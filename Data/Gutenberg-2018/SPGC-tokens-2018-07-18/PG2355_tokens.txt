summary
of

which
worms

in

history
of
the

in

introduction
the
share
which
worms
have
taken
in
the
formation
of
the
layer
of
vegetable
mould
which
covers
the
whole
surface
of
the
land
in
every
moderately
humid
country
is
the
subject
of
the
present
volume
this
mould
is
generally
of
a
blackish
colour
and
a
few
inches
in
thickness
in
different
districts
it
differs
but
little
in
appearance
although
it
may
rest
on
various
subsoils
the
uniform
fineness
of
the
particles
of
which
it
is
composed
is
one
of
its
chief
characteristic
features
and
this
may
be
well
observed
in
any
gravelly
country
where
a
field
immediately
adjoins
one
which
has
long
remained
undisturbed
for
pasture
and
where
the
vegetable
mould
is
exposed
on
the
sides
of
a
ditch
or
hole
the
subject
may
appear
an
insignificant
one
but
we
shall
see
that
it
possesses
some
interest
and
the
maxim
de
minimis
non
curat
lex
does
not
apply
to
science
even

de
beaumont
who
generally
undervalues
small
agencies
and
their
accumulated
effects

although
the
superficial
layer
of
vegetable
mould
as
a
whole
no
doubt
is
of
the
highest
antiquity
yet
in
regard
to
its
permanence
we
shall
hereafter
see
reason
to
believe
that
its
component
particles
are
in
most
cases
removed
at
not
a
very
slow
rate
and
are
replaced
by
others
due
to
the
disintegration
of
the
underlying
materials
as
i
was
led
to
keep
in
my
study
during
many
months
worms
in
pots
filled
with
earth
i
became
interested
in
them
and
wished
to
learn
how
far
they
acted
consciously
and
how
much
mental
power
they
displayed
i
was
the
more
desirous
to
learn
something
on
this
head
as
few
observations
of
this
kind
have
been
made
as
far
as
i
know
on
animals
so
low
in
the
scale
of
organization
and
so
poorly
provided
with
as
are
in
the
year
a
short
paper
was
read
by
me
before
the
geological
society
of
london
on
the
formation
of
mould
in
which
it
was
shown
that
small
fragments
of
burnt
marl
cinders
which
had
been
thickly
strewed
over
the
surface
of
several
meadows
were
found
after
a
few
years
lying
at
the
depth
of
some
inches
beneath
the
turf
but
still
forming
a
layer
this
apparent
sinking
of
superficial
bodies
is
due
as
was
first
suggested
to
me
by
wedgwood
of
maer
hall
in
staffordshire
to
the
large
quantity
of
fine
earth
continually
brought
up
to
the
surface
by
worms
in
the
form
of
castings
these
castings
are
sooner
or
later
spread
out
and
cover
up
any
object
left
on
the
surface
i
was
thus
led
to
conclude
that
all
the
vegetable
mould
over
the
whole
country
has
passed
many
times
through
and
will
again
pass
many
times
through
the
intestinal
canals
of
worms
hence
the
term
animal
mould
would
be
in
some
respects
more
appropriate
than
that
commonly
used
of
vegetable
ten
years
after
the
publication
of
my
paper
d
archiac
evidently
influenced
by
the
doctrines
of
élie
de
beaumont
wrote
about
my
singulière
théorie
and
objected
that
it
could
apply
only
to
les
prairies
basses
et
humides
and
that
les
terres
labourées
les
bois
les
prairies
élevées
n
apportent
aucune
preuve
à
l
appui
de
cette
manière
de
but
d
archiac
must
have
thus
argued
from
inner
consciousness
and
not
from
observation
for
worms
abound
to
an
extraordinary
degree
in
kitchen
gardens
where
the
soil
is
continually
worked
though
in
such
loose
soil
they
generally
deposit
their
castings
in
any
open
cavities
or
within
their
old
burrows
instead
of
on
the
surface
hensen
estimates
that
there
are
about
twice
as
many
worms
in
gardens
as
in
with
respect
to
prairies
élevées
i
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
in
france
but
nowhere
in
england
have
i
seen
the
ground
so
thickly
covered
with
castings
as
on
commons
at
a
height
of
several
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
in
woods
again
if
the
loose
leaves
in
autumn
are
removed
the
whole
surface
will
be
found
strewed
with
castings
king
the
superintendent
of
the
botanic
garden
in
calcutta
to
whose
kindness
i
am
indebted
for
many
observations
on
informs
me
that
he
found
near
nancy
in
france
the
bottom
of
the
state
forests
covered
over
many
acres
with
a
spongy
layer
composed
of
dead
leaves
and
innumerable
he
there
heard
the
professor
of
aménagement
des
forêts
lecturing
to
his
pupils
and
pointing
out
this
case
as
a
beautiful
example
of
the
natural
cultivation
of
the
soil
for
year
after
year
the
castings
cover
the
dead
leaves
the
result
being
a
rich
humus
of
great
in
the
year
mr
fish
rejected
my
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
part
which
worms
have
played
in
the
formation
of
vegetable
mould
merely
on
account
of
their
assumed
incapacity
to
do
so
much
work
he
remarks
that
considering
their
weakness
and
their
size
the
work
they
are
represented
to
have
accomplished
is
here
we
have
an
instance
of
that
inability
to
sum
up
the
effects
of
a
continually
recurrent
cause
which
has
often
retarded
the
progress
of
science
as
formerly
in
the
case
of
geology
and
more
recently
in
that
of
the
principle
of
evolution
although
these
several
objections
seemed
to
me
to
have
no
weight
yet
i
resolved
to
make
more
observations
of
the
same
kind
as
those
published
and
to
attack
the
problem
on
another
side
namely
to
weigh
all
the
castings
thrown
up
within
a
given
time
in
a
measured
space
instead
of
ascertaining
the
rate
at
which
objects
left
on
the
surface
were
buried
by
worms
but
some
of
my
observations
have
been
rendered
almost
superfluous
by
an
admirable
paper
by
hensen
already
alluded
to
which
appeared
in
before
entering
on
details
with
respect
to
the
castings
it
will
be
advisable
to
give
some
account
of
the
habits
of
worms
from
my
own
observations
and
from
those
of
other

the
british
species
of
lumbricus
have
never
been
carefully
monographed
but
we
may
judge
of
their
probable
number
from
those
inhabiting
neighbouring
countries
in
scandinavia
there
are
eight
species
according
to
eisen
but
two
of
these
rarely
burrow
in
the
ground
and
one
inhabits
very
wet
places
or
even
lives
under
the
water
we
are
here
concerned
only
with
the
kinds
which
bring
up
earth
to
the
surface
in
the
form
of
castings
hoffmeister
says
that
the
species
in
germany
are
not
well
known
but
gives
the
same
number
as
eisen
together
with
some
strongly
marked
varieties
abound
in
england
in
many
different
stations
their
castings
may
be
seen
in
extraordinary
numbers
on
commons
and
so
as
almost
to
cover
the
whole
surface
where
the
soil
is
poor
and
the
grass
short
and
thin
but
they
are
almost
or
quite
as
numerous
in
some
of
the
london
parks
where
the
grass
grows
well
and
the
soil
appears
rich
even
on
the
same
field
worms
are
much
more
frequent
in
some
places
than
in
others
without
any
visible
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
soil
they
abound
in
paved
close
to
houses
and
an
instance
will
be
given
in
which
they
had
burrowed
through
the
floor
of
a
very
damp
cellar
i
have
seen
worms
in
black
peat
in
a
boggy
field
but
they
are
extremely
rare
or
quite
absent
in
the
drier
brown
fibrous
peat
which
is
so
much
valued
by
gardeners
on
dry
sandy
or
gravelly
tracks
where
heath
with
some
gorse
ferns
coarse
grass
moss
and
lichens
alone
grow
hardly
any
worms
can
be
found
but
in
many
parts
of
england
wherever
a
path
crosses
a
heath
its
surface
becomes
covered
with
a
fine
short
sward
whether
this
change
of
vegetation
is
due
to
the
taller
plants
being
killed
by
the
occasional
trampling
of
man
and
animals
or
to
the
soil
being
occasionally
manured
by
the
droppings
from
animals
i
do
not
know
on
such
grassy
paths
may
often
be
seen
on
a
heath
in
surrey
which
was
carefully
examined
there
were
only
a
few
castings
on
these
paths
where
they
were
much
inclined
but
on
the
more
level
parts
where
a
bed
of
fine
earth
had
been
washed
down
from
the
steeper
parts
and
had
accumulated
to
a
thickness
of
a
few
inches
abounded
these
spots
seemed
to
be
overstocked
with
worms
so
that
they
had
been
compelled
to
spread
to
a
distance
of
a
few
feet
from
the
grassy
paths
and
here
their
castings
had
been
thrown
up
among
the
heath
but
beyond
this
limit
not
a
single
casting
could
be
found
a
layer
though
a
thin
one
of
fine
earth
which
probably
long
retains
some
moisture
is
in
all
cases
as
i
believe
necessary
for
their
existence
and
the
mere
compression
of
the
soil
appears
to
be
in
some
degree
favourable
to
them
for
they
often
abound
in
old
gravel
walks
and
in
across
fields
beneath
large
trees
few
castings
can
be
found
during
certain
seasons
of
the
year
and
this
is
apparently
due
to
the
moisture
having
been
sucked
out
of
the
ground
by
the
innumerable
roots
of
the
trees
for
such
places
may
be
seen
covered
with
castings
after
the
heavy
autumnal
rains
although
most
coppices
and
woods
support
many
worms
yet
in
a
forest
of
tall
and
ancient
in
knole
park
where
the
ground
beneath
was
bare
of
all
vegetation
not
a
single
casting
could
be
found
over
wide
spaces
even
during
the
autumn
nevertheless
castings
were
abundant
on
some
glades
and
indentations
which
penetrated
this
forest
on
the
mountains
of
north
wales
and
on
the
alps
worms
as
i
have
been
informed
are
in
most
places
rare
and
this
may
perhaps
be
due
to
the
close
proximity
of
the
subjacent
rocks
into
which
worms
can
not
burrow
during
the
winter
so
as
to
escape
being
frozen

at

of
feet
on

are

above

sea
and
at
a
great
altitude
on
the
nilgiri
mountains
in
south
india
and
on

himalaya
must
be
considered
as
terrestrial
animals

they
are
still
in
one
sense
like
the
other
members
of
the
great
class
of
annelids
to
which
they
belong
perrier
found
that
their
exposure
to
the
dry
air
of
a
room
for
only
a
single
night
was
fatal
to
them
on
the
other
hand
he
kept
several
large
worms
alive
for
nearly
four
months
completely
submerged
in
water
during
the
summer
when
the
ground
is
dry
they
penetrate
to
a
considerable
depth
and
cease
to
work
as
they
do
during
the
winter
when
the
ground
is
frozen
worms
are
nocturnal
in
their
habits
and
at
night
may
be
seen
crawling
about
in
large
numbers
but
usually
with
their
tails
still
inserted
in
their
burrows
by
the
expansion
of
this
part
of
their
bodies
and
with
the
help
of
the
short
slightly
reflexed
bristles
with
which
their
bodies
are
armed
they
hold
so
fast
that
they
can
seldom
be
dragged
out
of
the
ground
without
being
torn
into
pieces
during
the
day
they
remain
in
their
burrows
except
at
the
pairing
season
when
those
which
inhabit
adjoining
burrows
expose
the
greater
part
of
their
bodies
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
early
morning
sick
individuals
which
are
generally
affected
by
the
parasitic
larvæ
of
a
fly
must
also
be
excepted
as
they
wander
about
during
the
day
and
die
on
the
surface
after
heavy
rain
succeeding
dry
weather
an
astonishing
number
of
dead
worms
may
sometimes
be
seen
lying
on
the
ground
galton
informs
me
that
on
one
such
occasion
march
the
dead
worms
averaged
one
for
every
two
and
a
half
paces
in
length
on
a
walk
in
hyde
park
four
paces
in
width
he
counted
no
less
than
dead
worms
in
one
place
in
a
length
of
sixteen
paces
from
the
facts
above
given
it
is
not
probable
that
these
worms
could
have
been
drowned
and
if
they
had
been
drowned
they
would
have
perished
in
their
burrows
i
believe
that
they
were
already
sick
and
that
their
deaths
were
merely
hastened
by
the
ground
being
flooded
it
has
often
been
said
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
healthy
worms
never
or
very
rarely
completely
leave
their
burrows
at
night
but
this
is
an
error
as
white
of
selborne
long
ago
knew
in
the
morning
after
there
has
been
heavy
rain
the
film
of
mud
or
of
very
fine
sand
over
is
often
plainly
marked
with
their
tracks
i
have
noticed
this
from
august
to
may
both
months
included
and
it
probably
occurs
during
the
two
remaining
months
of
the
year
when
they
are
wet
on
these
occasions
very
few
dead
worms
could
anywhere
be
seen
on
january
after
a
and
unusually
severe
frost
with
much
snow
as
soon
as
a
thaw
set
in
the
walks
were
marked
with
innumerable
tracks
on
one
occasion
five
tracks
were
counted
crossing
a
space
of
only
an
inch
square
they
could
sometimes
be
traced
either
to
or
from
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
in
the
for
distances
between
or
up
to
yards
i
have
never
seen
two
tracks
leading
to
the
same
burrow
nor
is
it
likely
from
what
we
shall
presently
see
of
their
that
a
worm
could
find
its
way
back
to
its
burrow
after
having
once
left
it
they
apparently
leave
their
burrows
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
thus
they
find
new
sites
to
inhabit
morren
states
that
worms
often
lie
for
hours
almost
motionless
close
beneath
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
i
have
occasionally
noticed
the
same
fact
with
worms
kept
in
pots
in
the
house
so
that
by
looking
down
into
their
burrows
their
heads
could
just
be
seen
if
the
ejected
earth
or
rubbish
over
the
burrows
be
suddenly
removed
the
end
of
the
worm
s
body
may
very
often
be
seen
rapidly
retreating
this
habit
of
lying
near
the
surface
leads
to
their
destruction
to
an
immense
extent
every
morning
during
certain
seasons
of
the
year
the
thrushes
and
blackbirds
on
all
the
lawns
throughout
the
country
draw
out
of
their
holes
an
astonishing
number
of
worms
and
this
they
could
not
do
unless
they
lay
close
to
the
surface
it
is
not
probable
that
worms
behave
in
this
manner
for
the
sake
of
breathing
fresh
air
for
we
have
seen
that
they
can
live
for
a
long
time
under
water
i
believe
that
they
lie
near
the
surface
for
the
sake
of
warmth
especially
in
the
morning
and
we
shall
hereafter
find
that
they
often
coat
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
with
leaves
apparently
to
prevent
their
bodies
from
coming
into
close
contact
with
the
cold
damp
earth
it
is
said
that
they
completely
close
their
burrows
during
the
winter
few
remarks
must
be
made
on
this
subject
the
body
of
a
large
worm
consists
of
from
to
almost
cylindrical
rings
or
segments
each
furnished
with
minute
bristles
the
muscular
system
is
well
developed
worms
can
crawl
backwards
as
well
as
forwards
and
by
the
aid
of
their
affixed
tails
can
retreat
with
extraordinary
rapidity
into
their
burrows
the
mouth
is
situated
at
the
anterior
end
of
the
body
and
is
provided
with
a
little
projection
lobe
or
lip
as
it
has
been
variously
called
which
is
used
for
prehension
internally
behind
the
mouth
there
is
a
strong
pharynx
shown
in
the
accompanying
diagram
fig
which
is
pushed
forwards
when
the
animal
eats
and
this
part
corresponds
according
to
perrier
with
the
protrudable
trunk
or
proboscis
of
other
annelids
the
pharynx
leads
into
the
œsophagus
on
each
side
of
which
in
the
lower
part
there
are
three
pairs
of
large
glands
which
secrete
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonate
of
lime
these
calciferous
glands
are
highly
remarkable
for
nothing
like
them
is
known
in
any
other
animal
their
use
will
be
discussed
when
we
treat
of
the
digestive
process
in
most
of
the
species
the
œsophagus
is
enlarged
into
a
crop
in
front
of
the
gizzard
this
latter
organ
is
lined
with
a
smooth
thick
chitinous
membrane
and
is
surrounded
by
weak
longitudinal
but
powerful
transverse
muscles
perrier
saw
these
muscles
in
energetic
action
and
as
he
remarks
the
trituration
of
the
food
must
be
chiefly
effected
by
this
organ
for
worms
possess
no
jaws
or
teeth
of
any
kind
grains
of
sand
and
small
stones
from
the
to
a
little
more
than
the
inch
in
diameter
may
generally
be
found
in
their
gizzards
and
intestines
as
it
is
certain
that
worms
swallow
many
little
stones
independently
of
those
swallowed
while
excavating
their
burrows
it
is
probable
that
they
serve
like
to
triturate
their
food
the
gizzard
opens
into
the
intestine
which
runs
in
a
straight
course
to
the
vent
at
the
posterior
end
of
the
body
the
intestine
presents
a
remarkable
structure
the
typhlosolis
or
as
the
old
anatomists
called
it
an
intestine
within
an
intestine
and
claparède
has
shown
that
this
consists
of
a
deep
longitudinal
involution
of
the
walls
of
the
intestine
by
which
means
an
extensive
absorbent
surface
is
gained
picture
fig
diagram
of
the
alimentary
canal
of
an
fig
casting
from
near
nice
the
circulatory
system
is
well
developed
worms
breathe
by
their
skin
as
they
do
not
possess
any
special
respiratory
organs
the
two
sexes
are
united
in
the
same
individual
but
two
individuals
pair
together
the
nervous
system
is
fairly
well
developed
and
the
two
almost
confluent
cerebral
ganglia
are
situated
very
near
to
the
anterior
end
of
the
body
are
destitute
of
eyes
and
at
first
i
thought
that
they
were
quite
insensible
to
light
for
those
kept
in
confinement
were
repeatedly
observed
by
the
aid
of
a
candle
and
others
out
of
doors
by
the
aid
of
a
lantern
yet
they
were
rarely
alarmed
although
extremely
timid
animals
other
persons
have
found
no
difficulty
in
observing
worms
at
night
by
the
same
means
hoffmeister
however
states
that
worms
with
the
exception
of
a
few
individuals
are
extremely
sensitive
to
light
but
he
admits
that
in
most
cases
a
certain
time
is
requisite
for
its
action
these
statements
led
me
to
watch
on
many
successive
nights
worms
kept
in
pots
which
were
protected
from
currents
of
air
by
means
of
glass
plates
the
pots
were
approached
very
gently
in
order
that
no
vibration
of
the
floor
should
be
caused
when
under
these
circumstances
worms
were
illuminated
by
a
bull
lantern
having
slides
of
dark
red
and
blue
glass
which
intercepted
so
much
light
that
they
could
be
seen
only
with
some
difficulty
they
were
not
at
all
affected
by
this
amount
of
light
however
long
they
were
exposed
to
it
the
light
as
far
as
i
could
judge
was
brighter
than
that
from
the
full
moon
its
colour
apparently
made
no
difference
in
the
result
when
they
were
illuminated
by
a
candle
or
even
by
a
bright
paraffin
lamp
they
were
not
usually
affected
at
first
nor
were
they
when
the
light
was
alternately
admitted
and
shut
off
sometimes
however
they
behaved
very
differently
for
as
soon
as
the
light
fell
on
them
they
withdrew
into
their
burrows
with
almost
instantaneous
rapidity
this
occurred
perhaps
once
out
of
a
dozen
times
when
they
did
not
withdraw
instantly
they
often
raised
the
anterior
tapering
ends
of
their
bodies
from
the
ground
as
if
their
attention
was
aroused
or
as
if
surprise
was
felt
or
they
moved
their
bodies
from
side
to
side
as
if
feeling
for
some
object
they
appeared
distressed
by
the
light
but
i
doubt
whether
this
was
really
the
case
for
on
two
occasions
after
withdrawing
slowly
they
remained
for
a
long
time
with
their
anterior
extremities
protruding
a
little
from
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
in
which
position
they
were
ready
for
instant
and
complete
withdrawal
when
the
light
from
a
candle
was
concentrated
by
means
of
a
large
lens
on
the
anterior
extremity
they
generally
withdrew
instantly
but
this
concentrated
light
failed
to
act
perhaps
once
out
of
half
a
dozen
trials
the
light
was
on
one
occasion
concentrated
on
a
worm
lying
beneath
water
in
a
saucer
and
it
instantly
withdrew
into
its
burrow
in
all
cases
the
duration
of
the
light
unless
extremely
feeble
made
a
great
difference
in
the
result
for
worms
left
exposed
before
a
paraffin
lamp
or
a
candle
invariably
retreated
into
their
burrows
within
from
five
to
fifteen
minutes
and
if
in
the
evening
the
pots
were
illuminated
before
the
worms
had
come
out
of
their
burrows
they
failed
to
appear
from
the
foregoing
facts
it
is
evident
that
light
affects
worms
by
its
intensity
and
by
its
duration
it
is
only
the
anterior
extremity
of
the
body
where
the
cerebral
ganglia
lie
which
is
affected
by
light
as
hoffmeister
asserts
and
as
i
observed
on
many
occasions
if
this
part
is
shaded
other
parts
of
the
body
may
be
fully
illuminated
and
no
effect
will
be
produced
as
these
animals
have
no
eyes
we
must
suppose
that
the
light
passes
through
their
skins
and
in
some
manner
excites
their
cerebral
ganglia
it
appeared
at
first
probable
that
the
different
manner
in
which
they
were
affected
on
different
occasions
might
be
explained
either
by
the
degree
of
extension
of
their
skin
and
its
consequent
transparency
or
by
some
particular
incident
of
the
light
but
i
could
discover
no
such
relation
one
thing
was
manifest
namely
that
when
worms
were
employed
in
dragging
leaves
into
their
burrows
or
in
eating
them
and
even
during
the
short
intervals
whilst
they
rested
from
their
work
they
either
did
not
perceive
the
light
or
were
regardless
of
it
and
this
occurred
even
when
the
light
was
concentrated
on
them
through
a
large
lens
so
again
whilst
they
are
paired
they
will
remain
for
an
hour
or
two
out
of
their
burrows
fully
exposed
to
the
morning
light
but
it
appears
from
what
hoffmeister
says
that
a
light
will
occasionally
cause
paired
individuals
to
separate
when
a
worm
is
suddenly
illuminated
and
dashes
like
a
rabbit
into
its
use
the
expression
employed
by
a
are
at
first
led
to
look
at
the
action
as
a
reflex
one
the
irritation
of
the
cerebral
ganglia
appears
to
cause
certain
muscles
to
contract
in
an
inevitable
manner
independently
of
the
will
or
consciousness
of
the
animal
as
if
it
were
an
automaton
but
the
different
effect
which
a
light
produced
on
different
occasions
and
especially
the
fact
that
a
worm
when
in
any
way
employed
and
in
the
intervals
of
such
employment
whatever
set
of
muscles
and
ganglia
may
then
have
been
brought
into
play
is
often
regardless
of
light
are
opposed
to
the
view
of
the
sudden
withdrawal
being
a
simple
reflex
action
with
the
higher
animals
when
close
attention
to
some
object
leads
to
the
disregard
of
the
impressions
which
other
objects
must
be
producing
on
them
we
attribute
this
to
their
attention
being
then
absorbed
and
attention
implies
the
presence
of
a
mind
every
sportsman
knows
that
he
can
approach
animals
whilst
they
are
grazing
fighting
or
courting
much
more
easily
than
at
other
times
the
state
also
of
the
nervous
system
of
the
higher
animals
differs
much
at
different
times
for
instance
a
horse
is
much
more
readily
startled
at
one
time
than
at
another
the
comparison
here
implied
between
the
actions
of
one
of
the
higher
animals
and
of
one
so
low
in
the
scale
as
an
may
appear
for
we
thus
attribute
to
the
worm
attention
and
some
mental
power
nevertheless
i
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
the
justice
of
the
comparison
although
worms
can
not
be
said
to
possess
the
power
of
vision
their
sensitiveness
to
light
enables
them
to
distinguish
between
day
and
night
and
they
thus
escape
extreme
danger
from
the
many
diurnal
animals
which
prey
on
them
their
withdrawal
into
their
burrows
during
the
day
appears
however
to
have
become
an
habitual
action
for
worms
kept
in
pots
covered
by
glass
plates
over
which
sheets
of
black
paper
were
spread
and
placed
before
a
window
remained
during
the
in
their
burrows
and
came
out
every
night
and
they
continued
thus
to
act
for
a
week
no
doubt
a
little
light
may
have
entered
between
the
sheets
of
glass
and
the
blackened
paper
but
we
know
from
the
trials
with
coloured
glass
that
worms
are
indifferent
to
a
small
amount
of
light
worms
appear
to
be
less
sensitive
to
moderate
radiant
heat
than
to
a
bright
light
i
judge
of
this
from
having
held
at
different
times
a
poker
heated
to
dull
redness
near
some
worms
at
a
distance
which
caused
a
very
sensible
degree
of
warmth
in
my
hand
one
of
them
took
no
notice
a
second
withdrew
into
its
burrow
but
not
quickly
the
third
and
fourth
much
more
quickly
and
the
fifth
as
quickly
as
possible
the
light
from
a
candle
concentrated
by
a
lens
and
passing
through
a
sheet
of
glass
which
would
intercept
most
of
the
generally
caused
a
much
more
rapid
retreat
than
did
the
heated
poker
worms
are
sensitive
to
a
low
temperature
as
may
be
inferred
from
their
not
coming
out
of
their
burrows
during
a
frost
worms
do
not
possess
any
sense
of
hearing
they
took
not
the
least
notice
of
the
shrill
notes
from
a
metal
whistle
which
was
repeatedly
sounded
near
them
nor
did
they
of
the
deepest
and
loudest
tones
of
a
bassoon
they
were
indifferent
to
shouts
if
care
was
taken
that
the
breath
did
not
strike
them
when
placed
on
a
table
close
to
the
keys
of
a
piano
which
was
played
as
loudly
as
possible
they
remained
perfectly
quiet
although
they
are
indifferent
to
undulations
in
the
air
audible
by
us
they
are
extremely
sensitive
to
vibrations
in
any
solid
object
when
the
pots
containing
two
worms
which
had
remained
quite
indifferent
to
the
sound
of
the
piano
were
placed
on
this
instrument
and
the
note
c
in
the
bass
clef
was
struck
both
instantly
retreated
into
their
burrows
after
a
time
they
emerged
and
when
g
above
the
line
in
the
treble
clef
was
struck
they
again
retreated
under
similar
circumstances
on
another
night
one
worm
dashed
into
its
burrow
on
a
very
high
note
being
struck
only
once
and
the
other
worm
when
c
in
the
treble
clef
was
struck
on
these
occasions
the
worms
were
not
touching
the
sides
of
the
pots
which
stood
in
saucers
so
that
the
vibrations
before
reaching
their
bodies
had
to
pass
from
the
sounding
board
of
the
piano
through
the
saucer
the
bottom
of
the
pot
and
the
damp
not
very
compact
earth
on
which
they
lay
with
their
tails
in
their
burrows
they
often
showed
their
sensitiveness
when
the
pot
in
which
they
lived
or
the
table
on
which
the
pot
stood
was
accidentally
and
lightly
struck
but
they
appeared
less
sensitive
to
such
jars
than
to
the
vibrations
of
the
piano
and
their
sensitiveness
to
jars
varied
much
at
different
times
it
has
often
been
said
that
if
the
ground
is
beaten
or
otherwise
made
to
tremble
worms
believe
that
they
are
pursued
by
a
mole
and
leave
their
burrows
from
one
account
that
i
have
received
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
is
often
the
case
but
a
gentleman
informs
me
that
he
lately
saw
eight
or
ten
worms
leave
their
burrows
and
crawl
about
the
grass
on
some
boggy
land
on
which
two
men
had
just
trampled
while
setting
a
trap
and
this
occurred
in
a
part
of
ireland
where
there
were
no
moles
i
have
been
assured
by
a
volunteer
that
he
has
often
seen
many
large
crawling
quickly
about
the
grass
a
few
minutes
after
his
company
had
fired
a
volley
with
blank
cartridges
the
peewit
linn
seems
to
know
instinctively
that
worms
will
emerge
if
the
ground
is
made
to
tremble
for
bishop
stanley
states
as
i
hear
from
moorhouse
that
a
young
peewit
kept
in
confinement
used
to
stand
on
one
leg
and
beat
the
turf
with
the
other
leg
until
the
worms
crawled
out
of
their
burrows
when
they
were
instantly
devoured
nevertheless
worms
do
not
invariably
leave
their
burrows
when
the
ground
is
made
to
tremble
as
i
know
by
having
beaten
it
with
a
spade
but
perhaps
it
was
beaten
too
violently
the
whole
body
of
a
worm
is
sensitive
to
contact
a
slight
puff
of
air
from
the
mouth
causes
an
instant
retreat
the
glass
plates
placed
over
the
pots
did
not
fit
closely
and
blowing
through
the
very
narrow
chinks
thus
left
often
sufficed
to
cause
a
rapid
retreat
they
sometimes
perceived
the
eddies
in
the
air
caused
by
quickly
removing
the
glass
plates
when
a
worm
first
comes
out
of
its
burrow
it
generally
moves
the
much
extended
anterior
extremity
of
its
body
from
side
to
side
in
all
directions
apparently
as
an
organ
of
touch
and
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
that
they
are
thus
enabled
to
gain
a
general
notion
of
the
form
of
an
object
of
all
their
senses
that
of
touch
including
in
this
term
the
perception
of
a
vibration
seems
much
the
most
highly
developed
in
worms
the
sense
of
smell
apparently
is
confined
to
the
perception
of
certain
odours
and
is
feeble
they
were
quite
indifferent
to
my
breath
as
long
as
i
breathed
on
them
very
gently
this
was
tried
because
it
appeared
possible
that
they
might
thus
be
warned
of
the
approach
of
an
enemy
they
exhibited
the
same
indifference
to
my
breath
whilst
i
chewed
some
tobacco
and
while
a
pellet
of
with
a
few
drops
of
millefleurs
perfume
or
of
acetic
acid
was
kept
in
my
mouth
pellets
of
soaked
in
tobacco
juice
in
millefleurs
perfume
and
in
paraffin
were
held
with
pincers
and
were
waved
about
within
two
or
three
inches
of
several
worms
but
they
took
no
notice
on
one
or
two
occasions
however
when
acetic
acid
had
been
placed
on
the
pellets
the
worms
appeared
a
little
uneasy
and
this
was
probably
due
to
the
irritation
of
their
skins
the
perception
of
such
unnatural
odours
would
be
of
no
service
to
worms
and
as
such
timid
creatures
would
almost
certainly
exhibit
some
signs
of
any
new
impression
we
may
conclude
that
they
did
not
perceive
these
odours
the
result
was
different
when
and
pieces
of
onion
were
employed
both
of
which
are
devoured
with
much
relish
by
worms
small
square
pieces
of
fresh
and
and
of
onion
bulbs
were
on
nine
occasions
buried
in
my
pots
beneath
about
of
an
inch
of
common
garden
soil
and
they
were
always
discovered
by
the
worms
one
bit
of
cabbage
was
discovered
and
removed
in
the
course
of
two
hours
three
were
removed
by
the
next
morning
that
is
after
a
single
night
two
others
after
two
nights
and
the
seventh
bit
after
three
nights
two
pieces
of
onion
were
discovered
and
removed
after
three
nights
bits
of
fresh
raw
meat
of
which
worms
are
very
fond
were
buried
and
were
not
discovered
within
hours
during
which
time
they
had
not
become
putrid
the
earth
above
the
various
buried
objects
was
generally
pressed
down
only
slightly
so
as
not
to
prevent
the
emission
of
any
odour
on
two
occasions
however
the
surface
was
well
watered
and
was
thus
rendered
somewhat
compact
after
the
bits
of
cabbage
and
onion
had
been
removed
i
looked
beneath
them
to
see
whether
the
worms
had
accidentally
come
up
from
below
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
burrow
and
twice
the
buried
objects
were
laid
on
pieces
of
which
were
not
in
the
least
displaced
it
is
of
course
possible
that
the
worms
whilst
moving
about
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
with
their
tails
affixed
within
their
burrows
may
have
poked
their
heads
into
the
places
where
the
above
objects
were
buried
but
i
have
never
seen
worms
acting
in
this
manner
some
pieces
of
and
of
onion
were
twice
buried
beneath
very
fine
ferruginous
sand
which
was
slightly
pressed
down
and
well
watered
so
as
to
be
rendered
very
compact
and
these
pieces
were
never
discovered
on
a
third
occasion
the
same
kind
of
sand
was
neither
pressed
down
nor
watered
and
the
pieces
of
cabbage
were
discovered
and
removed
after
the
second
night
these
several
facts
indicate
that
worms
possess
some
power
of
smell
and
that
they
discover
by
this
means
odoriferous
and
kinds
of
food
it
may
be
presumed
that
all
animals
which
feed
on
various
substances
possess
the
sense
of
taste
and
this
is
certainly
the
case
with
worms
are
much
liked
by
worms
and
it
appears
that
they
can
distinguish
between
different
varieties
but
this
may
perhaps
be
owing
to
differences
in
their
texture
on
eleven
occasions
pieces
of
the
fresh
leaves
of
a
common
green
variety
and
of
the
red
variety
used
for
pickling
were
given
them
and
they
preferred
the
green
the
red
being
either
wholly
neglected
or
much
less
gnawed
on
two
other
occasions
however
they
seemed
to
prefer
the
red
leaves
of
the
red
variety
and
fresh
leaves
of
the
green
were
attacked
about
equally
when
leaves
of
the
cabbage
a
favourite
food
and
of
the
onion
were
given
together
the
latter
were
always
and
manifestly
preferred
leaves
of
the
cabbage
ampelopsis
parsnip
pastinaca
and
celery
apium
were
likewise
given
together
and
those
of
the
celery
were
first
eaten
but
when
leaves
of
cabbage
turnip
beet
celery
wild
cherry
and
carrots
were
given
together
the
two
latter
kinds
especially
those
of
the
carrot
were
preferred
to
all
the
others
including
those
of
celery
it
was
also
manifest
after
many
trials
that
wild
cherry
leaves
were
greatly
preferred
to
those
of
the
and
hazel
corylus
according
to
bridgman
the
leaves
of
are
particularly
liked
by
worms
pieces
of
the
leaves
of
cabbage
turnip
and
onion
were
left
on
the
pots
during
days
and
were
all
attacked
and
had
to
be
renewed
but
during
the
whole
of
this
time
leaves
of
an
artemisia
and
of
the
culinary
sage
thyme
and
mint
mingled
with
the
above
leaves
were
quite
neglected
excepting
those
of
the
mint
which
were
occasionally
and
very
slightly
nibbled
these
latter
four
kinds
of
leaves
do
not
differ
in
texture
in
a
manner
which
could
make
them
disagreeable
to
worms
they
all
have
a
strong
taste
but
so
have
the
four
first
mentioned
kinds
of
leaves
and
the
wide
difference
in
the
result
must
be
attributed
to
a
preference
by
the
worms
for
one
taste
over
another
is
little
to
be
said
on
this
head
we
have
seen
that
worms
are
timid
it
may
be
doubted
whether
they
suffer
as
much
pain
when
injured
as
they
seem
to
express
by
their
contortions
judging
by
their
eagerness
for
certain
kinds
of
food
they
must
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
eating
their
sexual
passion
is
strong
enough
to
overcome
for
a
time
their
dread
of
light
they
perhaps
have
a
trace
of
social
feeling
for
they
are
not
disturbed
by
crawling
over
each
other
s
bodies
and
they
sometimes
lie
in
contact
according
to
hoffmeister
they
pass
the
winter
either
singly
or
rolled
up
with
others
into
a
ball
at
the
bottom
of
their
burrows
although
worms
are
so
remarkably
deficient
in
the
several
this
does
not
necessarily
preclude
intelligence
as
we
know
from
such
cases
as
those
of
laura
bridgman
and
we
have
seen
that
when
their
attention
is
engaged
they
neglect
impressions
to
which
they
would
otherwise
have
attended
and
attention
indicates
the
presence
of
a
mind
of
some
kind
they
are
also
much
more
easily
excited
at
certain
times
than
at
others
they
perform
a
few
actions
instinctively
that
is
all
the
individuals
including
the
young
perform
such
actions
in
nearly
the
same
fashion
this
is
shown
by
the
manner
in
which
the
species
of
perichæta
eject
their
castings
so
as
to
construct
towers
also
by
the
manner
in
which
the
burrows
of
the
common
are
smoothly
lined
with
fine
earth
and
often
with
little
stones
and
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
with
leaves
one
of
their
strongest
instincts
is
the
plugging
up
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
with
various
objects
and
very
young
worms
act
in
this
manner
but
some
degree
of
intelligence
appears
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
to
be
exhibited
in
this
work
result
which
has
surprised
me
more
than
anything
else
in
regard
to
worms
and
are
omnivorous
they
swallow
an
enormous
quantity
of
earth
out
of
which
they
extract
any
digestible
matter
which
it
may
contain
but
to
this
subject
i
must
recur
they
also
consume
a
large
number
of
leaves
of
all
kinds
excepting
a
few
which
have
an
unpleasant
taste
or
are
too
tough
for
them
likewise
petioles
peduncles
and
decayed
flowers
but
they
will
also
consume
fresh
leaves
as
i
have
found
by
repeated
trials
according
to
morren
they
will
eat
particles
of
sugar
and
liquorice
and
the
worms
which
i
kept
drew
many
bits
of
dry
starch
into
their
burrows
and
a
large
bit
had
its
angles
well
rounded
by
the
fluid
poured
out
of
their
mouths
but
as
they
often
drag
particles
of
soft
stone
such
as
of
chalk
into
their
burrows
i
feel
some
doubt
whether
the
starch
was
used
as
food
pieces
of
raw
and
roasted
meat
were
fixed
several
times
by
long
pins
to
the
surface
of
the
soil
in
my
pots
and
night
after
night
the
worms
could
be
seen
tugging
at
them
with
the
edges
of
the
pieces
engulfed
in
their
mouths
so
that
much
was
consumed
raw
fat
seems
to
be
preferred
even
to
raw
meat
or
to
any
other
substance
which
was
given
them
and
much
was
consumed
they
are
cannibals
for
the
two
halves
of
a
dead
worm
placed
in
two
of
the
pots
were
dragged
into
the
burrows
and
gnawed
but
as
far
as
i
could
judge
they
prefer
fresh
to
putrid
meat
and
in
so
far
i
differ
from
hoffmeister
léon
fredericq
states
that
the
digestive
fluid
of
worms
is
of
the
same
nature
as
the
pancreatic
secretion
of
the
higher
animals
and
this
conclusion
agrees
perfectly
with
the
kinds
of
food
which
worms
consume
pancreatic
juice
emulsifies
fat
and
we
have
just
seen
how
greedily
worms
devour
fat
it
dissolves
fibrin
and
worms
eat
raw
meat
it
converts
starch
into
with
wonderful
rapidity
and
we
shall
presently
show
that
the
digestive
fluid
of
worms
acts
on
starch
but
they
live
chiefly
on
leaves
and
these
would
be
useless
to
them
unless
they
could
digest
the
cellulose
forming
the
for
it
is
well
known
that
all
other
nutritious
substances
are
almost
completely
withdrawn
from
leaves
shortly
before
they
fall
off
it
has
however
now
been
ascertained
that
some
forms
of
cellulose
though
very
little
or
not
at
all
attacked
by
the
gastric
secretion
of
the
higher
animals
are
acted
on
by
that
from
the
pancreas
the
or
fresh
leaves
which
worms
intend
to
devour
are
dragged
into
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
to
a
depth
of
from
one
to
three
inches
and
are
then
moistened
with
a
secreted
fluid
it
has
been
assumed
that
this
fluid
serves
to
hasten
their
decay
but
a
large
number
of
leaves
were
twice
pulled
out
of
the
burrows
of
worms
and
kept
for
many
weeks
in
a
very
moist
atmosphere
under
a
in
my
study
and
the
parts
which
had
been
moistened
by
the
worms
did
not
decay
more
quickly
in
any
plain
manner
than
the
other
parts
when
fresh
leaves
were
given
in
the
evening
to
worms
kept
in
confinement
and
examined
early
on
the
next
morning
therefore
not
many
hours
after
they
had
been
dragged
into
the
burrows
the
fluid
with
which
they
were
moistened
when
tested
with
neutral
litmus
paper
showed
an
alkaline
reaction
this
was
repeatedly
found
to
be
the
case
with
celery
cabbage
and
turnip
leaves
parts
of
the
same
leaves
which
had
not
been
moistened
by
the
worms
were
pounded
with
a
few
drops
of
distilled
water
and
the
juice
thus
extracted
was
not
alkaline
some
leaves
however
which
had
been
drawn
into
burrows
out
of
doors
at
an
unknown
antecedent
period
were
tried
and
though
still
moist
they
rarely
exhibited
even
a
trace
of
alkaline
reaction
the
fluid
with
which
the
leaves
are
bathed
acts
on
them
whilst
they
are
fresh
or
nearly
fresh
in
a
remarkable
manner
for
it
quickly
kills
and
discolours
them
thus
the
ends
of
a
fresh
which
had
been
dragged
into
a
burrow
were
found
after
twelve
hours
of
a
dark
brown
tint
leaves
of
celery
turnip
maple
elm
lime
thin
leaves
of
ivy
and
occasionally
those
of
the
cabbage
were
similarly
acted
on
the
end
of
a
leaf
of
still
attached
to
a
growing
plant
had
been
drawn
into
a
burrow
and
this
part
was
dark
brown
and
dead
whilst
the
rest
of
the
leaf
was
fresh
and
green
several
leaves
of
lime
and
elm
removed
from
burrows
out
of
doors
were
found
affected
in
different
degrees
the
first
change
appears
to
be
that
the
veins
become
of
a
dull
the
cells
with
chlorophyll
next
lose
more
or
less
completely
their
green
colour
and
their
contents
finally
become
brown
the
parts
thus
affected
often
appeared
almost
black
by
reflected
light
but
when
viewed
as
a
transparent
object
under
the
microscope
minute
specks
of
light
were
transmitted
and
this
was
not
the
case
with
the
unaffected
parts
of
the
same
leaves
these
effects
however
merely
show
that
the
secreted
fluid
is
highly
injurious
or
poisonous
to
leaves
for
nearly
the
same
effects
were
produced
in
from
one
to
two
days
on
various
kinds
of
young
leaves
not
only
by
artificial
pancreatic
fluid
prepared
with
or
without
thymol
but
quickly
by
a
solution
of
thymol
by
itself
on
one
occasion
leaves
of
corylus
were
much
discoloured
by
being
kept
for
eighteen
hours
in
pancreatic
fluid
without
any
thymol
with
young
and
tender
leaves
immersion
in
human
saliva
during
rather
warm
weather
acted
in
the
same
manner
as
the
pancreatic
fluid
but
not
so
quickly
the
leaves
in
all
these
cases
often
became
infiltrated
with
the
fluid
large
leaves
from
an
ivy
plant
growing
on
a
wall
were
so
tough
that
they
could
not
be
gnawed
by
worms
but
after
four
days
they
were
affected
in
a
peculiar
manner
by
the
secretion
poured
out
of
their
mouths
the
upper
surfaces
of
the
leaves
over
which
the
worms
had
crawled
as
was
shown
by
the
dirt
left
on
them
were
marked
in
sinuous
lines
by
either
a
continuous
or
broken
chain
of
whitish
and
often
dots
about
mm
in
diameter
the
appearance
thus
presented
was
curiously
like
that
of
a
leaf
into
which
the
larva
of
some
minute
insect
had
burrowed
but
my
son
francis
after
making
and
examining
sections
could
nowhere
find
that
the
had
been
broken
down
or
that
the
epidermis
had
been
penetrated
when
the
section
passed
through
the
whitish
dots
the
grains
of
chlorophyll
were
seen
to
be
more
or
less
discoloured
and
some
of
the
palisade
and
mesophyll
cells
contained
nothing
but
broken
down
granular
matter
these
effects
must
be
attributed
to
the
transudation
of
the
secretion
through
the
epidermis
into
the
cells
the
secretion
with
which
worms
moisten
leaves
likewise
acts
on
the
within
the
cells
my
son
examined
some
leaves
of
the
ash
and
many
of
the
lime
which
had
fallen
off
the
trees
and
had
been
partly
dragged
into
it
is
known
that
with
fallen
leaves
the
are
preserved
in
the
of
the
stomata
now
in
several
cases
the
starch
had
partially
or
wholly
disappeared
from
these
cells
in
the
parts
which
had
been
moistened
by
the
secretion
while
it
was
still
well
preserved
in
the
other
parts
of
the
same
leaves
sometimes
the
starch
was
dissolved
out
of
only
one
of
the

the
nucleus
in
one
case
had
disappeared
together
with
the
the
mere
burying
of
in
damp
earth
for
nine
days
did
not
cause
the
destruction
of
the
on
the
other
hand
the
immersion
of
fresh
lime
and
cherry
leaves
for
eighteen
hours
in
artificial
pancreatic
fluid
led
to
the
dissolution
of
the
in
the
as
well
as
in
the
other
cells
from
the
secretion
with
which
the
leaves
are
moistened
being
alkaline
and
from
its
acting
both
on
the
and
on
the
protoplasmic
contents
of
the
cells
we
may
infer
that
it
resembles
in
nature
not
saliva
but
pancreatic
secretion
and
we
know
from
fredericq
that
a
secretion
of
this
kind
is
found
in
the
intestines
of
worms
as
the
leaves
which
are
dragged
into
the
burrows
are
often
dry
and
shrivelled
it
is
indispensable
for
their
disintegration
by
the
unarmed
mouths
of
worms
that
they
should
first
be
moistened
and
softened
and
fresh
leaves
however
soft
and
tender
they
may
be
are
similarly
treated
probably
from
habit
the
result
is
that
they
are
partially
digested
before
they
are
taken
into
the
alimentary
canal
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
case
of
digestion
having
been
recorded
the
is
said
to
bathe
its
prey
with
saliva
but
this
is
doubtful
and
it
is
done
solely
for
the
sake
of
lubricating
its
prey
perhaps
the
nearest
analogy
may
be
found
in
such
plants
as
drosera
and
dionæa
for
here
animal
matter
is
digested
and
converted
into
peptone
not
within
a
stomach
but
on
the
surfaces
of
the
leaves
glands
see
fig
judging
from
their
size
and
from
their
rich
supply
of
must
be
of
much
importance
to
the
animal
but
almost
as
many
theories
have
been
advanced
on
their
use
as
there
have
been
observers
they
consist
of
three
pairs
which
in
the
common
debouch
into
the
alimentary
canal
in
advance
of
the
gizzard
but
posteriorly
to
it
in
urochæta
and
some
other
genera
the
two
posterior
pairs
are
formed
by
lamellæ
which
according
to
claparède
are
diverticula
from
the
œsophagus
these
lamellæ
are
coated
with
a
pulpy
cellular
layer
with
the
outer
cells
lying
free
in
infinite
numbers
if
one
of
these
glands
is
punctured
and
squeezed
a
quantity
of
white
pulpy
matter
exudes
consisting
of
these
free
cells
they
are
minute
and
vary
in
diameter
from
to
they
contain
in
their
centres
a
little
excessively
fine
granular
matter
but
they
look
so
like
oil
globules
that
claparède
and
others
at
first
treated
them
with
ether
this
produces
no
effect
but
they
are
quickly
dissolved
with
effervescence
in
acetic
acid
and
when
oxalate
of
ammonia
is
added
to
the
solution
a
white
precipitate
is
thrown
down
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
they
contain
carbonate
of
lime
if
the
cells
are
immersed
in
a
very
little
acid
they
become
more
transparent
look
like
ghosts
and
are
soon
lost
to
view
but
if
much
acid
is
added
they
disappear
instantly
after
a
very
large
number
have
been
dissolved
a
flocculent
residue
is
left
which
apparently
consists
of
the
delicate
ruptured
in
the
two
posterior
pairs
of
glands
the
carbonate
of
lime
contained
in
the
cells
occasionally
aggregates
into
small
rhombic
crystals
or
into
concretions
which
lie
between
the
lamellæ
but
i
have
seen
only
one
case
and
claparède
only
a
very
few
such
cases
the
two
anterior
glands
differ
a
little
in
shape
from
the
four
posterior
ones
by
being
more
oval
they
differ
also
conspicuously
in
generally
containing
several
small
or
two
or
three
larger
or
a
single
very
large
concretion
of
carbonate
of
lime
as
much
as
mm
in
diameter
when
a
gland
includes
only
a
few
very
small
concretions
or
as
sometimes
happens
none
at
all
it
is
easily
overlooked
the
large
concretions
are
round
or
oval
and
exteriorly
almost
smooth
one
was
found
which
filled
up
not
only
the
whole
gland
as
is
often
the
case
but
its
neck
so
that
it
resembled
an
flask
in
shape
these
concretions
when
broken
are
seen
to
be
more
or
less
crystalline
in
structure
how
they
escape
from
the
gland
is
a
marvel
but
that
they
do
escape
is
certain
for
they
are
often
found
in
the
gizzard
intestines
and
in
the
castings
of
worms
both
with
those
kept
in
confinement
and
those
in
a
state
of
nature
claparède
says
very
little
about
the
structure
of
the
two
anterior
glands
and
he
supposes
that
the
calcareous
matter
of
which
the
concretions
are
formed
is
derived
from
the
four
posterior
glands
but
if
an
anterior
gland
which
contains
only
small
concretions
is
placed
in
acetic
acid
and
afterwards
dissected
or
if
sections
are
made
of
such
a
gland
without
being
treated
with
acid
lamellæ
like
those
in
the
posterior
glands
and
coated
with
cellular
matter
could
be
plainly
seen
together
with
a
multitude
of
free
calciferous
cells
readily
soluble
in
acetic
acid
when
a
gland
is
completely
filled
with
a
single
large
concretion
there
are
no
free
cells
as
these
have
been
all
consumed
in
forming
the
concretion
but
if
such
a
concretion
or
one
of
only
moderately
large
size
is
dissolved
in
acid
much
membranous
matter
is
left
which
appears
to
consist
of
the
remains
of
the
formerly
active
lamellæ
after
the
formation
and
expulsion
of
a
large
concretion
new
lamellæ
must
be
developed
in
some
manner
in
one
section
made
by
my
son
the
process
had
apparently
commenced
although
the
gland
contained
two
rather
large
concretions
for
near
the
walls
several
cylindrical
and
oval
pipes
were
intersected
which
were
lined
with
cellular
matter
and
were
quite
filled
with
free
calciferous
cells
a
great
enlargement
in
one
direction
of
several
oval
pipes
would
give
rise
to
the
lamellæ
besides
the
free
calciferous
cells
in
which
no
nucleus
was
visible
other
and
rather
larger
free
cells
were
seen
on
three
occasions
and
these
contained
a
distinct
nucleus
and
nucleolus
they
were
only
so
far
acted
on
by
acetic
acid
that
the
nucleus
was
thus
rendered
more
distinct
a
very
small
concretion
was
removed
from
between
two
of
the
lamellæ
within
an
anterior
gland
it
was
imbedded
in
pulpy
cellular
matter
with
many
free
calciferous
cells
together
with
a
multitude
of
the
larger
free
nucleated
cells
and
these
latter
cells
were
not
acted
on
by
acetic
acid
while
the
former
were
dissolved
from
this
and
other
such
cases
i
am
led
to
suspect
that
the
calciferous
cells
are
developed
from
the
larger
nucleated
ones
but
how
this
was
effected
was
not
ascertained
when
an
anterior
gland
contains
several
minute
concretions
some
of
these
are
generally
angular
or
crystalline
in
outline
while
the
greater
number
are
rounded
with
an
irregular
surface
calciferous
cells
adhered
to
many
parts
of
these
masses
and
their
gradual
disappearance
could
be
traced
while
they
still
remained
attached
it
was
thus
evident
that
the
concretions
are
formed
from
the
lime
contained
within
the
free
calciferous
cells
as
the
smaller
concretions
increase
in
size
they
come
into
contact
and
unite
thus
enclosing
the
now
functionless
lamellæ
and
by
such
steps
the
formation
of
the
largest
concretions
could
be
followed
why
the
process
regularly
takes
place
in
the
two
anterior
glands
and
only
rarely
in
the
four
posterior
glands
is
quite
unknown
morren
says
that
these
glands
disappear
during
the
winter
and
i
have
seen
some
instances
of
this
fact
and
others
in
which
either
the
anterior
or
posterior
glands
were
at
this
season
so
shrunk
and
empty
that
they
could
be
distinguished
only
with
much
difficulty
with
respect
to
the
function
of
the
calciferous
glands
it
is
probable
that
they
primarily
serve
as
organs
of
excretion
and
secondarily
as
an
aid
to
digestion
worms
consume
many
fallen
leaves
and
it
is
known
that
lime
goes
on
accumulating
in
leaves
until
they
drop
off
the
instead
of
being
into
the
stem
or
roots
like
various
other
organic
and
inorganic
substances
the
ashes
of
a
leaf
of
an
acacia
have
been
known
to
contain
as
much
as
per
cent
of
lime
worms
therefore
would
be
liable
to
become
charged
with
this
earth
unless
there
were
some
special
means
for
its
excretion
and
the
calciferous
glands
are
well
adapted
for
this
purpose
the
worms
which
live
in
mould
close
over
the
chalk
often
have
their
intestines
filled
with
this
substance
and
their
castings
are
almost
white
here
it
is
evident
that
the
supply
of
calcareous
matter
must
be
nevertheless
with
several
worms
collected
on
such
a
site
the
calciferous
glands
contained
as
many
free
calciferous
cells
and
fully
as
many
and
large
concretions
as
did
the
glands
of
worms
which
lived
where
there
was
little
or
no
lime
and
this
indicates
that
the
lime
is
an
excretion
and
not
a
secretion
poured
into
the
alimentary
canal
for
some
special
purpose
on
the
other
hand
the
following
considerations
render
it
highly
probable
that
the
carbonate
of
lime
which
is
excreted
by
the
glands
aids
the
digestive
process
under
ordinary
circumstances
leaves
during
their
decay
generate
an
abundance
of
various
kinds
of
acids
which
have
been
grouped
together
under
the
term
of
humus
acids
we
shall
have
to
recur
to
this
subject
in
our
fifth
chapter
and
i
need
here
only
say
that
these
acids
act
strongly
on
carbonate
of
lime
the
leaves
which
are
swallowed
in
such
large
quantities
by
worms
would
therefore
after
they
have
been
moistened
and
triturated
in
the
alimentary
canal
be
apt
to
produce
such
acids
and
in
the
case
of
several
worms
the
contents
of
the
alimentary
canal
were
found
to
be
plainly
acid
as
shown
by
litmus
paper
this
acidity
can
not
be
attributed
to
the
nature
of
the
digestive
fluid
for
pancreatic
fluid
is
alkaline
and
we
have
seen
that
the
secretion
which
is
poured
out
of
the
mouths
of
worms
for
the
sake
of
preparing
the
leaves
for
consumption
is
likewise
alkaline
the
acidity
can
hardly
be
due
to
uric
acid
as
the
contents
of
the
upper
part
of
the
intestine
were
often
acid
in
one
case
the
contents
of
the
gizzard
were
slightly
acid
those
of
the
upper
intestines
being
more
plainly
acid
in
another
case
the
contents
of
the
pharynx
were
not
acid
those
of
the
gizzard
doubtfully
so
while
those
of
the
intestine
were
distinctly
acid
at
a
distance
of
cm
below
the
gizzard
even
with
the
higher
herbivorous
and
omnivorous
animals
the
contents
of
the
large
intestine
are
acid
this
however
is
not
caused
by
any
acid
secretion
from
the
mucous
membrane
the
reaction
of
the
intestinal
walls
in
the
larger
as
in
the
small
intestine
is
alkaline
it
must
therefore
arise
from
acid
fermentations
going
on
in
the
contents
themselves
in
carnivora
the
contents
of
the
coecum
are
said
to
be
alkaline
and
naturally
the
amount
of
fermentation
will
depend
largely
on
the
nature
of
the
with
worms
not
only
the
contents
of
the
intestines
but
their
ejected
matter
or
the
castings
are
generally
acid
thirty
castings
from
different
places
were
tested
and
with
three
or
four
exceptions
were
found
to
be
acid
and
the
exceptions
may
have
been
due
to
such
castings
not
having
been
recently
ejected
for
some
which
were
at
first
acid
were
on
the
following
morning
after
being
dried
and
again
moistened
no
longer
acid
and
this
probably
resulted
from
the
humus
acids
being
as
is
known
to
be
the
case
easily
decomposed
five
fresh
castings
from
worms
which
lived
in
mould
close
over
the
chalk
were
of
a
whitish
colour
and
abounded
with
calcareous
matter
and
these
were
not
in
the
least
acid
this
shows
how
effectually
carbonate
of
lime
neutralises
the
intestinal
acids
when
worms
were
kept
in
pots
filled
with
fine
ferruginous
sand
it
was
manifest
that
the
oxide
of
iron
with
which
the
grains
of
silex
were
coated
had
been
dissolved
and
removed
from
them
in
the
castings
the
digestive
fluid
of
worms
resembles
in
its
action
as
already
stated
the
pancreatic
secretion
of
the
higher
animals
and
in
these
latter
pancreatic
digestion
is
essentially
alkaline
the
action
will
not
take
place
unless
some
alkali
be
present
and
the
activity
of
an
alkaline
juice
is
arrested
by
acidification
and
hindered
by
therefore
it
seems
highly
probable
that
the
innumerable
calciferous
cells
which
are
poured
from
the
four
posterior
glands
into
the
alimentary
canal
of
worms
serve
to
neutralise
more
or
less
completely
the
acids
there
generated
by
the
leaves
we
have
seen
that
these
cells
are
instantly
dissolved
by
a
small
quantity
of
acetic
acid
and
as
they
do
not
always
suffice
to
neutralise
the
contents
of
even
the
upper
part
of
the
alimentary
canal
the
lime
is
perhaps
aggregated
into
concretions
in
the
anterior
pair
of
glands
in
order
that
some
may
be
carried
down
to
the
posterior
parts
of
the
intestine
where
these
concretions
would
be
rolled
about
amongst
the
acid
contents
the
concretions
found
in
the
intestines
and
in
the
castings
often
have
a
worn
appearance
but
whether
this
is
due
to
some
amount
of
attrition
or
of
chemical
corrosion
could
not
be
told
claparède
believes
that
they
are
formed
for
the
sake
of
acting
as
and
of
thus
aiding
in
the
trituration
of
the
food
they
may
give
some
aid
in
this
way
but
i
fully
agree
with
perrier
that
this
must
be
of
quite
subordinate
importance
seeing
that
the
object
is
already
attained
by
stones
being
generally
present
in
the
gizzards
and
intestines

thus
of
of

for

that

exhibit

by
which
they
excavate

leaves
were
pinned
down
to
the
soil
and
at
night
the
manner
in
which
they
were
seized
could
be
observed
the
worms
always
endeavoured
to
drag
the
leaves
towards
their
burrows
and
they
tore
or
sucked
off
small
fragments
whenever
the
leaves
were
sufficiently
tender
they
generally
seized
the
thin
edge
of
a
leaf
with
their
mouths
between
the
projecting
upper
and
lower
lip
the
thick
and
strong
pharynx
being
at
the
same
time
as
perrier
remarks
pushed
forward
within
their
bodies
so
as
to
afford
a
point
of
resistance
for
the
upper
lip
in
the
case
of
broad
flat
objects
they
acted
in
a
wholly
different
manner
the
pointed
anterior
extremity
of
the
body
after
being
brought
into
contact
with
an
object
of
this
kind
was
drawn
within
the
adjoining
rings
so
that
it
appeared
truncated
and
became
as
thick
as
the
rest
of
the
body
this
part
could
then
be
seen
to
swell
a
little
and
this
i
believe
is
due
to
the
pharynx
being
pushed
a
little
forwards
then
by
a
slight
withdrawal
of
the
pharynx
or
by
its
expansion
a
vacuum
was
produced
beneath
the
truncated
slimy
end
of
the
body
whilst
in
contact
with
the
object
and
by
this
means
the
two
adhered
firmly
together
that
under
these
circumstances
a
vacuum
was
produced
was
plainly
seen
on
one
occasion
when
a
large
worm
lying
beneath
a
flaccid
cabbage
leaf
tried
to
drag
it
away
for
the
surface
of
the
leaf
directly
over
the
end
of
the
worm
s
body
became
deeply
pitted
on
another
occasion
a
worm
suddenly
lost
its
hold
on
a

leaf
and
the

end
of
the

attach
themselves
to
an
object
beneath
water
in
the
same
manner
and
i
saw
one
thus
dragging
away
a
submerged
slice
of
an
the
edges
of
fresh
or
nearly
fresh
leaves
affixed
to
the
ground
were
often
nibbled
by
the
worms
and
sometimes
the
epidermis
and
all
the
parenchyma
on
one
side
was
gnawed
completely
away
over
a
considerable
space
the
epidermis
alone
on
the
opposite
side
being
left
quite
clean
the
veins
were
never
touched
and
leaves
were
thus
sometimes
partly
converted
into
skeletons
as
worms
have
no
teeth
and
as
their
mouths
consist
of
very
soft
tissue
it
may
be
presumed
that
they
consume
by
means
of
suction
the
edges
and
the
parenchyma
of
fresh
leaves
after
they
have
been
softened
by
the
digestive
fluid
they
can
not
attack
such
strong
leaves
as
those
of
or
large
and
thick
leaves
of
ivy
though
one
of
the
latter
after
it
had
become
rotten
was
reduced
in
parts
to
the
state
of
a
skeleton
worms
seize
leaves
and
other
objects
not
only
to
serve
as
food
but
for
plugging
up
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
and
this
is
one
of
their
strongest
instincts
they
sometimes
work
so
energetically
that
simpson
who
has
a
small
walled
garden
where
worms
abound
in
bayswater
informs
me
that
on
a
calm
damp
evening
he
there
heard
so
extraordinary
a
rustling
noise
from
under
a
tree
from
which
many
leaves
had
fallen
that
he
went
out
with
a
light
and
discovered
that
the
noise
was
caused
by
many
worms
dragging
the
dry
leaves
and
squeezing
them
into
the
burrows
not
only
leaves
but
petioles
of
many
kinds
some
often
decayed
twigs
of
trees
bits
of
paper
feathers
tufts
of
wool
and
are
dragged
into
their
burrows
for
this
purpose
i
have
seen
as
many
as
seventeen
petioles
of
a
clematis
projecting
from
the
mouth
of
one
burrow
and
ten
from
the
mouth
of
another
some
of
these
objects
such
as
the
petioles
just
named
feathers
are
never
gnawed
by
worms
in
a
in
my
garden
i
found
many
hundred
leaves
of
a
or
drawn
by
their
bases
into
burrows
the
surfaces
by
which
these
leaves
are
articulated
to
the
branches
are
shaped
in
as
peculiar
a
manner
as
is
the
joint
between
the
of
a
quadruped
and
if
these
surfaces
had
been
in
the
least
gnawed
the
fact
would
have
been
immediately
visible
but
there
was
no
trace
of
gnawing
of
ordinary
dicotyledonous
leaves
all
those
which
are
dragged
into
burrows
are
not
gnawed
i
have
seen
as
many
as
nine
leaves
of
the
drawn
into
the
same
burrow
and
not
nearly
all
of
them
had
been
gnawed
but
such
leaves
may
serve
as
a
store
for
future
consumption
where
fallen
leaves
are
abundant
many
more
are
sometimes
collected
over
the
mouth
of
a
burrow
than
can
be
used
so
that
a
small
pile
of
unused
leaves
is
left
like
a
roof
over
those
which
have
been
partly
dragged
in
a
leaf
in
being
dragged
a
little
way
into
a
cylindrical
burrow
is
necessarily
much
folded
or
crumpled
when
another
leaf
is
drawn
in
this
is
done
exteriorly
to
the
first
one
and
so
on
with
the
succeeding
leaves
and
finally
all
become
closely
folded
and
pressed
together
sometimes
the
worm
enlarges
the
mouth
of
its
burrow
or
makes
a
fresh
one
close
by
so
as
to
draw
in
a
still
larger
number
of
leaves
they
often
or
generally
fill
up
the
interstices
between
the
leaves
with
moist
viscid
earth
ejected
from
their
bodies
and
thus
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
are
securely
plugged
hundreds
of
such
plugged
burrows
may
be
seen
in
many
places
especially
during
the
autumnal
and
early
winter
months
but
as
will
hereafter
be
shown
leaves
are
dragged
into
the
burrows
not
only
for
plugging
them
up
and
for
food
but
for
the
sake
of
lining
the
upper
part
or
mouth
when
worms
can
not
obtain
leaves
petioles
sticks
with
which
to
plug
up
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
they
often
protect
them
by
little
heaps
of
stones
and
such
heaps
of
smooth
rounded
pebbles
may
frequently
be
seen
on
here
there
can
be
no
question
about
food
a
lady
who
was
interested
in
the
habits
of
worms
removed
the
little
heaps
of
stones
from
the
mouths
of
several
burrows
and
cleared
the
surface
of
the
ground
for
some
inches
all
round
she
went
out
on
the
following
night
with
a
lantern
and
saw
the
worms
with
their
tails
fixed
in
their
burrows
dragging
the
stones
inwards
by
the
aid
of
their
mouths
no
doubt
by
suction
after
two
nights
some
of
the
holes
had
or
small
stones
over
them
after
four
nights
one
had
about
and
another
one
had
been
dragged
over
the
to
the
mouth
of
a
burrow
weighed
two
ounces
and
this
proves
how
strong
worms
are
but
they
show
greater
strength
in
sometimes
displacing
stones
in
a
that
they
do
so
may
be
inferred
from
the
cavities
left
by
the
displaced
stones
being
exactly
filled
by
those
lying
over
the
mouths
of
adjoining
burrows
as
i
have
myself
observed
work
of
this
kind
is
usually
performed
during
the
night
but
i
have
occasionally
known
objects
to
be
drawn
into
the
burrows
during
the
day
what
advantage
the
worms
derive
from
plugging
up
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
with
leaves
or
from
piling
stones
over
them
is
doubtful
they
do
not
act
in
this
manner
at
the
times
when
they
eject
much
earth
from
their
burrows
for
their
castings
then
serve
to
cover
the
mouths
when
gardeners
wish
to
kill
worms
on
a
lawn
it
is
necessary
first
to
brush
or
rake
away
the
castings
from
the
surface
in
order
that
the
may
enter
the
burrows
it
might
be
inferred
from
this
fact
that
the
mouths
are
plugged
up
with
leaves
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
water
during
heavy
rain
but
it
may
be
urged
against
this
view
that
a
few
loose
stones
are
to
keep
out
water
i
have
moreover
seen
many
burrows
in
the
perpendicularly
cut
to
into
which
water
could
hardly
flow
as
well
plugged
as
burrows
on
a
level
surface
it
is
not
probable
that
the
plugs
or
piles
of
stones
serve
to
conceal
the
burrows
from
scolopendras
which
according
to
hoffmeister
are
the
bitterest
enemies
of
worms
or
from
the
larger
species
of
carabus
and
staphylinus
which
attack
them
ferociously
for
these
animals
are
nocturnal
and
the
burrows
are
opened
at
night
may
not
worms
when
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
is
protected
be
able
to
remain
with
safety
with
their
heads
close
to
it
which
we
know
that
they
like
to
do
but
which
costs
so
many
of
them
their
lives
or
may
not
the
plugs
check
the
free
ingress
of
the
lowest
stratum
of
air
when
chilled
by
radiation
at
night
from
the
surrounding
ground
and
herbage
i
am
inclined
to
believe
in
this
latter
view
firstly
because
when
worms
were
kept
in
pots
in
a
room
with
a
fire
in
which
case
cold
air
could
not
enter
the
burrows
they
plugged
them
up
in
a
slovenly
manner
and
secondarily
because
they
often
coat
the
upper
part
of
their
burrows
with
leaves
apparently
to
prevent
their
bodies
from
coming
into
close
contact
with
the
cold
damp
earth
parfitt
has
suggested
to
me
that
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
are
closed
in
order
that
the
air
within
them
may
be
kept
thoroughly
damp
and
this
seems
the
most
probable
explanation
of
the
habit
but
the
process
may
serve
for
all
the
above
purposes
whatever
the
motive
may
be
it
appears
that
worms
much
dislike
leaving
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
open
nevertheless
they
will
reopen
them
at
night
whether
or
not
they
can
afterwards
close
them
numerous
open
burrows
may
be
seen
on
ground
for
in
this
case
the
worms
eject
their
castings
in
cavities
left
in
the
ground
or
in
the
old
burrows
instead
of
piling
them
over
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
and
they
can
not
collect
objects
on
the
surface
by
which
the
mouths
might
be
protected
so
again
on
a
recently
disinterred
pavement
of
a
roman
villa
at
abinger
hereafter
to
be
described
the
worms
pertinaciously
opened
their
burrows
almost
every
night
when
these
had
been
closed
by
being
trampled
on
although
they
were
rarely
able
to
find
a
few
minute
stones
wherewith
to
protect
them
shown
by
worms
in
their
manner
of
plugging
up
their
a
man
had
to
plug
up
a
small
cylindrical
hole
with
such
objects
as
leaves
petioles
or
twigs
he
would
drag
or
push
them
in
by
their
pointed
ends
but
if
these
objects
were
very
thin
relatively
to
the
size
of
the
hole
he
would
probably
insert
some
by
their
thicker
or
broader
ends
the
guide
in
his
case
would
be
intelligence
it
seemed
therefore
worth
while
to
observe
carefully
how
worms
dragged
leaves
into
their
burrows
whether
by
their
tips
or
bases
or
middle
parts
it
seemed
more
especially
desirable
to
do
this
in
the
case
of
plants
not
natives
to
our
country
for
although
the
habit
of
dragging
leaves
into
their
burrows
is
undoubtedly
instinctive
with
worms
yet
instinct
could
not
tell
them
how
to
act
in
the
case
of
leaves
about
which
their
progenitors
knew
nothing
if
moreover
worms
acted
solely
through
instinct
or
an
unvarying
inherited
impulse
they
would
draw
all
kinds
of
leaves
into
their
burrows
in
the
same
manner
if
they
have
no
such
definite
instinct
we
might
expect
that
chance
would
determine
whether
the
tip
base
or
middle
was
seized
if
both
these
alternatives
are
excluded
intelligence
alone
is
left
unless
the
worm
in
each
case
first
tries
many
different
methods
and
follows
that
alone
which
proves
possible
or
the
most
easy
but
to
act
in
this
manner
and
to
try
different
methods
makes
a
near
approach
to
intelligence
in
the
first
place
withered
leaves
of
various
kinds
mostly
of
english
plants
were
pulled
out
of
in
several
places
of
these
had
been
drawn
into
the
burrows
by
or
near
their
tips
so
that
the
projected
nearly
upright
from
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
had
been
drawn
in
by
their
bases
and
in
this
case
the
tips
projected
from
the
burrows
and
had
been
seized
near
the
middle
so
that
these
had
been
drawn
in
transversely
and
were
much
crumpled
therefore
per
cent
always
using
the
nearest
whole
number
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
tip
per
cent
by
the
base
or
and
per
cent
transversely
or
by
the
middle
this
alone
is
almost
sufficient
to
show
that
chance
does
not
determine
the
manner
in
which
leaves
are
dragged
into
the
burrows
of
the
above
leaves
consisted
of
the
fallen
leaves
of
the
common
which
is
almost
certainly
not
a
native
of
england
these
leaves
are
much
acuminated
towards
the
tip
and
are
very
broad
at
the
base
with
a
they
are
thin
and
quite
flexible
when
of
the
per
cent
had
been
drawn
in
by
or
near
the
tip
per
cent
by
or
near
the
base
and
per
cent
transversely
or
by
the
middle
these
proportions
agree
very
closely
as
far
as
the
tip
is
concerned
with
those
before
given
but
the
percentage
drawn
in
by
the
base
is
smaller
which
may
be
attributed
to
the
breadth
of
the
basal
part
of
the
blade
we
here
also
see
that
the
presence
of
a
which
it
might
have
been
expected
would
have
tempted
the
worms
as
a
convenient
handle
has
little
or
no
influence
in
determining
the
manner
in
which
lime
leaves
are
dragged
into
the
burrows
the
considerable
proportion
per
drawn
in
more
or
less
transversely
depends
no
doubt
on
the
flexibility
of
these
leaves
the
fact
of
so
many
having
been
drawn
in
by
the
middle
and
of
some
few
having
been
drawn
in
by
the
base
renders
it
improbable
that
the
worms
first
tried
to
draw
in
most
of
the
leaves
by
one
or
both
of
these
methods
and
that
they
afterwards
drew
in
per
cent
by
their
tips
for
it
is
clear
that
they
would
not
have
failed
in
drawing
them
in
by
the
base
or
middle
the
leaves
of
a
foreign
plant
were
next
searched
for
the
blades
of
which
were
not
more
pointed
towards
the
apex
than
towards
the
base
this
proved
to
be
the
case
with
those
of
a
laburnum
a
hybrid
between
and
for
on
doubling
the
terminal
over
the
basal
half
they
generally
fitted
exactly
and
when
there
was
any
difference
the
basal
half
was
a
little
the
narrower
it
might
therefore
have
been
expected
that
an
almost
equal
number
of
these
leaves
would
have
been
drawn
in
by
the
tip
and
base
or
a
slight
excess
in
favour
of
the
latter
but
of
leaves
not
included
in
the
first
lot
of
pulled
out
of
per
cent
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
tip
per
cent
by
the
base
and
per
cent
transversely
we
here
see
that
a
far
larger
proportion
per
cent
were
drawn
in
by
the
base
than
in
the
case
of
lime
leaves
the
blades
of
which
are
very
broad
at
the
base
and
of
which
only
per
cent
had
thus
been
drawn
in
we
may
perhaps
account
for
the
fact
of
a
still
larger
proportion
of
the
laburnum
leaves
not
having
been
drawn
in
by
the
base
by
worms
having
acquired
the
habit
of
generally
drawing
in
leaves
by
their
tips
and
thus
avoiding
the
for
the
basal
margin
of
the
blade
in
many
kinds
of
leaves
forms
a
large
angle
with
the
and
if
such
a
leaf
were
drawn
in
by
the
the
basal
margin
would
come
abruptly
into
contact
with
the
ground
on
each
side
of
the
burrow
and
would
render
the
drawing
in
of
the
leaf
very
difficult
nevertheless
worms
break
through
their
habit
of
avoiding
the
if
this
part
offers
them
the
most
convenient
means
for
drawing
leaves
into
their
burrows
the
leaves
of
the
endless
hybridised
varieties
of
the
rhododendron
vary
much
in
shape
some
are
narrowest
towards
the
base
and
others
towards
the
apex
after
they
have
fallen
off
the
blade
on
each
side
of
the
midrib
often
becomes
curled
up
while
drying
sometimes
along
the
whole
length
sometimes
chiefly
at
the
base
sometimes
towards
the
apex
out
of
fallen
leaves
on
one
bed
of
peat
in
my
garden
no
less
than
were
narrower
in
the
basal
quarter
than
in
the
terminal
quarter
of
their
length
and
this
narrowness
was
chiefly
due
to
the
curling
in
of
the
margins
out
of
fallen
leaves
on
another
bed
in
which
different
varieties
of
the
rhododendron
grew
only
were
narrower
towards
the
base
than
towards
the
apex
my
son
william
who
first
called
my
attention
to
this
case
picked
up
fallen
leaves
in
his
garden
where
the
rhododendron
grows
in
the
natural
soil
and
of
these
per
cent
could
have
been
drawn
by
worms
into
their
burrows
more
easily
by
the
base
or
than
by
the
tip
and
this
was
partly
due
to
the
shape
of
the
leaf
and
in
a
less
degree
to
the
curling
in
of
the
margins
per
cent
could
have
been
drawn
in
more
easily
by
the
tip
than
by
the
base
and
per
cent
with
about
equal
ease
by
either
end
the
shape
of
a
fallen
leaf
ought
to
be
judged
of
before
one
end
has
been
drawn
into
a
burrow
for
after
this
has
happened
the
free
end
whether
it
be
the
base
or
apex
will
dry
more
quickly
than
the
end
imbedded
in
the
damp
ground
and
the
exposed
margins
of
the
free
end
will
consequently
tend
to
become
more
curled
inwards
than
they
were
when
the
leaf
was
first
seized
by
the
worm
my
son
found
leaves
which
had
been
dragged
by
worms
into
their
burrows
though
not
to
a
great
depth
of
these
per
cent
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
base
or
and
per
cent
by
the
tip
in
this
case
therefore
the
worms
judged
with
a
considerable
degree
of
correctness
how
best
to
draw
the
withered
leaves
of
this
foreign
plant
into
their
burrows
notwithstanding
that
they
had
to
depart
from
their
usual
habit
of
avoiding
the
on
the
in
my
garden
a
very
large
number
of
leaves
of
three
species
of
pinus
and
are
regularly
drawn
into
the
mouths
of
worm
burrows
these
leaves
consist
of
two
needles
which
are
of
considerable
length
in
the
two
first
and
short
in
the
last
named
species
and
are
united
to
a
common
base
and
it
is
by
this
part
that
they
are
almost
invariably
drawn
into
the
burrows
i
have
seen
only
two
or
at
most
three
exceptions
to
this
rule
with
worms
in
a
state
of
nature
as
the
sharply
pointed
needles
diverge
a
little
and
as
several
leaves
are
drawn
into
the
same
burrow
each
tuft
forms
a
perfect
de
on
two
occasions
many
of
these
tufts
were
pulled
up
in
the
evening
but
by
the
following
morning
fresh
leaves
had
been
pulled
in
and
the
burrows
were
again
well
protected
these
leaves
could
not
be
dragged
into
the
burrows
to
any
depth
except
by
their
bases
as
a
worm
can
not
seize
hold
of
the
two
needles
at
the
same
time
and
if
one
alone
were
seized
by
the
apex
the
other
would
be
pressed
against
the
ground
and
would
resist
the
entry
of
the
seized
one
this
was
manifest
in
the
above
mentioned
two
or
three
exceptional
cases
in
order
therefore
that
worms
should
do
their
work
well
they
must
drag
into
their
burrows
by
their
bases
where
the
two
needles
are
conjoined
but
how
they
are
guided
in
this
work
is
a
perplexing
question
this
difficulty
led
my
son
francis
and
myself
to
observe
worms
in
confinement
during
several
nights
by
the
aid
of
a
dim
light
while
they
dragged
the
leaves
of
the
above
named
pines
into
their
burrows
they
moved
the
anterior
extremities
of
their
bodies
about
the
leaves
and
on
several
occasions
when
they
touched
the
sharp
end
of
a
needle
they
withdrew
suddenly
as
if
pricked
but
i
doubt
whether
they
were
hurt
for
they
are
indifferent
to
very
sharp
objects
and
will
swallow
even
and
small
splinters
of
glass
it
may
also
be
doubted
whether
the
sharp
ends
of
the
needles
serve
to
tell
them
that
this
is
the
wrong
end
to
seize
for
the
points
were
cut
off
many
leaves
for
a
length
of
about
one
inch
and
of
them
thus
treated
were
drawn
into
the
burrows
by
their
bases
and
not
one
by
the
ends
the
worms
in
confinement
often
seized
the
needles
near
the
middle
and
drew
them
towards
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
and
one
worm
tried
in
a
senseless
manner
to
drag
them
into
the
burrow
by
bending
them
they
sometimes
collected
many
more
leaves
over
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
as
in
the
case
formerly
mentioned
of
than
could
enter
them
on
other
occasions
however
they
behaved
very
differently
for
as
soon
as
they
touched
the
base
of
a
this
was
seized
being
sometimes
completely
engulfed
in
their
mouths
or
a
point
very
near
the
base
was
seized
and
the
leaf
was
then
quickly
dragged
or
rather
jerked
into
their
burrows
it
appeared
both
to
my
son
and
myself
as
if
the
worms
instantly
perceived
as
soon
as
they
had
seized
a
leaf
in
the
proper
manner
nine
such
cases
were
observed
but
in
one
of
them
the
worm
failed
to
drag
the
leaf
into
its
burrow
as
it
was
entangled
by
other
leaves
lying
near
in
another
case
a
leaf
stood
nearly
upright
with
the
points
of
the
needles
partly
inserted
into
a
burrow
but
how
placed
there
was
not
seen
and
then
the
worm
reared
itself
up
and
seized
the
base
which
was
dragged
into
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
by
bowing
the
whole
leaf
on
the
other
hand
after
a
worm
had
seized
the
base
of
a
leaf
this
was
on
two
occasions
relinquished
from
some
unknown
motive
as
already
remarked
the
habit
of
plugging
up
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
with
various
objects
is
no
doubt
instinctive
in
worms
and
a
very
young
one
born
in
one
of
my
pots
dragged
for
some
little
distance
a
leaf
one
needle
of
which
was
as
long
and
almost
as
thick
as
its
own
body
no
species
of
pine
is
endemic
in
this
part
of
england
it
is
therefore
incredible
that
the
proper
manner
of
dragging
into
the
burrows
can
be
instinctive
with
our
worms
but
as
the
worms
on
which
the
above
observations
were
made
were
dug
up
beneath
or
near
some
pines
which
had
been
planted
there
about
forty
years
it
was
desirable
to
prove
that
their
actions
were
not
instinctive
accordingly
were
scattered
on
the
ground
in
places
far
removed
from
any
and
of
them
were
drawn
into
the
burrows
by
their
bases
only
two
were
drawn
in
by
the
tips
of
the
needles
and
these
were
not
real
exceptions
as
one
was
drawn
in
for
a
very
short
distance
and
the
two
needles
of
the
other
cohered
other
were
given
to
worms
kept
in
pots
in
a
warm
room
and
here
the
result
was
different
for
out
of
leaves
drawn
into
the
burrows
no
less
than
were
drawn
in
by
the
tips
of
the
needles
these
worms
however
worked
in
a
careless
or
slovenly
manner
for
the
leaves
were
often
drawn
in
to
only
a
small
depth
sometimes
they
were
merely
heaped
over
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
and
sometimes
none
were
drawn
in
i
believe
that
this
carelessness
may
be
accounted
for
either
by
the
warmth
of
the
air
or
by
its
dampness
as
the
pots
were
covered
by
glass
plates
the
worms
consequently
did
not
care
about
plugging
up
their
holes
effectually
pots
tenanted
by
worms
and
covered
with
a
net
which
allowed
the
free
entrance
of
air
were
left
out
of
doors
for
several
nights
and
now
leaves
were
all
properly
drawn
in
by
their
bases
it
might
perhaps
be
inferred
from
the
facts
as
yet
given
that
worms
somehow
gain
a
general
notion
of
the
shape
or
structure
of
and
perceive
that
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
seize
the
base
where
the
two
needles
are
conjoined
but
the
following
cases
make
this
more
than
doubtful
the
tips
of
a
large
number
of
needles
of
were
cemented
together
with
dissolved
in
alcohol
and
were
kept
for
some
days
until
as
i
believe
all
odour
or
taste
had
been
lost
and
they
were
then
scattered
on
the
ground
where
no
grew
near
burrows
from
which
the
plugging
had
been
removed
such
leaves
could
have
been
drawn
into
the
burrows
with
equal
ease
by
either
end
and
judging
from
analogy
and
more
especially
from
the
case
presently
to
be
given
of
the
petioles
of
i
expected
that
the
apex
would
have
been
preferred
but
the
result
was
that
out
of
leaves
with
the
tips
cemented
which
were
drawn
into
burrows
were
drawn
in
by
their
bases
and
only
by
their
tips
thinking
that
the
worms
might
possibly
perceive
and
dislike
the
smell
or
taste
of
the
though
this
was
very
improbable
especially
after
the
leaves
had
been
left
out
during
several
nights
the
tips
of
the
needles
of
many
leaves
were
tied
together
with
fine
thread
of
leaves
thus
treated
were
drawn
into
by
the
base
and
by
the
tied
tips
so
that
between
four
and
five
times
as
many
were
drawn
in
by
the
base
as
by
the
tip
it
is
possible
that
the
short
ends
of
the
thread
with
which
they
were
tied
may
have
tempted
the
worms
to
drag
in
a
larger
proportional
number
by
the
tips
than
when
cement
was
used
of
the
leaves
with
tied
and
cemented
tips
taken
together
in
number
per
cent
were
drawn
in
by
the
base
and
per
cent
by
the
tips
we
may
therefore
infer
that
it
is
not
the
divergence
of
the
two
needles
which
leads
worms
in
a
state
of
nature
almost
invariably
to
drag
into
their
burrows
by
the
base
nor
can
it
be
the
sharpness
of
the
points
of
the
needles
which
determines
them
for
as
we
have
seen
many
leaves
with
the
points
cut
off
were
drawn
in
by
their
bases
we
are
thus
led
to
conclude
that
with
there
must
be
something
attractive
to
worms
in
the
base
notwithstanding
that
few
ordinary
leaves
are
drawn
in
by
the
base
or
will
now
turn
to
the
petioles
or
of
compound
leaves
after
the
leaflets
have
fallen
off
those
from
which
grew
over
a
verandah
were
dragged
early
in
january
in
large
numbers
into
the
burrows
on
an
adjoining
lawn
and
these
petioles
vary
from
to
inches
in
length
are
rigid
and
of
nearly
uniform
thickness
except
close
to
the
base
where
they
thicken
rather
abruptly
being
here
about
twice
as
thick
as
in
any
other
part
the
apex
is
somewhat
pointed
but
soon
withers
and
is
then
easily
broken
off
of
these
petioles
were
pulled
out
of
burrows
in
the
above
specified
sites
and
it
was
found
that
per
cent
had
been
drawn
in
by
their
tips
and
per
cent
by
their
bases
so
that
those
drawn
in
by
the
tip
were
a
little
more
than
thrice
as
many
as
those
drawn
in
by
the
base
some
of
those
extracted
from
the
were
kept
separate
from
the
others
and
of
these
in
number
nearly
five
times
as
many
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
tip
as
by
the
base
whereas
of
those
extracted
from
the
lawn
and
where
from
the
soil
yielding
more
easily
less
care
would
be
necessary
in
plugging
up
the
burrows
the
proportion
of
those
drawn
in
by
the
tip
to
those
drawn
in
by
the
base
was
rather
less
than
three
to
one
that
these
petioles
had
been
dragged
into
the
burrows
for
plugging
them
up
and
not
for
food
was
manifest
as
neither
end
as
far
as
i
could
see
had
been
gnawed
as
several
petioles
are
used
to
plug
up
the
same
burrow
in
one
case
as
many
as
and
in
another
case
as
many
as
the
worms
may
perhaps
at
first
draw
in
a
few
by
the
thicker
end
so
as
to
save
labour
but
afterwards
a
large
majority
are
drawn
in
by
the
pointed
end
in
order
to
plug
up
the
hole
securely
the
fallen
petioles
of
our
native
were
next
observed
and
the
rule
with
most
objects
that
a
large
majority
are
dragged
into
the
burrows
by
the
more
pointed
end
had
not
here
been
followed
and
this
fact
much
surprised
me
at
first
these
petioles
vary
in
length
from
to
inches
they
are
thick
and
fleshy
towards
the
base
whence
they
taper
gently
towards
the
apex
which
is
a
little
enlarged
and
truncated
where
the
terminal
leaflet
had
been
originally
attached
under
some
growing
in
a
petioles
were
pulled
out
of
worm
burrows
early
in
january
and
of
these
per
cent
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
base
and
per
cent
by
the
apex
this
anomaly
was
however
readily
explained
as
soon
as
the
thick
basal
part
was
examined
for
in
out
of
petioles
this
part
had
been
gnawed
by
worms
just
above
the
shaped
articulation
in
most
cases
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
gnawing
for
ungnawed
petioles
which
were
examined
after
being
exposed
to
the
weather
for
eight
additional
weeks
had
not
become
more
disintegrated
or
decayed
near
the
base
than
elsewhere
it
is
thus
evident
that
the
thick
basal
end
of
the
petiole
is
drawn
in
not
solely
for
the
sake
of
plugging
up
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
but
as
food
even
the
narrow
truncated
tips
of
some
few
petioles
had
been
gnawed
and
this
was
the
case
in
out
of
which
were
examined
for
this
purpose
worms
after
having
drawn
in
and
gnawed
the
basal
end
often
push
the
petioles
out
of
their
burrows
and
then
drag
in
fresh
ones
either
by
the
base
for
food
or
by
the
apex
for
plugging
up
the
mouth
more
effectually
thus
out
of
petioles
inserted
by
their
tips
had
been
previously
drawn
in
by
the
base
for
this
part
had
been
gnawed
again
i
collected
a
handful
of
petioles
lying
loose
on
the
ground
close
to
some
burrows
where
the
surface
was
thickly
strewed
with
other
petioles
which
apparently
had
never
been
touched
by
worms
and
out
of
nearly
after
having
had
their
bases
gnawed
had
been
pushed
out
of
the
burrows
and
were
now
lying
on
the
ground
from
these
several
facts
we
may
conclude
that
worms
draw
in
some
petioles
of
the
ash
by
the
base
to
serve
as
food
and
others
by
the
tip
to
plug
up
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
in
the
most
efficient
manner
the
petioles
of
vary
from
or
to
nearly
inches
in
length
they
are
thick
close
to
the
base
before
the
softer
parts
have
rotted
off
and
taper
much
towards
the
upper
end
they
are
so
flexible
that
i
have
seen
some
few
doubled
up
and
thus
drawn
into
the
burrows
of
worms
unfortunately
these
petioles
were
not
examined
until
february
by
which
time
the
softer
parts
had
completely
rotted
off
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
ascertain
whether
worms
had
gnawed
the
bases
though
this
is
in
itself
probable
out
of
petioles
extracted
from
burrows
early
in
february
were
imbedded
by
the
base
and
by
the
apex
on
february
all
the
petioles
which
had
been
drawn
into
the
burrows
beneath
a
robinia
were
pulled
up
and
after
an
interval
of
eleven
days
petioles
had
been
again
dragged
in
by
the
base
and
by
the
apex
taking
these
two
lots
together
per
cent
were
drawn
in
by
the
base
and
per
cent
by
the
apex
as
all
the
softer
parts
had
long
ago
rotted
off
we
may
feel
sure
especially
in
the
latter
case
that
none
had
been
drawn
in
as
food
at
this
season
therefore
worms
drag
these
petioles
into
their
burrows
indifferently
by
either
end
a
slight
preference
being
given
to
the
base
this
latter
fact
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
difficulty
of
plugging
up
a
burrow
with
objects
so
extremely
thin
as
are
the
upper
ends
in
support
of
this
view
it
may
be
stated
that
out
of
the
petioles
which
had
been
drawn
in
by
their
upper
ends
the
more
attenuated
terminal
portion
of
had
been
previously
broken
off
by
some
accident
of
triangles
were
cut
out
of
moderately
stiff
which
was
rubbed
with
raw
fat
on
both
sides
so
as
to
prevent
their
becoming
excessively
limp
when
exposed
at
night
to
rain
and
dew
the
sides
of
all
the
triangles
were
three
inches
in
length
with
the
bases
of
one
inch
and
of
the
other
half
an
inch
in
length
these
latter
triangles
were
very
narrow
or
much
acuminated
as
a
check
on
the
observations
presently
to
be
given
similar
triangles
in
a
damp
state
were
seized
by
a
very
narrow
pair
of
pincers
at
different
points
and
at
all
inclinations
with
reference
to
the
margins
and
were
then
drawn
into
a
short
tube
of
the
diameter
of
a
if
seized
by
the
apex
the
triangle
was
drawn
straight
into
the
tube
with
its
margins
infolded
if
seized
at
some
little
distance
from
the
apex
for
instance
at
half
an
inch
this
much
was
doubled
back
within
the
tube
so
it
was
with
the
base
and
basal
angles
though
in
this
case
the
triangles
offered
as
might
have
been
expected
much
more
resistance
to
being
drawn
in
if
seized
near
the
middle
the
triangle
was
doubled
up
with
the
apex
and
base
left
sticking
out
of
the
tube
as
the
sides
of
the
triangles
were
three
inches
in
length
the
result
of
their
being
drawn
into
a
tube
or
into
a
burrow
in
different
ways
may
be
conveniently
divided
into
three
groups
those
drawn
in
by
the
apex
or
within
an
inch
of
it
those
drawn
in
by
the
base
or
within
an
inch
of
it
and
those
drawn
in
by
any
point
in
the
middle
inch
in
order
to
see
how
the
triangles
would
be
seized
by
worms
some
in
a
damp
state
were
given
to
worms
kept
in
confinement
they
were
seized
in
three
different
manners
in
the
case
of
both
the
narrow
and
broad
triangles
by
the
margin
by
one
of
the
three
angles
which
was
often
completely
engulfed
in
their
mouths
and
lastly
by
suction
applied
to
any
part
of
the
flat
surface
if
lines
parallel
to
the
base
and
an
inch
apart
are
drawn
across
a
triangle
with
the
sides
three
inches
in
length
it
will
be
divided
into
three
parts
of
equal
length
now
if
worms
seized
indifferently
by
chance
any
part
they
would
assuredly
seize
on
the
basal
part
or
division
far
oftener
than
on
either
of
the
two
other
divisions
for
the
area
of
the
basal
to
the
apical
part
is
as
to
so
that
the
chance
of
the
former
being
drawn
into
a
burrow
by
suction
will
be
as
to
compared
with
the
apical
part
the
base
offers
two
angles
and
the
apex
only
one
so
that
the
former
would
have
twice
as
good
a
chance
independently
of
the
size
of
the
angles
of
being
engulfed
in
a
worm
s
mouth
as
would
the
apex
it
should
however
be
stated
that
the
apical
angle
is
not
often
seized
by
worms
the
margin
at
a
little
distance
on
either
side
being
preferred
i
judge
of
this
from
having
found
in
out
of
cases
in
which
triangles
had
been
drawn
into
burrows
by
their
apical
ends
that
the
tip
had
been
doubled
back
within
the
burrow
for
a
length
of
between
of
an
inch
and
inch
lastly
the
proportion
between
the
margins
of
the
basal
and
apical
parts
is
as
to
for
the
broad
and
to
for
the
narrow
triangles
from
these
several
considerations
it
might
certainly
have
been
expected
supposing
that
worms
seized
hold
of
the
triangles
by
chance
that
a
considerably
larger
proportion
would
have
been
dragged
into
the
burrows
by
the
basal
than
by
the
apical
part
but
we
shall
immediately
see
how
different
was
the
result
triangles
of
the
above
specified
sizes
were
scattered
on
the
ground
in
many
places
and
on
many
successive
nights
near
from
which
the
leaves
petioles
twigs
with
which
they
had
been
plugged
were
removed
altogether
triangles
were
drawn
by
worms
into
their
burrows
others
were
drawn
in
by
both
ends
but
as
it
was
impossible
to
judge
by
which
end
they
had
been
first
seized
these
are
excluded
of
the
per
cent
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
apex
using
this
term
for
all
drawn
in
by
the
apical
part
one
inch
in
length
per
cent
by
the
middle
and
per
cent
by
the
basal
part
if
they
had
been
drawn
indifferently
by
any
point
the
proportion
for
the
apical
middle
and
basal
parts
would
have
been
per
cent
for
each
but
as
we
have
just
seen
it
might
have
been
expected
that
a
much
larger
proportion
would
have
been
drawn
in
by
the
basal
than
by
any
other
part
as
the
case
stands
nearly
three
times
as
many
were
drawn
in
by
the
apex
as
by
the
base
if
we
consider
the
broad
triangles
by
themselves
per
cent
were
drawn
in
by
the
apex
per
cent
by
the
middle
and
per
cent
by
the
base
of
the
narrow
triangles
per
cent
were
drawn
in
by
the
apex
per
cent
by
the
middle
and
per
cent
by
the
base
so
that
here
those
drawn
in
by
the
apex
were
more
than
times
as
many
as
those
drawn
in
by
the
base
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
the
manner
in
which
the
triangles
are
drawn
into
the
burrows
is
not
a
matter
of
chance
in
eight
cases
two
triangles
had
been
drawn
into
the
same
burrow
and
in
seven
of
these
cases
one
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
apex
and
the
other
by
the
base
this
again
indicates
that
the
result
is
not
determined
by
chance
worms
appear
sometimes
to
revolve
in
the
act
of
drawing
in
the
triangles
for
five
out
of
the
whole
lot
had
been
wound
into
an
irregular
spire
round
the
inside
of
the
burrow
worms
kept
in
a
warm
room
drew
triangles
into
their
burrows
but
as
in
the
case
of
the
they
worked
in
a
rather
careless
manner
for
only
per
cent
were
drawn
in
by
the
apex
per
cent
by
the
middle
and
per
cent
by
the
base
in
five
cases
two
triangles
were
drawn
into
the
same
burrow
it
may
be
suggested
with
much
apparent
probability
that
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
triangles
were
drawn
in
by
the
apex
not
from
the
worms
having
selected
this
end
as
the
most
convenient
for
the
purpose
but
from
having
first
tried
in
other
ways
and
failed
this
notion
was
countenanced
by
the
manner
in
which
worms
in
confinement
were
seen
to
drag
about
and
drop
the
triangles
but
then
they
were
working
carelessly
i
did
not
at
first
perceive
the
importance
of
this
subject
but
merely
noticed
that
the
bases
of
those
triangles
which
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
apex
were
generally
clean
and
not
crumpled
the
subject
was
afterwards
attended
to
carefully
in
the
first
place
several
triangles
which
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
basal
angles
or
by
the
base
or
a
little
above
the
base
and
which
were
thus
much
crumpled
and
dirtied
were
left
for
some
hours
in
water
and
were
then
well
shaken
while
immersed
but
neither
the
dirt
nor
the
creases
were
thus
removed
only
slight
creases
could
be
obliterated
even
by
pulling
the
wet
triangles
several
times
through
my
fingers
owing
to
the
slime
from
the
worms
bodies
the
dirt
was
not
easily
washed
off
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
if
a
triangle
before
being
dragged
in
by
the
apex
had
been
dragged
into
a
burrow
by
its
base
with
even
a
slight
degree
of
force
the
basal
part
would
long
retain
its
creases
and
remain
dirty
the
condition
of
triangles
narrow
and
broad
ones
which
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
apex
was
observed
and
the
bases
of
only
of
them
were
at
all
creased
being
at
the
same
time
generally
dirty
of
the
uncreased
triangles
were
dirty
at
the
base
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
fact
that
these
had
first
been
dragged
towards
the
burrows
by
their
bases
for
the
worms
sometimes
covered
large
portions
of
the
triangles
with
slime
and
these
when
dragged
by
the
apex
over
the
ground
would
be
dirtied
and
during
rainy
weather
the
triangles
were
often
dirtied
over
one
whole
side
or
over
both
sides
if
the
worms
had
dragged
the
triangles
to
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
by
their
bases
as
often
as
by
their
apices
and
had
then
perceived
without
actually
trying
to
draw
them
into
the
burrow
that
the
broader
end
was
not
well
adapted
for
this
in
this
case
a
large
proportion
would
probably
have
had
their
basal
ends
dirtied
we
may
therefore
as
is
the
worms
are
able
by
some
means
to
judge
which
is
the
best
end
by
which
to
draw
triangles
of
paper
into
their
burrows
the
percentage
results
of
the
foregoing
observations
on
the
manner
in
which
worms
draw
various
kinds
of
objects
into
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
may
be
abridged
as
follows
nature
of
drawn
into
the
drawn
in
by
or
drawn
in
by
or
object
burrows
by
or
near
the
near
the
base
near
the
apex
middle
leaves
of
various
kinds
the
lime
basal
margin
of
blade
broad
apex
acuminated
a
laburnum
basal
part
of
blade
as
narrow
as
or
sometimes
little
narrower
than
the
apical
part
the
rhododendron
basal
part
of
blade
often
narrower
than
the
apical
part
consisting
of
two
needles
arising
from
a
common
base
petioles
of
a
clematis
somewhat
pointed
at
the
apex
and
blunt
at
the
base
the
ash
the
thick
basal
end
often
drawn
in
to
serve
as
food
robinia
extremely
thin
especially
towards
the
apex
so
as
to
be
for
plugging
up
the
burrows
triangles
of
paper
of
the
two
sizes
the
broad
ones
alone
the
narrow
ones
alone
if
we
consider
these
several
cases
we
can
hardly
escape
from
the
conclusion
that
worms
show
some
degree
of
intelligence
in
their
manner
of
plugging
up
their
burrows
each
particular
object
is
seized
in
too
uniform
a
manner
and
from
causes
which
we
can
generally
understand
for
the
result
to
be
attributed
to
mere
chance
that
every
object
has
not
been
drawn
in
by
its
pointed
end
may
be
accounted
for
by
labour
having
been
saved
through
some
being
inserted
by
their
broader
or
thicker
ends
no
doubt
worms
are
led
by
instinct
to
plug
up
their
burrows
and
it
might
have
been
expected
that
they
would
have
been
led
by
instinct
how
best
to
act
in
each
particular
case
independently
of
intelligence
we
see
how
difficult
it
is
to
judge
whether
intelligence
comes
into
play
for
even
plants
might
sometimes
be
thought
to
be
thus
directed
for
instance
when
displaced
leaves
their
upper
surfaces
towards
the
light
by
extremely
complicated
movements
and
by
the
shortest
course
with
animals
actions
appearing
due
to
intelligence
may
be
performed
through
inherited
habit
without
any
intelligence
although
aboriginally
thus
acquired
or
the
habit
may
have
been
acquired
through
the
preservation
and
inheritance
of
beneficial
variations
of
some
other
habit
and
in
this
case
the
new
habit
will
have
been
acquired
independently
of
intelligence
throughout
the
whole
course
of
its
development
there
is
no
improbability
in
worms
having
acquired
special
instincts
through
either
of
these
two
latter
means
nevertheless
it
is
incredible
that
instincts
should
have
been
developed
in
reference
to
objects
such
as
the
leaves
of
petioles
of
foreign
plants
wholly
unknown
to
the
progenitors
of
the
worms
which
act
in
the
described
manner
nor
are
their
actions
so
unvarying
or
inevitable
as
are
most
true
instincts
as
worms
are
not
guided
by
special
instincts
in
each
particular
case
though
possessing
a
general
instinct
to
plug
up
their
burrows
and
as
chance
is
excluded
the
next
most
probable
conclusion
seems
to
be
that
they
try
in
many
different
ways
to
draw
in
objects
and
at
last
succeed
in
some
one
way
but
it
is
surprising
that
an
animal
so
low
in
the
scale
as
a
worm
should
have
the
capacity
for
acting
in
this
manner
as
many
higher
animals
have
no
such
capacity
for
instance
ants
may
be
seen
vainly
trying
to
drag
an
object
transversely
to
their
course
which
could
be
easily
drawn
longitudinally
though
after
a
time
they
generally
act
in
a
wiser
manner
fabre
states
that
a
insect
belonging
to
the
same
order
with
its
nest
with
paralysed
which
are
invariably
dragged
into
the
burrow
by
their
antennæ
when
these
were
cut
off
close
to
the
head
the
sphex
seized
the
palpi
but
when
these
were
likewise
cut
off
the
attempt
to
drag
its
prey
into
the
burrow
was
given
up
in
despair
the
sphex
had
not
intelligence
enough
to
seize
one
of
the
six
legs
or
the
ovipositor
of
the
grasshopper
which
as
fabre
remarks
would
have
served
equally
well
so
again
if
the
paralysed
prey
with
an
egg
attached
to
it
be
taken
out
of
the
cell
the
sphex
after
entering
and
finding
the
cell
empty
nevertheless
closes
it
up
in
the
usual
elaborate
manner
bees
will
try
to
escape
and
go
on
buzzing
for
hours
on
a
window
one
half
of
which
has
been
left
open
even
a
pike
continued
during
three
months
to
dash
and
bruise
itself
against
the
glass
sides
of
an
aquarium
in
the
vain
attempt
to
seize
minnows
on
the
opposite
side
a
was
seen
by
layard
to
act
much
more
wisely
than
either
the
pike
or
the
sphex
it
had
swallowed
a
toad
lying
within
a
hole
and
could
not
withdraw
its
head
the
toad
was
disgorged
and
began
to
crawl
away
it
was
again
swallowed
and
again
disgorged
and
now
the
snake
had
learnt
by
experience
for
it
seized
the
toad
by
one
of
its
legs
and
drew
it
out
of
the
hole
the
instincts
of
even
the
higher
animals
are
often
followed
in
a
senseless
or
purposeless
manner
the
will
perseveringly
wind
threads
through
the
bars
of
its
cage
as
if
building
a
nest
a
squirrel
will
pat
nuts
on
a
wooden
floor
as
if
he
had
just
buried
them
in
the
ground
a
beaver
will
cut
up
logs
of
wood
and
drag
them
about
though
there
is
no
water
to
dam
up
and
so
in
many
other
cases
romanes
who
has
specially
studied
the
minds
of
animals
believes
that
we
can
safely
infer
intelligence
only
when
we
see
an
individual
profiting
by
its
own
experience
by
this
test
the
cobra
showed
some
intelligence
but
this
would
have
been
much
plainer
if
on
a
second
occasion
he
had
drawn
a
toad
out
of
a
hole
by
its
leg
the
sphex
failed
signally
in
this
respect
now
if
worms
try
to
drag
objects
into
their
burrows
first
in
one
way
and
then
in
another
until
they
at
last
succeed
they
profit
at
least
in
each
particular
instance
by
experience
but
evidence
has
been
advanced
showing
that
worms
do
not
habitually
try
to
draw
objects
into
their
burrows
in
many
different
ways
thus
from
their
flexibility
could
have
been
drawn
in
by
their
middle
or
basal
parts
and
were
thus
drawn
into
the
burrows
in
considerable
numbers
yet
a
large
majority
were
drawn
in
by
or
near
the
apex
the
petioles
of
the
clematis
could
certainly
have
been
drawn
in
with
equal
ease
by
the
base
and
apex
yet
three
times
and
in
certain
cases
five
times
as
many
were
drawn
in
by
the
apex
as
by
the
base
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
of
leaves
would
have
tempted
the
worms
as
a
convenient
handle
yet
they
are
not
largely
used
except
when
the
base
of
the
blade
is
narrower
than
the
apex
a
large
number
of
the
petioles
of
the
ash
are
drawn
in
by
the
base
but
this
part
serves
the
worms
as
food
in
the
case
of
worms
plainly
show
that
they
at
least
do
not
seize
the
leaf
by
chance
but
their
choice
does
not
appear
to
be
determined
by
the
divergence
of
the
two
needles
and
the
consequent
advantage
or
necessity
of
drawing
them
into
their
burrows
by
the
base
with
respect
to
the
triangles
of
paper
those
which
had
been
drawn
in
by
the
apex
rarely
had
their
bases
creased
or
dirty
and
this
shows
that
the
worms
had
not
often
first
tried
to
drag
them
in
by
this
end
if
worms
are
able
to
judge
either
before
drawing
or
after
having
drawn
an
object
close
to
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
how
best
to
drag
it
in
they
must
acquire
some
notion
of
its
general
shape
this
they
probably
acquire
by
touching
it
in
many
places
with
the
anterior
extremity
of
their
bodies
which
serves
as
a
tactile
organ
it
may
be
well
to
remember
how
perfect
the
sense
of
touch
becomes
in
a
man
when
born
blind
and
deaf
as
are
worms
if
worms
have
the
power
of
acquiring
some
notion
however
rude
of
the
shape
of
an
object
and
of
their
burrows
as
seems
to
be
the
case
they
deserve
to
be
called
intelligent
for
they
then
act
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
would
a
man
under
similar
circumstances
to
sum
up
as
chance
does
not
determine
the
manner
in
which
objects
are
drawn
into
the
burrows
and
as
the
existence
of
specialized
instincts
for
each
particular
case
can
not
be
admitted
the
first
and
most
natural
supposition
is
that
worms
try
all
methods
until
they
at
last
succeed
but
many
appearances
are
opposed
to
such
a
supposition
one
alternative
alone
is
left
namely
that
worms
although
standing
low
in
the
scale
of
organization
possess
some
degree
of
intelligence
this
will
strike
every
one
as
very
improbable
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
we
know
enough
about
the
nervous
system
of
the
lower
animals
to
justify
our
natural
distrust
of
such
a
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
small
size
of
the
cerebral
ganglia
we
should
remember
what
a
mass
of
inherited
knowledge
with
some
power
of
adapting
means
to
an
end
is
crowded
into
the
minute
brain
of
a
by
which
worms
excavate
their
is
effected
in
two
ways
by
pushing
away
the
earth
on
all
sides
and
by
swallowing
it
in
the
former
case
the
worm
inserts
the
stretched
out
and
attenuated
anterior
extremity
of
its
body
into
any
little
crevice
or
hole
and
then
as
perrier
remarks
the
pharynx
is
pushed
forwards
into
this
part
which
consequently
swells
and
pushes
away
the
earth
on
all
sides
the
anterior
extremity
thus
serves
as
a
wedge
it
also
serves
as
we
have
before
seen
for
prehension
and
suction
and
as
a
tactile
organ
a
worm
was
placed
on
loose
mould
and
it
buried
itself
in
between
two
and
three
minutes
on
another
occasion
four
worms
disappeared
in
minutes
between
the
sides
of
the
pot
and
the
earth
which
had
been
moderately
pressed
down
on
a
third
occasion
three
large
worms
and
a
small
one
were
placed
on
loose
mould
well
mixed
with
fine
sand
and
firmly
pressed
down
and
they
all
disappeared
except
the
tail
of
one
in
minutes
on
a
fourth
occasion
six
large
worms
were
placed
on
argillaceous
mud
mixed
with
sand
firmly
pressed
down
and
they
disappeared
except
the
extreme
tips
of
the
tails
of
two
of
them
in
minutes
in
none
of
these
cases
did
the
worms
swallow
as
far
as
could
be
seen
any
earth
they
generally
entered
the
ground
close
to
the
sides
of
the
pot
a
pot
was
next
filled
with
very
fine
ferruginous
sand
which
was
pressed
down
well
watered
and
thus
rendered
extremely
compact
a
large
worm
left
on
the
surface
did
not
succeed
in
penetrating
it
for
some
hours
and
did
not
bury
itself
completely
until
hrs
min
had
elapsed
this
was
effected
by
the
sand
being
swallowed
as
was
evident
by
the
large
quantity
ejected
from
the
vent
long
before
the
whole
body
had
disappeared
castings
of
a
similar
nature
continued
to
be
ejected
from
the
burrow
during
the
whole
of
the
following
day
as
doubts
have
been
expressed
by
some
writers
whether
worms
ever
swallow
earth
solely
for
the
sake
of
making
their
burrows
some
additional
cases
may
be
given
a
mass
of
fine
reddish
sand
inches
in
thickness
left
on
the
ground
for
nearly
two
years
had
been
penetrated
in
many
places
by
worms
and
their
castings
consisted
partly
of
the
reddish
sand
and
partly
of
black
earth
brought
up
from
beneath
the
mass
this
sand
had
been
dug
up
from
a
considerable
depth
and
was
of
so
poor
a
nature
that
weeds
could
not
grow
on
it
it
is
therefore
highly
improbable
that
it
should
have
been
swallowed
by
the
worms
as
food
again
in
a
field
near
my
house
the
castings
frequently
consist
of
almost
pure
chalk
which
lies
at
only
a
little
depth
beneath
the
surface
and
here
again
it
is
very
improbable
that
the
chalk
should
have
been
swallowed
for
the
sake
of
the
very
little
organic
matter
which
could
have
percolated
into
it
from
the
poor
overlying
pasture
lastly
a
casting
thrown
up
through
the
concrete
and
decayed
mortar
between
the
tiles
with
which
the
now
ruined
aisle
of
beaulieu
abbey
had
formerly
been
paved
was
washed
so
that
the
coarser
matter
alone
was
left
this
consisted
of
grains
of
quartz
micaceous
slate
other
rocks
and
bricks
or
tiles
many
of
them
from
to
inch
in
diameter
no
one
will
suppose
that
these
grains
were
swallowed
as
food
yet
they
formed
more
than
half
of
the
casting
for
they
weighed
grains
the
whole
casting
having
weighed
grains
whenever
a
worm
burrows
to
a
depth
of
some
feet
in
undisturbed
compact
ground
it
must
form
its
passage
by
swallowing
the
earth
for
it
is
incredible
that
the
ground
could
yield
on
all
sides
to
the
pressure
of
the
pharynx
when
pushed
forwards
within
the
worm
s
body
that
worms
swallow
a
larger
quantity
of
earth
for
the
sake
of
extracting
any
nutritious
matter
which
it
may
contain
than
for
making
their
burrows
appears
to
me
certain
but
as
this
old
belief
has
been
doubted
by
so
high
an
authority
as
claparède
evidence
in
its
favour
must
be
given
in
some
detail
there
is
no
improbability
in
such
a
belief
for
besides
other
annelids
especially
the
which
throws
up
such
a
profusion
of
castings
on
our
tidal
sands
and
which
it
is
believed
thus
subsists
there
are
animals
belonging
to
the
most
distinct
classes
which
do
not
burrow
but
habitually
swallow
large
quantities
of
sand
namely
the
molluscan
onchidium
and
many
echinoderms
if
earth
were
swallowed
only
when
worms
deepened
their
burrows
or
made
new
ones
castings
would
be
thrown
up
only
occasionally
but
in
many
places
fresh
castings
may
be
seen
every
morning
and
the
amount
of
earth
ejected
from
the
same
burrow
on
successive
days
is
large
yet
worms
do
not
burrow
to
a
great
depth
except
when
the
weather
is
very
dry
or
intensely
cold
on
my
lawn
the
black
vegetable
mould
or
humus
is
only
about
inches
in
thickness
and
overlies
or
reddish
clayey
soil
now
when
castings
are
thrown
up
in
the
greatest
profusion
only
a
small
proportion
are
light
coloured
and
it
is
incredible
that
the
worms
should
daily
make
fresh
burrows
in
every
direction
in
the
thin
superficial
layer
of
mould
unless
they
obtained
nutriment
of
some
kind
from
it
i
have
observed
a
strictly
analogous
case
in
a
field
near
my
house
where
bright
red
clay
lay
close
beneath
the
surface
again
on
one
part
of
the
downs
near
winchester
the
vegetable
mould
overlying
the
chalk
was
found
to
be
only
from
to
inches
in
thickness
and
the
many
castings
here
ejected
were
as
black
as
ink
and
did
not
effervesce
with
acids
so
that
the
worms
must
have
confined
themselves
to
this
thin
superficial
layer
of
mould
of
which
large
quantities
were
daily
swallowed
in
another
place
at
no
great
distance
the
castings
were
white
and
why
the
worms
should
have
burrowed
into
the
chalk
in
some
places
and
not
in
others
i
am
unable
to
conjecture
two
great
piles
of
leaves
had
been
left
to
decay
in
my
grounds
and
months
after
their
removal
the
bare
surface
several
yards
in
diameter
was
so
thickly
covered
during
several
months
with
castings
that
they
formed
an
almost
continuous
layer
and
the
large
number
of
worms
which
lived
here
must
have
subsisted
during
these
months
on
nutritious
matter
contained
in
the
black
earth
the
lowest
layer
from
another
pile
of
decayed
leaves
mixed
with
some
earth
was
examined
under
a
high
power
and
the
number
of
spores
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
which
it
contained
was
astonishingly
great
and
these
crushed
in
the
gizzards
of
worms
may
largely
aid
in
supporting
them
whenever
castings
are
thrown
up
in
the
greatest
number
few
or
no
leaves
are
drawn
into
the
burrows
for
instance
the
turf
along
a
hedgerow
about
yards
in
length
was
daily
observed
in
the
autumn
during
several
weeks
and
every
morning
many
fresh
castings
were
seen
but
not
a
single
leaf
was
drawn
into
these
burrows
these
castings
from
their
blackness
and
from
the
nature
of
the
subsoil
could
not
have
been
brought
up
from
a
greater
depth
than
or
inches
on
what
could
these
worms
have
subsisted
during
this
whole
time
if
not
on
matter
contained
in
the
black
earth
on
the
other
hand
whenever
a
large
number
of
leaves
are
drawn
into
the
burrows
the
worms
seem
to
subsist
chiefly
on
them
for
few
are
then
ejected
on
the
surface
this
difference
in
the
behaviour
of
worms
at
different
times
perhaps
explains
a
statement
by
claparède
namely
that
triturated
leaves
and
earth
are
always
found
in
distinct
parts
of
their
intestines
worms
sometimes
abound
in
places
where
they
can
rarely
or
never
obtain
dead
or
living
leaves
for
instance
beneath
the
pavement
in
courtyards
into
which
leaves
are
only
occasionally
blown
my
son
horace
examined
a
house
one
corner
of
which
had
subsided
and
he
found
here
in
the
cellar
which
was
extremely
damp
many
small
thrown
up
between
the
stones
with
which
the
cellar
was
paved
and
in
this
case
it
is
improbable
that
the
worms
could
ever
have
obtained
leaves
horner
confirms
this
account
as
he
has
seen
castings
in
the
cellars
of
his
house
which
is
an
old
one
at
tonbridge
but
the
best
evidence
known
to
me
of
worms
subsisting
for
at
least
considerable
periods
of
time
solely
on
the
organic
matter
contained
in
earth
is
afforded
by
some
facts
communicated
to
me
by
king
near
nice
large
castings
abound
in
extraordinary
numbers
so
that
or
were
often
found
within
the
space
of
a
square
foot
they
consist
of
fine
earth
containing
calcareous
matter
which
after
having
passed
through
the
bodies
of
worms
and
being
dried
coheres
with
considerable
force
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
these
castings
had
been
formed
by
species
of
perichæta
which
have
been
naturalized
here
from
the
east
they
rise
like
towers
with
their
summits
often
a
little
broader
than
their
bases
sometimes
to
a
height
of
above
and
often
to
a
height
of
inches
the
tallest
of
those
which
were
measured
was
inches
in
height
and
inch
in
diameter
a
small
cylindrical
passage
runs
up
the
centre
of
each
tower
through
which
the
worm
ascends
to
eject
the
earth
which
it
has
swallowed
and
thus
to
add
to
its
height
a
structure
of
this
kind
would
not
allow
leaves
being
easily
dragged
from
the
surrounding
ground
into
the
burrows
and
king
who
looked
carefully
never
saw
even
a
fragment
of
a
leaf
thus
drawn
in
nor
could
any
trace
be
discovered
of
the
worms
having
crawled
down
the
exterior
surfaces
of
the
towers
in
search
of
leaves
and
had
they
done
so
tracks
would
almost
certainly
have
been
left
on
the
upper
part
whilst
it
remained
soft
it
does
not
however
follow
that
these
worms
do
not
draw
leaves
into
their
burrows
during
some
other
season
of
the
year
at
which
time
they
would
not
build
up
their
towers
from
the
several
foregoing
cases
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
worms
swallow
earth
not
only
for
the
sake
of
making
their
burrows
but
for
obtaining
food
hensen
however
concludes
from
his
analyses
of
mould
that
worms
probably
could
not
live
on
ordinary
vegetable
mould
though
he
admits
that
they
might
be
nourished
to
some
extent
by
but
we
have
seen
that
worms
eagerly
devour
raw
meat
fat
and
dead
worms
and
ordinary
mould
can
hardly
fail
to
contain
many
ova
larvæ
and
small
living
or
dead
creatures
spores
of
cryptogamic
plants
and
micrococci
such
as
those
which
give
rise
to
saltpetre
these
various
organisms
together
with
some
cellulose
from
any
leaves
and
roots
not
utterly
decayed
might
well
account
for
such
large
quantities
of
mould
being
swallowed
by
worms
it
may
be
worth
while
here
to
recall
the
fact
that
certain
species
of
utricularia
which
grow
in
damp
places
in
the
tropics
possess
bladders
beautifully
constructed
for
catching
minute
subterranean
animals
and
these
traps
would
not
have
been
developed
unless
many
small
animals
inhabited
such
soil
depth
to
which
worms
the
construction
of
their
worms
usually
live
near
the
surface
yet
they
burrow
to
a
considerable
depth
during
dry
weather
and
severe
cold
in
scandinavia
according
to
eisen
and
in
scotland
according
to
lindsay
carnagie
the
burrows
run
down
to
a
depth
of
from
to
feet
in
north
germany
according
to
hoffmeister
from
to
feet
but
hensen
says
from
to
feet
this
latter
observer
has
seen
worms
frozen
at
a
depth
of
feet
beneath
the
surface
i
have
not
myself
had
many
opportunities
for
observation
but
i
have
often
met
with
worms
at
depths
of
to
feet
in
a
bed
of
fine
sand
overlying
the
chalk
which
had
never
been
disturbed
a
worm
was
cut
into
two
at
inches
and
another
was
found
here
at
down
in
december
at
the
bottom
of
its
burrow
at
inches
beneath
the
surface
lastly
in
earth
near
an
old
roman
villa
which
had
not
been
disturbed
for
many
centuries
a
worm
was
met
with
at
a
depth
of
inches
and
this
was
in
the
middle
of
august
the
burrows
run
down
perpendicularly
or
more
commonly
a
little
obliquely
they
are
said
sometimes
to
branch
but
as
far
as
i
have
seen
this
does
not
occur
except
in
recently
dug
ground
and
near
the
surface
they
are
generally
or
as
i
believe
invariably
lined
with
a
thin
layer
of
fine
earth
voided
by
the
worms
so
that
they
must
at
first
be
made
a
little
wider
than
their
ultimate
diameter
i
have
seen
several
burrows
in
undisturbed
sand
thus
lined
at
a
depth
of
in
and
others
close
to
the
surface
thus
lined
in
recently
dug
ground
the
walls
of
fresh
burrows
are
often
dotted
with
little
globular
pellets
of
voided
earth
still
soft
and
viscid
and
these
as
it
appears
are
spread
out
on
all
sides
by
the
worm
as
it
travels
up
or
down
its
burrow
the
lining
thus
formed
becomes
very
compact
and
smooth
when
nearly
dry
and
closely
fits
the
worm
s
body
the
minute
reflexed
bristles
which
project
in
rows
on
all
sides
from
the
body
thus
have
excellent
points
of
support
and
the
burrow
is
rendered
well
adapted
for
the
rapid
movement
of
the
animal
the
lining
appears
also
to
strengthen
the
walls
and
perhaps
saves
the
worm
s
body
from
being
scratched
i
think
so
because
several
burrows
which
passed
through
a
layer
of
sifted
spread
over
turf
to
a
thickness
of
inch
had
been
thus
lined
to
an
unusual
thickness
in
this
case
the
worms
judging
from
the
castings
had
pushed
the
cinders
away
on
all
sides
and
had
not
swallowed
any
of
them
in
another
place
burrows
similarly
lined
passed
through
a
layer
of
coarse
inches
in
thickness
we
thus
see
that
the
burrows
are
not
mere
excavations
but
may
rather
be
compared
with
tunnels
lined
with
cement
the
mouths
of
the
burrow
are
in
addition
often
lined
with
leaves
and
this
is
an
instinct
distinct
from
that
of
plugging
them
up
and
does
not
appear
to
have
been
hitherto
noticed
many
leaves
of
the
or
pine
were
given
to
worms
kept
in
confinement
in
two
pots
and
when
after
several
weeks
the
earth
was
carefully
broken
up
the
upper
parts
of
three
oblique
burrows
were
found
surrounded
for
lengths
of
and
inches
with
together
with
fragments
of
other
leaves
which
had
been
given
the
worms
as
food
glass
beads
and
bits
of
tile
which
had
been
strewed
on
the
surface
of
the
soil
were
stuck
into
the
interstices
between
the
and
these
interstices
were
likewise
plastered
with
the
viscid
castings
voided
by
the
worms
the
structures
thus
formed
cohered
so
well
that
i
succeeded
in
removing
one
with
only
a
little
earth
adhering
to
it
it
consisted
of
a
slightly
curved
cylindrical
case
the
interior
of
which
could
be
seen
through
holes
in
the
sides
and
at
either
end
the
had
all
been
drawn
in
by
their
bases
and
the
sharp
points
of
the
needles
had
been
pressed
into
the
lining
of
voided
earth
had
this
not
been
effectually
done
the
sharp
points
would
have
prevented
the
retreat
of
the
worms
into
their
burrows
and
these
structures
would
have
resembled
traps
armed
with
converging
points
of
wire
rendering
the
ingress
of
an
animal
easy
and
its
egress
difficult
or
impossible
the
skill
shown
by
these
worms
is
noteworthy
and
is
the
more
remarkable
as
the
scotch
pine
is
not
a
native
of
this
district
after
having
examined
these
burrows
made
by
worms
in
confinement
i
looked
at
those
in
a
near
some
scotch
pines
these
had
all
been
plugged
up
in
the
ordinary
manner
with
the
leaves
of
this
tree
drawn
in
for
a
length
of
from
to
inch
but
the
mouths
of
many
of
them
were
likewise
lined
with
them
mingled
with
fragments
of
other
kinds
of
leaves
drawn
in
to
a
depth
of
or
inches
worms
often
remain
as
formerly
stated
for
a
long
time
close
to
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
apparently
for
warmth
and
the
structures
formed
of
leaves
would
keep
their
bodies
from
coming
into
close
contact
with
the
cold
damp
earth
that
they
habitually
rested
on
the
was
rendered
probable
by
their
clean
and
almost
polished
surfaces
the
burrows
which
run
far
down
into
the
ground
generally
or
at
least
often
terminate
in
a
little
enlargement
or
chamber
here
according
to
hoffmeister
one
or
several
worms
pass
the
winter
rolled
up
into
a
ball
lindsay
carnagie
informed
me
that
he
had
examined
many
burrows
over
a
in
scotland
where
the
overlying
and
mould
had
recently
been
cleared
away
and
a
little
vertical
cliff
thus
left
in
several
cases
the
same
burrow
was
a
little
enlarged
at
two
or
three
points
one
beneath
the
other
and
all
the
burrows
terminated
in
a
rather
large
chamber
at
a
depth
of
or
feet
from
the
surface
these
chambers
contained
many
small
sharp
bits
of
stone
and
husks
of
they
must
also
have
contained
living
seeds
for
on
the
following
spring
carnagie
saw
sprouting
out
of
some
of
the
intersected
chambers
i
found
at
abinger
in
surrey
two
burrows
terminating
in
similar
chambers
at
a
depth
of
and
inches
and
these
were
lined
or
paved
with
little
pebbles
about
as
large
as
mustard
seeds
and
in
one
of
the
chambers
there
was
a
decayed
with
its
husk
hensen
likewise
states
that
the
bottoms
of
the
burrows
are
lined
with
little
stones
and
where
these
could
not
be
procured
seeds
apparently
of
the
pear
had
been
used
as
many
as
fifteen
having
been
carried
down
into
a
single
burrow
one
of
which
had
germinated
we
thus
see
how
easily
a
botanist
might
be
deceived
who
wished
to
learn
how
long
deeply
buried
seeds
remained
alive
if
he
were
to
collect
earth
from
a
considerable
depth
on
the
supposition
that
it
could
contain
only
seeds
which
had
long
lain
buried
it
is
probable
that
the
little
stones
as
well
as
the
seeds
are
carried
down
from
the
surface
by
being
swallowed
for
a
surprising
number
of
glass
beads
bits
of
tile
and
of
glass
were
certainly
thus
carried
down
by
worms
kept
in
pots
but
some
may
have
been
carried
down
within
their
mouths
the
sole
conjecture
which
i
can
form
why
worms
line
their
with
little
stones
and
seeds
is
to
prevent
their
closely
bodies
from
coming
into
close
contact
with
the
surrounding
cold
soil
and
such
contact
would
perhaps
interfere
with
their
respiration
which
is
effected
by
the
skin
alone
a
worm
after
swallowing
earth
whether
for
making
its
burrow
or
for
food
soon
comes
to
the
surface
to
empty
its
body
the
ejected
earth
is
thoroughly
mingled
with
the
intestinal
secretions
and
is
thus
rendered
viscid
after
being
dried
it
sets
hard
i
have
watched
worms
during
the
act
of
ejection
and
when
the
earth
was
in
a
very
liquid
state
it
was
ejected
in
little
spurts
and
by
a
slow
peristaltic
movement
when
not
so
liquid
it
is
not
cast
indifferently
on
any
side
but
with
some
care
first
on
one
and
then
on
another
side
the
tail
being
used
almost
like
a
trowel
when
a
worm
comes
to
the
surface
to
eject
earth
the
tail
protrudes
but
when
it
collects
leaves
its
head
must
protrude
worms
therefore
must
have
the
power
of
turning
round
in
their
burrows
and
this
as
it
appears
to
us
would
be
a
difficult
feat
as
soon
as
a
little
heap
has
been
formed
the
worm
apparently
avoids
for
the
sake
of
safety
protruding
its
tail
and
the
earthy
matter
is
forced
up
through
the
previously
deposited
soft
mass
the
mouth
of
the
same
burrow
is
used
for
this
purpose
for
a
considerable
time
in
the
case
of
the
castings
see
fig
near
nice
and
of
the
similar
but
still
taller
towers
from
bengal
hereafter
to
be
described
and
figured
a
considerable
degree
of
skill
is
exhibited
in
their
construction
king
also
observed
that
the
passage
up
these
towers
hardly
ever
ran
in
the
same
exact
line
with
the
underlying
burrow
so
that
a
thin
cylindrical
object
such
as
a
haulm
of
grass
could
not
be
passed
down
the
tower
into
the
burrow
and
this
change
of
direction
probably
serves
in
some
manner
as
a
protection
worms
do
not
always
eject
their
castings
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
when
they
can
find
any
cavity
as
when
burrowing
in
newly
earth
or
between
the
stems
of
plants
they
deposit
their
castings
in
such
places
so
again
any
hollow
beneath
a
large
stone
lying
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
is
soon
filled
up
with
their
castings
according
to
hensen
old
burrows
are
habitually
used
for
this
purpose
but
as
far
as
my
experience
serves
this
is
not
the
case
excepting
with
those
near
the
surface
in
recently
dug
ground
i
think
that
hensen
may
have
been
deceived
by
the
walls
of
old
burrows
lined
with
black
earth
having
sunk
in
or
collapsed
for
black
streaks
are
thus
left
and
these
are
conspicuous
when
passing
through
soil
and
might
be
mistaken
for
completely
burrows
it
is
certain
that
old
burrows
collapse
in
the
course
of
time
for
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
the
fine
earth
voided
by
worms
if
spread
out
uniformly
would
form
in
many
places
in
the
course
of
a
year
a
layer
of
an
inch
in
thickness
so
that
at
any
rate
this
large
amount
is
not
deposited
within
the
old
unused
burrows
if
the
burrows
did
not
collapse
the
whole
ground
would
be
first
thickly
riddled
with
holes
to
a
depth
of
about
ten
inches
and
in
fifty
years
a
hollow
unsupported
space
ten
inches
in
depth
would
be
left
the
holes
left
by
the
decay
of
successively
formed
roots
of
trees
and
plants
must
likewise
collapse
in
the
course
of
time
the
burrows
of
worms
run
down
perpendicularly
or
a
little
obliquely
and
where
the
soil
is
at
all
argillaceous
there
is
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
the
walls
would
slowly
flow
or
slide
inwards
during
very
wet
weather
when
however
the
soil
is
sandy
or
mingled
with
many
small
stones
it
can
hardly
be
viscous
enough
to
flow
inwards
during
even
the
wettest
weather
but
another
agency
may
here
come
into
play
after
much
rain
the
ground
swells
and
as
it
can
not
expand
laterally
the
surface
rises
during
dry
weather
it
sinks
again
for
instance
a
large
flat
stone
laid
on
the
surface
of
a
field
sank
mm
whilst
the
weather
was
dry
between
may
and
june
and
rose
mm
between
september
and
of
the
same
year
much
rain
having
fallen
during
the
latter
part
of
this
time
during
frosts
and
thaws
the
movements
were
twice
as
great
these
observations
were
made
by
my
son
horace
who
will
hereafter
publish
an
account
of
the
movements
of
this
stone
during
successive
wet
and
dry
seasons
and
of
the
effects
of
its
being
undermined
by
worms
now
when
the
ground
swells
if
it
be
penetrated
by
cylindrical
holes
such
as
their
walls
will
tend
to
yield
and
be
pressed
inwards
and
the
yielding
will
be
greater
in
the
deeper
parts
supposing
the
whole
to
be
equally
moistened
from
the
greater
weight
of
the
superincumbent
soil
which
has
to
be
raised
than
in
the
parts
near
the
surface
when
the
ground
dries
the
walls
will
shrink
a
little
and
the
burrows
will
be
a
little
enlarged
their
enlargement
however
through
the
lateral
contraction
of
the
ground
will
not
be
favoured
but
rather
opposed
by
the
weight
of
the
superincumbent
soil
of
are
found
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
some
of
the
genera
have
an
enormous
range
they
inhabit
the
most
isolated
islands
they
abound
in
iceland
and
are
known
to
exist
in
the
west
indies
helena
madagascar
new
caledonia
and
tahiti
in
the
antarctic
regions
worms
from
kerguelen
land
have
been
described
by
ray
lankester
and
i
found
them
in
the
falkland
islands
how
they
reach
such
isolated
islands
is
at
present
quite
unknown
they
are
easily
killed
by
and
it
does
not
appear
probable
that
young
worms
or
their
could
be
carried
in
earth
adhering
to
the
feet
or
beaks
of
moreover
kerguelen
land
is
not
now
inhabited
by
any
in
this
volume
we
are
chiefly
concerned
with
the
earth
cast
up
by
worms
and
i
have
gleaned
a
few
facts
on
this
subject
with
respect
to
distant
lands
worms
throw
up
plenty
of
castings
in
the
united
states
in
venezuela
castings
probably
ejected
by
species
of
urochæta
are
common
in
the
gardens
and
fields
but
not
in
the
forests
as
i
hear
from
ernst
of
caracas
he
collected
castings
from
the
of
his
house
having
an
area
of
square
yards
they
varied
in
bulk
from
half
a
cubic
centimeter
to
five
cubic
centimeters
and
were
on
an
average
three
cubic
centimeters
they
were
therefore
of
small
size
in
comparison
with
those
often
found
in
england
for
six
large
castings
from
a
field
near
my
house
averaged
cubic
centimeters
several
species
of
are
common
in
catharina
in
south
brazil
and
fritz
müller
informs
me
that
in
most
parts
of
the
forests
and
the
whole
soil
to
a
depth
of
a
quarter
of
a
metre
looks
as
if
it
had
passed
repeatedly
through
the
intestines
of
even
where
hardly
any
castings
are
to
be
seen
on
the
a
gigantic
but
very
rare
species
is
found
there
the
burrows
of
which
are
sometimes
even
two
centimeters
or
nearly
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
which
apparently
penetrate
the
ground
to
a
great
depth
in
the
dry
climate
of
new
south
wales
i
hardly
expected
that
worms
would
be
common
but
krefft
of
sydney
to
whom
i
applied
after
making
inquiries
from
gardeners
and
others
and
from
his
own
observations
informs
me
that
their
castings
abound
he
sent
me
some
collected
after
heavy
rain
and
they
consisted
of
little
pellets
about
inch
in
diameter
and
the
blackened
sandy
earth
of
which
they
were
formed
still
cohered
with
considerable
tenacity
the
late
john
scott
of
the
botanic
gardens
near
calcutta
made
many
observations
for
me
on
worms
living
under
the
hot
and
humid
climate
of
bengal
the
castings
abound
almost
everywhere
in
jungles
and
in
the
open
ground
to
a
greater
degree
as
he
thinks
than
in
england
after
the
water
has
subsided
from
the
flooded
the
whole
surface
very
soon
becomes
studded
with
fact
which
much
surprised
scott
as
he
did
not
know
how
long
worms
could
survive
beneath
water
they
cause
much
trouble
in
the
botanic
garden
for
some
of
the
finest
of
our
lawns
can
be
kept
in
anything
like
order
only
by
being
almost
daily
rolled
if
left
undisturbed
for
a
few
days
they
become
studded
with
large
these
closely
resemble
those
described
as
abounding
near
nice
and
they
are
probably
the
work
of
a
species
of
perichæta
they
stand
up
like
towers

an
open
passage

a
figure
of
one
of
these
castings
from
a
photograph
is
here
given
fig
the
largest
received
by
me
was
inches
in
height
and
inch
in
diameter
another
was
only
inch
in
diameter
and
in
height
in
the
following
year
scott
measured
several
of
the
largest
one
was
inches
in
height
and
nearly
in
diameter
two
others
were
inches
in
height
and
respectively
and
rather
more
than
inches
in
diameter
the
average
weight
of
the
castings
sent
to
me
was
grammes
oz
and
one
of
them
weighed
grammes
or
all
these
castings
were
thrown
up
either
in
one
night
or
in
two
where
the
ground
in
bengal
is
dry
as
under
large
trees
castings
of
a
different
kind
are
found
in
vast
numbers
these
consist
of
little
oval
or
conical
bodies
from
about
the
to
rather
above
of
an
inch
in
length
they
are
obviously
voided
by
a
distinct
species
of
worms
the
period
during
which
worms
near
calcutta
display
such
extraordinary
activity
lasts
for
only
a
little
over
two
months
namely
during
the
cool
season
after
the
rains
at
this
time
they
are
generally
found
within
about
inches
beneath
the
surface
during
the
hot
season
they
burrow
to
a
greater
depth
and
are
then
found
coiled
up
and
apparently
hybernating
scott
has
never
seen
them
at
a
greater
depth
than
feet
but
has
heard
of
their
having
been
found
at
feet
within
the
forests
fresh
castings
may
be
found
even
during
the
hot
season
the
worms
in
the
botanic
garden
during
the
cool
and
dry
season
draw
many
leaves
and
little
sticks
into
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
like
our
english
worms
but
they
rarely
act
in
this
manner
during
the
rainy
season
scott
saw
on
the
lofty
mountains
of
sikkim
in
north
india
in
south
india
king
found
in
one
place
on
the
plateau
of
the
nilgiris
at
an
elevation
of
feet
a
good
many
castings
which
are
interesting
for
their
great
size
the
worms
which
eject
them
are
seen
only
during
the
wet
season
and
are
reported
to
be
from
to
inches
in
length
and
as
thick
as
a
man
s
little
finger
these
castings
were
collected
by
king
after
a
period
of
days
without
any
rain
and
they
must
have
been
ejected
either
during
the
or
more
probably
during
the
previous
monsoon
for
their
surfaces
had
suffered
some
disintegration
and
they
were
penetrated
by
many
fine
roots
a
drawing
is
here
given
fig
of
one
which
seems
to
have
best
retained
its
original
size
and
appearance
notwithstanding
some
loss
from
disintegration
five
of
the
largest
of
these
castings
after
having
been
well
weighed
each
on
an
average
grammes
or
above
oz
and
the
largest
weighed
grammes
or
is
above
a
quarter
of
a
pound
the
largest
convolutions
were
rather
more
than
one
inch
in
diameter
but
it
is
probable
that
they
had
subsided
a
little
whilst
soft
and
that
their
diameters
had
thus
been
increased
some
had
flowed
so
much
that
they
now
consisted
of
a
pile
of
almost
flat
confluent
cakes
all
were
formed
of
fine
rather
earth
and
were
surprisingly
hard
and
compact
owing
no
doubt
to
the
animal
matter
by
which
the
particles
of
earth
had
been
cemented
together
they
did
not
disintegrate
even
when
left
for
some
hours
in
water
although
they
had
been
cast
up
on
the
surface
of
gravelly
soil
they
contained
extremely
few
bits
of
rock
the
largest
of
which
was
only
inch
in
diameter
king
saw
in
ceylon
a
worm
about
feet
in
length
and
inch
in
diameter
and
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
very
common
species
during
the
wet
season
these
worms
must
throw
up
castings
at
least
as
large
as
those
on
the
nilgiri
mountains
but
king
saw
none
during
his
short
visit
to
ceylon
sufficient
facts
have
now
been
given
showing
that
worms
do
much
work
in
bringing
up
fine
earth
to
the
surface
in
most
or
all
parts
of
the
world
and
under
the
most
different
climates

we
now
come
to
the
more
immediate
subject
of
this
volume
namely
the
amount
of
earth
which
is
brought
up
by
worms
from
beneath
the
surface
and
is
afterwards
spread
out
more
or
less
completely
by
the
rain
and
wind
the
amount
can
be
judged
of
by
two
methods
the
rate
at
which
objects
left
on
the
surface
are
buried
and
more
accurately
by
weighing
the
quantity
brought
up
within
a
given
time
we
will
begin
with
the
first
method
as
it
was
first
followed
near
mael
hall
in
staffordshire
had
been
spread
about
the
year
thickly
over
a
field
of
good
which
had
not
since
been
ploughed
some
square
holes
were
dug
in
this
field
in
the
beginning
of
october
and
the
sections
showed
a
layer
of
turf
formed
by
the
matted
roots
of
the
grasses
inch
in
thickness
beneath
which
at
a
depth
of
inches
or
inches
from
the
surface
a
layer
of
the
lime
in
powder

in

and
when
the

after

of

almost
everywhere

that
they
formed

a

inch
in

at
a

of
about
inches
from

the

was
so
continuous
that
the

was

with
the

only
by
the

of

when
these
were

at

this

a

full
of

from

the
original
black
peaty
sandy
soil
with
a
few
quartz
pebbles
was
encountered
here
therefore
the
fragments
of
burnt
marl
and
cinders
had
been
covered
in
the
course
of
years
by
a
layer
of
fine
vegetable
mould
only
inches
in
thickness
excluding
the
turf
six
and
a
half
years
subsequently
this
field
was
and
the
fragments
were
now
found
at
from
to
inches
beneath
the
surface
so
that
in
this
interval
of
years
about
inch
of
mould
had
been
added
to
the
superficial
layer
i
am
surprised
that
a
greater
quantity
had
not
been
brought
up
during
the
whole
years
for
in
the
closely
underlying
black
peaty
soil
there
were
many
worms
it
is
however
probable
that
formerly
whilst
the
land
remained
poor
worms
were
scanty
and
the
mould
would
then
have
accumulated
slowly
the
average
annual
increase
of
thickness
for
the
whole
period
is
of
an
inch
two
other
cases
are
worth
recording
in
the
spring
of
a
field
which
had
long
existed
as
poor
pasture
and
was
so
swampy
that
it
trembled
slightly
when
stamped
on
was
thickly
covered
with
red
sand
so
that
the
whole
surface
appeared
at
first
bright
red
when
holes
were
dug
in
this
field
after
an
interval
of
about
years
the
sand
formed
a
layer
at
a
depth
of
in
beneath
the
surface
in
years
after
the
sand
had
been
laid
on
fresh
holes
were
dug
and
now
the
red
sand
formed
a
distinct
layer
inches
beneath
the
surface
or
inch
beneath
the
turf
so
that
on
an
average
inch
of
mould
had
been
annually
brought
to
the
surface
immediately
beneath
the
layer
of
red
sand
the
original
substratum
of
black
sandy
peat
extended
a
grass
field
likewise
not
far
from
maer
hall
had
formerly
been
thickly
covered
with
marl
and
was
then
left
for
several
years
as
pasture
it
was
afterwards
ploughed
a
friend
had
three
trenches
dug
in
this
field
years
after
the
application
of
the
marl
and
a
layer
of
the
marl
fragments
could
be
traced
at
a
depth
carefully
measured
of
inches
in
some
parts
and
of
inches
in
other
parts
this
difference
in
depth
depended
on
the
layer
being
horizontal
whilst
the
surface
consisted
of
ridges
and
furrows
from
the
field
having
been
ploughed
the
tenant
assured
me
that
it
had
never
been
turned
up
to
a
greater
depth
than
from
to
inches
and
as
the
fragments
formed
an
unbroken
horizontal
layer
from
to
inches
beneath
the
surface
these
must
have
been
buried
by
the
worms
whilst
the
land
was
in
pasture
before
it
was
ploughed
for
otherwise
they
would
have
been
indiscriminately
scattered
by
the
plough
throughout
the
whole
thickness
of
the
soil
years
afterwards
i
had
three
holes
dug
in
this
field
in
which
potatoes
had
been
lately
planted
and
the
layer
of
was
now
found
inches
beneath
the
bottoms
of
the
furrows
and
therefore
probably
inches
beneath
the
general
level
of
the
field
it
should
however
be
observed
that
the
thickness
of
the
blackish
sandy
soil
which
had
been
thrown
up
by
the
worms
above
the
in
the
course
of
years
would
have
measured
less
than
inches
if
the
field
had
always
remained
as
pasture
for
the
soil
would
in
this
case
have
been
much
more
compact
the
fragments
of
marl
almost
rested
on
an
undisturbed
substratum
of
white
sand
with
quartz
pebbles
and
as
this
would
be
little
attractive
to
worms
the
mould
would
hereafter
be
very
slowly
increased
by
their
action
we
will
now
give
some
cases
of
the
action
of
worms
on
land
differing
widely
from
the
dry
sandy
or
the
swampy
pastures
just
described
the
chalk
formation
extends
all
round
my
house
in
kent
and
its
surface
from
having
been
exposed
during
an
immense
period
to
the
dissolving
action
of
is
extremely
irregular
being
abruptly
festooned
and
penetrated
by
many
deep
cavities
during
the
dissolution
of
the
chalk
the
insoluble
matter
including
a
vast
number
of
unrolled
flints
of
all
sizes
has
been
left
on
the
surface
and
forms
a
bed
of
stiff
red
clay
full
of
flints
and
generally
from
to
feet
in
thickness
over
the
red
clay
wherever
the
land
has
long
remained
as
pasture
there
is
a
layer
a
few
inches
in
thickness
of
vegetable
mould
a
quantity
of
broken
chalk
was
spread
on
december
over
a
part
of
a
field
near
my
house
which
had
existed
as
pasture
certainly
for
probably
for
twice
or
thrice
as
many
years
the
chalk
was
laid
on
the
land
for
the
sake
of
observing
at
some
future
period
to
what
depth
it
would
become
buried
at
the
end
of
november
that
is
after
an
interval
of
years
a
trench
was
dug
across
this
part
of
the
field
and
a
line
of
white
nodules
could
be
traced
on
both
sides
of
the
trench
at
a
depth
of
inches
from
the
surface
the
mould
therefore
excluding
the
turf
had
here
been
thrown
up
at
an
average
rate
of
inch
per
year
beneath
the
line
of
chalk
nodules
there
was
in
parts
hardly
any
fine
earth
free
of
flints
while
in
other
parts
there
was
a
layer
inches
in
thickness
in
this
latter
case
the
mould
was
altogether
inches
thick
and
in
one
such
spot
a
nodule
of
chalk
and
a
smooth
flint
pebble
both
of
which
must
have
been
left
at
some
former
time
on
the
surface
were
found
at
this
depth
at
from
to
inches
beneath
the
surface
the
undisturbed
reddish
clay
full
of
flints
extended
the
appearance
of
the
above
nodules
of
chalk
surprised
me
much
at
first
as
they
closely
resembled
pebbles
whereas
the
fragments
had
been
angular
but
on
examining
the
nodules
with
a
lens
they
no
longer
appeared
for
their
surfaces
were
pitted
through
unequal
corrosion
and
minute
sharp
points
formed
of
broken
fossil
shells
projected
from
them
it
was
evident
that
the
corners
of
the
original
fragments
of
chalk
had
been
wholly
dissolved
from
presenting
a
large
surface
to
the
carbonic
acid
dissolved
in
the
and
to
that
generated
in
soil
containing
vegetable
matter
as
well
as
to
the
the
projecting
corners
would
also
relatively
to
the
other
parts
have
been
embraced
by
a
larger
number
of
living
rootlets
and
these
have
the
power
of
even
attacking
marble
as
sachs
has
shown
thus
in
the
course
of
years
buried
angular
fragments
of
chalk
had
been
converted
into
nodules
another
part
of
this
same
field
was
mossy
and
as
it
was
thought
that
sifted
would
improve
the
pasture
a
thick
layer
was
spread
over
this
part
either
in
or
and
another
layer
some
years
afterwards
in
a
trench
was
here
dug
and
many
cinders
lay
in
a
line
at
a
depth
of
inches
beneath
the
surface
with
another
line
at
a
depth
of
inches
parallel
to
the
one
beneath
in
another
part
of
this
field
which
had
formerly
existed
as
a
separate
one
and
which
it
was
believed
had
been
for
more
than
a
century
trenches
were
dug
to
see
how
thick
the
vegetable
mould
was
by
chance
the
first
trench
was
made
at
a
spot
where
at
some
former
period
certainly
more
than
forty
years
before
a
large
hole
had
been
filled
up
with
coarse
red
clay
flints
fragments
of
chalk
and
gravel
and
here
the
fine
vegetable
mould
was
only
from
to
inches
in
thickness
in
another
and
undisturbed
place
the
mould
varied
much
in
thickness
namely
from
to
inches
beneath
which
a
few
small
fragments
of
brick
were
found
in
one
place
from
these
several
cases
it
would
appear
that
during
the
last
years
mould
has
been
heaped
on
the
surface
at
an
average
annual
rate
of
from
to
of
an
inch
but
in
this
district
when
a
ploughed
field
is
first
laid
down
in
grass
the
mould
accumulates
at
a
much
slower
rate
the
rate
also
must
become
very
much
slower
after
a
bed
of
mould
several
inches
in
thickness
has
been
formed
for
the
worms
then
live
chiefly
near
the
surface
and
burrow
down
to
a
greater
depth
so
as
to
bring
up
fresh
earth
from
below
only
during
the
winter
when
the
weather
is
very
cold
at
which
time
worms
were
found
in
this
field
at
a
depth
of
inches
and
during
summer
when
the
weather
is
very
dry
a
field
which
adjoins
the
one
just
described
slopes
in
one
part
rather
steeply
at
from
to
this
part
was
last
ploughed
in
was
then
harrowed
and
left
to
become
for
several
years
it
was
clothed
with
an
extremely
scant
vegetation
and
was
so
thickly
covered
with
small
and
large
flints
some
of
them
half
as
large
as
a
child
s
head
that
the
field
was
always
called
by
my
sons
the
stony
when
they
ran
down
the
slope
the
stones
clattered
together
i
remember
doubting
whether
i
should
live
to
see
these
larger
flints
covered
with
vegetable
mould
and
turf
but
the
smaller
stones
disappeared
before
many
years
had
elapsed
as
did
every
one
of
the
larger
ones
after
a
time
so
that
after
thirty
years
a
horse
could
gallop
over
the
compact
turf
from
one
end
of
the
field
to
the
other
and
not
strike
a
single
stone
with
his
shoes
to
anyone
who
remembered
the
appearance
of
the
field
in
the
transformation
was
wonderful
this
was
certainly
the
work
of
the
worms
for
though
castings
were
not
frequent
for
several
years
yet
some
were
thrown
up
month
after
month
and
these
gradually
increased
in
numbers
as
the
pasture
improved
in
the
year
a
trench
was
dug
on
the
above
slope
and
the
blades
of
grass
were
cut
off
close
to
the
roots
so
that
the
thickness
of
the
turf
and
of
the
vegetable
mould
could
be
measured
accurately
the
turf
was
rather
less
than
half
an
inch
and
the
mould
which
did
not
contain
any
stones
inches
in
thickness
beneath
this
lay
coarse
clayey
earth
full
of
flints
like
that
in
any
of
the
neighbouring
ploughed
fields
this
coarse
earth
easily
fell
apart
from
the
overlying
mould
when
a
spit
was
lifted
up
the
average
rate
of
accumulation
of
the
mould
during
the
whole
thirty
years
was
only
inch
per
year
nearly
one
inch
in
twelve
years
but
the
rate
must
have
been
much
slower
at
first
and
afterwards
considerably
quicker
the
transformation
in
the
appearance
of
this
field
which
had
been
effected
beneath
my
eyes
was
afterwards
rendered
the
more
striking
when
i
examined
in
knole
park
a
dense
forest
of
lofty
beneath
which
nothing
grew
here
the
ground
was
thickly
strewed
with
large
naked
stones
and
were
almost
wholly
absent
obscure
lines
and
irregularities
on
the
surface
indicated
that
the
land
had
been
cultivated
some
centuries
ago
it
is
probable
that
a
thick
wood
of
young
sprung
up
so
quickly
that
time
enough
was
not
allowed
for
worms
to
cover
up
the
stones
with
their
castings
before
the
site
became
unfitted
for
their
existence
anyhow
the
contrast
between
the
state
of
the
now
miscalled
stony
field
well
stocked
with
worms
and
the
present
state
of
the
ground
beneath
the
old
in
knole
park
where
worms
appeared
to
be
absent
was
striking
a
narrow
path
running
across
part
of
my
lawn
was
paved
in
with
small
flagstones
set
edgeways
but
worms
threw
up
many
castings
and
weeds
grew
thickly
between
them
during
several
years
the
path
was
weeded
and
swept
but
ultimately
the
weeds
and
worms
prevailed
and
the
gardener
ceased
to
sweep
merely
mowing
off
the
weeds
as
often
as
the
lawn
was
mowed
the
path
soon
became
almost
covered
up
and
after
several
years
no
trace
of
it
was
left
on
removing
in
the
thin
overlying
layer
of
turf
the
small
all
in
their
proper
places
were
found
covered
by
an
inch
of
fine
mould
two
recently
published
accounts
of
substances
strewed
on
the
surface
of
having
become
buried
through
the
action
of
worms
may
be
here
noticed
the
rev
key
had
a
ditch
cut
in
a
field
over
which
had
been
spread
as
it
was
believed
eighteen
years
before
and
on
the
perpendicular
sides
of
the
ditch
at
a
depth
of
at
least
seven
inches
there
could
be
seen
for
a
length
of
yards
a
distinct
very
even
narrow
line
of
mixed
with
small
coal
perfectly
parallel
with
the
this
parallelism
and
the
length
of
the
section
give
interest
to
the
case
secondly
mr
dancer
states
that
crushed
bones
had
been
thickly
strewed
over
a
field
and
some
years
afterwards
these
were
found
several
inches
below
the
surface
at
a
uniform
the
rev
zincke
informs
me
that
he
has
lately
had
an
orchard
dug
to
the
unusual
depth
of
feet
the
upper
inches
consisted
of
vegetable
mould
and
the
next
inches
of
sandy
loam
containing
in
the
lower
part
many
rolled
pieces
of
sandstone
with
some
bits
of
brick
and
tile
probably
of
roman
origin
as
remains
of
this
period
have
been
found
close
by
the
sandy
loam
rested
on
an
indurated
ferruginous
pan
of
yellow
clay
on
the
surface
of
which
two
perfect
celts
were
found
if
as
seems
probable
the
celts
were
originally
left
on
the
surface
of
the
land
they
have
since
been
covered
up
with
earth
feet
in
thickness
all
of
which
has
probably
passed
through
the
bodies
of
worms
excepting
the
stones
which
may
have
been
scattered
on
the
surface
at
different
times
together
with
manure
or
by
other
means
it
is
difficult
otherwise
to
understand
the
source
of
the
inches
of
sandy
loam
which
differed
from
the
overlying
dark
vegetable
mould
after
both
had
been
burnt
only
in
being
of
a
brighter
red
colour
and
in
not
being
quite
so
but
on
this
view
we
must
suppose
that
the
carbon
in
vegetable
mould
when
it
lies
at
some
little
depth
beneath
the
surface
and
does
not
continually
receive
decaying
vegetable
matter
from
above
loses
its
dark
colour
in
the
course
of
centuries
but
whether
this
is
probable
i
do
not
know
worms
appear
to
act
in
the
same
manner
in
new
zealand
as
in
europe
for
professor
von
haast
has
described
a
section
near
the
coast
consisting
of
covered
by
or
feet
of
loess
above
which
about
inches
of
vegetable
soil
had
between
the
loess
and
the
mould
there
was
a
layer
from
to
inches
in
thickness
consisting
of
cores
implements
flakes
and
chips
all
manufactured
from
hard
basaltic
it
is
therefore
probable
that
the
aborigines
at
some
former
period
had
left
these
objects
on
the
surface
and
that
they
had
afterwards
been
slowly
covered
up
by
the
castings
of
worms
farmers
in
england
are
well
aware
that
objects
of
all
kinds
left
on
the
surface
of
after
a
time
disappear
or
as
they
say
work
themselves
downwards
how
powdered
lime
cinders
and
heavy
stones
can
work
down
and
at
the
same
rate
through
the
matted
roots
of
a
surface
is
a
question
which
has
probably
never
occurred
to
them
sinking
of
great
stones
through
the
action
of
a
stone
of
large
size
and
of
irregular
shape
is
left
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
it
rests
of
course
on
the
more
protuberant
parts
but
worms
soon
fill
up
with
their
castings
all
the
hollow
spaces
on
the
lower
side
for
as
hensen
remarks
they
like
the
shelter
of
stones
as
soon
as
the
hollows
are
filled
up
the
worms
eject
the
earth
which
they
have
swallowed
beyond
the
circumference
of
the
stones
and
thus
the
surface
of
the
ground
is
raised
all
round
the
stone
as
the
burrows
excavated
directly
beneath
the
stone
after
a
time
collapse
the
stone
sinks
a
little
hence
it
is
that
boulders
which
at
some
ancient
period
have
rolled
down
from
a
rocky
mountain
or
cliff
on
to
a
meadow
at
its
base
are
always
somewhat
imbedded
in
the
soil
and
when
removed
leave
an
exact
impression
of
their
lower
surfaces
in
the
underlying
fine
mould
if
however
a
boulder
is
of
such
huge
dimensions
that
the
earth
beneath
is
kept
dry
such
earth
will
not
be
inhabited
by
worms
and
the
boulder
will
not
sink
into
the
ground
a
formerly
stood
in
a
near
leith
hill
place
in
surrey
and
was
pulled
down
years
before
my
visit
all
the
loose
rubbish
had
been
carted
away
excepting
three
large
stones
of
quartzose
sandstone
which
it
was
thought
might
hereafter
be
of
some
use
an
old
workman
remembered
that
they
had
been
left
on
a
bare
surface
of
broken
bricks
and
mortar
close
to
the
foundations
of
the
kiln
but
the
whole
surrounding
surface
is
now
covered
with
turf
and
mould
the
two
largest
of
these
stones
had
never
since
been
moved
nor
could
this
easily
have
been
done
as
when
i
had
them
removed
it
was
the
work
of
two
men
with
levers
one
of
these
stones
and
not
the
largest
was
inches
long
inches
broad
and
from
to
inches
in
thickness
its
lower
surface
was
somewhat
protuberant
in
the
middle
and
this
part
still
rested
on
broken
bricks
and
mortar
showing
the
truth
of
the
old
workman
s
account
beneath
the
brick
rubbish
the
natural
sandy
soil
full
of
fragments
of
sandstone
was
found
and
this
could
have
yielded
very
little
if
at
all
to
the
weight
of
the
stone
as
might
have
been
expected
if
the
had
been
clay
the
surface
of
the
field
for
a
distance
of
about
inches
round
the
stone
gradually
sloped
up
to
it
and
close
to
the
stone
stood
in
most
places
about
inches
above
the
surrounding
ground
the
base
of
the
stone
was
buried
from
to
inches
beneath
the
general
level
and
the
upper
surface
projected
about
inches
above
this
level
or
about
inches
above
the
sloping
border
of
turf
after
the
removal
of
the
stone
it
became
evident
that
one
of
its
pointed
ends
must
at
first
have
stood
clear
above
the
ground
by
some
inches
but
its
upper
surface
was
now
on
a
level
with
the
surrounding
turf
when
the
stone
was
removed
an
exact
cast
of
its
lower
side
forming
a
shallow
crateriform
hollow
was
left
the
inner
surface
of
which
consisted
of
fine
black
mould
excepting
where
the
more
protuberant
parts
rested
on
the
a
transverse
section
of
this
stone
together
with
its
bed
drawn
from
measurements
made
after
it
had
been
displaced
is
here
given
on
a
scale
of
inch
to
a
foot
fig
the
border
which
sloped
up
to
the
stone
consisted
of
fine
vegetable
mould
in
one
part
inches
in
thickness
this
evidently
consisted
of
several
of
which
had
been
recently
ejected
the
whole
stone
had
sunk
in
the
years
as
far
as
i
could
judge
about
inch
and
this
must
have
been
due
to
the
beneath
the
more
protuberant
parts
having
been
undermined
by
worms
at
this
rate
the
upper
surface
of
the
stone
if
it
had
been
left
undisturbed
would
have
sunk
to
the
general
level
of
the
field
in
years
but
before
this
could
have
occurred
some
earth
would
have
been
washed
down
by
heavy
rain
from
the
castings
on
the
raised
border
of
turf
over
the
upper
surface
of
the
stone
the
second
stone
was
larger
that
the
one
just
described
inches
in
length
in
breadth
and
in
thickness
the
lower
surface
was
nearly
flat
so
that
the
worms
must
soon
have
been
compelled
to
eject
their
castings
beyond
its
circumference
the
stone
as
a
whole
had
sunk
about
inches
into
the
ground
at
this
rate
it
would
have
required
years
for
its
upper
surface
to
have
sunk
to
the
general
level
of
the
field
the
upwardly
sloping
border
round
the
stone
was
broader
than
in
the
last
case
from
to
inches
and
why
this
should
be
so
i
could
see
no
reason
in
most
parts
this
border
was
not
so
high
as
in
the
last
case
from
to
inches
but
in
one
place
it
was
as
much
as
its
average
height
close
to
the
stone
was
probably
about
inches
and
it
thinned
out
to
nothing
if
so
a
layer
of
fine
earth
inches
in
breadth
and
inch
in
average
thickness
of
sufficient
length
to
surround
the
whole
of
the
much
elongated
slab
must
have
been
brought
up
by
the
worms
in
chief
part
from
beneath
the
stone
in
the
course
of
years
this
amount
would
be
amply
sufficient
to
account
for
its
having
sunk
about
inches
into
the
ground
more
especially
if
we
bear
in
mind
that
a
good
deal
of
the
finest
earth
would
have
been
washed
by
heavy
rain
from
the
castings
ejected
on
the
sloping
border
down
to
the
level
of
the
field
some
fresh
castings
were
seen
close
to
the
stone
nevertheless
on
digging
a
large
hole
to
a
depth
of
inches
where
the
stone
had
lain
only
two
worms
and
a
few
burrows
were
seen
although
the
soil
was
damp
and
seemed
favourable
for
worms
there
were
some
large
colonies
of
ants
beneath
the
stone
and
possibly
since
their
establishment
the
worms
had
decreased
in
number
the
third
stone
was
only
about
half
as
large
as
the
others
and
two
strong
boys
could
together
have
rolled
it
over
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
had
been
rolled
over
at
a
moderately
recent
time
for
it
now
lay
at
some
distance
from
the
two
other
stones
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
adjoining
slope
it
rested
also
on
fine
earth
instead
of
partly
on
in
agreement
with
this
conclusion
the
raised
surrounding
border
of
turf
was
only
inch
high
in
some
parts
and
inches
in
other
parts
there
were
no
colonies
of
ants
beneath
this
stone
and
on
digging
a
hole
where
it
had
lain
several
burrows
and
worms
were
found
at
stonehenge
some
of
the
outer
druidical
stones
are
now
prostrate
having
fallen
at
a
remote
but
unknown
period
and
these
have
become
buried
to
a
moderate
depth
in
the
ground
they
are
surrounded
by
sloping
borders
of
turf
on
which
recent
castings
were
seen
close
to
one
of
these
fallen
stones
which
was
ft
long
broad
and
inches
thick
a
hole
was
dug
and
here
the
vegetable
mould
was
at
least
inches
in
thickness
at
this
depth
a
flint
was
found
and
a
little
higher
up
on
one
side
of
the
hole
a
fragment
of
glass
the
base
of
the
stone
lay
about
inches
beneath
the
level
of
the
surrounding
ground
and
its
upper
surface
inches
above
the
ground
a
hole
was
also
dug
close
to
a
second
huge
stone
which
in
falling
had
broken
into
two
pieces
and
this
must
have
happened
long
ago
judging
from
the
weathered
aspect
of
the
fractured
ends
the
base
was
buried
to
a
depth
of
inches
as
was
ascertained
by
driving
an
iron
skewer
horizontally
into
the
ground
beneath
it
the
vegetable
mould
forming
the
sloping
border
round
the
stone
on
which
many
castings
had
recently
been
ejected
was
inches
in
thickness
and
most
of
this
mould
must
have
been
brought
up
by
worms
from
beneath
its
base
at
a
distance
of
yards
from
the
stone
the
mould
was
only
inches
in
thickness
with
a
piece
of
tobacco
pipe
at
a
depth
of
inches
and
this
rested
on
broken
flint
and
chalk
which
could
not
have
easily
yielded
to
the
pressure
or
weight
of
the
stone
a
straight
rod
was
fixed
horizontally
by
the
aid
of
a
across
a
third
fallen
stone
which
was
feet
inches
long
and
the
contour
of
the
projecting
parts
and
of
the
adjoining
ground
which
was
not
quite
level
was
thus
ascertained
as
shown
in
the
accompanying
diagram
fig
on
a
scale
of
inch
to
a
foot
the
border
sloped
up
to
the
stone
on
one
side
to
a
height
of
inches
and
on
the
opposite
side
to
only
inches
above
the
general
level
a
hole
was
dug
on
the
eastern
side
and
the
base
of
the
stone
was
here
found
to
lie
at
a
depth
of
inches
beneath
the
general
level
of
the
ground
and
of
inches
beneath
the
top
of
the
sloping
border
sufficient
evidence
has
now
been
given
showing
that
small
objects
left
on
the
surface
of
the
land
where
worms
abound
soon
get
buried
and
that
large
stones
sink
slowly
downwards
through
the
same
means
every
step
of
the
process
could
be
followed
from
the
accidental
deposition
of
a
single
casting
on
a
small
object
lying
loose
on
the
surface
to
its
being
entangled
amidst
the
matted
roots
of
the
turf
and
lastly
to
its
being
embedded
in
the
mould
at
various
depths
beneath
the
surface
when
the
same
field
was
after
the
interval
of
a
few
years
such
objects
were
found
at
a
greater
depth
than
before
the
straightness
and
regularity
of
the
lines
formed
by
the
imbedded
objects
and
their
parallelism
with
the
surface
of
the
land
are
the
most
striking
features
of
the
case
for
this
parallelism
shows
how
equably
the
worms
must
have
worked
the
result
being
however
partly
the
effect
of
the
washing
down
of
the
fresh
castings
by
rain
the
specific
gravity
of
the
objects
does
not
affect
their
rate
of
sinking
as
could
be
seen
by
porous
cinders
burnt
marl
chalk
and
quartz
pebbles
having
all
sunk
to
the
same
depth
within
the
same
time
considering
the
nature
of
the
substratum
which
at
leith
hill
place
was
sandy
soil
including
many
bits
of
rock
and
at
stonehenge
with
broken
flints
considering
also
the
presence
of
the
sloping
border
of
mould
round
the
great
fragments
of
stone
at
both
these
places
their
sinking
does
not
appear
to
have
been
sensibly
aided
by
their
weight
though
this
was
considerable
the
number
of
worms
which
live
within
a
given
will
now
show
firstly
what
a
vast
number
of
worms
live
unseen
by
us
beneath
our
feet
and
secondly
the
actual
weight
of
the
earth
which
they
bring
up
to
the
surface
within
a
given
space
and
within
a
given
time
hensen
who
has
published
so
full
and
interesting
an
account
of
the
habits
of
worms
calculates
from
the
number
which
he
found
in
a
measured
space
that
there
must
exist
living
worms
in
a
hectare
of
land
or
in
an
acre
this
latter
number
of
worms
would
weigh
pounds
taking
hensen
s
standard
of
the
weight
of
a
single
worm
namely
three
grams
it
should
however
be
noted
that
this
calculation
is
founded
on
the
numbers
found
in
a
garden
and
hensen
believes
that
worms
are
here
twice
as
numerous
as
in
the
above
result
astonishing
though
it
be
seems
to
me
credible
judging
from
the
number
of
worms
which
i
have
sometimes
seen
and
from
the
number
daily
destroyed
by
birds
without
the
species
being
exterminated
some
barrels
of
bad
ale
were
left
on
miller
s
land
in
the
hope
of
making
vinegar
but
the
vinegar
proved
bad
and
the
barrels
were
upset
it
should
be
premised
that
acetic
acid
is
so
deadly
a
poison
to
worms
that
perrier
found
that
a
glass
rod
dipped
into
this
acid
and
then
into
a
considerable
body
of
water
in
which
worms
were
immersed
invariably
killed
them
quickly
on
the
morning
after
the
barrels
had
been
upset
the
heaps
of
worms
which
lay
dead
on
the
ground
were
so
amazing
that
if
miller
had
not
seen
them
he
could
not
have
thought
it
possible
for
such
numbers
to
have
existed
in
the
as
further
evidence
of
the
large
number
of
worms
which
live
in
the
ground
hensen
states
that
he
found
in
a
garden
open
burrows
in
a
space
of
square
feet
that
is
nine
in
square
feet
but
the
burrows
are
sometimes
much
more
numerous
for
when
digging
in
a
near
maer
hall
i
found
a
cake
of
dry
earth
as
large
as
my
two
open
hands
which
was
penetrated
by
seven
burrows
as
large
as
of
the
earth
ejected
from
a
single
from
all
the
burrows
within
a
given
respect
to
the
weight
of
the
earth
daily
ejected
by
worms
hensen
found
that
it
amounted
in
the
case
of
some
worms
which
he
kept
in
confinement
and
which
he
appears
to
have
fed
with
leaves
to
only
gram
or
less
than
grains
per
diem
but
a
very
much
larger
amount
must
be
ejected
by
worms
in
their
natural
state
at
the
periods
when
they
consume
earth
as
food
instead
of
leaves
and
when
they
are
making
deep
burrows
this
is
rendered
almost
certain
by
the
following
weights
of
the
castings
thrown
up
at
the
mouths
of
single
burrows
the
whole
of
which
appeared
to
have
been
ejected
within
no
long
time
as
was
certainly
the
case
in
several
instances
the
castings
were
dried
excepting
in
one
specified
instance
by
exposure
during
many
days
to
the
sun
or
before
a
hot
fire
weight
of
the
castings
accumulated
at
the
mouth
of
a
single
burrow
down
kent
red
clay
full
of
flints
the
chalk
the
largest
casting
which
i
could
find
on
the
flanks
of
a
steep
valley
the
being
here
shallow
in
this
one
case
the
casting
was
not
well
dried
casting
which
i
could
find
consisting
chiefly
of
calcareous
matter
on
extremely
poor
pasture
land

the
largest

in

poor
and
these
as
far
as
i
have
seen
are
generally
larger
than
those
on

producing
a

it
would
appear
that
worms
have
to
swallow
a
greater
amount
of

on
poor
than
on
rich
land
in
order
to
obtain
sufficient
nutriment
with
respect
to
the
castings
near

and
in
the
above
table
king
often
found
five
or
six
of
them
on
a
square
foot
of
surface
and
these
judging
from
their
average
weight
would
have
weighed
together
ounces
so
that
the
weight
of
those
on
a
square

would
have
been
lb
oz
king
collected
near
the
close
of
the
year
all
the
castings
which
still
retained
their
vermiform
shape
whether
broken
down
or
not
from
a
square
foot
in
a
place
abounding
with
worms
on
the
summit
of
a
bank
where
no
castings
could
have
rolled
down
from
above
these
castings
must
have
been
ejected
as
he
judged
from
their
appearance
in
reference
to
the
rainy
and
dry
periods
near
nice
within
the
previous
five
or
six
months
they
weighed
or
lb
oz
per
square

after
an
interval
of
four
months
king
collected
all
the
castings
subsequently
ejected
on
the
same
square
foot
of
surface
and
they
weighed
or
lb
oz
per
square
yard
therefore
within
about
ten
months
or
we
will
say
for
safety
s
sake
within
a
year
oz
of
castings
were
thrown
up
on
this
one
square
foot
or
pounds
on
the
square
yard
and
this
would
give
tons
per
acre
in
a
field
at
the
bottom
of
a
valley
in
the
chalk
see
no
in
the
foregoing
table
a
square
yard
was
measured
at
a
spot
where
very
large
castings
abounded
they
appeared
however
almost
equally
numerous
in
a
few
other
places
these
castings
which
retained
perfectly
their
vermiform
shape
were
collected
and
they
weighed
when
partially
dried
lb
oz
this
field
had
been
rolled
with
a
heavy
agricultural
roller
days
before
and
this
would
certainly
have
flattened
every
single
casting
on
the
land
the
weather
had
been
very
dry
for
two
or
three
weeks
before
the
day
of
collection
so
that
not
one
casting
appeared
fresh
or
had
been
recently
ejected
we
may
therefore
assume
that
those
which
were
weighed
had
been
ejected
within
we
will
say
forty
days
from
the
time
when
the
field
was
rolled
is
twelve
days
short
of
the
whole
intervening
period
i
had
examined
the
same
part
of
the
field
shortly
before
it
was
rolled
and
it
then
abounded
with
fresh
castings
worms
do
not
work
in
dry
weather
during
the
summer
or
in
winter
during
severe
frosts
if
we
assume
that
they
work
for
only
half
the
this
is
too
low
an
the
worms
in
this
field
would
eject
during
the
year
pounds
per
square
yard
or
tons
per
acre
assuming
the
whole
surface
to
be
equally
productive
in
castings
in
the
foregoing
cases
some
of
the
necessary
data
had
to
be
estimated
but
in
the
two
following
cases
the
results
are
much
more
trustworthy
a
lady
on
whose
accuracy
i
can
implicitly
rely
offered
to
collect
during
a
year
all
the
castings
thrown
up
on
two
separate
square
yards
near
leith
hill
place
in
surrey
the
amount
collected
was
however
somewhat
less
than
that
originally
ejected
by
the
worms
for
as
i
have
repeatedly
observed
a
good
deal
of
the
finest
earth
is
washed
away
whenever
castings
are
thrown
up
during
or
shortly
before
heavy
rain
small
portions
also
adhered
to
the
surrounding
blades
of
grass
and
it
required
too
much
time
to
detach
every
one
of
them
on
sandy
soil
as
in
the
present
instance
castings
are
liable
to
crumble
after
dry
weather
and
particles
were
thus
often
lost
the
lady
also
occasionally
left
home
for
a
week
or
two
and
at
such
times
the
castings
must
have
suffered
still
greater
loss
from
exposure
to
the
weather
these
losses
were
however
compensated
to
some
extent
by
the
collections
having
been
made
on
one
of
the
squares
for
four
days
and
on
the
other
square
for
two
days
more
than
the
year
a
space
was
selected
october
for
one
of
the
squares
on
a
broad
terrace
which
had
been
mowed
and
swept
during
many
years
it
faced
the
south
but
was
shaded
during
part
of
the
day
by
trees
it
had
been
formed
at
least
a
century
ago
by
a
great
accumulation
of
small
and
large
fragments
of
sandstone
together
with
some
sandy
earth
rammed
down
level
it
is
probable
that
it
was
at
first
protected
by
being
covered
with
turf
this
terrace
judging
from
the
number
of
castings
on
it
was
rather
unfavourable
for
the
existence
of
worms
in
comparison
with
the
neighbouring
fields
and
an
upper
terrace
it
was
indeed
surprising
that
as
many
worms
could
live
here
as
were
seen
for
on
digging
a
hole
in
this
terrace
the
black
vegetable
mould
together
with
the
turf
was
only
four
inches
in
thickness
beneath
which
lay
the
level
surface
of
sandy
soil
with
many
fragments
of
sandstone
before
any
castings
were
collected
all
the
previously
existing
ones
were
carefully
removed
the
last
day
s
collection
was
on
october
the
castings
were
then
well
dried
before
a
fire
and
they
weighed
exactly
lbs
this
would
give
for
an
acre
of
similar
land
tons
of
dry
earth
annually
ejected
by
worms
the
second
square
was
marked
on
unenclosed
common
land
at
a
height
of
about
above
the
sea
at
some
little
distance
from
leith
hill
tower
the
surface
was
clothed
with
short
fine
turf
and
had
never
been
disturbed
by
the
hand
of
man
the
spot
selected
appeared
neither
particularly
favourable
nor
the
reverse
for
worms
but
i
have
often
noticed
that
castings
are
especially
abundant
on
common
land
and
this
may
perhaps
be
attributed
to
the
poorness
of
the
soil
the
vegetable
mould
was
here
between
three
and
four
inches
in
thickness
as
this
spot
was
at
some
distance
from
the
house
where
the
lady
lived
the
castings
were
not
collected
at
such
short
intervals
of
time
as
those
on
the
terrace
consequently
the
loss
of
fine
earth
during
rainy
weather
must
have
been
greater
in
this
than
in
the
last
case
the
castings
moreover
were
more
sandy
and
in
collecting
them
during
dry
weather
they
sometimes
crumbled
into
dust
and
much
was
thus
lost
therefore
it
is
certain
that
the
worms
brought
up
to
the
surface
considerably
more
earth
than
that
which
was
collected
the
last
collection
was
made
on
october
days
after
the
square
had
been
marked
out
and
the
surface
cleared
of
all
castings
the
collected
castings
after
being
well
dried
weighed
pounds
and
this
would
give
for
an
acre
of
the
same
kind
of
land

of

ejected

we
know
from
the
two
last
cases
in
the
above
summary
the
weight
of
the
dried
castings
ejected
by
worms
during
a
year
on
a
square
yard
of
surface
i
wished
to
learn
how
thick
a
layer
of
ordinary
mould
this
amount
would
form
if
spread
uniformly
over
a
square
yard
the
dry
castings
were
therefore
broken
into
small
particles
and
whilst
being
placed
in
a
measure
were
well
shaken
and
pressed
down
those
collected
on
the
terrace
amounted
to
cubic
inches
and
this
amount
if
spread
out
over
a
square
yard
would
make
a
layer
inch
in
thickness
those
collected
on
the
common
amounted
to
cubic
inches
and
would
make
a
similar
layer
inch
in
thickness
these
thicknesses
must
however
be
corrected
for
the
triturated
castings
after
being
well
shaken
down
and
pressed
did
not
make
nearly
so
compact
a
mass
as
vegetable
mould
though
each
separate
particle
was
very
compact
yet
mould
is
far
from
being
compact
as
is
shown
by
the
number
of
which
rise
up
when
the
surface
is
flooded
with
water
it
is
moreover
penetrated
by
many
fine
roots
to
ascertain
approximately
by
how
much
ordinary
vegetable
mould
would
be
increased
in
bulk
by
being
broken
up
into
small
particles
and
then
dried
a
thin
oblong
block
of
somewhat
argillaceous
mould
with
the
turf
pared
off
was
measured
before
being
broken
up
was
well
dried
and
again
measured
the
drying
caused
it
to
shrink
by
of
its
original
bulk
judging
from
exterior
measurements
alone
it
was
then
triturated
and
partly
reduced
to
powder
in
the
same
manner
as
the
castings
had
been
treated
and
its
bulk
now
exceeded
notwithstanding
shrinkage
from
drying
by
that
of
the
original
block
of
damp
mould
therefore
the
above
calculated
thickness
of
the
layer
formed
by
the
castings
from
the
terrace
after
being
damped
and
spread
over
a
square
yard
would
have
to
be
reduced
by
and
this
will
reduce
the
layer
to
of
an
inch
so
that
a
layer
inch
in
thickness
would
be
formed
in
the
course
of
ten
years
on
the
same
principle
the
castings
from
the
common
would
make
in
the
course
of
a
single
year
a
layer
inch
or
in
the
course
of
years
inch
in
thickness
we
may
say
in
round
numbers
that
the
thickness
in
the
former
case
would
amount
to
nearly
inch
and
in
the
second
case
to
nearly
inch
in
years
in
order
to
compare
these
results
with
those
deduced
from
the
rates
at
which
small
objects
left
on
the
surfaces
of
become
buried
as
described
in
the
early
part
of
this
chapter
we
will
give
the
following
summary
summary
of
the
thickness
of
the
mould
accumulated
over
objects
left
strewed
on
the
surface
in
the
course
of
ten
years
the
accumulation
of
mould
during
years
on
the
surface
of
a
dry
sandy
near
maer
hall
amounted
to
inches
in
years
the
accumulation
during
years
on
a
swampy
field
near
maer
hall
amounted
to
nearly
inch
in
years
the
accumulation
during
years
on
a
very
swampy
field
near
maer
hall
amounted
to
inches
in
years
the
accumulation
during
years
on
good
argillaceous
over
the
chalk
at
down
amounted
to
inches
in
years
the
accumulation
during
years
on
the
side
of
a
valley
over
the
chalk
at
down
the
soil
being
argillaceous
very
poor
and
only
just
converted
into
pasture
so
that
it
was
for
some
years
unfavourable
for
worms
amounted
to
inch
in
years
in
these
cases
excepting
the
last
it
may
be
seen
that
the
amount
of
earth
brought
to
the
surface
during
years
is
somewhat
greater
than
that
calculated
from
the
castings
which
were
actually
weighed
this
excess
may
be
partly
accounted
for
by
the
loss
which
the
weighed
castings
had
previously
undergone
through
being
washed
by
rain
by
the
adhesion
of
particles
to
the
blades
of
the
surrounding
grass
and
by
their
crumbling
when
dry
nor
must
we
overlook
other
agencies
which
in
all
ordinary
cases
add
to
the
amount
of
mould
and
which
would
not
be
included
in
the
castings
that
were
collected
namely
the
fine
earth
brought
up
to
the
surface
by
burrowing
larvæ
and
insects
especially
by
ants
the
earth
brought
up
by
moles
generally
has
a
somewhat
different
appearance
from
vegetable
mould
but
after
a
time
would
not
be
distinguishable
from
it
in
dry
countries
moreover
the
wind
plays
an
important
part
in
carrying
dust
from
one
place
to
another
and
even
in
england
it
must
add
to
the
mould
on
fields
near
great
roads
but
in
our
country
these
latter
several
agencies
appear
to
be
of
quite
subordinate
importance
in
comparison
with
the
action
of
worms
we
have
no
means
of
judging
how
great
a
weight
of
earth
a
single
worm
ejects
during
a
year
hensen
estimates
that
worms
exist
in
an
acre
of
land
but
this
is
founded
on
the
number
found
in
gardens
and
he
believes
that
only
about
half
as
many
live
in
how
many
live
in
old
pasture
land
is
unknown
but
if
we
assume
that
half
the
above
number
or
worms
live
on
such
land
then
taking
from
the
previous
summary
tons
as
the
weight
of
the
castings
annually
thrown
up
on
an
acre
of
land
each
worm
must
annually
eject
ounces
a
casting
at
the
mouth
of
a
single
burrow
often
exceeds
as
we
have
seen
an
ounce
in
weight
and
it
is
probable
that
worms
eject
more
than
castings
during
a
year
if
they
eject
annually
more
than
ounces
we
may
infer
that
the
worms
which
live
in
an
acre
of
pasture
land
must
be
less
than
in
number
worms
live
chiefly
in
the
superficial
mould
which
is
usually
from
or
to
and
even
inches
in
thickness
and
it
is
this
mould
which
passes
over
and
over
again
through
their
bodies
and
is
brought
to
the
surface
but
worms
occasionally
burrow
into
the
subsoil
to
a
much
greater
depth
and
on
such
occasions
they
bring
up
earth
from
this
greater
depth
and
this
process
has
gone
on
for
countless
ages
therefore
the
superficial
layer
of
mould
would
ultimately
attain
though
at
a
slower
and
slower
rate
a
thickness
equal
to
the
depth
to
which
worms
ever
burrow
were
there
not
other
opposing
agencies
at
work
which
carry
away
to
a
lower
level
some
of
the
finest
earth
which
is
continually
being
brought
to
the
surface
by
worms
how
great
a
thickness
vegetable
mould
ever
attains
i
have
not
had
good
opportunities
for
observing
but
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
consider
the
burial
of
ancient
buildings
some
facts
will
be
given
on
this
head
in
the
two
last
chapters
we
shall
see
that
the
soil
is
actually
increased
though
only
to
a
small
degree
through
the
agency
of
worms
but
their
chief
work
is
to
sift
the
finer
from
the
coarser
particles
to
mingle
the
whole
with
vegetable
débris
and
to
saturate
it
with
their
intestinal
secretions
finally
no
one
who
considers
the
facts
given
in
this
the
burying
of
small
objects
and
on
the
sinking
of
great
stones
left
on
the
the
vast
number
of
worms
which
live
within
a
moderate
extent
of
ground
on
the
weight
of
the
castings
ejected
from
the

of
some
of
the
archæologists
are
probably
not
aware
how
much
they
owe
to
worms
for
the
preservation
of
many
ancient
objects
coins
gold
ornaments
stone
implements
if
dropped
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
will
infallibly
be
buried
by
the
castings
of
worms
in
a
few
years
and
will
thus
be
safely
preserved
until
the

at
some
future
time
is
turned
up
for

many
years
ago
a
was
ploughed
on
the
northern
side
of
the
severn
not
far
from
shrewsbury
and
a
surprising
number
of
iron
were
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
furrows
which
as
blakeway
a
local
antiquary
believed
were
relics
of
the
battle
of
shrewsbury
in
the
year
and
no
doubt
had
been
originally
left
strewed
on
the
in
the
present
chapter
i
shall
show
that
not
only
implements
are
thus
preserved
but
that
the
floors
and
the
remains
of
many
ancient
buildings
in
england
have
been
buried
so
effectually
in
large
part
through
the
action
of
worms
that
they
have
been
discovered
in
recent
times
solely
through
various
accidents
the
enormous
beds
of
rubbish
several
yards
in
thickness
which
underlie
many
cities
such
as
rome
paris
and
london
the
lower
ones
being
of
great
antiquity
are
not
here
referred
to
as
they
have
not
been
in
any
way
acted
on
by
worms
when
we
consider
how
much
matter
is
daily
brought
into
a
great
city
for
building
fuel
clothing
and
food
and
that
in
old
times
when
the
roads
were
bad
and
the
work
of
the
scavenger
was
neglected
a
comparatively
small
amount
was
carried
away
we
may
agree
with
élie
de
beaumont
who
in
discussing
this
subject
says
pour
une
voiture
de
matériaux
qui
en
sort
on
y
en
fait

nor
should
we
overlook
the
effects
of
fires
the
demolition
of
old
buildings
and
the
removal
of
rubbish
to
the
nearest
vacant
space
in
the
autumn
of
the
ground
in
an
old
at
this
place
was
dug
to
a
depth
of
to
feet
and
the
workmen
found
various
ancient
remains

led
farrer
of
abinger
hall
to
have
an
adjoining
ploughed
field
searched
on
a
trench
being
dug
a
layer
of
concrete
still
partly
covered
with
tesseræ
small
red
tiles
and
surrounded
on
two
sides
by
walls
was
soon
discovered
it
is
believed
that
this
room
formed
part
of
the
atrium
or
of
a
roman
villa
the
walls
of
two
or
three
other
small
rooms
were
afterwards
discovered
many
fragments
of
pottery
other
objects
and
coins
of
several
roman
emperors
dating
from
to
and
perhaps
to
were
likewise
found
also
a
of
george
the
presence
of
this
latter
coin
seems
an
anomaly
but
no
doubt
it
was
dropped
on
the
ground
during
the
last
century
and
since
then
there
has
been
ample
time
for
its
burial
under
a
considerable
depth
of
the
castings
of
worms
from
the
different
dates
of
the
roman
coins
we
may
infer
that
the
building
was
long
inhabited
it
was
probably
ruined
and
deserted
or
years
ago
i
was
present
during
the
commencement
of
the
excavations
august
and
farrer
had
two
deep
trenches
dug
at
opposite
ends
of
the
atrium
so
that
i
might
examine
the
nature
of
the
soil
near
the
remains
the
field
sloped
from
east
to
west
at
an
angle
of
about
and
one
of
the
two
trenches
shown
in
the
accompanying
section
fig
was
at
the
upper
or
eastern
end
the
diagram
is
on
a
scale
of
of
an
inch
to
an
inch
but
the
trench
which
was
between
and
feet
broad
and
in
parts
above
feet
deep
has
necessarily
been
reduced
out
of
all
proportion
the
fine
mould
over
the
floor
of
the
atrium
varied
in
thickness
from
to
inches
and
on
the
side
of
the
trench
in
the
section
was
a
little
over
inches
after
the
mould
had
been
removed
the
floor
appeared
as
a
whole
moderately
level
but
it
sloped
in
parts
at
an
angle
of
and
in
one
place
near
the
outside
at
as
much
as
the
wall
surrounding
the
pavement
was
built
of
rough
stones
and
was
inches
in
thickness
where
the
trench
was
dug
its
broken
summit
was
here
inches
but
in
another
part
inches
beneath
the
surface
of
the
field
being
covered
by
this
thickness
of
mould
in
one
spot
however
it
rose
to
within
inches
of
the
surface
on
two
sides
of
the
room
where
the
junction
of
the
concrete
floor
with
the
bounding
walls
could
be
carefully
examined
there
was
no
crack
or
separation
this
trench
afterwards
proved
to
have
been
dug
within
an
adjoining
room
by
in
in

existence
of
which
was
not
even
suspected

the

varied
from
to
inches
in

it
rested
on
a

inches
thick

black

as
this
would
have
brought

of

to

two
thin

an
entire

beneath

surface
the
second
trench
was
dug
on
the
western
or
lower
side
of
the
villa
the
mould
was
here
only
inches
in
thickness
and
it
rested
on
a
mass
of
fine
earth
full
of
stones
broken
tiles
and
fragments
of
mortar
inches
in
thickness
beneath
which
was
the
undisturbed
sand
most
of
this
earth
had
probably
been
washed
down
from
the
upper
part
of
the
field
and
the
fragments
of
stones
tiles
must
have
come
from
the
immediately
adjoining
ruins
it
appears
at
first
sight
a
surprising
fact
that
this
field
of
light
sandy
soil
should
have
been
cultivated
and
ploughed
during
many
years
and
that
not
a
vestige
of
these
buildings
should
have
been
discovered
no
one
even
suspected
that
the
remains
of
a
roman
villa
lay
hidden
close
beneath
the
surface
but
the
fact
is
less
surprising
when
it
is
known
that
the
field
as
the
bailiff
believed
had
never
been
ploughed
to
a
greater
depth
than
inches
it
is
certain
that
when
the
land
was
first
ploughed
the
pavement
and
the
surrounding
broken
walls
must
have
been
covered
by
at
least
inches
of
soil
for
otherwise
the
rotten
concrete
floor
would
have
been
scored
by
the
ploughshare
the
tesseræ
torn
up
and
the
tops
of
the
old
walls
knocked
down
when
the
concrete
and
tesseræ
were
first
cleared
over
a
space
of
by
the
floor
which
was
coated
with
earth
exhibited
no
signs
of
having
been
penetrated
by
worms
and
although
the
overlying
fine
mould
closely
resembled
that
which
in
many
places
has
certainly
been
accumulated
by
worms
yet
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
this
mould
could
have
been
brought
up
by
worms
from
beneath
the
apparently
sound
floor
it
seemed
also
extremely
improbable
that
the
thick
walls
surrounding
the
room
and
still
united
to
the
concrete
had
been
undermined
by
worms
and
had
thus
been
caused
to
sink
being
afterwards
covered
up
by
their
castings
i
therefore
at
first
concluded
that
all
the
fine
mould
above
the
ruins
had
been
washed
down
from
the
upper
parts
of
the
field
but
we
shall
soon
see
that
this
conclusion
was
certainly
erroneous
though
much
fine
earth
is
known
to
be
washed
down
from
the
upper
part
of
the
field
in
its
present
ploughed
state
during
heavy
rains
although
the
concrete
floor
did
not
at
first
appear
to
have
been
anywhere
penetrated
by
worms
yet
by
the
next
morning
little
cakes
of
the
earth
had
been
lifted
up
by
worms
over
the
mouths
of
seven
burrows
which
passed
through
the
softer
parts
of
the
naked
concrete
or
between
the
interstices
of
the
tesseræ
on
the
third
morning
burrows
were
counted
and
by
suddenly
lifting
up
the
little
cakes
of
earth
four
worms
were
seen
in
the
act
of
quickly
retreating
two
castings
were
thrown
up
during
the
third
night
on
the
floor
and
these
were
of
large
size
the
season
was
not
favourable
for
the
full
activity
of
worms
and
the
weather
had
lately
been
hot
and
dry
so
that
most
of
the
worms
now
lived
at
a
considerable
depth
in
digging
the
two
trenches
many
open
burrows
and
some
worms
were
encountered
at
between
and
inches
beneath
the
surface
but
at
a
greater
depth
they
became
rare
one
worm
however
was
cut
through
at
and
another
at
inches
beneath
the
surface
a
fresh
burrow
was
also
met
with
at
a
depth
of
and
another
at
inches
at
greater
depths
than
this
neither
burrows
nor
worms
were
seen
as
i
wished
to
learn
how
many
worms
lived
beneath
the
floor
of
the
space
of
about
by
farrer
was
so
kind
as
to
make
observations
for
me
during
the
next
seven
weeks
by
which
time
the
worms
in
the
surrounding
country
were
in
full
activity
and
were
working
near
the
surface
it
is
very
improbable
that
worms
should
have
migrated
from
the
adjoining
field
into
the
small
space
of
the
atrium
after
the
superficial
mould
in
which
they
prefer
to
live
had
been
removed
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
the
burrows
and
the
castings
which
were
seen
here
during
the
ensuing
seven
weeks
were
the
work
of
the
former
inhabitants
of
the
space
i
will
now
give
a
few
extracts
from
farrer
s
notes
that
is
five
days
after
the
floor
had
been
cleared
on
the
previous
night
there
had
been
some
heavy
rain
which
washed
the
surface
clean
and
now
the
mouths
of
forty
burrows
were
counted
parts
of
the
concrete
were
seen
to
be
solid
and
had
never
been
penetrated
by
worms
and
here
the
lodged
of
worms
made
during
the
previous
night
could
be
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
floor
and
five
or
six
vermiform
castings
had
been
thrown
up
these
were
defaced
the
last
six
days
the
worms
have
not
been
active
though
many
castings
have
been
ejected
in
the
neighbouring
fields
but
on
this
day
the
earth
was
a
little
raised
over
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
or
castings
were
ejected
at
ten
fresh
points
these
were
defaced
it
should
be
understood
that
when
a
fresh
burrow
is
spoken
of
this
generally
means
only
that
an
old
burrow
has
been
farrer
was
repeatedly
struck
with
the
pertinacity
with
which
the
worms
their
old
burrows
even
when
no
earth
was
ejected
from
them
i
have
often
observed
the
same
fact
and
generally
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
are
protected
by
an
accumulation
of
pebbles
sticks
or
leaves
farrer
likewise
observed
that
the
worms
living
beneath
the
floor
of
the
atrium
often
collected
coarse
grains
of
sand
and
such
little
stones
as
they
could
find
round
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
soft
wet
weather
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
were
or
castings
were
ejected
at
points
these
were
all
defaced
fresh
holes
or
castings
all
defaced

only

the
number
of

on
the
surrounding
fields

now

record
of
the

holes
no
record
of
the
number
of

after
an
interval
of
three
years
farrer
at
my
request
again
looked
at
the
concrete
floor
and
found
the
worms
still
at
work
knowing
what
great
muscular
power
worms
possess
and
seeing
how
soft
the
concrete
was
in
many
parts
i
was
not
surprised
at
its
having
been
penetrated
by
their
burrows
but
it
is
a
more
surprising
fact
that
the
mortar
between
the
rough
stones
of
the
thick
walls
surrounding
the
rooms
was
found
by
farrer
to
have
been
penetrated
by
worms
on
august
that
is
five
days
after
the
ruins
had
been
exposed
he
observed
four
open
burrows
on
the
broken
summit
of
the
eastern
wall
w
in
fig
and
on
september
other
burrows
similarly
situated
were
seen
it
should
also
be
noted
that
in
the
perpendicular
side
of
the
trench
which
was
much
deeper
than
is
represented
in
fig
three
recent
burrows
were
seen
which
ran
obliquely
far
down
beneath
the
base
of
the
old
wall
we
thus
see
that
many
worms
lived
beneath
the
floor
and
the
walls
of
the
atrium
at
the
time
when
the
excavations
were
made
and
that
they
afterwards
almost
daily
brought
up
earth
to
the
surface
from
a
considerable
depth
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
to
doubt
that
worms
have
acted
in
this
manner
ever
since
the
period
when
the
concrete
was
sufficiently
decayed
to
allow
them
to
penetrate
it
and
even
before
that
period
they
would
have
lived
beneath
the
floor
as
soon
as
it
became
pervious
to
rain
so
that
the
soil
beneath
was
kept
damp
the
floor
and
the
walls
must
therefore
have
been
continually
undermined
and
fine
earth
must
have
been
heaped
on
them
during
many
centuries
perhaps
for
a
thousand
years
if
the
burrows
beneath
the
floor
and
walls
which
it
is
probable
were
formerly
as
numerous
as
they
now
are
had
not
collapsed
in
the
course
of
time
in
the
manner
formerly
explained
the
underlying
earth
would
have
been
riddled
with
passages
like
a
sponge
and
as
this
was
not
the
case
we
may
feel
sure
that
they
have
collapsed
the
inevitable
result
of
such
collapsing
during
successive
centuries
will
have
been
the
slow
subsidence
of
the
floor
and
of
the
walls
and
their
burial
beneath
the
accumulated
the
subsidence
of
a
floor
whilst
it
still
remains
nearly
horizontal
may
at
first
appear
improbable
but
the
case
presents
no
more
real
difficulty
than
that
of
loose
objects
strewed
on
the
surface
of
a
field
which
as
we
have
seen
become
buried
several
inches
beneath
the
surface
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
though
still
forming
a
horizontal
layer
parallel
to
the
surface
the
burial
of
the
paved
and
level
path
on
my
lawn
which
took
place
under
my
own
observation
is
an
analogous
case
even
those
parts
of
the
concrete
floor
which
the
worms
could
not
penetrate
would
almost
certainly
have
been
undermined
and
would
have
sunk
like
the
great
stones
at
leith
hill
place
and
stonehenge
for
the
soil
would
have
been
damp
beneath
them
but
the
rate
of
sinking
of
the
different
parts
would
not
have
been
quite
equal
and
the
floor
was
not
quite
level
the
foundations
of
the
boundary
walls
lie
as
shown
in
the
section
at
a
very
small
depth
beneath
the
surface
they
would
therefore
have
tended
to
subside
at
nearly
the
same
rate
as
the
floor
but
this
would
not
have
occurred
if
the
foundations
had
been
deep
as
in
the
case
of
some
other
roman
ruins
presently
to
be
described
finally
we
may
infer
that
a
large
part
of
the
fine
vegetable
mould
which
covered
the
floor
and
the
walls
of
this
villa
in
some
places
to
a
thickness
of
inches
was
brought
up
from
below
by
worms
from
facts
hereafter
to
be
given
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
some
of
the
finest
earth
thus
brought
up
will
have
been
washed
down
the
sloping
surface
of
the
field
during
every
heavy
shower
of
rain
if
this
had
not
occurred
a
greater
amount
of
mould
would
have
accumulated
over
the
ruins
than
that
now
present
but
beside
the
castings
of
worms
and
some
earth
brought
up
by
insects
and
some
accumulation
of
dust
much
fine
earth
will
have
been
washed
over
the
ruins
from
the
upper
parts
of
the
field
since
it
has
been
under
cultivation
and
from
over
the
ruins
to
the
lower
parts
of
the
slope
the
present
thickness
of
the
mould
being
the
resultant
of
these
several
agencies
i
may
here
append
a
modern
instance
of
the
sinking
of
a
pavement
communicated
to
me
in
by
ramsay
director
of
the
geological
survey
of
england
a
passage
without
a
roof
feet
in
length
by
feet
inches
in
width
led
from
his
house
into
the
garden
and
was
paved
with
slabs
of
portland
stone
several
of
these
slabs
were
inches
square
others
larger
and
some
a
little
smaller
this
pavement
had
subsided
about
inches
along
the
middle
of
the
passage
and
two
inches
on
each
side
as
could
be
seen
by
the
lines
of
cement
by
which
the
slabs
had
been
originally
joined
to
the
walls
the
pavement
had
thus
become
slightly
concave
along
the
middle
but
there
was
no
subsidence
at
the
end
close
to
the
house
ramsay
could
not
account
for
this
sinking
until
he
observed
that
castings
of
black
mould
were
frequently
ejected
along
the
lines
of
junction
between
the
slabs
and
these
castings
were
regularly
swept
away
the
several
lines
of
junction
including
those
with
the
lateral
walls
were
altogether
feet
inches
in
length
the
pavement
did
not
present
the
appearance
of
ever
having
been
renewed
and
the
house
was
believed
to
have
been
built
about
years
ago
considering
all
these
circumstances
ramsay
does
not
doubt
that
the
earth
brought
up
by
the
worms
since
the
pavement
was
first
laid
down
or
rather
since
the
decay
of
the
mortar
allowed
the
worms
to
burrow
through
it
and
therefore
within
a
much
shorter
time
than
the
years
has
sufficed
to
cause
the
sinking
of
the
pavement
to
the
above
amount
except
close
to
the
house
where
the
ground
beneath
would
have
been
kept
nearly
dry
beaulieu
abbey
abbey
was
destroyed
by
henry
and
there
now
remains
only
a
portion
of
the
southern
it
is
believed
that
the
king
had
most
of
the
stones
carried
away
for
building
a
castle
and
it
is
certain
that
they
have
been
removed
the
positions
of
the
nave
and
transepts
were
ascertained
not
long
ago
by
the
foundations
having
been
found
and
the
place
is
now
marked
by
stones
let
into
the
ground
where
the
abbey
formerly
stood
there
now
extends
a
smooth
surface
which
resembles
in
all
respects
the
rest
of
the
field
the
guardian
a
very
old
man
said
the
surface
had
never
been
levelled
in
his
time
in
the
year
the
duke
of
buccleuch
had
three
holes
dug
in
the
turf
within
a
few
yards
of
one
another
at
the
western
end
of
the
nave
and
the
old
tesselated
pavement
of
the
abbey
was
thus
discovered
these
holes
were
afterwards
surrounded
by
brickwork
and
protected
by
so
that
the
pavement
might
be
readily
inspected
and
preserved
when
my
son
william
examined
the
place
on
january
he
found
that
the
pavement
in
the
three
holes
lay
at
depths
of
and
inches
beneath
the
surrounding
surface
the
old
guardian
asserted
that
he
was
often
forced
to
remove
from
the
pavement
and
that
he
had
done
so
about
six
months
before
my
son
collected
all
from
one
of
the
holes
the
area
of
which
was
square
feet
and
they
weighed
ounces
assuming
that
this
amount
had
accumulated
in
six
months
the
accumulation
during
a
year
on
a
square
yard
would
be
pounds
which
though
a
large
amount
is
very
small
compared
with
what
as
we
have
seen
is
often
ejected
on
fields
and
commons
when
i
visited
the
abbey
on
june
the
old
man
said
that
he
had
cleared
out
the
holes
about
a
month
before
but
a
good
many
castings
had
since
been
ejected
i
suspect
that
he
imagined
that
he
swept
the
pavements
oftener
than
he
really
did
for
the
conditions
were
in
several
respects
very
unfavourable
for
the
accumulation
of
even
a
moderate
amount
of
castings
the
tiles
are
rather
large
about
inches
square
and
the
mortar
between
them
was
in
most
places
sound
so
that
the
worms
were
able
to
bring
up
earth
from
below
only
at
certain
points
the
tiles
rested
on
a
bed
of
concrete
and
the
castings
in
consequence
consisted
in
large
part
in
the
proportion
of
to
of
particles
of
mortar
grains
of
sand
little
fragments
of
rock
bricks
or
tile
and
such
substances
could
hardly
be
agreeable
and
certainly
not
nutritious
to
worms
my
son
dug
holes
in
several
places
within
the
former
walls
of
the
abbey
at
a
distance
of
several
yards
from
the
above
described
bricked
squares
he
did
not
find
any
tiles
though
these
are
known
to
occur
in
some
other
parts
but
he
came
in
one
spot
to
concrete
on
which
tiles
had
once
rested
the
fine
mould
beneath
the
turf
on
the
sides
of
the
several
holes
varied
in
thickness
from
only
to
inches
and
this
rested
on
a
layer
from
to
above
inches
in
thickness
consisting
of
fragments
of
mortar
and
with
the
interstices
compactly
filled
up
with
black
mould
in
the
surrounding
field
at
a
distance
of
yards
from
the
abbey
the
fine
vegetable
mould
was
inches
thick
we
may
conclude
from
these
facts
that
when
the
abbey
was
destroyed
and
the
stones
removed
a
layer
of
rubbish
was
left
over
the
whole
surface
and
that
as
soon
as
the
worms
were
able
to
penetrate
the
decayed
concrete
and
the
joints
between
the
tiles
they
slowly
filled
up
the
interstices
in
the
overlying
rubbish
with
their
castings
which
were
afterwards
accumulated
to
a
thickness
of
nearly
three
inches
over
the
whole
surface
if
we
add
to
this
latter
amount
the
mould
between
the
fragments
of
stones
some
five
or
six
inches
of
mould
must
have
been
brought
up
from
beneath
the
concrete
or
tiles
the
concrete
or
tiles
will
consequently
have
subsided
to
nearly
this
amount
the
bases
of
the
columns
of
the
aisles
are
now
buried
beneath
mould
and
turf
it
is
not
probable
that
they
can
have
been
undermined
by
worms
for
their
foundations
would
no
doubt
have
been
laid
at
a
considerable
depth
if
they
have
not
subsided
the
stones
of
which
the
columns
were
constructed
must
have
been
removed
from
beneath
the
former
level
of
the
floor
remains
of
a
large
roman
villa
were
discovered
here
in
on
ground
which
had
been
covered
with
wood
from
time
immemorial
no
suspicion
seems
ever
to
have
been
entertained
that
ancient
buildings
lay
buried
here
until
a
gamekeeper
in
digging
for
rabbits
encountered
some
remains
but
subsequently
the
tops
of
some
stone
walls
were
detected
in
parts
of
the
wood
projecting
a
little
above
the
surface
of
the
ground
most
of
the
coins
found
here
belonged
to
constans
who
died
and
the
constantine
family
my
sons
francis
and
horace
visited
the
place
in
november
for
the
sake
of
ascertaining
what
part
worms
may
have
played
in
the
burial
of
these
extensive
remains
but
the
circumstances
were
not
favourable
for
this
object
as
the
ruins
are
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
rather
steep
banks
down
which
earth
is
washed
during
rainy
weather
moreover
most
of
the
old
rooms
have
been
covered
with
roofs
for
the
protection
of
the
elegant
tesselated
pavements
a
few
facts
may
however
be
given
on
the
thickness
of
the
soil
over
these
ruins
close
outside
the
northern
rooms
there
is
a
broken
wall
the
summit
of
which
was
covered
by
inches
of
black
mould
and
in
a
hole
dug
on
the
outer
side
of
this
wall
where
the
ground
had
never
before
been
disturbed
black
mould
full
of
stones
inches
in
thickness
was
found
resting
on
the
undisturbed
of
yellow
clay
at
a
depth
of
inches
from
the
surface
a
pig
s
jaw
and
a
fragment
of
a
tile
were
found
when
the
excavations
were
first
made
some
large
trees
grew
over
the
ruins
and
the
stump
of
one
has
been
left
directly
over
a
near
the
for
the
sake
of
showing
the
thickness
of
the
superincumbent
soil
which
was
here
inches
in
one
small
room
which
after
being
cleared
out
had
not
been
roofed
over
my
sons
observed
the
hole
of
a
worm
passing
through
the
rotten
concrete
and
a
living
worm
was
found
within
the
concrete
in
another
open
room
were
seen
on
the
floor
over
which
some
earth
had
by
this
means
been
deposited
and
here
grass
now
grew
of
fine
roman
villa
was
discovered
here
in
and
by
the
end
of
october
no
less
than
chambers
had
been
more
or
less
cleared
a
coin
dated
was
found
my
son
william
visited
the
place
before
the
excavations
were
completed
and
he
informs
me
that
most
of
the
floors
were
at
first
covered
with
much
rubbish
and
fallen
stones
having
their
interstices
completely
filled
up
with
mould
abounding
as
the
workmen
said
with
worms
above
which
there
was
mould
without
any
stones
the
whole
mass
was
in
most
places
from
to
above
in
thickness
in
one
very
large
room
the
overlying
earth
was
only
in
thick
and
after
this
had
been
removed
so
many
castings
were
thrown
up
between
the
tiles
that
the
surface
had
to
be
almost
daily
swept
most
of
the
floors
were
fairly
level
the
tops
of
the
walls
were
covered
in
some
places
by
only
or
inches
of
soil
so
that
they
were
occasionally
struck
by
the
plough
but
in
other
places
they
were
covered
by
from
to
inches
of
soil
it
is
not
probable
that
these
walls
could
have
been
undermined
by
worms
and
subsided
as
they
rested
on
a
foundation
of
very
hard
red
sand
into
which
worms
could
hardly
burrow
the
mortar
however
between
the
stones
of
the
walls
of
a
hypocaust
was
found
by
my
son
to
have
been
penetrated
by
many
the
remains
of
this
villa
stand
on
land
which
slopes
at
an
angle
of
about
and
the
land
appears
to
have
been
long
cultivated
therefore
no
doubt
a
considerable
quantity
of
fine
earth
has
been
washed
down
from
the
upper
parts
of
the
field
and
has
largely
aided
in
the
burial
of
these
remains
ruins
of
this
small
roman
town
have
been
better
preserved
than
any
other
remains
of
the
kind
in
england
a
broken
wall
in
most
parts
from
to
feet
in
height
and
about
mile
in
compass
now
surrounds
a
space
of
about
acres
of
cultivated
land
on
which
a
and
a
church
stand
formerly
when
the
weather
was
dry
the
lines
of
the
buried
walls
could
be
traced
by
the
appearance
of
the
crops
and
recently
very
extensive
excavations
have
been
undertaken
by
the
duke
of
wellington
under
the
superintendence
of
the
late
rev
joyce
by
which
means
many
large
buildings
have
been
discovered
joyce
made
careful
coloured
sections
and
measured
the
thickness
of
each
bed
of
rubbish
whilst
the
excavations
were
in
progress
and
he
has
had
the
kindness
to
send
me
copies
of
several
of
them
when
my
sons
francis
and
horace
visited
these
ruins
he
accompanied
them
and
added
his
notes
to
theirs
joyce
estimates
that
the
town
was
inhabited
by
the
romans
for
about
three
centuries
and
no
doubt
much
matter
must
have
accumulated
within
the
walls
during
this
long
period
it
appears
to
have
been
destroyed
by
fire
and
most
of
the
stones
used
in
the
buildings
have
since
been
carried
away
these
circumstances
are
unfavourable
for
ascertaining
the
part
which
worms
have
played
in
the
burial
of
the
ruins
but
as
careful
sections
of
the
rubbish
overlying
an
ancient
town
have
seldom
or
never
before
been
made
in
england
i
will
give
copies
of
the
most
characteristic
portions
of
some
of
those
made
by
joyce
they
are
of
too
great
length
to
be
here
introduced
entire
an
east

west

made
across
a
room
in
the
basilica
now
called
the
hall
of
the
merchants
fig
the
hard
concrete
floor
still
covered
here
and
there
with
tesseræ
was
found
at
beneath
the
surface
of
the
field
which
was
here
level
on
the
floor
there
were
two
large
piles
of
charred
wood
one
alone
of
which
is
shown
in
the
part
of
the
section
here
given
this
pile
was
covered
by
a
thin
white
layer
of
decayed
stucco
or
plaster
above
which
was
a
mass
presenting
a
singularly
disturbed
appearance
of
broken
tiles
mortar
rubbish
and
fine
gravel
together
inches
in
thickness
joyce
believes
that
the
gravel
was
used
in
making
the
mortar
or
concrete
which
has
since
decayed
some
of
the
lime
probably
having
been
dissolved
the
disturbed
state
of
the
rubbish
may
have
been
due
to
its
having
been
searched
for
building
stones
this
bed
was
capped
by
fine
vegetable
mould
inches
in
thickness
from
these
facts
we
may
conclude
that
the
hall
was
burnt
down
and
that
much
rubbish
fell
on
the
floor
through
and
from
which
the
worms
slowly
brought
up

a

a

that

we
likewise
have
evidence
of

as
to
serve

us
were
observed
on
the
floors
of
several
of
the
rooms
in
one
of
which
the
tesselation
was
unusually
perfect
the
tesseræ
here
consisted
of
little
cubes
of
hard
sandstone
of
about
inch
several
of
which
were
loose
or
projected
slightly
above
the
general
level
one
or
occasionally
two
open
were
found
beneath
all
the
loose
tesseræ
worms
have
also
penetrated
the
old
walls
of
these
ruins
a
wall
which
had
just
been
exposed
to
view
during
the
excavations
then
in
progress
was
examined
it
was
built
of
large
flints
and
was
inches
in
thickness
it
appeared
sound
but
when
the
soil
was
removed
from
beneath
the
mortar
in
the
lower
part
was
found
to
be
so
much
decayed
that
the
flints
fell
apart
from
their
own
weight
here
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
at
a
depth
of
inches
beneath
the
old
floor
and
of
inches
beneath
the
surface
of
the
field
a
living
worm
was
found
and
the
mortar
was
penetrated
by
several
burrows
a
second
wall
was
exposed
to
view
for
the
first
time
and
an
open
burrow
was
seen
on
its
broken
summit
by
separating
the
flints
this
burrow
was
traced
far
down
in
the
interior
of
the
wall
but
as
some
of
the
flints
cohered
firmly
the
whole
mass
was
disturbed
in
pulling
down
the
wall
and
the
burrow
could
not
be
traced
to
the
bottom
the
foundations
of
a
third
wall
which
appeared
quite
sound
lay
at
a
depth
of
feet
beneath
one
of
the
floors
and
of
course
at
a
considerably
greater
depth
beneath
the
level
of
the
ground
a
large
flint
was
wrenched
out
of
the
wall
at
about
a
foot
from
the
base
and
this
required
much
force
as
the
mortar
was
sound
but
behind
the
flint
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
the
mortar
was
friable
and
here
there
were
joyce
and
my
sons
were
surprised
at
the
blackness
of
the
mortar
in
this
and
in
several
other
cases
and
at
the
presence
of
mould
in
the
interior
of
the
walls
some
may
have
been
placed
there
by
the
old
builders
instead
of
mortar
but
we
should
remember
that
worms
line
their
burrows
with
black
humus
moreover
open
spaces
would
almost
certainly
have
been
occasionally
left
between
the
large
irregular
flints
and
these
spaces
we
may
feel
sure
would
be
filled
up
by
the
worms
with
their
castings
as
soon
as
they
were
able
to
penetrate
the
wall
oozing
down
the
burrows
would
also
carry
fine
particles
into
every
crevice
joyce
was
at
first
very
sceptical
about
the
amount
of
work
which
i
attributed
to
worms
but
he
ends
his
notes
with
reference
to
the
wall
by
saying
this
case
caused
me
more
surprise
and
brought
more
conviction
to
me
than
any
other
i
should
have
said
and
did
say
that
it
was
quite
impossible
such
a
wall
could
have
been
penetrated
by
in
almost
all
the
rooms
the
pavement
has
sunk
considerably
especially
towards
the
middle
and
this
is
shown
in
the
three
following
sections
the
measurements
were
made
by
stretching
a
string
tightly
and
horizontally
over
the
floor
the
section
fig
was
taken
from
north
to
south
across
a
room
feet
inches
in
length
with
a
nearly
perfect
pavement
next
to
the
red
wooden
in
the
northern
half
the
subsidence
amounted
to
inches
beneath
the
level
of
the
floor
as
it
now
stands
close
to
the
walls
and
it
was
greater
in
the
northern
than
in
the
southern
half
but
according
to
joyce
the
entire
pavement
has
obviously
subsided
in
several
places
the
tesseræ
appeared
as
if
drawn
a
little
away
from
the
walls
whilst
in
other
places
they
were
still
in
close
contact
with
them
picture
fig
a
north
and
south
section
through
the
subsided
floor
of
a
corridor
in
fig
we
see
a
section
across
the
paved
floor
of
the
southern
corridor
or
ambulatory
of
a
quadrangle
in
an
excavation
made
near
the
the
floor
is
feet
inches
wide
and
the
walls
now
project
only
of
an
inch
above
its
level
the
field
which
was
in
pasture
here
sloped
from
north
to
south
at
an
angle
of
the
nature
of
the
ground
at
some
little
distance
on
each
side
of
the
corridor
is
shown
in
the
section
it
consisted
of
earth
full
of
stones
and
other
débris
capped
with
dark
vegetable
mould
which
was
thicker
on
the
lower
or
southern
than
on
the
northern
side
the
pavement
was
nearly
level
along
lines
parallel
to
the
but
had
sunk
in
the
middle
as
much
as
inches
a
small
room
at
no
great
distance
from
that
represented
in
fig
had
been
enlarged
by
the
roman
occupier
on
the
southern
side
by
an
addition
of
feet
inches
in
breadth
for
this
purpose
the
southern
wall
of
the
house
had
been
pulled
down
but
the
foundations
of
the
old
wall
had
been
left
buried
at
a
little
depth
beneath
the
pavement
of
the
enlarged
room
joyce
believes
that
this
buried
wall
must
have
been
built
before
the
reign
of
claudius
who
died
we
see
in
the
accompanying
section
fig
that
the
tesselated
pavement
has
subsided
to
a
less
degree
over
the
buried
wall
than
elsewhere
so
that
a
slight
convexity
or
protuberance
here
stretched
in
a
straight
line
across
the
room
this
led
to
a
hole
being
dug
and
the
buried
wall
was
thus
discovered
picture
fig
section
through
the
subsided
floor
we
see
in
these
three
sections
and
in
several
others
not
given
that
the
old
pavements
have
sunk
or
sagged
considerably
joyce
formerly
attributed
this
sinking
solely
to
the
slow
settling
of
the
ground
that
there
has
been
some
settling
is
highly
probable
and
it
may
be
seen
in
fig
that
the
pavement
for
a
width
of
feet
over
the
southern
enlargement
of
the
room
which
must
have
been
built
on
fresh
ground
has
sunk
a
little
more
than
on
the
old
northern
side
but
this
sinking
may
possibly
have
had
no
connection
with
the
enlargement
of
the
room
for
in
fig
one
half
of
the
pavement
has
subsided
more
than
the
other
half
without
any
assignable
cause
in
a
bricked
passage
to
joyce
s
own
house
laid
down
only
about
six
years
ago
the
same
kind
of
sinking
has
occurred
as
in
the
ancient
buildings
nevertheless
it
does
not
appear
probable
that
the
whole
amount
of
sinking
can
be
thus
accounted
for
the
roman
builders
excavated
the
ground
to
an
unusual
depth
for
the
foundations
of
their
walls
which
were
thick
and
solid
it
is
therefore
hardly
credible
that
they
should
have
been
careless
about
the
solidity
of
the
bed
on
which
their
tesselated
and
often
ornamented
pavements
were
laid
the
sinking
must
as
it
appears
to
me
be
attributed
in
chief
part
to
the
pavement
having
been
undermined
by
worms
which
we
know
are
still
at
work
even
joyce
at
last
admitted
that
this
could
not
have
failed
to
have
produced
a
considerable
effect
thus
also
the
large
quantity
of
fine
mould
overlying
the
pavements
can
be
accounted
for
the
presence
of
which
would
otherwise
be
inexplicable
my
sons
noticed
that
in
one
room
in
which
the
pavement
had
sagged
very
little
there
was
an
unusually
small
amount
of
overlying
mould
as
the
foundations
of
the
walls
generally
lie
at
a
considerable
depth
they
will
either
have
not
subsided
at
all
through
the
undermining
action
of
worms
or
they
will
have
subsided
much
less
than
the
floor
this
latter
result
would
follow
from
worms
not
often
working
deep
down
beneath
the
foundations
but
more
especially
from
the
walls
not
yielding
when
penetrated
by
worms
whereas
the
successively
formed
burrows
in
a
mass
of
earth
equal
to
one
of
the
walls
in
depth
and
thickness
would
have
collapsed
many
times
since
the
desertion
of
the
ruins
and
would
consequently
have
shrunk
or
subsided
as
the
walls
can
not
have
sunk
much
or
at
all
the
immediately
adjoining
pavement
from
adhering
to
them
will
have
been
prevented
from
subsiding
and
thus
the
present
curvature
of
the
pavement
is
intelligible
the
circumstance
which
has
surprised
me
most
with
respect
to
silchester
is
that
during
the
many
centuries
which
have
elapsed
since
the
old
buildings
were
deserted
the
vegetable
mould
has
not
accumulated
over
them
to
a
greater
thickness
than
that
here
observed
in
most
places
it
is
only
about
inches
in
thickness
but
in
some
places
or
even
more
inches
in
fig
it
is
given
as
inches
but
this
section
was
drawn
by
joyce
before
his
attention
was
particularly
called
to
this
subject
the
land
enclosed
within
the
old
walls
is
described
as
sloping
slightly
to
the
south
but
there
are
parts
which
according
to
joyce
are
nearly
level
and
it
appears
that
the
mould
is
here
generally
thicker
than
elsewhere
the
surface
slopes
in
other
parts
from
west
to
east
and
joyce
describes
one
floor
as
covered
at
the
western
end
by
rubbish
and
mould
to
a
thickness
of
inches
and
at
the
eastern
end
by
a
thickness
of
only
inches
a
very
slight
slope
suffices
to
cause
recent
castings
to
flow
downwards
during
heavy
rain
and
thus
much
earth
will
ultimately
reach
the
neighbouring
rills
and
streams
and
be
carried
away
by
this
means
the
absence
of
very
thick
beds
of
mould
over
these
ancient
ruins
may
as
i
believe
be
explained
moreover
most
of
the
land
here
has
long
been
ploughed
and
this
would
greatly
aid
the
washing
away
of
the
finer
earth
during
rainy
weather
the
nature
of
the
beds
immediately
beneath
the
vegetable
mould
in
some
of
the
sections
is
rather
perplexing
we
see
for
instance
in
the
section
of
an
excavation
in
a
grass
meadow
fig
which
sloped
from
north
to
south
at
an
angle
of
that
the
mould
on
the
upper
side
is
only
six
inches
and
on
the
lower
side
nine
inches
in
thickness
but
this
mould
lies
on
a
mass
inches
in
thickness
on
the
upper
side
of
dark
brown
mould
as
described
by
joyce
thickly
interspersed
with
small
pebbles
and
bits
of
tiles
which
present
a
corroded
or
worn
the
state
of
this
earth
is
like
that
of
a
field
which
has
long
been
ploughed
for
the
earth
thus
becomes
intermingled
with
stones
and
fragments
of
all
kinds
which
have
been
much
exposed
to
the
weather
if
during
the
course
of
many
centuries
this
grass
meadow
and
the
other
now
cultivated
fields
have
been
at
times
ploughed
and
at
other
times
left
as
pasture
the
nature
of
the
ground
in
the
above
section
is
rendered
intelligible
for
worms
will
continually
have
brought
up
fine
earth
from
below
which
will
have
been
stirred
up
by
the
plough
whenever
the
land
was
cultivated
but
after
a
time
a
greater
thickness
of
fine
earth
will
thus
have
been
accumulated
than
could
be
reached
by
the
plough
and
a
bed
like
the
mass
in
fig
will
have
been
formed
beneath
the
superficial
mould
which
latter
will
have
been
brought
to
the
surface
within
more
recent
times
and
have
been
well
sifted
by
the
worms
old
roman
city
of
uriconium
was
founded
in
the
early
part
of
the
second
century
if
not
before
this
date
and
it
was
destroyed
according
to
wright
probably
between
the
middle
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
century
the
inhabitants
were
massacred
and
skeletons
of
women
were
found
in
the
hypocausts
before
the
year
the
sole
remnant
of
the
city
above
ground
was
a
portion
of
a
massive
wall
about
in
height
the
surrounding
land
undulates
slightly
and
has
long
been
under
cultivation
it
had
been
noticed
that
the
ripened
prematurely
in
certain
narrow
lines
and
that
the
snow
remained
unmelted
in
certain
places
longer
than
in
others
these
appearances
led
as
i
was
informed
to
extensive
excavations
being
undertaken
the
foundations
of
many
large
buildings
and
several
streets
have
thus
been
exposed
to
view

space
enclosed
within
the
old
walls
is
an
irregular
oval
about
mile
in
length
many
of
the
stones
or
bricks
used
in
the
buildings
must
have
been
carried
away
but
the
hypocausts
baths
and
other
underground
buildings
were
found
tolerably
perfect
being
filled
with
stones
broken
tiles
rubbish
and

the
old
floors
of
various
rooms
were
covered
with
rubble
as
i
was
anxious
to
know
how
thick
the
mantle
of
mould
and
rubbish
was
which
had
so
long
concealed
these
ruins
i
applied
to
johnson
who
had
superintended
the
excavations
and
he
with
the
greatest
kindness
twice
visited
the
place
to
examine
it
in
reference
to
my
questions
and
had
many
trenches
dug
in
four
fields
which
had
hitherto
been
undisturbed
the
results
of
his
observations
are
given
in
the
following
table
he
also
sent
me
specimens
of
the
mould
and
answered
as
far
as
he
could

questions

upon

johnson
distinguished
as

the
earth
which
differed
more

less
abruptly
in
its
dark
colour
and
in
its
texture
from
the
underlying
sand
or
rubble
in
the
specimens
sent
to
me
the
mould
resembled
that
which
lies
immediately
beneath
the
turf
in
old
excepting
that
it
often
contained
small
stones
too
large
to
have
passed
through
the
bodies
of
worms
but
the
trenches
above
described
were
dug
in
fields
none
of
which
were
in
pasture
and
all
had
been
long
cultivated
bearing
in
mind
the
remarks
made
in
reference
to
silchester
on
the
effects
of
culture
combined
with
the
action
of
worms
in
bringing
up
the
finer
particles
to
the
surface
the
mould
as
so
designated
by
johnson
seems
fairly
well
to
deserve
its
name
its
thickness
where
there
was
no
causeway
floor
or
walls
beneath
was
greater
than
has
been
elsewhere
observed
namely
in
many
places
above
and
in
one
spot
above
ft
the
mould
was
thickest
on
and
close
to
the
nearly
level
summit
of
the
field
called
shop
leasows
and
in
a
small
adjoining
field
which
as
i
believe
is
of
nearly
the
same
height
one
side
of
the
former
field
slopes
at
an
angle
of
rather
above
and
i
should
have
expected
that
the
mould
from
being
washed
down
during
heavy
rain
would
have
been
thicker
in
the
lower
than
in
the
upper
part
but
this
was
not
the
case
in
two
out
of
the
three
trenches
here
dug
in
many
places
where
streets
ran
beneath
the
surface
or
where
old
buildings
stood
the
mould
was
only
inches
in
thickness
and
johnson
was
surprised
that
in
ploughing
the
land
the
ruins
had
never
been
struck
by
the
plough
as
far
as
he
had
heard
he
thinks
that
when
the
land
was
first
cultivated
the
old
walls
were
perhaps
intentionally
pulled
down
and
that
hollow
places
were
filled
up
this
may
have
been
the
case
but
if
after
the
desertion
of
the
city
the
land
was
left
for
many
centuries
uncultivated
worms
would
have
brought
up
enough
fine
earth
to
have
covered
the
ruins
completely
that
is
if
they
had
subsided
from
having
been
undermined
the
foundations
of
some
of
the
walls
for
instance
those
of
the
portion
still
standing
about
feet
above
the
ground
and
those
of
the
marketplace
lie
at
the
extraordinary
depth
of
feet
but
it
is
highly
improbable
that
the
foundations
were
generally
so
deep
the
mortar
employed
in
the
buildings
must
have
been
excellent
for
it
is
still
in
parts
extremely
hard
wherever
walls
of
any
height
have
been
exposed
to
view
they
are
as
johnson
believes
still
perpendicular
the
walls
with
such
deep
foundations
can
not
have
been
undermined
by
worms
and
therefore
can
not
have
subsided
as
appears
to
have
occurred
at
abinger
and
silchester
hence
it
is
very
difficult
to
account
for
their
being
now
completely
covered
with
earth
but
how
much
of
this
covering
consists
of
vegetable
mould
and
how
much
of
rubble
i
do
not
know
the
with
the
foundations
at
a
depth
of
feet
was
covered
up
as
johnson
believes
by
between
and
inches
of
earth
the
tops
of
the
walls
of
a
caldarium
or
bath
feet
in
depth
were
likewise
covered
up
with
nearly
feet
of
earth
the
summit
of
an
arch
leading
into
an
feet
in
depth
was
covered
up
with
not
more
than
inches
of
earth
whenever
a
building
which
has
not
subsided
is
covered
with
earth
we
must
suppose
either
that
the
upper
layers
of
stone
have
been
at
some
time
carried
away
by
man
or
that
earth
has
since
been
washed
down
during
heavy
rain
or
blown
down
during
storms
from
the
adjoining
land
and
this
would
be
especially
apt
to
occur
where
the
land
has
long
been
cultivated
in
the
above
cases
the
adjoining
land
is
somewhat
higher
than
the
three
specified
sites
as
far
as
i
can
judge
by
maps
and
from
information
given
me
by
johnson
if
however
a
great
pile
of
broken
stones
mortar
plaster
timber
and
ashes
fell
over
the
remains
of
any
building
their
disintegration
in
the
course
of
time
and
the
sifting
action
of
worms
would
ultimately
conceal
the
whole
beneath
fine
earth
cases
given
in
this
chapter
show
that
worms
have
played
a
considerable
part
in
the
burial
and
concealment
of
several
roman
and
other
old
buildings
in
england
but
no
doubt
the
washing
down
of
soil
from
the
neighbouring
higher
lands
and
the
deposition
of
dust
have
together
aided
largely
in
the
work
of
concealment
dust
would
be
apt
to
accumulate
wherever
old
walls
projected
a
little
above
the
then
existing
surface
and
thus
afforded
some
shelter
the
floors
of
the
old
rooms
halls
and
passages
have
generally
sunk
partly
from
the
settling
of
the
ground
but
chiefly
from
having
been
undermined
by
worms
and
the
sinking
has
commonly
been
greater
in
the
middle
than
near
the
walls
the
walls
themselves
whenever
their
foundations
do
not
lie
at
a
great
depth
have
been
penetrated
and
undermined
by
worms
and
have
consequently
subsided
the
unequal
subsidence
thus
caused
probably
explains
the
great
cracks
which
may
be
seen
in
many
ancient
walls
as
well
as
their
inclination
from
the
perpendicular

of

evidence
of
the
amount
of
denudation
which
the
land
has
deposition
of

its
dark
colour
and

largely
due
to
the
action
of
disintegration
of
rocks
by
the

generated
within

by

rounded
the
triturating
power
of
worms
not
quite
insignificant
under
a
geological
point
of
view
no
one
doubts
that
our
world
at
one
time
consisted
of
crystalline
rocks
and
that
it
is
to
their
disintegration
through
the
action
of
air
water
changes
of
temperature
rivers
waves
of
the
sea
earthquakes
and
volcanic
outbursts
that
we
owe
our
sedimentary
formations
these
after
being
consolidated
and
sometimes
recrystallized
have
often
been
again
disintegrated
denudation
means
the
removal
of
such
disintegrated
matter
to
a
lower
level
of
the
many
striking
results
due
to
the
modern
progress
of
geology
there
are
hardly
any
more
striking
than
those
which
relate
to
denudation
it
was
long
ago
seen
that
there
must
have
been
an
immense
amount
of
denudation
but
until
the
successive
formations
were
carefully
mapped
and
measured
no
one
fully
realised
how
great
was
the
amount
one
of
the
first
and
most
remarkable
memoirs
ever
published
on
this
subject
was
that
by
ramsay
who
in
showed
that
in
wales
from
to
feet
in
thickness
of
solid
rock
had
been
stripped
off
large
tracks
of
country
perhaps
the
plainest
evidence
of
great
denudation
is
afforded
by
faults
or
cracks
which
extend
for
many
miles
across
certain
districts
with
the
strata
on
one
side
raised
even
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
corresponding
strata
on
the
opposite
side
and
yet
there
is
not
a
vestige
of
this
gigantic
displacement
visible
on
the
surface
of
the
land
a
huge
pile
of
rock
has
been
planed
away
on
one
side
and
not
a
remnant
left
until
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
most
geologists
thought
that
the
waves
of
the
sea
were
the
chief
agents
in
the
work
of
denudation
but
we
may
now
feel
sure
that
air
and
rain
aided
by
streams
and
rivers
are
much
more
powerful
agents
is
if
we
consider
the
whole
area
of
the
land
the
long
lines
of
escarpment
which
stretch
across
several
parts
of
england
were
formerly
considered
to
be
undoubtedly
ancient
but
we
now
know
that
they
stand
up
above
the
general
surface
merely
from
resisting
air
rain
and
frost
better
than
the
adjoining
formations
it
has
rarely
been
the
good
fortune
of
a
geologist
to
bring
conviction
to
the
minds
of
his
on
a
disputed
point
by
a
single
memoir
but
whitaker
of
the
geological
survey
of
england
was
so
fortunate
when
in
he
published
his
paper
on
denudation
and
on
cliffs
and
escarpments
of
the
before
this
paper
appeared
tylor
had
adduced
important
evidence
on
denudation
by
showing
that
the
amount
of
matter
brought
down
by
rivers
must
infallibly
lower
the
level
of
their
drainage
basins
by
many
feet
in
no
immense
lapse
of
time
this
line
of
argument
has
since
been
followed
up
in
the
most
interesting
manner
by
archibald
geikie
croll
and
others
in
a
series
of
valuable
memoirs
for
the
sake
of
those
who
have
never
attended
to
this
subject
a
single
instance
may
be
here
given
namely
that
of
the
mississippi
which
is
chosen
because
the
amount
of
sediment
brought
down
by
this
great
river
has
been
investigated
with
especial
care
by
order
of
the
united
states
government
the
result
is
as
croll
shows
that
the
mean
level
of
its
enormous
area
of
drainage
must
be
lowered
of
a
foot
annually
or
foot
in
years
consequently
taking
the
best
estimate
of
the
mean
height
of
the
north
american
continent
viz
feet
and
looking
to
the
future
the
whole
of
the
great
mississippi
basin
will
be
washed
away
and
brought
down
to
the
in
less
than
years
if
no
elevation
of
the
land
takes
some
rivers
carry
down
much
more
sediment
relatively
to
their
size
and
some
much
less
than
the
mississippi
disintegrated
matter
is
carried
away
by
the
wind
as
well
as
by
running
water
during
volcanic
outbursts
much
rock
is
triturated
and
is
thus
widely
dispersed
and
in
all
arid
countries
the
wind
plays
an
important
part
in
the
removal
of
such
matter
sand
also
wears
down
the
hardest
rocks
i
have
shown
that
during
four
months
of
the
year
a
large
quantity
of
dust
is
blown
from
the
shores
of
africa
and
falls
on
the
atlantic
over
a
space
of
miles
in
latitude
and
for
a
distance
of
from
to
miles
from
the
coast
but
dust
has
been
seen
to
fall
at
a
distance
of
miles
from
the
shores
of
africa
during
a
stay
of
three
weeks
at
jago
in
the
cape
verde
archipelago
the
atmosphere
was
almost
always
hazy
and
extremely
fine
dust
coming
from
africa
was
continually
falling
in
some
of
this
dust
which
fell
in
the
open
ocean
at
a
distance
of
between
and
miles
from
the
african
coast
there
were
many
particles
of
stone
about
of
an
inch
square
nearer
to
the
coast
the
water
has
been
seen
to
be
so
much
discoloured
by
the
falling
dust
that
a
sailing
vessel
left
a
track
behind
her
in
countries
like
the
cape
verde
archipelago
where
it
seldom
rains
and
there
are
no
frosts
the
solid
rock
nevertheless
disintegrates
and
in
conformity
with
the
views
lately
advanced
by
a
distinguished
belgian
geologist
de
koninck
such
disintegration
may
be
attributed
in
chief
part
to
the
action
of
the
carbonic
and
nitric
acids
together
with
the
nitrates
and
nitrites
of
ammonia
dissolved
in
the
dew
in
all
humid
even
moderately
humid
countries
worms
aid
in
the
work
of
denudation
in
several
ways
the
vegetable
mould
which
covers
as
with
a
mantle
the
surface
of
the
land
has
all
passed
many
times
through
their
bodies
mould
differs
in
appearance
from
the
subsoil
only
in
its
dark
colour
and
in
the
absence
of
fragments
or
particles
of
stone
when
such
are
present
in
the
subsoil
larger
than
those
which
can
pass
through
the
alimentary
canal
of
a
worm
this
sifting
of
the
soil
is
aided
as
has
already
been
remarked
by
burrowing
animals
of
many
kinds
especially
by
ants
in
countries
where
the
summer
is
long
and
dry
the
mould
in
protected
places
must
be
largely
increased
by
dust
blown
from
other
and
more
exposed
places
for
instance
the
quantity
of
dust
sometimes
blown
over
the
plains
of
la
plata
where
there
are
no
solid
rocks
is
so
great
that
during
the
gran
seco
to
the
appearance
of
the
land
which
is
here
unenclosed
was
so
completely
changed
that
the
inhabitants
could
not
recognise
the
limits
of
their
own
estates
and
endless
lawsuits
arose
immense
quantities
of
dust
are
likewise
blown
about
in
egypt
and
in
the
south
of
france
in
china
as
richthofen
maintains
beds
appearing
like
fine
sediment
several
hundred
feet
in
thickness
and
extending
over
an
enormous
area
owe
their
origin
to
dust
blown
from
the
high
lands
of
central
asia
in
humid
countries
like
great
britain
as
long
as
the
land
remains
in
its
natural
state
clothed
with
vegetation
the
mould
in
any
one
place
can
hardly
be
much
increased
by
dust
but
in
its
present
condition
the
fields
near
high
roads
where
there
is
much
traffic
must
receive
a
considerable
amount
of
dust
and
when
fields
are
harrowed
during
dry
and
windy
weather
clouds
of
dust
may
be
seen
to
be
blown
away
but
in
all
these
cases
the
is
merely
transported
from
one
place
to
another
the
dust
which
falls
so
thickly
within
our
houses
consists
largely
of
organic
matter
and
if
spread
over
the
land
would
in
time
decay
and
disappear
almost
entirely
it
appears
however
from
recent
observations
on
the
of
the
arctic
regions
that
some
little
meteoric
dust
of
extra
mundane
origin
is
continually
falling
the
dark
colour
of
ordinary
mould
is
obviously
due
to
the
presence
of
decaying
organic
matter
which
however
is
present
in
but
small
quantities
the
loss
of
weight
which
mould
suffers
when
heated
to
redness
seems
to
be
in
large
part
due
to
water
in
combination
being
dispelled
in
one
sample
of
fertile
mould
the
amount
of
organic
matter
was
ascertained
to
be
only
per
cent
in
some
artificially
prepared
soil
it
was
as
much
as
per
and
in
the
famous
black
soil
of
russia
from
to
even
per
cent
in
formed
exclusively
by
the
decay
of
leaves
the
amount
is
much
greater
and
in
peat
the
carbon
alone
sometimes
amounts
to
per
cent
but
with
these
latter
cases
we
are
not
here
concerned
the
carbon
in
the
soil
tends
gradually
to
oxidise
and
to
disappear
except
where
water
accumulates
and
the
climate
is
cool
so
that
in
the
oldest
there
is
no
great
excess
of
organic
matter
notwithstanding
the
continued
decay
of
the
roots
and
the
underground
stems
of
plants
and
the
occasional
addition
of
manure
the
disappearance
of
the
organic
matter
from
mould
is
probably
much
aided
by
its
being
brought
again
and
again
to
the
surface
in
the
castings
of
worms
worms
on
the
other
hand
add
largely
to
the
organic
matter
in
the
soil
by
the
astonishing
number
of
leaves
which
they
draw
into
their
burrows
to
a
depth
of
or
inches
they
do
this
chiefly
for
obtaining
food
but
partly
for
closing
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
and
for
lining
the
upper
part
the
leaves
which
they
consume
are
moistened
torn
into
small
shreds
partially
digested
and
intimately
commingled
with
earth
and
it
is
this
process
which
gives
to
vegetable
mould
its
uniform
dark
tint
it
is
known
that
various
kinds
of
acids
are
generated
by
the
decay
of
vegetable
matter
and
from
the
contents
of
the
intestines
of
worms
and
from
their
castings
being
acid
it
seems
probable
that
the
process
of
digestion
induces
an
analogous
chemical
change
in
the
swallowed
triturated
and
leaves
the
large
quantity
of
carbonate
of
lime
secreted
by
the
calciferous
glands
apparently
serves
to
neutralise
the
acids
thus
generated
for
the
digestive
fluid
of
worms
will
not
act
unless
it
be
alkaline
as
the
contents
of
the
upper
part
of
their
intestines
are
acid
the
acidity
can
hardly
be
due
to
the
presence
of
uric
acid
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
the
acids
in
the
alimentary
canal
of
worms
are
formed
during
the
digestive
process
and
that
probably
they
are
nearly
of
the
same
nature
as
those
in
ordinary
mould
or
humus
the
latter
are
well
known
to
have
the
power
of
or
dissolving
of
iron
as
may
be
seen
wherever
peat
overlies
red
sand
or
where
a
rotten
root
penetrates
such
sand
now
i
kept
some
worms
in
a
pot
filled
with
very
fine
reddish
sand
consisting
of
minute
particles
of
silex
coated
with
the
red
oxide
of
iron
and
the
burrows
which
the
worms
made
through
this
sand
were
lined
or
coated
in
the
usual
manner
with
their
castings
formed
of
the
sand
mingled
with
their
intestinal
secretions
and
the
refuse
of
the
digested
leaves
and
this
sand
had
almost
wholly
lost
its
red
colour
when
small
portions
of
it
were
placed
under
the
microscope
most
of
the
grains
were
seen
to
be
transparent
and
colourless
owing
to
the
dissolution
of
the
oxide
whilst
almost
all
the
grains
taken
from
other
parts
of
the
pot
were
coated
with
the
oxide
acetic
acid
produced
hardly
any
effect
on
his
sand
and
even
hydrochloric
nitric
and
sulphuric
acids
diluted
as
in
the
pharmacopoeia
produced
less
effect
than
did
the
acids
in
the
intestines
of
the
worms
a
julien
has
lately
collected
all
the
extant
information
about
the
acids
generated
in
humus
which
according
to
some
chemists
amount
to
more
than
a
dozen
different
kinds
these
acids
as
well
as
their
acid
salts
in
combination
with
potash
soda
and
ammonia
act
energetically
on
carbonate
of
lime
and
on
the
oxides
of
iron
it
is
also
known
that
some
of
these
acids
which
were
called
long
ago

probably
afford
some
aid
for
johnson
informs
me
that
by
nessler
s
test
he
found
per
cent
of
ammonia
in
their
castings
it
may
be
here
added
that
i
have
recently
been
informed
by
gilbert
that
several
square
yards
on
his
lawn
were
swept
clean
and
after
two
or
three
weeks
all
the
on
the
space
were
collected
and
dried
these
were
found
to
contain
of
nitrogen
this
is
from
two
to
three
times
as
much
as
we
find
in
our
ordinary
arable
more
than
in
our
ordinary
pasture
but
less
than
in
rich
mould
supposing
a
quantity
of
castings
equal
to
tons
in
the
dry
state
were
annually
deposited
on
an
acre
this
would
represent
a
manuring
of
lbs
of
nitrogen
per
acre
per
annum
and
this
is
very
much
more
than
the
amount
of
nitrogen
in
the
annual
yield
of
hay
per
acre
if
raised
without
any
nitrogenous
manure
obviously
so
far
as
the
nitrogen
in
the
castings
is
derived
from
or
from
it
is
not
a
gain
to
the
latter
but
so
far
as
it
is
derived
from
below
it
is
a
the
several
which
appear
as
we
have
just
seen
to
be
generated
within
the
bodies
of
worms
during
the
digestive
process
and
their
acid
salts
play
a
highly
important
part
according
to
the
recent
observations
of
julien
in
the
disintegration
of
various
kinds
of
rocks
it
has
long
been
known
that
the
carbonic
acid
and
no
doubt
nitric
and
nitrous
acids
which
are
present
in
act
in
like
manner
there
is
also
a
great
excess
of
carbonic
acid
in
all
soils
especially
in
rich
soils
and
this
is
dissolved
by
the
water
in
the
ground
the
living
roots
of
plants
moreover
as
sachs
and
others
have
shown
quickly
corrode
and
leave
their
impressions
on
polished
slabs
of
marble
dolomite
and
phosphate
of
lime
they
will
attack
even
basalt
and
sandstone
but
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
agencies
which
are
wholly
independent
of
the
action
of
worms
the
combination
of
any
acid
with
a
base
is
much
facilitated
by
agitation
as
fresh
surfaces
are
thus
continually
brought
into
contact
this
will
be
thoroughly
effected
with
the
particles
of
stone
and
earth
in
the
intestines
of
worms
during
the
digestive
process
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
entire
mass
of
the
mould
over
every
field
passes
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
through
their
alimentary
canals
moreover
as
the
old
burrows
slowly
collapse
and
as
fresh
castings
are
continually
brought
to
the
surface
the
whole
superficial
layer
of
mould
slowly
revolves
or
circulates
and
the
friction
of
the
particles
one
with
another
will
rub
off
the
finest
films
of
disintegrated
matter
as
soon
as
they
are
formed
through
these
several
means
minute
fragments
of
rocks
of
many
kinds
and
mere
particles
in
the
soil
will
be
continually
exposed
to
chemical
decomposition
and
thus
the
amount
of
soil
will
tend
to
increase
as
worms
line
their
burrows
with
their
castings
and
as
the
burrows
penetrate
to
a
depth
of
or
or
even
more
feet
some
small
amount
of
the
will
be
carried
far
down
and
will
there
act
on
the
underlying
rocks
and
fragments
of
rock
thus
the
thickness
of
the
soil
if
none
be
removed
from
the
surface
will
steadily
though
slowly
tend
to
increase
but
the
accumulation
will
after
a
time
delay
the
disintegration
of
the
underlying
rocks
and
of
the
more
deeply
seated
particles
for
the
which
are
generated
chiefly
in
the
upper
layer
of
vegetable
mould
are
extremely
unstable
compounds
and
are
liable
to
decomposition
before
they
reach
any
considerable
depth
a
thick
bed
of
overlying
soil
will
also
check
the
downward
extension
of
great
fluctuations
of
temperature
and
in
cold
countries
will
check
the
powerful
action
of
frost
the
free
access
of
air
will
likewise
be
excluded
from
these
several
causes
disintegration
would
be
almost
arrested
if
the
overlying
mould
were
to
increase
much
in
thickness
owing
to
none
or
little
being
removed
from
the
surface
in
my
own
immediate
neighbourhood
we
have
a
curious
proof
how
effectually
a
few
feet
of
clay
checks
some
change
which
goes
on
in
flints
lying
freely
exposed
for
the
large
ones
which
have
lain
for
some
time
on
the
surface
of
ploughed
fields
can
not
be
used
for
building
they
will
not
cleave
properly
and
are
said
by
the
workmen
to
be
rotten
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
obtain
flints
for
building
purposes
from
the
bed
of
red
clay
overlying
the
chalk
the
residue
of
its
dissolution
by
or
from
the
chalk
itself
not
only
do
worms
aid
directly
in
the
chemical
disintegration
of
rocks
but
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
they
likewise
act
in
a
direct
and
mechanical
manner
on
the
smaller
particles
all
the
species
which
swallow
earth
are
furnished
with
gizzards
and
these
are
lined
with
so
thick
a
chitinous
membrane
that
perrier
speaks
of
it
as
une
véritable
the
gizzard
is
surrounded
by
powerful
transverse
muscles
which
according
to
claparède
are
about
ten
times
as
thick
as
the
longitudinal
ones
and
perrier
saw
them
contracting
energetically
worms
belonging
to
one
genus
digaster
have
two
distinct
but
quite
similar
gizzards
and
in
another
genus
moniligaster
the
second
gizzard
consists
of
four
pouches
one
succeeding
the
other
so
that
it
may
almost
be
said
to
have
five
gizzards
in
the
same
manner
as
gallinaceous
and
struthious
birds
swallow
stones
to
aid
in
the
trituration
of
their
food
so
it
appears
to
be
with
terricolous
worms
the
gizzards
of
of
our
common
worms
were
opened
and
in
of
them
small
stones
or
grains
of
sand
sometimes
together
with
the
hard
calcareous
concretions
formed
within
the
anterior
calciferous
glands
were
found
and
in
two
others
concretions
alone
in
the
gizzards
of
the
remaining
worms
there
were
no
stones
but
some
of
these
were
not
real
exceptions
as
the
gizzards
were
opened
late
in
the
autumn
when
the
worms
had
ceased
to
feed
and
their
gizzards
were
quite
empty
when
worms
make
their
burrows
through
earth
abounding
with
little
stones
no
doubt
many
will
be
unavoidably
swallowed
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
this
fact
accounts
for
the
frequency
with
which
stones
and
sand
are
found
in
their
gizzards
for
beads
of
glass
and
fragments
of
brick
and
of
hard
tiles
were
scattered
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
pots
in
which
worms
were
kept
and
had
already
made
their
burrows
and
very
many
of
these
beads
and
fragments
were
picked
up
and
swallowed
by
the
worms
for
they
were
found
in
their
castings
intestines
and
gizzards
they
even
swallowed
the
coarse
red
dust
formed
by
the
pounding
of
the
tiles
nor
can
it
be
supposed
that
they
mistook
the
beads
and
fragments
for
food
for
we
have
seen
that
their
taste
is
delicate
enough
to
distinguish
between
different
kinds
of
leaves
it
is
therefore
manifest
that
they
swallow
hard
objects
such
as
bits
of
stone
beads
of
glass
and
angular
fragments
of
bricks
or
tiles
for
some
special
purpose
and
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
this
is
to
aid
their
gizzards
in
crushing
and
grinding
the
earth
which
they
so
largely
consume
that
such
hard
objects
are
not
necessary
for
crushing
leaves
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
certain
species
which
live
in
mud
or
water
and
feed
on
dead
or
living
vegetable
matter
but
which
do
not
swallow
earth
are
not
provided
with
gizzards
and
therefore
can
not
have
the
power
of
utilising
stones
during
the
grinding
process
the
particles
of
earth
must
be
rubbed
against
one
another
and
between
the
stones
and
the
tough
lining
membrane
of
the
gizzard
the
softer
particles
will
thus
suffer
some
attrition
and
will
perhaps
even
be
crushed
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
the
appearance
of
freshly
ejected
castings
for
these
often
reminded
me
of
the
appearance
of
paint
which
has
just
been
ground
by
a
workman
between
two
flat
stones

as
the
amount
of
trituration
which
the
particles
of
earth
undergo
in
the
gizzards
of
worms
possesses
some
interest
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
i
endeavoured
to
obtain
evidence
on
this
head
by
carefully
examining
many
of
the
fragments
which
had
passed
through
their
alimentary
canals
with
worms
living
in
a
state
of
nature
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
know
how
much
the
fragments
may
have
been
worn
before
they
were
swallowed
it
is
however
clear
that
worms
do
not
habitually
select
already
rounded
particles
for
sharply
angular
bits
of
flint
and
of
other
hard
rocks
were
often
found
in
their
gizzards
or
intestines
on
three
occasions
sharp
spines
from
the
stems
of
were
thus
found
worms
kept
in
confinement
repeatedly
swallowed
angular
fragments
of
hard
tile
coal
cinders
and
even
the
sharpest
fragments
of
glass
gallinaceous
and
struthious
birds
retain
the
same
stones
in
their
gizzards
for
a
long
time
which
thus
become
well
rounded
but
this
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case
with
worms
judging
from
the
large
number
of
the
fragments
of
tiles
glass
beads
stones
commonly
found
in
their
castings
and
intestines
so
that
unless
the
same
fragments
were
to
pass
repeatedly
through
their
gizzards
visible
signs
of
attrition
in
the
fragments
could
hardly
be
expected
except
perhaps
in
the
case
of
very
soft
stones
i
will
now
give
such
evidence
of
attrition
as
i
have
been
able
to
collect
in
the
gizzards
of
some
worms
dug
out
of
a
thin
bed
of
mould
over
the
chalk
there
were
many
small
fragments
of
chalk
and
two
fragments
of
the
shells
of
a
as
ascertained
by
their
microscopical
structure
which
latter
were
not
only
rounded
but
somewhat
polished
the
calcareous
concretions
formed
in
the
calciferous
glands
which
are
often
found
in
their
gizzards
intestines
and
occasionally
in
their
castings
when
of
large
size
sometimes
appeared
to
have
been
rounded
but
with
all
calcareous
bodies
the
rounded
appearance
may
be
partly
or
wholly
due
to
their
corrosion
by
carbonic
acid
and
the
in
the
gizzards
of
several
worms
collected
in
my
kitchen
garden
near
a
hothouse
eight
little
fragments
of
cinders
were
found
and
of
these
six
appeared
more
or
less
rounded
as
were
two
bits
of
brick
but
some
other
bits
were
not
at
all
rounded
a
near
abinger
hall
had
been
covered
seven
years
before
with
to
the
depth
of
about
inches
turf
had
grown
over
this
rubbish
on
both
sides
of
the
road
for
a
width
of
inches
and
on
this
turf
there
were
innumerable
castings
some
of
them
were
coloured
of
a
uniform
red
owing
to
the
presence
of
much
and
they
contained
many
particles
of
brick
and
of
hard
mortar
from
to
mm
in
diameter
most
of
which
were
plainly
rounded
but
all
these
particles
may
have
been
rounded
before
they
were
protected
by
the
turf
and
were
swallowed
like
those
on
the
bare
parts
of
the
road
which
were
much
worn
a
hole
in
a
had
been
filled
up
with
at
the
same
time
seven
years
ago
and
was
now
covered
with
turf
and
here
the
castings
contained
very
many
particles
of
brick
all
more
or
less
rounded
and
this
after
being
shot
into
the
hole
could
not
have
undergone
any
attrition
again
old
bricks
very
little
broken
together
with
fragments
of
mortar
were
laid
down
to
form
walks
and
were
then
covered
with
from
to
inches
of
gravel
six
little
fragments
of
brick
were
extracted
from
castings
collected
on
these
walks
three
of
which
were
plainly
worn
there
were
also
very
many
particles
of
hard
mortar
about
half
of
which
were
well
rounded
and
it
is
not
credible
that
these
could
have
suffered
so
much
corrosion
from
the
action
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
course
of
only
seven
years
much
better
evidence
of
the
attrition
of
hard
objects
in
the
gizzards
of
worms
is
afforded
by
the
state
of
the
small
fragments
of
tiles
or
bricks
and
of
concrete
in
the
castings
thrown
up
where
ancient
buildings
once
stood
as
all
the
mould
covering
a
field
passes
every
few
years
through
the
bodies
of
worms
the
same
small
fragments
will
probably
be
swallowed
and
brought
to
the
surface
many
times
in
the
course
of
centuries
it
should
be
premised
that
in
the
several
following
cases
the
finer
matter
was
first
washed
away
from
the
castings
and
then
the
particles
of
bricks
tiles
and
concrete
were
collected
without
any
selection
and
were
afterwards
examined
now
in
the
castings
ejected
between
the
tesseræ
on
one
of
the
buried
floors
of
the
roman
villa
at
abinger
there
were
many
particles
from
to
mm
in
diameter
of
tiles
and
concrete
which
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
with
the
naked
eye
or
through
a
strong
lens
and
doubt
for
a
moment
that
they
had
almost
all
undergone
much
attrition
i
speak
thus
after
having
examined
small
pebbles
formed
from
roman
bricks
which
henri
de
saussure
had
the
kindness
to
send
me
and
which
he
had
extracted
from
sand
and
gravel
beds
deposited
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
geneva
at
a
former
period
when
the
water
stood
at
about
two
metres
above
its
present
level
the
smallest
of
these
pebbles
of
brick
from
geneva
resembled
closely
many
of
those
extracted
from
the
gizzards
of
worms
but
the
larger
ones
were
somewhat
smoother
four
castings
found
on
the
recently
uncovered
tesselated
floor
of
the
great
room
in
the
roman
villa
at
brading
contained
many
particles
of
tile
or
brick
of
mortar
and
of
hard
white
cement
and
the
majority
of
these
appeared
plainly
worn
the
particles
of
mortar
however
seemed
to
have
suffered
more
corrosion
than
attrition
for
grains
of
silex
often
projected
from
their
surfaces
castings
from
within
the
nave
of
beaulieu
abbey
which
was
destroyed
by
henry
were
collected
from
a
level
expanse
of
turf
overlying
the
buried
tesselated
pavement
through
which
passed
and
these
castings
contained
innumerable
particles
of
tiles
and
bricks
of
concrete
and
cement
the
majority
of
which
had
manifestly
undergone
some
or
much
attrition
there
were
also
many
minute
flakes
of
a
micaceous
slate
the
points
of
which
were
rounded
if
the
above
supposition
that
in
all
these
cases
the
same
minute
fragments
have
passed
several
times
through
the
gizzards
of
worms
be
rejected
notwithstanding
its
inherent
probability
we
must
then
assume
that
in
all
the
above
cases
the
many
rounded
fragments
found
in
the
castings
had
all
accidentally
undergone
much
attrition
before
they
were
swallowed
and
this
is
highly
improbable
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
stated
that
fragments
of
ornamental
tiles
somewhat
harder
than
common
tiles
or
bricks
which
had
been
swallowed
only
once
by
worms
kept
in
confinement
were
with
the
doubtful
exception
of
one
or
two
of
the
smallest
grains
not
at
all
rounded
nevertheless
some
of
them
appeared
a
little
worn
though
not
rounded
notwithstanding
these
cases
if
we
consider
the
evidence
above
given
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
fragments
which
serve
as
millstones
in
the
gizzards
of
worms
suffer
when
of
a
not
very
hard
texture
some
amount
of
attrition
and
that
the
smaller
particles
in
the
earth
which
is
habitually
swallowed
in
such
astonishingly
large
quantities
by
worms
are
ground
together
and
are
thus
levigated
if
this
be
the
case
the
terra
tenuissima
pâte
excessivement
fine
which
the
castings
largely
consist
is
in
part
due
to
the
mechanical
action
of
the
gizzard
and
this
fine
matter
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
is
that
which
is
chiefly
washed
away
from
the
innumerable
castings
on
every
field
during
each
heavy
shower
of
rain
if
the
softer
stones
yield
at
all
the
harder
ones
will
suffer
some
slight
amount
of
wear
and
tear
the
trituration
of
small
particles
of
stone
in
the
gizzards
of
worms
is
of
more
importance
under
a
geological
point
of
view
than
may
at
first
appear
to
be
the
case
for
sorby
has
clearly
shown
that
the
ordinary
means
of
disintegration
namely
running
water
and
the
waves
of
the
sea
act
with
less
and
less
power
on
fragments
of
rock
the
smaller
they
are
hence
as
he
remarks
even
making
no
allowance
for
the
extra
buoying
up
of
very
minute
particles
by
a
current
of
water
depending
on
surface
cohesion
the
effects
of
wearing
on
the
form
of
the
grains
must
vary
directly
as
their
diameter
or
thereabouts
if
so
a
grain
of
an
inch
in
diameter
would
be
worn
ten
times
as
much
as
one
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
at
least
a
hundred
times
as
much
as
one
of
an
inch
in
diameter
perhaps
then
we
may
conclude
that
a
grain
of
an
inch
in
diameter
would
be
worn
as
much
or
more
in
drifting
a
mile
as
a
grain
of
an
inch
in
being
drifted
miles
on
the
same
principle
a
pebble
one
inch
in
diameter
would
be
worn
relatively
more
by
being
drifted
only
a
few
hundred
nor
should
we
forget
in
considering
the
power
which
worms
exert
in
triturating
particles
of
rock
that
there
is
good
evidence
that
on
each
acre
of
land
which
is
sufficiently
damp
and
not
too
sandy
gravelly
or
rocky
for
worms
to
inhabit
a
weight
of
more
than
ten
tons
of
earth
annually
passes
through
their
bodies
and
is
brought
to
the
surface
the
result
for
a
country
of
the
size
of
great
britain
within
a
period
not
very
long
in
a
geological
sense
such
as
a
million
years
can
not
be
insignificant
for
the
ten
tons
of
earth
has
to
be
multiplied
first
by
the
above
number
of
years
and
then
by
the
number
of
acres
fully
stocked
with
worms
and
in
england
together
with
scotland
the
land
which
is
cultivated
and
is
well
fitted
for
these
animals
has
been
estimated
at
above
million

we
are
now
prepared
to
consider
the
more
direct
part
which
worms
take
in
the
denudation
of
the
land
when
reflecting
on
denudation
it
formerly
appeared
to
me
as
it
has
to
others
that
a
nearly
level
or
very
gently
inclined
surface
covered
with
turf
could
suffer
no
loss
during
even
a
long
lapse
of
time
it
may
however
be
urged
that
at
long
intervals
debacles
of
rain
or
would
remove
all
the
mould
from
a
very
gentle
slope
but
when
examining
the
steep
slopes
in
glen
roy
i
was
struck
with
the
fact
how
rarely
any
such
event
could
have
happened
since
the
glacial
period
as
was
plain
from
the
state
of
the
three
successive
roads
or
but
the
difficulty
in
believing
that
earth
in
any
appreciable
quantity
can
be
removed
from
a
gently
inclined
surface
covered
with
vegetation
and
matted
with
roots
is
removed
through
the
agency
of
worms
for
the
many
castings
which
are
thrown
up
during
rain
and
those
thrown
up
some
little
time
before
heavy
rain
flow
for
a
short
distance
down
an
inclined
surface
moreover
much
of
the
finest
levigated
earth
is
washed
completely
away
from
the
castings
during
dry
weather
castings
often
disintegrate
into
small
rounded
pellets
and
these
from
their
weight
often
roll
down
any
slope
this
is
more
especially
apt
to
occur
when
they
are
started
by
the
wind
and
probably
when
started
by
the
touch
of
an
animal
however
small
we
shall
also
see
that
a
strong
wind
blows
all
the
castings
even
on
a
level
field
to
leeward
whilst
they
are
soft
and
in
like
manner
the
pellets
when
they
are
dry
if
the
wind
blows
in
nearly
the
direction
of
an
inclined
surface
the
flowing
down
of
the
castings
is
much
aided
the
observations
on
which
these
several
statements
are
founded
must
now
be
given
in
some
detail
castings
when
first
ejected
are
viscid
and
soft
during
rain
at
which
time
worms
apparently
prefer
to
eject
them
they
are
still
softer
so
that
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
worms
must
swallow
much
water
at
such
times
however
this
may
be
rain
even
when
not
very
heavy
if
long
continued
renders
castings
and
on
level
ground
they
then
spread
out
into
thin
circular
flat
discs
exactly
as
would
so
much
honey
or
very
soft
mortar
with
all
traces
of
their
vermiform
structure
lost
this
latter
fact
was
sometimes
made
evident
when
a
worm
had
subsequently
bored
through
a
flat
circular
disc
of
this
kind
and
heaped
up
a
fresh
vermiform
mass
in
the
centre
these
flat
subsided
discs
have
been
repeatedly
seen
by
me
after
heavy
rain
in
many
places
on
land
of
all
kinds
the
flowing
of
wet
the
rolling
of
dry
disintegrated
castings
down
inclined
castings
are
ejected
on
an
inclined
surface
during
or
shortly
before
heavy
rain
they
can
not
fail
to
flow
a
little
down
the
slope
thus
on
some
steep
slopes
in
knole
park
which
were
covered
with
coarse
grass
and
had
apparently
existed
in
this
state
from
time
immemorial
i
found
after
several
wet
days
that
almost
all
the
many
castings
were
considerably
elongated
in
the
line
of
the
slope
and
that
they
now
consisted
of
smooth
only
slightly
conical
masses
whenever
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
could
be
found
from
which
the
earth
had
been
ejected
there
was
more
earth
below
than
above
them
after
some
heavy
storms
of
rain
two
rather
steeply
inclined
fields
near
down
which
had
formerly
been
ploughed
and
were
now
rather
sparsely
clothed
with
poor
grass
were
visited
and
many
castings
extended
down
the
slopes
for
a
length
of
inches
which
was
twice
or
thrice
the
usual
diameter
of
the
castings
thrown
up
on
the
level
parts
of
these
same
fields
on
some
fine
grassy
slopes
in
holwood
park
inclined
at
angles
between
and
with
the
horizon
where
the
surface
apparently
had
never
been
disturbed
by
the
hand
of
man
castings
abounded
in
extraordinary
numbers
and
a
space
inches
in
length
transversely
to
the
slope
and
inches
in
the
line
of
the
slope
was
completely
coated
between
the
blades
of
grass
with
a
uniform
sheet
of
confluent
and
subsided
castings
here
also
in
many
places
the
castings
had
flowed
down
the
slope
and
now
formed
smooth
narrow
patches
of
earth
and
inches
in
length
some
of
these
consisted
of
two
castings
one
above
the
other
which
had
become
so
completely
confluent
that
they
could
hardly
be
distinguished
on
my
lawn
clothed
with
very
fine
grass
most
of
the
castings
are
black
but
some
are
yellowish
from
earth
having
been
brought
up
from
a
greater
depth
than
usual
and
the
of
these
yellow
castings
after
heavy
rain
could
be
clearly
seen
where
the
slope
was
and
where
it
was
less
than
some
evidence
of
their
flowing
down
could
still
be
detected
on
another
occasion
after
rain
which
was
never
heavy
but
which
lasted
for
hours
all
the
castings
on
this
same
gently
inclined
lawn
had
lost
their
vermiform
structure
and
they
had
flowed
so
that
fully
of
the
ejected
earth
lay
below
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
these
observations
led
me
to
make
others
with
more
care
eight
castings
were
found
on
my
lawn
where
the
are
fine
and
close
together
and
three
others
on
a
field
with
coarse
grass
the
inclination
of
the
surface
at
the
eleven
places
where
these
castings
were
collected
varied
between
and
the
mean
of
the
eleven
inclinations
being
the
length
of
the
castings
in
the
direction
of
the
slope
was
first
measured
with
as
much
accuracy
as
their
irregularities
would
permit
it
was
found
possible
to
make
these
measurements
within
about
of
an
inch
but
one
of
the
castings
was
too
irregular
to
admit
of
measurement
the
average
length
in
the
direction
of
the
slope
of
the
remaining
ten
castings
was
inches
the
castings
were
then
divided
with
a
knife
into
two
parts
along
a
horizontal
line
passing
through
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
which
was
discovered
by
slicing
off
the
turf
and
all
the
ejected
earth
was
separately
collected
namely
the
part
above
the
hole
and
the
part
below
afterwards
these
two
parts
were
weighed
in
every
case
there
was
much
more
earth
below
than
above
the
mean
weight
of
that
above
being
grains
and
of
that
below
grains
so
that
the
latter
was
very
nearly
double
the
former
as
on
level
ground
castings
are
commonly
thrown
up
almost
equally
round
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
this
difference
in
weight
indicates
the
amount
of
ejected
earth
which
had
flowed
down
the
slope
but
very
many
more
observations
would
be
requisite
to
arrive
at
any
general
result
for
the
nature
of
the
vegetation
and
other
accidental
circumstances
such
as
the
heaviness
of
the
rain
the
direction
and
force
of
the
wind
appear
to
be
more
important
in
determining
the
quantity
of
the
earth
which
flows
down
a
slope
than
its
angle
thus
with
four
castings
on
my
lawn
included
in
the
above
eleven
where
the
mean
slope
was
the
difference
in
the
amount
of
earth
above
and
below
the
burrows
was
greater
than
with
three
other
castings
on
the
same
lawn
where
the
mean
slope
was
we
may
however
take
the
above
eleven
cases
which
are
accurate
as
far
as
they
go
and
calculate
the
weight
of
the
ejected
earth
which
annually
flows
down
a
slope
having
a
mean
inclination
of
this
was
done
by
my
son
george
it
has
been
shown
that
almost
exactly
of
the
ejected
earth
is
found
below
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
and
above
it
now
if
the
which
is
below
the
hole
be
divided
into
two
equal
parts
the
upper
half
of
this
exactly
counterbalances
the
which
is
above
the
hole
so
that
as
far
as
regards
the
above
and
the
upper
half
of
the
below
there
is
no
flow
of
earth
down
the
the
earth
constituting
the
lower
half
of
the
is
however
displaced
through
distances
which
are
different
for
every
part
of
it
but
which
may
be
represented
by
the
distance
between
the
middle
point
of
the
lower
half
of
the
and
the
hole
so
that
the
average
distance
of
displacement
is
a
half
of
the
whole
length
of
the
now
the
average
length
of
ten
out
of
the
above
eleven
castings
was
inches
and
half
of
this
we
may
take
as
being
inch
it
may
therefore
be
concluded
that
of
the
whole
earth
brought
to
the
surface
was
in
these
cases
carried
down
the
slope
through
inch
it
was
shown
in
the
third
chapter
that
on
leith
hill
common
dry
earth
weighing
at
least
lbs
was
brought
up
by
worms
to
the
surface
on
a
square
yard
in
the
course
of
a
year
if
a
square
yard
be
drawn
on
a
hillside
with
two
of
its
sides
horizontal
then
it
is
clear
that
only
part
of
the
earth
brought
up
on
that
square
yard
would
be
near
enough
to
its
lower
side
to
cross
it
supposing
the
displacement
of
the
earth
to
be
through
one
inch
but
it
appears
that
only
of
the
earth
brought
up
can
be
considered
to
flow
downwards
hence
of
or
of
lbs
will
cross
the
lower
side
of
our
square
yard
in
a
year
now
of
lbs
is
oz
therefore
oz
of
dry
earth
will
annually
cross
each
linear
yard
running
horizontally
along
a
slope
having
the
above
inclination
or
very
nearly
lbs
will
annually
cross
a
horizontal
line
yards
in
length
on
a
having
this
inclination
a
more
accurate
though
still
very
rough
calculation
can
be
made
of
the
bulk
of
earth
which
in
its
natural
damp
state
annually
flows
down
the
same
slope
over
a
drawn
horizontally
across
it
from
the
several
cases
given
in
the
third
chapter
it
is
known
that
the
castings
annually
brought
to
the
surface
on
a
square
yard
if
uniformly
spread
out
would
form
a
layer
of
an
inch
in
thickness
it
therefore
follows
by
a
calculation
similar
to
the
one
already
given
that
of
or
cubic
inches
of
damp
earth
will
annually
cross
a
horizontal
line
one
yard
in
length
on
a
hillside
with
the
above
inclination
this
bulk
of
damp
castings
was
found
to
weigh
oz
therefore
lbs
of
damp
earth
instead
of
lbs
of
dry
earth
as
by
the
former
calculation
would
annually
cross
a
line
yards
in
length
on
our
inclined
surface
in
these
calculations
it
has
been
assumed
that
the
castings
flow
a
short
distance
downwards
during
the
whole
year
but
this
occurs
only
with
those
ejected
during
or
shortly
before
rain
so
that
the
above
results
are
thus
far
exaggerated
on
the
other
hand
during
rain
much
of
the
finest
earth
is
washed
to
a
considerable
distance
from
the
castings
even
where
the
slope
is
an
extremely
gentle
one
and
is
thus
wholly
lost
as
far
as
the
above
calculations
are
concerned
castings
ejected
during
dry
weather
and
which
have
set
hard
lose
in
the
same
manner
a
considerable
quantity
of
fine
earth
dried
castings
moreover
are
apt
to
disintegrate
into
little
pellets
which
often
roll
or
are
blown
down
any
inclined
surface
therefore
the
above
result
namely
that
cubic
inches
of
earth
weighing
oz
whilst
damp
annually
crosses
a
of
the
specified
kind
is
probably
not
much
if
at
all
exaggerated
this
amount
is
small
but
we
should
bear
in
mind
how
many
branching
valleys
intersect
most
countries
the
whole
length
of
which
must
be
very
great
and
that
earth
is
steadily
travelling
down
both
sides
of
each
valley
for
every
yards
in
length
in
a
valley
with
sides
sloping
as
in
the
foregoing
cases
cubic
inches
of
damp
earth
weighing
above
pounds
will
annually
reach
the
bottom
here
a
thick
bed
of
alluvium
will
accumulate
ready
to
be
washed
away
in
the
course
of
centuries
as
the
stream
in
the
middle
meanders
from
side
to
side
if
it
could
be
shown
that
worms
generally
excavate
their
burrows
at
right
angles
to
an
inclined
surface
and
this
would
be
their
shortest
course
for
bringing
up
earth
from
beneath
then
as
the
old
burrows
collapsed
from
the
weight
of
the
superincumbent
soil
the
collapsing
would
inevitably
cause
the
whole
bed
of
vegetable
mould
to
sink
or
slide
slowly
down
the
inclined
surface
but
to
ascertain
the
direction
of
many
burrows
was
found
too
difficult
and
troublesome
a
straight
piece
of
wire
was
however
pushed
into
burrows
on
several
sloping
fields
and
in
eight
cases
the
burrows
were
nearly
at
right
angles
to
the
slope
whilst
in
the
remaining
cases
they
were
indifferently
directed
at
various
angles
either
upwards
or
downwards
with
respect
to
the
slope
in
countries
where
the
rain
is
very
heavy
as
in
the
tropics
the
castings
appear
as
might
have
been
expected
to
be
washed
down
in
a
greater
degree
than
in
england
scott
informs
me
that
near
calcutta
the
tall
columnar
castings
previously
described
the
diameter
of
which
is
usually
between
and
inch
subside
on
a
level
surface
after
heavy
rain
into
almost
circular
thin
flat
discs
between
and
and
sometimes
inches
in
diameter
three
fresh
castings
which
had
been
ejected
in
the
botanic
gardens
on
a
slightly
inclined
artificial
bank
of
loamy
clay
were
carefully
measured
and
had
a
mean
height
of
and
a
mean
diameter
of
inches
these
after
heavy
rain
formed
elongated
patches
of
earth
with
a
mean
length
in
the
direction
of
the
slope
of
inches
as
the
earth
had
spread
very
little
up
the
slope
a
large
part
judging
from
the
original
diameter
of
these
castings
must
have
flowed
bodily
downwards
about
inches
moreover
some
of
the
finest
earth
of
which
they
were
composed
must
have
been
washed
completely
away
to
a
still
greater
distance
in
drier
sites
near
calcutta
a
species
of
worm
ejects
its
castings
not
in
vermiform
masses
but
in
little
pellets
of
varying
sizes
these
are
very
numerous
in
some
places
and
scott
says
that
they
are
washed
away
by
every
i
was
led
to
believe
that
a
considerable
quantity
of
fine
earth
is
washed
quite
away
from
castings
during
rain
from
the
surfaces
of
old
ones
being
often
studded
with
coarse
particles
accordingly
a
little
fine
precipitated
chalk
moistened
with
saliva
or
so
as
to
be
slightly
viscid
and
of
the
same
consistence
as
a
fresh
casting
was
placed
on
the
summits
of
several
castings
and
gently
mixed
with
them
these
castings
were
then
watered
through
a
very
fine
rose
the
drops
from
which
were
closer
together
than
those
of
rain
but
not
nearly
so
large
as
those
in
a
thunderstorm
nor
did
they
strike
the
ground
with
nearly
so
much
force
as
drops
during
heavy
rain
a
casting
thus
treated
subsided
with
surprising
slowness
owing
as
i
suppose
to
its
viscidity
it
did
not
flow
bodily
down
the
surface
of
the
lawn
which
was
here
inclined
at
an
angle
of
nevertheless
many
particles
of
the
chalk
were
found
three
inches
below
the
casting
the
experiment
was
repeated
on
three
other
castings
on
different
parts
of
the
lawn
which
sloped
at
and
and
particles
of
chalk
could
be
seen
between
and
inches
below
the
casting
and
after
the
surface
had
become
dry
particles
were
found
in
two
cases
at
a
distance
of
and
inches
several
other
castings
with
precipitated
chalk
placed
on
their
summits
were
left
to
the
natural
action
of
the
rain
in
one
case
after
rain
which
was
not
heavy
the
casting
was
longitudinally
streaked
with
white
in
two
other
cases
the
surface
of
the
ground
was
rendered
somewhat
white
for
a
distance
of
one
inch
from
the
casting
and
some
soil
collected
at
a
distance
of
inches
where
the
slope
was
effervesced
slightly
when
placed
in
acid
after
one
or
two
weeks
the
chalk
was
wholly
or
almost
wholly
washed
away
from
all
the
castings
on
which
it
had
been
placed
and
these
had
recovered
their
natural
colour
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
after
very
heavy
rain
shallow
pools
may
be
seen
on
level
or
nearly
level
fields
where
the
soil
is
not
very
porous
and
the
water
in
them
is
often
slightly
muddy
when
such
little
pools
have
dried
the
leaves
and
blades
of
grass
at
their
bottoms
are
generally
coated
with
a
thin
layer
of
mud
this
mud
i
believe
is
derived
in
large
part
from
recently
ejected
castings
king
informs
me
that
the
majority
of
the
before
described
gigantic
castings
which
he
found
on
a
fully
exposed
bare
gravelly
knoll
on
the
nilgiri
mountains
in
india
had
been
more
or
less
weathered
by
the
previous
monsoon
and
most
of
them
presented
a
subsided
appearance
the
worms
here
eject
their
castings
only
during
the
rainy
season
and
at
the
time
of
king
s
visit
no
rain
had
fallen
for
days
he
carefully
examined
the
ground
between
the
place
where
these
huge
castings
lay
and
a
little
watercourse
at
the
base
of
the
knoll
and
nowhere
was
there
any
accumulation
of
fine
earth
such
as
would
necessarily
have
been
left
by
the
disintegration
of
the
castings
if
they
had
not
been
wholly
removed
he
therefore
has
no
hesitation
in
asserting
that
the
whole
of
these
huge
castings
are
annually
washed
during
the
two
monsoons
when
about
inches
of
rain
fall
into
the
little
and
thence
into
the
plains
lying
below
at
a
depth
of
or
feet
castings
ejected
before
or
during
dry
weather
become
hard
sometimes
surprisingly
hard
from
the
particles
of
earth
having
been
cemented
together
by
the
intestinal
secretions
frost
seems
to
be
less
effective
in
their
disintegration
than
might
have
been
expected
nevertheless
they
readily
disintegrate
into
small
pellets
after
being
alternately
moistened
with
rain
and
again
dried
those
which
have
flowed
during
rain
down
a
slope
disintegrate
in
the
same
manner
such
pellets
often
roll
a
little
down
any
sloping
surface
their
descent
being
sometimes
much
aided
by
the
wind
the
whole
bottom
of
a
broad
dry
ditch
in
my
grounds
where
there
were
very
few
fresh
castings
was
completely
covered
with
these
pellets
or
disintegrated
castings
which
had
rolled
down
the
steep
sides
inclined
at
an
angle
of
near
nice
in
places
where
the
great
cylindrical
castings
previously
described
abound
the
soil
consists
of
very
fine
loam
and
king
informs
me
that
these
castings
are
extremely
liable
to
crumble
during
dry
weather
into
small
fragments
which
are
soon
acted
on
by
rain
and
then
sink
down
so
as
to
be
no
longer
distinguishable
from
the
surrounding
soil
he
sent
me
a
mass
of
such
disintegrated
castings
collected
on
the
top
of
a
bank
where
none
could
have
rolled
down
from
above
they
must
have
been
ejected
within
the
previous
five
or
six
months
but
they
now
consisted
of
more
or
less
rounded
fragments
of
all
sizes
from
of
an
inch
in
diameter
to
minute
grains
and
mere
dust
king
witnessed
the
crumbling
process
whilst
drying
some
perfect
castings
which
he
afterwards
sent
me
scott
also
remarks
on
the
crumbling
of
the
castings
near
calcutta
and
on
the
mountains
of
sikkim
during
the
hot
and
dry
season
when
the
castings
near
nice
had
been
ejected
on
an
inclined
surface
the
disintegrated
fragments
rolled
downwards
without
losing
their
distinctive
shape
and
in
some
places
could
be
collected
in
king
observed
a
striking
instance
of
this
fact
on
the
corniche
road
where
a
drain
about
feet
wide
and
inches
deep
had
been
made
to
catch
the
surface
drainage
from
the
adjoining
the
bottom
of
this
drain
was
covered
for
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
to
a
depth
of
from
to
inches
by
a
layer
of
broken
castings
still
retaining
their
characteristic
shape
nearly
all
these
innumerable
fragments
had
rolled
down
from
above
for
extremely
few
castings
had
been
ejected
in
the
drain
itself
the
was
steep
but
varied
much
in
inclination
which
king
estimated
at
from
to
with
the
horizon
he
climbed
up
the
slope
and
found
every
here
and
there
little
embankments
formed
by
fragments
of
the
castings
that
had
been
arrested
in
their
downward
progress
by
irregularities
of
the
surface
by
stones
twigs
one
little
group
of
plants
of
had
acted
in
this
manner
and
quite
a
small
bank
of
soil
had
collected
round
it
much
of
this
soil
had
crumbled
down
but
a
great
deal
of
it
still
retained
the
form
of
king
dug
up
this
plant
and
was
struck
with
the
thickness
of
the
soil
which
must
have
recently
accumulated
over
the
crown
of
the
rhizoma
as
shown
by
the
length
of
the
bleached
petioles
in
comparison
with
those
of
other
plants
of
the
same
kind
where
there
had
been
no
such
accumulation
the
earth
thus
accumulated
had
no
doubt
been
secured
as
i
have
everywhere
seen
by
the
smaller
roots
of
the
plants
after
describing
this
and
other
analogous
cases
king
concludes
i
can
have
no
doubt
that
worms
help
greatly
in
the
process
of
of
earth
on
steep
horizontal
ledges
one
above
another
have
been
observed
on
steep
grassy
slopes
in
many
parts
of
the
world
the
formation
has
been
attributed
to
animals
travelling
repeatedly
along
the
slope
in
the
same
horizontal
lines
while
grazing
and
that
they
do
thus
move
and
use
the
ledges
is
certain
but
professor
henslow
a
most
careful
observer
told
sir
hooker
that
he
was
convinced
that
this
was
not
the
sole
cause
of
their
formation
sir
hooker
saw
such
ledges
on
the
himalayan
and
atlas
ranges
where
there
were
no
domesticated
animals
and
not
many
wild
ones
but
these
latter
would
it
is
probable
use
the
ledges
at
night
while
grazing
like
our
domesticated
animals
a
friend
observed
for
me
the
ledges
on
the
alps
of
switzerland
and
states
that
they
ran
at
or
one
above
the
other
and
were
about
a
foot
in
breadth
they
had
been
deeply
pitted
by
the
feet
of
grazing
cows
similar
ledges
were
observed
by
the
same
friend
on
our
chalk
downs
and
on
an
old
talus
of
thrown
out
of
a
quarry
which
had
become
clothed
with
turf
my
son
francis
examined
a
chalk
escarpment
near
lewes
and
here
on
a
part
which
was
very
steep
sloping
at
with
the
horizon
about
flat
ledges
extended
horizontally
for
more
than
yards
at
an
average
distance
of
about
inches
one
beneath
the
other
they
were
from
to
inches
in
breadth
when
viewed
from
a
distance
they
presented
a
striking
appearance
owing
to
their
parallelism
but
when
examined
closely
they
were
seen
to
be
somewhat
sinuous
and
one
often
ran
into
another
giving
the
appearance
of
the
ledge
having
forked
into
two
they
are
formed
of
earth
which
on
the
outside
where
thickest
was
in
one
case
inches
and
in
another
case
between
and
inches
in
thickness
above
the
ledges
the
thickness
of
the
earth
over
the
chalk
was
in
the
former
case
and
in
the
latter
only
inches
the
grass
grew
more
vigorously
on
the
outer
edges
of
the
ledges
than
on
any
other
part
of
the
slope
and
here
formed
a
tufted
fringe
their
middle
part
was
bare
but
whether
this
had
been
caused
by
the
trampling
of
sheep
which
sometimes
frequent
the
ledges
my
son
could
not
ascertain
nor
could
he
feel
sure
how
much
of
the
earth
on
the
middle
and
bare
parts
consisted
of
disintegrated
which
had
rolled
down
from
above
but
he
felt
convinced
that
some
had
thus
originated
and
it
was
manifest
that
the
ledges
with
their
edges
would
arrest
any
small
object
rolling
down
from
above
at
one
end
or
side
of
the
bank
bearing
these
ledges
the
surface
consisted
in
parts
of
bare
chalk
and
here
the
ledges
were
very
irregular
at
the
other
end
of
the
bank
the
slope
suddenly
became
less
steep
and
here
the
ledges
ceased
rather
abruptly
but
little
embankments
only
a
foot
or
two
in
length
were
still
present
the
slope
became
steeper
lower
down
the
hill
and
the
regular
ledges
then
reappeared
another
of
my
sons
observed
on
the
inland
side
of
beachy
head
where
the
surface
sloped
at
about
many
short
little
embankments
like
those
just
mentioned
they
extended
horizontally
and
were
from
a
few
inches
to
two
or
three
feet
in
length
they
supported
tufts
of
grass
growing
vigorously
the
average
thickness
of
the
mould
of
which
they
were
formed
taken
from
nine
measurements
was
inches
while
that
of
the
mould
above
and
beneath
them
was
on
an
average
only
inches
and
on
each
side
on
the
same
level
inches
on
the
upper
parts
of
the
slope
these
embankments
showed
no
signs
of
having
been
trampled
on
by
sheep
but
in
the
lower
parts
such
signs
were
fairly
plain
no
long
continuous
ledges
had
here
been
formed
if
the
little
embankments
above
the
corniche
road
which
king
saw
in
the
act
of
formation
by
the
accumulation
of
disintegrated
and
rolled
were
to
become
confluent
along
horizontal
lines
ledges
would
be
formed
each
embankment
would
tend
to
extend
laterally
by
the
lateral
extension
of
the
arrested
castings
and
animals
grazing
on
a
steep
slope
would
almost
certainly
make
use
of
every
prominence
at
nearly
the
same
level
and
would
indent
the
turf
between
them
and
such
intermediate
indentations
would
again
arrest
the
castings
an
irregular
ledge
when
once
formed
would
also
tend
to
become
more
regular
and
horizontal
by
some
of
the
castings
rolling
laterally
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
parts
which
would
thus
be
raised
any
projection
beneath
a
ledge
would
not
afterwards
receive
disintegrated
matter
from
above
and
would
tend
to
be
obliterated
by
rain
and
other
atmospheric
agencies
there
is
some
analogy
between
the
formation
as
here
supposed
of
these
ledges
and
that
of
the
ripples
of
sand
as
described
by
lyell
the
steep
sides
of
a
mountainous
valley
in
westmoreland
called
grisedale
was
marked
in
many
places
with
innumerable
lines
of
miniature
cliffs
with
almost
horizontal
little
ledges
at
their
bases
their
formation
was
in
no
way
connected
with
the
action
of
worms
for
castings
could
not
anywhere
be
seen
and
their
absence
is
an
inexplicable
fact
although
the
turf
lay
in
many
places
over
a
considerable
thickness
of
and
moraine
rubbish
nor
as
far
as
i
could
judge
was
the
formation
of
these
little
cliffs
at
all
closely
connected
with
the
trampling
of
cows
or
sheep
it
appeared
as
if
the
whole
superficial
somewhat
argillaceous
earth
while
partially
held
together
by
the
roots
of
the
grasses
had
slided
a
little
way
down
the
mountain
sides
and
in
thus
sliding
had
yielded
and
cracked
in
horizontal
lines
transversely
to
the
slope
blown
to
leeward
by
the
have
seen
that
moist
castings
flow
and
that
disintegrated
castings
roll
down
any
inclined
surface
and
we
shall
now
see
that
castings
recently
ejected
on
level
surfaces
are
blown
during
gales
of
wind
accompanied
by
rain
to
leeward
this
has
been
observed
by
me
many
times
on
many
fields
during
several
successive
years
after
such
gales
the
castings
present
a
gently
inclined
and
smooth
or
sometimes
furrowed
surface
to
windward
while
they
are
steeply
inclined
or
precipitous
to
leeward
so
that
they
resemble
on
a
miniature
scale
hillocks
of
rock
they
are
often
cavernous
on
the
leeward
side
from
the
upper
part
having
curled
over
the
lower
part
during
one
unusually
heavy
gale
with
torrents
of
rain
many
castings
were
wholly
blown
to
leeward
so
that
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
were
left
naked
and
exposed
on
the
windward
side
recent
castings
naturally
flow
down
an
inclined
surface
but
on
a
grassy
field
which
sloped
between
and
several
were
found
after
a
heavy
gale
blown
up
the
slope
this
likewise
occurred
on
another
occasion
on
a
part
of
my
lawn
where
the
slope
was
somewhat
less
on
a
third
occasion
the
castings
on
the
steep
sides
of
a
valley
down
which
a
gale
had
blown
were
directed
obliquely
instead
of
straight
down
the
slope
and
this
was
obviously
due
to
the
combined
action
of
the
wind
and
gravity
four
castings
on
my
lawn
where
the
downward
inclination
was
and
mean
towards
the
after
a
heavy
gale
with
rain
were
divided
across
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
and
weighed
in
the
manner
formerly
described
the
mean
weight
of
the
earth
below
the
mouths
of
burrows
and
to
leeward
was
to
that
above
the
mouths
and
on
the
windward
side
as
to
whereas
we
have
seen
that
with
several
castings
which
had
flowed
down
slopes
having
a
mean
inclination
of
and
with
three
castings
where
the
inclination
was
above
the
proportional
weight
of
the
earth
below
to
that
above
the
burrows
was
as
only
to
these
several
cases
show
how
efficiently
gales
of
wind
accompanied
by
rain
act
in
displacing
recently
ejected
castings
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
even
a
moderately
strong
wind
will
produce
some
slight
effect
on
them
dry
and
indurated
castings
after
their
disintegration
into
small
fragments
or
pellets
are
sometimes
probably
often
blown
by
a
strong
wind
to
leeward
this
was
observed
on
four
occasions
but
i
did
not
sufficiently
attend
to
this
point
one
old
casting
on
a
gently
sloping
bank
was
blown
quite
away
by
a
strong
wind
king
believes
that
the
wind
removes
the
greater
part
of
the
old
crumbling
castings
near
nice
several
old
castings
on
my
lawn
were
marked
with
pins
and
protected
from
any
disturbance
they
were
examined
after
an
interval
of
weeks
during
which
time
the
weather
had
been
alternately
dry
and
rainy
some
which
were
of
a
yellowish
colour
had
been
washed
almost
completely
away
as
could
be
seen
by
the
colour
of
the
surrounding
ground
others
had
completely
disappeared
and
these
no
doubt
had
been
blown
away
lastly
others
still
remained
and
would
long
remain
as
blades
of
grass
had
grown
through
them
on
poor
which
has
never
been
rolled
and
has
not
been
much
trampled
on
by
animals
the
whole
surface
is
sometimes
dotted
with
little
pimples
through
and
on
which
grass
grows
and
these
pimples
consist
of
old
in
all
the
many
observed
cases
of
soft
castings
blown
to
leeward
this
had
been
effected
by
strong
winds
accompanied
by
rain
as
such
winds
in
england
generally
blow
from
the
south
and
earth
must
on
the
whole
tend
to
travel
over
our
fields
in
a
north
and
direction
this
fact
is
interesting
because
it
might
be
thought
that
none
could
be
removed
from
a
level
surface
by
any
means
in
thick
and
level
woods
protected
from
the
wind
castings
will
never
be
removed
as
long
as
the
wood
lasts
and
mould
will
here
tend
to
accumulate
to
the
depth
at
which
worms
can
work
i
tried
to
procure
evidence
as
to
how
much
mould
is
blown
whilst
in
the
state
of
castings
by
our
wet
southern
gales
to
the
over
open
and
flat
land
by
looking
to
the
level
of
the
surface
on
opposite
sides
of
old
trees
and
but
i
failed
owing
to
the
unequal
growth
of
the
roots
of
trees
and
to
most
having
been
formerly
ploughed
on
an
open
plain
near
stonehenge
there
exist
shallow
circular
trenches
with
a
low
embankment
outside
surrounding
level
spaces
yards
in
diameter
these
rings
appear
very
ancient
and
are
believed
to
be
contemporaneous
with
the
druidical
stones
castings
ejected
within
these
circular
spaces
if
blown
to
the
by
winds
would
form
a
layer
of
mould
within
the
trench
thicker
on
the
than
on
any
other
side
but
the
site
was
not
favourable
for
the
action
of
worms
for
the
mould
over
the
surrounding
chalk
formation
with
flints
was
only
inches
in
thickness
from
a
mean
of
six
observations
made
at
a
distance
of
yards
outside
the
embankment
the
thickness
of
the
mould
within
two
of
the
circular
trenches
was
measured
every
yards
all
round
on
the
inner
sides
near
the
bottom
my
son
horace
protracted
these
measurements
on
paper
and
though
the
curved
line
representing
the
thickness
of
the
mould
was
extremely
irregular
yet
in
both
diagrams
it
could
be
seen
to
be
thicker
on
the
side
than
elsewhere
when
a
mean
of
all
the
measurements
in
both
the
trenches
was
laid
down
and
the
line
smoothed
it
was
obvious
that
the
mould
was
thickest
in
the
quarter
of
the
circle
between
and
and
thinnest
in
the
quarter
between
and
especially
at
this
latter
point
besides
the
foregoing
measurements
six
others
were
taken
near
together
in
one
of
the
circular
trenches
on
the
side
and
the
mould
here
had
a
mean
thickness
of
inches
while
the
mean
of
six
other
measurements
on
the
side
was
only
inches
these
observations
indicate
that
the
castings
had
been
blown
by
the
winds
from
the
circular
enclosed
space
into
the
trench
on
the
side
but
many
more
measurements
in
other
analogous
cases
would
be
requisite
for
a
trustworthy
result
the
amount
of
fine
earth
brought
to
the
surface
under
the
form
of
castings
and
afterwards
transported
by
the
winds
accompanied
by
rain
or
that
which
flows
and
rolls
down
an
inclined
surface
no
doubt
is
small
in
the
course
of
a
few
scores
of
years
for
otherwise
all
the
inequalities
in
our
pasture
fields
would
be
smoothed
within
a
much
shorter
period
than
appears
to
be
the
case
but
the
amount
which
is
thus
transported
in
the
course
of
thousands
of
years
can
not
fail
to
be
considerable
and
deserves
attention
de
beaumont
looks
at
the
vegetable
mould
which
everywhere
covers
the
land
as
a
fixed
line
from
which
the
amount
of
denudation
may
be
measured
he
ignores
the
continued
formation
of
fresh
mould
by
the
disintegration
of
the
underlying
rocks
and
fragments
of
rock
and
it
is
curious
to
find
how
much
more
philosophical
were
the
views
maintained
long
ago
by
playfair
who
in
wrote
in
the
permanence
of
a
coat
of
vegetable
mould
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
we
have
a
demonstrative
proof
of
the
continued
destruction
of
the
encampments
and
de
beaumont
adduces
the
present
state
of
many
ancient
encampments
and
tumuli
and
of
old
ploughed
fields
as
evidence
that
the
surface
of
the
land
undergoes
hardly
any
degradation
but
it
does
not
appear
that
he
ever
examined
the
thickness
of
the
mould
over
different
parts
of
such
old
remains
he
relies
chiefly
on
indirect
but
apparently
trustworthy
evidence
that
the
slopes
of
the
old
embankments
are
the
same
as
they
originally
were
and
it
is
obvious
that
he
could
know
nothing
about
their
original
heights
in
knole
park
a
mound
had
been
thrown
up
behind
the
which
appeared
to
have
been
formed
of
earth
originally
supported
by
square
blocks
of
turf
the
sides
sloped
as
nearly
as
i
could
estimate
them
at
an
angle
of
or
with
the
horizon
and
they
were
covered
especially
on
the
northern
side
with
long
coarse
grass
beneath
which
many
were
found
these
had
flowed
bodily
downwards
and
others
had
rolled
down
as
pellets
hence
it
is
certain
that
as
long
as
a
mound
of
this
kind
is
tenanted
by
worms
its
height
will
be
continually
lowered
the
fine
earth
which
flows
or
rolls
down
the
sides
of
such
a
mound
accumulates
at
its
base
in
the
form
of
a
talus
a
bed
even
a
very
thin
bed
of
fine
earth
is
eminently
favourable
for
worms
so
that
a
greater
number
of
castings
would
tend
to
be
ejected
on
a
talus
thus
formed
than
elsewhere
and
these
would
be
partially
washed
away
by
every
heavy
shower
and
be
spread
over
the
adjoining
level
ground
the
final
result
would
be
the
lowering
of
the
whole
mound
whilst
the
inclination
of
the
sides
would
not
be
greatly
lessened
the
same
result
would
assuredly
follow
with
ancient
embankments
and
tumuli
except
where
they
had
been
formed
of
gravel
or
of
nearly
pure
sand
as
such
matter
is
unfavourable
for
worms
many
old
fortifications
and
tumuli
are
believed
to
be
at
least
years
old
and
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
in
many
places
about
one
inch
of
mould
is
brought
to
the
surface
in
years
or
two
inches
in
years
therefore
in
so
long
a
period
as
years
a
large
amount
of
earth
will
have
been
repeatedly
brought
to
the
surface
on
most
old
embankments
and
tumuli
especially
on
the
talus
round
their
bases
and
much
of
this
earth
will
have
been
washed
completely
away
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
all
ancient
mounds
when
not
formed
of
materials
unfavourable
to
worms
will
have
been
somewhat
lowered
in
the
course
of
centuries
although
their
inclinations
may
not
have
been
greatly
changed
formerly
a
very
remote
period
and
in
many
countries
land
has
been
ploughed
so
that
convex
beds
called
crowns
or
ridges
usually
about
feet
across
and
separated
by
furrows
have
been
thrown
up
the
furrows
are
directed
so
as
to
carry
off
the
surface
water
in
my
attempts
to
ascertain
how
long
a
time
these
crowns
and
furrows
last
when
ploughed
land
has
been
converted
into
pasture
obstacles
of
many
kinds
were
encountered
it
is
rarely
known
when
a
field
was
last
ploughed
and
some
fields
which
were
thought
to
have
been
in
pasture
from
time
immemorial
were
afterwards
discovered
to
have
been
ploughed
only
or
years
before
during
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
when
the
price
of
corn
was
very
high
land
of
all
kinds
seems
to
have
been
ploughed
in
britain
there
is
however
no
reason
to
doubt
that
in
many
cases
the
old
crowns
and
furrows
have
been
preserved
from
a
very
ancient
period
that
they
should
have
been
preserved
for
very
unequal
lengths
of
time
would
naturally
follow
from
the
crowns
when
first
thrown
up
having
differed
much
in
height
in
different
districts
as
is
now
the
case
with
recently
ploughed
land
in
old
pasture
fields
the
mould
wherever
measurements
were
made
was
found
to
be
from
to
inches
thicker
in
the
furrows
than
on
the
crowns
but
this
would
naturally
follow
from
the
finer
earth
having
been
washed
from
the
crowns
into
the
furrows
before
the
land
was
well
clothed
with
turf
and
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
part
worms
may
have
played
in
the
work
nevertheless
from
what
we
have
seen
castings
would
certainly
tend
to
flow
and
to
be
washed
during
heavy
rain
from
the
crowns
into
the
furrows
but
as
soon
as
a
bed
of
fine
earth
had
by
any
means
been
accumulated
in
the
furrows
it
would
be
more
favourable
for
worms
than
the
other
parts
and
a
greater
number
of
castings
would
be
thrown
up
here
than
elsewhere
and
as
the
furrows
on
sloping
land
are
usually
directed
so
as
to
carry
off
the
surface
water
some
of
the
finest
earth
would
be
washed
from
the
castings
which
had
been
here
ejected
and
be
carried
completely
away
the
result
would
be
that
the
furrows
would
be
filled
up
very
slowly
while
the
crowns
would
be
lowered
perhaps
still
more
slowly
by
the
flowing
and
rolling
of
the
castings
down
their
gentle
inclinations
into
the
furrows
nevertheless
it
might
be
expected
that
old
furrows
especially
those
on
a
sloping
surface
would
in
the
course
of
time
be
filled
up
and
disappear
some
careful
observers
however
who
examined
fields
for
me
in
gloucestershire
and
staffordshire
could
not
detect
any
difference
in
the
state
of
the
furrows
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
of
sloping
fields
supposed
to
have
been
long
in
pasture
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
crowns
and
furrows
would
last
for
an
almost
endless
number
of
centuries
on
the
other
hand
the
process
of
obliteration
seems
to
have
commenced
in
some
places
thus
in
a
grass
field
in
north
wales
known
to
have
been
ploughed
about
years
ago
which
sloped
at
an
angle
of
to
the
the
depth
of
the
furrows
only
feet
apart
was
carefully
measured
and
was
found
to
be
about
inches
in
the
upper
part
of
the
slope
and
only
inch
near
the
base
where
they
could
be
traced
with
difficulty
on
another
field
sloping
at
about
the
same
angle
to
the
the
furrows
were
scarcely
perceptible
in
the
lower
part
although
these
same
furrows
when
followed
on
to
some
adjoining
level
ground
were
from
to
inches
in
depth
a
third
and
closely
similar
case
was
observed
in
a
fourth
case
the
mould
in
a
furrow
in
the
upper
part
of
a
sloping
field
was
inches
and
in
the
lower
part
inches
in
thickness
on
the
chalk
downs
at
about
a
mile
distance
from
stonehenge
my
son
william
examined
a
furrowed
surface
sloping
at
from
to
which
an
old
shepherd
said
had
not
been
ploughed
within
the
memory
of
man
the
depth
of
one
furrow
was
measured
at
points
in
a
length
of
paces
and
was
found
to
be
deeper
where
the
slope
was
greatest
and
where
less
earth
would
naturally
tend
to
accumulate
and
at
the
base
it
almost
disappeared
the
thickness
of
the
mould
in
this
furrow
in
the
upper
part
was
inches
which
increased
to
inches
a
little
above
the
steepest
part
of
the
slope
and
at
the
base
in
the
middle
of
the
narrow
valley
at
a
point
which
the
furrow
if
continued
would
have
struck
it
amounted
to
inches
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
there
were
very
faint
almost
obliterated
traces
of
furrows
another
analogous
but
not
so
decided
a
case
was
observed
at
a
few
miles
distance
from
stonehenge
on
the
whole
it
appears
that
the
crowns
and
furrows
on
land
formerly
ploughed
but
now
covered
with
grass
tend
slowly
to
disappear
when
the
surface
is
inclined
and
this
is
probably
in
large
part
due
to
the
action
of
worms
but
that
the
crowns
and
furrows
last
for
a
very
long
time
when
the
surface
is
nearly
level
and
amount
of
mould
over
the
chalk
are
often
ejected
in
extraordinary
numbers
on
steep
slopes
where
the
chalk
comes
close
to
the
surface
as
my
son
william
observed
near
winchester
and
elsewhere
if
such
castings
are
largely
washed
away
during
heavy
rains
it
is
difficult
to
understand
at
first
how
any
mould
can
still
remain
on
our
downs
as
there
does
not
appear
any
evident
means
for
supplying
the
loss
there
is
moreover
another
cause
of
loss
namely
in
the
percolation
of
the
finer
particles
of
earth
into
the
fissures
in
the
chalk
and
into
the
chalk
itself
these
considerations
led
me
to
doubt
for
a
time
whether
i
had
not
exaggerated
the
amount
of
fine
earth
which
flows
or
rolls
down
slopes
under
the
form
of
castings
and
i
sought
for
additional
information
in
some
places
the
castings
on
chalk
downs
consist
largely
of
calcareous
matter
and
here
the
supply
is
of
course
unlimited
but
in
other
places
for
instance
on
a
part
of
teg
down
near
winchester
the
castings
were
all
black
and
did
not
effervesce
with
acids
the
mould
over
the
chalk
was
here
only
from
to
inches
in
thickness
so
again
on
the
plain
near
stonehenge
the
mould
apparently
free
from
calcareous
matter
averaged
rather
less
than
inches
in
thickness
why
worms
should
penetrate
and
bring
up
chalk
in
some
places
and
not
in
others
i
do
not
know
in
many
districts
where
the
land
is
nearly
level
a
bed
several
feet
in
thickness
of
red
clay
full
of
unworn
flints
overlies
the
upper
chalk
this
overlying
matter
the
surface
of
which
has
been
converted
into
mould
consists
of
the
undissolved
residue
from
the
chalk
it
may
be
well
here
to
recall
the
case
of
the
fragments
of
chalk
buried
beneath
on
one
of
my
fields
the
angles
of
which
were
so
completely
rounded
in
the
course
of
years
that
the
fragments
now
resembled
pebbles
this
must
have
been
effected
by
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
rain
and
in
the
ground
by
the
and
by
the
corroding
power
of
living
roots
why
a
thick
mass
of
residue
has
not
been
left
on
the
chalk
wherever
the
land
is
nearly
level
may
perhaps
be
accounted
for
by
the
percolation
of
the
fine
particles
into
the
fissures
which
are
often
present
in
the
chalk
and
are
either
open
or
are
filled
up
with
impure
chalk
or
into
the
solid
chalk
itself
that
such
percolation
occurs
can
hardly
be
doubted
my
son
collected
some
powdered
and
fragmentary
chalk
beneath
the
turf
near
winchester
the
former
was
found
by
colonel
parsons
to
contain
per
and
the
fragments
per
cent
of
earthy
matter
on
the
flanks
of
the
escarpment
near
abinger
in
surrey
some
chalk
close
beneath
a
layer
of
flints
inches
in
thickness
and
covered
by
inches
of
mould
yielded
a
residue
of
per
cent
of
earthy
matter
on
the
other
hand
the
upper
chalk
properly
contains
as
i
was
informed
by
the
late
david
forbes
who
had
made
many
analyses
only
from
to
per
cent
of
earthy
matter
and
two
samples
from
pits
near
my
house
contained
and
per
cent
i
mention
these
latter
cases
because
from
the
thickness
of
the
overlying
bed
of
red
clay
with
flints
i
had
imagined
that
the
underlying
chalk
might
here
be
less
pure
than
elsewhere
the
cause
of
the
residue
accumulating
more
in
some
places
than
in
others
may
be
attributed
to
a
layer
of
argillaceous
matter
having
been
left
at
an
early
period
on
the
chalk
and
this
would
check
the
subsequent
percolation
of
earthy
matter
into
it
from
the
facts
now
given
we
may
conclude
that
castings
ejected
on
our
chalk
downs
suffer
some
loss
by
the
percolation
of
their
finer
matter
into
the
chalk
but
such
impure
superficial
chalk
when
dissolved
would
leave
a
larger
supply
of
earthy
matter
to
be
added
to
the
mould
than
in
the
case
of
pure
chalk
besides
the
loss
caused
by
percolation
some
fine
earth
is
certainly
washed
down
the
sloping
surfaces
of
our
downs
the
process
however
will
be
checked
in
the
course
of
time
for
although
i
do
not
know
how
thin
a
layer
of
mould
suffices
to
support
worms
yet
a
limit
must
at
last
be
reached
and
then
their
castings
would
cease
to
be
ejected
or
would
become
scanty
the
following
cases
show
that
a
considerable
quantity
of
fine
earth
is
washed
down
the
thickness
of
the
mould
was
measured
at
points
yards
apart
across
a
small
valley
in
the
chalk
near
winchester
the
sides
sloped
gently
at
first
then
became
inclined
at
about
then
more
gently
to
near
the
bottom
which
transversely
was
almost
level
and
about
yards
across
in
the
bottom
the
mean
thickness
of
the
mould
from
five
measurements
was
inches
whilst
on
the
sides
of
the
valley
where
the
inclination
varied
between
and
its
mean
thickness
was
rather
less
than
inches
as
the
bottom
of
the
valley
sloped
at
an
angle
of
only
between
and
it
is
probable
that
most
of
the
layer
of
mould
had
been
washed
down
from
the
flanks
of
the
valley
and
not
from
the
upper
part
but
as
a
shepherd
said
that
he
had
seen
water
flowing
in
this
valley
after
the
sudden
thawing
of
snow
it
is
possible
that
some
earth
may
have
been
brought
down
from
the
upper
part
or
on
the
other
hand
that
some
may
have
been
carried
further
down
the
valley
closely
similar
results
with
respect
to
the
thickness
of
the
mould
were
obtained
in
a
neighbouring
valley
catherine
s
hill
near
winchester
is
feet
in
height
and
consists
of
a
steep
cone
of
chalk
about
of
a
mile
in
diameter
the
upper
part
was
converted
by
the
romans
or
as
some
think
by
the
ancient
britons
into
an
encampment
by
the
excavation
of
a
deep
and
broad
ditch
all
round
it
most
of
the
chalk
removed
during
the
work
was
thrown
upwards
by
which
a
projecting
bank
was
formed
and
this
effectually
prevents
which
are
numerous
in
parts
stones
and
other
objects
from
being
washed
or
rolled
into
the
ditch
the
mould
on
the
upper
and
fortified
part
of
the
hill
was
found
to
be
in
most
places
only
from
to
inches
in
thickness
whereas
it
had
accumulated
at
the
foot
of
the
embankment
above
the
ditch
to
a
thickness
in
most
places
of
from
to
inches
on
the
embankment
itself
the
mould
was
only
to
inch
in
thickness
and
within
the
ditch
at
the
bottom
it
varied
from
to
but
was
in
one
spot
inches
in
thickness
on
the
side
of
the
hill
either
no
embankment
had
ever
been
thrown
up
above
the
ditch
or
it
had
subsequently
been
removed
so
that
here
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
earth
and
stones
being
washed
into
the
ditch
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
mould
formed
a
layer
from
to
inches
in
thickness
it
should
however
be
stated
that
here
and
on
other
parts
of
the
slope
the
bed
of
mould
often
contained
fragments
of
chalk
and
flint
which
had
obviously
rolled
down
at
different
times
from
above
the
interstices
in
the
underlying
fragmentary
chalk
were
also
filled
up
with
mould
my
son
examined
the
surface
of
this
hill
to
its
base
in
a
direction
beneath
the
great
ditch
where
the
slope
was
about
the
mould
was
very
thin
namely
from
to
inches
whilst
near
the
base
where
the
slope
was
only
to
it
increased
to
between
and
inches
in
thickness
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
on
this
artificially
modified
hill
as
well
as
in
the
natural
valleys
of
the
neighbouring
chalk
downs
some
fine
earth
probably
derived
in
large
part
from
is
washed
down
and
accumulates
in
the
lower
parts
notwithstanding
the
percolation
of
an
unknown
quantity
into
the
underlying
chalk
a
supply
of
fresh
earthy
matter
being
afforded
by
the
dissolution
of
the
chalk
through
atmospheric
and
other
agencies

conclusion
summary
of
the
part
which
worms
have
played
in
the
history
of
the
aid
in
the
disintegration
of
the
denudation
of
the
the
preservation
of
ancient
the
preparation
of
the
soil
for
the
growth
of
powers
of
worms
have
played
a
more
important
part
in
the
history
of
the
world
than
most
persons
would
at
first
suppose
in
almost
all
humid
countries
they
are
extraordinarily
numerous
and
for
their
size
possess
great
muscular
power
in
many
parts
of
england
a
weight
of
more
than
ten
tons
kilogrammes
of
dry
earth
annually
passes
through
their
bodies
and
is
brought
to
the
surface
on
each
acre
of
land
so
that
the
whole
superficial
bed
of
vegetable
mould
passes
through
their
bodies
in
the
course
of
every
few
years
from
the
collapsing
of
the
old
burrows
the
mould
is
in
constant
though
slow
movement
and
the
particles
composing
it
are
thus
rubbed
together
by
these
means
fresh
surfaces
are
continually
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
soil
and
of
the
which
appear
to
be
still
more
efficient
in
the
decomposition
of
rocks
the
generation
of
the
is
probably
hastened
during
the
digestion
of
the
many
leaves
which
worms
consume
thus
the
particles
of
earth
forming
the
superficial
mould
are
subjected
to
conditions
eminently
favourable
for
their
decomposition
and
disintegration
moreover
the
particles
of
the
softer
rocks
suffer
some
amount
of
mechanical
trituration
in
the
muscular
gizzards
of
worms
in
which
small
stones
serve
as
the
finely
levigated
castings
when
brought
to
the
surface
in
a
moist
condition
flow
during
rainy
weather
down
any
moderate
slope
and
the
smaller
particles
are
washed
far
down
even
a
gently
inclined
surface
castings
when
dry
often
crumble
into
small
pellets
and
these
are
apt
to
roll
down
any
sloping
surface
where
the
land
is
quite
level
and
is
covered
with
herbage
and
where
the
climate
is
humid
so
that
much
dust
can
not
be
blown
away
it
appears
at
first
sight
impossible
that
there
should
be
any
appreciable
amount
of
denudation
but
are
blown
especially
whilst
moist
and
viscid
in
one
uniform
direction
by
the
prevalent
winds
which
are
accompanied
by
rain
by
these
several
means
the
superficial
mould
is
prevented
from
accumulating
to
a
great
thickness
and
a
thick
bed
of
mould
checks
in
many
ways
the
disintegration
of
the
underlying
rocks
and
fragments
of
rock
the
removal
of
by
the
above
means
leads
to
results
which
are
far
from
insignificant
it
has
been
shown
that
a
layer
of
earth
of
an
inch
in
thickness
is
in
many
places
annually
brought
to
the
surface
and
if
a
small
part
of
this
amount
flows
or
rolls
or
is
washed
even
for
a
short
distance
down
every
inclined
surface
or
is
repeatedly
blown
in
one
direction
a
great
effect
will
be
produced
in
the
course
of
ages
it
was
found
by
measurements
and
calculations
that
on
a
surface
with
a
mean
inclination
of
cubic
inches
of
earth
which
had
been
ejected
by
worms
crossed
in
the
course
of
a
year
a
horizontal
line
one
yard
in
length
so
that
cubic
inches
would
cross
a
line
yards
in
length
this
latter
amount
in
a
damp
state
would
weigh
pounds
thus
a
considerable
weight
of
earth
is
continually
moving
down
each
side
of
every
valley
and
will
in
time
reach
its
bed
finally
this
earth
will
be
transported
by
the
streams
flowing
in
the
valleys
into
the
ocean
the
great
receptacle
for
all
matter
denuded
from
the
land
it
is
known
from
the
amount
of
sediment
annually
delivered
into
the
sea
by
the
mississippi
that
its
enormous
must
on
an
average
be
lowered
of
an
inch
each
year
and
this
would
suffice
in
four
and
half
million
years
to
lower
the
whole
to
the
level
of
the
so
that
if
a
small
fraction
of
the
layer
of
fine
earth
of
an
inch
in
thickness
which
is
annually
brought
to
the
surface
by
worms
is
carried
away
a
great
result
can
not
fail
to
be
produced
within
a
period
which
no
geologist
considers
extremely
long
archæologists
ought
to
be
grateful
to
worms
as
they
protect
and
preserve
for
an
indefinitely
long
period
every
object
not
liable
to
decay
which
is
dropped
on
the
surface
of
the
land
by
burying
it
beneath
their
castings
thus
also
many
elegant
and
curious
tesselated
pavements
and
other
ancient
remains
have
been
preserved
though
no
doubt
the
worms
have
in
these
cases
been
largely
aided
by
earth
washed
and
blown
from
the
adjoining
land
especially
when
cultivated
the
old
tesselated
pavements
have
however
often
suffered
by
having
subsided
unequally
from
being
unequally
undermined
by
the
worms
even
old
massive
walls
may
be
undermined
and
subside
and
no
building
is
in
this
respect
safe
unless
the
foundations
lie
or
feet
beneath
the
surface
at
a
depth
at
which
worms
can
not
work
it
is
probable
that
many
monoliths
and
some
old
walls
have
fallen
down
from
having
been
undermined
by
worms
worms
prepare
the
ground
in
an
excellent
manner
for
the
growth
of
plants
and
for
seedlings
of
all
kinds
they
periodically
expose
the
mould
to
the
air
and
sift
it
so
that
no
stones
larger
than
the
particles
which
they
can
swallow
are
left
in
it
they
mingle
the
whole
intimately
together
like
a
gardener
who
prepares
fine
soil
for
his
choicest
plants
in
this
state
it
is
well
fitted
to
retain
moisture
and
to
absorb
all
soluble
substances
as
well
as
for
the
process
of
nitrification
the
bones
of
dead
animals
the
harder
parts
of
insects
the
shells
of
leaves
twigs
are
before
long
all
buried
beneath
the
accumulated
castings
of
worms
and
are
thus
brought
in
a
more
or
less
decayed
state
within
reach
of
the
roots
of
plants
worms
likewise
drag
an
infinite
number
of
dead
leaves
and
other
parts
of
plants
into
their
burrows
partly
for
the
sake
of
plugging
them
up
and
partly
as
food
the
leaves
which
are
dragged
into
the
burrows
as
food
after
being
torn
into
the
finest
shreds
partially
digested
and
saturated
with
the
intestinal
and
urinary
secretions
are
commingled
with
much
earth
this
earth
forms
the
dark
coloured
rich
humus
which
almost
everywhere
covers
the
surface
of
the
land
with
a
fairly
layer
or
mantle
hensen
placed
two
worms
in
a
vessel
inches
in
diameter
which
was
filled
with
sand
on
which
fallen
leaves
were
strewed
and
these
were
soon
dragged
into
their
burrows
to
a
depth
of
inches
after
about
weeks
an
almost
uniform
layer
of
sand
a
centimeter
inch
in
thickness
was
converted
into
humus
by
having
passed
through
the
alimentary
canals
of
these
two
worms
it
is
believed
by
some
persons
that
which
often
penetrate
the
ground
almost
perpendicularly
to
a
depth
of
or
feet
materially
aid
in
its
drainage
notwithstanding
that
the
viscid
castings
piled
over
the
mouths
of
the
burrows
prevent
or
check
the
directly
entering
them
they
allow
the
air
to
penetrate
deeply
into
the
ground
they
also
greatly
facilitate
the
downward
passage
of
roots
of
moderate
size
and
these
will
be
nourished
by
the
humus
with
which
the
burrows
are
lined
many
seeds
owe
their
germination
to
having
been
covered
by
castings
and
others
buried
to
a
considerable
depth
beneath
accumulated
castings
lie
dormant
until
at
some
future
time
they
are
accidentally
uncovered
and
germinate
worms
are
poorly
provided
with
for
they
can
not
be
said
to
see
although
they
can
just
distinguish
between
light
and
darkness
they
are
completely
deaf
and
have
only
a
feeble
power
of
smell
the
sense
of
touch
alone
is
well
developed
they
can
therefore
learn
but
little
about
the
outside
world
and
it
is
surprising
that
they
should
exhibit
some
skill
in
lining
their
burrows
with
their
castings
and
with
leaves
and
in
the
case
of
some
species
in
piling
up
their
castings
into
constructions
but
it
is
far
more
surprising
that
they
should
apparently
exhibit
some
degrees
of
intelligence
instead
of
a
mere
blind
instinctive
impulse
in
their
manner
of
plugging
up
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
they
act
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
would
a
man
who
had
to
close
a
cylindrical
tube
with
different
kinds
of
leaves
petioles
triangles
of
paper
for
they
commonly
seize
such
objects
by
their
pointed
ends
but
with
thin
objects
a
certain
number
are
drawn
in
by
their
broader
ends
they
do
not
act
in
the
same
unvarying
manner
in
all
cases
as
do
most
of
the
lower
animals
for
instance
they
do
not
drag
in
leaves
by
their
unless
the
basal
part
of
the
blade
is
as
narrow
as
the
apex
or
narrower
than
it
when
we
behold
a
wide
expanse
we
should
remember
that
its
smoothness
on
which
so
much
of
its
beauty
depends
is
mainly
due
to
all
the
inequalities
having
been
slowly
levelled
by
worms
it
is
a
marvellous
reflection
that
the
whole
of
the
superficial
mould
over
any
such
expanse
has
passed
and
will
again
pass
every
few
years
through
the
bodies
of
worms
the
plough
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
most
valuable
of
man
s
inventions
but
long
before
he
existed
the
land
was
in
fact
regularly
ploughed
and
still
continues
to
be
thus
ploughed
by
it
may
be
doubted
whether
there
are
many
other
animals
which
have
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
history
of
the
world
as
have
these
lowly
organized
creatures
some
other
animals
however
still
more
lowly
organized
namely
corals
have
done
far
more
conspicuous
work
in
having
constructed
innumerable
reefs
and
islands
in
the
great
oceans
but
these
are
almost
confined
to
the
tropical
zones

was

this
case
is
given
in
a
postscript
to
my
paper
in
the
transact
geolog
vol
and
contains
a
serious
error
as
in
the
account
received
i
mistook
the
figure
for
the
tenant
moreover
formerly
said
that
he
had
marled
the
field
thirty
years
before
but
was
now
positive
that
this
was
done
in
that
is
years
before
the
first
examination
of
the
field
by
my
friend
the
error
as
far
as
the
figure
is
concerned
was
corrected
in
an
article
by
me
in
the
gardeners
chronicle
these
pits
or
pipes
are
still
in
process
of
formation
during
the
last
forty
years
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
five
cases
in
which
a
circular
space
several
feet
in
diameter
suddenly
fell
in
leaving
on
the
field
an
open
hole
with
perpendicular
sides
some
feet
in
depth
this
occurred
in
one
of
my
own
fields
whilst
it
was
being
rolled
and
the
hinder
quarters
of
the
shaft
horse
fell
in
two
or
three
of
rubbish
were
required
to
fill
up
the
hole
the
subsidence
occurred
where
there
was
a
broad
depression
as
if
the
surface
had
fallen
in
at
several
former
periods
i
heard
of
a
hole
which
must
have
been
suddenly
formed
at
the
bottom
of
a
small
shallow
pool
where
sheep
had
been
washed
during
many
years
and
into
which
a
man
thus
occupied
fell
to
his
great
terror
the
over
this
whole
district
sinks
perpendicularly
into
the
ground
but
the
chalk
is
more
porous
in
certain
places
than
in
others
thus
the
drainage
from
the
overlying
clay
is
directed
to
certain
points
where
a
greater
amount
of
calcareous
matter
is
dissolved
than
elsewhere
even
narrow
open
channels
are
sometimes
formed
in
the
solid
chalk
as
the
chalk
is
slowly
dissolved
over
the
whole
country
but
more
in
some
parts
than
in
others
the
undissolved
is
the
overlying
mass
of
red
clay
with
flints
sinks
slowly
down
and
tends
to
fill
up
the
pipes
or
cavities
but
the
upper
part
of
the
red
clay
holds
together
aided
probably
by
the
roots
of
plants
for
a
longer
time
than
the
lower
parts
and
thus
forms
a
roof
which
sooner
or
later
falls
in
as
in
the
above
mentioned
five
cases
the
downward
movement
of
the
clay
may
be
compared
with
that
of
a
glacier
but
is
incomparably
slower
and
this
movement
accounts
for
a
singular
fact
namely
that
the
much
elongated
flints
which
are
embedded
in
the
chalk
in
a
nearly
horizontal
position
are
commonly
found
standing
nearly
or
quite
upright
in
the
red
clay
this
fact
is
so
common
that
the
workmen
assured
me
that
this
was
their
natural
position
i
roughly
measured
one
which
stood
vertically
and
it
was
of
the
same
length
and
of
the
same
relative
thickness
as
one
of
my
arms
these
elongated
flints
must
get
placed
in
their
upright
position
on
the
same
principle
that
a
trunk
of
a
tree
left
on
a
glacier
assumes
a
position
parallel
to
the
line
of
motion
the
flints
in
the
clay
which
form
almost
half
its
bulk
are
very
often
broken
though
not
rolled
or
abraded
and
this
may
be
accounted
for
by
their
mutual
pressure
whilst
the
whole
mass
is
subsiding
i
may
add
that
the
chalk
here
appears
to
have
been
originally
covered
in
parts
by
a
thin
bed
of
fine
sand
with
some
perfectly
rounded
flint
pebbles
probably
of
tertiary
age
for
such
sand
often
partly
fills
up
the
deeper
pits
or
cavities
in
the
chalk

the

be
this
conclusion
which
