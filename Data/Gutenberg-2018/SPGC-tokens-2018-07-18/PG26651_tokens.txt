but
now
his
turn
was
coming

sequence
of
things

of

that
afternoon
young
darragh
located
sard
office
and
presented
himself
as
a
customer
the
clerk
behind
the
wicket
laid
a
pistol
handy
and
informed
darragh
that
sard
was
away
on
a
business
trip
darragh
looked
cautiously
around
the
small
office
can
anybody
hear
us
nobody
why
i
have
important
news
concerning
josé
quintana
whispered
darragh
where
is
sard
why
he
had
a
letter
from
quintana
this
very
morning
replied
the
clerk
in
a
low
uneasy
voice
sard
left
for
albany
on
the
one
train
is
there
any
trouble
plenty
replied
darragh
coolly
do
you
know
quintana
no
but
sard
expects
him
here
any
day
now
darragh
leaned
closer
against
the
grille
listen
very
carefully
if
a
man
comes
here
who
calls
himself
josé
quintana
turn
him
over
to
the
police
until
sard
returns
no
matter
what
he
tells
you
turn
him
over
to
the
police
do
you
understand
who
are
you
demanded
the
worried
clerk
are
you
one
of
people
young
man
said
darragh
i
close
enough
to
quintana
to
give
orders
and
give
sard
orders
and
quintana
too
a
great
light
dawned
on
the
scared
clerk
are
josé
quintana
he
said
hoarsely
darragh
bored
him
through
with
his
dark
stare
mind
your
business
he
said
that
night
in
albany
darragh
picked
up
sard
trail
it
led
to
a
dealer
in
automobiles
sard
had
bought
a
comet
six
paying
cash
and
had
started
north
through
schenectady
fonda
and
mayfield
the
following
day
darragh
traced
a
brand
new
comet
six
containing
one
short
dark
levantine
with
a
parrot
nose
in
northville
darragh
hired
a
ford
at
lake
pleasant
sard
car
went
wrong
darragh
missed
him
by
ten
minutes
but
he
learned
that
sard
had
inquired
the
way
to
ghost
lake
inn
that
was
sufficient
darragh
bought
an
axe
drove
as
far
as
corners
dismissed
the
ford
and
walked
into
a
forest
entirely
familiar
to
him
he
emerged
in
half
an
hour
on
a
wood
road
two
miles
farther
on
here
he
felled
a
tree
across
the
road
and
sat
down
in
the
bushes
to
await
events
toward
sunset
hearing
a
car
coming
he
tied
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
below
the
eyes
and
took
an
automatic
from
his
pocket
sard
car
stopped
and
sard
got
out
to
inspect
the
obstruction
darragh
sauntered
out
of
the
bushes
poked
his
pistol
against
sard
fat
abdomen
and
leisurely
and
thoroughly
robbed
him
in
an
agreeable
spot
near
a
brook
darragh
lighted
his
pipe
and
sat
him
down
to
examine
the
booty
in
detail
two
pistols
a
stiletto
and
a
blackjack
composed
the
arsenal
of
sard
a
large
wallet
disclosed
more
than
four
thousand
dollars
in
treasury
notes
something
to
reimburse
ricca
when
she
arrived
he
thought
among
sard
papers
he
discovered
a
cipher
letter
from
rotterdam
probably
from
quintana
cipher
was
rather
in
darragh
line
all
ciphers
are
solved
by
similar
methods
unless
the
key
is
contained
in
a
code
book
known
only
to
sender
and
receiver
but
quintana
cipher
proved
to
be
only
an
easy
acrostic
the
very
simplest
of
secret
messages
within
an
hour
darragh
had
it
pencilled
out
take
notice
star
pond
y
name
is
mike
clinch
has
flaming
jewel
erosite
i
sail
at
once
quintana
having
served
in
russia
as
an
officer
in
the
military
intelligence
department
attached
to
the
american
expeditionary
forces
darragh
had
little
trouble
with
quintana
letter
even
the
signature
was
not
difficult
the
fraction
was
easily
translated
and
the
familiar
prescription
symbol
spelled
which
gave
quintana
name
in
full
he
had
heard
of
erosite
as
the
rarest
and
most
magnificent
of
all
gems
only
three
were
known
the
young
duchess
theodorica
of
esthonia
had
possessed
one
darragh
was
immensely
amused
to
find
that
the
chase
after
emanuel
sard
should
have
led
him
to
the
very
borders
of
the
great
harrod
estate
in
the
adirondacks
he
gathered
up
his
loot
and
walked
on
through
the
splendid
forest
which
once
had
belonged
to
henry
harrod
of
boston
and
which
now
was
the
property
of
harrod
nephew
james
darragh
when
he
came
to
the
first
trespass
notice
he
stood
a
moment
to
read
it
then
slowly
he
turned
and
looked
toward
clinch
an
autumn
sunset
flared
like
a
conflagration
through
the
pines
there
was
a
glimmer
of
water
too
where
star
pond
lay
fate
chance
and
destiny
were
becoming
very
busy
with
mike
clinch
they
had
started
quintana
sard
and
darragh
on
his
trail
now
they
stirred
up
the
sovereign
state
of
new
york
that
lank
wolf
justice
was
afoot
and
sniffing
uncomfortably
close
to
the
heels
of
mike
clinch
ii
two
state
troopers
drew
bridles
in
the
yellowing
october
forest
their
smart
drab
uniforms
touched
with
purple
blended
harmoniously
with
the
autumn
woods
they
were
as
inconspicuous
as
two
deer
in
the
dappled
shadow
there
was
a
sunny
clearing
just
ahead
the
wood
road
they
had
been
travelling
entered
it
beyond
lay
star
pond
trooper
lannis
said
to
trooper
stormont
that
mike
clinch
clearing
our
man
may
be
there
now
we
see
if
anybody
tips
him
off
this
time
forest
and
clearing
were
very
still
in
the
sunshine
nothing
stirred
save
gold
leaves
drifting
down
and
a
hawk
high
in
the
deep
blue
sky
turning
in
narrow
circles
lannis
was
instructing
stormont
who
had
been
transferred
from
the
long
island
troop
and
who
was
unacquainted
with
local
matters
lannis
said
clinch
dump
stands
on
the
other
edge
of
the
clearing
clinch
owns
five
hundred
acres
in
here
he
a
rat
bad
well
he
mean
i
do
know
how
bad
he
is
but
he
runs
a
rotten
dump
the
forest
has
its
slums
as
well
as
the
city
this
is
the
hell
kitchen
of
the
north
woods
stormont
nodded
all
the
scum
of
the
wilderness
gathers
here
went
on
lannis
where
half
the
trouble
in
the
north
woods
hatches
we
eat
dinner
at
clinch
his
stepdaughter
is
a
peach
the
sturdy
trooper
glanced
at
his
wrist
watch
stretched
his
legs
in
his
stirrups
jack
he
said
i
want
you
to
get
clinch
right
and
i
going
to
tell
you
about
his
outfit
while
we
watch
this
road
it
like
a
movie
clinch
plays
the
lead
i
dope
out
the
scenario
for
you
he
turned
sideways
in
his
saddle
freeing
both
spurred
heels
and
lolled
so
constructing
a
cigarette
while
he
talked
way
back
around
mike
clinch
was
a
guide
a
decent
young
fellow
they
say
he
guided
fishing
parties
in
summer
hunters
in
fall
and
winter
he
made
money
and
built
the
house
the
people
he
guided
were
wealthy
he
made
a
lot
of
money
and
bought
land
i
understand
he
was
square
and
that
everybody
liked
him
about
that
time
there
came
to
clinch
a
and
strayer
they
were
strayer
seemed
to
be
a
gentleman
his
wife
was
good
looking
and
rather
common
both
were
very
young
he
had
the
consump
bad
the
galloping
variety
he
did
last
long
a
month
after
he
died
his
young
wife
had
a
baby
clinch
married
her
she
also
died
the
same
year
the
baby
name
was
eve
clinch
became
quite
crazy
about
her
and
started
to
make
a
lady
of
her
that
was
his
mania
lannis
leaned
from
his
saddle
and
carefully
dropped
his
cigarette
end
into
a
puddle
of
rain
water
then
he
swung
one
leg
over
and
sat
side
saddle
clinch
had
plenty
of
money
in
those
days
he
went
on
he
could
afford
to
educate
the
child
the
kid
had
a
governess
then
he
sent
her
to
a
fancy
boarding
school
she
had
everything
a
young
girl
could
want
she
developed
into
a
pretty
young
thing
at
fifteen
she
eighteen
now
and
i
do
know
what
to
call
her
she
pulled
a
gun
on
me
in
july
what
sure
there
was
a
row
at
clinch
dump
a
called
jake
kloon
got
shot
up
i
came
up
to
get
clinch
he
was
in
his
bunk
when
i
broke
in
the
door
eve
strayer
pulled
a
gun
on
me
what
happened
inquired
stormont
nothing
i
took
clinch
but
he
got
off
as
usual
acquitted
lannis
nodded
rolling
another
cigarette
now
i
tell
you
how
clinch
happened
to
go
wrong
he
said
you
see
he
always
made
his
living
by
guiding
well
some
years
ago
henry
harrod
of
boston
came
here
and
bought
thousands
and
thousands
of
acres
of
forest
all
around
clinch
lannis
half
rose
on
one
stirrup
and
with
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
his
muscular
arm
ending
in
a
flourish
he
bought
everything
for
miles
and
miles
and
that
started
clinch
down
hill
harrod
tried
to
force
clinch
to
sell
the
millionaire
tactics
you
know
he
was
determined
to
oust
him
clinch
got
mad
and
sell
at
any
price
harrod
kept
on
buying
all
around
clinch
and
posted
trespass
notices
that
meant
ruin
to
clinch
he
was
walled
in
no
hunters
care
to
be
restricted
clinch
little
property
was
no
good
business
stopped
his
stepdaughter
education
became
expensive
he
was
in
a
bad
way
harrod
offered
him
a
big
price
but
clinch
turned
ugly
and
would
budge
and
that
how
clinch
began
to
go
wrong
poor
devil
said
stormont
devil
all
right
poor
too
but
he
needed
money
he
was
crazy
to
make
a
lady
of
eve
strayer
and
there
are
ways
of
finding
money
you
know
stormont
nodded
well
clinch
found
money
in
those
ways
the
conservation
commissioner
in
albany
began
to
hear
about
game
law
violations
the
revenue
people
heard
of
clinch
lost
his
guide
license
but
nobody
could
get
the
goods
on
him
there
was
a
rough
backwoods
bunch
always
drifting
about
clinch
place
in
those
days
there
were
fights
and
not
so
many
miles
from
there
was
highway
robbery
and
a
murder
or
two
then
the
war
came
the
draft
caught
clinch
malone
exempted
him
he
being
the
sole
support
of
his
stepchild
but
the
girl
volunteered
she
got
to
france
somehow
scrubbed
in
a
hospital
i
believe
anyway
clinch
wanted
to
be
on
the
same
side
of
the
world
she
was
on
and
he
went
with
a
forestry
regiment
and
cut
trees
for
railroad
ties
in
southern
france
until
the
war
ended
and
they
sent
him
home
eve
strayer
came
back
too
she
there
now
you
see
her
at
dinner
time
she
sticks
to
clinch
he
a
rat
he
up
against
the
dry
laws
and
the
game
laws
government
enforcement
agents
game
protectors
state
constabulary
all
keep
an
eye
on
clinch
harrod
trespass
signs
fence
him
in
he
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
yet
clinch
makes
money
at
law
breaking
and
nobody
can
catch
him
he
kills
harrod
deer
that
certain
i
mean
harrod
nephew
deer
harrod
dead
darragh
the
young
nephew
name
he
never
been
here
he
was
in
the
army
in
russia
i
do
know
what
became
of
him
but
he
keeps
up
the
harrod
preserve
patrols
watchers
trespass
signs
and
all
lannis
finished
his
second
cigarette
got
back
into
his
stirrups
and
gathering
bridle
began
leisurely
to
divide
curb
and
snaffle
that
the
layout
jack
he
said
yonder
lies
the
red
light
district
of
the
north
woods
mike
clinch
is
the
brains
of
all
the
dirty
work
that
goes
on
a
floating
population
of
crooks
and
bums
game
violators
market
hunters
pelt
hootch
makers
do
his
dirty
work
and
i
guess
there
are
some
who
stick
you
up
by
starlight
for
a
quarter
and
others
who
knock
your
block
off
for
a
dollar
and
there
the
girl
eve
strayer
i
do
get
her
at
all
except
that
she
loyal
to
clinch
and
now
you
know
what
you
ought
to
know
about
this
movie
called
in
the
woods
and
it
up
to
us
to
keep
a
calm
impartial
eye
on
the
picture
and
try
to
follow
the
plot
they
acting
out
if
there
is
any
stormont
said
thanks
bill
i
posted
and
i
getting
hungry
too
i
believe
said
lannis
that
you
want
to
see
that
girl
i
do
returned
the
other
laughing
well
you
see
her
she
good
to
look
at
but
i
do
get
her
at
all
why
because
she
right
and
yet
she
lives
at
clinch
with
him
and
his
bunch
of
bums
would
you
think
a
straight
girl
could
stand
it
no
man
can
tell
what
a
straight
girl
can
stand
straight
or
crooked
she
stands
for
mike
clinch
said
lannis
and
a
ratty
customer
maybe
the
girl
is
fond
of
him
it
natural
i
guess
it
that
but
i
do
see
how
any
young
girl
can
stomach
the
life
at
clinch
it
a
wonder
what
a
decent
woman
will
stand
observed
stormont
per
cent
of
all
wives
ought
to
receive
the
s
o
do
you
think
we
so
rotten
inquired
lannis
smiling
not
so
rotten
no
but
any
man
knows
what
men
are
and
it
a
wonder
women
stick
to
us
when
they
learn
they
laughed
lannis
glanced
at
his
watch
again
well
he
said
i
do
believe
anybody
has
tipped
off
our
man
noon
come
on
to
dinner
jack
they
cantered
forward
into
the
sunlit
clearing
star
pond
lay
ahead
on
its
edge
stood
clinch
iii
clinch
in
his
shirt
sleeves
came
out
on
the
veranda
he

lannis
in
his
genial
way
pleased
to
know

said
clinch
unstirring
the
troopers
dismounted
both
shook
hands
with
clinch
then
lannis
led
the
way
to
the
barn

eat
well
he
remarked
to
his
comrade
clinch
cooks
from
the
care
of
their
horses
they
went
to
a
pump
to
one
or
two
rough
looking
men
slouched
out
of
the
house
and
glanced
at
them
hallo
jake
said
lannis
cheerily
jake
kloon
grunted
acknowledgment
lannis
said
in
stormont
ear
here
she
comes
with
towels
pretty
is
she
a
young
girl
in
pink
gingham
advanced
toward
them
across
the
patch
of
grass
lannis
was
very
polite
and
presented
stormont
the
girl
handed
them
two
rough
towels
glanced
at
stormont
again
after
the
introduction
smiled
slightly
dinner
is
ready
she
said
they
dried
their
faces
and
followed
her
back
to
the
house
it
was
an
unpainted
building
partly
of
log
in
the
dining
room
half
a
dozen
men
waited
silently
for
food
lannis
saluted
all
named
his
comrade
and
seated
himself
a
delicious
odour
of
pervaded
the
room
presently
eve
strayer
appeared
with
the
dinner
there
was
dew
on
her
pale
forehead
the
heat
of
the
kitchen
no
doubt
the
girl
thick
lustrous
hair
was
brownish
gold
and
so
twisted
up
that
it
revealed
her
ears
and
a
very
white
neck
when
she
brought
stormont
his
dinner
he
caught
her
eyes
a
moment
experienced
a
slight
shock
of
pleasure
at
their
intense
blue
the
of
the
summer
zenith
at
midday
lannis
remained
affable
even
became
jocose
at
moments
no
hootch
for
dinner
mike
how
that
now
the
express
is
a
day
late
replied
clinch
with
cold
humour
around
the
table
ran
an
odd
sound
a
company
of
catamounts
feeding
might
have
made
such
a
noise
if
catamounts
ever
laugh
how
the
fur
market
jake
inquired
lannis
pouring
gravy
over
his
mashed
potato
kloon
quoted
prices
with
an
oath
a
young
man
named
leverett
complained
of
the
price
of
traps
what
do
you
care
inquired
lannis
genially
the
other
man
pays
what
are
you
kicking
about
anyway
it
was
so
long
ago
that
muskrats
were
ten
cents
the
trooper
intimation
that
earl
leverett
took
fur
in
other
men
traps
was
not
lost
on
the
company
leverett
fox
visage
reddened
jake
kloon
who
had
only
one
eye
glared
at
the
state
trooper
but
said
nothing
clinch
pale
gaze
met
the
trooper
smiling
one
the
jays
and
squirrels
talk
too
he
said
slowly
it
do
mean
anything
only
the
counts
you
quite
right
clinch
the
is
what
we
pay
to
see
but
talk
is
the
tune
the
orchestra
plays
before
the
curtain
rises
stormont
had
finished
dinner
he
heard
a
low
charming
voice
from
behind
his
chair
apple
pie
lemon
pie
maple
cake
berry
roll
he
looked
up
into
two
eyes
lemon
pie
please
he
said
blushing
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
bare
little
dining
room
empty
except
for
clinch
and
the
two
state
troopers
the
former
folded
his
heavy
powerful
hands
on
the
table
edge
and
turned
his
square
face
and
gaze
on
lannis
spit
it
out
he
said
in
a
passionless
voice
lannis
crossed
one
knee
over
the
other
lighted
a
cigarette
is
there
a
young
fellow
working
for
you
named
hal
smith
no
said
clinch
sure
sure
clinch
continued
lannis
have
you
heard
about
a
on
the
out
of
ghost
lake
no
well
a
wealthy
tourist
from
new
york
a
sard
stopping
at
ghost
lake
inn
was
held
up
and
robbed
last
saturday
toward
sundown

of
him
said
clinch
calmly
the
robber
took
four
thousand
dollars
in
bills
and
some
private
papers
from
him
it
no
skin
off
my
shins
remarked
clinch
he
laid
a
complaint
yes
have
any
strangers
been
here
since
saturday
evening
no
there
was
a
pause
we
heard
you
had
a
new
man
named
hal
smith
working
around
your
place
no
he
came
here
saturday
night
who
says
so
a
guide
from
ghost
lake
he
a
liar
you
know
said
lannis
it
wo
do
you
any
good
if
men
can
hide
here
and
make
a
getaway
and
search
said
clinch
calmly
they
searched
the
hotel
from
garret
to
cellar
they
searched
the
barn
while
this
was
going
on
clinch
went
into
the
kitchen
eve
he
said
coolly
the
state
troopers
are
after
that
fellow
hal
smith
who
came
here
saturday
night
where
is
he
he
went
into
harrod
to
get
us
a
deer
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
what
has
he
done
stuck
up
a
man
on
the
ghost
lake
road
he
ought
to
have
told
me
do
you
think
you
could
meet
up
with
him
and
tip
him
off
he
hunting
on
owl
marsh
i
try
all
right
change
your
clothes
and
slip
out
the
back
door
and
look
out
for
harrod
patrols
too
all
right
dad
she
said
if
i
have
to
be
out
do
worry
i
get
word
to
smith
somehow
half
an
hour
later
lannis
and
stormont
returned
from
a
prowl
around
the
clearing
lannis
paid
the
reckoning
his
comrade
led
out
the
horses
he
said
again
to
lannis
i
sure
it
was
the
girl
she
wore
men
clothes
and
she
went
into
the
woods
on
a
run
as
they
started
to
ride
away
lannis
said
to
clinch
who
stood
on
the
veranda
it
still
and
squirrel
talk
between
us
mike
but
the
is
sure
to
come
better
go
straight
while
the
going
good
i
go
straight
enough
to
suit
me
said
clinch
but
it
the
government
that
is
to
be
suited
mike
and
if
it
gets
you
right
you
be
in
dutch
do
let
that
worry
you
said
clinch
about
three
the
two
state
troopers
riding
at
a
walk
came
to
the
forks
of
the
ghost
lake
road
now
said
lannis
to
stormont
if
you
really
believe
you
saw
the
girl
beat
it
out
of
the
back
door
and
take
to
the
woods
she
probably
somewhere
in
there
he
pointed
into
the
western
forest
but
he
added
what
your
idea
in
following
her
she
wore
men
clothes
she
was
in
a
hurry
and
trying
to
keep
out
of
sight
i
wondered
whether
clinch
might
have
sent
her
to
warn
this
fellow
that
rather
a
long
shot
is
it
very
long
i
could
go
in
and
look
about
a
bit
if
you
lead
my
horse
all
right
take
your
bearings
this
road
runs
west
to
ghost
lake
we
sleep
at
the
inn
there
if
you
mean
to
cross
the
woods
on
foot
stormont
nodded
consulted
his
map
and
compass
pocketed
both
unbuckled
his
spurs
when
he
was
ready
he
gave
his
bridle
to
lannis
i
just
like
to
see
what
she
up
to
he
remarked
all
right
if
you
miss
me
come
to
the
inn
said
lannis
starting
on
with
the
led
horse
the
forest
was
open
amid
a
big
stand
of
white
pine
and
hemlock
and
stormont
travelled
easily
and
swiftly
he
had
struck
a
line
by
compass
that
must
cross
the
direction
taken
by
eve
strayer
when
she
left
clinch
but
it
was
a
wild
chance
that
he
would
ever
run
across
her
and
probably
he
never
would
have
if
the
man
that
she
was
looking
for
had
not
fired
a
shot
on
the
edge
of
that
vast
maze
of
stream
morass
and
dead
timber
called
owl
marsh
far
away
in
the
open
forest
stormont
heard
the
shot
and
turned
in
that
direction
but
eve
already
was
very
near
when
the
young
man
who
called
himself
hal
smith
fired
at
one
of
harrod
deer
a
buck
on
the
edge
of
the
dead
water
smith
had
drawn
and
dressed
the
buck
by
the
time
the
girl
found
him
he
was
cleaning
up
when
she
arrived
squatting
by
the
water
edge
when
he
heard
her
voice
across
the
swale
smith
the
state
troopers
are
looking
for
you
he
stood
up
dried
his
hands
on
his
breeches
the
girl
picked
her
way
across
the
bog
jumping
from
one
tussock
to
the
next
when
she
told
him
what
had
happened
he
began
to
laugh
did
you
really
stick
up
this
man
she
asked
incredulously
i
afraid
i
did
eve
he
replied
still
laughing
the
girl
entire
expression
altered
so
that
the
sort
you
are
she
said
i
thought
you
different
but
you
all
a
rotten
lot
hold
on
he
interrupted
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
the
only
men
who
ever
come
to
star
pond
are
crooks
she
retorted
bitterly
i
did
believe
you
were
you
look
decent
but
you
as
crooked
as
the
rest
of
them
and
it
seems
as
if
i
i
stand
it
any
longer
if
you
think
me
so
rotten
why
did
you
run
all
the
way
from
clinch
to
warn
me
he
asked
curiously
i
did
do
it
for
i
did
it
for
my
father
they
jail
him
if
they
catch
him
hiding
you
they
got
it
in
for
him
if
they
put
him
in
prison
he
die
he
could
stand
it
i
and
that
why
i
came
to
find
you
and
tell
you
to
clear
out
the
distant
crack
of
a
dry
stick
checked
her
the
next
instant
she
picked
up
his
rifle
seized
his
arm
and
fairly
dragged
him
into
a
spruce
thicket
do
you
want
to
get
my
father
into
trouble
she
said
fiercely
the
rocky
flank
of
star
peak
bordered
the
marsh
here
come
on
she
whispered
jerking
him
along
through
the
thicket
and
up
the
rocks
to
a
cleft
a
hole
in
the
sheer
rock
overhung
by
shaggy
hemlock
get
in
there
she
said
breathlessly
whoever
comes
he
protested
will
see
the
buck
yonder
and
will
certainly
look
in
here
not
if
i
go
down
there
and
take
your
medicine
creep
into
that
cave
and
lie
down
what
do
you
intend
to
do
he
demanded
interested
and
amused
if
it
one
of
harrod
said
the
girl
drily
it
only
means
a
summons
and
a
fine
for
me
and
if
it
a
state
trooper
who
is
prowling
in
the
woods
yonder
hunting
crooks
he
find
nobody
here
but
a
trespasser
keep
quiet
i
stand
him
off
iv
when
state
trooper
stormont
came
out
on
the
edge
of
owl
marsh
the
girl
was
kneeling
by
the
water
washing
deer
blood
from
her
slender
fingers
what
are
you
doing
here
she
enquired
looking
up
over
her
shoulder
with
a
slight
smile
just
having
a
look
around
he
said
pleasantly
that
a
nice
fat
buck
you
have
there
yes
he
nice
you
shot
him
asked
stormont
who
else
do
you
suppose
shot
him
she
enquired
smilingly
she
rinsed
her
fingers
again
and
stood
up
swinging
her
arms
to
dry
her
hands
a
lithe
figure
in
her
boyish
garments
straight
supple
and
strong
i
saw
you
hurrying
into
the
woods
said
stormont
yes
i
was
in
a
hurry
we
need
meat
i
did
notice
that
you
carried
a
rifle
when
i
saw
you
leave
the
house
by
the
back
door
no
it
was
in
the
woods
she
said
indifferently
you
have
a
hiding
place
for
your
rifle
for
other
things
also
she
said
letting
her
eyes
of
rest
on
the
young
man
you
seem
to
be
very
secretive
is
a
girl
more
so
than
a
man
she
asked
smilingly
stormont
smiled
too
then
became
grave
who
else
was
here
with
you
he
asked
quietly
she
seemed
surprised
did
you
see
anybody
else
he
hesitated
flushed
pointed
down
at
the
wet
sphagnum
were
there
in
damning
contrast
to
her
own
worse
than
that
smith
pipe
lay
on
an
embedded
log
and
a
rubber
tobacco
pouch
beside
it
she
said
with
a
slight
catch
in
her
breath
it
seems
that
somebody
has
been
here
some
hunter
perhaps
or
a
game
warden
or
hal
smith
said
stormont
a
painful
colour
swept
the
girl
face
and
throat
the
man
sorry
for
her
looked
away
after
a
silence
i
know
something
about
you
he
said
gently
and
now
that
i
seen
you
heard
you
speak
met
your
eyes
i
know
enough
about
you
to
form
an
opinion
so
i
do
ask
you
to
turn
informer
but
the
law
wo
stand
for
what
clinch
is
doing
whatever
provocation
he
has
had
and
he
must
not
aid
or
abet
any
criminal
or
harbour
any
malefactor
the
girl
features
were
expressionless
the
passive
sullen
beauty
of
her
troubled
the
trooper
trouble
for
clinch
means
sorrow
for
you
he
said
i
do
want
you
to
be
unhappy
i
bear
clinch
no
ill
will
for
this
reason
i
ask
him
and
i
ask
you
too
to
stand
clear
of
this
affair
hal
smith
is
wanted
i
here
to
take
him
as
she
said
nothing
he
looked
down
at
the
in
the
sphagnum
then
his
eyes
moved
to
the
next
imprint
to
the
next
then
he
moved
slowly
along
the
water
edge
tracking
the
course
of
the
man
he
was
following
the
girl
watched
him
in
silence
until
the
plain
trail
led
him
to
the
spruce
thicket
do
go
in
there
she
said
sharply
with
an
odd
tremor
in
her
voice
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
then
stepped
calmly
into
the
thicket
and
the
next
instant
she
was
among
the
spruces
too
confronting
him
with
her
rifle
get
out
of
these
woods
she
said
he
looked
into
the
girl
deathly
white
face
eve
he
said
it
will
go
hard
with
you
if
you
kill
me
i
do
want
you
to
live
out
your
life
in
prison
i
ca
help
it
if
you
send
my
father
to
prison
he
die
i
rather
die
myself
let
us
alone
i
tell
you
the
man
you
after
is
nothing
to
us
we
did
know
he
had
stuck
up
anybody
if
he
nothing
to
you
why
do
you
point
that
rifle
at
me
i
tell
you
he
is
nothing
to
us
but
my
father
would
betray
a
dog
and
i
wo
that
all
now
get
out
of
these
woods
and
come
back
nobody
interfere
with
you
then
stormont
smiled
eve
he
said
do
you
really
think
me
as
yellow
as
that
her
blue
eyes
flashed
a
terrible
warning
but
in
the
same
instant
he
had
caught
her
rifle
twisting
it
out
of
her
grasp
as
it
exploded
the
detonation
dazed
her
then
as
he
flung
the
rifle
into
the
water
she
caught
him
by
neck
and
belt
and
flung
him
bodily
into
the
spruces
but
she
fell
with
him
he
held
her
twisting
and
struggling
with
all
her
superb
and
supple
strength
staggered
to
his
feet
still
mastering
her
and
as
she
struggled
sobbing
locked
hot
and
panting
in
his
arms
he
snapped
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
her
wrists
and
flung
her
aside
she
fell
on
both
knees
got
up
shoulder
deep
in
spruce
blood
running
from
her
lip
over
her
chin
the
trooper
took
her
by
the
arm
she
was
trembling
all
over
he
took
a
thin
steel
chain
and
padlock
from
his
pocket
passed
the
links
around
her
wrists
and
fastened
her
to
a
young
birch
tree
then
drawing
his
pistol
from
its
holster
he
went
swiftly
forward
through
the
spruces
when
he
saw
the
cleft
in
the
rocky
flank
of
star
peak
he
walked
straight
to
the
black
hole
which
confronted
him
come
out
of
there
he
said
distinctly
after
a
few
seconds
smith
came
out
good
god
said
stormont
in
a
low
voice
what
are
you
doing
here
darragh

close
and
rested
one
hand
on
stormont
shoulder

to
that
girl
and

a
slight
smile
touched
their
eyes
both
instinctively
saluted
then
they
shook
hands
darragh
alias
hal
smith
went
back
into
the
hole
in
the
rocks
trooper
stormont
walked
slowly
down
through
the
spruces
when
eve
saw
him
returning
empty
handed
something
flashed
in
her
pallid
face
like
sunlight
across
snow
stormont
passed
her
went
to
the
water
edge
soaked
a
spicy
handful
of
sphagnum
moss
in
the
icy
water
came
back
and
wiped
the
blood
from
her
face
the
girl
seemed
astounded
her
face
surged
in
vivid
colour
as
he
unlocked
the
handcuffs
and
pocketed
them
and
the
little
steel
chain
her
lip
was
bleeding
again
he
washed
it
with
wet
moss
took
a
clean
handkerchief
from
the
breast
of
his
tunic
and
laid
it
against
her
mouth
hold
it
there
he
said
mechanically
she
raised
her
hand
to
support
the
compress
stormont
went
back
to
the
shore
recovered
her
rifle
from
the
shallow
water
and
returned
with
it
as
she
made
no
motion
to
take
it
he
stood
it
against
the
tree
to
which
he
had
tied
her
then
he
came
close
to
her
where
she
stood
holding
his
handkerchief
against
her
mouth
and
looking
at
him
out
of
steady
eyes
as
deeply
blue
as
gentian
blossoms
eve
he
said
you
win
but
you
wo
forgive
me
i
wish
we
could
be
friends
some
day
we
never
can
now
neither
spoke
again
then
of
a
sudden
the
girl
eyes
filled
and
trooper
stormont
caught
her
free
hand
and
kissed
it
kissed
it
again
and
again
dropped
it
and
went
striding
away
through
the
underbrush
which
was
now
all
rosy
with
the
rays
of
sunset
after
he
had
disappeared
the
girl
eve
went
to
the
cleft
in
the
rocks
above
come
out
she
said
contemptuously
it
a
good
thing
you
hid
because
there
was
a
real
man
after
you
and
god
help
you
if
he
ever
finds
you
hal
smith
came
out
pack
in
your
meat
said
the
girl
curtly
and
flung
his
rifle
across
her
shoulder
through
the
ruddy
afterglow
she
led
the
way
homeward
a
handkerchief
pressed
to
her
wounded
mouth
her
eyes
preoccupied
with
the
strangest
thoughts
that
ever
had
stirred
her
virgin
mind
behind
her
walked
darragh
with
his
load
of
venison
and
his
alias
and
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
thus
began
the
preliminaries
toward
the
ultimate
undoing
of
mike
clinch
fate
chance
and
destiny
had
undertaken
the
job
in
earnest
episode
two
the
ruling
passion
i
nobody
understood
how
josé
quintana
had
slipped
through
the
secret
service
net
spread
for
him
at
every
port
the
united
states
authorities
did
not
know
why
quintana
had
come
to
america
they
realised
merely
that
he
arrived
for
no
good
purpose
and
they
had
meant
to
arrest
and
hold
him
for
extradition
if
requested
for
deportation
as
an
undesirable
alien
anyway
only
two
men
in
america
knew
that
quintana
had
come
to
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
recovering
the
famous
flaming
jewel
stolen
by
him
from
the
grand
duchess
theodorica
of
esthonia
and
stolen
from
quintana
in
turn
by
a
private
soldier
in
an
american
forestry
regiment
on
leave
in
paris
this
soldier
name
probably
was
michael
clinch
one
of
the
men
who
knew
why
quintana
might
come
to
america
was
james
darragh
recently
of
the
military
intelligence
but
now
passing
as
a
man
under
the
name
of
hal
smith
and
actually
in
the
employment
of
clinch
at
his
disreputable
hotel
at
star
pond
in
the
north
woods
the
other
man
who
knew
why
quintana
had
come
to
america
was
emanuel
sard
a
levantine
diamond
broker
of
new
york
quintana
agent
in
america
now
as
the
october
days
passed
without
any
report
of
detention
darragh
known
as
hal
smith
at
clinch
dump
began
to
suspect
that
quintana
had
already
slid
into
america
through
the
meshes
of
the
police
if
so
this
desperate
international
criminal
could
be
expected
at
clinch
under
some
guise
or
other
piloted
thither
by
emanuel
sard
so
hal
smith
whose
duty
was
to
wash
dishes
do
chores
and
also
to
supply
clinch
with
mountain
beef
or
deer
taken
illegally
made
it
convenient
to
prowl
every
day
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ghost
lake
road
he
was
perfectly
familiar
with
emanuel
sard
squat
features
and
parrot
nose
having
robbed
sard
of
quintana
cipher
and
of
at
pistol
point
and
one
morning
while
roving
around
the
guide
quarters
at
ghost
lake
inn
smith
beheld
sard
himself
on
the
hotel
veranda
in
company
with
five
strangers
of
foreign
aspect
during
the
midday
dinner
smith
on
pretense
of
enquiring
for
a
license
got
a
look
at
the
inn
ledger
sard
signature
was
on
it
followed
by
the
names
of
henri
picquet
nicolas
salzar
victor
georgiades
harry
beck
and
josé
sanchez
and
smith
went
back
through
the
wilderness
to
star
pond
convinced
that
one
of
these
gentlemen
was
quintana
and
the
remainder
quintana
gang
and
that
they
were
here
to
do
murder
if
necessary
in
their
remorseless
quest
of
the
flaming
jewel
two
million
dollars
once
had
been
offered
for
the
flaming
jewel
and
had
been
refused
clinch
probably
possessed
it
smith
was
now
convinced
of
that
but
he
was
there
to
rob
clinch
of
it
himself
for
he
had
promised
the
little
grand
duchess
to
help
recover
her
erosite
jewel
and
now
that
he
had
finally
traced
its
probable
possession
to
clinch
he
was
wondering
how
this
recovery
was
to
be
accomplished
to
arrest
clinch
meant
ruin
to
eve
strayer
besides
he
knew
now
that
clinch
would
die
in
prison
before
revealing
the
hiding
place
of
the
flaming
jewel
also
how
could
it
be
proven
that
clinch
had
the
erosite
gem
the
cipher
from
quintana
was
not
sufficient
evidence
no
the
only
way
was
to
watch
clinch
prevent
any
robbery
by
gang
somehow
discover
where
the
flaming
jewel
had
been
concealed
take
it
and
restore
it
to
the
beggared
young
girl
whose
only
financial
resource
now
lay
in
the
possible
recovery
of
this
almost
priceless
gem
toward
evening
hal
smith
shot
two
deer
near
owl
marsh
to
poach
on
his
own
property
appealed
to
his
sense
of
humour
and
clinch
never
dreaming
that
hal
smith
was
the
james
darragh
who
had
inherited
harrod
vast
preserve
damned
all
millionaires
for
every
buck
brought
in
and
became
friendlier
to
smith
ii
clinch
dump
was
the
disposal
plant
in
which
collected
the
human
sewage
of
the
wilderness
it
being
saturday
the
scum
of
the
north
woods
was
gathering
at
the
star
pond
resort
a
venison
and
chicken
supper
was
promised
and
a
dance
if
any
women
appeared
jake
kloon
had
run
in
some
canadian
hooch
darragh
alias
hal
smith
contributed
two
fat
deer
and
clinch
cooked
them
by
ten
that
morning
many
of
the
men
were
growing
noisy
some
were
already
drunk
by
noon
shortly
after
midday
dinner
the
first
fight
started
extinguished
only
after
clinch
had
beaten
several
of
the
backwoods
aristocracy
insensible
towering
amid
the
wreck
of
battle
his
light
grey
eyes
clinch
dominated
swinging
his
iron
fists
when
the
combat
ended
and
the
fallen
lay
starkly
where
they
fell
clinch
said
in
his
pleasant
level
voice
take
them
out
and
stick
their
heads
in
the
pond
and
do
go
for
to
get
me
mad
boys
or
i
liable
to
act
up
rough
they
bore
forth
the
sleepers
for
immersion
in
star
pond
clinch
relighted
his
cigar
and
repeated
the
rulings
which
had
caused
the
fracas
you
got
ta
play
square
cards
here
or
you
do
play
none
in
my
house
no
living
can
nick
no
cards
in
my
place
and
get
away
with
it
three
kings
and
two
trays
is
better
than
three
chickens
and
two
eggs
if
you
do
like
it
home
he
went
out
in
his
shirt
sleeves
to
see
how
the
were
reviving
and
met
hal
smith
returning
from
the
pond
who
reported
progress
toward
consciousness
they
walked
back
to
the
hotel
together
say
young
fella
said
clinch
in
his
soft
agreeable
way
you
want
to
keep
your
eye
peeled
why
inquired
smith
well

a
lot
o

strangers
too
do
forget
the
state
troopers

looking
for

asked
smith
smiling
sure
they
been
in
here
rigged
out
like
peddlers
and
and
timber
lookers
did
they
ever
get
anything
on
you
not
a
thing
can
you
always
spot
them
mike
no
but
when
a
stranger
shows
up
here
who
do
know
nobody
he
never
sees
nothing
and
he
do
never
learn
nothing
he
gets
no
hootch
outa
me
no
nor
no
craps
and
no
cards
he
gets
his
supper
that
what
he

and
a
dance
if
there
ladies
and
if
any
girl
favours
him
that
all
the
change
any
stranger
gets
out
of
mike
clinch
they
had
paused
on
the
rough
veranda
in
the
hot
october
sunshine
mike
suggested
smith
carelessly
would
it
pay
you
better
to
go
straight
clinch
small
grey
eyes
which
had
been
roaming
over
the
prospect
of
lake
and
forest
focussed
on
smith
smiling
features
what
that
to
you
he
asked
i
be
out
of
a
job
remarked
smith
laughing
if
they
ever
land
you
clinch
level
gaze
measured
him
his
mind
was
busy
measuring
him
too
who
the
hell
are
you
anyway
he
asked
do
know
you
stick
up
a
man
on
the
ghost
lake
road
and
hide
out
here
when
the
state
troopers
come
after
you
and
now
you
ask
me
if
it
pays
better
to
go
straight
why
did
go
straight
if
you
think
it
pays
i
have
got
a
daughter
to
worry
about
explained
smith
if
they
get
me
it
wo
hurt
anybody
else
a
dull
red
tinge
came
out
under
clinch
tan
who
asked
to
worry
about
eve
she
a
fine
girl
that
all
clinch
steely
glare
measured
the
young
man
you
trying
to
make
up
to
her
he
enquired
gently
no
she
has
no
use
for
me
clinch
reflected
his
cold
still
fastened
on
smith
you
right
he
said
after
a
moment
eve
is
a
good
girl
some
day
i
make
a
lady
of
her
she
one
clinch
at
that
clinch
reddened
heavily
the
first
finer
emotion
ever
betrayed
before
smith
he
did
not
say
anything
for
a
few
moments
but
his
grim
mouth
worked
finally
i
guess
you
was
a
gentleman
once
before
you
went
crooked
hal
he
said
you
act
up
like
you
once
was
say
there
only
one
thing
on
god
earth
i
care
about

guessed
it
too
he
was
off
again
upon
his
ruling
passion
eve
nodded
smith
sure
she
is
my
flesh
and
blood
but
it
seems
like
she
more
even
i
want
she
should
be
a
lady
it
i
want
that
damned
millionaire
harrod
bust
me
but
he
could
stop
me
giving
eve
her
schooling
and
now
all
i
livin
for
is
to
be
fixed
so
to
give
her
money
to
go
to
the
city
like
a
lady
i
do
care
how
i
make
money
all
i
want
is
to
make
it
and
i
to
smith
nodded
again
clinch
now
obsessed
by
his
monomania
went
on
with
an
oath
i
ca
make
no
money
on
the
level
after
what
harrod
done
to
me
and
i
got
ta
fix
up
eve
what
the
hell
do
you

by
asking
me

to
travel
straight
i
dunno
i
was
only
thinking
of
eve
a
lady
is
supposed
to
have
a
crook
for
a
father
clinch
grey
eyes
blazed
for
a
moment
then
their
menacing
glare
dulled
died
out
into
wintry
fixity
i
wa
born
a
crook
he
said
i
ai
got
no
choice
and
worry
young
fella
they
ai
to
get
me
you
ca
go
on
beating
the
game
forever
clinch
i
beating
it
he
hesitated
and
it
wo
be
so
long
neither
before
i
turn
over
enough
to
let
eve
live
in
the
city
like
any
lady
with
her
autymobile
and
her
own
butler
and
all
her
swell
friends
in
a
big
house
like
she
is
educated
for
he
broke
off
abruptly
as
a
procession
approached
from
the
lake
escorting
the
battered
gentry
who
now
were
able
to
wabble
about
a
little
one
of
them
a
trap
thief
named
earl
leverett
slunk
hastily
by
as
though
expecting
another
kick
from
clinch
inside
earl
and
act
up
right
said
clinch
pleasantly
you

have
more
sense
than
to
start
a
fight
in
my
place
you
and
sid
hone
and
harvey
chase
in
and

he
and
smith
followed
the
procession
of
damaged
ones
into
the
house
the
big
unpainted
room
where
a
bar
had
once
been
was
blue
with
cheap
cigar
smoke
the
air
reeked
with
the
stench
of
beer
and
spirits
a
score
or
more
shambling
forest
louts
in
their
dingy
saturday
finery
were
gathered
there
playing
cards
shooting
craps
lolling
around
tables
and
tilting
slopping
glasses
at
one
another
heavy
pleasantries
were
exchanged
with
the
victims
of
clinch
ponderous
fists
as
they
the
room
from
which
they
had
been
borne
so
recently
feet
first
now
boys
said
clinch

and
behave
friendly
and
if
any
ladies
come
in
for
the
chicken
supper
why
gol
dang
it
we
have
a
dance
iii
toward
sundown
the
first
woodland
nymph
appeared
a
willowy
thing
in
the
rosy
light
of
the
clearing
hal
smith
washing
glasses
and
dishes
on
the
back
porch
for
eve
strayer
to
dry
asked
who
the
rustic
beauty
might
be
harvey

any
harm
in
a
chicken
supper
and
a
dance
eve
looked
gravely
at
young
smith
without
replying
other
girlish
shapes
loomed
in
the
evening
light
some
were
met
by
gallants
some
arrived
at
the
veranda
unescorted
where
do
they
all
come
from
do
they
live
in
trees
like
dryads
asked
smith
there
are
always
squatters
in
the
woods
she
replied
indifferently
some
of
these
girls
come
from
ghost
lake
i
suppose
yes
waitresses
at
the
inn
what
music
is
there
jim
hastings

melodeon
if

me
what
do

when
there
a
fight
he
asked
with
a
side
glance
at
her
pure
profile
what
do
you
suppose
i
do
fight
too
he
laughed
mirthlessly
conscious
always
of
his
secret
pity
for
this
girl
well
he
said
when
your
father
makes
enough
to
quit
he
take
you
out
of
this
it
a
vile
hole
for
a
young
girl

she
said
flushing

rather
particular
for
a
young
man
who
stuck
up
a
tourist
and
robbed
him
of
four
thousand
dollars
i
not
complaining
on
my
own
account
returned
smith
laughing
clinch
suits
me
well
do
concern
yourself
on
my
account
hal
smith
and
you
better
keep
out
of
the
dance
too
if
there
are
any
strangers
there
you
think
a
state
trooper
may
happen
in
it
likely

lot
of
people
come
and
go
we
do
always
know
them
she
opened
a
sliding
wooden
shutter
and
looked
into
the
bar
room
after
a
moment
she
beckoned
him
to
her
side
there
are
strangers
there
now
she
said
that
thin
dark
man
who
looks
like
a
kanuk
and
those
two
men
shaking
dice
i
do
know
who
they
are
i
never

had
seen
them
at
ghost
lake
inn
one
of
them
was
sard
quintana
gang
had
arrived
at
clinch
dump
a
moment
later
clinch
came
through
the
pantry
and
kitchen
and
out
onto
the
rear
porch
where
smith
was

of
the
cheering

a
fox
trot
and
eve
melodeon
joined
in
a
vast
scuffling
of
heavily
shod
feet
filled
the
momentary
silence
accented
by
the
shrill
giggle
of
young
girls
they
off
remarked
clinch
to
smith
who
stood
at
the
pantry
shelf
prepared
to

looked
at

very
drunk
none

dinged
business
he
said
very
softly
the
dancing
had
become
boisterous
but
not
unseemly
although
all
the
men
had
been
drinking
too
freely
smith
closed
the
pantry
bar
at
midnight
by
direction
of

came
out
into
the
ballroom
and
mixed
affably
with
the
company
even
dancing
with
harvey
chase
sister
once
a
slender
hoyden
all
flushed
and
dishevelled
with
a
tireless
mania
for

to
intoxicate
her
she
danced

danced
accepting
any
partner
offered
but
skill
enraptured
her
and
she
refused
to
let

slouched
up
to
claim

smith
always
trying
to
keep

and
quintana
men
in

no
part
in
the

them
through
the
door
out
into
the
starlight

starlight

he
came
lurching
forward
swinging
his
heavy
pistol
as
though
he
meant
to
brain
his
victim
but
he
halted
after
the
first
step
or
two
and
stood
there
a
shadowy
bulk
growling
enraged
undecided
and
as
smith
looked
at
him
two
shadows
detached
themselves
from
the
trees
behind
clinch
silently
silently
glided
behind
struck
in
utter
silence
down

his
face
in
the
ooze
his
pistol
flew
from

hand
struck
smith
leg
and
smith
had
it
at
the
same
instant
and
turned
it
like
lightning
on
the
murderous
shadows
hands
up
quick
he
cried
at
bay
now
and
his
back
to
the
pistol
levelled
he
bent
one
knee
pushed
clinch
over
on
his
back
lest
the
ooze
suffocate
him
now
he
said
coolly

the

of

pistol

said
as
the
shadowy
forms

picked

a
stick
and
hurled

at
them

sat
down
hastily
hands
up
backs
toward
him

smith
if

sighed
heavily
stirred
groped
on
the
damp
leaves
with
his
hands
i

began
the
voice
which
smith
identified
as

said
smith
watching
clinch
who
was
reviving
he
sat
up
presently
and
put
both
hands
over
his
head
smith
touched
him
silently
on
the
shoulder
and
he
turned
his
heavy
square
head
in
a
dazed
way
blood
striped
his
visage
he
gazed
dully
at
smith
for
a
little
while
then
seeming
to
recollect
the
old
glare
began
to
light
his
pale
eyes
the
next
instant
however
beck
spoke
again
and
clinch
turned
in
astonishment
and
saw
the
two
figures
sitting
there
with
backs
toward
smith
and
hands
up
clinch
stared
at
the
squatting
forms
then
slowly
moved
his
head
and
looked
at
smith
and
his
levelled
pistol
we
know
how
to
make
a
man
squeal
said
harry
beck
suddenly

to
us
old
pal

he
started
to
look
around
over
his
shoulder
and
smith
hurled
another
stick
and
hit
him
in
the
face
quiet

up
from

was
sitting

one
murderous
glance
at
the
prostrate
forms
then
followed

noiselessly
over
the
stretch
of
sphagnum
moss
when
they
reached

he
took
his
rifle
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
pantry
you
bet
he
muttered
she
a
lady
so
help
me
god
episode
three
on
star
peak
i
mike
clinch
regarded
the
jewels
taken
from
josé
quintana
as
legitimate
loot
acquired
in
war
he
was
prepared
to
kill
anybody
who
attempted
to
take
the
gems
from
him
at
the
very
possibility
his
ruling
passion
blazed
his
mania
to
make
of
eve
strayer
a
grand
lady
but
now
what
he
had
feared
for
years
had
happened
quintana
had
found
him
quintana
after
all
these
years
had
discovered
the
identity
and
dwelling
place
of
the
obscure
american
soldier
who
had
robbed
him
in
the
of
a
paris
café
and
quintana
was
now
in
america
here
in
this
very
wilderness
tracking
the
man
who
had
despoiled
him
clinch
in
his
carrying
a
rifle
came
out
on
the
log
veranda
and
sat
down
to
think
it
over
he
began
to
realise
that
he
was
likely
to
have
trouble
with
a
man
as
and
as
dogged
as
himself
nor
did
he
doubt
that
those
with
quintana
were
desperate
men
on
whom
could
he
count
on
nobody
unless
he
paid
their
hire
none
among
the
lawless
men
who
haunted
his
backwoods
hotel
at
star
pond
would
lift
a
finger
to
help
him
almost
any
among
them
would
have
robbed
him
murdered
him
probably
if
it
were
known
that
jewels
were
hidden
in
the
house
he
could
not
trust
jake
kloon
leverett
was
as
treacherous
as
only
a
born
coward
can
be
sid
hone
harvey
chase
blommers
byron
hastings
he
knew
them
all
too
well
to
trust
them
a
sullen
unscrupulous
pack
partly
cowardly
always
fierce
as
are
any
creatures
that
live
furtively
feed
only
by
their
wits
and
slink
through
life
just
outside
the
frontiers
of
law
and
yet
one
of
this
gang
had
stood
by
him
hal
smith
the
man
he
himself
had
been
about
to
slay
clinch
got
up
from
the
bench
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
walked
down
to
the
pond
where
hal
smith
sat
cleaning
trout
hal
he
said
i
been
figuring
some
quintana
do
dare
call
in
the
constables
i
ca
afford
to
quintana
and
i
got
to
settle
this
on
our
own
smith
slit
open
a
trout
stripped
it
flung
the
entrails
out
into
the
pond
soused
the
fish
in
water
and
threw
it
into
a
milk
pan
whose
jewels
were
they
in
the
beginning
he
enquired
carelessly
how
do
i
know
if
you
ever
found
out
i
do
want
to
i
got
them
in
the
war
anyway
and
it
do
make
no
difference
how
i
got
eve
going
to
be
a
lady
if
i
go
to
the
chair
for
it
so
that
that
smith
slit
another
trout
gutted
it
flung
away
the
viscera
but
laid
back
the
roe
shame
to
take
them
in
october
he
remarked
but
people
must
eat
same
me
nodded
clinch
i
do
want
to
kill
no
one
but
eve
got
ta
be
a
lady
and
ride
in
her
own
automobile
with
the
proudest
does
eve
know
about
the
jewels
clinch
pale
eyes
which
had
been
roving
over
the
wooded
shores
of
star
pond
reverted
to
smith
i
cut
my
throat
before
i
tell
her
he
said
softly
she
would
stand
for
it
hal
when
you
said
to
me
a
lady
by
god
you
swallered
the
hull
pie
that
the
answer

stand
for
what
you
and
i
bother
about
suppose
she
learns
that
you
robbed
the
man
who
robbed
somebody
else
of
these
jewels
clinch
pale
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
only
you
and
me
know
he
said
in
his
pleasant
voice
quintana
knows
his
gang
knows
clinch
smile
was
terrifying
i
guess
she
ai
never
likely
to
know
nothing
hal
what
do
you
purpose
to
do
mike
still
hunt
for
quintana
i
might
mistake
him
for
a
deer
them
accidents
is
likely
too
if
quintana
catches
you
it
will
go
hard
with
you
mike
sure
i
know
he
torture
you
to
make
you
talk
you
think
i
talk
hal
smith
looked
up
into
the
eyes
the
pupils
were
pin
points
then
he
went
on
cleaning
fish
hal
what
if
they
get
me
but
no
matter
they
ai
to
get
me
were
you
going
to
tell
me
where
those
jewels
are
hidden
mike
enquired
the
young
man
still
busy
with
his
fish
he
did
not
look
around
when
he
spoke
clinch
murderous
gaze
was
fastened
on
the
back
of
his
head
do
go
to
gettin
too
damn
nosey
hal
he
said
in
his
always
agreeable
voice
smith
soused
all
the
fish
in
water
again
you
better
tell
somebody
if
you
go
gunning
for
quintana
did
i
ask
your
advice

said
the
young
man
smiling
all
right
mind
your
business
smith
got
up
from
the
water
edge
with
his
pan
of
trout
that
what
i
shall
do
mike
he
said
laughing
so
go
on
with
your
private
war
it
no
button
off
pants
if
quintana
gets
you
he
went
away
toward
the
with
the
trout
eve
strayer
doing
chamber
work
watched
the
young
man
from
an
upper
room
the
girl
instinct
was
to
like
smith
but
that
very
instinct
aroused
her
distrust
what
was
a
man
of
his
breeding
and
education
doing
at
clinch
dump
why
was
he
content
to
hang
around
and
do
chores
a
man
of
his
type
who
has
gone
crooked
enough
to
stick
up
a
tourist
in
an
automobile
nourishes
higher
though
probably
perverted
ambitions
than
a
dollar
a
day
and
board
she
heard
clinch
light
step
on
the
uncarpeted
stair
went
on
making
up
smith
bed
and
smiled
as
her
came
into
the
room
still
carrying
his
rifle
he
had
something
else
in
his
hand
too
a
flat
thin
packet
wrapped
in
heavy
paper
and
sealed
all
over
with
black
wax
girlie
he
said
i
want
you
should
do
a
little
errand
for
me
this
morning
if
you
spry
it

take
long
time

and
lay
this
packet
in
the
hootch
cache
she
nodded
tucked
in
the
sheets
smoothed
blanket
and
pillow
with
deft
hands
went
out
to
her
own
room
clinch
seated
himself
and
turned
a
blank
face
to
the
window
it
was
a
sudden
decision
he
realised
now
that
he
could
keep
the
jewels
in
his
house
war
was
on
with
quintana
the
hotel
would
be
the
goal
for
quintana
and
his
gang
and
for
smith
too
if
ever
temptation
overpowered
him
the
house
was
liable
to
an
attempt
at
robbery
any
night
now
any
day
perhaps
it
was
no
place
for
the
packet
he
had
taken
from
josé
quintana
eve
came
in
wearing
grey
shirt
breeches
and
puttees

gave
her
the
packet
what
in
it

she
asked
smilingly

her

ran
to
her
and
returned
with
her
winchester
and
belt

said
clinch
grimly
if
anyone
wants
to
stop
you
but
lay
low
and
you
wo
need
to
shoot
nobody
girlie
out
the
back
way
hal
in
the
ice
house
ii
slim
and
straight
as
a
young
boy
in
her
grey
shirt
and
breeches
eve
continued
on
lightly
through
the
woods
her
rifle
over
her
shoulder
her
eyes
of
always
alert
the
morning
turned
warm
she
pulled
off
her
soft
felt
hat
shook
out
her
clipped
curls
stripped
open
the
shirt
at
her
snowy
throat
where
sweat
glimmered
like
melted
frost
the
forest
was
lovely
in
the
morning
sunlight
lovely
and
still
save
for
the
for
the
summer
birds
had
gone
and
only
birds
destined
to
a
long
northern
winter
remained
now
and
then
ahead
of
her
she
saw
a
ruffed
grouse
wandering
in
the
trail
these
and
a
single
tiny
grey
bird
with
a
dreary
note
interminably
repeated
were
the
only
living
things
she
saw
except
here
and
there
a
butterfly
of
the
vanessa
tribe
flitting
in
some
stray
sunbeam
the
haunting
odour
of
late
autumn
was
in
the
air
delicately
acrid
the
scent
of
brake
and
ripening
wild
grasses
of
brilliant
dead
leaves
and
black
forest
loam
pungent
with
mast
from
beech
and
oak
eve
tread
was
light
on
the
moist
trail
her
quick
eyes
missed
nothing
not
the
dainty
imprint
of
deer
fresh
made
nor
the
sprawling
insignia
of
rambling
raccoons
nor
the
big
barred
owl
huddled
on
a
pine
limb
overhead
nor
where
the
swift
gravelly
reaches
of
the
brook
caught
sunlight
did
she
miss
the
swirl
and
furrowing
and
milling
of
painted
trout
on
the
spawning
beds
once
she
took
cover
hearing
something
stirring
but
it
was
only
a
yearling
buck
that
came
out
of
the
to
stare
stamp
then
wheel
and
trot
away
displaying
the
danger
signal
in
her
she
carried
the
flat
sealed
packet
which
clinch
had
trusted
to
her
the
sack
swayed
gently
as
she
strode
on
slapping
her
left
hip
at
every
step
and
always
her
subconscious
mind
remained
on
guard
and
aware
of
it
and
now
and
then
she
dropped
her
hand
to
feel
of
the
pouch
and
strap
the
character
of
the
forest
was
now
changing
as
she
advanced
the
first
tamaracks
appeared
slim
silvery
trunks
crowned
with
the
gold
of
autumn
foliage
outer
sentinels
of
that
vast
maze
of
swamp
and
stream
called
owl
marsh
the
stronghold
and
refuge
of
forest
wild
things
sometimes
the
sanctuary
of
hunted
men
from
star
peak
left
flank
an
icy
stream
clatters
down
to
the
level
floor
of
the
woods
here
and
it
was
here
that
eve
had
meant
to
quench
her
thirst
with
a
mouthful
of
sweet
water
but
as
she
approached
the
tiny
ford
warily
she
saw
a
saddled
horse
tied
to
a
sapling
and
a
man
seated
on
a
mossy
log
the
trappings
of
horse
the
uniform
of
the
man
left
no
room
for
speculation
a
trooper
of
the
state
constabulary
was
seated
there
his
cap
was
off
his
head
rested
on
his
palm
elbow
on
knee
he
sat
there
gazing
at
the
water
watching
the
slim
fish
perhaps
darting
up
stream
toward
their
hidden
far
away
at
the
headwaters
a
detour
was
imperative
the
girl
from
the
shelter
of
a
pine
looked
out
cautiously
at
the
trooper
the
sudden
sight
of
him
had
merely
checked
her
now
the
recognition
of
his
uniform
startled
her
heart
out
of
its
tranquil
rhythm
and
set
the
blood
burning
in
her
cheeks
there
was
a
memory
of
such
a
man
seared
into
the
girl
very
soul
a
man
whose
head
and
shoulders
resembled
this
man
who
had
the
same
bright
hair
the
same
slim
and
powerful
body
and
who
moved
too
as
this
young
man
moved
the
trooper
stirred
lifted
his
head
to
relight
his
pipe
the
girl
knew
him
her
heart
stood
still
then
heart
and
blood
ran
riot
and
she
felt
her
knees
tremble
felt
weak
as
she
rested
against
the
pine
huge
trunk
and
covered
her
face
with
unsteady
fingers
until
the
moment
eve
had
never
dreamed
what
the
memory
of
this
man
really
meant
to
her
never
dreamed
that
she
had
capacity
for
emotion
so
utterly
overwhelming
even
now
confusion
shame
fear
were
paramount
all
she
wanted
was
to
get
away
get
away
and
still
her
heart
wild
beating
control
the
strange
tremor
that
possessed
her
recover
mind
and
sense
and
breath
she
drew
her
hand
from
her
eyes
and
looked
upon
the
man
she
had
attempted
to
kill
upon
the
young
man
who
had
wrestled
her
off
her
feet
and
handcuffed
her
and
who
had
bathed
her
bleeding
mouth
with
sphagnum
and
who
had
kissed
her
hands
she
was
trembling
so
that
she
became
frightened
the
racket
of
the
brook
in
his
ears
safeguarded
her
in
a
measure
she
bent
over
nearly
double
her
rifle
at
a
trail
and
cautiously
began
the
detour
when
at
length
the
wide
circle
through
the
woods
had
been
safely
accomplished
and
eve
was
moving
out
through
the
thickening
ranks
of
tamarack
her
heart
which
seemed
to
suffocate
her
quieted
and
she
leaned
against
a
shoulder
of
rock
strangely
tired
after
a
while
she
drew
from
her
pocket
handkerchief
and
looked
at
it
the
square
of
cambric
bore
his
initials
blood
from
her
lip
remained
on
it
she
had
not
washed
out
the
spots
she
put
it
to
her
lips
again
mechanically
a
faint
odour
of
tobacco
still
clung
to
it
by
every
law
of
loyalty
pride
she
should
have
held
this
man
her
enemy
instead
she
held
his
handkerchief
against
her
lips
crushed
it
there
suddenly
closing
her
eyes
while
the
colour
surged
and
surged
through
her
skin
from
throat
to
hair
then
wearily
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
out
into
the
grey
and
empty
vista
of
her
life
where
the
dreary
years
seemed
to
stretch
like
milestones
away
away
into
an
endless
waste
she
put
the
handkerchief
into
her
pocket
shouldered
her
rifle
moved
on
without
looking
about
her
a
mistake
which
only
the
emotion
of
the
moment
could
account
for
in
a
girl
so
habituated
to
caution
for
she
had
gone
only
a
few
rods
before
a
man
strident
voice
halted
her
là
crosse
en
air
drop
that
rifle
came
another
voice
from
behind
her
you
covered
throw
your
gun
on
the
ground
she
stood
as
though
paralysed
to
the
right
and
left
she
heard
people
trampling
through
the
thicket
toward
her
down
with
that
gun
damn
you
repeated
the
voice
breathless
from
running
all
around
her
men
came
floundering
and
crashing
toward
her
through
the
undergrowth
she
could
see
some
of
them
as
she
stooped
to
place
her
rifle
on
the
dead
leaves
she
drew
the
flat
packet
from
her
cartridge
sack
at
the
same
time
and
slid
it
deftly
under
a
rotting
log
then
calm
but
very
pale
she
stood
upright
to
face
events
the
first
man
wore
a
red
and
yellow
bandanna
handkerchief
over
the
lower
half
of
his
face
pulled
tightly
across
a
bony
nose
he
held
a
long
pistol
nearly
parallel
to
his
own
body
and
when
he
came
up
to
where
she
was
standing
he
poked
the
muzzle
into
her
stomach
she
did
not
flinch
he
said
nothing
she
looked
intently
into
the
two
ratty
eyes
fastened
on
her
over
the
edge
of
his
bandanna
five
other
men
were
surrounding
her
but
they
all
wore
white
masks
of
vizard
shape
revealing
chin
and
mouth
they
were
different
otherwise
also
wearing
various
sorts
and
patterns
of
sport
clothes
brand
new
and
giving
them
an
odd
foreign
appearance
what
troubled
her
most
was
the
silence
they
maintained
the
man
wearing
the
bandanna
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
at
all
a
familiar
figure
merely
perhaps
because
he
was
american
in
build
clothing
and
movement
he
took
her
by
the
shoulder
turned
her
around
and
gave
her
a
shove
forward
she
staggered
a
step
or
two
he
gave
her
another
shove
and
she
comprehended
that
she
was
to
keep
on
going
presently
she
found
herself
in
a
steep
wet
rising
upward
through
a
gully
she
knew
that
runway
it
led
up
star
peak
behind
her
as
she
climbed
she
heard
the
slopping
panting
tread
of
men
her
wind
was
better
than
theirs
she
climbed
lithely
upward
setting
a
pace
which
finally
resulted
in
a
violent
jerk
backward
a
savage
wordless
admonition
to
go
more
slowly
as
she
climbed
she
wondered
whether
she
should
have
fired
an
alarm
shot
on
the
chance
of
the
state
trooper
stormont
hearing
it
but
she
had
thought
only
of
the
packet
at
the
moment
of
surprise
and
now
she
wondered
whether
when
freed
she
could
ever
again
find
that
rotting
log
up
up
always
up
along
the
wet
gully
deep
with
silt
and
rock
she
toiled
the
heavy
gasping
of
men
behind
her
twice
she
was
jerked
to
a
halt
while
her
escort
rested
once
without
turning
she
said
unsteadily
who
are
you
what
have
i
done
to
you
there
was
no
reply
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
she
began
again
and
was
shaken
by
the
shoulder
until
silent
at
last
the
vast
arch
of
the
eastern
sky
sprang
out
ahead
where
stunted
spruces
stood
out
against
the
sunshine
and
the
intense
heat
of
midday
fell
upon
a
bare
of
rock
and
moss
and
fern
as
she
came
out
upon
the
level
the
man
behind
her
took
both
her
arms
and
pulled
them
back
and
somebody
bandaged
her
eyes
then
a
hand
closed
on
her
left
arm
and
so
guided
she
stumbled
and
crept
forward
across
the
rocks
for
a
few
moments
until
her
guide
halted
her
and
forced
her
into
a
sitting
position
on
a
smooth
flat
boulder
she
heard
the
crunching
of
heavy
feet
all
around
her
whispering
made
hoarse
by
breath
exhausted
movement
across
rock
and
scrub
retreating
steps
for
an
interminable
time
she
sat
there
alone
in
the
hot
sun
drenched
to
the
skin
in
sweat
listening
thinking
striving
to
find
a
reason
for
this
lawless
outrage
after
a
long
while
she
heard
somebody
coming
across
the
rocks
stiffened
as
she
listened
with
some
vague
presentiment
of
evil
somebody
had
halted
beside
her
after
a
pause
she
was
aware
of
nimble
fingers
busy
with
the
bandage
over
her
eyes
at
first
when
freed
the
light
blinded
her
by
degrees
she
was
able
to
distinguish
the
rocky
crest
of
star
peak
with
the
tops
of
tall
trees
appearing
level
with
the
rocks
from
depths
below
then
she
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
the
man
who
had
seated
himself
beside
her
he
wore
a
white
mask
over
a
delicate
smoothly
shaven
face
his
soft
hat
and
sporting
clothes
were
dark
grey
evidently
new
and
she
noticed
his
hands
long
elegantly
made
smooth
restless
playing
with
a
pencil
and
some
sheets
of
paper
on
his
knees
as
she
met
his
brilliant
eyes
behind
the
mask
his
delicate
thin
lips
grew
tense
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
smile
or
a
soundless
sort
of
laugh
veree
happee
he
said
to
make
the
acquaintance
pardon
my
unceremony
miss
but
onlee
necissitee
compels
are
you
perhaps
a
little
rested
yes
ah
then
if
you
permit
we
proceed
with
affairs
of
moment
you
will
be
sufficiently
kind
to
write
down
what
i
say
yes
he
placed
paper
and
pencil
in
eve
hand
without
demurring
or
hesitation
she
made
ready
to
write
her
mind
groping
wildly
for
the
reason
of
it
all
write
he
said
with
his
silent
laugh
which
was
more
like
the
soundless
snarl
of
a
lynx
unafraid
to
mike
clinch
my
fathaire
from
his
child
eve
i
am
hostage
held
by
josé
quintana
pay
what
you
owe
him
and
i
go
free
for
each
day
delay
he
sends
to
you
one
finger
which
will
be
severed
from
my
right
hand
eve
slender
fingers
trembled
she
looked
up
at
the
masked
man
stared
steadily
into
his
brilliant
eyes
proceed
miss
if
you
are
so
amiable
he
said
softly
she
wrote
on
one
finger
for
every
day
delay
the
whole
hand
at
the
week
end
the
other
hand
then
finger
by
finger
then
alas
the
right
foot
eve
trembled
proceed
he
said
softly
she
wrote
if
you
agree
you
shall
pay
what
you
owe
to
josé
quintana
in
this
manner
you
shall
place
a
stick
at
the
edge
of
the
star
pond
where
the
star
rivulet
flows
out
upon
this
stick
you
shall
tie
a
white
rag
at
the
foot
of
the
stick
you
shall
lay
the
parcel
which
contains
your
indebt
to
josé
quintana
failing
this
by
at
sunset
the
man
paused
eve
waited
dumb
under
the
surging
confusion
in
her
brain
a
sort
of
incredulous
horror
benumbed
her
through
which
she
still
heard
and
perceived
be
kind
enough
to
sign
it
with
your
name
said
the
man
pleasantly
eve
signed
then
the
masked
man
took
the
letter
got
up
removed
his
hat
i
am
quintana
he
said
i
keep
my
word
a
thousand
thanks
and
apologies
miss
i
trust
that
your
detention
may
be
brief
and
not
too
disagreeable
i
place
at
your
feet
my
humble
respects
he
bowed
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
quickly
away
and
she
saw
him
descend
the
rocks
to
the
eastward
where
the
peak
slopes
when
quintana
had
disappeared
behind
the
summit
scrub
and
rocks
eve
slowly
stood
up
and
looked
about
her
at
the
rocky
pulpit
so
familiar
there
was
only
one
way
out
quintana
had
gone
that
way
his
men
no
doubt
guarded
it
otherwise
sheer
precipices
confronted
her
she
walked
to
the
western
edge
where
a
sheet
of
slippery
reindeer
moss
clothed
the
rock
below
the
mountain
fell
away
to
the
valley
where
she
had
been
made
prisoner
she
looked
out
over
the
vast
panorama
of
wilderness
and
mountain
range
on
range
stretching
blue
to
the
horizon
she
looked
down
into
the
depths
of
the
valley
where
deep
under
the
flaming
foliage
of
october
somewhere
a
state
trooper
was
sitting
cheek
on
hand
beside
a
waterfall
or
perhaps
riding
slowly
through
a
forest
which
she
might
never
gaze
upon
again
there
was
a
noise
on
the
rocks
behind
her
a
masked
man
came
out
of
the
spruce
scrub
laid
a
blanket
on
the
rocks
placed
a
loaf
of
bread
some
cheese
and
a
tin
pail
full
of
water
upon
it
motioned
her
and
went
away
through
the
dwarf
spruces
eve
walked
slowly
to
the
blanket
she
drank
out
of
the
tin
pail
then
she
set
aside
the
food
lay
down
and
buried
her
quivering
face
in
her
arms
the
sun
was
half
way
between
zenith
and
horizon
when
she
heard
somebody
coming
and
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
her
visitor
was
quintana
he
came
up
to
her
quite
close
stood
with
glittering
eyes
intent
upon
her
after
a
moment
he
handed
her
a
letter
she
could
scarcely
unfold
it
she
trembled
so
girlie
for
god
sake
give
that
packet
to
quintana
and
come
on
home
i
near
crazy
with
it
all
what

hell

girlie
i
do
give
a
damn
for
nothing
only
you
so
come
on
quick
dad
after
a
little
while
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
quintana
so
he
said
quietly
you
are
the
little
that
has
learned
tricks
already
what
do
you
mean
where
is
that
packet
i
have
it
where
is
it
she
shook
her
head
slightly
you
had
a
packet
he
insisted
fiercely
look
here
regard
and
he
spread
out
a
penciled
sheet
in
clinch
hand
josé
quintana
you
win
she
got
that
stuff
with
her
take
your
damn
junk
and
let
my
girl
go
mike
clinch
well
said
quintana
a
thin
strident
edge
to
his
tone
my
father
is
mistaken
i
have
any
packet
the
man
visage
behind
his
mask
flushed
darkly
without
warning
or
ceremony
he
caught
eve
by
the
throat
and
tore
open
her
shirt
then
hissing
and
cursing
and
panting
with
his
own
violence
he
searched
her
brutally
and
without
mercy
flung
her
down
and
tore
off
her
spiral
puttees
and
even
her
shoes
and
stockings
now
apparently
beside
himself
with
fury
puffing
gasping
always
with
a
fierce
nasal
sort
of
whining
undertone
like
an
animal
worrying
its
kill
cowardly
beast
she
panted
fighting
him
with
all
her
strength
filthy
cowardly
beast
striking
at
him
wrenching
his
grasp
away
snatching
at
the
disordered
clothing
half
stripped
from
her
his
hunting
knife
fell
clattering
and
she
fought
to
get
it
but
he
struck
her
with
his
open
hand
knocking
her
down
at
his
feet
and
stood
glaring
at
her
with
every
tooth
bared
so
he
cried
i
give
you
ten
minutes
make
up
your
mind
tell
me
what
you
do
with
that
packet
he
wiped
the
blood
from
his
face
where
she
had
struck
him
you
do
know
josé
quintana
no
you
shall
make
his
acquaintance
yes
eve
got
up
on
naked
feet
quivering
from
head
to
foot
striving
to
button
the
grey
shirt
at
her
throat
where
he
demanded
beside
himself
her
mute
lips
only
tightened
ver
well
by
god
he
cried
i
go
make
me
some
fire
you
like
it
eh
we
shall
put
one
toe
in
the
fire
until
it
burn
off
yes
eh
how
you
like
it
eh
the
girl
trembling
hands
continued
busy
with
her
clothing
so
he
said
hoarsely
you
remain
dumb
well
then
in
ten
minutes
you
shall
talk
he
walked
toward
her
pushed
her
savagely
aside
and
strode
on
into
the
spruce
thicket
the
instant
he
disappeared
eve
caught
up
the
knife
he
had
dropped
knelt
down
on
the
blanket
and
fell
to
cutting
it
into
strips
the
hunting
knife
was
like
a
razor
the
feverish
business
was
accomplished
in
a
few
moments
the
pieces
knotted
the
cord
strained
in
a
desperate
test
over
her
knee
and
now
she
ran
to
the
precipice
where
ten
feet
below
the
top
of
a
great
pine
protruded
from
the
gulf
on
the
edge
of
the
abyss
was
a
spruce
root
it
looked
dead
wedged
deep
between
two
rocks
but
with
all
her
strength
she
could
not
pull
it
out
sobbing
breathless
she
tied
her
blanket
rope
to
this
threw
the
other
end
over
the
cliff
edge
and
not
giving
herself
time
to
think
lay
flat
grasped
the
knotted
line
swung
off
knot
by
knot
she
went
down
her
naked
feet
brushed
the
needles
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
behind
and
down
then
teeth
clenched
she
lowered
herself
steadily
as
she
had
learned
to
do
in
the
school
gymnasium
down
down
until
her
legs
came
astride
of
a
pine
limb
it
bent
swayed
gave
with
her
letting
her
sag
to
a
larger
limb
below
this
she
clasped
letting
go
her
rope
already
from
the
mountain
rocky
crest
above
she
heard
excited
cries
once
on
her
breakneck
descent
she
looked
up
through
the
foliage
of
the
pine
and
she
saw
far
up
against
the
sky
a
face
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
but
if
it
were
quintana
or
another
of
his
people
she
could
not
tell
and
again
looking
down
she
began
again
the
terrible
descent
an
hour
later
trooper
stormont
of
the
state
constabulary
sat
his
horse
in
amazement
to
see
a
ragged
breathless
boyish
figure
speeding
toward
him
among
the
tamaracks
her
naked
feet
splashing
through
pool
and
mire
and
sphagnum
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
as
she
flung
herself
against
his
stirrup
sobbing
hysterical
and
clinging
to
his
knee
take
me
back
she
stammered
take
me
back
to
daddy
i
ca
go
on
another
step
he
leaned
down
swung
her
up
to
his
saddle
in
front
holding
her
cradled
in
his
arms
lie
still
he
said
coolly
you
all
right
now
for
another
second
he
sat
looking
down
at
her
at
the
dishevelled
hair
the
gasping
mouth
at
the
rags
clothing
her
and
at
the
flat
packet
clasped
convulsively
to
her
breast
then
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
his
horse
guiding

with
one
knee

when

out
of
the
motley
crowd
around
the
tavern

his
rifle
against
a
tree
and
stretched
forth
his
powerful
hands
to
receive
his
stepchild
he
held
her
cradled
looking
down
at
her
in
silence
as
the
men
clustered
around
eve
he
said
hoarsely

the
girl
opened
her
eyes
i

almost
sobbed

he
carried
her
to
the
veranda
the
packet

from
her
cramped
fingers

it
under
a
chair
and
continued
on
into
the

and
up
the
stairs

cut
up
the
blanket
they
gave
me
and
made
a
rope
then
i
went
over
the

into
the
big

handed

with
a
loop
of
ammunition
come
on
he
grunted
on
the
veranda
he
strode
up
to
the
group
of
sullen
armed
men
who
regarded
his
advent
in
expressionless
silence
sid

counted

cold

a
heavy
hand
on

the
young

up

such
good
care

replied
smith
that
its
proper
owner

not
worry
ii
the
proper
owner
of
the
packet
was
at
that
moment
on
the
atlantic
ocean
travelling
toward
the
united
states
four
other
pretended
owners
of
the
grand
duchess
theodorica
jewels
totally
unconscious
of
anything
impending
which
might
impair
their
several
titles

gathered
together
in
a
wilderness
within
a
few
miles
of
one
another
josé

lay
somewhere
in
the
forests
with
his
gang
fiercely
planning
the
recovery
of
the
treasure
of
which
clinch
had
once
robbed
him
clinch
squatted
on
his
runway
watching
the
mountain
flank
with
murderous
eyes
it
was
no
longer
the
flaming
jewel
which
mattered
his
master
passion
ruled
him
now
those
who
had
offered
violence
to
eve
must
be
reckoned
with
first
of
all
the
hand
that
struck
eve
strayer
had
offered
mortal
insult
to
mike
clinch
as
for
the
third
pretender
to
the
flaming
jewel
jake
kloon
he
was
now
travelling
in
a
fox
circle
toward
drowned
valley
that
shaggy
wilderness
of
slime
and
tamarack
and
depthless
bog
which
touches
the
northwest
base
of
star
peak
he
was
not
hurrying
having
no
thought
of
pursuit
behind
him
plodded
leverett
the
trap
thief
very
very
busy
with
his
own
ideas
to
leverett
repeated
requests
that
kloon
halt
and
open
the
packet
to
see
what
it
contained
kloon
gruffly
refused
what
do
we
care
what
in
it
he
said
we
get
ten
thousand
apiece
over
our
rifles
for
it
from
them
guys
ai
it
a
good
enough
job
for
you

argued
leverett
let
take
a
peek
anyway
naw
i
do
want
no

the
ten
thousand
comes
too
easy
more

going

woods
where
mike
clinch
dens
they
plodded
on
arguing
toward
their
rendezvous
with
outpost
on
the
edge
of
drowned
valley
the
fourth
pretender
to
the
pearls
rubies
and
great
gem
called
the
flaming
jewel
stolen
from
the
young
grand
duchess
theodorica
of
esthonia
by
josé
quintana
was
an
unconscious
pretender
entirely
innocent
of
the
rôle
assigned
her
by
clinch
for
eve
strayer
had
never
heard
where
the
packet
came
from
or
what
it
contained
all
she
knew
was
that
her
stepfather
had
told
her
that
it
belonged
to
her
and
the
knowledge
left
her
incurious
iii
eve
slept
the
sleep
of
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
reaction
from
fear
brings
a
fatigue
more
profound
than
that
which
follows
physical
overstrain
but
the
healthy
mind
like
the
healthy
body
disposes
very
thoroughly
of
toxics
which
arise
from
terror
and
exhaustion
the
girl
slept
profoundly
calmly
her
bruised
young
mind
and
body
left
her
undisturbed
there
was
neither
restlessness
nor
fever
sleep
swept
her
with
its
clean
sweet
tide
cleansing
the
superb
youth
and
health
of
her
with
the
most
wonderful
balm
in
the
divine
pharmacy
she
awoke
late
in
the
afternoon
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
state
trooper
stormont
sitting
by
the
window
and
gazing
out
perhaps
eve
confused
senses
mistook
the
young
man
for
a
vision
for
she
lay
very
still
nor
stirred
even
her
little
finger
after
a
while
stormont
glanced
around
at
her
a
warm
delicate
colour
stained
her
skin
slowly
evenly
from
throat
to
hair
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
the
bed
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
awkwardly
where
is
dad
she
managed
to
inquire
in
a
steady
voice
he
wo
be
back
till
late
he
asked
me
to
stick
around
in
case
you
needed
anything
the
girl
clear
eyes
searched
his
trooper
stormont
yes
eve
dad
gone
after
quintana
is
he
the
fellow
who
misused
you
i
think
so
who
is
he
i
do
know
is
he
your
enemy
or
your
stepfather
but
the
girl
shook
her
head
i
ca
discuss
dad
affairs
with
with
with
a
state
trooper
smiled
stormont
that
all
right
eve
you
do
have
to
there
was
a
pause
stormont
stood
beside
the
bed
looking
down
at
her
with
his
diffident
boyish
smile
and
the
girl
gazed
back
straight
into
his
eyes
eyes
she
had
so
often
looked
into
in
her
dreams
i
to
cook
you
an
egg
and
bring
you
some
pie
he
remarked
still
smiling
did
dad
say
i
am
to
stay
in
bed
that
was
my
inference
do
you
feel
very
lame
and
sore
my
feet
burn
you
poor
kid
would
you
let
me
look
at
them
i
have
a
packet
with
me
after
a
moment
she
nodded
and
turned
her
face
on
the
pillow
he
drew
aside
the
cover
a
little
knelt
down
beside
the
bed
then
he
rose
and
went
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
there
was
hot
water
in
the
kettle
he
fetched
it
back
bathed
her
feet
drew
out
from
cut
and
scratch
the
flakes
of
and
that
still
remained
there
from
his
packet
he
took
a
capsule
dissolved
it
sterilized
the
torn
skin
then
bandaged
both
feet
with
a
deliciously
cool
salve
and
drew
the
sheets
into
place
eve
had
not
stirred
nor
spoken
he
washed
and
dried
his
hands
and
came
back
drawing
his
chair
nearer
to
the
bedside
sleep
if
you
feel
like
it
he
said
pleasantly
as
she
made
no
sound
or
movement
he
bent
over
to
see
if
she
had
already
fallen
asleep
and
noticed
that
her
flushed
cheeks
were
wet
with
tears
are
you
suffering
he
asked
gently
no
you
are
so
wonderfully
kind
why
should
i
be
kind
he
said
amused
and
touched
by
the
emotion
i
tried
to
shoot
you
once
that
is
why
you
ought
to
hate
me
he
began
to
laugh
is
what
you
thinking
about
i
never
can
forget
nonsense
we
quits
anyway
do
you
remember
what
i
did
to
he
was
thinking
of
the
handcuffs
then
in
her
vivid
blush
he
read
what
she
was
thinking
and
he
remembered
his
lips
on
her
palms
he
too
now
was
blushing
brilliantly
at
memory
of
that
swift
sudden
rush
of
romantic
tenderness
which
this
girl
had
witnessed
that
memorable
day
on
owl
marsh
in
the
hot
uncomfortable
silence
neither
spoke
he
seated
himself
after
a
while
and
after
a
while
she
turned
on
her
pillow
part
way
toward
him
somehow
they
both
understood
that
it
was
friendship
which
had
subtly
filled
the
interval
that
separated
them
since
that
amazing
day
i
often
thought
of
you
he
said
as
though
they
had
been
discussing
his
absence
no
hour
of
the
waking
day
that
she
had
not
thought
of
him
but
she
did
not
say
so
now
after
a
little
while
is
yours
a
lonely
life
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
sometimes
but
i
love
the
forest
sometimes
she
said
the
forest
seems
like
a
trap
that
i
escape
sometimes
i
hate
it
are
you
lonely
eve
as
you
are
you
see
i
know
what
the
outside
world
is
i
miss
it
you
were
in
boarding
school
and
college
yes
it
must
be
hard
for
you
here
at
star
pond
the
girl
sighed
unconsciously
there
are
days
when
i
can
scarcely
stand
it
the
wilderness
would
be
more
endurable
if
dad
and
i
were
all
alone
but
even
then
you
need
young
people
of
your
own
age
educated
companions
i
need
the
city
stormont
i
need
all
it
can
give
i
starving
for
it
that
all
she
turned
on
her
pillow
and
he
saw
that
she
was
smiling
faintly
her
face
bore
no
trace
of
the
tragic
truth
she
had
uttered
but
the
tragedy
was
plain
enough
to
him
even
without
her
passionless
words
of
revolt
the
situation
of
this
young
educated
girl
aglow
with
youth
fettered
body
and
mind
to
the
squalor
of
clinch
dump
was
perfectly
plain
to
anybody
she
said
seeing
his
troubled
expression
i
sorry
i
spoke
that
way
i
knew
how
you
must
feel
anyway
it
seems
ungrateful
she
murmured
i
love
my
you
proven
that
he
remarked
with
a
dry
humour
that
brought
the
hot
flush
to
her
face
again
i
must
have
been
crazy
that
day
she
said
it
scares
me
to
remember
what
i
tried
to
do
what
a
frightful
thing
if
i
had
killed
you
how
you
forgive
me
how
can
you
forgive
eve
she
turned
her
head
i
do
entirely
yes
he
said
a
slight
emotion
noticeable
in
his
voice
well
i
forgave
you
before
the
darned
gun
exploded
in
our
hands
how
you
she
protested
i
was
thinking
all
the
while
that
you
were
acting
as
i
have
acted
if
anything
threatened
father
were
you
thinking
of
yes
and
also
how
to
get
hold
of
you
before
you
shot
me
he
began
to
laugh
after
a
moment
she
turned
her
head
to
look
at
him
and
her
smile
glimmered
responsive
to
his
amusement
but
she
shivered
slightly
too
how
about
that
egg
he
inquired
i
can
get
up
better
keep
off
your
feet
what
is
there
in
the
pantry
you
must
be
starved
i
could
eat
a
little
before
supper
time
she
admitted
i
forgot
to
take
my
lunch
with
me
this
morning
it
is
still
there
in
the
pantry
on
the
bread
box
wrapped
up
in
brown
paper
just
as
i
left
it
she
half
rose
in
bed
supported
on
one
arm
her
curly
hair
framing
her
face
two
cakes
of
chocolate
in
a
flat
brown
packet
tied
with
a
string
she
explained
smiling
at
his
amusement
so
he
went
down
to
the
pantry
and
discovered
the
parcel
on
the
bread
box
where
she
had
left
it
that
morning
before
starting
for
the
cache
on
owl
marsh
he
brought
it
to
her
placed
both
pillows
upright
behind
her
stepped
back
gaily
to
admire
the
effect
eve
with
her
parcel
in
her
hands
laughed
shyly
at
his
comedy
begin
on
your
chocolate
he
said
i
going
back
to
fix
you
some
bread
and
butter
and
a
cup
of
tea
when
again
he
had
disappeared
the
girl
still
smiling
began
to
untie
her
packet
unhurriedly
slowly
loosening
string
and
wrapping
her
attention
was
not
fixed
on
what
her
slender
fingers
were
about
she
drew
from
the
parcel
a
flat
morocco
case
with
a
coat
of
arms
and
crest
stamped
on
it
in
gold
black
and
scarlet
for
a
few
moments
she
stared
at
the
object
stupidly
the
next
moment
she
heard
stormont
spurred
tread
on
the
stairs
and
she
thrust
the
morocco
case
and
the
wrapping
under
the
pillows
behind
her
she
looked
up
at
him
in
a
dazed
way
when
he
came
in
with
the
tea
and
bread
he
set
the
tin
tray
on
her
bureau
and
came
over
to
the
bedside
eve
he
said
you
look
very
white
and
have
you
been
hurt
somewhere
and
have
you
admitted
it
she
seemed
unable
to
speak
and
he
took
both
her
hands
and
looked
anxiously
into
the
lovely
pallid
features
after
a
moment
she
turned
her
head
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
trembling
now
in
overwhelming
realization
of
what
she
had
endured
for
the
sake
of
two
cakes
of
chocolate
hidden
under
a
bush
in
the
forest
for
a
long
while
the
girl
lay
there
the
feverish
flush
of
tears
on
her
partly
hidden
face
her
nervous
hands
tremulous
restless
now
seeking
his
convulsively
now
striving
to
escape
his
clasp
eloquent
uncertain
little
hands
that
seemed
to
tell
so
much
and
yet
were
telling
him
nothing
he
could
understand
eve
dear
he
said
are
you
in
pain
what
is
it
that
has
happened
to
you
i
thought
you
were
all
right
you
seemed
all
right
i
am
she
said
in
a
smothered
voice
you
stay
here
with
me
you
of
course
i
will
it
just
the
reaction
it
all
over
relaxing
that
all
dear
you
safe
nothing
can
harm
you
now
please
do
leave
me
after
a
moment
i
wo
leave
you
i
wish
i
might
never
leave
you
in
the
tense
silence
that
followed
her
trembling
ceased
then
his
heart
heavy
irregular
began
beating
so
that
the
startled
pulses
in
her
body
awoke
wildly
responsive
deep
emotions
new
unfamiliar
were
stirring
awaking
confusing
them
both
in
a
sudden
instinct
to
escape
she
turned
and
partly
rose
on
one
elbow
gazing
blindly
about
her
out
of
eyes
i
want
my
room
to
myself
she
murmured
in
a
breathless
sort
of
way
i
want
you
to
go
out
please
a
boyish
flush
burnt
his
face
he
got
up
slowly
took
his
rifle
from
the
corner
went
out
closing
the
door
and
seated
himself
on
the
stairs
and
there
on
guard
sat
trooper
stormont
rigid
unstirring
hour
after
hour
facing
the
first
great
passion
of
his
life
and
stunned
by
the
impact
of
its
swift
and
unexpected
blow
in
her
chamber
on
the
bed
edge
sat
eve
strayer
her
deep
eyes
fixed
on
space
vague
emotions
exquisitely
recurrent
new
born
possessed
her
the
whole
world
too
all
around
her
seemed
to
have
become
misty
and
golden
and
all
pulsating
with
a
faint
still
rhythm
that
indefinably
thrilled
her
pulses
to
response
passion
springs
flaming
from
the
heart
of
man
woman
is
slow
to
burn
and
it
was
the
delicate
phantom
of
passion
that
eve
gazed
upon
there
in
her
unpainted
chamber
her
fingers
linked
listlessly
in
her
lap
her
little
feet
like
bruised
white
flowers
drooping
above
the
floor
hour
after
hour
she
sat
there
dreaming
staring
at
the
tinted
ghost
of
eros
unreal
impalpable
as
the
dusty
sunbeam
that
slanted
from
her
window
gilding
the
boarded
floor
three
spectres
gliding
near
paused
to
gaze
at
state
trooper
stormont
on
guard
by
the
stairs
then
they
looked
at
the
closed
door
of
chamber
then
the
three
spectres
fate
chance
and
destiny
whispering
together
passed
on
toward
the
depths
of
the
sunset
forest
episode
five
drowned
valley
i
the
soft
bluish
forest
shadows
had
lengthened
and
the
barred
filtering
through
were
tinged
with
a
rosy
hue
before
jake
kloon
the
hootch
runner
and
earl
leverett
trap
thief
came
to
drowned
valley
they
were
still
a
mile
distant
from
the
most
southern
edge
of
that
vast
desolation
but
already
tamaracks
appeared
in
the
beauty
of
their
burnt
gold
little
pools
glimmered
here
and
there
patches
of
amber
sphagnum
and
crimson
became
frequent
and
once
or
twice
big
boots
broke
through
the
crust
of
fallen
leaves
soaking
him
to
the
ankles
with
black
silt
leverett
always
a
coward
had
pursued
his
devious
and
larcenous
way
through
the
world
always
in
deadly
fear
of
sink
holes
his
movements
and
paths
were
those
of
a
weasel
preferring
always
solid
ground
but
he
lacked
the
courage
of
that
sinuous
little
beast
though
he
possessed
all
of
its
ferocity
and
far
more
cunning
now
trotting
lightly
and
tirelessly
in
the
broad
and
careless
spoor
of
jake
kloon
his
narrow
pointed
head
alert
and
every
instinct
tensely
observant
the
continued
to
meditate
murder
like
all
cowards
he
had
always
been
inclined
to
bold
and
ruthless
action
but
inclination
was
all
that
ever
had
happened
yet
even
in
his
pitiable
misdemeanours
he
slunk
through
life
in
terror
of
that
strength
which
never
hesitates
at
violence
in
his
petty
pilfering
he
died
a
hundred
deaths
for
every
trapped
mink
or
otter
he
filched
he
heard
the
game
protector
tread
as
he
slunk
from
the
bagged
trout
brook
or
crawled
away
belly
dragging
and
pockets
full
of
snared
grouse
always
he
had
dreamed
of
the
day
when
through
some
sudden
bold
and
savage
stroke
he
could
deliver
himself
from
a
life
of
fear
and
live
in
a
city
grossly
replete
with
the
pleasures
of
satiation
never
again
to
see
a
tree
or
a
lonely
lake
or
the
blue
peaks
which
always
he
had
hated
because
they
seemed
to
spy
on
him
from
their
heights
they
were
spying
on
him
now
as
he
moved
lightly
furtively
at
jake
kloon
heels
meditating
once
more
that
swift
bold
stroke
which
forever
would
free
him
from
all
care
and
fear
he
looked
at
the
back
of
kloon
massive
head
one
shot
would
blow
that
skull
into
fragments
he
thought
shivering
one
shot
from
behind
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
or
if
it
proved
a
better
deal
the
contents
of
the
packet
for
if
quintana
bribery
had
dazzled
them
what
effect
might
the
contents
of
that
secret
packet
have
if
revealed
always
in
his
mean
and
busy
brain
he
was
trying
to
figure
to
himself
what
that
packet
must
contain
and
to
make
the
bribe
worth
while
leverett
had
concluded
that
only
a
solid
packet
of
bills
could
account
for
the
twenty
thousand
offered
there
might
easily
be
half
a
million
in
bills
pressed
together
in
that
heavy
flat
packet
bills
were
absolutely
safe
plunder
but
kloon
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
suggestions
kloon
who
never
entertained
ambitions
beyond
his
hootch
whose
miserable
imagination
stopped
at
a
wretched
percentage
satisfied
one
shot
there
was
the
back
of
kloon
bushy
head
one
shot
and
fear
which
had
shadowed
him
from
birth
was
at
an
end
forever
ended
too
privation
the
bitter
rigour
of
black
winters
scorching
days
bodily
squalor
ills
that
such
as
he
endured
in
a
wilderness
where
like
other
creatures
of
the
wild
men
stricken
died
or
recovered
by
chance
alone
a
single
shot
would
settle
all
problems
for
him
but
if
he
missed
at
the
mere
idea
he
trembled
as
he
trotted
on
trying
to
tell
himself
that
he
could
miss
no
use
always
the
coward
if
blocked
him
and
the
coward
rage
fiercest
of
all
fury
ravaged
him
almost
crazing
him
with
his
own
impotence

with

away
on
every
side
it
was
still
nearly
a
mile
from
drowned
valley
when
jake
kloon
halted
in
his
tracks
and
seated
himself
on
a
narrow
ridge
of
hard
ground
and
leverett
came
lightly
up
and
after
nosing
the
whole
vicinity
sat
down
cautiously
where
kloon
would
have
to
turn
partly
around
to
look
at
him
where
the
hell
do
we
meet
up
with
quintana
growled
kloon
tearing
a
mouthful
from
a
gnawed
tobacco
plug
and
shoving
the
remainder
deep
into
his
trousers

ta

continued
leverett
licked
his
dry
lips
his
rifle
lay
on
his
knees
almost
imperceptibly
he
moved
it
moved
it
again
froze
stiff
as
kloon
spat
then
by
infinitesimal
degrees
continued
to
edge
the
muzzle
toward

kloon
squirted
a
stream
of
tobacco
at
a
pitcher
plant
and
filled
the
cup
diverted
and
gratified
by
the
accuracy
of
his
aim
he
took
other
shots
at
intervals
leverett
moved
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
a
hair
width
to
the
left
shivered
moved
it
again
under
his
soggy
skin

unsteady

made

turn
his
head
you
gol
rammed
fool
he
said
what
you
doin
with
your
the
loud
detonation
of
the
rifle
punctuated
kloon
inquiry
with
a
final
period
the
big
bullet
struck
him
full
in
the
face
spilling
his
brains
and
part
of
his
skull
down
his
back
and
knocking
him
flat
as
though
he
had
been
clubbed
leverett
stunned
sat
staring
motionless
clutching
the
rifle
from
the
muzzle
of
which
a
delicate
stain
of
vapour
floated
and
disappeared
through
a
rosy
bar
of
sunshine
in
the
intense
stillness
of
the
place
suddenly
the
dead
man
made
a
sound
and
the
nearly
fainted
but
it
was
only
air
escaping
from
the
slowly
collapsing
lungs
and
leverett
ashy
pale
shaking
got
to
his
feet
and
leaned
heavily
against
an
oak
tree
his
eyes
never
stirring
from
the
sprawling
thing
on
the
ground
if
it
were
a
minute
or
a
year
he
stood
there
he
could
never
have
reckoned
the
space
of
time
the
sun
level
rays
glimmered
ruddy
through
the
woods
a
green
fly
appeared
buzzing
about
the
dead
man
another
through
the
sunshine
lacing
it
with
streaks
of
greenish
fire
others
appeared
whirling
gyrating
filling
the
silence
with
their
humming
and
still
leverett
dared
not
budge
dared
not
search
the
dead
and
take
from
it
that
for
which
the
dead
had
died
a
little
breeze
came
by
and
stirred
the
bushy
hair
on
kloon
head
and
fluttered
the
ferns
around
him
where
he
lay
two
delicate
butterflies
rare
survivors
of
a
native
species
driven
from
civilization
into
the
wilderness
by
the
advent
of
the
foreign
white
fluttered
in
airy
play
over
the
dead
man
drifting
away
into
the
woodland
at
times
yet
always
returning
to
wage
a
fairy
combat
above
the
heap
of
soiled
clothing
which
once
had
been
a
man
then
near
in
the
ferns
the
withering
fronds
twitched
and
a
red
squirrel
sprung
his
startling
alarm
squeaking
squealing
chattering
his
opinion
of
murder
and
leverett
shaking
with
the
shock
wiped
icy
sweat
from
his
face
laid
aside
his
rifle
and
took
his
first
stiff
step
toward
the
dead
man
but
as
he
bent
over
he
changed
his
mind
turned
reeling
a
little
then
crept
slowly
out
among
the
searching
about
him
as
though
sniffing
in
a
few
minutes
he
discovered
what
he
was
looking
for
took
his
bearings
carefully
picked
his
way
back
over
a
leafy
crust
that
trembled
under
his
cautious
tread
he
bent
over
kloon
and
from
the
left
inside
coat
pocket
he
drew
the
packet
and
placed
it
inside
his
own
flannel
shirt
then
turning
his
back
to
the
dead
he
squatted
down
and
clutched
kloon
burly
ankles
as
a
man
grasps
the
handles
of
a
wheelbarrow
to
draw
it
after
him
dragging
rolling
bumping
over
roots
jake
kloon
took
his
last
trail
through
the
wilderness
leaving
a
redder
path
than
was
left
by
the
setting
sun
through
fern
and
moss
and
wastes
of
always
as
leverett
crept
on
pulling
the
dead
behind
him
the
floor
of
the
woods
trembled
slightly
and
a
black
ooze
wet
the
crust
of
withered
leaves
at
the
quaking
edge
of
a
little
pool
of
water
leverett
halted
the
water
was
dark
but
scarcely
an
inch
deep
over
its
black
bed
of
silt
beside
this
sink
hole
the
dropped
kloon
then
he
drew
his
hunting
knife
and
cut
a
tall
slim
swamp
maple
the
sapling
was
about
twenty
feet
in
height
leverett
thrust
the
butt
of
it
into
the
pool
without
any
effort
he
pushed
the
entire
sapling
out
of
sight
in
the
depthless
silt
he
had
to
manoeuvre
very
gingerly
to
dump
kloon
into
the
pool
and
keep
out
of
it
himself
finally
he
managed
it
to
his
alarm
kloon
did
not
sink
far
he
cut
another
sapling
and
pushed
the
body
until
only
the
shoes
were
visible
above
the
silt
these
however
were
very
slowly
sinking
now
bubbles
rose
dully
iridescent
floated
broke
strings
of
blood
hung
suspended
in
the
clouding
water
leverett
went
back
to
the
little
ridge
and
covered
with
dead
leaves
the
spot
where
kloon
had
lain
there
were
broken
ferns
but
he
could
not
straighten
them
and
there
lay
kloon
rifle
for
a
while
he
hesitated
his
habits
of
economy
being
ingrained
but
he
remembered
the
packet
in
his
shirt
and
he
carried
the
rifle
to
the
little
pool
and
shoved
it
muzzle
first
driving
it
downward
out
of
sight
as
he
rose
from
the
pool
edge
somebody
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
that
was
the
most
real
death
that
leverett
ever
had
died
ii
a
coward
dies
many
times
before
old
man
death
really
gets
him
the
swimming
minutes
passed
his
mind
ceased
to
live
for
a
space
then
as
through
the
swirling
waters
of
the
last
dark
whirlpool
a
dulled
roar
of
returning
consciousness
filled
his
being
somebody
was
shaking
him
shouting
at
him
suddenly
instinct
resumed
its
function
and
he
struggled
madly
to
get
away
from
the
edge
of
the
fought
his
way
blindly
through
tangled
undergrowth
toward
the
hard
ridge
no
human
power
could
have
blocked
the
frantic
creature
thrashing
toward
solid
ground
but
there
quintana
held
him
in
his
wiry
grip
fool
mule
crazee
fellow
what
you
do
eh
for
why
you
make
jumps
like
rabbits
eh
you
expec
quintana
yes
alors
leverett
in
a
state
of
collapse
sagged
back
against
an
oak
tree
quintana
nervous
grasp
fell
from
his
arms
and
they
swung
dangling
what
you
do
by
that
eh
i
come
and
touch
you
and
my
god
one
would
think
i
have
stab
you
such
an
ass
the
sickly
greenish
hue
changed
in
leverett
face
as
the
warmer
tide
stirred
from
its
stagnation
he
lifted
his
head
and
tried
to
look
at
quintana
where
jake
kloon
demanded
the
latter
at
that
the
weasel
wits
of
the
awoke
to
the
instant
crisis
blood
and
pulse
began
to
jump
he
passed
one
dirty
hand
over
his
mouth
to
mask
any
twitching
where
my
packet
eh
inquired
quintana
jake
got
it
leverett
voice
was
growing
stronger
his
small
eyes
switched
for
an
instant
toward
his
rifle
where
it
stood
against
a
tree
behind
quintana
where
is
he
then
this
jake
repeated
quintana
impatiently

bogged

quintana
whose
perplexed
features

to
darken
where

packet

retorted
the
other
raising
a
voice
now
shrill
with
the
strain
of

new
crisis
rushing
so
unexpectedly
upon
him
i
heard
jake

a
holler

quintana
dark
tense
face
was
expressionless
when
leverett
ventured
to
look
at
him
like
most
liars
he
realised
the
advisability
of
looking
his
victim
straight
in
the
eyes
this
he
managed
to
accomplish
sustaining
the
cold
intensity
of
quintana
gaze
as
long
as
he
deemed
it
necessary
then
he
started
toward
his
rifle
quintana
blocked
his
way

wool
shirt
thrust
in
his
hand
and
drew
forth
the
packet
for
which
jake
kloon
had
died
within
the
hour
suddenly
leverett
knees
gave
way
and
he
dropped
to
the
ground
grovelling
at
quintana
feet
in
an
agony
of
fright

screamed

my
witness

by
one
foot
quintana
kicked
him
aside
and
backed
away
swine
he
said
calmly
inspecting
the
whimpering
creature
who
had
started
to
crawl
toward
him
he
hesitated
lifted
his
automatic
then
as
though
annoyed
by
leverett
deafening
shriek
shrugged
hesitated
pocketed
both
pistol
and
packet
and
turned
on
his
heel
by
the
birch
sapling
he
paused
and
picked
up
leverett
rifle
something
left
a
red
smear
on
his
palm
as
he
worked
the
ejector
it
was
blood
quintana
gazed
curiously
at
his
soiled
hand
then
he
stooped
and
picked
up
the
empty
cartridge
case
which
had
been
ejected
and
as
he
stooped
he
noticed
more
blood
on
a
fallen
leaf
with
one
foot
daintily
as
a
scratches
he
brushed
away
the
fallen
leaves
revealing
the
mess
underneath
after
he
had
contemplated
the
crimson
traces
of
murder
for
a
few
moments
he
turned
and
looked
at
leverett
with
faint
curiosity
so
he
said
in
his
leisurely
emotionless
way
you
have
fight
with
my
frien
jake
for
thee
packet
yes
ver
amusing
he
shrugged
his
indifference
tossed
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
without
another
glance
at
the
cringing
creature
on
the
ground
walked
away
toward
drowned
valley
unhurriedly
iii
when
quintana
disappeared
among
the
tamaracks
leverett
ventured
to
rise
to
his
knees
as
he
crouched
there
peering
after
quintana
a
man
came
swiftly
out
of
the
forest
behind
him
and
nearly
stumbled
over
him
recognition
was
instant
and
mutual
as
the
man
jerked
the
to
his
feet
stifling
the
muffled
yell
in
his
throat
i
want

packet
you
picked
up
on
clinch
veranda
said
hal

quintana
shot
jake
and
stuck
him
into
a
snivelled
leverett
breaking
down
and
sobbing
oh
gawd
gawd
he
down
under
all
that
black
mud
with
his
brains
spillin
out
but
smith
was
already
gone
running
lightly
along
the
string
of
footprints
which
led
straight
away
across
slime
and
sphagnum
toward
the
head
of
drowned
valley
in
the
first
clump
of
trees
smith
saw
quintana
he
had
halted
and
he
was
fumbling
at
the
twine
which
bound
a
flat
packet
he
did
not
start
when
smith
sharp
warning
struck
his
ear
do
move
i
got
you
over
my
rifle
quintana
quintana
fingers
had
instantly
ceased
operations
then
warily
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
into
the
muzzle
of
smith
rifle
ah
bah
he
said
tranquilly
there
were
three
of
you
then
lay
that
packet
on
the
ground
my
frien
drop
it
or
i
drop
quintana
carefully
placed
the
packet
on
a
bed
of
vivid
moss
now
your
gun
continued
smith
quintana
shrugged
and
laid
leverett
rifle
beside
the
packet
kneel
down
with
your
hands
up
and
your
back
toward
me
said
smith
my
frien
down
with
you
quintana
dropped
gracefully
into
the
humiliating
attitude
popularly
indicative
of
prayerful
supplication
smith
walked
slowly
up
behind
him
relieved
him
of
two
automatics
and
a
dirk
stay
put
he
said
sharply
as
quintana
started
to
turn
his
head
then
he
picked
up
the
packet
with
its
loosened
string
slipped
it
into
his
side
pocket
gathered
together
the
arsenal
which
had
decorated
quintana
and
so
loaded
with
weapons
walked
away
a
few
paces
and
seated
himself
on
a
fallen
log
here
he
pocketed
both
automatics
shoved
the
sheathed
dirk
into
his
belt
placed
the
captured
rifle
handy
after
examining
the
magazine
and
laid
his
own
weapon
across
his
knees
you
may
turn
around
now
quintana
he
said
amiably
quintana
lowered
his
arms
and
started
to
rise
sit
down
said
smith
quintana
seated
himself
on
the
moss
facing
smith
now
my
gay
and
nimble
said
smith
genially
while
i
take
ten
minutes
rest
we
have
a
little
polite
conversation
or
rather
a
monologue
because
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
from
you
he
settled
himself
comfortably
on
the
log
let
me
assemble
for
you
señor
quintana
the
interesting
history
of
the
jewels
which
so
sparklingly
repose
in
the
packet
in
my
pocket
in
the
first
place
as
you
know
monsieur
quintana
the
famous
flaming
jewel
and
the
other
gems
contained
in
this
packet
of
mine
belonged
to
her
highness
the
grand
duchess
theodorica
of
esthonia
very
interesting
more
interesting
still
along
comes
don
josé
quintana
and
his
celebrated
gang
of
international
thieves
and
steals
from
the
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
the
flaming
jewel
and
all
her
rubies
emeralds
and
diamonds
yes
certainly
said
quintana
with
a
polite
inclination
of
acknowledgment
bon
well
then
still
more
interesting
to
relate
a
gentleman
named
clinch
helps
himself
to
these
famous
jewels
how
very
careless
of
you
mr
quintana
careless
certainly
assented
quintana
politely
well
said
smith
laughing
clinch
was
more
careless
still
the
robber
baron
sir
jacobus
kloon
swiped
as
froissart
has
it
the
esthonian
gems
and
under
agreement
to
deliver
them
to
you
i
suppose
thought
better
of
it
and
attempted
to
abscond
do
you
get
me
herr
quintana
gewiss
yes
and
you
got
jake
kloon
i
hear
laughed
smith
no
did
you
kill
kloon
no
oh
pardon
the
mistake
was
natural
you
merely
robbed
kloon
and
leverett
you
should
have
killed
them
yes
said
quintana
slowly
i
should
have
it
was
my
mistake
signor
quintana
it
is
human
for
the
human
crook
to
err
sooner
or
later
he
always
does
it
and
then
the
piper
comes
around
holding
out
two
itching
palms
smith
said
quintana
pleasantly
you
are
an
unusually
agreeable
gentleman
for
a
thief
i
regret
that
you
do
not
see
your
way
to
an
amalgamation
of
interests
with
myself
as
you
say
quintana
mea
i
am
somewhat
unusual
for
example
what
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
do
with
this
packet
in
my
pocket
live
replied
quintana
tersely
live
certainly
laughed
smith
but
not
on
the
proceeds
of
this
non
pas
i
am
going
to
return
this
packet
to
its
rightful
owner
the
grand
duchess
theodorica
of
esthonia
and
what
do
you
think
of
that
quintana
quintana
smiled
you
do
not
believe
me
inquired
smith
quintana
smiled
again
allons
bon
exclaimed
smith
rising
it
the
unusual
that
happens
in
life
my
dear
quintana
and
now
we
take
a
little
inventory
of
these
marvellous
gems
before
we
part
sit
very
very
still
quintana
unless
you
want
to
lie
stiller
still
i
let
you
take
a
modest
peep
at
the
flaming
jewel
busily
unwrapping
the
packet
just
one
little
peep
quintana
he
unwrapped
the
paper
two
cakes
of
chocolate
lay
within
quintana
turned
white
then
deeply
heavily
red
then
he
smiled
in
ghastly
fashion
yes
he
said
hoarsely
as
you
have
just
said
sir
it
is
usually
the
unusual
which
happens
in
the
world
episode
six
the
jewel
aflame
i
mike
clinch
and
his
men
drove
star
peak
and
drew
a
blanket
covert
there
was
a
new
shanty
atop
camp
débris
plenty
of
signs
of
recent
occupation
everywhere
hot
embers
in
which
offal
still
smouldered
bottles
odorous
of
claret
dregs
and
an
aluminum
culinary
outfit
unwashed
as
though
quintana
and
his
men
had
departed
in
haste
far
in
the
still
valley
below
mike
clinch
squatted
beside
the
runway
he
had
chosen
a
cocked
rifle
across
his
knees
the
glare
in
his
small
pale
eyes
waned
and
flared
as
distant
sounds
broke
the
forest
silence
grew
vague
died
out
the
fairy
clatter
of
a
falling
leaf
the
sudden
scurry
of
a
squirrel
a
feathery
rustle
of
swift
wings
in
play
or
combat
the
soft
crash
of
a
rotten
bough
sagging
earthward
to
enrich
the
soil
that
grew
it
and
as
clinch
squatted
there
murderously
intent
ever
the
fixed
obsession
burned
in
his
fever
brain
stirring
his
thin
lips
to
incessant
muttering
a
sort
of
soundless
invocation
part
chronicle
part
prayer
o
god

your
big
swell
mansion

and
stared
at

then
the
deadly
light
from
his
little
eyes
shone
on
the
others
one
by
one
boys
he
said

the
hastings
boys
young
and
rash
shuffled
into
the

blommers
hesitated
glanced
askance
at

and
instantly

rather

god

i
to

die
there
for
it
never
live
to
come
outen
that
there
morass
walkin
onto
two
legs
like
a
real
man
he
moved
slowly
along
the
file
of
sullen
men
his
rifle
in
one
huge
fist
boys
he
said
i
got
first
there

gits
what
then
i
do

he
looked
up
into
the
sky
where
the
last
ashes
of
sunset
faded
from
the
zenith
then
i
do
care
he
murmured
like
not
i
creep
away
like
some
critter
find
some
lone
safe
spot
fix
me
a
long
nap
i
guess
that
be
the
way
when
eve
a
lady
down
to
noo
york
he
added
vaguely
then
still
looking
up
at
the
fading
heavens
he
moved
forward
head
lifted
silent
unhurried
with
the
soundless
stealthy
and
certain
tread
of
those
who
walk
unseeing
and
asleep
ii
clinch
had
not
taken
a
dozen
strides
before
hal
smith
loomed
up
ahead
in
the
rosy
dusk
driving
in
leverett
before
him
an
exclamation
of
fierce
exultation
burst
from
clinch
thin
lips
as
he
flung
out
one
arm
indicating
smith
and
his
clinking
prisoner
who
was
that
catamount
that
suspicioned
hal
i
worried
none
neither
hal
a
gent

he
sticks
up

but
he
a
gent
and

is
honest
or
they
ai

smith
came
up
at
his
easy
tireless
gait
hustling
leverett
along
with
prods
from
or
muzzle
as
came
handiest
the
prisoner
turned
a
ghastly
visage
on
clinch
who
ignored
him
got
my
packet
hal
he
demanded
smith
poked
leverett
with
his
rifle
tune
up
he
said

clinch
your
story
as
a
caged
rat
looks
death
in
the
face
his
ratty
wits
working
like
lightning
and
every
atom
of
cunning
and
ferocity
alert
for
attack
or
escape
so
the
little
mean
eyes
of
earl
leverett
became
fixed
on
clinch
like
two
immobile
and
glassy
beads
of
jet
said
clinch
softly
spit
it
out

pleasantly
ten
thousand
how

they
pulled
their
guns
on

and
i
was
scared

that
was
the
way
asked
clinch
in
his
even
reassuring
voice
leverett
eyes
travelled
stealthily
around
the
circle
of
men
then
reverted
to
clinch
i
dass

to
clinch
that

brought
him
along
did

drive
star
peak
there
nothin
onto
it
said
clinch
very
softly
then
of
a
sudden
his
shadowy
visage
became
contorted
and
he
jerked
up
his
rifle
and
threw
a
cartridge
into
the
magazine
you
dirty
louse
he
roared
at
leverett

into
this
too
my
little
eve
run
yelled
somebody
giving
leverett
a
violent
shove
into
the
woods
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
clinch
shouldered
his
way
out
of
the
circle
and
fired
at
the
crackling
noise
that
marked
course
fired
again
lower
and
again
as
a
distant
crash
revealed
the
frenzied
flight
of
the
after
he
had
fired
a
fourth
shot
somebody
struck
up
his
rifle
aw
said
jim
hastings
that

with
reaction
into

a
silence

said
smith
briefly
he
added
look
out
for
mike
clinch
tossed
his
heavy
rifle
to
his
shoulder
let

he
said
in
his
pleasant
misleading
way
and
i
shoot
the
guts
outa
any
fella
that

show
up
at
roll
call
iii
for
its
size
there
is
no
fiercer
animal
than
a
rat
rage
possessed
leverett
in
his
headlong
flight
through
the
dusk
fear
instead
of
quenching
added
to
his
rage
and
he
ran
on
and
on
crashing
through
the
undergrowth
made
wilder
by
the
pain
of
vicious
blows
from
branches
which
flew
back
and
struck
him
in
the
dark
thorns
bled
him
unseen
logs
tripped
him
he
heard
clinch
bullets
whining
around
him
and
he
ran
on
beginning
to
sob
and
curse
in
a
frenzy
of
fury
fear
and
shame
shots
from
clinch
rifle
ceased
the
fugitive
dropped
into
a
heavy
shuffling
walk
slavering
gasping
gesticulating
with
his
weaponless
fists
in
the
darkness
gol
ram
ye
i
fix
ye
he
kept
stammering
in
his
snarling
jangling
voice
broken
by
sobs
i
learn
ye
yeh
poor
danged
thing
gol
ram
ye
an
unseen
limb
struck
him
cruelly
across
the
face
and
a
tripped
him
flat
almost
crazed
he
got
up
yelling
in
his
pain
one
hand
wet
and
sticky
from
blood
welling
up
from
his
he
stood
listening
infuriated
vindictive
but
heard
nothing
save
the
panting
animal
sounds
in
his
own
throat
he
strove
to
see
in
the
ghostly
obscurity
around
him
but
could
make
out
little
except
the
trees
close
by
but
are
never
completely
lost
in
their
native
darkness
and
leverett
presently
discovered
the
far
stars
shining
faintly
through
rifts
in
the
phantom
foliage
above
these
heavenly
signals
were
sufficient
to
give
him
his
directions
then
the
question
suddenly
came
direction
to
his
own
shack
on
stinking
lake
he
dared
not
go
he
tried
to
believe
that
it
was
fear
of
clinch
that
made
him
shy
of
the
home
shanty
but
in
his
cowering
soul
he
knew
it
was
fear
of
another
kind
the
deep
superstitious
horror
of
jake
kloon
empty
bunk
the
repugnant
sight
of
kloon
spare
clothing
hanging
from
its
peg
the
dead
man
shoes
no
he
could
not
go
to
stinking
lake
and
sleep
and
wake
with
the
faint
stench
of
sulphur
in
his
throat
and
see
the
leeches
unfolding
in
the
shallows
and
the
big
reddish
livid
as
skinned
eels
wriggling
convulsively
toward
their
sunless
lairs
at
the
mere
thought
of
his
dead
he
sought
relief
in
vindictive
rage
stirred
up
the
smouldering
embers
again
cursed
clinch
and
hal
smith
violently
searching
in
his
inflamed
brain
some
instant
vengeance
upon
these
men
who
had
driven
him
out
from
the
only
place
on
earth
where
he
knew
how
to
exist
the
wilderness
all
at
once
he
thought
of
clinch
the
thought
instantly
scared
him
yet
what
a
revenge
to
strike
clinch
through
the
only
creature
he
cared
for
in
all
the
world
what
a
revenge
clinch
was
headed
for
drowned
valley
eve
strayer
was
alone
at
the
dump
another
thought
flashed
like
lightning
across
his
turbid
mind
bribed
by
quintana
jake
kloon
lurking
at
clinch
door
had
heard
him
direct
eve
to
take
a
packet
to
owl
marsh
and
had
notified
quintana
wittingly
or
unwittingly
the
girl
had
taken
a
packet
of
chocolate
instead
of
the
priceless
parcel
expected
again
carried
in
exhausted
by
a
state
trooper
jake
kloon
had
been
fooled
and
it
was
the
packet
of
chocolate
that
jake
had
purloined
from
the
veranda
where
clinch
kicked
it
for
two
cakes
of
chocolate
kloon
had
died
for
two
cakes
of
chocolate
he
earl
leverett
had
become
a
a
homeless
fugitive
in
peril
of
his
life
he
stood
licking
his
lips
there
in
the
darkness
striving
to
hatch
courage
out
of
the
dull
fury
eating
at
a
coward
heart
somewhere
in
clinch
dump
was
the
packet
that
would
make
him
rich
here
was
his
opportunity
he
had
only
to
dare
and
pain
and
poverty
and
fear
above
all
else
would
end
forever
when
at
last
he
came
out
to
the
edge
of
clinch
clearing
the
dark
october
heavens
were
but
a
vast
wilderness
of
stars
star
pond
set
to
its
limpid
depths
with
the
heavenly
gems
glittered
and
darkled
with
its
million
diamond
incrustations
the
lump
of
clinch
dump
crouched
like
some
huge
and
feeding
on
the
bank
ringed
by
the
solemn
forest
there
was
a
kerosene
lamp
burning
in
eve
strayer
rooms
another
light
a
candle
flickered
in
the
kitchen
leverett
crouching
ran
down
to
the
barn
slid
in
between
the
ice
house
and
crawled
out
among
the
wilderness
of
weeds
and
lay
flat
the
light
burned
steadily
from
eve
window
iv
from
his
form
among
the
could
see
only
the
plastered
ceiling
of
the
bed
chamber
but
the
kerosene
lamp
cast
two
shadows
on
that
tall
shadows
of
human
shapes
that
stirred
at
times
the
scared
stiffened
to
immobility
but
his
little
eyes
remained
fastened
on
the
camera
obscura
above
all
the
cunning
patience
and
murderous
immobility
of
the
rat
were
his
not
a
weed
stirred
under
the
stars
where
he
lay
with
tiny
unwinking
eyes
intent
upon
the
shadows
on
the
ceiling
the
shadows
on
the
ceiling
were
cast
by
eve
strayer
and
her
state
trooper
eve
sat
on
her
bed
edge
swathed
in
a
lilac
silk
kimona
delicate
relic
of
school
days
her
bandaged
feet
crossed
dangled
above
the
on
the
floor
her
slim
tanned
fingers
were
interlaced
over
the
book
on
her
lap
near
the
door
stood
state
trooper
stormont
spurred
booted
trig
and
trim
an
undecided
and
flushed
young
man
fumbling
irresolutely
with
the
purple
cord
on
his
the
book
on
eve
knees
another
relic
of
the
past
was
the
stormont
had
been
reading
to
her
they
having
found
after
the
half
shy
tentatives
of
new
friends
a
point
in
literature
and
the
girl
admitting
a
passion
for
the
poets
invited
him
to
inspect
the
bookcase
of
unpainted
pine
which
clinch
had
built
into
her
bedroom
wall
here
it
was
he
discovered
mutual
friends
among
the
nobler
victorians
surprised
to
discover
there
and
carrying
it
to
her
bedside
looked
leisurely
through
the
half
forgotten
pages
would
you
read
a
little
she
ventured
he
blushed
but
did
his
best
his
was
an
agreeable
boyish
voice
betraying
taste
and
understanding
time
passed
quickly
not
so
much
in
the
reading
but
in
the
conversations
intervening
and
now
made
uneasy
by
chance
consultation
with
his
and
being
rather
a
conscientious
young
man
he
had
risen
and
had
informed
eve
that
she
ought
to
go
to
sleep
and
she
had
denounced
the
idea
almost
fretfully
even
if
you
go
i
sha
sleep
till
daddy
comes
she
said
of
course
she
added
smiling
at
him
out
of
eyes
if
are
sleepy
i
should
dream
of
asking
you
to
stay
i
not
intending
to
sleep
what
are
you
going
to
do
take
a
chair
on
the
landing
outside
your
door
what
certainly
what
did
you
expect
me
to
do
eve
go
to
bed
of
course
the
beds
in
the
guest
rooms
are
all
made
up
your
father
did
expect
me
to
do
that
he
said
smiling
i
not
afraid
as
long
as
you
in
the
house
she
said
she
looked
up
at
him
again
wistfully
perhaps
he
was
restless
bored
sitting
there
beside
her
half
the
day
and
already
half
the
night
men
of
that
kind
active
nervous
young
men
accustomed
to
the
open
stand
caging
i
want
you
to
go
out
and
get
some
fresh
air
she
said
it
a
wonderful
night
go
and
walk
a
while
and
if
you
feel
like
coming
back
to
me
will
you
sleep
no
i
wait
for
you
her
words
were
natural
and
direct
but
in
their
simplicity
there
seemed
a
delicate
sweetness
that
stirred
him
i
come
back
to
you
he
said
then
in
his
response
the
girl
in
her
turn
became
aware
of
something
beside
the
simple
words
a
vague
charm
about
them
that
faintly
haunted
her
after
he
had
gone
away
down
the
stairs
was
the
man
she
had
once
tried
to
kill
at
the
sudden
and
terrible
recollection
she
shivered
from
curly
head
to
bandaged
feet
then
she
trembled
a
little
with
the
memory
of
his
lips
against
her
bruised
hands
bruised
by
handcuffs
which
he
had
fastened
upon
her
she
sat
very
very
still
now
huddled
on
the
bed
edge
scarcely
breathing
for
the
girl
was
beginning
to
dare
formulate
the
deepest
of
any
thoughts
that
ever
had
stirred
her
virgin
mind
and
body
if
it
was
love
then
it
had
come
suddenly
and
strangely
it
had
come
on
that
day
at
the
very
moment
when
he
flung
her
against
the
tree
and
handcuffed
her
that
terrible
instant
if
it
were
love
or
what
was
it
that
so
delicately
overwhelmed
her
with
pleasure
in
his
presence
in
his
voice
in
the
light
firm
sound
of
his
spurred
tread
on
the
veranda
below
friendship
a
lonely
passion
for
young
and
decent
companionship
the
clean
youth
of
him
in
contrast
to
the
mangy
surly
louts
who
haunted
clinch
dump
was
that
the
appeal
listening
there
where
she
sat
clasping
the
book
she
heard
his
steady
tread
patrolling
the
veranda
caught
the
faint
fragrance
of
his
brier
pipe
in
the
still
night
air
i
think
i
think
it
love
she
said
under
her
breath
but
he
could
ever
think
of
me
always
listening
to
his
spurred
tread
below
after
a
while
she
placed
both
bandaged
feet
on
the
rug
it
hurt
her
but
she
stood
up
walked
to
the
open
window
she
wanted
to
look
at
him
just
a
moment
by
chance
he
looked
up
at
that
instant
and
saw
her
pale
face
like
a
flower
in
the
starlight
why
eve
he
said
you
ought
not
to
be
on
your
feet
once
she
said
you
were
so
particular
about
my
bruises
her
breathless
little
voice
coming
down
through
the
starlight
thrilled
him
do
you
remember
what
i
did
he
asked
yes
you
bruised
my
hands
and
made
my
mouth
bleed
i
did
penance
for
your
hands
yes
you
kissed
what
possessed
her
what
irresponsible
exhilaration
was
inciting
her
to
a
daring
utterly
foreign
to
her
nature
she
heard
herself
laugh
knew
that
she
was
young
pretty
capable
of
provocation
and
in
a
sudden
breathless
sort
of
way
an
overwhelming
desire
seized
her
to
please
to
charm
to
be
noticed
by
such
a
man
whatever
on
afterthought
he
might
think
of
the
of
mike
clinch
stormont
had
come
directly
under
her
window
and
stood
looking
up
i
dared
not
offer
further
penance
he
said
the
emotion
in
his
voice
stirred
her
but
she
was
still
laughing
down
at
him
she
said
you
offer
further
penance
you
offered
your
handkerchief
so
as
that
was
you
offered
as
reparation
for
my
lips
eve
i
could
have
taken
you
into
my
arms
you
and
threw
me
down
among
the
spruces
you
really
did
everything
that
a
contrite
heart
could
suggest
good
heavens
said
that
rather
young
man
i
believe
you
have
forgiven
me
after
all
i
have
everything
except
the
handkerchief
then
i
coming
up
to
complete
my
penance
i
lock
my
door
would
you
i
ought
to
but
if
you
are
in
great
spiritual
distress
and
if
you
really
and
truly
repent
and
if
you
humbly
desire
to
expiate
your
sin
by
doing
penance
and
hesitated
do
you
so
desire
yes
i
do
humbly
contritely
yes
very
well
say
culpa
mea
maxima
culpa
mea
maxima
culpa
he
said
so
earnestly
looking
up
into
her
face
that
she
bent
lower
over
the
sill
to
see
him
let
me
come
up
eve
he
said
she
strove
to
laugh
gazing
down
into
his
shadowy
face
but
suddenly
the
desire
had
left
her
and
all
her
gaiety
left
her
too
suddenly
leaving
only
a
still
excitement
in
her
breast
you
you
knew
i
was
just
laughing
she
said
unsteadily
you
understood
did
you
i
do
know
after
a
silence
i
did
mean
you
to
take
me
seriously
she
said
she
tried
to
laugh
it
was
no
use
and
as
she
leaned
there
on
the
sill
her
heart
frightened
her
with
its
loud
beating
will
you
let
me
come
up
eve
no
answer
would
you
lock
your
door
what
do
you
think
i
do
she
asked
tremulously
you
know
i
do
are
you
so
sure
i
know
what
i
do
i
do
think
either
of
us
know
our
own
minds
i
seem
to
have
lost
some
of
my
wits
somehow
if
you
are
not
going
to
sleep
let
me
come
up
i
want
you
to
take
a
walk
down
by
the
pond
and
while
you
walking
there
all
by
yourself
i
want
you
to
think
very
clearly
very
calmly
and
make
up
your
mind
whether
i
should
remain
awake
or
whether
when
you
return
i
ought
to
be
asleep
and
and
my
door
bolted
after
a
long
pause
all
right
he
said
in
a
low
voice
v
she
saw
him
walk
away
saw
his
shadowy
form
fade
into
the
starlit
mist
an
almost
uncontrollable
impulse
set
her
throat
and
lips
quivering
with
desire
to
call
to
him
through
the
night
i
do
love
you
i
do
love
you
come
back
quickly
quickly
fog
hung
over
star
pond
edging
the
veranda
rising
in
frail
shreds
to
her
window
the
lapping
of
the
water
sounded
very
near
an
owl
was
very
mournful
in
the
hemlocks
the
girl
turned
from
the
window
looked
at
the
door
for
a
moment
then
her
face
flushed
and
she
walked
toward
a
chair
and
seated
herself
leaving
the
door
unbolted
for
a
little
while
she
sat
upright
alert
as
though
a
little
frightened
after
a
few
moments
she
folded
her
hands
and
sat
unstirring
with
lowered
head
awaiting
destiny
it
came
noiselessly
and
so
swiftly
that
the
rush
of
air
from
her
violently
opened
door
was
what
first
startled
her
for
in
the
same
second
earl
leverett
was
upon
her
in
his
stockinged
feet
one
bony
hand
gripping
her
mouth
the
other
flung
around
her
pinning
both
arms
to
her
sides
the
packet
he
panted
quick
yeh
dirty
little
cat
break
yeh
head
yeh
damn
neck
she
bit
at
the
hand
that
he
held
crushed
against
her
mouth
he
lifted
her
bodily
flung
her
onto
the
bed
and
twisting
sheet
and
quilt
around
her
swathed
her
to
the
throat
still
controlling
her
violently
distorted
lips
with
his
left
hand
and
holding
her
so
one
knee
upon
her
he
reached
back
unsheathed
his
hunting
knife
and
pricked
her
throat
till
the
blood
spurted
now
gol
ram

he
whispered
fiercely
where
mike

and
i
yeh
fur
fair
where

he
took
his
left
hand
from
her
mouth
the
distorted
scarlet
lips
writhed
back
displaying
her
white
teeth
clenched
where
mike
bundle
he
repeated
hoarse
with
rage
and
fear
you
rat
she
gasped
at
that
he
closed
her
mouth
again
and
again
he
pricked
her
with
his
knife
cruelly
the
blood
welled
up
onto
the
sheets
now
by
god
he
said
in
a
ghastly
voice
answer
or
i
yeh
next
time
where

where
where
she
only
showed
her
teeth

slit

imprisoned
knees

wounded
foot
and
tried
to
slash
the
bandages
i
cut
a
coupla
toes
yeh
he
snarled
i
hamstring
yeh
fur
keeps
struggling
to
mutilate
her
while
she
flung
her
helpless
and
entangled
body
from
side
to
side
and
bit
at
the
hand
that
was
almost
suffocating
her
unable
to
hold
her
any
longer
he
seized
a
pillow
to
bury
the
venomous
little
head
that
writhed
biting
under
his
clutch
as
he
lifted
it
he
saw
a
packet
lying
under
it
by
god
he
panted
as
he
seized
it
she
screamed
for
the
first
time
jack
jack
stormont
and
fairly
hurled
her
helpless
little
body
at
leverett
striking
him
full
in
the
face
with
her
head
half
stunned
still
clutching
the
packet
he
tried
to
stab
her
in
the
stomach
but
the
armour
of
turned
the
knife
although
his
violence
dashed
all
breath
out
of
her
sick
with
the
agony
of
it
speechless
she
still
made
the
effort
and
as
he
stumbled
to
his
feet
and
turned
to
escape
she
struggled
upright
choking
blood
running
from
the
knife
pricks
in
her
neck
with
the
remnant
of
her
strength
and
still
writhing
and
gasping
for
breath
she
tore
herself
from
the
sheets
and
blankets
reeled
across
the
room
to
where
stormont
rifle
stood
threw
in
a
cartridge
dragged
herself
to
the
window
dimly
she
saw
a
running
figure
in
the
night
mist
flung
the
rifle
across
the
window
sill
and
fired
then
she
fired
again
or
thought
she
did
there
were
two
shots

stormont
sharp
cry
what
the
devil
are

trying
to

to

his
cry
terrified
her

rifle
clattered
to
the
floor
the
next
instant
he
came
running
up
the
stairs

headed
heavy
pistol
swinging
and
halted
horrified
at

he
snatched

and
ran
somehow
i
found

rifle
and

i
fired

only
bullet

torn
his
campaign
hat
from
his
head
but
he
did
not
tell
her
let
me
see
your
neck
he
said
bending
closer
she
bared
her
throat
making
a
soft
vague
complaint
like
a
hurt
bird
lay
there
whimpering
under
her
breath
while
he
bathed
the
blood
away
with
lint
sterilised
the
two
cuts
from
his
emergency
packet
and
bound
them
he
was
still
bending
low
over
her
when
her
blue
eyes
unclosed
on
his
that
is
the
second
time
i
tried
to
kill
you
she
whispered
i
thought
it
was
leverett

there
was
a
silence

very
still

said
huskily

moment

desolately

bring
you
something
to

ca
i
promise

lie
still
he
rose
went
away
downstairs
and
out
to
the
barn
where
his
campaign
hat
lay
in
the
weed
drilled
through
by
a
bullet
there
was
something
else
lying
there
in
the
weeds
a
flat
muddy
shoeless
shape
sprawling
grotesquely
in
the
foggy
starlight
one
hand
clutched
a
hunting
knife
the
other
a
packet
stormont
drew
the
packet
from
the
stiff
fingers
then
turned
the
body
over
and
flashing
his
electric
torch
examined
the
ratty
visage
what
remained
of
it
for
his
pistol
bullet
had
crashed
through
from
ear
to
almost
obliterating
the
features
stormont
came
slowly
into
eve
room
and
laid
the
packet
on
the
sheet
beside
her
now
he
said
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
lie
awake
any
longer
i
fix
you
up
for
the
night
deftly
he
unbandaged
bathed
dressed
and
rebandaged
her
slim
white
feet
little
wounded
feet
so
lovely
so
exquisite
that
his
hand
trembled
as
he
touched
them
they
doing
fine
he
said
cheerily
you
half
a
degree
of
fever
and
i
going
to
give
you
something
to
drink
before
you
go
to
sleep
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
dissolved
two
tablets
supported
her
shoulders
while
she
drank
in
a
dazed
way
looking
always
at
him
over
the
glass
now
he
said
go
to
sleep
i
be
on
the
job
outside
your
door
until
your
daddy
arrives
how
did
you
get
back
dad
money
she
asked
in
an
odd
emotionless
way
as
though
too
weary
for
further
surprises
i
tell
you
in
the
morning
did
you
kill
him
i
did
hear
your
pistol
i
tell
you
all
about
it
in
the
morning
good
night
eve
as
he
bent
over
her
she
looked
up
into
his
eyes
and
put
both
arms
around
his
neck
it
was
her
first
kiss
given
to
any
man
except
mike
clinch
after
stormont
had
gone
out
and
closed
the
door
she
lay
very
still
for
a
long
while
then
instinctively
she
touched
her
lips
with
her
fingers
and
at
the
contact
a
blush
clothed
her
from
brow
to
ankle
the
flaming
jewel
in
its
morocco
casket
under
her
pillow
burned
with
no
purer
fire
than
the
enchanted
flame
glowing
in
the
virgin
heart
of
eve
strayer
of
clinch
dump
thus
they
lay
together
two
lovely
flaming
jewels
burning
softly
steadily
through
the
misty
splendour
of
the
night
under
a
million
stars
death
sprawled
in
squalor
among
the
trampled
weeds
under
the
same
high
stars
dark
mountains
waited
and
there
was
a
silvery
sound
of
waters
stirring
somewhere
in
the
mist
episode
seven
clinch
dump
i
when
mike
clinch
bade
hal
smith
return
to
the
dump
and
take
care
of
eve
smith
already
had
decided
to
go
there
somewhere
in
clinch
dump
was
hidden
the
flaming
jewel
now
was
his
time
to
search
for
it
there
were
two
other
reasons
why
he
should
go
back
one
of
them
was
that
leverett
was
loose
if
anything
had
called
trooper
stormont
away
eve
would
be
alone
in
the
house
and
nobody
on
earth
could
forecast
what
a
coward
like
leverett
might
attempt
but
there
was
another
and
more
serious
reason
for
returning
to
clinch
clinch
was
headed
for
drowned
valley
with
his
men
to
stop
both
ends
of
that
vast
morass
before
quintana
and
his
gang
could
get
out
it
was
evident
that
neither
clinch
nor
any
of
his
men
although
their
very
lives
depended
upon
familiarity
with
the
wilderness
knew
that
a
third
exit
from
drowned
valley
existed
but
the
nephew
of
the
late
henry
harrod
knew
when
jake
kloon
was
a
young
man
and
darragh
was
a
boy
kloon
had
shown
him
the
rocky
submerged
game
trail
into
drowned
valley
doubtless
kloon
had
used
it
in
hootch
running
since
if
ever
he
had
told
anybody
else
about
it
probably
he
had
revealed
the
trail
to
quintana
and
that
was
why
darragh
or
hal
smith
finally
decided
to
return
to
star
pond
because
if
quintana
had
been
told
or
had
discovered
that
circuitous
way
out
of
drowned
valley
he
might
go
straight
to
dump
and
supposing
stormont
was
still
there
how
long
could
one
state
trooper
stand
off
quintana
gang
no
sooner
had
clinch
and
his
motley
followers
disappeared
in
the
dusk
than
smith
unslung
his
fished
out
a
big
electric
torch
flashed
it
tentatively
and
then
reslinging
the
pack
and
taking
his
rifle
in
his
left
hand
he
set
off
at
an
easy
swinging
stride
his
course
was
not
toward
star
pond
it
was
at
right
angles
with
that
trail
for
he
was
taking
no
chances
quintana
might
already
have
left
drowned
valley
by
that
third
exit
unknown
to
clinch
smith
course
would
now
cut
this
unmarked
trail
trodden
only
by
game
that
left
no
sign
in
the
shallow
mountain
rivulet
which
was
the
path
the
trail
lay
a
long
way
off
through
the
night
but
if
quintana
had
discovered
and
taken
that
trail
it
would
be
longer
still
for
him
twice
as
long
as
the
regular
trail
out
for
a
mile
or
two
the
forest
was
first
growth
pine
and
sufficiently
open
so
that
smith
might
economise
on
his
torch
he
knew
every
foot
of
it
as
a
boy
he
had
carried
a
in
the
geological
survey
who
better
than
the
nephew
of
henry
harrod
should
know
this
blind
wilderness
the
great
pines
towered
on
every
side
lofty
and
smooth
to
the
feathery
canopy
that
crowned
them
under
the
high
stars
there
was
no
game
here
no
water
nothing
to
attract
anybody
except
the
devastating
lumberman
but
this
was
a
five
thousand
acre
patch
of
state
land
the
ugly
whine
of
the
would
never
be
heard
here
on
he
walked
at
an
easy
swinging
stride
flashing
his
torch
rarely
feeling
no
concern
about
discovery
by
quintana
people
it
was
only
when
he
came
into
the
hardwoods
that
the
combined
necessity
for
caution
and
torch
perplexed
and
worried
him
somewhere
in
here
began
an
outcrop
of
rock
running
east
for
miles
only
stunted
cedar
and
berry
bushes
found
shallow
nourishment
on
this
ridge
when
at
last
he
found
it
he
travelled
upon
it
more
slowly
constantly
obliged
to
employ
the
torch
after
an
hour
perhaps
his
feet
splashed
in
shallow
water
was
what
he
was
expecting
the
water
was
only
an
inch
or
two
deep
it
was
ice
cold
and
running
north
now
he
must
advance
with
every
caution
for
here
trickled
the
thin
flow
of
that
rocky
rivulet
which
was
the
other
entrance
and
exit
penetrating
that
immense
horror
of
marsh
and
bog
and
depthless
known
as
drowned
valley
for
a
long
while
he
did
not
dare
to
use
his
torch
but
now
he
was
obliged
to
he
shined
the
ground
at
his
feet
elevated
the
torch
with
infinite
precaution
throwing
a
light
over
the
stretch
of
sink
he
had
suspected
and
feared
it
flanked
the
flat
wet
path
of
rock
on
either
side
here
death
spread
its
slimy
trap
at
his
very
feet
then
as
he
stood
taking
his
bearings
with
burning
torch
far
ahead
in
the
darkness
a
light
flashed
went
out
flashed
twice
more
and
was
extinguished
quintana
smith
wits
were
working
like
lightning
but
instinct
guided
him
before
his
brain
took
command
he
levelled
his
torch
and
repeated
the
three
signal
flashes
then
in
darkness
he
came
to
swift
conclusion
there
were
no
other
signals
from
the
unknown
the
stony
bottom
of
the
rivulet
was
his
only
aid
in
his
right
hand
the
torch
hung
almost
touching
the
water
at
times
he
ventured
sufficient
pressure
for
a
feeble
glimmer
then
again
trusted
to
his
sense
of
contact
for
three
hundred
yards
counting
his
strides
he
continued
on
then
in
total
darkness
he
pocketed
the
torch
slid
a
cartridge
into
the
breech
of
his
rifle
slung
the
weapon
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
and
tied
it
across
his
face
under
the
eyes
now
he
drew
the
torch
from
his
pocket
levelled
it
sent
three
quick
flashes
out
into
darkness
instantly
close
ahead
three
blinding
flashes
broke
out
for
hal
smith
it
all
had
become
a
question
of
seconds
death
lay
depthless
on
either
hand
ahead
death
blocked
the
trail
in
silence
out
of
the
dark
some
unseen
rifle
might
vomit
death
in
his
very
face
at
any
moment
he
continued
to
move
forward
after
a
little
while
his
ear
caught
a
slight
splash
ahead
suddenly
a
glare
of
light
enveloped
him
is
it
you
harry
beck
instinct
led
again
while
wits
worked
madly
harry
beck
is
two
miles
back
on
guard
where
is
sard
the
silence
became
terrible
once
the
glaring
light
in
front
moved
then
become
fixed
there
was
a
light
splashing
instantly
smith
realised
that
the
man
in
front
had
set
his
torch
in
a
and
was
now
cowering
somewhere
behind
a
levelled
weapon
his
voice
came
presently
hé
gun
damn
quick
smith
bent
leisurely
and
laid
his
rifle
on
a
mossy
rock
now
you

why
you
want
sard

i
tell
sard

retorted
smith

unless

to
sard
drawled
smith
a
movement
might
have
meant
death
but
he
calmly
rummaged
for
a
cigarette
lighted
it
blew
a
cloud
insolently
toward
the
white
glare
ahead
then
he
took
another
chance
i
guess

and
after
a
dead
silence
maybe
go
to
the
chair
too
it
was
the
third
chance
he
took
there
was
a
dreadful
stillness
in
the
woods
finally
came
a
slight
series
of
splashes
the
crunch
of
heavy
boots
on
rock
for
why
you
here
eh
demanded
salzar
in
a
less
aggressive
manner

abrams
a
new
fear
had
succeeded
the
old
one
that
was
evident
and
salzar
came
forward
into
the
light
of
his
own
fixed
torch
a
figure
in
slouch
hat
grey
shirt
and
grey
breeches
and
wearing
a
red
bandanna
over
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
carried
a
heavy
rifle
he
came
on
sturdily
splashing
through
the
water
and
walked
up
to
smith
his
rifle
resting
on
his
right
shoulder
for
me
he
said
excitedly

he
glared
at
smith
started
to
move
came
back
and
took
his
torch
made
a
violent
gesture
with
it
which
drenched
the
woods
with
goblin
light

once
more
salzar
turned
and
headed
for
drowned
valley
where
clinch
would
not
fail
to
kill
him
the
man
was
going
to
his
death
and
it
was
smith
who
sent
him
suddenly
it
came
to
smith
that
he
could
not
do
this
thing
that
this
man
had
no
chance
that
he
was
slaying
a
human
being
with
perfect
safety
to
himself
and
without
giving
him
a
chance
salzar
he
called
sharply
the
man
halted
and
looked
around
come
back
salzar
hesitated
turned
finally
slouched
toward
him
smith
laid
aside
his
pack
and
rifle
and
as
salzar
came
up
he
quietly
took
his
weapon
from
him
and
laid
it
beside
his
own
da
matt
demanded
salzar
astonished
why
you
taka
my
gun
smith
measured
him
they
were
well
matched
set
your
torch
in
that
crotch
he
said
salzar
puzzled
and
impatient
demanded
to
know
why
smith
took
both
torches
set
them
opposite
each
other
and
drew
salzar
into
the
white
glare
now
he
said
you
dirty
desperado
i
am
going
to
try
to
kill
you
clean
look
out
for
yourself
for
a
second
salzar
stood
rooted
in
blank
astonishment
i
one
of
clinch
men
said
smith
but
i
ca
stick
a
knife
in
your
back
at
that
now
take
care
of
yourself
if
you
can
his
voice
died
in
his
throat
salzar
was
on
him
clawing
biting
kicking
striving
to
strangle
him
to
wrestle
him
off
his
feet
smith
reeled
staggering
under
the
sheer
rush
of
the
man
almost
blinded
by
blows
clutched
bewildered
in
salzar
panther
grip
for
a
moment
he
writhed
there
searching
blindly
for
his
enemy
wrist
striving
to
avoid
the
teeth
that
snapped
at
his
throat
stifled
by
the
hot
stench
of
the
man
breath
in
his
face
i
keel
you
i
keel
you
damn
damn
panted
salzar
in
convulsive
fury
as
smith
freed
his
left
arm
and
struck
him
in
the
face
now
on
the
narrow
wet
and
slippery
strip
of
rock
they
swayed
to
and
fro
murderously
interlocked
their
heavy
boots
splashing
battling
with
limb
and
body
twice
salzar
forced
smith
outward
over
the
sink
trying
to
end
it
but
could
not
free
himself
once
too
he
managed
to
get
at
a
hidden
knife
drag
it
out
and
stab
at
head
and
throat
but
smith
caught
the
fist
that
wielded
it
forced
back
the
arm
held
it
while
salzar
screamed
at
him
lunging
at
his
face
with
bared
teeth
suddenly
the
end
came
salzar
body
heaved
upward
sprawled
for
an
instant
in
the
dazzling
glare
hurtled
over
smith
head
and
fell
into
the
sink
with
a
crashing
splash
frantically
he
thrashed
there
spattering
and
floundering
in
darkness
he
made
no
outcry
probably
he
had
landed
head
first
in
a
moment
only
a
vague
heaving
came
from
the
unseen
ooze
smith
exhausted
drenched
with
sweat
leaned
against
a
tamarack
sickened
after
all
sound
had
ceased
he
straightened
up
with
an
effort
presently
he
bent
and
recovered
salzar
red
bandanna
and
his
hat
lifted
his
own
rifle
and
pack
and
struggled
into
the
harness
then
kicking
rifle
overboard
he
unfastened
both
torches
pocketed
one
and
started
on
in
a
flood
of
ghostly
light
he
was
shaking
all
over
and
the
torch
quivered
in
his
hand
he
had
seen
men
die
in
the
great
war
he
had
been
near
death
himself
but
never
before
had
he
been
near
death
in
so
horrible
a
form
the
sodden
noises
in
the
mud
the
deadened
flopping
of
the
sinking
body
hands
beating
frantically
on
mud
spattering
agonising
in
darkness
my
god
he
breathed
anything
but
that
anything
but
that
ii
before
midnight
he
struck
the
hard
forest
here
there
was
no
trail
at
all
only
spreading
outcrop
of
rock
under
dying
leaves
he
could
see
a
few
stars
cautiously
he
ventured
to
shine
his
compass
close
to
the
ground
he
was
still
headed
right
the
ghastly
sink
country
lay
behind
him
ahead
of
him
somewhere
in
darkness
but
how
far
he
did
not
know
quintana
and
his
people
were
moving
swiftly
on
clinch
dump
it
may
have
been
an
hour
later
two
hours
perhaps
when
from
far
ahead
in
the
forest
came
a
sound
the
faint
clink
of
a
shod
heel
on
rock
now
smith
unslung
his
pack
placed
it
between
two
rocks
where
laurel
grew
salzar
red
bandanna
was
still
wet
but
he
tied
it
across
his
face
leaving
his
eyes
exposed
the
dead
man
hat
fitted
him
his
own
hat
and
the
extra
torch
he
dropped
into
his
ready
now
he
moved
swiftly
forward
trailing
his
rifle
and
very
soon
it
became
plain
to
him
that
the
people
ahead
were
moving
without
much
caution
evidently
fearing
no
unfriendly
ear
or
eye
in
that
section
of
the
wilderness
smith
could
hear
their
tread
on
rock
and
root
and
rotten
branch
or
swishing
through
frosted
fern
and
brake
or
louder
on
newly
fallen
leaves
at
times
he
could
even
see
the
round
white
glare
of
a
torch
on
the
ground
see
it
shift
ahead
lighting
up
tree
trunks
spread
out
fanlike
into
a
wide
misty
glory
then
vanish
as
darkness
rushed
in
from
the
vast
ocean
of
the
night
once
they
halted
at
a
brook
their
torches
flashed
it
he
heard
them
sounding
its
depths
with
their
smith
knew
that
brook
it
was
the
east
branch
of
star
brook
the
inlet
to
star
pond
far
ahead
above
the
trees
the
sky
seemed
luminous
it
was
star
lustre
over
the
pond
turning
the
mist
to
a
silvery
splendour
now
the
people
ahead
of
him
moved
with
more
caution
crossing
the
brook
without
splashing
and
their
boots
made
less
noise
in
the
woods
to
keep
in
touch
with
them
smith
hastened
his
pace
until
he
drew
near
enough
to
hear
the
low
murmur
of
their
voices
they
were
travelling
in
single
file
he
had
a
glimpse
of
them
against
the
ghostly
radiance
ahead
indeed
so
near
had
he
approached
that
he
could
hear
the
heavy
laboured
breathing
of
the
last
man
in
the
file
some
laggard
who
dragged
his
feet
plodding
on
doggedly
panting
muttering
probably
the
man
was
sard
already
the
forest
in
front
was
invaded
by
the
misty
radiance
from
the
clearing
through
the
trees
starlight
glimmered
on
water
the
perfume
of
the
open
land
grew
in
the
night
air
the
scent
of
grass
the
smell
of
still
water
and
of
sedgy
shores
lying
flat
behind
a
rotting
log
smith
could
see
them
all
now
spectral
shapes
against
the
light
there
were
five
of
them
at
the
forest
edge
they
seemed
to
know
what
was
to
be
done
and
how
to
do
it
two
went
down
among
the
ferns
and
stunted
willows
toward
the
west
shore
of
the
pond
two
sheered
off
to
the
southwest
shoulder
deep
in
blackberry
and
sumac
the
fifth
man
waited
for
a
while
then
ran
down
across
the
open
pasture
scarcely
had
he
started
when
smith
glided
to
the
wood
edge
crouched
and
looked
down
below
stood
clinch
dump
plain
in
the
starlight
every
window
dark
to
the
west
the
barn
loomed
huge
with
its
ramshackle
outbuildings
straggling
toward
the
lake
straight
down
the
slope
toward
the
barn
ran
the
fifth
man
of
gang
and
disappeared
among
the
smith
crept
after
him
through
the
sumacs
and
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
squatted
low
in
a
clump
of
so
close
to
the
house
was
he
now
that
he
could
hear
the
dew
rattling
on
the
veranda
roof
he
saw
shadowy
figures
appear
one
after
another
and
take
stations
at
the
four
corners
of
the
house
the
fifth
man
was
somewhere
near
the
very
silent
about
whatever
he
had
on
hand
the
stillness
was
absolute
save
for
the
drumming
dew
and
a
faint
ripple
from
the
water
edge
smith
crouched
listened
searched
the
starlight
with
intent
eyes
and
waited
until
something
happened
he
could
not
solve
the
problem
before
him
he
could
be
of
no
use
to
eve
strayer
and
to
stormont
until
he
found
out
what
quintana
was
going
to
do
he
could
be
of
little
use
anyway
unless
he
got
into
the
house
where
two
rifles
might
hold
out
against
five
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
get
to
ghost
lake
for
assistance
he
felt
that
whatever
was
about
to
happen
would
come
with
a
rush
it
would
be
all
over
before
he
had
gone
five
minutes
no
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
stay
where
he
was
as
for
his
pledge
to
the
little
grand
duchess
that
was
always
in
his
mind
sooner
or
later
somehow
he
was
going
to
make
good
his
pledge
he
knew
that
quintana
and
his
gang
were
here
to
find
the
flaming
jewel
had
he
not
encountered
quintana
his
own
errand
had
been
the
same
for
smith
had
started
for
clinch
prepared
to
reveal
himself
to
stormont
and
then
masked
to
the
eyes
and
to
save
eve
from
a
broken
heart
and
clinch
from
states
prison
he
had
meant
to
rob
the
girl
at
it
was
the
only
way
to
save
clinch
the
only
way
to
save
the
pride
of
this
blindly
loyal
girl
for
the
arrest
of
clinch
meant
ruin
to
both
and
smith
realised
it
thoroughly
a
slight
sound
from
one
of
the
a
sort
of
attracted
his
attention
through
the
he
peered
intently
listening
after
a
few
moments
a
faint
glow
appeared
in
the
shed
there
was
a
crackling
noise
the
glow
grew
pinker
iii
inside
clinch
house
eve
awoke
with
a
start
her
ears
were
filled
with
a
strange
rushing
crackling
noise
a
rosy
glare
danced
and
shook
outside
her
windows
as
she
sprang
to
the
floor
on
bandaged
feet
a
shrill
scream
burst
out
in
the
ruddy
darkness
unearthly
horrible
and
there
came
a
thunderous
battering
from
the
barn
the
girl
tore
open
her
bedroom
door
jack
she
cried
in
a
terrified
voice
the
barn
on
fire
good
god
he
said
my
horse
he
had
already
sprung
from
his
chair
outside
her
door
now
he
ran
downstairs
and
she
heard
bolt
and
chain
clash
at
the
kitchen
door
and
his
spurred
boots
land
on
the
porch
oh
she
whimpered
snatching
a
blanket
wrapper
from
a
peg
and
struggling
into
it
oh
the
poor
horse
jack
jack
i
coming
to
help
do
risk
your
life
i
coming
i
coming
terror
clutched
her
as
she
stumbled
downstairs
on
bandaged
feet
as
she
reached
the
door
a
great
flare
of
light
almost
blinded
her
jack
and
at
the
same
instant
she
saw
him
struggling
with
three
masked
men
in
the
glare
of
the
afire
his
rifle
stood
in
the
corridor
outside
her
door
with
one
bound
she
was
on
the
stairs
again
there
came
the
crash
and
splinter
of
wood
and
glass
from
the
kitchen
and
a
man
with
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
caught
her
on
the
landing
twice
she
wrenched
herself
loose
and
her
fingers
almost
touched
stormont
rifle
she
fought
like
a
cornered
lynx
tore
the
handkerchief
from
her
assailant
face
recognised
quintana
hurled
her
very
body
at
him
eyes
flaming
small
teeth
bared
two
other
men
laid
hold
in
another
moment
she
had
tripped
quintana
and
all
four
fell
rolling
over
and
over
down
the
short
flight
of
stairs
landing
in
the
kitchen
still
fighting
here
in
darkness
she
wriggled
out
somehow
leaving
her
blanket
wrapped
in
their
clutches
in
another
instant
she
was
up
the
stairs
again
only
to
discover
that
the
rifle
was
gone
the
red
glare
from
the
lighted
her
bedroom
she
sprang
inside
and
bolted
the
door
her
chamois
jacket
with
its
loops
full
of
cartridges
hung
on
a
peg
she
got
into
it
seized
her
rifle
and
ran
to
the
window
just
as
two
masked
men
pushing
stormont
before
them
entered
the
house
by
the
kitchen
way
her
own
door
was
resounding
with
kicks
and
blows
shaking
shivering
under
the
furious
impact
of
boot
and
she
ran
to
the
bed
thrust
her
hand
under
the
pillow
pulled
out
the
case
containing
the
flaming
jewel
and
placed
it
in
the
breast
pocket
of
her
shooting
jacket
again
she
crept
to
the
window
only
the
was
burning

however
had
led
stormont
horse
from
the
barn
and
had
tied
it
to
a
tree
at
a
safe
distance
it
stood
there
trembling
its
beautiful
nervous
head
turned
toward
the
burning
building
the
blows
upon
her
bedroom
door
had
ceased
there
came
a
loud
trampling
the
sound
of
excited
voices

butt
of

a
deathly

sound
of
bolts

door

slowly
the
girl
limped
forward
still
wearing
the
hunting
jacket
over
her
quintana
made
her
an
elaborate
and
ironical
bow
slouch
hat
in

blue
eyes
to
stormont
he
was
standing
between
two
masked
men
their
pistols
were
pressed
slightly
against
his
stomach
stormont
reddened
painfully
it
was
not

said

ventured
to

with
a
terrifying
smile

the
first
gendarme
who
had

two
of
the
masked
men
laughed
loudly
outside
in
the
patch
smith
rose
stole
across
the
grass
to
the
kitchen
door
and
slipped
inside
now
señorita
said
quintana
gaily

we
leave
you

caresses

from
her
window

out
that
gendarme
too
added
quintana
grasping
eve
by
the
arm
down
the
stairs
tramped
the
men
forcing
their
prisoners
with
them
in
the
big
kitchen
the
glare
from
the
burning
fell
dimly
the
place
was
full
of
shadows
now
said
quintana
i
take
my
property
and
my
leave
where
is
the
packet
hidden
she
stood
for
a
moment
with
drooping
head
amid
the
sombre
shadows
then
slowly
she
drew
the
emblazoned
morocco
case
from
her
breast
pocket
what
followed
occurred
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
for
as
quintana
extended
his
arm
to
grasp
the
case
a
hand
snatched
it
a
masked
figure
sprang
through
the
doorway
and
ran
toward
the
barn
somebody
recognised
the
hat
and
red
bandanna
salzar
he
yelled
nick
salzar
a
traitor
by
god
shouted
quintana
even
before
he
had
reached
the
door
his
pistol
flashed
twice
deafening
all
in
the
choking
them
with
stifling
fumes
a
masked
man
turned
on
stormont
forcing
him
back
into
the
pantry
at
another
man
pushed
eve
after
him
slammed
the
pantry
door
and
bolted
it
through
the
iron
bars
of
the
pantry
window
stormont
saw
a
man
wearing
a
red
bandanna
tied
under
his
eyes
run
up
and
untie
his
horse
and
fling
himself
astride
under
a
shower
of
bullets
as
he
wheeled
the
horse
and
swung
him
into
the
clearing
toward
the
foot
of
star
pond
his
seat
and
horsemanship
were
not
to
be
mistaken
he
was
gone
now
the
gallop
stretching
into
a
dead
run
and
men
still
following
shooting
hallooing
in
the
starlight
like
a
pack
of
leaping
shapes
from
hell
but
quintana
had
not
followed
far
when
he
had
emptied
his
automatic
he
halted
something
about
the
transaction
suddenly
checked
his
fury
stilled
it
summoned
his
brain
into
action
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
unstirring
every
atom
of
intelligence
in
terrible
concentration
presently
he
put
his
left
hand
into
his
pocket
fitted
another
clip
to
his
pistol
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
straight
back
to
the
house
between
the
two
locked
in
the
pantry
not
a
word
had
passed
stormont
still
peered
out
between
the
iron
bars
striving
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
was
going
on
eve
crouched
at
the
pantry
doors
her
face
in
her
hands
listening
suddenly
she
heard
quintana
step
in
the
kitchen
cautiously
she
turned
the
pantry
key
from
inside
stormont
heard
her
and
instantly
came
to
her
at
the

out
and
take
a
chance
at

before
the
others
come
back
but
the
girl
shook
her
head
violently
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
toward
the
mouth
of
the
tile
down
which
clinch
always
emptied
his
hootch
when
the
dump
was
raided
but
now
it
appeared
that
the
tile
which
protruded
from
the
cement
floor
was
removable
in
silence
she
began
to
unscrew
it
and
he
seeing
what
she
was
trying
to
do
helped
her
together
they
lifted
the
heavy
tile
and
laid
it
on
the
floor
you
open
thees
door
shouted
quintana
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
i
give
you
one
minute
then
by
god
i
kill
you
both
eve
lifted
a
screen
of
wood
through
which
the
tile
had
been
set
under
it
a
black
hole
yawned
it
was
a
tunnel
made
of
aqueduct
tiles
and
it
led
straight
into
star
pond
two
hundred
feet
away
now
as
she
straightened
up
and
looked
silently
at
stormont
they
heard
the
trample
of
boots
in
the
kitchen
voices
the
bang
of
does
that
drain
lead
into
the
lake
whispered
stormont
she
nodded
will
you
follow
me
eve
she
pushed
him
aside
indicating
that
he
was
to
follow
her
as
she
stripped
the
hunting
jacket
from
her
a
hot
colour
swept
her
face
but
she
dropped
on
both
knees
crept
straight
into
the
tile
and
slipped
out
of
sight
as
she
disappeared
quintana
shouted
something
in
portuguese
and
fired
at
the
lock
with
the
smash
of
splintering
wood
in
his
ears
stormont
slid
into
the
smooth
tunnel
in
an
instant
he
was
shooting
down
a
polished
toboggan
slide
and
in
another
moment
was
under
the
icy
water
of
star
pond
shocked
blinded
fighting
his
way
to
the
surface
he
felt
his
spurred
boots
dragging
at
him
like
a
ton
of
iron
then
to
him
came
her
helping
hand
i
can
make
it
he
gasped
but
his
clothing
and
his
boots
and
the
icy
water
began
to
tell
on
him
in
swimming
without
effort
beside
him
watching
his
every
stroke
presently
she
sank
a
little
and
glided
under
him
and
a
little
ahead
so
that
his
hands
fell
upon
her
shoulders
he
let
them
rest
so
aware
now
that
it
was
no
burden
to
such
a
swimmer
supple
and
silent
as
a
swimming
otter
the
girl
slipped
lithely
through
the
chilled
water
which
washed
his
body
to
the
nostrils
and
numbed
his
legs
till
he
could
scarcely
move
them
and
now
of
a
sudden
his
feet
touched
gravel
he
stumbled
forward
in
the
shadow
of
overhanging
trees
and
saw
her
wading
shoreward
a
dripping
silvery
shape
on
the
shoal
then
as
he
staggered
up
to
her
breathless
where
she
was
standing
on
the
pebbled
shore
he
saw
her
join
both
hands
and
lift
them
to
her
lips
and
out
of
her
mouth
poured
diamond
sapphire
and
emerald
in
a
dazzling
stream
and
among
them
one
great
flashing
gem
blazing
in
the
starlight
the
flaming
jewel
like
a
naiad
of
the
lake
she
stood
white
slim
silent
the
heaped
gems
glittering
in
her
snowy
hands
her
face
framed
by
the
curling
masses
of
her
wet
hair
then
slowly
she
turned
her
head
to
stormont
these
are
what
quintana
came
for
she
said
could
you
put
them
into
your
pocket
episode
eight
cup
and
lip
i
two
miles
beyond
clinch
dump
hal
smith
pulled
stormont
horse
to
a
walk
he
was
tremendously
excited
with
naïve
sincerity
he
believed
that
what
he
had
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
had
been
the
only
thing
to
do
by
snatching
the
flaming
jewel
from
quintana
very
fingers
he
had
diverted
that
vindictive
bandit
fury
from
eve
from
clinch
from
stormont
and
had
centred
it
upon
himself
more
than
that
he
had
sown
the
seeds
of
suspicion
among
quintana
own
people
they
never
could
discover
salzar
body
always
they
must
believe
that
it
was
nicolas
salzar
and
no
other
who
so
treacherously
robbed
them
and
who
rode
away
in
a
rain
of
bullets
shaking
the
emblazoned
morocco
case
above
his
masked
head
in
triumph
derision
and
defiance
at
the
recollection
of
what
had
happened
hal
smith
drew
bridle
and
sitting
his
saddle
there
in
the
false
dawn
threw
back
his
handsome
head
and
laughed
until
the
fading
stars
overhead
swam
in
his
eyes
through
tears
of
sheerest
mirth
for
he
was
still
young
enough
to
have
had
the
time
of
his
life
nothing
in
the
great
war
had
so
thrilled
him
for
in
what
had
just
happened
there
was
humour
there
had
been
none
in
the
great
grim
drama
still
smith
began
to
realise
that
he
had
taken
the
long
long
chance
of
the
opportunist
who
rolls
the
bones
with
death
he
had
kept
his
pledge
to
the
little
grand
duchess
it
was
a
clean
job
it
was
even
good
drama
the
picturesque
angle
of
the
affair
shook
hal
smith
with
renewed
laughter
as
a
moving
picture
hero
he
thought
himself
the
funniest
thing
on
earth
from
the
time
he
had
poked
a
pistol
against
sard
fat
paunch
to
this
ride
for
life
life
had
become
one
ridiculously
exciting
episode
after
another
he
had
come
through
like
the
hero
in
a
lacking
only
a
heroine
if
there
had
been
any
heroine
it
was
eve
strayer
drama
had
gone
wrong
in
that
detail
so
perhaps
after
all
it
was
real
life
he
had
been
living
and
not
drama
drama
for
the
masses
must
have
a
definite
beginning
and
ending
real
life
lacks
the
latter
in
life
nothing
is
finished
it
is
always
a
premature
curtain
which
is
yanked
by
that
doddering
old
johnny
death
smith
sat
his
saddle
thinking
beginning
to
be
sobered
now
by
the
inevitable
reaction
which
follows
excitement
and
mirth
as
relentlessly
as
care
dogs
the
horseman
he
had
had
a
fine
time
save
for
the
horror
of
the
rocktrail
he
shuddered
anyway
at
worst
he
had
not
shirked
a
clean
deal
in
that
ghastly
game
it
was
god
mercy
that
he
was
not
lying
where
salzar
lay
ten
feet
twenty
a
hundred
deep
perhaps
in
immemorial
slime
he
shook
himself
in
his
saddle
as
though
to
be
rid
of
the
creeping
horror
and
wiped
his
clammy
face
now
in
the
false
dawn
a
awoke
somewhere
among
the
oaks
and
filled
the
misty
silence
with
harsh
then
reaction
setting
in
like
a
tide
stirred
more
sombre
depths
in
the
heart
of
this
young
man
he
thought
of
riga
and
of
the
red
terror
of
murder
at
and
outrage
by
night
he
remembered
his
only
encounter
with
a
lovely
child
once
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
then
a
destitute
refugee
in
silken
rags
what
a
day
that
had
been
only
one
day
and
one
evening
and
never
had
he
been
so
near
in
love
in
all
his
life
that
one
day
and
evening
had
been
enough
for
her
to
confide
to
an
american
officer
her
entire
life
history
enough
for
him
to
pledge
himself
to
her
service
while
life
endured
and
if
emotion
had
swept
every
atom
of
reason
out
of
his
youthful
head
there
in
the
turmoil
and
alarm
there
in
the
terrified
riotous
city
jammed
with
refugees
reeking
with
disease
half
frantic
from
famine
and
the
filthy
rising
flood
of
war
if
really
it
all
had
been
merely
romantic
impulse
ardour
born
of
overwrought
sentimentalism
nevertheless
what
he
had
pledged
that
day
to
a
little
grand
duchess
in
rags
he
had
fulfilled
to
the
letter
within
the
hour
as
the
false
dawn
began
to
fade
he
loosened
hunting
coat
and
cartridge
sling
drew
from
his
the
morocco
case
it
bore
the
arms
and
crest
of
the
grand
duchess
theodorica
of
esthonia
his
fingers
trembled
slightly
as
he
pressed
the
jewelled
spring
it
opened
on
an
empty
casket
in
the
sudden
shock
of
horror
and
astonishment
his
convulsive
clutch
on
the
spring
started
a
tiny
bell
ringing
then
under
his
very
nose
the
empty
tray
slid
aside
revealing
another
tray
underneath
set
solidly
with
brilliants
a
rainbow
glitter
streamed
from
the
unset
gems
in
the
silken
tray
like
an
incredulous
child
he
touched
them
they
were
magnificently
real
in
the
centre
lay
blazing
the
great
erosite
gem
the
flaming
jewel
itself
priceless
diamonds
sapphires
emeralds
ringed
it
in
his
hands
he
held
nearly
four
millions
of
dollars
gingerly
he
balanced
the
emblazoned
case
fascinated
then
he
replaced
the
empty
tray
closed
the
box
thrust
it
into
the
bosom
of
his
flannel
shirt
and
buttoned
it
in
now
there
was
little
more
for
this
excited
young
man
to
do
he
was
through
with
clinch
hal
smith
man
and
at
dump
had
ended
his
career
the
time
had
now
arrived
for
him
to
vanish
and
make
room
for
james
darragh
because
there
still
remained
a
very
agreeable
rôle
for
darragh
to
play
and
he
meant
to
eat
it
up
as
broadway
has
it
for
by
this
time
the
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
ricca
as
she
was
called
by
her
companion
valentine
the
pretty
countess
must
have
arrived
in
new
york
at
the
big
hunting
lodge
of
the
late
henry
harrod
now
inherited
by
darragh
there
might
be
a
letter
perhaps
a
telegram
the
cue
for
hal
smith
to
vanish
and
for
james
darragh
to
enter
play
his
brief
but
glittering
part
and
darragh
sequence
of
pleasing
meditations
halted
abruptly
to
walk
out
of
the
life
of
the
little
grand
duchess
did
not
seem
to
suit
his
ideas
indefinite
and
hazy
as
they
were
so
far
he
lifted
the
bridle
from
the
horse
neck
divided
curb
and
snaffle
thoughtfully
touched
the
splendid
animal
with
heel
and
knee
as
he
cantered
on
into
the
wide
forest
road
that
led
to
his
late
abode
curiosity
led
him
to
wheel
into
a
narrower
trail
running
east
along
star
pond
and
from
whence
he
could
take
a
farewell
view
of
clinch
dump
he
smiled
to
think
of
eve
and
stormont
there
together
and
now
in
safety
behind
bolted
doors
and
shutters
he
grinned
to
think
of
quintana
and
his
precious
crew
baffled
probably
already
distrusting
one
another
yet
running
wild
through
the
night
like
starving
wolves
galloping
at
hazard
across
a
waste
only
wait
till
stormont
makes
his
report
he
thought
grinning
more
broadly
still
every
state
trooper
north
of
albany
will
be
after
señor
quintana
some
hunting
and
if
he
could
understand
mike
clinch
might
thank
his
stars
that
what
i
done
this
night
has
saved
him
his
skin
and
eve
a
broken
heart
he
drew
his
horse
to
a
walk
now
for
the
path
began
to
run
closer
to
star
pond
skirting
the
pebbled
shallows
in
the
open
just
ahead
alders
still
concealed
the
house
across
the
lake
but
the
trail
was
already
coming
out
into
the
starlight
suddenly
his
horse
stopped
short
trembling
its
ears
pricked
forward
darragh
sat
listening
intently
for
a
moment
then
with
infinite
caution
he
leaned
over
the
cantle
and
gently
parted
the
alders
on
the
pebbled
beach
full
in
the
starlight
stood
two
figures
one
white
and
slim
the
other
dark
the
arm
of
the
dark
figure
clasped
the
waist
of
the
white
and
slender
one
evidently
they
had
heard
his
horse
for
they
stood
motionless
looking
directly
at
the
alders
behind
which
his
horse
had
halted
to
turn
might
mean
a
shot
in
the
back
as
far
as
darragh
knew
he
was
still
masked
with
salzar
red
bandanna
he
raised
his
rifle
slid
a
cartridge
into
the
breech
pressed
his
horse
forward
with
a
slight
touch
of
heel
and
knee
and
rode
slowly
out
into
the
what
stormont
saw
was
a
masked
man
riding
his
own
horse
with
menacing
rifle
half
lifted
for
a
shot
what
eve
strayer
thought
she
saw
was
too
terrible
for
words
and
before
stormont
could
prevent
her
she
sprang
in
front
of
him
covering
his
body
with
her
own
at
that
the
horseman
tore
off
his
red
mask
eve
jack
stormont
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
over
stormont
walked
slowly
up
to
his
own
horse
laid
one
unsteady
hand
on
its
silky
nose
kept
it
there
while
dusty
velvet
lips
mumbled
and
caressed
his
fingers
i
knew
it
was
a
cavalryman
he
said
quietly
i
suspected
you
jim

was
the
sort
of
crazy
thing

wet
i
got
to
set
her
on
my
horse
and
try
to
take
her
through
to
ghost
lake
darragh
stared
at
stormont
at
the
ghostly
figure
of
the
girl
who
had
sunk
down
on
the
sand
at
the
lake
edge
then
he
scrambled
out
of
the
saddle
and
handed
over
the
bridle
quintana
came
back
said
stormont
i
hope
to
reckon
with
him

back
to
harm
eve
we
got
out
of
the
house

swam

lake
i
have
gone
under
except
for
her
in
his
distress
and
overwhelming
mortification
darragh
stood
miserable
mute
irresolute
stormont
seemed
to
understand
what
you
did
jim

well
meant
he
said

a
moment
he
stepped
into
cover
drew
the
morocco
box
from
his
grey
shirt
shoved
it
into
his
hip
pocket
then
he
threw
off
his
cartridge
belt
and
hunting
coat
pulled
the
grey
shirt
over
his
head
and
came
out
in
his
undershirt
and
breeches
with
the
other
garments
hanging
over
his
arm

he
said

waist

out
of
that
eve
crouched
on
the
sand
trying
to
wring
out
and
twist
up
her
drenched
hair
looked
up
at
stormont
as
he
came
toward
her
holding
out
dry
clothing

what
you
can
with
these
he
said
trying
to
speak
carelessly

she
nodded
in
flushed
comprehension
stormont
walked
back
to
his
horse
his
boots
slopping
water
at
every
stride
i
do
know
any
place
nearer

ghost
lake
inn
he
said
except

darragh
cheerfully

place

is
but
i
do
want
eve
to
know
it
i
think
it
better
she
should
not
know
me
except
as
hal
smith
for
the
present
anyway
see
to
that
wo
you
as
you
wish
jim
only
if
we
go
to
your
own
house
we
not
going
to
the
main
house
she
would
anyway
clinch
has
taught
that
girl
to
hate
the
very
name
of
harrod
hate
every
foot
of
forest
that
the
harrod
game
keepers
patrol
she
would
cross
my
threshold
to
save
her
life
i
do
understand
but
it
all
right
whatever
say
jim
i
tell
you
the
whole
business
some
day
but
where
i
going
to
take
you
now
is
into
a
brand
new
camp
which
i
ordered
built
last
spring
within
a
mile
of
the
state
forest
border
eve
wo
know
that
harrod
property
i
a
hatchery
there
and
the
state
lets
me
have
a
man
in
exchange
for
free
fry
when
i
get
there
i
post
my
man
it
will
be
a
roof
for
anyway
and
breakfast
in
the
morning
whenever
you
ready
how
far
is
it
only
about
three
miles
east
of
here
that
the
thing
to
do
then
said
stormont
bluntly
he
dropped
one
sleeve
over
his
horse
neck
taking
care
not
to
touch
the
saddle
he
was
thinking
of
the
handful
of
gems
in
his
pocket
and
he
wondered
why
darragh
had
said
nothing
about
the
empty
case
for
which
he
had
so
recklessly
risked
his
life
what
this
whole
business
was
about
stormont
had
no
notion
but
he
knew
darragh
that
was
sufficient
to
leave
him
tranquil
and
perfectly
certain
that
whatever
darragh
was
doing
must
be
the
right
thing
to
do
yet
eve
had
swum
star
pond
with
her
mouth
filled
with
jewels
when
she
had
handed
the
morocco
box
to
quintana
stormont
now
realised
that
she
must
have
played
her
last
card
on
the
utterly
desperate
chance
that
quintana
might
go
away
without
examining
the
case
evidently
she
had
emptied
the
case
before
she
left
her
room
he
recollected
that
during
all
that
followed
eve
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
he
knew
why
now
how
could
she
speak
with
her
mouth
full
of
diamonds
a
slight
sound
from
the
shore
caused
him
to
turn
eve
was
coming
toward
him
in
the
dusk
moving
painfully
on
her
wounded
feet
darragh
flannel
shirt
and
his
hunting
coat
buttoned
around
her
slender
waist
clothed
her
the
next
instant
he
was
beside
her
lifting
her
in
both
arms
as
he
placed
her
in
the
saddle
and
adjusted
one
stirrup
to
her
bandaged
foot
she
turned
and
quietly
thanked
darragh
for
the
clothing
and
that
was
a
brave
thing
you
did
she
added
to
risk
your
life
for
my
father
property
because
the
morocco
case
which
you
saved
proved
to
be
empty
does
not
make
what
you
did
any
the
less
loyal
and
gallant
darragh
gazed
at
her
astounded
took
the
hand
she
stretched
out
to
him
held
it
with
a
silly
expression
on
his
features
hal
smith
she
said
with
perceptible
emotion
i
take
back
what
i
once
said
to
you
on
owl
marsh
no
man
is
a
real
crook
by
nature
who
did
what
you
have
done
that
is
unto
death
the
supreme
offer
loyalty
her
voice
broke
she
pressed
darragh
hand
convulsively
and
her
lip
quivered
darragh
with
the
morocco
case
full
of
jewels
buttoned
into
his
hip
pocket
stood
motionless
mutely
swallowing
his
amazement
what
in
the
world
did
this
girl
mean
talking
about
an
case
but
this
was
no
time
to
unravel
that
sort
of
puzzle
he
turned
to
stormont
who
as
perplexed
as
he
had
been
listening
in
silence
lead
your
horse
forward
he
said
i
know
the
trail
all
you
need
do
is
to
follow
me
and
shouldering
his
rifle
he
walked
leisurely
into
the
woods
the
cartridge
belt
sagging
across
his
woollen
undershirt
ii
when
stormont
gently
halted
his
horse
it
was
dawn
and
eve
sagging
against
him
with
one
arm
around
his
neck
sat
huddled
up
on
her
saddle
fast
asleep
in
a
birch
woods
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
divide
stood
the
log
camp
dimly
visible
in
the
silvery
light
of
early
morning
darragh
cautioning
stormont
with
a
slight
gesture
went
forward
mounted
the
rustic
veranda
and
knocked
at
a
lighted
window
a
man
already
dressed
came
and
peered
out
at
him
then
hurried
to
open
the
door
i
did
know
you
captain
darragh
he
began
but
fell
silent
under
the
warning
gesture
that
checked
him
i
a
guest
outside
she
clinch
eve
strayer
she
knows
me

the
name
of

you

darragh

hatchery

a
blind
that

and

the
horse
they
went
out
together
stormont
lifted
eve
out
of
the
saddle
she
did
not
wake
darragh
led
the
way
into
the
log
house
and
along
a
corridor
to
his
own
room
turn
down
the
sheets
whispered
stormont
and
when
the
bed
was
ready
can
you
get
a
bath
towel
jim
darragh
fetched
one
from
the
connecting
wrap
it
around
her
wet
hair
whispered
stormont
good
heavens
i
wish
there
were
a
woman
here

wish
so
too
said
darragh
she
chilled
to
the
bone
you
have
to
wake
her
she
ca
sleep
in
what
she
wearing
it
almost
as
damp
as
her
hair
he
went
to
the
closet
and
returned
with
a
man
morning
robe
as
soft
as
fleece
somehow
or
other
she
got
to
get
into
that
he
said
there
was
a
silence
very
well
said
stormont
reddening
if
you
step
out
i
manage
he
looked
darragh
straight
in
the
eyes
i
have
asked
her
to
marry
me
he
said
when
stormont
came
out
a
great
fire
of
was
blazing
in
the
and
darragh
stood
there
his
elbow
on
the
rough
stone
stormont
came
straight
to
the
fire
and
set
one
spurred
boot
on
the
fender
she
warm
and
dry
and
sound
asleep
he
said
i
wake
her
again
if
you
think
she
ought
to
swallow
something
hot
at
that
moment
the
came
in
with
a
pot
of
steaming
coffee
this
is
my
friend
ralph
wier
said
darragh
i
think
you
better
give

a
cup
of
coffee
and
to
wier
fill
a
couple
of
hot
water
bags
old
chap
we
do
want
any
pneumonia
in
this
house
when
breakfast
was
ready
eve
once
more
lay
asleep
with
a
slight
dew
of
perspiration
on
her
brow
darragh
was
half
starved
stormont
ate
little
neither
spoke
at
all
until
satisfied
they
rose
ready
for
sleep
at
the
door
of
his
room
stormont
took
darragh
offered
hand
understanding
what
it
implied
thanks
jim
hers

the
loveliest
character
i
have
ever
known
if
i
were
as
poor
as
a
homeless
dog
i

anyway
i
think
i
let
her
go

after

said
darragh
smiling
if

only
money
that
worries
you
why
not

about
a
job
to
stormont
flushed
heavily
that
rather
wonderful
of
you
jim
why
you
the
best
officer
i
had
why
the
devil
did
you
go
into
the
constabulary
without
talking
to
me
stormont
upper
lip
seemed
inclined
to
twitch
but
he
controlled
it
and
scowled
at
space
go
to
bed
you
darned
fool
said
darragh
carelessly
you
find
dry
things
ready
ralph
will
take
care
of
your
uniform
and
boots
then
he
went
into
his
own
quarters
to
read
two
letters
which
conforming
to
arrangements
made
with
ray
the
day
he
had
robbed
emanuel

to
be
sent

to
await
his
arrival
both
written
from
the
ritz
bore
the
date
of
the
day
before
the
first
he
opened
was
from
the
countess
dear
captain
darragh
you
are
so
wonderful
your
messenger
with
the
thousand
dollars
which
you
say
you
already
have
recovered
from
those
miscreants
who
robbed
ricca
came
aboard
our
ship
before
we
landed
it
was
a
godsend
we
were
nearly
penniless
and
oh
shabby
instantly
my
friend
we
shopped
ricca
and
i
fifth
avenue
enchanted
us
all
misery
was
forgotten
in
the
magic
of
that
paradise
for
women
yet
spendthrifts
that
we
naturally
are
we
were
not
silly
enough
to
be
extravagant
ricca
was
wild
for
american
i
also
yet
only
gowns
apiece
excepting
our
sport
clothes
and
other
necessaries
do
you
think
we
were
economical
furthermore
dear
captain
darragh
we
are
hastening
to
follow
your
instructions
we
are
leaving
for
your
château
in
the
wonderful
forest
of
which
you
told
us
that
day
in
riga
your
agent
is
politeness
consideration
and
kindness
itself
we
have
our
accommodations
we
leave
new
york
at
midnight
ricca
is
so
excited
that
it
is
difficult
for
her
to
restrain
her
happiness
god
knows
the
child
has
seen
enough
unhappiness
to
quench
the
gaiety
of
anybody
well
all
things
end
even
tears
even
the
red
terror
shall
pass
from
our
beloved
russia
for
after
all
monsieur
god
still
lives
valentine
ricca
has
written
to
you
i
have
read
the
letter
i
have
let
it
go
uncensored
darragh
went
to
the
door
of
his
room
ralph
ralph
he
called
and
when
wier
hurriedly
appeared
what
time
does
the
midnight
train
from
new
york
get
into
five
lakes
a
little
before
nine
you
can
make
it
in
the
flivver
ca
you
yes
if
i
start
all
right
two
ladies
you
to
bring
them
to
the
not
ray
knows
about
them
and
get
back
here
as
soon
as
you
can
he
closed
his
door
again
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
opened
the
other
letter
his
hand
shook
as
he
unfolded
it
he
was
so
scared
and
excited
that
he
could
scarcely
decipher
the
angular
girlish
penmanship
to
dear
captain
darragh
our
champion
and
friend
it
is
difficult
for
me
monsieur
to
express
my
happiness
and
my
deep
gratitude
in
the
so
cold
formality
of
the
written
page
alas
sir
it
will
be
still
more
difficult
to
find
words
for
it
when
again
i
have
the
happiness
of
greeting
you
in
proper
person
valentine
has
told
you
everything
she
warns
me
and
i
am
therefore
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
know
what
i
should
write
to
you
yet
i
know
very
well
what
i
would
write
if
i
dare
it
is
this
that
i
wish
you
to
know
although
it
may
not
pass
the
censor
that
i
am
most
impatient
to
see
you
monsieur
because
of
kindness
past
nor
with
an
unworthy
expectation
of
benefits
to
come
but
because
of
friendship
deepest
sincerest
of
whole
life
is
it
not
modest
of
a
young
girl
to
say
this
yes
surely
all
the
world
which
was
once
formal
artificial
has
been
burnt
out
of
our
hearts
by
this
so
frightful
calamity
which
has
overwhelmed
the
world
with
fire
and
blood
if
ever
on
earth
there
was
a
time
when
we
might
venture
to
express
with
candour
what
is
hidden
within
our
minds
and
hearts
it
would
seem
monsieur
that
the
time
is
now
true
i
have
known
you
only
for
one
day
and
one
evening
yet
what
happened
to
the
world
in
that
brief
space
of
time
and
to
us
monsieur
brought
together
as
though
our
meeting
were
but
a
blessed
reunion
after
the
happy
intimacy
of
many
years
i
speak
monsieur
for
myself
may
i
hope
that
i
speak
also
for
you
with
a
heart
too
full
to
thank
you
and
with
expectations
indescribable
but
with
courage
always
for
any
event
i
take
my
leave
of
you
at
the
foot
of
this
page
like
death
i
trust
my
adieu
is
not
the
end
but
the
beginning
it
is
not
farewell
it
is
a
greeting
to
him
whom
i
most
honour
in
all
the
world
and
would
willingly
obey
if
he
shall
command
and
otherwise
else
that
in
his
mind
and
heart
he
might
desire
theodorica
it
was
the
most
beautiful
any
man
ever
received
in
all
the
history
of
love
and
it
had
passed
the
censor
iii
it
was
afternoon
when
darragh
awoke
in
his
bunk
stiff
sore
confused
in
mind
and
battered
in
body
however
when
he
recollected
where
he
was
he
got
out
of
bed
in
a
hurry
and
jerked
aside
the
window
curtains
the
day
was
magnificent
a
sky
of
royal
azure
overhead
and
everywhere
the
silver
pillars
of
the
birches
supporting
their
splendid
canopy
of
ochre
orange
and
wier
hearing
him
astir
came
in
how
long
have
you
been
back
did
you
meet
the
ladies
with
your
flivver
demanded
darragh
impatiently
i
got
to
five
lakes
station
just
as
the
train
came
in
the
young
ladies
were
the
only
passengers
who
got
out
i
waited
to
get
their
two
steamer
trunks
and
then
i
drove
them
to
harrod
place
how
did
they
seem
ralph
worried
ill
wier
laughed
no
sir
they
looked
very
pretty
and
lively
to
me
they
seemed
delighted
to
get
here
they
talked
to
each
other
in
some
foreign
tongue
russian
i
should
say
at
least
it
sounded
like
what
we
heard
over
in
siberia
captain
it
russian
you
go
on
and
tell
me
while
i
take
another
hot
bath
wier
followed
him
into
the
and
vaulted
to
a
seat
on
the
deep
set
when
they
were
talking
russian
and
laughing
they
talked
to
me
and
admired
the
woods
and
mountains
i
had
to
tell
them
everything
they
wanted
to
see
buffalo
and
indians
and
when
i
told
them
there
any
enquired
for
bears
and
panthers
we
saw
two
deer
on
the
scaur
and
a
woodchuck
near
the
house
i
thought
they
jump
out
of
the
flivver
he
began
to
laugh
at
the
recollection
no
sir
they
did
act
tired
and
sad
they
said
they
were
crazy
to
get
into
their
knickerbockers
and
go
to
look
for
you
where
did
you
say
i
was
asked
darragh
drying
himself
vigorously
out
in
the
woods
somewhere
the
last
i
saw
of
them
ray
had
their
and
jerry
and
tom
were
shouldering
their
trunks
i
going
up
there
right
away
interrupted
darragh
good

no

last
night

right

those
duds
i
wore
yesterday
and
a
bite
to
eat
i
in
a
hurry
ralph
he
ate
while
dressing
disgustedly
arraying
himself
in
the
grey
shirt
breeches
and
laced
boots
which
weather
water
rock
and
brier
had
not
improved
in
a
pathetic
attempt
to
spruce
up
he
knotted
the
red
bandanna
around
his
neck
and
pinched
salzar
slouch
hat
into
a
peak
i
look
like
a
wop
he
said
maybe
i
can
get
into
the
house
before
i
meet
the
ladies
you
look
like
one
of
clinch
bums
remarked
wier
with
native
honesty
darragh
chagrined
went
to
his
bunk
pulled
the
morocco
case
from
under
the
pillow
and
shoved
it
into
the
bosom
of
his
flannel
shirt
that
the
main
thing
anyway
he
thought
then
turning
to
wier
he
asked
whether
eve
and
stormont
had
awakened
it
appeared
that
trooper
stormont
had
saddled
up
and
cantered
away
shortly
after
sunrise
leaving
word
that
he
must
hunt
up
his
comrade
trooper
lannis
at
ghost
lake
they
coming
back
this
evening
added
wier
he
asked
you
to
look
out
for
clinch
she

right
here
ca

keep
an
eye
on
her
ralph
i
stripping

cook
dinner
for
her
when
she
wakes
up
darragh
glanced
across
the
brook
at
the
hatchery
it
was
only
a
few
yards
away
he
nodded
and
started
for
the
veranda
that
be
all
right
he
said
nobody
is
coming
here
to
bother
her
and
do
let
her
leave
ralph
till
i
get
back
very
well
sir
but
suppose
she
takes
it
into
her
head
to
leave
darragh
called
back
gaily
she
ca
she
has
any
clothes
and
away
he
strode
in
the
gorgeous
sunshine
of
a
magnificent
autumn
day
all
the
clean
and
vigorous
youth
of
him
afire
in
anticipation
of
a
reunion
which
the
letter
from
his
had
transfigured
into
a
tryst
for
in
that
amazing
courtship
of
a
single
day
he
never
dreamed
that
he
had
won
the
heart
of
that
sad
hungry
child
in
rags
silken
tatters
still
stained
with
the
blood
of
massacre
the
very
soles
of
her
shoes
still
charred
by
the
embers
of
her
own
home
yet
that
is
what
must
have
happened
in
a
single
day
and
evening
life
passes
swiftly
during
such
periods
minutes
lengthen
into
days
hours
into
years
the
soul
finds
itself
then
mind
and
heart
become
twin
prophets
clairvoyant
concerning
what
hides
behind
the
veil
comprehending
with
divine
what
the
three
sisters
whisper
there
hearing
even
the
whirr
of
the
spindle
the
very
snipping
of
the
eternal
shears
the
soul
finds
itself
the
mind
knows
itself
the
heart
perfectly
understands
he
had
not
spoken
to
this
young
girl
of
love
the
blood
of
friends
and
servants
was
still
rusty
on
her
skirt
ragged
hem
yet
that
night
when
at
last
in
safety
she
had
said
to
the
man
who
had
secured
it
for
her
he
knew
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
at
such
crises
the
veil
that
hides
hearts
becomes
transparent
at
that
instant
he
had
seen
and
known
afterward
he
had
dared
not
believe
that
he
had
known
but
hers
had
been
a
purer
courage
as
he
strode
on
the
comprehension
of
her
candour
her
honesty
the
sweet
bravery
that
had
conceived
created
and
sent
that
letter
thrilled
this
young
man
until
his
heavy
boots
sprouted
wings
and
the
trail
he
followed
was
but
a
path
of
rosy
clouds
over
which
he
floated
heavenward
about
half
an
hour
later
he
came
to
his
senses
with
a
distinct
shock
straight
ahead
of
him
on
the
trail
and
coming
directly
toward
him
moved
a
figure
in
knickers
and
belted
tweed
flecked
sunlight
slanted
on
the
stranger
cheek
and
burnished
hair
dappling
face
and
figure
with
moving
golden
spots
instantly
darragh
knew
and
trembled
but
theodorica
of
esthonia
had
known
him
only
in
his
uniform
as
she
came
toward
him
lovely
in
her
lithe
and
rounded
grace
only
friendly
curiosity
gazed
at
him
from
her
blue
eyes
suddenly
she
knew
him
went
scarlet
to
her
yellow
hair
then
white
and
tried
to
speak
but
had
no
control
of
the
short
rosy
upper
lip
which
only
quivered
as
he
took
her
hands
the
forest
was
dead
still
around
them
save
for
the
whisper
of
painted
leaves
sifting
down
from
a
sunlit
vault
above
finally
she
said
in
a
ghost
of
a
voice
my
friend
if
you
accept
his
friendship
friendship
is
to
be
shared
ours
mingled
on
that
day
your
share
is
as
much
as
pleases
you
all
you
have
to
give
me
then
take
it
all
i
have
her
blue
eyes
met
his
with
a
little
effort
all
courage
is
an
effort
then
that
young
man
dropped
on
both
knees
at
her
feet
and
laid
his
lips
to
her
soft
hands
in
trembling
silence
she
stood
for
a
moment
then
slowly
sank
on
both
knees
to
face
him
across
their
clasped
hands
so
in
the
gilded
cathedral
of
the
woods
pillared
with
silver
and
the
betrothal
of
these
two
was
sealed
with
clasp
and
lip
awed
a
little
fearful
she
looked
into
her
lover
eyes
with
a
gaze
so
chaste
so
oblivious
to
all
things
earthly
that
the
still
purity
of
her
face
seemed
a
sacrament
and
he
scarcely
dared
touch
the
childish
lips
she
offered
but
when
the
sacrament
of
the
kiss
had
been
accomplished
she
rested
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
rose
and
drew
him
with
her
then
moment
came
he
drew
the
emblazoned
case
from
his
breast
opened
it
and
in
silence
laid
it
in
her
hands
the
blaze
of
the
jewels
in
the
sunshine
almost
blinded
them
that
was
moment
the
next
moment
was
quintana
darragh
had
a
chance
out
of
the
bushes
two
pistols
were
thrust
hard
against
his
stomach
quintana
face
was
behind
them
he
wore
no
mask
but
the
three
men
with
him
watched
him
over
the
edges
of
handkerchiefs
over
the
sights
of
levelled
rifles
too
the
youthful
grand
duchess
had
turned
deadly
white
one
of
men
took
the
morocco
case
from
her
hands
and
shoved
her
aside
without
ceremony
quintana
leered
at
darragh
over
his
levelled
weapons
my
frien
smith
he
exclaimed
softly
so
it
is
you
then
who
have
twice
try
to
rob
me
of
my
property
ah

recollec
yes
how
you

me
of
a
pacquet
which

only
some
chocolate
darragh
face
was
burning
with
helpless
rage
my
frien
smith
repeated
quintana
do

it

say
to
me
yes

often
it

onexpected
which

smith

he
glanced
at
the
open
jewel
box
which
one
of
the
masked
men
held
then
like
lightning
his
sinister
eyes
focussed
on
darragh
so
he
said
it
was
also
you
who
rob
me
las
night
of
my
property
what

to
nick
salzar
eh

darragh
dry
lipped
nerved
for
death
i

too
when
i
had
the
chance
but
white
you
see
at
the
insult
flung
into
his
face
over
the
muzzles
of
his
own
pistols
quintana
burst
into
laughter
ah

shot
me
you
are
quite
right
my
frien
i
say

he
laughed
again
so
hard
that
darragh
felt
his
pistols
shaking
against
his
body
so

nick
salzar
eh
continued
quintana
with
perfect
good
humour
my

voilà
he
laughed
patted
darragh
on
the
shoulder
with
one
of
his
pistols

use
why
because
you
are
a
better
man
than

nick
salzar
he
who

better
than
the
dead
then
swiftly
his
dark
features
altered
my
frien
smith
he
said
i

come
here
for
my
property
not

kill
i
have

property

i
should
be
oblige
to
say
that
also
i
am
a
fool
yaas
a
poor
damfool
without
shifting
his
eyes
he
made
a
motion
with
one
pistol
to
his
men
as
they
turned
and
entered
the
thicket
quintana
intent
gaze
became
murderous
if
i
mus
kill
you
i
shall
do
so
otherwise
i
have
sufficient
trouble
to
keep
me
from
ennui
my
frien
i
am
going
home
to
enjoy
my
property
if
you
live
or
die
it
signifies
nothing
to
me
no
why
for
the
pleasure
of
killing
you
should
i
bring
your
dirty
gendarmes
on
my
heels
he
backed
away
to
the
edge
of
the
thicket
venturing
one
swift
and
evil
glance
at
the
girl
who
stood
as
though
dazed
listen
attentively
he
said
to
darragh
one
of
my
men
remains
hidden
very
near
he
is
a
dead
shot
his
aim
is
at
your
sweetheart
body
you
understan
yes
ver
well
you
shall
not
go
away
for
one
hour
time
after
that
he
took
off
his
slouch
hat
with
a
sweeping
bow
you
may
go
to
hell
behind
him
the
bushes
parted
closed
josé
quintana
had
made
his
adieux
episode
nine
the
forest
and
sard
i
when
at
last
josé
quintana
had
secured
what
he
had
been
after
for
years
his
troubles
really
began
in
his
pocket
he
had
two
million
dollars
worth
of
gems
including
the
flaming
jewel
but
he
was
in
the
middle
of
a
wilderness
ringed
in
by
hostile
men
and
obliged
to
rely
for
aid
on
a
handful
of
the
most
desperate
criminals
in
europe
those
openly
hostile
to
him
had
a
wide
net
spread
around
him
wide
of
mesh
too
perhaps
and
it
was
through
a
mesh
he
meant
to
wriggle
but
the
net
was
intact
from
canada
to
new
york
canadian
police
and
secret
agents
held
it
on
the
north
this
he
had
learned
from
jake
kloon
long
since
east
west
and
south
he
knew
he
had
the
troopers
of
the
new
york
state
constabulary
to
deal
with
and
in
addition
every
game
warden
and
fire
warden
in
the
state
forests
a
swarm
of
plain
clothes
men
from
the
metropolis
and
the
rural
constabulary
of
every
town
along
the
edges
of
the
vast
reservation
just
who
was
responsible
for
this
enormous
conspiracy
to
rob
him
of
what
he
considered
his
own
legitimate
loot
quintana
did
not
know
sard
attorney
eddie
abrams
believed
that
the
french
police
instigated
it
through
agents
of
the
united
states
secret
service
of
one
thing
quintana
was
satisfied
mike
clinch
had
nothing
to
do
with
stirring
up
the
authorities
of
his
sort
do
shout
for
the
police
or
invoke
state
or
government
aid
as
for
the
status
of
darragh
or
hal
smith
as
he
supposed
him
to
be
quintana
took
him
for
what
he
seemed
to
be
a
young
man
gone
wrong
europe
was
full
of
that
kind
to
quintana
there
was
nothing
suspicious
about
hal
smith
on
the
contrary
his
clever
recklessness
confirmed
that
polished
bandit
opinion
that
smith
was
a
gentleman
degenerated
into
a
crook
it
takes
an
educated
imagination
for
a
man
to
do
what
smith
had
done
to
him
if
the
common
crook
has
any
imagination
at
all
it
never
is
educated
another
matter
worried
josé
quintana
he
was
not
only
short
on
provisions
but
what
remained
was
cached
in
drowned
valley
and
mike
clinch
and
his
men
were
guarding
every
outlet
to
that
sinister
region
excepting
only
the
rocky
and
submerged
trail
by
which
he
had
made
his
exit
that
was
annoying
it
cut
off
provisions
and
liquor
from
canada
for
which
he
had
arranged
with
jake
kloon
for
kloon
now
would
be
stopped
by
clinch
and
not
one
among
them
knew
about
the
rocky
trail
in
all
these
matters
were
disquieting
enough
but
what
really
and
most
deeply
troubled
quintana
was
his
knowledge
of
his
own
men
he
did
not
trust
one
among
them
of
international
crookdom
they
were
the
cream
not
one
of
them
but
would
have
murdered
his
fellow
if
the
loot
were
worth
it
and
the
chances
of
escape
sufficient
there
was
no
loyalty
to
him
none
to
one
another
no
honour
among
thieves
and
it
was
josé
quintana
who
knew
that
only
in
romance
such
a
thing
existed
no
he
could
not
trust
a
single
man
only
hope
of
plunder
attached
these
marauders
to
him
and
merely
because
he
had
education
and
imagination
enough
to
provide
what
they
wanted
anyone
among
them
would
murder
and
rob
him
if
opportunity
presented
now
how
to
keep
his
loot
how
to
get
back
to
europe
with
it
was
the
problem
that
confronted
quintana
after
robbing
darragh
and
he
determined
to
settle
part
of
that
question
at
once
about
five
miles
from
harrod
place
within
a
hundred
rods
of
which
he
had
held
up
hal
smith
quintana
halted
seated
himself
on
a
rotting
log
and
waited
until
his
men
came
up
and
gathered
around
him
for
a
little
while
in
utter
silence
his
keen
eyes
travelled
from
one
visage
to
the
next
from
henri
picquet
to
victor
georgiades
to
sanchez
to
sard
his
intent
scrutiny
focussed
on
sard
lingered
if
there
were
anybody
he
might
trust
a
little
way
it
would
be
sard
then
a
polite
untroubled
smile
smoothed
the
pale
dark
features
of
josé
quintana
bien
messieurs
the
coup
has
been
success
yes
ver
well
in
turn
then
en
accord
with
our
custom
i
shall
dispose
to
listen
to
your
good
advice
he
looked
at
henri
picquet
smiled
and
nodded
invitation
to
speak
picquet
shrugged
for
me
mon
capitaine
eet
ees
ver
simple
we
are
five
therefore
divide
into
five
ze
gems
after
zat
each
one
for
himself
to
make
his
way
out
nick
salzar
and
harry
beck
are
in
the
drowned
valley
interrupted
quintana
picquet
shrugged
again
sanchez
laughed
saying
if
they
are
there
it
is
their
misfortune
also
we
others
are
in
a
hurry
picquet
added
also
five
shares
are
sufficient
division
it
is
propose
then
that
we
abandon
our
comrades
beck
and
salzar
to
the
rifle
of
mike
clinch
why
not
demanded
georgiades
sullenly
we
shall
have
worse
to
face
before
we
see
the
place
de
there
remains
also
eddie
abrams
remarked
quintana
crooks
never
betray
their
attorney
everybody
expressed
a
willingness
to
have
the
five
shares
of
plunder
properly
assessed
to
satisfy
the
fee
due
to
abrams
ver
well
nodded
quintana
are
you
satisfy
messieurs
to
divide
disperse
sard
said
heavily
that
they
ought
to
stick
together
until
they
arrived
in
new
york
sanchez
sneered
accusing
sard
of
wanting
a
bodyguard
to
escort
him
to
his
own
home
in
this
accursed
forest
he
insisted
five
of
us
would
attract
attention
where
one
alone
with
sufficient
stealth
can
slip
through
into
the
open
country
two
by
two
is
better
said
picquet
you
sanchez
shall
travel
alone
if
you
desire
divide
the
gems
first
growled
georgiades
and
then
let
each
do
what
pleases
him
that
nodded
quintana
is
also
my
opinion
it
is
so
settle
attention
two
pistols
were
in
his
hands
as
by
magic
with
a
slight
smile
he
laid
them
on
the
moss
beside
him
he
then
spread
a
large
white
handkerchief
flat
on
the
ground
and
from
his
pockets
he
poured
out
the
glittering
cascade
yet
like
a
feeding
panther
every
sense
remained
alert
to
the
slightest
sound
or
movement
elsewhere
and
when
georgiades
grunted
from
excess
emotion
right
hand
held
a
pistol
before
the
grunt
had
ceased
it
was
a
serious
business
this
division
of
loot
every
reckless
visage
reflected
the
strain
of
the
situation
quintana
both
pistols
in
his
hands
looked
down
at
the
scintillating
heap
of
jewels
i
estimate
two
and
one
quartaire
million
of
dollaires
he
said
simply
it
has
been
agree
that
i
accep
for
me
the
erosite
gem
known
as
the
flaming
jewel
in
addition
messieurs
it
has
been
agree
that
i
for
one
part
in
five
of
the
remainder
a
fierce
silence
reigned
every
wolfish
eye
was
on
the
leader
he
smiled
rested
his
pair
of
pistols
on
either
knee
is
there
he
asked
softly
any
gentleman
who
shall
objec
who
demanded
georgiades
hoarsely
is
to
divide
for
us
it
is
for
such
purpose
explained
quintana
suavely
that
my
frien
emanuel
sard
has
arrive
monsieur
sard
is
a
brokaire
of
diamon
as
all
know
ver
well
therefore
it
shall
be
our
frien
sard
who
will
divide
for
us
what
we
have
gain
by
our
industry
the
savage
tension
broke
with
a
laugh
at
the
word
chosen
by
quintana
to
express
their
efforts
of
the
morning
sard
had
been
standing
with
one
fat
hand
flat
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
now
at
a
nod
from
quintana
he
squatted
down
and
with
the
same
hand
that
had
been
resting
against
the
tree
he
spread
out
the
pile
of
jewels
into
a
flat
layer
as
he
began
to
divide
this
into
five
parts
still
using
the
flat
of
his
pudgy
hand
something
poked
him
lightly
in
the
ribs
it
was
the
muzzle
of
one
of
quintana

sard
ghastly
pale
looked
up
his
palm
sticky
with
balsam
gum
quivered
in
quintana
grasp
i
was
going
to
scrape
it
off
he
gasped
the
tree
was
sticky
quintana
with
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
detached
half
a
dozen
diamonds
and
rubies
that
clung
to
the
gum
on
sard
palm
wash
he
said
drily
sard
sweating
with
fear
washed
his
right
hand
with
whiskey
from
his
and
dried
it
for
general
inspection
my
god
he
protested
tremulously
it
was
accidental
gentlemen
do
you
think
i
try
to
get
away
with
anything
like
that
quintana
coolly
shoved
him
aside
and
with
the
barrel
of
his
pistol
he
pushed
the
flat
pile
of
gems
into
five
separate
heaps
only
he
and
georgiades
knew
that
a
magnificent
diamond
had
been
lodged
in
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
the
eyes
of
the
greek
flamed
with
rage
at
the
trick
but
he
awaited
the
division
before
he
should
come
to
any
conclusion
quintana
coolly
picked
out
the
flaming
jewel
and
pocketed
it
then
to
each
man
he
indicated
the
heap
which
was
to
be
his
portion
a
snarling
wrangle
instantly
began
sanchez
objecting
to
rubies
and
demanding
more
emeralds
and
picquet
complaining
violently
concerning
the
smallness
of
the
diamonds
allotted
him
sard
trained
eyes
appraised
every
allotment
without
weighing
and
lacking
time
and
paraphernalia
for
expert
examination
he
was
inclined
to
think
the
division
fair
enough
quintana
got
to
his
feet
lithely
for
me
he
said
it
is
finish
with
my
frien
sard
i
shall
now
depart
messieurs
i
embrace
and
salute
you
a
bientôt

each
for
himself
and
gar
aux

sard
seized
with
a
sort
of
still
terror
regarded
quintana
with
enormous
eyes
torn
between
dismay
of
being
left
alone
in
the
wilderness
and
a
very
natural
fear
of
any
single
companion
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
en
masse
the
gang
were
too
distrustful
of
one
another
to
unite
on
robbing
any
individual
but
any
individual
might
easily
rob
a
companion
when
alone
with
him
why
why
ca
we
all
go
together
he
stammered
it
is
safer
surer
i
go
with
quintana
and
you
interrupted
georgiades
smilingly
his
mind
on
the
diamond
in
the
muzzle
of
quintana
pistol
i
do
not
invite
you
said
quintana
but
come
if
it
pleases
you
i
also
prefer
to
come
with
you
others
growled
sanchez
to
roam
alone
in
this
filthy
forest
does
not
suit
me
picquet
shrugged
his
shoulders
turned
on
his
heel
in
silence
they
watched
him
moving
away
all
alone
eastward
when
he
had
disappeared
among
the
trees
quintana
looked
inquiringly
at
the
others
eh
bien
non
alors
snarled
georgiades
suddenly
there
are
too
many
in
your
trupeau
mon
capitaine
bonne
chance
he
turned
and
started
noisily
in
the
direction
taken
by
picquet
they
watched
him
out
of
sight
listened
to
his
careless
trample
after
he
was
lost
to
view
when
at
length
the
last
distant
sound
of
his
retreat
had
died
away
in
the
stillness
quintana
touched
sard
with
the
point
of
his
pistol
go
first
he
said
suavely
for
god
sake
be
a
little
careful
of
your
gun

march
ii
guided
by
quintana
directions
the
three
had
made
a
wide
detour
to
the
east
steering
by
compass
for
the
beyond
star
pond
in
a
dense
growth
of
cedars
on
a
little
ridge
traversing
wet
land
quintana
halted
to
listen
sard
and
sanchez
supposing
him
to
be
at
their
heels
continued
on
pushing
their
way
blindly
through
the
cedars
clinging
to
the
hard
ridge
in
terror
of
but
their
progress
was
very
slow
and
they
were
still
in
sight
fighting
a
painful
path
amid
the
evergreens
when
quintana
suddenly
squatted
close
to
the
moist
earth
behind
a
juniper
bush
at
first
except
for
the
threshing
of
sard
and
sanchez
through
the
massed
obstructions
ahead
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
woods
after
a
little
while
there
a
sound
very
very
slight
no
dry
stick
cracked
no
dry
leaves
rustled
no
swish
of
foliage
no
whipping
sound
of
branches
disturbed
the
intense
silence
but
presently
came
a
soft
swift
rhythm
like
the
pace
of
a
forest
creature
in
haste
a
discreetly
hurrying
tread
which
was
more
a
series
of
light
than
sound
quintana
kneeling
on
one
knee
lifted
his
pistol
he
already
felt
the
slight
vibration
of
the
ground
on
the
hard
ridge
the
cedars
were
moving
just
beyond
him
now
he
waited
until
through
the
parted
foliage
a
face
appeared
the
loud
report
of
his
pistol
struck
sard
with
the
horror
of
paralysis
sanchez
faced
about
with
one
spring
snarling
a
weapon
in
either
hand
in
the
terrible
silence
they
could
hear
something
heavy
floundering
in
the
bushes
choking
moaning
thudding
on
the
ground
sanchez
began
to
creep
back
sard
more
dead
than
alive
crawled
at
his
heels
presently
they
saw
quintana
waist
deep
in
juniper
looking
down
at
something
and
when
they
drew
closer
they
saw
georgiades
lying
on
his
back
under
a
cedar
the
whole
front
of
his
shirt
from
chest
to
belly
a
sopping
mess
of
blood
there
seemed
no
need
of
explanation
the
dead
greek
lay
there
where
he
had
not
been
expected
and
his
two
pistols
lay
beside
him
where
they
had
fallen
sanchez
looked
stealthily
at
quintana
who
said
softly
bien
sure
in
his
left
side
pocket
i
believe
sanchez
laid
a
cool
hand
on
the
dead
man
heart
then
satisfied
rummaged
until
he
found
georgiades
share
of
the
loot
sard
hurriedly
displaying
a
pair
of
clean
but
shaky
hands
made
the
division
when
the
three
men
had
silently
pocketed
what
was
allotted
to
each
quintana
pushed
curiously
at
the
dead
man
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
peste
he
remarked
i
had
place
for
security
a
ver
large
diamon
in
my
pistol
barrel
now
it
is
within
the
interior
of
this
gentleman
he
turned
to
sanchez
i
sell
him
to
you
one
sapphire
yes
sanchez
shook
his
head
with
a
slight
sneer
we
wait
if
you
want
your
diamond
mon
capitaine
quintana
hesitated
then
made
a
grimace
and
shook
his
head
no
he
said
he
has
swallow
let
him
digest
allons
march
but
after
they
had
gone
on
two
hundred
yards
perhaps
sanchez
stopped
well
inquired
quintana
then
with
a
sneer
i
now
recollec
that
once
you
have
been
a
butcher
in
madrid
suit
your
sanchez
sard
gazed
at
sanchez
out
of
sickened
eyes
you
keep
away
from
me
until
you
washed
yourself
he
burst
out
revolted
do
you
come
near
me
till
you
clean
quintana
laughed
and
seated
himself
sanchez
with
a
glance
at
him
turned
and
sneaked
back
on
the
trail
they
had
traversed
before
he
was
out
of
sight
sard
saw
him
fish
out
a
spanish
knife
from
his
hip
pocket
and
unclasp
it
almost
nauseated
he
turned
on
quintana
in
a
sort
of
frightened
fury
come
on
he
said
hoarsely
i
do
want
to
travel
with
that
man
i
wo
associate
with
a
ghoul
my
god
i
a
respectable
business
man
yaas
drawled
quintana
tha
what
i
saw
always
my
sard
he
is
ver
an
i
trus
him
like
i
trus
however
after
a
moment
quintana
got
up
from
the
fallen
tree
where
he
had
been
seated
as
he
passed
sard
he
looked
curiously
into
the
man
frightened
eyes
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
sard
was
a
coward
you
shall
walk
behin
me
remarked
quintana
carelessly
if
sanchez
fin
us
it
is
well
if
he
shall
not
that
also
is
ver
well
we
go
now
sanchez
made
no
effort
to
find
them
they
had
been
gone
half
an
hour
before
he
had
finished
the
business
that
had
turned
him
back
after
that
he
wandered
about
hunting
for
water
a
rivulet
a
puddle
anything
but
the
wet
ground
proved
wet
only
on
the
surface
moss
sanchez
needed
more
than
damp
moss
for
his
toilet
casting
about
him
hither
and
thither
for
some
depression
that
might
indicate
a
stream
he
came
to
a
heavily
wooded
slope
and
descended
it
there
was
a
bog
at
the
foot
with
his
fouled
hands
he
dug
out
a
basin
which
filled
up
full
of
reddish
water
discoloured
by
alders
but
the
water
was
redder
still
when
his
toilet
ended
as
he
stood
there
examining
his
clothing
and
washing
what
he
could
of
the
ominous
stains
from
sleeve
and
shoe
very
far
away
to
the
north
he
heard
a
curious
noise
a
far
faint
sound
such
as
he
never
before
had
heard
if
it
were
a
voice
of
any
sort
there
was
nothing
human
about
it
probably
some
sort
of
unknown
bird
perhaps
a
bird
of
prey
that
was
natural
considering
the
attraction
that
georgiades
would
have
for
such
creatures
if
it
were
a
bird
it
must
be
a
large
one
he
thought
because
there
was
a
certain
volume
to
the
cry
perhaps
it
was
a
beast
after
all
some
unknown
beast
of
the
forest
sanchez
was
suddenly
afraid
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
began
to
run
along
the
edge
of
the
bog
first
growth
timber
skirted
it
running
was
unobstructed
by
underbrush
with
his
startled
ears
full
of
the
alarming
and
unknown
sound
he
ran
through
the
woods
under
gigantic
pines
which
spread
a
soft
green
twilight
around
him
he
was
tired
or
thought
he
was
but
the
alarming
sounds
were
filling
his
ears
now
the
entire
forest
seemed
full
of
them
echoing
in
all
directions
coming
in
upon
him
from
everywhere
so
that
he
knew
not
in
which
direction
to
run
but
he
could
not
stop
demoralised
he
darted
this
way
and
that
terror
winged
his
feet
the
air
vibrated
above
and
around
him
with
the
dreadful
unearthly
sounds
the
next
instant
he
fell
headlong
over
a
ledge
struck
water
felt
himself
whirled
around
in
the
icy
rushing
current
rolled
over
tumbled
through
rapids
blinded
deafened
choked
swept
helplessly
in
a
vast
green
wall
of
water
toward
something
that
thundered
in
his
brain
an
instant
then
dashed
it
into
roaring
chaos
half
a
mile
down
the
turbulent
outlet
of
star
pond
where
a
great
sheet
of
green
water
pours
thirty
feet
into
the
tossing
foam
below
and
spinning
dipping
diving
bobbing
up
like
a
lost
log
after
the
drive
the
body
of
señor
sanchez
danced
all
alone
in
the
wilderness
spilling
from
soggy
pockets
diamonds
sapphires
rubies
emeralds
into
crystal
caves
where
only
the
shadows
of
slim
trout
stirred
very
far
away
to
the
eastward
quintana
stood
listening
clutching
sard
by
one
sleeve
to
silence
him
presently
he
said
my
frien
somebody
is
hunting
with
houn
in
this
fores
maybe
they
are
not
hunting
but
for
me
i
shall
seek
running
water
go
you
your
own
way
houp
vamose
he
turned
westward
but
he
had
taken
scarcely
a
dozen
strides
when
sard
came
panting
after
him
do
leave
me
gasped
the
terrified
diamond
broker
i
do
know
where
to
go
quintana
faced
him
abruptly
with
a
terrifying
smile
and
glimmer
of
white
teeth
and
shoved
a
pistol
into
the
fold
of
fat
beneath
double
chin
you
hear
those
dogs
yes
ver
well
i
also
run
now
i
say
to
you
run
ver
damn
quick
hé
houp
allez
vous
en
beat
eet
he
struck
sard
a
stinging
blow
on
his
fleshy
ear
with
the
pistol
barrel
and
sard
gave
a
muffled
shriek
which
was
more
like
the
squeak
of
a
frightened
animal
my
god
quintana
he
sobbed
then
quintana
eyes
blazed
murder
and
sard
turned
and
ran
lumbering
through
the
thicket
like
a
stampeded
ox
crashing
on
amid
withered
brake
white
birch
scrub
and
brier
not
knowing
whither
he
was
headed
crazed
with
terror
quintana
watched
his
flight
for
a
moment
then
pistol
swinging
he
ran
in
the
opposite
direction
eastward
speeding
lithely
as
a
cat
down
a
long
wooded
slope
which
promised
running
water
at
the
foot
sard
could
not
run
very
far
he
could
scarcely
stand
when
he
pulled
up
and
clung
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
more
dead
than
alive
he
embraced
the
tree
gulping
horribly
for
air
every
organ
labouring
his
senses
swimming
as
he
sagged
there
gripping
his
support
on
shaking
knees
by
degrees
his
senses
began
to
return
he
could
hear
the
dogs
now
vaguely
as
in
a
nightmare
but
after
a
little
while
he
began
to
believe
that
their
hysterical
yelping
was
really
growing
more
distant
then
this
man
whose
every
breath
was
an
outrage
on
god
prayed
he
prayed
that
the
hounds
would
follow
quintana
come
up
with
him
drag
him
down
worry
him
tear
him
to
shreds
of
flesh
and
clothing
he
listened
and
prayed
alternately
after
a
while
he
no
longer
prayed
but
concentrated
on
his
ears
surely
surely
the
diabolical
sound
was
growing
less
distinct
it
was
changing
direction
too
but
whether
in
quintana
direction
or
not
sard
could
not
tell
he
was
no
woodsman
he
was
completely
turned
around
he
looked
upward
through
a
dense
yellow
foliage
but
all
was
grey
in
the
sky
very
grey
and
still
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
traces
of
the
sun
that
had
been
shining
he
looked
fearfully
around
trees
trees
and
more
trees
no
break
no
glimmer
nothing
to
guide
him
teach
him
he
could
see
perhaps
fifty
feet
no
further
in
panic
he
started
to
move
on
that
is
what
fright
invariably
does
to
those
ignorant
of
the
forest
terror
starts
them
moving
sobbing
frightened
almost
witless
he
had
been
floundering
forward
for
over
an
hour
and
had
made
circle
after
circle
without
knowing
when
by
chance
he
set
foot
in
a
perfectly
plain
trail
emotion
overpowered
him
he
was
too
overcome
to
stir
for
a
while
at
length
however
he
tottered
off
down
the
trail
oblivious
as
to
what
direction
he
was
taking
animated
only
by
a
sort
of
madness
horror
of
trees
an
insane
necessity
to
see
open
ground
get
into
it
and
lie
down
on
it
and
now
directly
ahead
he
saw
clear
grey
sky
low
through
the
trees
the
wood
edge
he
began
to
run
as
he
emerged
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
in
brush
and
weeds
wide
before
his
eyes
spread
star
pond
even
in
his
brain
there
was
memory
enough
left
for
recognition
he
remembered
the
lake
his
gaze
travelled
to
the
westward
and
he
saw
clinch
dump
standing
below
stark
silent
the
doors
swinging
open
in
the
wind
when
terror
had
subsided
in
a
measure
and
some
of
his
trembling
strength
returned
he
got
up
out
of
the
clump
of
where
he
had
lain
down
and
earnestly
nosed
the
unpainted
house
listening
with
all
his
ears
there
was
not
a
sound
save
the
soughing
of
autumn
winds
and
the
delicate
rattle
of
falling
leaves
in
the
woods
behind
him
he
needed
food
and
rest
he
gazed
earnestly
at
the
house
nothing
stirred
there
save
the
open
doors
swinging
idly
in
every
vagrant
wind
he
ventured
down
a
little
way
near
enough
to
see
the
black
cinders
of
the
burned
barn
and
close
enough
to
hear
the
lake
waters
slapping
the
sandy
shore
if
he
dared
and
after
a
long
while
he
ventured
to
waddle
nearer
slinking
through
brush
and
frosted
weed
creeping
behind
boulders
edging
always
closer
and
closer
to
that
silent
house
where
nothing
moved
except
the
door
and
now
at
last
he
set
a
furtive
foot
upon
the
threshold
stood
listening
in
peered
here
and
there
sidled
to
the
peered
in
when
at
length
emanuel
sard
discovered
that
clinch
dump
was
tenantless
he
made
straight
for
the
pantry
here
was
cheese
crackers
an
apple
pie
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
beer
he
loaded
his
arms
with
all
they
could
carry
stole
through
the
out
to
the
veranda
which
overlooked
the
lake
here
hidden
in
the
doorway
he
could
watch
the
road
from
ghost
lake
and
survey
the
hillside
down
which
an
intruder
must
come
from
the
forest
and
here
sard
slaked
his
raging
thirst
and
satiated
the
gnawing
appetite
of
the
obese
than
which
there
is
no
crueller
torment
to
an
inert
liver
and
distended
paunch
munching
guzzling
watching
sard
squatted
just
within
the
veranda
doorway
anxiously
considering
his
chances
he
knew
where
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
and
eastward
he
had
been
robbed
by
a
highwayman
on
the
forest
road
branching
from
the
main
highway
southwest
lay
ghost
lake
and
the
inn
somewhere
between
these
two
points
he
must
try
to
cross
the
state
road
after
that
comparative
safety
for
the
miles
that
still
would
lie
between
him
and
distant
civilisation
seemed
as
nothing
to
the
horror
of
that
hell
of
trees
he
looked
up
now
at
the
shaggy
fringing
woods
shuddered
opened
another
bottle
of
beer
in
all
that
panorama
of
forest
swale
and
water
the
only
thing
that
had
alarmed
him
at
all
by
moving
was
something
in
the
water
when
first
he
noticed
it
he
almost
swooned
for
he
took
it
to
be
a
swimming
dog
in
his
agitation
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
then
the
swimming
creature
almost
frightened
sard
out
of
his
senses
for
it
tilted
suddenly
and
went
down
with
a
report
like
the
crack
of
a
pistol
however
when
sard
regained
control
of
his
wits
he
realised
that
a
swimming
dog
does
dive
and
does
whack
the
water
with
its
tail
he
dimly
remembered
hearing
that
beavers
behaved
that
way
watching
the
water
he
saw
the
thing
out
there
in
the
lake
again
swimming
in
erratic
circles
its
big
head
well
out
of
the
water
it
certainly
was
no
dog
a
beaver
maybe
whatever
it
was
sard
care
any
longer
idly
he
watched
it
sometimes
when
it
swam
very
near
he
made
a
sudden
motion
with
his
fat
arm
and
crack
with
a
report
down
it
dived
but
always
it
reappeared
what
had
a
creature
like
that
to
do
with
him
sard
watched
it
with
failing
interest
thinking
of
other
things
of
quintana
and
the
chances
that
the
dogs
had
caught
him
of
sanchez
the
ghoul
hoping
that
dire
misfortune
might
overtake
him
too
of
the
dead
man
sprawling
under
the
all
sopping
crimson
faugh
shivering
sard
filled
his
mouth
with
and
cheese
and
pulled
the
cork
from
another
bottle
of
beer
iii
about
that
time
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
southward
james
darragh
came
out
on
the
rocky
and
rushing
outlet
to
star
pond
over
his
shoulder
was
a
rifle
and
all
around
him
ran
dogs
big
powerful
dogs
built
like
foxhounds
but
with
the
rough
wiry
coats
of
airedales
even
rougher
of
ear
and
features
the
dogs
half
a
dozen
or
so
in
number
seemed
very
tired
all
ran
down
eagerly
to
the
water
and
drank
and
slobbered
and
panted
lolling
their
tongues
and
slaking
their
thirst
again
and
again
along
the
swirling
edge
of
a
deep
trout
pool
darragh
rifle
lay
in
the
hollow
of
his
left
arm
his
khaki
waistcoat
was
set
with
loops
full
of
cartridges
from
his
left
wrist
hung
a
whip
now
he
laid
aside
his
rifle
and
whip
took
from
the
pocket
of
his
shooting
coat
three
or
four
leather
went
down
among
the
dogs
and
coupled
them
up
they
followed
him
back
to
the
bank
above
here
he
sat
down
on
a
rock
and
inspected
his
watch
he
had
been
seated
there
for
ten
minutes
possibly
with
his
tired
dogs
lying
around
him
when
just
above
him
he
saw
a
state
trooper
emerge
from
the
woods
on
foot
carrying
a
rifle
over
one
shoulder
jack
he
called
in
a
guarded
voice
trooper
stormont
turned
caught
sight
of
darragh
made
a
signal
of
recognition
and
came
toward
him
darragh
said
your
mate
trooper
lannis

stream
i
two
of
my

foresters
and
an
inspector
out
toward
owl
marsh
stormont
nodded
looked
down
at
the
dogs
this
is
the
state
forest
said
darragh
smiling
then
his
face
grew
grave
how
is

he
asked

stormont
i
telephoned
to

lake
inn

hotel

mortal
enemy

said
stormont
there
was
a
silence
the
state
trooper
looked
down
at
the
dogs
what
are
they
jim
said
darragh
a
breed
of
my
own
but
that
they
are
capable
of
hunting
i
guess
he
added
grimly
stormont
gaze
questioned
him
darragh
said
after
i
telephoned
you
this
morning
that
a
guest
of
mine
at
harrod
place
and
i
had
been
stuck
up
and
robbed
by
outfit
what
did
you
do
jack
i
called
up
bill
lannis
first
said
stormont
then
the
doctor
after
he
came
ray
arrived
with
a
maid
then
i
went
in
and
spoke
to
eve
then
i
did
what
you
suggested
i
crossed
the
forest
diagonally
toward
the
scaur
north
turned
by
the
rock
south
of
drowned
valley
came
southeast
circled
west
and
came
out
here
as
you
asked
me
to
almost
on
the
minute
nodded
darragh
you
saw
no
signs
of
quintana
gang
none
well
said
darragh
i
left
my
two
guests
at
harrod
place
to
amuse
each
other
got
out
three
couple
of
my
and
started
them
as
i
hoped
and
supposed
on
quintana
trail
what
happened
inquired
stormont
curiously
well
i
do
know
i
think
they
were
following
some
of
gang
for
a
while
anyway
after
that
god
knows
deer
hare
do
know
they
yelled
their
bally
heads
off
i
on
the
run
they
slow
dogs
you
know
and
whatever
they
were
after
either
fooled
them
or
there
were
too
many
trails
i
made
a
mistake
that
all
these
poor
beasts
do
know
anything
except
an
otter
i
just
they
might
take
quintana
trail
if
i
put
them
on
it
well
said
stormont
it
ca
be
helped
now
i
told
bill
lannis
that
we
rendezvous
at
clinch
dump
all
right
nodded
darragh
let
keep
to
the
open
my
dogs
are
leashed
couples
they
had
been
walking
for
twenty
minutes
possibly
exchanging
scarcely
a
word
and
they
were
now
nearing
the
hilly
basin
where
star
pond
lay
when
darragh
said
abruptly
i
going
to
tell
you
about
things
jack
you
taken
my
word
so
far
that
it
all
right
naturally
said
stormont
simply
the
two
men
who
had
been
brother
officers
in
the
great
war
glanced
at
each
other
slightly
smiling
here
it
is
then
said
darragh
when
i
was
on
duty
in
riga
for
the
intelligence
department
i
met
two
ladies
in
dire
distress
whose
mansion
had
been
burned
and
looted
supposedly
by
the
bolsheviki
they
were
actually
hungry
and
penniless
the
only
clothing
they
possessed
they
were
wearing
these
ladies
were
the
countess
and
a
young
girl
theodorica
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
i
did
what
i
could
for
them
after
a
while
in
the
course
of
other
duty
i
found
out
that
the
bolsheviki
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
arson
and
robbery
but
that
the
crime
had
been
perpetrated
by
josé
quintana
gang
of
international
crooks
masquerading
as
bolsheviki
stormont
nodded
i
also
came
across
similar
cases
he
remarked
well
this
was
a
flagrant
example
quintana
had
burnt
the
château
and
had
made
off
with
over
two
million
dollars
worth
of
the
little
grand
duchess
jewels
among
them
the
famous
erosite
gem
known
as
the
flaming
jewel
i
heard
of
it
there
are
only
two
others
known
well
i
did
what
i
could
with
the
esthonian
police
who
did
believe
me
but
a
short
time
ago
the
countess
orloff
sent
me
word
that
quintana
really
was
the
guilty
one
and
that
he
had
started
for
america
i
been
after
him
ever
since
but
jack
until
this
morning
quintana
did
not
possess
these
stolen
jewels
did
what
clinch
served
in
a
forestry
regiment
in
paris
he
robbed
quintana
of
these
jewels
that
why
i
been
hanging
around
clinch
stormont
face
was
flushed
and
incredulous
then
it
lost
colour
as
he
thought
of
the
jewels
that
eve
had
concealed
the
gems
for
which
she
had
risked
her
life
he
said
but
you
tell
me
quintana
robbed
you
this
morning
he
did
the
little
grand
duchess
and
the
countess
are
my
guests
at
harrod
place
last
night
i
snatched
the
case
containing
these
gems
from
fingers
this
morning
as
i
offered
them
to
the
grand
duchess
quintana
coolly
stepped
between
us
his
voice
became
bitter
and
his
features
reddened
with
rage
poorly
controlled
by
god
jack
i
should
have
shot
quintana
when
the
opportunity
offered
twice
i
had
the
chance
the
next
time
i
shall
kill
him
any
way
i
can
legitimately
of
course
said
stormont
gravely
but
his
mind
was
full
of
the
jewels
which
eve
had
what
and
whose
were
they
if
quintana
again
had
the
esthonian
gems
in
his
possession
had
you
recovered
all
the
jewels
for
the
grand
duchess
he
asked
darragh
every
one
jack
quintana
has
done
me
a
terrible
injury
i
let
it
go
i
mean
to
hunt
that
man
to
the
end
stormont
terribly
perplexed
nodded
a
few
minutes
later
as
they
came
out
among
the
willows
and
alders
on
the
northeast
side
of
star
pond
stormont
touched
his
comrade
arm
look
at
that
enormous
out
there
in
the
lake
grab
those
dogs
they
strangle
each
other
cried
darragh
quickly
that
it
unleash
them
jack
and
let
them
go
he
was
struggling
with
the
other
two
couples
while
speaking
and
now
the
hounds
unleashed
lifted
frantic
voices
the
very
sky
seemed
full
of
the
discordant
tumult
wood
and
shore
reverberated
with
the
volume
of
convulsive
and
dissonant
baying
damn
it
said
darragh
disgusted
that
what
they
been
trailing
all
the
while
that
devilish
yonder
and
i
had
hoped
they
were
on
quintana
trail
a
mass
rush
and
scurry
of
crazed
dogs
nearly
swept
him
off
his
feet
and
both
men
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
large
taking
to
the
lake
from
a
ledge
of
rock
just
beyond
now
the
sky
vibrated
with
the
deafening
outcry
of
the
dogs
some
taking
to
water
others
racing
madly
along
shore
crack
the
echo
of
the
blow
on
the
water
came
across
to
them
as
the
beast
dived
well
i
in
for
it
now
muttered
darragh
starting
along
the
bank
toward
clinch
dump
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
dogs
stormont
followed
more
leisurely
iv
a
few
minutes
before
darragh
and
stormont
had
come
out
on
the
farther
edge
of
star
pond
sard
who
had
heard
from
quintana
about
the
big
drain
pipe
which
led
from
clinch
pantry
into
the
lake
decided
to
go
in
and
take
a
look
at
it
he
had
been
told
all
about
its
uses
how
clinch
in
the
event
of
a
raid
by
state
troopers
or
government
enforcement
agents
could
empty
his
contraband
hootch
into
the
lake
if
necessary
and
even
could
slide
a
barrel
of
ale
or
a
keg
of
rum
intact
into
the
great
tile
tunnel
and
recover
the
liquor
at
his
leisure
also
and
grimly
quintana
had
admitted
that
through
this
drain
eve
strayer
and
the
state
trooper
stormont
had
escaped
from
clinch
dump
so
now
sard
full
of
curiosity
went
back
into
the
pantry
to
look
at
it
for
himself
almost
instantly
the
idea
occurred
to
him
to
make
use
of
the
drain
for
his
own
safety
and
comfort
why
should
he
sleep
in
the
pantry
lock
the
door
and
in
case
of
intrusion
other
exits
being
unavailable
why
should
he
feel
entirely
safe
with
such
an
avenue
of
escape
open
for
swimming
was
sard
single
accomplishment
he
was
afraid
of
the
water
he
simply
could
sink
swimming
was
the
only
sport
he
ever
had
indulged
in
he
adored
it
also
the
mere
idea
of
sleeping
alone
amid
that
hell
of
trees
terrified
sard
never
had
he
known
such
horror
as
when
quintana
abandoned
him
in
the
woods
never
again
could
he
gaze
upon
a
tree
without
malignant
hatred
never
again
did
he
desire
to
lay
eyes
upon
even
a
bush
the
very
sight
now
of
the
dusky
forest
filled
him
with
loathing
why
should
he
not
risk
one
night
in
this
deserted
house
sleep
well
and
warmly
feed
well
drink
his
bellyfull
of
clinch
beer
before
attempting
the
southward
where
he
was
only
too
sure
that
patrols
were
riding
and
hiding
on
the
lookout
for
the
fancy
gentlemen
of
josé
selected
company
of
malefactors
well
here
in
the
snug
pantry
were
pies
crullers
bread
cheeses
various
dried
meats
tinned
vegetables
ham
bacon
fuel
and
range
to
prepare
what
he
desired
here
was
beer
too
and
doubtless
ardent
spirits
if
he
could
nose
out
the
hidden
demijohns
and
bottles
he
peered
out
of
the
pantry
window
at
the
forest
shuddered
cursed
it
and
every
separate
tree
in
it
cursed
quintana
too
wishing
him
black
mischance
no
it
was
settled
he
take
his
chance
here
in
the
pantry
and
there
must
be
a
mattress
somewhere
upstairs
he
climbed
the
staircase
cautiously
discovered
clinch
bedroom
took
the
mattress
and
blankets
from
the
bed
dragged
them
to
the
pantry
could
any
honest
man
be
more
tight
and
snug
in
this
perilous
world
of
the
desperate
and
undeserving
sard
thought
not
but
one
matter
troubled
him
the
lock
of
the
pantry
door
had
been
shattered
to
remedy
this
he
moused
around
until
he
discovered
some
long
nails
and
a
when
he
was
ready
to
go
to
sleep
he
nail
himself
in
and
in
the
morning
he
pry
the
door
loose
that
was
simple
sard
chuckled
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
set
eyes
upon
the
accursed
region
and
now
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
a
low
bank
of
solid
grey
cloud
and
fell
upon
the
countenance
of
emanuel
sard
it
warmed
his
agreeably
it
cheered
and
enlivened
him
not
for
him
a
night
of
terrors
in
that
horrible
forest
which
he
could
see
through
the
pantry
window
a
sense
of
security
and
of
pervaded
sard
to
his
muddy
shoes
he
even
curled
his
fat
toes
in
them
with
animal
contentment
a
little
snack
before
cooking
a
heavily
satisfactory
dinner
certainly
so
he
tucked
a
couple
of
bottles
of
beer
under
one
arm
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
chunk
of
cheese
under
the
other
and
waddled
out
to
the
veranda
door
and
at
that
instant
the
very
heavens
echoed
with
that
awful
tumult
which
had
first
paralysed
then
crazed
him
in
the
woods
bottles
bread
cheese
fell
from
his
grasp
and
his
knees
nearly
collapsed
under
him
in
the
bushes
on
the
lake
shore
he
saw
animals
leaping
and
racing
but
in
his
terror
he
did
not
recognise
them
for
dogs
then
suddenly
he
saw
a
man
close
to
the
house
running
and
another
man
not
far
behind
he
understood
and
it
electrified
him
into
action
it
was
too
late
to
escape
from
the
house
now
he
understood
that
instantly
he
ran
back
through
the
and
to
the
pantry
but
he
dared
not
let
these
intruders
hear
the
noise
of
hammering
in
an
agony
of
indecision
he
stood
trembling
listening
to
the
infernal
racket
of
the
dogs
and
waiting
for
the
first
footstep
within
the
house
no
step
came
but
chancing
to
look
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
a
man
peering
through
the
pantry
window
at
him
ungovernable
terror
seized
sard
scarcely
aware
what
he
was
about
he
seized
the
edges
of
the
big
and
crowded
his
obese
body
into
it
head
first
he
was
so
fat
and
heavy
that
he
filled
the
tile
to
start
himself
down
he
pulled
with
both
hands
and
kicked
himself
forward
down
the
slanting
tunnel
sticking
now
and
then
dragging
himself
on
and
downward
now
he
began
to
gain
momentum
he
felt
himself
sliding
not
fast
but
steadily
there
came
a
hitch
somewhere
his
heavy
body
stuck
on
the
steep
incline
then
as
he
lifted
his
bewildered
head
and
strove
to
peer
into
the
blackness
in
front
he
saw
four
balls
of
green
fire
close
to
him
in
darkness
he
began
to
slide
at
the
same
instant
and
flung
out
both
hands
to
check
himself
but
his
palms
slid
in
the
slime
and
his
body
slid
after
he
shrieked
once
as
his
face
struck
a
furry
obstruction
where
four
balls
of
green
fire
flamed
horribly
and
a
fury
of
murderous
teeth
tore
his
face
and
throat
to
bloody
tatters
as
he
slid
lower
lower
settling
through
waters
into
the
icy
depths
of
star
pond
stormont
down
by
the
lake
called
to
darragh
who
appeared
on
the
veranda
oh
jim
both
otters
crawled
into
the
drain
i
think
your
dogs
must
have
killed
one
of
them
under
water
there
a
big
patch
of
blood
spreading
off
shore
yes
said
darragh
something
has
just
been
killed
somewhere
jack
yes
pull
both
your
guns
and
come
up
here
quick
episode
ten
the
twilight
of
mike
i
when
quintana
turned
like
an
enraged
snake
on
sard
and
drove
him
to
his
destruction
he
would
have
killed
and
robbed
the
frightened
diamond
broker
had
he
dared
risk
the
shot
he
had
intended
to
do
this
anyway
sooner
or
later
but
with
the
noise
of
the
hunting
dogs
filling
the
forest
quintana
was
afraid
to
fire
yet
even
then
he
followed
sard
stealthily
for
a
few
minutes
afraid
yet
murderously
desirous
of
the
gems
confused
by
the
tumult
of
the
hounds
timid
and
ferocious
at
the
same
time
and
loath
to
leave
his
fat
perspiring
and
demoralised
victim
but
the
racket
of
the
dogs
proved
too
much
for
quintana
he
sheered
away
toward
the
south
leaving
sard
floundering
on
ahead
unconscious
of
the
treachery
that
had
followed
furtively
in
his
tracks
about
an
hour
later
quintana
was
seen
challenged
chased
and
shot
at
by
state
trooper
lannis
quintana
ran
and
what
with
the
dense
growth
of
seedling
beech
and
oak
and
the
heavily
falling
birch
and
poplar
leaves
lannis
first
lost
quintana
and
then
his
trail
the
state
trooper
had
left
his
horse
at
the
near
the
scene
of
darragh
masked
exploit
where
he
had
stopped
and
robbed
sard
and
now
lannis
hastened
back
to
find
and
mount
his
horse
and
gallop
straight
into
the
first
growth
timber
through
dim
aisles
of
giant
pine
he
spurred
to
a
dead
run
on
the
chance
of
cutting
quintana
from
the
eastward
edge
of
the
forest
and
forcing
him
back
toward
the
north
or
west
where
patrols
were
more
than
likely
to
hold
him
the
state
trooper
rode
with
all
the
reckless
indifference
and
grace
of
the
western
cavalryman
and
he
seemed
to
be
part
of
the
superb
animal
he
rode
part
of
its
bone
and
muscle
its
litheness
its
supple
power
part
of
its
vertebræ
and
ribs
and
limbs
so
perfect
was
their
bodily
rifle
and
eyes
intently
alert
the
rider
scarce
noticed
his
rushing
mount
and
if
he
guided
with
wrist
and
knee
it
was
instinctive
and
as
though
the
horse
were
guiding
them
both
and
now
far
ahead
through
this
primeval
stand
of
pine
sunshine
glimmered
warning
of
a
clearing
and
here
trooper
lannis
pulled
in
his
horse
at
the
edge
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
broad
flat
meadow
vividly
green
but
it
was
the
intense
arsenical
green
of
grass
that
covers
with
its
false
velvet
those
quaking
bogs
where
only
a
thin
skin
of
and
vegetation
cover
infinite
depths
of
silt
the
silt
had
no
more
substance
than
a
drop
of
ink
colouring
the
water
in
a
tumbler
sitting
his
mount
lannis
searched
this
wide
flat
expanse
of
brilliant
green
nothing
moved
on
it
save
a
great
heron
picking
its
deliberate
way
on
legs
it
was
well
for
quintana
that
he
had
not
attempted
it
very
cautiously
lannis
walked
his
horse
along
the
hard
ground
which
edged
this
marsh
on
the
west
nowhere
was
there
any
sign
that
quintana
had
come
down
to
the
edge
among
the
shrubs
and
swale
grasses
beyond
the
marsh
another
trooper
patrolled
and
when
at
length
he
and
lannis
perceived
each
other
and
exchanged
signals
the
latter
wheeled
his
horse
and
retraced
his
route
at
an
easy
canter
satisfied
that
quintana
had
not
yet
broken
cover
back
through
the
first
growth
he
cantered
his
rifle
at
a
ready
carefully
scanning
the
more
open
woodlands
and
so
came
again
to
the
and
here
stood
a
state
game
inspector
with
a
report
that
some
sort
of
was
hunting
in
the
forest
to
the
northwest
and
very
curious
to
investigate
so
it
was
arranged
that
the
inspector
should
turn
and
the
trooper
become
the
rover
there
was
no
sound
of
dogs
when
lannis
rode
in
on
the
narrow
spotted
trail
whence
he
had
flushed
quintana
into
the
dense
growth
of
saplings
that
bordered
it
his
horse
made
little
noise
on
the
moist
layer
of
leaves
and
forest
mould
he
listened
hard
for
the
sound
of
hounds
as
he
rode
heard
nothing
save
the
chirr
of
red
squirrels
the
shriek
of
a
watching
jay
or
the
startling
noise
of
falling
acorns
rapping
and
knocking
on
great
limbs
in
their
descent
to
the
forest
floor
once
very
very
far
away
westward
in
the
direction
of
star
pond
he
fancied
he
heard
a
faint
vibration
in
the
air
that
might
have
been
hounds
baying
he
was
right
and
at
that
very
moment
sard
was
dying
horribly
among
two
trapped
otters
as
big
and
fierce
as
the
dogs
that
had
driven
them
into
the
drain
but
lannis
knew
nothing
of
that
as
he
moved
on
mounted
along
the
spotted
trail
now
all
a
yellow
glory
of
birch
and
poplar
which
made
the
woodland
brilliant
as
though
lighted
by
yellow
lanterns
somewhere
among
the
birches
between
him
and
star
pond
was
harrod
place
and
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
quintana
might
have
ventured
to
ask
food
and
shelter
there
yet
that
was
not
likely
because
trooper
stormont
had
called
him
that
morning
on
the
telephone
from
the
hatchery
lodge
no
the
only
logical
retreat
for
quintana
was
northward
to
the
mountains
where
patrols
were
plenty
and
on
duty
in
every
or
the
fugitive
could
make
for
drowned
valley
by
a
blind
trail
which
stormont
informed
him
existed
but
which
lannis
never
had
heard
of
however
to
reassure
himself
lannis
rode
as
far
as
harrod
place
and
found
game
wardens
on
duty
along
the
line
then
he
turned
west
and
trotted
his
mount
down
to
the
hatchery
where
he
saw
ralph
wier
the
superintendent
standing
outside
the
lodge
talking
to
his
assistant
george
fry
when
lannis
rode
up
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
brook
he
called
across
to
wier
you
have
seen
anything
of
any
crooked
outfit
around
here
have
you
ralph
i
looking
for
that
kind
see
here
said
the
superintendent
i
do
know
but
george
fry
may
have
seen
one
of
your
guys
come
over
and
he
tell
you
what
happened
an
hour
ago
trooper
lannis
pivotted
his
horse
and
put
him
to
the
brook
with
scarcely
any
and
the
splendid
animal
cleared
the
water
like
a
deer
and
came
cantering
up
to
the
door
of
the
lodge
fry
boyish
face
seemed
agitated
he
looked
up
at
the
state
trooper
with
the
flush
of
tears
in
his
gaze
and
pointed
at
the
rifle
lannis
carried
if
i
had
he
said
excitedly
i
have
brought
in
a
crook
you
bet
where
did
you
see
him
inquired
lannis
jest
west
of
the
scaur
about
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
wier
and
me
was
stockin
the
head
of
scaur
brook
with
fingerlings
there
more
good
water
two
miles
of
it
to
the
east
and
all
it
needed
was
a
around
scaur
falls
so
i
toted
in
cement
and
sand
and
grub
last
week
and
i
built
me
a
shanty
on
the
scaur
and
i
been
laying
up
a
around
the
falls
so
that
how
i
come
there
he
clicked
his
teeth
and
darted
a
furious
glance
at
the
woods
by
god
he
said
i
was
such
a
fool
i
did
take
no
rifle
all
i
had
was
an
axe
and
a
few
traps
i
going
to
let
the
mink
get
our
trout
whatever
you
fellows
say
he
added
defiantly
and
law
or
no
law
get
along
with
your
story
young
man
interrupted
lannis
you
can
spill
the
rest
out
to
the
commissioner
all
right
then
this
is
the
way
it
happened
down
to
the
scaur
i
was
eating
lunch
by
the
looking
up
at
and
kind
of
planning
how
to
save
cement
and
not
thinking
about
anybody
being
near
me
when
made
me
turn
my
head
you
know
how
it
is
in
the
woods
i
kinda
somebody
near
and
by
cracky
there
stood
a
man
with
a
big
black
automatic
pistol
and
he
had
a
bead
on
my
belly
said
i
troubling
and
your
gun
my
friend
i
was
that
astonished
he
was
a
powerful
guy
with
a
foreign
face
and
voice
and
way
he
wanted
to
know
if
he
had
the
honour
as
he
put
it
to
introduce
himself
to
a
detective
or
game
constable
or
a
friend
of
mike
clinch
i
told
him
i
was
any
of
these
and
that
i
worked
in
a
private
hatchery
and
he
called
me
a
liar
young
fry
face
flushed
and
his
voice
began
to
quiver
that
the
way
he
misused
me
and
he
backed
me
into
the
shanty
and
i
had
to
sit
down
with
both
hands
up
then
he
filled
my
with
grub
and
took
my
axe
and
strapped
my
kit
onto
his
back
and
talking
all
the
time
in
his
mean
sneery
foreign
way
and
i
guess
he
thought
he
was
funny
for
he
laughed
at
his
own
jokes
he
told
me
his
name
was
quintana
and
that
he
ought
to
shoot
me
for
a
rat
but
would
because
of
the
stink
then
he
said
he
was
going
to
do
a
quick
job
that
the
police
were
too
cowardly
to
do
that
he
was
to
find
mike
clinch
down
to
drowned
valley
and
kill
him
and
if
he
could
catch
mike
daughter
too
he
spoil
her
face
for
life
the
boy
was
breathing
so
hard
and
his
rage
made
him
so
incoherent
that
lannis
took
him
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
what
next
demanded
the
trooper
impatiently
tell
your
story
and
quit
thinking
how
you
were
misused
he
told
me
to
stay
in
the
shanty
for
an
hour
or
he
do
for
me
good
cried
fry
once
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
and
there
he
stood
by
the
brook
wolfing
my
lunch
with
both
hands
i
tell
you
he
cursed
and
drove
me
like
a
dog
inside
with
his
big
pistol
my
god
like
a
dog
then
the
next
time
i
took
a
chance
he
was
gone
and
i
beat
it
here
to
get
me
a
rifle
the
boy
broke
down
and
sobbed
he
drove
me
around
like
a
dog
he
did
you
leave
that
to
me
interrupted
lannis
sharply
and
to
wier
you
and
george
had
better
get
a
gun
apiece
that
fellow
come
back
here
or
go
to
harrod
place

him
out
wier
said
to

up
to

place
and
tell
jansen
your
story
and
bring

and
quit
snivelling
you
may
get
a
shot
at
him
yet
lannis
had
already
ridden
down
to
the
brook
now
he
jumped
his
horse
across

up
called

cantered
into
the
north
behind
the
curtains
of
her
open
window

on
her
bed

hot
face
and

repeated
impatiently

to

asked
the
bewildered

at
the
same
moment
the
girl
eyes
fell
on
a
pile
of
men
sporting
clothing
garments
sent
down
from
harrod
place
to
the
lodge
lying
on
a
leather
lounge

heavy
pairs
of

she
was

and

coolly

change
she
said
we
no
swindlers
at
dump
wier
started
forward
as
though
to
intercept
her
eve
eyes
flamed
and
he
stood
still
she
wrenched
open
the
door
and
walked
out
among
the
silver
birches
at
the
edge
of
the
brook
she
stood
a
moment
coolly
loading
the
magazine
of
her
rifle
then
with
one
swift
glance
of
hatred
flung
at
the
place
that
harrod
money
had
built
she
sprang
across
the
brook
tossed
her
rifle
to
her
shoulder
and
passed
lithely
into
the
golden
wilderness
of
poplar
and
silver
birch
ii
quintana
on
a
along
the
into
drowned
valley
now
thoroughly
understood
that
it
was
the
only
sanctuary
left
him
for
the
moment
egress
to
the
southward
was
closed
to
the
eastward
also
and
he
was
too
wary
to
venture
westward
toward
ghost
lake
no
the
only
temporary
safety
lay
in
the
swamps
of
drowned
valley
and
there
he
decided
as
he
jogged
along
if
worse
came
to
worst
and
starvation
drove
him
out
he
settle
matters
with
mike
clinch
and
break
through
to
the
north
he
meant
to
settle
matters
with
mike
clinch
anyway
he
was
not
afraid
of
clinch
not
really
afraid
of
anybody
it
had
been
the
dogs
that
demoralised
quintana
he
had
no
experience
with
hunting
hounds
did
not
know
what
to
expect
how
to
manoeuvre
if
only
he
could
have
these
beasts
that
filled
the
forest
with
their
outcries
if
he
could
have
had
a
good
look
at
the
creatures
who
gave
forth
that
weird
crazed
melancholy
volume
of
sound
bon
he
said
coolly
to
himself
it
was
a
crisis
of
nerves
which
i
experience
yes
i
should
have
shot
him
that
fat
sard
yes
only
those
damn
dog
and
now
he
shall
die
an
rot
that
fat
sard
all
by
parbleu
like
one
big
dead
thing
all
alone
in
the
wood
a
puddle
of
guts
full
of
diamonds
ah
mon
dieu
a
million
francs
in
gems
that
shine
like
festering
stars
in
this
damn
wood
till
the
world
end
ah
bah
nome
de
dieu
de
halte
là
came
a
sharp
voice
from
the
cedar
fringe
in
front
a
pause
then
recognition
and
henri
picquet
walked
out
on
the
hard
ridge
beyond
and
stood
leaning
on
his
rifle
and
looking
sullenly
at
his
leader
quintana
came
forward
carelessly
a
disagreeable
expression
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
narrow
lips
and
continued
on
past
picquet
the
latter
slouched
after
his
leader
who
had
walked
over
to
the
before
which
a
pile
of
charred
logs
lay
in
cold
ashes
as
picquet
came
up
quintana
turned
on
him
with
a
gesture
toward
the
extinguished
fire
it
is
cold
like
hell
he
said
why
do
you
not
have
some
fire
not
for
me
non
growled
picquet
and
jerked
a
dirty
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
and
there
quintana
saw
a
pair
of
muddy
boots
protruding
from
a
blanket
it
is
harry
beck
yes
he
inquired
then
about
the
boots
and
the
blanket
silenced
him
he
kept
his
eyes
on
them
for
a
full
minute
then
walked
into
the
the
blanket
also
covered
harry
beck
features
and
there
was
a
stain
on
it
where
it
outlined
the
prostrate
man
features
making
a
ridge
over
the
bony
nose
after
a
moment
quintana
looked
around
at
picquet
so
he
is
dead
yes
picquet
shrugged
since
noon

and
come
the
big
bullets
of

and
his
voyous

and
like
a
beef
that
dies
the
air
bellows
out
from
his
big
lungs
picquet
looked
down
at
the
dead
comrade
in
a
sort
of
weary
compassion
for
such
so
he
pass
this
goddam
johnbull

there
je

then
i
put
out

fire
and
leave
quintana
let
his
sneering
glance
rest
on
the
dead
a
moment
and
his
thin
lip
curled
immemorial
contempt
for
the
then
he
divested
himself
of
the
which
he
had
stolen
from
the
fry
boy
alors
he
said
calmly
it
has
been
mike
clinch
who
shoot
my
beck
bien
he
threw
a
cartridge
into
the
breech
of
his
rifle
adjusted
his
ammunition
belt
carelessly
then
in
a
quiet
voice
my
frien
picquet
the
time

when
it
become
ver
necessary
that
we
go
from
here
away
donc

my
frien
mike
clinch
picquet
unastonished
gave
him
a
heavy
bovine
look
of
inquiry
quintana
said
softly
me
i
have
enough
already
of
this
damn
woods
why
shall
we
starve
here
when
there
lies
our
path
he
pointed
north
his
arm
remained
outstretched
for
a
while
clinch
he
is
there
growled
picquet
also
our
path
henri
and
behind
us
they
hunt

now
with
picquet
bared
his
big
white
teeth
in
fierce
surprise
dogs
he
repeated
with
a
sort
of
snarl
that
is
how
they
now
hunt
us
my
frien
like
they
hunt
the
hare
in
the
côte
me
i
shall
now
reconnoitre
way
and
he
looked
where
he
was
pointing
into
the
north
with
smouldering
eyes
then
he
turned
calmly
to
picquet
an
you
at
orders
mon
capitaine
bien
venez
they
walked
leisurely
forward
with
rifles
shouldered
following
the
hard
ridge
out
across
a
vast
and
flooded
land
where
the
bark
of
trees
glimmered
with
wet
mosses
after
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
ridge
broadened
and
split
into
two
one
branching
northeast
they
however
continued
north
about
twenty
minutes
later
picquet
creeping
along
on
quintana
left
and
some
sixty
yards
distant
discovered
something
moving
in
the
woods
beyond
and
fired
at
it
instantly
two
unseen
rifles
spoke
from
the
woods
ahead
picquet
was
jerked
clear
around
lost
his
balance
and
nearly
fell
blood
was
spurting
from
his
right
arm
between
elbow
and
shoulder
he
tried
to
lift
and
level
his
rifle
his
arm
collapsed
and
dangled
broken
and
powerless
his
rifle
clattered
to
the
forest
floor
for
a
moment
he
stood
there
in
plain
view
dumb
deathly
white
then
he
began
screaming
with
fury
while
the
big
bullets
came
streaming
in
all
around
him
his
broken
arm
was
hit
again
his
screaming
ceased
he
dragged
out
his
big
with
his
left
hand
and
started
running
toward
the
shooting
as
he
ran
his
mangled
arm
flopping
like
a
broken
wing
byron
hastings
stepped
out
from
behind
a
tree
and
coolly
shot
him
down
at
close
quarters
then
quintana
rifle
exploded
twice
very
quickly
and
the
hastings
boy
stumbled
sideways
and
fell
sprawling
he
managed
to
rise
to
his
knees
again
he
even
was
trying
to
stand
up
when
quintana
taking
his
time
deliberately
began
to
empty
his
magazine
into
the
boy
riddling
him
limb
and
body
and
head
down
once
more
he
still
moved
his
arms
sid
hone
reached
out
from
behind
a
fallen
log
to
grasp
the
dying
lad
ankle
and
draw
him
into
shelter
but
quintana
reloaded
swiftly
and
smashed
hone
left
hand
with
the
first
shot
then
jim
hastings
kneeling
behind
a
bunch
of
juniper
fired
a
bullet
into
the
tree
behind
which
quintana
stood
but
before
he
could
fire
again
quintana
shot
in
reply
came
ripping
through
the
juniper
and
tore
a
ghastly
hole
in
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
striking
a
blow
that
knocked
young
hastings
flat
and
paralysed
as
a
dead
flounder
a
mile
to
the
north
blocking
the
other
exit
from

valley

agreeable
voice

the
shooting

clinch
nostrils
expanded
and
flattened
with
every
breath

stood
glaring
into
the
woods

heavily

their
feet
made
little
noise
on
the
moss

came
over
and
stood
near
clinch
for
ten
minutes
neither
man
moved
clinch
stared
at
the
woods
in
front
of
him
the
younger
nervous
glance
flickered
like
a
snake
tongue
in
every
direction
and
he
kept
moistening
his
lips
with
his
tongue
presently
two
shots
came
from
the
south
a
pause
a
rattle
of
shots
from
hastily
emptied
magazines
down

to

carrying
his
rifle
at
a
trail
for
half
an
hour
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
forests
of
drowned
valley
except
in
the
dead
timber
where
unseen
woodpeckers
hammered
fitfully
at
the
ghosts
of
ancient
trees
always
clinch
little
pale
eyes
searched
the
forest
twilight
in
front
of
him
not
a
falling
leaf
escaped
him
not
a
chipmunk

blommers

again
and
bade

began
to
sob
that

did
want

left
out
there
all
alone
but
chase
promised
to
come
back

dead

silence
be

she
turned
with
a
heavy
heart
to
the
home

her
mind
was
passionately
with

in
the
spectral
forests
of
drowned
valley
iii
and
clinch
mind
was
on
her
all

his
watchfulness
his
stealthy
advance
all
the
alertness
of
eye
and
ear
all
the
subtlety
the
cunning
the
infinite
caution
were
purely
instinctive
mechanics
somewhere
in
this
flooded
twilight
of
gigantic
trees
was
josé
quintana
knowing
that
he
dismissed
that
fact
from
his
mind
and
turned
his
thoughts
to
eve
sometimes
his
lips
moved
they
usually
did
when
he
was
arguing
with
god
or
calling
his
creator
attention
to
the
justice
of
his
case
his
cases
each
to
him
a
cause
célèbre
the
matter
of
harrod
the
affair
of
quintana
many
a
time
he
had
pleaded
these
two
causes
before
the
most
high
but
now
his
thoughts
were
chiefly
concerned
with
eve
with
the
problem
of
her
future
his
master
passion
this
daughter
of
the
dead
wife
he
had
loved
he
sighed
unconsciously
halted
well
lord
he
concluded
in
his
wordless
way

at
that
instant
he
saw
quintana
recognition
was
instant
and
mutual
neither
man
stirred
quintana
was
standing
beside
a
giant
hemlock
his
pack
lay
at
his
feet
clinch
had
halted
always
the
mechanics
close
to
a
great
ironwood
tree
probably
both
men
knew
that
they
could
cover
themselves
before
the
other
moved
a
muscle
clinch
small
light
eyes
were
blazing
black
eyes
had
become
two
slits

trees

in
the
ferocious
pride
of
woodcraft
laughed

the
dim
and
spectral
forest

frien
mike
said
quintana
cautiously
clinch
took
his
rifle
by
the
muzzle
and
shoved
the
stock
into
view
so
that
quintana
could
see
it
without
moving
to
his
surprise
quintana
did
the
same
then
coolly
stepped
a
pace
outside
the
shelter
of
his
hemlock
stump
you
show
me
now
he
called
across
the
swamp
clinch
stepped
into
view
dug
into
his
pocket
and
cupping
both
hands
displayed
a
glittering
heap
of
gems
i
wanted
you
should
know
who
gottem
he
said
before
you
hop
give
you
something
to
think
over
in
hell
quintana
eyes
had
become
slits
again
neither
man
stirred
then
so

buzzard
eh
clinch

feed
on
dead
man
pockets
eh

sard
somewhere
an
you

he
held
up
the
morocco
case
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
the
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
and
shook
it
at
clinch
in
there
is
my
share
not
all
ver
quick
now
i
take
yours
too
clinch
vanished
and
so
did
his
rifle
and
quintana
first
bullet
struck
the
moss
where
the
stock
had
rested
you
black
crow
jeered
clinch
laughing
i
need
that
empty
case
of
yours
and
i
going
after
it
but
it
because
your
filthy
claw
touched
my
girlie
that
you
got
ta
hop
twilight
lay
over
the
phantom
wood
touching
with
pallid
tints
the
flooded
forest
so
far
only
that
one
shot
had
been
fired
both
men
were
still
manoeuvring
always
creeping
in
circles
and
always
lining
some
great
tree
for
shelter
now
the
gathering
dusk
was
making
them
bolder
and
swifter
and
twice
already
clinch
caught
the
shadow
of
a
fading
edge
of
something
that
vanished
against
the
shadows
too
swiftly
for
a
shot
now
quintana
keeping
a
tree
in
line
brushed
with
his
lithe
back
a
leafless
that
stood
swaying
as
he
avoided
it
instantly
a
stealthy
hope
seized
him
he
slipped
out
of
his
coat
spread
it
on
the
bush
set
the
naked
branches
swaying
and
darted
to
his
tree
waiting
he
saw
that
the
grey
blot
his
coat
made
in
the
dusk
was
still
moving
a
little
just
vibrating
a
little
bit
in
the
twilight
he
touched
the
bush
with
his
rifle
barrel
then
crouched
almost
flat
suddenly
the
red
crash
of
a
rifle
lit
up
clinch
visage
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
quintana
bullet
smashed
clinch
between
the
eyes
after
a
long
while
quintana
ventured
to
rise
and
creep
forward
night
too
came
creeping
like
an
assassin
amid
the
ghostly
trees
so
twilight
died
in
the
stillness
of
drowned
valley
and
the
pall
of
night
lay
over
all
things
living
and
dead
alike
episode
eleven
the
place
of
pines
i
the
last
sound
that
mike
clinch
heard
on
earth
was
the
detonation
of
his
own
rifle
probably
it
was
an
agreeable
sound
to
him
he
lay
there
with
a
pleasant
expression
on
his
massive
features
his
watch
had
fallen
out
of
his
pocket
quintana
shined
him
with
an
electric
torch
picked
up
the
watch
then
holding
the
torch
in
one
hand
he
went
through
the
dead
man
pockets
very
thoroughly
when
quintana
had
finished
both
trays
of
the
flat
morocco
case
were
full
of
jewels
and
quintana
was
full
of
wonder
and
suspicion
unquietly
he
looked
upon
the
dead
upon
the
glittering
contents
of
the
but
always
his
gaze
reverted
to
the
dead
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
edged
clinch
lips
quintana
lips
grew
graver
he
said
slowly
like
one
who
does
his
thinking
aloud
what
is
it
you
have
done
to
me
clinch
are
there
truly
then
two
sets
of
precious
stones
flaming
jewels
two
gems
of
erosite
like

so
ver
funny
like
you
are
amuse
i
am
wondering
what
you
may
have
done
to
me
my
frien
clinch
for
a
while
he
remained
kneeling
beside
the
dead
then
ah
bah
he
said
pocketing
the
morocco
case
and
getting
to
his
feet
he
moved
a
little
way
toward
the
open
trail
stopped
came
back
stood
his
rifle
against
a
tree
for
a
while
he
was
busy
with
his
sharp
spanish
clasp
knife
whittling
and
fitting
together
two
peeled
twigs
a
cross
was
the
ultimate
result
then
he
placed
clinch
hands
palm
to
palm
upon
his
chest
laid
the
cross
on
his
breast
and
shined
the
result
with
complacency
then
quintana
took
off
his
hat
mike
he
said
you
were
a
adios
quintana
put
on
his
hat
the
path
was
free
the
world
lay
open
before
josé
quintana
once
more
the
world
his
hunting
ground
but
he
thought
uneasily
what
is
it
that
i
bring
home
this
time
how
much
is
paste
my
god
how
droll
that
smile
of
clinch
which
is
the
false
his
jewels
or
mine
dieu
que
bête

who
have
not
suspec
that
there
are
trays
within
my
i
unnerstan
it
is
ver
simple
in
the
top
tray
the
false
gems
ah
paste
on
top
to
deceive
a
thief
alors
then
what
i
have
recover
of
clinch
is
the
nom
de
dieu
how
should
i
know
his
smile
is
so
ver
funny
i
think
thees
dead
man
make
mock
of
me
all
inside
so
in
darkness
prowling
south
by
west
shining
the
trail
furtively
and
loaded
rifle
ready
quintana
moved
with
stealthy
unhurried
tread
out
of
the
wilderness
that
had
trapped
him
and
toward
the
tangled
border
of
that
outer
world
which
led
to
safe
obscure
uncharted
labyrinths
mazes
immemorial
hunting
grounds
haunted
by
men
who
prey
the
night
had
turned
frosty
quintana
wet
to
the
knees
and
very
tired
moved
slowly
not
daring
to
leave
the
trail
because
of
however
the
trail
led
to
clinch
dump
and
sooner
or
later
he
must
leave
it
what
he
had
to
have
was
a
fire
he
realised
that
somewhere
off
the
trail
in
big
timber
if
possible
he
must
build
a
fire
and
master
this
deadly
chill
that
was
slowly
paralysing
all
power
of
movement
he
knew
that
a
fire
in
the
forest
particularly
in
big
timber
could
be
seen
only
a
little
way
he
must
take
his
chances
with
and
find
some
spot
in
the
forest
to
build
that
fire
who
could
discover
him
except
by
accident
who
would
prowl
the
midnight
wilderness
at
thirty
yards
the
fire
would
not
be
visible
and
as
for
the
odour
well
he
be
gone
before
dawn
meanwhile
he
must
have
that
fire
he
could
wait
no
longer
he
cut
a
pole
first
then
he
left
the
trail
where
a
little
spring
flowed
west
and
turned
to
the
right
shining
the
forest
floor
as
he
moved
and
sounding
with
his
pole
every
wet
stretch
of
moss
every
strip
of
mud
every
tiniest
glimmer
of
water
at
last
he
came
to
a
place
of
pines
first
growth
giants
towering
into
night
and
looking
up
saw
stars
infinitely
distant
where
perhaps
those
things
called
souls
drifted
like
wisps
of
vapour
when
the
fire
took
quintana
thin
dark
hands
had
become
nearly
useless
from
cold
he
could
not
have
crooked
finger
to
trigger
for
a
long
time
he
sat
close
to
the
blaze
slowly
massaging
his
torpid
limbs
but
did
not
dare
strip
off
his
steam
rose
from
puttee
and
heavy
shoe
and
from
the
sodden
woollen
breeches
warmth
slowly
penetrated
there
was
little
smoke
the
big
dry
branches
were
dead
and
bleached
and
he
let
the
fire
eat
into
them
without
using
his
axe
once
or
twice
he
sighed
oh
my
god
in
a
weary
as
though
the
content
of
were
permeating
him
later
he
ate
and
drank
languidly
looking
up
at
the
stars
speculating
as
to
the
possible
presence
of
mike
clinch
up
there
ah
the
dirty
thief
he
murmured
nevertheless
a
man
quel
homme
mais
bête
à
faire
pleurer
je
bien
triché
moi
ha
quintana
smiled
palely
as
he
thought
of
the
coat
and
the
bush
of
the
red
glare
of
clinch
shot
of
the
of
his
own
shot
then
uneasy
he
drew
out
the
morocco
case
and
gazed
at
the
two
trays
full
of
gems
the
jewels
blazed
in
the
firelight
he
touched
them
moved
them
about
picked
up
several
and
examined
them
testing
the
unset
edges
against
his
under
lip
as
an
expert
tests
jade
but
he
could
tell
there
was
no
knowing
he
replaced
them
closed
the
case
pocketed
it
when
he
had
a
chance
he
could
try
boiling
water
for
one
sort
of
trick
he
could
scratch
one
or
two
sard
would
know
he
wondered
whether
sard
had
got
away
not
concerned
except
selfishly
however
there
were
others
in
paris
whom
he
could
trust
at
a
price
quintana
rested
both
elbows
on
his
knees
and
framed
his
dark
face
between
both
bony
hands
what
a
chase
clinch
had
led
him
after
the
flaming
jewel
and
now
clinch
lay
dead
in
the
forest
faintly
smiling
at
in
a
very
low
passionless
voice
quintana
cursed
monotonously
as
he
gazed
into
the
fire
in
spanish
french
portuguese
italian
he
cursed
clinch
after
a
little
while
he
remembered
clinch
daughter
and
he
cursed
her
elaborately
thoroughly
wishing
her
black
mischance
awake
and
asleep
living
or
dead
darragh
too
he
remembered
in
his
curses
and
did
not
slight
him
and
the
trooper
stormont
ah
he
should
have
killed
all
of
them
when
he
had
the
chance
and
those
two
baltic
russians
also
the
girl
duchess
and
her
friend
why
on
earth
had
he
made
a
clean
job
of
it
a
wary
disinclination
to
stir
up
civilization
by
needless
murder
but
after
all
old
maxims
old
beliefs
old
truths
are
the
best
god
knows
the
dead
do
talk
and
that
the
wisest
wisdom
of
all
if
murmured
quintana
fervently
god
gives
me
further
opportunity
to
acquire
a
little
property
to
comfort
me
in
my
old
age
i
shall
leave
no
gossiping
fool
to
do
me
harm
with
his
tongue
no
i
kill
and
though
they
raise
a
hue
and
cry
dead
tongues
can
not
wag
and
i
save
much
annoyance
in
the
end
he
leaned
his
back
against
the
trunk
of
a
massive
pine
presently
quintana
slept
after
his
own
fashion
that
is
to
say
looking
closely
at
him
one
could
discover
a
glimmer
under
his
lowered
eyelids
and
he
listened
always
in
that
kind
of
sleep
as
though
a
shadowy
part
of
him
were
detached
from
his
body
and
mounted
guard
over
it
the
inaudible
movement
of
a
venturing
into
the
firelit
circle
awoke
quintana
again
a
dropping
leaf
amid
distant
birches
awoke
him
such
things
and
so
he
slept
with
wet
feet
to
the
fire
and
his
rifle
across
his
knees
and
dreamed
of
eve
and
of
murder
and
that
the
flaming
jewel
was
but
a
mass
of
glass
at
that
moment
the
girl
of
whose
white
throat
quintana
was
dreaming
and
whining
faintly
in
his
dreams
stood
alone
outside
clinch
dump
rifle
in
hand
listening
fighting
the
creeping
dread
that
touched
her
slender
body
at
times
seemed
to
touch
her
very
heart
with
frost
clinch
men
had
gone
on
to
ghost
lake
with
their
wounded
and
dead
where
there
was
fitter
shelter
for
both
all
had
gone
on
nobody
remained
to
await
clinch
except
eve
strayer
black
care
that
tireless
squire
of
dames
had
followed
her
from
the
time
she
had
left
clinch
facing
the
spectral
forests
of
drowned
valley
an
odd
unusual
dread
weighted
her
heart
something
in
emotions
that
she
never
before
had
experienced
in
time
of
danger
in
it
there
was
the
deathly
unease
of
premonition
but
of
what
it
was
born
she
did
not
understand
perhaps
of
the
strain
of
dangers
passed
of
the
shock
of
discovery
concerning
smith
identity
with
darragh
darragh
the
hated
kinsman
of
harrod
the
abhorred
fiercely
she
wondered
how
much
her
lover
knew
about
this
miserable
masquerade
was
stormont
involved
in
this
deception
stormont
the
object
of
her
first
girl
passion
stormont
for
whom
she
would
have
died
wretched
perplexed
fiercely
enraged
at
darragh
deadly
anxious
concerning
clinch
she
had
gone
about
cooking
supper
the
supper
kept
warm
on
the
range
still
awaited
the
man
who
had
no
more
need
of
meat
and
drink
of
the
tragedy
of
sard
eve
knew
nothing
there
were
no
traces
save
in
the
disorder
in
the
pantry
and
the
bottles
and
chair
on
the
veranda
who
had
visited
the
place
excepting
those
from
whom
she
and
stormont
had
fled
did
not
appear
she
had
no
idea
why
her
mattress
and
lay
in
the
pantry
her
heart
heavy
with
ceaseless
anxiety
eve
carried
mattress
and
to
clinch
chamber
his
bed
wandered
through
the
house
setting
it
in
order
then
in
the
kitchen
seated
herself
and
waited
until
the
strange
dread
that
possessed
her
drove
her
out
into
the
starlight
to
stand
and
listen
and
stare
at
the
dark
forest
where
all
her
dread
seemed
concentrated
it
was
not
yet
dawn
but
the
girl
could
endure
the
strain
no
longer
with
electric
torch
and
rifle
she
started
for
the
forest
almost
running
at
first
then
among
the
first
trees
moving
with
caution
and
in
silence
along
the
trail
over
which
clinch
should
long
since
have
journeyed
homeward
in
soft
places
when
she
ventured
to
flash
her
torch
cast
curious
shadows
and
it
was
hard
to
make
out
tracks
so
oddly
distorted
by
the
light
prints
mingled
and
partly
obliterated
other
prints
she
identified
her
own
tracks
leading
south
and
guessed
at
the
others
pointing
north
and
south
where
they
had
carried
in
the
wounded
and
had
gone
back
to
bring
in
the
dead
but
nowhere
could
she
discover
any
impression
resembling
her
that
great
firm
stride
and
solid
imprint
which
so
often
she
had
tracked
through
moss
and
swale
and
which
she
knew
so
well
once
when
she
got
up
from
her
knees
after
close
examination
of
the
muddy
trail
she
became
aware
of
the
slightest
taint
in
the
night
air
stood
with
delicate
nostrils
quivering
advanced
still
conscious
of
the
taint
listening
wary
every
stealthy
instinct
alert
she
had
not
been
mistaken
somewhere
in
the
forest
there
was
smoke
somewhere
a
fire
was
burning
it
might
not
be
very
far
away
it
might
be
distant
fire
her
father
would
a
hunter
of
men
build
a
fire
the
girl
stood
shivering
in
the
darkness
there
was
not
a
sound
now
keeping
her
cautious
feet
in
the
trail
by
sense
of
touch
alone
she
moved
on
gradually
as
she
advanced
the
odour
of
smoke
became
more
distinct
she
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
but
there
was
a
near
reek
of
smoke
in
her
nostrils
and
she
stopped
short
after
a
little
while
in
the
intense
silence
of
the
forest
she
ventured
to
touch
the
switch
of
her
torch
very
cautiously
in
the
faint
pale
lustre
she
saw
a
tiny
rivulet
flowing
westward
from
a
spring
and
beside
it
in
the
mud
imprints
of
a
man
feet
the
tracks
were
small
narrow
slimmer
than
imprints
made
by
any
man
she
could
think
of
under
the
glimmer
of
her
torch
they
seemed
quite
fresh
contours
were
still
sharp
some
ready
to
crumble
and
water
stood
in
the
heels
a
little
way
she
traced
them
saw
where
their
maker
had
cut
a
pole
peeled
it
saw
farther
on
where
this
unknown
man
had
probed
in
moss
and
mud
peppered
some
particularly
suspicious
swale
with
a
series
of
holes
as
though
a
giant
woodcock
had
been
boring
there
who
was
this
man
wandering
all
alone
at
night
off
the
drowned
valley
trail
and
probing
the
darkness
with
a
pole
she
knew
it
was
not
her
father
she
knew
that
no
native
none
of
her
father
men
would
behave
in
such
a
manner
nor
could
any
of
these
have
left
such
narrow
almost
delicate
tracks
as
she
stole
along
dimly
shining
the
tracks
lifting
her
head
incessantly
to
listen
and
peer
into
the
darkness
her
quick
eye
caught
something
ahead
something
very
slightly
different
from
the
wall
of
black
obscurity
a
vague
hint
of
colour
the
very
vaguest
tint
scarcely
perceptible
at
all
but
she
knew
it
was
firelight
touching
the
trunk
of
an
unseen
tree
now
soundlessly
over
damp
pine
needles
she
crept
the
scent
of
smoke
grew
strong
in
nostril
and
throat
the
pale
tint
became
palely
reddish
all
about
her
the
blackness
seemed
palpable
seemed
to
touch
her
body
with
its
weight
but
ahead
a
ruddy
glow
stained
two
huge
pines
and
presently
she
saw
the
fire
burning
low
but
redly
alive
and
after
a
long
long
while
she
saw
a
man
he
had
left
the
fire
circle
his
pack
and
belted
mackinaw
still
lay
there
at
the
foot
of
a
great
tree
but
when
finally
she
discovered
him
he
was
scarcely
visible
where
he
crouched
in
the
shadow
of
a
with
his
rifle
half
lowered
at
a
ready
had
he
heard
her
it
did
not
seem
possible
had
he
been
crouching
there
since
he
made
his
fire
why
had
he
made
it
then
for
its
warmth
could
not
reach
him
there
and
why
was
he
so
stealthily
watching
silent
unstirring
crouched
in
the
shadows
she
strained
her
eyes
but
distance
and
obscurity
made
recognition
impossible
and
yet
somehow
every
quivering
instinct
within
her
was
telling
her
that
the
crouched
and
shadowy
watcher
beyond
the
fire
was
quintana
and
every
concentrated
instinct
was
telling
her
that
he
kill
her
if
he
caught
sight
of
her
her
heart
clamoured
it
her
pulses
thumped
it
in
her
ears
had
the
girl
been
capable
of
it
she
could
have
killed
him
where
he
crouched
she
thought
of
it
but
knew
it
was
not
in
her
to
do
it
and
yet
quintana
had
boasted
that
he
meant
to
kill
her
father
that
was
what
terribly
concerned
her
and
there
must
be
a
way
to
stop
that
danger
some
way
to
stop
it
short
of
murder
a
way
to
render
this
man
harmless
to
her
and
hers
no
she
could
not
kill
him
this
way
except
in
extremes
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
fire
upon
any
human
creature
and
yet
this
man
must
be
rendered
harmless
somehow
somehow
ah
as
the
problem
presented
itself
its
solution
flashed
into
her
mind
men
of
the
wilderness
knew
how
to
take
dangerous
creatures
alive
to
take
a
dangerous
and
reasoning
human
was
even
less
difficult
because
reason
makes
more
mistakes
than
does
instinct
stealthily
without
a
sound
the
girl
crept
back
through
the
shadows
over
the
damp
pine
needles
until
peering
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
she
saw
the
last
of
quintana
fire
die
out
in
the
terrific
dark
behind
slowly
still
she
moved
until
her
sensitive
feet
felt
the
trodden
path
from
drowned
valley
now
with
torch
flaring
she
ran
carrying
her
rifle
at
a
trail
before
her
here
and
there
little
night
creatures
fled
a
raccoon
dazzled
by
the
glare
a
barred
owl
still
struggling
with
its
kill
she
ran
easily
an
agile
tireless
young
thing
part
of
the
swiftness
and
silence
of
the
woods
part
of
the
darkness
the
sinuous
celerity
the
ominous
hush
of
wide
still
places
part
of
its
very
blood
and
pulse
and
hot
sweet
breath
even
when
she
came
out
among
the
birches
by
clinch
dump
she
was
breathing
evenly
and
without
distress
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
door
but
did
not
enter
on
pegs
under
the
porch
a
score
or
more
of
rusty
traps
hung
she
unhooked
the
largest
wound
the
chain
around
it
tucked
it
under
her
left
arm
and
started
back
when
at
last
she
arrived
at
the
place
of
pines
again
and
saw
the
far
spectral
glimmer
of
quintana
fire
the
girl
was
almost
breathless
but
dawn
was
not
very
far
away
and
there
remained
little
time
for
the
taking
alive
of
a
dangerous
man
where
two
enormous
pines
grew
close
together
near
a
sapling
she
knelt
down
and
with
both
hands
scooped
out
a
big
hollow
in
the
immemorial
layers
of
pine
needles
here
she
placed
her
trap
it
took
all
her
strength
and
skill
to
set
it
to
fasten
the
chain
around
the
base
of
the
sapling
pine
and
now
working
with
only
the
faintest
glimmer
of
her
torch
she
covered
everything
with
pine
needles
it
was
not
possible
to
restore
the
forest
floor
the
place
remained
visible
a
darker
rougher
patch
on
the
bronzed
carpet
of
needles
beaten
smooth
by
decades
of
rain
and
snow
no
animal
would
have
trodden
that
suspicious
space
but
it
was
with
man
she
had
to
deal
a
dangerous
but
reasoning
man
with
few
and
atrophied
instincts
and
with
no
experience
in
traps
and
therefore
in
no
dread
of
them
before
she
started
she
had
thrown
a
cartridge
into
the
breech
of
her
rifle
now
she
pocketed
her
torch
and
seated
herself
between
the
two
big
pines
and
about
three
feet
behind
the
hidden
trap
dawn
was
not
far
away
she
looked
upward
through
high
where
stars
shone
and
saw
no
sign
of
dawn
but
the
watcher
by
the
fire
beyond
was
astir
now
in
the
imminence
of
dawn
and
evidently
meant
to
warm
himself
before
leaving
eve
could
hear
him
piling
dry
wood
on
the
fire
the
light
on
the
tree
trunks
grew
redder
a
pungent
reek
of
smoke
was
drawn
through
the
forest
aisles
she
sniffed
it
listened
and
watched
her
rifle
across
her
knees
eve
never
had
been
afraid
of
anything
she
was
not
afraid
of
this
man
if
it
came
to
combat
she
would
have
to
kill
it
never
entered
her
mind
to
fear
quintana
rifle
even
clinch
was
not
as
swift
with
a
rifle
as
she
only
stormont
had
been
swifter
thank
god
she
thought
of
stormont
sat
there
in
the
terrific
darkness
loving
him
her
heart
of
a
child
tremulous
with
adoration
then
the
memory
of
darragh
pushed
in
and
hot
hatred
possessed
her
always
in
her
heart
she
had
distrusted
the
man
instinct
had
warned
her
a
spy
what
evil
had
he
worked
already
where
was
her
father
evidently
quintana
had
escaped
him
at
drowned
valley
quintana
was
yonder
by
his
fire
preparing
to
flee
the
wilderness
where
men
hunted
him
but
where
was
clinch
had
this
sneak
darragh
betrayed
him
was
clinch
already
in
the
clutch
of
the
state
troopers
was
he
in
at
the
thought
the
girl
felt
slightly
faint
then
a
rush
of
angry
blood
stung
her
face
in
the
darkness
except
for
game
and
excise
violations
the
stories
they
told
about
clinch
were
lies
he
had
nothing
to
fear
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
harrod
had
driven
him
to
lawlessness
the
government
took
away
what
was
left
him
to
make
a
living
he
had
to
live
what
if
he
did
break
laws
made
by
millionaire
and
fanatic
what
of
it
he
had
her
love
and
her
respect
and
her
deep
deep
pity
and
these
were
enough
for
any
girl
to
fight
for
dawn
spread
a
silvery
light
above
the
pines
but
quintana
fire
still
reddened
the
tree
trunks
and
she
could
hear
him
feeding
it
at
intervals
finally
she
saw
him
he
came
out
on
the
edge
of
the
ruddy
ring
of
light
and
stood
peering
around
at
the
woods
where
already
a
vague
greyness
was
revealing
nearer
trees
when
finally
he
turned
his
back
and
looked
at
his
fire
eve
rose
and
stood
between
the
two
big
pines
behind
one
of
them
she
placed
her
rifle
it
was
growing
lighter
in
the
woods
she
could
see
quintana
in
the
fire
ring
and
outside
saw
him
go
to
the
spring
rivulet
lie
flat
drink
then
on
his
knees
wash
face
and
hands
in
the
icy
water
it
became
plain
to
her
that
he
was
nearly
ready
to
depart
she
watched
him
preparing
and
now
she
could
see
him
plainly
and
knew
him
to
be
quintana
and
no
other
he
had
a
light
basket
pack
he
put
some
articles
into
it
stretched
himself
and
yawned
pulled
on
his
hat
hoisted
the
pack
and
fastened
it
to
his
back
stood
staring
at
the
fire
for
a
long
time
then
with
a
sudden
upward
look
at
the
zenith
where
a
slight
flush
stained
a
cloud
he
picked
up
his
rifle
at
that
moment
eve
called
to
him
in
a
clear
and
steady
voice
the
effect
on
quintana
was
instant
he
was
behind
a
tree
before
her
voice
ceased
hallo
hi
you
over
there
she
called
again
this
is
eve
strayer
looking
for
clinch
he
has
been
home
all
night
have
you
seen
him
after
a
moment
she
saw
quintana
head
watching
her
not
at
the
of
a
man
but
close
to
the
ground
and
just
above
the
tree
roots
hey
she
cried
what
the
matter
with
you
over
there
i
asking
you
who
you
are
and
if
you
seen
my
father
after
a
while
she
saw
quintana
coming
toward
her
circling
creeping
swiftly
from
tree
to
tree
as
he
flitted
through
the
shadows
the
trees
between
which
she
was
standing
hid
her
from
him
a
moment
instantly
she
placed
her
rifle
on
the
ground
and
kicked
the
pine
needles
over
it
as
quintana
continued
his
encircling
manoeuvres
eve
apparently
perplexed
walked
out
into
the
clear
space
putting
the
concealed
trap
between
her
and
quintana
who
now
came
stealthily
toward
her
from
the
rear
it
was
evident
that
he
had
reconnoitred
sufficiently
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
girl
was
alone
and
that
no
trick
no
ambuscade
threatened
him
and
now
from
behind
a
pine
and
startlingly
near
her
came
quintana
moving
with
confident
grace
yet
holding
his
rifle
ready
for
any
emergency
eve
horrified
stare
was
natural
she
had
not
realised
that
any
man
could
wear
so
evil
a
smile
quintana
stopped
short
a
dozen
paces
away
the
dramatic
in
him
demanded
of
the
moment
its
full
value
he
swept
off
his
hat
with
a
flourish
bowed
deeply
where
he
stood
ah
he
cried
gaily
the
happy
encounter
señorita
god
is
too
good
to
us
and
it
was
but
a
moment
since
my
thoughts
were
of
you
i
swear
it
it
was
not
fear
it
was
a
sort
of
slow
horror
of
this
man
that
began
to
creep
over
the
girl
she
stared
at
his
brilliant
eyes
at
his
thick
mouth
too
red
shuddered
slightly
but
the
toe
of
her
right
foot
touched
the
stock
of
her
rifle
under
the
pine
needles
she
held
herself
under
control
so
it
you
she
said
unsteadily
i
thought
our
people
had
caught
you
quintana
laughed
charming
child
he
said
it
is
who
have
caught
your
people
and
now
my
god
i
catch
it
is
ver
funny
is
it
not
she
looked
straight
into
quintana
black
eyes
but
the
look
he
returned
sent
the
shamed
blood
surging
into
her
face
by
god
he
said
between
his
white
even
teeth
by
god
staring
at
her
he
slowly
disengaged
his
pack
let
it
fall
behind
him
on
the
pine
needles
rested
his
rifle
on
it
slipped
out
of
his
mackinaw
and
laid
that
across
his
rifle
always
keeping
his
brilliant
eyes
on
her
his
lips
tightened
the
muscles
in
his
dark
face
grew
tense
his
eyes
became
a
blazing
insult
for
an
instant
he
stood
there
unencumbered
a
wiry
graceful
shape
in
his
woollen
breeches
leggings
and
grey
shirt
open
at
the
throat
then
he
took
a
step
toward
her
and
the
girl
watched
him
fascinated
one
pace
two
a
third
a
fourth
the
girl
involuntary
cry
echoed
the
stumbling
crash
of
the
man
thrashing
clawing
scrambling
in
the
clenched
jaws
of
the
amid
a
whirl
of
flying
pine
needles
he
screamed
once
tried
to
rise
turned
blindly
to
seize
the
jaws
that
clutched
him
and
suddenly
crouched
cringing
like
a
trapped
wolf
the
true
fatalist
among
our
lesser
brothers
eve
picked
up
her
rifle
she
was
trembling
violently
then
mastering
her
emotion
she
walked
over
to
the
pack
placed
quintana
rifle
and
mackinaw
in
it
coolly
hoisted
it
to
her
shoulders
and
buckled
it
there
over
her
shoulder
she
kept
an
eye
on
quintana
who
crouched
where
he
had
fallen
unstirring
his
deadly
eyes
watching
her
she
placed
the
muzzle
of
her
rifle
against
his
stomach
rested
it
so
holding
it
with
one
hand
and
her
finger
at
the
trigger
at
her
brief
order
he
turned
out
both
breeches
pockets
she
herself
stooped
and
drew
the
spanish
from
its
sheath
at
his
belt
took
a
pistol
from
the
holster
another
out
of
his
hip
pocket
reaching
up
and
behind
her
she
dropped
these
into
the
pack
maybe
she
said
slowly
your
ankle
is
broken
i
send
somebody
from
ghost
lake
to
find
you
but
whether
you
a
broken
bone
or
not
not
go
very
far
quintana
after
i
gone
you
be
able
to
free
yourself
but
you
ca
get
away
you
be
followed
and
caught
so
if
you
can
walk
at
all
you
better
go
in
to
ghost
lake
and
give
yourself
up
it
that
or
starvation
you
got
a
watch
do
stir
or
touch
that
trap
for
half
an
hour
and
that
all
as
she
moved
away
toward
the
drowned
valley
trail
she
looked
back
at
him
his
face
was
bloodless
but
his
black
eyes
blazed
if
ever
you
come
into
this
forest
again
she
said
my
father
will
surely
kill
you
to
her
horror
quintana
slowly
grinned
at
her
then
still
grinning
he
placed
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
between
his
teeth
and
bit
it
whatever
he
meant
by
the
gesture
it
seemed
unclean
horrible
and
the
girl
hurried
on
seized
with
an
overwhelming
loathing
through
which
a
sort
of
terror
pulsated
like
evil
premonition
in
a
heavy
and
tortured
heart
straight
into
the
fire
of
dawn
she
sped
a
pale
primrose
light
glimmered
through
the
woods
trees
bushes
undergrowth
turned
a
dusky
purple
already
the
few
small
clouds
overhead
were
edged
with
fiery
rose
then
of
a
sudden
a
shaft
of
flame
played
over
the
forest
the
sun
had
risen
hastening
she
searched
the
soft
path
for
any
imprint
of
her
foot
and
even
in
the
vain
search
she
hoped
to
find
him
at
home
hurried
on
burdened
with
two
rifles
and
a
pack
still
all
nervous
and
aquiver
from
her
encounter
with
quintana
surely
surely
she
thought
if
he
had
missed
quintana
in
drowned
valley
he
would
not
linger
in
that
ghastly
place
he
come
home
call
in
his
men
take
counsel
perhaps
mist
over
star
pond
was
dissolving
to
a
golden
powder
in
the
blinding
glory
of
the
sun
the
eastern
in
clinch
dump
glittered
as
though
the
rooms
inside
were
all
on
fire
down
through
withered
weeds
and
scrub
she
hurried
ran
across
the
grass
to
the
kitchen
door
which
swung
ajar
under
its
porch
dad
she
called
dad
only
her
own
frightened
voice
echoed
in
the
empty
house
she
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
room
the
bed
lay
undisturbed
as
she
had
made
it
he
was
not
in
any
of
the
rooms
there
were
no
signs
of
him
slowly
she
descended
to
the
kitchen
he
was
not
there
the
food
she
had
prepared
for
him
had
become
cold
on
a
chilled
range
for
a
long
while
she
stood
staring
through
the
window
at
the
sunlight
outside
probably
since
quintana
had
eluded
him
he
come
home
for
something
to
eat
surely
now
that
quintana
had
escaped
clinch
would
come
back
for
some
breakfast
eve
slipped
the
pack
from
her
back
and
laid
it
on
the
kitchen
table
there
was
kindling
in
the
she
shook
down
the
cinders
laid
a
fire
soaked
it
with
kerosene
lighted
it
filled
the
kettle
with
fresh
water
in
the
pantry
she
cut
some
ham
and
found
eggs
condensed
milk
butter
bread
and
an
apple
pie
after
she
had
ground
the
coffee
she
placed
all
these
on
a
tray
and
carried
them
into
the
kitchen
now
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
until
her
father
came
and
she
sat
down
by
the
kitchen
table
to
wait
outside
the
sunlight
was
becoming
warm
and
vivid
there
had
been
no
frost
after
all
or
at
most
merely
a
white
trace
in
the
shadow
on
a
fallen
plank
here
and
there
but
not
enough
to
freeze
the
ground
and
in
the
sunshine
it
all
quickly
turned
to
dew
and
glittered
and
sparkled
in
a
million
hues
and
tints
like
gems
like
that
handful
of
jewels
she
had
poured
into
her
father
joined
palms
yesterday
there
at
the
ghostly
edge
of
drowned
valley
at
the
memory
and
quite
mechanically
she
turned
in
her
chair
and
drew
quintana
basket
pack
toward
her
first
she
lifted
out
his
rifle
examined
it
set
it
against
the
window
sill
then
one
by
one
she
drew
out
two
pistols
loaded
the
murderous
spanish
an
axe
a
and
a
tin
pail
and
the
mackinaw
under
these
the
pack
seemed
to
contain
nothing
except
food
and
ammunition
staples
in
sacks
and
a
few
cans
lard
salt
tea
such
things
the
cartridge
boxes
she
piled
up
on
the
table
the
food
she
tossed
into
a
tin
swill
bucket
about
the
effects
of
this
man
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
something
unclean
lingered
she
could
scarcely
bear
to
handle
them
threw
them
from
her
with
disgust
the
garment
also
the
heavy
brown
and
green
mackinaw
she
disliked
to
touch
to
throw
it
out
doors
was
her
intention
but
as
she
lifted
the
coat
it
unrolled
and
some
things
fell
from
the
pockets
to
the
kitchen
table
money
keys
a
watch
a
flat
leather
case
she
looked
stupidly
at
the
case
it
had
a
coat
of
arms
emblazoned
on
it
still
stupidly
and
as
though
dazed
she
laid
one
hand
on
it
drew
it
to
her
opened
it
the
flaming
jewel
blazed
in
her
face
amid
a
heap
of
glittering
gems
still
she
seemed
slow
to
comprehend
as
though
understanding
were
paralysed
it
was
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
watch
that
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
suddenly
her
stunned
senses
were
lighted
as
by
an
infernal
flare
under
the
awful
blow
she
swayed
upright
to
her
feet
sick
with
fright
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
father
watch
it
was
still
ticking
she
did
not
know
whether
she
cried
out
in
anguish
or
was
dumb
under
it
the
house
seemed
to
reel
around
her
under
foot
too
when
she
came
to
her
senses
she
found
herself
outside
the
house
running
with
her
rifle
already
entering
the
woods
but
inside
the
barrier
of
trees
something
blocked
her
way
stopped
her
a
man
man
eve
in
god
name
he
said
as
she
struggled
in
his
arms
but
she
fought
him
and
strove
to
tear
her
body
from
his
embrace
they
killed
dad
she
panted
quintana
killed
him
i
know
oh
i
did
know
and
i
let

and
the
case
of
jewels
they
were
in
his
pack
on
the
kitchen
table
eve
let
me
go
he
held
her
rigid
a
moment
in
his
powerful
grip
compelled
her
dazed
eyes
to
meet
his
own
you
must
come
to
your
senses
he
said
listen
to
what
i
say
they
are
in
your
her
dilated
blue
eyes
never
moved
from
his
we
found
him
in
drowned
valley
at
sunrise
said
stormont
quietly
the
men
are
only
a
few
rods
behind
me
they
are
carrying
him
out
her
lips
made
a
word
without
sound
yes
said
stormont
in
a
low
voice
there
was
a
sound
in
the
woods
behind
them
stormont
turned
far
away
down
the
trail
the
men
came
into
sight
then
the
state
trooper
turned
the
girl
very
gently
and
placed
one
arm
around
her
shoulders
very
slowly
they
descended
the
hill
together
his
equipment
was
shining
in
the
morning
sun
and
the
sun
fell
on
eve
drooping
head
turning
her
chestnut
hair
to
fiery
gold
an
hour
later
trooper
stormont
was
at
the
place
of
pines
there
was
nothing
there
except
an
empty
trap
and
the
ashes
of
the
dying
fire
beyond
episode
twelve
her
highness
intervenes
i
toward
noon
the
wind
changed
and
about
one
it
began
to
snow
eve
exhausted
lay
on
the
sofa
in
her
bedroom
her
lay
on
a
table
in
the
dance
hall
below
covered
by
a
sheet
from
his
own
bed
and
beside
him
sat
trooper
stormont
waiting
it
was
snowing
heavily
when
lyken
the
little
undertaker
from
ghost
lake
arrived
with
several
assistants
a
casket
and
what
he
called
swell
trimmings
long
ago
mike
clinch
had
selected
his
own
mortuary
site
and
had
driven
a
section
of
iron
pipe
into
the
ground
on
a
ferny
knoll
overlooking
star
pond
in
explanation
he
grimly
remarked
to
eve
that
after
death
he
preferred
to
be
planted
where
he
could
see
that
old
harrod
ghost
did
trespass
here
two
of
lyken
able
assistants
dug
a
grave
while
the
digging
was
still
good
for
if
mike
clinch
was
to
lie
underground
that
season
there
might
be
need
of
haste
no
weather
prophet
ever
having
successfully
forecast
adirondack
weather
eve
exhausted
by
shock
and
a
sleepless
night
was
spared
the
more
harrowing
details
of
the
coroner
visit
and
the
subsequent
jaunty
activities
of
lyken
and
his
efficient
assistants
she
had
managed
to
dress
herself
in
a
black
wool
gown
intending
to
watch
by
mike
but
stormont
blunt
authority
prevailed
and
she
lay
down
for
an
hour
rest
the
hour
lengthened
into
many
hours
the
girl
slept
heavily
on
her
sofa
under
blankets
laid
over
her
by
stormont
all
that
dark
snowy
day
she
slept
mercifully
unconscious
of
the
proceedings
below
in
its
own
mysterious
way
the
news
penetrated
the
wilderness
and
out
of
the
desolation
of
forest
and
swamp
and
mountain
drifted
the
people
who
somehow
existed
there
a
few
shy
half
wild
young
girls
a
dozen
silent
lank
men
two
or
three
of
clinch
own
people
who
stood
silently
about
in
the
falling
snow
and
lent
a
hand
whenever
requested
one
long
shanked
youth
cut
hemlock
to
line
the
grave
others
erected
a
little
fence
of
silver
birch
around
it
making
of
the
enclosure
a
plot
a
gaunt
old
woman
from
god
knows
where
aided
lyken
at
intervals
a
pretty
girl
with
her
slovenly
sister
cooked
for
anybody
who
desired
nourishment
when
mike
was
ready
to
hold
the
inevitable
reception
everybody
filed
into
the
dance
hall
lyken
was
master
of
ceremonies
trooper
stormont
stood
very
tall
and
straight
by
the
head
of
the
casket
clinch
wore
a
vague
indefinable
smile
and
his
best
clothes
that
same
smile
which
had
so
troubled
josé
quintana
light
was
fading
fast
in
the
room
when
the
last
visitor
took
silent
leave
of
clinch
and
rejoined
the
groups
in
the
kitchen
where
were
the
funeral
baked
meats
eve
still
slept
descending
again
from
his
reconnaissance
trooper
stormont
encountered
trooper
lannis
below
has

up

the
former

so
far

the
two
troopers
went
into
the
dance
hall
where
darragh
was
arranging
the
flowers
from
his
greenhouses
stormont
said
quietly

she
got
his
pack
and
found
mike
watch
and
jewelry
in
it
what
jewelry
the
jewels
quintana
was
after
but
that
was
after
she
arrived
at
the
dump
here
leaving
quintana
to
get
free
of
the
trap
and
beat
it
that
how
i

crazed

into
eve
i

they
picked
up
quintana
tracks
so
far
after
a
silence
too
bad
this
snow

so
late
remarked
trooper
lannis
but
we
ought
to
get
quintana
anyway
darragh
went
over
and
looked
silently
at
mike
clinch

said
under
his
breath
it
was
your
fault
and
it
was
mine

he
came
back
slowly
to
where
stormont

standing
near

said
trooper
stormont
reddening
they
clasped
hands
then
stormont
went
about
and
lighted
the
candles
in
the
room
clinch
face
again
revealed
was
still
faintly
amused
at
something
or
other
the
dead
have
much
to
be
amused
at
as
darragh
was
about

darragh
she
wo

i
fancy
remarked
stormont
he
stood
by
the
veranda
and
watched
darragh
take
the
lake
trail
through
the
snow
finally
the
glimmer
of
his
swinging
lantern
was
lost
in
the
woods
and
stormont
mounted
the
stairs
once
more
stood
silently
by
open
door
realised
she
was
still
heavily
asleep
and
seated
himself
on
a
chair
outside
her
door
to
watch
and
wait
all
night
long
it
snowed
hard
over
the
star
pond
country
and
the
late
grey
light
of
morning
revealed
a
blinding
storm
pelting
a
white
robed
world
toward
ten
stormont
on
guard
noticed
that
eve
was
growing
restless
downstairs
the
flotsam
of
the
forest
had
gathered
again
lyken
was
there
in
black
gloves
the
reverend
laomi
smatter
had
arrived
in
a
sleigh
from
ghost
lake
both
were
breakfasting
heavily
the
pretty
girl
fetched
a
tray
and
placed
eve
breakfast
on
it
and
trooper
stormont
carried
it
to
her
room
she
was
awake
when
he
entered
he
set
the
tray
on
the
table
she
put
both
arms
around
his
neck
jack
she
murmured
her
eyes
tremulous
with
tears
everything
has
been
done
he
said
will
you
be
ready
by
eleven
come
for
you
she
clung
to
him
in
silence
for
a
while
at
eleven
he
knocked
on
her
door
she
opened
it
she
wore
her
black
wool
gown
and
a
black
fur
turban
some
of
her
pallor
remained
traces
of
tears
and
bluish
smears
under
both
eyes
but
her
voice
was
steady
could
i
see
dad
a
moment
alone
of
course
she
took
his
arm
they
descended
the
stairs
there
seemed
to
be
many
people
about
but
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
until
her
lover
led
her
into
the
dance
hall
where
clinch
lay
smiling
his
mysterious
smile
then
stormont
left
her
alone
there
and
closed
the
door
in
a
terrific
they
buried
mike
clinch
on
the
spot
he
had
selected
in
order
that
he
might
keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
trespassing
ghost
of
old
man
harrod
it
blew
and
stormed
and
stormed
and
the
thin
nasal
voice
of
rev
smatter
was
utterly
lost
in
the
wind
the
slanting
lances
of
snow
drove
down
on
the
casket
building
a
white
mound
over
the
flowers
blotting
the
hemlock
boughs
from
sight
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
now
the
ground
was
freezing
under
a
veering
and
bitter
wind
out
of
the
west
lyken
talented
assistants
had
some
difficulty
in
shaping
the
mound
which
snow
began
to
make
into
a
white
and
flawless
monument
the
last
slap
of
the
spade
rang
with
a
metallic
jar
across
the
lake
where
snow
already
blotted
the
newly
forming
film
of
ice
the
human
denizens
of
the
wilderness
filtered
back
into
it
one
by
one

into
his

concerned
about

darragh
in
a
low
voice

a
time

good
time

want
her
to
come
to
harrod

wo

she
feels
toward

jim
i

indeed
and
i
do
blame
her
but
let
me
tell

eve
strayer
is
the
most
honest
and
girl
i
ever
knew

i
take
a
chance
that
she
listen
to
me
sooner
or
later
she
will
be
obliged
to
hear
what
i
have
to
tell
her
but
it
will
be
easier
for
her
for
everybody
if
i
speak
to
her
now
let
me
try
jack
stormont
hesitated
looked
at
him
nodded
darragh
stood
his
rifle
against
the
bench
on
the
kitchen
porch
they
entered
the
house
slowly
and
met
eve
descending
the
stairs
the
girl
looked
at
darragh
astonished
then
her
pale
face
flushed
with
anger
what
are
you
doing
in
this
house
she
demanded
unsteadily
have
you
no
decency
no
shame
yes
he
said
i
am
ashamed
of
what
my
kinsman
has
done
to
you
and
yours
that
is
partly
why
i
am
here
you
came
here
as
a
spy
she
said
with
hot
contempt
you
lied
about
your
name
you
lied
about
your
purpose
you
came
here
to
betray
dad
if
he
known
it
he
would
have
killed
you
yes
he
would
have
but
do
you
know
why
i
came
here
eve
i
told
you
and
you
are
wrong
i
did
come
here
to
betray
mike
clinch
i
came
to
save
him
do
you
suppose
i
believe
a
man
who
has
lied
to
dad
she
cried
i
do
ask
you
to
eve
i
shall
let
somebody
else
prove
what
i
say
i
do
blame
you
for
your
attitude
god
knows
i
do
blame
mike
clinch
he
stood
up
like
a
man
to
henry
harrod
all
i
ask
is
to
undo
some
of
the
rotten
things
that
my
uncle
did
to
you
and
yours
and
that
is
partly
why
i
came
here
the
girl
said
passionately
neither
dad
nor
i
want
anything
from
harrod
place
or
from
you
do
you
suppose
you
can
come
here
after
dad
is
dead
and
pretend
you
want
to
make
amends
for
what
your
uncle
did
to
us
eve
said
darragh
gravely
i
made
some
amends
already
you
know
it
but
i
have
you
may
not
believe
it
but
i
liked
your
father
he
was
a
real
man
had
anybody
done
to
me
what
henry
harrod
did
to
your
father
i
have
behaved
as
your
father
behaved
i
never
have
budged
from
this
spot
i
have
hunted
where
i
chose
i
have
borne
an
implacable
hatred
against
henry
harrod
and
harrod
place
and
every
soul
in
it
the
girl
silenced
looked
at
him
without
belief
he
said
i
am
not
surprised
that
you
distrust
what
i
say
but
the
man
you
are
going
to
marry
was
a
junior
officer
in
my
command
i
have
no
closer
friend
than
jack
stormont
ask
him
whether
i
am
to
be
believed
astounded
the
girl
turned
a
flushed
incredulous
face
to
stormont
he
said
you
may
trust
darragh
as
you
trust
me
i
do
know
what
he
has
to
say
to
you
dear
but
whatever
he
says
will
be
the
truth
darragh
said
gravely
through
a
misunderstanding
your
father
came
into
possession
of
stolen
property
eve
he
did
not
know
it
had
been
stolen
i
did
but
mike
clinch
would
not
have
believed
me
if
i
had
told
him
that
the
case
of
jewels
in
his
possession
had
been
stolen
from
a
woman
quintana
stole
them
by
accident
they
came
into
your
possession
i
learned
of
this
i
had
promised
this
woman
to
recover
her
jewels
i
came
here
for
that
purpose
eve
and
for
two
reasons
first
because
i
learned
that
quintana
also
was
coming
here
to
rob
your
father
of
these
gems
second
because
when
i
knew
your
father
and
knew
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
an
outrage
to
call
on
the
police
it
would
mean
prison
for
clinch
misery
and
ruin
for
you
eve
so
i
tried
to
steal
the
jewels
to
save
you
both
he
looked
at
stormont
who
seemed
astonished
to
whom
do
these
jewels
belong
jim
demanded
the
trooper
to
the
young
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
do
you
remember
that
i
befriended
her
over
there
yes
do
you
remember
that
the
reds
were
accused
of
burning
her
château
and
looting
it
yes
i
remember
well
it
was
quintana
and
his
gang
of
international
criminals
who
did
that
said
darragh
drily
and
to
eve
by
accident
this
case
of
jewels
emblazoned
with
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
came
into
your
possession
that
is
the
story
eve
there
was
a
silence
the
girl
looked
at
stormont
flushed
painfully
looked
at
darragh
then
without
a
word
she
turned
ascended
the
stairs
and
reappeared
immediately
carrying
the
leather
case
thank
you
darragh
she
said
simply
and
laid
the
case
in
his
hand
but
said
darragh
i
want
you
to
do
a
little
more
eve
the
owner
of
these
gems
is
my
guest
at
harrod
place
i
want
you
to
give
them
to
her
yourself
i
i
ca
go
to
harrod
place
stammered
the
girl
please
do
visit
the
sins
of
henry
harrod
on
me
eve
i
do
but
but
that
place
after
a
silence
if
eve
feels
that
way
began
stormont
awkwardly
i
could
become
associated
with
you
in
business
jim
i
rather
sell
harrod
place
than
lose
you
retorted
darragh
almost
sharply
i
want
to
go
into
business
with
you
jack
if
eve
will
permit
me
she
stood
looking
at
stormont
the
heightened
colour
playing
in
her
cheeks
as
she
began
to
comprehend
the
comradeship
between
these
two
men
slowly
she
turned
to
darragh
offered
her
hand
i
go
to
harrod
place
she
said
in
a
low
voice
darragh
quick
smile
brightened
the
sombre
gravity
of
his
face
eve
he
said
when
i
came
over
here
this
morning
from
harrod
place
i
was
afraid
you
would
refuse
to
listen
to
me
i
was
afraid
you
would
not
even
see
me
and
so
i
brought
with
me
somebody
to
whom
i
felt
certain
you
would
listen
i
brought
with
me
a
young
girl
a
poor
refugee
from
russia
once
wealthy
almost
penniless
her
name
is
theodorica
once
she
was
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
but
this
morning
a
clergyman
from
five
lakes
changed
her
name
to
such
friends
as
you
and
jack
she
is
ricca
darragh
now
and
she
having
a
wonderful
time
on
her
new
he
took
eve
by
one
hand
and
stormont
by
the
other
and
drew
them
to
the
kitchen
door
and
kicked
it
open
through
the
swirling
snow
over
on
the
at
the
timber
edge
a
graceful
boyish
figure
in
scarlet
and
white
wool
moved
swiftly
over
the
drifts
with
all
the
naïve
delight
of
a
child
with
a
brand
new
toy
as
darragh
strode
out
into
the
open
the
distant
figure
flung
up
one
arm
in
salutation
and
came
racing
over
the
drifts
her
brilliant
scarf
flying
all
aglow
and
a
trifle
breathless
she
met
darragh
just
beyond
the
veranda
rested
one
mittened
hand
on
his
shoulder
while
he
knelt
and
unbuckled
her
stepped
lightly
from
them
and
came
forward
to
eve
with
hand
and
a
sudden
winning
gravity
in
her
lovely
face
we
shall
be
friends
surely
she
said
in
her
quick
winning
voice
because
my
husband
has
told
me
and
i
am
so
grieved
for
you
and
i
need
a
girl
friend
holding
both
eve
hands
her
mittens
dangling
from
her
wrist
she
looked
into
her
eyes
very
steadily
slowly
eve
eyes
filled
more
slowly
still
ricca
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
framed
her
face
in
both
hands
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
lips
then
still
holding
eve
hands
she
turned
and
looked
at
stormont
i
remember
you
now
she
said
you
were
with
my
husband
in
riga
she
freed
her
right
hand
and
held
it
out
to
stormont
he
had
the
grace
to
kiss
it
and
did
it
very
well
for
a
yankee
together
they
entered
the
kitchen
door
and
turned
into
the
dining
room
on
the
left
where
were
chairs
around
the
plain
pine
table
darragh
said
the
new
mistress
of
harrod
place

trotting
into
one
another
rooms

looked
gravely
at
eve

she
will
like
you
very
much
as
for
me
i
already
love
you
she
put
one
arm
around
eve
shoulders
how
could
you
even
think
of
remaining
here
all
alone
why
i
should
never
close
my
eyes
for
thinking
of
you

eve
head
drooped
she
said
in
a
stifled
voice

darragh

eve
turned
tragically
to
her
lover
in
dad
closet
she
said
choking
then
turned
and
went
up
the
stairs
still
clinging
to
hand
and
drawing
her
with
her
stormont
followed
entered
clinch
quarters
and
presently
came
downstairs
again
carrying
clinch
and
a
basket
pack
he
seated
himself
near
darragh
after
a
silence
your
wife

up

this
loneliness
and
shame
and
misery
of
clinch
dump
stormont
touched
his
arm
in
caution
eve
and
ricca
came
down
the
stairs
the
former
now
in
the
grey
wool
dress
and
carrying
her
black
gown
and
toilet
articles
stormont
began
to
stow
away
her
effects
in
the
basket
pack
darragh
went
over
to
her
and
took
her
hand
i
so
glad
we
are
to
be
friends
he
said
it
hurt
a
lot
to
know
you
held
me
in
contempt
but
i
had
to
go
about
it
that
way
eve
nodded
then
suddenly
recollecting
oh
she
exclaimed
reddening
i
forgot
the
jewel
case
it
under
my
pillow
she
turned
and
sped
upstairs
and
reappeared
almost
instantly
carrying
the
breathless
flushed
thankful
and
happy
in
the
excitement
of
restitution
she
placed
the
leather
case
in
ricca
hands
my
jewels
cried
the
girl
astounded
then
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
she
placed
the
case
upon
the
table
stripped
open
the
emblazoned
cover
and
emptied
the
two
trays
all
over
the
table
rolled
the
jewels
flashing
scintillating
ablaze
with
blinding
light
and
at
the
same
instant
the
outer
door
crashed
open
and
quintana
covered
them
with
darragh
rifle
now
by
christ
he
shouted
who
stirs
a
finger
shall
go
to
god
in
one
jump

my
gendarme
frien
my
frien
smith

or
i
kill
sure
by
jesus
i
kill
you
like
i
would
some
white
little
mice
with
incredible
quickness
he
stepped
forward
and
swept
the
jewels
into
one
hand
filled
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
caught
up
every
stray
stone
and
pocketed
them
you
gendarme
he
cried
in
a
menacing
voice
you
think
you
shall
follow
in
my
track
yes
i
blow
your
damn
head
off
if
you
stir
before
the
hour
after
that
well
follow
and
be
damn
even
as
he
spoke
he
stepped
outside
and
slammed
the
door
and
darragh
and
stormont
leaped
for
it
then
the
loud
detonation
of
quintana
rifle
was
echoed
by
the
splintering
rip
of
bullets
tearing
through
the
closed
door
and
both
men
halted
in
the
face
of
the
leaden
hail
eve
ran
to
the
pantry
window
and
saw
quintana
in
somebody
stolen
lash
a
big
pair
of
horses
to
a
gallop
and
go
floundering
past
into
the
ghost
lake
road
as
he
sped
by
in
a
whirl
of
snow
he
fired
five
times
at
the
house
then
rising
and
swinging
his
whip
he
flogged
the
frantic
horses
into
the
woods
in
the
dining
room
stormont
red
with
rage
and
shame
and
having
found
his
rifle
in
the
corridor
outside
eve
bedroom
was
trying
to
open
the
shutters
for
a
shot
and
darragh
searched
the
house
frantically
for
a
weapon
eve
terribly
excited
came
from
the
pantry
he
gone
she
cried
furiously
he
in
somebody
with
a
pair
of
horses
and
he
driving
west
like
the
devil
stormont
ran
to
the
telephone
cranked
it
and
warned
the
constabulary
at
five
lakes
good
god
he
exclaimed
turning
to
darragh
scarlet
with
mortification
what
a
ghastly
business
i
never
dreamed
he
was
within
miles
of
clinch
it
the
most
shameful
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
what
could
anybody
do
under
that
rifle
said
eve
hotly
that
beast
would
have
murdered
the
first
person
who
stirred
darragh
exasperated
and
dreadfully
humiliated
looked
miserably
at
his
wife
eve
and
stormont
also
looked
at
her
she
had
come
forward
from
the
rear
of
the
stairway
where
quintana
had
brutally
driven
her
now
she
stood
with
one
hand
on
the
empty
leather
jewel
case
looking
at
everybody
out
of
pretty
bewildered
eyes
to
darragh
in
a
perplexed
unsteady
voice
is
it
the
same
bandit
who
robbed
us
before
yes
quintana
he
said
wretchedly
rage
began
to
redden
his
features
ricca
he
said
i
promised
i
find
your
jewels
i
promise
you
again
that
i
never
drop
this
business
until
your
gems
and
the
flaming
jewel
are
in
your
possession
but
jim
i
swear
it
he
exclaimed
violently
i
not
such
a
stupid
fool
as
i
seem
dear
she
protested
excitedly
you
done
what
you
promised
my
gems
in
my
possession
i
believe
she
caught
up
the
emblazoned
case
stripped
out
the
first
tray
then
the
second
and
flung
them
aside
then
searching
with
the
delicate
tip
of
her
forefinger
in
the
empty
case
she
suddenly
pressed
the
bottom
hard
thumb
middle
finger
and
little
finger
forming
the
three
apexes
of
an
equilateral
triangle
there
came
a
clear
tiny
sound
like
the
ringing
of
the
alarm
in
a
repeating
watch
very
gently
the
false
bottom
of
the
case
detached
itself
and
came
away
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
there
each
embedded
in
its
own
shaped
compartment
of
chamois
lay
the
esthonian
jewels
the
true
ones
deep
hidden
always
doubly
guarded
by
two
sets
of
perfect
imitations
lining
the
two
visible
trays
above
and
in
the
centre
blazed
the
erosite
gem
the
magnificent
flaming
jewel
a
glory
of
living
blinding
fire
nobody
stirred
or
spoke
darragh
blinked
at
the
crystalline
blaze
as
though
stunned
then
the
young
girl
who
had
once
been
her
serene
highness
theodorica
grand
duchess
of
esthonia
looked
up
at
her
husband
and
laughed
did
you
really
suppose
it
was
these
that
brought
me
across
the
ocean
did
you
suppose
it
was
a
passion
for
these
that
filled
my
heart
did
you
think
it
was
for
these
that
i
followed
you
she
laughed
again
turned
to
eve
understand
tell
him
that
if
he
had
been
in
rags
i
would
have
followed
him
like
a
gypsy
they
say
there
is
gypsy
blood
in
us
god
knows
i
think
perhaps
there
is
a
little
of
it
in
all
real
women
still
laughing
she
placed
her
hand
lightly
upon
her
heart
in
all
women
perhaps
a
flaming
jewel
imbedded
here
her
eyes
tender
and
mocking
met
his
she
lifted
the
closed
it
and
placed
it
in
his
hands
now
she
said
you
have
everything
in
your
possession
and
we
are
safe
we
are
quite
safe
now
my
jewels
and
i
then
she
went
to
eve
and
rested
both
hands
on
her
shoulders
shall
we
put
on
our
and
go
home
stormont
flung
open
the
door
outside
in
the
snow
he
dropped
on
both
knees
to
buckle
on
eve
darragh
was
performing
a
like
office
for
his
wife
and
the
state
trooper
being
unobserved
took
eve
slim
hands
and
kissed
them
looking
up
at
her
where
he
was
kneeling
her
pale
face
blushed
as
it
had
that
day
in
the
woods
on
owl
marsh
so
long
so
long
ago
when
this
man
lips
first
touched
her
hands
as
their
eyes
met
both
remembered
then
she
smiled
at
her
lover
with
the
shy
girl
soul
of
her
gazing
out
at
him
through
eyes
as
blue
as
the
wild
that
grow
among
the
ferns
and
mosses
of
star
pond
far
away
in
the
northwestern
forests
quintana
still
lashed
his
horses
through
the
primeval
pines
triumphant
reckless
resourceful
dangerous
he
felt
that
now
nothing
could
stop
him
nothing
bar
his
way
to
freedom
out
of
the
wilderness
lay
his
road
and
his
destiny
out
of
it
he
must
win
his
way
by
strategy
by
cunning
by
violence
creep
out
lie
his
way
out
shoot
his
way
out
it
scarcely
mattered
he
was
going
out
he
was
going
back
to
life
once
more
who
could
forbid
him
who
stop
him
who
deny
him
now
when
in
his
pockets
he
held
all
that
was
worth
living
for
the
keys
to
power
to
pleasure
the
key
to
everything
on
earth
in
fierce
exultation
he
slapped
the
glass
jewels
in
his
pocket
and
laughed
aloud
the
keys
to
the
world
he
cried
let
him
stop
me
and
take
them
who
is
a
better
man
than
i
then
his
long
whip
whistled
and
he
cursed
his
horses
then
of
a
sudden
close
by
in
the
snowy
road
ahead
he
saw
a
state
trooper
on
saw
the
upflung
arm
warning
him
screamed
curses
at
his
horses
flogged
them
forward
to
crush
this
thing
to
death
that
dared
menace
him
this
object
that
suddenly
rose
up
out
of
nowhere
to
snatch
from
him
the
keys
of
the
world
for
a
moment
the
state
trooper
looked
after
the
runaway
horses
there
was
no
use
following
they
have
to
run
till
they
dropped
then
he
lowered
the
levelled
rifle
from
his
shoulder
looked
grimly
at
the
limp
thing
which
had
tumbled
from
the
sledge
into
the
snowy
road
and
which
sprawled
there
crimsoning
