the
tale
of
jolly
robin
i
nestlings
of
course
there
was
a
time
once
when
jolly
robin
was
just
a
nestling
himself
with
two
brothers
and
one
sister
all
of
them
like
him
much
spotted
with
black
he
lived
in
a
house
in
one
of
farmer
green
apple
trees
the
house
was
made
of
grass
and
leaves
plastered
on
the
inside
with
mud
and
lined
with
softer
finer
grass
which
his
mother
had
chosen
with
the
greatest
care
but
jolly
never
paid
much
attention
to
his
first
home
what
interested
him
more
than
anything
else
was
food
from
dawn
till
dark
he
was
always
for
something
to
eat
and
since
the
other
children
were
just
as
hungry
as
he
was
those
four
growing
babies
kept
their
parents
busy
finding
food
for
them
it
was
then
that
jolly
robin
learned
to
like
angleworms
and
though
he
ate
greedily
of
insects
and
bugs
as
well
as
wild
berries
he
liked
angleworms
best
jolly
and
his
sister
and
his
brothers
could
always
tell
when
their
father
or
their
mother
brought
home
some
dainty
because
the
moment
the
parent
lighted
upon
the
limb
where
the
nest
was
built
they
could
feel
their
home
sink
slightly
from
the
added
weight
upon
the
branch
then
the
youngsters
would
set
up
a
loud
squalling
with
a
great
craning
of
necks
and
stretching
of
mouths
sometimes
when
the
dainty
was
specially
big
or
robin
would
say
cuck
that
meant
open
wide
but
they
seldom
found
it
necessary
to
give
that
order
somehow
jolly
robin
managed
to
eat
more
than
the
rest
of
the
nestlings
and
so
he
grew
faster
than
the
others
he
soon
learned
a
few
tricks
too
for
instance
if
robin
happened
to
be
sitting
on
the
nest
to
keep
her
family
warm
when
robin
returned
with
a
lunch
for
the
children
jolly
had
a
trick
that
he
played
on
his
mother
in
case
she
did
move
off
the
nest
fast
enough
to
suit
him
he
would
whisper
to
the
rest
of
the
children
and
then
they
would
jostle
their
fond
parent
lifting
her
up
above
them
and
sometimes
almost
upsetting
her
so
that
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
from
falling
off
the
nest
robin
did
not
like
that
trick
very
well
but
she
knew
that
jolly
would
not
annoy
her
with
it
long
indeed
he
was
only
eleven
days
old
when
he
left
his
birthplace
and
went
out
into
the
wide
world
you
see
the
young
folk
grew
so
fast
that
they
soon
more
than
filled
the
house
so
there
was
nothing
their
parents
could
do
but
persuade
them
to
leave
home
and
learn
to
fly
one
day
therefore
robin
did
not
bring
his
children
food
to
the
edge
of
the
nest
and
drop
it
into
their
mouths
instead
he
stood
on
the
limb
a
little
distance
away
from
them
and
showed
them
a
plump
angleworm
the
sight
of
that
dainty
was
more
than
jolly
robin
could
resist
he
scrambled
boldly
out
of
the
nest
and
tottering
up
to
his
father
on
his
wobbling
legs
he
snatched
the
tempting
morsel
out
of
his
proud
parent
bill
jolly
never
went
back
to
the
nest
after
that
the
next
day
robin
coaxed
the
other
children
from
home
in
the
same
fashion
and
though
it
may
seem
a
heartless
act
it
was
really
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
jolly
and
his
sister
and
his
brothers
you
see
they
had
to
learn
to
fly
and
so
long
as
they
stayed
in
the
nest
they
could
never
learn
a
difficult
feat
like
flying
ii
learning
to
fly
after
jolly
robin
had
gulped
down
the
fat
angleworm
with
which
his
father
had
coaxed
him
to
leave
the
nest
he
clung
desperately
to
the
limb
with
no
food
in
sight
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
look
about
him
and
to
be
alarmed
the
day
was
not
gone
before
he
had
a
great
fright
he
tumbled
out
of
the
apple
tree
and
fell
squawking
and
fluttering
upon
the
ground
luckily
his
mother
happened
to
be
at
home
she
went
to
jolly
at
once
and
told
him
not
to
be
afraid
nothing
will
hurt
you
she
said
if
you
only
keep
still
but
if
you
squall
like
that
the
cat
will
find
you
it
may
seem
strange
but
his
mother
words
frightened
jolly
all
the
more
they
scared
him
so
thoroughly
that
he
stopped
making
a
noise
anyhow
and
that
was
how
he
learned
never
to
talk
when
he
was
on
the
ground
near
a
house
where
a
cat
might
live
now
said
jolly
mother
as
soon
as
he
was
still
i
teach
you
a
new
game
just
watch
me
and
spreading
her
wings
she
flapped
them
and
sprang
into
the
air
soon
jolly
was
trying
to
imitate
her
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
found
himself
gliding
a
short
distance
skimming
along
just
off
the
ground
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
he
could
help
falling
again
though
his
mother
tried
to
show
him
how
to
fly
into
a
jolly
robin
seemed
unable
to
learn
the
trick
at
last
robin
said
to
his
wife
i
teach
him
the
rest
you
made
a
good
beginning
but
he
must
learn
more
at
once
there
no
telling
when
the
cat
may
come
into
the
orchard
to
hunt
for
and
you
know
what
would
happen
then
his
wife
shuddered
but
robin
told
her
not
to
worry
i
soon
have
this
youngster
so
he
can
fly
as
well
as
anybody
he
declared
so
he
went
and
hopped
about
on
the
ground
with
jolly
for
a
little
while
showing
him
how
to
find
worms
beneath
the
grass
carpet
of
the
orchard
and
then
in
a
loud
voice
robin
suddenly
cried
the
cat
the
cat
and
he
flew
into
an
old
tree
jolly
robin
had
never
seen
farmer
green
cat
but
he
had
heard
that
she
was
a
dreadful
fierce
creature
and
when
his
father
shouted
her
name
jolly
was
so
startled
that
he
forgot
he
did
quite
know
how
to
fly
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
followed
his
father
right
up
into
the
old
apple
tree
and
perched
himself
on
a
low
branch
that
was
the
way
he
learned
to
fly
for
he
never
had
the
least
trouble
about
it
afterward
and
as
soon
as
he
realized
that
he
had
actually
flown
from
the
ground
to
the
bough
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
began
to
laugh
merrily
as
for
the
cat
she
was
not
in
the
orchard
at
all
indeed
father
had
not
said
that
she
was
you
see
he
had
played
a
joke
on
his
son
now
up
to
that
time
jolly
robin
had
not
been
named
you
must
remember
that
he
was
not
two
weeks
old
and
having
three
other
children
of
the
same
age
his
parents
had
not
been
able
to
think
of
names
for
all
of
them
but
this
big
youngster
laughed
so
heartily
that
his
father
named
him
jolly
on
the
spot
and
jolly
he
remained
ever
afterward
iii
the
wide
wide
world
after
he
learned
to
fly
jolly
robin
father
took
him
into
the
woods
to
spend
each
night
in
a
roost
where
there
were
many
other
young
robins
whose
fathers
had
likewise
brought
them
there
jolly
learned
a
great
deal
from
being
with
so
many
new
friends
it
was
not
long
before
he
could
find
plenty
of
food
for
himself
without
help
from
anyone
he
discovered
too
that
there
was
safety
in
numbers
for
example
if
jasper
jay
made
too
great
a
nuisance
of
himself
by
bullying
a
young
robin
a
mob
of
robins
could
easily
put
jasper
to
flight
help
other
people
that
was
a
motto
that
all
the
youngsters
had
to
learn
and
another
was
this
your
father
lead
later
in
the
season
in
october
when
the
robin
cousins
and
uncles
and
aunts
and
sisters
and
brothers
and
all
the
rest
of
the
relations
made
their
long
journey
to
their
winter
homes
in
the
south
jolly
found
that
there
was
a
good
reason
for
such
rules
if
he
had
followed
his
father
then
he
might
have
lost
his
way
because
since
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
out
of
pleasant
valley
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
travelling
he
looked
forward
with
much
interest
to
the
journey
for
as
the
days
grew
shorter
he
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
trip
among
his
elders
and
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
day
when
they
should
leave
he
became
acquainted
with
many
new
and
delicious
morsels
to
eat
he
roamed
about
picking
wild
grapes
mulberries
and
elderberries
and
he
did
not
scorn
a
large
green
katydid
when
he
chanced
to
find
one
there
was
always
some
new
dainty
to
be
sampled
though
as
the
weather
grew
colder
jolly
began
to
understand
that
in
winter
pleasant
valley
would
not
be
so
fine
a
place
to
live
however
he
managed
to
find
food
enough
so
that
he
continued
to
grow
rapidly
the
night
after
he
found
a
mountain
ash
on
a
hillside
full
of
bright
red
berries
his
father
said
that
he
seemed
much
taller
than
he
had
been
that
morning
you
must
have
eaten
a
great
many
of
those
berries
said
robin
well
i
notice
one
thing
jolly
observed
my
waistcoat
is
fast
losing
its
black
spots
and
it
redder
than
it
was
the
red
berries
certainly
colored
it
in
some
way
robin
replied
that
he
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
happening
he
looked
curiously
at
his
son
waistcoat
it
seem
to
look
different
he
said
it
brighter
than
it
was
really
that
was
only
because
jolly
was
fast
growing
up
but
neither
he
nor
his
father
stopped
to
think
of
that
and
since
jolly
had
learned
that
motto
your
father
he
thought
his
waistcoat
ought
to
be
just
as
red
as
old
robin
was
so
jolly
visited
the
mountain
ash
each
day
and
fairly
stuffed
himself
with
the
bright
red
fruit
it
did
him
no
harm
anyhow
and
he
enjoyed
eating
it
and
the
next
spring
when
jolly
robin
returned
to
pleasant
valley
after
spending
the
winter
in
the
south
there
was
not
a
redder
waistcoat
than
his
in
all
the
neighborhood
iv
what
jolly
did
best
jolly
robin
had
something
on
his
mind
for
several
days
he
had
been
turning
a
certain
matter
over
in
his
head
but
in
spite
of
all
his
thinking
he
seemed
unable
to
find
any
answer
to
the
question
that
was
troubling
him
so
at
last
he
decided
he
would
have
to
ask
somebody
to
help
him
and
that
was
why
jolly
stopped
jimmy
rabbit
near
the
garden
one
day
i
want
your
advice
he
told
jimmy
rabbit
certainly
that
young
gentleman
replied
and
he
sat
himself
down
upon
his
wheelbarrow
and
looked
very
earnest
if
it
anything
about
gardening
he
said
i
should
advise
you
to
raise
cabbages
by
all
means
but
jolly
robin
said
he
was
thinking
of
planting
a
garden
in
fact
he
explained
the
trouble
is
i
do
know
what
to
do
like
to
have
some
regular
work
you
know
and
since
you
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
having
run
a
parlor
a
and
a
i
thought
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
what
would
be
a
good
business
for
me
to
take
up
for
a
few
minutes
jimmy
rabbit
did
not
speak
but
he
nodded
his
head
wisely
let
me
see
he
said
at
last
what
the
thing
you
do
best
jolly
robin
replied
at
once
that
he
thought
he
could
fly
better
than
he
could
do
anything
else
and
he
felt
so
happy
because
he
was
sure
jimmy
rabbit
was
going
to
help
him
that
he
began
to
laugh
gaily
and
he
could
help
singing
a
snatch
of
a
new
song
he
had
heard
that
morning
and
then
he
laughed
again
you
mistaken
jimmy
rabbit
said
to
him
you
fly
well
enough
i
dare
say
but
there
are
others
who
can
beat
you
at
flying
no
he
declared
what
you
can
do
better
than
anybody
i
know
is
to
and
if
i
were
you
i
should
make
laughing
my
regular
business
that
idea
struck
jolly
robin
as
being
so
funny
that
he
laughed
harder
than
ever
and
jimmy
rabbit
nodded
his
head
again
as
if
to
say
right
and
i
know
it
at
last
jolly
robin
stopped
laughing
long
enough
to
ask
jimmy
to
explain
how
anyone
could
make
a
business
of
laughing
i
do
see
how
it
could
be
done
said
jolly
robin
why
it
simple
enough
jimmy
told
him
all
you
need
do
is
to
find
somebody
who
will
hire
you
to
laugh
for
him
there
are
people
you
know
who
find
it
very
difficult
to
laugh
i
should
think
they
be
glad
to
pay
somebody
to
do
their
laughing
for
them
name
someone
jolly
robin
urged
him
and
jimmy
rabbit
did
there
old
mr
crow
he
said
you
know
how
solemn
he
is
positively
painful
to
hear
him
try
to
laugh
at
a
joke
i
sure
he
would
be
delighted
with
this
idea
and
if
i
were
you
i
see
him
before
somebody
else
does
jolly
robin
looked
puzzled
who
would
ever
think
of
such
a
thing
but
you
he
asked
nobody
jimmy
rabbit
replied
but
i
like
the
scheme
so
well
that
i
almost
wish
i
had
mentioned
it
and
unless
you
make
your
bargain
with
old
crow
at
once
i
may
decide
to
go
into
the
laughing
business
myself
my
advice
to
you
he
said
is
to
hurry
so
jolly
robin
thanked
him
and
then
he
flew
away
to
find
old
crow
of
course
he
went
to
the
cornfield
first
v
laughing
for
crow
sure
enough
old
crow
was
in
the
cornfield
and
though
he
was
feeling
somewhat
peevish
that
morning
because
a
coon
had
disturbed
his
rest
the
night
before
he
listened
to
what
jolly
robin
had
to
say
i
come
to
ask
you
a
question
jolly
told
him
i
decided
to
go
into
business
the
laughing
business
and
i
want
to
inquire
if
you
would
like
to
engage
me
to
do
your
laughing
for
you
well
that
struck
old
crow
as
being
very
funny
he
forgot
all
about
his
loss
of
sleep
and
his
eye
twinkled
quite
merrily
he
tried
to
laugh
too
but
it
was
a
pitiful
attempt
no
more
than
a
hoarse
cackle
which
was
as
jimmy
rabbit
had
said
positively
painful
old
crow
seemed
to
realize
that
he
was
making
a
very
queer
sound
he
hastily
turned
his
laugh
into
a
cough
and
pretended
that
he
had
a
kernel
of
corn
stuck
in
his
throat
what
are
your
prices
he
asked
jolly
robin
are
you
going
to
charge
by
the
day
or
by
the
laugh
just
as
you
prefer
jolly
answered
well
i
have
to
think
about
it
old
crow
told
him
it
a
question
that
i
would
care
to
decide
in
a
hurry
if
i
paid
you
by
the
day
you
might
not
laugh
at
all
and
if
i
paid
you
by
the
laugh
you
might
laugh
all
the
time
it
would
be
pretty
expensive
either
way
and
i
do
believe
i
like
that
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
jolly
robin
then
i
stay
with
you
one
day
for
nothing
and
we
see
how
the
arrangement
suits
us
that
suggestion
pleased
crow
agreed
he
said
quickly
and
now
he
added
you
may
laugh
for
me
because
i
am
quite
delighted
so
jolly
robin
laughed
happily
and
old
crow
remarked
that
it
was
a
laugh
though
not
so
loud
as
he
would
have
liked
i
do
better
next
time
jolly
assured
him
good
said
crow
and
now
since
i
finished
my
breakfast
we
go
over
to
the
woods
and
see
what
going
on
there
this
morning
the
first
person
they
saw
in
the
woods
was
peter
mink
he
was
fishing
for
trout
in
broad
brook
and
old
crow
as
soon
as
he
spied
him
sang
out
how
many
of
farmer
green
fish
have
you
eaten
this
morning
peter
mink
was
just
crawling
out
of
the
water
with
a
fish
in
his
mouth
when
he
heard
crow
calling
to
him
he
dropped
his
trout
upon
a
rock
and
looked
up
quickly
how
much
of
farmer
green
corn
have
you
stolen
for
your
breakfast
he
cried
at
that
jolly
robin
began
to
laugh
but
crow
stopped
him
quickly
do
laugh
the
old
gentleman
squawked
there
nothing
to
laugh
at
so
far
as
i
can
see
so
jolly
managed
to
smother
his
laughter
for
he
noticed
that
crow
was
angry
you
have
to
be
careful
crow
warned
him
you
must
laugh
at
the
wrong
time
you
know
i
do
my
best
jolly
robin
promised
and
he
could
see
already
that
old
crow
was
going
to
be
hard
to
please
vi
tickling
a
nose
old
crow
did
not
want
to
stay
near
the
brook
to
talk
with
peter
mink
calling
to
jolly
robin
to
follow
him
he
flapped
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
sat
in
a
tree
overlooking
the
pasture
here
comes
tommy
fox
crow
exclaimed
we
ought
to
have
some
fun
with
him
so
when
it
time
for
you
to
laugh
for
me
do
forget
to
laugh
loudly
i
remember
jolly
promised
him
and
just
by
way
of
practice
he
chirruped
so
merrily
that
tommy
fox
pricked
up
his
ears
and
came
bounding
up
to
the
tree
where
jolly
and
crow
were
sitting
good
morning
crow
cried
to
tommy
is
that
a
hen
feather
that
stuck
behind
your
ear
he
asked
very
solemnly
no
said
tommy
fox
it
a
crow
and
i
certainly
had
a
fine
breakfast
now
jolly
robin
was
quite
sure
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
not
and
then
tommy
winked
at
him
so
jolly
thought
there
must
be
a
joke
somewhere
and
he
began
to
chirrup
as
loudly
as
he
could
for
pity
sake
keep
still
old
crow
snapped
but
you
wanted
me
to
laugh
louder
jolly
reminded
him
yes
said
crow
when
there
anything
to
laugh
at
but
did
tommy
fox
make
a
joke
jolly
robin
asked
a
very
poor
one
old
crow
replied
a
very
poor
joke
indeed
i
see
he
added
i
see
you
not
had
much
experience
laughing
for
people
and
here
where
you
make
a
mistake
you
laugh
at
jokes
which
is
all
wrong
after
this
you
must
laugh
at
jokes
do
you
understand
jolly
robin
said
he
understood
and
crow
remarked
that
he
was
glad
there
would
be
no
more
trouble
and
now
the
old
fellow
said
now
we
go
over
to
the
swamp
where
uncle
sammy
coon
lives
we
ought
to
have
some
fun
with
him
so
over
to
the
swamp
they
flew
where
they
found
uncle
sammy
coon
sunning
himself
in
the
top
of
a
tall
hemlock
said
crow
but
uncle
sammy
coon
did
not
answer
we
in
luck
crow
said
with
a
chuckle
i
declare
i
believe
the
old
beggar
asleep
just
watch
me
play
a
practical
joke
on
him
so
crow
lighted
on
a
branch
near
uncle
sammy
coon
and
began
tickling
his
nose
pretty
soon
uncle
sammy
coon
sneezed
and
when
that
happened
crow
jumped
back
quickly
but
uncle
sammy
did
awake
at
least
he
open
his
eyes
so
crow
tickled
his
nose
again
now
old
crow
was
so
amused
that
he
glanced
at
jolly
robin
to
see
if
he
was
watching
and
in
that
instant
when
crow
looked
away
uncle
sammy
coon
leaped
at
him
he
caught
crow
by
the
tail
too
the
old
gentleman
set
up
a
great
din
he
squawked
help
help
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
flapped
his
broad
wings
the
struggle
was
over
in
a
moment
by
a
great
effort
crow
broke
away
leaving
one
of
his
with
uncle
sammy
coon
and
flew
into
another
tree
then
jolly
robin
laughed
as
if
he
would
never
stop
he
thought
that
it
must
be
the
proper
time
to
laugh
because
crow
had
said
he
was
going
to
play
a
joke
on
uncle
sammy
crow
however
seemed
to
think
differently
about
the
matter
do
keep
quiet
he
cried
there
nothing
to
laugh
at
so
far
as
i
can
see
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
play
a
joke
on
uncle
sammy
coon
did
you
jolly
inquired
yes
crow
replied
but
it
no
joke
to
lose
a
and
i
would
think
of
laughing
at
what
just
happened
besides
he
continued
your
laughter
is
altogether
wrong
what
you
must
try
to
do
is
to
laugh
in
fact
he
added
i
would
mind
if
you
shed
a
few
tears
because
i
feel
quite
upset
over
this
unfortunate
accident
well
jolly
robin
saw
at
once
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
please
crow
my
laughter
he
said
is
always
merry
i
could
laugh
sadly
no
matter
how
hard
i
might
try
and
as
for
shedding
tears
i
weep
for
you
even
if
you
lost
all
your
mr
crow
then
you
may
leave
at
once
crow
cried
just
as
if
farmer
green
pasture
belonged
to
him
yes
jolly
robin
answered
i
may
and
then
again
i
may
not
and
since
he
stayed
right
there
and
laughed
old
crow
himself
flew
away
it
was
a
long
while
too
before
he
could
bear
to
hear
people
laugh
for
he
thought
they
must
be
laughing
at
him
because
he
had
lost
a
and
perhaps
that
was
what
amused
jolly
robin
though
i
never
thought
of
that
before
vii
a
new
way
to
travel
the
time
had
come
when
jolly
robin
was
ready
to
begin
his
long
journey
to
the
south
for
it
was
growing
quite
cold
on
some
days
there
was
no
sun
at
all
and
even
when
the
weather
was
fair
the
sun
rose
late
and
went
to
bed
early
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
weather
jolly
robin
did
not
like
no
doubt
you
be
leaving
us
soon
jasper
jay
remarked
to
jolly
one
day
when
the
two
chanced
to
meet
in
farmer
green
woods
where
the
beeches
grew
i
expect
to
start
jolly
robin
answered
with
a
short
laugh
the
mere
thought
of
his
warm
winter
home
in
the
southland
made
him
feel
glad
well
well
jasper
jay
exclaimed
i
glad
i
happened
to
see
you
for
i
know
of
a
new
way
to
travel
and
jolly
robin
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
if
it
a
better
way
than
the
old
i
be
pleased
to
try
it
he
said
oh
it
much
better
jasper
told
him
if
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
spend
the
winter
in
pleasant
valley
i
go
the
new
way
myself
but
the
beechnut
crop
is
good
this
fall
so
i
shall
stay
right
here
to
enjoy
it
tell
me
how
we
to
go
if
you
please
jolly
robin
urged
him
we
said
jasper
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
going
with
a
do
you
why
yes
jolly
robin
replied
all
the
robins
are
leaving
and
i
had
intended
to
go
with
them
jasper
jay
shook
his
head
take
my
advice
and
do
do
any
such
thing
he
said
you
find
it
quieter
travelling
alone
and
though
you
may
not
know
it
it
the
fashionable
thing
to
do
jolly
robin
laughed
when
jasper
said
that
but
i
not
a
fashionable
person
he
exclaimed
then
you
should
become
one
jasper
told
him
besides
the
new
way
is
as
well
as
more
stylish
but
if
you
to
try
something
new
of
course
i
would
think
of
urging
you
i
not
afraid
jolly
robin
cried
and
if
you
only
tell
me
what
i
to
do
i
promise
you
i
do
it
good
said
jasper
jay
meet
me
here
day
after
and
start
you
on
your
journey
i
ca
explain
anything
now
because
i
must
hurry
over
to
the
woods
at
once
where
my
cousin
crow
is
waiting
for
me
then
he
flew
away
screaming
a
loud
as
he
went
so
jolly
robin
hastened
back
to
the
orchard
to
find
his
wife
and
tell
her
what
he
had
decided
to
do
he
had
no
difficulty
at
all
in
finding
her
but
he
had
no
end
of
trouble
trying
to
persuade
her
to
travel
with
him
the
new
way
instead
of
going
along
with
the
crowd
in
the
good
style
in
fact
she
raised
so
many
objections
saying
how
lonely
it
would
be
and
how
dangerous
it
was
to
travel
in
a
small
party
and
that
she
want
to
be
fashionable
she
raised
so
many
objections
that
at
last
jolly
robin
said
very
well
she
might
do
as
she
pleased
but
as
for
him
was
going
to
meet
jasper
jay
just
as
he
had
promised
and
since
the
new
way
was
easier
he
expected
to
reach
their
winter
home
long
before
she
arrived
even
if
he
did
start
a
day
later
but
he
was
disappointed
all
the
same
and
he
kept
up
such
a
constant
laughing
and
joking
all
the
rest
of
that
day
that
his
wife
knew
he
must
be
feeling
quite
out
of
sorts
for
that
was
a
way
jolly
robin
had
the
worse
he
felt
the
happier
he
always
acted
and
it
was
not
a
bad
way
either
viii
jolly
is
left
behind
all
of
jolly
robin
friends
and
relations
were
greatly
surprised
when
they
saw
him
bidding
his
wife
and
children
on
the
day
the
robin
family
started
from
pleasant
valley
for
their
winter
home
in
the
south
what
this
they
cried
are
you
coming
with
us
and
jolly
robin
laughed
and
said
to
them
gaily
not
but
you
find
me
waiting
for
you
when
you
reach
your
journey
end
his
wife
however
shook
her
head
it
one
of
his
queer
notions
his
and
jasper
jay
she
explained
tut
tut
her
husband
said
and
he
chucked
her
under
the
chin
and
winked
at
his
friends
there
was
no
time
to
say
anything
more
for
everyone
was
eager
to
start
so
the
travellers
called
to
jolly
while
he
waved
a
farewell
to
them
it
was
not
many
minutes
before
he
was
the
only
member
of
the
robin
family
left
in
pleasant
valley
he
felt
very
lonely
all
at
once
and
he
wanted
to
hurry
after
the
others
but
he
knew
what
jasper
jay
would
say
if
he
did
jasper
would
be
sure
to
tell
people
that
jolly
robin
was
to
travel
a
new
way
of
course
jolly
did
want
that
to
be
said
about
him
so
he
looked
as
cheerful
as
he
could
and
he
whistled
the
merriest
tune
he
knew
nobody
except
his
wife
maybe
would
have
guessed
that
he
was
perfectly
happy
jolly
spent
a
very
lonely
night
when
he
went
to
the
roost
where
the
whole
robin
family
had
been
sleeping
for
several
weeks
he
found
it
distressingly
silent
after
the
gay
chatter
that
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
hearing
there
and
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
keep
just
a
hint
of
sadness
out
of
his
song
but
in
the
morning
he
felt
better
and
he
welcomed
the
dawn
with
a
carol
that
was
joyous
enough
for
anybody
for
this
was
the
day
when
jasper
jay
was
going
to
show
him
the
new
way
to
travel
yes
he
too
would
soon
be
hurrying
southwards
where
the
sun
was
warm
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
sang
right
merrily
as
soon
as
he
had
eaten
his
breakfast
jolly
went
to
the
place
where
the
beeches
grew
to
find
jasper
jay
and
jasper
was
there
just
finishing
his
own
breakfast
but
he
was
too
busy
he
said
to
bother
with
jolly
robin
just
then
you
meet
me
in
the
orchard
this
afternoon
he
said
when
the
over
the
mountain
and
i
start
you
on
your
journey
so
jolly
robin
had
to
wait
all
the
long
day
while
jasper
jay
did
a
hundred
silly
things
such
as
mocking
farmer
green
cat
and
teasing
a
sleepy
young
owl
and
making
the
woods
echo
with
his
hoarse
screams
jasper
was
late
too
in
keeping
his
appointment
in
the
orchard
jolly
robin
waited
for
him
until
almost
sunset
before
jasper
jay
appeared
but
jolly
was
so
glad
to
see
jasper
that
he
never
once
thought
of
being
angry
with
him
come
along
said
the
rascal
follow
me
and
you
soon
learn
the
new
way
to
the
south
and
if
it
is
a
good
one
i
hope
never
eat
another
beechnut
jolly
robin
laughed
he
was
sure
then
that
he
had
nothing
to
worry
about
for
everybody
knew
that
jasper
jay
was
specially
fond
of
beechnuts
ix
jolly
mistake
with
jolly
robin
following
close
behind
him
jasper
jay
flew
directly
to
the
crossroads
almost
to
the
village
once
there
he
perched
himself
upon
the
at
the
four
corners
and
jolly
robin
seated
himself
upon
one
of
the
boards
that
were
nailed
to
the
post
here
we
are
said
jasper
jay
you
see
how
easy
it
is
when
will
the
post
begin
to
move
jolly
robin
inquired
a
bit
anxiously
he
had
waited
a
whole
day
to
begin
his
long
journey
to
the
south
so
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
want
to
start
at
once
what
that
you
say
asked
jasper
jay
and
when
jolly
repeated
his
question
jasper
began
to
scream
with
laughter
well
that
a
good
one
he
said
at
last
so
you
thought
the
post
was
going
to
pull
itself
out
of
the
ground
and
fly
away
with
you
did
you
why
yes
jolly
robin
replied
are
these
he
asked
looking
down
at
the
boards
they
already
spread
he
observed
it
was
some
minutes
before
jasper
jay
could
answer
him
for
he
was
laughing
again
but
finally
he
managed
to
speak
those
are
wings
he
cried
they
to
tell
you
which
road
to
take
of
course
you
ca
expect
to
read
a
sign
when
you
sitting
on
it
just
go
over
to
the
fence
across
the
road
and
you
can
see
the
sign
that
you
on
now
so
jolly
robin
fluttered
over
to
the
fence
and
from
there
he
could
see
the
plainly
this
is
what
it
looked
like
to
sky
pond
miles
there
jasper
jay
cried
when
jolly
had
read
the
sign
aloud
you
see
how
easy
it
is
all
you
need
do
is
to
follow
this
road
to
which
the
hand
points
then
i
shall
have
to
fly
after
all
jolly
robin
said
he
had
expected
to
have
a
ride
and
naturally
he
was
disappointed
then
he
read
the
sign
once
more
sky
pond
he
exclaimed
i
do
want
to
go
to
sky
pond
i
want
to
go
to
the
south
well
sky
pond
south
of
pleasant
valley
jasper
jay
explained
it
right
on
your
way
to
your
winter
home
and
all
you
have
to
do
when
you
reach
sky
pond
will
be
to
find
another
sign
which
ought
to
say
something
like
this
the
south
one
thousand
miles
you
see
how
simple
it
is
jasper
jay
remarked
with
a
to
guide
you
you
ca
go
wrong
but
it
seemed
to
jolly
that
the
new
way
of
travelling
was
far
more
difficult
than
the
old
he
said
as
much
to
jasper
jay
too
i
wish
he
added
i
wish
i
had
started
yesterday
with
the
others
at
that
jasper
jay
said
nonsense
and
he
muttered
something
about
dunces
and
mollycoddles
and
yes
perhaps
jasper
had
intended
that
jolly
robin
should
hear
those
words
and
perhaps
he
had
anyhow
he
was
sorry
afterward
that
he
had
spoken
so
loud
for
the
first
thing
he
knew
jolly
robin
flew
straight
at
him
with
shrill
chirps
of
rage
and
jasper
was
so
surprised
and
frightened
too
that
he
flew
off
as
fast
as
he
could
go
following
the
road
that
led
to
sky
pond
fifteen
miles
away
with
jolly
robin
after
him
jolly
chased
him
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
jasper
jay
swerved
to
one
side
and
turned
toward
home
but
jolly
robin
followed
him
no
longer
he
kept
straight
on
and
on
and
on
and
he
flew
so
fast
and
so
far
before
he
stopped
that
he
overtook
the
party
that
had
started
a
whole
day
ahead
of
him
so
he
travelled
to
his
winter
home
in
the
way
after
all
and
though
jolly
robin
laughed
when
he
told
his
friends
about
jasper
jay
new
style
of
travelling
there
was
one
thing
over
which
he
could
not
smile
even
then
you
see
was
a
name
he
could
abide
x
the
white
giant
it
was
a
raw
march
day
when
jolly
robin
returned
to
pleasant
valley
one
spring
there
had
just
been
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
big
wet
flakes
which
farmer
green
called
though
it
was
no
sweeter
than
any
other
johnnie
green
liked
that
kind
of
snow
because
it
made
the
best
snowballs
and
he
had
had
a
fine
time
playing
in
the
orchard
near
the
farmhouse
not
long
before
jolly
robin
appeared
there
now
the
orchard
was
the
place
where
jolly
robin
and
his
wife
had
had
their
nest
the
summer
before
so
it
was
natural
that
he
should
want
to
go
there
at
once
and
look
about
a
bit
he
perched
himself
on
a
bare
limb
where
he
sang
a
few
times
in
spite
of
the
snow
and
the
cold
whistling
wind
he
knew
that
the
weather
would
grow
warmer
soon
and
he
was
glad
to
be
in
pleasant
valley
once
more
though
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
liked
the
orchard
better
when
the
grass
was
green
and
the
trees
were
gay
with
it
really
a
beautiful
place
for
a
home
he
told
himself
i
wonder
that
farmer
green
likes
to
live
near
the
orchard
and
now
just
go
over
to
the
house
and
see
if
i
ca
get
a
peep
at
him
and
his
wife
and
his
boy
johnnie
and
the
too
so
jolly
robin
jumped
off
the
bough
and
started
through
the
frosty
air
toward
the
farmhouse
but
all
at
once
he
saw
a
sight
that
sent
him
darting
into
a
tree
he
hid
there
for
a
while
and
something
made
him
shiver
something
besides
the
cold
wind
yes
jolly
robin
was
the
least
bit
frightened
for
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
strange
man
it
was
neither
farmer
green
nor
his
for
this
was
a
giant
he
had
big
black
eyes
and
a
great
lump
of
a
nose
which
stuck
out
queerly
from
his
pale
he
was
dressed
all
in
white
except
for
a
battered
old
black
hat
which
he
wore
tipped
over
one
eye
in
one
hand
he
held
a
stick
and
it
seemed
to
jolly
robin
that
the
queer
man
was
just
about
to
hurl
it
at
something
in
spite
of
his
uneasiness
jolly
peeped
around
his
tree
and
watched
the
stranger
but
he
did
not
throw
the
stick
he
stood
quite
still
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
and
jolly
robin
waited
too
and
stared
at
him
maybe
there
a
squirrel
hiding
behind
a
tree
he
said
to
himself
perhaps
this
man
in
white
is
going
to
throw
the
stick
as
soon
as
the
squirrel
shows
himself
but
no
squirrel
appeared
and
jolly
robin
was
just
about
to
start
for
the
farmhouse
again
when
he
saw
somebody
pop
out
of
the
woodshed
door
and
come
running
toward
the
orchard
here
johnnie
green
jolly
exclaimed
he
knew
johnnie
at
once
because
neither
farmer
green
nor
the
ever
went
hopping
and
skipping
about
like
that
pretty
soon
jolly
saw
johnnie
green
stop
and
make
an
armful
of
snowballs
and
then
he
went
straight
toward
the
stranger
in
white
though
johnnie
began
to
shout
the
man
in
white
did
not
even
turn
his
head
and
then
johnnie
green
shied
a
snowball
at
him
the
snowball
sailed
through
the
air
and
struck
the
stranger
battered
hat
knocking
it
off
into
the
snow
and
of
course
jolly
robin
could
help
laughing
he
was
more
surprised
than
ever
too
because
the
man
did
not
move
even
then
anyone
else
would
have
wheeled
about
and
chased
johnnie
green
but
this
odd
gentleman
seem
to
know
that
his
hat
had
been
knocked
off
that
queer
said
jolly
robin
to
himself
he
must
be
asleep
but
i
should
think
he
would
wake
up
while
jolly
was
wondering
johnnie
green
threw
another
snowball
and
when
it
struck
the
stranger
a
very
peculiar
thing
happened
and
jolly
robin
did
not
laugh
he
was
too
frightened
to
do
anything
but
gasp
xi
what
a
snowball
did
jolly
robin
was
too
frightened
to
laugh
when
he
saw
johnnie
second
snowball
strike
the
stranger
in
the
orchard
you
see
the
snowball
hit
one
of
the
stranger
arms
and
to
amazement
the
arm
at
once
dropped
off
and
dashed
upon
the
ground
breaking
into
a
dozen
pieces
that
alone
was
enough
to
startle
jolly
robin
but
the
man
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
accident
there
was
something
ghostly
in
the
way
he
stood
there
all
in
white
never
moving
never
once
saying
a
word
but
johnnie
green
did
not
seem
frightened
at
all
he
set
up
a
great
shouting
and
began
to
let
fly
his
snowballs
as
fast
as
he
could
throw
them
they
did
not
all
find
the
mark
but
the
very
last
one
struck
the
silent
stranger
squarely
upon
his
left
ear
and
to
jolly
horror
his
head
toppled
off
and
fell
horridly
at
his
feet
jolly
robin
fully
expected
the
man
in
white
to
turn
and
chase
johnnie
green
then
or
at
least
to
hurl
his
stick
at
johnnie
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
and
jolly
did
not
wait
for
anything
more
he
felt
that
he
had
seen
quite
enough
so
he
flew
away
to
the
shelter
of
the
woods
to
find
somebody
to
whom
he
could
talk
and
tell
of
the
strange
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
orchard
over
in
the
woods
jolly
was
lucky
enough
to
meet
jimmy
rabbit
who
was
always
very
friendly
toward
him
and
as
soon
as
he
had
inquired
about
jimmy
rabbit
health
they
had
not
seen
each
other
since
the
previous
fall
you
know
jolly
related
how
he
had
seen
johnnie
green
knock
off
the
head
of
the
man
in
the
orchard
and
the
man
never
paid
the
slightest
heed
to
what
happened
said
jolly
robin
he
had
a
stick
in
his
hand
but
he
did
throw
it
there
nothing
queer
about
that
jimmy
rabbit
remarked
how
could
he
see
where
to
throw
his
stick
when
he
had
no
head
but
jolly
robin
could
not
answer
that
question
and
he
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
i
do
understand
it
he
said
with
a
shake
of
his
own
head
the
whole
affair
was
very
odd
i
afraid
i
shall
not
care
to
live
in
the
orchard
this
summer
especially
if
there
a
headless
man
there
for
how
can
he
ever
see
to
leave
the
orchard
it
was
jimmy
rabbit
turn
to
look
puzzled
for
that
was
a
question
that
he
could
answer
maybe
there
is
something
queer
about
this
case
he
said
i
go
over
to
the
orchard
and
take
a
look
at
that
headless
stranger
and
see
what
i
think
about
him
if
you
meet
me
here
we
can
go
together
now
jolly
robin
had
almost
decided
that
he
would
never
go
near
the
orchard
again
but
he
felt
that
if
he
went
with
jimmy
rabbit
there
ought
not
to
be
much
danger
so
he
agreed
to
jimmy
suggestion
i
be
here
before
the
morning
gone
he
promised
xii
jolly
feels
better
jolly
robin
awoke
at
dawn
and
he
knew
at
once
that
the
day
was
going
to
be
a
fine
one
though
the
sun
had
not
yet
peeped
above
the
rim
of
the
eastern
hills
jolly
robin
was
sure
that
there
would
be
plenty
of
sunshine
a
little
later
he
had
many
ways
of
his
own
for
telling
the
weather
and
he
never
made
a
mistake
about
it
now
it
had
grown
quite
warm
by
the
time
jolly
robin
went
to
the
woods
late
in
the
morning
to
meet
jimmy
rabbit
and
the
snow
had
melted
away
as
if
by
magic
summer
coming
summer
coming
jolly
called
joyfully
as
soon
as
jimmy
rabbit
came
hopping
into
sight
the
will
burst
out
before
we
know
it
yes
and
the
cabbages
too
jimmy
rabbit
replied
i
glad
the
white
giant
in
the
orchard
lost
his
head
he
added
because
no
telling
what
he
would
have
done
to
the
cabbages
later
if
he
had
wandered
into
the
garden
he
might
have
eaten
every
one
of
them
and
i
should
have
liked
that
very
well
then
they
started
off
together
toward
the
orchard
to
look
at
the
headless
stranger
who
had
given
jolly
robin
such
a
fright
the
day
before
jimmy
rabbit
went
bounding
along
with
great
leaps
while
jolly
robin
flew
above
him
and
tried
not
to
go
too
fast
for
his
friend
once
in
the
orchard
jolly
led
jimmy
to
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
johnnie
green
knock
off
the
giant
head
with
the
snowball
here
he
is
jolly
robin
whispered
for
he
was
still
somewhat
afraid
of
the
giant
in
spite
of
his
having
lost
his
head
he
does
seem
as
big
as
he
was
yesterday
and
he
has
dropped
the
stick
that
he
carried
jimmy
rabbit
stopped
short
in
his
tracks
and
stared
at
the
still
figure
under
the
apple
tree
for
a
few
moments
he
did
not
speak
that
looks
to
me
like
he
said
at
last
and
he
crept
up
to
what
was
left
of
the
giant
and
sniffed
at
him
it
snow
he
declared
when
he
heard
that
jolly
robin
flew
to
a
low
branch
just
above
the
giant
i
do
understand
it
he
said
there
his
head
on
the
ground
with
the
big
black
eyes
certainly
are
made
of
snow
no
jimmy
rabbit
agreed
as
he
sniffed
at
the
terrible
eyes
they
that
what
they
are
well
jolly
robin
was
so
surprised
that
he
all
but
tumbled
off
his
perch
there
his
hat
he
continued
as
he
clung
to
the
limb
that
a
real
hat
it
not
made
of
snow
or
butternuts
either
yes
jimmy
rabbit
said
it
a
hat
farmer
green
wore
it
on
sundays
for
a
good
many
years
i
often
seen
him
starting
for
the
over
the
hill
with
this
very
hat
on
his
head
then
the
giant
stole
it
from
him
jolly
robin
cried
in
great
excitement
but
jimmy
rabbit
thought
differently
it
my
opinion
he
said
it
my
opinion
that
johnnie
green
took
this
old
hat
and
put
it
on
the
giant
head
after
he
had
made
him
made
him
jolly
robin
repeated
you
do
mean
to
say
that
johnnie
green
could
make
a
giant
do
you
well
he
knows
how
to
make
a
so
i
been
told
jimmy
rabbit
replied
and
though
i
never
seen
one
before
it
plain
that
that
what
this
creature
is
jolly
robin
had
listened
with
growing
wonder
spending
his
winters
in
the
south
as
he
did
he
had
never
even
heard
of
a
are
they
dangerous
these
he
inquired
anxiously
this
one
certainly
is
jimmy
rabbit
told
him
with
his
head
off
he
ca
do
any
harm
and
with
the
sun
shining
so
warm
i
should
say
that
by
he
be
gone
for
good
it
looks
to
me
as
if
he
might
be
the
last
of
the
winter
for
i
do
believe
be
any
more
snow
until
next
fall
good
jolly
robin
cried
i
shall
come
back
to
the
orchard
to
live
after
all
just
as
i
had
intended
and
he
felt
so
happy
that
he
began
to
sing
i
glad
i
brought
you
here
to
see
the
snow
giant
he
told
jimmy
rabbit
when
he
had
finished
his
song
but
when
my
wife
and
i
start
to
build
our
a
little
later
in
the
spring
i
hope
say
nothing
to
her
about
this
affair
it
might
upset
her
you
know
if
she
knew
that
a
giant
lost
his
head
in
the
orchard
even
if
he
was
made
of
snow
i
understand
said
jimmy
rabbit
and
i
wo
mention
the
matter
to
her
you
afraid
she
might
lose
head
i
suppose
if
she
heard
about
it
having
made
a
joke
jimmy
rabbit
thought
it
was
a
good
time
for
him
to
be
leaving
so
he
said
and
hopped
briskly
away
and
jolly
robin
wife
never
knew
that
her
husband
and
jimmy
rabbit
had
a
secret
that
they
did
not
tell
her
of
course
if
they
had
told
her
it
would
have
been
no
secret
at
all
xiii
the
hermit
though
jolly
robin
was
quite
bold
for
his
size
he
had
a
cousin
who
was
actually
shy
this
timid
relation
of
jolly
belonged
to
the
hermit
thrush
family
and
jolly
robin
always
spoke
of
him
as
the
hermit
which
was
a
good
name
for
him
because
he
never
strayed
from
the
depths
of
the
swamp
near
black
creek
at
least
he
stayed
there
all
summer
long
until
the
time
came
for
him
to
go
south
if
jolly
robin
wanted
to
see
this
shy
cousin
he
had
to
go
into
the
swamp
for
the
hermit
never
repaid
any
of
jolly
calls
he
was
afraid
of
farmer
green
and
the
other
people
that
lived
in
the
farmhouse
apple
orchards
and
gardens
and
open
fields
he
considered
good
places
to
avoid
because
he
thought
them
dangerous
there
no
place
to
live
that
quite
as
safe
and
pleasant
as
a
swamp
he
often
remarked
i
have
one
brother
who
prefers
an
evergreen
thicket
which
does
make
a
bad
home
and
another
brother
of
mine
lives
in
some
bushes
near
a
road
but
how
he
can
like
such
a
as
that
is
more
than
i
can
understand
now
there
were
two
things
for
which
this
cousin
of
jolly
robin
was
noted
he
was
an
exquisite
singer
and
he
always
wore
a
fine
spotted
waistcoat
jolly
always
admired
the
hermit
singing
but
he
did
like
his
spotted
waistcoat
at
all
that
cousin
of
mine
is
too
much
of
a
dandy
jolly
remarked
to
his
wife
one
day
i
going
to
pay
him
a
visit
this
afternoon
and
i
shall
speak
to
him
about
that
waistcoat
he
so
fond
of
wearing
well
enough
for
city
birds
to
dress
in
such
finery
but
it
a
foppish
thing
for
anybody
to
wear
way
up
here
in
the
country
jolly
wife
told
him
plainly
that
he
had
better
mind
his
own
business
it
no
affair
of
yours
she
said
and
you
ought
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
your
cousin
jolly
robin
did
not
answer
her
he
thought
there
was
no
use
arguing
with
his
wife
and
since
the
hermit
was
his
own
cousin
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
tell
his
relation
exactly
what
he
thought
the
hermit
appeared
glad
to
see
jolly
robin
when
he
came
to
the
swamp
that
afternoon
at
least
the
hermit
said
he
was
much
pleased
he
had
very
polished
manners
for
a
person
that
lived
in
a
swamp
beside
him
jolly
robin
seemed
somewhat
awkward
and
clownish
but
then
jolly
always
claimed
that
he
was
just
a
plain
countryman
i
never
put
on
any
airs
he
often
said
farmer
green
and
i
are
a
good
deal
alike
in
that
respect
after
the
hermit
had
inquired
about
jolly
health
and
that
of
his
wife
as
well
he
smoothed
down
his
spotted
vest
flicked
a
bit
of
moss
off
his
tail
and
said
that
if
jolly
cared
to
hear
him
he
would
sing
one
of
his
best
songs
i
like
to
hear
you
sing
jolly
told
him
so
the
hermit
sang
a
very
sweet
and
tender
melody
which
was
quite
different
from
jolly
cheery
carols
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
hear
such
a
beautiful
song
and
jolly
robin
was
so
delighted
that
he
began
to
laugh
heartily
the
moment
his
cousin
had
finished
the
final
note
i
would
laugh
if
i
were
you
the
hermit
reproved
him
mildly
that
a
sad
song
if
you
care
to
weep
i
be
more
than
gratified
he
said
and
he
shuddered
slightly
because
boisterous
laughter
grated
upon
his
sensitive
nerves
you
can
see
just
from
that
that
the
hermit
was
a
very
different
person
from
his
merry
cousin
jolly
robin
xiv
one
or
two
blunders
jolly
robin
cousin
the
hermit
seemed
much
disappointed
because
jolly
did
not
weep
after
hearing
the
beautiful
sad
song
but
no
matter
how
mournful
a
song
might
be
jolly
robin
could
no
more
have
shed
tears
over
it
than
a
fish
could
have
naturally
a
fish
never
weeps
because
it
would
be
a
silly
thing
to
do
surrounded
by
water
as
he
is
a
fish
could
never
see
his
own
tears
and
so
all
the
weeping
he
might
do
would
be
merely
wasted
not
wanting
to
hurt
his
cousin
feelings
jolly
robin
said
that
he
would
try
to
weep
after
he
went
home
and
that
made
the
hermit
feel
happier
once
more
perhaps
you
like
to
see
our
eggs
he
suggested
and
since
jolly
robin
said
he
would
be
delighted
to
look
at
them
if
the
hermit
wife
had
no
objection
his
cousin
led
him
further
into
the
swamp
and
there
in
a
nest
of
moss
and
leaves
lined
with
pine
needles
the
hermit
proudly
pointed
to
three
greenish
blue
eggs
somewhat
smaller
than
those
in
jolly
own
nest
in
farmer
orchard
jolly
robin
stared
at
the
nest
in
amazement
and
pretty
soon
the
hermit
grew
quite
uncomfortable
what
the
matter
he
asked
you
seem
surprised
i
certainly
am
jolly
robin
cried
how
do
you
dare
do
it
do
what
his
cousin
inquired
uneasily
why
you
and
your
wife
have
built
your
nest
on
the
ground
well
why
should
we
the
hermit
asked
and
he
looked
the
least
bit
angry
but
everybody
knows
that
the
best
place
for
a
nest
is
in
a
tree
jolly
robin
told
him
his
cousin
shook
his
head
at
that
it
a
matter
of
taste
he
said
our
family
have
always
preferred
to
build
their
nests
on
the
ground
and
as
for
me
i
shall
continue
to
follow
their
example
it
suits
me
very
well
he
added
jolly
robin
could
help
laughing
the
sight
struck
him
as
being
such
an
odd
one
it
a
wonder
he
remarked
it
a
wonder
your
wife
does
bury
her
eggs
in
the
sand
beside
the
creek
like
old
mrs
turtle
i
thank
you
said
the
hermit
stiffly
not
to
say
such
things
about
my
wife
and
though
he
spoke
politely
enough
his
manner
was
quite
cold
it
was
clear
that
he
felt
terribly
insulted
jolly
robin
saw
that
he
had
blundered
and
wishing
to
change
the
subject
he
said
hastily
wo
you
sing
another
song
so
the
hermit
cleared
his
throat
and
began
to
sing
again
although
this
song
was
not
so
sad
as
the
first
one
jolly
robin
did
not
like
it
half
so
well
the
chorus
especially
he
considered
quite
offensive
and
it
is
not
surprising
perhaps
that
it
displeased
him
for
this
is
the
way
it
went
any
old
vest
may
do
for
the
rest
but
like
a
spotted
one
best
if
it
had
been
for
that
song
jolly
robin
would
not
have
remembered
that
he
had
intended
to
speak
to
his
cousin
about
his
spotted
waistcoat
jolly
had
been
so
interested
in
the
nest
on
the
ground
that
the
matter
of
the
waistcoat
had
slipped
out
of
his
mind
but
now
he
suddenly
recalled
the
reason
why
he
had
come
to
see
the
hermit
and
he
disliked
his
cousin
spotted
finery
more
than
ever
thereupon
he
resolved
that
he
would
speak
about
it
too
xv
lost
a
cousin
when
the
hermit
thrush
had
finished
his
song
about
the
spotted
vest
he
looked
at
his
cousin
jolly
robin
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
how
do
you
like
that
one
he
inquired
he
noticed
that
jolly
was
not
laughing
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
silly
song
jolly
robin
said
but
glad
you
sang
it
because
it
has
reminded
me
that
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
about
that
spotted
waistcoat
you
so
fond
of
wearing
what
the
matter
with
my
waistcoat
the
hermit
asked
quickly
sure
it
a
very
handsome
one
i
do
like
it
jolly
told
him
i
would
be
caught
with
it
on
me
for
anything
everybody
says
that
you
a
great
dandy
because
you
wear
it
and
since
you
my
cousin
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
what
people
are
saying
about
you
i
do
care
what
people
say
the
hermit
exclaimed
those
that
do
like
my
beautiful
waistcoat
can
look
the
other
way
when
around
and
if
my
style
of
dress
does
please
you
i
suggest
that
you
keep
out
of
this
swamp
now
do
get
angry
jolly
robin
begged
he
gave
his
cousin
a
smile
hoping
that
it
might
make
him
feel
pleasanter
i
was
only
trying
to
help
you
i
was
only
going
to
advise
you
to
wear
a
red
waistcoat
like
mine
now
the
mere
thought
of
wearing
a
red
waistcoat
made
the
hermit
feel
faint
some
people
say
that
all
great
singers
are
like
that
if
they
do
like
a
thing
they
ca
bear
even
to
think
about
it
and
it
was
a
fact
that
the
words
red
waistcoat
had
always
made
jolly
cousin
shudder
maybe
one
reason
why
he
never
went
to
visit
jolly
was
because
he
could
endure
the
sight
of
his
bright
red
vest
of
course
jolly
robin
knew
nothing
about
all
this
red
would
be
very
becoming
to
you
he
continued
and
it
certainly
a
cheerful
color
too
you
need
brightening
up
i
do
believe
good
for
you
living
in
this
damp
swamp
and
singing
sad
songs
what
you
ought
to
do
is
to
get
some
clothes
like
mine
and
bring
your
wife
over
to
farmer
green
orchard
and
build
a
nest
in
an
apple
tree
we
could
have
some
gay
times
together
he
said
smilingly
like
many
other
people
jolly
robin
thought
his
own
ways
were
the
best
and
since
the
hermit
was
just
as
sure
that
nobody
else
knew
how
to
dress
or
how
to
sing
or
how
to
build
a
house
as
well
as
he
did
it
is
quite
plain
that
the
two
cousins
never
could
agree
just
tell
your
wife
about
my
plan
when
she
comes
home
said
jolly
robin
and
i
fly
over
and
show
you
the
way
to
the
orchard
i
tell
her
his
cousin
promised
good
said
jolly
robin
and
he
gave
his
delicate
cousin
a
hearty
slap
on
the
back
which
made
the
poor
fellow
wince
for
it
hurt
him
not
a
little
jolly
cried
and
chirping
loudly
he
flew
back
home
now
jolly
noticed
as
he
left
that
his
cousin
called
farewell
in
a
melancholy
tone
but
he
thought
no
more
about
it
at
the
time
he
told
his
wife
the
good
news
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
orchard
for
jolly
was
sure
that
his
cousin
the
hermit
was
going
to
follow
his
advice
but
the
next
day
jolly
met
with
a
great
surprise
when
he
went
to
the
swamp
near
black
creek
he
could
find
his
cousin
anywhere
nor
his
cousin
wife
either
even
their
three
eggs
had
disappeared
from
the
nest
on
the
ground
i
hope
fatty
coon
has
eaten
the
eggs
said
jolly
robin
as
he
gazed
into
the
empty
nest
but
it
no
more
than
anybody
could
expect
who
so
foolish
as
to
build
a
nest
on
the
ground
he
grew
quite
uneasy
and
he
was
puzzled
too
later
when
jolly
robin
met
old
crow
he
learned
that
his
cousin
the
hermit
thrush
and
his
wife
had
moved
away
from
the
swamp
the
evening
before
they
left
for
parts
unknown
old
crow
explained
i
saw
them
when
they
started
and
when
i
asked
your
cousin
where
they
were
going
he
said
that
they
did
know
but
they
were
hoping
to
find
some
peaceful
neighborhood
where
they
had
no
relations
that
strange
jolly
robin
exclaimed
we
are
very
fond
of
each
other
my
cousin
and
i
by
the
way
he
added
did
you
happen
to
notice
what
sort
of
waistcoat
he
was
wearing
crow
said
he
had
noticed
and
that
it
was
a
one
with
dark
spots
dear
me
said
jolly
robin
i
was
hoping
he
had
put
on
a
red
one
but
since
he
moved
in
such
a
hurry
perhaps
he
had
time
to
change
whether
that
was
the
case
jolly
robin
never
learned
for
he
never
saw
his
cousin
the
hermit
again
xvi
jealous
jasper
jay
the
feathered
folk
in
pleasant
valley
were
all
aflutter
they
had
heard
a
strange
tale
the
oddest
tale
almost
that
had
ever
been
told
in
their
neighborhood
it
was
jolly
robin
who
had
started
the
story
and
since
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
playing
jokes
on
people
everybody
believed
what
he
said
at
least
everybody
except
jasper
jay
he
declared
from
the
first
that
jolly
robin
tale
was
a
hoax
i
claim
that
there
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
jasper
jay
said
now
there
was
a
reason
why
jasper
spoke
in
that
disagreeable
way
he
did
want
the
story
to
be
true
and
somehow
he
felt
that
if
he
said
it
was
a
hoax
it
would
really
prove
to
be
one
i
know
well
enough
said
jasper
that
there
no
golden
bird
in
pleasant
valley
and
nowhere
else
either
you
see
jolly
robin
had
hurried
to
the
woods
one
day
and
told
everyone
he
met
that
a
wonderful
golden
bird
had
come
to
pleasant
valley
he
not
just
yellow
like
a
goldfinch
he
solid
gold
all
over
from
the
tip
of
his
bill
to
the
tip
of
his
tail
even
his
feet
are
golden
and
he
glistens
in
the
sunshine
as
if
he
were
afire
that
was
the
way
jolly
robin
described
the
marvellous
newcomer
he
the
handsomest
bird
that
ever
was
seen
he
added
perhaps
jasper
jay
was
jealous
you
know
he
was
a
great
dandy
being
very
proud
of
his
blue
suit
which
was
really
quite
beautiful
anyhow
jasper
jay
began
to
sulk
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
news
where
is
this
magnificent
person
he
asked
jolly
robin
with
a
sneer
do
let
me
see
him
and
if
he
wants
to
fight
i
soon
spoil
his
finery
for
him
he
wo
look
so
elegant
after
i
pulled
out
his
but
jolly
robin
would
tell
anybody
where
he
had
seen
the
wonderful
bird
he
said
the
golden
bird
was
three
times
as
big
as
jasper
jay
and
he
did
want
jasper
to
get
hurt
even
if
he
was
so
disagreeable
anyone
can
see
just
from
that
that
jolly
robin
was
very
kind
you
better
be
careful
or
i
fight
you
too
jasper
warned
him
but
jolly
was
not
afraid
he
knew
that
jasper
was
something
of
a
braggart
and
a
bully
he
had
chased
jasper
once
and
he
thought
he
could
do
it
again
if
he
had
to
my
cousin
will
tell
me
where
to
find
this
yellow
fellow
said
jasper
jay
at
last
there
not
much
that
happens
in
pleasant
valley
that
my
cousin
does
know
about
so
he
flew
off
to
find
old
crow
for
he
was
the
cousin
of
whom
jasper
was
speaking
jasper
found
crow
in
his
favorite
tree
in
the
pine
woods
and
sure
enough
the
old
gentleman
seemed
to
know
all
about
the
golden
bird
but
like
jolly
robin
he
refused
to
say
where
he
had
seen
him
to
tell
the
truth
crow
had
never
set
eyes
on
the
strange
bird
but
he
did
not
like
to
admit
it
he
a
great
credit
to
the
neighborhood
said
old
crow
and
you
better
let
him
alone
if
you
should
happen
to
find
him
because
he
solid
gold
you
know
and
if
you
flew
at
him
and
tried
to
peck
him
just
as
likely
as
not
you
break
your
bill
on
him
he
so
hard
old
crow
warning
however
had
no
effect
at
all
upon
jasper
jay
i
going
to
search
every
corner
in
the
valley
until
i
find
this
fop
and
i
teach
him
that
he
better
get
out
of
our
neighborhood
with
his
fine
airs
when
he
heard
that
old
crow
shook
his
head
you
going
to
have
trouble
he
told
jasper
and
then
he
hurried
away
to
tell
jolly
robin
that
he
ought
to
advise
the
golden
bird
to
leave
pleasant
valley
but
jolly
robin
said
he
had
not
spoken
with
the
stranger
and
never
having
talked
with
a
golden
bird
he
felt
a
bit
shy
about
saying
anything
to
him
then
there
be
a
terrible
fight
i
afraid
said
crow
i
afraid
so
jolly
robin
agreed
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
they
both
said
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
they
did
want
to
miss
seeing
it
xvii
only
a
rooster
jasper
jay
spent
several
days
looking
for
the
great
golden
bird
that
jolly
robin
had
described
but
jasper
could
find
the
wonderful
creature
anywhere
and
he
was
wondering
if
it
was
just
a
hoax
after
all
as
he
had
claimed
he
had
almost
decided
to
give
up
his
search
when
he
chanced
to
meet
bennie
one
day
jasper
happened
to
mention
that
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
jolly
robin
strange
bird
and
bennie
said
quickly
do
you
mean
the
bird
of
gold
the
bird
of
i
should
say
jasper
replied
with
his
nose
in
the
air
you
have
seen
him
have
you
why
yes
said
bennie
he
stays
right
near
my
house
of
course
jasper
jay
knew
that
bennie
lived
in
a
mud
house
under
the
eaves
of
farmer
green
barn
so
he
cried
at
once
then
my
search
is
ended
i
come
over
to
the
barn
this
afternoon
and
fight
the
upstart
the
news
spread
quickly
the
news
of
the
fight
that
was
going
to
take
place
at
farmer
green
barn
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
jolly
robin
went
straight
to
the
barn
and
asked
the
golden
bird
if
he
leave
pleasant
valley
at
once
but
the
great
gorgeous
creature
paid
no
attention
to
jolly
request
indeed
he
seemed
not
to
hear
his
words
at
all
though
jolly
robin
thought
the
stranger
was
just
pretending
jolly
had
to
sing
a
good
many
songs
that
day
to
keep
up
his
spirits
somehow
he
felt
that
it
was
all
his
fault
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
i
wish
i
had
told
anyone
about
the
golden
bird
he
said
maybe
he
would
have
flown
away
before
jasper
jay
heard
of
his
being
here
well
jasper
invited
everybody
to
come
to
the
barn
late
in
the
afternoon
to
see
him
whip
the
golden
bird
and
pull
out
his
there
going
to
be
some
fun
said
jasper
jay
nobody
ought
to
miss
it
so
as
the
afternoon
waned
the
feathered
folk
began
to
gather
in
the
orchard
jolly
robin
was
there
and
his
wife
and
old
crow
rusty
wren
bobbie
bobolink
miss
kitty
catbird
and
a
good
many
others
as
well
there
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
for
everyone
was
chattering
and
jasper
jay
made
almost
as
great
a
din
as
all
his
friends
together
he
boasted
in
a
loud
voice
that
he
was
going
to
give
the
golden
bird
a
terrible
beating
and
he
was
so
pleased
with
himself
that
some
of
his
companions
whispered
to
one
another
that
it
might
be
a
good
thing
if
the
golden
bird
gave
jasper
a
sound
whipping
at
last
jasper
jay
called
out
that
he
was
ready
and
then
he
started
for
farmer
green
barn
while
the
eager
crew
followed
close
behind
him
they
all
alighted
on
the
ridge
of
the
barn
and
like
jasper
jay
they
sat
there
for
a
short
time
and
stared
at
the
golden
bird
who
shimmered
like
fire
in
the
slanting
rays
of
the
setting
sun
jolly
robin
and
bennie
had
seen
him
before
so
they
were
surprised
but
all
the
others
gazed
at
him
in
amazement
now
to
jasper
jay
the
golden
bird
looked
enormous
he
was
perched
high
up
on
a
rod
which
rose
above
the
roof
and
he
seemed
very
proud
and
disdainful
in
fact
he
paid
no
attention
at
all
to
the
curious
flock
that
watched
him
for
a
little
while
nobody
said
a
word
and
jasper
jay
was
the
first
to
speak
fiddlesticks
he
cried
this
is
nothing
but
a
barnyard
fowl
he
a
rooster
that
what
he
is
xviii
on
top
of
the
barn
all
the
feathered
folk
on
the
roof
of
farmer
green
barn
saw
at
once
that
jasper
jay
had
told
the
truth
the
golden
bird
was
a
rooster
just
as
jasper
had
said
but
it
seemed
strange
to
them
that
a
rooster
should
sit
on
so
high
a
perch
it
looks
to
me
said
old
crow
it
looks
to
me
as
if
he
had
flown
up
here
and
lighted
on
that
rod
and
then
was
afraid
to
fly
down
again
i
knock
him
off
cried
jasper
jay
and
he
made
ready
to
swoop
at
the
stranger
i
would
do
that
said
jolly
robin
no
jasper
jay
replied
i
know
you
would
you
be
to
do
such
a
thing
it
not
that
jolly
robin
told
him
though
he
ten
times
my
size
this
is
what
i
mean
he
a
peaceable
fellow
and
though
i
will
admit
that
he
seems
a
little
too
proud
he
has
harmed
anybody
so
why
should
anybody
harm
him
he
a
barnyard
fowl
and
he
belongs
on
the
ground
jasper
jay
declared
if
we
let
him
stay
up
here
in
the
air
there
no
knowing
what
farmer
green
fowls
will
do
all
his
hens
and
roosters
and
he
has
a
hundred
of
may
take
to
flying
about
where
they
belong
this
golden
gentleman
is
setting
them
a
bad
example
and
it
is
my
duty
to
teach
him
a
lesson
now
the
real
reason
why
jasper
wanted
to
knock
the
golden
rooster
off
his
high
perch
was
because
he
was
so
handsome
jasper
fine
blue
suit
looked
quite
dull
beside
the
golden
dress
of
the
stranger
and
that
was
more
than
jasper
could
stand
here
i
go
jasper
cried
and
he
left
his
friends
and
flew
straight
at
the
golden
fowl
jasper
struck
the
rooster
such
a
hard
blow
that
he
spun
around
on
his
perch
twice
but
he
did
lose
his
balance
and
he
never
said
a
single
word
i
pull
out
his
this
time
jasper
squawked
as
he
darted
at
the
stranger
again
but
jasper
had
no
luck
at
all
though
he
pecked
viciously
at
the
tail
of
the
golden
rooster
he
succeeded
only
in
hurting
his
own
bill
several
times
jasper
tried
but
not
one
came
away
and
some
of
the
onlookers
began
to
smile
old
crow
even
guffawed
aloud
but
jasper
jay
pretended
not
to
hear
him
do
you
think
we
better
go
away
jolly
robin
asked
jasper
at
last
i
think
had
better
leave
jasper
screamed
he
was
very
angry
because
he
knew
that
his
friends
were
laughing
at
him
and
instead
of
flying
at
the
golden
rooster
again
he
made
a
swift
attack
on
jolly
robin
being
angry
jasper
had
forgotten
that
jolly
robin
wife
was
present
and
to
the
rascal
there
seemed
suddenly
to
be
as
many
as
six
jolly
robins
each
one
with
a
furious
wife
too
jasper
fought
his
hardest
but
he
was
no
match
for
them
very
soon
he
made
for
the
woods
and
as
he
flew
away
a
blue
with
a
white
tip
floated
down
into
the
barnyard
where
johnnie
green
had
stood
for
some
minutes
watching
the
strange
sight
on
the
roof
of
his
father
barn
johnnie
picked
up
the
feather
and
stuck
it
in
his
hat
and
when
he
told
his
father
later
how
a
big
blue
jay
had
tried
to
whip
the
new
and
a
pair
of
robins
as
well
farmer
green
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
loudly
do
you
believe
me
johnnie
asked
him
here
the
blue
anyhow
and
that
ought
to
prove
that
i
am
telling
the
truth
but
farmer
green
only
laughed
all
the
more
you
see
he
could
hardly
believe
all
the
strange
things
that
happened
in
the
neighborhood
xix
curious
crow
living
in
the
orchard
as
they
did
near
the
farmhouse
jolly
robin
and
his
wife
knew
more
about
farmer
green
family
than
any
of
the
other
birds
in
pleasant
valley
except
maybe
rusty
wren
being
a
house
wren
rusty
was
naturally
on
the
best
of
terms
with
all
the
people
in
the
farmhouse
but
all
summer
long
rusty
wren
never
strayed
far
from
home
so
it
was
jolly
robin
who
told
his
friends
in
the
woods
many
strange
stories
about
what
happened
near
the
orchard
his
account
of
the
golden
bird
was
only
one
of
many
curious
tales
that
he
related
to
the
wondering
being
so
cheerful
and
having
so
much
interesting
news
to
tell
jolly
robin
was
welcome
wherever
he
went
and
when
his
friends
met
him
in
the
woods
or
the
fields
they
were
sure
to
stop
and
ask
him
if
he
had
some
new
story
to
tell
one
day
old
crow
even
took
the
trouble
to
fly
all
the
way
across
the
cornfield
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
where
his
sharp
eyes
had
seen
jolly
robin
eating
wild
cherries
i
say
what
do
you
know
that
new
crow
asked
him
the
old
gentleman
was
a
very
curious
person
being
a
great
gossip
he
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
something
to
talk
about
i
do
believe
i
seen
anything
lately
that
would
interest
you
jolly
replied
unless
it
the
man
crow
looked
up
quickly
what
that
you
say
he
exclaimed
the
man
jolly
robin
repeated
is
that
a
joke
crow
asked
he
was
inclined
to
be
suspicious
because
he
always
disliked
having
tricks
played
upon
him
i
heard
of
and
seen
a
calf
he
remarked
but
a
man
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
to
believe
in
unless
i
behold
him
with
my
own
eyes
jolly
robin
laughed
it
no
joke
at
all
he
declared
then
what
are
you
laughing
at
crow
inquired
severely
nothing
jolly
robin
answered
it
just
a
habit
of
mine
to
laugh
very
well
said
crow
i
accept
your
apology
but
please
do
it
again
and
now
he
added
where
pray
is
this
wonderful
man
in
the
barnyard
jolly
robin
informed
him
i
often
seen
him
lately
walking
between
the
house
and
the
barn
he
looks
a
good
deal
like
the
but
of
course
it
ca
be
he
for
the
as
you
yourself
know
has
but
two
arms
i
must
have
a
look
at
this
monster
crow
remarked
when
would
be
a
good
time
for
me
to
see
him
at
jolly
robin
told
him
if
you
meet
me
on
the
bridge
down
the
road
when
you
see
johnnie
green
and
old
dog
spot
driving
the
cows
home
from
the
pasture
this
afternoon
i
be
glad
to
show
you
the
man
and
then
you
admit
that
i
not
joking
i
certainly
be
there
crow
promised
but
on
one
condition
you
must
tell
me
now
whether
you
have
ever
known
this
queer
being
to
fire
a
gun
if
a
man
can
shoot
one
gun
i
see
no
reason
why
a
man
could
not
fire
at
least
two
guns
at
the
same
time
and
if
there
any
chance
of
such
a
thing
happening
i
would
not
care
to
be
present
jolly
robin
had
hard
work
to
keep
from
laughing
again
the
very
idea
of
the
man
aiming
two
guns
at
old
crow
struck
him
as
being
very
funny
he
could
speak
at
all
for
a
few
moments
but
he
shook
his
head
violently
you
think
there
no
danger
then
said
crow
anxiously
none
at
all
jolly
robin
answered
him
he
carries
nothing
more
dangerous
than
then
i
meet
you
on
the
bridge
crow
promised
xx
the
man
old
dog
spot
was
driving
the
last
cow
down
the
lane
when
jolly
robin
and
crow
met
on
the
bridge
near
the
farmhouse
as
they
had
agreed
now
then
said
crow
even
before
his
broad
wings
had
settled
smoothly
along
his
back
now
then
where
the
man
jolly
looked
towards
the
barnyard
i
do
see
him
yet
he
said
but
he
ought
to
appear
any
moment
now
let
move
over
to
the
big
oak
for
we
can
get
a
better
view
of
the
barnyard
from
the
top
of
it
crow
was
more
than
willing
so
they
flew
to
the
oak
and
waited
for
a
time
they
saw
the
cows
file
into
the
barn
each
finding
her
own
place
in
one
of
the
two
long
rows
of
stanchions
that
faced
each
other
across
the
wide
aisle
running
the
length
of
the
barn
it
was
through
that
aisle
that
the
men
walked
with
great
forkfuls
of
hay
in
the
winter
time
which
they
flung
down
before
the
cows
who
munched
it
contentedly
but
it
was
summer
now
and
the
cows
found
their
own
food
in
the
pasture
on
the
hillside
they
came
to
the
barn
only
to
be
milked
it
right
now
jolly
robin
remarked
and
pretty
soon
you
see
the
man
come
out
of
the
barn
with
some
pails
full
of
milk
he
carry
them
into
the
house
to
set
them
in
the
buttery
we
have
a
good
look
at
him
without
his
knowing
anything
about
it
and
that
was
exactly
what
happened
here
he
comes
jolly
robin
exclaimed
as
a
figure
stepped
out
of
the
barn
and
began
walking
toward
the
house
now
you
have
to
admit
that
i
was
joking
when
i
told
you
the
news
of
this
strange
being
you
ought
to
be
pretty
glad
i
let
you
know
about
the
man
crow
i
guess
you
never
saw
anything
quite
so
queer
as
he
is
even
if
you
seen
a
calf
jolly
robin
said
a
great
deal
more
to
crow
and
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
started
to
sing
a
song
but
crow
quickly
silenced
him
do
keep
still
he
whispered
do
you
want
to
get
me
into
trouble
it
bad
enough
to
have
a
trick
like
this
played
on
me
without
your
making
such
a
noise
farmer
green
might
shoot
me
if
he
saw
me
so
near
his
house
i
thought
crow
added
i
thought
you
laughed
a
little
too
much
when
you
told
me
about
your
man
it
a
hoax
a
joke
a
trick
and
a
very
poor
one
too
jolly
robin
was
puzzled
enough
by
crow
disagreeable
remarks
i
do
understand
how
you
can
say
those
things
he
said
crow
looked
narrowly
at
his
small
companion
before
answering
and
then
he
asked
do
you
mean
to
say
you
never
heard
of
a
never
cried
jolly
robin
well
well
said
crow
the
ignorance
of
some
people
is
more
than
i
can
understand
that
was
no
man
you
said
he
looked
like
farmer
green
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
does
for
he
is
the
he
has
found
an
old
somewhere
it
is
just
a
piece
of
wood
that
fits
about
his
shoulders
and
around
his
neck
and
sticks
out
on
each
side
of
him
like
an
arm
and
he
hooks
a
pail
of
milk
to
each
end
of
the
yoke
carrying
his
load
in
that
way
i
supposed
said
crow
that
people
had
stopped
using
fifty
years
ago
it
certainly
that
long
since
seen
one
then
it
no
wonder
that
i
made
a
mistake
jolly
robin
cried
for
i
too
young
ever
to
have
heard
of
a
even
and
he
laughed
and
chuckled
merrily
it
a
good
joke
on
me
he
said
but
old
crow
did
not
laugh
there
you
go
making
a
noise
again
he
said
crossly
a
person
not
safe
in
your
company
and
he
hurried
off
across
the
meadow
crow
was
always
very
nervous
when
he
was
near
the
farmhouse
but
jolly
robin
stayed
right
there
until
the
walked
back
to
the
barn
he
saw
then
that
what
crow
had
told
him
was
really
so
and
he
never
stopped
laughing
until
long
after
sunset
xxi
a
doleful
ditty
jolly
robin
often
complained
about
the
wailing
of
willie
willie
lived
in
the
woods
which
were
not
far
from
the
orchard
and
it
was
annoying
to
jolly
to
hear
his
call
repeated
over
and
over
again
for
some
two
hours
after
jolly
neither
did
jolly
robin
enjoy
being
awakened
by
that
same
sound
an
hour
or
two
before
he
wanted
to
get
up
in
the
morning
and
what
was
still
worse
on
moonlight
nights
willie
sometimes
sang
his
favorite
song
from
sunset
to
sunrise
what
a
doleful
ditty
said
jolly
robin
i
must
see
this
fellow
and
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
change
his
tune
but
the
trouble
was
that
jolly
robin
did
not
like
to
roam
about
at
night
he
was
always
too
sleepy
to
do
that
and
in
the
daytime
willie
was
silent
resting
or
sleeping
upon
the
ground
in
the
woods
but
a
day
came
at
last
when
jolly
robin
stumbled
upon
willie
sound
asleep
where
he
lived
and
jolly
lost
no
time
in
waking
him
up
i
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
for
some
time
he
told
the
drowsy
fellow
what
the
matter
willie
asked
with
a
startled
stare
are
the
woods
on
fire
no
said
jolly
robin
i
want
to
talk
with
you
that
all
and
he
was
as
cheerful
as
anyone
could
have
wished
but
willie
looked
very
cross
this
is
a
queer
time
to
make
a
call
he
grumbled
i
do
like
to
be
disturbed
in
broad
daylight
i
supposed
everybody
knew
that
midnight
is
the
proper
time
for
a
visit
but
i
always
asleep
then
jolly
robin
objected
unless
it
a
moonlight
night
and
you
happen
to
be
singing
on
my
side
of
the
woods
willie
looked
almost
pleasant
when
jolly
said
that
so
you
stay
awake
to
hear
me
he
exclaimed
i
see
you
like
my
singing
jolly
robin
laughed
because
willie
had
made
such
a
funny
mistake
you
wrong
he
said
in
fact
i
been
wanting
to
talk
with
you
about
that
very
thing
i
want
you
to
change
your
song
which
is
a
very
annoying
one
it
altogether
too
disagreeable
i
teach
you
my
song
you
like
it
much
better
i
think
and
i
sure
all
your
neighbors
will
why
not
learn
the
new
song
right
now
jolly
asked
but
willie
made
no
answer
looking
at
him
more
closely
jolly
robin
was
amazed
to
see
that
he
was
sound
asleep
here
wake
up
jolly
cried
as
he
nudged
willie
under
a
wing
again
willie
sprang
up
with
a
bewildered
expression
hullo
he
said
what
the
trouble
did
a
tree
fall
you
went
to
sleep
while
i
was
talking
to
you
jolly
robin
explained
oh
said
willie
that
does
matter
you
must
be
used
to
that
and
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
before
he
had
fallen
asleep
again
jolly
robin
looked
at
him
in
a
puzzled
way
he
did
see
how
he
could
teach
willie
his
song
unless
he
could
keep
him
awake
but
he
thought
he
ought
to
try
so
he
gave
willie
a
sharp
tweak
with
his
bill
did
you
hear
what
i
said
about
your
singing
he
shouted
right
in
willie
ear
willie
only
murmured
sleepily
it
rheumatism
i
just
felt
a
twinge
of
it
he
had
no
idea
what
jolly
robin
was
talking
about
xxii
shocking
manners
jolly
robin
tried
his
best
to
rouse
willie
out
of
his
daytime
nap
but
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
at
last
that
his
efforts
were
in
vain
it
was
plain
that
willie
was
too
sleepy
to
understand
what
was
said
to
him
and
as
for
his
learning
a
new
song
when
he
was
in
that
condition
that
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
i
have
to
wait
till
sunset
jolly
robin
sighed
at
last
the
time
that
willie
always
wakes
up
and
begins
to
sing
i
come
back
here
late
this
afternoon
so
he
left
the
woods
and
he
was
busy
every
moment
all
the
rest
of
the
day
shortly
before
sunset
jolly
robin
went
back
to
the
place
in
the
woods
where
he
had
left
willie
sleeping
but
willie
was
no
longer
there
he
had
left
only
a
few
minutes
before
jolly
arrival
and
as
jolly
sat
on
a
low
branch
of
a
tree
and
looked
all
around
just
as
the
sun
dropped
behind
the
mountain
a
voice
began
singing
from
some
point
deeper
in
the
woods
that
was
the
way
the
song
went
there
willie
now
jolly
robin
exclaimed
and
he
flew
off
at
once
to
find
his
friend
he
knew
that
willie
was
some
distance
away
because
he
could
hear
the
low
with
which
willie
always
began
his
song
as
a
sort
of
warning
that
he
was
going
to
sing
and
that
nobody
could
stop
him
jolly
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
finding
the
singer
because
willie
did
stay
in
one
place
between
his
bursts
of
song
he
coursed
about
hunting
for
insects
which
he
caught
as
he
flew
so
it
was
not
surprising
that
jolly
did
not
come
upon
him
until
it
had
grown
almost
dark
in
the
woods
hullo
said
willie
as
soon
as
he
saw
jolly
robin
i
have
seen
you
for
a
long
time
jolly
robin
laughed
merrily
do
you
remember
my
calling
on
you
about
noon
he
asked
you
must
be
mistaken
willie
replied
i
been
asleep
since
sunrise
until
a
little
while
ago
and
nobody
came
to
see
me
you
forgotten
said
jolly
but
it
no
matter
i
can
talk
to
you
now
just
as
well
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
your
singing
jolly
paused
then
and
he
yawned
widely
for
it
was
his
that
very
moment
talk
fast
please
said
willie
i
have
finished
my
breakfast
yet
and
i
pretty
hungry
it
seemed
queer
to
jolly
robin
that
anyone
should
be
eating
his
breakfast
right
after
sunset
and
he
was
about
to
say
something
about
the
matter
but
just
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
he
yawned
again
and
then
without
realizing
what
he
was
doing
he
tucked
his
head
under
his
wing
and
fell
asleep
on
the
limb
of
the
cedar
tree
where
he
was
sitting
willie
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
what
shocking
manners
he
exclaimed
he
went
to
sleep
while
we
were
talking
but
i
suppose
he
knows
no
better
willie
would
have
liked
to
know
what
jolly
robin
was
going
to
say
about
his
singing
but
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
left
jolly
asleep
upon
his
perch
and
hurried
off
to
look
for
more
insects
since
it
was
a
moonlight
night
willie
spent
all
the
time
until
sunrise
in
hunting
for
food
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
rest
and
sing
his
queer
song
which
jolly
robin
did
not
like
but
jolly
robin
slept
so
soundly
that
for
once
willie
singing
never
disturbed
him
at
all
xxiii
a
cold
greeting
when
jolly
robin
awoke
a
little
before
dawn
after
his
night
in
the
woods
he
did
not
know
at
first
where
he
was
now
it
happened
that
just
as
he
was
awaking
in
the
cedar
tree
willie
was
going
to
sleep
on
the
ground
right
beneath
him
so
when
jolly
at
last
looked
down
and
spied
his
friend
he
remembered
what
had
happened
my
goodness
he
said
with
a
nervous
laugh
i
fell
asleep
here
last
night
and
i
wonder
what
my
wife
will
say
when
i
get
home
he
would
have
liked
to
try
to
rouse
willie
and
speak
to
him
about
learning
the
new
song
but
he
was
so
uneasy
on
account
of
what
his
wife
might
say
about
his
having
stayed
away
from
home
all
night
that
he
flew
away
as
fast
as
he
could
go
it
was
exactly
as
he
had
feared
when
he
reached
his
house
in
the
orchard
his
wife
greeted
him
quite
coldly
in
fact
she
hardly
spoke
to
him
at
all
and
when
jolly
told
her
with
a
good
many
chuckles
what
a
joke
he
had
played
on
himself
falling
asleep
as
he
had
while
making
a
call
upon
willie
she
did
not
even
smile
i
should
think
you
would
be
ashamed
of
yourself
she
told
him
willie
is
a
rascal
everybody
talks
about
the
way
he
prowls
through
the
woods
all
night
and
seldom
goes
to
bed
before
morning
and
his
wife
is
no
better
than
he
is
they
too
shiftless
even
to
build
themselves
a
nest
leaves
her
eggs
on
the
ground
and
that
enough
to
know
about
if
you
like
to
spend
your
time
with
such
trash
you
better
go
over
to
the
woods
and
live
robin
said
and
then
she
turned
her
back
on
her
husband
and
set
to
work
to
clean
her
nest
jolly
and
his
wife
happened
to
have
five
small
children
at
the
time
they
were
so
young
that
they
had
never
left
home
not
having
learned
to
fly
and
they
were
all
clamoring
for
their
breakfast
thinking
to
please
his
wife
jolly
robin
went
off
and
began
gathering
angleworms
for
the
youngsters
but
when
he
brought
them
home
his
wife
told
him
that
he
had
better
eat
them
himself
i
am
quite
able
to
feed
my
own
children
without
any
help
from
a
person
who
does
come
home
until
after
daybreak
she
said
and
she
acted
like
that
for
two
whole
days
naturally
jolly
robin
felt
very
uncomfortable
during
that
time
and
ever
afterward
he
took
good
care
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
willie
he
did
wish
however
that
willie
would
learn
a
new
song
for
jolly
disliked
more
than
ever
to
hear
that
repeated
over
and
over
again
it
always
reminded
him
of
the
time
he
made
his
wife
angry
by
spending
the
night
away
from
home
the
end
