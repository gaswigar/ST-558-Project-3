smalcald
articles
articles
of
christian
doctrine
which
were
to
have
been
presented
on
our
part
to
the
council
if
any
had
been
assembled
at
mantua
or
elsewhere
indicating
what
we
could
accept
or
yield
and

we
could

preface
of
martin
luther
since
pope
paul
iii
convoked
a
council
last
year
to
assemble
at
mantua
about
whitsuntide
and
afterwards
transferred
it
from
mantua
so
that
it
is
not
yet
known
where
he
will
or
can
fix
it
and
we
on
our
part
either
had
to
expect
that
we
would
be
summoned
also
to
the
council
or
to
fear
that
we
would
be
condemned
unsummoned
i
was
directed
to
compile
and
collect
the
articles
of
our
doctrine
in
order
that
it
might
be
plain
in
case
of
deliberation
as
to
what
and
how
far
we
would
be
both
willing
and
able
to
yield
to
the
papists
and
in
what
points
we
intended
to
persevere
and
abide
to
the
end
i
have
accordingly
compiled
these
articles
and
presented
them
to
our
side
they
have
also
been
accepted
and
unanimously
confessed
by
our
side
and
it
has
been
resolved
that
in
case
the
pope
with
his
adherents
should
ever
be
so
bold
as
seriously
and
in
good
faith
without
lying
and
cheating
to
hold
a
truly
free
legitimate
christian
council
as
indeed
he
would
be
in
duty
bound
to
do
they
be
publicly
delivered
in
order
to
set
forth
the
confession
of
our
faith
but
though
the
romish
court
is
so
dreadfully
afraid
of
a
free
christian
council
and
shuns
the
light
so
shamefully
that
it
has
entirely
removed
even
from
those
who
are
on
its
side
the
hope
that
it
will
ever
permit
a
free
council
much
less
that
it
will
itself
hold
one
whereat
as
is
just
they
many
papists
are
greatly
offended
and
have
no
little
trouble
on
that
account
are
disgusted
with
this
negligence
of
the
pope
since
they
notice
thereby
that
the
pope
would
rather
see
all
christendom
perish
and
all
souls
damned
than
suffer
either
himself
or
his
adherents
to
be
reformed
even
a
little
and
his
their
tyranny
to
be
limited
nevertheless
i
have
determined
meanwhile
to
publish
these
articles
in
plain
print
so
that
should
i
die
before
there
would
be
a
council
as
i
fully
expect
and
hope
because
the
knaves
who
flee
the
light
and
shun
the
day
take
such
wretched
pains
to
delay
and
hinder
the
council
those
who
live
and
remain
after
me
may
have
my
testimony
and
confession
to
produce
in
addition
to
the
confession
which
i
have
issued
previously
whereby
up
to
this
time
i
have
abided
and
by
god
grace
will
abide
for
what
shall
i
say
how
shall
i
complain
i
am
still
living
writing
preaching
and
lecturing
daily
and
yet
there
are
found
such
spiteful
men
not
only
among
the
adversaries
but
also
false
brethren
that
profess
to
be
on
our
side
as
dare
to
cite
my
writings
and
doctrine
directly
against
myself
and
let
me
look
on
and
listen
although
they
know
well
that
i
teach
otherwise
and
as
wish
to
adorn
their
venom
with
my
labor
and
under
my
name
to
deceive
and
mislead
the
poor
people
good
god
alas
what
first
will
happen
when
i
am
dead
indeed
i
ought
to
reply
to
everything
while
i
am
still
living
but
again
how
can
i
alone
stop
all
the
mouths
of
the
devil
especially
of
those
as
they
all
are
poisoned
who
will
not
hear
or
notice
what
we
write
but
solely
exercise
themselves
with
all
diligence
how
they
may
most
shamefully
pervert
and
corrupt
our
word
in
every
letter
these
i
let
the
devil
answer
or
at
last
gods
wrath
as
they
deserve
i
often
think
of
the
good
gerson
who
doubts
whether
anything
good
should
be
written
and
published
if
it
is
not
done
many
souls
are
neglected
who
could
be
delivered
but
if
it
is
done
the
devil
is
there
with
malignant
villainous
tongues
without
number
which
envenom
and
pervert
everything
so
that
nevertheless
the
fruit
the
usefulness
of
the
writings
is
prevented
yet
what
they
gain
thereby
is
manifest
for
while
they
have
lied
so
shamefully
against
us
and
by
means
of
lies
wished
to
retain
the
people
god
has
constantly
advanced
his
work
and
been
making
their
following
ever
smaller
and
ours
greater
and
by
their
lies
has
caused
and
still
causes
them
to
be
brought
to
shame
i
must
tell
a
story
there
was
a
doctor
sent
here
to
wittenberg
from
france
who
said
publicly
before
us
that
his
king
was
sure
and
more
than
sure
that
among
us
there
is
no
church
no
magistrate
no
married
life
but
all
live
promiscuously
as
cattle
and
each
one
does
as
he
pleases
imagine
now
how
will
those
who
by
their
writings
have
instilled
such
gross
lies
into
the
king
and
other
countries
as
the
pure
truth
look
at
us
on
that
day
before
the
of
christ
christ
the
lord
and
judge
of
us
all
knows
well
that
they
lie
and
have
always
lied
his
sentence
they
in
turn
must
hear
that
i
know
certainly
god
convert
to
repentance
those
who
can
be
converted
regarding
the
rest
it
will
be
said
woe
and
alas
eternally
but
to
return
to
the
subject
i
verily
desire
to
see
a
truly
christian
council
assembled
some
time
in
order
that
many
matters
and
persons
might
be
helped
not
that
we
need
it
for
our
churches
are
now
through
god
grace
so
enlightened
and
equipped
with
the
pure
word
and
right
use
of
the
sacraments
with
knowledge
of
the
various
callings
and
of
right
works
that
we
on
our
part
ask
for
no
council
and
on
such
points
have
nothing
better
to
hope
or
expect
from
a
council
but
we
see
in
the
bishoprics
everywhere
so
many
parishes
vacant
and
desolate
that
one
heart
would
break
and
yet
neither
the
bishops
nor
canons
care
how
the
poor
people
live
or
die
for
whom
nevertheless
christ
has
died
and
who
are
not
permitted
to
hear
him
speak
with
them
as
the
true
shepherd
with
his
sheep
this
causes
me
to
shudder
and
fear
that
at
some
time
he
may
send
a
council
of
angels
upon
germany
utterly
destroying
us
like
sodom
and
gomorrah
because
we
so
wantonly
mock
him
with
the
council
besides
such
necessary
ecclesiastical
affairs
there
would
be
also
in
the
political
estate
innumerable
matters
of
great
importance
to
improve
there
is
the
disagreement
between
the
princes
and
the
states
usury
and
avarice
have
burst
in
like
a
flood
and
have
become
lawful
are
defended
with
a
show
of
right
wantonness
lewdness
extravagance
in
dress
gluttony
gambling
idle
display
with
all
kinds
of
bad
habits
and
wickedness
insubordination
of
subjects
of
domestics
and
laborers
of
every
trade
also
the
exactions
and
most
exorbitant
selling
prices
of
the
peasants
and
who
can
enumerate
all
have
so
increased
that
they
can
not
be
rectified
by
ten
councils
and
twenty
diets
if
such
chief
matters
of
the
spiritual
and
worldly
estates
as
are
contrary
to
god
would
be
considered
in
the
council
they
would
have
all
hands
so
full
that
the
child
play
and
absurdity
of
long
gowns
official
insignia
large
tonsures
broad
cinctures
or
sashes
bishops
or
cardinals
hats
or
maces
and
like
jugglery
would
in
the
mean
time
be
forgotten
if
we
first
had
performed
god
command
and
order
in
the
spiritual
and
secular
estate
we
would
find
time
enough
to
reform
food
clothing
tonsures
and
surplices
but
if
we
want
to
swallow
such
camels
and
instead
strain
at
gnats
let
the
beams
stand
and
judge
the
motes
we
also
might
indeed
be
satisfied
with
the
council
therefore
i
have
presented
few
articles
for
we
have
without
this
so
many
commands
of
god
to
observe
in
the
church
the
state
and
the
family
that
we
can
never
fulfil
them
what
then
is
the
use
or
what
does
it
profit
that
many
decrees
and
statutes
thereon
are
made
in
the
council
especially
when
these
chief
matters
commanded
of
god
are
neither
regarded
nor
observed
just
as
though
he
were
bound
to
honor
our
jugglery
as
a
reward
of
our
treading
his
solemn
commandments
under
foot
but
our
sins
weigh
upon
us
and
cause
god
not
to
be
gracious
to
us
for
we
do
not
repent
and
besides
wish
to
defend
every
abomination
o
lord
jesus
christ
do
thou
thyself
convoke
a
council
and
deliver
thy
servants
by
thy
glorious
advent
the
pope
and
his
adherents
are
done
for
they
will
have
none
of
thee
do
thou
then
help
us
who
are
poor
and
needy
who
sigh
to
thee
and
beseech
thee
earnestly
according
to
the
grace
which
thou
hast
given
us
through
thy
holy
ghost
who
liveth
and
reigneth
with
thee
and
the
father
blessed
forever
amen
the
first
part
treats
of
the
sublime
articles
concerning
the
divine
majesty
as
i
that
father
son
and
holy
ghost
three
distinct
persons
in
one
divine
essence
and
nature
are
one
god
who
has
created
heaven
and
earth
ii
that
the
father
is
begotten
of
no
one
the
son
of
the
father
the
holy
ghost
proceeds
from
father
and
son
iii
that
not
the
father
nor
the
holy
ghost
but
the
son
became
man
iv
that
the
son
became
man
in
this
manner
that
he
was
conceived
without
the
cooperation
of
man
by
the
holy
ghost
and
was
born
of
the
pure
holy
and
always
virgin
mary
afterwards
he
suffered
died
was
buried
descended
to
hell
rose
from
the
dead
ascended
to
heaven
sits
at
the
right
hand
of
god
will
come
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
etc
as
the
creed
of
the
apostles
as
well
as
that
of
athanasius
and
the
catechism
in
common
use
for
children
teach
concerning
these
articles
there
is
no
contention
or
dispute
since
we
on
both
sides
confess
them
therefore
it
is
not
necessary
now
to
treat
further
of
them
the
second
part
treats
of
the
articles
which
refer
to
the
office
and
work
of
jesus
christ
or
our
redemption
the
first
and
chief
article
is
this
that
jesus
christ
our
god
and
lord
died
for
our
sins
and
was
raised
again
for
our
justification
rom
and
he
alone
is
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
john
and
god
has
laid
upon
him
the
iniquities
of
us
all
is
likewise
all
have
sinned
and
are
justified
without
merit
freely
and
without
their
own
works
or
merits
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
christ
jesus
in
his
blood
rom
now
since
it
is
necessary
to
believe
this
and
it
can
not
be
otherwise
acquired
or
apprehended
by
any
work
law
or
merit
it
is
clear
and
certain
that
this
faith
alone
justifies
us
as
paul
says
rom
for
we
conclude
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
without
the
deeds
of
the
law
likewise
that
he
might
be
just
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
christ
of
this
article
nothing
can
be
yielded
or
surrendered
nor
can
anything
be
granted
or
permitted
contrary
to
the
same
even
though
heaven
and
earth
and
whatever
will
not
abide
should
sink
to
ruin
for
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
saved
says
peter
acts
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
is
and
upon
this
article
all
things
depend
which
we
teach
and
practice
in
opposition
to
the
pope
the
devil
and
the
whole
world
therefore
we
must
be
sure
concerning
this
doctrine
and
not
doubt
for
otherwise
all
is
lost
and
the
pope
and
devil
and
all
things
gain
the
victory
and
suit
over
us
article
ii
of
the
mass
that
the
mass
in
the
papacy
must
be
the
greatest
and
most
horrible
abomination
as
it
directly
and
powerfully
conflicts
with
this
chief
article
and
yet
above
and
before
all
other
popish
idolatries
it
has
been
the
chief
and
most
specious
for
it
has
been
held
that
this
sacrifice
or
work
of
the
mass
even
though
it
be
rendered
by
a
wicked
and
abandoned
scoundrel
frees
men
from
sins
both
in
this
life
and
also
in
purgatory
while
only
the
lamb
of
god
shall
and
must
do
this
as
has
been
said
above
of
this
article
nothing
is
to
be
surrendered
or
conceded
because
the
first
article
does
not
allow
it
if
perchance
there
were
reasonable
papists
we
might
speak
moderately
and
in
a
friendly
way
thus
first
why
they
so
rigidly
uphold
the
mass
for
it
is
but
a
pure
invention
of
men
and
has
not
been
commanded
by
god
and
every
invention
of
man
we
may
safely
discard
as
christ
declares
matt
in
vain
do
they
worship
me
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
men
secondly
it
is
an
unnecessary
thing
which
can
be
omitted
without
sin
and
danger
thirdly
the
sacrament
can
be
received
in
a
better
and
more
blessed
way
more
acceptable
to
god
yea
the
only
blessed
way
according
to
the
institution
of
christ
why
then
do
they
drive
the
world
to
woe
and
extreme
misery
on
account
of
a
fictitious
unnecessary
matter
which
can
be
well
obtained
in
another
and
more
blessed
way
let
care
be
taken
that
it
be
publicly
preached
to
the
people
that
the
mass
as
men
twaddle
commentitious
affair
or
human
figment
can
be
omitted
without
sin
and
that
no
one
will
be
condemned
who
does
not
observe
it
but
that
he
can
be
saved
in
a
better
way
without
the
mass
i
wager
thus
it
will
come
to
pass
that
the
mass
will
then
collapse
of
itself
not
only
among
the
insane
rude
common
people
but
also
among
all
pious
christian
reasonable
hearts
and
that
the
more
when
they
would
hear
that
the
mass
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
fabricated
and
invented
without
the
will
and
word
of
god
fourthly
since
such
innumerable
and
unspeakable
abuses
have
arisen
in
the
whole
world
from
the
buying
and
selling
of
masses
the
mass
should
by
right
be
relinquished
if
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
prevent
abuses
even
though
in
itself
it
had
something
advantageous
and
good
how
much
more
ought
we
to
relinquish
it
so
as
to
prevent
escape
forever
these
horrible
abuses
since
it
is
altogether
unnecessary
useless
and
dangerous
and
we
can
obtain
everything
by
a
more
necessary
profitable
and
certain
way
without
the
mass
fifthly
but
since
the
mass
is
nothing
else
and
can
be
nothing
else
as
the
canon
and
all
books
declare
than
a
work
of
men
even
of
wicked
scoundrels
by
which
one
attempts
to
reconcile
himself
and
others
to
god
and
to
obtain
and
merit
the
remission
of
sins
and
grace
for
thus
the
mass
is
observed
when
it
is
observed
at
the
very
best
otherwise
what
purpose
would
it
serve
for
this
very
reason
it
must
and
should
certainly
be
condemned
and
rejected
for
this
directly
conflicts
with
the
chief
article
which
says
that
it
is
not
a
wicked
or
a
godly
hireling
of
the
mass
with
his
own
work
but
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
son
of
god
that
taketh
away
our
sins
but
if
any
one
should
advance
the
pretext
that
as
an
act
of
devotion
he
wishes
to
administer
the
sacrament
or
communion
to
himself
he
is
not
in
earnest
he
would
commit
a
great
mistake
and
would
not
be
speaking
seriously
and
sincerely
for
if
he
wishes
to
commune
in
sincerity
the
surest
and
best
way
for
him
is
in
the
sacrament
administered
according
to
christ
institution
but
that
one
administer
communion
to
himself
is
a
human
notion
uncertain
unnecessary
yea
even
prohibited
and
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
doing
because
without
the
word
of
god
he
obeys
a
false
human
opinion
and
invention
so
too
it
is
not
right
even
though
the
matter
were
otherwise
correct
for
one
to
use
the
common
sacrament
of
belonging
to
the
church
according
to
his
own
private
devotion
and
without
god
word
and
apart
from
the
communion
of
the
church
to
trifle
therewith
this
article
concerning
the
mass
will
be
the
whole
business
of
the
council
the
council
will
perspire
most
over
and
be
occupied
with
this
article
concerning
the
mass
for
if
it
were
although
it
would
be
possible
for
them
to
concede
to
us
all
the
other
articles
yet
they
could
not
concede
this
as
campegius
said
at
augsburg
that
he
would
be
torn
to
pieces
before
he
would
relinquish
the
mass
so
by
the
help
of
god
i
too
would
suffer
myself
to
be
reduced
to
ashes
before
i
would
allow
a
hireling
of
the
mass
be
he
good
or
bad
to
be
made
equal
to
christ
jesus
my
lord
and
savior
or
to
be
exalted
above
him
thus
we
are
and
remain
eternally
separated
and
opposed
to
one
another
they
feel
well
enough
that
when
the
mass
falls
the
papacy
lies
in
ruins
before
they
will
permit
this
to
occur
they
will
put
us
all
to
death
if
they
can
in
addition
to
all
this
this
dragon
tail
i
mean
the
mass
has
begotten
a
numerous
of
manifold
idolatries
first
purgatory
here
they
carried
their
trade
into
purgatory
by
masses
for
souls
and
vigils
and
weekly
monthly
and
yearly
celebrations
of
obsequies
and
finally
by
the
common
week
and
all
souls
day
by
so
that
the
mass
is
used
almost
alone
for
the
dead
although
christ
has
instituted
the
sacrament
alone
for
the
living
therefore
purgatory
and
every
solemnity
rite
and
commerce
connected
with
it
is
to
be
regarded
as
nothing
but
a
specter
of
the
devil
for
it
conflicts
with
the
chief
article
which
teaches
that
only
christ
and
not
the
works
of
men
are
to
help
set
free
souls
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
nothing
has
been
divinely
commanded
or
enjoined
upon
us
concerning
the
dead
therefore
all
this
may
be
safely
omitted
even
if
it
were
no
error
and
idolatry
the
papists
quote
here
augustine
and
some
of
the
fathers
who
are
said
to
have
written
concerning
purgatory
and
they
think
that
we
do
not
understand
for
what
purpose
and
to
what
end
they
spoke
as
they
did
augustine
does
not
write
that
there
is
a
purgatory
nor
has
he
a
testimony
of
scripture
to
constrain
him
thereto
but
he
leaves
it
in
doubt
whether
there
is
one
and
says
that
his
mother
asked
to
be
remembered
at
the
altar
or
sacrament
now
all
this
is
indeed
nothing
but
the
devotion
of
men
and
that
too
of
individuals
and
does
not
establish
an
article
of
faith
which
is
the
prerogative
of
god
alone
our
papists
however
cite
such
statements
opinions
of
men
in
order
that
men
should
believe
in
their
horrible
blasphemous
and
cursed
traffic
in
masses
for
souls
in
purgatory
or
in
sacrifices
for
the
dead
and
oblations
etc
but
they
will
never
prove
these
things
from
augustine
now
when
they
have
abolished
the
traffic
in
masses
for
purgatory
of
which
augustine
never
dreamt
we
will
then
discuss
with
them
whether
the
expressions
of
augustine
without
scripture
being
without
the
warrant
of
the
word
are
to
be
admitted
and
whether
the
dead
should
be
remembered
at
the
eucharist
for
it
will
not
do
to
frame
articles
of
faith
from
the
works
or
words
of
the
holy
fathers
otherwise
their
kind
of
fare
of
garments
of
house
would
have
to
become
an
article
of
faith
as
was
done
with
relies
we
have
however
another
rule
namely
the
rule
is
the
word
of
god
shall
establish
articles
of
faith
and
no
one
else
not
even
an
angel
secondly
from
this
it
has
followed
that
evil
spirits
have
perpetrated
much
knavery
exercised
their
malice
by
appearing
as
the
souls
of
the
departed
and
with
unspeakable
horrible
lies
and
tricks
demanded
masses
vigils
pilgrimages
and
other
alms
all
of
which
we
had
to
receive
as
articles
of
faith
and
to
live
accordingly
and
the
pope
confirmed
these
things
as
also
the
mass
and
all
other
abominations
here
too
there
is
no
can
not
and
must
not
be
any
yielding
or
surrendering
thirdly
hence
arose
the
pilgrimages
here
too
masses
the
remission
of
sins
and
the
grace
of
god
were
sought
for
the
mass
controlled
everything
now
it
is
indeed
certain
that
such
pilgrimages
without
the
word
of
god
have
not
been
commanded
us
neither
are
they
necessary
since
we
can
have
these
things
the
soul
can
be
cared
for
in
a
better
way
and
can
omit
these
pilgrimages
without
any
sin
and
danger
why
therefore
do
they
leave
at
home
desert
their
own
parish
their
called
ministers
their
parishes
the
word
of
god
wives
children
who
are
ordained
and
attention
to
whom
is
necessary
and
has
been
commanded
and
run
after
these
unnecessary
uncertain
pernicious
of
the
devil
and
errors
unless
the
devil
was
riding
made
insane
the
pope
causing
him
to
praise
and
establish
these
practices
whereby
the
people
again
and
again
revolted
from
christ
to
their
own
works
and
became
idolaters
which
is
worst
of
all
moreover
it
is
neither
necessary
nor
commanded
but
is
senseless
and
doubtful
and
besides
harmful
hence
here
too
there
can
be
no
yielding
or
surrendering
to
yield
or
concede
anything
here
is
not
lawful
etc
and
let
this
be
preached
that
such
pilgrimages
are
not
necessary
but
dangerous
and
then
see
what
will
become
of
them
for
thus
they
will
perish
of
their
own
accord
fourthly
fraternities
or
societies
in
which
cloisters
chapters
vicars
have
assigned
and
communicated
by
a
legal
contract
and
sale
all
masses
and
good
works
both
for
the
living
and
the
dead
this
is
not
only
altogether
a
human
bauble
without
the
word
of
god
entirely
unnecessary
and
not
commanded
but
also
contrary
to
the
chief
article
of
redemption
therefore
it
is
in
no
way
to
be
tolerated
fifthly
the
relics
in
which
there
are
found
so
many
falsehoods
and
tomfooleries
concerning
the
bones
of
dogs
and
horses
that
even
the
devil
has
laughed
at
such
rascalities
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
condemned
even
though
there
were
some
good
in
them
and
so
much
the
more
because
they
are
without
the
word
of
god
being
neither
commanded
nor
counseled
they
are
an
entirely
unnecessary
and
useless
thing
but
the
worst
is
that
they
have
imagined
that
these
relics
had
to
work
indulgence
and
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
have
revered
them
as
a
good
work
and
service
of
god
like
the
mass
etc
sixthly
here
belong
the
precious
indulgences
granted
but
only
for
money
both
to
the
living
and
the
dead
by
which
the
miserable
sacrilegious
and
accursed
judas
or
pope
has
sold
the
merit
of
christ
together
with
the
superfluous
merits
of
all
saints
and
of
the
entire
church
etc
all
these
things
and
every
single
one
of
them
are
not
to
be
borne
and
are
not
only
without
the
word
of
god
without
necessity
not
commanded
but
are
against
the
chief
article
for
the
merit
of
christ
is
apprehended
and
obtained
not
by
our
works
or
pence
but
from
grace
through
faith
without
money
and
merit
and
is
offered
and
presented
not
through
the
power
of
the
pope
but
through
the
preaching
of
god
word
of
the
invocation
of
saints
the
invocation
of
saints
is
also
one
of
the
abuses
of
antichrist
conflicting
with
the
chief
article
and
destroys
the
knowledge
of
christ
neither
is
it
commanded
nor
counseled
nor
has
it
any
example
or
testimony
in
scripture
and
even
though
it
were
a
precious
thing
as
it
is
not
while
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
most
harmful
thing
in
christ
we
have
everything
a
thousandfold
better
and
surer
so
that
we
are
not
in
need
of
calling
upon
the
saints
and
although
the
angels
in
heaven
pray
for
us
as
christ
himself
also
does
as
also
do
the
saints
on
earth
and
perhaps
also
in
heaven
yet
it
does
not
follow
thence
that
we
should
invoke
and
adore
the
angels
and
saints
and
fast
hold
festivals
celebrate
mass
in
their
honor
make
offerings
and
establish
churches
altars
divine
worship
and
in
still
other
ways
serve
them
and
regard
them
as
helpers
in
need
as
patrons
and
intercessors
and
divide
among
them
all
kinds
of
help
and
ascribe
to
each
one
a
particular
form
of
assistance
as
the
papists
teach
and
do
for
this
is
idolatry
and
such
honor
belongs
alone
to
god
for
as
a
christian
and
saint
upon
earth
you
can
pray
for
me
not
only
in
one
but
in
many
necessities
but
for
this
reason
i
am
not
obliged
to
adore
and
invoke
you
and
celebrate
festivals
fast
make
oblations
hold
masses
for
your
honor
and
worship
and
put
my
faith
in
you
for
my
salvation
i
can
in
other
ways
indeed
honor
love
and
thank
you
in
christ
if
now
such
idolatrous
honor
were
withdrawn
from
angels
and
departed
saints
the
remaining
honor
would
be
without
harm
and
would
quickly
be
forgotten
for
when
advantage
and
assistance
both
bodily
and
spiritual
are
no
more
to
be
expected
the
saints
will
not
be
troubled
the
worship
of
the
saints
will
soon
vanish
neither
in
their
graves
nor
in
heaven
for
without
a
reward
or
out
of
pure
love
no
one
will
much
remember
or
esteem
or
honor
them
bestow
on
them
divine
honor
in
short
the
mass
itself
and
anything
that
proceeds
from
it
and
anything
that
is
attached
to
it
we
can
not
tolerate
but
must
condemn
in
order
that
we
may
retain
the
holy
sacrament
pure
and
certain
according
to
the
institution
of
christ
employed
and
received
through
faith
article
iii
of
chapters
and
cloisters
that
chapters
and
cloisters
colleges
of
canons
and
communistic
dwellings
which
were
formerly
founded
with
the
good
intention
of
our
forefathers
to
educate
learned
men
and
chaste
and
modest
women
ought
again
to
be
turned
to
such
use
in
order
that
pastors
preachers
and
other
ministers
of
the
churches
may
be
had
and
likewise
other
necessary
persons
fitted
for
the
political
administration
of
the
secular
government
or
for
the
commonwealth
in
cities
and
countries
and
maidens
for
mothers
and
housekeepers
etc
if
they
will
not
serve
this
purpose
it
is
better
that
they
be
abandoned
or
razed
rather
than
continued
and
with
their
blasphemous
services
invented
by
men
regarded
as
something
better
than
the
ordinary
christian
life
and
the
offices
and
callings
ordained
by
god
for
all
this
also
is
contrary
to
the
first
chief
article
concerning
the
redemption
made
through
jesus
christ
add
to
this
that
like
all
other
human
inventions
these
have
neither
been
commanded
they
are
needless
and
useless
and
besides
afford
occasion
for
dangerous
and
vain
labor
dangerous
annoyances
and
fruitless
worship
such
services
as
the
prophets
call
aven
pain
and
labor
article
iv
of
the
papacy
that
the
pope
is
not
according
to
divine
law
or
according
to
the
word
of
god
the
head
of
all
christendom
for
this
name
belongs
to
one
only
whose
name
is
jesus
christ
but
is
only
the
bishop
and
pastor
of
the
church
at
rome
and
of
those
who
voluntarily
or
through
a
human
creature
that
is
a
political
magistrate
have
attached
themselves
to
him
to
be
christians
not
under
him
as
a
lord
but
with
him
as
brethren
colleagues
and
comrades
as
the
ancient
councils
and
the
age
of
cyprian
show
but
none
of
the
bishops
dare
to
address
the
pope
as
brother
as
was
done
at
that
time
in
the
age
of
cyprian
but
they
must
call
him
most
gracious
lord
even
though
they
be
kings
or
emperors
this
such
arrogance
we
will
not
can
not
must
not
take
upon
our
conscience
with
a
good
conscience
approve
let
him
however
who
will
do
it
do
so
without
us
at
his
own
risk
hence
it
follows
that
all
things
which
the
pope
from
a
power
so
false
mischievous
blasphemous
and
arrogant
has
done
and
undertaken
have
been
and
still
are
purely
diabolical
affairs
and
transactions
with
the
exception
of
such
things
as
pertain
to
the
secular
government
where
god
often
permits
much
good
to
be
effected
for
a
people
even
through
a
tyrant
and
faithless
scoundrel
for
the
ruin
of
the
entire
holy
catholic
or
christian
church
so
far
as
it
is
in
his
power
and
for
the
destruction
of
the
first
and
chief
article
concerning
the
redemption
made
through
jesus
christ
for
all
his
bulls
and
books
are
extant
in
which
he
roars
like
a
lion
as
the
angel
in
rev
depicts
him
crying
out
that
no
christian
can
be
saved
unless
he
obeys
him
and
is
subject
to
him
in
all
things
that
he
wishes
that
he
says
and
that
he
does
all
of
which
amounts
to
nothing
less
than
saying
although
you
believe
in
christ
and
have
in
him
alone
everything
that
is
necessary
to
salvation
yet
it
is
nothing
and
all
in
vain
unless
you
regard
have
and
worship
me
as
your
god
and
be
subject
and
obedient
to
me
and
yet
it
is
manifest
that
the
holy
church
has
been
without
the
pope
for
at
least
more
than
five
hundred
years
and
that
even
to
the
present
day
the
churches
of
the
greeks
and
of
many
other
languages
neither
have
been
nor
are
yet
under
the
pope
besides
as
often
remarked
it
is
a
human
figment
which
is
not
commanded
and
is
unnecessary
and
useless
for
the
holy
christian
or
catholic
church
can
exist
very
well
without
such
a
head
and
it
would
certainly
have
remained
better
purer
and
its
career
would
have
been
more
prosperous
if
such
a
head
had
not
been
raised
up
by
the
devil
and
the
papacy
is
also
of
no
use
in
the
church
because
it
exercises
no
christian
office
and
therefore
it
is
necessary
for
the
church
to
continue
and
to
exist
without
the
pope
and
supposing
that
the
pope
would
yield
this
point
so
as
not
to
be
supreme
by
divine
right
or
from
gods
command
but
that
we
must
have
there
must
be
elected
a
certain
head
to
whom
all
the
rest
adhere
as
their
support
in
order
that
the
concord
and
unity
of
christians
may
be
preserved
against
sects
and
heretics
and
that
such
a
head
were
chosen
by
men
and
that
it
were
placed
within
the
choice
and
power
of
men
to
change
or
remove
this
head
just
as
the
council
of
constance
adopted
nearly
this
course
with
reference
to
the
popes
deposing
three
and
electing
a
fourth
supposing
i
say
that
the
pope
and
see
at
rome
would
yield
and
accept
this
which
nevertheless
is
impossible
for
thus
he
would
have
to
suffer
his
entire
realm
and
estate
to
be
overthrown
and
destroyed
with
all
his
rights
and
books
a
thing
which
to
speak
in
few
words
he
can
not
do
nevertheless
even
in
this
way
christianity
would
not
be
helped
but
many
more
sects
would
arise
than
before
for
since
men
would
have
to
be
subject
to
this
head
not
from
god
command
but
from
their
personal
good
pleasure
it
would
easily
and
in
a
short
time
be
despised
and
at
last
retain
no
member
neither
would
it
have
to
be
forever
confined
to
rome
or
any
other
place
but
it
might
be
wherever
and
in
whatever
church
god
would
grant
a
man
fit
for
the
taking
upon
him
such
a
great
office
oh
the
complicated
and
confused
state
of
affairs
perplexity
that
would
result
therefore
the
church
can
never
be
better
governed
and
preserved
than
if
we
all
live
under
one
head
christ
and
all
the
bishops
equal
in
office
although
they
be
unequal
in
gifts
be
diligently
joined
in
unity
of
doctrine
faith
sacraments
prayer
and
works
of
love
as
jerome
writes
that
the
priests
at
alexandria
together
and
in
common
governed
the
churches
as
did
also
the
apostles
and
afterwards
all
bishops
throughout
all
christendom
until
the
pope
raised
his
head
above
all
this
teaching
shows
forcefully
that
the
pope
is
the
very
antichrist
who
has
exalted
himself
above
and
opposed
himself
against
christ
because
he
will
not
permit
christians
to
be
saved
without
his
power
which
nevertheless
is
nothing
and
is
neither
ordained
nor
commanded
by
god
this
is
properly
speaking
to
exalt
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
as
paul
says
thess
even
the
turks
or
the
tartars
great
enemies
of
christians
as
they
are
do
not
do
this
but
they
allow
whoever
wishes
to
believe
in
christ
and
take
bodily
tribute
and
obedience
from
christians
the
pope
however
prohibits
this
faith
saying
that
to
be
saved
a
person
must
obey
him
this
we
are
unwilling
to
do
even
though
on
this
account
we
must
die
in
god
s
name
this
all
proceeds
from
the
fact
that
the
pope
has
wished
to
be
called
the
supreme
head
of
the
christian
church
by
divine
right
accordingly
he
had
to
make
himself
equal
and
superior
to
christ
and
had
to
cause
himself
to
be
proclaimed
the
head
and
then
the
lord
of
the
church
and
finally
of
the
whole
world
and
simply
god
on
earth
until
he
has
dared
to
issue
commands
even
to
the
angels
in
heaven
and
when
we
distinguish
the
pope
s
teaching
from
or
measure
and
hold
it
against
holy
scripture
it
is
found
it
appears
plainly
that
the
pope
s
teaching
where
it
is
best
has
been
taken
from
the
imperial
and
heathen
law
and
treats
of
political
matters
and
decisions
or
rights
as
the
decretals
show
furthermore
it
teaches
of
ceremonies
concerning
churches
garments
food
persons
and
similar
puerile
theatrical
and
comical
things
without
measure
but
in
all
these
things
nothing
at
all
of
christ
faith
and
the
commandments
of
god
lastly
it
is
nothing
else
than
the
devil
himself
because
above
and
against
god
he
urges
and
disseminates
his
papal
falsehoods
concerning
masses
purgatory
the
monastic
life
one
own
works
and
fictitious
divine
worship
for
this
is
the
very
papacy
upon
each
of
which
the
papacy
is
altogether
founded
and
is
standing
and
condemns
murders
and
tortures
all
christians
who
do
not
exalt
and
honor
these
abominations
of
the
pope
above
all
things
therefore
just
as
little
as
we
can
worship
the
devil
himself
as
lord
and
god
we
can
endure
his
apostle
the
pope
or
antichrist
in
his
rule
as
head
or
lord
for
to
lie
and
to
kill
and
to
destroy
body
and
soul
eternally
that
is
wherein
his
papal
government
really
consists
as
i
have
very
clearly
shown
in
many
books
in
these
four
articles
they
will
have
enough
to
condemn
in
the
council
for
they
can
not
and
will
not
concede
us
even
the
least
point
in
one
of
these
articles
of
this
we
should
be
certain
and
animate
ourselves
with
be
forewarned
and
made
firm
in
the
hope
that
christ
our
lord
has
attacked
his
adversary
and
he
will
press
the
attack
home
pursue
and
destroy
him
both
by
his
spirit
and
coming
amen
for
in
the
council
we
will
stand
not
before
the
emperor
or
the
political
magistrate
as
at
augsburg
where
the
emperor
published
a
most
gracious
edict
and
caused
matters
to
be
heard
kindly
and
dispassionately
but
we
will
appear
before
the
pope
and
devil
himself
who
intends
to
listen
to
nothing
but
merely
when
the
case
has
been
publicly
announced
to
condemn
to
murder
and
to
force
us
to
idolatry
therefore
we
ought
not
here
to
kiss
his
feet
or
to
say
thou
art
my
gracious
lord
but
as
the
angel
in
zechariah
said
to
satan
the
lord
rebuke
thee
o
satan
the
third
part
of
the
articles
concerning
the
following
articles
we
may
will
be
able
to
treat
with
learned
and
reasonable
men
or
among
ourselves
the
pope
and
his
the
papal
government
do
not
care
much
about
these
for
with
them
conscience
is
nothing
but
money
glory
honors
power
are
to
them
everything
i
of
sin
here
we
must
confess
as
paul
says
in
rom
that
sin
originated
and
entered
the
world
from
one
man
adam
by
whose
disobedience
all
men
were
made
sinners
and
subject
to
death
and
the
devil
this
is
called
original
or
capital
sin
the
fruits
of
this
sin
are
afterwards
the
evil
deeds
which
are
forbidden
in
the
ten
commandments
such
as
distrust
unbelief
false
faith
idolatry
to
be
without
the
fear
of
god
presumption
recklessness
despair
blindness
or
complete
loss
of
sight
and
in
short
not
to
know
or
regard
god
furthermore
to
lie
to
swear
by
to
abuse
god
name
to
swear
falsely
not
to
pray
not
to
call
upon
god
not
to
regard
to
despise
or
neglect
god
word
to
be
disobedient
to
parents
to
murder
to
be
unchaste
to
steal
to
deceive
etc
this
hereditary
sin
is
so
deep
and
horrible
a
corruption
of
nature
that
no
reason
can
understand
it
but
it
must
be
learned
and
believed
from
the
revelation
of
scriptures
ps
rom
ff
ex
ff
hence
it
is
nothing
but
error
and
blindness
in
regard
to
this
article
what
the
scholastic
doctors
have
taught
namely
that
since
the
fall
of
adam
the
natural
powers
of
man
have
remained
entire
and
incorrupt
and
that
man
by
nature
has
a
right
reason
and
a
good
will
which
things
the
philosophers
teach
again
that
man
has
a
free
will
to
do
good
and
omit
evil
and
conversely
to
omit
good
and
do
evil
again
that
man
by
his
natural
powers
can
observe
and
keep
do
all
the
commands
of
god
again
that
by
his
natural
powers
man
can
love
god
above
all
things
and
his
neighbor
as
himself
again
if
a
man
does
as
much
as
is
in
him
god
certainly
grants
him
his
grace
again
if
he
wishes
to
go
to
the
sacrament
there
is
no
need
of
a
good
intention
to
do
good
but
it
is
sufficient
if
he
has
not
a
wicked
purpose
to
commit
sin
so
entirely
good
is
his
nature
and
so
efficacious
the
sacrament
again
that
it
is
not
founded
upon
scripture
that
for
a
good
work
the
holy
ghost
with
his
grace
is
necessary
such
and
many
similar
things
have
arisen
from
want
of
understanding
and
ignorance
as
regards
both
this
sin
and
christ
our
savior
and
they
are
truly
heathen
dogmas
which
we
can
not
endure
for
if
this
teaching
were
right
approved
then
christ
has
died
in
vain
since
there
is
in
man
no
defect
nor
sin
for
which
he
should
have
died
or
he
would
have
died
only
for
the
body
not
for
the
soul
inasmuch
as
the
soul
is
entirely
sound
and
the
body
only
is
subject
to
death
ii
of
the
law
here
we
hold
that
the
law
was
given
by
god
first
to
restrain
sin
by
threats
and
the
dread
of
punishment
and
by
the
promise
and
offer
of
grace
and
benefit
but
all
this
miscarried
on
account
of
the
wickedness
which
sin
has
wrought
in
man
for
thereby
a
part
some
were
rendered
worse
those
namely
who
are
hostile
to
hate
the
law
because
it
forbids
what
they
like
to
do
and
enjoins
what
they
do
not
like
to
do
therefore
wherever
they
can
escape
if
they
were
not
restrained
by
punishment
they
would
do
more
against
the
law
than
before
these
then
are
the
rude
and
wicked
unbridled
and
secure
men
who
do
evil
wherever
they
notice
that
they
have
the
opportunity
the
rest
become
blind
and
arrogant
are
smitten
with
arrogance
and
blindness
and
insolently
conceive
the
opinion
that
they
observe
and
can
observe
the
law
by
their
own
powers
as
has
been
said
above
concerning
the
scholastic
theologians
thence
come
the
hypocrites
and
or
false
saints
but
the
chief
office
or
force
of
the
law
is
that
it
reveal
original
sin
with
all
its
fruits
and
show
man
how
very
low
his
nature
has
fallen
and
has
become
fundamentally
and
utterly
corrupted
as
the
law
must
tell
man
that
he
has
no
god
nor
regards
cares
for
god
and
worships
other
gods
a
matter
which
before
and
without
the
law
he
would
not
have
believed
in
this
way
he
becomes
terrified
is
humbled
desponds
despairs
and
anxiously
desires
aid
but
sees
no
escape
he
begins
to
be
an
enemy
of
enraged
at
god
and
to
murmur
etc
this
is
what
paul
says
rom
the
law
worketh
wrath
and
rom
sin
is
increased
by
the
law
the
law
entered
that
the
offense
might
abound
iii
of
repentance
this
office
of
the
law
the
new
testament
retains
and
urges
as
paul
rom
does
saying
the
wrath
of
god
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
men
again
all
the
world
is
guilty
before
god
no
man
is
righteous
before
him
and
christ
says
john
the
holy
ghost
will
reprove
the
world
of
sin
this
then
is
the
thunderbolt
of
god
by
which
he
strikes
in
a
heap
hurls
to
the
ground
both
manifest
sinners
and
false
saints
hypocrites
and
suffers
no
one
to
be
in
the
right
declares
no
one
righteous
but
drives
them
all
together
to
terror
and
despair
this
is
the
hammer
as
jeremiah
says
is
not
my
word
like
a
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
in
pieces
this
is
not
activa
contritio
or
manufactured
repentance
but
passiva
contritio
torture
of
conscience
true
sorrow
of
heart
suffering
and
sensation
of
death
this
then
is
what
it
means
to
begin
true
repentance
and
here
man
must
hear
such
a
sentence
as
this
you
are
all
of
no
account
whether
you
be
manifest
sinners
or
saints
in
your
own
opinion
you
all
must
become
different
and
do
otherwise
than
you
now
are
and
are
doing
no
matter
what
sort
of
people
you
are
whether
you
are
as
great
wise
powerful
and
holy
as
you
may
here
no
one
is
righteous
holy
godly
etc
but
to
this
office
the
new
testament
immediately
adds
the
consolatory
promise
of
grace
through
the
gospel
which
must
be
believed
as
christ
declares
mark
repent
and
believe
the
gospel
become
different
and
do
otherwise
and
believe
my
promise
and
john
preceding
him
is
called
a
preacher
of
repentance
however
for
the
remission
of
sins
john
was
to
accuse
all
and
convict
them
of
being
sinners
that
they
might
know
what
they
were
before
god
and
might
acknowledge
that
they
were
lost
men
and
might
thus
be
prepared
for
the
lord
to
receive
grace
and
to
expect
and
accept
from
him
the
remission
of
sins
thus
also
christ
himself
says
luke
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
must
be
preached
in
my
name
among
all
nations
but
whenever
the
law
alone
without
the
gospel
being
added
exercises
this
its
office
there
is
nothing
else
than
death
and
hell
and
man
must
despair
like
saul
and
judas
as
paul
rom
says
through
sin
the
law
killeth
on
the
other
hand
the
gospel
brings
consolation
and
remission
not
only
in
one
way
but
through
the
word
and
sacraments
and
the
like
as
we
shall
hear
afterward
in
order
that
thus
there
is
with
the
lord
plenteous
redemption
as
ps
says
against
the
dreadful
captivity
of
sin
however
we
must
now
contrast
the
false
repentance
of
the
sophists
with
true
repentance
in
order
that
both
may
be
the
better
understood
of
the
false
repentance
of
the
papists
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
teach
correctly
concerning
repentance
since
they
did
not
rightly
know
the
real
sins
the
real
sin
for
as
has
been
shown
above
they
do
not
believe
aright
concerning
original
sin
but
say
that
the
natural
powers
of
man
have
remained
entirely
unimpaired
and
incorrupt
that
reason
can
teach
aright
and
the
will
can
in
accordance
therewith
do
aright
perform
those
things
which
are
taught
that
god
certainly
bestows
his
grace
when
a
man
does
as
much
as
is
in
him
according
to
his
free
will
it
had
to
follow
thence
from
this
dogma
that
they
did
must
do
penance
only
for
actual
sins
such
as
wicked
thoughts
to
which
a
person
yields
for
wicked
emotion
concupiscence
vicious
feelings
and
inclinations
lust
and
improper
dispositions
according
to
them
are
not
sins
and
for
wicked
words
and
wicked
deeds
which
free
will
could
readily
have
omitted
and
of
such
repentance
they
fix
three
parts
contrition
confession
and
satisfaction
with
this
magnificent
consolation
and
promise
added
if
man
truly
repent
feel
remorse
confess
render
satisfaction
he
thereby
would
have
merited
forgiveness
and
paid
for
his
sins
before
god
atoned
for
his
sins
and
obtained
a
plenary
redemption
thus
in
repentance
they
instructed
men
to
repose
confidence
in
their
own
works
hence
the
expression
originated
which
was
employed
in
the
pulpit
when
public
absolution
was
announced
to
the
people
prolong
o
god
my
life
until
i
shall
make
satisfaction
for
my
sins
and
amend
my
life
there
was
here
profound
silence
and
no
mention
of
christ
nor
faith
but
men
hoped
by
their
own
works
to
overcome
and
blot
out
sins
before
god
and
with
this
intention
we
became
priests
and
monks
that
we
might
array
ourselves
against
sin
as
to
contrition
this
is
the
way
it
was
done
since
no
one
could
remember
all
his
sins
especially
as
committed
through
an
entire
year
they
inserted
this
provision
namely
that
if
an
unknown
sin
should
be
remembered
later
if
the
remembrance
of
a
concealed
sin
should
perhaps
return
this
also
must
be
repented
of
and
confessed
etc
meanwhile
they
were
the
person
was
commended
to
the
grace
of
god
moreover
since
no
one
could
know
how
great
the
contrition
ought
to
be
in
order
to
be
sufficient
before
god
they
gave
this
consolation
he
who
could
not
have
contrition
at
least
ought
to
have
attrition
which
i
may
call
half
a
contrition
or
the
beginning
of
contrition
for
they
have
themselves
understood
neither
of
these
terms
nor
do
they
understand
them
now
as
little
as
i
such
attrition
was
reckoned
as
contrition
when
a
person
went
to
confession
and
when
it
happened
that
any
one
said
that
he
could
not
have
contrition
nor
lament
his
sins
as
might
have
occurred
in
illicit
love
or
the
desire
for
revenge
etc
they
asked
whether
he
did
not
wish
or
desire
to
have
contrition
lament
when
one
would
reply
yes
for
who
save
the
devil
himself
would
here
say
no
they
accepted
this
as
contrition
and
forgave
him
his
sins
on
account
of
this
good
work
of
his
which
they
adorned
with
the
name
of
contrition
here
they
cited
the
example
of
bernard
etc
here
we
see
how
blind
reason
in
matters
pertaining
to
god
gropes
about
and
according
to
its
own
imagination
seeks
for
consolation
in
its
own
works
and
can
not
think
of
entirely
forgets
christ
and
faith
but
if
it
be
clearly
viewed
in
the
light
this
contrition
is
a
manufactured
and
fictitious
thought
or
imagination
derived
from
man
own
powers
without
faith
and
without
the
knowledge
of
christ
and
in
it
the
poor
sinner
when
he
reflected
upon
his
own
lust
and
desire
for
revenge
would
sometimes
perhaps
have
laughed
rather
than
wept
either
laughed
or
wept
rather
than
to
think
of
something
else
except
such
as
either
had
been
truly
struck
by
the
lightning
of
the
law
or
had
been
vainly
vexed
by
the
devil
with
a
sorrowful
spirit
otherwise
with
the
exception
of
these
persons
such
contrition
was
certainly
mere
hypocrisy
and
did
not
mortify
the
lust
for
sins
flames
of
sin
for
they
had
to
grieve
while
they
would
rather
have
continued
to
sin
if
it
had
been
free
to
them
as
regards
confession
the
procedure
was
this
every
one
had
was
enjoined
to
enumerate
all
his
sins
which
is
an
impossible
thing
this
was
a
great
torment
from
such
as
he
had
forgotten
but
if
any
one
had
forgotten
some
sins
he
would
be
absolved
on
the
condition
that
if
they
would
occur
to
him
he
must
still
confess
them
in
this
way
he
could
never
know
whether
he
had
made
a
sufficiently
pure
confession
perfectly
and
correctly
or
when
confessing
would
ever
have
an
end
yet
he
was
pointed
to
his
own
works
and
comforted
thus
the
more
fully
sincerely
and
frankly
one
confesses
and
the
more
he
humiliates
himself
and
debases
himself
before
the
priest
the
sooner
and
better
he
renders
satisfaction
for
his
sins
for
such
humility
certainly
would
earn
grace
before
god
here
too
there
was
no
faith
nor
christ
and
the
virtue
of
the
absolution
was
not
declared
to
him
but
upon
his
enumeration
of
sins
and
his
depended
his
consolation
what
torture
rascality
and
idolatry
such
confession
has
produced
is
more
than
can
be
related
as
to
satisfaction
this
is
by
far
the
most
involved
perplexing
part
of
all
for
no
man
could
know
how
much
to
render
for
a
single
sin
not
to
say
how
much
for
all
here
they
have
resorted
to
the
device
of
imposing
a
small
satisfaction
which
could
indeed
be
rendered
as
five
paternosters
a
day
fast
etc
for
the
rest
that
was
lacking
of
the
in
their
repentance
they
were
directed
to
purgatory
here
too
there
was
nothing
but
anguish
and
extreme
misery
for
some
thought
that
they
would
never
get
out
of
purgatory
because
according
to
the
old
canons
seven
years
repentance
is
required
for
a
single
mortal
sin
nevertheless
confidence
was
placed
upon
our
work
of
satisfaction
and
if
the
satisfaction
could
have
been
perfect
confidence
would
have
been
placed
in
it
entirely
and
neither
faith
nor
christ
would
have
been
of
use
but
this
confidence
was
impossible
for
although
any
one
had
done
penance
in
that
way
for
a
hundred
years
he
would
still
not
have
known
whether
he
had
finished
his
penance
that
meant
forever
to
do
penance
and
never
to
come
to
repentance
here
now
the
holy
see
at
rome
coming
to
the
aid
of
the
poor
church
invented
indulgences
whereby
it
forgave
and
remitted
expiation
or
satisfaction
first
for
a
single
instance
for
seven
years
for
a
hundred
years
and
distributed
them
among
the
cardinals
and
bishops
so
that
one
could
grant
indulgence
for
a
hundred
years
and
another
for
a
hundred
days
but
he
reserved
to
himself
alone
the
power
to
remit
the
entire
satisfaction
now
since
this
began
to
yield
money
and
the
traffic
in
bulls
became
profitable
he
devised
the
golden
jubilee
year
a
truly
goldbearing
year
and
fixed
it
at
rome
he
called
this
the
remission
of
all
punishment
and
guilt
then
the
people
came
running
because
every
one
would
fain
have
been
freed
from
this
grievous
unbearable
burden
this
meant
to
find
dig
up
and
raise
the
treasures
of
the
earth
immediately
the
pope
pressed
still
further
and
multiplied
the
golden
years
one
upon
another
but
the
more
he
devoured
money
the
wider
grew
his
maw
later
therefore
he
issued
them
those
golden
years
of
his
by
his
legates
everywhere
to
the
countries
until
all
churches
and
houses
were
full
of
the
golden
year
at
last
he
also
made
an
inroad
into
purgatory
among
the
dead
first
by
founding
masses
and
vigils
afterwards
by
indulgences
and
the
golden
year
and
finally
souls
became
so
cheap
that
he
released
one
for
a
farthing
but
all
this
too
was
of
no
avail
for
although
the
pope
taught
men
to
depend
upon
and
trust
in
these
indulgences
for
salvation
yet
he
rendered
the
whole
matter
again
uncertain
for
in
his
bulls
he
declares
whoever
would
share
in
the
indulgences
or
a
golden
year
must
be
contrite
and
have
confessed
and
pay
money
now
we
have
heard
above
that
this
contrition
and
confession
are
with
them
uncertain
and
hypocrisy
likewise
also
no
one
knew
what
soul
was
in
purgatory
and
if
some
were
therein
no
one
knew
which
had
properly
repented
and
confessed
thus
he
took
the
precious
money
the
pope
snatched
up
the
holy
pence
and
comforted
them
meanwhile
with
led
them
to
confidence
in
his
power
and
indulgence
and
then
again
led
them
away
from
that
and
directed
them
again
to
their
uncertain
work
if
now
although
there
were
some
who
did
not
believe
acknowledge
themselves
guilty
of
such
actual
sins
in
committed
by
thoughts
words
and
works
as
i
and
such
as
i
in
monasteries
and
chapters
fraternities
or
colleges
of
priests
wished
to
be
monks
and
priests
and
by
fasting
watching
praying
saying
mass
coarse
garments
and
hard
beds
fought
against
strove
to
resist
evil
thoughts
and
in
full
earnest
and
with
force
wanted
to
be
holy
and
yet
the
hereditary
inborn
evil
sometimes
did
in
sleep
what
it
is
wont
to
do
as
also
augustine
and
jerome
among
others
confess
still
each
one
held
the
other
in
esteem
so
that
some
according
to
our
teaching
were
regarded
as
holy
without
sin
and
full
of
good
works
so
much
so
that
with
this
mind
we
would
communicate
and
sell
our
good
works
to
others
as
being
superfluous
to
us
for
heaven
this
is
indeed
true
and
seals
letters
and
instances
that
this
happened
are
at
hand
when
there
were
such
i
say
these
did
not
need
repentance
for
of
what
would
they
repent
since
they
had
not
indulged
wicked
thoughts
what
would
they
confess
concerning
words
not
uttered
since
they
had
avoided
words
for
what
should
they
render
satisfaction
since
they
were
so
guiltless
of
any
deed
that
they
could
even
sell
their
superfluous
righteousness
to
other
poor
sinners
such
saints
were
also
the
pharisees
and
scribes
in
the
time
of
christ
here
comes
the
fiery
angel
john
rev
the
true
preacher
of
true
repentance
and
with
one
thunderclap
and
bolt
hurls
both
those
selling
and
those
buying
works
on
one
heap
and
says
repent
matt
now
the
former
the
poor
wretches
imagine
why
we
have
repented
the
latter
the
rest
say
we
need
no
repentance
john
says
repent
ye
both
of
you
for
ye
are
false
penitents
so
are
these
the
rest
false
saints
or
hypocrites
and
all
of
you
on
either
side
need
the
forgiveness
of
sins
because
neither
of
you
know
what
true
sin
is
not
to
say
anything
about
your
duty
to
repent
of
it
and
shun
it
for
no
one
of
you
is
good
you
are
full
of
unbelief
stupidity
and
ignorance
of
god
and
god
will
for
here
he
is
present
of
whose
fulness
have
all
we
received
and
grace
for
grace
john
and
without
him
no
man
can
be
just
before
god
therefore
if
you
wish
to
repent
repent
your
penance
will
not
accomplish
anything
is
nothing
and
you
hypocrites
who
do
not
need
repentance
you
serpents
brood
who
has
assured
you
that
you
will
escape
the
wrath
to
come
etc
matt
luke
in
the
same
way
paul
also
preaches
rom
there
is
none
righteous
there
is
none
that
understandeth
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
god
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
they
are
all
gone
out
of
the
way
they
are
together
become
unprofitable
and
acts
god
now
commandeth
all
men
everywhere
to
repent
all
men
he
says
no
one
excepted
who
is
a
man
this
repentance
teaches
us
to
discern
sin
namely
that
we
are
altogether
lost
and
that
there
is
nothing
good
in
us
from
head
to
foot
both
within
and
without
and
that
we
must
absolutely
become
new
and
other
men
this
repentance
is
not
piecemeal
partial
and
beggarly
fragmentary
like
that
which
does
penance
for
actual
sins
nor
is
it
uncertain
like
that
for
it
does
not
debate
what
is
or
is
not
sin
but
hurls
everything
on
a
heap
and
says
all
in
us
is
nothing
but
sin
affirms
that
with
respect
to
us
all
is
simply
sin
and
there
is
nothing
in
us
that
is
not
sin
and
guilt
what
is
the
use
of
for
why
do
we
wish
investigating
dividing
or
distinguishing
a
long
time
for
this
reason
too
this
contrition
is
not
doubtful
or
uncertain
for
there
is
nothing
left
with
which
we
can
think
of
any
good
thing
to
pay
for
sin
but
there
is
only
a
sure
despairing
concerning
all
that
we
are
think
speak
or
do
all
hope
must
be
cast
aside
in
respect
of
everything
etc
in
like
manner
confession
too
can
not
be
false
uncertain
or
piecemeal
mutilated
or
fragmentary
for
he
who
confesses
that
all
in
him
is
nothing
but
sin
comprehends
all
sins
excludes
none
forgets
none
neither
can
the
satisfaction
be
uncertain
because
it
is
not
our
uncertain
sinful
work
but
it
is
the
suffering
and
blood
of
the
spotless
and
innocent
lamb
of
god
who
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
of
this
repentance
john
preaches
and
afterwards
christ
in
the
gospel
and
we
also
by
this
preaching
of
repentance
we
dash
to
the
ground
the
pope
and
everything
that
is
built
upon
our
good
works
for
all
is
built
upon
a
rotten
and
vain
foundation
which
is
called
a
good
work
or
law
even
though
no
good
work
is
there
but
only
wicked
works
and
no
one
does
the
law
as
christ
john
says
but
all
transgress
it
therefore
the
building
that
is
raised
upon
it
is
nothing
but
falsehood
and
hypocrisy
even
in
the
part
where
it
is
most
holy
and
beautiful
and
in
christians
this
repentance
continues
until
death
because
through
the
entire
life
it
contends
with
sin
remaining
in
the
flesh
as
paul
rom
shows
testifies
that
he
wars
with
the
law
in
his
members
etc
and
that
not
by
his
own
powers
but
by
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
that
follows
the
remission
of
sins
this
gift
daily
cleanses
and
sweeps
out
the
remaining
sins
and
works
so
as
to
render
man
truly
pure
and
holy
the
pope
the
theologians
the
jurists
and
every
other
man
know
nothing
of
this
from
their
own
reason
but
it
is
a
doctrine
from
heaven
revealed
through
the
gospel
and
must
suffer
to
be
called
heresy
by
the
godless
saints
or
hypocrites
on
the
other
hand
if
certain
sectarists
would
arise
some
of
whom
are
perhaps
already
extant
and
in
the
time
of
the
insurrection
of
the
peasants
came
to
my
own
view
holding
that
all
those
who
had
once
received
the
spirit
or
the
forgiveness
of
sins
or
had
become
believers
even
though
they
should
afterwards
sin
would
still
remain
in
the
faith
and
such
sin
would
not
harm
them
and
hence
crying
thus
do
whatever
you
please
if
you
believe
it
all
amounts
to
nothing
faith
blots
out
all
sins
they
say
besides
that
if
any
one
sins
after
he
has
received
faith
and
the
spirit
he
never
truly
had
the
spirit
and
faith
i
have
had
before
me
seen
and
heard
many
such
insane
men
and
i
fear
that
in
some
such
a
devil
is
still
remaining
hiding
and
dwelling
it
is
accordingly
necessary
to
know
and
to
teach
that
when
holy
men
still
having
and
feeling
original
sin
also
daily
repenting
of
and
striving
with
it
happen
to
fall
into
manifest
sins
as
david
into
adultery
murder
and
blasphemy
that
then
faith
and
the
holy
ghost
has
departed
from
them
they
cast
out
faith
and
the
holy
ghost
for
the
holy
ghost
does
not
permit
sin
to
have
dominion
to
gain
the
upper
hand
so
as
to
be
accomplished
but
represses
and
restrains
it
so
that
it
must
not
do
what
it
wishes
but
if
it
does
what
it
wishes
the
holy
ghost
and
faith
are
certainly
not
present
for
john
says
ep
whosoever
is
born
of
god
doth
not
commit
sin
and
he
can
not
sin
and
yet
it
is
also
the
truth
when
the
same
john
says
ep
if
we
say
that
we
have
no
sin
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
iv
of
the
gospel
we
will
now
return
to
the
gospel
which
not
merely
in
one
way
gives
us
counsel
and
aid
against
sin
for
god
is
superabundantly
rich
and
liberal
in
his
grace
and
goodness
first
through
the
spoken
word
by
which
the
forgiveness
of
sins
is
preached
he
commands
to
be
preached
in
the
whole
world
which
is
the
peculiar
office
of
the
gospel
secondly
through
baptism
thirdly
through
the
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
fourthly
through
the
power
of
the
keys
and
also
through
the
mutual
conversation
and
consolation
of
brethren
matt
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
etc
of
baptism
baptism
is
nothing
else
than
the
word
of
god
in
the
water
commanded
by
his
institution
or
as
paul
says
a
washing
in
the
word
as
also
augustine
says
let
the
word
come
to
the
element
and
it
becomes
a
sacrament
and
for
this
reason
we
do
not
hold
with
thomas
and
the
monastic
preachers
or
dominicans
who
forget
the
word
god
institution
and
say
that
god
has
imparted
to
the
water
a
spiritual
power
which
through
the
water
washes
away
sin
nor
do
we
agree
with
scotus
and
the
barefooted
monks
minorites
or
franciscan
monks
who
teach
that
by
the
assistance
of
the
divine
will
baptism
washes
away
sins
and
that
this
ablution
occurs
only
through
the
will
of
god
and
by
no
means
through
the
word
or
water
of
the
baptism
of
children
we
hold
that
children
ought
to
be
baptized
for
they
belong
to
the
promised
redemption
made
through
christ
and
the
church
should
administer
it
baptism
and
the
announcement
of
that
promise
to
them
vi
of
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
of
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
we
hold
that
bread
and
wine
in
the
supper
are
the
true
body
and
blood
of
christ
and
are
given
and
received
not
only
by
the
godly
but
also
by
wicked
christians
and
that
not
only
one
form
is
to
be
given
for
we
do
not
need
that
high
art
specious
wisdom
which
is
to
teach
us
that
under
the
one
form
there
is
as
much
as
under
both
as
the
sophists
and
the
council
of
constance
teach
for
even
if
it
were
true
that
there
is
as
much
under
one
as
under
both
yet
the
one
form
only
is
not
the
entire
ordinance
and
institution
made
ordained
and
commanded
by
christ
and
we
especially
condemn
and
in
god
name
execrate
those
who
not
only
omit
both
forms
but
also
quite
autocratically
tyrannically
prohibit
condemn
and
blaspheme
them
as
heresy
and
so
exalt
themselves
against
and
above
christ
our
lord
and
god
opposing
and
placing
themselves
ahead
of
christ
etc
as
regards
transubstantiation
we
care
nothing
about
the
sophistical
subtlety
by
which
they
teach
that
bread
and
wine
leave
or
lose
their
own
natural
substance
and
that
there
remain
only
the
appearance
and
color
of
bread
and
not
true
bread
for
it
is
in
perfect
agreement
with
holy
scriptures
that
there
is
and
remains
bread
as
paul
himself
calls
it
cor
the
bread
which
we
break
and
cor
let
him
so
eat
of
that
bread
vii
of
the
keys
the
keys
are
an
office
and
power
given
by
christ
to
the
church
for
binding
and
loosing
sin
not
only
the
gross
and
sins
but
also
the
subtle
hidden
which
are
known
only
to
god
as
it
is
written
in
ps
who
can
understand
his
errors
and
in
rom
paul
himself
complains
that
with
the
flesh
he
serves
the
law
of
sin
for
it
is
not
in
our
power
but
belongs
to
god
alone
to
judge
which
how
great
and
how
many
the
sins
are
as
it
is
written
in
ps
enter
not
into
judgment
with
thy
servant
for
in
thy
sight
shall
no
man
living
be
justified
and
paul
cor
says
for
i
know
nothing
by
myself
yet
am
i
not
hereby
justified
viii
of
confession
since
absolution
or
the
power
of
the
keys
is
also
an
aid
and
consolation
against
sin
and
a
bad
conscience
ordained
by
christ
himself
in
the
gospel
confession
or
absolution
ought
by
no
means
to
be
abolished
in
the
church
especially
on
account
of
tender
and
timid
consciences
and
on
account
of
the
untrained
and
capricious
young
people
in
order
that
they
may
be
examined
and
instructed
in
the
christian
doctrine
but
the
enumeration
of
sins
ought
to
be
free
to
every
one
as
to
what
he
wishes
to
enumerate
or
not
to
enumerate
for
as
long
as
we
are
in
the
flesh
we
shall
not
lie
when
we
say
i
am
a
poor
man
i
acknowledge
that
i
am
a
miserable
sinner
full
of
sin
rom
i
see
another
law
in
my
members
etc
for
since
private
absolution
originates
in
the
office
of
the
keys
it
should
not
be
despised
neglected
but
greatly
and
highly
esteemed
of
the
greatest
worth
as
also
all
other
offices
of
the
christian
church
and
in
those
things
which
concern
the
spoken
outward
word
we
must
firmly
hold
that
god
grants
his
spirit
or
grace
to
no
one
except
through
or
with
the
preceding
outward
word
in
order
that
we
may
thus
be
protected
against
the
enthusiasts
spirits
who
boast
that
they
have
the
spirit
without
and
before
the
word
and
accordingly
judge
scripture
or
the
spoken
word
and
explain
and
stretch
it
at
their
pleasure
as
muenzer
did
and
many
still
do
at
the
present
day
who
wish
to
be
acute
judges
between
the
spirit
and
the
letter
and
yet
know
not
what
they
say
or
declare
for
indeed
the
papacy
also
is
nothing
but
sheer
enthusiasm
by
which
the
pope
boasts
that
all
rights
exist
in
the
shrine
of
his
heart
and
whatever
he
decides
and
commands
with
in
his
church
is
spirit
and
right
even
though
it
is
above
and
contrary
to
scripture
and
the
spoken
word
all
this
is
the
old
devil
and
old
serpent
who
also
converted
adam
and
eve
into
enthusiasts
and
led
them
from
the
outward
word
of
god
to
spiritualizing
and
and
nevertheless
he
accomplished
this
through
other
outward
words
just
as
also
our
enthusiasts
at
the
present
day
condemn
the
outward
word
and
nevertheless
they
themselves
are
not
silent
but
they
fill
the
world
with
their
pratings
and
writings
as
though
indeed
the
spirit
could
not
come
through
the
writings
and
spoken
word
of
the
apostles
but
first
through
their
writings
and
words
he
must
come
why
then
do
not
they
also
omit
their
own
sermons
and
writings
until
the
spirit
himself
come
to
men
without
their
writings
and
before
them
as
they
boast
that
me
has
come
into
them
without
the
preaching
of
the
scriptures
but
of
these
matters
there
is
not
time
now
to
dispute
at
greater
length
we
have
elsewhere
sufficiently
urged
this
subject
for
even
those
who
believe
before
baptism
or
become
believing
in
baptism
believe
through
the
preceding
outward
word
as
the
adults
who
have
come
to
reason
must
first
have
heard
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
even
though
they
are
at
first
unbelieving
and
receive
the
spirit
and
baptism
ten
years
afterwards
cornelius
acts
had
heard
long
before
among
the
jews
of
the
coming
messiah
through
whom
he
was
righteous
before
god
and
in
such
faith
his
prayers
and
alms
were
acceptable
to
god
as
luke
calls
him
devout
and
and
without
such
preceding
word
and
hearing
could
not
have
believed
or
been
righteous
but
peter
had
to
reveal
to
him
that
the
messiah
in
whom
as
one
that
was
to
come
he
had
hitherto
believed
now
had
come
lest
his
faith
concerning
the
coming
messiah
hold
him
captive
among
the
hardened
and
unbelieving
jews
but
know
that
he
was
now
to
be
saved
by
the
present
messiah
and
must
not
with
the
rabble
of
the
jews
deny
nor
persecute
him
in
a
word
enthusiasm
inheres
in
adam
and
his
children
from
the
beginning
from
the
first
fall
to
the
end
of
the
world
its
poison
having
been
implanted
and
infused
into
them
by
the
old
dragon
and
is
the
origin
power
life
and
strength
of
all
heresy
especially
of
that
of
the
papacy
and
mahomet
therefore
we
ought
and
must
constantly
maintain
this
point
that
god
does
not
wish
to
deal
with
us
otherwise
than
through
the
spoken
word
and
the
sacraments
it
is
the
devil
himself
whatsoever
is
extolled
as
spirit
without
the
word
and
sacraments
for
god
wished
to
appear
even
to
moses
through
the
burning
bush
and
spoken
word
and
no
prophet
neither
elijah
nor
elisha
received
the
spirit
without
the
ten
commandments
or
spoken
word
neither
was
john
the
baptist
conceived
without
the
preceding
word
of
gabriel
nor
did
he
leap
in
his
mother
womb
without
the
voice
of
mary
and
peter
says
ep
the
prophecy
came
not
by
the
will
of
man
but
holy
men
of
god
spake
as
they
were
moved
by
the
holy
ghost
without
the
outward
word
however
they
were
not
holy
much
less
would
the
holy
ghost
have
moved
them
to
speak
when
they
still
were
unholy
or
profane
for
they
were
holy
says
he
since
the
holy
ghost
spake
through
them
ix
of
excommunication
the
greater
excommunication
as
the
pope
calls
it
we
regard
only
as
a
civil
penalty
and
it
does
not
concern
us
ministers
of
the
church
but
the
lesser
that
is
the
true
christian
excommunication
consists
in
this
that
manifest
and
obstinate
sinners
are
not
admitted
to
the
sacrament
and
other
communion
of
the
church
until
they
amend
their
lives
and
avoid
sin
and
ministers
ought
not
to
mingle
secular
punishments
with
this
ecclesiastical
punishment
or
excommunication
x
of
ordination
and
the
call
if
the
bishops
would
be
true
bishops
would
rightly
discharge
their
office
and
would
devote
themselves
to
the
church
and
the
gospel
it
might
be
granted
to
them
for
the
sake
of
love
and
unity
but
not
from
necessity
to
ordain
and
confirm
us
and
our
preachers
omitting
however
all
comedies
and
spectacular
display
deceptions
absurdities
and
appearances
of
unchristian
heathenish
parade
and
pomp
but
because
they
neither
are
nor
wish
to
be
true
bishops
but
worldly
lords
and
princes
who
will
neither
preach
nor
teach
nor
baptize
nor
administer
the
lord
supper
nor
perform
any
work
or
office
of
the
church
and
moreover
persecute
and
condemn
those
who
discharge
these
functions
having
been
called
to
do
so
the
church
ought
not
on
their
account
to
remain
without
ministers
to
be
forsaken
by
or
deprived
of
ministers
therefore
as
the
ancient
examples
of
the
church
and
the
fathers
teach
us
we
ourselves
will
and
ought
to
ordain
suitable
persons
to
this
office
and
even
according
to
their
own
laws
they
have
not
the
right
to
forbid
or
prevent
us
for
their
laws
say
that
those
ordained
even
by
heretics
should
be
declared
truly
ordained
and
stay
ordained
and
that
such
ordination
must
not
be
changed
as
jerome
writes
of
the
church
at
alexandria
that
at
first
it
was
governed
in
common
by
priests
and
preachers
without
bishops
xi
of
the
marriage
of
priests
to
prohibit
marriage
and
to
burden
the
divine
order
of
priests
with
perpetual
celibacy
they
have
had
neither
authority
nor
right
they
have
done
out
of
malice
without
any
honest
reason
but
have
acted
like
antichristian
tyrannical
desperate
scoundrels
have
performed
the
work
of
antichrist
of
tyrants
and
the
worst
knaves
and
have
thereby
caused
all
kinds
of
horrible
abominable
innumerable
sins
of
unchastity
depraved
lusts
in
which
they
still
wallow
now
as
little
as
we
or
they
have
been
given
the
power
to
make
a
woman
out
of
a
man
or
a
man
out
of
a
woman
or
to
nullify
either
sex
so
little
have
they
had
the
power
to
sunder
and
separate
such
creatures
of
god
or
to
forbid
them
from
living
and
cohabiting
honestly
in
marriage
with
one
another
therefore
we
are
unwilling
to
assent
to
their
abominable
celibacy
nor
will
we
even
tolerate
it
but
we
wish
to
have
marriage
free
as
god
has
instituted
and
ordained
it
and
we
wish
neither
to
rescind
nor
hinder
his
work
for
paul
says
tim
that
this
prohibition
of
marriage
is
a
doctrine
of
devils
xii
of
the
church
we
do
not
concede
to
them
that
they
are
the
church
and
in
truth
they
are
not
the
church
nor
will
we
listen
to
those
things
which
under
the
name
of
church
they
enjoin
or
forbid
for
thank
god
a
child
seven
years
old
knows
what
the
church
is
namely
the
holy
believers
and
lambs
who
hear
the
voice
of
their
shepherd
for
the
children
pray
thus
i
believe
in
one
holy
catholic
or
christian
church
this
holiness
does
not
consist
in
albs
tonsures
long
gowns
and
other
of
their
ceremonies
devised
by
them
beyond
holy
scripture
but
in
the
word
of
god
and
true
faith
xiii
how
one
is
justified
before
god
and
of
good
works
what
i
have
hitherto
and
constantly
taught
concerning
this
i
know
not
how
to
change
in
the
least
namely
that
by
faith
as
peter
says
we
acquire
a
new
and
clean
heart
and
god
will
and
does
account
us
entirely
righteous
and
holy
for
the
sake
of
christ
our
mediator
and
although
sin
in
the
flesh
has
not
yet
been
altogether
removed
or
become
dead
yet
he
will
not
punish
or
remember
it
and
such
faith
renewal
and
forgiveness
of
sins
is
followed
by
good
works
and
what
there
is
still
sinful
or
imperfect
also
in
them
shall
not
be
accounted
as
sin
or
defect
even
and
that
too
for
christ
sake
but
the
entire
man
both
as
to
his
person
and
his
works
is
to
be
called
and
to
be
righteous
and
holy
from
pure
grace
and
mercy
shed
upon
us
unfolded
and
spread
over
us
in
christ
therefore
we
can
not
boast
of
many
merits
and
works
if
they
are
viewed
apart
from
grace
and
mercy
but
as
it
is
written
cor
he
that
glorieth
let
him
glory
in
the
lord
namely
that
he
has
a
gracious
god
for
thus
all
is
well
we
say
besides
that
if
good
works
do
not
follow
faith
is
false
and
not
true
xiv
of
monastic
vows
as
monastic
vows
directly
conflict
with
the
first
chief
article
they
must
be
absolutely
abolished
for
it
is
of
them
that
christ
says
matt
ff
i
am
christ
etc
for
he
who
makes
a
vow
to
live
as
a
monk
believes
that
he
will
enter
upon
a
mode
of
life
holier
than
ordinary
christians
lead
and
wishes
to
earn
heaven
by
his
own
works
not
only
for
himself
but
also
for
others
this
is
to
deny
christ
and
they
boast
from
their
thomas
that
a
monastic
vow
is
equal
to
baptism
this
is
blasphemy
against
god
xv
of
human
traditions
the
declaration
of
the
papists
that
human
traditions
serve
for
the
remission
of
sins
or
merit
salvation
is
altogether
unchristian
and
condemned
as
christ
says
matt
in
vain
they
do
worship
me
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
men
again
titus
that
turn
from
the
truth
again
when
they
declare
that
it
is
a
mortal
sin
if
one
breaks
these
ordinances
does
not
keep
these
statutes
this
too
is
not
right
these
are
the
articles
on
which
i
must
stand
and
god
willing
shall
stand
even
to
my
death
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
change
or
to
yield
anything
in
them
if
any
one
wishes
to
yield
anything
let
him
do
it
at
the
peril
of
his
conscience
lastly
there
still
remains
the
pope
bag
of
impostures
concerning
foolish
and
childish
articles
as
the
dedication
of
churches
the
baptism
of
bells
the
baptism
of
the
altarstone
and
the
inviting
of
sponsors
to
these
rites
who
would
make
donations
towards
them
such
baptizing
is
a
reproach
and
mockery
of
holy
baptism
hence
should
not
be
tolerated
furthermore
concerning
the
consecration
of
cakes
oats
herbs
spices
which
indeed
can
not
be
called
consecrations
but
are
sheer
mockery
and
fraud
and
such
deceptions
there
are
without
number
which
we
commend
for
adoration
to
their
god
and
to
themselves
until
they
weary
of
it
we
will
ought
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
