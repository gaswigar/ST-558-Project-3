introductory
note
jean
baptiste
racine
the
younger
contemporary
of
corneille
and
his
rival
for
supremacy
in
french
classical
tragedy
was
born
at
december
he
was
educated
at
the
college
of
beauvais
at
the
great
jansenist
school
at
port
royal
and
at
the
college
he
attracted
notice
by
an
ode
written
for
the
marriage
of
louis
xiv
in
and
made
his
first
really
great
dramatic
success
with
his
andromaque
his
tragic
masterpieces
include
britannicus
berenice
bajazet
mithridate
iphigenie
and
phaedre
all
written
between
and
then
for
some
years
he
gave
up
dramatic
composition
disgusted
by
the
intrigues
of
enemies
who
sought
to
injure
his
career
by
exalting
above
him
an
unworthy
rival
in
he
resumed
his
work
under
the
persuasion
of
mme
de
maintenon
and
produced
esther
and
athalie
the
latter
ranking
among
his
finest
productions
although
it
did
not
receive
public
recognition
until
some
time
after
his
death
in
besides
his
tragedies
racine
wrote
one
comedy
les
plaideurs
four
hymns
of
great
beauty
and
a
history
of
port
royal
the
external
conventions
of
classical
tragedy
which
had
been
established
by
corneille
racine
did
not
attempt
to
modify
his
study
of
the
greek
tragedians
and
his
own
taste
led
him
to
submit
willingly
to
the
rigor
and
simplicity
of
form
which
were
the
fundamental
marks
of
the
classical
ideal
it
was
in
his
treatment
of
character
that
he
differed
most
from
his
predecessor
for
whereas
as
we
have
seen
corneille
represented
his
leading
figures
as
heroically
subduing
passion
by
force
of
will
racine
represents
his
as
driven
by
almost
uncontrollable
passion
thus
his
creations
appeal
to
the
modern
reader
as
more
warmly
human
their
speech
if
less
exalted
is
simpler
and
more
natural
and
he
succeeds
more
brilliantly
with
his
portraits
of
women
than
with
those
of
men
all
these
characteristics
are
exemplified
in
phaedre
the
tragedy
of
racine
which
has
made
an
appeal
to
the
widest
audience
to
the
legend
as
treated
by
euripides
racine
added
the
love
of
hippolytus
for
aricia
and
thus
supplied
a
motive
for
phaedra
jealousy
and
at
the
same
time
he
made
the
nurse
instead
of
phaedra
the
calumniator
of
his
son
to
theseus
phaedra
characters
theseus
son
of
aegeus
and
king
of
athens
phaedra
wife
of
theseus
and
daughter
of
minos
and
pasiphae
hippolytus
son
of
theseus
and
antiope
queen
of
the
amazons
aricia
princess
of
the
blood
royal
of
athens
oenone
nurse
of
phaedra
theramenes
tutor
of
hippolytus
ismene
bosom
friend
of
aricia
panope
of
phaedra
guards
the
scene
is
laid
at
troezen
a
town
of
the
peloponnesus
act
i
scene
i
hippolytus
theramenes
hippolytus
my
mind
is
settled
dear
theramenes
and
i
can
stay
no
more
in
lovely
troezen
in
doubt
that
racks
my
soul
with
mortal
anguish
i
grow
ashamed
of
such
long
idleness
six
months
and
more
my
father
has
been
gone
and
what
may
have
befallen
one
so
dear
i
know
not
nor
what
corner
of
the
earth
hides
him
theramenes
and
where
prince
will
you
look
for
him
already
to
content
your
just
alarm
have
i
not
cross
the
seas
on
either
side
of
corinth
ask
if
aught
were
known
of
theseus
where
acheron
is
lost
among
the
shades
visited
elis
doubled
toenarus
and
sail
into
the
sea
that
saw
the
fall
of
icarus
inspired
with
what
new
hope
under
what
favour
skies
think
you
to
trace
his
footsteps
who
knows
if
the
king
your
father
wishes
the
secret
of
his
absence
known
perchance
while
we
are
trembling
for
his
life
the
hero
calmly
plots
some
fresh
intrigue
and
only
waits
till
the
deluded
fair
hippolytus
cease
dear
theramenes
respect
the
name
of
theseus
youthful
errors
have
been
left
behind
and
no
unworthy
obstacle
detains
him
phaedra
long
has
fix
a
heart
inconstant
once
nor
need
she
fear
a
rival
in
seeking
him
i
shall
but
do
my
duty
and
leave
a
place
i
dare
no
longer
see
theramenes
indeed
when
prince
did
you
begin
to
dread
these
peaceful
haunts
so
dear
to
happy
childhood
where
i
have
seen
you
oft
prefer
to
stay
rather
than
meet
the
tumult
and
the
pomp
of
athens
and
the
court
what
danger
shun
you
or
shall
i
say
what
grief
hippolytus
that
happy
time
is
gone
and
all
is
changed
since
to
these
shores
the
gods
sent
phaedra
theramenes
i
perceive
the
cause
of
your
distress
it
is
the
queen
whose
sight
offends
you
with
a
spite
she
schemed
your
exile
soon
as
she
set
eyes
on
you
but
if
her
hatred
is
not
wholly
vanish
it
has
at
least
taken
a
milder
aspect
besides
what
danger
can
a
dying
woman
one
too
who
longs
for
death
bring
on
your
head
can
phaedra
of
a
dire
disease
of
which
she
will
not
speak
weary
of
life
and
of
herself
form
any
plots
against
you
hippolytus
it
is
not
her
vain
enmity
i
fear
another
foe
alarms
hippolytus
i
fly
it
must
be
own
from
young
aricia
the
sole
survivor
of
an
impious
race
theramenes
what
you
become
her
persecutor
too
the
gentle
sister
of
the
cruel
sons
of
pallas
shared
not
in
their
perfidy
why
should
you
hate
such
charming
innocence
hippolytus
i
should
not
need
to
fly
if
it
were
hatred
theramenes
may
i
then
learn
the
meaning
of
your
flight
is
this
the
proud
hippolytus
i
see
than
whom
there
breathed
no
fiercer
foe
to
love
and
to
that
yoke
which
theseus
has
so
oft
endured
and
can
it
be
that
venus
so
long
will
justify
your
sire
at
last
has
she
then
setting
you
with
other
mortals
forced
hippolytus
to
offer
incense
before
her
can
you
love
hippolytus
friend
ask
me
not
you
who
have
known
my
heart
from
infancy
and
all
its
feelings
of
disdainful
pride
spare
me
the
shame
of
disavowing
all
that
i
profess
born
of
an
amazon
the
wildness
that
you
wonder
at
i
with
mother
milk
when
come
to
riper
age
reason
approved
what
nature
had
implanted
sincerely
bound
to
me
by
zealous
service
you
told
me
then
the
story
of
my
sire
and
know
how
oft
attentive
to
your
voice
i
kindled
when
i
heard
his
noble
acts
as
you
described
him
bringing
consolation
to
mortals
for
the
absence
of
alcides
the
highways
clear
of
monsters
and
of
robbers
procrustes
cercyon
sciro
sinnis
slain
the
epidaurian
giant
bones
dispersed
crete
reeking
with
the
blood
of
minotaur
but
when
you
told
me
of
less
glorious
deeds
troth
plighted
here
and
there
and
everywhere
young
helen
stolen
from
her
home
at
sparta
and
periboea
tears
in
salamis
with
many
another
trusting
heart
deceived
whose
very
names
have
his
memory
forsaken
ariadne
to
the
rocks
complaining
last
this
phaedra
bound
to
him
by
better
ties
you
know
with
what
regret
i
heard
and
urged
you
to
cut
short
the
tale
happy
had
i
been
able
to
erase
from
my
remembrance
that
unworthy
part
of
such
a
splendid
record
i
in
turn
am
i
too
made
the
slave
of
love
and
brought
to
stoop
so
low
the
more
contemptible
that
no
renown
is
mine
such
as
exalts
the
name
of
theseus
that
no
monsters
have
given
me
a
right
to
share
his
weakness
and
if
my
pride
of
heart
must
needs
be
humbled
aricia
should
have
been
the
last
to
tame
it
was
i
beside
myself
to
have
forgotten
eternal
barriers
of
separation
between
us
by
my
father
stern
command
her
brethren
blood
must
be
reinforced
by
sons
of
hers
he
dreads
a
single
shoot
from
stock
so
guilty
and
would
fain
with
her
bury
their
name
that
even
to
the
tomb
content
to
be
his
ward
for
her
no
torch
of
hymen
may
be
lit
shall
i
espouse
her
rights
against
my
sire
rashly
provoke
his
wrath
and
launch
upon
a
mad
career
theramenes
the
gods
dear
prince
if
once
your
hour
is
come
care
little
for
the
reasons
that
should
guide
us
wishing
to
shut
your
eyes
theseus
unseals
them
his
hatred
stirring
a
rebellious
flame
within
you
lends
his
enemy
new
charms
and
after
all
why
should
a
guiltless
passion
alarm
you
dare
you
not
essay
its
sweetness
but
follow
rather
a
fastidious
scruple
fear
you
to
stray
where
hercules
has
wander
what
heart
so
stout
that
venus
has
not
vanquish
where
would
you
be
yourself
so
long
her
foe
had
your
own
mother
constant
in
her
scorn
of
love
glowed
with
tenderness
for
theseus
what
boots
it
to
affect
a
pride
you
feel
not
confess
it
all
is
changed
for
some
time
past
you
have
been
seldom
seen
with
wild
delight
urging
the
rapid
car
along
the
strand
or
skilful
in
the
art
that
neptune
taught
making

unbroken
steed

the
woods

shouts

secret
burden

theseus
by
the
marriage
yoke
and
happiness
and
peace
seem
well
secured
when
athens
show
me
my
proud
enemy
i
look
alternately
turn
pale
and
to
see
him
and
my
soul
grew
all
distraught
a
mist
obscured
my
vision
and
my
voice
falter
my
blood
ran
cold
then
burn
like
fire
venus
i
felt
in
all
my
fever
frame
whose
fury
had
so
many
of
my
race
pursued
with
fervent
vows
i
sought
to
shun
her
torments
built
and
deck
for
her
a
shrine
and
there
countless
victims
did
i
seek
the
reason
i
had
lost
but
all
for
naught
no
remedy
could
cure
the
wounds
of
love
in
vain
i
offer
incense
on
her
altars
when
i
invoked
her
name
my
heart
adored
hippolytus
before
me
constantly
and
when
i
made
her
altars
smoke
with
victims
was
for
a
god
whose
name
i
dared
not
utter
i
fled
his
presence
everywhere
but
found
him
o
crowning
horror
in
his
father
features
against
myself
at
last
i
raised
revolt
and
stirr
my
courage
up
to
persecute
the
enemy
i
loved
to
banish
him
i
wore
a
step
dame
harsh
and
jealous
carriage
with
ceaseless
cries
i
clamour
for
his
exile
till
i
had
torn
him
from
his
father
arms
i
breathed
once
more
oenone
in
his
absence
my
days
flow
on
less
troubled
than
before
and
innocent
submissive
to
my
husband
i
hid
my
grief
and
of
our
fatal
marriage
cherish
the
fruits
vain
caution
cruel
fate
brought
hither
by
my
spouse
himself
i
saw
again
the
enemy
whom
i
had
banish
and
the
old
wound
too
quickly
bled
afresh
no
longer
is
it
love
hid
in
my
heart
but
venus
in
her
might
seizing
her
prey
i
have
conceived
just
terror
for
my
crime
i
hate
my
life
and
hold
my
love
in
horror
dying
i
wish
to
keep
my
fame
unsullied
and
bury
in
the
grave
a
guilty
passion
but
i
have
been
unable
to
withstand
tears

entreaties

have
told
you

has
he
to
lean
but
you
no

yours

dry

will
hippolytus
think

make

my

ismene
yes
i
think
so
madam
aricia
ah
you
know
him
not
or
you
would
never
deem
so
hard
a
heart
can
pity
feel
or
me
alone
except
from
the
contempt
in
which
he
holds
our
sex
has
he
not
long
avoided
every
spot
where
we
resort
ismene
i
know
what
tales
are
told
of
proud
hippolytus
but
i
have
seen
him
near
you
and
have
watch
with
curious
eye
how
one
esteem
so
cold
would
bear
himself
little
did
his
behavior
correspond
with
what
i
look
for
in
his
face
confusion
appear
at
your
first
glance
he
could
not
turn
his
languid
eyes
away
but
gazed
on
you
love
is
a
word
that
may
offend
his
pride
but
what
the
tongue
disowns
looks
can
betray
aricia
how
eagerly
my
heart
hears
what
you
say
tho
it
may
be
delusion
dear
ismene
did
it
seem
possible
to
you
who
know
me
that
i
sad
sport
of
a
relentless
fate
fed
upon
bitter
tears
by
night
and
day
could
ever
taste
the
maddening
draught
of
love
the
last
frail
offspring
of
a
royal
race
children
of
earth
i
only
have
survived
war
fury
cut
off
in
the
of
youth
mown
by
the
sword
six
brothers
have
i
lost
the
hope
of
an
illustrious
house
whose
blood
earth
drank
with
sorrow
near
akin
to
his
whom
she
herself
produced
since
then
you
know
how
thro
all
greece
no
heart
has
been
to
sigh
for
me
lest
by
a
sister
flame
the
brothers
ashes
be
perchance
rekindled
you
know
besides
with
what
disdain
i
my
conqueror
suspicions
and
precautions
and
how
oppos
as
i
have
ever
been
to
love
i
often
thank
the
king
injustice
which
happily
confirm
my
inclination
but
then
i
never
had
beheld
his
son
not
that
attracted
merely
by
the
eye
i
love
him
for
his
beauty
and
his
grace
endowments
which
he
owes
to
nature
bounty
charms
which
he
seems
to
know
not
or
to
scorn
i
love
and
prize
in
him
riches
more
rare
the
virtues
of
his
sire
without
his
faults
i
love
as
i
must
own
that
generous
pride
which
has
stoop
beneath
the
amorous
yoke
phaedra
reaps
little
glory
from
a
lover
so
lavish
of
his
sighs
i
am
too
proud
to
share
devotion
with
a
thousand
others
or
enter
where
the
door
is
always
open
but
to
make
one
who
has
stoop
before
bend
his
proud
neck
to
pierce
a
heart
of
stone
to
bind
a
captive
whom
his
chains
astonish
who
vainly
a
pleasing
yoke
rebels
that
piques
my
ardour
and
i
long
for
that
was
easier
to
disarm
the
god
of
strength
than
this
hippolytus
for
hercules
yielded
so
often
to
the
eyes
of
beauty
as
to
make
triumph
cheap
but
dear
ismene
i
take
too
little
heed
of
opposition
beyond
my
to
quell
and
you
may
hear
me
humbled
by
sore
defeat
upbraid
the
pride
i
now
admire
what
can
he
love
and
i
have
had
the
happiness
to
bend

so
long
the

that

visit
on
him
ere
long
the
hatred
by
me
his
mother
hippolytus
no
such
base
resentment
madam
is
mine
phaedra
i
could
not
blame
you
prince
if
you
should
hate
me
i
have
injured
you
so
much
you
know
but
could
not
read
my
heart
t
incur
your
enmity
has
been
mine
aim
the
borders
could
not
hold
us
both
in
public
and
in
private
i
declared
myself
your
foe
and
found
no
peace
till
seas
parted
us
from
each
other
i
forbade
your
very
name
to
be
pronounced
before
me
and
yet
if
punishment
should
be
to
the
offence
if
only
hatred
draws
your
hatred
never
woman
merited
more
pity
less
deserved
your
enmity
hippolytus
a
mother
jealous
of
her
children
rights
seldom
forgives
the
offspring
of
a
wife
who
reign
before
her
harassing
suspicions
are
common
sequels
of
a
second
marriage
of
me
would
any
other
have
been
jealous
no
less
than
you
perhaps
more
violent
phaedra
ah
prince
how
has
from
the
general
law
made
me
exempt
be
that
same
my
witness
far
different
is
the
trouble
that
devours
me
hippolytus
this
is
no
time
for
madam
it
may
be
that
your
husband
still
beholds
the
light
and
may
grant
him
safe
return
in
answer
to
our
prayers
his
guardian
god
is
neptune
by
him
invoked
in
vain
phaedra
he
who
has
seen
the
mansions
of
the
dead
returns
not
thence
since
to
those
gloomy
shores
theseus
is
gone
is
vain
to
hope
that
may
send
him
back
prince
there
is
no
release
from
acheron
greedy
maw
and
yet
methinks
he
lives
and
breathes
in
you
i
see
him
still
before
me
and
to
him
i
seem
to
speak
my
heart
oh
i
am
mad
do
what
i
will
i
can
not
hide
my
passion
hippolytus
yes
i
see
the
strange
effects
of
love
theseus
tho
dead
seems
present
to
your
eyes
for
in
your
soul
there
burns
a
constant
flame
phaedra
ah
yes
for
theseus
i
languish
and
i
long
not
as
the
shades
have
seen
him
of
a
thousand
different
forms
the
fickle
lover
and
of
pluto
bride
the
ravisher
but
faithful
proud
to
a
slight
disdain
with
youthful
charms
attracting
every
heart
as
gods
are
painted
or
like
yourself
he
had
your
mien
your
eyes
spoke
and
could
blush
like
you
when
to
the
isle
of
crete
my
childhood
home
he
cross
the
waves
worthy
to
win
the
love
of
minos
daughters
what
were
you
doing
then
why
did
he
gather
the
of
greece
and
leave
hippolytus
oh
why
were
you
too
young
to
have
on
board
the
ship
that
brought
thy
sire
to
crete
at
your
hands
would
the
monster
then
have
perish
despite
the
windings
of
his
vast
retreat
to
guide
your
doubtful
steps
within
the
maze
my
sister
would
have
arm
you
with
the
clue
but
no
therein
would
phaedra
have
forestall
her
love
would
have
first
inspired
me
with
the
thought
and
i
it
would
have
been
whose
timely
aid
had
taught
you
all
the
labyrinth
crooked
ways
what
anxious
care
a
life
so
dear
had
cost
me
no
thread
had
satisfied
your
lover
fears
i
would
myself
have
wish
to
lead
the
way
and
share
the
peril
you
were
bound
to
face
phaedra
with
you
would
have
explored
the
maze
with
you
emerged
in
safety
or
have
perish
hippolytus
gods
what
is
this
i
hear
have
you
forgotten
that
theseus
is
my
father
and
your
husband
phaedra
why
should
you
fancy
i
have
lost
remembrance
thereof
and
am
regardless
of
mine
honour
hippolytus
forgive
me
madam
with
a
blush
i
own
that
i
misconstrued
words
of
innocence
for
very
shame
i
can
not
bear
your
sight
longer
i
go
phaedra
ah
cruel
prince
too
well
you
understood
me
i
have
said
enough
to
save
you
from
mistake
i
love
but
think
not
that
at
the
moment
when
i
love
you
most
i
do
not
feel
my
guilt
no
weak
compliance
has
fed
the
poison
that
infects
my
brain
the
object
of
celestial
vengeance
i
am
not
so
detestable
to
you
as
to
myself
the
gods
will
bear
me
witness
who
have
within
my
veins
kindled
this
fire
the
gods
who
take
a
barbarous
delight
in
leading
a
poor
mortal
heart
astray
do
you
yourself
recall
to
mind
the
past
was
not
enough
for
me
to
fly
i
chased
you
out
of
the
country
wishing
to
appear
inhuman
odious
to
resist
you
better
i
sought
to
make
you
hate
me
all
in
vain
hating
me
more
i
loved
you
none
the
less
new
charms
were
lent
to
you
by
your
misfortunes
i
have
been
drown
in
tears
and
scorch
by
fire
your
own
eyes
might
convince
you
of
the
truth
if
for
one
moment
you
could
look
at
me
what
i
say
think
you
this
vile
confession
that
i
have
made
is
what
i
meant
to
utter
not
daring
to
betray
a
son
for
whom
i
trembled
was
to
beg
you
not
to
hate
him
i
came
weak
purpose
of
a
heart
too
full
of
love
for
you
to
speak
of
aught
besides
take
your
revenge
punish
my

prove
yourself
worthy

disgrace
you
to
steep
your

in
such
polluted
blood
if

me
how
reluctant
to
catch
my

dull

cold
as

and
eager
only
for
a

retreat
how
oft
his

made
my

why

you
turn
me
from

did
he
grow
pale

brooding
on

fan

stifled
would
it

the

flock
to

i
went
by

find
the

when
with
a
thousand
shouts
the

was
rent
phaedra
my
husband
is
alive
that
is

oenone
i
have
a

that
dishonours
him
he
lives
i
ask
to
know
no
more

what
phaedra
i
foretold
it
but
you
refused
to
hear
your
tears
over
my
just
remorse
dying
this
morn
i
had
deserved
compassion
your
advice
i
took
and
die

just
what
have
i
done
my

comes
with
him
his
son
and
i
shall
see
the
witness
of
my
adulterous
flame
watch
with
what
face
i
greet
his
father
while
my
heart
is
big
with
sighs
he
scorn
and
tears
that
could
not
move
him
moisten
mine
eyes
think
you
that
his
respect
for
theseus
will
induce
him
to
conceal
my
madness
nor
disgrace
his
sire
and
king
will
he
be
able
to
keep
back
the
horror
he
has
for
me
his
silence
would
be
vain
i
know
my
treason
and
i
lack
the
boldness
of
those
abandon
women
who
can
taste
tranquillity
in
crime
and
show
a
forehead
all
unabash
i
recognize
my
madness
recall
it
all
these
vaulted
roofs
methinks
these
walls
can
speak
and
ready
to
accuse
me
wait
but
my
husband
presence
to
reveal
my
perfidy
death
only
can
remove
this
weight
of
horror
is
it
such
misfortune
to
cease
to
live
death
causes
no
alarm
to
misery
i
only
fear
the

that
i
shall
leave
behind
me
for
my
sons
how
sad
a
heritage
the
blood
of
jove
might
justly
swell
the
pride
that
boasts
descent
from

heavy
weighs
a
mother
guilt
upon
her
offspring
yes
i
dread
the
scorn
that
will
be
cast
on
them
with
too
much
truth
for
my
disgrace
i
tremble
when
i
think
that
crush
beneath
that
curse
they
never
dare
to
raise
their
eyes
oenone
doubt
not
i
pity
both
never
was
fear
more
just
than
yours
why
then
expose
them
to
this
ignominy
why
will
you
accuse
yourself
you
thus
destroy
the
only
hope
that
left
it
will
be
said
that
phaedra
conscious
of
her
perfidy
fled
from
her

sight
hippolytus
will
be
rejoiced
that
dying
you
should
lend
his

support
what
can
i
answer
him
he
find
it
easy
to
confute
my
tale
and
i
shall
hear
him
with
an
air
of
triumph
to
every
open
ear
repeat
your
shame
sooner
than
that
may
fire
from
consume
me
deceive
me
not

do
you
love
him
still
how
look
you
now
on
this
contemptuous
prince
phaedra
as
on
a
monster
frightful
to
mine
eyes
oenone
why
yield
him
then
an
easy
victory
you
fear
him
venture
to
accuse
him
first
as
guilty
of
the
charge
which
he
may
bring
this
day
against
you
who
can
say
is
false
all
tells
against
him
in

happily
left
behind
your

your

it
more
willingly
i
face
a

but
since
without

bitter
remedy
i
lose
you

absence
spared
your

i
am
unfit

your
fond
caress

only
care
henceforth
scene
v
theseus
hippolytus
theramenes
theseus
strange
welcome
for
your
father
this
what
does
it
mean
my
son
hippolytus
phaedra
alone
can
solve
this
mystery
but
if
my
wish
can
move
you
let
me
never
see
her
more
suffer
hippolytus
to
disappear
for
ever
from
the
home
that
holds
your
wife
theseus
you
my
son
leave
me
hippolytus
was
not
i
who
sought
her
was
you
who
led
her
footsteps
to
these
shores
at
your
departure
you
thought
meet
my
lord
to
trust
aricia
and
the
queen
to
this
troezenian
land
and
i
myself
was
charged
with
their
protection
but
what
cares
henceforth
need
keep
me
here
my
youth
of
idleness
has
shown
its
skill
enough
paltry
foes
that
range
the
woods
may
i
not
quit
a
life
of
such
inglorious
ease
and
dip
my
spear
in
nobler
blood
ere
you
had
reach
my
age
more
than
one
tyrant
monster
more
than
one
had
felt
the
weight
of
your
stout
arm
already
successful
in
attacking
insolence
you
had
removed
all
dangers
that
infested
our
coasts
to
east
and
west
the
traveller
outrage
no
longer
hearing
of
your
deeds
already
hercules
relied
on
you
and
rested
from
his
toils
while
i
unknown
son
of
so
brave
a
sire
am
far
behind
even
my
mother
footsteps
let
my
courage
have
scope
to
act
and
if
some
monster
yet
has
you
let
me
lay
the
glorious
spoils
down
at
your
feet
or
let
the
memory
of
death
faced
nobly
keep
my
name
alive
and
prove
to
all
the
world
i
was
your
son
theseus
why
what
is
this
what
terror
has
my
family
to
make
them
fly
before
me
if
i
return
to
find
myself
so
fear
so
little
welcome
why
did
release
me
from
prison
my
sole
friend
misled
by
passion
was
bent
on
robbing
of
his
wife
the
tyrant
who
ruled
epirus
with
regret
i
lent
the
lover
aid
but
fate
had
made
us
blind
myself
as
well
as
him
the
tyrant
seized
me
defenceless
and
unarm
pirithous
i
saw
with
tears
cast
forth
to
be
by
savage
beasts
that
lapp
the
blood
of
men
myself
in
gloomy
caverns
he
inclosed
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
nigh
to
pluto
realms
six
months
i
lay
ere
had
pity
and
i
the
watchful
eyes
that
guarded
me
then
did
i
purge
the
world
of
a
foul
foe
and
he
himself
has
fed
his
monsters
but
when
with
expectant
joy
to
all
that
is
most
precious
i
draw
near
of
what
the
gods
have
left
me
when
my
soul
looks
for
full
satisfaction
in
a
sight
so
dear
my
only
welcome
is
a
shudder
embrace
rejected
and
a
hasty
flight
inspiring
as
i
clearly
do
such
terror
would
i
were
still
a
prisoner
in
epirus
phaedra
complains
that
i
have
suffer

not

own
dear
son
confederate
with
mine
enemies
i
enter
this
suspense
is
overwhelming
i
learn
at
once
the
culprit
and
the
crime
and
phaedra
must
explain
her
troubled
state
scene
vi
hippolytus
theramenes
hippolytus
what
do
these
words
portend
which
seem
to
freeze
my
very
blood
will
phaedra
in
her
frenzy
accuse
herself
and
seal
her
own
destruction
what
will
the
king
say
gods
what
fatal
poison
has
love
spread
over
all
his
house
myself
full
of
a
fire
his
hatred
disapproves
how
changed
he
finds
me
from
the
son
he
knew
with
dark
forebodings
in
my
mind
alarm
but
innocence
has
surely
naught
to
fear
come
let
us
go
and
in
some
other
place
consider
how
i
best
may
move
my
sire
to
tenderness
and
tell
him
of
a
flame

but
not
vanquish
by
a
father

act
iv

i
theseus
oenone
theseus
ah
what
is
this
i
hear
presumptuous
traitor
and
would
he
have
disgraced
his
father
honour
with
what
relentless
footsteps
fate
pursues
me
whither
i
go
i
know
not
nor
where

object
of
his
foul
desire
the
wretch
disdain
not

use
violence
i
know
this
sword
that
served
him
in
his
fury
the
sword
i
gave
him
for
a
nobler
use
could
not
the
sacred
ties
of
blood
restrain
him
and
phaedra
was
she
loath
to
have
him
punish
she
held
her
tongue
was
that
to
spare
the
culprit
oenone
nay
but
to
spare
a
most
unhappy
father
with
shame
that
her
eyes
should
have
kindled
so
infamous
a
flame
and
prompted
him
to
crime
so
heinous
phaedra
would
have
died
i
saw
her
raise
her
arm
and
ran
to
save
her
to
me
alone
you
owe
it
that
she
lives
and
in
my
pity
both
for
her
and
you
have
i
against
my
will
interpreted
her
tears
theseus
the
traitor
he
might
well
turn
pale
was
fear
that
made
him
tremble
when
he
saw
me
i
was
astonish
that
he
show
no
pleasure
his
frigid
greeting
chill
my
tenderness
but
was
this
guilty
passion
that
devours
him
declared
already
ere
i
banish
him
from
athens
oenone
sire
remember
how
the
queen
urged
you
illicit
love
caused
all
her
hatred

and
then
this
fire
broke
out
again
at

her
scene

there
he
is
great

that

why
should
the
sacred
stamp
of

gleam
upon
the
forehead
of
an
impious
wretch
ought
not
the
blackness
of
a
traitor
heart
to
show
itself
by
sure
and
certain
signs
hippolytus
my
father
may
i
ask
what
fatal
cloud
has
troubled
your
majestic
countenance
dare
you
not
trust
this
secret
to
your

theseus
traitor
how
dare
you
show
yourself
before
me
monster
whom
heaven
bolts
have
spared
too
long
survivor
of
that
robber
crew
whereof
i
cleansed
the
earth
after
your
brutal
lust

even
to

you
venture
you
my
hated
foe
to
come
into
my
presence
here
where
all
is
full
of
your
foul
infamy
instead
of
seeking

fly
traitor
fly
stay
not
to
tempt
the
wrath
that
i
can
scarce
restrain

in
being
father
of
so
vile
a

staining
indelibly

horror
all
my

confounds
such
unexpected
blows
falling
at

choke
my
utterance
strike
me
dumb
theseus
traitor
you
reckon
that
in
timid
silence
phaedra
would
bury
your
brutality
you
should
not
have
abandon
in
your
flight
the
sword
that
in
her
hands
helps
to
condemn
you
or
rather
to
complete
your
perfidy
you
should
have
robb

hippolytus
justly
indignant
at
a
lie
so
black

dead

sudden
stroke
theramenes
scarce

out
of
the

of

silent
in
his
chariot
and
his
guards
downcast
and
silent
too
around
him
ranged
to
the
mycenian
road
he
turn
his
steeds
then
lost
in
thought
allow
the
reins
to
lie
loose
on
their
backs
his
noble
chargers
erst
so
full
of
ardour
to
obey
his
voice
with
head
depress
and
melancholy
eye
seem
now
to
mark
his
sadness
and
to
share
it
a
frightful
cry
that
issues
from
the
deep
with
sudden
discord
rends
the
troubled
air
and
from
the
bosom
of
the
earth
a
groan
is
heard
in
answer
to
that
voice
of
terror
our
blood
is
frozen
at
our
very
hearts
with
bristling
manes
the
steeds
stand
still
meanwhile
upon
the
watery
plain
there
rises
a
mountain
billow
with
a
mighty
crest
of
foam
that
shoreward
rolls
and
as
it
breaks
before
our
eyes
vomits
a
furious
monster
with
formidable
horns
its
brow
is
arm
and
all
its
body
clothed
with
yellow
scales
in
front
a
savage
bull
behind
a
dragon
turning
and
twisting
in
impatient
rage
its
long
continued
bellowings
make
the
shore
tremble
the
sky
seems
to
see
it
the
earth
with
terror
quakes
its
poisonous
breath
infects
the
air
the
wave
that
brought
it
ebbs
in
fear
all
fly
forgetful
of
the
courage
that
can
not
aid
and
in
a
neighbouring
temple
take
refuge
all
save
bold
hippolytus
a
hero
worthy
son
he
stays
his
steeds
seizes
his
darts
and
rushing
forward
hurls
a
missile
with
sure
aim
that
wounds
the
monster
deep
in
the
flank
with
rage
and
pain
it
springs
to
the
horses
feet
and
roaring
falls
writhes
in
the
dust
and
shows
a
fiery
throat
that
covers
them
with
flames
and
blood
and
smoke
fear
lends
them
wings
deaf
to
his
voice
for
once
and
heedless
of
the
curb
they
onward
fly
their
master
wastes
his
strength
in
efforts
vain
with
foam
and
blood
each
courser
bit
is
red
some
say
a
god
amid
this
wild
disorder
was
seen
with
goads
pricking
their
dusty
flanks
jagged
rocks
they
rush
urged
on
by
terror

goes
the
th
intrepid
youth
sees
his
car
broken
up
flying
to
pieces
he
falls
himself
entangled
in
the
reins
pardon
my
grief
that
cruel
spectacle
will
be
for
me
a
source
of
endless
tears
i
saw
thy
hapless
son
i
saw
him
sire
drag
by
the
horses
that
his
hands
had
fed
to
check
their
fierce
career
his
voice
but
adding
to
their
fright
his
body
soon
one
mass
of
wounds
our
cries
of
anguish
fill
the
plain
at
last
they
slacken
their
swift
pace
then
stop
not
far
from
those
old
tombs
that
mark
where
lie
the
ashes
of
his
royal
sires
panting
i
thither
run
and
after
me
his
guard
along
the
track
stain
with
fresh
blood
that
reddens
all
the
rocks
caught
in
the
briers
locks
of
his
hair

dripping
gory
spoils

call
him
stretching
forth
his
hand
he
opens
his
dying
eyes
soon
closed

sad
sight
for
lover

hippolytus
stretch
there
pale
and
disfigured
but
for
a
time
doubtful
of
her
misfortune
unrecognized
the
hero
she
adores
she
looks
and
asks
where
is
hippolytus
only
too
sure
at
last
that
he
lies
there
before
her
with
sad
eyes
that
silently
reproach
the
gods
she
shudders
groans
and
falls
swooning
and
all
but
lifeless
at
his
feet
ismene
all
in
tears

down
beside
her
and
calls
her
back
to
life

naught

sense
of
pain

death
affords
me
cause
enough
for

only
serve
