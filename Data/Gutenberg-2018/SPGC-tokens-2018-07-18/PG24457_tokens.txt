preface
this
book
forming
part
vi
of
the
series
called
france
and
england
in
north
america
fills
the
gap
between
part
count
frontenac
and
part
montcalm
and
wolfe
so
that
the
series
now
forms
a
continuous
history
of
the
efforts
of
france
to
occupy
and
control
this
continent
in
the
present
volumes
the
nature
of
the
subject
does
not
permit
an
unbroken
thread
of
narrative
and
the
unity
of
the
book
lies
in
its
being
throughout
in
one
form
or
another
an
illustration
of
the
singularly
contrasted
characters
and
methods
of
the
rival
claimants
to
north
america
like
the
rest
of
the
series
this
work
is
founded
on
original
documents
the
statements
of
secondary
writers
have
been
accepted
only
when
found
to
conform
to
the
evidence
of
contemporaries
whose
writings
have
been
sifted
and
collated
with
the
greatest
care
as
extremists
on
each
side
have
charged
me
with
favoring
the
other
i
hope
i
have
been
unfair
to
neither
the
manuscript
material
collected
for
the
preparation
of
the
series
now
complete
forms
about
seventy
volumes
most
of
them
folios
these
have
been
given
by
me
from
time
to
time
to
the
massachusetts
historical
society
in
whose
library
they
now
are
open
to
the
examination
of
those
interested
in
the
subjects
of
which
they
treat
the
collection
was
begun
years
ago
and
its
formation
has
been
exceedingly
slow
having
been
retarded
by
difficulties
which
seemed
insurmountable
and
for
years
were
so
in
fact
hence
the
completion
of
the
series
has
required
twice
the
time
that
would
have
sufficed
under
less
unfavorable
conditions

for

and

and

the
war
which
in
the
british
colonies
was
called
queen
anne
war
and
in
england
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
was
the
second
of
a
series
of
four
conflicts
which
ended
in
giving
to
great
britain
a
maritime
and
colonial
preponderance
over
france
and
spain
so
far
as
concerns
the
colonies
and
the
sea
these
several
wars
may
be
regarded
as
a
single
protracted
one
broken
by
intervals
of
truce
the
three
earlier
of
them
it
is
true
were
european
contests
begun
and
waged
on
european
disputes
their
american
part
was
incidental
and
apparently
subordinate
yet
it
involved
questions
of
prime
importance
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
sprang
from
the
ambition
of
louis
xiv
we
are
apt
to
regard
the
story
of
that
gorgeous
monarch
as
a
tale
that
is
told
but
his
influence
shapes
the
life
of
nations
to
this
day
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
two
roads
lay
before
him
and
it
was
a
momentous
question
for
posterity
as
for
his
own
age
which
one
of
them
he
would
choose
whether
he
would
follow
the
wholesome
policy
of
his
great
minister
colbert
or
obey
his
own
vanity
and
arrogance
and
plunge
france
into
exhausting
wars
whether
he
would
hold
to
the
principle
of
tolerance
embodied
in
the
edict
of
nantes
or
do
the
work
of
fanaticism
and
priestly
ambition
the
one
course
meant
prosperity
progress
and
the
rise
of
a
middle
class
the
other
meant
bankruptcy
and
the
dragonades
and
this
was
the
king
choice
crushing
taxation
misery
and
ruin
followed
till
france
burst
out
at
last
in
a
frenzy
drunk
with
the
wild
dreams
of
rousseau
then
came
the
terror
and
the
napoleonic
wars
and
reaction
on
reaction
revolution
on
revolution
down
to
our
own
day
louis
placed
his
grandson
on
the
throne
of
spain
and
insulted
england
by
acknowledging
as
her
rightful
king
the
son
of
james
whom
she
had
deposed
then
england
declared
war
canada
and
the
northern
british
colonies
had
had
but
a
short
breathing
time
since
the
peace
of
ryswick
both
were
tired
of
slaughtering
each
other
and
both
needed
rest
yet
before
the
declaration
of
war
the
canadian
officers
of
the
crown
prepared
with
their
usual
energy
to
meet
the
expected
crisis
one
of
them
wrote
if
war
be
declared
it
is
certain
that
the
king
can
very
easily
conquer
and
ruin
new
england
the
french
of
canada
often
use
the
name
new
england
as
applying
to
the
british
colonies
in
general
they
are
twice
as
populous
as
canada
he
goes
on
to
say
but
the
people
are
great
cowards
totally
undisciplined
and
ignorant
of
war
while
the
canadians
are
brave
hardy
and
well
trained
we
have
besides
companies
of
regulars
and
could
raise
six
thousand
warriors
from
our
indian
allies
four
thousand
men
could
easily
lay
waste
all
the
northern
english
colonies
to
which
end
we
must
have
five
ships
of
war
with
one
thousand
troops
on
board
who
must
land
at
penobscot
where
they
must
be
joined
by
two
thousand
regulars
militia
and
indians
sent
from
canada
by
way
of
the
chaudière
and
the
kennebec
then
the
whole
force
must
go
to
portsmouth
take
it
by
assault
leave
a
garrison
there
and
march
to
boston
laying
waste
all
the
towns
and
villages
by
the
way
after
destroying
boston
the
army
must
march
for
new
york
while
the
fleet
follows
along
the
coast
nothing
could
be
easier
says
the
writer
for
the
road
is
good
and
there
is
plenty
of
horses
and
carriages
the
troops
would
ruin
everything
as
they
advanced
and
new
york
would
quickly
be
destroyed
and
burned
another
plan
scarcely
less
absurd
was
proposed
about
the
same
time
by
the
celebrated
le
moyne
the
essential
point
he
says
is
to
get
possession
of
boston
but
there
are
difficulties
and
risks
in
the
way
nothing
he
adds
referring
to
the
other
plan
seems
difficult
to
persons
without
experience
but
unless
we
are
prepared
to
raise
a
great
and
costly
armament
our
only
hope
is
in
surprise
we
should
make
it
in
winter
when
the
seafaring
population
which
is
the
chief
strength
of
the
place
is
absent
on
long
voyages
a
thousand
canadians
four
hundred
regulars
and
as
many
indians
should
leave
quebec
in
november
ascend
the
chaudière
then
descend
the
kennebec
approach
boston
under
cover
of
the
forest
and
carry
it
by
a
night
attack
apparently
he
did
not
know
that
but
for
its
lean
neck
then
but
a
few
yards
wide
boston
was
an
island
and
that
all
around
for
many
leagues
the
forest
that
was
to
have
covered
his
approach
had
already
been
devoured
by
numerous
busy
settlements
he
offers
to
lead
the
expedition
and
declares
that
if
he
is
honored
with
the
command
he
will
warrant
that
the
new
england
capital
will
be
forced
to
submit
to
king
louis
after
which
new
york
can
be
seized
in
its
turn
in
contrast
to
those
incisive
proposals
another
french
officer
breathed
nothing
but
peace
brouillan
governor
of
acadia
wrote
to
the
governor
of
massachusetts
to
suggest
that
with
the
consent
of
their
masters
they
should
make
a
treaty
of
neutrality
the
english
governor
being
dead
the
letter
came
before
the
council
who
received
it
coldly
canada
and
not
acadia
was
the
enemy
they
had
to
fear
moreover
boston
merchants
made
good
profit
by
supplying
the
acadians
with
necessaries
which
they
could
get
in
no
other
way
and
in
time
of
war
these
profits
though
lawless
were
greater
than
in
time
of
peace
but
what
chiefly
influenced
the
council
against
the
overtures
of
brouillan
was
a
passage
in
his
letter
reminding
them
that
by
the
treaty
of
ryswick
the
new
england
people
had
no
right
to
fish
within
sight
of
the
acadian
coast
this
they
flatly
denied
saying
that
the
new
england
people
had
fished
there
time
out
of
mind
and
that
if
brouillan
should
molest
them
they
would
treat
it
as
an
act
of
war
while
the
new
england
colonies
and
especially
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
had
most
cause
to
deprecate
a
war
the
prospect
of
one
was
also
extremely
unwelcome
to
the
people
of
new
york
the
conflict
lately
closed
had
borne
hard
upon
them
through
the
attacks
of
the
enemy
and
still
more
through
the
derangement
of
their
industries
they
were
distracted
too
with
the
factions
rising
out
of
the
recent
revolution
under
jacob
leisler
new
york
had
been
the
bulwark
of
the
colonies
farther
south
who
feeling
themselves
safe
had
given
their
protector
little
help
and
that
little
grudgingly
seeming
to
regard
the
war
as
no
concern
of
theirs
three
thousand
and
pounds
provincial
currency
was
the
joint
contribution
of
virginia
maryland
east
jersey
and
connecticut
to
the
aid
of
new
york
during
five
years
of
the
late
war
massachusetts
could
give
nothing
even
if
she
would
her
hands
being
full
with
the
defence
of
her
own
borders
colonel
quary
wrote
to
the
board
of
trade
that
new
york
could
not
bear
alone
the
cost
of
defending
herself
that
the
other
colonies
were
stuffed
with
commonwealth
notions
and
were
of
a
sour
temper
in
opposition
to
government
so
that
parliament
ought
to
take
them
in
hand
and
compel
each
to
do
its
part
in
the
common
cause
to
this
lord
cornbury
adds
that
rhode
island
and
connecticut
are
even
more
stubborn
than
the
rest
hate
all
true
subjects
of
the
queen
and
will
not
give
a
farthing
to
the
war
so
long
as
they
can
help
it
each
province
lived
in
selfish
isolation
recking
little
of
its
neighbor
woes
new
york
left
to
fight
her
own
battles
was
in
a
wretched
condition
for
defence
it
is
true
that
unlike
the
other
colonies
the
king
had
sent
her
a
few
soldiers
counting
at
this
time
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
all
told
but
they
had
been
left
so
long
without
pay
that
they
were
in
a
state
of
scandalous
destitution
they
would
have
been
left
without
rations
had
not
three
private
gentlemen
schuyler
livingston
and
cortlandt
advanced
money
for
their
supplies
which
seems
never
to
have
been
repaid
they
are
reported
to
have
been
without
shirts
breeches
shoes
or
stockings
and
in
such
a
shameful
condition
that
the
women
when
passing
them
are
obliged
to
cover
their
eyes
the
indians
ask
says
the
governor
you
think
us
such
fools
as
to
believe
that
a
king
who
can
not
clothe
his
soldiers
can
protect
us
from
the
french
with
their
fourteen
hundred
men
all
well
equipped
the
forts
were
no
better
than
their
garrisons
the
governor
complains
that
those
of
albany
and
schenectady
are
so
weak
and
ridiculous
that
they
look
more
like
pounds
for
cattle
than
forts
at
albany
the
rotten
stockades
were
falling
from
their
own
weight
if
new
york
had
cause
to
complain
of
those
whom
she
sheltered
she
herself
gave
cause
of
complaint
to
those
who
sheltered
her
the
five
nations
of
the
iroquois
had
always
been
her
allies
against
the
french
had
guarded
her
borders
and
fought
her
battles
what
they
wanted
in
return
were
gifts
attentions
just
dealings
and
active
aid
in
war
but
they
got
them
in
scant
measure
their
treatment
by
the
province
was
if
not
ungrateful
new
york
was
a
mixture
of
races
and
religions
not
yet
fused
into
a
harmonious
body
politic
divided
in
interests
and
torn
with
intestine
disputes
its
assembly
was
made
up
in
large
part
of
men
unfitted
to
pursue
a
consistent
scheme
of
policy
or
spend
the
little
money
at
their
disposal
on
any
objects
but
those
of
present
and
visible
interest
the
royal
governors
even
when
personally
competent
were
hampered
by
want
of
means
and
by
factious
opposition
the
five
nations
were
robbed
by
cheated
by
traders
and
feebly
supported
in
their
constant
wars
with
the
french
spasmodically
as
it
were
on
occasions
of
crisis
they
were
summoned
to
albany
soothed
with
such
presents
as
could
be
got
from
unwilling
legislators
or
now
and
then
from
the
crown
and
exhorted
to
fight
vigorously
in
the
common
cause
the
case
would
have
been
far
worse
but
for
a
few
patriotic
men
with
peter
schuyler
at
their
head
who
understood
the
character
of
these
indians
and
labored
strenuously
to
keep
them
in
what
was
called
their
allegiance
the
proud
and
fierce
confederates
had
suffered
greatly
in
the
late
war
their
numbers
had
been
reduced
about
one
half
and
they
now
counted
little
more
than
twelve
hundred
warriors
they
had
learned
a
bitter
and
humiliating
lesson
and
their
arrogance
had
changed
to
distrust
and
alarm
though
hating
the
french
they
had
learned
to
respect
their
military
activity
and
prowess
and
to
look
askance
on
the
dutch
and
english
who
rarely
struck
a
blow
in
their
defence
and
suffered
their
hereditary
enemy
to
waste
their
fields
and
burn
their
towns
the
english
called
the
five
nations
british
subjects
on
which
the
french
taunted
them
with
being
british
slaves
and
told
them
that
the
king
of
england
had
ordered
the
governor
of
new
york
to
poison
them
this
invention
had
great
effect
the
iroquois
capital
onondaga
was
filled
with
wild
rumors
the
credulous
savages
were
tossed
among
doubts
suspicions
and
fears
some
were
in
terror
of
poison
and
some
of
witchcraft
they
believed
that
the
rival
european
nations
had
leagued
to
destroy
them
and
divide
their
lands
and
that
they
were
bewitched
by
sorcerers
both
french
and
english
after
the
peace
of
ryswick
and
even
before
it
the
french
governor
kept
agents
among
them
some
of
these
were
soldiers
like
joncaire
maricourt
or
longueuil
and
some
were
jesuits
like
bruyas
lamberville
or
vaillant
the
jesuits
showed
their
usual
ability
and
skill
in
their
difficult
and
perilous
task
the
indians
derived
various
advantages
from
their
presence
which
they
regarded
also
as
a
flattering
attention
while
the
english
jealous
of
their
influence
made
feeble
attempts
to
counteract
it
by
sending
protestant
clergymen
to
onondaga
but
writes
lord
bellomont
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
prevail
with
the
ministers
to
live
among
the
indians
they
the
indians
are
so
nasty
as
never
to
wash
their
hands
or
the
utensils
they
dress
their
victuals
with
even
had
their
zeal
been
proof
to
these
afflictions
the
ministers
would
have
been
no
match
for
their
astute
opponents
in
vain
bellomont
assured
the
indians
that
the
jesuits
were
the
greatest
lyars
and
impostors
in
the
world
in
vain
he
offered
a
hundred
dollars
for
every
one
of
them
whom
they
should
deliver
into
his
hands
they
would
promise
to
expel
them
but
their
minds
were
divided
and
they
stood
in
fear
of
one
another
while
one
party
distrusted
and
disliked
the
priests
another
was
begging
the
governor
of
canada
to
send
more
others
took
a
practical
view
of
the
question
if
the
english
sell
goods
cheaper
than
the
french
we
will
have
ministers
if
the
french
sell
them
cheaper
than
the
english
we
will
have

others
again
wanted
neither
jesuits
nor

because
both
of
you
english
and
french
have
made
us
drunk
with
the
noise
of
your
praying
the
aims
of
the
propagandists
on
both
sides
were
secular
the
french
wished
to
keep
the
five
nations
neutral
in
the
event
of
another
war
the
english
wished
to
spur
them
to
active
hostility
but
while
the
former
pursued
their
purpose
with
energy
and
skill
the
efforts
of
the
latter
were
intermittent
and
generally
feeble
the
nations
writes
schuyler
are
full
of
factions
there
was
a
french
party
and
an
english
party
in
every
town
especially
in
onondaga
the
centre
of
intrigue
french
influence
was
strongest
at
the
western
end
of
the
confederacy
among
the
senecas
where
the
french
officer
joncaire
an
iroquois
by
adoption
had
won
many
to
france
and
it
was
weakest
at
the
eastern
end
among
the
mohawks
who
were
nearest
to
the
english
settlements
here
the
jesuits
had
labored
long
and
strenuously
in
the
work
of
conversion
and
from
time
to
time
they
had
led
their
numerous
proselytes
to
remove
to
canada
where
they
settled
at
louis
or
caughnawaga
on
the
right
bank
of
the
lawrence
a
little
above
montreal
where
their
descendants
still
remain
it
is
said
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
of
the
mohawks
had
thus
been
persuaded
to
cast
their
lot
with
the
french
and
from
enemies
to
become
friends
and
allies
some
of
the
oneidas
and
a
few
of
the
other
iroquois
nations
joined
them
and
strengthened
the
new
mission
settlement
and
the
caughnawagas
afterwards
played
an
important
part
between
the
rival
european
colonies
the
far
indians
or
upper
nations
as
the
french
called
them
consisted
of
the
tribes
of
the
great
lakes
and
adjacent
regions
ottawas
pottawattamies
sacs
foxes
sioux
and
many
more
it
was
from
these
that
canada
drew
the
furs
by
which
she
lived
most
of
them
were
nominal
friends
and
allies
of
the
french
who
in
the
interest
of
trade
strove
to
keep
these
from
tearing
one
another
throats
and
who
were
in
constant
alarm
lest
they
should
again
come
to
blows
with
their
old
enemies
the
five
nations
in
which
case
they
would
call
on
canada
for
help
thus
imperilling
those
pacific
relations
with
the
iroquois
confederacy
which
the
french
were
laboring
constantly
to
secure
in
regard
to
the
far
indians
the
french
the
english
and
the
five
iroquois
nations
all
had
distinct
and
opposing
interests
the
french
wished
to
engross
their
furs
either
by
inducing
the
indians
to
bring
them
down
to
montreal
or
by
sending
traders
into
their
country
to
buy
them
the
english
with
a
similar
object
wished
to
divert
the
far
indians
from
montreal
and
draw
them
to
albany
but
this
did
not
suit
the
purpose
of
the
five
nations
who
being
sharp
politicians
and
keen
traders
as
well
as
bold
and
enterprising
warriors
wished
to
act
as
between
the
tribes
and
the
albany
merchants
well
knowing
that
good
profit
might
thus
accrue
in
this
state
of
affairs
the
converted
iroquois
settled
at
caughnawaga
played
a
peculiar
part
in
the
province
of
new
york
goods
for
the
indian
trade
were
of
excellent
quality
and
comparatively
abundant
and
cheap
while
among
the
french
especially
in
time
of
war
they
were
often
scarce
and
dear
the
caughnawagas
accordingly
whom
neither
the
english
nor
the
french
dared
offend
used
their
position
to
carry
on
a
contraband
trade
between
new
york
and
canada
by
way
of
lake
champlain
and
the
hudson
they
brought
to
albany
furs
from
the
country
of
the
far
indians
and
exchanged
them
for
guns
blankets
cloths
knives
beads
and
the
like
these
they
carried
to
canada
and
sold
to
the
french
traders
who
in
this
way
and
often
in
this
alone
supplied
themselves
with
the
goods
necessary
for
bartering
furs
from
the
far
indians
this
lawless
trade
of
the
caughnawagas
went
on
even
in
time
of
war
and
opposed
as
it
was
to
every
principle
of
canadian
policy
it
was
generally
connived
at
by
the
french
authorities
as
the
only
means
of
obtaining
the
goods
necessary
for
keeping
their
indian
allies
in
good
humor
it
was
injurious
to
english
interests
but
the
of
albany
and
also
the
commissioners
charged
with
indian
affairs
being
dutchmen
converted
by
force
into
british
subjects
were
with
a
few
eminent
exceptions
cool
in
their
devotion
to
the
british
crown
while
the
merchants
of
the
port
of
new
york
from
whom
the
drew
their
supplies
thought
more
of
their
own
profits
than
of
the
public
good
the
trade
with
canada
through
the
caughnawagas
not
only
gave
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
but
continually
admitted
spies
into
the
colony
from
whom
the
governor
of
canada
gained
information
touching
english
movements
and
designs
the
dutch
traders
of
albany
and
the
importing
merchants
who
supplied
them
with
indian
goods
had
a
strong
interest
in
preventing
active
hostilities
with
canada
which
would
have
spoiled
their
trade
so
too
and
for
similar
reasons
had
influential
persons
in
canada
the
french
authorities
moreover
thought
it
impolitic
to
harass
the
frontiers
of
new
york
by
war
parties
since
the
five
nations
might
come
to
the
aid
of
their
dutch
and
english
allies
and
so
break
the
peaceful
relations
which
the
french
were
anxious
to
maintain
with
them
thus
it
happened
that
during
the
first
six
or
seven
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
was
a
virtual
truce
between
canada
and
new
york
and
the
whole
burden
of
the
war
fell
upon
new

or
rather
upon
massachusetts

was
now
a
witness
of
scenes
the
most
unedifying
at
michilimackinac
was
seen
a
curious
survival
of
customs
the
villages
of
the
hurons
and
ottawas
which
were
side
by
side
separated
only
by
a
fence
were
surrounded
by
a
common
enclosure
of
triple
palisades
which
with
the
addition
of
loopholes
for
musketry
were
precisely
like
those
seen
by
cartier
at
hochelaga
and
by
champlain
in
the
onondaga
country
the
dwellings
which
these
defences
enclosed
were
also
after
the
old
pattern
those
long
arched
structures
covered
with
bark

with

the

this

writes

are
reduced
to

small
number
and
it
is
well
for
us
that
they
are
for
they
are
and
mischievous
with
a
turn
for
intrigue
and
a
capacity
for
large
undertakings
luckily
their
power
is
not
great
but
as
they
can
not
play

they
play

antipathy

the

perhaps
could
not

they
were
opposed
also
to
the
traffic
in
brandy
which
was
favored
by
cadillac
on
the
usual
ground
that
it
attracted
the
indians
and
so
prevented
the
english
from
getting
control
of

argument

reinforced
by

considerations

cadillac
calls
carheil
superior
of
the
mission
the
most
passionate
and
domineering
man
he
ever
knew
and
further
declares
that
the
jesuit
tried
to
provoke
him
to
acts
of
violence
in
order
to
make
matter
of
accusation
against
him

this
was

was
near
succeeding

in

dispute
with

the
he
upbraided
him
sharply
for
permitting
it
to
which
cadillac
replied
that
he
only
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
court
the
jesuit
rejoined
that
he
ought
to
obey
god
and
not
man
on
which
says
the
commandant
i
told
him
that
his
talk
smelt
of
sedition
a
hundred
yards
off
and
begged
that
he
would
amend
it
he
told
me
that
i
gave
myself
airs
that
did
not
belong
to
me
holding
his
fist
before
my
nose
at
the
same
time
i
confess
i
almost
forgot
that
he
was
a
priest
and
felt
for
a
moment
like
knocking
his
jaw
out
of
joint
but
thank
god
i
contented
myself
with
taking
him
by
the
arm
pushing
him
out
and
ordering
him
not
to
come
back
such
being
the
relations
of
the
commandant
and
the
father
superior
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
the
one
complaining
that
he
can
not
get
absolved
from
his
sins
and
the
other
painting
the
morals
and
manners
of
michilimackinac
in
the
blackest
colors
i
have
spoken
elsewhere
of
the
two
opposing
policies
that
divided
canada
the
policies
of
concentration
and
of
expansion
on
the
one
hand
leaving
the
west
to
the
keeping
of
the
jesuits
and
confining
the
population
to
the
borders
of
the
lawrence
on
the
other
the
occupation
of
the
interior
of
the
continent
by
posts
of
war
and
trade
through
the
force
of
events
the
latter
view
had
prevailed
yet
while
the
military
chiefs
of
canada
could
not
but
favor
it
the
jesuits
were
unwilling
to
accept
it
and
various
interests
in
the
colony
still
opposed
it
openly
or
secretly
frontenac
had
been
its
strongest
champion
and
cadillac
followed
in
his
steps
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
time
had
come
for
securing
the
west
for
france
the
strait
which
connects
lake
huron
with
lake
erie
was
the
most
important
of
all
the
western
passes
it
was
the
key
of
the
three
upper
lakes
with
the
vast
countries
watered
by
their
tributaries
and
it
gave
canada
her
readiest
access
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
if
the
french
held
it
the
english
would
be
shut
out
from
the
northwest
if
as
seemed
likely
the
english
should
seize
it
the
canadian
would
be
ruined
the
possession
of
it
by
the
french
would
be
a
constant
curb
and
menace
to
the
five
nations
as
well
as
a
barrier
between
those
still
formidable
tribes
and
the
western
indians
allies
of
canada
and
when
the
intended
french
establishment
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
should
be
made
detroit
would
be
an
indispensable
link
of
communication
between
canada
and
louisiana
denonville
had
recognized
the
importance
of
the
position
and
it
was
by
his
orders
that
greysolon
du
lhut
in
had
occupied
it
for
a
time
and
built
a
picket
fort
near
the
site
of
fort
gratiot
it
would
be
idle
to
imagine
that
the
motives
of
cadillac
were
wholly
patriotic
interests
were
deeply
involved
in
his
plans
and
bitter
opposition
was
certain
the
in
its
nature
was
a
constant
breeder
of
discord
the
people
of
montreal
would
have
the
tribes
come
down
every
summer
from
the
west
and
northwest
and
hold
a
fair
under
the
palisades
of
their
town
it
is
said
that
more
than
four
hundred
french
families
lived
wholly
or
in
part
by
this
home
trade
and
therefore
regarded
with
deep
jealousy
the
establishment
of
interior
posts
which
would
forestall
it
again
every
new
western
post
would
draw
away
trade
from
those
already
established
and
every
trading
license
granted
to
a
company
or
an
individual
would
rouse
the
animosity
of
those
who
had
been
licensed
before
the
prosperity
of
detroit
would
be
the
ruin
of
michilimackinac
and
those
whose
interests
centred
at
the
latter
post
angrily
opposed
the
scheme
of
cadillac
he
laid
his
plans
before
count
de
maurepas
by
a
characteristic
memorial
apparently
written
in
in
this
he
proposed
to
gather
all
the
tribes
of
the
lakes
at
detroit
civilize
them
and
teach
them
french
insomuch
that
from
pagans
they
would
become
children
of
the
church
and
therefore
good
subjects
of
the
king
they
will
form
he
continues
a
considerable
settlement
strong
enough
to
bring
the
english
and
the
iroquois
to
reason
or
with
help
from
montreal
to
destroy
both
of
them
detroit
he
adds
should
be
the
seat
of
trade
which
should
not
be
permitted
in
the
countries
beyond
it
by
this
regulation
the
intolerable
glut
of
which
spoils
the
market
may
be
prevented
this
proposed
restriction
of
the
to
detroit
was
enough
in
itself
to
raise
a
tempest
against
the
whole
scheme
cadillac
well
knows
that
he
has
enemies
pursues
the
memorial
but
he
keeps
on
his
way
without
turning
or
stopping
for
the
noise
of
the
puppies
who
bark
after
him
among
the
essential
features
of
his
plan
was
a
fort
and
a
church
served
not
by
jesuits
alone
but
also
by
récollet
friars
and
priests
of
the
missions
étrangères
the
idea
of
this
ecclesiastical
partnership
was
odious
to
the
jesuits
who
felt
that
the
west
was
their
proper
field
and
that
only
they
had
a
right
there
another
part
of
cadillac
proposal
pleased
them
no
better
this
was
his
plan
of
civilizing
the
indians
and
teaching
them
to
speak
french
for
it
was
the
reproach
of
the
jesuit
missions
that
they
left
the
savage
a
savage
still
and
asked
little
of
him
but
the
practice
of
certain
rites
and
the
passive
acceptance
of
dogmas
to
him
incomprehensible
it
is
essential
says
the
memorial
that
in
this
matter
of
teaching
the
indians
our
language
the
missionaries
should
act
in
good
faith
and
that
his
majesty
should
have
the
goodness
to
impose
his
strictest
orders
upon
them
for
which
there
are
several
good
reasons
the
first
and
most
stringent
is
that
when
members
of
religious
orders
or
other
ecclesiastics
undertake
anything
they
never
let
it
go
the
second
is
that
by
not
teaching
french
to
the
indians
they
make
themselves
necessary
as
interpreters
to
the
king
and
the
governor
the
third
is
that
if
all
indians
spoke
french
all
kinds
of
ecclesiastics
would
be
able
to
instruct
them
this
might
cause
them
the
jesuits
to
lose
some
of
the
presents
they
get
for
though
these
reverend
fathers
come
here
only
for
the
glory
of
god
yet
the
one
thing
does
not
prevent
the
other
meaning
that
god
and
mammon
may
be
served
at
once
nobody
can
deny
that
the
priests
own
three
quarters
of
canada
from
paul
bay
to
quebec
there
is
nothing
but
the
seigniory
of
beauport
that
belongs
to
a
private
person
all
the
rest
which
is
the
best
part
belongs
to
the
jesuits
or
other
ecclesiastics
the
upper
town
of
quebec
is
composed
of
six
or
seven
superb
palaces
belonging
to
hospital
nuns
ursulines
jesuits
récollets
seminary
priests
and
the
bishop
there
may
be
some
forty
private
houses
and
even
these
pay
rent
to
the
ecclesiastics
which
shows
that
one
thing
does
not
prevent
the
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
in
the
words
of
one
of
his
enemies
cadillac
was
not
quite
in
the
odor
of
sanctity
one
may
as
well
knock
one
head
against
a
wall
concludes
the
memorial
as
hope
to
convert
the
indians
in
any
other
way
than
that
of
civilizing
them
for
thus
far
all
the
fruits
of
the
missions
consist
in
the
baptism
of
infants
who
die
before
reaching
the
age
of
reason
this
was
not
literally
true
though
the
results
of
the
jesuit
missions
in
the
west
had
been
meagre
and
transient
to
a
surprising
degree
cadillac
plan
of
a
settlement
at
detroit
was
not
at
first
received
with
favor
by
callières
the
governor
while
the
intendant
champigny
a
fast
friend
of
the
jesuits
strongly
opposed
it
by
their
order
the
chief
inhabitants
of
quebec
met
at
the
château
louis
callières
champigny
and
cadillac
himself
being
present
there
was
a
heated
debate
on
the
after
which
the
intendant
commanded
silence
explained
the
projects
of
cadillac
and
proceeded
to
oppose
them
his
first
point
was
that
the
natives
should
not
be
taught
french
because
the
indian
girls
brought
up
at
the
ursuline
convent
led
looser
lives
than
the
young
squaws
who
had
received
no
instruction
while
it
was
much
the
same
with
the
boys
brought
up
at
the
seminary
de
champigny
returned
the
sarcastic
cadillac
does
great
honor
to
the
ursulines
and
the
seminary
it
is
true
that
some
indian
women
who
have
learned
our
language
have
lived
viciously
but
that
is
because
their
teachers
were
too
stiff
with
them
and
tried
to
make
them
nuns
champigny
position
as
stated
by
his
adversary
was
that
all
intimacy
of
the
indians
with
the
french
is
dangerous
and
corrupting
to
their
morals
and
that
their
only
safety
lies
in
keeping
them
at
a
distance
from
the
settlements
this
was
the
view
of
the
jesuits
and
there
is
much
to
be
said
in
its
favor
but
it
remains
not
the
less
true
that
conversion
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
civilization
or
it
is
a
failure
and
a
fraud
cadillac
was
not
satisfied
with
the
results
of
the
meeting
at
the
château
louis
and
he
wrote
to
the
minister
you
can
never
hope
that
this
business
will
succeed
if
it
is
discussed
here
on
the
spot
canada
is
a
country
of
cabals
and
intrigues
and
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
so
many
different
interests
he
sailed
for
france
apparently
in
the
autumn
of
to
urge
his
scheme
at
court
here
he
had
an
interview
with
the
colonial
minister
ponchartrain
to
whom
he
represented
the
military
and
political
expediency
of
his
proposed
establishment
and
in
a
letter
which
seems
to
be
addressed
to
la
touche
chief
clerk
in
the
department
of
marine
and
colonies
he
promised
that
the
execution
of
his
plan
would
insure
the
safety
of
canada
and
the
ruin
of
the
british
colonies
he
asked
for
fifty
soldiers
and
fifty
canadians
to
begin
the
work
to
be
followed
in
the
next
year
by
twenty
or
thirty
families
and
by
two
hundred
picked
men
of
various
trades
sent
out
at
the
king
charge
along
with
priests
of
several
communities
and
nuns
to
attend
the
sick
and
teach
the
indian
girls
i
can
not
tell
you
continues
cadillac
the
efforts
my
enemies
have
made
to
deprive
me
of
the
honor
of
executing
my
project
but
so
soon
as
de
ponchartrain
decides
in
its
favor
the
whole
country
will
applaud
it
ponchartrain
accepted
the
plan
and
cadillac
returned
to
canada
commissioned
to
execute
it
early
in
june
he
left
la
chine
with
a
hundred
men
in
canoes
loaded
with
provisions
goods
munitions
and
tools
he
was
accompanied
by
alphonse
de
tonty
brother
of
henri
de
tonty
the
companion
of
la
salle
and
by
two
lieutenants
dugué
and
chacornacle
together
with
a
jesuit
and
a
récollet
following
the
difficult
route
of
the
ottawa
and
lake
huron
they
reached
their
destination
on
the
of
july
and
built
a
picket
fort
sixty
yards
square
which
by
order
of
the
governor
they
named
fort
ponchartrain
it
stood
near
the
west
bank
of
the
strait
about
forty
paces
from
the
water
thus
was
planted
the
germ
of
the
city
of
detroit
cadillac
sent
back
chacornacle
with
the
report
of
what
he
had
done
and
a
description
of
the
country
written
in
a
strain
of
swelling
and
gushing
rhetoric
in
singular
contrast
with
his
usual
sarcastic
utterances
none
but
enemies
of
the
truth
his
letter
concludes
are
enemies
of
this
establishment
so
necessary
to
the
glory
of
the
king
the
progress
of
religion
and
the
destruction
of
the
throne
of
baal
what
he
had
perhaps
still
more
at
heart
was
making
money
out
of
it
by
the
by
command
of
the
king
a
radical
change
had
lately
been
made
in
this
chief
commerce
of
canada
and
the
entire
control
of
it
had
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
company
in
which
all
canadians
might
take
shares
but
as
the
risks
were
great
and
the
conditions
the
number
of
subscribers
was
not
much
above
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
rest
of
the
colony
found
themselves
shut
out
from
the
trade
to
the
ruin
of
some
and
the
injury
of
all
all
trade
in
furs
was
restricted
to
detroit
and
fort
frontenac
both
of
which
were
granted
to
the
company
subject
to
be
resumed
by
the
king
at
his
pleasure
the
company
was
to
repay
the
eighty
thousand
francs
which
the
expedition
to
detroit
had
cost
and
to
this
were
added
various
other
burdens
the
king
however
was
to
maintain
the
garrison
all
the
affairs
of
the
company
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
seven
directors
who
began
immediately
to
complain
that
their
burdens
were
too
heavy
and
to
beg
for
more
privileges
while
an
outcry
against
the
privileges
already
granted
rose
from
those
who
had
not
taken
shares
in
the
enterprise
both
in
the
company
and
out
of
it
there
was
nothing
but
discontent
none
were
worse
pleased
than
the
two
jesuits
carheil
and
marest
who
saw
their
flocks
at
michilimackinac
both
hurons
and
ottawas
lured
away
to
a
new
home
at
detroit
cadillac
took
a
peculiar
satisfaction
in
depriving
carheil
of
his
converts
and
in
we
find
him
writing
to
the
minister
ponchartrain
that
only
hurons
are
left
at
michilimackinac
and
i
hope
he
adds
that
in
the
autumn
i
shall
pluck
this
last
feather
from
his
wing
and
i
am
convinced
that
this
obstinate
priest
will
die
in
his
parish
without
one
parishioner
to
bury
him
if
the
indians
came
to
detroit
the
french
would
not
come
cadillac
had
asked
for
five
or
six
families
as
the
modest
beginning
of
a
settlement
but
not
one
had
appeared
the
indians
too
were
angry
because
the
company
asked
too
much
for
its
goods
while
the
company
complained
that
a
forbidden
trade
fatal
to
its
interests
went
on
through
all
the
region
of
the
upper
lakes
it
was
easy
to
ordain
a
monopoly
but
impossible
to
enforce
it
the
prospects
of
the
new
establishment
were
deplorable
and
cadillac
lost
no
time
in
presenting
his
views
of
the
situation
to
the
court
detroit
is
good
or
it
is
bad
he
writes
to
ponchartrain
if
it
is
good
it
ought
to
be
sustained
without
allowing
the
people
of
canada
to
deliberate
any
more
about
it
if
it
is
bad
the
court
ought
to
make
up
its
mind
concerning
it
as
soon
as
may
be
i
have
said
what
i
think
i
have
explained
the
situation
you
have
felt
the
need
of
detroit
and
its
utility
for
the
glory
of
god
the
progress
of
religion
and
the
good
of
the
colony
nothing
is
left
me
to
do
but
to
imitate
the
governor
of
the
holy
city
take
water
and
wash
my
hands
of
it
his
aim
now
appears
he
says
that
if
detroit
were
made
a
separate
government
and
he
were
put
at
the
head
of
it
its
prospects
would
improve
you
may
well
believe
that
the
company
cares
for
nothing
but
to
make
a
profit
out
of
it
it
only
wants
to
have
a
storehouse
and
clerks
no
officers
no
troops
no
inhabitants
take
this
business
in
hand
monseigneur
and
i
promise
that
in
two
years
your
detroit
shall
be
established
of
itself
he
then
informs
the
minister
that
as
the
company
complain
of
losing
money
he
has
told
them
that
if
they
will
make
over
their
rights
to
him
he
will
pay
them
back
all
their
past
outlays
i
promise
you
he
informs
ponchartrain
that
if
they
accept
my
proposal
and
you
approve
it
i
will
make
our
detroit
flourish
judge
if
it
is
agreeable
to
me
to
have
to
answer
for
my
actions
to
five
or
six
merchants
the
directors
of
the
company
who
not
long
ago
were
blacking
their
masters
boots
he
is
scarcely
more
reserved
as
to
the
jesuits
i
do
what
i
can
to
make
them
my
friends
but
impiety
apart
one
had
better
sin
against
god
than
against
them
for
in
that
case
one
gets
one
pardon
whereas
in
the
other
the
offence
is
never
forgiven
in
this
world
and
perhaps
never
would
be
in
the
other
if
their
credit
were
as
great
there
as
it
is
here
the
letters
of
cadillac
to
the
court
are
unique
no
governor
of
new
france
not
even
the
audacious
frontenac
ever
wrote
to
a
minister
of
louis
xiv
with
such
freedom
of
language
as
this
singular
personage
a
mere
captain
in
the
colony
troops
and
to
a
more
stable
and
balanced
character
it
would
have
been
impossible
cadillac
proposal
was
accepted
the
company
was
required
to
abandon
detroit
to
him
on
his
paying
them
the
expenses
they
had
incurred
their
monopoly
was
transferred
to
him
but
as
far
as
concerned
his
trade
was
limited
to
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
the
governor
was
ordered
to
give
him
as
many
soldiers
as
he
might
want
permit
as
many
persons
to
settle
at
detroit
as
might
choose
to
do
so
and
provide

the
minister
exhorted
him
to
quarrel
no
more
with
the
jesuits
or
anybody
else
to
banish
blasphemy
and
bad
morals
from
the
post
and

offend

not

detroit
lingered
on
in
a
weak
and
troubled
infancy
disturbed
as
we
shall
see
by
startling
incidents
its
occupation
by
the
french
produced
a
noteworthy
result
the
five
nations
filled
with
jealousy
and
alarm
appealed
to
the
king
of

for
protection
and
the
better
to
insure
it

the
whole
country
from

ontario
northward

superior
and
westward
as
far
as
chicago
unto
our
souveraigne
lord
king
william
the
third

his
heirs
and
successors
forever
this
territory
is
described
in
the
deed
as
being
about
eight
hundred
miles
long
and
four
hundred
wide
and
was
claimed
by
the
five
nations
as
theirs
by
right
of
conquest
it
of
course
included
detroit
itself
the
conveyance
was
drawn
by
the
english
authorities
at
albany
in
a
form
to
suit
their
purposes
and
included
terms
of
subjection
and
sovereignty
which
the
signers
could
understand
but
imperfectly
if
at
all
the
five
nations
gave
away
their
land
to
no
purpose
the
french
remained
in
undisturbed
possession
of
detroit
the
english
made
no
attempt
to
enforce
their
title
but
they
put
the
deed
on
file
and
used
it
long
after
as
the
base
of
their
claim
to
the

for
untold
ages
maine
had
been
one
unbroken
forest
and
it
was
so
still
only
along
the
rocky
seaboard
or
on
the
lower
waters
of
one
or
two
great
rivers
a
few
rough
settlements
had
gnawed
slight
indentations
into
this
wilderness
of
woods
and
a
little
farther
inland
some
dismal
clearing
around
a
blockhouse
or
stockade
let
in
the
sunlight
to
a
soil
that
had
lain
in
shadow
time
out
of
mind
this
waste
of
savage
vegetation
survives
in
some
part
to
this
day
with
the
same
prodigality
of
vital
force
the
same
struggle
for
existence
and
mutual
havoc
that
mark
all
organized
beings
from
men
to
mushrooms
young
seedlings
in
millions
spring
every
summer
from
the
black
mould
rich
with
the
decay
of
those
that
had
preceded
them
crowding
choking
and
killing
one
another
perishing
by
their
very
abundance
all
but
a
scattered
few
stronger
than
the
rest
or
more
fortunate
in
position
which
survive
by
blighting
those
about
them
they
in
turn
as
they
grow
interlock
their
boughs
and
repeat
in
a
season
or
two
the
same
process
of
mutual
suffocation
the
forest
is
full
of
lean
saplings
dead
or
dying
with
vainly
stretching
towards
the
light
not
one
infant
tree
in
a
thousand
lives
to
maturity
yet
these
survivors
form
an
innumerable
host
pressed
together
in
struggling
confusion
squeezed
out
of
symmetry
and
robbed
of
normal
development
as
men
are
said
to
be
in
the
level
sameness
of
democratic
society
seen
from
above
their
mingled
tops
spread
in
a
sea
of
verdure
basking
in
light
seen
from
below
all
is
shadow
through
which
spots
of
timid
sunshine
steal
down
among
legions
of
lank
mossy
trunks
toadstools
and
rank
ferns
protruding
roots
matted
bushes
and
rotting
carcasses
of
fallen
trees
a
generation
ago
one
might
find
here
and
there
the
rugged
trunk
of
some
great
pine
lifting
its
verdant
spire
above
the
undistinguished
myriads
of
the
forest
the
woods
of
maine
had
their
aristocracy
but
the
axe
of
the
woodman
has
laid
them
low
and
these
lords
of
the
wilderness
are
seen
no
more
the
life
and
light
of
this
grim
solitude
were
in
its
countless
streams
and
lakes
from
little
brooks
stealing
clear
and
cold
under
the
alders
full
of
the
small
fry
of
trout
to
the
mighty
arteries
of
the
penobscot
and
the
kennebec
from
the
great
reservoir
of
moosehead
to
a
thousand
nameless
ponds
shining
in
the
hollow
places
of
the
forest
it
had
and
still
has
its
beast
of
prey
wolves
savage
cowardly
and
mean
bears
gentle
and
mild
compared
to
their
grisly
relatives
of
the
far
west
vegetarians
when
they
can
do
no
better
and
not
without
something
grotesque
and
quaint
in
manners
and
behavior
sometimes
though
rarely
the
strong
and
sullen
wolverine
frequently
the
lynx
and
now
and
then
the
fierce
and
agile
cougar
the
human
denizens
of
this
wilderness
were
no
less
fierce
and
far
more
dangerous
these
were
the
various
tribes
and
of
the
abenakis
whose
villages
were
on
the
saco
the
kennebec
the
penobscot
and
the
other
great
watercourses
most
of
them
had
been
converted
by
the
jesuits
and
as
we
have
seen
already
some
had
been
persuaded
to
remove
to
canada
like
the
converted
iroquois
of
caughnawaga
the
rest
remained
in
their
native
haunts
where
under
the
direction
of
their
missionaries
they
could
be
used
to
keep
the
english
settlements
in
check
we
know
how
busily
they
plied
their
tomahawks
in
william
and
mary
war
and
what
havoc
they
made
among
the
scattered
settlements
of
the
border
another
war
with
france
was
declared
on
the
fourth
of
may
on
which
the
abenakis
again
assumed
a
threatening
attitude
in
june
of
the
next
year
dudley
governor
of
massachusetts
called
the
chiefs
of
the
various
bands
to
a
council
at
casco
here
presently
appeared
the
norridgewocks
from
the
kennebec
the
penobscots
and
androscoggins
from
the
rivers
that
bear
their
names
the
penacooks
from
the
merrimac
and
the
pequawkets
from
the
saco
all
well
armed
and
daubed
with
ceremonial
paint
the
principal
among
them
gathered
under
a
large
tent
were
addressed
by
dudley
in
a
conciliatory
speech
their
orator
replied
that
they
wanted
nothing
but
peace
and
that
their
thoughts
were
as
far
from
war
as
the
sun
was
from
the
earth
words
which
they
duly
confirmed
by
a
belt
of
wampum
presents
were
distributed
among
them
and
received
with
apparent
satisfaction
while
two
of
their
principal
chiefs
known
as
captain
samuel
and
captain
bomazeen
declared
that
several
french
missionaries
had
lately
come
among
them
to
excite
them
against
the
english
but
that
they
were
firm
as
mountains
and
would
remain
so
as
long
as
the
sun
and
moon
endured
they
ended
the
meeting
with
dancing
singing
and
whoops
of
joy
followed
by
a
volley
of
musketry
answered
by
another
from
the
english
it
was
discovered
however
that
the
indians
had
loaded
their
guns
with
ball
intending
as
the
english
believed
to
murder
dudley
and
his
attendants
if
they
could
have
done
so
without
danger
to
their
chiefs
whom
the
governor
had
prudently
kept
about
him
it
was
afterwards
found
if
we
may
believe
a
highly
respectable
member
of
the
party
that
two
hundred
french
and
indians
were
on
their
way
resolved
to
seize
the
governor
council
and
gentlemen
and
then
to
sacrifice
the
inhabitants
at
pleasure
but
when
they
arrived
the
english
officials
had
been
gone
three
days
the
french
governor
vaudreuil
says
that
about
this
time
some
of
the
abenakis
were
killed
or
maltreated
by
englishmen
it
may
have
been
so
desperadoes
drunk
or
sober
were
not
rare
along
the
frontier
but
vaudreuil
gives
no
particulars
and
the
only
english
outrage
that
appears
on
record
at
the
time
was
the
act
of
a
gang
of
vagabonds
who
plundered
the
house
of
the
younger
where
the
town
of
castine
now
stands
he
was
abenaki
by
his
mother
but
he
was
absent
when
the
attack
took
place
and
the
marauders
seem
to
have
shed
no
blood
nevertheless
within
six
weeks
after
the
treaty
of
casco
every
unprotected
farmhouse
in
maine
was
in
a
blaze
the
settlements
of
maine
confined
to
the
southwestern
corner
of
what
is
now
the
state
of
maine
extended
along
the
coast
in
a
feeble
and
broken
line
from
kittery
to
casco
ten
years
of
murderous
warfare
had
almost
ruined
them
east
of
the
village
of
wells
little
was
left
except
one
or
two
forts
and
the
garrisons
which
were
private
houses
pierced
with
loopholes
and
having
an
upper
story
projecting
over
the
lower
so
that
the
defenders
could
fire
down
on
assailants
battering
the
door
or
piling
fagots
against
the
walls
a
few
were
fenced
with
palisades
as
was
the
case
with
the
house
of
joseph
storer
at
the
east
end
of
wells
where
an
overwhelming
force
of
french
and
indians
had
been
gallantly
repulsed
in
the
summer
of
these
fortified
houses
were
however
very
rarely
attacked
except
by
surprise
and
treachery
in
case
of
alarm
such
of
the
inhabitants
as
found
time
took
refuge
in
them
with
their
families
and
left
their
dwellings
to
the
flames
for
the
first
thought
of
the
settler
was
to
put
his
women
and
children
beyond
reach
of
the
there
were
several
of
these
asylums
in
different
parts
of
wells
and
without
them
the
place
must
have
been
abandoned
in
the
little
settlement
of
york
farther
westward
there
were
five
of
them
which
had
saved
a
part
of
the
inhabitants
when
the
rest
were
surprised
and
massacred
wells
was
a
long
straggling
settlement
consisting
at
the
beginning
of
william
and
mary
war
of
about
eighty
houses
and
strung
at
intervals
along
the
north
side
of
the
rough
track
known
as
the
king
road
which
ran
parallel
to
the
sea
behind
the
houses
were
rude
pastures
and
behind
these
again
the
primeval
forest
the
cultivated
land
was
on
the
south
side
of
the
road
in
front
of
the
houses
and
beyond
it
spread
great
bordering
the
sea
and
haunted
by
innumerable
the
settlements
of
maine
were
a
dependency
of
massachusetts
a
position
that
did
not
please
their
inhabitants
but
which
they
accepted
because
they
needed
the
help
of
their
puritan
neighbors
from
whom
they
differed
widely
both
in
their
qualities
and
in
their
faults
the
indian
wars
that
checked
their
growth
had
kept
them
in
a
condition
more
than
half
barbarous
they
were
a
and
race
for
though
tea
and
coffee
were
scarcely
known
the
land
flowed
with
new
england
rum
which
was
ranked
among
the
necessaries
of
life
the
better
sort
could
read
and
write
in
a
bungling
way
but
many
were
wholly
illiterate
and
it
was
not
till
long
after
queen
anne
war
that
the
remoter
settlements
established
schools
taught
by
poor
students
from
harvard
or
less
competent
instructors
and
held
at
first
in
private
houses
or
under
sheds
the
church
at
wells
had
been
burned
by
the
indians
and
though
the
settlers
were
beggared
by
the
war
they
voted
in
to
build
another
the
new
temple
begun
in
was
a
plain
wooden
structure
thirty
feet
square
for
want
of
money
the
windows
long
remained
unglazed
the
walls
without
plaster
and
the
floor
without
seats
yet
services
were
duly
held
here
under
direction
of
the
minister
samuel
emery
to
whom
they
paid
a
year
half
in
provincial
currency
and
half
in
and
in
spite
of
these
efforts
to
maintain
public
worship
they
were
far
from
being
a
religious
community
nor
were
they
a
peaceful
one
gossip
and
scandal
ran
riot
social
jealousies
abounded
and
under
what
seemed
entire
democratic
equality
the
lazy
drunken
and
shiftless
envied
the
industrious
and
thrifty
wells
was
infested
moreover
by
several
frightfully
turbulent
women
as
the
chronicle
styles
them
from
whose
rabid
tongues
the
minister
himself
did
not
always
escape
and
once
in
its
earlier
days
the
town
had
been
indicted
for
not
providing
a
to
correct
these
breeders
of
discord
judicial
officers
were
sometimes
informally
chosen
by
popular
vote
and
sometimes
appointed
by
the
governor
of
massachusetts
from
among
the
inhabitants
as
they
knew
no
law
they
gave
judgment
according
to
their
own
ideas
of
justice
and
their
sentences
were
oftener
wanting
in
wisdom
than
in
severity
until
after
the
county
courts
met
by
beat
of
drum
at
some
of
the
primitive
inns
or
taverns
with
which
the
frontier
abounded
at
wells
and
other
outlying
and
endangered
hamlets

was
still

the
richest

in

of

and
a
sturdy
man
who
loved
the
woods
and
whose
frequent
hunting
trips
sometimes
led
him
nearly
to
the
white
mountains
distant
gunshots
were
heard
from
the
westward
and
his
quick
eye
presently
discovered
indians
approaching
on
which
he
told
his
frightened
wife
to
go
with
their
infant
to
a
certain
beyond
the
creek
while
he
waited
to
learn
whether
the
strangers
were
friends
or
foes
that
morning
several
parties
of
indians
had
stolen
out
of
the
dismal
woods
behind
the
houses
and
farms
of
wells
and
approached
different
dwellings
of
the
settlement
at
about
the
same
time
they
entered
the
cabin
of
thomas
wells
where
his
wife
lay
in
the
pains
of
childbirth
and
murdered
her
and
her
two
small
children
at
the
same
time
they
killed
joseph
sayer
a
neighbor
of

with
all
his

meanwhile
stephen

having
sent
his
wife
and
child
to
a
safe
distance
returned
to
his
blacksmith
shop
and
seeing
nobody
gave
a
defiant
whoop
on
which
four
indians
sprang
at
him
from
the
bushes
he
escaped
through
a
of
the
shop
eluded
his
pursuers
and
found
his
wife
and

in
a
cornfield
where
the
woman
had
fainted
with
fright
they
spent
the
night
in
the
woods
and
on
the
next
day
after
a
circuit
of
nine
miles
reached
the
palisaded
house
of

found
the

in
distress

agitation

useless
to
record
the
names
and
fate
of
the
sufferers
in
all
chiefly
women
and
children
were
killed
or
carried
off
and
then
the
indians
disappeared
as
quickly
and
silently
as
they
had
come
leaving
many
of
the
houses
in
flames
this
raid
upon
wells
was
only
part
of
a
combined
attack
on
all
the
settlements
from
that
place
to
casco
those
eastward
of
wells
had
been
as
we
have
seen
abandoned
in
the
last
war
excepting
the
forts
and
fortified
houses
but
the
inhabitants
reassured
no
doubt
by
the
treaty
of
casco
had
begun
to
return
on
this
same
day
the
tenth
of
august
they
were
startled
from
their
security
a
band
of
indians
mixed
with
frenchmen
fell
upon
the
settlements
about
the
stone
fort
near
the
falls
of
the
saco
killed
eleven
persons
captured
and
vainly
attacked
the
fort
itself
others
surprised
the
settlers
at
a
place
called
spurwink
and
killed
or
captured
others
again
destroyed
the
huts
of
the
fishermen
at
cape
porpoise
and
attacked
the
fortified
house
at
winter
harbor
the
inmates
of
which
after
a
brave
resistance
were
forced
to
capitulate
the
settlers
at
scarborough
were
also
in
a
fortified
house
where
they
made
a
long
and
obstinate
defence
till
help
at
last
arrived
nine
families
were
settled
at
purpooduck
point
near
the
present
city
of
portland
they
had
no
place
of
refuge
and
the
men
being
no
doubt
fishermen
were
all
absent
when
the
indians
burst
into
the
hamlet
butchered
women
and
children
and
carried
off
eight
the
fort
at
casco
or
falmouth
was
held
by
major
march
with
men
he
had
no
thought
of
danger
when
three
chiefs
from
norridgewock
appeared
with
a
white
flag
and
asked
for
an
interview
as
they
seemed
to
be
alone
and
unarmed
he
went
to
meet
them
followed
by
two
or
three
soldiers
and
accompanied
by
two
old
men
named
phippeny
and
kent
inhabitants
of
the
place
they
had
hardly
reached
the
spot
when
the
three
chiefs
drew
hatchets
from
under
a
kind
of
mantle
which
they
wore
and
sprang
upon
them
while
other
indians
ambushed
near
by
leaped
up
and
joined
in
the
attack
the
two
old
men
were
killed
at
once
but
march
who
was
noted
for
strength
and
agility
wrenched
a
hatchet
from
one
of
his
assailants
and
kept
them
all
at
bay
till
sergeant
hook
came
to
his
aid
with
a
file
of
men
and
drove
them
off
they
soon
reappeared
burned
the
deserted
cabins
in
the
neighborhood
and
beset
the
garrison
in
numbers
that
continually
increased
till
in
a
few
days
the
entire
force
that
had
been
busied
in
ravaging
the
scattered
settlements
was
gathered
around
the
place
it
consisted
of
about
five
hundred
indians
of
several
tribes
and
a
few
frenchmen
under
an
officer
named
beaubassin
being
elated
with
past
successes
they
laid
siege
to
the
fort
sheltering
themselves
under
a
steep
bank
by
the
and
burrowing
their
way
towards
the
rampart
march
could
not
dislodge
them
and
they
continued
their
approaches
till
the
third
day
when
captain
southack
with
the
massachusetts
armed
vessel
known
as
the
province
galley
sailed
into
the
harbor
recaptured
three
small
vessels
that
the
indians
had
taken
along
the
coast
and
destroyed
a
great
number
of
their
canoes
on
which
they
gave
up
their
enterprise
and
disappeared
such
was
the
beginning
of
queen
anne
war
these
attacks
were
due
less
to
the
abenakis
than
to
the
french
who
set
them
on
monsieur
de
vaudreuil
writes
the
jesuit
historian
charlevoix
formed
a
party
of
these
savages
to
whom
he
joined
some
frenchmen
under
the
direction
of
the
sieur
de
beaubassin
when
they
effected
some
ravages
of
no
great
consequence
they
killed
however
about
three
hundred
men
this
last
statement
is
doubly
incorrect
the
whole
number
of
persons
killed
and
carried
off
during
the
august
attacks
did
not
much
exceed
one
hundred
and
sixty
and
these
were
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
from
octogenarians
to
newborn
infants
the
men
among
them
were
few
as
most
of
the
attacks
were
made
upon
unprotected
houses
in
the
absence
of
the
head
of
the
family
and
the
only
fortified
place
captured
was
the
at
winter
harbor
which
surrendered
on
terms
of
capitulation
the
instruments
of
this
ignoble
warfare
and
the
revolting
atrocities
that
accompanied
it
were
all
or
nearly
all
converted
indians
of
the
missions
charlevoix
has
no
word
of
disapproval
for
it
and
seems
to
regard
its
partial
success
as
a
gratifying
one
so
far
as
it
went
one
of
the
objects
was
no
doubt
to
check
the
progress
of
the
english
settlements
but
pursues
charlevoix
the
essential
point
was
to
commit
the
abenakis
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
not
draw
back
this
object
was
constantly
kept
in
view
the
french
claimed
at
this
time
that
the
territory
of
acadia
reached
as
far
westward
as
the
kennebec
which
therefore
formed
in
their
view
the
boundary
between
the
rival
nations
and
they
trusted
in
the
abenakis
to
defend
this
assumed
line
of
demarcation
but
the
abenakis
sorely
needed
english
guns
knives
hatchets
and
kettles
and
nothing
but
the
utmost
vigilance
could
prevent
them
from
coming
to
terms
with
those
who
could
supply
their
necessities
hence
the
policy
of
the
french
authorities
on
the
frontier
of
new
england
was
the
opposite
of
their
policy
on
the
frontier
of
new
york
they
left
the
latter
undisturbed
lest
by
attacking
the
dutch
and
english
settlers
they
should
stir
up
the
five
nations
to
attack
canada
while
on
the
other
hand
they
constantly
spurred
the
abenakis
against
new
england
in
order
to
avert
the
dreaded
event
of
their
making
peace
with
her
the
attack
on
wells
casco
and
the
intervening
settlements
was
followed
by
murders
and
depredations
that
lasted
through
the
autumn
and
extended
along
two
hundred
miles
of
frontier
thirty
indians
attacked
the
village
of
hampton
killed
the
widow
mussey
a
famous
quakeress
and
then
fled
to
escape
pursuit
at
black
point
nineteen
men
going
to
their
work
in
the
meadows
were
ambushed
by
two
hundred
indians
and
all
but
one
were
shot
or
captured
the
fort
was
next
attacked
it
was
garrisoned
by
eight
men
under
lieutenant
wyatt
who
stood
their
ground
for
some
time
and
then
escaped
by
means
of
a
sloop
in
the
harbor
at
york
the
wife
and
children
of
arthur
brandon
were
killed
and
the
widow
parsons
and
her
daughter
carried
off
at
berwick
the
indians
attacked
the
fortified
house
of
andrew
neal
but
were
repulsed
with
the
loss
of
nine
killed
and
many
wounded
for
which
they
revenged
themselves
by
burning
alive
joseph
ring
a
prisoner
whom
they
had
taken
early
in
february
a
small
party
of
them
hovered
about
the
fortified
house
of
joseph
bradley
at
haverhill
till
seeing
the
gate
open
and
nobody
on
the
watch
they
rushed
in
the
woman
of
the
house
was
boiling
soap
and
in
her
desperation
she
snatched
up
the
kettle
and
threw
the
contents
over
them
with
such
effect
that
one
of
them
it
is
said
was
scalded
to
death
the
man
who
should
have
been
on
the
watch
was
killed
and
several
persons
were
captured
including
the
woman
it
was
the
second
time
that
she
had
been
a
prisoner
in
indian
hands
half
starved
and
bearing
a
heavy
load
she
followed
her
captors
in
their
hasty
retreat
towards
canada
after
a
time
she
was
safely
delivered
of
an
infant
in
the
midst
of
the
winter
forest
but
the
child
pined
for
want
of
sustenance
and
the
indians
hastened
its
death
by
throwing
hot
coals
into
its
mouth
when
it
cried
the
astonishing
vitality
of
the
woman
carried
her
to
the
end
of
the
frightful
journey
a
frenchman
bought
her
from
the
indians
and
she
was
finally
ransomed
by
her
husband
by
far
the
most
dangerous
and
harassing
attacks
were
those
of
small
parties
skulking
under
the
edge
of
the
forest
or
lying
hidden
for
days
together
watching
their
opportunity
to
murder
unawares
and
vanishing
when
they
had
done
so
against
such
an
enemy
there
was
no
defence
the
massachusetts
government
sent
a
troop
of
horse
to
portsmouth
and
another
to
wells
these
had
the
advantage
of
rapid
movement
in
case
of
alarm
along
the
roads
and
from
settlement
to
settlement
but
once
in
the
woods
their
horses
were
worse
than
useless
and
they
could
only
fight
on
foot
fighting
however
was
rarely
possible
for
on
reaching
the
scene
of
action
they
found
nothing
but
mangled
corpses
and
burning
houses
the
best
defence
was
to
take
the
offensive
in
september
governor
dudley
sent
three
hundred
and
sixty
men
to
the
upper
saco
the
haunt
of
the
pequawket
tribe
but
the
place
was
deserted
major
now
colonel
march
soon
after
repeated
the
attempt
killing
six
indians
and
capturing
as
many
more
the
general
court
offered
for
every
indian
scalp
and
one
captain
tyng
in
consequence
surprised
an
indian
village
in
midwinter
and
brought
back
five
of
these
disgusting
trophies
in
the
spring
of
word
came
from
albany
that
a
band
of
french
indians
had
built
a
fort
and
planted
corn
at
coos
meadows
high
up
the
river
connecticut
on
this
one
caleb
lyman
with
five
friendly
indians
probably
mohegans
set
out
from
northampton
and
after
a
long
march
through
the
forest
surprised
under
cover
of
a
thunderstorm
a
wigwam
containing
nine
warriors
bound
no
doubt
against
the
frontier
they
killed
seven
of
them
and
this
was
all
that
was
done
at
present
in
the
way
of
reprisal
or
prevention
the
murders
and
burnings
along
the
borders
were
destined
to
continue
with
little
variety
and
little
interruption
during
ten
years
it
was
a
repetition
of
what
the
pedantic
cotton
mather
calls
or
the
woful
decade
of
william
and
mary
war
the
wonder
is
that
the
outlying
settlements
were
not
abandoned
these
ghastly
insidious
and
dangers
demanded
a
more
obstinate
courage
than
the
hottest
battle
in
the
open
field
one
curious
frontier
incident
may
be
mentioned
here
though
it
did
not
happen
till
towards
the
end
of
the
war
in
spite
of
poverty
danger
and
tribulation
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
did
not
cease
among
the
sturdy
borderers
and
on
a
day
in
september
there
was
a
notable
wedding
feast
at
the
palisaded
house
of
john
wheelwright
one
of
the
chief
men
of
wells
elisha
plaisted
was
to
espouse
wheelwright
daughter
hannah
and
many
guests
were
assembled
some
from
portsmouth
and
even
beyond
it
probably
most
of
them
came
in
sailboats
for
the
way
by
land
was
full
of
peril
especially
on
the
road
from
york
which
ran
through
dense
woods
where
indians
often
waylaid
the
traveller
the
father
was
present
with
the
rest
it
was
a
concourse
of
men
in
homespun
and
women
and
girls
in
such
improvised
finery
as
their
poor
resources
could
supply
possibly
in
default
of
better
some
wore
nightgowns
more
or
less
disguised
over
their
daily
dress
as
happened
on
similar
occasions
half
a
century
later
among
the
frontiersmen
of
west
virginia
after
an
evening
of
rough
merriment
and
gymnastic
dancing
the
guests
lay
down
to
sleep
under
the
roof
of
their
host
or
in
adjacent
barns
and
sheds
when
morning
came
and
they
were
preparing
to
depart
it
was
found
that
two
horses
were
missing
and
not
doubting
that
they
had
strayed
away
three
young
men
sergeant
tucker
joshua
downing
and
isaac
cole
went
to
find
them
in
a
few
minutes
several
gunshots
were
heard
the
three
young
men
did
not
return
downing
and
cole
were
killed
and
tucker
was
wounded
and
made
prisoner
believing
that
as
usual
the
attack
came
from
some
small
elisha
plaisted
and
eight
or
ten
more
threw
themselves
on
the
horses
that
stood
saddled
before
the
house
and
galloped
across
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
while
others
ran
to
cut
off
the
enemy
retreat
a
volley
was
presently
heard
and
several
of
the
party
were
seen
running
back
towards
the
house
elisha
plaisted
and
his
companions
had
fallen
into
an
ambuscade
of
two
hundred
indians
one
or
more
of
them
were
shot
and
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
was
captured
the
distress
of
his
young
wife
who
was
but
eighteen
may
be
imagined
two
companies
of
armed
men
in
the
pay
of
massachusetts
were
then
in
wells
and
some
of
them
had
come
to
the
wedding
seventy
marksmen
went
to
meet
the
indians
who
ensconced
themselves
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
whence
they
could
not
be
dislodged
there
was
some
desultory
firing
and
one
of
the
combatants
was
killed
on
each
side
after
which
the
whites
gave
up
the
attack
and
lieutenant
banks
went
forward
with
a
flag
of
truce
in
the
hope
of
ransoming
the
prisoners
he
was
met
by
six
chiefs
among
whom
were
two
noted
indians
of
his
acquaintance
bomazeen
and
captain
nathaniel
they
well
knew
that
the
living
plaisted
was
worth
more
than
his
scalp
and
though
they
would
not
come
to
terms
at
once
they
promised
to
meet
the
english
at
richmond
island
in
a
few
days
and
give
up
both
him
and
tucker
on
payment
of
a
sufficient
ransom
the
flag
of
truce
was
respected
and
banks
came
back
safe
bringing
a
hasty
note
to
the
elder
plaisted
from
his
captive
son
this
note
now
lies
before
me
and
it
runs
thus
in
the
dutiful
formality
of
the
olden

the
latter
of
whom
while
trading
constantly
with

were
rarely

to
a
raid
against

the
command
was
given
to
the
younger
hertel
de
rouville
who
was
accompanied
by
four
of
his
brothers
they
began
their
march
in
the
depth
of
winter
journeyed
nearly
three
hundred
miles
on
through
the
forest
and
approached
their
destination
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
february
it
was
the
village
of
deerfield
which
then
formed
the
extreme
northwestern
frontier
of
massachusetts
its
feeble
neighbor
the
infant
settlement
of
northfield
a
little
higher
up
the
connecticut
having
been
abandoned
during
the
last
war
rouville
halted
his
followers
at
a
place
now
called
petty
plain
two
miles
from
the
village
and
here
under
the
shelter
of
a
pine
forest
they
all
lay
hidden
shivering
with
cold
for
they
dared
not
make
fires
and
hungry
as
wolves
for
their
provisions
were
spent
though
their
numbers
by
the
lowest
account
were
nearly
equal
to
the
whole
population
of
deerfield
men
women
and
children
they
had
no
thought
of
an
open
attack
but
trusted
to
darkness
and
surprise
for
an
easy
victory
deerfield
stood
on
a
plateau
above
the
river
meadows
and
the
houses
in
all
were
chiefly
along
the
road
towards
the
villages
of
hadley
and
hatfield
a
few
miles
distant
in
the
middle
of
the
place
on
a
rising
ground
called
hill
was
a
small
square
wooden
this
with
about
fifteen
private
houses
besides
barns
and
sheds
was
enclosed
by
a
fence
of
palisades
eight
feet
high
flanked
by
mounts
or
blockhouses
at
two
or
more
of
the
corners
the
four
sides
of
this
palisaded
enclosure
which
was
called
the
fort
measured
in
all
no
less
than
two
hundred
and
two
rods
and
within
it
lived
some
of
the
principal
inhabitants
of
the
village
of
which
it
formed
the
centre
or
citadel
chief
among
its
inmates
was
john
williams
the
minister
a
man
of
character
and
education
who
after
graduating
at
harvard
had
come
to
deerfield
when
it
was
still
suffering
under
the
ruinous
effects
of
king
philip
war
and
entered
on
his
ministry
with
a
salary
of
sixty
pounds
in
depreciated
new
england
currency
payable
not
in
money
but
in
wheat
and
pork
his
parishioners
built
him
a
house
he
married
and
had
now
eight
children
one
of
whom
was
absent
with
friends
at
hadley
his
next
neighbor
was
benoni
stebbins
sergeant
in
the
county
militia
who
lived
a
few
rods
from
the
about
fifty
yards
distant
and
near
the
northwest
angle
of
the
enclosure
stood
the
house
of
ensign
john
sheldon
a
framed
building
one
of
the
largest
in
the
village
and
like
that
of
stebbins
made
by
a
layer
of
bricks
between
the
outer
and
inner
sheathing
while
its
small
windows
and
its
projecting
upper
story
also
helped
to
make
it
defensible
the
space
enclosed
by
the
palisade
though
much
too
large
for
effective
defence
served
in
time
of
alarm
as
an
asylum
for
the
inhabitants
outside
whose
houses
were
scattered
some
on
the
north
towards
the
hidden
enemy
and
some
on
the
south
towards
hadley
and
hatfield
among
those
on
the
south
side
was
that
of
the
militia
captain
jonathan
wells
which
had
a
palisade
of
its
own
and
like
the
fort
served
as
an
asylum
for
the
neighbors
these
private
fortified
houses
were
sometimes
built
by
the
owners
alone
though
more
often
they
were
the
joint
work
of
the
owners
and
of
the
inhabitants
to
whose
safety
they
contributed
the
palisade
fence
that
enclosed
the
central
part
of
the
village
was
made
under
a
vote
of
the
town
each
inhabitant
being
required
to
do
his
share
and
as
they
were
greatly
impoverished
by
the
last
war
the
general
court
of
the
province
remitted
for
a
time
a
part
of
their
taxes
in
consideration
of
a
work
which
aided
the
general
defence
down
to
the
peace
of
ryswick
the
neighborhood
had
been
constantly
infested
by
and
once
the
village
had
been
attacked
by
a
considerable
force
of
french
and
indians
who
were
beaten
off
of
late
there
had
been
warnings
of
fresh
disturbance
lord
cornbury
governor
of
new
york
wrote
that
he
had
heard
through
spies
that
deerfield
was
again
to
be
attacked
and
a
message
to
the
same
effect
came
from
peter
schuyler
who
had
received
intimations
of
the
danger
from
mohawks
lately
on
a
visit
to
their
caughnawaga
relatives
during
the
autumn
the
alarm
was
so
great
that
the
people
took
refuge
within
the
palisades
and
the
houses
of
the
enclosure
were
crowded
with
them
but
the
panic
had
now
subsided
and
many
though
not
all
had
returned
to
their
homes
they
were
reassured
by
the
presence
of
twenty
volunteers
from
the
villages
below
whom
on
application
from
the
minister
williams
the
general
court
had
sent
as
a
garrison
to
deerfield
where
they
were
lodged
in
the
houses
of
the
villagers
on
the
night
when
hertel
de
rouville
and
his
band
lay
hidden
among
the
pines
there
were
in
all
the
settlement
a
little
less
than
three
hundred
souls
of
whom
two
hundred
and
were
inhabitants
twenty
were
yeomen
soldiers
of
the
garrison
two
were
visitors
from
hatfield
and
three
were
negro
slaves
they
were
of
all
ages
from
the
widow
allison
in
her
year
to
the
infant
son
of
deacon
french
aged
four
weeks
heavy
snows
had
lately
fallen
and
buried
the
clearings
the
meadow
and
the
frozen
river
to
the
depth
of
full
three
feet
on
the
northwestern
side
the
drifts
were
piled
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
palisade
fence
so
that
it
was
no
longer
an
obstruction
to
an
active
enemy
as
the
afternoon
waned
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
little
border
hamlet
were
no
doubt
like
those
of
any
other
rustic
new
england
village
at
the
end
of
a
winter
day
an
creaking
on
the
frosty
snow
as
it
brought
in
the
last
load
of
firewood

still

served

of
mush
and
milk
and
the
men
of
the
family
their
day
work
over
gathered
about
the
fire
while
perhaps
some
village
coquette
sat
in
the
corner
with
fingers
busy
at
the
and
ears
intent
on
the
stammered
wooings
of
her
rustic
lover
deerfield
kept
early
hours
and
it
is
likely
that
by
nine
all
were
in
their
beds
there
was
a
patrol
inside
the
palisade
but
there
was
little
discipline
among
these
extemporized
soldiers
the
watchers
grew
careless
as
the
frosty
night
went
on
and
it
is
said
that
towards
morning
they
like
the
villagers
betook
themselves
to
their
beds
rouville
and
his
men
savage
with
hunger
lay
shivering
under
the
pines
till
about
two
hours
before
dawn
then
leaving
their
packs
and
their
behind
they
moved
cautiously
towards
their
prey
there
was
a
crust
on
the
snow
strong
enough
to
bear
their
weight
though
not
to
prevent
a
rustling
noise
as
it
crunched
under
the
feet
of
so
many
men
it
is
said
that
from
time
to
time
rouville
commanded
a
halt
in
order
that
the
sentinels
if
such
there
were
might
mistake
the
distant
sound
for
rising
and
falling
gusts
of
wind
in
any
case
no
alarm
was
given
till
they
had
mounted
the
palisade
and
dropped
silently
into
the
unconscious
village
then
with
one
accord
they
screeched
the
and
assailed
the
doors
of
the
houses
with
axes
and
hatchets
the
hideous
din
startled
the
minister
williams
from
his
sleep
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
saw
dimly
a
crowd
of
savages
bursting
through
the
shattered
door
he
shouted
to
two
soldiers
who
were
lodged
in
the
house
and
then
with
more
valor
than
discretion
snatched
a
pistol
that
hung
at
the
head
of
the
bed
cocked
it
and
snapped
it
at
the
breast
of
the
foremost
indian
who
proved
to
be
a
caughnawaga
chief
it
missed
fire
or
williams
would
no
doubt
have
been
killed
on
the
spot
amid
the
screams
of
his
terrified
children
three
of
the
party
seized
him
and
bound
him
fast
for
they
came
well
provided
with
cords
since
prisoners
had
a
market
value
nevertheless
in
the
first
fury
of
their
attack
they
dragged
to
the
door
and
murdered
two
of
the
children
and
a
negro
woman
called
parthena
who
was
probably
their
nurse
in
an
upper
room
lodged
a
young
man
named
stoddard
who
had
time
to
snatch
a
cloak
throw
himself
out
of
the
window
climb
the
palisade
and
escape
in
the
darkness
as
he
was
he
made
his
way
over
the
snow
to
hatfield
binding
his
bare
feet
with
strips
torn
from
the
cloak
they
kept
williams
shivering
in
his
shirt
for
an
hour
while
a
frightful
uproar
of
yells
shrieks
and
gunshots
sounded
from
without
at
length
they
permitted
him
his
wife
and
five
remaining
children
to
dress
themselves
meanwhile
the
indians
and
their
allies
burst
into
most
of
the
houses
killed
such
of
the
men
as
resisted
butchered
some
of
the
women
and
children
and
seized
and
bound
the
rest
some
of
the
villagers
escaped
in
the
confusion
like
stoddard
and
either
fled
half
dead
with
cold
towards
hatfield
or
sought
refuge
in
the
fortified
house
of
jonathan
wells
the
house
of
stebbins
the
minister
next
neighbor
had
not
been
attacked
so
soon
as
the
rest
and
the
inmates
had
a
little
time
for
preparation
they
consisted
of
stebbins
himself
with
his
wife
and
five
children
david
hoyt
joseph
catlin
benjamin
church
a
namesake
of
the
old
indian
fighter
of
philip
war
and
three
other
men
probably
refugees
who
had
brought
their
wives
and
families
within
the
palisaded
enclosure
for
safety
thus
the
house
contained
seven
men
four
or
five
women
and
a
considerable
number
of
children
though
the
walls
were
it
was
not
built
for
defence
the
men
however
were
well
supplied
with
guns
powder
and
lead
and
they
seem
to
have
found
some
means
of
barricading
the
windows
when
the
enemy
tried
to
break
in
they
drove
them
back
with
loss
on
this
the
french
and
indians
gathered
in
great
numbers
before
the
house
showered
bullets
upon
it
and
tried
to
set
it
on
fire
they
were
again
repulsed
with
the
loss
of
several
killed
and
wounded
among
the
former
a
caughnawaga
chief
and
among
the
latter
a
french
officer
still
the
firing
continued
if
the
assailants
had
made
a
resolute
assault
the
defenders
must
have
been
overpowered
but
to
risk
lives
in
open
attack
was
contrary
to
every
maxim
of
forest
warfare
the
women
in
the
house
behaved
with
great
courage
and
moulded
bullets
which
the
men
shot
at
the
enemy
stebbins
was
killed
outright
and
church
was
wounded
as
was
also
the
wife
of
david
hoyt
at
length
most
of
the
french
and
indians
disgusted
with
the
obstinacy
of
the
defence
turned
their
attention
to
other
quarters
though
some
kept
up
their
fire
under
cover
of
the
and
another
building
within
easy
range
of
gunshot
this
building
was
the
house
of
ensign
john
sheldon
already
mentioned
the
indians
had
had
some
difficulty
in
mastering
it
for
the
door
being
of
thick
oak
plank
studded
with
nails
of
wrought
iron
and
well
barred
they
could
not
break
it
open
after
a
time
however
they
hacked
a
hole
in
it
through
which
they
fired
and
killed
sheldon
as
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
bed
in
a
lower
room
her
husband
a
man
of
great
resolution
seems
to
have
been
absent
their
son
john
with
hannah
his
wife
jumped
from
an
upper
chamber
window
the
young
woman
sprained
her
ankle
in
the
fall
and
lay
helpless
but
begged
her
husband
to
run
to
hatfield
for
aid
which
he
did
while
she
remained
a
prisoner
the
indians
soon
got
in
at
a
back
door
seized
mercy
sheldon
a
little
girl
of
two
years
and
dashed
out
her
brains
on
the
her
two
brothers
and
her
sister
mary
a
girl
of
sixteen
were
captured
the
house
was
used
for
a
short
time
as
a
depot
for
prisoners
and
here
also
was
brought
the
french
officer
wounded
in
the
attack
on
the
stebbins
house
a
family
tradition
relates
that
as
he
lay
in
great
torment
he
begged
for
water
and
that
it
was
brought
him
by
one
of
the
prisoners
john
catlin
whose
husband
son
and
infant
grandson
had
been
killed
and
who
nevertheless
did
all
in
her
power
to
relieve
the
sufferings
of
the
wounded
man
probably
it
was
in
recognition
of
this
charity
that
when
the
other
prisoners
were
led
away
catlin
was
left
behind
she
died
of
grief
a
few
weeks
later
the
sun
was
scarcely
an
hour
high
when
the
miserable
drove
of
captives
was
conducted
across
the
river
to
the
foot
of
a
mountain
or
high
hill
williams
and
his
family
were
soon
compelled
to
follow
and
his
house
was
set
on
fire
as
they
led
him
off
he
saw
that
other
houses
within
the
palisade
were
burning
and
that
all
were
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
except
that
of
his
neighbor
stebbins
where
the
gallant
defenders
still
kept
their
assailants
at
bay
having
collected
all
their
prisoners
the
main
body
of
the
french
and
indians
began
to
withdraw
towards
the
pine
forest
where
they
had
left
their
packs
and
and
to
prepare
for
a
retreat
before
the
country
should
be
roused
first
murdering
in
cold
blood
marah
carter
a
little
girl
of
five
years
whom
they
probably
thought
unequal
to
the
march
several
parties
however
still
lingered
in
the
village
firing
on
the
stebbins
house
killing
cattle
hogs
and
sheep
and
gathering
such
plunder
as
the
place
afforded
early
in
the
attack
and
while
it
was
yet
dark
the
light
of
burning
houses
reflected
from
the
fields
of
snow
had
been
seen
at
hatfield
hadley
and
northampton
the
alarm
was
sounded
through
the
slumbering
hamlets
and
parties
of
men
mounted
on
with
saddles
or
without
hastened
to
the
rescue
not
doubting
that
the
fires
were
kindled
by
indians
when
the
sun
was
about
two
hours
high
between
thirty
and
forty
of
them
were
gathered
at
the
fortified
house
of
jonathan
wells
at
the
southern
end
of
the
village
the
houses
of
this
neighborhood
were
still
standing
and
seem
not
to
have
been
attacked
the
stubborn
defence
of
the
stebbins
house
having
apparently
prevented
the
enemy
from
pushing
much
beyond
the
palisaded
enclosure
the
house
of
wells
was
full
of
refugee
families
a
few
deerfield
men
here
joined
the
horsemen
from
the
lower
towns
as
also
did
four
or
five
of
the
yeoman
soldiers
who
had
escaped
the
fate
of
most
of
their
comrades
the
horsemen
left
their
horses
within
wells
fence
he
himself
took
the
lead
and
the
whole
party
rushed
in
together
at
the
southern
gate
of
the
palisaded
enclosure
drove
out
the
plunderers
and
retook
a
part
of
their
plunder
the
assailants
of
the
stebbins
house
after
firing
at
it
for
three
hours
were
put
to
flight
and
those
of
its
male
occupants
who
were
still
alive
joined
their
countrymen
while
the
women
and
children
ran
back
for
harborage
to
the
house
of
wells
wells
and
his
men
now
upwards
of
fifty
drove
the
flying
enemy
more
than
a
mile
across
the
river
meadows
and
ran
in
headlong
pursuit
over
the
crusted
snow
killing
a
considerable
number
in
the
eagerness
of
the
chase
many
threw
off
their
overcoats
and
even
their
jackets
wells
saw
the
danger
and
vainly
called
on
them
to
stop
their
blood
was
up
and
most
of
them
were
young
and
inexperienced
meanwhile
the
firing
at
the
village
had
been
heard
by
rouville
main
body
who
had
already
begun
their
retreat
northward
they
turned
back
to
support
their
comrades
and
hid
themselves
under
the
bank
of
the
river
till
the
pursuers
drew
near
when
they
gave
them
a
close
volley
and
rushed
upon
them
with
the
some
of
the
english
were
shot
down
and
the
rest
driven
back
there
was
no
panic
we
retreated
says
wells
facing
about
and
firing
when
they
reached
the
palisade
they
made
a
final
stand
covering
by
their
fire
such
of
their
comrades
as
had
fallen
within
range
of
and
thus
saving
them
from
the
the
french
did
not
try
to
dislodge
them
nine
of
them
had
been
killed
several
were
wounded
and
one
was
captured
the
number
of
english
carried
off
prisoners
was
one
hundred
and
eleven
and
the
number
killed
was
according
to
one
list
and
according
to
another
the
latter
including
some
who
were
smothered
in
the
cellars
of
their
burning
houses
the
names
and
in
most
cases
the
ages
of
both
captives
and
slain
are
preserved
those
who
escaped
with
life
and
freedom
were
by
the
best
account
one
hundred
and
an
official
tabular
statement
drawn
up
on
the
spot
sets
the
number
of
houses
burned
at
seventeen
the
house
of
the
town
clerk
thomas
french
escaped
as
before
mentioned
and
the
town
records
with
other
papers
in
his
charge
were
saved
the
also
was
left
standing
the
house
of
sheldon
was
hastily
set
on
fire
by
the
french
and
indians
when
their
rear
was
driven
out
of
the
village
by
wells
and
his
men
but
the
fire
was
extinguished
and
the
old
indian
house
as
it
was
called
stood
till
the
year
its
door
deeply
scarred
with
hatchets
and
with
a
hole
cut
near
the
middle
is
still
preserved
in
the
memorial
hall
at
deerfield
vaudreuil
wrote
to
the
minister
ponchartrain
that
the
french
lost
two
or
three
killed
and
twenty
or
wounded
rouville
himself
being
among
the
latter
this
can
not
include
the
indians
since
there
is
proof
that
the
enemy
left
behind
a
considerable
number
of
their
dead
wherever
resistance
was
possible
it
had
been
of
the
most
prompt
and
determined
character
long
before
noon
the
french
and
indians
were
on
their
northward
march
with
their
train
of
captives
more
armed
men
came
up
from
the
settlements
below
and
by
midnight
about
eighty
were
gathered
at
the
ruined
village
couriers
had
been
sent
to
rouse
the
country
and
before
evening
of
the
next
day
the
first
of
march
the
force
at
deerfield
was
increased
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
but
a
thaw
and
a
warm
rain
had
set
in
and
as
few
of
the
men
had
pursuit
was
out
of
the
question
even
could
the
agile
savages
and
their
allies
have
been
overtaken
the
probable
consequence
would
have
been
the
murdering
of
the
captives
to
prevent
their
escape
in
spite
of
the
foul
blow
dealt
upon
it
deerfield
was
not
abandoned
such
of
its
men
as
were
left
were
taken
as
soldiers
into
the
pay
of
the
province
while
the
women
and
children
were
sent
to
the
villages
below
a
small
garrison
was
also
stationed
at
the
spot
under
command
of
captain
jonathan
wells
and
thus
the
village
held
its
ground
till
the
storm
of
war
should
pass
over
we
have
seen
that
the
minister
williams
with
his
wife
and
family
were
led
from
their
burning
house
across
the
river
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
the
crowd
of
terrified
and
disconsolate
captives
friends
neighbors
and
relatives
were
already
gathered
here
they
presently
saw
the
fight
in
the
meadow
and
were
told
that
if
their
countrymen
attempted
a
rescue
they
should
all
be
put
to
death
after
this
writes
williams
we
went
up
the
mountain
and
saw
the
smoke
of
the
fires
in
town
and
beheld
the
awful
desolation
of
deerfield
and
before
we
marched
any
farther
they
killed
a
sucking
child
of
the
english
the
french
and
indians
marched
that
afternoon
only
four
or
five
miles
to
greenfield
meadows
where
they
stopped
to
encamp
dug
away
the
snow
laid
on
the
ground
for
beds
and
bound
fast
such
of
the
prisoners
as
seemed
able
to
escape
the
indians
then
held
a
carousal
on
some
liquor
they
had
found
in
the
village
and
in
their
drunken
rage
murdered
a
negro
man
belonging
to
williams
in
spite
of
their
precautions
joseph
alexander
one
of
the
prisoners
escaped
during
the
night
at
which
they
were
greatly
incensed
and
rouville
ordered
williams
to
tell
his
companions
in
misfortune
that
if
any
more
of
them
ran
off
the
rest
should
be
burned
alive
the
prisoners
were
the
property
of
those
who
had
taken
them
williams
had
two
masters
one
of
the
three
who
had
seized
him
having
been
shot
in
the
attack
on
the
house
of
stebbins
his
principal
owner
was
a
surly
fellow
who
would
not
let
him
speak
to
the
other
prisoners
but
as
he
was
presently
chosen
to
guard
the
rear
the
minister
was
left
in
the
hands
of
his
other
master
who
allowed
him
to
walk
beside
his
wife
and
help
her
on
the
way
having
borne
a
child
a
few
weeks
before
she
was
in
no
condition
for
such
a
march
and
felt
that
her
hour
was
near
williams
speaks
of
her
in
the
strongest
terms
of
affection
she
made
no
complaint
and
accepted
her
fate
with
resignation
we
discoursed
he
says
of
the
happiness
of
those
who
had
god
for
a
father
and
friend
as
also
that
it
was
our
reasonable
duty
quietly
to
submit
to
his
will
her
thoughts
were
for
her
remaining
children
whom
she
commended
to
her
husband
care
their
intercourse
was
short
the
indian
who
had
gone
to
the
rear
of
the
train
soon
returned
separated
them
ordered
williams
to
the
front
and
so
made
me
take
a
last
farewell
of
my
dear
wife
the
desire
of
my
eyes
and
companion
in
many
mercies
and
afflictions
they
came
soon
after
to
green
river
a
stream
then
about
and
so
swift
that
the
water
had
not
frozen
after
wading
it
with
difficulty
they
climbed
a
hill
beyond
the
minister
with
strength
almost
spent
was
permitted
to
rest
a
few
moments
at
the
top
and
as
the
other
prisoners
passed
by
in
turn
he
questioned
each
for
news
of
his
wife
he
was
not
left
long
in
suspense
she
had
fallen
from
weakness
in
fording
the
stream
but
gained
her
feet
again
and
drenched
in
the
icy
current
struggled
to
the
farther
bank
when
the
savage
who
owned
her
finding
that
she
could
not
climb
the
hill
killed
her
with
one
stroke
of
his
hatchet
her
body
was
left
on
the
snow
till
a
few
of
her
townsmen
who
had
followed
the
trail
found
it
a
day
or
two
after
carried
it
back
to
deerfield
and
buried
it
in
the
churchyard
illustration
return
from
drawn
by
howard
pyle
on
the
next
day
the
indians
killed
an
infant
and
a
little
girl
of
eleven
years
on
the
day
following
friday
they
tomahawked
a
woman
and
on
saturday
four
others
this
apparent
cruelty
was
in
fact
a
kind
of
mercy
the
victims
could
not
keep
up
with
the
party
and
the
saved
them
from
a
lonely
and
lingering
death
from
cold
and
starvation
some
of
the
children
when
spent
with
the
march
were
carried
on
the
backs
of
their
owners
partly
perhaps
through
kindness
and
partly
because
every
child
had
its
price
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
march
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
west
river
which
enters
the
connecticut
a
little
above
the
present
town
of
brattleboro
some
of
the
indians
were
discontented
with
the
distribution
of
the
captives
alleging
that
others
had
got
more
than
their
share
on
which
the
whole
troop
were
mustered
together
and
some
changes
of
ownership
were
agreed
upon
at
this
place
and
sledges
had
been
left
and
these
served
to
carry
their
wounded
as
well
as
some
of
the
captive
children
williams
was
stripped
of
the
better
part
of
his
clothes
and
others
given
him
instead
so
full
of
vermin
that
they
were
a
torment
to
him
through
all
the
journey
the
march
now
continued
with
pitiless
speed
up
the
frozen
connecticut
where
the
recent
thaw
had
covered
the
ice
with
slush
and
water
on
sunday
they
made
a
halt
and
the
minister
was
permitted
to
preach
a
sermon
from
the
text
hear
all
people
and
behold
my
sorrow
my
virgins
and
my
young
men
are
gone
into
captivity
then
amid
the
ice
the
snow
the
forest
and
the
savages
his
forlorn
flock
joined
their
voices
in
a
psalm
on
monday
guns
were
heard
from
the
rear
and
the
indians
and
their
allies
in
great
alarm
bound
their
prisoners
fast
and
prepared
for
battle
it
proved
however
that
the
guns
had
been
fired
at
wild
geese
by
some
of
their
own
number
on
which
they
recovered
their
spirits
fired
a
volley
for
joy
and
boasted
that
the
english
could
not
overtake
them
more
women
fainted
by
the
way
and
died
under
the
hatchet
some
with
pious
resignation
some
with
despairing
apathy
some
with
a
desperate
joy
two
hundred
miles
of
wilderness
still
lay
between
them
and
the
canadian
settlements
it
was
a
waste
without
a
house
or
even
a
wigwam
except
here
and
there
the
bark
shed
of
some
savage
hunter
at
the
mouth
of
white
river
the
party
divided
into
small
bands
no
doubt
in
order
to
subsist
by
hunting
for
provisions
were
fast
failing
the
williams
family
were
separated
stephen
was
carried
up
the
connecticut
samuel
and
eunice
with
two
younger
children
were
carried
off
in
various
directions
while
the
wretched
father
along
with
two
small
children
of
one
of
his
parishioners
was
compelled
to
follow
his
indian
masters
up
the
valley
of
white
river
one
of
the
children
a
little
girl
was
killed
on
the
next
morning
by
her
caughnawaga
owner
who
was
unable
to
carry
her
on
the
next
sunday
the
minister
was
left
in
camp
with
one
indian
and
the
surviving
child
a
boy
of
nine
while
the
rest
of
the
party
were
hunting
my
spirit
he
says
was
almost
overwhelmed
within
me
but
he
found
comfort
in
the
text
leave
thy
fatherless
children
i
will
preserve
them
alive
nor
was
his
hope
deceived
his
youngest
surviving
child
a
boy
of
four
though
harshly
treated
by
his
owners
was
carried
on
their
shoulders
or
dragged
on
a
sledge
to
the
end
of
the
journey
his
youngest
daughter
seven
years
old
was
treated
with
great
kindness
throughout
samuel
and
eunice
suffered
much
from
hunger
but
were
dragged
on
sledges
when
too
faint
to
walk
stephen
nearly
starved
to
death
but
after
eight
months
in
the
forest
he
safely
reached
chambly
with
his
indian
masters
of
the
whole
band
of
captives
only
about
half
ever
again
saw
friends
and
home
seventeen
broke
down
on
the
way
and
were
killed
while
david
hoyt
and
jacob
hix
died
of
starvation
at
coos
meadows
on
the
upper
connecticut
during
the
entire
march
no
woman
seems
to
have
been
subjected
to
violence
and
this
holds
true
with
rare
exceptions
in
all
the
indian
wars
of
new
england
this
remarkable
forbearance
towards
female
prisoners
so
different
from
the
practice
of
many
western
tribes
was
probably
due
to
a
form
of
superstition
aided
perhaps
by
the
influence
of
the
missionaries
it
is
to
be
observed
however
that
the
heathen
savages
of
king
philip
war
who
had
never
seen
a
jesuit
were
no
less
forbearing
in
this
respect
the
hunters
of
williams
party
killed
five
moose
the
flesh
of
which
smoked
and
dried
was
carried
on
their
backs
and
that
of
the
prisoner
whom
they
had
provided
with
thus
burdened
the
minister
toiled
on
following
his
masters
along
the
frozen
current
of
white
river
till
crossing
the
snowy
backs
of
the
green
mountains
they
struck
the
headwaters
of
the
stream
then
called
french
river
now
the
winooski
or
onion
being
in
great
fear
of
a
thaw
they
pushed
on
with
double
speed
williams
was
not
used
to
and
they
gave
him
those
painful
cramps
of
the
legs
and
ankles
called
in
canada
à
la
one
morning
at
dawn
he
was
waked
by
his
chief
master
and
ordered
to
get
up
say
his
prayers
and
eat
his
breakfast
for
they
must
make
a
long
march
that
day
the
minister
was
in
despair
after
prayer
he
says
i
arose
from
my
knees
but
my
feet
were
so
tender
swollen
bruised
and
full
of
pain
that
i
could
scarce
stand
upon
them
without
holding
on
the
wigwam
and
when
the
indians
said
must
run
i
answered
i
could
not
run
my
master
pointing
to
his
hatchet
said
to
me
i
must
dash
out
your
brains
and
take
your
scalp
the
indian
proved
better
than
his
word
and
williams
was
suffered
to
struggle
on
as
he
could
god
wonderfully
supported
me
he
writes
and
my
strength
was
restored
and
renewed
to
admiration
he
thinks
that
he
walked
that
day
forty
miles
on
the
snow
following
the
winooski
to
its
mouth
the
party
reached
lake
champlain
a
little
north
of
the
present
city
of
burlington
here
the
swollen
feet
of
the
prisoner
were
tortured
by
the
rough
ice
till
snow
began
to
fall
and
cover
it
with
a
soft
carpet
bending
under
his
load
and
powdered
by
the
falling
flakes
he
toiled
on
till
at
noon
of
a
saturday
lean
tired
and
ragged
he
and
his
masters
reached
the
french
outpost
of
chambly
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
from
montreal
here
the
unhappy
wayfarer
was
treated
with
great
kindness
both
by
the
officers
of
the
fort
and
by
the
inhabitants
one
of
the
chief
among
whom
lodged
him
in
his
house
and
welcomed
him
to
his
table
after
a
short
stay
at
chambly
williams
and
his
masters
set
out
in
a
canoe
for
sorel
on
the
way
a
frenchwoman
came
down
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
invited
the
party
to
her
house
telling
the
minister
that
she
herself
had
once
been
a
prisoner
among
the
indians
and
knew
how
to
feel
for
him
she
seated
him
at
a
table
spread
a
and
placed
food
before
him
while
the
indians
to
their
great
indignation
were
supplied
with
a
meal
in
the
similar
kindness
was
shown
by
the
inhabitants
along
the
way
till
the
party
reached
their
destination
the
abenaki
village
of
francis
to
which
his
masters
belonged
here
there
was
a
fort
in
which
lived
two
jesuits
directors
of
the
mission
and
here
williams
found
several
english
children
captured
the
summer
before
during
the
raid
on
the
settlements
of
maine
and
already
transformed
into
little
indians
both
in
dress
and
behavior
at
the
gate
of
the
fort
one
of
the
jesuits
met
him
and
asked
him
to
go
into
the
church
and
give
thanks
to
god
for
sparing
his
life
to
which
he
replied
that
he
would
give
thanks
in
some
other
place
the
priest
then
commanded
him
to
go
which
he
refused
to
do
when
on
the
next
day
the
bell
rang
for
mass
one
of
his
indian
masters
seized
him
and
dragged
him
into
the
church
where
he
got
behind
the
door
and
watched
the
service
from
his
retreat
with
extreme
disapprobation
one
of
the
jesuits
telling
him
that
he
would
go
to
hell
for
not
accepting
the
apostolic
traditions
and
trusting
only
in
the
bible
he
replied
that
he
was
glad
to
know
that
christ
was
to
be
his
judge
and
not
they
his
chief
master
who
was
a
zealot
in
his
way
and
as
much
bound
to
the
rites
and
forms
of
the
church
as
he
had
been
before
his
conversion
to
his
medicines
or
practices
of
heathen
superstition
one
day
ordered
him
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
on
his
refusal
tried
to
force
him
but
as
the
minister
was
tough
and
muscular
the
indian
could
not
guide
his
hand
then
pulling
out
a
crucifix
that
hung
at
his
neck
he
told
williams
in
broken
english
to
kiss
it
and
being
again
refused
he
brandished
his
hatchet
over
him
and
threatened
to
knock
out
his
brains
this
failing
of
the
desired
effect
he
threw
down
the
hatchet
and
said
he
would
first
bite
out
the
minister
a
form
of
torture
then
in
vogue
among
the
northern
indians
both
converts
and
heathen
williams
offered
him
a
hand
and
invited
him
to
begin
on
which
he
gave
the
a
gripe
with
his
teeth
and
then
let
it
go
saying
no
good
minister
bad
as
the
devil
the
failure
seems
to
have
discouraged
him
for
he
made
no
further
attempt
to
convert
the
intractable
heretic
the
direct
and
simple
narrative
of
williams
is
plainly
the
work
of
an
honest
and
courageous
man
he
was
the
most
important
capture
of
the
year
and
the
governor
hearing
that
he
was
at
francis
despatched
a
canoe
to
request
the
jesuits
of
the
mission
to
send
him
to
montreal
thither
therefore
his
masters
carried
him
expecting
no
doubt
a
good
price
for
their
prisoner
vaudreuil
in
fact
bought
him
exchanged
his
tattered
clothes
for
good
ones
lodged
him
in
his
house
and
in
the
words
of
williams
was
in
all
respects
relating
to
my
outward
man
courteous
and
charitable
to
admiration
he
sent
for
two
of
the
minister
children
who
were
in
the
town
bought
his
eldest
daughter
from
the
indians
and
promised
to
do
what
he
could
to
get
the
others
out
of
their
hands
his
youngest
son
was
bought
by
a
lady
of
the
place
and
his
eldest
by
a
merchant
his
youngest
daughter
eunice
then
seven
or
eight
years
old
was
at
the
mission
of
louis
or
caughnawaga
vaudreuil
sent
a
priest
to
conduct
williams
thither
and
try
to
ransom
the
child
but
the
jesuits
of
the
mission
flatly
refused
to
let
him
speak
to
or
see
her
williams
says
that
vaudreuil
was
very
angry
at
hearing
of
this
and
a
few
days
after
he
went
himself
to
caughnawaga
with
the
minister
this
time
the
jesuits
whose
authority
within
their
mission
seemed
almost
to
override
that
of
the
governor
himself
yielded
so
far
as
to
permit
the
father
to
see
his
child
on
condition
that
he
spoke
to
no
other
english
prisoner
he
talked
with
her
for
an
hour
exhorting
her
never
to
forget
her
catechism
which
she
had
learned
by
rote
vaudreuil
and
his
wife
afterwards
did
all
in
their
power
to
procure
her
ransom
but
the
indians
or
the
missionaries
in
their
name
would
not
let
her
go
she
is
there
still
writes
williams
two
years
later
and
has
forgotten
to
speak
english
what
grieved
him
still
more
eunice
had
forgotten
her
catechism
while
he
was
at
montreal
his
movements
were
continually
watched
lest
he
should
speak
to
other
prisoners
and
prevent
their
conversion
he
thinks
these
precautions
were
due
to
the
priests
whose
constant
endeavor
it
was
to
turn
the
captives
or
at
least
the
younger
and
more
manageable
among
them
into
catholics
and
canadians
the
kindness
towards
him
never
failed
though
he
told
him
that
he
should
not
be
set
free
till
the
english
gave
up
one
captain
baptiste
a
noted
whom
they
had
captured
some
time
before
he
was
soon
after
sent
down
the
river
to
quebec
along
with
the
superior
of
the
jesuits
here
he
lodged
seven
weeks
with
a
member
of
the
council
who
treated
him
kindly
but
told
him
that
if
he
did
not
avoid
intercourse
with
the
other
english
prisoners
he
would
be
sent
farther
away
he
saw
much
of
the
jesuits
who
courteously
asked
him
to
dine
though
he
says
that
one
of
them
afterwards
made
some
latin
verses
about
him
in
which
he
was
likened
to
a
captive
wolf
another
jesuit
told
him
that
when
the
mission
indians
set
out
on
their
raid
against
deerfield
he
charged
them
to
baptize
all
children
before
killing
them
such
he
said
was
his
desire
for
the
salvation
even
of
his
enemies
to
murdering
the
children
after
they
were
baptized
he
appears
to
have
made
no
objection
williams
says
that
in
their
dread
lest
he
should
prevent
the
conversion
of
the
other
prisoners
the
missionaries
promised
him
a
pension
from
the
king
and
free
intercourse
with
his
children
and
neighbors
if
he
would
embrace
the
catholic
faith
and
remain
in
canada
to
which
he
answered
that
he
would
do
so
without
reward
if
he
thought
their
religion
was
true
but
as
he
believed
the
contrary
the
offer
of
the
whole
world
would
tempt
him
no
more
than
a
blackberry
to
prevent
him
more
effectually
from
perverting
the
minds
of
his
captive
countrymen
and
fortifying
them
in
their
heresy
he
was
sent
to
château
richer
a
little
below
quebec
and
lodged
with
the
parish
priest
who
was
very
kind
to
him
i
am
persuaded
he
writes
that
he
abhorred
their
sending
down
the
heathen
to
commit
outrages
against
the
english
saying
it
is
more
like
committing
murders
than
carrying
on
war
he
was
sorely
tried
by
the
incessant
efforts
to
convert
the
prisoners
sometimes
they
would
tell
me
my
children
sometimes
my
neighbors
were
turned
to
be
of
their
religion
some
made
it
their
work
to
allure
poor
souls
by
flatteries
and
great
promises
some
threatened
some
offered
abuse
to
such
as
refused
to
go
to
church
and
be
present
at
mass
and
some
they
industriously
contrived
to
get
married
among
them
i
understood
they
would
tell
the
english
that
i
was
turned
that
they
might
gain
them
to
change
their
religion
these
their
endeavors
to
seduce
to
popery
were
very
exercising
to
me
after
a
time
he
was
permitted
to
return
to
quebec
where
he
met
an
english
franciscan
who
he
says
had
been
sent
from
france
to
aid
in
converting
the
prisoners
lest
the
minister
should
counteract
the
efforts
of
the
friar
the
priests
had
him
sent
back
to
château
richer
but
he
observes
god
showed
his
dislike
of
such
a
persecuting
spirit
for
the
very
next
day
the
seminary
a
very
famous
building
was
most
of
it
burnt
down
by
a
joiner
letting
a
coal
of
fire
drop
among
the
shavings
the
heaviest
of
all
his
tribulations
now
fell
upon
him
his
son
samuel
about
sixteen
years
old
had
been
kept
at
montreal
under
the
tutelage
of
father
meriel
a
priest
of
sulpice
the
boy
afterwards
declared
that
he
was
promised
great
rewards
if
he
would
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
severe
punishment
if
he
would
not
proving
obstinate
he
was
whipped
till
at
last
he
made
the
sign
after
which
he
was
told
to
go
to
mass
and
on
his
refusal
four
stout
boys
of
the
school
were
ordered
to
drag
him
in
williams
presently
received
a
letter
in
samuel
handwriting
though
dictated
as
the
father
believed
by
his
priestly
tutors
in
this
was
recounted
with
many
edifying
particulars
the
deathbed
conversion
of
two
new
england
women
and
to
the
minister
unspeakable
grief
and
horror
the
messenger
who
brought
the
letter
told
him
that
the
boy
himself
had
turned
catholic
i
have
heard
the
news
he
wrote
to
his
recreant
son
with
the
most
distressing
afflicting
sorrowful
spirit
oh
i
pity
you
i
mourn
over
you
day
and
night
oh
i
pity
your
weakness
that
through
the
craftiness
of
man
you
are
turned
from
the
simplicity
of
the
gospel
though
his
correspondence
was
strictly
watched
he
managed
to
convey
to
the
boy
a
long
exposition
from
his
own
pen
of
the
infallible
truth
of
calvinistic
orthodoxy
and
the
damnable
errors
of
rome
this
or
something
else
had
its
effect
samuel
returned
to
the
creed
of
his
fathers
and
being
at
last
exchanged
went
home
to
deerfield
where
he
was
chosen
in
and
where
he
soon
after
died
williams
gives
many
particulars
of
the
efforts
of
the
priests
to
convert
the
prisoners
and
his
account
like
the
rest
of
his
story
bears
the
marks
of
truth
there
was
a
treble
motive
for
conversion
it
recruited
the
church
weakened
the
enemy
and
strengthened
canada
since
few
of
the
converts
would
peril
their
souls
by
returning
to
their
heretic
relatives
the
means
of
conversion
varied
they
were
gentle
when
gentleness
seemed
likely
to
answer
the
purpose
little
girls
and
young
women
were
placed
in
convents
where
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
they
were
treated
with
the
most
tender
kindness
by
the
sisterhood
who
fully
believed
that
to
gain
them
to
the
faith
was
to
snatch
them
from
perdition
but
when
they
or
their
brothers
proved
obdurate
different
means
were
used
threats
of
hell
were
varied
by
threats
of
a
whipping
which
according
to
williams
were
often
put
into
execution
parents
were
rigorously
severed
from
their
families
though
one
lalande
who
had
been
sent
to
watch
the
elder
prisoners
reported
that
they
would
persist
in
trying
to
see
their
children
till
some
of
them
were
killed
in
the
attempt
here
writes
williams
might
be
a
history
in
itself
of
the
trials
and
sufferings
of
many
of
our
children
who
after
separation
from
grown
persons
have
been
made
to
do
as
they
would
have
them
i
mourned
when
i
thought
with
myself
that
i
had
one
child
with
the
maquas
caughnawagas
a
second
turned
papist
and
a
little
child
of
six
years
of
age
in
danger
to
be
instructed
in
popery
and
knew
full
well
that
all
endeavors
would
be
used
to
prevent
my
seeing
or
speaking
with
them
he
also
says
that
he
and
others
were
told
that
if
they
would
turn
catholic
their
children
should
be
restored
to
them
and
among
other
devices
some
of
his
parishioners
were
assured
that
their
pastor
himself
had
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
and
bowed
in
submission
to
holy
church
in
midwinter
not
quite
a
year
after
their
capture
the
prisoners
were
visited
by
a
gleam
of
hope
john
sheldon
accompanied
by
young
john
wells
of
deerfield
and
captain
livingston
of
albany
came
to
montreal
with
letters
from
governor
dudley
proposing
an
exchange
sheldon
wife
and
infant
child
his
and
his
had
been
killed
four
of
his
children
with
his
hannah
the
same
who
had
sprained
her
ankle
in
leaping
from
her
chamber
window
besides
others
of
his
near
relatives
and
connections
were
prisoners
in
canada
and
so
also
was
the
mother
of
young
wells
in
the
last
december
sheldon
and
wells
had
gone
to
boston
and
begged
to
be
sent
as
envoys
to
the
french
governor
the
petition
was
readily
granted
and
livingston
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
town
was
engaged
to
accompany
them
after
a
journey
of
extreme
hardship
they
reached
their
destination
and
were
received
with
courtesy
by
vaudreuil
but
difficulties
arose
the
french
and
above
all
the
clergy
were
unwilling
to
part
with
captives
many
of
whom
they
hoped
to
transform
into
canadians
by
conversion
and
adoption
many
also
were
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
who
demanded
payment
for
them
which
dudley
had
always
refused
declaring
that
he
would
not
set
up
an
algiers
trade
by
buying
them
from
their
pretended
owners
and
he
wrote
to
vaudreuil
that
for
his
own
part
he
would
never
permit
a
savage
to
tell
him
that
any
christian
prisoner
was
at
his
disposal
vaudreuil
had
insisted
that
his
indians
could
not
be
compelled
to
give
up
their
captives
since
they
were
not
subjects
of
france
but
only
allies
which
so
far
as
concerned
the
mission
indians
within
the
colony
was
but
a
pretext
it
is
true
however
that
the
french
authorities
were
in
such
fear
of
offending
even
these
that
they
rarely
ventured
to
cross
their
interests
or
their
passions
other
difficulties
were
raised
and
though
the
envoys
remained
in
canada
till
late
in
spring
they
accomplished
little
at
last
probably
to
get
rid
of
their
importunities
five
prisoners
were
given
up
to
them
sheldon
hannah
esther
williams
eldest
daughter
of
the
minister
a
certain
ebenezer
carter
and
two
others
unknown
with
these
sheldon
and
his
companions
set
out
in
may
on
their
return
and
soon
after
they
were
gone
four
young
men
baker
nims
kellogg
and
petty
desperate
at
being
left
in
captivity
made
their
escape
from
montreal
and
reached
deerfield
before
the
end
of
june
half
dead
with
hunger
sheldon
and
his
party
were
escorted
homeward
by
eight
soldiers
under
courtemanche
an
officer
of
distinction
whose
orders
were
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
country
he
fell
ill
at
boston
where
he
was
treated
with
much
kindness
and
on
his
recovery
was
sent
home
by
sea
along
with
captain
vetch
and
samuel
hill
charged
to
open
a
fresh
negotiation
with
these
at
the
request
of
courtemanche
went
young
william
dudley
son
of
the
governor
they
were
received
at
quebec
with
a
courtesy
qualified
by
extreme
caution
lest
they
should
spy
out
the
secrets
of
the
land
the
mission
was
not
very
successful
though
the
elder
dudley
had
now
a
good
number
of
french
prisoners
in
his
hands
captured
in
acadia
or
on
the
adjacent
seas
a
few
only
of
the
english
were
released
including
the
boy
stephen
williams
whom
vaudreuil
had
bought
for
forty
crowns
from
his
indian
master
in
the
following
winter
john
sheldon
made
another
journey
on
foot
to
canada
with
larger
powers
than
before
he
arrived
in
march
and
returned
with
of
his
released
countrymen
who
says
williams
were
chiefly
adults
permitted
to
go
because
there
was
no
hope
of
converting
them
the
english
governor
had
by
this
time
seen
the
necessity
of
greater
concessions
and
had
even
consented
to
release
the
noted
captain
baptiste
whom
the
boston
merchants
regarded
as
a
pirate
in
the
same
summer
samuel
appleton
and
john
bonner
in
the
brigantine
hope
brought
a
considerable
number
of
french
prisoners
to
quebec
and
returned
to
boston
at
the
end
of
october
with
english
of
all
ages
for
three
at
least
of
this
number
money
was
paid
by
the
english
probably
on
account
of
prisoners
bought
by
frenchmen
from
the
indians
the
minister
williams
was
exchanged
for
baptiste
the
pirate
and
two
of
his
children
were
also
redeemed
though
the
caughnawagas
or
their
missionaries
refused
to
part
with
his
daughter
eunice
williams
says
that
the
priests
made
great
efforts
to
induce
the
prisoners
to
remain
in
canada
tempting
some
with
the
prospect
of
pensions
from
the
king
and
frightening
others
with
promises
of
damnation
joined
with
predictions
of
shipwreck
on
the
way
home
he
thinks
that
about
one
hundred
were
left
in
canada
many
of
whom
were
children
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
who
could
easily
hide
them
in
the
woods
and
who
were
known
in
some
cases
to
have
done
so
seven
more
were
redeemed
in
the
following
year
by
the
indefatigable
sheldon
on
a
third
visit
to
canada
the
exchanged
prisoners
had
been
captured
at
various
times
and
places
those
from
deerfield
amounted
in
all
to
about
sixty
or
a
little
more
than
half
the
whole
number
carried
off
most
of
the
others
were
dead
or
converted
some
married
canadians
and
others
their
the
history
of
some
of
them
can
be
traced
with
certainty
thus
thomas
french
blacksmith
and
town
clerk
of
deerfield
and
deacon
of
the
church
was
captured
with
his
wife
and
six
children
his
wife
and
infant
child
were
killed
on
the
way
to
canada
he
and
his
two
eldest
children
were
exchanged
and
brought
home
his
daughter
freedom
was
converted
baptized
under
the
name
of
marie
françoise
and
married
to
jean
daulnay
a
canadian
his
daughter
martha
was
baptized
as
marguerite
and
married
to
jacques
roy
on
whose
death
she
married
jean
louis
ménard
by
whom
she
became
ancestress
of
joseph
plessis
eleventh
bishop
of

elizabeth
corse
eight
years

when
captured
was
baptized
under

lived
many
years
at

the

had
been
murdered
on
the
deerfield
meadows
was
baptized
as
marie
jeanne
joanna
kellogg
eleven
years
old
when
taken
married
a
caughnawaga
chief
and
became
at
all
points
an
indian
squaw
she
was
not
alone
in
this
strange
transformation
eunice
williams
the
namesake
of
her
slaughtered
mother
remained
in
the
wigwams
of
the
caughnawagas
forgot
as
we
have
seen
her
english
and
her
catechism
was
baptized
and
in
due
time
married
to
an
indian
of
the
tribe
who
thenceforward
called
himself
williams
thus
her
hybrid
children
bore
her
family
name
her
father
who
returned
to
his
parish
at
deerfield
and
her
brother
stephen
who
became
a
minister
like
his
parent
never
ceased
to
pray
for
her
return
to
her
country
and
her
faith
many
years
after
in
she
came
with
her
husband
to
visit
her
relatives
in
deerfield
dressed
as
a
squaw
and
wrapped
in
an
indian
blanket
nothing
would
induce
her
to
stay
though
she
was
persuaded
on
one
occasion
to
put
on
a
civilized
dress
and
go
to
church
after
which
she
impatiently
discarded
her
gown
and
resumed
her
blanket
as
she
was
kindly
treated
by
her
relatives
and
as
no
attempt
was
made
to
detain
her
against
her
will
she
came
again
in
the
next
year
bringing
two
of
her
children
and
twice
afterwards
repeated
the
visit
she
and
her
husband
were
offered
a
tract
of
land
if
they
would
settle
in
new
england
but
she
positively
refused
saying
that
it
would
endanger
her
soul
she
lived
to
a
great
age
a
squaw
to
the
last
one
of
her
grandsons
eleazer
williams
turned
protestant
was
educated
at
dartmouth
college
at
the
charge
of
friends
in
new
england
and
was
for
a
time
missionary
to
the
indians
of
green
bay
in
wisconsin
his
character
for
veracity
was
not
of
the
best
he
deceived
the
excellent
antiquarian
hoyt
by
various
inventions
touching
the
attack
on
deerfield
and
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
tried
to
pass
himself
off
as
the
lost
dauphin
son
of
louis
xvi
here
it
may
be
observed
that
the
descendants
of
young
captives
brought
into
canada
by
the
mission
indians
during
the
various
wars
with
the
english
colonies
became
a
considerable
element
in
the
canadian
population
perhaps
the
most
prominent
example
is
that
of
the
gill
family
in
june
a
boy
named
samuel
gill
then
in
his
tenth
year
was
captured
by
the
abenakis
at
salisbury
in
massachusetts
carried
to
francis
and
converted
some
years
later
he
married
a
young
english
girl
said
to
have
been
named
james
and
to
have
been
captured
at
kennebunk
in
the
late
abbé
maurault
missionary
at
francis
computed
their
descendants
at
nine
hundred
and
in
whose
veins
french
english
and
abenaki
blood
were
mixed
in
every
conceivable
proportion
he
gives
the
tables
of
genealogy
in
full
and
says
that
two
hundred
and
thirteen
of
this
prolific
race
still
bear
the
surname
of
gill
if
concludes
the
worthy
priest
one
should
trace
out
all
the
english
families
brought
into
canada
by
the
abenakis
one
would
be
astonished
at
the
number
of
persons
who
are
indebted
to
these
savages
for
the
blessing
of
being
catholics
and
the
advantage
of
being
canadians
an
advantage
for
which
are
so
ungrateful
that
they
migrate

french
writers
say
that

killed

of

thereupon
asked

i
remember
to
have
seen
eleazer
williams
at
my
father
house
in
boston
when
a
boy
my
impression
of
him
is
that
of
a
and
somewhat
portly
man
showing
little
trace
of
indian
blood
and
whose
features
i
was
told
resembled
those
of
the
bourbons
probably
this
likeness
real
or
imagined
suggested
the
imposition
he
was
practising
at
the
time
the
story
of
the
bell
of
regis
is
probably
another
of
his
inventions
it
is
to
the
effect
that
the
bell
of
the
church
at
deerfield
was
carried
by
the
indians
to
the
mission
of
regis
and
that
it
is
there
still
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
no
church
bell
at
deerfield
and
it
is
certain
that
regis
did
not
exist
till
more
than
a
after
deerfield
was
attacked
it
has
been
said
that
the
story
is
true
except
that
the
name
of
caughnawaga
should
be
substituted
for
that
of
regis
but
the
evidence
for
this
conjecture
is
weak

the
legend

the
bell

the

are
erroneous

has
been

as

to
the
motives
of
the
proposed
joseph
town
and
country
i
have
told
the
fate
of
deerfield
in
full
as
an
example
of
the
desolating
raids
which
for
years
swept
the
borders
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
the
rest
of
the
miserable
story
may
be
passed
more
briefly
it
is
in
the
main
a
weary
detail
of
the
murder
of
one
two
three
or
more
men
women
or
children
waylaid
in
fields
woods
and
lonely
roads
or
surprised
in
solitary
cabins
sometimes
the
attacks
were
on
a
larger
scale
thus
not
long
after
the
capture
of
deerfield
a
band
of
fifty
or
more
indians
fell
at
dawn
of
day
on
a
hamlet
of
five
houses
near
northampton
the
alarm
was
sounded
and
they
were
pursued
eight
of
the
prisoners
were
rescued
and
three
escaped
most
of
the
others
being
knocked
in
the
head
by
their
captors
at
oyster
river
the
indians
attacked
a
loopholed
house
in
which
the
women
of
the
neighboring
farms
had
taken
refuge
while
the
men
were
at
work
in
the
fields
the
women
disguised
themselves
in
hats
and
jackets
fired
from
the
loopholes
and
drove
off
the
assailants
in
a
hundred
and
eighty
french
and
indians
again
attacked
deerfield
but
failed
to
surprise
it
and
were
put
to
flight
at
dover
on
a
sunday
while
the
people
were
at
church
a
approached
a
fortified
house
the
garrison
of
which
consisted
of
one
woman
esther
jones
who
on
seeing
them
called
out
to
an
imaginary
force
within
here
they
are
come
on
come
on
on
which
the
indians
disappeared
soon
after
the
capture
of
deerfield
the
french
authorities
being
according
to
the
prisoner
williams
wonderfully
lifted
up
with
pride
formed
a
grand
and
assured
the
minister
that
they
would
catch
so
many
prisoners
that
they
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
beaucour
an
officer
of
great
repute
had
chief
command
and
his
force
consisted
of
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
men
of
whom
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
were
french
and
the
rest
mission
indians
they
declared
that
they
would
lay
waste
all
the
settlements
on
the
connecticut
meaning
it
seems
to
begin
with
hatfield
this
army
says
williams
went
away
in
such
a
boasting
triumphant
manner
that
i
had
great
hopes
god
would
discover
and
disappoint
their
designs
in
fact
their
plans
came
to
nought
owing
according
to
french
accounts
to
the
fright
of
the
indians
for
a
soldier
having
deserted
within
a
day
march
of
the
english
settlements
most
of
them
turned
back
despairing
of
a
surprise
and
the
rest
broke
up
into
small
parties
to
gather
scalps
on
the
outlying
farms
in
the
summer
of
there
was
a
more
successful
attempt
the
converts
of
all
the
canadian
missions
were
mustered
at
montreal
where
vaudreuil
by
exercising
as
he
says
the
patience
of
an
angel
soothed
their
mutual
jealousies
and
persuaded
them
to
go
upon
a
against
newbury
portsmouth
and
other
new
england
villages
fortunately
for
the
english
the
caughnawagas
were
only
towards
the
enterprise
and
through
them
the
watchful
peter
schuyler
got
hints
of
it
which
enabled
him
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
set
the
intended
victims
on
their
guard
the
party
consisted
of
about
four
hundred
of
whom
one
hundred
were
french
under
twelve
young
officers
and
cadets
the
whole
commanded
by
des
chaillons
and
hertel
de
rouville
for
the
sake
of
speed
and
secrecy
they
set
out
in
three
bodies
by
different
routes
the
rendezvous
was
at
lake
winnepesaukee
where
they
were
to
be
joined
by
the
norridgewocks
penobscots
and
other
eastern
abenakis
the
caughnawagas
and
hurons
turned
back
by
reason
of
evil
omens
and
a
disease
which
broke
out
among
them
the
rest
met
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
probably
at
alton
bay
where
after
waiting
in
vain
for
their
eastern
allies
they
resolved
to
make
no
attempt
on
portsmouth
or
newbury
but
to
turn
all
their
strength
upon
the
smaller
village
of
haverhill
on
the
merrimac
advancing
quickly
under
cover
of
night
they
made
their
onslaught
at
half
an
hour
before
dawn
on
sunday
the
of
august
haverhill
consisted
of
between
twenty
and
thirty
a
and
a
small
picket
fort
a
body
of
militia
from
the
lower
massachusetts
towns
had
been
hastily
distributed
along
the
frontier
on
the
vague
reports
of
danger
sent
by
schuyler
from
albany
and
as
the
intended
point
of
attack
was
unknown
the
men
were
of
necessity
widely
scattered
french
accounts
say
that
there
were
thirty
of
them
in
the
fort
at
haverhill
and
more
in
the
houses
of
the
villagers
while
others
still
were
posted
among
the
distant
farms
and
hamlets
in
spite
of
darkness
and
surprise
the
assailants
met
a
stiff
resistance
and
a
hot
and
persistent
fusillade
vaudreuil
says
that
they
could
dislodge
the
defenders
only
by
setting
fire
to
both
houses
and
fort
in
this
they
were
not
very
successful
as
but
few
of
the
dwellings
were
burned
a
fire
was
kindled
against
the
which
was
saved
by
one
davis
and
a
few
others
who
made
a
dash
from
behind
the
adjacent
parsonage
drove
the
indians
off
and
put
out
the
flames
rolfe
the
minister
had
already
been
killed
while
defending
his
house
his
wife
and
one
of
his
children
were
butchered
but
two
others
little
girls
of
six
and
eight
years
were
saved
by
the
of
his
hagar
apparently
a
negress
who
dragged
them
into
the
cellar
and
hid
them
under
two
inverted
tubs
where
they
crouched
dumb
with
terror
while
the
indians
ransacked
the
place
without
finding
them
english
accounts
say
that
the
number
of
persons
killed
men
women
and
children
was
which
the
french
increase
to
a
hundred
the
distant
roll
of
drums
was
presently
heard
warning
the
people
on
the
scattered
farms
on
which
the
assailants
made
a
hasty
retreat
posted
near
haverhill
were
three
militia
officers
turner
price
and
gardner
lately
arrived
from
salem
with
such
men
as
they
had
with
them
or
could
hastily
get
together
they
ambushed
themselves
at
the
edge
of
a
piece
of
woods
in
the
path
of
the
retiring
enemy
to
the
number
as
the
french
say
of
sixty
or
seventy
which
it
is
safe
to
diminish
by
a
half
the
french
and
indians
approaching
rapidly
were
met
by
a
volley
which
stopped
them
for
the
moment
then
throwing
down
their
packs
they
rushed
on
and
after
a
sharp
skirmish
broke
through
the
ambuscade
and
continued
their
retreat
vaudreuil
sets
their
total
loss
at
eight
killed
and
eighteen
wounded
the
former
including
two
officers
verchères
and
chambly
he
further
declares
that
in
the
skirmish
all
the
english
except
ten
or
twelve
were
killed
outright
while
the
english
accounts
say
that
the
french
and
indians
took
to
the
woods
leaving
nine
of
their
number
dead
on
the
spot
along
with
their
medicine
chest
and
all
their
packs
scarcely
a
hamlet
of
the
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
borders
escaped
a
visit
from
the
nimble
enemy
groton
lancaster
exeter
dover
kittery
casco
kingston
york
berwick
wells
winter
harbor
brookfield
amesbury
marlborough
were
all
more
or
less
infested
usually
by
small
hiding
in
the
outskirts
waylaying
stragglers
or
shooting
men
at
work
in
the
fields
and
disappearing
as
soon
as
their
blow
was
struck
these
swift
and
intangible
persecutors
were
found
a
far
surer
and
more
effectual
means
of
annoyance
than
larger
bodies
as
all
the
warriors
were
converts
of
the
canadian
missions
and
as
prisoners
were
an
article
of
value
cases
of
torture
were
not
very
common
though
now
and
then
as
at
exeter
they
would
roast
some
poor
wretch
alive
or
bite
off
his
fingers
and
sear
the
stumps
with
tobacco
pipes
this
system
of
petty
secret
and
transient
attack
put
the
impoverished
colonies
to
an
immense
charge
in
maintaining
a
cordon
of
militia
along
their
northern
frontier
a
precaution
often
as
vain
as
it
was
costly
for
the
wily
savages
covered
by
the
forest
found
little
difficulty
in
dodging
the
pouncing
on
their
victims
and
escaping
rewards
were
offered
for
scalps
but
one
writer
calculates
that
all
things
considered
it
cost
massachusetts
a
thousand
pounds
of
her
currency
to
kill
an
indian
in
six
hundred
men
were
kept
ranging
the
woods
all
winter
without
finding
a
single
indian
the
enemy
having
deserted
their
usual
haunts
and
sought
refuge
with
the
french
to
emerge
in
february
for
the
destruction
of
deerfield
in
the
next
summer
nineteen
hundred
men
were
posted
along
two
hundred
miles
of
frontier
this
attitude
of
passive
defence
exasperated
the
young
men
of
massachusetts
and
it
is
said
that
five
hundred
of
them
begged
dudley
for
leave
to
make
a
raid
into
canada
on
the
characteristic
condition
of
choosing
their
own
officers
the
governor
consented
but
on
a
message
from
peter
schuyler
that
he
had
at
last
got
a
promise
from
the
caughnawagas
and
other
mission
indians
to
attack
the
new
england
borders
no
more
the
raid
was
countermanded
lest
it
should
waken
the
tempest
anew
what
was
the
object
of
these
murderous
attacks
which
stung
the
enemy
without
disabling
him
confirmed
the
indians
in
their
native
savagery
and
taught
the
french
to
emulate
it
in
the
time
of
frontenac
there
was
a
palliating
motive
for
such
barbarous
warfare
canada
was
then
prostrate
and
stunned
under
the
blows
of
the
iroquois
war
successful
were
needed
as
a
tonic
and
a
stimulant
to
rouse
the
dashed
spirits
of
french
and
indians
alike
but
the
remedy
was
a
dangerous
one
and
it
drew
upon
the
colony
the
attack
under
sir
william
phips
which
was
near
proving
its
ruin
at
present
there
was
no
such
pressing
call
for
butchering
women
children
and
peaceful
farmers
the
motive
such
as
it
was
lay
in
the
fear
that
the
indian
allies
of
france
might
pass
over
to
the
english
or
at
least
stand
neutral
these
allies
were
the
christian
savages
of
the
missions
who
all
told
from
the
caughnawagas
to
the
micmacs
could
hardly
have
mustered
a
thousand
warriors
the
danger
was
that
the
caughnawagas
always
open
to
influence
from
albany
might
be
induced
to
lay
down
the
hatchet
and
persuade
the
rest
to
follow
their
example
therefore
as
there
was
for
the
time
a
virtual
truce
with
new
york
no
pains
were
spared
to
commit
them
irrevocably
to
war
against
new
england
with
the
abenaki
tribes
of
maine
and
new
hampshire
the
need
was
still
more
urgent
for
they
were
continually
drawn
to
new
england
by
the
cheapness
and
excellence
of
english
goods
and
the
only
sure
means
to
prevent
their
trading
with
the
enemy
was
to
incite
them
to
kill
him
some
of
these
savages
had
been
settled
in
canada
to
keep
them
under
influence
and
out
of
temptation
but
the
rest
were
still
in
their
native
haunts
where
it
was
thought
best
to
keep
them
well
watched
by
their
missionaries
as
sentinels
and
outposts
to
the
colony
there
were
those
among
the
french
to
whom
this
barbarous
warfare
was
repugnant
the
minister
ponchartrain
by
no
means
a
person
of
tender
scruples
also
condemned
it
for
a
time
after
the
attack
on
wells
and
other
places
under
beaubassin
in
he
wrote
it
would
have
been
well
if
this
expedition
had
not
taken
place
i
have
certain
knowledge
that
the
english
want
only
peace
knowing
that
war
is
contrary
to
the
interests
of
all
the
colonies
hostilities
in
canada
have
always
been
begun
by
the
french
afterwards
when
these
bloody
raids
had
produced
their
natural
effect
and
spurred
the
sufferers
to
attempt
the
ending
of
their
woes
once
for
all
by
the
conquest
of
canada
ponchartrain
changed
his
mind
and
encouraged
the
sending
out
of
to
keep
the
english
busy
at
home
the
schemes
of
a
radical
cure
date
from
the
attack
on
deerfield
and
the
murders
of
the
following
summer
in
the
autumn
we
find
governor
dudley
urging
the
capture
of
quebec
in
the
last
two
years
he
says
the
assembly
of
massachusetts
has
spent
about
in
defending
the
province
whereas
three
or
four
of
the
queen
ships
and
fifteen
hundred
new
england
men
would
rid
us
of
the
french
and
make
further
outlay
needless
a
view
it
must
be
admitted
sufficiently
sanguine
but
before
seeking
peace
with
the
sword
dudley
tried
less
strenuous
methods
it
may
be
remembered
that
in
captain
vetch
and
samuel
hill
together
with
the
governor
young
son
william
went
to
quebec
to
procure
an
exchange
of
prisoners
their
mission
had
also
another
object
vetch
carried
a
letter
from
dudley
to
vaudreuil
proposing
a
treaty
of
neutrality
between
their
respective
colonies
and
vaudreuil
seems
to
have
welcomed
the
proposal
notwithstanding
the
pacific
relations
between
canada
and
new
york
he
was
in
constant
fear
that
dutch
and
english
influence
might
turn
the
five
nations
into
open
enemies
of
the
french
and
he
therefore
declared
himself
ready
to
accept
the
proposals
of
dudley
on
condition
that
new
york
and
the
other
english
colonies
should
be
included
in
the
treaty
and
that
the
english
should
be
excluded
from
fishing
in
the
gulf
of
lawrence
and
the
acadian
seas
the
first
condition
was
difficult
and
the
second
impracticable
for
nothing
could
have
induced
the
people
of
new
england
to
accept
it
vaudreuil
moreover
would
not
promise
to
give
up
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
but
only
to
do
what
he
could
to
persuade
their
owners
to
give
them
up
the
negotiations
dragged
on
for
several
years
for
the
first
three
or
four
months
vaudreuil
stopped
his
but
he
let
them
loose
again
in
the
spring
and
the
new
england
borders
were
tormented
as
before
the
french
governor
thought
that
the
new
england
country
people
who
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
war
were
ready
to
accept
his
terms
the
french
court
approved
the
plan
though
not
without
distrust
for
some
enemy
of
the
governor
told
ponchartrain
that
under
pretence
of
negotiations
he
and
dudley
were
carrying
on
trading
speculations
which
is
certainly
a
baseless
slander
vaudreuil
on
his
part
had
strongly
suspected
dudley
emissary
vetch
of
illicit
trade
during
his
visit
to
quebec
and
perhaps
there
was
ground
for
the
suspicion
it
is
certain
that
vetch
who
had
visited
the
lawrence
before
lost
no
opportunity
of
studying
the
river
and
looked
forward
to
a
time
when
he
could
turn
his
knowledge
to
practical
account
joseph
dudley
governor
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
was
the
son
of
a
former
governor
of
massachusetts
that
upright
sturdy
narrow
bigoted
old
puritan
thomas
dudley
in
whose
pocket
was
found
after
his
death
the
notable
couplet
let
men
of
god
in
courts
and
churches
watch
such
as
do
a
toleration
hatch
such
a
son
of
such
a
father
was
the
marvel
of
new
england
those
who
clung
to
the
old
traditions
and
mourned
for
the
old
theocracy
under
the
old
charter
hated
joseph
dudley
as
a
renegade
and
the
worshippers
of
the
puritans
have
not
forgiven
him
to
this
day
he
had
been
president
of
the
council
under
the
detested
andros
and
when
that
representative
of
the
stuarts
was
overthrown
by
a
popular
revolution
both
he
and
dudley
were
sent
prisoners
to
england
here
they
found
a
reception
different
from
the
expectations
and
wishes
of
those
who
sent
them
dudley
became
a
member
of
parliament
and
of
the
isle
of
wight
and
was
at
length
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
queen
anne
sent
back
to
govern
those
who
had
cast
him
out
any
governor
imposed
on
them
by
england
would
have
been
an
offence
but
joseph
dudley
was
more
than
they
could
bear
he
found
bitter
opposition
from
the
old
puritan
party
the
two
mathers
father
and
son
who
through
policy
had
at
first
favored
him
soon
denounced
him
with
insolent
malignity
and
the
honest
and
conscientious
samuel
sewall
regarded
him
with
as
much
asperity
as
his
kindly
nature
would
permit
to
the
party
of
religious
and
political
independency
he
was
an
abomination
and
great
efforts
were
made
to
get
him
recalled
two
pamphlets
of
the
time
one
printed
in
and
the
other
in
the
next
year
reflect
the
bitter
animosity
he
excited
both
seem
to
be
the
work
of
several
persons
one
of
whom
there
can
be
little
doubt
was
cotton
mather
for
it
is
not
easy
to
mistake
the
mingled
flippancy
and
pedantry
of
his
style
he
bore
the
governor
a
grudge
for
dudley
had
chafed
him
in
his
inordinate
vanity
and
love
of
power
if
dudley
loved
himself
first
he
loved
his
native
new
england
next
and
was
glad
to
serve
her
if
he
could
do
so
in
his
own
way
and
without
too
much
sacrifice
of
his
own
interests
he
was
possessed
by
a
restless
ambition
apparently
of
the
cheap
kind
that
prefers
the
first
place
in
a
small
community
to
the
second
in
a
large
one
he
was
skilled
in
the
arts
of
the
politician
and
knew
how
by
attentions
dinners
or
commissions
in
the
militia
to
influence
his
council
and
assembly
to
do
his
will
his
abilities
were
beyond
question
and
his
manners
easy
and
graceful
but
his
instincts
were
arbitrary
he
stood
fast
for
prerogative
and
even
his
hereditary
calvinism
had
strong
episcopal
leanings
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
in
the
better
as
well
as
the
worse
sense
of
the
term
was
loved
and
admired
by
some
as
much
as
he
was
hated
by
others
and
in
the
words
of
one
of
his
successors
had
as
many
virtues
as
can
consist
with
so
great
a
thirst
for
honor
and
power
his
enemies
however
set
no
bounds
to
their
denunciation
all
the
people
here
are
bought
and
sold
betwixt
the
governour
and
his
son
paul
says
one
it
is
my
belief
says
another
probably
cotton
mather
that
he
means
to
help
the
french
and
indians
to
destroy
all
they
can
and
again
he
is
a
criminal
governour
his
god
is
mammon
his
aim
is
the
ruin
of
his
country
the
meagreness
and
uncertainty
of
his
salary
which
was
granted
by
yearly
votes
of
the
assembly
gave
color
to
the
charge
that
he
abused
his
official
position
to
improve
his
income
the
worst
accusation
against
him
was
that
of
conniving
in
trade
with
the
french
and
indians
under
pretence
of
exchanging
prisoners
six
prominent
men
of
the
colony
borland
vetch
lawson
rous

only
three
of
whom
were
of
new
england
origin
were
brought
to
trial
before
the
assembly
for
trading
at
port
royal
and
it
was
said
that
dudley
though
he
had
no
direct
share
in
the
business
found
means
to
make
profit
from
it
all
the
accused
were
convicted
and
fined
the
more
strenuous
of
their
judges
were
for
sending
them
to
jail
and
rous
was
to
have
been
sentenced
to
sit
an
hour
upon
the
gallows
with
a
rope
about
his
neck
but
the
governor
and
council
objected
to
these
severities
and
the
assembly
forbore
to
impose
them
the
popular
indignation
against
the
accused
was
extreme
and
probably
not
without
cause
there
was
no
doubt
an
illicit
trade
between
boston
and
the
french
of
acadia
who
during
the
war
often
depended
on
their
enemies
for
the
necessaries
of
life
since
supplies
from
france
precarious
at
the
best
were
made
doubly
so
by
new
england
cruisers
thus
the
acadians
and
their
indian
allies
were
but
too
happy
to
exchange
their
furs
for
very
modest
supplies
of
tools
utensils
and
perhaps
at
times
of
arms
powder
and
lead
what
with
privateering
and
illicit
trade
it
was
clear
that
the
war
was
a
source
of
profit
to
some
of
the
chief
persons
in
boston
that
place
moreover
felt
itself
tolerably
safe
from
attack
while
the
borders
were
stung
from
end
to
end
as
by
a
swarm
of
wasps
and
thus
the
country
conceived
the
idea
that
the
town
was
fattening
at
its
expense
vaudreuil
reports
to
the
minister
that
the
people
of
new
england
want
to
avenge
themselves
by
an
attack
on
canada
but
that
their
chief
men
are
for
a
policy
of
defence
this
was
far
from
being
wholly
true
but
the
notion
that
the
rural
population
bore
a
grudge
against
boston
had
taken
strong
hold
of
the
french
who
even
believed
that
if
the
town
were
attacked
the
country
would
not
move
hand
or
foot
to
help
it
perhaps
it
was
well
for
them
that
they
did
not
act
on
the
belief
which
as
afterwards
appeared
was
one
of
their
many
mistakes
touching
the
character
and
disposition
of
their
english
neighbors
the
sentences
on
borland
and
his
five
companions
were
annulled
by
the
queen
and
council
on
the
ground
that
the
assembly
was
not
competent
to
try
the
case
the
passionate
charges
against
dudley
and
a
petition
to
the
queen
for
his
removal
were
equally
unavailing
the
assemblies
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
the
chief
merchants
the
officers
of
militia
and
many
of
the
ministers
sent
addresses
to
the
queen
in
praise
of
the
governor
administration
and
though
his
enemies
declared
that
the
votes
and
signatures
were
obtained
by
the
arts
familiar
to
him
his
recall
was
prevented
and
he
held
his
office
seven
years
longer

the

duly
submissive

it

so
if

but
the

had

been

of

by
a
new

privateer
which
had
driven
their

from

and
when
the

that
their
opportunities
are
good
since
at

a

vessels
enter

besides
these
irregular

the

usually
had
at
his
disposal
two
french
frigates
of
thirty

guns
to
which
was

of

stream
now
called

whence
it
looked
down
the
long
basin

which
framed
in

had
so
won
the
heart
of
the
baron

century
before

small
counting
in

a

and

eighty
small
houses
of
one
story
and
an
attic
built
of
planks
boards

simple
and
rude

tolerably
comfortable
it
had
also
a
small
new
wooden
church
to
the
building
of
which
the
inhabitants
had
contributed
eight
hundred
francs
while
the

paid
the
rest
the
inhabitants
had
no
voice
whatever
in
public
affairs
though
the
colonial
minister
had
granted
them
the
privilege
of
travelling
in
time
of

without
passports
the
ruling
class
civil
and

formed
a
group
apart
living
in

near
the
fort
in
complete
independence
of
public
opinion
supposing
such
to
have
existed
they
looked
only
to
their
masters
at
versailles
and
hence
a
state
of
things
as
curious
as
it
was
lamentable
the
little
settlement
was
a
of
gossip
backbiting
and
slander
officials
of

continually
trying

the
governor
was

seems
to
have
been
of
an
irritable
temper
aggravated
perhaps
by
an
old
unhealed
wound
in
the
cheek
which
gave
him
constant
annoyance
one
writer
declares
that
acadia
languishes
under
selfish
greed
and
petty
tyranny
that
everything
was
hoped
from
brouillan
when
he
first
came
but
that
hope
has
changed
to
despair
that
he
abuses
the
king
authority
to
make
money
sells
wine
and
brandy
at
retail
quarrels
with
officers
who
are
not
punctilious
enough

the

to
catch

the
accuser
as

brouillan
died
in
the
autumn
of
on
which
de
goutin
a
magistrate
who
acted
as
intendant
and
was
therefore
at
once
the
colleague
of
the
late
governor
and
a
spy
upon
him
writes
to
the
minister
that
the
divine
justice
has
at
last
taken
pity
on
the
good
people
of
this
country
but
that
as
it
is
base
to
accuse
a
dead
man
he
will
not
say
that
the
public
could
not
help
showing
their
joy
at
the
late
governor
departure
and
he
adds
that
the
deceased
was
charged
with
a
scandalous
connection
with
the
widow
de
freneuse
nor
will
he
reply
he
says
to
the
governor
complaint
to
the
court
about
a
pretended
cabal
of
which
he
de
goutin
was
the
head
and
which
was
in
reality
only
three
or
four
honest
men
incapable
of
any
kind
of
deviation
who
used
to
meet
in
a
friendly
way
and
had
given
offence
by
not
bowing
down
before
the
beast
then
he
changes
the
subject
and
goes
on
to
say
that
on
a
certain
festal
occasion
he
was
invited
by
bonaventure
who
acted
as
governor
after
the
death
of
brouillan
to
share
with
him
the
honor
of
touching
off
a
bonfire
before
the
fort
gate
and
that
this
excited
such
envy
jealousy
and
discord
that
he
begs
the
minister
once
for
all
to
settle
the
question
whether
a
first
magistrate
has
not
the
right
to
the
honor
of
touching
off
a
bonfire
jointly
with
a
governor
de
goutin
sometimes
discourses
of
more
serious
matters
he
tells
the
minister
that
the
inhabitants
have
plenty
of
cattle
and
more
hemp
than
they
can
use
but
neither
pots
scythes
sickles
knives
hatchets
kettles
for
the
indians
nor
salt
for
themselves
we
should
be
fortunate
if
our
enemies
would
continue
to
supply
our
necessities
and
take
the
with
which
the
colony
is
gorged
adding
however
that
the
acadians
hate
the
english
and
will
not
trade
with
them
if
they
can
help
it
in
the
next
year
the
bastonnais
were
again
bringing
supplies
and
the
acadians
again
receiving
them
the
new
governor
subercase
far
from
being
pleased
at
this
was
much
annoyed
or
professed
to
be
so
and
wrote
to
ponchartrain
nobody
could
suffer
more
than
i
do
at
seeing
the
english
so
coolly
carry
on
their
trade
under
our
very
noses
then
he
proceeds
to
the
inevitable
personalities
you
wish
me
to
write
without
reserve
of
the
officers
here
i
have
little
good
to
tell
you
and
he
names
two
who
to
the
best
of
his
belief
have
lost
their
wits
a
third
who
is
incorrigibly
lazy
and
a
fourth
who
is
eccentric
adding
that
he
is
tolerably
well
satisfied
with
the
rest
except
de
la
ronde
you
see
monseigneur
that
i
am
as
much
in
need
of
a
madhouse
as
of
barracks
and
what
is
worse
i
am
afraid
that
the
of
this
country
will
drive
me
crazy
too
you
write
to
me
he
continues
that
you
are
informed
that
labat
has
killed
some
cattle
belonging
to
the
inhabitants
if
so
he
has
expiated
his
fault
by
blowing
off
his
thumb
by
the
bursting
of
his
gun
while
he
was
firing
at
a
sheep
i
am
sure
that
the
moon
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
his
behavior
he
always
acts
very
strangely
when
she
is
on
the
wane
the
charge
brought
against
brouillan
in
regard
to
madame
de
freneuse
was
brought
also
against
bonaventure
in
connection
with
the
same
lady
the
story
says
subercase
was
pushed
as
far
as
hell
could
desire
and
he
partially
defends
the
accused
declaring
that
at
least
his
fidelity
to
the
king
is
beyond
question
de
goutin
had
a
quarrel
with
subercase
and
writes
i
do
all
that
is
possible
to
live
on
good
terms
with
him
and
to
that
end
i
walk
as
if
in
the
chamber
of
a
sick
prince
whose
sleep
is
of
the
lightest
as
subercase
defends
bonaventure
de
goutin
attacks
him
and
gives
particulars
concerning
him
and
madame
de
freneuse
which
need
not
be
recounted
here
then
comes
a
story
about
a
quarrel
caused
by
some
cows
belonging
to
madame
de
freneuse
which
got
into
the
garden
of
madame
de
and
were
driven
out
by
a
soldier
who
presumed
to
strike
one
of
them
with
a
long
stick
the
facts
gravely
adds
de
goutin
have
been
certified
to
me
as
i
have
the
honor
to
relate
them
to
your
grandeur
then
the
minister
is
treated
to
a
story
of
one
allein
he
insulted
madame
de
belleisle
at
the
church
door
after
high
mass
and
when
her
son
a
boy
of
fourteen
interposed
allein
gave
him
such
a
box
on
the
ear
that
it
drew
blood
and
i
am
assured
that
petit
the
priest
ran
to
the
rescue
in
his
sacerdotal
robes
subercase
on
his
side
after
complaining
that
the
price
of
a
certain
canoe
had
been
unjustly
deducted
from
his
pay
though
he
never
had
the
said
canoe
at
all
protests
to
ponchartrain
there
is
no
country
on
earth
where
i
would
not
rather
live
than
in
this
by
reason
of
the
persons
who
inhabit
it
there
was
the
usual
friction
between
the
temporal
and
the
spiritual
powers
the
church
writes
subercase
has
long
claimed
the
right
of
commanding
here
or
at
least
of
sharing
authority
with
the
civil
rulers
the
church
had
formerly
been
represented
by
the
capuchin
friars
and
afterwards
by
the
récollets
every
complaint
was
of
course
carried
to
the
minister
in
we
find
de
villieu
who
then
held
a
provisional
command
in
the
colony
accusing
the
ecclesiastics
of
illicit
trade
with
the
english
bonaventure
reports
to
ponchartrain
that
père
félix
chaplain
of
the
fort
asked
that
the
gate
might
be
opened
in
order
that
he
might
carry
the
sacraments
to
a
sick
man
his
real
object
being
to
marry
captain
duvivier
to
a
young
woman
named
marie
muis
de
poubomcoup
contrary
as
the
governor
thought
to
the
good
of
the
service
he
therefore
forbade
the
match
on
which
the
priests
told
him
that
when
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
do
anything
nobody
had
power
to
turn
them
from
it
and
the
chaplain
presently
added
that
he
cared
no
more
for
the
governor
than
for
the
mud
on
his
shoes
he
carried
his
point
and
married
duvivier
in
spite
of
the
commander
every
king
ship
from
acadia
brought
to
ponchartrain
letters
full
of
matters
like
these
in
one
year
he
got
at
least
fourteen
such
if
half
of
what
tells
us
of
him
is
true
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
gave
himself
much
trouble
concerning
them
this
does
not
make
it
the
less
astonishing
that
in
the
midst
of
a
great
and
disastrous
war
a
minister
of
state
should
be
expected
to
waste
time
on
matters
worthy
of
a
knot
of
old
gossips
babbling
round
a
that
pompous
spectre
which
calls
itself
the
dignity
of
history
would
scorn
to
take
note
of
them
yet
they
are
highly
instructive
for
the
morbid
anatomy
of
this
little
colony
has
a
scientific
value
as
exhibiting
all
the
more
vividly
for
the
narrowness
of
the
field
the
workings
of
an
unmitigated
paternalism
acting
from
across
the
atlantic
the
servants
in
acadia
pestered
his
minister
at
versailles
with
their
pettiest
squabbles
while
marlborough
and
eugene
were
threatening
his
throne
with
destruction
the
same
system
prevailed
in
canada
but
as
there
the
field
was
broader
and
the
men
often
larger
the
effects
are
less
whimsically
vivid
than
they
appear
under
the
acadian
microscope
the
two
provinces
however
were
ruled
alike
and
about
this
time
the
canadian
intendant
raudot
was
writing
to
ponchartrain
in
a
strain
worthy
of

reprisal
was
difficult
against
those
who
had

canada
was
made
almost
inaccessible
by
a
hundred
leagues
of
pathless
forest
prowled
by

allies
who
were
sure
to
give
the

approaching
foe
while
on

hand
the

could
easily
reach
acadia
by

hence
that

often
made

major

the
noted
indian
fighter
of
king
philip
war
was
at
tiverton
in
rhode
island
when
he
heard
of
hertel
de
attack
on
deerfield
boiling
with
rage
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
to
boston
to
propose
a
stroke
of
retaliation
church
was
energetic
impetuous
and
years
old
and
grown
so
fat
that
when
pushing
through
the
woods
on
the
trail
of
indians
he
kept
a
stout
sergeant
by
him
to
hoist
him
over
fallen
trees
governor
dudley
approved
his
scheme
and
appointed
him
to
command
the
expedition
with
the
rank
of
colonel
church
repaired
to
his
native
duxbury
and
here
as
well
as
in
plymouth
and
other
neighboring
settlements
the
militia
were
called
out
and
the
veteran
readily
persuaded
a
sufficient
number
to
volunteer
under
him
with
the
indians
of
cape
cod
he
found
more
difficulty
they
being
as
his
son
observes
a
people
that
need
much
treating
especially
with
drink
at
last
however
some
of
them
were
induced
to
join
him
church
now
returned
to
boston
and
begged
that
an
attack
on
port
royal
might
be
included
in
his
instructions
which
was
refused
on
the
ground
that
a
plan
to
that
effect
had
been
laid
before
the
queen
and
that
nothing
could
be
done
till
her
answer
was
received
the
governor
enemies
seized
the
occasion
to
say
that
he
wished
port
royal
to
remain
french
in
order
to
make
money
by
trading
with
it
the
whole
force
including
indians
and
sailors
amounted
to
about
seven
hundred
men
they
sailed
to
matinicus
in
brigs
and
sloops
the
province
galley
and
two
british
frigates
from
matinicus
most
of
the
were
sent
to
mount
desert
to
wait
orders
while
the
main
body
rowed
eastward
in
touching
at
fort
where
the
town
of
castine
now
stands
they
killed
or
captured
everybody
they
found
there
receiving
false
information
that
there
was
a
large
on
the
west
side
of
passamaquoddy
bay
they
hastened
to
the
place
reached
it
in
the
night
and
pushed
into
the
woods
in
hope
of
surprising
the
enemy
the
movement
was
difficult
and
church
men
being
little
better
than
a
mob
disregarded
his
commands
and
fell
into
disorder
he
raged
and
stormed
and
presently
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
descrying
a
hut
or
cabin
on
the
farther
side
of
a
small
brook
with
a
crowd
gathered
about
it
he
demanded
what
was
the
matter
and
was
told
that
there
were
frenchmen
inside
who
would
not
come
out
then
knock
them
in
the
head
shouted
the
choleric
old
man
and
he
was
obeyed
it
was
said
that
the
victims
belonged
to
a
party
of
canadians
captured
just
before
under
a
promise
of
life
afterwards
when
church
returned
to
boston
there
was
an
outcry
of
indignation
against
him
for
this
butchery
in
any
case
however
he
could
have
known
nothing
of
the
alleged
promise
of
quarter
to
hunt
indians
with
an
endless
forest
behind
them
was
like
chasing
shadows
the
acadians
were
surer
game
church
sailed
with
a
part
of
his
force
up
the
bay
of
fundy
and
landed
at
grand
pré
a
place
destined
to
a
dismal
notoriety
half
a
century
later
the
inhabitants
of
this
and
the
neighboring
settlements
made
some
slight
resistance
and
killed
a
lieutenant
named
baker
and
one
soldier
after
which
they
fled
when
church
first
causing
the
houses
to
be
examined
to
make
sure
that
nobody
was
left
in
them
ordered
them
to
be
set
on
fire
the
dikes
were
then
broken
and
the
tide
let
in
upon
the
growing
crops
in
spite
of
these
harsh
proceedings
he
fell
far
short
in
his
retaliation
for
the
barbarities
at
deerfield
since
he
restrained
his
indians
and
permitted
no
woman
or
child
to
be
hurt
at
the
same
time
telling
his
prisoners
that
if
any
other
new
england
village
were
treated
as
deerfield
had
been
he
would
come
back
with
a
thousand
indians
and
leave
them
free
to
do
what
they
pleased
with
this
bluster
he
left
the
unfortunate
peasants
in
the
extremity
of
terror
after
carrying
off
as
many
of
them
as
were
needed
for
purposes
of
exchange
a
small
detachment
was
sent
to
beaubassin
where
it
committed
similar
havoc
church
now
steered
for
port
royal
which
he
had
been
forbidden
to
attack
the
two
frigates
and
the
transports
had
by
this
time
rejoined
him
and
in
spite
of
dudley
orders
to
make
no
attempt
on
the
french
fort
the
british
and
provincial
officers
met
in
council
to
consider
whether
to
do
so
with
one
voice
they
decided
in
the
negative
since
they
had
only
four
hundred
men
available
for
landing
while
the
french
garrison
was
no
doubt
much
stronger
having
had
ample
time
to
call
the
inhabitants
to
its
aid
church
therefore
after
trying
the
virtue
of
a
bombastic
summons
to
surrender
and
destroying
a
few
houses
sailed
back
to
boston
it
was
a
miserable
retaliation
for
a
barbarous
outrage
as
the
guilty
were
out
of
reach
the
invaders
turned
their
ire
on
the
innocent
if
port
royal
in
french
hands
was
a
source
of
illicit
gain
to
some
persons
in
boston
it
was
also
an
occasion
of
loss
by
the
privateers
and
corsairs
it
sent
out
to
prey
on
trading
and
fishing
vessels
while
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
standing
menace
as
the
possible
naval
base
for
one
of
those
armaments
against
the
new
england
capital
which
were
often
threatened
though
never
carried
into
effect
hence
in
the
new
england
colonists
made
in
their
bungling
way
a
serious
attempt
to
get
possession
of
it
dudley
enemies
raised
the
old
cry
that
at
heart
he
wished
port
royal
to
remain
french
and
was
only
forced
by
popular
clamor
to
countenance
an
attack
upon
it
the
charge
seems
a
malicious
slander
early
in
march
he
proposed
the
enterprise
to
the
general
court
and
the
question
being
referred
to
a
committee
they
reported
that
a
thousand
soldiers
should
be
raised
vessels
impressed
and
her
majesty
frigate
deptford
with
the
province
galley
employed
to
convoy
them
an
act
was
passed
accordingly
two
regiments
were
soon
afoot
one
uniformed
in
red
and
the
other
in

one
commanded
by
colonel
francis
wainwright
and
the
other
by

more

the
expedition
sailed
on
the
thirteenth
of
may
and
included
one
thousand
and
soldiers
with
about
four
hundred
and
fifty
sailors
the
soldiers
were
nearly
all
volunteers
from
the
rural
militia
and
their
training
and
discipline
were
such
as
they
had
acquired
in
the
uncouth
frolics
and
plentiful
new
england
rum
of
the
periodical
muster
days
there
chanced
to
be
one
officer
who
knew
more
or
less
of
the
work
in
hand
this
was
the
english
engineer
rednap
sent
out
to
look
after
the
fortifications
of
new
york
and
new
england
the
was
colonel
john
march
of
newbury
who
had
popular
qualities
had
seen
frontier
service
and
was
personally
brave
but
totally
unfit
for
his

position

of

intelligent
youth
william
dudley
son
of

new

has
been
blamed
for
not
employing
trained
officers
to
command
her
levies
but
with
the
exception
of
rednap
and
possibly
of
captain
samuel
vetch
there
were
none
in

nor
were

wanted

their
stubborn
and
jealous
independence
the
sons
of

puritans
would
have
resented
their
presence
the
provincial
officers
were
without
exception
civilians
british
regular
officers
good
bad
or
indifferent
were
apt
to
put
on
airs

superiority
which
galled

of

rather
than

early
in
june
the
expedition
sailed
into
port
royal
basin
and
appleton
with
three
hundred
and
fifty
men
landed
on
the
north
shore
four
or
five
miles
below
the
fort
marched
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
annapolis
and
was
there
met
by
an
ambushed
body
of
french
who
being
outnumbered
presently
took
to
their
boats
and
retreated
to
the
fort
meanwhile
march
with
seven
hundred
and
fifty
men
landed
on
the
south
shore
and
pushed
on
to
the
meadows
of
allen
river
which
they
were
crossing
in
battle
array
when
a
fire
blazed
out
upon
them
from
a
bushy
hill
on
the
farther
bank
where
about
two
hundred
french
lay
in
ambush
under
subercase
the
governor
march
and
his
men
crossed
the
stream
and
after
a
skirmish
that
did
little
harm
to
either
side
the
french
gave
way
the
english
then
advanced
to
a
hill
known
as
the
lion
rampant
within
of
the
fort
and
here
began
to
intrench
themselves
stretching
their
lines
right
and
left
towards
the
annapolis
on
the
one
hand
and
allen
river
on
the
other
so
as
to
form
a
semicircle
before
the
fort
where
all
the
inhabitants
had
by
this
time
taken
refuge
soon
all
was
confusion
in
the
new
england
camp
the
consequence
of
march
incapacity
for
a
large
command
and
the
greenness
and
ignorance
of
both
himself
and
his
subordinates
there
were
conflicting
opinions
wranglings
and
disputes
the
men
losing
all
confidence
in
their
officers
became
unmanageable
the
devil
was
at
work
among
us
writes
one
of
those
present
the
engineer
rednap
the
only
one
of
them
who
knew
anything
of
the
work
in
hand
began
to
mark
out
the
batteries
but
he
soon
lost
temper
and
declared
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
venture
his
reputation
with
such
ungovernable
and
undisciplined
men
and
inconstant
officers
he
refused
to
bring
up
the
cannon
saying
that
it
could
not
be
done
under
the
fire
of
the
fort
and
the
naval
captains
were
of
the
same
opinion
one
of
the
chaplains
rev
john
barnard
being
of
a
martial
turn
and
full
of
zeal
took
it
upon
himself
to
make
a
plan
of
the
fort
and
to
that
end
after
providing
himself
with
pen
ink
paper
and
a
took
his
seat
at
a
convenient
spot
but
his
task
was
scarcely
begun
when
it
was
ended
by
a
that
struck
the
ground
beside
him
peppered
him
with
gravel
and
caused
his
prompt
retreat
french
deserters
reported
that
there
were
five
hundred
men
in
the
fort
with
heavy
cannon
and
that
four
or
five
hundred
more
were
expected
every
day
this
increased
the
general
bewilderment
of
the
besiegers
there
was
a
council
of
war
rednap
declared
that
it
would
be
useless
to
persist
and
after
hot
debate
and
contradiction
it
was
resolved
to
decamp
three
days
after
there
was
another
council
which
voted
to
bring
up
the
cannon
and
open
fire
in
spite
of
rednap
and
the
naval
captains
but
in
the
next
evening
a
third
council
resolved
again
to
raise
the
siege
as
hopeless
this
disgusted
the
rank
and
file
who
were
a
little
soothed
by
an
order
to
destroy
the
storehouse
and
other
buildings
outside
the
fort
and
ill
led
as
they
were
they
did
the
work
thoroughly
never
did
men
act
more
boldly
says
the
witness
before
quoted
they
threatened
the
enemy
to
his
nose
and
would
have
taken
the
fort
if
the
officers
had
shown
any
spirit
they
found
it
hard
to
bring
them
off
at
the
end
we
broke
up
with
the
confusion
of
babel
and
went
about
our
business
like
fools
the
baffled
invaders
sailed
crestfallen
to
casco
bay
and
a
vessel
was
sent
to
carry
news
of
the
miscarriage
to
dudley
who
vexed
and
incensed
ordered
another
attempt
march
was
in
a
state
of
helpless
indecision
increased
by
a
bad
cold
but
the
governor
would
not
recall
him
and
chose
instead
the
lamentable
expedient
of
sending
three
members
of
the
provincial
council
to
advise
and
direct
him
two
of
them
had
commissions
in
the
militia

john
leverett
was
a
learned
bachelor
of
divinity
formerly
a
tutor
in
harvard
college
and
soon
after
its
president
capable
no
doubt
of
preaching
calvinistic
sermons
to
the
students
but
totally
unfit
to
command
men
or
conduct
a
siege
young
william
dudley
was
writing
meanwhile
to
his
father
how
jealousies
and
quarrels
were
rife
among
the
officers
how
their
conduct
bred
disorder
and
desertion
among
the
soldiers
and
how
colonel
march
and
others
behaved
as
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
make
themselves
popular
many
of
the
officers
seem
in
fact
to
have
been
small
politicians
in
search
of
notoriety
with
an
eye
to
votes
or
appointments
captain
stuckley
of
the
british
frigate
wrote
to
the
governor
in
great
discontent
about
the
nonsensical
malice
of
appleton
and
adds
i
do
see
what
good
i
can
do
by
lying
here
where
i
am
almost
murdered
by
mosquitoes
the
three
commissioners
came
at
last
with
a
reinforcement
of
another
frigate
and
a
hundred
recruits
which
did
not
supply
losses
as
the
soldiers
had
deserted
by
scores
in
great
the
expedition
sailed
back
to
port
royal
where
it
was
found
that
reinforcements
had
also
reached
the
french
including
a
strongly
manned
privateer
from
martinique
the
new
england
men
landed
and
there
was
some
sharp
skirmishing
in
an
orchard
chaplain
barnard
took
part
in
the
fray
a
shot
brushed
my
wig
he
says
but
i
was
mercifully
preserved
we
soon
drove
them
out
of
the
orchard
killed
a
few
of
them
desperately
wounded
the
privateer
captain
and
after
that
we
all
embarked
and
returned
to
boston
as
fast
as
we
could
this
summary
statement
is
imperfect
for
there
was
a
good
deal
of
skirmishing
from
the
thirteenth
august
to
the
twentieth
when
the
invaders
sailed
for
home
march
was
hooted
as
he
walked
boston
streets
and
children
ran
after
him
crying
wooden
sword
there
was
an
attempt
at
a
but
so
many
officers
were
accused
on
one
ground
or
another
that
hardly
enough
were
left
to
try
them
and
the
matter
was
dropped
with
one
remarkable
exception
the
new
england
militia
reaped
scant
laurels
on
their
various
expeditions
eastward
but
of
all
their
shortcomings
this
was
the
most
discreditable
meanwhile
events
worthy
of
note
were
passing
in
newfoundland
that
island
was
divided
between
the
two
conflicting
powers
the
chief
station
of
the
french
being
at
placentia
and
that
of
the
english
at
john
in
january
subercase
who
soon
after
became
governor
of
acadia
marched
with
four
hundred
and
fifty
soldiers
canadians
and
buccaneers
aided
by
a
band
of
indians
against
john
a
defended
by
two
forts
the
smaller
known
as
the
castle
held
by
twelve
men
and
the
larger
called
fort
william
by
forty
men
under
captain
moody
the
latter
was
attacked
by
the
french
who
were
beaten
off
on
which
they
burned
the
unprotected
houses
and
with
a
brutality
equal
to
that
of
church
in
acadia
and
followed
up
the
exploit
by
destroying
the
hamlet
at
ferryland
and
all
the
defenceless
hovels
and
along
the
shore
towards
trinity
bay
and
bonavista
four
years
later
the
sieur
de
a
nephew
of
brouillan
late
governor
at
port
royal
struck
a
more
creditable
blow
he
set
out
from
placentia
on
the
thirteenth
of
december
with
one
hundred
and
men
and
on
the
first
of
january
approached
fort
william
two
hours
before
day
found
the
gate
leading
to
the
covered
way
open
entered
with
a
band
of
volunteers
rapidly
crossed
the
ditch
planted
ladders
against
the
wall
and
leaped
into
the
fort
then
as
he
declares
garrisoned
by
a
hundred
men
his
main
body
followed
close
the
english
were
taken
unawares
their
commander
who
showed
great
courage
was
struck
down
by
three
shots
and
after
some
sharp
fighting
the
place
was
in
the
hands
of
the
assailants
the
small
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
capitulated
on
the
second
day
and
the
palisaded
village
of
the
inhabitants
which
if
we
are
to
believe
contained
nearly
six
hundred
men
made
little
resistance
john
became
for
the
moment
a
french
possession
but
costebelle
governor
at
placentia
despaired
of
holding
it
and
it
was
abandoned
in
the
following
summer
about
this
time
a
scheme
was
formed
for
the
permanent
riddance
of
new
england
from
by
the
conquest
of
canada
the
prime
mover
in
it
was
samuel
vetch
whom
we
have
seen
as
an
emissary
to
quebec
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
and
also
as
one
of
the
notables
fined
for
illicit
trade
with
the
french
he
came
of
a
respectable
scotch
family
his
grandfather
his
father
three
of
his
uncles
and
one
of
his
brothers
were
covenanting
ministers
who
had
suffered
some
persecution
under
charles
ii
he
himself
was
destined
for
the
ministry
but
his
inclinations
being
in
no
way
clerical
he
and
his
brother
william
got
commissions
in
the
army
and
took
an
active
part
in
the
war
that
ended
with
the
peace
of
ryswick
in
the
next
year
the
two
brothers
sailed
for
the
isthmus
of
panama
as
captains
in
the
band
of
adventurers
embarked
in
the
disastrous
enterprise
known
as
the
darien
scheme
william
vetch
died
at
sea
and
samuel
repaired
to
new
york
where
he
married
a
daughter
of
robert
livingston
one
of
the
chief
men
of
the
colony
and
engaged
largely
in
the
canadian
trade
from
new
york
he
went
to
boston
where
we
find
him
when
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
began
during
his
several
visits
to
canada
he
had
carefully
studied
the
lawrence
and
its
shores
and
boasted
that
he
knew
them
better
than
the
canadians
themselves
he
was
impetuous
sanguine
energetic
and
headstrong
astute
withal
and
full
of
ambition
a
more
vigorous
agent
for
the
execution
of
the
proposed
plan
of
conquest
could
not
have
been
desired
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
contrary
to
its
instinct
and
its
past
practice
resolved
in
view
of
the
greatness
of
the
stake
to
ask
this
time
for
help
from
the
and
vetch
sailed
for
england
bearing
an
address
to
the
queen
begging
for
an
armament
to
aid
in
the
reduction
of
canada
and
acadia
the
scheme
waxed
broader
yet
in
the
ardent
brain
of
the
agent
he
proposed
to
add
newfoundland
to
the
other
conquests
and
when
all
was
done
in
the
north
to
sail
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
wrest
pensacola
from
the
spaniards
by
which
means
he
writes
her
majesty
shall
be
sole
empress
of
the
vast
north
american
continent
the
idea
was
less
visionary
than
it
seems
energy
helped
by
reasonable
good
luck
might
easily
have
made
it
a
reality
so
far
as
concerned
the
possessions
of
france
the
court
granted
all
that
vetch
asked
on
the
eleventh
of
march
he
sailed
for
america
fully
empowered
to
carry
his
plans
into
execution
and
with
the
assurance
that
when
canada
was
conquered
he
should
be
its
governor
a
squadron
bearing
five
regiments
of
regular
troops
was
promised
the
colonies
were
to
muster
their
forces
in
all
haste
new
york
was
directed
to
furnish
eight
hundred
men
new
jersey
two
hundred
pennsylvania
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
connecticut
three
hundred
and
fifty
the
whole
to
be
at

by
the
middle
of
may
and
to
advance
on
montreal
by
way
of
wood
creek
and
lake
champlain
as
soon
as
they
should
hear
that
the
squadron
had
reached
boston
massachusetts
new
hampshire
and
rhode
island
were
to
furnish
twelve
hundred
men
to
join
the
regulars
in
attacking
quebec
by
way
of
the
st
lawrence
vetch
sailed
from
portsmouth
in
the
ship
dragon
accompanied
by
colonel
francis
nicholson
late
of
new
york
who
was
to
take
an
important
part
in
the
enterprise
the
squadron
with
the
five
regiments
was
to
follow
without
delay
the
weather
was
bad
and
the
dragon
beating
for
five
weeks
against
headwinds
did
not
enter
boston
harbor
till
the
evening
of
the
of
april
vetch
chafing
with
impatience
for
every
moment
was
precious
sent
off
expresses
that
same
night
to
carry
the
queen
letters
to
the
governors
of
rhode
island
connecticut
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
dudley
and
his
council
met
the
next
morning
and
to
them
vetch
delivered
the
royal
message
which
was
received
he
says
with
the
dutiful
obedience
becoming
good
subjects
and
all
the
marks
of
joy
and
thankfulness
vetch
nicholson
and
the
massachusetts
authorities
quickly
arranged
their
plans
an
embargo
was
laid
on
the
shipping
provision
was
made
for
raising
men
and
supplies
and
providing
transportation
when
all
was
in
train
the
two
emissaries
hired
a
sloop
for
new
york
and
touching
by
the
way
at
rhode
island
found
it
in
the
throes
of
the
annual
election
of
governor
yet
every
warlike
preparation
was
already
made
and
vetch
and
his
companion
sailed
at
once
for
new
haven
to
meet
saltonstall
the
newly
elected
governor
of
connecticut
here
too
all
was
ready
and
the
envoys
well
pleased
continued
their
voyage
to
new
york
which
they
reached
on
the
eighteenth
of
may
the
governor
lord
lovelace
had
lately
died
and
colonel
ingoldsby
the
acted
in
his
place
the
assembly
was
in
session
and
being
summoned
to
the
the
members
were
addressed
by
vetch
and
nicholson
with
excellent
effect
in
accepting
the
plan
of
conquest
new
york
completely
changed
front
she
had
thus
far
stood
neutral
leaving
her
neighbors
to
defend
themselves
and
carrying
on
an
active
trade
with
the
french
and
their
red
allies
still
it
was
her
interest
that
canada
should
become
english
thus
throwing
open
to
her
the
trade
of
the
western
tribes
and
the
promises
of
aid
from
england
made
the
prospects
of
the
campaign
so
flattering
that
she
threw
herself
into
the
enterprise
though
not
without
voices
of
protest
for
while
the
frontier
farmers
and
some
prominent
citizens
like
peter
schuyler
thought
that
the
time
for
action
had
come
the
albany
traders
and
their
allies
who
fattened
on
canadian
beaver
were
still
for
peace
at
any
price
with
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey
the
case
was
different
the
one
controlled
by
quakers
and
safe
from
french
refused
all
aid
while
the
other
in
less
degree
under
the
same
military
blight
would
give
no
men
though
granting
a
slow
and
reluctant
contribution
of
taking
care
to
suppress
on
the
record
every
indication
that
the
money
was
meant
for
military
uses
new
york
on
the
other
hand
raised
her
full
contingent
and
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
something
more
being
warm
in
the
faith
that
their
borders
would
be
plagued
with
no
longer
it
remained
for
new
york
to
gain
the
help
of
the
five
nations
of
the
iroquois
to
which
end
abraham
schuyler
went
to
onondaga
well
supplied
with
presents
the
iroquois
capital
was
now
as
it
had
been
for
years
divided
between
france
and
england
french
interests
were
represented
by
the
two
jesuits
mareuil
and
jacques
lamberville
the
skilful
management
of
schuyler
joined
to
his
gifts
and
his
rum
presently
won
over
so
many
to
the
english
party
and
raised
such
excitement
in
the
town
that
lamberville
thought
it
best
to
set
out
for
montreal
with
news
of
what
was
going
on
the
intrepid
joncaire
agent
of
france
among
the
senecas
was
scandalized
at
what
he
calls
the
jesuit
flight
and
wrote
to
the
commandant
of
fort
frontenac
that
its
effect
on
the
indians
was
such
that
he
joncaire
was
in
peril
of
his
life
yet
he
stood
his
ground
and
managed
so
well
that
he
held
the
senecas
firm
in
their
neutrality
lamberville
colleague
mareuil
whose
position
was
still
more
critical
was
persuaded
by
schuyler
that
his
only
safety
was
in
going
with
him
to
albany
which
he
did
and
on
this
the
onondagas
excited
by
rum
plundered
and
burned
the
jesuit
and
chapel
clearly
the
two
priests
at
onondaga
were
less
hungry
for
martyrdom
than
their
murdered
brethren
jogues
brébeuf
lalemant
and
charles
garnier
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
canadian
jesuit
of
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
before
all
things
an
apostle
and
his
successor
of
a
century
later
was
before
all
things
a
political
agent
as
for
the
five
nations
that
once
haughty
confederacy
in
spite
of
divisions
and
waverings
had
conceived
the
idea
that
its
true
policy
lay
not
in
siding
with
either
of
the
european
rivals
but
in
making
itself
important
to
both
and
courted
and
caressed
by
both
while
some
of
the
warriors
sang
the
at
the
prompting
of
schuyler
they
had
been
but
in
doing
so
and
even
the
mohawks
nearest
neighbors
and
best
friends
of
the
english
sent
word
to
their
canadian
kindred
the
caughnawagas
that
they
took
up
the
hatchet
only
because
they
could
not
help
it
the
attack
on
canada
by
way
of
the
hudson
and
lake
champlain
was
to
have
been
commanded
by
lord
lovelace
or
some
officer
of
his
choice
but
as
he
was
dead
ingoldsby
his
successor
in
the
government
of
the
province
jointly
with
the
governors
of
several
adjacent
colonies
who
had
met
at
new
york
appointed
colonel
nicholson
in
his
stead
nicholson
went
to
albany
whence
with
about
fifteen
hundred
men
he
moved
up
the
hudson
built
a
stockade
fort
opposite
saratoga
and
another
at
the
spot
known
as
the
great
carrying
place
this
latter
he
called
fort
nicholson
a
name
which
it
afterwards
exchanged
for
that
of
fort
lydius
and
later
still
for
that
of
fort
edward
which
the
town
that
occupies
the
site
owns
to
this
day
thence
he
cut
a
rough
roadway
through
the
woods
to
where
wood
creek
choked
with
beaver
dams
writhed
through
flat
green
meadows
walled
in
by
rock
and
forest
here
he
built
another
fort
which
was
afterwards
rebuilt
and
named
fort
anne
wood
creek
led
to
lake
champlain
and
lake
champlain
to
chambly
and
montreal
the
objective
points
of
the
expedition
all
was
astir
at
the
camp
and
canoes
were
made
and
stores
brought
up
from
albany
till
everything
was
ready
for
an
advance
the
moment
word
should
come
that
the
british
fleet
had
reached
boston
vetch
all
impatience
went
thither
to
meet
it
as
if
his
presence
could
hasten
its
arrival
reports
of

to

had
reached

and
vaudreuil
sent
ramesay
governor
of
montreal
with
fifteen
hundred
troops
canadians
and
indians
to
surprise
his
camp
ramesay
fleet
of
canoes

and
was
halfway
to
the
mouth
of

creek
when
his
advance
party
was
discovered
by
english
scouts
and
the
french
commander
began
to
fear
that
he
should
be
surprised
in
his
turn
in
fact
some
of
his
indians
were
fired
upon
from
an
ambuscade
all
was
now
doubt
perplexity
and
confusion
ramesay
landed
at
the
narrows
of
the
lake
a
little
south
of
the
place
now
called
crown
point
here
in
the
dense
woods
his
indians
fired
on
some
canadians
whom
they
took
for
english
this
was
near
producing
a
panic
every
tree
seemed
an
enemy
writes
an
officer
present
ramesay
lost
himself
in
the
woods
and
could
not
find
his
army
one
deruisseau
who
had
gone
out
as
a
scout
came
back
with
the
report
that
nine
hundred
englishmen
were
close
at
hand
seven
english
canoes
did
in
fact
appear
supported
as
the
french
in
their
excitement
imagined
by
a
numerous
though
invisible
army
in
the
forest
but
being
fired
upon
and
seeing
that
they
were
entering
a
hornet
nest
the
english
sheered
off
ramesay
having
at
last
found
his
army
and
order
being
gradually
restored
a
council
of
war
was
held
after
which
the
whole
force
fell
back
to
chambly
having
accomplished
nothing
great
was
the
alarm
in
canada
when
it
became
known
that
the
enemy
aimed
at
nothing
less
than
the
conquest
of
the
colony
one
la
plaine
spread
a
panic
at
quebec
by
reporting
that
leagues
below
he
had
seen
eight
or
ten
ships
under
sail
and
heard
the
sound
of
cannon
it
was
afterwards
surmised
that
the
supposed
ships
were
points
of
rocks
seen
through
the
mist
at
low
tide
and
the
cannon
the
floundering
of
whales
at
play
quebec
however
was
all
excitement
in
expectation
of
attack
the
people
of
the
lower
town
took
refuge
on
the
rock
above
the
men
of
the
neighboring
parishes
were
ordered
within
the
walls
and
the
women
and
children
with
the
cattle
and
horses
were
sent
to
in
the
forest
there
had
been
no
less
consternation
at
montreal
caused
by
exaggerated
reports
of
iroquois
hostility
and
the
movements
of
nicholson
it
was
even
proposed
to
abandon
chambly
and
fort
frontenac
and
concentrate
all
available
force
to
defend
the
heart
of
the
colony
a
most
bloody
war
is
imminent
wrote
vaudreuil
to
the
minister
ponchartrain
meanwhile
for
weeks
and
months
nicholson
little
army
lay
in
the
sultry
valley
of
wood
creek
waiting
those
tidings
of
the
arrival
of
the
british
squadron
at
boston
which
were
to
be
its
signal
of
advance
at
length
a
pestilence
broke
out
it
is
said
to
have
been
the
work
of
the
iroquois
allies
who
thought
that
the
french
were
menaced
with
ruin
and
who
true
to
their
policy
of
balancing
one
european
power
against
the
other
poisoned
the
waters
of
the
creek
by
throwing
into
it
above
the
camp
the
skins
and
offal
of
the
animals
they
had
killed
in
their
hunting
the
story
may
have
some
foundation
though
it
rests
only
on
the
authority
of
charlevoix
no
contemporary
writer
mentions
it
and
vaudreuil
says
that
the
malady
was
caused
by
the
long
confinement
of
the
english
in
their
fort
indeed
a
crowd
of
men
penned
up
through
the
heats
of
midsummer
in
a
palisaded
camp
and
unclean
as
the
camps
of
the
raw
provincials
usually
were
and
infested
with
pestiferous
swarms
of
flies
and
mosquitoes
could
hardly
have
remained
in
health
whatever
its
cause
the
disease
which
seems
to
have
been
a
malignant
dysentery
made
more
havoc
than
the
musket
and
the
sword
a
party
of
french
who
came
to
the
spot
late
in
the
autumn
found
it
filled
with
innumerable
graves
the
british
squadron
with
the
five
regiments
on
board
was
to
have
reached
boston
at
the
middle
of
may
on
the
twentieth
of
that
month
the
whole
contingent
of
massachusetts
new
hampshire
and
rhode
island
was
encamped
by
boston
harbor
with
transports
and
stores
ready
to
embark
for
quebec
at
ten
hours
notice
when
vetch
after
seeing
everything
in
readiness
at
new
york
returned
to
boston
on
the
third
of
july
he
found
the
new
england
levies
encamped
there
still
drilled
diligently
every
day
by
officers
whom
he
had
brought
from
england
for
the
purpose
the
bodies
of
the
men
he
writes
to
lord
sunderland
are
in
general
better
than
in
europe
and
i
hope
their
courage
will
prove
so
too
so
that
nothing
in
human
probability
can
prevent
the
success
of
this
glorious
enterprise
but
the
too
late
arrival
of
the
fleet
but
of
the
fleet
there
was
no
sign
the
government
here
is
put
to
vast
expense
pursues
vetch
but
they
cheerfully
pay
it
in
hopes
of
being
freed
from
it
forever
hereafter
all
that
they
can
do
now
is
to
fast
and
pray
for
the
safe
and
speedy
arrival
of
the
fleet
for
which
they
have
already
had
two
public
kept
if
it
should
not
come
in
time
he
continues
it
would
be
the
last
disappointment
to
her
majesty
colonies
who
have
so
heartily
complied
with
her
royal
order
and
would
render
them
much
more
miserable
than
if
such
a
thing
had
never
been
undertaken
time
passed
and
no
ships
appeared
vetch
wrote
again
i
shall
only
presume
to
acquaint
your
lordship
how
vastly
uneasy
all
her
majesty
loyall
subjects
here
on
this
continent
are
pray
god
hasten
the
fleet
dudley
scarcely
less
impatient
wrote
to
the
same
effect
it
was
all
in
vain
and
the
soldiers
remained
in
their
camp
monotonously
drilling
day
after
day
through
all
the
summer
and
half
the
autumn
at
length
on
the
eleventh
of
october
dudley
received
a
letter
from
lord
sunderland
informing
him
that
the
promised
forces
had
been
sent
to
portugal
to
meet
an
exigency
of
the
european
war
they
were
to
have
reached
boston
as
we
have
seen
by
the
middle
of
may
sunderland
notice
of
the
change
of
destination
was
not
written
till
the
of
july
and
was
eleven
weeks
on
its
way
thus
imposing
on
the
colonists
a
heavy
and
needless
tax
in
time
money
temper
and
in
the
case
of
the
expedition
against
montreal
health
and
life
what
was
left
of
nicholson
force
had
fallen
back
before
sunderland
letter
came
making
a
scapegoat
of
the
innocent
vetch
cursing
him
and
wishing
him
hanged
in
new
england
the
disappointment
and
vexation
were
extreme
but
not
to
lose
all
the
fruits
of
their
efforts
the
governors
of
massachusetts
connecticut
new
hampshire
and
rhode
island
met
and
resolved
to
attack
port
royal
if
the
captains
of
several
british
frigates
then
at
new
york
and
boston
would
take
part
in
the
enterprise
to
the
disgust
of
the
provincials
the
captains
with
one
exception
refused
on
the
score
of
the
late
season
and
the
want
of
orders
a
tenacious
energy
has
always
been
a
characteristic
of
new
england
and
the
hopes
of
the
colonists
had
been
raised
too
high
to
be
readily
abandoned
port
royal
was
in
their
eyes
a
pestilent
nest
of
privateers
and
pirates
that
preyed
on
the
new
england
fisheries
and
on
the
refusal
of
the
naval
commanders
to
join
in
an
immediate
attack
they
offered
to
the
court
to
besiege
the
place
themselves
next
year
if
they
could
count
on
the
help
of
four
frigates
and
five
hundred
soldiers
to
be
at
boston
by
the
end
of
march
the
assembly
of
massachusetts
requested
nicholson
who
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
for
europe
to
beg
her
majesty
to
help
them
in
an
enterprise
which
would
be
so
advantageous
to
the
crown
and
which
by
the
long
and
expensive
war
we
are
so
impoverished
and
enfeebled
as
not
to
be
in
a
capacity
to
effect
nicholson
sailed
in
december
and
peter
schuyler
soon
followed
new
york
having
once
entered
on
the
path
of
war
saw
that
she
must
continue
in
it
and
to
impress
the
five
nations
with
the
might
and
majesty
of
the
queen
and
so
dispose
them
to
hold
fast
to
the
british
cause
schuyler
took
five
mohawk
chiefs
with
him
to
england
one
died
on
the
voyage
the
rest
arrived
safe
and
their
appearance
was
the
sensation
of
the
hour
they
were
clad
at
the
queen
expense
in
strange
and
gay
attire
invented
by
the
costumer
of
one
of
the
theatres
were
lodged
and
feasted
as
the
guests
of
the
nation
driven
about
london
in
coaches
with
liveried
servants
conducted
to
dockyards
arsenals
and
reviews
and
saluted
with
cannon
by
ships
of
war
the
duke
of
shrewsbury
presented
them
to
queen
anne
one
as
emperor
of
the
mohawks
and
the
other
three
as
kings
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
solemnly
gave
each
of
them
a
bible
steele
and
addison
wrote
essays
about
them
and
the
dutch
artist
verelst
painted
their
portraits
which
were
engraved
in
mezzotint
their
presence
and
the
speech
made
in
their
name
before
the
court
seem
to
have
had
no
small
effect
in
drawing
attention
to
the
war
in
america
and
inclining
the
ministry
towards
the
proposals
of
nicholson
these
were
accepted
and
he
sailed
for
america
commissioned
to
command
the
enterprise
against
port
royal
with
vetch
as
colonel
francis
nicholson
had
held
some
modest
military
positions
but
never
it
is
said
seen
active
service
in
colonial
affairs
he
had
played
an
important
part
and
in
the
course
of
his
life
governed
at
different
times
virginia
new
york
maryland
and
carolina
he
had
a
robust
practical
brain
capable
of
broad
views
and
large
schemes
one
of
his
plans
was
a
confederacy
of
the
provinces
to
resist
the
french
which
to
his
great
indignation
virginia
rejected
he
had
jacobite
leanings
and
had
been
an
adherent
of
james
ii
but
being
no
idealist
and
little
apt
to
let
his
political
principles
block
the
path
of
his
interests
he
turned
his
back
on
the
fallen
cause
and
offered
his
services
to
the
revolution
though
no
pattern
of
domestic
morals
he
seems
to
have
been
officially
upright
and
he
wished
well
to
the
colonies
saving
always
the
dominant
interests
of
england
he
was
bold
ambitious
vehement
and
sometimes
headstrong
and
perverse
though
the
english
ministry
had
promised
aid
it
was
long
in
coming
the
massachusetts
assembly
had
asked
that
the
ships
should
be
at
boston
before
the
end
of
march
but
it
was
past
the
middle
of
may
before
they
sailed
from
plymouth
then
towards
midsummer
a
strange
spasm
of
martial
energy
seems
to
have
seized
the
ministry
for
viscount
shannon
was
ordered
to
boston
with
an
additional
force
commissioned
to
take
the
chief
command
and
attack
not
port
royal
but
quebec
this
change
of
plan
seems
to
have
been
reconsidered
at
least
it
came
to
nothing
meanwhile
the
new
england
people
waited
impatiently
for
the
retarded
ships
no
order
had
come
from
england
for
raising
men
and
the
colonists
resolved
this
time
to
risk
nothing
till
assured
that
their
labor
and
money
would
not
be
wasted
at
last
not
in
march
but
in
july
the
ships
appeared
then
all
was
astir
with
preparation
first
the
house
of
representatives
voted
thanks
to
the
queen
for
her
royal
aid
next
it
was
proclaimed
that
no
vessel
should
be
permitted
to
leave
the
harbor
till
the
service
is
provided
and
a
committee
of
the
house
proceeded
to
impress
fourteen
vessels
to
serve
as
transports
then
a
vote
was
passed
that
nine
hundred
men
be
raised
as
the
quota
of
massachusetts
and
a
month
pay
in
advance
together
with
a
coat
worth
thirty
shillings
was
promised
to
volunteers
a
committee
of
three
being
at
the
same
time
appointed
to
provide
the
coats
on
the
next
day
appeared
a
proclamation
from
the
governor
announcing
the
aforesaid
encouragements
calling
on
last
year
soldiers
to
enlist
again
promising
that
all
should
return
home
as
soon
as
port
royal
was
taken
and
that
each
might
keep
as
his
own
forever
the
queen
musket
that
would
be
furnished
him
now
came
an
order
to
colonels
of
militia
to
muster
their
regiments
on
a
day
named
read
the
proclamation
at
the
head
of
each
company
and
if
volunteers
did
not
come
forward
in
sufficient
number
to
draft
as
many
men
as
might
be
wanted
appointing
at
the
same
time
officers
to
conduct
them
to
the
rendezvous
at
dorchester
or
cambridge
and
by
a
stringent
and
unusual
enactment
the
house
ordered
that
they
should
be
quartered
in
private
houses
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
owners
any
law
or
usage
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
sailors
were
impressed
without
ceremony
to
man
the
transports
and
finally
it
was
voted
that
a
pipe
of
wine
twenty
sheep
five
pigs
and
one
hundred
fowls
be
presented
to
the
honorable
general
nicholson
for
his
table
during
the
expedition
the
above
with
slight
variation
may
serve
as
an
example
of
the
manner
in
which
for
several
generations
men
were
raised
in
massachusetts
to
serve
against
the
french
autumn
had
begun
before
all
was
ready
connecticut
new
hampshire
and
rhode
island
sent
their
contingents
there
was
a
dinner
at
the
green
dragon
tavern
in
honor
of
nicholson
vetch
and
sir
charles
hobby
the
chief
officers
of
the
expedition
and
on
the
eighteenth
of
september
the
whole
put
to
sea
on
the
the
squadron
sailed
into
the
narrow
entrance
of
port
royal
where
the
tide
runs
like
a
one
vessel
was
driven
upon
the
rocks
and
men
were
drowned
the
others
got
in
safely
and
anchored
above
goat
island
in
sight
of
the
french
fort
they
consisted
of
three
the
dragon
the
chester
and
the
falmouth
two
the
lowestoffe
and
the
feversham
the
province
galley
one
small
transports
two
or
three
hospital
ships
a
tender
and
several
sloops
carrying
timber
to
make
beds
for
cannon
and
mortars
the
landing
force
consisted
of
four
hundred
british
marines
and
about
fifteen
hundred
provincials
divided
into
four
battalions
its
unnecessary
numbers
were
due
to
the
belief
of
nicholson
that
the
fort
had
been
reinforced
and
strengthened
in
the
afternoon
of
the
they
were
all
on
shore
vetch
with
his
two
battalions
on
the
north
side
and
nicholson
with
the
other
two
on
the
south
vetch
marched
to
his
on
which
in
the
words
of
nicholson
journal
the
french
began
to
fire
pretty
thick
on
the
next
morning
nicholson
men
moved
towards
the
fort
hacking
their
way
through
the
woods
and
crossing
the
marshes
of
allen
river
while
the
french
fired
briskly
with
cannon
from
the
ramparts
and
from
the
woods
houses
and
fences
they
were
driven
back
and
the
english
advance
guard
intrenched
itself
within
four
hundred
yards
of
the
works
several
days
passed
in
landing
artillery
and
stores
cannonading
from
the
fort
and
shelling
from
the
english
when
on
the
ensign
perelle
with
a
drummer
and
a
flag
of
truce
came
to
nicholson
tent
bringing
a
letter
from
subercase
who
begged
him
to
receive
into
his
camp
and
under
his
protection
certain
ladies
of
the
fort
who
were
distressed
by
the
bursting
of
the
english
shells
the
conduct
of
perelle
was
irregular
as
he
had
not
given
notice
of
his
approach
by
beat
of
drum
and
got
himself
and
attendants
blindfolded
before
entering
the
camp
therefore
nicholson
detained
him
sending
back
an
officer
of
his
own
with
a
letter
to
the
effect
that
he
would
receive
the
ladies
and
lodge
them
in
the
same
house
with
the
french
ensign
for
the
queen
my
royal
mistress
hath
not
sent
me
hither
to
make
war
against
women
subercase
on
his
part
detained
the
english
officer
and
wrote
to
nicholson
sir
you
have
one
of
my
officers
and
i
have
one
of
yours
so
that
now
we
are
equal
however
that
hinders
me
not
from
believing
that
once
you
have
given
me
your
word
you
will
keep
it
very
exactly
on
that
ground
i
now
write
to
tell
you
sir
that
to
prevent
the
spilling
of
both
english
and
french
blood
i
am
ready
to
hold
up
both
hands
for
a
capitulation
that
will
be
honorable
to
both
of
us
in
view
of
which
agreement
he
adds
that
he
defers
sending
the
ladies
to
the
english

were

to

gave
up
the

the

marched
out

consisted
of
two

two
hundred
and
fifty
provincials
who
had
offered
themselves
for

the

sir

took

followed

as

the

could
hardly
have
been

the
french

in

when
it
was
taken
were
but
two
hundred
and
some
of

many
of

no

a
fact
too
novel
and
surprising
to
escape
the
notice
either
of
friends
or
of
foes
the
latter
drew
strange
conclusions
from
it
two
irish
deserters
from
an
english
station
in
newfoundland
appeared
at
the
french
post
of
placentia
full
of
stories
of
british
and
provincial
armaments
against
canada
on
this
an
idea
seized
the
french
commandant
costebelle
and
he
hastened
to
make
it
known
to
the
colonial
minister
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
aim
of
england
was
not
so
much
to
conquer
the
french
colonies
as
to
reduce
her
own
to
submission
especially
massachusetts
a
kind
of
republic
which
has
never
willingly
accepted
a
governor
from
its
king
in
sending
ships
and
soldiers
to
the
bastonnais
under
pretence
of
helping
them
to
conquer
their
french
neighbors
costebelle
is
sure
that
england
only
means
to
bring
them
to
a
dutiful
subjection
i
do
not
think
he
writes
on
another
occasion
that
they
are
so
blind
as
not
to
see
that
they
will
insensibly
be
brought
under
the
yoke
of
the
parliament
of
old
england
but
by
the
cruelties
that
the
canadians
and
indians
exercise
in
continual
incursions
upon
their
lands
i
judge
that
they
would
rather
be
delivered
from
the
inhumanity
of
such
neighbors
than
preserve
all
the
former
powers
of
their
little
republic
he
thinks
however
that
the
design
of
england
ought
to
be
strongly
represented
to
the
council
at
boston
and
that
de
la
ronde
denys
will
be
a
good
man
to
do
it
as
he
speaks
english
has
lived
in
boston
and
has
many
acquaintances
there
the
minister
ponchartrain
was
struck
by
costebelle
suggestion
and
wrote
both
to
him
and
to
vaudreuil
in
high
approval
of
it
to
vaudreuil
he
says
monsieur
de
costebelle
has
informed
me
that
the
chief
object
of
the
armament
made
by
the
english
last
year
was
to
establish
their
sovereignty
at
boston
and
new
york
the
people
of
these
provinces
having
always
maintained
a
sort
of
republic
governed
by
their
council
and
having
been
unwilling
to
receive
absolute
governors
from
the
kings
of
england
this
destination
of
the
armament
seems
to
me
probable
and
it
is
much
to
be
wished
that
the
council
at
boston
could
be
informed
of
the
designs
of
the
english
court
and
shown
how
important
it
is
for
that
province
to
remain
in
the
state
of
a
republic
the
king
would
even
approve
our
helping
it
to
do
so
if
you
see
any
prospect
of
success
no
means
should
be
spared
to
secure
it
the
matter
is
of
the
greatest
importance
but
care
is
essential
to
employ
persons
who
have
the
talents
necessary
for
conducting
it
besides
great
secrecy
and
prudence
as
well
as
tried
probity
and
fidelity
this
affair
demands
your
best
attention
and
must
be
conducted
with
great
care
and
precaution
in
order
that
no
false
step
may
be
taken
ponchartrain
could
not
be
supposed
to
know
that
while
under
her
old
charter
massachusetts
called
by
him
and
other
frenchmen
the
government
of
boston
had
chosen
her
own
governor
new
york
had
always
received
hers
from
the
court
what
is
most
curious
in
this
affair
is
the
attitude
of
louis
who
abhorred
republics
and
yet
was
prepared
to
bolster
up
one
or
more
of
them
beyond
the
atlantic
thinking
no
doubt
that
they
would
be
too
small
and
remote
to
be
dangerous
costebelle
who
had
suggested
the
plan
of
warning
the
council
at
boston
proceeded
to
unfold
his
scheme
for
executing
it
this
was
to
send
la
ronde
denys
to
boston
in
the
spring
under
the
pretext
of
treating
for
an
exchange
of
prisoners
which
would
give
him
an
opportunity
of
insinuating
to
the
colonists
that
the
forces
which
the
queen
of
england
sends
to
join
their
own
for
the
conquest
of
acadia
and
canada
have
no
object
whatever
but
that
of
ravishing
from
them
the
liberties
they
have
kept
so
firmly
and
so
long
but
which
would
be
near
ruin
if
the
queen
should
become
mistress
of
new
france
by
the
fortune
of
war
and
that
either
they
must
have
sadly
fallen
from
their
ancient
spirit
or
their
chiefs
have
been
corrupted
by
the
court
of
london
if
they
do
not
see
that
they
are
using
their
own
weapons
for
the
destruction
of
their
republic
la
ronde
denys
accordingly
received
his
instructions
which
authorized
him
to
negotiate
with
the
bastonnais
as
with
an
independent
people
and
offer
them
complete
exemption
from
french
hostility
if
they
would
promise
to
give
no
more
aid
to
old
england
either
in
ships
or
men
he
was
told
at
the
same
time
to
approach
the
subject
with
great
caution
and
unless
he
found
willing
listeners
to
pass
off
the
whole
as
a
pleasantry
he
went
to
boston
where
he
was
detained
in
consequence
of
preparations
then
on
foot
for
attacking
canada
he
tried
to
escape
but
his
vessel
was
seized
and
moored
under
the
guns
of
the
town
and
it
is
needless
to
say
that
his
mission
was
a
failure
the
idea
of
costebelle
or
rather
of
la
ronde
for
it
probably
originated
with
him
was
not
without
foundation
for
though
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
in
sending
ships
and
soldiers
against
the
french
england
meant
to
use
them
against
the
liberties
of
her
own
colonies
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
she
thought
those
liberties
excessive
and
troublesome
and
on
the
other
side
while
the
people
of
massachusetts
were
still
fondly
attached
to
the
land
of
their
fathers
and
still
called
it
home
they
were
at
the
same
time
enamoured
of
their
autonomy
and
jealously
watchful
against
any
abridgment
of
it
while
la
ronde
denys
was
warning
massachusetts
of
the
danger
of
helping
england
to
conquer
canada
another
frenchman
in
a
more
prophetic
spirit
declared
that
england
would
make
a
grave
mistake
if
she
helped
her
colonies
to
the
same
end
there
is
an
antipathy
this
writer
affirms
between
the
english
of
europe
and
those
of
america
who
will
not
endure
troops
from
england
even
to
guard
their
forts
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
if
the
french
colonies
should
fall
those
of
england
would
control
the
continent
from
newfoundland
to
florida
old
england
such
are
his
words
will
not
imagine
that
these
various
provinces
will
then
unite
shake
off
the
yoke
of
the
english
monarchy
and
erect
themselves
into
a
democracy
forty
or
fifty
years
later
several
frenchmen
made
the
same
prediction
but
at
this
early
day
when
the
british
provinces
were
so
feeble
and
divided
it
is
truly
a
remarkable
one
the
anonymous
prophet
regards
the
colonies
of
england
massachusetts
above
all
as
a
standing
menace
to
those
of
france
and
he
proposes
a
drastic
remedy
against
the
danger
this
is
a
powerful
attack
on
boston
by
land
and
sea
for
which
he
hopes
that
god
will
prepare
the
way
when
boston
is
reduced
we
would
call
together
all
the
chief
men
of
the
other
towns
of
new
england
who
would
pay
heavy
sums
to
be
spared
from
the
flames
as
for
boston
it
should
be
pillaged
its
workshops
manufactures
shipyards
all
its
fine
establishments
ruined
and
its
ships
sunk
if
these
gentle
means
are
used
thoroughly
he
thinks
that
new
england
will
cease
to
be
a
dangerous
rival
for
some
time
especially
if
rhodelene
rhode
island
is
treated
like
boston
while
the
correspondent
of
the
french
court
was
thus
consigning
new
england
to
destruction
an
attack
was
preparing
against
canada
less
truculent
but
quite
as
formidable
as
that
which
he
urged
against
boston
the
french
colony
was
threatened
by
an
armament
stronger
in
proportion
to
her
present
means
of
defence
than
that
which
brought
her
under
british
rule
half
a
century
later
but
here
all
comparison
ceases
for
there
was
no
pitt
to
direct
and
inspire
and
no
wolfe
to
lead
the
letters
of
dudley
the
proposals
of
vetch
the
representations
of
nicholson
the
promptings
of
jeremiah
dummer
agent
of
massachusetts
in
england
and
the
speech
made
to
the
queen
by
the
four
indians
who
had
been
the
london
sensation
of
the
last
year
had
all
helped
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
ministry
to
the
new
world
and
the
expediency
of
driving
the
french
out
of
it
other
influences
conspired
to
the
same
end
or
in
all
likelihood
little
or
nothing
would
have
been
done
england
was
tiring
of
the
continental
war
the
costs
of
which
threatened
ruin
marlborough
was
rancorously
attacked
and
his
most
stanch
supporters
the
whigs
had
given
place
to
the
tories
led
by
the
lord
treasurer
harley
and
the
secretary
of
state
john
soon
afterwards
lord
bolingbroke
never
was
party
spirit
more
bitter
and
the
new
ministry
found
a
congenial
ally
in
the
coarse
and
savage
but
powerful
genius
of
swift
who
incensed
by
real
or
imagined
slights
from
the
late
minister
godolphin
gave
all
his
strength
to
the
winning
side
the
prestige
of
marlborough
victories
was
still
immense
harley
and
john
dreaded
it
as
their
chief
danger
and
looked
eagerly
for
some
means
of
counteracting
it
such
means
would
be
supplied
by
the
conquest
of
new
france
to
make
america
a
british
continent
would
be
an
achievement
almost
worth
blenheim
or
ramillies
and
one
too
in
which
britain
alone
would
be
the
gainer
whereas
the
enemies
of
marlborough
with
swift
at
their
head
contended
that
his
greatest
triumphs
turned
more
to
the
profit
of
holland
or
germany
than
of
england
moreover
to
send
a
part
of
his
army
across
the
atlantic
would
tend
to
cripple
his
movements
and
diminish
his
fame
john
entered
with
ardor
into
the
scheme
seven
veteran
regiments
five
of
which
were
from
the
army
in
flanders
were
ordered
to
embark
but
in
the
choice
of
commanders
the
judgment
of
the
ministers
was
not
left
free
there
were
influences
that
they
could
not
disregard
the
famous
sarah
duchess
of
marlborough
lately
the
favorite
of
the
feeble
but
wilful
queen
had
lost
her
good
graces
and
given
place
to
masham
one
of
the
women
of
her
bedchamber
the
new
favorite
had
a
brother
john
hill
known
about
the
court
as
jack
hill
whom
marlborough
had
pronounced
good
for
nothing
but
who
had
been
advanced
to
the
rank
of
colonel
and
then
of
brigadier
through
the
influence
of
masham
and
though
his
agreeable
social
qualities
were
his
best
recommendation
he
was
now
appointed
to
command
the
troops
on
the
canada
expedition
it
is
not
so
clear
why
the
naval
command
was
given
to
admiral
sir
hovenden
walker
a
man
whose
incompetence
was
soon
to
become
notorious
extreme
care
was
taken
to
hide
the
destination
of
the
fleet
even
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
were
kept
ignorant
of
it
some
thought
the
ships
bound
for
the
west
indies
some
for
the
south
sea
nicholson
was
sent
to
america
with
orders
to
the
several
colonies
to
make
ready
men
and
supplies
he
landed
at
boston
on
the
eighth
of
june
the
people
of
the
town
who
were
nearly
all
whigs
were
taken
by
surprise
expecting
no
such
enterprise
on
the
part
of
the
tory
ministry
and
their
perplexity
was
not
diminished
when
they
were
told
that
the
fleet
was
at
hand
and
that
they
were
to
supply
it
forthwith
with
provisions
for
ten
weeks
there
was
no
time
to
lose
the
governors
of
new
york
connecticut
and
rhode
island
were
summoned
to
meet
at
new
london
and
dudley
and
nicholson
went
thither
to
join
them
here
plans
were
made
for
the
double
attack
for
while
walker
and
hill
were
to
sail
up
the
lawrence
against
quebec
nicholson
as
in
the
former
attempt
was
to
move
against
montreal
by
way
of
lake
champlain
in
a
few
days
the
arrangements
were
made
and
the
governors
hastened
back
to
their
respective
posts
when
dudley
reached
boston
he
saw
nantasket
roads
crowded
with
transports
and
ships
of
war
and
the
pastures
of
noddle
island
studded
with
tents
the
fleet
had
come
on
the
having
had
what
the
admiral
calls
by
the
blessing
of
god
a
favorable
and
extraordinary
passage
being
but
seven
weeks
and
two
days
between
plymouth
and
nantasket
the
admiral
and
the
general
had
been
welcomed
with
all
honor
the
provincial
secretary
with
two
members
of
the
council
conducted
them
to
town
amid
salutes
from
the
batteries
of
copp
hill
and
fort
hill
and
the
boston
militia
regiment
received
them
under
arms
after
which
they
were
feasted
at
the
principal
tavern
and
accompanied
in
ceremony
to
the
lodgings
provided
for
them
when
the
troops
were
disembarked
and
the
tents
pitched
curious
townspeople
and
staring
rustics
crossed
to
noddle
island
now
east
boston
to
gaze
with
wonder
on
a
military
pageant
the
like
of
which
new
england
had
never
seen
before
yet
their
joy
at
this
succor
was
dashed
with
deep
distrust
and
jealousy
they
dreaded
these
new
and
formidable
friends
with
their
imperious
demeanor
and
exacting
demands
the
british
officers
on
their
part
were
no
better
pleased
with
the
colonists
and
one
of
them
colonel
king
of
the
artillery
thus
gives
vent
to
his
feelings
find
in
my
journal
what
difficultyes
we
mett
with
through
the
misfortune
that
the
coloneys
were
not
inform
of
our
coming
two
months
sooner
and
through
the
interestedness
ill
nature
and
sowerness
of
these
people
whose
government
doctrine
and
manners
whose
hypocracy
and
canting
are
insupportable
and
no
man
living
but
one
of
hill
good
sense
and
good
nature
could
have
managed
them
but
if
such
a
man
mett
with
nothing
he
could
depend
on
altho
vested
with
the
queen
royal
power
and
authority
and
supported
by
a
number
of
troops
sufficient
to
reduce
by
force
all
the
coloneys
is
easy
to
determine
the
respect
and
obedience
her
majesty
may
reasonably
expect
from
them
and
he
gives
it
as
his
conviction
that
till
all
the
colonies
are
deprived
of
their
charters
and
brought
under
one
government
they
will
grow
more
stiff
and
disobedient
every
day
it
will
be
seen
that
some
coolness
on
the
part
of
the
bostonians
was
not
unnatural
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
popular
feeling
the
provincial
authorities
did
their
full
part
towards
supplying
the
needs
of
the
for
dudley
with
his
strong
tory
leanings
did
not
share
the
prevailing
jealousy
and
the
country
members
of
the
assembly
were
anxious
before
all
things
to
be
delivered
from
the
problem
was
how
to
raise
the
men
and
furnish
the
supplies
in
the
least
possible
time
the
action
of
the
assembly
far
from
betraying
any
slackness
was
worthy
of
a
military
dictatorship
all
ordinary
business
was
set
aside
bills
of
credit
for
were
issued
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
expedition
it
was
ordered
that
the
prices
of
provisions
and
other
necessaries
of
the
service
should
stand
fixed
at
the
point
where
they
stood
before
the
approach
of
the
fleet
was
known
sheriffs
and
constables
jointly
with
the
queen
officers
were
ordered
to
search
all
the
town
for
provisions
and
liquors
and
if
the
owners
refused
to
part
with
them
at
the
prescribed
prices
to
break
open
doors
and
seize
them
stringent
and
acts
were
passed
against
harboring
deserters
provincial
troops
in
greater
number
than
the
ministry
had
demanded
were
ordered
to
be
raised
at
once
and
quartered
upon
the
citizens
with
or
without
their
consent
at
the
rate
of
eightpence
a
day
for
each
man
warrants
were
issued
for
impressing
pilots
and
also
mechanics
and
laborers
who
in
spite
of
puritan
scruples
were
required
to
work
on
sundays
such
measures
if
imposed
by
england
would
have
roused
the
most
bitter
resentment
even
when
ordered
by
their
own
representatives
they
caused
a
sullen
discontent
among
the
colonists
and
greatly
increased
the
popular
dislike
of
their
military
visitors
it
was
certain
that
when
the
expedition
sailed
and
the
operation
of
the
new
enactments
ceased
prices
would
rise
and
hence
the
compulsion
to
part
with
goods
at
low
fixed
rates
was
singularly
trying
to
the
commercial
temper
it
was
a
busy
season
too
with
the
farmers
and
they
showed
no
haste
to
bring
their
produce
to
the
camp
though
many
of
the
principal
inhabitants
bound
themselves
by
mutual
agreement
to
live
on
their
family
stores
of
salt
provisions
in
order
that
the
troops
might
be
better
supplied
with
fresh
this
failed
to
soothe
the
irritation
of
the
british
officers
aggravated
by
frequent
desertions
which
the
colonists
favored
and
by
the
impossibility
of
finding
pilots
familiar
with
the
lawrence
some
when
forced
into
the
service
made
their
escape
to
the
great
indignation
of
walker
who
wrote
to
the
governor
her
majesty
will
resent
such
actions
in
a
very
signal
manner
and
when
it
shall
be
represented
that
the
people
live
here
as
if
there
were
no
king
in
israel
but
every
one
does
what
seems
right
in
his
own
eyes
measures
will
be
taken
to
put
things
upon
a
better
foot
for
the
future
at
length
however
every
preparation
was
made
the
supplies
were
all
on
board
and
after
a
grand
review
of
the
troops
on
the
fields
of
noddle
island
the
whole
force
set
sail
on
the
thirtieth
of
july
the
provincials
wishing
them
success
and
heartily
rejoicing
that
they
were
gone
the
fleet
consisted
of
nine
ships
of
war
and
two
with
about
sixty
transports
and
other
vessels
british
and
provincial
they
carried
the
seven
british
regiments
numbering
with
the
artillery
train
about
hundred
men
besides
six
hundred
marines
and
fifteen
hundred
provincials
counting
with
the
sailors
nearly
twelve
thousand
in
all
vetch
commanded
the
provincials
having
been
brought
from
annapolis
for
that
purpose
the
great
need
was
of
pilots
every
sailor
in
new
england
who
had
seen
the
lawrence
had
been
pressed
into
the
service
though
each
and
all
declared
themselves
incapable
of
conducting
the
fleet
to
quebec
several
had
no
better
knowledge
of
the
river
than
they
had
picked
up
when
serving
as
soldiers
under
phips
years
before
the
best
among
them
was
the
veteran
captain
bonner
who
afterwards
amused
his
old
age
by
making
a
plan
of
boston
greatly
prized
by
connoisseurs
in
such
matters
vetch
had
studied
the
lawrence
in
his
several
visits
to
quebec
but
like
bonner
he
had
gone
up
the
river
only
in
sloops
or
other
small
craft
and
was
moreover
no
sailor
one
of
walker
ships
the
chester
sent
in
advance
to
cruise
in
the
gulf
had
captured
a
french
vessel
commanded
by
one
paradis
an
experienced
old
voyager
who
knew
the
river
well
he
took
a
bribe
of
five
hundred
pistoles
to
act
as
pilot
but
the
fleet
would
perhaps
have
fared
better
if
he
had
refused
the
money
he
gave
such
dismal
accounts
of
the
canadian
winter
that
the
admiral
could
see
nothing
but
ruin
ahead
even
if
he
should
safely
reach
his
destination
his
tribulation
is
recorded
in
his
journal
that
which
now
chiefly
took
up
my
thoughts
was
contriving
how
to
secure
the
ships
if
we
got
up
to
quebec
for
ice
in
the
river
freezing
to
the
would
have
utterly
destroyed
and
bilged
them
as
much
as
if
they
had
been
squeezed
between
rocks
these
misgivings
may
serve
to
give
the
measure
of
his
professional
judgment
afterwards
reflecting
on
the
situation
he
sees
cause
for
gratitude
in
his
own
mishaps
because
had
we
arrived
safe
at
quebec
our
provisions
would
have
been
reduced
to
a
very
small
proportion
not
exceeding
eight
or
nine
weeks
at
short
allowance
so
that
between
ten
and
twelve
thousand
men
must
have
been
left
to
perish
with
the
extremity
of
cold
and
hunger
i
must
confess
the
melancholy
contemplation
of
this
had
it
happened
strikes
me
with
horror
for
how
dismal
must
it
have
been
to
have
beheld
the
seas
and
earth
locked
up
by
adamantine
frosts
and
swoln
with
high
mountains
of
snow
in
a
barren
and
uncultivated
region
great
numbers
of
brave
men
famishing
with
hunger
and
drawing
lots
who
should
die
first
to
feed
the
rest
all
went
well
till
the
eighteenth
of
august
when
there
was
a
strong
and
the
ships
ran
into
the
bay
of
gaspé
two
days
after
the
wind
shifted
to
the
southeast
and
they
set
sail
again
walker
in
his
flagship
the
edgar
being
at
or
near
the
head
of
the
fleet
on
the
evening
of
the
they
were
at
some
distance
above
the
great
island
of
anticosti
the
river
is
here
about
seventy
miles
wide
and
no
land
had
been
seen
since
noon
of
the
day
before
there
was
a
strong
east
wind
with
fog
walker
thought
that
he
was
not
far
from
the
south
shore
when
in
fact
he
was
at
least
fifty
miles
from
it
and
more
than
half
that
distance
north
of
his
true
course
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
admiral
signalled
the
fleet
to
bring
to
under
mizzen
and
with
heads
turned
southward
at
ten
paddon
the
captain
of
the
edgar
came
to
tell
him
that
he
saw
land
which
he
supposed
must
be
the
south
shore
on
which
walker
in
a
fatal
moment
signalled
for
the
ships
to
wear
and
bring
to
with
heads
northward
he
then
turned
into
his
berth
and
was
falling
asleep
when
a
military
officer
captain
goddard
of
seymour
regiment
hastily
entered
and
begged
him
to
come
on
deck
saying
that
there
were
breakers
on
all
sides
walker
scornful
of
a
landsman
and
annoyed
at
being
disturbed
answered
impatiently
and
would
not
stir
soon
after
goddard
appeared
again
and
implored
him
for
heaven
sake
to
come
up
and
see
for
himself
or
all
would
be
lost
at
the
same
time
the
admiral
heard
a
great
noise
and
trampling
on
which
he
turned
out
of
his
berth
put
on
his
and
slippers
and
going
in
this
attire
on
deck
found
a
scene
of
fright
and
confusion
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
and
shouted
to
the
men
to
reassure
them
but
just
then
the
fog
opened
the
moon
shone
out
and
the
breaking
surf
was
plainly
visible
to
leeward
the
french
pilot
who
at
first
could
not
be
found
now
appeared
on
deck
and
declared
to
the
astonishment
of
both
the
admiral
and
captain
paddon
that
they
were
off
the
north
shore
paddon
in
his
perplexity
had
ordered
an
anchor
to
be
let
go
walker
directed
the
cable
to
be
cut
and
making
all
sail
succeeded
in
beating
to
windward
and
gaining
an
offing
the
ship
that
carried
colonel
king
of
the
artillery
had
a
narrow
escape
king
says
that
she
anchored
in
a
driving
rain
with
a
shoal
of
rocks
on
each
quarter
within
a
cable
length
of
us
which
we
plainly
perceived
by
the
waves
breaking
over
them
in
a
very
violent
manner
they
were
saved
by
a
lull
in
the
gale
for
if
it
had
continued
with
the
same
violence
he
pursues
our
anchors
could
not
have
held
and
the
wind
and
the
vast
seas
which
ran
would
have
broke
our
ship
into
ten
thousand
pieces
against
the
rocks
all
night
we
heard
nothing
but
ships
firing
and
showing
lights
as
in
the
utmost
distress
vetch
who
was
on
board
the
little
frigate
despatch
says
that
he
was
extremely
uneasy
at
the
course
taken
by
walker
on
the
night
of
the
storm
i
told
colonel
dudley
and
captain
perkins
commander
of
the
that
i
wondered
what
the
flag
meant
by
that
course
and
why
he
did
not
steer
west
and
the
despatch
kept
well
astern
and
so
escaped
the
danger
vetch
heard
through
the
fog
guns
firing
signals
of
distress
but
three
days
passed
before
he
knew
how
serious
the
disaster
was
the
ships
of
war
had
all
escaped
but
eight
british
transports
one
and
one
sutler
sloop
were
dashed
to
pieces
it
was
lamentable
to
hear
the
shrieks
of
the
sinking
drowning
departing
souls
writes
the
new
england
commissary
sheaf
who
was
very
near
sharing
their
fate
the
disaster
took
place
at
and
near
a
rocky
island
with
adjacent
reefs
lying
off
the
north
shore
and
called
isle
aux
oeufs
on
the
second
day
after
it
happened
walker
was
told
by
the
master
of
one
of
the
wrecked
transports
that
eight
hundred
and
soldiers
had
been
lost
and
he
gives
this
hasty
estimate
in
his
published
journal
though
he
says
in
his
introduction
to
it
that
the
total
loss
of
officers
soldiers
and
sailors
was
scarcely
nine
hundred
according
to
a
later
and
more
trustworthy
statement
the
loss
of
the
troops
was
officers
six
hundred
and
sergeants
corporals
drummers
and
private
soldiers
and
women
attached
to
the
regiments
that
is
a
total
of
seven
hundred
and
forty
lives
the
loss
of
the
sailors
is
not
given
but
it
could
scarcely
have
exceeded
two
hundred
the
fleet
spent
the
next
two
days
in
standing
to
and
fro
between
the
northern
and
southern
shores
with
the
exception
of
some
of
the
smaller
vessels
employed
in
bringing
off
the
survivors
from
the
rocks
of
isle
aux
oeufs
the
number
thus
saved
was
according
to
walker
four
hundred
and
on
the
he
went
on
board
the
general
ship
the
windsor
and
hill
and
he
resolved
to
call
a
council
of
war
in
fact
hill
had
already
got
his
colonels
together
signals
were
made
for
the
captains
of
the
to
join
them
and
the
council
began
jack
hill
the
man
about
town
placed
in
high
command
by
the
influence
of
his
sister
the
queen
had
now
an
opportunity
to
justify
his
appointment
and
prove
his
mettle
many
a
man
of
pleasure
and
fashion
when
put
to
the
proof
has
revealed
the
latent
hero
within
him
but
hill
was
not
one
of
them
both
he
and
walker
seemed
to
look
for
nothing
but
a
pretext
for
retreat
and
when
manhood
is
conspicuously
wanting
in
the
leaders
a
council
of
war
is
rarely
disposed
to
supply
it
the
pilots
were
called
in
and
examined
and
they
all
declared
themselves
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
lawrence
which
as
some
of
the
captains
observed
they
had
done
from
the
first
sir
william
phips
with
pilots
still
more
ignorant
had
safely
carried
his
fleet
to
quebec
in
as
walker
must
have
known
for
he
had
with
him
journal
of
the
voyage
the
expedition
had
lost
about
a
twelfth
part
of
its
soldiers
and
sailors
besides
the
transports
that
carried
them
with
this
exception
there
was
no
reason
for
retreat
which
might
not
as
well
have
been
put
forward
when
the
fleet
left
boston
all
the
were
safe
and
the
loss
of
men
was
not
greater
than
might
have
happened
in
a
single
battle
hill
says
that
vetch
when
asked
if
he
would
pilot
the
fleet
to
quebec
refused
to
undertake
it
but
vetch
himself
gives
his
answer
as
follows
i
told
him
the
admiral
i
never
was
bred
to
sea
nor
was
it
any
part
of
my
province
but
i
would
do
my
best
by
going
ahead
and
showing
them
where
the
difficulty
of
the
river
was
which
i
knew
pretty
well
the
naval
captains
however
resolved
that
by
reason
of
the
ignorance
of
the
pilots
and
the
dangerous
currents
it
was
impossible
to
go
up
to
quebec
so
discreditable
a
backing
out
from
a
great
enterprise
will
hardly
be
found
elsewhere
in
english
annals
on
the
next
day
vetch
disappointed
and
indignant
gave
his
mind
freely
to
the
admiral
the
late
disaster
can
not
in
my
humble
opinion
be
anyways
imputed
to
the
difficulty
of
the
navigation
but
to
the
wrong
course
we
steered
which
most
unavoidably
carried
us
upon
the
north
shore
who
directed
that
course
you
best
know
and
as
our
return
without
any
further
attempt
would
be
a
vast
reflection
upon
the
conduct
of
this
affair
so
it
would
be
of
very
fatal
consequence
to
the
interest
of
the
crown
and
all
the
british
colonies
upon
this
continent
his
protest
was
fruitless
the
fleet
retraced
its
course
to
the
gulf
and
then
steered
for
spanish
river
now
the
harbor
of
sydney
in
the
island
of
cape
breton
the
admiral
consoling
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
wreck
was
a
blessing
in
disguise
and
a
merciful
intervention
of
providence
to
save
the
expedition
from
the
freezing
starvation
and
cannibalism
which
his
imagination
had
conjured
up
the
frigate
sapphire
was
sent
to
boston
with
news
of
the
wreck
and
the
retreat
which
was
at
once
despatched
to
nicholson
who
if
he
continued
his
movement
on
montreal
would
now
be
left
to
conquer
canada
alone
his
force
consisted
of
about
hundred
men
white
and
red
and
when
the
fatal
news
reached
him
he
was
encamped
on
wood
creek
ready
to
pass
lake
champlain
captain
butler
a
new
york
officer
at
the
camp
afterwards
told
kalm
the
swedish
naturalist
that
when
nicholson
heard
what
had
happened
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
tore
off
his
wig
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
stamped
upon
it
crying
out
roguery
treachery
when
his
fit
was
over
he
did
all
that
was
now
left
for
him
to
do
burned
the
wooden
forts
he
had
built
marched
back
to
albany
and
disbanded
his
army
after
leaving
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
to
protect
the
frontier
against
canada
had
been
warned
of
the
storm
gathering
against
her
early
in
august
vaudreuil
received
letters
from
costebelle
at
placentia
telling
him
that
english
prisoners
had
reported
mighty
preparations
at
boston
against
quebec
and
that
montreal
was
also
to
be
attacked
the
colony
was
ill
prepared
for
the
emergency
but
no
effort
was
spared
to
give
the
enemy
a
warm
reception
the
militia
were
mustered
indians
called
together
troops
held
in
readiness
and
defences
strengthened
the
saints
were
invoked
and
the
aid
of
heaven
was
implored
by
masses
processions
and
penances
as
in
new
england
by
a
dismal
succession
of
fasts
mother
juchereau
de
tells
us
how
devout
canadians
prayed
for
help
from
god
and
the
most
holy
virgin
since
their
glory
was
involved
seeing
that
the
true
religion
would
quickly
perish
if
the
english
should
prevail
the
general
alarm
produced
effects
which
though
transient
were
thought
highly
commendable
while
they
lasted
the
ladies
according
to
mother
juchereau
gave
up
their
ornaments
and
became
more
modest
and
more
pious
those
of
montreal
pursues
the
worthy
nun
even
outdid
those
of
quebec
for
they
bound
themselves
by
oath
to
wear
neither
ribbons
nor
lace
to
keep
their
throats
covered
and
to
observe
various
holy
practices
for
the
space
of
a
year
the
recluse
of
montreal
mademoiselle
le
ber
who
by
reason
of
her
morbid
seclusion
and
ascetic
life
was
accounted
almost
a
saint
made
a
flag
embroidered
with
a
prayer
to
the
virgin
to
be
borne
against
the
heretical
bands
of
nicholson
when
that
commander
withdrew
his
retreat
though
not
the
cause
of
it
was
quickly
known
at
montreal
and
the
forces
gathered
there
went
down
to
quebec
to
aid
in
repelling
the
more
formidable
attack
by
sea
here
all
was
suspense
and
expectancy
till
the
middle
of
october
when
the
report
came
that
two
large
ships
had
been
seen
in
the
river
below
there
was
great
excitement
for
they
were
supposed
to
be
the
van
of
the
british
fleet
but
alarm
was
soon
turned
to
joy
by
the
arrival
of
the
ships
which
proved
to
be
french
on
the
nineteenth
the
sieur
de
la
valterie
who
had
come
from
labrador
in
september
and
had
been
sent
down
the
river
again
by
vaudreuil
to
watch
for
the
english
fleet
appeared
at
quebec
with
tidings
of
joy
he
had
descended
the
lawrence
in
a
canoe
with
two
frenchmen
and
an
indian
till
landing
at
isle
aux
oeufs
on
the
first
of
october
they
met
two
french
sailors
or
fishermen
loaded
with
plunder
and
presently
discovered
the
wrecks
of
seven
english
ships
with
as
they
declared
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
dead
bodies
on
the
strand
hard
by
besides
dead
horses
sheep
dogs
and
hens
three
or
four
hundred
large
casks
a
barrel
of
wine
and
a
barrel
and
a
keg
of
brandy
cables
anchors
chains
planks
boards
shovels
picks
mattocks
and
piles
of
old
iron
three
feet
high
the
least
devout
writes
mother
juchereau
were
touched
by
the
grandeur
of
the
miracle
wrought
in
our
behalf
a
marvellous
effect
of
god
love
for
canada
which
of
all
these
countries
is
the
only
one
that
professes
the
true
religion
quebec
was
not
ungrateful
a
solemn
mass
was
ordered
every
month
during
a
year
to
be
followed
by
the
song
of
moses
after
the
destruction
of
pharaoh
and
his
host
amazing
reports
were
spread
concerning
the
losses
of
the
english
about
three
thousand
of
these
wretches
so
the
story
ran
died
after
reaching
land
without
counting
the
multitudes
drowned
in
the
attempt
and
even
this
did
not
satisfy
divine
justice
for
god
blew
up
one
of
the
ships
by
lightning
during
the
storm
vessels
were
sent
to
gather
up
the
spoils
of
the
wreck
and
they
came
back
it
was
reported
laden
with
marvellous
treasures
including
rich
clothing
magnificent
saddles
plate
swords
and
the
like
bringing
also
the
gratifying
announcement
that
though
the
autumn
tides
had
swept
away
many
corpses
more
than
two
thousand
still
lay
on
the
rocks
naked
and
in
attitudes
of
despair
these
stories
repeated
by
later
writers
find
believers
to
this
day
when
walker
and
his
ships
reached
spanish
river
he
called
another
council
of
war
the
question
was
whether
having
failed
to
take
quebec
they
should
try
to
take
placentia
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
short
supply
of
provisions
the
impossibility
of
getting
more
from
boston
before
the
first
of
november
and
the
risks
of
the
autumnal
storms
made
the
attempt
impracticable
accordingly
the
new
england
transports
sailed
homeward
and
the
british
fleet
steered

as
to
excite

the
result
was
the

satisfied

gave

and

were

louis

made
important
concessions
the
five
nations
of
the
iroquois
were
acknowledged
to
be
british
subjects
and
this
became
in
future
the
preposterous
foundation
for
vast
territorial
claims
of
england
hudson
bay
newfoundland
and
acadia
according
to
its
ancient
limits
were
also
given
over
by
france
to
her
successful
rival
though
the
king
parted
from
acadia
with
a
reluctance
shown
by
the
great
offers
he
made
for
permission
to
retain
it
but
while
the
treaty
of
utrecht
seemed
to
yield
so
much
and
yielded
so
much
in
fact
it
staved
off
the
settlement
of
questions
absolutely
necessary
for
future
peace
the
limits
of
acadia
the
boundary
line
between
canada
and
the
british
colonies
and
the
boundary
between
those
colonies
and
the
great
western
wilderness
claimed
by
france
were
all
left
unsettled
since
the
attempt
to
settle
them
would
have
rekindled
the
war
the
peace
left
the
embers
of
war
still
smouldering
sure
when
the
time
should
come
to
burst
into
flame
the
next
thirty
years
were
years
of
chronic
smothered
war
disguised
but
never
quite
at
rest
the
standing
subjects
of
dispute
were
three
very
different
in
importance
first
the
question
of
acadia
whether
the
treaty
gave
england
a
vast
country
or
only
a
strip
of
seacoast
next
that
of
northern
new
england
and
the
abenaki
indians
many
of
whom
french
policy
still
left
within
the
borders
of
maine
and
whom
both
powers
claimed
as
subjects
or
allies
last
and
greatest
was
the
question
whether
france
or
england
should
hold
the
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
the
great
lakes
and
with
them
the
virtual
control
of
the
continent
this
was
the
triple
problem
that
tormented
the
northern
english
colonies
for
more
than
a
generation
till
it
found
a
solution
at
last
in
the
seven
years
war
louis
xiv
had
deeply
at
heart
the
recovery
of
acadia
yet
the
old
and
infirm
king
whose
sun
was
setting
in
clouds
after
half
a
century
of
unrivalled
splendor
felt
that
peace
was
a
controlling
necessity
and
he
wrote
as
follows
to
his
plenipotentiaries
at
utrecht
it
is
so
important
to
prevent
the
breaking
off
of
the
negotiations
that
the
king
will
give
up
both
acadia
and
cape
breton
if
necessary
for
peace
but
the
plenipotentiaries
will
yield
this
point
only
in
the
last
extremity
for
by
this
double
cession
canada
will
become
useless
the
access
to
it
will
be
closed
the
fisheries
will
come
to
an
end
and
the
french
marine
be
utterly
destroyed
and
he
adds
that
if
the
english
will
restore
acadia
he
the
king
will
give
them
not
only
christopher
but
also
the
islands
of
martin
and
bartholomew
the
plenipotentiaries
replied
that
the
offer
was
refused
and
that
the
best
they
could
do
without
endangering
the
peace
was
to
bargain
that
cape
breton
should
belong
to
france
on
this
the
king
bid
higher
still
for
the
coveted
province
and
promised
that
if
acadia
were
returned
to
him
the
fortifications
of
placentia
should
be
given
up
untouched
the
cannon
in
the
forts
of
hudson
bay
abandoned
to
the
english
and
the
newfoundland
fisheries
debarred
to
frenchmen
a
remarkable
concession
for
france
had
fished
on
the
banks
of
newfoundland
for
two
centuries
and
they
were
invaluable
to
her
as
a
nursery
of
sailors
even
these
offers
were
rejected
and
england
would
not
resign
acadia
cape
breton
was
left
to
the
french
this
large
island
henceforth
called
by
its
owners
isle
royale
lies
east
of
acadia
and
is
separated
from
it
only
by
the
narrow
strait
of
canseau
from
its
position
it
commands
the
chief
entrance
of
the
gulf
and
river
of
lawrence
some
years
before
the
intendant
raudot
had
sent
to
the
court
an
able
paper
in
which
he
urged
its
occupation
and
settlement
chiefly
on
commercial
and
industrial
grounds
the
war
was
then
at
its
height
the
plan
was
not
carried
into
effect
and
isle
royale
was
still
a
wilderness
it
was
now
proposed
to
occupy
it
for
military
and
political
reasons
one
of
its
many
harbors
well
fortified
and
garrisoned
would
guard
the
approaches
of
canada
and
in
the
next
war
furnish
a
base
for
attacking
new
england
and
recovering
acadia
after
some
hesitation
the
harbor
called
port
à
was
chosen
for
the
proposed
establishment
to
which
the
name
of
louisbourg
was
given
in
honor
of
the
king
it
lies
near
the
southeastern
point
of
the
island
where
an
opening
in
the
ironbound
coast
at
once
easily
accessible
and
easily
defended
gives
entrance
to
a
deep
and
sheltered
basin
where
a
fleet
of
may
find
good
anchorage
the
proposed
fortress
was
to
be
placed
on
the
tongue
of
land
that
lies
between
this
basin
and
the
sea
the
place
well
chosen
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
soldier
or
the
fisherman
was
unfit
for
an
agricultural
colony
its
surroundings
being
barren
hills
studded
with
spruce
and
fir
and
broad
marshes
buried
in
moss
in
spite
of
the
losses
and
humiliations
of
the
war
great
expectations
were
formed
from
the
new
scheme
several
years
earlier
when
the
proposals
of
raudot
were
before
the
marine
council
it
was
confidently
declared
that
a
strong
fortress
on
cape
breton
would
make
the
king
master
of
north
america
the
details
of
the
establishment
were
settled
in
advance
the
king
was
to
build
the
fortifications
supply
them
with
cannon
send
out
eight
companies
of
soldiers
besides
all
the
usual
officers
of
government
establish
a
hospital
conducted
by
nuns
as
at
quebec
provide
jesuits
and
récollets
as
chaplains
besides
filles
de
la
congrégation
to
teach
girls
send
families
to
the
spot
support
them
for
two
years
and
furnish
a
good
number
of
young
women
to
marry
the
soldiers
this
plan
or
something
much
like
it
was
carried
into
effect
louisbourg
was
purely
and
solely
the
offspring
of
the
crown
and
its
ally
the
church
in
time
it
grew
into
a
compact
fishing
town
of
about
four
thousand
inhabitants
with
a
strong
garrison
and
a
circuit
of
formidable
ramparts
and
batteries
it
became
by
far
the
strongest
fortress
on
the
atlantic
coast
and
so
famous
as
a
resort
of
privateers
that
it
was
known
as
the
dunquerque
of
america
what
concerns
us
now
is
its
weak
and
troubled
infancy
it
was
to
be
peopled
in
good
part
from
the
two
lost
provinces
of
acadia
and
newfoundland
whose
inhabitants
were
to
be
transported
to
louisbourg
or
other
parts
of
isle
royale
which
would
thus
be
made
at
once
and
at
the
least
possible
cost
a
dangerous
neighbor
to
the
newly
acquired
possessions
of
england
the
micmacs
of
acadia
and
even
some
of
the
abenakis
were
to
be
included
in
this
scheme
of
immigration
in
the
autumn
the
commandant
of
plaisance
or
placentia
the
french
stronghold
in
newfoundland
received
the
following
mandate
from
the
king
monsieur
de
costebelle
i
have
caused
my
orders
to
be
given
you
to
evacuate
the
town
and
forts
of
plaisance
and
the
other
places
of
your
government
of
newfoundland
ceded
to
my
dear
sister
the
queen
of
great
britain
i
have
given
my
orders
for
the
equipment
of
the
vessels
necessary
to
make
the
evacuation
and
transport
you
with
the
officers
garrison
and
inhabitants
of
plaisance
and
other
places
of
newfoundland
to
my
isle
royale
vulgarly
called
cape
breton
but
as
the
season
is
so
far
advanced
that
this
can
not
be
done
without
exposing
my
troops
and
my
subjects
to
perishing
from
cold
and
misery
and
placing
my
vessels
in
evident
peril
of
wreck
i
have
judged
it
proper
to
defer
the
transportation
till
the
next
spring
the
inhabitants
of
placentia
consisted
only
of
or
thirty
poor
fishermen
with
their
families
and
some
of
them
would
gladly
have
become
english
subjects
and
stayed
where
they
were
but
no
choice
was
given
them
nothing
writes
costebelle
can
cure
them
of
the
error
to
which
they
obstinately
cling
that
they
are
free
to
stay
or
go
as
best
suits
their
interest
they
and
their
were
in
due
time
transported
to
isle
royale
where
for
a
while
their
sufferings
were
extreme
attempts
were
made
to
induce
the
indians
of
acadia
to
move
to
the
new
colony
but
they
refused
and
to
compel
them
was
out
of
the
question
but
by
far
the
most
desirable
accession
to
the
establishment
of
isle
royale
would
be
that
of
the
acadian
french
who
were
too
numerous
to
be
transported
in
the
summary
manner
practised
in
the
case
of
the
fishermen
of
placentia
it
was
necessary
to
persuade
rather
than
compel
them
to
migrate
and
to
this
end
great
reliance
was
placed
on
their
priests
especially
fathers
pain
and
dominique
ponchartrain
himself
wrote
to
the
former
on
the
subject
the
priest
declares
that
he
read
the
letter
to
his
flock
who
answered
that
they
wished
to
stay
in
acadia
and
he
adds
that
the
other
acadians
were
of
the
same
mind
being
unwilling
to
leave
their
rich
farms
and
risk
starvation
on
a
wild
and
barren
island
nevertheless
he
concludes
we
shall
fulfil
the
intentions
of
his
majesty
by
often
holding
before
their
eyes
that
religion
for
which
they
ought
to
make
every
sacrifice
he
and
his
brother
priests
kept
their
word
freedom
of
worship
was
pledged
on
certain
conditions
to
the
acadians
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
and
no
attempt
was
ever
made
to
deprive
them
of
it
yet
the
continual
declaration
of
their
missionaries
that
their
souls
were
in
danger
under
english
rule
was
the
strongest
spur
to
impel
them
to
migrate
the
condition
of
the
english
in
acadia
since
it
fell
into
their
hands
had
been
a
critical
one
port
royal
thenceforth
called
annapolis
royal
or
simply
annapolis
had
been
left
as
before
mentioned
in
charge
of
colonel
vetch
with
a
heterogeneous
garrison
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
the
acadians
of
the
a
term
defined
as
covering
a
space
of
three
miles
round
the
fort
had
been
included
in
the
capitulation
and
had
taken
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
queen
anne
binding
so
long
as
they
remained
in
the
province
some
of
them
worked
for
the
garrison
and
helped
to
repair
the
fort
which
was
in
a
ruinous
condition
meanwhile
the
micmac
indians
remained
fiercely
hostile
to
the
english
and
in
june
aided
by
a
band
of
penobscots
they
ambuscaded
and
killed
or
captured
nearly
seventy
of
them
this
completely
changed
the
attitude
of
the
acadians
they
broke
their
oath
rose
against
their
new
masters
and
with
their
indian
friends
invested
the
fort
to
the
number
of
five
or
six
hundred
disease
desertion
and
the
ambuscade
had
reduced
the
garrison
to
about
two
hundred
effective
men
and
the
defences
of
the
place
were
still
in
bad
condition
the
assailants
on
the
other
hand
had
no
better
leader
than
the
priest
gaulin
missionary
of
the
micmacs
and
prime
mover
in
the
rising
he
presently
sailed
for
placentia
to
beg
for
munitions
and
a
commander
but
his
errand
failed
the
siege
came
to
nought
and
the
besiegers
dispersed
vaudreuil
from
whom
the
acadians
had
begged
help
was
about
to
send
it
when
news
of
the
approach
of
walker
fleet
forced
him
to
keep
all
his
strength
for
his
own
defence
from
this
time
to
the
end
of
the
war
the
chief
difficulties
of
the
governor
of
acadia
rose
not
from
the
enemy
but
from
the
british
authorities
at
home
for
more
than
two
years
he
with
his
starved
and
tattered
garrison
were
treated
with
absolute
neglect
he
received
no
orders
instructions
or
money
acadia
seemed
forgotten
by
the
ministry
till
vetch
heard
at
last
that
nicholson
was
appointed
to
succeed
him
now
followed
the
treaty
of
utrecht
the
cession
of
acadia
to
england
and
the
attempt
on
the
part
of
france
to
induce
the
acadians
to
remove
to
isle
royale
some
of
the
english
officials
had
once
been
of
opinion
that
this
french
catholic
population
should
be
transported
to
martinique
or
some
other
distant
french
colony
and
its
place
supplied
by
protestant
families
sent
from
england
or
ireland
since
the
english
revolution
protestantism
was
bound
up
with
the
new
political
order
and
catholicism
with
the
old
no
catholic
could
favor
the
protestant
succession
and
hence
politics
were
inseparable
from
creed
vetch
who
came
of
a
race
of
hot
and
stubborn
covenanters
had
been
one
of
the
most
earnest
for
replacing
the
catholic
acadians
by
protestants
but
after
the
peace
he
and
others
changed
their
minds
no
protestant
colonists
appeared
nor
was
there
the
smallest
sign
that
the
government
would
give
itself
the
trouble
to
attract
any
it
was
certain
that
if
the
acadians
removed
at
all
they
would
go
not
to
martinique
or
any
other
distant
colony
but
to
the
new
military
establishment
of
isle
royale
which
would
thus
become
a
strong
and
dangerous
neighbor
to
the
feeble
british
post
of
annapolis
moreover
the
labor
of
the
french
inhabitants
was
useful
and
sometimes
necessary
to
the
english
garrison
which
depended
mainly
on
them
for
provisions
and
if
they
left
the
province
they
would
leave
it
a
desert
with
the
prospect
of
long
remaining
so
hence
it
happened
that
the
english
were
for
a
time
almost
as
anxious
to
keep
the
acadians
in
acadia
as
they
were
forty
years
later
to
get
them
out
of
it
nor
had
the
acadians
themselves
any
inclination
to
leave
their
homes
but
the
french
authorities
needed
them
at
isle
royale
and
made
every
effort
to
draw
them
thither
by
the
fourteenth
article
of
the
treaty
of
utrecht
such
of
them
as
might
choose
to
leave
acadia
were
free
to
do
so
within
the
space
of
a
year
carrying
with
them
their
personal
effects
while
a
letter
of
queen
anne
addressed
to
nicholson
then
governor
of
acadia
permitted
the
emigrants
to
sell
their
lands
and
houses
the
missionary
félix
pain
had
reported
as
we
have
seen
that
they
were
in
general
disposed
to
remain
where
they
were
on
which
costebelle
who
now
commanded
at
louisbourg
sent
two
officers
la
ronde
denys
and
pensens
with
instructions
to
set
the
priests
at
work
to
persuade
their
flocks
to
move
la
ronde
denys
and
his
colleague
repaired
to
annapolis
where
they
promised
the
inhabitants
vessels
for
their
removal
provisions
for
a
year
and
freedom
from
all
taxation
for
ten
years
then
having
been
well
prepared
in
advance
the
heads
of
families
were
formed
in
a
circle
and
in
presence
of
the
english
governor
the
two
french
officers
and
the
priests
justinien
bonaventure
and
gaulin
they
all
signed
chiefly
with
crosses
a
paper
to
the
effect
that
they
would
live
and
die
subjects
of
the
king
of
france
a
few
embarked
at
once
for
isle
royale
in
the
vessel
and
the
rest
were
to
follow
within
the
year
this
result
was
due
partly
to
the
promises
of
la
ronde
denys
and
still
more
to
a
pastoral
letter
from
the
bishop
of
quebec
supporting
the
assurances
of
the
missionaries
that
the
heretics
would
rob
them
of
the
ministrations
of
the
church
this
was
not
all
the
acadians
about
annapolis
had
been
alienated
by
the
conduct
of
the
english
authorities
which
was
not
conciliating
and
on
the
part
of
the
governor
was
sometimes
outrageous
yet
those
of
the
had
no
right
to
complain
since
they
had
made
themselves
liable
to
the
penalties
of
treason
by
first
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
queen
anne
and
then
breaking
it
by
trying
to
seize
her
fort
governor
nicholson
like
his
predecessor
was
resolved
to
keep
the
acadians
in
the
province
if
he
could
this
personage
able
energetic
perverse
headstrong
and
unscrupulous
conducted
himself
even
towards
the
english
officers
and
soldiers
in
a
manner
that
seems
unaccountable
and
that
kindled
their
utmost
indignation
towards
the
acadians
his
behavior
was
still
worse
as
costebelle
did
not
keep
his
promise
to
send
vessels
to
bring
them
to
isle
royale
they
built
small
ones
for
themselves
and
the
french
authorities
at
louisbourg
sent
them
the
necessary
rigging
nicholson
ordered
it
back
forbade
the
sale
of
their
lands
and
houses
a
needless
stretch
of
power
as
there
was
nobody
to
buy
and
would
not
let
them
sell
even
their
personal
effects
coolly
setting
at
nought
both
the
treaty
of
utrecht
and
the
letter
of
the
queen
nicholson
was
but
a
short
time
at
annapolis
leaving
the
government
during
most
of
his
term
to
his
deputies
caulfield
and
afterwards
doucette
both
of
whom
roundly
denounce
their
principal
for
his
general
conduct
while
both
in
one
degree
or
another
followed
his
example
in
preventing
so
far
as
they
could
the
emigration
of
the
acadians
some
of
them
however
got
away
and
twelve
or
fifteen
families
who
settled
at
port
toulouse
on
isle
royale
were
near
perishing
from
cold
and
hunger
from
annapolis
the
french
agents
la
ronde
denys
and
pensens
proceeded
to
the
settlements
about
chignecto
and
the
basin
of
mines
the
most
populous
and
prosperous
parts
of
acadia
here
they
were
less
successful
than
before
the
people
were
doubtful
and
vacillating
ready
enough
to
promise
but
slow
to
perform
while
declaring
with
perfect
sincerity
their
devotion
to
our
invincible
monarch
as
they
called
king
louis
who
had
just
been
compelled
to
surrender
their
country
they
clung
tenaciously
to
the
abodes
of
their
fathers
if
they
had
wished
to
emigrate
the
english
governor
had
no
power
to
stop
them
from
baye
verte
on
the
isthmus
they
had
frequent
and
easy
communication
with
the
french
at
louisbourg
which
the
english
did
not
and
could
not
interrupt
they
were
armed
and
they
far
outnumbered
the
english
garrison
while
at
a
word
they
could
bring
to
their
aid
the
micmac
warriors
who
had
been
taught
to
detest
the
english
heretics
as
foes
of
god
and
man
to
say
that
they
wished
to
leave
acadia
but
were
prevented
from
doing
so
by
a
petty
garrison
at
the
other
end
of
the
province
so
feeble
that
it
could
hardly
hold
annapolis
itself
is
an
unjust
reproach
upon
a
people
who
though
ignorant
and
weak
of
purpose
were
not
wanting
in
physical
courage
the
truth
is
that
from
this
time
to
their
forced
expatriation
in
all
the
acadians
except
those
of
annapolis
and
its
immediate
neighborhood
were
free
to
go
or
stay
at
will
those
of
the
eastern
parts
of
the
province
especially
who
formed
the
greater
part
of
the
population
were
completely
their
own
masters
this
was
well
known
to
the
french
authorities
the
governor
of
louisbourg
complains
of
the
apathy
of
the
acadians
declares
that
they
do
not
want
to
fulfil
the
intentions
of
the
king
and
remove
to
isle
royale
costebelle
makes
the
same
complaint
and
again
after
three
years
of
vain
attempts
to
overcome
their
reluctance
he
writes
that
every
effort
has
failed
to
induce
them
to
migrate
from
this
time
forward
the
state
of
affairs
in
acadia
was
a
peculiar
one
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
it
was
a
british
province
and
the
nominal
sovereignty
resided
at
annapolis
in
the
keeping
of
the
miserable
little
fort
and
the
puny
garrison
which
as
late
as
consisted
of
but
five
companies
counting
when
the
ranks
were
full
men
each
more
troops
were
often
asked
for
and
once
or
twice
were
promised
but
they
were
never
sent
this
has
been
hitherto
no
more
than
a
mock
government
its
authority
never
yet
having
extended
beyond
of
the
fort
wrote
governor
philipps
in
it
would
be
more
for
the
honour
of
the
crown
and
profit
also
to
give
back
the
country
to
the
french
than
to
be
contented
with
the
name
only
of
government
philipps
repaired
the
fort
which
as
the
engineer
mascarene
says
had
lain
tumbling
down
before
his
arrival
but
annapolis
and
the
whole
province
remained
totally
neglected
and
almost
forgotten
by
england
till
the
middle
of
the
century
at
one
time
the
soldiers
were
in
so
ragged
a
plight
that
armstrong
was
forced
to
clothe
them
at
his
own
expense
while
this
seat
of
british
sovereignty
remained
in
unchanging
feebleness
for
more
than
forty
years
the
french
acadians
were
multiplying
apace
before
they
were
the
only
white
inhabitants
of
the
province
except
ten
or
twelve
english
families
who
about
the
year
lived
under
the
guns
of
annapolis
at
the
time
of
the
cession
the
french
population
seems
not
to
have
exceeded
two
thousand
souls
about
five
hundred
of
whom
lived
within
the
of
annapolis
and
were
therefore
more
or
less
under
english
control
they
were
all
alike
a
simple
and
ignorant
peasantry
prosperous
in
their
humble
way
and
happy
when
rival
masters
ceased
from
troubling
though
vexed
with
incessant
quarrels
among
themselves
arising
from
the
unsettled
boundaries
of
their
lands
which
had
never
been
properly
surveyed
their
mental
horizon
was
of
the
narrowest
their
wants
were
few
no
military
service
was
asked
of
them
by
the
english
authorities
and
they
paid
no
taxes
to
the
government
they
could
even
indulge
their
strong
appetite
for
litigation
free
of
cost
for
when
as
often
happened
they
brought
their
land
disputes
before
the
council
at
annapolis
the
cases
were
settled
and
the
litigants
paid
no
fees
their
communication
with
the
english
officials
was
carried
on
through
deputies
chosen
by
themselves
and
often
as
ignorant
as
their
constituents
for
a
remarkable
equality
prevailed
through
this
primitive
little
society
except
the
standing
garrison
at
annapolis
acadia
was
as
completely
let
alone
by
the
british
government
as
rhode
island
or
connecticut
unfortunately
the
traditional
british
policy
of
inaction
towards
her
colonies
was
not
applicable
in
the
case
of
a
newly
conquered
province
with
a
disaffected
population
and
active
enterprising
and
martial
neighbors
bent
on
recovering
what
they
had
lost
yet
it
might
be
supposed
that
a
neglect
so
invigorating
in
other
cases
might
have
developed
among
the
acadians
habits
of
and
faculties
of
the
reverse
took
place
for
if
england
neglected
acadia
france
did
not
and
though
she
had
renounced
her
title
to
it
she
still
did
her
best
to
master
it
and
make
it
hers
again
the
chief
instrument
of
her
aggressive
policy
was
the
governor
of
isle
royale
whose
station
was
the
fortress
of
louisbourg
and
who
was
charged
with
the
management
of
acadian
affairs
at
all
the
acadian
settlements
he
had
zealous
and
efficient
agents
in
the
missionary
priests
who
were
sent
into
the
province
by
the
bishop
of
quebec
or
in
a
few
cases
by
their
immediate
ecclesiastical
superiors
in
isle
royale
the
treaty
of
utrecht
secured
freedom
of
worship
to
the
acadians
under
certain
conditions
these
were
that
they
should
accept
the
sovereignty
of
the
british
crown
and
that
they
and
their
pastors
should
keep
within
the
limits
of
british
law
even
supposing
that
by
swearing
allegiance
to
queen
anne
the
acadians
had
acquired
the
freedom
of
worship
which
the
treaty
gave
them
on
condition
of
their
becoming
british
subjects
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
this
freedom
to
use
it
for
subverting
the
power
that
had
granted
it
yet
this
is
what
the
missionaries
did
they
were
not
only
priests
of
the
roman
church
they
were
also
agents
of
the
king
of
france
and
from
first
to
last
they
labored
against
the
british
government
in
the
country
that
france
had
ceded
to
the
british
crown
so
confident
were
they
and
with
so
much
reason
of
the
weakness
of
their
opponents
that
they
openly
avowed
that
their
object
was
to
keep
the
acadians
faithful
to
king
louis
when
two
of
their
number
and
chevereaux
were
summoned
before
the
council
at
annapolis
they
answered
with
great
contempt
we
are
here
on
the
business
of
the
king
of
france
they
were
ordered
to
leave
acadia
one
of
them
stopped
among
the
indians
at
cape
sable
the
other
in
defiance
of
the
council
was
sent
back
to
annapolis
by
the
governor
of
isle
royale
apparently
he
was
again
ordered
away
for
four
years
later
the
french
governor
in
expectation
of
speedy
war
sent
him
to
chignecto
with
orders
secretly
to
prepare
the
acadians
for
an
attack
on
annapolis
the
political
work
of
the
missionaries
began
with
the
cession
of
the
colony
and
continued
with
increasing
activity
till
kindling
the
impotent
wrath
of
the
british
officials
and
drawing
forth
the
bitter
complaints
of
every
successive
governor
for
this
world
and
the
next
the
priests
were
fathers
of
their
flocks
generally
commanding
their
attachment
and
always
their
obedience
except
in
questions
of
disputed
boundaries
where
the
council
alone
could
settle
the
title
the
ecclesiastics
took
the
place
of
judges
and
courts
of
justice
enforcing
their
decisions
by
refusal
of
the
sacraments
they
often
treated
the
british
officials
with
open
scorn
governor
armstrong
writes
to
the
lords
of
trade
without
some
particular
directions
as
to
the
insolent
behavior
of
those
priests
the
people
will
never
be
brought
to
obedience
being
by
them
incited
to
daily
acts
of
rebellion
another
governor
complains
that
they
tell
the
acadians
of
the
destitution
of
the
soldiers
and
the
ruinous
state
of
the
fort
and
assure
them
that
the
pretender
will
soon
be
king
of
england
and
that
acadia
will
then
return
to
france
the
bearer
captain
bennett
writes
armstrong
can
further
tell
your
grace
of
the
disposition
of
the
french
inhabitants
of
this
province
and
of
the
conduct
of
their
missionary
priests
who
instil
hatred
into
both
indians
and
french
against
the
english
as
to
the
indians
governor
philipps
declares
that
their
priests
hear
a
general
confession
from
them
twice
a
year
and
give
them
absolution
on
condition
of
always
being
enemies
of
the
english
the
condition
was
easy
thanks
to
the
neglect
of
the
british
government
which
took
no
pains
to
conciliate
the
micmacs
while
the
french
governor
of
isle
royale
corresponded
secretly
with
them
and
made
them
yearly
presents
in
philipps
advised
the
recall
of
the
french
priests
and
the
sending
of
others
in
their
place
as
the
only
means
of
making
british
subjects
of
the
acadians
who
at
that
time
having
constantly
refused
the
oath
of
allegiance
were
not
entitled
under
the
treaty
to
the
exercise
of
their
religion
governor
armstrong
wrote
sixteen
years
after
by
some
of
the
above
papers
your
grace
will
be
informed
how
high
the
french
government
carries
its
pretensions
over
its
obedience
and
how
to
prevent
the
evil
consequences
i
know
not
unless
we
could
have
missionaries
from
places
independent
of
that
crown
he
expresses
a
doubt
whether
the
home
government
will
be
at
the
trouble
and
expense
of
such
a
change
though
he
adds
that
there
is
not
a
missionary
among
either
acadians
or
indians
who
is
not
in
the
pay
of
france
gaulin
missionary
of
the
micmacs
received
a
gratification
of
fifteen
hundred
livres
besides
an
annual
allowance
of
five
hundred
and
is
described
in
the
order
granting
it
as
a
brave
man
capable
even
of
leading
these
savages
on
an
expedition
in
he
was
brought
before
the
council
at
annapolis
charged
with
incendiary
conduct
among
both
indians
and
acadians
but
on
asking
pardon
and
promising
nevermore
to
busy
himself
with
affairs
of
government
he
was
allowed
to
remain
in
the
province
and
even
to
act
as
curé
of
the
mines
no
evidence
appears
that
the
british
authorities
ever
molested
a
priest
except
when
detected
in
practices
alien
to
his
proper
functions
and
injurious
to
the
government
on
one
occasion
when
two
cures
were
vacant
one
through
sedition
and
the
other
apparently
through
illness
or
death
armstrong
requested
the
governor
of
isle
royale
to
send
two
priests
of
known
probity
to
fill
them
who
were
answerable
for
the
anomalous
state
of
affairs
in
the
province
the
in
where
the
inner
power
waxed
and
strengthened
every
day
and
the
outer
relatively
pined
and
dwindled
it
was
not
mainly
the
crown
of
france
nor
its
agents
secular
or
clerical
their
action
under
the
circumstances
though
sometimes
inexcusable
was
natural
and
might
have
been
foreseen
nor
was
it
the
council
at
annapolis
who
had
little
power
either
for
good
or
evil
it
was
mainly
the
neglect
and
apathy
of
the
british
ministers
who
seemed
careless
as
to
whether
they
kept
acadia
or
lost
it
apparently
thinking
it
not
worth
their
notice
about
the
middle
of
the
century
they
wakened
from
their
lethargy
and
warned
by
the
signs
of
the
times
sent
troops
and
settlers
into
the
province
at
the
eleventh
hour
france
and
her
agents
took
alarm
and
redoubled
their
efforts
to
keep
their
hold
on
a
country
which
they
had
begun
to
regard
as
theirs
already
the
settlement
of
the
english
at
halifax
startled
the
french
into
those
courses
of
intrigue
and
violence
which
were
the
immediate
cause
of
the
removal
of
the
acadians
in
at
the
earlier
period
which
we
are
now
considering
the
storm
was
still
remote
the
english
made
no
attempt
either
to
settle
the
province
or
to
secure
it
by
sufficient
garrisons
they
merely
tried
to
bind
the
inhabitants
by
an
oath
of
allegiance
which
the
weakness
of
the
government
would
constantly
tempt
them
to
break
when
george
came
to
the
throne
caulfield
tried
to
induce
the
inhabitants
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
new
monarch
the
acadians
asked
advice
of
governor
at
louisbourg
who
sent
them
elaborate
directions
how
to
answer
the
english
demand
and
remain
at
the
same
time
faithful
children
of
france
neither
caulfield
nor
his
successor
could
carry
their
point
the
treaty
of
utrecht
as
we
have
seen
gave
the
acadians
a
year
in
which
to
choose
between
remaining
in
the
province
and
becoming
british
subjects
or
leaving
it
as
subjects
of
the
king
of
france
the
year
had
long
ago
expired
and
most
of
them
were
still
in
acadia
unwilling
to
leave
it
yet
refusing
to
own
king
george
in
general
richard
philipps
the
governor
of
the
province
set
himself
to
the
task
of
getting
the
oath
taken
while
the
missionaries
and
the
french
officers
at
isle
royale
strenuously
opposed
his
efforts
he
issued
a
proclamation
ordering
the
acadians
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
king
of
england
or
leave
the
country
without
their
property
within
four
months
in
great
alarm
they
appealed
to
their
priests
and
begged
the
récollet
père
justinien
curé
of
mines
to
ask
advice
and
help
from
successor
of
costebelle
at
louisbourg
protesting
that
they
would
abandon
all
rather
than
renounce
their
religion
and
their
king
at
the
same
time
they
prepared
for
a
general
emigration
by
way
of
the
isthmus
and
baye
verte
where
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
stop
them
without
the
influence
of
their
spiritual
and
temporal
advisers
to
whom
they
turned
in
all
their
troubles
it
is
clear
that
the
acadians
would
have
taken
the
oath
and
remained
in
tranquil
enjoyment
of
their
homes
but
it
was
then
thought
important
to
french
interests
that
they
should
remove
either
to
isle
royale
or
to
isle
jean
now
prince
island
hence
no
means
were
spared
to
prevent
them
from
becoming
british
subjects
if
only
in
name
even
the
micmacs
were
enlisted
in
the
good
work
and
induced
to
threaten
them
with
their
enmity
if
they
should
fail
in
allegiance
to
king
louis
philipps
feared
that
the
acadians
would
rise
in
arms
if
he
insisted
on
the
harsh
requirements
of
his
proclamation
in
which
case
his
position
would
have
been
difficult
as
they
now
outnumbered
his
garrison
about
five
to
one
therefore
he
extended
indefinitely
the
term
of
four
months
that
he
had
fixed
for
their
final
choice
and
continued
to
urge
and
persuade
without
gaining
a
step
towards
the
desired
result
in
vain
he
begged
for
aid
from
the
british
authorities
they
would
do
nothing
for
him
but
merely
observed
that
while
the
french
officers
and
priests
had
such
influence
over
the
acadians
they
would
never
be
good
subjects
and
so
had
better
be
put
out
of
the
country
this
was
easier
said
than
done
for
at
this
very
time
there
were
signs
that
the
acadians
and
the
micmacs
would
unite
to
put
out
the
english
garrison
philipps
was
succeeded
by
a
armstrong
a
person
of
ardent
impulses
and
unstable
disposition
he
applied
himself
with
great
zeal
and
apparent
confidence
to
accomplishing
the
task
in
which
his
principal
had
failed
in
fact
he
succeeded
in
in
persuading
the
inhabitants
about
annapolis
to
take
the
oath
with
a
proviso
that
they
should
not
be
called
upon
for
military
service
but
the
main
body
of
the
acadians
stiffly
refused
in
the
next
year
he
sent
ensign
wroth
to
mines
chignecto
and
neighboring
settlements
to
renew
the
attempt
on
occasion
of
the
accession
of
george
ii
the
instructions
left
much
to
his
discretion
or
his
indiscretion
and
he
came
back
with
the
signatures
or
crosses
of
the
inhabitants
attached
to
an
oath
so
clogged
with
conditions
that
it
left
them
free
to
return
to
their
french
allegiance
whenever
they
chose
philipps
now
came
back
to
acadia
to
resume
his
difficult
task
and
here
a
surprise
meets
us
he
reported
a
complete
success
the
acadians
as
he
declared
swore
allegiance
without
reserve
to
king
george
but
he
does
not
tell
us
how
they
were
brought
to
do
so
compulsion
was
out
of
the
question
they
could
have
cut
to
pieces
any
part
of
the
paltry
english
garrison
that
might
venture
outside
the
ditches
of
annapolis
or
they
might
have
left
acadia
with
all
their
goods
and
chattels
with
no
possibility
of
stopping
them
the
taking
of
the
oath
was
therefore
a
voluntary
act
but
what
was
the
oath
the
words
reported
by
philipps
were
as
follows
i
promise
and
swear
sincerely
on
the
faith
of
a
christian
that
i
will
be
entirely
faithful
and
will
truly
obey
his
majesty
king
george
the
second
whom
i
recognize
as
sovereign
lord
of
acadia
or
nova
scotia
so
help
me
god
to
this
the
acadians
affixed
their
crosses
or
in
exceptional
cases
their
names
recently
however
evidence
has
appeared
that
so
far
at
least
as
regards
the
acadians
on
and
near
mines
basin
the
effect
of
the
oath
was
qualified
by
a
promise
on
the
part
of
philipps
that
they
should
not
be
required
to
take
up
arms
against
either
french
or
indians
they
on
their
part
promising
never
to
take
up
arms
against
the
english
this
statement
is
made
by
gaudalie
curé
of
the
parish
of
mines
and
noiville
priest
at
pigiquid
or
pisiquid
now
windsor
in
fact
the
english
never
had
the
folly
to
call
on
the
acadians
to
fight
for
them
and
the
greater
part
of
this
people
were
true
to
their
promise
not
to
take
arms
against
the
english
though
a
considerable
number
of
them
did
so
especially
at
the
beginning
of
the
seven
years
war
it
was
to
this
promise
whether
kept
or
broken
that
they
owed
their
name
of
neutral
french
from
first
to
last
the
acadians
remained
in
a
dependence
on
their
spiritual
and
temporal
guides
not
one
of
their
number
stands
out
prominently
from
among
the
rest
they
seem
to
have
been
totally
devoid
of
natural
leaders
and
unhappily
for
themselves
left
their
fate
in
the
hands
of
others
yet
they
were
fully
aware
of
their
numerical
strength
and
had
repeatedly
declared
in
a
manner
that
the
english
officers
called
insolent
that
they
would
neither
leave
the
country
nor
swear
allegiance
to
king
george
the
truth
probably
is
that
those
who
governed
them
had
become
convinced
that
this
simple
population
which
increased
rapidly
and
could
always
be
kept
french
at
heart
might
be
made
more
useful
to
france
in
acadia
than
out
of
it
and
that
it
was
needless
further
to
oppose
the
taking
of
an
oath
which
would
leave
them
in
quiet
possession
of
their
farms
without
making
any
change
in
their
feelings
and
probably
none
in
their
actions
by
force
of
natural
increase
acadia
would
in
time
become
the
seat
of
a
large
population
ardently
french
and
ardently
catholic
and
while
officials
in
france
sometimes
complained
of
the
reluctance
of
the
acadians
to
move
to
isle
royale
those
who
directed
them
in
their
own
country
seem
to
have
become
willing
that
they
should
stay
where
they
were
and
place
themselves
in
such
relations
with
the
english
as
should
leave
them
free
to
increase
and
multiply
undisturbed
deceived
by
the
long
apathy
of
the
british
government
french
officials
did
not
foresee
that
a
time
would
come
when
it
would
bestir
itself
to
make

as
well
as

forty
years

of
the
rival
nations
were
in

so
discordant
that
any
attempt
to
reconcile
them
must
needs
produce
a
fresh
quarrel
the

had
left
a
choice
of
evils
to
discuss
the
boundary
question
meant
to
renew
the
war
to
leave
it
unsettled
was
a
source
of
constant
irritation
and
while
delay
staved
off
a
great
war
it
quickly
produced
a
small
one
the
river
kennebec
which
was
generally
admitted
by
the
french
to
be
the
dividing
line
between
their
possessions
and
new
england
was
regarded
by
them
with
the
most
watchful
jealousy
its
headwaters
approached
those
of
the
canadian
river
chaudière
the
mouth
of
which
is
near
quebec
and
by
ascending
the
former
stream
and
crossing
to
the
headwaters
of
the
latter
through
an
intricacy
of
forests
hills
ponds
and
marshes
it
was
possible
for
a
small
band
of
hardy
men
unencumbered
by
cannon
to
reach
the
canadian
capital
as
was
done
long
after
by
the
followers
of
benedict
arnold
hence
it
was
thought
a
matter
of
the
last
importance
to
close
the
kennebec
against
such
an
attempt
the
norridgewock
band
of
the
abenakis
who
lived
on
the
banks
of
that
river
were
used
to
serve
this
purpose
and
to
form
a
sort
of
to
the
french
colony
while
other
kindred
bands
on
the
penobscot
the
croix
and
the
john
were
expected
to
aid
in
opposing
a
living
barrier
to
english
intrusion
missionaries
were
stationed
among
all
these
indians
to
keep
them
true

most
important
station
that
of
the

of

the

in

far
more
than
a

it
was
an

of

and
religious
life
the
offspring
of
causes
long
in
action
and
the
parent
of
other
movements
in
action
to
this
day
the
protestant
reformation
was
a
part
of
it
that
revolt
against
rome
produced
a
counter
renaissance
in
the
bosom
of
the
ancient
church
herself
in
presence
of
that
peril
she
woke
from
sloth
and
corruption
and
girded
herself
to
beat
back
the
invading
heresies
by
force
or
by
craft
by
inquisitorial
fires
by
the
arms
of
princely
and
imperial
allies
and
by
the
enthusiasm
of
her
saints
and
martyrs
that
time
of
danger
produced
the
exalted
zeal
of
xavier
and
the
intense
thoughtful
organizing
zeal
of
loyola
after
a
century
had
passed
the
flame
still
burned
and
it
never
shone
with
a
purer
or
brighter
radiance
than
in
the
early
missions
of
new
france
such
ardors
can
not
be
permanent
they
must
subside
from
the
law
of
their
nature
if
the
great
western
mission
had
been
a
success
the
enthusiasm
of
its
founders
might
have
maintained
itself
for
some
time
longer
but
that
mission
was
extinguished
in
blood
its
martyrs
died
in
vain
and
the
burning
faith
that
had
created
it
was
rudely
tried
canada
ceased
to
be
a
mission
the
civil
and
military
powers
grew
strong
and
the
church
no
longer
ruled
with
undivided
sway
the
times
changed
and
the
men
changed
with
them
it
is
a
characteristic
of
the
jesuit
order
and
one
of
the
sources
of
its
strength
that
it
chooses
the
workman
for
his
work
studies
the
qualities
of
its
members
and
gives
to
each
the
task
for
which
he
is
fitted
best
when
its
aim
was
to
convert
savage
hordes
and
build
up
another
paraguay
in
the
northern
wilderness
it
sent
a
jogues
a
brébeuf
a
charles
garnier
and
a
gabriel
lalemant
like
a
forlorn
hope
to
storm
the
stronghold
of
heathendom
in
later
times
it
sent
other
men
to
meet
other
needs
and
accomplish
other
purposes
before
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
functions
of
the
canadian
jesuit
had
become
as
much
political
as
religious
but
if
the
fires
of
his
apostolic
zeal
burned
less
high
his
devotion
to
the
order
in
which
he
had
merged
his
personality
was
as
intense
as
before
while
in
constant
friction
with
the
civil
and
military
powers
he
tried
to
make
himself
necessary
to
them
and
in
good
measure
he
succeeded
nobody
was
so
able
to
manage
the
indian
tribes
and
keep
them
in
the
interest
of
france
religion
says
charlevoix
is
the
chief
bond
by
which
the
savages
are
attached
to
us
and
it
was
the
jesuit
above
all
others
who
was
charged
to
keep
this
bond
firm
the
christianity
that
was
made
to
serve
this
useful
end
did
not
strike
a
deep
root
while
humanity
is
in
the
savage
state
it
can
only
be
christianized
on
the
surface
and
the
convert
of
the
jesuits
remained
a
savage
still
they
did
not
even
try
to
civilize
him
they
taught
him
to
repeat
a
catechism
which
he
could
not
understand
and
practise
rites
of
which
the
spiritual
significance
was
incomprehensible
to
him
he
saw
the
symbols
of
his
new
faith
in
much
the
same
light
as
the
superstitions
that
had
once
enchained
him
to
his
eyes
the
crucifix
was
a
fetich
of
surpassing
power
and
the
mass
a
beneficent
medicine
or
occult
influence
of
supreme
efficacy
yet
he
would
not
forget
his
old
rooted
beliefs
and
it
needed
the
constant
presence
of
the
missionary
to
prevent
him
from
returning
to
them
since
the
iroquois
had
ceased
to
be
a
danger
to
canada
the
active
alliance
of
the
western
indians
had
become
less
important
to
the
colony
hence
the
missions
among
them
had
received
less
attention
and
most
of
these
tribes
had
relapsed
into
heathenism
the
chief
danger
had
shifted
eastward
and
was
or
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
direction
of
new
england
therefore
the
eastern
missions
were
cultivated
with
diligence
whether
those
within
or
adjoining
the
settled
limits
of
canada
like
the
iroquois
mission
of
caughnawaga
the
abenaki
missions
of
francis
and
becancour
and
the
huron
mission
of
lorette
or
those
that
served
as
outposts
and
of
the
colony
like
the
norridgewock
abenakis
of
the
kennebec
or
the
penobscot
abenakis
of
the
penobscot
the
priests
at
all
these
stations
were
in
close
correspondence
with
the
government
to
which
their
influence
over
their
converts
was
invaluable
in
the
wilderness
dens
of
the
hurons
or
the
iroquois
the
early
jesuit
was
a
marvel
of
zeal
his
successor
half
missionary
and
half
agent
of
the
king
had
thought
for
this
world
as
well
as
the
next
sebastien
rale
born
in
in
was
sent
to
the
american
missions
in
at
the
age
of
after
spending
two
years
among
the
abenakis
of
canada
then
settled
near
the
mouth
of
the
chaudière
he
was
sent
for
two
years
more
to
the
illinois
and
thence
to
the
abenakis
of
the
kennebec
where
he
was
to
end
his
days
near
where
the
town
of
norridgewock
now
stands
the
kennebec
curved
round
a
broad
tongue
of
meadow
land
in
the
midst
of
a
picturesque
wilderness
of
hills
and
forests
on
this
tongue
of
land
on
ground
a
few
feet
above
the
general
level
stood
the
village
of
the
norridgewocks
fenced
with
a
stockade
of
round
logs
nine
feet
high
the
enclosure
was
square
each
of
its
four
sides
measured
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
and
each
had
its
gate
from
the
four
gates
ran
two
streets
or
lanes
which
crossed
each
other
in
the
middle
of
the
village
there
were
indian
houses
or
cabins
within
the
stockade
described
as
built
much
after
the
english
manner
though
probably
of
logs
the
church
was
outside
the
enclosure
about
twenty
paces
from
the
east
gate
such
was
the
mission
village
of
norridgewock
in
it
had
risen
from
its
ashes
since
colonel
hilton
destroyed
it
in
and
the
church
had
been
rebuilt
by
new
england
workmen
hired
for
the
purpose
a
small
bell
which
is
still
preserved
at
brunswick
rang
for
mass
at
early
morning
and
for
vespers
at
sunset
rale
leisure
hours
were
few
he
preached
exhorted
catechised
the
young
converts
counselled
their
seniors
for
this
world
and
the
next
nursed
them
in
sickness
composed
their
quarrels
tilled
his
own
garden
cut
his
own
firewood
cooked
his
own
food
which
was
of
indian
corn
or
at
a
pinch
of
roots
and
acorns
worked
at
his
abenaki
vocabulary
and
being
expert
at
handicraft
made
ornaments
for
the
church
or
moulded
candles
from
the
fruit
of
the
bayberry
or
twice
a
year
summer
and
winter
he
followed
his
flock
to
the
and
the
islands
where
they
lived
at
their
ease
on
fish
and
seals
clams
oysters
and
seafowl
this
kennebec
mission
had
been
begun
more
than
half
a
century
before
yet
the
conjurers
or
medicine
men
natural
enemies
of
the
missionary
still
remained
obdurate
and
looked
on
the
father
askance
though
the
body
of
the
tribe
were
constant
at
mass
and
confession
and
regarded
him
with
loving
reverence
he
always
attended
their
councils
and
as
he
tells
us
his
advice
always
prevailed
but
he
was
less
fortunate
when
he
told
them
to
practise
no
needless
cruelty
in
their
wars
on
which
point
they
were
often
disobedient
children
rale
was
of
a
strong
enduring
frame
and
a
keen
vehement
caustic
spirit
he
had
the
gift
of
tongues
and
was
as
familiar
with
the
abenaki
and
several
other
indian
languages
as
he
was
with
latin
of
the
genuineness
of
his
zeal
there
is
no
doubt
nor
of
his
earnest
and
lively
interest
in
the
fortunes
of
the
wilderness
flock
of
which
he
was
the
shepherd
for
half
his
life
the
situation
was
critical
for
them
and
for
him
the
english
settlements
were
but
a
short
distance
below
while
those
of
the
french
could
be
reached
only
by
a
hard
journey
of
twelve
or
fourteen
days
with
two
intervals
of
uneasy
peace
the
borders
of
maine
had
been
harried
by
for
years
and
since
these
raids
had
been
prompted
and
aided
by
the
french
thus
it
happened
that
extensive
tracts
which
before
philip
war
were
dotted
with
farmhouses
and
fishing
hamlets
had
been
abandoned
and
cultivated
fields
were
turning
again
to
forests
the
village
of
wells
had
become
the
eastern
frontier
but
now
the
treaty
of
utrecht
gave
promise
of
lasting
tranquillity
the
abenakis
hearing
that
they
were
to
be
backed
no
longer
by
the
french
became
alarmed
sent
messengers
to
casco
and
asked
for
peace
in
july
there
was
a
convention
at
portsmouth
when
delegates
of
the
norridgewocks
penobscots
malicites
and
other
abenaki
bands
met
governor
dudley
and
the
councillors
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
a
paper
was
read
to
them
by
sworn
interpreters
in
which
they
confessed
that
they
had
broken
former
treaties
begged
pardon
for
past
rebellions
hostilities
and
violations
of
promises
declared
themselves
subjects
of
queen
anne
pledged
firm
friendship
with
the
english
and
promised
them
that
they
might
without
molestation
on
all
their
former
possessions
eight
of
the
principal
abenaki
chiefs
signed
this
document
with
their
totemic
marks
and
the
rest
did
so
after
similar
interpretation
at
another
convention
in
the
next
year
indians
when
in
trouble
can
waive
their
pride
and
lavish
professions
and
promises
but
when
they
called
themselves
subjects
of
queen
anne
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
did
not
know
what
the
words
meant
peace
with
the
indians
was
no
sooner
concluded
than
a
stream
of
settlers
began
to
move
eastward
to
reoccupy
the
lands
that
they
owned
or
claimed
in
the
region
of
the
lower
kennebec
much
of
this
country
was
held
in
extensive
tracts
under
old
grants
of
the
last
century
and
the
proprietors
offered
great
inducements
to
attract
emigrants
the
government
of
massachusetts
though
impoverished
by
three
wars
of
which
it
had
borne
the
chief
burden
added
what
encouragements
it
could
the
hamlets
of
saco
scarborough
falmouth
and
georgetown
rose
from
their
ashes
mills
were
built
on
the
streams
old
farms
were
retilled
and
new
ones
cleared
a
certain
noyes
who
had
established
a
sturgeon
fishery
on
the
kennebec
built
at
his
own
charge
a
stone
fort
at
cushnoc
or
augusta
and
it
is
said
that
as
early
as
a
blockhouse
was
built
many
miles
above
near
the
mouth
of
the
sebasticook
in
the
next
year
fort
george
was
built
at
the
lower
falls
of
the
androscoggin
and
some
years
later
fort
richmond
on
the
kennebec
at
the
site
of
the
present
town
of
richmond
some
of
the
claims
to
these
kennebec
lands
were
based
on
old
crown
patents
some
on
mere
prescription
some
on
indian
titles
good
or
bad
rale
says
that
an
englishman
would
give
an
indian
a
bottle
of
rum
and
get
from
him
in
return
a
large
tract
of
land
something
like
this
may
have
happened
though
in
other
cases
the
titles
were
as
good
as
indian
titles
usually
are
the
deeds
being
in
regular
form
and
signed
by
the
principal
chiefs
for
a
consideration
which
they
thought
sufficient
the
lands
of
indians
however
are
owned
so
far
as
owned
at
all
by
the
whole
community
and
in
the
case
of
the
algonquin
tribes
the
chiefs
had
no
real
authority
to
alienate
them
without
the
consent
of
the
tribesmen
even
supposing
this
consent
to
have
been
given
the
norridgewocks
would
not
have
been
satisfied
for
rale
taught
them
that
they
could
not
part
with
their
lands
because
they
held
them
in
trust
for
their
children
to
whom
their
country
belonged
as
much
as
to
themselves
long
years
of
war
and
mutual
wrong
had
embittered
the
norridgewocks
against
their
english
neighbors
with
whom
nevertheless
they
wished
to
be
at
peace
because
they
feared
them
and
because
their
trade
was
necessary
to
them
the
english
borderers
on
their
part
regarded
the
indians
less
as
men
than
as
vicious
and
dangerous
wild
animals
in
fact
the
benevolent
and
philanthropic
view
of
the
american
savage
is
for
those
who
are
beyond
his
reach
it
has
never
yet
been
held
by
any
whose
wives
and
children
have
lived
in
danger
of
his
in
boston
and
other
of
the
older
and
safer
settlements
the
indians
had
found
devoted
friends
before
philip
war
and
even
now
they
had
apologists
and
defenders
prominent
among
whom
was
that
relic
of
antique
puritanism
old
samuel
sewall
who
was
as
conscientious
and
humane
as
he
was
prosy
narrow
and
sometimes
absurd
and
whose
benevolence
towards
the
former
owners
of
the
soil
was
trebly
reinforced
by
his
notion
that
they
were
descendants
of
the
ten
lost
tribes
of
israel
the
intrusion
of
settlers
and
the
building
of
forts
and
blockhouses
on
lands
which
they
still
called
their
own
irritated
and
alarmed
the
norridgewocks
and
their
growing
resentment
was
fomented
by
rale
both
because
he
shared
it
himself
and
because
he
was
prompted
by
vaudreuil
yet
dreading
another
war
with
the
english
the
indians
kept
quiet
for
a
year
or
two
till
at
length
the
more
reckless
among
them
began
to
threaten
and
pilfer
the
settlers
in
colonel
samuel
shute
came
out
to
succeed
dudley
as
governor
and
in
the
next
summer
he
called
the
indians
to
a
council
at
georgetown
a
settlement
on
arrowsick
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
kennebec
thither
he
went
in
the
frigate
squirrel
with
the
councillors
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
while
the
deputies
of
the
norridgewocks
penobscots
pequawkets
or
abenakis
of
the
saco
and
assagunticooks
or
abenakis
of
the
androscoggin
came
in
canoes
to
meet
him
and
set
up
their
wigwams
on
a
neighboring
island
the
council
opened
on
the
ninth
of
august
under
a
large
tent
over
which
waved
the
british
flag
the
oath
was
administered
to
the
interpreters
by
the
aged
judge
sewall
and
shute
then
made
the
indians
a
speech
in
which
he
told
them
that
the
english
and
they
were
subjects
of
the
great
good
and
wise
king
george
that
as
both
peoples
were
under
the
same
king
he
would
gladly
see
them
also
of
the
same
religion
since
it
was
the
only
true
one
and
to
this
end
he
gave
them
a
bible
and
a
minister
to
teach
them
pointing
to
rev
joseph
baxter
who
stood
near
by
and
he
further
assured
them
that
if
any
wrong
should
be
done
them
he
would
set
it
right
he
then
condescended
to
give
his
hand
to
the
chiefs
telling
them
through
the
interpreter
that
it
was
to
show
his
affection
the
indians
after
their
usual
custom
deferred
their
answer
to
the
next
day
when
the
council
again
met
and
the
norridgewock
chief
wiwurna
addressed
the
governor
as
spokesman
for
his
people
in
defiance
of
every
indian
idea
of
propriety
shute
soon
began
to
interrupt
him
with
questions
and
remarks
wiwurna
remonstrated
civilly
but
shute
continued
his
interruptions
and
the
speech
turned
to
a
dialogue
which
may
be
abridged
thus
shute
always
addressing
himself
not
to
the
indian
orator
but
to
the
interpreter
the
orator
expressed
satisfaction
at
the
arrival
of
the
governor
and
hoped
that
peace
and
friendship
would
now
prevail
governor
the
tell
them
that
if
they
behave
themselves
i
shall
use
them

by
the
your

to

that

on
our
land
governor
they
must
not
call
it
their
land
for
the
english
have
bought
it
of
them
and
their
ancestors
orator
we
pray
leave
to
proceed
with
our
answer
and
talk
about
the
land
afterwards
wiwurna
then
with
much
civility
begged
to
be
excused
from
receiving
the
bible
and
the
minister
and
ended
by
wishing
the
governor
good
wind
and
weather
for
his
homeward
voyage
there
was
another
meeting
in
the
afternoon
in
which
the
orator
declared
that
his
people
were
willing
that
the
english
should
settle
on
the
west
side
of
the
kennebec
as
far
up
the
river
as
a
certain
mill
on
which
the
governor
said
to
the
interpreter
tell
them
we
want
nothing
but
our
own
and
that
that
we
will
have
and
he
ordered
an
old
deed
of
sale
signed
by
six
of
their
chiefs
to
be
shown
and
explained
to
them
wiwurna
returned
that
though
his
tribe
were
uneasy
about
their
lands
they
were
willing
that
the
english
should
keep
what
they
had
got
excepting
the
forts
on
this
point
there
was
a
sharp
dialogue
and
shute
said
bluntly
that
if
he
saw
fit
he
should
build
a
fort
at
every
new
settlement
at
this
all
the
indians
rose
abruptly
and
went
back
to
their
camp
leaving
behind
an
english
flag
that
had
been
given
them
rale
was
at
the
indian
camp
and
some
of
them
came
back
in
the
evening
with
a
letter
from
him
in
which
he
told
shute
that
the
governor
of
canada
had
asked
the
king
of
france
whether
he
had
ever
given
the
indians
land
to
the
english
to
which
the
king
replied
that
he
had
not
and
would
help
the
indians
to
repel
any
encroachment
upon
them
this
cool
assumption
on
the
part
of
france
of
paramount
right
to
the
abenaki
country
incensed
shute
who
rejected
the
letter
with
contempt
as
between
the
governor
and
the
indian
orator
the
savage
had
shown
himself
by
far
the
more
mannerly
yet
so
unwilling
were
the
indians
to
break
with
the
english
that
on
the
next
morning
seeing
shute
about
to
they
sent
messengers
to
him
to
apologize
for
what
they
called
their
rudeness
beg
that
the
english
flag
might
be
returned
to
them
and
ask
for
another
interview
saying
that
they
would
appoint
another
spokesman
instead
of
wiwurna
who
had
given
so
much
offence
shute
consented
and
the
meeting
was
held
the
new
orator
presented
a
wampum
belt
expressed
a
wish
for
peace
and
said
that
his
people
wished
the
english
to
extend
their
settlements
as
far
as
they
had
formerly
done
shute
on
his
part
promised
that
should
be
established
for
supplying
their
needs
and
that
they
should
have
a
smith
to
mend
their
guns
and
an
interpreter
of
their
own
choice
twenty
chiefs
and
elders
then
affixed
their
totemic
marks
to
a
paper
renewing
the
pledges
made
four
years
before
at
portsmouth
and
the
meeting
closed
with
a
dance
in
honor
of
the
governor
the
indians
as
we
have
seen
had
shown
no
eagerness
to
accept
the
ministrations
of
rev
joseph
baxter
the
massachusetts
assembly
had
absurdly
tried
to
counteract
the
influence
of
rale
by
offering
a
year
in
their
depreciated
currency
to
any
one
of
their
ministers
who
would
teach
calvinism
to
the
indians
baxter
whom
rale
with
characteristic
exaggeration
calls
the
ablest
of
the
boston
ministers
but
who
was
far
from
being
so
as
he
was
the
pastor
of
the
small
country
village
of
medfield
took
up
the
task
and
with
no
experience
of
indian
life
or
knowledge
of
any
indian
language
entered
the
lists
against
an
adversary
who
had
spent
half
his
days
among
savages
had
gained
the
love
and
admiration
of
the
norridgewocks
and
spoke
their
language
fluently
baxter
with
the
confidence
of
a
novice
got
an
interpreter
and
began
to
preach
exhort
and
launch
sarcasms
against
the
doctrines
and
practices
of
the
roman
church
rale
excommunicated
such
of
his
flock
as
listened
to
him
yet
some
persisted
in
doing
so
and
three
of
these
petitioned
the
english
governor
to
order
a
small
to
be
built
for
their
use
rale
greatly
exasperated
opened
a
correspondence
with
baxter
and
wrote
a
treatise
for
his
benefit
in
which
through
a
hundred
pages
of
polemical
latin
he
proved
that
the
church
of
rome
was
founded
on
a
rock
this
he
sent
to
baxter
and
challenged
him
to
overthrow
his
reasons
baxter
sent
an
answer
for
which
rale
expresses
great
scorn
as
to
both
manner
and
matter
he
made
a
rejoinder
directed
not
only
against
his
opponent
arguments
but
against
his
latin
in
which
he
picked
flaws
with
great
apparent
satisfaction
he
says
that
he
heard
no
more
from
baxter
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
got
another
letter
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
the
purpose
the
minister
merely
charging
him
with
an
irascible
and
censorious
spirit
this
letter
is
still
preserved
and
it
does
not
answer
to
rale
account
of
it
baxter
replies
to
his
correspondent
vigorously
defends
his
own
latin
attacks
that
of
rale
and
charges
him
with
losing
temper
rale
correspondence
with
the
new
england
ministers
seems
not
to
have
been
confined
to
baxter
a
paper
is
preserved
translated
apparently
from
a
latin
original
and
entitled
remarks
out
of
the
fryar
sebastian
rale
letter
from
norridgewock
february
this
letter
appears
to
have
been
addressed
to
some
boston
minister
and
is
of
a
scornful
and
defiant
character
using
language
ill
fitted
to
conciliate
as
thus
you
must
know
that
a
missionary
is
not
a
cipher
like
a
minister
or
thus
a
jesuit
is
not
a
baxter
or
a
boston
minister
the
tone
is
one
of
exasperation
dashed
with
contempt
and
the
chief
theme
is
english
encroachment
and
the
inalienability
of
indian
lands
rale
says
that
baxter
gave
up
his
mission
after
receiving
the
treatise
on
the
infallible
supremacy
of
the
true
church
but
this
is
a
mistake
as
the
minister
made
three
successive
visits
to
the
eastern
country
before
he
tired
of
his
hopeless
mission
in
the
letter
just
quoted
rale
seems
to
have
done
his
best
to
rasp
the
temper
of
his
new
england
correspondent
he
boasts
of
his
power
over
the
indians
who
as
he
declares
always
do
as
he
advises
them
any
treaty
with
the
governor
he
goes
on
to
say
and
especially
that
of
arrowsick
is
null
and
void
if
i
do
not
approve
it
for
i
give
them
so
many
reasons
against
it
that
they
absolutely
condemn
what
they
have
done
he
says
further
that
if
they
do
not
drive
the
english
from
the
kennebec
he
will
leave
them
and
that
they
will
then
lose
both
their
lands
and
their
souls
and
he
adds
that
if
necessary
he
will
tell
them
that
they
may
make
war
rale
wrote
also
to
shute
and
though
the
letter
is
lost
the
governor
answer
shows
that
it
was
sufficiently
aggressive
the
wild
indian
is
unstable
as
water
at
arrowsick
the
norridgewocks
were
all
for
peace
but
when
they
returned
to
their
village
their
mood
changed
and
on
the
representations
of
rale
they
began
to
kill
the
cattle
of
the
english
settlers
on
the
river
below
burn
their
haystacks
and
otherwise
annoy
them
the
english
suspected
that
the
jesuit
was
the
source
of
their
trouble
and
as
they
had
always
regarded
the
lands
in
question
as
theirs
by
virtue
of
the
charter
of
the
plymouth
company
in
and
the
various
grants
under
it
as
well
as
by
purchase
from
the
indians
their
ire
against
him
burned
high
yet
afraid
as
the
indians
were
of
another
war
even
rale
could
scarcely
have
stirred
them
to
violence
but
for
the
indignities
put
upon
them
by
ruffians
of
the
border
vicious
traders
and
hungry
they
had
still
another
cause
of
complaint
shute
had
promised
to
build
where
their
wants
should
be
supplied
without
fraud
and
extortion
but
he
had
not
kept
his
word
and
could
not
keep
it
for
reasons
that
will
soon
appear
in
spite
of
such
provocations
norridgewock
was
divided
in
opinion
not
only
were
the
indians
in
great
dread
of
war
but
they
had
received
english
presents
to
a
considerable
amount
chiefly
from
private
persons
interested
in
keeping
them
quiet
hence
to
rale
great
chagrin
there
was
an
english
party
in
the
village
so
strong
that
when
the
english
authorities
demanded
reparation
for
the
mischief
done
to
the
settlers
the
norridgewocks
promised
two
hundred
as
damages
and
gave
four
hostages
as
security
that
they
would
pay
for
misdeeds
in
the
past
and
commit
no
more
in
the
future
rale
now
feared
that
his
indians
would
all
go
over
to
the
english
and
tamely
do
their
bidding
for
though
most
of
them
when
he
was
present
would
denounce
the
heretics
and
boast
of
the
brave
deeds
they
would
do
against
them
yet
after
a
meeting
with
english
officials
they
would
change
their
minds
and
accuse
their
spiritual
father
of
lying
it
was
clear
that
something
must
be
done
to
end
these
waverings
lest
the
lands
in
dispute
should
be
lost
to
france
forever
the
norridgewocks
had
been
invited
to
another
interview
with
the
english
at
georgetown
and
rale
resolved
in
modern
american
phrase
to
capture
the
meeting
vaudreuil
and
the
jesuit
la
chasse
superior
of
the
mission
lent
their
aid
messengers
were
sent
to
the
converted
indians
of
canada
whose
attachment
to
france
and
the
church
was
past
all
doubt
and
who
had
been
taught
to
abhor
the
english
as
children
of
the
devil
the
object
of
the
message
was
to
induce
them
to
go
to
the
meeting
at
georgetown
armed
and
equipped
for
any
contingency
they
went
accordingly
abenakis
from
becancour
and
francis
hurons
from
lorette
and
iroquois
from
caughnawaga
besides
others
all
stanch
foes
of
heresy
and
england
rale
and
la
chasse
directed
their
movements
and
led
them
first
to
norridgewock
where
their
arrival
made
a
revolution
the
peace
party
changed
color
like
a
chameleon
and
was
all
for
war
the
united
bands
two
hundred
and
fifty
warriors
in
all
paddled
down
the
kennebec
along
with
the
two
jesuits
and
two
french
officers
and
croisil
in
a
few
days
the
english
at
georgetown
saw
them
parading
before
the
fort
well
armed
displaying
french
flags
feathers
dangling
from
their
and
faces
fantastically
patterned
in
vermilion
ochre
white
clay
soot
and
such
other
pigments
as
they
could
find
or
buy
they
were
met
by
captain
penhallow
and
other
militia
officers
of
the
fort
to
whom
they
gave
the
promised
two
hundred
and
demanded
the
four
hostages
in
return
but
the
hostages
had
been
given
as
security
not
only
for
the
but
also
for
the
future
good
behavior
of
the
indians
and
penhallow
replied
that
he
had
no
authority
to
surrender
them
on
this
they
gave
him
a
letter
to
the
governor
written
for
them
by
père
de
la
chasse
and
signed
by
their
totems
it
summoned
the
english
to
leave
the
country
at
once
and
threatened
to
rob
and
burn
their
houses
in
case
of
refusal
the
threat
was
not
executed
and
they
presently
disappeared
but
returned
in
september
in
increased
numbers
burned
houses
and
attacked
the
fort
in
which
the
inhabitants
had
sought
refuge
the
garrison
consisted
of
forty
men
who
being
reinforced
by
the
timely
arrival
of
several
bringing
thirty
more
made
a
sortie
a
skirmish
followed
but
being
outnumbered
and
outflanked
the
english
fell
back
behind
their
defences
the
french
authorities
were
in
a
difficult
position
they
thought
it
necessary
to
stop
the
progress
of
english
settlement
along
the
kennebec
and
yet
as
there
was
peace
between
the
two
crowns
they
could
not
use
open
force
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
set
on
the
abenakis
to
fight
for
them
i
am
well
pleased
wrote
vaudreuil
to
rale
that
you
and
père
de
la
chasse
have
prompted
the
indians
to
treat
the
english
as
they
have
done
my
orders
are
to
let
them
want
for
nothing
and
i
send
them
plenty
of
ammunition
rale
says
that
the
king
allowed
him
a
pension
of
six
thousand
livres
a
year
and
that
he
spent
it
all
in
good
works
as
his
statements
are
not
remarkable
for
precision
this
may
mean
that
he
was
charged
with
distributing
the
six
thousand
livres
which
the
king
gave
every
year
in
equal
shares
to
the
three
abenaki
missions
of
medoctec
norridgewock
and
panawamské
or
penobscot
and
which
generally
took
the
form
of
presents
of
arms
gunpowder
bullets
and
other
munitions
of
war
or
of
food
and
clothing
to
support
the
squaws
and
children
while
the
warriors
were
making
raids
on
the
english
vaudreuil
had
long
felt
the
delicacy
of
his
position
and
even
before
the
crisis
seemed
near
he
tried
to
provide
against
it
and
wrote
to
the
minister
that
he
had
never
called
the
abenakis
subjects
of
france
but
only
allies
in
order
to
avoid
responsibility
for
anything
they
might
do
the
english
he
says
elsewhere
must
be
prevented
from
settling
on
abenaki
lands
and
to
this
end
we
must
let
the
indians
act
for
us
agir
les
yet
while
urging
the
need
of
precaution
he
was
too
zealous
to
be
always
prudent
and
once
at
least
he
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
french
soldiers
should
be
sent
to
help
the
abenakis
which
he
thought
would
frighten
the
english
into
retreating
from
their
settlements
whereas
if
such
help
were
refused
the
indians
would
go
over
to
the
enemy
the
court
was
too
anxious
to
avoid
a
rupture
to
permit
the
use
of
open
force
and
would
only
promise
plenty
of
ammunition
to
indians
who
would
fight
the
english
directing
at
the
same
time
that
neither
favors
nor
attentions
should
be
given
to
those
who
would
not
the
officer
son
of
baron
vincent
de
by
his
wife
a
penobscot
squaw
bore
the
double
character
of
a
french
lieutenant
and
an
abenaki
chief
and
had
joined
with
the
indians
in
their
hostile
demonstration
at
arrowsick
island
therefore
as
chief
of
a
tribe
styled
subjects
of
king
george
the
english
seized
him
charged
him
with
rebellion
and
brought
him
to
boston
where
he
was
examined
by
a
legislative
committee
he
showed
both
tact
and
temper
parried
the
charges
against
him
and
was
at
last
set
at
liberty
his
arrest
however
exasperated
his
tribesmen
who
soon
began
to
burn
houses
kill
settlers
and
commit
various
acts
of
violence
for
all
of
which
rale
was
believed
to
be
mainly
answerable
there
was
great
indignation
against
him
he
himself
says
that
a
reward
of
a
thousand
pounds
sterling
was
offered
for
his
head
but
that
the
english
should
not
get
it
for
all
their
sterling
money
it
does
not
appear
that
such
a
reward
was
offered
though
it
is
true
that
the
massachusetts
house
of
representatives
once
voted
five
hundred
pounds
in
their
currency
then
equal
to
about
a
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
sterling
for
the
same
purpose
but
as
the
governor
and
council
refused
their
concurrence
the
act
was
of
no
effect
all
the
branches
of
the
government
however
presently
joined
in
sending
three
hundred
men
to
norridgewock
with
a
demand
that
the
indians
should
give
up
rale
and
the
other
heads
and
fomenters
of
their
rebellion
in
case
of
refusal
they
were
to
seize
the
jesuit
and
the
principal
chiefs
and
bring
them
prisoners
to
boston
colonel
westbrook
was
put
in
command
of
the
party
rale
being
warned
of
their
approach
by
some
of
his
indians
swallowed
the
consecrated
wafers
hid
the
sacred
vessels
and
made
for
the
woods
where
as
he
thinks
he
was
saved
from
discovery
by
a
special
intervention
of
providence
his
papers
fell
into
the
hands
of
westbrook
including
letters
that
proved
beyond
all
doubt
that
he
had
acted
as
agent
of
the
canadian
authorities
in
exciting
his
flock
against
the
english
incensed
by
westbrook
invasion
the
indians
came
down
the
kennebec
in
large
numbers
burned
the
village
of
brunswick
and
captured
nine
families
at
bay
though
they
soon
set
them
free
except
five
men
whom
they
kept
to
exchange
for
the
four
hostages
still
detained
at
boston
at
the
same
time
they
seized
several
small
vessels
in
the
harbors
along
the
coast
on
this
the
governor
and
council
declared
war
against
the
eastern
indians
meaning
the
abenakis
and
their
allies
whom
they
styled
traitors
and
robbers
in
massachusetts
many
persons
thought
that
war
could
not
be
justified
and
were
little
disposed
to
push
it
with
vigor
the
direction
of
it
belonged
to
the
governor
in
his
capacity
of
of
the
province
shute
was
an
old
soldier
who
had
served
with
credit
as
under
marlborough
but
he
was
hampered
by
one
of
those
disputes
which
in
times
of
crisis
were
sure
to
occur
in
every
british
province
whose
governor
was
appointed
by
the
crown
the
assembly
jealous
of
the
representative
of
royalty
and
looking
back
mournfully
to
their
virtual
independence
under
the
lamented
old
charter
had
from
the
first
let
slip
no
opportunity
to
increase
its
own
powers
and
abridge
those
of
the
governor
refused
him
the
means
of
establishing
the
promised
in
the
indian
country
and
would
grant
no
money
for
presents
to
conciliate
the
norridgewocks
the
house
now
wanted
not
only
to
control
supplies
for
the
war
but
to
direct
the
war
itself
and
conduct
operations
by
committees
of
its
own
shute
made
his
plans
of
campaign
and
proceeded
to
appoint
officers
from
among
the
frontier
inhabitants
who
had
at
least
the
qualification
of
being
accustomed
to
the
woods
one
of
them
colonel
walton
was
obnoxious
to
some
of
the
representatives
who
brought
charges
against
him
and
the
house
demanded
that
he
should
be
recalled
from
the
field
to
answer
to
them
for
his
conduct
the
governor
objected
to
this
as
an
encroachment
on
his
province
as
walton
was
now
accused
of
obeying
orders
of
the
governor
in
contravention
of
those
of
the
representatives
who
thereupon
passed
a
vote
requiring
him
to
lay
his
journal
before
them
this
was
more
than
shute
could
bear
he
had
the
character
of
a
man
but
the
difficulties
and
mortifications
of
his
position
had
long
galled
him
and
he
had
got
leave
to
return
to
england
and
lay
his
case
before
the
king
and
council
the
crisis
had
now
come
the
assembly
were
for
usurping
all
authority
civil
and
military
accordingly
on
the
first
of
january
the
governor
sailed
in
a
merchant
ship
for
london
without
giving
notice
of
his
intention
to
anybody
except
two
or
three
servants
the
burden
of
his
difficult
and
vexatious
office
fell
upon
the
william
dummer
when
he
first
met
the
council
in
his
new
capacity
a
whimsical
scene
took
place
here
among
the
rest
was
the
aged
matronly
countenance
of
the
worthy
samuel
sewall
deeply
impressed
with
the
dignity
and
importance
of
his
position
as
senior
member
of
the
board
at
his
best
he
never
had
the
faintest
sense
of
humor
or
perception
of
the
ludicrous
and
being
now
perhaps
touched
with
dotage
he
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
address
a
few
words
of
exhortation
and
encouragement
to
the
incoming
chief
magistrate
he
rose
from
his
seat
with
long
locks
limp
and
white
drooping
from
under
his
black
skullcap
for
he
abhorred
a
wig
as
a
sign
of
backsliding
and
in
a
voice
of
quavering
solemnity
spoke
thus
if
your
honour
and
this
honourable
board
please
to
give
me
leave
i
would
speak
a
word
or
two
upon
this
solemn
occasion
altho
the
unerring
providence
of
god
has
brought
you
to
the
chair
of
government
in
a
cloudy
and
tempestuous
season
yet
you
have
this
for
your
encouragement
that
the
people
you
have
to
do
with
are
a
part
of
the
israel
of
god
and
you
may
expect
to
have
of
the
prudence
and
patience
of
moses
communicated
to
you
for
your
conduct
it
is
evident
that
our
almighty
saviour
counselled
the
first
planters
to
remove
hither
and
settle
here
and
they
dutifully
followed
his
advice
and
therefore
he
will
never
leave
nor
forsake
them
nor
theirs
so
that
your
honour
must
needs
be
happy
in
sincerely
seeking
their
interest
and
welfare
which
your
birth
and
education
will
incline
you
to
do
quæ
i
promise
myself
that
they
who
sit
at
this
board
will
yield
their
faithful
advice
to
your
honour
according
to
the
duty
of
their
place
having
thus
delivered
himself
to
an
audience
not
much
more
susceptible
of
the
ludicrous
than
he
was
the
old
man
went
home
well
pleased
and
recorded
in
his
diary
that
the
and
councillors
rose
and
remained
standing
while
he
was
speaking
and
they
expressed
a
handsom
acceptance
of
what
i
had
said
dummer
was
born
in
new
england
and
might
therefore
expect
to
find
more
favor
than
had
fallen
to
his
predecessor
but
he
was
the
representative
of
royalty
and
could
not
escape
the
consequences
of
being
so
in
earnest
of
what
was
in
store
for
him
the
assembly
would
not
pay
his
salary
because
he
had
sided
with
the
governor
in
the
late
quarrel
the
house
voted
to
dismiss
colonel
walton
and
major
moody
the
chief
officers
appointed
by
shute
and
when
dummer
reminded
it
that
this
was
a
matter
belonging
to
him
as
it
withheld
the
pay
of
the
obnoxious
officers
and
refused
all
supplies
for
the
war
till
they
should
be
removed
dummer
was
forced
to
yield
the
house
would
probably
have
pushed
him
still
farther
if
the
members
had
not
dreaded
the
effect
of
shute
representations
at
court
and
feared
lest
persistent
encroachment
on
the
functions
of
the
governor
might
cost
them
their
charter
to
which
insufficient
as
they
thought
it
and
far
inferior
to
the
one
they
had
lost
they
clung
tenaciously
as
the
palladium
of
their
liberties
yet
dummer
needed
the
patience
of
job
for
his
assembly
seemed
more
bent
on
victories
over
him
than
over
the
indians
there
was
another
election
which
did
not
improve
the
situation
the
new
house
was
worse
than
the
old
being
made
up
largely
of
rustics
who
tried
to
relieve
the
governor
of
all
conduct
of
the
war
by
assigning
it
to
a
committee
chosen
from
among
themselves
but
the
council
would
not
concur
with
them
meanwhile
the
usual
ravages
went
on
farmhouses
were
burned
and
the
inmates
waylaid
and
killed
while
the
indians
generally
avoided
encounters
with
armed
bodies
of
whites
near
the
village
of
oxford
four
of
them
climbed
upon
the
roof
of
a
house
cut
a
hole
in
it
with
their
hatchets
and
tried
to
enter
a
woman
who
was
alone
in
the
building
and
who
had
two
loaded
guns
and
two
pistols
seeing
the
first
savage
struggling
to
shove
himself
through
the
hole
ran
to
him
in
desperation
and
shot
him
on
which
the
others
dragged
the
body
back
and
disappeared
there
were
several
attempts
of
a
more
serious
kind
the
small
wooden
fort
at
the
river
george
the
most
easterly
english
outpost
was
attacked
but
the
assailants
were
driven
off
a
few
weeks
later
it
was
attacked
again
by
the
penobscots
under
their
missionary
father
lauverjat
other
means
failing
they
tried
to
undermine
the
stockade
but
their
sap
caved
in
from
the
effect
of
rains
and
they
retreated
with
severe
loss
the
warlike
contagion
spread
to
the
indians
of
nova
scotia
in
july
the
micmacs
seized
sixteen
or
seventeen
at
canseau
on
which
john
eliot
of
boston
and
john
robinson
of
cape
ann
chased
the
marauders
in
two
sloops
retook
most
of
the
vessels
and
killed
a
good
number
of
the
indians
in
the
autumn
a
under
the
noted
chief
grey
lock
prowled
about
the
village
of
rutland
met
the
minister
joseph
willard
and
attacked
him
he
killed
one
savage
and
wounded
another
but
was
at
last
shot
and
scalped
the
representatives
had
long
been
bent
on
destroying
the
mission
village
of
the
penobscots
on
the
river
of
that
name
and
one
cause
of
their
grudge
against
colonel
walton
was
that
by
order
of
the
governor
he
had
deferred
a
projected
attack
upon
it
his
successor
colonel
westbrook
now
took
the
work
in
hand
went
up
the
penobscot
in
february
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
men
in
sloops
and
left
these
at
the
head
of
navigation
and
pushed
through
the
forest
to
the
indian
town
called
panawamské
by
the
french
it
stood
apparently
above
bangor
at
or
near
passadumkeag
here
the
party
found
a
stockade
enclosure
fourteen
feet
high
seventy
yards
long
and
fifty
yards
wide
containing
houses
which
westbrook
a
better
woodsman
than
grammarian
reports
to
have
been
built
regular
outside
the
stockade
stood
the
chapel
well
and
handsomely
furnished
within
and
without
and
on
the
south
side
of
that
the
fryer
this
fryer
was
father
lauverjat
who
had
led
his
flock
to
the
attack
of
the
fort
at
the
george
both
indians
and
missionary
were
gone
westbrook
men
burned
the
village
and
chapel
and
sailed
back
to
the
george
in
the
next
year
there
was
a
more
noteworthy
stroke
for
dummer
more
pliant
than
shute
had
so
far
soothed
his
assembly
that
it
no
longer
refused
money
for
the
war
it
was
resolved
to
strike
at
the
root
of
the
evil
seize
rale
and
destroy
norridgewock
two
hundred
and
eight
men
in
four
companies
under
captains
harmon
moulton
and
brown
and
lieutenant

set
out
from
fort
richmond
in
seventeen
whaleboats
on
the
eighth
of
august
they
left
the
boats
at
taconic
falls
in
charge
of
a
lieutenant
and
forty
men
and
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
the
main
body
accompanied
by
three
mohawk
indians
marched
through
the
forest
for
norridgewock
towards
evening
they
saw
two
squaws
one
of
whom
they
brutally
shot
and
captured
the
other
who
proved
to
be
the
wife
of
the
noted
chief
bomazeen
she
gave
them
a
full
account
of
the
state
of
the
village
which
they
approached
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
twelfth
in
the
belief
that
some
of
the
indians
would
be
in
their
cornfields
on
the
river
above
harmon
who
was
in
command
divided
the
force
and
moved
up
the
river
with
about
eighty
men
while
moulton
with
as
many
more
made
for
the
village
advancing
through
the
forest
with
all
possible
silence
about
three
he
and
his
men
emerged
from
a
tangle
of
trees
and
bushes
and
saw
the
norridgewock
cabins
before
them
no
longer
enclosed
with
a
stockade
but
open
and
unprotected
not
an
indian
was
stirring
till
at
length
a
warrior
came
out
from
one
of
the
huts
saw
the
english
gave
a
startled
and
ran
back
for
his
gun
then
all
was
dismay
and
confusion
squaws
and
children
ran
screaming
for
the
river
while
the
warriors
fifty
or
sixty
in
number
came
to
meet
the
enemy
moulton
ordered
his
men
to
reserve
their
fire
till
the
indians
had
emptied
their
guns
as
he
had
foreseen
the
excited
savages
fired
wildly
and
did
little
or
no
harm
the
english
still
keeping
their
ranks
returned
a
volley
with
deadly
effect
the
indians
gave
one
more
fire
and
then
ran
for
the
river
some
tried
to
wade
to
the
farther
side
the
water
being
low
others
swam
across
while
many
jumped
into
their
canoes
but
could
not
use
them
having
left
the
paddles
in
their
houses
moulton
men
followed
close
shooting
the
fugitives
in
the
water
or
as
they
climbed
the
farther
bank
when
they
returned
to
the
village
they
found
rale
in
one
of
the
houses
firing
upon
some
of
their
comrades
who
had
not
joined
in
the
pursuit
he
presently
wounded
one
of
them
on
which
a
lieutenant
named
benjamin
jaques
burst
open
the
door
of
the
house
and
as
he
declared
found
the
priest
loading
his
gun
for
another
shot
the
lieutenant
said
further
that
he
called
on
him
to
surrender
and
that
rale
replied
that
he
would
neither
give
quarter
nor
take
it
on
which
jaques
shot
him
through
the
head
moulton
who
had
given
orders
that
rale
should
not
be
killed
doubted
this
report
of
his
subordinate
so
far
as
concerned
the
language
used
by
rale
though
believing
that
he
had
exasperated
the
lieutenant
by
provoking
expressions
of
some
kind
the
old
chief
mogg
had
shut
himself
up
in
another
house
from
which
he
fired
and
killed
one
of
three
mohawks
whose
brother
then
beat
in
the
door
and
shot
the
chief
dead
several
of
the
english
followed
and
brutally
murdered
squaw
and
his
two
children
such
plunder
as
the
village
afforded
consisting
of
three
barrels
of
gunpowder
with
a
few
guns
blankets
and
kettles
was
then
seized
and
the
puritan
militia
thought
it
a
meritorious
act
to
break
what
they
called
the
idols
in
the
church
and
carry
off
the
sacred
vessels
harmon
and
his
party
returned
towards
night
from
their
useless
excursion
to
the
cornfields
where
they
found
nobody
in
the
morning
a
search
was
made
for
the
dead
and
indians
were
found
and
scalped
including
the
principal
chiefs
and
warriors
of
the
place
then
being
anxious
for
the
safety
of
their
boats
the
party
marched
for
taconic
falls
they
had
scarcely
left
the
village
when
one
of
the
two
surviving
mohawks
named
christian
secretly
turned
back
set
fire
to
the
church
and
the
houses
and
then
rejoined
the
party
the
boats
were
found
safe
and
embarking
they
rowed
down
to
richmond
with
their
trophies
the
news
of
the
fate
of
the
jesuit
and
his
mission
spread
joy
among
the
border
settlers
who
saw
in
it
the
end
of
their
troubles
in
their
eyes
rale
was
an
incendiary
setting
on
a
horde
of
bloody
savages
to
pillage
and
murder
while
they
thought
him
a
devil
he
passed
in
canada
for
a
martyred
saint
he
was
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
a
man
with
the
qualities
and
faults
of
a
man
fearless
resolute
enduring
boastful
sarcastic
often
bitter
and
irritating
a
vehement
partisan
apt
to
see
things
not
as
they
were
but
as
he
wished
them
to
be
given
to
inaccuracy
and
exaggeration
yet
no
doubt
sincere
in
opinions
and
genuine
in
zeal
hating
the
english
more
than
he
loved
the
indians
calling
himself
their
friend
yet
using
them
as
instruments
of
worldly
policy
to
their
danger
and
final
ruin
in
considering
the
ascription
of
martyrdom
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
he
did
not
die
because
he
was
an
apostle
of
the
faith
but
because
he
was
the
active
agent
of
the
canadian
government
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
he
sometimes
exercised
a
humanizing
influence
over
his
flock
the
war
which
he
helped
to
kindle
was
marked
by
fewer
barbarities
fewer
tortures
mutilations
of
the
dead
and
butcheries
of
women
and
infants
than
either
of
the
preceding
wars
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
this
was
due
in
part
to
him
though
it
was
chiefly
the
result
of
an
order
given
at
the
outset
by
shute
that
in
exposed
positions
should
be
sent
to
places
of
safety
in
the
older
settlements
footnotes

was
an
agreement
under
the
treaty
of

who

announced

by

volley
riddling

says

tan
out
to
save
his
flock
by
drawing
the
rage
of
the
enemy
on
himself
on
which
they
raised
a
great
shout
and
shot
him
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
in
the
middle
of
the
village
la
chasse
does
not
tell
us
where
he
got
the
story
but
as
there
were
no
french
witnesses
the
story
must
have
come
from
the
indians
who
are
notorious
liars
where
their
interest
and
are
concerned
nobody
competent
to
judge
of
evidence
can
doubt
which
of
the
two
statements
is
the
more
trustworthy
it
is
also
said
that
rale
taught
some
of
his
indians
to
read
and
write
which
was
unusual
in
the
jesuit
missions
on
his
character

vaudreuil
turned

against
the

of

whose
peaceful

had

soon
after

expedition
dummer
wrote
to
the
french
governor
who
had
lately
proclaimed
the
abenakis
his
allies
as
they
are
subjects
of
his
britannic
majesty
they
can
not
be
your
allies
except
through
me
his
representative
you
have
instigated
them
to
fall
on
our
people
in
the
most
outrageous
manner
i
have
seen
your
commission
to
sebastien
rale
but
for
your
protection
and
incitements
they
would
have
made
peace
long
ago
in
reply
vaudreuil
admitted
that
he
had
given
a
and
a
commission
to
rale
which
he
could
not
deny
as
the
jesuit
papers
were
in
the
hands
of
the
english
governor
you
will
have
to
answer
to
your
king
for
his
murder
he
tells
dummer
it
would
have
been
strange
if
i
had
abandoned
our
indians
to
please
you
i
can
not
help
taking
the
part
of
our
allies
you
have
brought
your
troubles
upon
yourself
i
advise
you
to
pull
down
all
the
forts
you
have
built
on
the
abenaki
lands
since
the
peace
of
utrecht
if
you
do
so
i
will
be
your
mediator
with
the
norridgewocks
as
to
the
murder
of
rale
i
leave
that
to
be
settled
between
the
two
crowns
apparently
the
french
court
thought
it
wise
to
let
the
question
rest
and
make
no
complaint
dummer
however
gave
his
views
on
the
subject
to
vaudreuil
instead
of
preaching
peace
love
and
friendship
agreeably
to
the
christian
religion
rale
was
an
incendiary
as
appears
by
many
letters
i
have
by
me
he
has
once
and
again
appeared
at
the
head
of
a
great
many
indians
threatening
and
insulting
us
if
such
a
disturber
of
the
peace
has
been
killed
in
the
heat
of
action
nobody
is
to
blame
but
himself
i
have
much
more
cause
to
complain
that
willard
minister
of
rutland
who
is
innocent
of
all
that
is
charged
against
rale
and
always
confined
himself
to
preaching
the
gospel
was
slain
and
scalped
by
your
indians
and
his
scalp
carried
in
triumph
to
quebec
dummer
then
denies
that
france
has
any
claim
to
the
abenakis
and
declares
that
the
war
between
them
and
the
english
is
due
to
the
instigations
of
rale
and
the
encouragements
given
them
by
vaudreuil
but
he
adds
that
in
his
wish
to
promote
peace
he
sends
two
prominent
gentlemen
colonel
samuel
thaxter
and
colonel
william
dudley
as
bearers
of
his
letter
atkinson
envoy
on
the
part
of
new
hampshire
joined
thaxter
and
dudley
and
the
three
set
out
for
montreal
over
the
ice
of
lake
champlain
vaudreuil
received
them
with
courtesy
as
required
by
their
instructions
they
demanded
the
release
of
the
english
prisoners
in
canada
and
protested
against
the
action
of
the
french
governor
in
setting
on
the
indians
to
attack
english
settlements
when
there
was
peace
between
the
two
crowns
vaudreuil
denied
that
he
had
done
so
till
they
showed
him
his
own
letters
to
rale
captured
at
norridgewock
these
were
unanswerable
but
vaudreuil
insisted
that
the
supplies
sent
to
the
indians
were
only
the
presents
which
they
received
every
year
from
the
king
as
to
the
english
prisoners
he
said
that
those
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
were
beyond
his
power
but
that
the
envoys
could
have
those
whom
the
french
had
bought
from
their
captors
on
paying
back
the
price
they
had
cost
the
demands
were
exorbitant
but
sixteen
prisoners
were
ransomed
and
bargains
were
made
for
ten
more
vaudreuil
proposed
to
thaxter
and
his
colleagues
to
have
an
interview
with
the
indians
which
they
at
first
declined
saying
that
they
had
no
powers
to
treat
with
them
though
if
the
indians
wished
to
ask
for
peace
they
were
ready
to
hear
them
at
length
a
meeting
was
arranged
the
french
governor
writes
being
satisfied
that
nothing
was
more
opposed
to
our
interests
than
a
peace
between
the
abenakis
and
the
english
i
thought
that
i
would
sound
the
chiefs
before
they
spoke
to
the
english
envoys
and
insinuate
to
them
everything
that
i
had
to
say
this
he
did
with
such
success
that
instead
of
asking
for
peace
the
indians
demanded
the
demolition
of
the
english
forts
and
heavy
damages
for
burning
their
church
and
killing
their
missionary
in
short
to
vaudreuil
great
satisfaction
they
talked
nothing
but
war
the
french
despatch
reporting
this
interview
has
the
following
marginal
note
nothing
better
can
be
done
than
to
foment
this
war
which
at
least
retards
the
settlements
of
the
english
and
against
this
is
written
in
the
hand
of
the
colonial
minister
the
word
this
was
in
fact
the
policy
pursued
from
the
first
and
rale
had
been
an
instrument
of
it
the
jesuit
la
chasse
who
spoke
both
english
and
abenaki
had
acted
as
interpreter
and
so
had
had
the
meeting
in
his
power
as
he
could
make
both
parties
say
what
he
pleased
the
envoys
thought
him
more
than
vaudreuil
himself
and
ascribed
the
intractable
mood
of
the
indians
to
his
devices
under
the
circumstances
they
made
a
mistake
in
consenting
to
the
interview
at
all
the
governor
who
had
treated
them
with
civility
throughout
gave
them
an
escort
of
soldiers
for
the
homeward
journey
and
they
and
the
redeemed
prisoners
returned
safely
to
albany
the
war
went
on
as
before
but
the
indians
were
fast
growing
tired
of
it
the
penobscots
had
made
themselves
obnoxious
by
their
attacks
on
fort
george
and
captain
heath
marched
across
country
from
the
kennebec
to
punish
them
he
found
their
village
empty
it
was
built

at
or
near
the
site
of
bangor
a
little
below
indian
old
town
the
present
abode
of
the
tribe
and
consisted
of
fifty
wigwams
which
heath
men
burned
to
the
ground
one
of
the
four
hostages
still
detained
at
boston
together
with
another
indian
captured
in
the
war
was
allowed
to
visit
his
people
under
a
promise
to
return
strange
to
say
the
promise
was
kept
they
came
back
bringing
a
request
for
peace
from
their
tribesmen
on
this
commissioners
were
sent
to
the
george
where
a
conference
was
held
with
some
of
the
penobscot
chiefs
and
it
was
arranged
that
deputies
of
that
people
should
be
sent
to
boston
to
conclude
a
solid
peace
after
long
delay
four
chiefs
appeared
fully
empowered
as
they
said
to
make
peace
not
for
the
penobscots
only
but
for
the
other
abenaki
tribes
their
allies
the
speeches
and
ceremonies
being
at
last
ended
the
four
deputies
affixed
their
marks
to
a
paper
in
which
for
themselves
and
those
they
represented
they
made
submission
unto
his
most
excellent
majesty
george
by
the
grace
of
god
king
of
great
britain
france
and
ireland
defender
of
the
faith
promising
to
cease
and
forbear
all
acts
of
hostility
injuries
and
discord
towards
all
his
subjects
and
never
confederate
or
combine
with
any
other
nation
to
their
prejudice
here
was
a
curious
anomaly
the
english
claimed
the
abenakis
as
subjects
of
the
british
crown
and
at
the
same
time
treated
with
them
as
a
foreign
power
each
of
the
four
deputies
signed
the
paper
one
with
the
likeness
of
a
turtle
the
next
with
that
of
a
bird
the
third
with
the
untutored
portrait
of
a
beaver
and
the
fourth
with
an
extraordinary
scrawl
meant
it
seems
for
a
lobster
such
being
their
respective
totems
to
these
the
added
the
seal
of
the
province
of
massachusetts
coupled
with
his
own
autograph
in
the
next
summer
and
again
a
year
later
other
meetings
were
held
at
casco
bay
with
the
chiefs
of
the
various
abenaki
tribes
in
which
after
prodigious
circumlocution
the
boston
treaty
was
ratified
and
the
war
ended
this
time
the
massachusetts
assembly
taught
wisdom
by
experience
furnished
a
guarantee
of
peace
by
providing
for
government
in
the
indian
country
where
goods
were
supplied
through
responsible
hands
at
honest
prices
the
norridgewocks
with
whom
the
quarrel
began
were
completely
broken
some
of
the
survivors
joined
their
kindred
in
canada
and
others
were
merged
in
the
abenaki
bands
of
the
penobscot
saco
or
androscoggin
peace
reigned
at
last
along
the
borders
of
new
england
but
it
had
cost
her
dear
in
the
year
after
the
death
of
rale
there
was
an
incident
of
the
conflict
too
noted
in
its
day
and
too
strongly
rooted
in
popular
tradition
to
be
passed
unnoticed
out
of
the
heart
of
the
white
mountains
springs
the
river
saco
fed
by
the
bright
cascades
that
leap
from
the
crags
of
mount
webster
brawling
among
rocks
and
bowlders
down
the
great
defile
of
the
crawford
notch
winding
through
the
forests
and
intervales
of
conway
then
circling
northward
by
the
village
of
fryeburg
in
devious
wanderings
by
meadows
woods
and
mountains
and
at
last
turning
eastward
and
southward
to
join
the
sea
on
the
banks
of
this
erratic
stream
lived
an
abenaki
tribe
called
the
sokokis
when
the
first
white
man
visited
the
country
these
indians
lived
at
the
falls
a
few
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
they
retired
before
the
english
settlers
and
either
joined
their
kindred
in
maine
or
migrated
to
francis
and
other
abenaki
settlements
in
canada
but
a
sokoki
band
called
pigwackets
or
pequawkets
still
kept
its
place
far
in
the
interior
on
the
upper
waters
of
the
saco
near
pine
hill
in
the
present
town
of
fryeburg
except
a
small
band
of
their
near
kindred
on
lake
ossipee
they
were
the
only
human
tenants
of
a
wilderness
many
thousand
square
miles
in
extent
in
their
wild
and
remote
abode
they
were
difficult
of
access
and
the
forest
and
the
river
were
well
stocked
with
moose
deer
bear
beaver
otter
lynx
fisher
mink
and
marten
in
this
their
happy
the
pequawkets
thought
themselves
safe
and
they
would
have
been
so
for
some
time
longer
if
they
had
not
taken
up
the
quarrel
of
the
norridgewocks
and
made
bloody
raids
against
the
english
border
under
their
paugus
not
far
from
where
their
wigwams
stood
clustered
in
a
bend
of
the
saco
was
the
small
lake
now
called
lovewell
pond
named
for
john
lovewell
of
dunstable
a
massachusetts
town
on
the
new
hampshire
line
father
a
person
of
consideration
in
the
village
where
he
owned
a
garrison
house
had
served
in
philip
war
and
taken
part
in
the
famous
narragansett
swamp
fight
the
younger
lovewell
now
about
years
of
age
lived
with
his
wife
hannah
and
two
or
three
children
on
a
farm
of
two
hundred
acres
the
inventory
of
his
effects
made
after
his
death
includes
five
or
six
cattle
one
mare
two
steel
traps
with
chains
a
gun
two
or
three
books
a
and
or
mattress
along
with
sundry
tools
pots
barrels
chests
tubs
and
the
like
the
equipment
in
short
of
a
decent
frontier
yeoman
of
the
time
but
being
like
the
tough
veteran
his
father
of
a
bold
and
adventurous
disposition
he
seems
to
have
been
less
given
to
farming
than
to
hunting
and
dunstable
was
attacked
by
indians
in
the
autumn
of
and
two
men
were
carried
off
ten
others
went
in
pursuit
but
fell
into
an
ambush
and
nearly
all
were
killed
josiah
farwell
lovewell
being
by
some
accounts
the
only
one
who
escaped
soon
after
this
a
petition
styled
a
humble
memorial
was
laid
before
the
house
of
representatives
at
boston
it
declares
that
in
order
to
kill
and
destroy
their
enemy
indians
the
petitioners
and
forty
or
fifty
others
are
ready
to
spend
one
whole
year
in
hunting
them
provided
they
can
meet
with
encouragement
suitable
the
petition
is
signed
by
john
lovewell
josiah
farwell
and
jonathan
robbins
all
of
dunstable
lovewell
name
being
well
written
and
the
others
after
a
cramped
and
unaccustomed
fashion
the
representatives
accepted
the
proposal
and
voted
to
give
each
adventurer
two
shillings
and
sixpence
a
day
then
equal
in
massachusetts
currency
to
about
one
english
shilling
out
of
which
he
was
to
maintain
himself
the
men
were
in
addition
promised
large
rewards
for
the
scalps
of
male
indians
old
enough
to
fight
a
company
of
thirty
was
soon
raised
lovewell
was
chosen
captain
farwell
lieutenant
and
robbins
ensign
they
set
out
towards
the
end
of
november
and
reappeared
at
dunstable
early
in
january
bringing
one
prisoner
and
one
scalp
towards
the
end
of
the
month
lovewell
set
out
again
this
time
with
men
gathered
from
the
villages
of
dunstable
groton
lancaster
haverhill
and
billerica
they
ascended
the
frozen
merrimac
passed
lake
winnepesaukee
pushed
nearly
to
the
white
mountains
and
encamped
on
a
branch
of
the
upper
saco
here
they
killed
a
moose
a
timely
piece
of
luck
for
they
were
in
danger
of
starvation
and
lovewell
had
been
compelled
by
want
of
food
to
send
back
a
good
number
of
his
men
the
rest
held
their
way
filing
on
through
the
deathlike
solitude
that
gave
no
sign
of
life
except
the
light
track
of
some
squirrel
on
the
snow
and
the
brisk
note
of
the
hardy
little
chickadee
or
titmouse
so
familiar
to
the
winter
woods
thus
far
the
scouts
had
seen
no
human
footprint
but
on
the
twentieth
of
february
they
found
a
lately
abandoned
wigwam
and
following
the
tracks
that
led
from
it
at
length
saw
smoke
rising
at
a
distance
out
of
the
gray
forest
the
party
lay
close
till
two
in
the
morning
then
cautiously
approached
found
one
or
more
wigwams
surrounded
them
and
killed
all
the
inmates
ten
in
number
they
were
warriors
from
canada
on
a
winter
raid
against
the
borders
lovewell
and
his
men
it
will
be
seen
were
much
like
hunters
of
wolves
catamounts
or
other
dangerous
beasts
except
that
the
chase
of
this
fierce
and
wily
human
game
demanded
far
more
hardihood
and
skill
they
brought
home
the
scalps
in
triumph
together
with
the
blankets
and
the
new
guns
furnished
to
the
slain
warriors
by
their
canadian
friends
and
lovewell
began
at
once
to
gather
men
for
another
hunt
the
busy
season
of
the
farmers
was
at
hand
and
volunteers
came
in
less
freely
than
before
at
the
middle
of
april
however
he
had
raised
a
band
of
of
whom
he
was
the
captain
with
farwell
and
robbins
as
his
lieutenants
though
they
were
all
regularly
commissioned
by
the
governor
they
were
leaders
rather
than
commanders
for
they
and
their
men
were
neighbors
or
acquaintances
on
terms
of
entire
social
equality
two
of
the
number
require
mention
one
was
seth
wyman
of
woburn
an
ensign
and
the
other
was
jonathan
frye
of
andover
the
chaplain
a
youth
of
graduated
at
harvard
college
in
and
now
a
student
of
theology
chaplain
though
he
was
he
carried
a
gun
knife
and
hatchet
like
the
others
and
not
one
of
the
party
was
more
prompt
to
use
them
they
began
their
march
on
april
a
few
days
afterwards
one
william
cummings
of
dunstable
became
so
disabled
by
the
effects
of
a
wound
received
from
indians
some
time
before
that
he
could
not
keep
on
with
the
rest
and
lovewell
sent
him
back
in
charge
of
a
kinsman
thus
reducing
their
number
to
when
they
reached
the
west
shore
of
lake
ossipee
benjamin
kidder
of
nutfield
fell
seriously
to
leave
him
defenceless
in
a
place
so
dangerous
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
his
comrades
built
a
small
fort
or
palisaded
near
the
water
where
they
left
the
sick
man
in
charge
of
the
surgeon
together
with
sergeant
woods
and
a
guard
of
seven
men
the
rest
now
reduced
to
continued
their
march
through
the
forest
northeastward
towards
pequawket
while
the
savage
heights
of
the
white
mountains
still
covered
with
snow
rose
above
the
dismal
bare
forests
on
their
left
they
seem
to
have
crossed
the
saco
just
below
the
site
of
fryeburg
and
in
the
night
of
may
as
they
lay
in
the
woods
near
the
northeast
end
of
lovewell
pond
the
men
on
guard
heard
sounds
like
indians
prowling
about
them
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
as
they
stood
bareheaded
listening
to
a
prayer
from
the
young
chaplain
they
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
and
soon
after
discovered
an
indian
on
the
shore
of
the
pond
at
a
considerable
distance
apparently
he
was
shooting
ducks
but
lovewell
suspecting
a
device
to
lure
them
into
an
ambuscade
asked
the
men
whether
they
were
for
pushing
forward
or
falling
back
and
with
one
voice
they
called
upon
him
to
lead
them
on
they
were
then
in
a
piece
of
open
pine
woods
traversed
by
a
small
brook
he
ordered
them
to
lay
down
their
packs
and
advance
with
extreme
caution
they
had
moved
forward
for
some
time
in
this
manner
when
they
met
an
indian
coming
towards
them
through
the
dense
trees
and
bushes
he
no
sooner
saw
them
than
he
fired
at
the
leading
men
his
gun
was
charged
with
but
he
was
so
near
his
mark
that
the
effect
was
equal
to
that
of
a
bullet
and
he
severely
wounded
lovewell
and
one
whiting
on
which
seth
wyman
shot
him
dead
and
the
chaplain
and
another
man
scalped
him
lovewell
though
believed
to
be
mortally
hurt
was
still
able
to
walk
and
the
party
fell
back
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
their
packs
the
packs
had
disappeared
and
suddenly
with
frightful
yells
the
whole
body
of
the
pequawket
warriors
rushed
from
their
firing
as
they
came
on
the
survivors
say
that
they
were
more
than
twice
the
number
of
the
whites
which
is
probably
an
exaggeration
though
their
conduct
so
unusual
with
indians
in
rushing
forward
instead
of
firing
from
their
ambush
shows
a
remarkable
confidence
in
their
numerical
strength
they
no
doubt
expected
to
strike
their
enemies
with
a
panic
lovewell
received
another
mortal
wound
but
he
fired
more
than
once
on
the
indians
as
he
lay
dying
his
two
lieutenants
farwell
and
robbins
were
also
badly
hurt
eight
others
fell
but
the
rest
stood
their
ground
and
pushed
the
indians
so
hard
that
they
drove
them
back
to
cover
with
heavy
loss
one
man
played
the
coward
benjamin
hassell
of
dunstable
who
ran
off
escaped
in
the
confusion
and
made
with
his
best
speed
for
the
fort
at
lake
ossipee
the
situation
of
the
party
was
desperate
and
nothing
saved
them
from
destruction
but
the
prompt
action
of
their
surviving
officers
only
one
of
whom
ensign
wyman
had
escaped
unhurt
it
was
probably
under
his
direction
that
the
men
fell
back
steadily
to
the
shore
of
the
pond
which
was
only
a
few
rods
distant
here
the
water
protected
their
rear
so
that
they
could
not
be
surrounded
and
now
followed
one
of
the
most
obstinate
and
deadly
in
the
annals
of
new
england
it
was
about
ten
when
the
fight
began
and
it
lasted
till
night
the
indians
had
the
greater
agility
and
skill
in
hiding
and
sheltering
themselves
and
the
whites
the
greater
steadiness
and
coolness
in
using
their
guns
they
fought
in
the
shade
for
the
forest
was
dense
and
all
alike
covered
themselves
as
they
best
could
behind
trees
bushes
or
fallen
trunks
where
each
man
crouched
with
eyes
and
mind
intent
firing
whenever
he
saw
or
thought
he
saw
the
head
limbs
or
body
of
an
enemy
exposed
to
sight
for
an
instant
the
indians
howled
like
wolves
yelled
like
enraged
cougars
and
made
the
forest
ring
with
their
whoops
while
the
whites
replied
with
shouts
and
cheers
at
one
time
the
indians
ceased
firing
and
drew
back
among
the
trees
and
undergrowth
where
by
the
noise
they
made
they
seemed
to
be
holding
a
or
incantation
to
procure
victory
but
the
keen
and
fearless
seth
wyman
crept
up
among
the
bushes
shot
the
chief
conjurer
and
broke
up
the
meeting
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
young
frye
received
a
mortal
wound
unable
to
fight
longer
he
lay
in
his
blood
praying
from
time
to
time
for
his
comrades
in
a
faint
but
audible
voice
solomon
keyes
of
billerica
received
two
wounds
but
fought
on
till
a
third
shot
struck
him
he
then
crawled
up
to
wyman
in
the
heat
of
the
fight
and
told
him
that
he
keyes
was
a
dead
man
but
that
the
indians
should
not
get
his
scalp
if
he
could
help
it
creeping
along
the
sandy
edge
of
the
pond
he
chanced
to
find
a
stranded
canoe
pushed
it
afloat
rolled
himself
into
it
and
drifted
away
before
the
wind
soon
after
sunset
the
indians
drew
off
and
left
the
field
to
their
enemies
living
and
dead
not
even
stopping
to
scalp
the
fallen
a
remarkable
proof
of
the
completeness
of
their
discomfiture
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
hunger
for
having
lost
their
packs
in
the
morning
they
had
no
food
the
surviving
white
men
explored
the
scene
of
the
fight
jacob
farrar
lay
gasping
his
last
by
the
edge
of
the
water
robert
usher
and
lieutenant
robbins
were
unable
to
move
of
the
men
nine
had
escaped
without
serious
injury
eleven
were
badly
wounded
and
the
rest
were
dead
or
dying
except
the
coward
who
had
run
off
about
midnight
an
hour
or
more
before
the
setting
of
the
moon
such
as
had
strength
to
walk
left
the
ground
robbins
as
he
lay
helpless
asked
one
of
them
to
load
his
gun
saying
the
indians
will
come
in
the
morning
to
scalp
me
and
i
kill
another
of
if
i
can
they
loaded
the
gun
and
left
him
to
make
one
way
even
by
daylight
through
the
snares
and
pitfalls
of
a
new
england
forest
is
often
a
difficult
task
to
do
so
in
the
darkness
of
night
and
overshadowing
boughs
among
the
fallen
trees
and
the
snarl
of
underbrush
was
wellnigh
impossible
any
but
the
most
skilful
woodsmen
would
have
lost
their
way
the
indians
sick
of
fighting
did
not
molest
the
party
after
struggling
on
for
a
mile
or
more
farwell
frye
and
two
other
wounded
men
josiah
jones
and
eleazer
davis
could
go
no
farther
and
with
their
consent
the
others
left
them
with
a
promise
to
send
them
help
as
soon
as
they
should
reach
the
fort
in
the
morning
the
men
divided
into
several
small
bands
the
better
to
elude
pursuit
one
of
these
parties
was
tracked
for
some
time
by
the
indians
and
elias
barron
becoming
separated
from
his
companions
was
never
again
heard
of
though
the
case
of
his
gun
was
afterwards
found
by
the
bank
of
the
river
ossipee
eleven
of
the
number
at
length
reached
the
fort
and
to
their
amazement
found
nobody
there
the
runaway
hassell
had
arrived
many
hours
before
them
and
to
excuse
his
flight
told
so
frightful
a
story
of
the
fate
of
his
comrades
that
his
hearers
were
seized
with
a
panic
shamefully
abandoned
their
post
and
set
out
for
the
settlements
leaving
a
writing
on
a
piece
of
to
the
effect
that
all
the
rest
were
killed
they
had
left
a
supply
of
bread
and
pork
and
while
the
famished
eleven
rested
and
refreshed
themselves
they
were
joined
by
solomon
keyes
the
man
who
after
being
thrice
wounded
had
floated
away
in
a
canoe
from
the
place
of
the
fight
after
drifting
for
a
considerable
distance
the
wind
blew
him
ashore
when
spurred
by
necessity
and
feeling
himself
wonderfully
strengthened
he
succeeded
in
gaining
the
fort
meanwhile
frye
farwell
and
their
two
wounded
companions
davis
and
jones
after
waiting
vainly
for
the
expected
help
found
strength
to
struggle
forward
again
till
the
chaplain
stopped
and
lay
down
begging
the
others
to
keep
on
their
way
and
saying
to
davis
tell
my
father
that
i
expect
in
a
few
hours
to
be
in
eternity
and
am
not
afraid
to
die
they
left
him
and
says
the
old
narrative
he
has
not
been
heard
of
since
he
had
kept
the
journal
of
the
expedition
which
was
lost
with
him
farwell
died
of
exhaustion
the
remaining
two
lost
their
way
and
became
separated
after
wandering
eleven
days
davis
reached
the
fort
at
lake
ossipee
and
finding
food
there
came
into
berwick
on
the
jones
after
fourteen
days
in
the
woods
arrived
half
dead
at
the
village
of
biddeford
some
of
the
eleven
who
had
first
made
their
way
to
the
fort

he
was
ill

one
of

who
had
been
in

and
had
just
returned
offered
to

in

place
when
the

reached
the
scene
of

they
saw
the

plentifully
scarred
with

presently
found
and
buried

of

ten
others

after
their

custom
had
carried
off

their

discovered
three
of

buried
together
and
one
of

was
recognized
as

some
of
them
joined
their
abenaki

in

and
remained
there

others
returned
after
the

has

that

thought
her
beneath
him
in
education

position
but
this
is
not
likely
for
her
father
belonged
to
what
has
been
called
the
brahmin
caste
of
new
england
and
like
others
of
his
family
had
had
at
harvard
the
best
education
that
the
country
could
supply
the
girl
herself
though
only
fourteen
years
old
could
make
verses
such
as
they
were
and
she
wrote
an
elegy
on
the
death
of
her
lover
which
bating
some
grammatical
lapses
deserves
the
modest
praise
of
being
no
worse
than
many
new
england
rhymes
of
that
day
the
courage
of
frye
and
his
sturdy
comrades
contributed
greatly
to
the

in

to
clean
their

hot
and

he

his

he
shot
dead

the

that

some
hours
before
was

drew
off
into

conflict

in

the
conflict

the

and
the
conflict
for

could
not

to
take
at

an
international
character
being
essentially
a
competition

the
only
one
of
the
english

took
an
active
part
in
it
the
province
of
new
york
alone
among
her
sister
communities
she
had
a
natural
thoroughfare
to
the
west
not
comparable
however
with
that
of
canada
to
whose
people
the
lawrence
the
great
lakes
and
their
tributary
waters
were
a
continual
invitation
to

virginia
and
pennsylvania
were
not
yet
serious
rivals
in

and
new
england
the
most
active
of
the
british
colonies
was
barred
out
from
it
by
the
interposition
of
new
york
which
lay
across
her
westward
path
thus
forcing
her
to
turn
her
energies
to
the
sea
where
half
a
century
later
her
achievements
inspired
the
glowing
panegyrics
of
burke
before
the
house
of
commons
new
york
then
was
for
many
years
the
only
rival
of
canada
for
the
control
of
the
west
it
was
a
fatal
error
in
the
rulers
of
new
france
that
they
did
not
in
the
seventeenth
century
use
more
strenuous
efforts
to
possess
themselves
by
purchase
exchange
or
conquest
of
this
troublesome
and
dangerous
neighbor
there
was
a
time
under
the
reign
of
charles
when
negotiation
for
the
purchase
of
new
york
might
have
been
successful
and
if
this
failed
the
conquest
of
the
province
if
attempted
by
forces
equal
to
the
importance
of
the
object
would
have
been
far
from
hopeless
with
new
york
in
french
hands
the
fate
of
the
continent
would
probably
have
been
changed
the
british
possessions
would
have
been
cut
in
two
new
england
isolated
and
placed
in
constant
jeopardy
would
have
vainly
poured
her
unmanageable
herds
of
raw
militia
against
the
disciplined
veterans
of
old
france
intrenched
at
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
canada
would
have
gained
complete
control
of
her
old
enemies
the
iroquois
who
would
have
been
wholly
dependent
on
her
for
the
arms
and
ammunition
without
which
they
could
do
nothing
the
iroquois
as
the
french
had
been
accustomed
to
call
them
were
known
to
the
english
as
the
five
nations
a
name
which
during
the
eighteenth
century
the
french
also
adopted
soon
after
the
peace
of
utrecht
a
kindred
tribe
the
tuscaroras
was
joined
to
the
original
five
members
of
the
confederacy
which
thenceforward
was
sometimes
called
the
six
nations
though
the
tuscaroras
were
never
very
prominent
in
its
history
and
to
avoid
confusion
we
will
keep
the
more
familiar
name
of
the
five
nations
which
the
french
used
to
the
last
for
more
than
two
generations
this
league
of
tribes
had
held
canada
in
terror
and
more
than
once
threatened
it
with
destruction
but
now
a
change
had
come
over
the
confederates
count
frontenac
had
humbled
their
pride
they
were
crowded
between
the
rival
european
nations
both
of
whom
they
distrusted
their
traditional
hatred
of
the
french
would
have
given
the
english
of
new
york
a
controlling
influence
over
them
if
the
advantage
had
been
used
with
energy
and
tact
but
a
narrow
and
conduct
threw
it
away
a
governor
of
new
york
moreover
even
were
he
as
keen
and
as
frontenac
himself
would
often
have
been
helpless
when
the
five
nations
were
attacked
by
the
french
he
had
no
troops
to
defend
them
nor
could
he
like
a
canadian
governor
call
out
the
forces
of
his
province
by
a
word
to
meet
the
exigency
the
small
revenues
of
new
york
were
not
at
his
disposal
without
the
votes
of
the
frugal
representatives
of
an
impoverished
people
his
hands
were
tied
hence
the
five
nations
often
left
unaided
when
they
most
needed
help
looked
upon
their
dutch
and
english
neighbors
as
slothful
and
unwarlike
yet
their
friendship
was
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
province
in
peace
as
well
as
in
war
and
was
indispensable
in
the
conflict
that
new
york
was
waging
for
the
control
of
the
western
the
five
nations
as
we
have
seen
acted
as
middlemen
between
the
new
york
merchants
and
the
tribes
of
the
far
interior
and
through
them
english
goods
and
english
influence
penetrated
all
the
lake
country
and
reached
even
to
the
mississippi
these
vast
western
regions
now
swarming
with
laborious
millions
were
then
scantily
peopled
by
savage
hordes
whose
increase
was
stopped
by
incessant
mutual
slaughter
this
wild
population
had
various
centres
or
usually
about
the
french
forts
which
protected
them
from
enemies
and
supplied
their
wants
thus
the
pottawattamies
ottawas
and
hurons
were
gathered
about
detroit
and
the
illinois
about
fort
louis
on
the
river
illinois
where
henri
de
tonty
and
his
old
comrade
la
forest
with
fifteen
or
twenty
frenchmen
held
a
nominal
monopoly
of
the
neighboring
another
focus
of
indian
population
was
near
the
green
bay
of
lake
michigan
and
on
fox
river
which
enters
it
here
were
grouped
the
sacs
winnebagoes
and
menominies
with
the
outagamies
or
foxes
a
formidable
tribe
the
source
of
endless
trouble
to
the
french
the
constant
aim
of
the
canadian
authorities
was
to
keep
these
western
savages
at
peace
among
themselves
while
preventing
their
establishing
relations
of
trade
with
the
five
nations
and
carrying
their
furs
to
them
in
exchange
for
english
goods
the
position
was
delicate
for
while
a
close
understanding
between
the
western
tribes
and
the
five
nations
would
be
injurious
to
french
interests
a
quarrel
would
be
still
more
so
since
the
french
would
then
be
forced
to
side
with
their
western
allies
and
so
be
drawn
into
hostilities
with
the
iroquois
confederacy
which
of
all
things
they
most
wished
to
avoid
peace
and
friendship
among
the
western
tribes
peace
without
friendship
between
these
tribes
and
the
five
nations
thus
became
maxims
of
french
policy
the
canadian
governor
called
the
western
indians
his
children
and
a
family
quarrel
among
them
would
have
been
unfortunate
since
the
loving
father
must
needs
have
become
involved
in
it
to
the
detriment
of
his
trading
interests
yet
to
prevent
such
quarrels
was
difficult
partly
because
they
had
existed
time
out
of
mind
and
partly
because
it
was
the
interest
of
the
english
to
promote
them
dutch
and
english
traders
it
is
true
took
their
lives
in
their
hands
if
they
ventured
among
the
western
indians
who
were
encouraged
by
their
french
father
to
plunder
and
kill
them
and
who
on
occasion
rarely
hesitated
to
do
so
hence
english
communication
with
the
west
was
largely
carried
on
through
the
five
nations
iroquois
messengers
hired
for
the
purpose
carried
wampum
belts
underground
that
is
secretly
to
such
of
the
interior
tribes
as
were
disposed
to
listen
with
favor
to
the
words
of
corlaer
as
they
called
the
governor
of
new
york
in
spite
of
their
shortcomings
the
english
had
one
powerful
attraction
for
all
the
tribes
alike
this
was
the
abundance
and
excellence
of
their
goods
which
with
the
exception
of
gunpowder
were
better
as
well
as
cheaper
than
those
offered
by
the
french
the
indians
it
is
true
liked
the
taste
of
french
brandy
more
than
that
of
english
rum
yet
as
their
chief
object
in
drinking
was
to
get
drunk
and
as
rum
would
supply
as
much
intoxication
as
brandy
at
a
lower
price
it
always
found
favor
in
their
eyes
in
the
one
case
to
get
thoroughly
drunk
often
cost
a
in
the
other
the
same
satisfaction
could
generally
be
had
for
a
thus
the
french
found
that
some
of
their
western
children
were
disposed
to
listen
to
english
seductions
look
askance
at
their
father
onontio
and
turn
their
canoes
not
towards
montreal
but
towards
albany
nor
was
this
the
worst
for
there
were
some
of
onontio
wild
and
unruly
western
family
too
ready
to
lift
their
hatchets
against
their
brethren
and
fill
the
wilderness
with
discord
consequences
followed
most
embarrassing
to
the
french
and
among
them
an
incident
prominent
in
the
early
annals
of
detroit
that
new
establishment
so
obnoxious
to
the
english
because
it
barred
their
way
to
the
northern
lakes
so
that
they
were
extremely
anxious
to
rid
themselves
of
it
in
the
confused
and
tumultuous
history
of
the
savages
of
this
continent
one
now
and
then
sees
some
tribe
or
league
of
tribes
possessed
for
a
time
with
a
spirit
of
conquest
and
havoc
that
made
it
the
terror
of
its
neighbors
of
this
the
foremost
example
is
that
of
the
five
nations
of
the
iroquois
who
towards
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
swept
all
before
them
and
made
vast
regions
a
solitude
they
were
now
comparatively
quiet
but
far
in
the
northwest
another
people
inferior
in
number
organization
and
mental
capacity
but
not
in
ferocity
or
courage
had
begun
on
a
smaller
scale
and
with
less
conspicuous
success
to
play
a
similar
part
these
were
the
outagamies
or
foxes
with
their
allies
the
kickapoos
and
the
mascoutins
all
living
at
the
time
within
the
limits
of
the
present
states
of
wisconsin
and
illinois
the
outagamies
near
fox
river
and
the
others
on
rock
river
the
outagamies
in
particular
seem
to
have
been
seized
with
an
access
of
homicidal
fury
their
hand
was
against
every
man
and
for
twenty
years
and
more
they
were
the
firebrands
of
the
west
and
a
ceaseless
peril
to
french
interests
in
that
region
they
were
however
on
good
terms
with
the
five
nations
by
means
of
whom
as
french
writers
say
the
dutch
and
english
of
albany
sent
them
gifts
and
messages
to
incite
them
to
kill
french
traders
and
destroy
the
french
fort
at
detroit
this
is
not
unlikely
though
the
evidence
on
the
point
is
far
from
conclusive
fort
ponchartrain
better
known
as
fort
detroit
was
an
enclosure
of
palisades
flanked
by
blockhouses
at
the
corners
with
an
open
space
within
to
serve
as
a
around
which
stood
small
wooden
houses
thatched
with
straw
or
la
founder
of
the
post
had
been
made
governor
of
the
new
colony
of
louisiana
and
the
sieur
dubuisson
now
commanded
at
detroit
there
were
about
thirty
french
traders
and
de
in
the
place
but
at
this
time
no
soldiers
the
village
of
the
pottawattamies
was
close
to
the
french
fort
that
of
the
hurons
was
not
far
distant
by
the
edge
of
the
river
their
houses
were
those
structures
of
bark
very
high
very
long
and
arched
like
garden
arbors
which
were
common
to
all
the
tribes
of
iroquois
stock
and
both
villages
were
enclosed
by
strong
double
or
triple
stockades
such
as
cartier
had
found
at
hochelaga
and
champlain
in
the
onondaga
country
their
neighbors
the
ottawas
who
were
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
had
imitated
with
imperfect
success
their
way
of
housing
and
fortifying
themselves
these
tribes
raised
considerable
crops
of
peas
beans
and
indian
corn
and
except
when
engaged
in
their
endless
dances
and
games
of
ball
dressed
like
the
converts
of
the
mission
villages
in
red
or
blue
cloth
the
hurons
were
reputed
the
most
intelligent
as
well
as
the
bravest
of
all
the
western
tribes
and
being
incensed
by
various
outrages
they
bore
against
the
outagamies
a
deadly
grudge
which
was
shared
by
the
other
tribes
their
neighbors
all
these
friendly
indians
were
still
absent
on
their
winter
hunt
when
at
the
opening
of
spring
dubuisson
and
his
frenchmen
were
startled
by
a
portentous
visitation
two
bands
of
outagamies
and
mascoutins
men
women
and
children
counting
in
all
above
a
thousand
of
whom
about
three
hundred
were
warriors
appeared
on
the
meadows
behind
the
fort
approached
to
within
of
the
palisades
and
encamped
there
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
they
came
with
deliberate
hostile
intent
had
this
been
the
case
they
would
not
have
brought
their
women
and
children
a
paper
ascribed
to
the
engineer
léry
says
moreover
that
their
visit
was
in
consequence
of
an
invitation
from
the
late
commandant
la
whose
interest
it
was
to
attract
to
detroit
as
many
indians
as
possible
in
order
to
trade
for
their
furs
dubuisson
however
was
satisfied
that
they
meant
mischief
especially
when
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
prevent
them
they
fortified
themselves
by
cutting
down
young
trees
and
surrounding
their
wigwams
with
a
rough
fence
of
palisades
they
were
rude
and
insolent
declared
that
all
that
country
was
theirs
and
killed
fowls
and
pigeons
belonging
to
the
french
who
in
the
absence
of
their
friends
the
hurons
and
ottawas
dared
not
even
remonstrate
dubuisson
himself
was
forced
to
submit
to
their
insults
in
silence
till
a
party
of
them
came
one
day
into
the
fort
bent
on
killing
two
of
the
french
a
man
and
a
girl
against
whom
they
had
taken
some
offence
the
commandant
then
ordered
his
men
to
drive
them
out
which
was
done
and
henceforward
he
was
convinced
that
the
outagamies
and
mascoutins
were
only
watching
their
opportunity
to
burn
the
fort
and
butcher
its
inmates
soon
after
their
excitement
redoubled
news
came
that
a
band
of
mascoutins
who
had
wintered
on
the
river
joseph
had
been
cut
off
by
the
ottawas
and
pottawattamies
led
by
an
ottawa
chief
named
saguina
on
which
the
behavior
of
the
dangerous
visitors
became
so
threatening
that
dubuisson
hastily
sent
a
canoe
to
recall
the
hurons
and
ottawas
from
their
and
a
second
to
invite
the
friendly
ojibwas
and
mississagas
to
come
to
his
aid
no
doubt
there
was
good
cause
for
alarm
yet
if
the
dangerous
strangers
had
resolved
to
strike
they
would
have
been
apt
to
strike
at
once
instead
of
waiting
week
after
week
when
they
knew
that
the
friends
and
allies
of
the
french
might
arrive
at
any
time
dubuisson
however
felt
that
the
situation
was
extremely
critical
and
he
was
confirmed
in
his
anxiety
by
a
friendly
outagamie
who
after
the
news
of
the
massacre
on
the
joseph
told
him
that
his
tribesmen
meant
to
burn
the
fort
the
church
was
outside
the
palisade
as
were
also
several
houses
one
of
which
was
stored
with
wheat
this
the
outagamies
tried
to
seize
the
french
fired
on
them
drove
them
back
and
brought
most
of
the
wheat
into
the
fort
then
they
demolished
the
church
and
several
of
the
houses
which
would
have
given
cover
to
the
assailants
and
enabled
them
to
set
fire
to
the
palisade
close
to
which
the
buildings
stood
the
french
worked
at
their
task
in
the
excitement
of
desperation
for
they
thought
that
all
was
lost
the
irritation
of
their
savage
neighbors
so
increased
that
an
outbreak
seemed
imminent
when
on
the
thirteenth
of
may
the
sieur
de
vincennes
arrived
with
seven
or
eight
frenchmen
from
the
miami
country
the
reinforcement
was
so
small
that
instead
of
proving
a
help
it
might
have
provoked
a
crisis
vincennes
brought
no
news
of
the
indian
allies
who
were
now
dubuisson
only
hope
i
did
not
know
on
what
saint
to
call
he
writes
almost
in
despair
when
suddenly
a
huron
indian
came
panting
into
the
fort
with
the
joyful
news
that
both
his
people
and
the
ottawas
were
close
at
hand
nor
was
this
all
the
huron
messenger
announced
that
makisabie
of
the
pottawattamies
was
then
at
the
huron
fort
and
that
six
hundred
warriors
of
various
tribes
deadly
enemies
of
the
outagamies
and
mascoutins
would
soon
arrive
and
destroy
them
all
here
was
an
deliverance
yet
the
danger
was
not
over
for
there
was
fear
lest
the
outagamies
and
their
allies
hearing
of
the
approaching
succor
might
make
a
desperate
onslaught
burn
the
french
fort
and
kill
its
inmates
before
their
friends
could
reach
them
an
interval
of
suspense
followed
relieved
at
last
by
a
french
sentinel
who
called
to
dubuisson
that
a
crowd
of
indians
was
in
sight
the
commandant
mounted
to
the
top
of
a
blockhouse
and
looking
across
the
meadows
behind
the
fort
saw
a
throng
of
savages
coming
out
of
the
woods
pottawattamies
sacs
menominies
illinois
missouris
and
other
tribes
yet
more
remote
each
band
distinguished
by
a
kind
of
ensign
these
were
the
six
hundred
warriors
promised
by
the
huron
messenger
and
with
them
as
it
proved
came
the
ottawa
saguina
having
heard
during
the
winter
that
the
outagamies
and
mascoutins
would
go
to
detroit
in
the
spring
these
various
tribes
had
combined
to
attack
the
common
enemy
and
they
now
marched
with
great
ostentation
and
some
show
of
order
not
to
the
french
fort
but
to
the
fortified
village
of
the
hurons
who
with
their
neighbors
the
ottawas
had
arrived
just
before
them
the
hurons
were
reputed
leaders
among
the
western
tribes
and
they
hated
the
outagamies
not
only
by
reason
of
bitter
wrongs
but
also
through
jealousy
of
the
growing
importance
which
these
fierce
upstarts
had
won
by
their
sanguinary
prowess
the
huron
chiefs
came
to
meet
the
motley
crew
of
warriors
and
urged
them
to
instant
action
you
must
not
stop
to
encamp
said
the
huron
spokesman
we
must
all
go
this
moment
to
the
fort
of
our
fathers
the
french
and
fight
for
them
then
turning
to
the
ottawa
do
you
see
that
smoke
saguina
rising
from
the
camp
of
our
enemies
they
are
burning
three
women
of
your
village
and
your
wife
is
one
of
them
the
outagamies
had
in
fact
three
ottawa
squaws
in
their
clutches
but
the
burning
was
an
invention
of
the
crafty
huron
it
answered
its
purpose
and
wrought
the
hearers
to
fury
they
ran
with
yells
and
whoops
towards
the
french
fort
the
hurons
and
ottawas
leading
the
way
a
burst
of
answering
yells
rose
from
the
camp
of
the
enemy
and
about
forty
of
their
warriors
ran
out
in
bravado
stripped
naked
and
brandishing
their
weapons
but
they
soon
fell
back
within
their
defences
before
the
approaching
multitude
just
before
the
arrival
of
the
six
hundred
allies
dubuisson
whose
orders
were
to
keep
the
peace
if
he
could
among
the
western
tribes
had
sent
vincennes
to
the
huron
village
with
a
proposal
that
they
should
spare
the
lives
of
the
outagamies
and
mascoutins
and
rest
content
with
driving
them
away
to
which
the
hurons
returned
a
fierce
and
haughty
refusal
there
was
danger
that
if
vexed
or
thwarted
the
rabble
of
excited
savages
now
gathered
before
the
fort
might
turn
from
friends
into
enemies
and
in
some
burst
of
wild
caprice
lift
parricidal
tomahawks
against
their
french
fathers
dubuisson
saw
no
choice
but
to
humor
them
put
himself
at
their
head
aid
them
in
their
vengeance
and
even
set
them
on
therefore
when
they
called
out
for
admittance
he
did
not
venture
to
refuse
it
but
threw
open
the
gate
the
savage
crew
poured
in
till
the
fort
was
full
the
chiefs
gathered
for
council
on
the
parade
and
the
warriors
crowded
around
a
living
wall
of
dusky
forms
befeathered
heads
savage
faces
lank
snaky
locks
and
eyes
that
glittered
with
a
devilish
light
their
orator
spoke
briefly
but
to
the
purpose
he
declared
that
all
present
were
ready
to
die
for
their
french
father
who
had
stood
their
friend
against
the
bloody
and
perfidious
outagamies
then
he
begged
for
food
tobacco
gunpowder
and
bullets
dubuisson
replied
with
equal
conciseness
thanked
them
for
their
willingness
to
die
for
him
said
that
he
would
do
his
best
to
supply
their
wants
and
promised
an
immediate
distribution
of
powder
and
bullets
to
which
the
whole
assembly
answered
with
yells
of
joy
then
the
council
dissolved
and
the
elder
warriors
stalked
about
the
fort
haranguing
their
followers
exhorting
them
to
fight
like
men
and
obey
the
orders
of
their
father
the
powder
and
bullets
were
served
out
after
which
the
whole
body
white
men
and
red
yelled
the
together
a
horrible
cry
that
made
the
earth
tremble
writes
dubuisson
an
answering
howl
furious
and
defiant
rose
close
at
hand
from
the
palisaded
camp
of
the
enemy
the
firing
began
on
both
sides
and
bullets
and
arrows
filled
the
air
the
french
and
their
allies
outnumbered
their
enemies
fourfold
while
the
outagamie
and
mascoutin
warriors
were
encumbered
with
more
than
seven
hundred
women
and
children
their
frail
defences
might
have
been
carried
by
assault
but
the
loss
to
the
assailants
must
needs
have
been
great
against
so
brave
and
desperate
a
foe
and
such
a
mode
of
attack
is
repugnant
to
the
indian
genius
instead
therefore
of
storming
the
palisaded
camp
the
allies
beleaguered
it
with
vindictive
patience
and
wore
out
its
defenders
by
a
fire
that
ceased
neither
day
nor
night
the
french
raised
two
tall
scaffolds
from
which
they
overlooked
the
palisade
and
sent
their
shot
into
the
midst
of
those
within
who
were
forced
for
shelter
to
dig
holes
in
the
ground
four
or
five
feet
deep
and
ensconce
themselves
there
the
situation
was
almost
hopeless
but
their
courage
did
not
fail
they
raised
twelve
red
english
blankets
on
poles
as
to
show
that
they
would
fight
to
the
death
and
hung
others
over
their
palisades
calling
out
that
they
wished
to
see
the
whole
earth
red
like
them
with
blood
that
they
had
no
fathers
but
the
english
and
that
the
other
tribes
had
better
do
as
they
did
and
turn
their
backs
to
onontio
the
great
of
the
pottawattamies
now
mounted
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
french
scaffolds
and
harangued
the
enemy
to
this
effect
do
you
think
you
wretches
that
you
can
frighten
us
by
hanging
out
those
red
blankets
if
the
earth
is
red
with
blood
it
will
be
your
own
you
talk
about
the
english
their
bad
advice
will
be
your
ruin
they
are
enemies
of
religion
and
that
is
why
the
master
of
life
punishes
both
them
and
you
they
are
cowards
and
can
only
defend
themselves
by
poisoning
people
with
their
firewater
which
kills
a
man
the
instant
he
drinks
it
we
shall
soon
see
what
you
will
get
for
listening
to
them
this
homeric
dialogue
between
the
chief
combatants
was
stopped
by
dubuisson
who
saw
that
it
distracted
the
attention
of
the
warriors
and
so
enabled
the
besieged
to
run
to
the
adjacent
river
for
water
the
firing
was
resumed
more
fiercely
than
ever
before
night
twelve
of
the
indian
allies
were
killed
in
the
french
fort
though
the
enemy
suffered
a
much
greater
loss
one
house
had
been
left
standing
outside
the
french
palisades
and
the
outagamies
raised
a
scaffold
behind
its
gable
under
cover
of
which
they
fired
with
great
effect
the
french
at
length
brought
two
swivels
to
bear
upon
the
gable
pierced
it
knocked
down
the
scaffold
killed
some
of
the
marksmen
and
scattered
the
rest
in
consternation
famine
and
thirst
were
worse
for
the
besieged
than
the
bullets
and
arrows
of
the
allies
parched
starved
and
fainting
they
could
no
longer
find
heart
for
bravado
and
they
called
out
one
evening
from
behind
their
defences
to
ask
dubuisson
if
they
might
come
to
speak
with
him
he
called
together
the
allied
chiefs
and
all
agreed
that
here
was
an
opportunity
to
get
out
of
the
hands
of
the
outagamies
the
three
ottawa
women
whom
they
held
prisoners
the
commandant
therefore
told
them
that
if
they
had
anything
to
say
to
their
father
before
dying
they
might
come
and
say
it
in
safety
in
the
morning
all
the
red
blankets
had
disappeared
and
a
white
flag
was
waving
over
the
hostile
camp
the
great
outagamie
chief
pemoussa
presently
came
out
carrying
a
smaller
white
flag
and
followed
by
two
indian
slaves
dubuisson
sent
his
interpreter
to
protect
him
from
insult
and
conduct
him
to
the
parade
where
all
the
allied
chiefs
presently
met
to
hear
him
my
father
he
began
i
am
a
dead
man
the
sky
is
bright
for
you
and
dark
as
night
for
me
then
he
held
out
a
belt
of
wampum
and
continued
by
this
belt
i
ask
you
my
father
to
take
pity
on
your
children
and
grant
us
two
days
in
which
our
old
men
may
counsel
together
to
find
means
of
appeasing
your
wrath
then
offering
another
belt
to
the
assembled
chiefs
this
belt
is
to
pray
you
to
remember
that
you
are
of
our
kin
if
you
spill
our
blood
do
not
forget
that
it
is
also
your
own
try
to
soften
the
heart
of
our
father
whom
we
have
offended
so
often
these
two
slaves
are
to
replace
some
of
the
blood
you
have
lost
grant
us
the
two
days
we
ask
for
i
can
not
say
more
till
our
old
men
have
held
counsel
to
which
dubuisson
answered
in
the
name
of
all
if
your
hearts
were
really
changed
and
you
honestly
accepted
onontio
as
your
father
you
would
have
brought
back
the
three
women
who
are
prisoners
in
your
hands
as
you
have
not
done
so
i
think
that
your
hearts
are
still
bad
first
bring
them
to
me
if
you
expect
me
to
hear
you
i
have
no
more
to
say
i
am
but
a
child
replied
the
envoy
i
will
go
back
to
my
village
and
tell
our
old
men
what
you
have
said
the
council
then
broke
up
and
several
frenchmen
conducted
the
chief
back
to
his
followers
three
other
chiefs
soon
after
appeared
bearing
a
flag
and
bringing
the
ottawa
squaws
one
of
whom
was
the
wife
of
the
saguina
again
the
elders
met
in
council
on
the
parade
and
the
orator
of
the
deputation
spoke
thus
my
father
here
are
the
three
pieces
of
flesh
that
you
ask
of
us
we
would
not
eat
them
lest
you
should
be
angry
do
with
them
what
you
please
for
you
are
the
master
now
we
ask
that
you
will
send
away
the
nations
that
are
with
you
so
that
we
may
seek
food
for
our
women
and
children
who
die
of
hunger
every
day
if
you
are
as
good
a
father
as
your
other
children
say
you
are
you
will
not
refuse
us
this
favor
but
dubuisson
having
gained
his
point
and
recovered
the
squaws
spoke
to
them
sternly
and
referred
them
to
his
indian
allies
for
their
answer
whereupon
the
head
chief
of
the
illinois
being
called
upon
by
the
rest
to
speak
in
their
behalf
addressed
the
envoys
to
this
effect
listen
to
me
you
who
have
troubled
all
the
earth
we
see
plainly
that
you
mean
only
to
deceive
our
father
if
we
should
leave
him
as
you
wish
you
would
fall
upon
him
and
kill
him
you
are
dogs
who
have
always
bitten
him
you
thought
that
we
did
not
know
all
the
messages
you
have
had
from
the
english
telling
you
to
cut
our
father
throat
and
then
bring
them
into
this
our
country
we
will
not
leave
him
alone
with
you
we
shall
see
who
will
be
the
master
go
back
to
your
fort
we
are
going
to
fire
at
you
again
the
envoys
went
back
with
a
french
escort
to
prevent
their
being
murdered
on
the
way
and
then
the
firing
began
again
the
outagamies
and
mascoutins
gathered
strength
from
desperation
and
sent
flights
of
into
the
fort
to
burn
the
houses
the
flames
caught
in
many
places
but
with
the
help
of
the
indians
they
were
extinguished
though
several
frenchmen
were
wounded
and
there
was
great
fright
for
a
time
but
the
thatch
was
soon
stripped
off
and
the
roofs
covered
with
deer
and
bear
skins
while
mops
fastened
to
long
poles
and
two
large
wooden
canoes
filled
with
water
were
made
ready
for
future
need
a
few
days
after
a
greater
peril
threatened
the
french
if
the
wild
indian
has
the
passions
of
a
devil
he
has
also
the
instability
of
a
child
and
this
is
especially
true
when
a
number
of
incoherent
tribes
or
bands
are
joined
in
a
common
enterprise
dubuisson
indians
became
discouraged
partly
at
the
stubborn
resistance
of
the
enemy
and
partly
at
the
scarcity
of
food
some
of
them
declared
openly
that
they
could
never
conquer
those
people
that
they
knew
them
well
and
that
they
were
braver
than
anybody
else
in
short
the
french
saw
themselves
on
the
point
of
being
abandoned
by
their
allies
to
a
fate
the
most
ghastly
and
appalling
and
they
urged
upon
the
commandant
the
necessity
of
escaping
to
michilimackinac
before
it
was
too
late
dubuisson
appears
to
have
met
the
crisis
with
equal
resolution
and
address
he
braced
the
shaken
nerves
of
his
white
followers
by
appeals
to
their
sense
of
shame
threats
of
the
governor
wrath
and
assurances
that
all
would
yet
be
well
then
set
himself
to
the
more
difficult
task
of
holding
the
indian
allies
to
their
work
he
says
that
he
scarcely
ate
or
slept
for
four
days
and
nights
during
which
time
he
was
busied
without
ceasing
in
private
and
separate
interviews
with
all
the
young
persuading
them
flattering
them
and
stripping
himself
of
all
he
had
to
make
them
presents
when
at
last
he
had
gained
them
over
he
called
the
tribes
to
a
general
council
what
children
thus
he
addressed
them
when
you
are
on
the
very
point
of
destroying
these
wicked
people
do
you
think
of
shamefully
running
away
how
could
you
ever
hold
up
your
heads
again
all
the
other
nations
would
say
these
the
brave
warriors
who
deserted
the
french
and
ran
like
cowards
and
he
reminded
them
that
their
enemies
were
already
half
dead
with
famine
and
that
they
could
easily
make
an
end
of
them
thereby
gaining
great
honor
among
the
nations
besides
the
thanks
and
favors
of
onontio
the
father
of
all
at
this
the
young
whom
he
had
gained
over
interrupted
him
and
cried
out
my
father
somebody
has
been
lying
to
you
we
are
not
cowards
we
love
you
too
much
to
abandon
you
and
we
will
stand
by
you
till
the
last
of
your
enemies
is
dead
the
elder
men
caught
the
contagion
and
cried
come
on
let
us
show
our
father
that
those
who
have
spoken
ill
of
us
are
liars
then
they
all
raised
the
sang
the
danced
the
and
began
to
fire
again
among
the
enemy
were
some
sakis
or
sacs
fighting
for
the
outagamies
while
others
of
their
tribe
were
among
the
allies
of
the
french
seeing
the
desperate
turn
of
affairs
they
escaped
from
time
to
time
and
came
over
to
the
winning
side
bringing
reports
of
the
state
of
the
beleaguered
camp
they
declared
that
sixty
or
eighty
women
and
children
were
already
dead
from
hunger
and
thirst
besides
those
killed
by
bullets
and
arrows
that
the
fire
of
the
besiegers
was
so
hot
that
the
bodies
could
not
be
buried
and
that
the
camp
of
the
outagamies
and
mascoutins
was
a
den
of
infection
the
end
was
near
the
besieged
savages
called
from
their
palisades
to
ask
if
they
might
send
another
deputation
and
were
told
that
they
were
free
to
do
so
the
chief
pemoussa
soon
appeared
at
the
gate
of
the
fort
naked
painted
from
head
to
foot
with
green
earth
wearing
belts
of
wampum
about
his
waist
and
others
hanging
from
his
shoulders
besides
a
kind
of
crown
of
wampum
beads
on
his
head
with
him
came
seven
women
meant
as
a
all
painted
and
adorned
with
wampum
three
other
principal
chiefs
followed
each
with
a
gourd
rattle
in
his
hand
to
the
cadence
of
which
the
whole
party
sang
and
shouted
at
the
full
stretch
of
their
lungs
an
invocation
to
the
spirits
for
help
and
pity
they
were
conducted
to
the
parade
where
the
french
and
the
allied
chiefs
were
already
assembled
and
pemoussa
thus
addressed
them
my
father
and
all
the
nations
here
present
i
come
to
ask
for
life
it
is
no
longer
ours
but
yours
i
bring
you
these
seven
women
who
are
my
flesh
and
whom
i
put
at
your
feet
to
be
your
slaves
but
do
not
think
that
i
am
afraid
to
die
it
is
the
life
of
our
women
and
children
that
i
ask
of
you
he
then
offered
six
wampum
belts
in
token
that
his
followers
owned
themselves
beaten
and
begged
for
mercy
tell
us
i
pray
you
these
were
his
last
words
something
that
will
lighten
the
hearts
of
my
people
when
i
go
back
to
them
dubuisson
left
the
answer
to
his
allies
the
appeal
of
the
suppliant
fell
on
hearts
of
stone
the
whole
concourse
sat
in
fierce
and
sullen
silence
and
the
envoys
read
their
doom
in
the
gloomy
brows
that
surrounded
them
eight
or
ten
of
the
allied
savages
presently
came
to
dubuisson
and
one
of
them
said
in
a
low
voice
my
father
we
come
to
ask
your
leave
to
knock
these
four
great
chiefs
in
the
head
it
is
they
who
prevent
our
enemies
from
surrendering
without
conditions
when
they
are
dead
the
rest
will
be
at
our
mercy
dubuisson
told
them
that
they
must
be
drunk
to
propose
such
a
thing
remember
he
said
that
both
you
and
i
have
given
our
word
for
their
safety
if
i
consented
to
what
you
ask
your
father
at
montreal
would
never
forgive
me
besides
you
can
see
plainly
that
they
and
their
people
can
not
escape
you
the
murderers
consented
to
bide
their
time
and
the
wretched
envoys
went
back
with
their
tidings
of
despair
i
confess
wrote
dubuisson
to
the
governor
a
few
days
later
that
i
was
touched
with
compassion
but
as
war
and
pity
do
not
agree
well
together
and
especially
as
i
understood
that
they
were
hired
by
the
english
to
destroy
us
i
abandoned
them
to
their
fate
the
firing
began
once
more
and
the
allied
hordes
howled
round
the
camp
of
their
victims
like
troops
of
ravenous
wolves
but
a
surprise
awaited
them
indians
rarely
set
guards
at
night
and
they
felt
sure
now
of
their
prey
it
was
the
nineteenth
day
of
the
siege
the
night
closed
dark
and
rainy
and
when
morning
came
the
enemy
were
gone
all
among
them
that
had
strength
to
move
had
glided
away
through
the
gloom
with
the
silence
of
shadows
passed
the
camps
of
their
sleeping
enemies
and
reached
a
point
of
land
projecting
into
the
river
opposite
the
end
of
isle
au
cochon
and
a
few
miles
above
the
french
fort
here
knowing
that
they
would
be
pursued
they
barricaded
themselves
with
trunks
and
branches
of
trees
when
the
astonished
allies
discovered
their
escape
they
hastily
followed
their
trail
accompanied
by
some
of
the
french
led
by
vincennes
in
their
eagerness
they
ran
upon
the
barricade
before
seeing
it
and
were
met
by
a
fire
that
killed
and
wounded
twenty
of
them
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
forego
their
revenge
and
abandon
the
field
or
begin
another
siege
encouraged
by
dubuisson
they
built
their
wigwams
on
the
new
scene
of
operations
and
being
supplied
by
the
french
with
axes
mattocks
and
two
swivels
they
made
a
wall
of
logs
opposite
the
barricade
from
which
they
galled
the
defenders
with
a
close
and
deadly
fire
the
mississagas
and
ojibwas
who
had
lately
arrived
fished
and
hunted
for
the
allies
while
the
french
furnished
them
with
powder
ball
tobacco
indian
corn
and
kettles
the
enemy
fought
desperately
for
four
days
and
then
in
utter
exhaustion
surrendered
at
discretion
the
women
and
children
were
divided
among
the
victorious
hordes
and
adopted
or
enslaved
to
the
men
no
quarter
was
given
our
indians
amused
themselves
writes
dubuisson
with
shooting
four
or
five
of
them
every
day
here
however
another
surprise
awaited
the
conquerors
and
abridged
their
recreation
for
about
a
hundred
of
these
intrepid
warriors
contrived
to
make
their
escape
and
among
them
was
the
great
pemoussa
the
outagamies
were
crippled
but
not
disabled
for
but
a
part
of
the
tribe
was
involved
in
this
bloody
affair
the
rest
were
wrought
to
fury
by
the
fate
of
their
kinsmen
and
for
many
years
they
remained
thorns
in
the
sides
of
the
french
there
is
a
disposition
to
assume
that
events
like
that
just
recounted
were
a
consequence
of
the
contact
of
white
men
with
red
but
the
primitive
indian
was
quite
able
to
enact
such
tragedies
without
the
help
of
europeans
before
french
or
english
influence
had
been
felt
in
the
interior
of
the
continent
a
great
part
of
north
america
was
the
frequent
witness
of
scenes
still
more
lurid
in
coloring
and
on
a
larger
scale
of
horror
in
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
whole
country
from
lake
superior
to
the
tennessee
and
from
the
alleghanies
to
the
mississippi
was
ravaged
by
wars
of
extermination
in
which
tribes
large
and
powerful
by
indian
standards
perished
dwindled
into
feeble
remnants
or
were
absorbed
by
other
tribes
and
vanished
from
sight
french
pioneers
were
sometimes
involved
in
the
carnage
but
neither
they
nor
other
europeans
were
answerable
for
it

an
event
took
place
that
was
to
have
a
great
influence
on
the
future
of
french
america
this
was
the
occupation
by
france
of
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
the
vindication
of
her
claim
to
the
vast
and
undefined
regions
which
la

had
called

la

schemes
had
come
to
nought
but
they
were
revived
seven
years
after
his
death
by
his
lieutenant
the
gallant
and
faithful
henri
de
tonty
who
urged
the
seizure
of
louisiana
for
three
reasons
first
as
a
base
of
attack
upon
mexico
secondly
as
a
dépôt
for
the

as

from

three
years

the
sieur
de

a
friend
of

proposed
the
formation
of
a
company
for
the
settlement
of
louisiana
and
called
for
immediate
action
as
indispensable
to
anticipate
the
english
the
english
were
in
fact
on
the
point
of
taking
possession
of
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
were
prevented
only
by
the
prompt
intervention
of
the
rival
nation

they
had
succeeded
colonies

have
grown
up
on

after
the
type
of

along
the
atlantic
voluntary
immigrants
would
have
brought
to
a
new
home
their
old
inheritance
of
english
freedom
would
have
ruled
themselves
by
laws
of
their
own
making
through
magistrates
of
their
own
choice
would
have
depended
on
their
own
efforts
and
not
on
government
help
in
the
invigorating
consciousness
that
their
destinies
were
in
their
own
hands
and
that
they
themselves
and
not
others
were
to
gather
the
fruits
of
their
toils
out
of
conditions
like
these
would
have
sprung
communities
not
brilliant
but
healthy
orderly
well
rooted
in
the
soil
and
of
hardy
and
vigorous
growth
but
the
principles
of
absolutism
and
not
those
of
a
regulated
liberty
were
to
rule
in
louisiana
the
new
french
colony
was
to
be
the
child
of
the
crown
cargoes
of
emigrants
willing
or
unwilling
were
to
be
shipped
by
authority
to
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
cargoes
made
up
in
part
of
those
whom
fortune
and
their
own
defects
had
sunk
to
dependence
to
whom
labor
was
strange
and
odious
but
who
dreamed
of
gold
mines
and
pearl
fisheries
and
wealth
to
be
won
in
the
new
world
and
spent
in
the
old
who
wore
the
shackles
of
a
paternal
despotism
which
they
were
told
to
regard
as
of
divine
institution
who
were
at
the
mercy
of
military
rulers
set
over
them
by
the
king
and
agreeing
in
nothing
except
in
enforcing
the
mandates
of
arbitrary
power
and
the
withering
maxim
that
the
labor
of
the
colonist
was
due
not
to
himself
but
to
his
masters
it
remains
to
trace
briefly
the
results
of
such
conditions
the
scheme
of
rémonville
for
settling
the
mississippi
country
had
no
result
in
the
next
year
the
gallant
le
moyne
who
has
been
called
the
cid
or
more
fitly
the
jean
bart
of
canada
offered
to
carry
out
the
schemes
of
la
salle
and
plant
a
colony
in
louisiana
one
thing
had
become
clear
france
must
act
at
once
or
lose
the
mississippi
already
there
was
a
movement
in
london
to
seize
upon
it
under
a
grant
to
two
noblemen
iberville
offer
was
accepted
he
was
ordered
to
build
a
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
great
river
and
leave
a
garrison
to
hold
it
he
sailed
with
two
frigates
the
badine
and
the
marin
and
towards
the
end
of
january
reached
pensacola
here
he
found
two
spanish
ships
which
would
not
let
him
enter
the
harbor
spain
no
less
than
england
was
bent
on
making
good
her
claim
to
the
mississippi
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
two
ships
had
come
from
vera
cruz
on
this
errand
three
hundred
men
had
been
landed
and
a
stockade
fort
was
already
built
iberville
left
the
spaniards
undisturbed
and
unchallenged
and
felt
his
way
westward
along
the
coasts
of
alabama
and
mississippi
exploring
and
sounding
as
he
went
at
the
beginning
of
march
his
boats
were
caught
in
a
strong
muddy
current
of
fresh
water
and
he
saw
that
he
had
reached
the
object
of
his
search
the
fatal
river
of
the
unfortunate
la
salle
he
entered
it
encamped
on
the
night
of
the
third
twelve
leagues
above
its
mouth
climbed
a
solitary
tree
and
could
see
nothing
but
broad
flats
of
bushes
and
canebrakes
still
pushing
upward
against
the
current
he
reached
in
eleven
days
a
village
of
the
bayagoula
indians
where
he
found
the
chief
attired
in
a
blue
capote
which
was
probably
put
on
in
honor
of
the
white
strangers
and
which
as
the
wearer
declared
had
been
given
him
by
henri
de
tonty
on
his
descent
of
the
mississippi
in
search
of
la
salle
thirteen
years
before
young
le
moyne
de
bienville
who
accompanied
his
brother
iberville
in
a
canoe
brought
him
some
time
after
a
letter
from
tonty
which
the
writer
had
left
in
the
hands
of
another
chief
to
be
delivered
to
la
salle
in
case
of
his
arrival
and
which
bienville
had
bought
for
a
hatchet
iberville
welcomed
it
as
convincing
proof
that
the
river
he
had
entered
was
in
truth
the
mississippi
after
pushing
up
the
stream
till
the
he
returned
to
the
ships
by
way
of
lakes
maurepas
and
ponchartrain
iberville
now
repaired
to
the
harbor
of
biloxi
on
the
coast
of
the
present
state
of
mississippi
here
he
built
a
small
stockade
fort
where
he
left
eighty
men
under
the
sieur
de
sauvolle
to
hold
the
country
for
louis
xiv
and
this
done
he
sailed
for
france
thus
the
first
foundations
of
louisiana
were
laid
in
mississippi
bienville
whom
his
brother
had
left
at
biloxi
as
second
in
command
was
sent
by
sauvolle
on
an
exploring
expedition
up
the
mississippi
with
five
men
in
two
canoes
at
the
bend
of
the
river
now
called
english
turn
à
below
the
site
of
new
orleans
he
found
an
english
corvette
of
ten
guns
having
as
passengers
a
number
of
french
protestant
families
taken
on
board
from
the
carolinas
with
the
intention
of
settling
on
the
mississippi
the
commander
captain
louis
bank
declared
that
his
vessel
was
one
of
three
sent
from
london
by
a
company
formed
jointly
of
englishmen
and
huguenot
refugees
for
the
purpose
of
founding
a
colony
though
not
quite
sure
that
they
were
upon
the
mississippi
they
were
on
their
way
up
the
stream
to
join
a
party
of
englishmen
said
to
be
among
the
chickasaws
with
whom
they
were
trading
for
indian
slaves
bienville
assured
bank
that
he
was
not
upon
the
mississippi
but
on
another
river
belonging
to
king
louis
who
had
a
strong
fort
there
and
several
settlements
the
englishman
says
a
french
writer
believed
these
inventions
and
turned
back
first
however
a
french
engineer
in
the
service
of
bank
contrived
to
have
an
interview
with
bienville
and
gave
him
a
petition
to
the
king
of
france
signed
by
four
hundred
huguenots
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
carolinas
after
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
the
petitioners
begged
that
they
might
have
leave
to
settle
in
louisiana
with
liberty
of
conscience
under
the
french
crown
in
due
time
they
got
their
answer
the
king
replied
through
the
minister
ponchartrain
that
he
had
not
expelled
heretics
from
france
in
order
that
they
should
set
up
a
republic
in
america
thus
by
the
bigotry
that
had
been
the
bane
of
canada
and
of
france
herself
louis
xiv
threw
away
the
opportunity
of
establishing
a
firm
and
healthy
colony
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
so
threatening
was
the
danger
that
england
would
seize
the
country
that
iberville
had
scarcely
landed
in
france
when
he
was
sent
back
with
a
reinforcement
the
colonial
views
of
the
king
may
be
gathered
from
his
instructions
to
his
officer
iberville
was
told
to
seek
out
diligently
the
best
places
for
establishing
though
it
was
admitted
that
the
pearls
of
louisiana
were
uncommonly
bad
he
was
also
to
catch
bison
calves
make
a
fenced
park
to
hold
them
and
tame
them
for
the
sake
of
their
wool
which
was
reputed
to
be
of
value
for
various
fabrics
above
all
he
was
to
look
for
mines
the
finding
of
which
the
document
declares
to
be
la
grande
affaire
on
the
eighth
of
january
iberville
reached
biloxi
and
soon
after
went
up
the
mississippi
to
that
remarkable
tribe
of
the
natchez
whose
villages
were
on
and
near
the
site
of
the
city
that
now
bears
their
name
some
thirty
miles
above
he
found
a
kindred
tribe
the
taensas
whose
temple
took
fire
during
his
visit
when
to
his
horror
he
saw
five
living
infants
thrown
into
the
flames
by
their
mothers
to
appease
the
angry
spirits
retracing
his
course
he
built
a
wooden
redoubt
near
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
mississippi
to
keep
out
the
dreaded
english
in
the
next
year
he
made
a
third
voyage
and
ordered
the
feeble
establishment
at
biloxi
to
be
moved
to
the
bay
of
mobile
this
drew
a
protest
from
the
spaniards
who
rested
their
claims
to
the
country
on
the
famous
bull
of
pope
alexander
vi
the
question
was
referred
to
the
two
crowns
louis
a
stanch
champion
of
the
papacy
when
his
duties
as
a
catholic
did
not
clash
with
his
interests
as
a
king
refused
submission
to
the
bull
insisted
that
the
louisiana
country
was
his
and
declared
that
he
would
hold
fast
to
it
because
he
was
bound
as
a
son
of
holy
church
to
convert
the
indians
and
keep
out
the
english
heretics
spain
was
then
at
peace
with
france
and
her
new
king
the
duc
grandson
of
louis
needed
the
support
of
his
powerful
kinsman
hence
his
remonstrance
against
french
encroachment
was
of
the
mildest
besides
biloxi
and
mobile
bay
the
french
formed
a
third
establishment
at
dauphin
island
the
mississippi
itself
which
may
be
called
the
vital
organ
of
the
colony
was
thus
far
neglected
being
occupied
by
no
settlement
and
guarded
only
by
a
redoubt
near
one
of
its
mouths
of
the
emigrants
sent
out
by
the
court
to
the
new
land
of
promise
the
most
valuable
by
far
were
a
number
of
canadians
who
had
served
under
iberville
at
hudson
bay
the
rest
were
largely
of
the
sort
who
are
described
by
that
officer
as
beggars
sent
out
to
enrich
themselves
and
who
expected
the
government
to
feed
them
while
they
looked
for
pearls
and
gold
mines
the
paternal
providence
of
versailles
mindful
of
their
needs
sent
them
in
a
gift
of
twenty
marriageable
girls
described
as
nurtured
in
virtue
and
piety
and
accustomed
to
work
more
came
in
the
next
year
from
the
same
benignant
source
besides
soldiers
five
priests
and
two
nuns
food
however
was
not
sent
in
proportion
to
the
consumers
and
as
no
crops
were
raised
in
louisiana
famine
and
pestilence
followed
till
the
starving
colonists
were
forced
to
live
on
picked
up
along
the
shores
disorder
and
discord
filled
the
land
of
promise
nicolas
de
la
salle
the
an
official
answering
to
the
canadian
intendant
wrote
to
the
minister
ponchartrain
that
iberville
and
his
brothers
bienville
and
chateauguay
were
thieves
and
knaves
la
vente
curé
of
mobile
joined
in
the
cry
against
bienville
and
stirred
soldiers
and
settlers
to
disaffection
but
the
bitterest
accuser
of
that
truly
valuable
officer
was
the
worthy
matron
who
held
the
unenviable
post
of
directress
of
the
king
girls
that
is
the
young
women
sent
out
as
wives
for
the
colonists
it
seems
that
she
had
matrimonial
views
for
herself
as
well
as
for
her
charge
and
she
wrote
to
ponchartrain
that
major
boisbriant
commander
of
the
garrison
would
certainly
have
married
her
if
bienville
had
not
interfered
and
dissuaded
him
it
is
clear
she
adds
that
de
bienville
has
not
the
qualities
necessary
for
governing
the
colony
bienville
was
now
chief
in
authority
charges
of
peculation
and
other
offences
poured
in
against
him
and
at
last
though
nothing
was
proved
one
de
muys
was
sent
to
succeed
him
with
orders
to
send
him
home
a
prisoner
if
on
examination
the
accusations
should
prove
to
be
true
de
muys
died
on
the
voyage
the
new
intendant
proceeded
to
make
the
inquiry
but
refused
to
tell
bienville
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
saying
that
he
had
orders
not
to
do
so
nevertheless
when
he
had
finished
his
investigation
he
reported
to
the
minister
that
the
accused
was
innocent
on
which
nicolas
de
la
salle
whom
he
had
supplanted
as
intendant
wrote
to
ponchartrain
that
had
deceived
him
being
no
better
than
bienville
himself
la
salle
further
declared
that
barrot
the
surgeon
of
the
colony
was
an
ignoramus
and
that
he
made
money
by
selling
the
medicines
supplied
by
the
king
to
cure
his
louisianian
subjects
such
were
the
transatlantic
workings
of
the
paternalism
of
versailles
bienville
who
had
been
permitted
to
resume
his
authority
paints
the
state
of
the
colony
to
his
masters
and
tells
them
that
the
inhabitants
are
dying
of
hunger
not
all
however
for
he
mentions
a
few
exceptional
cases
of
prosperity
these
were
certain
thrifty
colonists
from
rochelle
who
says
bienville
have
grown
rich
by
keeping
and
now
want
to
go
back
to
france
but
he
has
set
a
watch
over
them
thinking
it
just
that
they
should
be
forced
to
stay
in
the
colony
this
was
to
add
the
bars
of
a
prison
to
the
other
attractions
of
the
new
home
as
the
colonists
would
not
work
there
was
an
attempt
to
make
indian
slaves
work
for
them
but
as
these
continually
ran
off
bienville
proposed
to
open
a
barter
with
the
french
west
indies
giving
three
red
slaves
for
two
black
ones
an
exchange
which
he
thought
would
be
mutually
advantageous
since
the
indians
being
upon
islands
could
no
longer
escape
the
court
disapproved
the
plan
on
the
ground
that
the
west
indians
would
give
only
their
worst
negroes
in
exchange
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
good
ones
was
to
fetch
them
from
guinea
complaints
against
bienville
were
renewed
till
the
court
sent
out
la
to
succeed
him
with
orders
to
examine
the
charges
against
his
predecessor
whom
it
was
his
interest
to
condemn
in
order
to
keep
the
governorship
in
his
new
post
cadillac
displayed
all
his
old
faults
began
by
denouncing
the
country
in
unmeasured
terms
and
wrote
in
his
usual
sarcastic
vein
to
the
colonial
minister
i
have
seen
the
garden
on
dauphin
island

had
been
described
to

as

about

some
of

this

their

are

then

slanders

produce
neither
grain
nor

no
longer
fancying
himself
in

draws
a
dismal
picture
of
the
state
of
the
colony
there
are
he
writes
only
ten
or
twelve
families
who
cultivate
the
soil
the
inhabitants
naturally
lazy
are
ruined
by
the
extravagance
of
their
wives
it
is
necessary
to
send
out
girls
and
i
am
convinced
that
we
shall
easily
discover
mines
when
persons
are
sent
us
who
understand
that
business
the
colonists
felt
no
confidence
in
the
future
of
louisiana
the
king
was
its
sole
support
and
if
as
was
likely
enough
he
should
tire
of
it
their
case
would
be
deplorable
when
bienville
ruled
over
them
they
had
used
him
as
their
scapegoat
but
that
which
made
the
colony
languish
was
not
he
but
the
vicious
system
it
was
his
business
to
enforce
the
royal
edicts
and
arbitrary
commands
that
took
the
place
of
law
proceeded
from
masters
thousands
of
miles
away
who
knew
nothing
of
the
country
could
not
understand
its
needs
and
scarcely
tried
to
do
so
in
though
the
mischievous
phantom
of
gold
and
silver
mines
still
haunted
the
colony
we
find
it
reported
that
the
people
were
beginning
to
work
and
were
planting
tobacco
the
king
however
was
losing
patience
with
a
dependency
that
cost
him
endless
expense
and
trouble
and
brought
little
or
nothing
in
return
and
this
at
a
time
when
he
had
a
costly
and
disastrous
war
on
his
hands
and
was
in
no
mood
to
bear
supernumerary
burdens
the
plan
of
giving
over
a
colony
to
a
merchant
or
a
company
of
merchants
was
not
new
it
had
been
tried
in
other
french
colonies
with
disastrous
effect
yet
it
was
now
tried
again
louisiana
was
farmed
out
for
fifteen
years
to
antoine
crozat
a
wealthy
man
of
business
the
countries
made
over
to
him
extended
from
the
british
colonies
on
the
east
to
new
mexico
on
the
west
and
the
rio
del
norte
on
the
south
including
the
entire
region
watered
by
the
mississippi
the
missouri
the
ohio
and
their
tributaries
as
far
north
as
the
illinois
in
comparison
with
this
immense
domain
which
was
all
included
under
the
name
of
louisiana
the
present
state
so
called
is
but
a
small
patch
on
the
american
map
to
crozat
was
granted
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
wholesale
and
retail
domestic
and
foreign
of
all
these
countries
besides
the
product
of
all
mines
after
deducting
reserved
for
the
king
he
was
empowered
to
send
one
vessel
a
year
to
guinea
for
a
cargo
of
slaves
the
king
was
to
pay
the
governor
and
other
crown
officers
and
during
the
first
nine
years
the
troops
also
though
after
that
time
crozat
was
to
maintain
them
till
the
end
of
his
term
in
consideration
of
these
and
other
privileges
the
grantee
was
bound
to
send
to
louisiana
a
specified
number
of
settlers
every
year
his
charter
provided
that
the
royal
edicts
and
the
de
should
be
the
law
of
the
colony
to
be
administered
by
a
council
appointed
by
the
king
when
louisiana
was
thus
handed
over
to
a
speculator
for
a
term
of
years
it
needed
no
prophet
to
foretell
that
he
would
get
all
he
could
out
of
it
and
put
as
little
into
it
as
possible
when
crozat
took
possession
of
the
colony
the
french
court
had
been
thirteen
years
at
work
in
building
it
up
the
result
of
its
labors
was
a
total
population
including
troops
government
officials
and
clergy
of
souls
of
whom
were
in
the
king
pay
only
a
few
of
the
colonists
were
within
the
limits
of
the
present
louisiana
the
rest
lived
in
or
around
the
feeble
stockade
forts
at
mobile
biloxi
ship
island
and
dauphin
island
this
last
station
had
been
partially
abandoned
but
some
of
the
colonists
proposed
to
return
to
it
in
order
to
live
by
fishing
and
only
waited
we
are
told
for
help
from
the
king
this
incessant
dependence
on
government
relaxed
the
fibres
of
the
colony
and
sapped
its
the
king
was
now
exchanged
for
crozat
and
his
grinding
monopoly
the
colonists
had
carried
on
a
modest
trade
with
the
spaniards
at
pensacola
in
skins
fowls
indian
corn
and
a
few
other
articles
bringing
back
a
little
money
in
return
this
their
only
source
of
profit
was
now
cut
off
they
could
sell
nothing
even
to
one
another
they
were
forbidden
to
hold
meetings
without
permission
but
some
of
them
secretly
drew
up
a
petition
to
la
who
was
still
the
official
chief
of
the
colony
begging
that
the
agents
of
crozat
should
be
restricted
to
wholesale
dealings
and
that
the
inhabitants
might
be
allowed
to
trade
at
retail
cadillac
denounced
the
petition
as
seditious
threatened
to
hang
the
bearer
of
it
and
deigned
no
other
answer
he
resumed
his
sarcasms
against
the
colony
in
my
opinion
this
country
is
not
worth
a
straw
vaut
pas
un
the
inhabitants
are
eager
to
be
taken
out
of
it
the
soldiers
are
always
grumbling
and
with
reason
as
to
the
council
which
was
to
be
the
only
court
of
justice
he
says
that
no
such
thing
is
possible
because
there
are
no
proper
persons
to
compose
it
and
though
duclos
the
new
intendant
has
proposed
two
candidates
the
first
of
these
the
sieur
de
lafresnière
learned
to
sign
his
name
only
four
months
ago
and
the
other
being
chief
surgeon
of
the
colony
is
too
busy
to
serve
between
bienville
the
late
governor
and
la
who
had
supplanted
him
there
was
a
standing
quarrel
and
the
colony
was
split
into
hostile
factions
led
by
the
two
disputants
the
minister
at
versailles
was
beset
by
their
mutual
accusations
and
bienville
wrote
that
his
refusal
to
marry
cadillac
daughter
was
the
cause
of
the
spite
the
governor
bore
him
the
indefatigable
curé
de
la
vente
sent
to
ponchartrain
a
memorial
in
the
preamble
of
which
he
says
that
since
monsieur
le
ministre
wishes
to
be
informed
exactly
of
the
state
of
things
in
louisiana
he
la
vente
has
the
honor
with
malice
to
nobody
to
make
known
the
pure
truth
after
which
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
inhabitants
are
nearly
all
drunkards
gamblers
blasphemers
and
enemies
of
everything
good
and
he
proceeds
to
illustrate
the
statement
with
many
particulars
as
the
inhabitants
were
expected
to
work
for
crozat
and
not
for
themselves
it
naturally
followed
that
they
would
not
work
at
all
and
idleness
produced
the
usual
results
the
yearly
shipment
of
girls
continued
but
there
was
difficulty
in
finding
husbands
for
them
the
reason
was
not
far
to
seek
duclos
the
intendant
reports
the
arrival
of
an
invoice
of
twelve
of
them
so
ugly
that
the
inhabitants
are
in
no
hurry
to
take
them
the
canadians
who
formed
the
most
vigorous
and
valuable
part
of
the
population
much
preferred
indian
squaws
it
seems
to
me
pursues
the
intendant
that
in
the
choice
of
girls
good
looks
should
be
more
considered
than
virtue
this
latter
requisite
seems
at
the
time
to
have
found
no
more
attention
than
the
other
since
the
candidates
for
matrimony
were
drawn
from
the
parisian
hospitals
and
houses
of
correction
from
the
former
of
which
crozat
was
authorized
to
take
one
hundred
girls
a
year
in
order
to
increase
the
population
these
hospitals
were
compulsory
asylums
for
the
poor
and
vagrant
of
both
sexes
of
whom
the
great
hôpital
général
of
paris
contained
at
one
time
more
than
six
thousand
crozat
had
built
his
chief
hopes
of
profit
on
a
trade
contraband
or
otherwise
with
the
mexican
ports
but
the
spanish
officials
faithful
instruments
of
the
exclusive
policy
of
their
government
would
not
permit
it
and
were
so
vigilant
that
he
could
not
elude
them
at
the
same
time
to
his
vexation
he
found
that
the
king
officers
in
louisiana
with
more
address
or
better
luck
and
in
contempt
of
his
monopoly
which
it
was
their
business
to
protect
carried
on
for
their
own
profit
a
small
smuggling
trade
with
vera
cruz
he
complained
that
they
were
always
thwarting
his
agents
and
conspiring
against
his
interests
at
last
finding
no
resource
left
but
an
unprofitable
trade
with
the
indians
he
gave
up
his
charter
which
had
been
a
bane
to
the
colony
and
a
loss
to
himself
louisiana
returned
to
the
crown
and
was
soon
passed
over
to
the
new
mississippi
company
called
also
the
western
company
that
charlatan
of
genius
the
scotchman
john
law
had
undertaken
with
the
eager
support
of
the
regent
duke
of
orleans
to
deliver
france
from
financial
ruin
through
a
prodigious
system
of
credit
of
which
louisiana
with
its
imaginary
gold
mines
was
made
the
basis
the
government
used
every
means
to
keep
up
the
stock
of
the
mississippi
company
it
was
ordered
that
the
notes
of
the
royal
bank
and
all
certificates
of
public
debt
should
be
accepted
at
par
in
payment
for
its
shares
powers
and
privileges
were
lavished
on
it
it
was
given
the
monopoly
of
the
french
the
monopoly
of
tobacco
the
profits
of
the
royal
mint
and
the
farming
of
the
revenues
of
the
kingdom
ingots
of
gold
pretending
to
have
come
from
the
new
eldorado
of
louisiana
were
displayed
in
the
of
paris
the
fever
of
speculation
rose
to
madness
and
the
shares
of
the
company
were
inflated
to
monstrous
and
insane
proportions
when
crozat
resigned
his
charter
louisiana
by
the
highest
estimates
contained
about
seven
hundred
souls
including
soldiers
but
not
blacks
or
indians
crozat
successors
however
say
that
the
whole
number
of
whites
men
women
and
children
was
not
above
four
hundred
when
the
mississippi
company
took
the
colony
in
charge
it
was
but
a
change
of
despots
louisiana
was
a
prison
but
while
no
inhabitant
could
leave
it
without
permission
of
the
authorities
all
jews
were
expelled
and
all
protestants
excluded
the
colonists
could
buy
nothing
except
from
the
agents
of
the
company
and
sell
nothing
except
to
the
same
masters
always
at
prices
fixed
by
them
foreign
vessels
were
forbidden
to
enter
any
port
of
louisiana
on
pain
of
confiscation
the
coin
in
circulation
was
nearly
all
spanish
and
in
less
than
two
years
the
company
by
a
series
of
decrees
made
changes
of
about
eighty
per
cent
in
its
value
freedom
of
conscience
freedom
of
speech
of
trade
and
of
action
were
alike
denied
hence
voluntary
immigration
was
not
to
be
expected
but
says
the
duc
de
the
government
wished
to
establish
effective
settlements
in
these
vast
countries
after
the
example
of
the
english
and
therefore
in
order
to
people
them
vagabonds
and
beggars
male
and
female
including
many
women
of
the
town
were
seized
for
the
purpose
both
in
paris
and
throughout
france
approves
these
proceedings
in
themselves
as
tending
at
once
to
purge
france
and
people
louisiana
but
thinks
the
business
was
managed
in
a
way
to
cause
needless
exasperation
among
the
lower
classes
in
it
was
ordered
by
royal
edict
that
no
more
vagabonds
or
criminals
should
be
sent
to
louisiana
the
edict
it
seems
touched
only
one
sex
for
in
the
next
year
eighty
girls
were
sent
to
the
colony
from
the
parisian
house
of
correction
called
the
salpêtrière
there
had
been
a
more
or
less
constant
demand
for
wives
as
appears
by
letters
still
preserved
in
the
archives
of
paris
the
following
extract
from
one
of
which
is
remarkable
for
the
freedom
with
which
the
writer
a
de
chassin
takes
it
upon
him
to
address
a
minister
of
state
in
a
court
where
punctilio
reigned
supreme
you
see
monseigneur
that
nothing
is
wanting
now
to
make
a
solid
settlement
in
louisiana
but
a
certain
piece
of
furniture
which
one
often
repents
having
got
and
with
which
i
shall
dispense
like
the
rest
till
the
company
sends
us
girls
who
have
at
least
some
show
of
virtue
if
there
happens
to
be
any
young
woman
of
your
acquaintance
who
wants
to
make
the
voyage
for
love
of
me
i
should
be
much
obliged
to
her
and
would
do
my
best
to
show
her
my
gratitude
the
company
which
was
invested
with
sovereign
powers
began
its
work
by
sending
to
louisiana
three
companies
of
soldiers
and
colonists
its
wisest
act
was
the
removal
of
the
governor
who
had
supplanted
la
and
the
reappointment
of
bienville
in
his
place
bienville
immediately
sought
out
a
spot
for
establishing
a
permanent
station
on
the
mississippi
fifty
men
were
sent
to
clear
the
ground
and
in
spite
of
an
inundation
which
overflowed
it
for
a
time
the
feeble
foundations
of
new
orleans
were
laid
louisiana
hitherto
diffused
through
various
petty
cantonments
far
and
near
had
at
last
a
capital
or
the
germ
of
one
it
was
the
sixth
of
september
when
the
charter
of
the
mississippi
company
was
entered
in
the
registers
of
the
parliament
of
paris
and
from
that
time
forward
before
the
offices
of
the
company
in
the
rue
quincampoix
crowds
of
crazed
speculators
jostled
and
fought
from
morning
till
night
to
get
their
names
inscribed
among
the
stockholders
within
five
years
after
the
huge
glittering
bubble
had
burst
the
shares
each
one
of
which
had
seemed
a
fortune
found
no
more
purchasers
and
in
its
fall
the
company
dragged
down
with
it
its
ally
and
chief
creditor
the
bank
all
was
dismay
and
despair
except
in
those
who
had
sold
out
in
time
and
turned
delusive
paper
into
solid
values
john
law
lately
the
idol
and
reputed
savior
of
france
fled
for
his
life
amid
a
howl
of
execration
yet
the
interests
of
the
kingdom
required
that
louisiana
should
be
sustained
the
illusions
that
had
given
to
the
mississippi
company
a
morbid
and
intoxicated
vitality
were
gone
but
the
company
lingered
on
and
the
government
still
lent
it
a
helping
hand
a
french
writer
remarks
that
the
few
frenchmen
who
were
famishing
on
the
shores
of
the
mississippi
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
had
cost
the
king
since
the
colony
began
more
than
livres
a
year
the
directors
of
the
company
reported
that
they
had
shipped
persons
to
the
colony
besides
four
hundred
already
there
when
they
took
possession
and
that
still
remained
the
rest
having
died
or
escaped
besides
this
importation
of
whites
they
had
also
brought
six
hundred
slaves
from
guinea
it
is
reckoned
that
the
king
crozat
and
the
mississippi
company
had
spent
among
them
about
eight
million
livres
on
louisiana
without
any
return
the
bursting
of
the
mississippi
bubble
did
not
change
the
principles
of
administration
in
louisiana
the
settlers
always
looking
to
france
to
supply
their
needs
and
protect
them
against
their
own
improvidence
were
in
the
habit
of
butchering
for
food
the
livestock
sent
them
for
propagation
the
remedy
came
in
the
shape
of
a
royal
edict
forbidding
any
colonist
to
kill
without
permission
of
the
authorities
any
cow
sheep
or
lamb
belonging
to
himself
on
pain
of
a
fine
of
three
hundred
livres
or
to
kill
any
horse
cow
or
bull
belonging
to
another
on
pain
of
death
authority
and
order
were
the
watchwords
and
disorder
was
the
rule
the
agents
of
power
quarrelled
among
themselves
except
when
they
leagued
together
to
deceive
their
transatlantic
masters
and
cover
their
own
misdeeds
each
maligned
the
other
and
it
was
scarcely
possible
for
the
king
or
the
company
to
learn
the
true
state
of
affairs
in
their
distant
colony
accusations
were
renewed
against
bienville
till
in
he
was
ordered
to
france
to
give
account
of
his
conduct
and
the
sieur
perier
was
sent
out
to
take
his
place
perier
had
no
easy
task
the
natchez
indians
among
whom
the
french
had
made
a
settlement
and
built
a
fort
called
fort
rosalie
suddenly
rose
on
their
white
neighbors
and
massacred
nearly
all
of
them
then
followed
a
long
course
of
indian
wars
the
french
believed
that
there
was
a
general
conspiracy
among
the
southern
tribes
for
their
destruction
though
this
was
evidently
an
exaggeration
of
the
danger
which
however
was
serious
the
chickasaws
a
brave
and
warlike
people
living
chiefly
in
what
is
now
western
tennessee
and
kentucky
made
common
cause
with
the
natchez
while
the
more
numerous
choctaws
most
of
whose
villages
were
in
the
present
state
of
mississippi
took
part
with
the
french
more
than
a
thousand
soldiers
had
been
sent
to
louisiana
but
perier
pronounced
them
so
bad
that
they
seem
to
have
been
made
on
purpose
for
the
colony
there
were
also
about
eight
hundred
militia
perier
showed
little
vigor
and
had
little
success
his
chief
resource
was
to
set
the
tribes
against
one
another
he
reports
that
his
indian
allies
had
brought
him
a

as
the

complains
there
was
no
dislodging
the
defenders
without

in
this
state
of

the
directors
of
the

company
whose
affairs
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
declared
that
they
could
no
longer
bear
the
burden
of
louisiana
and
begged
the
king
to
take
it
off

the

therefore
transferred

of

to

of

reported
that

to

and
bienville
adds
that
during
the
past
year
they
had
subsisted
for
three
months
on
the
seed
of
reeds
and
wild
grasses
the
white
population
had
rather
diminished
than
increased
during
the
last
twelve
years
while
the
blacks
who
had
lately
conspired
to
massacre
all
the
french
along
the
mississippi
had
multiplied
to
two
thousand
a
french
writer
says
there
must
have
been
a
worm
gnawing
the
root
of
the
tree
that
had
been
transplanted
into
so
rich
a
soil
to
make
it
wither
instead
of
growing
what
it
needed
was
the
air
of
liberty
but
the
air
of
liberty
is
malaria
to
those
who
have
not
learned
to
breathe
it
the
english
colonists
throve
in
it
because
they
and
their
forefathers
had
been
trained
in
a
school
of
and
and
what
would
have
been
intoxication
for
others
was
vital
force
to
them
bienville
found
the
colony
again
threatened
with
a
general
rising
or
as
he
calls
it
a
revolt
of
the
indian
tribes
the
carolina
traders
having
no
advantage
of
had
journeyed
by
land
with
through
a
thousand
miles
of
wilderness
and
with
the
aid
of
gifts
had
instigated
the
tribes
to
attack
the
french
the
chickasaws
especially
friends
of
the
english
and
of
louisiana
became
so
threatening
that
a
crushing
blow
against
them
was
thought
indispensable
the
forces
of
the
colony
were
mustered
to
attempt
it
the
enterprise
was
mismanaged
and
failed
completely
bienville
tried
to
explain
the
disaster
but
his
explanation
was
ill
received
at
court
he
was
severely
rebuked
reproved
at
the
same
time
for
permitting
two
families
to
emigrate
to
domingo
and
sharply
ordered
to
suffer
nobody
to
leave
louisiana
without
express
license
from
versailles
deeply
wounded
he
offered
his
resignation
and
it
was
accepted
whatever
his
failings
he
had
faithfully
served
the
colony
and
gained
from
posterity
the
title
of
father
of
louisiana
with
the
help
of
industrious
nursing
or
one
might
almost
say
in

of
it
louisiana
began
at
last
to
strike
roots
into
the
soil
and
show
signs
of
growth
though
feebly
as
compared
with
its
sturdy
rivals
along
the
atlantic
seaboard
which
had
cost
their

nothing

there

at

made
a
furious
attack
upon

illinois
and
killed
or
carried
off
of
them
a
few
years
later
they
made
another
murderous
onslaught
in
the
same
quarter
they
were
the
scourge
of
the
west
and
no
white
man
could
travel
between

at
the
risk
of
his
life
in
vain
the
french
parleyed

them
threats

alike
their

would
promise
sometimes
in
good
faith
to
keep
the
peace
and
no
more
offend
their
father
onontio
but
nearly
all
the
tribes
of
the
lake
country
were
their
hereditary
enemies
and
some
bloody
revenge
for
ancient
wrongs
would
excite
their
young

to

fury

could
not
restrain

the
canadian
authorities
were
sorely
perplexed
for

fierce
war

indians
and
suppressing
the
outagamie
incendiaries
in
fact
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
their
destruction
they
are
the
common
enemies
of
all
the
western
tribes
he
writes
they
have
lately
murdered
three
frenchmen
and
five
hurons
at
detroit
the
hurons
ask
for
our
help
against
them
and
we
must
give
it
or
all
the
tribes
will
despise
us
he
put
his
chief
trust
in
louvigny
formerly
commandant
at
michilimackinac
that
officer
proposed
to
muster
the
friendly
tribes
and
march
on
the
outagamies
just
as
their
corn
was
ripening
fight
them
if
they
stood
their
ground
or
if
not
destroy
their
crops
burn
their
wigwams
and
encamp
on
the
spot
till
winter
then
send
out
parties
to
harass
them
as
they
roamed
the
woods
seeking
a
meagre
subsistence
by
hunting
in
this
way
he
hoped
to
cripple
if
not
destroy
them
the
outagamies
lived
at
this
time
on
the
fox
river
of
green
bay
a
stream
which
owes
its
name
to
them
their
chief
village
seems
to
have
been
between
thirty
and
forty
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
it
creeps
through
broad
tracts
of
rushes
willows
and
wild
rice
in
spite
of
their
losses
at
detroit
in
their
strength
was
far
from
being
broken
during
two
successive
summers
preparations
were
made
to
attack
them
but
the
march
was
delayed
once
by
the
tardiness
of
the
indian
allies
and
again
by
the
illness
of
louvigny
at
length
on
the
first
of
may
he
left
montreal
with
two
hundred
and
frenchmen
while
two
hundred
more
waited
to
join
him
at
detroit
and
michilimackinac
where
the
indian
allies
were
also
to
meet
him
to
save
expense
in
pay
and
outfit
the
canadians
recruited
for
the
war
were
allowed
to
take
with
them
goods
for
trading
with
the
indians
hence
great
disorder
and
insubordination
especially
as
more
than
forty
barrels
of
brandy
were
carried
in
the
canoes
as
a
part
of
these
commercial
ventures
in
consequence
of
which
we
hear
that
when
french
and
indians
were
encamped
together
hell
was
thrown
open
the
outagamies
stood
their
ground
louvigny
says
with
probable
exaggeration
that
when
he
made
his
attack
their
village
held
five
hundred
warriors
and
no
less
than
three
thousand
women
a
disparity
of
sexes
no
doubt
due
to
the
inveterate
fighting
habits
of
the
tribe
the
wigwams
were
enclosed
by
a
strong
fence
consisting
of
three
rows
of
heavy
oaken
palisades
this
method
of
fortification
was
used
also
by
tribes
farther
southward
when
bienville
attacked
the
chickasaws
he
was
foiled
by
the
solid
wooden
wall
that
resisted
his
cannon
being
formed
of
trunks
of
trees
as
large
as
a
man
body
set
upright
close
together
and
made
by
smaller
trunks
planted
within
so
as
to
close
the
interstices
of
the
outer
row
the
fortified
village
of
the
outagamies
was
of
a
somewhat
different
construction
the
defences
consisted
of
three
rows
of
palisades
those
of
the
middle
row
being
probably
planted
upright
and
the
other
two
set
aslant
against
them
below
along
the
inside
of
the
triple
row
ran
a
sort
of
shallow
trench
or
where
the
defenders
lay
ensconced
firing
through
interstices
left
for
the
purpose
between
the
palisades
louvigny
had
brought
with
him
two
cannon
and
a
mortar
but
being
light
they
had
little
effect
on
the
wooden
wall
and
as
he
was
provided
with
mining
tools
he
resolved
to
attack
the
outagamie
stronghold
by
regular
approaches
as
if
he
were
besieging
a
fortress
of
vauban
covered
by
the
fire
of
three
pieces
of
artillery
and
eight
hundred
french
and
indian
he
opened
trenches
during
the
night
within
seventy
yards
of
the
palisades
pushed
a
sap
sixty
feet
nearer
before
morning
and
on
the
third
night
burrowed
to
within
about
yards
of
the
wall
his
plan
was
to
undermine
and
blow
up
the
palisades
the
outagamies
had
made
a
furious
resistance
in
which
their
women
took
part
with
desperation
but
dreading
the
threatened
explosion
and
unable
to
resist
the
underground
approaches
of
their
enemy
they
asked
for
a
parley
and
owned
themselves
beaten
louvigny
demanded
that
they
should
make
peace
with
all
tribes
friendly
to
the
french
give
up
all
prisoners
and
make
war
on
distant
tribes
such
as
the
pawnees
in
order
to
take
captives
who
should
supply
the
place
of
those
they
had
killed
among
the
allies
of
the
french
that
they
should
pay
in
furs
the
costs
of
the
war
and
give
six
chiefs
or
sons
of
chiefs
as
hostages
for
the
fulfilment
of
these
conditions
on
the
twelfth
of
october
louvigny
reached
quebec
in
triumph
bringing
with
him
the
six
hostages
the
outagamie
question
was
settled
for
a
time
the
tribe
remained
quiet
for
some
years
and
in
sent
a
deputation
to
montreal
and
renewed
their
submission
which
the
governor
accepted
though
they
had
evaded
the
complete
fulfilment
of
the
conditions
imposed
on
them
yet
peace
was
not
secure
for
a
moment
the
kickapoos
and
mascoutins
would
not
leave
their
neighbors
the
illinois
at
rest
the
saginaws
made
raids
on
the
miamis
and
a
general
war
seemed
imminent
the
difficulty
is
inconceivable
of
keeping
these
western
tribes
quiet
writes
the
governor
almost
in
despair
at
length
the
crisis
came
the
illinois
captured
the
nephew
of
oushala
the
principal
outagamie
and
burned
him
alive
on
which
the
outagamies
attacked
them
drove
them
for
refuge
to
the
top
of
the
rock
on
which
la
salle
fort
of
louis
had
been
built
and
held
them
there
at
mercy
they
would
have
starved
to
death
had
not
the
victors
dreading
the
anger
of
the
french
suffered
them
to
escape
for
this
they
took
to
themselves
great
credit
not
without
reason
in
view
of
the
provocation
at
versailles
however
their
attack
on
the
illinois
seemed
an
unpardonable
offence
and
the
next
ship
from
france
brought
a
letter
from
the
colonial
minister
declaring
that
the
outagamies
must
be
effectually
put
down
and
that
his
majesty
will
reward
the
officer
who
will
reduce
or
rather
destroy
them
the
authorities
of
canada
were
less
truculent
than
their
masters
at
the
court
or
were
better
able
to
count
the
costs
of
another
war
longueuil
the
provisional
governor
persisted
in
measures
of
peace
and
the
sieur
de
lignery
called
a
council
of
the
outagamies
and
their
neighbors
the
sacs
and
winnebagoes
at
green
bay
he
told
them
that
the
great
onontio
the
king
ordered
them
at
their
peril
to
make
no
more
attacks
on
the
illinois
and
they
dutifully
promised
to
obey
while
their
great
chief
oushala
begged
that
a
french
officer
might
be
sent
to
his
village
to
help
him
keep
his
young
warriors
from
the
the
pacific
policy
of
longueuil
was
not
approved
by
desliettes
then
commanding
in
the
illinois
country
and
he
proposed
to
settle
accounts
with
the
outagamies
by
exterminating
them
this
is
very
well
observes
a
writer
of
the
time
but
to
try
to
exterminate
them
and
fail
would
be
disastrous
the
marquis
de
beauharnois
who
came
out
as
governor
of
canada
in
was
averse
to
violent
measures
since
if
an
attempt
to
exterminate
the
offending
tribe
should
be
made
without
success
the
life
of
every
frenchman
in
the
west
would
be
in
jeopardy
lignery
thought
that
if
the
outagamies
broke
the
promises
they
had
made
him
at
green
bay
the
forces
of
canada
and
louisiana
should
unite
to
crush
them
the
missionary
chardon
advised
that
they
should
be
cut
off
from
all
supplies
of
arms
ammunition
and
merchandise
of
any
kind
and
that
all
the
western
tribes
should
then
be
set
upon
them
which
he
thought
would
infallibly
bring
them
to
reason
the
new
governor
perplexed
by
the
multitude
of
counsellors
presently
received
a
missive
from
the
king
directing
him
not
to
fight
the
outagamies
if
he
could
help
it
since
the
consequences
of
failure
would
be
frightful
on
the
other
hand
beauharnois
was
told
that
the
english
had
sent
messages
to
the
lake
tribes
urging
them
to
kill
the
french
in
their
country
and
that
the
outagamies
had
promised
to
do
so
this
writes
the
governor
compels
us
to
make
war
in
earnest
it
will
cost
sixty
thousand
livres
dupuy
the
intendant
had
joined
with
beauharnois
in
this
letter
to
the
minister
but
being
at
the
time
in
a
hot
quarrel
with
the
governor
he
soon
after
sent
a
communication
of
his
own
to
versailles
in
which
he
declares
that
the
war
against
the
outagamies
was
only
a
pretext
of
beauharnois
for
spending
the
king
money
and
enriching
himself
by
buying
up
all
the
furs
of
the
countries
traversed
by
the
army
whatever
the
motives
of
the
expedition
it
left
montreal
in
june
under
the
sieur
de
lignery
followed
the
rugged
old
route
of
the
ottawa
and
did
not
reach
michilimackinac
till
after
midsummer
thence
in
a
flotilla
of
birch
canoes
carrying
about
a
thousand
indians
and
five
hundred
french
the
party
set
out
for
the
fort
at
the
head
of
green
bay
here
they
caught
one
outagamie
warrior
and
three
winnebagoes
whom
the
indian
allies
tortured
to
death
then
they
paddled
their
canoes
up
fox
river
reached
a
winnebago
village
on
the
of
august
followed
the
channel
of
the
stream
a
ribbon
of
lazy
water
twisting
in
a
vague
perplexing
way
through
the
broad
marsh
of
wild
rice
and
flags
till
they
saw
the
chief
village
of
the
outagamies
on
a
tract
of
rising
ground
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
bog
it
consisted
of
bark
wigwams
without
palisades
or
defences
of
any
kind
its
only
inmates
were
three
squaws
and
one
old
man
these
were
all
seized
and
to
the
horror
of
père
crespel
the
chaplain
were
given
to
the
indian
allies
who
kept
the
women
as
slaves
and
burned
the
old
man
at
a
slow
fire
then
after
burning
the
village
and
destroying
the
crop
of
maize
peas
beans
and
squashes
that
surrounded
it
the
whole
party
returned
to
michilimackinac
the
expedition
was
not
a
success
lignery
had
hoped
to
surprise
the
enemy
but
the
alert
and
nimble
savages
had
escaped
him
beauharnois
makes
the
best
of
the
miscarriage
and
writes
that
the
army
did
good
work
but
says
a
few
weeks
later
that
something
must
be
done
to
cure
the
contempt
which
the
western
allies
of
the
french
have
conceived
for
them
since
the
last
affair
two
years
after
lignery
expedition
there
was
another
attempt
to
humble
the
outagamies
late
in
the
autumn
of
young
coulon
de
villiers
who
years
later
defeated
washington
at
fort
necessity
appeared
at
quebec
with
news
that
the
sieur
de
villiers
his
father
who
commanded
the
post
on
the
joseph
had
struck
the
outagamies
a
deadly
blow
and
killed
two
hundred
of
their
warriors
besides
six
hundred
of
their
women
and
children
the
force
under
villiers
consisted
of
a
body
of
frenchmen
gathered
from
various
western
posts
another
body
from
the
illinois
led
by
the
sieurs
de
father
and
son
and
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
indian
allies
from
many
friendly
tribes
the
accounts
of
this
affair
are
obscure
and
not
very
trustworthy
it
seems
that
the
outagamies
began
the
fray
by
an
attack
on
the
illinois
at
la
salle
old
station
of
le
rocher
on
the
river
illinois
on
hearing
of
this
the
french
commanders
mustered
their
indian
allies
hastened
to
the
spot
and
found
the
outagamies
intrenched
in
a
grove
which
they
had
surrounded
with
a
stockade
they
defended
themselves
with
their
usual
courage
but
being
hard
pressed
by
hunger
and
thirst
as
well
as
by
the
greatly
superior
numbers
of
their
assailants
they
tried
to
escape
during
a
dark
night
as
their
tribesmen
had
done
at
detroit
in
the
french
and
their
allies
pursued
and
there
was
a
great
slaughter
in
which
many
warriors
and
many
more
women
and
children
were
the
victims
the
offending
tribe
must
now
one
would
think
have
ceased
to
be
dangerous
but
nothing
less
than
its
destruction
would
content
the
french
officials
to
this
end
their
best
resource
was
in
their
indian
allies
among
whom
the
outagamies
had
no
more
deadly
enemy
than
the
hurons
of
detroit
who
far
from
relenting
in
view
of
their
disasters
were
more
eager
than
ever
to
wreak
their
ire
on
their
unfortunate
foe
accordingly
they
sent
messengers
to
the
converted
iroquois
at
the
mission
of
two
mountains
and
invited
them
to
join
in
making
an
end
of
the
outagamies
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
in
the
autumn
of
warriors
from
the
two
mountains
appeared
at
detroit
the
party
was
soon
made
up
it
consisted
of
hurons
iroquois
and
four
ottawas
they
took
the
trail
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
joseph
thence
around
the
head
of
lake
michigan
to
the
chicago
portage
and
thence
westward
to
rock
river
here
were
the
villages
of
the
kickapoos
and
mascoutins
who
had
been
allies
of
the
outagamies
but
having
lately
quarrelled
with
them
received
the
strangers
as
friends
and
gave
them
guides
the
party
now
filed
northward
by
forests
and
prairies
towards
the
wisconsin
to
the
banks
of
which
stream
the
outagamies
had
lately
removed
their
villages
the
warriors
were
all
on
for
the
weather
was
cold
and
the
snow
deep
some
of
the
elders
overcome
by
the
hardships
of
the
way
called
a
council
and
proposed
to
turn
back
but
the
juniors
were
for
pushing
on
at
all
risks
and
a
young
warrior
declared
that
he
would
rather
die
than
go
home
without
killing
somebody
the
result
was
a
division
of
the
party
the
elders
returned
to
chicago
and
the
younger
men
forty
hurons
and
thirty
iroquois
kept
on
their
way
at
last
as
they
neared
the
wisconsin
they
saw
on
an
open
prairie
three
outagamies
who
ran
for
their
lives
the
hurons
and
iroquois
gave
chase
till
from
the
ridge
of
a
hill
they
discovered
the
principal
outagamie
village
consisting
if
we
may
believe
their
own
story
of
wigwams
near
the
bank
of
the
river
the
outagamie
warriors
came
out
to
meet
them
in
number
as
they
pretended
much
greater
than
theirs
but
the
huron
and
iroquois
chiefs
reminded
their
followers
that
they
had
to
do
with
dogs
who
did
not
believe
in
god
on
which
they
fired
two
volleys
against
the
enemy
then
dropped
their
guns
and
charged
with
the
knife
in
one
hand
and
the
in
the
other
according
to
their
own
story
which
shows
every
sign
of
mendacity
they
drove
back
the
outagamies
into
their
village
killed
seventy
warriors
and
captured
fourteen
more
without
counting
eighty
women
and
children
killed
and
a
hundred
and
forty
taken
prisoners
in
short
they
would
have
us
believe
that
they
destroyed
the
whole
village
except
ten
men
who
escaped
entirely
naked
and
soon
froze
to
death
they
declared
further
that
they
sent
one
of
their
prisoners
to
the
remaining
outagamie
villages
ordering
him
to
tell
the
inhabitants
that
they
had
just
devoured
the
better
part
of
the
tribe
and
meant
to
stay
on
the
spot
two
days
that
the
tribesmen
of
the
slain
were
free
to
attack
them
if
they
chose
but
in
that
case
they
would
split
the
heads
of
all
the
women
and
children
prisoners
in
their
hands
make
a
breastwork
of
the
dead
bodies
and
then
finish
it
by
piling
upon
it
those
of
the
assailants
nothing
is
more
misleading
than
indian
tradition
which
is
of
the
least
possible
value
as
evidence
it
may
be
well
however
to
mention
another
story
often
repeated
touching
these
dark
days
of
the
outagamies
it
is
to
the
effect
that
a
french
trader
named
marin
whom
they
had
incensed
by
levying
blackmail
from
him
raised
a
party
of
indians
with
whose
aid
he
surprised
and
defeated
the
unhappy
tribe
at
the
little
butte
des
morts
that
they
retired
to
the
great
butte
des
morts
higher
up
fox
river
and
that
marin
here
attacked

the

it

gave
a
strong
impulse

stimulating

and
get

and
to
these
motives
was
soon
added
the
hope
of

it

with

spirit
of

who
led
the
way
in

path

as
a
bold

the

in
america
has
rarely
found
his
match
his
civic
virtues
withered
under
the
despotism
of
versailles
and
his
mind
and
conscience
were
kept
in
by
an
absolute
church
but
the
forest
and
the
prairie
offered
him
an
unbridled
liberty
which
lawless
as
it
was
gave
scope
to
his
energies
till
these
savage
wastes
became
the
field
of
his
most
noteworthy
achievements
canada
was
divided
between
two
opposing
influences
on
the
one
side
were
the
monarchy
and
the
hierarchy
with
their
principles
of
order
subordination
and
obedience
substantially
at
one
in
purpose
since
both
wished
to
keep
the
colony
within
manageable
bounds
domesticate
it
and
tame
it
to
soberness
regularity
and
obedience
on
the
other
side
was
the
spirit
of
liberty
or
license
which
was
in
the
very
air
of
this
wilderness
continent
reinforced
in
the
chiefs
of
the
colony
by
a
spirit
of
adventure
inherited
from
the
middle
ages
and
by
a
spirit
of
trade
born
of
present
opportunities
for
every
official
in
canada
hoped
to
make
a
profit
if
not
a
fortune

of
kindred
impulses

forms

into
the
forest
and
made

and

though
turbulent
and
lawless
members
of
civilized
society
time
the
decline
of
the
and
the
influence
of
the
canadian
church
gradually
diminished
this
erratic
spirit
and
at
the
same
time
impaired
the
qualities
that
were
associated
with
it
the
canadian
became
a
more
stable
colonist
and
a
steadier
farmer
but
for
forest
journeyings
and
forest
warfare
he
was
scarcely
his
former
self
at
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
we
find
complaints
that
the
race
of
is
growing
scarce
the
taming
process
was
most
apparent
in
the
central
and
lower
parts
of
the
colony
such
as
the
côte
de
beaupré
and
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lawrence
where
the
hands
of
the
government
and
of
the
church
were
strong
while
at
the
head
of
the
colony
that
is
about
montreal
and
its
neighborhood
which
touched
the
primeval
wilderness
an
uncontrollable
spirit
of
adventure
still
held
its
own
here
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
this
spirit
was
as
strong
as
it
had
ever
been
and
achieved
a
series
of
explorations
and
discoveries
which
revealed
the
plains
of
the
far
west
long
before
an
foot
had
pressed
their
soil
the
expedition
of
one
le
sueur
to
what
is
now
the
state
of
minnesota
may
be
taken
as
the
of
these
enterprises
le
sueur
had
visited
the
country
of
the
sioux
as
early
as
he
returned
thither
in
with
the
famous
nicolas
perrot
four
years
later
count
frontenac
sent
him
to
the
sioux
country
again
the
declared
purpose
of
the
mission
was
to
keep
those
fierce
tribes
at
peace
with
their
neighbors
but
the
governor
enemies
declared
that
a
contraband
trade
in
beaver
was
the
true
object
and
that
frontenac
secretary
was
to
have
half
the
profits
le
sueur
returned
after
two
years
bringing
to
montreal
a
sioux
chief
and
his
squaw
the
first
of
the
tribe
ever
seen
there
he
then
went
to
france
and
represented
to
the
court
that
he
had
built
a
fort
at
lake
pepin
on
the
upper
mississippi
that
he
was
the
only
white
man
who
knew
the
languages
of
that
region
and
that
if
the
french
did
not
speedily
seize
upon
it
the
english
who
were
already
trading
upon
the
ohio
would
be
sure
to
do
so
thereupon
he
asked
for
the
command
of
the
upper
mississippi
with
all
its
tributary
waters
together
with
a
monopoly
of
its
for
ten
years
and
permission
to
work
its
mines
promising
that
if
his
petition
were
granted
he
would
secure
the
country
to
france
without
expense
to
the
king
the
commission
was
given
him
he
bought
an
outfit
and
sailed
for
canada
but
was
captured
by
the
english
on
the
way
after
the
peace
he
returned
to
france
and
begged
for
a
renewal
of
his
commission
leave
was
given
him
to
work
the
copper
and
lead
mines
but
not
to
trade
in
he
now
formed
a
company
to
aid
him
in
his
enterprise
on
which
a
cry
rose
in
canada
that
under
pretence
of
working
mines
he
meant
to
trade
in
beaver
which
is
very
likely
since
to
bring
lead
and
copper
in
bark
canoes
to
montreal
from
the
mississippi
and
lake
superior
would
cost
far
more
than
the
metal
was
worth
in
consequence
of
this
clamor
his
commission
was
revoked
perhaps
it
was
to
compensate
him
for
the
outlays
into
which
he
had
been
drawn
that
the
colonial
minister
presently
authorized
him
to
embark
for
louisiana
and
pursue
his
enterprise
with
that
infant
colony
instead
of
canada
as
his
base
of
operations
thither
therefore
he
went
and
in
april
set
out
for
the
sioux
country
with
men
in
a
small
vessel
of
the
kind
called
a
felucca
still
used
in
the
mediterranean
among
the
party
was
an
adventurous
youth
named
penecaut
a
by

who
had
come
to
louisiana
with
iberville
two
years
before
and
who
has
left
us
an
account
of
his
voyage
with
le
sueur
the
party
slowly
made
their
way
with
sail
and
oar
against
the
muddy
current
of
the
mississippi
till
they
reached
the
arkansas
where
they
found
an
english
trader
from
carolina
on
the
tenth
of
june
spent
with
rowing
and
half
starved
they
stopped
to
rest
at
a
point
fifteen
leagues
above
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
they
had
staved
off
famine
with
the
buds
and
leaves
of
trees
but
now
by
good
luck
one
of
them
killed
a
bear
and
soon
after
the
jesuit
limoges
arrived
from
the
neighboring
mission
of
the
illinois
in
a
canoe
well
stored
with
provisions
thus
refreshed
they
passed
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
on
the
thirteenth
of
july
and
soon
after
were
met
by
three
canadians
who
brought
them
a
letter
from
the
jesuit
marest
warning
them
that
the
river
was
infested
by
in
fact
they
presently
saw
seven
canoes
of
sioux
warriors
bound
against
the
illinois
and
not
long
after
five
canadians
appeared
one
of
whom
had
been
badly
wounded
in
a
recent
encounter
with
a
band
of
outagamies
sacs
and
winnebagoes
bound
against

been
for
ages
the
absorbing
business
and
favorite
recreation
of
all
these
western
tribes
at
or
near
the
expansion
of
the
mississippi
called

pepin
the
voyagers
found
a
fort
called

perrot
after
its
builder
and
on
an
island
near
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
another
similar
structure
built
by
le
sueur
himself
on
his
last
visit
to
the
place
these
forts
were
mere
stockades
occupied
from
time
to
time
by
the
roving
as
their
occasions
required
towards
the
end
of
september
le
sueur
and
his
followers
reached
the
mouth
of
the
peter
which
they
ascended
to
blue
earth
river
pushing
a
league
up
this
stream
they
found
a
spot
well
suited
to
their
purpose
and
here
they
built
a
fort
of
which
there
was
great
need
for
they
were
soon
after
joined
by
seven
canadian
traders
plundered
and
stripped
to
the
skin
by
the
neighboring
sioux

was
a
fence
of

enclosing

men
the
neighboring
plains
were
black
with
buffalo
of
which
the
party
killed
four
hundred
and
cut
them
into
quarters
which
they
placed
to
freeze
on
scaffolds
within
the
enclosure
here
they
spent
the
winter
subsisting
on
the
frozen
meat
without
bread
vegetables
or
salt
and
according
to
penecaut
thriving
marvellously
though
the
surrounding
wilderness
was
buried
five
feet
deep
in

with

and
their
sturdy
and
squaws
burdened
with
the
heavy
hide

of
their
teepees
or
tents
they
professed

and
begged
for

those
of
one
band
had
blackened
their
faces
in
mourning
for
a
dead
chief
and
calling
on
le
sueur
to
share
their
sorrow
they
wept
over
him
and
wiped
their
tears
on
his
hair
another
party
of
warriors
arrived
with
yet
deeper
cause
of
grief
being
the
remnant
of
a
village
half
exterminated
by
their
enemies
they
too
wept
profusely
over
the
french
commander
and
then
sang
a
dismal
song
with
heads
muffled
in
their
le
sueur
took
the
needful
precautions
against
his
dangerous
visitors
but
got
from
them
a
large
supply
of
in
exchange
for
his
goods
when
spring
opened
he
set
out
in
search
of
mines
and
found
not
far
above
the
fort
those
beds
of
blue
and
green
earth
to
which
the
stream
owes
its
name
of
this
his
men
dug
out
a
large
quantity
and
selecting
what
seemed
the
best
stored
it
in
their
vessel
as
a
precious
commodity
with
this
and
good
store
of

now
began
his

named

twelve

to
keep

should
come
back
to

to
send
him

range
stretched
to
the
black
hills
and
perhaps
to
the
rocky
mountains
he
reached
the
settlements
of
louisiana
in
safety
and
sailed
for
france
with
four
thousand
pounds
of
his
worthless
blue
earth
repairing
at
once
to
versailles
he
begged
for
help
to
continue
his
enterprise
his
petition
seems
to
have
been
granted
after
long
delay
he
sailed
again
for
louisiana
fell
ill
on
the
voyage
and
died
soon
after
landing
before
the
year
when
le
sueur
visited
the
peter
little
or
nothing
was
known
of
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
except
from
the
report
of
indians
the
romances
of
la
hontan
and
mathieu
sâgean
were
justly
set
down
as
impostures
by
all
but
the
most
credulous
in
this
same
year
we
find
le
moyne
projecting
journeys
to
the
upper
missouri
in
hopes
of
finding
a
river
flowing
to
the
western
sea
in
twenty
canadians
tried
to
find
their
way
from
the
illinois
to
new
mexico
in
hope
of
opening
trade
with
the
spaniards
and
discovering
mines
in
we
find
it
reported
that
more
than
a
hundred
canadians
are
scattered
in
small
parties
along
the
mississippi
and
the
missouri
and
in
one
laurain
appeared
at
the
illinois
declaring
that
he
had
been
high
up
the
missouri
and
had
visited
many
tribes
on
its
borders
a
few
months
later
two
canadians
told
bienville
a
similar
story
in
nicolas
de
la
salle
proposed
an
expedition
of
a
hundred
men
to
explore
the
same
mysterious
river
and
in
one
hubert
laid
before
the
council
of
marine
a
scheme
for
following
the
missouri
to
its
source
since
he
says
not
only
may
we
find
the
mines
worked
by
the
spaniards
but
also
discover
the
great
river
that
is
said
to
rise
in
the
mountains
where
the
missouri
has
its
source
and
is
believed
to
flow
to
the
western
sea
and
he
advises
that
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
be
sent
up
the
river
in
wooden
canoes
since
bark
canoes
would
be
dangerous
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
snags
in
juchereau
de
was
sent
by
la
to
explore
western
louisiana
and
pushed
up
red
river
to
a
point
leagues
as
he
reckons
above
natchitoches
in
the
next
year
journeying
across
country
towards
the
spanish
settlements
with
a
view
to
trade
he
was
seized
near
the
rio
grande
and
carried
to
the
city
of
mexico
the
spaniards
jealous
of
french
designs
now
sent
priests
and
soldiers
to
occupy
several
points
in
texas
juchereau
however
was
well
treated
and
permitted
to
marry
a
spanish
girl
with
whom
he
had
fallen
in
love
on
the
way
but
when
in
the
autumn
of
he
ventured
another
journey
to
the
mexican
borders
still
hoping
to
be
allowed
to
trade
he
and
his
goods
were
seized
by
order
of
the
mexican
viceroy
and
lest
worse
should
befall
him
he
fled
under
cover
of
night
in
march
bénard
de
la
harpe
left
the
feeble
little
french
post
at
natchitoches
with
six
soldiers
and
a
sergeant
his
errand
was
to
explore
the
country
open
trade
if
possible
with
the
spaniards
and
establish
another
post
high
up
red
river
he
and
his
party
soon
came
upon
that
vast
entanglement
of
driftwood
or
rather
of
uprooted
forests
afterwards
known
as
the
red
river
raft
which
choked
the
stream
and
forced
them
to
make
their
way
through
the
inundated
jungle
that
bordered
it
as
they
pushed
or
dragged
their
canoes
through
the
swamp
they
saw
with
disgust
and
alarm
a
good
number
of
snakes
coiled
about
twigs
and
boughs
on
the
right
and
left
or
sometimes
over
their
heads
these
were
probably
the
deadly
which
in
warm
weather
is
accustomed
to
crawl
out
of
its
favorite
element
and
bask
itself
in
the
sun
precisely
as
described
by
la
harpe
their
nerves
were
further
discomposed
by
the
splashing
and
plunging
of
alligators
lately
wakened
from
their
wintry
torpor
still
they
pushed
painfully
on
till
they
reached
navigable
water
again
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
were
as
they
thought
a
hundred
and
eight
leagues
above
natchitoches
in
four
days
more
they
reached
the
nassonites
these
savages
belonged
to
a
group
of
stationary
tribes
only
one
of
which
the
caddoes
survives
to
our
day
as
a
separate
community
their
enemies
the
chickasaws
osages
arkansas
and
even
the
distant
illinois
waged
such
deadly
war
against
them
that
according
to
la
harpe
the
unfortunate
nassonites
were
in
the
way
of
extinction
their
numbers
having
fallen
within
ten
years
from
hundred
souls
to
four
hundred
la
harpe
stopped
among
them
to
refresh
his
men
and
build
a
house
of
as
a
beginning
of
the
post
he
was
ordered
to
establish
then
having
heard
that
a
war
with
spain
had
ruined
his
hopes
of
trade
with
new
mexico
he
resolved
to
pursue
his
explorations
with
him
went
ten
men
white
red
and
black
with
horses
bought
from
the
indians
for
his
journeyings
were
henceforth
to
be
by
land
the
party
moved
in
a
northerly
and
westerly
course
by
hills
forests
and
prairies
passed
two
branches
of
the
wichita
and
on
the
third
of
september
came
to
a
river
which
la
harpe
calls
the
southwest
branch
of
the
arkansas
but
which
if
his
observation
of
latitude
is
correct
must
have
been
the
main
stream
not
far
from
the
site
of
fort
mann
here
he
was
met
by
seven
indian
chiefs
mounted
on
excellent
horses
saddled
and
bridled
after
the
spanish
manner
they
led
him
to
where
along
the
plateau
of
the
low
treeless
hills
that
bordered
the
valley
he
saw
a
string
of
indian
villages
extending
for
a
league
and
belonging
to
nine
several
bands
the
names
of
which
can
no
longer
be
recognized
and
most
of
which
are
no
doubt
extinct
he
says
that
they
numbered
in
all
six
thousand
souls
and
their
dwellings
were
high
structures
built
of
clay
mixed
with
reeds
and
straw
resting
doubtless
on
a
frame
of
bent
poles
with
them
were
also
some
of
the
roving
indians
of
the
plains
with
their
conical
teepees
of
dressed
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
was
a
great
and
amazing
event
for
these
savages
few
of
whom
had
ever
seen
a
white
man
on
the
day
after
their
arrival
the
whole
multitude
gathered
to
receive
them
and
offer
them
the
calumet
with
a
profusion
of
songs
and
speeches
then
warrior
after
warrior
recounted
his
exploits
and
boasted
of
the
scalps
he
had
taken
from
eight
in
the
morning
till
two
hours
after
midnight
the
din
of
drums
songs
harangues
and
dances
continued
without
relenting
with
a
prospect
of
twelve
hours
more
and
la
harpe
in
desperation
withdrew
to
rest
himself
on
a
begging
another
frenchman
to
take
his
place
his
hosts
left
him
in
peace
for
a
while
then
the
chiefs
came
to
find
him
painted
his
face
blue
as
a
tribute
of
respect
put
a
cap
of
on
his
head
and
laid
numerous
gifts
at
his
feet
when
at
last
the
ceremony
ended
some
of
the
performers
were
so
hoarse
from
incessant
singing
that
they
could
hardly
speak
la
harpe
was
told
by
his
hosts
that
the
spanish
settlements
could
be
reached
by
ascending
their
river
but
to
do
this
was
at
present
impossible
he
began
his
backward
journey
fell
desperately
ill
of
a
fever
and
nearly
died
before
reaching
natchitoches
having
recovered
he
made
an
attempt
two
years
later
to
explore
the
arkansas
in
canoes
from
its
mouth
but
accomplished
little
besides
killing
a
good
number
of
buffalo
bears
deer
and
wild
turkeys
he
was
confirmed
however
in
the
belief
that
the
comanches
and
the
spaniards
of
new
mexico
might
be
reached
by
this
route
in
the
year
of
la
harpe
first
exploration
one
du
tisné
went
up
the
missouri
to
a
point
six
leagues
above
grand
river
where
stood
the
village
of
the
missouris
he
wished
to
go
farther
but
they
would
not
let
him
he
then
returned
to
the
illinois
whence
he
set
out
on
horseback
with
a
few
followers
across
what
is
now
the
state
of
missouri
till
he
reached
the
village
of
the
osages
which
stood
on
a
hill
high
up
the
river
osage
at
first
he
was
well
received
but
when
they
found
him
disposed
to
push
on
to
a
town
of
their
enemies
the
pawnees
forty
leagues
distant
they
angrily
refused
to
let
him
go
his
firmness
and
hardihood
prevailed
and
at
last
they
gave
him
leave
a
ride
of
a
few
days
over
rich
prairies
brought
him
to
the
pawnees
who
coming
as
he
did
from
the
hated
osages
took
him
for
an
enemy
and
threatened
to
kill
him
twice
they
raised
the
tomahawk
over
his
head
but
when
the
intrepid
traveller
dared
them
to
strike
they
began
to
treat
him
as
a
friend
when
however
he
told
them
that
he
meant
to
go
fifteen
days
journey
farther
to
the
padoucas
or
comanches
their
deadly
enemies
they
fiercely
forbade
him
and
after
planting
a
french
flag
in
their
village
he
returned
as
he
had
come
guiding
his
way
by
compass
and
reaching
the
illinois
in
november
after
extreme
hardships
early
in
two
hundred
mounted
spaniards
followed
by
a
large
body
of
comanche
warriors
came
from
new
mexico
to
attack
the
french
at
the
illinois
but
were
met
and
routed
on
the
missouri
by
tribes
of
that
region
in
the
next
year
bienville
was
told
that
they
meant
to
return
punish
those
who
had
defeated
them
and
establish
a
post
on
the
river
kansas
whereupon
he
ordered
boisbriant
commandant
at
the
illinois
to
anticipate
them
by
sending
troops
to
build
a
french
fort
at
or
near
the
same
place
but
the
west
india
company
had
already
sent
one
bourgmont
on
a
similar
errand
the
object
being
to
trade
with
the
spaniards
in
time
of
peace
and
stop
their
incursions
in
time
of
war
it
was
hoped
also
that
in
the
interest
of
trade
peace
might
be
made
between
the
comanches
and
the
tribes
of
the
missouri
bourgmont
was
a
man
of
some
education
and
well
acquainted
with
these
tribes
among
whom
he
had
traded
for
years
in
pursuance
of
his
orders
he
built
a
fort
which
he
named
fort
orléans
and
which
stood
on
the
missouri
not
far
above
the
mouth
of
grand
river
having
thus
accomplished
one
part
of
his
mission
he
addressed
himself
to
the
other
and
prepared
to
march
for
the
comanche
villages
leaving
a
sufficient
garrison
at
the
fort
he
sent
his
ensign
with
a
party
of
soldiers
and
canadians
in
wooden
canoes
to
the
villages
of
the
kansas
higher
up
the
stream
and
on
the
third
of
july
set
out
by
land
to
join
him
with
a
hundred
and
nine
missouri
indians
and
osages
in
his
train
a
ride
of
five
days
brought
him
again
to
the
banks
of
the
missouri
opposite
a
kansas
town
had
not
yet
arrived
the
angry
and
turbid
current
joined
to
fevers
among
his
men
having
retarded
his
progress
meanwhile
bourgmont
drew
from
the
kansas
a
promise
that
their
warriors
should
go
with
him
to
the
comanches
at
last
appeared
and
at
daybreak
of
the
the
tents
were
struck
and
the
loaded
at
six
the
party
drew
up
in
battle
array
on
a
hill
above
the
indian
town
and
then
with
drum
beating
and
flag
flying
began
their
march
a
fine
prairie
country
writes
bourgmont
with
hills
and
dales
and
clumps
of
trees
to
right
and
left
sometimes
the
landscape
quivered
under
the
sultry
sun
and
sometimes
thunder
bellowed
over
their
heads
and
rain
fell
in
floods
on
the
steaming
plains
renaudière
engineer
of
the
party
one
day
stood
by
the
side
of
the
path
and
watched
the
whole
procession
as
it
passed
him
the
white
men
were
about
twenty
in
all
he
counted
about
three
hundred
indian
warriors
with
as
many
squaws
some
five
hundred
children
and
a
prodigious
number
of
dogs
the
largest
and
strongest
of
which
dragged
heavy
loads
the
squaws
also
served
as
beasts
of
burden
and
says
the
journal
they
will
carry
as
much
as
a
dog
will
drag
horses
were
less
abundant
among
these
tribes
than
they
afterwards
became
so
that
their
work
fell
largely
upon
the
women
on
the
sixth
day
the
party
was
within
three
leagues
of
the
river
kansas
at
a
considerable
distance
above
its
mouth
bourgmont
had
suffered
from
dysentery
on
the
march
and
an
access
of
the
malady
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
go
farther
it
is
easy
to
conceive
the
regret
with
which
he
saw
himself
compelled
to
return
to
fort
orléans
the
party
retraced
their
steps
carrying
their
helpless
commander
on
a
litter
first
however
he
sent
one
gaillard
on
a
perilous
errand
taking
with
him
two
comanche
slaves
bought
for
the
purpose
from
the
kansas
gaillard
was
ordered
to
go
to
the
comanche
villages
with
the
message
that
bourgmont
had
been
on
his
way
to
make
them
a
friendly
visit
and
though
stopped
by
illness
hoped
soon
to
try
again
with
better
success
early
in
september
bourgmont
who
had
arrived
safely
at
fort
orléans
received
news
that
the
mission
of
gaillard
had
completely
succeeded
on
which
though
not
wholly
recovered
from
his
illness
he
set
out
again
on
his
errand
of
peace
accompanied
by
his
young
son
besides
renaudière
a
surgeon
and
nine
soldiers
on
reaching
the
great
village
of
the
kansas
he
found
there
five
comanche
chiefs
and
warriors
whom
gaillard
had
induced
to
come
thither
with
him
seven
chiefs
of
the
otoes
presently
appeared
in
accordance
with
an
invitation
of
bourgmont
then
six
chiefs
of
the
iowas
and
the
head
chief
of
the
missouris
with
these
and
the
kansas
chiefs
a
solemn
council
was
held
around
a
fire
before
tent
speeches
were
made
the
pipe
of
peace
was
smoked
and
presents
were
distributed
on
the
eighth
of
october
the
march
began
the
five
comanches
and
the
chiefs
of
several
other
tribes
including
the
omahas
joining
the
cavalcade
gaillard
and
another
frenchman
named
quesnel
were
sent
in
advance
to
announce
their
approach
to
the
comanches
while
bourgmont
and
his
followers
moved
up
the
north
side
of
the
river
kansas
till
the
eleventh
when
they
forded
it
at
a
point
twenty
leagues
from
its
mouth
and
took
a
westward
and
southwestward
course
sometimes
threading
the
grassy
valleys
of
little
streams
sometimes
crossing
the
dry
upland
prairie
covered
with
the
short
tufted
herbage
since
known
as
buffalo
grass
wild
turkeys
clamored
along
every
watercourse
deer
were
seen
on
all
sides
buffalo
were
without
number
sometimes
in
grazing
droves
and
sometimes
dotting
the
endless
plain
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
ruffian
wolves
white
and
gray
eyed
the
travellers
askance
keeping
a
safe
distance
by
day
and
howling
about
the
camp
all
night
of
the
antelope
and
the
elk
the
journal
makes
no
mention
bourgmont
chased
a
buffalo
on
horseback
and
shot
him
with
a
pistol
which
is
probably
the
first
recorded
example
of
that
way
of
hunting
the
stretches
of
high
rolling
treeless
prairie
grew
more
vast
as
the
travellers
advanced
on
the
seventeenth
they
found
an
abandoned
comanche
camp
on
the
next
day
as
they
stopped
to
dine
and
had
just
unsaddled
their
horses
they
saw
a
distant
smoke
towards
the
west
on
which
they
set
the
dry
grass
on
fire
as
an
answering
signal
half
an
hour
later
a
body
of
wild
horsemen
came
towards
them
at
full
speed
and
among
them
were
their
two
couriers
gaillard
and
quesnel
waving
a
french
flag
the
strangers
were
eighty
comanche
warriors
with
the
grand
chief
of
the
tribe
at
their
head
they
dashed
up
to
bourgmont
bivouac
and
leaped
from
their
horses
when
a
general
shaking
of
hands
ensued
after
which
white
men
and
red
seated
themselves
on
the
ground
and
smoked
the
pipe
of
peace
then
all
rode
together
to
the
comanche
camp
three
leagues
distant
bourgmont
pitched
his
tents
at
a
from
the
comanche
lodges
whence
a
crowd
of
warriors
presently
came
to
visit
him
they
spread
on
the
ground
placed
upon
them
the
french
commander
his
officers
and
his
young
son
then
lifted
each
with
its
honored
load
and
carried
them
all
with
yells
of
joy
and
gratulation
to
the
lodge
of
the
great
chief
where
there
was
a
feast
of
ceremony
lasting
till
nightfall
on
the
next
day
bourgmont
displayed
to
his
hosts
the
marvellous
store
of
gifts
he
had
brought
for
them
guns
swords
hatchets
kettles
gunpowder
bullets
red
cloth
blue
cloth
knives
shirts
awls
scissors
needles
hawks
bells
vermilion
beads
and
other
enviable
commodities
of
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
dreamed
two
hundred
savages
gathered
before
the
french
tents
where
bourgmont
with
the
gifts
spread
on
the
ground
before
him
stood
with
a
french
flag
in
his
hand
surrounded
by
his
officers
and
the
indian
chiefs
of
his
party
and
harangued
the
admiring
auditors
he
told
them
that
he
had
come
to
bring
them
a
message
from
the
king
his
master
who
was
the
great
chief
of
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
whose
will
it
was
that
the
comanches
should
live
in
peace
with
his
other
children
the
missouris
osages
kansas
otoes
omahas
and
pawnees
with
whom
they
had
long
been
at
war
that
the
chiefs
of
these
tribes
were
now
present
ready
to
renounce
their
old
enmities
that
the
comanches
should
henceforth
regard
them
as
friends
share
with
them
the
blessing
of
alliance
and
trade
with
the
french
and
give
to
these
last
free
passage
through
their
country
to
trade
with
the
spaniards
of
new
mexico
bourgmont
then
gave
the
french
flag
to
the
great
chief
to
be
kept
forever
as
a
pledge
of
that
day
compact
the
chief
took
the
flag
and
promised
in
behalf
of
his
people
to
keep
peace
inviolate
with
the
indian
children
of
the
king
then
with
unspeakable
delight
he
and
his
tribesmen
took
and
divided
the
gifts
the
next
two
days
were
spent
in
feasts
and
rejoicings
is
it
true
that
you
are
men
asked
the
great
chief
i
have
heard
wonders
of
the
french
but
i
never
could
have
believed
what
i
see
this
day
then
taking
up
a
handful
of
earth
the
spaniards
are
like
this
but
you
are
like
the
sun
and
he
offered
bourgmont
in
case
of
need
the
aid
of
his
two
thousand
comanche
warriors
the
pleasing
manners
of
his
visitors
and
their
unparalleled
generosity
had
completely
won
his
heart
as
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
accomplished
or
seemed
to
be
so
the
party
set
out
on
their
return
a
ride
of
ten
days
brought
them
again
to
the
missouri
they
descended
in
canoes
to
fort
orléans
and
sang
te
deum
in
honor
of
the
peace
no
farther
discovery
in
this
direction
was
made
for
the
next
fifteen
years
though
the
french
had
explored
the
missouri
as
far
as
the
site
of
fort
clark
and
the
mandan
villages
they
were
possessed
by
the
idea
due
perhaps
to
indian
reports
concerning
the
great
tributary
river
the
yellowstone
that
in
its
upper
course
the
main
stream
bent
so
far
southward
as
to
form
a
waterway
to
new
mexico
with
which
it
was
the
constant
desire
of
the
authorities
of
louisiana
to
open
trade
a
way
thither
was
at
last
made
known
by
two
brothers
named
mallet
who
with
six
companions
went
up
the
platte
to
its
south
fork
which
they
called
river
of
the
padoucas
a
name
given
it
on
some
maps
down
to
the
middle
of
this
century
they
followed
the
south
fork
for
some
distance
and
then
turning
southward
and
southwestward
crossed
the
plains
of
colorado
here
the
dried
dung
of
the
buffalo
was
their
only
fuel
and
it
has
continued
to
feed
the
of
the
traveller
in
this
treeless
region
within
the
memory
of
many
now
living
they
crossed
the
upper
arkansas
and
apparently
the
cimarron
passed
taos
and
on
the
of
july
reached
santa
fé
where
they
spent
the
winter
on
the
first
of
may
they
began
their
return
journey
three
of
them
crossing
the
plains
to
the
pawnee
villages
and
the
rest
descending
the
arkansas
to
the
mississippi
the
bold
exploit
of
the
brothers
mallet
attracted
great
attention
at
new
orleans
and
bienville
resolved
to
renew
it
find
if
possible
a
nearer
and
better
way
to
santa
fé
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
these
mysterious
western
regions
and
satisfy
a
lingering
doubt
whether
they
were
not
contiguous
to
china
and
tartary
a
naval
officer
fabry
de
la
bruyère
was
sent
on
this
errand
with
the
brothers
mallet
and
a
few
soldiers
and
canadians
he
ascended
the
canadian
fork
of
the
arkansas
named
by
him
the
andré
became
entangled
in
the
shallows
and
quicksands
of
that
difficult
river
fell
into
disputes
with
his
men
and
after
protracted
efforts
returned
unsuccessful
while
french
enterprise
was
unveiling
the
remote
southwest
two
indomitable
canadians
were
pushing
still
more
noteworthy
explorations

northern
