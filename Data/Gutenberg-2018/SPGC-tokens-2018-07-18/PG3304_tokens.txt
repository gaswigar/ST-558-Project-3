to
think
what
a
whole
lot
of
people
could
do
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
think
what
her
father
could
do
if
he
only
wanted
to
do
it
instead
of
poisoning
the
of
the
city
and
piling
up
his
dirty
millions
go
about
this
town
and
see
the
misery
and
horror
and
think
that
it
jim
hegan
who
sits
at
the
top
and
reaps
the
profit
of
it
all
it
jim
hegan
who
is
back
of
the
organization
he
the
real
power
behind
boss
grimes
it
he
who
puts
up
the
money
and
makes
possible
this
whole
regime
of
vice
and
graft
julia
my
dear
boy
do
be
silly
jack
how
do
you
mean
is
it
true
julia
of
course
it
true
but
why
declaim
to
me
about
it
you
forget
you
are
talking
to
the
champion
female
muckraker
of
the
country
jack
yes
that
right
but
i
do
want
to
meet
these
people
socially
they
mean
well
a
lot
of
them
i
suppose
but
they
been
accustomed
all
their
lives
to
being
people
of
importance
to
have
everybody
stand
in
awe
of
them
because
of
their
stolen
money
and
all
the
wonderful
things
they
might
do
with
it
if
they
only
would
julia
my
dear
jack
did
you
ever
observe
anything
of
the
in
me
jack
no
i
do
know
that
i
have
but
it
never
too
late
julia
laughing
well
until
you
do
have
a
little
faith
in
me
meet
laura
hegan
and
judge
for
yourself
jack
grumbling
all
right
i
meet
her
but
let
me
tell
you
i
do
propose
to
spare
her
feelings
she
get
things
straight
from
me
julia
that
all
right
my
boy
give
her
the
class
war
and
the
revolution
with
a
capital
r
tell
her
you
the
only
original
representative
of
the
disinherited
proletariat
and
that
some
day
before
long
you
intend
to
plant
the
red
flag
over
her
daddy
palace
seriously
of
course
what
you
actually
do
is
meet
her
like
a
gentleman
and
tell
her
of
some
of
your
adventures
in
russia
and
give
her
some
idea
of
what
going
on
outside
of
her
little
fifth
avenue
set
j
ack
where
did
you
run
on
to
her
julia
i
met
her
at
the
settlement
jack
good
lord
jim
hegan
daughter
laughs
they
were
toadying
to
her
there
i
wager
julia
well
you
know
what
settlement
people
are
she
been
coming
there
for
quite
a
while
and
seems
to
be
interested
she
given
them
quite
a
lot
of
money
jack
no
doubt
julia
i
had
a
little
talk
with
her
one
afternoon
she
a
quiet
girl
but
she
gave
me
a
peculiar
impression
she
seemed
to
be
unhappy
there
was
a
kind
of
troubled
note
in
what
she
said
i
had
felt
uncomfortable
about
meeting
her
you
can
imagine
after
my
study
of
tammany
and
the
traction
trust
jack
did
she
mention
that
julia
no
she
never
has
but
i
several
times
had
the
feeling
that
she
was
trying
to
get
up
the
courage
to
do
it
i
thought
somehow
that
she
must
be
suffering
about
her
father
jack
my
god
would
it
be
a
joke
if
nemesis
were
to
get
at
jim
hegan
through
his
daughter
julia
yes
would
it
jack
how
do
you
suppose
he
takes
her
reform
activities
julia
i
do
know
but
i
fancy
they
must
have
had
it
out
she
not
the
sort
of
person
to
let
herself
be
turned
back
when
her
mind
made
up
jack
a
sort
of
chip
of
the
old
block
after
a
pause
if
i
known
what
was
up
i
would
have
suggested
asking
anybody
else
to
julia
oh
that
all
right
it
wo
make
any
difference
jack
this
chap
montague
that
i
to
you
about
he
a
sort
of
a
convert
of
my
own
julia
i
see
we
reciprocate
jack
i
think
i
got
montague
pretty
well
landed
you
be
interested
in
him
it
quite
a
story
it
was
last
election
day
the
bell
rings
julia
ah
there
somebody
she
goes
to
the
door
calls
is
that
you
miss
hegan
laura
off
yes
it
julia
you
found
your
way
did
you
laura
oh
no
trouble
at
all
enters
a
tall
stately
girl
about
simply
but
elegantly
clad
how
do
you
do
julia
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
jack
this
is
miss
hegan
bullen
laura
how
do
you
do
bullen
jack
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
miss
hegan
julia
let
me
take
your
things
laura
looking
about
oh
what
a
cozy
place
i
think
these
model
tenements
are
delightful
julia
they
indispensable
to
us
agitators
an
oasis
in
a
desert
jack
built
for
the
proletariat
and
inhabited
by
cranks
laura
is
that
the
truth
julia
it
certainly
the
truth
about
this
one
below
me
are
two
painters
and
a
settlement
worker
and
next
door
is
a
blind
anarchist
and
a
yiddish
poet
laura
what
the
reason
for
it
julia
going
to
room
off
left
with
laura
things
the
places
are
clean
and
cheap
and
whenever
the
poor
ca
pay
their
rent
we
take
their
homes
jack
the
elimination
of
the
unfit
laura
it
sounds
like
a
tragic
explanation
but
i
guess
it
true
looking
at
jack
and
so
this
is
bullen
for
such
a
famous
revolutionist
i
expected
to
find
some
one
more
julia
returning
do
make
up
your
mind
too
soon
about
jack
liable
to
startle
you
laura
i
not
easily
startled
any
more
i
getting
quite
used
to
meeting
revolutionists
jack
you
do
call
them
revolutionists
that
you
meet
at
the
settlement
i
hope
laura
no
but
all
sorts
of
people
come
there
julia
by
the
way
jack
me
this
afternoon
and
said
he
invited
a
friend
here
i
hope
you
do
mind
laura
why
no
not
at
all
is
it
one
of
your
russian
friends
jack
oh
no
he
an
american
his
name
is
montague
i
was
just
starting
to
tell
julia
about
him
when
you
came
in
laura
go
ahead
jack
it
was
quite
an
adventure
i
do
know
that
i
ever
had
one
that
was
more
exciting
and
i
had
quite
some
you
know
laura
yes
i
been
told
so
jack
it
was
last
election
day
in
a
polling
place
on
the
bowery
i
was
a
watcher
for
the
socialists
and
this
montague
was
one
of
the
watchers
for
the
reform
crowd
the
other
one
was
drunk
and
so
he
had
the
work
all
to
himself
it
was
in
the
heart
of
leary
district
and
the
crowd
there
was
a
tough
one
i
can
tell
you
it
was
a
close
election
laura
yes
i
know
jack
there
been
all
kinds
of
going
on
and
the
box
was
full
of
marked
and
defective
ballots
and
montague
set
to
work
to
make
them
throw
them
out
i
did
pay
much
attention
at
first
i
was
only
there
to
see
that
our
own
ballots
were
counted
but
pretty
soon
i
began
to
take
interest
he
had
every
one
in
the
place
against
him
there
was
a
tammany
inspector
of
elections
and
four
tally
clerks
all
in
with
tammany
of
course
there
were
three
or
four
tammany
policemen
and
outside
of
the
railing
the
worst
crowd
of
toughs
that
ever
you
laid
eyes
on
to
make
matters
worse
there
were
several
men
inside
who
had
no
business
to
be
there
one
of
them
a
judge
of
the
city
court
and
another
a
state
attorney
and
all
of
them
storming
at
montague
julia
what
did
he
do
jack
he
just
made
them
throw
out
the
marked
ballots
they
were
willing
enough
to
put
them
to
one
side
but
wanted
to
count
them
in
on
the
tally
sheets
and
of
course
montague
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
they
ever
counted
them
in
they
close
up
at
the
end
and
that
would
be
all
there
was
to
it
he
had
the
law
with
him
of
course
he
a
lawyer
himself
and
he
seemed
to
know
it
all
by
heart
and
he
quote
it
to
them
paragraph
by
paragraph
and
they
look
it
up
and
find
that
he
was
right
and
of
course
that
only
made
them
madder
the
old
judge
would
start
up
in
his
seat
officer
he
shout
he
was
a
ignorant
fellow
a
typical
barroom
politician
i
demand
that
you
put
that
man
out
of
here
and
the
cop
actually
laid
his
hand
on
shoulder
if
he
ever
been
landed
on
the
other
side
of
that
railing
the
crowd
would
have
torn
him
to
pieces
but
the
man
stayed
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
officer
he
said
you
are
aware
that
i
am
an
election
official
here
under
the
protection
of
the
law
and
if
you
refuse
me
that
protection
you
are
liable
to
a
sentence
in
state
prison
then
he
quote
another
paragraph
julia
it
a
wonder
he
ever
held
them
jack
he
did
it
he
made
them
throw
out
ballots
and
of
them
were
tammany
ballots
too
there
was
one
time
when
i
thought
the
gang
was
going
to
break
loose
and
i
sneaked
out
and
telephoned
for
help
then
i
came
back
and
spoke
up
for
him
i
wanted
them
to
know
there
be
one
witness
you
should
have
seen
the
grateful
look
that
montague
gave
me
laura
i
can
imagine
it
julia
and
how
did
it
end
jack
why
you
see
we
kept
them
there
till
eleven
at
night
and
by
that
time
everybody
knew
that
tammany
had
won
and
the
ballots
were
not
needed
so
the
old
judge
patted
us
on
the
back
and
told
us
we
were
heroes
and
invited
us
out
to
get
drunk
with
him
montague
and
i
walked
home
together
through
the
election
din
and
got
acquainted
i
do
know
that
i
ever
met
a
man
i
took
to
more
quickly
laura
you
are
making
a
socialist
out
of
him
of
course
jack
oh
he
coming
on
but
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
to
take
his
ideas
from
any
one
else
he
wants
to
see
for
himself
he
been
in
new
york
long
you
know
he
comes
from
the
south
from
mississippi
laura
startled
from
mississippi
what
his
first
name
jack
allan
laura
betraying
emotion
allan
montague
jack
do
you
know
him
laura
yes
i
know
him
very
well
indeed
oh
i
did
that
is
i
have
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
recovering
her
poise
is
he
surely
coming
jack
he
generally
keeps
his
engagements
julia
how
did
you
come
to
know
him
laura
he
ollie
montague
brother
jack
who
ollie
montague
laura
he
one
of
those
pretty
boys
that
everybody
knows
in
society
he
brought
his
brother
up
from
the
south
to
introduce
him
he
was
in
some
business
deal
or
other
with
my
father
then
he
seemed
to
drop
out
of
everything
and
nobody
sees
him
any
more
i
do
know
why
jack
i
think
he
was
disgusted
with
his
experiences
laura
oh
jack
realizing
that
he
had
said
something
awkward
i
think
i
was
the
first
socialist
he
ever
met
he
had
just
gotten
to
the
stage
of
despair
he
started
out
with
a
long
program
of
reforms
and
he
was
going
to
educate
the
people
to
them
one
by
one
until
he
made
them
all
effective
i
said
to
him
by
the
time
you
got
the
attention
of
the
public
on
reform
number
thirty
what
do
you
suppose
the
politicians
will
have
been
doing
with
reform
number
one
julia
we
all
have
to
go
through
that
stage
i
can
remember
just
as
well
a
ring
upon
the
bell
ah
there
he
is
jack
rises
and
goes
to
the
door
but
i
think
he
most
through
butting
his
head
against
the
stone
wall
calls
are
you
there
old
man
montague
off
i
here
jack
how
are
you
montague
fine
jack
come
right
in
montague
enters
a
tall
handsome
man
of
thirty
and
slow
of
speech
the
dark
type
of
a
southerner
i
a
trifle
late
sees
laura
starts
miss
hegan
you
recovers
himself
why
an
unexpected
pleasure
laura
unexpected

glad

no
idea
we
were
bringing
old
friends
together
montague
no
it
was
certainly
a
coincidence
laura
it
been
let
me
see
a
year
since
we
met
montague
it
must
be
fully
that
laura
where
do
you
keep
yourself
these
days
montague
oh
i
studying
in
a
quiet
way
laura
and
none
of
your
old
friends
ever
see
you
montague
i
do
get
about
much
laura
earnestly
and
friendship
means
so
little
to
you
as
that
montague
i
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
i
have
been
busy
with
politics
a
pause
of
embarrassment
julia
bullen
has
just
been
telling
us
about
your
heroism
montague
my
heroism
where
julia
at
the
polling
place
montague
oh
that
it
was
nothing
laura
it
seemed
like
a
good
deal
to
us
montague
make
him
tell
you
about
some
of
his
own
adventures
julia
would
you
ever
think
to
look
at
his
innocent
countenance
that
he
had
helped
to
hold
a
building
for
six
hours
against
russian
artillery
laura
good
heavens
where
was
this
julia
during
the
petersburg
uprising
laura
and
were
you
frightened
to
death
jack
laughing
no
we
were
too
busy
taking
at
the
cossacks
it
was
like
the
hunting
season
in
the
adirondacks
laura
and
how
did
it
turn
out
jack
oh
they
were
too
much
for
us
in
the
end
i
got
away
across
the
ice
of
the
neva
i
had
the
heel
of
one
shoe
shot
off
and
yet
people
tell
us
romance
is
dead
anybody
who
is
looking
for
romance
and
knows
what
it
is
can
find
all
he
wants
in
russia
pause
laura
to
montague
have
you
seen
my
father
lately
montague
no
not
for
some
time
laura
you
may
see
him
this
evening
he
promised
to
call
for
me
montague
indeed
jack
oh
by
the
way
julia
i
forgot
how
annie
laura
oh
yes
how
is
she
julia
she
doing
well
i
think
better
every
day
laura
is
she
still
violent
julia
not
so
much
i
can
always
handle
her
now
laura
is
she
in
the
next
room
looking
to
the
right
julia
yes
she
been
asleep
since
afternoon
laura
and
you
still
wo
let
me
send
her
to
a
hospital
julia
oh
no
truly
it
would
kill
the
poor
girl
laura
but
you
with
all
your
work
and
your
engagements
julia
she
very
quiet
and
the
neighbors
come
in
and
help
when
out
they
all
sympathize
laura
talking
about
heroism
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
entitled
to
mention
julia
why
nonsense
the
girl
was
simply
thrown
into
my
arms
laura
most
people
would
have
managed
to
step
out
of
the
way
just
the
same
you
heard
the
story
have
you
montague
montague
bullen
has
told
it
to
me
you
have
been
able
to
get
any
justice
jack
from
the
police
hardly
but
we
keeping
at
it
to
make
the
story
complete
i
went
to
see
captain
quinn
what
this
says
he
annie
rogers
again
did
your
lady
frien
get
her
pitcher
in
the
papers
over
that
case
an
what
more
does
she
want
julia
i
went
this
afternoon
to
see
the
tammany
leader
of
our
district
montague
leary
julia
the
same
i
went
straight
into
his
saloon
lady
says
he
the
goil
nutty
you
got
a
bughouse
patient
on
your
bands
this
here
talk
about
the
traffic
it
all
the
work
o
these
magazine
muckrakers
meaning
myself
mr
leary
said
i
and
he
looked
kind
of
puzzled
i
do
think
he
knew
who
i
was
montague
all
the
work
of
the
muckrakers
i
see
boss
grimes
is
out
to
that
effect
also
jack
and
i
see
that
half
a
dozen
clergymen
sat
down
to
a
public
banquet
with
him
the
other
day
that
what
we
come
to
in
new
york
bob
grimes
with
his
hands
on
every
string
of
the
whole
infamous
system
with
his
paws
in
every
filthy
in
the
city
bob
grimes
the
type
and
symbol
of
it
all
every
time
i
see
a
picture
of
that
bulldog
face
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
were
confronting
all
the
horrors
that
ever
fought
in
my
life
julia
it
curious
to
note
how
much
less
denunciation
of
tammany
one
hears
now
than
in
the
old
days
montague
tammany
getting
respectable
jack
the
big
interests
have
found
out
how
to
use
it
the
traction
gang
especially
he
stops
abruptly
a
tense
pause
laura
leaning
toward
him
with
great
earnestness
bullen
is
that
really
true
jack
that
is
true
miss
hegan
laura
bullen
you
will
understand
what
it
means
to
me
to
hear
that
statement
made
i
hear
it
made
continually
and
i
ask
if
it
is
true
and
i
am
told
that
it
is
a
slander
how
am
i
to
know
a
pause
would
you
be
able
to
tell
me
that
you
know
it
of
your
own
personal
knowledge
jack
weighing
the
words
no
i
could
not
say
that
laura
would
you
say
that
you
could
prove
it
to
a
jury
jack
i
would
say
that
if
i
had
to
prove
it
i
could
get
the
evidence
laura
what
would
you
say
montague
montague
i
would
rather
not
say
miss
hegan
laura
please
please
i
want
you
to
answer
me
montague
after
a
pause
i
would
say
that
i
shall
be
able
to
prove
it
very
shortly
laura
how
do
you
mean
montague
i
have
been
giving
most
of
my
time
to
a
study
of
just
that
question
and
i
think
that
i
shall
have
the
evidence
laura
i
see
she
sinks
back
very
white
a
pause
the
bell
rings
julia
who
can
that
be
jack
springing
up
let
me
answer
it
presses
button
then
to
montague
i
had
no
idea
you
were
going
in
for
that
old
man
montague
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
mentioned
it
to
any
one
julia
rising
hoping
to
relieve
an
embarrassing
situation
i
hope
this
is
any
more
company
jack
to
montague
aside
you
must
let
me
tell
you
a
few
things
that
i
know
i
been
running
down
a
little
story
about
grimes
and
the
traction
crowd
montague
indeed
what
is
it
jack
i
ca
tell
it
to
you
now
it
would
take
too
long
but
gee
if
i
can
get
the
evidence
it
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
it
has
to
do
with
the
grand
avenue
railroad
suit
montague
the
one
that
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
jack
yes
you
see
jim
hegan
stands
to
lose
a
fortune
by
it
and
reason
to
believe
that
there
some
being
done
with
the
court
it
happens
that
one
of
the
judges
has
a
nephew
a
dissipated
chap
who
hates
him
he
an
old
college
friend
of
mine
and
he
trying
to
get
some
evidence
for
me
montague

oh
what

is

off
sobbing
julia
it
will
be
all
right
dear
exit
a
pause
hegan
what
does
this
mean
jack
promptly
and
ruthlessly
it
means
that
you
have
been
seeing
the
traffic
in
action
hegan
i
do
understand
jack
quietly
but
with
suppressed
passion
tens
of
thousands
of
girl
slaves
are
needed
for
the
markets
of
our
great
cities
for
the
lumber
camps
of
the
north
the
mining
camps
of
the
west
the
ditches
of
panama
and
every
four
or
five
years
the
supply
must
be
renewed
and
so
the
business
of
gathering
these
from
our
slums
is
one
of
the
great
industries
of
the
city
this
girl
annie
rogers
a
decent
girl
from
the
north
of
ireland
was
lured
into
a
dance
hall
and
drugged
and
then
taken
to
a
brothel
and
locked
in
a
room
they
took
her
clothing
away
from
her
but
she
broke
down
her
door
at
night
and
fled
to
the
street
in
her
wrapper
and
flung
herself
into
miss
patterson
arms
two
men
were
pursuing
her
they
tried
to
carry
her
off
miss
patterson
called
a
policeman
but
he
said
the
girl
was
insane
only
by
making
a
disturbance
and
drawing
a
crowd
was
my
friend
able
to
save
her
and
now
we
have
been
the
rounds
from
the
sergeant
at
the
station
and
the
police
captain
to
the
chief
of
police
and
the
mayor
himself
we
have
been
to
the
tammany
leader
of
the
district
the
real
boss
of
the
neighborhood
and
there
is
no
justice
to
be
had
anywhere
for
annie
rogers
hegan
impossible
jack
you
have
my
word
for
it
sir
and
the
reason
for
it
is
that
this
hideous
traffic
is
one
of
the
main
cogs
in
our
political
machine
the
pimps
and
the
panders
the
cadets
and
maquereaux
they
vote
the
ticket
of
the
organization
they
contribute
to
the
campaign
funds
they
serve
as
colonizers
and
repeaters
at
the
polls
the
tribute
that
they
pay
amounts
to
millions
and
it
is
shared
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
in
the
organization
from
the
ward
man
on
the
street
and
the
police
captain
up
to
the
inner
circle
of
the
chiefs
of
tammany
hall
yes
even
to
your
friend
robert
grimes
himself
a
thousand
times
sir
has
the
truth
about
this
monstrous
infamy
been
put
before
the
people
of
your
city
and
that
they
have
not
long
ago
risen
in
their
wrath
and
driven
its
agents
from
their
midst
is
due
to
but
one
single
fact
that
this
infamous
organization
of
crime
and
graft
is
backed
at
each
election
time
by
the
millions
of
the
great
public
service
corporations
it
is
they
montague
interfering
bullen
jack
let
me
go
on
it
is
they
sir
who
finance
the
thugs
and
repeaters
who
desecrate
our
polls
it
is
they
who
suborn
our
press
and
blind
the
eyes
of
our
people
it
is
they
who
are
responsible
for
this
traffic
in
the
flesh
of
our
women
it
is
they
who
have
to
answer
for
the
tottering
reason
of
that
poor
peasant
girl
in
the
next
room
laura
has
been
listening
to
this
speech
white
with
horror
as
the
indictment
proceeds
she
covers
her
face
with
her
hands
at
this
point
she
breaks
into
uncontrollable
weeping

centre

hegan

so
good
of
you

i

glad

here
laura
i
just
had
a
telephone
call
from
bullen
montague
starting
from
bullen
laura
yes
he
said
he
had
to
see
you
about
something
montague
eagerly
where

he
laura
he
was
at
his
brother
place

told
him

montague
oh
is
he
coming
laura
yes
he

montague
thank

very
much
laura
he
said
it
was
something
quite
urgent
montague
yes
he
has
some
important
papers
for
me
laura
i
see
he
made
a
speech
last
night
that
stirred
up
the
press
montague
smiling
yes
laura
he
is
surely
a
tireless
fighter
montague
it
such
men
as
bullen
who
keep
the
world
moving
laura
and
do
you
agree
with
him
montague
montague
in
what
way
laura
that
the
end
of
it
all
is
to
be
a
revolution
montague
i
do
know
miss
hegan
i
find
i
am
moving
that
way
i
used
to
think
we
could
control
capital
now
i
am
beginning
to
suspect
that
it
is
in
the
nature
of
capital
to
have
its
way
and
that
if
the
people
wish
to
rule
they
must
own
the
capital
laura
after
a
pause
montague
i
had
to
ask
you
to
come
out
and
see
me
because
i
promised
my
father
i
would
not
go
into
the
city
again
for
a
while
i
not
been
altogether
well
since
that
evening
at
julia
montague
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
miss
hegan
laura
it
nothing
but
it
worries
my
father
you
know
pause
i
thought
we
should
be
alone
this
afternoon
but
i
find
that
my
father
is
coming
and
and
baker
is
coming
also
so
i
may
have
time
to
say
all
i
wished
to
say
to
you
but
i
must
thank
you
for
coming
montague
i
was
very
glad
to
come
miss
hegan
laura
i
can
appreciate
your
embarrassment
at
being
asked
to
montague
no
laura
we
must
deal
frankly
with
each
other
i
know
that
you
did
not
want
to
come
i
know
that
you
have
tried
to
put
an
end
to
our
friendship
montague
hesitates
miss
hegan
let
me
explain
my
position
laura
i
think
i
understand
it
already
you
have
found
evil
conditions
which
you
wish
to
oppose
and
you
were
afraid
that
our
friendship
might
stand
in
the
way
montague
in
a
low
voice
miss
hegan
i
came
to
new
york
an
entire
stranger
two
years
ago
and
my
brother
introduced
me
to
his
rich
friends
by
one
of
them
i
was
asked
to
take
charge
of
a
law
case
it
was
a
case
of
very
great
importance
which
served
to
give
me
an
opening
into
the
inner
life
of
the
city
i
discovered
that
in
their
blind
struggle
for
power
our
great
capitalists
had
lost
all
sense
of
the
difference
between
honesty
and
crime
i
found
that
trust
funds
were
being
abused
that
courts
and
legislatures
were
being
corrupted
the
very
financial
stability
of
the
country
was
being
wrecked
the
thing
shocked
me
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
and
i
set
to
work
to
give
the
public
some
light
on
the
situation
then
what
happened
miss
hegan
my
newly
made
rich
friends
cut
me
a
deal
they
began
to
circulate
vile
slanders
about
me
they
insulted
me
openly
on
more
than
one
occasion
so
do
you
see
laura
yes
i
see
but
could
you
not
have
trusted
a
friendship
such
as
ours
montague
i
did
not
dare
laura
you
saw
that
you
had
to
fight
my
father
and
you
thought
that
i
would
blindly
take
his
side
montague
hesitating
i
i
could
suppose
laura
listen
you
have
told
me
your
situation
now
imagine
mine
imagine
a
girl
brought
up
in
luxury
with
a
father
whom
she
loves
very
dearly
and
who
loves
her
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
everything
is
done
to
make
her
happy
to
keep
her
contented
and
peaceful
but
as
she
grows
up
she
reads
and
listens
and
little
by
little
it
dawns
upon
her
that
her
father
is
one
of
the
leaders
in
this
terrible
struggle
that
you
have
spoken
of
she
hears
about
wrongdoing
she
is
told
that
her
father
enemies
have
slandered
him
at
first
perhaps
she
believes
that
but
time
goes
on
she
sees
suffering
and
oppression
she
begins
to
realize
a
little
of
cause
and
effect
she
wants
to
help
she
wants
to
do
right
but
there
is
no
way
for
her
to
know
she
goes
to
one
person
after
another
and
no
one
will
deal
frankly
with
her
no
one
will
tell
her
the
truth
absolutely
no
one
leaning
forward
with
intensity
no
one
no
one
montague
i
see
laura
so
it
was
with
you
and
with
our
friendship
i
knew
that
you
had
broken
it
off
for
such
reasons
i
knew
that
there
was
nothing
personal
it
was
nothing
that
i
had
done
montague
no
surely
not
laura
gazes
about
nervously
and
then
the
other
night
you
told
me
you
were
investigating
the
traction
companies
of
new
their
connection
with
politics
and
so
on
ever
since
then
i
have
felt
that
you
were
the
one
person
i
must
talk
with
do
you
see
montague
yes
i
see
laura
i
have
sought
for
some
one
who
will
tell
me
the
truth
will
you
montague
in
a
low
voice
you
must
realize
what
you
are
asking
of
me
miss
hegan
laura
i
have
not
brought
you
here
without
realizing
that
you
must
help
me
montague
very
well
i
will
do
what
i
can
laura
leaning
forward
i
wish
to
know
about
my
father
i
wish
to
know
to
what
extent
he
is
involved
in
these
evils
that
you
speak
of
montague
your
father
is
in
the
game
and
he
has
played
it
the
way
the
game
is
played
laura
has
he
been
better
than
the
others
or
worse
montague
about
the
same
miss
hegan
laura
he
has
been
more
successful
than
they
montague
he
has
been
very
successful
laura
you
were
concerned
in
some
important
deal
with
my
father
were
you
not
montague
i
was
laura
then
you
withdrew
was
that
because
there
was
something
wrong
in
it
montague
it
was
miss
hegan
laura
there
were
corrupt
things
done
montague
there
were
many
kinds
of
corrupt
things
done
laura
and
was
my
father
responsible
for
them
montague
yes
laura
directly
montague
yes
directly
laura
then
my
father
is
a
bad
man
montague
after
a
pause
your
father
finds
himself
in
the
midst
of
an
evil
system
he
is
the
victim
of
conditions
which
he
did
not
create
laura
ah
now
you
are
trying
to
spare
me
montague
no
i
should
say
that
to
any
one
i
am
at
war
with
the
system
not
with
individuals
it
is
the
old
story
of
hating
the
sin
and
loving
the
sinner
your
father
rivals
are
just
as
reckless
as
he
take
murdock
for
instance
the
man
who
is
behind
this
grand
avenue
railroad
matter
it
is
hard
for
a
woman
to
understand
that
situation
laura
i
can
understand
some
things
very
clearly
i
go
down
into
the
slums
and
i
see
all
that
welter
of
misery
i
see
the
forces
of
evil
that
exist
there
defiant
and
hateful
the
saloons
and
the
and
that
ghastly
traffic
of
which
annie
rogers
is
the
victim
and
there
is
the
political
organization
taking
its
toll
from
all
these
and
using
it
to
keep
itself
in
power
and
there
is
boss
grimes
who
is
at
the
head
of
all
and
he
is
one
of
my
intimate
associates
i
ask
about
it
and
i
am
told
that
it
is
a
matter
of
business
but
why
should
my
father
do
business
with
a
man
whose
chief
source
of
income
is
vice
montague
that
is
not
quite
the
case
miss
hegan
laura
does
the
vice
tribute
go
to
him
montague
part
of
it
does
i
have
no
doubt
but
it
would
be
a
very
small
part
of
his
income
laura
what
then
montague
the
vice
graft
serves
for
the
police
and
the
district
leaders
and
the
little
men
what
really
pays
nowadays
is
what
has
come
to
be
called
honest
graft
laura
what
is
that
montague
the
business
deals
that
are
trade
with
the
public
service
corporations
laura
ah
that
is
what
i
wish
to
know
about
montague
for
instance
i
am
running
a
street
railway
laura
quickly
my
father
is
running
them
all
montague
very
well
your
father
is
in
alliance
with
the
organization
he
is
given
franchises
and
public
privileges
for
practically
nothing
and
in
return
he
gives
the
contracts
for
constructing
the
subways
and
lines
to
companies
organized
by
the
politicians
these
companies
are
simply
paper
companies
they
farm
out
the
contracts
to
the
real
builders
skimming
off
a
profit
of
twenty
or
thirty
per
cent
one
of
these
companies
received
contracts
last
year
to
the
value
of
thirty
million
dollars
laura
and
so
that
is
how
grimes
gets
his
money
montague
grimes
brother
is
the
president
of
the
company
i
have
reference
to
laura
i
see
it
is
a
regular
system
montague
it
is
a
business
and
there
is
no
way
to
punish
it
it
does
not
violate
any
law
laura
and
yet
it
is
quite
as
bad
montague
it
is
far
worse
because
of
its
vast
scope
it
carries
every
form
of
corruption
in
its
train
it
means
the
prostitution
of
our
whole
system
of
government
the
subsidizing
of
our
newspapers
and
of
the
great
political
parties
it
means
that
judges
are
chosen
who
will
decide
in
favor
of
the
corporations
that
legislators
are
nominated
who
will
protect
them
against
attack
it
means
everywhere
the
enthronement
of
ignorance
and
incompetence
of
injustice
and
fraud
laura
and
in
the
end
the
public
pays
for
it
montague
in
the
end
the
public
pays
for
everything
the
stolen
franchises
are
unloaded
on
the
market
for
ten
times
what
they
cost
and
the
people
pay
their
nickels
for
a
wretched
service
they
pay
for
it
in
the
form
of
rent
and
taxes
for
a
dishonest
administration
every
struggling
unfortunate
in
the
city
pays
for
it
when
he
comes
into
contact
with
the
system
when
he
seeks
for
help
or
even
for
justice
it
was
that
side
of
it
that
shocked
me
most
of
all
i
being
a
lawyer
you
see
the
corrupting
of
our
courts
laura
the
judges
are
bought
montague
montague
the
judges
are
selected
miss
hegan
laura
selected
i
see
montague
and
that
system
prevails
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
down
to
the
petty
police
magistrates
before
whom
the
poor
come
to
plead
laura
and
that
is
why
the
traffic
goes
unpunished
montague
that
is
why
laura
and
why
no
one
would
move
a
hand
for
annie
rogers
montague
that
is
why
laura
and
my
father
is
responsible
for
it
montague
gravely
yes
i
think
he
is
miss
hegan
a
pause
laura
have
you
seen
julia
patterson
lately
montague
i
saw
her
last
night
laura
and
how
is
annie
montague
she
hesitates
she
is
dead
laura
starting
oh
montague
she
died
the
night
before
last
laura
stares
at
him
then
gives
a
wild
start
and
cries
she
she
montague
she
killed
herself
laura
oh
montague
she
cut
her
throat
laura
hides
her
face
and
sinks
against
the
table
shuddering
and
overcome

poor
girl
the
poor
poor
girl
suddenly
she
springs
up
ca

see
ca

things

are
driving
me
to
distraction
montague
starting
toward
her
miss
hegan
laura
covering
her
face
again
oh

is
horrible
i
ca
stand
it
i
sound
of

i
mean
to
know

for
her

hegan
my

these
evils
are
hard
to
know
of
laura
that
house
to
which
that
girl
was
taken
there
is
a
law
against
such
places
is
there

dear
laura
and
why

not
the

laura
but
why

for
judge
porter
do
you

what
a
place
for

to
meet
in
did
you

grimes

jack
god
i
give
one
hand
to
have

but
devilish
awkward
jack
why

i
tried
not
to
but
miss
hegan
insisted
jack
laughing
the
same
here
i
was
fair
caught
montague
and
now
she
think
we
learned
it
here
i
have
to
explain
to
her
jack
what
montague
i
must
jack
no
laura
appears
at
windows
centre
and
hears
the
rest
which
is
in
excited
tones
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
montague
but
i
ca
help
it
man
miss
hegan
will
think
i
been
eavesdropping
jack
do
you
realize
what
you
proposing
man
you
ruin
everything
we
got
grimes
dead
we
can
land
him
in
jail
but
if
hegan
heard
any
whisper
of
it
they
balk
everything
montague
but
how
jack
they
hold
up
the
decision
of
the
court
montague
nonsense
with
all
that
they
stand
to
lose
laura
coming
forward
i
beg
pardon
bullen
jack
oh
laura
i
did
wish
to
hear
what
you
were
saying
but
i
help
it
i
was
caught
unawares
the
three
stare
at
each
other
it
is
something
that
involves
my
father
looking
at
the
papers
in
hands
bullen
has
brought
you
some
evidence
is
that
so
montague
montague
in
a
low
voice
yes
miss
hegan
laura
and
you
wished
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
montague
i
wished
to
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
think
we
had
obtained
this
evidence
in
your
home
laura
i
see
montague
you
will
do
us
the
justice
to
recognize
that
we
did
not
seek
admission
here
laura
yes
i
do
that
a
pause
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
think
it
best
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
you
may
trust
me
to
the
bitter
end
montague
miss
hegan
bullen
has
brought
me
evidence
which
proves
that
the
decision
of
the
court
which
is
to
be
made
known
tomorrow
has
been
improperly
affected
laura
quickly
by
whom
montague
by
robert
grimes
laura
starts
wildly
and
the
evidence
involves
my
father
montague
your
father
will
be
the
chief
one
to
profit
from
the
change
laura
sinks
back
against
the
table
stares
away
from
them
whispering
to
grimes
two
hundred
thousand
on
court
deal
i
see
i
see
faces
them
weakly
and
what
what
do
you
mean
to
do
montague
i
intend
to
wait
until
the
decision
has
been
announced
which
will
be
tomorrow
and
then
to
call
a
public
meeting
and
present
the
evidence
laura
starts
to
implore
him
then
controls
herself
yes
yes
that
is
just
but
then
see
it
has
been
done
yet
montague
how
do
you
mean
laura
the
decision
has
come
out
it
could
be
stopped
jack
why
stop
it
laura
that
would
prevent
the
wrong
i
would
oh
i
see
you
want
to
expose
grimes
you
rather
it
happened
jack
the
crime
has
already
been
committed
laura
and
you
montague
you
prefer
it
so
montague
i
had
never
thought
of
any
other
possibility
laura
listen
i
do
understand
the
matter
very
clearly
the
grand
avenue
railroad
case
montague
it
is
an
effort
to
annul
a
franchise
which
was
obtained
by
proven
bribery
laura
then
if
the
public
could
win
it
would
be
worth
while
would
it
not
montague
it
would
establish
a
precedent
of
vast
importance
but
how
could
that
be
done
laura
we
have
a
hold
upon
these
men
we
could
compel
them
to
give
way
montague
they
would
never
do
it
miss
hegan
they
have
too
much
at
stake
laura
but
the
evidence
you
have
bullen
said
you
could
send
grimes
to
jail
montague
that
was
just
wild
talk
grimes
has
the
district
attorney
and
the
courts
he
could
never
be
punished
for
anything
laura
but
the
exposure
jack
he
been
exposed
a
hundred
times
what
does
that
matter
to
him
laura
but
then
my
father
is
involved
jack
quite
true
miss
hegan
laura
and
i
can
make
him
see
how
wrong
it
is
jack
you
can
make
him
see
it
but
you
ca
make
him
do
anything
laura
ah
but
you
do
know
my
father
truly
you
do
he
does
these
evil
things
but
at
heart
he
a
kind
and
loyal
man
and
he
loves
me
i
am
his
only
daughter
and
i
can
help
him
to
see
what
is
right
we
have
always
understood
each
other
he
will
listen
to
me
as
he
would
not
to
any
one
else
in
the
world
jack
but
what
can
you
say
to
him
we
ca
put
our
evidence
in
your
hands
laura
i
do
need
your
evidence
i
must
tell
you
that
i
too
have
found
out
something
about
this
case
i
know
that
my
father
paid
grimes
to
influence
the
decision
of
that
court
and
i
know
how
much
he
paid
him
montague
miss
hegan
jack
good
god
laura
you
see
i
am
not
afraid
to
trust
you
a
pause
what
is
the
nature
of
your
evidence
against
grimes
montague
it
comes
from
an
of
his
interview
with
the
judge
laura
and
it
is
some
one
you
can
trust
montague
it
for
bullen
to
tell
you
jack
the
judge
has
a
nephew
a
dissipated
chap
whose
inheritance
he
is
holding
back
and
who
hates
him
in
consequence
the
nephew
happens
to
be
a
college
chum
of
mine
he
witnessed
the
interview
and
he
brought
me
the
evidence
laura
i
see
then
certainly
i
have
a
case
and
do
you
see
what
a
hold
that
gives
me
upon
my
father
jack
miss
hegan
you
are
a
brave
woman
and
i
would
like
to
give
way
to
you
but
you
could
accomplish
nothing
this
suit
which
is
nominally
in
the
public
interest
is
really
backed
by
murdock
and
his
crowd
who
are
fighting
your
father
you
must
realize
his
the
thousand
ties
that
bind
him
all
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
think
of
the
friends
he
has
to
protect
you
do
know
laura
i
know
it
all
and
on
the
other

things
that
you
do
not

know
that
my

not
a
happy
man
there
is
a
canker
eating
at
his
heart
the
fruit
of
life

turned
to
ashes
on
his
lips
and
he
has
one
person
in
all
this
world
that
he
myself
he
has
toiled
and
fought
for
me
all
these
years
he
has
told
himself
that
he
was
making
his
money
for
me

he
finds
that
it
brings
me
only
misery
and
grief
it
is
as
useless
to
me
as
it
is
to
him

a
falsehood
hegan
laura
laura
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
have
to
say
it
it
was
a
falsehood
and
it
is
but
one
of
many
falsehoods
that
you
have
told
me
i
understand
just
why
you
did
it
you
think
i
ought
not
to
ask
about
these
things
because
it
will
make
me
unhappy
and
so
for
my
own
good
you
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
me
things
that
are
not
true
hegan
my
child
it
is
your
father
that
you
are
talking
to
laura
it
is
my
father
and
a
father
who
knows
that
i
love
him
very
dearly
and
who
will
realize
it
hurts
me
to
say
these
things
fully
as
much
as
it
hurts
him
to
hear
them
but
they
must
be
said
and
said
now
hegan
why
now
just
at
this
moment
laura
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
at
this
moment
you
are
very
busy
hegan
my
dear
the
exchange
will
open
in
an
hour
and
i
am
in
the
midst
of
a
big
campaign
i
have
important
orders
for
my
brokers
and
a
hundred
other
matters
to
attend
to
and
i
expect
grimes
here
any
minute
laura
grimes
hegan
yes
my
dear
laura
you
are
not
through
with
him
yet
then
hegan
no
laura
laura
well
even
so
grimes
must
wait
until
i
have
said
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
hegan
what
is
it
laura
laura
you
are
expecting
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
grand
avenue
railroad
case
at
noon
today
hegan
why
yes
laura
the
decision
will
be
in
your
favor
and
you
and
grimes
are
planning
to
gamble
on
it
and
to
make
a
great
deal
of
money
hegan
yes
my
dear
laura
and
you
paid
grimes
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
fix
the
decision
of
the
court
hegan
starting
violently
laura
laura
grimes
went
to
judge
porter
house
the
night
before
last
and
induced
him
to
change
his
vote
on
the
case
hegan
laura
laura
and
so
what
was
to
have
been
the
minority
opinion
of
the
court
is
to
be
given
out
today
as
the
court
decision
hegan
my
god
laura
you
do
not
deny
that
this
is
the
truth
hegan
you
overheard
us
at
the
house
laura
not
one
word
father
hegan
but
you
must
have
laura
father
throughout
this
conversation
you
may
honor
me
by
assuming
that
i
am
telling
you
the
absolute
truth
and
i
will
be
glad
when
you
will
give
me
the
same
privilege
hegan
then
how
did
you
learn
it
laura
that
unfortunately
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
hegan
then
other
people
know
it
laura
they
do
hegan
good
god
stares
at
her
dumbfounded
who
are
these
people
laura
i
can
not
tell
you
that
hegan
but
laura
you
must
laura
it
is
impossible
hegan
but
how
can
that
be
laura
i
can
not
discuss
the
matter
hegan
but
think
my
dear
i
am
your
father
and
you
must
trust
me
you
must
help
me
laura
please
do
not
ask
me
i
have
given
my
word
hegan
your
word
gazes
about
distracted
you
take
the
part
of
others
against
your
own
flesh
and
blood
laura
listen
father
think
of
me
for
a
minute
and
how
it
seems
to
me
do
not
be
so
ignoble
as
to
think
only
of
the
exposure
hegan
but
my
child
realize
what
it
will
mean
if
this
comes
out
are
these
people
among
my
enemies
laura
that
depends
upon
circumstances
hegan
i
do
understand
you
laura
i
will
try
to
explain
if
you
will
be
patient
with
me
hegan
go
on
go
on
laura
father
you
know
what
has
been
happening
to
me
during
the
past
few
months
you
know
how
unhappy
i
have
been
and
now
you
have
committed
a
crime
a
dreadful
dreadful
crime
hegan
my
dear
laura
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
to
you
i
am
in
desperate
earnest
i
have
taken
all
night
to
think
it
over
and
i
am
not
making
any
mistake
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
come
what
will
and
cost
what
it
may
i
must
clear
myself
of
the
responsibility
for
these
evils
hegan
in
what
way
are
you
responsible
laura
in
every
way
imaginable
my
whole
life
is
based
upon
them
everything
that
i
have
and
enjoy
is
stained
with
the
guilt
of
them
the
house
in
which
i
live
the
clothing
that
i
wear
the
food
that
i
eat
and
i
shall
never
again
know
what
it
is
to
be
happy
while
i
have
that
fact
upon
my
conscience
do
you
see
hegan
i
see
laura
i
tried
all
night
to
find
you
i
wanted
to
have
a
chance
to
talk
with
you
quietly
and
now
instead
i
have
to
do
it
here
amid
all
the
rush
and
strain
of
this
dreadful
wall
street
but
so
it
i
must
say
it
here
father
i
have
come
to
plead
with
you
to
plead
with
you
upon
my
knees
listen
to
me
do
turn
me
away
hegan
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
laura
first
of
all
i
wish
you
to
give
up
this
illegal
advantage
that
you
have
gained
i
wish
you
to
stop
this
decision
and
give
the
people
the
victory
to
which
they
are
entitled
hegan
but
my
dear
that
is
madness
how
can
i
laura
you
compelled
grimes
to
do
this
thing
you
can
compel
him
to
undo
it
hegan
but
my
dear
it
would
ruin
me
laura
if
you
do
what
i
ask
you
to
do
ruin
will
not
matter
hegan
what
do
you
ask
me
laura
i
wish
you
to
stop
this
mad
career
to
give
up
this
money
game
to
drop
it
utterly
to
stop
selling
stocks
and
manipulating
markets
to
stop
buying
politicians
and
franchises
to
sell
out
everything
to
withdraw
i
want
you
to
do
it
now
this
very
hour
hegan
but
my
dear
laura
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
and
help
me
to
find
happiness
again
by
doing
some
good
in
the
world
i
want
you
to
use
your
power
and
your
talents
to
help
people
instead
of
to
destroy
them
hegan
my
child
that
is
something
very
easy
to
talk
about
but
not
so
easy
to
do
laura
we
will
work
together
and
find
ways
to
do
it
hegan
it
seems
possible
from
your
point
of
view
with
your
noble
ideals
and
your
sheltered
life
laura
my
sheltered
life
that
is
just
what
i
can
no
longer
endure
that
i
should
have
ease
and
comfort
while
others
suffer
that
my
father
should
take
part
in
this
mad
struggle
for
money
and
power
in
order
to
give
me
a
sheltered
life
i
must
make
it
impossible
for
that
to
continue
i
must
make
you
understand
that
all
your
money
is
powerless
to
bring
me
happiness
that
it
is
poisoning
my
life
as
well
as
your
own
hegan
gravely
laura
i
have
tried
to
protect
you
that
is
the
natural
instinct
of
a
father
to
keep
evil
things
from
his
knowledge
if
i
have
told
you
untruths
as
you
say
that
has
been
the
one
reason
but
since
you
will
not
have
it
so
since
you
must
face
the
facts
of
the
world
laura
i
must
hegan
very
well
then
you
shall
face
them
you
tell
me
to
give
up
this
case
to
change
back
the
court
decision
so
that
the
public
may
reap
the
advantage
do
you
realize
that
the
public
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
suit
that
it
is
a
covert
attack
upon
me
by
an
unscrupulous
enemy
laura
you
mean
murdock
hegan
murdock
you
know
something
of
his
career
perhaps
something
of
his
private
life
too
and
if
i
should
turn
back
as
you
ask
the
public
would
gain
nothing
he
would
be
the
only
one
to
profit
he
would
raid
my
securities
he
would
throw
my
companies
into
bankruptcy
he
would
draw
my
associates
away
from
me
in
the
end
he
would
take
my
place
in
the
traction
field
is
that
what
you
wish
to
bring
about
laura
it
is
not
that
that
i
am
thinking
of
it
is
the
corrupting
of
the
court
hegan
the
court
do
you
know
why
grimes
and
i
had
to
do
what
we
did
laura
no
hegan
and
yet
you
have
judged
me
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
we
had
information
that
one
of
the
judges
had
received
a
thousand
shares
of
grand
avenue
stock
from
murdock
and
that
another
had
been
promised
a
seat
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
by
that
eminent
republican
laura
oh
horrible
hegan
you
see
what
the
game
is

selling
of
the

while

have
been
like
a
man
surrounded
by
a
pack
of
wolves
i
defended
myself
as
i
could
in
the
end
i
found
that
the
best
way
to
defend
was
by
attacking
in
other
words
i
had
to
go
into
politics
to
make
the
control
of
the
government
a
part
of
my
business
do
you
see
laura

way

brand
upon

evils
and
to
take
up
a
new
way

and
crushed

staring
at

she
is
not
at
liberty
to
give
the
names
grimes
well
i
be
damned
he
stares
from
hegan
to
laura
then
comes
and
sits
very
deliberately
where
he
can
gaze
at
them
a
long
pause
then
nodding
toward
them
what
her
game
hegan
weakly
she
will
tell
you
grimes
looking
at
her
well
laura
i
am
here
to
plead
with
my
father
to
turn
back
from
this
wickedness
grimes
stares
and
do
what
laura
quit
wall
street
and
devote
himself
to
some
useful
work
grimes
after
a
pause
and
if
he
wo
laura
i
have
told
him
he
must
choose
between
his
present
career
and
his
daughter
love
grimes
gazes
at
laura
then
in
front
of
him
slowly
shakes
his
head
i
ca
make
out
our
young
people
when
i
was
a
boy
young
women
looked
up
to
their
parents
what
your
father
done
to
you
that
you
should
turn
against
him
laura
i
have
not
turned
against
him
grimes
grimes
indicating
hegan
who
sits
in
an
attitude
of
despair
look
at
him
a
pause
laura
i
am
pleading
with
him
for
his
own
good
to
give
up
this
cruel
struggle
grimes
to
turn
tail
and
run
from
his
enemies
laura
it
is
of
my
duty
to
the
public
that
i
am
thinking
grimes
grimes
you
owe
no
duty
to
this
world
higher
than
your
duty
to
your
father
laura
you
think
that
grimes
i
think
it
laura
hesitates
a
moment
then
turns
father
what
do
you
say
is
that
true
hegan
crushed
i
do
know
my
dear
grimes
god
almighty
and
this
is
jim
hegan
to
laura
where
you
get
onto
these
ideas
laura
in
a
low
voice
i
think
grimes
it
might
be
best
if
you
did
not
ask
me
to
discuss
this
question
our
points
of
view
are
too
different
grimes
shrugs
his
shoulders
as
you
please
but
you
mind
me
i
ai
easy
to
offend
and
i
only
trying
to
understand
you
laura
after
a
silence
grimes
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
brought
up
in
a
beautiful
and
luxurious
home
but
not
long
ago
i
began
to
go
down
into
the
slums
and
see
the
homes
of
the
people
i
saw
sights
that
made
me
sick
with
horror
grimes
no
doubt
laura
i
found
the
people
in
the
grip
of
a
predatory
organization
that
had
bound
them
hand
and
foot
and
was
devouring
them
alive
grimes
you
been
listening
to
tales
we
do
a
lot
for
the
people
laura
you
treat
them
to
free
coal
and
free
picnics
and
free
beer
and
so
you
get
their
votes
and
then
you
sell
them
out
to
capitalists
like
my
father
grimes
humph
laura
you
sell
them
out
to
any
one
high
or
low
who
will
pay
for
the
privilege
of
exploiting
them
you
sell
them
to
the
and
the
and
the
gambler
you
sell
them
to
the
trader
grimes
there
no
such
person
miss
hegan
laura
you
offer
an
insult
to
my
intelligence
grimes
i
have
met
with
him
and
his
work
there
was
a
girl
of
the
slums
her
name
was
annie
rogers
she
was
a
decent
girl
and
she
was
lured
into
a
dive
and
drugged
and
shut
up
in
a
brothel
a
prisoner
she
escaped
to
the
street
pursued
and
a
friend
of
mine
saved
her
and
high
and
low
among
the
authorities
of
this
city
we
sought
for
justice
for
that
girl
and
there
was
no
justice
to
be
had
yesterday
afternoon
i
learned
that
she
cut
her
own
throat
grimes
i
see
laura
and
that
happened
grimes
it
happened
in
the
city
of
new
york
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
grimes
such
things
have
been
laura
and
you
permit
them
grimes
i
laura
you
permit
them
grimes
i
ca
attempt
to
discuss
prostitution
with
a
lady
such
things
existed
long
before
i
was
born
laura
you
could
use
your
power
to
drive
the
traffic
from
the
city
grimes
yes
i
suppose
i
could
but
if
i
been
that
sort
of
a
man
do
you
think
i
ever
had
the
power
laura
how
neatly
parried
what
sort
of
a
man
are
you
anyway
grimes
looks
at
hey
fixedly
i
tell
you
the
sort
of
man
i
am
a
pause
i
was
brought
up
in
a
beautiful
luxurious
home
i
was
brought
up
with
five
brothers
in
two
rooms
on
the
top
floor
of
a
rear
tenement
on
avenue
b
i
was
a
little
street
mick
and
then
i
was
a
prize
scrapper
and
the
leader
of
a
gang
when
a
policeman
chased
me
upstairs
my
mother
stood
at
the
head
and
fought
him
off
with
a
that
was
the
way
we
stood
by
our
children
and
we
looked
to
them
to
stand
by
us
once
when
i
was
older
my
enemies
tried
to
do
me
they
charged
me
with
a
murder
that
i
never
done
but
d
think
my
old
father
ever
stopped
to
ask
if
i
done
it
or
not
not
much
do
mention
that
bob
my
boy
says
he
it
all
part
of
the
fight
an
we
wid
yer
a
pause
i
looked
about
me
at
the
world
and
i
found
it
was
full
of
all
sorts
of
pleasant
things
that
i
never
had
and
never
stood
a
chance
of
havin
they
were
for
the
rich
the
people
on
top
and
they
looked
on
with
scorn
i
was
poor
and
i
was
low
and
i
was
fit
for
anything
and
so
i
set
to
climb
i
shouldered
my
way
up
i
met
men
that
fought
me
i
fought
them
back
and
i
won
out
that
the
sort
of
man
i
am
laura
i
see
a
selfish
man
bent
upon
power
at
any
price
a
brutal
man
profiting
by
the
weakness
of
others
an
unscrupulous
man
trading
upon
fear
and
greed
a
man
who
has
stopped
at
no
evil
to
gain
his
purpose
grimes
i
am
what
the
game
has
made
me
laura
not
so
not
so
many
another
man
has
been
born
to
a
fate
like
yours
and
has
fought
his
way
up
from
the
pit
to
be
a
tower
of
strength
for
goodness
and
service
an
honor
to
his
people
and
himself
grimes
i
not
met
any
such
laura
no
you
not
sought
for
them
you
did
not
need
them
in
your
business

men
you
needed
were
the
thugs
and
the
criminals
who
could
stuff
for
you
the
and
the
who
would
contribute
to
your
campaign
funds
and
you
have
dealt
with
them
you
have
built
up
the
power
they
gave
you
into
a
mighty
engine
of
corruption
and
wrong
and
you
are
master
of
it
you
use
it
to
wring
tribute
from
high
and
low
selling
immunity
to
and
betraying
helpless
young
girls
naming
legislators
and
judges
and
receiving
bribes
to
corrupt
the
highest
court
in
the
state

broke
his
heart
and
just
now
he
is
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
the
rage
of
it
is
on
him
but
afterwards
he
will
recollect
he
will
be
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
then
he
will
see
he
will
do
what
i
have
begged
him
to
montague
yes
perhaps
that
is
so
laura
i
know
what
my
love
means
to
him
i
know
what
he
is
at
heart
and
when
he
sees
that
i
mean
to
carry
out
my
threat
to
go
by
myself
and
to
refuse
to
touch
his
money
that
will
be
more
than
he
can
bear
montague
montague
you
mean
to
do
that
laura
i
mean
to
do
it
i
mean
to
do
it
today
and
i
will
never
yield
to
him
never
until
he
has
atoned
for
this
wrong
he
has
done
and
you
see
that
i
will
win
in
the
end
montague
yes
i
see
laura
quickly
understand
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
course
i
am
not
asking
you
to
spare
him
you
must
go
ahead
and
do
your
duty
you
must
do
just
what
you
would
have
done
if
i
had
never
stood
in
the
way
montague
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
me
miss
hegan
i
can
not
turn
back
laura
you
must
not
you
must
not
think
of
it
it
will
be
a
part
of
my
father
punishment
and
he
has
deserved
it
he
has
prepared
that
cup
and
he
must
drink
it
to
the
dregs
montague
you
can
bear
it
laura
it
is
not
any
question
of
what
i
can
bear
it
is
a
question
of
the
rights
of
the
people
i
saw
that
quite
clearly
as
my
father
talked
with
me
whether
it
is
he
who
wins
or
whether
it
is
murdock
it
is
always
the
people
that
lose
and
let
it
hurt
whom
it
may
the
people
must
have
the
truth
montague
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
forgive
me
ah
what
a
weight
you
lift
from
me
i
hardly
dared
to
face
the
thought
of
what
i
had
to
do
hesitating
and
then
the
thought
that
you
mean
to
renounce
your
father
wealth
that
you
are
going
out
into
the
world
alone
laura
it
will
not
be
hard
for
me
you
can
not
know
how
i
have
hated
my
past
life
to
know
that
my
father
has
plundered
the
public
and
then
to
give
his
money
and
call
it
charity
to
be
flattered
and
fawned
upon
to
be
celebrated
and
admired
and
never
for
anything
that
i
am
but
always
for
my
money
montague
i
understand
what
you
feel
and
see
what
your
decision
means
to
me
it
sets
me
free
at
last
laura
free
montague
free
to
speak
miss
hegan
i
came
to
new
york
and
i
met
these
rich
people
and
i
saw
how
their
fortunes
were
poisoning
their
lives
i
saw
men
who
could
not
have
a
real
friend
in
the
world
because
of
their
money
i
saw
young
girls
whose
souls
were
utterly
dead
in
them
because
they
had
been
brought
up
to
think
of
themselves
as
keepers
of
and
to
guard
against
men
who
sought
to
prey
upon
them
i
hated
the
thing
i
fled
from
it
as
i
would
from
a
plague
in
that
world
i
had
met
a
woman
i
might
have
loved
a
woman
who
was
noble
and
beautiful
and
true
and
yet
i
dared
not
speak
to
her
i
dared
not
even
permit
myself
to
know
her
because
i
was
a
poor
man
and
she
was
rich
but
now
she
is
to
be
poor
also
and
so
i
may
speak
laura
starting
oh
montague
miss
hegan
from
the
first
time
i
met
you
i
felt
that
you
were
the
woman
i
should
love
but
then
as
fate
would
have
it
i
found
myself
preparing
to
attack
your
father
so
i
said
that
we
must
never
meet
again
but
now
you
see
how
it
has
happened
i
have
come
to
know
you
as
i
never
hoped
to
know
you
and
i
know
that

no
idea

the
same
purpose
we
have
the
same
battle
to
fight
we
can
go
out
to
the
people
and

teach
them
laura
you

know
that
you
love
me

you

want
nothing
so
much
as
the
chance
to
serve
you
and
help
you
the
chance
to
tell
you
so
is
more
than
i
had
ever
ventured
to
hope
for
to
find
you
free
and
alone
to
be
able
to
speak
to
you
with
no
thought
of
wealth
or
position
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
just
you
you
laura
i
hardly
dare
to
think
of
it
now
here
montague
we
can
put
all
the
past
behind
us
we
can
take
a
new
start
and
win
our
own
way
if
only
you
love
me

let
myself
be
happy
again

love
me

the
key
to

face
the
world
