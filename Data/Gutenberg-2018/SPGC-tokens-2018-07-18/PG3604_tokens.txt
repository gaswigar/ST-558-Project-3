preface
this
book
deals
with
the
intensive
campaign
of
the
militant
suffragists
of
america
to
win
a
solitary
passage
by
congress
of
the
national
suffrage
amendment
enfranchising
women
it
is
the
story
of
the
first
organized
militant
political
action
in
america
to
this
end
the
militants
differed
from
the
pure
propagandists
in
the
woman
suffrage
movement
chiefly
in
that
they
had
a
clear
comprehension
of
the
forces
which
prevail
in
politics
they
appreciated
the
necessity
of
the
propaganda
stage
and
the
beautiful
heroism
of
those
who
had
led
in
the
pioneer
agitation
but
they
knew
that
this
stage
belonged
to
the
past
these
methods
were
no
longer
necessary
or
effective
for
convenience
sake
i
have
called
part
ii
political
action
and
part
iii
militancy
although
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
entire
campaign
was
one
of
militant
political
action
the
emphasis
however
in
part
ii
is
upon
political
action
although
certainly
with
a
militant
mood
in
part
iii
dramatic
acts
of
protest
such
as
are
now
commonly
called
militancy
are
given
emphasis
as
they
acquired
a
greater
importance
during
the
latter
part
of
the
campaign
this
does
not
mean
that
all
militant
deeds
were
not
committed
for
a
specific
political
purpose
they
were
but
militancy
is
as
much
a
state
of
mind
an
approach
to
a
task
as
it
is
the
commission
of
deeds
of
protest
it
is
the
state
of
mind
of
those
who
is
their
fiery
idealism
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
real
springs
of
human
action
there
are
two
ways
in
which
this
story
might
be
told
it
might
be
told
as
a
tragic
and
harrowing
tale
of
martyrdom
or
it
might
be
told
as
a
ruthless
enterprise
of
compelling
a
hostile
administration
to
subject
women
to
martyrdom
in
order
to
hasten
its
surrender
the
truth
is
it
has
elements
of
both
ruthlessness
and
martyrdom
and
i
have
tried
to
make
them
appear
in
a
true
proportion
it
is
my
sincere
hope
that
you
viii
will
understand
and
appreciate
the
martyrdom
involved
for
it
was
the
conscious
voluntary
gift
of
beautiful
strong
and
young
hearts
but
it
was
never
martyrdom
for
its
own
sake
it
was
martyrdom
used
for
a
practical
purpose
the
narrative
ends
with
the
passage
of
the
amendment
by
congress
the
campaign
for
ratification
which
extended
over
fourteen
months
is
a
story
in
itself
the
ratification
of
the
amendment
by
the
and
last
state
legislature
proved
as
difficult
to
secure
from
political
leaders
as
the
and
last
vote
in
the
united
states
senate
this
book
contains
my
interpretations
which
are
of
course
arguable

a

anthony
susan
anthony
was
the
first
militant
suffragist
she
has
been
so
long
proclaimed
only
as
the
magnificent
pioneer
that
few
realize
that
she
was
the
first
woman
to
defy
the
law
for
the
political
liberty
of
her
sex
the
militant
spirit
was
in
her
many
early
protests
sometimes
these
protests
were
supported
by
one
or
two
followers
more
often
they
were
solitary
protests
perhaps
it
is
because
of
their
isolation
that
they
stand
out
so
strong
and
beautiful
in
a
turbulent
time
in
our
history
when
all
those
about
her
were
making
compromises
it
was
this
spirit
which
impelled
her
to
keep
alive
the
cause
of
the
enfranchisement
of
women
during
the
passionate
years
of
the
civil
war
she
held
to
the
last
possible
moment
that
no
national
exigency
was
great
enough
to
warrant
abandonment
of
woman
fight
for
independence
but
one
by
one
her
followers
deserted
her
she
was
unable
to
keep
even
a
tiny
handful
steadfast
to
this
position
she
became
finally
the
only
figure
in
the
nation
appealing
for
the
rights
of
women
when
the
rights
of
black
men
were
agitating
the
public
mind
ardent
abolitionist
as
she
was
she
could
not
tolerate
without
indignant
protest
the
exclusion
of
women
in
all
discussions
of
emancipation
the
suffrage
war
policy
of
miss
anthony
can
be
compared
to
that
of
the
militants
a
half
century
later
when
confronted
with
the
problem
of
this
entrance
into
the
world
war
the
war
of
the
rebellion
over
and
the
emancipation
of
the
negro
man
written
into
the
constitution
women
contended
they
had
a
right
to
vote
under
the
new
fourteenth
amendment
miss
anthony
led
in
this
agitation
urging
all
women
to
claim
the
right
to
vote
under
this
amendment
in
the
national
election
of
she
voted
in
rochester
new
york
her
home
city
was
arrested
tried
and
convicted
of
the
crime
of
voting
without
having
a
lawful
right
to
vote
i
can
not
resist
giving
a
brief
excerpt
from
the
court
records
of
this
extraordinary
case
so
reminiscent
is
it
of
the
cases
of
the
suffrage
pickets
tried
nearly
fifty
years
later
in
the
courts
of
the
national
capital
after
the
prosecuting
attorney
had
presented
the
case
judge
hunt
read
his
opinion
said
to
have
been
written
before
the
case
had
been
heard
and
directed
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
the
jury
was
dismissed
without
deliberation
and
a
new
trial
was
refused
on
the
following
day
this
scene
took
place
in
that
new
york
court
room
judge
hunt
ordering
the
defendant
to
stand
up
the
prisoner
anything
to
say
why
sentence
shall
not
be
pronounced
miss
your
honor
i
have
many
things
to
say
for
in
your
ordered
verdict
of
guilty
you
have
trampled
under
foot
every
vital
principle
of
our
government
my
natural
rights
my
civil
rights
my
political
rights
my
judicial
rights
are
all
alike
ignored
robbed
of
the
fundamental
privilege
of
citizenship
i
am
degraded
from
the
status
of
a
citizen
to
that
of
a
subject
and
not
only
myself
individually
but
all
my
sex
are
by
your
honor
verdict
doomed
to
political
subjection
under
this
republican
form
of
government
judge
court
can
not
listen
to
a
rehearsal
of
argument
which
the
prisoner
counsel
has
already
consumed
three
hours
in
presenting
miss
it
please
your
honor
i
am
not
arguing
the
question
but
simply
stating
the
reasons
why
sentence
can
not
in
justice
be
pronounced
against
me
your
denial
of
my
citizen
right
to
vote
is
the
denial
of
my
right
of
consent
as
one
of
the
governed
the
denial
of
my
right
of
representation
as
one
taxed
the
denial
of
my
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
of
my
peers
as
an
offender
against
law
therefore
the
denial
of
my
sacred
right
to
life
liberty
property
and
judge
court
can
not
allow
the
prisoner
to
go
on
miss
your
honor
will
not
deny
me
this
one
and
only
poor
privilege
of
protest
against
this
highhanded
outrage
upon
my
citizen
rights
may
it
please
the
court
to
remember
that
since
the
day
of
my
arrest
last
november
this
is
the
first
time
that
either
myself
or
any
person
of
my
disfranchised
class
has
been
allowed
a
word
of
defense
before
judge
or
jury
judge
prisoner
must
sit
down
the
court
can
not
allow
it
miss
all
my
persecutors
from
the

who
entered
the
complaint
to
the

marshal
commissioner

attorney
district
judge
your
honor
on
the
bench
not
one
is
my
peer
but
each
and
all
are
my
political
sovereigns
precisely
as
no
disfranchised
person
is
entitled
to
sit
upon
the
jury
and
no
woman
is
entitled
to
the
franchise
so
none
but
a
regularly
admitted
lawyer
is
allowed
to
practice
in
the
courts
and
no
woman
can
gain
admission
to
the
jury
judge
counsel
all
must
be
of
superior
class
judge
court
must
prisoner
has
been
tried
according
to
the
established
forms
of
law
miss
your
honor
but
by
forms
of
law
all
made
by
men
interpreted
by
men
administered
by
men
in
favor
of
men
and
against
women
and
hence
your
honor
ordered
verdict
of
guilty
against
a
united
states
citizen
for
the
exercise
of
the
citizen
right
to
vote
simply
because
that
citizen
was
a
woman
and
not
a
man
as
then
the
slaves
who
got
their
freedom
had
to
take
it
over
or
under
or
through
the
unjust
forms
of
the
law
precisely
so
now
must
women
take
it
to
get
their
right
to
a
voice
in
this
government
and
i
have
taken
mine
and
mean
to
take
it
at
every
opportunity
judge
court
orders
the
prisoner
to
sit
down
it
will
not
allow
another
word
miss
i
was
brought
before
your
honor
for
trial
i
hoped
for
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
constitution
and
its
recent
amendments
which
should
declare
all
united
states
citizens
under
its
protecting
aegis
but
failing
to
get
this
justice
failing
even
to
get
a
trial
by
a
of
my
ask
not
leniency
at
but
rather
the
full
rigor
of
the
law
judge
court
must
insist
here
the
prisoner
sat
down
the
prisoner
will
stand
up
here
miss
anthony
rose
again
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
that
you
pay
a
fine
of
and
the
costs
of
the
prosecution
miss
it
please
your
honor
i
will
never
pay
a
dollar
of
your
unjust
penalty
and
i
shall
earnestly
and
persistently
continue
to
urge
all
women
to
the
practical
recognition
of
the
old
revolutionary
maxim
resistance
to
tyranny
is
obedience
to
god
judge
the
court
will
not
order
you
stand
committed
until
the
fine
is
paid
miss
anthony
did
not
pay
her
fine
and
was
never
imprisoned
i
believe
the
fine
stands
against
her
to
this
day
on
the
heels
of
this
sensation
came
another
of
those
dramatic
protests
which
until
the
very
end
she
always
combined
with
political
agitation
the
nation
was
celebrating
its
first
centenary
of
the
signing
of
the
declaration
of
independence
at
independence
square
philadelphia
after
women
had
been
refused
by
all
in
authority
a
humble
half
moment
in
which
to
present
to
the
centennial
the
women
declaration
of
rights
miss
anthony
insisted
on
being
heard
immediately
after
the
declaration
of
independence
had
been
read
by
a
patriot
she
led
a
committee
of
women
who
with
platform
tickets
had
slipped
through
the
military
straight
down
the
center
aisle
of
the
platform
to
address
the
chairman
who
pale
with
fright
and
powerless
to
stop
the
demonstration
had
to
accept
her
document
instantly
the
platform
graced
as
it
was
by
national
dignitaries
and
crowned
heads
was
astir
the
women
retired
distributing
to
the
gasping
spectators
copies
of
their
declaration
miss
anthony
had
reminded
the
nation
of
the
hollowness
of
its
celebration
of
an
independence
that
excluded
women
susan
anthony
aim
was
the
national
enfranchisement
of
women
as
soon
as
she
became
convinced
that
the
constitution
would
have
to
be
specifically
amended
to
include
woman
suffrage
she
set
herself
to
this
gigantic
task
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
she
appealed
to
congress
for
action
and
to
party
conventions
for
suffrage
endorsement
when
however
she
saw
that
congress
was
obdurate
as
an
able
and
intensely
practical
leader
she
temporarily
directed
the
main
energy
of
the
suffrage
movement
to
trying
to
win
individual
states
with
women
holding
the
balance
of
political
power
she
argued
the
national
government
will
be
compelled
to
act
she
knew
so
well
the
value
of
power
she
went
to
the
west
to
get
it
she
was
a
shrewd
tactician
with
prophetic
insight
without
compromise
to
those
women
who
would
yield
to
party
expediency
as
advised
by
men
or
be
diverted
into
support
of
other
measures
she
made
answer
in
a
spirited
letter
to
lucy
stone
so
long
as
you
and
i
and
all
women
are
political
slaves
it
ill
becomes
us
to
meddle
with
the
weightier
discussions
of
sovereign
masters
it
will
be
quite
time
enough
for
us
with
to
declare
ourselves
for
or
against
any
party
upon
the
intrinsic
merit
of
its
policy
when
men
shall
recognize
us
as
their
political
equals
if
all
the
suffragists
of
all
the
states
could
see
eye
to
eye
on
this
point
and
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
against
every
party
and
politician
not
fully
and
unequivocally
committed
to
rights
for
women
we
should
become
at
once
the
moral
balance
of
power
which
could
not
fail
to
compel
the
party
of
highest
intelligence
to
proclaim
woman
suffrage
the
chief
plank
of
its
platform
until
that
good
day
comes
i
shall
continue
to
invoke
the
party
in
power
and
each
party
struggling
to
get
into
power
to
pledge
itself
to
the
emancipation
of
our
enslaved
half
of
the
people
she
did
not
live
to
see
enough
states
grant
suffrage
in
the
west
to
form
a
balance
of
power
with
which
to
carry
out
this
policy
she
did
not
live
to
turn
this
power
upon
an
unwilling
congress
but
she
stood
to
the
last
despite
this
temporary
change
of
program
the
great
dramatic
protagonist
of
national
freedom
for
women
and
its
achievement
through
rebellion
and
practical
strategy
with
the
passing
of
miss
anthony
and
her
leadership
the
movement
in
america
went
conscientiously
on
endeavoring
to
pile
up
state
after
state
in
the
free
column
gradually
her
followers
lost
sight
of
her
aggressive
attack
and
her
enfranchisement
of
women
by
congress
they
did
not
sustain
her
tactical
wisdom
this
reform
movement
like
all
others
when
stretched
over
a
long
period
of
time
found
itself
confined
in
a
narrow
circle
of
routine
propaganda
it
lacked
the
power
and
initiative
to
extricate
itself
though
it
had
many
eloquent
agitators
with
devoted
followings
it
lacked
generalship
the
movement
also
lost
miss
anthony
militant
spirit
her
keen
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
the
attention
of
the
nation
must
be
focussed
on
minority
issues
by
dramatic
acts
of
protest
susan
anthony
fundamental
objective
her
political
attitude
toward
attaining
it
and
her
militant
spirit
were
revived
in
suffrage
history
in
when
alice
paul
also
of
quaker
background
entered
the
national
field
as
leader
of
the
new
suffrage
forces
in
america
chapter
a
militant
paul
most
people
conjure
up
a
menacing
picture
when
a
person
is
called
not
only
a
general
but
a
militant
one
in
appearance
alice
paul
is
anything
but
menacing
quiet
almost
mouselike
this
frail
young
quakeress
sits
in
silence
and
baffles
you
with
her
contradictions
large
soft
gray
eyes
that
strike
you
with
a
positive
impact
make
you
feel
the
indescribable
force
and
power
behind
them
a
mass
of
soft
brown
hair
caught
easily
at
the
neck
makes
the
contour
of
her
head
strong
and
graceful
tiny
fragile
hands
that
look
more
like
an
picture
of
hands
rest
in
her
lap
in
quakerish
pose
her
whole
atmosphere
when
she
is
not
in
action
is
one
of
strength
and
quiet
determination
in
action
she
is
swift
alert
almost
in
her
movements
dressed
always
in
simple
frocks
preferably
soft
shades
of
purple
she
conforms
to
an
individual
style
and
taste
of
her
own
rather
than
to
the
prevailing
vogue
i
am
going
recklessly
on
to
try
to
tell
what
i
think
about
alice
paul
it
is
difficult
for
when
i
begin
to
put
it
down
on
paper
i
realize
how
little
we
know
about
this
laconic
person
and
yet
how
abundantly
we
feel
her
power
her
will
and
her
compelling
leadership
in
an
instant
and
vivid
reaction
i
am
either
congealed
or
inspired
exhilarated
or
depressed
sometimes
even
exasperated
but
always
moved
i
have
seen
her
very
presence
in
headquarters
change
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
mood
of
fifty
people
it
is
not
through
their
affections
that
she
moves
them
but
through
a
naked
force
a
vital
force
which
is
indefinable
but
of
which
one
simply
can
not
be
unaware
aiming
primarily
at
the
intellect
of
an
audience
or
an
individual
she
almost
never
fails
to
win
an
emotional
allegiance
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
contact
with
her
i
tell
it
here
as
an
illustration
of
what
happened
to
countless
women
who
came
in
touch
with
her
to
remain
under
her
leadership
to
the
end
i
had
come
to
washington
to
take
part
in
the
demonstration
on
the
senate
in
july
en
route
to
a
muchneeded
as
i
thought
holiday
in
the
adirondacks
ca
you
stay
on
and
help
us
with
a
hearing
next
week
said
miss
paul
i
sorry
said
i
but
i
have
promised
to
join
a
party
of
friends
in
the
mountains
for
a
summer
holiday
and
holiday
said
she
looking
straight
at
me
instantly
ashamed
at
having
mentioned
such
a
legitimate
excuse
i
murmured
something
about
not
having
had
one
since
before
entering
college
but
ca
you
stay
she
said
i
was
lost
i
knew
i
would
stay
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
stayed
through
the
heat
of
a
washington
summer
returned
only
long
enough
at
the
end
of
the
summer
to
close
up
my
work
in
state
suffrage
and
came
back
to
join
the
group
at
washington
and
it
was
years
before
i
ever
mentioned
a
holiday
again
frequently
she
achieved
her
end
without
even
a
single
word
of
retort
soon
after
miss
paul
came
to
washington
in
she
went
to
call
on
a
suffragist
in
that
city
to
ask
her
to
donate
some
funds
toward
the
rent
of
headquarters
in
the
capital
the
woman
sighed
i
thought
when
miss
anthony
died
she
said
that
all
my
troubles
were
at
an
end
she
used
to
come
to
me
for
money
for
a
federal
amendment
and
i
always
told
her
it
was
wrong
to
ask
for
one
and
that
besides
we
would
never
get
it
but
she
kept
right
on
coming
then
when
she
died
we
did
hear
any
more
about
an
amendment
and
now
you
come
again
saying
the
same
things
miss
anthony
said
miss
paul
listened
said
she
was
sorry
and
departed
very
shortly
a
check
arrived
at
headquarters
to
cover
a
month
rent
a
model
listener
alice
paul
has
unlimited
capacity
for
letting
the
other
person
relieve
herself
of
all
her
objections
without
contest
over
and
over
again
i
have
heard
this
scene
enacted
miss
paul
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
you
are
all
wrong
about
this
federal
amendment
business
i
do
believe
in
it
suffrage
should
come
slowly
but
surely
by
the
states
and
although
i
have
been
a
suffragist
i
just
want
to
tell
you
not
to
count
on
me
for
feeling
as
i
do
i
can
not
give
you
any
help
a
silence
would
follow
then
miss
paul
would
say
ingenuously
have
you
a
half
hour
to
spare
i
guess
so
would
come
slowly
from
the
protestant
wo
you
please
sit
down
right
here
and
put
the
stamps
on
these
letters
we
have
to
get
them
in
the
mail
by
noon
but
i
do
believe
oh
that
all
right
these
letters
are
going
to
women
probably
a
lot
of
whom
feel
as
you
do
but
some
of
them
will
want
to
come
to
the
meeting
to
hear
our
side
by
this
time
miss
paul
would
have
brought
a
chair
and
that
ended
the
argument
the
woman
would
stay
and
humbly
proceed
to
stick
on
endless
stamps
usually
she
would
come
back
too
and
before
many
days
would
be
an
ardent
worker
for
the
cause
against
which
she
thought
herself
invincible
once
the
state
president
of
the
conservative
suffrage
forces
in
ohio
with
whom
i
had
worked
the
previous
year
wrote
me
a
letter
pointing
out
what
madness
it
was
to
talk
of
winning
the
amendment
in
congress
this
session
and
adding
that
nobody
but
a
fool
would
ever
think
of
it
let
alone
speak
of
it
publicly
she
was
wise
in
politics
we
were
nice
eager
young
girls
but
pretty
was
the
gist
of
her
remonstrance
my
vanity
was
aroused
not
wishing
to
be
called
mad
or
foolish
i
sat
down
and
answered
her
in
a
friendly
spirit
with
the
sole
object
of
proving
that
we
were
wiser
than
she
imagined
i
had
never
discussed
this
point
with
anybody
as
i
had
been
in
washington
only
a
few
months
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
we
were
not
right
to
talk
of
getting
the
amendment
in
that
particular
session
but
i
answered
my
patronizing
friend
in
effect
that
of
course
we
were
not
fools
that
we
knew
we
would
not
get
the
amendment
that
session
but
we
saw
no
reason
for
not
demanding
it
at
once
and
taking
it
when
we
got
it
when
miss
paul
saw
the
carbon
of
that
letter
she
said
quietly
pointing
to
the
part
where
i
had
so
nobly
defended
our
sagacity
you
must
never
say
that
again
and
never
put
it
on
paper
seeing
my
embarrassment
she
hastened
to
explain
you
see
we
can
get
it
this
session
if
enough
women
care
sufficiently
to
demand
it
now
alice
paul
brought
back
to
the
fight
that
note
of
immediacy
which
had
gone
with
the
passing
of
miss
anthony
leadership
she
called
a
halt
on
further
pleading
wheedling
proving
praying
it
was
as
if
she
had
bidden
women
stand
erect
with
confidence
in
themselves
and
in
their
own
judgments
and
compelled
them
to
be
enough
to
dare
to
put
their
freedom
first
and
so
determine
for
themselves
the
day
when
they
should
be
free
those
who
had
a
taste
of
begging
under
the
old
regime
and
who
abandoned
it
for
demanding
know
how
fine
and
strong
a
thing
it
is
to
realize
that
you
must
take
what
is
yours
and
not
waste
your
energy
proving
that
you
are
or
will
some
day
be
worthy
of
a
gift
of
power
from
your
masters
on
that
glad
day
of
discovery
you
have
first
freed
yourself
to
fight
for
freedom
alice
paul
gave
to
thousands
of
women
the
essence
of
freedom
and
there
was
something
so
cleansing
about
the
way
in
which
she
renovated
ideas
and
processes
emotions
and
instincts
her
attack
was
so
direct
so
clear
so
simple
and
unafraid
and
her
resistance
had
such
a
fine
quality
of
strength
sometimes
it
was
a
roaring
politician
who
was
baffled
by
this
force
i
have
heard
many
an
irate
one
come
into
her
office
in
the
early
days
to
tell
her
how
to
run
the
campaign
and
struggle
in
vain
to
arouse
her
to
combat
having
begun
a
tirade
honor
would
compel
him
to
see
it
through
even
without
help
from
a
silent
adversary
and
so
he
would
get
more
and
more
noisy
until
it
would
seem
as
if
one
lone
shout
from
him
might
be
enough
to
blow
away
the
frail
object
of
his
attack
ultimately
he
would
be
forced
to
retire
perhaps
in
the
face
of
a
serene
smile
beaten
and
angered
that
he
had
been
able
to
make
so
little
impression
and
many
the
delicious
remark
and
delightful
quip
afterward
at
his
expense
her
gentle
humor
is
of
the
highest
quality
if
only
her
opponents
could
have
seen
her
amusement
at
their
hysteria
at
the
very
moment
they
were
denouncing
some
plan
of
action
and
calling
her
fanatical
and
hysterical
she
would
fairly
beam
with
delight
to
see
how
well
her
plan
had
worked
her
intention
had
been
to
arouse
them
to
just
that
state
of
mind
and
how
admirably
they
were
living
up
to
the
plan
the
hysteria
was
all
on
their
side
she
coolly
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
watched
their
antics
under
pressure
but
do
you
know
would
come
another
thundering
one
that
this
will
make
the
democratic
leaders
so
hostile
that
the
note
of
surprise
never
came
she
had
counted
ahead
on
all
this
and
knew
almost
to
the
last
shade
the
reaction
that
would
follow
from
both
majority
and
minority
leaders
all
this
had
been
thoroughly
gone
over
first
with
herself
then
with
her
colleagues
all
the
alarms
had
been
rung
the
male
politician
could
not
understand
why
his
wellmeaning
and
advice
caused
not
a
ripple
and
not
a
change
in
plan
such
calm
unconcern
he
could
not
endure
he
was
accustomed
to
emotional
panics
he
was
not
accustomed
to
a
leader
who
had
weighed
every
objection
every
attack
and
counted
the
cost
accurately
her
ability
to
marshal
arguments
for
keeping
her
own
followers
in
line
was
equally
marked
a
superficial
observer
would
rush
into
headquarters
with
miss
paul
do
you
think
it
was
a
great
tactical
mistake
to
force
president
wilson
at
this
time
to
state
his
position
on
the
amendment
will
it
not
hurt
our
campaign
to
have
it
known
that
he
is
against
us
it
is
the
best
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
to
us
if
he
is
against
us
women
should
know
it
they
will
be
aroused
to
greater
action
if
he
is
not
allowed
to
remain
silent
upon
something
in
which
he
does
not
believe
it
will
make
it
easier
for
us
to
campaign
against
him
when
the
time
comes
and
another
time
a
friend
of
the
cause
would
suggest
would
it
not
have
been
better
not
to
have
tried
for
planks
in
party
platforms
since
we
got
such
weak
ones
not
at
all
we
can
draw
the
support
of
women
with
greater
ease
from
a
party
which
shows
a
weak
hand
on
suffrage
than
from
one
which
hides
its
opposition
behind
silence
she
had
always
to
combat
the
fear
of
the
more
timid
ones
who
felt
sure
with
each
new
wave
of
disapproval
that
we
would
be
submerged
now
i
have
been
a
supporter
of
yours
every
step
of
the
way
a
fearful
one
would
say
but
this
is
really
going
a
little
too
far
i
was
in
the
senate
gallery
when
two
suffrage
senators
in
speeches
denounced
the
pickets
and
their
suffrage
banners
they
said
that
we
were
setting
suffrage
back
and
that
something
ought
to
be
done
about
it
exactly
so
would
come
the
ready
answer
from
miss
paul
and
they
will
do
something
about
it
only
if
we
continue
to
make
them
uncomfortable
enough
of
course
even
suffrage
senators
will
object
to
our
pickets
and
our
banners
because
they
do
not
want
attention
called
to
their
failure
to
compel
the
administration
to
act
they
know
that
as
friends
of
the
measure
their
responsibility
is
greater
and
the
fearful
one
was
usually
convinced
and
made
stronger
i
remember
so
well
when
the
situation
was
approaching
its
final
climax
in
washington
men
and
women
both
came
to
miss
paul
with
this
is
terrible
seven
months
sentence
is
impossible
you
must
stop
you
can
not
keep
this
up
with
an
unmistakable
note
of
triumph
in
her
voice
miss
paul
would
answer
yes
it
is
terrible
for
us
but
not
nearly
so
terrible
as
for
the
government
the
administration
has
fired
its
heaviest
gun
from
now
on
we
shall
win
and
they
will
lose
most
of
the
doubters
had
by
this
time
banished
their
fears
and
had
come
to
believe
with
something
akin
to
superstition
that
she
could
never
be
wrong
so
swiftly
and
surely
did
they
see
her
policies
and
her
predictions
on
every
point
vindicated
before
their
eyes
she
has
been
a
master
at
concentration
a
master
great
general
with
passionate
beliefs
on
all
important
social
questions
she
resolutely
set
herself
against
being
seduced
into
other
paths
far
from
being
naturally
an
ascetic
she
has
disciplined
herself
into
denials
and
deprivations
cultural
and
recreational
to
pursue
her
objective
with
the
least
possible
waste
of
energy
not
that
she
did
not
want
above
all
else
to
do
this
thing
she
did
but
doing
it
she
had
to
abandon
the
easy
life
of
a
scholar
and
the
aristocratic
environment
of
a
cultured
prosperous
quaker
family
of
moorestown
new
jersey
for
the
rigors
of
a
ceaseless
drudgery
and
frequent
imprisonment
a
flaming
idealist
conducting
the
fight
with
the
sternest
kind
of
realism
a
mind
attracted
by
facts
not
fancies
she
has
led
fearlessly
and
with
magnificent
ruthlessness
ing
thinking
day
and
night
of
her
objective
and
never
retarding
her
pace
a
moment
until
its
accomplishment
i
know
no
modern
woman
leader
with
whom
to
compare
her
i
think
she
must
possess
many
of
the
same
qualities
that
lenin
does
according
to
authentic
portraits
of
practical
rational
sitting
quietly
at
a
desk
and
counting
the
consequences
planning
the
next
move
before
the
first
one
is
finished
and
if
she
has
demanded
the
ultimate
of
her
followers
she
has
given
it
herself
her
ability
to
get
women
to
work
and
never
to
let
them
stop
is
second
only
to
her
own
unprecedented
capacity
for
work
alice
paul
came
to
leadership
still
in
her
twenties
but
with
a
broad
cultural
equipment
degrees
from
swarthmore
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
special
study
abroad
in
english
universities
had
given
her
a
scholarly
background
in
history
politics
and
sociology
in
these
studies
she
had
specialized
writing
her
doctor
thesis
on
the
status
of
women
she
also
did
factory
work
in
english
industries
and
there
acquired
first
hand
knowledge
of
the
industrial
position
of
women
in
the
midst
of
this
work
the
english
militant
movement
caught
her
imagination
and
she
abandoned
her
studies
temporarily
to
join
that
movement

among
the

sent

this

from

chief
justice
of

supreme
court
of

southern
democrat
confederate
veteran
and
distinguished
jurist
will
you
permit

to
congratulate
you
upon
the
great
triumph
in
which
you
have
been
so
important
a
factor
your
place
in
history
is
assured
some
years
ago
when
i
first
met
you
i
predicted
that
your
name
would
be
written
the
dusty
roll
the
ages
keep
there
were
politicians
and
a
large
degree
of
public
sentiment
which
could
only
be
won
by
the
methods
you
adopted
it
is
certain
that
but
for
you
success
would
have
been
delayed
for
many

women
invade
the
capital
where
are
the
people
this
was
woodrow
wilson
first
question
as
he
arrived
at
the
union
station
in
washington
the
day
before
his
first
inauguration
to
the
presidency
in
march
on
the
avenue
watching
the
suffragists
parade
came
the
answer
the
suffrage
issue
was
brought
oftenest
to
his
attention
from
then
on
until
his
final
surrender
it
lay
entirely
with
him
as
to
how
long
women
would
be
obliged
to
remind
him
of
this
issue
before
he
willed
to
take
a
hand
the
people
were
on
the
avenue
watching
the
suffragists
parade
the
informant
was
quite
right
it
seemed
to
those
of
us
who
attempted
to
march
for
our
idea
that
day
that
the
whole
world
was
closely
on
pennsylvania
avenue
the
purpose
of
the
procession
was
to
dramatize
in
numbers
and
beauty
the
fact
that
women
wanted
to
vote
that
women
were
asking
the
administration
in
power
in
the
national
government
to
speed
the
day
what
politicians
had
not
been
able
to
get
through
their
minds
we
would
give
them
through
their
a
powerful
substitute
our
first
task
seemed
simple
actually
to
show
that
thousands
of
women
wanted
immediate
action
on
their
long
delayed
enfranchisement
this
we
did
this
was
the
first
demonstration
under
the
leadership
of
alice
paul
at
that
time
chairman
of
the
congressional
mittee
of
the
national
american
woman
suffrage
association
it
was
also
the
beginning
of
woodrow
wilson
liberal
education
the
administration
without
intending
it
played
into
the
hands
of
the
women
from
this
moment
the
women
had
been
given
a
permit
to
march
inadequate
police
protection
allowed
roughs
to
attack
them
and
all
but
break
up
the
beautiful
pageant
the
fact
of
ten
thousand
women
marching
with
banners
and
bands
for
this
idea
was
startling
enough
to
wake
up
the
government
and
the
country
but
not
so
startling
as
ten
thousand
women
by
irresponsible
crowds
because
of
police
indifference
an
investigation
was
demanded
and
a
perfunctory
one
held
the
police
administration
was
exonerated
but
when
the
storm
of
protest
had
subsided
the
chief
of
police
was
quietly
retired
to
private
life
it
was
no
longer
a
secret
that
women
wanted
to
vote
and
that
they
wanted
the
president
and
congress
to
act
a
few
days
later
the
first
deputation
of
suffragists
ever
to
appear
before
a
president
to
enlist
his
support
for
the
passage
of
the
national
suffrage
amendment
waited
upon
president
wilson
miss
paul
led
the
deputation
with
her
were
genevieve
stone
wife
of
congressman
stone
of
illinois
harvey
wiley
ida
husted
harper
and
miss
mary
bartlett
dixon
of
maryland
the
president
received
the
deputation
in
the
white
house
offices
when
the
women
entered
they
found
five
chairs
arranged
in
a
row
with
one
chair
in
front
like
a
room
all
confessed
to
being
frightened
when
the
president
came
in
and
took
his
seat
at
the
head
of
the
class
the
president
said
he
had
no
opinion
on
the
subject
of
woman
suffrage
that
he
had
never
given
it
any
thought
there
had
been
individual
visits
to
previous
presidents
at
colorado
springs
in
when
wilson
was
governor
of
new
jersey
and
campaigning
for
the
presidential
nomination
a
delegation
of
colorado
women
asked
him
his
position
on
woman
suffrage
he
said
ladies
this
is
a
very
arguable
question
and
my
mind
is
in
the
midst
of
the
argument
and
that
above
all
it
was
his
task
to
see
that
congress
concentrated
on
the
currency
revision
and
the
tariff
reform
it
is
recorded
that
the
president
was
somewhat
taken
aback
when
miss
paul
addressed
him
during
the
course
of
the
interview
with
this
query
but
president
do
you
not
understand
that
the
administration
has
no
right
to
legislate
for
currency
tariff
and
any
other
reform
without
first
getting
the
consent
of
women
to
these
reforms
get
the
consent
of
women
it
was
evident
that
this
course
had
not
heretofore
occurred
to
him
this
subject
will
receive
my
most
careful
consideration
was
president
wilson
first
suffrage
promise
he
was
given
time
to
consider
and
a
second
deputation
went
to
him
and
still
a
third
asking
him
to
include
the
suffrage
amendment
in
his
message
to
the
new
congress
assembling
in
extra
session
the
following
month
and
still
he
was
obsessed
with
the
paramount
considerations
of
tariff
and
currency
he
flatly
said
there
would
be
no
time
to
consider
suffrage
for
women
but
the
unreasonable
women
kept
right
on
insisting
that
the
liberty
of
half
the
american
people
was
paramount
to
tariff
and
currency
president
wilson
first
session
of
congress
came
together
april
the
opening
day
was
marked
by
the
suffragists
second
mass
demonstration
this
time
women
delegates
representing
every
one
of
the
congressional
districts
in
the
country
bore
petitions
from
the
constituencies
showing
that
the
people
back
home
wanted
the
amendment
passed
the
delegates
marched
on
congress
and
were
received
with
a
warm
welcome
and
their
petitions
presented
to
congress
the
same
day
the
amendment
which
bears
the
name
of
susan
anthony
who
drafted
it
in
was
reintroduced
into
both
houses
of
congress
the
month
of
may
saw
monster
demonstrations
in
many
cities
and
villages
throughout
the
country
with
the
direct
result
that
in
june
the
senate
committee
on
suffrage
made
the
first
favorable
report
made
by
that
committee
in
years
thereby
placing
it
on
the
senate
calendar
for
action
not
relaxing
the
pressure
for
a
day
we
organized
the
third
great
demonstration
on
the
last
of
july
when
a
monster
petition
signed
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
citizens
was
brought
to
the
senate
asking
that
body
to
pass
the
national
suffrage
amendment
women
from
all
parts
of
the
country
mobilized
in
the
countryside
of
maryland
where
they
were
met
with
appropriate
the
senate
woman
suffrage
committee
the
delegation
motored
in
gaily
decorated
automobiles
to
washington
and
went
direct
to
the
senate
where
the
entire
day
was
given
over
to
suffrage
discussion
senators
spoke
in
favor
of
the
amendment
in
presenting
their
petitions
three
spoke
against
it
for
the
first
time
in
years
suffrage
was
actually
debated
in
congress
that
day
was
historic
speeches
yes
greetings
yes
present
petitions
from
their
constituencies
gladly
report
it
from
the
senate
committee
they
had
to
concede
that
but
passage
of
the
amendment
that
was
beyond
their
contemplation
more
pressure
was
necessary
we
appealed
to
the
women
voters
of
whom
there
were
then
four
million
to
come
into
action
four
million
women
voters
are
watching
you
we
said
to
congress
we
might
as
well
have
said
there
are
in
the
south
sea
islands
four
million
heathens
it
was
clear
that
these
distant
women
voters
had
no
relation
in
the
senatorial
mind
to
the
realism
of
politics
we
decided
to
bring
some
of
these
women
voters
to
washington
having
failed
to
get
the
senate
to
act
by
august
we
invited
the
council
of
women
voters
to
hold
its
convention
in
ington
that
congress
might
learn
this
simple
lesson
women
did
vote
there
were
four
million
of
them
they
had
a
organization
they
cared
about
the
enfranchisement
of
all
american
women
they
wanted
the
senate
to
act
suffrage
was
no
longer
a
moral
problem
it
could
be
made
a
practical
political
problem
with
which
men
and
parties
would
have
to
reckon
voting
women
made
their
first
impression
on
congress
that
summer
meanwhile
the
president
paramount
issues
and
had
been
disposed
of
with
the
december
congress
approaching
he
was
preparing
another
message
we
went
to
him
again
this
time
it
was
the
women
from
his
own
home
state
an
influential
deputation
of
women
including
the
suffrage
leaders
from
all
suffrage
organizations
in
new
jersey
the
women
urged
him
to
include
recommendation
of
the
suffrage
resolution
in
his
message
to
the
new
congress
he
replied
i
am
pleased
indeed
to
greet
you
and
your
adherents
here
and
i
will
say
to
you
that
i
was
talking
only
yesterday
with
several
members
of
congress
in
regard
to
a
suffrage
committee
in
the
house
the
subject
is
one
in
which
i
am
deeply
interested
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
i
will
give
it
my
earnest
attention
in
interesting
himself
in
the
formation
of
a
special
committee
to
sit
on
suffrage
in
the
house
the
president
was
doing
the
smallest
thing
to
be
sure
that
could
be
done
but
he
was
doing
something
this
was
a
distinct
advance
it
was
our
task
to
press
on
until
all
the
maze
of
congressional
machinery
had
been
used
to
exhaustion
then
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
pass
the
amendment
a
fourth
time
that
year
the
determination
of
women
to
secure
the
passage
of
the
amendment
was
demonstrated
in
december
the
opening
week
of
the
new
congress
the
annual
convention
of
the
national
american
woman
suffrage
ciation
was
held
in
washington
miss
lucy
burns
vice
chairman
of
its
congressional
committee
and
also
of
the
congressional
union
was
applauded
to
the
echo
by
the
whole
convention
when
she
said
the
national
american
woman
suffrage
association
is
assembled
in
washington
to
ask
the
democratic
party
to
enfranchise
the
women
of
america
rarely
in
the
history
of
the
country
has
a
party
been
more
powerful
than
the
democratic
party
is
it
controls
the
executive
office
the
senate
and
more
than
of
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
it
is
in
a
position
to
give
us
effective
and
immediate
help
we
ask
the
democrats
to
take
action
now
those
who
hold
power
are
responsible
to
the
country
for
the
use
of
it
they
are
responsible
not
only
for
what
they
do
but
for
what
they
do
not
do
inaction
establishes
just
as
clear
a
record
as
does
a
policy
of
open
hostility
we
have
in
our
hands
not
only
the
weapon
of
a
just
cause
we
have
the
support
of
ten
enfranchised
states
comprising
fifth
of
the
united
states
senate
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
the
electoral
vote
more
than
women
have
a
vote
in
presidential
elections
it
is
unthinkable
that
a
national
government
which
represents
women
and
which
appeals
periodically
for
the
suffrages
of
women
should
ignore
the
issue
of
the
right
of
all
women
to
political
freedom
we
can
not
wait
until
after
the
passage
of
scheduled
administration
reforms
congress
is
free
to
take
action
on
our
question
in
the
present
session
we
ask
the
administration
to
support
the
woman
suffrage
amendment
in
congress
with
its
whole
strength
this
represented
the
attitude
of
the
entire
suffrage
movement
toward
the
situation
in
the
winter
of
at
no
time
did
the
militant
group
deviate
from
this
position
until
the
amendment
was
through
congress
it
was
difficult
to
make
the
administration
believe
that
the
women
meant
what
they
said
and
that
they
meant
to
use
everything
in
their
power
and
resourcefulness
to
see
it
carried
out
men
were
used
to
having
women
ask
them
for
suffrage
but
they
were
disconcerted
at
being
asked
for
it
now
at
being
threatened
with
political
chastisement
if
they
did
not
yield
to
the
demand
in
spite
of
the
repeated
requests
to
president
wilson
that
he
include
support
of
the
measure
in
his
message
to
congress
he
delivered
his
message
december
end
while
the
convention
was
still
in
session
and
failed
to
make
any
mention
of
the
suffrage
amendment
he
recommended
for
filipino
men
instead
immediately
miss
paul
organized
the
entire
convention
into
a
fifth
deputation
to
protest
against
this
failure
and
to
urge
support
in
a
subsequent
message
anna
howard
shaw
led
the
interview
in
reply
to
her
eloquent
appeal
for
his
assistance
the
president
said
in
part
i
am
merely
the
spokesman
of
my
party
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
urge
upon
congress
in
messages
policies
which
have
not
had
the
organic
consideration
of
those
for
whom
i
am
spokesman
i
am
by
my
own
principles
shut
out
in
the
language
of
the
street
from
anything
i
have
to
confine
myself
to
those
things
which
have
been
embodied
as
promises
to
the
people
at
an
election
i
shall
never
forget
that
day
shafts
of
sunlight
came
in
at
the
window
and
fell
full
and
square
upon
the
leader
who
was
in
the
closing
days
of
her
power
her
clear
deep
resonant
voice
ringing
with
the
genuine
love
of
liberty
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
halting
timid
little
and
technical
answer
of
the
president
he
stooped
to
utter
some
light
pleasantry
which
he
thought
would
no
doubt
please
the
ladies
it
did
not
provoke
even
a
faint
smile
shaw
had
dramatically
asked
president
if
you
can
not
speak
for
us
and
your
party
will
not
who
then
pray
is
there
to
speak
for
us
you
seem
very
well
able
to
speak
for
yourselves
ladies
with
a
broad
smile
followed
by
a
quick
embarrassment
when
no
one
stirred
we
mean
president
who
will
speak
for
us
with
authority
came
back
the
hot
retort
from
shaw
the
president
made
no
reply
instead
he
expressed
a
desire
to
shake
the
hands
of
the
three
hundred
delegates
a
few
felt
that
manners
compelled
them
to
acquiesce
the
others
filed
out
without
this
little
political
ceremony
alice
paul
report
to
the
national
convention
for
her
work
as
chairman
of
the
congressional
committee
of
the
national
american
woman
suffrage
association
and
as
chairman
also
of
the
congressional
union
for
woman
suffrage
showed
that
a
budget
of
thousand
dollars
had
been
raised
and
expended
under
her
leadership
as
against
ten
dollars
spent
during
the
previous
year
on
congressional
work
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
there
was
no
interest
in
work
with
congress
it
was
considered
hopeless
at
the
close
of
the
year
it
had
become
a
practical
political
issue
suffrage
had
entered
the
national
field
to
stay
at
this
point
the
congressional
union
for
woman
suffrage
was
obliged
to
become
an
independent
body
in
order
to
continue
this
vigorous
policy
which
the
conservative
suffrage
leaders
were
unwilling
to
follow
hearings
deputations
to
the
president
petitions
to
congress
more
persistent
lobbying
all
these
things
continued
during
the
following
year
under
miss
paul
leadership
with
the
result
that
a
vote
in
the
senate
was
taken
though
at
ran
inopportune
moment
first
vote
in
the
senate
since
the
vote
stood
to
failing
by
votes
of
the
necessary
majority
this
vote
nevertheless
indicated
that
a
new
strength
in
the
suffrage
battle
had
forced
congress
to
take
some
action
in
the
house
the
rules
committee
on
a
vote
of
to
refused
to
create
a
suffrage
committee
we
appealed
to
the
democratic
caucus
to
see
if
tie
party
sustained
this
action
we
wished
to
establish
their
party
responsibility
one
way
or
another
and
by
securing
the
necessary
signatures
to
a
petition
we
compelled
the
caucus
to
meet
by
a
vote
of
to
the
caucus
declared
that
the
question
of
woman
suffrage
is
a
state
and
not
a
federal
question
as
a
substitute
for
the
milder
resolution
offered
providing
for
the
creation
of
a
committee
on
woman
suffrage
if
this
had
left
any
doubt
as
to
how
the
democratic
party
as
a
party
stood
this
doubt
was
conveniently
removed
by
representative
underwood
the
majority
leader
of
the
house
when
he
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house
the
following
day
the
democratic
party
last
night
took
the
distinctive
position
that
it
was
not
in
favor
of
this
legislation
because
it
was
in
favor
of
the
states
controlling
the
question
of
suffrage
i
not
only
said
i
was
opposed
to
it
but
i
said
the
party
on
this
side
of
the
chamber
was
opposed
to
it
and
the
party
that
has
control
of
the
legislation
in
congress
certainly
has
the
right
to
say
that
it
will
not
support
a
measure
if
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
its
principles
meanwhile
the
president
had
said
to
a
deputation
of
workingwomen
who
waited
upon
him
in
february
until
the
party
as
such
has
considered
a
matter
of
this
very
supreme
importance
and
taken
its
position
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
speak
for
it
and
yet
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
speak
for
it
as
an
individual
for
i
am
not
an
individual
but
we
ask
you
to
speak
to
your
party
not
for
it
answered
glendower
evans
chairman
of
the
deputation
amid
evident
presidential
embarrassment
those
women
who
had
been
inclined
perhaps
to
accept
the
president
words
as
true
to
fact
entertained
doubts
when
a
days
later
he
demanded
of
his
party
in
congress
the
repeal
of
the
free
tolls
provision
in
the
panama
canal
tolls
act
in
so
doing
he
not
only
recommended
action
not
endorsed
by
his
party
but
he
demanded
action
which
his
party
had
specifically
declared
against
it
was
necessary
to
appeal
again
to
the
nation
we
called
for
demonstrations
of
public
approval
of
the
amendment
in
every
state
on
may
thousands
of
resolutions
were
passed
calling
for
action
in
congress
these
resolutions
were
made
the
center
of
another
great
demonstration
in
washington
may
when
thousands
of
women
in
procession
carried
them
to
the
capitol
where
beautiful
and
impressive
ceremonies
were
held
on
the
capitol
steps
the
resolutions
were
formally
received
by
members
of
congress
and
the
demonstration
ended
dramatically
with
a
great
chorus
of
women
massed
on
the
steps
singing
the
march
of
the
women
to
the
thousands
of
spectators
packed
closely
together
on
the
capitol
grounds
and
still
the
president
withheld
his
support
under
our
auspices
five
hundred
representative
club
women
of
the
country
waited
upon
him
in
another
appeal
for
help
to
them
he
explained
his
passion
for
local
which
led
to
his
conviction
that
this
is
a
matter
for
settlement
by
the
states
and
not
by
the
federal
government
women
had
to
face
the
fact
that
the
congress
had
made
a
distinctly
hostile
record
on
suffrage
the
president
as
leader
of
his
party
had
seven
times
refused
all
aid
the
democratic
party
had
recorded
its
opposition
through
an
adverse
vote
in
the
senate
and
a
caucus
vote
in
the
house
forbidding
even
consideration
of
the
measure
it
became
clear
that
some
form
of
political
action
would
have
to
be
adopted
which
would
act
as
an
accelerator
to
the
administration
this
feeling
was
growing
momentarily
among
many
women
but
it
was
conspicuously
strong
in
the
mind
of
oliver
belmont
recognized
as
one
of
the
ablest
deputation
to
the
president
june
this
amounted
to
virtual
opposition
because
of
the
great
difficulties
some
of
them
almost
insuperable
involved
in
amending
many
state
constitutions
suffrage
leaders
in
the
country
anticipating
the
unfriendly
record
made
by
the
democrats
in
the
congress
belmont
had
come
to
miss
paul
and
to
her
miss
lucy
burns
to
urge
the
formulation
of
a
plan
whereby
we
could
strike
at
administration
opposition
through
the
women
voters
of
the
west
miss
paul
had
the
same
idea
and
welcomed
the
support
of
this
plan
by
so
able
a
leader
belmont
was
impatient
to
do
nationally
what
she
had
already
inaugurated
in
new
york
state
suffrage
suffrage
an
election
issue
she
was
the
first
suffragist
in
america
to
be
militant
enough
to
wage
a
campaign
against
on
the
issue
of
woman
suffrage
she
was
roundly
denounced
by
the
opposition
press
but
she
held
her
ground
it
is
interesting
to
record
that
she
defeated
the
first
candidate
for
the
new
york
assembly
ever
campaigned
against
on
this
issue
she
had
associated
herself
with
the
pankhursts
in
england
and
was
the
first
suffrage
leader
here
publicly
to
commend
the
tactics
of
the
english
militants
through
her
pankhurst
made
her
first
visits
to
america
where
she
found
a
sympathetic
audience
even
among
the
people
who
understood
and
believed
in
english
tactics
the
general
idea
here
was
that
only
in
the
backward
country
of
england
was
militancy
necessary
in
america
men
would
give
women
what
women
wanted
without
a
struggle
belmont
was
the
one
suffrage
leader
who
foresaw
a
militant
battle
here
whenever
women
should
determine
to
ask
for
their
freedom
immediately
in
a
great
measure
she
prepared
the
way
for
that
battle
since
the
movement
had
not
even
advanced
to
the
stage
of
political
action
at
that
time
however
belmont
realized
that
political
action
would
have
to
be
exhausted
before
attempting
more
aggressive
tactics
not
knowing
whether
miss
paul
had
contemplated
inaugurating
political
action
in
the
national
field
she
sought
out
the
new
leader
and
urged
her
to
begin
at
once
to
organize
the
women
power
for
use
in
the
approaching
national
elections
those
interested
in
the
woman
movement
are
fairly
familiar
with
belmont
early
state
suffrage
work
and
her
work
with
the
militants
in
england
but
they
do
not
know
as
much
about
her
national
work
it
is
not
easy
for
a
woman
of
vast
wealth
to
be
credited
with
much
else
in
america
than
the
fact
of
generosity
in
giving
money
to
the
cause
in
which
she
believes
wealth
dazzles
us
and
we
look
no
further
belmont
has
given
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
suffrage
both
state
and
national
but
she
has
given
greater
gifts
in
her
militant
spirit
her
political
sagacity
and
a
marked
tactical
sense
she
was
practically
the
only
leader
formerly
associated
with
the
conservative
forces
who
had
the
courage
to
extricate
herself
from
the
old
routine
propaganda
and
adventure
into
new
paths
she
always
approached
the
struggle
for
liberty
in
a
wholesome
revolutionary
mood
she
was
essentially
a
leader
and
one
who
believed
in
action
until
the
movement
in
america
regained
its
militant
spirit
her
heart
was
primarily
with
the
english
women
because
she
thought
their
fight
so
magnificent
that
it
would
bring
suffrage
to
women
in
england
sooner
than
our
methods
would
bring
it
to
us
in
when
english
militancy
was
at
its
height
belmont
gave
out
an
interview
in
london
in
which
she
predicted
that
english
women
would
have
the
suffrage
before
us
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
in
america
would
have
to
create
an
acute
situation
here
probably
a
form
of
militancy
before
we
could
win
at
the
same
time
the
president
of
the
international
suffrage
alliance
said
in
london
the
suffrage
movement
in
resembles
a
battle
it
is
cruel
and
tragic
ours
in
america
is
an
dramatic
slow
but
more
sure
facts
sustained
belmont
prophecy
facts
did
not
sustain
the
other
prediction
english
women
got
the
vote
in
american
women
were
not
enfranchised
nationally
until
august
the
following
is
the
political
theory
and
program
approved
by
belmont
and
submitted
to
the
congressional
union
by
its
chairman
alice
paul
at
a
conference
of
the
organization
at
the
home
of
belmont
in
newport
in
august
the
dominant
party
at
that
time
the
democratic
party
is
responsible
for
all
action
and
therefore
for
action
on
suffrage
this
party
action
had
been
hostile
to
this
measure
the
dominant
party
in
the
approaching
election
must
be
convinced
and
through
it
all
other
parties
that
opposition
to
suffrage
is
inexpedient
all
parties
will
be
convinced
when
they
see
that
their
opposition
costs
them
votes
our
fight
is
a
political
one
we
must
appeal
for
support
to
the
constituency
which
is
most
friendly
to
suffrage
that
constituency
being
the
voting
women
an
attempt
must
be
made
no
matter
how
small
to
organize
the
women
vote
an
appeal
must
be
made
to
the
women
voters
in
the
nine
suffrage
states
to
withhold
their
support
from
the
democrats
nationally
until
the
national
democratic
party
ceases
to
block
the
suffrage
amendment
this
is
in
the
highest
degree
as
it
calls
upon
women
to
forego
previous
allegiance
to
a
party
if
they
are
democrats
in
this
instance
they
must
vote
against
their
party
if
the
republican
party
were
in
power
and
pursued
a
similar
course
we
would
work
against
that
party
the
party
which
sees
votes
falling
away
will
change
its
attitude
after
we
have
once
affected
by
this
means
the
outcome
of
a
national
election
even
though
slightly
every
party
will
hesitate
to
trifle
with
our
measure
any
longer
all
candidates
from
suffrage
states
are
professing
suffragists
and
therefore
we
have
nothing
to
lose
by
defeating
a
member
of
the
dominant
party
in
those
states
another
suffragist
will
take
his
place
men
will
object
to
being
opposed
because
of
their
party
responsibility
in
spite
of
their
friendliness
individually
to
suffrage
but
women
certainly
have
a
right
to
further
through
the
ballot
their
wishes
on
the
suffrage
question
as
well
as
on
other
questions
like
currency
tariff
and
what
not
this
can
only
be
done
by
considering
the
party
record
for
as
the
individual
record
and
individual
pledges
go
all
candidates
are
practically
equal
we
as
a
disfranchised
class
consider
our
right
to
vote
preeminently
over
any
other
issue
in
any
party
program
political
leaders
will
resent
our
injecting
our
issue
into
their
campaign
but
the
rank
and
file
will
be
won
when
they
see
the
loyalty
of
women
to
women
this
policy
will
be
called
militant
and
in
a
sense
it
is
being
strong
positive
and
energetic
if
it
is
militant
to
appeal
to
women
to
use
their
vote
to
bring
suffrage
to
this
country
then
it
is
militant
to
appeal
to
men
or
women
to
use
their
vote
to
any
good
end
to
the
question
of
how
will
we
profit
if
another
party
comes
in
our
answer
will
be
that
adequate
political
chastisement
of
one
party
for
its
bad
suffrage
record
through
a
demonstration
of
power
by
women
voters
affecting
the
result
of
the
national
election
will
make
it
easier
to
get
action
from
any
party
in
power
amidst
tremendous
enthusiasm
this
plan
was
accepted
by
the
little
conference
of
women
at
newport
and
pledged
in
a
few
moments
to
start
it
there
was
a
small
group
of
women
an
infinitely
small
budget
with
which
to
wage
a
campaign
in
nine
states
but
here
was
also
enthusiasm
and
resolute
determination
a
tiny
handful
of
more
than
two
more
often
only
one
to
a
forth
from
washington
into
the
nine
suffrage
states
of
the
west
to
put
before
the
voting
women
this
political
theory
and
to
ask
them
to
support
it
chapter
women
voters
organize
it
ca
be
done
women
do
care
about
suffrage
i
once
they
got
it
it
is
a
dead
issue
to
talk
of
arousing
the
western
women
to
protest
against
the
congressional
candidates
of
the
national
democratic
party
in
the
suffrage
states
when
every
one
of
them
is
a
professing
suffragist
is
utter
folly
so
ran
the
comment
of
the
political
wise
acres
in
the
autumn
of
but
the
women
had
faith
in
their
appeal
it
is
impossible
to
give
in
a
few
words
any
adequate
picture
of
the
anger
of
democratic
leaders
at
our
entrance
into
the
campaign
six
weeks
before
election
they
woke
up
to
find
the
issue
of
national
suffrage
injected
into
a
campaign
which
they
had
meant
should
be
no
more
stirring
than
an
orderly
and
perfunctory
endorsement
of
the
president
legislative
program
the
campaign
became
a
very
hot
one
during
which
most
of
the
militancy
seemed
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
political
leaders
heavy
fists
came
down
on
desks
harsh
words
were
spoken
violent
threats
were
made
in
colorado
where
i
was
paigning
i
was
invited
politely
but
firmly
by
the
democratic
leader
to
leave
the
state
the
morning
after
i
had
arrived
you
can
do
no
good
here
i
would
advise
you
to
leave
at
once
besides
your
plan
is
impracticable
and
the
women
will
not
support
it
then
why
do
you
object
to
my
being
here
i
asked
you
have
no
right
to
ask
women
to
do
this
some
slight
variation
of
this
experience
was
met
by
every
woman
who
took
part
in
this
campaign
of
course
the
democratic
leaders
did
not
welcome
an
issue
raised
unexpectedly
and
one
which
forced
them
to
spend
an
endless
amount
of
time
apologizing
for
and
explaining
the
democratic
party
record
nor
did
they
relish
spending
more
money
publishing
more
literature
in
short
adding
greatly
to
the
burdens
of
their
campaign
the
candidates
a
little
more
suave
than
the
party
leaders
proved
most
eloquently
that
they
had
been
suffragists
from
birth
one
candidate
even
claimed
a
suffrage
inheritance
from
his
this
first
entry
of
women
into
a
national
election
on
the
suffrage
amendment
was
little
more
than
a
quick
brilliant
dash
with
all
its
sketchiness
however
it
had
immediate
political
results
and
when
the
election
was
over
there
came
tardily
a
general
public
recognition
that
the
congressional
union
had
made
a
real
contribution
to
these
results
in
the
nine
suffrage
states
women
for
members
of
congress
for
of
these
seats
the
democratic
party
ran
candidates
we
opposed
in
our
campaign
all
of
these
candidates
out
of
the
democratic
candidates
running
only
were
elected
while
it
was
not
our
primary
aim
to
defeat
candidates
it
was
generally
conceded
that
we
had
contributed
to
these
defeats
our
aim
in
this
campaign
was
primarily
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
public
the
bad
suffrage
record
of
the
democratic
party
the
effect
of
our
campaign
was
soon
evident
in
congress
the
most
backward
member
realized
for
the
first
time
that
women
had
voted
even
the
president
perceived
that
the
movement
had
gained
new
strength
though
he
was
not
yet
politically
moved
by
it
he
was
still
tied
to
a
conviction
which
he
had
had
all
his
life
that
suffrage
ought
to
be
brought
about
state
by
state
enough
strength
and
determination
among
women
had
statement
to
deputation
of
democratic
women
eighth
deputation
at
the
white
house
been
demonstrated
to
the
administration
however
to
make
them
want
to
do
something
just
as
good
as
the
thing
we
asked
the
resolution
was
introduced
providing
for
a
constitutional
amendment
permitting
a
national
initiative
and
referendum
on
suffrage
in
the
states
thereby
forcing
upon
women
the
very
course
we
had
sought
to
circumvent
this
red
herring
drawn
across
the
path
had
been
accepted
by
the
conservative
ragists
evidently
in
a
moment
of
hopelessness
and
their
strength
put
behind
it
but
the
politicians
who
persuade
them
to
back
it
knew
that
it
was
merely
an
attempt
to
evade
the
issue
this
made
necessary
a
tremendous
campaign
throughout
the
country
by
the
congressional
union
with
the
result
that
the
compromise
measure
was
eventually
abandoned
during
its
life
however
politicians
were
happy
in
the
opportunity
to
divide
their
support
between
it
and
the
original
amendment
which
was
still
pending
to
offset
this
danger
and
to
show
again
in
dramatic
fashion
the
strength
and
will
of
the
women
voters
to
act
on
this
issue
we
made
political
work
among
the
western
women
the
principal
effort
of
the
year
the
year
preceding
the
presidential
election
taking
advantage
of
the
exposition
in
san
francisco
we
opened
suffrage
headquarters
in
the
palace
of
education
on
the
exposition
grounds
from
there
we
called
the
first
woman
voters
convention
ever
held
in
the
world
for
the
single
purpose
of
attaching
political
strength
to
the
movement
belmont
was
chairman
of
the
committee
which
signed
the
convention
call
women
from
all
the
voting
states
assembled
in
a
mass
convention
september
and
there
is
not
time
to
describe
this
resolution
was
introduced
in
the
senate
by
senator
shafroth
of
colorado
democrat
in
the
house
by
representative
mitchell
palmer
of

in

both
men
although
avowed
supporters
of
the
original

backed
this
evil
compromise
the
beauty
of
the
pageantry
which
surrounded
that
gathering
nor
of
the
emotional
quality
which
was
at
high
pitch
throughout
the
sessions
these
women
from
the
deserts
of
arizona
from
the
farms
of
oregon
from
the
valleys
of
california
from
the
mountains
of
nevada
and
utah
were
in
deadly
earnest
they
had
answered
the
call
and
they
meant
to
stay
in
the
fight
until
it
was
won
the
convention
went
on
record
unanimously
for
further
political
action
on
behalf
of
national
suffrage
and
for
the
original
amendment
without
compromise
and
pledged
itself
to
use
all
power
to
this
end
without
regard
to
the
interests
of
any
existing
political
party
two
emissaries
sara
bard
field
and
frances
joliffe
both
of
california
were
commissioned
by
women
voters
at
the
final
session
when
more
than
ten
thousand
people
were
present
to
go
to
the
president
and
congress
bearing
these
resolutions
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
signatures
upon
a
petition
gathered
during
the
summer
they
would
speak
directly
to
the
president
lest
he
should
be
inclined
to
take
lightly
the
women
resolutions
the
envoys
symbolic
of
the
new
strength
that
was
to
come
out
of
the
west
made
their
journey
across
continent
by
automobile
they
created
a
sensation
all
along
the
way
received
as
they
were
by
governors
by
mayors
by
officials
high
and
low
and
by
the
populace
thousands
more
added
their
names
to
the
petition
and
it
was
rolled
up
to
gigantic
proportions
until
in
december
when
unrolled
it
literally
stretched
over
miles
as
it
was
borne
to
the
capitol
with
honor
escorts
the
action
of
the
convention
scarcely
cold
and
the
envoys
way
across
the
continent
the
president
hastened
to
new
jersey
to
cast
his
vote
for
suffrage
in
a
state
referendum
he
was
careful
to
state
that
he
did
so
as
a
private
citizen
not
as
the
leader
of
my
party
in
the
nation
he
repeated
his
position
putting
the
emphasis
upon
his
opposition
to
national
suffrage
rather
than
on
his
belief
in
suffrage
for
his
state
i
believe
that
it
suffrage
should
be
settled
by
the
states
and
not
by
the
national
government
and
that
in
no
circumstances
should
it
be
made
a
party
question
and
my
view
has
grown
stronger
at
every
turn
of
the
agitation
he
knew
women
were
asking
the
powerful
aid
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
not
the
aid
of
wilson
of
princeton
new
jersey
the
state
amendment
in
new
jersey
was
certain
to
fail
as
president
wilson
well
knew
casting
a
vote
for
it
would
help
his
case
with
women
voters
and
still
not
bring
suffrage
in
the
east
a
step
nearer
the
envoys
reception
at
the
capitol
was
indeed
dramatic
thousands
of
women
escorted
them
amid
bands
and
banners
to
the
halls
of
congress
where
they
were
received
by
senators
and
representatives
and
addressed
with
eloquent
speeches
the
envoys
replied
by
asking
that
their
message
be
carried
by
friends
of
the
measure
to
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
house
and
this
was
done
the
envoys
waited
upon
the
president
at
the
white
house
this
visit
of
the
representatives
of
women
with
power
marked
rather
an
advance
in
the
president
position
he
listened
with
an
eager
attention
to
the
story
of
the
power
and
what
women
meant
to
do
with
it
for
the
first
time
on
record
he
said
he
had
an
open
mind
on
the
question
of
national
suffrage
and
would
confer
with
his
party
colleagues
the
republican
and
democratic
national
committees
heard
the
case
of
the
envoys
they
were
given
a
hearing
before
the
senate
suffrage
committee
and
before
the
house
judiciary
in
one
of
the
most
lively
and
entertaining
inquisitions
in
which
women
ever
participated
no
more
questions
on
mother
and
home
no
swan
song
on
the
passing
of
charm
and
womanly
loveliness
only
agile
scrambling
by
each
committee
member
to
ask
with
eagerness
and
some
heat
well
if
this
amendment
has
not
passed
congress
by
then
what
will
you
do
in
the
elections
of
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
women
were
allowed
to
tell
their
story
so
eager
was
the
committee
to
jump
ahead
to
political
consequences
sirs
that
depends
upon
what
you
gentlemen
do
we
are
asking
a
simple
but
they
never
got
any
further
from
the
main
base
of
their
interest
if
president
wilson
comes
out
for
it
and
his
party
does
not
from
a
republican
member
will
i
object
to
introducing
partisan
discussions
here
came
shamelessly
from
a
democratic
colleague
and
so
the
hearing
passed
in
something
of
a
verbal
riot
but
with
no
doubt
as
to
the
fact
that
congressmen
were
alarmed
by
the
prospect
of
women
voting
as
a
protest
group
the
new
year
found
the
senate
promptly
reporting
the
measure
favorably
again
but
the
judiciary
committee
footballed
it
to
its
back
to
the
whole
committee
postponed
it
marked
time
dodged
defeated
it
the
problem
of
neutrality
toward
the
european
war
was
agitating
the
minds
of
political
leaders
nothing
like
suffrage
for
women
must
be
allowed
to
rock
the
ship
even
slightly
oh
no
indeed
it
was
men
business
to
keep
the
nation
out
of
war
men
never
had
shown
marked
skill
at
keeping
nations
out
of
war
in
the
history
of
the
world
but
never
mind
logic
must
not
be
pressed
too
hard
upon
the
reasoning
sex
this
time
men
would
do
it
the
exciting
national
election
contest
was
approaching
party
conventions
were
scheduled
to
meet
in
june
while
the
amendment
languished
at
the
capitol
it
was
clear
that
more
highly
organized
would
have
to
be
called
into
action
before
the
national
government
would
speed
its
pace
to
the
women
voters
the
eastern
women
went
for
decisive
assistance
a
car
known
as
the
suffrage
special
carrying
distinguished
eastern
women
and
gifted
speakers
made
an
extensive
tour
of
the
west
and
under
the
banner
of
the
congressional
union
called
again
upon
the
women
voters
to
come
to
chicago
on
june
to
form
a
new
party
woman
party
serve
as
long
as
should
be
necessary
as
the
balance
of
power
in
national
contests
and
thus
to
force
action
from
the
old
parties
the
instant
response
which
met
this
appeal
surpassed
the
most
optimistic
hopes
thousands
of
women
assembled
in
chicago
for
this
convention
which
became
not
only
in
suffrage
fight
but
in
the
whole
woman
movement
for
the
first
time
in
history
women
came
together
to
organize
their
political
power
into
a
party
to
free
their
own
sex
for
the
first
time
in
history
representatives
of
men
political
parties
came
to
plead
before
these
women
voters
for
the
support
of
their
respective
parties
the
republican
party
sent
as
its
representatives
john
hays
hammond
and
osborn
formerly
governor
of
michigan
the
democrats
sent
their
most
persuasive
orator
president
friend
dudley
field
malone
collector
of
the
port
of
new
york
allan
benson
candidate
for
the
presidency
on
the
socialist
ticket
represented
the
socialist
party
edward
polling
prohibition
leader
spoke
for
the
prohibition
party
arid
victor
murdock
and
gifford
pinchot
for
the
progressive
party
all
laid
their
claims
for
suffrage
support
before
the
women
with
the
result
that
the
convention
resolved
itself
into
another
political
woman
party
a
new
party
with
but
one
immediate
passage
of
the
federal
suffrage
party
determined
to
withhold
its
support
from
all
existing
parties
until
women
were
politically
free
and
to
punish
politically
any
party
in
power
which
did
not
use
its
the
woman
party
started
with
a
membership
of
all
congressional
union
members
in
suffrage
states
anne
martin
of
nevada
was
elected
chairman
power
to
free
women
a
party
which
became
a
potent
factor
of
protest
in
the
following
national
election
this
first
step
towards
the
solidarity
of
women
quickly
brought
results
the
republican
national
convention
meeting
immediately
after
the
woman
party
convention
and
the
democratic
national
convention
the
week
following
both
included
suffrage
planks
in
their
national
platforms
for
the
first
time
in
history
to
be
sure
they
were
planks
that
failed
to
satisfy
us
but
the
mere
hint
of
organized
political
action
on
suffrage
had
moved
the
two
dominant
parties
to
advance
a
step
the
new
woman
party
had
declared
suffrage
a
national
political
issue
the
two
major
parties
acknowledged
the
issue
by
writing
it
into
their
party
platforms
the
republican
platform
was
vague
and
indefinite
on
national
suffrage
the
democratic
party
made
its
suffrage
plank
specific
against
action
by
congress
it
precisely
said
we
recommend
the
extension
of
the
franchise
to
the
women
of
the
country
by
the
states
upon
the
same
terms
as
men
it
was
openly
stated
at
the
democratic
convention
by
leading
administration
democrats
that
the
president
himself
had
written
this
suffrage
plank
if
the
republicans
could
afford
to
write
a
vague
and
indefinite
plank
the
president
and
his
party
could
not
they
as
the
party
in
power
had
been
under
fire
and
were
forced
to
take
sides
they
did
so
the
president
chose
the
plank
and
his
subordinates
followed
his
lead
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
that
this
declaration
so
solidified
the
opposition
within
the
president
party
that
when
the
president
ultimately
sought
to
repudiate
it
he
met
stubborn
resistance
protected
by
the
president
plank
the
democratic
congress
continued
to
block
national
suffrage
it
would
not
permit
it
even
to
be
reported
from
the
judiciary
committee
the
party
platform
was
written
the
president
too
found
it
easy
to
hide
behind
the
plank
which
he
had
himself
written
counting
on
women
to
be
satisfied
to
hooker
of
richmond
virginia
who
as
a
delegate
from
the
virginia
federation
of
labor
representing
members
went
to
him
soon
after
to
ask
his
support
of
the
amendment
the
president
said
i
am
opposed
by
conviction
and
political
traditions
to
federal
action
on
this
question
moreover
after
the
plank
which
was
adopted
in
the
democratic
platform
at
louis
i
could
not
comply
with
the
request
contained
in
this
resolution
even
if
i
wished
to
do
so
president
wilson
could
not
act
because
the
party
plank
which
he
had
written
prevented
him
from
doing
so
meanwhile
the
women
continued
to
protest
miss
mabel
vernon
of
delaware
beloved
and
gifted
crusader
was
the
first
member
of
the
woman
party
to
commit
a
militant
act
president
wilson
speaking
at
the
dedication
services
of
the
labor
temple
in
washington
was
declaring
his
interest
in
all
classes
and
all
struggles
he
was
proclaiming
his
beliefs
in
the
abstractions
of
liberty
and
justice
when
miss
vernon
who
was
seated
on
the
platform
from
which
he
was
speaking
said
in
her
powerful
voice
president
if
you
sincerely
desire
to
forward
the
interests
of
all
the
people
why
do
you
oppose
the
national
enfranchisement
of
women
instant
consternation
arose
but
the
idea
had
penetrated
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
huge
assembly
that
women
were
protesting
to
the
president
against
the
denial
of
their
liberty
the
president
found
time
to
answer
that
is
one
of
the
things
which
we
will
have
to
take
counsel
over
later
and
resumed
his
speech
miss
vernon
repeated
her
question
later
and
was
ordered
from
the
meeting
by
the
police
as
the
summer
wore
on
women
realized
that
they
would
have
to
enter
the
national
contest
in
the
autumn
attention
was
focussed
on
the
two
rival
presidential
candidates
woodrow
wilson
and
charles
evans
hughes
the
republican
nominee
upon
whom
the
new
woman
party
worked
diligently
for
prompt
statements
of
their
position
on
the
national
amendment
the
next
political
result
of
the
new
solidarity
of
women
was
hughes
declaration
on
august
my
view
is
that
the
proposed
amendment
should
be
submitted
and
ratified
and
the
subject
removed
from
political
discussion
the
democratic
congress
adjourned
without
even
report
ing
the
measure
to
that
body
for
a
vote
and
went
forthwith
to
the
country
to
ask
reelection
we
also
went
to
the
country
we
went
to
the
women
voters
to
lay
before
them
again
the
democratic
party
record
now
complete
through
one
administration
we
asked
women
voters
again
to
withhold
their
support
nationally
from
president
wilson
and
his
party
the
president
accepted
at
once
the
opportunity
to
speak
before
a
convention
of
suffragists
at
atlantic
city
in
an
effort
to
prove
his
great
belief
in
suffrage
he
said
poetically
the
tide
is
rising
to
meet
the
moon
you
can
afford
to
wait
whatever
we
may
have
thought
of
his
figure
of
speech
we
disagreed
with
his
conclusion
the
campaign
on
democratic
speakers
throughout
the
west
found
an
unexpected
organized
force
among
women
demanding
an
explanation
of
the
past
conduct
of
the
democratic
party
and
insisting
on
an
immediate
declaration
by
the
president
in
favor
of
the
amendment
democratic
orators
did
their
utmost
to
meet
this
opposition
give
the
president
time
he
ca
do
everything
at
once
trust
him
once
more
he
will
do
it
for
you
next
term
he
kept
us
out
of
war
he
is
the
best
friend
the
mothers
of
the
nation
ever
had
he
stood
by
you
now
you
women
stand
by
him
what
good
will
votes
do
you
if
the
germans
come
over
here
and
take
your
country
and
so
on
enticing
doctrine
to
peace
lovers
of
the
human
race
although
we
entered
this
contest
with
more
strength
than
we
had
had
in
with
a
budget
five
times
as
large
and
with
evidence
of
democratic
hostility
we
could
rot
have
entered
a
more
difficult
contest
the
people
were
excited
to
an
almost
unprecedented
pitch
over
the
issue
of
peace
versus
war
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
competing
with
this
emotional
issue
which
meant
the
immediate
disposal
of
millions
of
lives
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
two
issues
were
running
almost
neck
and
neck
in
the
western
territory
no
less
skilled
a
campaigner
than
william
jennings
bryan
took
the
stump
in
the
west
against
the
woman
party
at
least
a
third
of
each
speech
was
devoted
to
suffrage
he
urged
he
exhorted
he
apologized
he
explained
he
pleaded
he
condemned
often
he
was
heckled
often
he
saw
huge
vote
against
wilson
he
kept
us
out
of
suffrage
banners
at
the
doors
of
his
meetings
one
woman
in
arizona
who
unable
longer
to
listen
in
patience
to
the
glory
of
a
democracy
where
only
were
governed
those
who
consented
interrupted
him
he
coldly
answered
madam
you
can
not
pick
cherries
before
they
are
ripe
by
the
time
he
got
to
california
however
the
cherries
had
ripened
considerably
for
bryan
came
out
publicly
for
the
national
amendment
what
was
true
of
bryan
was
true
of
practically
every
democratic
campaigner
against
their
wills
they
were
forced
to
talk
about
suffrage
although
they
had
serenely
announced
at
the
opening
of
the
campaign
that
it
was
not
an
issue
in
this
campaign
some
merely
apologized
and
explained
others
like
dudley
field
malone
spoke
for
the
federal
amendment
and
promised
to
work
to
put
it
through
the
next
congress
if
only
you
women
will
stand
by
wilson
and
return
him
to
power
space
will
not
permit
in
this
book
to
give
more
than
a
hint
of
the
scope
and
strength
of
our
campaign
if
it
were
possible
to
give
a
glimpse
of
the
speeches
made
by
men
in
that
paign
you
would
agree
that
it
was
not
peace
alone
that
was
the
dominant
issue
but
peace
and
suffrage
it
must
be
made
perfectly
clear
that
the
woman
party
did
not
attempt
to
elect
hughes
it
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
back
a
candidate
in
its
first
battle
and
did
not
conduct
its
fight
affirmatively
at
all
no
speeches
were
made
for
hughes
and
the
republican
party
the
appeal
was
to
vote
a
vote
of
protest
against
wilson
and
his
congressional
candidates
because
he
and
his
party
had
had
the
power
to
pass
the
amendment
through
congress
and
had
refused
to
do
so
that
left
the
women
free
to
choose
from
among
the
republicans
socialists
and
prohibitionists
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
main
strength
of
the
vote
taken
from
wilson
would
go
to
hughes
as
few
women
perhaps
threw
their
votes
to
the
minority
parties
but
just
as
the
progressive
party
protest
had
been
effective
in
securing
progressive
legislation
without
winning
the
election
so
the
woman
party
hoped
its
protest
would
bring
results
in
congress
without
attempting
to
win
the
election
history
will
never
know
in
round
numbers
how
many
women
voted
against
the
president
and
his
party
at
this
crisis
for
there
are
no
records
kept
for
men
and
women
separately
except
in
one
state
in
illinois
the
women
there
voted
two
to
one
against
wilson
and
for
hughes
men
outnumber
women
throughout
the
entire
western
territory
in
some
states
two
and
three
to
one
in
nevada
still
higher
but
whereas
in
the
election
of
president
wilson
got
electoral
votes
from
the
suffrage
states
in
the
election
when
the
whole
west
was
aflame
for
him
because
of
his
peace
policy
he
got
only
enthusiasm
for
hughes
in
the
west
was
not
sufficiently
marked
to
account
entirely
for
the
loss
of
these
electoral
votes
our
claim
that
democratic
opposition
to
suffrage
had
cost
many
of
them
was
never
seriously
denied
the
democratic
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
which
had
refused
to
report
suffrage
to
the
house
for
a
vote
had
only
one
democratic
member
from
a
suffrage
state
taggart
of
kansas
standing
for
reelection
this
was
the
only
spot
where
women
could
strike
out
against
the
action
of
this
taggart
they
struck
with
success
he
was
defeated
almost
wholly
by
the
women
votes
with
a
modest
campaign
fund
of
slightly
over
fifty
thousand
dollars
raised
almost
entirely
in
small
sums
the
women
had
forced
the
campaign
committee
of
the
democratic
party
to
assume
the
defensive
and
to
practically
double
expenditure
and
work
on
this
issue
as
much
literature
was
used
on
suffrage
as
on
peace
in
the
suffrage
states
many
democrats
although
hostile
to
our
campaign
said
without
qualification
that
the
woman
party
protest
was
the
only
factor
in
the
campaign
which
stemmed
the
western
tide
toward
wilson
and
which
finally
made
california
the
pivotal
state
and
left
his
election
in
doubt
for
a
week
again
with
more
force
national
suffrage
had
been
injected
into
a
campaign
where
it
was
not
wanted
where
the
leaders
had
hoped
the
single
issue
of
peace
would
hold
the
center
of
the
stage
again
many
women
had
stood
together
on
this
issue
and
put
woman
suffrage
first
and
the
actual
reelection
of
president
wilson
had
its
point
of
advantage
too
for
it
enabled
us
to
continue
the
education
of
a
man
in
power
who
had
already
had
four
years
of
lively
training
on
the
woman
question
chapter
the
last
deputation
to
president
wilson
of
the
hundreds
of
women
who
volunteered
for
the
last
western
campaign
perhaps
the
most
effective
in
their
appeal
were
the
disfranchised
eastern
women
the
most
dramatic
figure
of
them
all
was
inez
milholland
boissevain
the
gallant
and
beloved
crusader
who
gave
her
life
that
the
day
of
women
freedom
might
be
hastened
her
last
words
to
the
nation
as
she
fell
fainting
on
the
platform
in
california
were
president
how
long
must
women
wait
for
liberty
her
fiery
challenge
was
never
heard
again
she
never
recovered
from
the
terrific
strain
of
the
campaign
which
had
undermined
her
young
strength
her
death
touched
the
heart
of
the
nation
her
sacrifice
made
so
generously
for
liberty
lighted
anew
the
fire
of
rebellion
in
women
and
aroused
from
inertia
thousands
never
before
interested
in
the
liberation
of
their
own
sex
memorial
meetings
were
held
throughout
the
country
at
which
women
not
only
paid
radiant
tribute
to
inez
milholland
but
reconsecrated
themselves
to
the
struggle
and
called
again
upon
the
reelected
president
and
his
congress
to
act
the
most
impressive
of
these
memorials
was
held
on
christmas
day
in
washington
in
statuary
hall
under
the
dome
of
the
scene
of
memorial
services
for
lincoln
and
with
statues
of
outstanding
figures
in
the
struggle
for
political
and
religious
liberty
in
this
country
the
first
memorial
service
ever
held
in
the
capitol
to
honor
a
woman
was
held
for
this
gallant
young
leader
boy
choristers
singing
the
magnificent
hymn
forward
through
the
darkness
leave
behind
the
night
forward
out
of
error
forward
into
light
led
into
the
hall
the
procession
of
young
girl
garbed
in
simple
surplices
carrying
their
crusading
banners
high
above
their
heads
these
comrades
of
inez
milholland
boissevain
seemed
more
triumphant
than
sad
they
seemed
to
typify
the
spirit
in
which
she
gave
her
life
still
other
young
girls
in
white
held
great
golden
banners
flanking
the
dais
from
which
could
be
read
the
inscriptions
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
he
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friend
without
extinction
is
liberty
without
retrograde
is
equality
as
he
died
to
make
men
holy
let
us
die
to
make
men
free
from
behind
the
heavy
velvet
curtains
came
the
music
of
voices
and
strings
and
the
great
organ
sounded
its
tragic
and
triumphant
tones
miss
maud
younger
of
california
was
chosen
to
make
the
memorial
address
on
this
occasion
she
said
in
part
we
are
here
to
pay
tribute
to
inez
milholland
boissevain
who
was
our
comrade
we
are
here
in
the
nation
capital
the
seat
of
our
democracy
to
pay
tribute
to
one
who
gave
up
her
life
to
realize
that
democracy
inez
milholland
walked
down
the
path
of
life
a
radiant
being
she
went
into
work
with
a
song
in
her
heart
she
went
into
battle
with
a
laugh
on
her
lips
obstacles
inspired
her
discouragement
urged
her
on
she
loved
work
and
she
loved
battle
she
loved
life
and
laughter
and
light
and
above
all
else
she
loved
liberty
with
a
loveliness
beyond
most
a
kindliness
a
beauty
of
mind
and
soul
she
typified
always
the
best
and
noblest
in
womanhood
she
was
the
flaming
torch
that
went
ahead
to
light
the
symbol
of
light
and
freedom
symbol
of
the
woman
struggle
it
was
she
who
carried
to
the
west
the
appeal
of
the
unenfranchised
and
carrying
it
made
her
last
appeal
on
earth
her
last
journey
in
life
as
she
set
out
upon
her
last
journey
she
seems
to
have
had
the
clearer
vision
the
spiritual
quality
of
one
who
has
already
set
out
for
another
world
with
infinite
understanding
and
intense
faith
in
her
mission
she
was
as
one
inspired
her
meetings
were
described
as
meetings
her
audiences
as
with
enthusiasm
thousands
acclaimed
her
thousands
were
turned
away
unable
to
enter
and
she
made
her
message
very
plain
she
stood
for
no
man
no
party
she
stood
only
for
woman
and
standing
thus
she
urged
is
women
for
women
now
and
shall
be
until
the
fight
is
won
together
we
shall
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
for
the
greatest
principle
the
world
known
the
right
of
the
party
that
has
ignored
the
claims
of
women
we
as
women
must
refuse
to
uphold
it
we
must
refuse
to
uphold
any
party
until
all
women
are
free
have
nothing
but
our
spirits
to
rely
on
and
the
vitality
of
our
faith
but
spirit
is
invincible
is
only
for
a
little
while
soon
the
fight
will
be
over
victory
is
in
sight
though
she
did
not
live
to
see
that
victory
it
is
sweet
to
know
that
she
lived
to
see
her
faith
in
women
justified
in
one
of
her
last
letters
she
wrote
only
did
we
reckon
accurately
on
women
loyalty
to
women
but
we
likewise
realized
that
our
appeal
touched
a
certain
spiritual
idealistic
quality
in
the
western
woman
voter
a
quality
which
is
yearning
to
find
expression
in
political
life
at
the
idealism
of
the
woman
party
her
whole
nature
flames
into
enthusiasm
and
her
response
is
immediate
she
gladly
transforms
a
narrow
partisan
loyalty
into
loyalty
to
a
principle
the
establishment
of
which
carries
with
it
no
personal
advantage
to
its
advocate
but
merely
the
satisfaction
of
achieving
one
more
step
toward
the
emancipation
of
mankind
we
are
bound
to
win
there
never
has
been
a
fight
yet
where
interest
was
pitted
against
principle
that
principle
did
not
triumph
the
trip
was
fraught
with
hardship
speaking
day
and
night
she
would
take
a
train
at
two
in
the
morning
to
arrive
at
eight
then
a
train
at
midnight
to
arrive
at
five
in
the
morning
yet
she
would
not
change
the
program
she
would
not
leave
anything
out
and
so
her
life
went
out
in
glory
in
the
shining
cause
of
freedom
and
as
she
had
lived
loving
liberty
working
for
liberty
fighting
for
liberty
so
it
was
that
with
this
word
on
her
lips
she
fell
long
must
women
wait
for
liberty
she
cried
and
surely
as
any
soldier
upon
the
field
of
truly
as
any
who
ever
gave
up
his
life
for
an
ideal
as
in
life
she
had
been
the
symbol
of
the
woman
cause
so
in
death
she
is
the
symbol
of
its
sacrifice
the
whole
daily
sacrifice
the
pouring
out
of
life
and
strength
that
is
the
toll
of
woman
prolonged
struggle
inez
milholland
is
one
around
whom
legends
will
grow
up
generations
to
come
will
point
out
mount
inez
and
tell
of
the
beautiful
woman
who
sleeps
her
last
sleep
on
its
slopes
they
will
tell
of
her
in
the
west
tell
of
the
vision
of
loveliness
as
she
flashed
through
on
her
last
burning
mission
flashed
through
to
her
falling
star
in
the
western
heavens
but
neither
legend
nor
vision
is
liberty
which
was
her
life
liberty
can
not
die
no
work
for
liberty
can
be
lost
it
lives
on
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
in
their
hopes
their
tions
their
activities
it
becomes
part
of
the
life
of
the
nation
what
inez
milholland
has
given
to
the
world
lives
on
forever
we
are
here
to
pay
tribute
to
inez
milholland
boissevain
who
was
our
comrade
let
our
tribute
be
not
words
which
pass
nor
song
which
flies
nor
flower
which
fades
let
it
be
this
that
we
finish
the
task
she
could
not
finish
that
with
new
strength
we
take
up
the
struggle
in
which
fighting
beside
us
she
fell
that
with
new
faith
we
here
consecrate
ourselves
to
the
cause
of
woman
freedom
until
that
cause
is
won
that
with
new
devotion
we
go
forth
inspired
by
her
sacrifice
to
the
end
that
her
sacrifice
be
not
in
vain
for
dying
she
shall
bring
to
pass
that
which
living
she
could
not
achieve
women
full
democracy
for
the
nation
let
this
be
our
tribute
imperishable
to
inez
milholland
boissevain
miss
anne
martin
of
nevada
chairman
of
the
woman
party
presided
over
the
services
other
speakers
were
honorable
george
sutherland
united
states
senator
from
utah
representing
the
united
states
congress
and
honorable
rowland
mahany
former
member
of
congress
and
lifelong
friend
of
the
milholland
family
william
kent
of
california
wife
of
representative
kent
presented
two
resolutions
which
the
vast
audience
approved
by
silently
rising
one
resolution
a
tribute
of
rare
beauty
prepared
by
zona
gale
a
friend
of
inez
milholland
was
a
compelling
appeal
to
all
women
to
understand
and
to
reverence
the
ideals
of
this
inspiring
leader
the
other
was
an
appeal
to
the
administration
for
action
the
pageantry
of
surpliced
choristers
and
the
long
line
of
girl
retired
to
the
strains
of
the
solemn
recessional
the
great
audience
sat
still
with
bowed
heads
as
the
voices
in
the
distance
dropped
in
silence
instantly
the
strains
of
the
marseillaise
filling
the
great
dome
with
its
stirring
and
martial
song
of
hope
were
taken
up
by
the
organ
and
the
strings
and
the
audience
was
lifted
to
its
feet
singing
as
if
in
anticipation
of
the
triumph
of
liberty
the
women
were
in
no
mood
merely
to
mourn
the
loss
of
a
leader
the
government
must
be
shown
again
its
share
of
responsibility
another
appeal
must
be
made
to
the
president
who
growing
steadily
in
control
over
the
people
and
over
his
congress
was
the
one
leader
powerful
enough
to
direct
his
party
to
accept
this
reform
but
he
was
busy
gathering
his
power
to
lead
them
elsewhere
again
we
would
have
to
compete
with
sentiment
but
it
was
no
time
to
relax
following
the
holiday
season
a
deputation
of
over
three
hundred
women
carried
to
the
white
house
the
christmas
day
memorial
for
inez
milholland
and
other
memorials
from
similar
services
the
president
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
new
protest
of
women
against
the
continued
waste
of
physical
and
spiritual
energy
in
their
battle
there
is
no
better
way
to
picture
the
protest
than
to
give
you
something
verbatim
from
the
speeches
made
that
memorable
day
this
was
the
first
meeting
of
suffragists
with
the
president
since
the
campaign
against
him
in
the
previous
autumn
it
was
only
because
of
the
peculiar
character
of
the
appeal
that
he
consented
to
hear
them
miss
younger
presented
the
national
memorial
to
him
and
introduced
john
winters
brannan
who
made
no
plea
to
the
president
but
merely
gave
him
the
new
york
memorial
which
read
as
follows
this
gathering
of
men
and
women
assembled
on
new
year
day
in
new
york
to
hold
a
memorial
service
in
honor
of
inez
milholland
boissevain
appeals
to
you
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
end
the
outpouring
of
life
and
effort
that
has
been
made
for
the
enfranchisement
of
women
for
more
than
seventy
years
in
this
country
the
death
of
this
lovely
and
brave
women
symbolizes
the
whole
daily
sacrifice
that
vast
numbers
of
women
have
made
and
are
making
for
the
sake
of
political
freedom
it
has
made
vivid
the
unnoticed
tragedy
of
this
prolonged
effort
for
a
freedom
that
is
acknowledged
just
but
still
denied
it
is
not
given
to
all
to
be
put
to
the
supreme
test
and
to
accept
that
test
with
such
gallant
gladness
as
she
did
the
struggle
however
has
reached
the
point
where
it
requires
such
intensity
of
and
the
whole
vast
country
that
the
health
of
thousands
of
noble
women
is
being
insidiously
undermined
if
this
continues
and
it
will
continue
until
victory
is
won
we
know
only
too
surely
that
many
women
whom
the
nation
can
ill
spare
will
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
inez
milholland
we
desire
to
make
known
to
you
president
our
deep
sense
of
wrong
being
inflicted
upon
women
in
making
them
spend
their
health
and
strength
and
forcing
them
to
abandon
other
work
that
means
fuller
in
order
to
win
freedom
under
a
government
that
professes
to
believe
in
democracy
there
is
only
one
cause
for
which
it
is
right
to
risk
health
and
life
no
price
is
too
high
to
pay
for
liberty
so
long
as
lives
of
women
are
required
these
lives
will
be
given
but
we
beg
of
you
president
so
to
act
that
this
ghastly
price
will
not
have
to
be
paid
certainly
it
is
a
grim
irony
that
a
republic
should
exact
it
upon
you
at
this
moment
rests
a
solemn
responsibility
for
with
you
it
rests
to
decide
whether
the
life
of
this
brilliant
woman
whose
glorious
death
we
commemorate
shall
be
the
last
sacrifice
of
fife
demanded
of
american
women
in
their
struggle
for
we
ask
you
with
all
the
fervor
and
earnestness
of
our
souls
to
exert
your
power
over
congress
in
behalf
of
the
national
enfranchisement
of
women
in
the
same
way
you
have
so
successfully
used
it
on
other
occasions
and
for
far
less
important
measures
we
are
confident
that
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
decides
that
this
act
of
justice
shall
be
done
in
the
present
session
of
congress
it
will
be
done
we
know
further
that
if
the
president
does
not
urge
it
it
will
not
be
done
a
fraction
of
a
moment
of
silence
follows
but
it
is
long
enough
to
feel
strongly
the
emotional
state
of
mind
of
the
president
it
plainly
irritates
him
to
be
so
plainly
spoken
to
we
are
conscious
that
his
distant
poise
on
entering
is
dwindling
to
petty
confusion
there
is
something
inordinately
cool
about
the
fervor
of
the
women
this
too
irritates
him
his
irritation
only
serves
to
awaken
in
every
woman
new
strength
it
is
a
wonderful
experience
to
feel
strength
take
possession
of
your
being
in
a
contest
of
ideas
no
amount
of
trappings
no
amount
of
authority
no
number
of
plainclothes
men
nor
the
glamour
of
the
attaches
nor
the
vastness
of
the
great
reception
hall
nor
the
dazzle
of
the
lighted
crystal
chandeliers
and
above
all
not
the
mind
of
your
opponent
can
cut
in
on
your
slim
hard
strength
you
are
more
than
invincible
your
mind
leaps
ahead
to
the
infinite
liberty
of
which
yours
is
only
a
small
part
you
feel
his
strength
in
authority
his
weakness
in
vision
he
does
not
follow
he
feels
sorrow
for
us
he
patronizes
us
he
must
temper
his
irritation
at
our
undoubted
fanaticism
and
unreason
we
on
the
other
hand
feel
so
superior
to
him
our
strength
to
demand
is
so
much
greater
than
his
power
to
withhold
but
he
does
not
perceive
this
in
the
midst
of
these
currents
the
serene
and
appealing
voice
of
sara
bard
field
came
as
a
temporary
relief
to
the
only
temporary
shy
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
women
as
she
said
in
presenting
the
california
memorial
resolutions
president
a
year
ago
i
had
the
honor
of
calling
upon
you
with
a
similar
deputation
at
that
time
we
brought
from
my
western
country
a
great
petition
from
the
voting
women
urging
your
assistance
in
the
passage
of
the
federal
amendment
for
suffrage
at
that
time
you
were
most
gracious
to
us
you
showed
yourself
to
be
in
line
with
all
the
progressive
leaders
by
your
statement
to
us
that
you
could
change
your
mind
and
would
consider
doing
so
in
connection
with
this
amendment
we
went
away
that
day
with
hope
in
our
hearts
but
neither
the
hope
inspired
by
your
friendly
words
nor
the
faith
we
had
in
you
as
an
advocate
of
democracy
kept
us
from
working
day
and
night
in
the
interest
of
our
cause
since
that
day
when
we
came
to
you
president
one
of
our
most
beautiful
and
beloved
comrades
inez
milholland
has
paid
the
price
of
her
life
for
this
cause
the
untimely
death
of
a
young
woman
like
woman
for
whom
the
world
has
such
bitter
focussed
the
attention
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
nation
on
the
fearful
waste
of
women
which
this
fight
for
the
ballot
is
entailing
the
same
maternal
instinct
for
the
preservation
of
it
be
the
physical
life
of
a
child
or
the
spiritual
life
of
a
cause
is
sending
women
into
this
battle
for
liberty
with
an
urge
which
gives
them
no
rest
night
or
day
every
advance
of
liberty
has
demanded
its
quota
of
human
sacrifice
but
if
i
had
time
i
could
show
you
that
we
have
paid
in
a
measure
that
is
running
over
in
the
light
of
inez
milholland
death
as
we
look
over
the
long
backward
trail
through
which
we
have
sought
our
political
liberty
we
are
asking
how
long
must
this
struggle
go
on
president
to
the
nation
more
than
to
women
alone
is
this
waste
of
maternal
force
significant
in
industry
such
a
waste
of
money
and
strength
would
not
be
permitted
the
modern
trend
is
all
toward
efficiency
why
is
such
waste
permitted
in
the
making
of
a
nation
sometimes
i
think
it
must
be
very
hard
to
be
a
president
in
respect
to
his
contacts
with
people
as
well
as
in
the
great
business
he
must
perform
the
exclusiveness
necessary
to
a
great
dignitary
holds
him
away
from
that
democracy
of
communion
necessary
to
a
full
understanding
of
what
the
people
really
thinking
and
desiring
i
feel
that
this
deputation
fails
in
its
mission
if
because
of
the
dignity
of
your
office
and
the
formality
of
such
an
occasion
we
fail
to
bring
you
the
throb
of
woman
desire
for
freedom
and
her
eagerness
to
ally
herself
when
once
the
ballot
is
in
her
hand
with
all
those
activities
to
which
you
yourself
have
dedicated
your
life
those
tasks
which
this
nation
has
set
itself
to
do
are
her
tasks
as
well
as
man
we
women
who
are
here
are
close
to
this
desire
of
women
we
can
not
believe
that
you
are
our
enemy
or
indifferent
to
the
fundamental
righteousness
of
our
demand
we
have
come
here
to
you
in
your
powerful
office
as
our
helper
we
have
come
in
the
name
of
justice
in
the
name
of
democracy
in
the
name
of
all
women
who
have
fought
and
died
for
this
cause
and
in
a
peculiar
way
with
our
hearts
bowed
in
sorrow
in
the
name
of
this
gallant
girl
who
died
with
the
word
on
her
lips
we
have
come
asking
you
this
day
to
speak
some
favorable
word
to
us
that
we
may
know
that
you
will
use
your
good
and
great
office
to
end
this
wasteful
struggle
of
women
the
highest
point
in
the
interview
had
been
reached
before
the
president
began
his
reply
we
were
aware
that
the
high
moment
had
gone
but
we
listened
ladies
i
had
not
been
apprised
that
you
were
coming
here
to
make
any
representations
that
would
issue
an
appeal
to
me
i
had
been
told
that
you
were
coming
to
present
memorial
resolutions
with
regard
to
the
very
remarkable
woman
whom
your
cause
has
lost
i
therefore
am
not
prepared
to
say
anything
further
than
i
have
said
on
previous
occasions
of
this
sort
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
where
my
own
convictions
and
my
own
personal
purpose
lie
and
i
need
not
tell
you
by
what
circumscriptions
i
am
bound
as
leader
of
a
party
as
the
leader
of
a
party
my
commands
come
from
that
party
and
not
from
private
personal
convictions
my
personal
action
as
a
citizen
of
course
comes
from
no
source
but
my
own
conviction
and
therefore
my
position
has
been
so
frequently
defined
and
i
hope
so
candidly
defined
and
it
is
so
impossible
for
me
until
the
orders
of
my
party
are
changed
to
do
anything
other
than
i
am
doing
as
a
party
leader
that
i
think
nothing
more
is
necessary
to
be
said
i
do
want
to
say
this
i
do
not
see
how
anybody
can
fail
to
observe
from
the
utterances
of
the
last
campaign
that
the
democratic
party
is
more
inclined
than
the
opposition
to
assist
in
this
great
cause
and
it
has
been
a
matter
of
surprise
to
me
and
a
matter
of
very
great
regret
that
so
many
of
those
who
were
heart
and
soul
for
this
cause
seemed
so
greatly
to
misunderstand
arid
misinterpret
the
attitude
of
parties
in
this
country
as
in
every
other
country
it
is
really
through
the
instrumentality
of
parties
that
things
can
be
accomplished
they
are
not
accomplished
by
the
individual
voice
but
by
concerted
action
and
that
action
must
come
only
so
fast
as
you
can
concert
it
i
have
done
my
best
and
shall
continue
to
do
my
best
to
concert
it
in
the
interest
of
a
cause
in
which
i
personally
believe
dead
silence
the
president
stands
for
a
brief
instant
at
the
end
of
his
words
as
if
waiting
for
some
faint
stir
of
approval
which
does
not
come
he
has
the
baffled
air
of
a
appointed
actor
who
has
failed
to
get
across
then
he
turns
abruptly
on
his
heel
and
the
great
doors
swallow
him
up
silently
the
women
file
through
the
corridor
and
into
the
fresh
air
the
women
returned
to
the
spacious
headquarters
across
the
park
all
of
one
mind
how
little
the
president
knew
about
women
how
he
underestimated
their
intelligence
and
penetration
of
things
political
was
it
possible
that
he
really
thought
these
earnest
champions
of
liberty
would
merely
carry
resolutions
of
sorrow
and
regret
to
the
president
but
this
was
not
the
real
irony
how
lightly
he
had
shifted
the
responsibility
for
getting
results
to
his
party
with
what
coldness
he
had
bade
us
concert
opinion
a
thing
which
he
alone
could
do
that
was
pretty
hard
to
bear
coming
as
it
did
when
countless
forms
of
appeal
had
been
by
which
women
without
sufficient
power
could
concert
anything
the
movement
was
almost
at
the
point
of
languishing
so
universal
was
the
belief
in
the
nation
that
suffrage
for
women
was
inevitable
and
yet
he
and
his
party
remained
immovable
the
three
hundred
women
of
the
memorial
deputation
became
on
their
return
to
headquarters
a
spirited
protest
meeting
plans
of
action
in
the
event
the
president
refused
to
help
had
been
under
consideration
by
miss
paul
and
her
executive
committee
for
some
time
but
they
were
now
presented
for
the
first
time
for
approval
there
was
never
a
more
dramatic
moment
at
which
to
ask
the
women
if
they
were
ready
for
drastic
action
harriot
stanton
blatch
daughter
of
elizabeth
cady
stanton
and
a
powerful
leader
of
women
voiced
the
feeling
of
the
entire
body
when
she
said
in
a
ringing
call
for
action
we
have
gone
to
congress
we
have
gone
to
the
president
during
the
last
four
years
with
great
deputations
with
small
deputations
we
have
shown
the
interest
all
over
the
country
in
for
that
the
president
as
a
great
democrat
ought
to
understand
and
respond
to
instantly
yet
he
tells
us
that
we
must
win
his
party
he
said
it
was
strange
that
we
did
not
see
before
election
that
his
party
was
more
favorable
to
us
than
the
republican
party
how
did
it
show
its
favor
how
did
he
show
his
favor
today
to
us
he
says
we
have
got
to
convert
his
party
why
never
before
did
the
democratic
party
lie
more
in
the
hands
of
one
man
than
it
lies
in
the
hands
of
president
wilson
never
did
the
democratic
party
have
a
greater
leader
and
never
was
it
more
susceptible
to
the
wish
of
that
leader
than
is
the
democratic
party
of
to
president
wilson
he
controls
his
party
and
i
do
think
he
is
too
modest
to
know
it
he
can
mould
it
as
he
wishes
and
he
has
moulded
it
he
moulded
it
quickly
before
election
in
the
matter
of
the
law
was
that
in
his
party
platform
he
had
to
crush
and
force
his
party
to
pass
that
measure
yet
he
is
not
willing
to
lay
a
finger
weight
on
his
party
for
half
the
people
of
the
united
states
yet
he
tells
us
that
we
must
wait
more
we
ca
organize
bigger
and
more
influential
deputations
we
ca
organize
bigger
processions
we
ca
women
do
anything
more
in
that
line
we
have
got
to
take
a
new
departure
we
have
got
to
keep
the
question
before
him
all
the
time
we
have
got
to
begin
and
begin
immediately
women
it
rests
with
us
we
have
got
to
bring
to
the
president
individually
day
by
day
week
in
and
week
out
the
idea
that
great
numbers
of
women
want
to
be
free
wall
be
free
and
want
to
know
what
he
is
going
to
do
about
it
wo
you
come
and
join
us
in
standing
day
after
day
at
the
gates
of
the
white
house
with
banners
asking
will
you
do
president
for
the
people
of
this
nation
stand
there
as
of
liberty
sentinels
of
sentinels
let
us
stand
beside
the
gateway
where
he
must
pass
in
and
out
so
that
he
can
never
fail
to
realize
that
there
is
a
tremendous
earnestness
and
insistence
back
of
this
measure
will
you
not
show
your
allegiance
today
to
this
ideal
of
liberty
will
you
not
be
a
silent
sentinel
of
liberty
and
deliberations
continued
details
were
settled
three
thousand
dollars
was
raised
in
a
few
minutes
among
these
women
fresh
from
the
president
rebuff
no
one
suggested
waiting
until
the
next
presidential
campaign
no
one
even
mentioned
the
fact
that
time
was
precious
and
we
could
wait
no
longer
every
one
seemed
to
feel
these
things
without
troubling
to
put
them
into
words
volunteers
signed
up
for
sentinel
duty
and
the
fight
was
on
part
iii
militancy
will
write
a
song
for
the
president
full
of
menacing

and

chapter
picketing
a
president
when
all
suffrage
controversy
has
died
away
it
will
be
the
little
army
of
women
with
their
purple
white
and
gold
banners
going
to
prison
for
their
political
freedom
that
will
be
remembered
they
dramatized
to
victory
the
long
suffrage
fight
in
america
the
challenge
of
the
picket
line
roused
the
government
out
of
its
sleep
of
indifference
it
stirred
the
country
to
hot
controversy
it
made
zealous
friends
and
violent
enemies
it
produced
the
contest
which
forced
the
surrender
of
the
government
in
the
second
administration
of
president
wilson
the
day
following
the
memorial
deputation
to
the
president
january
the
first
line
of
sentinels
a
dozen
in
number
appeared
for
duty
at
the
white
house
gates
in
retrospect
it
must
seem
to
the
most
inflexible
person
a
reasonably
mild
and
gentle
thing
to
have
done
but
at
the
same
time
it
caused
a
profound
stir
columns
of
front
page
space
in
all
the
newspapers
of
the
country
gave
more
or
less
dispassionate
accounts
of
the
main
facts
women
carrying
banners
were
standing
quietly
at
the
white
house
gates
picketing
the
president
women
wanted
president
wilson
to
put
his
power
behind
the
suffrage
amendment
in
congress
that
did
not
seem
so
shocking
and
only
a
few
editors
broke
out
into
hot
condemnation
when
however
the
women
went
back
on
the
picket
line
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
the
next
it
began
to
dawn
upon
the
excited
press
that
such
persistence
was
undesirable
unwomanly
dangerous
gradually
the
people
most
hostile
to
the
idea
of
suffrage
in
any
form
marshaled
forth
the
fears
which
accompany
every
departure
from
the
prescribed
path
partisan
democrats
frowned
partisan
republicans
chuckled
the
rest
remained
in
cautious
silence
to
see
how
others
would
take
it
following
the
refrain
of
the
press
the
grew
louder
silly
women
unsexed
pathological
they
must
be
crazy
do
they
know
anything
about
politics
what
can
wilson
do
he
does
not
have
to
sign
the
constitutional
amendment
so
ran
the
comment
from
the
wise
elderly
gentlemen
sitting
buried
in
their
cushioned
chairs
at
the
gentlemen
club
across
the
park
watching
eagerly
the
shocking
shameless
women
at
the
gates
of
the
white
house
no
wonder
these
gentlemen
found
the
pickets
irritating
this
absorbing
topic
of
conversation
we
are
told
shattered
many
an
otherwise
quiet
afternoon
and
broke
up
many
a
quiet
game
here
were
american
women
before
their
very
eyes
daring
to
shock
them
into
having
to
think
about
liberty
and
what
was
for
women
ah
well
this
could
not
go
on
insult
to
the
president
they
could
with
impunity
condemn
him
and
gossip
about
his
affairs
but
that
women
should
stand
at
his
gates
asking
for
liberty
that
was
a
sin
without
mitigation
disapproval
was
not
confined
merely
to
the
gentlemen
in
their
club
i
merely
mention
them
as
an
example
for
they
were
our
neighbors
and
the
strain
on
them
day
by
day
as
our
beautiful
banners
floated
gaily
out
from
our
headquarters
was
i
am
told
a
heavy
one
yet
of
course
we
enjoyed
irritating
them
standing
on
the
icy
pavement
on
a
damp
wintry
day
in
the
penetrating
cold
of
a
washington
winter
knowing
that
within
a
stone
throw
of
our
agony
there
was
a
greater
agony
than
ours
there
was
a
joy
in
that
there
were
faint
rumblings
also
in
congress
but
like
so
many
of
its
feelings
they
were
confined
largely
to
the
cloak
rooms
representative
emerson
of
ohio
did
demand
from
the
floor
of
the
house
that
the
suffrage
guard
be
withdrawn
as
it
is
an
insult
to
the
president
but
his
protest
met
with
no
response
whatever
from
the
other
members
his
oratory
fell
on
indifferent
ears
and
of
course
there
were
always
those
in
congress
who
got
a
vicarious
thrill
watching
women
do
in
their
fight
what
they
themselves
had
not
the
courage
to
do
in
their
own
another
representative
an
democrat
inconsiderately
called
us
angels
and
hoped
we
would
retire
but
if
by
these
protests
these
congressmen
hoped
to
arouse
their
colleagues
they
failed
we
were
standing
at
the
gates
of
the
white
house
because
the
american
congress
had
become
so
supine
that
it
could
not
or
would
not
act
without
being
compelled
to
act
by
the
dent
they
knew
that
if
they
howled
at
us
it
would
only
afford
an
opportunity
to
retort
very
well
then
if
you
do
not
like
us
at
the
gates
of
your
leader
if
you
do
not
want
us
to
the
president
end
this
agitation
by
taking
the
matter
into
your
own
hands
and
passing
the
amendment
such
a
gestion
would
be
almost
as
severe
a
shock
as
our
picketing
the
thought
of
actually
initiating
legislation
left
a
loyal
cratic
follower
transfixed
the
heavy
dignity
of
the
senate
forbade
their
meddling
much
in
this
controversy
over
tactics
also
they
were
more
interested
in
the
sporting
prospect
of
our
going
into
the
world
war
there
was
no
appeal
to
in
the
women
fight
there
were
no
shining
rods
of
steel
there
was
no
martial
music
we
were
not
pledging
precious
lives
and
vast
billions
in
our
crusade
for
liberty
the
beginning
of
our
fight
did
indeed
seem
tiny
and
frail
by
the
side
of
the
big
game
of
war
and
so
the
senators
were
at
first
scarcely
aware
of
our
presence
but
the
intrepid
women
stood
their
long
vigils
day
by
day
at
the
white
house
gates
through
biting
wind
and
driving
rain
through
sleet
and
snow
as
well
as
sunshine
waiting
for
the
president
to
act
above
all
the
challenges
of
their
banners
rang
this
simple
but
insistent
one
president
how
long
must
women
wait
for
liberty
the
royal
blaze
of
purple
white
and
party
tricolored
a
gorgeous
spot
of
color
against
the
bare
blacklimbed
trees
there
were
all
kinds
of
pickets
and
so
there
were
all
kinds
of
reactions
to
the
experience
of
picketing
the
beautiful
lady
who
drove
up
in
her
limousine
to
do
a
twenty
minute
turn
on
the
line
found
it
thrilling
no
doubt
the
winter
tourist
who
had
read
about
the
pickets
in
her
home
paper
thought
it
would
be
so
exciting
to
hold
a
banner
for
a
few
minutes
but
there
were
no
illusions
in
the
hearts
of
the
women
who
stood
at
their
posts
day
in
and
day
out
none
of
them
will
tell
you
that
they
felt
exalted
ennobled
exhilarated
possessed
of
any
rare
and
exotic
emotion
they
were
human
beings
before
they
were
pickets
their
reactions
were
those
of
any
human
beings
called
upon
to
set
their
teeth
doggedly
and
hang
on
to
an
unpleasant
job
when
will
that
woman
come
to
relieve
me
i
have
stood
here
an
hour
and
a
half
and
my
feet
are
like
blocks
of
ice
was
a
more
frequent
comment
from
picket
to
picket
than
is
it
glorious
to
stand
here
defiantly
no
matter
what
the
stupid
people
say
about
us
i
remember
the
thousand
and
one
engaging
things
that
would
come
to
my
mind
on
the
picket
line
it
seemed
that
anything
but
standing
at
a
president
gate
would
be
more
diverting
but
there
we
stood
and
what
were
the
reflections
of
a
president
as
he
saw
the
indomitable
little
army
at
his
gates
we
can
only
venture
to
say
from
events
which
happened
at
first
he
seemed
amused
and
interested
perhaps
he
thought
it
a
trifling
incident
staged
by
a
minority
of
the
extreme
left
among
suffragists
and
anticipated
no
popular
support
for
it
when
he
saw
their
persistence
through
a
cruel
winnter
his
sympathy
was
touched
he
ordered
the
guards
to
invite
them
in
for
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
which
they
declined
he
raised
his
hat
to
them
as
he
drove
through
the
line
sometimes
he
smiled
as
yet
he
was
not
irritated
he
was
fortified
in
his
national
power
with
the
country
entrance
into
the
war
and
his
immediate
elevation
to
world
leadership
the
pickets
began
to
be
a
serious
thorn
in
his
flesh
his
own
statements
of
faith
in
democracy
and
the
necessity
for
establishing
it
the
world
left
him
open
to
attack
his
refusal
to
pay
the
just
bill
owed
the
women
and
demanded
by
them
brought
irritation
what
would
you
do
if
you
owed
a
just
bill
and
every
day
some
one
stood
outside
your
gates
as
a
quiet
reminder
to
the
whole
world
that
you
had
not
paid
it
you
would
object
you
would
get
terribly
irritated
you
would
call
the
insistent
one
all
kinds
of
harsh
names
you
might
even
arrest
him
but
the
scandal
would
be
out
rightly
or
wrongly
your
sincerity
would
be
touched
faith
in
you
would
be
shaken
a
bit
perhaps
even
against
your
will
you
would
yield
but
you
would
yield
and
that
was
the
one
important
fact
to
the
women
this
daily
sight
inspiring
gallant
and
impressive
escaped
no
visitor
to
the
national
capital
distinguished
visitors
from
the
far
corners
of
the
earth
passed
by
the
pickets
on
those
days
which
made
history
thousands
read
the
compelling
messages
on
the
banners
and
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
learned
the
story
when
the
visitors
got
back
home
real
displeasure
over
the
sentinels
by
those
who
passed
was
negligible
there
was
some
mirth
and
joking
but
the
vast
majority
were
filled
with
admiration
either
silent
or
expressed
keep
it
up
you
are
on
the
right
track
congratulations
i
certainly
admire
your
to
it
and
you
will
get
it
this
last
from
a
military
officer
it
is
an
outrage
that
you
women
should
have
to
stand
here
and
beg
for
your
rights
we
gave
it
to
our
women
in
australia
long
ago
this
from
a
charming
gentleman
who
bowed
approvingly
often
a
lifted
hat
was
held
in
sincere
reverence
over
the
heart
as
some
courteous
gentleman
passed
along
the
picket
line
of
course
there
were
some
who
came
to
try
to
argue
with
the
pickets
who
attempted
to
dissuade
them
from
their
persistent
course
but
the
serene
good
humor
and
even
temper
of
the
women
would
not
allow
heated
arguments
to
break
in
on
the
military
precision
of
their
line
if
a
question
was
asked
a
picket
would
answer
quietly
an
occasional
sneer
was
easy
to
meet
that
required
no
acknowledgment
a
sweet
old
veteran
of
the
civil
war
said
to
one
of
my
comrades
yous
all
right
you
got
ta
fight
for
your
rights
in
this
world
and
now
that
we
are
about
to
plunge
into
another
war
i
want
to
tell
you
women
there
be
no
end
to
it
unless
you
women
get
power
we
ca
save
ourselves
and
we
need
you
i
am
years
old
and
i
have
watched
this
fight
since
i
was
a
young
man
anything
i
can
do
to
help
i
want
to
do
i
am
living
at
the
old
soldiers
home
and
i
ai
got
mach
money
but
here
something
for
your
campaign
it
all
i
got
and
god
bless
you
got
ta
win
he
spoke
the
last
sentence
almost
with
desperation
as
he
shoved
a
crumpled
bill
into
her
hand
his
spirit
made
it
a
precious
gift
cabinet
members
passed
and
repassed
congressmen
by
the
hundreds
came
and
went
administration
leaders
tried
to
conceal
under
an
artificial
indifference
their
sensitiveness
to
our
strategy
and
domestic
battles
were
going
on
inside
the
homes
throughout
the
country
for
women
were
coming
from
every
state
in
the
union
to
take
their
place
on
the
line
for
the
first
time
good
were
made
uncomfortable
had
they
not
always
believed
in
suffrage
had
they
not
always
been
uncomplaining
when
their
wife
time
was
given
to
suffrage
campaigning
had
they
not
in
short
been
good
sports
about
the
whole
thing
there
was
only
one
answer
they
had
but
it
had
been
proved
that
all
the
things
that
women
had
done
and
all
the
things
in
which
their
menfolk
had
cooperated
were
not
enough
women
were
called
upon
for
more
intensive
action
you
can
not
go
to
washington
and
risk
your
health
standing
in
front
of
the
white
house
i
can
not
have
it
but
the
time
has
come
when
we
have
to
take
risks
of
health
or
anything
else
well
then
if
you
must
know
i
do
believe
in
it
now
i
am
a
reasonable
man
and
i
have
stood
by
you
all
the
way
up
to
now
but
i
object
to
this
it
is
ladylike
and
it
will
do
the
cause
more
harm
than
good
you
women
lay
yourselves
open
to
ridicule
that
just
a
fine
beginning
as
soon
as
men
get
tired
laughing
at
us
they
will
do
something
more
about
it
they
find
our
campaign
so
amusing
before
long
but
i
protest
you
no
right
to
go
without
considering
me
but
if
your
country
called
you
in
a
fight
for
democracy
as
it
is
likely
to
do
at
any
moment
you
go
would
you
why
of
course
of
course
you
would
you
would
go
to
the
front
and
leave
me
to
struggle
on
as
best
i
could
without
you
that
is
the
way
you
would
respond
to
your
country
call
whether
it
was
a
righteous
cause
or
not
well
i
am
going
to
the
front
too
i
am
going
to
answer
the
women
call
to
fight
for
democracy
i
would
be
ashamed
of
myself
if
i
were
not
willing
to
join
my
comrades
i
am
sorry
that
you
object
but
if
you
will
just
put
yourself
in
my
place
you
will
see
that
i
can
not
do
otherwise
it
must
be
recorded
that
there
were
exceptional
men
of
sensitive
imaginations
who
urged
women
against
their
own
hesitancy
they
are
the
handful
who
gave
women
a
hope
that
they
would
not
always
have
to
struggle
alone
for
their
liberation
and
women
passed
by
the
daily
picket
line
as
spectators
not
as
participants
occasionally
a
woman
came
forward
to
remonstrate
but
more
often
women
were
either
too
shy
to
advance
or
so
enthusiastic
that
nothing
could
restrain
them
the
more
of
them
inspired
by
the
dauntless
pickets
in
the
midst
of
a
now
freezing
temperature
brought
mittens
fur
pieces
golashes
wool
raincoats
hot
bricks
to
stand
on
coffee
in
thermos
bottles
and
what
not
meanwhile
the
pickets
became
a
household
word
in
washington
and
very
soon
were
the
subject
of
animated
conversation
in
practically
every
corner
of
the
nation
the
press
cartoonists
by
their
friendly
and
satirical
comments
helped
a
great
deal
in
popularizing
the
campaign
in
spite
of
the
bitter
editorial
comment
of
most
of
the
press
the
humor
of
the
situation
had
an
almost
universal
appeal
at
the
washington
dinner
of
the
gridiron
club
probably
the
best
known
press
club
in
the
world
a
dinner
at
which
president
wilson
was
a
guest
of
the
songs
sung
for
his
benefit
was
as
follows
we
camping
on
the
white

grounds
give
us
a
rousing
cheer
our
golden
flag
we
hold
aloft
of
cops
we
have
no
fear
many
of
the
pickets
are
weary
wishing
for
the
war
to
cease
many
are
the
chilblains
and
bites
too
it
is
no
life
of
ease
camping

camping

the

police
on
duty
at
the
gates
came
to
treat
the
picketers
as
comrades
i
was
kinds
worried
confessed
one
burly
officer
when
the
pickets
were
five
minutes
late
one
day
we
thought
perhaps
you
were
coming
and
we
world
have
to
hold
down
this
place
alone
the
among
the
opponents
of
suffrage
broke
into
such
violent
criticism
that
they
won
new
friends
to
the
amendment
people
who
had
never
before
thought
of
suffrage
for
women
had
to
think
of
it
if
only
to
the
extent
of
objecting
to
the
way
in
which
we
asked
for
it
people
who
had
thought
a
little
about
suffrage
were
compelled
to
think
more
about
it
people
who
had
believed
in
suffrage
all
their
lives
but
had
never
done
a
stroke
of
work
for
it
began
to
make
speeches
about
it
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
condemning
us
some
politicians
who
had
voted
for
it
when
there
were
not
enough
votes
to
carry
the
measure
loudly
threatened
to
commit
political
suicide
by
withdrawing
their
support
but
it
was
easy
to
see
at
a
glance
that
they
would
not
dare
to
run
so
great
a
political
risk
on
an
issue
growing
daily
more
important
as
soon
as
the
regular
picket
line
began
to
be
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
we
undertook
to
touch
it
up
a
bit
to
sustain
public
interest
state
days
were
inaugurated
beginning
with
maryland
the
other
states
took
up
the
idea
with
enthusiasm
there
was
a
college
day
when
women
representing
american
colleges
stood
on
the
line
a
teachers
day
which
found
the
long
line
represented
by
almost
every
state
in
the
union
and
a
patriotic
day
when
american
flags
mingled
with
the
banners
carried
by
representatives
of
the
women
reserve
corps
daughters
of
the
revolution
and
other
patriotic
organizations
and
there
were
professional
days
when
women
doctors
lawyers
and
nurses
joined
the
picket
appeal
lincoln
birthday
anniversary
saw
another
new
feature
a
long
line
of
women
took
out
banners
bearing
the
slogans
lincoln
stood
for
woman
suffrage
years
ago
president
why
do
you
block
the
national
suffrage
amendment
why
are
you
behind
lincoln
and
another
after
the
civil
war
women
asked
for
political
freedom
they
were
told
to
wait
this
was
the
negro
hour
in
american
women
still
ask
for
freedom
will
you
president
tell
them
to
this
is
the
porto
ricans
hour
a
huge
labor
demonstration
on
the
picket
line
late
in
february
brought
women
wage
earners
from
office
and
factory
throughout
the
eastern
states
a
special
susan
anthony
day
on
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
that
great
pioneer
served
to
remind
the
president
who
said
you
can
afford
to
wait
that
the
women
had
been
waiting
and
fighting
for
this
legislation
to
pass
congress
since
the
year
more
than
one
person
came
forward
to
speak
with
true
religious
fervor
of
the
memory
of
the
great
susan
anthony
her
name
is
never
mentioned
nor
her
words
quoted
without
finding
such
a
response
in
the
face
of
heavy
snow
and
rain
dozens
of
young
women
stood
in
line
holding
special
banners
made
for
this
occasion
thousands
of
men
and
women
streaming
home
from
work
in
the
early
evening
read
words
of
hers
spoken
during
the
civil
president
wilson
had
just
advocated
for
porto
rican
men
war
so
completely
applicable
to
the
policy
of
the
young
bearers
at
the
gates
we
press
our
demand
for
the
ballot
at
this
time
in
no
narrow
capious
or
selfish
spirit
but
from
purest
patriotism
for
the
highest
good
of
every
citizen
for
the
safety
of
the
republic
and
a
glorious
example
to
the
nations
of
the
earth
at
this
time
our
greatest
need
is
not
men
o
money
valiant
generals
or
brilliant
victories
but
a
consistent
national
policy
based
upon
the
principle
that
all
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
the
right
of
for
of
its
people
is
of
far
more
vital
consequence
to
the
nation
than
any
or
all
other
questions
during
the
reunion
week
of
the
daughters
and
veterans
of
the
confederacy
the
picket
line
was
the
center
of
attraction
for
the
veterans
and
their
families
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
troops
of
the
confederacy
had
crossed
the
potomac
and
taken
possession
of
the
capital
city
the
streets
were
lined
with
often
tottering
but
still
gallant
old
men
whitehaired
and
stooped
wearing
their
faded
badges
on
their
gray
uniforms
and
carrying
their
tattered
flags
it
seemed
to
the
young
women
on
picket
duty
during
those
days
that
not
a
single
veteran
had
failed
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
pickets
they
came
and
came
and
some
brought
back
their
wives
to
show
them
the
guard
at
the
gates
one
old
soldier
with
tears
in
his
dim
eyes
came
to
say
done
sentinel
duty
in
my
time
i
know
what
it
is
and
now
it
your
turn
you
young
folks
have
the
strength
and
the
courage
to
keep
it
up
you
are
going
to
put
it
through
one
sweet
old
alabamian
came
shyly
up
to
one
of
the
pickets
and
said
i
say
miss
this
is
the
white
house
is
it
before
she
could
answer
he
added
we
went
three
times
around
the
place
and
i
told
the
boys
the
big
white
house
in
the
center
was
the
white
house
but
they
was
believing
me
and
i
sure
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
girls
coming
with
your
flags
to
stand
here
i
said
must
be
the
white
house
this
is
sure
enough
where
the
president
lives
here
are
the
pickets
with
their
banners
that
we
read
about
down
home
a
note
of
triumph
was
in
his
frail
voice
the
picket
smiled
and
thanked
him
warmly
as
he
finished
with
you
are
brave
girls
you
are
bound
to
get
him
pointing
his
shaking
finger
toward
the
white
house
president
wilson
second
inauguration
was
rapidly
approaching
also
war
clouds
were
gathering
with
all
the
increased
emotionalism
that
comes
at
such
a
crisis
some
additional
demonstration
of
power
and
force
must
be
made
before
the
president
inauguration
and
before
the
excitement
of
our
entry
into
the
war
should
plunge
our
agitation
into
obscurity
this
was
the
strategic
moment
to
assemble
our
forces
in
convention
in
washington
accordingly
the
congressional
union
for
woman
suffrage
and
the
woman
party
that
section
of
the
congressional
union
in
suffrage
states
made
up
of
women
voters
convened
in
washington
and
decided
unanimously
to
unite
their
strength
money
and
political
power
in
one
organization
and
called
it
the
national
woman
party
the
following
officers
were
unanimously
elected
to
direct
the
activities
of
the
new
organization

the
convention
came
to
a
close
on
the
eve
of
inauguration
culminating
in
the
dramatic
picket
line
made
up
of
one
thousand
delegates
who
sought
an
interview
with
the
president
the
purpose
of
the
interview
was
to
carry
to
him
the
resolutions
of
the
convention
and
further
plead
with
him
to
open
his
second
administration
with
a
promise
to
back
the
amendment
in
our
optimism
we
hoped
that
this
glorified
might
form
a
climax
to
our
three
months
of
picketing
the
president
admired
persistence
he
said
so
he
also
said
he
appreciated
the
rare
tenacity
shown
by
our
women
surely
now
he
would
be
convinced
no
more
worrying
persistence
would
be
needed
the
combined
political
strength
of
the
western
women
and
the
financial
strength
of
the
eastern
women
would
surely
command
his
respect
and
entitle
us
to
a
hearing
what
actually
happened
it
was
a
day
of
high
wind
and
stinging
icy
rain
that
march
when
a
thousand
women
each
bearing
a
banner
struggled
against
the
gale
to
keep
their
banners
erect
it
is
always
impressive
to
see
a
thousand
people
march
but
the
impression
was
imperishable
when
these
thousand
women
marched
in
garments
hands
bare
gloves
roughly
torn
by
the
sticky
varnish
from
the
banner
poles
and
the
streams
of
water
running
down
the
poles
into
the
palms
of
their
hands
it
was
a
sight
to
impress
even
the
most
hardened
spectator
who
had
seen
all
the
various
forms
of
the
suffrage
agitation
in
washington
for
more
than
two
hours
the
women
circled
the
white
rain
never
ceasing
for
an
hoping
to
the
last
moment
that
at
least
their
leaders
would
be
allowed
to
take
in
to
the
president
the
resolutions
which
they
were
carrying
long
before
the
appointed
hour
for
the
march
to
start
thousands
of
spectators
sheltered
by
umbrellas
and
raincoats
lined
the
streets
to
watch
the
procession
two
bands
whose
men
managed
to
continue
their
spirited
music
in
spite
of
the
driving
rain
led
the
march
playing
forward
be
our
watchword
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
onward
christian
soldiers
the
chorus
from
tannhauser
the
coronation
march
from
le
prophete
the
russian
hymn
and
the
marsellaise
miss
vida
milholland
led
the
procession
carrying
her
last
words
president
how
long
must
women
wait
for
liberty
she
was
followed
by
miss
beulah
amidon
of
north
dakota
who
carried
the
banner
that
the
beloved
inez
milholland
carried
in
her
first
suffrage
procession
in
new
york
the
long
line
of
women
fell
in
behind
most
extraordinary
precautions
had
been
taken
about
the
white
house
everything
had
been
done
except
the
important
thing
there
were
almost
as
many
police
officers
as
marchers
the
washington
force
had
been
augmented
by
a
baltimore
contingent
and
squads
of
plainclothes
men
on
every
fifty
feet
of
curb
around
the
entire
white
house
grounds
there
was
a
about
the
same
distance
apart
on
the
inside
of
the
tall
which
surrounds
the
grounds
were
as
many
more
we
proceeded
to
the
main
gate
locked
i
was
marshalling
at
the
head
of
the
line
and
so
heard
first
hand
what
passed
between
the
leaders
and
the
guards
miss
anne
martin
addressed
the
guard
we
have
come
to
present
some
important
resolutions
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
have
orders
to
keep
the
gates
locked
but
there
must
be
some
mistake
surely
the
president
does
not
mean
to
refuse
to
see
at
least
those
are
my
only
orders
the
procession
continued
on
to
the
second
gate
on
pennsylvania
avenue
again
locked
before
we
could
address
the
somewhat
nervous
policeman
who
stood
at
the
gates
he
hastened
to
say
you
ca
come
in
here
the
gates
are
locked
but
it
is
imperative
we
are
a
thousand
women
from
all
states
in
the
union
who
have
come
all
the
way
to
washington
to
see
the
president
and
lay
before
him
no
orders
the
line
made
its
way
to
the
third
and
last
gate
the
gate
leading
to
the
executive
offices
as
we
came
up
to
this
gate
a
small
army
of
grinning
clerks
and
secretaries
manned
the
windows
of
the
executive
offices
evidently
amused
at
the
sight
of
the
women
struggling
in
the
wind
and
rain
to
keep
their
banners
intact

leaders
at
the
gate
determined
to
get
results
from
the
guard
while
the
women
continued
to
circle
the
white
house
will
you
not
carry
a
message
to
the
president
secretary
asking
him
to
tell
the
president
that
we
are
here
waiting
to
see
him
ca
do
that
will
you
then
take
our
cards
to
the
secretary
to
the
president
merely
announcing
to
him
that
we
are
here
so
that
he
may
send
somebody
to
carry
in
our
resolutions
still
the
guard
hesitated
finally
he
left
the
gate
and
carried
the
message
a
distance
of
a
few
rods
into
the
executive
offices
he
had
scarcely
got
inside
when
he
rushed
back
to
his
post
when
we
sought
to
ascertain
what
had
happened
to
the
they
been
given
and
what
the
answer
quietly
confided
to
us
that
he
had
been
reprimanded
for
even
attempting
to
bring
them
in
and
informed
us
that
the
cards
were
still
in
his
pocket
i
have
orders
to
answer
no
questions
and
to
carry
no
messages
if
you
have
anything
to
leave
here
you
might
take
it
to
the
entrance
below
the
executive
offices
i
go
off
my
beat
at
six
i
will
leave
it
as
i
go
by
the
white
house
we
examined
this
last
entrance
suggested
it
did
not
strike
us
as
the
proper
place
to
leave
an
important
message
for
the
president
what
is
this
entrance
used
for
i
asked
the
guard
it
all
right
lady
if
you
got
something
you
like
to
leave
leave
it
with
me
it
will
be
safe
i
retorted
that
we
were
not
seeking
safety
for
our
message
but
speed
in
delivery
the
guard
continued
this
is
the
gate
where
clothes
and
other
packages
are
left
it
struck
us
as
scarcely
fitting
that
we
should
leave
our
resolutions
amongst
wilson
clothes
and
other
packages
so
we
returned
to
the
last
locked
gate
to
ask
the
guard
if
he
had
any
message
in
the
meantime
for
us
he
shook
his
head
regretfully
meanwhile
the
women
marched
and
marched
and
the
rain
fell
harder
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
cold
seemed
almost
unendurable
the
grandmothers
in
the
were
some
as
old
as
as
energetic
as
the
young
girls
of
what
was
this
immediate
hardship
compared
to
eternal
subjection
women
marched
and
and
marched
under
the
sting
of
the
biting
elements
and
under
the
worse
sting
of
the
indignities
heaped
upon
them
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
in
democratic
america
they
could
not
see
the
president
to
lay
before
him
their
grievance
it
was
only
when
they
saw
the
presidential
limousine
in
the
late
afternoon
roll
luxuriously
out
of
the
grounds
and
through
the
gates
down
pennsylvania
avenue
that
the
weary
marchers
realized
that
president
wilson
had
deliberately
turned
them
away
unheard
the
car
for
an
instant
as
it
came
through
the
gates
divided
the
on
march
president
and
wilson
looked
straight
ahead
as
if
the
long
line
of
purple
white
and
gold
were
invisible
all
the
women
who
took
part
in
that
march
will
tell
you
what
was
burning
in
their
hearts
on
that
dreary
day
even
if
reasons
had
been
they
were
reasons
why
the
president
could
not
see
them
it
would
not
have
cooled
the
women
heat
their
passionate
resentment
went
deeper
than
any
reason
could
possibly
have
gone
this
one
single
incident
probably
did
more
than
any
other
to
make
women
sacrifice
themselves
even
something
as
thin
as
diplomacy
on
the
part
of
president
wilson
might
have
saved
him
many
restless
hours
to
follow
but
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
exercise
even
that
the
women
returned
to
headquarters
and
there
wrote
a
letter
which
was
dispatched
with
the
resolutions
to
president
wilson
in
a
letter
to
the
national
woman
party
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
them
he
concluded
by
saying
may
i
not
once
more
express
my
sincere
interest
in
the
cause
of
woman
suffrage
three
months
of
picketing
had
not
been
enough
we
must
not
only
continue
on
duty
at
his
gates
but
also
at
the
gates
of
congress
chapter
the
suffrage
war
policy
president
wilson
called
the
war
session
of
the
congress
on
april
on
the
opening
day
of
congress
not
only
were
the
pickets
again
on
duty
at
the
white
house
but
another
picket
line
was
inaugurated
at
the
capitol
returning
senators
and
congressmen
were
surprised
when
greeted
with
great
golden
banners
reading
russia
and
england
are
enfranchising
their
women
in
how
long
must
american
women
wait
for
their
liberty
the
last
desperate
flurries
in
the
and
camps
were
focused
on
the
capitol
grounds
that
day
there
swarmed
about
the
grounds
and
through
the
buildings
pacifists
from
all
over
the
country
wearing
white
badges
and
advocates
of
war
wearing
the
national
colors
our
sentinels
at
the
capitol
stood
strangely
silent
and
almost
aloof
strong
in
their
dedication
to
democracy
while
the
peace
and
war
agitation
circled
about
them
with
lightning
speed
the
president
declared
that
a
state
of
war
existed
within
a
fortnight
following
congress
declared
war
on
germany
and
president
wilson
voiced
his
memorable
we
shall
fight
for
the
things
we
have
always
carried
nearest
our
hearts
for
the
right
of
those
who
submit
to
authority
to
have
a
voice
in
their
own
government
ing
words
indeed
the
war
message
concluded
with
still
another
defense
of
the
fight
for
political
liberty
to
such
a
task
we
can
dedicate
our
lives
and
our
fortunes
everything
that
we
are
and
everything
that
we
have
with
the
pride
of
those
who
know
that
the
day
has
come
when
america
is
privileged
to
spend
her
blood
and
her
might
for
the
principles
that
gave
her
birth
and
happiness
and
the
peace
which
she
has
treasured
god
helping
her
she
can
do
no
less
now
that
the
united
states
was
actually
involved
in
war
we
were
face
to
face
with
the
question
which
we
had
considered
at
the
convention
the
previous
month
when
war
was
rumored
as
to
what
position
we
as
an
organization
should
take
in
this
situation
the
atmosphere
of
that
convention
had
been
dramatic
in
the
extreme
most
of
the
delegates
assembled
had
been
approached
either
before
going
to
washington
or
upon
arriving
and
urged
to
use
their
influence
to
persuade
the
organization
to
abandon
its
work
for
the
freedom
of
women
and
turn
its
activities
into
war
channels
although
war
was
then
only
rumored
the
hysterical
attitude
was
already
prevalent
women
were
asked
to
furl
their
banners
and
give
up
their
half
century
struggle
for
democracy
to
forget
the
liberty
that
was
most
precious
to
their
hearts
the
president
will
turn
this
imperialistic
war
into
a
crusade
for
democracy
lay
aside
your
own
fight
and
help
us
crush
germany
and
you
will
find
yourselves
rewarded
with
a
vote
out
of
the
nation
gratitude
were
some
of
the
appeals
made
to
our
women
by
government
officials
high
and
low
and
by
the
rank
and
file
of
men
and
women
never
in
history
did
a
band
of
women
stand
together
with
more
sanity
and
greater
solidarity
than
did
these
delegates
representing
thousands
more
throughout
the
states
as
our
official
organ
the
suffragist
pointed
out
editorially
in
its
issue
of
april
our
membership
was
made
up
of
women
who
had
banded
together
to
secure
political
freedom
for
women
we
were
united
on
no
other
subject
some
would
offer
passive
resistance
to
the
war
others
would
become
devoted
followers
of
a
vigorous
military
policy
between
these
every
shade
of
opinion
was
represented
each
was
loyal
to
the
ideas
which
she
held
for
her
country
with
the
character
of
these
various
ideals
the
national
woman
party
we
maintained
had
nothing
to
do
it
was
concerned
only
with
the
effort
to
obtain
for
women
the
opportunity
to
give
effective
expression
through
political
power
to
their
ideals
whatever
they
might
be
the
thousand
delegates
present
at
the
convention
though
differing
widely
on
the
duty
of
the
individual
in
war
were
unanimous
in
voting
that
in
the
event
of
war
the
national
woman
party
as
an
organization
should
continue
to
work
for
political
liberty
for
women
and
for
that
alone
believing
as
the
convention
stated
in
its
resolutions
that
in
so
doing
the
organization
serves
the
highest
interest
of
the
country
they
were
also
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
all
service
which
individuals
wished
to
give
to
war
or
peace
should
be
given
through
groups
organized
for
such
purposes
and
not
through
the
woman
party
a
body
created
according
to
its
constitution
for
one
purpose
to
secure
an
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
enfranchising
women
we
declared
officially
through
our
organ
that
this
held
as
the
policy
of
the
woman
party
whatever
turn
public
events
may
take
very
few
days
after
we
were
put
upon
a
national
war
basis
it
became
clear
that
never
was
there
greater
need
of
work
for
internal
freedom
in
the
country
europe
then
approaching
her
third
year
of
war
was
increasing
democracy
in
the
midst
of
the
terrible
conflict
in
america
at
that
very
moment
women
were
being
told
that
no
attempt
at
electoral
reform
had
any
place
in
the
country
program
until
the
war
is
over
the
crats
met
in
caucus
and
decided
that
only
war
measures
should
be
included
in
the
legislative
program
and
announced
that
no
subjects
would
be
considered
by
them
unless
the
president
urged
them
as
war
measures
our
task
was
from
that
time
on
to
make
national
suffrage
a
war
measure
we
at
once
urged
upon
the
administration
the
wisdom
of
accepting
this
proposed
reform
as
a
war
measure
and
pointed
out
the
difficulty
of
waging
a
war
for
democracy
abroad
while
democracy
was
denied
at
home
but
the
government
was
not
willing
to
profit
by
the
experience
of
its
allies
in
extending
suffrage
to
women
without
first
offering
a
terrible
and
brutal
resistance
we
must
confess
that
the
problem
of
dramatizing
our
fight
for
democracy
in
competition
with
the
drama
of
a
was
most
perplexing
here
were
we
citizens
without
power
and
recognition
with
the
only
weapons
to
which
a
powerless
class
which
does
not
take
up
arms
can
resort
we
could
not
and
would
not

banner
a

perhaps
pertinent
to

political

but
still
only
a
banner
inscribed
with
militant
truth
just
as
our
political
strategy
had
been
to
oppose
at
elections
the
party
in
power
which
had
failed
to
use
its
power
to
free

now
our
military
strategy
was
based
on
the
military
doctrine
of

on

weakest
point
to

the
weakest
point
in
the
administration
political
lines
during
the
war
was
the
inconsistency
between
a
crusade
for
world
democracy
and
the
denial
of
democracy
at
home
this
was
the
untenable
position
of
president
wilson
and
the
democratic
administration
from
which
we
must
force
them
to
retreat
we
could
force
such
a
retreat
when
we
had
exposed
to
the
world
this
weakest
point
just
as
the
bluff
of
a
democratic
crusade
must
be
called
so
must
the
of
the
crusade
be
exposed
to
the
critical
eyes
of
the
world
here
was
the
president
suddenly
elevated
to
the
position
of
a
world
leader
with
the
almost
pathetic
trust
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
here
was
the
champion
of
their
democratic
aspirations
here
was
a
kind
of
universal
moses
expected
to
lead
all
peoples
out
of
bondage
no
matter
what
the
bondage
no
matter
of
how
long
standing
the
president
elevation
to
this
unique
pinnacle
of
power
was
at
once
an
advantage
and
a
disadvantage
to
us
it
was
an
advantage
to
us
in
that
it
made
our
attack
more
dramatic
one
supposed
to
be
impeccable
was
more
vulnerable
it
was
a
disadvantage
to
have
to
overcome
this
universal
trust
and
popularity
but
this
conflict
of
wits
and
brains
against
power
only
enhanced
our
ingenuity
on
the
day
the
english
mission
headed
by
balfour
and
the
french
mission
headed
by
viviani
visited
the
white
house
we
took
these
inscriptions
to
the
picket
line
we
shall
fight
for
the
things
we
have
always
carried
nearest
our
hearts
democracy
should
begin
at
home
we
demand
justice
and
in
our
own
land
embarrassing
to
say
these
things
before
foreign
visitors
we
hoped
it
would
be
in
our
capacity
to
embarrass
wilson
in
his
administration
lay
our
only
hope
of
success
we
had
to
keep
before
the
country
the
flagrant
inconsistency
of
the
president
position
we
intended
to
know
why
if
democracy
were
so
precious
as
to
demand
the
nation
blood
and
treasure
for
its
achievement
abroad
its
execution
at
home
was
so
undesirable
meanwhile
i
tell
you
solemnly
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
can
not
any
longer
postpone
justice
in
these
united
states
wilson
i
do
wish
to
sit
down
and
let
any
man
take
care
of
me
without
my
at
least
having
a
voice
in
it
and
if
he
does
listen
to
my
advice
i
am
going
to
make
it
as
unpleasant
as
i
can
president
wilson
other
challenges
were
carried
on
banners
to
the
picket
line
some
rumblings
of
political
action
began
to
be
heard
the
democratic
majority
had
appointed
a
senate
committee
on
woman
suffrage
whose
members
were
overwhelmingly
for
federal
action
the
chairman
senator
andreas
jones
of
new
mexico
promised
an
early
report
to
the
senate
there
were
scores
of
gains
in
congress
representatives
and
senators
were
tumbling
over
each
other
to
introduce
similar
suffrage
resolutions
we
actually
had
difficulty
in
choosing
the
man
whose
name
should
stamp
our
measure
a
minority
party
also
was
moved
to
act
members
of
the
progressive
party
met
in
convention
in
louis
on
april
and
and
adopted
a
suffrage
plank
which
demanded
the
wide
enfranchisement
of
women
in
addition
to
this
plank
they
adopted
a
resolution
calling
for
the
establishment
of
democracy
at
home
at
a
time
when
the
united
states
is
entering
into
an
international
war
for
democracy
and
instructing
the
chairman
of
the
convention
to
request
a
committee
consisting
of
representatives
of
all
liberal
groups
to
go
to
washington
to
present
to
the
president
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
a
demand
for
immediate
mission
of
an
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
enfranchising
women
they
appointed
a
committee
from
the
convention
to
carry
these
resolutions
to
the
president
the
committee
included
j
hopkins
of
the
progressive
party
as
chairman
rumley
of
the
party
and
vice
president
of
the
new
york
evening
mail
john
spargo
of
the
socialist
party
virgil
hinshaw
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
prohibition
party
and
miss
mabel
vernon
secretary
of
the
national
woman
party
it
was
the
first
suffrage
conference
with
the
president
after
the
declaration
of
war
and
was
the
last
deputation
on
suffrage
by
minority
party
leaders
the
conference
was
one
of
the
utmost
informality
and
friendliness
the
president
was
deeply
moved
indeed
almost
to
the
point
of
tears
when
miss
mabel
vernon
said
president
the
feelings
of
many
women
in
this
country
are
best
expressed
by
your
own
words
in
your
war
message
to
congress
to
every
woman
who
reads
that
message
must
come
at
once
this
question
if
the
right
of
those
who
submit
to
authority
to
have
a
voice
in
their
own
government
is
so
sacred
a
cause
to
foreign
people
as
to
constitute
the
reason
for
our
entering
the
international
war
in
its
defense
will
you
not
president
give
immediate
aid
to
the
measure
before
congress
demanding
for
the
women
of
this
country
the
president
admitted
that
suffrage
was
constantly
pressing
upon
his
mind
for
reconsideration
he
added
however
that
the
program
for
the
session
was
practically
complete
and
intimated
that
it
did
not
include
the
enfranchisement
of
women
he
informed
the
committee
that
he
had
written
a
letter
to
pou
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
of
the
house
expressing
himself
as
favoring
the
creation
of
a
woman
suffrage
committee
in
that
body
while
we
had
no
objection
to
having
the
house
create
a
suffrage
committee
we
were
not
primarily
interested
in
the
amplification
of
congressional
machinery
unless
this
amplification
was
to
be
followed
by
the
passage
of
the
amendment
the
president
could
as
easily
have
written
the
senate
committee
on
suffrage
or
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
advising
an
immediate
report
on
the
suffrage
resolution
as
have
asked
for
the
creation
of
another
committee
to
report
on
the
subject
he
made
no
mention
of
his
conviction
however
as
he
had
in
previous
interviews
and
the
committee
of
progressives
understood
him
to
have
at
least
tacitly
accepted
federal
action
the
house
judiciary
committee
continued
to
refuse
to
act
and
the
house
rules
committee
steadily
refused
to
create
a
suffrage
committee
hoping
to
win
back
to
the
fold
the
wandering
progressives
who
had
thus
demonstrated
their
allegiance
to
suffrage
and
seeing
an
opportunity
to
embarrass
the
administration
the
republicans
began
to
interest
themselves
in
action
on
the
amendment
in
the
midst
of
democratic
delays
representative
james
mann
republican
leader
of
the
house
moved
to
discharge
the
judiciary
committee
from
further
consideration
of
the
suffrage
amendment
no
matter
if
the
discussion
which
followed
did
revolve
about
the
authorization
of
an
expenditure
of
for
the
erection
of
a
monument
to
a
dead
president
as
a
legitimate
war
measure
it
was
clear
from
the
partisan
attitude
of
those
who
took
part
in
the
debate
that
we
were
advancing
to
that
position
where
we
were
as
good
political
material
to
be
contested
over
by
opposing
political
groups
as
was
a
monument
to
a
dead
president
and
if
the
democrats
could
defend
such
an
issue
as
a
war
measure
the
republicans
wanted
to
know
why
they
should
ignore
suffrage
for
women
as
a
war
measure
and
it
was
encouraging
to
find
ourselves
thus
suddenly
and
spontaneously
sponsored
by
the
republican
leader
the
administration
was
aroused
it
did
not
know
how
far
the
republicans
were
prepared
to
go
in
their
drive
for
action
so
on
the
day
of
this
flurry
in
the
house
the
rules
committee
suddenly
met
in
answer
to
the
call
of
its
chairman
pou
and
by
a
vote
of
to
decided
to
report
favorably
on
the
resolution
providing
for
a
woman
suffrage
committee
in
the
house
after
all
pending
war
measures
have
been
disposed
of
before
the
meeting
pou
made
a
last
appeal
to
the
party
to
remove
the
pickets
we
ca
possibly
win
as
long
as
pickets
guard
the
white
house
and
capitol
pou
had
said
the
pickets
continued
their
vigil
and
the
motion
carried
still
uncertain
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
republicans
the
democrats
were
moved
to
further
action
the
executive
committee
of
the
democratic
national
committee
meeting
in
washington
a
few
days
later
voted
to
to
officially
urge
upon
the
president
that
he
call
the
two
houses
of
congress
together
and
recommend
the
immediate
submission
of
the
susan
anthony
amendment
this
action
which
in
effect
reversed
the
plank
in
the
democratic
platform
evidently
aroused
protests
from
powerful
quarters
also
the
republicans
quickly
subsided
when
they
saw
the
democrats
making
an
advance
and
so
the
democratic
executive
committee
began
to
spread
abroad
the
news
that
its
act
was
not
really
official
but
merely
reflected
the
personal
conviction
of
the
members
present
it
extracted
the
official
flavor
and
so
of
course
no
action
followed
in
congress
and
so
it
a
great
game
of
chess
doubtless
the
politicians
believed
they
were
moved
from
their
own
true
and
noble
motives
the
fact
was
that
the
pickets
had
moved
the
democrats
a
step
the
republicans
had
then
attempted
to
take
two
steps
whereupon
the
democrats
must
continue
to
move
more
rapidly
than
their
opponents
behind
this
matching
of
political
wits
by
the
two
parties
stood
the
faithful
pickets
compelling
them
both
to
act
simultaneously
with
these
moves
and
in
political
circles
the
people
in
all
sections
of
this
vast
country
began
to
speak
their
minds
meetings
were
springing
up
everywhere
at
which
resolutions
were
passed
backing
up
the
picket
line
and
urging
the
president
and
congress
to
act
even
the
south
the
administration
stronghold
sent
fiery
telegrams
demanding
action
alabama
south
carolina
texas
maryland
mississippi
as
well
as
the
west
middle
west
new
england
and
the
stream
was
endless
every
time
a
new
piece
of
legislation
was
passed
the
war
tax
bill
food
conservation
or
what
not
from
pected
quarters
sent
to
the
government
their
protest
against
the
passage
of
measures
so
vital
to
women
without
consent
coupled
with
an
appeal
for
the
liberation
of
women
club
women
college
women
federations
of
labor
various
kinds
of
organizations
sent
protests
to
the
administration
leaders
the
picket
line
approaching
its
sixth
month
of
duty
had
aroused
the
country
to
an
unprecedented
interest
in
frage
it
had
rallied
widespread
public
support
to
the
ment
as
a
war
measure
and
had
itself
become
almost
sally
accepted
if
not
universally
approved
and
in
the
midst
of
picketing
ands
in
spite
of
all
the
prophecies
and
fears
that
picketing
would
set
back
the
cause
within
one
month
michigan
nebraska
and
rhode
island
granted
presidential
suffrage
to
women
the
leaders
were
busy
marshaling
their
forces
behind
the
president
war
program
which
included
the
controversial
conscription
and
espionage
bills
then
pending
and
did
not
relish
having
our
question
so
vivid
in
the
public
mind
even
when
the
rank
and
file
of
congress
gave
consideration
to
questions
not
in
the
war
program
they
had
to
face
a
possible
charge
of
inconsistency
insincerity
or
bad
faith
the
freedom
of
ireland
for
example
was
not
in
the
program
and
when
members
of
the
house
cabled
lloyd
george
that
nothing
would
do
more
for
american
enthusiasm
in
the
war
than
a
settlement
of
the
irish
question
we
took
pains
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
belief
in
liberty
at
home
of
these
easy
champions
of
irish
liberty
when
we
found
that
of
the
men
only
believed
in
liberty
for
american
women
we
were
not
delicate
in
pointing
out
to
the
remaining
that
their
belief
in
liberty
for
ireland
would
appear
more
sincere
if
they
believed
in
a
democratic
reform
such
as
woman
suffrage
here
the
manifestations
of
popular
approval
of
suffrage
the
constant
stream
of
protests
to
the
administration
against
its
delay
nationally
and
the
shame
of
having
women
begging
at
its
gates
could
result
in
only
one
of
two
things
the
administration
had
little
choice
it
must
yield
to
this
pressure
from
the
people
or
it
must
suppress
the
agitation
which
was
causing
such
interest
it
must
pass
the
amendment
or
remove
the
troublesome
pickets
it
decided
to
remove
the
pickets
chapter
the
first
arrests
the
administration
chose
suppression
they
resorted
to
force
in
an
attempt
to
end
picketing
it
was
a
policy
doomed
to
failure
as
certainly
as
all
resorts
to
force
to
kill
agitation
have
failed
ultimately
this
marked
the
beginning
of
the
adoption
by
the
administration
of
tactics
from
which
they
could
never
extricate
themselves
with
honor
unfortunately
for
them
they
were
entering
upon
this
policy
toward
women
which
savored
of
czarist
practices
at
the
very
moment
they
were
congratulating
the
russians
upon
their
liberation
from
the
oppression
of
a
czar
this
fact
supplied
us
with
a
fresh
angle
of
attack
president
wilson
sent
a
mission
to
russia
to
add
america
appeal
to
that
of
the
other
allies
to
keep
that
impoverished
country
in
the
war
such
was
zeal
to
persuade
russia
to
continue
the
war
and
to
convince
her
people
of
its
democratic
purposes
and
of
the
democratic
quality
of
america
that
elihu
root
one
of
the
president
envoys
stated
in
petrograd
that
he
represented
a
republic
where
universal
direct
equal
and
secret
suffrage
obtained
we
subjected
the
president
to
attack
through
this
statement
russia
also
sent
a
war
mission
to
our
country
for
purposes
of
cooperation
this
occasion
offered
us
the
opportunity
again
to
expose
the
administration
weakness
in
claiming
complete
political
democracy
while
women
were
still
denied
their
political
freedom
it
was
a
beautiful
june
day
when
all
washington
was
agog
with
the
visit
of
the
russian
diplomats
to
the
president
as
the
car
carrying
the
envoys
passed
swiftly
through
the
gates
of
the
white
house
there
stood
on
the
picket
line
two
silent
sentinels
miss
lucy
burns
of
new
york
and
lawrence
lewis
of
philadelphia
both
members
of
the
national
executive
committee
with
a
great
lettered
banner
which
read
to
the
russian
envoys
president
wilson
and
envoy
root
are
deceiving
russia
when
they
say
we
are
a
democracy
help
us
win
the
world
war
so
that
democracy
may
survive
we
the
women
of
america
tell
you
that
amer
ica
is
not
a
democracy
can
women
are
denied
the
right
to
vote
presi
dent
wilson
is
the
chief
opponent
of
their
na
tional

help
us
make
this
nation
really
free
tell
our
government
it
must
liberate
its
people
before
it
can
claim
free
russia
as
an
ally
rumors
that
the
suffragists
would
make
a
special
demonstration
before
the
russian
mission
had
brought
a
great
crowd
to
the
far
gate
of
the
white
house
a
crowd
composed
almost
entirely
of
men
like
all
crowds
this
crowd
had
its
share
of
hoodlums
and
roughs
who
tried
to
interfere
with
the
women
order
of
the
day
there
was
a
flurry
of
excitement
over
this
defiant
message
of
truth
but
nothing
that
could
not
with
the
utmost
ease
have
been
settled
by
one
policeman
there
was
the
criticism
in
the
press
and
on
the
lips
of
men
that
we
were
embarrassing
our
government
before
the
eyes
of
foreign
visitors
in
answering
the
criticism
miss
paul
publicly
stated
our
position
thus
the
intolerable
conditions
against
which
we
protest
can
be
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
responsibility
for
our
protest
is
therefore
with
the
administration
and
not
with
the
women
of
america
if
the
lack
of
democracy
at
home
weakens
the
administration
in
its
fight
for
democracy
three
thousand
miles
away
this
was
too
dreadful
a
flurry
at
the
gates
of
the
chief
of
the
nation
at
such
a
time
would
never
do
our
allies
in
the
crusade
for
democracy
must
not
know
that
we
had
a
unrest
at
home
something
must
be
done
to
stop
this
expose
at
once
had
these
women
no
manners
had
they
no
shame
was
the
fundamental
weakness
in
our
boast
of
pure
and
perfect
democracy
to
be
so
wantonly
displayed
with
impunity
of
course
it
was
embarrassing
we
meant
it
to
be
the
truth
must
be
told
at
all
costs
this
was
no
time
for
manners
hurried
conferences
behind
closed
doors
summoning
of
the
military
to
discuss
declaring
a
military
zone
around
the
white
house
women
could
not
advance
on
drawn
bayonets
and
if
they
did
what
a
picture
common
decency
told
the
more
humane
leaders
that
this
would
never
do
i
daresay
political
wisdom
crept
into
the
reasoning
of
others
closing
the
woman
party
headquarters
was
discussed
perhaps
a
raid
and
all
for
what
because
women
were
holding
banners
asking
for
the
precious
principle
at
home
that
men
were
supposed
to
be
dying
for
abroad
finally
a
decision
was
reached
embodying
the
combined
wisdom
of
all
the
various
conferees
the
chief
of
police
major
pullman
was
detailed
to
request
us
to
stop
picketing
and
to
tell
us
that
if
we
continued
to
picket
we
would
be
we
have
picketed
for
six
months
without
interference
said
miss
paul
has
the
law
been
changed
no
was
the
reply
but
you
must
stop
it
but
major
pullman
we
have
consulted
our
lawyers
and
know
we
have
a
legal
right
to
picket
i
warn
you
you
will
be
arrested
if
you
attempt
to
picket
again
the
following
day
miss
lucy
burns
and
miss
katherine
morey
of
boston
carried
to
the
white
house
gates
we
shall
fight
for
the
things
we
have
always
held
nearest
our
hearts
for
democracy
for
the
right
of
those
who
submit
to
authority
to
have
a
voice
in
their
own
government
and
were
arrested
news
had
spread
through
the
city
that
the
pickets
were
to
be
arrested
a
moderately
large
crowd
had
gathered
to
see
the
fun
one
has
only
to
come
into
conflict
with
prevailing
authority
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
to
find
friendly
hosts
vanishing
with
lightning
speed
to
know
that
we
were
no
longer
wanted
at
the
gates
of
the
white
house
and
that
the
police
were
no
longer
our
friends
was
enough
for
the
mob
mind
some
members
of
the
crowd
made
sport
of
the
women
others
hurled
cheap
and
childish
epithets
at
them
small
boys
were
allowed
to
capture
souvenirs
shreds
of
the
banners
torn
from
women
as
trophies
of
the
sport
thinking
they
had
been
mistaken
in
believing
the
pickets
were
to
be
arrested
and
having
grown
weary
of
their
strenuous
sport
the
crowd
moved
on
its
way
two
solitary
figures
remained
standing
on
the
sidewalk
flanked
by
the
vast
pennsylvania
avenue
looking
quite
abandoned
and
alone
when
suddenly
without
any
warrant
in
law
they
were
arrested
on
a
completely
deserted
avenue
miss
burns
and
miss
morey
upon
arriving
at
the
police
station
insisted
to
the
great
surprise
of
all
the
officials
upon
knowing
the
charge
against
them
major
pullman
and
his
entire
staff
were
utterly
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
answer
the
administration
had
looked
ahead
only
as
far
as
threatening
arrest
they
doubtless
thought
this
was
all
they
would
have
to
do
people
could
not
be
arrested
for
picketing
picketing
is
a
guaranteed
right

the

had
stood
as
silent
sentinels
holding
the
president
own
eloquent
words
doors
opened
and
closed
mysteriously
officials
and
subofficials
passed
hurriedly
to
and
fro
whispered
conversations
were
heard
the
book
on
rules
and
regulations
was
hopefully
thumbed
hours
passed
finally
the
two
prisoners
were
pompously
told
that
they
had
obstructed
the
traffic
on
pennsylvania
avenue
were
dismissed
on
their
own
recognizance
and
never
brought
to
trial
the
following
day
june
more
arrests
were
made
two
women
at
the
white
house
two
at
the
capitol
all
carried
banners
with
the
same
words
of
the
president
there
was
no
hesitation
this
time
they
were
promptly
arrested
for
obstructing
the
traffic
they
too
were
dismissed
and
their
cases
never
tried
it
seemed
clear
that
the
administration
hoped
to
suppress
picketing
merely
by
arrests
when
however
women
continued
to
picket
in
the
face
of
arrest
the
administration
quickened
its
advance
into
the
venture
of
suppression
it
decided
to
bring
the
offenders
to
trial
on
june
six
american
women
were
tried
judged
guilty
on
the
technical
charge
of
obstructing
the
traffic
warned
by
the
court
of
their
unpatriotic
almost
treasonable
behavior
and
sentenced
to
pay
a
fine
of
dollars
or
serve
three
days
in
jail
not
a
dollar
of
your
fine
will
we
pay
was
the
answer
of
the
women
to
pay
a
fine
would
be
an
admission
of
guilt
we
are
innocent
the
six
women
who
were
privileged
to
serve
the
first
terms
of
imprisonment
for

cheering
crowd

from
the
consent
of
the
governed
in

of
the

thirteen
silent
sentinels
with
banners
bearing
the

words
are
arrested
it
would
have
been
exceedingly
droll
if
it
had
not
been
so
tragic
champ
clark
and
his
throng
were
not
molested
the
women
with
practically
a
deserted
street
were
arrested
and
served
jail
terms
for
obstructing
traffic
the
trial
of
this
group
was
delayed
to
give
the
jail
authorities
time
to
vacate
and
tidy
up
as
one
prisoner
confided
to
miss
joy
young
it
developed
that
orders
had
been
received
at
the
jail
immediately
after
the
arrests
and
before
the
trial
to
make
ready
for
the
suffragettes
what
did
it
matter
that
their
case
had
not
yet
been
heard
to
jail
they
must
go
was
not
the
judge
who
tried
and
sentenced
them
a
direct
appointee
of
president
wilson
were
not
the
district
commissioners
who
gave
orders
to
prepare
the
cells
the
direct
appointees
of
president
wilson
and
was
not
the
chief
of
police
of
the
district
of
columbia
a
direct
appointee
of
these
same
commissioners
and
was
not
the
jail
warden
who
made
life
for
the
women
so
unbearable
in
prison
also
a
direct
appointee
of
the
commissioners
it
was
all
a
merry
little
ring
and
its
cavalier
attitude
toward
the
law
toward
justice
and
above
all
toward
women
was
of
no
importance
the
world
was
on
fire
with
a
grand
blaze
this
tiny
flame
would
scarcely
be
visible
no
one
would
notice
a
few
mad
women
thrown
into
jail
and
if
the
world
should
find
it
out
doubtless
public
opinion
would
agree
that
the
women
ought
to
stay
there
and
even
if
it
should
not
agree
this
little
matter
could
all
be
explained
away
before
another
election

inspiring
scenes

tragic
sacrifices
for

come
to
our
minds
sixteen
women
march
in
single
file
to
take
their
own
liberty
equality
fraternity
to
the
white
house
gates
it
is
the
middle
of
a
hot
afternoon
a
thin
line
of
curious
spectators
is
seen
in
the
park
opposite
the
suffrage
headquarters
the
police
assemble
from
obscure
spots
some
afoot
others
on
bicycles
they
close
in
on
the
women
and
follow
them
to
the
gates
the
proud
banner
is
scarcely
at
the
gates
when
the
leader
is
placed
under
arrest
her
place
is
taken
by
another
she
is
taken
another
and
still
another
steps
into
the
breach
and
is
arrested
meanwhile
the
crowd
grows
attracted
to
the
spot
by
the
presence
of
the
police
and
the
patrol
wagon
applause
is
heard
there
are
cries
of
shame
for
the
police
who
i
must
say
did
not
always
act
as
if
they
relished
carrying
out
what
they
termed
orders
from
higher
up
an
occasional
hoot
from
a
small
boy
served
to
make
the
mood
of
the
hostile
ones
a
bit
gayer
but
for
the
most
part
an
intense
silence
fell
upon
the
watchers
as
they
saw
not
only
younger
women
but
whitehaired
grandmothers
hoisted
before
the
public
gaze
into
the
crowded
patrol
their
heads
erect
their
eyes
a
little
moist
and
their
frail
hands
holding
tightly
to
the
banner
until
wrested
from
them
by
superior
brute
force
this
is
the
first
time
most
of
the
women
have
ever
seen
a
police
station
and
they
are
interested
in
their
surroundings
they
are
not
interested
in
helping
the
panting
policeman
count
them
over
and
identify
them
who
arrested
whom
that
becomes
the
gigantic
question
will
the
ladies
please
tell
which
officer
arrested
them
they
will
not
they
do
not
intend
to
be
a
party
to
this
outrage
finally
the
officers
abandon
their
attempt
at
identification
they
have
the
names
of
the
arrestees
and
will
accept
bail
for
their
appearance

i
act
as
attorneys
for
the
group
the
same
panting
policemen
who
could
not
identify
the
people
they
had
arrested
give
their
stereotyped
false
and
illiterate
testimony
the
judge
helps
them
over
the
hard
places
and
so
does
the
government
attorney
they
stumble
to
an
embarrassed
finish
and
retire
an
aged
government
clerk
grown
infirm
in
the
service
takes
the
stand
and
the
government
attorney
proves
through
him
that
there
is
a
white
house
that
it
has
a
in
front
of
it
and
a
pavement
and
a
hundred
other
overwhelming
facts
the
pathetic
clerk
shakes
his
dusty
frame
and
slinks
off
the
stand
the
prosecuting
attorney
now
elaborately
proves
that
we
walked
that
we
carried
banners
that
we
were
arrested
by
the
aforesaid
officers
while
attempting
to
hold
our
banners
at

speaks
briefly

she
nounces

squarely
at
the
door

in
unmistakable
terms

opens
for
the
defense
this
is
what
we
are
doing
with
our
banners
before
the
white
house
petitioning
the
most
powerful
representative
of
the
government
the
president
of
the
united

for
a
redress
of
grievances
we
are
asking
him
to
use
his
great
power
to
secure
the
passage
of
the
national
suffrage
amendment
as
long
as
the
government
and
the
representatives
of
the
government
prefer
to
send
women
to
jail
on
petty
and
technical
charges
we
will
go

jail
persecution
has
always
advanced
the
cause

the

would
hinder
not
help
the
whole
cause
of

if
we
weakly
submitted
to
persecution

our
work
for

full
well
that
we
stand
here
because
the

refuses
to
give
liberty
to
american
women
we
believe
your
honor
that
the
wrong
persons
are
before

in
this
court
i
object
your
honor

making

a
statement
here
in

says
the

we
believe
the

is
the
guilty
one
and
that
we
are
innocent

i
object
shouts
the

attorney
the
prisoner
continues
calmly
there
are
votes
enough
and
there
is
time
enough
to
pass
the
national

amendment
through
congress
at
this
session
more
than
votes
in
the
house
and
more
than
in
the
senate
are
pledged
to
this
amendment
the
president
puts
his
power
behind
all
measures
in
which
he
takes
a
genuine
interest
if
he
will
say
one
frank
word
advocating
this
measure
it
will
pass
as
a
piece
of
war

has
been
with
a
father
who
believed
in
democracy
and
who
belonged
to
the
democratic
party
by
inheritance
and
connection
i
am
a
democrat
and
to
a
democratic
president
i
went
with
my
appeal
what
a
spectacle
it
must
be
to
the
thinking
people
of
this
country
to
see
us
urged
to
go
to
war
for
democracy
in
a
foreign
land
and
to
see
women
thrown
into
prison
who
plead
for
that
same
cause
at
home
i
stand
here
to
affirm
my
innocence
of
the
charge
against
me
this
court
has
not
proven
that
i
obstructed
traffic
my
presence
at
the
white
house
gate
was
under
the
constitutional
right
of
petitioning
the
government
for
freedom
or
for
any
other
cause
during
the
months
of
january
february
march
april
and
may
picketing
was
legal
in
june
it
suddenly
becomes
illegal
my
services
as
an
american
woman
are
being
conscripted
by
order
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
help
win
the
world
war
for
democracy
the
right
of
those
who
submit
to
authority
to
have
a
voice
in
their
own
government
i
shall
continue
to
plead
for
the
political
liberty
of
american
especially
do
i
plead
to
the
president
since
he
is
the
one
person
who
can
end
the
struggles
of
american
women
to
take
their
proper
places
in
a
true
democracy
there
is
continuous
objection
from
the
prosecutor
eager
advice
from
the
judge
you
had
better
keep
to
the
charge
of
obstructing
traffic
but
round
on
round
of
applause
comes
from
the
intent
audience
whenever
a
defiant
note
is
struck
by
the
prisoners
and
in
spite
of
the
sharp
rapping
of
the
gavel
confusion
reigns
and
how
utterly
puny
the
charge
is
if
it
were
true
that
the
prisoners
actually
obstructed
the
traffic
how
grotesque
that
would
be
the
importance
of
their
demand
the
purity
of
their
reasoning
the
nobility
and
gentle
quality
of
the
prisoners
at
the
bar
all
conspire
to
make
the
charge
against
them
and
the
attorney
who
makes
it
and
the
judge
who
hears
it
petty
and
ridiculous
but
justice
must
proceed
gilson
gardner
of
washington
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
national
woman
party
and
the
wife
of
gilson
gardner
a
liberal
and
journalist
speaks
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
believe
that
we
were
arrested
because
we
were
obstructing
traffic
or
blocking
the
public
way
we
have
been
carrying
on
activities
of
a
distinctly
political
nature
and
these
political
activities
have
seemingly
disturbed
certain
powerful
influences
arrests
followed
i
submit
that
these
arrests
are
purely
political
and
that
the
charge
of
an
unlawful
assemblage
and
of
obstructing
traffic
is
a
political
subterfuge
even
should
i
be
sent
to
jail
which
i
could
not
your
honor
anticipate
i
would
be
in
jail
not
because
i
obstructed
traffic
but
because
i
have
offended
politically
because
i
have
demanded
of
this
government
freedom
for
women
it
was
my
task
to
sum
up
for
the
defense
the
judge
sat
bored
through
my
statement
we
know
and
i
believe
the
court
knows
also
i
said
that
president
wilson
and
his
administration
are
responsible
for
our
being
here
it
is
a
fact
that
they
gave
the
orders
which
caused
our
arrest
and
appearance
before
this
bar
we
know
and
you
know
that
the
district
commissioners
are
appointed
by
the
president
that
the
present
commissioners
were
appointed
by
president
wilson
we
know
that
you
your
honor
were
appointed
to
the
bench
by
president
wilson
and
that
the
district
attorney
who
prosecutes
us
was
appointed
by
the
president
these
various
officers
would
not
dare
bring
us
here
under
these
false
charges
without
the
policy
having
been
decided
upon
by
the
responsible
leaders
what
is
our
real
crime
what
have
these
distinguished
and
women
done
to
bring
them
before
this
court
of
justice
why
your
honor
their
crime
is
that
they
peacefully
petitioned
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
liberty
what
must
be
the
shame
of
our
nation
before
the
world
when
it
becomes
known
that
here
we
throw
women
into
jail
who
love
liberty
and
attempt
to
peacefully
petition
the
president
for
it
these
women
are
nearly
all
descended
from
revolutionary
ancestors
or
from
some
of
the
greatest
libertarian
statesmen
this
country
has
produced
what
would
these
men
say
now
if
they
could
see
that
passion
for
liberty
which
was
in
their
own
hearts
rewarded
in
the
twentieth
century
with
foul
and
filthy
imprisonment
we
say
to
you
this
outrageous
policy
of
stupid
and
brutal
punishment
will
not
dampen
the
ardor
of
the
women
where
sixteen
of
us
face
your
judgment
there
will
be
sixty
tomorrow
so
great
will
be
the
indignation
of
our
colleagues
in
this
fight
the
trial
came
to
an
end
after
a
tense
two
days
the
packed
fat
in
a
terrible
silence
awaiting
the
judge
answer
there
were
distinguished
men
present
at
the
who
also
fight
for
their
ideals
there
was
frederic
howe
then
commissioner
of
immigration
of
the
port
of
new
york
frank
walsh
international
labor
leader
dudley
field
malone
then
collector
of
the
port
of
new
york
amos
pinchot
liberal
leader
john
hopkins
then
leader
in
new
jersey
who
had
turned
his
organization
to
the
support
of
the
president
and
become
a
member
of
the
president
campaign
committee
now
chairman
of
the
committee
of
fortyeight
and
whose
beautiful
wife
was
among
the
prisoners
allen
mccurdy
secretary
of
the
committee
of
and
many
others
one
and
all
came
forward
to
protest
to
us
during
the
adjournment
this
is
monstrous
never
have
i
seen
evidence
so
disregarded
this
is
a
tragic
farce
he
will
never
dare
sentence
you
it
was
reported
to
us
that
the
judge
used
the
interim
to
telephone
to
the
district
building
where
the
district
commissioners
sit
he
returned
to
pronounce
sixty
days
in
the
workhouse
in
default
of
a
dollar
fine
the
shock
was
swift
and
certain
to
all
the
spectators
we
would
not
of
course
pay
the
unjust
fine
imposed
for
we
were
not
guilty
of
any
offense
the
judge
attempted
persuasion
you
had
better
decide
to
pay
your
fines
he
ventured
and
you
will
not
find
jail
a
pleasant
place
to
be
it
was
clear
that
neither
he
nor
his
confreres
had
imagined
women
would
accept
with
equanimity
so
drastic
a
sentence
it
was
now
their
time
to
be
shocked
here
were
ladies
was
perfectly
ladies
of
unusual
distinction
surely
they
would
not
face
the
humiliation
of
a
workhouse
sentence
which
involved
not
only
imprisonment
but
penal
servitude
the
administration
was
wrong
again
we
protest
against
this
unjust
sentence
and
conviction
we
said
but
we
prefer
the
workhouse
to
the
payment
of
a
fine
imposed
for
an
offense
of
which
we
are
not
guilty
we
filed
into
the
pen
to
join
the
other
prisoners
and
wait
for
the
black
maria
to
carry
us
to
prison
we
are
all
taken
to
the
district
jail
where
we
are
put
through
the
regular
catechism
were
you
ever
in
prison
before
and
what
not
we
are
then
locked
up
to
a
cell
what
will
happen
next
the
sleek
jailer
whose
attempt
to
be
cordial
provokes
a
certain
distrust
comes
to
our
corridor
to
turn
us
over
to
our
next
warden
of
occoquan
we
learn
that
the
workhouse
is
not
situated
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
in
virginia
other
locked
wagons
with
tiny
windows
up
near
the
driver
now
take
us
side
by
side
with
drunks
and
disorderlies
prostitutes
and
thieves
to
the
pennsylvania
station
here
we
embark
for
the
unknown
terrors
of
the
workhouse
filing
through
crowds
at
the
station
driven
on
by
our
keeper
who
resembles
simon
legree
with
his
long
stick
and
his
pushing
and
shoving
to
hurry
us
along
the
crowd
is
quick
to
realize
that
we
are
prisoners
because
of
our
associates
friends
try
to
bid
us
a
last
farewell
and
slip
us
a
sweet
or
fruit
as
we
are
rushed
through
the
iron
station
gates
to
the
train
warden
whittaker
is
our
keeper
thin
and
old
with
a
cruel
mouth
brutal
eyes
and
a
sinister
birthmark
on
his
temple
he
guards
very
anxiously
his
dangerous
criminals
lest
they
try
to
leap
out
of
the
train
to
freedom
we
chat
a
little
and
attempt
to
relax
from
the
strain
that
we
have
endured
since
saturday
it
is
now
late
in
the
afternoon
of
tuesday
the
dusk
is
gathering
it
is
almost
totally
dark
when
we
alight
at
a
tiny
station
in
what
seems
to
us
a
wilderness
it
is
a
deserted
country
even
the
gayest
member
of
the
party
i
am
sure
was
struck
with
a
little
terror
here
more
locked
wagons
blacker
than
the
dusk
awaited
us
the
prison
van
jolted
and
bumped
along
the
rocky
and
hilly
road
a
cluster
of
lights
twinkled
beyond
the
last
hill
and
we
knew
that
we
were
coming
to
our
temporary
summer
residence
i
can
still
see
the
long
thin
line
of
black
poplars
against
the
smoldering
afterglow
i
did
not
know
then
what
tragic
things
they
concealed
we
entered
a
office
a
few
guards
of
ugly
demeanor
stood
about
warden
whittaker
consulted
with
the
matron
herndon
who
began
the
prison
routine
names
were
called
and
each
prisoner
stepped
to
the
desk
to
get
her
number
to
give
up
all
jewelry
money
handbags
letters
traveling
bags
containing
toilet
necessities
in
fact
everything
except
the
clothes
on
her
body
from
there
we
were
herded
into
the
long
bare
dining
room
where
we
sat
dumbly
down
to
a
bowl
of
dirty
sour
soup
i
say
now
began
the
rule
of
silence
prisoners
are
punished
for
speaking
to
one
another
at
table
they
can
not
even
whisper
much
less
smile
or
laugh
they
must
be
conscious
always
of
their
guilt
every
possible
thing
is
done
to
make
the
inmates
feel
that
they
are
and
must
continue
to
be
antisocial
creatures
we
taste
our
soup
and
crust
of
bread
we
try
so
hard
to
eat
it
for
we
are
tired
and
hungry
but
no
one
of
us
is
able
to
get
it
down
we
leave
the
table
hungry
and
slightly
nauseated
another
long
march
in
silence
through
various
channels
into
a
large
dormitory
and
through
a
double
line
of
cots
then
we
stand
weary
to
the
point
of
fainting
waiting
the
next
ordeal
this
seemed
to
be
the
juncture
at
which
we
lost
all
that
is
left
us
of
contact
with
the
outside
world
clothes
an
assistant
matron
attended
by
negress
prisoners
relieves
us
of
our
clothes
each
prisoner
is
obliged
to
strip
naked
without
even
the
protection
of
a
sheet
and
proceed
across
what
seems
endless
space
to
a
shower
bath
a
large
tin
bucket
stands
on
the
floor
and
in
this
is
a
minute
piece
of
dirty
soap
which
is
offered
to
us
and
rejected
we
dare
not
risk
the
soap
used
by
so
many
prisoners
naked
we
return
from
the
bath
to
receive
our
allotment
of
coarse
hideous
prison
clothes
the
outer
garments
of
which
consist
of
a
bulky
wrapper
of
bluish
gray
ticking
and
a
heavy
apron
of
the
same
dismal
stuff
it
takes
a
dominant
personality
indeed
to
survive
these
clothes
the
thick
unbleached
muslin
undergarments
are
of
designs
never
to
be
forgotten
and
the
thick
stockings
and
forlorn
shoes
what
torture
to
put
on
shoes
that
are
alike
for
each
foot
and
made
to
fit
just
anybody
who
may
happen
along
why
are
we
being
ordered
to
dress
it
is
long
past
the
hour
our
suspense
is
brief
all
dressed
in
cloth
of
guilt
we
are
led
into
what
we
later
learn
is
the
recreation
room
lined
up
against
its
wall
we
might
any
other
time
have
bantered
about
the
possibility
of
being
shot
but
we
are
in
no
mood
to
jest
the
door
finally
opens
and
in
strides
warden
whittaker
with
a
stranger
beside
him
he
reviews
his
latest
criminal
recruits
engaging
the
stranger
meanwhile
in
whispered
conversation
there
are
short
uncertain
laughs
there
are
nods
of
the
head
and
more
whispers
well
ladies
i
hope
you
are
all
comfortable
now
make
yourselves
at
home
here
i
think
you
will
find
it
healthy
here
you
weigh
more
when
you
go
out
than
when
you
came
in
you
will
be
allowed
to
write
one
letter
a
your
family
of
course
we
open
and
read
all
letters
coming
in
and
going
out
you
will
be
assigned
your
work
i
hope
you
will
sleep
well
good
night
we
did
not
answer
we
looked
at
each
other
news
leaked
through
in
the
morning
that
the
stranger
had
been
a
newspaper
reporter
the
papers
next
morning
were
full
of
the
comfort
and
luxury
of
our
surroundings
the
delicious
food
sounded
most
reassuring
to
the
nation
in
fact
no
word
of
the
truth
was
allowed
to
appear
the
correspondent
could
not
know
that
we
went
back
to
our
cots
to
try
to
sleep
side
by
side
with
negro
prostitutes
not
that
we
shrank
from
these
women
on
account
of
their
color
but
how
terrible
to
know
that
the
institution
had
gone
out
of
its
way
to
bring
these
prisoners
from
their
own
wing
to
the
white
wing
in
an
attempt
to
humiliate
us
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
the
negro
wing
but
prison
must
be
made
so
unbearable
that
no
more
women
would
face
it
that
was
the
policy
attempted
here
we
tried
very
hard
to
sleep
and
forget
our
hunger
and
weariness
but
all
the
night
through
our
dusky
comrades
padded
by
to
the
lavatory
and
in
the
streak
of
bright
light
which
shot
across
the
center
of
the
room
startled
heads
could
be
seen
bobbing
up
in
the
direction
of
a
demented
woman
in
the
end
cot
her
weird
mutterings
made
us
fearful
there
was
no
sleep
in
this
strange
place
our
thoughts
turn
to
the
outside
world
will
the
women
care
will
enough
women
believe
that
through
such
humiliation
all
may
win
freedom
will
they
believe
that
through
our
imprisonment
their
slavery
will
be
lifted
the
sooner
less
philosophically
will
the
government
be
moved
by
public
protest
will
such
protest
come
the
next
morning
brought
us
a
visitor
from
suffrage
headquarters
the
institution
hoped
that
the
visitor
would
use
her
persuasion
to
make
us
pay
our
fines
and
leave
and
so
she
was
admitted
we
learned
the
cheering
news
that
immediately
after
sentence
had
been
pronounced
by
the
court
dudley
field
malone
had
gone
direct
to
the
white
house
to
protest
to
the
president
his
protest
was
delivered
with
heat
the
president
said
that
he
was
shocked
at
the
sixty
day
sentence
that
he
did
not
know
it
had
been
done
and
made
other
evasions
malone
report
of
his
interview
with
the
president
is
given
in
full
in
a
subsequent
chapter
following
malone
j
hopkins
went
to
the
white
house
how
would
you
like
to
have
your
wife
sleep
in
a
dirty
workhouse
next
to
prostitutes
was
his
direct
talk
to
the
president
again
the
president
was
shocked
no
wonder
and
hopkins
had
been
the
president
dinner
guests
not
very
long
before
celebrating
his
return
to
power
they
had
supported
him
politically
and
financially
in
new
jersey
now
hopkins
had
been
arrested
at
his
gate
and
thrown
into
prison
in
reporting
the
interview
hopkins
said
the
president
asked
me
for
suggestions
as
to
what
might
be
done
and
i
replied
that
in
view
of
the
seriousness
of
the
present
situation
the
only
solution
lay
in
immediate
passage
of
the
susan
anthony
amendment
gilson
gardner
also
went
to
the
white
house
to
leave
his
hot
protest
and
there
were
others
telegrams
poured
in
from
all
over
the
country
the
press
printed
headlines
which
could
not
but
arouse
the
sympathy
of
thousands
even
people
who
did
not
approve
of
picketing
the
white
house
said
after
all
what
these
women
have
done
is
certainly
not
enough
to
merit
such
drastic
punishment
and
women
protested
from
coast
to
coast
there
poured
in
at
our
headquarters
copies
of
telegrams
sent
to
administration
leaders
of
course
not
all
women
by
any
means
had
approved
this
method
of
agitation
but
the
government
action
had
done
more
than
we
had
been
able
to
do
for
them
it
had
made
them
feel
women
were
being
unjustly
treated
regardless
of
their
feelings
about
this
particular
procedure
they
stood
up
and
objected
for
the
first
time
i
believe
our
form
of
agitation
began
to
seem
a
little
more
respectable
than
the
administration
handling
of
it
but
the
administration
did
not
know
this
fact
yet
everybody
in
line
for
the
we
were
thankful
to
leave
our
inedible
breakfast
we
were
unable
to
drink
the
greasy
black
coffee
the
pain
in
the
tops
of
our
heads
was
acute
what
you
all
down
here
for
asked
a
young
negress
barely
out
of
her
teens
as
she
casually
fingered
her
sewing
material
why
i
held
a
purple
white
and
gold
banner
at
the
gates
of
the
white
house
you
don
say
so
what
de
odders

same
thing

all
held
banners
at
the
white
house
gates
asking
president
wilson
to
give
us
the
vote
an
yo
all
got
sixty
days

dat

you
see
the
president
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea

the
workhouse
for
asking
for
the
vote
you
know
women
want

i

i
hopes

gits

vote

fixes
up
somethings
for
women
you
see
that
young
girl
over
there
said
another
prisoner
who
in
spite
of
an
unfortunate
life
had
kept
a
remnant
of
her
early
beauty
i
nodded
well
judge
mullowny
gave
her
thirty
days
for
her
first
offense
and
when
he
sentenced
her
she
cried
out
desperately
send
me
down
there
judge
if
you
do
i
kill
myself
what
do
you
think
he
said
to
that
give
you
six
months
in
which
to
change
your
mind
i
reflected
the
judge
that
broke
this
silent
girl
was
the
appointee
of
the
president
it
was
the
task
of
such
a
man
to
sentence
american
women
to
the
workhouse
for
demanding
liberty
conversing
with
the
regulars
was
forbidden
by
the
wardress
but
we
managed
from
time
to
time
to
talk
to
our
fellow
prisoners
with
stealthiness
we
knew
somethin
was
goin
to
happen
said
one
negro
girl
because
monday
the
close
we
had
on
wer
took
off
us
an
we
were
giv
these
old
patched
ones
we
wuz
told
they
wanted
to
take
but
we
heard
they
wuz
bein
washed
fo
the
unpleasantness
at
wearing
the
formless
garments
of
these
unfortunates
made
us
all
wince
but
the
government
calculation
aroused
our
hot
indignation
we
were
not
convicted
until
tuesday
and
our
prison
garments
were
ready
monday
you
must
not
speak
against
the
president
said
the
servile
wardress
when
she
discovered
we
were
telling
our
story
to
the
inmates
you
know
you
will
be
thrashed
if
you
say
anything
more
about
the
president
and
do
forget
you
on
government
property
and
may
be
arrested
for
treason
if
it
happens
again
we
doubted
the
seriousness
of
this
threat
of
thrashing
until
one
of
the
girls
confided
to
us
that
such
outrages
happened
often
we
afterward
obtained
proof
of
these
brutalities
old
whittaker
beat
up
that
girl
over
there
just
last
week
and
put
her
in
the
house
on
bread
and
water
for
five
days
what
did
she
do
i
asked
oh
she
an
another
girl
got
to
scrapping
in
the
blackberry
patch
and
she
did
pick
enough
berries
all
put
up
your
work
girls
and
get
in
line
this
from
the
wardress
who
sped
up
the
work
in
the
sewing
room
it
was
lunch
time
and
though
we
were
all
hungry
we
dreaded
going
to
the
silence
and
the
food
in
that
gray
dining
room
with
the
vile
odors
we
were
counted
again
as
we
filed
out
carrying
our
heavy
chairs
with
us
as
is
the
workhouse
custom
see
affidavit
of
bovee
page
do
they
do
this
all
the
time
i
asked
it
seemed
as
though
needless
energy
was
being
spent
counting
and
recounting
our
little
group
would
do
anybody
any
good
to
try
to
get
away
from
here
said
one
of
the
white
girls
too
many
bloodhounds
bloodhounds
i
asked
in
amazement
for
after
all
these
women
were
not
criminals
but
merely
misdemeanants
oh
yes
just
a
little
while
ago
three
men
tried
to
get
away
and
they
turned
bloodhounds
after
them
and
shot
them
they
were
bad
men
either
when
our
untasted
supper
was
over
that
night
we
were
ordered
into
the
square
recreation
room
where
we
and
the
other
prisoners
sat
and
sat
and
sat
our
chairs
against
the
walls
a
dreary
sight
indeed
waiting
for
the
fortyfive
minutes
before
bedtime
to
pass
the
sight
of
two
negro
girl
prisoners
combing
out
each
other
lice
and
dressing
their
kinky
hair
in
such
a
way
as
to
discourage
permanently
a
return
of
the
vermin
did
not
produce
in
us
exactly
a
feeling
of
recreation
but
we
tried
to
sing
the
negroes
joined
in
too
and
soon
outsang
us
with
their
plaintive
melodies
and
hymns
then
back
to
our
cells
and
another
attempt
to
sleep
a
new
ordeal
the
next
morning
another
of
the
numberless
pedigrees
is
to
be
taken
one
by
one
we
were
called
to
the
warden
office
were
your
father
or
mother
ever
insane
are
you
a
confirmed
drunkard
chronic
or
moderate
drinker
do
you
smoke
or
chew
or
use
tobacco
in
any
form
married
or
single
single
how
many
children
none
what
religion
do
you
profess
christian
what
religion
do
you
profess
in
a
higher
pitched
voice
i
did
not
clearly
comprehend
do
you
mean
i
a
catholic
or
a
protestant
i
am
a
christian
but
it
was
of
no
avail
she
wrote
down
none
i
protested
that
is
not
accurate
i
insist
that
i
am
a
christian
or
at
least
i
try
to
be
one
you
must
learn
to
be
polite
she
retorted
almost
fiercely
and
i
returned
to
the
sewing
room
for
the
hundredth
time
we
asked
to
be
given
our
toothbrushes
combs
handkerchiefs
and
our
own
soap
the
third
day
of
imprisonment
without
any
of
these
essentials
found
us
depressed
and
worried
over
our
unsanitary
condition
we
plead
also
for
toilet
paper
it
was
senseless
to
deny
these
necessities
it
is
enough
to
imprison
people
why
seek
to
degrade
them
utterly
the
third
afternoon
we
were
mysteriously
summoned
into
the
presence
of
superintendent
whittaker
he
seemed
warm
and
cordial
we
were
ordered
drawn
up
in
a
ladies
there
is
a
rumor
that
you
may
be
pardoned
he
began
by
whom
asked
one
for
what
asked
another
we
are
innocent
women
there
is
nothing
to
pardon
us
for
i
have
come
to
ask
you
what
you
would
do
if
the
president
pardoned
you
we
would
refuse
to
accept
it
came
the
ready
response
from
several
i
shall
leave
you
for
a
while
to
consider
this
mind
i
have
not
yet
received
information
of
a
pardon
but
i
have
been
asked
to
ascertain
your
attitude
our
consultation
was
brief
we
were
of
one
mind
we
were
unanimous
in
wishing
to
reject
a
pardon
for
a
crime
which
we
had
never
committed
we
said
so
with
some
spirit
when
whittaker
returned
for
our
decision
you
have
no
choice
you
are
obliged
to
accept
a
pardon
that
settled
it
and
we
waited
that
the
protest
on
the
outside
had
been
strong
enough
to
precipitate
action
from
the
government
was
the
subject
of
our
conversation
evidently
it
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
force
action
on
the
suffrage
amendment
but
it
was
forcing
action
and
that
was
important
whittaker
returned
triumphant
ladies
you
are
pardoned
by
the
president
you
are
free
to
go
as
soon
as
you
have
taken
off
your
prison
clothes
and
put
on
your
own
it
was
sad
to
leave
the
other
prisoners
behind
especially
pathetic
were
the
girls
who
helped
us
with
our
clothes
they
whispered
such
eager
appeals
in
our
ears
telling
us
of
their
drastic
sentences
for
trifling
offenses
and
of
the
cruel
punishments
it
was
hard
to
resist
digressing
into
some
effort
at
prison
reform
that
way
lay
our
instincts
our
reason
told
us
that
we
must
first
change
the
status
of
women
as
we
were
leaving
the
workhouse
to
return
to
washington
we
had
an
unexpected
revelation
of
the
attitude
of
officialdom
toward
our
campaign
addressing
miss
lucy
burns
who
had
arrived
to
assist
us
in
getting
on
our
way
superintendent
whittaker
in
an
almost
unbelievable
rage
said
now
that
you
women
are
going
away
i
have
something
to
say
and
i
want
to
say
it
to
you
the
next
lot
of
women
who
come
here
wo
be
treated
with
the
same
consideration
that
these
women
were
i
will
show
later
on
how
he
made
good
this
terrible
threat
receiving
a
presidential
pardon
through
the
attorney
general
had
its
amusing
aspect
my
comrades
shared
this
amusement
when
i
told
them
the
following
incident
on
the
day
after
our
arrest
i
was
having
tea
at
the
chevy
chase
country
club
in
washington
quite
casually
a
gentleman
introduced
me
to
gregory
the
attorney
general
i
see
you
were
mixed
up
with
the
suffragettes
yesterday
was
the
attorney
general
first
remark
to
the
gentleman
and
before
the
latter
could
explain
that
he
had
settled
accounts
quietly
but
efficiently
with
a
hoodlum
who
was
attempting
to
trip
the
women
up
on
their
march
the
chief
law
officer
of
the
united
states
contributed
this
important
suggestion
you
know
what
i
do
if
i
was
those
policemen
i
just
take
a
hose
out
with
me
and
when
the
women
came
out
with
their
banners
why
i
just
squirt
the
hose
on
but
gregory
yes
sir
if
you
can
just
make
what
a
woman
does
look
ridiculous
you
can
sure
kill
it
but
attorney
general
what
right
would
the
police
have
to
assault
these
or
any
other
women
the
gentleman
managed
finally
to
interpolate
denoting
great
surprise
came
from
the
attorney
general
as
he
looked
to
me
for
reassurance
his
expectant
look
vanished
when
i
said
gregory
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
it
might
make
the
government
look
ridiculous
instead
of
the
women
you
can
imagine
bow
the
easy
manner
of
one
who
is
sure
of
his
audience
melted
from
his
face
this
is
one
of
the
women
arrested
yesterday
continued
the
gentleman
while
the
attorney
general
smothered
a
well
i
be
i
am
out
on
bail
i
we
go
to
jail
it
is
all
prearranged
you
understand
the
trial
is
merely
a
matter
of
form
the
highest
law
officer
of
the
land
fled
gurgling
s
the
day
following
our
release
j
hopkins
carried
a
picket
banner
to
the
gates
of
the
white
house
to
test
the
validity
of
the
pardon
her
banner
read
we
do
not
ask
pardon
for
ourselves
but
justice
for
all
american
women
a
curious
crowd
as
large
as
had
collected
on
those
days
when
the
police
arrested
women
for
obstructing
traffic
stood
watching
the
lone
picket
the
president
passed
through
the
gates
and
saluted
the
police
did
not
interfere
daily
picketing
was
resumed
and
no
arrests
followed
for
the
moment
it
was
now
august
three
months
since
the
senate
suffrage
committee
authorized
its
chairman
jones
to
report
the
measure
to
the
senate
for
action
jones
said
however
that
he
was
too
busy
to
make
a
report
he
wanted
to
make
a
particularly
brilliant
one
one
that
would
be
a
contribution
to
the
cause
that
he
did
not
approve
of
picketing
but
that
he
would
report
the
measure
in
a
reasonable
time
so
much
for
the
situation
in
the
senate
from
the
house
we
gathered
some
interesting
evidence
we
reminded
webb
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
that
out
of
a
total
membership
of
men
on
his
committee
twelve
were
democrats
of
whom
were
opposed
to
the
measure
we
reminded
him
that
the
republicans
on
the
committee
were
for
action
webb
wrote
in
answer
the
democratic
caucus
passed
a
resolution
that
only
war
emergency
measures
would
be
considered
during
this
extra
session
and
that
the
president
might
designate
from
time
to
time
special
legislation
which
he
regarded
as
war
legislation
and
such
would
be
acted
on
by
the
house
the
president
not
having
designated
woman
suffrage
and
national
prohibition
so
far
as
war
measures
the
judiciary
committee
up
to
this
time
has
not
felt
warranted
under
the
caucus
rule
in
reporting
either
of
these
measures
if
the
president
should
request
either
or
both
of
them
as
war
measures
then
i
think
the
committee
would
attempt
to
take
some
action
on
them
promptly
so
you
see
after
all
it
is
important
to
your
cause
to
make
the
president
see
that
woman
suffrage
comes
within
the
rules
laid
down
here
was
a
frank
admission
of
the
assumption
upon
which
women
had
gone
to
the
president
was
responsible
for
action
on
the
amendment
now
that
we
were
again
allowed
to
picket
the
white
house
the
republicans
seized
the
opportunity
legitimately
to
embarrass
their
opponents
by
precipitating
a
bitter
debate
senator
cummins
of
iowa
republican
member
of
the
suffrage
committee
moved
as
had
mann
in
the
house
at
an
earlier
date
to
discharge
the
suffrage
committee
for
failing
to
make
the
report
authorized
by
the
entire
committee
cummins
said
among
other
things
i
look
upon
the
resolution
as
definitely
and
certainly
a
war
measure
there
is
nothing
that
this
country
could
do
which
would
strengthen
it
more
than
to
give
the
disfranchised
women
the
opportunity
to
vote
last
week
i
went
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
and
told
him
that
we
had
finished
the
hearings
reached
a
conclusion
and
that
it
was
our
bounden
duty
to
make
the
report
to
the
senate
i
asked
him
if
he
would
not
call
a
meeting
of
the
committee
he
said
that
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
had
some
other
engagements
which
would
prevent
a
meeting
of
the
committee
senator
cummins
explained
that
he
finally
got
the
promise
of
the
chairman
that
a
meeting
of
the
committee
would
be
called
on
a
given
date
when
it
was
not
called
he
made
his
motion
chairman
jones
made
some
feeble
remarks
and
some
evasive
excuses
which
meant
nothing
and
which
only
further
aroused
republican
friends
of
the
measure
on
the
committee
senator
gronna
of
north
dakota
republican
interrupted
italics
are
mine
him
with
the
direct
question
i
ask
the
chairman
of
this
committee
why
this
joint
resolution
has
not
been
reported
the
senator
who
is
chairman
of
the
committee
i
suppose
knows
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
people
of
the
entire
country
are
anxious
to
have
this
joint
resolution
submitted
and
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
vote
upon
it
senator
johnson
of
california
republican
proposed
that
chairman
jones
consent
to
call
the
committee
together
to
consider
reporting
out
the
bill
which
senator
jones
flatly
refused
to
do
senator
jones
of
washington
another
republican
member
of
the
committee
added
i
agree
with
the
senator
from
iowa
that
this
is
a
war
measure
and
ought
to
be
considered
as
such
at
this
time
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
very
consistently
talk
democracy
while
disfranchising
the
better
half
of
our
may
not
approve
of
the
action
of
the
women
picketing
the
white
house
but
neither
do
i
approve
of
what
i
consider
the
lawless
action
toward
these
women
in
connection
with
the
picketing
i
do
not
want
to
think
the
chairman
does
not
desire
to
call
the
committee
together
because
of
some
influence
outside
of
congress
as
some
have
suggested
at
this
point
senator
hollis
of
new
hampshire
democrat
arose
to
say
there
is
a
small
but
very
active
group
of
women
suffragists
who
have
acted
in
such
a
way
that
some
who
are
ardently
in
favor
of
woman
suffrage
believe
that
their
action
should
not
be
encouraged
by
making
a
favorable
report
at
this
time
senator
johnson
protested
at
this
point
but
senator
hollis
continued
to
discharge
the
committee
would
focus
the
attention
of
the
country
upon
the
action
and
would
give
undue
weight
to
what
has
been
done
by
the
active
group
of
woman
suffragists
i
think
that
any
student
of
psychology
will
acknowledge
that
our
picketing
had
stimulated
action
in
congress
and
that
what
was
now
needed
was
some
still
more
provocative
action
from
us
chapter
august
riots
imprisoning
women
had
met
with
considerable
public
disapproval
and
attendant
political
embarrassment
to
the
administration
that
the
presidential
pardon
would
end
this
embarrassment
was
doubtless
the
hope
of
the
administration
the
pickets
however
returned
to
their
posts
in
steadily
increasing
numbers
their
presence
at
the
gates
was
desired
by
the
administration
no
more
now
than
it
had
been
before
the
arrests
and
imprisonments
but
they
had
found
no
way
to
rid
themselves
of
the
pickets
and
as
another
month
of
picketing
drew
to
an
end
the
administration
ventured
to
try
other
ways
to
stop
it
and
with
it
the
consequent
embarrassment
their
methods
became
physically
more
brutal
and
politically
more
stupid
their
conduct
became
lawless
in
the
extreme
meanwhile
the
president
had
drafted
the
young
men
of
america
in
their
millions
to
die
on
foreign
soil
for
foreign
democracy
he
had
issued
a
special
appeal
to
women
to
give
their
work
their
treasure
and
their
sons
to
this
enterprise
at
the
same
time
his
now
gigantic
figure
stood
obstinately
across
the
path
to
our
main
objective
it
was
our
daily
task
to
keep
vividly
in
his
mind
that
objective
it
was
our
responsibility
to
compel
decisive
action
from
him
using
the
return
of
envoy
root
from
his
mission
to
russia
as
another
dramatic
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
president
we
took
to
the
picket
line
these
mottoes
to
envoy
root
you
say
that
america
must
throw
its
manhood
to
the
support
of
liberty
whose
liberty
this
nation
is
not
free
twenty
million
women
are
denied
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
right
to
representation
in
their
own
government
tell
the
president
that
he
can
not
fight
against
liberty
at
home
while
he
tells
us
to
fight
for
liberty
abroad
tell
him
to
make
america
safe
for
democracy
before
he
asks
the
mothers
of
america
to
throw
their
sons
to
the
support
of
democracy
in
europe
ask
him
how
he
can
refuse
liberty
to
american
citizens
when
he
is
forcing
millions
of
american
boys
out
of
their
country
to
die
for
liberty
at
no
time
during
the
entire
picketing
was
the
traffic
on
pennsylvania
avenue
so
completely
obstructed
as
it
was
for
the
two
hours
during
which
this
banner
made
its
appearance
on
the
line
police
captains
who
three
weeks
before
were
testifying
that
the
police
could
not
manage
the
crowds
placidly
looked
on
while
these
new
crowds
increased
we
did
not
regard
wilson
as
our
president
we
felt
that
he
had
neither
political
nor
moral
claim
to
our
allegiance
war
had
been
made
without
our
consent
the
war
would
be
finished
and
very
likely
a
bad
peace
would
be
written
without
our
consent
our
fight
was
becoming
increasingly
might
almost
say
desperate
here
we
were
a
band
of
women
fighting
with
banners
in
the
midst
of
a
world
armed
to
the
teeth
and
so
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
understand
how
high
spirited
women
grew
more
resentful
unwilling
to
be
a
party
to
the
president
hypocrisy
the
hypocrisy
so
eager
to
sacrifice
life
without
stint
to
the
vague
hope
of
liberty
abroad
while
refusing
to
assist
in
the
peaceful
legislative
steps
which
would
lead
to
in
our
own
country
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
president
constant
oratory
on
freedom
and
democracy
moved
them
to
scorn
they
were
stung
into
a
protest
so
militant
as
to
shock
not
only
the
president
but
the
public
we
inscribed
on
our
banner
what
countless
american
had
long
thought
in
their
hearts
the
truth
was
not
pleasant
but
it
had
to
be
told
we
submitted
to
the
world
through
the
picket
line
this
question
kaiser
wilson
have
you
forgotten
how
you
sympathized
with
the
poor
germans
because
they
were
not
self
governed
american
women
are
not
take
the
beam
out
of
your
own
eye
we
did
not
expect
public
sympathy
at
this
point
we
knew
that
not
even
the
members
of
congress
who
had
occasionally
in
debate
but
more
frequently
in
their
cloak
rooms
and
often
to
us
privately
called
the
president
autocrat
kaiser
ruler
king
czar
would
approve
our
telling
the
truth
publicly
nor
was
it
to
be
expected
that
eager
young
boys
all
agog
to
fight
germans
would
be
averse
to
attacking
women
in
the
meantime
they
were
out
to
fight
and
such
was
the
public
hysteria
that
it
did
not
exactly
matter
whom
they
fought
and
so
those
excited
boys
of
the
army
and
navy
attacked
the
women
and
the
banner
the
banner
was
destroyed
another
was
brought
up
to
take
its
place
this
one
met
the
same
fate
meanwhile
a
crowd
was
assembling
in
front
of
the
white
house
either
to
watch
or
to
assist
in
the
attacks
at
the
very
moment
when
one
banner
was
being
snatched
away
and
destroyed
president
and
wilson
passed
through
the
gates
on
their
way
to
a
military
review
at
fort
myer
the
president
saw
american
women
being
attacked
while
the
police
refused
them
protection
not
a
move
was
made
by
the
police
to
control
the
growing
crowd
such
inaction
is
always
a
signal
for
more
violence
on
the
part
of
rowdies
as
the
throng
moved
to
and
fro
between
the
white
house
and
our
headquarters
immediately
opposite
so
many
banners
were
destroyed
that
finally
miss
lucy
burns
miss
virginia
arnold
and
miss
elizabeth
stuyvesant
took
those
remaining
to
the
second
and
third
floor
balconies
of
our
building
and
hung
them
out
at
this
point
there
was
not
a
picket
left
on
the
street
the
crowd
was
clearly
obstructing
the
traffic
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
move
them
back
or
to
protect
the
women
some
of
whom
were
attacked
by
sailors
on
their
own
doorsteps
the
two
police
officers
present
watched
without
interference
while
three
sailors
brought
a
ladder
from
the
belasco
theater
in
the
same
block
leaned
it
against
the
side
of
the
cameron
house
the
headquarters
climbed
up
to
the
second
floor
balcony
mounted
the
iron
railing
and
tore
down
all
banners
and
the
american
flag
one
sailor
administered
a
severe
blow
in
the
face
with
his
clenched
fist
upon
miss
georgina
sturgis
of
washington
why
did
you
do
that
she
demanded
the
man
halted
for
a
brief
instant
in
obvious
amazement
and
said
i
do
know
and
with
a
violent
wrench
he
tore
the
banner
from
her
hands
and
ran
down
the
ladder
the
narrow
balcony
was
the
scene
of
intense
excitement
but
for
miss
burns
superb
strength
she
would
have
been
dragged
over
the
railing
of
the
balcony
to
be
plunged
to
the
ground
the
mob
watched
with
fascination
while
she
swayed
to
and
fro
in
her
wrestle
with
two
young
sailors
and
still
no
attempt
by
the
police
to
quell
the
riot
the
climax
came
when
in
the
late
afternoon
a
bullet
was
fired
through
one
of
the
heavy
glass
windows
of
the
second
floor
embedding
itself
in
the
ceiling
the
bullet
grazed
past
the
head
of
ella
morton
dean
of
montana
captain
flather
of
the
precinct
with
two
detectives
later
examined
the
holes
and
declared
they
had
been
made
by
a
caliber
revolver
but
no
attempt
was
ever
made
to
find
the
man
who
had
drawn
the
revolver
meanwhile
eggs
and
tomatoes
were
hurled
at
our
fresh
banners
flying
from
the
flag
poles
on
the
building
finally
police
reserves
were
summoned
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
crowd
was
pushed
back
and
the
street
cleared
thinking
now
that
they
could
rely
on
the
protection
of
the
police
the
women
started
with
their
banners
for
the
white
house
but
the
police
looked
on
while
all
the
banners
were
destroyed
a
few
paces
from
headquarters
more
banners
went
out
white
and
gold
ones
they
too
were
destroyed
before
they
reached
the
white
house
this
entire
spectacle
was
enacted
on
august
within
a
throw
of
the
white
house
miss
paul
summed
up
the
situation
when
she
said
the
situation
now
existing
in
washington
exists
because
president
wilson
permits
it
orders
were
first
handed
down
to
the
police
to
arrest
suffragists
the
clamor
over
their
imprisonments
made
this
position
untenable
the
police
were
then
ordered
to
protect
suffragists
they
were
then
ordered
to
attack
suffragists
they
have
now
been
ordered
to
encourage
irresponsible
crowds
to
attack
suffragists
no
police
head
would
dare
so
to
besmirch
his
record
without
orders
from
his
responsible
chief
the
responsible
chief
in
the
national
capital
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
shortly
after
the
incident
of
the
kaiser
banner
i
was
speaking
in
louisville
kentucky
the
auditorium
was
packed
and
overflowing
with
men
and
women
who
had
come
to
hear
the
story
of
the
pickets
up
to
this
time
we
had
very
few
members
in
kentucky
and
had
anticipated
in
this
southern
state
part
of
president
wilson
stronghold
that
our
committee
would
meet
with
no
enthusiasm
and
possibly
with
warm
hostility
i
had
related
briefly
the
incidents
leading
up
to
the
picketing
and
the
government
suppressions
i
was
rather
cautiously
approaching
the
subject
of
the
kaiser
banner
feeling
timid
and
hesitant
wondering
how
this
vast
audience
of
southerners
would
take
it
slowly
i
read
the
inscription
on
the
famous
banner
kaiser
wilson
have
you
forgotten
how
you
sympathized
with
the
poor
germans
because
they
were
not
twenty
million
american
women
are
not
take
the
beam
out
of
your
own
eye
i
hardly
reached
the
last
word
still
wondering
what
the
intensely
silent
audience
would
do
when
a
terrific
outburst
of
applause
mingled
with
shouts
of
good
good
he
is
he
is
came
to
my
amazed
ears
as
the
applause
died
down
there
was
almost
universal
laughter
instead
of
the
painstaking
and
eloquent
explanation
which
i
was
prepared
to
offer
i
had
only
to
join
in
their
laughter
a
few
minutes
later
a
telegram
was
brought
to
the
platform
announcing
further
arrests
i
read
six
more
women
sentenced
to
days
in
occoquan
workhouse
instant
cries
of
shame
shame
it
an
outrage
scores
of
men
and
two
women
were
on
their
feet
calling
for
the
passage
of
a
resolution
denouncing
the
administration
policy
of
persecution
the
motion
of
condemnation
was
put
it
seemed
as
if
the
entire
audience
seconded
it
it
went
through
instantly
unanimously
and
again
with
prolonged
shouts
and
applause
the
meeting
continued
and
i
shall
never
forget
that
audience
it
lingered
to
a
late
hour
almost
to
midnight
asking
questions
making
brief
testimonials
from
the
floor
with
almost
evangelical
fervor
improvised
collection
baskets
were
piled
high
with
bills
women
volunteered
for
picket
duty
and
certain
imprisonment
and
the
following
day
a
delegation
left
for
washington
i
cite
this
experience
of
mine
because
it
was
typical
every
one
who
went
through
the
country
telling
the
story
had
similar
experiences
at
this
time
indignation
was
swift
and
hot
our
mass
meetings
everywhere
became
meetings
of
protest
during
the
entire
campaign
and
resolutions
of
protest
which
always
went
immediately
by
wire
from
such
meetings
to
the
president
his
cabinet
and
to
his
leaders
in
congress
of
course
created
increasing
uneasiness
in
democratic
circles
on
august
the
pickets
again
attempted
to
take
their
posts
on
the
line
on
this
day
one
lettered
banner
and
fifty
purple
white
and
gold
flags
were
destroyed
by
a
mob
led
by
sailors
in
uniform
alice
paul
was
knocked
down
three
times
by
a
sailor
in
uniform
and
dragged
the
width
of
the
white
house
sidewalk
in
his
frenzied
attempt
to
tear
off
leer
suffrage
sash
miss
katharine
morey
of
boston
was
also
knocked
to
the
pavement
by
a
sailor
who
took
her
flag
and
then
darted
off
into
the
crowd
miss
elizabeth
stuyvesant
was
struck
by
a
soldier
in
uniform
and
her
blouse
torn
from
her
body
miss
maud
jamison
of
virginia
was
knocked
down
and
dragged
along
the
sidewalk
miss
beulah
amidon
of
north
dakota
was
knocked
down
by
a
sailor
in
the
midst
of
these
riotous
scenes
a
washington
correspondent
was
emerging
from
the
white
house
after
an
interview
with
the
president
cart
grayson
the
physician
accompanying
him
to
the
door
advised
you
had
better
go
out
the
side
entrance
those
damned
women
are
in
the
front
in
spite
of
this
advice
the
correspondent
made
his
exit
through
the
same
gate
by
which
he
had
entered
and
just
in
time
to
ward
off
an
attack
by
a
sailor
on
one
of
the
frailest
girls
in
the
group
the
administration
in
its
desperation
ordered
the
police
to
lawlessness
on
august
fifty
policemen
led
the
mob
in
attacking
the
women
hands
were
bruised
and
arms
twisted
police
officers
and
plainclothes
men
two
civilians
who
tried
to
rescue
the
women
from
the
attacks
of
the
police
were
arrested
the
police
fell
upon
these
young
women
with
more
brutality
even
than
the
mobs
they
had
before
encouraged
lettered
banners
and
party
flags
were
destroyed
by
mobs
and
police
on
this
afternoon
as
the
crowd
grew
more
dense
the
police
temporarily
retired
from
the
attack
when
their
activities
had
summoned
a
sufficiently
large
and
infuriated
mob
they
would
rest
and
so
the
passions
of
the
mob
continued
unchecked
upon
these
irrepressible
women
and
from
day
to
day
the
administration
gave
its
orders
finding
that
riots
and
mob
attacks
had
not
terrorized
the
pickets
the
administration
decided
again
to
arrest
the
women
in
the
hope
of
ending
the
agitation
having
lost
public
sympathy
through
workhouse
sentences
having
won
it
back
by
pardoning
the
women
the
administration
felt
it
could
afford
to
risk
losing
it
again
or
rather
felt
that
it
had
supplied
itself
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
and
so
on
the
third
day
of
the
riotous
attacks
when
it
was
clear
that
the
pickets
would
persist
the
chief
of
police
called
at
headquarters
to
announce
to
miss
paul
that
orders
have
been
changed
and
henceforth
women
carrying
banners
will
be
arrested
meanwhile
the
pickets
heard
officers
shout
to
civilian
friends
as
they
come
back
at
four
members
of
the
daily
mob
announced
at
the
noon
hour
in
various
nearby
restaurants
that
the
suffs
will
be
arrested
at
four
is
the
hour
the
government
clerks
begin
to
swarm
homewards
the
choice
of
this
hour
by
the
police
to
arrest
the
women
would
enable
them
to
have
a
large
crowd
passing
the
white
house
gates
to
lend
color
to
the
fiction
that
pickets
were
blocking
the
traffic
throughout
the
earlier
part
of
the
afternoon
the
silent
sentinels
stood
unmolested
carrying
these
mottoes
england
and
russia
are
enfranchising
women
in
how
long
must
women
wait
fob
liberty
the
government
orders
our
banners
destroyed
because
they
tell
the
truth
at
four
the
threatened
arrests
took
place
the
women
arrested
were
miss
lavinia
dock
of
pennsylvania
miss
edna
dixon
of
washington
a
young
public
school
teacher
miss
natalie
gray
of
colorado
mrs
win
upton
watson
and
miss
lucy
ewing
of
chicago
and
miss
catherine
flanagan
of
connecticut
exactly
forty
minutes
were
allowed
for
the
trial
of
these
six
women
one
police
officer
testified
that
they
were
obstructing
traffic
none
of
the
facts
of
the
hideous
and
cruel
manhandling
by
the
mobs
and
police
officers
was
allowed
to
be
brought
out
nothing
the
women
could
say
mattered
the
judge
nounced
thirty
days
in
occoquan
workhouse
in
lieu
of
a
fine
and
so
this
little
handful
of
women
practically
all
of
them
tiny
and
frail
of
physique
began
the
cruel
sentence
of
days
in
the
workhouse
while
their
cowardly
assailants
were
not
even
reprimanded
nor
were
those
who
destroyed
over
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
banners
apprehended
the
riots
had
attracted
sufficient
attention
to
cause
some
anxiety
in
administration
circles
protests
against
us
and
others
against
the
rioters
pressed
upon
them
congress
was
provoked
into
a
little
activity
activity
which
reflected
some
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
arresting
women
without
some
warrant
in
law
two
attempts
were
made
neither
of
which
was
successful
to
give
the
administration
more
power
and
more
law
senator
culberson
of
texas
democrat
offered
a
bill
authorizing
president
wilson
at
any
time
to
prohibit
any
person
from
approaching
or
entering
any
place
in
short
blanket
authority
granting
the
president
or
his
officials
limitless
power
over
the
actions
of
human
beings
realizing
that
this
could
be
used
to
prohibit
picketing
the
white
house
we
appeared
before
a
committee
hearing
on
the
bill
and
spoke
against
it
the
committee
did
not
have
the
boldness
to
report
such
a
bill
senator
myers
of
montana
an
influential
member
of
the
democratic
majority
introduced
into
the
senate
a
few
days
later
a
resolution
making
it
illegal
to
picket
the
white
house
the
shamelessness
of
admitting
to
the
world
that
acts
for
which
women
had
been
repeatedly
sentenced
to
jail
and
for
which
women
were
at
that
moment
lying
in
prison
were
so
legal
as
to
make
necessary
a
special
act
of
congress
against
them
was
appalling
the
administration
policy
seemed
to
be
let
us
put
women
in
jail
us
enact
a
law
to
keep
them
there
afterwards
this
tilt
between
senator
brandegee
of
connecticut
antisuffrage
republican
and
senator
myers
suffrage
democrat
took
place
when
myer
presented
his
bill
brandegee
was
there
any
defect
in
the
legal
proceedings
by
which
these
trouble
makers
were
sentenced
and
put
in
jail
a
few
weeks
ago
myers
none
that
i
know
of
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
pass
upon
that
i
do
not
believe
any
was
claimed
brandegee
inasmuch
as
the
law
was
sufficient
to
land
them
in
jail
i
fail
to
see
why
additional
legislation
is
necessary
on
the
subject
myers
there
seems
to
be
a
doubt
in
the
mind
of
some
whether
the
present
law
is
sufficient
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
put
beyond
doubt
i
think
the
laws
are
not
stringent
or
severe
enough
brandegee
they
were
stringent
enough
to
land
the
malefactors
in
jail
in
spite
of
senator
myers
impassioned
appeal
to
his
colleagues
be
was
unable
to
command
any
support
for
his
bill
i
quote
this
from
his
speech
in
the
senate
august
myers
president
i
wish
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
bill
i
have
just
introduced
it
is
intended
for
the
enactment
of
better
and
more
adequate
legislation
to
prevent
the
infamous
outrageous
scandalous
and
i
think
almost
treasonable
actions
that
have
been
going
on
around
the
white
house
for
months
past
which
president
of
the
united
states
have
been
a
gross
insult
to
the
and
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
mean
the
picketing
of
the
white
house
these
disgusting
proceedings
have
been
going
on
for
months
and
if
there
is
no
adequate
law
to
stop
them
i
think
there
ought
to
be
i
believe
the
president
in
the
generosity
of
his
heart
erred
when
he
pardoned
some
of
the
women
who
have
been
conducting
these
proceedings
after
they
had
been
sentenced
to
days
in
the
workhouse
i
believe
they
deserved
the
sentence
and
they
ought
to
have
been
compelled
to
serve
it
i
for
one
am
not
satisfied
longer
to
sit
here
idly
day
by
day
and
submit
to
having
the
president
of
the
united
states
insulted
with
impunity
before
the
people
of
the
country
and
before
all
the
world
it
is
a
shame
and
reproach
i
hope
this
bill
will
receive
careful
consideration
and
that
it
may
be
enacted
into
law
and
may
be
found
an
adequate
preventive
and
punishment
for
such
conduct
this
bill
which
died
a
death
is
so
amusing
as
to
warrant
reproduction
although
lamenting
our
comparison
between
the
president
and
the
kaiser
it
will
be
seen
that
senator
myers
brought
forth
a
thoroughly
prussian
document
a
bill
for
the
better
protection
and
enforcement
of
peace
and
order
and
the
public
welfare
in
the

voices
were
raised
in
our
behalf
also
and
among
them
i
note
the
following
letter
written
to
major
pullman
by
gilson
gardner
raymond
pullman
chief
of
police
washington
my
dear
pullman
i
am
writing
as
an
old
friend
to
urge
you
to
get
right
in
this
matter
of
arresting
the
suffrage
pickets
of
course
the
only
way
for
you
to
get
right
is
to
resign
it
has
apparently
become
impossible
for
you
to
stay
in
office
and
do
your
duty
the
alternative
is
obvious
you
must
see
pullman
that
you
can
not
be
right
in
what
you
have
done
in
this
matter
you
have
given
the
pickets
adequate
protection
but
you
have
arrested
them
and
had
them
sent
to
jail
and
the
workhouse
you
have
permitted
the
crowd
to
mob
them
and
then
you
have
had
your
officers
do
much
the
same
thing
by
forcibly
taking
their
banners
from
them
in
some
of
the
actions
you
must
have
been
wrong
if
it
was
right
to
give
them
protection
and
let
them
stand
at
the
white
house
for
five
months
both
before
and
after
the
war
it
was
not
right
to
do
what
you
did
later
you
say
that
it
was
not
right
when
you
were
lenient
and
gave
them
protection
you
can
not
mean
that
the
rightness
or
wrongness
must
be
a
matter
of
law
not
of
personal
discretion
and
for
you
to
attempt
to
substitute
your
discretion
is
to
set
up
a
little
autocracy
m
place
of
the
settled
laws
of
the
land
this
would
justify
a
charge
of
kaiserism
right
here
in
our
capital
city
the
truth
is
pullman
you
were
right
when
you
gave
these
women
protection
that
is
what
the
police
are
for
when
the
distinguished
journalist
who
went
to
africa
to
meet
theodore
roosevelt
and
accompanied
him
on
his
return
journey
to
america
there
are
riots
they
are
supposed
to
quell
them
not
by
quelling
the
proximate
cause
but
by
quelling
the
rioters
i
know
your
police
officers
now
quite
well
and
know
that
they
are
most
happy
when
they
are
permitted
to
do
their
duty
they
did
not
like
the
dirty
business
of
permitting
a
lot
of
sailors
and
street
rifraff
to
rough
the
girls
all
that
went
against
the
grain
but
when
you
let
them
protect
the
pickets
as
you
did
march
third
when
a
thousand
women
marched
around
and
around
the
white
house
the
officers
were
as
contented
as
they
were
efficient
washington
has
a
good
police
force
and
there
has
never
been
a
minute
when
they
could
not
have
scattered
any
group
gathered
at
the
white
house
gates
and
given
perfect
protection
to
the
women
standing
there
you
know
why
they
did
not
do
their
duty
in
excusing
what
you
have
done
you
say
that
the
women
carried
banners
with
offensive
inscriptions
on
them
you
refer
to
the
fact
that
they
have
addressed
the
president
as
kaiser
wilson
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
an
arrest
you
have
the
arrests
now
number
more
than
been
for
carrying
one
of
those
offensive
banners
the
women
were
carrying
merely
the
suffrage
colors
or
quotations
from
president
wilson
writings
but
suppose
the
banners
were
offensive
who
made
you
censor
of
banners
the
law
gives
you
no
such
power
even
when
you
go
through
the
farce
of
a
police
court
trial
the
charge
is
obstructing
traffic
which
shows
conclusively
that
you
are
not
willing
to
go
into
court
on
the
real
issue
no
as
chief
of
police
you
have
no
more
right
to
complain
of
the
sentiments
of
a
banner
than
you
have
of
the
sentiments
in
an
editorial
in
the
washington
post
and
you
have
no
more
right
to
arrest
the
than
you
have
to
arrest
the
owner
of
the
washington
post
congress
refused
to
pass
a
press
censorship
law
there
are
certain
lingering
traditions
to
the
effect
that
a
people
liberties
are
closely
bound
up
with
the
right
to
talk
things
out
and
those
who
are
enlightened
know
that
the
only
proper
answer
to
words
is
words
when
force
is
opposed
to
words
there
is
ground
for
the
charge
of
kaiserism
there
was
just
one
thing
for
you
to
have
done
pullman
and
that
was
to
give
full
and
adequate
protection
to
these
women
no
matter
what
banners
they
carried
or
what
ideas
their
banners
expressed
if
there
is
any
law
that
can
be
invoked
against
the
wording
of
the
banners
it
was
the
business
of
others
in
the
government
to
start
the
legal
machinery
which
would
abate
them
it
was
not
lawful
to
abate
them
by
mob
violence
or
by
arrests
and
if
those
in
authority
over
you
were
not
willing
that
you
thus
do
your
duty
it
was
up
to
you
to
resign
after
all
it
would
not
be
such
a
terrible
thing
pullman
for
you
to
give
up
being
chief
of
police
particularly
when
you
are
not
permitted
to
be
chief
of
police
but
must
yield
your
judgment
to
the
district
commissioners
who
have
yielded
their
judgment
to
the
white
house
being
chief
of
police
under
such
circumstances
can
hardly
be
worth
while
you
are
a
young
man
and
the
world
is
full
of
places
for
young
men
with
courage
enough
to
save
their
respect
at
the
expense
of
their
jobs
you
did
that
once
in
the
days
why
not
now
come
out
and
help
make
the
fight
which
must
be
made
to
recover
and
protect
the
liberties
which
are
being
filched
from
us
here
at
home
there
is
a
real
fight
looming
up
for
real
democracy
you
will
not
be
alone
there
are
a
lot
of
fine
young
men
vigorous
and
patriotic
in
and
out
of
the
administration
who
are
preparing
for
this
fight
yours
will
not
be
the
only
resignation
but
why
not
be
among
the
first
do
wait
let
them
have
your
resignation
now
and
let
me
be
the
first
to
welcome
and
congratulate
you
sincerely
signed
gilson
gardner
representative
john
baer
of
north
dakota
having
witnessed
for
himself
the
riotous
scenes
immediately
introduced
into
the
house
a
resolution
demanding
an
investigation
of
conditions
in
the
capital
which
permitted
mobs
to
attack
women
this
too
went
to
certain
death
between
the
members
who
did
not
dare
denounce
the
administration
and
the
others
who
did
dare
denounce
the
women
we
had
to
stand
quite
see
appendix
for
full
text
of
resolution
solidly
on
our
own
program
and
do
our
best
to
keep
them
nervous
over
the
next
step
in
the
agitation
the
press
throughout
the
entire
country
at
this
time
protested
against
mob
violence
and
the
severe
sentences
pronounced
upon
the
women
who
had
attempted
to
hold
their
banners
steadfast
the
washington
herald
august
printed
the
following
editorial
there
is
an
echo
of
the
president
phrase
about
the
firm
hand
of
stern
repression
in
the
arrest
conviction
and
jailing
of
the
six
suffragists
a
touch
of
ruthlessness
in
their
incarceration
at
occoquan
along
with
women
of
the
street
pickpockets
and
other
flotsam
and
jetsam
still
the
suffragists
are
not
looking
for
sympathy
and
it
need
not
be
wasted
upon
them
the
police
have
arrived
at
a
policy
although
no
one
knows
whether
it
will
be
sufficiently
stable
and
consistent
to
last
out
the
week
washington
is
grateful
that
the
disgraceful
period
of
rioting
and
mob
violence
in
front
of
the
white
house
is
at
an
end
and
another
crisis
in
the
militant
crusade
to
bring
the
susan
anthony
amendment
before
congress
has
been
reached
what
is
the
next
step
no
one
knows
picketing
doubtless
will
continue
or
an
effort
will
be
made
to
continue
it
and
militancy
if
the
police
continue
to
arrest
instead
of
giving
the
women
protection
will
pass
into
a
new
phase
the
suffragists
as
well
as
the
public
at
large
are
thankful
that
the
police
department
has
finally
determined
to
arrest
the
pickets
instead
of
allowing
them
to
be
mobbed
by
hoodlums
the
public
eye
will
be
on
occoquan
for
the
next
few
weeks
to
find
out
how
these
women
bear
up
under
the
spartan
treatment
that
is
in
store
for
them
if
they
have
deliberately
sought
martyrdom
as
some
critics
have
been
unkind
enough
to
suggest
they
have
it
now
and
if
their
campaign
in
the
opinion
of
perhaps
the
great
majority
of
the
public
has
been
misguided
admiration
for
their
pluck
will
not
be
withheld
the
boston
journal
of
august
said
in
an
editorial
written
by
herbert
pinkham
that
higher
authorities
than
the
washington
police
were
responsible
for
the
amazing
policy
of
rough
house
employed
against
the
suffrage
pickets
has
been
suspected
from
the
very
beginning
police
power
in
washington
is
sufficient
to
protect
a
handful
of
women
against
a
whole
phalanx
of
excited
or
inspired
government
clerks
and
uniformed
hoodlums
if
that
power
were
used
in
our
nation
capital
women
have
been
knocked
down
and
dragged
through
the
streets
by
government
sailors
in
uniform
the
police
are
strangely
absent
at
such
moments
as
a
rule
and
arrive
only
in
time
to
arrest
a
few
women
perhaps
the
inscriptions
on
the
suffrage
banners
were
not
tactful
it
is
sometimes
awkward
indeed
to
quote
the
speeches
after
the
speeches
have
grown
cold
also
a
too
vigorous
use
of
the
word
democracy
is
distasteful
to
some
government
dignitaries
it
seems
but
right
or
wrong
the
suffragists
at
washington
are
entitled
to
police
protection
even
though
in
the
minds
of
the
administration
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
ballot
perhaps
even
in
america
we
must
have
a
law
forbidding
people
to
carry
banners
demanding
what
they
consider
their
political
rights
such
a
law
would
of
course
prohibit
political
parades
of
all
kinds
public
mass
meetings
and
other
demonstrations
of
one
set
of
opinions
against
another
set
such
a
law
has
been
proposed
by
senator
myers
of
montana
the
author
of
the
latest
censorship
and
speech
bill
it
may
be
necessary
to
pass
the
law
if
it
is
also
necessary
that
the
public
voice
be
stilled
and
the
nation
become
dumb
and
subservient
but
until
there
is
such
a
law
people
must
be
protected
while
their
actions
remain
within
the
law
if
their
opinions
differ
from
ours
we
must
refrain
from
smashing
their
faces
if
a
certain
number
of
people
believe
that
they
have
the
right
to
vote
we
may
either
grant
their
claim
or
turn
them
sadly
away
but
we
may
not
roll
them
into
the
gutter
if
they
see
fit
to
tell
us
our
professions
of
democracy
are
empty
we
may
smile
sorrowfully
and
murmur
a
prayer
for
their
ignorance
but
we
may
not
pelt
them
with
rotten
eggs
and
fire
a
shot
through
the
window
of
their
dwelling
if
denied
a
properly
dignified
hearing
they
insist
upon
walking
through
the
streets
with
printed
words
on
a
saucy
banner
we
may
be
amazed
at
their
zeal
and
pitiful
of
their
bad
taste
but
even
for
the
sake
of
keeping
their
accusations
out
of
sight
of
our
foreign
visitors
whom
we
have
trained
to
believe
us
perfect
we
may
not
send
them
to
jail
all
this
suffrage
shouting
in
washington
has
as
its
single
object
the
attainment
of
president
wilson
material
support
for
equal
suffrage
president
wilson
word
would
carry
the
question
into
congress
would
there
be
any
harm
in
letting
congress
vote
on
a
suffrage
resolution
that
would
end
the
disturbance
and
it
would
make
our
shield
of
national
justice
somewhat
brighter
it
looks
like
president
wilson
move
between
these
opposing
currents
of
protest
and
support
the
administration
drifted
helplessly
unwilling
to
pass
the
amendment
it
continued
to
send
women
to
prison
on
the
afternoon
of
september
president
wilson
led
his
first
contingent
of
drafted
soldiers
of
freedom
down
pennsylvania
avenue
in
gala
parade
on
the
first
lap
of
their
journey
to
the
battlefields
of
france
on
the
same
afternoon
a
slender
line
of
soldiers
of
freedom
to
march
in
washington
as
they
attempted
to
take
up
their
posts
two
by
two
in
front
of
the
reviewing
stand
opposite
the
white
house
they
were
gathered
in
and
swept
away
by
the
police
like
common
street
their
golden
banners
scarcely
flung
to
the
breeze
president
how
long
must
women
be
denied
a
voice
in
a
government
which
is
conscripting
their
sons
was
the
offensive
question
on
the
first
banner
carried
by
miss
eleanor
calnan
of
massachusetts
and
miss
edith
ainge
of
new
york
the
avenue
was
roped
off
on
account
of
the
parade
there
was
hardly
any
one
passing
at
the
time
all
traffic
had
been
temporarily
suspended
so
there
was
none
to
obstruct
but
the
administration
policy
must
go
on
a
few
moments
and
miss
lucy
branham
of
maryland
and
pauline
adams
of
virginia
marched
down
the
avenue
their
gay
banners
waving
joyously
in
the
autumn
sun
to
fill
up
the
gap
of
the
two
comrades
who
had
been
arrested
they
too
were
shoved
into
the
police
automobile
their
banners
still
high
and
appealing
silhouetted
against
the
sky
as
they
were
hurried
to
the
police
station
the
third
pair
of
pickets
managed
to
cross
the
avenue
but
were
arrested
immediately
they
reached
the
curb
still
others
advanced
the
crowd
began
to
line
the
ropes
and
to
watch
eagerly
the
line
of
women
indomitably
coming
two
by
two
into
the
face
of
certain
arrest
a
fourth
detachment
was
arrested
in
the
middle
of
the
avenue
on
the
trolley
tracks
but
still
they
came
a
few
days
later
more
women
were
sent
to
the
workhouse
for
carrying
to
the
picket
line
this
question
president
wilson
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
have
seen
a
good
many
singular
things
happen
recently
we
have
been
told
there
is
a
deep
disgrace
resting
upon
the
origin
of
this
nation
the
nation
originated
in
the
sharpest
sort
of
criticism
of
public
policy
we
originated
to
put
it
in
the
vernacular
in
a
kick
and
if
it
be
unpatriotic
to
kick
why
then
the
grown
man
is
unlike
the
child
we
have
forgotten
the
very
principle
of
our
origin
if
we
have
forgotten
how
to
object
how
to
resist
how
to
agitate
how
to
pull
down
and
build
up
even
to
the
extent
of
revolutionary
practices
if
it
be
necessary
to
readjust
matters
i
have
forgotten
my
history
if
that
be
not
true
history
the
administration
had
not
yet
abandoned
hope
of
removing
the
pickets
they
persisted
in
their
policy
of
arrests
and
longer
imprisonments
chapter
prison
episodes
during
all
this
time
the
suffrage
prisoners
were
enduring
the
miserable
and
petty
tyranny
of
the
government
workhouse
at
occoquan
they
were
kept
absolutely
incommunicado
they
were
not
allowed
to
see
even
their
nearest
relatives
should
any
be
within
reach
until
they
had
been
in
the
institution
two
weeks
each
prisoner
was
allowed
to
write
one
outgoing
letter
a
month
which
after
being
read
by
the
warden
could
be
sent
or
withheld
at
his
whim
all
incoming
mail
and
telegrams
were
also
censored
by
the
superintendent
and
practically
all
of
them
denied
the
prisoners
superintendent
whittaker
openly
boasted
of
holding
up
the
suffragists
mail
i
am
boss
down
here
he
said
to
visitors
who
asked
to
see
the
prisoners
or
to
send
in
a
note
i
consider
the
letters
and
telegrams
these
prisoners
get
are
treasonable
they
can
not
have
them
he
referred
to
messages
commending
the
women
for
choosing
prison
to
silence
and
bidding
them
stand
steadfast
to
their
program
of
course
all
this
was
done
in
the
hope
of
intimidating
not
only
the
prisoners
but
also
those
who
came
wanting
to
see
them
it
was
the
intention
of
the
women
to
abide
as
far
as
possible
by
the
routine
of
the
institution
disagreeable
and
unreasonable
as
it
was
they
performed
the
tasks
assigned
to
them
they
ate
the
prison
food
without
protest
they
wore
the
coarse
prison
clothes
but
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
of
detention
they
became
so
weak
from
the
shockingly
bad
food
that
they
began
to
wonder
if
they
could
endure
such
a
system
the
petty
tyrannies
they
could
endure
but
the
inevitable
result
of
a
diet
of
sour
bread
vegetables
rancid
soup
with
worms
in
it
was
serious
finally
the
true
condition
of
affairs
trickled
to
the
outside
world
through
the
devious
routes
of
prison
messengers
senator
hamilton
lewis
of
illinois
democratic
whip
in
the
senate
heard
alarming
reports
of
two
of
his
constituents
miss
lucy
ewing
daughter
of
judge
ewing
niece
of
adlai
stevenson
in
cleveland
administration
niece
of
james
ewing
minister
to
belgium
in
the
same
administration
and
william
upton
watson
of
chicago
he
made
a
hurried
trip
to
the
workhouse
to
see
them
the
fastidious
senator
was
at
the
appearance
of
the
prisoners
shocked
at
the
tale
they
told
shocked
that
ladies
should
be
subjected
to
such
indignities
in
all
my
years
of
criminal
practice
said
the
senator
to
gilson
gardner
who
had
accompanied
him
to
the
workhouse
i
have
never
seen
prisoners
so
badly
treated
either
before
or
after
conviction
he
is
a
gallant
gentleman
who
would
be
expected
to
be
uncomfortable
when
he
actually
saw
ladies
suffer
it
was
more
than
gallantry
in
this
instance
however
for
he
spoke
in
frank
condemnation
of
the
whole
shame
and
outrage
of
the
thing
it
is
possible
that
he
reported
to
other
administration
officials
what
he
had
learned
during
his
visit
to
the
workhouse
for
very
soon
afterwards
it
was
announced
that
an
investigation
of
conditions
in
the
workhouse
would
be
held
that
was
of
course
an
admirable
maneuver
which
the
administration
could
make
is
the
president
not
a
kind
man
he
pardoned
some
women
now
he
investigates
the
conditions
under
which
others
are
imprisoned
even
though
they
are
lawless
women
he
wishes
them
well
treated
it
would
sound
noble
to
thousands
immediately
the
district
commissioners
announced
this
investigation
miss
lucy
burns
acting
on
behalf
of
the
national
woman
party
sent
a
letter
to
commissioner
brownlow
after
summing
up
the
food
situation
miss
burns
wrote
when
our
friends
were
sent
to
prison
they
expected
the
food
would
be
extremely
plain
but
they
also
expected
that
enough
eatable
food
would
be
given
them
to
maintain
them
in
their
ordinary
state
of
health
this
has
not
been
the
case
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
prisoners
miss
lavinia
dock
a
trained
nurse
is
extremely
valuable
on
the
question
of
food
supplied
at
occoquan
miss
dock
is
secretary
of
the
american
federation
of
nurses
she
has
had
a
distinguished
career
in
her
profession
she
assisted
in
the
work
after
the
johnstown
flood
and
during
the
yellow
fever
epidemic
in
florida
during
the
spanish
war
she
organized
the
red
cross
work
with
clara
barton
really
thought
said
miss
dock
when
i
last
saw
her
i
could
eat
everything
but
here
i
have
hard
work
choking
down
enough
food
to
keep
the
life
in
me
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
these
conditions
should
be
instantly
remedied
when
these
and
other
prisoners
were
sentenced
to
prison
they
were
sentenced
to
detention
and
not
to
starvation
or
the
hygienic
conditions
have
been
improved
at
occoquan
since
a
group
of
suffragists
were
imprisoned
there
but
they
are
still
bad
the
water
they
drink
is
kept
in
an
open
pail
from
which
it
is
ladled
into
a
drinking
cup
the
prisoners
frequently
dip
the
drinking
cup
directly
into
the
pail
the
same
piece
of
soap
is
used
for
every
prisoner
as
the
prisoners
in
occoquan
are
sometimes
seriously
afflicted
with
disease
this
practice
is
appallingly
negligent
concerning
the
general
conditions
of
the
person
i
am
enclosing
with
this
letter
affidavit
of
virginia
bovee
an
of
the
workhouse
the
prisoners
for
whom
i
am
counsel
are
aware
that
cruel
practices
go
on
at
occoquan
on
one
occasion
they
heard
superintendent
whittaker
kicking
a
woman
in
the
next
room
they
heard
whittaker
voice
the
sound
of
blows
and
the
cries
i
lay
these
facts
before
you
with
the
knowledge
that
you
will
be
glad
to
have
the
fullest
possible
information
given
you
concerning
the
institution
for
whose
administration
you
as
commissioner
of
the
district
of
columbia
are
responsible
very
respectfully

a
matron
was
discharged
from
the
workhouse
because
she
tried
to
be
kind
to
the
suffrage
prisoners
she
also
gave
them
warnings
to
guide
them
past
the
possible
contamination
of
hideous
diseases
as
soon
as
she
was
discharged
from
the
workhouse
she
went
to
the
headquarters
of
the

party
and
volunteered
to
make
an
affidavit

i
was
discharged
yesterday
as
an
officer
of
occoquan
workhouse
for
eight
months
i
acted
as
night
officer
with
no
complaint
as
to
my
performance
of
my
duties
yesterday
superintendent
whittaker
told
me
i
was
discharged
and
gave
me
two
hours
in
which
to
get
out
i
demanded
the
charges
from
the
matron
herndon
and
i
was
told
that
it
was
owing
to
something
that
senator
lewis
has
said
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
conditions
at
occoquan
i
have
had
charge
of
all
the
suffragist
prisoners
who
have
been
there
i
know
that
their
mail
has
been
withheld
from
them
herndon
the
matron
reads
the
mail
and
often
discussed
it
with
us
at
the
officers
table
she
said
of
a
letter
sent
to
one
of
the
suffragist
pickets
now
in
the
workhouse
they
told
her
to
keep
her
eyes
open
and
notice
everything
she
will
never
get
that
letter
said
herndon
then
she
corrected
herself
and
added
not
until
she
goes
away
ordinarily
the
mail
not
given
the
prisoners
is
destroyed
the
mail
for
the
suffragists
is
saved
for
them
until
they
are
ready
to
go
away
i
have
seen
three
of
the

instead
the

i
was
not
there
when
these

arrived
and
i
do
not

how
their

was
arranged
i
doubt
whether
the

would
have
dared
to
give

when

are
finished
they
throw
the

back
in

the
suffragists
are
permitted
three
showers
a
week
and
have
only
these
pieces

joseph
batt
notary
public
while
the
administration
was
planning
an
investigation
of
the
conditions
in
the
workhouse
which
made
it
difficult
for
women
to
sustain
health
through
a
thirty
day
sentence
it
was
through
its
police
court
sentencing
more
women
to
sixty
day
sentences
under
the
same
conditions
the
administration
was
giving
some
thought
to
its
plan
of
procedure
but
not
enough
to
master
the
simple
fact
that
women
would
not
stop
going
to
prison
until
something
had
been
done
which
promised
passage
of
the
amendment
through
congress
new
forms
of
intimidation
and
hardship
were
offered
by
superintendent
whittaker
frederick
kendall
of
buffalo
new
york
a
frail
and
highly
sensitive
woman
was
put
in
a
punishment
cell
on
bread
and
water
under
a
of
impudence
kendall
says
that
her
impudence
consisted
of
protesting
to
the
matron
that
scrubbing
floors
on
my
hands
and
knees
was
too
severe
work
for
me
as
i
had
been
unable
for
days
to
eat
the
prison
food
my
impudence
further
consisted
in
asking
for
lighter
work
kendall
was
refused
the
clean
clothing
she
should
have
had
the
day
she
was
put
in
solitary
confinement
and
was
thus
forced
to
wear
the
same
clothing
eleven
days
she
was
refused
a
nightdress
or
clean
linen
for
the
cot
her
only
toilet
accommodations
was
an
open
pail
for
four
days
she
was
allowed
no
water
for
toilet
her
diet
consisted
of
three
thin
slices
of
bread
and
three
cups
of
water
carried
to
her
in
a
paper
cup
which
frequently
leaked
out
half
the
meager
supply
before
it
got
to
kendall
cell
representative
and
charles
bennet
smith
of
buffalo
friends
of
kendall
created
a
considerable
disturbance
when
they
learned

fell

was
such
shocking
facts
as
these
that
the
commissioners
and
their
investigating
board
were
vainly
trying
to
keep
from
the
country
for
the
sake
of
the
reputation
of

attempting

the

moved
by
these

similar

to
introduce

this
appeal
to

was
rather
pathetic

i

i
want
to
get
out

heavy
even
this
poor

we
do
not

i
do

you
must
eat
and
if
you
do
like
it
here
you
go
and
tell
the
judge
you
wo
picket
any
more
and
then
you
can
get
out
of
here
but
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
go
against
my
principles
and
my
belief
he
asked
do
you
believe
you
should
break
the
law
i
replied
i
have
picketed
whenever
i
had
a
chance
for
eight
years

have
never
broken
the

picketing
is
legal

wiley
wrote
november
dear
kober
i
am
personally
acquainted
with
many
of
the
women
who
have
been
confined
at
occoquan
and
at
the
district
jail
and
have
heard
from
their
own
lips
an
account
of
the
nutrition
and
sanitary
conditions
prevailing
at
both
places
i
therefore
feel
constrained
to
make
known
to
you
the
conditions
as
they
have
been
told
to
me
and
as
i
believe
them
actually
to
exist
as
i
understand
it
there
is
no
purpose
in
penal
servitude
of
lowering
the
vitality
of
the
prisoner
or
in
inviting
disease
yet
both
of
these
conditions
prevail
both
at
occoquan
and
at
the
district
jail
first
of
all
the
food
question
the
diet
furnished
the
prisoners
at
occoquan
especially
is
of
a
character
to
all
kinds
of
infections
that
may
prevail
and
to
lower
the
vitality
so
that
the
resistance
to
disease
is
diminished
i
have
fortunately
come
into
possession
of
samples
of
the
food
actually
given
to
these
women
i
have
kept
samples
of
the
milk
religiously
for
over
two
weeks
to
see
if
i
could
detect
the
least
particle
of
fat
and
have
been
unable
to
perceive
any
the
fat
of
milk
is
universally
recognized
by
dieticians
as
its
most
important
nutritive
character
i
understand
that
a
dairy
is
kept
on
the
farm
at
occoquan
and
yet
it
is
perfectly
certain
that
no
whole
milk
is
served
or
ever
has
been
served
to
one
of
the
picketers
in
that
jail
i
have
not
had
enough
of
the
sample
to
make
a
chemical
analysis
but
being
somewhat
experienced
in
milk
i
can
truthfully
say
that
it
seems
to
me
to
be
watered
skimmed
milk
i
also
have
a
sample
of
the
pea
soup
served
the
pea
grains
are
coarsely
broken
often
more
than
half
of
a
pea
being
served
in
one
piece
they
never
have
been
cooked
but
are
in
a
perfectly
raw
state
and
found
to
be
inedible
by
the
prisoners
i
have
also
samples
of
the
corn
bread
which
is
most
unattractive
and
repellant
to
the
eye
and
to
the
taste
all
of
these
witnesses
say
that
the
white
bread
apparently
is
of
good
quality
but
the
diet
in
every
case
is
the
cause
of
constipation
except
in
the
case
of
pea
soup
which
brings
on
diarrhea
and
vomiting
as
nutrition
is
the
very
foundation
of
sanitation
i
wish
to
call
to
your
special
attention
as
a
sanitation
the
totally
inadequate
sustenance
given
to
these
prisoners
the
food
at
the
county
jail
at
washington
is
much
better
than
the
food
at
occoquan
but
still
bad
enough
this
increased
excellence
of
food
is
set
off
by
the
miserable
ventilation
of
the
cells
in
which
these
noble
women
are
kept
in
solitary
confinement
not
only
have
they
had
a
struggle
to
get
the
windows
open
slightly
but
also
at
the
time
of
their
morning
meal
the
sweeping
is
done
the
air
of
the
cells
is
filled
with
dust
and
they
try
to
cover
their
coffee
and
other
food
with
such
articles
as
they
can
find
to
keep
the
dust
out
of
their
food
better
conditions
for
promoting
tuberculosis
could
not
be
found
i
appeal
to
you
as
a
sanitarian
to
get
the
board
of
charities
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
as
would
secure
to
prisoners
of
all
kinds
and
especially
to
political
prisoners
as
humane
an
environment
as
possible
i
also
desire
to
ask
that
the
board
of
charities
would
authorize
me
to
make
inspections
of
food
furnished
to
prisoners
at
occoquan
and
at
the
district
jail
and
to
have
physical
and
chemical
analysis
made
without
expense
to
the
board
in
order
to
determine
more
fully
the
nutritive
environment
in
which
the
prisoners
live

humor
predominated
in
the
poems
that
came
out
of
prison
there
was
never
any
word
of
tragedy
not
even
an
intolerable
diet
of
raw
salt
pork
which
by
actual
count
of
miss
margaret
potheringham
a
teacher
of
domestic
science
and
dietetics
was
served
the
suffragists
sixteen
times
in
eighteen
days
could
break
their
spirit
of
gayety
and
when
a
piece
of
fish
of
unknown
origin
was
slipped
through
the
tiny
opening
in
the
cell
door
and
a
specimen
carefully
preserved
for
by
the
way
was
unable
to
classify

more
diverted
than
outraged

it
was
a
prayer
which
enlivened
the
evening
hour
before
bedtime
mary
winsor
of
haverford
pennsylvania
was
the
master
one
night
it
was
a
baptist
prayer
another
a
methodist
and
still
another
a
stern
presbyterian
prayer
the
prayers
were
most
disconcerting
to
the
matron
for
the
regulars
became
almost
hysterical
with
laughter
when
they
should
be
slipping
into
sleep
it
was
trying
also
to
sit
in
the
corridor
and
hear
your
daily
cruelties
narrated
to
god
and
punishment
asked
this
is
what
happened
to
the
embarrassed
warden
and
jail
attendants
if
they
came
to
protest
sometimes
it
was
the
beautiful
voice
of
vida
milholland
which
rang
through
the
corridors
of
the
dreary
prison
with
a
stirring
irish
ballad
a
french
love
song
or
the
woman
marseillaise
again
the
prisoners
would
build
a
song
each
calling
out
from
cell
to
cell
and
contributing
a
line
the
following
song
to
the
tune

defying

triumphant

the
gayety
was
interspersed
with
sadness
when
the
suffragists
learned
of
new
cruelties
heaped
upon
the
helpless
ones
those
who
were
without
influence
or
friends
they
learned
of
that
barbarous
punishment
known
as
the
greasy
pole
used
upon
girl
prisoners
this
method
of
punishment
consisted
of
strapping
girls
with
their
hands
tied
behind
them
to
a
greasy
pole
from
which
they
were
partly
suspended
unable
to
keep
themselves
in
an
upright
position
because
of
the
grease
on
the
pole
they
slipped
almost
to
the
floor
with
their
arms
all
but
severed
from
the
arm
sockets
suffering
intense
pain
for
long
periods
of
time
this
cruel
punishment
was
meted
out
to
prisoners
for
slight
infractions
of
the
prison
rules
the
suffrage
prisoners
learned
also
of
the
race
hatred
which
the
authorities
encouraged
it
was
not
infrequent
that
the
jail
officers
summoned
black
girls
to
attack
white
women
if
the
latter
disobeyed
this
happened
in
one
instance
to
the
suffrage
prisoners
who
were
protesting
against
the
warden
forcibly
taking
a
suffragist
from
the
workhouse
without
telling
her
or
her
comrades
whither
she
was
being
taken
black
girls
were
called
and
commanded
to
physically
attack
the
suffragists
the
negresses
reluctant
to
do
so
were
goaded
to
deliver
blows
upon
the
women
by
the
warden
threats
of
punishment
and
as
a
result
of
our
having
been
in
prison
our
headquarters
has
never
ceased
being
the
mecca
of
many
discouraged
inmates
when
released
they
come
for
money
they
come
for
work
they
come
for
spiritual
encouragement
to
face
life
after
the
wrecking
experience
of
imprisonment
some
regard
us
as
fellow
prisoners
others
regard
us
as
friends
at
court
occasionally
we
meet
a
prison
associate
in
the
workaday
world
long
after
lawrence
lewis
imprisonment
when
she
was
working
on
ratification
of
the
amendment
in
delaware
she
was
greeted
warmly
by
a
charming
young
woman
who
came
forward
at
a
meeting
do
you
remember
me
she
asked
as
lewis
struggled
to
recollect
do
you
remember
me
i
met
you
in
washington
i
sorry
but
i
seem
to
have
forgotten
where
i
met
you
said
lewis
apologetically
in
jail
came
the
answer
hesitantly
whereupon
lewis
listened
sympathetically
while
her
fellow
prisoner
told
her
that
she
had
been
in
jail
at
the
tipie
lewis
was
that
her
crime
was
bigamy
and
that
she
was
one
of
the
traveling
circus
troupe
then
in
dover
she
brought
up
her
husband
also
a
member
of
the
circus
said
lewis
in
telling
of
the
incident
and
they
both
joined
enthusiastically
in
a
warm
invitation
to
come
and
see
them
in
the
circus
as
each
group
of
suffragists
was
released
an
enthusiastic
welcome
was
given
to
them
at
headquarters
and
at
these
times
in
the
midst
of
the
warmth
of
approving
and
appreciative
comrades
some
of
the
most
beautiful
speeches
were
delivered
i
quote
a
part
of
katharine
fisher
speech
at
a
dinner
in
honor
of
released
prisoners
five
of
us
who
are
with
you
have
recently
come
out
from
the
workhouse
into
the
world
a
great
change
not
so
much
of
a
change
for
women
disfranchised
women
in
prison
or
out
american
women
are
not
free
our
lot
of
physical
freedom
simply
gives
us
and
the
public
a
new
and
vivid
sense
of
what
our
lack
of
political
freedom
really
means
disfranchisement
is
the
prison
of
women
power
and
spirit
women
have
long
been
classed
with
criminals
so
far
as
their
voting
rights
are
concerned
and
how
quick
the
government
is
to
live
up
to
its
classification
the
minute
women
determinedly
insist
upon
these
rights
prison
life
epitomizes
all
life
under
undemocratic
rule
at
occoquan
as
at
the
capitol
and
the
white
house
we
faced
hypocrisy
trickery
and
treachery
on
the
part
of
those
in
power
and
the
constant
appeal
to
us
to
cooperate
with
the
workhouse
authorities
sounded
wonderfully
like
the
exhortation
addressed
to
all
women
to
support
the
government
is
that
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
i
asked
superintendent
whittaker
concerning
a
statement
he
had
made
to
me
it
is
the
law
he
answered
because
it
is
the
rule
i
make
the
answer
of
whittaker
is
the
answer
wilson
makes
to
women
every
time
the
government
of
which
he
is
the
head
enacts
a
law
and
at
the
same
time
continues
to
refuse
to
pass
the
susan
anthony
amendment
we
seem
to
stand
before
you
free
but
i
have
no
sense
of
freedom
because
i
have
left
comrades
at
occoquan
and
because
other
comrades
may
at
any
moment
join
them
there
while
comrades
are
there
what
is
our
freedom
it
is
as
empty
as
the
political
freedom
of
women
who
have
won
suffrage
by
a
state
referendum
like
them
we
are
free
only
within
limits
we
must
not
let
our
voice
be
drowned
by
war
trumpets
or
cannon
if
we
do
we
shall
find
ourselves
when
the
war
is
over
with
a
peace
that
will
only
prolong
our
struggle
a
democracy
that
will
belie
its
name
by
leaving
out
half
the
people
the
administration
continued
to
send
women
to
the
workhouse
and
the
district
jail
for
thirty
and
sixty
day

dudley
field
malone
was
known
to
the
country
as
sharing
the
intimate
confidence
and
friendship
of
president
wilson
he
had
known
and
supported
the
president
from
the
beginning
of
the
president
political
career
he
had
campaigned
twice
through
new
jersey
with
wilson
as
governor
he
had
managed
campaigns
in
many
states
for
the
nomination
before
the
baltimore
convention
he
had
toured
the
country
with
wilson
in
and
it
was
he
who
led
to
victory
president
wilson
fight
for
california
in
so
when
malone
went
to
the
white
house
in
july
to
protest
against
the
administration
handling
of
the
suffrage
question
he
went
not
only
as
a
confirmed
suffragist
but
also
a
confirmed
supporter
and
member
of
the
wilson
one
who
had
been
chosen
to
go
to
the
west
in
to
win
women
voters
to
the
democratic
party
malone
has
consented
to
tell
for
the
first
time
in
this
record
of
the
militant
campaign
what
happened
at
his
memorable
interview
with
president
wilson
in
july
an
interview
which
he
followed
up
two
months
later
with
his
resignation
as
collector
of
the
port
of
new
york
i
quote
the
story
in
his
own
words
frank
walsh
amos
pinchot
frederic
howe
j
hopkins
allen
mccurdy
and
i
were
present
throughout
the
trial
of
the
sixteen
women
in
july
immediately
after
the
police
court
judge
had
pronounced
his
sentence
of
sixty
days
in
the
occoquan
workhouse
upon
these
first
offenders
on
the
alleged
charge
of
a
traffic
violation
i
went
over
to
anne
martin
one
of
the
women
counsel
and
offered
to
act
as
attorney
on
the
appeal
of
the
case
i
then
went
to
the
court
clerk
office
and
telephoned
to
president
wilson
at
the
whit
house
asking
him
to
see
me
at
once
it
was
three
i
called
a
taxicab
drove
direct
to
the
executive
offices
and
met
him
i
began
by
reminding
the
president
that
in
the
seven
years
and
a
half
of
our
personal
and
political
association
we
had
never
had
a
serious
difference
he
was
good
enough
to
say
that
my
loyalty
to
him
bad
been
one
of
the
happiest
circumstances
of
his
public
career
but
i
told
him
i
had
come
to
place
my
resignation
in
his
hands
as
i
could
not
remain
a
member
of
any
administration
which
dared
to
send
american
women
to
prison
for
demanding
national
suffrage
i
also
informed
him
that
i
had
offered
to
act
as
counsel
for
the
suffragists
on
the
appeal
of
their
case
he
asked
me
for
full
details
of
my
complaint
and
attitude
i
told
wilson
everything
i
had
witnessed
from
the
time
we
saw
the
suffragists
arrested
in
front
of
the
white
house
to
their
sentence
in
the
police
court
i
observed
that
although
we
might
not
agree
with
the
manners
of
picketing
citizens
had
a
right
to
petition
the
president
or
any
other
official
of
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
he
seemed
to
acquiesce
in
this
view
and
reminded
me
that
the
women
had
been
unmolested
at
the
white
house
gates
for
over
five
months
adding
that
he
had
even
ordered
the
head
usher
to
invite
the
women
on
cold
days
to
come
into
the
white
house
and
warm
themselves
and
have
coffee
if
the
situation
is
as
you
describe
it
it
is
shocking
said
the
president
the
manhandling
of
the
women
by
the
police
was
outrageous
and
the
entire
trial
before
a
judge
of
your
own
appointment
was
a
perversion
of
justice
i
said
this
seemed
to
annoy
the
president
and
he
replied
with
asperity
why
do
you
come
to
me
in
this
indignant
fashion
for
things
which
have
been
done
by
the
police
officials
of
the
city
of
washington
president
i
said
the
treatment
of
these
women
is
the
result
of
carefully
laid
plans
made
by
the
district
missioners
of
the
city
of
washington
who
were
appointed
to
office
by
you
newspaper
men
of
unquestioned
information
and
integrity
have
told
me
that
the
district
commissioners
have
been
in
consultation
with
your
private
secretary
tumulty
and
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
mcadoo
sat
in
at
a
conference
when
the
policy
of
these
arrests
was
being
determined
the
president
asserted
his
ignorance
of
all
this
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
said
that
you
intend
to
resign
to
repudiate
me
and
my
administration
and
sacrifice
me
for
your
views
on
this
suffrage
question
his
attitude
then
angered
me
and
i
said
president
if
there
is
any
sacrifice
in
this
unhappy
circumstance
it
is
i
who
am
making
the
sacrifice
i
was
sent
twice
as
your
spokesman
in
the
last
campaign
to
the
woman
suffrage
states
of
the
west
you
have
since
been
good
enough
to
say
publicly
and
privately
that
i
did
as
much
as
any
man
to
carry
california
for
you
after
my
first
tour
i
had
a
long
conference
with
you
here
at
the
white
house
on
the
political
situation
in
those
states
i
told
you
that
i
found
your
strength
with
women
voters
lay
in
the
fact
that
you
had
with
great
patience
and
statesmanship
kept
this
country
out
of
the
european
war
but
that
your
great
weakness
with
women
voters
was
that
you
had
not
taken
any
step
throughout
your
entire
administration
to
urge
the
passage
of
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
which
hughes
was
advocating
and
which
alone
can
enfranchise
all
the
women
of
the
nation
you
asked
me
then
how
i
met
this
situation
and
i
told
you
that
i
promised
the
women
voters
of
the
west
that
if
they
showed
the
political
sagacity
to
choose
you
as
against
hughes
i
would
do
everything
in
my
power
to
get
your
administration
to
take
up
and
pass
the
suffrage
amendment
you
were
pleased
and
approved
of
what
i
had
done
i
returned
to
california
and
repeated
this
promise
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
must
keep
my
part
of
that
obligation
i
reiterated
to
the
president
my
earlier
appeal
that
he
assist
suffrage
as
an
urgent
war
measure
and
a
necessary
part
of
america
program
for
world
democracy
to
which
the
president
replied
the
enfranchisement
of
women
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
a
program
of
democracy
and
i
see
nothing
in
the
argument
that
it
is
a
war
measure
unless
you
mean
that
american
women
will
not
loyally
support
the
war
unless
they
are
given
the
vote
i
firmly
denied
this
conclusion
of
the
president
and
told
him
that
while
american
women
with
or
without
the
vote
would
support
the
united
states
government
against
german
militarism
yet
it
seemed
to
me
a
great
opportunity
of
his
leadership
to
remove
this
grievance
which
women
generally
felt
against
him
and
his
administration
president
i
urged
if
you
as
the
leader
will
persuade
the
administration
to
pass
the
federal
amendment
you
will
release
from
the
suffrage
fight
the
energies
of
thousands
of
women
which
will
be
given
with
redoubled
zeal
to
the
support
of
your
program
for
international
justice
but
the
president
absolutely
refused
to
admit
the
validity
of
my
appeal
though
it
was
as
a
war
measure
that
the
president
some
months
later
demanded
that
the
senate
pass
the
suffrage
amendment
the
president
was
visibly
moved
as
i
added
you
are
the
president
now
reelected
to
office
you
ask
if
i
am
going
to
sacrifice
you
you
sacrifice
nothing
by
my
resignation
but
i
lose
much
i
quit
a
political
career
i
give
up
a
powerful
office
in
my
own
state
i
who
have
no
money
sacrifice
a
lucrative
salary
and
go
back
to
revive
my
law
practice
but
most
of
all
i
sever
a
personal
association
with
you
of
the
deepest
affection
which
you
know
has
meant
much
to
me
these
past
seven
years
but
i
can
not
and
will
not
remain
in
office
and
see
women
thrown
into
jail
because
they
demand
their
political
freedom
the
president
earnestly
urged
me
not
to
resign
saying
what
will
the
people
of
the
country
think
when
they
hear
that
the
collector
of
the
port
of
new
york
has
resigned
because
of
an
injustice
done
to
a
group
of
suffragists
by
the
police
officials
of
the
city
of
washington
my
reply
to
this
was
with
all
respect
for
you
president
my
explanation
to
the
public
will
not
be
as
difficult
as
yours
if
i
am
compelled
to
remind
the
public
that
you
have
appointed
to
office
and
can
remove
all
the
important
officials
of
the
city
of
washington
the
president
ignored
this
and
insisted
that
i
should
not
resign
saying
i
do
not
question
your
intense
conviction
about
this
matter
as
i
know
you
have
always
been
an
ardent
fragist
and
since
you
feel
as
you
do
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
become
their
counsel
and
take
this
case
up
on
appeal
without
resigning
from
the
administration
but
i
said
president
that
arrangement
would
be
impossible
for
two
reasons
first
these
women
would
not
want
me
as
their
counsel
if
i
were
a
member
of
your
administration
for
it
would
appear
to
the
public
then
as
if
your
administration
was
not
responsible
for
the
indignities
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
and
your
administration
is
responsible
and
secondly
i
can
not
accept
your
suggestion
because
it
may
be
necessary
in
the
course
of
the
appeal
vigorously
to
criticize
and
condemn
members
of
your
cabinet
and
others
close
to
you
and
i
could
not
adopt
this
policy
while
remaining
in
office
under
you
the
president
seemed
greatly
upset
and
finally
urged
me
as
a
personal
service
to
him
to
go
at
once
and
perfect
the
case
on
appeal
for
the
suffragists
but
not
to
resign
until
i
had
thought
it
over
for
a
day
and
until
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
investigate
the
facts
i
had
presented
to
him
i
agreed
to
this
and
we
closed
the
interview
with
the
president
saying
if
you
consider
my
personal
request
and
do
not
resign
please
do
not
leave
washington
without
coming
to
see
me
i
left
the
executive
offices
and
never
saw
him
again
there
was
just
a
day
and
a
half
left
to
perfect
the
exceptions
for
the
appeal
under
the
rules
of
procedure
no
stenographic
record
of
the
trial
had
been
taken
which
put
me
under
the
greatest
legal
difficulties
i
was
in
the
midst
of
these
preparations
for
appeal
the
next
day
when
i
learned
to
my
surprise
that
the
president
had
pardoned
the
women
he
had
not
even
consulted
me
as
their
attorney
moreover
i
was
amazed
that
since
the
president
had
said
he
considered
the
treatment
of
the
women
shocking
he
had
pardoned
them
without
stating
that
he
did
so
to
correct
a
grave
injustice
i
felt
certain
that
the
women
in
the
workhouse
would
refuse
to
accept
the
pardon
as
a
mere
benevolent
act
on
the
part
of
the
president
i
at
once
went
down
to
the
workhouse
in
virginia
my
opinion
was
confirmed
the
group
refused
to
accept
the
president
pardon
i
advised
them
that
as
a
matter
of
law
no
one
could
compel
them
to
accept
the
pardon
but
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
would
have
to
accept
it
for
the
attorney
general
would
have
them
all
put
out
of
the
institution
bag
and
baggage
so
as
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
president
had
said
to
me
that
their
treatment
was
shocking
i
made
public
the
following
statement
the
president
pardon
is
an
acknowledgment
by
him
of
the
grave
injustice
that
has
been
done
this
he
never
denied
under
this
published
interpretation
of
his
pardon
the
women
at
occoquan
accepted
the
pardon
and
returned
to
washington
the
incident
was
closed
i
returned
to
new
york
during
the
next
two
months
i
carefully
watched
the
situation
six
or
eight
more
groups
of
women
in
that
time
were
arrested
on
the
same
false
charges
tried
and
imprisoned
in
the
same
illegal
way
finally
a
group
of
women
was
arrested
in
september
under
the
identical
circumstances
as
those
in
july
was
tried
in
the
same
lawless
fashion
and
given
the
same
sentence
of
sixty
days
in
the
workhouse
the
president
may
have
been
innocent
of
responsibility
for
the
first
arrests
but
he
was
personally
and
politically
responsible
for
all
the
arrests
that
occurred
after
his
pardon
of
the
first
group
under
this
development
it
seemed
to
me
that
demanded
action
so
i
sent
my
resignation
to
the
president
publicly
stated
my
attitude
and
regretfully
left
his
administration
malone
resignation
in
september
came
with
a
sudden
shock
because
the
entire
country
and
surely
the
administration
thought
him
quieted
and
subdued
by
the
president
personal
appeal
to
him
in
july
malone
was
shocked
that
the
policy
of
arrests
should
be
continued
wilson
and
his
administration
were
shocked
that
any
one
should
care
enough
about
the
liberty
of
women
to
resign
a
lucrative
post
in
the
government
the
nation
was
shocked
into
the
realization
that
this
was
not
a
street
brawl
between
women
and
policemen
but
a
controversy
between
suffragists
and
a
powerful
administration
we
had
said
so
but
it
would
have
taken
months
to
convince
the
public
that
the
president
was
in
any
way
responsible
malone
did
what
we
could
only
have
done
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
after
more
longed
sacrifices
he
laid
the
responsibility
squarely
and
dramatically
where
it
belonged
it
is
impossible
to
overemphasize
what
a
tremendous
acceleration
malone
fine
solitary
and
generous
act
gave
to
the
speedy
of
the
administration
resistance
his
sacrifice
lightened
ours
women
ought
to
be
willing
to
make
sacrifices
for
their
own
liberation
but
for
a
man
to
have
the
courage
and
imagination
to
make
such
a
sacrifice
for
the
liberation
of
women
is
unparalleled
malone
called
to
the
attention
of
the
nation
the
true
cause
of
the
obstruction
and
suppression
he
reproached
the
president
and
his
colleagues
after
mature
consideration
in
the
most
honorable
and
vital
way
refusing
longer
to
associate
himself
with
an
administration
which
backed
such
policies
and
malone
resignation
was
not
only
welcomed
by
the
militant
group
the
conservative
suffrage
leaders
although
they
heartily
disapproved
of
picketing
were
as
outspoken
in
their
gratitude

may
i
express
my
appreciation
and
gratitude
for
the
excellent
and
manly
letter
that
you
have
written
to
president
wilson
on
woman
suffrage
i
am
sure
that
i
am
only
one
of
many
women
who
feel
thankful
to
you
for
it
the
picketing
seems
to
me
a
very
silly
business
and
i
am
sure
it
is
doing
the
cause
harm
instead
of
good
but
the
picketers
are
being
shamefully
and
illegally
treated
and
it
is
a
thousand
pities
for
president
wilson
own
sake
that
he
ever
allowed
the
washington
authorities
to
enter
on
this
course
of
persecution
it
was
high
time
for
some
one
to
make
a
protest
and
you
have
made
one

came
out
it
was
the
noblest
act
that
any

ever
did
on

the

was

you

no
words
of
mine
can
tell
you
how
our
hearts
have
been
lifted
and
our
purposes
strengthened
in
this
tremendous
struggle
in
new
york
state
by
the
reading
of
your
powerful
and
noble
utterances
in
your
letter
to
president
wilson
there
flashed
through
my
mind
all
the
memories
of
knights
of
chivalry
and
of
romance
that
i
have
ever
read
and
they
all
paled
before
your
championship
and
the
sacrifice
and
the
leadership
that
it
signifies
where
you
lead
i
believe
thousands
of
other
men
will
follow
even
though
at
a
distance
and
most
inadequately
and
from
the
women
voters
of
california
with
whom
malone
had
kept
faith
came
the
message
the
women
of
california
greet
you
as
one
of
the
few
men
in
history
who
have
been
willing
to
sacrifice
material
interests
for
the
liberty
of
a
class
to
which
they
themselves
do
not
belong
we
are
thrilled
by
your
inspiring
words
we
appreciate
your
understanding
of
the
viewpoint
of
disfranchised
women
we
are
deeply
grateful
for
the
incalculable
benefit
of
your
active
assistance
in
the
struggle
of
american
women
for
political
liberty
and
for
a
real
democracy
i
reprint
malone
letter
of
resignation
which
sets
forth
in
detail
his
position
september
the
president
the
white
house
washington
dear
president
last
autumn
as
the
representative
of
your
administration
i
went
into
the
woman
suffrage
states
to
urge
your
reelection
the
most
difficult
argument
to
meet
among
the
seven
million
voters
was
the
failure
of
the
democratic
party
throughout
four
years
of
power
to
pass
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
looking
toward
the
enfranchisement
of
all
the
women
of
the
country
throughout
those
states
and
particularly
in
california
which
ultimately
decided
the
election
by
the
votes
of
women
the
women
voters
were
urged
to
support
you
even
though
judge
hughes
had
already
declared
for
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
because
you
and
your
party
through
liberal
leadership
were
more
likely
nationally
to
enfranchise
the
rest
of
the
women
of
the
country
than
were
your
opponents
and
if
the
women
of
the
west
voted
to
reelect
you
i
promised
them
that
i
would
spend
all
my
energy
at
any
sacrifice
to
myself
to
get
the
present
democratic
administration
to
pass
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
but
the
present
policy
of
the
administration
in
permitting
splendid
american
women
to
be
sent
to
jail
in
washington
not
for
carrying
offensive
banners
not
for
picketing
but
on
the
technical
charge
of
obstructing
traffic
is
a
denial
even
of
their
constitutional
right
to
petition
for
and
demand
the
passage
of
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
it
therefore
now
becomes
my
profound
obligation
actively
to
keep
my
promise
to
the
women
of
the
west
in
more
than
twenty
states
it
is
a
practical
impossibility
to
amend
the
state
constitutions
so
the
women
of
those
states
can
only
be
enfranchised
by
the
passage
of
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
since
england
and
russia
in
the
midst
of
the
great
war
have
assured
the
national
enfranchisement
of
their
women
should
we
not
be
jealous
to
maintain
our
democratic
leadership
in
the
world
by
the
speedy
national
enfranchisement
of
american
women
to
me
president
as
i
urged
upon
you
in
washington
two
months
ago
this
is
not
only
a
measure
of
justice
and
democracy
it
is
also
an
urgent
war
measure
the
women
of
the
nation
are
and
always
will
be
loyal
to
the
country
and
the
passage
of
the
suffrage
amendment
is
only
the
first
step
toward
their
national
emancipation
but
unless
the
government
takes
at
least
this
first
step
toward
their
enfranchisement
how
can
the
government
ask
millions
of
american
women
educated
in
our
schools
and
colleges
and
millions
of
american
women
in
our
homes
or
toiling
for
economic
independence
in
every
line
of
industry
to
give
up
by
conscription
their
men
and
happiness
to
a
war
for
democracy
in
europe
while
these
women
citizens
are
denied
the
right
to
vote
on
the
policies
of
the
government
which
demands
of
them
such
sacrifice
for
this
reason
many
of
your
most
ardent
friends
and
supporters
feel
that
the
passage
of
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
is
a
war
measure
which
could
appropriately
be
urged
by
you
at
this
session
of
congress
it
is
true
that
this
amendment
would
have
to
come
from
congress
but
the
present
congress
shows
no
earnest
desire
to
enact
this
legislation
for
the
simple
reason
that
you
as
the
leader
of
the
party
in
power
have
not
yet
suggested
it
for
the
whole
country
gladly
acknowledges
president
that
no
vital
piece
of
legislation
has
come
through
congress
these
five
years
except
by
your
extraordinary
and
brilliant
leadership
and
what
millions
of
men
and
women
hope
is
that
you
will
give
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
to
the
women
of
the
country
by
the
valor
of
your
leadership
now
it
will
hearten
the
mothers
of
the
nation
eliminate
a
just
grievance
and
turn
the
devoted
energies
of
brilliant
women
to
a
more
hearty
support
of
the
government
in
this
crisis
as
you
well
know
in
dozens
of
speeches
in
many
states
i
have
advocated
your
policies
and
the
war
i
was
the
first
man
of
your
administration
nearly
five
years
ago
to
publicly
advocate
preparedness
and
helped
to
found
the
first
plattsburg
training
camp
and
if
with
our
troops
mobilizing
in
france
you
will
give
american
women
this
measure
for
their
political
freedom
they
will
support
with
greater
enthusiasm
your
hope
and
the
hope
of
america
for
world
freedom
i
have
not
approved
all
the
methods
recently
adopted
by
women
in
pursuit
of
their
political
liberty
yet
president
the
committee
on
suffrage
of
the
united
states
senate
was
formed
in
when
i
was
one
year
old
this
same
federal
suffrage
amendment
was
first
introduced
in
congress
in
brave
women
like
susan
anthony
were
petitioning
congress
for
the
suffrage
before
the
civil
war
and
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war
men
like
william
lloyd
garrison
horace
greeley
and
wendell
phillips
assured
the
suffrage
leaders
that
if
they
abandoned
their
fight
for
suffrage
when
the
war
was
ended
the
men
of
the
nation
out
of
gratitude
would
enfranchise
the
women
of
country
and
if
the
men
of
this
country
had
been
peacefully
demanding
for
over
half
a
century
the
political
right
or
privilege
to
vote
and
had
been
continuously
ignored
or
met
with
evasion
by
successive
congresses
as
have
the
women
you
president
as
a
lover
of
liberty
would
be
the
first
to
comprehend
and
forgive
their
inevitable
impatience
and
righteous
indignation
will
not
this
administration
reelected
to
power
by
the
hope
and
faith
of
the
women
of
the
west
handsomely
reward
that
faith
by
taking
action
now
for
the
passage
of
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
in
the
port
of
new
york
during
the
last
four
years
billions
of
dollars
in
the
export
and
import
trade
of
the
country
have
been
handled
by
the
men
of
the
customs
service
their
treatment
of
the
traveling
public
has
radically
changed
their
vigilance
supplied
the
evidence
of
the
lusitania
note
the
neutrality
was
rigidly
maintained
the
great
german
fleet
guarded
captured
and
economies
and
reforms
have
been
concluded
and
my
ardent
industry
has
been
given
to
this
great
office
of
your
appointment
but
now
i
wish
to
leave
these
finished
tasks
to
return
to
my
profession
of
the
law
and
to
give
all
my
leisure
time
to
fight
as
hard
for
the
political
freedom
of
women
as
i
have
always
fought
for
your
liberal
leadership
it
seems
a
long
seven
years
president
since
i
first
campaigned
with
you
when
you
were
running
for
governor
of
new
jersey
in
every
circumstance
throughout
those
years
i
have
served
you
with
the
most
respectful
affection
and
unshadowed
devotion
it
is
no
small
sacrifice
now
for
me
as
a
member
of
your
administration
to
sever
our
political
relationship
but
i
think
it
is
high
time
that
men
in
this
generation
at
some
cost
to
themselves
stood
up
to
battle
for
the
national
enfranchisement
of
american
women
so
in
order
effectively
to
keep
my
promise
made
in
the
west
and
more
freely
to
go
into
this
larger
field
of
democratic
effort
i
hereby
resign
my
office
as

i
have
i
am
sorry
to

been

i
must
frankly
say
that
i
can
not
regard
your
reasons
for
resigning
your
position
as
collector
of
customs
as
convincing
but
it
is
so
evidently
your
wish
to
be
relieved
from
the
duties
of
the
office
that
i
do
not
feel
at
liberty
to
withhold
my
acceptance
of
your
resignation
indeed
i
judge
from
your
letter
that
any
discussion
of
the
reasons
would
not
be
acceptable
to
you
and
that
it
is
your
desire
to
be
free
of
the
restraints
of
public
office
i
therefore
accept
your
resignation
to
take

as
you
have
wished

need
not

dear

after
a

careful
of

i
am

understand
how
you
could
judge
that
any
discussion
by
you
of
my
reasons
for
resigning
would
not
be
acceptable
to

since
my

was
an
appeal
to
you
on
specific

for
action

it
may
have

it
is

that

public
statement
of
byron
newton
appointed
by
the

to
succeed

by

yields
immediately
after
malone
sensational
resignation
the

sought
another
way
to
remove
the
persistent
pickets
without
passing
the
amendment
it
yielded
on
a
point
of
machinery
it
gave
us
a
report
in
the
senate
and
a
committee
in
the
house
and
expected
us
to
be
grateful
the
press
had
turned
again
to
more
sympathetic
accounts
of
our
campaign
and
exposed
the
prison
regime
we
were
undergoing
we
were
now
for
a
moment
the
object
of
sympathy
the
administration
was
the
butt
of
considerable
hostility
sensing
their
predicament
and
fearing
any
loss
of
prestige
they
risked
a
slight
advance
senator
jones

to

scarcely
had

recovered
from
the
surprise
of
his

on

filed
the
favorable

which
had
been
lying
with

exactly
six

the

had
so
long

a
particularly
brilliant
and
elaborate
one

to
which
was
referred
the
joint

proposing

conferring
upon

the

that

followed
by
a
vote
of
to
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
favor
of
creating
a
committee
on

in
the

this
vote
was
indicative
of
the
strength

was
sponsored
by

it
is
an
interesting
study
in

to
consider
some
of
the
statements
made
in
the
peculiarly
heated
debate
the
day
this
vote
was
taken
scores
of
congressmen
anxious
to
refute
the
idea
that
the
indomitable
picket
had
had
anything
to
do
with
their
action
revealed
naively
how
surely
it

of
the

not

stood
squarely
up
for
the
right
of
the
hundreds
of
women
who
petitioned
for
justice
some
indirectly
and
many
inadvertently
however
paid
eloquent
tribute
to

picket
from
the
moment
representative

in
opening
the
debate
spoke
of
the
request
for

the

believed
that
millions
of

in
the
nation
should
not
be
denied
the
right
of
having
a

in

to
study
the

of

mistakes
of
some
few
of

one
had
as
well
say
he
went
on
that
there
should
be
no

in

because
the
police
force
of
this
city
permitted
daily
thousands
of
people
to
obstruct
the
streets
and
impede
traffic
and
permitted
almost
the
mobbing
of
the
women
without
arresting
the
offenders
there
was
a
lawful
and
peaceful
way
in
which
the
police
of
this
city
could
have
taken
charge
of
the
banners
of
the
pickets
without
permitting
the
women
carrying
them
to
be

objects
of

violence
to
see

roughly
handled
by
rough
men
on
the
streets
of
the
capital
of

is
not
a
pleasing
sight
to
kentuckians
and
to
americans
and
let
us
hope
the
like
will
never
again
be
seen
here
walsh
an
democrat
from
massachusetts
deplored
taking
any
action
which
would
seem
to
yield
to
the
demand
of
the
pickets
who
carried
banners
which
if
used
by
a
poor
workingman
in
an
attempt
to
get
his
rights
would
speedily
have
put
him
behind
the
bars
for
treason
or
sedition
and
these
poor
bewildered
deluded
creatures
after
their
disgusting
exhibition
can
thank
their
stars
that
because
they
wear
skirts
they
are
now
incarcerated
for
misdemeanors
of

minor
character

supinely

the
gates
of
the
official
residence
even
posing
with
their
short
skirts
and
their
short
hair
within
the
view
of
this
capitol
and
our
office
buildings
with
banners
which
would
seek
to
lead
the
people
to
believe
that
because
we
did
not
take
action
during
this
war
session
upon
suffrage
if
you
please
and
grant
them
the
right
of
the
ballot
that
we
were
traitors
to
the
american
republic
would
be
monstrous
the
subject
of
the
creation
of
a
committee
on
suffrage
was
almost
entirely
forgotten
the
congressmen
were
utterly
unable
to
shake
off
the
ghosts
of
the
pickets
the
pickets
had
not
influenced
their
actions
the
very
idea
was
appalling
to
representative
stafford
of
wisconsin
republican
who
joined
in
the
democratic
protests
he
said
if
a
suffrage
committee
is
created
the
militant
class
will
exclaim
see
how
we
have
driven
the
great
house
of
representatives
to
recognize
our
rights
if
we
keep
up
this
sort
of
practices
we
will
compel
the
house
when
they
come
to
vote
on
the
constitutional
amendment
to
surrender
obediently
likewise
he
spoke
the
truth
and
finished
dramatically
with
gentlemen
there
is
only
one
question
before
the
house
today
and
that
is
if
you
look
at
it
from
a
political
aspect
whether
you
wish
to
approve
of
the
practices
of
these
women
who
have
been
disgracing
their
cause
here
in
washington
for
the
past
several
months
representative
volstead
of
minnesota
republican
came
the
closest
of
all
to
real
courage
in
his
protest
in
this
discussion
some
very
unfair
comments
have
been
made
upon
the
women
who
picketed
the
white
house
while
i
do
not
approve
of
picketing
i
disapprove
more
strongly
of
the
hoodlum
methods
pursued
in
suppressing
the
practice
i
gather
from
the
press
that
this
is
what
took
place
some
women
did
in
a
peaceable
and
perfectly
lawful
manner
display
suffrage
banners
on
the
public
street
near
the
white
house
to
stop
this
the
police
allowed
the
women
to
be
mobbed
and
then
because
the
mob
obstructed
the
street
the
women
were
arrested
and
fined
while
the
mob
went
the
suffrage
committee
in
the
house
was
appointed
the
creation
of
this
committee
which
had
been
pending
since
was
now
finally
granted
in
september
to
be
sure
this
was
accomplished
only
after
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
money
and
effort
had
been
spent
on
a
sustained
and
relentless
campaign
of
pressure
but
the
administration
had
yielded
as
a
means
to
remove
the
pickets
however
this
yielding
had
failed
we
ask
no
more
machinery
we
demand
the
passage
of
the
amendment
said
the
pickets
as
they
lengthened
their
line
chapter
political
prisoners
finding
that
a
suffrage
committee
in
the
house
and
a
report
in
the
senate
had
not
silenced
our
banners
the
administration
cast
about
for
another
plan
by
which
to
stop
the
picketing
this
time
they
turned
desperately
to
longer
terms
of
imprisonment
they
were
indeed
hard
pressed
when
they
could
choose
such
a
cruel
and
stupid
course
our
answer
to
this
policy
was
more
women
on
the
picket
line
on
the
outside
and
a
protest
on
the
inside
of
prison
we
decided
in
the
face
of
extended
imprisonment
to
demand
to
be
treated
as
political
prisoners
we
felt
that
as
a
matter
of
principle
this
was
the
dignified
and
thing
to
do
since
we
had
offended
politically
not
criminally
we
believed
further
that
a
determined
organized
effort
to
make
clear
to
a
wider
public
the
political
nature
of
the
offense
would
intensify
the
administration
embarrassment
and
so
accelerate
their
final
surrender
it
fell
to
lucy
burns
vice
chairman
of
the
organization
to
be
the
leader
of
the
new
protest
miss
burns
is
in
appearance
the
very
symbol
of
woman
in
revolt
her
abundant
and
glorious
red
hair
burns
and
is
not
flaming
torch
her
body
is
strong
and
vital
it
is
said
that
lucy
stone
had
the
voice
of
the
pioneers
lucy
burns
without
doubt
possessed
the
voice
of
the
modern
suffrage
movement
musical
appealing
could
move
the
most
resistant
person
her
talent
as
an
orator
is
of
the
kind
that
makes
for
instant
intimacy
with
her
audience
her
emotional
quality
is
so
powerful
that
her
intellectual
capacity
which
is
quite
as
great
is
not
always
at
once
perceived
i
find
myself
wanting
to
talk
about
her
as
a
human
being
rather
than
as
a
leader
of
women
perhaps
it
is
because
she
has
such
winning
lovable
qualities
it
was
always
difficult
for
her
to
give
all
of
her
energy
and
power
to
a
movement
she
yearned
to
play
to
read
to
study
to
be
luxuriously
indolent
to
revel
in
the
companionship
of
her
family
to
which
she
is
ardently
devoted
to
do
any
one
of
a
hundred
things
more
pleasant
than
trying
to
reason
with
a
politician
or
an
unawakened
member
of
her
own
sex
but
for
these
latter
labors
she
had
a
most
gentle
and
persuasive
genius
and
she
would
not
shrink
from
hours
of
close
argument
to
convince
a
person
intellectually
and
emotionally
unlike
miss
paul
however
her
force
is
not
nonresistant
once
in
the
combat
she
takes
delight
in
it
she
is
by
nature
a
rebel
she
is
an
ideal
leader
for
the
stormy
and
courageous
and
yet
never
to
the
point
of
unwisdom
from
the
time
miss
burns
and
miss
paul
met
for
the
first
time
in
cannon
row
police
station
london
they
have
been
constant
workers
in
suffrage
both
were
students
abroad
at
the
time
they
met
they
were
among
the
hundred
women
arrested
for
attempting
to
present
petitions
for
suffrage
to
parliament
this
was
the
first
time
either
of
them
had
participated
in
a
demonstration
but
from
then
on
they
worked
together
in
england
and
scotland
organizing
speaking
heckling
members
of
the
government
campaigning
at
elections
going
to
holloway
prison
together
where
they
joined
the
englishwomen
on
hunger
strike
miss
burns
remained
organizing
in
scotland
while
miss
paul
was
obliged
to
return
to
america
after
serious
illness
following
a
thirty
day
period
of
imprisonment
during
all
of
which
time
she
was
forcibly
fed
miss
burns
and
she
did
not
meet
again
until
years
having
they
undertook
the
national
work
on
congress
throughout
the
entire
campaign
miss
burns
and
miss
paul
counseled
with
one
another
on
every
point
of
any
importance
this
combination
of
the
cool
strategist
and
passionate
sharing
some
of
the
attributes
of
the
been
a
complete
and
unsurpassed
leadership
you
have
now
been
introduced
most
inadequately
to
lucy
burns
who
was
to
start
the
fight
inside
the
prison
she
had
no
sooner
begun
to
organize
her
comrades
for
protest
than
the
officials
sensed
a
plot
and
removed
her
at
once
to
solitary
confinement
but
they
were
too
late
taking
the
leader
only
hastened
the
rebellion
a
forlorn
piece
of
paper
was
discovered
on
which
was
written
their
initial
demand
it
was
then
passed
from
prisoner
to
prisoner
through
holes
in
the
wall
surrounding
leaden
pipes
until
a
finished
document
had
been
perfected
and
signed
by
all
the
prisoners
this
historic
because
it
represents
the
first
organized
group
action
ever
made
in
america
to
establish
the
status
of
political
to
the
commissioners
of
the
distinct
of
columbia
as
political
prisoners
we
the
undersigned
refuse
to
work
while
in
prison
we
have
taken
this
stand
as
a
matter
of
principle
after
careful
consideration
and
from
it
we
shall
not
recede
this
action
is
a
necessary
protest
against
an
unjust
sentence
in
reminding
president
wilson
of
his
promises
toward
woman
suffrage
we
were
exercising
the
right
of
peaceful
petition
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
declares
peaceful
picketing
is
legal
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
we
are
unjustly
sentenced
has
been
well
president
wilson
pardoned
the
first
group
of
suffragists
who
had
been
given
sixty
days
in
the
workhouse
and
again
when
judge
mullowny
suspended
sentence
for
the
last
group
of
picketers
we
wish
to
point
out
the
inconsistency
and
injustice
of
our
of
us
have
been
given
sixty
days
a
later
group
thirty
days
and
another
group
given
a
suspended
sentence
for
exactly
the
same
action
conscious
therefore
of
having
acted
in
accordance
with
the
highest
standards
of
citizenship
we
ask
the
commissioners
of
the
district
to
grant
us
the
rights
due
political
prisoners
we
ask
that
we
no
longer
be
segregated
and
confined
under
locks
and
bars
in
small
groups
but
permitted
to
see
each
other
and
that
miss
lucy
burns
who
is
in
full
sympathy
with
this
letter
be
released
from
solitary
confinement
in
another
building
and
given
back
to
us
we
ask
exemption
from
prison
work
that
our
legal
right
to
consult
counsel
be
recognized
to
have
food
sent
to
us
from
outside
to
supply
ourselves
with
writing
material
for
as
much
correspondence
as
we
may
need
to
receive
books
letters
newspapers
our
relatives
and
friends
our
united
demand
for
political
treatment
has
been
delayed
because
on
entering
the
workhouse
we
found
conditions
so
very
bad
that
before
we
could
ask
that
the
suffragists
be
treated
as
political
prisoners
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
stand
for
the
ordinary
rights
of
human
beings
for
all
the
inmates
although
this
has
not
been
accomplished
we
now
wish
to
bring
the
important
question
of
the
status
of
political
prisoners
to
the
attention
of
the
commissioners
who
we
are
informed
have
full
authority
to
make
what
regulations
they
please
for
the
district
prison
and
workhouse
the
commissioners
are
requested
to
send
us
a
written
reply
so
that
we
may
be
sure
this
protest
has
reached
them
signed

calnan

annie
arneil
dorothy

margaret
fotheringham
the
commissioners
only
answer
to
this
was
a
hasty
transfer
of
the
signers
and
the
leader
miss
burns
to
the
district
jail
where
they
were
put
in
solitary
confinement
the
women
were
not
only
refused
the
privileges
asked
but
were
denied
some
of
the
usual
privileges
allowed
to
ordinary
criminals
generous
publicity
was
given
to
these
reasonable
demands
and
a
surprisingly
protest
followed
the
official
denial
of
them
scores
of
committees
went
to
the
district
commissioners
telegrams
backing
up
the
women
demand
again
poured
in
upon
all
responsible
administrators
from
president

down
not
even
foreign

or

miss

ambassador
the
following
touching
letter
concerning
her
sister
which
is
translated
from
the
russian
the
russian
ambassador
washington
excellency
i
am
appealing
to
you
to
help
a
young
russian
girl
imprisoned
in
the
workhouse
near
washington
her
name
is
nina
samarodin
i
have
just
come
from
one
of
the
two
monthly
visits
i
am
allowed
to
make
her
as
a
member
of
her
family
the
severity
and
cruelty
of
the
treatment
she
is
receiving
at
occoquan
are
so
much
greater
than
she
would
have
to
suffer
in
russia
for
the
simple
political
offense
she
is
accused
of
having
committed
that
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
intercede
with
the
officials
of
this
country
for
her
her
offense
aside
from
the
fact
that
she
infringed
no
law
nor
disturbed
the
peace
had
only
a
political
aim
and
was
proved
to
be
political
by
the
words
of
the
judge
who
sentenced
her
for
he
declared
that
because
of
the
innocent
inscription
on
her
banner
he
would
make
her
sentence
light
since
her
imprisonment
she
has
been
forced
to
wear
the
dress
of
a
criminal
which
she
would
not
in
russia
she
has
had
to
eat
only
the
coarse
and
unpalatable
food
served
the
criminal
inmates
and
has
not
been
allowed
as
she
would
in
russia
to
have
other
food
brought
to
her
nor
has
she
as
she
would
be
there
been
under
the
daily
care
of
a
physician
she
is
not
permitted
to
write
letters
nor
to
have
free
access
to
books
and
other
implements
of
study
nina
samarodin
has
visibly
lost
in
weight
and
strength
since
her
imprisonment
and
she
has
a
constant
headache
from
hunger
her
motive
in
holding
the
banner
by
the
white
house
i
feel
can
not
but
appeal
to
you
excellency
for
she
says
it
was
the
knowledge
that
her
family
were
fighting
in
russia
in
this
great
war
for
democracy
and
that
she
was
cut
off
from
serving
with
them
that
made
her
desire
to
do
what
she
could
to
help
the
women
of
this
nation
achieve
the
freedom
her
own
people
have
will
you
if
it
is
within
your
power
attempt
to
have
her
recognized
as
a
political
prisoner
and
relieve
the
severity
of
the
treatment
she
is
receiving
for
obeying
this
impulse
born
of
her
love
of
liberty
and
the
dictates
of
her
conscience
i
have
excellency
the
honor
to
be
respectfully
your
countrywoman

baltimore

another
russian
maria
moravsky
author
and
poet
who
had
herself
been
imprisoned
in
czarist
russia
and
who
was
touring
america
at
the
time
of
this
controversy
expressed
her
surprise
that
our
suffrage
prisoners
should
be
treated
as
common
criminals
she
wrote
i
have
been
twice
in
the
russian
prison
life
in
the
solitary
cell
was
not
sweet
but
i
can
assure
you
it
was
better
than
that
which
american
women
suffragists
must
bear
we
were
permitted
to
read
and
write
we
wore
our
own
clothes
we
were
not
forced
to
mix
with
the
criminals
we
did
no
work
only
a
few
women
exiled
to
siberia
for
extremely
serious
political
crimes
were
compelled
to
work
and
our
guardians
and
even
judges
respected
us
they
felt
we
were
victims
because
we
struggled
for
liberty
the
commissioners
who
bad
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
an
answer
to
these
protests
and
to
the
demand
of
the
prisoners
contended
to
all
alike
that
political
prisoners
did
not
exist
we
shall
be
happy
to
establish
a
precedent
said
the
women
but
in
america
stammered
the
commissioners
there
is
no
need
for
such
a
thing
as
political
prisoners
reprinted
from
the
suffragist
the
very
fact
that
we
can
be
sentenced
to
such
long
terms
for
a
political
offense
shows
that
there
does
exist
in
fact
a
group
of
people
who
have
come
into
conflict
with
state
power
for
dissenting
from
the
prevailing
political
system
our
representatives
answered
we
cited
definitions
of
political
offenses
by
eminent
criminologists
penologists
sociologists
statesmen
and
historians
we
declared
that
all
authorities
on
political
crime
sustained
our
contention
and
that
we
clearly
came
under
the
category
of
political
if
any
crime
we
pointed
as
proof
to
james
bryce
george
sigerson
maurice
parmelee
and
even
to
clemenceau
who
defined
the
distinction
between
political
offenses
and
common
law
crimes
thus
theoretically
a
crime
committed
in
the
interest
of
the
criminal
is
a
common
law
crime
while
an
offense
committed
in
the
public
interest
is
a
political
crime
we
called
to
their
attention
the
established
custom
of
special
treatment
of
political
prisoners
in
russia
france
italy
and
even
turkey
we
told
them
that
as
early
as
the
international
prison
congress
meeting
in
london
recommended
a
distinction
in
the
treatment
of
political
and
common
law
criminals
and
the
resolution
of
recommendation
was
agreed
upon
by
the
representatives
of
all

powers

tacit
concurrence
of

and

times
in
which
the
tactics
used
in
the
pursuit
of
political
recognition
may
result
in
a
technical
violation
of
the
law
for
which
imprisonment
ensues
as
witness
the
suffragist
cases
in
washington
these
militants
were
completely
out
of
place
in
a
workhouse
they
could
not
be
made
to
submit
to
discipline
fashioned
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
derelicts
of
society
and
they
therefore
destroyed
it
for
the
entire
institution
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
official
mind
but
that
our
claim
was
just
but
the
administration
would
not
grant
this
demand
as
such
of
political
prisoners
it
must
continue
to
persuade
public
opinion
that
our
offense
was
not
of
a
political
nature
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
unpleasant
and
unfortunate
riotous
conduct
in
the
capital
the
legend
of
a
few
slightly
mad
women
seeking
notoriety
must
be
sustained
our
demand
was
never
granted
but
it
was
kept
up
until
the
last
imprisonment
and
was
soon
reinforced
by
additional
protest
tactics
our
suffrage
prisoners
however
made
an
important
contribution
toward
establishing
this
reform
which
others
will
consummate
they
were
the
first
in
america
to
organize
and
sustain
this
demand
over
a
long
period
of
time
in
america
we
maintain
a
most
backward
policy
in
dealing
with
political
prisoners
we
have
neither
regulation
nor
precedent
for
special
treatment
of
them
nor
have
we
official
flexibility
koren
discusses
the
political
offender
from
the
penological
not
the
social
point
of
view
this
controversy
was
at
its
height
in
the
press
and
in
the
public
mind
when
president
wilson
sent
the
following
message
through
a
new
york
state
suffrage
leader
on
behalf
of
the
approaching
new
york
referendum
on
state
woman
suffrage
may
i
not
express
to
you
my
very
deep
interest
in
the
campaign
in
new
york
for
the
adoption
of
woman
suffrage
and
may
i
not
say
that
i
hope
no
voter
will
be
influenced
in
his
decision
with
regard
to
the
great
matter
by
anything
the
pickets
may
have
done
here
in
washington
however
justly
they
may
have
laid
themselves
open
to
serious
criticism
their
action
represents
i
am
sure
so
small
a
fraction
of
the
women
of
the
country
who
are
urging
the
adoption
of
woman
suffrage
that
it
would
be
most
unfair
and
argue
a
narrow
view
to
allow
their
actions
to
prejudice
the
cause
itself
i
am
very
anxious
to
see
the
great
state
of
new
york
set
a
great
example
in
this
matter
this
statement
showed
a
political
appreciation
of
the
growing
power
of
the
movement
also
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
that
the
small
fraction
had
not
shown
political
wisdom
in
injecting
into
the
campaign
the
embarrassment
of
a
controversy
which
was
followed
by
the
above
statement
of
president
in
the
meantime
he
continued
to
imprison
in
washington
the
pickets
whom
he
hoped
would
not
influence
the
decision
of
the
men
voters
of
new
york
it
will
be
remembered
in
passing
that
the
new
york
voters
adopted
suffrage
at
this
time
although
they
had
rejected
it
two
years
earlier
if
the
voters
of
new
york
were
influenced
at
all
by
the
pickets
could
even
president
wilson
himself
satisfactorily
prove
that
it
had
been
an
adverse
influence
chapter
the
hunger
weapon
when
the
administration
refused
to
grant
the
demand
of
the
prisoners
and
of
that
portion
of
the
public
which
supported
them
for
the
rights
of
political
prisoners
it
was
decided
to
resort
to
the
ultimate
inside
prison
a
hunger
strike
was
undertaken
not
only
to
reinforce
the
verbal
demand
for
the
rights
of
political
prisoners
but
also
as
a
final
protest
against
unjust
imprisonment
and
increasingly
long
sentences
this
brought
the
administration
face
to
face
with
a
more
acute
embarrassment
they
had
to
choose
between
more
stubborn
resistance
and
capitulation
they
continued
for
a
while
longer
on
the
former
path
little
is
known
in
this
country
about
the
weapon
of
the
hunger
strike
and
so
at
first
it
aroused
tremendous
indignation
let
them
starve
to
death
said
the
thoughtless
one
who
did
not
perceive
that
that
was
the
very
thing
a
political
administration
could
least
afford
to
do
mad
fanatics
said
a
kindlier
critic
the
general
opinion
was
that
the
hunger
strike
was
foolish
few
people
realize
that
this
resort
to
the
refusal
of
food
is
almost
as
old
as
civilization
it
has
always
represented
a
passionate
desire
to
achieve
an
end
there
is
not
time
to
go
into
the
religious
use
of
it
which
would
also
be
pertinent
but
i
will
cite
a
few
instances
which
have
tragic
and
amusing
likenesses
to
the
suffrage
hunger
strike
according
to
the
brehon
law
which
was
the
code
of
joyce
a
social
history
of
ancient
ireland
vol
i
chapter
viii
ancient
ireland
by
which
justice
was
administered
under
ancient
irish
monarchs
from
the
earliest
record
to
the
century
it
became
the
duty
of
an
injured
person
when
all
else
failed
to
inflict
punishment
directly
for
wrong
done
the
plaintiff
on
the
defendant
he
went
to
the
house
of
the
defendant
and
sat
upon
his
doorstep
remaining
there
without
food
to
force
the
payment
of
a
debt
for
example
the
debtor
was
compelled
by
the
weight
of
custom
and
public
opinion
not
to
let
the
plaintiff
die
at
his
door
and
yielded
or
if
he
did
not
yield
he
was
practically
outlawed
by
the
community
to
the
point
of
being
driven
away
a
man
who
refused
to
abide
by
the
custom
not
only
incurred
personal
danger
but
lost
all
character
if
resistance
to
this
form
of
protest
was
resorted
to
it
had
to
take
the
form
of
a
if
the
victim
of
such
a
protest
thought
himself
being
unjustly
coerced
he
might
fast
in
opposition
to
mitigate
or
avert
the
evil
fasting
on
a
man
was
also
a
mode
of
compelling
action
of
another
sort
patrick
fasted
against
king
trian
to
compel
him
to
have
compassion
on
his
trian
slaves
he
also
fasted
against
a
heretical
city
to
compel
it
to
become
orthodox
he
fasted
against
the
pagan
king
loeguire
to
constrain
him
to
his
will
this
form
of
hunger
strike
was
further
used
under
the
brehon
law
as
compulsion
to
obtain
a
request
for
example
the
leinstermen
on
one
occasion
fasted
on
columkille
till
they
obtained
from
him
the
promise
that
an
extern
king
should
never
prevail
against
them
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
form
of
direct
action
was
adopted
because
there
was
no
legislative
machinery
to
enforce
justice
these
laws
were
merely
a
collection
of
customs
attaining
the
force
of
law
by
long
usage
by
hereditary
habit
and
by
tripartite
life
of
patrick
clxxvii
ibid
clxxvii
ibid
clxxvii
public
opinion
our
resort
to
this
weapon
grew
out
of
the
same
situation
the
legislative
machinery
while
empowered
to
give
us
redress
failed
to
function
and
so
we
adopted
the
fast
the
institution
of
fasting
on
a
debtor
still
exists
in
the
east
it
is
called
by
the
hindoos
sitting
dharna
the
hunger
strike
was
continuously
used
in
russia
by
prisoners
to
obtain
more
humane
practices
toward
them
kropotkin
cites
an
instance
in
which
women
prisoners
hunger
struck
to
get
their
babies
back
if
a
child
was
born
to
a
woman
during
her
imprisonment
the
babe
was
immediately
taken
from
her
and
not
returned
mothers
struck
and
got
their
babies
returned
to
them
he
cites
another
successful
example
in
rharkoff
prison
in
when
six
prisoners
resolved
to
hunger
strike
to
death
if
necessary
to
win
two
be
allowed
exercise
and
to
have
the
sick
prisoners
taken
out
of
chains
there
are
innumerable
instances
of
hunger
strikes
even
to
death
in
russian
prison
history
but
more
often
the
demands
of
the
strikers
were
breshkovsky
tells
of
a
strike
by
women
against
outrage
which
elicited
the
desired
promises
from
the
warden
as
early
as
members
of
the
land
and
liberty
society
s
imprisoned
for
peaceful
and
educational
propaganda
in
the
schlusselburg
fortress
for
political
prisoners
hunger
struck
against
inhuman
prison
conditions
and
frightful
brutalities
and
won
their
points
during
the
suffrage
campaign
in
england
this
weapon
was
used
for
the
double
purpose
of
forcing
the
release
of
imprisoned
militant
suffragettes
and
of
compelling
the
british
government
to
act
among
the
demonstrations
was
a
revival
of
the
ancient
irish
see
in
russian
and
french
prisons
kropotkin
for
russia
freedom
by
ernest
poole
interview
with
breshkovsky
see
the
russian
bastille
simon
pollock
custom
by
sylvia
pankhurst
who
in
addition
to
her
hunger
strikes
within
prison
fasted
on
the
doorstep
of
premier
asquith
to
compel
him
to
see
a
deputation
of
women
on
the
granting
of
suffrage
to
english
women
she
won
irish
prisoners
have
revived
the
hunger
strike
to
compel
either
release
or
trial
of
untried
prisoners
and
have
lyon
as
i
write
almost
a
hundred
irish
prisoners
detained
by
england
for
alleged
nationalist
activities
but
not
brought
to
trial
hunger
struck
to
freedom
as
a
direct
result
of
this
specific
hunger
strike
england
has
promised
a
renovation
of
her
practices
in
dealing
with
irish
rebels
and
so
it
was
that
when
we
came
to
the
adoption
of
this
accelerating
tactic
we
had
behind
us
more
precedents
for
winning
our
point
than
for
losing
we
were
strong
in
the
knowledge
that
we
could
fast
on
president
wilson
and
his
powerful
administration
and
compel
him
to
act
or
fast
back
among
the
prisoners
who
with
alice
paul
led
the
hunger
strike
was
a
very
picturesque
figure
rose
winslow
ruza
wenclawska
of
new
york
whose
parents
had
brought
her
in
infancy
from
poland
to
become
a
citizen
of
free
america
at
eleven
she
was
put
at
a
loom
in
a
pennsylvania
mill
where
she
wove
hosiery
for
fourteen
hours
a
day
until
tuberculosis
claimed
her
at
nineteen
a
poet
by
nature
she
developed
her
mind
to
the
full
in
spite
of
these
disadvantages
and
when
she
was
forced
to
abandon
her
loom
she
became
an
organizer
for
the
consumers
league
and
later
a
vivid
and
eloquent
power
in
the
suffrage
movement
her
group
preceded
miss
paul
by
about
a
week
in
prison
these
vivid
sketches
of
rose
winslow
impressions
while
in
the
prison
hospital
were
written
on
tiny
scraps
of
paper
and
smuggled
out
to
us
and
to
her
husband
during
her
imprisonment
i
reprint
them
in
their
original
form
with
cuts
but
no
editing
if
this
thing
is
necessary
we
will
naturally
go
through
with
it
force
is
so
stupid
a
weapon
i
feel
so
happy
doing
my
bit
for
our
war
which
is
after
all
real
and
fundamental
the
women
are
all
so
magnificent
so
beautiful
alice
paul
is
as
thin
as
ever
pale
and
we
have
been
in
solitary
for
five
weeks
there
is
nothing
to
tell
but
that
the
days
go
by
somehow
i
have
felt
quite
feeble
the
last
few
days
faint
so
that
i
could
hardly
get
my
hair
brushed
my
arms
ached
so
but
i
am
well
again
alice
paul
and
i
talk
back
and
forth
though
we
are
at
opposite
ends
of
the
building
and
a
hall
door
also
shuts
us
apart
but
occasionally
escape
from
behind
our
doors
and
visit
great
laughter
and
rejoicing
to
her
husband
my
fainting
probably
means
nothing
except
that
i
am
not
strong
after
these
weeks
i
know
you
wo
be
alarmed
told
about
a
syphilitic
colored
woman
with
one
leg
the
other
one
cut
off
having
rotted
so
that
it
was
alive
with
maggots
when
she
came
in
the
remaining
one
is
now
getting
as
bad
they
are
so
short
of
nurses
that
a
little
colored
girl
of
twelve
who
is
here
waiting
to
have
her
tonsils
removed
waits
on
her
this
child
and
two
others
share
a
ward
with
a
syphilitic
child
of
three
or
four
years
whose
mother
refused
to
have
it
at
home
it
makes
you
absolutely
ill
to
see
it
i
am
going
to
break
all
three
windows
as
a
protest
against
their
confining
alice
paul
with
these
gannon
is
chief
of
a
hospital
yet
alice
paul
and
i
found
we
had
been
taking
baths
in
one
of
the
tubs
here
in
which
this
syphilitic
child
an
incurable
who
has
his
eyes
bandaged
all
the
time
is
also
bathed
he
has
been
here
a
year
into
the
room
where
he
lives
came
yesterday
two
children
to
be
operated
on
for
tonsillitis
they
also
bathed
in
the
same
tub
the
syphilitic
woman
has
been
in
that
room
seven
months
cheerful
mixing
is
it
the
place
is
alive
with
roaches
crawling
all
over
the
walls
everywhere
i
found
one
in
my
bed
the
other
day
there
is
great
excitement
about
my
two
syphilitics
each
nurse
is
being
asked
whether
she
told
me
so
as
in
all
institutions
where
an
unsanitary
fact
is
made
public
no
effort
is
made
to
make
the
wrong
itself
right
all
hands
fall
to
to
find
the
culprit
who
made
it
known
and
he
is
punished
alice
paul
is
in
the
psychopathic
ward
she
dreaded
forcible
feeding
frightfully
and
i
hate
to
think
how
she
must
be
feeling
i
had
a
nervous
time
of
it
gasping
a
long
time
afterward
and
my
stomach
rejecting
during
the
process
i
spent
a
bad
restless
night
but
otherwise
i
am
all
right
the
poor
soul
who
fed
me
got
liberally
besprinkled
during
the
process
i
heard
myself
making
the
most
hideous
sounds
one
feels
so
forsaken
when
one
lies
prone
and
people
shove
a
pipe
down
one
stomach
this
morning
but
for
an
astounding
tiredness
i
am
all
right
i
am
waiting
to
see
what
happens
when
the
president
realizes
that
brutal
bullying
is
quite
a
statesmanlike
method
for
settling
a
demand
for
justice
at
home
at
least
if
men
are
supine
enough
to
endure
their
eternal
not
they
took
down
the
boarding
from
alice
paul
window
yesterday
i
heard
it
is
so
delicious
about
alice
and
me
over
in
the
jail
a
rumor
began
that
i
was
considered
insane
and
would
be
examined
then
came
doctor
white
and
said
he
had
come
to
see
thyroid
case
when
they
left
we
argued
about
the
matter
neither
of
us
knowing
which
was
considered
cious
she
insisted
it
was
she
and
as
it
happened
she
was
right
imagine
any
one
thinking
alice
paul
needed
to
be
observation
the
idiots
yesterday
was
a
bad
day
for
me
in
feeding
i
was
vomiting
continually
during
the
process
the
tube
has
developed
an
irritation
somewhere
that
is
painful
never
was
there
a
sentence
like
ours
for
such
an
offense
as
ours
even
in
england
no
woman
ever
got
it
over
there
even
for
tearing
down
buildings
and
during
all
that
agitation
we
were
busy
saying
that
never
would
such
things
happen
in
the
united
states
the
men
told
us
they
would
not
endure
such
frightfulness
mary
beard
and
helen
todd
were
allowed
to
stay
only
a
minute
and
i
cried
like
a
fool
i
am
getting
over
that
habit
i
think
i
fainted
again
last
night
i
just
fell
flop
over
in
the
bathroom
where
i
was
washing
my
hands
and
was
led
to
bed
when
i
recovered
by
a
nurse
i
lost
consciousness
just
as
i
got
there
again
i
felt
horribly
faint
until
then
fell
asleep
for
awhile
i
was
getting
frantic
because
you
seemed
to
think
alice
was
with
me
in
the
hospital
she
was
in
the
psychopathic
ward
the
same
doctor
feeds
us
both
and
told
me
do
let
them
tell
you
we
take
this
well
miss
paul
vomits
much
i
do
too
except
when
not
nervous
as
i
have
been
every
time
against
my
will
i
try
to
be
less
it
the
nervous
reaction
and
i
control
it
much
i
do
imagine
bathing
one
food
in
tears
very
good
for
one
we
think
of
the
coming
feeding
all
day
it
is
horrible
sentence
of
seven
months
for
obstructing
traffic
the
doctor
thinks
i
take
it
well
i
hate
the
thought
of
alice
paul
and
the
others
if
i
take
it
well
we
still
get
no
mail
we
are
it
strange
is
it
if
you
ask
for
food
fit
to
eat
as
we
did
you
are
and
if
you
refuse
food
you
are
amusing
i
am
really
all
right
if
this
continues
very
long
i
perhaps
wo
be
i
am
interested
to
see
how
long
our
american
men
will
stand
for
this
form
of
discipline
all
news
cheers
one
marvelously
because
it
is
hard
to
feel
anything
but
a
bit
desolate
and
forgotten
here
in
this
place
all
the
officers
here
know
we
are
making
this
hunger
strike
that
women
fighting
for
liberty
may
be
considered
political
prisoners
we
have
told
them
god
knows
we
do
want
other
women
ever
to
have
to
do
this
over
again
there
have
been
sporadic
and
isolated
cases
of
hunger
strikes
in
this
country
but
to
my
knowledge
ours
was
the
first
to
be
organized
and
sustained
over
a
long
period
of
time
we
shall
see
in
subsequent
chapters
how
effective
this
weapon
was
chapter
administration
terrorism
the
administration
tried
in
another
way
to
stop
picketing
it
sentenced
the
leader
alice
paul
to
the
absurd
and
desperate
sentence
of
seven
months
in
the
washington
jail
for
obstructing
traffic
with
the
leader
safely
behind
the
bars
for
so
long
a
time
the
agitation
would
certainly
weaken
so
thought
the
administration
to
their
great
surprise
however
in
the
face
of
that
reckless
and
extreme
sentence
the
longest
picket
line
of
the
entire
campaign
formed
at
the
white
house
in
the
late
afternoon
of
november
women
picketed
in
protest
against
this
wanton
persecution
of
their
leader
as
well
as
against
the
delay
in
passing
the
amendment
face
to
face
with
an
embarrassing
number
of
prisoners
the
administration
used
its
wits
and
decided
to
reduce
the
number
to
a
manageable
size
before
imprisoning
this
group
failing
of
that
they
tried
still
another
way
out
they
resorted
to
imprisonment
with
terrorism
in
order
to
show
how
widely
representative
of
the
nation
this
group
of

there
were
exceptionally
dramatic
figures
in
this
group
mary
nolan
of
florida
years
old
frail
in
health
but
militant
in
spirit
said
she
had
come
to
take
her
place
with
the
women
struggling
for
liberty
in
the
same
spirit
that
her
revolutionary
ancestor
eliza
zane
had
carried
bullets
to
the
fighters
in
the
war
for
independence
harvey
wiley
looked
appealing
and
beautiful
as
she
said
in
court
we
took
this
action
with
great
consecration
of
spirit
with
willingness
to
sacrifice
personal
liberty
for
al
the
women
of
the
country
judge
mullowny
addressed
the
prisoners
with
many
words
about
the
seriousness
of
obstructing
the
traffic
in
the
national
capital
and
inadvertently
slipped
into
a
discourse
on
russia
and
the
dangers
of
revolution
we
always
wondered
why
the
government
was
not
clever
enough
to
eliminate
political
discourses
at
least
during
trials
where
the
offenders
were
charged
with
breaking
a
slight
regulation
but
their
minds
were
too
full
of
the
political
aspect
of
our
offense
to
conceal
it
the
truth
of
the
situation
is
that
the
court
has
not
been
given
power
to
meet
it
the
judge
lamented
it
is
very
very
find
you
guilty
of
the
offense
charged
but
will
take
the
matter
of
sentence
under
advisement
and
so
the
guilty
pickets
were
summarily
released
the
administration
did
not
relish
the
incarceration
of
women
for
another
reason
than
limited
housing
accommodations
women
representing
sixteen
states
in
the
union
might
create
a
considerable
political
dislocation
but
these
same
women
were
determined
to
force
the
administration
to
take
its
choice
it
could
allow
them
to
continue
their
peaceful
agitation
or
it
could
stand
the
reaction
which
was
bound
to
come
from
imprisoning
them
and
so
the
women
returned
to
the
white
house
gates
to
resume
their
picketing
they
stood
guard
several
minutes
before
the
police
taken
unawares
could
summon
sufficient
force
to
arrest
them
and
commandeer
enough
cars
to
carry
them
to
police
headquarters
as
the
philadelphia
north
american
pointed
out
there
was
no
disorder
the
crowd
waited
with
interest
and
in
a
noticeably
friendly
spirit
to
see
what
would
happen
there
were
frequent
references
to
the
pluck
of
the
silent
sentinels
the
following
morning
the
women
were
ordered
by
judge
mullowny
to
come
back
on
friday
i
am
not
yet
prepared
to
try
the
case
logic
dictated
that
either
we
had
a
right
to
stand
at
the
gates
with
our
banners
or
we
did
not
have
that
right
but
the
administration
was
not
interested
in
logic
it
had
to
stop
picketing
whether
this
was
done
legally
or
illegally
logically
or
illogically
clumsily
or
dexterously
was
of
secondary
importance
picketing
must
be
stopped
using
their
welcome
release
to
continue
their
protest
the
women
again
marched
with
their
banners
to
the
white
house
in
an
attempt
to
picket
again
they
were
arrested
no
one
who
saw
that
line
will
ever
forget
the
impression
it
made
not
only
on
friends
of
the
suffragists
but
on
the
general
populace
of
washington
to
see
these
women
force
with
such
magnificent
defiance
the
hand
of
a
wavering
administration
on
the
following
morning
they
were
sentenced
to
from
six
days
to
six
months
in
prison
miss
burns
received
six
months
in
pronouncing
the
lightest
sentence
upon
nolan
the
judge
said
that
he
did
so
on
account
of
her
age
he
urged
her
however
to
pay
her
fine
hinting
that
jail
might
be
too
severe
on
her
and
might
bring
on
death
at
this
suggestion
tiny
nolan
pulled
herself
up
on
her
toes
and
said
with
great
dignity
your
honor
i
have
a
nephew
fighting
for
democracy
in
france
he
is
offering
his
life
for
his
country
i
should
be
ashamed
if
i
did
not
join
these
brave
women
in
their
fight
for
democracy
in
america
i
should
be
proud
of
the
honor
to
die
in
prison
for
the
liberty
of
american
women
even
the
judge
seemed
moved
by
her
beautiful
and
simple
spirit
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
women
were
sentenced
to
serve
their
sentences
in
the
district
jail
where
they
would
join
miss
paul
and
her
companions
all
save
one
were
immediately
sent
to
occoquan
workhouse
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
demand
to
be
treated
as
political
prisoners
inaugurated
by
previous
pickets
should
be
continued
and
that
failing
to
secure
such
rights
they
would
unanimously
refuse
to
eat
food
or
do
prison
labor
any
words
of
mine
would
be
inadequate
to
tell
the
story
of
the
prisoners
reception
at
the
occoquan
workhouse
the
following
is
the
statement
of
nolan
dictated
upon
her
release
in
the
presence
of
dudley
field
malone
it
was
about
half
past
seven
at
night
when
we
got
to
occoquan
workhouse
a
woman
herndon
was
standing
behind
a
desk
when
we
were
brought
into
this
office
and
there
were
five
or
six
men
also
in
the
room
lewis
who
spoke
for
all
of
us
said
she
must
speak
to
whittaker
the
superintendent
of
the
place
you
sit
here
all
night
then
said
herndon
i
saw
men
begin
to
come
upon
the
porch
but
i
did
think
anything
about
it
herndon
called
my
name
but
i
did
not
answer
suddenly
the
door
literally
burst
open
and
whittaker
burst
in
like
a
tornado
some
men
followed
him
we
could
see
a
crowd
of
them
on
the
porch
they
were
not
in
uniform
they
looked
as
much
like
tramps
as
anything
they
seemed
to
come
in
one
had
a
face
that
made
me
think
of
an
lewis
stood
up
some
of
us
had
been
sitting
and
lying
on
the
floor
we
were
so
tired
she
had
hardly
begun
to
speak
saying
we
demanded
to
be
treated
as
political
prisoners
when
whittaker
said
you
shut
up
i
have
men
here
to
handle
you
then
he
shouted
seize
her
i
turned
and
saw
men
spring
toward
her
and
then
some
one
screamed
they
have
taken
mrs
lewis
a
man
sprang
at
me
and
caught
me
by
the
shoulder
i
am
used
to
remembering
a
bad
foot
which
i
have
had
for
years
and
i
remember
saying
i
come
with
you
do
drag
me
i
have
a
lame
foot
but
i
was
jerked
down
the
steps
and
away
into
the
dark
i
did
have
my
feet
on
the
ground
i
guess
that
saved
me
i
heard
cosu
who
was
being
dragged
along
with
me
call
be
careful
of
your
foot
out
of
doors
it
was
very
dark
the
building
to
which
they
took
us
was
lighted
up
as
we
came
to
it
i
only
remember
the
american
flag
flying
above
it
because
it
caught
the
light
from
a
window
in
the
wing
we
were
rushed
into
a
large
room
that
we
found
opened
on
a
large
hall
with
stone
cells
on
each
side
they
were
perfectly
dark
punishment
cells
is
what
they
call
them
mine
was
filthy
it
had
no
window
save
a
slip
at
the
top
and
no
furniture
but
an
iron
bed
covered
with
a
thin
straw
pad
and
an
open
toilet
flushed
from
outside
the
cell
in
the
hall
outside
was
a
man
called
captain
reems
he
had
on
a
uniform
and
was
brandishing
a
thick
stick
and
shouting
as
we
were
shoved
into
the
corridor
damn
you
get
in
here
i
saw
dorothy
day
brought
in
she
is
a
frail
girl
the
two
men
handling
her
were
twisting
her
arms
above
her
head
then
suddenly
they
lifted
her
up
and
banged
her
down
over
the
arm
of
an
iron
as
they
ran
me
past
she
was
lying
there
with
her
arms
out
and
we
heard
one
of
the
men
yell
the
suffrager
my
mother
ai
no
suffrager
i
put
you
through
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
they
pushed
me
through
a
door
then
i
lost
my
balance
and
fell
against
the
iron
bed
cosu
struck
the
wall
then
they
threw
in
two
mats
and
two
dirty
blankets
there
was
no
light
but
from
the
corridor
the
door
was
barred
from
top
to
bottom
the
walls
and
floors
were
brick
or
stone
cemented
over
cosu
would
not
let
me
lie
on
the
floor
she
put
me
on
the
couch
and
stretched
out
on
the
floor
on
one
of
the
two
pads
they
threw
in
we
had
only
lain
there
a
few
minutes
trying
to
get
our
breath
when
lewis
doubled
over
and
handled
like
a
sack
of
something
was
literally
thrown
in
her
head
struck
the
iron
bed
we
thought
she
was
dead
she
move
we
were
crying
over
her
as
we
lifted
her
to
the
pad
on
my
bed
when
we
heard
miss
burns
call
where
is
mrs
nolan
i
replied
i
am
here
cosu
called
out
they
have
just
thrown
lewis
in
here
too
at
this
whittaker
came
to
the
door
and
told
us
not
to
dare
to
speak
or
he
would
put
the
brace
and
bit
in
our
mouths
and
the
straitjacket
on
our
bodies
we
were
so
terrified
we
kept
very
still
lewis
was
not
unconscious
she
was
only
stunned
but
cosu
was
desperately
ill
as
the
night
wore
on
she
had
a
bad
heart
attack
and
was
then
vomiting
we
called
and
called
we
asked
send
our
own
doctor
because
we
thought
she
was
dying
they
the
guards
paid
no
attention
a
cold
wind
blew
in
on
us
from
the
outside
and
we
three
lay
there
shivering
and
only
half
conscious
until
morning
one
at
a
time
come
out
we
heard
some
one
call
at
the
barred
door
early
in
the
morning
i
went
first
i
bade
them
both
by
i
did
know
where
i
was
going
or
whether
i
would
ever
see
them
again
they
took
me
to
whittaker
office
where
he
called
my
name
you
mary
nolan
said
whittaker
you
posted
said
i
are
you
willing
to
put
on
prison
dress
and
go
to
the
workroom
said
he
i
said
no
do
you
know
now
that
i
am
whittaker
the
superintendent
he
asked
is
there
any
age
limit
to
your
workhouse
i
said
would
a
woman
of
or
a
child
of
two
be
sent
here
i
think
i
made
him
think
he
motioned
to
the
guard
get
a
doctor
to
examine
her
he
said
in
the
hospital
cottage
i
was
met
by
herndon
and
taken
to
a
little
room
with
two
white
beds
and
a
hospital
table
you
can
lie
down
if
you
want
to
she
said
i
took
off
my
coat
and
hat
i
just
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
fell
into
a
kind
of
stupor
it
was
nearly
noon
and
i
had
had
no
food
offered
me
since
the
sandwiches
our
friends
brought
us
in
the
courtroom
at
noon
the
day
before
the
doctor
came
and
examined
my
heart
then
he
examined
my
lame
foot
it
had
a
long
blue
bruise
above
the
ankle
where
they
had
knocked
me
as
they
took
me
across
the
night
before
he
asked
me
what
caused
the
bruise
i
said
those
fiends
when
they
dragged
me
to
the
cell
last
night
it
was
paining
me
he
asked
if
i
wanted
liniment
and
i
said
only
hot
water
they
brought
that
and
i
noticed
they
did
not
lock
the
door
a
negro
trusty
was
there
i
fell
back
again
into
the
same
stupor
the
next
day
they
brought
me
some
toast
and
a
plate
of
food
the
first
i
had
been
offered
in
over
hours
i
just
looked
at
the
food
and
motioned
it
away
it
made
me
sick
i
was
released
on
the
sixth
day
and
passed
the
dispensary
as
i
came
out
there
were
a
group
of
my
friends
brannan
and
morey
and
many
others
they
had
on
coarse
striped
dresses
and
big
grotesque
heavy
shoes
i
burst
into
tears
as
they
led
me
away
signed
mary
nolan
november
the
day
following
their
commitment
to
occoquan
of
counsel
was
directed
to
see
the
women
to
ascertain
their
condition
friends
and
relatives
were
alarmed
as
not
a
line
of
news
had
been
allowed
to
penetrate
to
the
world
was
denied
admission
and
forced
to
come
back
to
washington
without
any
report
whatsoever
the
next
day
again
attempted
to
see
his
clients
as
did
also
the
mother
of
miss
matilda
young
the
youngest
prisoner
in
whittaker
care
and
miss
katherine
morey
who
went
asking
to
see
her
mother
miss
morey
was
held
under
armed
guard
half
a
mile
from
the
prison
admission
was
denied
to
all
of
them
the
terrible
anxiety
at
headquarters
was
not
relieved
the
third
day
by
a
report
brought
from
the
workhouse
by
one
of
the
marines
stationed
at
quantico
station
virginia
who
had
been
summoned
to
the
workhouse
on
the
night
the
women
arrived
he
brought
news
that
unknown
tortures
were
going
on
immediately
forced
his
way
through
by
a
court
order
and
brought
back
to
headquarters
the
astounding
news
of
the
campaign
of
terrorism
which
had
started
the
moment
the
prisoners
had
arrived
and
which
was
being
continued
at
that
moment
miss
lucy
burns
who
had
assumed
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
the
women
had
managed
to
secrete
small
scraps
of
paper
and
a
tiny
pencil
and
jot
down
briefly
the
day
by
day
events
at
the
workhouse
this
week
of
brutality
which
rivaled
old
russia
if
it
did
not
outstrip
it
was
almost
the
blackest
page
in
the
cruel
fight
against
women
here
are
some

the
weight
gannon

forced
the

through
my
lips
and
down
my
throat
i
gasping
and
suffocating
with
the
agony
of
it
i
did

from

everything
turned
black
when
the
fluid
began
pouring
in
i
was
moaning
and
making
the
most
awful
sounds
quite
against
my
will
for
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
my
friends
in
the
next
room
finally
the

was
withdrawn

our

we
were

and
i
placed

at
all
this
morning
ladd
appeared
with

i
said
we

said
he
would
call
in

guards
and
force
us
to
submit
went
away
and
we
were
not
fed
at
all
this
morning
we
hear
them
outside
now
cracking
eggs
with
miss
burns
and
lewis
who
were
regarded
as
leaders
in
the
hunger
strike
protest
removed
to
the
district
jail
whittaker
and
his
staff
at
occoquan
began
a
systematic
attempt
to
break
down
the
morale
of
the
hunger
strikers
each
one
was
called
to
the
mat
and
interrogated
will
you
work
will
you
put
on
prison
clothes
will
you
eat
will
you
stop
picketing
will
you
go
without
paying
your
fine
and
promise
never
to
picket
again
how
baffled
he
must
have
been
the
answer
was
definite
and
final
their
resistance
was
superb
one
of
the
few
warning
incidents
during
the
gray
days
of
our
imprisonment
was
the
unexpected
sympathy
and
understanding
of
one
of
the
government
doctors
wrote
miss
betty
gram
of
portland
oregon
is
the
most
magnificent
sacrifice
i
have
ever
seen
made
for
a
principle
he
said
i
never
believed
that
american
women
would
care
so
much
about
freedom
i
have
seen
women
in
russia
undergo
extreme
suffering
for
their
ideals
but
unless
i
had
seen
this
with
my
own
eyes
i
never
would
have
believed
it
my
sister
hunger
struck
in
russia
where
she
was
imprisoned
for
refusing
to
reveal
the
whereabouts
of
two
of
her
friends
indicted
for
a
government
offense
she
was
fed
after
three
days
you
girls
are
on
your
ninth
day
of
hunger
strike
and
your
condition
is
critical
it
is
a
great
pity
that
such
women
should
be
subjected
to
this
treatment
i
hope
that
you
will
carry
your
point
and
force
the
hand
of
the
government
soon
the
mother
of
matilda
young
the
youngest
picket
anxiously
appealed
to
tumulty
secretary
to
president
wilson
and
a
family
friend
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
president
and
ask
for
a
special
order
to
visit
her
daughter
failing
to
secure
this
she
went
daily
to
tumulty
office
asking
if
he
himself
would
not
intercede
for
her
tumulty
assured
her
that
her
daughter
was
in
safe
hands
that
she
need
give
herself
no
alarm
the
stories
of
the
inhuman
treatment
at
occoquan
were
false
and
that
she
must
not
believe
them
finally
young
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
send
additional
warm
clothing
to
her
daughter
whom
she
knew
to
be
too
lightly
clad
for
the
vigorous
temperature
of
november
tumulty
assured
her
that
the
women
were
properly
clothed
and
refused
to
permit
the
clothing
to
be
sent
the
subsequent
stories
of
the
women
showed
what
agonies
they
had
endured
because
they
were
inadequately
clad
from
the
dampness
of
the
cells
into
which
they
were
thrown
john
winters
brannan
was
among
the
women
who
endured
the
night
of
terror
brannan
is
the
daughter
of
charles
dana
founder
of
the
new
york
sun
and
that
great
american
patriot
of
liberty
who
was
a
trusted
associate
counselor
of
abraham
lincoln
brannan
suffragist
is
an
aristocrat
of
intellect
and
feeling
who
has
always
allied
herself
with
libertarian
movements
this
was
her
second
term
of
imprisonment
she
wrote
a
comprehensive
affidavit
of
her
experience
after
narrating
the
events
which
led
up
to
the
attack
she
continues
superintendent
whittaker
then
shouted
out
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
seize
these
women
take
them
off
that
one
that
one
take
her
off
the
guards
rushed
forward
and
an
almost
indescribable
scene
of
violent
confusion
ensued
i
saw
one
of
the
guards
seize
her
lucy
burns
by
the
arms
twist
or
force
them
back
of
her
and
one
or
two
other
guards
seize
her
by
the
shoulders
shaking
her
violently
i
then
took
up
my
heavy
sealskin
coat
which
was
lying
by
and
put
it
on
in
order
to
prepare
myself
if
attacked
i
was
trembling
at
the
time
and
was
stunned
with
terror
at
the
situation
as
it
had
developed
and
said
to
the
superintendent
i
will
give
my
name
under
protest
and
started
to
walk
towards
the
desk
whereon
lay
the
books
the
superintendent
shouted
to
me
oh
no
you
wo
do
talk
about
protest
i
wo
have
any
of
that
nonsense
i
saw
the
guards
seizing
the
different
women
of
the
party
with
the
utmost
violence
the
furniture
being
overturned
and
the
room
a
scene
of
the
utmost
disturbance
i
saw
miss
lincoln
lying
on
the
floor
with
every
appearance
of
having
just
been
thrown
down
by
the
two
guards
who
were
standing
over
her
in
a
menacing
attitude
seeing
the
general
disturbance
i
gave
up
all
idea
of
giving
my
name
at
the
desk
and
instinctively
joined
my
companions
to
go
with
them
and
share
whatever
was
in
store
for
them
the
whole
group
of
women
were
thrown
dragged
or
herded
out
of
the
office
on
to
the
porch
down
the
steps
to
the
ground
and
forced
to
cross
the
road
to
the
administration
building
during
all
of
this
time
superintendent
whittaker
was
directing
the
whole
attack
of
us
were
thrown
into
different
cells
in
the
prison
i
being
put
in
one
with
four
other
women
the
cell
containing
a
narrow
bed
and
one
chair
which
was
immediately
removed
during
the
time
that
we
were
being
forced
into
the
cells
the
guards
kept
up
an
uproar
shouting
banging
the
iron
doors
clanging
bars
making
a
terrifying
noise
i
and
one
of
my
companions
were
lying
down
on
the
narrow
bed
on
which
were
a
blanket
and
one
pillow
the
door
of
the
cell
was
opened
and
a
mattress
and
a
blanket
being
thrown
in
the
door
was
violently
banged
to
my
other
companions
arranged
the
mattress
on
the
floor
and
lay
down
covering
themselves
with
the
blanket
i
looked
across
the
corridor
and
saw
miss
lincoln
and
asked
her
whether
she
was
all
right
being
anxious
to
know
whether
she
had
been
hurt
by
the
treatment
in
the
office
building
instantly
superintendent
whittaker
rushed
forward
shouting
at
me
stop
that
not
another
word
from
your
mouth
or
i
will
handcuff
you
gag
you
and
put
you
in
a
straitjacket
i
wish
to
state
again
that
the
cells
into
which
we
were
put
were
situated
in
the
men
prison
there
was
no
privacy
for
the
women
and
if
any
of
us
wished
to
undress
we
would
be
subject
to
the
view
or
observation
of
the
guards
who
remained
in
the
corridor
and
who
could
at
any
moment
look
at
us
furthermore
the
water
closets
were
in
full
view
of
the
corridor
where
superintendent
whittaker
and
the
guards
were
moving
about
the
flushing
of
these
closets
could
only
be
done
from
the
corridor
and
we
were
forced
to
ask
the
guards
to
do
this
for
us
men
who
had
shortly
before
attacked
us
none
of
the
matrons
or
women
attendants
appeared
at
any
time
that
night
no
water
was
brought
to
us
for
washing
no
food
was
offered
to
us
i
was
exhausted
by
what
i
had
seen
and
been
through
and
spent
the
night
in
absolute
terror
of
further
attack
and
of
what
might
still
be
in
store
for
us
i
thought
of
the
young
girls
who
were
with
us
and
feared
for
their
safety
the
guards
acted
brutal
in
the
extreme
incited
to
their
brutal
conduct
towards
us
by
the
superintendent
i
thought
of
the
offense
with
which
we
had
been
charged
that
of
obstructing
traffic
felt
that
the
treatment
that
we
had
received
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
offense
with
which
we
were
charged
and
that
the
superintendent
the
matron
and
guards
would
not
have
dared
to
act
towards
us
as
they
had
acted
unless
they
relied
upon
the
support
of
higher
authorities
it
seemed
to
me
that
everything
had
been
done
from
the
time
we
reached
the
workhouse
to
terrorize
us
and
my
fear
lest
the
extreme
of
outrage
would
be
worked
upon
the
young
girls
of
our
party
became
intense
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
describe
the
terror
of
that
night
the
affidavit
then
continues
with
the
story
of
how
brannan
was
compelled
the
following
morning
to
put
on
prison
clothes
was
given
a
cup
of
skimmed
milk
and
a
slice
of
toast
and
then
taken
to
the
sewing
room
where
she
was
put
to
work
sewing
on
the
underdrawers
of
the
male
prisoners
i
was
half
fainting
all
of
that
day
and
requested
permission
to
lie
down
feeling
so
ill
i
could
not
sleep
having
a
sense
of
constant
danger
i
was
almost
paralyzed
and
in
wretched
physical
condition
on
friday
afternoon
herndon
matron
led
us
through
some
woods
nearby
for
about
of
a
mile
seven
of
us
being
in
the
party
we
were
so
exhausted
and
weary
that
we
were
obliged
to
stop
constantly
to
rest
on
our
way
back
from
the
walk
we
heard
the
baying
of
hounds
very
near
us
in
the
woods
the
matron
said
you
must
hurry
the
bloodhounds
are
loose
one
of
the
party
miss
findeisen
asked
whether
they
would
attack
us
to
which
the
matron
replied
that
is
just
what
they
would
do
and
hurried
us
along
the
baying
grew
louder
and
nearer
at
times
and
then
more
distant
as
the
dogs
rushed
back
and
forth
and
this
went
on
until
we
reached
the
sewing
room
the
effect
of
this
upon
our
nerves
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
every
conceivable
lie
was
tried
in
an
effort
to
force
the
women
to
abandon
their
various
form
of
resistance
they
were
told
that
no
efforts
were
being
made
from
the
outside
to
reach
them
and
that
their
attorney
had
been
called
off
the
case
each
one
was
told
that
she
was
the
only
one
hunger
striking
each
one
was
told
that
all
the
others
had
put
on
prison
clothes
and
were
working
although
they
were
separated
from
one
another
they
suspected
the
lies
and
remained
strong
in
their
resistance
after
one
visit
and
the
subsequent
reports
in
the
press
he
was
thereafter
refused
admission
to
the
workhouse
the
judge
had
sentenced
these
women
to
the
jail
but
the
district
commissioners
had
ordered
them
committed
to
the
workhouse
it
was
evident
that
the
administration
was
anxious
to
keep
this
group
away
from
alice
paul
and
her
companions
as
they
counted
on
handling
the
rebellion
more
easily
in
two
groups
than
one
meanwhile
the
condition
of
the
prisoners
in
the
workhouse
grew
steadily
worse
it
was
imperative
that
we
force
the
ministration
to
take
them
out
of
the
custody
of
superintendent
whittaker
immediately
we
decided
to
take
the
only
course
obtain
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
a
hurried
journey
by
counsel
to
united
states
district
judge
waddill
of
norfolk
virginia
brought
the
writ
it
compelled
the
government
to
bring
the
prisoners
into
court
and
show
cause
why
they
should
not
be
returned
to
the
district
jail
this
conservative
southern
judge
said
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
it
is
shocking
and
curdling
there
followed
a
week
more
melodramatic
than
the
most
stirring
moving
picture
film
although
the
writ
had
been
applied
for
in
the
greatest
secrecy
a
detective
suddenly
appeared
to
accompany
from
washington
to
norfolk
during
his
stay
in
norfolk
and
back
to
washington
telephone
wires
at
our
headquarters
were
tapped
it
was
evident
that
the
administration
was
cognizant
of
every
move
in
this
procedure
before
it
was
executed
no
sooner
was
our
plan
decided
upon
than
friends
of
the
administration
besought
us
to
abandon
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
one
member
of
the
administration
sent
an
emissary
to
our
headquarters
with
the
following
appeal
if
you
will
only
drop
these
proceedings
i
can
absolutely
guarantee
you
that
the
prisoners
will
be
removed
from
the
workhouse
to
the
jail
in
a
week
in
a
week
they
may
be
dead
by
that
time
we
answered
we
can
not
wait
but
i
tell
you
you
must
not
proceed
why
this
mysterious
week
we
asked
why
not
tomorrow
why
not
instantly
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
have
a
positive
guarantee
of
the
district
commissioners
that
the
women
will
be
removed
he
said
in
conclusion
we
refused
to
grant
his
request
there
were
three
reasons
why
the
authorities
wished
for
a
time
they
were
afraid
to
move
the
women
in
their
weakened
condition
and
before
the
end
of
the
week
they
hoped
to
increase
their
facilities
for
forcible
feeding
at
the
workhouse
they
also
wished
to
conceal
the
treatment
of
the
women
the
exposure
of
which
would
be
inevitable
in
any
court
proceedings
and
lastly
the
administration
was
anxious
to
avoid
opening
up
the
whole
question
of
the
legality
of
the
very
existence
of
the
workhouse
in
virginia
persons
convicted
in
the
district
for
acts
committed
in
violation
of
district
law
were
transported
to
serve
their
terms
it
was
a
moot
point
whether
prisoners
were
so
treated
with
sufficient
warrant
in
law
eminent
jurists
held
that
the
district
had
no
right
to
convict
a
person
under
its
laws
and
commit
that
person
to
confinement
in
another
state
they
contended
that
sentence
imposed
upon
a
person
for
unlawful
acts
in
the
district
should
be
executed
in
the
district
hundreds
of
persons
who
had
been
convicted
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
who
had
served
their
sentences
in
virginia
had
been
without
money
or
influence
enough
to
contest
this
doubtful
procedure
in
the
courts
the
administration
was
alarmed
we
quickened
our
pace
a
member
of
the
administration
rushed
his
attorney
as
courier
to
the
women
in
the
workhouse
to
implore
them
not
to
consent
to
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
he
was
easily
admitted
and
tried
to
extort
from
one
prisoner
at
a
time
a
promise
to
reject
the
plan
the
women
suspected
his
solicitude
and
refused
to
make
any
promise
whatsoever
without
first
being
allowed
to
see
their
own
attorney
we
began
at
once
to
serve
the
writ
ordinarily
this
would
be
an
easy
thing
to
do
but
for
us
it
developed
into
a
very
difficult
task
a
deputy
marshal
must
serve
the
writ
counsel
sought
a
deputy
for
miles
around
not
one
was
to
be
found
at
his
home
or
lodgings
none
could
be
reached
by
telephone
meanwhile
whittaker
had
sped
from
the
premises
of
the
workhouse
to
the
district
where
he
kept
himself
discreetly
hidden
for
several
days
when
a
deputy
was
found
six
attempts
were
made
to
serve
the
writ
all
failed
finally
by
a
ruse
whittaker
was
caught
at
his
home
late
at
night
he
was
aroused
to
a
state
of
violent
temper
and
made
futile
threats
of
reprisal
when
he
learned
that
he
must
produce
the
suffrage
prisoners
at
the
court
in
alexandria

great
passions
when
they
run
through
a
whole
population
inevitably
find
a
great
spokesman
a
people
can
not
remain
dumb
which
is
moved
by
profound
impulses
of
conviction
and
when
spokesmen
and
leaders
are
found
effective
concert
of
action
seems
to
follow
as
naturally
men
spring
together
for
common
action
under
a
common
impulse
which
has
taken
hold
upon
their
very
natures
and
governments
presently
find
that
they
have
those
to
reckon
with
who
know
not
only
what
they
want
but
also
the
most
effective
means
of
making
governments
uncomfortable
until
they
get
it
governments
find
themselves
in
short
in
the
presence
of
agitation
of
systematic
movements
of
opinion
which
do
not
merely
flare
up
in
spasmodic
flames
and
then
die
down
again
but
burn
with
an
accumulating
ardor
which
can
be
checked
and
extinguished
only
by
removing
the
grievances
and
abolishing
the
unacceptable
institutions
which
are
its
fuel
casual
discontent
can
be
allayed
but
agitation
fixed
upon
conviction
can
not
be
to
fight
it
is
merely
to
augment
its
force
it
burns
irrepressibly
in
every
public
assembly
quiet
it
there
and
it
gathers
head
at
street
corners
drive
it
thence
and
it
smolders
in
private
dwellings
in
social
gatherings
in
every
covert
of
talk
only
to
break
forth
more
violently
than
ever
because
denied
vent
and
air
it
must
be
reckoned
with
governments
have
been
very
resourceful
in
parrying
agitation
in
diverting
it
in
seeming
to
yield
to
it
and
then
cheating
it
of
its
objects
in
tiring
it
out
or
evading
it
but
the
end
whether
it
comes
soon
or
late
is
quite
certain

be

the

congress
known
as
the

congress
adjourned
in
october
having
passed
every
measure
recommended
as
a
war
measure
by
the
president
in
addition
it
found
time
to
protect

migratory

to
appropriate

for

and
to
establish

no
honest
person
would
say
that
lack
of
time
and
pressure
of
war
legislation
had
prevented
its
consideration
of
the
suffrage
measure
if
part
of
the
time
consumed
by
its
members
in
spreading
the
wings
of
the
overworked
eagle
and
in
uttering
to
bored
ears
patriotic
verse
had
been
spent
in
considering
the
liberty
of
women
this
important
legislation
could
have
been
dealt
with
week
after
week
congress
met
only
for
three
days
and
then
often
merely
for
prayer
and
a
few
hours
of
purposeless
talking
we
had
asked
for
liberty
and
had
got
a
suffrage
committee
appointed
in
the
house
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
suffrage
and
a
favorable
report
in
the
senate
from
the
committee
on
woman
suffrage
nothing
more
on
the
very
day
and
hour
of
the
adjournment
of
the
special
session
of
the
war
congress
alice
paul
led
eleven
women
to
the
white
house
gates
to
protest
against
the
allowing
its
lawmakers
to
go
home
without
action
on
the
suffrage
amendment
two
days
later
alice
paul
and
her
colleagues
were
put
on
trial
many
times
during
previous
trials
i
had
heard
the
district
attorney
for
the
government
shake
his
finger
at
miss
paul
and
say
we
get
you
yet
just
wait
and
when
we
do
give
you
a
year
it
was
reported
from
very
authentic
sources
that
attorney
general
gregory
had
earlier
in
the
agitation
seriously
considered
arresting
miss
paul
for
the
administration
on
the
charge
of
conspiracy
to
break
the
law
we
were
told
this
plan
was
abandoned
because
as
one
of
the
attorney
general
staff
put
it
no
jury
would
convict
her
however
here
she
was
in
their
hands
in
the
courtroom
proceedings
opened
with
the
customary
formality
the
eleven
prisoners
sat
silently
at
the
bar
reading
their
morning
papers
or
a
book
or
enjoying
a
moment
of
luxurious
idleness
oblivious
of
the
comical
movements
of
a
perturbed
court
nothing
in
the
world
so
baffles
the
pompous
dignity
of
a
court
as
defendants
the
judge
cleared
his
throat
and
the
attendants
made
meaningless
gestures
will
the
prisoners
stand
up
and
be
sworn
they
will
not
will
they
question
witnesses
they
will
not
will
they
speak
in
their
own
behalf
the
slender
quaker
girl
arose
from
her
seat
the
crowded
courtroom
pressed
forward
breathlessly
she
said
calmly
and
with
unconcern
we
do
not
wish
to
make
any
plea
before
this
court
we
do
not
consider
ourselves
subject
to
this
court
since
as
an
unenfranchised
class
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
making
of
the
laws
which
have
put
us
in
this
position
what
a
disconcerting
attitude
to
take
miss
paul
sat
down
as
quietly
and
unexpectedly
as
she
had
arisen
the
judge
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
the
gentle
way
in
which
it
was
said
was
disarming
would
the
judge
hold
them
in
contempt
he
had
not
time
to
think
his
part
of
the
comedy
he
had
expected
to
run
smoothly
and
here
was
this
defiant
little
woman
calmly
stating
that
we
were
not
subject
to
the
court
and
that
we
would
therefore
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
proceedings
the
murmurs
had
grown
to
a
babel
of
conversation
a
sharp
rap
of
the
gavel
restored
order
and
permitted
judge
mullowny
to
say
unfortunately
i
am
here
to
support
the
laws
that
are
made
by
congress
and
of
course
i
am
bound
by
those
laws
and
you
are
bound
by
them
as
long
as
you
live
in
this
country
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
you
do
not
recognize
the
law
everybody
strained
his
ears
for
the
sentence
the
administration
had
threatened
to
get
the
leader
would
they
dare
another
pause
i
shall
suspend
sentence
for
the
time
being
came
solemnly
from
the
judge
was
it
that
they
did
not
dare
confine
miss
paul
were
they
beginning
actually
to
perceive
the
real
strength
of
the
movement
and
the
protest
that
would
be
aroused
if
she
were
imprisoned
again
we
thought
perhaps
this
marked
the
end
of
the
jailing
of
women
but
though
the
pickets
were
released
on
suspended
sentences
there
was
no
indication
of
any
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
administration
of
acting
on
the
amendment
two
groups
some
of
those
on
suspended
sentence
others
first
offenders
again
marched
to
the
white
house
gates
the
following
motto
the
time
has
come
to
conquer
or
submit
for
us
there
can
be

one
have
made
it

sergeant

were
you
on
pennsylvania

near
the

saturday

sergeant

i
was
hart
at
what
time
lee
about
in
the
afternoon
hart
tell
the
court
what
you
saw
lee
a
little
after
four
when
the
department
clerks
were
all
going
home
out
pennsylvania
avenue
i
saw
four
suffragettes
coming
down
madison
place
cross
the
avenue
and
continue
on
pennsylvania
avenue
to
the
gate
of
the
white
house
where
they
divided
two
on
the
right
and
two
on
the
left
side
of
the
gate
hart
what
did
you
do
lee
i
made
my
way
through
the
crowd
that
was
surrounding
them
and
told
the
ladies
they
were
violating
the
law
by
standing
at
the
gates
and
would
they
please
move
on
hart
did
they
move
on
lee
they
did
not
and
they
did
answer
either
hart
what
did
you
do
then
lee
i
placed
them
under
arrest
hart
what
did
you
do
then
lee
i
asked
the
crowd
to
move
on
hart
then
arose
and
summing
up
said
your
honor
these
women
have
said
that
they
will
picket
again
i
ask
you
to
impose
the
maximum
sentence
such
confused
legal
logic
was
indeed
drole
you
ladies
seem
to
feel
that
we
discriminate
in
making
arrests
and
in
sentencing
you
said
the
judge
heavily
the
result
is
that
you
force
me
to
take
the
most
drastic
means
in
my
power
to
compel
you
to
obey
the
law
more
legal
confusion
six
months
said
the
judge
to
the
first
offenders
and
then
you
will
serve
one
month
more
to
the
others
miss
paul
parting
remark
to
the
reporters
who
intercepted
her
on
her
way
from
the
courtroom
to
begin
her
seven
months
sentence
was
we
are
being
imprisoned
not
because
we
obstructed
traffic
but
because
we
pointed
out
to
the
president
the
fact
that
he
was
obstructing
the
cause
of
democracy
at
home
while
americans
were
fighting
for
it
abroad
i
am
going
to
let
alice
paul
tell
her
own
story
as
she
related
it
to
me
one
day
after
her
release
it
was
late
afternoon
when
we
arrived
at
the
jail
there
we
found
the
suffragists
who
had
preceded
us
locked
in
cells
the
first
thing
i
remember
was
the
distress
of
the
prisoners
about
the
lack
of
fresh
air
evening
was
approaching
every
window
was
closed
tight
the
air
in
which
we
would
be
obliged
to
sleep
was
foul
there
were
about
eighty
negro
and
white
prisoners
crowded
together
tier
upon
tier
frequently
two
in
a
cell
i
went
to
a
window
and
tried
to
open
it
instantly
a
group
of
men
prison
guards
appeared
picked
me
up
bodily
threw
me
into
a
cell
and
locked
the
door
rose
winslow
and
the
others
were
treated
in
the
same
way
determined
to
preserve
out
health
and
that
of
the
other
prisoners
we
began
a
concerted
fight
for
fresh
air
the
windows
were
about
twenty
feet
distant
from
the
cells
and
two
sets
of
iron
bars
intervened
between
us
and
the
windows
but
we
instituted
an
attack
upon
them
as
best
we
could
our
tin
drinking
cups
the
electric
light
bulbs
every
available
article
of
the
meagre
supply
in
each
cell
including
my
treasured
copy
of
browning
poems
which
i
had
secretly
taken
in
with
me
was
thrown
through
the
windows
by
this
simultaneous
attack
from
every
cell
we
succeeded
in
breaking
one
window
before
our
supply
of
tiny
weapons
was
exhausted
the
fresh
october
air
came
in
like
an
exhilarating
gale
the
broken
window
remained
untouched
throughout
the
entire
stay
of
this
group
and
all
later
groups
of
suffragists
thus
was
won
what
the
regulars
in
jail
called
the
first
breath
of
air
in
their
time
the
next
day
we
organized
ourselves
into
a
little
group
for
the
purpose
of
rebellion
we
determined
to
make
it
impossible
to
keep
us
in
jail
we
determined
moreover
that
as
long
as
we
were
there
we
would
keep
up
an
unremitting
fight
for
the
rights
of
political
prisoners
one
by
one
little
points
were
conceded
to
quiet
resistance
there
was
the
practice
of
sweeping
the
corridors
in
such
a
way
that
the
dust
filled
the
cells
the
prisoners
would
be
choking
to
the
gasping
point
as
they
sat
helpless
locked
in
the
cells
while
a
great
cloud
of
dust
enveloped
them
from
tiers
above
and
below
as
soon
as
our
tin
drinking
cups
which
were
sacrificed
in
our
attack
upon
the
windows
were
restored
to
us
we
instituted
a
campaign
against
the
dust
tin
cup
after
tin
cup
was
filled
and
its
contents
thrown
out
into
the
corridor
from
every
cell
so
that
the
water
began
to
trickle
down
from
tier
to
tier
the
district
commissioners
the
board
of
charities
and
other
officials
were
summoned
by
the
prison
authorities
hurried
consultations
were
held
nameless
officials
passed
by
in
review
and
looked
upon
the
dampened
floor
thereafter
the
corridors
were
dampened
and
the
sweeping
into
the
cells
ceased
and
so
another
reform
was
won
there
is
absolutely
no
privacy
allowed
a
prisoner
in
a
cell
you
are
suddenly
peered
at
by
curious
strangers
who
look
in
at
you
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
by
officials
by
attendants
by
interested
philanthropic
visitors
and
by
prison
reformers
until
one
sense
of
privacy
is
so
outraged
that
one
rises
in
rebellion
we
set
out
to
secure
privacy
but
we
did
not
succeed
for
to
allow
privacy
in
prison
is
against
all
institutional
thought
and
habit
our
only
available
weapon
was
our
blanket
which
was
no
sooner
put
in
front
of
our
bars
than
it
was
forcibly
taken
down
by
warden
zinkhan
our
meals
had
consisted
of
a
little
almost
raw
salt
pork
some
sort
of
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
coffee
or
and
occasionally
molasses
how
we
cherished
the
bread
and
molasses
we
saved
it
from
meal
to
meal
so
as
to
try
to
distribute
the
nourishment
over
a
longer
period
as
almost
every
one
was
unable
to
eat
the
raw
pork
lucy
branham
who
was
more
valiant
than
the
rest
of
us
called
out
from
her
cell
one
day
shut
your
eyes
tight
close
your
mouth
over
the
pork
and
swallow
it
without
chewing
it
then
you
can
do
it
this
heroic
practice
kept
miss
branham
in
fairly
good
health
but
to
the
rest
it
seemed
impossible
even
with
our
eyes
closed
to
crunch
our
teeth
into
the
raw
pork
however
gaily
you
start
out
in
prison
to
keep
up
a
rebellious
protest
it
is
nevertheless
a
terribly
difficult
thing
to
do
in
the
face
of
the
constant
cold
and
hunger
of
undernourishment
bread
and
water
and
occasional
molasses
is
not
a
diet
destined
to
sustain
rebellion
long
and
soon
weakness
overtook
us
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
of
solitary
confinement
without
any
exercise
without
going
outside
of
our
cells
some
of
the
prisoners
were
released
having
finished
their
terms
but
five
of
us
were
left
serving
seven
months
sentences
and
two
one
month
sentences
with
our
number
thus
diminished
to
seven
the
authorities
felt
able
to
cope
with
us
the
doors
were
unlocked
and
we
were
permitted
to
take
exercise
rose
winslow
fainted
as
soon
as
she
got
into
the
yard
and
was
carried
back
to
her
cell
i
was
too
weak
to
move
from
my
bed
rose
and
i
were
taken
on
stretchers
that
night
to
the
hospital
for
one
brief
night
we
occupied
beds
in
the
same
ward
in
the
hospital
here
we
decided
upon
the
hunger
strike
as
the
ultimate
form
of
protest
left
strongest
weapon
left
with
which
to
continue
within
the
prison
our
battle
against
the
administration
miss
paul
was
held
absolutely
incommunicado
in
the
prison
hospital
no
attorney
no
member
of
her
family
no
friend
could
see
her
with
miss
burns
in
prison
also
it
became
imperative
that
i
consult
miss
paul
as
to
a
matter
of
policy
i
was
peremptorily
refused
admission
by
warden
zinkhan
so
i
decided
to
attempt
to
communicate
with
her
from
below
her
window
this
was
before
we
had
established
what
in
prison
parlance
is
known
as
the
vine
route
the
route
consists
of
smuggling
messages
oral
or
written
via
a
friendly
guard
or
prisoner
who
has
access
to
the
outside
world
just
before
twilight
i
hurried
in
a
taxi
to
the
spot
temporarily
abandoned
the
cab
and
walked
past
the
dismal
cemetery
which
skirts
the
prison
grounds
i
had
fortified
myself
with
a
diagram
of
the
grounds
and
knew
which
entrance
to
attempt
in
order
to
get
to
the
hospital
wing
where
miss
paul
lay
we
had
also
ascertained
her
floor
and
room
i
must
first
pick
the
right
building
proceed
to
the
proper
corner
and
finally
select
the
proper
window
the
sympathetic
chauffeur
loaned
me
a
very
seedy
looking
overcoat
which
i
wrapped
about
me
having
deposited
my
hat
inside
the
cab
i
turned
up
the
collar
drew
in
my
chin
and
began
surreptitiously
to
circle
the
devious
paths
leading
to
a
side
entrance
of
the
grounds
my
heart
was
palpitating
for
the
authorities
had
threatened
arrest
if
any
suffragists
were
found
on
the
prison
grounds
and
aside
from
my
personal
feelings
i
could
not
at
that
moment
abandon
headquarters
making
a
desperate
effort
to
act
like
an
experienced
and
trusted
attendant
of
the
prison
i
roamed
about
and
tried
not
to
appear
roaming
i
successfully
passed
two
guards
and
reached
the
desired
spot
which
was
by
good
luck
temporarily
deserted
i
succeeded
in
calling
up
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
by
miss
paul
but
softly
enough
not
to
be
heard
by
the
guards
i
shall
never
forget
the
shock
of
her
appearance
at
that
window
in
the
gathering
dusk
everything
in
the
world
seemed
except
her
face
so
startling
so
inaccessible
it
drove
everything
else
from
my
mind
for
an
instant
but
as
usual
she
was
in
complete
control
of
herself
she
began
to
hurl
questions
at
me
faster
than
i
could
answer
how
were
the
convention
plans
progressing
had
the
speakers
been
secured
for
the
mass
meeting
how
many
women
had
signed
up
to
go
out
on
the
next
picket
line
and
so
on
conditions
at
occoquan
are
frightful
said
i
we
are
planning
to
get
out
of
there
and
move
quickly
shouted
the
guard
who
came
abruptly
around
the
corner
of
the
building
i
tried
to
finish
my
message
we
are
planning
to
habeas
corpus
the
women
out
of
occoquan
and
have
them
transferred
up
here
get
out
of
there
i
tell
you
damn
you
by
this
time
he
was
upon
me
he
grabbed
me
by
the
arm
and
began
shaking
me
you
will
be
arrested
if
you
do
not
get
off
these
grounds
he
continued
to
shake
me
while
i
shouted
back
do
you
approve
of
this
plan
i
was
being
forced
along
so
rapidly
that
i
was
out
of
range
of
her
faint
voice
and
could
not
hear
the
answer
i
plead
with
the
guard
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
quietly
and
speak
a
few
more
words
with
miss
paul
but
he
was
inflexible
once
out
of
the
grounds
i
went
unnoticed
to
the
cemetery
and
sat
on
a
tombstone
to
wait
a
little
while
before
making
another
attempt
hoping
the
guard
would
not
expect
me
to
come
back
the
lights
were
beginning
to
twinkle
in
the
distance
and
it
was
now
almost
total
darkness
i
consulted
any
watch
and
realized
that
in
forty
minutes
miss
paul
and
her
comrades
would
again
be
going
through
the
torture
of
forcible
feeding
i
waited
five
minutes
then
i
went
back
to
the
grounds
again
i
started
through
another
entrance
but
had
proceeded
only
a
few
paces
when
i
was
forcibly
evicted
again
i
returned
to
the
cold
tombstone
i
believe
that
i
never
in
my
life
felt
more
utterly
miserable
and
impotent
there
were
times
as
i
have
said
when
we
felt
inordinately
strong
this
was
one
of
the
times
when
i
felt
that
we
were
frail
reeds
in
the
hands
of
cruel
and
powerful
oppressors
my
thoughts
were
at
first
with
alice
paul
at
that
moment
being
forcibly
fed
by
men
jailers
and
men
doctors
i
remembered
then
the
man
warden
who
had
refused
the
highly
reasonable
request
to
visit
her
and
my
thoughts
kept
right
on
up
the
scale
till
i
got
to
the
pinnacle
of
power
against
us
i
was
indeed
desolate
i
walked
back
to
the
hidden
taxi
hurried
to
headquarters
and
plunged
into
my
work
trying
all
night
to
convince
myself
that
the
sting
of
my
wretchedness
was
being
mitigated
by
activity
toward
a
release
from
this
state
of
affairs
later
we
established
daily
communication
with
miss
paul
through
one
of
the
charwomen
who
scrubbed
the
hospital
floors
she
carried
paper
and
pencil
carefully
concealed
upon
her
on
entering
miss
paul
room
she
would
with
very
comical
stealth
first
elaborately
push
miss
paul
bed
against
the
door
then
crawl
practically
under
it
and
pass
from
this
point
of
concealment
the
coveted
paper
and
pencil
then
she
would
linger
over
the
floor
to
the
last
second
imploring
miss
paul
to
hasten
her
writing
faithfully
every
evening
this
silent
dusky
messenger
made
her
long
journey
after
her
day
work
and
patiently
waited
while
i
wrote
an
answering
note
to
be
delivered
to
miss
paul
the
following
morning
thus
it
was
that
while
in
the
hospital
miss
paul
directed
our
campaign
in
spite
of
the
administration
most
painstaking
plans
to
the
contrary
miss
paul
story
continues
here
from
the
point
where
i
interrupted
it
from
the
moment
we
undertook
the
hunger
strike
a
policy
of
unremitting
intimidation
began
one
authority
after
another
high
and
low
in
and
out
of
prison
came
to
attempt
to
force
me
to
break
the
hunger
strike
you
will
be
taken
to
a
very
unpleasant
place
if
you
do
stop
this
was
a
favorite
threat
of
the
prison
officials
as
they
would
hint
vaguely
of
the
psychopathic
ward
and
elizabeth
the
government
insane
asylum
they
alternately
bullied
and
hinted
another
threat
was
you
will
be
forcibly
fed
immediately
if
you
do
stop
from
gannon
there
was
nothing
to
do
in
the
midst
of
these
continuous
threats
with
always
the
very
unpleasant
place
hanging
over
me
and
so
i
lay
perfectly
silent
on
my
bed
after
about
three
days
of
the
hunger
strike
a
man
entered
my
room
in
the
hospital
and
announced
himself
as
white
the
head
of
elizabeth
he
said
that
he
had
been
asked
by
district
commissioner
gardner
to
make
an
investigation
i
later
learned
that
he
was
william
a
white
the
eminent
alienist
coming
close
to
my
bedside
and
addressing
the
attendant
who
stood
at
a
few
respectful
paces
from
him
white
said
does
this
case
talk
why
would
i
talk
i
answered
quickly
oh
these
cases
frequently
will
not
talk
you
know
he
continued
in
explanation
indeed
i
talk
i
said
gaily
not
having
the
faintest
idea
that
this
was
an
investigation
of
my
sanity
talking
is
our
business
i
continued
we
talk
to
any
one
on
earth
who
is
willing
to
listen
to
our
suffrage
speeches
please
talk
said
white
tell
me
about
suffrage
why
you
have
opposed
the
president
the
whole
history
of
your
campaign
why
you
picket
what
you
hope
to
accomplish
by
it
just
talk
freely
i
drew
myself
together
sat
upright
in
bed
propped
myself
up
for
a
discourse
of
some
length
and
began
to
talk
the
stenographer
whom
white
brought
with
him
took
down
in
shorthand
everything
that
was
said
i
may
say
it
was
one
of
the
best
speeches
i
ever
made
i
recited
the
long
history
and
struggle
of
the
suffrage
movement
from
its
early
beginning
and
narrated
the
political
theory
of
our
activities
up
to
the
present
moment
outlining
the
status
of
the
suffrage
amendment
in
congress
at
that
time
in
short
i
told
him
everything
he
listened
attentively
interrupting
only
occasionally
to
say
but
has
not
president
wilson
treated
you
women
very
badly
whereupon
i
still
unaware
that
i
was
being
examined
launched
forth
into
an
explanation
of
political
situation
and
the
difficulties
he
had
confronting
him
i
continued
to
explain
why
we
felt
our
relief
lay
with
him
i
cited
his
extraordinary
power
his
influence
over
his
party
his
undisputed
leadership
in
the
country
always
painstakingly
explaining
that
we
opposed
president
wilson
merely
because
he
happened
to
be
president
not
because
he
was
president
wilson
again
came
an
interruption
from
white
but
is
president
wilson
directly
responsible
for
the
abuses
anal
indignities
which
have
been
heaped
upon
you
you
are
suffering
now
as
a
result
of
his
brutality
are
you
not
again
i
explained
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
know
whether
president
wilson
was
personally
acquainted
in
any
detail
with
the
facts
of
our
present
condition
even
though
we
knew
that
he
had
concurred
in
the
early
decision
to
arrest
our
women
presently
white
took
out
a
small
light
and
held
it
up
to
my
eyes
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
me
that
he
was
examining
me
personally
that
his
interest
in
the
suffrage
agitation
and
the
jail
conditions
did
not
exist
and
that
he
was
merely
interested
in
my
reactions
to
the
agitation
and
to
jail
even
then
i
was
reluctant
to
believe
that
i
was
the
subject
of
mental
investigation
and
i
continued
to
talk
but
he
continued
in
what
i
realized
with
a
sudden
shock
was
an
attempt
to
discover
in
me
symptoms
of
the
persecution
mania
how
simple
he
had
apparently
thought
it
would
be
to
prove
that
i
had
an
obsession
on
the
subject
of
president
wilson
the
day
following
he
came
again
this
time
bringing
with
him
the
district
commissioner
gardner
to
whom
he
asked
me
to
repeat
everything
that
had
been
said
the
day
before
for
the
second
time
we
went
through
the
history
of
the
suffrage
movement
and
again
his
inquiry
suggested
his
persecution
mania
clue
when
the
narrative
touched
upon
the
president
and
his
responsibility
for
the
obstruction
of
the
suffrage
amendment
white
would
turn
to
his
associate
with
the
remark
note
the
reaction
then
came
another
alienist
hickling
attached
to
the
psychopathic
ward
in
the
district
jail
with
more
threats
and
suggestions
if
the
hunger
strike
continued
finally
they
departed
and
i
was
left
to
wonder
what
would
happen
next
doubtless
my
sense
of
humor
helped
me
but
i
confess
a
was
not
without
fear
of
this
mysterious
place
which
they
continued
to
threaten
it
appeared
clear
that
it
was
their
intention
either
to
discredit
me
as
the
leader
of
the
agitation
by
casting
doubt
upon
my
sanity
or
else
to
intimidate
us
into
retreating
from
the
hunger
strike
after
the
examination
by
the
alienists
commissioner
gardner
with
whom
i
had
previously
discussed
our
demand
for
treatment
as
political
prisoners
made
another
visit
all
these
things
you
say
about
the
prison
conditions
may
be
true
said
gardner
i
am
a
new
commissioner
and
i
do
not
know
you
give
an
account
of
a
very
serious
situation
in
the
jail
the
jail
authorities
give
exactly
the
opposite
now
i
promise
you
we
will
start
an
investigation
at
once
to
see
who
is
right
you
or
they
if
it
is
found
you
are
right
we
shall
correct
the
conditions
at
once
if
you
will
give
up
the
hunger
strike
we
will
start
the
investigation
at
once
will
you
consent
to
treat
the
suffragists
as
political
prisoners
in
accordance
with
the
demands
laid
before
you
i
replied
commissioner
gardner
refused
and
i
told
him
that
the
hunger
strike
would
not
be
abandoned
but
they
had
by
no
means
exhausted
every
possible
facility
for
breaking
down
our
resistance
i
overheard
the
commissioner
say
to
gannon
on
leaving
go
ahead
take
her
and
feed
her
i
was
thereupon
put
upon
a
stretcher
and
carried
into
the
psychopathic
ward
there
were
two
windows
in
the
room
gannon
immediately
ordered
one
window
nailed
from
top
to
bottom
he
then
ordered
the
door
leading
into
the
hallway
taken
down
and
an
cell
door
put
in
its
place
he
departed
with
the
command
to
a
nurse
to
observe
her
following
this
direction
all
through
the
day
once
every
hour
the
nurse
came
to
observe
me
all
through
the
night
once
every
hour
she
came
in
turned
on
an
electric
light
sharp
in
my
face
and
observed
me
this
ordeal
was
the
most
terrible
torture
as
it
prevented
my
sleeping
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
if
i
did
finally
get
to
sleep
it
was
only
to
be
shocked
immediately
into
with
the
pitiless
light
hickling
the
jail
alienist
also
came
often
to
observe
me
commissioner
gardner
and
officials
came
to
peer
through
my
barred
door
one
day
a
young
interne
came
to
take
a
blood
test
i
protested
mildly
saying
that
it
was
unnecessary
and
that
i
objected
oh
well
said
the
young
doctor
with
a
sneer
and
a
supercilious
shrug
you
know
you
not
mentally
competent
to
decide
such
things
and
the
test
was
taken
over
my
protest
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
convey
to
you
one
reaction
to
such
an
atmosphere
here
i
was
surrounded
by
people
on
their
way
to
the
insane
asylum
some
were
waiting
for
their
commitment
papers
others
had
just
gotten
them
and
all
the
while
everything
possible
was
done
to
attempt
to
make
me
feel
that
i
too
was
a
mental
patient
at
this
time
forcible
feeding
began
in
the
district
jail
miss
paul
and
miss
winslow
the
first
two
suffragists
to
undertake
the
hunger
strike
went
through
the
operation
of
forcible
feeding
this
day
and
three
times
a
day
on
each
succeeding
day
until
their
release
from
prison
three
weeks
later
the
hunger
strike
spread
immediately
to
other
suffrage
prisoners
in
the
jail
and
to
the
workhouse
as
recorded
in
the
preceding
chapter
one
morning
miss
paul
story
continues
the
friendly
face
of
a
kindly
old
man
standing
on
top
of
a
ladder
suddenly
appeared
at
my
window
he
began
to
nail
heavy
boards
across
the
window
from
the
outside
he
smiled
and
spoke
a
few
kind
words
and
told
me
to
be
of
good
cheer
he
confided
to
me
in
a
sweet
and
gentle
way
that
he
was
in
prison
for
drinking
that
he
had
been
in
many
times
but
that
he
believed
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
inhuman
as
boarding
up
this
window
and
depriving
a
prisoner
of
light
and
air
there
was
only
time
for
a
few
hurried
moments
of
conversation
as
i
lay
upon
my
bed
watching
the
boards
go
up
until
his
figure
was
completely
hidden
and
i
heard
him
descending
the
ladder
after
this
window
had
been
boarded
up
no
light
came
into
the
room
except
through
the
top
half
of
the
other
window
and
almost
no
air
the
authorities
seemed
determined
to
deprive
me
of
air
and
light
meanwhile
in
those
gray
long
days
the
mental
patients
in
the
psychopathic
ward
came
and
peered
through
my
barred
door
at
night
in
the
early
morning
all
through
the
day
there
were
cries
and
shrieks
and
moans
from
the
patients
it
was
terrifying
one
particularly
melancholy
moan
used
to
keep
up
hour
after
hour
with
the
regularity
of
a
heart
beat
i
said
to
myself
now
i
have
to
endure
this
i
have
got
to
live
through
this
somehow
i
pretend
these
moans
are
the
noise
of
an
elevated
train
beginning
faintly
in
the
distance
and
getting
louder
as
it
comes
nearer
such
childish
devices
were
helpful
to
me
the
nurses
could
not
have
been
more
beautiful
in
their
spirit
and
offered
every
kindness
but
imagine
being
greeted
in
the
morning
by
a
kindly
nurse
a
new
one
who
had
just
come
on
duty
with
i
know
you
are
not
insane
the
nurses
explained
the
procedure
of
sending
a
person
to
the
insane
asylum
two
alienists
examine
a
patient
in
the
psychopathic
ward
sign
an
order
committing
the
patient
to
elizabeth
asylum
and
there
the
patient
is
sent
at
the
end
of
one
week
no
trial
no
counsel
no
protest
from
the
outside
world
this
was
the
customary
procedure
i
began
to
think
as
the
week
wore
on
that
this
was
probably
their
plan
for
me
i
could
not
see
my
family
or
friends
counsel
was
denied
me
i
saw
no
other
prisoners
and
heard
nothing
of
them
i
could
see
no
papers
i
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
alienists
prison
officials
and
hospital
staff
i
believe
i
have
never
in
my
life
before
feared
anything
or
any
human
being
but
i
confess
i
was
afraid
of
gannon
the
jail
physician
i
dreaded
the
hour
of
his
visit
i
will
show
you
who
rules
this
place
you
think
you
do
but
i
will
show
you
that
you
are
wrong
some
such
friendly
greeting
as
this
was
frequent
from
gannon
on
his
daily
round
anything
you
desire
you
shall
not
have
i
will
show
you
who
is
on
top
in
this
institution
was
his
attitude
after
nearly
a
week
had
passed
dudley
field
malone
finally
succeeded
in
forcing
an
entrance
by
an
appeal
to
court
officials
and
made
a
vigorous
protest
against
confining
me
in
the
psychopathic
ward
he
demanded
also
that
the
boards
covering
the
window
be
taken
down
this
was
promptly
done
and
again
the
friendly
face
of
the
old
man
became
visible
as
the
first
board
disappeared
i
thought
when
i
put
this
up
america
would
not
stand
for
this
long
he
said
and
began
to
assure
me
that
nothing
dreadful
would
happen
i
cherish
the
memory
of
that
sweet
old
man
the
day
after
malone
threat
of
court
proceedings
the
seventh
day
of
my
stay
in
the
psychopathic
ward
the
attendants
suddenly
appeared
with
a
stretcher
i
did
not
know
whither
i
was
being
taken
to
the
insane
asylum
as
threatened
or
back
to
the
never
knows
in
prison
where
one
is
being
taken
no
reason
is
ever
given
for
anything
it
turned
out
to
be
the
hospital
after
another
week
spent
by
miss
paul
on
hunger
strike
in
the
hospital
the
administration
was
forced
to
capitulate
the
doors
of
the
jail
were
suddenly
opened
and
all
suffrage
prisoners
were
released
with
extraordinary
swiftness
the
administration
almost
incredible
policy
of
intimidation
had
collapsed
miss
paul
had
been
given
the
maximum
sentence
of
seven
months
and
at
the
end
of
five
weeks
the
administration
was
forced
to
acknowledge
defeat
they
were
in
a
most
unenviable
position
if
she
and
her
comrades
had
offended
in
such
degree
as
to
warrant
so
cruel
a
sentence
with
such
base
stupidity
on
their
part
in
administering
it
she
most
certainly
deserved
to
be
detained
for
the
full
sentence
the
truth
is
every
idea
of
theirs
had
been
subordinated
to
the
one
desire
of
stopping
the
picketing
agitation
to
this
end
they
had
exhausted
all
their
weapons
of
force
from
my
conversation
and
correspondence
with
white
it
is
clear
that
as
an
alienist
he
did
not
make
the
slightest
allegation
to
warrant
removing
miss
paul
to
the
psychopathic
ward
on
the
contrary
he
wrote
i
felt
myself
in
the
presence
of
an
unusually
gifted
personality
and
she
was
wonderfully
alert
and
keen
possessed
of
an
absolute
conviction
of
her
cause
with
industry
and
courage
sufficient
to
avail
herself
of
them
all
diplomatic
possibilities
he
praised
the
most
admirable
coherent
logical
and
forceful
way
in
which
she
discussed
with
him
the
purpose
of
our
campaign
and
yet
the
administration
put
her
in
the
psychopathic
ward
and
threatened
her
with
the
insane
asylum
an
interesting
incident
occurred
during
the
latter
part
of
miss
paul
imprisonment
having
been
cut
off
entirely
from
outside
communication
she
was
greatly
surprised
one
night
at
a
late
hour
to
find
a
newspaper
man
admitted
for
an
interview
with
her
david
lawrence
then
generally
accepted
as
the
administration
journalist
and
one
who
wrote
for
the
various
newspapers
throughout
the
country
defending
the
policies
of
the
wilson
administration
was
announced
it
was
equally
well
known
that
this
correspondent
habit
was
to
ascertain
the
position
of
the
leaders
on
important
questions
keeping
mately
in
touch
with
opinion
in
white
house
circles
at
the
same
time
lawrence
came
as
he
said
of
his
own
volition
and
not
as
an
emissary
from
the
white
house
but
in
view
of
his
close
relation
to
affairs
his
interview
is
significant
as
possibly
reflecting
an
administration
attitude
at
that
point
in
the
campaign
the
conversation
with
miss
paul
revolved
first
about
our
fight
for
the
right
of
political
prisoners
miss
paul
outlining
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
this
demand
the
administration
could
very
easily
hire
a
comfortable
house
in
washington
and
detain
you
all
there
said
lawrence
but
do
you
see
that
your
demand
to
be
treated
as
political
prisoners
is
infinitely
more
difficult
to
grant
than
to
give
you
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
if
we
give
you
these
privileges
we
shall
have
to
extend
them
to
conscientious
objectors
and
to
all
prisoners
now
confined
for
political
opinions
this
the
administration
can
not
do
the
political
prisoners
protest
then
had
actually
encouraged
the
administration
to
choose
the
lesser
of
two
evils
some
action
on
behalf
of
the
amendment
suppose
continued
lawrence
the
administration
should
pass
the
amendment
through
one
house
of
congress
next
session
and
go
to
the
country
in
the
elections
on
that
record
and
if
sustained
in
it
pass
it
through
the
other
house
a
year
from
now
would
you
then
agree
to
abandon
picketing
nothing
short
of
the
passage
of
the
amendment
through
congress
will
end
our
agitation
miss
paul
quietly
answered
for
the
thousandth
time
since
lawrence
disavows
any
connection
with
the
in
this
interview
i
can
only
remark
that
events
followed
exactly
in
the
order
he
outlined
that
is
the
istration
attempted
to
satisfy
the
women
by
putting
the
amendment
through
the
house
and
not
through
the
senate
it
was
during
miss
paul
imprisonment
that
the
women
went
in
protest
to
the
picket
line
and
were
sent
to
the
workhouse
as
narrated
in
the
previous
chapter
the
terrorism
they
endured
at
occoquan
ran
simultaneously
with
the
attempted
intimidation
of
miss
paul
and
her
group
in
the
jail
chapter
administration
lawlessness
exposed
in
august
when
it
was
clear
that
the
policy
of
imprisoning
suffragists
would
be
continued
indefinitely
and
under
longer
sentences
the
next
three
groups
of
pickets
to
be
arrested
asked
for
a
decision
from
the
highest
court
the
district
court
of
appeals
unlike
other
police
courts
in
the
country
there
is
no
absolute
right
of
the
police
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
justice
robb
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
after
granting
two
appeals
refused
to
grant
any
more
upon
the
ground
that
he
had
discretionary
power
to
grant
or
withhold
an
appeal
when
further
right
of
appeal
was
denied
us
and
when
the
administration
persisted
in
arresting
us
we
were
compelled
either
to
stop
picketing
or
go
to
prison
the
first
appealed
case
was
heard
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
january
and
the
decision
handed
down
in
favor
of
the
defendants
on
march
this
decision
was
concurred
in
by
all
three
judges
one
of
whom
was
appointed
by
president
wilson
a
second
by
president
roosevelt
and
the
third
by
president
taft
in
effect
the
decision
declared
that
every
one
of
the
suffragists
arrested
up
to
that
time
was
illegally
arrested
illegally
convicted
and
illegally
imprisoned
the
whole
policy
of
the
administration
in
arresting
women
was
by
this
decision
held
up
to
the
world
as
lawless
the
women
could
if
they
had
chosen
have
filed
suits
for
damages
for
false
arrest
and
imprisonment
at
once

stricken
from

dudley
field
malone
was
chief
counsel
in
the
appeal
another
example
of
ethical
if
not
legal
lawlessness
was
shown
by
the
administration
in
the
following
incident
throughout
the
summer
and
early
autumn
we
had
continued
to
press
for
an
investigation
of
conditions
at
occoquan

almost
four
months
earlier

was
the
date
finally
set
for
an
investigation
to
be
held
in

both
of
alexandria
virginia
acting
as
counsel
with
malone
appeared
before
the
board
on
the
opening
day
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
present
their
evidence
they
were
told
by
the
board
conducting
the
investigation
that
this
was
merely
an
inquiry
into
the
workhouse
conditions
and
therefore
would
be
held
in
secret
without
reporters
or
outsiders
present
the
attorneys
demanded
a
public
hearing
and
insisted
that
the
question
was
of
such
momentous
importance
that
the
public
was
entitled
to
hear
both
sides
of
it
they
were
told
they
might
submit
in
writing
any
evidence
they
wished
to
bring
before
the

they
refused
to
produce
testimony
for
a

examine
all

so

we
are
confident
your

will
see
the
justice
and
wisdom
of
a
public
inquiry
if

entitled
to
public
vindication

publicly
know
what
kind
of
a
prison
they
have
in
their

publicly
know
the
frightful

we
are
ready
with
our

affidavits
to
aid
your

subsequently
the
district
board
of

reported
findings
on
their
secret
investigation
after
a
lengthy
preamble
in
which
they
attempted
to
put
the
entire
blame
upon
the
suffrage
prisoners
they
advised
that
the
investigation
directed
by
the
commissioners
of
the

conditions
of
unrest
excitement

stated

after
most
careful
consideration
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
workhouse
at
occoquan

an
institution
of
which
the
commissioners
are
proud
and

source
of
pride

they
may

haggard

came
to

were
able

was
necessary
to
handcuff
miss
burns
to
the
bars
of
her
cell
we
consider
her
well
enough
to
appear
declared
we
consider
we
ought
to
know
what
has
happened
to
all
of
these
petitioners
since
these
events
while
i
was
at
occoquan
sunday
endeavoring
to
see
my
clients
whittaker
was
trying
to
induce
the
ladies
who
he
says
are
too
sick
to
be
brought
here
to
dismiss
this
proceeding
failing
in
that
he
refused
to
let
me
see
them
though
i
had
an
order
from
judge
mullowny
and
they
were
taken
back
to
the
district
of
columbia
from
that
time
to
this
though
i
had
your
honor
order
which
you
signed
in
norfolk
the
superintendent
of
the
washington
jail
also
refused
to
allow
me
to
see
my
clients
saying
that
your
order
had
no
effect
in
the
district
of
columbia
if
there
are
any
petitioners
that
you
claim
have
not
been
brought
here
because
they
have
been
carried
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
i
think
we
should
know
it
ruled
the
court
counsel
for
these
ladies
want
them
here
and
they
say
that
they
ought
to
be
here
and
are
well
enough
to
b
here
that
the
respondent
here
has
spirited
them
away
and
put
them
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
on
that
showing
unless
there
is
some
reason
why
they
ought
not
to
come
they
should
be
here
miss
burns
and
lewes
were
accordingly
ordered
brought
to
court
this
preliminary
skirmish
over
the
opening
discussion
revolved
about
a
point
of
law
as
to
whether
the
virginia
district
court
had
authority
to
act
in
this
case
after
hearing
both
sides
on
this
point
judge
waddill
said
these
are
not
state
prisoners
they
are
prisoners
of
the
district
of
columbia
they
are
held
by
an
order
of
the
court
claiming
to
have
jurisdiction
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
they
are
imprisoned
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
in
occoquan
workhouse
which
very
much
to
our
regret
is
down
here
and
is
an
institution
that
we
alone
have
jurisdiction
over
no
court
would
fail
to
act
when
such
a
state
of
affairs
as
is
set
forth
in
this
petition
is
brought
to
its
attention
here
was
a
case
concerning
or
thirty
ladies
the
statement
as
to
their
treatment
was
bloodcurdling
it
was
shocking
to
man
ideas
of
humanity
if
it
is
true
they
are
here
in
court
and
yet
your
answer
denies
all
these
facts
which
they
submit
it
is
a
question
whether
you
can
do
that
anal
yet
deny
these
petitioners
the
right
of
testimony
proceeding
with
this
argument
the
defense
contended
that
the
act
itself
of
the
district
commissioners
in
sending
prisoners
to
the
occoquan
workhouse
was
illegal
that
no
formal
transfer
from
one
institution
to
another
had
ever
been
made
the
sentencing
papers
distinctly
stating
that
all
prisoners
were
committed
to
the
washington
asylum
and
jail
we
deny
that
the
records
of
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia
can
show
that
there
was
any
order
made
by
the
board
for
the
removal
of
these
women
the
liberty
of
a
citizen
can
not
be
so
disregarded
and
trifled
with
that
any
police
official
or
jailer
may
at
his
own
volition
commit
and
hold
him
in
custody
and
compel
him
to
work
the
liberty
of
the
people
depends
upon
a
broader
foundation
repeated
questions
brought
out
from
zinkhan
warden
of
the
jail
the
fact
that
the
directions
given
by
the
commissioners
to
transfer
prisoners
from
the
jail
to
occoquan
rested
entirely
upon
a
verbal
order
given
five
or
six
years
ago
do
you
really
mean
interrupted
the
court
that
the
only
authority
you
have
on
the
part
of
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
transfer
parties
down
to
occoquan
is
a
verbal
order
made
five
or
six
years
ago
questions
by
the
defense
brought
out
the
fact
also
that
zinkhan
could
remember
in
detail
the
first
oral
orders
he
had
received
for
such
a
transfer
dating
back
to
although
he
could
not
remember
important
details
as
to
how
he
had
received
the
orders
concerning
the
suffragists
committed
to
his
care
he
only
knew
that
orders
were
oral
and
explicit
q
by
defense
in
court
you
say
the
three
commissioners
were
present
a
sure
q
who
else
was
present
i
am
not
sure
just
now
who
else
was
present
i
remember
somebody
else
was
there
but
i
do
remember
just
who
q
were
the
three
commissioners
present
at
the
time
commissioner
brownlow
gave
you
this
order
a
yes
q
you
say
it
was
a
verbal
order
of
the
commissioners
a
yes
q
was
the
clerk
of
the
board
present
i
think
not
q
and
you
can
not
remember
who
was
present
aside
from
the
three
commissioners
a
no
i
can
not
remember
just
now
q
try
to
recollect
who
was
present
at
that
meeting
when
this
order
was
given
aside
from
the
commissioners
there
was
somebody
else
present
a
it
is
my
impression
that
there
was
some
one
other
person
present
but
i
am
not
sure
just
now
who
it
was
q
it
was
some
official
some
one
well
known
was
it
not
i
am
not
sure
this
conference
was
one
in
which
mcadoo
was
reported
to
have
participated
the
gentle
judge
was
distressed
when
in
answer
to
a
question
by
the
government
attorney
as
to
what
zinkhan
did
when
the
prisoners
were
given
into
his
charge
the
warden
replied
i
heard
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
sentence
and
i
did
not
get
away
from
the
commissioners
meeting
until
nearly
and
i
jumped
in
my
machine
and
went
down
to
the
jail
and
i
think
at
that
time
six
of
them
had
been
delivered
there
and
were
in
the
rotunda
of
the
jail
and
a
few
minutes
after
that
a
van
load
came
the
remaining
number
of
ten
or
twelve
had
not
arrived
but
inasmuch
as
the
train
had
to
leave
at
and
there
would
not
be
time
enough
to
receive
them
in
the
jail
and
get
them
there
in
time
for
the
train
i
took
the
van
that
was
there
right
over
to
the
east
end
of
the
union
station
and
i
think
i
took
some
of
the
others
in
my
machine
and
another
machine
we
had
there
carried
some
of
the
others
over
and
we
telephoned
the
other
van
at
police
court
to
go
direct
to
the
east
end
of
the
union
station
and
to
deliver
them
to
me
i
had
of
course
the
commitments
of
those
that
were
brought
up
to
the
of
received
from
the
officer
of
the
court
the
other
commitments
of
the
last
van
load
and
there
i
turned
all
of
them
except
one
that
i
kept
back
over
to
the
receiving
and
discharging
officer
representing
the
district
workhouse
and
they
were
taken
down
there
that
evening
there
followed
some
questioning
of
the
uneasy
warden
as
to
how
he
used
this
power
to
decide
which
prisoners
should
remain
in
jail
and
which
should
be
sent
to
occoquan
warden
zinkhan
stuttered
something
about
sending
all
the
able
bodied
prisoners
to
able
to
perform
useful
work
that
humanitarian
motives
usually
guided
him
in
his
selection
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
the
warden
for
he
had
to
conceal
just
why
the
suffrage
prisoners
were
sent
to
occoquan
and
in
so
doing
had
to
invent
motives
of
his
own
q
by
defense
zinkhan
were
you
or
were
you
not
actuated
by
humanitarian
motives
when
you
sent
this
group
of
women
to
the
occoquan
workhouse
a
yes
q
were
you
actuated
by
humanitarian
motives
when
you
sent
nolan
a
woman
of
years
to
the
workhouse
did
you
think
that
she
could
perform
some
service
at
occoquan
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
her
out
of
district
jail
and
go
down
there
warden
zinkhan
gazed
at
the
ceiling
shifted
in
his
chair
and
hesitated
to
answer
the
question
was
repeated
and
finally
the
warden
admitted
uncomfortably
that
he
believed
he
was
inspired
by
humanitarian
motives
nolan
will
you
please
stand
up
called
out
malone
all
eyes
turned
toward
the
front
row
where
nolan
slowly
got
to
her
feet
the
tiny
figure
of
a
woman
with
pale
face
and
snowy
hair
standing
out
dramatically
against
her
black
bonnet
and
plain
black
dress
was
answer
enough
warden
zinkhan
answers
after
that
came
even
more
haltingly
he
seemed
inordinately
fearful
of
trapping
himself
by
his
own
words
the
testimony
has
brought
out
the
fact
the
judge
remarked
at
this
point
that
two
of
these
ladies
were
old
and
one
of
them
is
a
delicate
lady
her
appearance
would
indicate
that
she
is
not
strong
under
this
rule
if
one
of
these
ladies
had
been
eighty
years
old
and
unable
to
walk
she
would
have
gone
along
with
the
herd
and
nobody
would
have
dared
to
say
this
to
be
done
would
the
commissioners
in
a
case
of
that
sort
if
they
gave
consideration
to
it
think
of
sending
such
an
individual
there
was
not
that
what
the
law
expected
them
to
do
and
not
take
them
off
in
droves
and
inspect
them
at
the
union
station
and
shoot
them
on
down
yet
that
is
about
what
was
done
in
this
case
in
summing
up
this
phase
of
the
case
in
an
eloquent
appeal
malone
said
can
the
commissioners
with
caprice
and
no
order
and
no
record
except
that
orally
given
five
or
six
years
ago
and
one
which
this
warden
now
says
was
given
and
explicit
transfer
defendants
placed
in
a
particular
institution
and
under
a
particular
kind
of
punishment
arbitrarily
to
another
institution
and
add
to
their
punishment
even
if
we
admit
that
the
commissioners
had
power
did
congress
ever
contemplate
that
any
district
commissioners
would
dare
to
exercise
power
affecting
the
life
and
health
of
defendants
in
this
fashion
did
congress
ever
contemplate
that
by
mere
whim
these
things
could
be
done
i
am
sure
it
did
not
and
even
on
the
admission
of
the
government
that
they
had
the
power
they
have
exercised
this
power
in
such
a
scandalous
fashion
that
it
is
worthy
of
the
notice
of
the
court
and
worthy
of
the
remedy
which
we
removal
of
the
suffrage
prisoners
from
the
occoquan
workhouse
after
a
brief
recess
judge
waddill
rendered
this
decision
the
locking
up
of
thirty
human
beings
is
an
unusual
sort
of
thing
and
judicial
officers
ought
to
be
required
to
stop
long
enough
to
see
whether
some
prisoners
ought
to
go
and
some
not
whether
some
might
not
be
killed
by
going
or
whether
they
should
go
dead
or
alive
this
class
o
f
prisoners
and
this
number
of
prisoners
should
haze
been
given
special
consideration
there
can
not
be
any
controversy
about
this
question
you
ought
to
lawfully
lock
them
up
instead
of
unlawfully
locking
them
they
are
to
be
locked
up
the
petitioners
are
therefore
one
and
all
in
the
workhouse
semblance
of
authority
or
legal
process
of
any
kind
and
they
will
accordingly
be
remanded
to
the
custody
of
the
superintendent
of
the
washington
asylum
and
jail
it
having
been
decided
that
the
prisoners
were
illegally
detained
in
the
workhouse
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
into
a
discussion
of
the
cruelties
committed
upon
the
prisoners
while
there
the
government
attorneys
immediately
announced
that
they
would
appeal
from
the
decision
of
judge
waddill
pending
such
an
appeal
the
women
were
at
liberty
to
be
paroled
in
the
custody
of
counsel
but
since
they
had
come
from
the
far
corners
of
the
continent
and
since
some
of
them
had
served
out
almost
half
of
their
sentence
and
did
not
wish
in
case
of
an
adverse
decision
on
the
appeal
to
have
to
return
later
to
undergo
the
rest
of
their
sentence
they
preferred
to
finish
their
sentences
these
were
the
workhouse
prisoners
thus
remanded
to
the
jail
who
continued
the
hunger
strike
undertaken
at
the
workhouse
and
made
a
redoubtable
reinforcement
to
alice
paul
and
rose
winslow
and
their
comrades
strike
in
the
jail
when
the
former
arrived
chapter
the
administration
outwitted
with
thirty
determined
women
on
hunger
strike
of
whom
eight
were
in
a
state
of
almost
total
collapse
the
administration
capitulated
it
could
not
afford
to
feed
thirty
women
forcibly
and
risk
the
social
and
political
consequences
nor
could
it
let
thirty
women
starve
themselves
to
death
and
likewise
take
the
consequences
for
by
this
time
one
thing
was
clear
and
that
was
that
the
discipline
and
endurance
of
the
women
could
not
be
broken
and
so
all
the
prisoners
were
unconditionally
released
on
november
and
november
on
leaving
prison
miss
paul
said
the
commutation
of
sentences
acknowledges
them
to
be
unjust
and
arbitrary
the
attempt
to
suppress
legitimate
propaganda
has
failed
we
hope
that
no
more
demonstrations
will
be
necessary
that
the
amendment
will
move
steadily
on
to
passage
and
ratification
without
further
suffering
or
sacrifice
but
what
we
do
depends
entirely
upon
what
the
administration
does
we
have
one
aim
the
immediate
passage
of
the
federal
amendment
running
parallel
to
the
protest
made
inside
the
prison
a
public
protest
of
proportions
had
been
made
against
continuing
to
imprison
women
deputations
of
fluential
women
had
waited
upon
all
party
leaders
cabinet
officials
heads
of
the
war
boards
in
fact
every
friend
of
the
administration
pointing
out
that
we
had
broken
no
law
that
we
were
unjustly
held
and
that
administration
would
suffer
politically
for
their
handling
of
the
suffrage
agitation
a
committee
of
women
after
some
lively
fencing
with
the
secretary
of
war
finally
drove
baker
to
admit
that
women
had
been
sent
to
prison
for
a
political
principle
that
they
were
not
petty
disturbers
but
part
of
a
great
fundamental
struggle
secretary
baker
said
this
the
suffrage
struggle
is
a
revolution
there
have
been
revolutions
all
through
tory
some
have
been
justified
and
some
have
not
the
burden
of
responsibility
to
decide
whether
your
revolution
is
justified
or
not
is
on
you
the
whole
philosophy
of
your
movement
seems
to
be
to
obey
no
laws
until
you
have
a
voice
in
those
laws
at
least
one
member
of
the
cabinet
thus
showed
that
he
had
caught
something
of
the
purpose
and
depth
of
our
movement
he
never
publicly
protested
however
against
the
administration
policy
of
suppression
mcadoo
then
secretary
of
the
treasury
gave
no
such
evidence
of
enlightenment
as
baker
a
committee
of
women
endeavored
to
see
him
he
was
reported
out
but
we
expect
him
here
soon
we
waited
an
hour
the
nervous
private
secretary
returned
to
say
that
he
had
been
mistaken
the
secretary
will
not
be
in
until
after
luncheon
we
shall
wait
said
william
kent
chairman
of
the
deputation
we
have
nothing
more
important
to
do
than
to
see
secretary
mcadoo
we
are
willing
to
wait
the
whole
day
if
necessary
only
it
is
imperative
that
we
see
him
the
private
secretary
spirits
sank
he
looked
as
if
he
would
give
anything
to
undo
his
inadvertence
in
telling
us
that
the
secretary
was
expected
after
luncheon
poor
man
we
settled
down
comfortably
to
wait
a
formidable
looking
committee
of
twenty
women
there
was
the
customary
gentle
embarrassment
of
ants
whose
chief
is
in
a
predicament
from
which
they
seem
powerless
to
extricate
him
but
all
were
extremely
courteous
the
attendant
at
the
door
brought
us
the
morning
papers
to
read
gradually
groups
of
men
began
to
arrive
and
cards
were
sent
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
we
inferred
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
safely
hidden
hoping
and
praying
for
our
early
retirement
whispered
conversations
were
held
men
disappeared
in
and
out
of
strange
doors
still
we
waited
finally
as
the
fourth
hour
of
our
vigil
was
dragging
on
a
lieutenant
appeared
to
announce
that
the
secretary
was
very
sorry
but
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
see
us
at
all
we
consulted
and
finally
sent
in
a
written
appeal
asking
for
five
minutes
of
his
precious
time
on
a
matter
of
grave
importance
more
waiting
finally
a
letter
was
brought
to
us
directed
to
william
kent
with
the
ink
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
signature
still
wet
with
no
concealment
of
contempt
he
declared
that
under
no
circumstances
could
he
speak
with
women
who
had
conducted
such
an
outrageous
campaign
in
such
an
illegal
way
we
smiled
as
we
learned
from
his
pronouncement
that
picketing
was
illegal
for
we
were
not
supposed
to
have
been
arrested
for
picketing
the
tone
of
his
letter
its
extreme
bitterness
tended
to
confirm
what
we
had
always
been
told
that
mcadoo
assisted
in
directing
the
policy
of
arrests
and
imprisonment
i
have
tried
to
secure
this
letter
for
reproduction
but
unfortunately
kent
did
not
save
it
we
all
remember
its
bitter
passion
however
and
the
point
it
made
about
our
illegal
picketing
congress
convened
on
december
president
wilson
delivered
a
message
restating
our
aims
in
the
war
he
also
recommended
a
declaration
of
a
state
of
war
against
austria
the
control
of
certain
water
power
sites
export
railway
legislation
and
the
speeding
up
of
all
sary
appropriation
legislation
but
he
did
not
mention
the
suffrage
amendment
having
been
forced
to
release
the
prisoners
he
again
rested
immediately
we
called
a
conference
in
washington
of
the
executive
committee
and
the
national
advisory
council
of
the
woman
party
past
activities
were
briefly
reviewed
and
the
political
situation
discussed
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
treasurer
report
made
at
this
conference
showed
that
receipts
in
some
months
during
the
picketing
had
been
double
what
they
were
the
same
month
the
previous
year
when
there
was
no
picketing
in
one
month
of
picketing
the
receipts
went
as
high
as
six
times
the
normal
amount
for
example
in
july
of
when
the
arrests
had
just
begun
receipts
for
the
month
totalled
as
against
for
july
of
in
november
when
the
militant
situation
was
at
its
highest
point
there
was
received
at
national
headquarters
as
against
received
in
november
still
there
were
those
who
said
we
had
no
friends
a
rumor
that
the
president
would
act
persisted
but
we
could
not
rely
on
rumor
we
decided
to
accelerate
him
and
his
administration
by
filing
damage
suits
amounting
to
against
the
district
commissioners
against
warden
zinkhan
against
superintendent
whittaker
and
captain
reams
a
workhouse
guard
they
were
brought
in
no
spirit
of
revenge
but
merely
that
the
administration
should
not
be
allowed
to
forget
its
record
of
brutality
unless
it
chose
to
amend
its
conduct
by
passing
the
amendment
the
suits
were
brought
by
the
women
woo
suffered
the
greatest
abuse
during
the
night
of
terror
at
the
workhouse
if
any
one
is
still
in
doubt
as
to
the
close
relation
between
the
court
procedure
in
our
case
and
the
president
actions
we
were
obliged
to
bring
the
suits
against
individuals
as
we
could
not
in
the
law
bring
them
against
the
government
this
letter
to
one
of
our
attorneys
in
january
must
convince
him
my
dear
i
wish
you
would
advise
me
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
what
will
be
done
with
the
suffragist
cases
now
pending
against
whittaker
and
reams
in
the
united
states
district
court
at
alexandria
i
have
heard
rumors
the
truth
of
which
you
will
understand
better
than
i
that
these
cases
will
be
dropped
if
the
president
comes
out
in
favor
of
woman
suffrage
this
i
understand
he
will
do
and
certainly
hope
so
as
i
am
personally
in
favor
of
it
and
have
been
for
many
years
but
in
case
of
his
delay
in
taking
any
action
will
you
agree
to
continue
these
cases
for
the
present
very
truly
yours

the

when
the
storm
had
subsided
quietly
removed

and

resigned

at
the

presumably
under
pressure
from

the

party
conference
came
to
a
dramatic
close
during
that
first
week
in
december
with
an
enormous
mass
meeting
in
the
belasco
theatre
in
washington
on
that
quiet
sunday
afternoon
as
the
president
came
through
his
gates
for
his
afternoon
drive
a
passageway
had
to
be
opened
for
his

car
through
the
crowd
of
four
thousand
people
who
were
blocking
madison
place
in
an
effort
to
get
inside
the
belasco
theatre
inside
the
building
was
packed
to
the
rafters
the
president
saw
squads
of
police
reserves
who
had
been
for
the
past
six
months
arresting
pickets
for
him
battling
with
a
crowd
that
was
literally
storming
the
theatre
in
their
eagerness
to
do
honor
to
those
who
had
been
arrested
inside
there
was
a
fever
heat
of
enthusiasm
bursting
cheers
and
thundering
applause
which
shook
the
building
america
has
never
before
nor
since
seen
such
a
suffrage
meeting
belmont
chairman
opened
the
meeting
by
saying
we
are
here
this
afternoon
to
do
honor
to
a
hundred
gallant
women
who
have
endured
the
hardship
and
humiliation
of
imprisonment
because
they
love
liberty
the
suffrage
pickets
stood
at
the
white
house
gates
for
ten
months
and
dramatized
the
women
agitation
for
political
liberty
and
patriotic
american
women
will
no
longer
tolerate
a
government
which
denies
women
the
right
to
govern
themselves
a
flame
of
rebellion
is
abroad
among
women
and
the
stupidity
and
brutality
of
the
government
in
this
revolt
have
only
served
to
increase
its
heat
as
president
wilson
wrote
have
been
very
successful
in
parrying
agitation
diverting
it
in
seeming
to
yield
to
it
and
then
cheating
it
tiring
it
out
or
evading
it
but
the
end
whether
it
comes
soon
or
late
is
quite
certain
to
be
the
same
while
the
government
has
endeavored
to
parry
tire
divert
and
cheat
us
of
our
goal
the
country
has
risen
in
protest
against
this
evasive
policy
of
suppression
until
the
indomitable
pickets
with
their
historic
legends
stand
triumphant
before
the
nation

had
led

were
willing

go

uproar

immediately
following
the
release
of
the
prisoners
and
the
magnificent
demonstration
of
public
support
of
them
culminating
at
the
mass
meeting
recorded
in
the
preceding
chapter
political
events
happened
thick
and
fast
committees
in
congress
acted
on
the
amendment
president
wilson
surrendered
and
a
date
for
the
vote
was
set
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
voted
to
to
report
the
amendment
to
that
body
the
measure
it
will
be
remembered
was
reported
to
the
senate
in
the
closing
days
of
the
previous
session
and
was
therefore
already
before
the
senate
awaiting
action
to
be
sure
the
judiciary
committee
voted
to
report
the
amendment
without
recommendation
but
soon
after
the
members
of
the
suffrage
committee
provision
for
which
had
also
been
made
during
the
war
session
were
appointed
all
but
four
members
of
this
committee
were
in
favor
of
national
suffrage
and
immediately
after
its
formation
it
met
to
organize
and
decided
to
take
the
suffrage
measure
out
of
the
hands
of
the
judiciary
committee
and
to
press
for
a
vote
a
test
of
strength
came
on
december
on
a
trivial
motion
to
refer
all
suffrage
bills
to
the
new
suffrage
committee
the
vote
stood
to
this
vote
although
unimportant
in
itself
clearly
promised
victory
for
the
amendment
in
the
house
in
a
few
days
representative
see
chapter
dell
of
wyoming
republican
declared
that
the
republican
side
of
the
house
would
give
more
than
a
majority
of
its
members
to
the
amendment
it
is
up
to
our
friends
on
the
democratic
side
to
see
that
the
amendment
is
not
defeated
through
hostility
or
indifference
on
their
side
said
mondell
our
daily
poll
of
the
house
showed
constant
gains
pledges
from
both
democratic
and
republican
members
came
thick
and
fast
cabinet
members
for
the
first
time
publicly
declared
their
belief
in
the
amendment
a
final
poll
however
showed
that
we
lacked
a
few
votes
of
the
necessary
majority
to
pass
the
measure
in
the
house
no
stone
was
left
unturned
in
a
final
effort
to
get
the
president
to
secure
additional
democratic
votes
to
insure
the
passage
of
the
amendment
finally
on
the
eve
of
the
vote
president
wilson
made
his
first
declaration
of
support
of
the
amendment
through
a
committee
of
democratic
congressmen
during
the
vote
the
following
day
representative
cantrill
of
kentucky
democrat
reported
the
event
to
the
house
he
said
in
part
it
was
my
privilege
yesterday
afternoon
to
be
one
of
a
committee
of
twelve
to
ask
the
president
for
advice
and
counsel
on
this
important
measure
prolonged
laughter
and
jeers
speaker
in
answer
to
the
sentiment
expressed
by
part
of
the
house
i
desire
to
say
that
at
no
time
and
upon
no
occasion
am
i
ever
ashamed
to
confer
with
woodrow
wilson
upon
any
important
question
laughter
applause
and
jeers
and
that
part
of
the
house
that
has
jeered
that
statement
before
it
adjourns
will
follow
absolutely
the
advice
which
he
gave
this
committee
yesterday
afternoon
laughter
and
applause
after
conference
with
the
president
yesterday
afternoon
he
wrote
with
his
own
hands
the
words
which
i
now
read
to
you
and
each
member
of
the
committee
was
authorized
by
the
president
to
give
full
publicity
to
the
following
the
committee
found
that
the
president
had
not
felt
at
liberty
to
volunteer
his
advice
to
members
of
congress
in
this
important
matter
but
when
we
sought
his
advice
laughter
he
very
frankly
and
earnestly
advised
us
to
vote
for
the
amendment
as
an
act
of
right
and
justice
to
the
women
of
the
country
and
o
f
the
world
to
my
democratic
brethren
who
have
made
these
halls
ring
with
their
eloquence
in
their
pleas
to
stand
by
the
president
i
will
say
that
now
is
your
chance
to
stand
by
the
president
and
vote
for
this
amendment
as
an
act
of
right
and
justice
to
the
women
of
the
country
and
of
the
world
do
you
wish
to
do
that
which
is
right
and
just
toward
the
women
of
your
own
country
if
so
follow
the
president
advice
and
vote
for
this
amendment
it
will
not
do
to
follow
the
president
in
this
great
crisis
in
the
world
history
on
those
matters
only
which
are
popular
in
your
own
districts
the
true
test
is
to
stand
by
him
even
though
your
own
vote
is
unpopular
at
home
the
acid
test
for
a
member
of
congress
is
for
him
to
stand
for
right
and
justice
even
if
misunderstood
at
home
at
first
in
the
end
right
and
justice
will
prevail
everywhere
no
one
thing
connected
with
the
war
is
of
more
importance
at
this
time
than
meeting
the
reasonable
demand
of
millions
of
patriotic
and
christian
women
of
the
nation
that
the
amendment
for
woman
suffrage
be
submitted
to
the
states
the
amendment
passed
the
house
january
by
a
vote
of
to
majority
with
one
vote
to
forty
years
to
a
day
from
the
time
the
suffrage
amendment
was
first
introduced
into
congress
and
exactly
one
year
to
a
day
from
the
time
the
first
picket
banner
appeared
at
the
gates
o
f
the
white
house
per
cent
of
the
republicans
voting
on
the
measure
voted
in
favor
of
it
while
only
fifty
per
cent
of
the
democrats
voting
voted
for
it
even
after
the
republicans
had
pledged
their
utmost
strength
more
than
of
their
membership
votes
were
still
lacking
to
make
up
the
democratic
deficiency
and
the
president
declaration
that
the
measure
ought
to
pass
the
house
produced
them
from
his
own
party
those
who
contend
that
picketing
had
set
back
the
clock
it
did
no
good
president
wilson
would
not
be
moved
by
it
we
believe
the
burden
of
proof
on
their
side
of
the
argument
it
is
our
firm
belief
that
the
solid
year
of
picketing
with
all
its
political
ramifications
did
compel
the
president
to
abandon
his
opposition
and
declare
himself
for
the
measure
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
many
things
do
not
cooperate
in
a
movement
toward
a
great
event
i
do
mean
to
say
that
picketing
was
the
most
vital
force
amongst
the
elements
which
moved
president
wilson
that
picketing
had
compelled
congress
to
see
the
question
in
terms
of
political
capital
is
also
true
from
the
first
word
uttered
in
the
house
debate
until
the
final
political
expediency
was
the
chief
motif
lenroot
of
wisconsin
republican
rose
to
say
may
i
suggest
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
democratic
members
of
the
committee
on
rules
and
the
republican
members
in
this
that
all
of
the
republican
members
are
for
this
proposition
this
was
met
with
instant
applause
from
the
republican
side
representative
cantrill
prefaced
his
speech
embodying
the
president
statement
which
caused
roars
and
jeers
from
the
opposition
with
the
announcement
that
he
was
not
willing
to
risk
another
election
with
the
voting
women
of
the
west
and
the
amendment
still
unpassed
lenroot
further
pointed
out
that
from
a
republican
a
partisan
standpoint
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
republicans
to
go
before
the
people
in
the
next
election
and
say
that
this
resolution
was
defeated
by
southern
democrats
an
tried
above
the
din
and
noise
to
remind
lenroot
that
three
years
before
lenroot
had
voted
no
but
a
republican
colleague
came
suddenly
to
the
rescue
with
what
about
mr
wilson
which
was
followed
by
he
kept
us
out
of
war
and
the
jeers
on
the
republican
side
became
more
pronounced
this
interesting
political
tilt
took
place
when
representatives
dennison
and
williams
of
illinois
and
representative
kearns
of
ohio
republicans
fenced
with
representative
raker
of
california
democrat
as
he
attempted
with
an
evident
note
of
to
make
the
president
reversal
seem
less
sudden
dennison
it
was
known
by
the
committee
that
went
to
see
the
president
that
the
republicans
were
going
to
take
this
matter
up
and
pass
it
in
caucus
was
it
not
raker
i
want
to
say
to
my
republican
friends
upon
this
question
that
i
have
been
in
conference
with
the
president
for
over
three
years
upon
this
question
kearns
how
did
the
women
of
california
find
out
and
learn
where
the
president
stood
on
this
thing
just
before
election
last
fall
nobody
else
seemed
to
know
it
raker
they
knew
it
kearns
how
did
they
find
it
out
raker
i
will
take
a
minute
or
two
kearns
i
wish
the
gentleman
would
raker
the
president
went
home
and
registered
the
president
went
home
and
voted
for
woman
suffrage
kearns
he
said
he
believed
in
it
for
the
several
states
raker
one
kearns
that
is
the
only
information
they
had
upon
the
subject
is
it
williams
will
the
gentleman
yield
raker
i
can
not
yield
williams
just
for
a
question
raker
i
can
not
yield
that
the
president
political
speed
left
some
overcome
was
clear
from
a
remark
of
clark
of
florida
when
he
said
i
was
amused
at
my
friend
from
oklahoma
ferris
who
wants
us
to
stand
with
the
president
god
knows
i
want
to
stand
with
him
i
am
a
democrat
and
i
want
to
follow
the
leader
of
my
party
and
i
am
a
pretty
good
lightning
change
artist
myself
sometimes
laughter
but
god
knows
i
can
not
keep
up
with
his
performance
laughter
why
the
president
wrote
a
book
away
back
yonder
and
he
quoted
generously
from
president
wilson
many
statements
in
defense
of
state
rights
as
recorded
in
his
early
writings
hersey
of
maine
republican
drew
applause
when
he
made
a
retort
to
the
democratic
slogan
stand
by
the
president
he
said
speaker
i
am
still
with
the
president
or
in
other
words
the
president
this
morning
is
standing
with
me
the
resentment
at
having

throughout
the
debate
representative
gordon
of
ohio
democrat
said
with
bitter
ness
we
are
threatened
by
these
militant
suffragettes
with
a
direct
and
lawless
invasion
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
of
the
rights
of
those
states
which
have
refused
to
confer
upon
their
women
the
privilege
of
voting
this
attitude
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
suffrage
members
of
this
house
is
on
an
exact
equality
with
the
acts
of
these
women
militants
who
have
spent
the
last
summer
and
fall
while
they
were
not
in
the
district
jail
or
workhouse
in
coaxing
teasing
and
nagging
the
presi
dent
of
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
him
by
coercion
to
club
congress
into
adopting
this
joint
resolution
shouts
of
well
they
got
him

they
got
it

sides

by
prolonged
laughter
and
jeers

oratory
ferris

democrat
hoped
to
minimize
the
effectiveness
of
the
picket
speaker
he
said
i
do
not
approve
or
believe
in
picketing
the
white
house
the
national
capitol
or
any
other
station
to
bring
about
votes
for
women
i
do
not
approve
of
wild
militancy
hunger
strikes
and
efforts
of
that
sort
i
do
not
approve
of
the
course
of
those
women
that
become
agitators
lay
off
their
womanly
qualities
in
their
efforts
to
secure
votes
i
do
not
approve
of
anything
unwomanly
anywhere
any
time
and
my
course
in
supporting
this
suffrage
amendment
is
not
guided
by
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
very
few
women
here
or
elsewhere
applause
representative
langley
of
kentucky
republican
was
able
to
see
picketing
in
a
fairer
light
much
has
been
said
pro
and
con
about
rather
dramatic
chapter
in
the
history
of
this
great
movement
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
speak
either
in
criticism
or
condemnation
of
that
but
if
it
be
do
not
say
that
it
is
because
i
do
not
but
if
it
be
true
as
has
been
alleged
that
certain
promises
were
made
as
a
result
of
which
a
great
campaign
was
won
and
those
promises
were
not
kept
i
wonder
whether
in
that
silent
peaceful
protest
that
was
against
this
broken
faith
there
can
be
found
sufficient
warrant
for
the
indignities
which
the
suffered
and
when
in
passing
up
and
down
the
avenue
i
frequently
witnessed
cultured
intellectual
women
arrested
and
dragged
off
to
prison
because
of
their
method
of
giving
publicity
to
what
they
believed
to
be
the
truth
i
will
confess
that
the
question
sometimes
arose
in
my
mind
whether
when
the
impartial
history
of
this
great
struggle
has
been
written
their
names
may
not
be
placed
upon
the
roll
of
martyrs
to
the
cause
to
which
they
were
consecrating
their
lives
in
the
manner
that
they
deemed
most
effective
mays
of
utah
was
one
democrat
who
placed
the
responsibility
for
militancy
where
it
rightly
belonged
when
he
said
some
say
that
they
are
ashamed
of
the
action
of
the
militants
in
picketing
the
capitol
but
we
should
be
more
ashamed
of
the
unreasonable
stubbornness
on
the
part
of
the
men
who
refused
them
the
justice
they
have
so
long
and
patiently
asked
and
so
the
debate
ran
on
occasionally
one
caught
a
glimmer
of
real
comprehension
amongst
these
men
about
to
vote
upon
our
political
liberty
but
more
often
the
discussion
stayed
on
a
very
inferior
level
and
there
were
gems
imperishable
even
friends
of
the
measure
had
difficulty
not
to
romanticize
about

then
just

endure
just
so
long
as
its
men
are

history
physiology
and

all
show
that
giving
woman
equal
political
rights
with
man
makes
ultimately
for
the
deterioration
of
manhood
it
is
therefore
not
only
because
i
want
our
country
to
win
this
war
but
because
i
want
our
nation
to
possess
the
male
virility
necessary
to
guarantee
its
future
existence
that
i
am
opposed
to

hope
was
expressed
that

would

that
it

this
calm
statement
could
not

the
terror
of

who
cried
in
the
hearings
before
the
committee
it
will
be
found
that
one
of
the
leaders
among
the
suffragettes
declared
that
they
wanted
the
ballot
for
and
when
asked
against
whom
she
desired
she
promptly
and
frankly
replied
my
god
has
it
come
to
pass
in
america
that
the
women
of
the
land
need
to
be
protected

nodded
their

he
concluded
desperately
with
the
trend
obviously
toward
crowning
the
queens
there
was
the
disturbing
consideration
that
women
know
too
much
to
be
trusted
i
happen
to
have
a
mother
said
gray
of

republican
as
most
of
us
have
and
incidentally
i
think
we
all
have
fathers
although
a
father
does
not
count
for
much
any
more
my
mother
has
forgotten
more
political
history
than
he
ever
knew
and
she
knows
more
about
the
american
government
and
american

economy
than
he
has
ever
shown
symptoms
of
knowing
and
for
the
good

is

the
perennial
lament
for
the
passing

said
the

left

be
sailing
on
an
unknown
and
uncharted
sea
the
government
founded
in
the
blood
of
our
fathers
is
fading
away
last
fall
a
year
ago
both
parties
recognized
those
principles
in
their
platforms
and
each
candidate
solemnly
declared
that
he
would
abide
by
them
if
elected
but
lo
all
old
things
are
passing
away

from

has
filed
a
bill

be
granted

marrying

representative
greene
of
massachusetts
republican
all
but
shed
tears
over
the
inevitable
amending
of
the
constitution
i
have
read
it
the
constitution
many
times
and
there
have
been
just
amendments
adopted
since
the
original
constitution
was
framed
by
the
master
minds
whom
god
had
inspired
in
the
cabin
of
the
mayflower
to
formulate
the
constitution
of
the
plymouth
colony
which
was
made
the
basis
of
the
constitution
of
massachusetts
and
subsequently
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
under
which
we
now
live
fancy
his
shock
at
finding
the
pickets
triumphant
since
the
second
session
of
the
congress
opened
he
said
i
have
met
several
women
suffragists
from
the
state
of
massachusetts
i
have
immediately
propounded
to
them
this
one
question
you
approve
or
disapprove
of
the
suffrage
banners
in
front
of
the
white
house
the
answer
in
nearly
every
case
to
my
question
was
glory
in
that
demonstration
the
response
to
my
question
was
very
offensive
and
i
immediately
ordered
these
suffrage
advocates
from
my
office
and
again
the
pickets
featured
in
the
final
remarks
of
small
of
north
carolina
democrat
who
deplored
the
fact
that
advocates
of
the
amendment
had
made
it
an
issue
inducing
party
rivalry
this
is
no
party
question
and
such
efforts
will
be
futile
it
almost
equals
in
intelligence
the
scheme
of
that
delectable
and
inane
group
of
women
who
picketed
the
white
house
on
the
theory
that
the
president
could
grant
them
the
right
to
vote
amid
such
gems
of
intellectual
delight
the
house
of
the
great
american
congress
passed
the
national
suffrage
amendment
we
turned
our
entire
attention
then
to
the
senate
chapter
an
interlude
seven
months
the
president
had
finally
thrown
his
power
to
putting
the
amendment
through
the
house
we
hoped
he
would
follow
this
up
by
insisting
upon
the
passage
of
the
amendment
in
the
senate
we
ceased
our
acts
of
dramatic
protest
for
the
moment
and
gave
our
energies
to
getting
public
pressure
upon
him
to
persuade
him
to
see
that
the
senate
acted
we
also
continued
to
press
directly
upon
recalcitrant
senators
of
the
minority
party
who
could
be
won
only
through
appeals
other
than
from
the
president
there
are
in
the
senate
elected
from
each
of
the
states
to
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
through
the
senate
votes
are
necessary
a
majority
at
this
point
in
the
campaign
senators
were
pledged
to
support
the
measure
and
were
opposed
we
therefore
had
to
win
more
votes
a
measure
passed
through
one
branch
of
congress
must
be
passed
through
the
other
branch
during
the
life
of
that
congress
otherwise
it
dies
automatically
and
must
be
born
again
in
a
new
congress
we
therefore
had
only
the
remainder
of
the
first
regular
session
of
the
congress
and
failing
of
that
the
short
second
session
from
december
to
march
in
which
to
win
those
votes
backfires
were
started
in
the
states
of
the
senators
not
yet
committed
to
the
amendment
organized
demand
for
action
in
the
senate
grew
to
huge
proportions
we
turned
also
to
the
leading
influential
members
of
the
respective
parties
for
active
help
colonel
roosevelt
did
his
most
effective
suffrage
work
at
this
period
in
a
determined
attack
upon
the
few
unconvinced
republican
senators
the
colonel
was
one
of
the
few
leaders
in
our
national
life
who
was
never
too
busy
to
confer
or
to
offer
and
accept
suggestions
as
to
procedure
he
seemed
to
have
imagination
about
women
he
never
took
a
patronizing
attitude
nor
did
he
with
moral
unction
dogmatically
tell
you
how
the
fight
should
be
waged
and
won
he
presupposed
ability
among
women
leaders
he
was
not
offended
morally
or
politically
by
our
preferring
to
go
to
jail
rather
than
to
submit
in
silence
in
fact
he
was
at
this
time
under
administration
fire
because
of
his
bold
attacks
upon
some
of
their
policies
and
remarked
during
an
interview
at
oyster
bay
i
may
soon
join
you
women
in
jail
one
can
never
tell
these
days
his
sagacious
attitude
toward
conservative
and
radical
suffrage
forces
was
always
delightful
and
indicative
of
his
appreciation
of
the
political
and
social
value
of
a
movement
having
vitality
enough
to
disagree
on
methods
none
of
the
banal
philosophy
that
you
can
never
win
until
all
your
forces
get
together
from
the
colonel
one
day
as
i
came
into
his
office
for
an
interview
i
met
a
member
of
the
conservative
suffragists
just
leaving
and
we
spoke
in
his
office
the
colonel
remarked
you
know
i
contemplated
having
both
you
and
whitney
come
to
see
me
at
the
same
time
since
it
was
on
a
similar
mission
but
i
quite
know
whether
the
lion
and
the
lamb
would
lie
down
together
and
i
thought
i
better
take
no
chances
but
i
see
on
speaking
terms
he
added
i
answered
that
our
relations
were
extremely
amiable
but
remarked
that
the
other
side
might
not
like
to
be
called
lambs
you
delight
in
being
the
that
point
i
am
safe
am
i
not
and
he
smiled
his
widest
smile
as
he
plunged
into
a
vivid
expository
attack
upon
the
senatorial
opponents
of
suffrage
in
his
own
party
he
wrote
letters
to
them
if
this
failed
he
invited
them
to
oyster
bay
for
the
never
did
he
abandon
them
until
there
was
literally
not
a
shadow
of
hope
to
bank
on
when
the
colonel
got
into
action
something
always
happened
on
the
democratic
side
he
made
a
public
statement
to
senator
gallinger
of
new
hampshire
republican
leader
in
the
senate
in
which
lie
pointed
to
the
superior
support
of
the
republicans
and
urged
even
more
liberal
party
support
to
ensure
the
passage
of
the
amendment
in
the
senate
action
by
the
democrats
followed
fast
on
the
heels
of
this
public
statement
the
national
executive
committee
of
the
democratic
party
after
a
referendum
vote
of
the
members
of
the
national
committeemen
passed
a
resolution
calling
for
favorable
action
in
the
senate
mitchell
palmer
wrote
to
the
woman
party
saying
that
this
resolution
must
be
regarded
as
an
official
expression
of
the
democratic
party
through
the
only
organization
which
can
speak
for
it
between
national
conventions
the
republican
national
committee
meeting
at
the
same
time
commended
the
course
taken
by
republican
representatives
who
had
voted
for
the
amendment
in
the
house
and
declared
their
position
to
be
a
true
interpretation
of
the
thought
of
the
republican
party
republican
and

state
county
and

followed
the
lead
and
called
for

intermittent
attempts
on

side
to
force
action
followed
by
eloquent
speeches
from
time
to
time
piquing
their
opponents
left
the
democrats
across
the
path
the
majority
of
them
were
content
to
rest
upon
the
action
taken
in
the
house
i
was
at
this
time
chairman
of
the
political
department
of
the

and
in
that
capacity
interviewed
practically

just
returned
the
deadlock
was
brought
to
his
attention
he
immediately
responded
in
a
most
effective
way
in
a
brief
but
dramatic
speech
at
a
great
mass
meeting
of
the
woman
party
at
palm
beach
florida
he
said
the
story
of
the
brutal
imprisonment
in
washington
of
women
advocating
suffrage
is
shocking
and
almost
incredible
i
became
accustomed
in
russia
to
the
stories
of
men
and
women
who
served
terms
of
imprisonment
under
the
czar
because
of
their
love
of
liberty
but
did
not
know
that
women
in
my
own
country
had
been
subjected
to
brutal
treatment
long
since
abandoned
in
russia
i
wish
now
to
contribute
ten
thousand
dollars
to
the
campaign
for
the
passage
of
the
suffrage
amendment
through
the
senate
one
hundred
dollars
for
each
of
the
pickets
who
went
to
prison
because
she
stood
at
the
gates
of
the
white
house
asking
for
the
passage
of
the
suffrage
measure
this
was
the
largest
single
contribution
received
during
the
national
agitation
colonel
thompson
had
been
a
suffragist
all
his
life
but
he
now
became
actively
identified
with
the
work
for
the
national
amendment
since
then
he
has
continued
to
give
generously
of
his
money
and
to
lend
his
political
prestige
as
often
as
necessary
colonel
house
was
importuned
to
use
his
influence
to
win
additional
democratic
votes
in
the
senate
or
better
still
to
urge
the
president
to
win
them
colonel
house
is
an
interesting
but
not
unfamiliar
type
in
politics
extremely
courteous
mild
mannered
able
quickly
sympathetic
he
listens
with
undistracted
attention
to
your
request
his
round
bright
eyes
snap
as
he
comes
at
you
with
a
it
seems
so
reasonable
and
while
you
know
he
is
putting
back
upon
you
the
very
task
you
are
trying
to
persuade
him
to
undertake
he
does
it
so
graciously
that
you
can
scarcely
resist
liking
it
he
has
the
manner
of
having
done
what
you
ask
without
actually
doing
more
than
to
make
you
feel
warm
at
having
met
him
it
is
a
kind
of
elegant
statecraft
which
has
its
point
of
grace
but
which
is
exasperating
when
effectiveness
is
needed
not
that
colonel
house
was
not
a
supporter
of
the
federal
amendment
he
was
but
his
gentle
soft
and
traditional
kind
of
diplomacy
would
not
employ
pressure
i
shall
be
going
to
washington
soon
on
other
matters
and
i
shall
doubtless
see
the
president
perhaps
he
may
bring
up
the
subject
in
conversation
and
if
he
does
and
the
opportunity
offers
itself
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
some
such
gentle
threat
would
come
from
the
colonel
he
was
not
quite
so
tender
however
in
dealing
with
democratic
senators
after
the
president
declared
for
the
amendment
he
did
try
to
win
them
taft
then
joint
chairman
of
the
national
war
labor
board
was
interviewed
at
his
desk
just
after
rendering
an
important
democratic
labor
award
no
indeed
i
do
nothing
for
a
proposition
which
adds
more
voters
to
our
electorate
i
thought
my
position
on
this
question
was
well
known
said
taft
but
we
thought
you
doubtless
had
changed
your
mind
since
the
beginning
of
our
war
for
i
started
to
answer
this
is
not
a
war
for
democracy
he
said
emphatically
looking
quizzically
at
me
for
my
assertion
if
it
were
i
would
be
doing
anything
for
it
the
trouble
in
this
country
is
we
got
too
many
mm
voting
as
it
is
why
i
take
the
vote
away
from
most
of
the
men
he
added
i
wanted
to
ask
him
what
men
he
would
leave
voting
i
wanted
also
to
tell
him
they
were
taking
the
vote
away
from
one
class
of
men
in
russia
at
that
moment
instead
i
said
well
i
not
quite
sure
whom
we
could
trust
to
sit
in
judgment
he
looked
smiling
and
serene
as
much
as
to
say
oh
that
would
be
a
simple
matter
however
i
said
we
have
no
quarrel
with
you
you
are
an
avowed
aristocrat
and
we
respect
your
candor
our
quarrel
is
with
democrats
who
will
not
trust
their
own
doctrines
again
he
smiled
with
as
much
sophistication
as
such
a
placid
face
could
achieve
and
that
was
all
i
believe
taft
has
lately
modified
his
attitude
toward
women
voting
i
do
not
know
how
he
squares
that
with
his
distaste
of
democracy
there
was
samuel
gompers
president
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
high
in
administration
confidence
it
was
a
long
wait
before
abby
scott
baker
and
i
were
allowed
into
his
sanctum
well
ladies
what
can
i
do
for
you
was
the
opening
question
and
we
thought
happily
here
is
a
man
who
will
not
bore
us
with
his
life
record
on
behalf
of
women
he
comes
to
the
point
with
direction
will
you
speak
to
the
president
on
behalf
of
your
organization
which
has
repeatedly
endorsed
national
suffrage
to
induce
him
to
put
more
pressure
behind
the
senate
which
is
delaying
suffrage
we
asked
with
equal
direction
we
concealed
a
heavy
sigh
as
a
reminiscent
look
came
into
his
shrewd
wan
eyes
and
he
began
doubtless
you
ladies
do
not
know
that
as
long
ago
believe
that
was
the
my
organization
sent
a
petition
to
the
united
states
congress
praying
for
the
tion
of
this
very
amendment
and
we
have
stood
for
it
ever
since
do
you
think
it
is
about
time
that
prayer
was
answered
we
ventured
to
interrupt
but
his
reverie
could
not
be
disturbed
he
looked
at
us
coldly
for
he
was
living
in
the
past
and
continued
to
recount
the
patient
enduring
qualities
of
his
organization
i
will
speak
to
my
secretary
and
see
what
the
organization
can
do
he
said
finally
we
murmured
again
that
it
was
the
president
we
wished
him
to
speak
to
but
we
left
feeling
reasonably
certain
that
there
would
be
no
dynamic
pressure
from
this
cautious
leader
herbert
hoover
was
the
next
man
we
sought
here
we
encountered
the
secretary
who
would
not
carry
our
cards
into
his
chief
hoover
has
appointments
a
week
ahead
he
said
for
example
his
chart
for
includes
a
very
important
conference
with
some
grain
men
from
the
northwest
and
he
continued
to
recite
the
items
of
the
chart
ending
with
a
dinner
at
the
white
house
if
we
could
see
him
for
just
five
minutes
we
persisted
he
could
do
what
we
ask
this
very
night
at
the
white
house
but
the
secretary
was
obdurate
we
shall
leave
a
written
request
for
five
minutes
at
hoover
convenience
we
said
and
prepared
the
letter
time
passed
without
answer
baker
and
i
were
compelled
to
go
again
to
hoover
office
again
we
were
greeted
by
the
affable
secretary
who
on
this
occasion
recounted
not
only
his
chief
many
pressing
engagements
but
his
devoted
family
saturday
and
sunday
habits
which
were
so
dreadfully
cut
into
by
his
heavy
work
we
were
sympathetic
but
firm
would
hoover
not
be
willing
to
answer
our
letter
would
he
not
be
willing
to
state
publicly
that
he
thought
the
amendment
ought
to
be
passed
in
the
senate
would
the
secretary
in
short
please
go
to
him
to
ascertain
if
he
would
be
willing
to
say
a
single
word
in
behalf
of
the
political
liberty
of
women
the
secretary
disappeared
and
returned
to
say
hoover
wishes
me
to
tell
you
ladies
he
can
give
no
time
whatever
to
the
consideration
of
your
question
until
after
the
war
is
over
this
is
final
the
chief
food
administrator
would
continue
to
demand
sacrifices
of
women
throughout
the
war
but
he
would
not
give
so
much
as
a
thought
to
their
rights
in
return
hoover
was
the
only
important
man
in
public
life
who
steadfastly
refused
to
see
our
representatives
after
announcing
his
candidacy
for
nomination
to
the
presidency
he
authorized
his
secretary
to
write
us
a
letter
saying
he
had
always
been
for
woman
suffrage
bainbridge
colby
then
member
of
the
emergency
fleet
corporation
of
the
shipping
board
and
member
of
the
council
which
sat
on
shipping
problems
now
secretary
of
state
in
president
wilson
cabinet
was
approached
as
a
suffragist
known
to
have
access
to
the
president
colby
had
just
returned
from
abroad
when
i
saw
him
he
is
a
cultivated
gentleman
but
he
knows
how
to
have
superlative
enthusiasm
in
the
light
of
the
world
events
he
said
this
reform
is
insignificant
no
time
or
energy
ought
to
be
diverted
from
the
great
program
of
crushing
the
germans
but
can
we
not
do
that
i
asked
without
neglecting
internal
liberties
colby
is
a
strong
conformist
he
became
grave
when
i
was
indiscreet
enough
to
reveal
that
i
was
inclined
to
pin
my
faith
to
the
concrete
liberty
of
women
rather
than
to
a
vague
and
abstract
human
freedom
which
was
supposed
to
descend
upon
the
world
once
the
germans
were
beaten
i
know
he
wanted
to
call
me
seditious
but
he
is
a
gallant
gentleman
and
he
only
frowned
with
distress
he
continued
with
enthusiasm
to
plan
to
build
ships
bernard
baruch
then
member
of
the
advisory
committee
of
the
council
of
national
defense
later
economic
expert
at
the
peace
conference
was
able
to
see
the
war
and
the
women
problem
at
the
same
time
he
is
an
able
politician
and
was
therefore
sensitive
to
our
appeal
he
saw
the
passage
of
the
amendment
as
a
political
asset
i
do
not
know
how
much
he
believed
in
the
principle
that
was
of
minor
importance
what
was
important
was
that
he
agreed
to
tell
the
president
that
he
believed
it
wise
to
put
more
pressure
on
the
measure
in
the
senate
also
i
believe
baruch
was
one
member
of
the
administration
who
realized
in
the
midst
of
the
episode
that
arresting
women
was
bad
politics
to
say
nothing
of
the
doubtful
chivalry
of
it
george
creel
chairman
of
the
committee
on
public
information
was
also
asked
for
help
we
went
to
him
many
times
because
his
contact
with
the
president
was
constant
a
suffragist
of
long
standing
he
nevertheless
hated
our
militant
tactics
for
he
knew
we
were
winning
and
the
administration
was
losing
he
is
a
strange
composite
working
at
terrific
tension
and
mostly
under
fire
he
was
rarely
in
calm
enough
mood
to
sit
down
and
devise
ways
and
means
but
i
talk
to
the
president
every
day
on
this
matter
i
am
doing
all
i
can
the
president
is
doing
all
he
can
would
drive
at
stopping
for
breath
but
if
you
will
just
ask
him
to
get
senator
he
is
working
on
the
senator
now
you
people
must
give
him
time
he
has
other
things
to
do
he
would
say
sweeping
aside
every
suggestion
familiar
advice
charles
hilles
former
chairman
of
the
republican
national
committee
was
a
leader
who
had
come
slowly
to
believe
in
national
suffrage
but
once
convinced
he
was
a
faithful
and
dependable
colleague
who
gave
practical
political
assistance
william
randolph
hearst
in
powerful
editorials
called
upon
the
senators
to
act
caldwell
of
new
york
suffragist
financier
and
man
of
affairs
faithfully
and
persistently
stood
by
the
amendment
and
by
the
militants
a
more
generous
contributor
and
more
diligent
ally
could
not
be
found
a
host
of
public
men
were
interviewed
and
the
great
majority
of
them
did
help
at
this
critical
juncture
it
is
impossible
to
give
a
list
that
even
approaches
adequacy
so
i
shall
not
attempt
it
our
pressure
from
below
and
that
of
the
leaders
from
above
began
to
have
its
effect
an
attempt
was
made
by
administration
leaders
to
force
a
vote
on
may
friends
interceded
when
it
was
shown
that
not
enough
votes
were
pledged
to
secure
passage
again
the
vote
was
tentatively
set
for
june
and
again
postponed
the
republicans
led
by
senator
gallinger
provided
skirmishes
from
time
to
time
the
administration
was
accused
on
the
floor
of
blocking
action
to
which
accusation
its
leaders
did
not
even
reply
still
unwilling
to
believe
that
we
would
be
forced
to
resume
our
militancy
we
attempted
to
talk
to
the
president
again
a
special
deputation
of
women
munition
workers
was
sent
to
him
under
our
auspices
the
women
waited
for
a
week
hoping
he
would
consent
to
see
them
among
his
the
blue
devils
of
france
to
a
committee
of
indians
to
a
committee
of
irish
patriots
and
so
forth
no
time
was
the
answer
and
the
munition
workers
were
forced
to
submit
their
appeal
in
writing
we
are
only
a
few
of
the
thousands
of
american
women
they
wrote
the
president
who
are
forming
a
growing
part
of
the
army
at
home
the
work
we
are
doing
is
hard
and
dangerous
to
life
and
health
making
detonators
handling
tnt
the
highest
of
all
explosives
we
want
to
be
recognized
by
our
country
as
much
her
citizens
as
our
soldiers
are
tumulty
replied
for
the
president
the
president
asks
me
to
say
that
nothing
you
or
your
associates
could
say
could
possibly
increase
his
very
deep
interest
in
this
matter
and
that
he
is
doing
everything
that
he
could
with
honor
and
propriety
do
in
behalf
of
the
suffrage
amendment
an
opportunity
was
given
the
president
to
show
again
his
sympathy
for
a
endeavor
just
after
having
ignored
this
specific
opportunity
at
home
he
hastened
to
accept
the
larger
field
in
response
to
a
memorial
transmitted
through
carrie
chapman
catt
president
of
the
international
woman
suffrage
alliance
the
french
union
for
woman
suffrage
urged
the
president
to
use
his
aid
on
their
behalf
which
will
be
a
powerful
influence
for
woman
suffrage
in
the
entire
world
the
memorial
was
endorsed
by
the
suffrage
committee
of
great
britain
italy
belgium
and
portugal
the
president
took
the
occasion
to
say
the
democratic
reconstruction
of
the
world
will
not
have
been
completely
or
adequately
obtained
until
women
are
admitted
to
the
suffrage
as
for
america
it
is
my
earnest
hope
that
the
senate
of
the
united
states
will
give
an
unmistakable
answer
by
passing
the
federal
amendment
before
the
end
of
this
session
meanwhile
four
more
democratic
senators
pledged
their
support
to
the
amendment
influenced
by
the
president
declaration
of
support
and
by
widespread
demands
from
their
constituents
senators
phelan
of
california
king
of
utah
gerry
of
rhode
island
and
culberson
of
texas
abandoned
the
ranks
of
the
opposition
during
this
same
period
the
republican
side
of
the
senate
gave
five
more
republican
senators
to
the
amendment
they
were
senators
mccumber
of
north
dakota
kellogg
of
minnesota
harding
of
ohio
page
of
vermont
and
sutherland
of
west
virginia
all
of
these
men
except
senator
mccumber
were
won
through
the
pressure
from
republican
party
leaders
this
gain
of
nine
recruits
reduced
to
two
the
number
of
votes
to
be
won
when
at
the
end
of
seven
months
from
the
time
the
amendment
had
passed
the
house
we
still
lacked
these
two
votes
and
the
president
gave
no
assurance
that
he
would
put
forth
sufficient
effort
to
secure
them
we
were
compelled
to
renew
our
attacks
upon
the
president
senator
mccumber
though
opposed
was
compelled
to
support
the
measure
by
the
action
of
the
legislature
commanding
him
to
do
so
chapter
new
attacks
on
the
president
the
senate
was
about
to
recess
no
assurance
was
given
by
the
majority
that
suffrage
would
be
considered
either
before
or
after
the
recess
alarmed
and
aroused
we
decided
upon
a
national
protest
in
washington
august
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
inez
milholland
the
protest
took
the
form
of
a
meeting
at
the
base
of
the
lafayette
monument
in
the
park
directly
opposite
the
white
house
women
from
many
states
in
the
union
dressed
in
white
hatless
and
coatless
in
the
midsummer
heat
of
washington
marched
the
monument
carrying
banners
of
purple
white
and
gold
led
by
a
carrying
the
american
flag
they
made
a
beautiful
mass
of
color
as
they
grouped
themselves
around
the
statue
against
the
abundant
green
foliage
of
the
park
the
administration
met
this
simple
reasonable
form
of
protest
by
further
arrests

are
here
because
when
our
country
is
at
war
for
liberty
and
democracy
at
that
point
she
was
roughly
seized
by
a
policeman
and
placed
under
arrest
the
great
audience
stood
in
absolute
and
amazed
silence

she

waiting
patrol
one
after
another
came
forward
in
an
attempt
to
speak
but
no
one
was
allowed
to
continue
wholesale
arrests
followed
just
as
the
women
were
being
taken
into
custody
according
to
the
new
york
evening
world
of
august
the
president
walked
out
of
the
northeast
gate
of
the
white
house
and
up
pennsylvania
avenue
for
a
conference
with
director
general
of
railroads
mcadoo
the
president
glanced
across
the
street
and
smiled
before
the
crowd
could
really
appreciate
what
had
happened
women
had
been
hustled
to
the
police
station
by
the
wagon
load
their
gay
banners
floating
from
the
backs
of
the
somber
patrols
they
were
told
that
the
police
had
arrested
them
under
the
orders
of
ridley
the
president
military
aide
and
assistant
to
the
chief
engineer
attached
to
the
war
department
all
were
released
on
bail
and
ordered
to
appear
in
court
the
following
day
when
they
appeared
they
were
informed
by
the
attorney
that
he
would
have
to
postpone
the
trial
until
the
following
tuesday
so
that
he
might
examine
witnesses
to
see
what
offense
if
any
the
women
would
be
charged
with
i
can
not
go
on
with
this
case
he
said
i
have
had
no
orders
there
are
no
precedents
for
cases
like
these
the
women
demanded
that
their
cases
be
dismissed
or
else
a
charge
made
against
them
they
were
merely
told
to
return
on
the
appointed
day
such
was
the
indignation
aroused
against
the
administration
for
taking
this
action
that
senator
curtis
of
kansas
republican
whip
could
say
publicly
the
truth
of
this
statement
is
made
evident
by
the
admission
of
the
court
that
the
suffragists
are
arrested
upon
absolutely
no
charges
and
that
these
women
among
them
munition
workers
and
red
cross
workers
are
held
in
washington
until
next
tuesday
under
arrest
while
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia
decides
for
what
offense
any
they
were
arrested
the
meeting
was
called
to
make
a
justified
protest
against
continued
blocking
of
the
suffrage
amendment
by
the
democratic
majority
in
the
senate
it
is
well
known
that
of
the
republican
membership
in
the
senate
are
ready
to
vote
for
the
amendment
but
under
the
control
of
the
democratic
majority
the
senate
has
recessed
for
six
weeks
without
making
any
provision
for
action
on
this
important
amendment
in
justice
to
the
women
who
have
been
working
so
hard
for
the
amendment
it
should
be
passed
at
the
earliest
date
and
if
action
is
not
taken
on
it
soon
after
the
resumption
of
business
in
the
senate
there
is
every
possibility
that
it
will
not
be
taken
during
this
congress
and
the
victory
in
the
house
of
representatives
will
have
been
won
for
nothing
when
they
finally
came
to
trial
ten
days
after
their
arrest
to
face
the
charge
of
holding
a
meeting
in
public
grounds
and
for
eighteen
of
the
defendants
an
additional
charge
of
climbing
on
a
statue
the
women
answered
the
roll
call
but
remained
silent
thereafter
the
familiar
farce
ensued
some
were
released
for
lack
of
identification
the
others
were
sentenced
to
the
district
ten
days
if
they
had
merely
assembled
to
hold
a
public
meeting
for
fifteen
days
if
they
had
also
climbed
on
a
statue
the
administration
evidently
hoped
by
lighter
sentences
to
avoid
a
hunger
strike
by
the
prisoners
the
women
were
taken
immediately
to
a
building
formerly
used
as
a
man
workhouse
situated
in
the
swamps
of
the
district
prison
grounds
this
building
which
had
been
declared
unfit
for
human
habitation
by
a
committee
appointed
under
president
roosevelt
in
and
which
had
been
uninhabited
ever
since
was
now
reopened
nine
years
later
to
receive
women
who
had
attempted
to
hold
a
meeting
in
a
public
park
in
washington
the
women
protested
in
a
body
and
demanded
to
be
treated
as
political
prisoners
this
being
refused
all
save
two
very
elderly
women
too
frail
to
do
so
went
on
hunger
strike
at
once
this
last
lodgment
was
the
worst
hideous
aspects
which
had
not
been
encountered
in
the
workhouse
and
jail
proper
were
encountered
here
the
cells
damp
and
cold
were
below
the
level
of
the
upper
door
and
entirely
below
the
high
windows
the
doors
of
the
cell
were
partly
of
solid
steel
with
only
a
small
section
of
grating
so
that
a
very
tiny
amount
of
light
penetrated
the
cells
the
wash
basins
were
small
and
unsightly
the
toilet
open
with
no
pretense
of
covering
the
cots
were
of
iron
without
any
spring
and
with
only
a
thin
straw
pallet
to
lie
upon
the
heating
facilities
were
antiquated
and
the
place
was
always
cold
so
frightful
were
the
nauseating
odors
which
permeated
the
place
and
so
terrible
was
the
drinking
water
from
the
disused
pipes
that
one
prisoner
after
another
became
violently
i
can
hardly
describe
that
atmosphere
said
ascough
of
connecticut
it
was
a
deadly
sort
of
smell
insidious
and
revolting
it
oppressed
and
stifled
us
there
was
no
escape
as
a
kind
of
relief
from
these
revolting
odors
they
took
their
straw
pallets
from
the
cells
to
the
floor
outside
they
were
ordered
back
to
their
cells
but
refused
in
a
body
to
go
they
preferred
the
stone
floors
to
the
vile
odors
within
which
kept
them
nauseated
conditions
were
so
shocking
that
senators
began
to
visit
their
constituents
in
this
terrible
hole
many
of
them
protested
to
the
authorities
protests
came
in
from
the
country
too
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
day
the
administration
succumbed
to
the
hunger
strike
and
released
the
prisoners
trembling
with
weakness
some
of
them
with
chills
and
some
of
them
in
a
high
fever
scarcely
able
even
to
walk
to
the
ambulance
or
motor
car
we
had
won
from
the
administration
however
a
concession
to
our
protest
prior
to
the
release
of
the
prisoners
we
had
announced
that
in
spite
of
the
previous
arrests
a
second
protest
meeting
would
be
held
on
the
same
spot
a
permit
to
hold
this
second
protest
meeting
was
granted
us
i
have
been
advised
ridley
wrote
to
miss
paul
that
you
desire
to
hold
a
demonstration
in
lafayette
square
on
thursday
august
by
direction
of
the
chief
of
engineers
army
you
are
hereby
granted
permission
to
hold
this
demonstration
you
are
advised
good
order
must
prevail
we
received
yesterday
miss
paul
replied
your
permit
for
a
suffrage
demonstration
in
lafayette
park
this
afternoon
and
are
very
glad
that
our
meetings
are
no
longer
to
be
interfered
with
because
of
the
illness
of
so
many
of
our
members
due
to
their
treatment
in
prison
this
last
week
and
with
the
necessity
of
caring
for
them
at
headquarters
we
are
planning
to
hold
our
neat
meeting
a
little
later
we
have
not
determined
on
the
exact
date
but
we
will
inform
you
of
the
time
as
soon
as
it
is
decided
upon
it
was
reported
on
credible
authority
that
this
concession
the
result
of
a
conference
at
which
the
president
secretary
of
war
baker
and
colonel
ridley
were
present
it
was
said
that
secretary
baker
and
colonel
ridley
persuaded
the
president
to
withdraw
the
orders
to
arrest
us
and
allow
our
meetings
to
go
on
even
though
they
took
the
form
of
attacks
upon
the
president
two
days
after
the
release
of
the
women
the
republican
party
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
woman
suffrage
caucused
in
the
senate
in
favor
of
forcing
suffrage
to
a
vote
the
resolution
which
was
passed
unanimously
by
the
caucus
determined
to
insist
upon
consideration
immediately
and
to
insist
upon
a
final
vote
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
provided
that
this
resolution
shall
not
be
construed
as
in
any
way
binding
the
action
or
vote
of
any
member
of
the
senate
upon
the
merits
of
the
said
woman
suffrage
amendment
while
not
a
direct
attempt
therefore
to
win
more
republican
senators
this
proved
a
very
great
tactical
contribution
to
the
cause
the
republicans
were
proud
of
their
suffrage
strength
they
knew
the
democrats
were
not
with
the
congressional
elections
approaching
the
republicans
meant
to
do
their
part
toward
acquainting
the
country
with
the
administration
policy
of
vacillation
and
delay
this
was
not
only
helpful
to
the
republicans
politically
it
was
also
advantageous
to
the
amendment
in
that
it
goaded
the
majority
into
action
nine
months
had
passed
since
the
vote
in
the
house
and
we
were
perilously
near
the
end
of
the
session
when
on
the
of
september
senator
overman
democrat
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
stated
to
our
legislative
chairman
that
suffrage
was
not
on
the
program
for
this
session
and
that
the
senate
would
recess
in
a
few
days
for
the
election
campaigns
without
considering
any
more
legislation
on
the
same
day
senator
jones
chairman
of
the
suffrage
committee
announced
to
us
that
he
would
not
even
call
his
committee
together
to
consider
taking
a
vote
we
had
announced
a
fortnight
earlier
that
another
protest
would
be
held
at
the
base
of
the
lafayette
monument
that
day
september
at
four
no
sooner
had
this
protest
been
announced
than
the
president
publicly
stated
that
he
would
receive
a
delegation
of
southern
and
western
women
partisans
on
the
question
of
the
amendment
at
two
the
same
day
to
this
delegation
he
said
i
am
as
i
think
you
know
heartily
in
sympathy
with
you
i
have
endeavored
to
assist
you
in
every
way
in
my
power
and
i
shall
continue
to
do
so
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
urge
the
passage
of
the
amendment
by
an
early
vote
presumably
this
was
expected
to
disarm
us
and
perhaps
silence
our
demonstration
however
it
merely
moved
us
to
make
another
hasty
visit
to
senator
overman
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
and
to
senator
jones
chairman
of
the
suffrage
committee
between
the
hours
of
two
and
four
to
see
if
the
president
statement
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
to
secure
an
early
vote
had
altered
their
statements
made
earlier
in
the
day
these
administration
leaders
assured
us
that
their
statements
stood
that
no
provision
had
been
made
for
action
on
the
amendment
that
the
president
statement
did
not
mean
that
a
vote
would
be
taken
this
session
and
that
they
did
not
contemplate
being
so
advised
by
him
such
a
situation
was
intolerable
the
president
was
uttering
more
fine
words
while
his
administration
leaders
interpreted
them
to
mean
nothing
because
they
were
not
followed
up
by
action
on
his
part
we
thereupon
changed
our
demonstration
at
four
to
a
more
drastic
form
of
protest
we
took
these
words
of
the
president
to
the
base
of
lafayette
monument
and
burned
them
in
a
flaming
torch
a
throng
gathered
to
hear
the
speakers
ceremonies
were
opened
with
the
reading
of
the
following
appeal
by
richard
wainwright
wife
of
wainwright
lafayette
we
are
here
we
the
women
of
the
united
states
denied
the
liberty
which
you
helped
to
gain
and
for
which
we
have
asked
in
vain
for
sixty
years
turn
to
you
to
plead
for
us
speak
lafayette
dead
these
hundred
years
but
still
living
in
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
speak
again
to
plead
for
us
like
the
bronze
woman
at
your
feet
condemned
like
us
to
a
silent
appeal
she
offers
you
a
sword
will
you
not
use
for
us
the
sword
of
the
spirit
mightier
far
than
the
sword
she
holds
out
to
you
will
you
not
ask
the
great
leader
of
democracy
to
look
upon
the
failure
of
our
beloved
country
to
be
in
truth
the
place
where
every
one
is
free
and
equal
and
entitled
to
a
share
in
the
government
let
that
outstretched
hand
of
yours
pointing
to
the
white
house
recall
to
him
his
words
and
promises
his
trumpet
call
for
all
of
us
to
see
that
the
world
is
made
safe
for
democracy
as
our
army
now
in
france
spoke
to
you
there
saying
here
we
are
to
help
your
country
fight
for
liberty
will
you
not
speak
here
and
now
for
us
a
little
band
with
no
army
no
power
but
justice
and
right
no
strength
but
in
our
constitution
and
in
the
declaration
of
independence
and
win
a
great
victory
again
in
this
country
by
giving
us
the
opportunity
we
ask
to
be
heard
through
the
susan
anthony
amendment
lafayette
we
are
here
before
the
enthusiastic
applause
for
wainwright
appeal
had
died
away
miss
lucy
branham
of
baltimore
stepped
forward
with
a
flaming
torch
which
she
applied
to
the
president
latest
words
on
suffrage
the
police
looked
on
and
smiled
and
the
crowd
cheered
as
she
said
the
torch
which
i
hold
symbolizes
the
burning
indignation
of
the
women
who
for
years
have
been
given
words
without
action
for
five
years
women
have
appealed
to
this
president
and
his
party
for
political
freedom
the
president
has
given
words
and
words
and
words
women
receive
more
words
we
announce
to
the
president
and
the
whole
world
by
this
act
of
ours
our
determination
that
words
shall
not
longer
be
the
only
reply
given
to
american
determination
that
this
same
democracy
for
whose
establishment
abroad
we
are
making
the
utmost
sacrifice
shall
also
prevail
at
home
we
have
protested
to
this
administration
by
banners
we
have
protested
by
speeches
we
now
protest
by
this
symbolic
act
as
in
the
ancient
fights
for
liberty
the
crusaders
for
freedom
symbolized
their
protest
against
those
responsible
for
injustice
by
consigning
their
hollow
phrases
to
the
flames
so
we
on
behalf
of
thousands
of
suffragists
in
this
same
way
protest
against
the
action
of
the
president
and
his
party
in
delaying
the
liberation
of
american
women
jessie
hardy
mackaye
of
washington
then
came
forward
to
the
end
of
the
plinth
to
speak
and
as
she
appeared
a
man
in
the
crowd
handed
her
a
bill
for
the
campaign
in
the
senate
this
was
the
signal
for
others
bills
and
coins
were
passed
up
instantly
marshals
ran
hither
and
thither
collecting
the
money
in
improvised
baskets
while
the
cheers
grew
louder
and
louder
many
of
the
policemen
present
were
among
the
donors
burning
president
wilson
words
had
met
with
popular
approval
from
a
large
crowd
the
procession
of
women
was
starting
back
to
headquarters
the
police
were
eagerly
clearing
the
way
for
the
line
the
crowd
was
dispersing
in
order
the
great
golden
banner
president
what
will
you
do
for
woman
suffrage
was
just
swinging
past
the
white
house
gate
when
president
wilson
stepped
into
his
car
for
the
afternoon
drive
chapter
president
wilson
appeals
to
the
senate
too
late
the
next
day
the
administration
completely
reversed
its
policy
almost
the
first
senate
business
was
an
announcement
on
the
floor
by
senator
jones
chairman
of
the
suffrage
committee
that
the
suffrage
amendment
would
be
considered
in
the
senate
september
and
senator
overman
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
rather
shyly
remarked
to
our
legislative
chairman
that
he
had
been
mistaken
yesterday
it
was
now
in
the
legislative
program
the
senate
still
stood
votes
for
and
against
the
votes
lacking
the
president
made
an
effort
among
individual
democrats
to
secure
them
but
it
was
too
feeble
an
effort
and
he
failed
chairman
jones
took
charge
of
the
measure
on
the
floor
the
debate
opened
with
a
long
and
eloquent
speech
by
senator
vardaman
of
mississippi
democrat
in
support
of
the
amendment
my
estimate
of
woman
said
he
in
conclusion
is
well
expressed
in
the
words
employed
by
a
distinguished
author
who
dedicated
his
book
to
a
mountain
a
great
meadow
and
a
woman
the
mountain
for
the
sense
of
time
to
the
meadow
for
the
sense
of
space
and
of
everything
senator
mccumber
of
north
dakota
republican
followed
with
a
curious
speech
his
problem
was
to
explain
why
although
opposed
to
suffrage
he
would
vote
for
the
amendment
beginning
with
the
overworked
cave
man
and
beasts
of
the
forests
and
down
to
the
present
day
the
male
had
always
protected
the
female
he
always
would
forgetting
recent
events
in
the
capital
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
in
our
courts
she
ever
finds
in
masculine
nature
an
asylum
of
protection
even
though
she
may
have
committed
great
wrong
while
the
mind
may
be
convinced
beyond
any
doubt
the
masculine
heart
finds
it
almost
impossible
to
pronounce
the
word
against
a
woman
scarcely
had
the
galleries
ceased
smiling
at
this
idea
when
he
treated
them
to
a
novel
application
of
the
biological
theory
of
inheritance
the
political
field
he
declared
always
has
been
and
probably
always
will
be
an
arena
of
more
or
less
bitter
contest
the
political
battles
leave
scars
as
ugly
and
lacerating
as
the
physical
battles
and
the
more
sensitive
the
nature
the
deeper
and
more
lasting
the
wound
and
as
no
man
can
enter
this
contest
or
be
a
party
to
it
and
assume
its
responsibilities
without
feeling
its
blows
and
suffering
its
wounds
much
less
can
woman
with
her
more
emotional
and
more
sensitive
nature
but
you
may
ask
why
should
she
be
relieved
from
the
scars
and
wounds
of
political
contest
because
they
do
not
affect
her
alone
but
are
transmitted
through
her
to
generations
yet
to
come
the
faithful
story
of
the
sinking
ship
was
invoked
by
the
senator
from
north
dakota
one
might
almost
imagine
after
listening
to
congressional
debates
for
some
years
that
traveling
on
sinking
ships
formed
a
large
part
of
human
experience
fathers
sons
and
brothers
said
the
senator
in
tearful
voice
guarding
the
lifeboats
until
every
woman
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
has
been
made
safe
waving
adieu
with
a
smile
of
cheer
on
their
lips
while
the
wounded
vessel
slowly
bears
them
to
a
strangling
death
and
a
watery
tomb
belie
the
charge
that
woman
needs
her
citizenship
as
a
form
of
protection
in
spite
of
these
opinions
however
the
senator
was
obliged
to
vote
for
the
amendment
because
his
state
had
so
ordered
senator
hardwick
of
georgia
democrat
felt
somewhat
betrayed
that
the
suffrage
plank
in
the
platform
of
his
party
in
recommending
state
action
should
be
so
carelessly
set
aside
there
is
not
a
democratic
senator
present
said
hardwick
who
does
not
know
the
history
that
lies
back
of
the
adoption
of
that
plank
there
is
not
a
democratic
senator
who
does
not
know
that
the
plank
was
written
here
in
washington
and
sent
to
the
convention
and
represented
the
deliberate
voice
of
the
administration
and
of
the
party
on
this
question
which
was
to
remit
this
question
to
the
several
states
for
action
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
reported
to
have
sent
this
particular
plank
washington
supposedly
by
the
hands
of
one
of
his
cabinet
officers
the
fact
that
his
own
party
and
the
republican
party
were
both
advancing
on
suffrage
irritated
him
into
denouncing
the
alacrity
with
which
politicians
and
senators
are
trying
to
get
on
the
band
wagon
first
senator
mckellar
of
tennessee
democrat
reduced
the
male
superiority
argument
to
simple
terms
when
he
said
taking
them
by
and
large
there
are
brainy
men
and
brainy
women
and
that
is
about
all
there
is
to
the
proposition
our
armies
were
sweeping
victorious
toward
germany
there
was
round
on
round
of
eloquence
about
the
glories
of
war
rivers
of
blood
flowed
and
always
the
role
of
woman
was
depicted
as
a
contented
binding
of
wounds
there
were
those
who
thought
woman
should
be
rewarded
for
such
service
others
thought
she
ought
to
do
it
without
asking
anything
in
return
but
all
agreed
that
this
was
her
role
there
was
no
woman
voice
in
that
body
to
protest
against
the
perpetuity
of
such
a
role
the
remarks
of
senator
reed
of
missouri
democrat
typify
this
attitude
women
in
my
state
believe
in
the
doctrine
that
men
should
fight
the
battles
on
the
red
line
that
men
should
stand
and
bare
their
bosoms
to
the
iron
hail
and
that
back
of
them
if
need
be
there
shall
be
women
who
may
bind
up
the
wounds
and
whose
tender
hands
may
rest
upon
the
brow
of
the
valiant
soldier
who
has
gone
down
in
the
fight
but
sir
that
is
woman
work
and
it
has
been
woman
work
always
the
woman
who
gave
her
first
born
a
final
kiss
and
blessed
him
on
his
way
to
battle
had
according
to
the
senator
from
missouri
earned
a
crown
of
glory
gemmed
with
the
love
of
the
world
and
with
senator
walsh
of
montana
democrat
the
women
of
america
have
already
written
a
glorious
page
in
the
history
of
the
greatest
of
wars
that
have
vexed
the
world
they
like
cornelia
have
given
and
freely
given
their
jewels
to
their
country
some
of
us
wondered
senator
mclean
of
connecticut
republican
flatly
stated
that
all
questions
involving
declarations
of
war
and
terms
of
peace
should
be
left
to
that
sex
which
must
do
the
fighting
and
the
dying
on
the
battlefield
and
he
further
said
that
until
boys
between
and
who
had
just
been
called
to
the
colors
should
ask
for
the
vote
their
mothers
should
be
and
remain
both
proud
and
content
without
it
he
concluded
with
an
amusing
account
of
the
history
of
the
ballot
box
this
joint
resolution
he
said
goes
beyond
the
seas
and
above
the
clouds
it
attempts
to
tamper
with
the
ballot
box
over
which
mother
nature
always
has
had
and
always
will
have
supreme
control
and
such
attempts
always
have
ended
and
always
will
end
in
failure
and
misfortune
senator
phelan
of
california
democrat
made
a
straightforward
intelligent
speech
senator
beckham
of
kentucky
democrat
deplored
the
idea
that
man
was
superior
to
woman
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
of
romanticism
he
said
but
i
look
upon
woman
as
superior
to
man
therefore
he
could
not
trust
her
with
a
vote
he
had
the
hardihood
to
say
further
with
the
men
of
the
world
at
each
other
throats
woman
is
the
civilizing
refining
elevating
influence
that
holds
man
from
barbarism
we
charged
him
with
ignorance
as
well
as
romanticism
when
he
said
in
closing
it
is
the
duty
of
man
to
work
and
labor
for
woman
to
cut
the
wood
to
carry
the
coal
to
go
into
the
fields
in
the
necessary
labor
to
sustain
the
home
where
the
woman
presides
and
by
her
superior
nature
elevates
him
to
higher
and
better
conceptions
of
life
meanwhile
senator
shafroth
of
colorado
democrat
lifelong
advocate
of
suffrage
was
painstakingly
asking
one
senator
after
another
as
he
had
been
for
years
does
not
the
senator
believe
that
the
just
powers
of
government
are
derived
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
but
if
you
have
the
general
principle
acknowledged
that
the
just
powers
of
government
are
derived
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
so
forth
but
the
idea
of
applying
the
declaration
of
independence
to
modern
politics
fairly
put
them
to
sleep
these
samples
of
senatorial
profundity
may
divert
outrage
or
bore
us
but
they
do
not
represent
the
real
battle
it
is
not
that
the
men
who
utter
these
sentiments
do
not
believe
them
more
is
the
pity
they
do
but
they
are
smoke
skirmishes
of
eloquence
or
foolishness
they
do
not
represent
the
motives
of
their
political
acts
the
real
excitement
began
when
senator
pittman
of
nevada
democrat
attempted
to
reveal
to
the
senators
of
his
party
the
actual
seriousness
of
the
political
crisis
in
which
the
democrats
were
now
involved
he
also
attempted
to
shift
the
blame
for
threatened
defeat
of
the
amendment
to
the
republican
side
of
the
chamber
there
was
a
note
of
desperation
in
his
voice
too
since
he
knew
that
president
wilson
had
not
up
to
that
moment
won
the
two
votes
lacking
the
gist
of
senator
pittman
remarks
was
this
the
woman
party
has
charged
the
senate
woman
suffrage
committee
which
is
in
control
of
the
democrats
and
the
president
himself
with
the
responsibility
fob
obstructing
a
vote
on
the
measure
i
confess
said
he
that
this
is
having
its
effect
as
a
campaign
argument
in
the
woman
suffrage
states
senator
wolcott
of
delaware
democrat
interrupted
him
to
ask
if
this
was
the
party
that
has
been
picketing
here
in
washington
senator
pittman
having
just
paid
this
tribute
to
our
campaign
in
the
west
hastened
to
say
that
it
was
but
that
there
was
another
association
the
national
american
woman
suffrage
association
which
had
always
conducted
its
campaign
in
a
and
intelligent
way
and
which
had
never
mixed
in
politics
waving
a
copy
of
the
suffragist
in
the
air
senator
pittman
began
his
attempt
to
shift
responsibility
to
the
republican
side
for
the
critical
condition
of
the
amendment
he
denounced
the
republicans
for
caucusing
on
the
amendment
and
deciding
unanimously
to
press
for
a
vote
when
they
the
republicans
knew
there
were
two
votes
lacking
he
scored
us
for
having
given
so
much
publicity
to
the
action
of
the
caucus
and
declared
with
vehemence
that
a
trick
had
been
executed
through
senator
smoot
which
he
would
not
allow
to
go
unrevealed
senator
pittman
charged
that
the
republicans
had
promised
enough
votes
to
pass
the
amendment
and
that
upon
that
promise
the
democrats
had
brought
the
measure
on
the
floor
that
the
republicans
thereupon
withdrew
enough
votes
to
cause
the
defeat
of
the
amendment
whether
or
not
this
was
true
at
any
rate
as
senator
smoot
pointed
out
the
democratic
chairman
in
charge
of
the
measure
could
at
any
moment
send
the
measure
back
to
committee
safe
from
immediate
defeat
this
was
true
but
not
exactly
a
suggestion
to
be
welcomed
by
the
democrats
yes
replied
senator
pittman
and
then
if
we
move
to
refer
it
back
to
the
committee
the
senator
from
utah
would
say
again
democrats
are
obstructing
the
passage
of
this
amendment
we
told
you
all
the
time
they
wanted
to
kill
it
if
we
refer
it
back
to
the
committee
then
we
will
be
charged
as
we
have
been
all
the
time
in
the
suffrage
states
with
trying
to
prevent
a
vote
on
it
and
still
the
woman
party
campaign
will
go
on
as
it
is
going
on
now
and
if
we
vote
on
it
they
will
say
told
you
the
democrats
would
kill
it
because
the
president
would
not
make
on
his
side
vote
for
it
that
was
the
crux
of
the
whole
situation
the
democrats
had
been
manaeuvered
into
a
position
where
they
could
neither
afford
to
move
to
refer
the
amendment
back
to
the
committee
nor
could
they
afford
to
press
it
to
a
losing
vote
they
were
indeed
in
an
exceedingly
embarrassing
predicament
throughout
hours
of
debate
senator
pittman
could
not
get
away
from
the
militants
again
and
again
he
recited
our
deeds
of
protest
our
threats
of
reprisal
our
relentless
strategy
of
holding
his
party
responsible
for
defeat
or
victory
i
should
like
the
senator
interpolated
senator
poindexter
of
washington
republican
so
long
as
he
is
discussing
the
action
of
the
pickets
to
explain
to
the
senate
whether
or
not
it
is
the
action
of
the
pickets
the
militant
woman
party
that
caused
the
president
to
change
his
attitude
on
the
subject
was
he
coerced
into
supporting
this
measure
he
had
for
years
opposed
he
was
picketed
when
did
the
president
change
his
attitude
if
it
was
not
because
he
was
picketed
will
the
senator
explain
what
was
the
cause
of
the
change
in
the
president
attitude
pittman
did
not
reply
directly
to
these
questions
senator
reed
of
missouri
democrat
consumed
hours
reading
into
the
congressional
record
various
press
reports
of
militant
activities
he

if

did
not
believe
that
we
had
a

reed
made
no
direct
answer
lest
the
idea
get
abroad
from
the
amount
of
time
they
spent
in
discussing
the
actions
of
the
wicked
militants
that
we
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
situation
which
had
resulted
in
democratic
despair
senator
thomas
of
colorado
the
one
democrat
who
had
never
been
able
to
conceal
his
hostility
to
us
for
having
reduced
his
majority
in
arose
to
pay
a
tribute
to
the
conservative
suffrage
association
of
america
their
escutcheon
he
said
is
unstained
by
mob
methods
or
appeals
to
violence
it
has
neither
picketed
presidents
nor
populated
prisons
it
has
carried
no
banners
flaunting
insults
to
the
executive
while
the
militants
on
the
other
hand
have
indulged
in
much
tumult
and
vociferous
braying
all
for
notoriety
sake
the
galleries
smiled
as
he
counseled
the
elder
suffrage
leaders
not
to
lose
courage
nor
yet
be
fainthearted
for
this
handicap
would
soon
be
overcome
it
would
have
taken
an
abler
man
than
senator
thomas
in
the
face
of
the
nature
of
this
debate
to
make
any
one
believe
that
we
had
been
a
handicap
in
forcing
them
to
their
position
he
was
the
only
one
hardy
enough
to
try
after
this
debate
the
senate
adjourned
leaving
things
from
the
point
of
view
of
party
politics
tangled
in
a
hopeless
knot
it
was
to
untie
this
knot
that
the
president
returned
hastily
from
new
york
in
answer
to
urgent
summons
by
long
distance
telephone
and
went
to
the
capitol
to
deliver
his
memorable
address
vice
president
and
gentlemen
of
the
senate
the
unusual
circumstances
of
a
world
war
in
which
we
stand
and
are
judged
in
the
view
not
only
of
our
own
people
and
our
own
consciences
but
also
in
view
of
all
nations
and
all
peoples
will
i
hope
justify
in
your
thought
as
it
does
in
mine
the
message
i
have
come
to
bring
you
i
regard
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
in
the
constitutional
amendment
proposing
the
extension
of
the
suffrage
to
women
as
vitally
essential
to
the
successful
prosecution
of
the
great
war
of
humanity
in
which
we
are
engaged
i
have
come
to
urge
upon
you
the
considerations
which
have
led
me
to
that
conclusion
it
is
not
only
my
privilege
it
is
also
my
duty
to
appraise
you
of
every
circumstance
and
element
involved
in
this
momentous
struggle
which
seems
to
me
to
affect
its
very
processes
and
its
outcome
it
is
my
duty
to
win
the
war
and
to
ask
you
to
remove
every
obstacle
that
stands
in
the
way
of
winning
it
i
had
assumed
that
the
senate
would
concur
in
the
amendment
because
ho
disputable
principle
is
involved
but
only
a
question
of
the
method
by
which
the
suffrage
is
to
be
extended
to
women
there
is
and
can
be
no
party
issue
involved
in
it
both
of
our
great
national
parties
are
pledged
explicitly
pledged
to
equality
of
suffrage
for
the
women
of
the
country
neither
party
therefore
it
seems
to
me
can
justify
hesitation
as
to
the
method
of
obtaining
it
can
rightfully
hesitate
to
substitute
federal
initiative
for
state
initiative
if
the
early
adoption
of
the
measure
is
necessary
to
the
successful
cution
of
the
war
and
if
the
method
of
state
action
proposed
in
party
platforms
of
is
impracticable
within
any
reasonable
length
of
time
if
practicable
at
all
and
its
adoption
is
in
my
judgment
clearly
necessary
to
the
successful
prosecution
of
the
war
and
the
successful
realization
of
the
objects
for
which
the
war
is
being
fought
that
judgment
i
take
the
liberty
of
urging
upon
you
with
solemn
earnestness
for
reasons
which
i
shall
state
very
frankly
and
which
i
shall
hope
will
seem
as
conclusive
to
you
as
they
have
seemed
to
me
this
is
a
peoples
war
and
the
peoples
thinking
constitutes
its
atmosphere
and
morale
not
the
predilections
of
the
drawing
room
or
the
political
considerations
of
the
caucus
if
we
be
indeed
democrats
and
wish
to
lead
the
world
to
democracy
we
can
ask
other
peoples
to
accept
in
proof
of
our
sincerity
and
our
ability
to
lead
them
whither
they
wish
to
be
led
nothing
less
persuasive
and
convincing
than
our
actions
ours
professions
will
not
suffice
verification
must
be
forthcoming
when
verification
is
asked
for
and
in
this
case
verification
is
asked
for
asked
for
in
this
particular
matter
you
ask
by
whom
not
through
diplomatic
channels
not
by
foreign
ministers
not
by
the
intimations
of
parliaments
it
is
asked
for
by
the
anxious
expectant
suffering
peoples
with
whom
we
are
dealing
and
who
are
willing
to
put
their
destinies
in
some
measure
in
our
hands
if
they
are
sure
that
we
wish
the
same
things
that
they
wish
i
do
not
speak
by
conjecture
it
is
not
alone
the
voices
of
statesmen
and
of
newspapers
that
reach
me
and
the
voices
of
foolish
and
intemperate
agitators
do
not
reach
me
at
all
through
many
many
channels
i
have
been
made
aware
what
the
plain
struggling
workaday
folk
are
thinking
upon
whom
the
chief
terror
and
suffering
of
this
tragic
war
falls
they
are
looking
to
the
great
powerful
famous
democracy
of
the
west
to
lead
them
to
the
new
day
for
which
they
have
so
long
waited
and
they
think
in
their
logical
simplicity
that
democracy
means
that
women
shall
play
their
part
in
affairs
alongside
men
and
upon
an
equal
footing
with
them
if
we
reject
measures
like
this
in
ignorance
or
defiance
of
what
a
new
age
has
brought
forth
of
what
they
have
seen
but
we
have
not
they
will
cease
to
follow
or
to
trust
us
they
have
seen
their
own
governments
accept
this
pretation
of
democracy
old
governments
like
great
britain
which
did
not
profess
to
be
democratic
promise
readily
and
as
of
course
this
justice
to
women
though
they
had
before
refused
it
the
strange
revelations
of
this
war
having
made
many
things
new
and
plain
to
governments
as
well
as
to
peoples
are
we
alone
to
refuse
to
learn
the
lesson
are
we
alone
to
ask
and
take
the
utmost
that
women
can
give
and
sacrifice
of
every
kind
still
say
that
we
do
not
see
what
title
that
gives
them
to
stand
by
our
sides
in
the
guidance
of
the
affairs
of
their
nation
and
ours
we
have
made
partners
of
the
women
in
this
war
shall
we
admit
them
only
to
a
partnership
of
sacrifice
and
suffering
and
toil
and
not
to
a
partnership
of
privilege
and
of
right
this
war
could
not
have
been
fought
either
by
the
other
nations
engaged
or
by
america
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
services
of
the
women
services
rendered
in
every
sphere
only
in
the
fields
of
effort
in
which
we
have
been
accustomed
to
see
them
work
but
wherever
men
have
worked
and
upon
the
very
skirts
and
edges
of
the
battle
itself
we
shall
not
only
be
distrusted
but
shall
deserve
to
be
distrusted
if
we
do
not
enfranchise
them
with
the
fullest
possible
enfranchisement
as
it
is
now
certain
that
the
other
great
free
nations
will
enfranchise
them
we
can
not
isolate
our
thought
or
our
action
in
such
a
matter
from
the
thought
of
the
rest
of
the
world
we
must
either
conform
or
deliberately
reject
what
they
propose
and
resign
the
leadership
of
liberal
minds
to
others
the
women
of
america
arc
too
noble
and
too
intelligent
and
too
devoted
to
be
slackers
whether
you
give
or
withhold
this
thing
that
is
mere
justice
but
i
know
the
magic
it
will
work
in
their
thoughts
and
spirits
if
you
give
it
them
i
propose
it
as
i
would
propose
to
admit
soldiers
to
the
suffrage
the
men
fighting
in
the
field
for
our
liberties
and
the
liberties
of
the
world
were
they
excluded
the
tasks
of
the
women
lie
at
the
very
heart
of
the
war
and
i
know
how
much
stronger
that
heart
will
beat
if
you
do
this
just
thing
and
show
our
women
that
you
trust
them
as
much
as
you
in
fact
and
of
necessity
depend
upon
them
have
i
said
that
the
passage
of
this
amendment
is
a
vitally
necessary
war
measure
and
do
you
need
further
proof
do
you
stand
in
need
of
the
trust
of
other
peoples
and
of
the
trust
of
our
women
is
that
trust
an
asset
or
is
it
not
i
tell
you
plainly
as
of
our
armies
and
of
the
gallant
men
in
our
fleets
as
the
present
spokesman
of
this
people
in
our
dealings
with
the
men
and
women
throughout
the
world
who
are
now
our
partners
as
the
responsible
head
of
a
great
government
which
stands
and
is
questioned
day
by
day
as
to
its
purposes
its
principles
its
hopes
whether
they
be
serviceable
to
men
everywhere
or
only
to
itself
and
who
must
himself
answer
these
questionings
or
be
shamed
as
the
guide
and
director
of
forces
caught
in
the
grip
of
war
and
by
the
same
token
in
need
of
every
material
and
spiritual
resource
this
great
nation
possesses
tell
you
plainly
that
this
measure
which
i
urge
upon
you
is
vital
to
the
winning
of
the
war
and
to
the
energies
alike
of
preparation
and
of
battle
and
not
to
the
winning
of
the
war
only
it
is
vital
to
the
right
solution
of
the
great
problems
which
we
must
settle
and
settle
immediately
when
the
war
is
over
we
shall
need
then
a
vision
of
affairs
which
is
theirs
and
as
we
have
never
needed
them
before
the
sympathy
and
insight
and
clear
moral
instinct
of
the
women
of
the
world
the
problems
of
that
time
will
strike
to
the
roots
of
many
things
that
we
have
not
hitherto
questioned
and
i
for
one
believe
that
our
safety
in
those
questioning
days
as
well
as
our
comprehension
of
matters
that
touch
society
to
the
quick
will
depend
upon
the
direct
and
authoritative
participation
of
women
in
our
counsels
we
shall
need
their
moral
sense
to
preserve
what
is
right
and
fine
and
worthy
in
our
system
of
life
as
well
as
to
discover
just
what
it
is
that
ought
to
be
purified
and
reformed
without
their
counselings
we
shall
be
only
half
wise
that
is
my
case
this
is
my
appeal
many
may
deny
its
validity
if
they
choose
but
no
one
can
brush
aside
or
answer
the
arguments
upon
which
it
is
based
the
executive
tasks
of
this
war
rest
upon
me
i
ask
that
you
lighten
them
and
place
in
my
hands
instruments
spiritual
instruments
which
i
do
not
now
possess
which
i
sorely
need
and
which
i
have
daily
to
apologize
for
not
being
able
to
employ
applause
it
was
a
truly
beautiful
appeal
when
the
applause
and
the
excitement
attendant
upon
the
occasion
of
a
message
from
the
president
had
subsided
and
the
floor
of
the
chamber
had
emptied
itself
of
its
distinguished
visitors
the
debate
was
resumed
if
this
resolution
fails
now
said
senator
jones
of
washington
ranking
republican
member
of
the
suffrage
committee
it
fails
for
lack
of
democratic
votes
senator
cummins
of
iowa
republican
also
a
member
of
the
suffrage
committee
reminded
opponents
of
the
measure
of
the
retaliatory
tactics
used
by
president
wilson
when
repudiated
by
senators
on
other
issues
i
sincerely
hope
he
said
tauntingly
that
the
president
may
deal
kindly
and
leniently
with
those
who
are
refusing
to
remove
this
obstacle
which
stands
in
his
way
it
has
not
been
very
long
since
the
president
retired
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
vardaman
from
public
life
why
because
he
refused
at
all
times
to
obey
the
commands
which
were
issued
for
his
direction
the
junior
senator
from
georgia
hardwick
suffered
the
same
fate
how
do
you
hope
to
escape
my
democratic
friends
are
either
proceeding
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
president
is
insincere
or
that
they
may
be
able
to
secure
an
immunity
from
him
that
these
other
unfortunate
aspirants
for
office
failed
to
secure
senator
cummins
chided
senator
reed
for
denouncing
the
militants
who
sought
to
bring
their
influence
to
bear
upon
the
situation
in
rather
a
more
forcible
and
decisive
method
than
was
employed
by
the
national
association
i
did
not
believe
in
the
campaign
they
were
pursuing
not
one
senator
was
brave
enough
to
say
outright
that
he
did
but
that
was
simply
a
question
for
them
to
determine
and
if
they
thought
that
in
accordance
with
the
established
custom
the
president
should
bring
his
influence
to
bear
more
effectively
than
he
had
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
burn
his
message
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
carry
banners
in
ette
park
in
front
of
the
white
house
or
anywhere
else
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
bring
their
banners
into
the
capitol
and
display
them
with
all
the
force
and
vigor
which
they
could
command
i
did
not
agree
with
them
but
they
also
were
making
a
campaign
for
an
inestimable
and
a
fundamental
right
what
would
you
have
done
men
if
you
had
been
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
been
deprived
of
the
right
of
representation
have
the
militants
done
anything
worse
than
the
revolutionary
forces
who
gathered
about
the
tea
chests
and
threw
them
into
the
sea
i
do
not
believe
they
the
militants
committed
any
crime
and
while
i
had
no
particle
of
sympathy
with
the
manner
in
which
they
were
conducting
their
campaign
i
think
their
arrest
and
imprisonment
and
the
treatment
which
they
received
while
in
confinement
are
a
disgrace
to
the
civilized
world
and
much
the
more
a
disgrace
to
the
united
states
which
assumes
to
lead
the
civilized
world
in
humane
endeavor
they
disturbed
nobody
save
that
disturbance
which
is
common
to
the
carrying
forward
of
all
propaganda
by
those
who
are
intensely
and
vitally
interested
in
it
i
wish
they
had
not
done
it
but
i
am
not
to
be
the
judge
of
their
methods
so
long
as
they
confine
themselves
to
those
acts
and
to
those
words
which
are
fairly
directed
to
the
accomplishment
of
their
purposes
i
can
not
accept
the
conclusion
that
because
these
women
burned
a
message
in
lafayette
park
or
because
they
carried
banners
upon
the
streets
in
washington
therefore
they
are
criminals
the
time
had
come
to
take
the
vote
but
we
knew
we
had
not
won
the
roll
was
called
and
the
vote
stood
to
counting
all
pairs
we
had
lost
by
votes
instantly
chairman
jones
according
to
his
promise
to
the
women
changing
his
vote
from
yea
to
nay
moved
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
measure
and
thus
automatically
kept
it
on
the
calendar
of
the
senate
that
was
all
that
could
be
done
the
president
belief
in
the
power
of
words
had
lost
the
amendment
nor
could
he
by
a
speech
eloquent
as
it
was
break
down
the
opposition
in
the
senate
which
he
had
so
long
protected
and
condoned
our
next
task
was
to
secure
a
reversal
of
the
senate
vote
we
modified
our
tactics
slightly
chapter
more
pressure
our
immediate
task
was
to
compel
the
president
to
secure
a
reversal
of
two
votes
in
the
senate
it
became
necessary
to
enter
again
the
congressional
elections
which
were
a
month
away
by
a
stroke
of
good
luck
there
were
two
senatorial
new
jersey
and
new
vacancies
in
the
short
term
that
is
we
had
an
opportunity
to
elect
two
friends
who
would
take
their
seats
in
time
to
vote
on
the
amendment
before
the
end
of
this
session
it
so
happened
that
the
democratic
candidates
were
pledged
to
vote
for
the
amendment
if
elected
and
that
the
republican
candidates
were
opposed
to
the
amendment
we
launched
our
campaign
in
this
instance
for
the
election
of
the
democratic
candidates
we
went
immediately
to
the
president
to
ask
his
assistance
in
our
endeavor
we
urged
him
personally
to
appeal
to
the
voters
of
new
jersey
and
new
hampshire
on
behalf
of
his
two
candidates
as
party
leader
he
was
at
the
moment
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
the
success
of
these
two
suffragists
both
of
the
democratic
candidates
themselves
appealed
to
president
wilson
for
help
in
their
contests
on
the
basis
of
their
suffrage
advocacy
his
speech
to
the
senate
scarcely
cold
the
president
refused
to
lend
any
assistance
in
these
contests
which
with
sufficient
effort
might
have
produced
the
last
two
votes
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
of
such
pressure
upon
the
president
we
were
unable
to
interest
him
in
this
practical
endeavor
it
was
clear
that
he
would
move
again
only
under
attack
we
went
again
therefore
to
the
women
voters
of
the
west
and
asked
them
to
withhold
their
support
from
the
democratic
senatorial
candidates
in
the
suffrage
states
in
order
to
compel
the
president
to
assist
in
the
two
eastern
contests
this
campaign
made
it
clear
to
the
president
that
we
were
still
holding
him
and
his
party
to
their
responsibility
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
our
policy
was
to
oppose
the
democratic
candidates
at
elections
so
long
as
their
party
was
responsible
for
the
passage
of
the
amendment
and
did
not
pass
it
since
there
is
no
question
between
individuals
in
suffrage
are
all
could
not
increase
our
numerical
strength
it
could
however
and
did
demonstrate
the
growing
and
comprehensive
power
of
the
women
voters
shortly
before
election
when
our
campaign
was
in
full
swing
in
the
west
the
president
sent
a
letter
appealing
to
the
voters
of
new
jersey
to
support
hennessey
the
democratic
candidate
for
the
senate
he
subsequently
appealed
to
the
voters
of
new
hampshire
to
elect
jameson
candidate
for
democratic
senator
in
new
hampshire
we
continued
our
campaign
in
the
west
as
a
safeguard
against
relaxation
by
the
president
after
his
appeal
there
were
seven
senatorial
contests
in
the
western
suffrage
states
in
all
but
two
of
these
and
democratic
senatorial
candidates
were
defeated
in
these
two
states
the
democratic
majority
was
greatly
reduced
republicans
won
in
new
jersey
and
new
hampshire
and
a
republican
congress
was
elected
to
power
throughout
the
country
the
election
campaign
had
had
a
wholesome
effect
however
on
both
parties
and
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
factors
in
persuading
the
president
to
again
appeal
to
the
senate
immediately
after
the
defeat
in
the
senate
and
throughout
the
election
campaign
we
attempted
to
hold
banners
at
the
capitol
to
assist
our
campaign
and
in
order
to
weaken
the
resistance
of
the
senators
of
the
opposition
the
mottoes
on
the
banners
attacked
with
impartial
mercilessness
both
democrats
and
republicans

the

of

policemen
to

twisting

they
took

up

steps
through

door
and
down
into
the
guardroom
banners
confiscated
and
they
themselves
detained
for
varying
periods
of
time
when
the

insisted
on
knowing
upon
what
charges
they
were
held
they
were

told
that

done
outside
the
parliament
in
the
hague
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
american
politicians
could
be
so
devoid
of
humor
as
they
showed
themselves
the
panic
that
overwhelms
our
official
mind
in
the
face
of
the
slightest
irregularity
is
appalling
instead
of
maintaining
peace
and
order
the
squads
of
police
managed
to
keep
the
capitol
grounds
in
a
state
of
confusion
they
were
assisted
from
time
to
time
by
senate
pages
small
errand
boys
who
would
run
out
and
attack
mature
women
with
impunity
the
women
would
be
held
under
the
most
rigid
detention
each
day
until
the
senate
had
safely
adjourned
then
on
the
morrow
the
whole
spectacle
would
be
repeated
while
the
united
states
senate
was
standing
still
under
our
protest
world
events
rushed
on
german
autocracy
had
collapsed
the
allies
had
won
a
military
victory
the
kaiser
had
that
very
week
fled
for
his
life
because
of
the
uprising
of
his
people
we
are
all
free
voters
of
a
free
republic
now
was
the
message
sent
by
the
women
of
germany
to
the
women
of
the
united
states
through
miss
jane
addams
we
were
at
that
moment
heartily
ashamed
of
our
government
german
women
voting
american
women
going
to
jail
and
spending
long
hours
in
the
senate
guardhouse
without
arrests
or
charges
the
war
came
to
an
end
congress
adjourned
november
when
the
congress
reconvened
for
its
short
and
final
session
december
less
than
a
month
after
our
election
campaign
president
wilson
for
the
first
time
included
suffrage
in
his
regular
message
to
congress
the
thing
that
we
had
asked
of
him
at
the
opening
of
every
session
of
congress
since
march
there
were
now
fewer
than
a
hundred
days
in
which
to
get
action
from
the
senate
and
so
avoid
losing
the
benefit
of
our
victory
in
the
house
in
his
opening
address
to
congress
the
president
again
appealed
to
the
senate
in
these
words
and
what
shall
we
say
of
the
their
instant
intelligence
quickening
every
task
that
they
touched
their
capacity
for
and
cooperation
which
gave
their
action
discipline
and
enhanced
the
effectiveness
of
everything
they
attempted
their
aptitude
at
tasks
to
which
they
had
never
before
set
their
hands
their
utter
alike
in
what
they
did
and
in
what
they
gave
their
contribution
to
the
great
result
is
beyond
appraisal
they
have
added
a
new
luster
to
the
annals
of
american
womanhood
the
least
tribute
we
can
pay
them
is
to
make
them
the
equals
of
men
in
political
rights
as
they
have
proved
themselves
their
equals
in
every
field
of
practical
work
they
have
entered
whether
for
themselves
or
for
their
country
these
great
days
of
completed
achievement
would
be
sadly
marred
were
we
to
omit
that
act
of
justice
besides
the
immense
practical
services
they
have
rendered
the
women
of
the
country
have
been
the
moving
spirits
in
the
systematic
economies
in
which
our
people
have
voluntarily
assisted
to
supply
the
suffering
peoples
of
the
world
and
the
armies
upon
every
front
with
food
and
everything
else
we
had
that
might
serve
the
common
cause
the
details
of
such
a
story
can
never
be
fully
written
but
we
carry
them
at
our
hearts
and
thank
god
that
we
can
say
that
we
are
the
kinsmen
of
such
again
we
looked
for
action
to
follow
this
appeal
again
we
found
that
the
president
had
uttered
these
words
but
had
made
no
plan
to
translate
them
into
action
and
so
his
second
appeal
to
the
senate
failed
coming
as
it
did
after
the
hostility
of
his
party
to
the
idea
of
conferring
freedom
on
women
nationally
had
been
approved
and
fostered
by
president
wilson
for
five
solid
years
he
could
not
overcome
with
additional
eloquence
the
opposition
which
he
himself
had
so
long
formulated
defended
encouraged
and
solidified
especially
when
that
eloquence
was
followed
by
either
no
action
or
only
hearted
efforts
it
would
now
require
a
determined
assertion
of
his
political
power
as
the
leader
of
his
party
we
made
a
final
appeal
to
him
as
leader
of
his
party
and
while
still
at
the
height
of
his
world
power
to
make
such
an
assertion
and
to
demand
the
necessary
two
votes
chapter
the
president
sails
away
no
sooner
had
we
set
ourselves
to
a
brief
hot
campaign
to
compel
president
wilson
to
win
the
final
votes
than
he
sailed
away
to
france
to
attend
the
peace
conference
sailed
away
to
consecrate
himself
to
the
program
of
liberating
the
oppressed
peoples
of
the
whole
world
he
can
not
be
condemned
for
aiming
to
achieve
so
gigantic
a
task
but
we
reflected
that
again
the
president
had
refused
his
specific
aid
in
an
humble
aspiration
for
the
rosy
hope
of
a
more
boldly
conceived
ambition
it
was
positively
impossible
for
us
by
our
own
efforts
to
win
the
last
votes
we
could
only
win
them
through
the
president
that
he
had
left
behind
him
his
message
urging
the
senate
to
act
is
true
that
administration
leaders
did
not
consider
these
words
a
command
is
also
true
it
must
be
realized
that
even
after
the
president
had
been
compelled
to
publicly
declare
his
support
of
the
measure
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
his
own
leaders
to
take
seriously
his
words
on
suffrage
and
so
again
the
democratic
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
in
whose
keeping
the
program
lay
had
no
thought
of
bringing
it
to
a
vote
the
democratic
chairman
of
the
woman
suffrage
committee
assumed
not
the
slightest
responsibility
for
its
success
nor
could
he
produce
any
plan
whereby
the
last
votes
could
be
won
they
knew
as
well
as
did
we
that
the
president
only
could
win
those
last
votes
they
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
until
he
had
done
so
they
could
do
nothing
less
than
fifty
legislative
days
remained
to
us
something
had
to
be
done
quickly
something
bold
and
offensive
enough
to
threaten
the
prestige
of
the
president
as
he
was
riding
in
sublimity
to
unknown
heights
as
a
champion
of
world
liberty
something
which
might
penetrate
his
reverie
and
shock
him
into
concrete
action
we
had
successfully
defied
the
full
power
of
his
administration
the
odds
heavily
against
us
we
must
now
defy
the
popular
belief
of
the
world
in
this
apostle
of
liberty
this
was
the
feeling
of
the
four
hundred
officers
of
the
national
woman
party
summoned
to
a
three
days
conference
in
washington
in
december
it
was
unanimously
decided
to
light
a
fire
in
an
urn
and
on
the
day
that
the
president
was
officially
received
by
france
to
burn
with
fitting
public
ceremonies
all
the
president
past
and
present
speeches
or
books
concerning
liberty
freedom
and
democracy
it
was
late
afternoon
when
the
four
hundred
women
proceeded
solemnly
in
single
file
from
headquarters
past
the
white
house
along
the
edge
of
the
quiet
and
beautiful
lafayette
park
to
the
foot
of
lafayette
statue
a
slight
mist
added
beauty
to
the
pageant
the
purple
white
and
gold
banners
so
brilliant
in
the
sunshine
became
soft
pastel
sails
half
the
procession
carried
lighted
torches
the
other
half
banners
the
crowd
gathered
silently
somewhat
by
the
scene
massed
about
that
statue
we
felt
a
strange
strength
and
solidarity
we
felt
again
that
we
were
a
part
of
the
universal
struggle
for
liberty
the
torch
was
applied
to
the
logs
in
the
grecian
urn
at
the
edge
of
the
broad
base
of
the
statue
as
the
flames
began
to
mount
vida
milholland
stepped
forward
and
without
accompaniment
sang
again
from
that
spot
of
beauty
in
her
own
challenging
way
the
woman
marseillaise
even
the
small
boys
in
the
crowd
always
the
most
difficult
to
please
cheered
and
clapped
and
cried
for
more
john
rogers
chairman
of
the
national
advisory
council
said
as
president
of
the
ceremony
we
hold
this
meeting
to
protest
against
the
denial
of
liberty
to
american
women
all
over
the
world
we
see
surging
and
sweeping
irresistibly
on
the
great
tide
of
democracy
and
women
would
be
derelict
in
their
duty
if
they
did
not
see
to
it
that
it
brings
freedom
to
the
women
of
this
land
our
ceremony
is
planned
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
president
wilson
has
gone
abroad
to
establish
democracy
in
foreign
lands
when
he
has
failed
to
establish
democracy
at
home
we
burn
his
words
on
liberty
not
in
malice
or
anger
but
in
a
spirit
of
reverence
for
truth
this
meeting
is
a
message
to
president
wilson
we
expect
an
answer
if
the
answer
is
more
words
we
will
burn
them
again
the
only
answer
the
national
woman
party
will
accept
is
the
instant
passage
of
the
amendment
in
the
senate
the
few
hoots
and
jeers
which
followed
all
ceased
when
a
tiny
and
aged
woman
stepped
from
her
place
to
the
urn
in
the
brilliant
torch
light
the
crowd
recognized
a
veteran
it
was
the
most
dramatic
moment
in
the
ceremony
reverend
olympia
brown
of
wisconsin
one
of
the
first
ordained
women
ministers
in
the
country
then
in
her
year
gallant
pioneer
friend
and
colleague
of
susan
anthony
said
as
she
threw
into
the
flames
the
speech
made
by
the
president
on
his
arrival
in
france
i
have
fought
for
liberty
for
seventy
years
and
i
protest
against
the
president
leaving
our
country
with
this
old
fight
here
unwon
the
crowd
burst
into
applause
and
continued
to
cheer
as
she
was
assisted
from
the
plinth
of
the
statue
too
frail
to
dismount
by
herself
then
came
the
other
representative
women
from
massachusetts
to
california
from
georgia
to
michigan
each
one
consigning
to
the
flames
a
special
declaration
of
the
president
on
freedom
the
flames
burned
brighter
and
brighter
and
leapt
higher
as
the
night
grew
black
the
casual
observer
said
they
must
be
crazy
do
they
know
the
president
is
at
home
why
are
they
appealing
to
him
in
the
park
opposite
the
white
house
when
he
is
in
france
the
long
line
of
bright
torches
shone
menacingly
as
the
women
marched
slowly
back
to
headquarters
and
the
crowd
dispersed
in
silence
the
white
house
was
empty
but
we
knew
our
message
would
be
heard
in
france
chapter
watchfires
of
freedom
december
came
to
an
end
with
no
plan
for
action
on
the
amendment
assured
this
left
us
january
and
february
only
before
the
session
would
end
the
president
had
not
yet
won
the
necessary
votes
we
decided
therefore
to
keep
a
perpetual
fire
to
consume
the
president
speeches
on
democracy
as
fast
as
he
made
them
in
europe
and
so
on
new
year
day
we
light
our
first
watchfire
of
freedom
in
the
urn
dedicated
to
that
purpose
we
place
it
on
the
sidewalk
in
a
direct
line
with
the

the
wood
comes
from
a
tree
in

burns
gaily
women
with
banners
stand
guard
over
the
watchfire
a
bell
hung
in
the
balcony
at
headquarters
tolls
rhythmically
the
beginning
of
the
watch
it
tolls
again
as
the
president
words
are
tossed
to
the
flames
his
speech
to
the
workingmen
of
manchester
his
toast
to
the
king
at
buckingham
palace
we
have
used
great
words
all
of
us
we
have
used
the
words
and
and
now
we
are
to
prove
whether
or
not
we
understand
these
words
his
speech
at
brest
all
turn
into
ignominious
brown
ashes
the
bell
tolls
again
when
the
watch
is
changed
all
washington
is
reminded
hourly
that
we
are
at
the
president
gate
burning
his
words
from
washington
the
news
goes
to
all
the
world
people
gather
to
see
the
ceremony
the
omnipresent
small
boys
and
soldiers
jeer
and
some
tear
the
banners
a
soldier
rushes
to
the
scene
with
a
bucket
of
water
which
does
not
guish
the
flames
the
fire
burns
as
if
by
magic
a
policeman
arrives
and
uses
a
fire
extinguisher
but
the
fire
burns
on
the
flames
are
as
indomitable
as
the
women
who
guard
them
rain
comes
but
all
through
the
night
the
watchfire
burns
all
through
the
night
the
women
stand
guard
day
and
night
the
fire
burns
boys
are
permitted
by
the
police
to
scatter
it
in
the
street
to
break
the
urn
and
to
demolish
the
banners
but
each
time
the
women
rekindle
the
fire
a
squad
of
policemen
tries
to
demolish
the
fire
while
the
police
are
engaged
at
the
white
house
gates
other
women
go
quietly
in
the
dusk
to
the
huge
bronze
urn
in
lafayette
park
and
light
another
watchfire
a
beautiful
blaze
leaps
into
the
air
from
the
great
urn
the
police
hasten
hither
the
burning
contents
are
overturned
alice
paul
refills
the
urn
and
kindles
a
new
fire
she
is
placed
under
arrest
suddenly
a
third
blaze
is
seen
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
park
the
policemen
scramble
to
that
corner
when
the
watchfires
have
been
continued
for
four
days
and
four
nights
in
spite
of
the
attempts
by
the
police
to
extinguish
them
general
orders
to
arrest
are
sent
to
the
squad
of
policemen
five
women
are
taken
to
the
police
station
the
police
captain
is
outraged
that
the
ornamental
urn
valued
at
should
have
been
used
to
hold
a
fire
which
burned
the
president
words
his
indignation
leaves
the
defendants
unimpressed
however
and
he
becomes
conciliatory
will
the
ladies
promise
to
be
good
and
light
no
more
fires
in
the
park
instead
the
ladies
inquire
on
what
charge
they
are
held
not
even
the
police
captain
knows
they
wait
at
the
police
station
to
find
out
refusing
to
give
bail
unless
they
are
told
meanwhile
other
women
address
the
crowd
lingering
about
the
watchfire
the
crowd
asks
thoughtful
questions
little
knots
of
men
can
be
seen
discussing
what
the
whole
thing
is
about
anyway
miss
mildred
morris
one
of
the
participants
overheard
the
following
discussion
in
one
group
composed
of
an
old
man
a
young
sailor
and
a
young
soldier
but
whatever
you
think
of
them
the
sailor
was
telling
the
soldier
you
have
to
admire
their
sincerity
and
courage
got
to
do
this
thing
they
want
only
what
their
right
and
real
men
want
to
give
it
to
them
but
they
got
no
business
using
a
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
white
house
for
a
bonfire
declared
the
soldier
it
disloyal
to
the
president
i
tell
you
and
if
they
were
women
i
slap
their
faces
listen
sonny
said
the
old
man
patting
the
soldier
arm
i
as
loyal
to
the
president
as
any
man
alive
but
i
got
to
admit
that
he
ai
doing
the
right
thing
towards
these
women
he
forced
everything
else
he
wanted
through
congress
and
if
he
wanted
to
give
these
women
the
vote
badly
enough
he
could
force
the
suffrage
amendment
through
if
you
and
i
were
in
these
women
places
sonny
we
act
real
vicious
we
want
to
come
here
and
clean
out
the
whole
white
house
but
if
the
president
does
want
to
push
their
amendment
through
it
his
right
not
to
argued
the
soldier
nobody
business
how
he
uses
his
power
good
god
the
sailor
burst
out
why
do
you
go
over
and
get
a
job
shining
the
kaiser
boots
the
women
were
released
without
bail
since
no
one
was
able
to
supply
a
charge
but
a
thorough
research
was
instituted
and
out
of
the
dusty
archives
some
one
produced
an
ancient
statute
that
would
serve
the
purpose
it
prohibits
the
building
of
fires
in
a
public
place
in
the
district
of
columbia
between
sunset
and
sunrise
and
so
the
beautiful
elizabethan
custom
of
lighting
watchfires
as
a
form
of
demonstration
was
forbidden
in
a
few
days
eleven
women
were
brought
to
trial
there
was
a
titter
in
the
court
room
as
the
prosecuting
attorney
read
with
heavy
pomposity
the
charge
against
the
prisoners
to
wit
that
on
pennsylvania
avenue
northwest
in
the
district
of
columbia
they
did
aid
and
abet
in
setting
fire
to
certain
combustibles
consisting
of
logs
paper
oil
between
the
setting
of
the
sun
in
the
said
district
of
columbia
on
the
sixth
day
of
january
and
the
rising
of
the
sun
in
the
said
district
of
columbia
o
f
the
sixth
day
o
f
january
the
court
is
shocked
to
hear
of
this
serious

the

a

a

always
there
is
silence
in
a
benevolent
tone
the
judge
asks
the
policeman
to
identify
the
prisoners
they
identify
as
many
as
they
can
an
attempt
is
made
to
have
the
prisoners
rise
and
be
sworn
they
sit
we
will
go
on
with
the
testimony
says
the
judge
the
police
testify
as
to
the
important
details
of
the
crime
they
were
on
pennsylvania
avenue
they
looked
at
their
learned
it
was
about
saw
the
ladies
in
the
park
putting
wood
on
fires
in
urns
i
threw
the
wood
on
the
pavement
they
kept
putting
it
back
says
one
policeman
each
time
i
tried
to
put
out
the
fire
they
threw
on
more
wood
says
another
they
kept
on
lighting
new
fires
and
i
keep
putting
them
out
says
a
third
with
an
injured
air
the
prosecuting
attorney
asks
an
important
question
did
you
command
them
to
stop
i
did
sir
and
i
said
ladies
do
want
to
be
arrested
do
you
they
made
no
answer
but
went
on
attending
to
their
fires
the
statute
is
read
for
the
second
time
another
witness
is
called
this
time
the
district
attorney
asks
the
policeman
do
you
know
what
time
the
sun
in
the
district
of
columbia
set
on
january
and
rose
on
january
at
this
profound
question
the
policeman
hesitates
looks
abashed
then
says
impressively
the
sun
in
the
district
of
columbia
set
at
january
and
rose
at
january
the
prosecutor
is
triumphant
he
looks
expectantly
at
the
judge
how
do
you
know
what
time
the
sun
rose
and
set
on
those
days
asks
the
judge
from
the
weather
bureau
answers
the
policeman
the
judge
is
perplexed
i
think
we
should
have
something
more
official
he
says
the
prosecutor
suggests
that
perhaps
an
almanac
would
settle
the
question
the
judge
believes
it
would
the
government
attorney
disappears
to
find
an
almanac
breathless
the
prisoners
and
spectators
wait
to
hear
the
important
verdict
of
the
almanac
the
delay
is
interminable
the
court
room
is
in
a
state
of
confusion
the
prisoners
especially
are
amused
at
the
proceedings
it
is
clear
their
fate
may
hang
upon
a
minute
or
two
of
time
an
hour
goes
by
and
still
the
district
attorney
has
not
returned
another
half
hour
presently
he
returns
to
read
in
heavy
tones
from
the
almanac
the
policeman
looks
embarrassed
his
information
from
the
weather
bureau
differs
from
that
of
the
almanac
his
sun
rose
two
minutes
too
early
and
continued
to
shine
twelve
minutes
too
long
however
it
does
matter
the
sun
shone
long
enough
to
make
the
defendants
guilty
the
judge
looks
at
the
prisoners
and
announces
that
they
are
guilty
and
shall
pay
a
fine
of
or
serve
five
days
in
jail
the
administration
has
learned
its
lesson
about
hunger
strikes
and
evidently
fears
having
to
yield
to
another
strike
and
so
it
seeks
safety
in
lighter
sentences
the
judge
pleads
almost
piteously
with
them
not
to
go
to
jail
at
all
and
says
that
he
will
put
them
on
probation
if
they
will
promise
to
be
good
and
not
light
any
more
fires
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
prisoners
make
no
promise
they
have
been
found
guilty
according
to
the
almanac
and
they
file
through
the
little
gate
into
the
prisoners
pen
somehow
they
did
not
believe
that
whether
the
sun
rose
at
or
was
the
issue
which
had
decided
whether
they
should
be
convicted
or
not
and
it
was
not
in
protest
against
the
almanac
that
they
straightway
entered
upon
a
hunger
strike
meanwhile
the
watchfires
continued
in
the
capital
january
thirteenth
the
day
the
great
world
peace
conference
under
the
president
leadership
began
to
deliberate
on
the
task
of
administering
right
and
justice
to
all
the
oppressed
of
the
earth
women
were
arrested
in
front
of
the
white
house
another
trial
more
silent
prisoners
they
were
to
be
tried
this
time
in
groups
a
roar
of
applause
from
friends
in
the
courtroom
greeted
the
first
four
as
they
came
in
the
judge
said
that
he
could
not
possibly
understand
the
motive
for
this
outburst
and
added
if
it
is
repeated
i
shall
consider
it
contempt
of
court
he
then
ordered
the
bailiff
to
escort
the
four
prisoners
out
and
bring
them
in
of
school
days
and
if
there
is
any
applause
this
time
with
this
threat
still
in
the
air
the
prisoners
reentered
and
the
applause
was
louder
than
before
great
confusion
the
judge
roared
at
the
bailiff
the
bailiff
roared
at
the
prisoners
and
their
friends
finally
they
rushed
to
the
corners
of
the
courtroom
and
evicted
three
young
women
lock
the
doors
and
see
that
they
do
not
return
shouted
the
angry
judge
thus
the
dignity
of
the
court
was
restored
but
the
group
idea
had
to
be
abandoned
the
prisoners
were
now
brought
in
one
at
a
time
and
one
policeman
after
another
testified
that
she
kep
alightin
and
alightin
fires
five
days
imprisonment
for
each
woman
who
kep
alightin
watchfires
on
january
in
paris
president
wilson
received
a
delegation
of
french
working
women
who
urged
woman
suffrage
as
one
of
the
points
to
be
settled
at
the
peace
the
president
expressed
admiration
for
the
women
of
france
and
told
them
of
his
deep
personal
interest
in
the
enfranchisement
of
women
he
was
and
by
their
tribute
it
was
a
great
moment
for
the
president
he
had
won
the
position
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
of
a
devout
champion
of
the
liberty
of
women
but
at
the
very
moment
he
was
speaking
to
these
french
women
american
women
were
lying
in
the
district
of
columbia
jail
for
demanding
liberty
at
his
gates
mary
nolan
the
eldest
suffrage
prisoner
took
to
the
watchfire
those
vain
words
of
the
president
to
the
french
women
the
flames
were
just
all
sons
of
freedom
are
under
oath
to
see
that
freedom
never
suffers
when
a
whole
squadron
of
police
dashed
up
to
arrest
her
there
was
a
pause
when
they
saw
her
age
they
drew
back
for
an
instant
then
one
amongst
them
more
dutiful
than
the
rest
quietly
placed
her
under
arrest
as
she
marched
along
by
his
side
cheers
for
her
went
up
from
all
parts
of
the
crowd
say
what
you
think
about
them
but
that
little
old
lady
has
certainly
got
pluck
they
murmured
at
the
bar
nolan
beautiful
speech
provoked
irrepressible
applause
the
judge
ordered
as
many
offenders
as
could
be
recognized
brought
before
him
thirteen
women
were
hastily
produced
the
trial
was
suspended
while
the
judge
sentenced
these
thirteen
to
hours
in
jail
for
contempt
of
court
and
so
throughout
january
and
the
beginning
of
february
the
story
of
protest
continued
relentlessly
strikes
release
until
again
the
nation
rose
in
protest
against
imprisoning
the
women
and
against
the
senate
delay
peremptory
cables
went
to
the
president
at
the
peace
conference
commanding
him
to
act
news
of
our
demonstrations
were
well
reported
in
the
paris
press
the
situation
must
have
again
seemed
serious
to
him
for
although
reluctantly
and
perhaps
unwillingly
he
did
begin
to
cable
to
senate
leaders
who
in
turn
began
to
act
on
february
the
democratic
suffrage
senators
called
a
meeting
at
the
capitol
to
consider
ways
and
means
on
february
senator
jones
announced
in
the
senate
that
the
amendment
would
up
for
discussion
february
the
following
evening
february
a
caucus
of
all
democratic
senators
was
called
together
at
the
capitol
by
senator
martin
of
virginia
democratic
floor
leader
in
the
senate
this
was
the
first
democratic
caucus
held
in
the
senate
since
war
was
declared
which
would
seem
to
point
to
the
anxiety
of
the
democrats
to
marshal
two
votes
several
hours
of
very
passionate
debate
occurred
during
which
senator
pollock
of
south
carolina
announced
for
the
first
time
his
support
of
the
measure
senator
pollock
had
yielded
to
pressure
by
cable
from
the
president
as
well
as
to
the
caucus
this
gain
of
one
vote
had
reduced
the
number
of
votes
lacking
to
one
many
democratic
leaders
now
began
to
show
alarm
lest
the
last
vote
be
not
secured
william
jennings
bryan
was
one
leader
who
rightly
alarmed
over
such
a
situation
personally
consulted
with
the
democratic
opponents
the
argument
which
he
presented
to
them
he
subsequently
gave
to
the
press
woman
suffrage
is
coming
to
the
country
and
to
the
world
it
will
be
submitted
to
the
states
by
the
next
congress
if
it
is
not
submitted
by
the
present
congress
i
hope
the
democrats
of
the
south
will
not
handicap
the
democrats
of
the
north
by
compelling
them
to
spend
the
next
years
explaining
to
the
women
of
the
country
why
their
party
prevented
the
submission
of
the
suffrage
amendment
to
the
states
this
is
our
last
chance
to
play
an
important
part
in
bringing
about
this
important
reform
and
it
is
of
vital
political
concern
that
the
democrats
of
the
northern
mississippi
valley
should
not
be
burdened
by
the
charge
that
our
party
prevented
the
passage
of
the
suffrage
amendment
especially
when
it
is
known
that
it
is
coming
in
spite
of
if
not
with
the
aid
of
the
democratic
party
as
we
grew
nearer
the
last
vote
the
president
was
meeting
what
was
perhaps
his
most
bitter
resistance
from
within
it
was
a
situation
which
he
could
have
prevented
his
own
early
hostility
his
later
indifference
and
negligence
his
actual
protection
given
to
democratic
opponents
of
the
measure
his
own
reversal
of
policy
practically
at
the
point
of
a
pistol
the
efforts
made
by
him
on
its
behalf
were
all
coming
to
fruition
at
the
moment
when
his
continued
prestige
was
at
stake
his
power
to
get
results
on
this
because
of
belated
efforts
was
greatly
weakened
this
also
undermined
his
power
in
other
undertakings
essential
to
his
continued
prestige
whereas
more
effort
at
an
earlier
time
would
have
brought
fairer
results
now
the
opponents
were
solidified
in
their
opposition
were
through
their
votes
publicly
committed
to
the
nation
as
opponents
and
were
unwilling
to
sacrifice
their
heavy
dignity
to
a
public
reversal
of
their
votes
this
presented
a
formidable
resistance
indeed
therefore
the
democratic
blockade
continued
and
so
did
the
watchfires
chapter
burned
in
effigy
the
suffrage
score
now
stood
as
follows
one
vote
lacking
in
the
senate
days
in
which
to
win
it
and
president
wilson
across
the
sea
the
democrats
set
february
as
the
date
on
which
the
senate
would
again
vote
on
the
amendment
without
any
plan
as
to
how
the
last
vote
would
be
won
we
were
powerless
to
secure
the
last
vote
that
was
still
the
president
problem
knowing
that
he
always
put
forth
more
effort
under
fire
of
protest
from
us
than
when
not
pressed
we
decided
to
make
as
a
climax
to
our
watchfire
demonstrations
a
more
drastic
form
of
protest
we
wanted
to
show
our
contempt
for
the
president
inadequate
support
which
promised
so
much
in
words
and
which
did
so
little
in
deeds
to
match
the
words
and
so
on
the
day
preceding
the
vote
we
burned
in
effigy
a
portrait
of
president
wilson
even
as
the
revolutionary
fathers
had
burned
a
portrait
of
king
george
this
is
the
inscription
on
a
tablet
at
the
state
house
dover
green
dover
in
commemoration
of
delaware
revolutionary
leaders
signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
caeser
read
at
the
urgent
request
of
thomas
mckain
caesar
rodney
being
then
in
delaware
rode
post
haste
on
horseback
to
philadelphia
and
reached
independence
hall
july
the
following
day
news
of
the
adoption
of
the
declaration
of
independence
reaching
dover
a
portrait
of
king
george
was
burned
on
dover
green
at
the
order
of
the
committee
of
safety
the
following
historic
words
being
uttered
by
the
chairman
compelled
by
strong
necessity
thus
we
destroy
even
the
shadow
of
that
king
who
refused
to
reign
over
a
free
people
a
hundred
women
marched
with
banners
to
the
center
of
the
sidewalk
opposite
the
white
house
mingling
with
the
party
colored
banners
were
two
lettered
ones
which
read
only
fifteen
legislative
days
are
left
in
this
congress
for
more
than
a
year
the
president
party
has
blocked
suffrage
in
the
senate
it
is
blocking
it
today
the
president
is
responsible
for
the
betrayal
of
american
womanhood
why
does
not
the
president
insure
the
passage
of
suffrage
in
the
senate
why
does
he
not
win
from
his
party
the
one
vote
needed
has
he
agreed
to
permit
suffrage
again
to
be
pushed
aside
president
wilson
is
deceiving
the
world
he
preaches
democracy
abroad
and
thwarts
democracy
here
as
the
marchers
massed
their
banners
and
grouped
themselves
about
the
urn
a
dense
crowd
of
many
thousand
people
closed
in
about
them
a
crowd
so
interested
that
it
stood
almost
motionless
for
two
hours
while
the
ceremonies
continued
the
fire
being
kindled
and
the
flames
leaping
into
the
air
miss
sue
white
of
tennessee
and
gabrielle
harris
of
south
carolina
dropped
into
the
fire
in
the
urn
a
figure
of
president
wilson
sketched
on
paper
in
black
and
white
sort
of
effigy
de
luxe
we
called
it
but
a
symbol
of
our
contempt
none
the
less
henry
havemeyer
of
new
york
suffragist
and
woman
of
affairs
said
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
every
government
in
the
world
has
enfranchised
its
women
in
russia
in
hungary
in
austria
in
germany
itself
the
women
are
completely
enfranchised
and
women
are
now
sitting
in
the
new
reichstag
we
women
of
america
are
assembled
here
to
voice
our
deep
indignation
that
american
women
are
still
deprived
of
a
voice
in
their
government
at
home
we
mean
to
show
that
the
president
she
was
caught
by
the
arm
placed
under
arrest
and
forced
into
the
waiting
patrol
wagon
thereupon
the
police
fell
upon
the
ceremonies
and
indiscriminate
arrests
followed
women
with
banners
were
taken
women
without
banners
were
taken
women
attempting
to
guard
the
fire
women
standing
by
doing
nothing
at
all
all
were
seized
upon
and
rushed
to
the
patrol
while
this
uproar
was
going
on
others
attempted
to
continue
the
speaking
where
havemeyer
had
left
it
but
each
was
apprehended
as
she
made
her
attempt
some
that
had
been
scheduled
to
speak
but
were
too
shy
to
utter
a
word
in
the
excitement
were
also
taken
when
the
black
marias
were
all
filled
to
capacity
nearby
automobiles
were
commandeered
and
more
patrols
summoned
and
still
not
even
half
the
women
were
captured
the
police
ceased
their
raids
suddenly
orders
to
arrest
no
more
had
evidently
been
given
some
one
must
have
suggested
that
a
hundred
additions
to
the
already
overcrowded
jail
and
workhouse
would
be
too
embarrassing
perhaps
the
ruse
of
arresting
some
and
hoping
the
others
would
scamper
away
at
the
sight
of
authority
was
still
in
their
minds
after
a
brief
respite
they
turned
their
attention
to
the
fascinated
crowd
they
succeeded
in
forcing
back
these
masses
of
people
half
way
across
pennsylvania
avenue
and
stationed
an
officer
every
two
feet
in
front
of
them
but
still
women
came
to
keep
the
fire
burning
was
there
no
end
of
this
battalion
of
women
the
police
finally
declared
a
military
zone
between
the
encircling
crowd
and
the
remaining
women
and
no
person
was
allowed
to
enter
the
proscribed
area
for
another
hour
then
the
women
stood
on
guard
at
the
urn
and
as
night
fell
the
ceremonies
ended
sixty
of
them
marched
back
to
headquarters
had
been
arrested
the
following
morning
february
saw
two
not
unrelated
scenes
in
the
capital
senators
were
gathering
in
their
seats
in
the
senate
chamber
to
answer
to
the
roll
call
on
the
suffrage
amendment
a
few
blocks
away
in
the
courthouse
women
were
being
tried
for
their
protest
of
the
previous
day
there
was
no
uncertainty
either
in
the
minds
of
the
galleries
or
of
the
senators
every
one
knew
that
we
still
lacked
one
vote
the
debate
was
confined
to
two
speeches
one
for
and
one
against
when
the
roll
was
called
there
were
voting
and
paired
in
favor
of
the
amendment
senators
there
were
voting
and
paired
against
the
amendment
senators
the
amendment
lost
therefore
by
one
vote
of
the
favorable
votes
were
republicans
and
democrats
of
the
adverse
votes
were
republicans
and
democrats
this
means
that
of
the
republicans
in
the
senate
or
per
cent
voted
for
the
amendment
of
the
democrats
in
the
senate
or
per
cent
voted
for
it
and
so
it
was
again
defeated
by
the
opposition
of
the
democratic
administration
and
by
the
failure
of
the
president
to
put
behind
it
enough
power
to
win
meanwhile
another
burlesque
of
justice
dragged
wearily
on
in
the
dim
courtroom
the
judge
was
sentencing
women
to
prison
when
the
had
been
reached
he
said
wearily
how
many
more
are
out
there
when
told
that
he
had
tried
only
of
the
defendants
he
dismissed
the
remaining
thirteen
without
trial
they
were
as
guilty
as
their
colleagues
but
the
judge
was
tired
women
sent
to
jail
is
a
full
judicial
day
work
i
suppose
there
was
some
rather
obvious
shame
and
unhappiness
in
the
senate
because
of
the
petty
thing
they
had
done
the
prisoners
in
the
courtroom
were
proud
because
they
had
done
their
utmost
for
the
principle
in
which
they
believed
senator
jones
of
new
mexico
chairman
of
the
committee
and
his
democratic
colleagues
refused
to
reintroduce
the
susan
anthony
amendment
in
the
senate
immediately
after
this
defeat
but
on
monday
february
senator
jones
of
washington
ranking
republican
on
the
suffrage
committee
obtained
unanimous
consent
and
reintroduced
it
thereby
placing
it
once
more
on
its
way
to
early
reconsideration
chapter
boston
militants
welcome
the
president
it
was
announced
that
the
president
would
return
to
america
on
february
that
would
leave
seven
days
in
which
he
could
act
before
the
session
ended
on
march
we
determined
to
make
another
dramatic
effort
to
move
him
further
boston
was
to
be
the
president
landing
place
boston
where
ancient
liberties
are
so
venerated
and
modern
ones
so
abridged
no
more
admirable
place
could
have
been
found
to
welcome
the
president
home
in
true
militant
fashion
wishing
the
whole
world
to
know
that
women
were
greeting
president
wilson
why
they
were
greeting
him
and
what
form
of
demonstration
the
greetings
would
assume
we
announced
our
plans
in
advance
upon
his
arrival
a
line
of
pickets
would
hold
banners
silently
calling
to
the
president
attention
the
demand
for
his
effective
aid
in
the
afternoon
they
would
hold
a
meeting
in
boston
common
and
there
burn
the
parts
of
the
president
boston
speech
which
should
pertain
to
democracy
and
liberty
these
announcements
were
met
with
official
alarm
of
almost
unbelievable
extent
whereas
front
pages
had
been
given
over
heretofore
to
publishing
the
elaborate
plans
for
the
welcome
to
be
extended
to
the
president
eulogies
of
the
president
and
recitals
of
his
great
triumph
abroad
now
the
large
proportion
of
this
space
was
devoted
to
clever
plans
of
the
police
to
outwit
the
suffragists
the
sustained
publicity
of
this
demonstration
was
unprecedented
it
actually
filled
the
boston
papers
for
all
of
two
weeks
a
deadline
a
diagram
of
which
appeared
in
the
press
was
to
be
established
beyond
which
no
suffragist
no
matter
how
enterprising
could
penetrate
to
harass
the
president
with
foolish
ideas
about
the
importance
of
liberty
for
women
had
not
this
great
man
the
cares
of
the
world
on
his
shoulders
this
was
no
time
to
talk
about
liberty
for
women
the
world
was
rocking
and
a
great
peace
conference
was
sitting
and
the
president
was
just
returning
to
report
on
the
work
done
so
far
the
boston
descendants
of
the
early
revolutionists
would
do
their
utmost
to
see
that
no
untoward
event
should
mar
the
perfection
of
their
plans
they
would
see
to
it
that
the
sacred
soil
of
the
old
boston
common
should
not
be
disgraced
it
was
a
perfect
day
lines
of
marines
whose
trappings
shone
brilliantly
in
the
clear
sunshine
were
in
formation
to
hold
back
the
crowds
from
the
reviewing
stand
where
the
president
should
appear
after
heading
the
procession
in
his
honor
it
seemed
as
if
all
boston
were
on
hand
for
the
welcome
a
slender
file
of
women
marched
silently
into
the
sunshine
slipped
through
the
and
made
its
way
to
the
of
the
reviewing
stand
there
it
unfurled
its
beautiful
banners
and
took
up
its
post
directly
facing
the
line
of
marines
which
was
supposed
to
keep
all
suffragists
at
bay
quite
calmly
and
yet
triumphantly
they
stood
there
a
pageant
of
beauty
and
defiant
appeal
which
not
even
the
most
hurried
passerby
could
fail
to
see
and
comprehend
there
were
consultations
by
the
officials
in
charge
of
the
ceremonies
the
women
looked
harmless
enough
but
had
they
not
been
told
that
they
must
not
come
there
they
were
causing
no
riot
in
fact
they
were
clearly
adding
much
beauty
people
seemed
to
take
them
as
part
of
the
elaborate
ceremony
but
officials
seldom
have
sense
of
humor
enough
or
adaptability
enough
to
change
quickly
especially
when
they
have
made
threats
it
would
be
a
taint
on
their
honor
if
they
did
not
pick
up
the
women
for
the
deed
one
could
hear
the
people
reading
slowly
the
large
lettered
banner
president
you
said
in
the
senate
on
september
we
shall
not
only
be
distrusted
but
we
shall
deserve
to
be
distrusted
if
we
do
not
enfranchise
women
you
alone
can
remove
this
distrust
now
by
securing
the
one
vote
needed
to
pass
the
suffrage
amendment
before
march
the
american
flag
carried
by
miss
katherine
morey
of
brookline
held
the
place
of
honor
at
the
head
of
the
line
and
there
were
the
familiar
president
how
long
must
women
wait
for
liberty
and
president
what
will
you
do
for
woman
suffrage
the
other
banners
were
simply
purple
white
and
gold
when
we
had
stood
there
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
said
katherine
morey
superintendent
crowley
came
to
me
and
said
want
to
be
as
nice
as
we
can
to
you
suffragette
ladies
but
you
can
not
stand
here
while
the
president
goes
by
so
you
might
as
well
go
back
now
i
said
i
was
sorry
but
as
we
had
come
simply
to
be
there
at
that
very
time
we
would
not
be
able
to
go
back
until
the
president
had
gone
by
he
thereupon
made
a
final
appeal
to
miss
paul
who
was
at
headquarters
but
she
only
repeated
our
statement
the
patrol
wagons
were
hurried
to
the
scene
and
the
arrests
were
executed
in
an
exceedingly
gentlemanly
manner
but
the
effect
on
the
crowd
was
electric
the
sight
of
being
put
into
patrols
seemed
to
thrill
the
boston
masses
as
nothing
the
president
subsequently
said
was
able
to
we
were
taken
to
the
house
of
detention
and
there
charged
with
more
than
seven
minutes
as
agnes
morey
massachusetts
chairman
of
the
party
later
remarked
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
thousands
loitered
from
curiosity
on
the
day
the
president
arrived
loitered
for
liberty
and
only
those
who
loitered
for
liberty
were
arrested
realizing
that
the
event
of
the
morning
had
diverted
public
attention
to
our
issue
and
undismayed
by
the
arrests
other
women
entered
the
lists
to
sustain
public
attention
upon
our
demand
to
the
president
the
ceremony
on
the
common
began
at
three
throngs
of
people
packed
in
closely
in
an
effort
to
hear
the
speakers
and
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
ceremony
presided
over
by
louise
sykes
of
cambridge
whose
late
husband
was
president
of
the
connecticut
college
for
women
from
three
until
six
women
explained
the
purpose
of
the
protest
the
status
of
the
amendment
and
urged
those
present
to
help
at
six
came
the
order
to
arrest
jack
wife
of
professor
jack
of
harvard
university
mortimer
warren
of
boston
whose
husband
was
head
of
a
base
hospital
in
france
and
miss
elsie
hill
daughter
of
the
late
congressman
hill
were
arrested
and
were
taken
to
the
house
of
detention
where
they
joined
their
comrades
dirty
filthy
hole
under
the
court
house
was
the
general
characterization
of
the
house
of
detention
jail
was
a
paradise
compared
to
this
depraved
place
said
miss
morey
we
slept
in
our
clothes
four
women
to
a
cell
on
iron
shelves
two
feet
wide
in
the
cell
was
an
open
toilet
the
place
slowly
filled
up
during
the
night
with
drunks
and
disorderlies
until
pandemonium
reigned
in
the
evening
superintendent
crowley
and
commissioner
curtis
came
to
call
on
us
i
do
believe
they
had
ever
been
there
before
and
they
were
painfully
embarrassed
superintendent
crowley
said
to
me
if
you
were
drunk
we
could
release
you
in
the
morning
but
unfortunately
since
you
are
not
we
have
got
to
take
you
into
court
when
the
prisoners
were
told
next
morning
the
decision
of
chief
justice
bolster
to
try
each
prisoner
separately
and
in
closed
court
they
all
protested
against
such
proceedings
but
guards
took
the
women
by
force
to
a
private
room
the
matron
who
was
terrified
said
miss
morey
shouted
to
the
guards
handle
the
drunks
that
way
you
know
you
do
but
they
continued
to
push
shove
and
shake
the
women
while
forcing
them
to
the
ante
room
as
an
american
citizen
under
arrest
i
demand
a
public
trial
was
the
statement
of
each
on
entering
the
judge
private
trial
room
while
the
trial
was
proceeding
without
the
women
cooperation
some
were
tried
under
wrong
names
some
were
tried
more
than
once
under
different
names
but
most
of
them
under
the
name
of
jane
protests
were
being
made
to
all
the
city
officials
by
individuals
among
the
throngs
who
had
come
to
the
court
house
to
attend
the
trial
this
protest
was
so
strong
that
the
last
three
women
were
tried
in
open
court
the
judge
sentenced
everybody
impartially
to
eight
days
in
j
ail
in
lieu
of
fines
with
the
exception
of
miss
wilma
henderson
who
was
released
when
it
was
learned
that
she
was
a
minor
the
women
were
taken
to
the
charles
street
jail
to
serve
their
sentences
the
cells
were
immaculately
clean
said
miss
morey
but
there
was
one
feature
of
this
experience
which
obliterated
all
its
advantages
the
cells
were
without
modern
toilet
facilities
the
toilet
equipment
consisted
of
a
heavy
wooden
bucket
about
two
and
a
half
feet
high
and
a
foot
and
a
half
in
diameter
half
filled
with
water
no
one
of
us
will
ever
forget
that
foul
bucket
it
had
to
be
carried
to
the
lower
were
on
the
third
and
fourth
morning
i
could
hardly
lift
mine
off
the
floor
to
say
nothing
of
getting
it
down
stairs
miss
morey
weighs
pounds
so
there
it
stayed
berry
pottier
managed
to
get
hers
down
but
was
so
exhausted
she
was
utterly
unable
to
get
it
back
to
her
cell
the
other
toilet
facility
provided
was
a
smaller
bucket
of
water
to
wash
in
but
it
was
of
such
a
strangely
unpleasant
odor
that
we
did
not
dare
use
it
the
boston
reporters
were
admitted
they
wrote
columns
of
copy
there
was
the
customary
ridicule
but
there
were
friendly
light
touches
such
as
militant
be
roommates
at
vassar
college
and
then
to
meet
again
as
cellmates
was
the
experience
of
miss
elsie
hill
and
lois
warren
shaw
superintendent
kelleher
did
know
when
he
was
in
congress
with
elsie
hill
father
he
would
some
day
have
congressman
hill
daughter
in
his
jail
and
there
were
friendly
serious
touches
in
these
pages
of
sensational
as
this
excerpt
from
the
front
page
of
the
boston
traveler
of
february
the
reporter
admired
the
spirit
of
the
women
though
weary
from
loss
of
sleep
the
fire
of
a
great
purpose
burned
in
their
eyes
it
was
a
sublime
forgetting
of
self
for
the
goal
ahead
and
whether
the
reader
is
in
sympathy
with
the
principle
for
which
these
women
are
ready
to
suffer
or
not
he
will
be
forced
to
admire
the
spirit
which
leads
them
on
photographs
of
the
women

their

telegrams
of
protest
from
all
over
the
country
poured
in
upon
all
the
boston
officials
who
had
had
any
point
of
contact
with
the
militants
all
other
work
was
for
the
moment
pended
such
is
the
quality
of
morey
organizing
genius
that
she
did
not
let
a
solitary
official
escape
telegrams
also
went
from
boston
and
especially
from
the
jail
to
president
wilson
official
boston
was
in
the
grip
of
this
militant
invasion
when
suddenly
a
man
of
mystery
one
howe
appeared
and
paid
the
women
fines
it
was
later
discovered
that
the
mysterious
howe
alleged
to
have
acted
for
a
client
whether
the
client
was
a
part
of
official
boston
no
one
ever
knew
there
were
rumors
that
the
city
wished
to
end
its
embarrassment
sedate
boston
had
been
profoundly
shaken
sedate
boston
gave
more
generously
than
ever
before
to
militant
finances
and
when
the
prison
special
arrived
a
few
days
later
a
boston
theatre
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
a
crowd
eager
to
hear
more
about
their
local
heroines
and
to
cheer
them
while
they
were
decorated
with
the
already
famous
prison
pin
something
happened
in
washington
too
after
the
president
safe
journey
thither
from
boston
chapter
democratic
congress
ends
it
would
be
folly
to
say
that
president
wilson
was
not
at
this
time
aware
of
a
very
damning
situation
the
unanswerable
prison
special
special
car
of
women
touring
the
country
from
coast
to
coast
to
keep
the
public
attention
during
the
closing
days
of
the
session
fixed
upon
the
suffrage
situation
in
the
senate
the
prisoners
were
addressing
enormous
meetings
and
arousing
thousands
especially
in
the
south
to
articulate
condemnation
of
administration
tactics
it
is
impossible
to
calculate
the
number
of
cables
which
as
a
result
of
this
sensational
tour
reached
the
president
during
his
deliberations
at
the
peace
table
the
messages
of
protest
which
did
not
reach
the
president
at
the
peace
conference
were
waiting
for
him
on
his
desk
at
the
white
house
even
if
some
conservative
boston
suffragists
did
present
him
with
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
jonquils
tied
with
a
yellow
ribbon
as
their
welcome
home
will
any
one
venture
to
say
that
that
token
of
trust
was
potent
enough
to
wipe
from
his
consciousness
the
other
welcome
which
led
his
welcomers
to
jail
will
any
one
contend
that
president
wilson
upon
his
arrival
in
washington
and
after
changing
his
clothes
piously
remarked
by
the
way
tumulty
i
want
to
show
you
some
jonquils
tied
with
a
yellow
ribbon
that
were
presented
to
me
in
boston
i
am
moved
i
think
i
may
say
deeply
moved
by
this
sincere
tribute
to
do
something
this
morning
for
woman
suffrage
just
what
is
the
state
of
affairs
and
does
there
seem
to
be
any
great
demand
for
it
we
do
not
know
what
if
anything
he
did
say
to
secretary
tumulty
but
we
know
what
he
did
he
hurried
over
to
the
capitol
and
there
made
his
first
official
business
a
conference
with
senator
jones
of
new
mexico
chairman
of
the
senate
suffrage
committee
after
expressing
chagrin
over
the
failure
of
the
measure
in
the
senate
the
president
discussed
ways
and
means
of
getting
it
through
an
immediate
result
of
the
conference
was
the
introduction
in
the
senate
february
by
senator
jones
of
another
resolution
on
suffrage
senator
jones
had
refused
to
reintroduce
the
original
suffrage
resolution
immediately
after
the
senate
defeat
february
now
he
came
forward
with
this
one
a
little
differently
worded
but
to
the
same
purpose
as
the
original
amendment
this
resolution
was
a
concession
to
senator
gay
of
louisiana
democrat
who
had
voted
against
the
measure
on
february
but
who
immediately
pledged
his
vote
in
favor
of
the
new
resolution
thus
the
and
last
vote
was
won
the
majority
instantly
directed
its
efforts
toward
getting
a
vote
on
the
new
resolution
on
march
senator
jones
attempted
to
get
unanimous
consent
to
consider
it
senator
wadsworth
of
new
york
republican
suffragist
objected
when
consent
was
again
asked
the
following
day
senator
weeks
of
massachusetts
republican
objected
on
the
last
day
of
the
session
senator
sherman
of
illinois
republican
suffragist
objected
and
so
the
democratic
congress
ended
without
passing
the
amendment
on
the
face
of
it
these
parliamentary
objections
from
republicans
prevented
action
when
the
democrats
had
finally
this
amendment
although
to
the
same
purpose
as
the
original
amendment
was
not
as
satisfactory
because
of
possible
controversial
points
in
the
enforcement
article
the
original
amendment
is
of
course
crystal
clear
in
this
regard
secured
the
necessary
votes
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
president
and
his
party
were
responsible
for
subjecting
the
amendment
to
the
tactical
obstruction
of
individual
senators
they
waited
until
the
last
three
days
to
make
the
supreme
effort
that
the
president
did
finally
get
the
last
vote
even
at
a
moment
when
parliamentary
difficulties
prevented
it
from
being
voted
upon
proved
our
contention
that
he
could
pass
the
amendment
at
any
time
he
set
himself
resolutely
to
it
this
last
ineffective
effort
also
proved
how
hard
the
president
had
been
pushed
by
our
tactics
but
it
seems
to
me
that
president
wilson
has
a
pathetic
aptitude
for
acting
a
little
too
late
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
southern
contingent
in
his
party
stood
stubbornly
against
him
on
woman
suffrage
was
of
course
a
real
obstacle
but
we
contended
that
the
business
of
a
statesman
who
declared
himself
to
be
a
friend
of
a
measure
was
to
remove
even
real
obstacles
to
the
success
of
that
measure
perhaps
our
standard
was
too
high
it
must
be
confessed
that
people
in
general
are
distressingly
patient
easily
content
with
pronouncements
and
shockingly
inert
about
seeing
to
it
that
political
leaders
act
as
they
speak
we
had
seen
the
president
overcome
far
greater
obstacles
than
stood
in
his
way
on
this
issue
we
had
seen
him
lead
a
country
which
had
voted
to
stay
out
of
the
european
war
into
battle
almost
immediately
after
they
had
so
voted
we
had
seen
him
conscript
the
men
of
the
same
stubborn
south
which
had
been
conspicuously
opposed
to
conscription
we
had
seen
him
win
mothers
to
his
war
point
of
view
after
they
had
fought
passionately
for
him
and
his
peace
program
at
election
time
he
had
taken
pains
to
lead
men
and
women
influential
and
obscure
to
his
way
of
thinking
i
do
not
condemn
respect
him
for
being
able
to
do
this
the
point
is
that
he
dirt
overcome
obstacles
when
his
heart
and
head
were
set
to
the
task
since
our
problem
was
neither
in
his
head
nor
his
heart
it
was
our
task
to
put
it
there
having
got
it
there
it
was
our
responsibility
to
see
that
it
churned
and
churned
there
until
he
had
to
act
we
did
our
utmost
for
six
full
years
through
three
congresses
under
president
wilson
power
the
continual
democratic
resistance
meandering
delays
deceits
had
left
us
still
disfranchised
a
world
war
had
come
and
gone
during
this
span
of
effort
vast
millions
had
died
in
pursuit
of
liberty
a
czar
and
a
kaiser
had
been
deposed
the
russian
people
had
revolutionized
their
whole
social
and
economic
system
and
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
we
could
even
wrest
from
the
leader
of
democracy
and
his
poor
miserable
associates
the
first
step
toward
our
political
passage
of
an
amendment
through
congress
submitting
the
question
of
democracy
to
the
states
what
a
magnificent
thing
it
was
for
those
women
to
rebel
their
solitary
steadfastness
to
their
objective
stands
out
in
this
world
of
confused
ideals
and
half
hearted
actions
clear
and
lonely
and
superb
chapter
a
farewell
to
president
wilson
the
republican
congress
elected
in
november
would
not
sit
until
december
is
our
unfortunate
called
together
by
the
president
in
a
special
session
we
had
polled
the
new
congress
by
personal
interviews
and
by
post
and
found
a
safe
majority
for
the
amendment
in
the
house
in
the
new
senate
we
still
lacked
a
fateful
one
vote
our
task
was
therefore
to
induce
the
president
to
call
a
special
session
of
congress
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
to
see
that
he
did
not
relax
his
efforts
toward
the
last
vote
he
wo
do
it
president
wilson
will
never
let
the
republican
congress
come
together
until
the
regular
time
especially
with
himself
in
europe
the
usual
points
of
objection
were
raised
but
we
persisted
we
felt
that
the
president
could
win
this
last
vote
and
the
fear
that
a
republican
congress
might
if
he
did
not
was
an
accelerating
factor
one
feature
of
the
campaign
to
force
a
special
session
was
a
demonstration
in
new
york
on
the
eve
of
president
return
to
europe
at
the
time
he
addressed
a
mass
meeting
in
the
metropolitan
opera
house
on
behalf
of
his
proposed
league
of
nations
the
plan
of
demonstration
was
to
hold
outside
of
the
opera
house
banners
addressed
to
president
wilson
and
to
consign
his
speech
to
the
flames
of
a
torch
at
a
public
meeting
nearby
it
was
a
clear
starry
night
in
march
when
the
picket
line
of
women
proceeded
with
banners
from
new
york
headquarters
in
street
to
the
opera
house
as
we
neared
the
corner
of
the
street
opposite
the
opera
house
and
before
we
could
cross
the
street
a
veritable
battalion
of
policemen
in
close
formation
rushed
us
with
unbelievable
ferocity
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
a
single
officer
of
the
two
hundred
policemen
in
the
attack
to
indicate
the
nature
of
our
offense
clubs
were
raised
and
lowered
and
the
women
beaten
back
with
such
cruelty
as
none
of
us
had
ever
witnessed
before
the
women
clung
to
their
heavy
banner
poles
trying
to
keep
the
banners
above
the
maelstrom
but
the
police
seized
them
tore
the
pennants
broke
the
poles
some
of
them
over
our
backs
trampled
them
underfoot
pounded
us
dragged
us
and
in
every
way
behaved
like
frantic
beasts
it
would
have
been
so
simple
quietly
to
detain
our
little
handful
until
after
the
president
speech
if
that
seemed
necessary
but
to
launch
this
violent
attack
under
the
circumstances
was
madness
not
a
pedestrian
had
paid
any
except
friendly
attention
to
the
slender
file
of
women
but
the
moment
this
happened
an
enormous
crowd
gathered
made
up
mostly
of
soldiers
and
sailors
many
of
whom
had
just
returned
from
abroad
and
were
temporarily
thronging
the
streets
of
new
york
they
joined
forces
with
the
police
in
the
attack
miss
margaretta
schuyler
a
beautiful
fragile
young
girl
was
holding
fast
a
silken
american
flag
which
she
had
carried
at
the
head
of
the
procession
when
a
uniformed
soldier
jumped
upon
her
twisted
her
arms
until
she
cried
in
pain
cursed
struggled
until
he
had
torn
her
flag
from
its
pole
and
then
broke
the
pole
across
her
head
exulting
in
his
triumph
over
his
frailer
victim
when
i
appealed
to
the
policeman
who
was
at
the
moment
occupied
solely
with
pounding
me
on
the
back
to
intercept
the
soldier
in
his
cruel
attack
his
only
reply
was
oh
helping
me
he
thereupon
resumed
his
beating
of
me
and
i
cried
shame
shame
are
you
ashamed
to
beat
american
women
in
this
brutal
way
i
offered
no
other
resistance
if
we
are
breaking
any
law
arrest
us
do
beat
us
in
this
cowardly
fashion
we
rush
you
like
bulls
was
his
vulgar
answer
we
only
just
begun
another
young
woman
an
aviatrice
was
seized
by
the
coat
collar
and
thrown
to
the
pavement
for
trying
to
keep
hold
of
her
banner
her
fur
cap
was
the
only
thing
that
saved
her
skull
from
serious
injury
as
it
was
she
was
trampled
under
foot
and
her
face
severely
cut
before
we
could
rescue
her
with
the
assistance
of
a
sympathetic
member
of
the
crowd
the
sympathetic
person
was
promptly
attacked
by
the
policeman
for
helping
his
victim
to
her
feet
there
were
many
shouts
of
disapproval
of
the
police
conduct
and
many
cheers
for
the
women
from
the
dense
crowd
by
this
time
the
crowd
had
massed
itself
so
thickly
that
we
could
hardly
move
an
inch
it
was
perfectly
apparent
that
we
could
neither
make
our
way
to
the
opera
house
nor
could
we
extricate
ourselves
but
the
terrors
continued
women
were
knocked
down
and
trampled
under
foot
some
of
them
almost
unconscious
others
bleeding
from
the
hands
and
face
arms
were
bruised
and
twisted
pocketbooks
were
snatched
and
stolen
when
it
looked
as
if
the
suffocating
melee
would
result
in
the
death
or
permanent
injury
to
some
of
us
i
was
at
last
dragged
by
a
policeman
to
the
edge
of
the
crowd
although
i
offered
not
the
slightest
resistance
i
was
crushed
continuously
in
the
arm
by
the
officer
who
walked
me
to
the
police
station
and
kept
muttering
you
a
bunch
of
cannibals
cannibals
upon
arriving
at
the
police
station
i
was
happily
relieved
to
find
eve
of
my
comrades
already
there
we
were
all
impartially
cursed
at
told
to
stand
up
told
to
sit
down
forbidden
to
speak
to
one
another
forbidden
even
to
smile
at
one
another
one
by
one
we
were
called
to
the
desk
to
give
our
name
age
and
various
other
pieces
of
information
we
stood
perfectly
silent
before
the
station
lieutenant
as
he
coaxingly
said
you
better
tell
you
better
give
us
your
name
you
better
tell
us
where
you
will
make
things
easier
for
you
but
we
continued
our
silence
disorderly
conduct
interfering
with
the
police
assaulting
the
police
shades
of
heaven
assaulting
the
police
were
the
charges
entered
against
us
we
were
all
locked
in
separate
cells
and
told
that
we
would
be
taken
to
the
woman
night
court
for
immediate
trial
while
pondering
on
what
was
happening
to
our
comrades
and
wondering
if
they
too
would
be
arrested
or
if
they
would
just
be
beaten
up
by
the
police
and
mob
a
large
fat
jail
matron
came
up
and
began
to
deliver
a
speech
which
ran
something
like
this
now
shure
and
you
ladies
must
know
that
this
is
goin
a
bit
too
far
now
i
for
suffrage
alright
and
i
believe
women
ought
to
vote
but
why
do
you
keep
botherin
the
president
do
you
know
he
has
got
enough
to
think
about
with
the
league
of
nations
the
peace
conference
and
fixin
up
the
whole
world
on
his
mind
in
about
half
an
hour
we
were
taken
from
our
cells
and
brought
before
the
lieutenant
who
now
announced
well
you
ladies
may
go
now
have
just
received
a
telephone
order
to
release
you
we
accepted
the
news
and
jubilantly
left
the
station
house
returning
at
once
to
our
comrades
there
the
battle
was
still
going
on
and
as
we
joined
them
we
were
again
dragged
and
cuffed
about
the
streets
by
the
police
and
their
aids
but
there
were
no
more
arrests
elsie
hill
succeeded
in
speaking
from
a
balcony
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
did
you
men
turn
back
when
you
saw
the
germans
coming
what
would
you
have
thought
of
any
one
who
did
did
you
expect
us
to
turn
back
we
never
turn
back
either
and
we
wo
until
democracy
is
won
who
rolled
bandages
for
you
when
you
were
suffering
abroad
who
bound
your
wounds
in
your
fight
for
democracy
who
spent
long
hours
of
the
night
and
the
day
knitting
you
warm
garments
there
are
women
here
attempting
to
hold
banners
to
remind
the
president
that
democracy
is
not
won
at
home
who
have
given
their
sons
and
husbands
for
your
fight
abroad
what
would
they
say
if
they
could
see
you
their
comrades
in
the
fight
over
there
attacking
their
mothers
their
sisters
their
wives
over
here
are
you
ashamed
that
you
have
not
enough
sporting
blood
to
allow
us
to
make
our
fight
in
our
own
way
are
you
ashamed
that
you
accepted
the
help
of
women
in
your
fight
and
now
brutally
attack
them
and
they
did
listen
until
the
police
in
now
like
wooden
from
both
sides
of
the
street
and
succeeded
in
entirely
cutting
off
the
crowd
from
miss
hill
the
meeting
thus
broken
up
we
abandoned
a
further
attempt
that
night
as
our
little
bannerless
procession
filed
slowly
back
to
headquarters
hoodlums
followed
us
the
police
of
course
gave
us
no
protection
and
just
as
we
were
entering
the
door
of
our
own
building
a
rowdy
struck
me
on
the
side
of
the
head
with
a
heavy
banner
pole
the
blow
knocked
me
senseless
against
the
stone
building
my
hat
was
snatched
from
my
head
and
burned
in
the
street
we
entered
the
building
to
find
that
soldiers
and
sailors
had
been
periodically
rushing
it
in
our
absence
dragging
out
bundles
of
our
banners
amounting
to
many
hundreds
of
dollars
and
burning
them
in
the
street
without
any
protest
from
the
police
one
does
not
undergo
such
an
experience
without
arriving
at
some
inescapable
truths
a
discussion
of
which
would
interest
me
deeply
but
which
would
be
irrelevant
in
this
narrative
two
hundred
maddened
women
try
to
see
the
president
two
hundred
women
attack
the
police
and
similar
false
headlines
appeared
the
next
morning
in
the
new
york
papers
it
hurt
to
have
the
world
think
that
we
had
attacked
the
police
that
was
a
slight
matter
however
for
that
morning
at
breakfast
aboard
the
george
washington
the
president
also
read
the
new
york
papers
he
saw
that
we
were
not
submitting
in
silence
to
his
inaction
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
on
sailing
down
the
harbor
that
morning
past
the
statue
of
liberty
the
president
had
some
trouble
to
banish
from
his
mind
the
report
that
two
hundred
maddened
women
had
tried
to
make
the
opera
house
last
night
chapter
president
wilson
wins
the
vote
in
paris
the
prison
special
which
was
nearing
the
end
of
its
dramatic
tour
was
arousing
the
people
to
call
for
a
special
session
of
congress
as
the
president
sailed
away
although
a
republican
congress
had
been
elected
president
wilson
as
the
head
of
the
administration
was
still
responsible
for
initiating
and
guiding
legislation
we
had
to
see
to
it
that
with
his
congress
out
of
power
he
did
not
relax
his
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
amendment
there
was
this
situation
which
we
were
able
to
use
to
our
advantage
two
new
democratic
senators
senator
harrison
of
mississippi
and
senator
harris
of
georgia
had
been
elected
to
sit
in
the
incoming
congress
through
the
president
influence
he
therefore
had
very
specific
power
over
these
two
men
who
were
neither
committed
against
suffrage
by
previous
votes
nor
were
they
yet
won
to
the
amendment
we
immediately
set
ourselves
to
the
task
of
getting
the
president
to
win
one
of
these
men
from
the
election
of
these
two
men
in
the
autumn
to
early
spring
constant
pressure
was
put
upon
the
president
to
this
end
when
we
could
see
no
activity
on
the
part
of
the
president
to
secure
the
support
of
one
of
them
we
again
threatened
publicly
to
resume
dramatic
protests
against
him
we
kept
the
idea
abroad
that
he
was
still
responsible
and
that
we
would
continue
to
hold
him
so
until
the
amendment
was
passed
such
a
situation
gave
friends
of
the
administration
siderable
alarm
they
realized
that
the
slightest
attack
on
the
president
at
that
moment
would
jeopardize
his
many
other
endeavors
and
so
these
friends
of
the
president
undertook
to
acquaint
him
with
the
facts
senator
harris
was
happily
in
europe
at
the
time
a
most
anxious
cable
signed
by
politicians
in
his
own
party
was
sent
to
the
president
in
paris
explaining
the
serious
situation
and
urging
him
to
do
his
utmost
to
secure
the
vote
of
the
senator
at
once
senator
harris
was
in
italy
when
he
received
an
unexpected
telegram
asking
him
to
come
to
paris
he
journeyed
with
all
speed
to
the
president
perhaps
even
thinking
that
he
was
about
to
be
dispatched
to
some
foreign
post
to
learn
that
the

purpose
of
securing
his
vote
on

national
suffrage
amendment
senator
harris
there
and
then
gave
his
vote
the
vote
on
that
day
the
passage
by
congress
of
the
original
susan
anthony
amendment
was
assured
instantly
a
cable
was
received
at
the
white
house
carrying
news
to
the
suffragists
of
the
final
capture
of
the
elusive
last
vote
following
immediately
on
the
heels
of
this
cable
came
another
cable
calling
the
new
congress
into
special
session
may
in
the
light
of
the
president
gradual
yielding
and
final
surrender
to
our
demand
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
summarize
briefly
just
what
happened
president
wilson
began
his
career
as
president
of
the
united
states
an
he
was
opposed
to
suffrage
for
women
both
by
principle
and
political
expediency
sometimes
i
think
he
regarded
suffragists
as
a
kind
of
women
no
doubt
but
tiresome
and
troublesome
whether
he
has
yet
come
to
see
the
suffrage
battle
as
part
of
a
great
movement
embracing
the
world
is
still
a
question
it
is
not
an
important
question
for
in
any
case
it
was
not
inward
conviction
but
political
necessity
that
made
him
act
believing
then
that
suffragists
were
a
sect
he
said
many
things
to
them
at
first
with
no
particular
care
as
to
the
bearing
of
these
things
upon
political
theory
or
events
he
offered
successively
consideration
an
open
mind
a
closed
mind
and
conviction
deeply
matured
party
limitations
party
concert
of
action
and
what
not
he
saw
in
suffrage
the
tide
rising
to
meet
the
moon
but
waited
and
advised
us
to
wait
with
him
but
we
did
not
want
to
wait
and
we
proceeded
to
try
to
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
wait
either
we
determined
to
make
action
upon
this
issue
politically
expedient
for
him
when
the
president
began
to
perceive
the
potential
political
power
of
women
voters
he
first
declared
as
a
private
citizen
that
suffrage
was
all
right
for
the
women
of
his
home
state
new
jersey
but
that
it
was
altogether
wrong
to
ask
him
as
president
to
assist
in
bringing
it
about
for
all
the
women
of
the
nation
he
also
interested
himself
in
writing
the
suffrage
plank
in
the
democratic
party
national
platform
specifically
relegating
action
on
suffrage
to
the
states
then
he
calmly
announced
that
he
could
not
act
nationally
even
if
i
wanted
to
because
the
platform
had
spoken
otherwise
the
controversy
was
lengthened
the
president
conspicuous
ability
for
sitting
still
and
doing
nothing
on
a
controversial
issue
until
both
sides
have
exhausted
their
ammunition
was
never
better
illustrated
than
in
this
matter
he
allowed
the
controversy
to
continue
to
the
point
of
intellectual
sterility
he
buttressed
his
delays
with
more
evasions
until
finally
the
women
intensified
their
demand
for
action
they
picketed
his
official
gates
but
the
president
still
recoiled
from
action
so
mightily
did
he
recoil
from
it
that
he
was
willing
to
imprison
women
for
demanding
it
it
is
not
extraordinary
to
resent
being
called
upon
to
act
for
it
is
only
the
exceptional
person
who
springs
to
action
even
when
action
is
admitted
to
be
desirable
and
necessary
and
the
president
is
not
exceptional
he
is
surprisingly
ordinary
while
the
women
languished
in
prison
he
fell
back
upon
beautiful
words
too
expressions
of
friendliness
good
wishes
hopes
and
in
this
too
he
was
acting
like
an
ordinary
human
being
not
like
the
statesman
he
was
reputed
to
be
he
had
habituated
himself
to
a
belief
in
the
power
of
words
and
every
time
he
uttered
them
to
us
he
seemed
to
refortify
himself
in
his
belief
in
their
power
it
was
the
women
not
the
president
who
were
exceptional
they
refused
to
accept
words
they
persisted
in
demanding
acts
step
by
step
under
terrific
gunfire
the
president
resistance
crumbled
and
he
yielded
one
by
one
every
minor
facility
to
the
measure
always
withholding
from
us
however
the
main
objective
not
until
he
had
exhausted
all
minor
facilities
and
all
possible
evasions
did
he
publicly
declare
that
the
amendment
should
pass
the
house
and
put
it
through
when
he
had
done
that
we
rested
from
the
attack
momentarily
in
order
to
let
him
consummate
with
grace
and
not
under
fire
the
passage
of
the
amendment
in
the
senate
he
rested
altogether
we
were
therefore
compelled
to
renew
the
attack
he
countered
at
first
with
more
words
but
his
reliance
upon
them
was
perceptibly
shaken
when
we
burned
them
in
public
bonfires
he
then
moved
feebly
but
with
a
growing
concern
toward
getting
additional
votes
in
the
senate
and
when
as
an
inevitable
result
of
his
political
embarrassment
became
too
acute
calling
into
question
his
honor
and
prestige
he
covertly
began
to
consult
his
colleagues
we
pushed
him
the
harder
he
moved
the
faster
toward
concrete
endeavor
he
actually
undertook
to
win
the
final
votes
in
the
senate
there
he
found
however
that
quite
an
alarming
situation
had
situation
which
he
should
have
anticipated
but
for
which
he
was
totally
unprepared
opposition
in
his
own
party
had
been
growing
more
and
more
rigid
and
cynical
his
own
opposition
to
the
amendment
his
grant
of
immunity
to
those
leaders
in
his
party
who
had
fought
the
measure
his
isolating
himself
from
those
who
might
have
this
was
coming
to
fruition
among
his
subordinates
at
a
time
when
he
could
least
afford
to
be
beaten
on
anything
what
would
have
been
a
fairly
easy
race
to
win
if
he
had
begun
running
at
the
pistol
shot
had
now
become
most
difficult
perceiving
that
he
had
now
not
only
to
move
himself
but
also
to
overcome
the
obstacle
which
he
had
allowed
to
develop
we
increased
the
energy
of
our
attack
and
finally
the
president
made
a
supreme
assertion
of
his
power
and
secured
the
last
and
vote
in
the
senate
he
did
this
too
late
to
get
the
any
advantage
is
to
be
gained
from
granting
a
just
thing
at
the
point
of
a
this
last
vote
arrived
only
in
time
for
a
republican
congress
to
use
it
it
seems
to
me
that
woodrow
wilson
was
neither
devil
nor
god
in
his
manner
of
meeting
the
demand
of
the
suffragists
there
has
persisted
an
astounding
myth
that
he
is
an
extraordinary
man
our
experience
proved
the
contrary
he
behaved
toward
us
like
a
very
ordinary
politician
unnecessarily
cruel
or
weakly
tolerant
according
as
you
view
the
justice
of
our
fight
but
a
politician
not
a
statesman
he
did
not
go
out
to
meet
the
tide
which
he
himself
perceived
was
rising
to
meet
the
moon
that
would
have
been
statesmanship
he
let
it
all
but
engulf
him
before
he
acted
and
even
as
a
politician
he
failed
for
his
tactics
resulted
in
the
passage
of
the
amendment
by
a
republican
congress
chapter
republican

passes
amendment
the
republican

convened
in
special
session
may
instantly
republican
leaders
in
control
of
the
congress
caucused
and
organized
for
a
prompt
passage
of
the
amendment
may
the
republican
house
of
representatives
passed
the
measure
by
a
vote
of
to
first
thing
of
any
importance
done
by
the
new
house
this
was
votes
above
the
required
majority
whereas
the
vote
in
the
house
in
january
under
democratic
control
had
given
the
measure
only
one
vote
more
than
was
required
immediately
the
democratic
national
committee
passed
a
resolution
calling
on
the
legislatures
of
the
various
states
to
hold
special
legislative
sessions
where
necessary
to
ratify
the
amendment
as
soon
as
it
was
through
congress
in
order
to
enable
women
to
vote
in
the
national
elections
of
when
the
vote
was
assured
two
more
republican
senators
announced
their
support
senator
keyes
of
new
hampshire
and
senator
hale
of
maine
and
on
june
the
measure
passed
the
senate
by
a
vote
of
to
votes
more
than
needed
l
of
the
republicans
in
the
senate
voted
for
the
amendment
against
of
the
democrats
in
the
senate
voted
for
it
and
against
and
so
the
assertion
that
the
right
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
vote
shall
not
be
denied
or
abridged
by
the
these
figures
include
all
voting
and
paired
united
states
or
by
any
state
on
account
of
sex
introduced
into
congress
by
the
efforts
of
susan
anthony
in
was
finally
submitted
to
the
states
for
ratification
on
june
i
do
not
need
to
explain
that
the
amendment
was
not
won
from
the
republican
congress
between
may
and
june
the
republican
party
had
been
gradually
coming
to
appreciate
this
opportunity
throughout
our
entire
national
agitation
from
to
date
and
our
attack
upon
the
party
in
power
which
happened
to
be
president
wilson
party
had
been
the
most
decisive
factor
in
stimulating
the
opposition
party
to
espouse
our
side
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
for
the
republican
party
that
it
was
their
political
opponents
who
inherited
this
lively
question
in
however
the
political
advantage
is
theirs
for
having
promptly
and
ungrudgingly
passed
the
amendment
the
moment
they
came
into
power
but
it
will
not
be
surprising
to
any
one
who
has
read
this
book
that
i
conclude
by
pointing
out
that
the
real
triumph
belongs
to
the
women
our
objective
was
the
national
enfranchisement
of
women
a
tiny
step
you
may
say
true
but
so
long
as
we
know
that
this
is
but
the
first
step
in
the
long
struggle
of
women
for
political
economic
and
social
emancipation
we
need
not
be
disturbed
if
political
institutions
as
we
know
them
in
their
discredited
condition
break
down
and
another
kind
of
them
women
will
battle
for
their
place
in
the
new
system
with
as
much
determination
as
they
have
shown
in
the
struggle
just
ended
that
women
have
been
aroused
never
again
to
be
content
with
their
subjection
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
will
ultimately
secure
for
themselves
equal
power
and
responsibility
when
a
constitutional
amendment
has
passed
congress
it
must
be
ratified
by
a
majority
vote
of
state
legislatures
and
thereupon
proclaimed
operative
by
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
before
it
becomes

law

the
land
for
ratification
data
see
appendix
in
whatever
system
of
government
is
evolved
is
positive
how
revolutionary
will
be
the
changes
when
women
get
this
power
and
responsibility
no
one
can
adequately
foretell
one
thing
is
certain
they
will
not
go
back
they
will
never
again
be
good
and
willing
slaves
it
has
been
a
long
wearying
struggle
although
drudgery
has
persisted
throughout
there
have
been
compensatory
moments
of
great
joy
and
beauty
the
relief
that
comes
after
a
great
achievement
is
sweet
there
is
no
residue
of
bitterness
to
be
sure
women
have
often
resented
it
deeply
that
so
much
human
energy
had
to
be
expended
for
so
simple
a
right
but
whatever
disillusionments
they
have
experienced
they
have
kept
their
faith
in
women
and
the
winning
of
political
power
by
women
will
have
enormously
elevated
their
status

they
came
defenseless
upon
the
streets
adjoining
as
well
as
when
they
were
in
the
said
building
and
whereas
the
organized
police
of
the
city
of
washington
district
of
columbia
made
no
attempt
to
properly
safeguard
the
property
and
persons
of
the
said
defenseless
women
but
on
the
contrary
said
police
even
seemed
to
encourage
the
lawless
acts
of
the
mob
and
whereas
such
lawlessness
is
in
the
capital
of
the
united
states
and
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
executive
mansion
and
offices
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
whereas
these
attacks
upon
defenseless
women
are
not
only
an
outrage
and
crime
in
themselves
that
prove
the
perpetrators
and
those
lending
aid
to
the
same
to
be
cowards
but
in
addition
create
throughout
the
world
contempt
for
the
united
states
and
set
a
vicious
example
to
the
people
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
world
at
large
of
lawlessness
and
violence
and
encourage
designing
cowards
and
manipulators
everywhere
to
form
mobs
to
molest
the
innocent
and
defenseless
under
any
pretext
whatever
and
whereas
there
seems
to
be
no
activity
or
attempt
on
the
part
of
any
one
in
authority
in
the
city
of
washington
district
of
columbia
nor
by
the
government
officials
to
apprehend
arrest
or
punish
those
perpetrating
the
violence
on
account
of
which
the
same
may
occur
indefinitely
unless
congress
acts
in
the
premises
and
whereas
the
legal
status
upon
the
premises
stated
would
excuse
the
occupants
of
the
cameron
house
if
they
were
so
disposed
in
firing
upon
the
mobs
aforesaid
and
thus
create
a
state
of
greater
violence
and
unlawless
to
further
injure
the
prestige
and
good
name
of
the
united
states
for
maintaining
law
and
order
and
institutions
of
democracy
therefore
be
it
resolved
that
the
speaker
appoint
a
committee
of
seven
members
to
investigate
into
all
the
facts
relating
to
the
violence
and
unlawful
acts
aforesaid
and
make
the
earliest
possible
report
upon
the
conditions
with
the
purpose
in
view
of
purging
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
and
other
official
departments
of
all
lawless
men
who
bring
disgrace
upon
the
american
flag
by
participating
in
mob
violence
and
also
to
inquire
regarding
the
conduct
of
all
government
employees
and

police
of
the
city

appendix
concerning
political
prisoners
definitions
james
bryce
perhaps
we
may
say
that
whenever
the
moral
judgment
of
the
community
at
large
does
not
brand
an
offence
as
sordid
and
degrading
and
does
not
feel
the
offence
to
be
one
which
destroys
its
respect
for
the
personal
character
of
the
prisoner
it
may
there
be
held
that
prison
treatment
ought
to
be
different
from
that
awarded
to
ordinary
criminals
george
sigerson
men
may
differ
in
thought
and
deed
on
many
questions
without
moral
guilt
forms
of
government
and
measures
relating
to
the
welfare
and
organization
of
society
have
been
in
all
ages
and
countries
questions
on
which
men
have
entertained
divergent
convictions
and
asserted
their
sincerity
by
conflicting
action
often
at
grave
personal
sacrifice
and
the
loss
of
life
on
the
other
hand
all
people
are
agreed
in
condemning
certain
acts
stigmatized
as
crimes
which
offend
against
the
of
the
individual
or
the
community
hence
civilized
states
distinguish
between
actions
concerning
which
good
men
may
reasonably
differ
and
actions
james
bryce
made
this
distinction
in
between
the
two
kinds
of
offenders
letter
introductory
to
political
prisoners
at
home
and
abroad
sigerson
political
prisoners
at
home
and
abroad
which
all
good
men
condemn
the
latter
if
permitted
to
prevail
would
disintegrate
and
destroy
the
social
life
of
mankind
the
former
if
successful
would
simply
reorganize
it
on
a
different
basis
the
objects
may
in
one
generation
be
branded
as
crimes
whilst
in
the
next
those
who
fail
to
make
them
triumph
and
suffered
as
malefactors
are
exalted
as
patriot
martyrs
and
their
principles
incorporated
amongst
the
foundation
principles
of
the
country
constitution
attempts
to
effect
changes
by
methods
beyond
the
conventions
which
have
the
sanction
of
the
majority
of
a
community
may
be
rash
and
blameworthy
sometimes
but
they
are
not
necessarily
dishonorable
and
may
even
occasionally
be
obligatory
on
conscience
as
to
the
incumbency
upon
a
government
to
differentiate
in
punishments
inflicted
upon
these
two
classes
of
offenders
he
further
says
when
a
government
exercises
its
punitive
power
it
should
in
awarding
sentence
distinguish
between
the
two
classes
of
offenders
to
confound
in
a
common
degradation
those
who
violate
the
moral
law
by
acts
which
all
men
condemn
and
those
who
offend
against
the
established
order
of
society
by
acts
of
which
many
men
approve
and
for
objects
which
may
sometime
be
accepted
as
integral
parts
of
established
order
is
manifestly
wrong
in
principle
it
places
a
government
morally
in
the
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
masses
of
the
population
a
thing
to
be
sedulously
guarded
against
george
clemenceau
theoretically
a
crime
committed
in
the
interest
of
the
criminal
is
a
common
law
crime
while
an
offense
committed
in
the
public
interest
is
a
political
crime
he
says
further
that
an
act
isolated
from
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
committed
may
have
the
appearance
of
a
common
clemenceau
in
a
speech
before
the
french
chamber
of
deputies
may
advocating
amnesty
for
those
who
participated
in

law
crime
while
viewed
in
connection
with
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
committed
in
connection
with
a
movement
it
may
take
on
a
political
character
maurice
parmelee
common
crimes
are
acts
contrary
to
the
law
committed
in
the
interest
of
the
individual
criminal
or
of
those
personally
related
to
the
criminal
political
crimes
are
acts
contrary
to
the
law
committed
against
an
existing
government
or
form
of
government
in
the
interest
of
another
government
or
form
of
government
furthermore
there
are
other
offenses
against
the
law
which
are
not
common
crimes
and
yet
are
not
political
crimes
in
the
usual
criminological
sense
among
these
crimes
which
are
broader
than
the
ordinary
political
crimes
are
offenses
in
defense
of
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
and
belief
in
defense
of
the
right
to
express
self
in
words
in
free
speech
and
many
illegal
acts
committed
by
conscientious
objectors
to
the
payment
of
taxes
or
to
military
service
the
offenses
of
laborers
in
strikes
and
other
labor
disturbances
the
violations
of
law
committed
by
those
who
are
trying
to
bring
about
changes
in
the
relations
between
the
sexes
etc
common
crimes
are
almost
invariably
in
their
nature
while
offenses
which
are
directly
or
indirectly
political
are
usually
social
in
their
intent
and
are
frequently
beneficial
to
society
in
their
ultimate
effect
we
are
therefore
justified
in
calling
them
social
crimes

the

treatment

prisonfrs
abroad
it
is
interesting
to
note
what
other
countries
have
done
toward
handling
intelligently
the
problem
of
political
offenders
russia
was
probably
the
first
country
in
modern
history
to
recognize
political
prisoners
as
a
class
although
the
treatment
of
different
groups
and
individuals
varied
widely
first
of
all
the
political
offender
was
recognized
as
a
not
by
law
but
by
custom
when
sure
of
a
verdict
of
guilty
either
through
damaging
evidence
or
a
packed
jury
the
offender
was
tried
when
it
was
impossible
to
commit
him
to
trial
because
there
were
no
proofs
against
him
administrative
exile
was
resorted
to
these
judgments
or
administrative
orders
to
exile
were
pronounced
in
secret
on
political
offenders
one
member
of
the
family
of
the
defendant
was
admitted
to
the
trial
under
the
law
of
those
exiled
by
administrative
order
were
transported
in
cars
but
stopped
en
route
at
the
etapes
political
prisoners
along
with
common
law
convicts
since
politicals
condemned
by
the
courts
to
hard
labor
or
to
exile
journeyed
on
foot
with
common
law
convicts
there
were
no
hospitals
for
political
exiles
doctors
and
surgeons
among
the
exiled
helped
their
sick
comrades
families
were
permitted
to
follow
the
loved
ones
into
exile
if
they
chose
for
example
wives
were
allowed
to
stay
at
lower
kara
and
visit
their
husbands
in
the
prison
in
middle
kara
twice
a
week
and
to
bring
them
books
when
criminal
convicts
were
freed
in
siberia
after
serving
a
given
sentence
at
hard
labor
they
received
an
allotment
of
land
and
agricultural
implements
for
purposes
of
sustenance
and
after
two
years
the
government
troubled
no
more
about
siberia
received
its
first
exiles
in
the
century
them
they
became
settlers
in
some
province
of
southern
siberia
with
political
exiles
it
was
quite
different
when
they
had
finished
a
seven
ten
or
twelve
year
sentence
they
were
not
liberated
but
transferred
to
the
tundras
within
the
arctic
circle
fancy
a
young
girl
student
exiled
to
a
village
numbering
a
hundred
houses
with
the

allowance
of
to
shillings
a
month
to
live
on
occupations
were
closed
to
her
and
there
was
no
opportunity
to
learn
a
trade
she
was
forbidden
to
leave
the
town
even
for
a
few
hours
the
villagers
were
for
the
most
part
in
fear
of
being
suspected
if
seen
to
greet
politicals
in
the
street
without
dress
without
shoes
living
in
the
nastiest
huts
without
any
occupation
they
the
exiles
were
mostly
dying
from
consumption
said
the
golos
of
february
they
lived
in
constant
fear
of
starvation
and
the
government
allowance
was
withdrawn
if
it
became
known
that
an
exile
received
any
monetary
assistance
from
family
or
friends
those
politicals
condemned
to
hard
labor
in
siberia
worked
mostly
in
gold
mines
for
three
months
out
of
twelve
during
which
period
meat
was
added
to
their
diet
otherwise
black
bread
was
the
main
food
of
the
diet
when
held
in
prisons
awaiting
trial
or
convicted
and
awaiting
transfer
into
exile
politicals
did
no
work
whatever
their
only
occupation
was
reading
common
criminals
had
to
work
in
prison
as
well
as
in
siberia
in
the
fortress
of
sts
peter
and
paul
kropotkin
was
lodged
in
a
cell
big
enough
to
shelter
a
big
fortress
gun
feet
on
the
diagonal
the
walls
and
floor
were
lined
with
felt
to
prevent
communication
with
others
the
silence
in
these
covered
cells
is
that
of
a
grave
wrote
kropotkin
here
i
wrote
my
two
volumes
on
the
glacial
period
here
in
the
trubeskoi
bastion
one
building
in
the
fortress
he
also
prepared
maps
and
drawings
this
privilege
was
only
granted
to
him
however
after
a
strong
movement
amongst
influential
circles
compelled
it
from
the
czar
the
graphical
society
for
whom
he
was
writing
his
thesis
also
made
many
pleas
on
his
behalf
he
was
allowed
to
buy
tobacco
writing
paper
and
to
have
no
extra
food
kropotkin
says
that
political
prisoners
were
not
subjected
to
corporal
punishment
through
official
fear
of
bloodshed
but
he
must
mean
by
corporal
punishment
actual
beatings
for
he
says
also
the
black
holes
the
chains
the
riveting
to
bar
rows
are
usual
punishments
and
some
politicals
were
leged
to
have
been
put
in
oubliettes
in
the
alexis
ravelin
which
must
have
been
the
worst
feature
of
all
the
tortures
this
meant
immurement
alive
in
cells
in
a
remote
spot
where
no
contact
with
others
was
possible
and
where
the
prisoner
would
often
be
chained
or
riveted
for
years
more
recently
there
was
some
mitigation
of
the
worst
tures
of
the
prison
regime
and
some
additional
privileges
were
extended
to
politicals
all
this
applied
to
old
russia
there
is
no
documentary
proof
available
yet
as
to
how
soviet
russia
treats
its
offenders
against
the
present
government
the
constitution
of
the
sian
socialist
federated
soviet
republic
does
not
provide
a
status
for
political
prisoners
but
it
does
provide
for
their
re
lease
it
specifically
deals
with
amnesty
which
is
proof
of
the
importance
with
which
it
regards
the
question
of
political
offenders
it
says
the
central
executive
com
mittee
deal
with
questions
of

as
the
right
to

it
is
generally
understood
that
for

the
loss
of

the
forced
inactivity
are
in
themselves
so
hard
that
there
is
no

six

an
offensive
article
in

such
is
the
liberty
allowed
a
political
that
while
serving
this
sentence
he
was
given
paper
and
materials
with
which
to
write
another
objectionable
article
called
la
societe
mourante
et
for
the
publication
of
which
he
received
another
six
months
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
comparatively
light
sentences
political
offenders
get
in
france
and
then
there
is
an
established
practice
of
amnesty
they
rarely
finish
out
their
terms
agitation
for
their
release
extends
from
the
extreme

the

distinguishes
between

are

a
friend
of
serrati
the
of
the
italian
journal

proletario
tells
me
that
serrati
was
a
political
prisoner
during
the
late

that
he
was
sentenced
to
three
and
a
half
years
but
was
released
at
the
end
of
six
months
through
pressure
from
the
outside
but
while
there
he
was
allowed
to
write
an
article
a
day
for
avanti
of
which
paper
he
was
then
an
editor
even
before
the
war
german
principalities
recognized
political
offenders
as
such
the
practice
continued
after
the
federation
of
german
states
through
the
empire
and
up
to
the
overthrow
of
kaiser
wilhelm
politicals
were
held
in
honorable
custody
in
fortresses
where
they
were
deprived
only
of
their
liberty
for

activities
in

in

was
arrested
taken
to

later
to

here
he
was

he
was
allowed
to

he
could
converse
with
his
fellow

and
could

receive
numerous
letters
in

he
wrote
that
he
was
occupied
in

was
enjoying

they
treat
me

i
am
told
the

under

the

provides

the

amnesties
require
a
national
law
in
the
scandinavian
countries
there
is
no
provision
for

consideration
of

although
a
proposed
my
life
august
bebel
article
change
in
sweden
penal
laws
now
pending
includes
special
treatment
for
them
and
in
denmark
although
politicals
are
not
recognized
apart
from
other
prisoners
the
people
have
just
won
an
amnesty
for
all
prisoners
convicted
of
political
offense
as
i
write
neither
switzerland
nor
spain
makes
separate
provision
for
politicals
although
there
are
many
prisoners
confined
in
their
prisons
for
political
offenses
especially
in
spain
where
there
are
nearly
always
actually
thousands
in
monjuich
portugal
also
subjects
political

to
the

regime
as

concerning
turkey

i
appealed

a
bulgarian
revolutionist
who
as
protege
of
king
ferdinand
was
educated
at
sofia
and
constantinople
knowing
his
knowledge
on
this
point
would
be
authentic
he
writes
turkey
which
is
the
most
backward
of
all
modern
states
recognized
the
status
of
political
prisoners
before
or
shortly
after
the
armenian
massacres
thousands
of
bulgarian
greek
armenian
and
arabian
insurgents
caught
with
arms
in
their
hands
conspiring
and
actually
in
open
rebellion
against
the
ottoman
empire
were
sentenced
to
exile
or
hard
labor
but
were
never
confined
in
the
same
prisons
with
ordinary
criminals
and
felons
they
were
put
in
more
hygienical
prisons
where
they
were
allowed
to
read
and
write
and
to
breathe
fresh
air
among
some
of
my
friends
who
were
exiled
to
turkish
africa
for
rebellion
was
a
young
scholar
paul
shateff
by
name
who
while
there
wrote
a
remarkable
monograph
on
the
ethnology
and
ethnography
of
the
arabian
tribes
in
which
he
incidentally
tells
of
the
special
treatment
given
him
and
his
fellow
exiles
as
political
prisoners
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
political
wisdom
of
the
sultans
amnesty
is
an
established
practice
usually
at
the
birthday
of
the
sultan
or
the
coming
to
power
of
a
new
sultan
or
on
ramadan
a
national
holiday
in
when
the
young
turks
assumed
control
of
the
government
all
political
prisoners
were
released
and
cared
for
by
the
state
my
friend
paul
shateff
was
sent
at
state
expense
to
bruxelles
to
finish
his
studies
bulgaria
another
one
of
those
countries
established
the
political
regime
even
earlier
than
turkey
politicals
are
allowed
to
read
to
write
books
or
articles
for
publication
to
receive
food
from
outside
and
are
periodically
released
on
amnesty
and
now
we
come
to
england
in
general
england
too
political
offenders
much
lighter
sentences
than
does
america
but
except
in
isolated
cases
she
treats
them
no
better
she
does
not
recognize
them
as
political
prisoners
if
they
are
distinguished
prisoners
like
jamison
who
was
permitted
to
serve
the
sentence
imposed
upon
him
for
leading
an
armed
raid
into
the
transvaal
in
in

luxuriously
furnished
suite
to
provide

chose

dispensation
is
allowed

imprisoned

alleged
treasonable
article

not
proclaimed

days
in
lieu
of

of

for
the

year

the
first

details
of
their
handsome
treatment
see

pp
writing
a
pamphlet
intended
to
arouse
public
indignation
against
the
treatment
of
a
certain
conscientious
objector
received
special
privileges
in
england
the
matter
of
treatment
rests
largely
with
the
will
of
the
prime
minister
who
dictates
the
policy
to
the
home
secretary
who
in
turn
directs
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
prisons
the
home
secretary
may
however
of
his
own
accord
issue
an
order
for
special
privileges
if
he
so
desires
or
if
there
is
a
strong
demand
for
such
an
order
many
government
commissions
and
many
distinguished
british
statesmen
have
recommended
complete
recognition
and
guarantee
of
the
status
of
political
prisoners
but
the
matter
has
been
left
to
common
law
custom
and
precedent
and
the
character
of
the
prime
minister
in
the
case
of
ireland
the
policy
agreed
upon
is
carried
out
by
the
lord
lieutenant
of
ireland
it
is
difficult
to
generalize
about
england
treatment
of
irish
political
offenders
from
the
earliest
nationalist
activities
she
has
treated
them
practically
all
as
common
criminals
or
worse
if
such
a
thing
is
possible
she
has
either
filled
english
prisons
or
as
in
the
sixties
put
them
in
convict
ships
and
sent
them
to
bermuda
and
australia
for
life
sentences
along
with
common
convicts
where
they
performed
the
hardest
irish
prisoners
have
fought
with
signal
and
persistent
courage
for
the
rights
due
political
offenders
lately
after
militant
demonstrations
within
the
prisons
and
after
deaths
resulting
from
concerted
hunger
striking
protests
some
additional
privileges
have
been
extended
but
these
can
be
and
are
withheld
at
will
there
is
no
guarantee
of
them
as
early
as
canadian
nationalists
who
had
taken
part
in
an
insurrection
in
upper
canada
on
behalf
of
and
who
were
sent
to
van
dieman
land
in
convict
ships
entered
a
vigorous
protest
to
lord
russell
the
home
tary
against
not
receiving
the
treatment
due
political
prisoners
england
has
to
her
credit
then
some
flexibility
about
extending
privileges
to
politicals
we
have
none
england
has
to
her
credit
lighter
cases
excepted
no
country
not
excluding
imperial
germany
has
ever
given
such
cruelly
long
sentences
to
political
offenders
as
did
america
during
the
late
war
i
have
incorporated
this
discussion
in
such
a
book
for
two
reasons
first
because
it
seemed
to
me
important
that
you
should
know
what
a
tremendous
contribution
the
suffrage
prisoners
made
toward
this
enlightened
reform
they
were
the
first
in
america
to
make
a
sustained
demand
to
establish
this
precedent
which
others
will
consummate
they
kept
up
the
demand
to
the
end
of
the
prison
episode
reinforcing
it
by
the
hunger
strike
protest
the
other
reason
for
including
this
discussion
here
is
that
it
seems
to
me
imperative
that
america
recognize
without
further
delay
the
status
of
political
offenders
as
early
as
the
international
prison
congress
meeting
in
london
recommended
a
distinction
in
the
treatment
of
common
law
criminals
and
politicals
and
the
resolution
was
agreed
upon
by
the
representatives
of
all
the
powers
of
europe
and
america
with
the
tacit
concurrence
of
british
and
irish
officials
and
still
we
are
behind
turkey
in
adopting
an
enlightened
policy
we
have
neither
regulation
statute
nor
precedent
nor
have
we
the
custom
of
official
flexibility
most
conspicuous
political
prisoner
from
the
point
of
view
of
actual
power
the
united
states
has
ever
held
in
custody
was
jefferson
davis
the
president
of
the
confederate
states
during
the
rebellion
of
the
south
against
the
union
he
was
imprisoned
in
fortress
monroe
and
subjected
to
the
most
cruel
and
humiliating
treatment
conceivable

of
his
imprisonment
