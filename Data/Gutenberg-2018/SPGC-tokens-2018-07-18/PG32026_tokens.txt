duncan
had
to
hunt
down
anything
that
damaged
his
crops

though
he
was
aware
this

the
tracks

up
one
row

down
another
and
in
those
rows
the
plants
had
been
sheared
off
an
inch
or
two
above
the

the
raider
had
been
methodical
it
had
not
wandered
about
haphazardly
but
had
done
an
efficient
job
of
harvesting
the
first
ten
rows
on
the
west
side
of
the
field
then
having
eaten
its
fill
it
had
angled

somewhere
a
sawmill
bird
was
whirring
through
a
log
and
down
in
one
of
the
ravines
a
choir
of
chatterers
was
clicking
through
a
ghastly
morning
song
it
was
going
to
be
a
scorcher
of
a
day
already
the
smell
of
desiccated
dust
was
rising
from
the
ground
and
the
glare
of
the
newly
risen
sun
was
dancing
off
the
bright
leaves
of
the
making
it
appear
as
if
the
bush
were
filled
with
a
million
flashing
mirrors
gavin
duncan
hauled
a
red
bandanna
from
his
pocket
and
mopped
his
face
no
mister
pleaded
zikkara
the
native
foreman
of
the
farm
you
can
not
do
it
mister
you
do
not
hunt
a
cytha
the
hell
i
do
said
duncan
but
he
spoke
in
english
and
not
the
native
tongue
he
stared
out
across
the
bush
a
flat
expanse
of
grass
interspersed
with
thickets
of
and
thorn
and
occasional
groves
of
trees
by
treacherous
ravines
and
spotted
with
infrequent
waterholes
it
would
be
murderous
out
there
he
told
himself
but
it
take
too
long
the
beast
probably
would
lay
up
shortly
after
its
feeding
and
he
overhaul
it
in
an
hour
or
two
but
if
he
failed
to
overhaul
it
then
he
must
keep
on
dangerous
zikkara
pointed
out
no
one
hunts
the
cytha
i
do
duncan
said
speaking
now
in
the
native
language
i
hunt
anything
that
damages
my
crop
a
few
nights
more
of
this
and
there
would
be
nothing
left
jamming
the
bandanna
back
into
his
pocket
he
tilted
his
hat
lower
across
his
eyes
against
the
sun
it
might
be
a
long
chase
mister
it
is
the
season
now
if
you
were
caught
out
there
now
listen
duncan
told
it
sharply
before
i
came
you
feast
one
day
then
starve
for
days
on
end
but
now
you
eat
each
day
and
you
like
the
doctoring
before
when
you
got
sick
you
died
now
you
get
sick
i
doctor
you
and
you
live
you
like
staying
in
one
place
instead
of
wandering
all
around
mister
we
like
all
this
said
zikkara
but
we
do
not
hunt
the
cytha
if
we
do
not
hunt
the
cytha
we
lose
all
this
duncan
pointed
out
if
i
do
make
a
crop
i
licked
i
have
to
go
away
then
what
happens
to
you
we
will
grow
the
corn
ourselves
that
a
laugh
said
duncan
and
you
know
it
is
if
i
did
kick
your
backsides
all
day
long
you
would
do
a
lick
of
work
if
i
leave
you
go
back
to
the
bush
now
let
go
and
get
that
cytha
but
it
is
such
a
little
one
mister
it
is
such
a
young
one
it
is
scarcely
worth
the
trouble
it
would
be
a
shame
to
kill
it
probably
just
slightly
smaller
than
a
horse
thought
duncan
watching
the
native
closely
it
scared
he
told
himself
it
scared
dry
and
spitless
besides
it
must
have
been
most
hungry
surely
mister
even
a
cytha
has
the
right
to
eat
not
from
my
crop
said
duncan
savagely
you
know
why
we
grow
the
do
you
you
know
it
is
great
medicine
the
berries
that
it
grows
cures
those
who
are
sick
inside
their
heads
my
people
need
that
medicine
need
it
very
badly
and
what
is
more
out
there
he
swept
his
arm
toward
the
sky
out
there
they
pay
very
much
for
it
but
mister
i
tell
you
this
said
duncan
gently
you
either
dig
me
up
a
to
do
the
tracking
for
me
or
you
can
all
get
out
the
kit
and
caboodle
of
you
i
can
get
other
tribes
to
work
the
farm
no
mister
zikkara
screamed
in
desperation
you
have
your
choice
duncan
told
it
coldly
he
plodded
back
across
the
field
toward
the
house
not
much
of
a
house
as
yet
not
a
great
deal
better
than
a
native
shack
but
someday
it
would
be
he
told
himself
let
him
sell
a
crop
or
two
and
he
build
a
house
that
would
really
be
a
house
it
would
have
a
bar
and
swimming
pool
and
a
garden
filled
with
flowers
and
at
last
after
years
of
wandering
he
have
a
home
and
broad
acres
and
everyone
not
just
one
lousy
tribe
would
call
him
mister
gavin
duncan
planter
he
said
to
himself
and
liked
the
sound
of
it
planter
on
the
planet
layard
but
not
if
the
cytha
came
back
night
after
night
and
ate
the
plants
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
that
zikkara
was
racing
for
the
native
village
called
their
bluff
duncan
informed
himself
with
satisfaction
he
came
out
of
the
field
and
walked
across
the
yard
heading
for
the
house
one
of
shotwell
shirts
was
hanging
on
the
limp
in
the
breathless
morning
damn
the
man
thought
duncan
out
here
mucking
around
with
those
stupid
natives
always
asking
questions
always
under
foot
although
to
be
fair
about
it
that
was
shotwell
job
that
was
what
the
sociology
people
had
sent
him
out
to
do
duncan
came
up
to
the
shack
pushed
the
door
open
and
entered
shotwell
stripped
to
the
waist
was
at
the
wash
bench
breakfast
was
cooking
on
the
stove
with
an
elderly
native
acting
as
cook
duncan
strode
across
the
room
and
took
down
the
heavy
rifle
from
its
peg
he
slapped
the
action
open
slapped
it
shut
again
shotwell
reached
for
a
towel
what
going
on
he
asked
cytha
got
into
the
field
cytha
a
kind
of
animal
said
duncan
it
ate
ten
rows
of
big
little
what
are
its
characteristics
the
native
began
putting
breakfast
on
the
table
duncan
walked
to
the
table
laid
the
rifle
across
one
corner
of
it
and
sat
down
he
poured
a
brackish
liquid
out
of
a
big
stew
pan
into
their
cups
god
he
thought
what
i
would
give
for
a
cup
of
coffee
shotwell
pulled
up
his
chair
you
did
answer
me
what
is
a
cytha
like
i
would
know
said
duncan
do
know
but
you
going
after
it
looks
like
and
how
can
you
hunt
it
if
you
do
know
track
it
the
thing
tied
to
the
other
end
of
the
trail
is
sure
to
be
the
cytha
well
find
out
what
it
like
once
we
catch
up
to
it
we
the
natives
will
send
up
someone
to
do
the
tracking
for
me
some
of
them
are
better
than
a
dog
look
gavin
i
put
you
to
a
lot
of
trouble
and
you
been
decent
with
me
if
i
can
be
any
help
i
would
like
to
go
two
make
better
time
than
three
and
we
have
to
catch
this
cytha
fast
or
it
might
settle
down
to
an
endurance
contest
all
right
then
tell
me
about
the
cytha
duncan
poured
porridge
gruel
into
his
bowl
handed
the
pan
to
shotwell
it
a
sort
of
special
thing
the
natives
are
scared
to
death
of
it
you
hear
a
lot
of
stories
about
it
said
to
be
unkillable
it
always
capitalized
always
a
proper
noun
it
has
been
reported
at
different
times
from
widely
scattered
places
no
one
ever
bagged
one
not
that
i
ever
heard
of
duncan
patted
the
rifle
let
me
get
a
bead
on
it
he
started
eating
spooning
the
porridge
into
his
mouth
munching
on
the
stale
corn
bread
left
from
the
night
before
he
drank
some
of
the
brackish
beverage
and
shuddered
some
day
he
said
i
going
to
scrape
together
enough
money
to
buy
a
pound
of
coffee
you
think
it
the
freight
rates
shotwell
said
i
send
you
a
pound
when
i
go
back
not
at
the
price
they
charge
to
ship
it
out
said
duncan
i
would
hear
of
it
they
ate
in
silence
for
a
time
finally
shotwell
said
i
getting
nowhere
gavin
the
natives
are
willing
to
talk
but
it
all
adds
up
to
nothing
i
tried
to
tell
you
that
you
could
have
saved
your
time
shotwell
shook
his
head
stubbornly
there
an
answer
a
logical
explanation
it
easy
enough
to
say
you
can
not
rule
out
the
sexual
factor
but
that
exactly
what
has
happened
here
on
layard
it
easy
to
exclaim
that
a
sexless
animal
a
sexless
race
a
sexless
planet
is
impossible
but
that
is
what
we
have
somewhere
there
is
an
answer
and
i
have
to
find
it
now
hold
up
a
minute
duncan
protested
there
no
use
blowing
a
gasket
i
have
got
the
time
this
morning
to
listen
to
your
lecture
but
it
not
the
lack
of
sex
that
worries
me
entirely
shotwell
said
although
it
the
central
factor
there
are
subsidiary
situations
deriving
from
that
central
fact
which
are
most
intriguing
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
duncan
but
if
you
please
without
sex
there
is
no
basis
for
the
family
and
without
the
family
there
is
no
basis
for
a
tribe
and
yet
the
natives
have
an
elaborate
tribal
setup
with
taboos
by
way
of
regulation
somewhere
there
must
exist
some
underlying
basic
unifying
factor
some
common
loyalty
some
strange
relationship
which
spells
out
to
brotherhood
not
brotherhood
said
duncan
chuckling
not
even
sisterhood
you
must
watch
your
terminology
the
word
you
want
is
ithood
the
door
pushed
open
and
a
native
walked
in
timidly
zikkara
said
that
mister
want
me
the
native
told
them
i
am
sipar
i
can
track
anything
but
screamers
longhorns
and
donovans
those
are
my
taboos
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
duncan
replied
you
have
no
cytha
taboo
then
cytha
yipped
the
native
zikkara
did
not
tell
me
cytha
duncan
paid
no
attention
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
went
to
the
heavy
chest
that
stood
against
one
wall
he
rummaged
in
it
and
came
out
with
a
pair
of
binoculars
a
hunting
knife
and
an
extra
drum
of
ammunition
at
the
kitchen
cupboard
he
rummaged
once
again
filling
a
small
leather
sack
with
a
gritty
powder
from
a
can
he
found
rockahominy
he
explained
to
shotwell
emergency
rations
thought
up
by
the
primitive
north
american
indians
parched
corn
ground
fine
it
no
feast
exactly
but
it
keeps
a
man
going
you
figure
you
be
gone
that
long
maybe
overnight
i
do
know
wo
stop
until
i
get
it
afford
to
it
could
wipe
me
out
in
a
few
days
good
hunting
shotwell
said
i
hold
the
fort
duncan
said
to
sipar
quit
sniveling
and
come
on
he
picked
up
the
rifle
settled
it
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
he
kicked
open
the
door
and
strode
out
sipar
followed
meekly
ii
duncan
got
his
first
shot
late
in
the
afternoon
of
that
first
day
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
two
hours
after
they
had
left
the
farm
they
had
flushed
the
cytha
out
of
its
bed
in
a
thick
ravine
but
there
had
been
no
chance
for
a
shot
duncan
saw
no
more
than
a
huge
black
blur
fade
into
the
bush
through
the
afternoon
they
had
followed
its
trail
sipar
tracking
and
duncan
bringing
up
the
rear
scanning
every
piece
of
cover
with
the
rifle
always
held
at
ready
once
they
had
been
held
up
for
fifteen
minutes
while
a
massive
donovan
tramped
back
and
forth
screaming
trying
to
work
up
its
courage
for
attack
but
after
a
quarter
hour
of
showing
off
it
decided
to
behave
itself
and
went
off
at
a
shuffling
gallop
duncan
watched
it
go
with
a
lot
of
thankfulness
it
could
soak
up
a
lot
of
lead
and
for
all
its
awkwardness
it
was
handy
with
its
feet
once
it
set
itself
in
motion
donovans
had
killed
a
lot
of
men
in
the
twenty
years
since
earthmen
had
come
to
layard
with
the
beast
gone
duncan
looked
around
for
sipar
he
found
it
fast
asleep
beneath
a
he
kicked
the
native
awake
with
something
less
than
gentleness
and
they
went
on
again
the
bush
swarmed
with
other
animals
but
they
had
no
trouble
with
them
sipar
despite
its
initial
reluctance
had
worked
well
at
the
trailing
a
misplaced
bunch
of
grass
a
twig
bent
to
one
side
a
displaced
stone
the
faintest
pug
mark
were
sipar
stock
in
trade
it
worked
like
a
lithe
hound
this
bush
country
was
its
special
province
here
it
was
at
home
with
the
sun
dropping
toward
the
west
they
had
climbed
a
long
steep
hill
and
as
they
neared
the
top
of
it
duncan
hissed
at
sipar
the
native
looked
back
over
its
shoulder
in
surprise
duncan
made
motions
for
it
to
stop
tracking
the
native
crouched
and
as
duncan
went
past
it
he
saw
that
a
look
of
agony
was
twisting
its
face
and
in
the
look
of
agony
he
thought
he
saw
as
well
a
touch
of
pleading
and
a
trace
of
hatred
it
scared
just
like
the
rest
of
them
duncan
told
himself
but
what
the
native
thought
or
felt
had
no
significance
what
counted
was
the
beast
ahead
duncan
went
the
last
few
yards
on
his
belly
pushing
the
gun
ahead
of
him
the
binoculars
bumping
on
his
back
swift
vicious
insects
ran
out
of
the
grass
and
swarmed
across
his
hands
and
arms
and
one
got
on
his
face
and
bit
him
he
made
it
to
the
hilltop
and
lay
there
looking
at
the
sweep
of
land
beyond
it
was
more
of
the
same
more
of
the
blistering
dusty
slogging
more
of
thorn
and
tangled
ravine
and
awful
emptiness
he
lay
motionless
watching
for
a
hint
of
motion
for
the
fitful
shadow
for
any
wrongness
in
the
terrain
that
might
be
the
cytha
but
there
was
nothing
the
land
lay
quiet
under
the
declining
sun
far
on
the
horizon
a
herd
of
some
sort
of
animals
was
grazing
but
there
was
nothing
else
then
he
saw
the
motion
just
a
flicker
on
the
knoll
ahead
about
halfway
up
he
laid
the
rifle
carefully
on
the
ground
and
hitched
the
binoculars
around
he
raised
them
to
his
eyes
and
moved
them
slowly
back
and
forth
the
animal
was
there
where
he
had
seen
the
motion
it
was
resting
looking
back
along
the
way
that
it
had
come
watching
for
the
first
sign
of
its
trailers
duncan
tried
to
make
out
the
size
and
shape
but
it
blended
with
the
grass
and
the
dun
soil
and
he
could
not
be
sure
exactly
what
it
looked
like
he
let
the
glasses
down
and
now
that
he
had
located
it
he
could
distinguish
its
outline
with
the
naked
eye
his
hand
reached
out
and
slid
the
rifle
to
him
he
fitted
it
to
his
shoulder
and
wriggled
his
body
for
closer
contact
with
the
ground
the
centered
on
the
faint
outline
on
the
knoll
and
then
the
beast
stood
up
it
was
not
as
large
as
he
had
thought
it
might
be
perhaps
a
little
larger
than
earth
but
it
certainly
was
no
lion
it
was
a
thing
and
black
and
inclined
to
lumpiness
and
it
had
an
awkward
look
about
it
but
there
were
strength
and
ferociousness
as
well
duncan
tilted
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
so
that
the
centered
on
the
massive
neck
he
drew
in
a
breath
and
held
it
and
began
the
trigger
squeeze
the
rifle
bucked
hard
against
his
shoulder
and
the
report
hammered
in
his
head
and
the
beast
went
down
it
did
not
lurch
or
fall
it
simply
melted
down
and
disappeared
hidden
in
the
grass
dead
center
duncan
assured
himself
he
worked
the
mechanism
and
the
spent
cartridge
case
flew
out
the
feeding
mechanism
snicked
and
the
fresh
shell
clicked
as
it
slid
into
the
breech
he
lay
for
a
moment
watching
and
on
the
knoll
where
the
thing
had
fallen
the
grass
was
twitching
as
if
the
wind
were
blowing
only
there
was
no
wind
but
despite
the
twitching
of
the
grass
there
was
no
sign
of
the
cytha
it
did
not
struggle
up
again
it
stayed
where
it
had
fallen
duncan
got
to
his
feet
dug
out
the
bandanna
and
mopped
at
his
face
he
heard
the
soft
thud
of
the
step
behind
him
and
turned
his
head
it
was
the
tracker
it
all
right
sipar
he
said
you
can
quit
worrying
i
got
it
we
can
go
home
now
it
had
been
a
long
hard
chase
longer
than
he
had
thought
it
might
be
but
it
had
been
successful
and
that
was
the
thing
that
counted
for
the
moment
the
crop
was
safe
he
tucked
the
bandanna
back
into
his
pocket
went
down
the
slope
and
started
up
the
knoll
he
reached
the
place
where
the
cytha
had
fallen
there
were
three
small
gouts
of
torn
mangled
fur
and
flesh
lying
on
the
ground
and
there
was
nothing
else
he
spun
around
and
jerked
his
rifle
up
every
nerve
was
screamingly
alert
he
swung
his
head
searching
for
the
slightest
movement
for
some
shape
or
color
that
was
not
the
shape
or
color
of
the
bush
or
grass
or
ground
but
there
was
nothing
the
heat
droned
in
the
hush
of
afternoon
there
was
not
a
breath
of
moving
air
but
there
was
danger
a
sense
of
danger
close
behind
his
neck
sipar
he
called
in
a
tense
whisper
watch
out
the
native
stood
motionless
unheeding
its
eyeballs
rolling
up
until
there
was
only
white
while
the
muscles
stood
out
along
its
throat
like
straining
ropes
of
steel
duncan
slowly
swiveled
rifle
held
almost
at
arm
length
elbows
crooked
a
little
ready
to
bring
the
weapon
into
play
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
nothing
stirred
there
was
no
more
than
emptiness
the
emptiness
of
sun
and
molten
sky
of
grass
and
scraggy
bush
of
a
land
stretching
into
foreverness
step
by
step
duncan
covered
the
hillside
and
finally
came
back
to
the
place
where
the
native
squatted
on
its
heels
and
moaned
rocking
back
and
forth
arms
locked
tightly
across
its
chest
as
if
it
tried
to
cradle
itself
in
a
sort
of
illusory
comfort
the
earthman
walked
to
the
place
where
the
cytha
had
fallen
and
picked
up
one
by
one
the
bits
of
bleeding
flesh
they
had
been
mangled
by
his
bullet
they
were
limp
and
had
no
shape
and
it
was
queer
he
thought
in
all
his
years
of
hunting
over
many
planets
he
had
never
known
a
bullet
to
rip
out
hunks
of
flesh
he
dropped
the
bloody
pieces
back
into
the
grass
and
wiped
his
hand
upon
his
thighs
he
got
up
a
little
stiffly
he
found
no
trail
of
blood
leading
through
the
grass
and
surely
an
animal
with
a
hole
of
that
size
would
leave
a
trail
and
as
he
stood
there
upon
the
hillside
with
the
bloody
fingerprints
still
wet
and
glistening
upon
the
fabric
of
his
trousers
he
felt
the
first
cold
touch
of
fear
as
if
the
fingertips
of
fear
might
momentarily
almost
casually
have
trailed
across
his
heart
he
turned
around
and
walked
back
to
the
native
reached
down
and
shook
it
snap
out
of
it
he
ordered
he
expected
pleading
cowering
terror
but
there
was
none
sipar
got
swiftly
to
its
feet
and
stood
looking
at
him
and
there
was
he
thought
an
odd
glitter
in
its
eyes
get
going
duncan
said
we
still
have
a
little
time
start
circling
and
pick
up
the
trail
i
will
cover
you
he
glanced
at
the
sun
an
hour
and
a
half
still
left
maybe
as
much
as
two
there
might
still
be
time
to
get
this
buttoned
up
before
the
fall
of
night
a
half
mile
beyond
the
knoll
sipar
picked
up
the
trail
again
and
they
went
ahead
but
now
they
traveled
more
cautiously
for
any
bush
any
rock
any
clump
of
grass
might
conceal
the
wounded
beast
duncan
found
himself
on
edge
and
cursed
himself
savagely
for
it
been
in
tight
spots
before
this
was
nothing
new
to
him
there
was
no
reason
to
get
himself
tensed
up
it
was
a
deadly
business
sure
but
he
had
faced
others
calmly
and
walked
away
from
them
it
was
those
frontier
tales
he
heard
about
the
cytha
the
kind
of
superstitious
chatter
that
one
always
heard
on
the
edge
of
unknown
land
he
gripped
the
rifle
tighter
and
went
on
no
animal
he
told
himself
was
unkillable
half
an
hour
before
sunset
he
called
a
halt
when
they
reached
a
brackish
waterhole
the
light
soon
would
be
getting
bad
for
shooting
in
the
morning
they
take
up
the
trail
again
and
by
that
time
the
cytha
would
be
at
an
even
greater
disadvantage
it
would
be
stiff
and
slow
and
weak
it
might
be
even
dead
duncan
gathered
wood
and
built
a
fire
in
the
lee
of
a
thicket
sipar
waded
out
with
the
canteens
and
thrust
them
at
length
beneath
the
surface
to
fill
them
the
water
still
was
warm
and
but
it
was
fairly
free
of
scum
and
a
thirsty
man
could
drink
it
the
sun
went
down
and
darkness
fell
quickly
they
dragged
more
wood
out
of
the
thicket
and
piled
it
carefully
close
at
hand
duncan
reached
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
the
little
bag
of
rockahominy
here
he
said
to
sipar
supper
the
native
held
one
hand
cupped
and
duncan
poured
a
little
mound
into
its
palm
thank
you
mister
sipar
said
huh
asked
duncan
then
caught
what
the
native
meant
dive
into
it
he
said
almost
kindly
it
is
much
but
it
gives
you
strength
we
need
strength
tomorrow
eh
trying
to
butter
him
up
perhaps
in
a
little
while
sipar
would
start
whining
for
him
to
knock
off
the
hunt
and
head
back
for
the
farm
although
come
to
think
of
it
he
really
was
the
to
this
bunch
of
sexless
wonders
corn
thank
god
grew
well
on
the
red
and
stubborn
soil
of
layard
good
old
corn
from
north
america
fed
to
hogs
made
into
for
breakfast
back
on
earth
and
here
on
layard
the
staple
food
crop
for
a
gang
of
shiftless
varmints
who
still
regarded
with
some
good
solid
skepticism
and
wonder
this
unorthodox
idea
that
one
should
take
the
trouble
to
grow
plants
to
eat
rather
than
go
out
and
scrounge
for
them
corn
from
north
america
he
thought
growing
side
by
side
with
the
of
layard
and
that
was
the
way
it
went
something
from
one
planet
and
something
from
another
and
still
something
further
from
a
third
and
so
was
built
up
through
the
wide
social
confederacy
of
space
a
truly
cosmic
culture
which
in
the
end
in
another
ten
thousand
years
or
so
might
spell
out
some
way
of
life
with
more
sanity
and
understanding
than
was
evident
today
he
poured
a
mound
of
rockahominy
into
his
own
hand
and
put
the
bag
back
into
his
pocket
sipar
yes
mister
you
were
not
scared
today
when
the
donovan
threatened
to
attack
us
no
mister
the
donovan
would
not
hurt
me
i
see
you
said
the
donovan
was
taboo
to
you
could
it
be
that
you
likewise
are
taboo
to
the
donovan
yes
mister
the
donovan
and
i
grew
up
together
oh
so
that
it
said
duncan
he
put
a
pinch
of
the
parched
and
powdered
corn
into
his
mouth
and
took
a
sip
of
brackish
water
he
chewed
reflectively
on
the
resultant
mash
he
might
go
ahead
he
knew
and
ask
why
and
how
and
where
sipar
and
the
donovan
had
grown
up
together
but
there
was
no
point
to
it
this
was
exactly
the
kind
of
tangle
that
shotwell
was
forever
getting
into
half
the
time
he
told
himself
i
convinced
the
little
stinkers
are
doing
no
more
than
pulling
our
legs
what
a
fantastic
bunch
of
jerks
not
men
not
women
just
things
and
while
there
were
never
babies
there
were
children
although
never
less
than
eight
or
nine
years
old
and
if
there
were
no
babies
where
did
the
come
from
i
suppose
he
said
that
these
other
things
that
are
your
taboos
the
and
the
screamers
and
the
like
also
grew
up
with
you
that
is
right
mister
some
playground
that
must
have
been
said
duncan
he
went
on
chewing
staring
out
into
the
darkness
beyond
the
ring
of
firelight
there
something
in
the
thorn
bush
mister
i
did
hear
a
thing
little
pattering
something
is
running
there
duncan
listened
closely
what
sipar
said
was
true
a
lot
of
little
things
were
running
in
the
thicket
more
than
likely
mice
he
said
he
finished
his
rockahominy
and
took
an
extra
swig
of
water
gagging
on
it
slightly
get
your
rest
he
told
sipar
i
wake
you
later
so
i
can
catch
a
wink
or
two
mister
sipar
said
i
will
stay
with
you
to
the
end
well
said
duncan
somewhat
startled
that
is
decent
of
you
i
will
stay
to
the
death
sipar
promised
earnestly
do
strain
yourself
said
duncan
he
picked
up
the
rifle
and
walked
down
to
the
waterhole
the
night
was
quiet
and
the
land
continued
to
have
that
empty
feeling
empty
except
for
the
fire
and
the
waterhole
and
the
little
micelike
animals
running
in
the
thicket
and
sipar
sipar
lying
by
the
fire
curled
up
and
sound
asleep
already
naked
with
not
a
weapon
to
its
hand
just
the
naked
animal
the
basic
humanoid
and
yet
with
underlying
purpose
that
at
times
was
baffling
scared
and
shivering
this
morning
at
mere
mention
of
the
cytha
yet
never
faltering
on
the
trail
in
pure
funk
back
there
on
the
knoll
where
they
had
lost
the
cytha
but
now
ready
to
go
on
to
the
death
duncan
went
back
to
the
fire
and
prodded
sipar
with
his
toe
the
native
came
straight
up
out
of
sleep
whose
death
asked
duncan
whose
death
were
you
talking
of
why
ours
of
course
said
sipar
and
went
back
to
sleep
iii
duncan
did
not
see
the
arrow
coming
he
heard
the
swishing
whistle
and
felt
the
wind
of
it
on
the
right
side
of
his
throat
and
then
it
thunked
into
a
tree
behind
him
he
leaped
aside
and
dived
for
the
cover
of
a
tumbled
mound
of
boulders
and
almost
instinctively
his
thumb
pushed
the
fire
control
of
the
rifle
up
to
automatic
he
crouched
behind
the
jumbled
rocks
and
peered
ahead
there
was
not
a
thing
to
see
the
shimmered
in
the
blaze
of
sun
and
the
was
gray
and
lifeless
and
the
only
things
astir
were
three
walking
gravely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
sipar
he
whispered
here
mister
keep
low
it
still
out
there
whatever
it
might
be
still
out
there
and
waiting
for
another
shot
duncan
shivered
remembering
the
feel
of
the
arrow
flying
past
his
throat
a
hell
of
a
way
for
a
man
to
die
out
at
the
of
nowhere
with
an
arrow
in
his
throat
and
a
native
heading
back
for
home
as
fast
as
it
could
go
he
flicked
the
control
on
the
rifle
back
to
single
fire
crawled
around
the
rock
pile
and
sprinted
for
a
grove
of
trees
that
stood
on
higher
ground
he
reached
them
and
there
he
flanked
the
spot
from
which
the
arrow
must
have
come
he
unlimbered
the
binoculars
and
glassed
the
area
he
still
saw
no
sign
whatever
had
taken
the
pot
shot
at
them
had
made
its
getaway
he
walked
back
to
the
tree
where
the
arrow
still
stood
out
its
point
driven
deep
into
the
bark
he
grasped
the
shaft
and
wrenched
the
arrow
free
you
can
come
out
now
he
called
to
sipar
there
no
one
around
the
arrow
was
unbelievably
crude
the
unfeathered
shaft
looked
as
if
it
had
been
battered
off
to
the
proper
length
with
a
jagged
stone
the
arrowhead
was
unflaked
flint
picked
up
from
some
outcropping
or
dry
creek
bed
and
it
was
awkwardly
bound
to
the
shaft
with
the
tough
but
pliant
inner
bark
of
the
you
recognize
this
he
asked
sipar
the
native
took
the
arrow
and
examined
it
not
my
tribe
of
course
not
your
tribe
yours
would
take
a
shot
at
us
some
other
tribe
perhaps
very
poor
arrow
i
know
that
but
it
could
kill
you
just
as
dead
as
if
it
were
a
good
one
do
you
recognize
it
no
tribe
made
this
arrow
sipar
declared
child
maybe
what
would
child
do
way
out
here
illustration
that
what
i
thought
too
said
duncan
he
took
the
arrow
back
held
it
between
his
thumbs
and
forefingers
and
twirled
it
slowly
with
a
terrifying
thought
nibbling
at
his
brain
it
could
be
it
was
too
fantastic
he
wondered
if
the
sun
was
finally
getting
him
that
he
had
thought
of
it
at
all
he
squatted
down
and
dug
at
the
ground
with
the
makeshift
arrow
point
sipar
what
do
you
actually
know
about
the
cytha
nothing
mister
scared
of
it
is
all
we
are
turning
back
if
there
something
that
you
know
something
that
would
help
us
it
was
as
close
as
he
could
come
to
begging
aid
it
was
further
than
he
had
meant
to
go
he
should
not
have
asked
at
all
he
thought
angrily
i
do
not
know
the
native
said
duncan
cast
the
arrow
to
one
side
and
rose
to
his
feet
he
cradled
the
rifle
in
his
arm
let
go
he
watched
sipar
trot
ahead
crafty
little
stinker
he
told
himself
it
knows
more
than
it
telling
they
toiled
into
the
afternoon
it
was
if
possible
hotter
and
drier
than
the
day
before
there
was
a
sense
of
tension
in
the
air
no
that
was
rot
and
even
if
there
were
a
man
must
act
as
if
it
were
not
there
if
he
let
himself
fall
prey
to
every
mood
out
in
this
empty
land
he
only
had
himself
to
blame
for
whatever
happened
to
him
the
tracking
was
harder
now
the
day
before
the
cytha
had
only
run
away
fleeing
to
keep
ahead
of
them
to
stay
out
of
their
reach
now
it
was
becoming
tricky
it
backtracked
often
in
an
attempt
to
throw
them
off
twice
in
the
afternoon
the
trail
blanked
out
entirely
and
it
was
only
after
long
searching
that
sipar
picked
it
up
again
in
one
instance
a
mile
away
from
where
it
had
vanished
in
thin
air
that
vanishing
bothered
duncan
more
than
he
would
admit
trails
do
not
disappear
entirely
not
when
the
terrain
remains
the
same
not
when
the
weather
is
unchanged
something
was
going
on
something
perhaps
that
sipar
knew
far
more
about
than
it
was
willing
to
divulge
he
watched
the
native
closely
and
there
seemed
nothing
suspicious
it
continued
at
its
work
it
was
for
all
to
see
the
good
and
faithful
hound
late
in
the
afternoon
the
plain
on
which
they
had
been
traveling
suddenly
dropped
away
they
stood
poised
on
the
brink
of
a
great
escarpment
and
looked
far
out
to
great
tangled
forests
and
a
flowing
river
it
was
like
suddenly
coming
into
another
and
beautiful
room
that
one
had
not
expected
this
was
new
land
never
seen
before
by
any
earthman
for
no
one
had
ever
mentioned
that
somewhere
to
the
west
a
forest
lay
beyond
the
bush
men
coming
in
from
space
had
seen
it
probably
but
only
as
a
different
on
the
planet
to
them
it
made
no
difference
but
to
the
men
who
lived
on
layard
to
the
planter
and
the
trader
the
prospector
and
the
hunter
it
was
important
and
i
thought
duncan
with
a
sense
of
triumph
am
the
man
who
found
it
mister
now
what
out
there
i
do
out
there
mister
across
the
river
duncan
saw
it
then
a
haze
in
the
blueness
of
the
rift
a
puff
of
copper
moving
very
fast
and
as
he
watched
he
heard
the
keening
of
the
storm
a
shiver
in
the
air
rather
than
a
sound
he
watched
in
fascination
as
it
moved
along
the
river
and
saw
the
boiling
fury
it
made
out
of
the
forest
it
struck
and
crossed
the
river
and
the
river
for
a
moment
seemed
to
stand
on
end
with
a
sheet
of
silvery
water
splashed
toward
the
sky
then
it
was
gone
as
quickly
as
it
had
happened
but
there
was
a
tumbled
slash
across
the
forest
where
the
churning
winds
had
traveled
back
at
the
farm
zikkara
had
warned
him
of
the
this
was
the
season
for
them
it
had
said
and
a
man
caught
in
one
would
have
a
chance
duncan
let
his
breath
out
slowly
bad
said
sipar
yes
very
bad
hit
fast
no
warning
what
about
the
trail
asked
duncan
did
the
cytha
sipar
nodded
downward
can
we
make
it
before
nightfall
i
think
so
sipar
answered
it
was
rougher
than
they
had
thought
twice
they
went
down
blind
trails
that
pinched
off
with
sheer
rock
faces
opening
out
into
drops
of
hundreds
of
feet
and
were
forced
to
climb
again
and
find
another
way
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
escarpment
as
the
brief
twilight
closed
in
and
they
hurried
to
gather
firewood
there
was
no
water
but
a
little
was
still
left
in
their
canteens
and
they
made
do
with
that
after
their
scant
meal
of
rockahominy
sipar
rolled
himself
into
a
ball
and
went
to
sleep
immediately
duncan
sat
with
his
back
against
a
boulder
which
one
day
long
ago
had
fallen
from
the
slope
above
them
but
was
now
half
buried
in
the
soil
that
through
the
ages
had
kept
sifting
down
two
days
gone
he
told
himself
was
there
after
all
some
truth
in
the
whispered
tales
that
made
the
rounds
back
at
the
settlements
that
no
one
should
waste
his
time
in
tracking
down
a
cytha
since
a
cytha
was
unkillable
nonsense
he
told
himself
and
yet
the
hunt
had
toughened
the
trail
become
more
difficult
the
cytha
a
much
more
cunning
and
elusive
quarry
where
it
had
run
from
them
the
day
before
now
it
fought
to
shake
them
off
and
if
it
did
that
the
second
day
why
had
it
not
tried
to
throw
them
off
the
first
and
what
about
the
third
day
tomorrow
he
shook
his
head
it
seemed
incredible
that
an
animal
would
become
more
formidable
as
the
hunt
progressed
but
that
seemed
to
be
exactly
what
had
happened
more
spooked
perhaps
more
frightened
only
the
cytha
did
not
act
like
a
frightened
beast
it
was
acting
like
an
animal
that
was
gaining
savvy
and
determination
and
that
was
somehow
frightening
from
far
off
to
the
west
toward
the
forest
and
the
river
came
the
laughter
and
the
howling
of
a
pack
of
screamers
duncan
leaned
his
rifle
against
the
boulder
and
got
up
to
pile
more
wood
on
the
fire
he
stared
out
into
the
western
darkness
listening
to
the
racket
he
made
a
wry
face
and
pushed
a
hand
through
his
hair
he
put
out
a
silent
hope
that
the
screamers
would
decide
to
keep
their
distance
they
were
something
a
man
could
do
without
behind
him
a
pebble
came
bumping
down
the
slope
it
thudded
to
a
rest
just
short
of
the
fire
duncan
spun
around
foolish
thing
to
do
he
thought
to
camp
so
near
the
slope
if
something
big
should
start
to
move
they
be
out
of
luck
he
stood
and
listened
the
night
was
quiet
even
the
screamers
had
shut
up
for
the
moment
just
one
rolling
rock
and
he
had
his
hackles
up
he
have
to
get
himself
in
hand
he
went
back
to
the
boulder
and
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
rifle
he
heard
the
faint
beginning
of
a
rumble
he
straightened
swiftly
to
face
the
scarp
that
blotted
out
the
sky
and
the
rumble
grew
in
one
leap
he
was
at
sipar
side
he
reached
down
and
grasped
the
native
by
an
arm
jerked
it
erect
held
it
on
its
feet
sipar
eyes
snapped
open
blinking
in
the
firelight
the
rumble
had
grown
to
a
roar
and
there
were
thumping
noises
as
of
heavy
boulders
bouncing
and
beneath
the
roar
the
silky
ominous
rustle
of
sliding
soil
and
rock
sipar
jerked
its
arm
free
of
duncan
grip
and
plunged
into
the
darkness
duncan
whirled
and
followed
they
ran
stumbling
in
the
dark
and
behind
them
the
roar
of
the
sliding
bouncing
rock
became
a
throaty
roll
of
thunder
that
filled
the
night
from
brim
to
brim
as
he
ran
duncan
could
feel
in
dread
anticipation
the
gusty
breath
of
hurtling
debris
blowing
on
his
neck
the
crushing
impact
of
a
boulder
smashing
into
him
the
engulfing
flood
of
tumbling
talus
snatching
at
his
legs
a
puff
of
billowing
dust
came
out
and
caught
them
and
they
ran
choking
as
well
as
stumbling
off
to
the
left
of
them
a
mighty
chunk
of
rock
chugged
along
the
ground
in
jerky
almost
reluctant
fashion
then
the
thunder
stopped
and
all
one
could
hear
was
the
small
slitherings
of
the
lesser
debris
as
it
trickled
down
the
slope
duncan
stopped
running
and
slowly
turned
around
the
campfire
was
gone
buried
no
doubt
beneath
tons
of
overlay
and
the
stars
had
paled
because
of
the
great
cloud
of
dust
which
still
billowed
up
into
the
sky
he
heard
sipar
moving
near
him
and
reached
out
a
hand
searching
for
the
tracker
not
knowing
exactly
where
it
was
he
found
the
native
grasped
it
by
the
shoulder
and
pulled
it
up
beside
him
sipar
was
shivering
it
all
right
said
duncan
and
it
all
right
he
reassured
himself
he
still
had
the
rifle
the
extra
drum
of
ammunition
and
the
knife
were
on
his
belt
the
bag
of
rockahominy
in
his
pocket
the
canteens
were
all
they
had
lost
the
canteens
and
the
fire
we
have
to
hole
up
somewhere
for
the
night
duncan
said
there
are
screamers
on
the
loose
he
did
like
what
he
was
thinking
nor
the
sharp
edge
of
fear
that
was
beginning
to
crowd
in
upon
him
he
tried
to
shrug
it
off
but
it
still
stayed
with
him
just
out
of
reach
sipar
plucked
at
his
elbow
thorn
thicket
mister
over
there
we
could
crawl
inside
we
would
be
safe
from
screamers
it
was
torture
but
they
made
it
screamers
and
you
are
taboo
said
duncan
suddenly
remembering
how
come
you
are
afraid
of
them
afraid
for
you
mister
mostly
afraid
for
myself
just
a
little
screamers
could
forget
they
might
not
recognize
me
until
too
late
safer
here
i
agree
with
you
said
duncan
the
screamers
came
and
padded
all
about
the
thicket
the
beasts
sniffed
and
clawed
at
the
thorns
to
reach
them
but
finally
went
away
when
morning
came
duncan
and
sipar
climbed
the
scarp
clambering
over
the
boulders
and
the
tons
of
soil
and
rock
that
covered
their
camping
place
following
the
gash
cut
by
the
slide
they
clambered
up
the
slope
and
finally
reached
the
point
of
the
slide
beginning
there
they
found
the
depression
in
which
the
poised
slab
of
rock
had
rested
and
where
the
supporting
soil
had
been
dug
away
so
that
it
could
be
started
with
a
push
down
the
slope
above
the
campfire
and
all
about
were
the
deeply
sunken
pug
marks
of
the
cytha
iv
now
it
was
more
than
just
a
hunt
it
was
knife
against
the
throat
kill
or
be
killed
now
there
was
no
stopping
when
before
there
might
have
been
it
was
no
longer
sport
and
there
was
no
mercy
and
that
the
way
i
like
it
duncan
told
himself
he
rubbed
his
hand
along
the
rifle
barrel
and
saw
the
metallic
glints
shine
in
the
noonday
sun
one
more
shot
he
prayed
just
give
me
one
more
shot
at
it
this
time
there
will
be
no
this
time
there
will
be
more
than
three
sodden
hunks
of
flesh
and
fur
lying
in
the
grass
to
mock
me
he
squinted
his
eyes
against
the
heat
shimmer
rising
from
the
river
watching
sipar
hunkered
beside
the
water
edge
the
native
rose
to
its
feet
and
trotted
back
to
him
it
crossed
said
sipar
it
walked
out
as
far
as
it
could
go
and
it
must
have
swum
are
you
sure
it
might
have
waded
out
to
make
us
think
it
crossed
then
doubled
back
again
he
stared
at
the
of
the
trees
across
the
river
inside
that
forest
it
would
be
hellish
going
we
can
look
said
sipar
good
you
go
downstream
i
go
up
an
hour
later
they
were
back
they
had
found
no
tracks
there
seemed
little
doubt
the
cytha
had
really
crossed
the
river
they
stood
side
by
side
looking
at
the
forest
mister
we
have
come
far
you
are
brave
to
hunt
the
cytha
you
have
no
fear
of
death
the
fear
of
death
duncan
said
is
entirely
infantile
and
beside
the
point
as
well
i
do
not
intend
to
die
they
waded
out
into
the
stream
the
bottom
shelved
gradually
and
they
had
to
swim
no
more
than
a
hundred
yards
or
so
they
reached
the
forest
bank
and
threw
themselves
flat
to
rest
duncan
looked
back
the
way
that
they
had
come
to
the
east
the
escarpment
was
a
smudge
against
the
burnished
sky
and
two
days
back
of
that
lay
the
farm
and
the
field
but
they
seemed
much
farther
off
than
that
they
were
lost
in
time
and
distance
they
belonged
to
another
existence
and
another
world
all
his
life
it
seemed
to
him
had
faded
and
become
inconsequential
and
forgotten
as
if
this
moment
in
his
life
were
the
only
one
that
counted
as
if
all
the
minutes
and
the
hours
all
the
breaths
and
heartbeats
wake
and
sleep
had
pointed
toward
this
certain
hour
upon
this
certain
stream
with
the
rifle
molded
to
his
hand
and
the
cool
calculated
bloodlust
of
a
killer
riding
in
his
brain
sipar
finally
got
up
and
began
to
range
along
the
stream
duncan
sat
up
and
watched
scared
to
death
he
thought
and
yet
it
stayed
with
me
at
the
campfire
that
first
night
it
had
said
it
would
stick
to
the
death
and
apparently
it
had
meant
exactly
what
it
said
it
hard
he
thought
to
figure
out
these
jokers
hard
to
know
what
kind
of
mental
operation
what
seethings
of
emotion
what
brand
of
ethics
and
what
variety
of
belief
and
faith
go
to
make
them
and
their
way
of
life
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
sipar
to
have
missed
the
trail
and
swear
it
could
not
find
it
even
from
the
start
it
could
have
refused
to
go
yet
fearing
it
had
gone
reluctant
it
had
trailed
without
any
need
for
faithfulness
and
loyalty
it
had
been
loyal
and
faithful
but
loyal
to
what
duncan
wondered
to
him
the
outlander
and
intruder
loyal
to
itself
or
perhaps
although
that
seemed
impossible
faithful
to
the
cytha
what
does
sipar
think
of
me
he
asked
himself
and
maybe
more
to
the
point
what
do
i
think
of
sipar
is
there
a
common
meeting
ground
or
are
we
despite
our
humanoid
forms
condemned
forever
to
be
alien
and
apart
he
held
the
rifle
across
his
knees
and
stroked
it
polishing
it
petting
it
making
it
even
more
closely
a
part
of
him
an
instrument
of
his
deadliness
an
expression
of
his
determination
to
track
and
kill
the
cytha
just
another
chance
he
begged
just
one
second
or
even
less
to
draw
a
steady
bead
that
is
all
i
want
all
i
need
all
i
ask
then
he
could
go
back
across
the
days
that
he
had
left
behind
him
back
to
the
farm
and
field
back
into
that
misty
other
life
from
which
he
had
been
so
mysteriously
divorced
but
which
in
time
undoubtedly
would
become
real
and
meaningful
again
sipar
came
back
i
found
the
trail
duncan
heaved
himself
to
his
feet
good
they
left
the
river
and
plunged
into
the
forest
and
there
the
heat
closed
in
more
mercilessly
than
ever
humid
stifling
heat
that
felt
like
a
soggy
blanket
wrapped
tightly
round
the
body
the
trail
lay
plain
and
clear
the
cytha
now
it
seemed
was
intent
upon
piling
up
a
lead
without
recourse
to
evasive
tactics
perhaps
it
had
reasoned
that
its
pursuers
would
lose
some
time
at
the
river
and
it
may
have
been
trying
to
stretch
out
that
margin
even
further
perhaps
it
needed
that
extra
time
he
speculated
to
set
up
the
necessary
machinery
for
another
dirty
trick
sipar
stopped
and
waited
for
duncan
to
catch
up
your
knife
mister
duncan
hesitated
what
for
i
have
a
thorn
in
my
foot
the
native
said
i
have
to
get
it
out
duncan
pulled
the
knife
from
his
belt
and
tossed
it
sipar
caught
it
deftly
looking
straight
at
duncan
with
the
flicker
of
a
smile
upon
its
lips
the
native
cut
its
throat
v
he
should
go
back
he
knew
without
the
tracker
he
did
have
a
chance
the
odds
were
now
with
the
cytha
if
indeed
they
had
not
been
with
it
from
the
very
start
unkillable
unkillable
because
it
grew
in
intelligence
to
meet
emergencies
unkillable
because
pressed
it
could
fashion
a
bow
and
arrow
however
crude
unkillable
because
it
had
a
sense
of
tactics
like
rolling
rocks
at
night
upon
its
enemy
unkillable
because
a
native
tracker
would
cheerfully
kill
itself
to
protect
the
cytha
a
sort
of
perhaps
one
able
to
develop
intelligence
and
abilities
to
meet
each
new
situation
and
then
lapsing
back
to
the
level
of
contentment
that
thought
duncan
would
be
a
sensible
way
for
anything
to
live
it
would
do
away
with
the
inconvenience
and
the
irritability
and
the
discontentment
of
intelligence
when
intelligence
was
unneeded
but
the
intelligence
and
the
abilities
which
went
with
it
would
be
there
safely
tucked
away
where
one
could
reach
in
and
get
them
like
a
necklace
or
a
gun
something
to
be
used
or
to
be
put
away
as
the
case
might
be
duncan
hunched
forward
and
with
a
stick
of
wood
pushed
the
fire
together
the
flames
blazed
up
anew
and
sent
sparks
flying
up
into
the
whispering
darkness
of
the
trees
the
night
had
cooled
off
a
little
but
the
humidity
still
hung
on
and
a
man
felt
uncomfortable
a
little
frightened
too
duncan
lifted
his
head
and
stared
up
into
the
darkness
there
were
no
stars
because
the
heavy
foliage
shut
them
out
he
missed
the
stars
he
feel
better
if
he
could
look
up
and
see
them
when
morning
came
he
should
go
back
he
should
quit
this
hunt
which
now
had
become
impossible
and
even
slightly
foolish
but
he
knew
he
would
somewhere
along
the
trail
he
had
become
committed
to
a
purpose
and
a
challenge
and
he
knew
that
when
morning
came
he
would
go
on
again
it
was
not
hatred
that
drove
him
nor
vengeance
nor
even
the
the
that
prodded
men
to
kill
something
strange
or
harder
to
kill
or
bigger
than
any
man
had
ever
killed
before
it
was
something
more
than
that
some
weird
entangling
of
the
cytha
meaning
with
his
own
he
reached
out
and
picked
up
the
rifle
and
laid
it
in
his
lap
its
barrel
gleamed
dully
in
the
flickering
campfire
light
and
he
rubbed
his
hand
along
the
stock
as
another
man
might
stroke
a
woman
throat
mister
said
a
voice
it
did
not
startle
him
for
the
word
was
softly
spoken
and
for
a
moment
he
had
forgotten
that
sipar
was
dead
dead
with
a
fixed
upon
its
face
and
with
its
throat
laid
wide
open
mister
duncan
stiffened
sipar
was
dead
and
there
was
no
one
else
and
yet
someone
had
spoken
to
him
and
there
could
be
only
one
thing
in
all
this
wilderness
that
might
speak
to
him
yes
he
said
he
did
not
move
he
simply
sat
there
with
the
rifle
in
his
lap
you
know
who
i
am
i
suppose
you
are
the
cytha
you
have
done
well
the
cytha
said
you
made
a
splendid
hunt
there
is
no
dishonor
if
you
should
decide
to
quit
why
do
you
go
back
i
promise
you
no
harm
it
was
over
there
somewhere
in
front
of
him
somewhere
in
the
brush
beyond
the
fire
almost
straight
across
the
fire
from
him
duncan
told
himself
if
he
could
keep
it
talking
perhaps
even
lure
it
out
why
should
i
he
asked
the
hunt
is
never
done
until
one
gets
the
thing
one
is
after
i
can
kill
you
the
cytha
told
him
but
i
do
not
want
to
kill
it
hurts
to
kill
that
right
said
duncan
you
are
most
perceptive
for
he
had
it
pegged
now
he
knew
exactly
where
it
was
he
could
afford
a
little
mockery
his
thumb
slid
up
the
metal
and
nudged
the
fire
control
to
automatic
and
he
flexed
his
legs
beneath
him
so
that
he
could
rise
and
fire
in
one
single
motion
why
did
you
hunt
me
the
cytha
asked
you
are
a
stranger
on
my
world
and
you
had
no
right
to
hunt
me
not
that
i
mind
of
course
in
fact
i
found
it
stimulating
we
must
do
it
again
when
i
am
ready
to
be
hunted
i
shall
come
and
tell
you
and
we
can
spend
a
day
or
two
at
it
sure
we
can
said
duncan
rising
and
as
he
rose
into
his
crouch
he
held
the
trigger
down
and
the
gun
danced
in
insane
fury
the
muzzle
flare
a
flicking
tongue
of
hatred
and
the
hail
of
death
hissing
spitefully
in
the
underbrush
anytime
you
want
to
yelled
duncan
gleefully
i
come
and
hunt
you
you
just
say
the
word
and
i
be
on
your
tail
i
might
even
kill
you
how
do
you
like
it
chump
and
he
held
the
trigger
tight
and
kept
his
crouch
so
the
slugs
would
not
fly
high
but
would
cut
their
swath
just
above
the
ground
and
he
moved
the
muzzle
back
and
forth
a
lot
so
that
he
covered
extra
ground
to
compensate
for
any
miscalculations
he
might
have
made
the
magazine
ran
out
and
the
gun
clicked
empty
and
the
vicious
chatter
stopped
powder
smoke
drifted
softly
in
the
campfire
light
and
the
smell
of
it
was
perfume
in
the
nostrils
and
in
the
underbrush
many
little
feet
were
running
as
if
a
thousand
frightened
mice
were
scurrying
from
catastrophe
duncan
unhooked
the
extra
magazine
from
where
it
hung
upon
his
belt
and
replaced
the
empty
one
then
he
snatched
a
burning
length
of
wood
from
the
fire
and
waved
it
frantically
until
it
burst
into
a
blaze
and
became
a
torch
rifle
grasped
in
one
hand
and
the
torch
in
the
other
he
plunged
into
the
underbrush
little
chittering
things
fled
to
escape
him
he
did
not
find
the
cytha
he
found
bushes
and
soil
churned
by
flying
metal
and
he
found
five
lumps
of
flesh
and
fur
and
these
he
brought
back
to
the
fire
now
the
fear
that
had
been
stalking
him
keeping
just
beyond
his
reach
walked
out
from
the
shadows
and
hunkered
by
the
campfire
with
him
he
placed
the
rifle
within
easy
reach
and
arranged
the
five
bloody
chunks
on
the
ground
close
to
the
fire
and
he
tried
with
trembling
fingers
to
restore
them
to
the
shape
they
been
before
the
bullets
struck
them
and
that
was
a
good
one
he
thought
with
grim
irony
because
they
had
no
shape
they
had
been
part
of
the
cytha
and
you
killed
a
cytha
inch
by
inch
not
with
a
single
shot
you
knocked
a
pound
of
meat
off
it
the
first
time
and
the
next
time
you
shot
off
another
pound
or
two
and
if
you
got
enough
shots
at
it
you
finally
carved
it
down
to
size
and
maybe
you
could
kill
it
then
although
he
was
sure
he
was
afraid
he
admitted
that
he
was
and
he
squatted
there
and
watched
his
fingers
shake
and
he
kept
his
jaws
clamped
tight
to
stop
the
chatter
of
his
teeth
the
fear
had
been
getting
closer
all
the
time
he
knew
it
had
moved
in
by
a
step
or
two
when
sipar
cut
its
throat
and
why
in
the
name
of
god
had
the
damn
fool
done
it
it
made
no
sense
at
all
he
had
wondered
about
sipar
loyalties
and
the
very
loyalties
that
he
had
dismissed
as
a
sheer
impossibility
had
been
the
answer
after
all
in
the
end
for
some
obscure
reason
obscure
to
humans
that
is
sipar
loyalty
had
been
to
the
cytha
but
then
what
was
the
use
of
searching
for
any
reason
in
it
nothing
that
had
happened
made
any
sense
it
made
no
sense
that
a
beast
one
was
pursuing
should
up
and
talk
to
one
although
it
did
fit
in
with
the
theory
of
the
he
had
fashioned
in
his
mind
progressive
adaptation
he
told
himself
carry
adaptation
far
enough
and
you
reach
communication
but
might
not
the
cytha
power
of
adaptation
be
running
down
had
the
cytha
gone
about
as
far
as
it
could
force
itself
to
go
maybe
so
he
thought
it
might
be
worth
a
gamble
sipar
suicide
for
all
its
casualness
bore
the
overtones
of
desperation
and
the
cytha
speaking
to
duncan
its
attempt
to
parley
with
him
contained
a
note
of
weakness
the
arrow
had
failed
and
the
rockslide
had
failed
and
so
had
death
what
next
would
the
cytha
try
had
it
anything
to
try
tomorrow
he
find
out
tomorrow
he
go
on
he
could
turn
back
now
he
was
too
deeply
involved
he
always
wonder
if
he
turned
back
now
whether
another
hour
or
two
might
not
have
seen
the
end
of
it
there
were
too
many
questions
too
much
mystery
there
was
now
far
more
at
stake
than
ten
rows
of
another
day
might
make
some
sense
of
it
might
banish
the
dread
walker
that
trod
upon
his
heels
might
bring
some
peace
of
mind
as
it
stood
right
at
the
moment
none
of
it
made
sense
but
even
as
he
thought
it
suddenly
one
of
the
bits
of
bloody
flesh
and
mangled
fur
made
sense
beneath
the
punching
and
prodding
of
his
fingers
it
had
assumed
a
shape
breathlessly
duncan
bent
above
it
not
believing
not
even
wanting
to
believe
hoping
frantically
that
it
should
prove
completely
wrong
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
the
shape
was
there
and
could
not
be
denied
it
had
somehow
fitted
back
into
its
natural
shape
and
it
was
a
baby
screamer
well
maybe
not
a
baby
but
at
least
a
tiny
screamer
duncan
sat
back
on
his
heels
and
sweated
he
wiped
his
bloody
hands
upon
the
ground
he
wondered
what
other
shapes
he
find
if
he
put
back
into
proper
place
the
other
hunks
of
limpness
that
lay
beside
the
fire
he
tried
and
failed
they
were
too
smashed
and
torn
he
picked
them
up
and
tossed
them
in
the
fire
he
took
up
his
rifle
and
walked
around
the
fire
sat
down
with
his
back
against
a
tree
cradling
the
gun
across
his
knees
those
little
scurrying
feet
he
wondered
like
the
scampering
of
a
thousand
busy
mice
he
had
heard
them
twice
that
first
night
in
the
thicket
by
the
waterhole
and
again
tonight
and
what
could
the
cytha
be
certainly
not
the
simple
uncomplicated
marauding
animal
he
had
thought
to
start
with
a
a
host
animal
a
thing
masquerading
in
many
different
forms
shotwell
trained
in
such
deductions
might
make
a
fairly
accurate
guess
but
shotwell
was
not
here
he
was
at
the
farm
fretting
more
than
likely
over
duncan
failure
to
return
finally
the
first
light
of
morning
began
to
filter
through
the
forest
and
it
was
not
the
glaring
clean
white
light
of
the
open
plain
and
bush
but
a
softened
diluted
fuzzy
green
light
to
match
the
smothering
vegetation
the
night
noises
died
away
and
the
noises
of
the
day
took
up
the
sawings
of
unseen
insects
the
screechings
of
hidden
birds
and
something
far
away
began
to
make
a
noise
that
sounded
like
an
empty
barrel
falling
slowly
down
a
stairway
what
little
coolness
the
night
had
brought
dissipated
swiftly
and
the
heat
clamped
down
a
breathless
relentless
heat
that
quivered
in
the
air
circling
duncan
picked
up
the
cytha
trail
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
camp
the
beast
had
been
traveling
fast
the
pug
marks
were
deeply
sunk
and
widely
spaced
duncan
followed
as
rapidly
as
he
dared
it
was
a
temptation
to
follow
at
a
run
to
match
the
cytha
speed
for
the
trail
was
plain
and
fresh
and
it
fairly
beckoned
and
that
was
wrong
duncan
told
himself
it
was
too
fresh
too
plain
almost
as
if
the
animal
had
gone
to
endless
trouble
so
that
the
human
could
not
miss
the
trail
he
stopped
his
trailing
and
crouched
beside
a
tree
and
studied
the
tracks
ahead
his
hands
were
too
tense
upon
the
gun
his
body
keyed
too
high
and
fine
he
forced
himself
to
take
slow
deep
breaths
he
had
to
calm
himself
he
had
to
loosen
up
he
studied
the
tracks
ahead
four
bunched
pug
marks
then
a
long
leap
interval
then
four
more
bunched
tracks
and
between
the
sets
of
marks
the
forest
floor
was
innocent
and
smooth
too
smooth
perhaps
especially
the
third
one
from
him
too
smooth
and
somehow
artificial
as
if
someone
had
patted
it
with
gentle
hands
to
make
it
unsuspicious
duncan
sucked
his
breath
in
slowly
trap
or
was
his
imagination
playing
tricks
on
him
and
if
it
were
a
trap
he
would
have
fallen
into
it
if
he
had
kept
on
following
as
he
had
started
out
now
there
was
something
else
a
strange
uneasiness
and
he
stirred
uncomfortably
casting
frantically
for
some
clue
to
what
it
was
he
rose
and
stepped
out
from
the
tree
with
the
gun
at
ready
what
a
perfect
place
to
set
a
trap
he
thought
one
would
be
looking
at
the
pug
marks
never
at
the
space
between
them
for
the
space
between
would
be
neutral
ground
safe
to
stride
out
upon
oh
clever
cytha
he
said
to
himself
oh
clever
clever
cytha
and
now
he
knew
what
the
other
trouble
was
the
great
uneasiness
it
was
the
sense
of
being
watched
somewhere
up
ahead
the
cytha
was
crouched
watching
and
waiting
anxious
or
exultant
maybe
even
with
laughter
rumbling
in
its
throat
he
walked
slowly
forward
until
he
reached
the
third
set
of
tracks
and
he
saw
that
he
had
been
right
the
little
area
ahead
was
smoother
than
it
should
be
cytha
he
called
his
voice
was
far
louder
than
he
had
meant
it
to
be
and
he
stood
astonished
and
a
bit
abashed
then
he
realized
why
it
was
so
loud
it
was
the
only
sound
there
was
the
forest
suddenly
had
fallen
silent
the
insects
and
birds
were
quiet
and
the
thing
in
the
distance
had
quit
falling
down
the
stairs
even
the
leaves
were
silent
there
was
no
rustle
in
them
and
they
hung
limp
upon
their
stems
there
was
a
feeling
of
doom
and
the
green
light
had
changed
to
a
copper
light
and
everything
was
still
and
the
light
was
duncan
spun
around
in
panic
there
was
no
place
for
him
to
hide
before
he
could
take
another
step
the
came
and
the
winds
rushed
out
of
nowhere
the
air
was
clogged
with
flying
leaves
and
debris
trees
snapped
and
popped
and
tumbled
in
the
air
the
wind
hurled
duncan
to
his
knees
and
as
he
fought
to
regain
his
feet
he
remembered
in
a
blinding
flash
of
total
recall
how
it
had
looked
from
atop
the
escarpment
the
boiling
fury
of
the
winds
and
the
mad
swirling
of
the
coppery
mist
and
how
the
trees
had
whipped
in
whirlpool
fashion
he
came
half
erect
and
stumbled
clawing
at
the
ground
in
an
attempt
to
get
up
again
while
inside
his
brain
an
insistent
clicking
voice
cried
out
for
him
to
run
and
somewhere
another
voice
said
to
lie
flat
upon
the
ground
to
dig
in
as
best
he
could
something
struck
him
from
behind
and
he
went
down
pinned
flat
with
his
rifle
wedged
beneath
him
he
cracked
his
head
upon
the
ground
and
the
world
whirled
sickeningly
and
plastered
his
face
with
a
handful
of
mud
and
tattered
leaves
he
tried
to
crawl
and
could
for
something
had
grabbed
him
by
the
ankle
and
was
hanging
on
with
a
frantic
hand
he
clawed
the
mess
out
of
his
eyes
spat
it
from
his
mouth
across
the
spinning
ground
something
black
and
angular
tumbled
rapidly
it
was
coming
straight
toward
him
and
he
saw
it
was
the
cytha
and
that
in
another
second
it
would
be
on
top
of
him
he
threw
up
an
arm
across
his
face
with
the
elbow
crooked
to
take
the
impact
of
the
cytha
and
to
ward
it
off
but
it
never
reached
him
less
than
a
yard
away
the
ground
opened
up
to
take
the
cytha
and
it
was
no
longer
there
suddenly
the
wind
cut
off
and
the
leaves
once
more
hung
motionless
and
the
heat
clamped
down
again
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
the
had
come
and
struck
and
gone
minutes
duncan
wondered
or
perhaps
no
more
than
seconds
but
in
those
seconds
the
forest
had
been
flattened
and
the
trees
lay
in
shattered
heaps
he
raised
himself
on
an
elbow
and
looked
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
his
foot
and
he
saw
that
a
fallen
tree
had
trapped
his
foot
beneath
it
he
tugged
a
few
times
experimentally
it
was
no
use
two
limbs
branching
almost
at
right
angles
from
the
hole
had
been
driven
deep
into
the
ground
and
his
foot
he
saw
had
been
caught
at
the
ankle
in
the
fork
of
the
buried
branches
the
foot
did
hurt
not
yet
it
did
seem
to
be
there
at
all
he
tried
wiggling
his
toes
and
felt
none
he
wiped
the
sweat
off
his
face
with
a
shirt
sleeve
and
fought
to
force
down
the
panic
that
was
rising
in
him
getting
panicky
was
the
worst
thing
a
man
could
do
in
a
spot
like
this
the
thing
to
do
was
to
take
stock
of
the
situation
figure
out
the
best
approach
then
go
ahead
and
try
it
the
tree
looked
heavy
but
perhaps
he
could
handle
it
if
he
had
to
although
there
was
the
danger
that
if
he
shifted
it
the
bole
might
settle
more
solidly
and
crush
his
foot
beneath
it
at
the
moment
the
two
heavy
branches
thrust
into
the
ground
on
either
side
of
his
ankle
were
holding
most
of
the
tree
weight
off
his
foot
the
best
thing
to
do
he
decided
was
to
dig
the
ground
away
beneath
his
foot
until
he
could
pull
it
out
he
twisted
around
and
started
digging
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
beneath
the
thin
covering
of
humus
he
struck
a
solid
surface
and
his
fingers
slid
along
it
with
mounting
alarm
he
explored
the
ground
scratching
at
the
humus
there
was
nothing
but
rock
some
boulder
the
top
of
which
lay
just
beneath
the
ground
his
foot
was
trapped
beneath
a
heavy
tree
and
a
massive
boulder
held
securely
in
place
by
forked
branches
that
had
forced
their
splintering
way
down
along
the
boulder
sides
he
lay
back
propped
on
an
elbow
it
was
evident
that
he
could
do
nothing
about
the
buried
boulder
if
he
was
going
to
do
anything
his
problem
was
the
tree
to
move
the
tree
he
would
need
a
lever
and
he
had
a
good
stout
lever
in
his
rifle
it
would
be
a
shame
he
thought
a
little
wryly
to
use
a
gun
for
such
a
purpose
but
he
had
no
choice
he
worked
for
an
hour
and
it
was
no
good
even
with
the
rifle
as
a
pry
he
could
not
budge
the
tree
he
lay
back
defeated
breathing
hard
wringing
wet
with
perspiration
he
grimaced
at
the
sky
all
right
cytha
he
thought
you
won
out
in
the
end
but
it
took
a
to
do
it
with
all
your
tricks
you
could
do
the
job
until
then
he
remembered
he
sat
up
hurriedly
cytha
he
called
the
cytha
had
fallen
into
a
hole
that
had
opened
in
the
ground
the
hole
was
less
than
an
arm
length
away
from
him
with
a
little
debris
around
its
edges
still
trickling
into
it
duncan
stretched
out
his
body
lying
flat
upon
the
ground
and
looked
into
the
hole
there
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
the
cytha
it
was
the
first
time
he
gotten
a
good
look
at
the
cytha
and
it
was
a
crazily
thing
it
seemed
to
have
nothing
functional
about
it
and
it
looked
more
like
a
heap
of
something
just
thrown
on
the
ground
than
it
did
an
animal
the
hole
he
saw
was
more
than
an
ordinary
hole
it
was
a
pit
and
very
cleverly
constructed
the
mouth
was
about
four
feet
in
diameter
and
it
widened
to
roughly
twice
that
at
the
bottom
it
was
in
general
with
an
incurving
shoulder
at
the
top
so
that
anything
that
fell
in
could
not
climb
out
anything
falling
into
that
pit
was
in
to
stay
this
duncan
knew
was
what
had
lain
beneath
that
interval
between
the
two
sets
of
cytha
tracks
the
cytha
had
worked
all
night
to
dig
it
then
had
carried
away
the
dirt
dug
out
of
the
pit
and
had
built
a
flimsy
camouflage
cover
over
it
then
it
had
gone
back
and
made
the
trail
that
was
so
loud
and
clear
so
easy
to
make
out
and
follow
and
having
done
all
that
having
labored
hard
and
stealthily
the
cytha
had
settled
down
to
watch
to
make
sure
the
following
human
had
fallen
in
the
pit
hi
pal
said
duncan
how
are
you
making
out
the
cytha
did
not
answer
classy
pit
said
duncan
do
you
always
den
up
in
luxury
like
this
illustration
but
the
cytha
did
answer
illustration
something
queer
was
happening
to
the
cytha
it
was
coming
all
apart
duncan
watched
with
fascinated
horror
as
the
cytha
broke
down
into
a
thousand
lumps
of
motion
that
scurried
in
the
pit
and
tried
to
scramble
up
its
sides
only
to
fall
back
in
tiny
showers
of
sand
amid
the
scurrying
lumps
one
thing
remained
intact
a
fragile
object
that
resembled
nothing
quite
so
much
as
the
stripped
skeleton
of
a
thanksgiving
turkey
but
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
thanksgiving
skeleton
for
it
throbbed
with
pulsing
life
and
glowed
with
a
steady
violet
light
chitterings
and
squeakings
came
out
of
the
pit
and
the
soft
patter
of
tiny
running
feet
and
as
duncan
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
of
the
pit
he
began
to
make
out
the
forms
of
some
of
the
scurrying
shapes
there
were
tiny
screamers
and
some
donovans
and
sawmill
birds
and
a
bevy
of
and
something
else
as
well
duncan
raised
a
hand
and
pressed
it
against
his
eyes
then
took
it
quickly
away
the
little
faces
still
were
there
looking
up
as
if
beseeching
him
with
the
white
shine
of
their
teeth
and
the
white
rolling
of
their
eyes
he
felt
horror
wrenching
at
his
stomach
and
the
sour
bitter
taste
of
revulsion
welled
into
his
throat
but
he
fought
it
down
harking
back
to
that
day
at
the
farm
before
they
had
started
on
the
hunt
i
can
track
down
anything
but
screamers
longhorns
and
donovans
sipar
had
told
him
solemnly
these
are
my
taboos
and
sipar
was
also
their
taboo
for
he
had
not
feared
the
donovan
sipar
had
been
however
somewhat
fearful
of
the
screamers
in
the
dead
of
night
because
the
native
had
told
him
reasonably
screamers
were
forgetful
forgetful
of
what
forgetful
of
the
forgetful
of
the
motley
brood
in
which
they
had
spent
their
childhood
for
that
was
the
only
answer
to
what
was
running
in
the
pit
and
the
whole
unsuspected
answer
to
the
enigma
against
which
men
like
shotwell
had
frustratedly
banged
their
heads
for
years
strange
he
told
himself
all
right
it
might
be
strange
but
if
it
worked
what
difference
did
it
make
so
the
planet
denizens
were
sexless
because
there
was
no
need
of
sex
what
was
wrong
with
that
it
might
in
fact
duncan
admitted
to
himself
head
off
a
lot
of
trouble
no
family
spats
no
triangle
trouble
no
fighting
over
mates
while
it
might
be
unexciting
it
did
seem
downright
peaceful
and
since
there
was
no
sex
the
cytha
species
was
the
planetary
mother
but
more
than
just
a
mother
the
cytha
more
than
likely
was
incubator
nursery
teacher
and
perhaps
many
other
things
besides
all
rolled
into
one
in
many
ways
he
thought
it
might
make
a
lot
of
sense
here
natural
selection
would
be
ruled
out
and
ecology
could
be
controlled
in
considerable
degree
and
mutation
might
even
be
a
matter
of
deliberate
choice
rather
than
random
happenstance
and
it
would
make
for
a
potential
planetary
unity
such
as
no
other
world
had
ever
known
everything
here
was
kin
to
everything
else
here
was
a
planet
where
man
or
any
other
alien
must
learn
to
tread
most
softly
for
it
was
not
inconceivable
that
in
a
crisis
or
a
clash
of
interests
one
might
find
himself
faced
suddenly
with
a
unified
and
cooperating
planet
with
every
form
of
life
making
common
cause
against
the
interloper
the
little
scurrying
things
had
given
up
they
gone
back
to
their
places
clustered
around
the
pulsing
violet
of
the
thanksgiving
skeleton
each
one
fitting
into
place
until
the
cytha
had
taken
shape
again
as
if
duncan
told
himself
blood
and
nerve
and
muscle
had
come
back
from
a
brief
vacation
to
form
the
beast
anew
mister
asked
the
cytha
what
do
we
do
now
you
should
know
duncan
told
it
you
were
the
one
who
dug
the
pit
i
split
myself
the
cytha
said
a
part
of
me
dug
the
pit
and
the
other
part
that
stayed
on
the
surface
got
me
out
when
the
job
was
done
convenient
grunted
duncan
and
it
convenient
that
was
what
had
happened
to
the
cytha
when
he
had
shot
at
it
it
had
split
into
all
its
component
parts
and
had
got
away
and
that
night
beside
the
waterhole
it
had
spied
on
him
again
in
the
form
of
all
its
separate
parts
from
the
safety
of
the
thicket
you
are
caught
and
so
am
i
the
cytha
said
both
of
us
will
die
here
it
seems
a
fitting
end
to
our
association
do
you
not
agree
with
me
i
get
you
out
said
duncan
wearily
i
have
no
quarrel
with
children
he
dragged
the
rifle
toward
him
and
unhooked
the
sling
from
the
stock
carefully
he
lowered
the
gun
by
the
sling
still
attached
to
the
barrel
down
into
the
pit
the
cytha
reared
up
and
grasped
it
with
its
forepaws
easy
now
duncan
cautioned
you
heavy
i
do
know
if
i
can
hold
you
but
he
need
have
worried
the
little
ones
were
detaching
themselves
and
scrambling
up
the
rifle
and
the
sling
they
reached
his
extended
arms
and
ran
up
them
with
scrabbling
claws
little
sneering
screamers
and
the
comic
and
the
that
snarled
at
him
as
they
climbed
and
the
little
grinning
natives
not
babies
scarcely
children
but
small
editions
of
humanoids
and
the
weird
donovans
scampering
happily
they
came
climbing
up
his
arms
and
across
his
shoulders
and
milled
about
on
the
ground
beside
him
waiting
for
the
others
and
finally
the
cytha
not
skinned
down
to
the
bare
bones
of
its
but
far
smaller
than
it
had
been
climbed
awkwardly
up
the
rifle
and
the
sling
to
safety
duncan
hauled
the
rifle
up
and
twisted
himself
into
a
sitting
position
the
cytha
he
saw
was
reassembling
he
watched
in
fascination
as
the
restless
miniatures
of
the
life
swarmed
and
seethed
like
a
hive
of
bees
each
one
clicking
into
place
to
form
the
entire
beast
and
now
the
cytha
was
complete
yet
small
still
small
no
more
than
but
it
is
such
a
little
one
zikkara
had
argued
with
him
that
morning
at
the
farm
it
is
such
a
young
one
just
a
young
brood
no
more
than
suckling
infants
if
suckling
was
the
word
or
even
some
kind
of
wild
approximation
and
through
the
months
and
years
the
cytha
would
grow
with
the
growing
of
its
diverse
children
until
it
became
a
monstrous
thing
it
stood
there
looking
at
duncan
and
the
tree
now
said
duncan
if
you
push
on
the
tree
i
think
that
between
the
two
of
us
it
is
too
bad
the
cytha
said
and
wheeled
itself
about
he
watched
it
go
loping
off
hey
he
yelled
but
it
did
stop
he
grabbed
up
the
rifle
and
had
it
halfway
to
his
shoulder
before
he
remembered
how
absolutely
futile
it
was
to
shoot
at
the
cytha
he
let
the
rifle
down
the
dirty
ungrateful
he
stopped
himself
there
was
no
profit
in
rage
when
you
were
in
a
jam
you
did
the
best
you
could
you
figured
out
the
problem
and
you
picked
the
course
that
seemed
best
and
you
did
panic
at
the
odds
he
laid
the
rifle
in
his
lap
and
started
to
hook
up
the
sling
and
it
was
not
till
then
that
he
saw
the
barrel
was
packed
with
sand
and
dirt
he
sat
numbly
for
a
moment
thinking
back
to
how
close
he
had
been
to
firing
at
the
cytha
and
if
that
barrel
was
packed
hard
enough
or
deep
enough
he
might
have
had
an
exploding
weapon
in
his
hands
he
had
used
the
rifle
as
a
crowbar
which
was
no
way
to
use
a
gun
that
was
one
way
he
told
himself
that
was
guaranteed
to
ruin
it
duncan
hunted
around
and
found
a
twig
and
dug
at
the
clogged
muzzle
but
the
dirt
was
jammed
too
firmly
in
it
and
he
made
little
progress
he
dropped
the
twig
and
was
hunting
for
another
stronger
one
when
he
caught
the
motion
in
a
nearby
clump
of
brush
he
watched
closely
for
a
moment
and
there
was
nothing
so
he
resumed
the
hunt
for
a
stronger
twig
he
found
one
and
started
poking
at
the
muzzle
and
there
was
another
flash
of
motion
he
twisted
around
not
more
than
twenty
feet
away
a
screamer
sat
easily
on
its
haunches
its
tongue
was
lolling
out
and
it
had
what
looked
like
a
grin
upon
its
face
and
there
was
another
just
at
the
edge
of
the
clump
of
brush
where
he
had
caught
the
motion
first
there
were
others
as
well
he
knew
he
could
hear
them
sliding
through
the
tangle
of
fallen
trees
could
sense
the
soft
padding
of
their
feet
the
executioners
he
thought
the
cytha
certainly
had
not
wasted
any
time
he
raised
the
rifle
and
rapped
the
barrel
smartly
on
the
fallen
tree
trying
to
dislodge
the
obstruction
in
the
bore
but
it
did
budge
the
barrel
still
was
packed
with
sand
but
no
matter
he
have
to
fire
anyhow
and
take
whatever
chance
there
was
he
shoved
the
control
to
automatic
and
tilted
up
the
muzzle
there
were
six
of
them
now
sitting
in
a
ragged
row
grinning
at
him
not
in
any
hurry
they
were
sure
of
him
and
there
was
no
hurry
still
be
there
when
they
decided
to
move
in
and
there
were
others
on
all
sides
of
him
once
it
started
he
would
have
a
chance
it
be
expensive
gents
he
told
them
and
he
was
astonished
at
how
calm
how
coldly
objective
he
could
be
now
that
the
chips
were
down
but
that
was
the
way
it
was
he
realized
he
thought
a
while
ago
how
a
man
might
suddenly
find
himself
face
to
face
with
an
aroused
and
cooperating
planet
maybe
this
was
it
in
miniature
the
cytha
had
obviously
passed
the
word
along
back
there
needs
killing
go
and
get
just
like
that
for
a
cytha
would
be
the
power
here
a
life
force
the
giver
of
life
the
decider
of
life
the
repository
of
all
animal
life
on
the
entire
planet
there
was
more
than
one
of
them
of
course
probably
they
had
home
districts
spheres
of
influence
and
responsibility
mapped
out
and
each
one
would
be
a
power
supreme
in
its
own
district
momism
he
thought
with
a
sour
grin
momism
at
its
absolute
peak
nevertheless
he
told
himself
it
was
too
bad
a
system
if
you
wanted
to
consider
it
objectively
but
he
was
in
a
poor
position
to
be
objective
about
that
or
anything
else
the
screamers
were
inching
closer
hitching
themselves
forward
slowly
on
their
bottoms
i
going
to
set
up
a
deadline
for
you
critters
duncan
called
out
just
two
feet
farther
up
to
that
rock
and
i
let
you
have
it
he
get
all
six
of
them
of
course
but
the
shots
would
be
the
signal
for
the
general
rush
by
all
those
other
animals
slinking
in
the
brush
if
he
were
free
if
he
were
on
his
feet
possibly
he
could
beat
them
off
but
pinned
as
he
was
he
did
have
a
chance
it
would
be
all
over
less
than
a
minute
after
he
opened
fire
he
might
he
figured
last
as
long
as
that
the
six
inched
closer
and
he
raised
the
rifle
but
they
stopped
and
moved
no
farther
their
ears
lifted
just
a
little
as
if
they
might
be
listening
and
the
grins
dropped
from
their
faces
they
squirmed
uneasily
and
assumed
a
look
of
guilt
and
like
shadows
they
were
gone
melting
away
so
swiftly
that
he
scarcely
saw
them
go
duncan
sat
quietly
listening
but
he
could
hear
no
sound
reprieve
he
thought
but
for
how
long
something
had
scared
them
off
but
in
a
while
they
might
be
back
he
had
to
get
out
of
here
and
he
had
to
make
it
fast
if
he
could
find
a
longer
lever
he
could
move
the
tree
there
was
a
branch
slanting
up
from
the
topside
of
the
fallen
tree
it
was
almost
four
inches
at
the
butt
and
it
carried
its
diameter
well
he
slid
the
knife
from
his
belt
and
looked
at
it
too
small
too
thin
he
thought
to
chisel
through
a
branch
but
it
was
all
he
had
when
a
man
was
desperate
enough
though
when
his
very
life
depended
on
it
he
would
do
anything
he
hitched
himself
along
sliding
toward
the
point
where
the
branch
protruded
from
the
tree
his
pinned
leg
protested
with
stabs
of
pain
as
his
body
wrenched
it
around
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
pushed
himself
closer
pain
slashed
through
his
leg
again
and
he
was
still
long
inches
from
the
branch
he
tried
once
more
then
gave
up
he
lay
panting
on
the
ground
there
was
just
one
thing
left
he
have
to
try
to
hack
out
a
notch
in
the
trunk
just
above
his
leg
no
that
would
be
next
to
impossible
for
he
be
cutting
into
the
whorled
and
twisted
grain
at
the
base
of
the
supporting
fork
either
that
or
cut
off
his
foot
and
that
was
even
more
impossible
a
man
would
faint
before
he
got
the
job
done
it
was
useless
he
knew
he
could
do
neither
one
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
for
the
first
time
he
admitted
to
himself
he
would
stay
here
and
die
shotwell
back
at
the
farm
in
a
day
or
two
might
set
out
hunting
for
him
but
shotwell
would
never
find
him
and
anyhow
by
nightfall
if
not
sooner
the
screamers
would
be
back
he
laughed
gruffly
in
his
throat
laughing
at
himself
the
cytha
had
won
the
hunt
hands
down
it
had
used
a
human
weakness
to
win
and
then
had
used
that
same
human
weakness
to
achieve
a
viciously
poetic
vengeance
after
all
what
could
one
expect
one
could
not
equate
human
ethics
with
the
ethics
of
the
cytha
might
not
human
ethics
in
certain
cases
seem
as
weird
and
illogical
as
infamous
and
ungrateful
to
an
alien
he
hunted
for
a
twig
and
began
working
again
to
clean
the
rifle
bore
a
crashing
behind
him
twisted
him
around
and
he
saw
the
cytha
behind
the
cytha
stalked
a
donovan
he
tossed
away
the
twig
and
raised
the
gun
no
said
the
cytha
sharply
the
donovan
tramped
purposefully
forward
and
duncan
felt
the
prickling
of
the
skin
along
his
back
it
was
a
frightful
thing
nothing
could
stand
before
a
donovan
the
screamers
had
turned
tail
and
run
when
they
had
heard
it
a
couple
of
miles
or
more
away
the
donovan
was
named
for
the
first
known
human
to
be
killed
by
one
that
first
was
only
one
of
many
the
roll
of
ran
long
and
no
wonder
duncan
thought
it
was
the
closest
he
had
ever
been
to
one
of
the
beasts
and
he
felt
a
coldness
creeping
over
him
it
was
like
an
elephant
and
a
tiger
and
a
grizzly
bear
wrapped
in
the
selfsame
hide
it
was
the
most
vicious
fighting
machine
that
ever
had
been
spawned
he
lowered
the
rifle
there
would
be
no
point
in
shooting
in
two
quick
strides
the
beast
could
be
upon
him
the
donovan
almost
stepped
on
him
and
he
flinched
away
then
the
great
head
lowered
and
gave
the
fallen
tree
a
butt
and
the
tree
bounced
for
a
yard
or
two
the
donovan
kept
on
walking
its
powerfully
muscled
stern
moved
into
the
brush
and
out
of
sight
now
we
are
even
said
the
cytha
i
had
to
get
some
help
duncan
grunted
he
flexed
the
leg
that
had
been
trapped
and
he
could
not
feel
the
foot
using
his
rifle
as
a
cane
he
pulled
himself
erect
he
tried
putting
weight
on
the
injured
foot
and
it
screamed
with
pain
he
braced
himself
with
the
rifle
and
rotated
so
that
he
faced
the
cytha
thanks
pal
he
said
i
did
think
you
do
it
you
will
not
hunt
me
now
duncan
shook
his
head
i
in
no
shape
for
hunting
i
am
heading
home
it
was
the
was
it
that
was
why
you
hunted
me
the
is
my
livelihood
said
duncan
i
can
not
let
you
eat
it
the
cytha
stood
silently
and
duncan
watched
it
for
a
moment
then
he
wheeled
using
the
rifle
for
a
crutch
he
started
hobbling
away
the
cytha
hurried
to
catch
up
with
him
let
us
make
a
bargain
mister
i
will
not
eat
the
and
you
will
not
hunt
me
is
that
fair
enough
that
is
fine
with
me
said
duncan
let
us
shake
on
it
he
put
down
a
hand
and
the
cytha
lifted
up
a
paw
they
shook
somewhat
awkwardly
but
very
solemnly
now
the
cytha
said
i
will
see
you
home
the
screamers
would
have
you
before
you
got
out
of
the
woods
vi
they
halted
on
a
knoll
below
them
lay
the
farm
with
the
rows
straight
and
green
in
the
red
soil
of
the
fields
you
can
make
it
from
here
the
cytha
said
i
am
wearing
thin
it
is
an
awful
effort
to
keep
on
being
smart
i
want
to
go
back
to
ignorance
and
comfort
it
was
nice
knowing
you
duncan
told
it
politely
and
thanks
for
sticking
with
me
he
started
down
the
hill
leaning
heavily
on
the
then
he
frowned
troubledly
and
turned
back
look
he
said
you
go
back
to
animal
again
then
you
will
forget
one
of
these
days
you
see
all
that
nice
tender
and
very
simple
said
the
cytha
if
you
find
me
in
the
just
begin
hunting
me
with
you
after
me
i
will
quickly
get
smart
and
remember
once
again
and
it
will
be
all
right
sure
agreed
duncan
i
guess
that
will
work
the
cytha
watched
him
go
stumping
down
the
hill
admirable
it
thought
next
time
i
have
a
brood
i
think
i
raise
a
dozen
like
him
it
turned
around
and
headed
for
the
deeper
brush
it
felt
intelligence
slipping
from
it
felt
the
old
uncaring
comfort
coming
back
again
but
it
glowed
with
anticipation
seethed
with
happiness
at
the
big
surprise
it
had
in
store
for
its
friend
wo
he
be
happy
and
surprised
when
i
drop
them
at
his
door
it
thought
will
he
be
ever
pleased
