there
a
dangerous
group
of
activists
out
there
who
pose
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
future
of
authors
and
publishing
they
have
no
respect
for
property
or
laws

more
they
powerful

the
ears

they
always
safeguard
this
right
but
ebook
publishers
do
respect
copyright
law
and
they
believe
in
your
right
to

property
instead
they
say
that
when
you

an
ebook

also
if
you
like
it
buy
it
http
or
donate
a
copy
to
a
worthy
institution
http
why
am
i
doing
this
because
my
problem
is
piracy
it
obscurity
thanks
timoreilly
for
this
awesome
aphorism
because
free
ebooks
sell
print
books
because
i
copied
my
ass
off
when
i
was
and
grew
up
to
spend
practically
every
discretionary
cent
i
have
on
books
when
i
became
an
adult
because
i
ca
stop
you
from
sharing
it
zeroes
and
ones
are
ever
going
to
get
harder
to
copy
and
because
readers
have
shared
the
books
they
loved
forever
so
i
might
as
well
enlist
you
to
the
cause
i
have
always
dreamt
of
writing
sf
novels
since
i
was
six
years
old
now
i
do
it
it
is
a
goddamned
dream
come
true
like
growing
up
to
be
a
cowboy
or
an
astronaut
except
that
you
do
get
oppressed
by
ranchers
or
stuck
on
the
launchpad
in
an
adult
diaper
for
hours
at
a
stretch
the
idea
that
i
get
dyspeptic
over
people
celebrating
what
i
write
is
goddamned
so
download
this
book
some
rules
of
the
road
it
kind
of
a
tradition
around
here
that
my
readers
convert
my
ebooks
to
their
favorite
formats
and
send
them
to
me
here
and
it
one
that
i
love
if
you
converted
these
files
to
another
format
send
them
to
me
doctorow
subject
makers
conversion
and
host
them
but
before
you
do
make
sure
you
read
the
following
only
one
conversion
per
format
first
come
first
serve
that
means
that
if
someone
already
converted
the
file
to
a
femellhebber
document
that
the
one
you
going
to
find
here
i
just
know
enough
about
esoteric
readers
to
adjudicate
disputes
about
what
the
ideal
format
is
for
your
favorite
device
make
sure
include
a
link
to
the
reader
as
well
when
you
send
me
an
ebook
file
make
sure
that
you
include
a
link
to
the
website
for
the
reader
technology
as
well
so
that
i
can
include
it
below
no
cover
art
the
text
of
this
book
is
freely
copyable
the
cover
not
so
much
the
rights
to
it
are
controlled
by
my
publisher
so
do
include
it
with
your
file
no
drm
the
creative
commons
license
prohibits
sharing
the
file
with
drm
sometimes
called
on
it
and
that
fine
by
me
do
send
me
the
book
with
drm
on
it
if
you
converting
to
a
format
that
has
a
drm
option
make
sure
it
switched
off
a
word
to
professors
librarians
and
people
who
want
to
donate
money
to
me
every
time
i
put
a
book
online
for
free
i
get
emails
from
readers
who
want
to
send
me
donations
for
the
book
i
appreciate
their
generous
spirit
but
i
not
interested
in
cash
donations
because
my
publishers
are
really
important
to
me
they
contribute
immeasurably
to
the
book
improving
it
introducing
it
to
audience
i
could
never
reach
helping
me
do
more
with
my
work
i
have
no
desire
to
cut
them
out
of
the
loop
but
there
has
to
be
some
good
way
to
turn
that
generosity
to
good
use
and
i
think
i
found
it
here
the
deal
there
are
lots
of
professors
and
librarians
love
to
get
of
this
book
into
their
students
and
hands
but
do
have
the
budget
for
it
there
are
generous
people
who
want
to
send
some
cash
my
way
to
thank
me

suzanne
church
almost
never
had
to
bother
with
the
blue
blazer
these
days
back
at
the
height
of
the
she
put
on
her
business
journalist
drag
blazer
blue
sailcloth
shirt
khaki
trousers
loafers
just
about
every
day
putting
in
her
obligatory
appearances
at
splashy
for
ipos
and
mergers
these
days
it
was
mostly
work
at
home
or
one
day
a
week
at
the
san
jose
mercury
news
office
in
comfortable
light
sweaters
with
loose
necks
and
loose
cotton
pants
that
she
could
wear
straight
to
yoga
after
shutting
her
computer
lid
blue
blazer
today
and
she
was
the
only
one
there
was
reedy
from
the
nyt
silicon
valley
office
and
tribbey
from
the
wsj
and
that
despicable
gossip
columnist
from
one
of
the
uk
and
many
others
besides
old
home
week
blue
blazers
fresh
from
the
bags
that
had
guarded
them
since
the
last
time
the
nasdaq
broke
the
man
of
the
hour
was
landon
kettlewell
the
kind
of
outlandish
name
that
always
seemed
a
little
made
up
to
her
the
new
ceo
and
front
for
the
majority
owners
of
the
despicable
brit
had
already
started
calling
them
kodacell
buying
the
company
was
pure
kettlewell
shrewd
weird
and
ethical
in
a
twisted
way
why
the
hell
have
you
done
this
landon
kettlewell
asked
himself
into
his
ties
and
suits
for
the
new
kodacell
execs
in
the
room
like
surfers
playing
why
buy
two
dinosaurs
and
stick
together
will
they
mate
and
give
birth
to
a
new
generation
of
dinosaurs
he
shook
his
head
and
walked
to
a
different
part
of
the
stage
thumbing
a
powerpoint
remote
that
advanced
his
slide
on
the
jumbotron
to
a
picture
of
a
couple
of
unhappy
cartoon
brontos
staring
desolately
at
an
empty
nest
probably
not
but
there
is
a
good
case
for
what
we
just
done
and
with
your
indulgence
i
going
to
lay
it
out
for
you
now
let
hope
he
sticks
to
the
cartoons
hissed
beside
her
his
breath
smelled
like
he
been
gargling
turds
he
had
a
crush
on
her
and
liked
to
demonstrate
his
by
making
into
her
ear
they
about
his
speed
she
twisted
in
her
seat
and
pointedly
hunched
over
her
screen
to
which
she
taped
a
thin
sheet
of
polarized
plastic
that
made
it
opaque
to
anyone
her
being
a
halfway
attractive
woman
in
silicon
valley
was
more
of
a
pain
in
the
ass
than
she
expected
back
when
she
been
covering
rustbelt
shenanigans
in
detroit
back
when
there
was
an
auto
industry
in
detroit
the
worst
part
was
that
the
brit
reportage
was
just
editorializing
on
the
lack
of
ethics
in
the
valley
a
favorite
subject
of
hers
which
no
doubt
accounted
for
his
and
it
was
also
the
crux
of
kettlewell
schtick
the
spectacle
of
an
exec
who
talked
ethics
enraged
more
than
the
vilest
he
was
the
kind
of
revolutionary
who
liked
his
firing
squads
arranged
in
a
circle
i
not
that
dumb
folks
kettlewell
said
provoking
a
stagey
laugh
from
mr
here
the
thing
the
market
had
valued
these
companies
at
less
than
their
cash
on
hand
they
have
twenty
billion
in
the
bank
and
a
billion
dollar
we
just
made
four
billion
dollars
just
by
buying
up
the
stock
and
taking
control
of
the
company
we
could
shut
the
doors
stick
the
money
in
our
pockets
and
retire
suzanne
took
notes
she
knew
all
this
but
kettlewell
gave
good
and
talked
slow
in
deference
to
the
kind
of
reporter
who
preferred
a
notebook
to
a
recorder
but
we
not
gon
na
do
that
he
hunkered
down
on
his
haunches
at
the
edge
of
the
stage
letting
his
tie
dangle
staring
spacily
at
the
journalists
and
analysts
kodacell
is
bigger
than
that
he
read
his
email
that
morning
then
and
seen
new
moniker
kodacell
has
goodwill
it
has
infrastructure
administrators
physical
plant
supplier
relationships
distribution
and
logistics
these
companies
have
a
lot
of
useful
plumbing
and
a
lot
of
priceless
reputation
what
we
do
have
is
a
product
there
are
enough
buyers
for
batteries
or
film
or
any
of
the
other
stuff
we
make
to
occupy
or
support
all
that
infrastructure
these
companies
slept
through
the
and
the
trundling
along
as
though
none
of
it
mattered
there
are
parts
of
these
businesses
that
have
changed
since
the
fifties
we
not
the
only
ones
technology
has
challenged
and
killed
businesses
from
every
sector
hell
ibm
make
computers
the
very
idea
of
a
travel
agent
is
inconceivably
weird
today
and
the
record
labels
oy
the
poor
crazy
suicidal
stupid
record
labels
do
get
me
started
capitalism
is
eating
itself
the
market
works
and
when
it
works
it
commodifies
or
obsoletes
everything
that
not
to
say
that
there
no
money
out
there
to
be
had
but
the
money
wo
come
from
a
single
monolithic
product
line
the
days
of
companies
with
names
like
electric
and
mills
and
motors
are
over
the
money
on
the
table
is
like
krill
a
billion
little
entrepreneurial
opportunities
that
can
be
discovered
and
exploited
by
smart
creative
people
we
will
the
of
capitalism
in
the
twenty
first
century
our
business
plan
is
simple
we
will
hire
the
smartest
people
we
can
find
and
put
them
in
small
teams
they
will
go
into
the
field
with
funding
and
communications
infrastructure
all
that
stuff
we
have
left
over
from
the
era
of
batteries
and
film
behind
them
capitalized
to
find
a
place
to
live
and
work
and
a
job
to
do
a
business
to
start
our
company
is
a
project
that
we
pull
together
on
it
a
of
cooperating
autonomous
teams
all
of
which
are
empowered
to
do
whatever
they
want
provided
that
it
returns
something
to
our
coffers
we
will
explore
and
exhaust
the
realm
of
commercial
opportunities
and
seek
constantly
to
refine
our
tactics
to
mine
those
opportunities
and
fill
our
hungry
belly
this
company
is
a
company
anymore
this
company
is
a
network
an
approach
a
sensibility
suzanne
fingers
clattered
over
her
keyboard
the
brit
chuckled
nastily
nice
talk
considering
he
just
made
a
hundred
thousand
people
redundant
he
said
suzanne
tried
to
shut
him
out
yes
kettlewell
was
firing
a
company
worth
of
people
but
he
was
also
saving
the
company
itself
the
prospectus
had
a
decent
severance
for
all
those
departing
workers
and
the
ones
who
taken
advantage
of
the
company
plan
would
find
their
pensions
augmented
by
whatever
this
new
scheme
could
rake
in
if
it
worked
mr
kettlewell
had
clambered
to
his
hind
legs
yes
freddy
freddy
was
given
name
though
suzanne
was
hard
pressed
to
ever
retain
it
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
kettlewell
knew
every
in
the
valley
by
name
though
it
was
a
ceo
thing
where
will
you
recruit
this
new
workforce
from
and
what
kind
of
entrepreneurial
things
will
they
be
doing
to
the
realm
of
commercial
activities
freddy
we
do
have
to
recruit
anyone
they
beating
a
path
to
our
door
is
a
nation
of
manic
entrepreneurs
the
kind
of
people
who
been
inventing
businesses
from
video
arcades
to
photomats
for
centuries
freddy
scowled
skeptically
his
jumble
of
grey
tombstone
teeth
protruding

on

ever
hear
of
the
grameen

freddy

he
dug
into
his
and
flung
a
small
object
toward
freddy
who
fumbled
it
it
fell
onto
suzanne
keyboard
she
picked
it
up
it
looked
like
a
keychain
or
maybe
a
novelty
switch
it
on
suzanne
please
and
shine
it
oh
on
that
wall
there
kettlewell
pointed
at
the
upholstered
retractable
wall
that
divided
the
hotel
ballroom
into
two
functional
spaces
suzanne
twisted
the
end
and
pointed
it
a
crisp
rectangle
of
green
lit
up
the
wall
now
watch
this
kettlewell
said
now
watch
this
the

materialized
in
the
middle

donde

where
is
the
bathroom
what
is
it
said
suzanne
her
hand
wobbled
a
little
and
the
distant
letters
danced
what
is
it
this
is
a
new
artifact
designed
and
executed
by
five
previously
engineers
in
athens
georgia
they
mated
a
tiny
linux
box
with
some
continuous
speech
recognition
software
a
free
software
translation
engine
that
can
translate
between
any
of
twelve
languages
and
an
extremely
lcd
that
blocks
out
words
in
the
path
of
the
turn
this
on
point
it
at
a
wall
and
start
talking
everything
said
shows
up
on
the
wall
in
the
language
of
your
choosing
regardless
of
what
language
the
speaker
was
speaking
all
the
while
kettlewell
words
were
scrolling
by
in
black
block
caps
on
that
distant
wall
crisp
letters
this
thing
was
invented
all
the
parts
necessary
to
make
this
go
were
just
lying
around
it
was
a
gal
in
a
garage
her
brother
the
marketing
guy
her
husband
overseeing
manufacturing
in
belgrade
they
needed
a
couple
grand
to
get
it
all
going
and
need
some
while
they
find
their
natural
market
they
got
twenty
grand
from
kodacell
this
week
half
of
it
a
loan
half
of
it
equity
and
we
put
them
on
the
payroll
with
benefits
they
part
freelancer
part
employee
in
a
team
with
backing
and
advice
from
across
the
whole
business
it
was
easy
to
do
once
we
going
to
do
it
ten
thousand
times
this
year
we
sending
out
talent
scouts
like
the
artists
and
representation
people
the
record
labels
used
to
use
and
they
going
to
sign
up
a
lot
of
these
bands
for
us
and
help
them
to
cut
records
to
start
businesses
that
push
out
to
the
edges
of
business
so
freddy
to
answer
your
question
no
we
not
giving
them
loans
to
buy
cellphones
and
goats
kettlewell
beamed
suzanne
twisted
the
off
and
made
ready
to
toss
it
back
to
the
stage
but
kettlewell
waved
her
off
keep
it
he
said
it
was
suddenly
odd
to
hear
him
speak
without
the
text
crawl
on
that
distant
wall
she
put
the
laser
pointer
in
her
pocket
and
reflected
that
it
had
the
authentic
feel
of
cool
disposable
technology
the
kind
of
thing
on
its
way
from
a
distant
supplier
to
the
schwag
bags
at
technology
conferences
to
of
six
hanging
in
the
impulse
aisle
at
fry
she
tried
to
imagine
the
technology
conferences
she
been
to
with
the
addition
of
the
subtitling
and
translation
and
could
do
it
not
conferences
something
else
a
kids
toy
a
tool
for
planning
strategy
before
a
wto
riot
she
patted
her
pocket
freddy
hissed
and
bubbled
like
a
teakettle
beside
her
fuming
what
a
cock
he
muttered
thinks
he
going
to
hire
ten
thousand
teams
to
replace
his
workforce
does
say
a
word
about
what
lot
is
meant
to
be
doing
now
he
shitcanned
them
all
utter
bullshit
irrational
exuberance
gone
berserk
suzanne
had
a
perverse
impulse
to
turn
the
wand
back
on
and
splash
freddy
bilious
words
across
the
ceiling
and
the
thought
made
her
giggle
she
suppressed
it
and
kept
on
piling
up
notes
thinking
about
the
structure
of
the
story
she
file
that
day
kettlewell
pulled
out
some
charts
and
another
surfer
in
a
suit
came
forward
to
talk
money
walking
them
through
the
financials
she
read
them
already
and
decided
that
they
were
a
pretty
credible
bit
of
fiction
so
she
let
her
mind
wander
she
was
a
hundred
miles
away
when
the
ballroom
doors
burst
open
and
the
unionized
laborers
of
the
former
kodak
and
the
former
duracell
poured
in
on
them
tossing
literature
into
the
air
so
that
it
snowed
angry
leaflets
they
had
a
big
drum
and
a
bugle
and
they
shook
tambourines
the
hotel
occasionally
darted
forward
and
grabbed
a
protestor
by
the
arm
but
her
colleagues
would
immediately
swarm
them
and
pry
her
loose
and
drag
her
back
into
the
body
of
the
demonstration
freddy
grinned
and
shouted
something
at
kettlewell
but
it
was
lost
in
the
din
the
journalists
took
a
lot
of
pictures
suzanne
closed
her
computer
lid
and
snatched
a
leaflet
out
of
the
air
what
about
us
it
began
and
talked
about
the
workers
who
been
at
kodak
and
duracell
for
twenty
thirty
even
forty
years
who
had
been
conspicuously
absent
from
kettlewell
stated
plans
to
date
she
twisted
the
to
life
and
pointed
it
back
at
the
wall
leaning
in
very
close
she
said
what
are
your
plans
for
your
existing
workforce
mr
kettlewell
what
are
your
plans
for
your
existing
workforce
mr
kettlewell
she
repeated
the
question
several
times
refreshing
the
text
so
that
it
scrolled
like
a
stock
ticker
across
that
upholstered
wall
an
illuminated
focus
that
gradually
drew
all
the
attention
in
the
room
the
protestors
saw
it
and
began
to
laugh
then
they
read
it
aloud
in
ragged
unison
until
it
became
a
chant
what
are
your
plans
of
the
big
drum
for
your
existing
workforce
mr
kettlewell
suzanne
felt
her
cheeks
warm
kettlewell
was
looking
at
her
with
something
like
a
smile
she
liked
him
but
that
was
a
personal
thing
and
this
was
a
truth
thing
she
was
a
little
embarrassed
that
she
had
let
him
finish
his
spiel
without
calling
him
on
that
obvious
question
she
felt
tricked
somehow
well
she
was
making
up
for
it
now
on
the
stage
the
in
suits
were
confabbing
holding
their
thumbs
over
their
finally
kettlewell
stepped
up
and
held
up
his
own
painting
another
rectangle
of
light
beside
suzanne
i
glad
you
asked
that
suzanne
he
said
his
voice
barely
audible
i
glad
you
asked
that
suzanne
the
journalists
chuckled
even
the
chanters
laughed
a
little
they
quieted
down
i
tell
you
there
a
downside
to
living
in
this
age
of
wonders
we
are
moving
too
fast
and
outstripping
the
ability
of
our
institutions
to
keep
pace
with
the
changes
in
the
world
freddy
leaned
over
her
shoulder
blowing
in
her
ear
translation
you
the
lot
of
you
translation
your
ass
fucked
the
lot
of
you
suzanne
yelped
as
the
words
appeared
on
the
wall
and
reflexively
swung
the
pointer
around
painting
them
on
the
ceiling
the
opposite
wall
and
then
finally
in
miniature
on
her
computer
lid
she
twisted
the
pointer
off
freddy
had
the
decency
to
look
slightly
embarrassed
and
he
slunk
away
to
the
very
end
of
the
row
of
seats
scooting
from
chair
to
chair
on
his
narrow
butt
on
stage
kettlewell
was
pretending
very
hard
that
he
had
seen
the
profanity
and
that
he
could
hear
the
jeering
from
the
protestors
now
even
though
it
had
grown
so
loud
that
he
could
no
longer
be
heard
over
it
he
kept
on
talking
and
the
words
scrolled
over
the
far
wall
there
is
no
world
in
which
kodak
and
duracell
go
on
making
film
and
batteries
the
companies
have
money
in
the
bank
but
it
hemorrhages
out
the
door
every
day
we
are
making
things
that
no
one
wants
to
buy
this
plan
includes
a
generous
severance
for
those
staffers
working
in
the
parts
of
the
business
that
will
close
down
suzanne
admired
the
twisted
way
of
saying
the
people
we
firing
pure
ceo
passive
voice
she
could
type
notes
and
read
off
the
wall
at
the
same
time
she
whipped
out
her
little
snapshot
and
monkeyed
with
it
until
it
was
in
video
mode
and
then
started
shooting
the
ticker
but
if
we
are
to
make
good
on
that
severance
we
need
to
be
in
business
we
need
to
be
bringing
in
a
profit
so
that
we
can
meet
our
obligations
to
all
our
stakeholders
shareholders
and
workforce
alike
we
ca
pay
a
penny
in
severance
if
we
bankrupt
we
are
hiring
new
employees
this
year
and
there
nothing
that
says
that
those
new
people
ca
come
from
within
current
employees
will
be
given
consideration
by
our
scouts
entrepreneurship
is
a
deeply
american
practice
and
our
workers
are
as
capable
of
entrepreneurial
action
as
anyone
i
am
confident
we
will
find
many
of
our
new
hires
from
within
our
existing
workforce
i
say
this
to
our
employees
if
you
have
ever
dreamed
of
striking
out
on
your
own
executing
on
some
amazing
idea
and
never
found
the
means
to
do
it
now
is
the
time
and
we
are
the
people
to
help
suzanne
could
help
but
admire
the
pluck
it
took
to
keep
speaking
into
the
pointer
despite
the
howls
and
bangs
i
gon
na
grab
some
bagels
before
the
protestors
get
to
them
freddy
said
plucking
at
her
arm
apparently
this
was
his
version
of
a
charming
pickup
line
she
shook
him
off
authoritatively
with
a
of
her
elbow
freddy
stood
there
for
a
minute
and
then
moved
off
she
waited
to
see
if
kettlewell
would
say
anything
more
but
he
twisted
the
pointer
off
shrugged
and
waved
at
the
hooting
protestors
and
the
analysts
and
the
journalists
and
walked
with
the
rest
of
the
surfers
in
suits
she
got
some
comments
from
a
few
of
the
protestors
some
details

for

or
duracell

their
lives
gave
everything

she
been
full
of
that

optimism
the
sense
that
there
was
a
better
world
around
her
now
she
was
back
in
that
old
rustbelt
funk
with
the
feeling
that
she
was
witness
not
to
a
beginning
but
to
a
perpetual
ending
a
cycle
of
destruction
that
would
tear
down
everything
solid
and
reliable
in

she
packed
up
her
laptop
and
stepped
out
into
the
parking
lot
across
the
freeway
she
could
make
out
the
bones
of
the
great

whipping
around
and
around
in

warm
california
sun

little
down

people
were
miles
north
on

streets
of
san

where
pedestrian
marks
for
panhandling
could
be
had
where
the
crack
was
sold
on
corners
instead
of
out
of
the
trunks
of

cars

was

she
was
getting
melancholy
she
did
want
to
go
into
the
office
not
today
not
when
she
was
in
this
kind
of
mood
she
would
go
home
and
put
her
blazer
back
in
the
closet
and
change
into
yoga
togs
and
write
her
column
and
have
some
good
coffee
she
nailed
up
the
copy
in
an
hour
and
emailed
it
to
her
editor
and
poured
herself
a
glass
of
napa
red
the
local
vintages
in
michigan
likewise
left
something
to
be
desired
and
settled
onto
her
porch
overlooking
the
big
reservoir
off
near
san
mateo
the
house
had
been
worth
a
small
fortune
at
the
start
of
the
but
now
in
the
resurgent
property
boom
it
was
worth
a
large
fortune
and
then
some
she
could
conceivably
sell
this
badly
built
little
shack
with
its
leaky
for
enough
money
to
retire
on
if
she
wanted
to
live
out
the
rest
of
her
days
in
sri
lanka
or
nebraska
you
got
no
business
feeling
poorly
young
lady
she
said
to
herself
you
are
as
well
as
you
could
have
dreamed
and
you
are
right
in
the
thick
of
the
weirdest
and
best
time
the
world
has
yet
seen
and
landon
kettlewell
knows
your
name
she
finished
the
wine
and
opened
her
computer
it
was
dark
enough
now
with
the
sun
set
behind
the
hills
that
she
could
read
the
screen
the
web
was
full
of
interesting
things
her
email
full
of
challenging
notes
from
her
readers
and
her
editor
had
already
signed
off
on
her
column
she
was
getting
ready
to
shut
the
lid
and
head
for
bed
so
she
pulled
her
mail
once
more
from
to
schurch
subject
embedded
journalist
thanks
for
keeping
me
honest
today
suzanne
it
the
hardest
question
we
facing
today
what
happens
when
all
the
things
you
good
at
are
no
good
to
anyone
anymore
i
hope
we
going
to
answer
that
with
the
new
model
you
do
good
work
madam
i
be
honored
if
you
consider
joining
one
of
our
little
teams
for
a
couple
months
and
chronicling
what
they
do
i
feel
like
we
making
history
here
and
we
need
someone
to
chronicle
it
i
do
know
if
you
can
square
this
with
the
merc
and
i
suppose
that
we
should
be
doing
this
through
my
pr
people
and
your
editor
but
there
comes
a
time
about
this
time
every
night
when
i
just
too
goddamned
hyper
to
bother
with
all
that
stuff
and
i
want
to
just
do
something
instead
of
ask
someone
else
to
start
a
process
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
someday
possibly
maybe
doing
something
will
you
do
something
with
us
if
we
can
make
it
work
percent
access
no
oversight
say
you
will
please
your
pal
kettlebelly
she
stared
at
her
screen
it
was
like
a
work
of
art
just
look
at
that
return
address
for
to
be
live
and
accepting
mail
it
had
to
have
been
registered
the
day
before
she
had
a
vision
of
kettlewell
checking
his
email
at
midnight
before
his
big
catching
column
and
registering
on
the
spot
then
waking
up
some
sysadmin
to
get
a
mail
server
answering
at
last
she
heard
was
threatening
to
sue
anyone
who
used
their
trademarked
term
skunk
works
to
describe
a
generic
r
d
department
that
meant
that
kettlewell
had
moved
so
fast
that
he
had
even
run
this
project
by
legal
she
was
willing
to
bet
that
he
already
ordered
new
with
the
address
on
them
there
was
a
guy
she
knew
an
editor
at
a
mag
who
assigned
himself
a
plum
article
that
he
run
on
his
own
cover
he
gotten
a
out
of
it
a
dollar
if
kettlewell
was
right
then
the
exclusive
book
on
the
inside
of
the
first
year
at
kodacell
could
easily
make
that
advance
and
the
props
would
be
mad
as
the
kids
said
kettlebelly
it
was
such
a
stupid
nickname
but
it
made
her
smile
he
was
taking
himself
seriously
or
maybe
he
was
but
he
was
being
a
pompous
ass
about
it
he
was
serious
about
changing
the
world
and
frivolous
about
everything
else
she
have
a
hard
time
being
an
objective
reporter
if
she
said
yes
to
this
she
could
possibly
decide
at
this
hour
she
needed
a
night
sleep
and
she
had
to
talk
this
over
with
the
merc
if
she
had
a
boyfriend
she
have
to
talk
it
over
with
him
but
that
was
a
problem
in
her
life
these
days
she
spread
on
some
expensive
french
and
brushed
her
teeth
and
put
on
her
nightie
and
the
door
locks
and
did
all
the
normal
things
she
did
of
an
evening
then
she
folded
back
her
sheets
plumped
her
pillows
and
stared
at
them
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
stalked
back
to
her
computer
and
thumped
the
spacebar
until
the
thing
woke
from
sleep
from
schurch
to
subject
re
embedded
journalist
kettlebelly
that
is
one
dumb
nickname
i
could
possibly
associate
myself
with
a
grown
man
who
calls
himself
kettlebelly
so
stop
calling
yourself
kettlebelly
immediately
if
you
can
do
that
we
got
a
deal
suzanne
there
had
come
a
day
when
her
readers
acquired
email
and
the
paper
ran
her
address
with
her
byline
and
her
readers
had
begun
to
write
her
and
write
her
and
write
her
some
were
amazing
informative
thoughtful
notes
some
were
the
vilest
most
bilious
trolling
in
order
to
deal
with
these
notes
she
had
taught
herself
to
pause
breathe
and
any
email
message
before
clicking
send
the
reflex
kicked
in
now
and
she
her
note
to
kettlebelly
kettlewell
and
felt
a
crimp
in
her
guts
then
she
hit
send
she
needed
to
pee
and
apparently
had
done
for
some
time
without
realizing
it
she
was
on
the
toilet
when
she
heard
the
ping
of
new
incoming
mail
from
to
schurch
subject
re
embedded
journalist
i
will
never
call
myself
kettlebelly
again
your
pal
kettledrum
she
did
a
little
at
her
edge
tomorrow
she
go
see
her
editor
about
this
but
it
just
felt
and
exciting
like
she
was
on
the
brink
of
an
event
that
would
change
her
life
forever
it
took
her
three
hours
of
mindless
including
a
truly
dreary
clicktrance
and
an
hour
worth
of
fiddling
with
tweets
from
the
before
she
was
able
to
lull
herself
to
sleep
as
she
nodded
off
she
thought
that
kettlewell
insomnia
was
as
contagious
as
his
excitement
hollywood
florida
biggest
junkyard
was
situated
in
the
rubble
of
a
off
taft
street
suzanne
miami
airport
rental
car
came
with
a
gps
but
the
little
box
had
ever
heard
of
the
mall
it
was
off
the
map
so
she
took
a
moment
in
the
sweltering
of
her
coffin
hotel
to
call
her
interview
subject
again
and
get
better
coordinates
yeah
it
they
never
finished
building
the
mall
so
the
address
has
been
included
in
the
usgs
maps
the
open
gpses
all
have
these
better
maps
made
by
geohackers
but
the
rental
car
companies
have
got
a
real
for
official
morons
hang
on
lem
me
get
my
gps
out
and
i
get
you
some
decent
his
voice
had
a
pleasant
youthful
midwestern
sound
like
a
canadian
newscaster
friendly
and
enthusiastic
as
a
puppy
his
name
was
perry
gibbons
and
if
kettlewell
was
to
be
believed
he
was
the
most
promising
prospect
identified
by
kodacell
the
was
just
one
of
many
along
taft
street
ranging
in
size
from
little
corner
plazas
to
gigantic
palaces
with
atria
and
cracked
parking
lots
a
lot
of
the
malls
in
california
had
crashed
but
they
been
turned
into
or
or
if
been
abandoned
they
had
been
abandoned
like
this
left
to
go
to
ruin
this
reminded
her
of
detroit
before
she
left
whole
swaths
of
the
inner
city
emptied
of
people
neighborhoods
condemned
and
bulldozed
and
in
a
couple
of
weird
cases
actually
by
enterprising
who
planted
crops
kept
livestock
and
rode
their
mini
tractors
beneath
the
beam
of
the
defunct
monorail
the
other
commonality
this
stretch
of
road
shared
with
detroit
was
the
obesity
of
the
people
she
passed
she
felt
a
little
that
morning
dressing
in
a
light
blouse
and
a
pair
of
shorts
nothing
else
would
do
the
weather
was
so
hot
and
drippy
that
even
shoes
would
have
been
intolerable
at
her
legs
had
slight
cellulite
saddlebags
and
her
tummy
was
the
washboard
it
had
been
when
she
was
but
here
on
this
stretch
of
road
populated
by
people
so
fat
they
could
barely
walk
so
fat
that
they
were
marshmallows
with
faces
like
inflatable
toys
she
felt
like
a
toothpick
the
gps
queeped
when
she
came
up
on
the
junkyard
a
sprawling
discount
mall
whose
walls
had
been
used
to
parcel
out
different
kinds
of
sorted
waste
the
mall
had
been
planned
with
wide
indoor
boulevards
between
the
shops
wide
enough
for
two
lanes
of
traffic
and
she
cruised
those
lanes
now
in
the
hertzmobile
looking
for
a
human
once
she
reached
the
center
of
the
mall
a
dry
fountain
filled
with
dusty
ornaments
she
stopped
and
leaned
on
the
horn
she
got
out
of
the
car
and
called
hello
perry
she
could
have
phoned
him
but
it
always
seemed
so
wasteful
spending
money
on
airtime
when
you
were
trying
to
talk
to
someone
within
shouting
range
suzanne
the
voice
came
from
her
left
she
shielded
her
eyes
from
the
sun
glare
and
peered
down
a
spoke
of
and
caught
her
first
glimpse
of
perry
gibbons
he
was
standing
in
the
basket
of
a
tall
barechested
and
brown
he
wore
a
and
big
work
gloves
and
big
baggy
shorts
whose
pockets
jangled
as
he
shinnied
down
the
crane
neck
she
started
toward
him
tentatively
not
a
lot
of
assignments
involved
spending
time
with
dudes
in
remote
southern
junkyards
still
he
sounded
nice
hello
she
called
he
was
young
or
and
already
had
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
he
had
a
brace
on
one
wrist
and
his
boots
were
the
mottled
grey
of
a
on
the
floor
of
a
muffler
and
brake
shop
he
grinned
and
tugged
off
a
glove
stuck
out
his
hand
a
pleasure
sorry
for
the
trouble
finding
this
place
it
not
easy
to
get
to
but
it
cheap
as
hell
i
believe
it
she
looked
around
again
the
heaps
of
interesting
trash
the
filled
with
thousands
of
shining
ornaments
the
smell
was
a
mixture
of
and
salt
jungle
air
florida
swamp
and
detroit
steel
so
this
place
is
pretty
cool
looks
like
you
got
pretty
much
everything
you
could
imagine
and
then
some
this
was
spoken
by
another
man
one
who
puffed
heavily
up
from
behind
her
he
was
enormous
not
just
tall
but
fat
as
big
around
as
a
barrel
his
green
read
it
fun
to
use
learning
for
evil
in
blocky
pixelated
letters
he
took
her
hand
and
shook
it
i
love
your
blog
he
said
i
read
it
all
the
time
he
had
three
chins
and
eyes
that
were
nearly
lost
in
his
apple
cheeks

my

lester

huge

she
chuckled
nerd

ar

let

you
wan
na
see
what
i
do

perry
said
that
right
suzanne
said
lead
the
way
lester
perry
said
and
gestured
with
an
arm
deep
into
the
center
of
the
junkpile
all
right
check
this
stuff
out
as
we
go
he
stuck
his
hand
through
the
unglazed
window
of
a
shop
and
plucked
out
a
toy
in
a
battered
box
i
love
these
things
he
said
handing
it
to
her
she
took
it
it
was
a
sesame
street
elmo
doll
labeled
boogie
woogie
elmo
that
from
the
great
elmo
crash
perry
said
taking
back
the
box
and
expertly
extracting
the
elmo
like
he
was
shelling
a
nut
the
last
and
greatest
generation
of
elmoid
technology
cast
into
an
uncaring
world
that
bought
millions
of
tagger
washable
graffiti
kits
instead
after
rosie
gave
them
two
thumbs
up
on
her
christmas
shopping
guide
poor
elmo
was
an
orphan
and
every
junkyard
in
the
world
has
mountains
of
bwes
getting
rained
on
waiting
to
start
their
long
decomposition
but
check
this
out
he
flicked
a
multitool
off
his
belt
and
extracted
a
short
sharp
he
slit
the
grinning
elmo
open
from
chin
to
groin
and
shucked
its
furry
exterior
and
the
foam
tissue
that
overlaid
its
skeleton
he
slid
the
blade
under
the
plastic
cover
on
its
ass
and
revealed
a
little
printed
circuit
board
that
an
entire
atom
processor
on
a
chip
there
he
said
each
limb
and
the
head
have
their
own
subcontrollers
there
a
rig
for
letting
him
sing
and
dance
to
new
songs
and
an
converter
array
for
converting
spoken
and
danced
commands
to
motions
basically
you
dance
and
sing
for
elmo
and
he
dance
and
sing
back
for
you
suzanne
nodded
she
missed
that
toy
which
was
a
pity
she
had
a
five
year
old
goddaughter
in
minneapolis
who
would
have
loved
a
boogie
woogie
elmo
they
had
come
to
a
giant
barn
set
at
the
edge
of
a
worth
of
anchor
store
this
used
to
be
where
the
contractors
kept
their
heavy
equipment
lester
rumbled
aiming
a
remote
at
the
door
which
queeped
and
opened
inside
it
was
cool
and
bright
the
chugging
efficiently
blasting
purified
air
over
the
many
the
barn
was
a
good
feet
tall
with
a
loft
and
a
catwalk
circling
it
halfway
up
it
was
lined
with
metallic
shelves
stacked
neatly
with
labeled
boxes
of
parts
scrounged
from
the
junkyard
perry
set
elmo
down
on
a
workbench
and
worked
a
miniature
usb
cable
into
his
the
other
end
terminated
with
a
pda
with
a
small
rubberized
photovoltaic
cell
on
the
front
this
thing
is
running
installparty
it
can
recognize
any
hardware
and
build
and
install
a
linux
distro
on
it
without
human
intervention
they
used
a
ton
of
different
suppliers
for
the
bwe
so
every
one
is
a
little
different
depending
on
who
was
offering
the
cheapest
parts
the
day
it
was
built
installparty
does
care
though
and
away
it
goes
the
pda
was
doing
all
kinds
of
funny
dances
on
its
screen
montages
of
playful
photoshopping
of
public
figures
matted
into
historical
fine
art
all
done
now
have
a
look
this
is
a
linux
computer
with
some
of
the
most
advanced
robotics
ever
engineered
no
sweatshop
stuff
either
see
this
the
solder
is
too
precise
to
be
done
by
hand
that
because
it
from
india
if
it
was
from
cambodia
you
see
all
kinds
of
wobble
in
the
solder
that
means
that
tiny
clever
hands
were
used
to
create
it
which
means
that
somewhere
in
the
device
karmic
history
there
a
sweatshop
full
of
crippled
children
inhaling
solder
fumes
until
they
keel
over
and
are
dumped
in
a
ditch
this
is
the
good
stuff
so
we
have
this
karmically
clean
robot
with
infinitely
malleable
computation
and
a
bunch
of
robotic
capabilities
i
turned
these
things
into
monkeys
i
modded
them
for
a
woman
from
the
university
of
miami
at
the
jackson
memorial
who
used
their
capability
to
ape
human
motions
in
physiotherapy
programs
with
cases
but
the
best
thing
i
done
with
them
so
far
is
the
distributed
boogie
woogie
elmo
motor
vehicle
operation
cluster
come
on
he
said
and
took
off
deeper
into
the
depths
they
came
to
a
dusty
smart
car
one
of
those
tiny
electric
cars
you
could
literally
buy
out
of
a
vending
machine
in
europe
it
was
barely
recognizable
having
been
reduced
to
its
and
a
gang
of
naked
robot
elmos
were
piled
into
it
wake
up
boys
time
for
a
demo
perry
shouted
and
they
sat
up
and
made
canned
tinny
elmo
oh
boy
noises
climbing
into
position
on
the
pedals
around
the
wheel
and
on
the
i
got
the
idea
when
i
was
teaching
an
elmo
to
play
mario
brothers
i
thought
it
get
a
decent
diggdotting
i
could
get
it
to
speedrun
all
of
the
first
level
using
an
old
paddle
i
found
and
rehabilitated
and
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
next
the
dead
mall
across
the
way
is
a
theater
and
i
was
out
front
watching
the
silent
movies
and
one
of
them
showed
all
these
cute
little
furry
animated
whatevers
collectively
driving
a
car
it
a
really
old
i
mean
like
racial
memory
old
i
seen
the
little
rascals
do
the
same
bit
with
alfalfa
on
the
wheel
and
buckwheat
and
spanky
on
the
brake
and
clutch
and
the
doggy
working
the
gearshift
and
i
thought
shit
i
could
do
that
with
elmos
they
do
have
any
networking
capability
but
they
can
talk
and
they
can
parse
spoken
commands
so
all
i
need
is
to
designate
one
for
left
and
one
for
right
and
one
for
fast
and
one
for
slow
and
one
to
be
the
eyes
barking
orders
and
they
should
be
able
to
do
this
and
it
works
they
even
adjust
their
balance
and
centers
of
gravity
when
the
car
swerves
to
stay
upright
at
their
posts
check
it
out
he
turned
to
the
car
driving
elmos
they
snapped
upright
and
ticked
salutes
off
their
naked
plastic
noggins
in
circles
drive
he
called
the
elmos
scrambled
into
position
and
fired
up
the
car
and
in
short
order
they
were
doing
donuts
in
the
car
little
indoor
pasture
elmos
halt
perry
shouted
and
the
car
stopped
silently
rocking
gently
stand
down
the
elmos
sat
down
with
a
series
of
tiny
thumps
suzanne
found
herself
applauding
that
was
amazing
she
said
really
impressive
so
that
what
you
going
to
do
for
kodacell
make
these
things
out
of
recycled
toys
lester
chuckled
nope
not
quite
that
just
for
starters
the
elmos
are
all
about
the
universal
availability
of
cycles
and
apparatus
everywhere
you
look
there
devices
for
free
that
have
everything
you
need
to
make
anything
do
anything
but
have
a
look
at
part
two
he
lumbered
off
in
another
direction
and
suzanne
and
perry
trailed
along
behind
him
this
is
lester
workshop
perry
said
as
they
passed
through
a
set
of
swinging
double
doors
and
into
a
cluttered
wonderland
where
perry
domain
had
been
clean
and
neatly
organized
lester
area
was
a
happy
shambles
his
shelves
were
orderly
but
rather
crammed
with
looming
piles
of
amazing
junk
wedding
dresses
plaster
statues
of
bowling
monkeys
box
kites
tin
seashells
painted
with
american
flags
presidential
paste
jewelry
and
antique
tins
you
know
how
they
say
a
sculptor
starts
with
a
block
of
marble
and
chips
away
everything
that
does
look
like
a
statue
like
he
can
the
statue
in
the
block
i
get
like
that
with
garbage
i
see
the
pieces
on
the
heaps
and
in
roadside
trash
and
i
can
just
how
it
can
go
together
like
this
he
reached
down
below
a
and
hoisted
up
a
huge
triptych
made
out
of
three
hinged
stood
on
end
carefully
he
unfolded
it
and
stood
it
like
a
screen
on
the
cracked
concrete
floor
the
inside
of
the
had
been
stripped
clean
and
polished
to
a
high
metal
gleam
that
glowed
like
sterling
silver
to
it
were
all
manner
of
soda
tins
pounded
flat
and
cut
into
gears
chutes
springs
and
other
mechanical
apparatus
it
a
mechanical
calculator
he
said
proudly
about
half
as
powerful
as
univac
i
milled
all
the
parts
using
a
what
you
do
is
fill
this
hopper
with
gi
joe
heads
and
this
hopper
with
barbie
heads
crank
this
wheel
and
it
will
drop
a
number
of
m
ms
equal
to
the
product
of
the
two
values
into
this
hopper
here
he
put
three
scuffed
gi
joe
heads
in
one
hopper
and
four
scrofulous
barbies
in
another
and
began
to
crank
slowly
a
beside
the
crank
played
a
slow
irregular
rendition
of
pop
goes
the
weasel
while
the
hundreds
of
little
gears
turned
flipping
switches
and
adding
and
removing
tension
to
springs
after
the
weasel
popped
a
few
times
twelve
brown
m
ms
fell
into
an
outstretched
rubber
hand
he
picked
them
out
carefully
and
offered
them
to
her
it
ok
not
from
the
trash
he
said
i
buy
them
in
bulk
he
turned
his
broad
back
to
her
and
heaved
a
huge
galvanized
tin
washtub
full
of
brown
m
ms
in
her
direction
see
it
a
he
said
suzanne
giggled
in
spite
of
herself
you
guys
are
hilarious
she
said
this
is
really
good
exciting
nerdy
stuff
the
gears
on
the
mechanical
computer
were
really
sharp
and
precise
they
looked
like
you
could
cut
yourself
on
them
when
they
ground
over
the
polished
surfaces
of
the
they
made
a
sound
like
a
box
of
toothpicks
falling
to
the
floor
clickclickclick
click
she
turned
the
crank
until
twelve
more
brown
m
ms
fell
out
who
the
van
halen
fan
lester
beamed
might
as
well
jump
jump
he
mimed
and
thrashed
his
shorn
head
up
and
down
as
though
he
were
headbanging
with
a
mighty
mane
of
locks
you
the
first
one
to
get
the
joke
he
said
even
perry
did
get
it
get
what
perry
said
also
grinning
van
halen
had
this
thing
where
if
there
were
any
brown
m
ms
in
their
dressing
room
they
trash
it
and
refuse
to
play
when
i
was
a
kid
i
used
to
about
being
so
famous
that
i
could
act
like
that
much
of
a
prick
ever
since
i
afforded
a
great
personal
significance
to
brown
m
ms
she
laughed
again
then
she
frowned
a
little
look
i
hate
to
break
this
party
up
but
i
came
here
because
kettlebelly
crap
said
that
you
guys
exemplified
everything
that
he
wanted
to
do
with
kodacell
this
stuff
you
done
is
all
very
interesting
it
killer
art
but
i
do
see
the
so
can
you
help
me
out
here
that
step
three
perry
said
he
led
her
back
to
his
workspace
to
a
platform
surrounded
by
articulated
arms
terminated
in
webcams
like
a
grocery
scale
in
the
embrace
of
a
metal
spider
scanner
he
said
producing
a
barbie
head
from
lester
machine
and
dropping
it
on
the
scales
he
prodded
a
button
and
a
nearby
screen
filled
with
a
model
of
the
head
flattened
on
the
side
where
it
touched
the
surface
he
turned
the
head
over
and
scanned
again
and
now
there
were
two
digital
versions
of
the
head
on
the
screen
he
moused
one
over
the
other
until
they
lined
up
a
menu
selected
an
option
and
then
they
were
merged
rotating
once
we
got
the
scan
it
basically
plasticine
he
distorted
the
barbie
head
stretching
it
and
squeezing
it
with
the
mouse
so
we
can
take
a
real
object
and
make
this
kind
of
protean
out
of
it
or
drop
it
down
to
a
wireframe
and
skin
it
with
any
bitmap
like
this
more
fast
mousing
barbie
head
turned
into
a
gridded
mesh
fine
filaments
stretching
off
along
each
mussed
strand
of
plastic
hair
then
a
campbell
cream
of
mushroom
soup
label
wrapped
around
her
like
a
stocking
being
pulled
over
her
head
there
was
something
stupendously
weird
and
simultaneously
very
comic
about
the
sight
the
kind
of
inherent
comedy
in
a
cartoon
stretched
out
on
a
blob
of
silly
putty
so
we
can
build
anything
out
of
interesting
junk
with
any
shape
and
then
we
can
digitize
the
shape
then
we
can
do
anything
we
like
with
the
shape
then
we
can
output
the
shape
he
typed
quickly
and
another
machine
sealed
and
mammoth
like
an
outsized
photocopier
started
to
grunt
and
churn
the
air
filled
with
a
smell
like
saran
wrap
in
a
microwave
the
goop
we
use
in
this
thing
is
you
would
want
to
build
a
car
out
of
it
but
it
makes
a
mean
the
last
stage
of
the
output
switches
to
inks
so
you
get
whatever
bitmap
skinned
your
object
with
baked
right
in
it
does
about
one
cubic
inch
per
minute
so
this
job
should
be
almost
done
now
he
drummed
his
fingers
on
top
of
the
machine
for
a
moment
and
then
it
stopped
chunking
and
something
inside
it
went
he
lifted
a
lid
and
reached
inside
and
plucked
out
the
barbie
head
stretched
and
distorted
skinned
with
a
campbell
soup
label
he
handed
it
to
suzanne
she
expected
it
to
be
warm
like
a
squashed
penny
from
a
machine
on
fisherman
wharf
but
it
was
cool
and
had
the
seamless
texture
of
a
plastic
margarine
tub
and
the
heft
of
a
paperweight
so
that
the
business
lester
said
or
so
we
told
we
been
making
cool
stuff
and
selling
it
to
collectors
on
the
web
for
you
know
gigantic
bucks
we
move
one
or
two
pieces
a
month
at
about
ten
grand
per
but
kettlebelly
says
he
going
to
industrialize
us
alienate
us
from
the
product
of
our
labor
and
turn
us
into
an
assembly
line
he
did
say
any
such
thing
perry
said
suzanne
was
aware
that
her
ears
had
grown
points
perry
gave
lester
an
affectionate
slug
in
the
shoulder
lester
only
kidding
what
we
need
is
a
couple
of
dogsbodies
and
some
bigger
printers
and
we
be
able
to
turn
out
more
modest
devices
by
the
hundred
or
possibly
the
thousand
we
can
tweak
the
designs
really
easily
because
nothing
is
coming
off
a
mold
so
there
no
setup
charge
so
we
can
do
limited
runs
of
a
hundred
redesign
do
another
hundred
we
can
make
to
and
we
need
an
mba
lester
said
kodacell
sending
us
a
business
manager
to
help
us
turn
junk
into
pesos
yeah
perry
said
with
a
worried
flick
of
his
eyes
yeah
a
business
manager
so
i
known
some
business
geeks
who
are
total
assholes
lester
said
who
care
about
what
they
doing
and
the
people
they
doing
it
with
respectful
and
mindful
it
like
lawyers
they
not
all
scumbags
some
of
them
are
totally
awesome
and
save
your
ass
suzanne
took
all
this
in
jotting
notes
on
an
notebook
when
he
arriving
next
week
lester
said
we
cleared
him
a
space
to
work
and
everything
he
someone
that
kettlewell
people
recruited
up
in
ithaca
and
he
going
to
move
here
to
work
with
us
sight
unseen
crazy
huh
crazy
suzanne
agreed
right
perry
said
that
next
week
and
this
aft
we
got
some
work
to
do
but
now
i
ready
for
lunch
you
guys
ready
for
lunch
something
about
food
and
really
fat
guys
it
seemed
like
an
awkward
question
to
suzanne
like
asking
someone
who
been
horribly
disfigured
by
burns
if
he
wanted
to
toast
a
marshmallow
but
lester
did
react
to
the
question
of
course
not
he
had
to
eat
everyone
had
to
eat
yeah
let
do
the
ihop
lester
trundled
back
to
his
half
of
the
workspace
then
came
back
with
a
cane
in
one
hand
there
like
three
places
to
eat
within
walking
distance
of
here
if
you
do
count
the
mobile
mexican
burrito
wagon
which
i
do
since
it
a
rolling
advertisement
for
dysentery
the
ihop
is
the
least
objectionable
of
those
we
could
drive
somewhere
suzanne
said
it
was
coming
up
on
noon
and
the
heat
once
they
got
outside
into
the
mall
ruins
was
like
the
steam
off
a
dishwasher
she
plucked
at
her
blouse
a
couple
of
times
it
the
only
chance
to
exercise
we
get
perry
said
it
pretty
much
impossible
to
live
or
work
within
walking
distance
of
anything
down
here
you
end
up
living
in
your
car
and
so
they
hiked
along
the
side
of
the
road
the
sidewalk
was
a
curious
mix
of
old
and
new
the
concrete
unworn
but
still
overgrown
by
tall
sawgrass
thriving
in
the
florida
heat
it
brushed
up
against
her
ankles
hard
and
sharp
unlike
the
grass
back
home
they
were
walking
parallel
to
a
ditch
filled
with
sluggish
brackish
water
and
populated
by
singing
frogs
ducks
ibises
and
mosquitoes
in
great
number
across
the
way
were
empty
lots
dead
filling
stations
behind
one
of
the
filling
stations
a
cluster
of
tents
and
shacks
squatters
she
asked
pointing
to
the
shantytown
yeah
perry
said
lots
of
that
down
here
some
of
them
are
the
paramilitary
wing
of
the
aarp
old
retirees
who
run
out
of
money
and
just
set
up
camp
here
some
are
bums
and
junkies
some
are
runaways
it
not
as
bad
as
it
looks
they
pretty
comfy
in
there
we
bring
furniture
and
other
good
pickings
that
show
up
at
the
junkyard
the
homeless
with
the
wherewithal
to
build
shantytowns
they
have
gone
all
animal
like
the
shopping
cart
people
and
the
scary
beachcombers
he
waved
across
the
malarial
ditch
to
an
old
man
in
a
pair
of
pressed
khaki
shorts
and
a
crisp
bermuda
shirt
hey
francis
he
called
the
old
man
waved
back
we
have
some
ihop
for
you
an
hour
the
old
man
ticked
a
salute
off
his
creased
forehead
francis
is
a
good
guy
used
to
be
an
aerospace
engineer
if
you
can
believe
it
wife
had
medical
problems
and
he
went
bust
taking
care
of
her
when
she
died
he
ended
up
here
in
his
and
never
left
kind
of
the
unofficial
mayor
of
this
little
patch
suzanne
stared
after
francis
he
had
a
bit
of
a
gimpy
leg
a
limp
she
could
spot
even
from
here
beside
her
lester
was
puffing
no
one
was
comfortable
walking
in
florida
it
seemed
it
took
another
half
hour
to
reach
the
ihop
the
international
house
of
pancakes
which
sat
opposite
a
with
only
one
store
a
place
that
advertised
which
struck
suzanne
as
profoundly
depressing
there
was
a
junkie
out
front
of
tees
a
woman
with
a
leathery
tan
and
a
tiny
and
shorts
that
made
her
look
a
little
like
a
tenderloin
hooker
but
not
with
that
hair
not
even
in
the
she
wobbled
uncertainly
across
the
parking
lot
to
them
excuse
me
she
said
with
an
improbable
valley
girl
accent
excuse
me
i
hoping
to
get
something
to
eat
it
for
my
kid
nursing
got
ta
keep
my
strength
up
her
naked
arms
and
legs
were
badly
tracked
out
and
suzanne
had
a
horrified
realization
that
among
the
stains
on
her
were
a
pair
of
spreading
pools
of
breast
milk
dampening
old
white
crusted
patches
over
her
sagging
breasts
for
my
baby
a
dollar
would
help
a
dollar
there
were
homeless
like
this
in
san
francisco
too
in
san
jose
as
well
she
supposed
but
she
did
know
where
they
hid
but
something
about
this
woman
cracked
out
and
tracked
out
it
freaked
her
out
she
dug
into
her
purse
and
got
out
a
five
dollar
bill
and
handed
it
to
the
homeless
woman
the
woman
smiled
a
snaggletoothed
stumpy
grin
and
reached
for
it
then
abruptly
grabbed
hold
of
suzanne
wrist
her
grip
was
damp
and
weak
do
you
fucking
look
at
me
like
that
you
not
better
than
me
bitch
suzanne
tugged
free
and
stepped
back
quickly
that
right
run
away
bitch
fuck
you
enjoy
your
lunch
she
was
shaking
perry
and
lester
closed
ranks
around
her
lester
moved
to
confront
the
homeless
woman
the
fuck

want
lard
ass
you
wan
na
fuck
with
me
i
got
a
knife
you
know

your
ears

lester
cocked
his
head
like
the
rca
victor
dog
he
towered
over
the
skinny
junkie
and
was
five
or
six
times
wider
than
her
you
all
right
he
said
gently
oh

just
fine
she
said
why

looking
for
a
party
he
laughed
you
joking
i
crush
you
she
laughed
too
a
less
crazy
more
relaxed
sound
lester
voice
was
a
low
soothing
rumble
i
do
think

friend
thinks
she
any
better
than
you
i
think
she
just
wanted
to

her
eyes
back
and
forth

out
you
got
a
shady
place

could
eat

nursing
hungry
work
the
junkie
cocked
her
head
then
she
laughed
yeah

sure
thanks
thanks
a
lot
lester
motioned
her
over
to
the
menu
in
the
ihop
window
and
waited
with
her
while
she
picked
out
a
helping
of
waffles
sausage
links
fried
eggs
hash
browns
coffee
orange
juice
and
a
chocolate
malted
is
that
all
he
said
laughing
laughing
both
of
them
laughing
all
of
them
laughing
at
the
incredible
outrageous
meal
they
went
in
and
waited
by
the
podium
the
greeter
a
black
guy
with
nodded
at
lester
and
perry
like
an
old
friend
hey
tony
lester
said

us
a
with
some
for
the
lady
outside
before
we
sit
down
he
recited
the
astounding
order
tony
shook
his
head
and
ducked
it
ok
be
right
up
he
said
you
want
to
sit
while
you
waiting
we
wait
here

lester
said

her
to
think
bailing
on
her
he
turned
and
waved
at
her
she
mean
you
know
be
careful
thanks
tony
lester
said
suzanne
marveled
at
lester
equanimity
nothing
got
his
goat
the
doggie
bag
arrived
i
put
some
extra
napkins
and
a
couple
of
in
there
tony
said
handing
it
to
him
great
lester
said
you
guys
sit
down
i
be
back
in
a
second
perry
motioned
for
suzanne
to
follow
him
to
a
booth
he
laughed
lester
a
good
guy
he
said
the
best
guy
i
know
you
know
how
do
you
know
him
she
asked
taking
out
her
notepad
he
was
the
sysadmin
at
a
company
that
was
making
printers
and
i
was
a
tech
at
a
company
that
was
buying
them
and
the
products
did
work
and
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
the
phone
with
him
troubleshooting
them
we
get
together
in
our
and
hack
around
with
neat
little
workbench
projects
stuff
we
come
up
with
at
work
when
both
companies
went
under
we
got
a
bunch
of
their
equipment
at
bankruptcy
auctions
lester
uncle
owned
the
junkyard
and
he
offered
us
space
to
set
up
our
workshops
and
the
rest
is
history
lester
joined
them
again
he
was
laughing
she
is
he
said
kept
hefting
the
sack
and
saying
what
those
bastards
put
on
a
plate
no
wonder
this
country
so
goddamned
fat
perry
laughed
too
suzanne
chuckled
nervously
and
looked
away
he
slid
into
the
booth
next
to
her
and
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
it
ok
i
a
guy
who
weighs
nearly
pounds
i
know
a
big
fat
guy
if
i
was
sensitive
about
it
i
could
last
ten
minutes
i
not
proud
of
being
as
big
as
i
am
but
i
not
ashamed
either
i
ok
with
it
you
would
lose
weight
if
you
could
sure
why
not
but
i
concluded
it
not
an
option
anymore
i
was
always
a
fat
kid
and
so
i
never
got
good
at
sports
never
got
that
habit
now
i
got
this
huge
deficit
when
i
sit
down
to
exercise
because
i
lugging
around
all
this
lard
ca
run
more
than
a
few
steps
walking
about
it
could
join
a
game
of
baseball
or
get
out
on
the
tennis
court
i
never
learned
to
cook
either
though
i
suppose
i
could
but
mostly
i
eat
out
and
i
try
to
order
sensibly
but
just
look
at
the
crap
they
feed
us
at
the
places
we
can
get
to
there
are
any
health
food
restaurants
in
the
strip
malls
look
at
this
menu
he
said
tapping
a
pornographic
glossy
picture
of
a
stack
of
glistening
waffles
oozing
with
some
kind
of
lube
caramel
pancakes
with
whipped
cream
maple
syrup
and
canned
strawberries
when
i
was
a
kid
we
called
that
these
people
will
sell
you
an
eight
dollar
ounce
plate
of
candy
with
a
side
of
sausage
eggs
biscuits
bacon
and
a
pint
of
orange
juice
even
if
you
order
this
stuff
and
eat
a
third
of
it
a
quarter
of
it
probably
too
much
and
when
you
got
a
lot
of
food
in
front
of
you
it
pretty
hard
to
know
when
to
stop
sure
the
thing
is
when
three
quarters
of
america
are
obese
when
half
are
dangerously
obese
like
me
years
off
our
lives
from
all
the
fat
that
tells
you
that
this
is
a
problem
we
did
get
less
willful
in
the
last
fifty
years
might
as
well
say
that
all
those
people
who
died
of
the
plague
lacked
the
to
keep
their
houses
free
of
rats
fat
is
moral
it
there
are
a
small
number
of
people
a
tiny
minority
whose
genes
are
in
a
way
that
makes
them
less
prone
to
retaining
nutrients
that
a
maladaptive
trait
through
most
of
human
history
burning
unnecessary
calories
when
you
got
to
chase
down
an
antelope
to
get
more
that
no
way
to
live
long
enough
to
pass
on
your
genes
so
you
and
perry
over
here
with
your
little
skinny
selves
able
to
pack
away
transfats
and
and
a
pound
of
candy
for
breakfast
at
the
ihop
you
not
doing
this
on
you
doing
it
by
expressing
the
somatotype
of
a
recessive
gene
would
i
like
to
be
thinner
sure
but
i
not
gon
na
let
the
fact
that
i
genetically
better
suited
to
famine
than
feast
get
to
me
speaking
of
let
eat
tony
buddy
i
want
a
plate
of
candy
he
was
smiling
and
brave
and
at
that
moment
suzanne
thought
that
she
could
get
a
crush
on
this
guy
this
big
smart
talented
funny
lovable
guy
then
reality
snapped
back
and
she
saw
him
as
he
was
sexless
lumpy
almost
grotesque
the
overlay
of
his
what
his
on
that
exterior
it
disoriented
her
she
looked
back
over
her
notes
so
you
say
that
there
a
third
coming
out
to
work
with
you
to
with
us
perry
said
that
part
of
the
deal
geek
houses
like
in
the
old
college
days
we
going
to
be
a
two
geeks
and
a
suit
lean
and
mean
the
suit
name
is
tjan
and
singaporean
by
way
of
london
by
way
of
ithaca
where
kettlebelly
found
him
we
talked
on
the
phone
a
couple
times
and
he
moving
down
next
week
he
moving
down
without
ever
having
met
you
yeah
that
the
way
it
goes
it
like
the
army
or
something
for
us
once
you
in
you
get
dispatched
here
or
there
it
was
in
the
contract
we
already
had
a
place
down
here
with
room
for
tjan
so
we
put
some
fresh
linen
on
the
and
laid
in
an
extra
toothbrush
it
a
little
lester
said
perry
and
i
get
along
great
but
i
have
had
such
good
luck
with
it
not
that
i
some
kind
of
idealist
who
does
get
the
need
to
make
money
but
they
can
be
so
condescending
you
know
suzanne
nodded
that
a
street
you
know
do
like
being
talked
down
to
by
engineers
lester
raised
a
hand
guilty
as
charged
so
what
you
planning
to
do
for
the
rest
of
the
week
it
was
wednesday
and
she
counted
on
getting
this
part
of
the
story
by
saturday
but
here
she
was
going
to
have
to
wait
clearly
until
this
tjan
arrived
same
stuff
as
we
always
do
we
build
crazy
stuff
out
of
junk
sell
it
to
collectors
and
have
fun
we
could
go
to
the
thunderbird
drive
in
tonight
if
you
want
it
a
real
classic
by
day
and
drive
in
by
night
practically
the
last
one
standing
perry
cut
in
or
we
could
go
to
south
beach
and
get
a
good
meal
if
that
more
your
speed
naw
suzanne
said
drive
in
sounds
great
especially
if
it
such
a
dying
breed
better
get
a
visit
in
while
there
still
time
they
tried
to
treat
her
but
she
would
let
them
she
never
let
anyone
buy
her
so
much
as
a
cup
of
coffee
it
was
an
old
drill
and
she
was
practically
the
only
scribbler
she
knew
who
hewed
to
it
some
of
the
whores
on
the
silicon
valley
papers
took
in
free
computers
trips
even
spa
days
but
she
had
never
wavered
the
afternoon
passed
quickly
and
enchantingly
perry
was
working
on
a
articulated
frankenstein
monster
built
out
of
seashells
from
a
kitsch
market
they
said
god
bless
america
and
souvenir
of
florida
and
conch
republic
and
each
had
to
be
fitted
out
for
a
motor
custom
built
to
conform
to
its
contours
when
it
done
it
will
make
toast
make
toast
yeah
separate
a
single
slice
off
a
loaf
load
it
into
a
depress
the
lever
time
the
retrieve
the
toast
and
butter
it
i
got
the
idea
from
loaders
this
plus
a
toaster
will
function
as
a
loosely
coupled
single
system
ok
that
really
cool
but
i
have
to
ask
the
boring
question
perry
why
why
build
a
perry
stopped
working
and
dusted
his
hands
off
he
was
really
built
and
his
shaggy
hair
made
him
look
younger
than
his
suggested
he
turned
a
seashell
with
a
motor
in
it
over
and
spun
it
like
a
top
on
the
weather
is
you
were
beautiful
legend
well
that
the
question
is
it
the
simple
answer
people
buy
them
collectors
so
it
a
good
hobby
business
but
that
not
really
it
it
like
this
engineering
is
all
about
constraint
given
a
span
of
foo
feet
and
materials
of
tensile
strength
of
bar
build
a
bridge
that
does
go
all
fubared
write
a
fun
for
an
console
that
fit
in
build
the
fastest
airplane
or
the
one
with
the
largest
carrying
capacity
but
these
days
there
not
much
traditional
constraint
i
got
the
engineer
most
dangerous
luxury
plenty
all
the
computational
cycles
i
ever
need
easy
and
rapid
prototyping
precision
tools
now
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
suite
of
tasks
lurking
that
demand
all
this
resource
and
more
maybe
i
like
some
locomotive
engineer
declaring
that
miles
per
hour
is
the
pinnacle
of
machine
velocity
that
speed
is
cracked
but
i
do
see
many
of
those
problems
none
that
interest
me
what
i
got
here
are
my
own
constraints
i
challenging
myself
using
found
objects
and
making
stuff
that
throws
all
this
computational
capacity
at
you
know
these
problems
like
elmo
clusters
and
seashell
we
have
so
much
capacity
that
the
trivia
expands
to
fill
it
and
all
that
capacity
is
it
leftovers
there
enough
computational
capacity
in
a
junkyard
to
launch
a
and
that
by
design
remember
the
ipod
why
do
you
think
it
was
so
prone
to
scratching
and
going
all
gunky
after
a
year
in
your
pocket
why
would
apple
build
a
handheld
technology
out
of
materials
that
turned
to
shit
if
you
looked
at
them
it
because
the
ipod
was
only
meant
to
last
a
year
it
like
tailfins
they
were
cool
in
the
tailfin
cretaceous
but
would
it
have
been
better
if
they
could
have
disappeared
from
view
when
they
became
aesthetically
obsolete
when
the
space
age
withered
up
and
blew
away
oh
not
really
obviously
because
it
nice
to
see
a
on
the
highway
every
now
and
again
if
only
for
variety
sake
but
if
you
going
to
design
something
that
is
meant
to
be
then
presumably
you
should
have
some
planned
obsolescence
in
there
some
strategy
for
the
aesthetic
crash
that
follows
any
couture
movement
here
check
this
out
he
handed
her
a
white
brick
the
size
of
a
deck
of
cards
it
took
her
a
moment
to
recognize
it
as
an
ipod
christ
it
she
said
yeah
is
it
just
remember
how
small
and
shiny
this
thing
was
when
it
shipped
thousand
songs
in
your
pocket
that
made
her
actually
laugh
out
loud
she
fished
in
her
pocket
for
her
earbuds
and
dropped
them
on
the
table
where
they
clattered
like
m
ms
i
i
got
about
songs
on
those
have
run
out
of
space
yet
either
he
rolled
the
buds
around
in
his
palm
like
a
pair
of
dice
you
i
stopped
keeping
track
of
mine
after
i
added
my
audiobook
i
got
a
bunch
of
the
library
of
congress
in
mine
as
scans
too
a
copy
of
the
internet
archive
every
post
ever
made
on
usenet
basically
these
things
are
infinitely
capacious
given
the
size
of
the
media
we
work
with
today
he
rolled
the
buds
out
on
the
workbench
and
laughed
and
that
just
the
point
tomorrow
we
have
some
new
extra
fat
kind
of
media
and
some
new
task
to
perform
with
it
and
some
new
storage
medium
that
will
make
these
things
look
like
an
old
ipod
before
that
happens
you
want
this
to
wear
out
and
scuff
up
or
get
lost
i
lose
those
things
all
the
time
like
a
set
a
month
there
you
go
then
the
ipods
were
too
big
to
lose
like
that
but
just
at
the
ipod
chrome
was
scratched
to
the
point
of
being
fogged
like
the
mirror
in
a
toilet
the
screen
was
almost
unreadable
for
all
the
scratches
they
had
materials
and
hard
plastics
back
then
they
to
build
these
things
out
of
saran
wrap
and
so
that
by
the
time
they
doubled
in
capacity
next
year
you
have
already
worn
yours
out
and
would
feel
bad
about
junking
them
so
i
building
a
seashell
robot
toaster
out
of
discarded
obsolete
technology
because
the
world
is
full
of
capacious
capable
disposable
junk
and
it
cries
out
to
be
used
again
it
a
potlatch
i
have
so
much
material
and
computational
wealth
that
i
can
afford
to
waste
it
on
frivolous
junk
i
think
that
why
the
collectors
buy
it
anyway
that
brings
us
back
to
the
question
of
your
relationship
with
kodacell
they
want
to
do
what
exactly
with
you
well
we
been
playing
with
some
techniques
the
printer
and
so
on
when
kettlebelly
called
me
he
said
that
he
wanted
to
see
about
using
the
scanner
and
so
on
to
make
a
lot
of
these
things
at
a
low
it
pretty
perverse
when
you
think
about
it
using
modern
technology
to
build
replicas
of
obsolete
technology
rescued
from
the
dump
when
these
replicas
are
bound
to
end
up
back
here
at
the
dump
he
laughed
he
had
nice
around
his
eyes
anyway
it
something
that
lester
and
i
had
talked
about
for
a
long
time
but
never
really
got
around
to
too
much
like
retail
it
bad
enough
dealing
with
a
couple
dozen
collectors
pay
ten
grand
for
a
sculpture
who
wants
to
deal
with
ten
thousand
customers
who
go
a
dollar
each
for
the
same
thing
but
you
figure
that
this
tjan
character
will
handle
all
the
customer
stuff
that
the
idea
he
run
the
business
side
we
get
more
time
to
hack
everyone
gets
paid
kodacell
got
some
marketing
agencies
specialized
pr
firms
creative
shippers
all
kinds
of
little
outfits
that
they
promised
to
hook
us
up
with
tjan
interfaces
with
them
we
do
our
thing
enrich
the
shareholders
get
stock
ourselves
it
supposed
to
be
all
upside
hell
if
it
work
we
can
just
walk
away
and
find
another
dump
and
go
back
into
the
collectors
market
he
picked
up
his
shell
and
swung
a
lamp
with
a
magnifying
lens
built
into
it
over
his
workspace
hey
just
a
sec
ok
i
just
figured
out
what
i
was
doing
wrong
before
he
took
up
a
little
tweezers
and
a
plastic
rod
and
probed
for
a
moment
then
daubed
some
solder
down
inside
the
shell
guts
he
tweezed
a
wire
to
a
contact
and
the
shell
made
a
motorized
sound
a
peg
sticking
out
of
it
began
to
move
rhythmically
got
it
he
said
he
set
it
down
i
do
expect
i
going
to
be
doing
many
more
of
these
projects
after
next
week
this
kind
of
design
we
could
never
it
he
looked
a
little
wistful
and
suzanne
suppressed
a
smile
what
a
tortured
artiste
this
florida
junkyard
engineer
was
as
the
long
day
drew
to
a
close
they
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
twilight
cool
in
the
yard
the
sopping
humidity
of
the
day
settled
around
them
as
the
sun
set
in
a
long
summer
blaze
that
turned
the
dry
fountain
full
of
christmas
ornaments
into
a
luminescent
bowl
of
jewels
i
got
some
real
progress
today
lester
said
he
had
a
cane
with
him
and
he
was
limping
heavily
got
the
printer
to
output
complete
mechanical
logical
gates
all
in
one
piece
almost
no
assembly
just
them
on
a
board
and
i
been
working
on
a
standard
system
for
each
gate
to
the
next
it
going
to
make
it
a
lot
easier
to
ramp
up
production
yeah
perry
said
he
asked
a
technical
question
about
the
printer
something
about
the
goop
tensile
strength
that
suzanne
follow
they
went
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
talking
through
the
abstruse
details
faster
than
she
could
follow
walking
more
and
more
quickly
past
the
vast
heaps
of
dead
technology
and
mall
stores
she
let
them
get
ahead
of
her
and
stopped
to
gather
her
thoughts
she
turned
around
to
take
it
all
in
and
that
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
kids
sneaking
into
perry
and
lester
lab
hey
she
shouted
in
her
loudest
detroit
voice
what
are
you
doing
there
there
were
three
of
them
in
miami
dolphins
jerseys
and
shiny
heads
and
little
shorts
the
latest
inexplicable
rapper
style
which
made
them
look
more
like
drag
queens
in
mufti
than
they
rounded
on
her
they
were
heavyset
and
their
eyebrows
were
bleached
blond
they
had
been
sneaking
into
the
lab
looking
about
as
inconspicuous
as
a
trio
of
nuns
get
lost
she
shouted
get
out
of
here
perry
lester
they
were
coming
closer
now
they
did
move
so
well
puffing
in
the
heat
but
they
clearly
had
mayhem
on
their
minds
she
reached
into
her
purse
for
her
pepper
spray
and
held
it
before
her
dramatically
but
they
did
stop
coming
suddenly
the
air
was
rent
by
the
loudest
sound
she
ever
heard
like
she
put
her
head
inside
a
foghorn
she
flinched
and
misted
a
cloud
of
aerosol
capsicum
ahead
of
her
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
step
back
quickly
before
catching
a
blowback
but
she
was
quick
enough
for
her
eyes
and
nose
started
to
burn
and
water
the
sound
stop
it
just
kept
going
on
a
sound
like
her
head
was
too
small
to
contain
her
brain
a
sound
that
made
her
teeth
ache
the
three
kids
had
stopped
and
staggered
off
you
ok
the
voice
sounded
like
it
was
coming
from
far
far
away
though
lester
was
right
in
front
of
her
she
found
that
she
dropped
to
her
knees
in
the
teeth
of
that
astonishing
noise
she
let
him
help
her
to
her
feet
jesus
she
said
putting
a
hand
to
her
ears
they
rang
like
she
been
at
a
rave
all
night
what
the
hell
sonic
device
lester
said
she
realized
that
he
was
shouting
but
she
could
barely
hear
it
it
does
do
any
permanent
damage
but
it
scare
off
most
anyone
those
kids
probably
live
in
the
shantytown
we
passed
this
morning
more
and
more
of
them
are
joining
gangs
they
our
neighbors
so
we
do
want
to
shoot
them
or
anything
she
nodded
the
ringing
in
her
ears
was
subsiding
a
little
lester
steadied
her
she
leaned
on
him
he
was
big
and
solid
he
wore
the
same
cologne
as
her
father
had
she
realized
she
moved
away
from
him
and
smoothed
out
her
shorts
dusting
off
her
knees
did
you
invent
that
made
it
using
a
howto
i
found
online
he
said
lot
of
kids
around
here
up
to
no
good
it
pretty
much
a
homebrew
civil
defense
siren
rugged
and
cheap
she
put
a
finger
in
each
ear
and
scratched
at
the
itchy
buzzing
when
she
removed
them
her
hearing
was
almost
back
to
normal
i
once
had
an
upstairs
neighbor
in
cambridge
who
had
a
stereo
system
that
loud
never
thought
i
hear
it
again
perry
came
and
joined
them
i
followed
them
a
bit
they
way
gone
now
i
think
i
recognized
one
of
them
from
the
campsite
i
talk
to
francis
about
it
and
see
if
he
can
set
them
right
have
you
been
broken
into
before
a
few
times
mostly
what
we
worry
about
is
someone
trashing
the
printers
everything
else
is
easy
to
replace
but
when
lester
old
employer
went
bust
we
bought
up
about
fifty
of
these
things
at
the
auction
and
i
do
know
where
we
lay
hands
on
them
again
computers
are
cheap
and
it
not
like
anyone
could
really
all
this
junk
he
flashed
her
his
confident
smile
again
what
time
do
the
movies
start
lester
checked
his
watch
about
an
hour
after
sunset
if
we
leave
now
we
can
get
a
real
dinner
at
a
haitian
place
i
know
and
then
head
over
to
the
thunderbird
i
hide
under
a
blanket
in
the
back
seat
so
that
we
can
save
on
admission
she
done
that
many
times
as
a
kid
her
father
shushing
her
and
her
brother
as
they
giggled
beneath
the
blankets
the
thought
of
giant
lester
doing
it
made
her
chuckle
i
think
we
can
afford
to
pay
for
you
she
said
the
dinner
was
good
fiery
spicy
fish
and
good
music
in
an
old
tiki
bar
with
peeling
grass
wallpaper
that
managed
to
look
vaguely
haitian
the
waiters
spoke
spanish
not
french
though
she
let
herself
be
talked
into
two
bottles
of
beer
about
one
and
a
half
more
than
she
would
normally
take
but
she
did
get
the
heat
and
humidity
seemed
to
rinse
the
alcohol
right
out
of
her
bloodstream
they
got
to
the
movies
just
at
dusk
it
was
just
like
she
remembered
from
being
a
little
girl
and
coming
with
her
parents
children
in
pajamas
climbed
over
a
to
one
side
of
the
lot
ranked
rows
of
cars
faced
the
huge
grubby
white
projection
walls
they
even
showed
one
of
those
scratchy
old
let
all
go
to
the
lobby
and
get
ourselves
a
treat
cartoon
shorts
with
the
dancing
before
the
movie
the
nostalgia
filled
her
up
like
a
balloon
expanding
in
her
chest
she
had
ever
seen
a
computer
until
she
was
ten
years
old
and
that
had
been
the
size
of
a
with
less
capability
than
one
of
the
active
cards
that
came
in
glossy
fashion
magazines
with
for
perfume
and
the
world
had
been
stood
on
its
head
so
many
times
in
the
intervening
years
that
it
was
literally
dizzying
or
was
that
the
beer
having
a
delayed
effect
suddenly
all
the
certainties
she
rested
on
her
her
house
her
ability
to
navigate
the
professional
world
in
a
competent
manner
seemed
to
be
built
on
shifting
sands
they
come
in
lester
car
a
homemade
auto
built
around
two
electric
smart
cars
joined
together
to
form
a
kind
of
with
room
enough
for
lester
to
slide
into
the
driver
perch
with
room
to
spare
once
they
arrived
they
unpacked
clever
folding
chairs
and
sat
them
beside
the
car
rolled
down
the
windows
and
turned
up
the
speakers
it
was
a
warm
night
but
not
sticky
the
way
it
had
been
that
day
and
the
kiss
of
the
wind
that
rustled
the
leaves
of
the
tall
palms
ringing
the
theater
was
like
balm
the
movie
was
something
forgettable
about
bumbling
detectives
on
the
moon
one
of
those
trendy
new
things
acted
entirely
by
animated
dead
actors
who
combined
the
virtues
of
draw
and
cheap
labor
there
might
have
been
a
couple
of
fictional
actors
in
there
too
it
was
hard
to
say
she
never
really
followed
the
movies
except
as
a
place
to
escape
to
there
was
real
magic
and
escape
in
a
though
with
the
palpable
evidence
of
all
those
other
breathing
humans
in
the
darkened
night
watching
the
magic
story
flicker
past
on
the
screen
something
that
went
right
into
her
hindbrain
before
she
knew
it
her
eyelids
were
drooping
and
then
she
found
herself
jerking
awake
this
happened
a
couple
times
before
lester
slipped
a
pillow
under
her
head
and
she
sank
into
it
and
fell
into
sleep
she
woke
at
the
closing
credits
and
realized
that
she
managed
to
prop
the
pillow
on
lester
she
snapped
her
head
up
and
then
smiled
embarrassedly
at
him
hey
sleepyhead
he
said
you
snore
like
a
bandsaw
you
know
it
she
blushed
i
do
you
do
he
said
i
do
perry
on
her
other
side
nodded
you
do
god
she
said
do
worry
you
have
got
anything
on
lester
perry
said
gone
into
his
room
some
mornings
and
found
all
the
pictures
lying
on
the
floor
vibrated
off
their
hooks
it
seemed
to
her
that
lester
was
blushing
now
i
sorry
if
i
spoiled
the
movie
she
said
do
sweat
it
lester
said
clearly
grateful
for
the
change
of
subject
it
was
a
lousy
movie
anyway
you
drowned
out
some
truly
foul
dialogue
well
there
that
let
go
back
to
the
office
and
get
you
your
car
it
an
hour
to
miami
from
here
she
was
wide
awake
by
the
time
she
parked
the
in
the
parking
lot
and
crawled
into
her
room
slapping
the
buttons
up
to
full
to
clear
out
the
stifling
air
that
had
baked
into
the
interior
during
the
day
she
lay
on
her
back
in
the
dark
coffin
for
a
long
time
eyes
open
and
slowly
adjusting
to
the
idiot
lights
on
the
control
panel
until
it
seemed
that
she
was
lying
in
a
space
capsule
hurtling
through
the
universe
at
relativistic
speeds
leaving
behind
history
the
world
everything
she
knew
she
sat
up
wide
awake
on
west
coast
time
suddenly
and
there
was
no
way
she
would
fall
asleep
now
but
she
lay
back
down
and
then
she
did
finally
the
alarm
woke
her
seemingly
five
minutes
later
she
did
a
couple
laps
around
the
parking
lot
padding
around
stretching
her
legs
trying
to
clear
her
head
her
internal
clock
thought
that
it
was
but
at
on
the
east
coast
the
sun
was
up
and
the
heat
had
begun
to
sizzle
all
the
available
moisture
into
the
air
she
left
the
hotel
and
drove
around
miami
for
a
while
she
needed
to
find
some
toiletries
and
then
a
cafe
where
she
could
sit
down
and
file
some
copy
she
tweeted
a
bunch
of
working
notes
and
posted
a
few
things
to
her
blog
the
day
before
but
her
editor
expected
something
more
coherent
for
those
who
preferred
their
news
a
little
more
digested
by
the
time
she
arrived
at
perry
junkyard
the
day
had
tipped
for
afternoon
the
sun
no
longer
straight
overhead
the
heat
a
little
softer
than
it
had
been
the
day
before
she
settled
in
for
another
day
of
watching
the
guys
work
asking
the
occasional
question
the
column
she
ended
up
filing
had
been
a
kind
of
piece
describing
the
cool
culture
these
two
had
going
between
them
and
asking
if
it
could
survive
scaling
up
to
mass
production
now
she
experimented
with
their
sculptures
and
machines
that
almost
worked
or
did
work
at
all
but
that
showed
the
scope
of
their
creativity
kettlewell
thought
that
there
were
a
thousand
ten
thousand
people
as
creative
as
these
two
out
there
waiting
to
be
discovered
could
it
be
true
sure
perry
said
why
not
we
just
here
because
someone
dropped
the
barrier
to
entry
made
it
possible
for
a
couple
of
tinkerers
to
get
a
lot
of
materials
and
to
assemble
them
without
knowing
a
whole
lot
about
advanced
materials
science
was
it
like
this
when
the
internet
was
starting
out
woah
suzanne
said
i
just
realized
that
you
would
really
remember
those
days
back
in
the
early
nineties
sure
i
remember
them
i
was
a
kid
but
i
remember
them
fine
she
felt
very
old
the
thing
was
that
no
one
really
suspected
that
there
were
so
many
liberal
arts
majors
lurking
in
the
universities
dying
to
drop
out
and
learn
perl
and
html
perry
cocked
his
head
yeah
i
guess
that
analogous
the
legacy
of
the
dotcom
years
for
me
is
all
this
free
infrastructure
very
cheap
network
connections
and
hosting
companies
and
so
on
that
i
guess
combined
with
people
willing
to
use
it
i
never
really
thought
of
it
but
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
people
hanging
around
in
the
old
days
who
thought
email
and
the
net
were
pretty
sketchy
right
she
waved
her
hands
at
him
perry
lad
you
do
know
the
half
of
it
there
are
executives
in
the
rustbelt
who
spend
bailout
money
on
secretaries
to
print
out
their
email
and
then
dictate
replies
into
tape
recorders
to
be
typed
and
sent
he
furrowed
his
thick
eyebrows
you
joking
he
said
she
put
her
hand
on
her
heart
i
kid
you
not
i
knew
people
in
the
newsroom
at
the
detroit
free
press
there
are
whole
industries
in
this
country
that
are
living
in
the
last
century
well
for
me
all
that
dotcommie
stuff
was
like
putting
down
a
good
base
making
it
easy
for
people
like
me
to
get
parts
and
and
to
find
hardware
hackers
to
jam
with
perry
got
engrossed
in
a
tricky
bit
of
then
and
she
wandered
over
to
lester
who
was
printing
out
more
barbie
heads
for
a
much
larger
version
of
his
mechanical
computer
it
be
able
to
add
subtract
and
multiply
any
two
numbers
up
to
he
said
it
took
decades
to
build
a
machine
that
could
do
that
much
doing
it
with
in
just
three
revs
in
your
face
univac
she
laughed
he
had
a
huge
bag
of
switches
that
he
was
soldering
onto
a
variety
of
substrates
from
polished
to
a
bamboo
she
looked
closely
at
the
solder
is
this
what
sweatshop
solder
looks
like
he
looked
confused
then
said
oh
right
perry
thing
yeah
anything
not
done
by
a
robot
has
this
artisanal
quality
of
blobbiness
which
i
quite
like
it
aesthetic
like
a
painting
with
visible
brushstrokes
but
perry
right
if
you
see
solder
like
this
on
anything
that
there
are
a
million
of
then
you
know
that
it
was
laid
down
by
kids
and
women
working
for
slave
wages
there
no
way
cheaper
to
make
a
million
solders
by
hand
than
by
robot
unless
your
labor
force
is
locked
in
amphetamine
and
destroyed
for
anything
except
prostitution
inside
of
five
years
but
here
in
something
like
this
so
handmade
and
one
of
a
kind
i
think
it
gives
it
a
nice
neoprimitive
feel
like
a
field
of
furrows
she
nodded
today
she
was
keeping
her
computer
out
writing
down
quotes
and
tweeting
thoughts
as
they
came
they
worked
side
by
side
in
companionable
silence
for
a
while
as
she
killed
a
couple
thousand
spams
and
he
laid
down
a
couple
dozen
blobs
of
solder
how
do
you
like
florida
he
said
after
straightening
up
and
cracking
his
back
she
barely
stopped
typing
deep
into
some
email
it
all
right
i
suppose
there
great
stuff
here
if
you
know
where
to
look
want
me
to
show
you
around
a
little
tonight
it
friday
after
all
sounds
good
is
perry
free
it
took
her
a
second
to
register
that
he
had
answered
she
looked
up
and
saw
he
was
blushing
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
i
thought
we
could
go
out
just
the
two
of
us
dinner
and
a
walk
around
the
deco
stuff
on
miami
beach
oh
she
said
and
the
weird
thing
was
she
took
it
seriously
for
a
second
she
had
been
on
a
date
in
something
like
a
year
and
he
was
a
really
nice
guy
and
so
forth
but
professional
ethics
made
that
impossible
and
besides
and
besides
he
was
huge
he
told
her
he
weighed
nearly
pounds
so
fat
he
was
essentially
sexless
round
and
unshaped
doughy
all
of
these
thoughts
in
an
instant
and
then
she
said
oh
well
listen
lester
it
about
professional
ethics
i
here
on
a
story
and
you
guys
are
really
swell
but
i
here
to
be
objective
that
means
no
dating
sorry
she
said
it
in
the
same
firm
tones
as
she
used
to
turn
down
their
offer
to
treat
her
at
the
ihop
a
fact
of
life
something
she
just
did
do
like
turning
down
a
glass
of
beer
by
saying
no
thanks
i
do
drink
no
value
judgment
but
she
could
see
that
she
had
let
her
thinking
show
on
her
face
if
only
for
the
briefest
moment
lester
stiffened
and
his
nostrils
flared
he
wiped
his
hands
on
his
thighs
then
said
in
a
light
tone
sure
no
problem
i
understand
completely
should
have
thought
of
that
sorry
no
problem
she
said
she
pretended
to
work
on
her
email
a
while
longer
then
said
well
i
think
i
call
it
a
day
see
you
monday
for
tjan
arrival
right
right
he
said
too
brightly
and
she
slunk
away
to
her
car
she
spent
the
weekend
blogging
and
seeing
the
beach
the
people
on
the
beach
seemed
to
be
of
another
species
from
the
ones
she
saw
walking
the
streets
of
hollywood
and
miami
and
lauderdale
they
had
freakishly
perfect
bodies
the
kind
of
thing
you
saw
in
an
anatomical
drawing
or
a
so
much
muscular
definition
that
they
were
practically
she
even
tried
out
the
nude
beach
intrigued
to
see
these
perfect
specimens
in
the
but
she
chickened
out
when
she
realized
that
she
need
a
substantial
before
her
body
hair
was
brought
down
to
norms
for
that
strip
of
sand
she
did
get
an
eyeful
of
several
anatomically
correct
drawings
before
taking
off
again
it
made
her
uncomfortably
horny
and
aware
of
how
long
it
had
been
since
her
last
date
that
got
her
thinking
of
poor
lester
buried
underneath
all
that
flesh
and
that
got
her
thinking
about
the
life
she
chosen
for
herself
covering
the
weird
world
of
tech
where
the
ground
never
stood
still
long
enough
for
her
to
get
her
balance
so
she
retreated
to
blog
in
a
cafe
posting
snippets
and
impressions
from
her
days
with
the
boys
along
with
photos
her
readers
were
all
over
it
commenting
like
mad
half
of
them
thought
it
was
disgusting
so
much
suffering
and
waste
in
the
world
and
these
guys
were
inventing
toys
out
of
garbage
the
other
half
wanted
to
know
where
to
go
to
buy
one
for
themselves
halfway
through
sunday
her
laptop
battery
finally
died
needing
a
fresh
weekly
charge
so
she
retreated
again
to
the
coffin
to
wait
for
monday
and
the
new
day
that
would
dawn
for
perry
and
lester
and
kodacell
and
her
tjan
turned
out
to
be
a
lot
older
than
she
expected
she
pictured
him
as
about
smart
and
preppie
like
they
all
were
when
they
were
fresh
out
of
and
full
of
management
wisdom
instead
he
was
about
forty
balding
with
a
little
and
thinning
hair
he
dressed
like
an
english
professor
and
a
checked
shirt
and
a
tweedy
that
he
shucked
within
seconds
of
leaving
the
terminal
at
miami
airport
and
stepping
into
the
heat
they
all
come
in
lester
big
crazy
car
and
squishing
back
in
with
tjan
suitcases
was
like
a
geometry
trick
she
found
herself
half
on
perry
lap
hugging
half
a
big
that
seemed
to
be
full
of
bricks
books
tjan
said
just
a
little
personal
library
it
a
bad
habit
moving
the
physical
objects
around
but
i
addicted
he
had
a
calm
voice
that
might
in
fact
be
a
little
dull
a
prof
monotone
they
brought
him
to
perry
and
lester
place
which
was
three
condos
with
the
dividing
walls
knocked
out
in
a
complex
that
had
long
down
its
sides
and
rickety
balconies
that
had
been
eaten
away
by
salt
air
there
was
a
guardhouse
at
the
front
of
the
complex
but
it
was
shuttered
abandoned
and
graffiti
tagged
tjan
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
put
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
considered
the
building
it
could
use
a
coat
of
paint
he
said
suzanne
looked
closely
at
him
he
was
so
deadpan
it
was
hard
to
tell
what
was
on
his
mind
but
he
slipped
her
a
wink
yeah
perry
said
it
could
at
that
on
the
bright
side
spacious
cheap
and
there
a
pool
there
a
lot
of
this
down
here
since
the
housing
market
crashed
the
condo
association
here
dissolved
about
four
years
ago
so
there
not
really
anyone
who
in
charge
of
all
the
common
spaces
and
stuff
just
a
few
condo
owners
and
speculators
who
own
the
apartments
suckers
i
thinking
our
rent
has
gone
down
twice
this
year
just
for
asking
i
thinking
we
could
probably
get
them
to
pay
us
to
live
here
and
just
keep
out
the
bums
and
stuff
the
living
quarters
were
nearly
indistinguishable
from
the
workshop
at
the
junkyard
strewn
with
cool
devices
in
various
stages
of
disassembly
detritus
and
art
the
plates
and
dishes
and
glasses
all
had
ihop
and
cracker
barrel
logos
on
them
from
thrift
shops
lester
explained
old
people
steal
them
when
they
get
their
earlybird
specials
and
then
when
they
die
their
kids
give
them
to
goodwill
cheapest
way
to
get
a
matched
set
around
here
tjan
circled
the
three
adjoined
condos
like
a
dog
circling
his
basket
finally
he
picked
an
unoccupied
master
bedroom
with
moldy
lace
curtains
and
a
painting
of
an
abstract
landscape
over
the
headboard
he
set
his
suitcase
down
on
the
chest
of
drawers
and
said
right
i
done
let
get
to
work
they
took
him
to
the
workshop
next
and
his
expression
hardly
changed
as
they
showed
him
around
showed
him
their
cabinets
of
wonders
when
they
were
done
he
let
them
walk
him
to
the
ihop
and
he
ordered
the
most
austere
thing
on
the
menu
a
and
jelly
sandwich
that
was
technically
on
the
kids
menu
a
kids
menu
at
a
place
where
the
grownups
could
order
a
plate
of
candy
so
perry
said
so
tjan
come
on
buddy
give
it
to
me
straight
you
hate
it
love
it
ca
understand
it
tjan
set
down
his
sandwich
you
boys
are
very
talented
he
said
they
very
good
inventions
there
are
lots
of
opportunities
for
synergy
within
kodacell
marketing
logistics
even
packing
materials
there
a
little
aerogel
startup
in
oregon
that
kodacell
is
underwriting
that
you
could
use
for
padding
when
you
ship
perry
and
lester
looked
at
him
expectantly
suzanne
broke
the
silence
tjan
did
you
have
any
artistic
or
design
ideas
about
the
things
that
these
guys
are
making
tjan
took
another
bite
of
sandwich
and
sipped
at
his
milk
well
you
have
to
come
up
with
a
name
for
them
something
that
identifies
them
also
i
think
you
should
be
careful
with
trademarked
objects
any
time
you
need
to
bring
in
an
ip
lawyer
you
going
to
run
into
huge
costs
and
time
delays
they
waited
again
that
it
perry
said
nothing
about
the
designs
themselves
i
the
that
editorial
i
artistically
autistic
not
my
job
to
help
you
design
things
it
my
job
to
sell
the
things
you
design
would
it
matter
what
it
was
we
were
making
would
you
feel
the
same
if
it
was
toothbrushes
or
staplers
tjan
smiled
if
you
were
making
staplers
i
would
be
here
because
there
no
profit
in
staplers
too
many
competitors
toothbrushes
are
a
possibility
if
you
were
making
something
really
revolutionary
people
buy
about
toothbrushes
a
year
so
lots
of
opportunity
to
come
up
with
an
innovative
design
that
sells
at
a
good
profit
over
marginal
cost
for
a
couple
seasons
before
it
gets
cloned
or
what
you
people
are
making
has
an
edge
because
it
you
making
it
very
bespoke
and
distinctive
i
think
it
will
take
some
time
for
the
world
to
emerge
an
effective
competitor
to
these
goods
provided
that
you
can
build
an
initial
marketplace
in
them
there
are
enough
people
out
there
who
know
how
to
combine
all
the
things
you
combined
here
the
system
makes
it
hard
to
sell
anything
above
the
marginal
cost
of
goods
unless
you
have
a
really
innovative
idea
which
ca
stay
innovative
for
long
so
you
need
continuous
invention
and
too
you
two
fellows
appear
to
be
doing
that
i
do
know
anything
definitive
about
the
aesthetic
qualities
of
your
gadgets
nor
how
useful
they
be
but
i
understand
their
distinctiveness
so
that
why
i
here
it
was
longer
than
all
the
speeches
he
delivered
since
arriving
put
together
suzanne
nodded
and
made
some
notes
perry
looked
him
up
and
down
you
what
an
prof
from
cornell
right
yes
for
a
few
years
and
i
ran
a
company
for
a
while
doing
from
emerging
economy
states
in
the
former
soviet
bloc
i
see
perry
said
so
you
into
what
a
new
company
every
months
or
something
oh
no
tjan
said
and
he
had
a
little
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
the
tiniest
hint
of
a
smile
oh
no
every
six
months
a
year
at
the
outside
that
my
deal
i
the
business
guy
with
the
short
attention
span
i
see
perry
said
kettlewell
did
mention
this
at
the
junkyard
tjan
wandered
around
the
smart
car
and
peered
at
its
innards
watched
the
elmos
negotiate
their
balance
and
position
with
minute
movements
and
acoustic
signals
i
would
worry
about
it
if
i
were
you
he
said
you
guys
are
temperamentally
suited
to
doing
just
one
thing
lester
laughed
he
got
you
there
dude
he
said
slapping
perry
on
the
shoulder
suzanne
got
tjan
out
for
dinner
that
night
my
dad
was
in
and
we
travelled
a
lot
all
over
asia
and
then
the
former
soviets
he
sent
me
away
when
i
was
to
finish
school
in
the
states
and
there
was
no
question
but
that
i
would
go
to
stanford
for
business
school
nice
to
meet
a
fellow
californian
she
said
and
sipped
her
wine
they
gone
to
one
of
the
famed
miami
deco
restaurants
and
the
fish
in
front
of
her
was
practically
a
sculpture
so
thoroughly
plated
it
was
well
i
as
californian
as
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
she
said
and
laughed
a
canadian
joke
but
it
applies
equally
well
to
californians
so
you
were
in
when
ninety
eight
to
interesting
times
to
be
in
the
valley
i
read
your
column
you
know
she
looked
down
at
her
plate
a
lot
of
people
had
read
the
column
back
then
women
columnists
were
rare
in
tech
and
she
supposed
she
was
good
at
it
too
i
hope
i
get
remembered
as
more
than
the
chronicler
of
the
boom
though
she
said
oh
you
will
he
said
you
be
remembered
as
the
chronicler
of
this
what
kettlewell
and
perry
and
lester
are
doing
what
you
doing
too
right
oh
yes
what
i
doing
too
a
robot
rollerbladed
past
on
the
boardwalk
turning
the
occasional
somersault
i
should
have
them
build
some
of
those
tjan
said
watching
the
crowd
turn
to
regard
it
it
hopped
onto
and
off
of
the
curb
expertly
steered
around
the
wandering
couples
and
the
occasional
homeless
person
it
had
a
banner
it
streamed
out
behind
it
jacks
paintball
and
fanboat
tours
get
shot
and
get
wet
miami
key
west
lauderdale
you
think
they
can
sure
tjan
said
those
two
can
build
anything
that
the
point
any
moderately
skilled
practitioner
can
build
anything
these
days
for
practically
nothing
back
in
the
old
days
the
blacksmith
just
made
every
bit
of
ironmongery
everyone
needed
one
piece
at
a
time
at
his
forge
that
where
we
at
every
industry
that
required
a
factory
yesterday
only
needs
a
garage
today
it
a
real
return
to
fundamentals
what
no
one
ever
could
do
was
join
up
all
the
smithies
and
all
the
smiths
and
make
them
into
a
single
logical
network
with
a
single
set
of
objectives
that
new
and
it
what
i
plan
on
making
hay
out
of
this
will
be
much
bigger
than
it
will
be
much
harder
too
bigger
crests
deeper
troughs
this
is
something
to
chronicle
all
right
it
will
make
look
like
a
warm
up
for
the
main
show
we
going
to
create
a
new
class
of
artisans
who
can
change
careers
every
months
inventing
new
jobs
that
had
been
imagined
a
year
before
that
a
pretty
unstable
market
suzanne
said
and
ate
some
fish
that
a
market
here
what
i
think
the
point
of
a
good
market
is
in
a
good
market
you
invent
something
and
you
charge
all
the
market
will
bear
for
it
someone
else
figures
out
how
to
do
it
cheaper
or
decides
they
can
do
it
for
a
slimmer
margin
not
the
same
thing
you
know
in
the
first
case
someone
is
more
efficient
and
in
the
second
they
just
less
greedy
or
less
ambitious
they
do
it
and
so
you
have
to
drop
your
prices
to
compete
then
someone
comes
along
who
less
greedy
or
more
efficient
than
both
of
you
and
undercuts
you
again
and
again
and
again
until
eventually
you
get
down
to
a
kind
of
firmament
a
baseline
that
you
ca
go
lower
than
the
cheapest
you
can
produce
a
good
and
stay
in
business
that
why
straightpins
machine
screws
and
reams
of
paper
all
cost
basically
nothing
and
make
damned
little
profit
for
their
manufacturers
so
if
you
want
to
make
a
big
profit
you
got
to
start
over
again
invent
something
new
and
milk
it
for
all
you
can
before
the
first
imitator
shows
up
the
more
this
happens
the
cheaper
and
better
everything
gets
it
how
we
got
here
you
see
it
what
the
system
is
we
approaching
a
kind
of
pure
and
perfect
state
now
with
competition
and
invention
getting
easier
and
easier
it
producing
a
kind
of
superabundance
that
amazing
to
watch
my
kids
just
surf
it
make
themselves
over
every
six
months
learn
a
new
interface
a
new
entertainment
you
name
it
he
trailed
off
you
have
kids
in
st
petersburg
with
their
mother
she
could
tell
by
his
tone
that
it
had
been
the
wrong
question
to
ask
he
was
looking
hangdog
well
it
must
be
nice
to
be
so
much
closer
to
them
than
you
were
in
ithaca
what
no
no
the
st
petersburg
in
oh
she
said
they
concentrated
on
their
food
for
a
while
you
know
he
said
after
they
ordered
coffee
and
desert
it
all
about
abundance
i
want
my
kids
to
grow
up
with
abundance
and
whatever
is
going
on
right
now
it
providing
abundance
in
abundance
the
industry
is
bigger
than
the
recording
industry
did
you
know
that
all
they
do
is
provide
a
place
to
put
stuff
that
we
own
that
we
ca
find
room
for
superabundance
i
have
a
locker
in
milpitas
she
said
there
you
go
it
a
growth
industry
he
drank
his
coffee
on
the
way
back
to
their
cars
he
said
my
daughter
lyenitchka
is
four
and
my
son
sasha
is
one
i
have
lived
with
their
mother
in
three
years
he
made
a
face
sasha
circumstances
were
complicated
they
good
kids
though
it
just
could
work
with
their
mother
she
russian
and
connected
that
how
we
met
i
was
hustling
for
my
business
and
she
had
some
good
connections
so
after
the
divorce
there
was
no
question
of
my
taking
the
kids
with
me
but
they
good
kids
do
you
see
them
we
videoconference
who
knew
that
divorce
was
the
killer
app
for
videoconferencing
yeah
that
week
suzanne
tweeted
constantly
filed
two
columns
and
blogged
ten
or
more
items
a
day
photos
bits
of
discussion
between
lester
perry
and
tjan
a
couple
videos
of
the
boogie
woogie
elmos
doing
improbable
things
turned
out
that
there
was
quite
a
cult
following
for
the
bwe
and
the
news
that
there
was
a
trove
of
some
thousands
of
them
in
a
hollywood
dump
sent
a
pilgrims
winging
their
way
across
the
nation
to
score
some
for
the
collectors
market
perry
would
even
take
their
money
fella
he
told
one
persistent
dealer
i
got
forty
of
these
things
i
wo
miss
a
couple
dozen
just
call
it
good
karma
when
tjan
found
out
about
it
he
pursed
his
lips
for
a
moment
then
said
let
me
know
if
someone
wants
to
pay
us
money
please
i
think
you
were
right
but
i
like
to
have
a
say
all
right
perry
looked
at
suzanne
who
was
videoing
this
exchange
with
her
keychain
then
he
looked
back
at
tjan
yeah
of
course
sorry
force
of
habit
no
harm
done
though
right
that
footage
got
downloaded
a
couple
hundred
times
that
night
but
once
it
got
slashdotted
by
a
couple
of
headline
aggregators
she
found
her
server
hammered
with
a
hundred
thousand
requests
the
merc
had
the
horsepower
to
serve
them
all
but
you
never
knew
every
once
in
a
while
the
web
hit
another
tipping
point
and
grew
by
an
order
of
magnitude
or
so
and
then
all
the
calculated
to
survive
the
old
slashdottings
shredded
like
wet
kleenex
from
to
schurch
subject
re
embedded
journalist
this
stuff
is
amazing
amazing
christ
i
should
put
you
on
the
payroll
forget
i
wrote
that
but
i
should
you
got
a
fantastic
eye
i
have
never
felt
as
in
touch
with
my
own
business
as
i
do
at
this
moment
not
to
mention
proud
proud
you
made
me
so
proud
of
the
work
these
guys
are
doing
proud
to
have
some
role
in
it
kettlebelly
she
read
it
sitting
up
in
her
coffin
just
one
of
several
hundred
emails
from
that
day
and
column
she
laughed
and
dropped
it
in
her
folder
of
correspondence
to
answer
it
was
nearly
midnight
too
late
to
get
into
it
with
kettlewell
then
her
computer
rang
the
she
forwarded
her
cellphone
to
when
her
computer
was
live
and
connected
she
started
doing
that
a
couple
years
back
when
really
stabilized
and
her
phone
bills
had
dropped
to
less
than
twenty
bucks
a
month
down
from
several
hundred
it
was
that
she
spent
a
lot
of
time
within
arm
reach
of
a
live
computer
but
given
that
calls
routed
through
the
laptop
were
free
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
defer
her
calls
until
she
was
hi
jimmy
she
said
her
editor
back
in
san
jose
pacific
time
on
a
weeknight
was
still
working
hours
for
him
suzanne
he
said
she
waited
she
half
expected
him
to
call
with
a
little
shower
of
praise
an
echo
of
kettlewell
note
jimmy
was
the
most
effusive
editor
she
had
but
it
made
his
little
moments
of
praise
more
valuable
for
their
rarity
suzanne
he
said
again
jimmy
she
said
it
late
here
what
up
so
it
like
this
i
love
your
reports
but
it
not
silicon
valley
news
it
miami
news
mcclatchy
handed
me
a
thirty
percent
cut
this
morning
and
i
going
to
the
bone
i
am
firing
a
third
of
the
newsroom
today
now
you
are
a
stupendous
writer
and
so
i
said
to
myself
can
fire
her
or
i
can
bring
her
home
and
have
her
write
about
silicon
valley
again
and
i
knew
what
the
answer
had
to
be
so
i
need
you
to
come
home
just
wrap
it
up
and
come
home
he
finished
speaking
and
she
found
herself
staring
at
her
screen
her
hands
were
gripping
the
laptop
edges
so
tightly
it
hurt
and
the
machine
made
a
plasticky
squeak
as
it
began
to
bend
i
ca
do
that
jimmy
this
is
stuff
that
silicon
valley
needs
to
know
about
this
may
not
be
what
happening
silicon
valley
but
it
sure
as
shit
is
what
happening
silicon
valley
she
hated
that
she
cussed
she
had
meant
to
i
know
you
in
a
hard
spot
but
this
is
the
story
i
need
to
cover
right
now
suzanne
i
cutting
a
third
of
the
newsroom
we
going
to
be
covering
stories
within
driving
distance
of
this
office
for
the
foreseeable
future
and
that
it
i
do
disagree
with
a
single
thing
you
just
said
but
it
does
matter
if
i
leave
you
where
you
are
i
have
to
cut
the
guy
who
covers
the
school
boards
and
the
city
councils
i
ca
do
that
not
if
i
want
to
remain
a
daily
newspaper
editor
i
see
she
said
can
i
think
about
it
think
about
what
suzanne
this
has
not
been
the
best
day
for
me
i
have
to
tell
you
but
i
do
see
what
there
is
to
think
about
this
newspaper
no
longer
has
correspondents
who
work
in
miami
and
london
and
paris
and
new
york
as
of
today
that
stuff
comes
from
bloggers
or
off
the
wire
or
whatever
but
not
from
our
payroll
you
work
for
this
newspaper
so
you
need
to
come
back
here
because
the
job
doing
does
not
exist
any
longer
the
job
you
have
with
us
is
here
you
missed
the
but
there
a
direct
flight
tomorrow
morning
that
have
you
back
by
lunchtime
tomorrow
and
we
can
sit
down
together
then
and
talk
about
it
all
right
i
think
she
felt
that
feeling
again
that
feeling
that
tension
from
her
toes
to
her
nose
jimmy
she
said
i
need
a
leave
of
absence
ok
what
suzanne
i
sure
we
owe
you
some
vacation
but
now
is
the
time
not
a
vacation
jimmy
six
months
leave
of
absence
without
pay
her
savings
could
cover
it
she
could
put
some
banner
ads
on
her
blog
florida
was
cheap
she
could
rent
out
her
place
in
california
she
was
six
steps
into
the
plan
and
it
had
only
taken
ten
seconds
and
she
had
no
doubts
whatsoever
she
could
talk
to
that
who
pinged
her
last
year
see
about
getting
an
advance
on
a
book
about
kodacell
are
you
quitting
no
jimmy
well
not
unless
you
make
me
but
i
need
to
stay
here
the
work
you
doing
there
is
fine
suzanne
but
i
worked
really
hard
to
protect
your
job
here
and
this
is
going
to
help
make
that
happen
what
are
you
saying
if
you
want
to
work
for
the
merc
you
need
to
fly
back
to
san
jose
where
the
merc
is
published
i
ca
make
it
any
clearer
than
that
no
he
could
she
sympathized
with
him
she
was
really
well
paid
by
the
merc
keeping
her
on
would
mean
firing
two
junior
writers
cut
her
a
lot
of
breaks
along
the
way
too
let
her
feel
out
the
valley
in
her
own
way
it
had
paid
off
for
both
of
them
but
taken
the
risk
when
a
lot
of
people
would
have
she
be
a
fool
to
walk
away
from
all
that
she
opened
her
mouth
to
tell
him
that
she
be
on
the
plane
in
the
morning
and
what
came
out
was
jimmy
i
really
appreciate
all
the
work
you
done
for
me
but
this
is
the
story
i
need
to
write
sorry
about
that
suzanne
he
said
thank
you
jimmy
she
said
i
get
back
to
california
when
i
get
a
lull
and
sort
out
the
details
my
employee
card
and
stuff
you
know
what
you
doing
right
yeah
she
said
i
do
when
she
unscrewed
her
earpiece
she
discovered
that
her
neck
was
killing
her
that
made
her
realize
that
she
was
a
woman
in
america
without
health
insurance
or
regular
income
she
was
a
journalist
without
a
journalistic
organ
she
have
to
tell
kettlewell
who
would
no
doubt
offer
to
put
her
on
the
payroll
she
could
do
that
of
course
neutrality
was
hard
enough
to
maintain
never
mind
being
financially
compromised
she
stepped
out
of
the
coffin
and
sniffed
the
salty
air
living
in
the
coffin
was
expensive
she
need
to
get
a
condo
or
something
a
place
with
a
kitchen
where
she
could
prep
meals
she
figured
that
building
would
probably
have
a
vacancy
or
two
the
second
business
that
tjan
took
perry
into
was
even
more
successful
than
the
first
and
that
was
saying
something
it
only
took
a
week
for
tjan
to
get
perry
and
lester
cranking
on
a
kitchen
gnome
design
that
mashed
together
some
homeland
security
software
with
a
big
and
a
microphone
and
a
little
camera
all
packaged
together
in
one
of
a
couple
hundred
designs
of
a
figurine
that
stood
six
inches
tall
it
could
recognize
every
member
of
a
household
by
the
way
they
walked
and
play
back
for
each
it
turned
out
to
be
a
killer
tool
for
reminders
to
kids
to
do
the
dishes
and
for
husbands
wives
and
roommates
to
nag
each
other
without
getting
on
each
nerves
tjan
was
really
jazzed
about
it
as
it
tied
in
with
some
theories
he
had
about
the
changing
us
demographic
trending
towards
blended
households
in
urban
centers
with
three
or
more
adults
this
is
a
rich
vein
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
together
living
communally
is
hard
and
technology
can
make
it
easier
roommate
ware
it
the
wave
of
the
future
there
was
another
kodacell
group
in
san
francisco
a
design
outfit
with
a
bunch
of
stringers
who
could
design
the
gnomes
for
them
and
they
did
great
work
the
gnomes
were
slightly
and
they
were
the
product
of
a
generative
algorithm
that
varied
each
one
some
of
the
designs
that
fell
out
of
the
algorithm
were
weird
perry
kept
a
version
on
his
desk
they
tooled
up
to
make
them
by
the
hundred
then
the
thousand
then
the
tens
of
thousand
the
fact
that
each
one
was
different
kept
their
margins
up
but
as
the
gnomes
gained
popularity
their
sales
were
steadily
eroded
by
mostly
from
eastern
europe
the
knockoffs
were
as
though
they
were
certainly
weirder
looking
like
the
offspring
of
a
norwegian
troll
and
an
anime
robot
but
they
were
more
some
smart
hacker
in
russia
was
packing
all
kinds
of
functionality
onto
a
single
chip
so
that
their
trolls
cost
less
and
did
more
burglar
alarms
streaming
internet
radio
source
and
medical
diagnostic
that
relied
on
quack
analysis
of
eye
pigment
tongue
coating
and
other
newage
rhymes
with
sewage
indicators
lester
came
back
from
the
dollar
store
with
a
big
bag
of
trolls
a
dozen
different
models
and
dumped
them
out
on
tjan
desk
up
in
old
foreman
offices
on
the
catwalk
above
the
workspaces
christ
would
you
look
at
these
they
selling
them
for
less
than
our
cost
to
manufacture
how
do
we
compete
with
this
we
do
tjan
said
and
rubbed
his
belly
now
we
do
the
next
thing
what
the
next
thing
perry
said
well
the
first
one
delivered
a
at
about
twenty
times
the
rate
of
any
kodak
or
duracell
business
unit
in
the
history
of
either
company
but
i
like
to
shoot
for
thirty
to
forty
times
next
if
that
all
right
with
you
so
let
go
see
what
invented
this
week
and
how
we
can
commercialize
it
perry
and
lester
just
looked
at
each
other
finally
lester
said
can
you
repeat
that
the
typical
roi
for
a
kodacell
unit
in
the
old
days
was
about
four
percent
if
you
put
a
hundred
dollars
in
you
get
a
hundred
and
four
dollars
out
and
it
would
take
about
a
year
to
realize
of
course
in
the
old
days
they
would
have
touched
a
new
business
unless
they
could
put
a
hundred
million
in
and
get
a
hundred
and
four
million
out
four
million
bucks
is
four
million
bucks
but
here
the
company
put
fifty
thousand
into
these
dolls
and
three
months
later
they
took
seventy
thousand
out
after
paying
our
salaries
and
bonuses
that
a
forty
percent
roi
seventy
thousand
bucks
is
four
million
bucks
but
forty
percent
is
forty
percent
not
to
mention
that
our
business
drove
similar
margins
in
three
other
business
units
i
thought
we
screwed
up
by
letting
these
guys
eat
our
lunch
lester
said
indicating
the
trolls
nope
we
got
in
while
the
margins
were
high
made
a
good
return
and
now
we
get
out
as
the
margins
drop
that
not
screwing
up
doing
the
right
thing
the
next
time
around
we
do
something
more
capital
intensive
and
we
take
out
an
even
higher
margin
so
show
me
something
that
cost
two
hundred
grand
to
get
going
and
that
we
can
pull
a
hundred
and
sixty
thou
worth
of
profit
out
of
for
kodacell
in
three
months
let
do
something
ambitious
this
time
around
suzanne
took
copious
notes
there
been
a
couple
weeks
awkwardness
early
on
about
her
scribbling
as
they
talked
or
videoing
with
her
keychain
but
once
she
moved
into
the
building
with
the
guys
taking
a
condo
on
the
next
floor
up
she
become
just
a
member
of
the
team
albeit
a
member
who
tweeted
nearly
every
word
they
uttered
to
a
feed
that
was
adding
new
subscribers
by
the
tens
of
thousands
so
perry
what
have
you
got
for
tjan
she
asked
i
came
up
with
the
last
one
he
said
grinning
they
always
ended
up
grinning
when
tjan
ran
down
economics
for
them
let
lester
take
this
one
lester
looked
shy
he
never
fully
recovered
from
suzanne
turning
him
down
and
when
she
was
in
the
room
he
always
looked
like
rather
be
somewhere
else
he
participated
in
the
message
boards
on
her
blog
though
the
most
prolific
poster
in
a
field
with
thousands
of
very
prolific
posters
when
he
posted
others
listened
he
was
witty
charming
and
always
right
well
i
been
thinking
a
lot
about
i
know
that
tjan
just
crazy
for
that
stuff
i
been
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
you
guys
are
such
excellent
roomies
so
i
have
to
think
back
to
my
college
days
to
remember
what
a
bad
roommate
is
like
where
the
friction
is
mostly
it
comes
down
to
resource
contention
though
i
wan
na
cook
but
your
dishes
are
in
the
sink
i
wan
na
do
laundry
but
your
boxers
are
in
the
dryer
i
wan
na
watch
tv
but
your
crap
is
all
over
the
living
room
sofa
living
upstairs
from
the
guys
gave
her
fresh
insight
into
how
the
kodacell
philosophy
would
work
out
kettlewell
was
really
big
on
communal
living
putting
these
people
into
each
other
pockets
like
the
geek
houses
of
hackers
getting
that
camaraderie
it
had
taken
a
weekend
to
put
the
most
precious
stuff
in
her
california
house
into
storage
and
then
turn
over
the
keys
to
a
realtor
who
sort
out
leasing
it
for
her
the
monthly
check
from
the
realtor
left
more
than
enough
for
her
to
pay
the
rent
in
florida
and
then
some
and
once
the
ups
man
dropped
off
the
five
boxes
of
personal
effects
she
chosen
she
was
practically
at
home
she
sat
alone
over
the
guys
apartments
in
the
evenings
windows
open
so
that
their
muffled
conversations
could
drift
in
and
form
the
soundtrack
as
she
wrote
her
columns
it
made
her
feel
curiously
with
but
not
of
their
movement
a
reasonable
proxy
for
journalistic
objectivity
in
this
age
of
relativism
resource
contention
readily
decomposes
into
a
bunch
of
smaller
problems
with
distinctive
solutions
take
dishes
every
dishwasher
should
be
designed
with
a
and
a
compartment
basically
two
logical
dishwashers
you
take
clean
dishes
out
of
the
clean
side
use
them
and
put
them
into
the
dirty
side
when
the
dirty
side
is
full
the
clean
side
is
empty
so
you
cycle
the
dishwasher
and
the
clean
side
becomes
dirty
and
i
had
some
sketches
for
designs
that
would
make
this
happen
but
it
did
feel
right
making
dishwashers
is
too
industrial
for
us
i
either
like
making
big
chunks
of
art
or
little
silver
things
you
can
carry
in
your
pocket
she
smiled
despite
herself
she
was
drawing
a
readers
a
day
by
doing
besides
repeating
the
conversations
around
her
it
had
taken
her
a
month
to
consider
putting
ads
on
the
site
lots
of
feelers
from
blog
who
wanted
to
get
her
under
management
and
into
their
banner
networks
and
she
broke
down
when
one
of
them
showed
her
a
little
spreadsheet
detailing
the
kind
of
long
green
she
could
expect
to
bring
in
from
a
couple
of
little
banners
with
her
getting
the
right
to
personally
approve
every
advertiser
in
the
network
the
first
month
she
made
more
money
than
all
but
the
most
senior
writers
on
the
merc
the
next
month
outstripped
her
own
old
salary
she
covered
commercial
blogs
the
flamboyant
who
bought
stupid
cars
and
ridiculous
bimbos
with
the
money
but
she
always
assumed
they
were
in
a
different
league
from
a
newspaper
scribbler
now
she
supposed
all
the
money
meant
that
she
should
make
it
official
and
phone
in
a
resignation
to
jimmy
but
they
left
it
pretty
ambiguous
as
to
whether
she
was
retiring
or
taking
a
leave
of
absence
and
she
was
reluctant
to
collapse
that
waveform
into
the
certainty
of
saying
goodbye
to
her
old
life
so
i
got
to
thinking
about
radio
frequency
id
gizmos
remember
those
when
we
started
talking
about
them
a
decade
ago
all
the
privacy
people
went
crazy
totally
sure
that
these
things
would
be
bad
news
the
geeks
dismissed
them
as
not
understanding
the
technology
supposedly
an
rfid
can
only
be
read
from
a
couple
inches
away
if
someone
wanted
to
find
out
what
rfids
you
had
on
your
person
they
have
to
wand
you
and
you
know
about
it
yeah
that
was
bull
perry
said
i
mean
sure
you
ca
read
an
rfid
unless
it
been
excited
with
electromagnetic
radiation
and
you
ca
do
that
from
a
hundred
yards
without
frying
everything
between
you
and
the
target
but
if
you
had
a
subway
turnstile
with
an
exciter
built
into
it
you
could
snipe
all
the
tag
numbers
from
a
distant
roof
with
a
directional
antenna
if
those
things
had
caught
on
there
be
exciters
everywhere
and
you
be
able
to
track
anyone
you
wanted
christ
they
even
put
rfids
in
the
bill
for
a
while
pickpockets
could
have
figured
out
whose
purse
was
worth
snatching
from
half
a
mile
a
way
all
true
lester
said
but
that
did
stop
these
guys
there
are
still
a
couple
of
them
around
limping
along
without
many
customers
they
print
the
tags
with
inkjets
sized
down
to
about
a
third
the
size
of
a
grain
of
rice
mostly
used
in
management
and
such
they
can
supply
them
on
the
cheap
which
brings
me
to
my
idea
why
not
tag
everything
in
a
group
household
and
use
the
tags
to
figure
out
who
left
the
dishes
in
the
sink
who
took
the
hammer
out
and
did
put
it
back
who
put
the
empty
back
in
the
fridge
and
who
got
the
tv
remote
it
wo
solve
resource
contention
but
it
will
limit
the
social
factors
that
contribute
to
it
he
looked
around
at
them
we
can
make
it
fun
you
know
make
cool
rfid
sticker
designs
mod
the
little
gnome
dolls
to
act
as
terminals
for
getting
reports
suzanne
found
herself
nodding
along
she
could
use
this
kind
of
thing
even
though
she
lived
alone
just
to
help
her
find
out
where
she
left
her
glasses
and
the
tv
remote
perry
shook
his
head
though
when
i
was
a
kid
i
had
a
really
bad
relationship
with
my
mom
she
was
really
smart
but
she
did
have
a
lot
of
time
to
reason
things
out
with
me
so
often
as
not
she
get
out
of
arguing
with
me
by
just
changing
her
story
so
i
say
can
i
go
to
the
mall
this
aft
and
she
say
no
problem
then
when
i
was
getting
ready
to
leave
the
house
she
ask
me
where
i
thought
i
was
going
i
say
the
mall
you
said
and
she
just
deny
it
just
deny
it
point
blank
i
do
think
she
even
knew
she
was
doing
it
i
think
when
i
asked
her
if
i
could
go
she
just
absentmindedly
say
yes
but
when
it
actually
came
time
to
go
out
she
suddenly
remember
all
my
unfinished
chores
my
homework
all
the
reasons
i
should
stay
home
i
think
every
kid
gets
this
from
their
folks
but
it
made
me
fucking
crazy
so
i
got
a
mini
tape
recorder
and
i
started
to
her
when
she
gave
me
permission
i
thought
i
really
nail
her
the
next
time
she
changed
her
tune
play
her
own
words
back
in
her
ear
so
i
tried
it
and
you
know
what
happened
she
gave
me
nine
kinds
of
holy
hell
for
wearing
a
wire
and
then
she
said
it
did
matter
what
she
said
that
morning
she
was
my
mother
and
i
had
chores
to
do
and
no
was
i
going
now
that
i
started
sneaking
around
the
house
with
a
hidden
recorder
she
took
it
away
and
threw
it
in
the
trash
and
to
top
it
off
she
called
me
edgar
for
a
month
so
here
my
question
how
would
you
feel
if
the
next
time
you
left
the
dishes
in
the
sink
i
showed
up
with
the
audit
trail
for
the
dishes
and
waved
it
in
your
face
how
would
we
get
from
that
point
to
a
happy
harmonious
household
i
think
you
mistaken
the
cause
for
the
effect
the
problem
with
dishes
in
the
sink
is
just
that
it
a
pain
when
i
want
to
cook
a
meal
it
that
when
you
leave
them
in
the
sink
you
being
inconsiderate
and
the
you
left
them
in
the
sink
as
you
pointed
out
is
that
putting
dishes
in
the
dishwasher
is
a
pain
in
the
ass
you
have
to
bend
over
you
have
to
empty
it
out
and
so
on
if
we
moved
the
dishwasher
into
the
kitchen
cupboards
and
turned
half
of
them
into
a
dirty
side
and
half
into
a
clean
side
then
disposing
of
dishes
would
be
as
easy
as
getting
them
out
lester
laughed
and
so
did
tjan
yeah
yeah
point
taken
but
these
rfid
things
they
so
frigging
cheap
and
potentially
useful
i
just
ca
believe
that
they
never
found
a
single
really
compelling
use
in
all
this
time
it
just
seems
like
an
opportunity
that
going
to
waste
maybe
it
a
dead
end
maybe
it
an
ornithopter
inventors
spent
hundreds
of
years
trying
to
build
an
airplane
that
flew
by
flapping
its
wings
and
it
was
all
a
i
guess
lester
said
but
i
do
like
the
idea
like
it
or
do
perry
said
does
affect
whether
it
true
or
not
but
lester
had
a
sparkle
in
his
eye
and
he
disappeared
into
his
workshop
for
a
week
and
would
let
them
in
which
was
unheard
of
for
the
big
gregarious
giant
he
liked
to
drag
the
others
in
whenever
he
accomplished
anything
of
note
show
it
off
to
them
like
a
big
kid
that
was
sunday
monday
suzanne
got
a
call
from
her
realtor
your
tenants
have
vanished
she
said
vanished
the
couple
who
rented
her
place
had
been
as
reliable
as
anyone
she
ever
met
in
the
valley
he
worked
at
a
pr
agency
she
worked
in
marketing
at
google
or
maybe
he
worked
in
marketing
and
she
was
in
pr
at
google
whatever
they
were
affluent
and
had
paid
the
extortionate
rent
she
charged
without
batting
an
eye
they
normally
paypal
the
rent
to
me
on
the
first
but
not
this
month
i
called
and
left
voicemail
the
next
day
then
followed
up
with
an
email
yesterday
i
went
by
the
house
and
it
was
empty
all
their
stuff
was
gone
no
food
in
the
fridge
i
think
they
might
have
taken
your
home
theater
stuff
too
you
fucking
kidding
me
suzanne
said
it
was
in
florida
and
she
was
into
her
second
glass
of
lemonade
as
the
sun
began
to
superheat
the
air
back
in
california
it
was
her
realtor
was
pulling
long
hours
and
it
was
her
fault
sorry
right
ok
what
about
the
deposit
you
waived
it
she
had
it
had
seemed
like
a
big
deal
at
the
time
the
distant
owner
of
the
condo
she
was
renting
in
florida
had
asked
for
one
so
i
did
now
what
you
want
to
swear
out
a
complaint
against
them
with
the
police
yeah
breach
of
contract
theft
if
they
took
the
home
theater
we
can
take
them
to
collections
too
goddamned
marketing
people
had
the
collective
morals
of
a
snake
all
of
them
useless
conniving
shallow
she
never
should
have
yeah
and
what
about
the
house
we
can
find
you
another
tenant
by
the
end
of
the
month
sure
maybe
a
little
earlier
have
you
thought
any
more
about
selling
it
she
had
though
the
realtor
brought
it
up
every
time
they
spoke
is
now
a
good
time
lot
of
new
millionaires
in
the
valley
shopping
for
houses
suzanne
more
than
i
seen
in
years
she
named
a
sum
that
was
a
third
higher
than
the
last
time
they
talked
it
over
is
it
peaking
who
knows
it
might
go
up
it
might
collapse
again
but
now
is
the
best
time
to
sell
in
the
past
ten
years
you
be
smart
to
do
it
she
took
a
deep
breath
the
valley
was
dead
full
of
venal
marketing
people
and
here
in
florida
she
was
on
the
cusp
of
the
next
thing
and
it
was
happening
in
the
valley
it
was
happening
everywhere
the
valley
in
the
cheap
places
where
innovation
could
happen
at
low
rents
leaky
hot
tub
incredible
property
taxes
and
the
crazy
ride
up
percent
this
month
down
forty
next
the
bubble
was
going
to
burst
some
day
and
she
should
sell
out
now
sell
it
she
said
you
going
to
be
a
wealthy
lady
the
realtor
said
right
suzanne
said
i
have
a
buyer
suzanne
i
did
want
to
pressure
you
but
i
can
sell
it
by
friday
close
escrow
next
week
cash
in
hand
by
the
fifteenth
jesus
she
said
you
joking
no
joke
the
realtor
said
i
got
a
waiting
list
for
houses
on
your
block
and
so
suzanne
got
on
an
airplane
that
night
and
flew
back
to
san
jose
and
took
a
pricey
taxi
back
to
her
place
the
marketdroids
had
left
it
in
pretty
good
shape
clean
and
tidy
clean
sheets
in
the
linen
cupboard
she
made
up
her
bed
and
reflected
that
this
would
be
the
last
time
she
made
this
bed
the
next
time
she
stripped
the
sheets
they
go
into
a
storage
box
she
done
this
before
on
her
way
out
of
detroit
packing
up
a
life
into
boxes
and
shoving
it
into
storage
what
had
tjan
said
the
industry
is
bigger
than
the
recording
industry
did
you
know
that
all
they
do
is
provide
a
place
to
put
stuff
that
we
own
that
we
ca
find
room
for
superabundance
before
bed
she
posted
a
classified
on
craigslist
for
a
couple
helpers
to
work
on
boxing
stuff
emailed
jimmy
to
see
if
he
wanted
lunch
and
looked
up
the
address
for
the
central
police
station
to
swear
out
her
complaint
the
amp
speakers
and
switcher
were
all
missing
from
her
home
theater
she
had
a
dozen
helpers
to
choose
from
the
next
morning
she
picked
two
who
came
with
decent
references
marveling
that
it
was
suddenly
possible
in
silicon
valley
to
get
anyone
to
show
up
anywhere
for
ten
bucks
an
hour
the
police
sergeant
who
took
the
complaint
was
sympathetic
and
agreed
with
her
choice
to
get
out
of
town
i
had
it
with
this
place
too
soon
as
my
kids
are
out
of
moving
back
to
montana
i
miss
the
weather
she
did
think
of
the
marketdroids
again
until
the
next
day
when
she
and
her
helpers
were
boxing
up
the
last
of
her
things
and
loading
them
into
her
then
a
bmw
convertible
screeched
around
the
corner
and
burned
rubber
up
to
her
door
the
woman
marketdroid
was
driving
looking
crazy
and
disheveled
eyes
one
heel
broken
off
of
her
shoes
what
the
fuck
is
your
problem
lady
she
said
as
she
leapt
out
of
her
car
and
stalked
toward
suzanne
instinctively
suzanne
shrank
back
and
dropped
the
box
of
books
she
was
holding
it
spilled
out
over
her
lawn
fiona
she
said
what
happened
i
was
they
came
to
my
workplace
and
led
me
out
in
handcuffs
i
had
to
make
suzanne
stomach
shrank
to
a
little
pebble
impossibly
heavy
what
was
i
supposed
to
do
you
two
took
off
with
my
home
theater
what
home
theater
everything
was
right
where
you
left
it
when
i
went
i
have
lived
here
in
tom
left
me
last
month
and
i
moved
out
you
moved
out
yeah
bitch
i
tom
was
your
tenant
not
me
if
he
ripped
something
off
that
between
you
and
him
look
fiona
wait
hold
up
a
second
i
tried
to
call
you
i
sent
you
email
no
one
was
paying
the
rent
no
one
told
me
that
you
moved
out
and
no
one
answered
when
i
tried
to
find
out
what
had
happened
that
sounds
like
an
she
said
hissing
i
waiting
for
a
fucking
they
took
me
to
suzanne
knew
that
the
local
lockup
was
a
long
way
from
prison
i
apologize
she
said
can
i
get
you
a
cup
of
coffee
would
you
like
to
use
the
shower
or
anything
the
woman
glared
at
her
a
moment
longer
then
slowly
folded
in
on
herself
collapsing
coughing
and
sobbing
on
the
lawn
suzanne
stood
with
her
arms
at
her
sides
for
a
moment
her
craigslist
helpers
had
gone
home
so
she
was
all
alone
and
this
woman
whom
she
met
only
once
before
in
passing
was
clearly
having
some
real
problems
not
the
kind
of
thing
she
dealt
with
a
lot
her
life
did
include
much
but
what
can
you
do
she
knelt
beside
fiona
in
the
grass
and
took
her
hand
let
get
you
inside
ok
at
first
it
was
as
though
she
had
heard
but
slowly
she
straightened
up
and
let
suzanne
lead
her
into
the
house
she
was
young
enough
to
be
suzanne
daughter
if
suzanne
had
gone
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
suzanne
helped
her
to
the
sofa
and
sat
her
down
amid
the
boxes
still
waiting
to
go
into
the
the
kitchen
was
packed
up
but
she
had
a
couple
bottles
of
diet
coke
in
the
cooler
and
she
handed
one
to
the
girl
i
really
sorry
fiona
why
did
you
answer
my
calls
or
email
she
looked
at
suzanne
her
eyes
lost
in
streaks
of
mascara
i
know
i
did
want
to
talk
about
it
he
lost
his
job
last
month
and
kind
of
went
crazy
told
me
he
did
want
the
responsibility
anymore
what
responsibility
but
he
told
me
to
go
told
me
it
would
be
best
for
both
of
us
if
we
were
apart
i
thought
it
was
another
girl
but
i
do
know
maybe
it
was
just
craziness
everyone
i
know
out
here
is
crazy
they
all
work
a
hundred
hours
a
week
they
get
fired
or
quit
their
jobs
every
five
months
everything
is
so
expensive
my
rent
is
three
quarters
of
my
salary
it
really
hard
suzanne
said
thinking
of
the
easy
lazy
days
in
florida
the
hackers
idyll
that
perry
and
lester
enjoyed
in
their
workshops
tom
was
on
antidepressants
but
he
did
like
taking
them
when
he
was
on
them
he
was
pretty
good
but
when
he
went
off
he
turned
into
i
do
know
he
cry
a
lot
and
shout
it
was
a
good
relationship
but
we
moved
out
here
from
oregon
together
and
known
him
all
my
life
he
was
a
little
moody
before
but
not
like
he
was
here
when
did
you
speak
to
him
last
suzanne
had
found
a
couple
of
of
in
the
medicine
chest
she
hoped
that
was
tom
only
supply
we
have
spoken
since
i
moved
out
an
hour
later
the
mystery
was
solved
the
police
went
to
workplace
and
discovered
that
he
been
fired
the
week
before
they
tried
the
gps
in
his
car
and
it
finked
him
out
as
being
in
a
ghost
mall
parking
lot
near
his
old
office
he
was
dead
behind
the
wheel
a
gun
in
his
hand
shot
through
the
heart
suzanne
took
the
call
and
though
she
tried
to
keep
her
end
of
the
conversation
quiet
and
neutral
fiona
still
on
the
sofa
drinking
the
warm
flat
coke
knew
she
let
out
a
moan
like
a
dog
that
been
kicked
and
then
a
scream
for
suzanne
it
was
all
unreal
senseless
the
cops
told
her
that
her
home
theater
components
were
found
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
no
note
god
oh
god
jesus
you
selfish
shit
fucking
bastard
fiona
sobbed
awkwardly
suzanne
sat
down
beside
her
and
took
her
into
a
hug
her
helpers
were
meeting
her
at
the
the
next
day
to
help
her
unload
the
do
you
have
someone
who
can
stay
with
you
tonight
suzanne
asked
praying
the
answer
was
yes
she
had
a
house
to
move
out
of
christ
she
felt
so
but
she
was
on
a
goddamned
schedule
yes
i
guess
fiona
scrubbed
at
her
eyes
with
her
fists
sure
suzanne
sighed
the
lie
was
plain
who
fiona
stood
up
and
smoothed
out
her
skirt
i
sorry
she
said
and
started
for
the
door
groaning
inwardly
suzanne
blocked
her
you
stay
on
the
sofa
she
said
you
not
driving
in
this
state
i
order
in
pizza
pepperoni
mushroom
ok
looking
defeated
fiona
turned
on
her
heel
and
went
back
to
the
sofa
over
pizza
suzanne
pulled
a
few
details
out
of
her
tom
had
fallen
into
a
funk
when
the
layoffs
had
started
in
his
office
they
were
endemic
across
the
valley
another
bust
was
upon
them
his
behavior
had
grown
worse
and
worse
and
she
finally
left
or
been
thrown
out
it
was
clear
she
was
on
thin
ice
at
google
and
they
were
laying
people
off
too
and
she
was
convinced
that
being
led
out
in
handcuffs
would
be
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel
back
i
should
move
back
to
oregon
she
said
dropping
her
slice
back
on
the
suzanne
had
heard
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
giving
up
on
the
valley
since
she
moved
there
it
was
a
common
thing
being
beaten
down
by
life
in
the
bay
area
you
were
supposed
to
insert
a
pep
talk
here
something
about
hanging
in
about
the
opportunities
here
yes
she
said
that
a
good
idea
you
young
and
there
a
life
for
you
there
you
can
start
something
up
or
go
to
work
for
someone
else
startup
it
felt
weird
coming
out
of
her
mouth
like
a
betrayal
of
the
valley
of
some
tribal
loyalty
to
this
but
after
all
was
she
selling
up
and
moving
east
there
nothing
in
oregon
fiona
said
snuffling
there
something
everywhere
let
me
tell
you
about
some
friends
of
mine
in
florida
and
she
told
her
and
as
she
told
her
she
told
herself
hearing
it
spoken
aloud
even
after
having
written
about
it
and
written
about
it
and
been
there
and
done
it
it
was
different
she
came
to
understand
how
fucking
it
all
was
this
new
entrepreneurial
inventive
amazing
thing
she
was
engaged
in
she
loved
the
contrast
of
nimble
software
companies
when
compared
with
gigantic
brutal
auto
companies
but
what
her
boys
were
doing
it
made
the
software
companies
look
like
lumbering
lummoxes
crashing
around
with
their
fifty
employees
and
their
big
offices
fiona
was
disbelieving
then
interested
then
excited
they
just
make
this
stuff
do
it
then
make
something
else
exactly
no
permanence
except
for
the
team
and
they
support
each
other
live
and
work
together
you
think
that
because
they
live
and
work
together
that
they
do
have
any
balance
but
it
the
opposite
they
book
off
work
at
four
or
sometimes
earlier
go
to
movies
go
out
and
have
fun
read
books
play
catch
it
amazing
i
never
coming
back
here
and
she
never
would
she
told
her
editor
about
this
she
told
her
friends
who
came
to
a
party
at
a
bar
she
used
to
go
to
when
she
went
into
the
office
a
lot
she
told
her
cab
driver
who
picked
her
up
to
take
her
to
the
airport
and
she
told
the
bemused
engineer
who
sat
next
to
her
all
the
way
back
to
miami
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
tell
the
couple
who
bought
her
house
for
a
sum
of
money
that
seemed
to
have
at
least
one
extra
zero
at
the
end
maybe
two
and
so
when
she
got
back
to
miami
she
hardly
noticed
the
incredible
obesity
of
the
man
who
took
the
money
for
the
gas
in
her
leased
car
now
that
she
was
here
for
the
long
haul
she
have
to
look
into
getting
lester
to
help
her
buy
a
used
from
a
junker
lot
and
the
tin
roofs
of
the
shantytowns
she
passed
looked
tropical
and
quaint
the
smell
of
swamp
and
salt
the
humidity
the
bass
thunder
of
the
in
the
traffic
around
her
it
was
like
some
kind
of
sweet
homecoming
for
her
tjan
was
in
the
condo
when
she
got
home
and
he
spotted
her
from
the
balcony
where
he
been
sunning
himself
and
helped
her
bring
up
her
suitcases
of
things
she
could
bear
to
put
in
storage
come
down
to
our
place
for
a
cup
of
coffee
once
you
settled
in
he
said
leaving
her
she
sluiced
off
the
airplane
grease
that
had
filled
her
pores
on
the
long
flight
from
san
jose
to
miami
and
changed
into
a
cheap
and
a
pair
of
that
she
bought
at
the
thunderbird
flea
market
and
headed
down
to
their
place
tjan
opened
the
door
with
a
flourish
and
she
stepped
in
and
stopped
short
when
she
left
the
place
had
been
a
reflection
of
their
jumbled
lives
gizmos
dishes
parts
tools
and
clothes
strewn
everywhere
in
a
kind
of
joyful
like
an
enormous
kitchen
now
the
place
was
and
what
more
it
was
the
floor
was
not
only
clean
it
was
visible
lining
the
walls
were
translucent
white
plastic
tubs
stacked
to
the
ceiling
you
like
it
it
amazing
she
said
like
ikea
meets
what
happened
here
tjan
did
a
little
it
was
lester
idea
have
a
look
in
the
boxes
she
pulled
a
couple
of
the
tubs
out
they
were
with
books
tools
cruft
and
crud
all
the
crap
that
had
previously
cluttered
the
shelves
and
the
floor
and
the
sofa
and
the
coffee
table
watch
this
he
said
he
unvelcroed
a
wireless
keyboard
from
the
side
of
the
tv
and
began
to
type
the
field
autocompleted
itself
the
count
of
monte
cristo
and
brought
up
a
picture
of
a
paperback
along
with
links
to
reviews
and
the
full
text
tjan
gestured
with
his
chin
and
she
saw
that
the
front
of
one
of
the
tubs
was
pulsing
with
a
soft
blue
glow
tjan
went
and
pulled
open
the
tub
and
fished
for
a
second
before
producing
the
book
try
it
he
said
handing
her
the
keyboard
she
began
to
type
experimentally
and
up
came
underwear
no
way
she
said
way
tjan
said
and
hit
return
bringing
up
a
thumbnail
gallery
of
fourteen
pairs
of
underwear
he
tabbed
over
each
picked
out
a
pair
of
simpsons
boxers
and
hit
return
a
different
tub
started
glowing
lester
finally
found
a
socially
beneficial
use
for
rfids
we
going
to
get
rich
i
do
think
i
understand
she
said
come
on
he
said
let
get
to
the
junkyard
lester
explains
this
really
well
he
did
too
losing
all
of
the
shyness
she
remembered
his
eyes
glowing
his
fingers
dancing
have
you
ever
alphabetized
your
hard
drive
i
mean
have
you
ever
spent
any
time
concerning
yourself
with
where
on
your
hard
drive
your
files
are
stored
which
sectors
contain
which
files
computers
abstract
away
the
tedious
physical
properties
of
files
and
leave
us
with
handles
that
we
use
to
persistently
refer
to
them
regardless
of
which
part
of
the
hard
drive
currently
holds
those
particular
bits
so
i
thought
with
rfids
you
could
do
this
with
the
real
world
just
tag
everything
and
have
your
furniture
keep
track
of
where
it
is
one
of
the
big
barriers
to
roommate
harmony
is
the
correct
disposition
of
stuff
when
you
leave
your
book
on
the
sofa
i
have
to
move
it
before
i
can
sit
down
and
watch
tv
then
you
come
after
me
and
ask
me
where
i
put
your
book
then
we
have
a
fight
there
stuff
that
you
do
know
where
it
goes
and
stuff
that
you
do
know
where
been
put
and
stuff
that
has
nowhere
to
put
it
but
with
tags
and
a
smart
chest
of
drawers
you
can
just
put
your
stuff
wherever
room
and
ask
the
physical
space
to
keep
track
of
what
where
from
moment
to
moment
there
still
the
problem
of
getting
everything
tagged
and
described
but
that
a
service
business
opportunity
and
where
you
got
other
shared
identifiers
like
isbns
you
could
use
a
cameraphone
to
snap
the
and
look
them
up
against
public
databases
the
whole
thing
could
be
coordinated
around
cleaning
events
where
you
go
through
your
stuff
and
photograph
it
tag
it
describe
it
good
for
your
insurance
and
for
forensics
if
you
get
robbed
too
he
stopped
and
beamed
folding
his
fingers
over
his
belly
so
it
basically
perry
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
tjan
drummed
his
forefingers
like
a
drummer
on
the
side
of
the
workbench
they
were
gathered
around
they
were
all
waiting
for
her
well
it
very
cool
she
said
at
last
but
the
whole
thing
it
makes
your
apartment
look
like
an
ikea
showroom
kind
of
inhumanly
minimalist
americans
we
like
celebrating
our
stuff
well
ok
fair
enough
lester
said
nodding
you
do
have
to
put
everything
away
of
course
and
you
can
still
have
all
the
decor
you
want
this
is
about
clutter
control
exactly
perry
said
come
check
out
lester
lab
ok
this
is
pretty
perfect
suzanne
said
the
clutter
was
gone
disappeared
into
the
white
tubs
that
were
stacked
high
on
every
shelf
leaving
the
clear
but
lester
his
keepsakes
his
sculptures
and
triptychs
were
still
out
looking
like
venerated
museum
pieces
in
the
stark
tidiness
that
prevailed
otherwise
tjan
took
her
through
the
spreadsheets
there
are
ten
teams
that
do
in
the
network
and
a
bunch
of
shippers
packers
movers
and
storage
experts
a
few
furniture
companies
we
adopted
the
interface
from
some
free
software
apps
that
were
built
for
illiterate
service
employees
lots
of
big
pictures
and
autocompletion
and
we
bought
a
hundred
rfid
printers
from
a
company
that
was
so
grateful
for
a
new
customer
that
they
shipping
us
of
them
so
we
can
print
these
things
at
about
a
million
per
hour
the
plan
is
to
start
our
sales
through
the
consultants
at
the
same
time
as
we
start
showing
at
for
furniture
companies
we
already
got
a
huge
order
from
a
couple
of
local
homes
they
walked
to
the
ihop
to
have
a
celebratory
lunch
being
back
in
florida
felt
just
right
to
her
francis
the
leader
of
the
paramilitary
wing
of
the
aarp
threw
them
a
salute
and
blew
her
a
kiss
and
even
lester
nursing
junkie
friend
seemed
to
be
in
a
good
mood
when
they
were
done
they
brought
bags
for
the
junkie
and
francis
in
the
shantytown
i
want
to
make
some
technology
for
those
guys
perry
said
as
they
sat
in
front
of
francis
rv
drinking
cowboy
coffee
cooked
over
a
banked
off
to
one
side
for
homeless
people
francis
uncrossed
his
bony
ankles
and
scratched
at
his
mosquito
bites
a
lot
of
people
think
that
we
do
buy
stuff
but
it
not
true
he
said
i
shop
hard
for
bargains
but
there
lots
of
stuff
i
spend
more
on
because
of
my
lifestyle
than
i
would
if
i
had
a
real
house
and
steady
electricity
when
i
had
a
i
could
bulk
buy
ground
round
for
about
a
tenth
of
what
i
pay
now
when
i
go
to
the
grocery
store
and
get
enough
for
one
night
dinner
the
alternative
is
using
propane
to
keep
the
fridge
going
overnight
and
that
not
cheap
either
so
i
a
kind
of
premium
customer
back
at
boeing
we
loved
the
people
who
made
small
orders
because
we
could
charge
them
such
a
premium
for
custom
work
while
the
big
airlines
wanted
stuff
done
so
cheap
that
half
the
time
we
lost
money
on
the
deal
perry
nodded
there
you
have
it
for
homeless
people
a
great
and
untapped
market
suzanne
cocked
her
head
and
looked
at
him
you
sounding
awfully
for
a
pure
and
unsullied
engineer
you
know
he
ducked
his
head
and
grinned
and
looked
about
twelve
years
old
it
infectious
those
little
kitchen
gnomes
we
sold
nearly
a
of
those
things
not
to
mention
all
the
a
a
that
we
changed
just
by
thinking
up
something
cool
and
making
it
real
these
rfid
things
of
lester
we
sign
a
couple
million
customers
with
those
people
will
change
everything
about
how
they
live
from
moment
to
moment
because
of
something
lester
thought
up
in
my
junkyard
over
there
well
there
thirty
million
of
us
living
in
what
the
social
workers
call
housing
francis
said
grinning
wryly
he
had
a
funny
smile
that
suzanne
had
found
adorable
until
he
explained
that
he
had
an
untreated
dental
abscess
that
he
could
afford
to
get
fixed
so
that
a
lot
of
difference
you
could
make
yeah
perry
said
yeah
it
sure
is
that
night
she
found
herself
still
blogging
and
answering
emails
they
always
piled
up
when
she
travelled
and
took
a
couple
of
late
nights
to
clear
out
after
nine
pm
sitting
alone
in
a
pool
of
light
in
the
back
corner
of
lester
workshop
that
she
had
staked
out
as
her
office
she
yawned
and
stretched
and
listened
to
her
old
back
crackle
she
hated
feeling
old
and
late
nights
made
her
feel
old
feel
every
extra
ounce
of
fat
on
her
tummy
feel
the
lines
bracketing
her
mouth
and
the
little
bag
of
skin
under
her
chin
she
stood
up
and
pulled
on
a
light
jacket
and
began
to
switch
off
lights
and
get
ready
to
head
home
as
she
poked
her
head
in
office
she
saw
that
she
was
the
only
one
working
late
hey
you
she
said
is
it
time
you
got
going
he
jumped
like
he
been
stuck
with
a
pin
and
gave
a
little
yelp
sorry
he
said
did
hear
you
he
had
a
cardboard
box
on
his
desk
and
had
been
filling
it
with
his
personal
effects
little
inventions
the
guys
had
made
for
him
personal
fetishes
and
tchotchkes
a
framed
picture
of
his
kids
what
up
he
sighed
and
cracked
his
knuckles
might
as
well
tell
you
now
as
tomorrow
morning
i
resigning
she
felt
a
flash
of
anger
and
then
forced
it
down
and
forcibly
replaced
it
with
professional
distance
and
curiosity
mentally
she
licked
her
and
flipped
to
a
blank
page
in
her
notebook
oh
yes
i
had
another
offer
in
westchester
county
westinghouse
has
spun
out
its
own
version
of
kodacell
and
they
looking
for
a
new
to
run
the
division
that
me
good
job
she
said
congratulations
mr
he
shook
his
head
i
emailed
kettlewell
half
an
hour
ago
i
leaving
in
the
morning
i
going
to
say
goodbye
to
the
guys
over
breakfast
not
much
notice
she
said
nope
he
said
a
note
of
anger
creeping
into
his
voice
my
contract
lets
kodacell
fire
me
on
one
day
notice
so
i
insisted
on
the
right
to
quit
on
the
same
terms
maybe
kettlewell
will
get
his
lawyers
to
write
better
boilerplate
from
here
on
in
when
she
had
an
angry
interview
she
habitually
changed
the
subject
to
something
sensitive
angry
people
often
say
more
than
they
intend
to
she
did
it
instinctively
not
really
meaning
to
tjan
whom
she
thought
of
as
a
friend
but
not
letting
that
get
in
the
way
of
the
story
westinghouse
is
doing
what
exactly
it
be
as
big
as
kodacell
operation
in
a
year
he
said
george
westinghouse
personally
funded
tesla
research
you
know
the
company
understands
funding
individual
entrepreneurs
i
going
to
be
training
the
talent
scouts
and
mentoring
the
financial
people
then
turning
them
loose
to
sign
up
entrepreneurs
for
the
westinghouse
network
there
a
competitive
market
for
garage
inventors
now
he
laughed
go
ahead
and
print
that
he
said
blog
it
tonight
competition
now
we
giving
two
points
more
equity
and
charging
half
a
point
less
on
equity
than
the
kodacell
network
that
amazing
tjan
i
hope
you
keep
in
touch
with
me
i
love
to
follow
your
story
count
on
it
he
said
he
laughed
i
getting
a
week
off
every
eight
weeks
to
scout
russia
they
got
an
incredible
culture
of
entrepreneurship
plus
you
get
to
see
your
kids
suzanne
said
that
really
good
plus
i
get
to
see
my
kids
he
admitted
how
much
money
is
westinghouse
putting
into
the
project
she
asked
replacing
her
notional
notebook
with
a
real
one
pulled
from
her
purse
i
do
have
numbers
but
they
shut
down
the
whole
appliances
division
to
clear
the
budget
for
it
she
nodded
she
seen
news
of
the
layoffs
on
the
wires
mass
demonstrations
people
out
of
work
after
twenty
years
service
so
it
a
big
budget
they
must
have
been
impressed
with
the
quarterlies
from
kodacell
tjan
folded
down
the
flaps
on
his
box
and
drummed
his
fingers
on
it
squinting
at
her
you
joking
right
what
do
you
mean
suzanne
they
were
impressed
by
everyone
knows
that
quarterly
numbers
are
easy
to
cook
anything
less
than
two
annual
reports
is
as
likely
to
be
enronning
as
real
but
dispatches
from
here
they
what
sold
them
it
what
convincing
kettlewell
said
that
three
quarters
of
his
new
recruits
come
on
board
after
reading
your
descriptions
of
this
place
how
ended
up
here
she
shook
her
head
that
very
flattering
tjan
but
he
waved
her
off
and
then
surprisingly
came
around
the
desk
and
hugged
her
but
nothing
suzanne
kettlewell
lester
perry
they
all
basically
big
kids
full
of
enthusiasm
and
invention
but
they
got
the
emotional
maturity
and
sense
of
scale
of
hyperactive
five
year
olds
you
and
me
we
grownups
people
take
us
seriously
it
easy
to
get
a
kid
excited
but
when
a
grownup
chimes
in
you
know
there
some
there
there
suzanne
recovered
herself
after
a
second
and
put
away
her
notepad
i
just
the
person
who
writes
it
all
down
you
people
are
making
it
happen
in
ten
years
time
they
remember
you
and
not
us
tjan
said
you
should
get
kettlewell
to
put
you
on
the
payroll
kettlewell
himself
turned
up
the
next
day
suzanne
had
developed
an
intuitive
sense
of
the
from
the
west
coast
and
so
for
a
second
she
could
figure
out
how
he
could
possibly
be
standing
there
nothing
in
the
sky
could
get
him
from
san
jose
to
miami
for
a
seven
am
arrival
private
jet
he
said
and
had
the
grace
to
look
slightly
embarrassed
kodak
had
eight
of
them
and
duracell
had
five
been
trying
to
sell
them
all
off
but
no
one
wants
a
used
jet
these
days
not
even
saudi
princes
or
columbian
so
basically
it
was
going
to
waste
he
smiled
and
looked
eighteen
she
really
did
feel
like
the
only
grownup
sometimes
and
said
zackly
it
practically
environmental
where
tjan
downstairs
saying
goodbye
to
the
guys
i
think
ok
he
said
are
you
coming
she
grabbed
her
notebook
and
a
pen
and
beat
him
out
the
door
of
her
rented
condo
what
this
all
about
tjan
said
looking
wary
the
guys
were
and
curious
looking
slightly
in
awe
of
kettlewell
who
did
little
to
put
them
at
their
ease
he
was
staring
intensely
at
tjan
exit
interview
he
said
company
policy
tjan
rolled
his
eyes
come
on
he
said
i
got
a
flight
to
catch
in
an
hour
i
could
give
you
a
lift
kettlewell
said
you
want
to
do
the
exit
interview
between
here
and
the
airport
i
could
give
you
a
lift
to
jfk
i
got
the
jet
warmed
up
and
waiting
sometimes
suzanne
managed
to
forget
that
kodacell
was
a
dollar
operation
and
that
kettlewell
was
at
its
helm
but
other
times
the
point
was
very
clear
come
on
he
said
we
make
a
day
of
it
we
can
stop
on
the
way
and
pick
up
some
barbecue
to
eat
on
the
plane
i
even
let
you
keep
your
seat
in
the
reclining
position
during
and
landing
hell
you
can
turn
your
on
just
do
tell
the
transport
security
administration
tjan
looked
cornered
then
resigned
sounds
good
to
me
he
said
and
kettlewell
shouldered
one
of
the
two
huge
that
were
sitting
by
the
door
hi
kettlewell
perry
said
kettlewell
set
down
the
duffel
sorry
sorry
lester
perry
really
good
to
see
you
i
bring
suzanne
back
tonight
and
we
all
go
out
for
dinner
ok
suzanne
blinked
i
coming
along
i
sure
hope
so
kettlewell
said
perry
and
lester
accompanied
them
down
in
the
elevator
private
jet
huh
perry
said
never
been
in
one
of
those
kettlewell
told
them
about
his
adventures
trying
to
sell
off
kodacell
private
air
force
send
one
of
them
our
way
then
lester
said
do
you
fly
kettlewell
said
no
perry
said
lester
wants
to
take
it
apart
right
les
lester
nodded
lots
of
cool
junk
in
a
private
jet
these
things
are
worth
millions
guys
kettlewell
said
no
someone
millions
for
them
perry
said
they
whatever
you
can
sell
them
for
kettlewell
laughed
you
had
an
influence
around
here
tjan
he
said
tjan
managed
a
small
tight
smile
kettlewell
had
a
driver
waiting
outside
of
the
building
who
loaded
the
duffels
into
the
spacious
trunk
of
a
spotless
dark
whose
doors
chunked
shut
with
an
expensive
sound
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
really
not
angry
at
all
ok
kettlewell
said
tjan
nodded
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
was
steeling
himself
for
a
turn
in
an
interrogation
chamber
he
barely
said
a
word
since
kettlewell
arrived
for
his
part
kettlewell
appeared
oblivious
to
all
of
this
though
suzanne
was
pretty
sure
that
he
understood
exactly
how
uncomfortable
this
was
making
tjan
the
thing
is
six
months
ago
nearly
everyone
was
convinced
that
i
was
a
fucking
moron
that
i
was
about
to
piss
away
ten
billion
dollars
of
other
people
money
on
a
stupid
doomed
idea
now
they
copying
me
and
poaching
my
best
people
so
this
is
good
news
for
me
though
i
going
to
have
to
find
a
new
business
manager
for
those
two
before
they
get
picked
up
for
turning
planes
into
component
pieces
suzanne
pda
vibrated
whenever
the
number
of
online
news
stories
mentioning
her
or
kodacell
or
kettlewell
increased
or
decreased
sharply
she
used
to
try
to
read
everything
but
it
was
impossible
to
keep
up
now
all
she
wanted
was
to
keep
track
of
whether
the
was
on
the
uptick
or
downtick
it
had
started
to
buzz
that
morning
and
the
pitch
had
increased
steadily
until
it
was
actually
uncomfortable
in
her
pocket
irritated
she
yanked
it
out
and
was
about
to
switch
it
off
when
the
lead
article
caught
her
eye
kodacell
loses
tjan
to
westinghouse
the
was
freddy
feeling
like
a
character
in
a
horror
movie
who
ca
resist
the
compulsion
to
look
under
the
bed
suzanne
thumbed
the
pda
wheel
and
brought
up
the
whole
article
kodacell
tjan
lee
tang
whose
adventures
we
followed
through
suzanne
church
gushing
besotted
blog
posts
she
looked
away
and
reflexively
reached
toward
the
delete
button
the
innuendo
that
she
was
romantically
involved
with
one
or
more
of
the
guys
had
circulated
on
her
blog
message
boards
and
around
the
diggdots
ever
since
she
started
writing
about
them
no
woman
could
possibly
be
writing
about
this
stuff
because
it
was
important
she
had
to
be
with
the
band
a
groupie
or
a
whore
combine
that
with
freddy
sneering
tone
and
she
was
instantly
sent
into
rage
she
deleted
the
post
and
looked
out
the
window
her
pager
buzzed
some
more
and
she
looked
down
the
same
article
being
picked
up
on
blogs
on
some
of
the
bigger
diggdots
and
an
ap
wire
she
forced
herself
to
it
has
been
hired
to
head
up
a
new
business
unit
on
behalf
of
the
multinational
giant
westinghouse
the
appointment
stands
as
more
proof
of
church
power
to
cloud
men
minds
with
pretty
empty
words
about
the
schemes
that
have
oozed
out
of
silicon
valley
and
into
every
empty
and
dead
american
suburb
it
was
hypnotic
like
staring
into
the
eyes
of
a
serpent
her
pulse
actually
thudded
in
her
ears
for
a
second
before
she
took
a
few
deep
breaths
and
calmed
down
enough
to
finish
the
article
which
was
just
more
of
the
same
nasty
personal
attacks
sniping
and
innuendo
freddy
even
managed
to
imply
that
she
was
screwing
all
of
them
and
kettlewell
besides
kettlewell
leaned
over
her
shoulder
and
read
you
should
send
him
an
email
he
said
that
disgusting
not
reportage
never
get
into
a
pissing
match
with
a
skunk
she
said
what
freddy
wants
is
for
me
to
send
him
mail
that
he
can
publish
along
with
more
snarky
commentary
when
the
guy
you
arguing
with
controls
the
venue
you
arguing
in
you
ca
possibly
win
so
blog
him
kettlewell
said
correct
the
record
the
record
is
correct
she
said
it
never
been
incorrect
written
an
exhaustive
record
that
is
there
for
everyone
to
see
if
people
believe
this
no
amount
of
correction
will
help
kettlewell
made
a
face
like
a
little
boy
who
been
told
he
have
a
toy
that
guy
is
poison
he
said
those
around
blog
let
him
add
his
she
said
my
daily
readership
is
higher
than
the
merc
paid
circulation
this
week
it
was
true
after
a
short
uphill
climb
from
her
new
url
she
accumulated
enough
readers
that
the
advertising
revenue
dwarfed
her
old
salary
at
the
merc
an
astonishing
happenstance
that
nevertheless
kept
her
full
she
clicked
a
little
besides
look
at
this
there
are
three
dozen
links
pointing
at
this
story
so
far
and
all
of
them
are
critical
of
him
we
do
need
to
stick
up
for
ourselves
the
world
will
saying
it
calmed
her
and
now
they
were
at
the
airport
they
cruised
into
a
private
gate
away
from
the
militarized
gulag
that
fronted
miami
international
a
courteous
security
guard
waved
them
through
and
the
driver
confidently
piloted
the
car
up
to
a
wheeled
jetway
beside
a
cute
stubby
little
toy
jet
on
the
side
in
cursive
script
was
the
plane
name
suzanne
she
looked
accusatorially
at
kettlewell
it
was
called
that
when
i
bought
the
company
he
said
expressionless
but
somehow
mirthful
behind
his
curved
surfer
shades
but
i
kept
it
because
i
liked
the
private
joke
just
no
one
tell
freddy
that
you
got
an
airplane
with
my
name
on
it
or
we
never
hear
the
fucking
end
of
it
she
covered
her
mouth
regretting
her
language
and
kettlewell
laughed
and
so
did
tjan
and
somehow
the
ice
was
broken
between
them
no
flying
this
thing
is
tjan
said
your
cfo
should
be
kicking
your
ass
it
a
little
indulgence
kettlewell
said
bounding
up
the
steps
and
shaking
hands
with
a
small
neat
woman
pilot
an
with
peeking
out
under
her
smart
peaked
cap
once
you
flown
in
your
own
bird
you
never
go
back
this
is
a
tjan
said
as
he
boarded
what
this
thing
eats
up
in
hangar
fees
alone
would
be
enough
to
bankroll
three
or
four
teams
he
settled
into
an
oversized
barcalounger
of
a
seat
and
accepted
a
glass
of
orange
juice
that
the
pilot
poured
for
him
thank
you
and
no
offense
none
taken
she
said
i
agree
one
hundred
percent
see
tjan
said
suzanne
took
her
own
seat
and
her
own
glass
and
buckled
in
and
watched
the
two
of
them
warming
up
for
the
main
event
realizing
that
been
brought
along
as
a
kind
of
opening
act
they
paying
you
more
yup
tjan
said
all
on
the
half
a
point
on
every
dollar
brought
in
by
a
team
i
coach
or
whose
members
i
mentor
kettlewell
whistled
that
a
big
share
he
said
if
i
can
make
my
numbers
i
take
home
a
million
this
year
you
make
those
numbers
good
negotiations
why
did
you
ask
us
for
the
same
deal
would
you
have
given
it
to
me
you
a
star
kettlewell
said
nodding
at
suzanne
whose
invisibility
to
the
conversation
popped
like
a
bubble
thanks
to
her
thanks
suzanne
tjan
said
suzanne
blushed
come
on
guys
tjan
shook
his
head
she
does
really
understand
it
actually
kind
of
charming
we
might
have
matched
the
offer
you
guys
are
first
to
market
you
got
a
lot
of
procedures
in
place
i
wanted
to
reinvent
some
wheels
we
too
for
you
tjan
grinned
wickedly
oh
yes
he
said
i
going
to
do
business
in
kettlewell
grunted
and
pounded
his
orange
juice
around
them
the
jet
windows
flashed
white
as
they
broke
through
the
clouds
and
the
ten
thousand
foot
bell
sounded
how
the
hell
are
you
going
to
make
anything
that
does
collapse
under
its
own
weight
in
russia
the
corruption
a
problem
sure
tjan
said
but
it
offset
by
the
entrepreneurship
some
of
those
cats
make
the
chinese
look
lazy
and
unimaginative
it
a
shame
that
so
much
of
their
efforts
have
been
centered
on
graft
but
there
no
reason
they
could
be
focused
on
making
an
honest
ruble
they
fell
into
a
discussion
of
the
minutiae
of
perry
and
businesses
franker
than
any
business
discussion
she
ever
heard
tjan
talked
about
the
places
where
they
screwed
up
and
places
where
they
scored
big
and
about
all
the
plans
he
made
for
westinghouse
the
connections
he
had
in
russia
he
even
talked
about
his
kids
and
his
ex
in
st
petersburg
and
kettlewell
admitted
that
he
known
about
them
already
for
kettlewell
part
he
opened
the
proverbial
kimono
wide
telling
tjan
about
conflicts
within
the
board
of
directors
poisonous
holdovers
from
the
days
who
sabotaged
the
company
from
within
with
petty
bureaucracy
even
the
problems
he
was
having
with
his
family
over
the
long
hours
they
were
working
he
opened
the
minibar
and
cracked
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
toast
tjan
new
job
and
they
mixed
it
with
more
orange
juice
and
then
there
were
bagels
and
schmear
fresh
fruit
power
bars
and
canned
starbucks
coffees
with
deadly
amounts
of
sugar
and
caffeine
when
kettlewell
disappeared
into
the
tiny
but
bathroom
suzanne
found
herself
sitting
alone
with
tjan
almost
knee
to
knee
lightheaded
from
lack
of
sleep
and
champagne
and
altitude
some
trip
she
said
you
the
best
he
said
wobbling
a
little
you
know
that
just
the
best
the
stuff
you
write
about
these
guys
it
makes
me
want
to
stand
up
and
salute
you
make
us
all
seem
so
fucking
going
to
end
up
taking
over
the
world
because
you
inspire
us
so
maybe
i
should
tell
you
this
because
you
not
very
about
it
right
now
but
suzanne
you
wo
believe
it
because
so
goddamned
modest
too
it
what
makes
your
writing
so
right
so
believable
kettlewell
stepped
out
of
the
bathroom
touching
down
soon
he
said
and
patted
them
each
on
the
shoulder
as
he
took
his
seat
so
about
it
then
he
said
and
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
suzanne
was
accustomed
to
thinking
of
him
as
the
boyish
age
of
the
magazine
cover
portraits
from
the
start
of
his
career
now
eyes
closed
on
his
private
jet
harsh
upper
atmosphere
sun
painting
his
face
his
crowsfeet
and
the
deep
vertical
brackets
around
his
mouth
revealed
him
for
someone
pushing
a
youthful
forty
kept
young
by
exercise
and
fun
and
the
animation
of
his
ideas
guess
so
tjan
said
slumping
this
has
been
one
of
the
more
memorable
experiences
of
my
life
kettlewell
suzanne
not
entirely
pleasant
but
pleasant
on
the
whole
a
magical
time
in
the
clouds
once
you
flown
private
you
never
go
back
to
coach
kettlewell
said
smiling
eyes
still
closed
you
still
think
my
cfo
should
spank
me
for
not
selling
this
thing
no
tjan
said
in
ten
years
if
we
do
our
jobs
there
wo
be
five
companies
on
earth
that
can
afford
this
kind
of
thing
it
be
like
building
a
cathedral
after
the
protestant
reformation
while
we
have
the
chance
we
should
keep
these
things
in
the
sky
but
you
should
give
one
to
lester
and
perry
to
take
apart
i
was
planning
to
kettlewell
said
thanks
suzanne
and
kettlewell
got
off
the
plane
and
tjan
did
look
back
when
they
landed
at
jfk
should
we
go
into
town
and
get
some
bialy
to
bring
back
to
miami
kettlewell
said
squinting
at
the
bright
day
on
the
tarmac
bring
deli
to
miami
right
right
he
said
forget
i
asked
besides
we
have
to
charter
a
chopper
to
get
into
manhattan
and
back
without
dying
in
traffic
something
about
the
light
through
the
open
hatch
or
the
sound
or
the
smell
something
indefinably
new
york
made
her
yearn
for
miami
the
great
cities
of
commerce
like
new
york
and
san
francisco
seemed
too
real
for
her
while
the
suburbs
of
florida
were
a
kind
of
endless
summer
camp
a
dreamtime
where
anything
was
possible
let
go
she
said
the
champagne
buzz
had
crashed
and
she
had
a
touch
of
headache
i
bushed
me
too
kettlewell
said
i
left
san
jose
last
night
to
get
into
miami
before
tjan
left
not
much
sleep
gon
na
put
my
seat
back
and
catch
some
winks
if
that
ok
good
plan
suzanne
said
embarrassingly
when
they
were
fully
reclined
their
seats
nearly
touched
forming
something
like
a
double
bed
suzanne
lay
awake
in
the
hum
of
the
jets
for
a
while
conscious
of
the
breathing
human
beside
her
the
first
man
she
done
anything
like
share
a
bed
with
in
at
least
a
year
the
last
thing
she
remembered
was
the
ten
thousand
foot
bell
going
off
and
then
she
slipped
away
into
sleep
perry
thought
that
they
sell
a
million
home
awares
in
six
months
lester
thought
he
was
nuts
that
number
was
too
high
please
he
said
i
these
things
but
there
are
a
million
roommate
households
in
all
of
america
we
sell
half
a
million
tops
total
lester
always
complained
when
she
quoted
him
directly
in
her
blog
posts
but
she
thought
he
secretly
enjoyed
it
today
the
boys
shipped
their
millionth
unit
it
took
six
weeks
they
uncorked
a
bottle
of
champagne
when
unit
one
million
shipped
they
had
actually
shipped
it
per
se
the
manufacturing
was
spread
out
across
forty
different
teams
all
across
the
country
even
a
couple
of
canadian
teams
the
rfid
printer
company
had
half
the
workers
they
laid
off
the
year
before
and
had
them
all
working
overtime
to
meet
demand
what
exciting
about
this
is
just
the
money
that
these
guys
have
made
off
of
it
or
the
money
that
kodacell
will
return
to
its
shareholders
it
the
ecosystem
that
these
things
have
enabled
there
at
least
ten
competing
commercial
systems
for
organizing
tagging
sharing
and
describing
home
aware
objects
parents
love
them
for
their
kids
school
teachers
love
them
seniors
homes
the
seniors
homes
had
been
francis
idea
they
brought
him
in
to
oversee
some
of
the
production
engineering
along
with
some
of
the
young
braves
who
ran
around
the
squatter
camps
francis
knew
which
ones
were
biddable
and
he
kept
them
to
heel
in
the
evenings
join
the
guys
and
suzanne
up
on
the
roof
of
the
workshop
on
folding
chairs
with
beers
watching
the
sweaty
sunset
they
not
the
sole
supplier
that
what
an
ecosystem
is
all
about
creating
value
for
a
lot
of
players
all
this
competition
is
great
news
for
you
and
me
because
it
already
driven
the
price
of
home
aware
goods
down
by
forty
percent
that
means
that
lester
and
perry
are
going
to
have
to
invent
something
new
soon
before
the
margin
disappears
altogether
and
that
also
good
news
for
you
and
me
are
you
coming
lester
had
dated
a
girl
for
a
while
someone
he
met
on
craigslist
but
she
dumped
him
and
perry
had
confided
that
left
him
because
he
did
live
up
to
the
press
he
gotten
in
suzanne
column
when
he
got
dumped
he
became
even
touchier
about
suzanne
caught
at
a
distance
from
her
that
was
defined
by
equal
parts
of
desire
and
resentment
up
in
a
minute
she
said
trying
to
keep
her
smile
light
and
noncommittal
lester
was
very
nice
but
there
were
times
when
she
caught
him
staring
at
her
like
a
kicked
puppy
and
it
made
her
uncomfortable
naturally
this
increased
his
discomfort
as
well
on
the
roof
they
already
had
a
cooler
of
beers
going
and
beside
it
a
huge
plastic
tub
of
brightly
colored
jet
engine
perry
said
the
months
had
put
a
couple
pounds
on
him
and
new
wrinkles
and
given
him
some
grey
at
the
temples
and
laugh
lines
inside
his
laugh
lines
perry
was
always
laughing
at
everything
around
them
they
fucking
to
do
this
he
told
her
once
before
literally
collapsing
to
the
floor
rolling
with
uncontrollable
hysteria
he
laughed
again
good
old
kettlebelly
she
said
must
have
broken
his
heart
francis
held
up
a
curved
piece
of
cowling
this
thing
was
going
to
last
anyway
see
the
distortion
here
and
here
this
thing
was
designed
in
a
virtual
and
we
tried
that
a
couple
times
but
the
sims
were
never
detailed
enough
and
the
forms
that
flew
well
in
the
machine
always
died
a
premature
death
in
the
sky
another
two
years
and
he
have
had
to
have
it
rebuilt
anyway
and
the
koreans
who
built
this
charge
shitloads
for
parts
too
bad
lester
said
it
pretty
gorgeous
even
he
mimed
its
curve
in
the
air
with
a
pudgy
hand
that
elegant
swoop
aerospace
loves
the
virtual
francis
said
and
glared
at
the
cowling
you
can
use
evolutionary
algorithms
in
the
sim
and
come
up
with
really
efficient
designs
in
theory
and
computers
are
cheaper
than
engineers
is
that
why
you
were
laid
off
suzanne
said
i
was
laid
off
girl
he
said
he
jiggled
his
lame
foot
i
retired
at
and
was
all
set
up
but
the
pension
plan
went
bust
so
i
missed
a
month
of
medical
and
they
cut
me
off
and
i
ended
up
uninsured
when
the
wife
took
sick
bam
that
was
it
wiped
right
out
but
i
not
bitter
why
should
the
poor
be
allowed
to
live
huh
his
acolytes
three
teenagers
in
from
the
shantytown
laughed
and
went
on
to
pitching
off
the
edge
of
the
roof
stop
that
now
he
said
you
getting
the
junkyard
all
dirty
christ
you
think
that
they
grew
up
in
some
kind
of
zoo
when
francis
drank
he
got
a
little
mean
a
little
dark
so
kids
perry
said
wandering
over
to
them
hands
in
pockets
silhouetted
against
the
setting
sun
biceps
bulging
muscular
chest
tapering
to
his
narrow
hips
he
looked
like
a
greek
statue
what
do
you
think
of
the
stuff
we
building
they
looked
at
their
toes
ok
one
of
them
grunted
answer
the
man
francis
snapped
complete
sentences
looking
up
and
at
him
like
you
got
a
shred
of
christ
what
are
you
five
years
old
they
shifted
uncomfortably
it
fine
one
of
them
said
would
you
use
it
at
home
one
of
them
snorted
no
man
my
dad
steals
anything
nice
we
get
and
sells
it
oh
perry
said
fucker
broke
in
the
other
night
and
i
caught
him
with
my
ipod
nearly
took
his
fucking
head
off
with
my
cannon
before
i
saw
who
it
was
fucking
you
should
have
fucked
him
up
one
of
the
other
kids
said
my
ma
pushed
my
pops
in
front
of
a
bus
one
day
to
get
rid
of
him
guy
broke
both
his
legs
and
never
came
back
suzanne
knew
it
was
meant
to
shock
them
but
that
did
take
away
from
its
shockingness
in
the
warm
fog
of
writing
and
living
in
florida
it
was
easy
to
forget
that
these
people
lived
in
a
squatter
camp
and
were
technically
criminals
and
received
no
protection
from
the
law
perry
though
just
squinted
into
the
sun
and
nodded
have
you
ever
tried
burglar
alarms
the
kids
laughed
derisively
and
suzanne
winced
but
perry
was
undaunted
you
could
be
sure
that
you
woke
up
whenever
anyone
entered
set
up
a
light
and
siren
to
scare
them
off
i
want
one
that
fires
spears
the
one
with
the
father
said
blowtorches
said
the
one
whose
mother
pushed
his
father
under
a
bus
i
want
a
the
third
one
said
speaking
for
the
first
time
i
want
something
that
will
keep
anyone
from
coming
in
period
so
i
do
have
to
sleep
one
eye
up
i
be
safe
the
other
two
nodded
slowly
damn
straight
francis
said
that
was
the
last
time
francis
acolytes
joined
them
on
the
rooftop
instead
when
they
finished
work
they
went
home
walking
slowly
and
talking
in
low
murmurs
with
just
the
grownups
on
the
roof
it
was
a
lot
more
subdued
what
that
smoke
lester
said
pointing
at
the
black
billowing
column
off
to
the
west
in
the
sunset
glare
francis
said
has
to
be
or
a
big
fucking
maybe
perry
ran
down
the
stairs
and
came
back
up
with
a
pair
of
binox
francis
that
your
place
he
said
after
a
fiddling
he
handed
the
binox
to
francis
just
hit
the
button
and
they
that
my
place
francis
said
oh
christ
he
gone
gray
and
seemed
to
have
sobered
up
instantly
his
lips
were
wet
his
eyes
bright
they
drove
over
at
speed
suzanne
wedged
into
frankensmartcar
practically
under
his
armpit
and
perry
traveling
with
francis
lester
still
wore
the
same
cologne
as
her
father
and
when
she
opened
the
window
its
smell
was
replaced
by
the
smell
of
the
fire
they
arrived
to
discover
a
parked
on
the
side
of
the
freeway
nearest
the
shantytown
the
were
standing
soberly
beside
it
watching
the
fire
rage
across
the
canal
they
rushed
for
the
footbridge
and
a
firefighter
blocked
their
way
sorry
it
not
safe
he
said
he
was
latino
good
looking
like
a
movie
star
bronze
skin
flickering
with
copper
highlights
from
the
fire
i
live
there
francis
said
that
my
home
the
firefighter
looked
away
it
not
safe
he
said
why
are
you
fighting
the
fire
suzanne
said
francis
head
snapped
around
you
not
fighting
the
fire
going
to
let
our
houses
burn
a
couple
more
trickled
over
across
the
river
the
fire
had
consumed
half
of
the
little
settlement
some
of
the
residents
were
operating
a
slow
and
ponderous
from
the
canal
while
others
ran
into
the
unburned
buildings
and
emerged
clutching
armloads
of
belongings
bits
of
furniture
boxes
of
photos
sir
the
said
the
owner
of
this
property
has
asked
us
not
to
intervene
since
there
no
imminent
risk
to
life
and
no
risk
of
the
burn
spreading
off
his
property
we
ca
trespass
to
put
out
the
fire
our
hands
are
tied
the
owner
francis
spat
this
land
is
in
title
dispute
the
court
case
has
been
underway
for
twenty
years
now
what
owner
the
shrugged
that
all
i
know
sir
across
the
canal
the
fire
was
spreading
and
the
bucket
brigade
was
falling
back
suzanne
could
feel
the
heat
now
like
putting
your
face
in
the
steam
from
a
boiling
kettle
francis
seethed
looking
from
the
firemen
and
their
truck
back
to
the
fire
he
looked
like
he
was
going
to
pop
something
or
start
shouting
or
charge
into
the
flames
suzanne
grabbed
his
hand
and
walked
him
over
to
the
truck
and
grabbed
the
first
firefighter
she
encountered
i
suzanne
church
from
the
san
jose
mercury
news
a
mcclatchy
paper
i
like
to
speak
to
the
commanding
officer
on
the
scene
please
she
had
been
with
the
merc
for
months
but
she
had
been
able
to
bring
herself
to
say
suzanne
church
with
she
was
pretty
sure
that
no
matter
how
high
her
readership
was
and
how
profitable
her
ad
sales
were
the
would
have
been
galvanized
into
the
action
that
was
invoked
when
she
mentioned
the
name
of
a
real
newspaper
he
hopped
to
quickly
moving
to
an
older
man
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
whispering
in
his
ear
suzanne
squeezed
francis
hand
as
the
approached
them
she
extended
her
hand
and
talked
fast
suzanne
church
she
said
and
took
out
her
notebook
the
key
prop
in
any
set
piece
involving
a
reporter
i
told
that
you
are
going
to
let
those
homes
burn
because
someone
representing
himself
as
the
to
that
property
has
denied
you
entry
however
also
told
that
the
title
to
that
land
is
in
dispute
and
has
been
in
the
courts
for
decades
can
you
resolve
this
for
me
chief
chief
brian
wannamaker
he
said
he
was
her
age
with
the
leathery
skin
of
a
florida
native
who
spent
a
lot
of
time
out
of
doors
afraid
i
have
no
comment
for
you
at
this
time
suzanne
kept
her
face
deadpan
and
gave
francis
hand
a
warning
squeeze
to
keep
him
quiet
he
was
trembling
now
i
see
you
comment
you
ca
fight
the
fire
is
that
what
you
like
me
to
write
in
tomorrow
paper
the
chief
looked
at
the
fire
for
a
moment
across
the
canal
the
were
losing
worse
than
ever
he
frowned
and
suzanne
saw
that
his
hands
were
clenched
into
fists
let
me
make
a
call
ok
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
stepped
behind
the
reaching
for
his
cellphone
suzanne
strained
to
hear
his
conversation
but
it
was
inaudible
over
the
crackle
of
the
fire
when
she
turned
around
again
francis
was
gone
she
caught
sight
of
him
again
in
just
a
moment
running
for
the
canal
then
jumping
in
and
landing
badly
in
the
shallow
swampy
water
he
hobbled
across
to
the
opposite
bank
and
began
to
laboriously
climb
it
a
second
later
perry
followed
then
lester
chief
she
said
going
around
the
engine
and
pointing
the
chief
had
the
phone
clamped
to
his
head
still
but
when
he
saw
what
was
going
on
he
snapped
it
shut
dropped
it
in
his
pocket
and
started
barking
orders
now
the
boiling
across
the
bridge
uncoiling
hoses
strapping
on
tanks
and
masks
they
worked
in
easy
fluid
concert
and
it
was
only
seconds
before
the
water
and
foam
hit
the
flames
and
the
smoke
changed
to
white
steam
the
shantytown
residents
cheered
the
fire
slowly
receded
perry
and
lester
had
francis
holding
him
back
from
charging
into
the
fray
as
the
executed
their
clockwork
dance
the
steam
was
hot
enough
to
scald
and
suzanne
pulled
the
collar
of
her
blouse
up
over
her
face
around
her
were
the
shantytowners
mothers
with
small
children
old
men
and
a
seemingly
endless
parade
of
teenagers
the
boys
in
miniature
cycling
shorts
and
the
girls
in
bandeau
tops
glitter
makeup
and
skirts
made
from
overlapping
strips
of
rag
like
hula
outfits
their
faces
were
tight
angry
smudged
with
smoke
and
pinkened
by
the
heat
she
saw
the
one
whose
father
had
reportedly
been
pushed
under
a
bus
by
his
mother
and
he
grimaced
at
her
what
we
gon
na
do
now
i
do
know
she
said
are
you
all
right
is
your
family
all
right
do
got
nowhere
to
sleep
nowhere
to
go
he
said
do
even
have
a
change
of
clothes
my
moms
wo
stop
crying
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
he
was
all
of
fifteen
she
realized
he
seemed
much
older
on
the
roof
she
gathered
him
into
her
arms
and
gave
him
a
hug
he
was
stiff
and
awkward
at
first
and
then
he
kind
of
melted
into
her
weeping
on
her
shoulder
she
stroked
his
back
and
murmured
reassuringly
some
of
the
other
shantytowners
looked
at
the
spectacle
then
looked
away
even
a
couple
of
his
homeboys
whom
she
have
bet
would
have
laughed
and
pointed
at
this
show
of
weakness
only
looked
and
then
passed
on
one
had
tears
streaking
the
smoke
smudges
on
his
face
someone
who
is
good
at
comforting
people
i
seem
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
she
thought
francis
and
lester
and
perry
found
her
and
francis
gave
the
boy
a
gruff
hug
and
told
him
everything
would
be
fine
the
fire
was
out
now
the
firefighter
hosing
down
the
last
embers
going
through
the
crowd
and
checking
for
injuries
a
tv
news
crew
had
set
up
and
a
pretty
black
reporter
in
her
twenties
was
doing
a
stand
up
the
illegal
squatter
community
has
long
been
identified
as
a
problem
area
for
gang
and
drug
activity
by
the
broward
county
office
the
destruction
here
seems
total
but
it
impossible
to
say
whether
this
spells
the
end
of
this
encampment
or
whether
the
denizens
will
rebuild
and
stay
on
suzanne
burned
with
shame
that
could
have
been
her
when
she
first
seen
this
place
it
had
been
like
something
out
of
a
documentary
on
ethiopia
as
she
come
to
know
it
it
had
grown
homier
the
residents
built
piecemeal
one
wall
at
a
time
one
window
one
poured
concrete
floor
as
they
could
afford
it
none
of
them
had
mortgages
but
they
had
neat
vegetable
gardens
and
walkways
spelled
out
in
white
stones
with
garden
gnomes
standing
guard
the
reporter
was
staring
at
her
and
naturally
so
she
been
staring
at
the
reporter
glaring
at
her
my
rv
francis
said
pointing
distracting
her
it
was
a
charred
wreck
he
went
to
the
melted
doors
and
opened
them
stepping
back
as
a
puff
of
smoke
rose
from
the
inside
a
spotted
it
and
diverted
a
stream
of
water
into
the
interior
soaking
francis
and
whatever
had
burned
he
turned
and
shouted
something
at
the
but
he
was
already
hosing
down
something
else
inside
francis
trailer
they
salvaged
a
drenched
a
few
tools
and
a
with
some
of
his
papers
in
it
he
had
backed
up
his
laptop
to
his
watch
that
morning
so
his
data
was
safe
i
kept
meaning
to
scan
these
in
he
said
paging
through
the
photos
in
the
soaked
album
should
have
done
it
night
was
falling
the
mosquitoes
singing
and
buzzing
the
neat
little
laneways
and
homey
patchwork
buildings
lay
in
ruins
around
them
the
shantytowners
clustered
in
little
groups
or
picked
through
the
ruins
drivers
of
passing
cars
slowed
down
to
rubberneck
and
a
few
shouted
filthy
vengeful
things
at
them
suzanne
took
pictures
of
their
license
plates
she
publish
them
when
she
got
home
a
light
drizzle
fell
children
cried
the
swampy
sounds
of
cicadas
and
frogs
and
mosquitoes
filled
the
growing
dark
and
then
the
streetlights
flicked
on
all
down
the
river
of
highway
painting
everything
in
mercury
glow
we
got
to
get
tents
up
francis
said
he
grabbed
a
couple
of
young
men
and
gave
them
orders
things
to
look
for
fresh
water
plastic
sheeting
anything
with
which
to
erect
shelters
lester
started
to
help
them
and
perry
stood
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
next
to
suzanne
jesus
christ
he
said
this
is
a
fucking
disaster
i
mean
these
people
are
used
to
living
rough
but
this
he
broke
off
waving
his
hands
helplessly
he
wiped
his
palms
off
on
his
butt
then
grabbed
francis
get
them
going
he
said
get
them
to
gather
up
their
stuff
and
walk
them
down
to
our
place
we
got
space
for
everyone
for
now
at
least
francis
looked
like
he
was
going
to
say
something
then
he
stopped
he
climbed
precariously
up
on
the
hood
of
lester
car
and
shouted
for
people
to
gather
round
the
boys
he
bossed
around
took
up
the
call
and
it
was
long
before
nearly
everyone
was
gathered
around
them
can
everyone
hear
this
is
as
loud
as
i
go
there
were
murmurs
of
assent
suzanne
had
seen
him
meet
with
his
people
before
in
the
daylight
and
the
good
times
seen
the
respect
they
afforded
to
him
he
was
the
leader
per
se
but
when
he
spoke
people
listened
it
was
a
characteristic
she
encountered
in
the
and
in
technology
in
the
ones
the
others
all
gravitated
to
charismatics
we
got
a
place
to
stay
a
bit
up
the
road
for
tonight
it
about
a
half
hour
walk
it
indoors
and
there
toilets
but
maybe
not
much
to
make
beds
out
of
take
what
you
can
carry
for
about
a
mile
you
can
come
back
tomorrow
for
the
rest
you
do
have
to
come
but
this
is
going
to
be
any
fun
tonight
a
woman
came
forward
she
was
young
but
not
young
enough
to
be
a
homegirl
she
had
long
dark
hair
and
she
twisted
her
hands
as
she
spoke
in
a
soft
voice
to
francis
what
about
our
stuff
we
leave
it
here
tonight
it
all
we
got
francis
nodded
we
need
ten
people
to
stand
guard
in
two
shifts
of
five
tonight
young
people

flashlights
and
phones
coffee
and
whatever
else
we
can
give

the
rubberneckers

rubberneckers
were
out
of
earshot
the
account
they
get
of
this
would
come
from
the
who
tell
them
how
dangerous
and
dirty
this
place
was
they
never
see
what
suzanne
saw
ten
men
and
women
forming
up
to
one
side
of
the
crowd
young
braves
and
homegirls
people
her
age
their
faces
solemn
francis
oversaw
the
gathering
up
of
belongings
suzanne
had
never
had
a
sense
of
how
many
people
lived
in
the
shantytown
but
now
she
could
count
them
as
they
massed
up
by
the
roadside
and
began
to
walk
a
hundred
a
little
more
than
a
hundred
more
if
you
counted
the
surprising
number
of
babies
lester
conferred
briefly
with
francis
and
then
francis
tapped
three
of
the
old
timers
and
two
of
the
mothers
with
babes
in
arms
and
they
crammed
into
lester
car
and
he
took
off
suzanne
walked
by
the
roadside
with
the
long
line
of
refugees
listening
to
their
murmuring
conversation
and
in
a
few
minutes
lester
was
back
to
pick
up
more
people
at
francis
discretion
perry
was
beside
her
now
his
eyes
a
million
miles
away
what
now
she
said
we
put
them
in
the
workshop
tonight
tomorrow
we
help
them
build
houses
at
your
place
you
going
to
let
them
stay
why
not
we
do
use
half
of
that
land
the
landlord
gets
his
check
every
month
has
been
by
in
five
years
he
wo
care
she
took
a
couple
more
steps
perry
i
going
to
write
about
this
she
said
oh
he
said
they
walked
further
a
small
child
was
crying
of
course
you
are
well
fuck
the
landlord
i
sic
kettlewell
on
him
if
he
squawks
what
do
you
think
kettlewell
will
think
about
all
this
this
look
this
is
what
i
been
saying
all
along
we
need
to
make
products
for
these
people
they
a
huge
untapped
market
what
she
wanted
to
ask
was
would
tjan
say
about
this
but
they
did
talk
about
tjan
these
days
kettlewell
had
promised
them
a
new
business
manager
for
weeks
but
none
had
appeared
perry
had
taken
over
more
and
more
of
the
managerial
roles
and
was
getting
less
and
less
workshop
time
in
she
could
tell
it
frustrated
him
in
her
discussions
with
kettlewell
he
confided
that
it
had
turned
out
to
be
harder
to
find
suits
than
it
was
finding
wildly
inventive
nerds
lots
of
people
to
run
businesses
but
the
number
who
actually
seemed
likely
to
be
capable
of
doing
so
was
only
a
small
fraction
they
could
see
the
junkyard
now
perry
pulled
out
his
phone
and
called
his
server
and
the
codes
to
turn
on
all
the
lights
and
unlock
all
the
doors
they
lost
a
couple
of
kids
in
the
aisles
of
miraculous
junk
and
francis
had
to
send
out
bigger
kids
to
find
them
and
bring
them
back
holding
the
treasures
they
found
to
their
chests
lester
kept
going
back
for
more
more
mothers
more
stragglers
operating
his
ferry
service
until
they
were
all
indoors
in
the
workshop
this
is
the
place
francis
said
we
stay
indoors
here
tonight
toilets
are
there
and
there
orderly
lines
no
shoving
what
about
food
asked
a
man
with
a
small
boy
sleeping
over
his
shoulder
this
is
the
red
cross
al
francis
snapped
we
organize
food
for
ourselves
in
the
morning
perry
whispered
in
his
ear
francis
shook
his
head
and
perry
whispered
some
more
there
will
be
food
in
the
morning
this
is
perry
it
his
place
he
going
to
go
to
costco
for
us
when
they
open
the
crowd
cheered
and
a
few
of
the
women
hugged
him
some
of
the
men
shook
his
hand
perry
blushed
suzanne
smiled
these
people
were
good
people
they
been
through
more
than
suzanne
could
imagine
it
felt
right
that
she
could
help
them
like
making
up
for
every
panhandler
she
ignored
and
every
drunk
she
stepped
over
there
were
no
blankets
there
were
no
beds
the
squatters
slept
on
the
concrete
floor
young
couples
spooned
under
tables
children
snuggled
between
their
parents
or
held
onto
their
mothers
as
the
squatters
dossed
down
and
as
suzanne
walked
past
them
to
get
to
her
car
her
heart
broke
a
hundred
times
she
felt
like
one
of
those
photographers
walking
through
an
okie
camp
a
rending
visual
at
each
corner
back
at
her
rented
condo
she
found
herself
at
the
foot
of
her
comfortable
bed
with
its
thick
duvet
she
liked
keeping
the
ac
turned
up
enough
to
snuggle
under
a
blanket
and
the
four
pillows
she
was
in
her
jammies
but
she
could
climb
in
between
those
sheets
she
could
and
then
she
was
back
in
her
car
with
all
her
blankets
sheets
pillows
big
towels
even
the
sofa
cushions
which
the
landlord
was
not
going
to
be
happy
about
and
speeding
back
to
the
workshop
she
let
herself
in
and
set
about
distributing
the
blankets
and
pillows
and
towels
picking
out
the
families
the
old
people
a
woman
apparently
and
young
but
skinny
sat
up
and
said
hey
where
one
for
me
suzanne
recognized
the
voice
the
junkie
from
the
ihop
lester
friend
the
one
who
grabbed
her
and
cursed
her
she
did
want
to
give
the
woman
a
blanket
she
only
had
two
left
and
there
were
old
people
lying
on
the
bare
floor
where
one
for
me
the
woman
said
more
loudly
some
of
the
sleepers
stirred
some
of
them
sat
up
suzanne
was
shaking
who
the
hell
was
she
to
decide
who
got
a
blanket
did
being
rude
to
her
at
the
ihop
disqualify
you
from
getting
bedding
when
your
house
burned
down
suzanne
gave
her
a
blanket
and
she
snatched
one
of
the
sofa
cushions
besides
why
she
still
alive
suzanne
thought
she
survived
she
gave
away
the
last
blanket
and
went
home
to
sleep
on
her
naked
bed
underneath
an
old
coat
a
sweater
for
a
pillow
after
her
shower
she
dried
herself
on
having
given
away
all
her
towels
to
use
as
bedding
the
new
shantytown
went
up
fast
faster
than
she
dreamed
possible
the
boys
helped
lester
downloaded
all
the
information
he
could
find
on
temporary
shelters
building
out
of
mud
out
of
sandbags
out
of
corrugated
cardboard
and
sheets
of
plastic
and
they
tried
them
all
some
of
the
houses
had
two
or
more
stories
but
they
all
felt
solid
enough
as
she
toured
them
snapping
photos
of
proud
homesteaders
standing
next
to
their
handiwork
little
things
went
missing
from
the
workshops
tools
easily
pawned
books
and
keepsakes
perry
wallet
and
they
all
started
locking
their
there
were
junkies
in
among
the
squatters
and
desperate
people
and
immoral
people
them
too
one
day
she
found
that
her
cute
little
gold
earrings
were
beside
her
where
she
left
them
the
night
before
and
she
practically
burst
into
tears
feeling
on
all
sides
she
found
the
earrings
later
that
day
at
the
bottom
of
her
purse
and
that
only
made
things
worse
even
though
she
had
voiced
a
single
accusation
she
accused
every
one
of
the
squatters
in
her
mind
that
day
she
found
herself
unable
to
meet
their
eyes
for
the
rest
of
the
week
i
have
to
write
about
this
she
said
to
perry
this
is
part
of
the
story
she
stayed
clear
of
it
for
a
month
but
she
could
go
on
writing
about
the
successes
of
the
home
aware
without
writing
about
the
workforce
that
was
turning
out
the
devices
and
by
the
thousands
all
around
her
in
impromptu
factories
with
impromptu
workers
why
perry
said
he
been
a
dervish
filling
orders
training
people
fighting
fires
by
nightfall
he
was
and
snappish
lester
did
join
them
on
the
roof
anymore
he
liked
to
hang
out
with
francis
and
some
of
the
young
men
and
pitch
horseshoes
down
in
the
shantytown
or
tinker
with
the
composting
toilets
been
installing
at
strategic
crossroads
through
the
town
ca
you
just
concentrate
on
the
business
perry
this
the
business
kettlewell
has
sent
a
replacement
for
tjan
and
you
filled
in
and
you
turned
this
place
into
something
like
a
that
important
news
the
point
of
this
exercise
is
to
try
all
the
different
businesses
that
are
possible
and
see
what
works
if
you
found
something
that
works
i
should
write
about
it
especially
since
it
not
just
solving
kodacell
problem
it
solving
the
problem
for
all
of
those
people
too
perry
drank
his
beer
in
sullen
silence
i
do
want
kettlewell
to
get
more
involved
in
this
it
going
good
scrutiny
could
kill
it
you
got
nothing
to
be
embarrassed
about
here
she
said
nothing
here
that
is
as
it
should
be
perry
looked
at
her
for
a
long
moment
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
fuse
trying
to
do
too
much
and
she
regretted
having
brought
it
up
you
do
what
you
have
to
do
he
said
the
original
shantytown
was
astonishing
built
around
a
nexus
of
trailers
and
rvs
that
did
look
in
the
least
roadworthy
the
settlers
had
added
dwelling
on
dwelling
to
their
little
patch
of
land
they
started
with
plastic
sheeting
and
poles
and
when
they
could
afford
it
they
replaced
the
sheets
one
at
a
time
with
bricks
or
poured
concrete
and
they
thatched
their
roofs
with
shingles
linoleum
corrugated
tin
even
plywood
with
flattened
some
walls
were
wood
some
had
windows
some
were
made
from
old
with
handles
to
lower
them
in
the
day
then
roll
them
up
again
at
night
when
the
mosquitoes
came
out
most
of
the
settlers
slept
on
nets
a
second
wave
had
moved
into
the
settlement
just
as
i
arrived
and
rather
than
building
out
and
farther
away
from
their
neighbors
latrines
and
mysterious
sources
of
electrical
power
they
built
on
top
of
the
existing
structures
shoring
up
the
walls
where
necessary
it
was
hurricane
proof
but
neither
are
the
condos
that
property
owners
occupy
they
made
contractual
arrangements
with
the
dwellers
of
the
first
stories
paid
them
rent
a
couple
with
rooms
opposite
one
another
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
consummated
their
relationship
by
building
a
between
their
rooms
paying
joint
rent
to
two
landlords
the
thing
these
motley
houses
had
in
common
all
of
them
was
ingenuity
and
pride
of
work
they
had
neat
vegetable
gardens
and
fresh
paint
they
had
kids
bikes
leaned
up
against
their
walls
and
the
smell
of
good
cooking
in
the
air
they
were
homely
homes
many
of
the
people
who
lived
in
these
houses
worked
regular
service
jobs
walking
three
miles
to
the
nearest
city
bus
stop
every
morning
and
three
miles
back
every
evening
they
sent
their
kids
to
school
faking
local
addresses
with
po
boxes
some
were
retired
some
were
just
down
on
their
luck
they
helped
each
other
when
something
precious
was
stolen
the
community
pitched
in
to
find
the
thieves
when
one
of
them
started
a
little
business
selling
sodas
or
sandwiches
out
of
her
shanty
the
others
patronized
her
when
someone
needed
medical
care
they
chipped
in
for
a
taxi
to
the
free
clinic
or
someone
with
a
working
car
drove
them
they
were
like
the
neighbors
of
the
american
town
an
ideal
of
civic
virtue
that
is
so
remote
in
our
ancestry
as
to
have
become
mythical
there
were
eyes
on
the
street
here
proud
residents
who
knew
what
everyone
was
about
and
saw
to
it
that
bad
behavior
was
curbed
before
it
could
get
started
somehow
it
burned
down
the
fire
department
wo
investigate
because
this
was
an
illegal
homestead
so
they
do
much
care
about
how
the
fire
started
it
took
most
of
the
homes
and
most
of
their
meager
possessions
the
water
got
the
rest
the
fire
department
fight
the
fire
at
first
because
someone
at
city
hall
said
that
the
land
owner
would
let
them
on
the
property
as
it
turns
out
the
owner
of
that
sad
strip
of
land
between
an
orange
grove
and
the
side
of
a
highway
is
unknown
a
dispute
over
title
has
left
it
in
legal
limbo
that
let
the
squatters
settle
there
it
suspicious
all
right
various
entities
had
tried
to
evict
the
squatters
before
but
the
legal
hassles
left
them
in
happy
limbo
what
the
law
could
accomplish
the
fire
did
the
story
has
a
happy
ending
the
boys
have
moved
the
squatters
into
their
factory
and
now
they
have
condos
that
look
like
something
dr
seuss
designed
photo
gallery
like
the
central
park
shantytown
of
the
last
century
these
look
like
they
were
constructed
by
crazy
poets
and
distributed
by
a
whirlwind
that
had
been
drinking
as
a
press
account
of
the
day
had
it
last
year
the
city
completed
a
new
housing
project
nearby
to
here
and
social
workers
descended
on
the
shantytowners
to
get
them
to
pick
up
and
move
to
these
the
shantytowners
would
go
it
was
too
expensive
said
mrs
x
who
does
want
her
family
back
in
oklahoma
to
know
she
squatting
with
her
husband
and
their
young
daughter
we
ca
afford
rent
not
if
we
want
to
put
food
on
the
table
on
what
we
earn
she
made
the
right
decision
the
housing
project
is
an
urban
renewal
nightmare
filled
with
crime
and
junkies
the
kind
of
place
where
little
old
ladies
their
doors
and
order
in
groceries
that
they
pay
for
with
direct
debit
unwilling
to
keep
any
cash
around
the
squatter
village
was
a
shantytown
but
it
was
no
slum
it
was
a
neighborhood
that
could
be
improved
and
the
boys
are
doing
that
having
relocated
the
village
to
their
grounds
they
inventing
and
remixing
new
techniques
for
building
cheap
and
homey
shelter
fast
profile
ten
shanties
and
the
technology
inside
them
the
response
was
enormous
and
passionate
dozens
of
readers
wrote
to
tell
her
that
she
been
taken
in
by
these
crooks
who
had
stolen
the
land
they
squatted
she
expected
that
she
felt
that
way
herself
when
she
first
walked
past
the
shantytown
but
what
surprised
her
more
were
the
posts
and
emails
from
homeless
people
who
been
living
in
their
cars
on
the
streets
in
squatted
houses
or
in
shanties
to
read
these
you
think
that
half
her
readership
was
sleeping
rough
and
getting
online
at
libraries
starbuckses
and
stumbled
wireless
networks
that
they
accessed
with
antique
laptops
on
kettlewell
coming
down
to
see
this
perry
said
her
stomach
lurched
she
gotten
the
boys
in
trouble
is
he
mad
i
could
tell
i
got
voicemail
at
three
am
midnight
in
san
jose
the
hour
at
which
kettlewell
got
his
mad
impulses
he
be
here
this
afternoon
that
jet
makes
it
too
easy
for
him
to
get
around
she
said
and
stretched
out
her
back
sitting
at
her
desk
all
morning
answering
emails
and
cleaning
up
some
draft
posts
before
blogging
them
had
her
in
knots
it
was
practically
perry
she
began
then
trailed
off
it
all
right
he
said
i
know
why
you
did
it
christ
we
be
where
we
are
if
you
had
written
about
us
i
in
no
position
to
tell
you
to
stop
now
he
swallowed
the
month
since
the
shantytowners
had
moved
in
had
put
five
years
on
him
his
tan
was
fading
the
wrinkles
around
his
eyes
deeper
grey
salting
his
stubbly
beard
and
short
hair
but
you
help
me
with
kettlewell
right
i
come
along
and
write
down
what
he
says
she
said
that
usually
helps
kodacell
is
supposed
to
be
a
new
way
of
doing
business
decentralized
really
century
the
tech
press
and
bloggers
have
been
trumpeting
its
triumph
over
all
other
modes
of
commerce
but
what
does
decentralization
really
mean
on
her
blog
this
week
former
journalist
suzanne
church
reports
that
the
inmates
running
the
flagship
kodacell
asylum
in
suburban
florida
have
invited
an
entire
village
of
homeless
squatters
to
take
up
residence
at
their
factory
premises
describing
their
illegal
homesteading
as
condos
that
dr
seuss
might
have
designed
kodacell
shill
church
goes
on
to
describe
how
this
captive
audience
has
been
converted
to
a
workforce
for
kodacell
most
profitable
unit
most
profitable
is
a
relative
term
to
date
this
unit
has
turned
a
profit
of
about
million

report
by
contrast
the
old
kodak
most
profitable

made
twenty
times
that
in
its
last
quarter
of
operation
america
has
a
grand
tradition
of
this
kind
of
indentured
living
the
company
towns
of
the
century
are
the
original
model
for
this
kind
of
industrial
practice
in
the
usa
substandard
housing
and
only
one
employer
in
town
that
the
kind
of
brave
new
world
that
church
boyfriend
kettlewell
has
created
a
reader
writes
i
live
near
the
shantytown
that
was
relocated
to
the
kodacell
factory
in
florida
it
was
a
dangerous
slum
full
of
drug
dealers
none
of
the
parents
in
my
neighborhood
let
their
kids
ride
their
bikes
along
the
road
that
passed
it
by
it
was
a
haven
for
all
kinds
of
trash
there
you
have
it
the
future
of
the
american
workforce
junkie
squatters
working
for
starvation
wages
kettlewell
you
ca
let
jerks
like
freddy
run
this
company
just
looking
to
sell
this
is
how
the
brit
rags
write
it
all
meanspirited
sniping
suzanne
had
never
seen
kettlewell
so
frustrated
his
surfer
good
looks
were
fading
fast
he
was
getting
a
little
paunch
on
him
and
his
cheeks
were
sagging
off
his
bones
into
the
beginnings
of
jowls
his
car
had
pulled
up
to
the
end
of
the
driveway
and
he
gotten
out
and
walked
through
the
shantytown
with
the
air
of
a
man
in
a
dream
the
truckers
who
pulled
in
and
out
all
week
picking
up
orders
had
occasionally
had
a
curious
word
at
the
odd
little
settlement
but
for
suzanne
it
had
all
but
disappeared
into
her
normal
experience
kettlewell
made
it
strange
and
even
a
little
outrageous
just
by
his
stiff
outraged
walk
through
its
streets
you
think
i
letting
drive
this
decision
he
had
spittle
flecks
on
the
corners
of
his
mouth
christ
suzanne
you
supposed
to
be
the
adult
around
here
perry
looked
up
from
the
floor
in
front
of
him
which
he
had
been
staring
at
intently
suzanne
caught
his
involuntary
glare
at
kettlewell
before
he
dropped
his
eyes
again
lester
put
a
big
meaty
paw
on
perry
shoulder
kettlewell
was
oblivious
those
people
ca
stay
all
right
the
shareholders
are
baying
for
blood
the
fucking
liability
christ
what
if
one
of
those
places
burns
down
what
if
one
of
them
knifes
another
one
we
on
the
hook
for
everything
they
do
we
could
end
up
being
on
the
hook
for
a
fucking
irrationally
suzanne
burned
with
anger
at
freddy
he
had
written
every
venal
bilious
word
with
the
hope
that
it
would
result
in
a
scene
just
like
this
one
and
not
because
he
had
any
substantive
objection
to
what
was
going
on
simply
because
he
had
a
need
to
deride
that
which
others
hailed
he
was
afflicting
the
mighty
though
he
was
taking
on
the
very
meekest
people
who
had
including
a
means
of
speaking
up
for
themselves
perry
looked
up
you
asked
me
to
come
up
with
something
new
and
incredible
every
three
to
six
months
well
this
is
new
and
incredible
we
built
a
living
lab
on
our
doorstep
for
exploring
an
enormous
market
opportunity
to
provide
sustainable
technology
for
use
by
a
substantial
segment
of
the
population
who
have
no
fixed
address
there
are
millions
of
american
squatters
and
billions
of
squatters
worldwide
they
have
money
to
spend
and
no
one
else
is
trying
to
get
it
from
them
kettlewell
thrust
his
chin
forward
how
many
millions
how
much
money
do
they
have
to
spend
how
do
you
know
that
any
of
this
will
make
us
a
single
cent
where
the
market
research
was
there
any
or
did
you
just
invite
a
hundred
hobos
to
pitch
their
tent
out
front
of
my
factory
on
the
strength
of
your
guesses
lester
held
up
a
hand
we
do
have
any
market
research
kettlewell
because
we
do
have
a
on
the
team
anymore
been
taking
that
over
as
well
as
his
regular
work
and
he
been
working
himself
sick
for
you
we
flying
by
the
seat
of
our
pants
here
because
you
have
sent
us
a
pilot
you
need
an
mba
to
tell
you
not
to
turn
your
workplace
into
a
slum
kettlewell
said
he
was
boiling
suzanne
very
carefully
pulled
out
her
pad
and
wrote
this
down
it
was
all
she
had
but
sometimes
it
was
enough
kettlewell
noticed
get
out
he
said
i
want
to
talk
with
these
two
alone
no
suzanne
said
that
not
our
deal
i
get
to
document
everything
the
deal
kettlewell
glared
at
her
and
then
he
deflated
he
sagged
and
took
two
steps
to
the
chair
behind
perry
desk
and
collapsed
into
it
put
the
notebook
away
suzanne
please
she
silently
shook
her
head
at
him
he
locked
eyes
with
her
for
a
moment
then
nodded
curtly
she
resumed
writing
guys
the
major
shareholders
are
going
to
start
dumping
their
stock
this
week
a
couple
of
pension
funds
a
merchant
bank
it
about
ten
fifteen
percent
of
the
company
when
that
happens
our
ticker
price
is
going
to
fall
by
sixty
percent
or
more
they
going
to
short
us
because
they
do
like
what
we
done
here
perry
said
christ
that
ridiculous
kettlewell
sighed
and
put
his
face
in
his
hands
scrubbed
at
his
eyes
no
perry
no
they
doing
it
because
they
ca
figure
out
how
to
value
us
our
business
units
have
an
return
on
investment
but
there
not
enough
of
them
we
only
signed
a
thousand
teams
and
we
wanted
ten
thousand
so
ninety
percent
of
the
money
we
had
to
spend
is
sitting
in
the
bank
at
garbage
interest
rates
we
need
to
soak
up
that
money
with
big
projects
the
hoover
dam
hong
kong
disneyland
the
big
dig
all
we
got
are
little
projects
so
it
not
our
fault
then
is
it
lester
said
perry
was
staring
out
the
window
no
it
not
your
fault
but
this
does
help
this
is
a
disaster
waiting
to
turn
into
a
catastrophe
calm
down
landon
perry
said
calm
down
for
a
sec
and
listen
to
me
ok
kettlewell
looked
at
him
and
sighed
go
ahead
there
are
more
than
a
billion
squatters
worldwide
san
francisco
has
been
giving
out
tents
and
shopping
carts
ever
since
they
ran
out
of
shelter
beds
in
the
nineties
from
copenhagen
to
capetown
there
are
more
and
more
people
who
are
going
off
the
grid
often
in
the
middle
of
cities
suzanne
nodded
they
farm
detroit
in
the
ruins
of
old
buildings
raise
crops
and
sell
them
chickens
too
even
pigs
there
something
there
these
people
have
money
like
i
said
they
buy
and
sell
in
the
stream
of
commerce
they
often
have
to
buy
at
a
premium
because
the
services
and
goods
available
to
them
are
limited
think
of
how
a
homeless
person
ca
take
advantage
of
perishables
because
she
does
have
a
fridge
they
are
the
spirit
of
ingenuity
too
they
mod
their
cars
caves
anything
they
can
find
to
be
living
quarters
they
turn
rvs
into
permanent
homes
they
know
more
about
tents
sleeping
bags
and
cardboard
than
any
un
shelter
specialist
these
people
need
housing
goods
appliances
you
name
it
it
what
tjan
used
to
call
a
market
no
one
else
knows
it
there
you
want
something
you
can
spend
ungodly
amounts
of
money
on
this
is
it
get
every
team
in
the
company
to
come
up
with
products
for
these
people
soak
up
every
cent
they
spend
better
us
providing
them
with
quality
goods
at
reasonable
prices
than
letting
them
get
ripped
off
by
the
profiteers
who
have
a
captive
market
this
plant
is
a
living
lab
this
is
the
kind
of
market
intelligence
you
ca
buy
right
here
we
should
set
up
more
of
these
invite
squatters
all
over
the
country
to
move
onto
our
grounds
test
out
our
products
help
us
design
build
and
market
them
we
can
recruit
traveling
salespeople
to
go
door
to
door
in
the
shanties
and
take
orders
shit
man
you
talk
about
the
grameen
bank
all
the
time
why
not
go
into
business
providing
these
people
with
easy
microcredit
without
preying
on
them
the
way
the
banks
do
then
we
could
loan
them
money
to
buy
things
that
we
sell
them
that
they
use
to
better
their
lives
and
earn
more
money
so
they
can
pay
us
back
and
buy
more
things
and
borrow
more
money
kettlewell
held
up
a
hand
i
like
the
theory
it
a
nice
story
but
i
have
to
sell
this
to
my
board
and
they
want
more
than
stories
where
can
i
get
the
research
to
back
this
up
we
it
perry
said
this
place
right
here
there
no
numbers
to
prove
what
i
saying
is
right
because
everyone
who
knows
it
right
is
too
busy
chasing
after
it
and
no
one
else
believes
it
but
right
here
if
we
allowed
to
do
this
right
here
we
can
prove
it
got
the
capital
in
our
account
we
profitable
and
we
can
roll
those
profits
back
into
more
r
d
for
the
future
of
the
company
suzanne
was
writing
so
fast
she
was
getting
a
hand
cramp
perry
had
never
given
speeches
like
this
even
a
month
before
tjan
leaving
had
hurt
them
all
but
the
growth
it
had
precipitated
in
perry
was
stunning
kettlewell
argued
more
but
perry
was
a
steamroller
and
suzanne
was
writing
down
what
everyone
said
and
that
kept
it
all
civil
like
a
silent
camera
rolling
in
the
corner
of
the
room
no
one
looked
at
her
but
she
was
the
thing
they
were
conspicuously
not
looking
at
francis
took
the
news
calmly
sound
business
strategy
basically
it
what
i
been
telling
you
to
do
all
along
so
i
bound
to
like
it
it
took
a
couple
weeks
to
hive
off
the
home
aware
stuff
to
some
of
the
other
kodacell
perry
flew
a
bunch
spending
days
in
minnesota
oregon
ohio
and
michigan
overseeing
the
retooling
efforts
that
would
let
him
focus
on
his
new
project
by
the
time
he
got
back
lester
had
retooled
their
own
workspace
converting
it
to
four
functional
areas
communications
shelter
food
and
entertainment
they
were
francis
idea
he
said
gimpy
leg
was
bothering
him
more
and
more
but
he
overseen
the
work
from
a
rolling
ergonomic
it
his
version
of
the
hierarchy
of
needs
stuff
he
knows
for
sure
we
can
sell
it
was
the
first
time
the
boys
had
launched
something
new
without
knowing
what
it
was
where
they
started
with
a
niche
and
decided
to
fill
it
instead
of
starting
with
an
idea
and
looking
for
a
niche
for
it
you
going
to
underestimate
the
research
time
francis
said
during
one
of
their
brainstorms
where
they
had
been
covering
sheet
after
sheet
with
ideas
for
products
they
could
build
everyone
underestimates
research
time
deciding
what
to
make
is
always
harder
than
making
it
he
been
drinking
less
since
he
gotten
involved
in
the
retooling
effort
waking
earlier
bossing
around
his
posse
to
get
him
paper
bricks
tinkertoys
he
was
right
suzanne
steadily
recorded
the
weeks
ticking
by
as
the
four
competing
labs
designed
tested
and
scrapped
all
manner
of
tchotchkes
for
tramps
as
freddy
had
dubbed
it
in
a
spiraling
series
of
columns
but
the
press
was
mostly
positive
camera
crews
liked
to
come
by
and
shoot
the
compound
one
time
the
pretty
black
reporter
from
the
night
of
the
fire
came
by
and
said
very
nice
things
during
her
standup
her
name
was
maria
and
she
was
happy
to
talk
shop
with
suzanne
endlessly
fascinated
by
a
real
journalist
who
gone
permanently
slumming
on
the
internet
the
problem
is
that
all
this
stuff
is
too
specialized
it
has
too
many
prerequisites
perry
said
staring
at
a
waterproof
bag
that
could
be
filled
with
a
hose
allowed
to
dry
and
used
as
a
room
this
thing
is
great
for
refugees
but
it
too
all
for
squatters
they
have
to
be
able
to
heavily
customize
everything
they
use
to
fit
into
really
specialized
niches
more
squatters
had
arrived
to
take
up
residence
with
them
families
friends
a
couple
of
dodgy
drifters
and
a
third
story
was
going
onto
the
buildings
in
the
camp
they
were
even
more
dr
seussian
than
the
first
round
idiosyncratic
structures
that
had
to
be
built
light
to
avoid
crushing
the
floors
below
them
hanging
out
over
the
narrow
streets
corkscrewing
like
vines
seeking
sun
he
kept
staring
and
would
have
been
staring
still
had
he
not
heard
the
sirens
three
broward
county
sheriff
cars
were
racing
down
the
access
road
into
their
dead
mall
sirens
howling
lights
blazing
they
screeched
to
a
halt
at
the
shantytown
edge
and
their
doors
flew
open
four
cops
moved
quickly
into
the
shantytown
while
two
more
worked
the
radios
sheltering
by
the
cars
jesus
christ
perry
said
he
ran
for
the
door
but
suzanne
grabbed
him
do
run
toward
armed
cops
she
said
do
do
anything
that
looks
threatening
slow
down
perry
he
took
a
couple
deep
breaths
then
he
looked
around
his
lab
for
a
while
frantically
muttering
where
the
fuck
did
i
put
it
use
home
aware
she
said
he
shook
his
head
grimaced
went
to
a
keyboard
and
typed
megaphone
one
of
the
started
to
throb
with
a
white
glow
he
pulled
out
the
megaphone
and
went
to
his
window
attention
police
he
said
this
is
the
leaseholder
for
this
property
why
are
you
running
around
with
your
guns
drawn
what
is
going
on
the
police
at
the
cars
looked
toward
the
workshop
then
back
to
the
shantytown
then
back
to
the
workshop
seriously
this
is
not
cool
what
are
you
doing
here
one
of
the
cops
grabbed
the
mic
for
his
own
loudhailer
this
is
the
broward
county
sheriff
department
we
have
received
intelligence
that
an
armed
fugitive
is
on
these
premises
we
have
come
to
retrieve
him
well
that
weird
none
of
the
children
civilians
and
hardworking
people
here
are
fugitives
as
far
as
i
know
certainly
there
no
one
armed
around
here
why
do
you
get
back
in
your
cars
and
i
come
out
and
we
resolve
this
like
civilized
people
ok
the
cop
shook
his
head
and
reached
for
his
mic
again
and
then
there
were
two
gunshots
a
scream
and
a
third
perry
ran
for
the
door
and
suzanne
chased
after
him
trying
to
stop
him
the
cops
at
the
cars
were
talking
intently
into
their
radios
though
it
was
impossible
to
know
if
they
were
talking
to
their
comrades
in
the
shantytown
or
to
their
headquarters
perry
burst
out
of
the
factory
door
and
there
was
another
shot
and
he
spun
around
staggered
back
a
step
and
fell
down
like
a
sack
of
grain
there
was
blood
around
his
head
suzanne
stuck
her
hand
in
her
mouth
to
stifle
a
scream
and
stood
helplessly
in
the
doorway
of
the
workshop
just
a
few
paces
from
perry
lester
came
up
behind
her
and
firmly
moved
her
aside
he
lumbered
deliberately
and
slowly
and
fearlessly
to
perry
side
knelt
beside
him
touched
him
gently
his
face
was
grey
perry
thrashed
softly
and
suzanne
let
out
a
sound
like
a
cry
then
remembered
herself
and
took
out
her
camera
and
began
to
shoot
and
shoot
and
shoot
the
cops
lester
with
perry
like
a
tragic
pieta
the
shantytowners
running
back
and
forth
screaming
snap
of
the
cops
getting
out
of
their
cars
guns
in
hands
snap
of
them
fanning
out
around
the
shantytown
snap
of
them
coming
closer
and
closer
snap
of
a
cop
pointing
his
gun
at
lester
ordering
him
away
from
perry
snap
of
a
cop
approaching
her

said

looking
up
from
the
viewfinder

the
officer

is
going
out
live
right
now
the
officer
stepped
back
turned
his
head
muttered
in
his
mic
there
an
ambulance
coming
he
said
your
friend
was
shot
with
a
nonlethal
rubber
bullet
he
bleeding
from
the
head
lester
said
from
the
eye
suzanne
shuddered
ambulance
sirens
in
the
distance
lester
stroked
perry
hair
suzanne
took
a
step
back
and
panned
it
over
perry
ruined
face
bloody
and
swollen
the
rubber
bullet
must
have
taken
him
either
right
in
the
eye
or
just
over
it
perry
mason
gibbons
was
unarmed
and
posed
no
threat
to
deputy
badge
number
she
zoomed
in
on
it
when
he
was
shot
with
a
rubber
bullet
in
the
eye
he
is
unconscious
and
bloody
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
workshop
where
he
has
worked
quietly
and
unassumingly
to
invent
and
manufacture
new
technologies
the
cop
knew
when
to
cut
his
losses
he
turned
aside
and
walked
back
into
the
shantytown
leaving
suzanne
to
turn
her
camera
on
perry
on
the
emts
who
evacced
him
to
the
ambulance
on
the
three
injured
shantytowners
who
were
on
the
ambulance
with
him
on
the
corpse
they
wheeled
out
on
his
own
gurney
one
of
the
newcomers
to
the
shantytown
a
man
she
did
recognize
they
operated
on
perry
all
that
night
gingerly
tweezing
fragments
of
bone
from
his
shattered
left
orbit
out
of
his
eye
and
face
some
had
floated
to
the
back
of
the
socket
and
posed
a
special
risk
of
brain
damage
the
doctor
explained
into
her
camera
lester
was
a
rock
sitting
silently
in
the
waiting
room
talking
calmly
and
firmly
with
the
cops
and
over
the
phone
to
kettlewell
and
the
specially
impaneled
full
of
kodacell
lawyers
who
wanted
to
micromanage
this
freddy
filed
a
column
in
which
he
called
her
a
grandstanding
bint
and
accused
kodacell
of
harboring
dangerous
fugitives
he
dug
up
the
fact
that
one
of
the
newcomers
to
the
shantytown
not
the
one
they
killed
that
was
a
bystander
was
wanted
for
holding
up
a
with
a
corkscrew
the
year
before
lester
unscrewed
his
earphone
and
scrubbed
at
his
eyes
impulsively
she
leaned
over
and
gave
him
a
hug
he
stiffened
up
at
first
but
then
relaxed
and
enfolded
her
in
his
huge
warm
arms
she
could
barely
make
her
arms
meet
around
his
broad
soft
back
it
was
like
hugging
a
giant
loaf
of
bread
she
squeezed
tighter
and
he
did
too
he
was
a
good
hugger
you
holding
in
there
kiddo
she
said
yeah
he
murmured
into
her
neck
no
he
squeezed
tighter
as
well
as
i
need
to
anyway
the
doctor
pried
them
apart
to
tell
them
that
the
eeg
and
fmri
were
both
negative
for
any
and
that
they
managed
to
salvage
the
eye
probably
kodacell
was
springing
for
all
the
care
he
needed
cash
money
no
dorking
around
with
the
fucking
hmo
so
the
doctors
had
put
him
through
every
machine
on
the
premises
in
a
series
of
farcically
expensive
tests
i
hope
they
sue
the
cops
for
the
costs
the
doctor
said
she
was
pakistani
or
bangladeshi
with
a
faint
accent
and
very
pretty
even
with
the
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
i
read
your
columns
she
said
shaking
suzanne
hand
i
admire
the
work
you
do
she
said
shaking
lester
hand
i
was
born
in
delhi
we
were
squatters
who
were
given
a
deed
to
our
home
and
then
evicted
because
we
could
pay
the
taxes
we
had
to
build
again
in
the
rains
outside
of
the
city
and
then
again
when
we
were
evicted
again
she
had
two
brothers
who
were
working
for
startups
like
kodacell
but
run
by
other
firms
one
was
backed
by
mcdonald
the
other
by
the
investment
arm
suzanne
did
a
little
interview
with
her
about
her
brothers
projects
a
that
had
been
algorithmically
evolved
for
minimum
weight
and
maximum
protection
a
smart
skylight
that
deformed
itself
to
follow
light
based
on
simple
phototropic
controllers
the
brother
working
on
was
riding
a
tiger
and
could
barely
keep
up
with
orders
he
was
consuming
about
half
of
the
operational
capacity
of
the
mcdonald
network
and
climbing
fast
lester
joined
in
digging
on
the
details
he
been
following
the
skylights
in
blogs
and
on
a
list
or
two
and
he
heard
of
the
doctor
brother
which
really
tweaked
her
she
was
visibly
proud
of
her
family
but
your
work
is
most
important
things
for
the
homeless
we
get
them
in
here
sometimes
hurt
off
the
ambulances
we
usually
turn
them
away
again
the
ones
who
sell
off
the
highway
medians
and
at
the
traffic
lights
suzanne
had
seen
them
selling
homemade
cookies
oranges
flowers
newspapers
plasticky
toys
sad
or
beautiful
handicrafts
she
had
a
carved
coconut
covered
in
intricate
scrimshaw
that
she
bought
from
a
little
girl
who
was
all
skin
and
bones
except
for
her
malnourished
they
get
hit
by
cars
yes
the
doctor
said
deliberately
too
or
beaten
up
perry
was
moved
out
of
the
operating
theater
to
a
recovery
room
and
then
to
a
private
room
and
by
then
they
were
ready
to
collapse
though
there
was
so
much
email
in
response
to
her
posts
that
she
ended
up
pounding
on
her
computer
keyboard
all
the
way
home
as
lester
drove
them
squeezing
the
bridge
of
his
nose
to
stay
awake
she
did
even
take
her
clothes
off
before
collapsing
into
bed
they
need
the
tools
to
make
any
other
tools
is
what
perry
said
when
he
returned
from
the
hospital
the
side
of
his
head
still
swaddled
in
bandages
that
draped
over
his
injured
eye
they
shaved
his
head
at
his
insistence
saying
that
he
was
going
to
try
to
keep
his
hair
clean
with
all
the
bandages
it
made
him
look
younger
and
his
fine
stood
out
through
his
thin
scalp
when
he
finally
came
home
before
he
looked
like
a
outdoorsman
engineer
now
he
looked
like
a
radical
a
pirate
they
need
the
tools
that
will
let
them
build
anything
else
for
free
and
use
it
or
sell
it
he
gestured
at
the
rapid
prototyping
machines
they
had
the
printer
and
scanner
setups
i
mean
something
like
that
but
i
want
it
to
be
capable
of
printing
out
the
parts
necessary
to
assemble
another
one
machines
that
can
reproduce
themselves
francis
shifted
in
his
seat
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
with
those
everything
perry
said
his
eye
glinting
make
your
kitchen
fixtures
make
your
shoes
and
hat
make
your
kids
toys
if
it
in
the
stores
it
should
be
a
downloadable
too
make
toolchests
and
tools
make
it
and
build
it
and
sell
it
make
other
printers
and
sell
them
make
machines
that
make
the
goop
we
feed
into
the
printers
teach
a
man
to
fish
francis
teach
a
man
to
fucking
no
driven
by
research
his
oozed
sarcasm
the
thing
that
we
need
to
do
is
make
these
people
the
authors
of
their
own
destiny
they
put
up
the
sign
that
night
author
of
your
own
destiny
hung
over
the
workshop
door
suzanne
trailed
after
perry
transcribing
the
rants
that
spilled
out
of
his
mouth
as
he
explained
it
to
lester
and
francis
and
then
to
kettlewell
when
he
called
and
then
to
the
pretty
young
black
lady
from
the
tv
who
by
now
had
figured
out
that
there
was
a
real
story
in
her
backyard
then
to
an
npr
man
on
the
phone
and
then
to
a
cnn
crew
who
drove
in
from
miami
and
filmed
the
shantytown
and
the
workshop
like
japanese
tourists
at
disney
world
never
having
ventured
into
the
skanky
failed
suburbs
just
outside
of
town
francis
had
a
protege
who
had
a
real
dab
touch
with
the
printers
the
manufacturer
lester
former
employer
had
been
out
of
business
for
two
years
by
then
so
all
the
service
on
the
machines
had
to
be
done
on
the
premises
francis
protege
the
one
who
claimed
his
mother
had
pushed
his
father
under
a
bus
his
name
was
jason
watched
lester
work
on
recalcitrant
machines
silently
for
a
couple
days
then
started
to
hand
him
the
tool
he
needed
next
without
having
to
be
asked
then
he
diagnosed
a
problem
that
had
stumped
lester
all
morning
then
he
suggested
an
improvement
to
the
feedstock
pump
that
increased
the
mean
time
between
failures
by
a
couple
hours
no
man
no
not
like
that
jason
said
to
one
of
the
small
gang
of
boys
he
was
bossing
gently
or
you
snap
it
off
the
boy
snapped
it
off
and
jason
pulled
another
replacement
part
out
of
a
tub
and
said
see
like
and
snapped
it
on
the
small
gang
of
boys
regarded
him
with
something
like
awe
how
come
no
girls
suzanne
said
as
she
interviewed
him
while
he
took
a
perry
had
banned
cigarettes
from
all
indoor
workshops
nominally
to
keep
flames
away
from
the
various
industrial
chemicals
and
such
but
really
just
to
encourage
the
shantytowners
to
give
up
the
habit
that
they
could
afford
anyway
he
also
leaned
on
the
shantytowners
who
opened
up
small
shops
in
their
houses
to
keep
cigs
out
of
the
town
without
a
lot
of
success
girls
are
interested
in
this
stuff
lady
you
think
there
was
a
time
when
she
would
have
objected
but
it
was
better
to
let
these
guys
say
it
out
loud
hear
themselves
say
it
no
maybe
where
you
come
from
ok
do
know
but
here
girls
are
different
they
do
good
in
school
but
when
they
have
babies
done
i
mean
hey
it
not
like
i
do
girls
in
the
team
they
be
great
i
love
girls
they
fuckin
you
know
no
bullshit
no
screwing
around
but
i
know
every
girl
in
this
place
and
none
of
are
even
interested
ok
suzanne
cocked
one
eyebrow
just
a
little
and
jason
shifted
uncomfortably
he
scratched
his
bare
midriff
and
shuffled
i
do
all
of
them
why
would
they
one
girl
a
roomful
of
boys
it
be
gross
they
act
like
jerks
there
no
way
we
get
anything
done
suzanne
lifted
her
eyebrow
one
hair
higher
he
squirmed
harder
so
all
right
that
not
their
fault
but
i
got
enough
work
all
right
too
much
to
do
without
spending
time
on
that
it
not
like
any
girls
have
to
join
up
i
not
keeping
them
out
suzanne
jotted
a
couple
of
notes
keeping
perfectly
mum
well
i
like
to
have
them
in
the
workshop
ok
maybe
i
should
ask
some
of
them
if
they
come
shit
if
i
can
teach
these
apes
i
can
teach
a
girl
they
smart
girls
make
this
place
a
little
better
to
work
in
lots
of
them
trying
to
support
their
families
so
they
need
the
money
too
there
was
a
girl
there
by
the
afternoon
the
next
day
there
were
two
more
they
seemed
like
quick
studies
despite
their
youth
and
their
suzanne
approved
lester
stayed
long
enough
to
see
the
first
prototype
running
then
he
lit
out
with
a
duffel
bag
jammed
into
the
back
of
his
modded
smart
car
where
are
you
going
suzanne
said
as
perry
looked
on
gloomily
i
come
and
visit
you
i
want
to
follow
your
story
truth
be
told
she
was
sorry
to
see
him
go
very
sorry
he
was
such
a
rock
such
an
anchor
for
perry
new
crazy
pirate
energy
and
for
the
madness
around
them
he
had
given
much
notice
not
to
her
perry
did
seem
that
surprised
i
ca
really
talk
about
it
he
said
nondisclosure
so
it
a
new
job
she
said
you
going
to
work
for
tjan
westinghouse
operation
was
fully
rocking
he
had
fifty
teams
up
the
eastern
seaboard
ten
in
the
midwest
and
was
rumored
to
have
twice
as
many
in
eastern
europe
he
grinned
oh
suzanne
do
try
to
journalist
me
he
reached
out
and
hugged
her
in
a
cloud
of
her
father
cologne
you
fantastic
you
know
that
no
i
not
going
to
a
job
it
a
thing
that
an
amazing
opportunity
you
know
she
did
but
then
he
was
gone
and
boy
did
she
miss
him
perry
and
she
went
out
for
dinner
in
miami
the
next
night
with
a
phd
candidate
from
pepperdine
eating
at
the
same
deco
patio
that
she
dined
at
with
tjan
perry
wore
a
white
shirt
open
to
reveal
his
tangle
of
wiry
chest
hair
and
the
waitress
could
keep
her
eyes
off
of
him
he
had
a
permanent
squint
now
and
a
scar
that
made
his
eyebrow
into
a
series
of
small
hills
i
was
just
in
greensboro
miss
the
phd
candidate
said
he
was
in
his
young
and
slick
his
only
nod
to
academe
a
small
goatee
i
used
to
spend
summers
there
with
my
grandpa
he
talked
fast
flecks
of
spittle
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
eyes
wide
fork
stabbing
blindly
at
the
bits
of
on
his
plate
there
left
there
just
a
couple
and
a
shit
they
even
closed
the
but
now
but
now
it
again
it
buzzing
and
hopping
every
empty
storefront
is
full
of
people
playing
and
tinkering
just
a
little
bit
of
money
in
their
pockets
from
a
bank
or
a
company
or
a
fund
they
doing
the
dumbest
things
mind
you
laptop
cases
switchblade
knives
with
thumb
drives
in
the
handles
singing
and
dancing
that
yodel
like
hillbillies
i
buy
a
laptop
case
perry
said
swilling
a
sweaty
bottle
of
beer
he
waggled
his
funny
eyebrow
and
rubbed
his
fuzzy
scalp
the
rate
of
employment
is
something
like
percent
which
it
has
been
in
like
a
hundred
years
if
you
not
inventing
stuff
you
keeping
the
books
for
someone
who
is
or
making
sandwiches
for
them
or
driving
delivery
vehicles
around
it
like
a
tiny
distributed
gold
rush
or
like
the
new
deal
suzanne
said
that
was
how
she
come
to
invite
him
down
after
she
read
his
paper
coining
the
term
new
work
to
describe
what
perry
was
up
to
comparing
it
to
plan
that
spent
america
free
of
the
depression
yeah
exactly
exactly
i
got
research
that
shows
that
one
in
five
americans
is
employed
in
the
new
work
industry
twenty
percent
perry
lazy
eye
opened
a
little
wider
no
way
he
said
way
the
phd
candidate
said
he
finished
his
caipirinha
and
shook
the
crushed
ice
at
a
passing
waiter
who
nodded
and
ambled
to
the
bar
to
get
him
a
fresh
one
you
should
get
on
the
road
and
write
about
some
of
these
guys
he
said
to
suzanne
they
need
some
ink
some
phosphors
they
pulling
up
stakes
and
moving
to
the
small
towns
their
parents
came
from
or
to
abandoned
suburbs
and
just
bravest
fucking
thing
you
seen
in
your
life
the
phd
candidate
stayed
out
the
week
and
went
home
with
a
suitcase
full
of
the
parts
necessary
to
build
a
printer
that
could
print
out
all
of
the
parts
necessary
to
build
a
printer
lester
emailed
her
from
wherever
it
was
he
gone
and
told
her
about
the
lovely
time
he
was
having
it
made
her
miss
him
sharply
perry
was
hardly
ever
around
for
her
now
buried
in
his
work
buried
with
the
kids
from
the
shantytown
and
with
francis
she
looked
over
her
last
month
blogs
and
realized
that
she
been
turning
in
variations
on
the
same
theme
for
all
that
time
she
knew
it
was
time
to
pack
a
duffel
bag
of
her
own
and
go
see
the
bravest
fucking
thing
she
seen
in
her
life
bye
perry
she
said
stopping
by
his
workbench
he
looked
up
at
her
and
saw
the
bag
and
his
funny
eyebrow
wobbled
leaving
for
good
he
said
he
sounded
unexpectedly
bitter
no
she
said
no
just
a
couple
weeks
going
to
get
the
rest
of
the
story
but
i
be
back
count
on
it
he
grunted
and
slumped
he
was
looking
a
lot
older
now
and
beaten
down
his
hair
growing
out
was
half
grey
and
he
gotten
gaunt
his
cheekbones
and
forehead
springing
out
of
his
face
on
impulse
she
gave
him
a
hug
like
the
ones
she
shared
with
lester
he
returned
it
woodenly
at
first
then
with
genuine
warmth
i
will
be
back
you
know
she
said
you
got
plenty
to
do
here
anyway
yeah
he
said
course
i
do
she
kissed
him
firmly
on
the
cheek
and
stepped
out
the
door
and
into
her
car
and
drove
to
miami
international
tjan
met
her
at
logan
and
took
her
bag
i
surprised
you
had
the
time
to
meet
me
she
said
the
months
had
been
good
to
him
slimming
down
his
and
putting
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
got
a
good
organization
he
said
as
they
motored
away
toward
rhode
island
through
suburbs
and
past
chain
restaurants
everywhere
there
were
signs
of
industry
workshops
in
old
storefronts
roadside
stands
selling
disposable
music
players
digital
whoopee
cushions
and
so
forth
i
barely
have
to
put
in
an
appearance
tjan
yawned
hugely
and
constantly
he
apologized
got
back
from
russia
a
couple
days
ago
did
you
see
your
kids
she
said
how
business
there
i
saw
my
kids
he
said
and
grinned
they
amazing
you
know
that
good
kids
unbelievably
smart
real
little
operators
the
older
one
lyenitchka
is
running
a
service
not
herself
you
see
but
recruiting
other
kids
to
do
the
sitting
for
her
while
she
skims
a
management
fee
and
runs
the
quality
control
she
your
daughter
all
right
she
said
so
tell
me
everything
about
the
westinghouse
projects
she
been
following
them
of
course
lots
of
different
little
startups
each
with
its
own
blogs
and
such
but
tjan
was
quite
fearless
about
taking
her
through
their
profits
and
losses
and
taking
notes
on
it
all
kept
her
busy
until
she
reached
her
hotel
tjan
dropped
her
off
and
promised
to
pick
her
up
the
next
morning
for
a
vip
tour
of
the
best
of
his
teams
and
she
went
to
check
in
she
was
in
the
middle
of
receiving
her
key
when
someone
grabbed
her
shoulder
and
squeezed
it
suzanne
bloody
church
what
are
you
doing
here
love
the
smell
of
his
breath
was
like
a
dead
thing
left
to
fester
she
turned
around
slowly
not
wanting
to
believe
that
of
all
the
hotels
in
rural
rhode
island
she
ended
up
checking
into
the
same
one
as
freddy
hey
freddy
she
said
seeing
him
gave
her
an
atavistic
urge
to
stab
him
repeatedly
in
the
throat
with
the
hotel
he
was
unshaven
his
gawky
adam
apple
bobbing
up
and
down
and
he
swallowed
and
smiled
wetly
nice
to
see
you
fantastic
to
see
you
too
i
here
covering
a
shareholder
meeting
for
westinghouse
is
that
what
you
here
for
too
no
she
said
she
knew
the
meeting
was
on
that
week
but
planned
on
attending
it
she
was
done
with
press
conferences
preferring
reporting
well
nice
to
see
you
oh
do
stay
for
a
drink
he
said
grinning
more
widely
exposing
those
grey
teeth
in
a
shark
smile
come
on
they
have
a
free
cocktail
hour
in
this
place
i
have
to
report
you
to
the
journalist
union
if
you
turn
down
a
free
drink
i
do
think
have
to
worry
about
the
journalist
union
she
said
making
sarcastic
in
case
he
did
get
the
message
he
still
did
he
laughed
instead
oh
love
i
sure
they
still
have
you
even
if
you
have
lapsed
away
from
the
one
true
faith
good
night
freddy
was
all
she
could
manage
to
get
out
without
actually
hissing
through
her
teeth
ok
good
night
he
said
moving
in
to
give
her
a
hug
as
he
loomed
toward
her
she
snapped
freeze
mister
you
are
not
my
friend
i
do
not
want
to
touch
you
you
have
poor
personal
hygiene
and
your
breath
smells
like
an
overflowing
you
write
vicious
personal
attacks
on
me
and
on
the
people
i
care
about
you
are
unfair
meanspirited
and
you
write
badly
the
only
day
i
would
piss
on
you
freddy
is
the
day
you
were
on
fire
now
get
the
fuck
out
of
my
way
before
i
kick
your
tiny
little
testicles
up
through
the
roof
of
your
reeking
mouth
she
said
it
quietly
but
the
behind
her
overheard
it
anyway
and
giggled
freddy
smile
only
wobbled
but
then
returned
broader
than
ever
well
said
he
said
and
gave
her
a
single
sleep
well
suzanne
she
boiled
all
the
way
to
her
room
and
when
she
came
over
hungry
she
ordered
in
room
service
not
wanting
to
take
the
chance
that
freddy
would
still
be
in
the
lobby
tjan
met
her
as
she
was
finishing
her
coffee
in
the
breakfast
room
she
had
seen
freddy
yet
i
got
five
projects
slated
for
you
to
visit
today
tjan
said
sliding
into
the
booth
beside
her
funnily
now
that
he
was
in
the
cold
northeast
he
was
dressing
like
a
floridian
in
blue
jeans
and
a
barkcloth
shirt
with
a
bright
spatter
of
pineapples
and
oscar
mayer
wienermobiles
back
in
florida
he
favored
unflattering
nylon
slacks
and
white
shirts
with
ironed
collars
the
projects
were
fascinating
and
familiar
the
cultural
differences
that
distinguished
new
england
new
work
from
florida
new
work
were
small
but
telling
a
lot
more
woodcraft
in
a
part
of
the
country
where
many
people
had
grown
up
in
their
grandfathers
woodworking
shops
a
little
more
unreflexive
kitsch
like
the
homely
kittens
and
puppies
that
marched
around
the
reactive
waterproof
screens
integrated
into
a
crib
at
the
fourth
site
she
was
ambushed
by
a
flying
hug
tjan
laughed
as
she
nearly
went
down
under
the
weight
of
a
strong
young
woman
who
flung
her
arms
around
suzanne
neck
holy
it
good
to
see
you
suzanne
untangled
herself
and
got
a
look
at
her
hugger
she
had
short
mousy
hair
twinkling
blue
eyes
and
was
dressed
in
overalls
and
a
pretty
flowered
blouse
scuffed
work
boots
and
stained
and
torn
uh
she
said
then
it
clicked
fiona
yeah
did
tjan
tell
you
i
was
here
the
last
time
she
seen
this
woman
she
was
weeping
over
pizza
and
getting
ready
to
give
up
on
life
now
she
was
practically
vibrating
uh
no
she
said
shooting
a
look
at
tjan
who
was
smiling
like
the
buddha
and
pretending
to
inspect
a
pair
of
shoes
with
gyroscopically
stabilized
retractable
wheels
in
the
heels
i
been
here
for
months
i
went
back
to
oregon
like
you
told
me
to
and
then
i
saw
a
recruiting
ad
for
westinghouse
and
i
sent
them
my
cv
and
then
i
got
a
videoconference
interview
and
then
bam
i
was
on
an
airplane
to
rhode
island
suzanne
blinked
told
you
to
go
back
to
oregon
well
maybe
she
had
that
was
a
lifetime
ago
the
workshop
was
another
dead
mall
this
one
a
horseshoe
of
storefronts
separated
by
flimsy
gyprock
the
westinghousers
had
cut
through
the
walls
with
drywall
knives
to
join
all
the
stores
together
the
air
was
permeated
with
the
familiar
tang
of
printers
the
parking
lot
was
given
over
to
some
larger
apparatus
and
a
fantastical
in
the
shape
of
a
baroque
spired
pirate
fortress
with
elegantly
curved
turrets
corkscrew
and
flying
buttresses
crusted
over
with
ornate
grotesque
gargoyles
children
swarmed
over
it
like
ants
screeching
with
pleasure
well
you
looking
really
good
fiona
suzanne
said
not
great
with
she
thought
fiona
though
was
indeed
looking
good
and
beaming
she
was
wearing
the
crust
of
cosmetics
and
products
she
affected
in
the
corporate
silicon
valley
world
she
glowed
pink
suzanne
fiona
said
getting
serious
now
taking
her
by
the
shoulders
and
looking
into
her
eyes
i
ca
thank
you
enough
for
this
this
has
saved
my
life
it
gave
me
something
to
live
for
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
am
doing
something
i
proud
of
i
go
to
bed
every
night
thankful
and
happy
that
i
ended
up
here
thank
you
suzanne
thank
you
suzanne
tried
not
to
squirm
fiona
gave
her
another
long
hug
all
your
doing
suzanne
said
at
last
i
just
told
you
about
it
you
made
this
happen
for
you
ok
ok
fiona
said
but
i
still
would
be
here
if
it
was
for
you
i
love
you
suzanne
ick
suzanne
gave
her
another
perfunctory
hug
and
got
the
hell
out
of
dodge
what
with
the
it
really
had
been
something
fun
and
that
the
big
one
tjan
said
with
a
big
grin
most
people
even
notice
it
they
think
it
daycare
or
something
well
that
how
it
started
out
but
then
some
of
the
sensor
people
started
noodling
with
components
that
could
tell
how
often
they
were
played
with
they
started
modding
the
gym
every
night
adding
variations
on
the
elements
that
saw
the
most
action
removing
the
duds
then
the
cad
people
added
an
algorithm
that
would
take
the
sensor
data
and
generate
random
variations
on
the
same
basis
finally
some
of
the
robotics
people
got
in
on
the
act
so
that
the
best
of
the
designs
could
be
instantiated
automatically
now
it
a
the
kids
love
it
it
is
the
crack
cocaine
of
though
we
wo
be
using
that
in
the
marketing
copy
of
course
of
course
suzanne
said
drily
she
automatically
reached
for
her
notepad
and
started
writing
when
tjan
started
talking
now
reviewing
her
notes
she
knew
that
she
was
going
to
have
to
go
back
and
get
some
photos
of
this
she
asked
tjan
about
it
the
robots
go
all
night
you
know
not
much
sleep
if
you
do
that
no
going
back
to
the
hotel
to
see
freddy
what
a
pity
i
grab
a
couple
blankets
from
the
hotel
to
keep
warm
she
said
oh
you
need
he
said
that
crew
has
a
set
of
bleachers
with
for
the
night
crew
and
their
family
to
watch
from
pretty
gorgeous
if
you
ask
me
they
had
a
hasty
supper
of
burgers
at
a
and
then
went
back
to
the
project
suzanne
ensconced
herself
at
vacated
desk
for
a
couple
hours
and
caught
up
on
email
before
finally
emerging
as
the
sun
was
dipping
swollen
and
red
behind
the
mall
she
set
herself
up
on
the
bleachers
and
fiona
found
her
with
a
thermos
of
coffee
and
a
flask
of
whisky
they
snuggled
under
a
blanket
amid
a
small
crowd
of
geeks
an
outdoor
slumber
party
under
the
roar
gradually
the
robots
made
an
appearance
most
of
them
humped
along
like
inchworms
carrying
chunks
of
new
playground
apparatus
in
coils
of
their
long
bodies
some
deployed
manipulator
arms
though
they
did
have
much
by
way
of
hands
at
their
ends
we
just
use
magnets
fiona
said
less
fiddly
than
trying
to
get
artificial
vision
that
can
accurately
grasp
the
bars
tjan
nudged
her
and
pointed
to
a
new
tower
that
was
going
up
the
robots
were
twisting
around
themselves
to
form
a
scaffold
while
various
of
their
number
crawled
higher
and
higher
snapping
modular
pieces
of
plastic
together
with
sounds
that
were
audible
over
the
whine
of
their
motors
suzanne
switched
on
her
camera
mode
and
got
shooting
where
did
you
get
all
these
robots
tjan
grinned
it
an
open
design
the
epa
hired
westinghouse
to
build
these
to
work
on
sensing
and
removing
volatile
organic
compounds
on
superfund
sites
because
we
did
the
work
for
the
government
we
had
to
agree
not
to
claim
any
design
copyright
or
patents
in
the
outcome
there
a
freaking
warehouse
full
of
this
stuff
at
westinghouse
all
kinds
of
crazy
things
that
westinghouse
abandoned
because
they
were
proprietary
enough
and
they
were
worried
that
they
have
to
compete
on
the
open
market
if
they
tried
to
productize
them
suits
us
just
fine
though
the
field
was
aswarm
with
glinting
metal
inchworm
robots
now
shifting
back
and
forth
boiling
and
roiling
and
picking
up
enormous
chunks
of
climber
like
cartoon
ants
carrying
away
a
picnic
basket
the
playground
was
being
transformed
before
her
eyes
in
ways
gross
and
subtle
and
it
was
enchanting
to
watch
can
i
go
out
and
have
a
look
she
said
i
mean
is
it
safe
sure
fiona
said
of
course
our
robots
wo
harm
you
they
just
nuzzle
you
and
then
change
direction
still
try
to
stay
out
of
their
way
tjan
said
some
of
that
stuff
they
moving
around
is
heavy
so
she
waded
out
onto
the
playground
and
carefully
picked
her
way
through
the
robot
swarm
some
crawled
over
her
toes
a
couple
twined
between
her
feet
and
nearly
tripped
her
up
and
once
she
stepped
on
one
and
it
went
still
and
waited
politely
for
her
to
step
off
once
in
the
thick
of
it
all
she
switched
on
her
video
and
began
to
record
through
the
night
filter
standing
there
amid
the
whirl
and
racket
and
undulating
motion
of
the
jungle
gym
as
it
reconfigured
itself
she
felt
like
she
arrived
at
some
posthuman
future
where
the
world
no
longer
needed
her
or
her
kind
like
humanity
creations
had
evolved
past
their
inventors
she
was
going
to
have
to
do
a
of
writing
before
bed
freddy
was
checking
out
in
the
lobby
when
tjan
dropped
her
off
at
it
was
impossible
to
sneak
past
him
and
he
gave
her
a
nasty
bucktoothed
smile
as
she
passed
by
him
it
distracted
her
and
made
the
writing
come
more
slowly
but
she
was
a
pro
and
her
readers
had
sent
in
a
lot
of
kind
mail
and
there
was
one
from
lester
still
away
on
his
mysterious
errand
but
sounding
happier
than
he
had
in
months
positively
giddy
she
set
the
so
that
she
could
be
awake
for
her
next
stop
outside
of
north
carolina
research
triangle
where
some
local
millionaires
had
backed
a
dozen
new
work
teams
another
three
weeks
of
this
stuff
and
she
get
to
go
home
florida
the
condo
was
home
now
and
the
junkyard
hot
and
sticky
and
inventive
and
she
fell
asleep
thinking
of
it
and
smiling
it
was
two
weeks
more
before
lester
caught
up
with
her
in
detroit
of
all
places
going
back
to
the
old
place
had
been
her
idea
been
dragged
back
by
impassioned
pleas
from
the
local
ford
and
gm
new
work
teams
who
were
old
families
who
rebooted
with
money
from
the
companies
that
had
wrung
their
profit
from
their
ancestors
and
abandoned
them
the
big
focus
in
the
rustbelt
was
eradicating
the
car
some
were
building
robots
that
could
decommission
leaky
and
crater
out
the
toxic
soil
some
were
building
plants
that
reclaimed
materials
from
the
old
beasts
interiors
between
the
ford
and
gm
teams
with
their
latest
and
those
funded
by
the
uaw
out
of
the
settlements
they
won
from
the
detroit
was
springing
up
anew
lester
emailed
her
and
said
that
he
seen
on
her
blog
that
she
was
headed
to
detroit
and
did
she
want
to
meet
him
for
dinner
being
as
he
be
in
town
too
they
ate
at
devil
night
a
restaurant
in
one
of
the
reclaimed
mansions
in
brush
park
a
neighborhood
of
buildings
that
teenagers
had
all
but
burned
to
the
ground
over
several
decades
worth
of
halloweens
in
detroit
devil
night
was
the
tradition
of
torching
abandoned
buildings
and
all
of
brush
park
had
been
abandoned
for
years
its
handsome
houses
attractive
targets
for
midnight
firebugs
reclaiming
these
buildings
was
an
artisanal
practice
of
urethaning
the
charred
wood
and
adding
clever
putty
cement
and
glass
to
preserve
the
look
of
a
burned
out
hulk
while
restoring
structural
integrity
one
entire
floor
of
the
restaurant
was
missing
having
been
replaced
by
polished
tempered
glass
that
let
upstairs
diners
look
down
on
the
bald
spots
and
cleavage
of
those
eating
below
suzanne
showed
up
a
few
minutes
late
having
gotten
lost
wandering
the
streets
of
a
detroit
that
had
rewritten
its
map
in
the
decades
since
she
left
she
was
flustered
and
not
just
because
she
was
running
late
there
was
a
lingering
awkwardness
between
her
and
lester
and
her
elation
at
seeing
him
again
had
an
inescapable
undercurrent
of
dread
when
the
waiter
pointed
out
her
table
she
told
him
he
was
mistaken
lester
was
there
some
stranger
was
burly
with
a
few
days
stubble
he
wore
a
smart
blazer
and
a
loose
striped
cotton
shirt
underneath
he
was
beaming
at
her
suzanne
he
said
her
jaw
literally
dropped
she
realized
she
was
standing
with
her
mouth
open
and
shut
it
with
a
snap
lester
she
said
wonderingly
he
got
up
still
smiling
even
laughing
a
little
and
gave
her
a
hug
it
was
lester
all
right
that
smell
was
unmistakable
and
those
big
warm
paws
he
called
hands
when
he
let
go
of
her
he
laughed
again
oh
suzanne
i
could
have
asked
for
any
better
reaction
than
this
they
were
drawing
stares
dazedly
she
sat
down
so
did
he
lester
she
said
again
yes
it
me
he
said
i
tell
you
about
it
over
dinner
the
waiter
wants
to
take
our
drink
orders
theatrically
she
ordered
a
double
scotch
the
waiter
rattled
off
the
specials
and
suzanne
picked
one
at
random
so
did
lester
so
he
said
patting
his
washboard
tummy
you
want
to
know
how
i
got
to
this
in
ten
weeks
huh
can
i
take
notes
suzanne
said
pulling
out
her
pad
oh
by
all
means
he
said
i
got
a
discount
on
my
treatments
on
the
basis
that
you
would
end
up
taking
notes
the
clinic
was
in
st
petersburg
russia
in
a
neighborhood
filled
with
russian
dentists
who
catered
to
american
health
tourists
who
want
to
pay
us
prices
for
crowns
the
treatment
had
originated
there
the
electromuscular
stimulation
and
chemical
therapy
for
was
standard
for
rich
new
mothers
in
hollywood
who
wanted
to
get
rid
of
pregnancy
bellies
the
hormones
had
been
used
in
the
mexican
pharma
industry
for
years
had
been
an
effective
substitute
for
steroids
when
it
came
to
building
muscle
in
professional
athletic
circles
the
world
round
genomic
therapy
using
genes
cribbed
from
hummingbirds
boosted
metabolism
so
that
the
body
burned
calories
a
day
sitting
still
but
the
st
petersburg
clinic
had
ripped
mixed
and
burned
these
different
procedures
to
make
a
single
holistic
treatment
that
had
dropped
lester
from
to
pounds
in
ten
weeks
is
that
safe
she
said
everyone
asks
that
he
said
laughing
yeah
it
safe
if
monitoring
you
and
standing
by
with
lots
of
diagnostic
equipment
but
if
you
willing
to
take
slower
losses
you
can
go
on
a
way
less
intensive
regime
that
wo
require
supervision
this
stuff
is
the
next
big
pharma
gold
they
violating
all
kinds
of
pharma
patents
of
course
but
that
what
cuba
and
canada
are
for
right
inside
of
a
year
every
fat
person
in
america
is
going
to
have
a
bottle
of
pills
in
his
pocket
and
inside
of
two
years
there
be
any
fat
people
she
shook
her
head
you
look
lester
you
look
i
so
proud
of
you
he
ducked
his
head
he
really
did
look
amazing
dropping
the
weight
had
taken
off
ten
years
and
between
that
and
the
haircut
and
the
new
clothes
he
was
practically
unrecognizable
does
perry
know
yeah
lester
said
i
talked
it
over
with
him
before
i
opted
for
it
tjan
had
mentioned
it
in
passing
it
was
a
business
his
was
tangled
up
with
through
her
mafiyeh
connections
and
once
i
had
researched
it
online
and
talked
to
some
people
who
had
the
treatment
including
a
couple
mds
i
decided
to
just
do
it
it
had
cost
nearly
everything
he
made
from
kodacell
but
it
was
a
small
price
to
pay
he
insisted
on
getting
dinner
afterward
they
strolled
through
the
fragrant
evening
down
woodward
avenue
past
the
deco
skyscrapers
and
the
plowed
fields
and
community
gardens
their
livestock
pens
making
soft
animal
noises
it
wonderful
to
see
you
again
lester
she
said
truthfully
really
missed
him
even
though
his
participation
on
her
message
boards
had
hardly
let
up
though
it
had
started
coming
in
at
weird
hours
something
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
been
in
russia
walking
alongside
of
him
smelling
his
smell
seeing
him
only
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
it
was
like
nothing
had
changed
it
great
to
see
you
again
too
tentatively
he
took
her
hand
in
his
big
paw
his
hand
was
warm
but
not
sweaty
and
she
realized
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
anyone
had
held
her
hand
heart
pounding
she
gave
his
hand
a
squeeze
their
conversation
and
their
walk
rambled
on
with
no
outward
acknowledgment
of
the
contact
of
hand
on
hand
but
her
hand
squeezed
his
softly
now
and
again
or
he
squeezed
hers
and
then
they
were
at
her
hotel
did
that
happen
she
asked
herself
but
then
they
were
having
a
nightcap
and
then
he
was
in
the
elevator
with
her
and
then
he
was
at
the
door
of
her
room
and
the
blood
was
roaring
in
her
ears
as
she
stuck
her
in
the
reader
to
open
it
she
tried
to
say
hang
on
a
second
is
what
she
tried
to
say
but
her
tongue
was
thick
in
her
mouth
he
stepped
through
the
door
with
her
then
said
uh
i
need
to
use
the
bathroom
with
relief
she
directed
him
to
the
small
water
closet
the
room
was
basic
now
that
she
was
her
own
boss
she
was
springing
for
crowne
plazas
and
hiltons
this
was
practically
a
coffin
and
there
was
nowhere
to
sit
except
the
bed
her
laptop
was
open
and
there
was
a
lot
of
email
in
her
inbox
but
for
once
she
did
care
she
was
keenly
attuned
to
the
water
noises
coming
from
behind
the
door
each
new
sound
making
her
jump
a
little
what
was
he
doing
in
there
inserting
a
fucking
diaphragm
she
heard
him
work
the
latch
on
the
door
and
she
put
on
her
best
smile
her
stomach
was
full
of
butterflies
he
smiled
back
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
next
to
her
taking
her
hand
again
his
hand
was
moist
from
being
washed
and
a
little
slippery
she
did
mind
wordlessly
she
put
her
head
on
his
barrel
chest
his
heart
was
racing
and
so
was
hers
gradually
they
leaned
back
until
they
were
side
by
side
on
the
bed
her
head
still
on
his
chest
moving
like
she
was
in
a
dream
she
lifted
her
head
from
his
chest
and
stared
into
his
eyes
they
were
wide
and
scared
she
kissed
him
softly
his
lips
were
trembling
and
unyielding
she
kissed
him
more
insistently
running
her
hands
over
his
chest
and
shoulders
putting
one
leg
over
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
kissed
her
back
he
was
bad
but
he
was
scared
or
nervous
and
all
jittery
she
kissed
his
throat
breathing
in
the
smell
savoring
the
rough
texture
of
his
beard
tentatively
he
put
his
hands
on
her
back
stroked
her
worked
gradually
towards
her
bottom
then
he
stopped
what
wrong
she
said
propping
herself
up
on
her
forearms
still
straddling
him
she
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
lester
what
wrong
he
opened
his
mouth
and
then
shut
it
tears
slid
off
his
face
into
his
ears
she
blotted
them
with
a
corner
of
she
stroked
his
hair
lester
he
gave
out
a
choked
sob
and
pushed
her
away
he
sat
up
and
put
his
face
in
his
hands
his
back
heaved
she
stroked
his
shoulders
tentatively
finally
he
seemed
to
get
himself
under
control
he
sniffled
i
have
to
go
he
said
lester
what
i
ca
do
this
he
said
i
just
tell
me
she
said
whatever
it
is
tell
me
you
did
want
me
before
he
said
it
simply
without
accusation
but
it
stung
like
he
slapped
her
in
the
face
oh
lester
she
said
moving
to
hug
him
but
he
pushed
her
away
i
have
to
go
he
said
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
he
was
tall
though
he
never
seemed
it
before
but
oh
he
was
tall
six
foot
four
or
taller
he
filled
the
room
his
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
but
he
put
on
a
smile
for
her
thanks
suzanne
it
was
really
good
to
see
you
again
i
see
you
in
florida
she
stood
up
and
moved
quickly
to
him
stood
on
tiptoe
to
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
hug
him
fiercely
he
hugged
her
back
and
she
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
i
see
you
in
florida
she
said
and
then
he
was
gone
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
and
waited
for
tears
but
they
did
come
so
she
picked
up
her
laptop
and
started
to
work
through
her
mountain
of
email
when
she
saw
him
again
he
was
coming
down
the
drive
leading
to
the
shantytown
and
the
factory
she
was
having
tea
in
the
that
had
opened
in
a
corkscrew
spire
high
above
the
rest
of
the
shantytown
the
lady
who
operated
it
called
herself
mrs
torrence
and
she
was
exquisitely
antique
but
by
no
means
frail
and
when
she
worked
the
ropes
on
her
dumbwaiter
to
bring
up
supplies
from
the
loading
area
on
the
ground
her
biceps
stood
at
attention
like
popeye
there
was
a
rumor
that
mrs
torrence
used
to
be
a
man
or
still
was
under
her
skirts
but
suzanne
did
pay
attention
to
it
lester
came
down
the
drive
grinning
and
bouncing
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
perry
had
evidently
been
expecting
him
for
he
came
racing
through
the
shantytown
and
pelted
down
the
roadway
and
threw
himself
at
lester
grabbing
him
in
a
crazy
exuberant
whooping
hug
francis
gimped
out
a
moment
later
and
gave
him
a
solemn
handshake
she
blogged
their
meeting
in
detroit
so
if
francis
and
perry
knew
about
lester
transformation
they
found
out
without
hearing
it
from
her
she
finished
recording
the
homecoming
from
mrs
torrence
crow
nest
then
paid
the
grinning
old
bag
and
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
hurrying
to
catch
up
with
lester
and
his
crowd
lester
accepted
her
hug
warmly
but
distantly
letting
go
a
fraction
of
a
second
before
she
did
she
did
let
it
get
to
her
he
had
drawn
a
crowd
now
with
francis
protege
in
the
innermost
circle
and
he
was
recounting
the
story
of
his
transformation
he
had
them
as
spellbound
as
a
roomful
of
ewoks
listening
to
shit
why
do
we
sell
that
stuff
jason
said
he
taken
a
real
interest
in
the
business
end
of
their
printer
project
too
much
competition
lester
said
there
are
already
a
dozen
shops
tooling
up
to
make
bathtub
versions
of
the
therapy
here
in
america
hundreds
more
in
eastern
europe
there
just
wo
be
any
profit
in
it
by
the
time
we
get
to
market
getting
thin
on
the
going
to
be
hell
all
it
takes
to
do
it
is
the
stuff
you
use
for
a
meth
lab
you
can
buy
all
that
in
a
kit
from
a
catalog
jason
nodded
but
looked
unconvinced
suzanne
took
lester
return
as
her
cue
to
write
about
his
transformation
she
snapped
more
pics
of
him
added
some
video
he
gave
her
ten
minutes
description
of
the
therapies
he
undergone
and
named
a
price
for
the
therapy
that
was
substantially
lower
than
a
couple
weeks
at
a
hollywood
and
far
more
effective
the
response
was
amazing
every
tv
in
the
greater
miami
area
made
a
pilgrimage
to
their
factory
to
film
lester
working
in
a
tight
over
a
printer
wrangling
huge
vats
of
goop
in
the
sun
with
sweat
beading
over
his
big
straining
biceps
her
message
boards
exploded
it
seemed
that
a
heretofore
unsuspected
contingent
of
her
growing
readership
was
substantially
obese
and
they
had
friends
lester
eventually
gave
up
on
posting
just
so
he
could
get
some
work
done
they
had
the
printers
to
the
point
where
they
could
turn
out
new
printers
but
the
whole
system
was
temperamental
and
needed
careful
nursing
lester
was
more
interested
in
what
people
had
to
say
on
the
engineering
than
chatting
with
the
fatties
the
fatties
were
skeptical
and
hopeful
in
equal
measures
the
big
fight
was
over
whether
there
was
anything
to
this
whether
lester
would
keep
the
weight
off
whether
the
new
skinny
lester
was
really
lester
whether
he
undergone
surgery
or
had
his
stomach
stapled
america
wallets
had
been
cleaned
out
by
so
many
peddlers
with
a
cure
for
obesity
that
no
one
could
believe
what
they
saw
no
matter
how
much
they
wanted
to
lord
but
it
was
bringing
in
the
readers
not
to
mention
the
advertising
dollars
the
clearing
price
for
a
thousand
ads
targeted
to
affluent
obese
was
over
fifty
bucks
as
compared
with
her
customary
cpm
of
three
bucks
a
thou
inside
of
a
week
she
made
enough
to
buy
a
car
it
was
weird
being
her
own
circulation
and
department
but
it
was
as
hard
as
worried
it
might
be
and
it
was
intensely
satisfying
to
have
such
a
understanding
of
the
economics
of
her
production
you
should
go
lester
told
her
as
she
clicked
him
through
her
earnings
spreadsheet
jesus
this
is
insane
you
know
that
these
fatties
actually
follow
me
around
on
the
net
now
asking
me
questions
in
message
boards
about
engineering
the
board
moderators
are
asking
me
to
post
under
an
assumed
name
madame
your
public
has
spoken
there
is
a
dire
need
for
your
skills
in
st
petersburg
go
they
have
chandeliers
in
the
subways
and
caviar
on
tap
all
the
blini
you
can
eat
bear
steaks
she
shook
her
head
and
slurped
at
the
tea
he
brought
her
joking
it
all
mafiyeh
there
scary
stuff
besides
i
covering
this
beat
right
now
new
work
new
work
is
going
anywhere
suzanne
we
be
here
when
you
get
back
and
this
story
is
one
that
needs
your
touch
solving
problems
it
the
same
story
you
been
covering
here
but
with
a
different
angle
take
that
money
and
buy
yourself
a
ticket
to
st
petersburg
and
spend
a
couple
weeks
on
the
job
you
clean
up
they
could
use
the
publicity
too
someone
to
go
and
drill
down
on
which
clinics
are
legit
and
which
ones
are
you
perfect
for
the
gig
i
do
know
she
said
she
closed
her
eyes
taking
big
chances
had
gotten
her
this
far
and
it
would
take
her
farther
she
knew
the
world
was
your
oyster
if
you
could
stomach
a
little
risk
yeah
she
said
yeah
hell
yeah
you
totally
right
lester
zasterovyeh
what
you
said
it
cheers
he
said
you
need
to
know
that
if
you
going
to
make
time
in
petrograd
let
me
go
send
some
email
and
get
you
set
up
you
book
a
ticket
and
just
like
that
she
was
off
to
russia
lester
insisted
that
she
buy
a
ticket
and
she
discovered
to
her
bemusement
that
british
airways
had
about
three
classes
above
business
presumably
with
even
more
exclusive
classes
reserved
to
royalty
and
peers
of
the
realm
she
luxuriated
in
fourteen
hours
of
reclining
seats
and
warm
peanuts
and
connectivity
running
a
brief
videoconference
with
lester
just
because
she
could
tjan
had
sent
her
a
guide
to
the
hotels
and
she
opted
for
the
pribaltiyskaya
a
crumbling
of
spectacular
vegasesque
dimensions
the
facade
revealed
the
tragedy
of
the
ussr
unrequited
with
concrete
as
did
the
cracks
running
up
the
walls
of
the
lobby
they
checked
her
into
the
hotel
with
the
nosiest
questionnaire
ever
a
on
government
stationary
that
demanded
to
know
her
profession
employer
city
of
birth
details
of
family
and
so
forth
an
american
businessman
next
to
her
at
the
counter
saw
her
puzzling
over
it
just
make
stuff
up
he
said
i
always
write
that
i
come
from
fake
street
anytown
california
and
that
i
work
as
a
professional
they
do
check
on
it
except
maybe
the
mob
when
they
figuring
out
who
to
mug
first
time
in
russia
it
shows
huh
you
get
used
to
it
he
said
i
come
here
every
month
on
business
you
just
need
to
understand
that
if
it
seems
ridiculous
and
too
bad
to
be
true
it
is
they
have
lots
of
rules
here
but
no
one
follows
just
ignore
any
unreasonable
request
and
you

nice
eyes
and
no
wedding

whole
night

drink
the
and
do

the
streets

stared
blankly
at
him
drugs
sure

tonight

sleep
one
in
the
morning
to
wake
up
and
do
it
again
tomorrow
and

for
the
first
couple
days
melatonin

the
counter
even

the
states
and
modafinil
practically
legal
i

extra
here
he
dug
in
his
travel
bag
and
came
up
with
some
generic
walgreens
bottles
that
ok
she
said
handing
her
credit
card
to
a
pretty
young
clerk
thanks
though
he
shook
his
head
it
your
funeral
he
said
is
way
worse
for
you
than
this
stuff
it
over
the
counter
stateside
i
leave
home
without
it
anyway
i
in
room
if
it
two
in
the
morning
and
you
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
regretting
it
call
me
and
i
send
some
down
was
he
hitting
on
her
christ
she
was
so
tired
she
could
barely
see
straight
there
was
no
way
she
was
going
to
need
any
help
getting
to
sleep
she
thanked
him
again
and
rolled
her
suitcase
across
the
cavernous
lobby
with
its
gigantic
chandeliers
and
to
the
elevators
but
sleep
did
come
the
network
connection
cost
a
fortune
something
she
had
seen
in
years
and
the
number
of
worms
and
probes
bouncing
off
her
firewall
was
astronomical
the
connection
was
slow
and
frustrating
come
she
was
indeed
staring
at
the
ceiling
would
you
take
drugs
offered
by
a
stranger
in
a
hotel
lobby
they
were
in
a
for
chrissakes
how
bad
could
they
be
she
picked
up
the
on
the
chipped
bedstand
and
punched
his
hotel
room
lo
oh
christ
i
woke
you
up
she
said

room

a
melatonin
now
and
a
modafinil
for

sweatski
uh
she
had
thought
about
giving
a
strange
man
her
room
number
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
she
said
thanks
geoff
he
said

thanks
tip
the
porter

euro
or

couple
bucks
do
bother
with
rubles
oh
she
said
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
her
last
visit
overseas
she
forgotten
how
much
minutiae
was
involved
he
hung
up
she
put
on
a
robe
and
waited
the
porter
took
about
fifteen
minutes
and
handed
her
a
little
envelope
with
two
pills
in
it
he
was
about
fifteen
with
a
bad
mustache
and
bad
skin
and
bad
teeth
that
he
displayed
when
she
handed
him
a
couple
of
dollar
bills
a
minute
later
she
was
back
on
the
phone
which
one
is
which
little
white
one
is
melatonin
that
for
now
my
bad
she
saw
him
again
in
the
breakfast
room
loading
a
plate
with
eggs
potato
pancakes
the
ubiquitous
caviar
salami
and
cheeses
in
his
other
hand
he
balanced
a
vat
of
porridge
with
strawberry
jam
and
enough
dried
fruit
to
keep
a
parrot
zoo
happy
for
a
month
how
do
you
keep
your
girlish
figure
if
you
eat
like
that
she
said
settling
down
at
his
table
ah
that
a
professional
matter
he
said
and
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
discuss
bizniz
before
i
had
two
cups
of
coffee
he
poured
himself
a
cup
of
decaf
this
is
number
two
she
picked
her
way
through
her
cornflakes
and
fruit
salad
i
always
feel
like
i
do
get
my
money
worth
out
of
buffet
breakfasts
she
said
do
worry
he
said
i
make
up
for
you
he
pounded
his
coffee
and
poured
another
cup
humanity
returns
he
said
rubbing
his
thighs
marthter
the
creature
waketh
he
said
in
high
igor
she
laughed
you
are
really
into
uh
are
you
she
said
i
am
a
firm
believer
in
better
living
through
chemistry
he
said
he
pounded
another
coffee
ahhh
coffee
and
modafinil
are
an
amazing
combo
she
taken
hers
that
morning
when
the
alarm
got
her
up
she
been
so
tired
that
it
actually
made
her
feel
nauseated
to
climb
out
of
bed
but
the
modafinil
was
getting
her
going
she
knew
a
little
about
the
drug
and
figured
that
if
the
tsa
approved
it
for
use
by
commercial
pilots
it
could
be
that
bad
for
you
so
my
girlish
figure
i
work
for
a
firm
that
has
partners
here
in
petersburg
who
work
on
pharma
products
including
some
stuff
the
fda
is
dragging
its
heels
on
despite
widespread
acceptance
in
many
nations
this
one
included
one
of
these
is
a
pill
that
overclocks
your
metabolism
i
been
on
it
for
a
year
now
and
even
though
i
am
a
stone
calorie
freak
and
pack
away
five
or
six
thousand
calories
a
day
i
do
gain
an
ounce
i
actually
have
to
remember
to
eat
enough
so
that
my
ribs
do
start
showing
suzanne
watched
him
gobble
another
thousand
calories
is
it
healthy
compared
to
what
being
fat
yes
running
ten
miles
a
day
and
eating
a
balanced
diet
of
organic
fruit
and
nuts
no
but
when
the
average
american
gets
the
majority
of
her
calories
from
is
a
pretty
loaded
term
it
reminded
her
of
that
talk
with
lester
a
lifetime
ago
in
the
ihop
slowly
she
found
herself
telling
him
about
lester
story
wait
a
second
you
suzanne
new
work
church
san
jose
mercury
news
church
she
blushed
you
ca
have
heard
of
me
she
said
he
rolled
his
eyes
sure
i
your
name
off
the
form
and
did
a
background
check
on
you
last
night
just
so
i
could
chat
you
up
over
breakfast
it
was
a
joke
but
it
gave
her
a
funny
feeling
kidding
i
kidding
i
been
reading
you
for
freaking
i
followed
lester
story
in
detail
professional
interest
you
the
voice
of
our
generation
woman
i
be
a
philistine
if
i
did
read
your
column
you
not
making
me
any
less
embarrassed
you
know
it
took
an
effort
of
will
to
keep
from
squirming
he
laughed
hard
enough
to
attract
stares
all
right
i
spend
the
night
googling
you
better
if
that
the
alternative
i
take
famous
i
suppose
she
said
you
here
writing
about
the
weight
loss
clinics
then
yes
she
said
it
was
a
secret
but
she
had
actually
gone
out
of
her
way
to
mention
it
after
all
there
might
not
be
any
kind
of
story
after
all
and
somewhere
in
the
back
of
her
mind
was
the
idea
that
she
did
want
to
tip
off
some
newsroom
to
send
out
its
own
investigative
team
and
get
her
scoop
that
is
fantastic
he
said
that
just
wow
that
the
best
news
i
had
all
year
you
taking
an
interest
in
our
stuff
it
going
to
really
push
it
over
the
edge
you
think
that
selling
to
americans
would
be
easy
but
not
if
it
involves
any
kind
of
travel
percent
of
those
lazy
insular
fucks
do
even
have
passports
ha
do
quote
that
ha
ha
she
said
do
worry
i
wo
look
how
about
this
meet
in
the
lobby
around
nine
after
dinner
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
an
interview
she
had
gone
from
intrigued
to
flattered
to
with
this
guy
and
besides
she
had
her
first
clinic
visit
scheduled
for
ten
and
it
was
coming
up
on
nine
and
who
knew
what
a
russian
looked
like
oh
ok
but
you
got
to
let
me
schedule
you
for
a
visit
to
some
of
our
clinics
and
plants
just
to
see
what
a
professional
shop
we
run
here
no
places
like
you
get
if
you
just
picked
the
top
google
adword
really
places
better
even
a
lot
of
our
doctors
come
over
from
sweden
and
denmark
to
get
out
from
under
the
socialist
medicine
systems
there
they
run
a
tight
ship
ya
shore
you
betcha
he
delivered
this
last
in
a
broad
swedish
um
she
said
it
all
depends
on
scheduling
let
sort
it
out
tonight
ok
ok
he
said
ca
he
stood
up
with
her
and
gave
her
a
long
handshake
it
a
real
honor
to
meet
you
suzanne
you
one
of
my
real
heros
you
know
that
um
she
said
again
thanks
geoff
he
seemed
to
sense
that
he
come
on
too
strong
he
looked
like
he
was
about
to
apologize
that
really
kind
of
you
to
say
she
said
it
be
good
to
catch
up
tonight
he
brightened
it
was
easy
enough
to
be
kind
after
all
she
had
the
front
desk
call
her
a
taxi
she
been
repeatedly
warned
off
of
gypsy
cabs
and
any
vehicle
that
one
procured
by
means
of
a
wandering
tout
she
got
into
the
back
had
the
doorman
repeat
the
directions
to
lester
clinic
twice
to
the
cabbie
watched
him
switch
on
the
meter
and
checked
the
tariff
then
settled
in
to
watch
st
petersburg
go
flying
by
she
switched
on
her
phone
and
watched
it
struggle
to
associate
with
a
russian
network
they
were
on
the
road
for
all
of
five
minutes
long
enough
to
note
the
looming
bulk
of
the
hermitage
and
the
ripples
left
by
official
cars
slicing
through
the
traffic
with
their
blue
blinking
lights
when
her
phone
went
nutso
she
looked
at
it
she
had
ten
texts
half
a
dozen
voicemails
a
dozen
new
clipped
articles
and
it
was
ringing
with
a
number
in
new
york
she
bumped
the
new
york
call
to
voicemail
she
did
recognize
the
number
besides
if
the
world
had
come
to
an
end
while
she
was
asleep
she
wanted
to
know
some
details
before
she
talked
to
anyone
about
it
she
paged
back
through
the
texts
in
reverse
chronological
the
last
five
were
increasingly
panicked
messages
from
lester
and
perry
then
one
from
tjan
then
one
from
kettlebelly
they
all
wanted
to
discuss
the
news
whatever
that
was
one
from
her
old
editor
at
the
merc
asking
if
she
was
available
for
comment
about
the
news
tjan
too
the
first
one
was
from
freddy
that
snake
kodacell
creditors
calling
in
debts
share
price
below
one
cent
imminent
nasdaq
comments
her
stomach
went
cold
her
breakfast
congealed
into
a
hard
lump
the
clipped
articles
had
quotes
from
kettlewell
we
will
see
to
it
that
all
our
employees
are
paid
our
creditors
are
reimbursed
and
our
shareholders
are
through
an
orderly
perry
fuck
it
i
was
doing
this
shit
before
kodacell
do
expect
to
stop
now
and
lester
it
was
too
beautiful
and
cool
to
be
real
i
guess
where
she
was
mentioned
it
was
usually
in
a
snide
context
that
made
her
out
to
be
a
disgraced
pitchwoman
for
a
failed
movement
which
she
was
basically
her
phone
rang
kettlewell
hi
kettlewell
she
said
where
have
you
been
he
said
he
sounded
really
edgy
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
in
california
i
in
st
petersburg
she
said
in
russia
i
only
found
out
about
ten
seconds
ago
what
happened
oh
christ
who
knows
cascading
failure
fell
short
of
last
estimates
which
started
a
slide
then
a
couple
lawsuits
filed
then
some
unfavorable
press
the
share
price
kept
falling
and
things
got
worse
your
basic
clusterfuck
but
you
guys
had
great
numbers
overall
sure
if
you
looked
at
them
our
way
they
were
great
if
you
looked
at
them
the
way
the
street
looks
at
them
we
were
in
deep
shit
analysts
could
figure
out
how
to
value
us
add
a
little
market
chaos
and
some
old
assholes
like
that
fucker
freddy
and
it
a
wonder
we
lasted
as
long
as
we
did
they
already
calling
us
the
twenty
first
century
enron
kettlewell
she
said
i
lived
through
a
couple
of
these
and
something
not
right
when
the
dotcoms
were
going
under
their
ceos
kept
telling
everyone
everything
was
all
right
right
up
to
the
last
minute
they
did
throw
in
the
towel
they
stood
like
captains
on
the
bridge
of
sinking
ships
so
so
what
going
on
here
it
sounds
like
you
whipped
why
you
fighting
there
were
lots
of
dotcoms
that
tanked
but
a
few
of
those
ceos
pulled
it
off
restructured
and
came
out
of
it
alive
why
are
you
giving
up
suzanne
oh
suzanne
he
laughed
but
it
was
a
happy
laugh
you
think
that
this
happened
overnight
you
think
that
this
problem
just
cropped
up
yesterday
and
i
tossed
in
the
towel
oh
oh
yeah
we
been
tanking
for
months
i
been
standing
on
the
bridge
of
this
sinking
ship
with
my
biggest
smile
pasted
on
for
two
consecutive
quarters
now
i
thrown
out
the
most
impressive
reality
distortion
field
the
business
world
has
ever
seen
just
because
giving
up
does
mean
i
gave
up
without
a
fight
suzanne
had
never
been
good
at
condolences
she
hated
funerals
landon
i
sorry
it
must
have
been
very
hard
yeah
he
said
well
sure
i
wanted
you
to
have
the
scoop
on
this
but
i
had
to
talk
to
the
press
once
the
story
broke
you
understand
i
understand
she
said
scoops
are
that
important
anyway
tell
you
what
i
post
a
short
piece
on
this
right
away
just
saying
it
true
and
i
getting
details
then
i
do
interviews
with
you
and
lester
and
perry
and
put
up
something
longer
in
a
couple
of
hours
does
that
work
he
laughed
again
no
humor
in
it
yeah
that
be
sorry
kettlewell
no
no
he
said
no
it
look
i
just
want
to
write
about
this
in
a
way
that
honors
what
you
done
over
the
past
two
years
i
never
been
present
at
the
birth
of
anything
remotely
this
important
it
deserves
to
be
described
well
it
sounded
like
he
might
be
crying
there
was
a
snuffling
sound
you
been
amazing
suzanne
we
could
have
done
it
without
you
no
one
could
have
described
it
better
great
deeds
are
irrelevant
if
no
one
knows
about
them
or
remembers
them
her
phone
was
beeping
she
snuck
a
peek
it
was
her
old
editor
listen
she
said
i
have
to
go
there
a
call
coming
in
i
to
take
i
can
call
you
right
back
do
he
said
it
ok
i
busy
here
anyway
this
is
a
big
day
his
laugh
was
like
a
dog
bark
take
care
of
yourself
kettlewell
she
said
do
let
the
bastards
grind
you
down
nil
carborundum
illegitimis
to
you
too
she
clicked
over
to
her
editor
jimmy
she
said
long
time
no
speak
sorry
i
missed
your
calls
before
i
in
russia
on
a
story
hello
suzanne
he
said
his
voice
had
an
odd
strained
quality
or
maybe
that
was
just
her
mood
projecting
i
sorry
suzanne
been
doing
good
work
the
best
work
of
your
career
if
you
ask
me
i
follow
it
closely
it
made
her
feel
a
little
better
she
been
uncomfortable
about
the
way
she
and
jimmy
had
parted
ways
but
this
was
vindicating
it
emboldened
her
jimmy
what
the
hell
do
i
do
now
christ
suzanne
i
do
know
i
tell
you
what
not
to
do

record
off
the
record

do
what

done

hang
grimly
onto
the
last
planks
from
the
sinking
ship
chronicling
the
last
few
struggling
sinking
schmucks
demise
it
no
fun
being
the
stenographer
for
the
fall
of
a
great
empire
find
something
else
to
cover
the
words
made
her
heart
sink
poor
jimmy
stuck
there
in
the
newsroom
while
the
world
crumbled
around
him
it
must
have
been
heartbreaking
thanks

said

want
an
interview

no
woman
i
not
a
ghoul
i
wanted
to
call

make
sure

of
thing
from
our
newsroom
anymore
just
local
stuff
national
coverage
comes
from
the
wires
or
from
the
mcclatchy
national
newsroom
she
sucked
in
air
could
it
be
possible
her
first
thought
when
jimmy
called
was
that
she
made
a
terrible
mistake
by
leaving
the
merc
but
if
this
was
what
the
paper
had
come
to
she
had
left
just
in
time
even
if
her
own
was
sinking
it
had
kept
her
afloat
for
a
while
the
offer
still
stands
jimmy
i
talk
to
anyone
you
want
to
assign
you
a
sweetheart
suzanne
what
are
you
in
russia
for
she
told
him
screw
scoops
anyway
not
like
jimmy
was
going
to
send
anyone
to
he
could
even
afford
to
dispatch
a
reporter
to
marin
county
by
the
sounds
of
things
what
a
story
he
said
man
yeah
she
said
yeah
i
guess
it
is
you
suzanne
this
is
the
single
most
important
issue
in
practically
every
american
life
there
is
one
in
a
thousand
who
does
worry
endlessly
about
his
weight
well
i
have
been
getting
really
good
numbers
on
this
she
named
the
figure
he
sucked
air
between
his
teeth
that
what
the
whole
freaking
does
on
a
top
story
suzanne
you
outperforming
fifty
local
papers
yeah
hell
yeah
he
said
maybe
i
should
ask
you
for
a
job
when
he
got
off
the
phone
she
spoke
to
perry
and
then
to
lester
lester
said
that
he
wanted
to
go
traveling
and
see
his
old
friends
in
russia
and
that
if
she
was
still
around
in
a
couple
weeks
maybe
he
see
her
there
perry
was
morose
and
grimly
determined
he
was
on
the
verge
of
shipping
his
printers
and
he
was
sure
he
could
do
it
even
if
he
did
have
the
kodacell
network
for
marketing
and
logistics
he
did
even
seem
to
register
it
when
she
told
him
that
she
was
going
to
be
spending
some
time
in
russia
then
she
had
to
go
into
the
clinic
and
ask
intelligent
questions
and
take
pictures
and
record
audio
and
jot
notes
and
pay
attention
to
the
small
details
so
that
she
would
be
able
to
write
the
best
account
possible
they
dressed
well
in
russia
in
the
clinics
business
casual
but
well
tailored
and
made
from
good
material
the
europeans
knew
from
textiles
and
expert
tailoring
seemed
to
be
in
cheap
supply
here
she
have
to
get
someone
to
run
her
up
a
blue
blazer
and
a
white
shirt
and
a
decent
skirt
it
would
be
nice
to
get
back
into
clothes
after
a
couple
years
worth
of
florida
casual
she
see
geoff
after
dinner
that
night
get
more
detail
for
the
story
there
was
something
big
here
in
the
medical
tourism
angle
not
just
weight
loss
but
gene
therapy
too
and
voodoo
stuff
and
advanced
prostheses
and
even
some
crazy
performance
enhancement
stuff
that
had
kept
russia
out
of
the
past
olympics
she
typed
her
story
notes
and
answered
the
phone
calls
one
special
call
she
returned
once
she
was
sitting
in
her
room
relaxed
with
a
cup
of
coffee
from
the
hello
freddy
she
said
suzanne
darling
he
sounded
like
he
was
breathing
hard
what
can
i
do
for
you
just
wanted
a
quote
love
something
for
color
oh
i
got
a
quote
for
you
she
given
the
quote
a
lot
of
thought
living
with
the
squatters
had
broadened
her
vocabulary
magnificently
and
those
are
your
good
points
she
said
taking
a
sip
of
coffee
goodbye
freddy
part
ii
the
drive
from
orlando
down
to
hollywood
got
worse
every
time
sammy
took
it
the
turnpike
tolls
went
up
every
year
and
the
road
surface
quality
declined
and
the
gas
prices
at
the
were
when
sammy
started
at
disney
imagineering
a
decade
before
the
company
had
covered
your
actual
expenses
just
collect
the
receipts
and
turn
them
in
for
cash
back
but
since
parks
had
been
spun
off
into
a
separate
company
with
its
own
shareholders
the
new
austerity
measures
meant
that
the
in
burbank
set
a
maximum
reimbursement
and
never
mind
the
actual
expense
enough
of
this
competitive
intelligence
work
and
sammy
would
go
broke
off
the
turnpike
it
was
even
worse
the
shantytowns
multiplied
and
multiplied
laundry
lines
stretched
out
in
the
of
former
every
clogged
with
aggressive
vendors
the
squeegee
bums
of
the
century
with
their
pornographic
animatronic
dollies
and
infinitely
varied
robot
dogs
disney
world
still
sucked
in
a
fair
number
of
tourists
though
not
nearly
so
many
as
in
its
golden
day
but
they
were
staying
away
from
miami
in
droves
the
snowbirds
had
died
off
in
a
great
demographic
spasm
over
the
past
decade
and
their
children
lacked
the
financial
wherewithal
to
even
think
of
in
their
parents
condos
the
area
around
the
dead
was
particularly
awful
the
shanties
here
rose
three
even
four
stories
into
the
air
clustered
together
to
make
medieval
broward
county
had
long
since
stopped
enforcing
the
property
claims
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
that
managed
the
interests
of
the
former
owners
of
the
fields
and
malls
that
had
been
turned
into
the
new
towns
by
the
time
he
pulled
into
the
enormous
parking
lot
the
day
had
heated
up
his
had
conked
and
he
accumulated
a
of
urchins
who
wanted
to
sell
him
a
bust
of
himself
in
the
style
of
a
roman
emperor
they
worked
on
affiliate
commission
for
some
printer
jerk
in
the
shanties
and
they
had
a
real
aggressive
pitch
practically
flinging
their
samples
at
him
he
pushed
past
them
and
wandered
through
the
market
stalls
a
kind
of
cruel
parody
of
the
florida
these
gypsies
sold
fabricated
parts
that
could
be
modded
to
make
zip
guns
bongs
wireless
antennae
they
sold
fruit
smoothies
and
suspicious
beef
jerky
they
sold
bootleg
hardcopies
of
mexican
fotonovelas
and
bound
printouts
of
japanese
comics
it
was
all
damnably
and
intriguing
even
though
sammy
knew
that
it
was
all
junk
finally
he
reached
the
in
front
of
the
and
slapped
down
five
bucks
on
the
counter
the
guy
behind
the
counter
was
the
kind
of
character
that
kept
the
tourists
away
from
florida
with
one
cockeyed
eyebrow
that
looked
like
a
set
of
hills
a
beard
and
skin
tanned
like
wrinkled
leather
hi
again
sammy
said
brightly
working
at
disney
taught
you
to
talk
happy
even
when
your
stomach
was
crawling
the
castmember
grin
back
again
the
guy
behind
the
counter
laughed
he
was
missing
a
canine
tooth
and
it
made
him
look
even
more
sketchy
christ
dude
we
have
to
invent
a
season
pass
for
you
just
ca
stay
away
sammy
said
you
not
the
only
one
you
a
hell
of
a
customer
for
the
ride
but
you
have
got
anything
on
some
of
the
people
i
get
here
people
who
come
practically
every
day
it
flattering
i
tell
you
you
made
this
then
yeah
he
said
swelling
up
with
a
little
puff
of
pride
me
and
lester
over
there
he
gestured
at
a
fit
greying
man
sitting
on
a
stool
before
a
small
cocktail
bar
built
into
a
scavenged
orange
julius
stand
god
knew
where
these
people
got
all
their
crap
from
he
had
the
look
of
one
of
the
fatkins
unnaturally
thin
and
muscled
and
yet
somehow
lazy
the
combination
of
a
ten
kilocalorie
diet
zero
and
muscle
enhancers
ten
years
ago
he
would
have
been
a
model
but
today
he
was
just
another
with
a
serious
food
habit
time
was
that
disney
world
was
from
all
the
powered
wheelchairs
carting
around
morbidly
obese
americans
who
could
walk
from
ride
to
ride
but
these
days
it
looked
more
like
an
ad
for
a
gymnasium
full
of
generically
buff
fatkins
in
clothes
good
work
he
said
again
in
castmemberese
you
should
be
very
proud
the
proprietor
smiled
and
took
a
long
pull
off
a
straw
hooked
into
the
distiller
beside
him
go
on
get
in
there
flatterer
sammy
stepped
through
the
glass
doors
and
found
himself
in
an
cave
of
seemingly
infinite
dimension
the
old
had
been
the
size
of
five
football
fields
and
a
cunning
arrangement
of
curtains
and
baffles
managed
to
convey
all
that
space
without
revealing
its
contents
before
him
was
the
ride
vehicle
in
a
single
shaft
of
spotlight
gingerly
he
stepped
into
it
the
design
was
familiar
there
had
been
a
glut
of
these
things
before
the
fatkins
movement
took
hold
wheelchairs
that
used
to
pitch
yaw
stand
and
sit
in
a
perpetual
controlled
fall
the
disney
world
veterans
of
their
heyday
remembered
them
as
behemoths
that
you
needed
a
forklift
to
budge
when
they
died
but
the
ride
people
had
done
something
to
improve
on
the
design
these
things
performed
as
well
as
the
originals
though
they
were
certainly
were
these
cats
shelling
out
fifty
grand
a
pop
for
the
real
deal
the
upholstered
seat
puffed
clouds
of
dust
into
the
spotlight
shaft
as
he
settled
into
the
chair
and
did
up
his
the
little
lcd
set
into
the
control
panel
lit
up
and
started
to
play
the
standard
video
spiel
narrated
in
grizzled
welcome
to
the
cabinet
of
wonders
there
was
a
time
when
america
held
out
the
promise
of
a
new
way
of
living
and
working
the
new
work
boom
of
the
teens
was
a
period
of
unparalleled
invention
a
cambrian
explosion
of
creativity
not
seen
since
the
time
of
edison
and
unlike
edison
the
people
who
invented
the
new
work
revolution
were
artists
and
frauds
their
marvelous
inventions
emerged
at
the
rate
of
five
or
six
per
week
some
danced
some
sang
some
were
helpmeets
and
some
were
mere
jesters
today
nearly
all
of
these
wonderful
things
have
vanished
with
the
collapse
of
new
work
they
ended
up
back
in
the
trash
heaps
that
inspired
them
here
in
the
cabinet
of
wonders
we
are
preserving
these
last
remnants
of
the
golden
age
a
single
beacon
of
light
in
a
time
of
darkness
as
you
move
through
the
ridespace
please
remain
seated
however
you
may
pause
your
vehicle
to
get
a
closer
look
by
moving
the
joystick
toward
yourself
pull
the
joystick
up
to
cue
narration
about
any
object
move
the
joystick
to
the
left
towards
the
if
you
think
an
item
is
ugly
unworthy
or
misplaced
move
the
joystick
to
the
right
toward
the
if
you
think
an
item
is
particularly
pleasing
your
feedback
will
be
factored
into
the
continuous
rearrangement
of
the
cabinet
which
takes
place
on
a
basis
driven
by
the
robots
you
may
see
crawling
around
the
floor
of
the
cabinet
the
ride
lasts
between
ten
minutes
and
an
hour
depending
on
how
often
you
pause
please
enjoy
yourself
and
remember
when
we
were
golden
this
business
was
new
to
him
it
had
been
a
mere
four
days
since
he
been
up
here
but
like
so
many
other
of
his
visits
they
made
major
rehabs
to
their
ride
in
the
amount
of
time
it
would
have
taken
imagineering
to
write
a
memo
about
the
possibility
of
holding
a
meeting
he
velcroed
his
camera
wireless
eye
to
his
lapel
tapped
the
preset
to
correct
for
low
light
and
motion
and
hit
the
joystick
the
wheelchair
stood
up
with
wobbly
grace
and
began
to
roll
forward
on
two
wheels
heeling
over
precipitously
as
it
cornered
into
the
main
space
of
the
ride
the
gyros
could
take
it
he
knew
but
it
still
thrilled
him
the
way
that
a
fast
did
miles
away
from
the
safe
rides
back
in
disney
the
chair
screeched
around
a
corner
and
pulled
into
the
first
scene
a
diorama
littered
with
cars
each
one
was
kitted
out
with
different
crazy
technologies
dashboard
gods
that
monitored
and
transmitted
traffic
heuristics
autopilots
boxes
even
an
amphibious
retrofit
on
a
little
hybrid
that
apparently
worked
converting
the
little
bug
into
a
the
chair
swooped
around
each
one
pausing
while
the
narration
played
back
reminisces
by
the
inventors
or
sometimes
by
the
owners
of
the
old
gizmos
the
stories
were
pithy
and
sweet
and
always
funny
these
were
artifacts
scavenged
from
the
first
days
of
a
better
nation
that
had
died
then
on
to
the
kitchen
and
the
bathrooms
bathroom
after
bathroom
with
better
toilets
better
showers
better
tubs
better
floors
and
better
lights
bedrooms
kids
rooms
one
after
another
a
hyper
museum
the
decor
was
miles
ahead
of
where
it
had
been
the
last
time
he
been
through
there
were
lots
of
weird
like
taxidermied
alligators
vintage
tourist
pennants
chintz
lamps
and
tiny
dioramae
of
action
figures
he
paused
in
front
of
a
fabric
printer
surrounded
by
custom
tees
and
knit
caps
and
figurines
from
bright
yarns
and
was
passed
by
another
chair
in
it
was
a
cute
woman
in
her
thirties
shaggy
hair
luminous
in
the
spotlight
over
the
she
paused
her
chair
and
lovingly
reached
out
to
set
down
a
pair
of
appliqued
shorts
with
organic
leds
pulsing
and
swirling
around
the
waistband
give
it
a
ok
these
were
my
best
sellers
she
said
smiling
a
dazzling
smile
at
him
she
wheeled
away
and
paused
at
the
next
diorama
to
set
down
a
in
a
child
room
diorama
wow
they
were
getting
content
in
the
holy
crap
he
finished
out
the
ride
with
a
keen
hand
on
the
lever
carefully
voting
for
the
best
stuff
and
against
the
stuff
that
looked
out
of
place
like
a
pornographic
ceramic
bong
that
someone
had
left
in
the
midst
of
a
clockwork
animatronic
made
from
stuffed
animals
then
it
was
over
and
he
was
debarking
in
what
had
been
the
garden
center
the
new
bright
sun
made
him
tear
up
and
he
fished
out
his
shades
hey
mister
i
got
something
better
than
sunglasses
for
you
the
guy
who
beckoned
him
over
to
a
had
the
look
of
an
aging
bangbanger
shaved
head
tattoos
ridiculous
cycling
shorts
with
some
gut
hanging
over
them
see
these
polarizing
prescription
or
optically
neutral
everyone
in
india
is
into
these
things
but
we
make
right
here
in
florida
he
lifted
a
of
filmy
plastic
from
his
case
and
peeled
back
his
eyelid
and
popped
it
in
his
whole
iris
was
tinted
black
along
with
most
of
the
whites
of
his
eyes
geometric
shapes
like
maori
tattoos
were
rendered
in
charcoal
grey
across
the
lenses
i
can
print
you
up
a
set
in
five
minutes
ten
bucks
for
plain

sealed
package

that
as
good
as
going
to
get
before
sammy
knew
it
he
was
taking
receipt
of
a
sealed
plastic
packet
in
hot
pink
with
a
perforated
strip
down
one
side
uh
thanks
he
said
as
he
began
to
tuck
it
into
a
pocket
he
hated
he
was
no
good
at
them
it
was
why
he
bought
all
his
cars
online

once

fall
in
love
with
they
safe
man
go
on
it
easy
just
like
putting
in
a
big
contact
lens
sammy
thought
about
just
walking
away
but
the
other
vendors
were
watching
him
now
and
the
scrutiny
sapped
his
will
my
hands
are
too
dirty
for
this
he
said
the
vendor
silently
passed
him
a
sealed
sterile
wipe
grinning
knowing
he
was
had
he
wiped
his
hands
tore
open
the
package
took
out
the
lenses
and
popped
them
one
at
a
time
into
his
eyes
he
blinked
a
couple
times
the
world
was
solarized
and
grey
like
he
was
seeing
it
through
a
tinted
windscreen
oh
man
you
look
the
vendor
said
he
held
up
a
hand
mirror
sammy
looked
his
eyes
were
shiny
black
beads
like
a
mouse
eyes
solid
save
for
a
subtle
tracery
of
mickey
mouse
heads
at
the
corners
the
trademark
infringement
made
him
grin
hard
and
spitless
he
looked
ten
years
younger
like
those
hipsters
whose
parents
dragged
them
to
walt
disney
world
who
showed
up
in
bangbanger
threads
and
sneered
and
scratched
their
groins
and
made
loud
remarks
about
how
suckballs
it
all
was
his
conservative
looked
more
like
a
thing
and
his
round
cheeks
made
him
boyish
those
are
good
for
two
days
tops
your
eyes
start
getting
itchy
you
just
toss
you
want
a
pair
that
good
for
a
week
twenty
dollah
with
the
mickeys
i
got
donalds
and
astro
boys
and
all
kinds
of
shit
just
have
a
look
through
my
flash
book
some
stuff
i
drew
myself
even
playing
along
now
sammy
let
himself
be
led
on
a
tour
of
the
which
featured
the
kind
of
art
he
was
accustomed
to
seeing
in
tattoo
parlor
windows
skulls
and
snakes
and
scorpions
and
naked
ladies
mickey
mouse
giving
the
finger
daisy
duck
with
a
minnie
mouse
as
a
dominatrix
the
company
offered
a
bounty
for
turning
in
trademark
infringers
but
somehow
he
doubted
that
the
company
lawyers
would
be
able
to
send
this
squatter
a
letter
in
the
end
he
bought
one
of
each
of
the
disney
sets
you
like
the
mouse
huh
sure
he
said
i
never
been
too
expensive
this
is
all
the
ride
i
want
right
here
he
gestured
at
the
dead
you
like
that
huh
man
it
cool
i
go
on
that
sometimes
just
to
see
what
it
turned
into
i
like
that
it
always
different
and
i
like
that
people
add
their
own
stuff
it
makes
me
feel
you
know
what
suddenly
the
vendor
dropped
his
bangbanger
facade
those
were
the
best
days
of
my
life
i
was
building
printers
making
them
run
my
older
brother
liked
to
fix
cars
and
so
did
my
old
man
but
who
needs
a
car
where
you
going
to
go
the
stuff
i
built
man
it
could
make
i
do
know
why
or
how
it
ended
but
while
it
was
going
i
felt
like
the
king
of
the
goddamned
world
it
felt
less
fun
and
ironic
now
there
were
tears
bright
on
the
vendor
eyes
he
was
in
his
younger
than
he
seemed
at
first
if
he
been
dressed
like
a
suburban
he
would
have
looked
like
someone
smart
and
accomplished
with
lively
features
and
clever
hands
sammy
felt
obscurely
ashamed
oh
he
said
well
i
spent
those
years
working
a
straight
job
so
it
did
really
touch
me
that
your
loss
man
the
vendor
said
the
printer
behind
him
was
spitting
out
the
last
of
sammy
in
sealed
plastic
wrap
the
vendor
wrapped
them
up
and
put
them
in
a
brown
bag
sammy
plodded
through
the
rest
of
the
market
with
his
paper
bag
it
was
all
so
depressing
the
numbers
at
disney
world
were
down
way
down
and
it
was
his
job
to
figure
out
how
to
bring
them
up
again
without
spending
too
much
money
he
done
it
before
a
couple
of
times
with
the
stuff
and
with
the
rebuild
of
fantasyland
as
an
ironic
goth
hangout
being
a
wholly
separate
entity
from
the
old
walt
disney
company
had
its
advantages
but
to
do
it
a
third
time
christ
he
had
no
idea
how
he
get
there
these
squatters
had
seemed
promising
but
could
you
possibly
transplant
something
like
this
to
a
professional
entertainment
product
the
urchins
were
still
in
the
parking
lot
with
their
roman
emperor
busts
he
held
his
hands
out
to
ward
them
off
and
found
himself
holding
onto
a
bust
of
his
own
head
one
of
the
little
rats
had
gotten
a
scan
of
his
head
while
he
was
walking
by
and
had
made
the
bust
on
spec
he
looked
older
in
roman
emperor
guise
than
he
did
in
his
mind
eye
old
and
tired
like
an
emperor
in
decline
twenty
dollah
man
twenty
twenty
the
kid
said
he
was
about
and
still
chubby
with
long
hair
that
frizzed
away
from
his
head
in
a
dandelion
halo
ten
sammy
said
clutching
his
tired
head
it
was
smooth
as
epoxy
resin
and
surprisingly
light
there
was
a
lot
of
different
goop
you
could
run
through
those
printers
but
whatever
they
used
for
this
it
was
featherweight
the
kid
looked
shrewd
twenty
dollah
and
i
get
rid
of
these
other
kids
ok
sammy
laughed
he
passed
the
kid
a
twenty
taking
care
to
tuck
his
wallet
deep
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
jacket
the
kid
whistled
shrilly
and
the
rest
of
the
kids
melted
away
the
entrepreneur
made
the
twenty
disappear
tapped
the
side
of
his
nose
and
took
off
running
back
into
the
market
stalls
it
was
hot
and
muggy
and
sammy
was
tired
and
the
drive
back
to
orlando
was
another
five
hours
if
the
traffic
was
against
him
and
these
days
everything
was
against
him
perry
funny
eyebrow
twitched
as
he
counted
out
the
day
take
this
gig
was
all
cream
all
profit
his
overheads
amounted
to
a
couple
hundred
a
month
to
jason
and
his
crew
to
help
with
the
robot
and
machinery
maintenance
in
the
half
that
to
some
of
the
shantytown
girls
to
dust
and
sweep
after
closing
and
a
retainer
to
a
bangbanger
pack
that
ran
security
at
the
ride
and
in
the
market
plus
he
got
the
rents
and
so
when
the
day
was
over
only
the
first
hundred
bucks
out
of
the
till
went
into
overheads
and
the
rest
split
with
lester
lester
waited
impatiently
watching
him
count
twice
before
splitting
the
stack
perry
rolled
up
his
take
and
dropped
it
into
a
hidden
pocket
sewn
into
his
cargo
shorts
someday
you
going
to
get
lucky
and
some
chick
is
going
to
reach
down
and
freak
out
buddy
lester
said
better
she
finds
my
than
my
prostate
perry
said
lester
spent
a
lot
of
time
thinking
about
getting
lucky
making
up
for
a
lifetime
of
bad
luck
with
girls
ok
let
get
changed
lester
said
as
usual
he
was
wearing
jeans
that
owed
a
little
debt
to
the
bangbanger
cycling
shorts
something
you
would
have
had
to
go
to
a
gay
bar
to
see
when
perry
was
in
college
his
shirt
clung
to
his
pecs
and
was
tailored
down
to
his
narrow
waist
it
was
a
fatkins
style
the
kind
of
thing
you
could
wear
unless
you
had
a
uniquely
adversarial
relationship
with
your
body
and
metabolism
no
lester
no
perry
said
i
said
i
go
on
this
double
date
with
you
but
i
did
say
anything
about
letting
you
dress
me
up
for
it
the
two
girls
were
a
pair
that
lester
had
met
at
a
fatkins
club
in
south
beach
the
week
before
and
he
their
pic
to
perry
with
a
scrawled
drunken
note
about
which
one
was
his
they
were
attractive
enough
but
the
monotonic
fatkins
devotion
to
sybartism
was
so
tiresome
perry
did
see
much
point
in
hooking
up
with
a
girl
he
could
have
a
good
technical
discussion
with
come
it
good
stuff
you
love
it
if
i
have
to
change
clothes
i
not
interested
perry
folded
his
arms
in
truth
he
was
interested
period
he
liked
his
little
kingdom
there
and
he
could
get
everything
he
needed
from
burritos
to
ram
at
the
market
he
had
a
chest
freezer
full
of
bankruptcy
sale
organic
mres
for
variety
just
the
shirt
then
i
had
it
printed
just
for
you
perry
raised
his
funny
eyebrow
let
see
it
lester
turned
to
his
latest
car
a
trike
with
huge
electric
blue
back
tires
and
popped
the
trunk
rummaged
and
proudly
emerged
holding
a
bright
blue
print
shirt
lester
are
those
turds
it
transgressivist
moderne
lester
said
hopping
from
foot
to
foot
saw
it
in
the
new
york
times
brought
the
pic
to
gabriela
in
the
market
she
cloned
it
printed
it
and
sent
it
out
for
stitching
an
extra
ten
buck
for
service
i
am
wearing
a
shirt
covered
in
steaming
piles
of
shit
lester
no
no
no
a
googol
times
no
lester
laughed
christ
i
had
you
going
did
i
do
worry
i
would
actually
have
let
you
go
out
in
public
wearing
this
but
how
about
he
said
with
a
flourish
and
brought
out
another
shirt
something
stretchy
and
iridescent
like
an
it
was
sleeveless
it
really
work
with
your
biceps
and
pecs
also
looks
pretty
good
compared
to
the
turd
shirt
does
it
go
on
try
it
on
lester
banks
you
are
the
gayest
straight
man
i
know
perry
said
he
shucked
his
sweaty
tee
and
slipped
into
the
shirt
lester
gave
him
a
big
he
examined
his
reflection
in
the
glass
doors
of
the
yeah
ok
he
said
let
get
this
over
with
your
enthusiasm
your
best
feature
lester
said
their
dates
were
two
brunettes
with
deep
tans
and
cosmetic
contacts
that
hid
their
pupils
in
favor
of
featureless
expanses
of
white
so
they
looked
like
their
eyes
had
rolled
back
into
their
heads
or
maybe
like
they
were
wearing
for
glass
eyes
like
most
of
the
fatkins
girls
perry
had
met
they
dressed
to
the
nines
ate
like
pigs
drank
like
fishes
and
talked
about
nothing
but
biotech
so
i
thinking
sure
mitochrondrial
lengthening
like
it
should
work
but
if
that
so
why
have
we
been
screwing
around
with
it
for
thirty
years
without
accomplishing
anything
his
date
moira
worked
at
a
law
office
and
she
came
up
to
his
chest
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
with
those
eyes
but
it
seemed
like
she
was
totally
oblivious
to
his
complete
indifference
to
mitochondria
he
nodded
and
tried
not
to
look
bored
south
beach
was
what
it
had
once
been
or
maybe
perry
had
changed
he
used
to
love
to
come
here
to
but
the
weirdos
of
south
beach
seemed
too
precious
when
compared
with
the
denizens
of
his
own
little
settlement
out
on
the
hollywood
freeway
let
go
for
a
walk
on
the
beach
lester
said
digging
out
his
wallet
and
rubbing
his
card
over
the
on
the
table
good
idea
perry
said
anything
to
get
off
this
patio
and
away
from
the
insufferable
club
music
thundering
out
of
the
speakers
directly
over
their
table
the
beach
was
gorgeous
so
there
was
that
the
sunset
behind
them
stained
the
ocean
bloody
and
the
sand
was
fine
and
clean
around
their
feet
dade
county
beachcombers
wormed
endlessly
through
the
sand
filtering
out
all
the
gunk
cig
butts
condoms
needles
wrappers
loose
change
wedding
rings
and
forgotten
sunglasses
perry
nudged
one
with
his
toe
and
it
roombaed
away
following
its
instinct
to
avoid
human
contact
how
do
you
figure
they
keep
the
vags
from
busting
those
open
for
whatever
they
got
in
their
bellies
perry
said
looking
over
his
date
head
at
lester
who
was
holding
hands
with
his
girl
carrying
her
shoes
in
his
free
hand
huh
oh
those
things
are
built
like
tanks
have
to
be
to
keep
the
sand
out
you
need
about
four
hours
with
an
to
bust
one
open
you
tried
it
lester
laughed
who
me
now
it
was
perry
date
turn
to
be
bored
she
wandered
away
toward
the
boardwalk
with
its
strip
of
novelty
sellers
perry
followed
because
he
had
a
professional
interest
in
the
kind
of
wares
they
carried
most
of
them
originated
on
one
of
his
printers
after
all
plus
it
was
the
gentlemanly
thing
to
do
what
have
we
here
he
said
as
he
pulled
up
alongside
her
she
was
trying
on
a
bracelet
of
odd
bony
beads
ectopic
fetuses
she
said
you
know
like
the
christian
fundies
use
for
research
you
quicken
an
unfertilized
egg
in
vitro
and
you
get
a
little
ball
of
fur
and
bone
and
skin
and
it
can
never
be
a
human
so
it
has
no
soul
so
it
not
murder
to
harvest
them
the
vendor
a
turkish
teenager
with
a
luxurious
mustache
nodded
every
bead
made
from
naturally
occurring
he
handed
one
to
perry
it
was
dry
and
fragile
in
his
hand
the
bones
were
warm
and
porous
and
in
tortured
elephant
man
shapes
that
he
recoiled
from
atavistically
good
price
the
turkish
kid
said
he
had
practically
no
accent
at
all
and
was
wearing
a
japanese
uniform
and
thoroughly
americanized
look
here
he
said
and
gestured
at
a
little
corner
of
his
table
it
was
covered
in
roses
made
from
fabric
small
and
crude
with
perry
picked
one
up
it
had
a
certain
naive
charm
the
fabric
was
some
kind
of
very
delicate
leather
it
skin
his
date
said
foetal
skin
he
dropped
it
his
fingers
tingled
with
the
echo
of
the
feeling
of
the
leather
i
hate
the
rose
fluttered
past
the
table
to
the
sandy
boardwalk
and
the
turkish
kid
picked
it
up
and
blew
it
clean
sorry
perry
said
sticking
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
date
bought
a
bracelet
and
a
matching
choker
made
of
tiny
bones
and
teeth
and
the
turkish
kid
leering
helped
her
fasten
the
necklace
when
they
returned
to
lester
and
his
date
perry
knew
the
evening
was
at
a
close
the
girls
played
a
couple
rounds
of
unreadable
behind
their
lenses
and
perry
shrugged
apologetically
at
lester
well
then
lester
said
it
sure
has
been
a
nice
night
lester
got
smooched
when
they
saw
the
girls
off
in
a
pedicab
in
the
buzz
and
hum
of
its
flywheel
perry
got
a
damp
and
unenthusiastic
handshake
win
some
lose
some
lester
said
as
the
girls
rolled
away
in
a
flash
of
muscular
calves
from
the
pair
of
cabbies
pedaling
the
thing
you
not
angry
perry
said
nah
lester
said
i
get
laid
too
much
as
it
is
saps
me
of
my
precious
bodily
fluids
got
ta
keep
some
chi
inside
you
know
perry
raised
up
his
funny
eyebrow
and
made
it
dance
oh
ok
lester
said
you
got
me
i
meeting
mine
later
after
she
drops
her
friend
off
i
get
a
cab
home
then
shall
i
take
my
car
lester
said
i
get
a
ride
back
in
the
morning
no
way
you
get
a
taxi
to
take
you
to
our
neighborhood
at
this
hour
perry
car
had
been
up
on
blocks
for
a
month
awaiting
his
attention
to
its
failing
brakes
and
mushy
steering
so
it
was
nice
to
get
behind
the
wheel
of
lester
big
daddy
roth
trike
and
give
it
a
little
gas
out
on
the
interstate
the
smell
of
the
swamp
and
biodiesel
from
the
big
rigs
streaming
past
the
windscreen
the
road
was
dark
and
treacherous
with
potholes
but
perry
got
into
the
rhythm
of
it
and
found
he
did
want
to
go
home
quite
so
he
kept
driving
into
the
night
he
told
himself
that
he
was
scouting
dead
malls
for
future
expansion
but
he
had
kids
who
the
status
of
all
the
likely
candidates
in
the
hood
and
he
kept
tabs
on
his
choicest
morsels
via
daily
sat
photos
that
he
subscribed
to
in
his
morning
feed
what
the
hell
was
he
doing
with
his
life
the
ride
was
a
lark
it
had
been
lester
idea
but
lester
had
lost
interest
and
perry
had
done
most
of
the
work
they
were
quite
squatting
the
perry
paid
rent
to
a
state
commission
that
collected
in
escrow
for
the
absentee
landlord
it
was
a
fine
life
but
the
days
blurred
one
into
the
next
directionless
building
the
ride
had
been
fun
setting
up
the
market
had
been
fun
but
running
them
well
he
might
as
well
be
running
a
laundromat
for
all
the
mental
acuity
his
current
job
required
you
miss
it
he
said
to
himself
over
the
whistle
of
the
wind
and
the
hiss
of
the
fat
on
the
rear
tires
you
want
to
be
back
in
the
shit
inventing
stuff
making
it
all
happen
for
the
hundredth
time
he
thought
about
calling
suzanne
church
he
missed
her
too
and
not
just
because
she
made
him
famous
and
now
he
was
no
longer
famous
she
put
it
all
in
perspective
for
him
and
egged
him
on
to
greater
things
she
been
their
audience
and
all
performed
for
her
back
in
the
golden
days
it
was
what
in
russia
or
was
it
two
in
the
afternoon
he
had
her
number
on
his
but
he
never
rang
it
he
did
know
what
he
tell
her
he
could
call
tjan
or
even
kettlebelly
just
ring
them
out
of
the
blue
veterans
together
shooting
the
shit
maybe
they
could
have
a
kodacell
reunion
and
get
together
to
sing
the
company
song
wearing
the
company
he
pulled
the
car
off
at
a
truck
stop
and
bought
an
novelty
from
a
vending
machine
with
a
robotic
claw
that
scooped
the
mushed
it
into
the
cone
then
gave
it
a
haircut
so
that
it
looked
like
astro
boy
head
then
extended
the
cone
on
a
robotic
claw
it
made
him
smile
someone
had
invented
this
thing
it
could
have
been
him
he
knew
where
you
could
download
libraries
and
libraries
he
knew
where
you
could
get
plans
for
the
robotics
and
motors
and
sensors
christ
these
days
he
had
a
good
idea
where
you
could
get
the
wholesale
and
which
crooked
interests
he
have
to
grease
to
get
his
stuff
into
he
was
thirty
four
years
old
he
was
single
and
childless
and
he
was
eating
an
in
a
deserted
at
two
in
the
morning
by
the
side
of
a
freeway
in
south
florida
he
bossed
a
tourist
attraction
and
he
ran
a
pirate
what
the
hell
was
he
doing
with
his
life
getting
mugged
that
what
they
came
out
of
the
woods
near
the
picnic
tables
four
bangbangers
but
young
ones
in
their
early
teens
two
had
guns
nothing
fancy
just
run
off
a
mill
somewhere
in
an
industrial
park
you
saw
them
all
over
the
place
easy
as
pie
to
make
but
the
ammo
was
a
lot
harder
to
come
by
so
maybe
they
were
unloaded
speaking
of
unloaded
he
was
about
to
piss
his
pants
wallet
one
of
them
said
he
had
a
bad
mustache
that
reminded
him
of
the
turkish
kid
on
the
beach
probably
the
same
hormones
that
gave
kids
mustaches
gave
them
bad
ideas
like
selling
fetus
jewelry
or
sticking
up
people
by
the
machines
at
late
night
keys
he
said
phone
he
added
perry
slowly
set
down
the
cone
on
the
lid
of
the
beside
him
he
only
eaten
one
spike
off
head
his
vision
telescoped
down
so
that
he
was
looking
at
that
kid
at
his
mustache
at
the
gun
in
his
hands
he
was
reaching
for
his
wallet
slowly
he
need
to
hitch
a
ride
back
to
town
canceling
the
would
be
tough
since
he
stored
all
the
passwords
and
numbers
in
his
phone
which
they
were
about
to
take
off
him
and
he
have
to
cancel
the
phone
for
that
matter
do
you
have
an
older
brother
named
jason
his
mouth
said
while
his
hands
were
still
being
mugged

stall
by
the
ride
selling
contact
lenses
the
kid
eyes
narrowed

to
know
me

for
your
health

his
hands
were
passing
over
his
phone
his
wallet
his
keys
lester

be
glad

an
excuse
to

like
him
the
kid
three
buddies
were
beginning
their
slow
fade
into
the
background
the
kid
was
visibly
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
the
gun
wavered
perry
knees
turned
to
water
you
that
guy
the
kid
said
he
peered
closer

said
his
mouth
was
so
smart

who
mugged

the
kid
said
the
gun
wavered
wavered
come
one
of
his
buddies
said

in
a
minute
the
kid
said
his
voice
flat
perry
knew
he
was
a
dead
man
i

the
kid
said
once
his
friends
were
out
of
range
me
too
said
perry

wo
tell
my
brother
perry
froze
time
dilated
he
realized
that
his
fists
were
clenched
so
tight
that
his
knuckles
hurt
he
realized
that
he
had
a
zit
on
the
back
of
his
neck
that
was
rubbing
against
his
collar
he
realized
that
the
kid
had
a
paperback
book
stuck
in
the
waistband
of
his
bangbanger
shorts
which
was
unusual
it
was
a
fantasy
novel
a
conan
novel
wow
time
snapped
back
i
wo
tell
your
brother
he
said
then
he
surprised
himself
but
you
got
to
give
me
back
the
and
leave
the
car
at
the
market
in
the
morning
the
kid
nodded
then
he
seemed
to
realize
he
was
holding
a
gun
on
perry
he
lowered
it
yeah
that
fair
he
said
ca
use
the
fucking
cards
these
days
anyway
yeah
perry
said
well

cash
there
anyway
he
realized
he
had
five
hundred
bucks
in
a
roll
in
a
hidden
pocket
in
his
shorts
you
get
home
ok
i
thumb
a
ride
perry
said
i
can
call
you
a
taxi
the
kid
said
it
not
safe
to
hang
around
here
that
really
nice
of
you
perry
said
thanks
the
kid
took
out
a
little
phone
and
prodded
it
for
a
minute
on
the
way
he
said
the
guns
are
loaded
oh
well
perry
said
good
to
know
an
awkward
silence
spread
between
them
look
i
really
sorry
the
kid
said
we
do
really
do
this
it
our
first
night
my
brother
would
really
kill
me
i
wo
tell
him
perry
said
his
heart
was
beating
again
not
thundering
or
keeping
ominously
still
but
you
know
this
smart
you
going
to
stick
someone
up
who
has
bullets
and
he
gon
na
shoot
you
we
get
ammo
the
kid
said
and
shoot
him
that
only
a
little
better
you
know
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
the
kid
said
looking
young
and
petulant
i
apologized
come
by
tomorrow
with
the
car
and
let
talk
all
right
lester
did
even
notice
that
his
car
was
missing
until
the
kid
drove
up
with
it
and
when
he
asked
about
it
perry
just
raised
his
funny
eyebrow
at
him
that
funny
eyebrow
it
had
the
power
to
cloud
minds
what
your
name
perry
asked
the
kid
giving
him
the
spare
stool
by
the
it
was
after
lunch
time
when
the
punishing
heat
slowed
everyone
to
a
sticky
crawl
and
the
crowd
was
thin
one
or
two
customers
every
half
hour
glenn
the
kid
said
in
full
daylight
he
looked
older
perry
had
noticed
that
the
shantytowners
never
stopped
dressing
like
teenagers
wearing
the
fashions
of
their
youths
forever
so
that
a
walk
through
the
market
was
like
a
tour
through
the
teen
fashions
of
the
last
thirty
years
glenn
you
did
me
a
real
solid
last
night
glenn
squirmed
on
his
stool
i
sorry
about
that
me
too
perry
said
but
not
as
sorry
as
i
might
have
been
you
said
it
was
your
first
night
is
that
true
sure
the
kid
said
but
you
get
into
other
shit
do
you
mugging
selling
a
little
dope
something
like
that
everyone
does
that
glenn
said
he
looked
sullen
maybe
perry
said
and
then
a
lot
of
them
end
up
doing
a
stretch
in
a
sometimes
they
get
bit
by
and
do
come
out
sometimes
one
of
the
other
prisoners
hits
them
over
the
head
with
a
shovel
sometimes
you
just
lose
three
to
five
years
of
your
life
to
digging
ditches
glenn
said
nothing
i
not
trying
to
tell
you
how
to
run
your
life
perry
said
but
you
seem
like
a
decent
kid
so
i
figure
there
more
in
store
for
you
than
getting
killed
or
locked
up
i
know
that
pretty
normal
around
here
but
you
do
have
to
go
that
way
your
brother
did
what
the
fuck
do
you
know
about
it
anyway
the
kid
was
up
now
body
language
saying
he
wanted
to
get
far
away
fast
i
could
ask
around
the
market
perry
said
as
though
the
kid
spoken
someone
here
has
got
to
be
looking
for
someone
to
help
out
you
could
open
your
own
stall
the
kid
said
it
all
just
selling
junk
to
idiots
what
kind
of
job
is
that
for
a
man
selling
people
stuff
they
ca
be
bothered
to
make
for
themselves
is
a
way
of
making
a
living
there
used
to
be
professional
portrait
photographers
who
take
a
pic
of
your
family
for
money
they
were
even
considered
artists
besides
you
do
have
to
sell
stuff
you
download
you
can
invent
stuff
and
print
that
get
over
it
those
days
are
over
no
one
cares
about
inventions
anymore
it
nailed
perry
between
the
eyes
like
a
slaughterhouse
bolt
yeah
yeah
he
said
he
did
want
to
talk
to
this
kid
any
more
than
this
kid
wanted
to
talk
to
him
well
if
i
ca
talk
you
out
of
it
your
own
business
he
started
to
rearrange
his
the
kid
saw
his
opportunity
for
freedom
and
bolted
he
was
probably
headed
for
his
brother
stall
and
then
the
long
walk
to
wherever
he
planned
on
spending
his
day
everything
was
a
long
walk
from
here
or
you
could
wait
for
the
busses
that
ran
on
the
hour
during
perry
checked
out
the
car
cleaned
out
the
empties
and
the
roaches
and
twists
from
the
back
seat
then
parked
it
a
couple
more
people
came
by
to
ride
his
ride
and
he
took
their
money
lester
had
just
finished
his
mechanical
computer
it
snaked
back
and
forth
across
the
whole
of
the
old
solarium
sheets
of
pressboard
with
gears
mounted
on
aviation
bearings
francis
had
helped
him
with
those
all
day
he
been
listening
to
the
racket
of
it
grinding
through
its
mighty
calculations
dumping
carloads
of
m
ms
into
its
output
hopper
you
programmed
it
with
regulation
baseballs
footballs
and
wiffleballs
dump
them
in
the
input
hopper
and
they
would
be
sorted
into
the
correct
chutes
to
trigger
the
operations
with
a
whopping
one
kilobit
of
memory
the
thing
could
best
any
of
the
early
vacuum
tube
computers
without
a
single
electrical
component
and
lester
was
ready
to
finally
declare
victory
over
the
cursed
univac
perry
let
himself
be
coaxed
into
the
deputizing
francis
to
man
the
and
watched
admiringly
as
lester
put
the
machine
through
its
paces
you
done
it
perry
said
well
i
got
ta
blog
it
lester
said
run
some
benchmarks
really
test
it
out
against
the
old
monsters
i
thinking
of
using
it
to
the
old
nazi
enigma
code
that
show
those
dirty
nazi
bastards
we
win
the
war
yet
perry
found
himself
giggling
you
the
best
man
he
said
to
lester
it
good
that
there
at
least
one
sane
person
around
here
do
flatter
yourself
perry
i
was
talking
about
lester
lester
said
he
scooped
a
double
handful
of
brown
m
ms
up
from
the
output
hopper
and
munched
them
it
not
a
good
sign
when
you
start
accusing
me
of
being
the
grownup
in
our
partnership
have
some
m
ms
and
tell
me
about
it
perry
did
unburdening
himself
to
his
old
pal
his
roommate
of
ten
years
the
guy
he
gone
to
war
with
and
started
businesses
with
and
collaborated
with
you
restless
perry
lester
said
he
put
nine
a
ball
and
another
nine
golf
balls
in
the
machine
input
hopper
two
and
a
third
seconds
later
eighty
one
m
ms
dropped
into
the
output
hopper
you
just
you
a
maker
and
running
things
instead
of
making
things
no
one
cares
about
made
things
anymore
les
that
sort
of
true
lester
said
i
allow
you
that
but
only
sort
of
true
what
you
missing
is
how
much
people
care
about
organizations
still
that
was
the
really
important
thing
about
the
new
work
the
way
we
could
all
come
together
to
execute
without
a
lot
of
management
the
bangbanger
arms
dealers
the
and
fatkins
suppliers
they
all
run
on
social
institutions
that
we
perfected
back
then
you
got
something
like
that
here
with
your
market
a
fluid
social
institution
that
you
could
have
had
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
if
you
say
so
perry
said
the
m
ms
were
giving
him
heartburn
cheap
chocolate
did
really
agree
with
his
stomach
i
do
and
so
the
answer
is
staring
you
right
in
the
face
go
invent
some
social
institutions
you
got
one
creeping
up
here
in
the
ride
there
are
little
blogospheres
of
fans
who
coordinate
what
they
going
to
bring
down
and
where
they
going
to
put
it
build
on
that
no
one
going
to
haul
ass
across
the
country
to
ride
this
ride
les
get
real
course
not
lester
beamed
at
him
i
got
one
word
for
you
man
franchise
franchise
build
dupes
of
this
thing
print
out
anything
that
a
one
of
a
kind
run
them
as
franchises
wo
work
perry
said
like
you
said
this
thing
works
because
of
the
hardcore
of
volunteer
curators
who
add
their
own
stuff
to
it
it
always
different
those
franchises
would
all
be
static
or
would
diverge
it
just
be
boring
compared
to
this
why
should
they
diverge
why
should
they
be
static
you
could
network
them
dude
what
happens
in
one
happens
in
all
the
curators
just
be
updating
one
exhibit
but
all
of
them
thousands
of
them
millions
of
them
a
gigantic
physical
wiki
oh
it
be
so
very
very
very
cool
perry
a
cool
institution
why
do
you
do
it
i
gon
na
but
i
need
someone
to
run
the
project
someone
who
good
at
getting
people
all
pointed
in
the
same
direction
you
pal
my
hero
on
this
stuff
you
such
a
flatterer
you
love
it
baby
lester
said
and
fluttered
his
long
eyelashes
like
the
lady
said
to
the
stamp
collector
philately
will
get
you
everywhere
oy
perry
said
you
fired
you
ca
fire
me
i
a
volunteer
lester
dropped
six
and
a
heavy
medicine
ball
down
the
hopper
the
machine
ground
and
chattered
then
started
dropping
of
m
ms
then
some
change
what
operation
was
that
perry
said
he
never
seen
lester
pull
out
the
medicine
ball
figure
it
out
lester
said
perry
thought
for
a
moment
six
squared
six
cubed
log
six
six
my
god
you
weird
les
genius
is
never
appreciated
he
scooped
up
a
of
brown
m
ms
in
your
face
von
neumann
let
see
your
precious
eniac
top
a
month
later
perry
was
clearing
security
at
miami
international
looking
awkward
in
long
trousers
shoes
and
a
denim
jacket
it
was
autumn
in
boston
and
he
could
show
up
in
and
a
pair
of
cutoffs
the
security
guards
gave
his
leathery
lopsided
face
a
hard
look
he
grinned
like
a
pirate
and
made
his
funny
eyebrow
twitch
a
stunt
that
earned
him
half
an
hour
behind
the
screen
and
a
date
with
doctor
jellyfinger
what
exactly
do
you
think
i
got
hidden
up
there
he
asked
as
he
gripped
the
railing
and
tried
not
to
let
the
illegitimati
carborundum
it
procedure
sir
well
the
doc
said
my
prostate
was
the
size
of
a
guava
about
a
month
ago
in
your
professional
opinion
has
it
shrunk
or
grown
i
mean
while
you
up
there
the
tsa
man
did
like
that
at
all
a
minute
later
perry
was
buckling
up
and
leaving
the
little
room
with
an
exaggerated
bowlegged
gait
he
tipped
an
imaginary
hat
at
the
guard
retreating
back
and
said
call
me
in
a
stagey
voice
it
was
the
last
bit
of
fun
he
had
for
the
next
four
hours
crammed
in
the
tin
can
full
of
recycled
discount
flatulence
and
the
clatter
of
fingers
on
keyboards
and
the
gabble
of
a
hundred
phone
conversations
as
the
salarymen
on
the
flight
stole
a
few
minutes
of
cramped
productivity
from
the
dead
travel
time
touching
down
in
boston
and
getting
his
luggage
he
felt
like
landed
on
an
alien
planet
the
feeling
of
disorientation
and
foreignness
was
new
to
perry
he
was
used
to
being
supremely
comfortable
in
control
confident
but
he
was
nervous
now
maybe
even
scared
a
little
he
dialed
tjan
i
got
my
bags
he
said
i
be
right
around
tjan
said
really
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
there
were
more
cops
than
passengers
in
the
arrivals
area
at
logan
and
they
watched
tjan
warily
as
he
pulled
up
and
swung
open
a
door
of
his
little
what
the
fuck
is
this
a
porsche
perry
said
as
he
folded
himself
awkwardly
into
the
front
seat
stepping
in
through
the
pulling
his
bag
down
into
his
lap
after
him
it
a
lada
i
had
it
imported
they
all
over
russia
evolutionary
algorithm
used
to
produce
a
chassis
it
nice
to
see
you
perry
it
nice
to
see
you
tjan
he
said
the
car
was
so
low
to
the
ground
that
it
felt
like
he
was
riding
luge
tjan
hammered
mercilessly
on
the
gearbox
rocketing
them
to
cambridge
at
such
speed
that
perry
barely
had
time
to
admire
the
foliage
except
at
they
were
around
the
campus
now
taking
a
screeching
right
off
mass
ave
onto
a
street
of
homely
brick
houses
tjan
pulled
up
in
front
of
one
and
popped
the
the
cold
air
that
rushed
in
was
as
crisp
as
an
apple
unlike
any
breath
of
air
to
be
had
in
florida
where
there
was
always
a
mushiness
a
feeling
of
air
that
had
been
filtered
through
the
moist
lungs
of
florida
teeming
fauna
perry
climbed
out
of
the
little
russian
and
twisted
his
back
and
raised
his
arms
over
his
head
until
his
spine
gave
and
popped
and
crackled
tjan
followed
and
then
he
shut
down
the
car
with
a
remote
that
made
it
go
through
an
impressive
and
stylish
series
of
clicks
clunks
and
chirps
before
settling
down
over
its
wheels
dropping
the
chassis
to
a
centimeter
off
the
ground
come
on
he
said
i
show
you
your
room
tjan
porch
sagged
with
a
couple
kids
bikes
to
it
and
an
chalk
mosaic
over
every
inch
of
it
the
wood
creaked
and
gave
beneath
their
feet
the
door
sprang
open
and
revealed
a
pretty
little
girl
nine
or
ten
years
old
in
and
a
hoodie
sweater
that
went
nearly
to
her
ankles
the
long
sleeves
bunched
up
like
on
her
forearms
the
hood
hung
down
to
her
butt
it
was
east
coast
bangbanger
as
reinterpreted
through
the
malls
daddy
she
said
and
put
her
arms
around
tjan
waist
squeezing
hard
he
pried
her
loose
and
then
hoisted
her
by
the
armpits
up
to
what
have
you
done
to
your
brother
nothing
he
did
deserve
she
said
with
a
smile
that
showed
dimples
and
made
her
little
nose
wrinkle
tjan
looked
over
at
perry
this
is
my
daughter
lyenitchka
who
is
about
to
be
locked
in
the
coal
cellar
until
she
learns
to
stop
torturing
her
younger
brother
lyenitchka
this
is
perry
gibbons
upon
whom
you
have
already
made
an
irreparably
bad
first
impression
he
shook
her
gently
perrywards
hello
perry
she
said
giggling
holding
out
one
hand
she
had
a
faint
accent
which
made
her
sound
like
a
tiny
skinny
bond
villainess
he
shook
gravely
nice
to
meet
you
he
said
you
got
your
kids
perry
said
once
she
was
gone
for
the
school
year
me
and
the
ex
we
had
a
about
the
russian
education
system
and
ended
up
here
i
get
the
kids
from
september
to
june
but
not
christmases
or
easter
holidays
she
gets
them
the
rest
of
the
time
and
takes
them
to
a
family
dacha
in
ukraine
where
she
assures
me
there
are
hardly
any
mafiyeh
kids
to
influence
my
darling
daughter
you
must
be
loving
this
perry
said
tjan
face
went
serious
this
is
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
i
really
happy
for
you
buddy
they
had
burgers
in
the
cooking
on
an
electric
grill
that
was
caked
with
the
smoking
grease
of
a
summer
worth
of
outdoor
meals
the
plastic
was
weighed
down
with
painted
rocks
and
the
corners
blew
up
in
the
freshening
autumn
winds
little
brother
appeared
when
the
burgers
began
to
spit
and
smoke
on
the
grill
a
in
metallic
mesh
trousers
and
shirt
wrought
with
the
logo
of
a
cartoon
cossack
holding
a
aloft
sasha
meet
perry
sasha
looked
away
then
went
off
to
swing
on
a
hanging
from
the
big
tree
you
got
good
kids
perry
said
handing
tjan
a
beer
from
the
cooler
under
the
picnic
table
yup
tjan
said
he
flipped
the
burgers
and
then
looked
at
both
of
them
lyenitchka
was
pushing
her
brother
on
the
swing
a
little
too
hard
tjan
smiled
and
looked
back
down
at
his
burgers
tjan
cut
the
burgers
in
half
and
dressed
them
to
his
kids
exacting
standards
they
picked
at
them
pushed
them
onto
each
other
plates
and
got
some
into
their
mouths
i
read
your
briefing
on
the
ride
tjan
said
once
his
kids
had
finished
and
eaten
half
a
package
of
chutney
oreos
for
dessert
pretty
weird
stuff
perry
nodded
and
cracked
another
beer
the
cool
air
was
weirding
him
out
awakening
some
atavistic
instinct
to
seek
a
cave
yup
weird
as
hell
but
they
love
it
not
just
the
geeks
either
though
they
eat
it
up
you
should
see
it
obsessive
does
begin
to
cover
it
but
the
civilians
come
by
the
hundreds
too
you
should
hear
them
when
they
come
out
i
forgotten
about
those
they
were
wicked
where
can
i
get
one
of
those
these
days
you
figger
the
nostalgia
thick
enough
to
cut
with
a
knife
tjan
nodded
i
been
going
over
your
books
but
i
ca
figure
out
if
you
profitable
sorry
that
me
i
pretty
good
at
keeping
track
of
numbers
but
getting
them
massaged
into
a
coherent
picture
yeah
i
know
tjan
got
a
look
how
you
make
out
on
kodacell
perry
enough
to
open
the
ride
buy
a
car
did
lose
anything
ah
tjan
fiddled
with
his
beer
listen
i
got
rich
off
of
westinghouse
not
rich
but
rich
enough
that
i
never
have
to
work
again
i
can
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
in
this
yard
flipping
burgers
taking
care
of
my
kids
and
looking
at
porn
well
you
were
the
suit
getting
rich
is
what
suits
do
i
just
a
grunt
tjan
had
the
good
grace
to
look
slightly
embarrassed
now
here
the
thing
i
do
to
work
but
perry
i
have
what
going
to
do
if
i
do
work
the
kids
are
at
school
all
day
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
daytime
tv
sucks
playing
the
stock
market
is
completely
nuts
it
all
gone
sideways
and
upside
down
i
got
an
education
so
i
would
to
flip
burgers
for
the
rest
of
my
life
what
are
you
saying
tjan
i
saying
yes
tjan
said
grinning
piratically
i
saying
that
i
join
your
little
hobby
business
and
i
open
another
ride
here
for
the
massholes
i
help
you
run
the
franchising
op
collect
fees
make
it
profitable
perry
felt
his
face
tighten
what
i
thought
you
be
happy
about
this
i
am
perry
said
but
you
misunderstanding
something
these
are
meant
to
be
profitable
businesses
i
done
with
that
these
are
art
or
community
or
something
they
museums
lester
calls
them
cabinets
of
wonders
there
no
franchising
op
the
way
you
talking
about
it
it
ad
hoc
it
a
protocol
we
all
agree
on
not
a
business
arrangement
tjan
grunted
i
do
think
i
understand
the
difference
between
a
protocol
and
a
business
arrangement
he
held
up
his
hand
to
fend
off
perry
next
remark
but
it
does
matter
you
can
let
people
have
the
franchise
for
free
you
can
claim
that
you
not
letting
anyone
have
anything
that
they
letting
themselves
in
for
their
franchise
it
does
matter
to
me
but
perry
here
something
you
going
to
have
to
understand
going
to
be
nearly
impossible
make
a
business
out
of
this
businesses
are
great
structures
for
managing
big
projects
like
trying
to
develop
the
ability
to
walk
without
developing
a
skeleton
once
in
a
blue
moon
you
get
an
octopus
but
for
the
most
part
you
get
skeletons
skeletons
are
good
shit
tjan
i
want
you
to
come
on
board
to
help
me
create
an
octopus
perry
said
i
can
try
tjan
said
but
it
wo
be
easy
when
you
do
cool
stuff
you
end
up
making
money
fine
perry
said
make
money
but
keep
it
to
a
minimum
ok
the
next
time
perry
turned
up
at
logan
it
was
colder
than
the
inside
of
an
icebox
and
shitting
down
grey
snow
with
the
consistency
of
frozen
custard
great
weather
for
an
opening
he
said
once
he
climbed
through
the
roof
of
tjan
car
and
gotten
snow
all
over
the
leather
upholstery
sorry
about
the
car
do
sweat
it
the
kids
are
murder
on
leather
i
should
trade
this
thing
in
on
something
that
less
of
a
deathtrap
anyway
tjan
was
balder
than
he
been
in
september
and
skinnier
he
had
a
beard
that
further
hollowed
out
his
normally
round
cheeks
the
lada
fishtailed
a
little
as
they
navigated
the
tunnels
back
toward
cambridge
the
roads
slick
and
icy
we
scored
an
excellent
location
tjan
said
i
told
you
that
but
check
this
out
they
were
right
in
the
middle
of
a
area
of
boston
something
that
felt
like
a
banking
district
with
impressive
towers
it
took
perry
a
minute
to
figure
out
what
tjan
was
pointing
at
that
the
site
there
was
a
mall
on
the
corner
with
a
boarded
up
derelict
hyatt
overtopping
it
rising
high
into
the
sky
but
right
in
the
middle
of
town
boston
not
florida
tjan
said
lots
of
people
here
do
have
cars
there
were
some
dead
malls
out
in
worcester
and
the
like
but
i
got
this
place
for
nothing
the
owners
have
paid
taxes
in
the
ten
years
since
the
hotel
folded
and
the
only
shops
that
were
left
open
were
a
couple
of
azerbaijani
guys
selling
junky
stuff
from
india
we
gutted
the
whole
second
floor
and
turned
the
into
a
there
an
old
tunnel
connecting
this
to
the
t
and
i
managed
to
get
it
so
i
expect
we
get
some
perry
marveled
tjan
had
a
suit
knack
for
pulling
off
the
ambitious
perry
had
never
tried
to
even
rent
an
apartment
in
a
big
city
figuring
that
any
place
where
land
was
at
a
premium
was
a
place
where
people
willing
to
spend
more
than
him
could
be
found
give
him
a
that
was
off
the
gps
grid
anytime
have
you
managed
to
fill
the
flea
market
it
had
taken
perry
a
long
time
to
fill
his
and
still
he
had
a
couple
of
dogs
a
tarot
reader
and
a
bong
stall
a
guy
selling
cans
and
a
discount
porn
stall
that
sold
naked
shovelware
by
the
petabyte
yeah
i
got
proteges
up
and
down
new
england
a
lot
of
them
settled
here
after
the
crash
one
place
is
as
good
as
another
and
the
housing
was
once
the
economy
disappeared
they
upped
stakes
and
came
to
boston
as
soon
as
i
put
the
word
out
i
think
waiting
for
the
next
big
thing
you
think
perry
new
work
is
the
most
important
thing
that
ever
happened
to
some
of
those
people
it
was
the
of
their
lives
it
was
the
only
time
they
ever
felt
useful
perry
shook
his
head
do
you
think
that
sad
tjan
negotiated
a
tricky
tunnel
interchange
and
got
the
car
pointed
to
cambridge
no
perry
i
do
think
it
sad
jesus
christ
you
believe
that
why
do
you
think
i
helping
you
you
and
me
and
all
the
rest
of
them
we
did
something
the
world
changed
continuing
to
change
have
you
stopped
to
think
that
one
in
five
american
workers
picked
up
and
moved
somewhere
else
to
do
new
work
projects
that
one
of
the
largest
american
resettlements
since
the
dustbowl
the
average
new
work
collective
shipped
more
inventions
per
year
than
edison
labs
at
its
peak
in
a
hundred
years
when
they
remember
the
centuries
that
were
america
they
count
this
one
among
them
because
of
what
we
made
so
no
perry
i
do
think
it
sad
i
sorry
sorry
ok
i
did
mean
it
that
way
but
it
tragic
is
it
that
the
dream
ended
that
they
all
living
out
there
in
the
boonies
thinking
of
their
glory
days
yes
that
sad
but
that
why
i
agreed
to
do
the
ride
not
to
freeze
the
old
projects
in
amber
but
to
create
a
new
project
that
we
can
all
participate
in
again
these
people
uprooted
their
lives
to
follow
us
it
the
least
we
can
do
to
give
them
something
back
for
that
perry
stewed
on
that
the
rest
of
the
way
to
tjan
staring
at
the
sleet
hand
resting
against
the
icy
sammy
checked
in
to
a
comfort
inn
tucked
into
the
storey
of
the
bank
of
america
building
in
downtown
boston
the
lobby
was
empty
the
desk
unmanned
b
of
a
was
in
receivership
and
not
doing
so
hot
at
that
as
the
fact
that
they
had
let
out
their
executive
floors
to
a
discount
testified
the
room
was
fine
though
small
and
windowless
but
fine
power
shower
toilet
and
bed
all
he
demanded
in
a
hotel
room
he
ate
the
packet
of
nuts
he
bought
at
the
airport
before
jumping
on
the
t
and
then
checked
his
email
he
had
more
of
it
than
he
could
possibly
answer
he
did
think
he
ever
had
an
empty
but
he
picked
off
anything
that
looked
important
including
a
note
from
his
who
was
now
living
in
the
keys
on
a
squatter
beach
and
wanted
to
know
if
he
could
loan
her
a
hundred
bucks
no
sense
of
how
she
pay
him
back
without
work
but
michelle
was
resourceful
and
probably
good
for
it
he
paypalled
it
to
her
feeling
like
a
sucker
for
hoping
that
she
might
repay
it
in
person
he
been
single
since
she
left
him
the
year
before
and
he
was
lonely
and
he
landed
at
two
and
by
the
time
he
was
done
with
all
the
bullshit
it
was
after
dinner
time
and
he
was
hungry
as
hell
boston
was
full
of
and
kebab
stands
that
he
passed
on
the
walk
in
and
he
hustled
out
onto
the
street
to
see
if
any
were
still
open
he
got
a
huge
garlicky
kebab
and
ate
it
in
the
lee
of
a
frozen
atm
shelter
wolfing
it
without
tasting
it
he
went
and
scouted
the
location
of
the
new
ride
he
gotten
wind
of
it
online
none
of
his
idiot
colleagues
could
be
bothered
to
read
the
public
email
lists
of
the
competitors
they
were
supposedly
in
charge
of
oppo
researching
shaking
loose
the
budget
to
get
a
discount
flight
to
boston
had
been
a
major
coup
requiring
blackmail
and
gaming
of
the
system
with
the
ridiculously
low
and
hotel
allowance
he
still
go
home
a
couple
hundred
bucks
why
did
he
even
do
his
job
he
should
just
play
by
the
rules
and
get
nothing
done
and
get
fired
or
passed
up
for
promotion
which
was
practically
the
same
thing
the
new
ride
was
in
an
impressive
urban
mall
he
spent
his
college
years
in
philly
and
had
passed
many
a
happy
day
in
malls
like
this
one
cruising
for
girls
or
camping
out
on
a
bench
with
his
books
and
a
smoothie
unlike
the
crappy
roadside
malls
of
florida
there
had
been
nothing
but
the
best
stores
in
them
the
property
values
too
high
to
make
anything
but
shops
viable
so
it
was
especially
sad
to
see
this
mall
turned
over
to
the
junky
stalls
and
junkier
ride
like
a
fat
supermodel
sentenced
to
a
appearance
for
her
shoplifting
arrests
he
approached
the
doors
with
trepidation
he
was
resolved
not
to
buy
anything
from
the
market
no
busts
or
contact
lenses
and
had
stuck
his
wallet
in
his
front
pocket
on
the
way
over
the
mall
was
like
a
sauna
he
shucked
his
jacket
and
sweater
and
hung
them
over
one
arm
the
whole
ground
floor
had
been
given
over
to
flimsy
he
skulked
among
them
trying
to
simultaneously
take
note
of
their
contents
and
avoid
their
owners
notice
he
came
to
realize
that
he
need
skulk
it
seemed
like
half
of
boston
had
turned
out
not
just
young
people
either
there
were
plenty
of
tweedy
academics
big
southie
boys
with
thick
accents
recent
immigrants
with
clothes
they
chattered
and
laughed
and
mixed
freely
and
ate
hot
food
out
of
huge
cauldrons
or
off
of
clever
electric
grills
the
smells
made
his
stomach
growl
even
though
he
just
polished
off
a
kebab
the
size
of
his
head
the
buzz
of
the
crowd
reminded
him
of
something
what
was
it
a
premiere
that
was
it
when
they
opened
a
new
ride
or
area
at
the
park
there
was
the
same
sense
of
thrilling
anticipation
of
excitement
and
eagerness
that
made
it
worse
these
people
had
no
business
being
this
excited
about
something
so
lowbrow
cheap
whatever
it
was
it
was
worthy
they
were
shopping
like
fiends
a
mother
with
a
baby
on
her
hip
pushed
past
him
her
stroller
piled
high
with
shopping
bags
screened
with
giant
pixellated
belgian
pastries
she
was
laughing
and
the
baby
on
her
hip
was
laughing
too
he
headed
for
the
escalator
whose
treads
had
been
anodized
in
bright
colors
something
he
never
seen
before
he
let
it
carry
him
upstairs
but
looked
down
and
so
he
was
nearly
at
the
top
before
he
realized
that
the
guy
from
the
florida
ride
was
standing
there
handing
out
fliers
and
staring
at
sammy
like
he
knew
him
from
somewhere
it
was
too
late
to
avoid
him
sammy
put
on
his
best
castmember
smile
hello
there
the
guy
grinned
and
wiggled
his
eyebrow
i
know
you
from
somewhere
he
said
slowly
from
florida
sammy
said
with
an
apologetic
shrug
i
came
up
to
see
the
opening
no
the
guy
had
a
huge
smile
now
looked
like
was
going
to
hug
him
you
shitting
me
what
can
i
say
i
a
fan
that
hey
tjan
come
here
and
meet
this
guy
your
name
sammy
tried
to
think
of
another
name
but
drew
a
blank
mickey
he
said
at
last
kicking
himself
tjan
this
is
mickey
he
a
regular
on
the
ride
in
florida
and
come
up
here
just
to
see
the
opening
tjan
had
short
hair
and
sallow
skin
and
dressed
like
an
accountant
but
his
eyes
were
bright
and
sharp
as
they
took
sammy
in
looking
him
up
and
down
quickly
well
that
certainly
flattering
he
reached
into
his
creased
blazer
and
pulled
out
a
slip
of
paper
have
a
couple
comp
tickets
then
the
least
we
can
do
for
your
loyalty
the
paper
was
festooned
with
holograms
and
and
raised
bumps
containing
rfids
but
sammy
knew
that
you
could
buy
standard
stock
like
it
from
a
catalog
that
mighty
generous
of
you
he
said
shaking
tjan
dry
firm
hand
our
pleasure
the
other
guy
said
better
get
in
line
though
or
you
gon
na
be
waiting
a
long
long
time
he
had
a
satisfied
expression
sammy
saw
that
what
he
mistaken
for
a
crowd
of
people
was
in
fact
a
long
jostling
queue
stretching
all
the
way
around
the
escalator
mezzanine
and
off
one
of
the
mall
side
corridors
feeling
like
he
averted
a
disaster
sammy
followed
the
length
of
the
queue
until
he
came
to
its
end
he
popped
in
a
headphone
and
set
up
his
headline
reader
to
his
day
news
he
fallen
behind
what
with
the
air
travel
and
all
most
of
the
stuff
in
his
cache
came
in
from
his
and
it
was
the
most
insipid
crap
anyway
but
he
had
to
listen
to
it
or
he
be
odd
man
out
at
the
watercooler
when
he
got
back
he
listened
with
half
an
ear
and
considered
the
gigantic
crowd
stretching
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
compared
with
the
of
fantasyland
it
was
nothing
goths
from
all
over
the
world
had
flocked
to
central
florida
for
that
germans
and
greeks
and
japanese
and
even
some
from
mumbai
and
russia
they
filled
the
park
to
capacity
thrilled
with
the
delightful
perversity
of
chirpy
old
disney
world
remade
as
a
goth
theme
park
but
a
line
this
long
in
boston
in
the
dead
of
winter
for
something
whose
sole
attraction
was
that
there
was
another
one
like
it
by
a
shitty
forgotten
outside
of
miami
christ
on
an
omnimover
the
line
moved
just
a
little
surge
and
there
was
a
cheer
all
down
the
mall
length
people
poured
past
him
headed
for
the
line
tail
vibrating
with
excitement
but
the
line
did
move
again
for
five
minutes
then
ten
then
another
surge
but
maybe
that
was
just
people
crowding
together
more
some
of
the
people
in
line
were
drinking
beers
out
of
paper
bags
and
getting
raucous
what
going
on
someone
hollered
from
behind
him
the
cry
was
taken
up
and
then
the
line
shuddered
and
moved
forward
some
then
nothing
thinking
sammy
got
out
of
line
and
walked
to
the
front
tjan
was
there
working
the
velvet
rope
letting
people
through
in
dribs
and
drabs
he
caught
sight
of
sammy
and
gave
him
a
solemn
nod
they
all
taking
too
long
to
ride
he
said
i
tell
them
fifteen
minutes
max
get
back
in
line
if
you
want
to
see
more
but
what
can
you
do
sammy
nodded
sympathetically
the
guy
with
the
funny
eyebrow
put
in
an
appearance
from
behind
the
heavy
black
curtains
send
through
two
more
he
said
and
grabbed
sammy
tugging
him
in
behind
the
curtain
it
was
dim
and
spotlit
almost
identical
to
florida
and
half
a
dozen
vehicles
waited
sammy
slid
into
one
and
let
the
spiel
wash
over
him
there
was
a
time
when
america
held
out
the
promise
of
a
new
way
of
living
and
working
the
new
work
boom
of
the
teens
was
a
period
of
unparalleled
invention
a
cambrian
explosion
of
creativity
not
seen
since
the
time
of
edison
and
unlike
edison
the
people
who
invented
the
new
work
revolution
were
artists
and
frauds
the
layout
was
slightly
different
due
to
the
support
pillars
but
as
similar
to
the
florida
version
as
geography
allowed
robots
humped
underfoot
moving
objects
keeping
them
in
sync
with
the
changes
in
florida
he
read
on
the
message
boards
that
florida
would
stay
open
late
so
that
the
riders
could
collaborate
with
the
attendees
at
the
boston
premiere
tweeting
back
and
forth
to
one
another
the
other
chairs
in
the
ride
crawled
around
each
exhibit
reversing
and
turning
slowly
riders
brought
their
chairs
up
alongside
one
another
and
conferred
in
low
voices
over
the
narration
from
the
scenery
he
thought
he
saw
a
couple
making
out
a
common
enough
occurrence
in
dark
rides
that
he
even
exploited
a
few
times
when
planning
out
rides
that
would
be
likely
to
attract
amorous
teenagers
they
had
a
key
demographic
too
young
to
leave
home
old
enough
to
pay
practically
anything
for
a
private
spot
to
score
some
nookie
the
air
smelled
of
printer
the
cheap
smell
of
where
vending
machines
outputted
cheap
kids
toys
here
it
cheap
though
here
it
smelled
futuristic
like
the
first
time
someone
had
handed
him
a
printed
prop
for
one
of
his
rides
it
had
been
a
head
for
an
updated
small
world
ride
then
it
had
smelled
like
something
foreign
and
new
and
exciting
and
frightening
like
the
first
days
of
a
different
world
smelling
that
again
remembering
the
crowds
outside
waiting
to
get
in
sammy
started
to
get
a
sick
feeling
the
kebab
rebounding
on
him
moving
as
if
in
a
dream
he
reached
down
into
his
lap
and
drew
out
a
small
utility
knife
there
would
be
infrared
cameras
but
he
knew
from
experience
that
they
could
see
through
ride
vehicles
slowly
he
fingered
the
access
panel
underside
until
he
found
a
loose
corner
he
snicked
out
the
knife
little
blade
he
brought
an
entire
suitcase
just
so
he
could
have
a
checked
bag
to
store
this
in
and
tugged
at
the
cables
inside
he
sawed
at
them
with
small
movements
feeling
the
copper
wires
inside
the
insulation
give
way
one
strand
at
a
time
the
chair
moved
jerkily
then
not
at
all
he
snipped
a
few
more
wires
just
to
be
sure
then
tucked
them
all
away
hey
he
called
my
chair
dead
he
had
fetched
up
in
a
central
pathway
where
the
chairs
tried
to
run
cloverleafs
around
four
displays
a
couple
chairs
swerved
around
him
he
thumped
the
panel
dramatically
then
stepped
out
and
shook
his
head
he
contrived
to
step
on
three
robots
on
the
way
to
another
chair
is
yours
working
he
asked
the
kid
riding
in
it
all
of
ten
years
old
and
of
indefinite
gender
yeah
the
kid
said
it
scooted
over
there
room
for
both
of
us
get
in
do
they
have
in
the
north
he
climbed
in
beside
the
kid
and
contrived
to
slide
one
sly
hand
under
the
panel
teasing
out
the
wires
the
second
time
was
easier
even
he
sliced
through
five
large
bundles
this
time
before
the
chair
ground
to
a
halt
its
gyros
whining
and
rocking
it
from
the
kid
looked
at
him
and
frowned
these
things
are
shit
it
said
with
real
vehemence
climbing
down
and
kicking
one
of
its
tires
and
then
kicking
a
couple
of
the
robots
for
good
measure
they
landed
another
great
breakdown
spot
directly
in
front
of
a
ranked
display
of
appliances
and
objects
he
remembered
seeing
that
one
in
its
nascent
stage
back
in
florida
just
a
couple
of
toy
guns
which
were
presently
joined
by
three
more
then
there
were
ten
then
fifty
then
a
high
wall
of
them
striking
and
charming
the
chair
breakdown
position
neatly
blocked
the
way
guess
we
better
walk
out
he
said
he
stepped
on
a
couple
more
robots
making
oops
noises
the
kid
enthusiastically
kicked
robots
out
of
its
way
chairs
swerved
around
them
as
other
riders
tried
to
navigate
they
were
approaching
the
exit
when
sammy
spotted
a
for
the
robots
they
were
standard
issue
for
robotic
vacuum
cleaners
and
other
appliances
and
he
had
one
in
his
old
apartment
they
were
supposed
to
be
safe
as
anything
but
a
friend
toddler
had
crawled
over
to
his
and
shoved
a
stack
of
dimes
into
its
recessed
jack
and
one
of
them
had
shorted
it
out
in
a
smoking
fizzing
fireworks
display
you
go
on
ahead
i
going
to
tie
my
shoes
sammy
bent
down
beside
the
charge
plate
his
back
to
the
kid
and
the
imagined
cameras
that
were
capturing
his
every
move
and
slipped
the
stack
of
coins
he
taken
from
his
pocket
into
the
little
slot
where
the
robots
inserted
their
charging
stamen
the
ensuing
shower
of
sparks
was
more
dramatic
than
he
remembered
maybe
it
was
the
darkened
room
the
kid
shrieked
and
ran
for
the
exit
sign
and
he
took
off
too
at
a
good
clip
they
get
the
ride
up
and
running
soon
enough
but
maybe
not
tonight
not
if
they
could
get
the
two
chairs
he
toasted
out
of
the
room
there
was
the
beginnings
of
chaos
at
the
exit
there
was
that
tjan
character
giving
him
an
intense
look
he
tried
to
head
for
the
down
escalator
but
tjan
cut
him
off
what
going
on
in
there
damnedest
thing
he
said
trying
to
keep
his
face
composed
my
chair
died
then
another
one
a
little
kid
was
riding
in
it
then
there
was
a
lot
of
electrical
sparks
and
i
walked
out
crazy
tjan
cocked
his
head
i
hope
you
not
hurt
we
could
have
a
doctor
look
at
you
there
are
a
couple
around
tonight
it
had
never
occurred
to
sammy
that
professional
types
might
turn
out
for
a
ride
like
this
but
of
course
it
was
obvious
there
were
probably
cops
local
politicians
lawyers
and
the
like
i
fine
he
said
do
worry
about
me
maybe
you
should
send
someone
in
for
the
people
still
in
there
though
that
being
taken
care
of
i
just
sorry
you
came
all
the
way
from
florida
for
this
kind
of
disappointment
that
just
brutal
measuring
stare
was
even
more
intense
uh
it
ok
i
had
meetings
here
this
week
this
was
just
a
cool
bonus
who
do
you
work
for
mickey
shit
insurance
company
he
said
that
be
norwich
union
then
right
they
got
a
headquarters
here
sammy
knew
how
this
went
norwich
union
did
have
headquarters
here
or
they
did
he
have
to
outguess
tjan
with
his
answer
are
you
going
to
stay
open
tonight
tjan
nodded
though
it
was
clear
whether
he
was
nodding
because
he
was
answering
in
the
affirmative
or
because
his
suspicions
had
been
confirmed
well
then
i
should
be
going
tjan
put
out
a
hand
oh
please
stay
i
sure
we
be
running
soon
you
should
get
a
whole
ride
through
no
really
i
have
to
go
he
shook
off
the
hand
and
pelted
down
the
escalator
and
out
into
the
freezing
night
his
blood
sang
in
his
ears
they
probably
would
get
the
ride
running
that
night
at
all
they
probably
would
send
that
whole
carnival
crowd
home
disappointed
he
won
some
kind
of
little
victory
over
something
he
felt
more
confident
of
his
victory
when
he
was
concerned
with
the
guy
with
the
funny
eyebrow
with
perry
he
seemed
little
more
than
a
bum
a
vag
but
this
tjan
reminded
him
of
the
climbers
he
met
through
his
career
at
walt
disney
world
keenly
observant
and
fast
formulators
of
strategies
someone
who
could
add
two
and
two
before
you
know
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
four
sammy
walked
back
to
his
hotel
as
quickly
as
he
could
given
the
icy
sidewalks
underfoot
and
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
lobby
of
the
old
office
tower
his
face
hurt
forehead
cheeks
and
nose
he
booked
his
return
flight
for
a
day
later
thinking
he
do
more
reccies
of
the
new
site
before
writing
his
report
and
heading
home
but
there
was
no
way
he
was
facing
down
that
tjan
guy
again
what
had
prompted
him
to
sabotage
the
ride
it
was
something
primal
something
he
had
been
in
any
real
control
of
he
been
in
some
kind
of
but
he
packed
the
little
knife
in
his
suitcase
and
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
before
leaving
the
room
so
how
instinctive
could
it
possibly
have
been
he
had
a
vision
of
the
carnival
atmosphere
in
the
market
stalls
outside
and
knew
that
even
after
the
ride
had
broken
down
the
crowd
had
lingered
laughing
and
browsing
and
enjoying
a
night
respite
from
the
world
and
the
cold
city
the
whos
down
in
had
gone
on
singing
even
after
he
grinched
their
ride
that
was
it
the
ride
did
just
make
use
of
content
it
content
he
could
never
convince
his
bosses
in
orlando
to
let
him
build
anything
remotely
like
this
and
given
enough
time
it
would
surely
overtake
them
that
tjan
someone
like
him
would
be
involved
if
there
was
some
serious
money
opportunity
on
the
line
he
seen
the
future
that
night
and
he
had
no
place
in
it
it
only
took
a
week
on
the
boston
ride
before
they
had
their
third
and
fourth
nodes
the
third
was
outside
of
san
francisco
in
a
gigantic
that
was
already
being
used
as
a
they
had
two
former
one
of
which
was
being
squatted
by
artists
who
needed
studio
space
the
other
one
made
a
perfect
location
for
a
new
ride
and
the
geeks
who
planned
on
building
it
had
cut
their
teeth
building
elaborate
burning
man
confectioneries
together
so
perry
gave
them
his
blessing
the
fourth
was
to
open
in
raleigh
in
the
research
triangle
where
the
strip
malls
ran
one
into
the
next
the
bitingly
ironic
southerners
who
proposed
it
were
the
daughters
of
old
ibm
stalwarts
who
been
running
a
women
tech
collective
since
they
realized
they
could
afford
college
and
dropped
out
together
they
wanted
to
see
how
much
admission
they
could
charge
if
they
let
it
be
known
that
they
would
plow
their
profits
into
scholarship
funds
for
local
women
perry
could
believe
that
these
people
wanted
to
open
their
own
rides
nor
that
they
thought
they
needed
his
permission
to
do
so
he
was
reminded
of
the
glory
days
of
new
work
when
every
day
there
were
fifty
new
work
sites
with
a
hundred
new
gizmos
popping
up
on
the
mailing
lists
looking
for
distributors
recruiting
competing
swarming
arguing
forming
and
reforming
watching
tjan
cut
the
deals
whereby
these
people
were
granted
permission
to
open
their
own
editions
of
the
ride
felt
like
that
and
weirder
still
why
do
they
need
our
permission
the
api
wide
open
they
can
just
implement
are
they
sheep
or
something
tjan
gave
him
an
look
they
being
polite
perry
they
giving
you
face
for
being
the
progenitor
of
the
ride
i
do
like
it
perry
said
i
did
get
anyone
permission
to
include
their
junk
in
the
ride
when
we
get
a
printer
to
clone
something
that
someone
brings
here
we
do
get
their
permission
why
the
hell
is
seeking
permission
considered
so
polite
shit
why
not
send
me
a
letter
asking
me
if
i
mind
receiving
an
email
where
does
it
end
they
trying
to
be
nice
to
you
perry
that
all
well
i
do
like
it
perry
said
how
about
this
from
now
on
when
someone
asks
for
permission
we
tell
them
no
we
do
give
out
withhold
permission
for
joining
the
network
but
we
hope
that
join
it
anyway
maybe
put
up
a
faq
on
the
site
you
just
confuse
people
i
wo
be
confusing
them
man
i
be
educating
them
how
about
if
you
add
a
creative
commons
license
to
it
some
of
them
are
very
liberal
i
do
to
license
this
you
have
to
something
to
license
it
a
license
is
a
way
of
saying
this
license
you
forbidden
to
do
this
you
do
need
a
license
to
click
a
link
and
load
a
webpage
no
one
has
to
give
you
permission
to
do
this
and
no
one
could
take
it
away
from
you
licensing
just
gives
people
even
worse
ideas
about
ownership
and
permission
and
property
it
your
show
tjan
said
no
it
that
the
ok
ok
it
not
your
show
but
we
do
it
your
way
you
are
a
lovable
cranky
weirdo
you
know
it
they
did
it
perry
way
he
was
scheduled
to
go
back
to
florida
a
few
days
later
but
he
changed
his
ticket
to
go
out
to
san
francisco
and
meet
with
the
crew
who
were
implementing
the
ride
there
one
of
them
taught
interaction
design
at
sfsu
and
brought
him
in
to
talk
to
the
students
he
was
sure
what
he
was
going
to
talk
to
them
about
but
when
he
got
there
he
found
himself
telling
the
story
of
how
he
and
lester
and
tjan
and
suzanne
and
kettlebelly
had
built
and
lost
the
new
work
movement
without
even
trying
it
was
a
fun
story
to
tell
from
start
to
finish
and
they
talked
through
the
lunch
break
and
then
a
group
of
students
took
him
to
a
bar
in
the
mission
with
a
big
outdoor
patio
where
he
went
on
telling
war
stories
until
the
sun
had
set
and
he
drunk
so
much
beer
he
could
tell
stories
any
longer
they
were
all
ten
or
fifteen
years
younger
than
him
and
the
girls
were
pretty
and
androgynous
and
the
boys
were
also
pretty
and
androgynous
not
that
he
really
swung
that
way
still
it
was
fine
being
surrounded
by
the
catcalling
joking
bullshitting
crowd
of
young
pretty
flirty
people
they
hugged
him
a
lot
and
two
of
the
prettier
girls
who
he
later
realized
were
a
lot
more
interested
in
each
other
than
him
took
him
back
to
a
capsule
hotel
built
across
three
and
poured
him
into
bed
and
tucked
him
in
he
had
a
burrito
the
size
of
a
football
for
breakfast
stuffed
with
shredded
and
two
kinds
of
sloppy
beans
he
washed
it
down
with
a
quart
of
a
drink
called
horchata
that
was
served
and
did
wonders
for
his
hangover
a
couple
hours
noodling
on
his
laptop
and
a
couple
bags
of
tecate
later
and
he
was
feeling
almost
human
early
mariachis
strolled
the
street
with
electric
guitars
that
controlled
little
tribes
of
dancing
singing
animatronics
belting
out
old
jose
alfredo
jimenez
tunes
it
was
shaping
up
to
be
a
good
day
his
laptop
rang
and
he
screwed
in
his
headset
and
started
talking
to
tjan
man
this
place
is
excellent
he
said
i
had
the
best
night
had
in
years
last
night
well
then
you
love
this
there
a
crew
in
madison
that
want
to
do
the
same
thing
and
could
use
a
little
guidance
they
spoke
to
me
this
morning
and
said
they
be
happy
to
spring
for
the
airfare
can
you
make
a
six
flight
at
sfo
they
gave
him
cheese
in
madison
and
introduced
him
to
the
biohackers
who
were
the
spiritual
progeny
of
the
quirky
moment
when
madison
was
one
of
six
places
where
stem
cells
could
be
legally
researched
the
biohackers
gave
him
the
willies
one
had
gills
one
glowed
in
the
dark
one
was
orange
and
claimed
to
photosynthesize
he
got
his
hosts
to
bring
him
to
the
ratskeller
where
they
sat
down
to
beers
and
huge
suspicious
steaming
wursts
where
your
site
we
were
thinking
of
building
one
there
a
lot
of
farmland
around
here
either
the
speaker
was
sixteen
years
old
or
perry
was
getting
to
be
such
a
drunken
old
fart
that
everyone
seemed
sixteen
he
old
enough
to
shave
anyway
perry
tried
to
remember
his
name
and
could
or
sleepdep
or
whatever
that
pretty
weird
everywhere
else
they
just
moving
into
spaces
that
have
been
left
vacant
we
have
got
many
of
those
all
the
offices
and
stuff
are
being
occupied
by
heavily
funded
startups
heavily
funded
startups
in
this
day
and
age
superbabies
the
kid
said
with
a
shrug
it
all
anyone
here
thinks
about
anymore
that
and
cancer
cures
i
think
superbabies
are
crazy
imagine
being
a
superbaby
with
technology
in
your
genes
in
your
germline
breeding
other
obsolete
superbabies
crazy
but
the
chinese
are
investing
heavily
so
no
dead
malls
christ
that
like
running
out
of
sand
or
hydrogen
or
something
are
we
still
in
america
the
kid
laughed
the
campus
is
building
more
student
housing
because
none
of
us
can
afford
the
rents
around
here
anymore
but
there
lots
of
farmland
like
i
said
wo
be
a
problem
to
throw
up
a
prefab
and
put
the
ride
inside
it
it
be
like
putting
up
a
haunted
cornfield
at
halloween
used
to
do
that
every
year
to
raise
money
for
the
aclu
back
in
nebraska
wow
he
wanted
to
say
have
the
aclu
in
nebraska
but
he
knew
that
was
fair
the
midwesterners
he
met
had
generally
been
geeks
and
hackers
so
he
had
no
call
to
turn
his
nose
up
at
this
kid
so
why
do
you
want
to
do
this
the
kid
grinned
because
there
got
to
be
a
way
to
do
something
cool
without
moving
to
new
york
i
like
it
around
here
do
want
to
live
in
some
defaulted
condo
where
the
mice
are
hunchbacked
like
the
spaces
but
i
do
want
to
be
a
farmer
or
an
academic
or
run
a
student
bar
all
that
stuff
is
a
i
can
see
it
from
here
i
mean
who
drinks
beer
anymore
there
much
sweeter
highs
out
there
in
the
real
world
perry
looked
at
his
beer
it
was
in
a
themed
stein
with
gingerbread
worked
into
the
finish
it
felt
like
it
had
been
printed
from
some
kind
of
hybrid
you
could
get
them
at
traveling
carny
midways
too
i
like
beer
he
said
but
you
the
kid
broke
off
old
perry
said
you
what
the
kid
said
i
a
late
bloomer
devoting
resources
to
more
important
things
than
puberty
two
more
kids
slid
into
their
booth
a
boy
and
a
girl
who
actually
did
look
hey
luke
the
girl
said
kissing
him
on
the
cheek
luke
that
was
his
name
perry
came
up
with
a
mnemonic
so
he
forget
it
again
nebraska
farm
boy
that
was
like
luke
skywalker
he
pictured
the
kid
swinging
a
lightsaber
and
knew
keep
the
name
for
good
now
this
is
perry
gibbons
luke
said
perry
this
is
hilda
and
ernie
guys
perry
the
guy
who
built
the
ride
i
was
telling
you
about
ernie
shook
his
hand
man
that
the
coolest
shit
i
ever
seen
wow
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here
i
love
that
stuff
wow
hilda
flicked
his
ear
stop
drooling
fanboy
she
said
ernie
rubbed
his
ear
perry
nodded
uncertainly
sorry
it
just
well
i
a
big
fan
is
all
that
really
nice
of
you
perry
said
he
met
a
couple
people
in
boston
and
san
francisco
who
called
themselves
his
fans
and
he
known
what
to
say
to
them
either
back
in
the
new
work
days
he
meet
reporters
who
called
themselves
fans
but
that
was
just
blowing
smoke
now
he
was
meeting
people
who
seemed
to
really
mean
it
not
many
thank
god
he
just
like
a
puppy
hilda
said
pinching
ernie
cheek
all
enthusiasm
ernie
rubbed
his
cheek
luke
reached
out
abruptly
and
tousled
both
of
their
hair
these
two
are
going
to
help
me
build
the
ride
he
said
hilda
an
amazing
fundraiser
last
year
she
ran
the
fundraising
for
a
whole
clinic
women
health
clinic
or
something
perry
asked
he
was
starting
to
sober
up
a
little
hilda
was
one
of
those
incredible
pneumatic
midwestern
girls
that
he
seen
at
five
minute
intervals
since
getting
off
his
flight
in
madison
he
did
think
he
ever
met
one
like
her
no
hilda
said
metabolic
health
lots
of
people
get
the
fatkins
treatment
at
puberty
either
because
their
fatkins
parents
talk
them
into
it
or
because
they
hate
their
baby
fat
perry
shook
his
head
come
again
you
think
eating
ten
thousand
calories
a
day
is
easy
it
hell
on
your
digestive
system
not
to
mention
you
spend
a
fortune
on
food
a
lot
of
people
get
to
college
and
just
switch
to
powdered
supplements
because
they
ca
afford
enough
real
food
to
stay
healthy
so
you
got
all
these
kids
sucking
down
vanilla
slurry
all
day
just
to
keep
from
starving
we
provide
counseling
and
mitigation
therapies
to
kids
who
want
it
and
when
they
get
out
of
college
do
they
get
the
treatment
again
you
ca
the
mitigation
permanent
people
who
take
it
have
to
go
through
the
rest
of
their
lives
taking
supplements
and
eating
sensibly
and
exercising
do
they
get
fat
she
looked
away
then
down
then
back
up
at
him
yes
most
of
them
do
how
could
they
not
everything
around
them
is
geared
at
people
who
need
to
eat
five
times
as
much
as
they
do
even
the
salads
all
have
protein
powder
mixed
in
with
them
but
it
is
to
eat
right
you
never
had
the
treatment
have
you
perry
shook
his
head
trick
metabolism
though
i
can
eat
like
a
hog
and
not
put
on
an
ounce
hilda
reached
out
and
squeezed
his
bicep
really
and
i
suppose
that
all
that
lean
muscle
there
is
part
of
your
trick
metabolism
too
she
left
her
hand
where
it
was
ok
i
do
a
fair
bit
of
physical
labor
too
but
i
just
saying
if
they
get
fat
again
after
they
reverse
the
treatment
there
are
worse
things
than
being
fat
her
hand
still
had
moved
he
looked
at
ernie
whom
he
assumed
was
her
boyfriend
to
see
how
he
was
taking
it
ernie
was
looking
somewhere
else
though
across
the
ratshkeller
at
the
huge
tv
that
was
showing
competitive
multiplayer
gaming
apparently
some
kind
of
championships
it
was
as
confusing
as
a
hundred
games
being
played
on
the
same
board
with
thousands
of
zipping
jumping
firing
entities
and
so
fast
that
perry
could
imagine
how
make
sense
of
it
the
girl
hand
was
still
on
his
arm
and
it
was
warm
his
mouth
was
dry
but
more
beer
would
be
a
bad
idea
how
about
some
water
he
said
in
a
bit
of
a
croak
luke
jumped
up
to
get
some
and
a
silence
fell
over
the
table
so
this
clinic
how
you
fundraise
for
it
papercraft
she
said
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
who
are
into
and
we
modded
a
bunch
of
patterns
we
did
really
big
pieces
too
sofas
chairs
like
actual
furniture
like
actual
furniture
she
said
with
a
solemn
nod
we
used
huge
sheets
of
paper
and
treated
them
with
stiffening
waterproofing
and
fireproofing
agents
we
did
a
frat
house
outdoor
bar
and
sauna
with
a
i
even
made
a
steam
engine
you
made
a
steam
engine
out
of
paper
he
was
agog
you
mean
to
say
that
surprised
by
building
stuff
out
of
unusual
materials
perry
laughed
point
taken
we
just
got
a
couple
hundred
students
to
do
some
folding
in
their
spare
time
and
then
sold
it
on
everyone
on
campus
needs
bookshelves
so
we
started
with
those
using
arched
supports
under
each
shelf
we
could
paint
or
print
designs
on
them
too
but
a
lot
of
people
liked
them
then
we
did
chairs
desks
kitchenette
sets
placemats
you
name
it
i
called
the
designs
origami
perry
sprayed
beer
out
his
nose
that
awesome
he
said
wiping
up
the
mess
with
a
kleenex
that
she
extracted
from
a
folded
paper
purse
looking
closely
he
realized
that
the
white
baseball
cap
she
was
wearing
was
also
folded
out
of
paper
she
laughed
and
rummaged
some
more
in
her
handbag
coming
up
with
a
piece
of
stiff
card
working
quickly
and
nimbly
she
gave
it
a
few
deft
folds
along
lines
and
a
moment
later
she
was
holding
a
baseball
hat
that
was
the
twin
of
the
one
she
was
wearing
she
leaned
over
the
table
and
popped
it
on
his
head
luke
came
back
with
the
water
and
set
it
down
between
them
pouring
out
glasses
for
everyone
smooth
lid
he
said
touching
the
bill
of
perry
cap
thanks
perry
said
draining
his
water
and
pouring
another
glass
well
you
people
certainly
have
some
pretty
cool
stuff
going
on
here
this
is
a
great
town
luke
said
expansively
as
though
he
had
travelled
extensively
and
settled
on
madison
wisconsin
as
a
truly
international
hotspot
we
going
to
build
a
ride
you
going
to
make
it
all
out
of
paper
some
of
it
anyway
luke
said
hilda
would
have
it
any
other
way
right
this
one
your
show
luke
she
said
i
just
a
fundraiser
anyone
hungry
hilda
said
i
want
to
go
eat
something
that
have
unidentified
mixed
in
go
on
without
me
ernie
said
i
got
money
on
this
game
homework
luke
said
perry
had
just
eaten
and
had
planned
on
spending
this
night
in
his
room
catching
up
on
email
yeah
i
starving
he
said
he
felt
like
a
kid
but
in
a
good
way
they
went
out
for
ukrainian
food
which
perry
had
never
had
before
but
the
crepes
and
the
blood
sausage
were
tasty
enough
mostly
though
he
was
paying
attention
to
hilda
who
was
running
down
her
war
stories
from
the
multiple
origami
fundraiser
there
were
funny
ones
sad
ones
scary
ones
triumphant
ones
every
one
of
her
stories
reminded
him
of
one
of
his
own
she
was
an
organizer
and
so
was
he
and
they
been
through
practically
the
same
shit
they
drank
gallons
of
coffee
afterward
getting
chucked
out
when
the
restaurant
closed
and
migrating
to
a
cafe
on
the
main
drag
where
they
had
low
tables
and
sofas
and
they
never
stopped
talking
you
know
hilda
said
stretching
and
yawning
it
coming
up
on
four
am
no
way
he
said
but
his
watch
confirmed
it
christ
he
tried
to
think
of
a
casual
way
of
asking
her
to
sleep
with
him
for
all
their
talking
they
hardly
touched
on
romance
or
maybe
there
been
romance
in
every
word
i
walk
you
to
your
hotel
she
said
hey
that
really
nice
of
you
he
said
his
voice
sounded
fakey
and
forced
in
his
ears
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
tired
at
all
instead
his
heart
was
hammering
in
his
chest
and
his
blood
sang
in
his
ears
there
was
hardly
any
talk
on
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
just
the
awareness
of
her
steps
and
his
in
time
with
one
another
over
the
cold
streets
no
traffic
at
that
hour
and
hardly
a
sound
from
any
of
the
windows
they
passed
the
town
was
theirs
at
the
door
to
his
hotel
another
stack
of
the
ubiquitous
capsules
these
geared
to
visiting
parents
they
stopped
they
were
looking
at
one
another
like
a
couple
of
kids
at
the
end
of
a
date
in
a
sitcom
um
what
your
major
he
said
pure
math
she
said
i
think
i
know
what
that
is
he
said
it
was
freezing
out
on
the
street
theory
right
pure
math
as
opposed
to
applied
math
she
said
do
you
really
care
about
this
um
he
said
well
yes
but
not
very
much
i
come
into
your
hotel
room
but
we
not
having
sex
ok
ok
he
said
there
was
room
enough
for
the
two
of
them
in
the
capsule
but
only
just
these
were
prefabbed
in
bulk
and
they
came
in
different
sizes
in
the
midwest
they
were
large
the
ones
stacked
up
in
san
francisco
parking
spots
were
small
still
he
and
hilda
were
almost
in
each
other
laps
and
he
could
smell
her
feel
wisps
of
her
hair
tickling
his
ear
you
really
nice
he
said
late
at
night
his
ability
to
be
flippant
evaporated
he
was
left
with
simple
truths
simply
declared
i
like
you
a
lot
well
then
you
have
to
come
back
to
madison
and
check
in
on
the
ride
wo
you
um
he
said
he
had
a
planning
meeting
with
luke
and
the
rest
of
his
gang
the
next
day
then
he
was
supposed
to
be
headed
for
omaha
where
tjan
had
set
up
another
crew
for
him
to
speak
to
at
this
rate
he
would
get
back
to
florida
some
time
in
june
perry
you
not
a
career
activist
are
you
nope
he
said
i
had
really
imagined
that
there
was
such
a
thing
my
parents
both
of
them
here
what
being
a
career
activist
means
you
are
on
the
road
most
of
the
time
when
you
get
on
the
road
you
meet
people
have
intense
experiences
with
them
like
going
to
war
or
touring
with
a
band
you
fall
in
love
a
thousand
times
and
then
you
leave
all
those
people
behind
you
get
off
a
plane
turn
some
strangers
into
best
friends
get
on
a
plane
and
forget
them
until
you
come
back
into
town
and
then
you
take
it
all
back
up
again
if
you
want
to
survive
this
you
got
to
love
that
you
got
to
get
off
a
plane
meet
people
fall
in
love
with
them
treasure
every
moment
and
know
that
moments
are
all
you
have
then
you
get
on
a
plane
again
and
you
love
them
forever
otherwise
every
new
meeting
is
sour
because
you
know
how
soon
it
will
end
it
like
starting
to
say
your
goodbyes
before
you
even
unpacked
your
you
got
to
embrace
or
at
least
forget
that
every
gig
will
end
in
a
day
or
two
perry
took
a
moment
to
understand
this
swallowed
a
couple
times
then
nodded
lots
of
people
had
come
in
and
out
of
his
factory
and
his
ride
over
the
years
lester
came
and
went
suzanne
was
gone
tjan
was
gone
but
was
back
again
kettlebelly
was
no
longer
in
his
life
at
all
a
ghost
of
a
memory
with
a
great
smile
and
good
cologne
already
he
was
forgetting
the
faces
in
boston
the
faces
in
san
francisco
hilda
would
be
a
memory
in
a
month
hilda
patted
his
hand
i
have
friends
in
practically
every
city
in
america
my
folks
campaigned
for
stem
cells
up
and
down
every
red
state
in
the
country
i
even
met
superman
before
he
died
he
knew
my
name
i
spent
ten
years
on
the
road
with
them
back
and
forth
the
bush
years
a
couple
years
afterward
you
can
live
this
way
and
you
can
be
happy
but
you
got
to
have
right
mind
what
it
means
is
you
got
to
be
able
to
say
things
to
people
you
meet
like
really
nice
and
mean
it
really
mean
it
but
you
also
got
to
be
cool
with
the
fact
that
really
nice
people
will
fall
out
of
your
life
every
week
twice
a
week
and
fall
back
into
it
or
not
i
think
you
very
nice
too
but
we
not
gon
na
be
a
couple
ever
even
if
we
slept
together
tonight
you
be
gone
tomorrow
night
what
you
need
to
ask
yourself
is
whether
you
want
to
have
friends
in
every
city
who
are
glad
to
see
you
when
you
get
off
the
plane
or
in
every
city
who
might
show
up
with
their
new
boyfriends
or
not
at
all
are
you
telling
me
this
to
explain
why
we
not
going
to
sleep
together
i
just
figured
you
were
dating
that
guy
ernie
ernie
my
brother
she
said
and
yeah
that
kind
of
why
telling
you
this
i
never
gone
on
what
you
might
call
a
date
with
my
friends
it
tends
to
be
more
like
you
work
together
you
hang
out
together
you
catch
yourself
looking
into
one
another
eyes
a
couple
times
then
you
do
a
little
circling
around
and
then
you
end
up
in
your
bed
or
their
bed
having
hard
energetic
sex
and
then
you
sort
out
some
details
and
then
it
lasts
as
long
as
it
lasts
we
done
a
compressed
version
of
that
tonight
and
we
up
to
the
sex
and
so
i
thought
we
should
lay
some
things
on
the
table
you
should
forgive
the
expression
perry
thought
back
to
his
with
lester
the
girl
had
been
pretty
and
intelligent
and
would
have
taken
him
home
if
he
made
the
least
effort
he
had
though
this
girl
was
inappropriate
in
so
many
ways
young
rooted
to
a
city
thousands
of
miles
from
home
why
had
he
brought
her
back
to
the
hotel
a
thought
struck
him
why
do
you
think
i
going
to
be
getting
on
and
off
planes
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
got
a
home
to
get
to
you
have
been
reading
the
message
boards
have
you
which
message
boards
for
there
are
projects
starting
up
everywhere
people
like
what
they
heard
and
what
they
seen
and
they
remember
you
from
the
old
days
and
want
to
get
in
on
the
magic
you
going
to
bring
a
lot
of
us
know
each
other
anyway
from
other
joint
projects
everyone
passing
the
hat
to
raise
your
airfare
and
arguing
about
who
sofa
you
going
to
stay
on
he
known
that
they
were
there
there
were
always
but
they
were
just
talk
he
never
bothered
to
read
them
that
was
lester
job
he
wanted
to
make
stuff
not
chatter
jesus
when
the
hell
was
someone
going
to
tell
me
your
guy
in
boston
we
been
talking
to
him
he
said
not
to
bug
you
that
you
were
busy
enough
as
it
is
he
did
did
he
in
the
old
days
tjan
had
been
in
charge
of
planning
and
he
been
in
charge
of
the
ideas
in
charge
of
what
to
plan
had
they
come
full
circle
without
him
noticing
if
they
had
was
that
so
bad
man
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
spending
a
couple
nights
in
my
own
bed
is
it
much
more
comfortable
than
this
one
she
thumped
the
narrow
which
was
surprisingly
comfortable
adjustable
heated
and
massaging
he
snorted
ok
i
sleep
on
a
futon
on
the
floor
back
home
but
the
principle
of
the
thing
i
just
miss
home
i
guess
so
go
home
for
a
couple
days
after
this
stop
or
the
next
one
charge
up
your
batteries
and
do
your
laundry
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
home
is
going
to
be
your
suitcase
pretty
soon
perry
my
dear
her
voice
was
thick
with
sleep
her
eyes
and
bleary
you
probably
right
he
yawned
as
he
spoke
hell
i
know
right
you
a
real
smarty
and
i
too
tired
to
go
home
she
said
so
i
a
smarty
staying
with
you
he
was
suddenly
wide
awake
his
heart
thumping
um
ok
he
said
trying
to
sound
casual
he
turned
back
the
sheets
then
standing
facing
into
the
cramped
corner
took
off
his
jeans
and
shoes
and
socks
climbing
in
between
the
sheets
in
his
underwear
and
tee
there
were
undressing
noises
exquisite
ones
and
then
she
slithered
in
behind
him
snuggled
up
against
him
with
a
jolt
he
realized
that
her
bare
breasts
were
pressed
to
his
back
her
arm
came
around
him
and
rested
on
his
stomach
which
jumped
like
a
spring
uncoiling
he
felt
certain
his
erection
was
emitting
a
faint
glow
her
breath
was
on
his
neck
he
thought
about
casually
rolling
onto
his
back
so
that
he
could
kiss
her
but
remembered
her
admonition
that
they
would
not
be
having
sex
her
fingertips
traced
small
circles
on
his
stomach
each
time
they
grazed
his
navel
his
stomach
did
a
flip
he
was
totally
awake
now
and
when
her
lips
very
softly
so
softly
he
barely
felt
it
brushed
against
the
base
of
his
skull
he
let
out
a
soft
moan
her
lips
returned
and
then
her
teeth
worrying
at
the
tendons
at
the
back
of
his
neck
with
increasing
roughness
an
exquisite
that
was
electric
he
was
panting
her
hand
was
flat
on
his
stomach
now
gripping
him
his
erection
strained
toward
it
her
hips
ground
against
him
and
she
moved
her
mouth
toward
his
ear
nipping
at
it
the
tip
of
her
tongue
touching
the
whorls
there
her
hand
was
on
the
move
now
sliding
over
his
ribs
her
fingertips
at
his
nipple
softly
and
then
harder
giving
it
an
abrupt
hard
pinch
that
had
some
fingernail
in
it
like
a
bite
from
little
teeth
he
yelped
and
she
giggled
in
his
ear
sending
shivers
up
his
spine
he
reached
back
behind
him
awkwardly
and
put
his
hand
on
her
ass
discovering
that
she
was
bare
there
too
it
was
wide
and
hard
foam
rubber
over
steel
and
he
kneaded
it
digging
his
fingers
in
she
groaned
in
his
ear
and
tugged
him
onto
his
back
as
soon
as
his
shoulders
hit
the
narrow
bed
she
was
on
him
her
elbows
on
his
biceps
pinning
him
down
her
breasts
in
his
face
fragrant
and
soft
her
hot
bare
crotch
ground
against
his
underwear
he
bit
at
her
tits
hard
little
bites
that
made
her
gasp
he
found
a
stiff
nipple
and
sucked
it
into
his
mouth
beating
at
it
with
his
tongue
she
pressed
her
crotch
harder
against
his
hissed
something
that
might
have
been
she
straightened
up
so
that
she
was
straddling
him
and
looking
imperiously
down
on
him
her
braids
swung
before
her
her
eyes
were
exultant
her
face
was
set
in
an
expression
of
fierce
concentration
as
she
rocked
on
him
he
dug
his
fingers
into
her
ass
again
all
the
way
around
so
that
they
brushed
against
her
labia
her
asshole
he
pulled
at
her
dragging
her
up
her
body
tugging
her
vagina
toward
his
mouth
once
she
saw
what
he
was
after
she
up
the
bed
in
three
or
four
quick
steps
and
then
she
was
on
his
face
her
smell
and
her
taste
and
her
texture
and
temperature
filled
his
senses
blotting
out
the
room
blotting
out
introspection
blotting
out
everything
except
for
the
sweet
urgency
he
sucked
at
her
labia
before
slipping
his
tongue
up
her
length
letting
it
tickle
her
ass
her
opening
her
clit
in
response
she
ground
against
him
planting
her
opening
over
his
mouth
and
he
her
in
hard
fast
strokes
she
reached
back
and
took
hold
of
his
cock
slipping
her
small
strong
hand
under
the
waistband
of
his
boxers
and
curling
it
around
his
rigid
shaft
pumping
vigorously
he
moaned
into
her
pussy
and
that
set
her
shuddering
now
he
had
her
clit
sucked
into
his
mouth
and
he
was
lapping
at
its
engorged
length
with
short
strokes
her
thighs
were
clamped
over
his
ears
but
he
could
still
make
out
her
cries
timed
with
the
shuddering
of
her
thighs
the
spasmodic
grip
on
his
cock
abruptly
she
rolled
off
of
him
and
the
world
came
back
they
kissed
yet
they
had
said
a
word
she
lay
beside
him
half
on
top
of
him
shuddering
and
making
kittenish
sounds
he
kissed
her
softly
then
more
forcefully
she
bit
at
his
lips
and
his
tongue
sucking
it
into
her
mouth
and
chewing
at
it
while
her
fingernails
raked
his
back
her
breathing
became
more
regular
and
she
tugged
at
the
waistband
of
his
boxers
he
got
the
message
and
yanked
them
off
his
cock
springing
free
and
rocking
slightly
twitching
in
time
with
his
pulse
she
smiled
a
grin
and
went
to
work
kissing
his
neck
his
chest
hard
bites
on
his
nipples
that
made
him
yelp
and
arch
his
back
his
stomach
his
hips
his
pubes
his
thighs
the
teasing
was
excruciating
and
exquisite
her
juices
dried
on
his
face
the
smell
caught
in
his
nose
refreshing
his
eros
with
every
breath
her
tongue
lapped
eagerly
at
his
balls
like
a
cat
with
a
saucer
of
milk
long
slow
strokes
over
his
sack
over
the
skin
between
his
balls
and
his
thighs
over
his
perineum
tickling
his
ass
as
tickled
hers
she
pulled
back
and
spat
out
a
pube
and
laughed
and
dove
back
in
sucking
softly
at
his
sack
then
in
one
swift
motion
taking
his
cock
to
the
hilt
he
shouted
and
then
moaned
and
her
head
bobbed
furiously
along
the
length
of
his
shaft
her
hand
squeezing
his
balls
it
took
only
moments
before
he
dug
his
hands
hard
into
the
mattress
and
groaned
through
clenched
teeth
and
fired
spasm
after
spasm
down
her
throat
her
nose
in
his
pubes
his
cock
down
her
throat
to
the
base
she
refused
to
let
him
go
swirling
her
tongue
over
the
head
while
he
was
still
making
him
grunt
and
twitch
and
buck
involuntarily
all
the
while
her
hand
caressing
his
balls
rubbing
at
his
prostate
over
the
spot
between
his
balls
and
his
ass
finally
she
worked
her
way
back
up
his
body
licking
her
lips
and
kissing
as
she
went
hello
she
said
as
she
buried
her
face
in
his
throat
wow
he
said
so
if
you
going
to
be
able
to
live
in
the
moment
and
have
no
regrets
this
is
a
pretty
good
place
to
start
it
be
a
hell
of
a
shock
if
we
saw
each
other
twice
in
the
next
year
are
we
going
to
be
able
to
be
friends
when
we
do
will
the
fact
that
i
fucked
your
brains
out
make
things
awkward
that
why
you
jumped
me
no
not
really
i
was
horny
and
you
hot
but
that
a
good
reason
i
see
you
know
you
have
actually
fucked
my
brains
out
he
said
yet
she
said
she
retrieved
her
backpack
from
beside
the
bed
dug
around
it
in
and
produced
a
strip
of
condoms
yet
he
licked
his
lips
in
anticipation
and
a
moment
later
she
was
unrolling
the
condom
down
his
shaft
with
her
talented
mouth
he
laughed
and
then
took
her
by
the
waist
and
flipped
her
onto
her
back
she
grabbed
her
ankles
and
pulled
her
legs
wide
and
he
dove
between
her
dragging
the
tip
of
his
cock
up
and
down
the
length
of
her
vulva
a
couple
times
before
sawing
it
in
and
out
of
her
opening
sinking
to
the
hilt
he
wanted
to
fuck
her
gently
but
she
groaned
urgent
demands
in
his
ear
to
pound
her
harder
making
satisfied
sounds
each
time
his
balls
clapped
against
her
ass
she
pushed
him
off
her
and
turned
over
raising
her
ass
in
the
air
pulling
her
labia
apart
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
him
they
fucked
then
until
his
legs
trembled
and
his
knees
ached
and
then
she
climbed
on
him
and
rocked
back
and
forth
grinding
her
clit
against
his
pubis
pushing
him
so
deep
inside
her
he
mauled
her
tits
and
felt
the
pressure
build
in
his
balls
he
pulled
her
to
him
thrust
wildly
and
she
hissed
dirty
encouragement
in
his
ear
begging
him
to
fill
her
ordering
him
to
pound
her
harder
the
stimulation
in
his
brain
and
between
his
legs
was
too
much
to
bear
and
he
came
lifting
them
both
off
the
bed
with
his
spasms
wow
he
said
yum
she
said
jesus
it
he
said
i
got
to
meet
with
luke
in
three
hours
so
let
take
a
shower
now
and
set
an
alarm
for
half
an
hour
before
he
due
she
said
got
anything
to
eat
that
what
i
like
about
you
hilda
he
said
businesslike
vigorous
living
life
to
the
hilt
her
dimples
were
pretty
and
luminous
in
the
hints
of
light
emerging
from
under
the
blinds
feed
me
she
said
and
nipped
at
his
earlobe
in
the
fridge
he
had
a
brick
of
wisconsin
cheddar
that
he
been
given
when
he
stepped
off
the
plane
they
broke
chunks
off
it
and
ate
it
in
bed
then
started
in
on
the
bag
of
soy
crispies
his
hosts
in
san
francisco
had
given
him
they
showered
slowly
together
scrubbing
backs
set
an
alarm
and
sacked
out
for
just
a
few
hours
before
the
alarm
roused
them
they
dressed
like
strangers
not
embarrassed
just
too
groggy
to
take
much
notice
of
one
another
perry
muscles
ached
pleasantly
and
there
was
another
ache
dull
and
faint
even
more
pleasant
in
his
balls
once
they
were
fully
clothed
she
grabbed
him
and
gave
him
a
long
hug
and
a
warm
kiss
that
started
on
his
throat
and
moved
to
his
mouth
with
just
a
hint
of
tongue
at
the
end
you
a
good
man
perry
gibbons
she
said
thanks
for
a
lovely
night
remember
what
i
told
you
though
no
regrets
no
looking
back
be
happy
about
this
do
mope
do
miss
me
go
on
to
your
next
city
and
make
new
friends
and
have
new
conversations
and
when
we
see
each
other
again
be
my
friend
without
any
awkwardness
all
right
i
get
it
he
said
he
felt
slightly
irritated
only
one
thing
we
were
going
to
sleep
together
you
regret
it
of
course
not
he
said
but
it
going
to
make
this
injunction
of
yours
hard
to
understand
i
not
good
at
anonymous
one
night
stands
she
raised
one
eyebrow
at
him
earth
to
perry
this
was
anonymous
and
it
was
a
stand
it
was
an
intimate
loving
relationship
that
happened
to
be
compressed
into
a
single
day
loving
sure
if
i
been
with
you
for
a
month
or
two
i
would
have
fallen
in
love
you
just
my
type
so
i
think
of
you
as
someone
i
love
why
i
want
to
make
sure
you
understand
what
this
all
means
you
a
very
interesting
person
he
said
i
smart
she
said
and
cuddled
him
again
you
smart
so
be
smart
about
this
and
it
be
forever
sweet
she
left
him
off
at
the
spot
where
he
was
supposed
to
meet
luke
and
the
rest
of
his
planning
team
to
go
over
schematics
and
theory
and
practice
all
of
these
discussions
could
happen
online
they
did
in
fact
but
there
was
something
about
the
connection
the
meeting
ran
six
hours
before
he
was
finally
saved
by
his
impending
flight
to
nebraska
sleepdep
came
down
on
him
like
a
hammer
as
he
checked
in
for
his
flight
and
began
the
ritual
he
missed
a
cue
or
two
and
ended
up
getting
a
detailed
hand
search
but
even
that
did
wake
him
up
he
fell
asleep
in
the
waiting
room
and
in
the
plane
in
the
taxi
to
his
hotel
but
when
he
dropped
down
onto
his
hotel
bed
he
could
sleep
the
hotel
was
the
spitting
image
of
the
one
he
left
in
wisconsin
minus
hilda
and
the
musky
smell
the
two
of
them
had
left
behind
after
their
roll
in
the
hay
it
had
been
years
since
he
had
a
regular
girlfriend
and
he
never
missed
it
there
had
been
women
fatkins
girls
and
random
strangers
some
who
came
back
for
a
date
or
two
but
no
one
meant
anything
or
whom
he
wanted
to
mean
anything
the
closest
come
had
been
he
sat
up
with
a
start
and
realized
that
the
last
woman
he
had
any
strong
feelings
for
had
been
suzanne
church
kettlewell
emerged
from
new
work
rich
he
taken
home
large
bonuses
every
year
that
kodacell
had
experienced
growth
a
better
metric
than
turning
an
actual
ahem
profit
and
he
invested
in
a
diverse
portfolio
that
had
everything
from
soybeans
to
software
in
it
along
with
real
estate
oops
and
fine
art
he
believed
in
the
new
work
believed
in
it
with
every
fiber
of
his
being
but
an
undiverse
portfolio
was
irresponsible
the
new
work
crash
had
killed
the
net
worth
of
a
lot
of
irresponsible
people
living
in
the
caymans
got
boring
after
a
year
the
kids
hated
the
international
school
scuba
diving
amazed
him
by
going
from
endlessly
meditatively
fascinating
to
deadly
dull
in
less
than
a
year
he
want
to
sail
he
did
want
to
get
drunk
he
did
want
to
join
the
creepy
zillionaires
on
their
sex
tours
of
the
caribbean
and
have
even
if
his
wife
would
have
stood
for
it
a
year
after
the
new
work
crash
he
filed
a
with
the
irs
and
paid
them
forty
million
dollars
in
back
taxes
and
penalties
and
repatriated
his
wealth
to
an
american
bank
now
he
lived
in
a
renovated
housing
project
on
potrero
hill
in
san
francisco
all
upscale
now
with
restored
kitschy
and
vintage
linoleum
and
stucco
ceilings
he
had
four
units
over
two
floors
with
cleverly
walls
and
a
spiral
staircase
the
kids
freaking
loved
the
staircase
suzanne
church
called
him
from
sfo
to
let
him
know
that
she
was
on
her
way
in
having
cleared
security
and
customs
after
a
scant
hour
he
found
himself
unaccountably
nervous
about
her
now
and
realized
with
a
little
giggle
that
he
had
something
like
a
crush
on
her
nothing
serious
nothing
his
wife
needed
to
worry
about
but
she
was
smart
and
funny
and
attractive
and
incisive
and
fearless
and
it
was
a
hell
of
a
combination
the
kids
were
away
at
school
and
his
wife
was
having
a
couple
of
days
camping
with
the
girls
in
yosemite
which
facts
lent
a
little
charge
to
suzanne
impending
visit
he
looked
up
the
airbart
schedule
and
calculated
how
long
he
had
until
she
arrived
at
the
street
station
a
brisk
minute
walk
from
his
place
minutes
just
minutes
he
checked
the
and
then
did
a
quick
mirror
check
his
months
in
the
caymans
had
given
him
a
deep
tan
that
he
kept
up
despite
san
francisco
grey
skies
he
still
looked
like
a
surfer
albeit
with
just
a
little
he
gained
more
weight
through
his
wife
pregnancies
than
she
had
and
only
hard
cycling
over
and
around
potrero
hill
had
knocked
it
off
again
his
jeans
neat
rows
of
pockets
and
mobius
seams
were
a
little
outdated
but
they
looked
good
on
him
as
did
his
print
shirt
with
its
motif
finally
he
plopped
down
to
read
a
book
and
waited
for
suzanne
and
managed
to
get
through
a
whole
page
in
the
intervening
ten
minutes
kettlebelly
she
hollered
as
she
came
through
the
door
she
took
him
in
a
hug
that
smelled
of
stale
airplane
and
restless
sleep
and
gave
him
a
thorough
squeezing
she
held
him
at
arm
length
and
they
sized
each
other
up
she
been
a
when
he
seen
her
last
in
a
way
now
she
was
years
older
and
her
time
in
russia
had
given
her
a
forest
of
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
eyes
she
had
a
sad
wise
turn
to
her
face
that
he
never
seen
there
before
like
a
painted
pieta
her
hands
had
gone
a
little
wrinkly
her
knuckles
more
prominent
but
her
fingernails
were
beautifully
manicured
and
her
clothes
were
stylish
foreign
exotic
and
european
she
laughed
huskily
and
said
you
have
changed
a
bit
ouch
he
said
i
older
and
wiser
i
have
you
know
it
does
show
she
said
i
older
but
no
wiser
he
took
her
hand
and
looked
at
the
simple
platinum
band
on
her
finger
but
you
married
now
nothing
wises
you
up
faster
in
my
experience
she
looked
at
her
hand
oh
that
no
that
just
to
keep
the
wolves
at
bay
married
women
are
the
same
kinds
of
targets
that
single
ones
are
give
me
water
and
then
a
beer
please
glad
to
have
something
to
do
he
busied
himself
in
the
kitchen
while
she
prowled
the
place
i
remember
when
these
places
were
real
ghettos
what
did
you
mean
about
being
a
target
st
pete
you
know
lawless
state
everyone
on
the
make
i
had
a
bodyguard
most
of
the
time
but
if
i
wanted
to
go
to
a
restaurant
i
did
want
to
have
to
fend
off
the
mafiyeh
who
wanted
to
offer
me
the
deal
of
a
lifetime
on
a
marriage
jeez

what
the
big
panic

shopping
malls
and
steal
their
babies
to

lord

the
anyone

the
age
of
fifty
who
knows
how
to
drive
got
there
by
being
an
apparat
in
the
soviet
days
which
means
that
they
learned
to
drive
when
the
roads
were
empty
they
do
signal
they
straddle
lanes
they
ca

mean

ca

a
frat
party
the
next
day
with
a
lot
of
innocent
bystanders
hookers
muggers
and
pickpockets
landon
looked
at
her
she
was
animated
and
vivid
thin
age
had
brought
out
her
cheekbones
and
her
eyes
had
she
had
a
it
was
common
enough
all
the
medical
tourists
loved
russia
maybe
she
was
just
she
made
a
show
of
sniffing
herself
phew
i
need
a
shower
can
i
borrow
your
facilities
sure
he
said
i
put
clean
towels
out
in
the
kids
bathroom
upstairs
and
second
on
the
right
she
came
down
with
her
fine
hair
slicked
back
over
her
ears
her
face
scrubbed
and
shining
i
a
new
woman
she
said
let
go
somewhere
and
eat
something
ok
he
took
her
for
pupusas
at
a
salvadoran
place
on
goat
hill
they
slogged
up
and
down
the
hills
and
valleys
taking
the
steps
cut
into
the
steep
sides
walking
past
the
painted
ladies
grand
gaudy
victorian
and
the
wobbly
heavy
canvas
that
had
sprung
up
where
the
big
quake
and
landslides
had
washed
away
parts
of
the
hills
i
forgotten
that
they
had
hills
like
that
she
said
greedily
guzzling
an
horchata
her
face
was
streaked
with
sweat
and
flushed
it
made
her
look
prettier
younger
my
son
and
i
walk
them
every
day
you
drag
a
little
kid
up
and
down
that
every
christ
child
abuse
well
he
poops
out
after
a
couple
of
peaks
and
i
end
up
carrying
him
you
him
you
must
be
some
kind
of
superman
she
gave
his
bicep
a
squeeze
then
his
thigh
then
slapped
his
butt
a
fine
specimen
your
wife
a
lucky
woman
he
grinned
having
his
wife
in
the
conversation
made
him
feel
less
at
risk
right
i
married
and
we
both
know
it
this
is
just
fun
flirting
nothing
more
they
bit
into
their
pupusas
stuffed
cornmeal
dumplings
filled
with
grilled
pork
and
topped
with
shredded
cabbage
and
hot
sauce
and
grunted
and
ate
and
ordered
more
what
are
these
called
again
pupusas
from
el
salvador
humph
in
my
day
we
ate
mexican
burritos
the
size
of
a
football
and
we
were
grateful
no
one
eats
burritos
anymore
he
said
then
covered
his
mouth
aware
of
how
pretentious
that
sounded
dahling
she
said
burritos
are
you
try
a
pupusa
it
what
all
the
most
charming
central
american
peasants
are
eating
now
they
both
laughed
and
stuffed
their
faces
more
well
it
was
either
here
or
one
of
the
fatkins
places
with
the
stuffed
pizzas
and
i
figured
they
really
do
that
the
fatkins
yeah
anything
to
get
that
magical
calories
any
day
it
must
be
the
same
in
russia
right
i
mean
they
invented
it
maybe
for
fifteen
minutes
but
most
of
them
do
bother
they
get
a
little
metabolic
tweak
not
a
throttle
like
that
christ
what
it
must
do
to
your
digestive
system
to
process
calories
a
day
chacun
a
son
gout
he
said
essaying
a
gallic
shrug
she
laughed
again
and
they
ate
some
more
i
starting
to
feel
human
at
last
me
too
it
still
but
my
circadian
thinks
it
i
need
to
do
something
to
stay
awake
or
i
be
up
at
four
tomorrow
morning
i
have
some
modafinil
he
said
swore
off
let
go
for
a
walk
they
did
a
little
more
and
then
headed
into
the
mission
and
the
north
african
tchotchke
emporia
that
were
crowding
out
the
mexican
rodeo
shops
and
hairdressers
the
skin
drums
and
rattles
were
with
intricate
designs
coca
cola
logos
the
un
access
to
essential
medicines
charter
disney
characters
it
put
them
both
in
mind
of
the
old
days
of
the
new
work
and
the
subject
came
up
again
hesitant
at
first
and
then
a
reminisce
suzanne
told
him
stories
of
the
things
that
perry
and
lester
had
done
that
she
never
dared
report
on
the
ways
they
skirted
the
law
and
his
orders
he
told
her
a
few
stories
of
his
own
and
they
rocked
with
laughter
in
the
street
staggering
like
drunks
pounding
each
other
on
the
backs
gripping
their
knees
and
stomachs
and
doubling
over
to
the
curious
glances
of
the
it
was
fine
that
day
landon
thought
some
kind
of
great
sorrow
that
he
forgotten
he
carried
lifted
from
him
and
his
chest
and
shoulders
expanded
and
he
breathed
easy
what
was
the
sorrow
the
death
of
the
new
work
the
death
of
the
the
death
of
everything
he
considered
important
and
worthy
its
fading
into
tawdry
cheap
nostalgia
they
were
sitting
in
the
grass
in
dolores
park
now
watching
the
dogs
and
their
people
romp
among
the
robot
he
had
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
like
on
a
bender
he
told
himself
and
not
like
a
man
flirting
with
a
woman
he
had
seen
in
years
and
then
they
were
lying
down
the
ache
of
laughter
in
their
bellies
the
sun
on
their
faces
the
barks
and
happy
shouts
around
them
their
hands
twined
together
but
that
was
friendly
too
arab
men
held
hands
walking
down
the
street
as
a
way
of
showing
friendship
now
their
talk
had
banked
down
to
coals
throwing
off
an
occasional
spark
when
one
or
the
other
would
remember
some
funny
anecdote
and
grunt
out
a
word
or
two
that
would
set
them
both
to
gingerly
chuckling
but
their
hands
were
tied
and
their
breathing
was
in
sync
and
their
flanks
were
touching
and
it
was
just
friendly
abruptly
she
shook
her
hand
free
and
rolled
on
her
side
listen
married
man
i
think
that
enough
of
that
he
felt
his
face
go
red
his
ears
rang
suzanne
what
he
was
sputtering
no
harm
no
foul
but
let
keep
it
friendly
all
right
the
spell
was
broken
and
the
sorrow
came
back
he
looked
for
the
right
thing
to
say
god
i
miss
it
he
said
oh
suzanne
god
i
miss
it
so

the

the
whole
gang
of
them
really
she
propped
herself
up
on
one
elbow
and
then
shocked
him
by
kissing
him
hard
on
the
cheek
thanks
kettlebelly
thank
you
so
much
for
putting
me
in
the
middle
of
all
that
you
changed
my
life
that
for
sure
he
felt
the
imprint
of
her
lips
glowing
on
his
cheek
and
grinned
ok
here
an
idea
let
go
buy
a
couple
bottles
of
wine
sit
on
my
patio
get
a
glow
on
and
then
call
perry
and
see
what
he
up
to
oh
that
a
good
one
she
said
that
a
good
one
a
few
hours
later
they
sat
on
the
horsehair
in
living
room
and
hit
a
number
he
never
taken
out
of
his
hi
this
is
perry
leave
a
message
perry
they
chorused
they
looked
at
each
other
at
a
loss
for
what
to
say
next
then
dissolved
in
peals
of
laughter
perry
it
suzanne
and
kettlebelly
what
the
hell
are
you
up
to
call
us
they
looked
at
the
phone
with
renewed
hilarity
and
laughed
some
more
but
by
the
time
the
sun
was
setting
over
potrero
hill
and
suzanne
was
beating
her
up
again
they
both
descended
into
their
own
personal
funks
suzanne
went
up
to
the
guest
room
and
put
herself
to
bed
not
bothering
to
brush
her
teeth
or
even
change
into
her
nightie
perry
touched
down
in
miami
in
a
his
eyes
gummed
shut
by
several
days
worth
of
hangovers
chased
by
drink
sleep
deprivation
made
him
uncoordinated
so
he
tripped
twice
deplaning
and
his
voice
was
a
barely
audible
rasp
his
throat
sore
with
a
cold
he
picked
up
in
texas
or
maybe
it
was
oklahoma
lester
was
waiting
beyond
the
luggage
carousels
grinning
like
a
holy
fool
tall
and
and
tanned
dressed
in
fatkins
finery
all
tight
and
glitter
oh
man
you
look
like
shit
he
said
breaking
off
from
the
fatkins
girl
he
been
chatting
up
perry
noticed
that
he
was
holding
his
phone
a
sure
sign
that
he
gotten
her
number
ten
perry
said
grinning
through
the
snotty
rheum
of
his
cold
ten
rides
ten
rides
lester
said
ten
san
francisco
austin
minneapolis
omaha
oklahoma
city
madison
bellingham
chapel
hill
and
he
faltered
and
shit
i
forget
it
all
written
down
lester
took
his
bag
from
him
and
set
it
down
then
crushed
him
in
an
enormous
muscular
hug
that
whiffed
slightly
of
the
ketosis
fumes
that
all
the
fatkins
exuded
you
did
good
cowboy
he
said
let
mosey
back
to
the
ranch
feed
you
and
put
you
to
bed
can
i
sleep
in
of
course
until
april
lester
laughed
and
slipped
one
of
perry
arms
over
his
shoulders
and
picked
up
his
suitcase
and
walked
them
back
through
the
parking
lot
to
his
latest
hotrod
perry
breathed
in
the
hot
wet
air
as
they
went
feeling
it
open
his
chest
and
nasal
passages
his
eyes
were
at
half
mast
but
the
sight
of
the
sickly
roadside
palms
the
wandering
vendors
on
the
traffic
islands
with
their
net
bags
full
of
ipods
and
vpods
he
was
home
and
his
body
knew
it
lester
cooked
him
a
huge
plate
of
scrambled
eggs
with
corned
beef
pastrami
salami
and
cheese
with
a
mountain
of
sauerkraut
on
top
there
you
go
fatten
you
up
you
all
skinny
and
haggard
buddy
lester
was
an
expert
at
throwing
together
meals
on
short
order
perry
stuffed
away
as
much
as
he
could
then
collapsed
on
his
old
bed
with
his
old
sheets
and
his
old
pillows
and
in
seconds
he
was
sleeping
the
best
sleep
he
had
in
months
when
he
woke
the
next
day
his
cold
had
turned
into
a
horrible
wet
crusty
thing
that
practically
had
his
face
glued
to
his
pillow
lester
came
in
took
a
good
look
at
him
and
came
back
with
a
quart
of
fresh
orange
juice
a
pot
of
tea
and
a
stack
of
dry
toast
along
with
a
pack
of
cold
pills
take
of
this
and
then
come
down
to
the
ride
when
ready
i
hold
down
the
fort
for
another
couple
days
if
that
what
it
takes
perry
spent
the
day
in
his
bathrobe
shuttling
between
the
living
room
and
the
on
the
patio
letting
the
heat
bake
some
of
the
snot
out
of
his
head
lester
kindness
and
his
cold
made
him
nostalgic
for
his
youth
when
his
father
doted
on
his
illnesses
perry
father
was
a
little
man
perry
no
giant
himself
was
taller
than
the
old
man
by
the
time
he
turned
his
father
had
always
reminded
him
of
some
clever
furry
animal
a
raccoon
or
badger
he
had
tiny
hands
and
his
movements
were
small
and
precise
and
careful
they
were
mostly
cordial
and
friendly
but
distant
his
father
worked
as
a
manager
in
a
machine
shop
though
he
started
out
his
career
as
a
plain
old
machinist
of
all
the
machinists
he
started
with
at
the
shop
only
he
had
weathered
the
transition
to
the
new
computerized
devices
the
others
had
all
lost
their
jobs
or
taken
early
retirement
or
just
quit
but
his
father
had
taken
to
with
total
abandon
losing
himself
in
the
screens
and
staggering
home
bleary
after
ten
or
fifteen
hours
in
front
of
the
screen
but
that
all
changed
when
perry
took
perry
father
loved
to
play
nurse
he
book
off
from
work
and
stay
home
ferrying
up
gallons
of
tea
and
beef
broth
flat
and
dry
toast
cold
tablets
and
cough
syrup
he
open
the
windows
when
it
was
warm
and
then
run
around
the
house
shutting
them
at
the
first
sign
of
a
cool
breeze
best
of
all
was
what
his
father
would
do
when
perry
got
restless
he
and
perry
would
go
down
to
the
where
the
upright
piano
stood
it
had
been
perry
grandfather
and
the
old
man
died
before
perry
was
born
had
been
a
jazz
pianist
who
played
sessions
with
everyone
from
cab
calloway
to
duke
ellington
you
ready
p
his
father
would
ask
perry
always
nodded
watching
his
father
sit
down
at
the
bench
and
try
a
few
notes
then
his
father
would
play
tinkling
and
then
pounding
running
up
and
down
the
keyboard
in
an
improvised
jazz
recital
that
could
go
for
hours
sometimes
only
ending
once
perry
mom
came
home
from
work
at
the
framing
shop
nothing
in
perry
life
since
had
the
power
to
capture
him
the
way
his
father
music
did
his
fingers
danced
literally
on
the
keys
walking
up
and
down
them
like
a
pair
of
legs
making
little
comedy
movements
the
little
stubby
fingers
with
their
tufts
of
hair
on
the
knuckles
like
goat
legs
nimbly
prancing
and
turning
and
then
there
was
the
perry
sometimes
played
with
the
piano
and
he
figured
out
that
if
you
hit
every
other
key
with
three
fingers
you
got
a
chord
but
perry
dad
almost
never
made
chords
he
made
sounds
that
involved
those
mysterious
black
keys
and
clashed
in
a
way
that
was
not
a
chord
that
jangled
and
jarred
the
made
up
somewhere
in
the
music
there
be
one
or
more
melodies
often
the
stuff
that
perry
listened
to
in
his
room
but
sometimes
old
jazz
and
blues
standards
the
music
would
settle
into
long
runs
of
improvisational
noise
that
was
noise
that
was
the
best
stuff
because
perry
could
never
tell
if
there
was
a
melody
in
there
sometimes
he
be
sure
that
he
had
the
know
of
it
could
tell
what
was
coming
next
a
segue
into
here
comes
the
sun
or
let
the
good
times
roll
or
merrily
we
roll
along
but
then
his
father
would
get
to
that
spot
and
he
move
into
something
else
some
other
latent
pattern
that
was
unmistakable
in
hindsight
there
was
a
joke
his
dad
liked
time
flies
like
an
arrow
fruit
flies
like
a
banana
this
was
funny
in
just
that
way
you
expected
one
thing
you
got
something
else
and
when
your
expectations
fell
apart
like
that
it
was
pure
hilarity
you
wanted
to
clutch
your
sides
and
roll
on
the
floor
sometimes
it
was
so
funny
his
dad
usually
closed
his
eyes
while
he
played
squeezing
them
shut
letting
his
mouth
hang
open
slightly
sometimes
he
grunted
or
scatted
along
with
his
playing
but
more
often
he
grunted
out
something
that
was
kind
of
the
of
what
he
was
playing
just
like
sometimes
the
melody
and
rhythms
he
played
on
the
piano
were
sometimes
the
opposite
of
the
song
he
was
playing
something
that
was
exactly
and
perfectly
opposite
so
you
could
hear
it
without
hearing
the
thing
it
was
the
opposite
of
the
game
would
end
when
his
dad
began
to
improvise
on
parts
of
the
piano
besides
the
keys
knocking
on
it
reaching
in
to
pluck
its
strings
like
a
harp
rattling
perry
teacup
on
its
saucer
just
so
nothing
made
him
feel
better
faster
it
was
a
tonic
a
fine
one
better
than
pills
and
tea
and
toast
daytime
tv
and
flat
as
perry
got
older
he
and
the
old
man
had
their
share
of
fights
over
the
normal
things
girls
partying
school
but
every
time
perry
took
ill
he
was
transported
back
to
his
boyhood
and
those
amazing
piano
recitals
his
father
stubby
fingers
doing
their
comic
and
pratfalls
on
the
keys
the
grunting
in
the
back
of
his
throat
those
crazy
finales
with
teacups
and
piano
strings
now
he
stared
morosely
at
the
empty
swimming
pool
six
stories
below
his
balcony
filled
with
blowing
garbage
leaves
and
a
huge
nest
his
father
music
was
in
his
ears
distantly
now
and
fading
with
his
cold
he
should
call
the
old
man
back
home
in
westchester
county
retired
now
they
talked
only
rarely
these
days
three
or
four
times
a
year
on
birthdays
and
anniversaries
no
fight
had
started
their
silence
only
busy
lives
grown
apart
he
should
call
the
old
man
but
instead
he
got
dressed
and
went
for
a
jog
around
the
block
trying
to
get
the
wet
sick
wheeze
out
of
his
whistling
breath
stopping
a
couple
times
to
blow
his
nose
the
sun
was
like
a
blowtorch
on
his
hair
which
had
grown
out
of
his
normal
duckling
fuzz
into
something
much
shaggier
his
head
baked
the
cold
baked
with
it
and
by
the
time
he
got
home
and
chugged
a
quart
of
orange
juice
he
was
feeling
fully
human
again
and
ready
for
a
shower
street
clothes
and
a
turn
at
the
old
at
work
the
queue
snaked
all
the
way
through
the
market
and
out
to
the
street
where
the
line
had
a
casual
party
kind
of
atmosphere
the
market
kids
were
doing
a
brisk
business
in
popsicles
homemade
colas
and
clever
origami
stools
and
made
from
recycled
cardboard
some
of
the
kids
recognized
him
and
waved
then
returned
to
their
hustle
he
followed
the
queue
through
the
stalls
the
vendors
were
happier
than
the
kids
if
that
was
possible
selling
stuff
as
fast
as
they
could
set
it
out
the
queue
had
every
conceivable
kind
of
person
in
it
old
and
young
hipsters
and
conservative
rawboned
southerners
latina
moms
with
their
babies
urban
homeboys
crackers
and
miami
beach
queers
in
pastel
shorts
there
were
old
jewish
couples
and
smartly
turned
out
european
tourists
with
their
funny
shag
cuts
and
the
filter
masks
that
they
smoked
around
there
was
a
korean
tour
group
of
the
sort
he
seen
now
and
again
in
disney
world
led
by
a
smart
lady
in
a
sweltering
little
suit
holding
an
umbrella
over
her
head
lester
what
the
he
said
grinning
and
laughing
as
he
clapped
lester
on
the
shoulder
taking
a
young
five
bucks
out
of
a
hand
whose
fingernails
were
painted
with
chipped
black
polish
what
the
hell
is
going
on
here
lester
laughed
i
was
saving
this
for
a
surprise
buddy
record
crowds
growing
every
day
there
a
line
up
in
the
morning
no
matter
how
early
i
open
and
no
matter
what
time
i
close
i
turn
people
away
how
they
all
find
out
about
it
lester
shrugged
word
of
mouth
he
said
best
advertising
you
can
have
shit
perry
you
just
got
back
from
ten
cities
where
they
want
to
clone
this
thing
how
did
find
out
about
it
perry
shook
his
head
and
marveled
at
the
queue
some
more
the
korean
tour
group
was
coming
up
on
them
and
perry
nudged
lester
aside
and
got
out
his
the
familiar
movements
lovely
after
all
that
time
on
the
road
the
tour
guide
put
a
stack
of
twenties
down
on
the
counter
i
got
fifty
of
she
said
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
bucks
she
had
an
american
accent
somewhere
south
of
the
line
perry
had
been
expecting
a
korean
accent
broken
english
perry
riffled
the
bills
i
take
your
word
for
it
she
winked
at
him
they
got
off
the
plane
and
they
were
all
like
disney
we
have
one
of
those
in
seoul
what
so
i
took
them
here
you
guys
totally
rock
he
could
have
kissed
her
his
heart
took
wing
in
you

he
said
lester
will
get
you
the
extra
ride
vehicles
they
all
in
there
already
he
said
i
been
running
the
whole
fleet
for
two
weeks
and
i
got
ten
more
on
order
perry
whistled
you
shoulda
said
he
said
then
turned
back
to
the
tour
guide
it
might
be
a
little
bit
of
a
wait
ten
fifteen
minutes
lester
said
no
she
said
they
wait
till
kingdom
come
provided
there
good
shopping
to
be
had
indeed
the
tour
group
was
at
the
center
of
a
pack
of
hawking
busts
and
tattoos
contacts
and
kitchenware
and
cigarette
lighters
once
she
was
gone
lester
gave
his
shoulder
another
squeeze
i
hired
two
more
kids
to
bring
the
ride
cars
back
around
to
the
entrance
when
perry
had
left
that
had
been
a
chore
something
you
did
before
shutting
down
for
the
night
holy
crap
perry
said
watching
the
tour
group
edge
toward
the
entrance
slip
inside
in
ones
and
twos
it
amazing
is
it
lester
said
and
wait
till
you
see
the
ride
perry
did
get
a
chance
to
ride
until
much
later
that
day
once
the
sun
had
set
and
the
last
had
been
shut
and
the
last
rider
had
been
chased
home
when
he
and
lester
slugged
back
bottles
of
flat
distilled
water
from
their
and
sat
on
the
ticket
counter
to
get
the
weight
off
their
tired
feet
now
we
ride
lester
said
you
going
to
this
the
first
thing
he
noticed
was
that
the
ride
had
become
a
lot
less
open
when
he
left
there
been
the
sense
that
you
were
in
a
giant
room
all
that
dead
with
little
exhibits
spread
around
it
like
the
at
a
show
but
now
the
exhibits
had
been
arranged
out
of
one
another
and
some
of
the
taller
pieces
had
been
upended
to
form
baffles
it
was
much
more
like
a
carny
haunted
house
floor
now
the
car
circled
slowly
in
the
first
room
which
had
accumulated
a
lot
of
junk
that
was
mad
inventions
from
the
heyday
of
new
work
there
was
a
chipped
and
a
small
collection
of
girls
dolls
a
purse
spilled
on
the
floor
with
photos
of
young
girls
clowning
at
a
birthday
party
he
reached
for
the
joystick
with
irritation
and
slammed
it
toward
minus
one
what
the
hell
was
this
crap
next
was
a
room
full
of
boys
tanks
and
cars
and
trading
cards
some
in
careful
packages
and
frames
some
lovingly
scuffed
and
beaten
up
they
were
from
all
eras
and
he
recognized
some
of
his
beloved
toys
from
his
own
boyhood
among
the
mix
the
items
were
arranged
in
concentric
rings
one
of
the
robots
default
patterns
for
displaying
materials
around
a
writhing
tower
of
juddering
shuddering
domestic
robots
that
had
piled
one
atop
the
other
the
vogue
for
these
had
been
mercifully
brief
but
it
had
been
intense
and
for
perry
the
juxtaposition
of
the
cars
and
the
cards
the
tanks
and
the
robots
made
something
catch
in
his
throat
there
was
a
statement
here
about
the
drive
to
automate
household
chores
and
the
simple
pleasure
of
rolling
an
imaginary
tank
over
the
imaginary
armies
of
your
imaginary
enemies
so
too
something
about
the
collecting
urge
the
need
to
get
every
card
in
a
set
and
then
to
get
each
in
perfect
condition
and
then
to
arrange
them
in
perfect
order
and
then
to
forget
them
altogether
his
hand
had
been
jerking
the
joystick
to
plus
one
all
this
time
and
now
he
became
consciously
aware
of
this
the
next
room
had
many
of
the
old
inventions
he
remembered
but
they
were
arranged
not
on
gleaming
silver
tables
but
were
mixed
in
with
heaps
of
clothing
mountains
of
the
brightly
colored
ubiquitous
that
had
gone
hand
in
hand
with
every
new
work
invention
and
crew
mixed
in
among
them
were
some
vintage
tees
from
the
dotcom
era
and
perched
on
top
of
the
mountain
staring
glassily
at
him
was
a
little
that
looked
familiar
he
was
almost
certain
that
seen
her
in
the
first
doll
room
the
next
room
was
built
out
of
pieces
of
the
old
kitchen
display
but
there
was
disarray
now
dishes
in
the
sink
and
a
plate
on
the
counter
with
a
cigarette
butted
out
in
the
middle
of
it
another
plate
lay
in
three
pieces
on
the
linoleum
before
it
the
next
room
was
carpeted
with
flattened
soda
tins
that
crunched
under
the
chair
wheels
in
the
center
of
them
a
neat
workbench
with
ranked
tools
the
ride
went
on
and
on
each
room
utterly
different
from
how
left
it
but
somehow
familiar
too
the
ride
he
left
had
celebrated
the
new
work
and
the
people
who
made
it
happen
and
so
did
this
ride
but
this
ride
was
less
linear
less
about
display
more
it
a
story
he
said
when
he
got
off
i
think
so
too
lester
said
it
been
getting
more
and
more
the
way
that
doll
keeps
reappearing
i
think
that
someone
had
like
ten
of
them
and
just
tossed
them
out
at
regular
intervals
and
then
the
snuck
one
into
every
scene
it
got
scenes
that
what
they
are
scenes
it
like
a
disney
ride
one
of
those
dark
rides
in
fantasyland
except
those
suck
and
our
ride
rocks
it
more
like
pirates
of
the
caribbean
have
it
your
way
whatever
how
freaking
weird
is
that
not
so
weird
people
see
stories
like
they
see
faces
in
clouds
once
we
gave
them
the
ability
to
subtract
the
stuff
that
felt
wrong
and
reinforce
the
stuff
that
felt
right
it
was
only
natural
that
anthropomorphize
the
world
into
a
story
perry
shook
his
head
you
think
we
have
this
guy
a
cultural
studies
prof
who
comes
practically
every
day
he
been
telling
me
all
about
it
stories
are
how
we
understand
the
world
and
technology
is
how
we
choose
our
stories
check
out
the
greeks
all
those
greek
plays
they
end
with
the
ex
the
playwright
gets
tired
of
writing
so
he
trots
a
god
out
on
stage
to
simply
point
a
finger
at
the
players
and
make
it
all
better
you
ca
do
that
in
a
story
today
but
back
then
they
have
the
tools
to
help
them
observe
and
record
the
world
so
as
far
as
they
could
tell
that
how
stuff
worked
today
we
understand
a
little
more
about
the
world
so
our
stories
are
about
people
figuring
out
what
causing
their
troubles
and
changing
stuff
so
that
those
causes
go
away
causal
stories
for
a
causal
universe
thinking
about
the
world
in
terms
of
causes
and
effects
makes
you
seek
out
causes
and
effects
even
where
there
are
none
watch
how
gamblers
play
that
weird
feeling
that
the
roulette
wheel
came
up
black
a
third
time
in
a
row
so
the
next
spin
will
make
it
red
it
not
superstition
it
kind
of
the
it
causality
run
amok
so
this
is
the
story
that
has
emerged
from
our
collective
unconscious
lester
laughed
that
a
little
pretentious
i
think
it
more
like
those
japanese
crabs
which
japanese
crabs
were
you
there
when
tjan
was
talking
about
this
or
was
that
in
russia
anyway
there
are
these
crabs
in
japan
and
if
they
have
anything
that
looks
like
a
face
on
the
backs
of
their
shells
the
fishermen
throw
them
back
because
it
bad
luck
to
eat
a
crab
with
a
face
on
its
shell
so
the
crabs
with
shells
have
more
babies
which
means
that
gradually
the
crabs
shells
get
more
since
all
shells
are
eliminated
from
the
this
leads
the
fishermen
to
raise
the
bar
on
their
selection
criteria
so
they
will
eat
crabs
with
shells
that
are
a
little
but
not
so
all
the
slightly
are
eliminated
leaving
behind
moderately
shells
this
gets
repeated
over
several
generations
and
now
you
got
these
crabs
that
have
vivid
faces
on
their
shells
we
let
our
riders
eliminate
all
the
elements
from
the
ride
and
so
what
left
behind
is
more
and
more
but
the
lever
is
too
crude
for
this
right
we
should
give
them
a
pointer
or
something
so
they
can
specify
individual
elements
they
do
like
you
want
to
encourage
this
do
you
lester
nodded
vigorously
of
course
i
do
i
just
thought
that
be
a
little
less
enthusiastic
about
it
you
know
because
so
much
of
the
new
work
stuff
is
being
you
kidding
this
is
what
the
new
work
was
all
about
group
creation
i
could
be
happier
about
it
seriously
this
is
so
much
cooler
than
anything
that
i
could
have
built
and
now
with
the
network
coming
online
soon
wow
imagine
it
it
going
to
be
so
fucking
weird
bro
amen
lester
said
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
yelped
shit
late
for
a
date
can
you
get
yourself
home
sure
perry
said
brought
my
wheels
see
you
later
have
a
good
one
she
amazing
lester
said
used
to
weigh
pounds
and
was
shut
in
for
ten
years
man
has
she
got
an
imagination
on
her
she
can
do
this
thing
perry
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
la
la
la
i
not
listening
to
you
tmi
lester
seriously
way
way
tmi
lester
shook
his
head
you
are
such
a
prude
dude
perry
thought
about
hilda
for
a
fleeting
moment
and
then
grinned
that
me
a
total
puritan
go
be
safe
safe
sound
and
slippery
lester
said
and
got
in
his
car
perry
looked
around
at
the
shuttered
market
rooftops
glinting
in
the
rosy
tropical
sunset
man
he
missed
those
sunsets
he
snorted
up
damp
lungsful
of
the
tropical
air
and
smelled
dinners
cooking
at
the
shantytown
across
the
street
it
was
different
and
bigger
and
more
elaborate
every
time
he
visited
it
which
was
always
less
often
than
he
wished
there
was
a
good
barbecue
place
there
dirty
max
just
a
hole
in
the
wall
with
a
pit
out
back
and
the
friendliest
people
there
was
always
a
mob
scene
around
there
locals
greasy
from
the
ribs
in
their
hands
a
big
bucket
overflowing
with
discarded
bones
wandering
towards
it
he
was
amazed
by
how
much
bigger
it
had
grown
since
his
last
visit
most
buildings
had
had
two
stories
though
a
few
had
three
now
almost
all
had
four
leaning
drunkenly
toward
each
other
across
the
streets
power
cables
network
cables
and
clotheslines
gave
the
overhead
spaces
the
look
of
a
carelessly
spun
spider
web
the
new
stories
were
most
remarkable
because
of
what
francis
had
explained
to
him
about
the
way
that
additional
stories
got
added
most
people
rented
out
or
sold
the
right
to
build
on
top
of
their
buildings
and
then
the
new
upstairs
neighbors
in
turn
sold
rights
on
sometimes
you
get
a
dweller
want
to
build
atop
two
adjacent
buildings
to
make
an
apartment
for
a
big
family
and
that
required
negotiating
with
all
of
the
owners
of
each
floor
of
both
buildings
just
looking
at
it
made
his
head
hurt
with
all
the
tangled
property
and
ownership
relationships
embodied
in
the
high
spaces
he
heard
the
easy
chatter
out
the
open
windows
and
music
and
crying
babies
kids
ran
through
the
streets
laughing
and
chasing
each
other
or
bouncing
balls
or
playing
some
kind
of
networked
rpg
with
their
phones
that
had
them
peeking
around
corners
seeing
another
player
and
shrieking
and
running
off
the
at
the
barbecue
joint
greeted
him
by
name
and
the
men
and
women
around
it
made
space
for
him
it
was
friendly
and
companionable
and
after
a
moment
francis
wandered
up
with
a
couple
of
his
proteges
they
carried
boxes
of
beer
hey
hey
francis
said
home
again
huh
home
again
perry
said
he
wiped
off
his
fingers
and
shook
francis
hand
warmly
god
i
missed
this
place
we
missed
having
you
francis
said
big
crowds
across
the
way
too
seems
like
you
hit
on
something
perry
shook
his
head
and
smiled
and
ate
his
ribs
what
the
story
around
here
lots
and
lots
francis
said
there
a
whole
thing
happening
lots
of
traffic
on
the
aarp
from
other
people
setting
these
up
around
the
country
so
you
hit
on
something
too
naw
when
it
railroading
time
you
get
railroads
when
squatter
time
you
get
squats
you
know
they
want
to
open
a
here
no
perry
laughed
and
choked
on
ribs
and
then
guzzled
some
beer
to
wash
it
all
down
francis
put
a
wrinkled
hand
over
his
heart
he
still
wore
his
wedding
band
perry
saw
despite
his
wife
being
gone
for
decades
i
swear
it
just
there
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
busier
corners
and
we
told
them
to
fuck
off
francis
said
we
got
lots
of
businesses
around
here
that
do
everything
a
could
do
for
us
without
taking
the
wealth
out
of
our
community
and
sending
it
to
some
corporate
some
soreheads
wanted
to
see
how
much
money
we
could
get
out
of
them
but
i
just
kept
telling
them
whatever
gives
us
it
only
be
because
they
think
they
can
get
more
of
they
saw
reason
besides
i
in
charge
i
always
win
my
arguments
you
are
the
most
benevolent
of
dictators
perry
said
he
began
to
work
on
another
beer
beer
tasted
better
outside
in
the
heat
and
the
barbecue
smoke
i
glad
someone
thinks
so
francis
said
oh
the
thing
left
a
lot
of
people
pissed
at
me
there
plenty
around
here
that
do
remember
the
way
it
started
off
to
them
just
some
alter
kocker
who
keeping
them
down
is
it
serious
perry
knew
that
there
was
the
potential
for
serious
major
lawlessness
from
his
little
settlement
it
was
a
failing
condo
complex
rented
out
to
filipina
domestics
and
weird
entrepreneurs
like
him
it
was
a
place
where
the
cops
would
love
an
excuse
to
come
in
with
riot
batons
his
funny
eyebrow
twitched
and
gas
the
kind
of
place
where
there
almost
certainly
were
a
few
very
bad
people
living
their
lives
miami
had
bad
people
too
but
the
bad
people
in
miami
were
his
problem
and
the
bad
people
and
the
potential
chaos
were
what
he
loved
about
the
place
too
he
grown
up
in
the
kind
of
place
where
everything
was
predictable
and
safe
and
he
hated
every
minute
of
it
the
glorious
chaos
around
him
was
just
as
he
liked
it
the
curled
up
his
nose
fragrant
and
i
do
know
anymore
i
thought
i
retire
and
settle
down
and
take
up
painting
now
i
basically
a
mob
boss
not
the
bad
kind
but
still
it
a
lot
of
work
pimpin
ai
easy
perry
saw
the
shocked
look
on
francis
face
and
added
hastily
sorry
not
calling
you
a
pimp
it
a
song
lyric
is
all
we
got
pimps
here
now
whores
too
you
name
it
we
got
it
still
a
good
place
to
live
better
than
miami
if
you
ask
me
but
it
could
go
real
animal
bad
bad
animal
hard
to
believe
standing
there
in
the
licking
his
fingers
drinking
his
beer
his
cold
seemed
to
have
been
baked
out
by
the
steamy
swampy
heat
well
francis
if
anyone
knows
how
to
keep
peace
it
you
social
workers
come
around
say
the
same
thing
but
there
people
around
here
with
little
kids
they
worry
that
the
social
workers
could
force
them
out
take
away
their
children
it
was
like
francis
to
complain
like
this
it
was
in
his
nature
but
here
it
was
the
strain
of
running
things
was
showing
on
him
perry
wondered
if
his
own
strain
was
showing
that
way
did
he
complain
more
these
days
maybe
he
did
an
uncomfortable
silence
descended
upon
them
perry
drank
his
beer
morosely
he
thought
of
how
ridiculous
it
was
to
be
morose
about
the
possibility
that
he
was
being
morose
but
there
you
had
it
finally
his
phone
rang
and
saved
him
from
further
conversation
he
looked
at
the
display
and
shook
his
head
it
was
kettlewell
again
that
first
voicemail
had
made
him
laugh
aloud
but
when
they
had
called
back
for
a
couple
days
he
figured
that
they
had
just
had
a
little
too
much
wine
and
placed
the
call
now
they
were
calling
back
and
it
was
still
pretty
early
on
the
west
coast
too
early
for
them
to
have
had
too
much
wine
unless
really
changed
perry
perry
perry
it
was
kettlebelly
he
sounded
like
he
might
be
drunk
or
merely
with
excitement
perry
remembered
that
he
got
that
way
sometimes
kettlewell
how
are
you
doing
i
here
too
perry
i
cashed
in
my
return
ticket
suzanne
yeah
she
said
she
too
sounded
punchy
like
they
been
having
a
fit
of
the
giggles
just
before
calling
kettlewell
family
have
taken
me
in
wayward
wanderer
that
i
am
you
two
sound
pretty
um
happy
we
been
having
an
amazing
time
kettlewell
said
his
speakerphone
made
him
sound
like
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
mostly
reminiscing
about
you
guys
what
the
hell
are
you
up
to
we
tried
to
follow
it
on
the
net
but
it
all
jumbled
what
this
about
a
story
i
keep
reading
about
this
ride
of
yours
and
its
story
i
make
any
sense
of
it
i
have
read
any
of
this
but
lester
and
i
were
talking
about
some
stuff
to
do
with
stories
tonight
i
did
know
anyone
else
was
talking
about
this
though
where
you
see
it
i
email
it
to
you
suzanne
said
i
was
going
to
blog
it
tonight
anyway
so
you
two
are
just
hanging
around
san
francisco
giggling
and
walking
down
memory
lane
well
yeah
it
about
time
too
we
all
been
separated
for
too
long
we
want
a
reunion
perry
a
reunion
we
want
to
come
down
for
a
visit
and
see
what
you
doing
and
hang
out
you
would
believe
how
much
fun
we
been
having
perry
seriously
kettlewell
sounded
like
he
been
huffing
nitrous
or
something
have
been
having
fun
he
thought
about
the
question
um
kind
of
he
told
them
about
his
travels
a
quick
thumbnail
sketch
struggling
to
remember
which
city
he
been
to
when
leaving
out
the
crazy
sex
which
came
back
to
him
in
a
rush
that
night
with
hilda
in
the
coffin
like
a
warm
hallucination
on
balance
yes
it
been
fun
right
so
we
want
to
come
down
and
have
fun
with
you
and
lester
still
hanging
around
right
lester
had
told
him
about
the
history
he
had
with
suzanne
and
there
was
something
in
the
way
she
asked
after
lester
that
suggested
to
perry
that
there
was
still
something
there
you
kidding
you
have
to
pry
us
apart
with
a
crowbar
see
i
told
you
so
suzanne
said
this
guy
thought
that
lester
might
have
gotten
bored
and
wandered
off
never
plus
anyone
who
follows
his
message
board
traffic
and
blogs
would
know
that
he
was
right
here
minding
the
shop
and
reading
his
blog
are
you
suzanne
he
did
need
to
say
it
he
could
almost
hear
her
blush
over
the
line
so
how
about

what
for
us
coming
to
town

wife

the
morning
flight
and
be
there
for
breakfast

a
good
hotel

coffin

perry
heart
beat
faster
he
did
miss
these
two
and
they
were
so
punchy
so
gleeful
he
love
to
see
them
he
muted
his
phone
hey
francis

guesthouse
down
the
road

still
running
lulu
sure
they
just
built
another
storey
and
took
over
the
top
floor
of
the
place
next
door
perfect
he
unmuted
how
you
like
to
stay
in
a
squatter
guesthouse
in
the
shantytown
um
kettlewell
said
but
suzanne
laughed
oh

she
said

your
face

an
we

kettlewell
said

a
reservation

long
are
you
staying
until
we

suzanne
said

perry
said
and
laughed
himself
they
were
different
people
these
two
from
the
people
he
remembered
but
they
were
also
old
friends
and
they
were
coming
to
see
him
tomorrow
ok
lem
me
go
make
your
reservations
francis
walked
him
over
and
the
landlord
fussed
over
the
two
of
them
like
they
were
visiting
dignitaries
perry
looked
the
place
over
and
it
was
completely
charming
he
spotted
what
he
thought
was
probably
a
hooker
and
a
trick
taking
a
room
for
the
night
but
you
got
that
at
the
hilton
too
by
the
time
he
got
home
he
was
sure
that
he
sleep
like
a
log
he
could
barely
keep
his
eyes
open
on
the
drive
but
after
he
climbed
into
bed
and
closed
his
eyes
he
found
that
he
could
sleep
at
all
something
about
being
back
in
his
own
room
in
his
own
bed
felt
alien
and
exciting
he
got
up
and
paced
the
apartment
and
then
lester
came
home
from
his
date
with
the
fatkins
nympho
full
of
improbable
stories
and
covered
in
little
hickeys
you
wo
believe
who
coming
for
a
visit
perry
said
steve
jobs
he
come
down
from
the
lamasery
and
renounced
buddhism
he
wants
to
give
a
free
computer
to
every
visitor
close
perry
said
kettlebelly

suzanne
church

for
a
stay
of
unspecified
duration

reunion

a
you
big
sonofabitch
woot
woot
perry
did
a
little
a
reunion
lester
looked
confused
for
a
second
and
then
for
another
second
he
looked
what
upset
and
then
he
was
grinning
and
jumping
up
and
down
with
perry
reunion
he
felt
like
he
barely
gotten
to
sleep
when
his
phone
rang
the
clock
showed
six
am
and
it
was
kettlebelly
and
suzanne
bleary
and
grouchy
from
their
security
processing
we
want

suzanne
said

got
ta
open
the
ride

he
said
come
kettlebelly
kids

and
his
wife
looks
like
she
ready
to
eat
it
been
years
dude
get
your
ass
in
the
shower
and
down
to
the
international
house
of
pancakes
lester
did
rouse
easy
but
perry
knew
all
the
tricks
for
getting
his
old
pal
out
of
bed
they
were
practically
married
after
all
they
arrived
just
in
time
for
the
morning
rush
but
tony
greeted
them
with
a
smile
and
sent
them
straight
to
the
front
of
the
line
lester
ordered
his
usual
bring
me
three
pounds
of
candy
with
a
side
of
ground
animal
parts
and
potatoes
and
they
waited
nervously
for
suzanne
and
the
clan
kettlewell
to
turn
up
they
arrived
in
a
huge
bustle
of
taxis
and
luggage
and
two
children
hanging
off
of
kettlewell
and
mrs
kettlewell
whom
neither
of
them
had
ever
met
she
was
a
small
youthful
woman
in
her
with
artfully
styled
hair
and
big
abstract
chunky
silver
jewelry
suzanne
had
gone
all
eurochic
and
smoking
with
quiet
understated
dark
clothes
kettlewell
had
a
real
daddy
belly
on
him
now
a
little
pot
that
his
daughter
thumped
rhythmically
from
her
perch
on
his
hip
sit
sit
perry
said
to
them
getting
up
to
help
them
stack
their
luggage
at
either
end
of
the
long
table
down
the
middle
of
the
ihop
big
family
groups
with
tons
of
luggage
were
par
for
the
course
in
florida
so
they
did
really
draw
much
attention
beyond
mild
irritation
from
the
patrons
they
jostled
as
they
got
everyone
seated
perry
was
mildly
amused
to
see
that
lester
and
suzanne
ended
up
sitting
next
to
one
another
and
were
already
chatting
avidly
and
close
up
in
soft
voices
that
they
had
to
lean
in
very
tight
to
hear
he
was
next
to
mrs
kettlewell
whose
name
it
transpired
was
eva
as
in
activity
she
said
geeking
out
with
him
kettlewell
was
in
the
bathroom
with
his
daughter
and
son
and
mrs
kettlewell
eva
seemed
relieved
at
the
chance
for
a
little
adult
conversation
you
must
be
a
very
patient
woman
perry
said
laughing
at
all
the
ticklish
noise
and
motion
of
their
group
oh
that
me
all
right
eva
said
patience
is
my
virtue
and
you
oh
patience
is
something
i
value
very
much
in
other
people
perry
said
it
made
eva
laugh
which
showed
off
her
pretty
and
dimples
he
could
see
how
this
woman
and
kettlewell
must
complement
each
other
she
rocked
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
took
a
long
swig
of
the
coffee
that
their
waiter
had
distributed
around
the
table
topping
up
from
the
carafe
he
left
behind
thank
god
for
legal
stimulants
long
flight
traveling
with
larvae
is
always
a
challenge
she
said
but
they
dug
it
hard
you
should
have
seen
them
at
the
windows
they
never
been
on
a
plane
before
i
like
to
go
camping
she
said
with
a
shrug
landon
always
on
me
to
take
the
kids
to
hawaii
or
whatever
but
i
always
like
you
spend
half
your
fucking
life
in
a
tin
can
why
do
you
want
to
start
your
holidays
in
one
let
go
to
yosemite
and
get
muddy
i
even
taken
them
to
disneyland
perry
put
the
back
of
his
hand
to
his
forehead
that
heresy
around
here
he
said
you
going
to
take
them
to
disney
world
while
in
florida
it
a
lot
bigger
you
know
and
it
a
different
division
really
different
feel
or
so
i
told
you
kidding
perry
we
came
here
for
ride
it
famous
you
know
maybe
a
little
he
felt
his
cheeks
burning
well
there
will
be
one
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
soon
enough
he
told
her
about
the
burning
man
collective
and
the
plan
to
build
one
down
the
south
of
san
francisco
international
kettlebelly
returned
then
with
the
kids
and
he
managed
to
get
them
into
their
seats
while
sucking
back
a
coffee
and
eating
a
biscuit
from
the
basket
in
the
center
of
the
table
breaking
off
bits
to
shove
in
the
kids
mouths
whenever
they
protested
these
are
some
way
tired
kids
he
said
leaning
over
to
give
his
wife
a
kiss
perry
thought
he
saw
suzanne
flick
a
look
at
them
then
but
it
might
have
been
his
imagination
suzanne
and
lester
were
off
in
their
own
world
after
all
the
plane
almost
crashed
said
the
little
girl
next
to
perry
she
had
a
halo
of
curly
hair
like
a
dandelion
clock
and
big
solemn
dark
eyes
and
a
big
wet
mouth
set
between
cheeks
did
it
really
perry
said
she
was
seven
or
eight
he
thought
the
bossy
big
sister
who
been
giving
orders
to
her
little
brother
from
the
moment
they
came
through
the
door
she
nodded
solemnly
he
looked
at
eva
who
shrugged
really
he
said
really
she
said
nodding
vigorously
now
there
were
terrists
on
the
plane
who
wanted
to
blow
it
up
but
the
sky
marshas
stopped
them
how
could
you
tell
they
were
she
clicked
her
tongue
and
rolled
her
eyes
they
were
she
said
just
like
on
president
and
the
freedom
he
knew
something
of
this
cartoon
mostly
because
of
all
the
merch
for
sale
in
the
market
stalls
in
front
of
the
ride
i
see
he
said
well
i
glad
the
sky
marshas
stopped
them
do
you
want
pancakes
i
want
caramel
apple
chocolate
pancakes
with
blueberry
banana
sauce
she
said
rolling
one
pudgy
finger
along
the
description
in
the
glossy
menu
beneath
an
oozing
photo
and
my
brother
wants
a
chocolate
milkshake
and
a
short
stack
of
happy
face
clown
waffles
with
strawberry
sauce
but
not
too
many
because
he
still
a
baby
and
eat
much
you
become
as
fat
as
your
daddy
if
you
eat
like
that
perry
said
eva
snorted
beside
him
no
she
said
i
gon
na
be
a
fatkins
i
see
he
said
eva
shook
her
head
it
the
goddamned
fatkins
agitprop
games
eva
said
they
come
free
with
everything
now
digital
cameras
phones
even
in
cereal
boxes
you
have
to
eat
a
minimum
number
of
calories
per
level
or
you
starve
to
death
this
one
is
a
champeen
i
nationally
ranked
the
little
girl
said
not
looking
up
from
the
menu
perry
looked
across
the
table
and
discovered
that
suzanne
had
covered
lester
hand
with
hers
and
that
lester
was
laughing
along
with
her
at
something
funny
something
about
that
made
him
a
little
freaked
out
like
lester
was
making
time
with
his
sister
or
their
mom
suzanne
he
said
what
happening
with
you
these
days
anyway
petersburg
is
what
happening
with
me
she
said
with
a
hoarse
little
chuckle
petersburg
is
like
detroit
crossed
with
paris
completely
decrepit
and
decadent
there
a
serial
killer
been
working
the
streets
for
five
years
there
and
the
biggest
obstacle
to
catching
him
is
that
the
first
cops
on
the
scene
let
rubberneckers
bribe
them
to
take
home
evidence
as
souvenirs
no
way
lester
said
oh
da
big
vay
she
said
dropping
into
a
comical
boris
and
natasha
accent
bolshoi
vay
so
why
are
you
there
it
like
home
for
me
it
got
enough
of
detroit
old
brutal
earthy
feel
plus
enough
of
silicon
valley
manic
hustle
it
just
feels
right
you
going
to
settle
in
there
well
put
that
way
no
i
could
hack
it
for
the
long
term
but
at
this
time
in
my
life
it
been
just
right
but
it
good
to
get
back
to
the
states
too
i
thinking
of
hanging
out
here
for
a
couple
months
russia
so
cheap
i
got
a
ton
saved
up
might
as
well
blow
it
before
inflation
kills
it
you
keep
your
money
in
rubles
hell
no
no
one
uses
rubles
except
tourists
i
worried
about
another
run
of
inflation
i
mean
have
you
looked
around
lately
you
living
in
a
third
world
country
buddy
a
waiter
came
between
them
handing
out
heaping
steaming
plates
of
food
lester
who
finished
his
first
breakfast
while
they
waited
had
ordered
a
second
breakfast
which
arrived
along
with
the
rest
of
them
mountains
of
food
stacked
up
on
the
table
crowding
jugs
of
apple
juice
and
carafes
of
coffee
incredibly
the
food
kept
coming
multiple
plates
of
baskets
of
biscuits
and
bowls
of
white
sausage
gravy
perry
had
paid
much
attention
when
orders
were
being
taken
but
from
the
looks
of
things
he
was
eating
with
a
bunch
of
ihop
virgins
unaccustomed
to
the
astonishing
portions
to
be
had
there
he
cocked
his
funny
eyebrow
at
suzanne
who
laughed
ok
not
quite
a
country
but
not
a
real
industrial
nation
anymore
either
maybe
more
like
the
of
rome
or
something
drowning
in
wealth
and
wallowing
in
poverty
she
forked
up
a
mouthful
of
hash
browns
and
chased
them
with
coffee
perry
attacked
his
own
plate
kettlewell
fed
the
kids
sneaking
bites
while
eva
looked
on
approvingly
you
a
good
man
landon
kettlewell
she
said
slicing
up
her
steak
and
eggs
into
small
precise
cubes
wielding
the
knife
like
an
artist
you
just
enjoy
your
breakfast
my
queen
he
said
spooning
oatmeal
with
raisins
bananas
granola
and
boysenberry
jam
into
the
little
boy
mouth
we
got
you
presents
the
little
girl
said
taking
a
break
from
shoveling
caramel
apples
into
her
mouth
really
perry
raised
his
funny
eyebrow
and
she
giggled
he
did
it
again
making
it
writhe
like
a
snake
she
snarfed
across
the
table
then
scooped
it
up
and
put
it
back
in
her
mouth
she
nodded
vigorously
dad
give
them
their
presents
kettlewell
said
someone
has
to
feed
your
brother
you
know
i
do
it
she
said
she
forked
up
some
of
his
oatmeal
and
attempted
to
get
it
into
the
little
boy
face
presents
kettlewell
dug
through
the
under
the
table
and
came
up
with
an
overstuffed
diaper
bag
then
pawed
through
it
for
a
long
time
urged
on
by
his
daughter
who
kept
chanting
presents
presents
presents
while
attempting
to
feed
her
little
brother
eva
and
lester
and
suzanne
took
up
the
chant
they
were
drawing
stares
from
nearby
tables
but
perry
did
mind
he
was
laughing
so
hard
his
sides
hurt
finally
kettlewell
held
a
paper
bag
aloft
triumphantly
then
clapped
a
hand
over
his
daughter
mouth
and
shushed
the
rest
you
guys
are
really
hard
to
shop
for
he
said
what
the
hell
do
you
get
for
two
guys
who
not
only
have
everything
but
everything
suzanne
nodded
damned
right
we
spent
a
whole
day
looking
for
something
what
is
it
well
kettlewell
said
we
figured
that
it
should
be
something
useful
not
decorative
you
guys
have
decorative
coming
out
of
your
asses
so
that
left
us
with
tools
we
wanted
to
find
you
a
tool
that
you
did
have
and
that
you
would
appreciate
suzanne
picked
up
the
story
i
thought
we
should
get
you
an
antique
tool
something
so
that
it
was
still
usable
but
to
be
useful
it
had
to
be
something
no
one
had
improved
on
and
that
had
in
fact
been
degraded
by
modern
manufacturing
techniques
at
first
we
looked
at
old
but
i
remembered
that
you
guys
were
mostly
using
keychain
laser
these
days
screwdrivers
pliers
and
hammers
were
all
out
i
find
a
damned
thing
that
looked
any
better
than
what
you
had
around
here
the
state
of
the
art
is
genuinely
progressing
there
were
a
lot
of
nice
old
brass
and
but
they
were
more
decorative
than
useful
by
a
damned
sight
great
old
steel
looked
cool
but
they
weighed
about
a
hundred
times
what
the
safety
helmets
around
here
weigh
we
were
going
to
give
in
and
try
to
bring
you
guys
a
big
goddamned
or
maybe
some
inuit
glass
knives
but
i
did
see
you
having
much
of
a
use
for
either
which
is
how
we
came
to
give
up
on
tools
per
se
and
switched
over
to
leisure
sports
tools
there
was
a
much
richer
vein
wooden
bats
oh
yes
and
real
pigskin
footballs
that
had
nice
idiosyncratic
spin
that
you
have
to
learn
to
compensate
for
but
when
we
found
these
we
knew
we
hit
she
picked
up
kettlewell
paper
sack
with
a
flourish
and
unzipped
it
a
moment
later
she
presented
them
with
two
identical
packages
wrapped
in
coarse
linen
paper
with
victorian
woodcuts
of
sporting
men
swinging
bats
and
charging
the
line
with
pigskins
under
their
arms
the
kids
echoed
it
these
are
the
best
presents
the
little
girl
confided
in
perry
as
he
picked
delicately
at
the
exquisite
paper
the
paper
gave
way
in
folds
and
curls
and
then
he
and
lester
both
held
their
treasures
aloft
baseball
gloves
perry
said
a
catcher
mitt
and
a
fielder
glove
kettlewell
said
you
look
at
that
catcher
mitt
it
was
black
and
bulbous
the
leather
soft
and
yielding
with
a
patina
of
fine
cracks
like
an
old
painting
it
smelled
like
oil
and
leather
an
old
rich
smell
like
a
gentleman
club
or
an
expensive
briefcase
perry
tried
it
on
and
it
molded
itself
to
his
hand
snug
and
comfortable
it
practically
cried
out
to
have
a
ball
thrown
at
it
and
this
fielder
glove
kettlewell
went
on
pointing
at
the
glove
lester
held
it
was
the
more
traditional
tan
color
comically
large
like
the
glove
of
a
cartoon
character
it
too
had
the
look
of
ancient
leather
the
same
mysterious
smell
of
hide
and
oil
perry
touched
it
with
a
finger
and
it
felt
like
a
woman
cheek
smooth
and
soft
rawlings
the
mickey
mantle
early
the
ultimate
glove
you
got
the
whole
sales
pitch
huh
darling
eva
said
not
unkindly
but
kettlewell
flushed
and
glared
at
her
for
a
moment
perry
broke
in
guys
these
are
wow
incredible
they
better
than
the
modern
product
suzanne
said
that
the
point
you
ca
print
these
or
fab
these
they
wonderful
because
they
so
well
made
so
the
only
way
to
make
a
glove
this
good
would
be
to
fab
it
and
then
give
it
to
several
generations
of
baseball
players
to
love
and
use
for
fifty
to
a
hundred
years
perry
turned
over
the
catcher
mitt
over
a
hundred
years
old
this
was
something
to
go
in
a
glass
case
suzanne
was
right
this
was
a
great
glove
because
people
had
played
with
it
all
the
time
it
needed
to
be
played
with
or
it
would
get
out
of
practice
i
guess
we
going
to
have
to
buy
a
baseball
perry
said
the
little
girl
beside
him
started
bouncing
up
and
down
show
him
suzanne
said
and
the
girl
dove
under
the
table
and
came
up
with
two
white
fresh
hard
balls
once
he
fitted
one
to
the
pocket
of
his
glove
it
felt
so
perfectly
right
like
a
key
in
a
lock
this
pocket
had
held
a
lot
of
balls
over
the
years
lester
had
put
a
ball
in
the
pocket
of
his
glove
too
he
tossed
it
lightly
in
the
air
and
caught
it
then
repeated
the
trick
the
look
of
visceral
satisfaction
on
his
face
was
unmistakable
these
are
presents
guys
perry
said
seriously
well
done
they
all
beamed
and
murmured
and
then
the
ball
lester
was
tossing
crashed
to
the
table
and
broke
a
pitcher
of
blueberry
syrup
upset
a
carafe
of
orange
juice
and
rolled
to
a
stop
in
the
chocolate
mess
in
front
of
the
little
girl
who
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
and
is
why
we
do
play
with
balls
indoors
suzanne
said
looking
as
stern
as
she
could
while
obviously
trying
very
hard
not
to
bust
out
laughing
the
waiters
were
accustomed
to
wiping
up
spills
and
lester
was
awkwardly
helpful
while
they
were
getting
everything
set
to
rights
again
perry
looked
at
eva
and
saw
her
lips
tightly
pursed
as
she
considered
her
husband
he
followed
kettlebelly
gaze
and
saw
that
he
was
watching
suzanne
who
was
laughingly
restraining
lester
from
doing
any
more
cleaning
intently
in
a
flash
perry
thought
he
had
come
to
understanding
oh
dear
he
thought
the
kids
loved
the
shantytown
the
little
girl
ada
like
the
programming
language
eva
said
insisted
on
being
set
down
so
she
could
tread
the
cracked
cement
walkways
herself
head
whipping
back
and
forth
to
take
the
buildings
in
eyes
following
the
zipping
and
bicycles
as
they
wove
in
and
out
of
the
busy
streets
the
shantytowners
were
used
to
tourists
in
their
midst
a
few
yardies
gave
them
the
hairy
eyeball
but
then
they
saw
perry
was
along
and
they
found
something
else
to
pay
attention
to
that
made
perry
feel
obscurely
proud
he
been
absent
for
months
but
even
the
corner
boys
knew
who
he
was
and
did
want
to
screw
with
him
the
guesthouse
landlady
greeted
them
at
the
door
alerted
to
their
coming
by
the
jungle
telegraph
she
shook
perry
hand
warmly
gave
ada
a
lollipop
and
chucked
the
little
boy
pascal
like
the
programming
language
said
eva
with
an
under
the
chin
was
a
lot
simpler
than
at
a
or
a
hilton
just
a
brief
discussion
of
the
available
rooms
and
a
quick
tour
the
kettlewells
opted
for
the
lofty
attic
which
could
fit
two
width
beds
and
a
crib
and
overlooked
the
curving
streets
from
a
high
vantage
suzanne
took
a
more
quotidian
room
just
below
with
lovely
tile
mosaics
made
from
sections
of
plastic
fruit
and
smashed
novelty
soda
bottles
the
landlady
privately
assured
perry
that
her
euphemistic
hourly
trade
was
in
a
different
part
of
the
guesthouse
altogether
with
its
own
staircase
a
few
hours
later
perry
was
alone
again
working
his
ticket
counter
the
kettlewells
were
having
naps
lester
and
suzanne
had
gone
off
to
see
some
sights
and
the
crowd
for
the
ride
was
already
large
snaking
through
the
market
thick
with
vendors
and
hustling
kids
trying
to
pry
the
visitors
loose
of
their
bankrolls
he
felt
like
doing
a
carny
barker
spiel
right
up
step
right
up
this
way
to
the
great
egress
but
the
morning
visitors
seem
all
that
frivolous
they
were
and
sober
everything
ok
he
asked
a
girl
who
was
riding
for
at
least
the
second
time
she
was
a
giantess
in
her
early
twenties
with
big
white
front
teeth
and
broad
shoulders
wearing
a
faded
hoosiers
and
a
lot
of
coral
jewelry
i
mean
you
look
like
you
having
a
fun
time
it
the
story
she
said
i
read
about
it
online
and
i
really
believe
it
but
now
i
totally
see
it
but
you
made
it
right
it
did
just
did
it
no
it
just
happened
perry
said
this
girl
was
a
little
he
put
his
hand
over
his
heart
on
my
honor
it
ca
be
she
said
i
mean
the
story
is
like
someone
must
have
made
it
maybe
they
did
perry
said
maybe
a
bunch
of
people
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
make
a
story
out
of
the
ride
and
came
by
to
do
it
that
probably
it
the
girl
said
the
other
thing
that
just
ridiculous
she
was
gone
and
on
the
ride
before
he
could
ask
her
what
this
meant
and
the
three
bangbangers
behind
her
just
wanted
tickets
not
conversation
an
hour
later
she
was
back
i
mean
the
message
boards
she
said
do
you
follow
your
referers
there
a
guy
in
osceola
who
says
that
this
is
i
know
like
the
story
that
inside
our
collective
unconsciousness
perry
restrained
a
smile
at
the
malapropism
anyway
a
lot
of
people
agree
i
do
think
so
though
no
offense
mister
but
i
think
that
this
is
just
a
prank
or
something
something
perry
said
but
she
rode
twice
more
that
day
and
she
was
the
only
one
it
was
a
day
of
many
repeat
riders
and
the
people
came
by
to
complain
that
the
visitors
buying
much
besides
the
occasional
or
pork
cracklin
perry
shrugged
and
told
them
to
find
something
that
these
people
wanted
to
buy
then
one
or
two
of
the
miniatures
guys
got
gleams
in
their
eyes
and
bought
tickets
for
the
ride
perry
charged
them
half
price
and
perry
knew
that
by
the
time
the
day
was
out
there
be
souvenir
to
be
had
lester
and
suzanne
came
by
after
lunchtime
and
lester
relieved
him
leaving
him
to
escort
suzanne
back
to
the
shantytown
and
the
kettlewells
you
two
seem
to
be
getting
on
well
perry
said
jerking
his
head
back
at
lester
as
they
walked
through
the
market
suzanne
looked
away
this
is
amazing
perry
she
said
waving
her
hand
at
the
market
stalls
a
gesture
that
took
in
the
spires
of
the
shantytown
and
the
ride
too
you
have
done
something
stupendous
you
know
it
i
mean
if
you
had
a
slightly
different
temperament
call
this
a
cult
but
it
seems
like
you
not
in
charge
of
anything
that
for
sure
even
though
you
still
definitely
things
no
way
i
just
go
where
i
told
tjan
leading
i
spoke
to
tjan
before
we
came
out
and
he
points
the
finger
at
you
just
keeping
the
books
and
closing
the
contracts
that
a
direct
quote
well
maybe
no
one
leading
not
everything
needs
a
leader
right
suzanne
shook
her
head
at
him
there
a
leader
sweetie
and
you
have
a
look
around
last
i
checked
there
were
three
more
rides
going
operational
this
week
and
five
more
in
the
next
month
just
looking
at
your
speaking
calendar
gave
me
a
headache
i
have
a
speaking
calendar
you
do
indeed
and
it
a
busy
one
you
knew
that
though
right
tjan
sent
him
email
all
the
time
telling
him
about
this
group
or
that
where
he
was
supposed
to
go
and
give
a
talk
but
he
never
seen
a
calendar
but
who
had
time
to
look
at
the
website
anymore
i
suppose
i
knew
i
was
supposed
to
get
on
a
plane
again
in
a
couple
weeks
so
that
what
a
leader
is
someone
who
gets
people
mobilized
and
moving
i
met
a
girl
in
madison
wisconsin
you
probably
get
along
with
thinking
of
hilda
made
him
smile
and
feel
a
little
horny
a
little
wistful
he
had
gotten
fucked
in
mind
and
body
like
that
since
his
twenties
maybe
i
meet
her
is
she
working
on
a
local
ride
you
going
to
go
to
the
other
rides
i
got
to
write
about
something
perry
otherwise
my
pageviews
fall
off
and
i
ca
pay
my
rent
this
is
a
story
a
big
one
and
no
one
else
has
noticed
it
yet
that
kind
of
story
can
turn
into
the
kind
of
money
you
buy
a
house
with
i
speaking
from
experience
here
you
think
she
put
her
hand
over
her
heart
i
good
at
spotting
these
man
you
got
a
cult
on
your
hands
here
what
the
story
people
i
been
reading
the
message
boards
and
blogs
it
where
i
get
all
my
best
tips
perry
shook
his
head
everyone
else
was
more
on
top
of
this
stuff
than
him
he
was
going
to
have
to
spend
less
time
hacking
the
ride
and
more
time
reading
the
interweb
clearly
it
was
all
lester
idea
anyway
he
said
she
looked
down
with
an
unreadable
expression
he
hazarded
a
guess
as
to
what
that
was
about
things
are
getting
tight
between
you
two
huh
christ
it
does
show
that
much
does
it
no
he
lied
i
just
know
lester
is
all
he
something
else
she
said
suzanne
needed
some
sundries
so
he
directed
her
to
a
little
bodega
in
the
back
room
of
one
of
the
houses
he
told
her
he
meet
her
at
the
guesthouse
and
took
a
seat
in
the
lobby
he
was
still
beat
from
the
cold
and
the
the
work
and
the
sheer
exhaustion
on
the
road
he
had
momentum
dragging
him
from
one
thing
to
the
next
flights
to
catch
speeches
to
make
back
at
home
confronted
with
routine
it
was
like
his
inertia
was
disappearing
eva
kettlewell
thundered
down
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
with
a
sound
like
a
barely
controlled
fall
burst
into
the
lobby
and
headed
for
the
door
her
back
rigid
her
arms
swinging
her
face
a
picture
of
rage
she
went
out
the
door
like
a
flash
and
then
stood
in
the
street
for
a
moment
before
striking
out
seemingly
at
random
perry
thought
sammy
did
dare
go
back
to
the
ride
for
weeks
after
the
debacle
in
boston
he
been
spotted
by
the
chinese
guy
and
the
guy
who
said
he
designed
the
ride
that
much
was
sure
they
probably
suspected
him
of
having
sabotaged
the
boston
ride
but
he
could
stay
away
work
was
dismal
the
other
execs
at
disney
world
were
all
amazingly
petty
and
always
worse
before
the
quarterly
numbers
came
out
management
liked
to
chase
any
kind
of
bad
numbers
with
a
few
ritual
beheadings
the
new
fantasyland
had
been
a
feather
in
sammy
cap
that
had
kept
him
safe
from
politics
for
a
long
time
but
not
anymore
now
it
was
getting
run
down
cigarette
burns
graffiti
and
every
now
and
again
someone
would
find
a
couple
having
pervy
eyeliner
sex
in
the
bushes
he
loved
to
work
openings
in
fantasyland
heyday
he
stand
just
past
the
and
watch
the
flocking
crowds
of
lightly
sweating
goth
kids
pour
through
it
blinking
in
the
unnatural
light
of
the
morning
a
lot
of
them
took
drugs
and
partied
all
night
and
then
capped
it
off
with
an
early
morning
at
fantasyland
disney
had
done
focus
groups
and
they
started
selling
the
chewy
things
that
soothed
the
clenched
jaws
brought
on
by
but
now
he
hated
the
customers
who
sallied
into
his
park
like
they
owned
the
joint
a
girl
maybe
walked
past
on
vinyl
platform
heels
with
two
gigantic
men
in
their
thirties
behind
her
led
on
thin
black
leather
leashes
a
group
of
boys
in
grey
dusters
with
impossibly
high
sprays
of
teased
electric
blue
hair
followed
then
a
group
of
heavily
pierced
older
women
their
faces
rattling
then
it
was
a
river
of
black
kids
in
chains
and
leather
leathery
grownups
who
dressed
like
surly
kids
they
formed
neat
queues
by
their
favorite
rides
the
haunted
houses
the
graveyard
the
coffin
coaster
the
river
of
blood
and
puffed
cloves
through
smokeless
hookahs
at
least
he
hoped
it
was
cloves
the
castmembers
in
sammy
fantasyland
were
no
better
than
the
guests
they
were
pierced
dyed
teased
and
branded
to
within
an
inch
of
their
lives
even
gothier
than
the
goths
who
made
the
long
pilgrimages
to
ride
his
unwholesome
rides
the
worst
of
it
was
that
there
were
of
them
anymore
the
goth
scene
which
had
shown
every
sign
of
surging
and
every
five
years
seemed
finally
to
be
dying
numbers
were
down
a
couple
of
parks
in
the
area
had
shuttered
as
had
the
marshy
one
in
new
orleans
admittedly
that
might
have
been
more
to
do
with
the
cholera
outbreak
last
month
he
shut
down
the
goth
shop
and
put
its
wares
on
deep
online
discount
all
his
little
nieces
and
nephews
were
getting
onesies
skull
and
temporary
and
tattoos
for
christmas
now
he
just
had
to
get
rid
of
the
other
ten
million
bucks
worth
of
merch
morning
death
he
said
the
kid
real
name
was
darren
weinberger
but
he
insisted
on
being
called
death
waits
which
given
his
pudgy
round
cheeks
and
generally
demeanor
was
funny
enough
that
it
had
taken
sammy
a
full
year
to
learn
to
control
his
grin
when
he
said
it
sammy
good
morning
how
you
doing
the
numbers
stink
sammy
said
you
must
have
noticed
death
grin
vanished
i
noticed
time
for
a
new
ride
maybe
no
one
called
them
attractions
anymore
all
that
old
orwellian
disneyspeak
had
been
abolished
they
love
the
coaster
and
the
thrill
rides
are
always
death
waits
had
worked
at
disney
for
three
years
now
since
the
age
of
and
he
had
grown
up
coming
to
the
park
one
of
the
rare
orlando
locals
sammy
had
come
to
rely
on
him
for
what
he
thought
of
as
insight
into
the
goth
street
he
never
said
that
aloud
because
he
knew
how
much
it
sounded
like
whatever
you
crazy
kids
are
into
these
days
but
this
was
helpful
i
that
everyone
likes
thrill
rides
but
how
the
hell
can
you
compete
with
the
gypsy
coasters
they
set
up
their
coasters
by
the
road
and
ran
them
until
there
was
an
injury
serious
enough
to
draw
the
law
a
week
or
two
at
best
you
could
order
the
diy
coaster
kits
from
a
number
of
suppliers
across
the
us
and
mexico
put
them
up
with
cranes
and
labor
and
wishful
thinking
start
taking
tickets
and
when
the
inevitable
catastrophe
ensued
you
could
be
packed
and
on
the
lam
in
a
couple
hours
gypsy
coasters
they
suck
we
got
theming
our
rides
are
that
stuff
is
just
death
waits
was
a
good
kid
but
he
was
a
serious
imbiber
of
the
maybe
try
dance
parties
again
they
tried
a
string
of
raves
but
the
fights
drugs
and
sex
were
just
too
much
for
the
upper
management
no
matter
how
much
money
they
brought
in
sammy
shook
his
head
morosely
i
told
you
that
a
company
this
size
ca
afford
the
risks
from
that
sort
of
thing
a
few
more
goths
straggled
in
they
headed
for
the
which
probably
meant
they
planned
to
get
high
or
make
out
something
he
given
up
on
trying
to
prevent
anything
to
get
the
numbers
up
he
and
the
security
staff
had
come
to
an
understanding
on
this
and
no
one
was
telling
his
boss
or
his
colleagues
i
should
just
bulldoze
the
whole
fucking
thing
and
start
over
what
comes
after
goth
anyway
are
ravers
back
hippies
punks
chavs
death
waits
was
staring
at
him
with
round
eyes
you
would
really
he
waved
at
the
kid
this
was
his
whole
life
no
death
no
not
going
to
bulldoze
this
place
you
got
a
job
for
life
here
it
was
a
lie
of
such
amazing
callousness
that
sammy
felt
a
twinge
of
remorse
while
saying
it
those
twinges
did
come
often
but
death
waits
looked
a
lot
happier
once
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
goths
with
big
cheeks
were
pretty
unconvincing
sammy
stalked
back
to
the
nearest
utilidor
entrance
over
by
what
had
been
the
pinocchio
village
haus
he
turned
the
redesign
over
to
a
designer
who
started
out
as
a
lit
major
and
whose
admiration
for
the
dark
and
twisted
elements
of
the
original
pinocchio
tale
by
carlo
collodi
shone
through
now
it
featured
murals
of
donkeys
being
flensed
by
fish
hectic
pleasure
island
hanged
pinocchio
on
his
gibbet
dangled
over
the
condiment
bar
twitching
and
thrashing
the
smell
of
stale
grease
rose
from
it
like
a
miasma
clashing
with
the
patchouli
they
pumped
out
from
the
underground
misters
down
into
the
tunnels
and
then
into
a
golf
cart
and
out
to
his
office
he
had
time
to
paw
desultorily
at
the
mountain
of
merchandise
samples
that
had
come
in
over
the
week
since
he
last
tackled
it
every
vendor
and
silver
in
the
world
saw
him
as
a
ticket
to
easy
street
none
had
twigged
to
the
fact
that
they
were
their
merch
these
days
still
going
through
merch
had
been
his
task
for
three
years
now
and
it
was
a
hard
habit
to
break
he
liked
the
wounds
with
dancing
maggots
that
were
activated
by
the
skeletal
bikers
with
flocking
algorithms
that
led
them
into
noisy
demolition
derbies
were
a
great
idea
too
since
you
have
to
buy
another
set
after
a
couple
hours
play
his
desk
was
throbbing
pink
which
meant
that
he
was
late
for
something
he
slapped
at
it
read
the
message
that
came
up
remembered
that
there
was
a
weekly
status
meeting
for
that
been
specifically
instructed
to
attend
he
did
go
to
these
things
if
he
could
help
it
the
who
ran
adventureland
and
tomorrowland
and
so
on
were
all
boring
curatorial
types
who
thought
that
change
was
what
you
gave
a
sucker
back
from
a
ten
at
a
wagon
the
met
in
a
sumptuous
that
had
been
themed
in
the
glory
years
of
the
unified
walt
disney
company
it
had
renewable
tropical
hardwood
panelling
a
beautiful
garden
and
a
koi
pond
and
an
aviary
that
teemed
with
chirruping
bright
birds
borrowed
from
the
animal
kingdom
menagerie
the
table
was
a
slab
of
slate
with
a
brushed
finish
over
its
pits
and
shelves
the
chairs
were
so
ergonomic
that
they
had
zero
adjustment
controls
because
they
knew
much
better
than
you
ever
could
how
to
arrange
themselves
for
your
maximum
comfort
he
was
the
last
one
through
the
door
and
they
all
turned
to
stare
at
him
they
all
dressed
for
shit
in
old
fashioned
slacks
and
walking
shoes
company
or
baseball
jerseys
none
of
them
had
a
haircut
that
was
worth
a
damn
not
even
the
two
women
execs
who
main
street
they
dressed
like
the
middle
americans
they
catered
to
or
maybe
a
little
better
sammy
had
always
been
a
sharp
dresser
he
liked
shirts
that
looked
like
good
cotton
but
had
a
little
stretch
built
into
them
so
they
rested
tight
at
his
chest
which
was
big
and
tight
at
his
waist
which
was
small
he
liked
jeans
in
whatever
style
jeans
were
being
worn
in
barcelona
that
year
which
meant
black
jeans
cut
very
square
and
ironed
stiff
without
a
crease
he
had
shades
that
had
been
designed
to
make
his
face
look
a
little
vulpine
a
trait
that
he
always
known
he
had
it
put
people
on
edge
if
you
looked
a
little
wolfy
he
stopped
outside
the
door
of
the
and
squared
up
his
shoulders
he
was
the
youngest
person
on
the
board
and
he
always
been
the
biggest
cockiest
bastard
in
the
room
he
had
to
remember
that
if
he
was
going
to
survive
this
next
hour
he
came
through
the
door
and
stopped
and
looked
at
the
people
around
the
table
and
waited
for
everyone
to
notice
him
they
looked
so
midwestern
and
goofy
and
he
gave
them
his
wolfy
smile
hello
little
piggies
here
to
blow
your
house
down
hey
kids
he
said
and
grabbed
the
coffee
carafe
and
a
mug
off
the
sideboard
he
filled
his
cup
then
passed
the
carafe
off
as
though
every
meeting
began
with
the
of
the
stimulants
he
settled
into
his
seat
and
looked
around
expectantly
glad
you
could
make
it
sammy
that
was
wiener
who
generally
chaired
the
meetings
theoretically
it
was
a
rotating
chairship
but
there
a
certain
kind
of
person
who
naturally
ends
up
running
every
meeting
and
ron
wiener
was
that
kind
of
person
he
tomorrowland
with
three
faceless
nonentities
who
had
been
promoted
above
their
competence
due
to
his
inexplicable
loyalty
to
them
and
between
the
four
of
them
they
managed
to
keep
tomorrowland
the
most
embarrassingly
badly
themed
part
of
the
park
we
were
just
talking
about
you
i
love
being
the
subject
of
conversation
sammy
said
he
slurped
loudly
at
his
coffee
what
we
were
talking
about
was
the
utilization
numbers
from
fantasyland
which
sucked
sammy
knew
they
been
in
for
months
now
and
looking
around
at
those
midwestern
faces
sammy
understood
that
it
was
time
for
the
knives
to
come
out
they
suck
sammy
said
brightly
that
why
we
about
to
change
things
up
that
preempted
them
can
you
explain
that
some
wiener
said
clicking
his
pen
and
squaring
up
his
notepad
these
jerks
and
their
sammy
did
his
best
thinking
on
his
feet
and
on
the
move
confident
wolfy
you
better
than
these
jerks
with
their
pads
and
their
notions
he
sucked
in
a
breath
and
began
to
pace
and
use
his
hands
we
going
to
take
out
every
ride
in
the
land
effective
immediately
lay
off
the
employees
we
going
to
get
a
couple
thrill
rides
and
give
them
a
solid
for
theming
build
our
own
ride
vehicles
queue
areas
and
enclosures
big
ones
weenies
that
will
draw
your
eye
from
outside
the
main
gate
but
that
just
a
stopgap
next
i
going
to
start
the
fatkins
for
this
stuff
all
about
having
fun
most
of
those
used
to
pack
this
place
when
they
were
stuck
in
electric
wheelchairs
but
now
they
too
busy
he
stopped
himself
from
saying
fucking
having
more
adult
fun
to
come
back
but
anyone
who
can
afford
fatkins
has
discretionary
income
and
we
should
have
a
piece
of
it
it
hard
to
say
without
research
but
i
willing
to
bet
that
these
guys
will
respond
strongly
to
nostalgia
i
thinking
of
reinstating
the
old
fantasyland
digging
parts
out
of
storage
whatever
we
have
auctioned
off
on
the
collectibles
market
anyway
and
cloning
the
rest
but
remaking
them
with
a
little
you
know
darkness
like
the
pinocchio
thing
but
more
so
captain
hook
grisly
death
tinker
bell
inherent
porniness
what
kind
of
friendship
did
snow
white
have
with
the
dwarfs
you
see
where
i
going
ironic
we
have
done
ironic
in
a
long
time
it
probably
due
for
a
comeback
they
stared
at
him
in
shocked
silence
you
say
you
going
to
do
this
when
wiener
said
he
want
to
know
so
he
could
get
someone
senior
to
intervene
you
know
research
first
we
shut
down
the
crap
rides
next
week
and
can
the
want
to
commission
the
research
today
if
i
can
start
work
on
the
filler
next
week
too
he
sat
down
they
continued
to
boggle
you
serious
about
this
about
what
getting
rid
of
unprofitable
stuff
researching
profitable
directions
yes
and
yes
there
were
other
routine
agenda
items
which
reminded
sammy
of
why
he
did
come
to
these
meetings
he
spent
the
time
surfing
readymade
coasters
and
checking
the
intranet
for
engineer
availability
he
was
just
getting
into
the
hr
records
to
see
who
he
have
to
lay
off
when
they
finally
wound
down
and
he
sauntered
out
giving
his
wolfy
grin
to
all
with
a
special
flash
of
it
for
wiener
death
i
like
a
word
please
i
be
delighted
death
talked
like
someone
who
learned
to
talk
by
being
a
precocious
reader
he
his
words
spoke
in
complete
sentences
and
paused
at
the
commas
sammy
knew
that
speech
pattern
well
since
he
worked
hard
to
train
himself
out
of
it
it
was
a
geek
accent
and
it
made
you
sound
like
a
instead
of
a
sharp
operator
you
got
that
way
if
you
grew
up
trying
to
talk
with
a
vocabulary
and
a
child
control
of
your
you
learned
to
hold
your
chin
and
cheeks
still
while
you
spoke
to
give
you
a
little
that
was
the
geek
accent
remember
what
we
talked
about
this
morning
building
a
thrill
ride
yes
sammy
said
he
forgotten
that
death
waits
had
suggested
that
in
the
first
place
good
that
was
a
good
spin
i
decided
to
take
your
suggestion
of
course
we
need
to
make
room
for
it
so
going
to
shut
down
some
of
the
crap
you
know
which
ones
i
mean
death
waits
was
green
under
his
white
makeup
you
mean
all
the
the
coffin
coaster
of
course
the
flying
bats
maybe
one
or
two
others
and
i
going
to
need
to
make
some
layoffs
of
course
got
ta
make
room
you
going
to
lay
people
off
how
many
people
we
already
barely
staffed
death
was
the
official
arbiter
of
and
if
you
wanted
to
take
an
afternoon
off
to
get
your
mom
out
of
the
hospital
or
your
dad
out
of
jail
he
was
the
one
to
talk
to
that
why
i
coming
to
you
if
i
shut
down
six
of
the
rides
death
gasped
fantasyland
had
rides
in
total
six
of
the
rides
how
many
of
the
senior
staffers
can
i
get
rid
of
and
still
have
the
warm
bodies
to
keep
everything
running
senior
people
cost
a
more
than
the
teenagers
who
came
through
he
could
hire
six
juniors
for
what
death
cost
him
frigging
florida
labor
laws
meant
that
you
had
to
give
raises
every
year
and
it
added
up
death
looked
like
he
was
going
to
cry
i
got
my
own
estimates
sammy
said
but
i
wanted
to
get
a
reality
check
from
you
since
you
right
there
on
the
ground
hate
to
leave
too
much
fat
on
the
bone
he
knew
what
effect
this
would
have
on
the
kid
death
blinked
back
his
tears
put
his
fist
under
his
chin
and
pulled
out
his
phone
and
started
scribbling
on
it
he
had
a
list
of
every
employee
in
there
and
he
began
to
transfer
names
from
it
to
another
place
they
be
back
right
to
operate
the
new
rides
the
ones
we
do
bring
back
we
get
them
unemployment
counseling
enroll
them
in
a
networking
club
for
the
jobless
one
of
the
really
good
ones
we
can
get
a
group
rate
a
job
reference
from
this
place
goes
a
long
way
too
they
be
death
looked
at
him
a
long
look
the
kid
was
stupid
sammy
knew
none
of
these
people
were
stupid
not
wiener
not
the
kid
not
the
goths
who
led
each
other
around
fantasyland
on
leashes
not
the
fatkins
who
soon
pack
the
place
they
were
none
of
them
stupid
they
were
just
soft
unwilling
to
make
the
hard
choices
sammy
was
good
at
hard
choices
perry
got
home
that
night
and
walked
in
on
lester
and
suzanne
they
were
tangled
on
the
carpet
mostly
naked
and
lester
blushed
right
to
his
when
perry
came
through
the
door
sorry
sorry
lester
called
as
he
grabbed
a
sofa
cushion
and
passed
it
to
suzanne
then
got
one
for
himself
perry
averted
his
eyes
and
tried
not
to
laugh
jesus
guys
what
wrong
with
the
bedroom
we
would
gotten
there
eventually
lester
said
as
he
helped
suzanne
to
her
feet
perry
pointedly
turned
to
face
the
wall
you
were
supposed
to
be
at
dinner
with
the
gang
lester
said
on
the
ride
was
crazy
everything
was
changing
and
the
printers
were
out
of
goop
lots
of
action
on
the
network
boston
and
san
francisco
are
introducing
a
lot
of
new
items
to
the
ride
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
the
kettlewells
were
already
putting
the
kids
to
bed
he
decided
not
to
mention
eva
angry
to
suzanne
no
doubt
she
had
already
figured
out
that
all
was
not
well
in
the
house
of
kettlewell
suzanne
ahem
sorry
sorry
lester
said
let
talk
about
this
later
ok
sorry
they
scurried
off
to
lester
room
and
perry
whipped
out
a
computer
put
on
some
short
humor
videos
in
and
grabbed
a
big
tub
of
spare
parts
he
kept
around
to
fiddle
with
it
could
be
soothing
to
take
apart
and
reassemble
a
complex
mechanism
and
sometimes
you
got
ideas
from
it
five
minutes
later
he
heard
the
shower
running
and
then
suzanne
came
into
the
living
room
i
going
to
order
some
food
what
do
you
feel
like
whatever
you
get
you
have
to
order
it
from
one
of
the
fatkins
places
it
not
practical
to
feed
lester
any
other
way
get
me
a
small
chicken
tikka
pizza
she
pored
over
the
stack
of
menus
in
the
kitchen
does
food
in
twenty
minutes
really
deliver
in
minutes
usually
they
do
most
of
the
prep
in
the
vans
and
use
a
lot
of
predictive
math
in
their
routing
there
usually
a
van
within
about
ten
minutes
of
here
no
matter
what
the
traffic
they
deliver
to
too
on
scooters
suzanne
made
a
face
i
thought
was
weird
she
showed
the
number
on
the
brochure
to
her
phone
and
then
started
to
order
lester
came
out
a
minute
later
dressed
to
the
nines
as
always
he
was
barely
capable
of
entering
his
bedroom
without
effecting
a
wardrobe
change
he
gave
perry
a
slightly
pissed
off
look
and
perry
shrugged
apologetically
though
he
did
feel
all
that
bad
lester
fault
christ
on
a
bike
it
was
weird
to
think
of
the
two
of
them
together
especially
going
at
it
on
the
living
room
rug
like
a
couple
of
horny
teens
suzanne
had
always
been
the
grownup
in
their
little
family
but
that
had
been
back
when
there
was
a
big
company
involved
something
about
being
a
piece
of
a
big
company
made
you
want
to
act
like
always
figured
grownups
should
act
once
you
were
a
free
agent
there
was
any
reason
not
to
embrace
your
urges
when
the
food
came
the
two
of
them
attacked
it
like
hungry
dogs
it
was
clear
that
they
forgotten
their
embarrassment
and
were
planning
another
retreat
to
the
bedroom
once
they
refueled
perry
left
hey
francis
francis
was
sitting
on
the
balcony
of
his
mayoral
house
surveying
the
electric
glow
of
the
shantytown
as
usual
now
he
was
alone
without
any
of
his
old
gang
of
boys
hanging
around
him
he
waved
an
arm
toward
perry
and
beckoned
him
inside
buzzing
him
in
with
his
phone
perry
tracked
up
the
narrow
stairs
wondering
how
francis
negotiated
them
with
his
bad
knee
and
his
propensity
to
have
one
beer
too
many
what
the
good
word
oh
not
much
perry
said
he
helped
himself
to
a
beer
they
made
it
in
the
shantytown
and
fortified
it
with
fruits
like
a
belgian
beer
the
resulting
suds
were
strong
and
sweet
this
one
was
raspberry
and
it
tasted
a
little
pink
like
red
soda
your
friends
are
getting
along
too
good
is
what
i
hear
really
nothing
was
much
of
a
secret
in
this
place
the
little
woman
taken
a
room
of
her
own
down
the
road
my
wife
did
that
to
me
once
crazy
broad
that
their
way
sometimes
get
so
mad
they
just
need
to
walk
away
i
get
that
mad
too
perry
said
oh
hell
me
too
all
the
time
but
men
usually
do
have
the
guts
to
pack
a
suitcase
and
light
out
women
have
the
guts
they
nothing
but
guts
perry
cursed
why
had
kettlebelly
called
him
what
was
going
on
he
called
kettlebelly
hi
perry
hi
landon
what
up
up
yeah
how
are
things
things
well
i
hear
eva
took
off
that
sort
of
thing
anything
we
can
talk
about
kettlewell
did
say
anything
should
i
come
over
no
he
said
i
meet
you
somewhere
where
francis
wordlessly
passed
kettlewell
a
beer
as
he
stepped
out
onto
the
terrace
so
they
in
a
motel
not
far
from
here
the
kids
love
coffins
francis
opened
another
beer
for
himself
hard
to
imagine
a
kid
loved
a
coffin
more
than
your
kids
loved
this
place
this
afternoon
eva
pretty
steamed
at
me
it
just
has
been
very
good
since
i
retired
i
guess
i
pretty
hard
to
live
with
all
the
time
perry
nodded
i
can
see
that
thanks
kettlewell
said
also
he
took
a
pull
off
his
beer
also
i
had
an
affair
both
men
sucked
air
between
their
teeth
with
her
best
friend
perry
coughed
a
little
while
eva
was
pregnant
you
still
breathing
patient
woman
francis
said
she
a
good
woman
kettlewell
said
the
best
mother
of
my
children
but
it
made
her
a
little
so
what
the
plan
kettlewell
you
a
good
man
with
a
plan
perry
said
i
have
to
give
her
a
night
off
to
cool
down
and
then
we
see
never
any
point
in
doing
this
while
she
hot
tomorrow
morning
it
come
together
the
next
morning
perry
found
himself
desperately
embroiled
in
ordering
more
goop
for
the
printers
the
other
rides
had
finally
come
online
in
the
night
after
interminable
network
and
malfing
robots
and
printers
and
scanners
that
cooperate
but
now
there
were
seven
rides
in
the
network
seven
rides
whose
riders
were
rearranging
adding
and
subtracting
and
there
was
reconciling
to
do
the
printers
hummed
and
hummed
the
natives
are
restless
lester
said
pointing
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
at
the
growing
queue
of
riders
we
going
to
be
ready
to
open
soon
perry
had
fallen
into
a
classic
nerd
trap
of
having
almost
solved
a
problem
and
not
realizing
that
the
last
three
percent
of
the
solution
would
take
as
long
as
the
rest
of
it
put
together
meanwhile
the
ride
was
in
a
shambles
as
robots
attempted
to
print
and
arrange
objects
to
mirror
those
around
the
nation
soon
soon
perry
said
he
stood
up
and
looked
around
at
the
shambles
i
lie
this
crap
wo
be
ready
for
hours
yet
sorry
fuck
it
open
up
lester
did
i
know
i
know
but
that
the
deal
with
the
ride
it
got
to
get
in
sync
you
know
we
been
working
on
this
for
months
now
it
just
growing
pains
here
i
give
you
back
your
money
you
come
back
tomorrow
it
all
be
set
to
rights
the
angry
rider
was
a
regular
one
of
the
people
who
came
by
every
morning
to
ride
before
work
she
was
gaunt
and
tall
and
geeky
and
talked
like
an
engineer
with
the
nerd
accent
what
kind
of
printer
lester
broke
in
perry
hid
his
snicker
with
a
cough
lester
would
get
her
talking
about
the
ins
and
outs
of
her
printer
talking
shop
and
before
you
knew
it
she
be
mollified
perry
sold
another
ticket
and
another
hi
again
it
was
the
creepy
guy
the
suit
who
shown
up
in
boston
tjan
had
a
crazy
theory
about
why
he
left
the
boston
launch
in
such
a
hurry
but
who
knew
hi
there
perry
said
long
time
no
see
back
from
boston
huh
for
months
the
guy
was
grinning
and
sweating
and
did
look
good
he
had
a
fresh
bruise
on
his
cheek
with
a
couple
of
knuckle
prints
clearly
visible
ca
wait
to
get
back
on
the
ride
it
been
too
long
sammy
had
been
through
a
rehab
and
knew
how
they
went
you
laid
off
a
bunch
of
people
in
one
fast
hard
big
bang
hired
some
unemployment
coaches
for
the
senior
unionized
employees
scheduled
a
couple
of
networking
events
where
they
could
mingle
with
other
unemployed
slobs
and
pass
around
business
cards
you
needed
a
judas
goat
someone
who
talk
up
the
rehab
to
the
other
employees
whom
you
could
rely
on
death
waits
had
been
his
judas
goat
for
the
fantasyland
goth
makeover
he
tirelessly
evangelized
the
idea
to
his
had
found
goth
who
blog
the
hell
out
of
every
inch
of
the
rehab
had
run
every
errand
no
matter
how
menial
but
his
passion
did
carry
over
to
dismantling
the
goth
rehab
sammy
should
have
anticipated
that
but
he
had
totally
failed
to
do
so
he
was
just
so
used
to
thinking
of
death
waits
as
someone
who
was
a
slave
to
the
park
come
on
cheer
up
look
at
how
cool
these
thrill
rides
are
going
to
be
those
were
your
idea
you
know
check
out
the
and
the
little
at
the
end
that
photoshops
all
the
riders
into
zombies
that
got
to
be
right
up
your
alley
right
your
friends
are
going
to
love
this
death
moped
as
only
a
goth
could
he
performed
his
duties
slowly
and
unenthusiastically
when
sammy
pinned
him
down
with
a
direct
question
he
let
his
bangs
fall
over
his
eyes
looked
down
at
his
feet
and
went
silent
come
on
what
the
hell
is
going
on
the
fences
were
supposed
to
be
up
this
morning
the
plan
had
been
to
get
the
maintenance
crews
in
before
to
fence
off
the
doomed
rides
so
that
the
dismantling
could
begin
but
when
he
shown
up
at
eight
there
was
no
sign
of
the
fences
no
sign
of
the
maintenance
crews
and
the
rides
were
all
fully
staffed
death
looked
at
his
feet
sammy
bubbled
with
rage
if
you
trust
your
own
people
you
were
lost
there
were
already
enough
people
around
the
park
looking
for
a
way
to
him
death
i
talking
to
you
for
christ
sake
do
be
such
a
goddamned
baby
you
shut
down
the
goddamned
rides
and
send
those
home
i
want
a
wrecking
crew
here
by
lunchtime
death
waits
looked
at
his
feet
some
more
his
floppy
black
wings
of
hair
covered
his
face
but
from
the
snuffling
noises
sammy
knew
there
was
some
crying
going
on
underneath
all
that
hair
suck
it
up
he
said
or
go
home
sammy
turned
on
his
heel
and
started
for
the
door
and
that
was
when
death
waits
leapt
on
his
back
dragged
him
to
the
ground
and
started
punching
him
he
was
much
of
a
puncher
but
he
did
have
a
lot
of
chunky
silver
that
really
stung
he
pasted
a
couple
good
ones
on
sammy
before
sammy
came
to
his
senses
and
threw
the
skinny
kid
off
of
him
strangely
sammy
anger
was
dissipated
by
the
actual
physical
violence
he
had
never
thrown
a
punch
in
his
life
and
he
was
willing
to
bet
the
same
was
true
of
death
waits
there
was
something
almost
funny
about
an
actual
death
waits
picked
himself
up
and
looked
at
sammy
the
kid
eyeliner
was
in
smears
down
his
cheeks
and
his
hair
was
standing
up
on
end
sammy
shook
his
head
slowly
do
bother
cleaning
out
your
locker
i
have
your
things
sent
to
you
and
do
stop
on
your
way
out
of
the
park
either
he
could
have
called
security
but
that
would
have
meant
sitting
there
with
death
waits
until
they
arrived
the
kid
would
go
and
he
would
never
come
back
he
was
disgraced
and
leave
he
did
sammy
had
death
wait
employee
pass
deactivated
and
the
contents
of
his
locker
black
and
blunt
eyeliner
pencils
sent
by
mail
to
his
house
he
cut
off
death
waits
benefits
he
had
the
deadwood
rides
shuttered
and
commenced
their
destruction
handing
over
any
piece
recognizable
as
coming
from
a
ride
to
the
company
auction
department
to
list
online
anything
to
add
black
to
his
bottom
line
but
his
cheek
throbbed
where
death
had
laid
into
him
and
he
lost
his
fire
for
the
new
project
were
fatkins
a
market
segment
he
should
have
commissioned
research
on
it
but
he
needed
to
get
a
plan
in
the
can
in
time
to
mollify
the
executive
committee
plus
he
knew
what
his
eyes
told
him
every
day
the
park
was
full
of
fatkins
and
always
had
been
the
ghost
of
death
waits
was
everywhere
sammy
had
to
figure
out
for
himself
whom
to
fire
and
how
to
do
it
he
did
really
know
any
of
the
goth
kids
that
worked
the
rides
these
days
death
waits
had
hired
and
led
them
there
were
lots
of
crying
fits
and
threats
and
the
kids
he
did
fire
acted
like
they
were
next
and
if
it
had
been
for
the
need
to
keep
revenue
flowing
sammy
would
have
canned
all
of
them
then
he
caught
wind
of
what
they
were
all
doing
with
their
severance
pay
traveling
south
to
hollywood
and
riding
that
goddamned
frankenride
in
the
dead
trying
to
turn
it
into
goth
paradise
judging
from
the
he
surfed
the
whole
thing
had
been
death
waits
idea
goddamn
it
it
was
boston
all
over
again
he
pulled
the
plug
and
the
machine
kept
on
moving
the
hoardings
went
up
and
the
rides
came
down
but
all
his
former
employees
and
their
weird
eyeliner
pervert
pals
all
went
somewhere
else
and
partied
on
just
the
same
his
attendance
numbers
were
way
down
and
the
photobloggers
posting
shots
of
black
clouds
of
goths
at
the
frankenride
made
it
clear
where
they
all
gone
he
thought
let
go
have
a
look
the
guy
with
the
funny
eyebrow
made
him
immediately
but
did
seem
to
be
suspicious
maybe
they
never
figured
out
what
he
done
in
boston
the
goth
kids
were
busy
in
the
market
stalls
or
hanging
around
smoking
clove
and
patchouli
hookahs
and
they
ignored
him
as
a
square
and
beneath
their
notice
the
ride
had
changed
a
great
deal
since
his
last
fated
visit
heard
about
the
story
of
course
the
press
had
reported
on
it
in
an
editorial
that
week
but
now
the
story
which
as
he
could
perceive
it
was
an
orderly
progression
of
what
seemed
to
be
someone
life
unfolding
from
childhood
naivete
to
adolescent
exuberance
to
adult
cynicism
to
a
nostalgic
elderly
delight
was
augmented
by
familiar
accoutrements
there
was
a
robot
from
one
of
the
rides
he
torn
down
yesterday
and
here
was
half
the
sign
from
the
coffin
coaster
a
bush
from
the
the
little
bastards
had
stolen
the
deconstructed
and
brought
it
here
by
the
time
he
got
off
the
ride
he
was
grinning
ferociously
by
tomorrow
there
be
copies
of
all
that
trademarked
rolling
off
the
printers
in
ten
cities
around
the
united
states
that
was
a
major
bit
of
illegal
activity
and
he
knew
where
he
could
find
some
hungry
who
love
to
argue
about
it
he
jumped
on
the
ride
again
and
got
his
camera
configured
for
shooting
eva
showed
up
on
perry
doorstep
that
night
after
dinner
lester
and
suzanne
had
gone
off
to
the
beach
and
perry
was
alone
updating
his
inventory
of
tchotchkes
with
a
camera
and
an
old
computer
getting
everything
stickered
with
rfids
she
had
the
kids
in
tow
ada
spotted
the
two
old
lovely
baseball
mitts
on
the
crowded
coffee
table
and
made
a
for
them
putting
one
over
each
hand
and
walking
around
smacking
them
together
to
hear
the
leathery
sound
snooping
in
drawers
and
peering
at
the
of
an
that
perry
hastily
snapped
up
and
put
on
a
high
shelf
which
winked
once
to
let
him
know
that
it
had
tracked
the
movement
and
noted
the
location
of
the
tool
the
little
boy
pascal
rode
on
his
mother
hip
eva
had
clearly
had
a
bit
of
a
cry
but
had
gotten
over
it
now
she
was
determined
with
her
jaw
thrust
out
and
her
chin
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
him
he
been
driving
me
crazy
since
he
retired
you
know
he
had
an
affair
he
told
me
she
laughed
he
tells
he
boasting
you
know
whatever
i
know
why
he
did
it
crisis
but
before
that
it
was
crisis
and
adolescent
crisis
that
guy
know
what
to
do
with
himself
he
a
good
man
but
he
out
of
his
fucking
mind
if
he
not
juggling
a
hundred
balls
perry
tried
out
a
noncommittal
shrug
you
his
buddy
i
know
but
you
have
to
see
that
it
true
right
i
love
him
i
really
do
but
he
got
a
streak
a
mile
wide
it
does
matter
how
much
he
loves
me
or
the
kids
if
he
not
torturing
himself
with
work
he
got
to
come
up
with
something
else
to
screw
up
his
life
i
thought
that
we
were
going
to
spend
the
next
twenty
years
raising
the
kids
doing
volunteer
work
and
traveling
not
much
chance
of
that
though
you
saw
how
he
was
looking
at
suzanne
you
think
he
and
suzanne
no
i
asked
him
and
he
said
no
then
i
talked
to
and
she
told
me
that
she
would
ever
let
something
like
that
happen
her
i
believe
she
sat
down
and
dandled
the
little
boy
until
he
gurgled
contentedly
perry
heard
ada
going
crazy
in
the
kitchen
with
a
mechanical
sphincter
he
been
building
rides
are
a
lot
of
fun
perry
your
ride
it
amazing
but
i
do
want
to
ride
a
ride
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
landon
is
a
ride
that
does
stop
you
get
off
perry
was
at
a
loss
i
never
had
a
relationship
that
lasted
more
than
six
months
eva
i
got
no
business
giving
you
advice
on
this
stuff
kettlewell
is
pretty
amazing
though
it
sounds
like
you
got
him
pretty
wired
right
you
know
that
if
he
busy
he
happy
and
when
he
slack
he
miserable
sounds
like
if
you
keep
him
busy
he
be
the
kind
of
guy
you
want
him
to
be
even
if
you
wo
have
much
time
to
play
with
him
she
unholstered
a
tit
and
stuck
it
in
the
boy
mouth
and
perry
looked
at
the
carpet
she
laughed
you
are
such
a
geek
she
said
ok
fine
i
hear
what
you
saying
so
how
do
i
get
him
busy
again
can
you
use
him
around
here
here
perry
thought
about
it
i
do
think
we
need
much
empire
building
around
here
i
thought
you
say
that
perry
what
the
hell
am
i
going
to
do
there
was
a
tremendous
crash
from
the
kitchen
a
shriek
of
surprise
then
a
small
oops
ada
eva
called
what
now
i
was
playing
ball
in
the
house
ada
said
in
the
same
small
voice
even
though
you
have
told
me
not
to
and
i
broke
something
i
should
have
listened
to
you
eva
shook
her
head
plays
me
like
a
goddamned
cello
she
said
sorry
perry
we
pay
for
whatever
it
was
he
patted
her
arm
you
forget
who
you
talking
to
i
love

sweat

whatever
i
buy
you

it
for
parts
ada
what
did
you

made
of
seashells
by
the
toaster
it
twitching
seashell
robot
perry
said
no
sweat
it
was
due
for
an
overhaul
anyway
christ
she
said
robot
kettlewell
is
why
we
gave
up
making
that
kind
of
thing
he
said
have
you
seen
him
i
seen
him
how
penitent
was
he
he
thought
back
to
kettlewell
long
puss
on
francis
terrace
yeah
pretty
penitent
he
pretty
worried
i
say
she
nodded
all
right
then
maybe
he
learned
a
lesson
ada
stop
breaking
things
and
get
your
shoes
back
on
we
going
back
to
daddy
yes
she
said
good
ada
said
they
were
barely
out
the
door
when
suzanne
and
lester
came
in
they
nodded
at
perry
and
disappeared
into
the
bedroom
ten
minutes
later
suzanne
stomped
out
again
she
barely
looked
at
perry
as
she
disappeared
into
the
corridor
slamming
the
door
behind
her
perry
waited
five
minutes
to
see
if
lester
would
come
out
on
his
own
this
happened
sometimes
with
the
fatkins
girls
love
among
the
fatkins
was
stormy
and
unpredictable
and
lester
seemed
to
like
bragging
about
the
they
experienced
each
one
an
oddity
of
sybaritic
fatkins
culture
to
boast
about
but
lester
did
come
out
this
time
perry
thought
about
calling
him
or
sending
him
an
email
finally
perry
went
and
knocked
at
his
door
oh
go
back
to
the
living
room
i
come
out
i
come
out
perry
went
back
and
moused
desultorily
at
some
blogs
for
a
while
listening
for
lester
door
opening
finally
out
he
came
and
perry
shook
his
head
was
everyone
miserable
tonight
hello
lester
he
said
something
on
your
mind
he
barked
a
humorless
laugh
with
her
i
still
fat
perry
nodded
as
though
he
understood
though
he
did
since
fatkins
i
felt
like
i
do
know
a
real
person
when
i
was
big
i
was
invisible
and
totally
asexual
i
did
think
about
having
sex
with
anyone
and
no
one
ever
thought
about
having
sex
with
me
when
i
felt
something
for
a
woman
it
was
more
like
a
big
romantic
love
like
i
was
a
beast
and
she
was
a
beauty
and
we
could
enjoy
some
kind
of
chaste
spiritual
love
fatkins
made
me
whole
a
whole
person
with
a
life
below
my
belt
as
well
as
above
my
neck
i
know
it
looks
gross
and
desperate
to
you
but
to
me
it
a
celebration
every
time
i
get
together
with
a
fatkins
girl
and
we
you
know
partying
for
both
of
us
it
becomes
something
really
intimate
a
denial
of
pain
a
fuck
you
to
the
universe
that
made
us
so
gross
and
untouchable
and
with
her
you
still
fat
huh
lester
winced
yeah
it
my
problem
i
guess
i
really
resent
her
for
not
wanting
me
when
i
was
big
though
i
totally
get
why
she
have
maybe
you
angry
that
she
wants
you
now
huh
lester
looked
at
his
hands
which
he
was
in
his
lap
ok
maybe
why
should
she
want
me
now
i
the
same
person
after
all
except
that
you
whole
now
urk
lester
started
pacing
who
broke
the
kettlewell
daughter
ada
eva
was
over
with
the
kids
she
moved
out
on
kettlebelly
he
thought
about
whether
he
should
tell
lester
what
the
hell
she
thinks
he
in
love
with
suzanne
jesus
lester
said
maybe
we
should
swap
i
take
eva
and
he
can
take
suzanne
you
such
a
pig
perry
said
you
know
us
fatkins
fuck
food
and
folly
so
what
going
on
with
you
and
suzanne
now
she
gone
away
until
i
can
get
naked
around
her
without
either
bursting
into
tears
or
making
sarcastic
remarks
jesus
crying
perry
could
remember
when
he
ever
seen
lester
cry
it
was
waterworks
city
these
days
around
here
ah
perry
just
wanted
this
day
to
be
over
he
missed
hilda
though
he
barely
knew
her
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
someone
here
at
home
with
him
someone
he
could
cuddle
up
to
in
bed
and
talk
this
all
out
with
maybe
he
should
call
tjan
he
hit
the
button
on
his
computer
that
made
the
tv
blink
the
time
in
morse
code
it
was
he
have
to
be
up
in
six
hours
to
get
the
ride
up
and
running
screw
all
this
he
was
going
to
bed
he
had
even
gotten
a
single
email
from
hilda
since
he
left
madison
not
that
he
sent
one
to
her
of
course
lester
was
still
snoring
when
perry
slipped
out
of
the
condo
a
bulb
of
juice
and
a
microwavable
venison
and
breakfast
burrito
under
his
arm
he
had
a
little
microwave
and
by
the
time
he
hit
his
first
red
light
the
burrito
was
and
ready
to
eat
he
gobbled
it
while
he
made
his
way
to
the
ride
there
were
two
cop
cars
at
the
end
of
the
driveway
leading
to
the
parking
lot
broward
county
sheriff
deputy
parked
horizontally
to
blockade
the
drive
perry
pulled
over
and
got
out
of
his
car
slowly
keeping
his
hands
in
plain
sight
the
doors
of
the
cruisers
opened
too
the
deputies
already
had
their
mirrorshades
on
though
the
sun
was
still
rising
and
they
set
down
their
coffees
on
the
hood
of
the
cars
this
yours
a
deputy
said
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
at
the
flea
market
and
the
ride
perry
knew
better
than
to
answer
any
questions
can
i
help
you
we
shutting
you
down
buddy
sorry
the
cop
was
young
latina
and
female
her
partner
was
older
white
and
male
with
the
ruddy
complexion
that
perry
associated
with
old
time
florida
cops
what
the
charge
there
no
charge
the
male
cop
said
he
sounded
like
he
was
angry
already
and
anything
perry
said
would
just
make
him
angrier
we
charge
you
if
we
going
to
arrest
you
we
enforcing
an
injunction
now
if
you
try
to
get
past
us
we
come
up
with
a
charge
and
we
arrest
you
can
i
see
the
injunction
sure
you
can
go
to
the
courthouse
and
see
the
injunction
are
you
supposed
to
have
a
copy
of
it
to
show
to
me
am
i
the
cop
grin
was
mean
and
impatient
can
i
go
and
get
some
stuff
from
my
office
if
you
want
to
get
arrested
you
can
he
pulled
a
dyspeptic
face
and
drank
some
coffee
then
got
back
into
his
cruiser
the
other
cop
had
the
grace
to
look
faintly
embarrassed
at
her
asshole
partner
but
then
she
too
got
back
in
her
car
perry
thought
furiously
about
this
the
cop
was
clearly
itching
to
bust
his
ass
maybe
he
hated
the
ride
or
this
duty
or
maybe
he
hated
perry
maybe
he
was
one
of
the
cops
who
had
raided
the
shantytown
all
those
years
before
perry
had
taken
a
pretty
big
settlement
off
the
county
over
the
shot
in
his
head
and
it
was
a
sure
bet
that
a
lot
of
cops
had
suffered
for
it
and
now
harbored
some
enmity
for
him
as
bad
as
this
was
it
was
about
to
get
worse
the
goth
kids
been
hanging
around
in
droves
lately
they
did
seem
like
the
sort
with
a
lot
of
good
instincts
when
it
came
to
dealing
with
authority
figures
then
there
were
the
stall
owners
who
be
coming
over
the
road
to
open
their
shops
in
an
hour
or
so
this
could
get
really
goddamned
ugly
he
needed
a
lawyer
and
someone
to
front
for
him
with
the
lawyer
he
could
call
tjan
he
would
call
him
in
fact
but
not
just
yet
there
were
limits
to
what
tjan
could
do
from
boston
after
all
he
got
back
in
his
car
and
peeled
across
the
road
to
the
shantytown
and
the
guesthouse
kettlewell
he
thumped
the
door
come
on
landon
it
me
perry
it
an
emergency
he
heard
eva
curse
then
heard
movement
whazzit
sorry
man
i
would
have
woken
you
but
it
a
real
emergency
fire
no
cops
they
shut
down
the
ride
kettlewell
opened
the
door
a
crack
and
stared
at
him
with
a
eye
cops
shut
down
the
ride
yeah
they
say
there
an
injunction
gim
me
a
sec
got
ta
put
some
pants
on
he
closed
the
door
as
perry
listened
to
the
sounds
of
him
getting
dressed
he
reflected
that
done
eva
the
favor
she
been
seeking
he
found
something
to
keep
kettlewell
busy
kettlewell
quizzed
him
intensely
as
they
drove
back
across
the
road
to
the
he
called
tjan
and
got
voicemail
left
a
brief
message
then
got
out
of
the
car
and
stood
still
outside
it
waving
at
the
what
the
male
cop
looked
even
more
dyspeptic
hi
there
i
wondered
if
i
could
get
you
to
explain
what
going
on
here
so
we
can
open
up
shop
again
we
shut
you
down
to
enforce
an
injunction
what
injunction
is
that
a
court
injunction
which
court
the
cop
looked
really
angry
for
a
second
then
he
got
back
in
his
car
and
fished
around
broward
county
he
sounded
aggrieved
is
that
the
injunction
there
kettlewell
said
no
the
cop
said
too
quickly
they
both
knew
he
was
lying
jerking
them
around
can
i
see
it
does
it
have
information
about
who
to
talk
to
to
get
the
injunction
lifted
kettlewell
tone
was
even
pleasant
and
very
adult
the
voice
of
someone
used
to
being
obeyed
you
have
to
go
to
the
courthouse
they
open
in
a
couple
hours
i
really
like
to
see
it
oh
for
chrissakes
the
female
cop
said
just
show
it
to
them
tom
god
she
spat
on
the
ground
her
partner
gave
her
a
look
then
handed
the
paper
over
to
kettlewell
who
pored
over
it
intently
perry
shoulder
surfed
him
and
gathered
that
they
were
being
shut
down
for
infringing
disney
parks
company
trademarks
that
was
weird
you
could
hardly
go
ten
feet
in
florida
without
tripping
over
a
bootleg
mickey
so
why
should
the
mickey
designs
trigger
legal
action
all
right
then
kettlewell
said
let
make
some
phone
calls
they
got
in
the
car
and
drove
across
the
road
to
the
shantytown
there
was
a
that
opened
early
and
they
commandeered
its
window
table
and
spread
out
their
things
perry
called
lester
and
woke
him
up
it
took
two
or
three
tries
to
get
his
head
around
it
lester
could
figure
out
why
they
shut
down
the
but
once
he
got
that
the
ride
was
down
too
he
woke
up
fast
and
promised
to
meet
them
kettlewell
conversation
with
tjan
was
a
lot
more
heated
perry
tried
to
eavesdrop
but
could
make
any
sense
of
it
all
the
rides
are
down
he
said
once
he
dropped
the
phone
to
bounce
a
couple
times
on
the
tabletop
making
the
coffees
shiver
every
one
of
them
was
shut
down
by
the
cops
this
morning
you
shitting
me
but
they
do
all
sell
the
same
stuff
they
were
shut
down
because
of
disney
trademarks
in
the
ride
itself
or
so
it
seems
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
tjan
hired
a
lawyer
for
the
boston
group
and
we
can
hire
one
for
here
but
i
do
think
we
going
to
be
able
to
hire
fixers
everywhere
that
there
a
ride
that
going
to
be
really
expensive
disney
filed
all
the
injunctions
at
the
state
level
they
have
an
industry
association
they
work
through
that
has
cooperating
attorneys
in
every
city
in
the
country
so
it
was
easy
for
them
holy
crap
yeah
who
did
you
piss
off
perry
damned
if
he
knew
he
literally
could
think
of
a
single
person
who
want
to
do
this
someone
had
convinced
the
disney
company
to
clobber
him
like
godzilla
going
after
tokyo
it
just
did
make
any
sense
so
what
do
we
do
kettlewell
looked
at
him
i
have
no
clue
perry
you
are
a
company
you
are
a
network
of
companies
you
are
an
industry
association
no
one
can
speak
for
you
you
ca
lobby
or
even
field
a
spokesman
i
mean
none
of
that
stuff
works
for
you
and
that
the
only
way
i
know
to
fight
back
in
court
i
thought
we
were
immune
to
this
stuff
if
there
no
one
to
sue
how
can
they
sue
us
if
there
no
one
to
sue
there
no
one
to
show
up
in
court
and
object
either
yeah
i
do
think
we
can
incorporate
you
in
time
to
make
a
difference
kettlewell
said
so
we
need
to
think
of
something
else
suzanne
slid
into
the
booth
beside
them
her
hair
was
tied
back
and
her
makeup
was
spare
and
severe
she
had
on
trousers
high
like
a
and
a
loose
flowing
white
cotton
on
top
of
a
luminescent
pink
tank
perry
could
tell
whether
it
was
formal
or
informal
but
it
looked
good
and
a
little
intimidatingly
foreign
she
did
meet
perry
eye
brief
me
she
said
she
held
out
her
phone
and
put
it
in
record
mode
kettlewell
ran
it
down
quickly
and
she
nodded
jotting
notes
so
what
happens
next
not
much
we
can
do
kettlewell
said
the
riders
will
be
along
shortly
oh
and
the
merchants
perry
still
could
catch
her
eye
i
go
take
some
pictures
she
said
be
careful
perry
said
she
mugged
for
him
sweetie
i
take
pictures
of
the
mafiyeh
then
it
was
all
right
between
them
again
somehow
right
kettlewell
said
how
our
time
looking
got
thirty
minutes
until
the
first
of
the
merchants
show
up
an
hour
until
the
riders
start
turning
up
you
do
have
a
lawyer
do
you
perry
quirked
his
funny
eyebrow
stupid
question
ok
right
i
make
some
more
calls
let
get
some
people
out
of
bed
what
can
i
do
kettlewell
looked
at
him
huh
um
this
is
really
my
beat
now
i
suppose
you
could
go
keep
suzanne
company
gee
thanks

wrong
with
suzanne

wrong
with
suzanne
he
said
ok
off
i
go
he
set
off
on
foot
the
shantytown
had
woken
up
now
people
getting
ready
for
the
hike
to
the
early
busses
into
places
where
the
few
remaining
jobs
were
he
took
his
phone
out
and
tossed
it
from
hand
to
hand
then
he
called
the
number
that
he
programmed
in
all
those
days
ago
in
madison
but
had
never
bothered
to
call
he
forgot
until
the
ringing
started
that
it
was
another
there
an
hour
or
two
earlier
but
when
hilda
answered
she
sounded
wide
awake
nice
of
you
to
call
she
said
nice
of
you
to
answer
her
voice
sent
a
thrill
up
his
spine
we
got
cops
outside
of
the
ride
here
she
said
we
only
been
live
for
a
week
too
they
at
every
ride
he
said
they
shut
us
down
too

to
do
about
it

am
going
to
do

we
woke
up
and
discovered
the
cops

waiting
for

he
groaned
and
sat
down
on
a
curb
oh

she
sighed
heavily
at
the
other
end
ok

pull
it

need
to
set
up
a
conference
call
with
every
ride
operator
so
we
can
talk
this
over

online
and
post
a
time
and
an
address
i
chat

up
and
make
some
calls

some
calls
too
everyone
likes
to
hear
from
you
they
like
to
know
you

their
side
right
he
said
getting
back
to
his
feet
turning
around
to
get
his
computer
out
of
his
trunk
right
that
totally
the
right
thing
to
do
i
on
it
good
man
she
said
a
little
pause
stretched
between
them
so
he
said
how
you
doing
apart
from
all
this
her
laugh
was
merry
i
thought
you
never
ask
i
looking
forward
to
your
next
visit
is
how
i
doing
really
of
course
really
you
sounded
a
little
pissed
at
me
there
is
all
he
sounded
like
a
lovesick
teenager
i
mean
he
broke
off
your
ass
needed
kicking
was
all
pause
i
not
pissed
at
you
though
when
are
you
coming
for
a
visit
got
me
he
said
i
guess
i
should
right
he
really
sounded
like
a
teenager
you
need
to
visit
all
the
sites
check
in
on
how
we
doing
pause
plus
you
should
come
hang
out
with
me
some
he
almost
pointed
out
all
her
warnings
about
only
having
a
stand
and
not
missing
the
people
he
was
away
from
and
so
forth
but
stayed
his
tongue
the
fact
that
she
wanted
him
to
come
for
a
visit
was
overshadowing
everything
even
the
looming
crisis
with
the
cops
it
a
deal
deal
well
bye
bye
he
almost
said
you
hang
up
first
but
that
would
have
been
too
much
instead
he
just
kept
the
phone
at
his
ear
until
he
heard
her
click
suzanne
was
pointing
and
shooting
like
mad
perry
sat
down
on
the
cracked
pavement
beside
her
and
unfolded
his
computer
and
started
sending
out
emails
setting
up
a
he
gave
suzanne
a
short
version
of
his
talk
with
hilda
being
careful
not
to
give
a
hint
of
his
feelings
for
her
she
sounds
like
a
sensible
girl
suzanne
said
you
should
go
and
pay
her
another
visit
he
blushed
and
she
socked
him
in
the
shoulder
take
your
call
she
said
the
cops
were
giving
them
the
hairy
eyeball
and
perry
screwed
in
his
headset
the
conference
channel
was
filling
up
perry
checked
off
names
as
reps
from
all
the
rides
came
online
there
was
a
lot
of
tight
tense
chatter
jokes
about
the
fuzz
ok
perry
said
let
get
it
started
there
cops
blockading
every
ride
right
use
the
poll
please
he
posted
a
poll
to
the
conference
page
and
it
quickly
got
to
percent
green
so
i
just
found
the
cops
outside
of
mine
too
and
i
not
sure
what
to
do
about
it
got
some
dough
for
a
lawyer
but
i
ca
afford
lawyers
for
everyone
to
make
that
work
we
have
to
fly
attorneys
to
every
city
with
a
ride
in
it
and
that
not
practical
as
i
sure
you
can
tell
a
flags
went
up
in
the
conference
page
i
need
someone
to
play
moderator
i
ca
talk
and
mod
at
the
same
time
how
about
you
hilda
ok
she
said
i
hilda
hammersen
from
the
madison
group
post
summaries
of
your
points
and
i
set
a
speaker
order
the
conference
page
filled
up
there
was
the
official
back
channel
at
the
bottom
where
the
text
was
spilling
by
too
fast
for
perry
to
parse
and
he
knew
that
there
were
lots
of
unofficial
in
use
too
he
covered
the
mic
and
sighed
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
these
people
he
did
have
any
answers
right
so
who
knows
what
we
should
do
the
went
crazy
hilda
started
speakers
with
their
flags
up
why
are
you
asking
us
perry
you
got
to
run
this
the
voice
was
petulant
and
perry
saw
that
it
was
one
of
the
boston
crew
which
made
him
wonder
what
tjan
was
going
to
do
when
he
discovered
that
perry
was
doing
this
the
page
pinkened
and
then
sank
into
red
the
other
people
on
the
call
clearly
thought
this
was
bs
which
was
a
relief
to
perry
hilda
cued
up
the
next
speaker
we
could
set
up
information
pickets
at
the
gates
to
each
ride
hitting
people
up
for
donations
for
our
legal
defense
get
the
press
to
cover
it
and
maybe
we
could
bring
in
enough
to
fight
all
the
injunctions
the
pink
lightened
a
little
went
back
to
neutral
white
turned
a
little
green
perry
slowed
down
the
a
little
and
skimmed
it
no
way
could
we
bring
in
enough
that
like
grand
each
i
get
a
couple
hundred
people
here
in
the
morning
and
that
would
mean
a
hundred
and
fifty
bucks
each
no
no
it
totally
we
can
raise
that
easy
just
set
up
some
paypals
and
publicize
the
shit
out
of
it
the
next
speaker
was
talking
what
if
we
got
the
maintenance
bots
to
break
open
the
doors
and
carry
the
ride
outside
where
everyone
can
see
it
bright
red
dumb
idea
perry
broke
in
i
worried
that
when
people
show
up
it
provoke
some
kind
of
confrontation
with
the
law
it
could
get
ugly
here
how
can
we
keep
that
cooled
out
green
that
totally
got
to
be
our
top
priority
hilda
said
next
speaker
ok
so
the
best
way
to
keep
people
calm
is
to
tell
them
that
there
an
alternative
to
going
nuts
which
maybe
could
be
raising
money
for
a
legal
defense
what
about
finding
lawyers
what
about
the
aclu
or
eff
greener
the
filled
up
with
urls
and
phone
numbers
and
email
addresses
ok
time
running
out
here
perry
said
you
guys
need
to
organize
a
to
those
orgs
and
see
if
they
help
us
out
pass
the
hat
at
your
rides
try
to
find
lawyers
everyone
keep
reporting
in
all
day
especially
if
you
get
a
win
anywhere
i
going
to
go
take
care
of
things
here
hilda
imed
him
good
luck
perry
you
kick
ass
perry
started
to
im
back
but
a
shadow
fell
across
his
screen
it
was
jason
who
ran
the
stall
he
was
staring
at
the
two
quizzically
looking
groggy
but
growing
alarmed
perry
closed
his
lid
and
got
to
his
feet
morning
jason
behind
jason
were
five
or
six
other
vendors
the
sellers
who
lived
in
the
shantytown
and
could
therefore
walk
to
work
were
always
first
in
soon
the
commuters
would
start
arriving
in
their
beater
cars
hey
perry
jason
said
he
was
chewing
on
an
unlit
cigarette
a
disgusting
habit
that
was
only
marginally
less
gross
than
smoking
them
he
tried
toothpicks
but
nothing
would
satisfy
his
oral
cravings
like
a
at
least
he
did
light
them
up
perry
told
him
what
he
knew
which
was
much
jason
listened
carefully
as
did
the
other
vendors
who
arrived
they
fucking
with
you
man
the
cops
disney
all
of
them
just
fucking
with
you
you
go
ahead
and
hire
a
lawyer
to
go
to
the
court
for
you
and
see
how
far
it
gets
you
they
not
playing
by
any
rules
they
not
interested
in
the
law
you
broke
or
whatever
they
just
want
to
fuck
with
you
suzanne
appeared
over
perry
shoulder
i
suzanne
church
jason
i
a
reporter
sure
i
know
you
you
were
there
when
they
burned
down
the
old
place
that
was
me
i
think
you
right
they
fucking
with
you
guys
i
want
to
report
on
that
because
it
might
be
that
exposing
it
makes
it
harder
to
continue
can
i
record
what
you
guys
say
and
do
jason
grinned
and
slid
the
soggy
cig
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
and
back
again
sure
that
cool
with
me
he
turned
to
the
other
sellers
you
guys
do
mind
do
you
they
joked
and
laughed
and
said
no
perry
let
out
a
breath
slowly
these
guys
want
a
confrontation
with
the
cops
they
knew
better
than
him
that
they
could
win
that
one
suzanne
started
interviewing
them
the
cops
got
out
of
their
cars
and
stared
at
them
the
woman
cop
had
her
mirrorshades
on
now
and
so
the
both
of
them
looked
hard
and
eyeless
perry
looked
away
quickly
the
vendors
with
cars
were
pulling
them
around
to
the
roadside
leading
up
to
the
ride
unpacking
merchandise
and
setting
it
out
on
their
hoods
vendors
from
the
shantytown
headed
home
and
came
back
with
folding
tables
and
blankets
these
guys
were
they
were
going
to
let
the
law
stand
in
the
way
of
putting
food
on
the
table
for
their
families
the
cops
got
back
into
their
cars
kettlewell
worked
his
way
cautiously
across
the
freeway
climbing
laboriously
over
the
median
he
had
changed
into
a
smart
blazer
and
slacks
with
a
crisp
white
shirt
that
hid
his
incipient
belly
he
looked
like
the
kettlewell
of
old
the
kind
of
man
used
to
giving
orders
and
getting
respect
hey
man
perry
said
kettlewell
easy
smile
was
reassuring
perry
he
said
throwing
an
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
leading
him
away
come
here
and
talk
with
me
they
stood
in
the
lee
of
one
of
the
sickly
palms
that
stood
by
the
roadside
the
day
was
coming
up
hot
and
perry
stuck
to
his
chest
though
kettlewell
seemed
dry
and
in
control
what
going
on
perry
well
we
did
a
phoner
this
morning
with
all
the
ride
operators
they
going
to
work
on
raising
money
for
the
defense
and
getting
lawyers
from
the
eff
or
the
aclu
or
something
kettlewell
did
a
wait
what
they
going
to
ask
the
aclu
they
ca
be
trusted
perry
they
they
take
cases
to
make
a
point
even
when
it
not
in
their
clients
best
interests
what
could
be
more
in
our
interests
than
getting
lawyers
to
fight
these
bogus
injunctions
kettlewell
blew
out
a
long
breath
ok
table
it
table
it
what
i
been
pulling
together
we
got
a
shitkicking
corporate
firm
that
used
to
handle
the
kodacell
business
that
sending
out
a
partner
to
go
to
the
broward
county
court
this
morning
to
get
the
injunction
lifted
they
doing
this
as
a
freebie
but
i
told
them
that
they
could
handle
the
business
if
we
put
together
all
the
rides
into
one
entity
now
it
was
perry
turn
to
boggle
what
kind
of
entity
we
have
to
incorporate
them
all
get
them
all
under
one
umbrella
so
that
we
can
defend
them
all
in
one
go
otherwise
there
no
way
going
to
be
able
to
save
them
without
a
corporate
entity
it
like
trying
to
herd
cats
besides
you
need
some
kind
of
structure
a
formal
constitution
or
something
for
this
thing
you
got
a
network
protocol
and
that
it
there
money
at
stake
here
potentially
some
big
money
and
you
ca
run
something
like
that
on
a
handshake
it
too
vulnerable
you
get
embezzled
or
sued
into
oblivion
before
you
even
have
a
chance
to
grow
so
i
started
the
paperwork
to
get
everything
under
one
banner
perry
counted
to
ten
backwards
landon
i
really
thankful
that
you
helping
us
out
here
you
probably
going
to
save
our
asses
but
you
ca
put
everything
under
one
banner
you
ca
just
declare
to
these
people
that
their
projects
are
ours
of
course
they
yours
they
using
your
ip
your
protocols
your
designs
if
they
do
come
on
board
you
can
just
threaten
to
sue
them
landon
please
listen
to
me
we
are
not
going
to
effect
a
hostile
takeover
of
my
friends
they
are
equal
owners
of
everything
we
do
here
and
no
offense
but
if
you
ever
mention
suing
other
projects
over
our
he
made
sarcastic
finger
quotes
then
through
having
any
discussions
about
this
ok
kettlewell
snorted
air
through
his
nostrils
my
apologies
i
realize
that
this
was
such
a
sensitive
area
for
you
perry
boggled
at
this
lawsuits
against
ride
operators
but
i
can
get
that
the
thing
perry
without
some
kind
of
structure
going
to
be
dead
even
if
we
repel
the
boarders
this
morning
be
back
tomorrow
and
the
day
after
you
need
something
stronger
than
a
bunch
of
friends
who
have
loose
agreements
you
need
a
legal
entity
that
can
speak
for
everyone
maybe
that
a
or
a
charity
or
something
else
but
it
got
to
exist
you
may
not
think
you
have
any
say
over
these
other
rides
but
does
everyone
else
agree
what
if
you
get
sued
for
someone
bad
deeds
in
minneapolis
what
if
some
ride
operator
sues
to
put
you
out
of
business
perry
head
swam
he
hated
conversations
like
this
he
did
have
any
good
answer
for
kettlewell
objections
but
it
was
ridiculous
no
one
from
a
ride
was
going
to
sue
him
or
maybe
they
would
if
he
got
all
grabby
and
went
mine
mine
mine
and
incorporated
everything
with
him
at
the
top
hilda
said
he
was
the
one
they
all
looked
to
but
that
was
because
he
would
never
try
to
hijack
their
projects
no
no
what
no
to
all
of
it
we
have
to
defend
this
thing
but
we
not
going
to
do
it
by
trying
to
tie
everyone
down
to
contracts
and
agreements
where
i
get
to
control
everything
maybe
a
is
the
right
way
to
go
but
we
ca
just
declare
a
and
force
everyone
to
be
members
we
have
to
get
everyone
to
agree
everyone
who
involved
and
then
they
can
elect
a
council
or
something
and
work
out
some
kind
of
uniform
agreement
i
mean
that
how
all
the
good
free
software
projects
work
there
authority
but
it
not
all
unilateral
and
imperious
i
not
interested
in
that
i
rather
shut
this
down
than
declare
myself
of
kettlewell
scrubbed
his
eyes
with
his
fists
up
close
the
lines
in
his
face
were
his
eyeballs
bloodshot
and
hung
over
killing
me
you
know
that
what
good
is
principle
going
to
do
when
they
knock
this
fucking
thing
down
and
slap
you
with
a
gigantic
lawsuit
perry
shrugged
i
really
appreciate
what
you
done
but
i
rather
lose
it
than
fuck
it
up
they
stared
at
each
other
for
a
long
time
cars
whizzed
past
perry
felt
like
a
big
jerk
kettlewell
had
done
amazing
work
for
him
this
morning
just
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
own
heart
and
perry
had
repaid
him
by
being
a
dickwad
he
felt
an
overwhelming
desire
to
take
it
back
just
put
kettlewell
in
charge
and
let
him
run
the
whole
show
just
shrug
his
shoulders
and
abdicate
he
looked
down
at
the
ground
and
up
into
the
straggly
palms
then
heaved
a
sigh
landon
i
sorry
ok
but
that
just
how
it
is
i
totally
dig
that
you
saying
that
we
risking
everything
by
not
doing
it
your
way
but
from
my
seat
doing
it
your
way
will
kill
it
anyway
so
we
need
a
better
answer
kettlewell
scrubbed
his
eyes
some
more
you
and
my
wife
sound
like
you
get
along
perry
waited
for
him
to
go
on
but
it
became
clear
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
perry
went
back
to
the
cop
cars
just
as
the
first
gang
of
goths
showed
up
to
take
a
ride
part
iii
sammy
had
filled
a
cooler
and
stuck
it
in
the
of
his
car
the
night
before
programmed
his
and
when
his
alarm
roused
him
at
he
hit
the
road
first
he
guzzled
his
thermos
of
lethal
coffee
then
reached
around
in
back
for
bottles
of
icy
distilled
water
he
kept
the
windows
rolled
down
and
breathed
in
the
swampy
cool
morning
air
the
most
promising
air
of
the
florida
day
before
it
all
turned
to
steam
and
sizzle
he
did
bother
looking
for
when
he
needed
to
piss
just
pulled
over
on
the
turnpike
side
and
let
fly
why
not
at
that
hour
it
was
just
him
and
the
truckers
and
the
tourists
with
morning
flights
he
reached
miami
ahead
of
schedule
and
had
a
big
enough
to
kill
a
lesser
man
a
real
fatkins
affair
he
got
back
on
the
road
groaning
from
the
chow
and
made
it
to
the
old
just
as
the
merchants
were
setting
up
their
market
on
the
roadside
when
he
done
the
boston
ride
he
been
discouraged
that
they
kept
on
with
their
xmas
even
though
he
grinched
away
all
their
fun
but
this
time
he
was
expecting
something
like
this
watching
these
guys
sell
souvenirs
at
the
funeral
for
the
ride
made
him
feel
pretty
good
this
time
around
their
disloyalty
had
to
be
a
real
for
those
the
cops
were
getting
twitchy
which
made
him
grin
twitchy
cops
were
a
key
ingredient
for
bad
trouble
he
reached
behind
him
and
pulled
an
iced
coffee
from
the
cooler
and
cracked
it
listening
to
the
hiss
as
the
embedded
cartridge
forced
bubbles
through
it
now
here
came
a
suit
he
looked
like
a
genuine
mighty
morphin
power
broker
which
made
sammy
worry
because
a
guy
like
that
had
figured
into
his
plans
but
look
at
that
he
was
having
a
huge
fight
with
the
eyebrow
guy
and
now
the
eyebrow
guy
was
running
away
from
him
getting
the
lawyers
to
agree
to
spring
the
budget
to
file
in
every
location
where
there
was
a
ride
had
been
tricky
sammy
had
had
to
fudge
a
little
on
his
research
claim
that
they
were
bringing
in
real
money
tie
it
to
the
drop
in
numbers
in
florida
and
generally
do
a
song
and
dance
but
it
was
all
worth
it
these
guys
clearly
know
whether
to
shit
or
go
blind
now
eyebrow
man
was
headed
for
the
and
the
entrance
and
there
oh
yes
there
it
was
five
cars
worth
of
goths
lugging
bags
full
of
some
kind
of
or
scavenged
pulling
up
short
at
the
entrance
they
piled
out
of
their
cars
and
started
milling
around
asking
questions
some
approached
the
cops
who
seemed
in
no
mood
to
chat

be

eyebrow
oh

four
more
cars
pulled
up
now
the
shoulder
was
getting
really
crowded
and
freeway
traffic
was
slowing
to
a
crawl
more
goths
piled
out
family
cars
approached
the
snarl
slowed
then
sped
up
again
not
wanting
to
risk
the
craziness
maybe
some
of
them
would
get
on
the
fucking
turnpike
and
drive
up
to
orlando
where
the
real
fun
was
the
road
was
down
to
about
a
lane
and
a
half
and
milling
crowds
from
the
shantytown
and
the
arriving
cars
were
clogging
what
remained
of
the
thoroughfare
now
goths
were
parking
their
cars
way
back
at
the
intersection
and
walking
over
carrying
the
objects
planned
to
sacrifice
to
the
ride
and
smoking
clove
cigarettes
sammy
saw
death
waits
before
death
waits
turned
his
head
and
so
sammy
had
time
to
duck
down
before
he
was
spotted
he
giggled
to
himself
and
chugged
his
coffee
crouched
down
below
the
window
the
situation
was
heating
up
now
lots
of
people
were
asking
questions
of
the
cops
people
trying
to
drive
through
got
shouted
at
by
the
people
in
the
road
sometimes
a
goth
would
slam
a
fist
down
on
a
hood
and
there
be
a
little
bit
of
back
and
forth
it
was
a
and
sammy
decided
to
touch
it
off
he
swung
his
car
out
into
the
road
and
hit
the
horn
and
revved
his
engine
driving
through
the
crowd
just
a
hair
faster
than
was
safe
people
slapped
his
car
as
it
went
by
and
he
just
leaned
on
the
horn
ploughing
through
scattering
people
who
knocked
over
tables
and
stepped
on
their
wares
in
his
he
saw
the
chaos
begin
someone
threw
a
punch
someone
slipped
someone
knocked
over
a
table
of
infringing
merch
party
time
he
hit
the
next
left
then
pointed
his
car
at
the
freeway
he
reached
back
and
snagged
another
can
of
coffee
and
went
to
work
on
it
as
the
can
hissed
open
he
could
help
himself
he
chuckled
then
he
laughed
a
full
loud
perry
watched
it
happen
as
though
it
were
all
a
dream
the
crowds
thickening
the
cops
getting
out
of
their
cars
and
putting
their
hands
on
their
belts
a
distant
siren
more
people
milling
around
hanging
out
in
the
middle
of
the
road
like
idiots
then
that
jerk
in
the
car
what
the
hell
was
he
thinking
he
was
going
to
kill
someone
and
then
it
all
exploded
there
was
a
knot
of
fighting
bodies
over
by
the
tables
and
the
knot
was
getting
bigger
the
cops
were
running
for
them
batons
out
out
perry
shouted
something
but
he
could
hear
himself
in
a
second
the
crowd
noises
had
gone
from
friendly
to
an
angry
roar
perry
spotted
suzanne
watching
it
all
through
the
viewfinder
on
her
phone
presumably
streaming
it
live
then
shouted
again
an
unheard
warning
as
a
combatant
behind
her
swung
wide
and
clocked
her
in
the
head
she
went
down
and
he
charged
for
her
he
just
reached
her
when
a
noise
went
off
that
dropped
him
to
his
knees
it
was
their
antipersonnel
which
meant
that
lester
was
around
here
somewhere
the
sound
was
a
physical
thing
it
made
his
bowels
loose
and
made
his
head
ring
like
a
gong
thought
was
impossible
everything
was
impossible
except
curling
up
and
wrapping
your
hands
around
your
head
painfully
he
raised
his
head
and
opened
his
eyes
all
around
him
people
were
on
their
knees
the
cops
though
had
put
giant
industrial
earmuffs
on
the
kind
of
thing
you
saw
jackhammer
operators
wearing
they
were
moving
rapidly
toward
lester
who
was
in
a
pickup
truck
with
the
ap
horn
stuck
in
the
cargo
bed
wired
into
the
cigarette
lighter
they
had
guns
drawn
and
lester
was
looking
at
them
hands
in
the
air
their
mouths
were
moving
but
whatever
they
were
saying
was
inaudible
perry
took
his
phone
out
of
his
pocket
and
aimed
it
at
them
he
could
move
without
spooking
them
and
possibly
knocking
himself
out
from
the
sound
but
he
could
rodneyking
them
as
they
advanced
on
lester
he
could
practically
read
lester
thoughts
i
move
to
switch
this
off
they
shoot
me
dead
the
cops
closed
on
lester
and
then
the
sour
old
male
cop
was
up
in
the
bed
and
he
had
lester
by
the
collar
throwing
him
to
the
ground
pointing
his
gun
his
partner
moved
quickly
and
efficiently
around
the
bed
eventually
figuring
out
how
to
unplug
the
horn
the
silence
rang
in
his
head
he
could
hear
anything
except
a
whine
from
his
abused
eardrums
around
him
people
moved
sluggishly
painfully
he
got
to
his
feet
as
quick
as
he
could
and
to
the
truck
lester
was
already
in
plastic
cuffs
and
and
the
big
cop
was
watching
an
armored
police
bus
roll
toward
them
in
the
eerie
silence
of
their
collective
deafness
perry
managed
to
switch
his
phone
over
to
streaming
so
that
it
was
uploading
everything
instead
of
recording
it
locally
he
faded
back
behind
some
of
the
cars
for
cover
and
kept
rolling
as
the
riot
bus
disgorged
a
flying
squadron
of
helmeted
cops
who
began
to
methodically
and
savagely
grab
cuff
and
toss
the
groaning
crowd
lying
flat
on
the
ground
he
wanted
to
add
narration
but
he
did
trust
himself
to
whisper
since
he
could
hear
his
own
voice
a
hand
came
down
on
his
shoulder
and
he
jumped
squeaked
and
fell
into
a
defensive
pose
waiting
for
the
truncheon
to
hit
him
but
it
was
suzanne
grim
faced
pointing
her
own
phone
she
had
a
laminated
out
in
her
free
hand
and
was
holding
it
up
beside
her
head
like
a
talisman
she
pointed
off
down
the
road
where
some
of
the
goth
kids
who
just
been
arriving
when
things
went
down
were
more
ambulatory
having
been
somewhat
shielded
from
the
noise
they
were
running
and
being
chased
by
cops
she
made
a
little
scooting
gesture
and
perry
understood
that
she
meant
he
should
be
following
them
getting
the
video
he
sucked
in
a
big
breath
and
nodded
once
and
set
off
she
gave
his
hand
a
firm
squeeze
and
he
felt
that
her
palms
were
slick
with
sweat
he
kept
low
and
moved
slow
keeping
the
viewfinder
up
so
that
he
could
keep
the
melee
in
shot
he
hoped
like
hell
that
someone
watching
this
online
would
spring
for
his
bail
miraculously
he
reached
the
outlier
skirmish
without
being
spotted
he
recorded
the
cops
taking
the
goths
down
cuffing
them
and
hooding
one
kid
who
was
thrashing
like
a
fish
on
a
hook
it
seemed
that
he
would
never
be
spotted
he
crept
forward
slowly
slowly
trying
to
feel
invisible
and
unnoticed
trying
to
project
it
it
worked
he
was
getting
incredible
footage
he
was
practically
on
top
of
the
cops
before
anyone
noticed
him
then
there
was
a
shout
and
a
hand
grabbed
for
his
phone
and
the
spell
was
broken
suddenly
his
heart
was
thundering
his
pulse
pounding
in
his
ears
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
ran
a
mad
giggle
welled
up
in
his
chest
his
phone
was
still
streaming
presumably
showing
wild
nauseous
shots
of
the
landscape
swinging
past
as
he
pumped
his
arm
he
was
headed
for
the
ride
for
the
rear
entrance
where
he
knew
he
could
take
cover
he
felt
the
footsteps
thud
behind
him
dimly
heard
the
shouts
but
his
temporary
deafness
drowned
out
the
words
he
had
his
fob
out
before
he
reached
the
doors
and
he
badged
in
banging
the
fob
over
the
an
instant
before
slamming
into
the
and
the
doors
swung
open
he
waited
in
agitation
for
the
doors
to
hiss
shut
slowly
after
him
and
then
it
was
the
gloom
of
the
inside
of
the
ride
dark
in
his
eyesight
it
was
only
when
the
doors
shivered
behind
him
that
he
realized
what
he
just
done
they
break
in
and
come
and
get
him
and
in
the
process
they
destroy
the
ride
for
spite
his
eyes
were
adjusting
to
the
gloom
now
and
he
made
out
the
shapes
of
the
dioramas
now
black
and
lacy
with
goth
memorabilia
this
place
gave
him
calm
and
joy
he
would
keep
them
from
destroying
it
he
set
his
phone
down
on
the
floor
propped
against
a
plaster
skull
so
that
the
doorway
was
in
the
shot
he
walked
to
the
door
and
shouted
as
loud
as
he
could
his
voice
inaudible
in
his
own
ears
i
coming
out
now
he
shouted
i
opening
the
doors
he
waited
for
a
then
reached
for
the
lock
he
turned
it
and
let
the
door
crash
open
as
two
cops
in
came
through
at
the
fore
he
was
down
on
the
ground
writhing
and
clawing
at
his
face
in
an
instant
and
the
phone
caught
it
all
all
perry
wanted
was
for
someone
to
cut
the
plastic
cuffs
off
so
he
could
scrub
at
his
eyes
though
he
knew
that
would
only
make
it
worse
the
sounded
like
an
orgy
moaning
and
groaning
with
dozens
of
voices
every
time
the
bus
jounced
over
a
pothole
perry
was
on
the
floor
of
the
bus
next
to
a
kid
judging
from
the
voice
who
cursed
steadily
the
whole
way
along
one
hard
jounce
made
their
heads
connect
and
they
both
cussed
then
apologized
to
one
another
then
laughed
a
little
my
name
perry
his
voice
sounded
like
he
was
underwater
but
he
could
hear
the
pepper
spray
seemed
to
have
cleared
out
his
sinuses
and
given
him
back
some
of
his
hearing
i
death
waits
he
said
it
without
any
drama
perry
was
sure
if
he
heard
right
he
supposed
he
had
goth
kids
nice
to
meet
you
likewise
their
heads
were
banged
together
again
they
laughed
and
cursed
christ
my
face
hurts
perry
said
i
not
surprised
you
look
like
a
tomato
you
can
see
lucky
me
yup
i
got
a
pretty
good
couple
of
whacks
on
the
back
and
shoulders
once
i
was
down
but
no
gas
lucky
you
all
right
i
more
pissed
that
i
lost
the
tombstone
i
brought
down
it
was
a
real
rarity
and
it
was
hard
to
get
too
i
bet
it
got
tromped
tombstone
huh
from
the
graveyard
walk
at
disney
they
tore
it
down
last
week
and
you
were
bringing
it
to
add
it
to
the
ride
sure
that
where
it
belongs
perry
face
still
burned
but
the
pain
was
lessening
before
it
had
been
like
his
face
was
on
fire
now
it
was
like
a
million
fire
ants
biting
him
he
tried
to
put
it
out
of
his
mind
by
concentrating
on
the
pain
in
his
wrists
where
the
plastic
straps
were
cutting
into
him
why
there
was
a
long
silence
has
to
go
somewhere
better
there
than
in
a
vault
or
in
the
trash
how
about
selling
it
to
a
collector
you
know
it
never
occurred
to
me
it
means
too
much
to
go
to
a
collector
the
tombstone
means
too
much
i
know
it
sounds
stupid
but
it
true
you
heard
that
tearing
out
all
the
goth
stuff
fantasyland
meant
a
lot
to
some
of
us
you
did
feel
like
it
was
what
you
dude
you
can
buy
goth
clothes
at
a
chain
of
we
all
over
the
fight
if
disney
wants
to
put
together
a
goth
homeland
that
all
right
with
me
and
that
ride
it
was
the
best
place
to
remember
it
you
know
that
it
got
copied
over
every
night
to
other
rides
around
the
country
so
all
the
people
who
loved
the
old
disney
could
be
part
of
the
memorial
even
if
they
could
come
to
florida
we
had
the
idea
last
week
and
everyone
loved
it
so
you
were
putting
stuff
from
disney
rides
into
my
ride
your
ride
well
i
built
it
no
fucking
way
way
he
smiled
and
that
made
his
face
hurt
dude
that
is
the
coolest
thing
ever
you
built
that
how
did
how
do
you
become
the
kind
of
person
who
can
build
one
of
those
things
i
out
of
work
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
next
well
you
could
join
one
of
the
that
building
the
other
rides
sure
i
guess
but
i
want
to
be
the
kind
of
person
who
invents
the
idea
of
making
something
like
that
did
you
get
an
electrical
engineering
degree
or
something
just
picked
it
up
as
i
went
along
you
could
do
the
same
sure
but
hang
on
a
sec
you
were
putting
stuff
from
disney
rides
into
my
ride
well
yeah
but
it
was
stuff
they
torn
down
perry
eyes
streamed
this
could
be
a
coincidence
stuff
from
disney
rides
showing
up
in
his
ride
and
the
cops
turning
up
to
enforce
a
court
order
disney
got
but
he
could
blame
this
kid
who
sounded
like
a
real
wait
you
do
think
the
cops
were
there
because
probably
no
hard
feelings
though
i
might
have
done
the
same
in
your
shoes
oh
shit
i
am
i
did
think
it
through
at
i
can
see
that
now
of
course
they
come
after
you
they
must
totally
hate
you
i
used
to
work
there
they
just
hate
anything
that
takes
a
florida
tourist
dollar
it
why
they
built
the
monorail
extension
to
orlando
airport
to
make
sure
that
from
the
moment
you
get
off
the
plane
you
do
spend
a
nickel
on
anything
that
they
do
sell
you
i
used
to
think
it
was
cool
because
they
built
such
great
stuff
but
then
they
went
after
the
new
fantasyland
you
ca
be
a
citizen
of
a
themepark
perry
said
the
kid
barked
a
laugh
man
how
true
is
you
nailed
it
pal
perry
managed
to
crack
an
eye
painfully
and
catch
a
blurry
look
at
the
kid
a
black
edward
scissorhands
dandelion
clock
of
hair
eyeliner
but
a
with
cheeks
you
could
probably
see
from
the
back
of
his
head
about
as
threatening
as
a
smurf
perry
felt
a
sudden
delayed
rush
of
anger
how
they
beat
up
kids
like
this
death
waits
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
ride
a
goddamned
ride
he
was
a
criminal
was
out
rolling
old
ladies
or
releasing
malicious
bioorganisms
on
the
beach
the
bus
turned
a
sharp
corner
and
their
heads
banged
together
again
they
groaned
and
then
the
doors
were
being
opened
and
perry
squeezed
his
eyes
shut
again
rough
hands
seized
him
and
marched
him
into
the
station
house
the
crowd
susurrations
were
liquid
in
his
ears
he
smell
or
see
either
he
felt
like
he
was
in
some
kind
of
terrible
sensory
deprivation
nightmare
and
it
made
him
jerky
so
whenever
a
hand
took
him
and
guided
him
to
another
station
in
the
process
his
wallet
lifted
from
his
pocket
his
cheek
swabbed
his
fingers
pressed
against
a
fingerprint
scanner
he
flinched
involuntarily
the
hands
grew
rougher
and
more
insistent
at
one
point
someone
peeled
open
his
swollen
eyelid
a
feeling
like
being
stabbed
in
the
eye
and
his
retina
was
scanned
he
screamed
and
heard
laughter
distant
through
his
throbbing
eardrums
it
galvanized
him
he
forced
his
eyes
open
glaring
at
the
cops
around
him
mostly
they
were
florida
crackers
guys
with
expressions
of
impersonal
malevolence
there
was
a
tiny
smattering
of
brown
faces
and
women
faces
but
they
were
but
a
sprinkling
when
compared
to
the
dominant
somatype
of
florida
law
the
next
time
someone
grabbed
him
to
shove
him
towards
the
next
station
on
this
quest
he
jerked
his
arm
away
and
sat
down
he
seen
protestors
do
this
before
and
knew
that
it
was
hard
to
move
a
sitting
man
expeditiously
or
with
dignity
hands
seized
him
by
the
arms
and
he
flailed
until
he
was
free
remaining
firmly
seated
the
laughter
was
turning
to
anger
now
beside
him
someone
else
sat
death
waits
looking
and
more
people
hit
the
floor
a
was
shoved
under
his
arm
which
was
then
twisted
into
an
agonizing
position
he
was
suddenly
ready
to
give
up
the
fight
and
go
along
but
he
could
get
to
his
feet
fast
enough
with
a
sickening
his
arm
broke
he
had
a
moment
lucid
awareness
that
a
bone
had
broken
in
his
body
and
then
the
pain
was
on
him
and
he
choked
out
a
shout
then
a
louder
one
and
then
everything
went
dark
as
it
turned
out
his
prison
infirmary
time
did
last
long
at
all
kettlewell
had
faded
fast
from
the
riot
headed
back
to
the
guesthouse
and
got
the
lawyers
on
the
phone
he
shown
them
the
stream
off
of
perry
phone
and
they
were
in
front
of
a
judge
before
perry
reached
the
jail
perry
was
led
out
of
the
infirmary
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
his
face
was
still
painfully
swollen
and
he
managed
to
turn
an
ankle
as
well
at
least
his
hearing
was
coming
back
kettlewell
took
perry
good
arm
and
gave
him
a
soulful
hug
that
embarrassed
him
kettlewell
led
him
outside
to
where
a
big
cab
was
waiting
in
it
were
the
family
kettlewell
lester
and
suzanne
lester
had
a
couple
bandages
taped
to
his
face
and
when
suzanne
smiled
he
saw
her
lips
were
stained
red
and
one
of
her
front
teeth
had
been
knocked
out
he
managed
a
brave
smile
looks
like
you
guys
got
the
full
treatment
huh
suzanne
squeezed
his
hand
nothing
that
ca
be
fixed
ada
and
pascal
looked
at
them
ada
was
popping
korean
walnut
cakes
into
her
mouth
from
a
greasy
paper
bag
and
she
offered
them
silently
to
perry
who
took
one
just
to
be
polite
but
found
after
the
first
bite
that
he
was
really
hungry
after
all
kettlewell
and
perry
fought
about
what
to
do
next
but
kettlewell
prevailed
he
took
them
to
a
private
doctor
who
photographed
them
and
examined
them
and
them
documenting
everything
while
ada
kettlewell
played
with
her
phone
videoing
it
all
i
do
think
suing
the
police
is
going
to
help
landon
perry
said
suzanne
nodded
vigorously
the
three
victims
were
in
paper
examining
gowns
and
the
kettlewells
were
still
in
street
clothes
which
gave
them
a
real
advantage
in
the
department
it
help
if
we
cash
out
a
big
settlement
it
bankroll
our
defense
against
the
disney
trademark
claims
ip
lawyers
charge
more
than
god
per
hour
i
got
the
injunction
lifted
but
we
still
going
to
have
to
go
to
court
and
that
not
going
to
be
cheap
it
needled
perry
he
did
like
the
idea
of
being
embroiled
in
the
legal
system
in
the
first
place
and
while
he
could
grudgingly
admit
a
certain
elegance
in
using
cash
settlements
from
the
law
to
fund
their
defense
in
court
the
whole
business
made
him
squirm
eva
sat
down
beside
him
i
can
tell
this
sucks
for
you
perry
ada
whispered
the
word
and
giggled
and
eva
rolled
her
eyes
but
there
fifty
people
we
bail
out
in
there
who
are
all
of
them
going
to
have
to
figure
out
their
own
way
through
the
legal
system
you
ca
run
a
business
if
your
customers
risk
a
solid
beating
and
jail
time
just
for
showing
up
do
want
to
run
a
business
he
thought
but
he
knew
that
was
petulant
he
was
the
man
with
the
roll
of
bills
down
his
pants
there
are
fifty
people
still
in
the
slam
kettlewell
nodded
suzanne
had
her
camera
out
and
she
was
recording
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
perry
had
really
felt
the
camera
eye
on
him
it
was
one
thing
to
be
recorded
by
some
friends
for
remembrance
but
now
suzanne
camera
seemed
like
the
gaze
of
posterity
he
needed
to
rise
to
it
he
knew
let
get
them
out
all
of
them
kettlewell
raised
his
eyebrows
and
how
do
you
plan
on
doing
that
we
charge
it
to
the
business
perry
said
lester
chuckled
and
gave
him
a
thump
on
the
back
it
a
legit
expense
these
are
our
after
all
kettlewell
shook
his
head
at
all
of
them
then
he
left
the
office
he
already
had
his
phone
stuck
to
his
head
and
was
talking
with
the
lawyer
before
he
got
out
of
earshot
perry
and
lester
and
suzanne
and
eva
exchanged
mischievous
glances
grinning
with
unexpected
delight
pascal
riding
on
eva
hip
woke
up
and
started
crying
and
eva
handed
him
to
lester
while
she
went
for
the
diaper
bag
here
we
go
again
lester
said
wrinkling
his
nose
and
holding
the
wailing
pascal
at
arm
length
suzanne
got
it
all
with
her
phone
then
she
flipped
it
shut
and
gave
lester
a
hard
kiss
on
the
cheek
fatherhood
would
suit
you
she
said
he
went
bright
red
do
you
get
any
ideas
he
said
suzanne
laughed
and
skipped
away
looking
all
of
ten
perry
felt
huge
larger
than
life
the
adventure
was
beginning
anew
with
these
good
people
whom
he
loved
like
family
he
had
the
work
and
the
people
and
who
needed
anything
more
it
was
a
feeling
that
lasted
all
the
way
back
to
the
ride
but
then
he
surveyed
the
ride
itself
and
found
it
in
utter
ruins
far
worse
than
it
had
been
left
when
he
been
dragged
out
of
it
every
single
exhibit
was
smashed
strewn
here
and
there
he
could
believe
it
he
brought
up
the
lights
flooding
the
place
and
then
he
saw
what
he
missed
at
first
the
smashed
exhibits
were
not
smashed
exhibits
they
were
of
smashed
exhibits
at
every
ride
in
the
country
police
had
gone
in
smashing
and
every
other
ride
in
the
country
had
faithfully
reproduced
the
damage
dutiful
printers
churning
out
replica
detritus
and
dutiful
robots
placing
it
with
micrometer
precision
he
began
to
laugh
and
could
stop
lester
came
in
and
immediately
got
the
joke
and
laughed
along
with
him
they
managed
to
stop
laughing
just
long
enough
to
explain
it
to
suzanne
and
kettlewell
who
find
it
nearly
as
funny
as
they
did
suzanne
took
pictures
finally
he
got
down
to
business
opening
the
and
rolling
the
ride
back
through
the
revisions
to
its
unsmashed
state
it
would
take
the
robots
a
long
time
to
set
everything
right
again
but
at
least
he
did
have
to
oversee
it
instead
he
tracked
down
as
many
of
the
vendors
as
he
could
locate
in
the
shantytown
and
made
sure
they
were
all
right
they
were
though
they
lost
some
inventory
he
comped
them
all
a
month
rent
and
made
sure
they
knew
that
steps
were
being
taken
to
keep
it
from
happening
again
he
knew
that
they
could
make
nearly
as
much
money
selling
from
a
roadside
or
online
and
he
wanted
to
keep
them
happy
besides
it
was
their
fault
he
was
exhausted
and
his
arm
was
really
starting
to
gripe
him
he
found
himself
stopping
in
the
street
every
few
steps
to
rub
his
eyes
and
force
himself
on
francis
came
on
him
when
he
was
like
that
leaning
against
the
prefab
concrete
wall
of
one
of
the
tall
twisty
shanties
and
he
took
perry
away
and
drove
him
home
perry
was
in
too
much
of
a
state
by
the
time
he
got
there
to
think
about
how
francis
would
get
back
he
was
already
lying
in
bed
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
old
man
with
the
gimpy
leg
probably
walked
the
ten
miles
home
he
woke
up
later
that
night
to
sex
noises
from
lester
room
and
he
recognized
suzanne
voice
later
he
woke
again
to
hear
the
tail
end
of
another
argument
between
lester
and
suzanne
and
then
suzanne
storming
out
of
the
apartment
he
thought
he
lay
on
his
back
trying
to
find
sleep
again
the
clock
said
and
found
thoughts
of
hilda
drifting
unbidden
into
his
mind
it
was
silly
they
only
spent
one
night
together
and
he
had
to
admit
that
as
great
as
the
sex
had
been
he
had
better
with
the
fatkins
gymnasts
you
could
pick
up
down
on
south
beach
she
was
too
young
for
him
she
lived
in
but
there
were
touches
in
the
ride
that
had
originated
with
her
instantiation
he
looked
over
the
logs
every
now
and
then
and
he
found
himself
contemplating
them
with
sentimental
smiles
he
fell
asleep
again
and
only
woke
when
he
rolled
over
on
his
bad
arm
and
yelped
himself
awake
the
smell
of
waffles
bacon
and
eggs
was
strong
in
the
apartment
he
could
be
bothered
to
figure
out
how
to
shower
with
his
cast
on
so
he
pulled
on
a
pair
of
shorts
and
let
himself
into
the
living
room
lester
was
at
the
stove
cooking
up
half
a
pig
and
pouring
maple
batter
into
the
he
waved
a
spatula
at
him
and
pointed
out
at
the
terrace
perry
stepped
out
and
saw
suzanne
and
tjan
and
little
kids
what
were
their
names
lyenitchka
and
the
little
boy
man
the
whole
family
was
here
your
arm
is
broken
lyenitchka
said
pointing
at
him
perry
nodded
gravely
that
true
want
to
sign
my
cast
he
was
pretty
sure
that
he
had
a
that
would
mark
the
surface
though
the
hospital
had
sworn
that
it
would
shed
dirt
ink
and
anything
else
he
threw
at
it
she
nodded
vigorously
tjan
looked
him
over
and
gave
a
little
wave
then
perry
went
back
into
the
living
room
and
asked
his
computer
to
find
the
thought
you
be
busy
in
boston
he
said
while
lyenitchka
painstakingly
spelled
out
her
name
going
over
the
letters
to
get
them
to
show
up
dark
the
cast
surface
really
did
want
to
suck
up
any
tint
boston
came
out
we
had
lawyers
on
tap
at
the
start
and
the
vibe
was
cool
i
incorporated
there
so
it
was
easier
than
you
guys
had
it
but
some
of
the
others
were
hit
bad
like
san
francisco
and
madison
perry
was
alarmed
by
how
alarmed
he
sounded
mass
arrests
the
cops
there
are
real
with
all
this
antipersonnel
gear
left
over
from
the
riots
perry
jerked
and
spoiled
lyenitchka
writing
he
patted
her
head
and
set
his
arm
back
down
where
she
could
get
at
it
he
groaned
they
mostly
still
in
we
trying
to
get
them
bailed
out
but
the
judge
at
the
arraignment
set
bail
pretty
high
i
post
it
perry
said
i
can
put
up
my
savings
or
something
tjan
looked
uncomfortable
perry
there
are
people
in
the
lockup
in
wisconsin
some
of
them
are
going
to
skip
out
it
nearly
a
certainty
if
you
bail
them
all
out
you
go
broke
i
mean
good
to
see
you
and
i
sorry
you
got
hurt
and
all
respect
but
be
an
idiot
perry
felt
himself
go
belligerent
his
hands
went
into
fists
and
his
broken
wing
protested
that
brought
him
back
to
reality
he
forced
himself
to
smile
there
a
girl
in
madison
i
want
to
make
sure
she
tjan
and
suzanne
stared
at
him
for
a
second
then
lester
clapped
him
across
the
back
from
behind
him
startling
him
and
making
him
squeak
big
fella
he
crowed
i
should
have
known
perry
gave
him
a
mock
glare
have
no
right
to
say
on
this
score
he
darted
a
glance
at
suzanne
and
saw
that
she
was
blushing
tjan
took
this
in
and
nodded
as
though
his
suspicions
had
just
been
confirmed
fair
enough
tjan
said
let
make
some
inquiries
about
the
young
lady
what
her
name
hilda
hammersen
tjan
eyebrows
shot
up
hilda
from
the
mailing
lists
hilda
hilda
was
the
queen
of
the
mailing
lists
brash
quick
and
argumentative
but
never
the
kind
of
person
who
started
flamewars
hilda
arguments
were
hot
and
fast
and
she
always
won
perry
had
watched
her
admiringly
from
the
sidelines
only
weighing
in
occasionally
but
he
seemed
to
remember
now
that
taken
tjan
to
the
cleaners
once
on
an
issue
of
protocol
resolution
that
the
one
perry
said
i
always
pictured
her
as
being
about
fifty
with
a
machete
between
her
teeth
lester
said
no
offense
lyenitchka
go
get
my
phone
from
my
perry
said
patting
the
girl
on
the
shoulder
when
she
got
back
he
went
through
his
photos
of
hilda
with
them
lester
made
a
and
suzanne
punched
him
in
the
shoulder
and
took
the
phone
away
she
very
pretty
suzanne
said
disapprovingly
and
very
young
oh
yes
dating
younger
people
is
sleazy
lester
said
with
a
chuckle
suzanne
squirmed
and
even
perry
had
to
laugh
guys
here
it
is
i
need
to
spring
hilda
and
we
need
to
do
something
about
all
those
customers
and
supporters
and
so
on
who
went
to
jail
today
we
need
to
fight
all
the
injunctions
all
of
them
and
prevent
them
from
recurring
and
we
need
to
eat
breakfast
which
is
ready
lester
said
gesturing
at
the
table
behind
him
which
was
stacked
high
with
waffles
sausages
eggs
toast
and
pitchers
of
juice
and
carafes
of
coffee
lyenitchka
and
sasha
looked
at
each
other
and
ran
to
the
table
taking
seats
next
to
one
another
the
adults
followed
and
soon
they
were
eating
perry
managed
a
waffle
and
a
sausage
but
then
he
went
off
to
his
room
hilda
was
in
the
slam
in
madison
and
who
the
hell
knew
what
the
antipersonnel
stuff
the
madison
cops
used
had
done
to
her
he
just
wanted
to
get
on
a
fucking
plane
and
halfway
through
his
shower
he

a
couple
more
painkillers

walked

living
room

as
soon

the
security
at
the
airport
went
bonkers
over
him
the
perfect
storm
a
fresh
arrest
a
suspicious
cast
and
a
ticket
bought
with
cash
he
missed
the
first
two
flights
to
chicago
but
by
he
was
landing
at
and
submitting
to
an
interim
screening
procedure
before
boarding
for
madison
his
phone
rang
in
the
middle
of
the
screening
and
the
wrinkly
old
tsa
primly
informed
him
that
he
might
as
well
get
that
since
once
the
phone
rings
they
have
to
start
the
procedure
over
again
tjan
he
said
they
ca
spring
her
today
tomorrow
though
he
closed
his
eyes
and
shut
out
the
tsa
goon
she
had
a
huge
bouffant
of
copper
hair
and
a
midwesterner
sense
of
proportionality
when
it
came
to
and
rouge
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
who
could
call
you
honey
and
make
it
sound
like
islamofascist
faggot
why
not
tjan
there
was
a
pause
she
in
the
infirmary
and
they
wo
release
her
until
tomorrow
infirmary
nothing
serious
she
took
a
knock
on
the
head
and
they
want
to
hold
her
for
observation
he
pictured
a
copper
electrified
coming
down
on
shining
blond
hair
and
felt
like
throwing
up
perry
buddy
she
ok
really
i
had
our
lawyer
visit
her
in
the
prison
infirmary
and
she
swears
she
looks
great
the
lawyer
name
is
candice
take
a
cab
to
her
office
from
the
airport
ok
why
is
she
in
the
prison
infirmary
tjan
why
ca
she
be
moved
to
a
real
hospital
it
just
a
liability
thing
the
police
do
want
to
risk
the
suit
if
she
goes
complicated
on
them
between
hospitals
jesus
seriously
she
fine
we
got
a
good
lawyer
on
the
scene
but
perry
had
a
bad
feeling
the
tsa
goon
picked
up
on
it
and
gave
him
a
little
bit
of
extra
attention
acting
nervous
or
agitated
in
an
airport
was
a
ticket
to
a
cavity
search
but
then
he
was
lifting
off
and
headed
for
madison
and
though
the
time
crawled
on
the
flight
it
was
after
all
only
an
hour
he
even
napped
briefly
though
a
sky
marshall
woke
him
shortly
after
for
a
random
his
fellow
passengers
badly
dressed
midwesterners
and
a
couple
of
hipster
students
all
turned
their
bags
out
in
the
cramped
cabin
and
then
got
back
in
their
seats
for
the
landing
perry
had
meant
to
phone
in
a
car
reservation
at
but
the
extra
search
had
eaten
up
the
time
he
allocated
for
it
and
now
all
the
rental
counters
were
sold
out
reluctantly
he
got
into
a
taxi
and
asked
the
driver
to
take
him
to
the
office
of
the
lawyers
that
tjan
had
hired
the
cabbie
was
a
young
african
kid
with
a
shaved
head
he
had
a
dent
in
one
temple
and
more
dents
in
one
of
his
wrists
visible
as
he
let
his
long
hands
drape
over
the
steering
wheel
i
know
where
it
is
he
said
when
perry
gave
him
the
address
that
lawyer
she
is
very
good
she
helped
me
with
the
homeland
security
the
kid
was
young
or
with
a
studious
air
despite
his
old
injuries
he
reminded
perry
of
the
shantytowners
people
who
always
get
medical
attention
for
their
ailments
people
who
were
often
missing
a
tooth
or
two
who
had
mysterious
lumps
from
bones
or
scars
or
funny
eyebrows
like
his
the
midwesterners
on
the
plane
had
been
flawless
as
but
perry
friends
and
this
african
kid
looked
like
something
carved
out
of
coal
and
chalk
perry
was
one
big
jitter
from
the
trip
and
the
coffee
and
the
pills
for
his
arm
but
he
found
himself
drawn
into
conversation
as
they
whizzed
past
the
fields
and
malls
the
factories
and
i
from
gulu
in
uganda
there
has
been
civil
war
there
for
thirty
five
years
i
studied
chemical
engineering
through
the
african
virtual
university
and
qualified
for
a
chavez
scholarship
here
in
madison
his
accent
was
light
but
exotic
the
african
rolling
of
the
rs
the
but
the
homeland
security
did
want
to
renew
my
visa
last
year
they
said
i
had
financial
irregularities
i
was
paypalling
to
a
friend
in
kampala
who
withdrew
it
in
shillings
and
sent
it
to
my
family
in
giros
homeland
security
said
that
i
was
i
thought
i
be
sent
away
or
put
in
prison
but
ms
candice
wrote
them
a
letter
and
they
vanished
he
snapped
his
long
knuckly
fingers
for
emphasis
jesus
well
that
good
she
going
to
help
me
get
my
girlfriend
out
of
jail
perry
realized
he
just
called
hilda
his
girlfriend
which
would
be
news
to
her
but
there
it
was
you
do
need
to
worry
she
get
your
friend
free
perry
nodded
and
tried
to
close
his
eyes
and
relax
he
could
what
the
hell
had
happened
to
the
world
it
had
seemed
so
exciting
when
his
father
was
bringing
home
new
shapes
he
spun
off
his
rig
when
perry
had
started
to
trade
designs
with
people
to
effortlessly
find
people
on
the
net
who
wanted
to
collaborate
with
him
and
when
perry
had
started
a
business
making
cool
art
out
of
free
junk
and
selling
it
off
an
internet
connection
that
was
likewise
free
free
free
free
no
need
to
talk
to
a
government
or
grovel
for
a
curator
or
put
up
with
an
agent
or
a
boss
he
just
assumed
all
along
that
he
end
up
living
in
a
world
where
all
those
parasites
and
bullies
and
middlemen
would
just
blow
away
in
the
wind
but
they
all
found
jobs
in
the
new
world
they
were
needed
anymore
but
that
did
mean
that
they
went
away
now
they
were
wanding
him
in
airports
and
suing
him
for
trademark
infringement
and
busting
his
girlfriend
and
breaking
his
arm
and
giving
hassle
to
this
poor
african
kid
who
taught
himself
to
be
an
engineer
with
a
ferchrissakes
he
another
and
then
remembered
that
taking
the
pills
meant
he
would
be
able
to
get
a
drink
which
he
could
sure
as
shit
use
my
name
perry
he
said
richard
the
driver
said
we
almost
there
perry
i
wish
you
the
very
best
of
luck
you
too
he
said
the
driver
shook
his
hand
warmly
after
getting
his
luggage
out
of
the
trunk
a
limp
handshake
by
north
american
standards
but
gentle
and
friendly
nonetheless
his
dented
wrist
flexed
oddly
as
the
bones
there
moved
the
lawyer
office
was
not
what
perry
was
expecting
it
looked
like
someone
living
room
with
a
couple
of
overstuffed
sofas
a
dozing
cat
and
the
lawyer
candice
who
was
a
woman
in
her
she
dressed
in
jeans
and
an
oversized
uw
sweatshirt
with
a
laptop
perched
on
one
knee
she
had
a
friendly
open
face
framed
with
lots
of
curly
brown
hair
you
must
be
perry
she
said
setting
the
laptop
down
and
giving
him
an
unexpected
hug
that
was
from
hilda
i
saw
her
a
couple
hours
ago
she
was
very
adamant
that
i
pass
it
on
to
you
nice
to
meet
you
he
said
accepting
a
cup
of
tea
from
an
insulated
jug
on
a
cardboard
hilda
is
all
right
sit
down
the
lawyer
said
perry
stomach
turned
a
somersault
hilda
all
right
sit
perry
sat
she
was
gassed
with
a
neurotoxin
that
has
given
her
a
temporary
but
severe
form
of
parkinson
disease
normally
it
just
renders
people
immobile
but
one
in
a
million
has
a
reaction
like
this
it
just
bad
luck
that
hilda
was
one
of
them
she
was
they
all
were
there
was
a
hell
of
a
fight
as
i
understand
it
it
really
looks
like
it
was
the
cops
fault
someone
told
them
that
there
were
printed
guns
in
the
and
they
used
extreme
and
disproportionate
force
i
see
perry
said
his
blood
whooshed
in
his
ears
printed
guns
no
frigging
way
sure
in
some
of
the
exhibits
but
nothing
that
fired
anything
he
felt
tears
begin
to
stream
down
his
face
the
lawyer
moved
to
his
sofa
and
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulders
she
going
to
be
fine
candice
said
the
parkinson
is
rare
but
it
goes
away
in
percent
of
the
the
cases
where
it
occurs
what
this
means
is
that
we
got
an
amazing
chance
of
taking
a
huge
bite
out
of
the
local
law
that
we
can
use
to
fund
future
defense
tjan
told
me
that
that
the
strategy
and
i
think
it
sound
plus
the
harder
we
hit
the
law
today
the
more
reluctant
they
be
to
rush
off
the
next
time
someone
trumps
up
a
bs
trademark
claim
it
could
be
much
worse
perry
there
a
kid
who
lost
an
eye
to
a
rubber
bullet
perry
fisted
the
tears
away
let
go
get
her
he
said
they
say
she
should
be
moved
candice
said
what
does
our
doctor
say
i
phoned
a
couple
mds
this
afternoon
and
got
conflicting
stories
everyone
agrees
that
not
moving
her
is
safer
than
moving
her
though
the
only
disagreement
is
about
how
dangerous
it
would
be
to
move
her
let
go
see
her
then
that
we
can
do
perry
had
trouble
with
the
search
at
the
prison
hospital
his
cast
and
their
scanners
did
get
along
and
they
could
be
satisfied
with
a
hand
search
for
a
couple
minutes
it
looked
like
he
was
going
to
be
kept
out
but
candice
who
had
changed
into
a
before
they
left
the
office
put
on
a
stern
voice
and
demanded
to
speak
to
the
duty
sergeant
and
then
to
his
commanding
officer
and
in
ten
minutes
they
were
on
the
hospital
ward
where
the
beds
had
prisoners
handcuffed
to
them
hilda
she
looked
sunken
and
sick
her
face
slack
and
her
jaw
askew
her
eyes
opened
and
rolled
crazily
they
focused
on
him
her
body
shook
through
two
waves
of
tremors
before
she
was
able
to
raise
a
shaking
hand
toward
him
trailing
iv
tubes
she
was
trying
to
say
his
name
but
it
would
come
out
just
a
series
of
plosive
ps
but
then
he
took
her
hand
and
felt
its
fine
warmth
the
calluses
he
remembered
from
all
those
months
ago
and
he
felt
better
actually
better
felt
some
peace
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
hello
hilda
he
said
and
he
was
smiling
so
broadly
his
face
hurt
and
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
and
dripping
off
his
nose
and
running
into
his
mouth
she
was
weeping
too
her
head
vibrating
like
a
he
bent
over
her
and
took
her
head
in
his
hands
burying
them
in
her
thick
blond
hair
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
she
shook
under
him
but
she
kissed
him
back
he
could
feel
her
lips
move
on
his
they
kissed
for
a
long
time
he
subconsciously
took
note
of
the
fact
that
candice
had
moved
back
giving
them
some
privacy
when
the
kiss
broke
he
had
an
overwhelming
desire
to
tell
her
he
loved
her
but
they
had
taken
that
step
yet
and
maybe
a
prison
hospital
bed
was
the
right
place
to
make
pronouncements
of
love
i
love
you
he
said
softly
in
her
ear
kissing
the
lobe
i
love
you
hilda
she
cried
harder
and
made
choking
sobs
he
hugged
her
as
hard
as
he
dared
candice
came
back
and
stood
by
them
they
think
that
she
be
better
in
the
morning
she
already
much
better
off
than
she
was
just
a
couple
hours
ago
sleep
the
only
thing
for
it
they
got
her
mildly
sedated
too
hilda
smelled
like
he
remembered
the
undersmell
beneath
her
shampoo
and
the
chemicals
clinging
to
her
hair
it
took
him
back
to
their
night
together
and
he
stroked
her
cheek
i
stay
here
he
said
i
do
think
that
they
going
to
let
you
do
that
perry
this
is
a
prison
not
a
hospital
i
stay
here
he
said
again
just
make
it
happen
ok
we
going
to
sue
them
into
a
smoking
hole
right
that
got
to
give
us
some
leverage
i
stay
here
she
sighed
and
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
but
he
would
take
his
eyes
off
of
hilda
his
broken
arm
throbbed
and
he
was
out
of
painkillers
they
have
painkillers
here
candice
went
away
and
then
a
while
later
she
came
back
stay
here
she
said
i
come
and
get
you
in
the
morning
thanks
he
said
then
he
thought
that
he
should
say
something
more
and
he
turned
around
but
the
lawyer
had
gone
he
fell
asleep
holding
hilda
hand
with
his
good
hand
and
woke
up
with
an
unbelievable
pain
in
his
broken
arm
and
could
find
a
nurse
he
bit
down
on
the
pain
and
spent
a
long
watch
that
night
staring
at
hilda
thinking
of
all
she
meant
to
him
and
how
weird
it
was
that
she
meant
so
much
when
they
had
so
brief
a
moment
together
they
had
let
him
bring
his
phone
in
or
he
have
taken
a
thousand
pictures
of
her
face
in
repose
he
nodded
off
again
he
woke
when
she
did
stirring
in
her
bed
her
movements
were
still
weak
and
feeble
but
they
lacked
the
uncontrolled
tremors
of
the
night
before
he
leaned
in
for
a
kiss
not
caring
about
his
sour
breath
or
hers
good
morning
he
said
morning
gorgeous
she
said
and
took
him
in
a
soft
sleepy
hug
candice
sprung
them
and
took
them
across
town
to
her
doctor
a
young
man
who
took
great
care
in
examining
hilda
explaining
patiently
which
fluids
he
was
drawing
and
which
tests
he
planned
on
running
on
them
perry
had
noticed
that
midwesterners
came
in
two
flavors
big
scandinavian
aryans
with
giant
shoulders
and
easy
smiles
and
exchange
students
and
immigrants
in
varying
shades
of
brown
who
looked
hurt
and
bent
alongside
of
the
natives
looked
like
the
people
he
knew
from
back
home
people
who
did
have
ready
access
to
medical
care
or
good
nutrition
in
their
formative
years
the
doctor
was
vietnamese
but
he
was
at
least
a
couple
generations
in
judging
by
his
accent
and
he
had
the
same
midwestern
smile
and
seemed
big
and
bulky
compared
with
the
vietnamese
people
perry
knew
in
florida
he
watched
the
man
peer
intently
at
a
screen
after
taping
some
electrodes
to
hilda
head
and
felt
like
he
come
to
some
land
of
norse
giants
the
doctor
eventually
told
hilda
to
go
home
and
rest
and
she
promised
she
would
perry
and
she
got
into
the
back
of
candice
car
and
cuddled
up
to
one
another
dozing
it
was
until
perry
got
back
with
her
to
her
apartment
every
stick
of
furniture
made
from
clever
cardboard
and
emptied
out
his
pockets
that
he
remembered
to
switch
his
phone
on
again
he
was
down
to
his
boxers
and
she
was
in
cotton
pjs
with
sexy
cowgirls
printed
on
them
and
when
he
powered
the
phone
up
it
went
bonkers
lighting
up
like
a
christmas
tree
vibrating
and
making
urgent
bleats
shit
he
said
and
began
to
sort
through
the
alerts
while
his
back
and
neck
muscles
tightened
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
prodded
at
the
phone
with
his
right
hand
holding
it
awkwardly
in
his
left
hand
trying
to
work
around
the
cast
hilda
took
the
phone
and
held
it
for
him
so
he
could
work
more
freely
and
they
both
read
what
was
going
on
a
second
round
of
lawsuits
had
been
filed
that
night
and
the
injunctions
had
been
reinstated
the
story
about
the
rides
being
a
source
of
printed
arms
and
munitions
had
spread
and
in
san
francisco
the
ride
had
been
taken
apart
by
homeland
security
bomb
robots
that
had
detonated
several
key
pieces
of
equipment
three
of
the
san
francisco
ended
up
in
the
hospital
after
clashes
with
overreacting
cops
hilda
nodded
and
took
the
phone
from
him
and
set
it
down
right
what
the
how
should
i
know
perry
said
he
could
hear
the
whine
in
his
voice
i
just
build
stuff
tjan
and
candice
say
that
they
think
we
can
sue
the
cops
over
the
brutality
and
use
the
money
to
fund
legal
defenses
but
disney
attacking
us
in
the
courtroom
they
also
getting
all
this
destruction
dealt
to
us
by
the
cops
you
know
how
you
eat
an
elephant
one
bite
at
a
time
let
break
this
down
into
small
component
pieces
and
work
on
solutions
to
them
then
call
up
the
troops
and
let
them
know
what
going
on
i
get
a
conference
call
set
up
while
we
chat
she
was
still
moving
slowly
and
weakly
and
he
tried
to
get
her
to
put
down
her
laptop
and
rest
but
she
was
having
any
of
it
and
so
they
worked
dividing
the
problem
up
into
manageable
pieces
incorporating
a
nonprofit
writing
the
getting
the
word
out
through
the
press
the
rides
putting
together
scrapbooks
of
the
carnage
wrought
it
all
seemed
once
it
was
reduced
to
its
component
parts
perry
put
it
all
online
and
then
conferenced
tjan
and
kettlewell
in
perry
do
you
think
it
a
good
idea
to
tell
our
enemies
how
we
plan
to
respond
to
them
hilda
shook
her
head
and
put
a
hand
on
perry
good
arm
to
calm
him
down
before
he
answered
kettlewell
that
how
we
do
it
over
on
our
side
their
side
is
all
about
secrecy
our
side
trades
the
advantage
of
surprise
for
the
advantage
of
openness
you
watch
by
tonight
we
have
drafted
exhaustive
documentation
you
watch
on
the
screen
lester
face
suddenly
hove
into
view
distorted
by
his
proximity
to
the
lens
hilda
gave
an
amused
squeak
and
pulled
back
so
that
yoko
huh
lester
said
grinning
cute
listen
guys
do
let
these
suits
talk
you
out
of
what
you
doing
this
is
the
right
thing
i
on
all
the
message
boards
and
stuff
and
they
all
champing
to
do
something
for
real
yoko
hilda
said
she
raised
an
adorable
eyebrow
just
a
figure
of
speech
lester
said
i
lester
you
must
be
hilda
perry
told
us
practically
nothing
about
you
which
is
probably
a
sign
of
something
or
other
hilda
regarded
perry
with
mock
coolness
oh
really
lester
perry
said
i
love
you
like
a
brother
shut
the
fuck
up
already
lester
made
a
little
whipping
motion
suddenly
he
was
gone
from
the
picture
and
they
saw
suzanne
pulling
him
away
by
one
ear
hilda
snorted
i
like
her
she
said
suzanne
gave
them
a
wave
and
tjan
and
kettlewell
came
back
into
frame
they
made
their
goodbyes
and
hung
up
now
hilda
and
perry
were
alone
together
in
her
bedroom
laptops
shut
day
done
though
it
was
hardly
gone
noon
and
the
silence
stretched
thanks
for
coming
perry
she
said
i
he
broke
off
he
did
know
what
to
say
they
had
only
known
each
other
for
a
day
only
had
a
stand
she
probably
thought
that
he
was
a
giant
creep
i
was
worried
he
said
um
you
should
probably
rest
up
some
more
right
he
got
up
and
headed
for
the
door
where
do
you
think
you
going
she
said
figured
i
let
you
rest
he
said
with
a
get
in
this
bed
this
instant
young
man
she
said
slapping
the
bed
beside
her
and
get
those
stinky
clothes
off
before
you
do
i
have
you
getting
my
sheets
all
covered
in
your
he
felt
the
foolish
grin
spread
across
his
face
and
he
skinned
out
of
his
clothes
as
fast
as
he
could
with
his
cast
on
they
did
leave
the
house
until
suppertime
freshly
showered
been
a
delightful
help
in
scrubbing
those
spots
where
the
cast
impeded
access
and
changed
perry
took
a
painkiller
after
the
shower
which
kicked
in
as
they
went
out
the
door
and
the
autumn
evening
was
crisp
and
sharp
they
got
as
far
as
the
corner
before
the
man
approached
them
perry
gibbons
is
it
he
had
an
english
accent
and
a
little
and
a
big
white
and
a
scarf
wound
round
his
throat
that
right
perry
said
he
looked
at
the
guy
do
i
know
you
no
i
do
think
so
but
i
followed
you
in
the
press
quite
remarkable
thanks
perry
said
being
recognized
how
weird
was
that
cool
that
it
happened
in
front
of
hilda
this
is
hilda
he
said
she
took
the
man
hand
and
he
grinned
showing
two
long
front
teeth
fred
he
said
what
an
absolute
delight
running
into
you
out
here
of
all
places
what
are
you
doing
in
town
just
visiting
with
friends
perry
said
was
there
some
kind
of
at
your
place
in
florida
i
saw
what
they
did
to
the
ride
here
what
a
bloody
mess
yeah
perry
said
he
pointed
at
his
casted
arm
seemed
like
a
good
time
to
get
out
of
dodge
hilda
said
we
getting
some
dinner
if
you
like
to
come
along
i
would
want
to
intrude
no
it
no
sweat
we
got
a
whole
bunch
of
people
associated
with
the
ride
meeting
us
you
be
more
than
welcome
goodness
that
hospitable
of
you
how
can
i
refuse
luke
and
ernie
were
there
with
their
girlfriends
and
there
were
more
kids
midwestern
and
healthy
even
if
they
were
necessarily
all
scandic
some
vietnamese
kids
some
hmong
some
desis
descended
from
the
diaspora
they
had
a
gigantic
meal
in
a
student
place
that
was
heavy
on
the
potatoes
and
beers
the
size
of
your
head
which
perry
resisted
for
a
couple
hours
until
he
figured
that
he
metabolized
most
of
the
painkiller
and
then
started
in
getting
just
short
of
roaring
drunk
he
told
them
war
stories
told
them
about
death
waits
told
them
about
the
and
the
plan
to
fight
back
that
just
does
sound
right
to
me
said
a
friend
of
luke
a
grad
student
who
had
been
bending
perry
ear
all
night
with
stories
from
his
work
defending
university
students
from
lawsuits
i
mean
sure
go
after
the
cops
because
they
roughed
you
guys
up
but
how
much
money
do
the
cops
have
you
got
ta
target
some
fat
cash
and
for
that
you
want
to
go
after
disney
abuse
of
trademark
abuse
of
process
something
like
that
the
standard
pretty
high
but
if
you
can
get
a
judgement
the
money
is
incredible
you
could
take
them
to
the
cleaners
perry
looked
blearily
at
him
he
was
young
like
all
of
them
but
he
had
a
good
rhetorical
style
that
perry
recognized
as
something
born
of
real
confidence
he
knew
his
stuff
or
thought
he
did
he
had
a
strawberry
mark
on
his
high
forehead
that
looked
like
a
map
of
a
distant
island
and
perry
thought
that
the
mark
probably
threw
off
the
kid
opponents
so
we
sue
disney
and
five
years
from
now
we
cash
in
how
does
that
help
us
now
the
kid
nodded
i
hoped
you
ask
me
that
i
been
thinking
about
this
a
lot
lately
here
what
you
need
to
do
dude
here
the
fucking
thing
the
room
had
grown
silent
everyone
leaned
closer
fred
poured
perry
another
beer
from
the
pitcher
in
the
middle
of
the
table
here
how
you
do
it
you
raise
investment
capital
for
it
there
a
ton
of
money
in
this
a
ton
disney
got
deep
pockets
and
you
got
a
great
case
but
like
you
say
it
take
ten
fifteen
years
to
get
the
money
out
of
them
and
it
cost
a
mil
in
legal
fees
on
the
way
so
what
you
do
is
you
create
an
investment
syndicate
you
can
maybe
get
thirty
million
out
of
disney
plus
whatever
the
jury
awards
in
punitives
and
if
you
keep
half
of
it
you
can
deliver
a
return
on
investment
so
go
find
a
millionaire
and
borrow
sixteen
million
and
turn
the
defense
over
to
him
perry
was
dumbstruck
you
joking
how
can
that
possibly
work
it
how
patent
lawsuits
work
some
dickhead
engineer
gets
a
bogus
patent
for
his
doomed
startup
and
as
they
sinking
into
the
mud
some
venture
capitalist
comes
and
buys
the
company
up
just
so
it
can
go
around
and
threaten
other
companies
with
real
businesses
for
violating
the
patent
they
ask
for
sums
just
below
what
it
would
cost
to
get
the
us
patent
and
trademark
office
to
invalidate
the
patent
and
everyone
ponies
up
venture
capitalism
is
the
major
source
of
funding
for
commercial
lawsuits
these
days
fred
laughed
and
clapped
brilliant
perry
that
just
brilliant
are
you
going
to
do
it
perry
looked
at
the
table
doodling
in
the
puddles
of
beer
with
a
fingertip
i
just
want
to
get
back
to
making
stuff
you
know
this
is
nuts
devoting
ten
years
of
my
life
to
suing
someone
you
do
have
to
do
the
suing
that
the
point
you
outsource
that
you
get
the
money
someone
else
does
the
business
stuff
hilda
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulders
give
the
suits
something
to
occupy
themselves
with
otherwise
they
get
antsy
and
stir
up
trouble
perry
and
hilda
laughed
like
it
was
the
funniest
thing
they
ever
heard
fred
and
the
others
joined
in
and
perry
scrawled
a
drunken
note
to
tjan
and
kettlewell
with
the
info
the
party
broke
up
not
long
after
amid
much
chortling
and
snorting
and
they
staggered
home
fred
gave
perry
a
warm
handshake
and
treated
hilda
to
a
lingering
sloppy
hug
until
she
pushed
him
off
laughing
even
harder
all
right
then
perry
said
home
again
home
again
hilda
gave
his
groin
a
friendly
honk
and
then
made
a
dash
for
it
and
he
gave
chase
photo
a
drunken
perry
gibbons
gets
a
how
your
father
from
hilda
hammersen
madison
wi
say
you
managed
to
inspire
some
kind
of
movement
of
who
built
a
network
of
amusement
park
rides
that
guide
their
visitors
through
an
illustrated
history
of
the
last
dotcom
bubble
say
that
your
merry
band
of
unwashed
polyamorous
was
overtaken
by
jackbooted
thugs
from
one
of
the
dinosauric
media
empires
of
yesteryear
whose
legal
machinations
resulted
in
nationwide
raids
beatings
gassings
and
the
total
shutdown
of
your
movement
what
would
you
do
sue
call
a
bail
your
loyal
followers
out
of
the
slam
get
laid
get
shitfaced
and
let
a
bunch
of
students
spitball
bullshit
ideas
for
fighting
back
if
you
picked
the
latter
you
in
good
company
last
night
perry
gibbons
founder
of
the
rideafarian
religious
cult
was
spotted
out
for
drinks
and
cuddles
with
a
group
of
twentysomething
students
in
the
backwater
town
of
madison
wi
a
place
better
known
for
its
cheddar
than
its
activism
while
gibbons
regaled
the
impressionable
with
tales
of
his
he
avidly
noted
their
strategic
suggestions
for
solving
his
legal
paramilitary
and
technical
problems
one
suggestion
that
drew
gibbons
attention
and
admiration
was
to
approach
venture
capitalists
and
beg
them
for
the
capital
to
sue
disney
and
then
use
the
settlements
from
the
suits
to
pay
back
the
vcs
this
ponzi
scheme
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
business
model
we
yet
heard
of
from
the
of
the
new
work
and
its
incarnation
one
can
only
imagine
how
our
ms
church
will
cover
this
in
her
breathless
admiration
for
mr
gibbons
cunning
in
soliciting
yet
more
way
out
of
the
box
thinking
from
the
junior
guevaras
of
the
great
midwest
no
doubt
perhaps
gibbons
can
be
afforded
a
little
sympathy
though
his
latest
encounter
with
florida
law
left
him
with
a
broken
arm
and
it
may
be
that
the
pain
medication
is
primarily
responsible
for
gibbons
fancy
thinking
if
that
the
case
we
can
only
hope
that
his
young
blond
scandie
nursie
will
carefully
minister
him
back
to
health
while
his
comrades
rot
in
gaol
around
the
country
this
organization
needs
to
die
before
it
gets
someone
killed
comments
write
to
freddy
at
honestfred
lester
interrupted
suzanne
to
break
in
and
announce
that
he
run
freddy
to
ground
the
reporter
had
caught
the
first
flight
from
madison
to
chicago
and
then
gone
west
to
san
jose
the
tsa
had
flagged
him
as
a
and
were
watching
his
movements
and
a
little
digging
on
its
website
could
cause
it
to
disclose
freddy
every
airborne
movement
suzanne
relayed
this
to
perry
do
you
go
there
she
said
he
gunning
for
the
san
francisco
crew
and
he
hoping
for
a
confrontation
or
a
denunciation
so
that
he
can
print
it
he
gets
idees
fixes
that
he
worries
at
like
a
terrier
going
for
more
bile
is
he
a
psycho
what
the
hell
is
his
beef
with
me
i
think
that
he
thinks
that
technology
has
lived
up
to
its
promise
and
that
we
should
all
be
demanding
better
of
our
tech
so
for
him
that
means
that
anyone
who
actually
technology
is
the
enemy
the
worst
villain
undermining
the
case
for
bringing
tech
up
to
its
true
potential
fuck
that
is
so
twisted
and
given
the
kind
of
vile
crap
he
writes
the
only
readers
he
has
are
who
get
off
on
seeing
people
who
are
actually
creating
stuff
flayed
alive
for
their
failures
they
egg
him
on
ever
see
one
of
his
letters
columns
if
he
changed
to
actual
reportage
telling
the
balanced
stories
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
they
jump
ship
for
some
other
he
a
for
assholes
the
king
of
the
trolls
perry
looked
away
what
do
i
do
you
could
try
to
starve
him
if
you
do
show
your
head
he
report
on
you
except
by
making
stuff
up
and
stuff
gets
boring
even
for
the
kinds
of
losers
who
read
his
stuff
but
i
got
work
to
do
yeah
yeah
you
do
maybe
you
just
got
to
take
your
lumps
every
complex
ecosystem
has
parasites
after
all
maybe
you
just
call
up
san
francisco
and
brief
them
on
what
to
expect
from
this
guy
and
take
it
from
there
once
they
were
off
the
line
lester
came
up
behind
her
and
hugged
her
at
the
waist
squeezing
the
little
there
reminding
her
of
how
long
it
had
been
since
she
made
it
to
yoga
you
think
that
work
maybe
i
been
talking
to
the
journalism
about
writing
a
piece
on
moral
responsibility
and
paid
journalism
and
if
i
can
bang
it
out
this
aft
i
bet
they
publish
it
tomorrow
what
that
going
to
do
well
it
distract
him
from
perry
maybe
it
might
get
his
employer
to
take
a
hard
look
at
what
he
writing
i
mean
that
piece
is
just
lies
mischaracterizations
and
editorial
masquerading
as
reportage
she
put
her
lid
down
and
paced
around
the
condo
looking
at
the
leaves
floating
in
the
pool
it
give
me
some
satisfaction
lester
gave
her
a
hug
and
it
smelled
of
the
old
days
and
the
old
lester
the
giant
lester
it
took
her
back
to
a
simpler
time
when
they
had
to
worry
about
commercial
competition
not
police
raids
she
hugged
him
back
he
was
all
hard
muscle
and
zero
underneath
his
tight
shirt
she
never
dated
anyone
that
fit
not
even
back
in
it
was
a
little
disorienting
and
it
made
her
feel
especially
old
and
saggy
sometimes
though
he
never
seemed
to
notice
speaking
of
which
she
felt
his
erection
pressing
against
her
midriff
and
tried
to
hide
her
grin
gim
me
a
couple
hours
all
right
she
dialed
the
njr
editor
number
as
she
slid
into
her
chair
and
pulled
up
a
she
knew
what
she
planned
on
writing
but
it
would
help
to
be
able
to
share
an
outline
with
the
njr
if
she
was
going
to
get
this
out
in
good
time
working
with
editors
was
a
pain
after
years
of
writing
for
the
blog
but
sometimes
you
wanted
someone
else
imprimatur
on
your
work
five
hours
later
the
copy
was
filed
she
rocked
back
in
her
chair
and
stretched
her
arms
high
over
her
head
listening
to
the
crackle
of
her
spine
she
been
by
the
air
conditioning
so
she
turned
it
off
and
opened
a
window
and
now
the
condo
was
hot
and
muggy
she
stripped
down
to
her
underwear
and
headed
for
the
shower
but
before
she
could
make
it
she
was
intercepted
by
lester
he
fell
on
her
like
a
dog
on
dinner
and
hours
slipped
by
as
they
made
the
apartment
even
muggier
lester
athleticism
in
the
sack
was
flattering
but
sometimes
boundless
to
the
point
of
irritation
she
was
rescued
from
it
this
time
by
the
doorbell
lester
put
on
a
bathrobe
and
answered
the
door
and
she
heard
the
sounds
of
the
family
kettlewell
spilling
in
the
kids
little
footfalls
pounding
up
and
down
the
corridors
hurriedly
suzanne
threw
on
a
robe
and
ducked
across
the
corridor
into
the
bathroom
but
not
before
catching
sight
of
eva
and
landon
eva
expression
was
grimly
satisfied
landon
looked
stricken
fuck
it
anyway
she
never
given
him
any
reason
to
hope
and
he
had
no
business
hoping
halfway
through
her
shower
she
heard
someone
moving
around
in
the
bathroom
and
thinking
it
was
lester
she
stuck
her
head
around
the
curtain
only
to
find
ada
on
the
pot
little
jeans
around
her
ankles
i
hadda
make
ada
said
with
a
shrug
christ
what
was
she
doing
back
here
anyway
she
missed
it
all
so
much
from
petersburg
but
she
had
really
bargained
for
this
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
tjan
showed
up
too
surely
they
be
wanting
a
council
of
war
after
freddy
opening
salvo
she
waited
for
the
little
girl
to
flush
ouch
hot
water
and
got
dressed
as
discreetly
as
possible
by
the
time
she
got
to
the
balcony
where
the
council
of
war
was
under
way
the
two
little
girls
lyenitchka
and
ada
had
gotten
pascal
up
on
the
sofa
and
were
playing
dress
up
with
him
barbie
heads
to
his
cheeks
and
arms
and
chubby
knees
like
vacantly
staring
warts
do
you
like
him
i
think
he
looks
wonderful
girls
is
that
glue
ok
for
him
though
ada
nodded
vigorously
i
been
gluing
things
to
my
brother
with
that
stuff
forever
dad
says
it
ok
so
long
as
i
do
put
it
in
his
eyes
your
dad
a
smart
man
he
in
love
with
you
lyenitchka
said
and
giggled
ada
slugged
her
in
the
arm
that
supposed
to
be
a
secret
stupid
ada
said
flustered
suzanne
ducked
out
onto
the
patio
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
eva
and
tjan
and
kettlewell
all
turned
to
look
at
her
suzanne
tjan
said
nice
article
is
it
up
already
yeah
just
a
couple
minutes
ago
tjan
held
up
his
phone
i
got
a
for
anything
to
do
with
freddy
that
gets
a
lot
of
in
a
short
period
your
piece
rang
the
cherries
she
took
the
phone
from
him
and
looked
at
the
list
of
links
that
had
been
found
to
the
piece
three
of
the
diggdots
had
picked
up
the
story
since
they
loved
to
report
on
anything
that
made
fun
of
freddy
he
was
a
frequent
savager
of
their
readers
cherished
beliefs
after
all
and
thence
it
had
wormed
its
way
all
around
the
net
in
the
time
she
needed
to
take
a
shower
her
story
had
been
read
by
about
three
million
people
she
felt
a
twinge
of
regret
for
not
publishing
it
on
her
blog
that
would
have
been
some
serious
advertising
coin
well
there
you
have
it
what
do
you
suppose
he
come
back
with
kettlewell
said
then
looked
uncomfortably
at
eva
she
pretended
not
to
notice
and
continued
to
stare
at
the
grimy
hollywood
palms
swimming
pools
and
freeways
something
nasty
and
full
of
lies
no
doubt
nerd
groupie
church
finds
fatkins
love
with
ride
sidekick
sources
close
to
the
hollywood
florida
have
revealed
that
suzanne
church
the
celebrity
blogger
who
helped
inflate
the
new
work
stock
bubble
is
in
the
midst
of
a
romantic
entanglement
with
one
of
the
cult
church
recently
came
out
of
retirement
in
st
petersburg
where
she
has
been
producing
journalistic
accounts
of
the
new
generation
of
russian
experimental
plastic
surgery
butchers
church
was
lured
back
by
the
promise
of
a
story
about
the
that
was
founded
by
her
old
pals
from
the
new
work
lester
banks
and
perry
gibbons
now
on
the
scene
are
more
familiar
faces
landon
kettlewell
the
disgraced
former
ceo
of
kodacell
and
tjan
tang
the
former
business
manager
of
the
scam
but
not
long
after
arriving
on
the
scene
church
fell
in
with
banks
an
early
fatkins
and
stalwart
of
the
new
work
movement
a
technologist
who
entranced
his
fellow
engineers
with
his
accounts
of
the
new
many
inventions
prompting
one
commenter
to
characterize
him
as
a
cross
between
steve
wozniak
and
the
reverend
sun
myung
moon
now
eyewitness
accounts
have
them
going
at
it
like
shagging
marmots
as
the
banks
falls
on
church
wrinkly
carcass
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
apparently
consummating
a
romance
that
blossomed
while
banks
was
to
put
it
bluntly
a
giant
fat
bastard
it
seems
that
radical
has
put
banks
into
the
category
of
blokes
that
suzanne
church
is
willing
to
play
hide
the
sausage
with
all
this
would
be
mere
sordid
gossip
but
for
the
fact
that
church
is
once
again
glowingly
chronicling
the
adventures
of
the
florida
cultists
playing
journalist
without
a
shred
of
impartiality
or
disclosure
one
can
only
imagine
when
the
other
financial
shoe
will
drop
for
wherever
church
goes
money
is
far
behind
surely
there
a
financial
aspect
to
this
business
with
the
ride
update
indeed
there
is
further
anonymous
tipsterism
reveals
that
papers
have
been
filed
to
create
a
structured
like
a
classic
ponzi
scheme
in
which
franchise
operators
of
the
ride
are
expected
to
pay
membership
dues
further
up
the
ladder
all
the
romance
of
accounts
will
certainly
find
a
fresh
batch
of
suckers
if
one
thing
we
know
about
suzanne
church
it
that
she
knows
how
to
separate
a
mark
from
his
money
lester
ran
the
ride
basically
on
his
own
that
week
missing
his
workshop
and
his
tinkering
thinking
of
suzanne
wishing
that
perry
was
back
already
he
was
exactly
a
people
person
and
there
were
a
of
people
i
brought
some
stuff
the
goth
kid
said
as
he
paid
for
his
ticket
hefting
two
huge
duffel
bags
that
still
ok
right
was
it
damned
if
lester
knew
the
kid
had
a
huge
bruise
covering
half
of
his
face
and
lester
thought
he
recognized
him
from
the
showdown
death
waits
that
what
perry
had
said
sure
it
fine
you
lester
right
christ
another
one
yes
that
me
honest
fred
is
full
of
shit
i
been
reading
your
posts
since
forever
that
guy
is
just
jealous
because
your
girlfriend
outed
him
for
being
such
a
lying
asshole
yeah
death
waits
was
the
first
one
to
say
words
to
this
effect
suzanne
had
had
that
honor
and
he
would
be
the
last
but
lester
wanted
to
forget
it
he
liked
the
moments
of
fame
he
gained
from
suzanne
writing
from
his
work
on
the
message
boards
he
even
had
a
couple
of
fanboys
show
up
to
do
a
little
interview
for
their
podcast
about
his
mechanical
computer
that
had
been
nice
but
blokes
that
suzanne
church
is
willing
to
play
hide
the
sausage
with
ugh
suzanne
was
holding
it
together
as
far
as
he
could
tell
but
she
did
seem
as
willing
to
stick
her
neck
out
to
broker
little
peaces
between
tjan
and
kettlewell
anymore
and
those
two
were
going
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
now
each
convinced
that
he
was
in
charge
tjan
reasoned
that
since
he
actually
ran
one
of
the
rides
in
the
network
that
he
should
be
the
executive
with
kettlewell
as
a
trusted
adviser
kettlewell
clearly
felt
that
he
deserved
the
crown
because
he
actually
run
global
businesses
as
opposed
to
tjan
who
was
little
more
than
a
middle
manager
neither
had
said
exactly
that
but
that
was
only
because
whenever
they
headed
down
that
path
suzanne
interposed
herself
and
distracted
them
no
one
asked
lester
or
perry
even
though
they
were
the
ones
invented
it
all
it
was
all
so
fucked
up
why
could
he
just
make
stuff
and
do
stuff
why
did
it
always
have
to
turn
into
a
plan
for
world
domination
in
lester
experience
most
plans
went
sour
while
a
hefty
proportion
of
modest
plans
to
make
something
cool
actually
worked
out
pretty
well
paid
the
bills
and
put
food
on
the
table
the
goth
kid
looked
expectantly
at
him
i
a
huge
fan
you
know
i
used
to
work
for
disney
and
i
was
always
watching
what
you
did
to
get
ideas
for
new
stuff
we
should
do
that
why
it
so
totally
suckballs
that
they
accusing
you
of
ripping
them
off
we
rip
you
off
all
the
time
lester
felt
like
he
was
expected
to
do
something
with
that
information
maybe
deliver
it
to
some
lawyer
or
whatever
but
would
it
make
a
difference
he
could
get
any
spit
in
his
mouth
over
legal
fights
christ
legal
fights
thanks
you
death
waits
right
perry
told
me
about
you
the
kid
visibly
swelled
yeah
i
could
help
around
here
if
you
wanted
you
know
i
know
a
lot
about
i
used
to
train
the
at
disney
and
i
could
work
any
position
if
you
wanted
we
not
really
hiring
lester
began
i
not
looking
for
a
job
i
could
just
you
know
help
i
do
have
a
job
or
anything
right
now
lester
needed
to
pee
and
he
was
sick
of
sitting
here
taking
money
and
he
wanted
to
go
play
with
his
mechanical
computer
anyway
lester
who
the
kid
taking
ticket
money
suzanne
hug
was
sweaty
and
smelled
good
look
at
this
lester
said
he
flipped
up
his
magnifying
goggles
and
handed
her
the
soda
can
he
cut
away
a
panel
covering
the
whole
front
of
the
can
and
inside
he
painstakingly
assembled
he
turned
the
crank
on
the
back
of
the
can
slowly
and
the
correct
combination
of
rods
extended
from
the
back
of
the
can
indicating
the
values
represented
on
the
within
it
a
bit
register
we
could
build
a
shitkicking
pentium
out
of
a
couple
million
of
these
he
turned
the
crank
again
the
can
smelled
of
solder
and
it
had
a
pleasant
weight
in
his
hand
the
mill
beside
him
hummed
and
on
his
screen
the
parts
he
cadded
up
rotated
in
wireframe
suzanne
was
at
his
side
and
he
just
built
something
completely
teh
awesome
taken
his
shirt
off
somewhere
along
the
afternoon
lazy
warm
way
and
his
skin
prickled
with
a
breeze
he
turned
to
take
suzanne
in
his
arms
god
he
loved
her
he
been
in
love
with
her
for
years
now
and
she
was
his
look
at
how
cool
this
thing
is
just
look
he
used
a
tweezer
to
change
the
registers
again
and
gave
it
a
little
crank
i
got
the
idea
from
the
old
princeton
institute
electronic
computer
project
all
these
geniuses
von
neumann
and
dyson
they
brought
in
their
kids
for
the
summer
to
wind
all
the
cores
they
need
for
their
ram
millions
of
these
things
wound
by
the
kids
of
the
smartest
people
in
the
universe
what
a
cool
way
to
spend
your
summer
so
i
thought
i
prototype
the
next
generation
of
these
a
version
that
you
could
build
out
of
garbage
get
a
couple
hundred
of
the
local
kids
in
for
the
summer
and
get
them
working
get
them
to
understand
just
how
these
things
work
that
the
problem
with
integrated
circuits
you
ca
take
them
apart
and
see
how
they
work
how
are
we
going
to
get
another
generation
of
tinkerers
unless
we
get
kids
interested
in
how
stuff
works
who
the
kid
taking
ticket
money
he
a
fan
that
kid
that
perry
met
in
jail
death
waits
the
one
who
brought
in
the
disney
stuff
he
gradually
became
aware
that
suzanne
was
rigid
and
shaking
in
his
arms
what
wrong
her
face
was
purple
now
her
hands
clenched
into
fists
what
wrong
lester
what
wrong
you
left
a
total
stranger
who
by
his
own
admission
is
a
recently
terminated
employee
of
a
company
that
is
trying
to
bankrupt
you
and
put
you
in
jail
you
left
him
in
charge
of
an
expensive
important
capital
investment
and
given
him
the
authority
to
collect
money
on
your
behalf
do
you
really
need
to
ask
me
what
wrong
he
tried
to
smile
it
ok
it
ok
he
only
only
what
only
your
possible
doom
christ
perry
you
do
even
have
fucking
on
that
business
did
she
just
call
him
perry
he
carefully
set
down
the
coke
can
and
looked
at
her
i
down
here
busting
my
for
you
two
fighting
cops
letting
that
shit
freddy
smear
my
name
all
over
the
net
and
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
to
save
yourself
you
in
here
playing
with
coke
cans
she
picked
it
up
and
shook
it
he
heard
the
works
inside
rattling
and
flinched
towards
it
she
jerked
it
out
of
his
reach
and
threw
it
hard
at
the
wall
hundreds
of
little
gears
and
ratchets
and
rods
spilled
out
of
it
fine
lester
fine
you
go
on
being
an
emotional
but
stop
roping
other
people
into
this
you
got
people
all
over
the
country
depending
on
you
and
you
are
just
your
responsibility
to
them
i
wo
be
a
part
of
it
she
was
crying
now
lester
had
no
idea
what
to
say
now
it
not
enough
that
perry
off
chasing
pussy
you
got
to
pick
this
moment
to
take
french
leave
to
play
with
your
toys
christ
the
whole
bunch
of
you
deserve
each
other
lester
knew
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
shouting
at
her
really
tearing
into
her
saying
unforgivable
things
he
been
there
before
with
other
friends
and
no
good
ever
came
of
it
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
never
asked
for
the
responsibility
that
he
lived
up
to
it
anyway
that
no
one
had
asked
her
to
put
her
neck
on
the
line
and
it
was
fair
to
blame
him
for
the
shit
that
freddy
was
putting
her
through
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
if
she
was
in
love
with
perry
she
should
be
sleeping
with
perry
and
not
him
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
she
had
no
business
reaming
him
out
for
doing
what
he
always
done
sit
in
his
workshop
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
she
had
never
once
seen
him
as
a
sexual
being
when
he
was
big
and
fat
but
that
he
had
no
trouble
seeing
her
as
one
now
that
she
was
getting
old
and
a
little
saggy
and
so
where
did
she
get
off
criticizing
his
emotional
maturity
he
wanted
to
say
all
of
this
and
he
wanted
to
take
back
his
register
and
nurse
it
back
to
health
he
been
in
a
luminous
creative
fog
when
he
built
that
can
and
who
knew
if
he
be
able
to
reconstruct
it
he
wanted
to
cry
to
blubber
at
her
for
the
monumental
unfairness
of
it
all
he
stood
stiffly
up
from
his
workbench
and
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
out
he
expected
suzanne
to
call
out
to
him
but
she
did
he
did
care
or
at
least
he
did
want
to
sammy
skipped
three
consecutive
meetings
despite
increasingly
desperate
requests
for
his
presence
the
legal
team
was
eating
every
spare
moment
he
had
and
he
had
been
able
to
get
audience
research
to
get
busy
on
his
fatkins
project
now
he
was
behind
schedule
not
surprising
given
that
he
pulled
his
schedule
out
of
his
ass
to
shut
up
wiener
and
co
and
dealing
with
lawyers
was
making
him
crazy
and
to
top
it
all
off
the
goddamned
rides
were
back
up
and
running
so
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
a
visit
from
wiener
they
suing
us
you
know
they
raised
to
sue
us
because
we
have
such
deep
pockets
you
know
that
sammy
i
know
it
wiener
people
sue
us
all
the
time
venture
capitalists
have
deep
pockets
too
you
know
when
we
win
we
take
them
to
the
cleaners
christ
why
am
i
having
this
conversation
with
you
do
you
have
something
productive
to
do
is
tomorrowland
so
fucking
that
you
come
around
to
help
me
with
my
little
projects
someone
a
little
touchy
today
wiener
said
wagging
a
finger
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
wanted
some
help
coming
up
with
a
strategy
for
getting
out
of
this
catastrophe
but
since
you
mention
it
i
have
work
i
could
be
doing
i
see
you
at
the
next
meeting
sam
missing
three
is
grounds
for
disciplinary
action
you
know
sammy
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
coolly
at
wiener
threats
now
disciplinary
action
he
kept
on
his
best
poker
face
looking
past
wiener
shoulder
a
favorite
trick
for
staring
down
adversaries
just
do
meet
their
eyes
in
his
peripheral
vision
he
saw
wiener
wilt
look
away
and
then
turn
and
leave
the
room
he
waited
until
the
door
had
shut
then
slumped
in
his
seat
and
put
his
face
in
his
hands
god
and
shit
and
damn
how
did
it
all
go
so
crapola
how
did
he
end
up
with
a
that
was
record
absenteeism
and
even
a
goddamned
just
the
day
before
whom
he
had
to
have
security
remove
florida
laws
being
what
they
were
it
was
a
rare
organizer
brave
enough
to
try
to
come
on
an
employer
actual
premises
to
do
his
dirty
work
no
one
wanted
a
rap
without
parole
for
criminal
trespass
and
interference
with
trade
the
kid
had
been
young
about
the
same
age
as
death
waits
and
the
castmembers
and
had
clearly
been
desperate
to
collect
his
bounty
from
seiu
he
gone
hard
struggling
and
kicking
shouting
slogans
at
the
castmembers
and
few
guests
who
watched
him
go
away
having
him
taken
away
had
given
sammy
a
sick
feeling
they
had
had
one
of
those
vultures
on
the
premises
in
three
years
and
never
on
sammy
turf
what
next
what
next
how
much
worse
could
it
get
hi
sammy
hackelberg
was
the
head
of
the
legal
department
but
he
was
as
high
up
in
the
shadowy
organization
as
sammy
ever
hoped
to
meet
he
was
old
and
leathery
the
way
that
natives
to
the
sunbelt
could
be
he
loved
to
affect
suits
and
had
even
been
known
to
carry
a
cane
when
he
was
in
casual
conversation
he
talked
normal
like
a
yankee
newscaster
but
the
more
serious
he
got
the
deeper
and
thicker
his
drawl
got
sammy
never
once
believed
that
this
was
accidental
hackelberg
was
as
premeditated
as
they
came
i
was
just
about
to
come
over
and
see
you
sammy
lied
whatever
problem
had
brought
hackelberg
down
to
his
office
it
would
be
better
to
seem
as
though
he
was
already
on
top
of
it
i
expect
you
were
came
out
when
the
drawl
got
that
far
into
the
swamps
that
quickly
disaster
was
on
the
horizon
hackelberg
let
the
phrase
hang
there
sammy
sweated
he
was
good
at
this
game
but
hackelberg
was
better
entertainment
lawyers
were
like
fucking
vampires
evil
embodied
he
looked
down
at
his
desk
sammy
they
coming
back
after
us
comin
back
those
ride
people
they
did
what
we
thought
they
do
incorporating
into
a
single
entity
that
we
can
sue
once
and
kill
for
good
but
then
they
did
something
else
do
you
know
what
they
did
sammy
sammy
nodded
they
countersuing
we
knew
they
do
that
right
we
did
expect
they
raise
a
like
the
one
they
pulled
together
they
have
a
built
around
suing
us
for
the
next
fifteen
years
sammy
they
practically
ready
to
float
an
ipo
have
you
seen
this
he
handed
sammy
a
hardcopy
of
a
chic
little
investment
newsletter
that
was
so
expensive
to
subscribe
to
that
suspected
until
now
that
it
might
just
be
a
rumor
how
do
you
get
rid
e
of
a
billion
the
kodacell
experiment
recognized
one
fundamental
truth
it
easy
to
turn
ten
thousand
into
two
hundred
thousand
but
much
harder
to
turn
ten
million
into
two
hundred
million
scaling
an
investment
up
to
gigascale
is
so
hard
it
nearly
impossible
but
a
new
paradigm
in
investment
that
unfolding
around
us
that
might
actually
solve
the
problem
litigation
twenty
or
thirty
million
sunk
into
litigation
can
bankrupt
a
twenty
firm
transferring
to
the
investors
whatever
assets
remain
after
legal
fees
it
sounds
crazy
and
only
time
will
tell
whether
it
proves
to
be
sustainable
but
the
founder
of
the
strategy
landon
kettlewell
has
struck
gold
for
his
investors
more
than
once
witness
the
legendary
rise
and
fall
of
kodacell
the
entity
that
emerged
from
the
merger
of
kodak
and
duracell
investors
in
the
first
two
rounds
and
the
ipo
on
kodacell
brought
home
returns
in
three
years
of
course
investors
who
stayed
in
too
long
came
away
with
nothing
meanwhile
kettlewell
bid
to
take
down
disney
parks
looks
good
the
legal
analysis
of
the
vexatious
litigation
and
unfair
competition
charges
have
legal
scholars
arguing
and
adding
up
the
zeros
most
damning
is
the
number
of
former
disney
parks
employees
or
castmembers
in
the
treacly
dialect
of
the
magic
kingdom
posted
information
about
the
company
plan
to
sabotage
kettlewell
clients
likewise
fascinating
is
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
will
be
able
to
distinguish
between
disney
parks
whose
corporate
citizenship
is
actually
pretty
good
from
disney
products
whose
record
has
been
tainted
by
a
string
of
disastrous
safety
and
design
flaws
astute
readers
will
be
thinking
of
the
flammable
pajamas
flap
of
last
year
and
ceo
robert
montague
memorable
words
parents
who
ca
keep
their
kids
away
from
matches
have
no
business
complaining
about
irresponsibility
punitive
jury
awards
are
a
in
this
kind
of
litigation
but
given
the
trends
in
recent
years
things
look
bad
for
disney
parks
bottom
line
should
your
portfolio
include
a
component
yes
unequivocally
while
risky
and
slow
to
mature
promise
a
staggering
return
on
investment
not
seen
in
decades
a
million
or
two
carefully
placed
with
the
right
litigation
fund
could
pay
off
enough
to
make
it
all
worthwhile
this
is
creative
destruction
at
its
finest
the
old
dinosaurs
like
disney
parks
are
like
rich
seams
of
capital
begging
to
be
liquidated
and
put
to
work
at
nimbler
firms
how
can
you
tell
if
you
got
the
right
fund
come
back
next
week
when
we
have
a
q
a
with
a
litigation
specialist
at
credit
boston
there
litigation
specialists
at
credit
suisse
he
was
big
hackelberg
though
he
often
gave
the
impression
of
being
smaller
through
his
habitual
slouch
but
when
he
pulled
himself
up
it
was
like
a
string
in
the
center
of
the
top
of
his
head
was
holding
him
erect
like
he
was
hovering
off
the
ground
like
he
was
about
to
leap
across
the
desk
and
go
for
your
throat
his
lower
jaw
rocked
from
side
to
side
they
do
now
sammy
every
investment
bank
has
one
including
the
one
that
the
chairman
of
our
board
is
a
majority
shareholder
in
sammy
swallowed
but
they
got
just
as
deep
pockets
as
we
do
ca
we
just
fight
these
battles
out
and
take
the
money
off
of
them
when
we
win
if
we
win
sammy
saw
his
opportunity
to
shift
the
blame
if
we
been
acting
on
good
legal
advice
why
would
we
win
hackelberg
inhaled
slowly
his
chest
filling
and
filling
until
his
suit
looked
like
it
might
pop
his
jaw
clicked
from
side
to
side
but
he
did
say
anything
sammy
tried
to
meet
that
cool
gaze
but
he
could
the
man
the
silence
stretched
sammy
got
the
message
this
was
not
a
problem
that
originated
in
the
legal
department
this
was
a
problem
that
originated
with
him
he
looked
away
how
do
we
solve
this
we
need
to
raise
the
cost
of
litigation
samuel
the
only
reason
this
is
viable
is
that
it
to
sue
us
when
we
raise
the
cost
of
litigation
we
reduce
its
profitability
how
do
we
raise
the
cost
of
litigation
you
have
a
fertile
imagination
sammy
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
be
able
to
conceive
of
innumerable
means
of
accomplishing
this
goal
i
see
i
hope
you
do
i
really
hope
you
do
because
we
have
an
alternative
to
raising
the
cost
of
litigation
yes
we
could
sacrifice
an
employee
or
two
sammy
picked
up
his
and
discovered
that
it
was
empty
he
turned
away
from
his
desk
to
refill
it
from
his
filter
and
when
he
turned
back
the
lawyer
had
gone
his
mouth
was
dry
as
cotton
and
his
hands
were
shaking
raise
the
cost
of
litigation
huh
he
grabbed
his
laptop
there
were
ways
to
establish
anonymous
email
accounts
but
he
did
know
them
figuring
that
out
would
take
up
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
realized
as
he
called
up
a
couple
of
faqs
in
the
course
of
a
career
as
varied
and
ambitious
as
sammy
it
was
often
the
case
that
you
ran
across
an
email
address
for
someone
you
never
planned
on
contacting
but
you
never
knew
and
a
wise
planner
makes
space
for
lots
of
outlier
contingencies
sammy
had
written
down
these
email
addresses
he
committed
them
to
memory
death
waits
was
living
the
dream
he
took
people
money
and
directed
them
to
the
ride
entrance
making
them
feel
welcome
talking
ride
trivia
some
of
his
pals
spotted
him
at
the
desk
and
enviously
demanded
to
know
how
he
came
to
be
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
wicket
and
he
told
them
the
incredible
story
of
the
fatkins
simply
handed
over
the
reins
this
this
was
how
you
ran
a
ride
none
of
that
artificial
gloopy
sweetness
that
defined
the
disney
experience
instead
you
got
a
personal
informal
experience
chat
people
up
find
out
their
hopes
and
dreams
make
admiring
noises
at
the
artifacts
brought
to
add
to
the
ride
kibbitz
about
where
they
might
place
them
around
him
the
bark
of
the
vendors
one
of
them
an
old
lady
in
a
blinding
white
came
by
to
ask
him
if
he
wanted
anything
from
the
there
had
been
a
time
those
first
days
when
they
rebuilt
fantasyland
when
he
really
felt
like
he
was
part
of
the
magic
no
the
magic
with
capital
letters
something
about
the
shared
experience
of
going
to
a
place
with
people
and
having
an
experience
with
them
that
was
special
it
must
be
why
people
went
to
church
not
that
disney
had
been
a
religion
for
him
exactly
but
when
he
watched
the
park
he
grown
up
attending
take
on
the
trappings
that
adorned
his
favorite
clubs
his
favorite
movies
and
games
man
it
had
been
a
piece
of
magic
and
to
be
a
part
of
it
to
be
an
altar
boy
if
not
a
priest
in
that
magical
cathedral
they
all
built
together
in
orlando
but
it
had
been
real
he
could
see
that
now
at
disney
death
waits
had
been
a
customer
and
then
an
employee
castmember
he
corrected
himself
reflexively
what
he
wanted
though
was
to
be
a
a
citizen
of
the
magic
which
a
magic
kingdom
since
kingdoms
did
have
citizens
they
had
subjects
he
started
to
worry
about
whether
he
was
going
to
get
a
lunch
break
by
about
two
and
by
three
he
was
starving
luckily
that
when
lester
came
back
he
thanked
death
profusely
which
was
nice
but
he
ask
death
to
come
back
the
next
day
um
when
can
i
come
back
and
do
this
some
more
you
to
do
this
i
told
you
that
this
morning
i
love
it
i
good
at
it
too
lester
appeared
to
think
it
over
i
do
know
man
i
kind
of
put
you
in
the
today
but
i
do
really
have
the
authority
to
do
it
i
could
get
into
trouble
death
waved
him
off
do
sweat
it
then
he
said
with
as
much
chirp
as
he
could
muster
which
was
precious
fucking
little
he
felt
like
his
heart
was
breaking
it
was
worse
than
when
he
finally
asked
out
a
who
worked
the
pinocchio
village
haus
and
she
had
her
looked
so
horrified
that
he
made
a
joke
out
of
it
worried
about
a
sexual
harassment
complaint
lester
clearly
caught
some
of
that
for
he
thought
some
more
and
then
waved
his
hands
screw
her
anyway
meet
me
here
at
ten
tomorrow
you
in
death
was
sure
he
heard
him
right
you
kidding
no
man
you
want
it
you
got
it
you
good
at
it
like
you
said
holy
thanks
thank
you
so
much
i
mean
it
thank
you
he
made
himself
stop
blithering
nice
to
meet
you
he
said
finally
have
a
great
evening
yowch
he
was
speaking
castmemberese
one
he
saved
enough
out
of
his
wages
from
his
first
year
at
disney
to
buy
a
little
shell
electric
and
then
he
gone
way
into
debt
buying
kits
to
mod
it
to
look
like
a
big
daddy
roth
the
car
sat
alone
at
the
edge
of
the
lot
around
him
a
slow
procession
of
with
their
arms
full
headed
for
the
freeway
and
across
to
the
shantytown
meanwhile
he
nursed
his
embarrassment
and
tried
to
take
comfort
in
the
attention
that
his
gleaming
modded
car
evinced
he
loved
the
decorative
spoilers
the
huge
rear
tires
the
shining
running
alongside
the
bulging
he
stepped
in
and
gripped
the
gearshift
adjusted
the
headrest
and
got
rolling
it
was
a
long
drive
back
home
to
melbourne
and
he
was
reeling
from
the
day
events
he
wished
he
gotten
someone
to
snap
a
pic
of
him
at
the
counter
shit
he
pulled
off
at
a
filling
station
after
a
couple
hours
he
needed
a
piss
and
something
with
guarana
if
he
was
going
to
make
it
the
rest
of
the
way
home
it
was
all
shut
down
but
the
automat
was
still
open
he
stood
before
the
giant
refrigerator
and
dithered
over
the
there
were
chocolate
ones
salty
ones
colas
and
cream
sodas
but
a
friend
had
texted
him
a
picture
of
a
yogurt
smoothie
with
taurine
and
modafinil
that
sounded
really
good
he
spotted
it
and
reached
to
tap
on
the
glass
and
order
it
just
as
the
fat
guy
came
up
beside
him
fat
guys
were
rare
in
the
era
of
fatkins
it
was
practically
a
to
be
chunky
but
this
guy
was
fashionable
he
had
that
death
could
smell
even
before
he
opened
his
mouth
and
he
was
wearing
a
greasy
windbreaker
and
baggy
jeans
he
had
a
and
needed
a
shave
what
the
hell
are
you
supposed
to
be
i
not
anything
death
waits
said
he
was
used
to
and
tourists
gawping
at
his
shock
of
black
hair
with
its
viridian
green
highlights
his
white
and
eyeliner
his
contact
lenses
that
made
his
whole
eyes
into
you
just
had
to
ignore
them
you
do
look
like
nothing
to
me
you
look
like
something
something
you
dress
up
a
six
year
old
as
for
halloween
i
mean
what
the
fuck
he
was
talking
quietly
and
without
rancor
but
he
had
a
vibe
like
a
basher
he
must
have
arrived
at
the
deserted
while
death
waits
was
having
a
piss
death
waits
looked
around
for
a
security
cam
these
always
had
a
cam
at
the
entrance
and
a
couple
of
cams
around
the
cashier
he
spotted
the
camera
someone
had
hung
a
baseball
hat
over
its
lens
he
felt
his
balls
draw
up
toward
his
abdomen
and
his
breathing
quicken
this
guy
was
going
to
fucking
mug
him
shit
shit
shit
maybe
take
his
ok
death
said
nice
talking
to
you
he
tried
to
step
around
the
guy
but
he
to
block
death
path
then
put
a
hand
on
death
shoulder
it
was
strong
death
had
been
mugged
once
before
but
the
guy
had
touched
him
he
just
told
him
fast
and
mean
to
hand
over
his
wallet
and
phone
and
then
had
split
i
not
done
the
guy
said
look
take
my
wallet
i
do
want
any
trouble
apart
from
two
glorious
at
sammy
death
had
never
thrown
a
punch
not
since
he
flunked
out
of
karate
lessons
at
the
local
when
he
was
twelve
he
liked
to
dance
and
he
could
run
a
couple
miles
without
getting
winded
but
he
seen
enough
real
fights
to
know
that
it
was
better
to
get
away
than
to
try
to
strike
out
if
you
did
know
what
you
were
doing
you
do
want
any
trouble
huh
death
held
out
his
wallet
he
could
cancel
the
cards
losing
the
cash
would
hurt
now
that
he
did
have
a
but
it
was
better
than
losing
his
teeth
the
guy
smiled
his
onion
breath
was
terrible
want
trouble
without
any
or
the
guy
took
hold
of
the
earring
that
death
wore
in
his
tragus
the
little
knob
of
cartilage
on
the
inside
of
his
ear
and
briskly
tore
it
out
of
head
it
was
so
sudden
the
pain
did
come
at
once
what
came
first
was
a
numb
feeling
the
blood
draining
out
of
his
cheeks
and
the
color
draining
out
of
the
world
and
his
brain
and
what
had
just
happened
someone
just
tear
a
piece
out
of
my
ear
tear
ear
then
the
pain
roared
in
all
of
his
senses
leaping
to
keen
awareness
before
maxing
out
completely
he
heard
a
crashing
sound
like
the
surf
smelled
something
burning
a
light
appeared
before
his
eyes
an
acrid
taste
flooded
his
mouth
and
his
ear
felt
like
there
was
a
hot
coal
nestled
in
it
charring
the
flesh
with
pain
came
the
plan
the
fuck
out
of
he
took
a
step
back
and
turned
to
run
but
there
was
something
tangled
in
his
feet
the
guy
had
bridged
the
distance
between
them
quickly
very
quickly
and
had
hooked
a
foot
around
his
ankle
he
was
going
to
fall
over
he
landed
in
a
runner
crouch
and
tried
to
start
running
but
a
boot
caught
him
in
the
butt
like
an
comedy
moment
and
he
went
sprawling
his
chin
smacking
into
the
pavement
his
teeth
clacking
together
with
a
sound
that
echoed
in
his
head
get
the
fuck
up
the
guy
said
he
was
panting
a
little
sounding
excited
that
sound
was
the
scariest
thing
so
far
this
guy
wanted
to
kill
him
he
could
hear
that
he
was
some
kind
of
murderer
death
fingers
were
encrusted
in
heavy
silver
rings
stylized
skulls
a
staring
eyeball
a
poisoner
ring
that
he
sometimes
kept
artificial
sweetener
in
an
ankh
an
alien
head
with
insectile
eyes
and
he
balled
his
hands
into
fists
thinking
of
everything
he
ever
read
about
throwing
a
punch
without
breaking
your
knuckles
close
keep
your
fist
tight
thumb
outside
do
wind
up
or
he
see
it
coming
he
slowly
turned
over
the
guy
eyes
were
in
shadow
his
belly
heaved
with
each
excited
pant
from
this
angle
death
could
see
the
guy
had
a
gigantic
boner
the
thought
of
what
that
might
bode
sent
him
into
overdrive
he
could
afford
to
let
this
guy
beat
him
up
he
backed
up
to
the
rail
that
lined
the
walkway
and
pulled
himself
upright
he
cowered
in
on
himself
as
much
as
he
could
hoping
that
the
guy
would
close
with
him
so
he
could
get
in
one
good
punch
he
muttered
indistinctly
softly
hoping
to
make
the
man
lean
in
his
hands
gripped
the
railings
the
guy
took
a
step
toward
him
his
lips
were
wet
his
eyes
shone
he
had
a
hand
in
his
pocket
and
death
realized
that
getting
his
attacker
close
in
would
be
smart
if
he
had
a
knife
the
hand
came
out
it
was
pudgy
and
and
the
fingernails
were
all
gnawed
down
to
the
quick
death
looked
at
it
mace
he
did
wait
to
find
out
he
launched
himself
off
the
railing
at
the
fat
man
going
for
his
wet
whistling
cave
of
a
mouth
the
man
nodded
as
he
came
for
him
and
let
him
paste
one
on
him
death
rings
drew
blood
on
the
fat
cheek
and
rocked
the
head
back
a
bit
the
man
stepped
back
and
armed
away
the
blood
with
his
sleeve
death
was
running
for
his
car
hand
digging
into
his
pocket
for
his
phone
he
managed
to
get
the
phone
out
and
his
hand
on
the
door
handle
before
the
fat
man
caught
up
breathing
heavily
air
whistling
through
his
nose
he
punched
death
in
the
mouth
in
a
vastly
superior
rendition
of
death
sole
brave
blow
a
punch
so
hard
death
neck
made
a
crackling
sound
as
his
head
rocked
away
slamming
off
the
car
frame
ringing
like
a
gong
death
began
to
slide
down
the
car
door
and
only
managed
to
turn
his
face
slightly
when
the
man
sprayed
him
with
his
little
aerosol
can
mace
death
breath
stopped
in
his
lungs
and
his
face
felt
as
if
plunged
it
into
boiling
oil
his
eyes
felt
worse
like
dirty
fingers
were
sandpapering
over
his
eyeballs
he
choked
and
fell
over
and
heard
the
man
laugh
then
a
boot
caught
him
in
the
stomach
and
while
he
was
doubled
over
it
came
down
again
on
his
skinny
shin
the
sound
of
the
bone
breaking
was
loud
enough
to
be
heard
over
the
roaring
of
the
blood
in
his
ears
he
managed
to
suck
in
a
lungful
of
air
and
scream
it
out
and
the
boot
connected
with
his
mouth
kicking
him
hard
and
making
him
bite
his
tongue
blood
filled
his
mouth
a
rough
hand
seized
him
by
the
hair
and
the
rasping
breath
was
in
his
ears
you
should
just
shut
the
fuck
up
about
disney
on
the
fucking
internet
you
know
that
kid
the
man
slammed
his
head
against
the
pavement
just
shut
the
fuck
up
bang
bang
bang
death
thought
he
lose
consciousness
soon
he
had
no
idea
that
pain
could
be
this
intense
but
he
did
lose
consciousness
for
a
long
long
time
and
the
pain
could
be
a
lot
more
intense
as
it
turned
out
sammy
did
want
the
writer
meeting
him
at
his
office
his
organization
had
lots
of
people
who
been
loyal
to
the
old
gothy
park
and
even
to
death
waits
they
plotted
against
him
they
wrote
about
him
on
the
fucking
internet
reporting
on
what
he
eaten
for
lunch
and
who
shouted
at
him
in
his
office
and
how
the
numbers
were
declining
and
how
none
of
the
design
crews
wanted
to
work
on
his
new
rides
the
writer
could
come
to
the
office
could
come
within
miles
of
the
park
in
fact
if
sammy
had
had
his
way
they
would
have
done
this
all
by
phone
but
when
he
emailed
the
writer
he
said
that
he
was
in
florida
already
and
would
be
happy
to
come
and
meet
up
of
course
he
was
in
florida
he
was
covering
the
ride
the
trick
was
to
find
a
place
where
no
one
but
no
one
from
work
would
go
that
meant
going
as
touristy
as
possible
something
overpriced
and
kitschy
camelot
was
just
the
place
it
had
once
been
a
demolition
derby
stadium
and
then
had
done
turns
as
a
a
and
a
discount
wicker
furniture
outlet
now
it
was
orlando
number
two
dining
experience
catering
to
consolidators
who
needed
somewhere
to
fill
the
gullets
of
their
busloads
of
tourists
watching
men
in
armor
joust
at
low
speed
on
nags
took
care
of
an
evening
worth
of
entertainment
too
sammy
parked
between
two
giant
tour
coaches
then
made
his
way
to
the
entrance
he
told
the
guy
what
he
looked
like
and
the
guy
had
responded
with
an
obvious
publicity
shot
that
made
him
look
like
puck
from
a
performance
of
midsummer
unruly
hair
mischievous
grin
when
he
turned
up
though
he
was
ten
years
older
a
cigarette
jammed
in
the
yellowing
crooked
stumps
of
his
teeth
he
needed
a
shower
and
there
was
egg
on
the
front
of
his
denim
jacket
i
sammy
sammy
said
you
must
be
freddy
freddy
spat
the
cigarette
to
one
side
and
shook
with
him
the
palms
were
clammy
and
wet
pleasure
to
meet
you
freddy
said
camelot
huh
taste
of
home
for
you
i
expect
sammy
said
tally
ho
pip
pip
freddy
scrunched
his
face
up
in
an
elaborate
sneer
you
are
joking
right
i
joking
if
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
taste
of
home
i
have
invited
you
to
the
rose
and
crown
pub
in
epcot
a
jolly
ol
good
time
at
the
rose
and
crown
still
joking
i
trust
still
joking
sammy
said
this
place
does
a
decent
roast
beef
and
it
private
enough
private
in
the
sense
of
full
of
screaming
stupid
tourists
stuffing
their
faces
exactly
sammy
took
a
step
toward
the
automatic
doors
before
we
go
in
though
freddy
said
before
we
go
in
why
are
you
talking
to
me
at
all
mr
disney
parks
executive
he
was
ready
for
this
one
i
figured
that
sooner
or
later
you
want
to
know
more
about
this
end
of
the
story
that
you
been
covering
i
figured
it
was
in
my
employer
best
interest
to
see
to
it
that
you
got
my
version
the
reporter
grin
was
wet
and
mean
i
thought
it
was
something
like
that
you
understand
that
i
going
to
write
this
the
way
i
see
it
not
the
way
you
spin
it
right
sammy
put
a
hand
on
his
heart
of
course
i
never
would
have
asked
anything
less
of
you
the
reporter
nodded
and
stepped
inside
the
depths
of
camelot
the
greeter
had
acne
and
a
pair
of
tights
that
showed
off
his
skinny
he
took
off
his
great
peaked
cap
with
its
long
plume
and
made
a
stiff
little
bow
greetings
milords
to
camelot
yon
feast
awaits
and
our
brave
knights
stand
ready
to
do
battle
for
their
honor
and
your
amusement
freddy
rolled
his
eyes
at
sammy
but
sammy
made
a
little
scooting
gesture
and
handed
the
greeter
their
tickets
which
were
ringside
if
he
was
going
to
go
to
a
place
like
camelot
he
could
at
least
get
the
best
seats
in
the
house
they
settled
in
and
let
the
serving
wench
whose
fancy
contact
lenses
piercings
and
electric
blue
were
seriously
take
their
roast
beef
orders
and
serve
them
gigantic
pewter
tankards
of
ale
bud
light
and
the
logo
was
stamped
into
the
sides
of
the
tankards
tell
me
your
story
then
freddy
said
the
tourists
around
them
were
noisy
and
already
a
little
drunk
their
conversation
loud
to
be
heard
over
the
looping
soundtrack
of
ren
faire
polka
music
well
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
about
the
new
disney
parks
organization
a
lot
of
people
think
of
us
as
being
just
another
subsidiary
of
the
mouse
like
back
in
the
old
days
but
since
the
ipo
we
our
own
company
we
license
some
trademarks
from
disney
and
operate
rides
based
on
them
but
we
also
aggressively
license
from
other
parties
warners
universal
nintendo
even
the
french
publisher
responsible
for
asterix
that
means
that
we
get
a
lot
of
people
coming
in
and
out
of
the
organization
contractors
or
consultants
working
on
designing
a
single
ride
or
show
that
creates
a
lot
of
opportunities
for
corporate
espionage
knowing
what
properties
we
considering
licensing
gives
the
competition
a
chance
to
get
there
ahead
of
us
to
land
an
exclusive
deal
that
sets
us
back
on
square
one
it
ugly
stuff
they
call
it
intelligence
but
it
just
spying
plain
old
spying
all
of
our
employees
have
been
contacted
one
time
or
another
by
someone
with
an
offer
get
me
a
uniform
or
a
pic
of
the
design
roughs
or
a
recording
of
the
soundtrack
or
a
copy
of
the
contracts
and
i
make
it
worth
your
while
from
to
senior
execs
the
money
is
just
sitting
there
waiting
for
us
to
pick
it
up
the
wench
brought
them
their
gigantic
pewter
plates
of
yorkshire
pudding
parsnips
and
a
mountain
of
french
fries
presumably
to
appease
the
appetites
of
the
more
unadventurous
diners
freddy
sliced
off
a
lump
of
beef
and
skewered
it
on
his
fork
you
going
to
tell
me
that
the
temptation
overwhelmed
one
of
your
employees
yes
he
shoved
the
entire
lump
into
his
mouth
and
began
to
masticate
it
cheeks
pouched
out
looking
like
a
kid
with
a
mouthful
of
precisely
our
competitors
do
want
to
compete
with
us
on
a
level
playing
field
they
are
more
than
anything
imitators
they
take
the
stuff
that
we
carefully
build
based
on
extensive
research
design
and
testing
and
they
clone
it
for
amusement
rides
there
no
attention
to
detail
there
no
attention
to
safety
it
all
cowboys
and
gypsies
freddy
kept
chewing
but
he
dug
in
the
pockets
of
his
and
came
up
with
a
small
stubby
notebook
and
a
he
jotted
some
notes
shielding
the
pad
with
his
body
and
these
crass
imitators
enter
into
our
story
how
freddy
asked
around
his
beef
you
know
about
these
new
work
people
they
call
themselves
but
that
just
a
smokescreen
they
like
to
cloak
themselves
in
some
commons
legitimacy
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it
they
made
their
fortune
off
the
intellectual
property
of
others
uncompensated
use
of
designs
and
technologies
that
others
had
invested
in
and
created
so
when
they
made
a
ride
it
was
much
of
much
like
some
kind
of
dusty
commie
museum
old
trophies
from
their
last
campaign
but
somewhere
along
the
way
they
hooked
up
with
one
of
these
brokers
who
specializes
in
sneaking
our
secrets
out
of
the
park
and
into
the
hands
of
our
competitors
and
quick
as
that
they
were
profitable
nationally
franchised
even
he
stopped
to
quaff
his
bud
light
and
surreptitiously
checked
out
the
journalist
to
see
how
much
of
this
he
was
buying
impossible
to
say
he
was
still
masticating
a
cheekful
of
rare
roast
juice
overflowing
the
corners
of
his
mouth
but
his
hand
moved
over
his
pad
and
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
with
his
head
swallowing
some
of
his
payload
we
fired
some
of
the
people
responsible
for
the
breaches
but
there
will
be
more
with
castmembers
the
writer
snorted
a
laugh
at
the
and
choked
a
little
washing
down
the
last
of
his
mouthful
with
a
chug
of
it
inevitable
that
they
find
more
these
meanwhile
have
moved
to
the
last
refuge
of
the
scoundrel
internet
message
boards
petulant
tweets
and
whiny
blogs
where
they
busily
running
us
down
we
ca
win
but
at
least
we
can
stanch
the
bleeding
that
why
brought
our
lawsuits
and
why
we
bring
the
next
round
the
journalist
hand
moved
some
more
then
he
turned
a
fresh
page
i
see
i
see
yes
all
fascinating
really
but
what
about
these
countersuits
more
posturing
pirates
love
to
put
on
aggrieved
airs
these
guys
ripped
us
off
and
got
caught
at
it
and
now
they
want
to
sue
us
for
their
trouble
you
know
how
work
they
just
a
bid
to
get
a
fast
settlement
i
did
something
bad
but
so
did
you
why
do
we
shake
hands
and
call
it
a
day
uh
huh
so
you
telling
me
that
these
intellectual
property
pirates
made
a
fortune
knocking
off
your
rides
and
that
they
only
you
to
get
a
settlement
out
of
you
huh
that
it
in
a
nutshell
i
wanted
to
sit
down
with
you
on
background
and
just
give
you
our
side
of
things
the
story
you
get
from
the
i
know
you
the
only
one
trying
to
really
get
at
the
story
behind
the
story
with
these
people
freddy
had
finished
his
entire
roast
and
was
working
his
way
through
the
fries
and
limp
yorkshire
pudding
he
waved
vigorously
at
their
serving
wench
and
hollered
more
here
love
and
quaffed
his
beer
sammy
dug
into
his
cold
dinner
and
speared
up
a
forkful
waiting
for
freddy
to
finish
swallowing
well
that
a
very
neat
little
story
mr
disney
executive
off
the
record
on
background
sammy
felt
a
vivid
twinge
of
anxiety
eyes
glittered
in
the
torchlight
very
neat
indeed
let
me
tell
you
one
of
my
own
when
i
was
a
young
man
before
i
took
up
the
pen
i
worked
a
series
of
completely
rubbish
jobs
i
cleaned
toilets
i
drove
a
taxi
i
stocked
grocery
shelves
you
may
ask
how
this
qualified
me
to
write
about
the
technology
industry
lots
of
people
have
in
fact
asked
that
i
tell
you
why
it
qualifies
me
it
qualifies
me
because
unlike
all
the
bloggers
rich
and
comfortable
geeks
whose
masturbatory
rants
about
apple
not
honoring
their
warranties
are
what
passes
for
corporate
criticism
online
i
been
there
i
not
from
a
rich
family
i
did
get
to
go
to
the
best
schools
no
one
put
a
pc
in
my
bedroom
when
i
was
six
i
worked
for
an
honest
living
before
i
gave
up
honest
work
to
write
as
much
as
the
internet
disgusts
me
it
not
a
patch
on
the
businesses
themselves
you
disney
people
with
your
minimum
wage
and
all
the
sexual
harassment
you
can
eat
labor
policies
in
your
nice
state
you
get
away
with
murder
anyone
who
criticizes
you
does
so
on
your
own
terms
is
disney
exploiting
its
workers
too
much
is
it
being
too
aggressive
in
policing
its
intellectual
property
should
it
be
nicer
about
it
i
the
writer
who
does
watch
your
corporations
on
your
own
terms
i
do
care
if
another
business
is
unfairly
competing
with
your
business
i
care
that
your
business
is
unfair
to
the
world
that
it
aggressively
exploits
children
to
get
their
parents
to
spend
money
they
do
have
on
junk
they
do
need
i
care
that
your
workers
ca
unionize
make
shit
wages
and
get
fired
when
they
complain
or
when
you
need
to
flex
your
power
a
little
i
grew
up
without
any
power
at
all
when
i
was
working
for
a
living
i
had
no
say
at
all
in
my
destiny
it
did
matter
how
much
shit
a
boss
wanted
to
shovel
on
me
all
i
could
do
was
stand
and
take
it
now
i
got
some
power
and
i
plan
on
using
it
to
setting
things
to
rights
sammy
chewed
his
roast
long
past
the
point
that
it
was
ready
to
swallow
the
fact
that
he
made
an
error
was
readily
apparent
from
the
start
of
freddy
little
speech
but
with
each
passing
minute
the
depth
of
his
error
grew
he
really
fucked
up
he
felt
like
throwing
up
this
guy
was
going
to
fuck
him
he
could
tell
freddy
smiled
and
quaffed
and
wiped
at
his
beard
with
the
embroidered
napkin
oh
look
the
jousting
about
to
start
he
said
knights
in
armor
on
horseback
circled
the
arena
lances
held
high
the
crowd
applauded
and
an
announcer
came
on
the
pa
to
tell
them
each
name
referring
them
to
a
program
printed
on
their
placemats
sammy
pretended
to
be
interested
while
freddy
cheered
them
on
that
same
look
of
unholy
glee
plain
on
his
face
the
knights
formed
up
around
the
ring
and
their
pimply
squires
came
out
of
the
gate
and
tended
to
them
there
was
a
squire
and
knight
right
in
front
of
them
and
the
squire
tipped
his
hat
to
them
freddy
handed
the
kid
a
bill
sammy
never
tipped
live
performers
he
hated
buskers
and
panhandlers
it
all
reminded
him
of
stuffing
a
stripper
he
liked
his
media
a
little
more
impersonal
than
that
but
freddy
was
looking
at
him
so
with
a
weak
little
smile
he
handed
the
squire
the
smallest
thing
in
his
wallet
a
twenty
the
jousting
began
it
was
terrible
the
knights
could
ride
worth
a
damn
their
lances
missed
one
another
by
farcical
margins
and
their
falls
were
so
obviously
staged
that
even
the
chubby
ten
year
old
beside
him
was
clearly
unimpressed
got
to
go
to
the
bathroom
he
said
into
freddy
ear
in
leaning
over
he
contrived
to
get
a
look
at
the
reporter
notebook
it
was
covered
in
obscene
doodles
of
mickey
mouse
with
a
huge
erection
minnie
dangling
from
a
noose
there
was
a
single
word
written
on
it
what
little
blood
was
left
in
sammy
head
drained
into
his
feet
which
were
leaden
and
uncoordinated
on
the
long
trip
to
the
filthy
toilets
he
splashed
cold
water
on
his
face
in
the
sink
and
then
headed
back
toward
his
seat
he
never
made
it
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
leading
down
to
ringside
he
saw
freddy
quaffing
more
ale
and
flirting
with
the
wench
the
thunder
of
and
the
soundtrack
of
cinematic
music
drowned
out
all
sounds
but
nothing
masked
the
stink
of
the
manure
falling
from
the
horses
half
of
which
were
panicking
the
other
half
appeared
to
be
drugged
this
was
a
mistake
he
thought
freddy
was
a
gossip
reporter
who
liked
juicy
stories
turned
out
he
was
also
one
of
those
tedious
types
who
would
happily
hang
sammy
out
to
dry
time
to
cut
his
losses
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
headed
for
the
door
the
doorman
was
having
a
cigarette
with
a
guy
in
a
who
was
wearing
a
manager
badge
on
his
lapel
leaving
so
soon
the
show
only
just
getting
started
the
manager
was
sweating
under
his
he
had
a
thin
mustache
and
badly
died
chestnut
hair
cut
like
a
lego
character
not
interested
sammy
said
all
the
stuff
distracted
me
blue
hair
cigarettes
the
doorman
guiltily
flicked
his
cigarette
into
the
parking
lot
sammy
felt
a
little
better
i
sorry
to
hear
that
sir
the
manager
said
he
was
prematurely
grey
under
the
for
he
could
have
been
more
than
years
old
and
working
a
job
like
this
sammy
was
this
is
where
he
might
end
up
if
his
came
back
to
haunt
him
would
you
like
a
no
sammy
said
any
outfit
that
ca
figure
out
clean
toilets
and
decent
theming
on
its
own
ca
benefit
from
my
advice
the
doorman
flushed
and
looked
away
but
the
manager
smile
stayed
fixed
and
calm
maybe
he
was
drugged
like
the
horses
it
bothered
sammy
christ
how
long
until
this
place
gets
turned
into
a
again
would
you
like
a
refund
sir
the
manager
asked
he
looked
out
at
the
parking
lot
sammy
followed
his
gaze
looking
above
the
cars
and
realized
suddenly
that
he
was
standing
in
a
cool
tropical
evening
the
sky
had
gone
the
color
of
a
ripe
plum
with
proud
palms
silhouetted
against
it
the
wind
made
them
sway
a
few
clouds
scudded
across
the
moon
luminous
face
and
the
smell
of
citrus
and
the
hum
of
insects
and
the
calls
of
night
birds
were
vivid
on
the
evening
air
he
been
about
to
say
something
cutting
to
the
manager
one
last
attempt
to
make
the
man
miserable
but
he
could
be
bothered
he
had
a
nice
porch
behind
his
house
with
a
hammock
he
sat
in
it
on
nights
like
this
years
ago
now
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
sit
in
it
again
good
night
he
said
and
headed
for
his
car
perry
cast
it
had
started
to
go
a
little
skunky
on
the
second
day
but
after
a
week
it
was
like
he
had
a
dead
animal
stuck
to
his
shoulder
a
rotting
dead
animal
a
rotting
itchy
dead
animal
i
do
think
you
supposed
to
be
doing
this
on
your
own
hilda
said
as
he
sawed
awkwardly
at
it
with
the
utility
knife
it
was
made
of
something
a
lot
tougher
than
the
fiberglass
one
he
had
when
he
broke
his
leg
falling
off
the
roof
as
a
kid
he
been
up
there
scouting
out
glider
possibilities
so
you
do
it
he
said
handing
her
the
knife
he
could
stand
the
smell
for
one
second
longer
not
me
pal
no
way
that
thing
is
supposed
to
come
off
anytime
soon
if
you
going
to
cripple
yourself
you
going
to
have
to
do
it
on
your
own
he
made
a
rude
sound
fuck
hospitals
fuck
doctors
and
fuck
this
fucking
cast
my
arm
barely
hurts
these
days
we
can
splint
it
once
i
get
this
off
that
immobilize
it
they
told
me
i
need
this
for
i
ca
wear
this
for
six
weeks
i
go
nuts
you
go
lame
if
you
take
it
off
your
poor
mother
you
must
have
driven
her
nuts
he
slipped
and
cut
himself
and
winced
but
tried
not
to
let
her
know
because
that
exactly
what
she
predicted
would
happen
after
a
couple
days
together
she
become
an
expert
at
predicting
exactly
which
of
his
escapades
would
end
in
disaster
it
was
a
little
spooky
blood
oozed
out
from
under
the
cast
and
slicked
his
hand
right
off
to
the
hospital
i
told
you
you
get
this
thing
wet
if
you
got
in
the
shower
i
told
you
that
it
would
stink
and
rot
and
itch
if
you
did
i
told
you
to
let
me
give
you
a
sponge
bath
i
not
insured
we
go
to
the
free
clinic
defeated
he
let
her
lead
him
to
her
car
she
helped
him
buckle
in
wrinkling
her
nose
what
wrong
baby
she
said
looking
at
his
face
what
are
you
moping
about
it
just
the
cast
he
said
looking
away
she
grabbed
him
by
the
chin
and
turned
him
to
face
her
look
do
that
do
do
that
if
something
bothering
you
we
going
to
talk
about
it
i
did
sign
up
to
fall
in
love
with
the
strong
silent
type
you
been
sulking
all
day
now
what
it
about
he
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
all
right
i
give
in
i
miss
home
they
all
in
the
middle
of
it
running
the
ride
and
stuff
and
i
here
he
felt
a
moment
worry
that
she
be
offended
not
that
i
do
love
being
here
with
you
but
i
feeling
guilty
ok
i
get
it
of
course
you
feel
guilty
it
your
project
it
in
trouble
and
you
not
taking
care
of
it
christ
perry
is
that
all
i
would
have
been
disappointed
if
this
was
worrying
you
let
go
to
florida
then
what
she
kissed
the
tip
of
his
nose
take
me
to
florida
let
meet
your
friends
but
were
they
moving
in
together
or
something
he
was
totally
smitten
with
this
girl
but
that
was
even
for
perry
you
need
to
be
here
they
can
live
without
me
it
not
like
i
proposing
to
move
in
with
you
i
come
back
here
after
a
while
but
i
only
doing
two
classes
this
term
and
they
both
offered
by
let
just
go
when
after
the
hospital
you
need
a
new
cast
stinkmeister
roll
down
your
window
a
little
ok
whew
the
doctors
warned
him
to
let
the
new
cast
set
overnight
before
subjecting
it
to
the
rigors
of
a
tsa
examination
so
they
spent
one
more
night
at
hilda
place
perry
spent
it
going
over
the
mailing
list
traffic
and
blog
posts
confirming
the
plane
tickets
ordering
a
car
to
meet
them
at
the
miami
airport
he
finally
managed
to
collapse
into
bed
at
and
hilda
grabbed
him
dragged
him
to
her
and
spooned
him
tightly
do
worry
baby
your
friends
and
i
will
get
along
great
he
had
realized
that
he
been
worrying
about
this
but
once
she
pointed
it
out
it
was
obvious
you
not
worried
she
ran
her
hands
over
his
furry
chest
and
tummy
no
of
course
not
your
friends
will
love
me
or
i
have
them
killed
more
to
the
point
they
love
me
because
you
love
me
and
i
love
you
and
they
love
you
too
what
does
ernie
think
of
me
he
said
thinking
of
her
brother
for
the
first
time
since
they
hooked
up
all
those
months
ago
oh
hum
she
said
he
stiffened
no
it
ok
she
said
rubbing
his
tummy
some
more
it
tickled
he
glad
i
with
someone
i
care
about
and
he
loves
the
ride
he
just
you
know
protective
of
his
big
sister
what
he
worried
about
just
what
you
expect
we
live
thousands
of
miles
apart
you
ten
years
older
than
me
you
been
getting
into
the
kind
of
trouble
that
attracts
armed
cops
would
you
be
protective
if
you
were
my
bro
i
was
an
only
child
but
sure
ok
i
see
that
it
nothing
she
said
really
bring
him
a
nice
souvenir
from
florida
when
we
come
back
to
madison
take
him
out
for
a
couple
beers
and
it
all
be
great
so
we
cool
all
the
families
are
in
agreement
all
the
stars
are
in
alignment
everything
is
hunky
dory
perry
gibbons
i
love
you
dearly
you
love
me
we
got
a
cause
to
fight
for
and
it
a
just
one
with
many
brave
comrades
fighting
alongside
of
us
what
could
possibly
go
wrong
what
could
possibly
go
wrong
perry
said
he
drew
in
a
breath
to
start
talking
it
was
rhetorical
goofball
it
also
three
in
the
morning
sleep
for
tomorrow
we
fly
lester
did
want
to
open
the
ride
but
someone
had
to
someone
had
to
and
it
was
perry
who
was
off
with
his
midwestern
honey
lester
would
have
loved
to
sleep
in
and
spend
the
day
in
his
workshop
rebuilding
his
registers
he
had
some
good
ideas
for
improving
on
the
initial
design
and
he
still
had
the
cad
files
which
were
the
hard
part
anyway
he
walked
slowly
across
the
parking
lot
the
sunrise
in
his
eyes
a
cup
of
coffee
steaming
in
his
hand
he
almost
gone
to
the
fatkins
bars
the
night
before
he
almost
gone
ten
fifteen
times
every
time
he
thought
of
suzanne
storming
out
of
his
lab
but
he
stayed
home
with
the
tv
and
waited
for
her
to
turn
up
or
call
or
post
something
to
her
blog
or
turn
up
on
im
and
when
none
of
those
things
had
happened
by
he
tumbled
into
bed
and
slept
for
three
hours
until
his
alarm
went
off
again
blearily
he
sat
himself
down
behind
the
counter
greeted
some
of
the
hawkers
coming
across
the
road
and
readied
his
the
first
customers
arrived
just
before
nine
an
east
indian
family
driving
a
car
with
texas
plates
dad
wore
khaki
and
a
and
leather
sandals
mom
was
in
a
beautiful
silk
sari
and
the
kids
looked
like
in
designer
versions
of
the
stuff
the
wild
kids
in
the
shantytown
went
around
in
they
came
out
of
the
ride
ten
minutes
later
and
asked
for
their
money
back
there
nothing
in
there
the
dad
said
almost
apologetically
empty
i
do
think
it
supposed
to
be
empty
is
it
lester
put
the
roll
of
tickets
into
his
pocket
and
stepped
into
the
his
eyes
took
a
second
to
adjust
to
the
dark
after
the
brightness
of
the
rising
florida
sun
when
they
were
fully
adjusted
though
he
could
see
that
the
tourist
was
right
busy
robots
had
torn
down
all
the
exhibits
and
scenes
leaving
nothing
behind
but
swarming
crowds
of
bots
on
the
floor
dragging
things
offstage
the
smell
of
the
printers
was
hot
and
thick
lester
gave
the
man
his
money
back
sorry
man
i
do
know
what
going
on
this
kind
of
thing
should
be
impossible
it
was
all
there
last
night
the
man
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
it
all
right
i
an
engineer
i
know
all
about
crashes
it
just
needs
some
debugging
i
sure
lester
got
out
a
computer
and
started
picking
through
the
logs
this
kind
of
failure
really
should
be
impossible
without
manual
oversight
the
bots
were
supposed
to
change
more
than
five
percent
of
the
ride
in
response
to
another
ride
changes
if
all
the
other
rides
had
torn
themselves
down
it
might
have
happened
but
they
had
had
they
no
they
had
a
quick
check
of
the
logs
showed
that
none
of
the
changes
had
come
from
madison
or
san
francisco
or
boston
or
westchester
or
any
of
the
other
either
his
robots
had
crashed
or
someone
had
hacked
the
system
he
rebooted
the
system
and
rolled
it
back
to
the
state
from
the
night
before
and
watched
the
robots
begin
to
bring
the
props
back
from
offstage
how
the
hell
could
it
have
happened
he
dumped
the
logs
and
began
to
sift
through
them
he
kept
getting
interrupted
by
riders
who
wanted
to
know
when
the
ride
would
come
back
up
but
he
did
know
the
estimates
were
oscillating
wildly
between
ten
minutes
and
ten
hours
he
finally
broke
off
to
write
up
a
little
flier
about
it
and
printed
out
a
couple
hundred
of
them
on
some
neon
yellow
paper
stock
he
had
lying
around
along
with
a
jumbo
version
that
he
taped
over
the
it
was
enough
belligerent
riders
who
traveled
for
hours
to
see
the
ride
wanted
a
human
explanation
and
they
pestered
him
ceaselessly
all
the
hawkers
felt
like
they
deserved
more
information
than
the
rubes
and
they
pestered
him
even
more
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
write
some
regexps
that
would
help
him
figure
out
what
was
wrong
so
he
could
fix
it
he
wished
that
death
kid
would
show
up
already
he
was
supposed
to
be
helping
out
from
now
on
and
he
seemed
like
the
kind
of
person
who
would
happily
jaw
with
the
marks
until
the
end
of
time
eventually
he
gave
up
he
set
the
sign
explaining
what
had
happened
or
rather
not
explaining
since
he
did
fucking
know
yet
down
in
the
middle
of
the
counter
bolted
it
down
with
a
couple
of
and
retreated
to
the
ride
interior
and
locked
the
doors
behind
him
once
he
had
some
peace
and
quiet
it
took
only
him
a
few
minutes
to
see
where
the
changes
had
originated
he
verified
the
info
three
times
not
because
he
was
sure
but
because
he
could
tell
if
this
was
good
news
or
bad
news
he
read
some
blogs
and
discovered
lots
of
other
were
chasing
this
down
but
none
of
them
had
figured
it
out
yet
grinning
hugely
he
composed
a
hasty
post
and
cced
it
to
a
bunch
of
mailing
lists
then
went
out
to
find
kettlebelly
and
tjan
he
found
them
in
the
guesthouse
sitting
down
to
a
working
breakfast
with
eva
and
the
kids
at
the
end
of
the
table
tjan
little
girl
was
trying
to
feed
pascal
but
not
doing
a
great
job
of
it
tjan
son
sat
on
his
lap
picking
at
his
pancakes
morning
guys
suzanne
narrowed
her
eyes
and
looked
away
the
table
fell
quiet
even
the
kids
sensed
that
something
was
up
who
watching
the
ride
lester
tjan
asked
quietly
it
shut
he
said
cheerfully
tjan
spoke
loudly
enough
that
everyone
jumped
a
little
lyenitchka
accidentally
stabbed
pascal
with
the
spoon
and
he
started
to
wail
suzanne
stood
up
from
the
table
and
walked
quickly
out
of
the
guesthouse
holding
on
to
her
phone
as
a
kind
of
thin
pretense
of
having
to
take
a
call
lester
chose
to
ignore
her
lester
held
his
hands
out
placatingly
it
ok
it
just
down
for
a
couple
hours
i
had
to
reset
it
after
what
happened
last
night
lester
waited
all
right
eva
said
i
bite
what
happened
last
night
brazil
came
online
lester
said
like
twenty
rides
opened
there
but
they
got
their
protocol
implementation
a
little
wrong
so
when
i
showed
up
the
whole
ride
had
been
zeroed
out
i
sure
i
can
help
them
get
it
right
in
the
meantime
i
got
the
ride
resetting
itself
and
i
blackholed
their
changes
temporarily
he
grinned
sunnily
how
fucking
cool
is
that
brazil
they
smiled
weakly
back
i
do
think
i
understand
lester
kettlewell
said
brazil
we
do
have
any
agreements
with
anyone
in
brazil
we
have
agreements
with
everyone
in
brazil
lester
said
we
got
an
open
protocol
and
a
server
that
anyone
can
connect
to
that
an
agreement
that
all
a
protocol
is
kettlewell
shook
his
head
you
saying
that
all
anyone
needed
to
do
to
reprogram
our
ride
was
to
connect
to
it
and
send
some
changes
trust
is
assumed
in
the
system
trust
is
you
have
changed
this
lester
took
a
step
back
no
i
have
changed
it
the
whole
system
is
open
that
the
point
we
ca
just
start
requiring
logins
to
get
on
the
network
the
whole
thing
would
collapse
it
be
like
putting
locks
on
the
bathroom
and
then
taking
the
only
key
for
yourself
we
just
ca
do
it
kettlewell
looked
like
he
was
going
to
explode
tjan
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
slowly
kettlewell
sat
back
down
tjan
took
a
sip
of
his
coffee
lester
can
you
walk
me
through
this
one
more
time
lester
rocked
back
and
forth
a
little
they
were
all
watching
him
now
except
for
suzanne
who
was
fuming
somewhere
or
getting
ready
to
go
home
to
russia
or
something
we
have
a
published
protocol
for
describing
changes
to
the
ride
it
built
on
system
for
marking
up
and
syncing
models
of
objects
it
what
we
used
all
through
the
kodacell
days
for
collaboration
the
way
you
get
a
ride
online
is
to
sync
up
with
our
and
then
instantiate
a
copy
then
any
changes
you
make
get
synced
back
and
we
instantiate
them
everyone
stays
in
sync
give
or
take
a
couple
hours
but
you
had
passwords
on
the
subversion
server
for
objects
right
yeah
but
we
did
design
this
one
to
take
passwords
it
a
lot
more
we
wanted
to
be
sure
that
people
we
did
know
could
get
in
and
play
kettlewell
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
tjan
rolled
his
eyes
i
think
what
kettlewell
trying
to
say
is
that
things
have
changed
since
those
carefree
days
we
in
a
spot
now
where
if
disney
or
someone
else
who
hated
us
wanted
to
attack
us
this
would
be
a
prime
way
of
doing
it
lester
nodded
yeah
i
figured
that
openness
always
costs
something
but
we
get
a
lot
of
benefits
out
of
openness
too
the
way
it
works
now
is
that
no
one
ride
can
change
more
than
five
percent
of
the
status
quo
within
hours
without
a
manual
approval
the
problem
was
that
the
brazilians
opened
like
rides
at
the
same
time
and
each
of
them
zeroed
out
and
tried
to
sync
that
and
between
them
they
did
way
more
than
percent
it
be
pretty
easy
to
set
things
up
so
that
no
more
than
five
percent
can
be
changed
period
within
a
period
without
manual
approval
if
you
can
do
that
why
not
set
every
change
to
require
approval
kettlewell
said
well
for
starters
because
we
end
up
spending
all
our
time
clicking
ok
for
adjustments
to
but
more
importantly
it
because
the
system
is
all
about
community
not
in
charge
we
just
part
of
the
network
kettlewell
made
a
sour
face
and
muttered
something
tjan
patted
his
arm
again
you
guys
in
charge
as
much
as
you
like
not
to
be
you
the
ones
facing
the
legal
hassles
you
the
ones
who
invented
it
we
did
really
lester
said
this
was
a
real
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
project
we
made
use
of
a
bunch
of
stuff
that
was
on
the
shelf
already
put
it
together
and
then
other
people
helped
us
refine
it
and
get
it
working
well
we
just
part
of
the
group
like
i
keep
saying
he
had
a
thought
besides
if
we
were
in
charge
brazil
would
have
been
able
to
zero
us
out
you
guys
are
being
really
weird
and
about
this
you
know
fixed
the
problem
no
one
can
take
us
down
like
this
again
it
just
wo
happen
i
put
the
fix
on
the
for
the
codebase
so
everyone
else
can
deploy
it
if
they
want
to
the
solved
we
be
shut
for
an
hour
or
two
but
who
cares
missing
the
big
picture
brazil
opened
fifty
rides
i
mean
it
sucks
that
we
did
notice
until
it
screwed
us
up
but
brazil
got
it
all
online
who
next
china
india
russia
kettlewell
said
looking
at
the
door
that
suzanne
had
left
by
he
was
clearly
trying
to
needle
lester
lester
ignored
him
i
love
to
go
to
brazil
and
check
out
how
they
done
it
i
speak
a
little
portuguese
even
enough
to
say
you
yet
anyway
you
lyenitchka
said
ada
giggled
and
said
weird
eva
shook
her
head
the
kids
have
got
a
point
she
said
you
people
are
all
a
little
weird
why
are
you
fighting
tjan
landon
you
came
here
to
manage
the
business
side
of
things
and
that
what
doing
lester
you
in
charge
of
the
creative
and
technical
stuff
and
that
what
you
doing
without
lester
you
two
would
have
any
business
to
run
without
these
guys
you
be
in
jail
or
something
by
now
make
peace
because
you
on
the
same
side
i
got
enough
children
to
look
after
here
kettlewell
snapped
a
nod
at
her
right
as
ever
darling
ok
i
apologize
all
right
me
too
lester
said
i
was
kidding
about
going
to
brazil
at
least
while
perry
still
away
he
coming
home
tjan
said
he
called
me
this
morning
bringing
the
girl
too
yoko
lester
said
and
grinned
ok
someone
should
get
online
and
find
out
how
all
the
other
rides
are
coping
with
this
i
sure
they
going
nutso
out
there
you
do
that
kettlewell
said
we
got
another
call
with
the
lawyers
in
ten
minutes
how
all
that
going
let
me
put
it
this
way
kettlewell
said
and
for
a
second
he
was
back
in
his
glory
days
slick
and
formidable
a
shark
i
liquidated
my
shares
in
disney
this
morning
they
down
fifty
points
since
the
nyse
opened
you
wait
until
tokyo
wakes
up
they
going
to
bail
and
bail
and
bail
lester
smiled
back
ok
well
that
good
then
he
hunkered
down
with
a
laptop
and
got
his
homebrew
wireless
rig
up
and
running
a
card
would
have
been
cheaper
but
his
rig
gave
him
lots
of
robustness
against
malicious
interference
and
plain
old
attenuation
and
got
his
headline
reader
running
he
set
to
reading
the
posts
and
dispelling
the
popups
that
tried
to
call
his
attention
to
this
or
that
his
filters
had
lots
to
tell
him
about
and
the
areas
of
his
screen
designated
for
different
interests
were
starting
to
pinken
as
they
accumulated
greater
urgency
he
waved
them
away
and
concentrated
on
getting
through
to
all
the
who
had
questions
about
his
patches
but
there
was
one
pink
area
that
would
go
it
was
his
serendipity
zone
where
things
that
did
match
his
filters
but
had
lots
of
interestingness
comments
and
reposts
from
people
he
paid
attention
to
and
some
confluence
with
his
keywords
turned
up
impatiently
he
waved
it
up
and
a
page
made
of
bits
of
livejournals
and
news
reports
and
assembled
itself
his
eye
fell
first
on
the
photos
but
for
the
shock
of
black
and
neon
green
hair
he
would
have
recognized
the
kid
in
the
pictures
as
death
waits
his
face
was
a
ruin
his
nose
was
a
bloody
rose
his
eyes
were
both
swollen
shut
one
ear
was
ruined
apparently
he
been
dragged
some
distance
with
that
side
of
his
head
on
the
ground
his
cheeks
were
pulpy
and
bruised
then
he
clicked
through
to
the
photos
from
where
they
found
death
before
they
cleaned
him
up
in
the
ambulance
and
he
had
to
turn
his
head
away
and
breathe
deeply
both
legs
and
both
arms
were
clearly
broken
with
at
least
one
compound
fracture
his
crotch
jesus
lester
looked
away
again
then
quickly
closed
the
window
he
switched
to
text
accounts
from
death
friends
who
been
to
see
him
in
the
hospital
he
would
live
but
he
might
not
walk
again
he
was
lucid
and
he
was
telling
stories
about
the
man
who
beaten
him
should
just
shut
the
fuck
up
about
disney
on
the
fucking
internet
you
know
that
kid
lester
got
up
and
went
to
find
kettlewell
and
tjan
and
suzanne
oh
especially
suzanne
again
he
did
think
for
one
second
that
death
would
have
invented
that
in
fact
it
was
just
the
sort
of
brave
thing
that
the
gutsy
little
kid
might
have
had
the
balls
to
report
on
every
step
he
took
he
saw
that
ruin
of
a
face
the
compound
fracture
the
luminous
blood
around
his
groin
he
made
it
halfway
to
the
guesthouse
before
he
found
himself
leaning
against
a
shanty
throwing
up
tears
and
bile
streaming
down
his
face
chest
heaving
lester
decided
that
this
was
about
fun
anymore
lester
came
to
understand
what
it
meant
to
be
responsible
for
people
lives
when
he
stood
up
and
wiped
his
face
on
the
tail
of
his
tight
glittering
shirt
he
was
a
different
person
sweating
in
the
suffocating
afternoon
heat
his
arm
on
fire
hilda
had
shown
him
the
article
about
death
waits
while
they
were
being
screened
for
their
connection
at
the
tsa
guy
was
swabbing
his
cast
with
a
residue
detector
and
as
perry
read
it
he
let
out
an
involuntary
yelp
and
a
jump
that
sent
him
back
for
a
full
round
of
tertiary
screening
no
date
with
jellyfinger
though
it
was
a
close
thing
hilda
was
deep
in
her
own
phone
probing
ferociously
at
it
occasionally
picking
it
up
and
talking
into
it
then
poking
at
it
some
more
neither
of
them
looked
out
the
windows
much
though
in
his
mind
perry
had
rehearsed
this
homecoming
as
a
kind
of
tour
of
his
territory
picking
out
which
absurd
landmarks
he
point
out
which
funny
stories
he
tell
pausing
to
nuzzle
hilda
throat
but
by
the
time
he
absorbed
the
traffic
and
done
a
couple
phoners
with
the
people
back
in
madison
particularly
ernie
who
was
freaking
about
death
waits
and
calling
for
tight
physical
security
for
all
their
people
they
were
pulling
in
at
the
ride
the
cabbie
a
turk
was
very
cool
about
the
neighborhood
and
he
kept
slowing
down
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
offering
to
let
them
out
there
and
perry
kept
insisting
that
he
take
them
all
the
way
no
you
ca
just
drop
me
here
man
for
the
tenth
time
i
got
a
fucking
on
my
i
not
carrying
my
suitcase
a
mile
from
here
i
live
there
it
safe
god
it
not
like
i
asking
you
to
take
me
to
a
he
did
want
to
tip
the
guy
but
he
did
the
cabbie
was
just
trying
to
play
it
safe
lots
of
people
tried
to
play
it
safe
it
did
make
them
assholes
even
if
it
did
make
them
ineffectual
and
useless
while
perry
tipped
him
hilda
pulled
the
suitcase
out
of
the
trunk
and
she
barely
had
time
to
shut
the
lid
when
the
driver
roared
off
like
he
was
trying
to
outrun
a
sniper
perry
grimaced
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
triumphant
homecoming
he
was
supposed
to
be
showing
off
his
toys
all
he
wrought
to
this
girl
the
town
was
all
around
them
and
they
were
about
to
charge
in
without
even
pausing
to
consider
its
dr
seuss
wonderment
wait
a
sec
perry
said
he
took
her
hand
see
that
that
was
the
first
shanty
they
built
five
stories
now
the
building
was
made
of
prefab
concrete
for
the
first
couple
stories
then
successively
lighter
materials
with
the
made
of
bamboo
the
designs
are
experimental
from
the
army
corps
of
engineers
mostly
but
they
say
they
stand
a
hurricane
he
grimaced
again
probably
not
the
bamboo
one
of
course
of
course
hilda
said
what
that
one
she
picked
up
on
his
mood
she
knew
he
wanted
to
show
her
around
before
they
ended
up
embroiled
in
and
work
again
you
got
a
good
eye
my
dear
that
the
finest
bbq
on
the
continent
see
how
the
walls
are
a
little
sooty
looking
carbonized
ambrosia
a
mix
of
fat
and
spice
and
hickory
that
you
could
scrape
off
and
bottle
as
perfume
eww
you
have
tried
lemarr
ribs
yet
he
said
and
goosed
her
she
squeaked
and
punched
him
in
the
shoulder
he
showed
her
the
the
kids
playing
the
tutor
place
the
center
the
workshops
taking
her
on
a
tour
of
this
place
help
conjure
into
existence
now
there
someone
i
have
seen
in
far
too
long
francis
said
he
aged
something
fierce
in
the
last
year
booze
making
his
face
subside
into
a
mess
of
wrinkles
and
pouches
and
broken
he
gave
perry
a
hard
hug
that
smelled
of
booze
and
it
was
even
lunchtime
francis
meet
hilda
hammersen
hilda
meet
francis
clammer
aerospace
engineer
and
gentleman
of
leisure
he
took
her
hand
and
feinted
a
kiss
at
it
and
hilda
rolled
her
eyes
at
this
what
do
you
think
of
our
lovely
little
settlement
then
ms
hammersen
it
like
something
out
of
a
she
said
you
hear
stories
about
christiania
and
how
good
and
peaceful
it
all
was
but
whenever
you
see
squatters
on
tv
it
always
crack
houses
and
you
really
got
something
here
francis
nodded
we
get
a
bad
rap
but
we
no
different
really
from
any
other
place
where
people
take
pride
in
what
they
own
i
built
my
place
with
my
two
hands
if
jimmy
carter
had
been
there
with
habitat
for
humanity
we
would
have
gotten
no
end
of
good
press
because
we
did
it
without
a
dead
on
the
scene
we
crooks
perry
tell
you
about
what
the
law
does
around
here
perry
nodded
yeah
she
knows
francis
patted
his
cast
nice
hardware
buddy
so
when
some
gives
you
a
leg
up
you
a
help
yourself
you
a
chud
it
the
same
with
you
people
and
your
ride
if
you
had
the
backing
of
a
giant
corporation
with
claws
sunk
deep
into
kids
brains
you
be
every
operator
wet
dream
build
it
yourself
in
the
guts
of
a
dead
shopping
center
and
you
some
kind
of
slimy
underclass
maybe
that
true
said
hilda
but
it
not
necessarily
true
back
in
madison
the
locals
love
us
they
think
we
do
great
stuff
after
the
law
came
after
us
they
came
by
with
food
and
money
and
helped
us
rebuild
scrappy
activists
get
a
lot
of
love
in
this
country
too
not
everyone
wants
a
big
corporation
to
them
off
in
hippie
you
always
find
people
with
enough
brains
to
realize
that
their
neighbors
are
the
boogieman
but
there
ai
so
many
hippie
college
towns
these
days
i
wish
you
two
luck
but
i
think
you
be
nuts
to
walk
out
the
door
in
the
morning
expecting
anything
better
than
a
kick
in
the
teeth
that
made
perry
think
of
death
waits
and
the
sense
of
urgency
came
back
to
him
ok
we
have
to
go
now
he
said
thanks
francis
nice
to
meet
you
young
woman
he
said
and
when
he
smiled
it
was
a
painful
thing
all
pouches
and
wrinkles
and
sags
and
he
gimped
away
with
his
limp
more
pronounced
than
ever
they
tracked
down
the
crew
at
the
big
table
everyone
roared
greetings
at
them
when
they
came
through
the
door
a
proper
homecoming
but
when
perry
counted
heads
he
realized
that
there
was
no
one
watching
the
ride
guys
who
running
the
ride
they
told
him
about
brazil
then
and
hilda
listened
with
her
head
cocked
her
face
animated
with
surprise
dismay
then
delight
you
say
there
are
rides
open
all
at
once
lester
said
all
in
one
go
holy
mother
of
poo
hilda
breathed
perry
could
even
bring
himself
to
say
he
could
even
imagine
brazil
in
his
head
jungles
beaches
he
knew
nothing
about
the
country
they
built
rides
without
even
making
contact
with
him
he
and
lester
had
designed
the
protocol
to
be
open
because
they
thought
it
would
make
it
easier
for
others
to
copy
what
they
done
but
he
never
thought
it
was
like
vertigo
that
feeling
so
you
yoko
huh
lester
said
finally
it
made
everyone
smile
but
the
tension
was
still
there
something
big
had
just
happened
bigger
than
any
of
them
bigger
than
the
beating
that
had
been
laid
on
death
waits
bigger
than
anything
perry
had
ever
done
from
his
mind
to
a
nation
on
another
continent
you
the
sidekick
huh
hilda
said
lester
laughed
touche
it
very
nice
to
meet
you
and
thank
you
for
bringing
him
back
home
we
were
starting
to
miss
him
though
god
alone
knows
why
i
plan
on
keeping
him
she
said
giving
his
bicep
a
squeeze
it
brought
perry
back
to
them
the
little
girls
were
staring
at
hilda
with
saucer
eyes
it
made
him
realize
that
except
for
suzanne
and
eva
their
whole
little
band
was
boys
all
boys
well
i
home
now
he
said
he
knelt
down
and
showed
the
girls
his
cast
i
got
a
new
one
he
said
they
had
to
throw
the
old
one
out
so
i
need
your
help
decorating
this
do
you
think
you
could
do
the
job
lyenitchka
looked
critically
at
the
surface
i
think
we
could
do
the
gig
she
said
what
do
you
think
partner
tjan
snorted
out
his
nose
but
she
was
so
solemn
that
the
rest
kept
quiet
ada
matched
lyenitchka
critical
posture
and
then
nodded
authoritatively
sure
thing
partner
it
a
date
perry
said
we
gon
na
head
home
and
put
down
our
suitcases
and
come
back
and
open
the
ride
if
it
ready
it
time
lester
got
some
time
off
i
sure
suzanne
will
appreciate
having
him
back
again
another
silence
fell
over
the
group
tense
as
a
piano
wire
perry
looked
from
lester
to
suzanne
and
saw
in
a
second
what
was
up
he
had
time
to
notice
that
his
first
emotional
response
was
to
be
intrigued
not
sorry
or
scared
only
after
a
moment
did
he
have
the
reaction
he
thought
he
should
have
a
mixture
of
sadness
for
his
friend
and
irritation
that
they
had
yet
another
thing
to
deal
with
in
the
middle
of
a
hundred
other
crises
hilda
broke
the
tension
it
was
great
to
meet
you
all
dinner
tonight
right
absolutely
kettlewell
said
seizing
on
this
leave
it
to
us
we
book
someplace
just
great
and
have
a
great
dinner
to
welcome
you
guys
back
eva
took
his
arm
that
right
she
said
i
get
the
girls
to
pick
it
out
the
little
girls
jumped
up
and
down
with
excitement
at
this
and
the
baby
brothers
caught
their
excitement
and
made
happy
that
got
everyone
smiling
again
perry
gave
lester
a
solemn
supportive
hug
kissed
suzanne
and
eva
on
the
cheeks
suzanne
smelled
good
something
like
sandalwood
shook
hands
with
tjan
and
kettlewell
and
tousled
all
four
kids
before
lighting
out
for
the
ride
gasping
out
a
breath
as
they
stepped
into
the
open
air
death
waits
regained
consciousness
several
times
over
the
next
week
aware
each
time
that
he
was
waking
up
in
a
hospital
bed
on
a
crowded
ward
that
he
woken
here
before
and
that
he
hurt
and
remember
much
after
the
beating
had
started
but
after
a
week
or
so
he
found
himself
awake
and
aware
he
still
hurt
all
over
a
dull
and
distant
stoned
ache
that
he
could
tell
was
being
kept
at
bay
by
powerful
painkillers
there
was
someone
waiting
for
him
hello
darren
the
man
said
i
an
attorney
working
for
your
friends
at
the
ride
my
name
is
tom
levine
we
suing
disney
and
we
wanted
to
gather
some
evidence
from
you
death
did
like
being
called
darren
and
he
did
want
to
talk
to
this
dork
he
woken
up
with
a
profound
sense
of
anger
remembering
the
guy
shouting
about
disney
while
bouncing
his
head
off
the
ground
knowing
that
sammy
had
done
this
wanting
nothing
more
than
to
get
ahold
of
sammy
and
and
that
where
he
ran
out
of
imagination
he
was
perfectly
happy
drawing
torture
chambers
and
vampires
in
his
sketch
book
but
he
did
actually
have
much
stomach
for
you
know
per
se
can
we
do
this
some
other
time
his
mouth
hurt
he
lost
four
teeth
and
had
bitten
his
tongue
hard
enough
to
need
stitches
he
could
barely
understand
his
own
words
i
wish
we
could
but
time
is
of
the
essence
here
you
heard
that
we
bringing
a
suit
against
disney
right
no
death
said
must
have
come
up
while
you
were
out
anyway
we
are
for
unfair
competition
we
got
a
shot
at
cleaning
them
out
taking
them
for
every
cent
we
going
through
the
motions
now
and
been
a
motion
to
summarily
exclude
any
evidence
related
to
your
beating
from
the
proceedings
we
think
that
bs
it
clear
from
what
you
told
your
friends
that
they
wanted
to
shut
you
up
because
you
were
making
them
look
bad
so
what
we
need
is
more
information
from
you
about
what
this
guy
said
to
you
and
what
you
posted
before
and
anything
anyone
at
disney
said
to
you
while
you
were
working
there
you
know
that
that
guy
said
he
was
beating
me
up
because
i
talked
about
this
stuff
in
the
first
place
the
lawyer
waved
a
hand
there
no
way
they
come
after
you
now
they
look
like
total
assholes
for
doing
this
they
scared
stupid
now
i
going
to
want
to
formally
depose
you
later
but
this
is
a
interview
just
to
get
clear
on
everything
the
guy
leaned
forward
and
suddenly
death
waits
had
a
conviction
that
the
guy
was
about
to
punch
him
he
gave
a
little
squeak
and
shrank
away
then
cried
out
again
as
every
inch
of
his
body
awoke
in
hot
agony
a
feeling
like
grating
bones
beneath
his
skin
woah
take
it
easy
there
champ
the
lawyer
said
death
waits
held
back
tears
the
guy
was
going
to
hit
him
but
just
the
movement
in
his
direction
had
scared
him
like
he
leapt
out
holding
an
axe
the
magnitude
of
his
own
brokenness
began
to
sink
in
and
now
he
could
barely
hold
back
the
tears
look
the
guys
who
run
the
ride
have
told
me
that
i
have
to
get
this
from
you
as
soon
as
i
can
if
we
going
to
keep
the
ride
safe
and
nail
the
bastards
who
did
this
to
you
i
need
to
do
this
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
bug
you
but
i
got
my
orders
ok
death
snuffled
back
the
tears
the
back
of
his
throat
felt
like
it
had
been
sanded
with
a
rusty
file
water
he
croaked
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
sorry
buddy
just
the
iv
i
afraid
the
nurses
were
very
specific
let
start
ok
and
then
we
be
done
before
you
know
it
defeated
death
closed
his
eyes
start
he
said
his
voice
like
something
made
from
soft
tar
left
too
long
in
the
sun
sammy
knew
he
was
a
dead
man
the
only
thing
keeping
him
alive
was
legal
reluctance
to
read
the
net
hackelberg
had
a
couple
of
juniors
who
kept
running
on
hot
subjects
but
they
liked
to
print
them
out
and
mark
them
up
and
that
meant
that
they
lagged
a
day
or
two
behind
the
blogosphere
the
death
waits
thing
was
a
freaking
disaster
the
guy
was
just
supposed
to
put
a
scare
into
him
not
cripple
him
for
life
every
time
sammy
thought
about
what
would
happen
when
the
death
waits
thing
percolated
up
to
him
he
got
gooseflesh
damn
that
idiot
thug
anyway
sammy
had
been
very
clear
the
guy
who
knew
the
guy
who
knew
the
guy
had
been
reassuring
on
the
phone
when
sammy
put
in
the
order
sure
sure
nothing
too
rough
just
a
little
shoving
around
and
what
worse
is
the
idiot
kid
had
gotten
the
hint
sammy
get
it
if
a
stranger
beat
him
half
to
death
and
told
him
to
stop
hanging
out
in
well
the
would
go
damned
right
they
would
and
with
freddy
there
was
a
shoe
waiting
to
drop
freddy
report
on
their
interview
he
was
pretty
sure
of
that
off
the
record
means
something
even
to
journalists
like
honest
freddy
but
freddy
was
going
to
be
nice
to
him
in
that
much
was
sure
and
if
when
freddy
got
wind
of
the
death
waits
situation
he
began
to
hyperventilate
i
going
to
go
check
on
the
construction
he
said
to
his
personal
assistant
a
new
girl
they
sent
up
when
his
last
one
had
defected
to
work
for
wiener
wiener
after
sammy
shouted
at
her
for
putting
through
a
from
some
blogger
who
wanted
to
know
when
fantasyland
would
be
it
had
been
a
mistake
to
shut
down
fantasyland
just
to
get
the
other
managers
off
his
back
sure
the
rides
were
sick
dogs
but
there
had
been
life
in
them
still
construction
sites
do
bring
in
visitors
and
the
numbers
for
the
park
were
down
and
everyone
was
looking
at
him
never
mind
that
the
only
reason
the
numbers
had
been
as
high
as
they
were
was
that
sammy
had
saved
everyone
ass
when
he
done
the
goth
rehab
never
mind
that
the
real
reason
that
numbers
were
down
was
that
no
one
else
in
management
had
the
guts
to
keep
the
park
moving
and
improving
he
slowed
his
step
on
main
street
usa
and
forced
himself
to
pay
attention
to
his
surroundings
the
stores
on
main
street
had
been
into
helping
him
dump
all
the
superfluous
goth
merchandise
and
it
was
in
their
windows
and
visible
through
their
doors
the
fatkins
and
wagons
were
doing
a
brisk
trade
around
the
castle
roundabout
the
crowd
was
predominantly
veering
to
the
left
toward
adventureland
and
frontierland
and
liberty
square
while
the
right
side
of
the
plaza
which
held
the
gateways
to
fantasyland
and
tomorrowland
was
conspicuously
sparse
he
known
that
his
numbers
were
down
but
standing
in
the
crowd
flow
he
could
feel
it
he
cleared
the
castle
and
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
brink
of
fantasyland
it
should
be
impossible
to
stand
here
at
one
in
the
afternoon
there
should
be
busy
rushes
of
people
pushing
past
to
get
on
the
rides
and
to
eat
and
to
buy
stuff
but
now
there
were
just
a
few
kids
in
eyeliner
puffing
cloves
in
smokeless
hookahs
and
a
wasteland
of
hoardings
painted
a
shade
imagineering
called
green
for
its
ability
to
make
the
eye
slide
right
past
it
he
left
the
two
big
coasters
open
and
they
had
decent
queues
but
that
was
it
no
one
was
in
the
stores
and
no
one
was
bothering
with
the
zombie
maze
clouds
of
dust
and
loud
destruction
noises
rose
over
the
hoardings
and
he
slipped
into
a
staff
door
and
threaded
his
way
onto
one
of
the
sites
pausing
to
pick
up
a
safety
helmet
with
at
least
these
crews
were
efficient
he
long
ago
impressed
on
the
department
that
hired
construction
contractors
the
necessity
of
decommissioning
old
rides
with
extreme
care
so
as
to
preserve
as
much
of
the
collectible
value
of
the
finishings
and
trim
as
possible
it
was
a
little
weird
disney
customers
howled
like
stuck
pigs
when
you
shut
down
their
rides
then
fought
for
the
chance
to
spend
fortunes
buying
up
the
dismembered
corpses
of
their
favored
amusements
he
watched
some
cuban
kids
carefully
melting
the
hot
glue
that
had
held
the
skull
to
the
pillar
of
the
dia
de
los
muertos
facade
setting
them
atop
a
large
pile
of
other
trim
scythes
hooded
figures
tombstones
with
a
layer
of
aerogel
beneath
to
keep
the
garriture
from
scratching
the
whole
area
behind
the
hoardings
was
like
this
rides
in
pieces
towers
of
fiberglass
detritus
sandwiched
between
layers
of
aerogel
they
done
this
before
when
he
taken
fantasyland
down
and
fretted
every
moment
about
how
long
the
was
taking
there
were
exciting
new
plans
lurking
in
the
wings
then
waiting
to
leap
onstage
and
take
shape
he
had
some
of
the
ride
components
fabricated
by
a
contractor
in
kissimmee
but
large
chunks
of
the
construction
had
to
take
place
onsite
the
advantage
had
been
his
cheap
fabricators
new
materials
easy
collaboration
between
remote
contractors
and
his
people
no
one
had
ever
executed
new
rides
as
fast
and
as
well
as
he
had
the
things
had
basically
built
themselves
now
the
competition
was
using
the
same
tech
and
it
was
a
fucking
disaster
for
him
worse
and
worse
he
had
no
plans
for
what
was
to
come
afterward
he
thought
that
he
just
grab
some
of
the
audience
research
people
throw
together
a
fatkins
focus
group
or
two
and
give
imagineering
two
weeks
to
come
up
with
some
designs
they
could
put
up
fast
he
knew
from
past
experience
that
design
expanded
to
fill
the
time
available
to
it
and
that
the
best
stuff
usually
emerged
in
the
first
ten
days
anyway
and
after
that
it
was
all
committee
but
no
one
from
audience
research
wanted
to
return
his
calls
no
one
from
imagineering
was
willing
to
work
for
him
and
no
one
wanted
to
visit
a
section
of
the
park
that
was
dominated
by
construction
hoardings
and
demolition
dust
what
the
hell
was
happening
at
the
miami
ride
anyway
he
could
follow
it
online
run
the
flythroughs
of
the
ride
as
it
stood
even
download
and
print
his
own
versions
of
the
ride
objects
but
none
of
that
told
him
what
it
to
get
on
the
ride
to
be
in
its
clanking
bowels
surrounded
by
other
riders
pointing
and
marveling
and
laughing
at
the
scenes
and
motion
rides
were
things
that
you
had
to
ride
to
understand
describing
a
ride
was
like
talking
about
a
movie
so
abstract
and
remote
like
talking
about
sex
versus
having
sex
sammy
loved
rides
or
he
used
to
anyway
so
much
more
than
films
so
much
more
than
books
so
immersive
and
human
and
the
whole
crowd
thing
all
the
other
people
waiting
to
ride
it
or
just
getting
off
it
it
had
started
with
coasters
does
every
kid
love
coasters
but
he
ended
up
a
connoisseur
a
gourmand
who
loved
every
species
of
ride
from
to
monorails
carousels
to
there
been
a
time
when
he
ridden
every
ride
in
the
park
once
a
week
and
every
ride
in
every
nearby
park
once
a
month
that
had
been
years
before
now
he
sat
in
an
office
and
made
important
decisions
and
he
was
lucky
if
he
made
it
onto
a
ride
once
a
week
not
that
it
mattered
anymore
he
screwed
up
so
bad
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
he
ended
up
on
the
or
in
jail
he
realized
he
was
staring
glumly
at
the
demolition
and
pulled
himself
upright
sucked
in
a
few
breaths
mentally
kicked
himself
in
the
ass
and
told
himself
to
stop
feeling
sorry
for
himself
a
young
woman
pried
loose
another
resin
skull
finial
and
added
it
to
the
pile
placed
another
sheet
of
aerogel
on
top
of
it
people
loved
these
little
tchotchkes
they
had
a
relationship
with
disney
parks
that
made
them
want
to
come
again
and
again
to
own
a
piece
of
the
place
they
came
for
visits
and
then
they
visited
in
their
hearts
and
they
came
back
to
bring
their
hearts
home
it
was
an
extremely
profitable
dynamic
that
what
those
ride
people
up
in
the
were
making
their
hay
on
anyone
could
replicate
the
ride
in
their
you
have
to
fly
from
madison
to
orlando
to
have
a
little
refresher
experience
it
was
right
there
at
the
end
of
the
road
if
only
there
was
some
way
to
put
his
rides
his
park
right
there
in
the
riders
homes
in
their
literal
being
able
to
look
at
the
webcams
and
take
a
was
one
thing
but
it
was
the
physical
visceral
experience
of
being
there
the
maintenance
crew
had
finished
all
the
trim
and
now
they
were
going
after
the
props
and
animatronics
they
never
used
to
sell
these
off
because
manufacturing
the
guts
of
a
robot
was
too
finicky
to
do
any
more
than
you
had
to
it
was
far
better
to
repurpose
them
like
the
america
sings
geese
that
had
all
their
skin
removed
and
found
a
new
home
as
robots
in
the
for
the
old
star
tours
but
now
it
all
could
be
printed
to
order
fabbed
and
shipped
in
they
were
even
doing
their
own
machining
at
imagineering
anymore
that
was
all
fulfillment
just
email
a
drawing
to
a
shop
and
you
have
as
many
as
you
wanted
the
next
day
fedex
guaranteed
sammy
lips
drew
back
from
his
teeth
as
he
considered
the
possibility
that
the
ride
people
had
ordered
their
parts
from
the
same
suppliers
christ
on
a
bike
what
a
mess
and
there
in
the
pit
of
despair
at
the
bottom
of
his
downward
arc
sammy
was
hit
by
a
bolt
of
inspiration
put
disney
into
people
living
rooms
put
printers
into
their
homes
that
decorated
a
corner
of
their
rooms
with
a
replica
of
a
different
ride
every
day
you
could
put
it
on
a
coffee
table
or
scale
it
up
to
fill
your
basement
you
could
have
a
magic
room
that
was
a
piece
of
the
park
a
souvenir
that
never
let
go
of
disney
there
in
your
home
the
people
who
were
willing
to
spend
a
fortune
on
printed
skull
finials
would
cream
for
this
it
would
be
like
actually
living
there
in
the
park
it
would
be
imagineering
eye
for
the
fan
guy
he
could
think
of
a
hundred
ways
to
turn
this
into
money
give
away
the
printers
and
sell
subscriptions
to
the
refresh
sell
the
printers
and
give
away
the
refreshes
charge
sponsors
to
modify
the
plans
and
target
different
product
placements
to
different
users
the
possibilities
were
endless
best
of
all
it
would
extend
the
reach
of
disney
parks
further
than
the
stupid
ride
could
ever
go
it
would
be
there
on
the
coffee
table
in
the
rumpus
room
in
your
school
gym
or
at
your
summer
place
he
loved
it
loved
it
he
actually
laughed
aloud
what
a
idea
sure
he
was
in
trouble
big
trouble
but
if
he
could
get
this
thing
going
and
it
would
go
then
hackelberg
would
get
his
back
the
lawyer
did
give
a
shit
if
sammy
lived
or
died
but
he
would
do
anything
to
protect
the
company
interests
sure
no
one
from
imagineering
had
been
willing
to
help
him
design
new
rides
they
all
had
all
the
new
ride
design
projects
they
could
use
audience
research
too
but
this
was
new
not
old
new
and
new
was
always
appealing
to
a
certain
kind
of
novelty
junkie
in
imagineering
he
find
help
for
this
and
then
he
pull
together
a
and
a
timeline
and
a
critical
path
and
he
start
executing
he
wanted
a
prototype
out
the
door
in
a
week
christ
it
could
be
that
hard
those
ride
assholes
had
published
the
full
schematics
for
their
toys
already
he
could
just
rip
them
off
turnabout
is
fair
play
after
all
hilda
left
perry
after
a
couple
hours
working
the
together
she
wanted
to
go
for
a
shower
and
a
bit
of
an
explore
and
it
was
a
secret
relief
to
both
of
them
to
get
some
time
apart
after
all
that
time
living
in
each
others
pockets
they
were
intimate
strangers
still
not
yet
attuned
to
each
others
moods
and
needs
for
privacy
and
a
little
separation
was
welcome
welcome
too
was
perry
old
post
there
at
the
ticket
counter
like
lucy
lemonade
stand
in
peanuts
the
riders
came
on
thick
a
surprising
number
of
them
knew
his
name
and
wanted
to
know
how
his
arm
was
they
were
all
watching
the
drama
unfold
online
they
knew
about
the
brazilian
rides
coming
online
and
the
patch
lester
had
run
they
all
felt
a
proprietary
interest
in
this
thing
it
made
him
feel
good
but
a
little
weird
he
could
deal
with
having
friends
and
customers
but
fans
when
he
got
off
work
he
wandered
over
to
the
shantytown
with
a
bunch
of
the
vendors
to
have
a
customary
beer
and
plate
of
ribs
he
was
about
to
get
his
phone
out
and
find
hilda
when
he
spotted
her
gnawing
on
a
greasy
bone
with
suzanne
and
eva
well
he
said
delighted
skipping
around
the
barbecue
pit
to
collect
a
greasy
kiss
from
hilda
and
more
chaste
but
equally
greasy
pecks
on
the
cheek
from
suzanne
and
eva
looks
like
found
the
best
place
in
town
we
thought
we
show
her
around
suzanne
said
she
and
eva
had
positioned
each
other
on
either
side
of
hilda
using
her
as
a
buffer
but
it
was
great
to
see
that
they
were
on
something
like
speaking
terms
perry
had
no
doubt
that
suzanne
had
led
kettlewell
on
they
all
had
crushes
on
her
he
knew
it
but
that
did
mean
that
eva
would
resent
her
anyway
if
their
positions
were
reversed
he
would
have
had
a
hard
time
controlling
his
jealousy
they
been
wonderful
hilda
said
offering
him
a
rib
he
introduced
her
to
the
sellers
who
come
over
with
him
and
there
was
more
greasy
handshaking
and
hugging
and
the
proprietor
of
the
joint
started
handing
around
more
ribs
more
beers
and
someone
brought
out
a
set
of
speakers
and
their
to
a
nearby
wall
and
perry
dropped
one
of
his
earbuds
into
them
and
set
it
to
shuffle
and
they
had
music
kids
ran
past
them
in
shrieking
hordes
playing
some
kind
of
big
game
that
they
all
been
obsessed
with
perry
saw
that
ada
and
lyenitchka
were
with
them
clutching
brightly
colored
mobiles
and
trying
to
read
their
screens
while
running
away
from
another
gang
of
kids
who
were
clearly
it
taking
exaggerated
care
not
to
run
into
invisible
obstacles
indicated
on
the
screens
it
was
great
to
get
back
into
the
saddle
perry
said
digging
into
some
ribs
getting
sauce
on
his
fingers
i
had
no
idea
how
much
been
missing
it
hilda
nodded
i
could
tell
anyway
you
a
junkie
for
it
like
the
ones
who
show
up
all
about
the
supposedly
in
there
you
act
like
that
a
holy
box
suzanne
nodded
solemnly
she
right
the
two
of
you
you
and
lester
you
so
into
that
thing
you
the
biggest
fanboys
in
the
world
you
know
what
they
call
it
the
fans
when
they
get
together
to
chat
about
the
stuff
they
love
drooling
as
in
you
see
the
drool
i
posted
this
morning
about
the
new
girl
bedroom
scene
you
drool
like
no
one
business
when
you
talk
about
that
thing
it
a
holy
thing
for
you
you
guys
sound
like
you
been
comparing
notes
perry
said
making
his
funny
eyebrow
dance
eva
arched
one
of
her
fine
high
eyebrows
in
response
in
some
ways
she
was
the
most
beautiful
of
all
of
them
the
most
and
poised
of
course
we
were
sonny
your
young
lady
here
needed
to
know
that
you
are
an
the
women
camaraderie
was
almost
palpable
suzanne
and
eva
had
clearly
patched
up
whatever
differences
they
had
which
was
probably
bad
news
for
kettlewell
where
is
lester
anyway
he
had
planned
on
asking
but
mention
of
his
name
led
him
to
believe
he
could
probably
get
away
with
it
he
talking
to
brazil
suzanne
said
it
all
he
done
all
day
long
talking
to
brazil
wow
perry
thought
of
brazil
as
a
kind
of
abstract
thing
fifty
rogue
nodes
on
the
network
that
had
necessitated
a
hurried
software
patch
not
as
a
bunch
of
people
but
of
course
there
they
were
in
brazil
real
people
by
the
dozens
maybe
even
hundreds
building
rides
he
does
speak
spanish
though
perry
said
neither
do
they
dork
hilda
said
giving
him
an
elbow
in
the
ribs
portuguese
they
all
speak
some
english
and
he
using
automated
translation
stuff
for
the
hard
concepts
does
that
work
i
mean
any
time
i
tried
to
translate
a
in
japanese
or
hebrew
it
kind
of
read
like
noun
noun
noun
noun
verb
noun
random
suzanne
shook
her
head
that
how
most
of
the
world
experiences
most
of
the
net
perry
anglos
are
just
about
the
only
people
on
earth
who
do
read
the
net
in
languages
other
than
their
own
well
good
for
lester
then
he
said
suzanne
made
a
sour
face
that
let
him
know
that
whatever
peace
prevailed
between
her
and
lester
it
was
fragile
good
for
him
she
said
where
are
the
boys
landon
and
tjan
have
them
eva
said
they
been
holed
up
with
your
lawyers
going
over
strategy
with
them
when
i
walked
out
they
were
trying
to
get
the
firm
partners
to
take
shares
in
the
corporation
that
owns
the
settlement
in
lieu
of
cash
up
front
man
that
all
too
weird
for
me
perry
said
i
wish
we
could
just
run
this
thing
like
a
business
make
stuff
people
want
to
give
us
money
for
collect
the
money
and
spend
it
you
are
such
a
nerd
fatalist
suzanne
said
getting
involved
in
the
more
abstract
elements
of
commerce
does
make
you
into
a
suit
if
you
do
participate
and
take
an
interest
you
always
be
by
those
who
do
bull
perry
said
they
can
get
a
court
to
order
us
to
make
pi
equal
to
three
or
to
ensure
that
other
people
do
make
mickey
heads
in
their
rides
or
that
our
riders
do
think
of
disney
when
they
get
into
one
of
our
chairs
but
they
never
be
able
to
enforce
it
suzanne
suddenly
whirled
on
him
perry
gibbons
you
are
that
stupid
so
stop
acting
like
you
are
she
touched
his
cast
look
at
this
thing
on
your
arm
your
superior
technology
can
make
inferior
laws
irrelevant
you
assuming
that
the
machinery
of
state
is
unwilling
to
completely
shut
you
down
in
order
to
make
you
comply
with
some
minor
law
you
totally
wrong
they
come
after
you
and
break
your
head
perry
rocked
back
on
his
heels
he
was
suddenly
furious
even
if
somewhere
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
knew
that
she
was
right
and
he
was
mostly
angry
at
being
shown
up
in
front
of
hilda
i
been
hearing
that
all
my
life
suzanne
i
do
buy
it
look
it
just
keeps
getting
cheaper
and
easier
to
make
something
like
what
we
built
to
get
a
printer
to
get
goop
to
make
stuff
to
download
stuff
to
message
and
im
with
people
who
help
you
make
stuff
to
learn
how
to
make
it
look
the
world
is
getting
better
because
we
getting
better
at
routing
around
the
bullies
we
can
play
their
game
or
we
can
invent
a
new
game
i
refuse
to
be
sucked
into
playing
their
game
if
we
play
their
game
we
end
up
just
like
them
suzanne
shook
her
head
sadly
it
a
good
thing
you
got
tjan
and
kettlewell
around
then
to
do
the
dirty
work
i
just
hope
you
can
spare
them
a
little
pity
from
atop
your
moral
she
took
eva
by
the
arm
and
led
her
away
leaving
perry
shaking
with
hilda
bitch
he
said
kicking
the
ground
he
balled
his
hands
into
fists
and
then
quickly
relaxed
them
as
his
broken
arm
ground
and
twinged
from
the
sudden
tensing
hilda
took
him
by
the
arm
you
two
clearly
have
a
of
history
he
took
a
couple
deep
breaths
she
was
so
out
of
line
there
what
the
hell
anyway
why
should
i
have
to
he
stopped
he
could
tell
when
he
was
repeating
himself
i
do
think
that
she
would
be
telling
you
that
stuff
if
she
think
you
needed
to
hear
it
you
sound
like
you
on
her
side
i
thought
you
were
a
fiery
young
revolutionary
you
think
we
should
all
put
on
suits
and
incorporate
i
think
that
if
you
got
skilled
people
willing
to
help
you
you
owe
it
to
them
to
value
their
contribution
i
heard
you
complain
about
twenty
times
in
the
past
week
two
of
those
suits
are
on
your
side
they
putting
themselves
on
the
line
just
like
you
hell
they
doing
the
while
you
get
to
do
all
the
inventing
and
fly
around
the
country
and
get
laid
by
hot
groupies
she
kissed
his
cheek
trying
to
make
a
joke
of
it
but
she
really
hurt
his
feelings
he
felt
like
weeping
it
was
all
out
of
his
control
his
destiny
was
not
his
to
master
ok
let
go
apologize
to
kettlewell
and
tjan
she
laughed
but
he
only
been
halfway
kidding
what
he
really
wanted
to
do
was
have
a
big
old
dinner
at
home
with
lester
just
the
two
of
them
in
front
of
the
tv
eating
lester
fatkins
cuisine
planning
a
new
invention
he
was
tired
of
all
these
people
even
suzanne
was
an
outsider
it
had
just
been
him
and
lester
in
the
old
days
and
those
had
been
the
best
days
hilda
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
nuzzled
his
neck
poor
perry
she
said
everyone
picks
on
him
he
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
come
on
sulkypants
let
go
find
lester
and
he
can
call
me
some
more
that
always
cheers
you
up
it
was
two
weeks
before
death
waits
could
sit
up
and
prod
at
a
keyboard
with
his
broken
hands
some
of
his
pals
brought
a
laptop
around
and
they
commandeered
a
spare
dining
tray
to
keep
it
on
death
lap
was
in
no
shape
to
support
anything
heavy
with
sharp
corners
the
first
day
he
was
reduced
to
tears
of
frustration
within
minutes
of
starting
he
could
use
the
shift
key
could
really
use
the
mouse
and
the
meds
made
it
hard
to
concentrate
and
remember
what
he
done
but
there
were
people
on
the
other
end
of
that
computer
human
friends
whom
he
could
communicate
with
if
only
he
could
to
use
this
tool
that
he
lived
with
since
he
was
old
enough
to
sit
up
on
his
own
so
laboriously
peck
by
peck
key
by
key
he
learned
to
use
it
again
the
machine
had
a
mode
for
disabled
people
for
and
once
he
hit
on
this
it
went
faster
the
mode
tried
to
learn
from
him
learn
his
tremors
and
his
errors
and
cursing
and
so
emerge
something
that
was
uniquely
his
interface
it
was
a
kind
of
a
game
to
watch
the
computer
try
to
guess
what
was
meant
by
his
mashed
keystrokes
and
spastic
he
turned
on
the
webcam
and
aimed
it
at
his
eye
and
switched
it
to
retinal
scanner
mode
giving
it
control
of
the
pointer
then
watched
in
amusement
as
the
wild
leaping
of
the
cursor
every
time
a
needle
or
a
broken
bone
shifted
inside
his
body
was
becalmed
into
a
graceful
normalized
curve
it
was
humiliating
to
be
a
cripple
and
the
better
the
technology
worked
the
more
prone
it
was
to
reducing
him
to
tears
he
might
be
like
this
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
might
never
walk
without
a
limp
again
might
never
dance
might
never
be
able
to
reach
for
and
lift
objects
again
he
never
find
a
woman
never
have
a
family
never
have
grandkids
but
this
was
offset
by
the
real
people
with
their
real
chatter
he
obsessively
flew
through
the
brazilian
mode
strange
and
wonderful
but
nowhere
near
what
he
loved
from
his
variation
on
the
ride
he
could
roll
through
all
the
different
changes
he
made
with
his
friends
to
the
ride
in
florida
and
he
became
subtly
attuned
to
which
elements
were
wrong
and
which
were
right
it
was
on
one
of
these
flythroughs
that
he
encountered
the
story
leaping
out
of
the
ride
so
vividly
that
he
yelped
like
he
flexed
his
iv
into
a
nerve
again
there
it
was
irrefutable
and
indefinable
when
you
rode
through
there
was
an
escalating
tension
a
sense
of
people
who
belonged
to
these
exhibits
going
through
hard
changes
growing
up
and
out
once
he
seen
it
he
could
it
when
he
and
his
pals
had
started
to
add
their
own
stuff
to
the
ride
the
story
people
had
been
giant
pains
in
the
ass
accusing
them
of
something
they
called
narricide
destroying
the
fragile
story
that
humanity
had
laid
bare
there
now
that
he
seen
it
too
he
wanted
to
protect
it
but
he
could
see
by
skimming
forward
and
back
through
the
and
trying
different
flythroughs
that
the
story
was
being
undermined
by
the
goth
stuff
they
were
bringing
in
it
was
being
enhanced
it
was
telling
the
story
he
knew
of
growing
up
with
an
indefinable
need
to
be
to
reject
the
mainstream
and
to
embrace
this
subculture
and
aesthetic
it
was
the
story
of
his
tribe
and
and
it
got
realer
the
more
he
played
it
god
how
could
he
have
it
made
him
want
to
cry
though
that
might
have
been
the
meds
some
of
it
made
him
want
to
laugh
too
he
tried
laboriously
to
compose
a
post
that
expressed
what
he
was
feeling
but
every
attempt
came
out
sounding
like
those
story
mystics
he
battled
he
understood
now
why
they
sounded
so
so
he
rode
the
ride
virtually
again
and
again
spotting
the
and
the
sly
wit
and
the
wrenching
emotion
that
the
collective
intelligence
of
all
those
riders
had
created
discovered
it
was
like
the
story
was
there
all
along
lurking
like
the
statue
inside
a
block
of
marble
oh
it
was
wonderful
he
was
ruined
maybe
forever
but
it
was
wonderful
and
he
been
a
part
of
it
he
went
back
to
writing
that
post
he
be
laid
in
that
bed
for
a
long
time
yet
he
had
time
to
rewrite
if
you
ca
beat
them
rip
them
off
a
new
initiative
from
the
troubled
disney
parks
corporation
shows
how
a
little
imagination
can
catapult
an
ambitious
exec
to
the
top
of
the
corporate
ladder
word
has
it
that
samuel
page
the
vice
president
for
fantasyland
i
assure
you
i
am
not
making
that
up
has
been
kicked
upstairs
to
senior
vice
president
for
remote
delivery
of
park
experience
i
not
making
that
up
either
insiders
in
the
company
tell
us
that
remote
delivery
of
park
experience
is
a
plan
to
convince
us
to
give
the
mouse
a
piece
of
our
homes
which
will
be
constantly
refreshed
via
a
robot
printer
with
miniatures
of
the
disney
park
if
this
sounds
familiar
it
should
it
a
pale
imitation
of
the
if
slightly
less
evil
rides
movement
pioneered
by
perry
gibbons
and
lester
banks
previously
the
of
the
new
work
scandal
imitation
is
meant
to
be
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery
and
if
so
gibbons
and
his
cultists
must
be
blushing
red
this
is
cheap
irony
after
all
it
only
been
a
month
since
the
company
launched
ten
separate
lawsuits
against
various
incarnations
of
the
ride
for
trademark
violation
and
it
now
trying
to
duck
the
punishing
countersuits
that
have
risen
up
in
their
wake
most
ironic
of
all
word
has
it
that
page
was
responsible
for
both
ends
of
this
the
lawsuits
against
the
ride
and
the
decision
to
turn
his
company
into
purveyors
of
cheap
knockoffs
of
the
ride
page
is
best
known
among
park
aficionados
for
having
had
the
foresight
to
gut
the
children
fantasyland
district
in
walt
disney
world
and
replace
it
with
a
jumped
up
version
of
hot
topic
a
area
that
drew
down
the
nation
eyeliner
supply
to
dangerously
low
levels
it
was
apparently
that
sort
of
genius
that
led
page
to
his
latest
round
of
disasters
the
lawsuits
an
abortive
rebuilding
of
fantasyland
and
now
this
remote
delivery
scam
what
next
the
mouse
has
already
shipped
disney
dollars
an
abortive
line
a
disastrous
chain
and
oversaw
the
collapse
of
the
collectible
market
with
visionaries
like
page
at
the
helm
the
company
ca
help
but
notch
up
more
successes
death
was
deep
into
the
story
now
the
brazilians
had
forked
off
their
own
ride
they
had
their
own
new
work
culture
too
centered
in
the
favelas
so
they
had
different
stories
to
tell
some
of
the
ride
operators
imported
a
few
of
their
scenes
tentatively
and
some
of
the
ride
fans
were
recreating
the
brazil
scenes
on
their
own
passes
through
the
ride
it
was
all
in
there
if
you
knew
where
to
look
for
it
and
the
best
part
was
no
one
had
written
it
it
had
written
itself
the
collective
judgement
of
people
who
rode
through
had
turned
chaos
into
coherence
or
had
it
the
were
rife
with
speculation
that
the
story
had
been
planted
by
someone
maybe
the
ride
creators
maybe
some
clan
of
riders
who
inserted
it
deliberately
these
discussions
bordered
on
the
metaphysical
what
was
an
organic
ride
decision
it
made
death
waits
head
swim
the
thing
that
was
really
doing
his
head
in
though
was
the
disney
stuff
sammy
he
could
even
think
of
sammy
without
a
sick
feeling
in
his
stomach
crashing
waves
of
nausea
that
transcended
even
his
narcotic
haze
sammy
was
making
these
grotesque
parodies
of
the
ride
he
was
pushing
them
out
to
the
world
living
rooms
even
the
deleted
rides
from
the
glory
days
of
the
goth
fantasyland
in
miniature
if
he
still
been
at
disney
parks
he
would
have
loved
this
idea
it
was
just
what
he
loved
the
knowledge
that
he
was
sharing
experience
with
his
people
around
the
world
part
of
a
tribe
even
if
he
could
see
them
now
in
the
era
of
the
ride
he
could
see
how
dumb
this
was
how
thin
and
shallow
and
commercial
why
should
they
have
to
pay
some
giant
evil
corporation
to
convene
their
community
he
kept
trying
to
write
about
the
story
kept
failing
it
come
but
sammy
he
knew
what
he
wanted
to
say
about
sammy
he
typed
until
they
sedated
him
and
then
typed
some
more
when
he
woke
up
he
had
old
emails
to
refer
to
he
pasted
them
in
after
three
days
of
doing
this
the
lawyer
came
back
tom
levine
was
dressed
in
a
stern
suit
with
narrow
lapels
and
a
tie
pierced
with
some
kind
of
frat
pin
he
was
much
older
than
death
but
he
made
death
feel
like
a
little
kid
i
need
to
talk
to
you
about
your
internet
activity
he
said
sitting
down
beside
him
he
brought
along
a
taffy
assortment
bought
from
the
roadside
cut
into
molecules
and
other
odd
biological
forms
an
amoeba
a
skeleton
ok
death
said
they
switched
him
to
something
new
for
the
pain
that
day
and
given
him
a
he
could
use
to
drizzle
it
into
his
iv
when
it
got
bad
he
hit
it
just
before
the
lawyer
came
to
see
him
and
now
he
could
concentrate
much
plus
he
was
used
to
talking
writing
online
was
better
he
could
write
something
save
it
go
back
and
it
later
and
clean
it
up
if
it
turned
out
gone
off
on
a
stoned
ramble
you
know
we
engaged
in
some
very
litigation
here
right
darren
he
hated
it
when
people
called
him
darren
death
he
said
his
toothless
lisp
was
pathetic
like
an
old
wino
death
ok
this
litigation
needs
a
maximum
of
caution
and
control
this
is
a
journey
that
ends
when
we
broken
the
back
of
the
company
that
did
this
to
you
it
ends
when
we
take
them
for
every
cent
bankrupt
their
executives
take
their
summer
homes
freeze
their
accounts
you
understand
that
death
had
really
understood
that
it
sounded
pretty
tiring
exhausting
fifteen
years
he
was
only
nineteen
now
he
be
and
that
was
only
if
the
lawyer
was
estimating
correctly
oh
he
said
well
not
that
you
going
to
have
to
take
part
in
fifteen
worth
of
this
it
likely
we
be
done
with
your
part
in
a
year
tops
but
the
point
is
that
when
you
go
online
and
post
material
that
potentially
harmful
to
this
case
death
closed
his
eyes
he
posted
the
wrong
thing
this
had
been
a
major
deal
when
he
was
at
disney
what
he
was
and
was
allowed
to
post
about
though
in
practice
he
posted
about
everything
sticking
the
private
stuff
in
private
discussions
look
you
ca
write
about
the
case
or
anything
involved
with
it
that
what
it
comes
down
to
if
you
write
about
that
stuff
and
you
say
the
wrong
thing
you
could
blow
this
whole
suit
they
get
away
clean
death
shook
his
head
not
write
about
it
at
no
he
said
no
i
not
asking
you
death
i
can
get
a
court
order
if
i
have
to
this
is
serious
it
not
some
funny
little
game
there
are
billions
on
the
line
here
one
wrong
word
one
wrong
post
and
it
all
over
and
nothing
in
email
either
it
likely
everything
you
write
is
going
to
go
through
discovery
do
write
anything
personal
in
any
of
your
mail
nothing
you
would
want
in
a
court
record
i
ca
do
that
death
said
he
sounded
like
a
fucking
retard
between
talking
through
his
mashed
mouth
and
talking
through
the
tears
i
ca
i
live
in
email
well
now
you
have
a
reason
to
go
outside
this
is
up
for
negotiation
when
i
was
here
last
i
thought
i
made
the
seriousness
of
this
case
clear
to
you
i
frankly
amazed
that
you
were
immature
and
irresponsible
enough
to
write
what
i
read
i
ca
death
said
the
lawyer
purpled
he
did
look
like
a
tanned
preppie
anymore
he
looked
like
one
of
those
fathers
in
disney
who
was
about
to
seriously
lose
his
shit
and
haul
off
and
smack
a
whiny
kid
death
own
pawpaw
who
stood
in
for
his
father
had
gone
red
like
that
whenever
he
mouthed
off
a
sin
that
could
be
committed
even
without
opening
his
mouth
he
had
an
instinctive
reaction
to
it
and
the
lawyer
seemed
to
sense
this
looming
over
him
he
felt
like
he
was
about
to
be
eaten
you
listen
to
me
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
fuck
up
this
is
something
going
to
fuck
up
i
win
my
cases
and
you
not
going
to
change
that
there
too
much
at
stake
here
for
you
to
blow
it
all
with
your
childish
selfish
he
seemed
to
catch
himself
then
and
he
snorted
a
hot
breath
through
his
nose
that
blew
over
death
face
listen
there
a
lot
on
the
line
here
more
money
than
you
or
i
are
worth
i
trying
to
help
you
out
here
whatever
you
write
whatever
you
say
it
going
to
be
very
closely
scrutinized
from
now
on
you
should
treat
every
piece
of
information
that
emanates
from
your
fingertips
as
likely
to
be
covered
on
the
evening
news
and
repeated
to
everyone
you
ever
met
no
matter
how
private
you
think
you
being
it
come
out
it
not
pretty
and
i
know
you
did
ask
for
it
but
you
here
and
nothing
you
can
do
to
change
that
he
left
then
embarrassed
at
losing
his
temper
embarrassed
at
meek
silence
death
poked
at
his
laptop
some
he
thought
about
writing
down
more
notes
but
that
was
probably
in
the
same
category
he
closed
his
eyes
and
now
he
felt
the
extent
of
his
injuries
felt
them
truly
for
the
first
time
since
he
woken
up
in
this
hospital
there
were
deep
grinding
pains
in
his
legs
both
knees
broken
fracture
in
the
left
thigh
his
ribs
hurt
every
time
he
breathed
his
face
was
a
ruin
his
mouth
felt
like
he
had
twisted
lumps
of
hamburger
glued
to
his
torn
lips
his
dick
well
catheterized
him
but
that
did
account
for
the
feelings
down
there
he
been
kicked
repeatedly
and
viciously
and
they
told
him
that
the
reconstructive
surgeries
surgeries
plural
would
take
some
time
and
nothing
was
certain
until
they
were
done
he
managed
to
pretend
that
his
body
was
there
for
so
long
as
he
was
able
to
poke
at
the
computer
now
it
came
back
to
him
he
had
the
painkiller
and
the
pain
was
any
worse
than
what
passed
for
normal
but
he
had
an
idea
that
if
he
hit
it
enough
times
he
be
able
to
get
away
from
his
body
for
a
while
again
he
tried
it
hilda
and
lester
sat
uncomfortably
on
the
sofa
next
to
each
other
perry
had
hoped
they
hit
it
off
but
it
was
clear
after
lester
tried
his
yoko
joke
again
that
the
chemistry
was
there
now
they
were
having
a
rare
moment
of
the
tv
switched
on
like
in
an
old
comedy
no
one
looking
at
their
own
laptop
the
tension
was
thick
and
perry
was
sick
of
it
he
reached
for
his
computer
and
asked
it
to
find
him
the
baseball
gloves
two
of
the
drawers
on
the
walls
glowed
pink
he
fetched
the
gloves
down
tossed
one
to
lester
and
picked
up
his
ball
come
on
he
said
tv
is
historically
accurate
but
it
not
very
social
lester
got
up
from
the
sofa
a
slow
smile
spreading
on
his
face
and
hilda
followed
a
minute
later
outside
by
the
cracked
pool
it
was
coming
on
slow
twilight
and
that
magic
tropical
sky
like
a
swirl
of
sorbet
lester
and
perry
each
put
on
their
gloves
perry
worn
his
now
and
again
but
had
never
had
a
real
game
of
catch
with
it
lester
lobbed
an
easy
toss
to
him
and
when
it
smacked
his
glove
it
felt
so
the
sound
and
the
vibration
and
the
fine
cloud
of
dust
that
rose
up
from
the
mitt
pocket
christ
it
was
like
a
sacrament
he
could
lob
the
ball
back
because
of
his
busted
wing
so
he
handed
the
ball
to
hilda
you
my
designated
right
arm
he
said
she
smiled
and
chucked
the
ball
back
to
lester
they
played
until
the
twilight
deepened
to
velvety
warm
dark
and
humming
bugs
and
starlight
each
time
he
caught
a
ball
something
left
perry
some
pain
long
held
in
his
chest
evanesced
into
the
night
air
his
catching
arm
stiff
from
being
twisted
by
the
weight
of
the
cast
on
his
other
hand
unlimbered
and
became
fluid
his
mind
was
becalmed
none
of
them
talked
though
they
sometimes
laughed
when
a
ball
went
wild
and
both
perry
and
lester
went
ooh
when
lester
made
a
that
nearly
tumbled
him
into
the
dry
pool
perry
had
played
a
game
of
catch
since
he
was
a
kid
catch
his
dad
strong
suit
and
he
and
his
friends
had
liked
better
than
tossing
a
ball
which
was
pretty
dull
by
comparison
but
that
night
it
was
magic
and
when
it
got
to
full
dark
and
they
could
barely
see
the
ball
except
as
a
second
moon
hurtling
white
through
the
air
they
kept
tossing
it
a
few
more
times
before
perry
dropped
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
baggy
shorts
let
get
a
drink
he
said
lester
came
over
and
gave
him
a
big
bearish
hug
then
hilda
joined
them
you
stink
lester
said
seriously
dude
like
the
ass
of
a
dead
bear
that
broke
them
up
and
set
them
to
laughing
together
a
giggling
fit
that
left
them
gasping
lester
on
all
fours
perry
arm
forgot
to
hurt
and
he
moved
to
kiss
hilda
on
the
cheek
and
instead
she
turned
her
head
to
kiss
him
full
on
the
lips
a
real
juicy
steamy
one
that
made
his
melt
drinks
hilda
said
breaking
the
kiss
they
went
upstairs
holding
the
mitts
and
had
a
beer
together
on
the
patio
talking
softly
about
nothing
in
particular
and
then
lester
hugged
them
good
night
and
then
they
all
went
to
bed
and
perry
put
his
face
into
the
hair
at
the
back
of
hilda
neck
and
told
her
he
loved
her
and
hilda
snuggled
up
to
him
and
they
fell
asleep
a
game
of
catch
your
empire
is
crumbling
around
your
ears
your
supporters
are
hospitalized
by
jackboot
thugs
for
sticking
up
for
you
the
lawsuits
are
mounting
and
mbas
have
determined
to
use
your
ride
project
to
get
right
by
embarking
on
years
of
litigation
what
do
you
do
well
if
you
like
perry
gibbons
lester
banks
and
hilda
hammersen
you
go
out
into
the
backyard
and
throw
a
ball
around
for
a
while
then
you
have
a
big
cuddle
and
head
inside
the
pictures
shown
here
were
captured
by
a
neighbor
of
the
cult
leaders
last
night
at
their
palatial
condos
in
hollywood
florida
the
three
are
of
the
organization
that
manages
the
rides
that
dot
ten
cities
in
america
and
are
present
in
fifty
cities
in
brazil
their
project
came
to
national
attention
when
disney
brought
suit
against
them
securing
injunctions
against
the
rides
that
resulted
in
riots
and
bloodshed
one
supporter
of
the
group
the
outspoken
death
waits
a
former
disney
employee
has
been
hospitalized
for
over
a
week
following
a
savage
beating
that
he
claims
resulted
from
his
internet
posting
about
the
unhealthy
obsession
disney
executive
samuel
page
see
previous
coverage
bore
for
the
ride
everyone
needs
to
unwind
now
and
then
but
sources
at
the
hospital
where
death
waits
lies
abed
say
that
he
has
had
no
visits
from
the
cult
leaders
since
he
took
his
beating
in
their
service
no
doubt
these
three
have
more
important
things
to
do
like
play
catch
suzanne
said
look
you
ca
let
crazy
people
set
your
agenda
if
you
want
to
visit
this
death
kid
you
should
if
you
do
you
should
but
do
let
freddy
you
into
doing
something
you
do
want
to
do
maybe
he
does
have
a
rat
in
your
building
maybe
he
got
a
rat
at
the
hospital
maybe
though
he
just
scored
some
stills
off
a
flickr
stream
maybe
he
watching
new
photos
with
some
stuff
perry
looked
up
from
his
screen
still
scowling
people
do
that
sure
stalkerware
i
use
it
myself
just
to
see
what
photos
of
me
are
showing
up
online
i
scour
every
published
for
anything
that
appears
to
be
a
photo
of
me
most
of
it
from
blogjects
cctv
cameras
and
crap
like
that
you
should
see
what
it
like
on
days
i
go
to
london
you
can
get
photographed
times
a
day
there
without
trying
so
yeah
if
i
was
freddy
and
i
wanted
to
screw
with
you
be
watching
every
image
feed
for
your
pic
and
mine
and
lester
we
just
need
to
assume
that
that
going
on
but
look
at
what
he
actually
reported
on
you
went
out
and
played
catch
and
then
hugged
after
your
game
it
not
like
he
caught
you
cornholing
gators
while
smoking
spliffs
rolled
in
what
does
that
guy
have
against
us
anyway
suzanne
sighed
well
at
first
i
think
it
was
that
liked
you
and
that
you
were
trying
to
do
something
consistent
with
what
he
thought
everyone
should
be
doing
after
all
if
anyone
were
to
follow
his
exhortations
they
have
to
be
dumb
enough
to
be
taking
him
seriously
and
for
that
they
deserve
all
possible
disapprobation
these
days
though
he
hates
you
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
that
you
failed
which
means
that
you
got
to
have
some
kind
of
moral
deficiency
the
second
is
that
we
keep
pulling
his
pants
down
in
public
which
makes
him
even
angrier
since
pulling
down
pants
is
job
i
know
it
armchair
psychology
but
i
think
that
freddy
just
like
himself
very
much
at
the
end
of
the
day
people
who
are
secure
and
happy
do
act
like
this
perry
scowl
deepened
i
like
to
kick
him
in
the
fucking
balls
he
said
why
ca
he
just
let
us
be
we
got
enough
frigging
problems
i
just
want
to
go
and
visit
this
kid
lester
said
and
they
were
back
where
they
started
but
we
know
that
this
freddy
guy
has
an
informant
in
the
hospital
he
about
says
as
much
in
this
article
if
we
go
there
he
wins
perry
said
hilda
and
lester
just
looked
at
him
finally
he
smiled
and
relented
ok
freddy
is
going
to
run
my
life
if
it
the
right
thing
to
visit
this
kid
it
the
right
thing
let
do
it
we
go
after
the
ride
shuts
tonight
lester
said
all
of
us
buy
him
a
fruit
basket
and
bring
him
a
mini
the
minis
were
latest
mechanical
computers
built
inside
of
sardine
cans
made
of
miniaturized
printed
alloys
they
could
add
and
subtract
numbers
up
to
ten
using
a
hand
crank
on
the
side
registering
their
output
on
a
binary
display
of
little
windows
that
were
covered
and
uncovered
by
tiny
shutters
he
built
his
first
the
day
before
using
designs
supplied
by
some
of
his
people
in
brazil
and
tweaking
them
to
his
liking
the
day
was
as
close
to
a
normal
day
on
the
ride
as
perry
could
imagine
the
crowd
was
heavy
from
the
moment
he
opened
and
he
had
to
go
back
into
the
depths
and
kick
things
back
into
shape
a
couple
times
and
one
of
the
chairs
shut
down
and
two
of
the
merchants
had
a
dispute
that
degenerated
into
a
brawl
just
another
day
running
a
roadside
attraction
in
florida
lester
spelled
him
off
for
the
end
of
the
day
then
they
counted
the
take
and
said
good
night
to
the
merchants
and
all
piled
into
one
of
lester
cars
and
headed
for
the
hospital
you
liking
florida
lester
called
over
the
seat
as
they
inched
forward
in
the
commuter
traffic
on
the
way
into
melbourne
it
hot
i
like
that
hilda
said
you
did
mention
the
awesome
aesthetics
lester
said
suzanne
rolled
her
eyes
chic
she
said
i
love
it
here
lester
said
that
contrast
between
crass
overdeveloped
cheap
nasty
and
unspoiled
tropical
beauty
it
gorgeous
it
tickles
my
funny
bone
hilda
squinted
out
the
window
as
though
she
were
trying
to
see
what
lester
saw
like
someone
staring
at
a
stereogram
in
a
trying
to
make
the
image
pop
out
if
you
say
so
she
said
i
do
find
much
attractive
about
human
settlement
though
if
it
needs
to
be
there
it
should
just
be
invisible
as
possible
we
fundamentally
live
in
ugly
boxes
and
efforts
to
make
them
pretty
never
do
anything
for
me
except
call
attention
to
how
ugly
they
are
i
kinda
wish
that
everything
was
built
to
disappear
as
much
as
possible
so
we
could
concentrate
on
the
loveliness
of
the
world
you
get
that
in
madison
lester
said
nope
she
said
i
never
seen
any
place
designed
the
way
design
one
maybe
i
do
that
someday
perry
loved
her
just
then
for
that
the
casual
oh
yeah
the
world
is
arranged
to
my
satisfaction
maybe
i
rearrange
it
someday
the
was
a
bored
eastern
european
who
gave
them
a
hard
time
about
having
too
many
people
visit
death
waits
all
at
once
but
who
melted
when
suzanne
gave
her
a
little
talk
in
russian
what
was
that
all
about
perry
whispered
to
her
as
they
made
their
way
along
the
ward
told
her
we
would
keep
it
down
and
complimented
her
on
her
manicure
lester
shook
his
head
i
have
been
in
a
place
like
this
in
so
long
the
fatkins
places
are
nothing
like
it
hilda
snorted
more
upscale
i
take
it
lester
and
hilda
really
talked
about
the
fatkins
thing
but
perry
suddenly
remembered
the
vehemence
with
which
hilda
had
denounced
the
kids
who
were
talked
into
fatkins
treatments
in
their
teens
and
wondered
if
she
and
lester
should
be
clearing
the
air
not
really
but
more
functional
more
about
i
do
know
pursuing
your
hobby
less
about
showing
up
in
an
emergency
hilda
snorted
again
and
they
were
at
death
room
they
walked
past
his
roommates
an
old
lady
with
her
teeth
out
sleeping
with
her
jaw
sagging
down
and
a
man
in
a
hammering
on
a
controller
and
staring
fixedly
at
the
screen
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
then
they
came
upon
death
waits
perry
had
only
seen
him
briefly
and
in
bad
shape
even
then
but
now
he
was
a
wreck
something
from
a
horror
movie
or
an
atrocity
photo
perry
swallowed
hard
as
he
took
in
the
boy
wracked
skinny
body
the
casts
the
sunken
eyes
the
shaved
head
the
face
and
torn
ears
he
was
fixedly
watching
tv
which
seemed
to
be
showing
a
golf
show
his
thumb
was
poised
over
a
connected
to
the
iv
in
his
arm
death
looked
at
them
with
dull
eyes
at
first
not
recognizing
them
for
a
moment
then
he
did
and
his
eyes
welled
up
with
tears
they
streamed
down
his
face
and
his
chin
and
lip
quivered
and
then
he
opened
his
mouth
and
started
to
bawl
like
a
baby
perry
was
paralyzed
transfixed
by
this
crying
wreck
lester
too
and
suzanne
they
all
took
a
minute
step
backward
but
hilda
pushed
past
them
and
took
his
hand
and
stroked
his
hair
and
went
his
bawling
become
more
uncontrolled
louder
and
his
two
roommates
complained
calling
to
him
to
shut
up
and
suzanne
moved
back
and
drew
the
curtains
around
each
of
their
beds
strangely
this
silenced
them
gradually
death
cries
became
softer
and
then
he
snuffled
and
snorted
and
hilda
gave
him
a
kleenex
from
her
purse
he
wiped
his
face
and
blew
his
nose
and
squeezed
the
kleenex
tight
in
his
hand
he
opened
his
mouth
shut
it
opened
and
shut
it
then
in
a
whisper
he
told
them
his
story
the
man
in
the
and
his
erection
the
hospital
posting
on
the
message
boards
the
lawyer
perry
said
loud
enough
that
they
all
jumped
and
death
waits
flinched
pathetically
in
his
hospital
bed
hilda
squeezed
his
arm
hard
sorry
sorry
perry
muttered
but
this
lawyer
what
did
he
say
to
you
perry
listened
for
a
time
death
waits
spoke
in
a
low
monotone
pausing
frequently
to
draw
in
shuddering
breaths
that
were
almost
sobs
fucking
perry
said
evil
corporate
immoral
sleazy
hilda
squeezed
his
arm
again
shh
she
said
take
it
easy
upsetting
him
perry
was
so
angry
he
could
barely
see
barely
think
he
was
trembling
and
they
were
all
staring
at
him
but
he
stop
death
had
shrunk
back
into
himself
squeezed
his
eyes
shut
i
be
back
in
a
minute
perry
said
he
felt
like
he
was
suffocating
he
walked
out
of
the
room
so
fast
it
was
practically
a
jog
then
pounded
on
the
elevator
buttons
waited
ten
seconds
and
gave
up
and
ran
down
ten
flights
of
stairs
he
got
outside
into
the
coolness
of
the
hazy
night
and
sucked
in
huge
lungsful
of
wet
air
his
heart
hammering
in
his
chest
he
had
his
phone
in
his
hand
and
he
had
scrolled
to
number
but
he
kept
himself
from
dialing
it
he
was
in
no
shape
to
discuss
this
with
kettlewell
he
wanted
witnesses
there
when
he
did
it
to
keep
him
from
doing
something
stupid
he
went
back
inside
the
security
guards
watched
him
closely
but
he
forced
himself
to
smile
and
act
calm
and
they
did
stop
him
from
boarding
the
elevator
i
sorry
he
said
to
all
of
them
i
sorry
he
said
to
death
waits
let
me
make
something
very
very
clear
you
are
free
to
use
the
internet
as
much
as
you
want
you
are
free
to
tell
your
story
to
anyone

want
to
tell
it
to
even
if
it
screws
up
my
case
free
to
do
that
you
given
up
enough
for
me
already
death
looked
at
him
with
watery
eyes
really
he
said
it
came
out
in
a
hoarse
whisper
perry
moved
the
breakfast
tray
that
covered
death
laptop
then
opened
the
laptop
and
positioned
it
where
death
could
reach
it
all
yours
buddy
whatever
you
want
to
say
say
it
let
your
freak
flag
fly
death
cried
again
then
silent
tears
slipping
down
his
hollow
cheeks
perry
got
him
some
kleenex
from
the
bathroom
and
he
blew
his
nose
and
wiped
his
face
and
grinned
at
them
all
a
toothless
wet
ruined
smile
that
made
perry
heart
lurch
jesus
jesus
jesus
what
the
hell
was
he
doing
this
kid
he
would
never
get
the
life

said

grateful
to
me

said

owe
you

thanks

here

that

have
done

shantytown

suzanne

perry
said
he
can
go
fuck
himself
imagineering

the
prototype
up
to
sammy
as
soon
as
it
was
ready
the
actual
engineers
who
been
working
on
it
shlepping
it
into
his
office
he
been
careful
to
cultivate
their
friendship
through
the
weeks
of
production
taking
them
out
for
beers
and
delicately
letting
them
know
that
they
were
just
the
sort
of
people
who
really
understood
what
disney
parks
was
about
not
like
those
philistines
who
comprised
the
rest
of
the
management
layer
at
disney
he
learned
their
kids
names
and
forwarded
jokes
to
them
by
email
he
dropped
by
their
and
let
them
beat
him
at
pinball
on
their
gigantic
bizarre
homebrew
machine
letting
them
know
just
how
cool
said
machine
was
now
it
was
paying
off
judging
from
the
device
he
was
looking
at
a
smooth
box
that
it
took
two
of
them
to
carry
in
watch
this
one
of
them
said
he
knocked
a
complicated
pattern
on
the
box
top
and
a
hidden
hatch
opened
out
of
the
side
yawning
out
and
forming
a
miniature
staircase
from
halfway
down
the
box
surface
to
the
ground
there
was
soft
music
playing
inside
the
box
a
jazzy
uptempo
futuristic
version
of
you
wish
upon
a
a
little
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
looked
like
he
was
made
of
and
he
took
the
stairs
in
three
wobbling
strides
he
ignored
them
as
he
lurched
around
the
box
perimeter
until
he
came
to
a
far
corner
then
another
hatch
slid
away
and
the
little
man
reached
inside
and
tugged
out
the
plug
and
the
end
of
the
he
hugged
the
plug
to
his
chest
and
began
to
wander
around
sammy
desk
clearly
looking
for
an
electrical
outlet
it
a
search
algorithm
one
of
the
imagineers
said
watch
this
after
a
couple
of
circuits
of
sammy
desk
the
little
robot
went
to
the
edge
and
jumped
hanging
on
to
the
which
unspooled
slowly
from
the
box
like
a
gently
lowering
the
man
to
the
ground
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
found
the
electrical
outlet
and
plugged
in
the
box
the
music
inside
stilled
and
a
fanfare
began
the
trumpeting
reached
a
joyous
peak
it
found
a
network
connection
and
then
subsided
into
music
there
was
a
smell
like
in
the
microwave
a
moment
later
another
man
emerged
from
the
box
lugging
a
chunk
of
plastic
that
looked
like
the
base
of
a
rocket
in
an
science
fiction
movie
the
first
man
was
shinnying
up
the
power
cable
he
crested
the
desktop
and
joined
his
brother
in
ferrying
out
more
parts
each
one
snapped
into
the
previous
one
with
a
taking
shape
on
the
desktop
in
slow
stages
the
original
tomorrowland
complete
with
the
rocket
to
the
moon
the
clock
of
the
world
and
dairy
farmers
of
america
present
the
cow
of
tomorrow
sammy
said
peering
at
the
little
brass
plaque
on
the
diorama
which
showed
a
cow
with
an
iv
in
her
hock
watching
a
video
of
a
pasture
you
kidding
me
no
one
imagineer
said
it
all
for
real
the
archives
have
all
these
tight
models
of
all
the
rides
the
park
ever
seen
this
is
totally
historically
accurate
the
kaiser
aluminum
hall
of
fame
the
monsanto
hall
of
chemistry
thimble
drome
flight
circle
with
tiny
flying
miniature
airplanes
holy
crap
sammy
said
people
to
see
these
things
go
on
the
other
imagineer
said
take
the
roof
off
the
hall
of
chemistry
sammy
did
and
was
treated
to
a
tiny
incredibly
detailed
model
of
the
hall
interior
exhibits
complete
with
tiny
people
in
garb
marveling
at
the
truly
crappy
exhibits
we
print
to
dpi
with
these
we
can
put
pupils
on
the
eyeballs
at
that
rez
the
pieces
were
still
trundling
out
sammy
picked
up
the
monsanto
hall
of
chemistry
and
turned
it
over
and
over
in
his
hands
looking
at
the
minute
detail
admiring
the
way
all
the
pieces
snapped
together
it
kind
of
brittle
the
first
imagineer
said
he
took
it
from
sammy
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
and
it
cracked
with
a
noise
like
an
office
chair
rolling
over
a
sheet
of
the
pieces
fell
to
the
desk
a
man
happened
upon
a
shard
after
a
moment
and
hugged
it
to
his
chest
then
toddled
back
into
the
box
with
it
there
a
little
optical
scanner
in
there
it
figure
out
which
bit
this
piece
came
from
and
print
another
one
total
construction
of
this
model
takes
about
two
hours
you
built
this
entire
thing
from
scratch
in
three
weeks
the
imagineers
laughed
no
no
no
way
no
almost
all
the
code
and
designs
came
off
the
net
most
of
this
stuff
was
developed
by
new
work
startups
back
in
the
day
or
by
those
ride
weirdos
down
in
hollywood
we
just
shoved
it
all
into
this
box
and
added
the
models
for
some
of
our
old
rides
from
the
archives
this
was
easy
man
easy
sammy
head
swam
easy
this
thing
was
undeniably
he
wanted
one
everyone
was
going
to
want
one
you
can
print
these
as
big
as
you
want
too
if
we
gave
it
enough
time
space
and
feedstock
it
run
these
buildings
at
full
size
the
miniature
tomorrowland
was
nearly
done
it
was
all
brave
sad
white
curves
like
the
set
of
a
remake
of
rollerball
and
featured
tiny
people
in
clothes
and
salaryman
hats
glasses
and
scout
uniforms
for
the
boys
sammy
goggled
at
it
he
moved
the
little
people
around
lifted
off
the
lids
man
i
seen
the
models
and
flythroughs
but
they
nothing
compared
to
actually
seeing
it
owning
it
people
will
want
libraries
of
these
things
whole
rooms
devoted
to
them
umm
one
of
the
imagineers
said
sammy
knew
his
name
but
forgotten
it
he
had
a
whole
complicated
scheme
for
remembering
people
names
by
making
up
stories
about
them
but
it
was
a
lot
of
work
well
about
that
this
feedstock
is
very
but
it
does
really
weather
well
even
if
you
stored
it
in
a
dark
room
it
start
to
delaminate
and
fall
to
pieces
within
a
month
or
two
leave
it
in
the
living
room
in
direct
sunlight
and
it
crumble
within
a
couple
days
sammy
pursed
his
lips
and
thought
for
a
while
please
please
tell
me
that
there
something
proprietary
we
can
require
in
the
feedstock
that
can
make
us
into
the
sole
supplier
of
consumables
for
this
thing
maybe
we
could
certainly
tag
the
goop
with
something
proprietary
and
hunt
for
it
when
we
do
the
build
refuse
to
run
on
anyone
goop
of
course
that
wo
be
hard
to
defeat
we
sue
anyone
who
tries
it
sammy
said
oh
boys
you
outdone
yourselves
seriously
if
i
could
give
you
a
raise
i
would
as
it
is
take
something
home
from
the
architectural
salvage
lot
and
sell
it
on
ebay
it
as
close
to
a
bonus
as
this
fucking
company
going
to
pay
any
of
us
they
looked
at
him
quizzically
with
some
alarm
and
he
smiled
and
spread
his
hands
ha
ha
only
serious
boys
really
take
some
stuff
home
you
earned
it
try
and
grab
something
from
the
itself
that
got
the
highest
they
left
behind
a
slim
folder
with
production
notes
and
estimates
suppliers
who
would
be
likely
to
bid
on
a
job
like
this
he
need
a
marketing
plan
too
but
this
was
farther
than
he
ever
thought
get
he
could
show
this
to
legal
and
to
the
board
and
yes
to
wiener
and
the
rest
of
the
useless
committee
he
could
get
everyone
lined
up
behind
this
and
working
on
it
hell
if
he
spun
it
right
they
all
be
fighting
to
have
their
pet
projects
instantiated
with
it
he
fiddled
with
a
couple
of
overnight
shippers
sites
for
a
while
trying
to
figure
out
what
it
would
cost
to
sell
these
in
the
park
and
have
them
waiting
on
the
marks
doorsteps
when
they
got
back
home
there
were
lots
of
little
details
like
that
but
ultimately
this
was
good
and
clean
it
would
extend
the
parks
reach
right
into
the
living
rooms
of
their
customers
giving
them
a
new
reason
to
think
of
the
park
every
day
kettlewell
and
tjan
looked
up
when
perry
banged
through
the
door
of
the
they
turned
into
their
de
facto
headquarters
perry
had
gone
through
mad
and
back
to
calm
on
the
ride
home
but
as
he
drew
closer
to
the
passing
the
people
in
the
streets
the
people
living
their
lives
without
lawyers
or
bullshit
his
anger
came
back
he
even
stopped
outside
the
and
breathed
deeply
but
his
heart
was
pounding
and
his
hands
kept
balling
into
fists
and
sometimes
man
sometimes
you
just
got
to
go
for
it
he
got
to
the
table
and
grabbed
the
papers
there
and
tossed
them
over
his
shoulder
you
fired
he
said
pack
up
and
go
i
want
you
out
by
morning
you
done
here
you
do
represent
the
ride
and
you
never
will
get
lost
he
did
know
he
was
going
to
say
it
until
he
said
it
but
it
felt
right
this
was
what
he
was
feeling
project
had
been
stolen
and
bad
things
were
being
done
in
name
and
it
was
going
to
stop
right
now
tjan
and
kettlewell
got
to
their
feet
and
looked
at
him
faces
blank
with
shock
kettlewell
recovered
first
perry
let
sit
down
and
do
an
exit
interview
all
right
that
traditional
perry
was
shaking
with
anger
now
these
two
friends
of
his
fucking
screwed
him
committed
their
dirty
work
in
his
name
but
kettlewell
was
holding
a
chair
out
to
him
and
the
others
in
the
were
staring
and
he
thought
about
eva
and
the
kids
and
the
baseball
gloves
and
he
sat
down
he
squeezed
his
thighs
hard
with
his
clenching
hands
drew
in
a
deep
breath
and
recited
what
death
waits
had
told
him
in
an
even
wooden
voice
so
that
it
i
do
know
if
you
instructed
the
lawyers
to
do
this
or
only
just
distanced
yourself
enough
from
them
to
let
them
do
this
on
their
own
the
point
is
that
the
way
you
running
this
campaign
is
victimizing
people
who
believe
in
us
making
life
worse
for
people
who
already
got
a
shitty
shitty
deal
on
our
account
i
wo
have
it
kettlewell
and
tjan
looked
at
each
other
they
both
stayed
through
perry
accusation
and
now
kettlewell
made
a
little
gesture
at
tjan
there
no
excuse
for
what
that
lawyer
did
we
did
authorize
it
we
did
know
it
had
happened
and
we
would
have
permitted
it
if
we
had
in
a
suit
like
this
there
are
a
lot
of
moving
parts
and
there
no
way
to
keep
track
of
all
of
them
all
of
the
time
you
know
what
every
ride
operator
in
the
world
is
up
to
you
do
even
know
where
all
the
rides
in
the
world
that
in
the
nature
of
a
decentralized
business
but
here
the
thing
the
lawyer
was
at
least
partly
right
everything
that
kid
blogs
emails
and
says
will
potentially
end
up
in
the
public
record
like
it
or
not
that
kid
can
no
longer
consider
himself
to
have
a
private
life
not
until
the
court
case
is
up
neither
can
you
or
i
for
that
matter
that
in
the
nature
of
a
lawsuit
and
it
not
something
any
of
us
can
change
at
this
point
perry
heard
him
as
from
a
great
distance
through
the
whooshing
of
the
blood
in
his
ears
he
could
think
of
anything
to
say
to
that
tjan
and
kettlewell
looked
at
each
other
so
even
if
we
tjan
said
at
last
making
sarcastic
this
problem
wo
go
away
we
floated
the
syndicate
and
given
control
of
the
legal
case
to
them
if
you
try
to
ditch
it
you
going
to
have
to
contend
with
lawsuits
too
i
did
perry
started
but
he
had
he
signed
all
kinds
of
papers
first
papers
that
incorporated
the
and
second
papers
that
gave
legal
representation
over
to
the
syndicate
perry
i
the
chairman
of
the
boston
ride
collective
i
their
rep
on
the
board
you
ca
fire
me
you
did
hire
me
they
did
so
stop
breathing
through
your
nose
like
a
locomotive
and
calm
down
none
of
us
wanted
that
lawyer
to
go
after
that
kid
he
knew
they
were
making
sense
but
he
did
want
to
care
he
ended
up
in
this
place
because
these
supposed
pals
of
his
had
screwed
up
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
end
up
making
up
with
them
going
to
end
up
getting
deeper
into
this
he
knew
that
this
was
how
good
people
did
shitty
things
one
tiny
rotten
compromise
at
a
time
well
he
going
to
go
there
tomorrow
morning
he
said
gone
we
can
figure
out
by
email
how
to
have
a
smooth
transition
but
no
more
of
this
not
on
my
head
not
on
my
account
he
stalked
away
which
is
what
he
should
have
done
in
the
first
place
fuck
being
reasonable
reasonable
sucked
death
found
out
about
the
printers
seconds
after
they
were
announced
he
been
tuning
his
to
give
him
news
about
the
disney
parks
for
nearly
a
decade
and
this
little
pr
item
on
the
disney
parks
newswire
rang
all
the
cherries
on
his
filters
flagging
the
item
red
and
rocketing
it
to
the
top
of
his
news
playlist
making
all
the
icons
in
the
sides
of
his
screen
bounce
with
delight
the
announcement
made
him
want
to
throw
up
they
were
totally
ripping
off
the
rides
and
he
knew
for
a
fact
that
most
of
the
meshes
of
the
old
yesterland
rides
and
even
the
contemporary
ones
were
so
those
be
ripped
off
too
and
the
worst
part
was
he
could
feel
himself
getting
excited
this
was
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
have
given
him
major
fanboy
drool
as
recently
as
a
month
ago
he
just
stared
angrily
at
his
screen
being
angry
made
the
painkillers
wear
off
so
the
madder
he
got
the
more
he
hurt
he
could
nail
the
and
dose
himself
with
more
of
whatever
the
painkiller
plugged
into
his
iv
was
today
but
since
perry
and
lester
and
their
girlfriends
had
that
other
one
been
suzanne
church
it
sure
looked
like
her
had
told
him
he
could
use
his
laptop
again
he
stayed
off
the
juice
as
much
as
possible
the
computer
could
make
him
forget
he
hurt
he
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
the
blinds
on
the
ward
were
shut
most
of
the
time
and
he
kept
to
his
own
schedule
napping
and
then
surfing
then
nodding
off
and
then
surfing
some
more
the
hospital
staff
just
left
his
food
on
the
table
beside
him
if
he
was
asleep
when
it
arrived
though
they
woke
him
for
his
sponge
baths
and
to
stick
fresh
needles
in
his
arms
which
were
filled
with
bruisey
collapsed
veins
there
was
no
one
he
could
tell
about
this
sure
there
were
with
chatter
from
disney
freaks
but
he
did
much
want
to
chat
with
them
some
of
his
friends
would
still
be
up
and
tweaking
but
christ
who
wanted
to
im
with
a
speed
freak
at
four
in
the
morning
his
typing
was
down
to
less
than
wpm
and
he
could
keep
it
up
for
long
what
he
really
wanted
was
to
talk
to
someone
about
this
he
really
wanted
to
talk
to
perry
about
this
he
should
send
him
an
email
but
he
had
the
inkling
of
an
idea
and
he
did
want
to
put
it
in
writing
because
it
was
a
deliciously
naughty
idea
it
was
dumb
to
even
think
about
phoning
him
he
barely
knew
him
and
no
one
liked
to
get
calls
at
four
am
besides
he
checked
perry
number
was
unlisted
from
deathw
to
pgibbons
subject
your
phone
number
perry
i
know
that
it
presumptuous
but
i
really
like
to
talk
to
you
about
something
important
that
i
prefer
not
to
put
in
writing
i
do
have
any
right
to
impose
on
you
especially
not
after
you
already
done
me
the
kindness
of
coming
to
see
me
in
the
hospital
but
i
hope
you
send
me
your
number
anyway
alternatively
please
call
me
on
my
enum
your
admirer
death
waits
it
was
five
minutes
later
when
his
laptop
rang
it
was
unnaturally
loud
on
the
ward
and
he
heard
his
roommates
stir
when
the
tone
played
he
did
have
a
headset
christ
he
was
an
idiot
wait
there
was
one
dangling
from
the
tv
no
mic
but
at
least
he
could
pair
it
with
his
laptop
for
sound
he
stabbed
at
the
mute
button
and
reached
for
the
headset
and
slipped
it
on
then
he
held
the
computer
close
to
his
face
and
whispered
hello
into
its
little
mic
his
voice
was
a
croak
his
ruined
mouth
distorting
the
word
why
had
he
decided
to
call
this
guy
he
was
such
an
idiot
this
is
perry
gibbons
is
that
death
waits
yes
sorry
i
do
have
a
mic
can
you
hear
me
ok
if
i
turn
the
volume
all
the
way
up
i
can
there
was
an
awkward
silence
death
tried
to
think
of
how
to
begin
what
on
your
mind
death
i
did
expect
you
to
be
awake
at
this
hour
i
had
a
rough
night
perry
said
it
occurred
to
death
that
he
was
talking
to
one
of
his
heros
a
man
who
had
come
to
visit
him
in
the
hospital
that
day
he
grew
even
more
what
happened
nothing
important
perry
said
and
swallowed
and
death
suddenly
understood
that
perry
had
had
a
rough
night
because
of
because
of
what
told
perry
it
made
him
want
to
cry
i
sorry
death
said
what
on
your
mind
death
perry
said
again
death
told
him
what
he
found
about
the
disney
printers
he
read
perry
the
urls
so
he
could
look
them
up
ok
that
interesting
perry
said
death
could
tell
he
really
think
it
was
that
interesting
i
have
told
you
my
idea
yet
he
groped
for
the
words
his
mouth
had
gone
dry
ok
so
disney
going
to
ship
these
things
to
tons
of
people
houses
they
sell
them
cheap
at
the
parks
and
mail
them
as
freebies
to
magic
kingdom
club
holders
so
in
a
week
or
two
there
going
to
be
just
you
know
tons
of
these
across
the
country
right
so
here
my
idea
what
if
you
could
get
them
to
build
stuff
what
if
you
could
send
them
plans
for
stuff
from
the
rides
what
if
you
could
just
download
your
friends
designs
what
if
this
was
opened
wide
perry
chuckled
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
then
laughed
and
full
of
merriment
i
like
the
way
you
think
kid
he
said
once
he
caught
his
breath
and
then
this
amazing
thing
happened
perry
gibbons
with
him
about
the
kinds
of
designs
they
could
push
out
to
these
things
it
was
like
some
kind
of
awesome
dream
come
true
perry
was
treating
him
like
a
peer
loving
his
ideas
keying
off
of
them
then
a
dismal
thought
struck
him
wait
though
wait
they
using
their
own
goop
for
the
printers
every
design
we
print
makes
them
richer
perry
laughed
again
really
merry
oh
that
kind
of
thing
never
works
they
been
trying
to
tie
feedstock
to
printers
since
the
inkjet
days
we
go
through
that
like
wet
kleenex
is
that
illegal
who
the
fuck
knows
it
should
be
i
do
care
about
illegal
anymore
legal
gets
you
lawyers
come
on
dude
what
the
point
of
being
all
into
some
subculture
if
you
spend
all
your
time
sucking
up
to
the
authorities
death
laughed
which
actually
hurt
quite
a
bit
it
was
the
first
laugh
he
had
since
he
ended
up
in
the
hospital
maybe
the
first
one
since
he
been
fired
from
disney
world
and
as
much
as
it
hurt
it
felt
good
too
like
a
band
being
loosened
from
around
his
broken
ribs
his
roommates
stirred
and
one
of
them
must
have
pushed
the
nurse
call
button
because
shortly
thereafter
the
formidable
ukrainian
nurse
came
in
and
savagely
told
him
off
for
disturbing
the
ward
at
five
in
the
morning
perry
heard
and
said
his
goodbyes
like
they
were
old
pals
who
chatted
too
long
and
death
waits
rang
off
and
fell
into
a
light
doze
grinning
like
a
maniac
hilda
eyed
perry
curiously
that
sounded
like
an
interesting
conversation
she
said
she
was
wearing
a
long
of
his
that
did
really
cover
much
and
she
looked
delicious
in
it
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
grabbing
her
and
tossing
her
on
the
bed
of
course
the
cast
meant
that
he
could
really
do
that
and
hilda
was
exactly
smiling
either
sorry
i
did
mean
to
wake
you
up
he
said
it
was
the
talking
that
did
it
it
was
you
not
being
there
in
the
first
place
gave
me
the
she
came
over
to
him
then
the
lean
muscles
in
her
legs
flexing
as
she
crossed
the
living
room
she
took
his
laptop
away
and
set
it
down
on
the
then
took
off
his
headset
he
was
wearing
nothing
but
boxers
and
she
reached
down
and
gave
his
dick
a
companionable
honk
before
sitting
down
next
to
him
and
giving
him
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
the
throat
and
the
lips
so
perry
she
said
looking
into
his
eyes
what
the
fuck
are
you
doing
sitting
in
the
living
room
at
am
talking
to
your
computer
and
why
did
you
come
to
bed
last
night
i
not
going
to
be
hanging
out
in
florida
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
woulda
thought
you
want
to
maximize
your
while
you
got
the
chance
she
smiled
to
let
him
know
she
was
kidding
around
but
she
was
right
of
course
i
an
idiot
hilda
i
fired
tjan
and
kettlewell
told
them
to
get
lost
i
do
know
why
you
think
that
such
a
bad
idea
you
need
probably
but
it
does
need
to
be
those
guys
sometimes
you
can
have
too
much
history
with
someone
to
work
with
him
besides
anything
can
be
you
can
change
your
mind
in
a
week
or
a
month
those
guys
are
doing
anything
special
come
back
to
you
if
you
asked
you
perry
gibbons
you
rule
dude
you
a
very
nice
person
hilda
hammersen
but
those
guys
are
running
our
legal
defense
which
we
going
to
need
because
about
to
do
something
that
bound
to
get
us
sued
again
by
the
same
pack
of
assholes
as
last
time
disney
she
snorted
have
you
ever
read
up
on
the
history
of
the
disney
company
the
old
one
the
one
walt
founded
walt
disney
just
a
racist
creep
he
was
also
a
mad
inventor
he
kept
coming
up
with
these
cool
ways
of
making
cartoons
sticking
real
people
in
them
putting
them
in
color
adding
people
loved
it
all
but
it
drove
him
out
of
business
it
was
all
too
expensive
so
he
recruited
his
brother
roy
disney
who
was
just
a
banker
to
run
the
business
roy
turned
the
business
around
watching
the
income
and
the
outgo
but
all
this
came
at
a
price
roy
wanted
to
tell
walt
how
to
run
the
business
more
to
the
point
he
wanted
to
tell
walt
that
he
could
just
spend
millions
from
the
company
coffers
on
r
d
projects
especially
not
when
the
company
was
still
figuring
out
how
to
exploit
the
r
d
project
walt
had
chased
but
it
was
walt
company
and
he
overrule
roy
and
roy
would
promise
that
it
was
going
to
put
them
in
the
poorhouse
and
then
he
figure
out
how
to
make
another
million
off
of
walt
vision
because
that
what
the
money
guy
is
supposed
to
do
then
after
the
war
walt
went
to
roy
and
said
me
million
i
going
to
build
a
and
roy
said
ca
have
it
and
what
a
walt
threatened
to
fire
roy
the
way
he
always
had
and
roy
pointed
out
that
disney
was
now
a
company
with
shareholders
who
were
going
to
let
walt
cowboy
around
and
piss
away
their
money
on
his
toys
so
how
he
get
disneyland
built
he
quit
he
started
his
own
company
wed
for
walter
elias
disney
he
poached
all
the
geniuses
away
from
the
studios
and
turned
them
into
his
and
cashed
in
his
policy
and
raised
his
own
dough
and
built
the
park
and
then
made
roy
buy
the
company
back
from
him
i
guessing
that
that
felt
pretty
good
it
sounds
like
it
must
perry
said
he
was
feeling
thoughtful
and
buzzed
from
the
sleepless
night
and
jazzed
from
his
conversation
with
death
waits
he
had
an
idea
that
they
could
push
designs
out
to
the
printers
that
were
like
the
disney
designs
but
weird
and
kinky
and
subversive
and
a
little
disturbing
i
can
understand
why
you
be
nervous
about
ditching
your
suits
but
they
just
that
suits
at
some
level
they
all
interchangeable
mercenary
parts
you
want
someone
to
watch
the
bottom
line
but
not
someone
who
run
the
show
if
that
not
these
guys
hey
cool
find
a
couple
more
suits
and
run
them
jesus
you
really
yoko
are
you
lester
was
wearing
his
boxers
and
a
bleary
grin
standing
in
the
living
room
doorway
where
hilda
had
stood
a
minute
before
it
was
past
now
and
there
were
waking
up
sounds
through
the
whole
condo
toilets
flushing
a
car
starting
down
in
the
parking
lot
good
morning
lester
hilda
said
she
smiled
when
she
said
it
no
offense
taken
all
good
all
good
you
fired
who
now
perry
lester
dug
a
pint
of
chocolate
out
of
the
freezer
and
attacked
it
with
a
ceramic
spoon
that
he
designed
specifically
for
this
purpose
i
got
rid
of
kettlewell
and
tjan
perry
said
he
was
blushing
i
would
have
talked
to
you
about
it
but
you
were
with
suzanne
i
had
to
do
it
though
i
had
to
i
hate
what
happened
to
death
waits
i
hate
that
we
got
some
of
the
blame
for
it
but
perry
tjan
and
kettlewell
are
part
of
our
outfit
it
their
show
too
you
ca
just
go
them
not
just
morally
either
legally
those
guys
own
a
piece
of
this
thing
and
they
keeping
the
lawyers
at
bay
too
they
managing
all
the
evil
shit
so
we
do
have
to
i
do
want
to
be
in
charge
of
the
evil
and
neither
do
you
and
hiring
a
new
suit
is
going
to
be
easy
they
all
predatory
they
all
have
delusions
of
grandeur
you
two
have
the
acumen
to
hire
better
representation
than
those
two
hilda
said
you
experienced
now
and
you
founded
a
movement
that
plenty
of
people
would
kill
to
be
a
part
of
you
just
need
better
management
structure
an
executive
you
can
overrule
whenever
you
need
to
a
lackey
not
a
boss
lester
acted
as
though
he
had
heard
her
i
being
pretty
mellow
about
this
buddy
i
not
making
a
big
deal
out
of
the
fact
that
you
did
this
without
consulting
me
because
i
know
how
rough
it
must
have
been
to
discover
that
this
wickedness
had
gone
down
in
our
name
and
i
might
have
done
the
same
but
it
the
cold
light
of
day
now
and
time
to
go
over
there
together
and
have
a
chat
with
tjan
and
kettlewell
and
talk
this
over
and
sort
it
out
we
ca
afford
to
burn
all
this
to
the
ground
and
start
over
now
perry
knew
it
was
reasonable
but
screw
reasonable
reasonable
was
how
good
people
ended
up
doing
wrong
sometimes
you
had
to
be
unreasonable
lester
they
violated
our
trust
it
was
their
responsibility
to
do
this
thing
and
do
it
right
they
did
do
that
they
did
look
closely
at
this
thing
so
that
they
would
have
to
put
the
brakes
on
if
it
turned
out
to
be
dirty
which
do
you
think
those
two
would
rather
have
happen
we
run
a
cool
project
that
everyone
loves
or
we
run
a
lawsuit
that
makes
ten
billion
dollars
for
their
investors
they
playing
a
different
game
from
us
and
their
victory
condition
is
ours
i
do
want
to
be
reasonable
i
want
to
do
the
right
thing
you
and
me
could
have
sold
out
a
thousand
times
over
the
years
and
made
money
instead
of
doing
good
but
we
did
we
did
because
it
better
to
be
right
than
to
be
reasonable
and
rich
you
say
we
ca
afford
to
get
rid
of
those
two
i
say
we
ca
afford
not
to
you
need
to
get
a
good
night
sleep
buddy
lester
said
he
was
blowing
through
his
nose
a
sure
sign
that
he
was
angry
it
made
perry
hackles
go
up
he
and
lester
did
fight
much
but
when
they
did
you
need
to
mellow
out
and
see
that
what
you
talking
about
is
abandoning
our
friends
kettlewell
and
tjan
to
make
our
own
egos
feel
a
little
better
you
need
to
see
that
we
risking
everything
risking
spending
our
lives
in
court
and
losing
everything
we
ever
built
a
calm
descended
on
perry
hilda
was
right
suits
were
everywhere
and
you
could
choose
your
own
you
did
need
to
let
the
roy
disneys
of
the
world
call
the
shots
i
sorry
you
feel
that
way
lester
i
hear
everything
you
saying
but
you
know
what
it
going
to
be
my
way
i
understand
that
what
i
want
to
do
is
risky
but
there
no
way
i
can
go
on
doing
what
doing
and
letting
things
get
worse
and
worse
making
a
little
compromise
here
and
there
is
how
you
end
up
selling
out
everything
that
important
we
going
to
find
other
and
we
going
to
work
with
them
to
make
a
smooth
transition
maybe
all
come
out
of
this
friends
later
on
they
want
to
do
something
different
from
what
i
want
to
do
is
all
this
was
calming
lester
down
at
all
perry
this
is
your
project
to
do
what
you
want
with
this
belongs
to
a
lot
of
us
i
did
most
of
the
work
in
there
you
did
buddy
i
get
that
if
you
want
to
stick
with
them
how
it
go
no
hard
feelings
i
go
off
and
do
my
own
thing
run
my
own
ride
people
who
want
to
connect
to
my
network
no
sweat
they
can
do
it
that
cool
we
still
be
friends
you
can
work
with
kettlewell
and
tjan
perry
could
hardly
believe
these
words
were
coming
out
of
his
mouth
they
been
buddies
forever
inseparable
hilda
took
his
hand
silently
lester
looked
at
him
with
increasing
incredulity
you
do
mean
that
lester
if
we
split
it
would
break
my
heart
there
would
be
a
day
that
went
by
from
now
to
the
end
of
time
that
i
did
regret
it
but
if
we
keep
going
down
this
path
it
going
to
cost
me
my
soul
rather
be
broke
than
evil
oh
it
felt
so
to
be
saying
this
to
finally
affirm
through
deed
and
word
that
he
was
a
good
person
who
would
put
ethics
before
greed
before
comfort
even
lester
looked
at
hilda
for
a
moment
hilda
this
is
probably
something
that
perry
and
i
should
talk
about
alone
if
you
mind
mind
lester
there
nothing
you
ca
say
in
front
of
her
lester
apparently
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
and
the
silence
made
perry
uncomfortable
lester
had
tears
in
his
eyes
and
that
hit
perry
in
the
chest
like
a
spear
his
friend
did
cry
often
he
crossed
the
room
and
hugged
lester
lester
was
wooden
and
unyielding
please
lester
please
i
hate
to
make
you
choose
but
you
have
to
choose
we
on
the
same
side
we
always
been
on
the
same
side
neither
of
us
are
the
kind
of
people
who
send
lawyers
after
kids
in
hospital
never
i
want
to
make
it
good
again
we
can
have
the
kind
of
gig
where
we
do
the
right
thing
and
the
cool
thing
come
on
lester
please
he
let
go
of
lester
lester
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
back
into
his
bedroom
perry
knew
that
that
meant
he
won
he
smiled
at
hilda
and
hugged
her
she
was
a
lot
more
fun
to
hug
than
lester
sammy
was
at
his
desk
looking
over
the
production
prototype
for
the
r
units
that
imagineering
had
dropped
off
that
morning
when
his
phone
rang
not
his
desk
phone
his
cellular
phone
with
the
number
blocked
hello
he
said
not
many
people
had
this
number
he
did
like
getting
interrupted
by
the
phone
people
who
needed
to
talk
to
him
could
talk
to
his
secretary
first
hi
sammy
have
i
caught
you
at
a
bad
time
he
could
hear
the
sneer
in
the
voice
and
then
he
could
see
the
face
that
went
with
the
sneer
freddy
shit
he
given
the
reporter
his
number
back
when
they
were
arranging
their
disastrous
it
not
a
good
time
freddy
he
said
if
you
call
my
secretary
i
just
need
a
moment
of
your
time
sir
for
a
quote
for
a
story
about
the
ride
response
to
your
printers
your
sammy
felt
his
guts
tense
up
of
course
those
ride
assholes
would
have
known
about
the
printers
that
what
were
for
somewhere
on
their
he
was
sure
that
there
was
some
discussion
of
them
he
had
had
time
to
look
for
it
though
and
he
did
want
to
use
the
disney
parks
competitive
intel
people
on
this
stuff
because
after
the
death
waits
debacle
debacle
on
debacle
ack
he
could
be
such
a
he
did
want
to
have
any
train
of
on
the
group
pointing
back
to
him
i
not
familiar
with
any
response
sammy
said
i
afraid
i
comment
oh
it
only
take
a
moment
to
explain
it
freddy
said
and
then
launched
into
a
explanation
before
sammy
could
object
they
were
delivering
their
own
models
for
the
printers
and
had
even
gotten
hold
of
one
of
the
test
units
disney
had
passed
out
last
week
they
claimed
to
have
the
goop
that
it
ran
on
so
that
anyone
goop
could
print
to
it
so
what
i
looking
for
is
a
quote
from
disney
on
this
do
you
condone
this
did
you
anticipate
it
what
if
someone
prints
an
with
it
no
one
going
to
print
a
working
with
this
sammy
said
too
brittle
manufacturing
is
already
sadly
in
great
profusion
across
our
inner
cities
anyway
as
to
the
rest
of
it
he
closed
his
eyes
and
took
a
couple
of
deep
breaths
as
to
the
rest
of
it
that
would
be
something
you
have
to
speak
to
one
of
my
legal
colleagues
about
would
you
like
me
to
put
you
through
to
them
freddy
laughed
oh
come
on
sammy
a
little
something
on
background
no
attribution
you
going
to
sue
them
have
them
beaten
up
sammy
felt
his
face
go
white
i
sure
i
do
know
what
talking
about
word
has
it
that
the
death
waits
kid
came
up
with
this
he
used
to
be
your
protege
no
and
i
hear
that
kettlewell
and
tjan
have
been
kicked
out
of
the
organization
no
one
around
to
call
the
lawyers
out
on
their
behalf
seems
like
a
golden
opportunity
to
strike
sammy
seethed
he
been
concentrating
on
making
new
stuff
great
stuff
competitive
stuff
to
be
sure
but
in
the
end
the
reason
for
making
the
devices
had
been
to
make
them
make
them
as
cool
as
he
could
imagine
to
plus
them
and
them
in
the
old
slang
of
walt
disney
making
the
thing
because
the
thing
could
be
made
and
the
world
would
be
a
more
fun
place
once
it
was
now
here
was
this
troll
egging
him
on
to
go
to
war
again
with
those
ride
to
spend
his
energies
destroying
instead
of
creating
the
worst
part
it
was
all
his
fault
he
brought
his
own
destruction
the
reporter
death
waits
even
the
lawsuit
all
the
result
of
his
bad
planning
and
dumb
decisions
god
he
was
a
total
sat
on
his
desk
humming
faintly
not
humming
like
a
fridge
hums
but
actually
humming
in
a
baritone
hum
humming
a
medley
of
songs
from
disney
movies
like
a
living
thing
every
once
in
a
while
it
would
clear
its
throat
and
mutter
and
even
snore
a
little
there
would
be
happy
rustles
and
whispered
conversations
from
within
the
guts
of
the
thing
it
was
plussed
all
the
way
to
hell
and
back
it
had
been
easy
as
more
and
more
imagineers
had
come
up
with
cool
features
to
add
to
the
firmware
contributing
them
to
the
versioning
system
and
he
been
able
to
choose
from
among
them
and
pick
the
best
of
the
lot
making
a
device
that
rivaled
walt
disneyland
itself
for
originality
excitement
and
cool
i
just
say
you
declined
to
comment
then
asshole
you
write
whatever
you
need
to
write
freddy
he
said
a
hatch
opened
a
tiny
bit
on
the
top
of
the
cube
and
a
pair
of
eyes
peered
out
then
it
slammed
shut
and
there
was
a
round
of
convincing
giggles
and
scurrying
from
within
the
box
this
could
be
huge
if
sammy
fuck
it
up
by
worrying
too
much
about
what
someone
else
was
up
to
oh
and
one
other
thing
it
looks
like
the
death
waits
kid
is
going
to
be
discharged
from
the
hospital
this
week
he
was
ready
to
leave
the
hospital
for
starters
he
could
walk
yet
and
there
were
still
times
when
he
could
barely
remember
where
he
was
and
there
was
the
problem
of
the
catheter
but
the
insurance
company
and
the
hospital
had
concurred
that
he
had
all
the
treatment
he
needed
even
if
his
doctor
had
been
able
to
look
him
in
the
eye
when
this
was
explained
and
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
home
go
away
go
anywhere
he
put
it
all
in
his
lj
the
conversation
as
best
as
he
could
remember
it
the
way
it
made
him
feel
the
conversation
he
had
with
perry
and
the
idea
he
had
for
pwning
he
did
even
know
if
his
apartment
was
still
there
he
had
been
back
in
weeks
and
the
rent
was
overdue
and
the
comments
came
flooding
in
first
a
couple
dozen
from
his
friends
then
hundreds
then
thousands
raging
fights
some
people
accused
him
of
being
a
fakester
aimed
at
gathering
sympathy
or
donations
philosophical
arguments
buried
in
there
offers
from
real
world
and
online
friends
to
meet
him
at
the
hospital
to
get
him
home
to
take
care
of
him
it
was
unbelievable
there
was
a
small
fortune
wages
at
his
old
job
waiting
in
his
paypal
and
if
this
was
all
to
be
believed
there
was
a
cadre
of
people
waiting
just
outside
that
door
to
meet
him
the
nurse
who
came
to
get
him
looked
rattled
your
friends
are
here
she
said
in
her
accent
and
gave
him
a
disapproving
look
as
she
disconnected
his
hoses
and
pipes
so
swiftly
he
did
have
time
to
register
the
pain
he
felt
she
pulled
on
a
pair
of
salvation
army
underpants
the
first
pair
he
worn
in
weeks
and
a
pair
of
new
dark
and
a
rotary
picnic
dated
three
years
before
the
shirt
was
a
small
and
it
still
hung
from
him
like
a
tent
you
will
use
canes
she
asked
he
had
some
physiotherapy
that
week
and
he
could
take
one
or
two
doddering
steps
on
crutches
but
canes
no
way
i
ca
he
said
picturing
himself
sprawled
on
the
polished
concrete
floor
with
what
was
left
of
his
face
bashed
in
from
the
fall
wheelchair
she
said
to
someone
in
the
hall
and
an
orderly
came
in
pushing
a
chair
with
a
squeaky
wheel
though
the
chair
itself
was
a
pretty
good
one
at
least
as
good
as
the
ones
they
rented
at
disney
which
were
nearly
indestructible
he
let
the
nurse
transfer
him
to
it
with
her
strong
hands
in
his
armpits
and
under
his
knees
a
bag
containing
his
laptop
and
a
few
cards
and
things
that
had
shown
up
at
the
hospital
was
dumped
into
his
lap
and
he
clutched
it
to
himself
as
he
was
wheeled
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
around
the
corner
where
the
nurse
station
the
elevators
the
common
area
and
his
were
they
were
just
his
pals
though
there
were
a
few
of
them
there
but
also
a
big
crowd
of
people
he
never
met
did
recognize
there
were
goths
skinny
and
pale
and
draped
in
black
but
they
were
outnumbered
by
the
subculture
civilians
slightly
hippieish
old
and
young
when
he
hove
into
sight
they
burst
into
a
wild
cheer
the
orderly
stopped
pushing
his
chair
and
the
nurse
rushed
forward
to
shush
them
sternly
but
it
barely
dampened
the
calls
there
were
wolf
whistles
cheers
calls
disorganized
chants
and
then
two
very
pretty
girls
he
had
thought
about
pretty
anything
in
a
long
long
time
unfurled
a
banner
that
said
death
waits
in
glittery
letters
with
a
little
skull
dotting
the
i
in
waits
the
nurse
read
the
banner
and
reached
to
tear
it
out
of
their
hands
but
they
folded
it
back
she
came
to
him
and
hissed
in
his
ear
something
about
getting
security
to
get
rid
of
these
people
if
they
were
bothering
him
and
he
realized
that
she
thought
death
waits
was
a
and
that
made
him
laugh
so
hard
he
choked
and
she
flounced
off
in
a
deeply
slavic
huff
and
then
he
was
among
his
welcoming
party
and
it
a
party
there
were
cake
and
clove
cigarettes
in
and
cans
of
licorice
coffee
and
everyone
wanted
to
talk
with
him
and
take
their
pictures
with
him
and
the
two
pretty
girls
took
turns
making
up
his
face
highlighting
his
scars
to
make
him
fit
for
a
bela
lugosi
role
the
were
called
lacey
and
tracey
and
they
were
sisters
who
went
to
the
ride
every
day
they
said
breathlessly
and
they
seen
the
story
he
described
seen
it
with
their
own
eyes
and
it
was
something
that
was
as
personal
as
the
twin
language
they
developed
to
communicate
with
one
another
when
they
were
little
girls
his
old
friends
surrounded
him
guys
who
marveled
at
his
recovery
girls
who
kissed
his
cheek
and
messed
up
tracey
and
makeup
some
of
them
had
new
tattoos
to
show
him
one
girl
had
gotten
a
piece
showing
scenes
from
the
ride
and
she
slyly
pulled
her
skirt
all
the
way
up
all
the
way
up
to
show
him
where
it
all
started
security
showed
up
and
threw
them
all
out
into
the
street
where
the
heat
was
oppressive
and
wet
but
the
air
was
fresh
and
full
of
smells
that
were
sickness
or
medicine
which
made
death
waits
feel
like
he
could
get
up
and
dance
effervescent
citrus
and
biodiesel
fumes
moist
vegetation
and
the
hum
of
lazy
high
noon
bugs
now
it
all
arranged
one
of
the
ones
told
him
he
figured
out
that
these
were
the
pure
story
people
read
his
descriptions
and
concluded
that
he
seen
something
more
than
anyone
else
they
all
wanted
a
chance
to
talk
to
him
but
did
seem
too
put
out
that
he
was
spending
most
of
his
time
with
his
old
mates
do
worry
about
a
thing
car
after
car
appeared
taking
away
more
of
the
party
here
you
go
another
car
pulled
up
an
kneeling
number
with
a
huge
cargo
space
they
wheeled
the
chair
right
into
it
and
then
two
of
the
helped
him
transfer
into
the
seat
my
mom
was
in
a
wheelchair
for
ten
years
before
she
passed
a
hippie
told
him
he
was
older
and
looked
like
an
english
teacher
death
waits
had
quite
liked
in
grade
ten
he
strapped
death
waits
in
like
a
pro
and
off
they
went
they
were
ten
minutes
into
melbourne
traffic
death
marveling
at
buildings
signs
people
in
every
color
without
the
oppressive
colors
of
everything
in
the
hospital
when
the
english
teacher
dude
looked
shyly
at
death
you
think
it
real
the
story
i
mean
do
you
death
thought
about
this
for
a
second
he
been
very
focused
on
the
printers
for
the
past
week
which
felt
like
an
eternity
to
him
but
he
remembered
his
obsession
with
the
story
fondly
it
required
a
kind
of
floaty
to
really
see
it
a
meditative
state
he
found
easy
to
attain
with
all
the
painkillers
it
real
he
said
the
english
teacher
and
two
of
his
friends
seemed
to
relax
a
little
we
think
so
too
they
pulled
up
to
his
condo
how
they
know
where
he
lived
and
parked
right
next
to
his
car
he
could
see
where
the
tow
had
kind
of
the
rear
bumper
but
other
than
that
it
was
just
as
he
remembered
it
and
it
looked
like
someone
had
given
it
a
wash
too
the
english
teacher
put
his
car
in
park
and
came
around
to
open
his
door
just
as
the
rest
of
the
welcoming
party
came
out
of
his
building
pushing
a
wheelchair
the
same
kind
that
they
used
in
the
ride
death
laughed
aloud
with
delight
when
he
saw
it
rolling
toward
him
handling
the
curb
easily
hardly
a
bump
and
the
two
pretty
girls
tracey
and
lacey
transferred
him
into
it
and
both
contrived
to
brush
their
breasts
and
hair
across
his
cheeks
as
they
did
so
and
he
felt
the
first
stirrings
in
his
ruined
groin
that
he
felt
since
before
his
beating
he
laughed
like
a
and
they
all
laughed
with
him
and
someone
put
a
clove
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
he
drew
on
it
coughed
a
little
and
then
had
another
drag
before
he
rolled
into
the
elevator
the
girls
put
him
to
bed
hours
later
his
apartment
had
been
spotless
and
he
had
every
confidence
that
it
would
be
spotless
again
come
the
party
had
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
and
most
of
the
night
talking
about
the
story
that
they
seen
in
the
ride
where
they
seen
it
what
it
meant
there
was
a
lot
of
debate
about
whether
they
had
any
business
rating
things
now
that
the
story
had
shown
itself
to
them
the
story
was
the
product
of
unconscious
effort
and
it
should
be
left
to
unconscious
effort
but
the
was
that
they
had
a
duty
to
garden
the
story
or
possibly
to
sharpen
its
telling
or
to
protect
it
from
people
who
could
see
it
or
would
see
it
at
first
death
did
know
what
to
make
of
all
this
talk
at
first
he
found
it
funny
and
more
than
a
little
weird
to
be
taking
the
story
this
seriously
it
was
beautiful
but
it
was
an
accidental
beauty
the
ride
was
the
important
thing
the
story
was
its
effect
but
these
people
convinced
him
that
they
were
right
that
the
story
to
be
important
after
all
it
had
inspired
all
of
them
it
the
ride
was
just
technology
the
story
was
what
the
ride
was
his
head
swam
with
it
we
got
to
protect
it
he
said
finally
after
listening
to
the
argument
after
eating
the
food
with
which
they
filled
his
fridge
after
talking
intensely
with
tracey
or
possibly
lacey
about
their
parents
unthinking
blandness
after
letting
the
english
teacher
guy
whose
name
was
jim
take
him
to
the
toilet
after
letting
his
old
goth
pals
play
some
music
some
mutual
friends
had
just
mixed
we
got
to
protect
it
and
sharpen
it
the
story
wants
to
get
out
and
there
will
be
those
who
ca
see
it
he
did
care
that
his
speech
was
mangled
by
his
face
he
seen
his
face
in
the
mirror
and
tracey
and
lacey
had
done
a
nice
job
in
making
it
up
he
looked
like
a
marilyn
manson
his
twisted
mouth
a
ghoulish
smear
the
doctors
had
talked
about
giving
him
another
series
of
surgeries
to
fix
his
lip
a
set
of
implanted
dentures
to
replace
the
missing
teeth
had
even
mentioned
that
there
were
specialist
clinics
where
he
could
get
a
new
set
budded
and
grown
right
out
of
his
own
gums
that
had
been
back
when
the
mysterious
forces
of
the
lawsuit
and
the
ride
were
paying
his
bills
now
he
contemplated
his
face
in
the
mirror
and
told
himself
he
get
used
to
this
he
come
to
like
it
it
would
be
a
trademark
it
would
make
him
gothier
than
goth
for
life
always
an
outsider
always
one
of
the
weird
ones
like
the
who
come
to
disney
with
their
teenaged
kids
goths
kids
were
never
goths
it
seemed
more
like
or
types
or
hippies
or
gippies
or
dippies
or
tippies
or
whatever
but
their
parents
were
still
proudly
flying
their
weird
to
the
grave
we
let
everyone
know
about
it
he
said
thinking
not
of
but
of
all
the
cool
subculture
kids
he
grown
up
with
and
worshipped
and
been
rejected
by
and
dated
and
loved
and
hated
and
we
make
it
part
of
story
we
protect
it
guys
of
course
we
protect
it
that
settled
the
argument
death
had
expected
that
since
when
did
he
get
the
last
word
on
any
subject
since
now
they
were
following
his
lead
and
then
the
girls
put
him
to
bed
shyly
helping
him
undress
each
of
them
leaning
over
him
to
kiss
him
good
night
tracey
kiss
was
sisterly
on
the
cheek
her
spicy
perfume
and
her
hair
caressing
him
lacey
kiss
was
anything
but
sisterly
she
mashed
her
breasts
to
his
chest
and
thrust
her
tongue
into
his
mouth
keeping
her
silver
eyes
open
and
staring
deep
into
his
her
fingers
working
busily
in
his
hair
she
broke
the
kiss
off
with
a
gasp
and
a
giggle
she
traced
the
ruin
of
his
mouth
with
a
fingertip
breathing
heavily
and
let
it
slide
lower
down
his
chest
he
found
himself
actually
the
first
pleasurable
sensation
he
had
in
his
dick
since
that
fateful
night
from
the
corridor
came
an
impatient
cough
tracey
waiting
for
lacey
to
get
going
lacey
rolled
her
eyes
and
giggled
again
and
then
slid
her
hand
the
rest
of
the
way
down
briefly
holding
his
dick
and
then
encircling
his
balls
with
her
fingers
before
kissing
him
again
on
the
twist
of
his
lips
and
backing
out
of
the
room
whispering
sleep
well
see
you
in
the
morning
death
lay
awake
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
for
a
long
time
after
they
had
gone
the
english
teacher
dude
had
left
him
with
a
bedpan
for
the
night
and
many
of
them
had
promised
to
return
in
rotations
indefinitely
during
the
days
helping
him
out
with
dressing
and
shopping
and
getting
him
in
and
out
of
his
marvelous
chair
he
stared
and
stared
at
that
ceiling
and
then
he
reached
for
his
laptop
there
beside
the
bed
the
same
place
it
had
lived
when
he
was
in
the
hospital
he
fired
it
up
and
went
straight
to
of
the
ride
and
ran
through
them
from
different
angles
facing
backward
and
sideways
looking
down
and
looking
up
noting
all
the
elements
that
felt
like
and
all
the
ones
that
did
wishing
he
had
his
joystick
with
him
to
carve
out
the
story
he
was
seeing
lester
would
work
the
ride
anymore
so
perry
took
it
on
his
own
hilda
was
in
town
buying
groceries
his
of
gourmet
surplus
food
had
blown
its
compressor
and
the
contents
had
spoiled
in
a
mess
of
venison
and
sour
blueberry
sauce
and
duck
pancakes
and
he
stood
alone
normally
he
loved
this
being
the
carnival
barker
at
the
middle
of
the
circus
of
fans
tourists
and
hawkers
but
today
his
cast
itched
he
had
slept
enough
and
there
were
lawyers
chasing
him
lots
of
lawyers
a
caravan
of
cars
pulled
into
the
lot
like
a
tim
burton
version
of
a
funeral
a
long
train
of
funnycar
hearses
with
rear
wheels
and
leaning
gargoyles
and
black
bunting
with
leds
giving
them
a
commercially
eldritch
glow
mixed
in
were
some
straight
cars
and
they
came
and
came
and
came
car
on
car
the
hawkers
got
out
more
stuff
spread
it
out
further
and
waited
while
the
caravan
maneuvered
itself
into
parking
spots
spilling
out
into
the
street
riders
got
out
of
the
cars
mostly
goths
a
line
of
special
vegan
versions
of
victorian
delicacies
had
turned
a
cafe
in
portland
oregon
into
a
fortune
company
a
few
years
before
in
elaborate
diy
costumery
it
shimmered
darkly
petticoats
and
toppers
bodices
and
big
stompy
boots
and
trousers
cut
off
in
ribbons
at
the
knees
the
riders
converged
on
one
of
the
straight
cars
a
beige
and
crowded
around
it
a
moment
later
they
were
moving
toward
stand
the
crowd
parted
as
they
approached
and
in
perry
saw
whom
they
been
clustered
around
it
was
a
skinny
goth
kid
in
a
wheelchair
like
the
ones
they
kept
in
the
ride
they
get
that
every
now
and
again
a
guest
in
his
own
chair
just
needing
a
little
wireless
box
his
hair
was
shaggy
and
black
with
green
highlights
stuck
out
like
an
anime
cosplayer
he
was
white
as
wonder
bread
with
something
funny
about
his
mouth
his
legs
were
in
casts
that
had
been
wrapped
with
black
gauze
and
a
pair
of
black
pointy
shoes
had
been
slid
over
his
toes
tipped
with
elaborate
silver
curlicues
the
chair
zipped
forward
and
perry
recognized
him
in
a
flash
death
waits
he
felt
his
mouth
drop
open
and
he
shut
it
and
came
around
the
stand
no
way
he
said
and
grabbed
death
hand
encrusted
in
chunky
silver
jewelry
a
different
stylized
animal
skull
on
each
finger
death
ruined
mouth
pulled
up
in
a
kind
of
smile
nice
to
see
you
he
said
limply
squeezing
perry
hand
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
visit
me
in
the
hospital
perry
thought
of
all
the
things
that
had
happened
since
then
and
wondered
how
much
of
it
if
any
death
had
a
right
to
know
about
he
leaned
in
close
conscious
of
all
the
observers
i
out
of
the
lawsuit
we
are
me
and
lester
fired
those
guys
behind
his
reflective
contacts
death
eyes
widened
a
touch
he
slumped
a
little
because
of
me
perry
thought
some
not
exactly
but
in
a
way
it
was
us
death
smiled
thank
you
perry
straightened
up
looks
like
you
brought
down
a
good
crowd
he
said
lots
of
friends
death
nodded
lots
of
friends
these
days
he
said
an
attractive
young
woman
came
over
and
squeezed
his
shoulder
they
were
such
a
funny
bunch
in
their
diy
customized
boots
their
elaborate
tattoos
and
implants
and
piercings
but
for
all
that
cuddly
and
earnest
with
the
shadows
visible
of
the
geeks
they
been
perry
felt
he
was
smiling
so
broadly
it
almost
hurt
rides
are
on
me
gang
he
said
in
you
go
your
money
no
good
here
any
friend
of
death
waits
rides
for
free
today
they
cheered
and
patted
him
on
the
back
as
they
went
through
and
death
waits
looked
like
he
grown
three
inches
in
his
wheelchair
and
the
pretty
girl
kissed
perry
cheek
as
she
went
by
and
death
waits
had
a
smile
so
big
you
could
hardly
tell
there
was
anything
wrong
with
his
mouth
they
rode
it
through
six
times
in
a
row
and
as
they
came
back
around
for
another
go
and
another
they
talked
intently
about
the
story
the
story
the
story
perry
knew
about
the
story
he
seen
it
and
he
and
lester
had
talked
it
over
now
and
again
but
he
was
still
constantly
amazed
by
its
ability
to
inspire
riders
paying
customers
slipped
in
and
out
too
and
seemed
to
catch
some
of
the
infectious
intensity
of
the
story
group
they
went
away
in
pairs
talking
about
the
story
and
shopped
the
market
stalls
for
a
while
before
coming
back
to
ride
again
to
look
for
more
story
they
never
named
the
ride
it
had
always
been
the
ride
not
even
a
capital
for
a
second
perry
wondered
if
they
end
up
calling
it
the
story
in
the
end
perry
got
his
through
a
circuitous
route
getting
one
of
the
hawkers
brothers
to
order
it
to
a
po
box
in
miami
to
which
perry
would
drive
down
to
pick
it
up
and
take
it
back
lester
roused
himself
from
the
apartment
when
perry
told
him
it
had
arrived
lester
and
suzanne
had
been
awol
for
days
sleeping
in
until
perry
left
coming
back
after
perry
came
back
until
it
felt
like
they
were
just
travelers
staying
in
the
same
hotel
he
had
heard
a
peep
from
kettlewell
or
tjan
either
he
guessed
that
they
were
off
figuring
things
out
with
their
money
people
the
network
of
ride
operators
had
taken
the
news
with
equanimity
hilda
had
helped
him
write
the
message
so
that
it
kind
of
implied
that
everything
was
under
control
and
moving
along
nicely
but
when
perry
emailed
lester
to
say
he
was
going
to
drive
down
to
the
po
box
the
next
morning
before
opening
the
ride
lester
emailed
back
in
minutes
volunteering
to
come
with
him
he
had
coffee
ready
by
the
time
perry
got
out
of
the
shower
it
was
still
outside
the
sun
not
yet
risen
and
they
hardly
spoke
as
they
got
into
the
car
but
soon
they
were
on
the
open
road
kettlewell
and
tjan
are
going
to
sue
you
lester
said
there
it
was
all
in
a
short
sentence
been
talking
to
them
i
been
figuring
out
if
i
with
you
or
with
them
i
been
saving
your
ass
i
been
deciding
to
be
on
your
side
good
news
perry
said
that
would
have
really
sucked
perry
waited
for
the
rest
of
the
drive
for
lester
to
say
something
but
he
did
it
was
a
long
drive
the
whole
way
back
lester
talked
about
the
been
some
alien
autopsy
videos
of
them
posted
online
already
engineers
taking
them
to
bits
making
guesses
about
and
what
they
did
and
how
lester
had
watched
the
videos
avidly
and
he
held
his
own
opinions
and
he
was
eager
to
get
at
the
box
and
find
answers
for
himself
it
was
the
size
of
an
too
big
to
fit
on
his
lap
but
he
kept
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
it
the
a
glossy
pic
of
two
children
staring
at
a
box
from
which
disneoid
marvels
were
erupting
looked
a
little
like
the
make
your
own
monster
toy
perry
had
as
a
boy
it
actually
made
his
heart
skip
a
beat
the
way
that
that
old
toy
had
really
was
that
every
kid
dream
a
machine
that
created
wonders
from
dull
feedstock
they
got
back
to
the
ride
long
before
it
was
due
to
open
and
perry
asked
lester
if
he
wanted
to
get
a
second
breakfast
in
the
in
the
shantytown
but
lester
begged
off
heading
for
his
workshop
to
get
to
grips
with
the
box
so
perry
alone
waited
for
the
ride
to
open
standing
at
his
familiar
spot
behind
the
counter
the
hawkers
came
and
nodded
hello
to
him
a
customer
showed
up
another
perry
took
their
money
the
smelled
of
sticky
beverages
spilled
and
left
to
bake
in
the
heat
a
smell
like
bile
his
chair
was
an
uncomfortable
he
gotten
from
a
place
happy
for
the
bargain
he
logged
a
lot
of
hours
in
that
chair
it
had
wreaked
havoc
on
his
lower
spine
and
tenderized
his
ass
he
and
lester
had
started
this
as
a
lark
but
now
it
was
a
movement
and
not
one
that
was
good
for
his
mental
health
he
did
want
to
be
sitting
on
that
stool
he
might
as
well
be
working
in
a
liquor
store
the
was
the
same
hilda
broke
his
reverie
by
calling
his
phone
hey
gorgeous
she
said
she
bounded
out
of
bed
fully
formed
without
any
intervening
stages
of
invertebrate
and
homo
erectus
he
could
hear
that
she
was
ready
to
catch
the
world
by
the
ankle
and
chew
her
way
up
its
leg
hey
he
said
uh
oh
mr
badvibes
is
back
you
and
lester
fight
in
the
car
naw
he
said
that
was
fine
just
he
told
her
about
the
smell
and
the
stool
and
working
at
a
liquor
store
get
one
of
those
running
the
market
stalls
to
take
over
the
counter
and
take
me
to
the
beach
then
it
been
weeks
and
i
still
have
seen
the
ocean
i
beginning
to
think
it
an
urban
legend
so
that
what
he
did
hilda
drove
up
in
a
bikini
that
made
his
jaw
drop
and
bought
a
pair
of
polarizing
contacts
from
jason
and
perry
turned
the
till
over
to
one
of
the
more
trustworthy
vendors
and
they
hit
the
road
hilda
nuzzled
him
and
prodded
him
all
the
way
to
the
beach
kissing
him
at
the
red
lights
the
sky
was
blue
and
clear
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
in
all
directions
and
they
bought
a
bag
of
oranges
a
newspaper
a
picnic
lunch
and
a
book
of
replica
vintage
luggage
stickers
from
hawkers
at
various
they
unpacked
the
trunk
in
the
parking
garage
and
stepped
out
into
the
bright
day
and
that
when
they
noticed
the
wind
it
was
blowing
so
hard
it
took
hilda
sarong
off
as
soon
as
she
stepped
out
onto
the
street
perry
barely
had
time
to
snatch
the
cloth
out
of
the
air
the
wind
howled
they
looked
up
and
saw
the
bending
like
drawn
bows
the
vendors
and
carts
and
the
jewelry
hawkers
hurriedly
piling
everything
into
their
cars
guess
the
beach
is
cancelled
hilda
said
pointing
out
over
the
ocean
there
on
the
horizon
was
a
wall
of
black
cloud
scudding
rapidly
toward
them
in
the
raging
wind
shoulda
checked
the
weather
the
wind
whipped
up
stinging
clouds
of
sand
and
debris
it
gusted
hard
and
actually
blew
hilda
into
perry
he
caught
her
and
they
both
laughed
nervously
is
this
a
hurricane
she
asked
joking
not
joking
tension
in
her
voice
probably
not
he
was
thinking
of
hurricane
wilma
though
the
year
he
moved
to
florida
no
one
had
predicted
wilma
which
had
been
a
tropical
storm
miles
off
the
coast
until
it
was
until
it
was
smashing
a
path
of
destruction
from
key
west
to
kissimmee
he
been
working
a
straight
job
as
a
structural
engineer
for
a
condo
developer
and
he
seen
what
a
good
blow
could
do
to
the
condos
of
florida
which
were
built
mostly
from
dreams
promises
spit
and
kleenex
wilma
had
left
cars
stuck
in
trees
trees
stuck
in
houses
and
it
had
blown
just
like
this
when
it
hit
there
was
a
crackle
in
the
air
and
the
sighing
of
the
wind
turned
to
groans
seeming
to
come
from
everywhere
at
once
the
buildings
were
moaning
in
their
bones
as
the
winds
buffeted
them
we
have
to
get
out
of
here
perry
said
now
they
got
up
to
the
second
storey
of
the
parking
garage
when
the
whole
building
moaned
and
shuddered
beneath
them
like
a
tremor
they
froze
on
the
stairwell
somewhere
in
the
garage
something
crashed
into
something
else
with
a
sound
like
thunder
and
then
it
was
echoed
with
an
actual
a
sound
like
a
hundred
rifles
fired
in
unison
hilda
looked
at
him
no
way
not
further
up
not
in
this
building
he
agreed
they
pelted
down
the
street
and
into
the
first
sleeting
showers
coming
out
of
a
sky
that
was
now
dirty
grey
and
low
a
sandwich
board
advertising
energy
beverages
spun
through
the
air
like
a
frisbee
trailing
a
length
of
clothesline
that
had
tethered
it
to
the
front
of
some
cafe
on
the
beach
across
the
road
beachcomber
robots
burrowed
into
the
sand
trying
to
get
safe
from
the
wind
but
were
foiled
again
and
again
rolled
around
like
potato
bugs
into
the
street
into
the
sea
into
the
buildings
they
seizured
like
dying
things
perry
felt
an
irrational
urge
to
rescue
them
high
ground
hilda
said
pointing
away
from
the
beach
high
ground
and
find
a
basement
just
like
a
twister
a
sheet
of
water
lifted
off
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
swept
across
the
road
at
them
soaking
them
to
the
skin
followed
by
a
sheet
of
sand
that
coated
them
from
head
to
toe
it
was
all
the
encouragement
they
needed
they
ran
they
ran
but
the
streets
were
running
with
rain
now
and
more
debris
was
rolling
past
them
they
got
up
one
block
and
sloshed
across
the
road
they
made
it
halfway
up
the
next
block
past
a
coffee
shop
and
a
in
buildings
and
the
wind
literally
lifted
them
off
their
feet
and
slammed
them
to
the
ground
perry
grabbed
hilda
and
dragged
her
into
an
alley
behind
the
there
were
dumpsters
there
and
a
recessed
doorway
and
they
squeezed
past
the
dumpster
and
into
the
doorway
now
in
the
lee
they
realized
how
loud
the
storm
had
been
their
ears
rang
with
it
and
rang
again
with
another
thunderclap
their
chests
heaved
and
they
shivered
grabbing
each
other
the
doorway
stank
of
piss
and
the
crackling
ozone
around
them
this
place
holy
fuck
it
about
to
lift
off
and
fly
away
hilda
said
panting
perry
unbroken
arm
throbbed
and
he
looked
down
to
see
a
ragged
cut
running
the
length
of
his
forearm
from
the
dumpster
it
a
big
storm
perry
said
they
come
through
now
and
again
sometimes
they
blow
away
what
do
they
blow
away
trailers
apartment
buildings
they
were
both
spitting
sand
and
perry
arm
oozed
blood
sometimes
perry
said
they
huddled
together
and
listened
to
the
wind
lashing
at
the
buildings
around
them
the
dumpster
blocking
their
doorway
groaned
and
then
it
actually
slid
a
few
inches
water
coursed
down
the
alley
before
them
with
debris
caught
in
it
branches
trash
then
an
electric
motorcycle
scratching
against
the
road
as
it
rattled
through
the
river
they
watched
it
pass
without
speaking
then
both
of
them
screamed
and
scrambled
back
as
a
hissing
soaked
scrambled
over
the
dumpster
landing
practically
in
their
laps
clawing
at
them
with
hysterical
viciousness
fuck
hilda
said
as
it
caught
hold
of
her
thumb
with
its
teeth
she
pushed
at
its
face
ineffectually
hissing
with
pain
and
perry
finally
worked
a
thumb
into
the
hinge
of
its
jaw
and
forced
it
open
the
cat
sprang
away
clawing
up
his
face
leaping
back
onto
the
dumpster
hilda
thumb
was
punctured
many
times
already
running
free
with
blood
i
going
to
need
rabies
shots
she
said
but
i
live
they
cuddled
in
the
blood
and
the
mud
and
watched
the
river
swell
and
run
with
more
odd
debris
clothes
and
coolers
beer
bottles
and
a
laptop
cartons
of
milk
and
someone
purse
a
small
a
mailbox
finally
the
river
began
to
wane
the
rain
to
falter
was
that
it
hilda
said
maybe
perry
said
he
breathed
in
the
moist
air
his
arms
throbbed
one
broken
the
other
torn
open
the
rain
was
petering
out
fast
now
and
looking
up
he
could
see
blue
sky
peeking
through
the
dirty
heavy
clouds
which
were
scudding
away
as
fast
as
they
rolled
in
next
time
we
check
the
weather
before
we
go
to
the
beach
he
said
she
laughed
and
leaned
against
him
and
he
yelped
as
she
came
into
contact
with
his
hurt
arm
we
got
to
get
you
to
a
hospital
she
said
get
that
looked
at
you
too
he
said
pointing
at
her
thumb
it
was
all
so
weird
and
remote
now
as
they
walked
through
the
miami
streets
back
toward
the
garage
other
shocked
people
wandered
the
streets
weirdly
friendly
smiling
at
them
like
they
all
shared
a
secret
the
was
in
shambles
covered
in
blown
trash
and
mud
uprooted
trees
and
fallen
leaves
broken
glass
and
rolled
cars
perry
hit
the
car
radio
before
they
pulled
out
of
the
garage
an
announcer
reported
that
tropical
storm
henry
had
gone
about
three
miles
inland
before
petering
out
to
a
mere
along
with
news
about
the
freeways
and
hospitals
being
equally
jammed
huh
perry
said
well
what
do
we
do
now
let
find
a
hotel
room
hilda
said
have
showers
get
something
to
eat
it
was
a
weird
and
funny
idea
and
perry
liked
it
he
never
played
tourist
in
florida
but
what
better
place
to
do
so
they
gathered
their
snacks
from
the
back
of
the
car
and
used
the
first
aid
kit
in
the
trunk
to
tape
themselves
up
they
tried
to
reach
lester
but
no
one
answered
he
probably
at
the
ride
perry
said
or
in
the
disney
box
thing
ok
let
find
a
hotel
room
everything
on
the
beach
was
fully
booked
but
as
they
continued
inland
for
a
couple
blocks
they
came
upon
coffin
hotels
stacked
four
or
five
capsules
high
painted
gay
miami
deco
pastels
installed
in
rows
in
old
storefronts
or
stuck
in
spots
their
silvered
windows
looking
out
over
the
deserted
boulevards
should
we
perry
said
gesturing
at
them
if
we
can
get
an
empty
one
damn
right
these
things
are
going
to
be
in
serious
demand
in
pretty
short
order
stepping
into
the
coffin
hotel
transported
perry
back
to
his
days
on
the
road
his
days
staying
at
coffin
hotel
after
coffin
hotel
to
his
first
night
with
hilda
in
madison
one
look
at
hilda
told
him
she
felt
the
same
they
washed
each
other
slowly
as
though
they
were
underwater
cleaning
out
wounds
sluicing
away
the
caked
on
mud
and
grime
blown
deep
into
their
ears
and
the
creases
of
their
skin
nestled
against
their
scalps
they
lay
down
in
bed
naked
together
spooned
against
one
another
you
a
good
man
perry
gibbons
hilda
said
snuggling
against
him
hand
moving
in
slow
circles
on
his
tummy
they
slept
that
way
and
got
back
on
the
road
long
past
dark
driving
the
blasted
freeway
slowly
moving
around
the
broken
glass
and
blown
out
tires
that
remained
the
path
of
the
hurricane
followed
the
coast
straight
to
hollywood
a
line
of
smashed
trees
and
car
wrecks
and
roofs
that
made
the
nighttime
drive
even
more
disorienting
they
went
straight
back
to
the
condo
but
lester
was
there
worry
nagged
at
perry
take
me
to
the
ride
he
said
after
he
paced
the
apartment
a
few
times
hilda
looked
up
from
the
sofa
where
she
had
collapsed
the
instant
they
came
through
the
door
arm
flung
over
her
face
you
shitting
me
she
said
it
nearly
midnight
and
we
been
in
a
hurricane
perry
squirmed
i
got
a
bad
feeling
ok
and
i
ca
drive
myself
he
flapped
his
busted
arm
at
her
hilda
looked
at
him
her
eyes
narrowed
look
do
be
a
jerk
ok
lester
a
big
boy
he
probably
just
out
with
suzanne
he
have
called
you
if
there
been
a
problem
he
looked
at
her
bewildered
by
the
ferocity
of
her
response
ok
i
call
a
cab
he
said
trying
for
a
middle
ground
she
jumped
up
from
the
couch
whatever
fine
let
me
get
my
keys
jesus
he
had
no
idea
how
he
angered
her
but
it
was
clear
that
he
had
and
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
to
get
into
a
car
with
her
but
he
could
think
of
a
way
of
saying
that
without
escalating
things
so
they
drove
in
silence
to
the
ride
hilda
tense
with
anger
perry
tense
with
worry
both
of
them
touchy
as
cats
neither
saying
a
word
but
when
they
pulled
up
to
the
ride
they
both
let
out
a
gasp
it
was
lit
with
rigged
floodlights
and
car
headlights
and
it
was
swarming
with
people
as
they
drew
closer
they
saw
that
the
market
stalls
were
strewn
across
the
parking
lot
in
smashed
pieces
as
they
drew
closer
still
they
saw
that
the
ride
itself
was
staring
eyeless
at
them
smashed
perry
was
out
of
the
car
even
before
it
stopped
rolling
hilda
shouting
something
after
him
lester
was
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
wearing
a
paper
mask
and
rubber
boots
wading
in
deep
scummy
water
perry
splashed
to
a
halt
holy
shit
he
breathed
the
ride
was
lit
with
waterproof
lamps
and
led
torches
and
the
lights
reflected
crazily
from
the
still
water
that
filled
it
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
way
out
into
the
gloom
lester
looked
up
at
him
his
face
was
lined
and
exhausted
and
it
gleamed
with
sweat
storm
broke
out
all
the
windows
and
trashed
the
roof
then
flooded
us
out
it
did
a
real
number
on
the
market
too
his
voice
was
dead
perry
was
wordless
bits
of
the
floated
in
the
water
along
with
the
corpses
of
the
robots
no
drainage
lester
said
the
code
says
drainage
but
there
none
here
i
never
noticed
it
before
i
going
to
rig
a
pump
but
my
workshop
pretty
much
toast
lester
workshop
had
been
in
the
old
at
the
side
of
the
ride
it
was
all
glass
we
had
some
pretty
amazing
winds
perry
felt
like
he
should
be
showing
off
his
wound
to
prove
that
he
had
been
fucking
off
while
the
disaster
was
underway
but
he
could
bring
himself
to
do
so
we
got
caught
in
it
in
miami
he
said
wondered
where
you
were
the
kid
who
was
minding
the
shop
just
cut
and
run
when
the
storm
rolled
in
he
did
christ
what
an
irresponsible
asshole
i
break
his
neck
a
slimy
raft
of
kitchen
gnomes
their
second
business
venture
floated
past
silently
in
the
harsh
watery
light
the
smell
was
almost
unbearable
it
was
his
job
lester
voice
cracked
on
and
he
breathed
deeply
it
was
his
job
perry
it
was
your
job
running
around
having
a
good
time
with
your
girlfriend
firing
lawyers
he
stopped
and
breathed
again
you
know
that
going
to
sue
us
right
they
going
to
turn
us
into
a
smoking
ruin
because
you
fired
them
and
what
the
fuck
are
you
going
to
do
about
that
whose
job
is
that
i
thought
you
said
they
were
going
to
sue
perry
said
it
came
out
in
an
embarrassed
mumble
lester
had
never
talked
to
him
like
this
never
kettlewell
and
tjan
are
going
to
sue
lester
said
the
lawyers
you
fired
the
venture
capitalists
who
backed
them
they
going
to
turn
us
into
paste
what
would
you
have
preferred
hilda
said
she
was
standing
in
the
doorway
away
from
the
flood
watching
them
intently
her
eyes
were
but
she
was
rigid
with
anger
perry
could
hardly
look
at
her
would
you
have
preferred
to
have
those
fuckers
go
around
destroying
the
lives
of
your
supporters
in
order
to
enrich
a
few
pig
assholes
lester
just
looked
at
her
well
shut
up
yoko
he
said
we
having
a
private
conversation
here
perry
jaw
dropped
and
hilda
was
already
in
motion
sloshing
into
the
water
in
her
sandals
she
smacked
lester
across
the
cheek
a
crack
that
echoed
back
over
the
water
and
walls
lester
brought
his
hand
up
to
his
reddening
face
are
you
done
he
said
his
voice
hard
hilda
looked
at
perry
lester
looked
at
perry
perry
looked
at
the
water
i
meet
you
by
the
car
perry
said
it
came
out
in
a
mumble
they
held
for
a
moment
the
three
of
them
then
hilda
walked
out
again
leaving
lester
and
perry
looking
at
one
another
i
sorry
perry
said
about
hilda
about
the
lawsuits
about
skipping
out
about
everything
he
said
let
fix
this
up
ok
the
ride
i
do
even
know
if
i
want
to
why
bother
it
cost
a
fortune
to
get
it
online
and
they
only
shut
it
down
again
with
the
lawsuit
why
bother
so
we
wo
fix
the
ride
let
fix
us
why
bother
lester
said
and
it
came
out
in
the
same
mumble
the
watery
sounds
of
the
room
and
the
smell
and
the
harsh
reflected
rippling
light
made
perry
want
to
leave
lester
he
began
lester
shook
his
head
there
nothing
more
we
can
do
tonight
anyway
i
rent
a
pump
in
the
morning
i
do
it
perry
said
you
work
on
the
thing
lester
laughed
a
bitter
sound
yeah
ok
buddy
sure
out
in
the
the
hawkers
were
putting
their
stalls
back
together
as
best
they
could
the
shantytown
was
lit
up
and
perry
wondered
how
it
had
held
together
pretty
good
is
what
he
guessed
they
met
and
exceeded
county
code
on
all
of
those
plans
hilda
honked
the
horn
at
him
she
was
fuming
behind
the
wheel
and
they
drove
in
silence
he
felt
numb
and
wrung
out
and
he
did
know
what
to
say
to
her
he
lay
awake
in
bed
that
night
waiting
to
hear
lester
come
home
but
he
did
sammy
loved
his
morning
meetings
they
all
came
to
his
office
all
the
different
park
execs
creatives
and
emissaries
from
the
old
partner
companies
that
had
spun
off
to
make
movies
and
merch
and
educational
materials
they
all
came
each
day
to
talk
to
him
about
the
next
build
they
all
came
to
beg
him
to
think
about
adding
in
something
from
their
franchises
and
cantons
to
the
next
installment
there
were
over
a
million
diabs
in
the
field
now
and
they
even
trying
to
keep
up
with
orders
anymore
sammy
loved
looking
at
the
online
auction
sites
to
see
what
the
boxes
were
going
for
he
knew
that
some
of
his
people
had
siphoned
off
a
carload
or
two
of
the
things
to
out
the
back
door
he
loved
that
nothing
was
a
better
barometer
of
your
success
than
having
made
something
other
people
cared
enough
about
to
steal
he
loved
his
morning
meetings
and
he
conducted
them
with
the
flair
of
a
benevolent
emperor
he
gotten
a
bigger
office
technically
it
was
a
for
diab
strategy
but
sammy
the
diab
strategy
he
outfitted
it
with
of
their
diab
shrines
in
their
homes
with
kids
watching
enthralled
as
the
day
model
was
assembled
before
their
eyes
the
hypnotic
fascination
in
their
eyes
was
unmistakable
disney
was
the
focus
of
their
daily
lives
and
all
they
wanted
was
more
more
more
he
could
push
out
five
models
a
day
ten
and
they
go
nuts
for
them
but
he
would
he
was
too
cunning
one
model
a
day
was
all
leave
them
wanting
more
never
breathe
a
hint
of
what
the
next
day
model
would
be
oh
how
he
loved
to
watch
the
blogs
and
the
chatter
as
the
models
the
heated
fights
over
what
the
day
model
was
going
to
be
good
morning
ron
he
said
wiener
had
been
lobbying
to
get
a
main
street
build
into
the
models
for
weeks
now
and
sammy
was
taking
great
pleasure
in
denying
it
to
him
without
shutting
down
all
hope
getting
ron
wiener
to
grovel
before
him
every
morning
was
better
than
a
cup
of
coffee
i
been
thinking
about
what
you
said
and
you
right
wiener
said
he
always
started
the
meeting
by
telling
sammy
how
right
he
was
to
reject
his
last
idea
the
and
scene
would
have
too
many
pieces
house
cats
would
knock
it
over
we
need
something
more
unitary
more
visually
striking
so
here
what
been
thinking
what
about
the
sammy
raised
an
indulgent
eyebrow
kids
fire
trucks
all
the
colors
are
in
the
printer
gamut
i
checked
we
could
create
a
to
position
around
it
a
little
barn
for
it
the
only
thing
i
liked
about
firetrucks
when
i
was
a
kid
was
that
the
word
started
with
and
ended
with
sammy
smiled
when
he
said
it
and
waited
for
wiener
to
fake
hilarity
too
the
others
in
the
room
other
park
execs
some
of
their
licensing
partners
a
few
advertisers
laughed
too
officially
this
was
a
brainstorming
session
but
everyone
knew
that
it
was
all
about
getting
the
nod
from
sammy
wiener
laughed
dutifully
and
slunk
away
more
supplicants
came
forward
how
about
this
she
was
very
cute
dressed
in
smart
dark
clothes
that
were
more
lower
east
side
than
orlando
she
smelled
good
too
one
of
the
new
colognes
that
hinted
at
free
monomers
like
hot
plastic
or
a
tire
green
eyes
completed
the
package
what
you
got
there
she
was
from
an
ad
agency
someone
disney
parks
had
done
business
with
at
some
point
agencies
had
been
sending
their
people
to
these
meetings
too
trying
to
get
a
coup
for
one
of
their
clients
it
a
series
of
three
telling
a
little
story
beginning
middle
and
end
the
first
one
is
a
family
sitting
down
to
breakfast
and
you
can
see
it
the
same
old
crap
boring
microwave
omelets
and
breakfast
puddings
mom
bored
dad
more
bored
and
sis
and
brother
here
are
secretly
dumping
theirs
onto
mom
and
dad
plates
all
this
stuff
is
run
using
the
same
printers
so
it
looks
very
realistic
it
did
indeed
sammy
had
thought
about
it
but
he
supposed
it
was
only
natural
that
the
omelets
were
printed
how
else
could
general
mills
get
that
uniformity
he
should
talk
to
some
of
the
people
in
food
services
about
getting
some
of
that
tech
to
work
at
the
parks
so
in
part
two
they
setting
up
the
kitchen
around
this
mystery
box
one
part
lightbulb
oven
one
part
tardis
you
know
what
that
is
sammy
grinned
why
yes
i
believe
i
do
their
eyes
met
in
a
fierce
look
of
mutual
recognition
it
a
breakfast
printer
is
it
the
other
supplicants
in
the
room
sucked
in
a
collective
breath
some
chuckled
nervously
it
about
moving
the
apparatus
to
the
edge
bridging
the
last
mile
why
not
this
one
will
do
waffles
breakfast
cereals
bagels
and
baked
goods
small
cakes
new
designs
every
day
something
for
mom
and
dad
something
for
the
kids
something
for
the
sullen
teens
already
doing
this
at
the
regional
plants
and
distributorships
on
much
larger
scales
but
getting
our
stuff
into
consumers
homes
getting
them
to
our
food
sammy
held
up
a
hand
i
see
he
said
and
our
people
are
already
primed
for
experiences
they
right
in
your
sweet
spot
part
three
junior
and
little
sis
are
going
cuckoo
for
cocoa
puffs
but
these
things
are
shaped
with
their
portraits
on
each
mom
and
dad
are
eating
tres
sophistique
croissants
and
delicate
cakes
look
at
rover
here
with
his
own
see
how
happy
they
all
are
sammy
nodded
should
this
all
be
under
nondisclosure
he
said
probably
but
what
are
you
gon
na
do
you
guys
are
pretty
good
at
keeping
secrets
and
if
you
decide
to
shaft
us
by
selling
out
to
one
of
our
competitors
we
probably
dead
anyway
i
be
able
to
ship
out
half
a
million
units
in
the
first
week
then
we
can
ramp
production
if
need
be
lots
of
little
subcontractors
will
take
the
work
if
we
offer
sammy
liked
the
way
she
talked
like
someone
who
did
need
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
screwing
around
planning
like
someone
who
could
just
make
it
happen
you
launching
when
three
days
after
you
start
running
this
campaign
she
said
without
batting
an
eyelash
my
name
sammy
he
said
how
thursday
launch
on
sunday
she
shook
her
head
it
tricky
sunday
launches
got
ta
pay
everyone
she
gave
him
a
wink
what
the
hell
it
not
my
money
she
stuck
out
her
hand
she
was
wearing
a
couple
of
nice
chunky
obsidian
rings
in
abstract
curvy
shapes
looking
a
little
porny
in
their
suggestion
of
breasts
and
thighs
he
shook
her
hand
and
it
was
warm
and
dry
and
strong
well
that
this
week
taken
care
of
sammy
said
and
pointedly
cleared
the
surface
running
the
length
of
the
table
the
others
groaned
and
got
up
and
filed
out
the
woman
stayed
behind
dinah
she
said
she
handed
him
a
card
and
he
noted
the
agency
not
new
york
but
he
could
tell
she
was
a
transplant
you
got
any
breakfast
plans
it
was
hardly
gone
sammy
liked
to
get
these
meetings
started
early
i
normally
get
something
sent
in
but
your
little
prototypes
there
she
laughed
it
was
a
pretty
laugh
she
was
a
couple
years
older
than
him
and
she
wore
it
well
do
i
have
breakfast
plans
sammy
my
boy
i
nothing
breakfast
plans
i
have
a
launch
on
sunday
remember
heh
oh
yeah
i
on
the
next
flight
to
dfw
she
said
i
got
a
cab
waiting
to
take
me
to
the
airport
i
wonder
if
you
and
i
need
to
talk
over
some
details
sammy
said
only
if
you
want
to
do
it
in
the
taxi
i
was
thinking
we
could
do
it
on
the
plane
he
said
you
going
to
buy
a
ticket
on
my
plane
he
said
they
given
him
use
of
one
of
the
company
jets
when
he
started
really
ramping
production
on
the
diabs
oh
yes
i
think
that
can
be
arranged
she
said
it
sammy
right
right
he
said
they
left
the
building
and
had
an
altogether
lovely
flight
to
dallas
very
productive
lester
had
left
suzanne
apartment
in
days
she
rented
a
place
in
the
shantytown
bemused
at
the
idea
of
paying
rent
to
a
squatter
but
pleased
to
have
a
place
of
her
own
now
that
lester
and
apartment
had
become
so
tense
technically
he
was
working
on
the
disney
printers
which
she
found
interesting
in
an
abstract
way
they
had
a
working
one
and
a
couple
of
disassembled
ones
and
watching
the
working
one
do
its
thing
was
fascinating
for
a
day
or
two
but
then
it
was
just
a
tv
with
one
channel
broadcasting
one
frame
per
day
she
dutifully
wrote
about
it
though
and
about
perry
ongoing
efforts
to
the
ride
she
got
the
sense
from
him
that
he
was
heading
for
broke
lester
and
he
had
always
been
casual
about
money
but
buying
all
new
robots
more
printers
replacement
windows
fixing
the
roof
none
of
it
was
cheap
and
with
the
market
in
pieces
he
was
getting
any
rent
she
looked
over
lester
shoulder
for
the
fiftieth
time
how
it
going
do
write
about
this
ok
he
never
said
that
to
her
i
embargo
it
until
you
ship
he
grunted
fine
i
guess
ok
well
i
got
it
running
on
generic
goop
that
part
was
easy
i
can
also
load
my
own
designs
but
that
requires
physical
access
to
the
thing
in
order
to
load
new
firmware
they
do
make
it
easy
which
is
weird
it
like
they
do
plan
on
updating
it
once
it
in
the
field
maybe
they
just
plan
on
replacing
them
at
regular
intervals
why
the
firmware
matter
to
you
well
that
where
it
stores
information
about
where
to
get
the
designs
if
we
going
to
push
our
own
designs
to
it
we
need
to
give
people
an
easy
way
to
tell
it
to
tune
in
to
our
feed
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
change
the
firmware
the
alternative
would
be
oh
i
do
know
putting
another
machine
upstream
of
it
to
trick
it
into
thinking
that
it
accessing
their
site
when
it
really
going
to
ours
that
means
getting
people
to
configure
another
machine
no
one
but
a
few
hardcore
geeks
will
want
to
do
that
suzanne
nodded
she
wondered
if
a
few
hardcore
geeks
summed
up
the
total
audience
for
this
project
in
any
event
she
did
mention
it
though
lester
brow
was
so
furrowed
you
could
lose
a
dime
in
the
crease
above
his
nose
well
i
sure
you
get
it
she
said
yeah
it
just
a
matter
of
getting
at
the
i
could
totally
do
this
if
i
could
get
at
the
suzanne
knew
what
a
was
just
barely
the
thing
that
chose
which
os
to
load
when
you
turned
it
on
she
wondered
if
every
daring
sexy
technology
project
started
like
this
a
cranky
hacker
muttering
angrily
about
suzanne
missed
russia
she
had
a
good
life
there
covering
the
biotech
scene
those
hackers
were
a
lot
scarier
than
lester
and
perry
but
they
were
still
lovable
and
fascinating
in
their
own
way
better
than
the
ford
and
gm
execs
she
used
to
have
to
cozy
up
to
she
liked
the
manic
hustle
of
russia
the
glamour
and
the
squalor
she
bought
a
dacha
that
she
could
spend
weekends
at
and
the
in
petersburg
had
rollicking
parties
and
dinners
where
they
took
apart
the
day
experiences
on
planet
petrograd
i
going
out
lester
she
said
lester
looked
up
from
the
diab
and
blinked
a
few
times
then
seemed
to
rewind
the
conversation
hey
he
said
oh
hey
sorry
suzanne
i
just
i
trying
to
work
instead
of
think
these
days
thinking
just
makes
me
angry
i
do
know
what
to
do
he
broke
off
and
thumped
the
side
of
the
printer
how
perry
getting
on
with
rebuilding
he
getting
on
lester
said
as
far
as
i
know
i
read
that
the
death
waits
kid
and
his
people
had
come
by
to
help
whatever
that
means
he
freaks
me
out
suzanne
said
i
mean
i
feel
terrible
for
him
and
he
seemed
nice
enough
in
the
hospital
but
all
those
people
the
way
they
follow
him
around
it
just
weird
like
the
charismatic
cults
back
home
she
realized
she
just
called
russia
home
and
it
made
her
frown
just
how
long
was
she
going
to
stay
here
with
these
people
anyway
lester
had
noticed
i
guess
they
all
feel
sorry
for
him
and
they
like
what
he
has
to
say
about
stories
i
just
ca
get
a
lot
of
spit
in
my
mouth
over
the
ride
these
days
though
it
feels
like
something
we
did
and
completed
and
should
move
on
from
suzanne
did
have
anything
to
say
and
lester
was
particularly
expecting
anything
he
was
giving
off
a
palpable
vibe
so
she
let
herself
out
of
the
apartment
her
apartment
and
headed
out
into
the
shantytown
on
the
way
to
the
ride
she
passed
the
little
where
kettlewell
and
tjan
had
done
their
scheming
and
she
suddenly
felt
very
very
old
the
only
grownup
she
was
about
to
cross
the
freeway
to
the
ride
when
her
phone
rang
she
looked
at
the
face
and
then
nearly
dropped
it
freddy
was
calling
her
hello
suzanne
he
said
the
gloat
in
his
voice
was
unmistakable
he
had
something
really
slimy
up
his
sleeve
how
can
i
help
you
i
calling
for
comment
on
a
story
he
said
it
my
understanding
that
your
lad
perry
pitched
a
tantie
and
fired
the
of
the
ride
and
has
told
the
lawyers
representing
him
against
disney
that
he
intends
to
drop
the
suit
is
there
a
question
in
there
oh
there
are
many
questions
in
there
my
darling
for
starters
i
wondered
how
it
could
possibly
be
true
if
you
have
written
about
it
on
your
little
even
over
the
phone
she
could
hear
the
sarcastic
you
seem
to
be
quite
comprehensive
in
documenting
the
undertakings
of
your
friends
down
there
in
florida
are
you
asking
me
to
comment
on
why
i
have
commented
for
starters
have
you
approached
perry
for
a
comment
i
afraid
he
was
rather
abrupt
and
i
could
reach
his
valkyrie
of
the
midwest
either
so
i
left
calling
on
you
suzanne
any
comment
suzanne
stared
across
the
road
at
the
ride
she
been
gassed
there
chased
by
armed
men
watched
a
war
there
the
ride
does
have
much
formal
process
she
said
finally
that
means
that
words
like
do
really
apply
here
the
boys
might
have
a
disagreement
about
the
best
way
to
proceed
but
if
that
the
case
you
have
to
talk
to
them
about
it
are
you
saying
that
you
do
know
if
your
boyfriend
best
friend
is
fighting
with
his
business
partners
do
you
all
live
together
i
saying
that
if
you
want
to
find
out
what
lester
and
perry
are
doing
you
have
to
ask
lester
and
perry
and
the
living
together
thing
we
do
live
together
she
said
it
was
technically
true
really
freddy
said
do
we
have
a
bad
connection
you
do
live
together
no
where
do
you
live
then
my
place
she
said
have
your
informants
been
misinforming
you
i
hope
you
have
been
paying
for
your
information
freddy
i
suppose
you
do
though
i
suppose
there
no
end
of
cranks
who
really
enjoy
spiteful
gossip
and
are
more
than
happy
to
email
you
whatever
fantasies
they
concoct
freddy
tsked
and
you
do
know
what
happened
to
kettlewell
and
tjan
have
you
asked
them
i
will
he
said
but
since
you
the
ranking
reporter
on
the
scene
i
just
a
blogger
freddy
a
busy
blogger
good
afternoon
the
call
left
her
shaking
though
she
was
proud
of
how
calm
she
kept
her
voice
what
a
goddamned
troll
and
she
was
going
to
have
to
write
about
this
now
there
were
ladders
leaned
up
against
the
edge
of
the
ride
and
a
motley
crew
of
roofers
and
glaziers
on
them
and
on
the
roof
working
to
replace
the
gaping
holes
the
storm
had
left
the
workers
mostly
wore
black
and
had
dyed
hair
and
lots
of
metal
flashing
from
their
ears
and
faces
as
they
worked
a
couple
had
stripped
to
the
waist
revealing
tattoos
or
even
more
piercings
and
subcutaneous
implants
like
armor
running
over
their
spines
and
a
couple
of
blasted
out
grinding
incoherent
music
with
a
lot
of
electronic
screams
around
the
ride
the
were
coming
back
rebuilt
from
a
tower
of
lumber
stacked
in
the
this
was
a
lot
more
efficient
with
gangs
of
vendors
quickly
sawing
the
lumber
to
standard
sizes
slapping
each
one
with
a
positional
sensor
then
watching
the
sensor
lights
to
tell
them
when
it
was
properly
lined
up
with
its
mates
and
then
slipping
on
that
held
it
all
together
suzanne
watched
as
a
whole
market
stall
came
together
this
way
in
the
space
of
five
minutes
before
the
vendors
moved
on
to
their
next
stall
it
was
like
a
version
of
an
amish
performed
by
sketchy
hawkers
instead
of
bearded
technophobes
she
found
perry
inside
leaning
over
a
printer
tinkering
with
its
guts
led
torches
clipped
to
the
temples
of
his
glasses
he
was
hampered
by
having
only
one
good
arm
and
he
pressed
her
into
service
passing
him
tools
for
a
good
fifteen
minutes
before
he
straightened
up
and
really
looked
at
her
you
come
down
to
help
out
to
write
about
it
actually
the
room
was
a
hive
of
activity
a
lot
of
goth
kids
of
various
ages
and
degrees
of
freakiness
a
few
of
the
squatter
kids
some
people
she
recognized
from
the
second
coming
of
death
waits
she
could
see
death
waits
though
well
that
good
he
powered
up
the
printer
and
the
air
filled
with
the
familiar
smell
of
she
had
an
eerie
flashback
to
her
first
visit
to
this
place
when
they
showed
her
how
they
could
print
mutated
barbie
heads
how
lester
getting
on
with
cracking
that
printer
do
you
ask
him
yourself
she
did
say
it
she
did
know
why
lester
had
come
to
her
place
after
the
flood
instead
of
going
home
why
he
stiffened
up
and
sniffed
when
she
mentioned
name
why
he
looked
away
when
she
mentioned
hilda
something
about
firmware
he
straightened
his
back
more
making
it
pop
and
gave
her
his
devilish
grin
the
one
where
his
wonky
eyebrow
went
up
and
down
it
always
firmware
he
said
and
laughed
a
little
maybe
they
were
both
remembering
those
old
days
the
boogie
woogie
elmos
looks
like
you
got
a
lot
of
help
suzanne
said
getting
out
a
little
steno
pad
and
a
pen
perry
nodded
at
it
and
she
was
struck
by
how
many
times
they
stood
like
this
a
few
feet
apart
her
pen
poised
over
her
pad
chronicled
so
much
of
this
man
life
they
good
people
these
folks
some
of
them
have
some
carpentry
or
electronics
experience
the
rest
are
willing
to
learn
it
going
faster
than
i
thought
it
would
lots
of
support
from
out
in
the
world
too
people
sending
in
cash
to
help
with
replacement
parts
have
you
heard
from
kettlewell
or
tjan
the
light
went
out
of
his
face
no
he
said
how
about
from
the
lawyers
no
comment
he
said
it
did
sound
like
a
joke
come
on
perry
people
are
starting
to
ask
questions
someone
going
to
write
about
this
do
you
want
your
side
told
or
not
not
he
said
and
disappeared
back
into
the
guts
of
the
printer
she
stared
at
his
back
for
a
long
while
before
turning
on
her
heel
muttering
fuck
and
walking
back
out
into
the
sunshine
been
a
musty
smell
in
the
ride
but
out
here
it
was
the
florida
smell
of
citrus
and
and
sweat
from
the
people
around
her
working
hard
trying
to
wrest
a
living
from
the
world
she
walked
back
across
the
freeway
to
the
shantytown
and
ran
into
hilda
coming
the
other
way
the
younger
woman
gave
her
a
cool
look
and
then
looked
away
and
crossed
that
was
just
about
enough
suzanne
thought
enough
playtime
with
the
kids
time
to
go
find
some
grownups
she
was
here
for
her
health
if
lester
did
want
to
hang
out
with
her
if
perry
had
had
enough
of
her
it
was
time
to
go
do
something
else
she
went
back
to
her
room
where
lester
was
still
working
on
his
diab
project
she
took
out
her
suitcase
and
packed
with
the
efficiency
of
long
experience
lester
did
notice
not
even
when
she
took
the
blouse
she
and
hung
to
dry
on
the
back
of
his
chair
folded
it
and
put
it
in
her
suitcase
and
zipped
it
shut
she
looked
at
his
back
working
over
the
bench
for
a
long
time
he
had
a
of
chocolate
pudding
beside
him
and
a
wastebasket
overflowing
with
food
wrappers
and
boxes
he
shifted
in
his
seat
and
let
out
a
soft
fart
she
left
she
paid
the
landlady
through
the
end
of
the
week
she
could
send
lester
an
email
later
the
cab
took
her
to
miami
it
was
until
she
got
to
the
airport
that
she
realized
she
had
no
idea
where
she
was
going
boston
san
francisco
petersburg
she
opened
her
laptop
and
began
to
price
out
last
minute
tickets
the
rush
of
travelers
moved
around
her
and
she
was
jostled
many
times
the
standby
sites
gave
her
a
thousand
options
miami
to
jfk
to
heathrow
to
petersburg
miami
to
frankfurt
to
moscow
to
petersburg
miami
to
dallas
to
san
francisco
the
permutations
were
overwhelming
especially
since
she
was
sure
where
she
wanted
to
be
then
she
heard
something
homey
and
familiar
a
large
group
of
russian
tourists
walking
past
talking
loudly
in
russian
complaining
about
the
long
flight
the
bad
food
and
the
incompetence
of
their
tour
operator
she
smiled
to
see
the
old
men
with
their
pants
and
the
old
women
with
their
bouffant
hair
she
could
help
but
eavesdrop
at
their
volume
she
would
have
been
to
listen
in
a
little
boy
and
girl
tore
ass
around
the
airport
under
the
disapproving
glares
from
dhs
goons
and
they
screamed
as
they
ran
disney
world
disney
world
disney
world
she
never
been
she
been
to
a
couple
of
the
kitschy
gulag
parks
in
russia
and
she
grown
up
with
six
flags
coaster
parks
and
ontario
place
and
the
cne
in
toronto
not
far
from
detroit
but
she
never
been
to
the
big
one
the
place
that
even
now
managed
to
dominate
the
world
consciousness
of
she
asked
her
standby
sites
to
find
her
a
room
in
a
disney
hotel
instead
looking
for
an
inclusive
rate
that
would
get
her
onto
the
rides
and
pay
for
her
meals
these
were
advertised
at
roadside
kiosks
at
intervals
on
every
freeway
in
florida
so
she
suspected
they
were
the
best
deal
going
a
moment
of
browsing
showed
her
that
she
guessed
wrong
a
week
in
disney
cost
a
sum
of
money
the
equivalent
of
six
months
rent
in
petersburg
how
did
all
these
russians
afford
this
trip
what
the
hell
compelled
people
to
part
with
these
sums
she
was
going
to
have
to
find
out
it
was
research
plus
she
needed
a
vacation
she
booked
in
bought
a
ticket
and
grabbed
the
handle
of
her
suitcase
she
examined
her
welcome
package
as
she
waited
for
the
train
she
was
staying
at
something
called
the
polynesian
resort
hotel
and
the
brochure
showed
a
set
of
longhouses
set
on
an
ersatz
beach
with
a
crew
of
mexican
and
cuban
domestic
workers
in
leis
shirts
and
waving
and
smiling
her
package
included
a
complimentary
luau
the
pictures
made
it
clear
this
was
nothing
like
the
tourist
luaus
attended
in
maui
on
top
of
that
she
was
entitled
to
a
character
breakfast
with
a
in
an
overheated
plush
costume
and
an
hour
with
a
resort
counsellor
who
help
her
plan
her
trip
for
maximal
fun
the
came
and
took
on
the
passengers
families
bouncing
with
anticipation
joking
and
laughing
in
every
language
spoken
these
people
had
just
come
through
a
us
customs
checkpoint
and
they
were
acting
like
the
world
was
a
fine
place
she
decided
there
must
be
something
to
this
disney
business
death
waits
waited
and
waited
and
waited
for
the
ride
to
come
back
online
he
split
his
days
between
hanging
out
at
home
writing
about
the
story
running
the
from
the
other
rides
watching
what
was
happening
in
brazil
answering
his
the
rest
of
the
time
he
spent
with
his
new
friends
down
at
the
site
of
the
ride
encouraging
them
to
pitch
in
and
help
perry
and
lester
to
get
the
thing
back
up
and
running
fast
please
it
was
driving
him
bonkers
not
to
be
able
to
ride
any
longer
after
everything
he
been
through
he
deserved
a
ride
his
friends
were
wonderful
wonderful
lacey
especially
she
was
a
nurse
and
a
goddess
of
mercy
the
money
that
flooded
into
his
paypals
whenever
his
friends
let
it
be
known
that
he
needed
more
covered
all
his
expenses
he
never
wanted
for
companionship
conversation
helpmeets
or
respect
it
was
a
wonderful
life
if
only
the
ride
would
come
online
he
woke
next
to
lacey
she
asleep
still
her
hair
spread
out
across
the
pillow
in
a
fall
of
shiny
black
with
blue
highlights
given
him
a
matching
a
few
days
before
and
they
looked
like
a
matched
set
now
he
let
his
hands
lazily
trace
her
soft
skin
the
outlines
of
her
tattoos
her
implants
and
piercings
he
felt
a
stirring
between
his
legs
lacey
yawned
and
woke
and
kissed
him
good
morning
my
handsome
man
she
said
good
morning
my
beautiful
woman
what
the
plan
for
today
whatever
you
want
she
said
breakfast
then
down
to
the
ride
he
said
i
do
my
email
and
writing
there
today
something
before
breakfast
she
asked
with
a
lopsided
smile
that
was
adorable
oh
yes
please
he
said
his
voice
breathy
the
smell
at
the
was
overpowering
it
was
one
part
sharp
mold
one
part
industrial
disinfectant
a
citrus
smell
that
made
your
eyes
water
and
your
sinuses
burn
i
rented
some
big
blowers
perry
said
they
help
air
the
place
out
if
that
does
work
i
might
have
to
resurface
the
floor
which
would
be
rough
it
could
take
a
week
to
get
that
done
properly
a
week
death
said
jesus
no
way
not
another
week
he
did
know
it
for
sure
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
a
lot
of
these
people
would
stop
showing
up
eventually
if
there
was
no
ride
for
them
to
geek
out
over
he
sure
would
you
smell
that
we
ca
close
the
doors
and
the
windows
and
leave
it
like
this
death
people
standing
around
them
listening
in
nodded
it
was
true
you
melt
people
lungs
if
you
shut
them
up
with
these
fumes
how
can
i
help
death
said
it
was
his
constant
mantra
with
perry
sometimes
he
did
think
perry
liked
him
very
much
and
it
was
good
to
keep
on
reminding
him
that
death
and
his
buddies
were
here
to
be
part
of
the
solution
that
perry
needed
them
the
roof
is
just
about
done
the
robots
are
back
online
the
dividers
should
be
done
today
i
got
the
chairs
stripped
down
for
routine
maintenance
i
could
use
a
couple
people
for
that
what
lester
working
on
death
said
you
have
to
ask
him
death
had
seen
lester
in
days
which
was
weird
he
hoped
lester
did
dislike
him
he
worried
a
lot
about
whether
people
liked
him
these
days
he
thought
that
sammy
liked
him
after
all
where
is
he
do
know
perry
put
dark
glasses
on
death
waits
took
the
hint
come
on
he
said
to
lacey
who
patted
him
on
the
hand
as
he
lifted
up
in
his
chair
and
rolled
out
to
the
van
let
just
call
him
lo
it
death
waits
we
down
at
the
ride
but
there
not
much
to
do
around
here
i
thought
maybe
we
could
help
you
with
whatever
you
were
working
on
what
do
you
know
about
what
i
working
on
lester
said
um
nothing
so
how
do
you
know
you
want
to
help
death
waits
closed
his
eyes
he
wanted
to
help
these
two
they
made
something
important
did
they
know
that
what
are
you
working
on
nothing
lester
said
come
on
death
said
come
on
we
just
want
to
pitch
in
i
love
you
guys
you
changed
my
life
let
me
contribute
lester
snorted
cross
the
road
go
straight
for
two
hundred
yards
turn
left
at
the
house
with
the
cesar
chavez
mural
and
i
meet
you
there
you
mean
go
into
the
death
did
know
what
it
was
called
he
always
tried
not
to
look
at
it
when
he
came
to
the
ride
that
slum
across
the
road
he
knew
it
was
somehow
connected
with
the
ride
but
in
the
same
way
that
the
administrative
buildings
at
disney
were
connected
with
the
parks
the
big
difference
was
that
extraneous
buildings
were
shielded
from
view
by
berms
and
painted
green
the
weird
town
across
the
road
was
yeah
across
the
road
into
the
shantytown
ok
death
said
see
you
soon
he
hung
up
and
patted
hand
we
going
over
there
he
said
pointing
into
the
shantytown
is
it
safe
he
shrugged
i
guess
so
he
loved
his
chair
loved
how
tall
it
made
him
loved
how
it
turned
him
into
a
cyborg
who
could
raise
up
on
his
rear
wheels
and
rock
back
and
forth
like
a
triffid
now
he
felt
very
vulnerable
a
crippled
cyborg
whose
apparatus
cost
a
small
fortune
about
to
go
into
a
neighborhood
full
of
people
who
were
technically
homeless
should
we
drive
i
think
we
can
make
it
across
he
said
traffic
was
light
though
the
cars
that
bombed
past
were
doing
or
more
he
started
to
gather
up
a
few
more
of
his
people
but
reconsidered
it
was
a
little
scary
to
be
going
into
the
town
but
he
could
afford
to
freak
out
lester
by
showing
up
with
an
entourage
the
guardrail
shielding
the
town
had
been
bent
down
and
flattened
and
the
chair
wheeled
over
it
easily
with
hardly
a
bump
as
they
crossed
this
border
they
crossed
over
to
another
world
there
were
cooking
smells
barbecue
and
cuban
spices
and
a
little
hint
of
septic
tank
or
compost
heap
the
buildings
did
make
any
sense
to
eye
they
curved
or
sloped
or
twisted
or
leaned
and
seemed
to
be
made
of
equal
parts
cement
and
aluminum
and
scrap
lumber
laundry
lines
power
lines
and
graffiti
death
was
used
to
drawing
stares
even
before
he
became
a
cyborg
with
a
beautiful
woman
beside
him
but
this
was
different
there
were
eyes
everywhere
little
kids
playing
in
the
street
had
these
people
heard
of
stranger
danger
stopped
to
stare
at
him
with
big
eyes
faces
peered
out
of
windows
from
the
ground
on
up
to
the
third
storey
voices
whispered
and
called
lacey
gave
them
her
sunniest
smile
and
even
waved
at
the
little
kids
and
death
tried
nodding
at
some
of
the
homeys
staring
at
him
from
the
window
of
what
looked
like
a
little
diner
death
had
known
what
to
expect
from
this
little
town
but
he
certainly
had
pictured
so
many
little
shops
he
realized
that
he
thought
of
shops
as
being
somehow
civilized
tax
paying
entities
with
commercial
relationships
with
suppliers
with
and
employees
not
lawless
and
wild
but
every
seemed
to
have
at
least
a
small
shop
advertised
with
bright
oled
that
showed
rotating
enticements
de
dominica
beautiful
for
ladies
oferta
fantasy
he
passed
twenty
different
shops
in
as
many
steps
some
of
them
seemingly
nothing
more
than
a
counter
recessed
into
the
wall
with
a
young
man
sitting
behind
it
grinning
at
them
lacey
stopped
at
one
and
bought
them
cans
of
coffee
and
small
mexican
pastries
dusted
with
cinnamon
he
watched
a
hundred
pairs
of
eyes
watch
lacey
as
she
drew
out
her
purse
and
paid
at
first
he
thought
of
the
danger
but
then
he
realized
that
if
anyone
was
to
mug
them
it
would
be
in
full
sight
of
all
these
people
it
was
a
funny
thought
he
grown
up
in
sparse
suburbs
where
never
see
anyone
walking
or
standing
on
the
sidewalks
or
their
porches
even
though
it
was
a
nice
neighborhood
there
were
muggings
and
even
killings
at
regular
horrific
intervals
walking
there
felt
like
taking
your
life
into
your
hands
here
in
this
crowded
place
with
a
human
density
like
a
disney
park
it
felt
somehow
safer
weird
they
came
to
what
had
to
be
the
cesar
chavez
mural
a
mexican
in
a
cowboy
hat
standing
like
a
preacher
on
the
tailgate
of
a
truck
surrounded
by
more
mexicans
in
cotton
shirts
and
and
cowboy
hats
they
turned
left
and
rounded
a
corner
into
a
little
with
a
confusion
of
hopscotches
chalked
onto
the
ground
ringed
by
parked
bicycles
and
scooters
lester
stood
among
them
eating
a
churro
in
a
piece
of
you
seem
to
be
recovering
quickly
he
said
sizing
up
death
in
his
chair
good
to
see
it
he
seemed
a
little
distant
which
death
chalked
up
to
being
interrupted
it
great
to
see
you
again
death
said
my
friends
and
i
have
been
coming
by
the
ride
every
day
helping
out
however
we
can
but
we
never
see
you
there
so
i
thought
i
call
you
you
call
me
to
see
if
we
could
help
death
said
with
whatever
you
doing
come
in
lester
said
he
gestured
behind
him
and
death
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
small
sign
that
said
rothschild
with
a
stately
peacock
behind
it
the
door
was
a
little
narrow
for
his
rolling
chair
but
he
managed
to
get
it
in
with
a
little
but
once
inside
he
was
stymied
by
the
narrow
staircase
leading
up
to
the
upper
floors
the
lobby
such
as
it
was
was
completely
filled
by
him
lacey
and
lester
and
even
if
the
chair
could
have
squeezed
up
the
stairs
it
could
have
cornered
to
get
there
lester
looked
embarrassed
sorry
i
did
think
of
that
um
ok
i
could
rig
a
winch
and
hoist
the
chair
up
if
you
want
we
have
to
belt
you
in
but
it
there
are
masts
for
pulleys
on
the
top
floor
it
how
they
get
the
beds
into
the
upper
stories
i
can
get
up
on
canes
death
waits
said
is
it
safe
to
leave
my
chair
outside
though
lester
eyebrows
went
up
well
of
course
sure
it
is
death
felt
weird
for
having
asked
he
backed
the
chair
out
and
locked
the
transmission
feeling
silly
who
was
going
to
a
wheelchair
he
was
such
a
dork
lacey
handed
him
his
canes
and
he
stood
gingerly
he
been
making
his
way
to
the
bathroom
and
back
on
canes
all
week
but
he
had
tried
stairs
yet
he
hoped
lester
was
too
many
floors
up
lester
turned
out
to
be
on
the
third
floor
and
by
the
time
they
reached
it
death
waits
was
dripping
sweat
and
his
eyeliner
had
run
into
his
eyes
lacey
dabbed
at
him
with
her
gauzy
scarf
and
fussed
over
him
death
caught
lester
looking
at
the
two
of
them
with
a
little
smirk
so
he
pushed
lacey
away
and
steadied
his
breathing
with
an
effort
ok
he
said
all
done
great
lester
said
this
is
what
i
working
on
you
talked
to
perry
about
it
before
right
the
printers
well
cracked
it
we
can
load
our
own
firmware
onto
it
just
stick
it
on
a
network
with
a
pc
and
the
pc
will
find
it
and
update
it
then
it
becomes
an
open
box
it
accept
anyone
goop
you
can
send
it
your
own
plans
death
had
seen
a
diab
in
person
yet
beholding
it
and
knowing
that
he
was
the
reason
that
lester
and
perry
were
experimenting
with
it
in
the
first
place
made
him
feel
a
sense
of
excitement
he
had
felt
since
the
goth
rehab
of
fantasyland
began
so
how
does
this
tie
in
to
the
ride
death
asked
i
was
thinking
of
building
rides
in
miniature
but
at
that
scale
will
it
really
impress
people
no
i
do
think
so
so
instead
i
was
thinking
that
we
could
just
push
out
details
from
the
ride
little
miniatures
showing
a
piece
every
day
maybe
whatever
was
newest
and
you
could
have
multiple
feeds
you
know
like
an
experimental
trunk
for
objects
that
people
in
one
region
liked
lester
was
shaking
his
head
and
holding
up
his
hands
woah
wait
a
second
no
no
no
death
was
used
to
having
his
friends
hang
on
his
every
word
when
he
was
talking
about
ideas
for
the
ride
and
the
story
so
this
brought
him
up
short
he
reminded
himself
who
he
was
talking
to
sorry
he
said
got
ahead
of
myself
look
lester
said
prodding
at
the
printer
this
thing
is
its
own
thing
we
about
more
than
the
ride
here
i
know
you
really
like
it
and
that
very
cool
but
there
no
way
that
everything
i
do
from
now
on
is
going
to
be
about
that
fucking
thing
it
was
a
lark
it
cool
it
got
its
own
momentum
but
these
boxes
are
going
to
be
their
own
thing
i
want
to
show
people
how
to
take
control
of
the
stuff
in
their
living
rooms
not
advertise
my
little
commercial
project
to
them
death
could
make
sense
out
of
this
it
sounded
like
lester
the
ride
how
was
that
possible
i
do
get
it
he
said
at
last
lester
was
making
him
look
like
an
idiot
in
front
of
lacey
too
he
did
like
how
this
was
going
at
all
lester
picked
up
a
screwdriver
you
see
this
it
a
tool
you
can
pick
it
up
and
you
can
unscrew
stuff
or
screw
stuff
in
you
can
use
the
handle
for
a
hammer
you
can
use
the
blade
to
open
paint
cans
you
can
throw
it
away
loan
it
out
or
paint
it
purple
and
frame
it
he
thumped
the
printer
this
thing
is
a
tool
too
but
it
not
tool
it
belongs
to
someone
else
disney
it
is
interested
in
listening
to
you
or
obeying
you
it
does
want
to
give
you
more
control
over
your
life
this
thing
reminds
me
of
life
before
fatkins
it
was
my
very
own
personal
body
but
it
was
under
my
control
what
the
word
the
academics
use
i
did
have
any
agency
it
did
matter
what
i
did
i
was
just
this
fat
thing
that
my
brain
had
to
lug
around
behind
it
listening
to
its
complaints
and
aches
and
pains
if
you
do
control
your
life
you
miserable
think
of
the
people
who
do
get
to
run
their
own
lives
prisoners
kids
mental
patients
there
something
inherently
awful
about
living
like
that
autonomy
makes
us
happy
he
thumped
the
top
of
the
printer
again
so
here
this
stupid
thing
which
disney
gives
you
for
free
it
looks
like
a
tool
like
a
thing
that
you
use
to
better
your
life
but
in
reality
it
a
tool
that
disney
uses
to
control
your
life
you
ca
program
it
you
change
the
channel
it
does
even
have
an
that
what
gets
me
exercised
i
want
to
redesign
this
thing
so
it
gets
converted
from
something
that
controls
to
something
that
gives
you
control
lester
eyes
shone
death
hurt
from
head
to
toe
from
the
climb
and
the
aftermath
of
the
beating
and
the
life
he
lived
lester
was
telling
him
that
the
ride
was
important
to
him
anymore
that
be
doing
this
other
thing
with
the
printer
next
and
then
something
else
and
then
something
else
he
felt
a
great
unexpected
upwelling
of
bitterness
at
the
thought
so
what
about
the
ride
the
ride
i
told
you
i
done
with
it
it
time
to
do
the
next
thing
you
said
you
wanted
to
help
out
right
with
the
ride
death
said
patiently
with
the
manner
of
someone
talking
to
a
child
lester
turned
his
back
on
death
i
done
with
the
ride
lester
said
i
do
want
to
waste
your
time
it
was
clear
he
meant
wasting
my
time
he
bent
over
the
printer
lacey
looked
daggers
at
his
shoulders
then
turned
to
help
death
down
the
stairs
his
canes
clattered
on
the
narrow
staircase
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
suzanne
rode
the
from
miami
airport
in
amusement
watching
the
rock
back
and
forth
she
bought
herself
a
mickey
waffle
and
a
diet
coke
in
the
dining
car
and
fended
off
the
offers
of
plush
animatronic
toys
that
were
clearly
descended
from
elmo
now
she
watched
the
kids
tear
ass
up
and
down
the
train
or
sit
mesmerized
by
the
videos
and
interactives
set
up
at
the
ends
of
the
cars
the
train
was
really
slick
and
judging
from
the
brochure
she
found
in
the
there
was
another
one
from
the
orlando
airport
these
things
were
like
chutes
leading
from
the
luggage
carousel
straight
into
the
parks
disney
had
figured
out
how
to
make
sure
that
every
penny
spent
by
its
tourists
went
straight
into
its
coffers
the
announcements
as
they
pulled
into
the
station
were
in
english
chinese
spanish
farsi
and
russian
in
that
order
and
displayed
on
the
porters
red
coats
with
brass
buttons
were
with
the
flags
of
many
nations
denoting
the
languages
they
spoke
they
wore
and
suzanne
a
veteran
of
innumerable
hotels
could
not
dissuade
one
from
taking
her
suitcase
he
brought
her
to
a
and
saw
her
aboard
a
bus
marked
for
the
polynesian
decorated
with
bamboo
and
she
touched
one
and
discovered
that
it
was
vinyl
he
refused
her
tip
as
they
saw
her
aboard
and
then
stood
and
waved
her
off
with
his
white
gloves
and
giant
white
smile
she
had
to
chuckle
as
she
pulled
away
amazed
at
how
effective
these
little
touches
were
she
felt
her
muscles
loosening
little
involuntary
chuckles
rising
in
her
throat
the
coach
was
full
of
parents
and
children
from
all
over
the
world
grinning
and
laughing
and
hugging
and
talking
excitedly
about
the
day
ahead
of
them
the
coach
let
them
off
to
a
group
of
staff
who
shouted
aloha
at
them
as
they
debarked
and
picked
up
their
luggage
with
swift
cheerful
relentless
efficiency
her
was
so
painless
she
was
sure
it
was
over
until
a
nice
young
lady
who
looked
chechen
picked
up
her
bag
for
her
and
urged
her
out
to
the
grounds
which
were
green
and
lush
like
nothing
she
seen
since
landing
in
florida
she
was
surrounded
by
the
hotel
structures
decorated
with
polynesian
masks
and
stalked
by
leggy
ibises
and
chirping
tropical
birds
before
her
was
a
beach
fronting
onto
an
artificial
lake
ringed
with
other
luxury
hotels
a
gigantic
soviet
building
and
a
victorian
hotel
the
lake
was
ringed
with
a
monorail
track
and
plied
by
handsome
she
stared
at
this
until
the
bellhop
gently
tugged
at
her
elbow
giving
her
a
dazzling
smile
her
room
was
the
kind
of
thing
you
see
lucy
and
ricky
checking
into
on
honeymoon
in
an
old
love
episode
wicker
ceiling
fans
bamboo
furniture
a
huge
shaped
like
a
seashell
outside
a
little
terrace
looking
over
the
lake
with
a
pair
of
cockatoos
looking
quizzically
at
her
the
bellhop
waved
at
them
and
they
cawed
at
her
and
flew
off
suzanne
must
have
made
a
disappointed
noise
because
the
bellhop
patted
her
on
the
arm
and
said
do
worry
we
feed
them
here
they
come
back
all
the
time
greedy
birdies
she
tipped
the
bellhop
five
bucks
once
she
been
given
the
grand
tour
of
the
room
a
tame
internet
connection
that
was
and
a
likewise
censored
service
delivery
pizza
or
sushi
information
on
park
hours
including
the
dazzling
array
of
extras
she
could
purchase
it
turned
out
that
resort
guests
were
eligible
to
purchase
priority
passes
for
boarding
rides
ahead
of
the
plebes
and
for
entering
parks
early
and
staying
late
this
made
suzanne
feel
right
at
home
it
was
very
russian
in
its
approach
the
more
you
spent
the
better
your
time
was
she
bought
it
all
all
the
and
priority
cards
all
of
it
loaded
into
a
grinning
mickey
on
a
lanyard
a
wireless
pendant
that
would
take
care
of
her
everywhere
she
went
in
the
park
letting
her
spend
money
like
water
thus
girded
she
consulted
with
her
bellhop
some
more
and
laid
out
an
itinerary
once
she
showered
she
found
she
did
want
to
wear
any
of
her
european
tailored
shorts
and
blouses
she
wanted
to
disappear
into
the
great
american
mass
the
hotel
gift
shop
provided
her
with
a
barkcloth
shirt
decorated
with
tessellated
disney
trademarks
and
a
big
pair
of
loose
shorts
and
once
she
donned
them
she
saw
that
she
could
be
anyone
now
any
tourist
in
the
park
a
pair
of
cheap
sunglasses
completed
the
look
and
she
paid
for
it
all
by
waving
her
mickey
necklace
at
the
register
spending
money
like
water
she
passed
the
rest
of
the
day
at
the
magic
kingdom
taking
a
ferry
from
the
hotel
pier
to
the
victorian
docks
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
artificial
lake
as
she
cleared
the
turnstiles
into
main
street
usa
her
heart
quickened
kids
rushed
past
her
chased
by
their
parents
laughing
calls
to
slow
down
balloon
sellers
and
popcorn
machines
jostled
for
space
in
the
crowd
and
a
brass
band
was
marching
down
the
street
in
straw
boaters
and
red
striped
jackets
playing
a
sousa
march
she
ambled
up
the
road
peering
in
the
adorable
little
shop
windows
like
the
shops
in
a
fancy
casino
all
themed
artificial
facades
that
were
in
back
all
one
shop
linked
through
the
length
of
the
street
she
reached
the
castle
before
she
realized
it
and
saw
that
it
was
shorter
than
it
had
appeared
turning
around
and
looking
back
down
main
street
she
saw
that
the
trees
lining
the
sides
of
the
street
had
been
trimmed
so
they
got
progressively
smaller
from
the
gates
to
the
castle
creating
a
kind
of
false
perspective
line
she
laughed
now
amused
by
the
accomplishment
of
the
little
trompe
she
squeezed
past
the
hordes
of
asian
tourists
taking
precisely
the
same
picture
of
the
castle
one
after
another
a
phenomenon
observed
at
other
famous
landmarks
for
some
japanese
shutterbugs
the
holiday
photo
experience
was
as
formal
as
the
stations
of
the
cross
with
each
picture
of
each
landmark
rigidly
prescribed
by
custom
and
unwritten
law
now
she
was
under
the
castle
and
headed
for
what
her
map
assured
her
was
fantasyland
just
as
she
cleared
the
archway
she
remembered
her
conversations
with
that
death
waits
kid
about
fantasyland
this
was
the
part
that
had
been
made
over
as
a
goth
area
and
then
remade
as
the
happiest
construction
site
on
earth
and
so
it
was
the
contrast
was
stark
from
fairy
castle
to
construction
sidings
from
smiling
out
castmembers
to
construction
workers
with
and
grouchy
expressions
fantasyland
was
like
an
ugly
scar
on
the
face
of
a
barbie
doll
she
liked
it
something
about
all
that
artifice
all
that
cunning
work
to
cover
up
all
the
bodies
a
company
like
disney
would
have
buried
under
its
manicured
main
street
it
had
given
her
a
headache
a
kind
of
anger
at
the
falseness
of
it
all
here
she
could
see
the
bodies
as
they
buried
them
out
came
her
camera
and
she
went
on
the
prowl
photographing
and
photographing
seeking
high
ground
from
which
to
catch
snaps
over
the
siding
she
look
at
the
satellite
pics
of
this
spot
later
now
she
knew
what
her
next
project
would
be
she
would
document
this
scar
she
dig
up
the
bodies
just
for
completeness
sake
she
went
on
some
of
the
rides
her
pass
let
her
sail
past
the
long
lines
of
bored
kids
angry
dads
exhausted
moms
she
captured
their
expressions
with
her
camera
the
rides
were
all
right
she
was
sick
of
rides
truth
be
told
as
an
they
were
wildly
overrated
some
of
them
made
her
sick
and
some
of
them
were
like
mildly
interesting
trips
through
collection
of
in
a
dark
room
the
disney
rides
even
let
you
drive
like
lester
ride
did
and
you
did
get
to
vote
on
them
by
the
time
the
sun
had
gone
down
she
was
ready
to
go
back
to
the
room
and
start
writing
she
wanted
to
get
all
this
down
the
beauty
and
the
terror
the
commerce
lurking
underneath
the
friendly
facade
as
the
day
lengthened
into
night
there
were
more
and
more
screaming
children
more
angry
parents
she
caught
parents
smacking
kids
once
twice
got
her
camera
out
caught
three
more
they
sent
a
big
pupu
platter
up
to
her
room
with
a
dish
of
poi
and
a
hollow
pineapple
filled
with
rum
she
took
her
computer
out
onto
her
lanai
and
looked
out
over
the
lake
an
ibis
came
by
and
demanded
some
of
her
dinner
scraps
she
obliged
it
and
it
gave
her
a
cold
look
as
if
determining
whether
she
be
good
for
dessert
then
flew
off
she
began
to
write
something
had
changed
between
kettlewell
and
eva
since
they
left
florida
with
the
kids
it
was
just
the
legal
hassles
though
there
were
plenty
of
those
they
gone
to
florida
with
a
second
chance
a
chance
for
him
to
be
a
mover
again
a
chance
for
her
to
have
a
husband
who
was
happy
with
his
life
again
now
he
found
himself
sneaking
past
her
when
she
was
in
the
living
room
and
they
slept
back
to
back
in
bed
with
as
much
room
between
them
as
possible
ada
missed
lyenitchka
and
spent
all
her
time
in
her
bedroom
iming
her
friend
or
going
questing
with
her
in
their
favorite
game
which
involved
barbies
balrogs
and
buying
outfits
pascal
missed
all
the
attention
he
had
received
as
the
designated
mascot
of
the
two
little
girls
it
was
not
a
high
point
in
the
history
of
the
kettlewell
clan
hello
landon
kettlewell
hello
freddy
he
said
my
fame
precedes
me
the
journalist
said
kettlewell
could
hear
the
grin
in
his
voice
that
voice
was
unmistakable
kettlewell
had
heard
it
in
the
occassional
harassing
voicemail
that
suzanne
forwarded
on
how
are
you

funny
son
of
a
bitch

on
the
story
of
the
litigation
that
perry

and
lester
banks
are
facing
for
unilaterally
canceling
the
arrangement
you
made
to
finance
their
litigation
i
hoping
that
you
give
me
a
quote
that
might
put
this
into
perspective
is
the
defense
off
will
gibbons
and
banks
be
sued
are
you
a
party
to
the
suit
freddy

a
hothead

into
saying
something
i

hung
up
on
you

but
i
will
unless

a
single
good
reason

good

out
of
talking
to
you

to
write
this
story
and
publish
it
today

the
matter

is
fairer
goodbye
freddy
wait
wait
just
wait
kettlewell
liked
the
pleading
note
in
freddy
voice
what
is
it
freddy
can
i
get
you
to
comment
on
the
general
idea
of
litigation
investment
a
lot
of
people
followed
your
lead
in
seeking
out
litigation
investment
opportunities
there
lots
of
money
tied
up
in
it
these
days
do
incidents
like
the
one
in
florida
mean
that
litigation
investment
is
a
dead
strategy
of
course
not
kettlewell
snapped
he
should
be
talking
to
this
man
but
the
question
drove
him
bonkers
he
invented
litigation
investment
those
big
old
companies
have
two
common
characteristics
they
accumulated
more
assets
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
and
they
got
poisonous
monopolistic
cultures
that
reward
executives
who
break
the
law
to
help
the
company
turn
a
buck
none
of
changed
and
so
long
as
that
all
true
there
will
be
little
companies
with
legit
gripes
against
big
companies
that
can
be
used
as
investment
vehicles
for
unlocking
all
that
dead
fortune
capital
and
putting
it
to
work
but
are
fortune
companies
investing
in
litigation
funds
kettlewell
suppressed
a
nasty
laugh
yeah
so
what
well
if
this
is
about
destroying
fortune
companies
it
about
wringing
positive
social
value
out
of
the
courts
and
out
of
investment
the
way
it
used
to
work
there
were
only
two
possible
outcomes
when
a
big
company
did
something
rotten
either
they
get
away
or
they
make
some
lawyers
very
very
rich
litigation
funds
fix
that
they
socialize
the
cost
of
bringing
big
companies
to
heel
and
they
free
up
the
capital
that
these
big
companies
have
accumulated
but
when
a
big
company
invests
in
destroying
another
big
company
sometimes
you
get
a
forest
where
a
few
trees
end
up
winning
they
form
a
canopy
that
keeps
all
the
sunlight
from
reaching
the
floor
now
this
is
stable
for
forests
but
stability
is
the
thing
you
want
in
a
market
just
look
at
what
happens
when
one
of
those
big
trees
falls
over
whoosh
a
million
kinds
of
life
are
spawned
on
the
floor
fighting
for
the
light
that
tree
had
hogged
for
itself
in
a
market
when
you
topple
a
company
that
come
to
complacently
control
some
part
of
the
ecosystem
you
free
up
that
niche
for
new
innovators
and
why
is
that
better
than
stability
do
the
workers
at
these
companies
deserve
the
security
that
comes
from
their
survival
oh
come
on
freddy
stop
beating
that
drum
if
you
an
employee
and
you
want
to
get
a
good
deal
out
of
an
employer
you
better
off
if
you
got
fifty
companies
you
could
work
for
than
just
one
so
you
saying
that
if
you
destroy
disney
with
your
lawsuit
the
fifty
thousand
people
who
work
at
walt
disney
world
will
be
able
to
what
work
for
those
little
rides
like
your
friends
have
built
they
find
lots
of
work
freddy
if
we
make
it
possible
for
anyone
to
open
an
innovative
little
ride
without
worrying
about
getting
clobbered
by
a
big
old
monopolist
you
like
big
corporations
so
much
yes
but
it
not
little
innovative
startups
that
invest
in
these
funds
is
it
it
they
who
benefit
once
the
fund
takes
up
their
cause
and
how
that
working
out
for
the
ride
people
you
meant
to
be
helping
out
they
rejected
you
did
they
kettlewell
really
hated
freddy
he
realized
not
just
a
little
he
had
a
deep
and
genuine
loathing
oh
for
fuck
sake
you
do
like
little
companies
you
do
like
big
companies
you
do
like
workers
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
freddy
you
want
us
to
just
curl
up
under
a
rock
and
die
you
sit
there
and
make
up
your
funny
names
for
things
you
make
your
snarky
little
commentaries
but
how
much
good
have
done
for
the
world
you
complaining
sniping
little
troll
the
line
got
very
quiet
can
i
quote
you
you
certainly
can
kettlewell
huffed
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
you
can
print
that
and
you
can
kiss
my
ass
thank
you
mr
kettlewell
freddy
said
i
certainly
take
the
suggestion
under
advisement
kettlewell
stood
in
his
home
office
and
stared
at
the
four
walls
upstairs
pascal
was
crying
he
did
that
a
lot
lately
kettlewell
breathed
deeply
and
tried
to
chill
out
someone
was
knocking
at
his
door
though
he
answered
it
tentatively
the
kid
he
found
there
was
black
in
his
twenties
and
smiling
amiably
landon
kettlewell
who
suing
me
kettlewell
could
spot
a
process
server
a
mile
away
the
guy
shrugged
and
made
a
little
smile
could
say
sir
he
said
and
handed
kettlewell
the
envelope
holding
it
so
that
the
header
was
clearly
visible
to
the
camera
set
into
the
lapel
of
his
shirt
you
want
me
to
sign
something
kettlewell
said
it
all
right
sir
the
kid
said
and
pointed
at
the
camera
all
caught
on
video
oh
right
kettlewell
said
want
a
cup
of
water
coffee
i
expect
you
going
to
be
too
busy
to
entertain
sir
the
kid
said
and
ticked
a
little
salute
off
his
forehead
but
you
seem
like
a
nice
guy
good
luck
with
it
all
kettlewell
watched
him
go
then
closed
the
door
and
walked
back
to
his
office
opening
the
envelope
and
scanning
it
no
surprises
there
the
shareholders
in
the
investment
syndicate
that
had
backed
lester
and
perry
were
suing
him
for
making
false
representations
about
his
ability
to
speak
for
them
tjan
called
him
a
minute
later
they
got
you
too
huh
kettlewell
said
just
left
wish
i
could
say
it
was
unexpected
wish
i
could
say
i
blamed
them
kettlewell
said
hey
you
should
see
what
the
ride
been
doing
this
week
since
florida
went
down
tjan
said
it
totally
mutated
i
think
mostly
coming
from
the
midwest
though
those
brazilians
seem
to
keep
on
logging
in
somehow
too
how
many
rides
are
there
in
south
america
anyways
brazilians
of
them
tjan
said
with
a
mirthless
chuckle
impossible
to
say
they
got
some
kind
of
variant
on
the
protocol
that
lets
a
bunch
of
them
share
one
network
address
i
think
some
of
them
even
physical
rides
just
virtual
flythroughs
some
are
directly
linked
some
do
a
kind
of
between
their
current
norms
and
other
rides
current
norms
it
pretty
weird
kettlewell
paced
well
at
least
someone
having
a
good
time
they
going
to
nail
us
to
the
wall
tjan
said
both
of
us
probably
the
individual
too
they
out
for
blood
it
not
like
they
even
lost
much
money
they
did
need
to
they
feel
like
they
lost
the
money
they
might
have
won
from
disney
but
that
was
twenty
years
away
and
highly
speculative
tjan
sighed
heavily
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
landon
you
a
very
very
good
finance
person
the
best
i
ever
met
but
you
really
need
to
understand
that
even
the
most
speculative
investor
is
mostly
speculating
about
how
he
going
to
spend
all
the
money
you
about
to
make
him
if
investors
did
count
their
chickens
before
they
hatched
you
never
raise
a
cent
yeah
kettlewell
said
he
knew
it
but
he
could
soak
it
in
won
and
lost
so
many
fortunes
his
own
and
others
that
learned
to
take
it
all
in
stride
not
everyone
else
was
so
sanguine
so
what
do
we
do
about
it
i
do
much
want
to
lose
everything
you
could
always
go
back
to
russia
kettlewell
said
suddenly
feeling
why
did
he
always
have
to
come
up
with
the
plan
sorry
you
know
what
the
lawyers
are
going
to
tell
us
yeah
sue
perry
and
lester
and
we
told
lester
we
would
do
that
it
was
probably
a
mistake
to
do
this
at
all
you
know
no
do
say
that
the
idea
was
a
really
good
one
you
might
have
saved
their
asses
if
they
played
along
and
if
i
kept
the
lawyers
on
a
shorter
leash
they
both
sat
in
glum
silence
how
about
if
we
defend
ourselves
by
producing
evidence
that
they
reneged
on
a
deal
we
made
in
good
faith
then
the
bastards
can
sue
perry
and
lester
and
we
still
be
keeping
our
promise
kettlewell
tried
to
picture
perry
in
a
courtroom
he
never
been
the
most
dude
and
since
he
been
shot
and
had
his
arm
broken
and
been
gassed
he
was
almost
pathological
i
got
a
better
idea
he
said
growing
excited
as
it
unfolded
in
his
mind
he
had
that
burning
sensation
he
got
sometimes
when
he
knew
he
was
having
a
real
doozy
how
about
if
we
approach
each
of
the
individual
ride
and
see
if
they
join
the
lawsuit
separately
from
the
umbrella
org
play
it
right
and
we
have
the
lawsuit
back
on
without
having
to
get
our
asses
handed
to
us
and
without
having
to
destroy
perry
and
lester
tjan
laughed
that
that
wow
genius
yeah
ok
right
the
boston
group
is
in
i
tell
you
that
much
i
sure
we
can
get
half
a
dozen
more
in
too
especially
if
we
can
get
perry
to
agree
not
to
block
it
which
i
sure
he
do
after
i
have
a
little
talk
with
him
this
work
sometimes
the
threat
of
total
legal
destruction
can
have
a
wonderful
clarifying
effect
on
one
mind
kettlewell
said
drily
how
the
kids
lyenitchka
is
in
a
sulk
she
wants
to
go
back
to
florida
and
she
wants
to
see
ada
some
more
plus
she
upset
that
we
never
made
it
to
disney
world
kettlewell
flopped
down
on
his
couch
have
you
seen
suzanne
blog
lately
tjan
laughed
yeah
man
she
giving
it
to
them
with
both
barrels
makes
me
feel
sorry
for
um
you
know
that
we
suing
them
for
everything
they
got
right
well
yes
but
that
just
money
suzanne
going
to
take
their
balls
they
exchanged
some
more
niceties
and
promised
that
they
get
together
real
soon
and
kettlewell
hung
up
from
behind
him
he
heard
someone
fidgeting
kids
you
know
you
are
supposed
to
come
into
my
office
sounds
like
things
have
gotten
started
up
again
it
was
the
kids
it
was
eva
he
sat
up
she
was
standing
with
her
arms
folded
in
the
doorway
of
his
office
staring
at
him
yeah
he
said
mumbling
a
little
she
was
really
beautiful
his
wife
and
she
put
up
with
a
hell
of
a
lot
he
felt
obscurely
ashamed
of
the
way
that
he
treated
her
he
wished
he
could
stand
up
and
give
her
a
warm
hug
he
could
instead
she
sat
beside
him
sounds
like
you
be
busy
oh
i
just
need
to
get
all
the
individual
on
board
talk
to
the
lawyers
get
the
investors
off
my
back
have
a
meeting
it
be
fine
her
smile
was
little
and
sad
i
going
landon
she
said
the
blood
drained
from
his
face
she
left
him
plenty
over
the
years
he
deserved
it
but
it
had
always
been
in
the
middle
of
a
fight
and
it
had
always
ended
with
some
kind
of
reconciliation
this
time
it
had
the
feeling
of
something
planned
and
executed
in
cold
blood
he
sat
up
and
folded
his
hands
in
his
lap
he
did
know
what
else
to
do
her
smile
wilted
it
not
going
to
work
you
and
me
i
ca
live
like
this
lurching
from
crisis
to
crisis
i
love
you
too
much
to
watch
that
happen
i
hate
what
it
turns
me
into
you
only
happy
when
you
miserable
you
know
that
i
ca
do
that
forever
be
part
of
each
others
lives
forever
but
i
ca
be
mrs
stressbunny
forever
none
of
this
was
new
she
shouted
variations
on
this
at
him
at
many
times
in
their
relationship
the
difference
was
that
now
she
shouting
she
was
calm
assured
sad
but
not
crying
behind
her
in
the
hallway
he
saw
that
she
packed
her
suitcase
and
the
little
suitcases
the
kids
used
when
they
travelled
together
where
will
you
go
i
going
to
stay
with
lucy
from
college
she
living
down
the
peninsula
in
mountain
view
she
got
room
for
the
kids
he
felt
like
raging
at
her
promising
her
a
bitter
divorce
and
custody
suit
but
he
could
do
it
she
was
completely
right
after
all
even
though
his
first
impulse
was
to
argue
he
could
do
it
just
then
so
she
left
and
kettlewell
was
alone
in
his
nice
apartment
with
his
phone
and
his
computer
and
his
lawsuits
and
his
mind
fizzing
with
ideas
the
last
thing
sammy
wanted
was
a
fight
dinah
promo
was
making
major
bank
for
the
company
and
he
was
taking
more
and
more
meetings
in
texas
with
dinah
which
was
a
hell
of
a
perk
they
shipped
two
million
of
the
diabs
and
were
projecting
ten
million
in
the
first
quarter
park
admission
was
soaring
and
the
revenue
from
the
advertising
was
going
to
cover
the
entire
cost
of
the
next
rev
of
the
diabs
which
would
be
better
faster
smaller
and
cheaper
that
business
with
death
waits
and
the
new
fantasyland
and
the
ride
what
did
it
matter
now
he
been
so
focused
on
the
details
that
lost
track
of
the
big
picture
walt
disney
had
made
his
empire
by
figuring
out
how
to
do
the
next
thing
not
wasting
his
energy
on
how
to
protect
the
last
thing
it
had
all
been
a
mistake
a
dumb
mistake
and
now
he
was
back
on
track
from
all
appearances
the
lawsuits
were
on
the
verge
of
blowing
away
anyway
fantasyland
he
turned
that
over
to
wiener
of
all
people
and
he
was
actually
doing
some
good
stuff
there
really
running
with
the
idea
of
restoring
it
as
a
nostalgia
site
aimed
squarely
at
fatkins
with
lots
of
food
and
romantic
kiddie
rides
that
no
kid
would
want
to
ride
in
the
age
of
the
coaster
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
a
fight
what
he
wanted
was
to
make
assloads
of
money
for
the
company
remake
himself
as
a
power
in
the
organization
but
he
was
about
to
have
a
fight
hackelberg
came
into
his
office
unannounced
sammy
had
some
of
the
imagineers
in
showing
him
prototypes
of
the
next
model
which
was
being
designed
for
more
reliable
shipping
and
easier
packing
hackelberg
was
carrying
his
cane
today
wearing
his
suit
and
was
flushed
a
deep
angry
red
that
seemed
to
boil
up
from
his
collar
one
look
from
his
blazing
eyes
was
enough
to
send
the
imagineers
scurrying
they
did
even
take
their
prototype
with
them
hackelberg
closed
the
door
behind
them
hello
samuel
he
said
nice
to
see
you
can
i
offer
you
a
glass
of
water
iced
tea
hackelberg
waved
the
offers
away
they
using
your
boxes
to
print
their
own
designs
he
said
what
those
freaks
with
their
ride
they
just
published
a
system
for
printing
their
own
objects
on
your
boxes
sammy
rewound
the
conversations
he
had
with
the
infosec
people
in
imagineering
about
what
countermeasures
they
come
up
with
what
they
were
proof
against
he
was
pissed
that
he
was
finding
out
about
this
from
hackelberg
if
lester
and
perry
were
hacking
the
diabs
they
would
be
talking
about
it
nonstop
running
their
mouths
on
the
internet
back
when
he
was
his
own
competitive
intelligence
specialist
he
would
have
known
about
this
project
the
second
it
began
now
he
was
trying
to
find
a
competitive
intelligence
person
who
knew
his
ass
from
his
elbow
so
far
without
success
well
that
regrettable
obviously
but
so
long
as
we
still
selling
the
consumables
the
goop
was
a
huge
for
the
company
they
bought
it
in
bulk
added
a
proprietary
precisely
mixed
chemical
that
the
printer
could
check
for
in
its
hoppers
and
sold
it
to
the
diab
users
for
a
two
thousand
percent
markup
if
you
tried
to
substitute
a
competitor
goop
the
machine
would
reject
it
they
shipped
out
new
diabs
with
only
half
a
load
of
goop
so
that
the
first
purchase
would
come
fast
it
was
making
more
money
than
popcorn
the
crack
they
distributing
also
disables
the
checking
for
the
watermark
you
can
use
any
generic
goop
in
them
sammy
shook
his
head
and
restrained
himself
from
thumping
his
hand
down
on
the
desk
he
wanted
to
scream
we
not
suing
them
are
we
do
you
think
that
wise
samuel
i
no
legal
expert
you
tell
me
maybe
we
can
take
stronger
countermeasures
with
the
next
generation
he
gestured
at
the
prototype
on
his
desk
and
abandon
the
two
million
units
we
shipped
to
date
sammy
thought
about
it
those
families
might
hang
on
to
their
original
two
million
forever
or
until
they
wore
out
maybe
he
should
be
building
them
to
fall
apart
after
six
months
of
use
to
force
updates
it
just
so
unfair
they
ripping
us
off
we
spent
the
money
on
those
units
so
that
we
could
send
our
message
out
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
those
people
are
they
compulsive
do
they
to
destroy
every
business
hackelberg
sat
back
samuel
i
think
it
time
we
dealt
with
them
sammy
mind
was
still
off
on
the
strategies
for
keeping
lester
and
perry
at
bay
though
sure
a
obsolescence
curve
would
do
it
or
they
could
just
charge
money
for
the
diabs
now
that
people
were
starting
to
understand
what
they
were
for
hell
they
could
just
make
the
most
compelling
stuff
for
a
diab
to
print
and
maybe
that
would
be
enough
hackelberg
tapped
the
tip
of
his
cane
once
sharply
sammy
came
back
to
the
conversation
so
that
settled
filing
suit
today
going
to
do
a
discovery
on
them
that
split
them
open
from
asshole
to
throat
no
more
of
this
chickenshit
police
stuff
we
going
to
figure
out
every
source
of
income
these
bastards
have
we
going
to
take
away
their
computers
we
going
down
to
their
isps
and
getting
their
emails
and
instant
messages
and
as
we
seen
they
going
to
retaliate
that
fine
we
not
treating
these
people
as
a
couple
of
punk
pirates
who
go
down
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble
not
anymore
we
know
that
these
people
are
the
competition
we
going
to
make
an
example
of
them
they
the
first
ones
to
attack
on
this
front
but
they
wo
be
the
last
vulnerable
samuel
but
we
can
contain
that
vulnerability
with
enough
deterrent
hackelberg
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
of
sammy
but
sammy
was
damned
if
he
knew
what
it
was
ok
he
said
lamely
hackelberg
smile
was
like
a
jack
that
means
that
got
to
be
prepared
for
their
discovery
on
i
need
to
know
every
single
detail
of
this
diab
project
including
the
things
i
find
if
i
went
through
your
phone
records
and
your
email
because
they
be
going
through
them
they
be
putting
you
and
your
operation
under
the
microscope
sammy
restrained
his
groan
i
have
it
for
you
he
said
give
me
a
day
or
two
he
saw
hackelberg
out
of
his
office
as
quickly
as
he
could
then
shut
the
door
hackelberg
wanted
everything
and
that
meant
including
his
playmates
from
the
advertising
industry
everything
he
was
becoming
the
kind
of
executive
who
emitted
strategic
intelligence
rather
than
the
kind
who
gathered
it
that
would
do
that
was
the
natural
order
of
things
he
sat
down
at
his
computer
someone
had
to
do
the
competitive
intelligence
work
around
here
and
it
looked
like
it
would
have
to
be
him
what
the
world
can
learn
from
disney
suzanne
church
it
easy
to
dismiss
disney
they
make
more
lawsuits
than
rides
these
days
they
have
a
reputation
for
polyannaish
chirpiness
their
corporate
communications
veer
from
corporate
passive
voice
third
person
to
a
syrupy
condescending
that
calculated
to
drive
children
into
a
frenzy
of
screeches
but
if
you
have
been
to
a
disney
park
in
a
while
you
do
know
what
you
missing
i
been
in
walt
disney
world
for
a
week
now
and
i
here
to
tell
you
it
pretty
good
no
it
better
than
that
it
you
probably
heard
about
the
attention
to
detail
the
roofline
over
fantasyland
features
sagging
georgian
tiles
crazy
chimneys
and
subtly
animated
gargoyles
left
over
from
a
previous
incarnation
of
this
part
of
the
park
you
do
see
this
unless
you
raise
your
eyes
above
the
busy
intriguing
facades
that
front
the
rides
above
the
masterfully
painted
signage
and
higher
still
in
other
words
unless
you
someone
like
me
looking
for
details
you
wo
spot
them
they
there
as
pure
they
there
because
someone
who
took
pride
in
his
work
them
it
tells
you
something
about
the
people
behind
the
scenes
here
people
who
care
about
their
jobs
work
here
it
easy
to
forget
that
when
you
thinking
about
disney
a
company
whose
reputation
these
days
has
more
to
do
with
whom
they
sue
than
with
what
they
make
but
oh
what
they
make
there
a
safari
park
here
something
like
a
zoo
but
without
that
stuff
that
makes
you
feel
like
participating
in
some
terrible
exercise
that
strips
noble
animals
of
their
dignity
for
our
amusement
instead
the
animals
here
roam
free
near
their
hairless
monkey
cousins
separated
from
them
by
water
features
camouflaged
ditches
simulated
ancient
ruins
more
details
that
just
one
of
six
parks
each
subdivided
into
six
or
seven
lands
each
land
with
its
own
unique
charm
culture
and
customs
that
not
counting
the
outlying
areas
two
new
towns
golf
courses
a
velodrome
a
preserved
marshland
that
you
can
tour
in
a
skiff
with
a
local
naturist
in
these
days
of
cheap
fabrication
easy
to
forget
what
you
can
do
with
several
billion
dollars
and
the
kind
of
hubris
that
leads
you
to
dredge
lakes
erect
papier
mache
mountains
and
create
your
own
toy
system
of
course
disney
parks
are
no
strangers
to
small
scale
fabrication
see
their
tiny
clever
devices
which
i
have
chronicled
here
from
the
other
side
on
the
one
hand
these
things
are
networked
volumetric
printers
but
on
the
other
they
are
superb
that
have
achieved
an
entirely
justifiable
yet
still
staggering
market
penetration
in
just
a
few
months
i
came
here
ready
to
be
bored
and
disgusted
and
fleeced
of
every
nickel
i
am
disappointed
the
parks
are
tremendous
at
separating
people
from
money
it
true
they
structured
each
promenade
and
stroll
so
that
even
a
walk
to
the
bathroom
can
create
a
situation
for
such
a
happy
place
there
certainly
are
a
lot
of
weepy
children
and
frustrated
parents
but
it
hard
to
fault
disney
for
being
a
business
that
makes
a
lot
of
money
that
the
point
after
all
and
it
ca
be
cheap
to
keep
the
tens
of
thousands
of
castmembers
yes
they
really
do
call
them
that
even
when
they
earning
minimum
wage
and
work
jobs
with
all
the
glamour
of
a
bathroom
attendant
hanging
around
picking
up
litter
and
confronting
every
new
guest
with
eerily
convincing
cheer
as
for
bored
and
disgusted
not
yet
bored
it
impossible
to
imagine
such
a
thing
for
starters
the
world
middle
classes
have
converged
here
in
a
sort
of
bourgeois
un
and
you
can
get
a
lot
of
pleasure
out
of
watching
a
chinese
little
emperor
with
doting
parents
in
tow
making
friends
with
a
tiny
perfect
russian
mafiyeh
princess
whose
parents
flick
nervously
at
their
nicotine
inhalers
and
scout
the
building
facades
for
hidden
cameras
of
course
if
is
your
thing
there
are
the
rides
themselves
which
make
art
out
of
the
shoebox
diorama
there
are
luaus
indoor
scuba
diving
with
live
sharks
and
an
island
of
genuinely
sleazy
nightclubs
where
you
can
get
propositioned
for
some
improbable
acts
that
are
hardly
family
friendly
these
last
appear
to
be
largely
populated
by
the
castmembers
seeking
a
little
action
disgusted
i
think
if
i
were
a
parent
there
be
parts
of
the
experience
that
drove
me
nuts
but
once
you
get
to
know
the
rhythm
of
the
place
you
start
to
see
that
there
are
navigable
pathways
that
do
lead
through
any
commercial
areas
fantastic
adventure
playgrounds
nature
hikes
petting
zoos
horseback
rides
sports
training
and
for
every
kid
who
having
a
meltdown
after
consuming
half
a
quart
of
lube
slathered
on
a
cinnamon
bun
there
another
who
is
standing
with
complete
bodily
wonder
at
some
stupendous
spectacle
clearly
forming
neuronal
connections
of
a
sort
that
will
create
the
permanent
predisposition
to
an
appreciation
of
spectacle
wonder
and
beauty
this
is
the
kind
of
place
where
you
have
to
love
the
sin
and
hate
the
sinner
the
company
may
sue
and
resort
to
dirty
tricks
but
it
also
chock
full
of
real
artists
making
real
art
if
you
have
been
for
a
visit
you
should
honestly
oh
by
all
means
also
go
somewhere
unspoiled
if
you
can
find
it
go
camping
go
to
one
of
the
rides
i
written
so
much
about
but
if
you
want
to
see
the
bright
side
of
what
billions
can
do
the
stuff
you
never
get
from
outside
the
walls
of
this
fortress
of
fun
buy
a
ticket
the
barman
at
suzanne
hotel
started
building
her
a
as
she
came
up
the
stairs
the
drink
involved
a
hollow
pineapple
overproof
rum
and
an
umbrella
and
she
concluded
that
it
contained
the
perfect
dosage
of
liquid
cns
depressant
to
unwind
her
after
a
day
of
battle
at
the
parks
that
day
she
spent
following
around
the
troupes
of
actors
at
disney
hollwood
studios
a
cast
of
a
hundred
costumed
players
who
acted
out
a
series
of
interlocking
comedies
set
in
the
days
of
hollywood
they
were
fearlessly
cheeky
grabbing
audience
members
and
conscripting
them
in
their
plays
now
she
was
footsore
and
there
was
still
a
nighttime
at
epcot
in
her
future
the
barman
passed
her
the
pineapple
and
she
thumped
her
lanyard
against
the
bar
twice
once
to
pay
for
the
drink
and
once
to
give
him
a
generous
tip
he
was
gay
as
a
goose
but
fun
to
look
at
and
he
flirted
with
her
for
kicks
gentleman
caller
for
you
suzanne
he
said
tilting
his
head
you
temptress
she
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
and
took
in
the
man
sitting
on
the
he
did
have
the
look
of
a
harried
dad
and
he
was
too
old
to
be
a
honeymooner
in
sensible
slacks
and
a
western
shirt
he
was
impossible
to
place
he
smiled
and
gave
her
a
little
wave
what
he
came
in
an
hour
ago
and
asked
for
you
she
looked
back
at
the
man
what
your
take
on
him
i
think
he
works
here
he
did
pay
with
an
employee
card
but
he
acted
like
it
ok
she
said
send
out
a
search
party
if
i
not
back
in
an
hour
go
get
him
tiger
the
barman
said
giving
her
hand
a
squeeze
she
carried
her
pineapple
with
her
and
drifted
down
the
bar
hello
there
she
said
ms
church
the
man
said
he
had
a
disarming
confident
smile
my
name
is
sammy
page
she
knew
the
name
of
course
the
face
too
now
that
she
thought
about
it
he
offered
her
his
hand
she
did
take
it
he
put
it
down
then
wiped
it
on
his
are
you
having
a
good
time
a
lovely
time
thank
you
she
sipped
her
drink
and
wished
it
was
a
little
more
serious
and
intimidating
it
hard
to
do
frosty
when
you
holding
a
pineapple
with
a
paper
parasol
his
smile
faltered
i
read
your
article
i
ca
believe
i
missed
it
i
mean
you
been
here
for
six
days
and
i
just
figured
it
out
today
i
a
pretty
incompetent
villain
she
let
a
little
smile
slip
out
at
that
well
it
a
big
internet
but
i
your
stuff
i
been
reading
it
since
well
back
when
i
lived
in
the
valley
i
used
to
get
the
merc
actually
delivered
on
paper
you
are
a
walking
fossil
are
you
he
bobbed
his
head
so
it
comes
down
to
this
i
been
very
distracted
with
making
things
besides
lawsuits
lately
as
you
know
i
been
putting
my
energy
into
doing
stuff
not
preventing
stuff
it
been
refreshing
she
grubbed
in
her
pocket
and
came
up
with
a
little
steno
book
and
a
pencil
do
you
mind
if
i
take
notes
he
gulped
can
this
all
be
on
background
she
hefted
her
notebook
no
she
said
finally
if
there
anything
that
needs
publishing
i
going
to
have
to
publish
it
i
can
respect
the
fact
that
you
speaking
to
me
with
candor
but
frankly
mr
page
you
have
earned
the
privilege
of
speaking
on
background
he
sipped
at
his
drink
a
more
highball
with
a
lone
in
it
maybe
a
scotch
and
soda
ok
right
well
then
on
the
record
but
candorously
i
loved
your
article
i
love
your
work
in
general
i
really
glad
to
have
you
here
because
i
think
we
make
great
stuff
and
we
making
more
of
it
than
ever
your
latest
post
was
right
on
the
money
we
care
about
our
work
here
that
how
we
got
to
where
we
are
but
you
devote
a
lot
of
your
resources
to
other
projects
here
you
i
heard
about
you
mr
page
i
interviewed
death
waits
he
winced
and
she
scribbled
a
note
leaving
him
on
tenterhooks
while
she
wrote
something
cold
and
angry
had
hold
of
her
writing
arm
interviewed
him
and
heard
what
he
has
to
say
about
this
place
what
you
have
done
my
hands
are
the
cleanest
he
said
but
i
trying
to
atone
he
swallowed
the
barman
was
looking
at
them
look
can
i
take
you
for
a
walk
maybe
someplace
more
private
she
thought
about
it
let
me
get
changed
she
said
meet
you
in
the
lobby
in
ten
she
swapped
her
tennis
shoes
for
walking
sandals
and
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
long
slacks
then
draped
a
scarf
over
her
shoulders
like
a
shawl
outside
the
sunset
was
painting
the
lagoon
bloody
she
was
just
about
to
rush
back
down
to
the
lobby
when
she
stopped
and
called
lester
her
fingers
moving
of
their
own
volition
hey
you
he
said
still
having
fun
in
mauschwitz
it
keeps
getting
weirder
here
let
me
tell
you
she
said
she
told
him
about
sammy
showing
up
wanting
to
talk
with
her
ooh
i
jealous
lester
said
he
my
after
all
i
had
thought
of
it
that
way
he
kind
of
cute
hey
in
a
slimy
sharky
way
do
worry
lester
i
miss
you
you
know
really
really
i
think
i
about
done
here
i
going
to
come
home
soon
there
was
a
long
pause
then
a
snuffling
sound
she
realized
he
was
crying
he
slurped
sorry
that
great
babe
i
missed
you
i
i
missed
you
too
listen
i
got
to
go
meet
this
guy
go
go
call
me
after
dinner
and
tell
me
how
it
goes
meanwhile
going
to
go
violate
the
diab
some
more
channel
it
that
right
right
on
sammy
met
her
in
the
lobby
i
thought
we
could
go
for
a
walk
around
the
lake
he
said
there
a
trail
that
goes
all
the
way
around
it
pretty
private
she
looked
at
the
lake
at
twelve
the
main
gates
of
the
magic
kingdom
at
three
the
retro
contemporary
hotel
at
nine
the
grand
floridian
resort
lead
on
she
said
he
led
her
out
onto
the
artificial
beach
and
around
and
a
moment
later
they
were
on
a
pathway
paved
with
octagonal
tiles
each
engraved
with
the
name
of
a
family
and
a
year
i
really
liked
your
article
you
said
that
they
walked
a
while
longer
it
reminded
me
of
why
i
came
here
i
worked
for
startups
and
they
were
fun
but
they
were
ephemeral
no
one
expected
something
on
the
web
to
last
for
half
a
century
maybe
the
brand
survives
but
who
knows
i
mean
who
remembers
yahoo
anymore
but
for
sure
anything
you
built
then
would
be
gone
in
a
year
or
two
a
decade
tops
but
here
he
waved
his
hands
they
were
coming
around
the
bend
for
the
contemporary
now
and
she
could
see
it
in
all
its
absurd
glory
it
had
been
kept
up
so
that
it
looked
like
it
might
have
been
erected
yesterday
but
the
towering
white
structure
with
the
monorail
running
through
its
midriff
was
clearly
of
another
era
it
was
like
a
museum
piece
or
a
bit
of
artillery
on
the
field
at
a
civil
war
reenactment
i
see
it
about
the
grandiosity
the
permanence
the
belief
in
doing
something
anything
that
will
endure
you
did
need
to
bring
me
someplace
private
to
tell
me
that
no
i
did
he
swallowed
it
hard
because
i
want
to
tell
you
something
that
will
compromise
me
if
i
say
it
and
i
wo
let
you
off
the
hook
by
promising
to
keep
it
confidential
exactly
well
you
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
then
are
you
the
sun
was
nearly
set
now
and
stones
at
their
feet
glittered
from
beneath
sprinkled
with
twinkling
lights
it
made
the
evening
scented
with
tropical
flowers
and
the
clean
smell
of
the
lake
even
more
lovely
a
cool
breeze
fluffed
her
hair
he
groaned
she
had
to
admit
it
she
was
enjoying
this
was
it
any
less
than
this
man
deserved
let
me
try
this
again
i
have
some
information
that
if
i
pass
it
on
to
you
could
save
your
friends
down
in
hollywood
from
terrible
harm
i
can
only
give
you
this
information
on
the
condition
that
you
take
great
pains
to
keep
me
from
being
identified
as
the
source
they
come
to
the
magic
kingdom
now
behind
them
the
main
gates
loomed
and
a
pufferbelly
train
blew
its
whistle
as
it
pulled
out
of
the
station
happy
exhausted
children
ran
across
the
plaza
heading
for
the
ferry
docks
and
the
monorail
ramps
the
stones
beneath
her
feet
glittered
with
rainbow
light
and
tropical
birds
called
to
each
other
from
the
pirates
of
the
caribbean
adventure
island
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
hum
she
said
the
families
laughed
and
jostled
each
other
hum
ok
one
time
only
this
one
is
off
the
record
sammy
looked
around
nervously
keep
walking
he
said
let
get
past
here
and
back
into
the
private
spots
it
the
crowds
that
put
me
in
a
generous
mood
she
did
say
it
she
give
him
this
one
what
harm
could
it
do
if
it
was
something
she
had
to
publish
she
could
get
it
from
another
source
they
going
to
sue
your
friends
so
what
else
is
new
no
personally
they
going
to
the
mattresses
every
trumped
up
charge
they
can
think
of
but
the
point
here
is
to
get
the
cops
to
raid
them
it
to
serve
discovery
on
every
single
communication
every
document
every
file
open
up
everything
root
through
every
email
until
they
find
something
to
hang
them
with
you
say
are
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
now
but
she
could
tell
the
question
made
him
uncomfortable
no
not
anymore
he
swallowed
and
looked
out
at
the
lake
look
doing
something
now
something
the
diab
it
breaking
new
ground
we
putting
printers
into
every
house
in
america
what
your
friend
lester
is
doing
it
actually
us
we
inventing
a
whole
new
business
no
not
just
a
business
a
world
it
what
the
new
work
was
missing
a
printer
in
every
living
room
a
killer
app
there
were
personal
computers
and
geeks
for
years
before
the
spreadsheet
came
along
then
there
was
a
reason
to
put
one
in
every
house
then
we
got
the
internet
the
whole
software
industry
a
new
world
that
where
we
headed
it
all
i
want
to
do
i
do
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
suing
people
i
want
to
he
kicked
at
the
rushes
that
grew
beside
the
trail
i
want
to
be
remembered
for
that
i
want
to
be
my
place
in
the
history
books
not
a
bunch
of
lawsuits
suzanne
walked
along
beside
him
in
silence
for
a
time
ok
so
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it
i
thought
that
if
he
shut
up
look
i
tried
this
once
before
i
told
that
freddy
bastard
everything
in
the
hopes
that
he
come
onto
my
side
and
help
me
out
he
screwed
me
i
not
saying
you
freddy
but
suzanne
stopped
walking
what
do
you
want
from
me
sir
you
have
hardly
been
a
friend
to
me
and
mine
it
true
that
you
made
something
very
fine
but
it
also
true
that
you
helped
sabotage
something
every
bit
as
fine
you
painting
yourself
as
the
victim
of
some
mysterious
but
as
near
as
i
can
work
out
the
only
difference
between
you
and
is
that
you
having
a
little
disagreement
with
them
i
do
like
to
be
used
as
part
of
your
corporate
and
fine
he
said
fine
i
deserve
that
i
deserve
no
better
fine
well
i
tried
suzanne
refused
to
soften
grown
men
sulking
did
not
inspire
any
sympathy
in
her
whatever
he
wanted
to
tell
her
it
was
worth
going
into
his
debt
he
gave
a
shuddering
sigh
well
i
taken
you
away
from
your
evening
of
fun
can
i
make
it
up
to
you
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
on
some
of
my
favorite
rides
this
surprised
her
a
little
but
when
she
thought
about
it
she
could
see
why
not
sure
she
said
taking
a
guest
around
disney
world
was
like
programming
a
playlist
for
a
date
or
a
sammy
had
done
it
three
or
four
times
for
people
he
was
trying
to
win
over
mostly
women
he
was
trying
to
screw
and
he
refined
his
technique
every
time
so
he
took
her
to
the
carousel
of
progress
it
was
the
oldest
untouched
ride
in
the
park
a
replica
of
the
one
that
walt
himself
had
built
for
ge
at
the
world
fair
there
had
been
attempts
to
update
it
over
the
years
but
they
all
been
ripped
out
and
the
show
restored
to
its
glory
it
was
a
revolving
theater
where
robots
danced
and
sang
and
talked
through
the
american
century
from
the
last
days
of
the
coal
stove
up
to
the
dawn
of
the
space
age
it
had
a
goofy
catchy
song
cornball
jokes
and
he
relished
playing
guide
and
telling
his
charges
about
the
time
that
the
revolving
theater
had
trapped
a
careless
castmember
in
its
carousel
and
crushed
her
to
death
that
juxtaposition
of
sunny
goofy
american
corporate
optimism
and
the
macabre
realities
of
operating
a
park
where
a
gang
of
workers
spent
their
days
shovelling
the
world
rich
children
into
modified
threshing
machines
it
was
delicious
suzanne
body
language
told
him
the
whole
story
from
the
second
she
sat
down
arms
folded
a
barely
contained
smirk
on
her
lips
the
lights
played
over
the
ge
logo
which
had
acquired
an
even
more
anachronistic
luster
since
the
last
time
he
been
now
that
ge
had
been
from
the
nyse
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
they
yanked
the
sponsorship
but
for
now
it
made
the
ride
seem
like
it
was
part
transported
back
to
the
corporate
pleistocene
when
giant
dinocorps
thundered
over
the
plains
the
theater
rotated
to
the
first
batch
of
singing
robots
her
eyebrows
shot
up
and
she
shook
her
head
bemusedly
out
came
the
second
batch
the
third
now
they
were
in
the
fabulous
forties
and
the
andrews
sisters
played
while
grandma
and
grandpa
robot
watched
a
bulging
tv
and
sister
got
vibrated
by
an
electric
slimming
belt
the
jokes
got
worse
the
catchy
jingle
there
a
great
big
beautiful
tomorrow
shining
at
the
end
of
every
daaaaay
got
repeated
with
more
vigor
it
like
an
american
robot
performance
of
of
the
she
whispered
to
him
and
he
cracked
up
they
were
the
only
two
in
the
theater
it
was
never
full
and
he
himself
had
taken
part
in
spitball
exercises
brainstorming
replacements
but
institutionally
disney
parks
could
bring
itself
to
shut
it
down
there
was
always
some
excuse
rabid
fans
historical
interest
competing
priorities
but
it
came
down
to
the
fact
that
no
one
wanted
to
bring
the
axe
down
on
the
robot
family
the
final
segment
now
the
whole
family
enjoying
a
futuristic
christmas
with
a
kitchen
whose
stove
went
haywire
all
the
robots
were
on
stage
for
the
segment
and
they
exhorted
the
audience
to
sing
and
clap
along
sammy
gave
in
and
clapped
and
a
second
later
suzanne
did
too
laughing
at
the
silliness
of
it
all
when
the
house
lights
came
up
and
the
bored
but
unsquashed
castmember
spieled
them
out
of
the
ride
sammy
had
a
bounce
in
his
step
and
the
song
in
his
head
that
was
suzanne
said
is
it
great
god
i
never
get
that
song
out
of
my
head
they
moved
through
the
flashing
lights
of
tomorrowland
look
at
that
no
line
on
space
mountain
sammy
said
pointing
so
they
rode
space
mountain
twice
then
they
caught
the
fireworks
then
sammy
took
her
over
to
tom
sawyer
island
on
a
maintenance
boat
and
they
sat
up
in
the
tree
house
and
watched
as
the
park
heaved
and
thronged
danced
and
ran
laughed
and
chattered
hear
the
rustling
yeah
what
is
that
rabbits
or
something
giant
rats
sammy
grinned
in
the
dark
giant
feral
rats
come
on
you
joking
cross
my
heart
we
drain
the
lake
every
now
and
then
and
they
migrate
to
the
island
no
predators
lots
of
dropped
french
fries
ratopia
here
they
get
as
big
as
cats
bold
little
fuckers
too
no
one
likes
to
be
here
alone
at
night
what
about
us
we
together
the
rustling
grew
louder
and
they
held
their
breath
a
bold
rat
like
a
raccoon
picked
its
way
across
the
path
below
them
then
two
more
suzanne
shivered
and
sammy
did
too
they
were
huge
feral
menacing
want
to
go
hell
she
said
she
fumbled
in
her
purse
and
came
out
with
a
bright
little
torch
that
shone
like
a
beacon
you
were
supposed
to
use
bright
lights
on
the
island
after
hours
while
the
rest
of
the
park
was
open
but
sammy
was
glad
of
it
back
on
the
mainland
they
rode
big
thunder
mountain
and
moseyed
over
to
the
new
fantasyland
the
zombie
maze
was
still
open
and
they
got
lost
in
it
amid
the
groans
animatronic
shamblers
and
giggling
kids
running
through
the
hedges
something
happened
in
the
maze
between
entering
it
and
leaving
it
they
lost
their
cares
instead
of
talking
about
the
park
and
hackelberg
they
talked
about
ways
of
getting
out
of
the
maze
talked
about
which
zombie
was
coming
next
about
the
best
zombie
movies
they
ever
seen
about
memorable
halloweens
as
they
neared
the
exit
they
started
to
strategize
about
the
best
ride
to
go
on
next
suzanne
had
done
the
haunted
mansion
twice
when
she
first
arrived
and
now
come
on
it
such
a
cliche
sammy
said
anyone
can
be
a
haunted
mansion
fan
it
like
being
a
mickey
fan
it
takes
real
character
to
be
a
goofy
fan
you
a
goofy
fan
i
take
it
indeed
and
i
also
a
jungle
cruise
man
more
corny
jokes
been
to
have
you
talk
about
cornball
humor
they
rode
both
the
park
was
closing
and
all
around
them
people
were
streaming
away
from
the
rides
no
lines
at
all
not
even
in
front
of
the
rollercoasters
not
even
in
front
of
dumbo
not
even
in
front
of
the
of
the
world
of
the
zombies
nee
peter
pan
flight
and
a
perennial
favorite
you
know
i
have
just
the
park
like
this
in
years
he
was
wearing
a
huge
foam
goofy
hat
that
danced
and
bobbed
on
his
head
trying
to
do
little
with
the
other
goofy
hats
in
the
vicinity
it
also
let
out
the
occassional
chuckle
and
snatch
of
song
shut
up
suzanne
said
do
talk
about
magic
live
magic
they
closed
the
park
letting
themselves
get
herded
off
of
main
street
along
with
the
last
stragglers
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
they
moved
through
the
arches
under
the
the
night
crew
was
moving
through
the
empty
main
street
hosing
down
the
streets
sweeping
scrubbing
as
he
watched
the
work
lights
came
on
throwing
the
whole
thing
into
illumination
making
it
seem
less
like
an
enchanted
wonderland
and
more
like
a
movie
set
an
artifice
a
sham
it
was
one
in
the
morning
and
he
was
exhausted
and
hackelberg
was
going
to
sue
sammy
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
blackmail
him
i
do
know
sure
why
not
you
could
call
him
and
say
hear
you
working
on
this
lawsuit
but
do
you
think
it
hypocritical
when
you
been
doing
all
this
bad
stuff
i
do
blackmail
people
fine
tell
your
friends
then
tell
some
lawyers
that
could
work
sammy
i
think
we
going
to
have
to
fight
this
suit
on
its
merits
not
on
the
basis
of
some
sneaky
intel
i
appreciate
the
risk
putting
yourself
to
we
ripped
off
some
of
lester
code
for
the
diab
he
blurted
it
out
not
believing
he
was
hearing
himself
say
it
i
did
know
it
at
the
time
the
libraries
were
on
the
net
and
my
guys
were
in
a
hurry
and
they
just
imported
it
into
the
build
and
left
it
there
they
rewrote
it
with
the
second
shipment
but
we
put
out
a
million
units
running
a
library
lester
wrote
for
volumetric
imaging
it
was
under
some
crazy
viral
open
source
license
and
we
were
supposed
to
publish
all
our
modifications
and
we
never
did
suzanne
threw
her
head
back
and
laughed
long
and
hard
sammy
found
himself
laughing
along
with
her
ok
she
said
that
a
good
one
i
tell
lester
about
it
maybe
he
want
to
use
it
maybe
he
want
to
sue
sammy
wanted
to
ask
her
if
she
keep
his
name
out
of
it
but
he
could
ask
he
gone
to
hackelberg
with
the
info
as
soon
as
found
out
and
they
agreed
to
keep
it
quiet
the
imagineers
responsible
had
had
a
very
firm
talking
to
and
had
privately
admitted
to
a
curious
and
aghast
sammy
over
beers
that
everyone
everywhere
did
this
all
the
time
that
it
was
so
normal
as
to
be
completely
unremarkable
he
was
pretty
sure
that
a
judge
would
see
it
that
way
suzanne
surprised
him
by
giving
him
a
strong
warm
hug
you
not
the
worst
guy
in
the
world
sammy
page
she
said
thanks
for
showing
me
around
your
park
kettlewell
had
been
almost
pathetic
in
his
interest
in
helping
lester
out
lester
got
the
impression
that
he
been
sitting
around
his
apartment
moping
ever
since
eva
had
taken
the
kids
and
gone
as
lester
unspooled
the
story
for
him
suzanne
would
tell
him
how
she
found
this
out
and
he
knew
better
than
to
ask
kettlewell
grew
more
and
more
excited
by
the
time
lester
was
through
he
was
practically
slobbering
into
the
phone
oh
oh
oh
this
is
going
to
be
a
phoner
he
said
you
do
it
then
even
after
everything
does
perry
know
you
called
me
lester
swallowed
no
he
said
i
do
talk
to
perry
much
these
days
kettlewell
sighed
what
the
hell
am
i
going
to
do
with
you
two
i
sorry
lester
said
do
be
sorry
be
happy
someone
should
be
happy
around
here
herve
guignol
chaired
the
executive
committee
sammy
had
known
him
for
years
they
come
east
together
from
san
jose
where
guignol
had
run
the
entertainment
side
of
ebay
they
been
recruited
by
disney
parks
at
the
same
time
during
the
hostile
takeover
and
breakup
and
had
their
share
of
nights
out
golf
games
and
stupid
movies
together
but
when
guignol
was
wearing
his
chairman
hat
it
was
like
he
was
a
different
person
the
boardroom
was
filled
with
huge
ergonomic
chairs
the
center
of
the
table
lined
with
bottles
of
imported
water
and
trays
of
fanciful
canapes
in
the
shapes
of
disney
characters
sammy
sat
to
guignol
left
and
hackelberg
sat
to
his
right
guignol
brought
the
meeting
to
order
and
the
rest
of
the
committee
stopped
chatting
and
checking
email
and
looked
expectant
at
the
touch
of
a
button
the
door
swung
shut
with
an
authoritative
clunk
and
shutters
slid
down
over
the
window
welcome
and
thank
you
for
attending
on
such
short
notice
you
know
augustus
hackelberg
he
has
something
to
present
to
you
hackelberg
climbed
to
his
feet
and
looked
out
at
them
he
did
look
good
an
issue
has
arisen
sammy
loved
the
third
person
passive
voice
that
dominated
corporate
meetings
like
the
issue
had
arisen
all
on
its
own
spontaneously
a
decision
that
was
taken
has
come
back
to
bite
us
he
explained
about
the
diabs
and
the
code
laying
it
out
more
or
less
as
it
happened
though
of
course
he
downplayed
his
involvement
in
advising
sammy
to
go
ahead
and
ship
the
committee
asked
a
few
intense
questions
none
directed
at
sammy
who
kept
quiet
though
he
instinctively
wanted
to
defend
his
record
they
took
a
break
after
an
hour
and
sammy
found
himself
in
a
corner
with
guignol
what
do
you
think
sammy
asked
him
guignol
grimaced
i
think
we
pretty
screwed
someone
is
going
to
have
to
take
a
fall
for
this
you
know
it
going
to
cost
us
a
fortune
sammy
nodded
well
unless
we
just
settle
with
them
he
said
you
know
we
drop
the
suit
we
just
filed
and
they
drop
theirs
he
had
hoped
that
this
would
come
out
on
its
own
but
it
was
clear
that
hackelberg
was
going
to
offer
it
up
himself
he
was
too
in
love
with
the
idea
of
getting
his
hands
on
perry
and
lester
guignol
rocked
his
head
from
side
to
side
you
think
they
go
for
it
sammy
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
turned
away
from
the
rest
of
the
room
to
confound
any
i
think
they
to
do
that
guignol
cut
his
eyes
over
to
hackelberg
and
sammy
nodded
imperceptibly
guignol
moved
away
leaving
sammy
to
eat
a
mickey
head
built
from
chunks
of
salmon
and
hamachi
guignol
moved
among
the
committee
talking
to
a
few
members
sammy
recognized
the
behavior
consolidating
power
hard
to
remember
that
this
was
the
guy
played
savage
games
of
golf
with
the
meeting
reconvened
no
one
looked
at
sammy
they
all
looked
at
hackelberg
what
about
trying
to
settle
the
suit
guignol
said
hackelberg
flushed
i
do
know
if
that
possible
what
about
if
we
offer
to
settle
in
exchange
for
dropping
the
suit
we
just
filed
hackelberg
hands
squeezed
the
side
of
the
table
i
do
think
that
that
would
be
a
wise
course
of
action
this
is
the
opportunity
been
waiting
for
the
chance
to
crack
them
wide
open
and
see
going
on
inside
discover
just
what
they
taken
from
us
and
how
out
them
for
all
their
bad
acts
guignol
nodded
ok
that
true
now
as
i
understand
it
every
diab
we
shipped
with
this
banks
person
code
on
it
is
a
separate
act
of
infringement
we
shipped
a
million
of
them
what
the
potential
liability
per
unit
courts
usually
award
guignol
knocked
quietly
on
the
table
what
the
what
the
size
of
the
bill
a
court
hand
down
if
a
jury
was
involved
if
say
this
became
part
of
litigation
portfolio
hackelberg
looked
away
it
up
to
five
hundred
thousand
per
separate
act
of
infringement
guignol
nodded
so
we
looking
at
a
ceiling
on
the
liability
at
billion
then
technically
yes
but
i
propose
that
we
offer
a
settlement
with
this
banks
person
we
drop
our
suit
if
he
indemnifies
us
from
damages
for
his
seconded
said
someone
at
the
table
things
were
picking
up
steam
sammy
bit
the
inside
of
his
cheek
to
keep
his
smile
in
check
wait
hackelberg
said
gentlemen
and
lady
please
while
it
true
that
damages
can
technically
run
to
per
infringement
that
simply
is
done
not
to
entities
like
this
firm
listen
we
that
law
so
we
could
sue
people
who
took
from
it
wo
be
used
against
us
we
will
face
at
worst
a
few
hundred
dollars
per
act
of
infringement
still
a
sizable
sum
of
money
but
in
the
final
analysis
thank
you
guignol
said
all
in
favor
of
offering
a
settlement
it
was
unanimous
except
for
hackelberg
sammy
got
his
rematch
with
hackelberg
when
the
quarterly
financials
came
out
it
was
all
that
black
ink
making
him
giddy
i
do
want
to
be
disrespectful
he
said
knowing
that
in
hackelberg
books
there
could
be
nothing
more
disrespectful
than
challenging
him
but
we
need
to
confront
some
business
realities
here
hackelberg
office
was
nothing
like
sammy
had
expected
not
a
southern
gentleman
study
lined
with
hunting
trophies
and
framed
ancestral
photos
it
was
as
spare
as
the
office
of
a
temp
almost
empty
save
for
a
highly
functional
desk
bookcases
lined
with
and
a
chair
it
was
ascetic
severe
and
it
was
more
intimidating
than
any
den
could
hope
to
be
hackelberg
heavy
eyelids
drooped
a
little
the
corners
of
his
eyes
going
down
with
them
it
was
like
staring
down
a
gator
sammy
resisted
the
urge
to
look
away
the
numbers
do
lie
diab
is
making
us
a
fortune
and
most
of
coming
from
the
platform
not
the
goop
and
not
the
increased
visitor
numbers
we
making
money
because
other
people
are
figuring
out
ways
to
use
our
stuff
it
our
revenue
source
and
if
it
continues
we
going
to
end
up
being
a
diab
company
with
a
in
that
the
good
news
the
bad
news
is
that
these
characters
in
the
ghost
mall
have
us
in
their
crosshairs
they
prying
us
open
faster
than
we
can
lock
ourselves
down
but
here
another
way
of
looking
at
it
every
time
they
add
another
feature
to
the
diab
they
make
owning
a
diab
more
attractive
which
makes
it
easier
for
us
to
sell
access
to
the
platform
to
advertisers
hackelberg
held
up
his
hands
samuel
i
think
i
heard
enough
your
job
is
to
figure
out
new
businesses
for
us
to
diversify
into
my
job
is
to
contain
our
liability
and
protect
our
brand
and
investors
it
sounds
a
lot
to
me
like
you
saying
that
you
want
me
to
leave
off
doing
my
job
so
that
you
can
do
yours
sammy
squirmed
no
that
not
it
at
all
we
both
want
to
protect
the
business
i
not
saying
that
you
need
to
give
these
guys
a
free
ride
what
i
saying
is
suing
these
guys
is
good
for
our
business
it
costs
us
money
goodwill
it
distracts
us
from
doing
our
jobs
hackelberg
leaned
back
and
looked
coolly
into
sammy
eyes
what
are
you
proposing
as
an
alternative
then
the
idea
had
come
to
sammy
in
the
shower
one
morning
as
he
mentally
calculated
the
size
of
his
coming
quarterly
bonus
a
great
idea
out
of
the
box
thinking
the
right
answer
to
the
question
that
no
one
had
thought
to
ask
it
had
seemed
so
then
now
though
i
think
we
should
buy
them
out
hackelberg
thin
mirthless
grin
made
his
balls
shrivel
up
sammy
held
up
his
hands
here
look
at
this
i
drew
up
some
figures
what
they
earning
what
we
earn
from
them
growth
estimates
over
the
next
five
quarters
it
not
just
some
random
idea
i
had
in
the
shower
this
makes
he
passed
over
a
sheaf
of
papers
replete
with
hackelberg
set
it
down
in
the
center
of
his
desk
perfectly
square
to
the
corners
he
flipped
through
the
first
five
pages
then
squared
the
stack
up
again
you
done
a
lot
of
work
here
samuel
i
can
really
see
that
he
got
up
from
his
chair
lifted
sammy
papers
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
and
crossed
to
the
wall
there
was
a
shredder
there
its
maw
a
wide
rectangle
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
can
stick
entire
hardcover
books
or
hard
drives
into
calmly
hackelberg
fed
sammy
paper
into
the
shredder
fastidiously
holding
the
corner
between
thumb
and
forefinger
then
dropping
the
corner
in
once
the
rest
had
been
digested
i
wo
ask
you
for
your
computer
he
said
settling
back
into
his
chair
but
i
expect
that
you
will
back
up
your
other
data
and
then
send
the
to
it
to
be
permanently
erased
i
do
want
any
record
of
this
period
i
want
this
done
by
the
end
of
business
today
sammy
mouth
hung
open
he
shut
it
then
he
opened
it
again
abruptly
hackelberg
stood
knocking
his
chair
to
the
ground
behind
him
not
one
word
do
you
understand
me
not
one
solitary
word
you
goddamned
idiot
we
in
the
middle
of
being
sued
by
these
people
i
you
know
this
since
it
your
fault
that
it
happening
i
know
that
you
know
that
the
stakes
are
the
company
now
say
a
jury
were
to
discover
that
we
were
considering
buying
these
assholes
out
say
a
jury
were
to
decide
that
our
litigation
was
a
base
stratagem
to
lower
the
asking
price
for
their
their
the
word
dripped
with
sarcasm
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen
if
you
had
the
sense
of
a
five
year
old
you
have
known
better
than
to
do
this
good
christ
page
i
should
have
security
escort
you
to
the
gate
turn
on
your
heel
and
go
weep
in
the
corridor
do
stand
in
my
office
for
one
more
second
get
your
computer
to
it
by
i
will
check
that
goes
for
anyone
you
worked
with
on
this
anyone
who
has
a
copy
of
this
information
now
leave
sammy
stood
rooted
in
place
leave
you
ridiculous
little
get
out
of
my
sight
sammy
drew
in
a
deep
breath
he
thought
about
saying
something
like
ca
talk
to
me
like
but
it
was
very
likely
that
hackelberg
could
talk
to
him
just
like
that
he
felt
and
a
little
sick
and
he
backed
slowly
out
of
the
office
standing
in
the
corridor
he
began
to
shake
he
pounded
the
elevator
button
and
felt
the
eyes
of
hackelberg
severe
secretary
burning
into
his
back
abruptly
he
turned
away
and
yanked
open
the
staircase
door
so
hard
it
smashed
into
the
wall
with
a
loud
bang
he
took
the
stairs
in
a
rush
of
desperate
claustrophobia
wanting
more
than
anything
to
get
outside
to
breathe
in
the
fresh
air
he
stumbled
on
the
way
down
falling
a
couple
of
steps
and
smashing
into
the
wall
on
the
landing
he
stood
pressed
against
the
wall
the
cold
cinder
block
on
his
cheek
which
felt
like
it
might
be
bruised
the
pain
was
enough
to
bring
him
back
to
his
senses
this
is
ridiculous
he
had
the
right
answer
hackelberg
was
wrong
hackelberg
did
run
the
company
yes
it
was
hard
to
get
anything
done
without
his
but
it
was
impossible
going
behind
hackelberg
back
to
the
executive
committee
could
cost
him
his
job
of
course
of
course
sammy
realized
that
he
did
actually
if
he
lost
his
job
oh
the
thought
made
his
chest
constrict
and
thoughts
of
living
in
a
refrigerator
box
materialize
in
his
mind
eye
but
beyond
that
he
really
did
care
it
was
such
a
goddamned
ride
sammy
smiled
grimly
at
the
metaphor
you
guess
right
you
end
up
on
top
you
guess
wrong
you
bottom
out
he
spent
half
his
career
lording
it
over
the
poor
guessers
and
the
other
half
panicking
about
a
bad
guess
he
made
he
thought
of
perry
and
lester
thought
of
that
night
in
boston
he
killed
their
ride
and
the
party
had
gone
on
all
the
same
they
had
something
in
that
crazy
shantytown
something
pure
and
happy
some
camaraderie
that
he
always
assumed
he
get
someday
but
that
had
never
materialized
if
this
was
his
dream
job
how
much
worse
would
unemployment
really
be
he
would
go
to
the
executive
committee
he
would
not
erase
his
numbers
he
set
off
for
his
office
moving
quickly
purposefully
head
up
a
last
stand
how
exciting
why
not
he
piloted
the
little
down
the
back
road
and
was
nearly
at
his
building
door
when
he
spotted
the
security
detail
three
of
them
in
lightweight
disney
cop
uniforms
wearing
ranger
hats
and
looking
around
alertly
hackelberg
must
have
sent
them
there
to
make
sure
that
he
followed
through
with
deleting
his
data
he
stopped
the
golf
cart
abruptly
and
reversed
out
of
the
driveway
before
the
guards
spotted
him
he
needed
to
get
his
files
somewhere
that
hackelberg
would
be
able
to
retrieve
them
he
zipped
down
the
service
roads
thinking
furiously
the
answer
occurred
to
him
in
the
form
of
a
for
the
polynesian
hotel
he
turned
up
its
drive
and
parked
the
as
he
stepped
out
he
removed
his
employee
badge
and
untucked
his
shirt
now
he
was
just
another
sweaty
tourist
dad
coming
in
to
rendezvous
with
mom
and
the
kids
back
from
some
banal
meeting
that
delayed
his
arrival
has
even
had
time
to
change
into
a
he
headed
straight
for
the
sundries
store
and
bought
a
walt
disney
world
postcard
with
a
little
magnetic
patch
mounted
on
one
corner
you
filled
up
the
memory
with
a
couple
hours
worth
of
video
and
as
many
photos
as
you
wanted
and
mailed
it
off
the
pixelated
display
on
the
front
played
a
slide
show
of
the
images
at
least
once
a
year
some
honeymoon
couple
would
miss
this
fact
and
throw
a
couple
racy
bedroom
shots
in
the
mix
to
the
perennial
delight
of
the
mail
room
he
hastily
wrote
some
banalities
about
the
great
time
he
and
the
kids
were
having
in
disney
world
then
he
opened
his
computer
and
looked
up
the
address
that
the
church
woman
had
checked
in
under
he
addressed
it
simply
to
suzanne
to
further
throw
off
the
scent
then
he
slipped
it
into
a
with
a
prayer
to
the
gods
of
journalist
shield
laws
he
walked
as
calmly
as
he
could
back
to
his
clipping
on
his
employee
badge
and
tucking
his
shirt
back
in
then
he
motored
calmly
to
his
office
building
the
disney
cops
were
sweating
under
the
sun
mr
page
yes
he
said
i
to
take
your
computer
to
it
sir
i
do
think
so
sammy
said
with
perfect
calm
i
think
we
go
up
to
my
office
and
call
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
instead
the
security
guard
was
young
latino
and
skinny
his
short
left
his
scalp
exposed
to
the
sun
he
took
his
hat
off
and
mopped
his
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
exposing
a
line
of
acne
where
his
irritated
the
skin
it
made
sammy
feel
sorry
for
the
kid
especially
considering
that
sammy
earned
more
than
times
the
kid
salary
this
really
is
your
job
i
know
sammy
said
wondering
where
all
this
sympathy
for
the
laboring
classes
had
come
from
anyway
i
want
to
make
it
hard
for
you
we
go
inside
you
can
hang
on
to
the
computer
we
talk
to
some
people
if
they
tell
you
to
go
ahead
you
go
ahead
otherwise
we
go
see
them
all
right
he
held
his
computer
out
to
the
kid
who
took
it
let
go
up
to
my
office
now
he
said
the
kid
shook
his
head
i
supposed
to
take
this
i
know
i
know
but
we
have
a
deal
the
kid
looked
like
he
would
head
out
anyway
and
there
are
backups
in
my
office
so
you
need
to
come
and
get
those
too
that
did
it
the
kid
looked
a
little
grateful
as
they
went
inside
where
the
air
conditioning
was
blowing
icy
cold
you
should
have
waited
in
the
lobby
luis
sammy
said
reading
the
kid
name
off
his
badge
you
must
be
boiled
i
had
instructions
luis
said
sammy
made
a
face
they
do
sound
like
very
reasonable
instructions
all
the
more
reason
to
sort
this
out
right
sammy
had
his
secretary
get
luis
a
bottle
of
cold
water
and
a
little
plate
of
grapes
and
berries
out
of
the
stash
he
kept
for
his
visitors
then
he
called
guignol
from
his
desk
phone
it
sammy
i
need
to
call
an
emergency
meeting
of
the
exec
committee
he
said
without
preamble
this
is
about
hackelberg
is
it
he
already
called
you
he
was
very
persuasive
i
can
be
persuasive
too
give
me
a
chance
you
know
what
will
happen
if
you
push
this
i
might
save
the
company
you
might
guignol
said
and
you
might
i
know
sammy
said
what
the
hell
it
only
a
career
you
ca
keep
your
data
hackelberg
is
right
about
that
i
can
send
all
the
backups
and
my
computer
to
your
office
right
now
i
was
under
the
impression
that
they
were
all
on
their
way
to
it
for
disposal
not
yet
there
a
security
castmember
in
my
office
with
me
named
luis
if
you
want
to
call
dispatch
and
have
them
direct
him
to
bring
this
stuff
to
you
instead
sammy
do
you
understand
what
you
doing
here
sammy
suppressed
a
mad
giggle
i
do
he
said
i
understand
exactly
what
i
doing
i
want
to
help
you
all
understand
that
too
i
calling
security
dispatch
now
a
moment
later
luis
phone
rang
and
the
kid
listened
intently
nodding
unconsciously
once
he
hung
up
sammy
passed
him
his
backups
hardcopy
and
computer
let
go
he
said
right
luis
said
and
led
the
way
it
was
a
short
ride
to
the
casting
office
building
where
guignol
had
his
office
the
wind
felt
terrific
on
his
face
drying
his
sweat
it
had
been
a
long
day
when
they
pulled
up
sammy
let
luis
lead
the
way
again
badging
in
behind
him
following
him
up
to
the
at
the
end
of
the
gold
coast
where
the
most
senior
offices
were
guignol
met
them
at
the
door
and
took
the
materials
from
luis
then
ushered
sammy
in
sammy
caught
luis
eye
and
luis
surprised
him
by
winking
and
slipping
him
a
surreptitious
making
sammy
feel
like
they
shared
a
secret
there
were
eight
on
the
executive
committee
but
they
travelled
a
lot
sammy
had
expected
to
see
no
more
than
four
there
were
two
and
hackelberg
of
course
the
lawyer
was
the
picture
of
saurian
calm
sammy
sat
down
at
the
table
and
helped
himself
to
a
glass
of
water
watching
a
ring
pool
on
the
table
polished
and
waxed
wooden
surface
samuel
hackelberg
said
shaking
his
head
i
hoped
it
would
come
to
this
sammy
took
a
deep
breath
looking
for
that
calm
that
had
suffused
him
before
it
was
there
still
not
as
potent
but
there
he
drew
upon
it
let
put
this
to
the
committee
shall
we
i
mean
we
already
know
how
we
feel
that
wo
be
necessary
hackelberg
said
the
committee
has
already
voted
on
this
sammy
closed
his
eyes
and
rubbed
the
bridge
of
his
nose
he
looked
at
hackelberg
who
was
smiling
grimly
a
mean
grin
that
went
all
the
way
to
the
corners
of
his
eyes
sammy
looked
around
at
guignol
and
the
committee
members
they
would
meet
his
eye
guignol
gestured
luis
into
the
room
and
handed
him
sammy
computer
papers
and
backups
he
leaned
in
and
spoke
quietly
to
him
luis
turned
and
left
guignol
cleared
his
throat
there
nothing
else
to
discuss
then
he
said
thank
you
all
for
coming
in
his
heart
sammy
had
known
this
was
coming
hackelberg
would
beat
him
to
the
committee
never
let
him
present
his
side
watching
the
lawyer
get
up
stiffly
and
leave
with
slow
dignified
steps
sammy
had
a
moment
intuition
about
what
it
must
be
like
to
be
that
man
possessed
of
a
kind
of
cold
furious
power
that
came
from
telling
everyone
that
not
obeying
you
to
the
letter
would
put
them
in
terrible
danger
he
knew
that
line
of
reasoning
it
was
the
same
one
he
got
from
the
tsa
at
the
airport
before
they
bent
him
over
and
greased
him
up
ca
understand
the
grave
danger
we
all
face
you
must
obey
me
for
only
i
can
keep
it
at
bay
he
waited
for
the
rest
of
the
committee
to
file
out
none
of
them
would
meet
his
eye
then
it
was
just
him
and
guignol
sammy
raised
his
eyebrows
and
spread
out
his
hands
miming
happens
now
you
wo
be
able
to
get
anything
productive
done
until
it
gets
through
with
your
computer
take
some
time
off
call
up
dinah
and
see
if
she
wants
to
grab
some
holiday
time
we
split
sammy
said
he
drank
his
water
and
stood
up
i
just
got
one
question
before
i
go
guignol
winced
but
stood
his
ground
go
ahead
he
said
do
you
want
to
know
what
the
numbers
looked
like
it
not
my
job
to
overrule
legal
we
get
to
that
in
a
second
it
not
the
question
the
question
is
do
you
to
guignol
sighed
you
know
i
want
to
know
of
course
i
want
to
know
this
is
about
me
and
what
i
want
though
it
about
making
sure
we
do
endanger
the
shareholders
so
ignoring
this
path
sticking
our
heads
in
the
sand
that
for
the
shareholders
no
of
course
it
not
good
for
the
shareholders
but
it
better
than
endangering
the
whole
company
sammy
nodded
well
how
about
if
we
both
take
some
time
off
and
drive
down
to
hollywood
it
do
us
some
good
sammy
i
got
a
job
to
do
yeah
but
without
your
computer
guignol
looked
at
him
what
did
you
do
it
not
what
i
did
it
what
i
might
have
done
i
going
to
be
a
good
boy
and
give
hackelberg
a
list
of
everyone
i
might
have
emailed
about
this
all
those
people
are
losing
their
computers
to
the
big
magnet
at
it
but
you
never
emailed
me
about
this
you
sure
i
might
have
it
the
kind
of
thing
i
might
have
done
maybe
your
ate
it
you
never
know
that
what
for
guignol
looked
angry
for
a
moment
then
laughed
you
are
such
a
shithead
fuck
that
lawyer
asshole
anyway
what
are
you
driving
these
days
just
bought
a
new
dell
luminux
sammy
said
grinning
back
when
do
we
leave
i
pick
you
up
at
tomorrow
beat
the
morning
traffic
suzanne
was
getting
sick
of
breakfast
in
bed
it
was
hard
to
imagine
that
such
a
thing
was
possible
but
there
it
was
lester
stole
out
from
between
the
covers
before
every
day
and
then
half
an
hour
later
he
was
back
with
a
laden
tray
something
new
every
day
had
steaks
burritos
waffles
granola
with
greek
yogurt
and
today
there
were
eggs
benedict
with
grapefruit
juice
the
tray
always
came
with
a
french
press
of
kona
coffee
a
cloth
napkin
and
her
computer
so
she
could
read
the
news
in
theory
this
was
a
warm
ritual
that
ensured
that
they
had
quality
time
together
every
day
no
matter
what
in
practice
lester
was
so
anxious
about
the
food
and
whether
she
was
enjoying
it
that
she
could
really
enjoy
it
plus
she
was
a
fatkins
so
three
thousand
calorie
breakfasts
were
good
for
her
most
of
all
it
was
the
pressure
to
be
a
happy
couple
to
have
cemented
over
the
old
hurts
and
started
anew
she
felt
it
every
moment
when
lester
climbed
into
the
shower
with
her
and
soaped
her
back
when
he
brought
home
flowers
and
when
he
climbed
into
bed
with
her
in
the
morning
to
eat
breakfast
with
her
she
picked
at
her
caviar
and
blini
glumly
and
poked
at
her
computer
beside
her
lester
hoovered
up
three
thousand
worth
of
fried
dough
and
clattered
on
his
machine
this
is
delicious
babe
thanks
she
said
with
as
much
sincerity
as
she
could
muster
it
was
really
generous
and
nice
of
him
to
do
this
she
was
just
a
bitter
old
woman
who
could
be
happy
no
matter
what
was
going
on
in
her
life
there
was
voicemail
on
her
computer
which
was
unusual
most
people
sent
her
email
this
originated
from
a
pay
phone
on
the
florida
turnpike
ms
church
this
is
ah
this
is
a
person
whom
you
recently
had
the
acquaintance
of
while
on
your
holidays
i
have
a
confidential
matter
to
discuss
with
you
i
travelling
to
your
location
with
a
colleague
today
and
should
arrive
i
hope
you
can
make
some
time
to
meet
with
me
she
listened
to
it
twice
lester
leaned
over
what
that
all
about
you
not
going
to
believe
it
i
think
it
that
disney
guy
the
guy
i
told
you
about
the
one
death
used
to
work
for
he
coming
apparently
woah
do
tell
perry
you
think
he
tear
that
guy
throat
out
with
his
teeth
lester
took
a
bite
of
blini
i
might
help
suzanne
thought
about
sammy
he
had
been
the
sort
of
person
she
could
be
friends
with
but
she
known
plenty
of
his
kind
in
her
day
and
he
was
hardly
the
worst
of
the
lot
he
barely
rated
above
average
on
the
corporate
psychopath
meter
somewhere
in
there
there
was
a
real
personality
she
seen
it
well
then
i
guess
i
better
meet
with
him
alone
it
sounds
like
he
wants
a
meeting
anyway
or
you
think
he
leak
you
something
that
a
pretty
good
working
theory
when
it
comes
to
this
kind
of
call
lester
ate
thoughtfully
then
reached
over
and
hit
a
key
on
her
computer
replaying
the
call
he
sounds
what
giddy
that
right
he
does
does
he
maybe
it
good
news
lester
laughed
and
took
away
her
dishes
and
when
he
came
back
in
he
was
naked
stripped
and
ready
for
the
shower
he
was
a
very
handsome
man
and
he
had
a
devilish
grin
as
he
whisked
the
blanket
off
of
her
he
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
stared
at
her
his
grin
quirking
in
a
way
she
recognized
instantly
she
did
have
to
look
down
to
know
that
he
was
getting
hard
in
the
mirror
of
his
eyes
she
was
beautiful
she
could
see
it
plainly
when
she
looked
into
the
real
mirror
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
draped
with
gauzy
and
crusted
around
the
edges
with
kitschy
tourist
magnets
lester
brought
home
she
saw
a
saggy
woman
with
cellulite
and
lester
had
slept
with
more
fatkins
girls
than
she
could
count
women
made
into
mannequins
by
surgery
and
chemical
enhancements
women
who
read
sex
manuals
in
public
places
and
boasted
about
their
kegel
scores
but
when
he
looked
at
her
like
that
she
knew
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
ever
loved
that
he
would
do
anything
for
her
that
he
loved
her
as
much
as
he
could
ever
love
anyone
the
hell
was
i
complaining
about
she
thought
as
he
fell
on
her
like
a
starving
man
she
met
sammy
in
their
favorite
the
one
perched
up
on
a
crow
nest
four
storeys
up
a
corkscrew
building
whose
supplies
came
up
on
a
series
of
dumbwaiters
and
winches
that
shrouded
its
balconies
like
vines
she
staked
out
the
best
table
the
one
with
the
panoramic
view
of
the
whole
shantytown
and
ordered
a
plate
of
the
tiny
shortbread
cakes
that
were
the
house
specialty
along
with
a
gigantic
mug
of
nonfat
decaf
cappuccino
sammy
came
up
the
steps
and
sweaty
wearing
a
shirt
and
bermuda
shorts
like
some
kind
of
tourist
or
like
he
was
on
holidays
behind
him
came
a
younger
man
with
severe
little
designer
glasses
dressed
in
the
conventional
and
slacks
uniform
of
the
corporate
exec
on
a
day
suzanne
sprinkled
an
ironic
wave
at
them
and
gestured
to
the
mismatched
chairs
at
her
table
the
waitress
shayna
came
over
with
two
glasses
of
water
and
a
paper
napkin
dispenser
the
men
thanked
her
and
mopped
their
faces
and
drank
their
water
good
drive
sammy
nodded
his
friend
looked
nervous
like
he
was
wondering
what
might
have
been
swimming
in
his
water
glass
this
is
some
place
we
like
it
here
is
there
you
know
a
bathroom
the
companion
asked
through
there
suzanne
pointed
how
do
you
deal
with
the
sewage
around
here
sewage
mr
page
sewage
is
we
feed
it
into
our
generators
and
the
waste
heat
runs
our
condenser
purifiers
there
was
talk
of
building
one
big
one
for
the
whole
town
but
that
required
way
too
much
coordination
and
anyway
perry
was
convinced
that
having
central
points
of
failure
would
be
begging
for
a
disaster
i
wrote
a
series
on
it
if
you
like
i
can
send
you
the
links
the
disney
exec
made
some
noises
and
ate
some
shortbread
peered
at
the
menu
and
ordered
some
thai
iced
tea
look
ms
church
suzanne
thank
you
for
seeing
me
i
would
have
understood
completely
if
you
told
me
to
go
fuck
myself
suzanne
smiled
and
made
a
gesture
before
my
friend
comes
back
from
the
bathroom
before
we
meet
up
with
anyone
from
your
side
i
just
want
you
to
know
this
what
you
done
it
changed
the
world
i
would
be
here
today
if
it
was
for
you
he
had
every
appearance
of
being
completely
sincere
he
was
a
little
and
windblown
today
not
like
she
remembered
him
from
orlando
what
the
hell
had
happened
to
him
what
was
he
here
for
his
friend
came
back
and
sammy
said
i
ordered
you
a
thai
iced
tea
this
is
suzanne
church
the
writer
ms
church
this
is
herve
guignol
of
the
florida
regional
division
of
disney
parks
guignol
was
more
and
than
sammy
he
shook
her
hand
and
made
executive
sounding
grunts
at
her
he
was
young
and
clearly
into
playing
the
role
of
exec
he
reminded
suzanne
of
fresh
silicon
valley
millionaires
who
could
go
from
hackers
to
who
bullshitted
knowledgeably
about
ebitda
overnight
the
hell
are
you
two
here
for
mr
page
sammy
call
me
sammy
please
did
you
get
my
postcard
that
was
from
you
she
not
been
able
to
make
heads
or
tails
of
it
when
it
arrived
in
the
mail
the
day
before
and
she
chucked
it
out
as
part
of
some
viral
marketing
campaign
she
did
want
to
get
infected
by
you
got
it
i
threw
it
out
sammy
went
slightly
green
but
it
still
be
in
the
trash
she
said
lester
never
takes
it
out
and
i
have
um
can
we
go
and
get
it
now
all
the
same
what
on
it
sammy
and
guignol
exchanged
a
long
look
let
pretend
that
i
gave
you
a
long
to
this
let
pretend
that
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
impressing
on
you
that
this
is
confidential
and
not
for
publication
let
pretend
that
i
charmed
you
and
made
sure
you
understood
how
much
respect
i
have
for
you
and
your
friends
here
i
get
it
suzanne
said
trying
not
to
laugh
for
really
ok
let
pretend
all
that
now
i
tell
you
what
on
that
postcard
is
the
financials
for
a
disney
parks
buyout
of
your
entire
operation
here
diabolical
the
ride
all
of
it
suzanne
had
been
expecting
a
lot
of
things
but
this
was
one
of
them
it
was
loopy
daffy
not
just
weird
but
inconceivable
as
though
he
said
i
sent
you
our
plans
to
carve
your
portrait
on
the
moon
surface
with
a
green
laser
but
she
was
a
pro
she
kept
her
face
still
and
neutral
and
calmly
swallowed
her
cappuccino
i
see
and
there
are
there
are
people
at
disney
who
feel
like
this
idea
is
so
dangerous
that
it
does
even
warrant
discussion
that
it
should
be
suppressed
guignol
cleared
his
throat
that
the
consensus
he
said
and
normally
i
say
hey
sure
the
consensus
that
great
but
i
tell
you
i
drew
up
these
numbers
because
i
was
curious
i
a
curious
guy
i
like
to
think
laterally
try
stuff
that
might
seem
silly
at
first
see
where
it
goes
i
had
pretty
good
instincts
guignol
and
suzanne
snorted
at
the
same
time
and
an
imperfect
record
sammy
said
suzanne
did
want
to
like
him
but
there
was
something
forthright
about
him
that
she
help
warming
to
there
was
no
subtlety
or
scheming
in
this
guy
whatever
he
wanted
you
could
see
it
right
on
his
face
maybe
he
was
a
psycho
but
he
was
a
sneak
so
i
ran
these
numbers
for
my
own
amusement
to
see
what
they
would
look
like
assume
that
your
boys
want
say
times
gross
annual
revenue
for
a
buyout
say
that
this
settles
our
lawsuit
not
theirs
just
ours
so
we
do
have
to
pay
for
the
trademark
suit
to
go
forward
assume
that
they
generate
one
idea
every
six
months
suzanne
found
herself
nodding
along
especially
at
this
last
one
well
you
make
those
assumptions
and
you
know
what
comes
out
of
it
suzanne
let
the
numbers
dance
behind
her
own
eyelids
she
followed
all
the
relevant
financials
closely
for
years
so
closely
that
they
were
as
familiar
as
her
monthly
and
mortgage
payments
had
been
back
when
she
had
a
straight
job
and
a
straight
life
well
you
make
lester
and
perry
wealthy
she
said
after
they
vested
out
they
be
able
to
live
off
the
interest
alone
sammy
nodded
judiciously
his
sidekick
looked
alarmed
yup
and
for
us
well
assuming
your
last
quarterly
statement
was
accurate
we
were
a
little
conservative
sammy
said
the
other
man
nodded
reflexively
were
very
conservative
she
thought
making
you
a
fortune
and
you
did
want
to
advertise
that
to
the
competition
assuming
that
well
you
guys
earn
back
your
investment
in
what
months
i
figure
a
year
but
months
would
be
good
if
you
vest
the
guys
out
over
three
years
that
means
percent
roi
plus
or
minus
percent
sammy
said
for
less
money
than
we
end
up
spending
on
our
end
of
the
lawsuit
guignol
was
goggling
at
them
both
sammy
drank
his
thai
slurping
noisily
he
signalled
for
another
one
and
you
sent
me
these
financials
on
a
postcard
there
was
some
question
about
whether
they
be
erased
before
i
could
show
them
to
anyone
and
i
knew
there
was
no
way
i
be
given
the
chance
to
them
independently
it
seemed
prudent
to
have
a
backup
copy
a
backup
copy
in
my
hands
well
at
least
i
knew
you
would
give
it
up
without
a
fight
sammy
shrugged
and
offered
her
a
sunny
smile
we
better
go
rescue
that
postcard
from
the
basket
before
lester
develops
a
domestic
instinct
and
takes
out
the
trash
then
suzanne
said
pushing
away
from
the
table
shayna
brought
the
bill
and
sammy
paid
it
overtipping
by
a
factor
of
ten
which
endeared
him
further
to
suzanne
she
could
abide
rich
people
who
stiffed
on
the
tip
suzanne
walked
them
through
the
shantytown
watching
their
reactions
closely
she
liked
to
take
new
people
here
she
witnessed
its
birth
and
growth
then
gone
away
during
its
adolescence
and
now
she
got
to
enjoy
its
maturity
crowds
of
kids
ran
screeching
and
playing
through
the
streets
adults
nodded
at
them
from
their
windows
wires
and
plumbing
and
antennas
crowded
the
skies
above
them
the
walls
shimmered
with
murals
and
graffiti
and
mosaics
sammy
treated
it
like
he
had
his
theme
park
seeming
to
take
in
every
detail
with
a
connoisseur
eye
guignol
was
more
nervous
clearly
feeling
unsafe
amid
the
cheerful
lawlessness
they
came
upon
francis
and
a
gang
of
his
kids
building
bicycles
out
of
stiffened
fabric
and
strong
monofilament
recycled
from
packing
crates
ms
church
francis
said
gravely
he
given
up
drinking
maybe
for
good
and
he
was
and
charming
in
his
coveralls
the
kids
boys
girls
suzanne
noted
approvingly
continued
to
work
over
the
bikes
but
they
were
clearly
watching
what
francis
was
up
to
francis
please
meet
sammy
and
his
colleague
herve
they
here
for
a
story
i
working
on
gentlemen
francis
is
the
closest
thing
we
have
to
a
mayor
around
here
francis
shook
hands
all
around
but
sammy
attention
was
riveted
on
the
bicycles
francis
picked
one
up
with
two
fingers
and
handed
it
to
him
like
it
we
got
the
design
from
a
shop
in
liberia
but
we
made
our
own
local
improvements
the
trick
is
getting
the
stiffener
to
stay
liquid
long
enough
to
get
the
fabric
stretched
out
in
the
right
proportion
sammy
took
the
frame
from
him
and
spun
it
in
one
hand
like
a
baton
and
the
wheels
mostly
we
do
solids
which
stay
in
true
longer
we
use
the
carbon
stiffener
on
a
round
of
canvas
or
denim
then
fit
a
standard
tire
they
go
out
of
true
after
a
while
you
just
apply
some
solvent
to
them
and
they
go
soft
again
and
you
them
with
a
compass
and
a
pair
of
tailor
shears
then
them
you
get
maybe
five
years
of
hard
riding
out
of
a
wheel
that
way
sammy
eyes
were
round
as
saucers
he
took
one
of
the
proffered
wheels
and
spun
it
between
opposing
fingertips
then
grinning
he
picked
up
another
wheel
and
the
and
began
to
them
francis
looked
amused
rather
than
pissed
giving
up
drink
had
softened
his
temper
his
kids
stopped
working
and
laughed
sammy
laughed
too
he
transferred
the
wheels
to
his
left
hand
then
tossed
the
frame
high
the
air
spun
around
and
caught
it
and
then
handed
it
all
back
to
francis
the
kids
clapped
and
he
took
a
bow
i
did
know
you
had
it
in
you
guignol
said
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
sammy
sweating
and
grinning
like
a
fool
said
yeah
it
not
something
i
get
a
lot
of
chances
to
do
around
the
office
but
did
you
see
that
it
was
light
enough
to
juggle
i
mean
how
exciting
is
all
this
he
swept
his
arm
around
his
head
between
the
sewage
and
the
manufacturing
and
all
these
kids
he
broke
off
what
do
you
do
about
education
suzanne
lots
of
kids
bus
into
the
local
schools
or
ride
but
lots
more
these
days
we
do
get
a
very
high
caliber
of
public
school
around
here
might
that
have
something
to
do
with
all
the
residents
who
do
pay
property
tax
guignol
said
pointedly
suzanne
nodded
i
sure
it
does
she
said
but
it
has
more
to
do
with
the
overall
quality
of
public
education
in
this
state
in
the
nation
for
funding
they
were
at
her
and
lester
place
now
she
led
them
through
the
front
door
and
picked
up
the
next
to
the
little
table
where
she
sorted
the
mail
after
picking
it
up
from
her
po
box
at
a
little
strip
mall
down
the
road
there
was
the
postcard
she
handed
it
silently
to
sammy
who
held
it
for
a
moment
then
reluctantly
passed
it
to
guignol
you
better
hang
on
to
it
he
said
and
she
sensed
that
there
was
something
bigger
going
on
there
now
we
go
see
lester
suzanne
said
he
was
behind
the
building
in
his
little
workshop
hacking
diabolical
there
were
five
different
diabs
running
around
him
chugging
and
humming
the
smell
of
goop
and
fuser
and
heat
filled
the
room
and
an
like
a
labored
to
keep
things
cool
still
it
was
a
few
degrees
warmer
inside
than
out
lester
suzanne
shouted
over
the
din
we
have
visitors
lester
straightened
up
from
his
keyboard
and
wiped
his
palms
and
turned
to
face
them
he
knew
who
they
were
based
on
his
earlier
conversation
with
suzanne
but
he
also
clearly
recognized
sammy
you
he
said
you
work
for
disney
sammy
blushed
and
looked
away
lester
turned
to
suzanne
this
guy
used
to
come
up
what
twice
three
times
a
week
sammy
nodded
and
mumbled
something
lester
reached
out
and
snapped
off
the
ac
filling
the
room
with
eerie
silence
and
stifling
heat
what
was
that
i
a
great
believer
in
competitive
intelligence
you
work
for
disney
they
both
work
for
disney
lester
suzanne
said
this
is
sammy
and
herve
does
do
much
talking
she
mentally
added
he
seems
to
be
in
that
right
sammy
said
seeming
to
come
to
himself
at
last
and
it
an
honor
to
formally
meet
you
at
last
i
run
the
diab
program
i
see
you
a
fan
i
read
quite
a
bit
about
you
of
course
thanks
to
ms
church
here
lester
hands
closed
and
opened
closed
and
opened
you
were
what
you
were
sneaking
around
here
have
i
mentioned
that
i
a
great
fan
of
not
just
the
ride
either
this
diabolical
well
it
what
are
you
doing
here
suzanne
had
expected
something
like
this
lester
was
like
perry
he
would
go
off
the
with
this
guy
but
he
was
going
to
be
his
best
buddy
either
still
someone
needed
to
intervene
before
this
melted
down
altogether
lester
she
said
putting
her
hand
on
his
warm
shoulder
do
you
want
to
show
these
guys
what
you
working
on
he
blew
air
through
his
nose
a
couple
times
then
settled
down
he
even
smiled
this
one
he
said
pointing
to
a
diabolical
i
got
it
running
an
experimental
firmware
that
lets
it
print
out
hollow
components
they
a
lot
lighter
and
they
do
last
as
long
but
they
also
way
less
consumptive
on
goop
you
get
about
ten
times
as
much
printing
out
of
them
suzanne
noted
that
this
bit
of
news
turned
both
of
the
disney
execs
a
little
green
they
made
a
lot
of
money
selling
goop
she
knew
this
one
lester
continued
patting
a
diab
that
was
open
to
the
elements
its
imps
lounging
in
its
guts
we
mix
some
serious
epoxy
in
with
it
some
carbon
fibers
the
printouts
are
practically
indestructible
there
are
some
kids
around
here
who
been
using
it
to
print
parts
for
bicycles
those
were
printed
on
sammy
said
we
ran
into
francis
and
his
gang
suzanne
explained
lester
nodded
yeah
it
not
perfect
though
the
epoxy
clogs
up
the
works
and
the
imps
really
do
like
it
i
only
get
two
or
three
days
out
of
a
printer
after
i
convert
it
i
working
on
changing
the
mix
to
fix
that
though
after
all
guignol
noted
sourly
it
not
as
if
you
have
to
pay
for
new
diabs
when
you
break
one
lester
smiled
nastily
at
him
exactly
he
said
we
got
a
great
research
subsidy
around
here
guignol
looked
away
lips
pursed
this
one
lester
said
choosing
not
to
notice
this
one
is
the
realization
of
an
project
he
pointed
to
the
table
next
to
it
where
its
imps
were
carefully
fitting
together
some
very
fine
parts
sammy
leaned
in
close
inspecting
their
work
after
a
second
he
hissed
like
a
teakettle
then
slapped
his
knee
now
lester
smile
was
more
genuine
he
loved
it
when
people
appreciated
his
work
you
figured
it
out
you
printing
diabs
not
the
whole
thing
lester
said
a
lot
of
the
logic
needs
an
fpga
burner
and
we
ca
do
some
of
the
conductive
elements
either
but
yeah
about
percent
of
the
diab
can
be
printed
in
a
diab
suzanne
had
heard
about
this
one
though
she
remembered
earlier
attempts
back
in
the
golden
new
work
days
the
dream
of
machines
now
she
looked
close
leaning
in
next
to
sammy
so
close
she
could
feel
his
warm
breath
there
was
something
well
about
the
imps
building
a
machine
using
another
one
of
the
machines
it
what
it
like
it
alive
and
reproducing
itself
sammy
said
do
tell
me
this
never
occurred
to
you
lester
said
honestly
no
it
never
did
mr
banks
you
have
a
uniquely
twisted
fucked
up
imagination
and
i
say
that
with
the
warmest
admiration
guignol
leaned
in
too
staring
at
it
it
so
obvious
now
that
i
see
it
he
said
yeah
all
the
really
great
ideas
are
like
that
lester
said
sammy
straightened
up
and
shook
lester
hand
thank
you
for
the
tour
lester
you
have
managed
to
simultaneously
impress
and
depress
me
you
are
one
sharp
motherfucker
lester
preened
and
suzanne
suppressed
a
giggle
sammy
held
his
hand
up
like
he
was
being
sworn
in
i
dead
serious
man
this
is
amazing
i
mean
we
manage
some
pretty
thinking
at
disney
right
we
may
not
be
as
nimble
as
some
little
whacked
out
but
for
who
we
are
i
think
we
do
a
good
job
but
you
man
you
blow
us
out
of
the
water
this
stuff
is
just
like
it
came
down
from
mars
like
it
from
the
future
he
shook
his
head
it
humbling
you
know
guignol
looked
more
thoughtful
than
he
had
to
this
point
he
and
lester
stared
at
sammy
wearing
similar
expressions
of
bemusement
let
go
into
the
apartment
suzanne
said
we
can
sit
down
and
have
a
chat
they
trooped
up
the
stairs
together
guignol
expressed
admiration
for
the
weird
that
adorned
each
landing
made
by
a
local
craftswoman
and
installed
by
the
landlord
they
sat
around
the
living
room
and
lester
poured
iced
coffee
out
of
a
pitcher
in
the
fridge
dropping
in
molded
to
look
like
legos
they
rattled
their
drinks
and
looked
uncomfortably
at
one
another
suzanne
longed
to
whip
out
her
computer
and
take
notes
or
at
least
a
pad
or
a
camera
but
she
restrained
himself
guignol
looked
significantly
at
sammy
lester
i
just
going
to
say
it
would
you
sell
your
business
to
us
the
ride
diabolical
all
of
it
we
could
make
you
a
very
very
rich
man
you
and
perry
you
would
have
the
freedom
to
go
on
doing
what
you
doing
but
we
put
it
in
our
production
chain
the
hell
out
of
it
get
it
into
places
you
never
seen
at
its
peak
new
work
which
you
were
only
a
small
part
of
remember
touched
percent
of
americans
of
americans
have
been
to
a
disney
park
we
a
bigger
tourist
draw
than
of
great
britain
we
can
give
your
ideas
legs
lester
began
to
chuckle
then
laugh
then
he
was
doubled
over
thumping
his
thighs
suzanne
shook
her
head
in
just
a
few
short
moments
she
gotten
used
to
the
idea
and
it
was
growing
on
her
guignol
looked
grim
it
not
a
firm
offer
it
a
chance
to
open
a
dialogue
a
negotiation
talk
the
possibility
over
a
good
negotiation
is
one
where
we
both
start
by
saying
what
we
want
and
work
it
over
until
we
get
to
the
point
where
we
left
with
what
we
both
need
lester
wiped
tears
from
his
eyes
i
do
think
that
you
grasp
the
absurdity
of
this
situation
fellas
for
starters
perry
will
never
go
for
it
i
mean
suzanne
wondered
about
that
and
wondered
whether
it
mattered
the
two
had
hardly
said
a
word
to
each
other
in
months
what
more
the
rest
of
the
rides
will
never
never
go
in
for
it
that
also
for
sure
finally
what
the
fuck
are
you
talking
about
me
go
to
work
for
you
us
go
to
work
for
you
what
will
you
do
stick
mickey
in
the
ride
he
already
in
the
ride
every
now
and
again
as
you
well
know
you
going
to
move
me
up
to
orlando
sammy
waggled
his
head
from
side
to
side
i
have
a
deep
appreciation
for
how
weird
this
is
lester
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
thought
much
about
your
ride
or
this
little
town
as
far
as
concerned
we
could
just
buy
it
and
then
turn
around
and
sell
it
back
to
the
residents
for
one
dollar
we
would
want
to
own
or
operate
any
of
this
stuff
the
liability
is
too
huge
likewise
the
other
rides
we
do
care
about
what
you
did
we
care
about
what
you
going
to
do
tomorrow
listen
you
a
smart
guy
you
make
stuff
that
we
ca
dream
of
that
we
lack
the
institutional
imagination
to
dream
of
we
need
what
the
hell
is
the
point
of
fighting
you
suing
you
when
we
can
put
you
on
the
payroll
and
you
know
what
even
if
we
throw
an
idiotic
sum
of
money
at
you
even
if
you
never
make
anything
for
us
we
still
ahead
of
the
game
if
you
stop
making
stuff
us
i
putting
my
cards
on
the
table
here
i
know
your
partner
is
going
to
be
even
harder
to
convince
too
none
of
this
is
going
to
be
easy
i
do
care
about
easy
i
care
about
what
right
i
sick
of
being
in
charge
of
sabotaging
people
who
make
awesome
stuff
you
sick
of
being
sabotaged
would
you
like
to
come
work
some
place
where
we
shovel
money
and
resources
at
your
projects
and
keep
the
wolves
at
bay
suzanne
was
impressed
this
was
the
same
guy
whom
freddy
had
savaged
it
was
the
same
guy
that
death
waits
had
described
he
had
come
a
long
way
even
guignol
whom
she
suspected
needed
to
be
sold
on
the
idea
almost
as
much
as
lester
was
nodding
along
by
the
end
of
it
lester
was
though
you
wasting
your
time
mister
that
all
there
is
to
it
i
am
not
going
to
go
and
work
for
a
giggle
escaped
his
lips
disney
it
just
sammy
held
his
hands
up
in
partial
surrender
ok
ok
i
wo
push
you
today
think
about
it
talk
it
over
with
your
buddy
i
a
patient
guy
guignol
snorted
i
do
want
to
lean
on
you
here
they
took
their
leave
though
suzanne
found
out
later
that
taken
a
spin
around
the
ride
before
leaving
everyone
went
on
the
ride
lester
shook
his
head
at
the
door
behind
them
can
you
believe
that
suzanne
smiled
and
squeezed
his
hand
you
funny
about
this
you
know
that
normally
when
you
encounter
a
new
idea
you
like
to
play
with
it
think
it
through
see
what
you
can
make
of
it
with
this
you
not
even
willing
to
noodle
with
it
you
ca
seriously
think
that
this
is
a
good
idea
i
do
know
it
not
the
dumbest
idea
i
ever
heard
become
a
millionaire
get
to
do
whatever
you
want
it
sure
make
an
interesting
story
he
goggled
at
her
kidding
she
said
thinking
would
indeed
make
an
interesting
story
though
but
where
are
you
going
from
here
are
you
going
to
stay
here
forever
perry
would
never
go
for
it
lester
said
then
stopped
you
and
perry
lester
how
long
do
you
think
that
going
to
last
do
you
go
all
yoko
on
me
suzanne
we
got
one
of
those
around
here
already
i
do
like
this
yoko
joke
lester
i
never
did
hilda
does
want
to
drive
perry
away
from
you
she
wants
to
make
the
rides
work
and
it
sounds
like
that
what
perry
wants
too
what
wrong
with
them
doing
that
especially
if
you
can
get
them
a
ton
of
money
to
support
it
lester
stared
at
her
honey
think
about
it
lester
your
most
important
virtue
is
your
expansive
imagination
use
it
she
watched
this
sink
in
it
did
sink
in
lester
listened
to
her
which
surprised
her
every
now
and
again
most
relationships
seemed
to
be
negotiations
or
possibly
competitions
with
lester
it
was
a
conversation
she
gave
him
a
hug
that
seemed
to
go
on
forever
sammy
was
glad
he
was
driving
the
mood
guignol
was
in
he
have
wrecked
the
car
that
was
the
plan
sammy
he
said
the
plan
was
to
get
the
data
talk
it
over
the
first
casualty
of
any
battle
is
the
sammy
said
threading
them
through
the
press
of
tourist
busses
and
commuter
cars
i
thought
the
first
casualty
was
the
truth
they
spent
too
long
at
the
ride
then
gotten
stuck
in
the
afternoon
rush
hour
out
of
miami
that
too
look
i
proposing
to
spend
a
tenth
of
the
profits
from
the
diab
on
this
venture
in
any
other
circumstance
i
would
do
it
with
a
the
only
reason
it
a
big
deal
is
that
it
carries
enough
legal
liability
to
destroy
the
company
sammy
did
you
listen
to
hackelberg
the
reason
i
still
work
at
disney
is
that
it
the
kind
of
company
where
the
lawyers
do
set
the
agenda
guignol
drummed
his
hands
on
the
dashboard
sammy
pulled
over
and
gassed
up
at
the
next
pump
was
a
minivan
with
kansas
plates
dad
was
a
dumpy
korean
guy
mom
was
a
dumpy
white
midwesterner
with
a
denim
jacket
and
the
back
seat
was
filled
with
vibrating
children
two
girls
and
a
boy
the
kids
were
screaming
and
fighting
the
girls
trying
to
draw
on
the
boy
face
with
lipstick
and
kiddie
mascara
the
boy
squirming
mightily
and
lashing
out
at
them
with
his
gameboy
dad
and
mom
were
having
their
own
heated
discussion
as
dad
gassed
up
sammy
eavesdropped
enough
to
hear
that
they
were
fighting
over
choice
of
taking
the
toll
roads
instead
of
the
cheaper
slower
alternative
route
the
kids
were
shouting
so
loud
though
you
keep
that
up
and
we
not
going
to
disney
world
it
was
the
magic
sentence
the
litmus
test
for
disney
currency
as
it
rose
and
fell
so
did
the
efficacy
of
the
threat
if
sammy
could
he
take
a
video
of
the
result
every
time
this
was
uttered
the
kids
looked
at
dad
and
shrugged
who
cares
the
eldest
sister
said
and
grabbed
the
boy
again
sammy
turned
to
guignol
and
waggled
his
eyebrows
once
he
was
back
in
the
car
he
said
you
know
it
risky
doing
anything
but
riskiest
of
all
is
doing
nothing
guignol
shook
his
head
and
pulled
out
his
computer
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
looking
at
the
numbers
while
sammy
fought
traffic
finally
he
closed
his
computer
put
his
head
back
and
shut
his
eyes
sammy
drove
on
you
think
this
work
guignol
said
which
part
you
think
if
you
buy
these
guys
out
oh
that
part
sure
yeah
slam
dunk
they
cheap
like
i
say
we
could
make
back
the
whole
nut
just
by
settling
the
lawsuit
the
hard
part
is
going
to
be
convincing
them
to
sell
and
hackelberg
that
your
job
not
mine
guignol
slid
the
seat
back
so
it
was
flat
as
a
bed
wake
me
when
we
hit
orlando
it
took
it
three
days
to
get
sammy
his
computer
back
his
secretary
managed
as
best
as
she
could
but
he
was
able
to
do
much
without
it
when
he
got
it
back
at
last
he
eagerly
downloaded
his
backlog
of
mail
it
beggared
the
imagination
even
after
it
there
were
hundreds
of
new
messages
things
he
had
to
pay
real
attention
to
when
he
was
dealing
with
this
stuff
in
little
spurts
every
few
minutes
all
day
long
it
did
seem
like
much
but
it
sure
piled
up
he
enlisted
his
secretary
to
help
him
with
sorting
and
responding
after
an
hour
she
forwarded
one
back
to
him
with
a
bold
red
flag
it
was
from
freddy
he
got
an
instant
headache
the
feeling
halfway
between
a
migraine
and
the
feeling
after
you
bang
your
head
against
the
corner
of
a
table
sammy
i
disappointed
in
you
i
thought
we
were
friends
why
do
i
have
to
learn
about
your
bizarre
plan
to
buy
out
gibbons
and
banks
from
strangers
i
do
hope
you
give
me
a
comment
on
the
story
he
left
the
financials
with
guignol
who
had
been
discreetly
showing
them
around
to
the
rest
of
the
executive
committee
in
closed
door
meetings
one
of
them
must
have
blabbed
though
or
maybe
it
was
a
leak
at
lester
end
he
tasted
his
lunch
and
bile
as
his
stomach
twisted
it
fair
he
had
a
real
chance
of
making
this
happen
and
it
would
be
a
source
of
genuine
good
for
all
concerned
he
got
halfway
through
calling
guignol
number
then
put
the
phone
down
he
did
know
who
to
call
he
put
himself
in
an
unwinnable
position
as
he
contemplated
the
article
that
freddy
would
probably
write
he
realized
that
he
would
almost
certainly
lose
his
job
over
this
too
maybe
end
up
on
the
wrong
end
of
a
lawsuit
man
that
seemed
to
be
his
natural
state
at
disney
maybe
he
was
in
the
wrong
job
he
groaned
and
thumped
himself
on
the
forehead
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
have
good
ideas
and
make
them
happen
basically
he
wanted
to
be
lester
then
he
knew
who
he
had
to
call
ms
church
we
back
to
that
huh
that
probably
not
a
good
sign
suzanne
then
sammy
you
sound
like
you
about
to
pop
a
testicle
spit
it
out
do
you
think
i
could
get
a
job
with
lester
you
not
joking
are
you
freddy
found
out
about
the
buyout
offer
oh
yeah
so
i
gon
na
be
in
search
of
employment
all
i
ever
wanted
to
do
was
come
up
with
cool
ideas
and
execute
them
shush
now
freddy
found
out
about
this
huh
not
surprising
he
got
a
knack
for
it
it
just
about
his
only
virtue
urgh
however
it
also
his
greatest
failing
i
given
this
a
lot
of
thought
since
my
last
run
in
with
freddy
you
call
him
that
to
his
face
not
yet
but
i
look
forward
to
it
tell
you
what
give
me
an
hour
to
talk
to
some
people
here
and
i
get
back
to
you
an
hour
an
hour
he
keep
you
squirming
for
at
least
that
long
he
loves
to
make
people
squirm
it
good
journalism
shakes
loose
some
new
developments
an
hour
have
you
got
a
choice
an
hour
then
suzanne
did
knock
on
lester
door
lester
would
fall
into
place
once
perry
was
in
she
found
him
working
the
ride
hilda
back
in
the
maintenance
bay
tweaking
some
of
the
robots
his
arm
was
out
of
the
cast
but
it
was
noticeably
thinner
than
his
good
left
arm
weak
and
pale
and
flabby
hello
suzanne
he
was
formal
like
he
always
was
these
days
and
it
saddened
her
but
she
pressed
on
perry
we
need
to
shut
down
for
a
while
it
urgent
suzanne
this
is
a
busy
time
we
just
ca
shut
down
she
thumped
her
hand
on
his
counter
cut
it
out
perry
i
have
never
been
an
alarmist
you
know
that
i
understand
intimately
what
it
means
to
shut
this
place
down
look
i
know
that
things
have
been
so
good
between
us
between
of
us
for
a
long
time
but
i
am
your
dear
friend
and
you
are
mine
no
matter
what
going
on
at
this
second
and
i
telling
you
that
you
need
to
shut
this
down
and
we
need
to
talk
do
it
perry
he
gave
her
a
long
considering
look
please
he
looked
at
the
little
queue
of
four
or
five
people
pretending
not
to
eavesdrop
waiting
their
turn
sorry
folks
you
heard
the
lady
family
emergency
um
here
he
rummaged
under
the
counter
came
up
with
scraps
of
paper
mrs
torrence
tearoom
across
the
street
they
make
the
best
cappuccino
in
the
hood
and
the
pastries
are
all
baked
fresh
on
me
ok
come
on
suzanne
said
time
short
she
accompanied
him
to
the
maintenance
bay
and
they
pulled
the
doors
shut
behind
them
hilda
looked
up
from
her
robot
wiping
her
hands
on
her
shorts
she
was
really
lovely
and
the
look
on
her
face
when
she
saw
perry
was
pure
adoration
suzanne
heart
welled
up
for
the
two
of
them
such
a
perfect
picture
of
young
love
then
hilda
saw
suzanne
and
her
expression
grew
guarded
tense
perry
took
hilda
hand
what
this
about
suzanne
he
said
let
me
give
this
to
you
in
one
shot
ok
they
nodded
she
ran
it
down
for
them
sammy
and
guignol
the
postcard
and
the
funny
circumstances
of
their
visit
the
phone
call
so
here
the
thing
he
wants
to
buy
you
guys
out
he
does
want
the
ride
or
the
town
he
just
wants
i
do
know
the
the
pr
win
he
wants
peace
and
the
real
news
is
over
a
barrel
freddy
forcing
his
hand
if
we
can
make
that
problem
go
away
we
can
ask
for
hilda
jaw
hung
slack
you
have
to
be
kidding
perry
shushed
her
suzanne
why
are
you
here
why
are
you
talking
to
lester
about
this
why
has
lester
talked
to
me
about
this
i
mean
just
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
she
winced
i
did
talk
to
lester
because
i
thought
he
be
easier
to
sell
on
this
than
you
are
this
is
a
golden
opportunity
and
i
thought
that
you
would
be
conflicted
as
hell
about
it
and
i
thought
if
i
talked
to
you
first
we
could
get
past
that
i
do
really
have
a
dog
in
this
fight
except
that
i
want
all
parties
to
end
up
not
hating
each
other
that
where
you
headed
now
you
melting
down
in
slow
motion
how
long
since
you
and
lester
had
a
conversation
together
let
alone
a
real
meal
how
long
since
we
all
sat
around
and
laughed
every
good
thing
comes
to
some
kind
of
end
and
then
the
really
good
things
come
to
a
beginning
again
you
two
the
new
work
lots
of
people
got
blisteringly
rich
off
of
new
work
but
not
you
here
a
chance
for
you
to
get
what
you
deserve
for
a
change
you
solve
this
and
you
solve
it
and
not
just
for
you
but
for
that
death
kid
you
can
get
him
justice
that
the
courts
will
take
fifteen
years
to
deliver
perry
scowled
i
do
care
about
money
yes
that
admirable
i
have
one
other
thing
i
been
saving
it
for
last
waiting
to
see
if
you
come
up
with
it
on
your
own
what
why
is
time
of
the
essence
because
freddy
going
to
out
this
dirtball
and
how
do
we
solve
that
hilda
grinned
oh
this
part
i
like
suzanne
laughed
yeah
what
perry
said
freddy
good
at
intelligence
gathering
but
he
not
so
good
at
distinguishing
truth
from
fiction
in
my
view
this
presents
a
fascinating
opportunity
depending
on
what
we
leak
to
him
and
how
we
can
turn
him
into
a
laughing
stock
a
puddle
of
deliquesced
organ
meat
perry
began
to
laugh
you
saying
that
you
think
that
we
should
do
this
deal
for
yeah
that
the
size
of
it
suzanne
said
i
love
it
he
said
hilda
laughed
too
suzanne
extended
her
hand
to
perry
and
he
shook
it
then
she
shook
with
hilda
let
go
find
lester
by
the
time
the
call
came
sammy
was
ready
to
explode
he
got
in
a
golf
cart
and
headed
to
the
animal
kingdom
lodge
which
backed
onto
the
safari
park
portion
of
the
animal
kingdom
he
snuck
himself
onto
the
roof
of
the
grand
hotel
which
had
a
commanding
view
of
the
artificial
savanna
he
watched
a
family
of
giraffes
graze
using
the
zoom
on
his
phone
to
resolve
the
hypnotic
patterns
of
the
little
calf
it
calmed
him
but
the
sound
of
his
phone
ringing
startled
him
so
much
he
nearly
did
a
off
the
roof
heart
hammering
he
answered
it
is
this
sammy
yes
he
said
landon
kettlewell
the
voice
on
the
other
side
said
sammy
knew
the
name
of
course
but
he
had
been
expecting
a
call
from
him
hello
mr
kettlewell
the
boys
have
asked
me
to
negotiate
this
deal
for
them
it
makes
sense
it
be
hard
to
make
this
happen
without
my
contributions
i
hope
you
agree
it
does
make
sense
sammy
said
noncommittally
this
was
the
best
day
of
his
life
the
giraffes
were
moving
off
but
a
flock
of
cranes
was
wheeling
overhead
in
quiet
splendor
i
tell
you
where
we
at
we
going
to
do
a
deal
with
you
a
fair
one
but
a
condition
of
the
deal
is
that
we
are
going
to
destroy
freddy
what
we
going
to
leak
him
bad
intel
on
the
deal
lots
of
it
give
him
a
whole
story
wait
until
he
publishes
it
and
then
sammy
sat
down
on
the
roof
this
was
going
to
be
a
long
conversation
perry
ground
his
teeth
and
squeezed
his
beer
the
idea
of
doing
this
in
a
big
group
had
seemed
like
a
good
idea
dirty
max
was
certainly
full
of
camaraderie
the
smell
of
roasting
meat
and
the
chatter
of
nearly
a
hundred
voices
he
heard
hilda
laughing
at
something
lester
said
to
her
and
there
were
kettlewell
and
his
kids
fingers
and
faces
sticky
with
sauce
lester
had
set
up
the
projector
and
they
hung
sheets
over
one
of
the
murals
for
a
screen
and
brought
out
a
bunch
of
wireless
speakers
that
they
scattered
around
the
courtyard
it
looked
smelled
sounded
and
tasted
like
a
carnival
but
perry
could
meet
anyone
eye
he
just
wanted
to
go
home
and
get
under
the
covers
they
were
about
to
destroy
freddy
which
had
also
seemed
like
a
hell
of
a
lark
at
the
time
but
now
perry
it
was
sammy
up
from
orlando
wearing
the
classic
bootleg
tee
can
you
get
fired
for
that
perry
pointed
sammy
shook
his
head
actually
it
official
i
had
them
produced
last
year
they
a
big
seller
if

and

large

took
it
from
him

it
up

put
down

his
tee
then
pulled
on

christ
almighty
well
at
least
you
not
going
to
end
up
my
employee
francis
who
had
an
uncanny
knack
for
figuring
out
the
right
moment
to
step
into
a
conversation
sidled
over
nice
shirt
perry
francis
this
is
sammy
francis
had
a
bottle
of
water
and
a
plate
of
ribs
so
he
extended
a
friendly
elbow
we
met
showed
him
the
bicycle
factory
sammy
visibly
calmed
himself
that
right
you
did
amazing
just
amazing
all
this
is
on
sammy
perry
said
pointing
at
the
huge
barbecue
smoker
the
crowds
of
gorgers
he
the
disney
guy
hence
the
shirts
huh
exactly
so
what
the
rumpus
exactly
francis
asked
it
all
been
around
here
for
a
solid
week
i
think
we
about
to
find
out
perry
said
nodding
at
the
gigantic
screen
which
rippled
in
the
sultry
florida
obscured
by
blowing
clouds
of
fragrant
smoke
it
was
lit
up
now
showing
cnnfn
two
anchors
talking
silently
into
the
night
the
speakers
popped
to
life
and
gradually
the
crowd
noises
dimmed
people
moved
toward
the
screen
all
except
francis
and
perry
and
sammy
who
hung
back
silently
watching
the
guest
on
the
show
is
freddy
niedbalski
a
technology
reporter
for
the
notorious
british
technology
publication
freddy
has
agreed
to
come
on
to
break
a
story
that
will
go
live
on
website
in
about
ten
minutes
the
camera
zoomed
out
to
show
freddy
sitting
beside
the
anchor
desk
in
an
armchair
his
paunch
was
more
pronounced
than
it
had
been
when
perry
had
seen
him
in
madison
and
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
makeup
a
color
mismatch
that
made
him
look
like
he
slathered
himself
with
still
he
was
grinning
evilly
and
looking
like
he
could
barely
contain
himself
thank
you
it
a
pleasure
now
take
us
through
the
story
you
been
covering
it
for
a
long
time
have
you
oh
yes
this
is
about
the
work
cult
and
its
aftermath
i
broken
a
series
of
scandals
involving
these
characters
over
the
years
weird
sex
funny
money
sweatshop
labor
these
are
the
people
who
spent
all
that
money
in
the
new
work
bubble
and
then
went
on
to
found
an
slum
that
they
characterized
as
a
laboratory
out
came
the
sarcastic
but
as
near
as
anyone
can
work
out
was
more
of
a
human
subject
experiment
gone
mad
they
pulled
off
these
bizarre
stunts
with
the
help
of
some
of
the
largest
investment
funds
on
the
planet
perry
looked
around
at
the
revellers
they
were
chortling
pointing
at
each
other
mugging
for
the
camera
freddy
words
made
perry
uncomfortable
maybe
there
was
something
to
what
he
said
but
there
was
francis
unofficial
mayor
of
the
shantytown
smiling
along
with
the
rest
they
had
been
perfect
but
they
left
the
world
a
better
place
than
they
found
it
there
are
many
personalities
in
this
story
but
tonight
installment
has
two
main
players
a
venture
capitalist
named
landon
kettlewell
and
a
disney
parks
senior
vice
president
called
sammy
page
technically
these
two
hate
each
others
guts
sammy
and
kettlewell
toasted
each
other
through
the
barbecue
smoke
but
they
been
chumming
up
to
one
another
lately
as
they
brokered
an
improbable
deal
to
shaft
everyone
else
in
the
sordid
mess
a
deal
that
you
got
details
on
for
us
tonight
exactly
my
sources
have
turned
up
reliable
memos
and
other
intelligence
indicating
that
the
investors
behind
the
shantytown
are
about
to
over
disney
it
all
stems
from
a
lawsuit
that
was
brought
on
behalf
of
a
syndicate
of
operators
of
bizarre
trademark
infringing
rides
that
were
raided
off
the
backs
of
complaints
from
disney
parks
these
raids
and
a
subsequent
and
very
suspicious
beating
of
an
park
employee
led
to
the
creation
of
an
investment
syndicate
to
fund
a
monster
lawsuit
against
disney
parks
one
that
could
take
the
company
down
the
investment
syndicate
found
an
unlikely
ally
in
the
person
of
sammy
page
the
senior
vp
from
disney
parks
who
worked
with
them
to
push
through
a
plan
where
they
would
settle
the
lawsuit
in
exchange
for
a
controlling
interest
in
disney
parks
the
anchors
looked
suitably
impressed
around
the
screen
the
partiers
had
gone
quiet
even
the
kids
mesmerized
by
freddy
giant
head
eyes
rolling
with
irony
and
mean
humor
and
that
just
for
starters
the
deal
required
securing
the
cooperation
of
the
employee
who
goes
by
the
name
of
waits
no
really
and
required
that
he
be
made
a
vice
president
of
the
new
company
as
well
running
the
section
of
the
florida
park
in
the
new
structure
the
two
founders
of
the
new
work
scam
perry
gibbons
and
lester
banks
are
to
oversee
the
disneyfication
of
the
activist
rides
around
the
country
selling
out
their
comrades
who
signed
over
control
of
their
enterprises
as
part
of
the
earlier
lawsuit
the
male
anchor
shook
his
head
if
this
is
true
it
the
strangest
turn
in
american
corporate
history
oh
yes
freddy
said
these
people
are
like
some
kind
of
poison
a
disease
that
affects
the
judgement
of
all
those
around
them
if
it
true
the
male
anchor
continued
as
if
freddy
spoken
but
is
it
our
next
guest
denies
all
of
this
and
claims
that
mr
niedbalski
has
his
facts
all
wrong
tjan
lee
tang
is
the
chairman
of
massachusetts
ride
theorists
a
nonprofit
that
operates
three
of
the
rides
in
new
england
he
is
in
our
boston
studios
welcome
mr
tang
freddy
expression
was
priceless
a
mixture
of
raw
terror
and
contempt
he
tried
to
cover
it
but
only
succeeded
in
looking
constipated
on
the
other
half
of
the
tjan
beamed
sunnily
at
them
hi
there
he
said
greetings
from
the
blustery
northeast
mr
tang
you
heard
what
our
guest
has
to
say
about
the
latest
developments
in
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
rides
you
helped
create
do
you
have
any
comment
i
certainly
do
freddy
old
buddy
you
been
had
whomever
your
leak
was
in
disney
he
was
putting
you
on
there
is
not
one
single
word
of
truth
to
anything
you
had
to
say
he
grinned
wickedly
so
what
else
is
new
freddy
opened
his
mouth
and
tjan
held
up
one
hand
no
wait
let
me
finish
i
know
it
your
schtick
to
come
after
us
this
way
been
at
it
for
years
i
think
it
because
you
have
an
unrequited
crush
on
suzanne
church
here
what
really
happening
lester
banks
and
perry
gibbons
have
taken
jobs
with
disney
parks
as
part
of
a
straightforward
deal
they
going
to
do
research
and
development
there
and
disney
is
settling
its
ongoing
lawsuit
with
us
with
a
seventy
million
dollar
cash
settlement
half
goes
to
the
investors
some
of
the
remainder
will
go
to
buy
the
underlying
titles
to
the
shantytown
and
put
them
in
a
trust
to
be
managed
by
a
of
residents
the
rest
is
going
into
another
trust
that
will
be
disbursed
in
grants
to
people
operating
rides
around
the
country
there
a
part
of
the
deal
too
all
rides
get
a
perpetual
worldwide
license
on
all
disney
trademarks
for
use
in
the
rides
the
announcers
smiled
and
nodded
we
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
win
the
rides
go
on
the
shantytown
goes
on
lester
and
perry
get
to
do
great
work
in
a
heavily
resourced
lab
environment
turned
to
freddy
it
seems
that
your
story
is
in
dispute
do
you
have
further
comment
freddy
squirmed
a
streak
of
sweat
cut
through
his
pancake
makeup
as
the
camera
came
in
for
a
closeup
well
if
this
is
true
i
want
to
know
why
disney
would
make
such
a
generous
offer
generous
tjan
said
he
snorted
we
were
asking
for
in
punitive
damages
they
got
off
easy
freddy
acted
like
he
had
heard
unless
the
terms
of
this
deal
are
published
and
subject
to
scrutiny
we
posted
them
about
five
minutes
ago
you
could
have
just
asked
us
you
know
freddy
eyes
bugged
out
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
what
this
man
is
saying
is
true
actually
you
do
like
i
say
it
all
online
the
deals
are
signed
securities
filings
and
everything
freddy
got
up
out
of
his
seat
you
shut
up
and
let
me
finish
he
screamed
sorry
sorry
tjan
said
with
a
chuckle
he
was
enjoying
this
way
too
much
go
on
and
what
about
death
waits
he
been
a
pawn
all
along
in
this
game
you
played
with
other
people
lives
what
happens
to
him
as
you
all
get
rich
tjan
shrugged
he
got
a
large
cash
settlement
too
he
seemed
pretty
happy
about
it
freddy
was
shaking
you
ca
just
sell
off
your
lawsuit
we
were
looking
to
get
compensated
for
bad
acts
we
got
compensated
for
them
and
we
did
it
without
tying
up
the
public
courts
everybody
wins
he
cocked
his
head
except
you
of
course
this
was
a
fucking
ambush
freddy
said
pointing
his
fingers
at
the
two
coiffed
and
groomed
anchors
who
shied
away
dramatically
making
him
look
even
crazier
he
stormed
off
the
stage
cursing
every
word
transmitted
by
his
wireless
mic
he
shouted
at
an
invisible
security
guard
to
get
out
of
his
way
then
they
heard
him
make
a
presumably
to
his
editor
shouting
at
him
to
kill
the
article
nearly
weeping
in
frustration
the
anchors
and
tjan
pasted
on
unconvincing
but
around
the
bbq
pit
it
was
all
howls
of
laughter
which
turned
to
shrieks
when
freddy
finally
figured
out
that
he
was
still
on
a
live
mic
perry
and
sammy
locked
eyes
and
grinned
perry
ticked
a
little
salute
off
his
forehead
at
sammy
and
hefted
his
tee
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
into
the
night
the
fragrant
smell
of
the
barbecue
smoke
and
the
sound
of
the
party
behind
him
he
parked
his
car
at
home
and
trudged
up
the
stairs
hilda
had
packed
her
suitcase
that
morning
he
had
a
lot
more
than
a
suitcase
worth
of
stuff
around
the
apartment
but
as
he
threw
a
few
including
his
new
fake
bootleg
mickey
tee
and
some
underwear
in
a
bag
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
did
care
about
any
of
it
then
he
happened
upon
the
baseball
glove
the
cloud
of
old
leather
smell
it
emitted
when
he
picked
it
up
made
tears
spring
into
his
eyes
he
had
cried
through
any
of
this
process
though
and
he
was
about
to
start
now
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
forearm
and
reverently
set
the
glove
into
his
bag
and
shut
it
he
carried
both
bags
downstairs
and
put
them
in
the
trunk
then
he
drove
to
just
a
little
ways
north
of
the
ride
and
called
hilda
to
let
her
know
he
was
ready
to
go
she
did
say
a
word
when
she
got
in
the
car
and
neither
did
he
all
the
way
to
miami
airport
he
took
his
frisking
and
secondary
screening
in
stoic
silence
and
once
they
were
seated
on
the
chicago
flight
he
put
his
head
down
on
hilda
shoulder
and
she
stroked
his
hair
until
he
fell
asleep
epilogue
lester
was
in
his
workshop
when
perry
came
to
see
him
he
had
the
yoga
mat
out
and
he
was
going
through
the
slow
exercises
that
his
physiotherapist
had
assigned
to
him
stretching
his
crumbling
bones
and
shrinking
muscles
trying
to
keep
it
all
together
he
fired
three
physios
but
suzanne
kept
finding
him
new
ones
and
because
she
loved
him
prettier
ones
he
was
down
on
all
fours
his
ass
stuck
way
up
in
the
air
when
perry
came
through
the
door
he
looked
back
through
his
ankles
and
squinted
at
the
world
perry
expression
was
carefully
neutral
the
same
as
it
would
be
he
grunted
and
went
down
to
his
knees
which
crackled
like
popcorn
that
does
sound
good
perry
remarked
mildly
funny
man
lester
said
get
over
here
and
help
me
up
will
you
perry
went
down
in
a
crouch
before
him
there
was
something
funny
about
his
eye
the
whole
side
of
his
head
he
smelled
a
little
sweaty
and
a
little
gamy
but
the
face
was
the
one
lester
knew
so
well
perry
held
out
his
strong
leathery
hands
and
after
a
moment
lester
grasped
them
and
let
perry
drag
him
to
his
feet
they
stood
facing
one
another
for
an
uncomfortable
moment
hands
clasped
together
then
perry
flung
his
arms
wide
and
shouted
here
i
am
lester
laughed
and
embraced
his
old
friend
not
seen
or
heard
from
these
last
years
lester
workshop
had
a
sofa
where
he
entertained
visitors
and
took
his
afternoon
nap
normally
he
use
his
cane
to
cross
from
his
workbench
to
the
sofa
but
seeing
perry
threw
him
for
such
a
loop
that
he
completely
forgot
until
he
was
a
pace
or
two
away
from
it
and
then
he
found
himself
flailing
for
support
as
his
hips
started
to
give
way
perry
caught
him
under
the
shoulders
and
propped
him
up
lester
felt
a
rush
of
shame
color
his
cheeks
steady
there
cowboy
perry
said
sorry
sorry
lester
muttered
perry
lowered
him
to
the
sofa
then
looked
around
you
got
anything
to
drink
water
i
did
really
expect
the
bus
would
take
as
long
as
it
did
you
taking
the
bus
around
burbank
lester
said
christ
perry
this
is
los
angeles
even
homeless
people
drive
cars
perry
looked
away
and
shook
his
head
the
bus
is
cheaper
lester
pursed
his
lips
you
got
anything
to
drink
in
the
fridge
lester
said
pointing
to
a
set
of
nested
clay
pot
evaporative
coolers
perry
grinned
at
the
cooler
and
rummaged
around
in
its
mouth
for
a
while
anything
you
know
buzzy
guarana
caffeine
even
lester
gave
an
apologetic
shrug
not
me
not
anymore
nothing
goes
into
my
body
without
oversight
by
a
team
of
very
expensive
nutritionists
you
do
look
so
bad
perry
said
maybe
a
little
skinny
lester
cut
him
off
not
bad
like
the
people
you
see
on
tv
huh
not
bad
like
the
dying
ones
the
fatkins
had
overwhelmed
the
hospitals
in
successive
waves
of
sickened
disintegrating
skeletons
whose
brittle
bones
and
ruined
joints
had
outstripped
anyone
ability
to
cope
with
them
the
only
thing
that
kept
the
crisis
from
boiling
over
entirely
was
the
fast
mortality
that
followed
on
the
first
symptoms
difficulty
digesting
persistent
stiffness
once
you
could
keep
down
slurry
you
just
starved
to
death
not
like
them
perry
agreed
he
had
a
bit
of
limp
lester
saw
and
his
old
broken
arm
hung
slightly
stiff
at
his
side
i
doing
ok
lester
said
you
would
believe
the
medical
bills
of
course
do
let
freddy
know
you
got
the
sickness
perry
said
love
that
story
pioneer
pays
the
price
freddy
man
i
have
thought
of
that
shitheel
in
christ
a
decade
at
least
is
he
still
alive
perry
shrugged
might
be
i
think
that
if
he
keeled
over
someone
would
have
asked
me
to
pitch
in
to
charter
a
bus
to
go
piss
on
his
grave
lester
laughed
hard
so
hard
he
hurt
his
chest
and
had
to
sag
back
into
the
sofa
doing
deep
yoga
breathing
until
his
ribs
felt
better
perry
sat
down
opposite
him
on
the
sofa
with
a
bottle
of
special
flat
water
in
a
bottle
suzanne
he
asked
good
lester
said
spends
about
half
her
time
here
and
half
on
the
road
writing
still
what
she
on
to
now
cooking
if
you
can
believe
it
molecular
gastronomy
food
hackers
who
use
centrifuges
to
clarify
their
consomme
she
says
she
never
eaten
better
last
week
it
was
some
kid
who
written
a
genetic
algorithm
to
evolve
custom
printable
molecules
that
can
bridge
two
unharmonius
flavors
to
make
them
taste
good
together
like
what
do
you
need
to
add
to
chocolate
and
sardines
to
make
them
delicious
is
there
such
a
molecule
suzanne
says
there
is
she
said
that
they
misted
it
into
her
face
with
a
vaporizer
while
she
ate
a
sardine
on
a
slab
of
dark
chocolate
and
it
tasted
better
than
anything
she
ever
had
before
ok
that
just
wrong
perry
said
the
two
of
them
were
grinning
at
each
other
like
fools
lester
could
believe
how
good
it
felt
to
be
in
the
same
room
as
perry
again
after
all
these
years
his
old
friend
was
much
older
than
the
last
time
they
seen
each
other
there
was
a
lot
of
grey
in
his
short
hair
and
his
hairline
was
a
lot
higher
up
his
forehead
his
knuckles
were
swollen
and
wrinkled
and
his
face
had
deep
lines
making
him
look
carved
he
had
the
leathery
skin
of
a
roadside
homeless
person
and
there
were
little
scars
all
over
his
arms
and
a
few
on
his
throat
how
hilda
lester
asked
perry
looked
away
that
a
name
i
have
heard
in
a
while
he
said
yowch
sorry
no
that
ok
i
get
email
blasts
from
her
every
now
and
again
chipper
and
scrappy
as
always
fighting
the
good
fight
fatkins
stuff
again
same
as
when
i
met
her
funny
how
that
fight
never
gets
old
hardy
har
har
lester
said
ok
we
even
perry
said
on
the
tournament
they
chatted
about
inconsequentialities
for
a
while
stories
about
lester
life
as
the
closeted
genius
at
disney
labs
perry
life
on
the
road
getting
itinerant
and
seasonal
work
at
little
do
they
recognize
you
me
naw
it
been
a
long
time
since
i
got
recognized
i
just
the
guy
you
know
he
handy
keeps
to
himself
probably
going
to
be
moving
on
soon
good
with
money
always
has
a
quiet
suggestion
for
tweaking
an
idea
to
make
it
return
a
little
higher
on
the
investment
that
you
all
right
all
except
the
to
himself
part
a
little
older
a
little
wiser
better
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
be
thought
a
fool
than
to
open
it
and
remove
all
doubt
thank
you
mister
twain
you
and
huck
been
on
the
river
a
while
then
no
huck
he
said
his
smile
got
sad
heartbreakingly
sad
this
was
the
perry
lester
knew
lester
was
the
same
person
either
they
were
both
broken
perry
was
alone
though
gregarious
perry
always
making
friends
alone
so
how
long
are
you
staying
i
just
passing
through
buddy
i
woke
up
in
burbank
this
morning
and
i
thought
lester
in
burbank
i
should
say
hello
but
i
got
places
to
go
come
on
man
stay
a
while
we
got
a
out
back
a
little
apartment
there
are
fruit
trees
too
living
the
dream
huh
he
sounded
unexpectedly
bitter
lester
was
embarrassed
for
his
wealth
disney
had
thrown
so
much
stock
at
him
in
the
beginning
and
suzanne
had
sold
most
of
it
and
wisely
invested
it
in
a
bunch
of
add
to
that
the
money
she
was
raking
in
from
the
affiliate
sites
her
junior
woodchucks
she
trained
and
set
up
in
business
ran
and
they
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
well
apart
from
dying
and
working
here
as
soon
as
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
he
wished
he
could
take
them
back
he
never
let
on
that
he
was
happy
at
the
mouse
and
the
dying
thing
well
suzanne
and
he
liked
to
pretend
that
medical
science
would
cure
what
it
had
brought
perry
though
he
just
nodded
as
if
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
must
be
hard
on
suzanne
now
that
was
hitting
the
nail
on
the
head
you
always
were
a
perceptive
son
of
a
bitch
she
never
said
fatkins
was
good
for
you
she
just
reported
the
story
the
people
who
blame
her
this
was
the
elephant
in
the
room
whenever
lester
and
suzanne
talked
about
his
health
between
the
two
of
them
they
popularized
fatkins
sent
millions
winging
to
russia
for
the
clinics
fuelled
the
creation
of
the
clinics
in
the
us
and
mexico
but
they
never
spoke
of
it
never
now
perry
was
talking
about
it
still
talking
the
fda
the
doctors
that
what
we
pay
them
for
the
way
i
see
it
you
a
victim
their
victim
lester
could
say
anything
words
stoppered
themselves
up
in
his
mouth
like
a
cork
finally
he
managed
to
choke
out
change
the
subject
ok
perry
looked
down
sorry
i
out
of
practice
with
people
i
hope
you
stay
with
us
he
said
thinking
hope
you
leave
soon
and
never
come
you
miss
it
huh
sometimes
you
said
working
here
working
here
they
said
that
they
wanted
me
to
come
in
and
help
them
turn
the
place
around
help
them
reinvent
themselves
be
nimble
shake
things
up
but
it
like
wrestling
a
you
push
you
get
stuck
you
argue
for
something
better
and
they
tell
you
to
write
a
report
then
no
one
reads
the
report
you
try
to
get
an
experimental
service
running
and
no
one
will
reconfigure
the
firewall
turn
the
place
around
he
snorted
it
like
turning
around
a
battleship
by
tapping
it
on
the
nose
with
a
toothpick
i
hate
working
with
assholes
they
not
assholes
that
the
thing
perry
they
some
really
smart
people
they
nice
we
have
them
over
for
dinner
they
fun
to
eat
lunch
with
the
thing
is
single
one
of
them
feels
the
same
way
i
they
have
cool
shit
they
want
to
do
but
they
ca
do
it
why
it
like
an
emergent
property
once
you
get
a
lot
of
people
under
one
roof
the
emergent
property
seems
to
be
crap
no
matter
how
great
the
people
are
no
matter
how
wonderful
their
individual
ideas
are
the
net
effect
is
shit
reminds
me
of
reliability
calculation
like
if
you
take
two
components
that
are
percent
reliable
and
use
them
in
a
design
the
outcome
is
percent
of
percent
percent
keep
adding
percent
reliable
components
and
you
have
something
that
explodes
before
you
get
it
out
of
the
factory
maybe
people
are
like
that
if
you
percent
and
ten
percent
bogus
and
you
work
with
someone
else
who
percent
you
end
up
with
a
team
that
percent
i
like
that
model
it
makes
intuitive
sense
but
fuck
me
depressing
it
says
that
all
we
do
is
magnify
each
others
flaws
well
maybe
that
the
case
maybe
flaws
are
multiplicative
so
what
are
virtues
additive
maybe
a
shallower
curve
that
be
an
interesting
research
project
if
you
could
come
up
with
some
quantitative
measurements
so
what
do
you
do
around
here
all
day
lester
blushed
what
i
building
bigger
mechanical
computers
mostly
i
print
them
out
using
the
new
volumetrics
and
have
research
assistants
assemble
them
there
something
soothing
about
them
i
have
an
apple
clone
running
entirely
on
physical
gates
made
out
of
extruded
plastic
skulls
it
takes
up
an
entire
building
out
on
one
of
the
lots
and
when
you
play
pong
on
it
the
sound
of
the
jaws
clacking
is
like
listening
to
corpse
beetles
skeletonizing
an
elephant
i
think
i
like
to
see
that
perry
said
laughing
a
little
that
can
be
arranged
lester
said
they
were
like
gears
that
had
once
emerged
from
a
mill
with
perfectly
precise
teeth
gears
that
could
mesh
and
spin
against
each
other
transferring
energy
they
were
like
gears
that
had
been
in
machines
apart
from
each
other
until
their
precise
teeth
had
been
chipped
and
bent
so
that
they
no
longer
meshed
they
were
like
gears
connected
to
one
another
and
mismatched
clunking
and
skipping
but
running
still
running
still
perry
and
lester
rode
in
the
back
of
the
company
car
the
driver
an
old
armenian
who
fled
azerbaijan
whom
lester
introduced
as
kapriel
it
seemed
that
lester
and
kapriel
were
old
friends
which
made
sense
since
lester
could
drive
himself
and
in
los
angeles
you
did
go
anywhere
except
by
car
the
relationship
between
a
man
and
his
driver
would
be
necessarily
intimate
perry
could
bring
himself
to
feel
envious
of
lester
having
a
chauffeured
car
though
it
was
clear
that
lester
was
embarrassed
by
the
luxury
it
was
too
much
like
an
invalid
subsidy
to
feel
excessive
kap
lester
said
stirring
in
the
nest
of
paper
and
parts
and
empty
packages
that
he
made
of
the
kapriel
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
them
home
now
he
barely
had
an
accent
but
when
he
turned
his
head
perry
saw
that
one
ear
had
been
badly
mangled
leaving
behind
a
misshapen
fist
of
scar
no
lester
said
let
eat
out
tonight
how
about
musso
and
frank
ms
suzanne
says
we
do
need
to
tell
her
lester
said
perry
spoke
in
a
low
voice
lester
i
do
need
anything
special
do
make
yourself
sick
perry
buddy
shut
the
fuck
up
ok
i
can
have
a
steak
and
a
beer
and
a
dessert
every
now
and
again
purified
medicated
gets
old
my
colon
is
going
to
fall
out
of
my
asshole
in
terror
if
i
send
a
cheeseburger
down
there
they
parked
behind
musso
and
frank
and
let
the
valet
park
the
town
car
kapriel
went
over
to
the
walk
of
fame
to
take
pictures
of
the
robotic
movie
stars
doing
acrobatic
busking
acts
and
they
went
into
the
dark
cave
of
the
restaurant
all
dark
wood
dark
carpets
pictures
of
movie
stars
on
the
walls
the
maitre
d
gave
them
a
look
tilted
his
head
looked
again
calmly
lester
produced
a
bill
and
slid
it
across
the
podium
we
like
orson
welles
table
please
he
said
the
maitre
d
an
elderly
elegant
mexican
with
a
precise
spade
beard
nodded
affably
give
me
five
minutes
gentlemen
would
you
care
to
have
a
drink
in
the
bar
they
sat
at
the
long
counter
and
perry
ordered
a
scotch
and
soda
lester
ordered
water
then
switched
his
order
to
beer
then
beer
then
beer
again
sorry
he
said
to
the
waitress
just
having
an
indecisive
kind
of
night
i
guess
perry
tried
to
figure
out
if
lester
had
been
showing
off
with
the
and
decided
that
he
had
been
he
just
gone
native
in
la
and
a
hundred
for
the
maitre
d
when
you
in
a
hurry
ca
be
much
for
a
senior
exec
lester
sipped
gingerly
at
his
beer
i
like
this
place
he
said
waving
the
bottle
at
the
celebrity
caricatures
lining
the
walls
perfect
hollyweird
kitsch
celebrities
who
usually
eat
out
in
some
place
come
here
they
come
because
they
always
come
to
sit
in
orson
welles
booth
how
the
food
depends
on
what
you
order
the
good
stuff
is
great
you
down
for
steaks
i
down
for
whatever
perry
said
lester
was
in
his
medium
here
letting
the
waiter
unfold
his
napkin
and
lay
it
over
his
lap
without
taking
any
special
notice
of
the
old
man
the
food
was
delicious
and
they
even
got
to
glimpse
a
celebrity
though
neither
perry
nor
lester
knew
who
the
young
woman
was
nor
what
she
was
famous
for
she
was
surrounded
by
children
who
came
over
from
other
tables
seeking
autographs
and
more
than
one
patron
snapped
a
photo
of
her
poor
girl
perry
said
with
feeling
it
a
career
decision
here
you
decide
to
become
famous
because
you
want
that
kind
of
life
sometimes
you
even
kid
yourself
that
last
forever
that
in
thirty
years
they
come
into
musso
and
frank
and
ask
for
miss
whatshername
table
anyone
who
wants
to
know
what
stardom
looks
like
can
find
out
and
no
one
becomes
a
star
by
accident
you
think
perry
said
i
mean
we
were
celebs
kind
of
for
a
while
there
are
you
saying
that
that
happened
by
accident
i
never
set
out
to
get
famous
you
took
part
in
a
national
movement
perry
you
practically
it
what
did
you
think
was
going
to
happen
you
saying
that
we
were
just
attention
whores
no
perry
no
we
were
attention
whores
we
were
attention
whores
we
built
and
ran
cool
shit
there
nothing
wrong
with
being
an
attention
whore
it
an
attention
economy
if
you
going
to
be
a
working
stiff
you
should
pick
a
decent
currency
to
get
paid
in
but
you
ca
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
it
did
feel
good
did
feel
to
have
all
those
people
looking
up
to
us
following
us
into
battle
throwing
themselves
at
us
perry
held
up
his
hands
his
friend
was
looking
more
alive
than
he
had
at
any
time
since
perry
had
been
ushered
into
his
workshop
he
sat
up
straight
and
the
old
glint
of
mischief
and
good
humor
was
in
his
eye
i
surrender
buddy
you
right
they
ordered
desserts
heavy
diplomat
puddings
bread
pudding
made
with
cake
and
cherries
and
lester
dug
in
after
making
perry
swear
not
to
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
suzanne
he
ate
with
such
visible
pleasure
that
perry
felt
like
a
voyeur
how
long
did
you
say
you
were
in
town
for
i
just
passing
through
perry
said
he
had
only
planned
on
maybe
seeing
lester
long
enough
for
lunch
or
something
now
it
seemed
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
be
put
up
in
the
guest
cottage
he
thought
about
getting
back
on
the
road
there
was
a
little
gang
in
oregon
that
made
novelty
school
supplies
they
were
always
ramping
up
for
their
busy
season
at
this
time
of
year
they
were
good
people
to
work
for
come
on
where
you
got
to
be
stay
a
week
i
put
you
on
the
payroll
as
a
consultant
you
can
give
talks
to
the
r
d
team
whatever
you
want
lester
you
just
got
through
telling
me
how
much
you
hate
your
job
that
the
beauty
of
contracting
you
do
stick
around
long
enough
to
hate
it
and
you
never
have
to
worry
about
the
org
chart
come
on
pal
i
think
about
it
lester
fell
asleep
on
the
car
ride
home
and
kapriel
did
mind
if
perry
did
want
to
chat
so
he
just
rolled
his
windows
down
and
watched
the
la
lights
scream
past
as
they
hit
the
premium
lanes
on
the
crosstown
freeways
heading
to
lester
place
in
topanga
canyon
when
they
arrived
lester
roused
himself
heavily
clutched
his
stomach
then
raced
for
the
house
kapriel
shook
his
head
and
rolled
his
eyes
then
showed
perry
to
the
front
door
and
shook
his
hand
in
the
morning
he
prowled
lester
and
suzanne
place
like
a
burglar
the
guesthouse
had
once
served
as
lester
workshop
and
it
had
the
telltale
leavings
of
a
busy
inventor
drawers
and
tubs
of
parts
a
moldy
in
a
pens
and
toys
and
unread
postal
spam
in
piles
what
it
did
have
was
a
kitchen
so
perry
helped
himself
to
the
key
that
lester
had
left
him
with
the
night
before
and
wandered
around
the
big
house
looking
for
the
kitchen
it
turned
out
to
be
on
the
second
floor
a
bit
of
weird
architectural
design
that
was
characteristic
of
the
place
which
had
started
as
a
shack
in
the
hills
on
several
acres
of
land
and
then
grown
and
grown
as
successive
generations
of
owners
had
added
extensions
seismic
retrofitting
and
new
floors
perry
found
the
pantries
filled
with
mres
each
nutritionally
balanced
and
fortified
in
ways
calculated
to
make
lester
as
healthy
as
possible
finally
he
found
a
small
cupboard
clearly
devoted
to
suzanne
eating
with
boxes
of
breakfast
cereal
and
way
in
the
back
a
little
bag
of
oreos
he
munched
thoughtfully
on
the
cookies
while
drinking
more
of
the
flat
water
he
heard
lester
totter
into
a
bathroom
on
the
floor
above
and
called
good
morning
up
a
narrow
winding
staircase
lester
groaned
back
at
him
a
sound
that
perry
had
heard
in
years
that
theatrical
sound
he
clomped
down
the
stairs
with
his
cane
wearing
a
pair
of
and
rubber
slippers
he
was
gaunt
the
hair
on
his
sunken
chest
gone
wiry
grey
and
the
skin
around
his
torso
sagged
from
the
neck
down
he
looked
a
hundred
years
old
perry
looked
away
morning
bro
lester
said
and
took
a
pouch
out
of
a
medical
white
box
over
the
sink
tore
it
open
added
purified
water
and
put
it
in
the
microwave
the
smell
was
like
wet
cardboard
in
a
dumpster
perry
wrinkled
his
nose
tastes
better
than
it
smells
or
looks
lester
said
very
easy
on
the
digestion
which
i
need
never
let
me
pig
out
like
that
again
ok
he
collapsed
heavily
into
a
stool
and
closed
his
sunken
eyes
without
opening
them
he
said
so
are
you
in
am
i
in
you
going
to
come
on
board
as
my
consultant
you
were
serious
about
that
huh
perry
they
ca
fire
me
if
i
quit
i
lose
my
health
bennies
which
means
i
be
broke
in
a
month
which
puts
us
at
an
impasse
i
past
feeling
guilty
about
doing
nothing
much
all
day
long
but
that
mean
i
not
bored
you
make
it
sound
so
attractive
you
got
something
better
to
do
i
in
suzanne
came
home
a
week
later
and
found
them
sitting
up
in
the
living
room
they
pushed
all
the
furniture
up
against
the
walls
and
covered
the
floor
with
boards
laid
or
overlapping
they
had
tokens
cards
and
money
from
several
of
the
games
laid
out
around
the
rims
of
the
games
what
the
blistering
fuck
she
said
good
naturedly
lester
had
told
her
that
perry
was
around
so
she
been
prepared
for
something
odd
but
this
was
pretty
amazing
even
so
lester
held
up
a
hand
for
silence
and
rolled
two
dice
they
skittered
across
the
floor
one
of
them
slipping
through
the
three
points
perry
said
one
for
not
going
into
the
grating
two
for
going
into
the
grating
i
thought
we
said
it
was
two
points
for
not
going
into
the
grating
and
one
for
dropping
it
let
call
it
points
for
each
gentlemen
suzanne
said
i
believe
i
asked
a
question
to
wit
the
blistering
fuck
calvinball
lester
said
like
in
the
old
calvin
and
hobbes
strips
the
rules
are
the
rules
can
never
be
the
same
twice
and
you
supposed
to
wear
a
mask
perry
said
but
we
kept
stepping
on
the
pieces
no
peripheral
vision
lester
said
caucus
race
perry
yelled
and
took
a
lap
around
the
world
lester
struggled
to
his
feet
then
flopped
back
down
i
disbelieve
he
said
taking
up
two
dice
and
rolling
them
he
said
fine
perry
said
he
picked
up
a
battleship
board
and
said
and
then
he
said
what
the
score
anyway
orange
to
seven
lester
said
who
orange
you
are
shit
ok
let
take
a
break
suzanne
tried
to
hold
in
her
laughter
but
she
could
she
ended
up
doubled
over
tears
streaming
down
her
face
when
she
straightened
up
lester
hobbled
to
her
and
gave
her
a
surprisingly
strong
hug
he
smelled
like
lester
like
the
man
she
shared
her
bed
with
all
these
years
perry
held
out
his
hand
to
her
and
she
yanked
him
into
a
long
hard
hug
it
good
to
have
you
back
perry
she
said
once
she
kissed
both
his
cheeks
it
fantastic
to
see
you
suzanne
he
said
he
was
thinner
than
she
remembered
with
snow
on
the
roof
but
he
was
still
handsome
as
a
pirate
we
missed
you
tell
me
everything
you
been
up
to
it
not
interesting
he
said
really
i
find
that
difficult
to
believe
so
he
told
them
stories
from
the
road
and
they
were
interesting
in
a
kind
of
microcosm
sort
of
way
stories
about
interesting
characters
he
met
improbable
meals
he
eaten
bad
working
conditions
memorable
rides
hitched
so
that
it
suzanne
said
that
what
you
done
it
what
i
do
he
said
and
you
happy
i
not
sad
he
said
she
shook
her
head
involuntarily
perry
stiffened
what
wrong
with
not
sad
there
nothing
wrong
with
it
perry
i
she
faltered
searched
for
the
words
remember
when
i
first
met
you
met
both
of
you
in
that
ghost
mall
you
were
just
happy
you
were
hysterical
remember
the
elmos
the
car
they
drove
perry
looked
away
yeah
he
said
softly
there
was
a
hitch
in
his
voice
all
i
saying
is
it
does
have
to
be
this
way
you
could
could
what
he
said
he
sounded
angry
but
she
thought
that
he
was
just
upset
i
could
go
work
for
disney
sit
in
a
workshop
all
day
making
crap
no
one
cares
about
be
the
for
the
end
of
my
days
a
caged
monkey
for
some
corporate
sultan
zoo
the
phrase
was
lester
and
suzanne
knew
then
that
perry
and
lester
had
been
talking
about
it
lester
leaning
heavily
against
her
on
the
sofa
they
pushed
it
back
into
the
room
moving
aside
pieces
of
the
calvinball
game
made
a
warning
sound
and
gave
her
knee
a
squeeze
aha
definitely
territory
they
covered
before
then
you
two
have
some
of
the
finest
entrepreneurial
instincts
i
ever
encountered
she
said
perry
snorted
what
more
i
never
seen
you
happier
than
you
were
back
when
i
first
met
you
making
stuff
for
the
sheer
joy
of
it
and
selling
it
to
collectors
do
you
know
how
many
collectors
would
pony
up
for
an
original
today
you
two
could
just
do
that
forever
lester
medical
lester
medical
nothing
you
two
get
together
on
this
you
could
make
so
much
money
we
could
buy
lester
his
own
hospital
lester
wo
last
long
no
matter
what
she
did
say
it
but
there
it
was
she
come
to
grips
with
the
reality
years
ago
when
his
symptoms
first
appeared
when
the
fatkins
symptoms
began
to
appear
now
she
could
think
of
it
without
getting
that
hitch
in
her
chest
that
she
gotten
at
first
now
she
could
go
away
for
a
week
to
work
on
a
story
without
weeping
every
night
then
drying
her
eyes
and
calling
lester
to
make
sure
he
was
still
alive
i
not
saying
you
need
to
do
this
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
or
forever
is
no
forever
for
but
you
two
would
have
to
be
insane
not
to
try
it
look
at
this
thing
you
done
calvinball
perry
said
calvinball
right
you
were
made
for
this
you
two
make
each
other
better
perry
let
be
honest
here
you
do
have
anything
better
to
do
she
held
her
breath
it
had
been
years
since
she
spoken
to
perry
years
since
she
had
the
right
to
say
things
like
that
to
him
once
upon
a
time
she
would
have
thought
twice
but
now
let
me
sleep
on
it
perry
said
which
meant
no
of
course
perry
did
sleep
on
things
he
decided
to
do
things
sometimes
he
decided
wrong
but
he
never
had
trouble
deciding
that
night
lester
rubbed
her
back
the
way
he
always
did
when
she
came
back
from
the
road
using
the
she
kept
on
her
his
hands
had
once
been
so
mechanic
hands
pistons
he
could
drive
tirelessly
into
the
knots
in
her
back
now
they
smoothed
and
petted
a
rub
not
a
massage
every
time
she
came
home
it
was
gentler
somehow
more
loving
but
she
missed
her
massages
sometimes
she
thought
she
should
tell
him
not
to
bother
anymore
but
she
was
afraid
of
what
it
would
mean
to
end
this
ritual
and
how
many
more
rituals
would
end
in
its
wake
it
was
the
briefest
backrub
yet
and
then
he
slid
under
the
covers
with
her
she
held
him
for
a
long
time
spooning
him
from
behind
her
face
in
the
nape
of
his
neck
kissing
his
collar
bone
the
way
he
liked
and
he
moaned
softly
i
love
you
suzanne
he
said
what
brought
that
on
it
just
good
to
have
you
home
he
said
you
seem
to
have
been
taking
pretty
good
care
of
yourself
while
i
was
away
getting
in
some
perry
time
i
took
him
to
musso
and
frank
he
said
i
ate
like
a
pig
and
you
paid
the
price
did
you
yeah
for
days
serves
you
right
that
perry
is
a
bad
influence
on
my
boy
i
miss
him
you
think
he
go
then
you
know
he
will
oh
honey
some
wounds
do
heal
he
said
i
guess
i
sure
it
not
that
suzanne
said
he
loves
you
i
bet
this
is
the
best
week
he
had
in
years
so
why
would
he
want
to
stay
lester
voice
came
out
in
the
petulant
she
had
only
ever
heard
when
he
was
in
extreme
physical
pain
it
was
a
voice
she
heard
more
and
more
often
lately
maybe
he
just
afraid
of
himself
he
been
on
the
run
for
a
long
time
you
have
to
ask
yourself
what
he
running
from
it
seems
to
me
that
he
spent
his
whole
life
trying
to
avoid
having
to
look
himself
in
the
eye
lester
sighed
and
she
squeezed
him
tight
how
we
get
so
screwed
up
oh
baby
she
said
we
not
screwed
up
we
just
people
who
want
to
do
things
big
things
any
time
you
want
to
make
a
difference
you
face
the
possibility
that
you
you
know
make
a
difference
it
a
consequence
of
doing
things
with
consequences
gak
he
said
you
always
get
so
when
you
on
the
road
gives
me
time
to
reflect
were
you
reading
was
i
reading
suzanne
i
read
your
posts
whenever
i
feel
lonely
it
kind
of
like
having
you
home
with
me
you
sweet
did
you
really
eat
sardines
on
sorbet
toast
do
knock
it
it
better
than
it
sounds
lots
better
you
can
keep
it
listen
to
mr
musso
and
frank
boy
you
got
no
business
criticizing
anyone
else
food
choices
he
heaved
a
happy
sigh
i
love
you
suzanne
church
you
a
good
man
lester
banks
perry
met
them
at
the
breakfast
table
the
next
morning
as
suzanne
was
fiddling
with
the
espresso
machine
steaming
soy
milk
for
her
latte
he
wore
a
pair
of
lester
sloppy
drawstring
pants
and
a
for
a
motorcycle
shop
in
kansas
city
that
was
spotted
with
old
stains
bom
dia
he
said
and
chucked
lester
on
the
shoulder
he
was
carrying
himself
with
a
certain
stiffness
and
suzanne
thought
it
comes
he
going
to
say
goodbye
perry
gibbons
you
bastard
morning
lester
said
brittle
and
chipper
perry
dug
around
on
suzanne
for
a
while
and
came
up
with
a
bagel
for
the
toaster
and
a
jar
of
peanut
butter
no
one
said
anything
while
he
dug
around
for
the
big
bread
knife
found
the
cutting
board
toasted
the
bagel
spread
peanut
butter
and
took
a
bite
suzanne
and
lester
just
continued
to
eat
in
uncomfortable
silence
him
suzanne
urged
silently
it
over
with
damn
you
i
in
perry
said
around
a
mouthful
of
bagel
looking
away
suzanne
saw
that
he
had
purple
bags
under
his
eyes
like
he
slept
a
wink
all
night
i
staying
if
you
have
me
let
make
some
stuff
he
put
the
bagel
down
and
swallowed
he
looked
back
at
lester
and
the
two
old
comrades
locked
eyes
for
a
long
moment
lester
smiled
all
right
he
danced
a
shuffling
step
mindful
of
his
sore
hips
all
right
buddy
yeah
suzanne
tried
to
fade
then
to
back
out
of
the
room
and
let
them
do
their
thing
but
lester
caught
her
arm
and
drew
her
into
an
embrace
tugging
on
her
arm
with
a
strength
she
forgotten
he
had
he
gave
her
a
hard
kiss
i
love
you
suzanne
church
he
said
you
my
savior
perry
made
a
happy
sound
behind
her
i
love
you
too
lester
she
said
squeezing
his
skinny
brittle
back
lester
let
go
of
her
and
she
turned
to
face
perry
tears
pricked
his
eyes
and
she
found
that
she
was
crying
too
she
gave
him
a
hug
and
felt
the
ways
that
his
body
had
changed
since
she
held
him
back
in
florida
back
in
some
forgotten
time
he
was
thicker
but
still
solid
and
he
smelled
the
same
she
put
her
lips
close
to
his
ear
and
whispered
you
a
good
man
perry
gibbons
lester
gave
his
notice
that
morning
though
it
was
in
tehran
when
lester
called
sammy
was
at
his
desk
why
are
you
telling
me
this
lester
it
says
in
my
contract
that
i
have
to
give
my
notice
to
you
specifically
why
the
hell
did
i
put
that
there
sammy
voice
sounded
far
away
not
just
in
iran
it
sounded
like
he
had
travelled
through
time
too
politics
i
think
he
said
hard
to
remember
probably
wanted
to
be
sure
that
someone
like
wiener
would
convince
you
to
quit
switch
companies
and
hire
you
again
not
much
risk
of
that
now
lester
said
let
face
it
sammy
i
do
actually
do
anything
for
the
company
nope
that
right
we
not
very
good
at
making
use
of
people
like
you
nope
well
email
me
your
paperwork
and
i
shove
it
around
how
much
notice
are
you
supposed
to
give
three
months
yowch
whatever
just
pack
up
and
go
home
gardening
leave
it
had
been
two
years
since
lester
had
any
contact
with
sammy
but
it
was
clear
that
running
iranian
ops
had
mellowed
him
out
harder
to
get
into
trouble
with
women
there
anyway
how
iran
treating
you
the
middle
east
operation
is
something
else
boy
you
like
it
here
the
towns
all
look
like
your
squatter
city
the
craziest
buildings
you
ever
saw
they
love
the
diabs
though
we
get
the
most
fantastic
designs
through
the
fan
channels
he
trailed
off
then
with
a
note
of
suspicion
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
ah
no
sense
in
faking
it
perry
and
i
are
going
to
go
into
business
together
making
kinetic
sculptures
like
the
old
days
no
perry
you
two
are
back
together
christ
all
doomed
he
was
laughing
sculptures
like
that
toast
robot
and
he
wants
to
go
into
i
thought
he
was
some
kind
of
commie
lester
had
a
rush
of
remembrance
the
emotional
memory
of
how
much
he
hated
this
man
and
everything
he
stood
for
what
had
happened
to
him
over
the
years
that
he
counted
this
sneak
this
thug
as
his
colleague
what
had
he
sold
when
he
sold
out
perry
gibbons
lester
said
and
drew
in
a
breath
perry
gibbons
is
the
sharpest
entrepreneur
i
ever
met
he
ca
but
make
businesses
he
an
artist
who
anticipates
the
market
a
year
ahead
of
the
curve
he
could
be
a
rich
man
a
hundred
times
over
if
he
chose
commie
page
you
not
fit
to
keep
his
books
the
line
went
quiet
the
eerie
silence
of
a
with
no
packets
routing
on
it
goodbye
lester
sammy
said
at
length
lester
wanted
to
apologize
he
wanted
to
want
to
apologize
he
swallowed
the
apology
and
disconnected
the
line
when
it
was
time
for
bed
suzanne
shut
her
lid
and
put
the
computer
down
beside
the
sofa
she
stepped
carefully
around
the
pieces
of
the
calvinball
game
that
still
covered
the
living
room
floor
and
stepped
into
a
pair
of
slippers
she
slid
open
the
back
door
and
hit
the
switch
for
the
yard
the
last
thing
she
wanted
to
do
was
trip
into
the
pool
she
picked
her
way
carefully
down
the
flagstones
that
led
to
the
workshop
where
the
lights
burned
merrily
in
the
night
there
was
no
moon
tonight
and
the
stars
were
laid
out
like
a
bag
of
synthetic
diamonds
arrayed
on
a
piece
of
black
velour
in
a
street
market
stall
she
peered
through
the
window
before
she
went
around
to
the
door
the
journalist
in
her
wanting
to
fix
an
image
of
the
moment
in
her
mind
before
she
moved
in
and
disturbed
it
that
was
the
problem
with
being
a
reporter
everything
changed
the
instant
you
started
reporting
on
it
by
now
there
was
a
person
alive
who
did
know
what
it
means
to
be
in
the
presence
of
a
reporter
she
was
a
roving
panopticon
the
scene
inside
the
workshop
was
eerie
perry
and
lester
stood
next
to
each
other
cheek
by
jowl
hunched
over
something
on
the
workbench
perry
had
a
computer
open
in
front
of
him
and
he
was
typing
lester
holding
something
out
of
sight
how
many
times
had
she
seen
this
tableau
how
many
afternoons
had
she
spent
in
the
workshop
in
florida
watching
them
hack
a
robot
build
a
sculpture
turn
out
the
latest
toy
for
tjan
amusement
enrichment
the
postures
were
identical
though
their
bodies
had
changed
the
hair
thinner
and
grayer
like
someone
had
frozen
one
of
those
innocent
moments
in
time
for
a
decade
then
retouched
it
with
wizening
makeup
and
she
must
have
made
a
noise
because
lester
looked
up
or
maybe
it
was
just
the
uncanny
bond
between
an
old
married
couple
he
grinned
at
her
like
he
was
ten
years
old
and
she
grinned
back
and
went
around
to
the
door
hello
boys
she
said
they
straightened
up
both
of
them
unconsciously
cradling
their
low
backs
and
she
suppressed
a
grin
little
boys
all
grown
darling
lester
said
come
here
have
a
look
he
put
his
arm
over
her
shoulders
and
walked
her
to
the
bench
leaning
on
her
a
little
it
was
in
pieces
but
she
could
see
where
it
was
going
a
pair
of
familiar
boxy
shapes
two
of
lester
mechanical
computers
their
registers
spilling
away
in
a
long
of
and
rotating
shafts
one
figure
was
big
and
like
a
vintage
refrigerator
the
other
was
cockeyed
half
its
gears
set
higher
than
the
other
half
each
had
a
single
stark
mechanical
arm
extended
before
it
and
at
the
end
of
each
arm
was
a
familiar
cracked
and
fragrant
baseball
glove
lester
put
a
ball
into
one
of
the
gloves
and
perry
hammered
away
at
the
keyboard
very
very
slowly
the
robot
drew
its
mechanical
arm
back
we
used
one
of
the
prosthestic
plans
lester
whispered
in
the
tense
moment
then
it
lobbed
a
soft
underhand
toss
to
the
lopsided
one
the
ball
arced
through
the
air
and
the
other
bot
repositioned
its
arm
in
a
series
of
clattering
jerks
it
seemed
to
suzanne
that
the
ball
would
miss
the
glove
and
bounce
off
of
the
robot
carapace
and
she
winced
then
at
the
very
last
second
the
robot
repositioned
its
arm
with
one
more
fast
jerk
and
the
ball
fell
into
the
pocket
a
moment
later
the
lopsided
bot
perry
it
was
perry
that
was
easy
to
see
tossed
the
ball
to
the
one
who
was
clearly
her
lester
as
she
first
known
him
caught
the
ball
with
a
similar
series
of
jerks
and
returned
the
volley
it
was
magic
to
watch
the
robots
play
their
game
of
catch
suzanne
was
mesmerized
mouth
open
lester
squeezed
her
shoulder
with
uncontained
excitement
the
lobbed
one
to
but
flubbed
the
toss
the
ball
made
a
resounding
gong
sound
as
it
bounced
off
of
carapace
and
wobbled
suzanne
winced
but
lester
and
perry
both
dissolved
in
gales
of
laughter
she
watched
the
try
to
get
itself
aligning
its
torso
to
face
and
she
saw
that
it
funny
very
funny
like
a
particularly
great
cartoon
they
do
that
on
purpose
not
exactly
but
there
no
way
they
going
to
be
perfect
so
we
built
in
a
bunch
of
stuff
that
would
make
it
funnier
when
it
happened
it
is
now
officially
a
feature
not
a
bug
perry
glowed
with
pride
is
it
bad
for
them
to
get
beaned
with
a
baseball
she
asked
as
lester
carefully
handed
the
ball
to
who
lobbed
it
to
again
well
yeah
but
it
kind
of
an
artistic
statement
perry
said
looking
away
from
them
both
about
the
way
that
friendships
always
wear
you
down
like
upper
and
lower
molars
grinding
away
at
each
other
lester
squeezed
her
again
over
time
they
knock
each
other
apart
tears
pricked
at
suzanne
eyes
she
blinked
them
away
guys
this
is
great
her
voice
cracked
but
she
did
care
lester
squeezed
her
tighter
come
to
bed
soon
hon
she
said
to
lester
i
going
away
again
tomorrow
afternoon
new
york
a
restaurant
opening
i
be
right
up
lester
said
and
kissed
the
top
of
her
head
forgotten
that
he
was
that
tall
he
did
stand
all
the
way
up
she
went
to
bed
but
she
could
sleep
she
crossed
to
the
window
and
drew
back
the
curtain
and
looked
out
at
the
backyard
the
scummy
swimming
pool
she
kept
forgetting
to
do
something
about
the
heavy
grapefruit
and
lemon
trees
the
shed
perry
stood
on
the
shed
stoop
looking
up
at
the
night
sky
she
pulled
the
curtains
around
herself
an
instant
before
he
looked
up
at
her
their
eyes
met
and
he
nodded
slowly
thank
you
she
mouthed
silently
he
blew
her
a
kiss
stuck
out
a
foot
and
then
bowed
slightly
over
his
outstretched
leg
she
let
the
curtain
fall
back
into
place
and
went
back
to
bed
lester
climbed
into
bed
with
her
a
few
minutes
later
and
spooned
up
against
her
back
his
face
buried
in
her
neck
she
fell
asleep
almost
instantly
