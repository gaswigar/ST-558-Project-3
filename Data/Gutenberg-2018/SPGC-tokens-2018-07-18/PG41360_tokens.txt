introduction
subject
of
our
study
religious
sociology
and
the
theory
of
knowledge
in
this
book
we
propose
to
study
the
most
primitive
and
simple
religion
which
is
actually
known
to
make
an
analysis
of
it
and
to
attempt
an
explanation
of
it
a
religious
system
may
be
said
to
be
the
most
primitive
which
we
can
observe
when
it
fulfils
the
two
following
conditions
in
the
first
place
when
it
is
found
in
a
society
whose
organization
is
surpassed
by
no
others
in
simplicity
and
secondly
when
it
is
possible
to
explain
it
without
making
use
of
any
element
borrowed
from
a
previous
religion
we
shall
set
ourselves
to
describe
the
organization
of
this
system
with
all
the
exactness
and
fidelity
that
an
ethnographer
or
an
historian
could
give
it
but
our
task
will
not
be
limited
to
that
sociology
raises
other
problems
than
history
or
ethnography
it
does
not
seek
to
know
the
passed
forms
of
civilization
with
the
sole
end
of
knowing
them
and
reconstructing
them
but
rather
like
every
positive
science
it
has
as
its
object
the
explanation
of
some
actual
reality
which
is
near
to
us
and
which
consequently
is
capable
of
affecting
our
ideas
and
our
acts
this
reality
is
man
and
more
precisely
the
man
of
for
there
is
nothing
which
we
are
more
interested
in
knowing
then
we
are
not
going
to
study
a
very
archaic
religion
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
telling
its
peculiarities
and
its
singularities
if
we
have
taken
it
as
the
subject
of
our
research
it
is
because
it
has
seemed
to
us
better
adapted
than
any
other
to
lead
to
an
understanding
of
the
religious
nature
of
man
that
is
to
say
to
show
us
an
essential
and
permanent
aspect
of
humanity
but
this
proposition
is
not
accepted
before
the
raising
of
strong
objections
it
seems
very
strange
that
one
must
turn
back
and
be
transported
to
the
very
beginnings
of
history
in
order
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
humanity
as
it
is
at
present
this
manner
of
procedure
seems
particularly
paradoxical
in
the
question
which
concerns
us
in
fact
the
various
religions
generally
pass
as
being
quite
unequal
in
value
and
dignity
it
is
said
that
they
do
not
all
contain
the
same
quota
of
truth
then
it
seems
as
though
one
could
not
compare
the
highest
forms
of
religious
thought
with
the
lowest
without
reducing
the
first
to
the
level
of
the
second
if
we
admit
that
the
crude
cults
of
the
australian
tribes
can
help
us
to
understand
christianity
for
example
is
that
not
supposing
that
this
latter
religion
proceeds
from
the
same
mentality
as
the
former
that
it
is
made
up
of
the
same
superstitions
and
rests
upon
the
same
errors
this
is
how
the
theoretical
importance
which
has
sometimes
been
attributed
to
primitive
religions
has
come
to
pass
as
a
sign
of
a
systematic
hostility
to
all
religion
which
by
prejudging
the
results
of
the
study
vitiates
them
in
advance
there
is
no
occasion
for
asking
here
whether
or
not
there
are
scholars
who
have
merited
this
reproach
and
who
have
made
religious
history
and
ethnology
a
weapon
against
religion
in
any
case
a
sociologist
can
not
hold
such
a
point
of
view
in
fact
it
is
an
essential
postulate
of
sociology
that
a
human
institution
can
not
rest
upon
an
error
and
a
lie
without
which
it
could
not
exist
if
it
were
not
founded
in
the
nature
of
things
it
would
have
encountered
in
the
facts
a
resistance
over
which
it
could
never
have
triumphed
so
when
we
commence
the
study
of
primitive
religions
it
is
with
the
assurance
that
they
hold
to
reality
and
express
it
this
principle
will
be
seen
to
again
and
again
in
the
course
of
the
analyses
and
discussions
which
follow
and
the
reproach
which
we
make
against
the
schools
from
which
we
have
separated
ourselves
is
that
they
have
ignored
it
when
only
the
letter
of
the
formulæ
is
considered
these
religious
beliefs
and
practices
undoubtedly
seem
disconcerting
at
times
and
one
is
tempted
to
attribute
them
to
some
sort
of
a
error
but
one
must
know
how
to
go
underneath
the
symbol
to
the
reality
which
it
represents
and
which
gives
it
its
meaning
the
most
barbarous
and
the
most
fantastic
rites
and
the
strangest
myths
translate
some
human
need
some
aspect
of
life
either
individual
or
social
the
reasons
with
which
the
faithful
justify
them
may
be
and
generally
are
erroneous
but
the
true
reasons
do
not
cease
to
exist
and
it
is
the
duty
of
science
to
discover
them
in
reality
then
there
are
no
religions
which
are
false
all
are
true
in
their
own
fashion
all
answer
though
in
different
ways
to
the
given
conditions
of
human
existence
it
is
undeniably
possible
to
arrange
them
in
a
hierarchy
some
can
be
called
superior
to
others
in
the
sense
that
they
call
into
play
higher
mental
functions
that
they
are
richer
in
ideas
and
sentiments
that
they
contain
more
concepts
with
fewer
sensations
and
images
and
that
their
arrangement
is
wiser
but
howsoever
real
this
greater
complexity
and
this
higher
ideality
may
be
they
are
not
sufficient
to
place
the
corresponding
religions
in
different
classes
all
are
religions
equally
just
as
all
living
beings
are
equally
alive
from
the
most
humble
plastids
up
to
man
so
when
we
turn
to
primitive
religions
it
is
not
with
the
idea
of
depreciating
religion
in
general
for
these
religions
are
no
less
respectable
than
the
others
they
respond
to
the
same
needs
they
play
the
same
rôle
they
depend
upon
the
same
causes
they
can
also
well
serve
to
show
the
nature
of
the
religious
life
and
consequently
to
resolve
the
problem
which
we
wish
to
study
but
why
give
them
a
sort
of
prerogative
why
choose
them
in
preference
to
all
others
as
the
subject
of
our
study
it
is
merely
for
reasons
of
method
in
the
first
place
we
can
not
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
the
most
recent
religions
except
by
following
the
manner
in
which
they
have
been
progressively
composed
in
history
in
fact
historical
analysis
is
the
only
means
of
explanation
which
it
is
possible
to
apply
to
them
it
alone
enables
us
to
resolve
an
institution
into
its
constituent
elements
for
it
shows
them
to
us
as
they
are
born
in
time
one
after
another
on
the
other
hand
by
placing
every
one
of
them
in
the
condition
where
it
was
born
it
puts
into
our
hands
the
only
means
we
have
of
determining
the
causes
which
gave
rise
to
it
every
time
that
we
undertake
to
explain
something
human
taken
at
a
given
moment
in
history
be
it
a
religious
belief
a
moral
precept
a
legal
principle
an
æsthetic
style
or
an
economic
system
it
is
necessary
to
commence
by
going
back
to
its
most
primitive
and
simple
form
to
try
to
account
for
the
characteristics
by
which
it
was
marked
at
that
time
and
then
to
show
how
it
developed
and
became
complicated
little
by
little
and
how
it
became
that
which
it
is
at
the
moment
in
question
one
readily
understands
the
importance
which
the
determination
of
the
point
of
departure
has
for
this
series
of
progressive
explanations
for
all
the
others
are
attached
to
it
it
was
one
of
descartes
principles
that
the
first
ring
has
a
predominating
place
in
the
chain
of
scientific
truths
but
there
is
no
question
of
placing
at
the
foundation
of
the
science
of
religions
an
idea
elaborated
after
the
cartesian
manner
that
is
to
say
a
logical
concept
a
pure
possibility
constructed
simply
by
force
of
thought
what
we
must
find
is
a
concrete
reality
and
historical
and
ethnological
observation
alone
can
reveal
that
to
us
but
even
if
this
cardinal
conception
is
obtained
by
a
different
process
than
that
of
descartes
it
remains
true
that
it
is
destined
to
have
a
considerable
influence
on
the
whole
series
of
propositions
which
the
science
establishes
biological
evolution
has
been
conceived
quite
differently
ever
since
it
has
been
known
that
monocellular
beings
do
exist
in
the
same
way
the
arrangement
of
religious
facts
is
explained
quite
differently
according
as
we
put
naturism
animism
or
some
other
religious
form
at
the
beginning
of
the
evolution
even
the
most
specialized
scholars
if
they
are
unwilling
to
confine
themselves
to
a
task
of
pure
erudition
and
if
they
desire
to
interpret
the
facts
which
they
analyse
are
obliged
to
choose
one
of
these
hypotheses
and
make
it
their
whether
they
desire
it
or
not
the
questions
which
they
raise
necessarily
take
the
following
form
how
has
naturism
or
animism
been
led
to
take
this
particular
form
here
or
there
or
to
enrich
itself
or
impoverish
itself
in
such
and
such
a
fashion
since
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
taking
sides
on
this
initial
problem
and
since
the
solution
given
is
destined
to
affect
the
whole
science
it
must
be
attacked
at
the
outset
that
is
what
we
propose
to
do
besides
this
outside
of
these
indirect
reactions
the
study
of
primitive
religions
has
of
itself
an
immediate
interest
which
is
of
primary
importance
if
it
is
useful
to
know
what
a
certain
particular
religion
consists
in
it
is
still
more
important
to
know
what
religion
in
general
is
this
is
the
problem
which
has
aroused
the
interest
of
philosophers
in
all
times
and
not
without
reason
for
it
is
of
interest
to
all
humanity
unfortunately
the
method
which
they
generally
employ
is
purely
dialectic
they
confine
themselves
to
analysing
the
idea
which
they
make
for
themselves
of
religion
except
as
they
illustrate
the
results
of
this
mental
analysis
by
examples
borrowed
from
the
religions
which
best
realize
their
ideal
but
even
if
this
method
ought
to
be
abandoned
the
problem
remains
intact
and
the
great
service
of
philosophy
is
to
have
prevented
its
being
suppressed
by
the
disdain
of
scholars
now
it
is
possible
to
attack
it
in
a
different
way
since
all
religions
can
be
compared
to
each
other
and
since
all
are
species
of
the
same
class
there
are
necessarily
many
elements
which
are
common
to
all
we
do
not
mean
to
speak
simply
of
the
outward
and
visible
characteristics
which
they
all
have
equally
and
which
make
it
possible
to
give
them
a
provisional
definition
from
the
very
outset
of
our
researches
the
discovery
of
these
apparent
signs
is
relatively
easy
for
the
observation
which
it
demands
does
not
go
beneath
the
surface
of
things
but
these
external
resemblances
suppose
others
which
are
profound
at
the
foundation
of
all
systems
of
beliefs
and
of
all
cults
there
ought
necessarily
to
be
a
certain
number
of
fundamental
representations
or
conceptions
and
of
ritual
attitudes
which
in
spite
of
the
diversity
of
forms
which
they
have
taken
have
the
same
objective
significance
and
fulfil
the
same
functions
everywhere
these
are
the
permanent
elements
which
constitute
that
which
is
permanent
and
human
in
religion
they
form
all
the
objective
contents
of
the
idea
which
is
expressed
when
one
speaks
of
in
general
how
is
it
possible
to
pick
them
out
surely
it
is
not
by
observing
the
complex
religions
which
appear
in
the
course
of
history
every
one
of
these
is
made
up
of
such
a
variety
of
elements
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
what
is
secondary
from
what
is
principal
the
essential
from
the
accessory
suppose
that
the
religion
considered
is
like
that
of
egypt
india
or
the
classical
antiquity
it
is
a
confused
mass
of
many
cults
varying
according
to
the
locality
the
temples
the
generations
the
dynasties
the
invasions
etc
popular
superstitions
are
there
confused
with
the
purest
dogmas
neither
the
thought
nor
the
activity
of
the
religion
is
evenly
distributed
among
the
believers
according
to
the
men
the
environment
and
the
circumstances
the
beliefs
as
well
as
the
rites
are
thought
of
in
different
ways
here
they
are
priests
there
they
are
monks
elsewhere
they
are
laymen
there
are
mystics
and
rationalists
theologians
and
prophets
etc
in
these
conditions
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
is
common
to
all
in
one
or
another
of
these
systems
it
is
quite
possible
to
find
the
means
of
making
a
profitable
study
of
some
particular
fact
which
is
specially
developed
there
such
as
sacrifice
or
prophecy
monasticism
or
the
mysteries
but
how
is
it
possible
to
find
the
common
foundation
of
the
religious
life
underneath
the
luxuriant
vegetation
which
covers
it
how
is
it
possible
to
find
underneath
the
disputes
of
theology
the
variations
of
ritual
the
multiplicity
of
groups
and
the
diversity
of
individuals
the
fundamental
states
characteristic
of
religious
mentality
in
general
things
are
quite
different
in
the
lower
societies
the
slighter
development
of
individuality
the
small
extension
of
the
group
the
homogeneity
of
external
circumstances
all
contribute
to
reducing
the
differences
and
variations
to
a
minimum
the
group
has
an
intellectual
and
moral
conformity
of
which
we
find
but
rare
examples
in
the
more
advanced
societies
everything
is
common
to
all
movements
are
stereotyped
everybody
performs
the
same
ones
in
the
same
circumstances
and
this
conformity
of
conduct
only
translates
the
conformity
of
thought
every
mind
being
drawn
into
the
same
eddy
the
individual
type
nearly
confounds
itself
with
that
of
the
race
and
while
all
is
uniform
all
is
simple
as
well
nothing
is
deformed
like
these
myths
all
composed
of
one
and
the
same
theme
which
is
endlessly
repeated
or
like
these
rites
made
up
of
a
small
number
of
gestures
repeated
again
and
again
neither
the
popular
imagination
nor
that
of
the
priests
has
had
either
the
time
or
the
means
of
refining
and
transforming
the
original
substance
of
the
religious
ideas
and
practices
these
are
shown
in
all
their
nudity
and
offer
themselves
to
an
examination
it
requiring
only
the
slightest
effort
to
lay
them
open
that
which
is
accessory
or
secondary
the
development
of
luxury
has
not
yet
come
to
hide
the
principal
elements
all
is
reduced
to
that
which
is
indispensable
to
that
without
which
there
could
be
no
religion
but
that
which
is
indispensable
is
also
that
which
is
essential
that
is
to
say
that
which
we
must
know
before
all
else
primitive
civilizations
offer
privileged
cases
then
because
they
are
simple
cases
that
is
why
in
all
fields
of
human
activity
the
observations
of
ethnologists
have
frequently
been
veritable
revelations
which
have
renewed
the
study
of
human
institutions
for
example
before
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
everybody
was
convinced
that
the
father
was
the
essential
element
of
the
family
no
one
had
dreamed
that
there
could
be
a
family
organization
of
which
the
paternal
authority
was
not
the
keystone
but
the
discovery
of
bachofen
came
and
upset
this
old
conception
up
to
very
recent
times
it
was
regarded
as
evident
that
the
moral
and
legal
relations
of
kindred
were
only
another
aspect
of
the
psychological
relations
which
result
from
a
common
descent
bachofen
and
his
successors
maclennan
morgan
and
many
others
still
laboured
under
this
misunderstanding
but
since
we
have
become
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
primitive
clan
we
know
that
on
the
contrary
relationships
can
not
be
explained
by
consanguinity
to
return
to
religions
the
study
of
only
the
most
familiar
ones
had
led
men
to
believe
for
a
long
time
that
the
idea
of
god
was
characteristic
of
everything
that
is
religious
now
the
religion
which
we
are
going
to
study
presently
is
in
a
large
part
foreign
to
all
idea
of
divinity
the
forces
to
which
the
rites
are
there
addressed
are
very
different
from
those
which
occupy
the
leading
place
in
our
modern
religions
yet
they
aid
us
in
understanding
these
latter
forces
so
nothing
is
more
unjust
than
the
disdain
with
which
too
many
historians
still
regard
the
work
of
ethnographers
indeed
it
is
certain
that
ethnology
has
frequently
brought
about
the
most
fruitful
revolutions
in
the
different
branches
of
sociology
it
is
for
this
same
reason
that
the
discovery
of
unicellular
beings
of
which
we
just
spoke
has
transformed
the
current
idea
of
life
since
in
these
very
simple
beings
life
is
reduced
to
its
essential
traits
these
are
less
easily
misunderstood
but
primitive
religions
do
not
merely
aid
us
in
disengaging
the
constituent
elements
of
religion
they
also
have
the
great
advantage
that
they
facilitate
the
explanation
of
it
since
the
facts
there
are
simpler
the
relations
between
them
are
more
apparent
the
reasons
with
which
men
account
for
their
acts
have
not
yet
been
elaborated
and
denatured
by
studied
reflection
they
are
nearer
and
more
closely
related
to
the
motives
which
have
really
determined
these
acts
in
order
to
understand
an
hallucination
perfectly
and
give
it
its
most
appropriate
treatment
a
physician
must
know
its
original
point
of
departure
now
this
event
is
proportionately
easier
to
find
if
he
can
observe
it
near
its
beginnings
the
longer
the
disease
is
allowed
to
develop
the
more
it
evades
observation
that
is
because
all
sorts
of
interpretations
have
intervened
as
it
advanced
which
tend
to
force
the
original
state
into
the
background
and
across
which
it
is
frequently
difficult
to
find
the
initial
one
between
a
systematized
hallucination
and
the
first
impressions
which
gave
it
birth
the
distance
is
often
considerable
it
is
the
same
thing
with
religious
thought
in
proportion
as
it
progresses
in
history
the
causes
which
called
it
into
existence
though
remaining
active
are
no
longer
perceived
except
across
a
vast
scheme
of
interpretations
which
quite
transform
them
popular
mythologies
and
subtile
theologies
have
done
their
work
they
have
superimposed
upon
the
primitive
sentiments
others
which
are
quite
different
and
which
though
holding
to
the
first
of
which
they
are
an
elaborated
form
only
allow
their
true
nature
to
appear
very
imperfectly
the
psychological
gap
between
the
cause
and
the
effect
between
the
apparent
cause
and
the
effective
cause
has
become
more
considerable
and
more
difficult
for
the
mind
to
leap
the
remainder
of
this
book
will
be
an
illustration
and
a
verification
of
this
remark
on
method
it
will
be
seen
how
in
the
primitive
religions
the
religious
fact
still
visibly
carries
the
mark
of
its
origins
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
infer
them
merely
from
the
study
of
the
more
developed
religions
the
study
which
we
are
undertaking
is
therefore
a
way
of
taking
up
again
under
new
the
old
problem
of
the
origin
of
religion
to
be
sure
if
by
origin
we
are
to
understand
the
very
first
beginning
the
question
has
nothing
scientific
about
it
and
should
be
resolutely
discarded
there
was
no
given
moment
when
religion
began
to
exist
and
there
is
consequently
no
need
of
finding
a
means
of
transporting
ourselves
thither
in
thought
like
every
human
institution
religion
did
not
commence
anywhere
therefore
all
speculations
of
this
sort
are
justly
discredited
they
can
only
consist
in
subjective
and
arbitrary
constructions
which
are
subject
to
no
sort
of
control
but
the
problem
which
we
raise
is
quite
another
one
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
find
a
means
of
discerning
the
causes
upon
which
the
most
essential
forms
of
religious
thought
and
practice
depend
now
for
the
reasons
which
were
just
set
forth
these
causes
are
proportionately
more
easily
observable
as
the
societies
where
they
are
observed
are
less
complicated
that
is
why
we
try
to
get
as
near
as
possible
to
the
origins
it
is
not
that
we
ascribe
particular
virtues
to
the
lower
religions
on
the
contrary
they
are
rudimentary
and
gross
we
can
not
make
of
them
a
sort
of
model
which
later
religions
only
have
to
reproduce
but
even
their
grossness
makes
them
instructive
for
they
thus
become
convenient
for
experiments
as
in
them
the
facts
and
their
relations
are
easily
seen
in
order
to
discover
the
laws
of
the
phenomena
which
he
studies
the
physicist
tries
to
simplify
these
latter
and
rid
them
of
their
secondary
characteristics
for
that
which
concerns
institutions
nature
spontaneously
makes
the
same
sort
of
simplifications
at
the
beginning
of
history
we
merely
wish
to
put
these
to
profit
undoubtedly
we
can
only
touch
very
elementary
facts
by
this
method
when
we
shall
have
accounted
for
them
as
far
as
possible
the
novelties
of
every
sort
which
have
been
produced
in
the
course
of
evolution
will
not
yet
be
explained
but
while
we
do
not
dream
of
denying
the
importance
of
the
problems
thus
raised
we
think
that
they
will
profit
by
being
treated
in
their
turn
and
that
it
is
important
to
take
them
up
only
after
those
of
which
we
are
going
to
undertake
the
study
at
present
ii
but
our
study
is
not
of
interest
merely
for
the
science
of
religion
in
fact
every
religion
has
one
side
by
which
it
overlaps
the
circle
of
properly
religious
ideas
and
there
the
study
of
religious
phenomena
gives
a
means
of
renewing
the
problems
which
up
to
the
present
have
only
been
discussed
among
philosophers
for
a
long
time
it
has
been
known
that
the
first
systems
of
representations
with
which
men
have
pictured
to
themselves
the
world
and
themselves
were
of
religious
origin
there
is
no
religion
that
is
not
a
cosmology
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
a
speculation
upon
divine
things
if
philosophy
and
the
sciences
were
born
of
religion
it
is
because
religion
began
by
taking
the
place
of
the
sciences
and
philosophy
but
it
has
been
less
frequently
noticed
that
religion
has
not
confined
itself
to
enriching
the
human
intellect
formed
beforehand
with
a
certain
number
of
ideas
it
has
contributed
to
forming
the
intellect
itself
men
owe
to
it
not
only
a
good
part
of
the
substance
of
their
knowledge
but
also
the
form
in
which
this
knowledge
has
been
elaborated
at
the
roots
of
all
our
judgments
there
are
a
certain
number
of
essential
ideas
which
dominate
all
our
intellectual
life
they
are
what
philosophers
since
aristotle
have
called
the
categories
of
the
understanding
ideas
of
time
space
class
number
cause
substance
personality
etc
they
correspond
to
the
most
universal
properties
of
things
they
are
like
the
solid
frame
which
encloses
all
thought
this
does
not
seem
to
be
able
to
liberate
itself
from
them
without
destroying
itself
for
it
seems
that
we
can
not
think
of
objects
that
are
not
in
time
and
space
which
have
no
number
etc
other
ideas
are
contingent
and
unsteady
we
can
conceive
of
their
being
unknown
to
a
man
a
society
or
an
epoch
but
these
others
appear
to
be
nearly
inseparable
from
the
normal
working
of
the
intellect
they
are
like
the
framework
of
the
intelligence
now
when
primitive
religious
beliefs
are
systematically
analysed
the
principal
categories
are
naturally
found
they
are
born
in
religion
and
of
religion
they
are
a
product
of
religious
thought
this
is
a
statement
that
we
are
going
to
have
occasion
to
make
many
times
in
the
course
of
this
work
this
remark
has
some
interest
of
itself
already
but
here
is
what
gives
it
its
real
importance
the
general
conclusion
of
the
book
which
the
reader
has
before
him
is
that
religion
is
something
eminently
social
religious
representations
are
collective
representations
which
express
collective
realities
the
rites
are
a
manner
of
acting
which
take
rise
in
the
midst
of
the
assembled
groups
and
which
are
destined
to
excite
maintain
or
recreate
certain
mental
states
in
these
groups
so
if
the
categories
are
of
religious
origin
they
ought
to
participate
in
this
nature
common
to
all
religious
facts
they
too
should
be
social
affairs
and
the
product
of
collective
thought
at
least
for
in
the
actual
condition
of
our
knowledge
of
these
matters
one
should
be
careful
to
avoid
all
radical
and
exclusive
statements
it
is
allowable
to
suppose
that
they
are
rich
in
social
elements
even
at
present
these
can
be
imperfectly
seen
in
some
of
them
for
example
try
to
represent
what
the
notion
of
time
would
be
without
the
processes
by
which
we
divide
it
measure
it
or
express
it
with
objective
signs
a
time
which
is
not
a
succession
of
years
months
weeks
days
and
hours
this
is
something
nearly
unthinkable
we
can
not
conceive
of
time
except
on
condition
of
distinguishing
its
different
moments
now
what
is
the
origin
of
this
differentiation
undoubtedly
the
states
of
consciousness
which
we
have
already
experienced
can
be
reproduced
in
us
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
passed
in
the
first
place
thus
portions
of
our
past
become
present
again
though
being
clearly
distinguished
from
the
present
but
howsoever
important
this
distinction
may
be
for
our
private
experience
it
is
far
from
being
enough
to
constitute
the
notion
or
category
of
time
this
does
not
consist
merely
in
a
commemoration
either
partial
or
integral
of
our
past
life
it
is
an
abstract
and
impersonal
frame
which
surrounds
not
only
our
individual
existence
but
that
of
all
humanity
it
is
like
an
endless
chart
where
all
duration
is
spread
out
before
the
mind
and
upon
which
all
possible
events
can
be
located
in
relation
to
fixed
and
determined
guide
lines
it
is
not
that
is
thus
arranged
it
is
time
in
general
such
as
it
is
objectively
thought
of
by
everybody
in
a
single
civilization
that
alone
is
enough
to
give
us
a
hint
that
such
an
arrangement
ought
to
be
collective
and
in
reality
observation
proves
that
these
indispensable
guide
lines
in
relation
to
which
all
things
are
temporally
located
are
taken
from
social
life
the
divisions
into
days
weeks
months
years
correspond
to
the
periodical
recurrence
of
rites
feasts
and
public
ceremonies
a
calendar
expresses
the
rhythm
of
the
collective
activities
while
at
the
same
time
its
function
is
to
assure
their
regularity
it
is
the
same
thing
with
space
as
hamelin
has
shown
space
is
not
the
vague
and
indetermined
medium
which
kant
imagined
if
purely
and
absolutely
homogeneous
it
would
be
of
no
use
and
could
not
be
grasped
by
the
mind
spatial
representation
consists
essentially
in
a
primary
of
the
data
of
sensuous
experience
but
this
would
be
impossible
if
the
parts
of
space
were
qualitatively
equivalent
and
if
they
were
really
interchangeable
to
dispose
things
spatially
there
must
be
a
possibility
of
placing
them
differently
of
putting
some
at
the
right
others
at
the
left
these
above
those
below
at
the
north
of
or
at
the
south
of
east
or
west
of
just
as
to
dispose
states
of
consciousness
temporally
there
must
be
a
possibility
of
localizing
them
at
determined
dates
that
is
to
say
that
space
could
not
be
what
it
is
if
it
were
not
like
time
divided
and
differentiated
but
whence
come
these
divisions
which
are
so
essential
by
themselves
there
are
neither
right
nor
left
up
nor
down
north
nor
south
etc
all
these
distinctions
evidently
come
from
the
fact
that
different
sympathetic
values
have
been
attributed
to
various
regions
since
all
the
men
of
a
single
civilization
represent
space
in
the
same
way
it
is
clearly
necessary
that
these
sympathetic
values
and
the
distinctions
which
depend
upon
them
should
be
equally
universal
and
that
almost
necessarily
implies
that
they
be
of
social
origin
besides
that
there
are
cases
where
this
social
character
is
made
manifest
there
are
societies
in
australia
and
north
america
where
space
is
conceived
in
the
form
of
an
immense
circle
because
the
camp
has
a
circular
form
and
this
spatial
circle
is
divided
up
exactly
like
the
tribal
circle
and
is
in
its
image
there
are
as
many
regions
distinguished
as
there
are
clans
in
the
tribe
and
it
is
the
place
occupied
by
the
clans
inside
the
encampment
which
has
determined
the
orientation
of
these
regions
each
region
is
defined
by
the
totem
of
the
clan
to
which
it
is
assigned
among
the
zuñi
for
example
the
pueblo
contains
seven
quarters
each
of
these
is
a
group
of
clans
which
has
had
a
unity
in
all
probability
it
was
originally
a
single
clan
which
was
later
subdivided
now
their
space
also
contains
seven
quarters
and
each
of
these
seven
quarters
of
the
world
is
in
intimate
connection
with
a
quarter
of
the
pueblo
that
is
to
say
with
a
group
of
clans
thus
says
cushing
one
division
is
thought
to
be
in
relation
with
the
north
another
represents
the
west
another
the
south
etc
each
quarter
of
the
pueblo
has
its
characteristic
colour
which
symbolizes
it
each
region
has
its
colour
which
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
the
corresponding
quarter
in
the
course
of
history
the
number
of
fundamental
clans
has
varied
the
number
of
the
fundamental
regions
of
space
has
varied
with
them
thus
the
social
organization
has
been
the
model
for
the
spatial
organization
and
a
reproduction
of
it
it
is
thus
even
up
to
the
distinction
between
right
and
left
which
far
from
being
inherent
in
the
nature
of
man
in
general
is
very
probably
the
product
of
representations
which
are
religious
and
therefore
collective
analogous
proofs
will
be
found
presently
in
regard
to
the
ideas
of
class
force
personality
and
efficacy
it
is
even
possible
to
ask
if
the
idea
of
contradiction
does
not
also
depend
upon
social
conditions
what
makes
one
tend
to
believe
this
is
that
the
empire
which
the
idea
has
exercised
over
human
thought
has
varied
with
times
and
societies
the
principle
of
identity
dominates
scientific
thought
but
there
are
vast
systems
of
representations
which
have
played
a
considerable
rôle
in
the
history
of
ideas
where
it
has
frequently
been
set
aside
these
are
the
mythologies
from
the
grossest
up
to
the
most
reasonable
there
we
are
continually
coming
upon
beings
which
have
the
most
contradictory
attributes
simultaneously
who
are
at
the
same
time
one
and
many
material
and
spiritual
who
can
divide
themselves
up
indefinitely
without
losing
anything
of
their
constitution
in
mythology
it
is
an
axiom
that
the
part
is
worth
the
whole
these
variations
through
which
the
rules
which
seem
to
govern
our
present
logic
have
passed
prove
that
far
from
being
engraven
through
all
eternity
upon
the
mental
constitution
of
men
they
depend
at
least
in
part
upon
factors
that
are
historical
and
consequently
social
we
do
not
know
exactly
what
they
are
but
we
may
presume
that
they
exist
this
hypothesis
once
admitted
the
problem
of
knowledge
is
posed
in
new
terms
up
to
the
present
there
have
been
only
two
doctrines
in
the
field
for
some
the
categories
can
not
be
derived
from
experience
they
are
logically
prior
to
it
and
condition
it
they
are
represented
as
so
many
simple
and
irreducible
data
imminent
in
the
human
mind
by
virtue
of
its
inborn
constitution
for
this
reason
they
are
said
to
be
others
however
hold
that
they
are
constructed
and
made
up
of
pieces
and
bits
and
that
the
individual
is
the
artisan
of
this
construction
but
each
solution
raises
grave
difficulties
is
the
empirical
thesis
the
one
adopted
then
it
is
necessary
to
deprive
the
categories
of
all
their
characteristic
properties
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
distinguished
from
all
other
knowledge
by
their
universality
and
necessity
they
are
the
most
general
concepts
which
exist
because
they
are
applicable
to
all
that
is
real
and
since
they
are
not
attached
to
any
particular
object
they
are
independent
of
every
particular
subject
they
constitute
the
common
field
where
all
minds
meet
further
they
must
meet
there
for
reason
which
is
nothing
more
than
all
the
fundamental
categories
taken
together
is
invested
with
an
authority
which
we
could
not
set
aside
if
we
would
when
we
attempt
to
revolt
against
it
and
to
free
ourselves
from
some
of
these
essential
ideas
we
meet
with
great
resistances
they
do
not
merely
depend
upon
us
but
they
impose
themselves
upon
us
now
empirical
data
present
characteristics
which
are
diametrically
opposed
to
these
a
sensation
or
an
image
always
relies
upon
a
determined
object
or
upon
a
collection
of
objects
of
the
same
sort
and
expresses
the
momentary
condition
of
a
particular
consciousness
it
is
essentially
individual
and
subjective
we
therefore
have
considerable
liberty
in
dealing
with
the
representations
of
such
an
origin
it
is
true
that
when
our
sensations
are
actual
they
impose
themselves
upon
us
but
we
are
free
to
conceive
them
otherwise
than
they
really
are
or
to
represent
them
to
ourselves
as
occurring
in
a
different
order
from
that
where
they
are
really
produced
in
regard
to
them
nothing
is
forced
upon
us
except
as
considerations
of
another
sort
intervene
thus
we
find
that
we
have
here
two
sorts
of
knowledge
which
are
like
the
two
opposite
poles
of
the
intelligence
under
these
conditions
forcing
reason
back
upon
experience
causes
it
to
disappear
for
it
is
equivalent
to
reducing
the
universality
and
necessity
which
characterize
it
to
pure
appearance
to
an
illusion
which
may
be
useful
practically
but
which
corresponds
to
nothing
in
reality
consequently
it
is
denying
all
objective
reality
to
the
logical
life
whose
regulation
and
organization
is
the
function
of
the
categories
classical
empiricism
results
in
irrationalism
perhaps
it
would
even
be
fitting
to
designate
it
by
this
latter
name
in
spite
of
the
sense
ordinarily
attached
to
the
name
the
apriorists
have
more
respect
for
the
facts
since
they
do
not
admit
it
as
a
truth
established
by
evidence
that
the
categories
are
made
up
of
the
same
elements
as
our
sensual
representations
they
are
not
obliged
to
impoverish
them
systematically
to
draw
from
them
all
their
real
content
and
to
reduce
them
to
nothing
more
than
verbal
artifices
on
the
contrary
they
leave
them
all
their
specific
characteristics
the
apriorists
are
the
rationalists
they
believe
that
the
world
has
a
logical
aspect
which
the
reason
expresses
excellently
but
for
all
that
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
give
the
mind
a
certain
power
of
transcending
experience
and
of
adding
to
that
which
is
given
to
it
directly
and
of
this
singular
power
they
give
neither
explanation
nor
justification
for
it
is
no
explanation
to
say
that
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
human
intellect
it
is
necessary
to
show
whence
we
hold
this
surprising
prerogative
and
how
it
comes
that
we
can
see
certain
relations
in
things
which
the
examination
of
these
things
can
not
reveal
to
us
saying
that
only
on
this
condition
is
experience
itself
possible
changes
the
problem
perhaps
but
does
not
answer
it
for
the
real
question
is
to
know
how
it
comes
that
experience
is
not
sufficient
unto
itself
but
presupposes
certain
conditions
which
are
exterior
and
prior
to
it
and
how
it
happens
that
these
conditions
are
realized
at
the
moment
and
in
the
manner
that
is
desirable
to
answer
these
questions
it
has
sometimes
been
assumed
that
above
the
reason
of
individuals
there
is
a
superior
and
perfect
reason
from
which
the
others
emanate
and
from
which
they
get
this
marvellous
power
of
theirs
by
a
sort
of
mystic
participation
this
is
the
divine
reason
but
this
hypothesis
has
at
least
the
one
grave
disadvantage
of
being
deprived
of
all
experimental
control
thus
it
does
not
satisfy
the
conditions
demanded
of
a
scientific
hypothesis
more
than
that
the
categories
of
human
thought
are
never
fixed
in
any
one
definite
form
they
are
made
unmade
and
remade
incessantly
they
change
with
places
and
times
on
the
other
hand
the
divine
reason
is
immutable
how
can
this
immutability
give
rise
to
this
incessant
variability
such
are
the
two
conceptions
that
have
been
pitted
against
each
other
for
centuries
and
if
this
debate
seems
to
be
eternal
it
is
because
the
arguments
given
are
really
about
equivalent
if
reason
is
only
a
form
of
individual
experience
it
no
longer
exists
on
the
other
hand
if
the
powers
which
it
has
are
recognized
but
not
accounted
for
it
seems
to
be
set
outside
the
confines
of
nature
and
science
in
the
face
of
these
two
opposed
objections
the
mind
remains
uncertain
but
if
the
social
origin
of
the
categories
is
admitted
a
new
attitude
becomes
possible
which
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
escape
both
of
the
opposed
difficulties
the
fundamental
proposition
of
the
apriorist
theory
is
that
knowledge
is
made
up
of
two
sorts
of
elements
which
can
not
be
reduced
into
one
another
and
which
are
like
two
distinct
layers
superimposed
one
upon
the
other
our
hypothesis
keeps
this
principle
intact
in
fact
that
knowledge
which
is
called
empirical
the
only
knowledge
of
which
the
theorists
of
empiricism
have
made
use
in
constructing
the
reason
is
that
which
is
brought
into
our
minds
by
the
direct
action
of
objects
it
is
composed
of
individual
states
which
are
completely
explained
by
the
psychical
nature
of
the
individual
if
on
the
other
hand
the
categories
are
as
we
believe
they
are
essentially
collective
representations
before
all
else
they
should
show
the
mental
states
of
the
group
they
should
depend
upon
the
way
in
which
this
is
founded
and
organized
upon
its
morphology
upon
its
religious
moral
and
economic
institutions
etc
so
between
these
two
sorts
of
representations
there
is
all
the
difference
which
exists
between
the
individual
and
the
social
and
one
can
no
more
derive
the
second
from
the
first
than
he
can
deduce
society
from
the
individual
the
whole
from
the
part
the
complex
from
the
simple
society
is
a
reality
it
has
its
own
peculiar
characteristics
which
are
not
found
elsewhere
and
which
are
not
met
with
again
in
the
same
form
in
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
the
representations
which
express
it
have
a
wholly
different
contents
from
purely
individual
ones
and
we
may
rest
assured
in
advance
that
the
first
add
something
to
the
second
even
the
manner
in
which
the
two
are
formed
results
in
differentiating
them
collective
representations
are
the
result
of
an
immense
which
stretches
out
not
only
into
space
but
into
time
as
well
to
make
them
a
multitude
of
minds
have
associated
united
and
combined
their
ideas
and
sentiments
for
them
long
generations
have
accumulated
their
experience
and
their
knowledge
a
special
intellectual
activity
is
therefore
concentrated
in
them
which
is
infinitely
richer
and
complexer
than
that
of
the
individual
from
that
one
can
understand
how
the
reason
has
been
able
to
go
beyond
the
limits
of
empirical
knowledge
it
does
not
owe
this
to
any
vague
mysterious
virtue
but
simply
to
the
fact
that
according
to
the
formula
man
is
double
there
are
two
beings
in
him
an
individual
being
which
has
its
foundation
in
the
organism
and
the
circle
of
whose
activities
is
therefore
strictly
limited
and
a
social
being
which
represents
the
highest
reality
in
the
intellectual
and
moral
order
that
we
can
know
by
observation
i
mean
society
this
duality
of
our
nature
has
as
its
consequence
in
the
practical
order
the
irreducibility
of
a
moral
ideal
to
a
utilitarian
motive
and
in
the
order
of
thought
the
irreducibility
of
reason
to
individual
experience
in
so
far
as
he
belongs
to
society
the
individual
transcends
himself
both
when
he
thinks
and
when
he
acts
this
same
social
character
leads
to
an
understanding
of
the
origin
of
the
necessity
of
the
categories
it
is
said
that
an
idea
is
necessary
when
it
imposes
itself
upon
the
mind
by
some
sort
of
virtue
of
its
own
without
being
accompanied
by
any
proof
it
contains
within
it
something
which
constrains
the
intelligence
and
which
leads
to
its
acceptance
without
preliminary
examination
the
apriorist
postulates
this
singular
quality
but
does
not
account
for
it
for
saying
that
the
categories
are
necessary
because
they
are
indispensable
to
the
functioning
of
the
intellect
is
simply
repeating
that
they
are
necessary
but
if
they
really
have
the
origin
which
we
attribute
to
them
their
ascendancy
no
longer
has
anything
surprising
in
it
they
represent
the
most
general
relations
which
exist
between
things
surpassing
all
our
other
ideas
in
extension
they
dominate
all
the
details
of
our
intellectual
life
if
men
did
not
agree
upon
these
essential
ideas
at
every
moment
if
they
did
not
have
the
same
conception
of
time
space
cause
number
all
contact
between
their
minds
would
be
impossible
and
with
that
all
life
together
thus
society
could
not
abandon
the
categories
to
the
free
choice
of
the
individual
without
abandoning
itself
if
it
is
to
live
there
is
not
merely
need
of
a
satisfactory
moral
conformity
but
also
there
is
a
minimum
of
logical
conformity
beyond
which
it
can
not
safely
go
for
this
reason
it
uses
all
its
authority
upon
its
members
to
forestall
such
dissidences
does
a
mind
ostensibly
free
itself
from
these
forms
of
thought
it
is
no
longer
considered
a
human
mind
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
and
is
treated
accordingly
that
is
why
we
feel
that
we
are
no
longer
completely
free
and
that
something
resists
both
within
and
outside
ourselves
when
we
attempt
to
rid
ourselves
of
these
fundamental
notions
even
in
our
own
conscience
outside
of
us
there
is
public
opinion
which
judges
us
but
more
than
that
since
society
is
also
represented
inside
of
us
it
sets
itself
against
these
revolutionary
fancies
even
inside
of
ourselves
we
have
the
feeling
that
we
can
not
abandon
them
if
our
whole
thought
is
not
to
cease
being
really
human
this
seems
to
be
the
origin
of
the
exceptional
authority
which
is
inherent
in
the
reason
and
which
makes
us
accept
its
suggestions
with
confidence
it
is
the
very
authority
of
society
transferring
itself
to
a
certain
manner
of
thought
which
is
the
indispensable
condition
of
all
common
action
the
necessity
with
which
the
categories
are
imposed
upon
us
is
not
the
effect
of
simple
habits
whose
yoke
we
could
easily
throw
off
with
a
little
effort
nor
is
it
a
physical
or
metaphysical
necessity
since
the
categories
change
in
different
places
and
times
it
is
a
special
sort
of
moral
necessity
which
is
to
the
intellectual
life
what
moral
obligation
is
to
the
will
but
if
the
categories
originally
only
translate
social
states
does
it
not
follow
that
they
can
be
applied
to
the
rest
of
nature
only
as
metaphors
if
they
were
made
merely
to
express
social
conditions
it
seems
as
though
they
could
not
be
extended
to
other
realms
except
in
this
sense
thus
in
so
far
as
they
aid
us
in
thinking
of
the
physical
or
biological
world
they
have
only
the
value
of
artificial
symbols
useful
practically
perhaps
but
having
no
connection
with
reality
thus
we
come
back
by
a
different
road
to
nominalism
and
empiricism
but
when
we
interpret
a
sociological
theory
of
knowledge
in
this
way
we
forget
that
even
if
society
is
a
specific
reality
it
is
not
an
empire
within
an
empire
it
is
a
part
of
nature
and
indeed
its
highest
representation
the
social
realm
is
a
natural
realm
which
differs
from
the
others
only
by
a
greater
complexity
now
it
is
impossible
that
nature
should
differ
radically
from
itself
in
the
one
case
and
the
other
in
regard
to
that
which
is
most
essential
the
fundamental
relations
that
exist
between
things
just
that
which
it
is
the
function
of
the
categories
to
express
can
not
be
essentially
dissimilar
in
the
different
realms
if
for
reasons
which
we
shall
discuss
later
they
are
more
clearly
disengaged
in
the
social
world
it
is
nevertheless
impossible
that
they
should
not
be
found
elsewhere
though
in
less
pronounced
forms
society
makes
them
more
manifest
but
it
does
not
have
a
monopoly
upon
them
that
is
why
ideas
which
have
been
elaborated
on
the
model
of
social
things
can
aid
us
in
thinking
of
another
department
of
nature
it
is
at
least
true
that
if
these
ideas
play
the
rôle
of
symbols
when
they
are
thus
turned
aside
from
their
original
signification
they
are
symbols
if
a
sort
of
artificiality
enters
into
them
from
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
constructed
concepts
it
is
an
artificiality
which
follows
nature
very
closely
and
which
is
constantly
approaching
it
still
more
closely
from
the
fact
that
the
ideas
of
time
space
class
cause
or
personality
are
constructed
out
of
social
elements
it
is
not
necessary
to
conclude
that
they
are
devoid
of
all
objective
value
on
the
contrary
their
social
origin
rather
leads
to
the
belief
that
they
are
not
without
foundation
in
the
nature
of
things
thus
renovated
the
theory
of
knowledge
seems
destined
to
unite
the
opposing
advantages
of
the
two
rival
theories
without
incurring
their
inconveniences
it
keeps
all
the
essential
principles
of
the
apriorists
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
inspired
by
that
positive
spirit
which
the
empiricists
have
striven
to
satisfy
it
leaves
the
reason
its
specific
power
but
it
accounts
for
it
and
does
so
without
leaving
the
world
of
observable
phenomena
it
affirms
the
duality
of
our
intellectual
life
but
it
explains
it
and
with
natural
causes
the
categories
are
no
longer
considered
as
primary
and
unanalysable
facts
yet
they
keep
a
complexity
which
falsifies
any
analysis
as
ready
as
that
with
which
the
empiricists
content
themselves
they
no
longer
appear
as
very
simple
notions
which
the
first
comer
can
very
easily
arrange
from
his
own
personal
observations
and
which
the
popular
imagination
has
unluckily
complicated
but
rather
they
appear
as
priceless
instruments
of
thought
which
the
human
groups
have
laboriously
forged
through
the
centuries
and
where
they
have
accumulated
the
best
of
their
intellectual
capital
a
complete
section
of
the
history
of
humanity
is
resumed
therein
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
to
succeed
in
understanding
them
and
judging
them
it
is
necessary
to
resort
to
other
means
than
those
which
have
been
in
use
up
to
the
present
to
know
what
these
conceptions
which
we
have
not
made
ourselves
are
really
made
of
it
does
not
suffice
to
interrogate
our
own
consciousnesses
we
must
look
outside
of
ourselves
it
is
history
that
we
must
observe
there
is
a
whole
science
which
must
be
formed
a
complex
science
which
can
advance
but
slowly
and
by
collective
labour
and
to
which
the
present
work
brings
some
fragmentary
contributions
in
the
nature
of
an
attempt
without
making
these
questions
the
direct
object
of
our
study
we
shall
profit
by
all
the
occasions
which
present
themselves
to
us
of
catching
at
their
very
birth
some
at
least
of
these
ideas
which
while
being
of
religious
origin
still
remain
at
the
foundation
of
the
human
intelligence
book
i
preliminary
questions
chapter
i
definition
of
religious
phenomena
and
of
religion
if
we
are
going
to
look
for
the
most
primitive
and
simple
religion
which
we
can
observe
it
is
necessary
to
begin
by
defining
what
is
meant
by
a
religion
for
without
this
we
would
run
the
risk
of
giving
the
name
to
a
system
of
ideas
and
practices
which
has
nothing
at
all
religious
about
it
or
else
of
leaving
to
one
side
many
religious
facts
without
perceiving
their
true
nature
that
this
is
not
an
imaginary
danger
and
that
nothing
is
thus
sacrificed
to
a
vain
formalism
of
method
is
well
shown
by
the
fact
that
owing
to
his
not
having
taken
this
precaution
a
certain
scholar
to
whom
the
science
of
comparative
religions
owes
a
great
deal
professor
frazer
has
not
been
able
to
recognize
the
profoundly
religious
character
of
the
beliefs
and
rites
which
will
be
studied
below
where
according
to
our
view
the
initial
germ
of
the
religious
life
of
humanity
is
to
be
found
so
this
is
a
prejudicial
question
which
must
be
treated
before
all
others
it
is
not
that
we
dream
of
arriving
at
once
at
the
profound
characteristics
which
really
explain
religion
these
can
be
determined
only
at
the
end
of
our
study
but
that
which
is
necessary
and
possible
is
to
indicate
a
certain
number
of
external
and
easily
recognizable
signs
which
will
enable
us
to
recognize
religious
phenomena
wherever
they
are
met
with
and
which
will
deter
us
from
confounding
them
with
others
we
shall
proceed
to
this
preliminary
operation
at
once
but
to
attain
the
desired
results
it
is
necessary
to
begin
by
freeing
the
mind
of
every
preconceived
idea
men
have
been
obliged
to
make
for
themselves
a
notion
of
what
religion
is
long
before
the
science
of
religions
started
its
methodical
comparisons
the
necessities
of
existence
force
all
of
us
believers
and
to
represent
in
some
way
these
things
in
the
midst
of
which
we
live
upon
which
we
must
pass
judgment
constantly
and
which
we
must
take
into
account
in
all
our
conduct
however
since
these
preconceived
ideas
are
formed
without
any
method
according
to
the
circumstances
and
chances
of
life
they
have
no
right
to
any
credit
whatsoever
and
must
be
rigorously
set
aside
in
the
examination
which
is
to
follow
it
is
not
from
our
prejudices
passions
or
habits
that
we
should
demand
the
elements
of
the
definition
which
we
must
have
it
is
from
the
reality
itself
which
we
are
going
to
define
let
us
set
ourselves
before
this
reality
leaving
aside
all
conceptions
of
religion
in
general
let
us
consider
the
various
religions
in
their
concrete
reality
and
attempt
to
disengage
that
which
they
have
in
common
for
religion
can
not
be
defined
except
by
the
characteristics
which
are
found
wherever
religion
itself
is
found
in
this
comparison
then
we
shall
make
use
of
all
the
religious
systems
which
we
can
know
those
of
the
present
and
those
of
the
past
the
most
primitive
and
simple
as
well
as
the
most
recent
and
refined
for
we
have
neither
the
right
nor
the
logical
means
of
excluding
some
and
retaining
others
for
those
who
regard
religion
as
only
a
natural
manifestation
of
human
activity
all
religions
without
any
exception
whatsoever
are
instructive
for
all
after
their
manner
express
man
and
thus
can
aid
us
in
better
understanding
this
aspect
of
our
nature
also
we
have
seen
how
far
it
is
from
being
the
best
way
of
studying
religion
to
consider
by
preference
the
forms
which
it
presents
among
the
most
civilized
peoples
but
to
aid
the
mind
in
freeing
itself
from
these
usual
conceptions
which
owing
to
their
prestige
might
prevent
it
from
seeing
things
as
they
really
are
it
is
fitting
to
examine
some
of
the
most
current
of
the
definitions
in
which
these
prejudices
are
commonly
expressed
before
taking
up
the
question
on
our
own
account
i
one
idea
which
generally
passes
as
characteristic
of
all
that
is
religious
is
that
of
the
supernatural
by
this
is
understood
all
sorts
of
things
which
surpass
the
limits
of
our
knowledge
the
supernatural
is
the
world
of
the
mysterious
of
the
unknowable
of
the
thus
religion
would
be
a
sort
of
speculation
upon
all
that
which
evades
science
or
distinct
thought
in
general
religions
diametrically
opposed
in
their
overt
dogmas
said
spencer
are
perfectly
at
one
in
the
tacit
conviction
that
the
existence
of
the
world
with
all
it
contains
and
all
which
surrounds
it
is
a
mystery
calling
for
an
explanation
he
thus
makes
them
consist
essentially
in
the
belief
in
the
omnipresence
of
something
which
is
inscrutable
in
the
same
manner
max
müller
sees
in
religion
a
struggle
to
conceive
the
inconceivable
to
utter
the
unutterable
a
longing
after
the
infinite
it
is
certain
that
the
sentiment
of
mystery
has
not
been
without
a
considerable
importance
in
certain
religions
notably
in
christianity
it
must
also
be
said
that
the
importance
of
this
sentiment
has
varied
remarkably
at
different
moments
in
the
history
of
christianity
there
are
periods
when
this
notion
passes
to
an
inferior
place
and
is
even
effaced
for
example
for
the
christians
of
the
seventeenth
century
dogma
had
nothing
disturbing
for
the
reason
faith
reconciled
itself
easily
with
science
and
philosophy
and
the
thinkers
such
as
pascal
who
really
felt
that
there
is
something
profoundly
obscure
in
things
were
so
little
in
harmony
with
their
age
that
they
remained
misunderstood
by
their
contemporaries
it
would
appear
somewhat
hasty
therefore
to
make
an
idea
subject
to
parallel
eclipses
the
essential
element
of
even
the
christian
religion
in
all
events
it
is
certain
that
this
idea
does
not
appear
until
late
in
the
history
of
religions
it
is
completely
foreign
not
only
to
those
peoples
who
are
called
primitive
but
also
to
all
others
who
have
not
attained
a
considerable
degree
of
intellectual
culture
when
we
see
them
attribute
extraordinary
virtues
to
insignificant
objects
and
people
the
universe
with
singular
principles
made
up
of
the
most
diverse
elements
and
endowed
with
a
sort
of
ubiquity
which
is
hardly
representable
we
are
undoubtedly
prone
to
find
an
air
of
mystery
in
these
conceptions
it
seems
to
us
that
these
men
would
have
been
willing
to
resign
themselves
to
these
ideas
so
disturbing
for
our
modern
reason
only
because
of
their
inability
to
find
others
which
were
more
rational
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
explanations
which
surprise
us
so
much
appear
to
the
primitive
man
as
the
simplest
in
the
world
he
does
not
regard
them
as
a
sort
of
to
which
the
intellect
resigns
itself
only
in
despair
of
others
but
rather
as
the
most
obvious
manner
of
representing
and
understanding
what
he
sees
about
him
for
him
there
is
nothing
strange
in
the
fact
that
by
a
mere
word
or
gesture
one
is
able
to
command
the
elements
retard
or
precipitate
the
motion
of
the
stars
bring
rain
or
cause
it
to
cease
etc
the
rites
which
he
employs
to
assure
the
fertility
of
the
soil
or
the
fecundity
of
the
animal
species
on
which
he
is
nourished
do
not
appear
more
irrational
to
his
eyes
than
the
technical
processes
of
which
our
agriculturists
make
use
for
the
same
object
do
to
ours
the
powers
which
he
puts
into
play
by
these
diverse
means
do
not
seem
to
him
to
have
anything
especially
mysterious
about
them
undoubtedly
these
forces
are
different
from
those
which
the
modern
scientist
thinks
of
and
whose
use
he
teaches
us
they
have
a
different
way
of
acting
and
do
not
allow
themselves
to
be
directed
in
the
same
manner
but
for
those
who
believe
in
them
they
are
no
more
unintelligible
than
are
gravitation
and
electricity
for
the
physicist
of
moreover
we
shall
see
in
the
course
of
this
work
that
the
idea
of
physical
forces
is
very
probably
derived
from
that
of
religious
forces
then
there
can
not
exist
between
the
two
the
abyss
which
separates
the
rational
from
the
irrational
even
the
fact
that
religious
forces
are
frequently
conceived
under
the
form
of
spiritual
beings
or
conscious
wills
is
no
proof
of
their
irrationality
the
reason
has
no
repugnance
to
admitting
that
the
inanimate
bodies
should
be
directed
by
intelligences
just
as
the
human
body
is
though
contemporary
science
accommodates
itself
with
difficulty
to
this
hypothesis
when
leibniz
proposed
to
conceive
the
external
world
as
an
immense
society
of
minds
between
which
there
were
and
could
be
only
spiritual
relations
he
thought
he
was
working
as
a
rationalist
and
saw
nothing
in
this
universal
animism
which
could
be
offensive
to
the
intellect
moreover
the
idea
of
the
supernatural
as
we
understand
it
dates
only
from
in
fact
it
presupposes
the
contrary
idea
of
which
it
is
the
negation
but
this
idea
is
not
at
all
primitive
in
order
to
say
that
certain
things
are
supernatural
it
is
necessary
to
have
the
sentiment
that
a
order
of
exists
that
is
to
say
that
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
are
bound
together
by
necessary
relations
called
laws
when
this
principle
has
once
been
admitted
all
that
is
contrary
to
these
laws
must
necessarily
appear
to
be
outside
of
nature
and
consequently
of
reason
for
what
is
natural
in
this
sense
of
the
word
is
also
rational
these
necessary
relations
only
expressing
the
manner
in
which
things
are
logically
related
but
this
idea
of
universal
determinism
is
of
recent
origin
even
the
greatest
thinkers
of
classical
antiquity
never
succeeded
in
becoming
fully
conscious
of
it
it
is
a
conquest
of
the
positive
sciences
it
is
the
postulate
upon
which
they
repose
and
which
they
have
proved
by
their
progress
now
as
long
as
this
was
lacking
or
insufficiently
established
the
most
marvellous
events
contained
nothing
which
did
not
appear
perfectly
conceivable
so
long
as
men
did
not
know
the
immutability
and
the
inflexibility
of
the
order
of
things
and
so
long
as
they
saw
there
the
work
of
contingent
wills
they
found
it
natural
that
either
these
wills
or
others
could
modify
them
arbitrarily
that
is
why
the
miraculous
interventions
which
the
ancients
attributed
to
their
gods
were
not
to
their
eyes
miracles
in
the
modern
acceptation
of
the
term
for
them
they
were
beautiful
rare
or
terrible
spectacles
or
causes
of
surprise
and
marvel
greek
thaúmata
but
they
never
saw
in
them
glimpses
of
a
mysterious
world
into
which
the
reason
can
not
penetrate
we
can
understand
this
mentality
the
better
since
it
has
not
yet
completely
disappeared
from
our
midst
if
the
principle
of
determinism
is
solidly
established
in
the
physical
and
natural
sciences
it
is
only
a
century
ago
that
it
was
first
introduced
into
the
social
sciences
and
its
authority
there
is
still
contested
there
are
only
a
small
number
of
minds
which
are
strongly
penetrated
with
this
idea
that
societies
are
subject
to
natural
laws
and
form
a
kingdom
of
nature
it
follows
that
veritable
miracles
are
believed
to
be
possible
there
it
is
admitted
for
example
that
a
legislator
can
create
an
institution
out
of
nothing
by
a
mere
injunction
of
its
will
or
transform
one
social
system
into
another
just
as
the
believers
in
so
many
religions
have
held
that
the
divine
will
created
the
world
out
of
nothing
or
can
arbitrarily
transmute
one
thing
into
another
as
far
as
social
facts
are
concerned
we
still
have
the
mentality
of
primitives
however
if
so
many
of
our
contemporaries
still
retain
this
antiquated
conception
for
sociological
affairs
it
is
not
because
the
life
of
societies
appears
obscure
and
mysterious
to
them
on
the
contrary
if
they
are
so
easily
contented
with
these
explanations
and
if
they
are
so
obstinate
in
their
illusions
which
experience
constantly
belies
it
is
because
social
events
seem
to
them
the
clearest
thing
in
the
world
it
is
because
they
have
not
yet
realized
their
real
obscurity
it
is
because
they
have
not
yet
recognized
the
necessity
of
resorting
to
the
laborious
methods
of
the
natural
sciences
to
gradually
scatter
the
darkness
the
same
state
of
mind
is
found
at
the
root
of
many
religious
beliefs
which
surprise
us
by
their
it
is
science
and
not
religion
which
has
taught
men
that
things
are
complex
and
difficult
to
understand
but
the
human
mind
says
jevons
has
no
need
of
a
properly
scientific
culture
to
notice
that
determined
sequences
or
a
constant
order
of
succession
exist
between
facts
or
to
observe
on
the
other
hand
that
this
order
is
frequently
upset
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
sun
is
suddenly
eclipsed
that
rain
fails
at
the
time
when
it
is
expected
that
the
moon
is
slow
to
reappear
after
its
periodical
disappearance
etc
since
these
events
are
outside
the
ordinary
course
of
affairs
they
are
attributed
to
extraordinary
exceptional
causes
that
is
to
say
in
fine
to
causes
it
is
under
this
form
that
the
idea
of
the
supernatural
is
born
at
the
very
outset
of
history
and
from
this
moment
according
to
this
author
religious
thought
finds
itself
provided
with
its
proper
subject
but
in
the
first
place
the
supernatural
can
not
be
reduced
to
the
unforeseen
the
new
is
a
part
of
nature
just
as
well
as
its
contrary
if
we
state
that
in
general
phenomena
succeed
one
another
in
a
determined
order
we
observe
equally
well
that
this
order
is
only
approximative
that
it
is
not
always
precisely
the
same
and
that
it
has
all
kinds
of
exceptions
if
we
have
ever
so
little
experience
we
are
accustomed
to
seeing
our
expectations
fail
and
these
deceptions
return
too
often
to
appear
extraordinary
to
us
a
certain
contingency
is
taught
by
experience
just
as
well
as
a
certain
uniformity
then
we
have
no
reason
for
assigning
the
one
to
causes
and
forces
entirely
different
from
those
upon
which
the
other
depends
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
idea
of
the
supernatural
it
is
not
enough
therefore
to
be
witnesses
to
unexpected
events
it
is
also
necessary
that
these
be
conceived
as
impossible
that
is
to
say
irreconcilable
with
an
order
which
rightly
or
wrongly
appears
to
us
to
be
implied
in
the
nature
of
things
now
this
idea
of
a
necessary
order
has
been
constructed
little
by
little
by
the
positive
sciences
and
consequently
the
contrary
notion
could
not
have
existed
before
them
also
in
whatever
manner
men
have
represented
the
novelties
and
contingencies
revealed
by
experience
there
is
nothing
in
these
representations
which
could
serve
to
characterize
religion
for
religious
conceptions
have
as
their
object
before
everything
else
to
express
and
explain
not
that
which
is
exceptional
and
abnormal
in
things
but
on
the
contrary
that
which
is
constant
and
regular
very
frequently
the
gods
serve
less
to
account
for
the
monstrosities
fantasies
and
anomalies
than
for
the
regular
march
of
the
universe
for
the
movement
of
the
stars
the
rhythm
of
the
seasons
the
annual
growth
of
vegetation
the
perpetuation
of
species
etc
it
is
far
from
being
true
then
that
the
notion
of
the
religions
coincides
with
that
of
the
extraordinary
or
the
unforeseen
jevons
replies
that
this
conception
of
religious
forces
is
not
primitive
men
commenced
by
imagining
them
to
account
for
disorders
and
accidents
and
it
was
only
afterwards
that
they
began
to
utilize
them
in
explaining
the
uniformities
of
nature
but
it
is
not
clear
what
could
have
led
men
to
attribute
such
manifestly
contradictory
functions
to
them
more
than
that
the
hypothesis
according
to
which
sacred
beings
were
at
first
restricted
to
the
negative
function
of
disturbers
is
quite
arbitrary
in
fact
we
shall
see
that
even
with
the
most
simple
religions
we
know
their
essential
task
is
to
maintain
in
a
positive
manner
the
normal
course
of
life
so
the
idea
of
mystery
is
not
of
primitive
origin
it
was
not
given
to
man
it
is
man
who
has
forged
it
with
his
own
hands
along
with
the
contrary
idea
this
is
why
it
has
a
place
only
in
a
very
small
number
of
advanced
religions
it
is
impossible
to
make
it
the
characteristic
mark
of
religious
phenomena
without
excluding
from
the
definition
the
majority
of
the
facts
to
be
defined
ii
another
idea
by
which
the
attempt
to
define
religion
is
often
made
is
that
of
divinity
religion
says
réville
is
the
determination
of
human
life
by
the
sentiment
of
a
bond
uniting
the
human
mind
to
that
mysterious
mind
whose
domination
of
the
world
and
itself
it
recognizes
and
to
whom
it
delights
in
feeling
itself
united
it
is
certain
that
if
the
word
divinity
is
taken
in
a
precise
and
narrow
sense
this
definition
leaves
aside
a
multitude
of
obviously
religious
facts
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
the
spirits
of
all
ranks
and
classes
with
which
the
religious
imagination
of
so
many
different
peoples
has
populated
nature
are
always
the
object
of
rites
and
sometimes
even
of
a
regular
cult
yet
they
are
not
gods
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
but
in
order
that
the
definition
may
embrace
them
it
is
enough
to
substitute
for
the
term
gods
the
more
comprehensive
one
of
spiritual
beings
this
is
what
tylor
does
the
first
requisite
in
a
systematic
study
of
the
religions
of
the
lower
races
he
says
is
to
lay
down
a
rudimentary
definition
of
religion
by
requiring
in
this
definition
the
belief
in
a
supreme
deity
no
doubt
many
tribes
may
be
excluded
from
the
category
of
religious
but
such
narrow
definition
has
the
fault
of
identifying
religion
rather
with
particular
developments
it
seems
best
simply
to
claim
as
a
minimum
definition
of
religion
the
belief
in
spiritual
beings
by
spiritual
beings
must
be
understood
conscious
subjects
gifted
with
powers
superior
to
those
possessed
by
common
men
this
qualification
is
found
in
the
souls
of
the
dead
geniuses
or
demons
as
well
as
in
divinities
properly
it
is
important
therefore
to
give
our
attention
at
once
to
the
particular
conception
of
religion
which
is
implied
in
this
definition
the
relations
which
we
can
have
with
beings
of
this
sort
are
determined
by
the
nature
attributed
to
them
they
are
conscious
beings
then
we
can
act
upon
them
only
in
the
same
way
that
we
act
upon
consciousnesses
in
general
that
is
to
say
by
psychological
processes
attempting
to
convince
them
or
move
them
either
with
the
aid
of
words
invocations
prayers
or
by
offerings
and
sacrifices
and
since
the
object
of
religion
is
to
regulate
our
relations
with
these
special
beings
there
can
be
no
religion
except
where
there
are
prayers
sacrifices
propitiatory
rites
etc
thus
we
have
a
very
simple
criterium
which
permits
us
to
distinguish
that
which
is
religious
from
that
which
is
not
it
is
to
this
criterium
that
frazer
and
with
him
numerous
ethnographers
systematically
makes
reference
but
howsoever
evident
this
definition
may
appear
thanks
to
the
mental
habits
which
we
owe
to
our
religious
education
there
are
many
facts
to
which
it
is
not
applicable
but
which
appertain
to
the
field
of
religion
nevertheless
in
the
first
place
there
are
great
religions
from
which
the
idea
of
gods
and
spirits
is
absent
or
at
least
where
it
plays
only
a
secondary
and
minor
rôle
this
is
the
case
with
buddhism
buddhism
says
burnouf
sets
itself
in
opposition
to
brahmanism
as
a
moral
system
without
god
and
an
atheism
without
nature
as
it
recognizes
not
a
god
upon
whom
man
depends
says
barth
its
doctrine
is
absolutely
atheistic
while
oldenberg
in
his
turn
calls
it
a
faith
without
a
god
in
fact
all
that
is
essential
to
buddhism
is
found
in
the
four
propositions
which
the
faithful
call
the
four
noble
truths
the
first
states
the
existence
of
suffering
as
the
accompaniment
to
the
perpetual
change
of
things
the
second
shows
desire
to
be
the
cause
of
suffering
the
third
makes
the
suppression
of
desire
the
only
means
of
suppressing
sorrow
the
fourth
enumerates
the
three
stages
through
which
one
must
pass
to
attain
this
suppression
they
are
uprightness
meditation
and
finally
wisdom
the
full
possession
of
the
doctrine
these
three
stages
once
traversed
one
arrives
at
the
end
of
the
road
at
the
deliverance
at
salvation
by
the
nirvâna
now
in
none
of
these
principles
is
there
question
of
a
divinity
the
buddhist
is
not
interested
in
knowing
whence
came
the
world
in
which
he
lives
and
suffers
he
takes
it
as
a
given
fact
and
his
whole
concern
is
to
escape
it
on
the
other
hand
in
this
work
of
salvation
he
can
count
only
upon
himself
he
has
no
god
to
thank
as
he
had
previously
no
god
to
invoke
during
his
struggle
instead
of
praying
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
instead
of
turning
towards
a
superior
being
and
imploring
his
assistance
he
relies
upon
himself
and
meditates
this
is
not
saying
that
he
absolutely
denies
the
existence
of
the
beings
called
indra
agni
and
varuna
but
he
believes
that
he
owes
them
nothing
and
that
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
for
their
power
can
only
extend
over
the
goods
of
this
world
which
are
without
value
for
him
then
he
is
an
atheist
in
the
sense
that
he
does
not
concern
himself
with
the
question
whether
gods
exist
or
not
besides
even
if
they
should
exist
and
with
whatever
powers
they
might
be
armed
the
saint
or
the
emancipated
man
regards
himself
superior
to
them
for
that
which
causes
the
dignity
of
beings
is
not
the
extent
of
the
action
they
exercise
over
things
but
merely
the
degree
of
their
advancement
upon
the
road
of
salvation
it
is
true
that
buddha
at
least
in
some
divisions
of
the
buddhist
church
has
sometimes
been
considered
as
a
sort
of
god
he
has
his
temples
he
is
the
object
of
a
cult
which
by
the
way
is
a
very
simple
one
for
it
is
reduced
essentially
to
the
offering
of
flowers
and
the
adoration
of
consecrated
relics
or
images
it
is
scarcely
more
than
a
commemorative
cult
but
more
than
that
this
divinization
of
buddha
granting
that
the
term
is
exact
is
peculiar
to
the
form
known
as
northern
buddhism
the
buddhist
of
the
south
says
kern
and
the
less
advanced
of
the
northern
buddhists
can
be
said
according
to
data
known
to
speak
of
their
founder
as
if
he
were
a
man
of
course
they
attribute
extraordinary
powers
to
buddha
which
are
superior
to
those
possessed
by
ordinary
mortals
but
it
was
a
very
ancient
belief
in
india
and
one
that
is
also
very
general
in
a
host
of
different
religions
that
a
great
saint
is
endowed
with
exceptional
virtues
yet
a
saint
is
not
a
god
any
more
than
a
priest
or
magician
is
in
spite
of
the
superhuman
faculties
frequently
attributed
to
them
on
the
other
hand
according
to
the
most
authorized
scholars
all
this
theism
and
the
complicated
mythology
which
generally
accompanies
it
are
only
derived
and
deviated
forms
of
buddhism
at
first
buddha
was
only
regarded
as
the
wisest
of
men
burnouf
says
the
conception
of
a
buddha
who
is
something
more
than
a
man
arrived
at
the
highest
stage
of
holiness
is
outside
the
circle
of
ideas
which
form
the
foundation
of
the
simple
sûtras
and
the
same
author
adds
elsewhere
that
his
humanity
is
a
fact
so
incontestably
recognized
by
all
that
the
to
whom
miracles
cost
so
little
have
never
even
had
the
idea
of
making
a
god
out
of
him
since
his
death
so
we
may
well
ask
if
he
has
ever
really
divested
himself
completely
of
all
human
character
and
if
we
have
a
right
to
make
him
into
a
god
completely
in
any
case
it
would
have
to
be
a
god
of
a
very
particular
character
and
one
whose
rôle
in
no
way
resembles
that
of
other
divine
personalities
for
a
god
is
before
all
else
a
living
being
with
whom
man
should
reckon
and
upon
whom
he
may
count
but
buddha
is
dead
he
has
entered
into
the
nirvâna
and
he
can
no
longer
influence
the
march
of
human
events
finally
whatever
one
may
think
of
the
divinity
of
buddha
it
remains
a
fact
that
this
is
a
conception
wholly
outside
the
essential
part
of
buddhism
buddhism
consists
primarily
in
the
idea
of
salvation
and
salvation
supposes
only
that
one
know
the
good
doctrine
and
practise
it
to
be
sure
this
could
never
have
been
known
if
buddha
had
not
come
to
reveal
it
but
when
this
revelation
had
once
been
made
the
work
of
buddha
was
accomplished
from
that
moment
he
ceased
to
be
a
factor
necessary
to
the
religious
life
the
practice
of
the
four
holy
truths
would
be
possible
even
if
the
memory
of
him
who
revealed
them
were
completely
obliterated
it
is
quite
another
matter
with
christianity
which
is
inconceivable
without
the
idea
of
christ
and
his
cult
for
it
is
by
the
christ
sacrificed
each
day
that
the
community
of
believers
continues
to
communicate
with
the
supreme
source
of
the
spiritual
life
all
that
precedes
can
be
applied
equally
well
to
another
great
religion
of
india
jaïnism
the
two
doctrines
have
nearly
the
same
conception
of
the
world
and
of
life
like
the
buddhists
says
barth
the
jaïnas
are
atheists
they
admit
of
no
creator
the
world
is
eternal
they
explicitly
deny
the
possibility
of
a
perfect
being
from
the
beginning
the
jina
became
perfect
he
was
not
always
so
just
as
the
buddhists
in
the
north
the
jaïnists
or
at
least
certain
of
them
have
come
back
to
a
sort
of
deism
in
the
inscriptions
of
dekhan
there
is
mention
of
a
a
sort
of
supreme
jina
who
is
called
the
primary
creator
but
such
language
says
the
same
author
is
in
contradiction
to
the
most
explicit
declarations
extracted
from
their
most
authorized
writings
moreover
if
this
indifference
for
the
divine
is
developed
to
such
a
point
in
buddhism
and
jaïnism
it
is
because
its
germ
existed
already
in
the
brahmanism
from
which
the
two
were
derived
in
certain
of
its
forms
at
least
brahmic
speculation
ended
in
a
frankly
materialistic
and
atheistic
interpretation
of
the
universe
in
time
the
numerous
divinities
which
the
people
of
india
had
originally
learned
to
adore
came
to
merge
themselves
into
a
sort
of
principal
deity
impersonal
and
abstract
the
essence
of
all
that
exists
this
supreme
reality
which
no
longer
has
anything
of
a
divine
personality
about
it
is
contained
within
man
himself
or
rather
man
is
but
one
with
it
for
nothing
exists
apart
from
it
to
find
it
and
unite
himself
to
it
one
does
not
have
to
search
some
external
support
outside
himself
it
is
enough
to
concentrate
upon
himself
and
meditate
if
in
buddhism
says
oldenberg
the
proud
attempt
be
made
to
conceive
a
deliverance
in
which
man
himself
delivers
himself
to
create
a
faith
without
a
god
it
is
brahmanical
speculation
which
has
prepared
the
way
for
this
thought
it
thrusts
back
the
idea
of
a
god
step
by
step
the
forms
of
the
old
gods
have
faded
away
and
besides
the
brahma
which
is
enthroned
in
its
everlasting
quietude
highly
exalted
above
the
destinies
of
the
human
world
there
is
left
remaining
as
the
sole
really
active
person
in
the
great
work
of
deliverance
man
himself
here
then
we
find
a
considerable
portion
of
religious
evolution
which
has
consisted
in
the
progressive
recoil
of
the
idea
of
a
spiritual
being
from
that
of
a
deity
here
are
great
religions
where
invocations
propitiations
sacrifices
and
prayers
properly
are
far
from
holding
a
preponderating
place
and
which
consequently
do
not
present
that
distinctive
sign
by
which
some
claim
to
recognize
those
manifestations
which
are
properly
called
religious
but
even
within
deistic
religions
there
are
many
rites
which
are
completely
independent
of
all
idea
of
gods
or
spiritual
beings
in
the
first
place
there
are
a
multitude
of
interdictions
for
example
the
bible
orders
that
a
woman
live
isolated
during
a
determined
period
each
month
a
similar
isolation
is
obligatory
during
the
at
it
is
forbidden
to
hitch
an
ass
and
a
horse
together
or
to
wear
a
garment
in
which
the
hemp
is
mixed
with
flax
but
it
is
impossible
to
see
the
part
which
belief
in
jahveh
can
have
played
in
these
interdictions
for
he
is
wholly
absent
from
all
the
relations
thus
forbidden
and
could
not
be
interested
in
them
as
much
can
be
said
for
the
majority
of
the
dietetic
regulations
these
prohibitions
are
not
peculiar
to
the
hebrews
but
they
are
found
under
diverse
forms
but
with
substantially
the
same
character
in
innumerable
religions
it
is
true
that
these
rites
are
purely
negative
but
they
do
not
cease
being
religious
for
that
also
there
are
others
which
demand
active
and
positive
services
of
the
faithful
but
which
are
nevertheless
of
the
same
nature
they
work
by
themselves
and
their
efficacy
depends
upon
no
divine
power
they
mechanically
produce
the
effects
which
are
the
reason
for
their
existence
they
do
not
consist
either
in
prayers
or
offerings
addressed
to
a
being
upon
whose
goodwill
the
expected
result
depends
this
result
is
obtained
by
the
automatic
operation
of
the
ritual
such
is
notably
the
case
with
the
sacrifice
of
the
vedic
religion
the
sacrifice
exercises
a
direct
influence
upon
the
celestial
phenomena
says
bergaigne
it
is
of
itself
and
without
any
divine
influence
it
is
this
for
example
which
broke
open
the
doors
of
the
cavern
where
the
dawn
was
imprisoned
and
which
made
the
light
of
day
burst
forth
in
the
same
way
there
are
special
hymns
which
by
their
direct
action
made
the
waters
of
heaven
fall
upon
the
earth
and
in
spite
of
the
the
practice
of
certain
austerities
has
the
same
power
more
than
that
the
sacrifice
is
so
fully
the
origin
of
things
that
they
have
attributed
to
it
not
only
the
origin
of
man
but
even
that
of
the
gods
such
a
conception
may
well
appear
strange
it
is
explained
however
as
being
one
of
the
ultimate
consequences
of
the
idea
of
the
omnipotence
of
sacrifice
thus
in
the
entire
first
part
of
his
work
bergaigne
speaks
only
of
sacrifices
where
divinities
play
no
rôle
whatsoever
nor
is
this
fact
peculiar
to
the
vedic
religion
but
is
on
the
contrary
quite
general
in
every
cult
there
are
practices
which
act
by
themselves
by
a
virtue
which
is
their
own
without
the
intervention
of
any
god
between
the
individual
who
practises
the
rite
and
the
end
sought
after
when
in
the
feast
of
the
tabernacles
the
jew
set
the
air
in
motion
by
shaking
willow
branches
in
a
certain
rhythm
it
was
to
cause
the
wind
to
rise
and
the
rain
to
fall
and
it
was
believed
that
the
desired
phenomenon
would
result
automatically
from
the
rite
provided
it
were
correctly
performed
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
fundamental
importance
laid
by
nearly
all
cults
upon
the
material
portion
of
the
ceremonies
this
religious
formalism
very
probably
the
first
form
of
legal
formalism
comes
from
the
fact
that
since
the
formula
to
be
pronounced
and
the
movements
to
be
made
contain
within
themselves
the
source
of
their
efficacy
they
would
lose
it
if
they
did
not
conform
absolutely
to
the
type
consecrated
by
success
thus
there
are
rites
without
gods
and
even
rites
from
which
gods
are
derived
all
religious
powers
do
not
emanate
from
divine
personalities
and
there
are
relations
of
cult
which
have
other
objects
than
uniting
man
to
a
deity
religion
is
more
than
the
idea
of
gods
or
spirits
and
consequently
can
not
be
defined
exclusively
in
relation
to
these
latter
iii
these
definitions
set
aside
let
us
set
ourselves
before
the
problem
first
of
all
let
us
remark
that
in
all
these
formulæ
it
is
the
nature
of
religion
as
a
whole
that
they
seek
to
express
they
proceed
as
if
it
were
a
sort
of
indivisible
entity
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
made
up
of
parts
it
is
a
more
or
less
complex
system
of
myths
dogmas
rites
and
ceremonies
now
a
whole
can
not
be
defined
except
in
relation
to
its
parts
it
will
be
more
methodical
then
to
try
to
characterize
the
various
elementary
phenomena
of
which
all
religions
are
made
up
before
we
attack
the
system
produced
by
their
union
this
method
is
imposed
still
more
forcibly
by
the
fact
that
there
are
religious
phenomena
which
belong
to
no
determined
religion
such
are
those
phenomena
which
constitute
the
matter
of
in
general
they
are
the
debris
of
passed
religions
inorganized
survivals
but
there
are
some
which
have
been
formed
spontaneously
under
the
influence
of
local
causes
in
our
european
countries
christianity
has
forced
itself
to
absorb
and
assimilate
them
it
has
given
them
a
christian
colouring
nevertheless
there
are
many
which
have
persisted
up
until
a
recent
date
or
which
still
exist
with
a
relative
autonomy
celebrations
of
may
day
the
summer
solstice
or
the
carnival
beliefs
relative
to
genii
local
demons
are
cases
in
point
if
the
religious
character
of
these
facts
is
now
diminishing
their
religious
importance
is
nevertheless
so
great
that
they
have
enabled
mannhardt
and
his
school
to
revive
the
science
of
religions
a
definition
which
did
not
take
account
of
them
would
not
cover
all
that
is
religious
religious
phenomena
are
naturally
arranged
in
two
fundamental
categories
beliefs
and
rites
the
first
are
states
of
opinion
and
consist
in
representations
the
second
are
determined
modes
of
action
between
these
two
classes
of
facts
there
is
all
the
difference
which
separates
thought
from
action
the
rites
can
be
defined
and
distinguished
from
other
human
practices
moral
practices
for
example
only
by
the
special
nature
of
their
object
a
moral
rule
prescribes
certain
manners
of
acting
to
us
just
as
a
rite
does
but
which
are
addressed
to
a
different
class
of
objects
so
it
is
the
object
of
the
rite
which
must
be
characterized
if
we
are
to
characterize
the
rite
itself
now
it
is
in
the
beliefs
that
the
special
nature
of
this
object
is
expressed
it
is
possible
to
define
the
rite
only
after
we
have
defined
the
belief
all
known
religious
beliefs
whether
simple
or
complex
present
one
common
characteristic
they
presuppose
a
classification
of
all
the
things
real
and
ideal
of
which
men
think
into
two
classes
or
opposed
groups
generally
designated
by
two
distinct
terms
which
are
translated
well
enough
by
the
words
and
this
division
of
the
world
into
two
domains
the
one
containing
all
that
is
sacred
the
other
all
that
is
profane
is
the
distinctive
trait
of
religious
thought
the
beliefs
myths
dogmas
and
legends
are
either
representations
or
systems
of
representations
which
express
the
nature
of
sacred
things
the
virtues
and
powers
which
are
attributed
to
them
or
their
relations
with
each
other
and
with
profane
things
but
by
sacred
things
one
must
not
understand
simply
those
personal
beings
which
are
called
gods
or
spirits
a
rock
a
tree
a
spring
a
pebble
a
piece
of
wood
a
house
in
a
word
anything
can
be
sacred
a
rite
can
have
this
character
in
fact
the
rite
does
not
exist
which
does
not
have
it
to
a
certain
degree
there
are
words
expressions
and
formulæ
which
can
be
pronounced
only
by
the
mouths
of
consecrated
persons
there
are
gestures
and
movements
which
everybody
can
not
perform
if
the
vedic
sacrifice
has
had
such
an
efficacy
that
according
to
mythology
it
was
the
creator
of
the
gods
and
not
merely
a
means
of
winning
their
favour
it
is
because
it
possessed
a
virtue
comparable
to
that
of
the
most
sacred
beings
the
circle
of
sacred
objects
can
not
be
determined
then
once
for
all
its
extent
varies
infinitely
according
to
the
different
religions
that
is
how
buddhism
is
a
religion
in
default
of
gods
it
admits
the
existence
of
sacred
things
namely
the
four
noble
truths
and
the
practices
derived
from
them
up
to
the
present
we
have
confined
ourselves
to
enumerating
a
certain
number
of
sacred
things
as
examples
we
must
now
show
by
what
general
characteristics
they
are
to
be
distinguished
from
profane
things
one
might
be
tempted
first
of
all
to
define
them
by
the
place
they
are
generally
assigned
in
the
hierarchy
of
things
they
are
naturally
considered
superior
in
dignity
and
power
to
profane
things
and
particularly
to
man
when
he
is
only
a
man
and
has
nothing
sacred
about
him
one
thinks
of
himself
as
occupying
an
inferior
and
dependent
position
in
relation
to
them
and
surely
this
conception
is
not
without
some
truth
only
there
is
nothing
in
it
which
is
really
characteristic
of
the
sacred
it
is
not
enough
that
one
thing
be
subordinated
to
another
for
the
second
to
be
sacred
in
regard
to
the
first
slaves
are
inferior
to
their
masters
subjects
to
their
king
soldiers
to
their
leaders
the
miser
to
his
gold
the
man
ambitious
for
power
to
the
hands
which
keep
it
from
him
but
if
it
is
sometimes
said
of
a
man
that
he
makes
a
religion
of
those
beings
or
things
whose
eminent
value
and
superiority
to
himself
he
thus
recognizes
it
is
clear
that
in
any
case
the
word
is
taken
in
a
metaphorical
sense
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
these
relations
which
is
really
religious
on
the
other
hand
it
must
not
be
lost
to
view
that
there
are
sacred
things
of
every
degree
and
that
there
are
some
in
relation
to
which
a
man
feels
himself
relatively
at
his
ease
an
amulet
has
a
sacred
character
yet
the
respect
which
it
inspires
is
nothing
exceptional
even
before
his
gods
a
man
is
not
always
in
such
a
marked
state
of
inferiority
for
it
very
frequently
happens
that
he
exercises
a
veritable
physical
constraint
upon
them
to
obtain
what
he
desires
he
beats
the
fetich
with
which
he
is
not
contented
but
only
to
reconcile
himself
with
it
again
if
in
the
end
it
shows
itself
more
docile
to
the
wishes
of
its
adorer
to
have
rain
he
throws
stones
into
the
spring
or
sacred
lake
where
the
god
of
rain
is
thought
to
reside
he
believes
that
by
this
means
he
forces
him
to
come
out
and
show
himself
moreover
if
it
is
true
that
man
depends
upon
his
gods
this
dependence
is
reciprocal
the
gods
also
have
need
of
man
without
offerings
and
sacrifices
they
would
die
we
shall
even
have
occasion
to
show
that
this
dependence
of
the
gods
upon
their
worshippers
is
maintained
even
in
the
most
idealistic
religions
but
if
a
purely
hierarchic
distinction
is
a
criterium
at
once
too
general
and
too
imprecise
there
is
nothing
left
with
which
to
characterize
the
sacred
in
its
relation
to
the
profane
except
their
heterogeneity
however
this
heterogeneity
is
sufficient
to
characterize
this
classification
of
things
and
to
distinguish
it
from
all
others
because
it
is
very
particular
is
in
all
the
history
of
human
thought
there
exists
no
other
example
of
two
categories
of
things
so
profoundly
differentiated
or
so
radically
opposed
to
one
another
the
traditional
opposition
of
good
and
bad
is
nothing
beside
this
for
the
good
and
the
bad
are
only
two
opposed
species
of
the
same
class
namely
morals
just
as
sickness
and
health
are
two
different
aspects
of
the
same
order
of
facts
life
while
the
sacred
and
the
profane
have
always
and
everywhere
been
conceived
by
the
human
mind
as
two
distinct
classes
as
two
worlds
between
which
there
is
nothing
in
common
the
forces
which
play
in
one
are
not
simply
those
which
are
met
with
in
the
other
but
a
little
stronger
they
are
of
a
different
sort
in
different
religions
this
opposition
has
been
conceived
in
different
ways
here
to
separate
these
two
sorts
of
things
it
has
seemed
sufficient
to
localize
them
in
different
parts
of
the
physical
universe
there
the
first
have
been
put
into
an
ideal
and
transcendental
world
while
the
material
world
is
left
in
full
possession
of
the
others
but
howsoever
much
the
forms
of
the
contrast
may
vary
the
fact
of
the
contrast
is
universal
this
is
not
equivalent
to
saying
that
a
being
can
never
pass
from
one
of
these
worlds
into
the
other
but
the
manner
in
which
this
passage
is
effected
when
it
does
take
place
puts
into
relief
the
essential
duality
of
the
two
kingdoms
in
fact
it
implies
a
veritable
metamorphosis
this
is
notably
demonstrated
by
the
initiation
rites
such
as
they
are
practised
by
a
multitude
of
peoples
this
initiation
is
a
long
series
of
ceremonies
with
the
object
of
introducing
the
young
man
into
the
religious
life
for
the
first
time
he
leaves
the
purely
profane
world
where
he
passed
his
first
infancy
and
enters
into
the
world
of
sacred
things
now
this
change
of
state
is
thought
of
not
as
a
simple
and
regular
development
of
germs
but
as
a
transformation
of
the
whole
being
it
is
said
that
at
this
moment
the
young
man
dies
that
the
person
that
he
was
ceases
to
exist
and
that
another
is
instantly
substituted
for
it
he
is
under
a
new
form
appropriate
ceremonies
are
felt
to
bring
about
this
death
and
which
are
not
understood
in
a
merely
symbolic
sense
but
are
taken
literally
does
this
not
prove
that
between
the
profane
being
which
he
was
and
the
religious
being
which
he
becomes
there
is
a
break
of
continuity
this
heterogeneity
is
even
so
complete
that
it
frequently
degenerates
into
a
veritable
antagonism
the
two
worlds
are
not
only
conceived
of
as
separate
but
as
even
hostile
and
jealous
rivals
of
each
other
since
men
can
not
fully
belong
to
one
except
on
condition
of
leaving
the
other
completely
they
are
exhorted
to
withdraw
themselves
completely
from
the
profane
world
in
order
to
lead
an
exclusively
religious
life
hence
comes
the
monasticism
which
is
artificially
organized
outside
of
and
apart
from
the
natural
environment
in
which
the
ordinary
man
leads
the
life
of
this
world
in
a
different
one
closed
to
the
first
and
nearly
its
contrary
hence
comes
the
mystic
asceticism
whose
object
is
to
root
out
from
man
all
the
attachment
for
the
profane
world
that
remains
in
him
from
that
come
all
the
forms
of
religious
suicide
the
logical
of
this
asceticism
for
the
only
manner
of
fully
escaping
the
profane
life
is
after
all
to
forsake
all
life
the
opposition
of
these
two
classes
manifests
itself
outwardly
with
a
visible
sign
by
which
we
can
easily
recognize
this
very
special
classification
wherever
it
exists
since
the
idea
of
the
sacred
is
always
and
everywhere
separated
from
the
idea
of
the
profane
in
the
thought
of
men
and
since
we
picture
a
sort
of
logical
chasm
between
the
two
the
mind
irresistibly
refuses
to
allow
the
two
corresponding
things
to
be
confounded
or
even
to
be
merely
put
in
contact
with
each
other
for
such
a
promiscuity
or
even
too
direct
a
contiguity
would
contradict
too
violently
the
dissociation
of
these
ideas
in
the
mind
the
sacred
thing
is
that
which
the
profane
should
not
touch
and
can
not
touch
with
impunity
to
be
sure
this
interdiction
can
not
go
so
far
as
to
make
all
communication
between
the
two
worlds
impossible
for
if
the
profane
could
in
no
way
enter
into
relations
with
the
sacred
this
latter
could
be
good
for
nothing
but
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
establishment
of
relations
is
always
a
delicate
operation
in
itself
demanding
great
precautions
and
a
more
or
less
complicated
initiation
it
is
quite
impossible
unless
the
profane
is
to
lose
its
specific
characteristics
and
become
sacred
after
a
fashion
and
to
a
certain
degree
itself
the
two
classes
can
not
even
approach
each
other
and
keep
their
own
nature
at
the
same
time
thus
we
arrive
at
the
first
criterium
of
religious
beliefs
undoubtedly
there
are
secondary
species
within
these
two
fundamental
classes
which
in
their
turn
are
more
or
less
incompatible
with
each
other
but
the
real
characteristic
of
religious
phenomena
is
that
they
always
suppose
a
bipartite
division
of
the
whole
universe
known
and
knowable
into
two
classes
which
embrace
all
that
exists
but
which
radically
exclude
each
other
sacred
things
are
those
which
the
interdictions
protect
and
isolate
profane
things
those
to
which
these
interdictions
are
applied
and
which
must
remain
at
a
distance
from
the
first
religious
beliefs
are
the
representations
which
express
the
nature
of
sacred
things
and
the
relations
which
they
sustain
either
with
each
other
or
with
profane
things
finally
rites
are
the
rules
of
conduct
which
prescribe
how
a
man
should
comport
himself
in
the
presence
of
these
sacred
objects
when
a
certain
number
of
sacred
things
sustain
relations
of
or
subordination
with
each
other
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
system
having
a
certain
unity
but
which
is
not
comprised
within
any
other
system
of
the
same
sort
the
totality
of
these
beliefs
and
their
corresponding
rites
constitutes
a
religion
from
this
definition
it
is
seen
that
a
religion
is
not
necessarily
contained
within
one
sole
and
single
idea
and
does
not
proceed
from
one
unique
principle
which
though
varying
according
to
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
applied
is
nevertheless
at
bottom
always
the
same
it
is
rather
a
whole
made
up
of
distinct
and
relatively
individualized
parts
each
homogeneous
group
of
sacred
things
or
even
each
sacred
thing
of
some
importance
constitutes
a
centre
of
organization
about
which
gravitate
a
group
of
beliefs
and
rites
or
a
particular
cult
there
is
no
religion
howsoever
unified
it
may
be
which
does
not
recognize
a
plurality
of
sacred
things
even
christianity
at
least
in
its
catholic
form
admits
in
addition
to
the
divine
personality
which
incidentally
is
triple
as
well
as
one
the
virgin
angels
saints
souls
of
the
dead
etc
thus
a
religion
can
not
be
reduced
to
one
single
cult
generally
but
father
consists
in
a
system
of
cults
each
endowed
with
a
certain
autonomy
also
this
autonomy
is
variable
sometimes
they
are
arranged
in
a
hierarchy
and
subordinated
to
some
predominating
cult
into
which
they
are
finally
absorbed
but
sometimes
also
they
are
merely
rearranged
and
united
the
religion
which
we
are
going
to
study
will
furnish
us
with
an
example
of
just
this
latter
sort
of
organization
at
the
same
time
we
find
the
explanation
of
how
there
can
be
groups
of
religious
phenomena
which
do
not
belong
to
any
special
religion
it
is
because
they
have
not
been
or
are
no
longer
a
part
of
any
religious
system
if
for
some
special
reason
one
of
the
cults
of
which
we
just
spoke
happens
to
be
maintained
while
the
group
of
which
it
was
a
part
disappears
it
survives
only
in
a
disintegrated
condition
that
is
what
has
happened
to
many
agrarian
cults
which
have
survived
themselves
as
in
certain
cases
it
is
not
even
a
cult
but
a
simple
ceremony
or
particular
rite
which
persists
in
this
way
although
this
definition
is
only
preliminary
it
permits
us
to
see
in
what
terms
the
problem
which
necessarily
dominates
the
science
of
religions
should
be
stated
when
we
believed
that
sacred
beings
could
be
distinguished
from
others
merely
by
the
greater
intensity
of
the
powers
attributed
to
them
the
question
of
how
men
came
to
imagine
them
was
sufficiently
simple
it
was
enough
to
demand
which
forces
had
because
of
their
exceptional
energy
been
able
to
strike
the
human
imagination
forcefully
enough
to
inspire
religious
sentiments
but
if
as
we
have
sought
to
establish
sacred
things
differ
in
nature
from
profane
things
if
they
have
a
wholly
different
essence
then
the
problem
is
more
complex
for
we
must
first
of
all
ask
what
has
been
able
to
lead
men
to
see
in
the
world
two
heterogeneous
and
incompatible
worlds
though
nothing
sensible
experience
seems
able
to
suggest
the
idea
of
so
radical
a
duality
to
them
iv
however
this
definition
is
not
yet
complete
for
it
is
equally
applicable
to
two
sorts
of
facts
which
while
being
related
to
each
other
must
be
distinguished
nevertheless
these
are
magic
and
religion
magic
too
is
made
up
of
beliefs
and
rites
like
religion
it
has
its
myths
and
its
dogmas
only
they
are
more
elementary
undoubtedly
because
seeking
technical
and
utilitarian
ends
it
does
not
waste
its
time
in
pure
speculation
it
has
its
ceremonies
sacrifices
lustrations
prayers
chants
and
dances
as
well
the
beings
which
the
magician
invokes
and
the
forces
which
he
throws
in
play
are
not
merely
of
the
same
nature
as
the
forces
and
beings
to
which
religion
addresses
itself
very
frequently
they
are
identically
the
same
thus
even
with
the
most
inferior
societies
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
essentially
sacred
things
and
the
object
of
religious
rites
but
at
the
same
time
they
play
a
considerable
rôle
in
magic
in
australia
as
well
as
in
melanesia
in
greece
as
well
as
among
the
christian
peoples
the
souls
of
the
dead
their
bones
and
their
hair
are
among
the
intermediaries
used
the
most
frequently
by
the
magician
demons
are
also
a
common
instrument
for
magic
action
now
these
demons
are
also
beings
surrounded
with
interdictions
they
too
are
separated
and
live
in
a
world
apart
so
that
it
is
frequently
difficult
to
distinguish
them
from
the
gods
properly
moreover
in
christianity
itself
is
not
the
devil
a
fallen
god
or
even
leaving
aside
all
question
of
his
origin
does
he
not
have
a
religious
character
from
the
mere
fact
that
the
hell
of
which
he
has
charge
is
something
indispensable
to
the
christian
religion
there
are
even
some
regular
and
official
deities
who
are
invoked
by
the
magician
sometimes
these
are
the
gods
of
a
foreign
people
for
example
greek
magicians
called
upon
egyptian
assyrian
or
jewish
gods
sometimes
they
are
even
national
gods
hecate
and
diana
were
the
object
of
a
magic
cult
the
virgin
christ
and
the
saints
have
been
utilized
in
the
same
way
by
christian
magicians
then
will
it
be
necessary
to
say
that
magic
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
religion
that
magic
is
full
of
religion
just
as
religion
is
full
of
magic
and
consequently
that
it
is
impossible
to
separate
them
and
to
define
the
one
without
the
other
it
is
difficult
to
sustain
this
thesis
because
of
the
marked
repugnance
of
religion
for
magic
and
in
return
the
hostility
of
the
second
towards
the
first
magic
takes
a
sort
of
professional
pleasure
in
profaning
holy
things
in
its
rites
it
performs
the
contrary
of
the
religious
ceremony
on
its
side
religion
when
it
has
not
condemned
and
prohibited
magic
rites
has
always
looked
upon
them
with
disfavour
as
hubert
and
mauss
have
remarked
there
is
something
thoroughly
in
the
doings
of
the
magician
whatever
relations
there
may
be
between
these
two
sorts
of
institutions
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
their
not
being
opposed
somewhere
and
it
is
still
more
necessary
for
us
to
find
where
they
are
differentiated
as
we
plan
to
limit
our
researches
to
religion
and
to
stop
at
the
point
where
magic
commences
here
is
how
a
line
of
demarcation
can
be
traced
between
these
two
domains
the
really
religious
beliefs
are
always
common
to
a
determined
group
which
makes
profession
of
adhering
to
them
and
of
practising
the
rites
connected
with
them
they
are
not
merely
received
individually
by
all
the
members
of
this
group
they
are
something
belonging
to
the
group
and
they
make
its
unity
the
individuals
which
compose
it
feel
themselves
united
to
each
other
by
the
simple
fact
that
they
have
a
common
faith
a
society
whose
members
are
united
by
the
fact
that
they
think
in
the
same
way
in
regard
to
the
sacred
world
and
its
relations
with
the
profane
world
and
by
the
fact
that
they
translate
these
common
ideas
into
common
practices
is
what
is
called
a
church
in
all
history
we
do
not
find
a
single
religion
without
a
church
sometimes
the
church
is
strictly
national
sometimes
it
passes
the
frontiers
sometimes
it
embraces
an
entire
people
rome
athens
the
hebrews
sometimes
it
embraces
only
a
part
of
them
the
christian
societies
since
the
advent
of
protestantism
sometimes
it
is
directed
by
a
corps
of
priests
sometimes
it
is
almost
completely
devoid
of
any
official
directing
body
but
wherever
we
observe
the
religious
life
we
find
that
it
has
a
definite
group
as
its
foundation
even
the
private
cults
such
as
the
domestic
cult
or
the
cult
of
a
corporation
satisfy
this
condition
for
they
are
always
celebrated
by
a
group
the
family
or
the
corporation
moreover
even
these
particular
religions
are
ordinarily
only
special
forms
of
a
more
general
religion
which
embraces
all
these
restricted
churches
are
in
reality
only
chapels
of
a
vaster
church
which
by
reason
of
this
very
extent
merits
this
name
still
more
it
is
quite
another
matter
with
magic
to
be
sure
the
belief
in
magic
is
always
more
or
less
general
it
is
very
frequently
diffused
in
large
masses
of
the
population
and
there
are
even
peoples
where
it
has
as
many
adherents
as
the
real
religion
but
it
does
not
result
in
binding
together
those
who
adhere
to
it
nor
in
uniting
them
into
a
group
leading
a
common
life
is
no
church
of
between
the
magician
and
the
individuals
who
consult
him
as
between
these
individuals
themselves
there
are
no
lasting
bonds
which
make
them
members
of
the
same
moral
community
comparable
to
that
formed
by
the
believers
in
the
same
god
or
the
observers
of
the
same
cult
the
magician
has
a
clientele
and
not
a
church
and
it
is
very
possible
that
his
clients
have
no
other
relations
between
each
other
or
even
do
not
know
each
other
even
the
relations
which
they
have
with
him
are
generally
accidental
and
transient
they
are
just
like
those
of
a
sick
man
with
his
physician
the
official
and
public
character
with
which
he
is
sometimes
invested
changes
nothing
in
this
situation
the
fact
that
he
works
openly
does
not
unite
him
more
regularly
or
more
durably
to
those
who
have
recourse
to
his
services
it
is
true
that
in
certain
cases
magicians
form
societies
among
themselves
it
happens
that
they
assemble
more
or
less
periodically
to
celebrate
certain
rites
in
common
it
is
well
known
what
a
place
these
assemblies
of
witches
hold
in
european
but
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
these
associations
are
in
no
way
indispensable
to
the
working
of
the
magic
they
are
even
rare
and
rather
exceptional
the
magician
has
no
need
of
uniting
himself
to
his
fellows
to
practise
his
art
more
frequently
he
is
a
recluse
in
general
far
from
seeking
society
he
flees
it
even
in
regard
to
his
colleagues
he
always
keeps
his
personal
independence
religion
on
the
other
hand
is
inseparable
from
the
idea
of
a
church
from
this
point
of
view
there
is
an
essential
difference
between
magic
and
religion
but
what
is
especially
important
is
that
when
these
societies
of
magic
are
formed
they
do
not
include
all
the
adherents
to
magic
but
only
the
magicians
the
laymen
if
they
may
be
so
called
that
is
to
say
those
for
whose
profit
the
rites
are
celebrated
in
fine
those
who
represent
the
worshippers
in
the
regular
cults
are
excluded
now
the
magician
is
for
magic
what
the
priest
is
for
religion
but
a
college
of
priests
is
not
a
church
any
more
than
a
religious
congregation
which
should
devote
itself
to
some
particular
saint
in
the
shadow
of
a
cloister
would
be
a
particular
cult
a
church
is
not
a
fraternity
of
priests
it
is
a
moral
community
formed
by
all
the
believers
in
a
single
faith
laymen
as
well
as
priests
but
magic
lacks
any
such
community
but
if
the
idea
of
a
church
is
made
to
enter
into
the
definition
of
religion
does
that
not
exclude
the
private
religions
which
the
individual
establishes
for
himself
and
celebrates
by
himself
there
is
scarcely
a
society
where
these
are
not
found
every
ojibway
as
we
shall
see
below
has
his
own
personal
which
he
chooses
himself
and
to
which
he
renders
special
religious
services
the
melanesian
of
the
banks
islands
has
his
the
roman
his
the
christian
his
patron
saint
and
guardian
angel
etc
by
definition
all
these
cults
seem
to
be
independent
of
all
idea
of
the
group
not
only
are
these
individual
religions
very
frequent
in
history
but
nowadays
many
are
asking
if
they
are
not
destined
to
be
the
form
of
the
religious
life
and
if
the
day
will
not
come
when
there
will
be
no
other
cult
than
that
which
each
man
will
freely
perform
within
himself
but
if
we
leave
these
speculations
in
regard
to
the
future
aside
for
the
moment
and
confine
ourselves
to
religions
such
as
they
are
at
present
or
have
been
in
the
past
it
becomes
clearly
evident
that
these
individual
cults
are
not
distinct
and
autonomous
religious
systems
but
merely
aspects
of
the
common
religion
of
the
whole
church
of
which
the
individuals
are
members
the
patron
saint
of
the
christian
is
chosen
from
the
official
list
of
saints
recognized
by
the
catholic
church
there
are
even
canonical
rules
prescribing
how
each
catholic
should
perform
this
private
cult
in
the
same
way
the
idea
that
each
man
necessarily
has
a
protecting
genius
is
found
under
different
forms
at
the
basis
of
a
great
number
of
american
religions
as
well
as
of
the
roman
religion
to
cite
only
these
two
examples
for
as
will
be
seen
later
it
is
very
closely
connected
with
the
idea
of
the
soul
and
this
idea
of
the
soul
is
not
one
of
those
which
can
be
left
entirely
to
individual
choice
in
a
word
it
is
the
church
of
which
he
is
a
member
which
teaches
the
individual
what
these
personal
gods
are
what
their
function
is
how
he
should
enter
into
relations
with
them
and
how
he
should
honour
them
when
a
methodical
analysis
is
made
of
the
doctrines
of
any
church
whatsoever
sooner
or
later
we
come
upon
those
concerning
private
cults
so
these
are
not
two
religions
of
different
types
and
turned
in
opposite
directions
both
are
made
up
of
the
same
ideas
and
the
same
principles
here
applied
to
circumstances
which
are
of
interest
to
the
group
as
a
whole
there
to
the
life
of
the
individual
this
solidarity
is
even
so
close
that
among
certain
peoples
the
ceremonies
by
which
the
faithful
first
enter
into
communication
with
their
protecting
geniuses
are
mixed
with
rites
whose
public
character
is
incontestable
namely
the
rites
of
initiation
there
still
remain
those
contemporary
aspirations
towards
a
religion
which
would
consist
entirely
in
internal
and
subjective
states
and
which
would
be
constructed
freely
by
each
of
us
but
howsoever
real
these
aspirations
may
be
they
can
not
affect
our
definition
for
this
is
to
be
applied
only
to
facts
already
realized
and
not
to
uncertain
possibilities
one
can
define
religions
such
as
they
are
or
such
as
they
have
been
but
not
such
as
they
more
or
less
vaguely
tend
to
become
it
is
possible
that
this
religious
individualism
is
destined
to
be
realized
in
facts
but
before
we
can
say
just
how
far
this
may
be
the
case
we
must
first
know
what
religion
is
of
what
elements
it
is
made
up
from
what
causes
it
results
and
what
function
it
fulfils
all
questions
whose
solution
can
not
be
foreseen
before
the
threshold
of
our
study
has
been
passed
it
is
only
at
the
close
of
this
study
that
we
can
attempt
to
anticipate
the
future
thus
we
arrive
at
the
following
definition
religion
is
a
unified
system
of
beliefs
and
practices
relative
to
sacred
things
that
is
to
say
things
set
apart
and
forbidden
beliefs
and
practices
which
unite
into
one
single
moral
community
called
a
church
all
those
who
adhere
to
the
second
element
which
thus
finds
a
place
in
our
definition
is
no
less
essential
than
the
first
for
by
showing
that
the
idea
of
religion
is
inseparable
from
that
of
the
church
it
makes
it
clear
that
religion
should
be
an
eminently
collective
thing
chapter
ii
leading
conceptions
of
the
elementary
religion
armed
with
this
definition
we
are
now
able
to
set
out
in
search
of
this
elementary
religion
which
we
propose
to
study
even
the
crudest
religions
with
which
history
and
ethnology
make
us
acquainted
are
already
of
a
complexity
which
corresponds
badly
with
the
idea
sometimes
held
of
primitive
mentality
one
finds
there
not
only
a
confused
system
of
beliefs
and
rites
but
also
such
a
plurality
of
different
principles
and
such
a
richness
of
essential
notions
that
it
seems
impossible
to
see
in
them
anything
but
the
late
product
of
a
rather
long
evolution
hence
it
has
been
concluded
that
to
discover
the
truly
original
form
of
the
religious
life
it
is
necessary
to
descend
by
analysis
beyond
these
observable
religions
to
resolve
them
into
their
common
and
fundamental
elements
and
then
to
seek
among
these
latter
some
one
from
which
the
others
were
derived
to
the
problem
thus
stated
two
contrary
solutions
have
been
given
there
is
no
religious
system
ancient
or
recent
where
one
does
not
meet
under
different
forms
two
religions
as
it
were
side
by
side
which
though
being
united
closely
and
mutually
penetrating
each
other
do
not
cease
nevertheless
to
be
distinct
the
one
addresses
itself
to
the
phenomena
of
nature
either
the
great
cosmic
forces
such
as
winds
rivers
stars
or
the
sky
or
else
the
objects
of
various
sorts
which
cover
the
surface
of
the
earth
such
as
plants
animals
rocks
etc
for
this
reason
it
has
been
given
the
name
of
the
other
has
spiritual
beings
as
its
object
spirits
souls
geniuses
demons
divinities
properly
animated
and
conscious
agents
like
man
but
distinguished
from
him
nevertheless
by
the
nature
of
their
powers
and
especially
by
the
peculiar
characteristic
that
they
do
not
affect
the
senses
in
the
same
way
ordinarily
they
are
not
visible
to
human
eyes
this
religion
of
spirits
is
called
now
to
explain
the
universal
of
these
two
sorts
of
cults
two
contradictory
theories
have
been
proposed
for
some
animism
is
the
primitive
religion
of
which
naturism
is
only
a
secondary
and
derived
form
for
the
others
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
nature
cult
which
was
the
point
of
departure
for
religious
evolution
the
cult
of
spirits
is
only
a
peculiar
case
of
that
these
two
theories
are
up
to
the
present
the
only
ones
by
which
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
explain
rationally
the
origins
of
religious
thought
thus
the
capital
problem
raised
by
the
history
of
religions
is
generally
reduced
to
asking
which
of
these
two
solutions
should
be
chosen
or
whether
it
is
not
better
to
combine
them
and
in
that
case
what
place
must
be
given
to
each
of
the
two
elements
even
those
scholars
who
do
not
admit
either
of
these
hypotheses
in
their
systematic
form
do
not
refuse
to
retain
certain
propositions
upon
which
they
rest
thus
we
have
a
certain
number
of
theories
already
made
which
must
be
submitted
to
criticism
before
we
take
up
the
study
of
the
facts
for
ourselves
it
will
be
better
understood
how
indispensable
it
is
to
attempt
a
new
one
when
we
have
seen
the
insufficiency
of
these
traditional
conceptions
i
it
is
tylor
who
formed
the
animist
theory
in
its
essential
outlines
spencer
who
took
it
up
after
him
did
not
reproduce
it
without
introducing
certain
modifications
but
in
general
the
questions
are
posed
by
each
in
the
same
terms
and
the
solutions
accepted
are
with
a
single
exception
identically
the
same
therefore
we
can
unite
these
two
doctrines
in
the
exposition
which
follows
if
we
mark
at
the
proper
moment
the
place
where
the
two
diverge
from
one
another
in
order
to
find
the
elementary
form
of
the
religious
life
in
these
animistic
beliefs
and
practices
three
must
be
satisfied
first
since
according
to
this
hypothesis
the
idea
of
the
soul
is
the
cardinal
idea
of
religion
it
must
be
shown
how
this
is
formed
without
taking
any
of
its
elements
from
an
anterior
religion
secondly
it
must
be
made
clear
how
souls
become
the
object
of
a
cult
and
are
transformed
into
spirits
and
thirdly
and
finally
since
the
cult
of
these
spirits
is
not
all
of
any
religion
it
remains
to
be
explained
how
the
cult
of
nature
is
derived
from
it
according
to
this
theory
the
idea
of
the
soul
was
first
suggested
to
men
by
the
badly
understood
spectacle
of
the
double
life
they
ordinarily
lead
on
the
one
hand
when
awake
on
the
other
when
asleep
in
fact
for
the
savage
the
mental
representations
which
he
has
while
awake
and
those
of
his
dreams
are
said
to
be
of
the
same
value
he
objectifies
the
second
like
the
first
that
is
to
say
that
he
sees
in
them
the
images
of
external
objects
whose
appearance
they
more
or
less
accurately
reproduce
so
when
he
dreams
that
he
has
visited
a
distant
country
he
believes
that
he
really
was
there
but
he
could
not
have
gone
there
unless
two
beings
exist
within
him
the
one
his
body
which
has
remained
lying
on
the
ground
and
which
he
finds
in
the
same
position
on
awakening
the
other
during
this
time
has
travelled
through
space
similarly
if
he
seems
to
talk
with
one
of
his
companions
who
he
knows
was
really
at
a
distance
he
concludes
that
the
other
also
is
composed
of
two
beings
one
which
sleeps
at
a
distance
and
another
which
has
come
to
manifest
himself
by
means
of
the
dream
from
these
repeated
experiences
he
little
by
little
arrives
at
the
idea
that
each
of
us
has
a
double
another
self
which
in
determined
conditions
has
the
power
of
leaving
the
organism
where
it
resides
and
of
going
roaming
at
a
distance
of
course
this
double
reproduces
all
the
essential
traits
of
the
perceptible
being
which
serves
it
as
external
covering
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
distinguished
from
this
by
many
characteristics
it
is
more
active
since
it
can
cover
vast
distances
in
an
instant
it
is
more
malleable
and
plastic
for
to
leave
the
body
it
must
pass
out
by
its
apertures
especially
the
mouth
and
nose
it
is
represented
as
made
of
matter
undoubtedly
but
of
a
matter
much
more
subtile
and
etherial
than
any
which
we
know
empirically
this
double
is
the
soul
in
fact
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
in
numerous
societies
the
soul
has
been
conceived
in
the
image
of
the
body
it
is
believed
that
it
reproduces
even
the
accidental
deformities
such
as
those
resulting
from
wounds
or
mutilations
certain
australians
after
having
killed
their
enemy
cut
off
his
right
thumb
so
that
his
soul
deprived
of
its
thumb
also
can
not
throw
a
javelin
and
revenge
itself
but
while
it
resembles
the
body
it
has
at
the
same
time
something
half
spiritual
about
it
they
say
that
it
is
the
finer
or
more
aeriform
part
of
the
body
that
it
has
no
flesh
nor
bone
nor
sinew
that
when
one
wishes
to
take
hold
of
it
he
feels
nothing
that
it
is
like
a
purified
body
also
other
facts
of
experience
which
affect
the
mind
in
the
same
way
naturally
group
themselves
around
this
fundamental
fact
taught
by
the
dream
fainting
apoplexy
catalepsy
ecstasy
in
a
word
all
cases
of
temporary
insensibility
in
fact
they
all
are
explained
very
well
by
the
hypothesis
that
the
principle
of
life
and
feeling
is
able
to
leave
the
body
momentarily
also
it
is
natural
that
this
principle
should
be
confounded
with
the
double
since
the
absence
of
the
double
during
sleep
daily
has
the
effect
of
suspending
thought
and
life
thus
diverse
observations
seem
to
agree
mutually
and
to
confirm
the
idea
of
the
constitutional
duality
of
man
but
the
soul
is
not
a
spirit
it
is
attached
to
a
body
which
it
can
leave
only
by
exception
in
so
far
as
it
is
nothing
more
than
that
it
is
not
the
object
of
any
cult
the
spirit
on
the
other
hand
though
generally
having
some
special
thing
as
its
residence
can
go
away
at
will
and
a
man
can
enter
into
relations
with
it
only
by
observing
ritual
precautions
the
soul
can
become
a
spirit
then
only
by
transforming
itself
the
simple
application
of
these
preceding
ideas
to
the
fact
of
death
produced
this
metamorphosis
quite
naturally
for
a
rudimentary
intelligence
in
fact
death
is
not
distinguished
from
a
long
fainting
swoon
or
a
prolonged
sleep
it
has
all
their
aspects
thus
it
seems
that
it
too
consists
in
a
separation
of
the
soul
and
the
body
analogous
to
that
produced
every
night
but
as
in
such
cases
the
body
is
not
reanimated
the
idea
is
formed
of
a
separation
without
an
assignable
limit
of
time
when
the
body
is
once
destroyed
and
funeral
rites
have
the
object
of
hastening
this
destruction
the
separation
is
taken
as
final
hence
come
spirits
detached
from
any
organism
and
left
free
in
space
as
their
number
augments
with
time
a
population
of
souls
forms
around
the
living
population
these
souls
of
men
have
the
needs
and
passions
of
men
they
seek
to
concern
themselves
with
the
life
of
their
companions
of
yesterday
either
to
aid
them
or
to
injure
them
according
to
the
sentiments
which
they
have
kept
towards
them
according
to
the
circumstances
their
nature
makes
them
either
very
precious
auxiliaries
or
very
redoubtable
adversaries
owing
to
their
extreme
fluidity
they
can
even
enter
into
the
body
and
cause
all
sorts
of
disorders
there
or
else
increase
its
vitality
thus
comes
the
habit
of
attributing
to
them
all
those
events
of
life
which
vary
slightly
from
the
ordinary
there
are
very
few
of
these
for
which
they
can
not
account
thus
they
constitute
a
sort
of
supply
of
causes
which
never
leaves
one
at
a
loss
when
in
search
of
explanations
does
a
man
appear
inspired
does
he
speak
with
energy
is
it
as
though
he
were
lifted
outside
himself
and
above
the
ordinary
level
of
men
it
is
because
a
good
spirit
is
in
him
and
animates
him
is
he
overtaken
by
an
attack
or
seized
by
madness
it
is
because
an
evil
spirit
has
entered
into
him
and
brought
him
all
this
trouble
there
are
no
maladies
which
can
not
be
assigned
to
some
influence
of
this
sort
thus
the
power
of
souls
is
increased
by
all
that
men
attribute
to
them
and
in
the
end
men
find
themselves
the
prisoners
of
this
imaginary
world
of
which
they
are
however
the
authors
and
the
models
they
fall
into
dependence
upon
these
spiritual
forces
which
they
have
created
with
their
own
hands
and
in
their
own
image
for
if
souls
are
the
givers
of
health
and
sickness
of
goods
and
evils
to
this
extent
it
is
wise
to
conciliate
their
favour
or
appease
them
when
they
are
irritated
hence
come
the
offerings
prayers
sacrifices
in
a
word
all
the
apparatus
of
religious
observances
here
is
the
soul
transformed
from
a
simple
vital
principle
animating
the
body
of
a
man
it
has
become
a
spirit
a
good
or
evil
genius
or
even
a
deity
according
to
the
importance
of
the
effects
with
which
it
is
charged
but
since
it
is
death
which
brought
about
this
apotheosis
it
is
to
the
dead
to
the
souls
of
ancestors
that
the
first
cult
known
to
humanity
was
addressed
thus
the
first
rites
were
funeral
rites
the
first
sacrifices
were
food
offerings
destined
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
departed
the
first
altars
were
tombs
but
since
these
spirits
were
of
human
origin
they
interested
themselves
only
in
the
life
of
men
and
were
thought
to
act
only
upon
human
events
it
is
still
to
be
explained
how
other
spirits
were
imagined
to
account
for
the
other
phenomena
of
the
universe
and
how
the
cult
of
nature
was
subsequently
formed
beside
that
of
the
ancestors
for
tylor
this
extension
of
animism
was
due
to
the
particular
mentality
of
the
primitive
who
like
an
infant
can
not
distinguish
the
animate
and
the
inanimate
since
the
first
beings
of
which
the
child
commences
to
have
an
idea
are
men
that
is
himself
and
those
around
him
it
is
upon
this
model
of
human
nature
that
he
tends
to
think
of
everything
the
toys
with
which
he
plays
or
the
objects
of
every
sort
which
affect
his
senses
he
regards
as
living
beings
like
himself
now
the
primitive
thinks
like
a
child
consequently
he
also
is
inclined
to
endow
all
things
even
inanimate
ones
with
a
nature
analogous
to
his
own
then
if
for
the
reasons
exposed
above
he
once
arrives
at
the
idea
that
man
is
a
body
animated
by
a
spirit
he
must
necessarily
attribute
a
duality
of
this
sort
and
souls
like
his
own
even
to
inert
bodies
themselves
yet
the
sphere
of
action
of
the
two
could
not
be
the
same
the
souls
of
men
have
a
direct
influence
only
upon
the
world
of
men
they
have
a
marked
preference
for
the
human
organism
even
when
death
has
given
them
their
liberty
on
the
other
hand
the
souls
of
things
reside
especially
in
these
things
and
are
regarded
as
the
productive
causes
of
all
that
passes
there
the
first
account
for
health
and
sickness
skilfulness
or
unskilfulness
etc
by
the
second
are
explained
especially
the
phenomena
of
the
physical
world
the
movement
of
or
the
stars
the
germination
of
plants
the
reproduction
of
animals
etc
thus
the
first
philosophy
of
man
which
is
at
the
basis
of
the
is
completed
by
a
philosophy
of
the
world
in
regard
to
these
cosmic
spirits
man
finds
himself
in
a
state
of
dependence
still
more
evident
than
that
in
regard
to
the
wandering
doubles
of
his
ancestors
for
he
could
have
only
ideal
and
imaginary
relations
with
the
latter
but
he
depends
upon
things
in
reality
to
live
he
has
need
of
their
concurrence
he
then
believes
that
he
has
an
equal
need
of
the
spirits
which
appear
to
animate
these
things
and
to
determine
their
diverse
manifestations
he
implores
their
assistance
he
solicits
them
with
offerings
and
prayers
and
the
religion
of
man
is
thus
completed
in
a
religion
of
nature
herbert
spencer
objects
against
this
explanation
that
the
hypothesis
upon
which
it
rests
is
contradicted
by
the
facts
it
is
held
he
says
that
there
is
a
time
when
men
do
not
realize
the
differences
which
separate
the
animate
from
the
inanimate
now
as
one
advances
in
the
animal
scale
he
sees
the
ability
to
make
this
distinction
develop
the
superior
animals
do
not
confound
an
object
which
moves
of
itself
and
whose
movements
are
adapted
to
certain
ends
with
those
which
are
mechanically
moved
from
without
amusing
herself
with
a
mouse
she
has
caught
the
cat
if
it
remains
long
stationary
touches
it
with
her
paw
to
make
it
run
obviously
the
thought
is
that
a
living
thing
disturbed
will
try
to
escape
even
the
primitive
men
could
not
have
an
intelligence
inferior
to
that
of
the
animals
which
preceded
them
in
evolution
then
it
can
not
be
for
lack
of
discernment
that
they
passed
from
the
cult
of
ancestors
to
the
cult
of
things
according
to
spencer
who
upon
this
point
but
upon
this
point
only
differs
from
tylor
this
passage
was
certainly
due
to
a
confusion
but
to
one
of
a
different
sort
it
was
in
a
large
part
at
least
the
result
of
numerous
errors
due
to
language
in
many
inferior
societies
it
is
a
very
common
custom
to
give
to
each
individual
either
at
his
birth
or
later
the
name
of
some
animal
plant
star
or
natural
object
but
as
a
consequence
of
the
extreme
imprecision
of
his
language
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
primitive
to
distinguish
a
metaphor
from
the
reality
he
soon
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
these
names
were
only
figures
and
taking
them
literally
he
ended
by
believing
that
an
ancestor
named
tiger
or
lion
was
really
a
tiger
or
a
lion
then
the
cult
of
which
the
ancestor
was
the
object
up
to
that
time
was
changed
over
to
the
animal
with
which
he
was
thereafter
confounded
and
as
the
same
substitution
went
on
for
the
plants
the
stars
and
all
the
natural
phenomena
the
religion
of
nature
took
the
place
of
the
old
religion
of
the
dead
besides
this
fundamental
confusion
spencer
signalizes
others
which
aided
the
action
of
the
first
from
time
to
time
for
example
the
animals
which
frequent
the
surroundings
of
the
tombs
or
houses
of
men
have
been
taken
for
their
reincarnated
souls
and
adored
under
this
title
or
again
the
mountain
which
tradition
made
the
cradle
of
the
race
was
finally
taken
for
the
ancestor
of
the
race
it
was
thought
that
men
were
descended
from
it
because
their
ancestors
appeared
coming
from
it
and
it
was
consequently
treated
as
an
ancestor
itself
but
according
to
the
statement
of
spencer
these
accessory
causes
had
only
a
secondary
influence
that
which
principally
determined
the
institution
of
naturism
was
the
literal
interpretation
of
metaphorical
names
we
had
to
mention
this
theory
to
have
our
exposition
of
animism
complete
but
it
is
too
inadequate
for
the
facts
and
too
universally
abandoned
to
demand
that
we
stop
any
longer
for
it
in
order
to
explain
a
fact
as
general
as
the
religion
of
nature
by
an
illusion
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
illusion
invoked
should
have
causes
of
an
equal
generality
now
even
if
misunderstandings
such
as
those
of
which
spencer
gives
some
rare
illustrations
could
explain
the
transformation
of
the
cult
of
ancestors
into
that
of
nature
it
is
not
clear
why
this
should
be
produced
with
a
sort
of
universality
no
psychical
mechanism
necessitated
it
it
is
true
that
because
of
its
ambiguity
the
word
might
lead
to
an
equivocation
but
on
the
other
hand
all
the
personal
souvenirs
left
by
the
ancestor
in
the
memories
of
men
should
oppose
this
confusion
why
should
the
tradition
which
represented
the
ancestor
such
as
he
really
was
that
is
to
say
as
a
man
who
led
the
life
of
a
man
everywhere
give
way
before
the
prestige
of
a
word
likewise
one
should
have
a
little
difficulty
in
admitting
that
men
were
born
of
a
mountain
or
a
star
of
an
animal
or
a
plant
the
idea
of
a
similar
exception
to
the
ordinary
conceptions
of
generation
could
not
fail
to
raise
active
resistance
thus
it
is
far
from
true
that
the
error
found
a
road
all
prepared
before
it
but
rather
all
sorts
of
reasons
should
have
kept
it
from
being
accepted
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
in
spite
of
all
these
obstacles
it
could
have
triumphed
so
generally
ii
the
theory
of
tylor
whose
authority
is
always
great
still
remains
his
hypotheses
on
the
dream
and
the
origin
of
the
ideas
of
the
soul
and
of
spirits
are
still
classic
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
test
their
value
first
of
all
it
should
be
recognized
that
the
theorists
of
animism
have
rendered
an
important
service
to
the
science
of
religions
and
even
to
the
general
history
of
ideas
by
submitting
the
idea
of
the
soul
to
historical
analysis
instead
of
following
so
many
philosophers
and
making
it
a
simple
and
immediate
object
of
consciousness
they
have
much
more
correctly
viewed
it
as
a
complex
whole
a
product
of
history
and
mythology
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
it
is
something
essentially
religious
in
its
nature
origin
and
functions
it
is
from
religion
that
the
philosophers
received
it
it
is
impossible
to
understand
the
form
in
which
it
is
represented
by
the
thinkers
of
antiquity
if
one
does
not
take
into
account
the
mythical
elements
which
served
in
its
formation
but
if
tylor
has
had
the
merit
of
raising
this
problem
the
solution
he
gives
raises
grave
difficulties
first
of
all
there
are
reservations
to
be
made
in
regard
to
the
very
principle
which
is
at
the
basis
of
this
theory
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
the
soul
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
body
that
it
is
its
double
and
that
within
it
or
outside
of
it
it
normally
lives
its
own
autonomous
life
now
we
shall
see
that
this
conception
is
not
that
of
the
primitive
or
at
least
that
it
only
expresses
one
aspect
of
his
idea
of
the
soul
for
him
the
soul
though
being
under
certain
conditions
independent
of
the
organism
which
it
animates
confounds
itself
with
this
latter
to
such
an
extent
that
it
can
not
be
radically
separated
from
it
there
are
organs
which
are
not
only
its
appointed
seat
but
also
its
outward
form
and
material
manifestation
the
notion
is
therefore
more
complex
than
the
doctrine
supposes
and
it
is
doubtful
consequently
whether
the
experiences
mentioned
are
sufficient
to
account
for
it
for
even
if
they
did
enable
us
to
understand
how
men
have
come
to
believe
themselves
double
they
can
not
explain
how
this
duality
does
not
exclude
but
rather
implies
a
deeper
unity
and
an
intimate
interpenetration
of
the
two
beings
thus
differentiated
but
let
us
admit
that
the
idea
of
the
soul
can
be
reduced
to
the
idea
of
a
double
and
then
see
how
this
latter
came
to
be
formed
it
could
not
have
been
suggested
to
men
except
by
the
experience
of
dreams
that
they
might
understand
how
they
could
see
places
more
or
less
distant
during
sleep
while
their
bodies
remained
lying
on
the
ground
it
would
seem
that
they
were
led
to
conceive
of
themselves
as
two
beings
on
the
one
hand
the
body
and
on
the
other
a
second
self
able
to
leave
the
organism
in
which
it
lives
and
to
roam
about
in
space
but
if
this
hypothesis
of
a
double
is
to
be
able
to
impose
itself
upon
men
with
a
sort
of
necessity
it
should
be
the
only
one
possible
or
at
least
the
most
economical
one
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
more
simple
ones
which
it
would
seem
might
have
occurred
to
the
mind
just
as
naturally
for
example
why
should
the
sleeper
not
imagine
that
while
asleep
he
is
able
to
see
things
at
a
distance
to
imagine
such
a
power
would
demand
less
expense
to
the
imagination
than
the
construction
of
this
complex
notion
of
a
double
made
of
some
etherial
substance
and
of
which
direct
experience
offers
no
example
but
even
supposing
that
certain
dreams
rather
naturally
suggest
the
animistic
explanation
there
are
certainly
many
others
which
are
absolutely
incompatible
with
it
often
our
dreams
are
concerned
with
passed
events
we
see
again
the
things
which
we
saw
or
did
yesterday
or
the
day
before
or
even
during
our
youth
etc
dreams
of
this
sort
are
frequent
and
hold
a
rather
considerable
place
in
our
nocturnal
life
but
the
idea
of
a
double
can
not
account
for
them
even
if
the
double
can
go
from
one
point
to
another
in
space
it
is
not
clear
how
it
could
possibly
go
back
and
forth
in
time
howsoever
rudimentary
his
intelligence
may
be
how
could
a
man
on
awakening
believe
that
he
had
really
been
assisting
at
or
taking
part
in
events
which
he
knows
passed
long
before
how
could
he
imagine
that
during
his
sleep
he
lived
a
life
which
he
knows
has
long
since
gone
by
it
would
be
much
more
natural
that
he
should
regard
these
renewed
images
as
merely
what
they
really
are
that
is
as
souvenirs
like
those
which
he
has
during
the
day
but
ones
of
a
special
intensity
moreover
in
the
scenes
of
which
we
are
the
actors
and
witnesses
while
we
sleep
it
constantly
happens
that
one
of
our
contemporaries
has
a
rôle
as
well
as
ourselves
we
think
we
see
and
hear
him
in
the
same
place
where
we
see
ourselves
according
to
the
animists
the
primitive
would
explain
this
by
imagining
that
his
double
was
visited
by
or
met
with
those
of
certain
of
his
companions
but
it
would
be
enough
that
on
awakening
he
question
them
to
find
that
their
experiences
do
not
coincide
with
his
during
this
same
time
they
too
have
had
dreams
but
wholly
different
ones
they
have
not
seen
themselves
participating
in
the
same
scene
they
believe
that
they
have
visited
wholly
different
places
since
such
contradictions
should
be
the
rule
in
these
cases
why
should
they
not
lead
men
to
believe
that
there
had
probably
been
an
error
that
they
had
merely
imagined
it
that
they
had
been
duped
by
illusions
this
blind
credulity
which
is
attributed
to
the
primitive
is
really
too
simple
it
is
not
true
that
he
must
objectify
all
his
sensations
he
can
not
live
long
without
perceiving
that
even
when
awake
his
senses
sometimes
deceive
him
then
why
should
he
believe
them
more
infallible
at
night
than
during
the
day
thus
we
find
that
there
are
many
reasons
opposing
the
theory
that
he
takes
his
dreams
for
the
reality
and
interprets
them
by
means
of
a
double
of
himself
but
more
than
that
even
if
every
dream
were
well
explained
by
the
hypothesis
of
a
double
and
could
not
be
explained
otherwise
it
would
remain
a
question
why
men
have
attempted
to
explain
them
dreams
undoubtedly
constitute
the
matter
of
a
possible
problem
but
we
pass
by
problems
every
day
which
we
do
not
raise
and
of
which
we
have
no
suspicion
until
some
circumstance
makes
us
feel
the
necessity
of
raising
them
even
when
the
taste
for
pure
speculation
is
aroused
reflection
is
far
from
raising
all
the
problems
to
which
it
could
eventually
apply
itself
only
those
attract
it
which
present
a
particular
interest
especially
when
it
is
a
question
of
facts
which
always
take
place
in
the
same
manner
habit
easily
numbs
curiosity
and
we
do
not
even
dream
of
questioning
them
to
shake
off
this
torpor
it
is
necessary
that
practical
exigencies
or
at
least
a
very
pressing
theoretical
interest
stimulate
our
attention
and
turn
it
in
this
direction
that
is
why
at
every
moment
of
history
there
have
been
so
many
things
that
we
have
not
tried
to
understand
without
even
being
conscious
of
our
renunciation
up
until
very
recent
times
it
was
believed
that
the
sun
was
only
a
few
feet
in
diameter
there
is
something
incomprehensible
in
the
statement
that
a
luminous
disc
of
such
slight
dimensions
could
illuminate
the
world
yet
for
centuries
men
never
thought
of
resolving
this
contradiction
the
fact
of
heredity
has
been
known
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
very
recently
that
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
formulate
its
theory
certain
beliefs
were
even
admitted
which
rendered
it
wholly
unintelligible
thus
in
many
australian
societies
of
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
the
child
is
not
physiologically
the
offspring
of
its
parents
this
intellectual
laziness
is
necessarily
at
its
maximum
among
the
primitive
peoples
these
weak
beings
who
have
so
much
trouble
in
maintaining
life
against
all
the
forces
which
assail
it
have
no
means
for
supporting
any
luxury
in
the
way
of
speculation
they
do
not
reflect
except
when
they
are
driven
to
it
now
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
could
have
led
them
to
make
dreams
the
theme
of
their
meditations
what
does
the
dream
amount
to
in
our
lives
how
little
is
the
place
it
holds
especially
because
of
the
very
vague
impressions
it
leaves
in
the
memory
and
of
the
rapidity
with
which
it
is
effaced
from
remembrance
and
consequently
how
surprising
it
is
that
a
man
of
so
rudimentary
an
intelligence
should
have
expended
such
efforts
to
find
its
explanation
of
the
two
existences
which
he
successively
leads
that
of
the
day
and
that
of
the
night
it
is
the
first
which
should
interest
him
the
most
is
it
not
strange
that
the
second
should
have
so
captivated
his
attention
that
he
made
it
the
basis
of
a
whole
system
of
complicated
ideas
destined
to
have
so
profound
an
influence
upon
his
thought
and
conduct
thus
all
tends
to
show
that
in
spite
of
the
credit
it
still
enjoys
the
animistic
theory
of
the
soul
must
be
revised
it
is
true
that
the
primitive
attributes
his
dreams
or
at
least
certain
of
them
to
displacements
of
his
double
but
that
does
not
say
that
the
dream
actually
furnished
the
materials
out
of
which
the
idea
of
the
double
or
the
soul
was
first
constructed
it
might
have
been
applied
afterwards
to
the
phenomena
of
dreams
ecstasy
and
possession
without
having
been
derived
from
them
it
is
very
frequent
that
after
it
has
been
formed
an
idea
is
employed
to
or
illuminate
with
a
light
frequently
more
apparent
than
real
certain
facts
with
which
it
had
no
relation
at
first
and
which
would
never
have
suggested
it
themselves
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
are
frequently
proven
by
showing
that
these
beliefs
are
implied
in
the
fundamental
principles
of
morality
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
quite
another
origin
the
history
of
religious
thought
could
furnish
numerous
examples
of
these
retrospective
justifications
which
can
teach
us
nothing
of
the
way
in
which
the
ideas
were
formed
nor
of
the
elements
out
of
which
they
are
composed
it
is
also
probable
that
the
primitive
distinguishes
between
his
dreams
and
does
not
interpret
them
all
in
the
same
way
in
our
european
societies
the
still
numerous
persons
for
whom
sleep
is
a
sort
of
state
in
which
the
mind
being
partially
relieved
of
the
body
has
a
sharpness
of
vision
which
it
does
not
enjoy
during
waking
moments
do
not
go
to
the
point
of
considering
all
their
dreams
as
so
many
mystic
intuitions
on
the
contrary
along
with
everybody
else
they
see
in
the
majority
of
their
dreams
only
profane
conditions
vain
plays
of
images
or
simple
hallucinations
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
primitive
should
make
analogous
distinctions
codrington
says
distinctly
that
the
melanesians
do
not
attribute
all
their
dreams
indiscriminately
to
the
wanderings
of
their
souls
but
merely
those
which
strike
their
imagination
forcibly
undoubtedly
by
that
should
be
understood
those
in
which
the
sleeper
imagines
himself
in
relations
with
religious
beings
good
or
evil
geniuses
souls
of
the
dead
etc
similarly
the
dieri
in
australia
sharply
distinguish
ordinary
dreams
from
those
nocturnal
visions
in
which
some
deceased
friend
or
relative
shows
himself
to
them
in
the
first
they
see
a
simple
fantasy
of
their
imagination
they
attribute
the
second
to
the
action
of
an
evil
spirit
all
the
facts
which
howitt
mentions
as
examples
to
show
how
the
australian
attributes
to
the
soul
the
power
of
leaving
the
body
have
an
equally
mystic
character
the
sleeper
believes
himself
transported
into
the
land
of
the
dead
or
else
he
converses
with
a
dead
companion
these
dreams
are
frequent
among
the
primitives
it
is
probably
upon
these
facts
that
the
theory
is
based
to
account
for
them
it
is
admitted
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
come
back
to
the
living
during
their
sleep
this
theory
was
the
more
readily
accepted
because
no
fact
of
experience
could
invalidate
it
but
these
dreams
were
possible
only
where
the
ideas
of
spirits
souls
and
a
land
of
the
dead
were
already
existent
that
is
to
say
where
religious
evolution
was
relatively
advanced
thus
far
from
having
been
able
to
furnish
to
religion
the
fundamental
notion
upon
which
it
rests
they
suppose
a
previous
religious
system
upon
which
they
depended
iii
we
now
arrive
at
that
which
constitutes
the
very
heart
of
the
doctrine
wherever
this
idea
of
a
double
may
come
from
it
is
not
sufficient
according
to
the
avowal
of
the
animists
themselves
to
explain
the
formation
of
the
cult
of
the
ancestors
which
they
would
make
the
initial
type
of
all
religions
if
this
double
is
to
become
the
object
of
a
cult
it
must
cease
to
be
a
simple
reproduction
of
the
individual
and
must
acquire
the
characteristics
necessary
to
put
it
in
the
rank
of
sacred
beings
it
is
death
they
say
which
performs
this
transformation
but
whence
comes
the
virtue
which
they
attribute
to
this
even
were
the
analogy
of
sleep
and
death
sufficient
to
make
one
believe
that
the
soul
survives
the
body
and
there
are
reservations
to
be
made
on
this
point
why
does
this
soul
by
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
now
detached
from
the
organism
so
completely
change
its
nature
if
it
was
only
a
profane
thing
a
wandering
vital
principle
during
life
how
does
it
become
a
sacred
thing
all
at
once
and
the
object
of
religious
sentiments
death
adds
nothing
essential
to
it
except
a
greater
liberty
of
movement
being
no
longer
attached
to
a
special
residence
from
now
on
it
can
do
at
any
time
what
it
formerly
did
only
by
night
but
the
action
of
which
it
is
capable
is
always
of
the
same
sort
then
why
have
the
living
considered
this
uprooted
and
vagabond
double
of
their
former
companion
as
anything
more
than
an
equal
it
was
a
whose
approach
might
be
inconvenient
it
was
not
a
divinity
it
seems
as
though
death
ought
to
have
the
effect
of
weakening
vital
energies
instead
of
strengthening
them
it
is
in
fact
a
very
common
belief
in
the
inferior
societies
that
the
soul
participates
actively
in
the
life
of
the
body
if
the
body
is
wounded
it
is
wounded
itself
and
in
a
corresponding
place
then
it
should
grow
old
along
with
the
body
in
fact
there
are
peoples
who
do
not
render
funeral
honours
to
men
arrived
at
senility
they
are
treated
as
if
their
souls
also
had
become
senile
it
even
happens
that
they
regularly
put
to
death
before
they
arrive
at
old
age
certain
privileged
persons
such
as
kings
or
priests
who
are
supposed
to
be
the
possessors
of
powerful
spirits
whose
protection
the
community
wishes
to
keep
they
thus
seek
to
keep
the
spirit
from
being
affected
by
the
physical
decadence
of
its
momentary
keepers
with
this
end
in
view
they
take
it
from
the
organism
where
it
resides
before
age
can
have
weakened
it
and
they
transport
it
while
it
has
as
yet
lost
nothing
of
its
vigour
into
a
younger
body
where
it
will
be
able
to
keep
its
vitality
intact
so
when
death
results
from
sickness
or
old
age
it
seems
as
though
the
soul
could
retain
only
a
diminished
power
and
if
it
is
only
its
double
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
it
could
survive
at
all
after
the
body
is
once
definitely
dissolved
from
this
point
of
view
the
idea
of
survival
is
intelligible
only
with
great
difficulty
there
is
a
logical
and
psychological
gap
between
the
idea
of
a
double
at
liberty
and
that
of
a
spirit
to
which
a
cult
is
addressed
this
interval
appears
still
more
considerable
when
we
realize
what
an
abyss
separates
the
sacred
world
from
the
profane
it
becomes
evident
that
a
simple
change
of
degree
could
not
be
enough
to
make
something
pass
from
one
category
into
the
other
sacred
beings
are
not
distinguished
from
profane
ones
merely
by
the
strange
or
disconcerting
forms
which
they
take
or
by
the
greater
powers
which
they
enjoy
between
the
two
there
is
no
common
measure
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
notion
of
a
double
which
could
account
for
so
radical
a
heterogeneity
it
is
said
that
when
once
freed
from
the
body
the
spirit
can
work
all
sorts
of
good
or
evil
for
the
living
according
to
the
way
in
which
it
regards
them
but
it
is
not
enough
that
a
being
should
disturb
his
neighbourhood
to
seem
to
be
of
a
wholly
different
nature
from
those
whose
tranquillity
it
menaces
to
be
sure
in
the
sentiment
which
the
believer
feels
for
the
things
he
adores
there
always
enters
in
some
element
of
reserve
and
fear
but
this
is
a
fear
derived
from
respect
more
than
from
fright
and
where
the
dominating
emotion
is
that
which
inspires
in
men
the
idea
of
majesty
is
essentially
religious
then
we
have
explained
nothing
of
religion
until
we
have
found
whence
this
idea
comes
to
what
it
corresponds
and
what
can
have
aroused
it
in
the
mind
simple
souls
of
men
can
not
become
invested
with
this
character
by
the
simple
fact
of
being
no
longer
incarnate
this
is
clearly
shown
by
an
example
from
melanesia
the
melanesians
believe
that
men
have
souls
which
leave
the
body
at
death
it
then
changes
its
name
and
becomes
what
they
call
a
a
etc
also
they
have
a
cult
of
the
souls
of
the
dead
they
pray
to
them
invoke
them
and
make
offerings
and
sacrifices
to
them
but
every
is
not
the
object
of
these
ritual
practices
only
those
have
this
honour
which
come
from
men
to
whom
public
opinion
attributed
during
life
the
very
special
virtue
which
the
melanesians
call
the
later
on
we
shall
have
occasion
to
fix
precisely
the
meaning
which
this
word
expresses
for
the
time
being
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
it
is
the
distinctive
character
of
every
sacred
being
as
codrington
says
it
is
what
works
to
effect
anything
which
is
beyond
the
ordinary
power
of
men
outside
the
common
processes
of
nature
a
priest
a
sorcerer
or
a
ritual
formula
have
mana
as
well
as
a
sacred
stone
or
spirit
thus
the
only
tindalo
to
which
religious
services
are
rendered
are
those
which
were
already
sacred
of
themselves
when
their
proprietor
was
still
alive
in
regard
to
the
other
souls
which
come
from
ordinary
men
from
the
crowd
of
the
profane
the
same
author
says
that
they
are
nobodies
alike
before
and
after
death
by
itself
death
has
no
deifying
virtue
since
it
brings
about
in
a
more
or
less
complete
and
final
fashion
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
profane
things
it
can
well
reinforce
the
sacred
character
of
the
soul
if
this
already
exists
but
it
can
not
create
it
moreover
if
as
the
hypothesis
of
the
animists
supposes
the
first
sacred
beings
were
really
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
the
first
cult
that
of
the
ancestors
it
should
be
found
that
the
lower
the
societies
examined
are
the
more
the
place
given
to
this
cult
in
the
religious
life
but
it
is
rather
the
contrary
which
is
true
the
ancestral
cult
is
not
greatly
developed
or
even
presented
under
a
characteristic
form
except
in
advanced
societies
like
those
of
china
egypt
or
the
greek
and
latin
cities
on
the
other
hand
it
is
completely
lacking
in
the
australian
societies
which
as
we
shall
see
represent
the
lowest
and
simplest
form
of
social
organization
which
we
know
it
is
true
that
funeral
rites
and
rites
of
mourning
are
found
there
but
these
practices
do
not
constitute
a
cult
though
this
name
has
sometimes
wrongfully
been
given
them
in
reality
a
cult
is
not
a
simple
group
of
ritual
precautions
which
a
man
is
held
to
take
in
certain
circumstances
it
is
a
system
of
diverse
rites
festivals
and
ceremonies
which
have
this
characteristic
that
they
reappear
they
fulfil
the
need
which
the
believer
feels
of
strengthening
and
reaffirming
at
regular
intervals
of
time
the
bond
which
unites
him
to
the
sacred
beings
upon
which
he
depends
that
is
why
one
speaks
of
marriage
rites
but
not
of
a
marriage
cult
of
rites
of
birth
but
not
of
a
cult
of
the
child
it
is
because
the
events
on
the
occasion
of
which
these
rites
take
place
imply
no
periodicity
in
the
same
way
there
is
no
cult
of
the
ancestors
except
when
sacrifices
are
made
on
the
tombs
from
time
to
time
when
libations
are
poured
there
on
certain
more
or
less
specific
dates
or
when
festivals
are
regularly
celebrated
in
honour
of
the
dead
but
the
australian
has
no
relations
of
this
sort
with
his
dead
it
is
true
that
he
must
bury
their
remains
according
to
a
ritual
mourn
for
them
during
a
prescribed
length
of
time
and
in
a
prescribed
manner
and
revenge
them
if
there
is
occasion
to
but
when
he
has
once
accomplished
these
pious
tasks
when
the
bones
are
once
dry
and
the
period
of
mourning
is
once
accomplished
then
all
is
said
and
done
and
the
survivors
have
no
more
duties
towards
their
relatives
who
exist
no
longer
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
way
in
which
the
dead
continue
to
hold
a
place
in
the
lives
of
their
kindred
even
after
the
mourning
is
finished
it
is
sometimes
the
case
that
their
hair
or
certain
of
their
bones
are
kept
because
of
special
virtues
which
are
attached
to
them
but
by
that
time
they
have
ceased
to
exist
as
persons
and
have
fallen
to
the
rank
of
anonymous
and
impersonal
charms
in
this
condition
they
are
the
object
of
no
cult
they
serve
only
for
magical
purposes
however
there
are
certain
australian
tribes
which
periodically
celebrate
rites
in
honour
of
fabulous
ancestors
whom
tradition
places
at
the
beginning
of
time
these
ceremonies
generally
consist
in
a
sort
of
dramatic
representation
in
which
are
rehearsed
the
deeds
which
the
myths
ascribe
to
these
legendary
heroes
but
the
personages
thus
represented
are
not
men
who
after
living
the
life
of
men
have
been
transformed
into
a
sort
of
god
by
the
fact
of
their
death
they
are
considered
to
have
exercised
superhuman
powers
while
alive
to
them
is
attributed
all
that
is
grand
in
the
history
of
the
tribe
or
even
of
the
whole
world
it
is
they
who
in
a
large
measure
made
the
earth
such
as
it
is
and
men
such
as
they
are
the
haloes
with
which
they
are
still
decorated
do
not
come
to
them
merely
from
the
fact
that
they
are
ancestors
that
is
to
say
in
fine
that
they
are
dead
but
rather
from
the
fact
that
a
divine
character
is
and
always
has
been
attributed
to
them
to
use
the
melanesian
expression
it
is
because
they
are
constitutionally
endowed
with
mana
consequently
there
is
nothing
in
these
rites
which
shows
that
death
has
the
slightest
power
of
deification
it
can
not
even
be
correctly
said
of
certain
rites
that
they
form
an
since
they
are
not
addressed
to
ancestors
as
such
in
order
to
have
a
real
cult
of
the
dead
it
is
necessary
that
after
death
real
ancestors
the
relations
whom
men
really
lose
every
day
become
the
object
of
the
cult
let
us
repeat
it
once
more
there
are
no
traces
of
any
such
cult
in
australia
thus
the
cult
which
according
to
this
hypothesis
ought
to
be
the
predominating
one
in
inferior
societies
is
really
nonexistent
there
in
reality
the
australian
is
not
concerned
with
his
dead
except
at
the
moment
of
their
decease
and
during
the
time
which
immediately
follows
yet
these
same
peoples
as
we
shall
see
have
a
very
complex
cult
for
sacred
beings
of
a
wholly
different
nature
which
is
made
up
of
numerous
ceremonies
and
frequently
occupying
weeks
or
even
entire
months
it
can
not
be
admitted
that
the
few
rites
which
the
australian
performs
when
he
happens
to
lose
one
of
his
relatives
were
the
origin
of
these
permanent
cults
which
return
regularly
every
year
and
which
take
up
a
considerable
part
of
his
existence
the
contrast
between
the
two
is
so
great
that
we
may
even
ask
whether
the
first
were
not
rather
derived
from
the
second
and
if
the
souls
of
men
far
from
having
been
the
model
upon
which
the
gods
were
originally
imagined
have
not
rather
been
conceived
from
the
very
first
as
emanations
from
the
divinity
iv
from
the
moment
that
the
cult
of
the
dead
is
shown
not
to
be
primitive
animism
lacks
a
basis
it
would
then
seem
useless
to
discuss
the
third
thesis
of
the
system
which
concerns
the
transformation
of
the
cult
of
the
dead
into
the
cult
of
nature
but
since
the
postulate
upon
which
it
rests
is
also
found
in
certain
historians
of
religion
who
do
not
admit
the
animism
properly
such
as
brinton
lang
réville
and
even
robertson
smith
himself
it
is
necessary
to
make
an
examination
of
it
this
extension
of
the
cult
of
the
dead
to
all
nature
is
said
to
come
from
the
fact
that
we
instinctively
tend
to
represent
all
things
in
our
own
image
that
is
to
say
as
living
and
thinking
beings
we
have
seen
that
spencer
has
already
contested
the
reality
of
this
instinct
since
animals
clearly
distinguish
living
bodies
from
dead
ones
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
man
the
heir
of
the
animals
should
not
have
had
this
same
faculty
of
discernment
from
the
very
first
but
howsoever
certain
the
facts
cited
by
spencer
may
be
they
have
not
the
demonstrative
value
which
he
attributes
to
them
his
reasoning
supposes
that
all
the
faculties
instincts
and
aptitudes
of
the
animal
have
passed
integrally
into
man
now
many
errors
have
their
origin
in
this
principle
which
is
wrongfully
taken
as
a
proven
truth
for
example
since
sexual
jealousy
is
generally
very
strong
among
the
higher
animals
it
has
been
concluded
that
it
ought
to
be
found
among
men
with
the
same
intensity
from
the
very
beginnings
of
history
but
it
is
well
known
that
men
can
practise
a
sexual
communism
which
would
be
impossible
if
this
jealousy
were
not
capable
of
attenuating
itself
and
even
of
disappearing
when
necessary
the
fact
is
that
man
is
not
merely
an
animal
with
certain
additional
qualities
he
is
something
else
human
nature
is
the
result
of
a
sort
of
recasting
of
the
animal
nature
and
in
the
course
of
the
various
complex
operations
which
have
brought
about
this
recasting
there
have
been
losses
as
well
as
gains
how
many
instincts
have
we
not
lost
the
reason
for
this
is
that
men
are
not
only
in
relations
with
the
physical
environment
but
also
with
a
social
environment
infinitely
more
extended
more
stable
and
more
active
than
the
one
whose
influence
animals
undergo
to
live
they
must
adapt
themselves
to
this
now
in
order
to
maintain
itself
society
frequently
finds
it
necessary
that
we
should
see
things
from
a
certain
angle
and
feel
them
in
a
certain
way
consequently
it
modifies
the
ideas
which
we
would
ordinarily
make
of
them
for
ourselves
and
the
sentiments
to
which
we
would
be
inclined
if
we
listened
only
to
our
animal
nature
it
alters
them
even
going
so
far
as
to
put
the
contrary
sentiments
in
their
place
does
it
not
even
go
so
far
as
to
make
us
regard
our
own
individual
lives
as
something
of
little
value
while
for
the
animal
this
is
the
greatest
of
things
then
it
is
a
vain
enterprise
to
seek
to
infer
the
mental
constitution
of
the
primitive
man
from
that
of
the
higher
animals
but
if
the
objection
of
spencer
does
not
have
the
decisive
value
which
its
author
gives
it
it
is
equally
true
that
the
animist
theory
can
draw
no
authority
from
the
confusions
which
children
seem
to
make
when
we
hear
a
child
angrily
apostrophize
an
object
which
he
has
hit
against
we
conclude
that
he
thinks
of
it
as
a
conscious
being
like
himself
but
that
is
interpreting
his
words
and
acts
very
badly
in
reality
he
is
quite
a
stranger
to
the
very
complicated
reasoning
attributed
to
him
if
he
lays
the
blame
on
the
table
which
has
hurt
him
it
is
not
because
he
supposes
it
animated
and
intelligent
but
because
it
has
hurt
him
his
anger
once
aroused
by
the
pain
must
overflow
so
it
looks
for
something
upon
which
to
discharge
itself
and
naturally
turns
toward
the
thing
which
has
provoked
it
even
though
this
has
no
effect
the
action
of
an
adult
in
similar
circumstances
is
often
as
slightly
reasonable
when
we
are
violently
irritated
we
feel
the
need
of
inveighing
of
destroying
though
we
attribute
no
conscious
to
the
objects
upon
which
we
vent
our
anger
there
is
even
so
little
confusion
that
when
the
emotion
of
a
child
is
calmed
he
can
very
well
distinguish
a
chair
from
a
person
he
does
not
act
in
at
all
the
same
way
towards
the
two
it
is
a
similar
reason
which
explains
his
tendency
to
treat
his
playthings
as
if
they
were
living
beings
it
is
his
extremely
intense
need
of
playing
which
thus
finds
a
means
of
expressing
itself
just
as
in
the
other
case
the
violent
sentiments
caused
by
pain
created
an
object
out
of
nothing
in
order
that
he
may
consciously
play
with
his
he
imagines
it
a
living
person
this
illusion
is
the
easier
for
him
because
imagination
is
his
sovereign
mistress
he
thinks
almost
entirely
with
images
and
we
know
how
pliant
images
are
bending
themselves
with
docility
before
every
exigency
of
the
will
but
he
is
so
little
deceived
by
his
own
fiction
that
he
would
be
the
first
to
be
surprised
if
it
suddenly
became
a
reality
and
his
toy
bit
him
let
us
therefore
leave
these
doubtful
analogies
to
one
side
to
find
out
if
men
were
primitively
inclined
to
the
confusions
imputed
to
them
we
should
not
study
animals
or
children
of
but
the
primitive
beliefs
themselves
if
the
spirits
and
gods
of
nature
were
really
formed
in
the
image
of
the
human
soul
they
should
bear
traces
of
their
origin
and
bring
to
mind
the
essential
traits
of
their
model
the
most
important
characteristic
of
the
soul
is
that
it
is
conceived
as
the
internal
principle
which
animates
the
organism
it
is
that
which
moves
it
and
makes
it
live
to
such
an
extent
that
when
it
withdraws
itself
life
ceases
or
is
suspended
it
has
its
natural
residence
in
the
body
at
least
while
this
exists
but
it
is
not
thus
with
the
spirits
assigned
to
the
different
things
in
nature
the
god
of
the
sun
is
not
necessarily
in
the
sun
nor
is
the
spirit
of
a
certain
rock
in
the
rock
which
is
its
principal
place
of
habitation
a
spirit
undoubtedly
has
close
relations
with
the
body
to
which
it
is
attached
but
one
employs
a
very
inexact
expression
when
he
says
that
it
is
its
soul
as
codrington
says
there
does
not
appear
to
be
anywhere
in
melanesia
a
belief
in
a
spirit
which
animates
any
natural
object
a
tree
waterfall
storm
or
rock
so
as
to
be
to
it
what
the
soul
is
believed
to
be
to
the
body
of
man
europeans
it
is
true
speak
of
the
spirits
of
the
sea
or
of
the
storm
or
of
the
forest
but
the
native
idea
which
they
represent
is
that
ghosts
haunt
the
sea
and
the
forest
having
power
to
raise
storms
and
strike
a
traveller
with
disease
while
the
soul
is
essentially
within
the
body
the
spirit
passes
the
major
portion
of
its
time
outside
the
object
which
serves
as
its
base
this
is
one
difference
which
does
not
seem
to
show
that
the
second
idea
was
derived
from
the
first
from
another
point
of
view
it
must
be
added
that
if
men
were
really
forced
to
project
their
own
image
into
things
then
the
first
sacred
beings
ought
to
have
been
conceived
in
their
likeness
now
anthropomorphism
far
from
being
primitive
is
rather
the
mark
of
a
relatively
advanced
civilization
in
the
beginning
sacred
beings
are
conceived
in
the
form
of
an
animal
or
vegetable
from
which
the
human
form
is
only
slowly
disengaged
it
will
be
seen
below
that
in
australia
it
is
animals
and
plants
which
are
the
first
sacred
beings
even
among
the
indians
of
north
america
the
great
cosmic
divinities
which
commence
to
be
the
object
of
a
cult
there
are
very
frequently
represented
in
animal
forms
the
difference
between
the
animal
man
and
the
divine
being
says
réville
not
without
surprise
is
not
felt
in
this
state
of
mind
and
generally
it
might
be
said
that
is
the
animal
form
which
is
the
fundamental
to
find
a
god
made
up
entirely
of
human
elements
it
is
necessary
to
advance
nearly
to
christianity
here
god
is
a
man
not
only
in
the
physical
aspect
in
which
he
is
temporarily
made
manifest
but
also
in
the
ideas
and
sentiments
which
he
expresses
but
even
in
greece
and
rome
though
the
gods
were
generally
represented
with
human
traits
many
mythical
personages
still
had
traces
of
an
animal
origin
thus
there
is
dionysus
who
is
often
met
with
in
the
form
of
a
bull
or
at
least
with
the
horns
of
a
bull
there
is
demeter
who
is
often
represented
with
a
mane
there
are
pan
and
silenus
there
are
the
fauns
etc
it
is
not
at
all
true
that
man
has
had
such
an
inclination
to
impose
his
own
form
upon
things
more
than
that
he
even
commenced
by
conceiving
of
himself
as
participating
closely
in
the
animal
nature
in
fact
it
is
a
belief
almost
universal
in
australia
and
very
widespread
among
the
indians
of
north
america
that
the
ancestors
of
men
were
beasts
or
plants
or
at
least
that
the
first
men
had
either
in
whole
or
in
part
the
distinctive
characters
of
certain
animal
or
vegetable
species
thus
far
from
seeing
beings
like
themselves
everywhere
men
commenced
by
believing
themselves
to
be
in
the
image
of
some
beings
from
which
they
differed
radically
v
finally
the
animistic
theory
implies
a
consequence
which
is
perhaps
its
best
refutation
if
it
were
true
it
would
be
necessary
to
admit
that
religious
beliefs
are
so
many
hallucinatory
representations
without
any
objective
foundation
whatsoever
it
is
supposed
that
they
are
all
derived
from
the
idea
of
the
soul
because
one
sees
only
a
magnified
soul
in
the
spirits
and
gods
but
according
to
tylor
and
his
disciples
the
idea
of
the
soul
is
itself
constructed
entirely
out
of
the
vague
and
inconsistent
images
which
occupy
our
attention
during
sleep
for
the
soul
is
the
double
and
the
double
is
merely
a
man
as
he
appears
to
himself
while
he
sleeps
from
this
point
of
view
then
sacred
beings
are
only
the
imaginary
conceptions
which
men
have
produced
during
a
sort
of
delirium
which
regularly
overtakes
them
every
day
though
it
is
quite
impossible
to
see
to
what
useful
ends
these
conceptions
serve
nor
what
they
answer
to
in
reality
if
a
man
prays
if
he
makes
sacrifices
and
offerings
if
he
submits
to
the
multiple
privations
which
the
ritual
prescribes
it
is
because
a
sort
of
constitutional
eccentricity
has
made
him
take
his
dreams
for
perceptions
death
for
a
prolonged
sleep
and
dead
bodies
for
living
and
thinking
beings
thus
not
only
is
it
true
as
many
have
held
that
the
forms
under
which
religious
powers
have
been
represented
to
the
mind
do
not
express
them
exactly
and
that
the
symbols
with
the
aid
of
which
they
have
been
thought
of
partially
hide
their
real
nature
but
more
than
that
behind
these
images
and
figures
there
exists
nothing
but
the
nightmares
of
primitive
minds
in
fine
religion
is
nothing
but
a
dream
systematized
and
lived
but
without
any
foundation
in
reality
thence
it
comes
about
that
the
theorists
of
animism
when
looking
for
the
origins
of
religious
thought
content
themselves
with
a
small
outlay
of
energy
when
they
think
that
they
have
explained
how
men
have
been
induced
to
imagine
beings
of
a
strange
vaporous
form
such
as
those
they
see
in
their
dreams
they
think
the
problem
is
resolved
in
reality
it
is
not
even
approached
it
is
inadmissible
that
systems
of
ideas
like
religions
which
have
held
so
considerable
a
place
in
history
and
to
which
in
all
times
men
have
come
to
receive
the
energy
which
they
must
have
to
live
should
be
made
up
of
a
tissue
of
illusions
we
are
beginning
to
realize
that
law
morals
and
even
scientific
thought
itself
were
born
of
religion
were
for
a
long
time
confounded
with
it
and
have
remained
penetrated
with
its
spirit
how
could
a
vain
fantasy
have
been
able
to
fashion
the
human
consciousness
so
strongly
and
so
durably
surely
it
ought
to
be
a
principle
of
the
science
of
religions
that
religion
expresses
nothing
which
does
not
exist
in
nature
for
there
are
sciences
only
of
natural
phenomena
the
only
question
is
to
learn
from
what
part
of
nature
these
realities
come
and
what
has
been
able
to
make
men
represent
them
under
this
singular
form
which
is
peculiar
to
religious
thought
but
if
this
question
is
to
be
raised
it
is
necessary
to
commence
by
admitting
that
they
are
real
things
which
are
thus
represented
when
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
made
religion
a
vast
error
imagined
by
the
priests
they
could
at
least
explain
its
persistence
by
the
interest
which
the
sacerdotal
class
had
in
deceiving
the
people
but
if
the
people
themselves
have
been
the
artisans
of
these
systems
of
erroneous
ideas
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
its
dupes
how
has
this
extraordinary
dupery
been
able
to
perpetuate
itself
all
through
the
course
of
history
one
might
even
demand
if
under
these
conditions
the
words
of
science
of
religions
can
be
employed
without
impropriety
a
science
is
a
discipline
which
in
whatever
manner
it
is
conceived
is
always
applied
to
some
real
data
physics
and
chemistry
are
sciences
because
phenomena
are
real
and
of
a
reality
which
does
not
depend
upon
the
truths
which
these
sciences
show
there
is
a
psychological
science
because
there
are
really
consciousnesses
which
do
not
hold
their
right
of
existence
from
the
psychologist
but
on
the
contrary
religion
could
not
survive
the
animistic
theory
and
the
day
when
its
truth
was
recognized
by
men
for
they
could
not
fail
to
renounce
the
errors
whose
nature
and
origin
would
thus
be
revealed
to
them
what
sort
of
a
science
is
it
whose
principal
discovery
is
that
the
subject
of
which
it
treats
does
not
exist
chapter
iii
leading
conceptions
of
the
elementary
religion
the
spirit
of
the
naturistic
school
is
quite
different
in
the
first
place
it
is
recruited
in
a
different
environment
the
animists
are
for
the
most
part
ethnologists
or
anthropologists
the
religions
which
they
have
studied
are
the
crudest
which
humanity
has
ever
known
hence
comes
the
extraordinary
importance
which
they
attribute
to
the
souls
of
the
dead
to
spirits
and
to
demons
and
in
fact
to
all
spiritual
beings
of
the
second
order
it
is
because
these
religions
know
hardly
any
of
a
higher
order
on
the
contrary
the
theories
which
we
are
now
going
to
describe
are
the
work
of
scholars
who
have
concerned
themselves
especially
with
the
great
civilizations
of
europe
and
asia
ever
since
the
work
of
the
grimm
brothers
who
pointed
out
the
interest
that
there
is
in
comparing
the
different
mythologies
of
the
peoples
scholars
have
been
struck
by
the
remarkable
similarities
which
these
present
mythical
personages
were
identified
who
though
having
different
names
symbolized
the
same
ideas
and
fulfilled
the
same
functions
even
the
names
were
frequently
related
and
it
has
been
thought
possible
to
establish
the
fact
that
they
are
not
unconnected
with
one
another
such
resemblances
seemed
to
be
explicable
only
by
a
common
origin
thus
they
were
led
to
suppose
that
these
conceptions
so
varied
in
appearance
really
came
from
one
common
source
of
which
they
were
only
diversified
forms
and
which
it
was
not
impossible
to
discover
by
the
comparative
method
they
believed
one
should
be
able
to
go
back
beyond
these
great
religions
to
a
much
more
ancient
system
of
ideas
and
to
the
really
primitive
religion
from
which
the
others
were
derived
the
discovery
of
the
vedas
aided
greatly
in
stimulating
these
ambitions
in
the
vedas
scholars
had
a
written
text
whose
antiquity
was
undoubtedly
exaggerated
at
the
moment
of
its
discovery
but
which
is
surely
one
of
the
most
ancient
which
we
have
at
our
disposition
in
an
language
here
they
were
enabled
to
study
by
the
ordinary
methods
of
philology
a
literature
as
old
as
or
older
than
homer
and
a
religion
which
was
believed
more
primitive
than
that
of
the
ancient
germans
a
document
of
such
value
was
evidently
destined
to
throw
a
new
light
upon
the
religious
beginnings
of
humanity
and
the
science
of
religions
could
not
fail
to
be
revolutionized
by
it
the
conception
which
was
thus
born
was
so
fully
demanded
by
the
state
of
the
science
and
by
the
general
march
of
ideas
that
it
appeared
almost
simultaneously
in
two
different
lands
in
max
müller
exposed
its
principles
in
his
three
years
later
appeared
the
work
of
adalbert
kuhn
on
origin
of
fire
and
the
drink
of
the
which
was
clearly
inspired
by
the
same
spirit
when
once
set
forth
the
idea
spread
very
rapidly
in
scientific
circles
to
the
name
of
kuhn
is
closely
associated
that
of
his
schwartz
whose
work
on
origin
of
followed
closely
upon
the
preceding
one
steinthal
and
the
whole
german
school
of
attached
themselves
to
the
same
movement
the
theory
was
introduced
into
france
in
by
michel
bréal
it
met
so
little
resistance
that
according
to
an
expression
of
gruppe
a
time
came
when
aside
from
certain
classical
philologists
to
whom
vedic
studies
were
unknown
all
the
mythologists
had
adopted
the
principles
of
max
müller
or
kuhn
as
their
point
of
departure
it
is
therefore
important
to
see
what
they
really
are
and
what
they
are
worth
since
no
one
has
presented
them
in
a
more
systematic
form
than
max
müller
it
is
upon
his
work
that
we
shall
base
the
description
which
follows
i
we
have
seen
that
the
postulate
at
the
basis
of
animism
is
that
religion
at
least
in
its
origin
expresses
no
physical
reality
but
max
müller
commences
with
the
contrary
principle
for
him
it
is
an
axiom
that
religion
reposes
upon
an
experience
from
which
it
draws
all
its
authority
religion
he
says
if
it
is
to
hold
its
place
as
a
legitimate
element
of
our
consciousness
must
like
all
other
knowledge
begin
with
sensuous
experience
taking
up
the
old
empirical
adage
est
in
intellectu
quod
non
ante
fuerit
in
he
applies
it
to
religion
and
declares
that
there
can
be
nothing
in
beliefs
which
was
not
first
perceived
so
here
is
a
doctrine
which
seems
to
escape
the
grave
objection
which
we
raised
against
animism
from
this
point
of
view
it
seems
that
religion
ought
to
appear
not
as
a
sort
of
vague
and
confused
dreaming
but
as
a
system
of
ideas
and
practices
well
founded
in
reality
but
which
are
these
sensations
which
give
birth
to
religious
thought
that
is
the
question
which
the
study
of
the
vedas
is
supposed
to
aid
in
resolving
the
names
of
the
gods
are
generally
either
common
words
still
employed
or
else
words
formerly
common
whose
original
sense
it
is
possible
to
discover
now
both
designate
the
principal
phenomena
of
nature
thus
the
name
of
one
of
the
principal
divinities
of
india
originally
signified
only
the
material
fact
of
fire
such
as
it
is
ordinarily
perceived
by
the
senses
and
without
any
mythological
addition
even
in
the
vedas
it
is
still
employed
with
this
meaning
in
any
case
it
is
well
shown
that
this
signification
was
primitive
by
the
fact
that
it
is
conserved
in
other
languages
the
latin
the
lithuanian
the
old
slav
are
evidently
closely
related
to
agni
similarly
the
relationship
of
the
sanskrit
the
greek
the
latin
and
the
of
high
german
is
uncontested
this
proves
that
these
different
words
designate
one
single
and
the
same
divinity
whom
the
different
peoples
recognized
as
such
before
their
separation
now
dyaus
signifies
the
bright
sky
these
and
other
similar
facts
tend
to
show
that
among
these
peoples
the
forms
and
forces
of
nature
were
the
first
objects
to
which
the
religious
sentiment
attached
itself
they
were
the
first
things
to
be
deified
going
one
step
farther
in
his
generalization
max
müller
thought
that
he
was
prepared
to
conclude
that
the
religious
evolution
of
humanity
in
general
had
the
same
point
of
departure
it
is
almost
entirely
by
considerations
of
a
psychological
sort
that
he
justifies
these
inferences
the
varied
spectacles
which
nature
offers
man
seemed
to
him
to
fulfil
all
the
conditions
necessary
for
arousing
religious
ideas
in
the
mind
directly
in
fact
he
says
at
first
sight
nothing
seemed
less
natural
than
nature
nature
was
the
greatest
surprise
a
terror
a
marvel
a
standing
miracle
and
it
was
only
on
account
of
their
permanence
constancy
and
regular
recurrence
that
certain
features
of
that
standing
miracle
were
called
natural
in
the
sense
of
foreseen
common
intelligible
it
was
that
vast
domain
of
surprise
of
terror
of
marvel
of
miracle
the
unknown
as
distinguished
from
the
known
or
as
i
like
to
express
it
the
infinite
as
distinct
from
the
finite
which
supplied
from
the
earliest
times
the
impulse
to
religious
thought
and
language
in
order
to
illustrate
his
idea
he
applies
it
to
a
natural
force
which
holds
a
rather
large
place
in
the
vedic
religion
fire
he
says
if
you
can
for
a
moment
transfer
yourselves
to
that
early
stage
of
life
to
which
we
must
refer
not
only
the
origin
but
likewise
the
early
phases
of
physical
religion
you
can
easily
understand
what
an
impression
the
first
appearance
of
fire
must
have
made
on
the
human
mind
fire
was
not
given
as
something
permanent
or
eternal
like
the
sky
or
the
earth
or
the
water
in
whatever
way
it
first
appeared
whether
through
lightning
or
through
the
friction
of
the
branches
of
trees
or
through
the
sparks
of
flints
it
came
and
went
it
had
to
be
guarded
it
brought
destruction
but
at
the
same
time
it
made
life
possible
in
winter
it
served
as
a
protection
during
the
night
it
became
a
weapon
of
defence
and
offence
and
last
not
least
it
changed
man
from
a
devourer
of
raw
flesh
into
an
eater
of
cooked
meat
at
a
later
time
it
became
the
means
of
working
metal
of
making
tools
and
weapons
it
became
an
indispensable
factor
in
all
mechanical
and
artistic
progress
and
has
remained
so
ever
since
what
should
we
be
without
fire
even
now
the
same
author
says
in
another
work
that
a
man
could
not
enter
into
relations
with
nature
without
taking
account
of
its
immensity
of
its
infiniteness
it
surpasses
him
in
every
way
beyond
the
distances
which
he
perceives
there
are
others
which
extend
without
limits
each
moment
of
time
is
preceded
and
followed
by
a
time
to
which
no
limit
can
be
assigned
the
flowing
river
manifests
an
infinite
force
since
nothing
can
exhaust
it
there
is
no
aspect
of
nature
which
is
not
fitted
to
awaken
within
us
this
overwhelming
sensation
of
an
infinity
which
surrounds
us
and
dominates
us
it
is
from
this
sensation
that
religions
are
derived
however
they
are
there
only
in
germ
religion
really
commences
only
at
the
moment
when
these
natural
forces
are
no
longer
represented
in
the
mind
in
an
abstract
form
they
must
be
transformed
into
personal
agents
living
and
thinking
beings
spiritual
powers
or
gods
for
it
is
to
beings
of
this
sort
that
the
cult
is
generally
addressed
we
have
seen
that
animism
itself
has
been
obliged
to
raise
this
question
and
also
how
it
has
answered
it
man
seems
to
have
a
sort
of
native
incapacity
for
distinguishing
the
animate
from
the
inanimate
and
an
irresistible
tendency
to
conceive
the
second
under
the
form
of
the
first
max
müller
rejects
any
such
solution
according
to
him
it
is
language
which
has
brought
about
this
metamorphosis
by
the
action
which
it
exercises
upon
thought
it
is
easily
explained
how
men
being
perplexed
by
the
marvellous
forces
upon
which
they
feel
that
they
depend
have
been
led
to
reflect
upon
them
and
how
they
have
asked
themselves
what
these
forces
are
and
have
made
an
effort
to
substitute
for
the
obscure
sensation
which
they
primitively
had
of
them
a
clearer
idea
and
a
better
defined
concept
but
as
our
author
very
justly
says
this
idea
and
concept
are
impossible
without
the
word
language
is
not
merely
the
external
covering
of
a
thought
it
also
is
its
internal
framework
it
does
not
confine
itself
to
expressing
this
thought
after
it
has
once
been
formed
it
also
aids
in
making
it
however
its
nature
is
of
a
different
sort
so
its
laws
are
not
those
of
thought
then
since
it
contributes
to
the
elaboration
of
this
latter
it
can
not
fail
to
do
it
violence
to
some
extent
and
to
deform
it
it
is
a
deformation
of
this
sort
which
is
said
to
have
created
the
special
characteristic
of
religious
thought
thinking
consists
in
arranging
our
ideas
and
consequently
in
classifying
them
to
think
of
fire
for
example
is
to
put
it
into
a
certain
category
of
things
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
able
to
say
that
it
is
this
or
that
or
this
and
not
that
but
classifying
is
also
naming
for
a
general
idea
has
no
existence
and
reality
except
in
and
by
the
word
which
expresses
it
and
which
alone
makes
its
individuality
thus
the
language
of
a
people
always
has
an
influence
upon
the
manner
in
which
new
things
recently
learned
are
classified
in
the
mind
and
are
subsequently
thought
of
these
new
things
are
thus
forced
to
adapt
themselves
to
forms
for
this
reason
the
language
which
men
spoke
when
they
undertook
to
construct
an
elaborated
representation
of
the
universe
marked
the
system
of
ideas
which
was
then
born
with
an
indelible
trace
nor
are
we
without
some
knowledge
of
this
language
at
least
in
so
far
as
the
peoples
are
concerned
howsoever
distant
it
may
be
from
us
souvenirs
of
it
remain
in
our
actual
languages
which
permit
us
to
imagine
what
it
was
these
are
the
roots
these
stems
from
which
are
derived
all
the
words
which
we
employ
and
which
are
found
at
the
basis
of
all
the
languages
are
regarded
by
max
müller
as
so
many
echoes
of
the
language
which
the
corresponding
peoples
spoke
before
their
separation
that
is
to
say
at
the
very
moment
when
this
religion
of
nature
which
is
to
be
explained
was
being
formed
now
these
roots
present
two
remarkable
characteristics
which
it
is
true
have
as
yet
been
observed
only
in
this
particular
group
of
languages
but
which
our
author
believes
to
be
present
equally
in
the
other
linguistic
families
in
the
first
place
the
roots
are
general
that
is
to
say
that
they
do
not
express
particular
things
and
individuals
but
types
and
even
types
of
an
extreme
generality
they
represent
the
most
general
themes
of
thought
one
finds
there
as
though
fixed
and
crystallized
those
fundamental
categories
of
the
intellect
which
at
every
moment
in
history
dominate
the
entire
mental
life
the
arrangement
of
which
philosophers
have
many
times
attempted
to
reconstruct
secondly
the
types
to
which
they
correspond
are
types
of
action
and
not
of
objects
they
translate
the
most
general
manners
of
acting
which
are
to
be
observed
among
living
beings
and
especially
among
men
they
are
such
actions
as
striking
pushing
rubbing
lying
down
getting
up
pressing
mounting
descending
walking
etc
in
other
words
men
generalized
and
named
their
principal
ways
of
acting
before
generalizing
and
naming
the
phenomena
of
nature
owing
to
their
extreme
generality
these
words
could
easily
be
extended
to
all
sorts
of
objects
which
they
did
not
originally
include
it
is
even
this
extreme
suppleness
which
has
permitted
them
to
give
birth
to
the
numerous
words
which
are
derived
from
them
then
when
men
turning
towards
things
undertook
to
name
them
that
they
might
be
able
to
think
about
them
they
applied
these
words
to
them
though
they
were
in
no
way
designed
for
them
but
owing
to
their
origin
these
were
able
to
designate
the
forces
of
nature
only
by
means
of
their
manifestations
which
seemed
the
nearest
to
human
actions
a
thunderbolt
was
called
that
tears
up
the
soil
or
that
spreads
fire
the
wind
that
sighs
or
whistles
the
sun
that
throws
golden
arrows
across
space
a
river
that
flows
etc
but
since
natural
phenomena
were
thus
compared
to
human
acts
this
to
which
they
were
attached
was
necessarily
conceived
under
the
form
of
personal
agents
more
or
less
like
men
it
was
only
a
metaphor
but
it
was
taken
literally
the
error
was
inevitable
for
science
which
alone
could
dispel
the
illusion
did
not
yet
exist
in
a
word
since
language
was
made
of
human
elements
translating
human
states
it
could
not
be
applied
to
nature
without
transforming
it
even
remarks
bréal
it
forces
us
in
a
certain
measure
to
represent
things
from
this
angle
we
do
not
express
an
idea
even
one
designating
a
simple
quality
without
giving
it
a
gender
that
is
to
say
a
sex
we
can
not
speak
of
an
object
even
though
it
be
considered
in
a
most
general
fashion
without
determining
it
by
an
article
every
subject
of
a
sentence
is
presented
as
an
active
being
every
idea
as
an
action
and
every
action
be
it
transitory
or
permanent
is
limited
in
its
duration
by
the
tense
in
which
we
put
the
verb
our
scientific
training
enables
us
to
rectify
the
errors
which
language
might
thus
suggest
to
us
but
the
influence
of
the
word
ought
to
be
when
it
has
no
check
language
thus
superimposes
upon
the
material
world
such
as
it
is
revealed
to
our
senses
a
new
world
composed
wholly
of
spiritual
beings
which
it
has
created
out
of
nothing
and
which
have
been
considered
as
the
causes
determining
physical
phenomena
ever
since
but
its
action
does
not
stop
there
when
words
were
once
forged
to
represent
these
personalities
which
the
popular
imagination
had
placed
behind
things
a
reaction
affected
these
words
themselves
they
raised
all
sorts
of
questions
and
it
was
to
resolve
these
problems
that
myths
were
invented
it
happened
that
one
object
received
a
plurality
of
names
corresponding
to
the
plurality
of
aspects
under
which
it
was
presented
in
experience
thus
there
are
more
than
twenty
words
in
the
vedas
for
the
sky
since
these
words
were
different
it
was
believed
that
they
corresponded
to
so
many
distinct
personalities
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
strongly
felt
that
these
same
personalities
had
an
air
of
relationship
to
account
for
that
it
was
imagined
that
they
formed
a
single
family
genealogies
a
civil
condition
and
a
history
were
invented
for
them
in
other
cases
different
things
were
designated
by
the
same
term
to
explain
these
homonyms
it
was
believed
that
the
corresponding
things
were
transformations
of
each
other
and
new
fictions
were
invented
to
make
these
metamorphoses
intelligible
or
again
a
word
which
had
ceased
to
be
understood
was
the
origin
of
fables
designed
to
give
it
a
meaning
the
creative
work
of
language
continued
then
making
constructions
ever
more
and
more
complex
and
then
mythology
came
to
endow
each
god
with
a
biography
ever
more
and
more
extended
and
complete
the
result
of
all
of
which
was
that
the
divine
personalities
at
first
confounded
with
things
finally
distinguished
and
determined
themselves
this
is
how
the
notion
of
the
divine
is
said
to
have
been
constructed
as
for
the
religion
of
ancestors
it
was
only
a
reflection
of
this
other
the
idea
of
the
soul
is
said
to
have
been
first
formed
for
reasons
somewhat
analogous
to
those
given
by
tylor
except
that
according
to
max
müller
they
were
designed
to
account
for
death
rather
than
for
dreams
then
under
the
influence
of
diverse
partially
accidental
circumstances
the
souls
of
men
being
once
disengaged
from
the
body
were
drawn
little
by
little
within
the
circle
of
divine
beings
and
were
thus
finally
deified
themselves
but
this
new
cult
was
the
product
of
only
a
secondary
formation
this
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
deified
men
have
generally
been
imperfect
gods
or
whom
the
people
have
always
been
able
to
distinguish
from
the
genuine
deities
ii
this
doctrine
rests
in
part
upon
a
certain
number
of
linguistic
postulates
which
have
been
and
still
are
very
much
questioned
some
have
contested
the
reality
of
many
of
the
similarities
which
max
müller
claimed
to
have
found
between
the
names
of
the
gods
in
the
various
european
languages
the
interpretation
which
he
gave
them
has
been
especially
doubted
it
has
been
asked
if
these
names
far
from
being
the
mark
of
a
very
primitive
religion
are
not
the
slow
product
either
of
direct
borrowings
or
of
natural
intercourse
with
others
also
it
is
no
longer
admitted
that
the
roots
once
existed
in
an
isolated
state
as
autonomous
realities
nor
that
they
allow
us
to
reconstruct
even
hypothetically
the
original
language
of
the
finally
recent
researches
would
tend
to
show
that
the
vedic
divinities
did
not
all
have
the
exclusively
naturistic
character
attributed
to
them
by
max
müller
and
his
school
but
we
shall
leave
aside
those
questions
the
discussion
of
which
requires
a
special
competence
as
a
philologist
and
address
ourselves
directly
to
the
general
principles
of
the
system
it
will
be
important
here
not
to
confound
the
naturistic
theory
with
these
controverted
postulates
for
this
is
held
by
numbers
of
scholars
who
do
not
make
language
play
the
predominating
rôle
attributed
to
it
by
max
müller
that
men
have
an
interest
in
knowing
the
world
which
surrounds
them
and
consequently
that
their
reflection
should
have
been
applied
to
it
at
an
early
date
is
something
that
everyone
will
readily
admit
with
the
things
with
which
they
were
in
immediate
connection
was
so
necessary
for
them
that
they
could
not
fail
to
seek
a
knowledge
of
their
nature
but
if
as
naturism
pretends
it
is
of
these
reflections
that
religious
thought
was
born
it
is
impossible
to
explain
how
it
was
able
to
survive
the
first
attempts
made
and
the
persistence
with
which
it
has
maintained
itself
becomes
unintelligible
if
we
have
need
of
knowing
the
nature
of
things
it
is
in
order
to
act
upon
them
in
an
appropriate
manner
but
the
conception
of
the
universe
given
us
by
religion
especially
in
its
early
forms
is
too
greatly
mutilated
to
lead
to
temporarily
useful
practices
things
become
nothing
less
than
living
and
thinking
beings
minds
or
personalities
like
those
which
the
religious
imagination
has
made
into
the
agents
of
cosmic
phenomena
it
is
not
by
conceiving
of
them
under
this
form
or
by
treating
them
according
to
this
conception
that
men
could
make
them
work
for
their
ends
it
is
not
by
addressing
prayers
to
them
by
celebrating
them
in
feasts
and
sacrifices
or
by
imposing
upon
themselves
fasts
and
privations
that
men
can
deter
them
from
working
harm
or
oblige
them
to
serve
their
own
designs
such
processes
could
succeed
only
very
exceptionally
and
so
to
speak
miraculously
if
then
religion
reason
for
existence
was
to
give
us
a
conception
of
the
world
which
would
guide
us
in
our
relations
with
it
it
was
in
no
condition
to
fulfil
its
function
and
people
would
not
have
been
slow
to
perceive
it
failures
being
infinitely
more
frequent
than
successes
would
have
quickly
shown
them
that
they
were
following
a
false
route
and
religion
shaken
at
each
instant
by
these
repeated
contradictions
would
not
have
been
able
to
survive
it
is
undeniably
true
that
errors
have
been
able
to
perpetuate
themselves
in
history
but
except
under
a
union
of
very
exceptional
circumstances
they
can
never
perpetuate
themselves
thus
unless
they
were
that
is
to
say
unless
without
giving
us
a
theoretically
exact
idea
of
the
things
with
which
they
deal
they
express
well
enough
the
manner
in
which
they
affect
us
either
for
good
or
for
bad
under
these
circumstances
the
actions
which
they
determine
have
every
chance
of
being
at
least
in
a
general
way
the
very
ones
which
are
proper
so
it
is
easily
explained
how
they
have
been
able
to
survive
the
proofs
of
experience
but
an
error
and
especially
a
system
of
errors
which
leads
to
and
can
lead
to
nothing
but
mistaken
and
useless
practices
has
no
chance
of
living
now
what
is
there
in
common
between
the
rites
with
which
the
believer
tries
to
act
upon
nature
and
the
processes
by
which
science
has
taught
us
to
make
use
of
it
and
which
we
now
know
are
the
only
efficacious
ones
if
that
is
what
men
demanded
of
religion
it
is
impossible
to
see
how
it
could
have
maintained
itself
unless
clever
tricks
had
prevented
their
seeing
that
it
did
not
give
them
what
they
expected
from
it
it
would
be
necessary
to
return
again
to
the
over
simple
explanations
of
the
eighteenth
century
thus
it
is
only
in
appearance
that
naturism
escapes
the
objection
which
we
recently
raised
against
animism
it
also
makes
religion
a
system
of
hallucinations
since
it
reduces
it
to
an
immense
metaphor
with
no
objective
value
it
is
true
that
it
gives
religion
a
point
of
departure
in
reality
to
wit
in
the
sensations
which
the
phenomena
of
nature
provoke
in
us
but
by
the
bewitching
action
of
language
this
sensation
is
soon
transformed
into
extravagant
conceptions
religious
thought
does
not
come
in
contact
with
reality
except
to
cover
it
at
once
with
a
thick
veil
which
conceals
its
real
forms
this
veil
is
the
tissue
of
fabulous
beliefs
which
mythology
brought
forth
thus
the
believer
like
the
delirious
man
lives
in
a
world
peopled
with
beings
and
things
which
have
only
a
verbal
existence
max
müller
himself
recognized
this
for
he
regarded
myths
as
the
product
of
a
disease
of
the
intellect
at
first
he
attributed
them
to
a
disease
of
language
but
since
language
and
the
intellect
are
inseparable
for
him
what
is
true
of
the
one
is
true
of
the
other
when
trying
to
explain
the
inmost
nature
of
mythology
he
says
i
called
it
a
disease
of
language
rather
than
of
thought
after
i
had
fully
explained
in
my
of
that
language
and
thought
are
inseparable
and
that
a
disease
of
language
is
therefore
the
same
thing
as
a
disease
of
thought
no
doubt
ought
to
have
remained
as
to
what
i
meant
to
represent
the
supreme
god
as
committing
every
kind
of
crime
as
being
deceived
by
men
as
being
angry
with
his
wife
and
violent
with
his
children
is
surely
a
proof
of
a
disease
of
an
unusual
condition
of
thought
or
to
speak
more
clearly
of
real
madness
and
this
argument
is
not
valid
merely
against
max
müller
and
his
theory
but
against
the
very
principle
of
naturism
in
whatever
way
it
may
be
applied
whatever
we
may
do
if
religion
has
as
its
principal
object
the
expression
of
the
forces
of
nature
it
is
impossible
to
see
in
it
anything
more
than
a
system
of
lying
fictions
whose
survival
is
incomprehensible
max
müller
thought
he
escaped
this
objection
whose
gravity
he
felt
by
distinguishing
radically
between
mythology
and
religion
and
by
putting
the
first
outside
the
second
he
claims
the
right
of
reserving
the
name
of
religion
for
only
those
beliefs
which
conform
to
the
prescriptions
of
a
sane
moral
system
and
a
rational
theology
the
myths
were
parasitic
growths
which
under
the
influence
of
language
attached
themselves
upon
these
fundamental
conceptions
and
denatured
them
thus
the
belief
in
zeus
was
religious
in
so
far
as
the
greeks
considered
him
the
supreme
god
father
of
humanity
protector
of
laws
avenger
of
crimes
etc
but
all
that
which
concerned
the
biography
of
zeus
his
marriages
and
his
adventures
was
only
mythology
but
this
distinction
is
arbitrary
it
is
true
that
mythology
has
an
æsthetic
interest
as
well
as
one
for
the
history
of
religions
but
it
is
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
the
religious
life
nevertheless
if
the
myth
were
withdrawn
from
religion
it
would
be
necessary
to
withdraw
the
rite
also
for
the
rites
are
generally
addressed
to
definite
personalities
who
have
a
name
a
character
determined
attributes
and
a
history
and
they
vary
according
to
the
manner
in
which
these
personalities
are
conceived
the
cult
rendered
to
a
divinity
depends
upon
the
character
attributed
to
him
and
it
is
the
myth
which
determines
this
character
very
frequently
the
rite
is
nothing
more
than
the
myth
put
in
action
the
christian
communion
is
inseparable
from
the
myth
of
the
last
supper
from
which
it
derives
all
its
meaning
then
if
all
mythology
is
the
result
of
a
sort
of
verbal
delirium
the
question
which
we
raised
remains
intact
the
existence
and
especially
the
persistence
of
the
cult
become
inexplicable
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
men
have
continued
to
do
certain
things
for
centuries
without
any
object
moreover
it
is
not
merely
the
peculiar
traits
of
the
divine
personalities
which
are
determined
by
mythology
the
very
idea
that
there
are
gods
or
spiritual
beings
set
above
the
various
departments
of
nature
in
no
matter
what
manner
they
may
be
represented
is
essentially
mythical
now
if
all
that
which
appertains
to
the
notion
of
gods
conceived
as
cosmic
agents
is
blotted
out
of
the
religions
of
the
past
what
remains
the
idea
of
a
divinity
in
itself
of
a
transcendental
power
upon
which
man
depends
and
upon
which
he
supports
himself
but
that
is
only
an
abstract
and
philosophic
conception
which
has
been
fully
realized
in
no
historical
religion
it
is
without
interest
for
the
science
of
religions
we
must
therefore
avoid
distinguishing
between
religious
beliefs
keeping
some
because
they
seem
to
us
to
be
true
and
sane
and
rejecting
others
because
they
shock
and
disconcert
us
all
myths
even
those
which
we
find
the
most
unreasonable
have
been
believed
men
have
believed
in
them
no
less
firmly
than
in
their
own
sensations
they
have
based
their
conduct
upon
them
in
spite
of
appearances
it
is
therefore
impossible
that
they
should
be
without
objective
foundation
however
it
will
be
said
that
in
whatever
manner
religions
may
be
explained
it
is
certain
that
they
are
mistaken
in
regard
to
the
real
nature
of
things
science
has
proved
it
the
modes
of
action
which
they
counsel
or
prescribe
to
men
can
therefore
rarely
have
useful
effects
it
is
not
by
lustrations
that
the
sick
are
cured
nor
by
sacrifices
and
chants
that
the
crops
are
made
to
grow
thus
the
objection
which
we
have
made
to
naturism
would
seem
to
be
applicable
to
all
possible
systems
of
explanation
nevertheless
there
is
one
which
escapes
it
let
us
suppose
that
religion
responds
to
quite
another
need
than
that
of
adapting
ourselves
to
sensible
objects
then
it
will
not
risk
being
weakened
by
the
fact
that
it
does
not
satisfy
or
only
badly
satisfies
this
need
if
religious
faith
was
not
born
to
put
man
in
harmony
with
the
material
world
the
injuries
which
it
has
been
able
to
do
him
in
his
struggle
with
the
world
do
not
touch
it
at
its
source
because
it
is
fed
from
another
if
it
is
not
for
these
reasons
that
a
man
comes
to
believe
he
should
continue
to
believe
even
when
these
reasons
are
contradicted
by
the
facts
it
is
even
conceivable
that
faith
should
be
strong
enough
not
only
to
support
these
contradictions
but
also
even
to
deny
them
and
to
keep
the
believer
from
seeing
their
importance
this
is
what
succeeds
in
rendering
them
inoffensive
for
religion
when
the
religious
sentiment
is
active
it
will
not
admit
that
religion
can
be
in
the
wrong
and
it
readily
suggests
explanations
which
make
it
appear
innocent
if
the
rite
does
not
produce
the
desired
results
this
failure
is
imputed
either
to
some
fault
of
execution
or
to
the
intervention
of
another
contrary
deity
but
for
that
it
is
necessary
that
these
religious
ideas
have
their
source
in
another
sentiment
than
that
betrayed
by
these
deceptions
of
experience
or
else
whence
could
come
their
force
of
resistance
iii
but
more
than
that
even
if
men
had
really
had
reasons
for
remaining
obstinate
in
spite
of
all
their
mistakes
in
expressing
cosmic
phenomena
in
religious
terms
it
is
also
necessary
that
these
be
of
a
nature
to
suggest
such
an
interpretation
now
when
could
they
have
gotten
such
a
property
here
again
we
find
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
one
of
those
postulates
which
pass
as
evident
only
because
they
have
not
been
criticized
it
is
stated
as
an
axiom
that
in
the
natural
play
of
physical
forces
there
is
all
that
is
needed
to
arouse
within
us
the
idea
of
the
sacred
but
when
we
closely
examine
the
proofs
of
this
proposition
which
by
the
way
are
sufficiently
brief
we
find
that
they
reduce
to
a
prejudice
they
talk
about
the
marvel
which
men
should
feel
as
they
discover
the
world
but
really
that
which
characterizes
the
life
of
nature
is
a
regularity
which
approaches
monotony
every
morning
the
sun
mounts
in
the
horizon
every
evening
it
sets
every
month
the
moon
goes
through
the
same
cycle
the
river
flows
in
an
uninterrupted
manner
in
its
bed
the
same
seasons
periodically
bring
back
the
same
sensations
to
be
sure
here
and
there
an
unexpected
event
sometimes
happens
the
sun
is
eclipsed
the
moon
is
hidden
behind
clouds
the
river
overflows
but
these
momentary
variations
could
only
give
birth
to
equally
momentary
impressions
the
remembrance
of
which
is
gone
after
a
little
while
they
could
not
serve
as
a
basis
for
these
stable
and
permanent
systems
of
ideas
and
practices
which
constitute
religions
normally
the
course
of
nature
is
uniform
and
uniformity
could
never
produce
strong
emotions
representing
the
savage
as
filled
with
admiration
before
these
marvels
transports
much
more
recent
sentiments
to
the
beginnings
of
history
he
is
much
too
accustomed
to
it
to
be
greatly
surprised
by
it
it
requires
culture
and
reflection
to
shake
off
this
yoke
of
habit
and
to
discover
how
marvellous
this
regularity
itself
is
besides
as
we
have
already
remarked
admiring
an
object
is
not
enough
to
make
it
appear
sacred
to
us
that
is
to
say
to
mark
it
with
those
characteristics
which
make
all
direct
contact
with
it
appear
a
sacrilege
and
a
profanation
we
misunderstand
what
the
religious
sentiment
really
is
if
we
confound
it
with
every
impression
of
admiration
and
surprise
but
they
say
even
if
it
is
not
admiration
there
is
a
certain
impression
which
men
can
not
help
feeling
in
the
presence
of
nature
he
can
not
come
in
contact
with
it
without
realizing
that
it
is
greater
than
he
it
overwhelms
him
by
its
immensity
this
sensation
of
an
infinite
space
which
surrounds
him
of
an
infinite
time
which
has
preceded
and
will
follow
the
present
moment
and
of
forces
infinitely
superior
to
those
of
which
he
is
master
can
not
fail
as
it
seems
to
awaken
within
him
the
idea
that
outside
of
him
there
exists
an
infinite
power
upon
which
he
depends
and
this
idea
enters
as
an
essential
element
into
our
conception
of
the
divine
but
let
us
bear
in
mind
what
the
question
is
we
are
trying
to
find
out
how
men
came
to
think
that
there
are
in
reality
two
categories
of
things
radically
heterogeneous
and
incomparable
to
each
other
now
how
could
the
spectacle
of
nature
give
rise
to
the
idea
of
this
duality
nature
is
always
and
everywhere
of
the
same
sort
it
matters
little
that
it
extends
to
infinity
beyond
the
extreme
limit
to
which
my
eyes
can
reach
it
is
not
different
from
what
it
is
here
the
space
which
i
imagine
beyond
the
horizon
is
still
space
identical
with
that
which
i
see
the
time
which
flows
without
end
is
made
up
of
moments
identical
with
those
which
i
have
passed
through
extension
like
duration
repeats
itself
indefinitely
if
the
portions
which
i
touch
have
of
themselves
no
sacred
character
where
did
the
others
get
theirs
the
fact
that
i
do
not
see
them
directly
is
not
enough
to
transform
them
a
world
of
profane
things
may
well
be
unlimited
but
it
remains
a
profane
world
do
they
say
that
the
physical
forces
with
which
we
come
in
contact
exceed
our
own
sacred
forces
are
not
to
be
distinguished
from
profane
ones
simply
by
their
greater
intensity
they
are
different
they
have
special
qualities
which
the
others
do
not
have
quite
on
the
contrary
all
the
forces
manifested
in
the
universe
are
of
the
same
nature
those
that
are
within
us
just
as
those
that
are
outside
of
us
and
especially
there
is
no
reason
which
could
have
allowed
giving
a
sort
of
dignity
to
some
in
relation
to
others
then
if
religion
really
was
born
because
of
the
need
of
assigning
causes
to
physical
phenomena
the
forces
thus
imagined
would
have
been
no
more
sacred
than
those
conceived
by
the
scientist
to
account
for
the
same
facts
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
there
would
have
been
no
sacred
beings
and
therefore
no
religion
but
even
supposing
that
this
sensation
of
being
overwhelmed
were
really
able
to
suggest
religious
ideas
it
could
not
have
produced
this
effect
upon
the
primitive
for
he
does
not
have
it
he
is
in
no
way
conscious
that
cosmic
forces
are
so
superior
to
his
own
since
science
has
not
yet
taught
him
modesty
he
attributes
to
himself
an
empire
over
things
which
he
really
does
not
have
but
the
illusion
of
which
is
enough
to
prevent
his
feeling
dominated
by
them
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
he
thinks
that
he
can
command
the
elements
release
the
winds
compel
the
rain
to
fall
or
stop
the
sun
by
a
gesture
etc
religion
itself
contributes
to
giving
him
this
security
for
he
believes
that
it
arms
him
with
extended
powers
over
nature
his
rites
are
in
part
means
destined
to
aid
him
in
imposing
his
will
upon
the
world
thus
far
from
being
due
to
the
sentiment
which
men
should
have
of
their
littleness
before
the
universe
religions
are
rather
inspired
by
the
contrary
sentiment
even
the
most
elevated
and
idealistic
have
the
effect
of
reassuring
men
in
their
struggle
with
things
they
teach
that
faith
is
of
itself
able
to
move
mountains
that
is
to
say
to
dominate
the
forces
of
nature
how
could
they
give
rise
to
this
confidence
if
they
had
had
their
origin
in
a
sensation
of
feebleness
and
impotency
finally
if
the
objects
of
nature
really
became
sacred
because
of
their
imposing
forms
or
the
forces
which
they
manifest
then
the
sun
the
moon
the
sky
the
mountains
the
sea
the
winds
in
a
word
the
great
cosmic
powers
should
have
been
the
first
to
be
raised
to
this
dignity
for
there
are
no
others
more
fitted
to
appeal
to
the
senses
and
the
imagination
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
divinized
but
slowly
the
first
beings
to
which
the
cult
is
addressed
the
proof
will
be
found
in
the
chapters
which
follow
are
humble
vegetables
and
animals
in
relation
to
which
men
could
at
least
claim
an
equality
they
are
ducks
rabbits
kangaroos
lizards
worms
frogs
etc
their
objective
qualities
surely
were
not
the
origin
of
the
religious
sentiments
which
they
inspired
chapter
iv
totemism
as
an
elementary
religion
of
the
method
of
treating
howsoever
opposed
their
conclusions
may
seem
to
be
the
two
systems
which
we
have
just
studied
agree
upon
one
essential
point
they
state
the
problem
in
identical
terms
both
undertake
to
construct
the
idea
of
the
divine
out
of
the
sensations
aroused
in
us
by
certain
natural
phenomena
either
physical
or
biological
for
the
animists
it
is
dreams
for
the
naturists
certain
cosmic
phenomena
which
served
as
the
point
of
departure
for
religious
evolution
but
for
both
it
is
in
the
nature
either
of
man
or
of
the
universe
that
we
must
look
for
the
germ
of
the
grand
opposition
which
separates
the
profane
from
the
sacred
but
such
an
enterprise
is
impossible
it
supposes
a
veritable
creation
a
fact
of
common
experience
can
not
give
us
the
idea
of
something
whose
characteristic
is
to
be
outside
the
world
of
common
experience
a
man
as
he
appears
to
himself
in
his
dreams
is
only
a
man
natural
forces
as
our
senses
perceive
them
are
only
natural
forces
howsoever
great
their
intensity
may
be
hence
comes
the
common
criticism
which
we
address
to
both
doctrines
in
order
to
explain
how
these
pretended
data
of
religious
thought
have
been
able
to
take
a
sacred
character
which
has
no
objective
foundation
it
would
be
necessary
to
admit
that
a
whole
world
of
delusive
representations
has
superimposed
itself
upon
the
other
denatured
it
to
the
point
of
making
it
unrecognizable
and
substituted
a
pure
hallucination
for
reality
here
it
is
the
illusions
of
the
dream
which
brought
about
this
transfiguration
there
it
is
the
brilliant
and
vain
company
of
images
evoked
by
the
word
but
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
it
is
necessary
to
regard
religion
as
the
product
of
a
delirious
imagination
thus
one
positive
conclusion
is
arrived
at
as
the
result
of
this
critical
examination
since
neither
man
nor
nature
have
of
themselves
a
sacred
character
they
must
get
it
from
another
source
aside
from
the
human
individual
and
the
physical
world
there
should
be
some
other
reality
in
relation
to
which
this
variety
of
delirium
which
all
religion
is
in
a
sense
has
a
significance
and
an
objective
value
in
other
words
beyond
those
which
we
have
called
animistic
and
naturistic
there
should
be
another
sort
of
cult
more
fundamental
and
more
primitive
of
which
the
first
are
only
derived
forms
or
particular
aspects
in
fact
this
cult
does
exist
it
is
the
one
to
which
ethnologists
have
given
the
name
of
totemism
i
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
word
totem
appeared
in
ethnographical
literature
it
is
found
for
the
first
time
in
the
book
of
an
indian
interpreter
j
long
which
was
published
in
london
in
for
nearly
a
half
a
century
totemism
was
known
only
as
something
exclusively
american
it
was
only
in
that
grey
in
a
passage
which
has
remained
celebrated
pointed
out
the
existence
of
wholly
similar
practices
in
australia
from
that
time
on
scholars
began
to
realize
that
they
were
in
the
presence
of
a
system
of
a
certain
generality
but
they
saw
there
only
an
essentially
archaic
institution
an
ethnographical
curiosity
having
no
great
interest
for
the
historian
maclennan
was
the
first
who
undertook
to
attach
totemism
to
the
general
history
of
humanity
in
a
series
of
articles
in
the
he
set
himself
to
show
that
totemism
was
not
only
a
religion
but
one
from
which
were
derived
a
multitude
of
beliefs
and
practices
which
are
found
in
much
more
advanced
religious
systems
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
make
it
the
source
of
all
the
and
cults
which
are
found
among
ancient
peoples
certainly
this
extension
of
totemism
was
abusive
the
cults
of
animals
and
plants
depend
upon
numerous
causes
which
can
not
be
reduced
to
one
without
the
error
of
too
great
simplicity
but
this
error
by
its
very
exaggerations
had
at
least
the
advantage
that
it
put
into
evidence
the
historical
importance
of
totemism
students
of
american
totemism
had
already
known
for
a
long
time
that
this
form
of
religion
was
most
intimately
united
to
a
determined
social
organization
that
its
basis
is
the
division
of
the
social
group
into
clans
in
in
his
lewis
morgan
undertook
to
make
a
study
of
it
to
determine
its
distinctive
characteristics
and
at
the
same
time
to
point
out
its
generality
among
the
indian
tribes
of
north
and
central
america
at
nearly
the
same
moment
and
even
following
the
direct
suggestion
of
morgan
fison
and
howitt
established
the
existence
of
the
same
social
system
in
australia
as
well
as
its
relations
with
totemism
under
the
influence
of
these
directing
ideas
observations
could
be
made
with
better
method
the
researches
which
the
american
bureau
of
ethnology
undertook
played
an
important
part
in
the
advance
of
these
studies
by
the
documents
were
sufficiently
numerous
and
significant
to
make
frazer
consider
it
time
to
unite
them
and
present
them
to
us
in
a
systematic
form
such
is
the
object
of
his
little
book
where
the
system
is
studied
both
as
a
religion
and
as
a
legal
institution
but
this
study
was
purely
descriptive
no
effort
was
made
to
explain
totemism
or
to
understand
its
fundamental
notions
robertson
smith
is
the
first
who
undertook
this
work
of
elaboration
he
realized
more
clearly
than
any
of
his
predecessors
how
rich
this
crude
and
confused
religion
is
in
germs
for
the
future
it
is
true
that
maclennan
had
already
connected
it
with
the
great
religions
of
antiquity
but
that
was
merely
because
he
thought
he
had
found
here
and
there
the
cult
of
animals
or
plants
now
if
we
reduce
totemism
to
a
sort
of
animal
or
plant
worship
we
have
seen
only
its
most
superficial
aspect
we
have
even
misunderstood
its
real
nature
going
beyond
the
mere
letter
of
the
totemic
beliefs
smith
set
himself
to
find
the
fundamental
principles
upon
which
they
depend
in
his
book
upon
and
marriage
in
early
he
had
already
pointed
out
that
totemism
supposes
a
likeness
in
nature
either
natural
or
acquired
of
men
and
animals
or
plants
in
his
religion
of
the
he
makes
this
same
idea
the
first
origin
of
the
entire
sacrificial
system
it
is
to
totemism
that
humanity
owes
the
principle
of
the
communion
meal
it
is
true
that
the
theory
of
smith
can
now
be
shown
it
is
no
longer
adequate
for
the
facts
actually
known
but
for
all
that
it
contains
an
ingenious
theory
and
has
exercised
a
most
fertile
influence
upon
the
science
of
religions
the
of
frazer
is
inspired
by
these
same
ideas
for
totemism
which
maclennan
had
attached
to
the
religions
of
classical
antiquity
and
smith
to
the
religions
of
the
semitic
peoples
is
here
connected
to
the
european
the
schools
of
maclennan
and
morgan
are
thus
united
to
that
of
mannhardt
during
this
time
the
american
tradition
continued
to
develop
with
an
independence
which
it
has
kept
up
until
very
recent
times
three
groups
of
societies
were
the
special
object
of
the
researches
which
were
concerned
with
totemism
these
are
first
certain
tribes
of
the
the
tlinkit
the
haida
the
kwakiutl
the
salish
and
the
tsimshian
then
the
great
nation
of
the
sioux
and
finally
the
pueblo
indians
in
the
part
of
the
united
states
the
first
were
studied
principally
by
dall
krause
boas
swanton
hill
tout
the
second
by
dorsey
the
last
by
mindeleff
stevenson
and
cushing
but
however
rich
the
harvest
of
facts
thus
gathered
in
all
parts
of
the
country
may
have
been
the
documents
at
our
disposal
were
still
fragmentary
though
the
american
religions
contain
numerous
traces
of
totemism
they
have
passed
the
stage
of
real
totemism
on
the
other
hand
observations
in
australia
had
brought
little
more
than
scattered
beliefs
and
isolated
rites
initiation
rituals
and
interdictions
relative
to
totemism
it
was
with
facts
taken
from
all
these
sources
that
frazer
attempted
to
draw
a
picture
of
totemism
in
its
entirety
whatever
may
be
the
incontestable
merit
of
the
reconstruction
undertaken
in
such
circumstances
it
could
not
help
being
incomplete
and
hypothetical
a
totemic
religion
in
complete
action
had
not
yet
been
observed
it
is
only
in
very
recent
years
that
this
serious
deficiency
has
been
repaired
two
observers
of
remarkable
ability
baldwin
spencer
and
gillen
discovered
in
the
interior
of
the
australian
continent
a
considerable
number
of
tribes
whose
basis
and
unity
was
founded
in
totemic
beliefs
the
results
of
their
observations
have
been
published
in
two
works
which
have
given
a
new
life
to
the
study
of
totemism
the
first
of
these
native
tribes
of
central
deals
with
the
more
central
of
these
tribes
the
arunta
the
luritcha
and
a
little
farther
to
the
south
on
the
shores
of
lake
eyre
the
urabunna
the
second
which
is
entitled
northern
tribes
of
central
deals
with
the
societies
north
of
the
urabunna
occupying
the
territory
between
macdonnell
range
and
carpenter
gulf
among
the
principal
of
these
we
may
mention
the
unmatjera
the
kaitish
the
warramunga
the
worgaia
the
tjingilli
the
binbinga
the
walpari
the
gnanji
and
finally
on
the
very
shores
of
the
gulf
the
mara
and
the
anula
more
recently
a
german
missionary
carl
strehlow
who
has
also
passed
long
years
in
these
same
central
australian
societies
has
commenced
to
publish
his
own
observations
on
two
of
these
tribes
the
aranda
and
the
loritja
the
arunta
and
luritcha
of
spencer
and
gillen
having
well
mastered
the
language
spoken
by
these
peoples
strehlow
has
been
able
to
bring
us
a
large
number
of
totemic
myths
and
religious
songs
which
are
given
us
for
the
most
part
in
the
original
text
in
spite
of
some
differences
of
detail
which
are
easily
explained
and
whose
importance
has
been
greatly
exaggerated
we
shall
see
that
the
observations
of
strehlow
though
completing
making
more
precise
and
sometimes
even
rectifying
those
of
spencer
and
gillen
confirm
them
in
all
that
is
essential
these
discoveries
have
given
rise
to
an
abundant
literature
to
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
return
the
works
of
spencer
and
gillen
especially
have
exercised
a
considerable
influence
not
only
because
they
were
the
oldest
but
also
because
the
facts
were
there
presented
in
a
systematic
form
which
was
of
a
nature
to
give
a
direction
to
later
studies
and
to
stimulate
speculation
their
results
were
commented
upon
discussed
and
interpreted
in
all
possible
manners
at
this
same
time
howitt
whose
fragmentary
studies
were
scattered
in
a
number
of
different
publications
undertook
to
do
for
the
southern
tribes
what
spencer
and
gillen
had
done
for
those
of
the
centre
in
his
tribes
of
he
gives
us
a
view
of
the
social
organization
of
the
peoples
who
occupy
southern
australia
new
south
wales
and
a
good
part
of
queensland
the
progress
thus
realized
suggested
to
frazer
the
idea
of
completing
his
totemism
by
a
sort
of
compendium
where
would
be
brought
together
all
the
important
documents
which
are
concerned
either
with
the
totemic
religion
or
the
family
and
matrimonial
organization
which
rightly
or
wrongly
is
believed
to
be
connected
with
this
religion
the
purpose
of
this
book
is
not
to
give
us
a
general
and
systematic
view
of
totemism
but
rather
to
put
the
materials
necessary
for
a
construction
of
this
sort
at
the
disposition
of
scholars
the
facts
are
here
arranged
in
a
strictly
ethnographical
and
geographical
order
each
continent
and
within
the
continent
each
tribe
or
ethnic
group
is
studied
separately
though
so
extended
a
study
where
so
many
diverse
peoples
are
successively
passed
in
review
could
hardly
be
equally
thorough
in
all
its
parts
still
it
is
a
useful
to
consult
and
one
which
can
aid
greatly
in
facilitating
researches
ii
from
this
historical
résumé
it
is
clear
that
australia
is
the
most
favourable
field
for
the
study
of
totemism
and
therefore
we
shall
make
it
the
principal
area
of
our
observations
in
his
frazer
sought
especially
to
collect
all
the
traces
of
totemism
which
could
be
found
in
history
or
ethnography
he
was
thus
led
to
include
in
his
study
societies
the
nature
and
degree
of
whose
culture
differs
most
widely
ancient
egypt
arabia
and
greece
and
the
southern
slavs
are
found
there
side
by
side
with
the
tribes
of
australia
and
america
this
manner
of
procedure
is
not
at
all
surprising
for
a
disciple
of
the
anthropological
school
for
this
school
does
not
seek
to
locate
religions
in
the
social
environments
of
which
they
are
a
part
and
to
differentiate
them
according
to
the
different
environments
to
which
they
are
thus
connected
but
rather
as
is
indicated
by
the
name
which
it
has
taken
to
itself
its
purpose
is
to
go
beyond
the
national
and
historical
differences
to
the
universal
and
really
human
bases
of
the
religious
life
it
is
supposed
that
man
has
a
religious
nature
of
himself
in
virtue
of
his
own
constitution
and
independently
of
all
social
conditions
and
they
propose
to
study
this
for
researches
of
this
sort
all
peoples
can
be
called
upon
equally
well
it
is
true
that
they
prefer
the
more
primitive
peoples
because
this
fundamental
nature
is
more
apt
to
be
unaltered
here
but
since
it
is
found
equally
well
among
the
most
civilized
peoples
it
is
but
natural
that
they
too
should
be
called
as
witnesses
consequently
all
those
who
pass
as
being
not
too
far
removed
from
the
origins
and
who
are
confusedly
lumped
together
under
the
rather
imprecise
rubric
of
are
put
on
the
same
plane
and
consulted
indifferently
since
from
this
point
of
view
facts
have
an
interest
only
in
proportion
to
their
generality
they
consider
themselves
obliged
to
collect
as
large
a
number
as
possible
of
them
the
circle
of
comparisons
could
not
become
too
large
our
method
will
not
be
such
a
one
for
several
reasons
in
the
first
place
for
the
sociologist
as
for
the
historian
social
facts
vary
with
the
social
system
of
which
they
form
a
part
they
can
not
be
understood
when
detached
from
it
this
is
why
two
facts
which
come
from
two
different
societies
can
not
be
profitably
compared
merely
because
they
seem
to
resemble
each
other
it
is
necessary
that
these
societies
themselves
resemble
each
other
that
is
to
say
that
they
be
only
varieties
of
the
same
species
the
comparative
method
would
be
impossible
if
social
types
did
not
exist
and
it
can
not
be
usefully
applied
except
within
a
single
type
what
errors
have
not
been
committed
for
having
neglected
this
precept
it
is
thus
that
facts
have
been
unduly
connected
with
each
other
which
in
spite
of
exterior
resemblances
really
have
neither
the
same
sense
nor
the
same
importance
the
primitive
democracy
and
that
of
the
collectivism
of
inferior
societies
and
actual
socialistic
tendencies
the
monogamy
which
is
frequent
in
australian
tribes
and
that
sanctioned
by
our
laws
etc
even
in
the
work
of
frazer
such
confusions
are
found
it
frequently
happens
that
he
assimilates
simple
rites
of
to
practices
that
are
really
totemic
though
the
distance
sometimes
very
great
which
separates
the
two
social
systems
would
exclude
all
idea
of
assimilation
then
if
we
do
not
wish
to
fall
into
these
same
errors
instead
of
scattering
our
researches
over
all
the
societies
possible
we
must
concentrate
them
upon
one
clearly
determined
type
it
is
even
necessary
that
this
concentration
be
as
close
as
possible
one
can
not
usefully
compare
facts
with
which
he
is
not
perfectly
well
acquainted
but
when
he
undertakes
to
include
all
sorts
of
societies
and
civilizations
one
can
not
know
any
of
them
with
the
necessary
thoroughness
when
he
assembles
facts
from
every
country
in
order
to
compare
them
he
is
obliged
to
take
them
hastily
without
having
either
the
means
or
the
time
to
carefully
criticize
them
tumultuous
and
summary
comparisons
result
which
discredit
the
comparative
method
with
many
intelligent
persons
it
can
give
serious
results
only
when
it
is
applied
to
so
limited
a
number
of
societies
that
each
of
them
can
be
studied
with
sufficient
precision
the
essential
thing
is
to
choose
those
where
investigations
have
the
greatest
chance
to
be
fruitful
also
the
value
of
the
facts
is
much
more
important
than
their
number
in
our
eyes
the
question
whether
totemism
has
been
more
or
less
universal
or
not
is
quite
secondary
if
it
interests
us
it
does
so
before
all
because
in
studying
it
we
hope
to
discover
relations
of
a
nature
to
make
us
understand
better
what
religion
is
now
to
establish
these
relations
it
is
neither
necessary
nor
always
useful
to
heap
up
numerous
experiences
upon
each
other
it
is
much
more
important
to
have
a
few
that
are
well
studied
and
really
significant
one
single
fact
may
make
a
law
appear
where
a
multitude
of
imprecise
and
vague
observations
would
only
produce
confusion
in
every
science
the
scholar
would
be
overwhelmed
by
the
facts
which
present
themselves
to
him
if
he
did
not
make
a
choice
among
them
it
is
necessary
that
he
distinguish
those
which
promise
to
be
the
most
instructive
that
he
concentrate
his
attention
upon
these
and
that
he
temporarily
leave
the
others
to
one
side
that
is
why
with
one
reservation
which
will
be
indicated
below
we
propose
to
limit
our
research
to
australian
societies
they
fulfil
all
the
conditions
which
were
just
enumerated
they
are
perfectly
homogeneous
for
though
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
varieties
among
them
they
all
belong
to
one
common
type
this
homogeneity
is
even
so
great
that
the
forms
of
social
organization
are
not
only
the
same
but
that
they
are
even
designated
by
identical
or
equivalent
names
in
a
multitude
of
tribes
sometimes
very
distant
from
each
other
also
australian
totemism
is
the
variety
for
which
our
documents
are
the
most
complete
finally
that
which
we
propose
to
study
in
this
work
is
the
most
primitive
and
simple
religion
which
it
is
possible
to
find
it
is
therefore
natural
that
to
discover
it
we
address
ourselves
to
societies
as
slightly
evolved
as
possible
for
it
is
evidently
there
that
we
have
the
greatest
chance
of
finding
it
and
studying
it
well
now
there
are
no
societies
which
present
this
characteristic
to
a
higher
degree
than
the
australian
ones
not
only
is
their
civilization
most
rudimentary
the
house
and
even
the
hut
are
still
unknown
but
also
their
organization
is
the
most
primitive
and
simple
which
is
actually
known
it
is
that
which
we
have
elsewhere
called
on
a
basis
of
in
the
next
chapter
we
shall
have
occasion
to
restate
its
essential
traits
however
though
making
australia
the
principal
field
of
our
research
we
think
it
best
not
to
leave
completely
aside
the
societies
where
totemism
was
first
discovered
that
is
to
say
the
indian
tribes
of
north
america
this
extension
of
the
field
of
comparison
has
nothing
about
it
which
is
not
legitimate
undoubtedly
these
people
are
more
advanced
than
those
of
australia
their
civilization
has
become
much
more
advanced
men
there
live
in
houses
or
under
tents
and
there
are
even
fortified
villages
the
size
of
the
society
is
much
greater
and
centralization
which
is
completely
lacking
in
australia
is
beginning
to
appear
there
we
find
vast
confederations
such
as
that
of
the
iroquois
under
one
central
authority
sometimes
a
complicated
system
of
differentiated
classes
arranged
in
a
hierarchy
is
found
however
the
essential
lines
of
the
social
structure
remain
the
same
as
those
in
australia
it
is
always
the
organization
on
a
basis
of
clans
thus
we
are
not
in
the
presence
of
two
different
types
but
of
two
varieties
of
a
single
type
which
are
still
very
close
to
each
other
they
represent
two
successive
moments
of
a
single
evolution
so
their
homogeneousness
is
still
great
enough
to
permit
comparisons
also
these
comparisons
may
have
their
utility
just
because
their
civilization
is
more
advanced
than
that
of
the
australians
certain
phases
of
the
social
organization
which
is
common
to
both
can
be
studied
more
easily
among
the
first
than
among
the
second
as
long
as
men
are
still
making
their
first
steps
in
the
art
of
expressing
their
thought
it
is
not
easy
for
the
observer
to
perceive
that
which
moves
them
for
there
is
nothing
to
translate
clearly
that
which
passes
in
these
obscure
minds
which
have
only
a
confused
and
ephemeral
knowledge
of
themselves
for
example
religious
symbols
then
consist
only
in
formless
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
whose
sense
it
is
not
easy
to
divine
as
we
shall
see
there
are
many
gestures
and
movements
by
which
interior
states
express
themselves
but
being
essentially
ephemeral
they
readily
elude
observation
that
is
why
totemism
was
discovered
earlier
in
america
than
in
australia
it
was
much
more
visible
there
though
it
held
relatively
less
place
in
the
totality
of
the
religious
life
also
wherever
beliefs
and
institutions
do
not
take
a
somewhat
definite
material
form
they
are
more
liable
to
change
under
the
influence
of
the
slightest
circumstances
or
to
become
wholly
effaced
from
the
memory
thus
the
australian
clans
frequently
have
something
floating
and
protean
about
them
while
the
corresponding
organization
in
america
has
a
greater
stability
and
more
clearly
defined
contours
thus
though
american
totemism
is
further
removed
from
its
origins
than
that
of
australia
still
there
are
important
characteristics
of
which
it
has
better
kept
the
memory
in
the
second
place
in
order
to
understand
an
institution
it
is
frequently
well
to
follow
it
into
the
advanced
stages
of
its
evolution
for
sometimes
it
is
only
when
it
is
fully
developed
that
its
real
signification
appears
with
the
greatest
clearness
in
this
way
also
american
totemism
since
it
has
a
long
history
behind
it
could
serve
to
clarify
certain
aspects
of
australian
totemism
at
the
same
time
it
will
put
us
in
a
better
condition
to
see
how
totemism
is
bound
up
with
the
forms
which
follow
and
to
mark
its
place
in
the
general
historical
development
of
religion
so
in
the
discussions
which
follow
we
shall
not
forbid
ourselves
the
use
of
certain
facts
borrowed
from
the
indian
societies
of
north
america
but
we
are
not
going
to
study
american
totemism
here
such
a
study
must
be
made
directly
and
by
itself
and
can
not
be
mixed
with
the
one
which
we
are
undertaking
it
raises
other
problems
and
implies
a
wholly
different
set
of
special
investigations
we
shall
have
recourse
to
american
facts
merely
in
a
supplementary
way
and
only
when
they
seem
to
be
able
to
make
us
understand
australian
facts
to
advantage
it
is
these
latter
which
constitute
the
real
and
immediate
object
of
our
researches
book
ii
the
elementary
beliefs
chapter
i
totemic
beliefs
totem
as
name
and
as
owing
to
its
nature
our
study
will
include
two
parts
since
every
religion
is
made
up
of
intellectual
conceptions
and
ritual
practices
we
must
deal
successively
with
the
beliefs
and
rites
which
compose
the
totemic
religion
these
two
elements
of
the
religious
life
are
too
closely
connected
with
each
other
to
allow
of
any
radical
separation
in
principle
the
cult
is
derived
from
the
beliefs
yet
it
reacts
upon
them
the
myth
is
frequently
modelled
after
the
rite
in
order
to
account
for
it
especially
when
its
sense
is
no
longer
apparent
on
the
other
hand
there
are
beliefs
which
are
clearly
manifested
only
through
the
rites
which
express
them
so
these
two
parts
of
our
analysis
can
not
fail
to
overlap
however
these
two
orders
of
facts
are
so
different
that
it
is
indispensable
to
study
them
separately
and
since
it
is
impossible
to
understand
anything
about
a
religion
while
unacquainted
with
the
ideas
upon
which
it
rests
we
must
seek
to
become
acquainted
with
these
latter
first
of
all
but
it
is
not
our
intention
to
retrace
all
the
speculations
into
which
the
religious
thought
even
of
the
australians
alone
has
run
the
things
we
wish
to
reach
are
the
elementary
notions
at
the
basis
of
the
religion
but
there
is
no
need
of
following
them
through
all
the
development
sometimes
very
confused
which
the
mythological
imagination
of
these
peoples
has
given
them
we
shall
make
use
of
myths
when
they
enable
us
to
understand
these
fundamental
ideas
better
but
we
shall
not
make
mythology
itself
the
subject
of
our
studies
in
so
far
as
this
is
a
work
of
art
it
does
not
fall
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
simple
science
of
religions
also
the
intellectual
evolution
from
which
it
results
is
of
too
great
a
complexity
to
be
studied
indirectly
and
from
a
foreign
point
of
view
it
constitutes
a
very
difficult
problem
which
must
be
treated
by
itself
for
itself
and
with
a
method
peculiar
to
itself
among
the
beliefs
upon
which
totemism
rests
the
most
important
are
naturally
those
concerning
the
totem
it
is
with
these
that
we
must
begin
i
at
the
basis
of
nearly
all
the
australian
tribes
we
find
a
group
which
holds
a
preponderating
place
in
the
collective
life
this
is
the
clan
two
essential
traits
characterize
it
in
the
first
place
the
individuals
who
compose
it
consider
themselves
united
by
a
bond
of
kinship
but
one
which
is
of
a
very
special
nature
this
relationship
does
not
come
from
the
fact
that
they
have
definite
blood
connections
with
one
another
they
are
relatives
from
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
the
same
name
they
are
not
fathers
and
mothers
sons
or
daughters
uncles
or
nephews
of
one
another
in
the
sense
which
we
now
give
these
words
yet
they
think
of
themselves
as
forming
a
single
family
which
is
large
or
small
according
to
the
dimensions
of
the
clan
merely
because
they
are
collectively
designated
by
the
same
word
when
we
say
that
they
regard
themselves
as
a
single
family
we
do
so
because
they
recognize
duties
towards
each
other
which
are
identical
with
those
which
have
always
been
incumbent
upon
kindred
such
duties
as
aid
vengeance
mourning
the
obligation
not
to
marry
among
themselves
etc
by
this
first
characteristic
the
clan
does
not
differ
from
the
roman
or
the
greek
greek
genos
for
this
relationship
also
came
merely
from
the
fact
that
all
the
members
of
the
had
the
same
name
the
and
in
one
sense
the
is
a
clan
but
it
is
a
variety
which
should
not
be
confounded
with
the
australian
clan
this
latter
is
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
its
name
is
also
the
name
of
a
determined
species
of
material
things
with
which
it
believes
that
it
has
very
particular
relations
the
nature
of
which
we
shall
presently
describe
they
are
especially
relations
of
kinship
the
species
of
things
which
serves
to
designate
the
clan
collectively
is
called
its
the
totem
of
the
clan
is
also
that
of
each
of
its
members
each
clan
has
its
totem
which
belongs
to
it
alone
two
different
clans
of
the
same
tribe
can
not
have
the
same
in
fact
one
is
a
member
of
a
clan
merely
because
he
has
a
certain
name
all
who
bear
this
name
are
members
of
it
for
that
very
reason
in
whatever
manner
they
may
be
spread
over
the
tribal
territory
they
all
have
the
same
relations
of
kinship
with
one
another
consequently
two
groups
having
the
same
totem
can
only
be
two
sections
of
the
same
clan
undoubtedly
it
frequently
happens
that
all
of
a
clan
does
not
reside
in
the
same
locality
but
has
representatives
in
several
different
places
however
this
lack
of
a
geographical
basis
does
not
cause
its
unity
to
be
the
less
keenly
felt
in
regard
to
the
word
totem
we
may
say
that
it
is
the
one
employed
by
the
ojibway
an
algonquin
tribe
to
designate
the
sort
of
thing
whose
name
the
clan
bears
although
this
expression
is
not
at
all
australian
and
is
found
only
in
one
single
society
in
america
ethnographers
have
definitely
adopted
it
and
use
it
to
denote
in
a
general
way
the
system
which
we
are
describing
schoolcraft
was
the
first
to
extend
the
meaning
of
the
word
thus
and
to
speak
of
a
totemic
system
this
extension
of
which
there
are
examples
enough
in
ethnography
is
not
without
inconveniences
it
is
not
normal
for
an
institution
of
this
importance
to
bear
a
chance
name
taken
from
a
strictly
local
dialect
and
bringing
to
mind
none
of
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
thing
it
designates
but
this
way
of
employing
the
word
is
so
universally
accepted
that
it
would
be
an
excess
of
purism
to
rise
against
this
usage
in
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
cases
the
objects
which
serve
as
totems
belong
either
to
the
animal
or
the
vegetable
kingdom
but
especially
to
the
former
inanimate
things
are
much
more
rarely
employed
out
of
more
than
totemic
names
collected
by
howitt
among
the
tribes
of
australia
there
are
scarcely
forty
which
are
not
the
names
of
plants
or
animals
these
are
the
clouds
rain
hail
frost
the
moon
the
sun
the
wind
the
autumn
the
summer
the
winter
certain
stars
thunder
fire
smoke
water
or
the
sea
it
is
noticeable
how
small
a
place
is
given
to
celestial
bodies
and
more
generally
to
the
great
cosmic
phenomena
which
were
destined
to
so
great
a
fortune
in
later
religious
development
among
all
the
clans
of
which
howitt
speaks
there
were
only
two
which
had
the
moon
as
totem
two
the
sun
three
a
star
three
the
thunder
two
the
lightning
the
rain
is
a
single
exception
it
on
the
contrary
is
very
frequent
these
are
the
totems
which
can
be
spoken
of
as
normal
but
totemism
has
its
abnormalities
as
well
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
totem
is
not
a
whole
object
but
the
part
of
an
object
this
fact
appears
rather
rarely
in
australia
howitt
cites
only
one
example
however
it
may
well
be
that
this
is
found
with
a
certain
frequency
in
the
tribes
where
the
totemic
groups
are
excessively
subdivided
it
might
be
said
that
the
totems
had
to
break
themselves
up
in
order
to
be
able
to
furnish
names
to
these
numerous
divisions
this
is
what
seems
to
have
taken
place
among
the
arunta
and
the
loritja
strehlow
has
collected
totems
in
these
two
societies
of
which
many
are
not
an
animal
species
but
some
particular
organ
of
the
animal
of
the
species
such
as
the
tail
or
stomach
of
an
opossum
the
fat
of
the
kangaroo
etc
we
have
seen
that
normally
the
totem
is
not
an
individual
but
a
species
or
a
variety
it
is
not
such
and
such
a
kangaroo
or
crow
but
the
kangaroo
or
crow
in
general
sometimes
however
it
is
a
particular
object
first
of
all
this
is
necessarily
the
case
when
the
thing
serving
as
totem
is
unique
in
its
class
as
the
sun
the
moon
such
or
such
a
constellation
etc
it
also
happens
that
clans
take
their
names
from
certain
geographical
irregularities
or
depressions
of
the
land
from
a
certain
etc
it
is
true
that
we
have
only
a
small
number
of
examples
of
this
in
australia
but
strehlow
does
mention
some
but
the
very
causes
which
have
given
rise
to
these
abnormal
totems
show
that
they
are
of
a
relatively
recent
origin
in
fact
what
has
made
certain
geographical
features
of
the
land
become
totems
is
that
a
mythical
ancestor
is
supposed
to
have
stopped
there
or
to
have
performed
some
act
of
his
legendary
life
there
but
at
the
same
time
these
ancestors
are
represented
in
the
myths
as
themselves
belonging
to
clans
which
had
perfectly
regular
totems
that
is
to
say
ones
taken
from
the
animal
or
vegetable
kingdoms
therefore
the
totemic
names
thus
commemorating
the
acts
and
performances
of
these
heroes
can
not
be
primitive
they
belong
to
a
form
of
totemism
that
is
already
derived
and
deviated
it
is
even
permissible
to
ask
if
the
meteorological
totems
have
not
a
similar
origin
for
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
stars
are
frequently
identified
with
the
ancestors
of
the
mythological
epoch
sometimes
but
no
less
exceptionally
it
is
an
ancestor
or
a
group
of
ancestors
which
serves
as
totem
directly
in
this
case
the
clan
takes
its
name
not
from
a
thing
or
a
species
of
real
things
but
from
a
purely
mythical
being
spencer
and
gillen
had
already
mentioned
two
or
three
totems
of
this
sort
among
the
warramunga
and
among
the
tjingilli
there
are
clans
which
bear
the
name
of
an
ancestor
named
thaballa
who
seems
to
be
gaiety
incarnate
another
warramunga
clan
bears
the
name
of
a
huge
fabulous
serpent
named
wollunqua
from
which
the
clan
considers
itself
descended
we
owe
other
similar
facts
to
strehlow
in
any
case
it
is
easy
enough
to
see
what
probably
took
place
under
the
influence
of
diverse
causes
and
by
the
very
development
of
mythological
thought
the
collective
and
impersonal
totem
became
effaced
before
certain
mythical
personages
who
advanced
to
the
first
rank
and
became
totems
themselves
howsoever
interesting
these
different
irregularities
may
be
they
contain
nothing
which
forces
us
to
modify
our
definition
of
a
totem
they
are
not
as
has
sometimes
been
believed
different
varieties
of
totems
which
are
more
or
less
irreducible
into
each
other
or
into
the
normal
totem
such
as
we
have
defined
it
they
are
merely
secondary
and
sometimes
even
aberrant
forms
of
a
single
notion
which
is
much
more
general
and
there
is
every
ground
for
believing
it
the
more
primitive
the
manner
in
which
the
name
is
acquired
is
more
important
for
the
organization
and
recruiting
of
the
clan
than
for
religion
it
belongs
to
the
sociology
of
the
family
rather
than
to
religious
sociology
so
we
shall
confine
ourselves
to
indicating
summarily
the
most
essential
principles
which
regulate
the
matter
in
the
different
tribes
three
different
systems
are
in
use
in
a
great
number
or
it
might
even
be
said
in
the
greater
number
of
the
societies
the
child
takes
the
totem
of
its
mother
by
right
of
birth
this
is
what
happens
among
the
dieri
and
the
urabunna
of
the
centre
of
southern
australia
the
wotjobaluk
and
the
of
victoria
the
kamilaroi
the
wiradjuri
the
wonghibon
and
the
euahlayi
of
new
south
wales
and
the
wakelbura
the
and
the
kurnandaburi
of
queensland
to
mention
only
the
most
important
names
in
this
case
owing
to
a
law
of
exogamy
the
mother
is
necessarily
of
a
different
totem
from
her
husband
and
on
the
other
hand
as
she
lives
in
his
community
the
members
of
a
single
totem
are
necessarily
dispersed
in
different
localities
according
to
the
chances
of
their
marriages
as
a
result
the
totemic
group
lacks
a
territorial
base
elsewhere
the
totem
is
transmitted
in
the
paternal
line
in
this
case
if
the
child
remains
with
his
father
the
local
group
is
largely
made
up
of
people
belonging
to
a
single
totem
only
the
married
women
there
represent
foreign
totems
in
other
words
each
locality
has
its
particular
totem
up
until
recent
times
this
scheme
of
organization
was
found
in
australia
only
among
the
tribes
where
totemism
was
in
decadence
such
as
the
narrinyeri
where
the
totem
has
almost
no
religious
character
at
all
any
more
it
was
therefore
possible
to
believe
that
there
was
a
close
connection
between
the
totemic
system
and
descent
in
the
uterine
line
but
spencer
and
gillen
have
observed
in
the
northern
part
of
central
australia
a
whole
group
of
tribes
where
the
totemic
religion
is
still
practised
but
where
the
transmission
of
the
totem
is
in
the
paternal
line
these
are
the
warramunga
the
quanji
the
umbia
the
binbinga
the
mara
and
the
anula
finally
a
third
combination
is
the
one
observed
among
the
arunta
and
loritja
here
the
totem
of
the
child
is
not
necessarily
either
that
of
the
mother
or
that
of
the
father
it
is
that
of
a
mythical
ancestor
who
came
by
processes
which
the
observers
recount
in
different
ways
and
mysteriously
fecundated
the
mother
at
the
moment
of
conception
a
special
process
makes
it
possible
to
learn
which
ancestor
it
was
and
to
which
totemic
group
he
belonged
but
since
it
was
only
chance
which
determined
that
this
ancestor
happened
to
be
near
the
mother
rather
than
another
the
totem
of
the
child
is
thus
found
to
depend
finally
upon
fortuitous
circumstances
outside
of
and
above
the
totems
of
clans
there
are
totems
of
phratries
which
though
not
differing
from
the
former
in
nature
must
none
the
less
be
distinguished
from
them
a
phratry
is
a
group
of
clans
which
are
united
to
each
other
by
particular
bonds
of
fraternity
ordinarily
the
australian
tribe
is
divided
into
two
phratries
between
which
the
different
clans
are
distributed
of
course
there
are
some
tribes
where
this
organization
has
disappeared
but
everything
leads
us
to
believe
that
it
was
once
general
in
any
case
there
are
no
tribes
in
australia
where
the
number
of
phratries
is
greater
than
two
now
in
nearly
all
the
cases
where
the
phratries
have
a
name
whose
meaning
has
been
established
this
name
is
that
of
an
animal
it
would
therefore
seem
that
it
is
a
totem
this
has
been
well
demonstrated
in
a
recent
work
by
a
lang
thus
among
the
gournditch
victoria
the
phratries
are
called
krokitch
and
kaputch
the
former
of
the
words
designates
the
white
cockatoo
and
the
latter
the
black
cockatoo
the
same
expressions
are
found
again
among
the
buandik
and
the
wotjobaluk
among
the
wurunjerri
the
names
employed
are
bunjil
and
waang
which
designate
the
and
the
crow
the
words
mukwara
and
kilpara
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
in
a
large
number
of
tribes
of
new
south
wales
they
designate
the
same
birds
it
is
also
the
and
the
crow
which
have
given
their
names
to
the
two
phratries
of
the
ngarigo
and
the
wolgal
among
the
kuinmurbura
it
is
the
white
cockatoo
and
the
crow
many
other
examples
might
be
cited
thus
we
are
led
to
regard
the
phratry
as
an
ancient
clan
which
has
been
dismembered
the
actual
clans
are
the
product
of
this
dismemberment
and
the
solidarity
which
unites
them
is
a
souvenir
of
their
primitive
unity
it
is
true
that
in
certain
tribes
the
phratries
no
longer
have
special
names
as
it
seems
in
others
where
these
names
exist
their
meaning
is
no
longer
known
even
to
the
members
but
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
this
the
phratries
are
certainly
a
primitive
institution
for
they
are
everywhere
in
a
state
of
regression
their
descendants
the
clans
have
passed
to
the
first
rank
so
it
is
but
natural
that
the
names
which
they
bore
should
have
been
effaced
from
memory
little
by
little
when
they
were
no
longer
understood
for
they
must
belong
to
a
very
archaic
language
no
longer
in
use
this
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
in
many
cases
where
we
know
the
animal
whose
name
the
phratry
bears
the
word
designating
this
animal
in
the
current
language
is
very
different
from
the
one
employed
here
between
the
totem
of
the
phratry
and
the
totems
of
the
clans
there
exists
a
sort
of
relation
of
subordination
in
fact
in
principle
each
clan
belongs
to
one
and
only
one
phratry
it
is
very
exceptional
that
it
has
representatives
in
the
other
phratry
this
is
not
met
with
at
all
except
among
certain
central
tribes
notably
the
arunta
also
even
where
owing
to
disturbing
influences
overlappings
of
this
sort
have
taken
place
the
great
part
of
the
clan
is
included
entirely
within
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
groups
of
the
tribe
only
a
small
minority
is
to
be
found
in
the
other
one
as
a
rule
then
the
two
phratries
do
not
overlap
each
other
consequently
the
list
of
totems
which
an
individual
may
have
is
predetermined
by
the
phratry
to
which
he
belongs
in
other
words
the
phratry
is
like
a
species
of
which
the
clans
are
varieties
we
shall
presently
see
that
this
comparison
is
not
purely
metaphorical
in
addition
to
the
phratries
and
clans
another
secondary
group
is
frequently
met
with
in
australian
societies
which
is
not
without
a
certain
individuality
these
are
the
matrimonial
classes
by
this
name
they
designate
certain
subdivisions
of
the
phratry
whose
number
varies
with
the
tribe
there
are
sometimes
two
and
sometimes
four
per
phratry
their
recruiting
and
operation
are
regulated
by
the
two
following
principles
in
the
first
place
each
generation
in
a
phratry
belongs
to
different
clans
from
the
immediately
preceding
one
thus
when
there
are
only
two
classes
per
phratry
they
necessarily
alternate
with
each
other
every
generation
the
children
make
up
the
class
of
which
their
parents
are
not
members
but
grandchildren
are
of
the
same
class
as
their
grandparents
thus
among
the
kamilaroi
the
kupathin
phratry
has
two
classes
ippai
and
kumbo
the
dilby
phratry
two
others
which
are
called
murri
and
kubbi
as
descent
is
in
the
uterine
line
the
child
is
in
the
phratry
of
its
mother
if
she
is
a
kupathin
the
child
will
be
one
also
but
if
she
is
of
the
ippai
class
he
will
be
a
kumbo
if
the
child
is
a
girl
her
children
will
again
be
in
the
ippai
class
likewise
the
children
of
the
women
of
the
murri
class
will
be
in
the
kubbi
class
and
the
children
of
the
kubbi
women
will
be
murri
again
when
there
are
four
classes
per
phratry
instead
of
two
the
system
is
naturally
more
complex
but
the
principle
is
the
same
the
four
classes
form
two
couples
of
two
classes
each
and
these
two
classes
alternate
with
each
other
every
generation
in
the
manner
just
indicated
secondly
the
members
of
one
class
can
in
principle
marry
into
only
one
of
the
classes
of
the
other
phratry
the
ippai
must
marry
into
the
kubbi
class
and
the
murri
into
the
kumbo
class
it
is
because
this
organization
profoundly
affects
matrimonial
relations
that
we
give
the
group
the
name
of
matrimonial
class
now
it
may
be
asked
whether
these
classes
do
not
sometimes
have
totems
like
the
phratries
and
clans
this
question
is
raised
by
the
fact
that
in
certain
tribes
of
queensland
each
matrimonial
class
has
dietetic
restrictions
that
are
peculiar
to
it
the
individuals
who
compose
it
must
abstain
from
eating
the
flesh
of
certain
animals
which
the
others
may
consume
freely
are
these
animals
not
totems
but
dietetic
restrictions
are
not
the
characteristic
marks
of
totemism
the
totem
is
a
name
first
of
all
and
then
as
we
shall
see
an
emblem
now
in
the
societies
of
which
we
just
spoke
there
are
no
matrimonial
classes
which
bear
the
name
of
an
animal
or
plant
or
which
have
an
emblem
of
course
it
is
possible
that
these
restrictions
are
indirectly
derived
from
totemism
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
animals
which
these
interdictions
protect
were
once
the
totems
of
clans
which
have
since
disappeared
while
the
matrimonial
classes
remained
it
is
certain
that
they
have
a
force
of
endurance
which
the
clans
do
not
have
then
these
interdictions
deprived
of
their
original
field
may
have
spread
themselves
out
over
the
entire
class
since
there
were
no
other
groups
to
which
they
could
be
attached
but
it
is
clear
that
if
this
regulation
was
born
of
totemism
it
represents
only
an
enfeebled
and
denatured
form
of
it
all
that
has
been
said
of
the
totem
in
australian
societies
is
equally
applicable
to
the
indian
tribes
of
north
america
the
only
difference
is
that
among
these
latter
the
totemic
organization
has
a
strictness
of
outline
and
a
stability
which
are
not
found
in
australia
the
australian
clans
are
not
only
very
numerous
but
in
a
single
tribe
their
number
is
almost
unlimited
observers
cite
some
of
them
as
examples
but
without
ever
succeeding
in
giving
us
a
complete
list
this
is
because
the
list
is
never
definitely
terminated
the
same
process
of
dismemberment
which
broke
up
the
original
phratries
and
give
birth
to
clans
properly
still
continues
within
these
latter
as
a
result
of
this
progressive
crumbling
a
clan
frequently
has
only
a
very
small
effective
force
in
america
on
the
contrary
the
totemic
system
has
better
defined
forms
although
the
tribes
there
are
considerably
larger
on
the
average
the
clans
are
less
numerous
a
single
tribe
rarely
has
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
and
frequently
less
each
of
them
is
therefore
a
much
more
important
group
but
above
all
their
number
is
fixed
they
know
their
exact
number
and
they
it
tell
to
us
this
difference
is
due
to
the
superiority
of
their
social
economy
from
the
moment
when
these
tribes
were
observed
for
the
first
time
the
social
groups
were
strongly
attached
to
the
soil
and
consequently
better
able
to
resist
the
decentralizing
forces
which
assailed
them
at
the
same
time
the
society
had
too
keen
a
sentiment
of
its
unity
to
remain
unconscious
of
itself
and
of
the
parts
out
of
which
it
was
composed
the
example
of
america
thus
enables
us
to
explain
even
better
the
organization
at
the
base
of
the
clans
we
would
take
a
mistaken
view
if
we
judged
this
only
on
the
present
conditions
in
australia
in
fact
it
is
in
a
state
of
change
and
dissolution
there
which
is
not
at
all
normal
it
is
much
rather
the
product
of
a
degeneration
which
we
see
due
both
to
the
natural
decay
of
time
and
the
disorganizing
effect
of
the
whites
to
be
sure
it
is
hardly
probable
that
the
australian
clans
ever
had
the
dimensions
and
solid
structure
of
the
american
ones
but
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
the
distance
between
them
was
less
considerable
than
it
is
for
the
american
societies
would
never
have
succeeded
in
making
so
solid
a
structure
if
the
clans
had
always
been
of
so
fluid
and
inconsistent
a
nature
this
greater
stability
has
even
enabled
the
archaic
system
of
phratries
to
maintain
itself
in
america
with
a
clearness
and
a
relief
no
longer
to
be
found
in
australia
we
have
just
seen
that
in
the
latter
continent
the
phratry
is
everywhere
in
a
state
of
decadence
very
frequently
it
is
nothing
more
than
an
anonymous
group
when
it
has
a
name
this
is
either
no
longer
understood
or
in
any
case
it
can
not
mean
a
great
deal
to
the
native
since
it
is
borrowed
from
a
foreign
language
or
from
one
no
longer
spoken
thus
we
have
been
able
to
infer
the
existence
of
totems
for
phratries
only
from
a
few
survivals
which
for
the
most
part
are
so
slightly
marked
that
they
have
escaped
the
attention
of
many
observers
in
certain
parts
of
america
on
the
contrary
this
institution
has
retained
its
primitive
importance
the
tribes
of
the
coast
the
tlinkit
and
the
haida
especially
have
now
attained
a
relatively
advanced
civilization
yet
they
are
divided
into
two
phratries
which
are
subdivided
into
a
certain
number
of
clans
the
phratries
of
the
crow
and
the
wolf
among
the
tlinkit
of
the
eagle
and
the
crow
among
the
haida
and
this
division
is
not
merely
nominal
it
corresponds
to
an
state
of
tribal
customs
and
is
deeply
marked
with
the
tribal
life
the
moral
distance
separating
the
clans
is
very
slight
in
comparison
with
that
separating
the
phratries
the
name
of
each
is
not
a
word
whose
sense
is
forgotten
or
only
vaguely
known
it
is
a
totem
in
the
full
sense
of
the
term
they
have
all
its
essential
attributes
such
as
will
be
described
below
consequently
upon
this
point
also
american
tribes
must
not
be
neglected
for
we
can
study
the
totems
of
phratries
directly
there
while
australia
offers
only
obscure
vestiges
of
them
ii
but
the
totem
is
not
merely
a
name
it
is
an
emblem
a
veritable
whose
analogies
with
the
arms
of
heraldry
have
often
been
remarked
in
speaking
of
the
australians
grey
says
each
family
adopt
an
animal
or
vegetable
as
their
crest
and
sign
and
what
grey
calls
a
family
is
incontestably
a
clan
also
fison
and
howitt
say
the
australian
divisions
show
that
the
totem
is
in
the
first
place
the
badge
of
a
group
schoolcraft
says
the
same
thing
about
the
totems
of
the
indians
of
north
america
the
totem
is
in
fact
a
design
which
corresponds
to
the
heraldic
emblems
of
civilized
nations
and
each
person
is
authorized
to
bear
it
as
a
proof
of
the
identity
of
the
family
to
which
it
belongs
this
is
proved
by
the
real
etymology
of
the
word
which
is
derived
from
which
means
village
or
the
residence
of
a
family
group
thus
when
the
indians
entered
into
relations
with
the
europeans
and
contracts
were
formed
between
them
it
was
with
its
totem
that
each
clan
sealed
the
treaties
thus
concluded
the
nobles
of
the
feudal
period
carved
engraved
and
designed
in
every
way
their
upon
the
walls
of
their
castles
their
arms
and
every
sort
of
object
that
belonged
to
them
the
blacks
of
australia
and
the
indians
of
north
america
do
the
same
thing
with
their
totems
the
indians
who
accompanied
samuel
hearne
painted
their
totems
on
their
shields
before
going
into
battle
according
to
charlevoix
in
time
of
war
certain
tribes
of
indians
had
veritable
ensigns
made
of
bits
of
bark
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
pole
upon
which
the
totems
were
represented
among
the
tlinkit
when
a
conflict
breaks
out
between
two
clans
the
champions
of
the
two
hostile
groups
wear
helmets
over
their
heads
upon
which
are
painted
their
respective
totems
among
the
iroquois
they
put
the
skin
of
the
animal
which
serves
as
totem
upon
each
wigwam
as
a
mark
of
the
clan
according
to
another
observer
the
animal
was
stuffed
and
set
up
before
the
door
among
the
wyandot
each
clan
has
its
own
ornaments
and
its
distinctive
paintings
among
the
omaha
and
among
the
sioux
generally
the
totem
is
painted
on
the
tent
wherever
the
society
has
become
sedentary
where
the
tent
is
replaced
by
the
house
and
where
the
plastic
arts
are
more
fully
developed
the
totem
is
engraved
upon
the
woodwork
and
upon
the
walls
this
is
what
happens
for
example
among
the
haida
the
tsimshian
the
salish
and
the
tlinkit
a
very
particular
ornament
of
the
house
among
the
tlinkit
says
krause
is
the
totemic
animal
forms
sometimes
combined
with
human
forms
are
engraved
upon
the
posts
at
the
sides
of
the
door
of
entry
which
are
as
high
as
yards
they
are
generally
painted
with
very
bright
colours
however
these
totemic
decorations
are
not
very
numerous
in
the
tlinkit
village
they
are
found
almost
solely
before
the
houses
of
the
chiefs
and
rich
men
they
are
much
more
frequent
in
the
neighbouring
tribe
of
the
haida
here
there
are
always
several
for
each
house
with
its
many
sculptured
posts
arising
on
every
hand
sometimes
to
a
great
height
a
haida
village
gives
the
impression
of
a
sacred
city
all
bristling
with
belfries
or
little
minarets
among
the
salish
the
totem
is
frequently
represented
upon
the
interior
walls
of
the
house
elsewhere
it
is
found
upon
the
canoes
the
utensils
of
every
sort
and
the
funeral
piles
the
preceding
examples
are
taken
exclusively
from
the
indians
of
north
america
this
is
because
sculpture
engravings
and
permanent
figurations
are
not
possible
except
where
the
technique
of
the
plastic
arts
has
reached
a
degree
of
perfection
to
which
the
australian
tribes
have
not
yet
attained
consequently
the
totemic
representations
of
the
sort
which
we
just
mentioned
are
rarer
and
less
apparent
in
australia
than
in
america
however
cases
of
them
are
cited
among
the
warramunga
at
the
end
of
the
burial
ceremonies
the
bones
of
the
dead
man
are
interred
after
they
have
been
dried
and
reduced
to
powder
beside
the
place
where
they
are
deposited
a
figure
representing
the
totem
is
traced
upon
the
ground
among
the
mara
and
the
anula
the
body
is
placed
in
a
piece
of
hollow
wood
decorated
with
designs
characteristic
of
the
totem
in
new
south
wales
oxley
found
engravings
upon
the
trees
near
the
tomb
where
a
native
was
buried
to
which
brough
smyth
attributes
a
totemic
character
the
natives
of
the
upper
darling
carve
totemic
images
upon
their
shields
according
to
collins
nearly
all
the
utensils
are
covered
with
ornaments
which
probably
have
the
same
significance
figures
of
the
same
sort
are
found
upon
the
rocks
these
totemic
designs
may
even
be
more
frequent
than
it
seems
for
owing
to
reasons
which
will
be
discussed
below
it
is
not
always
easy
to
see
what
their
real
meaning
is
these
different
facts
give
us
an
idea
of
the
considerable
place
held
by
the
totem
in
the
social
life
of
the
primitives
however
up
to
the
present
it
has
appeared
to
us
as
something
relatively
outside
of
the
man
for
it
is
only
upon
external
things
that
we
have
seen
it
represented
but
totemic
images
are
not
placed
only
upon
the
walls
of
their
houses
the
sides
of
their
canoes
their
arms
their
utensils
and
their
tombs
they
are
also
found
on
the
bodies
of
the
men
they
do
not
put
their
merely
upon
the
things
which
they
possess
but
they
put
it
upon
their
persons
they
imprint
it
upon
their
flesh
it
becomes
a
part
of
them
and
this
world
of
representations
is
even
by
far
the
more
important
one
in
fact
it
is
a
very
general
rule
that
the
members
of
each
clan
seek
to
give
themselves
the
external
aspect
of
their
totem
at
certain
religious
festivals
among
the
tlinkit
the
person
who
is
to
direct
the
ceremonies
wears
a
garment
which
represents
either
wholly
or
in
part
the
body
of
the
animal
whose
name
he
bears
these
same
usages
are
also
found
in
all
the
of
america
they
are
found
again
among
the
minnitaree
when
they
go
into
combat
and
among
the
indians
of
the
pueblos
elsewhere
when
the
totem
is
a
bird
men
wear
the
feathers
of
this
bird
on
their
heads
among
the
iowa
each
clan
has
a
special
fashion
of
cutting
the
hair
in
the
eagle
clan
two
large
tufts
are
arranged
on
the
front
of
the
head
while
there
is
another
one
behind
in
the
buffalo
clan
they
are
arranged
in
the
form
of
horns
among
the
omaha
analogous
arrangements
are
found
each
clan
has
its
own
in
the
turtle
clan
for
example
the
hair
is
all
shaved
off
except
six
bunches
two
on
each
side
of
the
head
one
in
front
and
one
behind
in
such
a
way
as
to
imitate
the
legs
the
head
and
the
tail
of
the
animal
but
it
is
more
frequently
upon
the
body
itself
that
the
totemic
mark
is
stamped
for
this
is
a
way
of
representation
within
the
capacity
of
even
the
least
advanced
societies
it
has
sometimes
been
asked
whether
the
common
rite
of
knocking
out
a
young
man
two
upper
teeth
at
the
age
of
puberty
does
not
have
the
object
of
reproducing
the
form
of
the
totem
the
fact
is
not
established
but
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
the
natives
themselves
sometimes
explain
the
custom
thus
for
example
among
the
arunta
the
extraction
of
teeth
is
practised
only
in
the
clans
of
the
rain
and
of
water
now
according
to
tradition
the
object
of
this
operation
is
to
make
their
faces
look
like
certain
black
clouds
with
light
borders
which
are
believed
to
announce
the
speedy
arrival
of
rain
and
which
are
therefore
considered
things
of
the
same
family
this
is
a
proof
that
the
native
himself
is
conscious
that
the
object
of
these
deformations
is
to
give
him
at
least
conventionally
the
aspect
of
his
totem
among
these
same
arunta
in
the
course
of
the
rites
of
certain
gashes
are
cut
upon
the
sisters
and
the
future
wife
of
the
novice
scars
result
from
these
whose
form
is
also
represented
upon
a
certain
sacred
object
of
which
we
shall
speak
presently
and
which
is
called
the
as
we
shall
see
the
lines
thus
drawn
upon
the
are
emblematic
of
the
totem
among
the
kaitish
the
euro
is
believed
to
be
closely
connected
with
the
rain
the
men
of
the
rain
clan
wear
little
made
of
euro
teeth
among
the
yerkla
during
the
initiation
the
young
man
is
given
a
certain
number
of
slashes
which
leave
scars
the
number
and
form
of
these
varies
with
the
totems
an
informer
of
fison
mentions
the
same
fact
in
the
tribes
observed
by
him
according
to
howitt
a
relationship
of
the
same
sort
exists
among
the
dieri
between
certain
arrangements
of
scars
and
the
water
totem
among
the
indians
of
the
it
is
a
very
general
custom
for
them
to
tattoo
themselves
with
the
totem
but
even
if
the
tattooings
which
are
made
by
mutilations
or
scars
do
not
always
have
a
totemic
significance
it
is
different
with
simple
designs
drawn
upon
the
body
they
are
generally
representations
of
the
totem
it
is
true
that
the
native
does
not
carry
them
every
day
when
he
is
occupied
with
purely
economic
occupations
or
when
the
small
family
groups
scatter
to
hunt
or
fish
he
does
not
bother
with
all
this
paraphernalia
which
is
quite
complicated
but
when
the
clans
unite
to
live
a
common
life
and
to
assist
at
the
religious
ceremonies
together
then
he
must
adorn
himself
as
we
shall
see
each
of
the
ceremonies
concerns
a
particular
totem
and
in
theory
the
rites
which
are
connected
with
a
totem
can
be
performed
only
by
the
men
of
that
totem
now
those
who
perform
who
take
the
part
of
officiants
and
sometimes
even
those
who
assist
as
spectators
always
have
designs
representing
the
totem
on
their
bodies
one
of
the
principal
rites
of
initiation
by
which
a
young
man
enters
into
the
religious
life
of
the
tribe
consists
in
painting
the
totemic
symbol
on
his
body
it
is
true
that
among
the
arunta
the
design
thus
traced
does
not
always
and
necessarily
represent
the
totem
of
the
initiated
but
these
are
exceptions
due
undoubtedly
to
the
disturbed
state
of
the
totemic
organization
of
this
tribe
also
even
among
the
arunta
at
the
most
solemn
moment
of
the
initiation
which
is
its
crown
and
consecration
when
the
neophyte
is
allowed
to
enter
the
sanctuary
where
all
the
sacred
objects
belonging
to
the
clan
are
preserved
an
emblematic
painting
is
placed
upon
him
this
time
it
is
the
totem
of
the
young
man
which
is
thus
represented
the
bonds
which
unite
the
individual
to
his
totem
are
even
so
strong
that
in
the
tribes
on
the
coast
of
north
america
the
emblem
of
the
clan
is
painted
not
only
upon
the
living
but
also
upon
the
dead
before
a
corpse
is
interred
they
put
the
totemic
mark
upon
it
iii
these
totemic
decorations
enable
us
to
see
that
the
totem
is
not
merely
a
name
and
an
emblem
it
is
in
the
course
of
the
religious
ceremonies
that
they
are
employed
they
are
a
part
of
the
liturgy
so
while
the
totem
is
a
collective
label
it
also
has
a
religious
character
in
fact
it
is
in
connection
with
it
that
things
are
classified
as
sacred
or
profane
it
is
the
very
type
of
sacred
thing
the
tribes
of
central
australia
especially
the
arunta
the
loritja
the
kaitish
the
unmatjera
and
the
ilpirra
make
constant
use
of
certain
instruments
in
their
rites
which
are
called
the
by
the
arunta
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
or
the
according
to
strehlow
they
are
pieces
of
wood
or
bits
of
polished
stone
of
a
great
variety
of
forms
but
generally
oval
or
oblong
each
totemic
group
has
a
more
or
less
important
collection
of
these
each
of
these
is
engraved
a
design
representing
the
totem
of
this
same
a
certain
number
of
the
churinga
have
a
hole
at
one
end
through
which
goes
a
thread
made
of
human
hair
or
that
of
an
opossum
those
which
are
made
of
wood
and
are
pierced
in
this
way
serve
for
exactly
the
same
purposes
as
those
instruments
of
the
cult
to
which
english
ethnographers
have
given
the
name
of
by
means
of
the
thread
by
which
they
are
suspended
they
are
whirled
rapidly
in
the
air
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
a
sort
of
humming
identical
with
that
made
by
the
toys
of
this
name
still
used
by
our
children
this
deafening
noise
has
a
ritual
significance
and
accompanies
all
ceremonies
of
any
importance
these
sorts
of
churinga
are
real
but
there
are
others
which
are
not
made
of
wood
and
are
not
pierced
consequently
they
can
not
be
employed
in
this
way
nevertheless
they
inspire
the
same
religious
sentiments
in
fact
every
churinga
for
whatever
purpose
it
may
be
employed
is
counted
among
the
eminently
sacred
things
there
are
none
which
surpass
it
in
religious
dignity
this
is
indicated
even
by
the
word
which
is
used
to
designate
them
it
is
not
only
a
substantive
but
also
an
adjective
meaning
sacred
also
among
the
several
names
which
each
arunta
has
there
is
one
so
sacred
that
it
must
not
be
revealed
to
a
stranger
it
is
pronounced
but
rarely
and
then
in
a
low
voice
and
a
sort
of
mysterious
murmur
now
this
name
is
called
the
aritna
means
name
in
general
the
word
churinga
is
used
to
designate
all
ritual
acts
for
example
signifies
the
cult
of
the
emu
churinga
when
used
substantively
therefore
designates
the
thing
whose
essential
characteristic
is
sacredness
profane
persons
that
is
to
say
women
and
young
men
not
yet
initiated
into
the
religious
life
may
not
touch
or
even
see
the
churinga
they
are
only
allowed
to
look
at
it
from
a
distance
and
even
this
is
only
on
rare
occasions
the
churinga
are
piously
kept
in
a
special
place
which
the
arunta
call
the
this
is
a
cave
or
a
sort
of
cavern
hidden
in
a
deserted
place
the
entrance
is
carefully
closed
by
means
of
stones
so
cleverly
placed
that
a
stranger
going
past
it
could
not
suspect
that
the
religious
treasury
of
the
clan
was
so
near
to
him
the
sacred
character
of
the
churinga
is
so
great
that
it
communicates
itself
to
the
locality
where
they
are
stored
the
women
and
the
uninitiated
can
not
approach
it
it
is
only
after
their
initiation
is
completely
finished
that
the
young
men
have
access
to
it
there
are
some
who
are
not
esteemed
worthy
of
this
favour
except
after
years
of
trial
the
religious
nature
radiates
to
a
distance
and
communicates
itself
to
all
the
surroundings
everything
near
by
participates
in
this
same
nature
and
is
therefore
withdrawn
from
profane
touch
is
one
man
pursued
by
another
if
he
succeeds
in
reaching
the
ertnatulunga
he
is
saved
he
can
not
be
seized
there
even
a
wounded
animal
which
takes
refuge
there
must
be
respected
quarrels
are
forbidden
there
it
is
a
place
of
peace
as
is
said
in
the
germanic
societies
it
is
a
sanctuary
of
the
totemic
group
it
is
a
veritable
place
of
asylum
but
the
virtues
of
the
churinga
are
not
manifested
merely
by
the
way
in
which
it
keeps
the
profane
at
a
distance
if
it
is
thus
isolated
it
is
because
it
is
something
of
a
high
religious
value
whose
loss
would
injure
the
group
and
the
individuals
severely
it
has
all
sorts
of
marvellous
properties
by
contact
it
heals
wounds
especially
those
resulting
from
circumcision
it
has
the
same
power
over
sickness
it
is
useful
for
making
the
beard
grow
it
confers
important
powers
over
the
totemic
species
whose
normal
reproduction
it
ensures
it
gives
men
force
courage
and
perseverance
while
on
the
other
hand
it
depresses
and
weakens
their
enemies
this
latter
belief
is
so
firmly
rooted
that
when
two
combatants
stand
pitted
against
one
another
if
one
sees
that
the
other
has
brought
churinga
against
him
he
loses
confidence
and
his
defeat
is
certain
thus
there
is
no
ritual
instrument
which
has
a
more
important
place
in
the
religious
ceremonies
by
means
of
various
sorts
of
anointings
their
powers
are
communicated
either
to
the
officiants
or
to
the
assistants
to
bring
this
about
they
are
rubbed
over
the
members
and
stomach
of
the
faithful
after
being
covered
with
grease
or
sometimes
they
are
covered
with
a
down
which
flies
away
and
scatters
itself
in
every
direction
when
they
are
whirled
this
a
way
of
disseminating
the
virtues
which
are
in
them
but
they
are
not
useful
merely
to
individuals
the
fate
of
the
clan
as
a
whole
is
bound
up
with
theirs
their
loss
is
a
disaster
it
is
the
greatest
misfortune
which
can
happen
to
the
group
sometimes
they
leave
the
ertnatulunga
for
example
when
they
are
loaned
to
other
groups
then
follows
a
veritable
public
mourning
for
two
weeks
the
people
of
the
totem
weep
and
lament
covering
their
bodies
with
white
clay
just
as
they
do
when
they
have
lost
a
relative
and
the
churinga
are
not
left
at
the
free
disposition
of
everybody
the
ertnatulunga
where
they
are
kept
is
placed
under
the
control
of
the
chief
of
the
group
it
is
true
that
each
individual
has
special
rights
to
some
of
them
yet
though
he
is
their
proprietor
in
a
sense
he
can
not
make
use
of
them
except
with
the
consent
and
under
the
direction
of
the
chief
it
is
a
collective
treasury
it
is
the
sacred
ark
of
the
clan
the
devotion
of
which
they
are
the
object
shows
the
high
price
that
is
attached
to
them
the
respect
with
which
they
are
handled
is
shown
by
the
solemnity
of
the
movements
they
are
taken
care
of
they
are
greased
rubbed
polished
and
when
they
are
moved
from
one
locality
to
another
it
is
in
the
midst
of
ceremonies
which
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
this
displacement
is
regarded
as
an
act
of
the
highest
importance
now
in
themselves
the
churinga
are
objects
of
wood
and
stone
like
all
others
they
are
distinguished
from
profane
things
of
the
same
sort
by
only
one
particularity
this
is
that
the
totemic
mark
is
drawn
or
engraved
upon
them
so
it
is
this
mark
and
this
alone
which
gives
them
their
sacred
character
it
is
true
that
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
the
churinga
serve
as
the
residence
of
an
ancestor
soul
and
that
it
is
the
presence
of
this
soul
which
confers
these
properties
while
declaring
this
interpretation
inexact
strehlow
in
his
turn
proposes
another
which
does
not
differ
materially
from
the
other
he
claims
that
the
churinga
are
considered
the
image
of
the
ancestor
body
or
the
body
itself
so
in
any
case
it
would
be
sentiments
inspired
by
the
ancestor
which
fix
themselves
upon
the
material
object
and
convert
it
into
a
sort
of
fetish
but
in
the
first
place
both
conceptions
which
by
the
way
scarcely
differ
except
in
the
letter
of
the
myth
have
obviously
been
made
up
afterwards
to
account
for
the
sacred
character
of
the
churinga
in
the
constitution
of
these
pieces
of
wood
and
bits
of
stone
and
in
their
external
appearance
there
is
nothing
which
predestines
them
to
be
considered
the
seat
of
an
ancestral
soul
or
the
image
of
his
body
so
if
men
have
imagined
this
myth
it
was
in
order
to
explain
the
religious
respect
which
these
things
inspired
in
them
and
the
respect
was
not
determined
by
the
myth
this
explanation
like
so
many
mythological
explanations
resolves
the
question
only
by
repeating
it
in
slightly
different
terms
for
saying
that
the
churinga
is
sacred
and
saying
that
it
has
such
and
such
a
relation
with
a
sacred
being
is
merely
to
proclaim
the
same
fact
in
two
different
ways
it
is
not
accounting
for
them
moreover
according
to
the
avowal
of
spencer
and
gillen
there
are
some
churinga
among
the
arunta
which
are
made
by
the
old
men
of
the
group
to
the
knowledge
of
and
before
the
eyes
of
all
these
obviously
do
not
come
from
the
great
ancestors
however
except
for
certain
differences
of
degree
they
have
the
same
power
as
the
others
and
are
preserved
in
the
same
manner
finally
there
are
whole
tribes
where
the
churinga
is
never
associated
with
a
spirit
its
religious
nature
comes
to
it
then
from
some
other
source
and
whence
could
it
come
if
not
from
the
totemic
stamp
which
it
bears
it
is
to
this
image
therefore
that
the
demonstrations
of
the
rite
are
really
addressed
it
is
this
which
sanctifies
the
object
upon
which
it
is
carved
among
the
arunta
and
the
neighbouring
tribes
there
are
two
other
liturgical
instruments
closely
connected
with
the
totem
and
the
churinga
itself
which
ordinarily
enters
into
their
composition
they
are
the
and
the
the
nurtunja
which
is
found
among
the
northern
arunta
and
their
immediate
neighbours
is
made
up
principally
of
a
vertical
support
which
is
either
a
single
lance
or
several
lances
united
into
a
bundle
or
of
a
simple
pole
bunches
of
grass
are
fastened
all
around
it
by
means
of
belts
or
little
cords
made
of
hair
above
this
down
is
placed
arranged
either
in
circles
or
in
parallel
lines
which
run
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
support
the
top
is
decorated
with
the
plumes
of
an
this
is
only
the
most
general
and
typical
form
in
particular
cases
it
has
all
sorts
of
variations
the
waninga
which
is
found
only
among
the
southern
arunta
the
urabunna
and
the
loritja
has
no
one
unique
model
either
reduced
to
its
most
essential
elements
it
too
consists
in
a
vertical
support
formed
by
a
long
stick
or
by
a
lance
several
yards
high
with
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
two
in
the
former
case
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
cross
cords
made
either
of
human
hair
or
opossum
or
bandicoot
fur
diagonally
cross
the
space
included
between
the
arms
of
the
cross
and
the
extremities
of
the
central
axis
as
they
are
quite
close
to
each
other
they
form
a
network
in
the
form
of
a
lozenge
when
there
are
two
these
cords
go
from
one
to
the
other
and
from
these
to
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
support
they
are
sometimes
covered
with
a
layer
of
down
thick
enough
to
conceal
the
foundation
thus
the
waninga
has
the
appearance
of
a
veritable
flag
now
the
nurtunja
and
the
waninga
which
figure
in
a
multitude
of
important
rites
are
the
object
of
a
religious
respect
quite
like
that
inspired
by
the
churinga
the
process
of
their
manufacture
and
erection
is
conducted
with
the
greatest
solemnity
fixed
in
the
earth
or
carried
by
an
officiant
they
mark
the
central
point
of
the
ceremony
it
is
about
them
that
the
dances
take
place
and
the
rites
are
performed
in
the
course
of
the
initiation
the
novice
is
led
to
the
foot
of
a
nurtunja
erected
for
the
occasion
someone
says
to
him
there
is
the
nurtunja
of
your
father
many
young
men
have
already
been
made
by
it
after
that
the
initiate
must
kiss
the
nurtunja
by
this
kiss
he
enters
into
relations
with
the
religious
principle
which
resides
there
it
is
a
veritable
communion
which
should
give
the
young
man
the
force
required
to
support
the
terrible
operation
of
the
nurtunja
also
plays
a
considerable
rôle
in
the
mythology
of
these
societies
the
myths
relate
that
in
the
fabulous
times
of
the
great
ancestors
the
territory
of
the
tribe
was
overrun
in
every
direction
by
companies
composed
exclusively
of
individuals
of
the
same
totem
each
of
these
troops
had
a
nurtunja
with
it
when
it
stopped
to
camp
before
scattering
to
hunt
the
members
fixed
their
nurtunja
in
the
ground
from
the
top
of
which
their
churinga
was
suspended
that
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
they
confided
the
most
precious
things
they
had
to
it
it
was
at
the
same
time
a
sort
of
standard
which
served
as
a
for
the
group
one
can
not
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
analogies
between
the
nurtunja
and
the
sacred
post
of
the
omaha
now
its
sacred
character
can
come
from
only
one
cause
that
is
that
it
represents
the
totem
materially
the
vertical
lines
or
rings
of
down
which
cover
it
and
even
the
cords
of
different
colours
which
fasten
the
arms
of
the
waninga
to
the
central
axis
are
not
arranged
arbitrarily
according
to
the
taste
of
the
makers
they
must
conform
to
a
type
strictly
determined
by
tradition
which
in
the
minds
of
the
natives
represents
the
totem
here
we
can
not
ask
as
we
did
in
the
case
of
the
churinga
whether
the
veneration
accorded
to
this
instrument
of
the
cult
is
not
merely
the
reflex
of
that
inspired
by
the
ancestors
for
it
is
a
rule
that
each
nurtunja
and
each
waninga
last
only
during
the
ceremony
where
they
are
used
they
are
made
all
over
again
every
time
that
it
is
necessary
and
when
the
rite
is
once
accomplished
they
are
stripped
of
their
ornaments
and
the
elements
out
of
which
they
are
made
are
scattered
they
are
nothing
more
than
images
and
temporary
images
at
that
of
the
totem
and
consequently
it
is
on
this
ground
and
on
this
ground
alone
that
they
play
a
religious
rôle
so
the
churinga
the
nurtunja
and
the
waninga
owe
their
religious
nature
solely
to
the
fact
that
they
bear
the
totemic
emblem
it
is
the
emblem
that
is
sacred
it
keeps
this
character
no
matter
where
it
may
be
represented
sometimes
it
is
painted
upon
rocks
these
paintings
are
called
sacred
drawings
the
decorations
with
which
the
officiants
and
assistants
at
the
religious
ceremonies
adorn
themselves
have
the
same
name
women
and
children
may
not
see
them
in
the
course
of
certain
rites
the
totem
is
drawn
upon
the
ground
the
way
in
which
this
is
done
bears
witness
to
the
sentiments
inspired
by
this
design
and
the
high
value
attributed
to
it
it
is
traced
upon
a
place
that
has
been
previously
sprinkled
and
saturated
with
human
blood
and
we
shall
presently
see
that
the
blood
is
in
itself
a
sacred
liquid
serving
for
pious
uses
only
when
the
design
has
been
made
the
faithful
remain
seated
on
the
ground
before
it
in
an
attitude
of
the
purest
devotion
if
we
give
the
word
a
sense
corresponding
to
the
mentality
of
the
primitive
we
may
say
that
they
adore
it
this
enables
us
to
understand
how
the
totemic
blazon
has
remained
something
very
precious
for
the
indians
of
north
america
it
is
always
surrounded
with
a
sort
of
religious
halo
but
if
we
are
seeking
to
understand
how
it
comes
that
these
totemic
representations
are
so
sacred
it
is
not
without
interest
to
see
what
they
consist
in
among
the
indians
of
north
america
they
are
painted
engraved
or
carved
images
which
attempt
to
reproduce
as
faithfully
as
possible
the
external
aspect
of
the
totemic
animal
the
means
employed
are
those
which
we
use
in
similar
circumstances
except
that
they
are
generally
cruder
but
it
is
not
the
same
in
australia
and
it
is
in
the
australian
societies
that
we
must
seek
the
origin
of
these
representations
although
the
australian
may
show
himself
sufficiently
capable
of
imitating
the
forms
of
things
in
a
rudimentary
way
sacred
representations
generally
seem
to
show
no
ambitions
in
this
line
they
consist
essentially
in
geometrical
designs
drawn
upon
the
churinga
the
nurtunga
rocks
the
ground
or
the
human
body
they
are
either
straight
or
curved
lines
painted
in
different
ways
and
the
whole
having
only
a
conventional
meaning
the
connection
between
the
figure
and
the
thing
represented
is
so
remote
and
indirect
that
it
can
not
be
seen
except
when
it
is
pointed
out
only
the
members
of
the
clan
can
say
what
meaning
is
attached
to
such
and
such
combinations
of
lines
men
and
women
are
generally
represented
by
semicircles
and
animals
by
whole
circles
or
spirals
the
tracks
of
men
or
animals
by
lines
of
points
etc
the
meaning
of
the
figures
thus
obtained
is
so
arbitrary
that
a
single
design
may
have
two
different
meanings
for
the
men
of
two
different
totems
representing
one
animal
here
and
another
animal
or
plant
there
this
is
perhaps
still
more
apparent
with
the
nurtunja
and
waninga
each
of
them
represents
a
different
totem
but
the
few
and
simple
elements
which
enter
into
their
composition
do
not
allow
a
great
variety
of
combinations
the
result
is
that
two
nurtunja
may
have
exactly
the
same
appearance
and
yet
express
two
things
as
different
as
a
gum
tree
and
an
emu
when
a
nurtunja
is
made
it
is
given
a
meaning
which
it
keeps
during
the
whole
ceremony
but
which
in
the
last
resort
is
fixed
by
convention
these
facts
prove
that
if
the
australian
is
so
strongly
inclined
to
represent
his
totem
it
is
in
order
not
to
have
a
portrait
of
it
before
his
eyes
which
would
constantly
renew
the
sensation
of
it
it
is
merely
because
he
feels
the
need
of
representing
the
idea
which
he
forms
of
it
by
means
of
material
and
external
signs
no
matter
what
these
signs
may
be
we
are
not
yet
ready
to
attempt
to
understand
what
has
thus
caused
the
primitive
to
write
his
idea
of
his
totem
upon
his
person
and
upon
different
objects
but
it
is
important
to
state
at
once
the
nature
of
the
need
which
has
given
rise
to
these
numerous
representations
chapter
ii
totemic
beliefs
totemic
animal
and
but
totemic
images
are
not
the
only
sacred
things
there
are
real
things
which
are
also
the
object
of
rites
because
of
the
relations
which
they
have
with
the
totem
before
all
others
are
the
beings
of
the
totemic
species
and
the
members
of
the
clan
i
first
of
all
since
the
designs
which
represent
the
totem
arouse
religious
sentiments
it
is
natural
that
the
things
whose
aspect
these
designs
reproduce
should
have
this
same
property
at
least
to
a
certain
degree
for
the
most
part
these
are
animals
or
plants
the
profane
function
of
vegetables
and
even
of
animals
is
ordinarily
to
serve
as
food
then
the
sacred
character
of
the
totemic
animal
or
plant
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
it
is
forbidden
to
eat
them
it
is
true
that
since
they
are
sacred
things
they
can
enter
into
the
composition
of
certain
mystical
repasts
and
we
shall
see
in
fact
that
they
sometimes
serve
as
veritable
sacraments
yet
normally
they
can
not
be
used
for
everyday
consumption
whoever
oversteps
this
rule
exposes
himself
to
grave
dangers
it
is
not
that
the
group
always
intervenes
to
punish
this
infraction
artificially
it
is
believed
that
the
sacrilege
produces
death
automatically
a
redoubtable
principle
is
held
to
reside
in
the
totemic
plant
or
animal
which
can
not
enter
into
the
profane
organism
without
disorganizing
it
or
destroying
it
in
certain
tribes
at
least
only
the
old
men
are
free
from
this
prohibition
we
shall
see
the
reason
for
this
later
however
if
this
prohibition
is
formal
in
a
large
number
of
tribes
with
certain
exceptions
which
will
be
mentioned
later
it
is
incontestable
that
it
tends
to
weaken
as
the
old
totemic
organization
is
disturbed
but
the
restrictions
which
remain
even
then
prove
that
these
attenuations
are
not
admitted
without
difficulty
for
example
when
it
is
permitted
to
eat
the
plant
or
animal
that
serves
as
totem
it
is
not
possible
to
do
so
freely
only
a
little
bit
may
be
taken
at
a
time
to
go
beyond
this
amount
is
a
ritual
fault
that
has
grave
consequences
elsewhere
the
prohibition
remains
intact
for
the
parts
that
are
regarded
as
the
most
precious
that
is
to
say
as
the
most
sacred
for
example
the
eggs
or
the
fat
in
still
other
parts
consumption
is
not
allowed
except
when
the
animal
in
question
has
not
yet
reached
full
maturity
in
this
case
they
undoubtedly
think
that
its
sacred
character
is
not
yet
complete
so
the
barrier
which
isolates
and
protects
the
totemic
being
yields
but
slowly
and
with
active
resistance
which
bears
witness
to
what
it
must
have
been
at
first
it
is
true
that
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
these
restrictions
are
not
the
remnants
of
what
was
once
a
rigorous
prohibition
now
losing
hold
but
the
beginnings
of
an
interdiction
which
is
only
commencing
to
establish
itself
these
writers
hold
that
at
first
there
was
a
complete
liberty
of
consumption
and
that
the
limitations
which
were
presently
brought
are
relatively
recent
they
think
they
find
the
proof
of
their
theory
in
the
two
following
facts
in
the
first
place
as
we
just
said
there
are
solemn
occasions
when
the
members
of
the
clan
or
their
chief
not
only
may
but
must
eat
the
totemic
animal
or
plant
moreover
the
myths
relate
that
the
great
ancestors
the
founders
of
the
clans
ate
their
totems
regularly
now
it
is
said
these
stories
can
not
be
understood
except
as
an
echo
of
a
time
when
the
present
prohibitions
did
not
exist
but
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
certain
solemn
ceremonies
a
consumption
of
the
totem
and
a
moderate
one
at
that
is
ritually
required
in
no
way
implies
that
it
was
once
an
ordinary
article
of
food
quite
on
the
contrary
the
food
that
one
eats
at
a
mystical
repast
is
essentially
sacred
and
consequently
forbidden
to
the
profane
as
for
the
myths
a
somewhat
summary
critical
method
is
employed
if
they
are
so
readily
given
the
value
of
historical
documents
in
general
their
object
is
to
interpret
existing
rites
rather
than
to
commemorate
past
events
they
are
an
explanation
of
the
present
much
more
than
a
history
in
this
case
the
traditions
according
to
which
the
ancestors
of
the
fabulous
epoch
ate
their
totem
are
in
perfect
accord
with
the
beliefs
and
rites
which
are
always
in
force
the
old
men
and
those
who
have
attained
a
high
religious
dignity
are
freed
from
the
restrictions
under
which
ordinary
men
are
placed
they
can
eat
the
sacred
thing
because
they
are
sacred
themselves
this
rule
is
in
no
way
peculiar
to
totemism
but
it
is
found
in
all
the
most
diverse
religions
now
the
ancestral
heroes
were
nearly
gods
it
is
therefore
still
more
natural
that
they
should
eat
the
sacred
food
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
same
privilege
should
be
awarded
to
the
simple
profane
however
it
is
neither
certain
nor
even
probable
that
the
prohibition
was
ever
absolute
it
seems
to
have
always
been
suspended
in
case
of
necessity
as
for
example
when
a
man
is
famished
and
has
nothing
else
with
which
to
nourish
himself
a
stronger
reason
for
this
is
found
when
the
totem
is
a
form
of
nourishment
which
a
man
can
not
do
without
thus
there
are
a
great
many
tribes
where
water
is
a
totem
a
strict
prohibition
is
manifestly
impossible
in
this
case
however
even
here
the
privilege
granted
is
submitted
to
certain
restrictions
which
greatly
limit
its
use
and
which
show
clearly
that
it
goes
against
a
recognized
principle
among
the
kaitish
and
the
warramunga
a
man
of
this
totem
is
not
allowed
to
drink
water
freely
he
may
not
take
it
up
himself
he
may
receive
it
only
from
the
hands
of
a
third
party
who
must
belong
to
the
phratry
of
which
he
is
not
a
member
the
complexity
of
this
procedure
and
the
embarrassment
which
results
from
it
are
still
another
proof
that
access
to
the
sacred
thing
is
not
free
this
same
rule
is
applied
in
certain
central
tribes
every
time
that
the
totem
is
eaten
whether
from
necessity
or
any
other
cause
it
should
also
be
added
that
when
this
formality
is
not
possible
that
is
when
a
man
is
alone
or
with
members
of
his
own
phratry
only
he
may
on
necessity
do
without
an
intermediary
it
is
clear
that
the
prohibition
is
susceptible
of
various
moderations
nevertheless
it
rests
upon
ideas
so
strongly
ingrained
in
the
mind
that
it
frequently
survives
its
original
cause
for
being
we
have
seen
that
in
all
probability
the
different
clans
of
a
phratry
are
only
subdivisions
of
one
original
clan
which
has
been
dismembered
so
there
was
a
time
when
all
the
clans
being
welded
together
had
the
same
totem
consequently
wherever
the
souvenir
of
this
common
origin
is
not
completely
effaced
each
clan
continues
to
feel
itself
united
to
the
others
and
to
consider
that
their
totems
are
not
completely
foreign
to
it
for
this
reason
an
individual
may
not
eat
freely
of
the
totems
held
by
the
different
clans
of
the
phratry
of
which
he
is
a
member
he
may
touch
them
only
if
the
forbidden
plant
or
animal
is
given
him
by
a
member
of
the
other
phratry
another
survival
of
the
same
sort
is
the
one
concerning
the
maternal
totem
there
are
strong
reasons
for
believing
that
at
first
the
totem
was
transmitted
in
the
uterine
line
therefore
wherever
descent
in
the
paternal
line
has
been
introduced
this
probably
took
place
only
after
a
long
period
during
which
the
opposite
principle
was
applied
and
the
child
had
the
totem
of
his
mother
along
with
all
the
restrictions
attached
to
it
now
in
certain
tribes
where
the
child
inherits
the
paternal
totem
some
of
the
interdictions
which
originally
protected
the
totem
of
his
mother
still
survive
he
can
not
eat
it
freely
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
however
there
is
no
longer
anything
corresponding
to
this
prohibition
to
this
prohibition
of
eating
is
frequently
added
that
of
killing
the
totem
or
picking
it
when
it
is
a
plant
however
here
also
there
are
exceptions
and
tolerations
these
are
especially
in
the
case
of
necessity
when
the
totem
is
a
dangerous
animal
for
example
or
when
the
man
has
nothing
to
eat
there
are
even
tribes
where
men
are
forbidden
to
hunt
the
animals
whose
names
they
bear
on
their
own
accounts
but
where
they
may
kill
them
for
others
but
the
way
in
which
this
act
is
generally
accomplished
clearly
indicates
that
it
is
something
illicit
one
excuses
himself
as
though
for
a
fault
and
bears
witness
to
the
chagrin
which
he
suffers
and
the
repugnance
which
he
feels
while
precautions
are
taken
that
the
animal
may
suffer
as
little
as
possible
in
addition
to
these
fundamental
interdictions
certain
cases
of
a
prohibition
of
contact
between
a
man
and
his
totem
are
cited
thus
among
the
omaha
in
the
clan
of
the
elk
no
one
may
touch
any
part
of
the
body
of
a
male
elk
in
the
of
the
buffalo
no
one
is
allowed
to
touch
the
head
of
this
animal
among
the
bechuana
no
man
dares
to
clothe
himself
in
the
skin
of
his
totem
but
these
cases
are
rare
and
it
is
natural
that
they
should
be
exceptional
for
normally
a
man
must
wear
the
image
of
his
totem
or
something
which
brings
it
to
mind
the
tattooings
and
the
totemic
costumes
would
not
be
possible
if
all
contact
were
forbidden
it
has
also
been
remarked
that
this
prohibition
has
not
been
found
in
australia
but
only
in
those
societies
where
totemism
has
advanced
far
from
its
original
form
it
is
therefore
probably
of
late
origin
and
due
perhaps
to
the
influence
of
ideas
that
are
really
not
totemic
at
all
if
we
now
compare
these
various
interdictions
with
those
whose
object
is
the
totemic
emblem
contrarily
to
all
that
could
be
foreseen
it
appears
that
these
latter
are
more
numerous
stricter
and
more
severely
enforced
than
the
former
the
figures
of
all
sorts
which
represent
the
totem
are
surrounded
with
a
respect
sensibly
superior
to
that
inspired
by
the
very
being
whose
form
these
figures
reproduce
the
churinga
the
nurtunja
and
the
waninga
can
never
be
handled
by
the
women
or
the
uninitiated
who
are
even
allowed
to
catch
glimpses
of
it
only
very
exceptionally
and
from
a
respectful
distance
on
the
other
hand
the
plant
or
animal
whose
name
the
clan
bears
may
be
seen
and
touched
by
everybody
the
churinga
are
preserved
in
a
sort
of
temple
upon
whose
threshold
all
noises
from
the
profane
life
must
cease
it
is
the
domain
of
sacred
things
on
the
contrary
the
totemic
animals
and
plants
live
in
the
profane
world
and
are
mixed
up
with
the
common
everyday
life
since
the
number
and
importance
of
the
interdictions
which
isolate
a
sacred
thing
and
keep
it
apart
correspond
to
the
degree
of
sacredness
with
which
it
is
invested
we
arrive
at
the
remarkable
conclusion
that
images
of
totemic
beings
are
more
sacred
than
the
beings
also
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
cult
it
is
the
churinga
and
the
nurtunja
which
have
the
most
important
place
the
animal
appears
there
only
very
exceptionally
in
a
certain
rite
of
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
it
serves
as
the
substance
for
a
religious
repast
but
it
plays
no
active
rôle
the
arunta
dance
around
the
nurtunja
and
assemble
before
the
image
of
their
totem
to
adore
it
but
a
similar
demonstration
is
never
made
before
the
totemic
being
itself
if
this
latter
were
the
primarily
sacred
object
it
would
be
with
it
the
sacred
animal
or
plant
that
the
young
initiate
would
communicate
when
he
is
introduced
into
the
religious
life
but
we
have
seen
that
on
the
contrary
the
most
solemn
moment
of
the
initiation
is
the
one
when
the
novice
enters
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
churinga
it
is
with
them
and
the
nurtunja
that
he
communicates
the
representations
of
the
totem
are
therefore
more
actively
powerful
than
the
totem
itself
ii
we
must
now
determine
the
place
of
man
in
the
scheme
of
religious
things
by
the
force
of
a
whole
group
of
acquired
habits
and
of
language
itself
we
are
inclined
to
consider
the
common
man
the
simple
believer
as
an
essentially
profane
being
it
may
well
happen
that
this
conception
is
not
literally
true
for
any
religion
in
any
case
it
is
not
applicable
to
totemism
every
member
of
the
clan
is
invested
with
a
sacred
character
which
is
not
materially
inferior
to
that
which
we
just
observed
in
the
animal
this
personal
sacredness
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
man
believes
that
while
he
is
a
man
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
he
is
also
an
animal
or
plant
of
the
totemic
species
in
fact
he
bears
its
name
this
identity
of
name
is
therefore
supposed
to
imply
an
identity
of
nature
the
first
is
not
merely
considered
as
an
outward
sign
of
the
second
it
supposes
it
logically
this
is
because
the
name
for
a
primitive
is
not
merely
a
word
or
a
combination
of
sounds
it
is
a
part
of
the
being
and
even
something
essential
to
it
a
member
of
the
kangaroo
clan
calls
himself
a
kangaroo
he
is
therefore
in
one
sense
an
animal
of
this
species
the
totem
of
any
man
say
spencer
and
gillen
is
regarded
as
the
same
thing
as
himself
a
native
once
said
to
us
when
we
were
discussing
the
matter
with
him
one
pointing
to
his
photograph
which
we
had
taken
the
same
thing
as
me
so
is
a
kangaroo
his
totem
so
each
individual
has
a
double
nature
two
beings
coexist
within
him
a
man
and
an
animal
in
order
to
give
a
semblance
of
intelligibility
to
this
duality
so
strange
for
us
the
primitive
has
invented
myths
which
it
is
true
explain
nothing
and
only
shift
the
difficulty
but
which
by
shifting
it
seem
at
least
to
lessen
the
logical
scandal
with
slight
variations
of
detail
all
are
constructed
on
the
same
plan
their
object
is
to
establish
genealogical
connections
between
the
man
and
the
totemic
animal
making
the
one
a
relative
of
the
other
by
this
common
origin
which
by
the
way
is
represented
in
various
manners
they
believe
that
they
account
for
their
common
nature
the
narrinyeri
for
example
have
imagined
that
certain
of
the
first
men
had
the
power
of
transforming
themselves
into
beasts
other
australian
societies
place
at
the
beginning
of
humanity
either
strange
animals
from
which
the
men
were
descended
in
some
unknown
way
or
mixed
beings
between
the
two
kingdoms
or
else
unformed
creatures
hardly
representable
deprived
of
all
determined
organs
and
even
of
all
definite
members
and
the
different
parts
of
whose
bodies
were
hardly
outlined
mythical
powers
sometimes
conceived
under
the
form
of
animals
then
intervened
and
made
men
out
of
these
ambiguous
and
innumerable
beings
which
spencer
and
gillen
say
represent
stages
in
the
transformation
of
animals
and
plants
into
human
beings
these
transformations
are
represented
to
us
under
the
form
of
violent
and
as
it
were
surgical
operations
it
is
under
the
blows
of
an
axe
or
if
the
operator
is
a
bird
blows
of
the
beak
that
the
human
individual
was
carved
out
of
this
shapeless
mass
his
members
separated
from
each
other
his
mouth
opened
and
his
nostrils
pierced
analogous
legends
are
found
in
america
except
that
owing
to
the
more
highly
developed
mentality
of
these
peoples
the
representations
which
they
employ
do
not
contain
confusions
so
troublesome
for
the
mind
sometimes
it
is
a
legendary
personage
who
by
an
act
of
his
power
metamorphosed
the
animal
who
gives
its
name
to
the
clan
into
a
man
sometimes
the
myth
attempts
to
explain
how
by
a
series
of
nearly
natural
events
and
a
sort
of
spontaneous
evolution
the
animal
transformed
himself
little
by
little
and
finally
took
a
human
form
it
is
true
that
there
are
societies
the
haida
tlinkit
tsimshian
where
it
is
no
longer
admitted
that
man
was
born
of
an
animal
or
plant
but
the
idea
of
an
affinity
between
the
animals
of
the
totemic
species
and
the
members
of
the
clan
has
survived
there
nevertheless
and
expresses
itself
in
myths
which
though
differing
from
the
preceding
still
retain
all
that
is
essential
in
them
here
is
one
of
the
fundamental
themes
the
ancestor
who
gives
his
name
to
the
clan
is
here
represented
as
a
human
being
but
who
in
the
course
of
various
wanderings
has
been
led
to
live
for
a
while
among
the
fabulous
animals
of
the
very
species
which
gave
the
clan
its
name
as
the
result
of
this
intimate
and
prolonged
connection
he
became
so
like
his
new
companions
that
when
he
returned
to
men
they
no
longer
recognized
him
he
was
therefore
given
the
name
of
the
animal
which
he
resembled
it
is
from
his
stay
in
this
mythical
land
that
he
brought
back
the
totemic
emblem
together
with
the
powers
and
virtues
believed
to
be
attached
to
it
thus
in
this
case
as
in
the
others
men
are
believed
to
participate
in
the
nature
of
the
animal
though
this
participation
may
be
conceived
in
slightly
different
forms
so
man
also
has
something
sacred
about
him
though
diffused
into
the
whole
organism
this
characteristic
is
especially
apparent
in
certain
privileged
places
there
are
organs
and
tissues
that
are
specially
marked
out
these
are
particularly
the
blood
and
the
hair
in
the
first
place
human
blood
is
so
holy
a
thing
that
in
the
tribes
of
central
australia
it
frequently
serves
to
consecrate
the
most
respected
instruments
of
the
cult
for
example
in
certain
cases
the
nurtunja
is
regularly
anointed
from
top
to
bottom
with
the
blood
of
a
man
it
is
upon
ground
all
saturated
with
blood
that
the
men
of
the
emu
among
the
arunta
trace
their
sacred
images
we
shall
presently
see
that
streams
of
blood
are
poured
upon
the
rocks
which
represent
the
totemic
animals
and
plants
there
is
no
religious
ceremony
where
blood
does
not
have
some
part
to
play
during
the
initiation
the
adults
open
their
veins
and
sprinkle
the
novice
with
their
blood
and
this
blood
is
so
sacred
a
thing
that
women
may
not
be
present
while
it
is
flowing
the
sight
of
it
is
forbidden
them
just
as
the
sight
of
a
churinga
is
the
blood
lost
by
a
young
initiate
during
the
very
violent
operations
he
must
undergo
has
very
particular
virtues
it
is
used
in
various
ceremonies
that
which
flows
during
the
is
piously
kept
by
the
arunta
and
buried
in
a
place
upon
which
they
put
a
piece
of
wood
warning
of
the
sacredness
of
the
spot
no
woman
should
approach
it
the
religious
nature
of
blood
also
explains
the
equal
importance
religiously
of
the
red
ochre
which
is
very
frequently
employed
in
ceremonies
they
rub
the
churinga
with
it
and
use
it
in
ritual
decorations
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
because
of
its
colour
it
is
regarded
as
something
kindred
to
blood
many
deposits
of
red
ochre
which
are
found
in
the
arunta
territory
are
even
supposed
to
be
the
coagulated
blood
which
certain
heroines
of
the
mythical
period
shed
on
to
the
soil
hair
has
similar
properties
the
natives
of
the
centre
wear
belts
made
of
human
hair
whose
religious
functions
we
have
already
pointed
out
they
are
also
used
to
wrap
up
certain
instruments
of
the
cult
does
one
man
loan
another
one
of
his
churinga
as
a
sign
of
acknowledgment
the
second
makes
a
present
of
hair
to
the
first
these
two
sorts
of
things
are
therefore
thought
to
be
of
the
same
order
and
of
equivalent
value
so
the
operation
of
cutting
the
hair
is
a
ritual
act
accompanied
by
definite
ceremonies
the
individual
operated
upon
must
squat
on
the
ground
with
his
face
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
place
where
the
fabulous
ancestors
from
which
the
clan
of
his
mother
is
believed
to
be
descended
are
thought
to
have
camped
for
the
same
reason
as
soon
as
a
man
is
dead
they
cut
his
hair
off
and
put
it
away
in
some
distant
place
for
neither
women
nor
the
have
the
right
of
seeing
it
it
is
here
far
from
profane
eyes
that
the
belts
are
made
other
organic
tissues
might
be
mentioned
which
have
similar
properties
in
varying
degrees
such
are
the
whiskers
the
foreskin
the
fat
of
the
liver
etc
but
it
is
useless
to
multiply
examples
those
already
given
are
enough
to
prove
that
there
is
something
in
man
which
holds
profane
things
at
a
distance
and
which
possesses
a
religious
power
in
other
words
the
human
organism
conceals
within
its
depths
a
sacred
principle
which
visibly
comes
to
the
surface
in
certain
determined
cases
this
principle
does
not
differ
materially
from
that
which
causes
the
religious
character
of
the
totem
in
fact
we
have
just
seen
that
the
different
substances
in
which
it
incarnates
itself
especially
enter
into
the
ritual
composition
of
the
objects
of
the
cult
nurtunja
totemic
designs
or
else
are
used
in
the
anointings
whose
object
is
to
renew
the
virtues
either
of
the
churinga
or
of
the
sacred
rocks
they
are
things
of
the
same
species
sometimes
the
religious
dignity
which
is
inherent
in
each
member
of
the
clan
on
this
account
is
not
equal
for
all
men
possess
it
to
a
higher
degree
than
women
in
relation
to
them
women
are
like
profane
beings
thus
every
time
that
there
is
an
assembly
either
of
the
totemic
group
or
of
the
tribe
the
men
have
a
separate
camp
distinct
from
that
of
the
women
and
into
which
these
latter
may
not
enter
they
are
separated
off
but
there
are
also
differences
in
the
way
in
which
men
are
marked
with
a
religious
character
the
young
men
not
yet
initiated
are
wholly
deprived
of
it
since
they
are
not
admitted
to
the
ceremonies
it
is
among
the
old
men
that
it
reaches
its
greatest
intensity
they
are
so
very
sacred
that
certain
things
forbidden
to
ordinary
people
are
permissible
for
them
they
may
eat
the
totemic
animal
more
freely
and
as
we
have
seen
there
are
even
some
tribes
where
they
are
freed
from
all
dietetic
restrictions
so
we
must
be
careful
not
to
consider
totemism
a
sort
of
animal
worship
the
attitude
of
a
man
towards
the
animals
or
plants
whose
name
he
bears
is
not
at
all
that
of
a
believer
towards
his
god
for
he
belongs
to
the
sacred
world
himself
their
relations
are
rather
those
of
two
beings
who
are
on
the
same
level
and
of
equal
value
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
in
certain
cases
at
least
the
animal
seems
to
occupy
a
slightly
more
elevated
place
in
the
hierarchy
of
sacred
things
it
is
because
of
this
that
it
is
sometimes
called
the
father
or
the
grandfather
of
the
men
of
the
clan
which
seems
to
show
that
they
feel
themselves
in
a
state
of
moral
dependence
in
regard
to
it
but
in
other
and
perhaps
even
more
frequent
cases
it
happens
that
the
expressions
used
denote
rather
a
sentiment
of
equality
the
totemic
animal
is
called
the
friend
or
the
elder
brother
of
its
human
fellows
finally
the
bonds
which
exist
between
them
and
it
are
much
more
like
those
which
unite
the
members
of
a
single
family
the
animals
and
the
men
are
made
of
the
same
flesh
as
the
buandik
say
on
account
of
this
kinship
men
regard
the
animals
of
the
totemic
species
as
kindly
associates
upon
whose
aid
they
think
they
can
rely
they
call
them
to
their
aid
and
they
come
to
direct
their
blows
in
the
hunt
and
to
give
warning
of
whatever
dangers
there
may
be
in
return
for
this
men
treat
them
with
regard
and
are
never
cruel
to
them
but
these
attentions
in
no
way
resemble
a
cult
men
sometimes
even
appear
to
have
a
mysterious
sort
of
over
their
totems
the
prohibition
against
killing
and
eating
them
is
applied
only
to
members
of
the
clan
of
course
it
could
not
be
extended
to
other
persons
without
making
life
practically
impossible
if
in
a
tribe
like
the
arunta
where
there
is
such
a
host
of
different
totems
it
were
forbidden
to
eat
not
only
the
animal
or
plant
whose
name
one
bears
but
also
all
the
animals
and
all
the
plants
which
serve
as
totems
to
other
clans
the
sources
of
food
would
be
reduced
to
nothing
yet
there
are
tribes
where
the
consumption
of
the
totemic
plant
or
animal
is
not
allowed
without
restrictions
even
to
foreigners
among
the
wakelbura
it
must
not
take
place
in
the
presence
of
men
of
this
totem
in
other
places
their
permission
must
be
given
for
example
among
the
kaitish
and
the
unmatjera
whenever
a
man
of
the
emu
totem
happens
to
be
in
a
place
occupied
by
a
clan
and
gathers
some
of
these
seed
before
eating
them
he
must
go
to
the
chief
and
say
to
him
i
have
gathered
these
seeds
in
your
country
to
this
the
chief
replies
all
right
you
may
eat
them
but
if
the
emu
man
ate
them
before
demanding
permission
it
is
believed
that
he
would
fall
sick
and
run
the
risk
of
dying
there
are
even
cases
where
the
chief
of
the
group
must
take
a
little
of
the
food
and
eat
it
himself
it
is
a
sort
of
payment
which
must
be
made
for
the
same
reason
the
churinga
gives
the
hunter
a
certain
power
over
the
corresponding
animal
by
rubbing
his
body
with
a
euro
churinga
for
example
a
man
acquires
a
greater
chance
of
catching
euros
this
is
the
proof
that
the
fact
of
participating
in
the
nature
of
a
totemic
being
confers
a
sort
of
eminent
right
over
this
latter
finally
there
is
one
tribe
in
northern
queensland
the
karingbool
where
the
men
of
the
totem
are
the
only
ones
who
have
a
right
to
kill
the
animal
or
if
the
totem
is
a
tree
to
peel
off
its
bark
their
aid
is
indispensable
to
all
others
who
want
to
use
the
flesh
of
this
animal
or
the
wood
of
this
tree
for
their
own
personal
ends
so
they
appear
as
proprietors
though
it
is
quite
evidently
over
a
special
sort
of
property
of
which
we
find
it
hard
to
form
an
idea
chapter
iii
totemic
beliefs
cosmological
system
of
totemism
and
the
idea
of
we
are
beginning
to
see
that
totemism
is
a
much
more
complex
religion
than
it
first
appeared
to
be
we
have
already
distinguished
three
classes
of
things
which
it
recognizes
as
sacred
in
varying
degrees
the
totemic
emblem
the
animal
or
plant
whose
appearance
this
emblem
reproduces
and
the
members
of
the
clan
however
this
list
is
not
yet
complete
in
fact
a
religion
is
not
merely
a
collection
of
fragmentary
beliefs
in
regard
to
special
objects
like
those
we
have
just
been
discussing
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
all
known
religions
have
been
systems
of
ideas
which
tend
to
embrace
the
universality
of
things
and
to
give
us
a
complete
representation
of
the
world
if
totemism
is
to
be
considered
as
a
religion
comparable
to
the
others
it
too
should
offer
us
a
conception
of
the
universe
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
does
satisfy
this
condition
i
the
fact
that
this
aspect
of
totemism
has
generally
been
neglected
is
due
to
the
too
narrow
notion
of
the
clan
which
has
been
prevalent
ordinarily
it
is
regarded
as
a
mere
group
of
human
beings
being
a
simple
subdivision
of
the
tribe
it
seems
that
like
this
it
is
made
up
of
nothing
but
men
but
in
reasoning
thus
we
substitute
our
european
ideas
for
those
which
the
primitive
has
of
man
and
of
society
for
the
australian
things
themselves
everything
which
is
in
the
universe
are
a
part
of
the
tribe
they
are
constituent
elements
of
it
and
so
to
speak
regular
members
of
it
just
like
men
they
have
a
determined
place
in
the
general
scheme
of
organization
of
the
society
the
south
australian
savage
says
fison
looks
upon
the
universe
as
the
great
tribe
to
one
of
whose
divisions
he
himself
belongs
and
all
things
animate
and
inanimate
which
belong
to
his
class
are
parts
of
the
body
corporate
whereof
he
himself
is
a
part
as
a
consequence
of
this
principle
whenever
the
tribe
is
divided
into
two
phratries
all
known
things
are
distributed
between
them
all
nature
says
palmer
in
speaking
of
the
bellinger
river
tribe
is
also
divided
into
class
phratry
names
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
are
said
to
belong
to
classes
phratries
just
as
the
blacks
themselves
the
port
mackay
tribe
in
queensland
has
two
phratries
with
the
names
yungaroo
and
wootaroo
as
do
the
neighbouring
tribes
now
as
bridgmann
says
all
things
animate
and
inanimate
are
divided
by
these
tribes
into
two
classes
named
yungaroo
and
wootaroo
nor
does
the
classification
stop
here
the
men
of
each
phratry
are
distributed
among
a
certain
number
of
clans
likewise
the
things
attributed
to
each
phratry
are
in
their
turn
distributed
among
the
clans
of
which
the
phratry
is
composed
a
certain
tree
for
example
will
be
assigned
to
the
kangaroo
clan
and
to
it
alone
then
just
like
the
human
members
of
the
clan
it
will
have
the
kangaroo
as
totem
another
will
belong
to
the
snake
clan
clouds
will
be
placed
under
one
totem
the
sun
under
another
etc
all
known
things
will
thus
be
arranged
in
a
sort
of
tableau
or
systematic
classification
embracing
the
whole
of
nature
we
have
given
a
certain
number
of
these
classifications
elsewhere
at
present
we
shall
confine
ourselves
to
repeating
a
few
of
these
as
examples
one
of
the
best
known
of
these
is
the
one
found
in
the
mount
gambier
tribe
this
tribe
includes
two
phratries
named
respectively
the
kumite
and
the
kroki
each
of
these
in
its
turn
is
subdivided
into
five
clans
now
everything
in
nature
belongs
to
one
or
another
of
these
ten
clans
fison
and
howitt
say
that
they
are
all
included
within
it
in
fact
they
are
classified
under
these
ten
totems
just
like
species
in
their
respective
classes
this
is
well
shown
by
the
following
table
based
on
information
gathered
by
curr
and
by
fison

for

the
list
of
things
attached
to
each
clan
is
quite
incomplete
curr
himself
warns
us
that
he
has
limited
himself
to
enumerating
some
of
them
but
through
the
work
of
mathews
and
of
howitt
we
have
more
extended
information
on
the
classification
adopted
by
the
wotjobaluk
tribe
which
enables
us
to
understand
better
how
a
system
of
this
kind
is
able
to
include
the
whole
universe
as
known
to
the
natives
the
wotjobaluk
also
are
divided
into
two
phratries
called
gurogity
and
gumaty
krokitch
and
gamutch
according
to
howitt
not
to
prolong
this
enumeration
we
shall
content
ourselves
with
indicating
after
mathews
the
things
classed
in
some
of
the
clans
of
the
gurogity
phratry
in
the
clan
of
the
yam
are
classified
the
the
native
cat
the
the
owl
the
hen
the
rosella
parrot
the
peewee
in
the
mussel
clan
are
the
grey
emu
the
porcupine
the
curlew
the
white
cockatoo
the
the
lizard
the
stinking
turtle
the
flying
squirrel
the
opossum
the
pigeon
the
in
the
sun
clan
are
the
bandicoot
the
moon
the
the
black
and
white
magpies
the
opossum
the
u
hawk
the
grub
the
grub
the
planet
venus
in
the
clan
of
the
warm
wind
are
the
the
carpet
snake
the
smoker
parrot
the
shell
parrot
the
hawk
the
snake
the
parrot
the
snake
the
lizard
if
we
remember
that
there
are
many
other
clans
howitt
names
twelve
and
mathews
fourteen
and
adds
that
his
list
is
incomplete
we
will
understand
how
all
the
things
in
which
the
native
takes
an
interest
find
a
natural
place
in
these
classifications
similar
arrangements
have
been
observed
in
the
most
diverse
parts
of
the
australian
continent
in
south
australia
in
victoria
and
in
new
south
wales
among
the
euahlayi
very
clear
traces
of
it
are
found
in
the
central
tribes
in
queensland
where
the
clans
seem
to
have
disappeared
and
where
the
matrimonial
classes
are
the
only
subdivisions
of
the
phratry
things
are
divided
up
among
these
classes
thus
the
wakelbura
are
divided
into
two
phratries
mallera
and
wutaru
the
classes
of
the
first
are
called
kurgilla
and
banbe
those
of
the
second
wungo
and
obu
now
to
the
banbe
belong
the
opossum
the
kangaroo
the
dog
honey
of
little
bees
etc
to
the
wungo
are
attributed
the
emu
the
bandicoot
the
black
duck
the
black
snake
the
brown
snake
to
the
obu
the
carpet
snake
the
honey
of
stinging
bees
etc
to
the
kurgilla
the
porcupine
the
turkey
of
the
plains
water
rain
fire
thunder
etc
this
same
organization
is
found
among
the
indians
of
north
america
the
zuñi
have
a
system
of
classification
which
in
its
essential
lines
is
in
all
points
comparable
to
the
one
we
have
just
described
that
of
the
omaha
rests
on
the
same
principles
as
that
of
the
wotjobaluk
an
echo
of
these
same
ideas
survives
even
into
the
more
advanced
societies
among
the
haida
all
the
gods
and
mythical
beings
who
are
placed
in
charge
of
the
different
phenomena
of
nature
are
classified
in
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
phratries
which
make
up
the
tribe
just
like
men
some
are
eagles
the
others
crows
now
the
gods
of
things
are
only
another
aspect
of
the
things
which
they
govern
this
mythological
classification
is
therefore
merely
another
form
of
the
preceding
one
so
we
may
rest
assured
that
this
way
of
conceiving
the
world
is
independent
of
all
ethnic
or
geographic
particularities
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
clearly
seen
to
be
closely
united
to
the
whole
system
of
totemic
beliefs
ii
in
the
paper
to
which
we
have
already
made
allusion
several
times
we
have
shown
what
light
these
facts
throw
upon
the
way
in
which
the
idea
of
kind
or
class
was
formed
in
humanity
in
fact
these
systematic
classifications
are
the
first
we
meet
with
in
history
and
we
have
just
seen
that
they
are
modelled
upon
the
social
organization
or
rather
that
they
have
taken
the
forms
of
society
as
their
framework
it
is
the
phratries
which
have
served
as
classes
and
the
clans
as
species
it
is
because
men
were
organized
that
they
have
been
able
to
organize
things
for
in
classifying
these
latter
they
limited
themselves
to
giving
them
places
in
the
groups
they
formed
themselves
and
if
these
different
classes
of
things
are
not
merely
put
next
to
each
other
but
are
arranged
according
to
a
unified
plan
it
is
because
the
social
groups
with
which
they
commingle
themselves
are
unified
and
through
their
union
form
an
organic
whole
the
tribe
the
unity
of
these
first
logical
systems
merely
reproduces
the
unity
of
the
society
thus
we
have
an
occasion
for
verifying
the
proposition
which
we
laid
down
at
the
commencement
of
this
work
and
for
assuring
ourselves
that
the
fundamental
notions
of
the
intellect
the
essential
categories
of
thought
may
be
the
product
of
social
factors
the
facts
show
clearly
that
this
is
the
case
with
the
very
notion
of
category
itself
however
it
is
not
our
intention
to
deny
that
the
individual
intellect
has
of
itself
the
power
of
perceiving
resemblances
between
the
different
objects
of
which
it
is
conscious
quite
on
the
contrary
it
is
clear
that
even
the
most
primitive
and
simple
classifications
presuppose
this
faculty
the
australian
does
not
place
things
in
the
same
clan
or
in
different
clans
at
random
for
him
as
for
us
similar
images
attract
one
another
while
opposed
ones
repel
one
another
and
it
is
on
the
basis
of
these
feelings
of
affinity
or
of
repulsion
that
he
classifies
the
corresponding
things
in
one
place
or
another
there
are
also
cases
where
we
are
able
to
perceive
the
reasons
which
inspired
this
the
two
phratries
were
very
probably
the
original
and
fundamental
bases
for
these
classifications
which
were
consequently
bifurcate
at
first
now
when
a
classification
is
reduced
to
two
classes
these
are
almost
necessarily
conceived
as
antitheses
they
are
used
primarily
as
a
means
of
clearly
separating
things
between
which
there
is
a
very
marked
contrast
some
are
set
at
the
right
the
others
at
the
left
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
the
character
of
the
australian
classifications
if
the
white
cockatoo
is
in
one
phratry
the
black
one
is
in
the
other
if
the
sun
is
on
one
side
the
moon
and
the
stars
of
night
are
on
the
opposite
side
very
frequently
the
beings
which
serve
as
the
totems
of
the
two
phratries
have
contrary
colours
these
oppositions
are
even
met
with
outside
of
australia
where
one
of
the
phratries
is
disposed
to
peace
the
other
is
disposed
to
war
if
one
has
water
as
its
totem
the
other
has
earth
this
is
undoubtedly
the
explanation
of
why
the
two
phratries
have
frequently
been
thought
of
as
naturally
antagonistic
to
one
another
they
say
that
there
is
a
sort
of
rivalry
or
even
a
constitutional
hostility
between
them
this
opposition
of
things
has
extended
itself
to
persons
the
logical
contrast
has
begotten
a
sort
of
social
conflict
it
is
also
to
be
observed
that
within
each
phratry
those
things
have
been
placed
in
a
single
clan
which
seem
to
have
the
greatest
affinity
with
that
serving
as
totem
for
example
the
moon
has
been
placed
with
the
black
cockatoo
but
the
sun
together
with
the
atmosphere
and
the
wind
with
the
white
cockatoo
or
again
to
a
totemic
animal
has
been
united
all
that
serves
him
as
food
as
well
as
the
animals
with
which
he
has
the
closest
connection
of
course
we
can
not
always
understand
the
obscure
psychology
which
has
caused
many
of
these
connections
and
distinctions
but
the
preceding
examples
are
enough
to
show
that
a
certain
intuition
of
the
resemblances
and
differences
presented
by
things
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
genesis
of
these
classifications
but
the
feeling
of
resemblances
is
one
thing
and
the
idea
of
class
is
another
the
class
is
the
external
framework
of
which
objects
perceived
to
be
similar
form
in
part
the
contents
now
the
contents
can
not
furnish
the
frame
into
which
they
fit
they
are
made
up
of
and
images
due
to
the
and
partial
fusion
of
a
number
of
individual
which
are
found
to
have
common
elements
the
framework
on
the
contrary
is
a
with
fixed
outlines
but
which
may
be
applied
to
an
number
of
perceived
or
not
actual
or
possible
in
fact
every
class
has
possibilities
of
extension
which
go
far
beyond
the
circle
of
objects
which
we
know
either
from
direct
experience
or
from
resemblance
this
is
why
every
school
of
thinkers
has
refused
and
not
with
good
reason
to
identify
the
idea
of
class
with
that
of
a
generic
image
the
generic
image
is
only
the
residual
representation
left
in
us
by
similar
representations
when
they
are
present
in
consciousness
simultaneously
the
class
is
a
logical
symbol
by
means
of
which
we
think
distinctly
of
these
similarities
and
of
other
analogous
ones
moreover
the
best
proof
of
the
distance
separating
these
two
notions
is
that
an
animal
is
able
to
form
generic
images
though
ignorant
of
the
art
of
thinking
in
classes
and
species
the
idea
of
class
is
an
instrument
of
thought
which
has
obviously
been
constructed
by
men
but
in
constructing
it
we
have
at
least
had
need
of
a
model
for
how
could
this
idea
ever
have
been
born
if
there
had
been
nothing
either
in
us
or
around
us
which
was
capable
of
suggesting
it
to
us
to
reply
that
it
was
given
to
us
is
not
to
reply
at
all
this
lazy
man
solution
is
as
has
been
said
the
death
of
analysis
but
it
is
hard
to
see
where
we
could
have
found
this
indispensable
model
except
in
the
spectacle
of
the
collective
life
in
fact
a
class
is
not
an
ideal
but
a
clearly
defined
group
of
things
between
which
internal
relationships
exist
similar
to
those
of
kindred
now
the
only
groups
of
this
sort
known
from
experience
are
those
formed
by
men
in
associating
themselves
material
things
may
be
able
to
form
collections
of
units
or
heaps
or
mechanical
assemblages
with
no
internal
unity
but
not
groups
in
the
sense
we
have
given
the
word
a
heap
of
sand
or
a
pile
of
rock
is
in
no
way
comparable
to
that
variety
of
definite
and
organized
society
which
forms
a
class
in
all
probability
we
would
never
have
thought
of
uniting
the
beings
of
the
universe
into
homogeneous
groups
called
classes
if
we
had
not
had
the
example
of
human
societies
before
our
eyes
if
we
had
not
even
commenced
by
making
things
themselves
members
of
men
society
and
also
if
human
groups
and
logical
groups
had
not
been
confused
at
first
it
is
also
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
a
classification
is
a
system
whose
parts
are
arranged
according
to
a
hierarchy
there
are
dominating
members
and
others
which
are
subordinate
to
the
first
species
and
their
distinctive
properties
depend
upon
classes
and
the
attributes
which
characterize
them
again
the
different
species
of
a
single
class
are
conceived
as
all
placed
on
the
same
level
in
regard
to
each
other
does
someone
prefer
to
regard
them
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
understanding
then
he
represents
things
to
himself
in
an
inverse
order
he
puts
at
the
top
the
species
that
are
the
most
particularized
and
the
richest
in
reality
while
the
types
that
are
most
general
and
the
poorest
in
qualities
are
at
the
bottom
nevertheless
all
are
represented
in
a
hierarchic
form
and
we
must
be
careful
not
to
believe
that
the
expression
has
only
a
metaphorical
sense
here
there
are
really
relations
of
subordination
and
the
establishment
of
which
is
the
object
of
all
classification
and
men
would
never
have
thought
of
arranging
their
knowledge
in
this
way
if
they
had
not
known
beforehand
what
a
hierarchy
was
but
neither
the
spectacle
of
physical
nature
nor
the
mechanism
of
mental
associations
could
furnish
them
with
this
knowledge
the
hierarchy
is
exclusively
a
social
affair
it
is
only
in
society
that
there
are
superiors
inferiors
and
equals
consequently
even
if
the
facts
were
not
enough
to
prove
it
the
mere
analysis
of
these
ideas
would
reveal
their
origin
we
have
taken
them
from
society
and
projected
them
into
our
conceptions
of
the
world
it
is
society
that
has
furnished
the
outlines
which
logical
thought
has
filled
in
iii
but
these
primitive
classifications
have
a
no
less
direct
interest
for
the
origins
of
religious
thought
they
imply
that
all
the
things
thus
classed
in
a
single
clan
or
a
single
phratry
are
closely
related
both
to
each
other
and
to
the
thing
serving
as
the
totem
of
this
clan
or
phratry
when
an
australian
of
the
port
mackay
tribe
says
that
the
sun
snakes
are
of
the
yungaroo
phratry
he
does
not
mean
merely
to
apply
a
common
but
none
the
less
a
purely
conventional
nomenclature
to
these
different
things
the
word
has
an
objective
signification
for
him
he
believes
that
alligators
really
yungaroo
and
that
kangaroos
are
wootaroo
the
sun
yungaroo
the
moon
wootaroo
and
so
on
for
the
constellations
trees
plants
etc
an
internal
bond
attaches
them
to
the
group
in
which
they
are
placed
they
are
regular
members
of
it
it
is
said
that
they
belong
to
the
group
just
exactly
as
the
individual
men
make
a
part
of
it
consequently
the
same
sort
of
a
relation
unites
them
to
these
latter
men
regard
the
things
in
their
clan
as
their
relatives
or
associates
they
call
them
their
friends
and
think
that
they
are
made
out
of
the
same
flesh
as
themselves
therefore
between
the
two
there
are
elective
affinities
and
quite
special
relations
of
agreement
things
and
people
have
a
common
name
and
in
a
certain
way
they
naturally
understand
each
other
and
harmonize
with
one
another
for
example
when
a
wakelbura
of
the
mallera
phratry
is
buried
the
scaffold
upon
which
the
body
is
exposed
must
be
made
of
the
wood
of
some
tree
belonging
to
the
mallera
phratry
the
same
is
true
for
the
branches
that
cover
the
corpse
if
the
deceased
is
of
the
banbe
class
a
banbe
tree
must
be
used
in
this
same
tribe
a
magician
can
use
in
his
art
only
those
things
which
belong
to
his
own
phratry
since
the
others
are
strangers
to
him
he
does
not
know
how
to
make
them
obey
him
thus
a
bond
of
mystic
sympathy
unites
each
individual
to
those
beings
whether
living
or
not
which
are
associated
with
him
the
result
of
this
is
a
belief
in
the
possibility
of
deducing
what
he
will
do
or
what
he
has
done
from
what
they
are
doing
among
these
same
wakelbura
when
a
man
dreams
that
he
has
killed
an
animal
belonging
to
a
certain
social
division
he
expects
to
meet
a
man
of
this
same
division
the
next
day
inversely
the
things
attributed
to
a
clan
or
phratry
can
not
be
used
against
the
members
of
this
clan
or
phratry
among
the
wotjobaluk
each
phratry
has
its
own
special
trees
now
in
hunting
an
animal
of
the
gurogity
phratry
only
arms
whose
wood
is
taken
from
trees
of
the
other
phratry
may
be
used
and
otherwise
the
hunter
is
sure
to
miss
his
aim
the
native
is
convinced
that
the
arrow
would
turn
of
itself
and
refuse
so
to
speak
to
hit
a
kindred
and
friendly
animal
thus
the
men
of
the
clan
and
the
things
which
are
classified
in
it
form
by
their
union
a
solid
system
all
of
whose
parts
are
united
and
vibrate
sympathetically
this
organization
which
at
first
may
have
appeared
to
us
as
purely
logical
is
at
the
same
time
moral
a
single
principle
animates
it
and
makes
its
unity
this
is
the
totem
just
as
a
man
who
belongs
to
the
crow
clan
has
within
him
something
of
this
animal
so
the
rain
since
it
is
of
the
same
clan
and
belongs
to
the
same
totem
is
also
necessarily
considered
as
being
the
same
thing
as
a
crow
for
the
same
reason
the
moon
is
a
black
cockatoo
the
sun
a
white
cockatoo
every
tree
a
pelican
etc
all
the
beings
arranged
in
a
single
clan
whether
men
animals
plants
or
inanimate
objects
are
merely
forms
of
the
totemic
being
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
formula
which
we
have
just
cited
and
this
is
what
makes
the
two
really
of
the
same
species
all
are
really
of
the
same
flesh
in
the
sense
that
all
partake
of
the
nature
of
the
totemic
animal
also
the
qualifiers
given
them
are
those
given
to
the
totem
the
wotjobaluk
give
the
name
both
to
the
totem
and
to
the
things
classed
with
it
it
is
true
that
among
the
arunta
where
visible
traces
of
classification
still
exist
as
we
shall
see
different
words
designate
the
totem
and
the
other
beings
placed
with
it
however
the
name
given
to
these
latter
bears
witness
to
the
close
relations
which
unite
them
to
the
totemic
animal
it
is
said
that
they
are
its
its
its
it
is
believed
that
they
are
inseparable
from
it
so
there
is
a
feeling
that
these
are
very
closely
related
things
but
we
also
know
that
the
totemic
animal
is
a
sacred
being
all
the
things
that
are
classified
in
the
clan
of
which
it
is
the
emblem
have
this
same
character
because
in
one
sense
they
are
animals
of
the
same
species
just
as
the
man
is
they
too
are
sacred
and
the
classifications
which
locate
them
in
relation
to
the
other
things
of
the
universe
by
that
very
act
give
them
a
place
in
the
religious
world
for
this
reason
the
animals
or
plants
among
these
may
not
be
eaten
freely
by
the
human
members
of
the
clan
thus
in
the
mount
gambier
tribe
the
men
whose
totem
is
a
certain
snake
must
not
merely
refrain
from
eating
the
flesh
of
this
snake
that
of
seals
eels
is
also
forbidden
to
them
if
driven
by
necessity
they
do
eat
some
of
it
they
must
at
least
attenuate
the
sacrilege
by
expiatory
rites
just
as
if
they
had
eaten
the
totem
itself
among
the
euahlayi
where
it
is
permitted
to
use
the
totem
but
not
to
abuse
it
the
same
rule
is
applied
to
the
other
members
of
the
clan
among
the
arunta
the
interdictions
protecting
the
totemic
animal
extend
over
the
associated
animals
and
in
any
case
particular
attention
must
be
given
to
these
latter
the
sentiments
inspired
by
the
two
are
identical
but
the
fact
that
the
things
thus
attached
to
the
totem
are
not
of
a
different
nature
from
it
and
consequently
have
a
religious
character
is
best
proved
by
the
fact
that
on
certain
occasions
they
fulfil
the
same
functions
they
are
accessory
or
secondary
totems
or
according
to
an
expression
now
consecrated
by
usage
they
are
it
is
constantly
happening
in
the
clans
that
under
the
influence
of
various
sympathies
particular
affinities
are
forming
smaller
groups
and
more
limited
associations
arise
which
tend
to
lead
a
relatively
autonomous
life
and
to
form
a
new
subdivision
like
a
within
the
larger
one
in
order
to
distinguish
and
individualize
itself
this
needs
a
special
totem
or
consequently
a
now
the
totems
of
these
secondary
groups
are
chosen
from
among
the
things
classified
under
the
principal
totem
so
they
are
always
almost
totems
and
the
slightest
circumstance
is
enough
to
make
them
actually
so
there
is
a
latent
totemic
nature
in
them
which
shows
itself
as
soon
as
conditions
permit
it
or
demand
it
it
thus
happens
that
a
single
individual
has
two
totems
a
principal
totem
common
to
the
whole
clan
and
a
which
is
special
to
the
of
which
he
is
a
member
this
is
something
analogous
to
the
and
of
the
romans
sometimes
we
see
a
emancipate
itself
completely
and
become
an
autonomous
group
and
an
independent
clan
then
the
on
its
side
becomes
a
regular
totem
one
tribe
where
this
process
of
segmentation
has
been
pushed
to
the
limit
so
to
speak
is
the
arunta
the
information
contained
in
the
first
book
of
spencer
and
gillen
showed
that
there
were
some
sixty
totems
among
the
arunta
but
the
recent
researches
of
strehlow
have
shown
the
number
to
be
much
larger
he
counted
no
less
than
spencer
and
gillen
did
not
exaggerate
at
all
when
they
said
in
fact
there
is
scarcely
an
object
animate
or
inanimate
to
be
found
in
the
country
occupied
by
the
natives
which
does
not
give
its
name
to
some
totemic
group
now
this
multitude
of
totems
whose
number
is
prodigious
when
compared
to
the
population
is
due
to
the
fact
that
under
special
circumstances
the
original
clans
have
divided
and
infinitely
consequently
nearly
all
the
have
passed
to
the
stage
of
totems
this
has
been
definitely
proved
by
the
observations
of
strehlow
spencer
and
gillen
cited
only
certain
isolated
cases
of
associated
totems
strehlow
has
shown
that
this
is
in
reality
an
absolutely
general
organization
he
has
been
able
to
draw
up
a
table
where
nearly
all
the
totems
of
the
arunta
are
classified
according
to
this
principle
all
are
attached
either
as
associates
or
as
auxiliaries
to
some
sixty
principal
totems
the
first
are
believed
to
be
in
the
service
of
the
second
this
state
of
dependence
is
very
probably
the
echo
of
a
time
when
the
allies
of
were
only
and
consequently
when
the
tribe
contained
only
a
small
number
of
clans
subdivided
into
numerous
survivals
confirm
this
hypothesis
it
frequently
happens
that
two
groups
thus
associated
have
the
same
totemic
emblem
now
this
unity
of
emblem
is
explicable
only
if
the
two
groups
were
at
first
only
one
the
relation
of
the
two
clans
is
also
shown
by
the
part
and
the
interest
that
each
one
takes
in
the
rites
of
the
other
the
two
cults
are
still
only
imperfectly
separated
this
is
very
probably
because
they
were
at
first
completely
intermingled
tradition
explains
the
bonds
which
unite
them
by
imagining
that
formerly
the
two
clans
occupied
neighbouring
places
in
other
cases
the
myth
says
expressly
that
one
of
them
was
derived
from
the
other
it
is
related
that
at
first
the
associated
animal
belonged
to
the
species
still
serving
as
principal
totem
it
differentiated
itself
at
a
later
period
thus
the
chantunga
birds
which
are
associated
with
the
witchetly
grub
were
witchetly
grubs
in
fabulous
times
who
later
transformed
themselves
into
birds
two
species
which
are
now
attached
to
the
were
formerly
etc
this
transformation
of
a
into
a
totem
goes
on
by
imperceptible
degrees
so
that
in
certain
cases
the
situation
is
undecided
and
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
one
is
dealing
with
a
principal
totem
or
a
secondary
one
as
howitt
says
in
regard
to
the
wotjobaluk
there
are
which
are
totems
in
formation
thus
the
different
things
classified
in
a
clan
constitute
as
it
were
so
many
nuclei
around
which
new
totemic
cults
are
able
to
form
this
is
the
best
proof
of
the
religious
sentiments
which
they
inspire
if
they
did
not
have
a
sacred
character
they
could
not
be
promoted
so
easily
to
the
same
dignity
as
the
things
which
are
sacred
before
all
others
the
regular
totems
so
the
field
of
religious
things
extends
well
beyond
the
limits
within
which
it
seemed
to
be
confined
at
first
it
embraces
not
only
the
totemic
animals
and
the
human
members
of
the
clan
but
since
no
known
thing
exists
that
is
not
classified
in
a
clan
and
under
a
totem
there
is
likewise
nothing
which
does
not
receive
to
some
degree
something
of
a
religious
character
when
in
the
religions
which
later
come
into
being
the
gods
properly
appear
each
of
them
will
be
set
over
a
special
category
of
natural
phenomena
this
one
over
the
sea
that
one
over
the
air
another
over
the
harvest
or
over
fruits
and
each
of
these
provinces
of
nature
will
be
believed
to
draw
what
life
there
is
in
it
from
the
god
upon
whom
it
depends
this
division
of
nature
among
the
different
divinities
constitutes
the
conception
which
these
religions
give
us
of
the
universe
now
so
long
as
humanity
has
not
passed
the
phase
of
totemism
the
different
totems
of
the
tribe
fulfil
exactly
the
same
functions
that
will
later
fall
upon
the
divine
personalities
in
the
mount
gambier
tribe
which
we
have
taken
as
our
principal
example
there
are
ten
clans
consequently
the
entire
world
is
divided
into
ten
classes
or
rather
into
ten
families
each
of
which
has
a
special
totem
as
its
basis
it
is
from
this
basis
that
the
things
classed
in
the
clan
get
all
their
reality
for
they
are
thought
of
as
variant
forms
of
the
totemic
being
to
return
to
our
example
the
rain
thunder
lightning
clouds
hail
and
winter
are
regarded
as
different
sorts
of
crows
when
brought
together
these
ten
families
of
things
make
up
a
complete
and
systematic
representation
of
the
world
and
this
representation
is
religious
for
religious
notions
furnish
its
basis
far
from
being
limited
to
one
or
two
categories
of
beings
the
domain
of
totemic
religion
extends
to
the
final
limits
of
the
known
universe
just
like
the
greek
religion
it
puts
the
divine
everywhere
the
celebrated
formula
greek
panta
plêrê
theôn
everything
is
full
of
the
gods
might
equally
well
serve
it
as
motto
however
if
totemism
is
to
be
represented
thus
the
notion
of
it
which
has
long
been
held
must
be
modified
on
one
essential
point
until
the
discoveries
of
recent
years
it
was
made
to
consist
entirely
in
the
cult
of
one
particular
totem
and
it
was
defined
as
the
religion
of
the
clan
from
this
point
of
view
each
tribe
seemed
to
have
as
many
totemic
religions
each
independent
of
the
others
as
it
had
different
clans
this
conception
was
also
in
harmony
with
the
idea
currently
held
of
the
clan
in
fact
this
was
regarded
as
an
autonomous
society
more
or
less
closed
to
other
similar
societies
or
having
only
external
and
superficial
relations
with
these
latter
but
the
reality
is
more
complex
undoubtedly
the
cult
of
each
totem
has
its
home
in
the
corresponding
clan
it
is
there
and
only
there
that
it
is
celebrated
it
is
members
of
the
clan
who
have
charge
of
it
it
is
through
them
that
it
is
transmitted
from
one
generation
to
another
along
with
the
beliefs
which
are
its
basis
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
different
totemic
cults
thus
practised
within
a
single
tribe
do
not
have
a
parallel
development
though
remaining
ignorant
of
each
other
as
if
each
of
them
constituted
a
complete
and
religion
on
the
contrary
they
mutually
imply
each
other
they
are
only
the
parts
of
a
single
whole
the
elements
of
a
single
religion
the
men
of
one
clan
never
regard
the
beliefs
of
neighbouring
clans
with
that
indifference
scepticism
or
hostility
which
one
religion
ordinarily
inspires
for
another
which
is
foreign
to
it
they
partake
of
these
beliefs
themselves
the
crow
people
are
also
convinced
that
the
snake
people
have
a
mythical
serpent
as
ancestor
and
that
they
owe
special
virtues
and
marvellous
powers
to
this
origin
and
have
we
not
seen
that
at
least
in
certain
conditions
a
man
may
eat
a
totem
that
is
not
his
own
only
after
he
has
observed
certain
ritual
formalities
especially
he
must
demand
the
permission
of
the
men
of
this
totem
if
any
are
present
so
for
him
also
this
food
is
not
entirely
profane
he
also
admits
that
there
are
intimate
affinities
between
the
members
of
a
clan
of
which
he
is
not
a
member
and
the
animal
whose
name
they
bear
also
this
community
of
belief
is
sometimes
shown
in
the
cult
if
in
theory
the
rites
concerning
a
totem
can
be
performed
only
by
the
men
of
this
totem
nevertheless
representatives
of
different
clans
frequently
assist
at
them
it
sometimes
happens
that
their
part
is
not
simply
that
of
spectators
it
is
true
that
they
do
not
officiate
but
they
decorate
the
officiants
and
prepare
the
service
they
themselves
have
an
interest
in
its
being
celebrated
therefore
in
certain
tribes
it
is
they
who
invite
the
qualified
clan
to
proceed
with
the
ceremonies
there
is
even
a
whole
cycle
of
rites
which
must
take
place
in
the
presence
of
the
assembled
tribe
these
are
the
totemic
ceremonies
of
initiation
finally
the
totemic
organization
such
as
we
have
just
described
it
must
obviously
be
the
result
of
some
sort
of
an
indistinct
understanding
between
all
the
members
of
the
tribe
it
is
impossible
that
each
clan
should
have
made
its
beliefs
in
an
absolutely
independent
manner
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
cults
of
the
different
totems
should
be
in
some
way
adjusted
to
each
other
since
they
complete
one
another
exactly
in
fact
we
have
seen
that
normally
a
single
totem
is
not
repeated
twice
in
the
same
tribe
and
that
the
whole
universe
is
divided
up
among
the
totems
thus
constituted
in
such
a
way
that
the
same
object
is
not
found
in
two
different
clans
so
methodical
a
division
could
never
have
been
made
without
an
agreement
tacit
or
planned
in
which
the
whole
tribe
participated
so
the
group
of
beliefs
which
thus
arise
are
partially
but
only
partially
a
tribal
affair
to
sum
up
then
in
order
to
form
an
adequate
idea
of
totemism
we
must
not
confine
ourselves
within
the
limits
of
the
clan
but
must
consider
the
tribe
as
a
whole
it
is
true
that
the
particular
cult
of
each
clan
enjoys
a
very
great
autonomy
we
can
now
see
that
it
is
within
the
clan
that
the
active
ferment
of
the
religious
life
takes
place
but
it
is
also
true
that
these
cults
fit
into
each
other
and
the
totemic
religion
is
a
complex
system
formed
by
their
union
just
as
greek
polytheism
was
made
by
the
union
of
all
the
particular
cults
addressed
to
the
different
divinities
we
have
just
shown
that
thus
understood
totemism
also
has
it
cosmology
chapter
iv
totemic
beliefs
individual
totem
and
the
sexual
up
to
the
present
we
have
studied
totemism
only
as
a
public
institution
the
only
totems
of
which
we
have
spoken
are
common
to
a
clan
a
phratry
or
in
a
sense
to
a
tribe
an
individual
has
a
part
in
them
only
as
a
member
of
a
group
but
we
know
that
there
is
no
religion
which
does
not
have
an
individual
aspect
this
general
observation
is
applicable
to
totemism
in
addition
to
the
impersonal
and
collective
totems
which
hold
the
first
place
there
are
others
which
are
peculiar
to
each
individual
which
express
his
personality
and
whose
cult
he
celebrates
in
private
i
in
certain
australian
tribes
and
in
the
majority
of
the
indian
tribes
of
north
america
each
individual
personally
sustains
relations
with
some
determined
object
which
are
comparable
to
those
which
each
clan
sustains
with
its
totem
this
is
sometimes
an
inanimate
being
or
an
artificial
object
but
it
is
generally
an
animal
in
certain
cases
a
special
part
of
the
organism
such
as
the
head
the
feet
or
the
liver
fulfils
this
office
the
name
of
the
thing
also
serves
as
the
name
of
the
individual
it
is
his
personal
name
his
forename
which
is
added
to
that
of
the
collective
totem
as
the
of
the
romans
was
to
the
it
is
true
that
this
fact
is
not
reported
except
in
a
certain
number
of
societies
but
it
is
probably
general
in
fact
we
shall
presently
show
that
there
is
an
identity
of
nature
between
the
individual
and
the
thing
now
an
identity
of
nature
implies
one
of
name
being
given
in
the
course
of
especially
important
religious
ceremonies
this
forename
has
a
sacred
character
it
is
not
pronounced
in
the
ordinary
circumstances
of
profane
life
it
even
happens
that
the
word
designating
this
object
in
the
ordinary
language
must
be
modified
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
if
it
is
to
serve
in
this
particular
case
this
is
because
the
terms
of
the
usual
language
are
excluded
from
the
religious
life
in
certain
american
tribes
at
least
this
name
is
reinforced
by
an
emblem
belonging
to
each
individual
and
representing
under
various
forms
the
thing
designated
by
the
name
for
example
each
mandan
wears
the
skin
of
the
animal
of
which
he
is
the
namesake
if
it
is
a
bird
he
decorates
himself
with
its
feathers
the
hurons
and
algonquins
tattoo
their
bodies
with
its
image
it
is
represented
on
their
arms
among
the
tribes
the
individual
emblem
just
like
the
collective
emblem
of
the
clan
is
carved
or
engraved
on
the
utensils
houses
etc
it
serves
as
a
mark
of
ownership
frequently
the
two
are
combined
together
which
partially
explains
the
great
diversity
of
aspects
presented
by
the
totemic
escutcheons
among
these
peoples
between
the
individual
and
his
animal
namesake
there
exist
the
very
closest
bonds
the
man
participates
in
the
nature
of
the
animal
he
has
its
good
qualities
as
well
as
its
faults
for
example
a
man
having
the
eagle
as
his
is
believed
to
possess
the
gift
of
seeing
into
the
future
if
he
is
named
after
a
bear
they
say
that
he
is
apt
to
be
wounded
in
combat
for
the
bear
is
heavy
and
slow
and
easily
caught
if
the
animal
is
despised
the
man
is
the
object
of
the
same
sentiment
the
relationship
of
the
two
is
even
so
close
that
it
is
believed
that
in
certain
circumstances
especially
in
case
of
danger
the
man
can
take
the
form
of
the
animal
inversely
the
animal
is
regarded
as
a
double
of
the
man
as
his
the
association
of
the
two
is
so
close
that
their
destinies
are
frequently
thought
to
be
bound
up
together
nothing
can
happen
to
one
without
the
other
feeling
a
reaction
if
the
animal
dies
the
life
of
the
man
is
menaced
thus
it
comes
to
be
a
very
general
rule
that
one
should
not
kill
the
animal
nor
eat
its
flesh
this
interdiction
which
when
concerning
the
totem
of
the
clan
allows
of
all
sorts
of
attenuations
and
modifications
is
now
much
more
formal
and
absolute
on
its
side
the
animal
protects
the
man
and
serves
him
as
a
sort
of
patron
it
informs
him
of
possible
dangers
and
of
the
way
of
escaping
them
they
say
that
it
is
his
friend
since
it
frequently
happens
to
possess
marvellous
powers
it
communicates
them
to
its
human
associate
who
believes
in
them
even
under
the
proof
of
bullets
arrows
and
blows
of
every
sort
this
confidence
of
an
individual
in
the
efficacy
of
his
protector
is
so
great
that
he
braves
the
greatest
dangers
and
accomplishes
the
most
disconcerting
feats
with
an
intrepid
serenity
faith
gives
him
the
necessary
courage
and
strength
however
the
relations
of
a
man
with
his
patron
are
not
purely
and
simply
those
of
dependence
he
on
his
side
is
able
to
act
upon
the
animal
he
gives
it
orders
he
has
influence
over
it
a
kurnai
having
the
shark
as
ally
and
friend
believes
that
he
can
disperse
the
sharks
who
menace
a
boat
by
means
of
a
charm
in
other
cases
the
relations
thus
contracted
are
believed
to
confer
upon
the
man
a
special
aptitude
for
hunting
the
animal
with
success
the
very
nature
of
these
relations
seems
clearly
to
imply
that
the
being
to
which
each
individual
is
thus
associated
is
only
an
individual
itself
and
not
a
species
a
man
does
not
have
a
species
as
his
in
fact
there
are
cases
where
it
is
certainly
a
certain
determined
tree
rock
or
stone
that
fulfils
this
function
it
must
be
thus
every
time
that
it
is
an
animal
and
that
the
existences
of
the
animal
and
the
man
are
believed
to
be
connected
a
man
could
not
be
united
so
closely
to
a
whole
species
for
there
is
not
a
day
nor
so
to
speak
an
instant
when
the
species
does
not
lose
some
one
of
its
members
yet
the
primitive
has
a
certain
incapacity
for
thinking
of
the
individual
apart
from
the
species
the
bonds
uniting
him
to
the
one
readily
extend
to
the
other
he
confounds
the
two
in
the
same
sentiment
thus
the
entire
species
becomes
sacred
for
him
this
protector
is
naturally
given
different
names
in
different
societies
among
the
indians
of
mexico
among
the
algonquins
and
among
the
hurons
among
certain
salish
among
others
among
the
yuin
among
the
euahlayi
etc
owing
to
the
importance
of
these
beliefs
and
practices
among
the
indians
of
north
america
some
have
proposed
creating
a
word
or
to
designate
them
but
in
giving
them
a
special
and
distinctive
name
we
run
the
risk
of
misunderstanding
their
relations
with
the
rest
of
totemism
in
fact
the
same
principle
is
applied
in
the
one
case
to
the
clan
and
in
the
other
to
the
individual
in
both
cases
we
find
the
same
belief
that
there
are
vital
connections
between
the
things
and
the
men
and
that
the
former
are
endowed
with
special
powers
of
which
their
human
allies
may
also
enjoy
the
advantage
we
also
find
the
same
custom
of
giving
the
man
the
name
of
the
thing
with
which
he
is
associated
and
of
adding
an
emblem
to
this
name
the
totem
is
the
patron
of
the
clan
just
as
the
patron
of
the
individual
is
his
personal
totem
so
it
is
important
that
our
terminology
should
make
the
relationship
of
the
two
systems
apparent
that
is
why
we
with
frazer
shall
give
the
name
to
the
cult
rendered
by
each
individual
to
his
patron
a
further
justification
of
this
expression
is
found
in
the
fact
that
in
certain
cases
the
primitive
himself
uses
the
same
word
to
designate
the
totem
of
the
clan
and
the
animal
protector
of
the
individual
if
tylor
and
powell
have
rejected
this
term
and
demanded
different
ones
for
these
two
sorts
of
religious
institutions
it
is
because
the
collective
totem
is
in
their
opinion
only
a
name
or
label
having
no
religious
character
but
we
on
the
contrary
know
that
it
is
a
sacred
thing
and
even
more
so
than
the
protecting
animal
moreover
the
continuation
of
our
study
will
show
how
these
two
varieties
of
totemism
are
inseparable
from
each
other
yet
howsoever
close
the
kinship
between
these
two
institutions
may
be
there
are
important
differences
between
them
while
the
clan
believes
that
it
is
the
offspring
of
the
animal
or
plant
serving
it
as
totem
the
individual
does
not
believe
that
he
has
any
relationship
of
descent
with
his
personal
totem
it
is
a
friend
an
associate
a
protector
but
it
is
not
a
relative
he
takes
advantage
of
the
virtues
it
is
believed
to
possess
but
he
is
not
of
the
same
blood
in
the
second
place
the
members
of
a
clan
allow
neighbouring
clans
to
eat
of
the
animal
whose
name
they
bear
collectively
under
the
simple
condition
that
the
necessary
formalities
shall
be
observed
but
on
the
contrary
the
individual
respects
the
species
to
which
his
personal
totem
belongs
and
also
protects
it
against
strangers
at
least
in
those
parts
where
the
destiny
of
the
man
is
held
to
be
bound
up
with
that
of
the
animal
but
the
chief
difference
between
these
two
sorts
of
totems
is
in
the
manner
in
which
they
are
acquired
the
collective
totem
is
a
part
of
the
civil
status
of
each
individual
it
is
generally
hereditary
in
any
case
it
is
birth
which
designates
it
and
the
wish
of
men
counts
for
nothing
sometimes
the
child
has
the
totem
of
his
mother
kamilaroi
dieri
urabunna
etc
sometimes
that
of
his
father
narrinyeri
warramunga
etc
sometimes
the
one
predominating
in
the
locality
where
his
mother
conceived
arunta
loritja
but
on
the
contrary
the
individual
totem
is
acquired
by
a
deliberate
act
a
whole
series
of
ritual
operations
are
necessary
to
determine
it
the
method
generally
employed
by
the
indians
of
north
america
is
as
follows
about
the
time
of
puberty
as
the
time
for
initiation
approaches
the
young
man
withdraws
into
a
distant
place
for
example
into
a
forest
there
during
a
period
varying
from
a
few
days
to
several
years
he
submits
himself
to
all
sorts
of
exhausting
and
unnatural
exercises
he
fasts
mortifies
himself
and
inflicts
various
mutilations
upon
himself
now
he
wanders
about
uttering
violent
cries
and
veritable
howls
now
he
lies
extended
motionless
and
lamenting
upon
the
ground
sometimes
he
dances
prays
and
invokes
his
ordinary
divinities
at
last
he
thus
gets
himself
into
an
extreme
state
of
verging
on
delirium
when
he
has
reached
this
paroxysm
his
representations
readily
take
on
the
character
of
hallucinations
when
says
heckewelder
a
boy
is
on
the
eve
of
being
initiated
he
is
submitted
to
an
alternating
régime
of
fasts
and
medical
treatment
he
abstains
from
all
food
and
takes
the
most
powerful
and
repugnant
drugs
at
times
he
drinks
intoxicating
concoctions
until
his
mind
really
wanders
then
he
has
or
thinks
he
has
visions
and
extraordinary
dreams
to
which
he
was
of
course
predisposed
by
all
this
training
he
imagines
himself
flying
through
the
air
advancing
under
the
ground
jumping
from
one
to
another
across
the
valleys
and
fighting
and
conquering
giants
and
monsters
if
in
these
circumstances
he
sees
or
as
amounts
to
the
same
thing
he
thinks
he
sees
while
dreaming
or
while
awake
an
animal
appearing
to
him
in
an
attitude
seeming
to
show
friendly
intentions
then
he
imagines
that
he
has
discovered
the
patron
he
awaited
yet
this
procedure
is
rarely
employed
in
australia
on
this
continent
the
personal
totem
seems
to
be
imposed
by
a
third
party
either
at
birth
or
at
the
moment
of
initiation
generally
it
is
a
relative
who
takes
this
part
or
else
a
personage
invested
with
special
powers
such
as
an
old
man
or
a
magician
sometimes
divination
is
used
for
this
purpose
for
example
on
charlotte
bay
cape
bedford
or
the
proserpine
river
the
grandmother
or
some
other
old
woman
takes
a
little
piece
of
umbilical
cord
to
which
the
placenta
is
still
attached
and
whirls
it
about
quite
violently
meanwhile
the
other
old
women
propose
different
names
that
one
is
adopted
which
happens
to
be
pronounced
just
at
the
moment
when
the
cord
breaks
among
the
of
cape
york
after
a
tooth
has
been
knocked
out
of
the
young
initiate
they
give
him
a
little
water
to
rinse
his
mouth
and
ask
him
to
spit
in
a
bucket
full
of
water
the
old
men
carefully
examine
the
clot
formed
by
the
blood
and
saliva
thus
spit
out
and
the
natural
object
whose
shape
it
resembles
becomes
the
personal
totem
of
the
young
man
in
other
cases
the
totem
is
transmitted
from
one
individual
to
another
for
example
from
father
to
son
or
uncle
to
nephew
this
method
is
also
used
in
america
in
a
case
reported
by
hill
tout
the
operator
was
a
shaman
who
wished
to
transmit
his
totem
to
his
nephew
the
uncle
took
the
symbol
of
his
his
personal
totem
which
in
this
case
was
a
dried
bird
skin
and
bade
his
nephew
breathe
upon
it
he
then
blew
upon
it
also
himself
uttered
some
mystic
words
and
the
dried
skin
seemed
to
paul
the
nephew
to
become
a
living
bird
which
flew
about
them
a
moment
or
two
and
then
finally
disappeared
paul
was
then
instructed
by
his
uncle
to
procure
that
day
a
bird
skin
of
the
same
kind
as
his
uncle
and
wear
it
on
his
person
this
he
did
and
that
night
he
had
a
dream
in
which
the
appeared
to
him
in
the
shape
of
a
human
being
disclosed
to
him
its
mystic
name
by
which
it
might
be
summoned
and
promised
him
protection
not
only
is
the
individual
totem
acquired
and
not
given
but
ordinarily
the
acquisition
of
one
is
not
obligatory
in
the
first
place
there
are
a
multitude
of
tribes
in
australia
where
the
custom
seems
to
be
absolutely
unknown
also
even
where
it
does
exist
it
is
frequently
optional
thus
among
the
euahlayi
while
all
the
magicians
have
individual
totems
from
which
they
get
their
powers
there
are
a
great
number
of
laymen
who
have
none
at
all
it
is
a
favour
given
by
the
magician
but
which
he
reserves
for
his
friends
his
favourites
and
those
who
aspire
to
becoming
his
colleagues
likewise
among
certain
salish
persons
desiring
to
excel
especially
either
in
fighting
or
in
hunting
or
aspirants
to
the
position
of
shaman
are
the
only
ones
who
provide
themselves
with
protectors
of
this
sort
so
among
certain
peoples
at
least
the
individual
totem
seems
to
be
considered
an
advantage
and
convenient
thing
rather
than
a
necessity
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
but
a
man
can
do
without
one
inversely
a
man
need
not
limit
himself
to
a
single
totem
if
he
wishes
to
be
more
fully
protected
nothing
hinders
his
seeking
and
acquiring
several
and
if
the
one
he
has
fulfils
its
part
badly
he
can
change
it
but
while
it
is
more
optional
and
free
individual
totemism
contains
within
it
a
force
of
resistance
never
attained
by
the
totemism
of
the
clan
one
of
the
chief
informers
of
hill
tout
was
a
baptized
salish
however
though
he
had
sincerely
abandoned
the
faith
of
his
fathers
and
though
he
had
become
a
model
catechist
still
his
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
the
personal
totems
remained
unshaken
similarly
though
no
visible
traces
of
collective
totemism
remain
in
civilized
countries
the
idea
that
there
is
a
connection
between
each
individual
and
some
animal
plant
or
other
object
is
at
the
bottom
of
many
customs
still
observable
in
many
european
countries
ii
between
collective
totemism
and
individual
totemism
there
is
an
intermediate
form
partaking
of
the
characteristics
of
each
this
is
sexual
totemism
it
is
found
only
in
australia
and
in
a
small
number
of
tribes
it
is
mentioned
especially
in
victoria
and
new
south
wales
mathews
it
is
true
claims
to
have
observed
it
in
all
the
parts
of
australia
that
he
has
visited
but
he
gives
no
precise
facts
to
support
this
affirmation
among
these
different
peoples
all
the
men
of
the
tribe
on
the
one
hand
and
all
the
women
on
the
other
to
whatever
special
clan
they
may
belong
form
as
it
were
two
distinct
and
even
antagonistic
societies
now
each
of
these
two
sexual
corporations
believes
that
it
is
united
by
mystical
bonds
to
a
determined
animal
among
the
kurnai
all
the
men
think

the

is
substituted
for
the
each
sex
regards
the
animal
to
which
it
is
thus
related
as
a
sort
of
protector
which
must
be
treated
with
the
greatest
regard
it
is
also
forbidden
to
kill
and
eat
it
thus
this
protecting
animal
plays
the
same
part
in
relation
to
the
sexual
society
that
the
totem
of
the
clan
plays
to
this
latter
group
so
the
expression
sexual
totemism
which
we
borrow
from
frazer
is
justified
this
new
sort
of
totem
resembles
that
of
the
clan
particularly
in
that
it
too
is
collective
it
belongs
to
all
the
people
of
one
sex
indiscriminately
it
also
resembles
this
form
in
that
it
implies
a
relationship
of
descent
and
consanguinity
between
the
animal
patron
and
the
corresponding
sex
among
the
kurnai

the
first
observer
to
point
out
this
curious
institution
described
it
in
in
the
following
terms
tilmun
a
little
bird
the
size
of
a
thrush
it
is
a
sort
of
woodpecker
is
supposed
by
the
women
to
be
the
first
maker
of
women
these
birds
are
held
in
veneration
by
the
women
only
so
it
was
a
great
ancestor
but
in
other
ways
this
same
totem
resembles
the
individual
totem
in
fact
it
is
believed
that
each
member
of
a
sexual
group
is
personally
united
to
a
determined
individual
of
the
corresponding
animal
species
the
two
lives
are
so
closely
associated
that
the
death
of
the
animal
brings
about
that
of
the
man
the
life
of
a
bat
say
the
wotjobaluk
is
the
life
of
a
man
that
is
why
each
sex
not
only
respects
its
own
totem
but
forces
the
members
of
the
other
to
do
so
as
well
every
violation
of
this
interdiction
gives
rise
to
actual
bloody
battles
between
the
men
and
the
women
finally
the
really
original
feature
of
these
totems
is
that
they
are
in
a
sense
a
sort
of
tribal
totems
in
fact
they
result
from
representing
the
tribe
as
descended
as
a
whole
from
one
couple
of
mythical
beings
such
a
belief
seems
to
demonstrate
clearly
that
the
tribal
sentiment
has
acquired
sufficient
force
to
resist
at
least
to
a
considerable
extent
the
particularism
of
the
clans
in
regard
to
the
distinct
origins
assigned
to
men
and
to
women
it
must
be
said
that
its
cause
is
to
be
sought
in
the
separate
conditions
in
which
the
men
and
the
women
live
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
the
sexual
totems
are
related
to
the
totems
of
the
clans
according
to
the
theory
of
the
australians
what
relations
there
were
between
the
two
ancestors
thus
placed
at
the
commencement
of
the
tribe
and
from
which
one
each
special
clan
is
believed
to
be
descended
but
the
ethnographical
data
at
our
present
disposal
do
not
allow
us
to
resolve
these
questions
moreover
however
natural
and
even
necessary
it
may
appear
to
us
it
is
very
possible
that
the
natives
never
raised
it
they
do
not
feel
the
need
of
and
systematizing
their
beliefs
as
strongly
as
we
do
chapter
v
origins
of
these
beliefs
examination
of
preceding
the
beliefs
which
we
have
just
summarized
are
manifestly
of
a
religious
nature
since
they
imply
a
division
of
things
into
sacred
and
profane
it
is
certain
that
there
is
no
thought
of
spiritual
beings
and
in
the
course
of
our
exposition
we
have
not
even
had
occasion
to
pronounce
the
words
spirits
genii
or
divine
personalities
but
if
certain
writers
of
whom
we
shall
have
something
more
to
say
presently
have
for
this
reason
refused
to
regard
totemism
as
a
religion
it
is
because
they
have
an
inexact
notion
of
what
religious
phenomena
are
on
the
other
hand
we
are
assured
that
this
religion
is
the
most
primitive
one
that
is
now
observable
and
even
in
all
probability
that
has
ever
existed
in
fact
it
is
inseparable
from
a
social
organization
on
a
clan
basis
not
only
is
it
impossible
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
to
define
it
except
in
connection
with
the
clan
but
it
even
seems
as
though
the
clan
could
not
exist
in
the
form
it
has
taken
in
a
great
number
of
australian
societies
without
the
totem
for
the
members
of
a
single
clan
are
not
united
to
each
other
either
by
a
common
habitat
or
by
common
blood
as
they
are
not
necessarily
consanguineous
and
are
frequently
scattered
over
different
parts
of
the
tribal
territory
their
unity
comes
solely
from
their
having
the
same
name
and
the
same
emblem
their
believing
that
they
have
the
same
relations
with
the
same
categories
of
things
their
practising
the
same
rites
or
in
a
word
from
their
participating
in
the
same
totemic
cult
thus
totemism
and
the
clan
mutually
imply
each
other
in
so
far
at
least
as
the
latter
is
not
confounded
with
the
local
group
now
the
social
organization
on
a
clan
basis
is
the
simplest
which
we
know
in
fact
it
exists
in
all
its
essential
elements
from
the
moment
when
the
society
includes
two
primary
clans
consequently
we
may
say
that
there
are
none
more
rudimentary
as
long
as
societies
reduced
to
a
single
clan
have
not
been
discovered
and
we
believe
that
up
to
the
present
no
traces
of
such
have
been
found
a
religion
so
closely
connected
to
a
social
system
surpassing
all
others
in
simplicity
may
well
be
regarded
as
the
most
elementary
religion
we
can
possibly
know
if
we
succeed
in
discovering
the
origins
of
the
beliefs
which
we
have
just
analysed
we
shall
very
probably
discover
at
the
same
time
the
causes
leading
to
the
rise
of
the
religious
sentiment
in
humanity
but
before
treating
this
question
for
ourselves
we
must
examine
the
most
authorized
solutions
of
it
which
have
already
been
proposed
i
in
the
first
place
we
find
a
group
of
scholars
who
believe
that
they
can
account
for
totemism
by
deriving
it
from
some
previous
religion
for
tylor
and
wilken
totemism
is
a
special
form
of
the
cult
of
the
ancestors
it
was
the
widespread
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
that
served
as
a
bridge
between
these
two
religious
systems
a
large
number
of
peoples
believe
that
after
death
the
soul
does
not
remain
disincarnate
for
ever
but
presently
animates
another
living
body
on
the
other
hand
the
lower
psychology
drawing
no
definite
line
of
demarcation
between
the
souls
of
men
and
of
beasts
can
at
least
admit
without
difficulty
the
transmigration
of
human
souls
into
the
bodies
of
the
lower
animals
tylor
cites
a
certain
number
of
cases
under
these
circumstances
the
religious
respect
inspired
by
the
ancestor
is
quite
naturally
attached
to
the
animal
or
plant
with
which
he
is
presently
confounded
the
animal
thus
serving
as
a
receptacle
for
a
venerated
being
becomes
a
holy
thing
the
object
of
a
cult
that
is
a
totem
for
all
the
descendants
of
the
ancestor
who
form
the
clan
descended
from
him
facts
pointed
out
by
wilken
among
the
societies
of
the
malay
archipelago
would
tend
to
prove
that
it
really
was
in
this
manner
that
the
totemic
beliefs
originated
in
java
and
sumatra
crocodiles
are
especially
honoured
they
are
regarded
as
benevolent
protectors
who
must
not
be
killed
offerings
are
made
to
them
now
the
cult
thus
rendered
to
them
is
due
to
their
being
supposed
to
incarnate
the
souls
of
ancestors
the
malays
of
the
philippines
consider
the
crocodile
their
grandfather
the
tiger
is
treated
in
the
same
way
for
the
same
reasons
similar
beliefs
have
been
observed
among
the
bantous
in
melanesia
it
sometimes
happens
that
an
influential
man
at
the
moment
of
death
announces
his
desire
to
reincarnate
himself
in
a
certain
animal
or
plant
it
is
easily
understood
how
the
object
thus
chosen
as
his
posthumous
residence
becomes
sacred
for
his
whole
family
so
far
from
being
a
primitive
fact
totemism
would
seem
to
be
the
product
of
a
more
complex
religion
which
preceded
it
but
the
societies
from
which
these
facts
were
taken
had
already
arrived
at
a
rather
advanced
stage
of
culture
in
any
case
they
had
passed
the
stage
of
pure
totemism
they
have
families
and
not
totemic
clans
even
the
majority
of
the
animals
to
which
religious
honours
are
thus
rendered
are
venerated
not
by
special
groups
of
families
but
by
the
tribes
as
a
whole
so
if
these
beliefs
and
practices
do
have
some
connection
with
ancient
totemic
cults
they
now
represent
only
altered
forms
of
them
and
are
consequently
not
very
well
fitted
for
showing
us
their
origins
it
is
not
by
studying
an
institution
at
the
moment
when
it
is
in
full
decadence
that
we
can
learn
how
it
was
formed
if
we
want
to
know
how
totemism
originated
it
is
neither
in
java
nor
sumatra
nor
melanesia
that
we
must
study
it
but
in
australia
here
we
find
neither
a
cult
of
the
dead
nor
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
of
course
they
believe
that
the
mythical
heroes
the
founders
of
the
clan
reincarnate
themselves
periodically
this
is
in
human
bodies
each
birth
as
we
shall
see
is
the
product
of
one
of
these
reincarnations
so
if
the
animals
of
the
totemic
species
are
the
object
of
rites
it
is
not
because
the
ancestral
souls
are
believed
to
reside
in
them
it
is
true
that
the
first
ancestors
are
frequently
represented
under
the
form
of
an
animal
and
this
very
common
representation
is
an
important
fact
for
which
we
must
account
but
it
was
not
the
belief
in
metempsychosis
which
gave
it
birth
for
this
belief
is
unknown
among
australian
societies
moreover
far
from
being
able
to
explain
totemism
this
belief
takes
for
granted
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
upon
which
this
rests
that
is
to
say
it
begs
the
question
to
be
explained
it
just
as
much
as
totemism
implies
that
man
is
considered
a
close
relative
of
the
animal
for
if
these
two
kingdoms
were
clearly
distinguished
in
the
mind
men
would
never
believe
that
a
human
soul
could
pass
so
easily
from
one
into
the
other
it
is
even
necessary
that
the
body
of
the
animal
be
considered
its
true
home
for
it
is
believed
to
go
there
as
soon
as
it
regains
its
liberty
now
while
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
postulates
this
singular
affinity
it
offers
no
explanation
of
it
the
only
explanation
offered
by
tylor
is
that
men
sometimes
resemble
in
certain
traits
the
anatomy
and
physiology
of
the
animal
the
features
and
actions
and
characters
of
animals
are
watched
with
wondering
sympathy
by
the
savage
as
by
the
child
the
beast
is
the
very
incarnation
of
familiar
qualities
of
man
and
such
names
as
lion
bear
fox
owl
parrot
viper
worm
when
we
apply
them
as
epithets
to
men
condense
into
a
word
some
leading
features
of
a
human
life
but
even
if
these
resemblances
are
met
with
they
are
uncertain
and
exceptional
before
all
else
men
resemble
their
relatives
and
companions
and
not
plants
and
animals
such
rare
and
questionable
analogies
could
not
overcome
such
unanimous
proofs
nor
could
they
lead
a
man
to
think
of
himself
and
his
forefathers
in
forms
contradicted
by
daily
experience
so
this
question
remains
untouched
and
as
long
as
it
is
not
answered
we
can
not
say
that
totemism
is
explained
finally
this
whole
theory
rests
upon
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
for
tylor
as
for
wundt
totemism
is
only
a
particular
case
of
the
cult
of
animals
but
we
on
the
contrary
know
that
it
is
something
very
different
from
a
sort
of
the
animal
is
never
adored
the
man
is
nearly
its
equal
and
sometimes
even
treats
it
as
his
possession
so
far
is
he
from
being
subordinate
to
it
like
a
believer
before
his
god
if
the
animals
of
the
totemic
species
are
really
believed
to
incarnate
the
ancestors
the
members
of
foreign
clans
would
not
be
allowed
to
eat
their
flesh
freely
in
reality
it
is
not
to
the
animal
as
such
that
the
cult
is
addressed
but
to
the
emblem
and
the
image
of
the
totem
now
between
this
religion
of
the
emblem
and
the
there
is
no
connection
whatsoever
while
tylor
derives
totemism
from
the
jevons
derives
it
from
the
and
here
is
how
he
does
so
when
under
the
impulse
of
the
surprise
occasioned
by
the
irregularities
observed
in
the
course
of
phenomena
men
had
once
peopled
the
world
with
supernatural
beings
they
felt
the
need
of
making
agreements
with
these
redoubtable
forces
with
which
they
had
surrounded
themselves
they
understood
that
the
best
way
to
escape
being
overwhelmed
by
them
was
to
ally
themselves
to
some
of
them
and
thus
make
sure
of
their
aid
but
at
this
period
of
history
men
knew
no
other
form
of
alliance
and
association
than
the
one
resulting
from
kinship
all
the
members
of
a
single
clan
aid
each
other
mutually
because
they
are
kindred
or
as
amounts
to
the
same
thing
because
they
think
they
are
on
the
other
hand
different
clans
treat
each
other
as
enemies
because
they
are
of
different
blood
so
the
only
way
of
assuring
themselves
of
the
support
of
these
supernatural
beings
was
to
adopt
them
as
kindred
and
to
be
adopted
by
them
in
the
same
quality
the
processes
of
the
permitted
them
to
attain
this
result
quite
easily
but
since
at
this
period
the
individual
did
not
yet
have
a
real
personality
and
was
regarded
only
as
a
part
of
his
group
or
clan
it
was
the
clan
as
a
whole
and
not
the
individual
which
collectively
contracted
this
relationship
for
the
same
reason
it
was
contracted
not
with
a
particular
object
but
with
the
natural
group
or
species
of
which
this
object
was
a
part
for
men
think
of
the
world
as
they
think
of
themselves
and
just
as
they
could
not
conceive
themselves
apart
from
their
clans
so
they
were
unable
to
conceive
of
anything
else
as
distinct
from
the
species
to
which
it
belonged
now
a
species
of
things
united
to
a
clan
by
a
bond
of
kinship
is
says
jevons
a
totem
in
fact
it
is
certain
that
totemism
implies
the
close
association
of
a
clan
to
a
determined
category
of
objects
but
that
this
association
was
contracted
with
a
deliberate
design
and
in
the
full
consciousness
of
an
end
sought
after
as
jevons
would
have
us
believe
is
a
statement
having
but
little
harmony
with
what
history
teaches
religions
are
too
complex
and
answer
to
needs
that
are
too
many
and
too
obscure
to
have
their
origin
in
a
premeditated
act
of
the
will
and
while
it
sins
through
this
hypothesis
is
also
highly
improbable
it
says
that
men
sought
to
assure
themselves
of
the
aid
of
the
supernatural
beings
upon
which
things
depend
then
they
should
preferably
have
addressed
themselves
to
the
most
powerful
of
these
and
to
those
whose
protection
promised
to
be
the
most
beneficial
but
quite
on
the
contrary
the
beings
with
whom
they
have
formed
this
mystic
kinship
are
often
among
the
most
humble
which
exist
also
if
it
were
only
a
question
of
making
allies
and
defenders
they
would
have
tried
to
make
as
many
as
possible
for
one
can
not
be
defended
too
well
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
clan
systematically
contents
itself
with
a
single
totem
that
is
to
say
with
one
single
protector
leaving
the
other
clans
to
enjoy
their
own
in
perfect
liberty
each
group
confines
itself
within
its
own
religious
domain
never
seeking
to
trespass
upon
that
of
its
neighbours
this
reserve
and
moderation
are
inexplicable
according
to
the
hypothesis
under
consideration
ii
moreover
all
these
theories
are
wrong
in
omitting
one
question
which
dominates
the
whole
subject
we
have
seen
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
totemism
that
of
the
individual
and
that
of
the
clan
there
is
too
evident
a
kinship
between
the
two
for
them
not
to
have
some
connection
with
each
other
so
we
may
well
ask
if
one
is
not
derived
from
the
other
and
in
the
case
of
an
affirmative
answer
which
is
the
more
primitive
according
to
the
solution
accepted
the
problem
of
the
origins
of
totemism
will
be
posed
in
different
terms
this
question
becomes
all
the
more
necessary
because
of
its
general
interest
individual
totemism
is
an
individual
aspect
of
the
totemic
cult
then
if
it
was
the
primitive
fact
we
must
say
that
religion
is
born
in
the
consciousness
of
the
individual
that
before
all
else
it
answers
to
individual
aspirations
and
that
its
collective
form
is
merely
secondary
the
desire
for
an
undue
simplicity
with
which
ethnologists
and
sociologists
are
too
frequently
inspired
has
naturally
led
many
scholars
to
explain
here
as
elsewhere
the
complex
by
the
simple
the
totem
of
the
group
by
that
of
the
individual
such
in
fact
is
the
theory
sustained
by
frazer
in
his
by
hill
tout
by
miss
fletcher
by
boas
and
by
swanton
it
has
the
additional
advantage
of
being
in
harmony
with
the
conception
of
religion
which
is
currently
held
this
is
quite
generally
regarded
as
something
intimate
and
personal
from
this
point
of
view
the
totem
of
the
clan
can
only
be
an
individual
totem
which
has
become
generalized
some
eminent
man
having
found
from
experience
the
value
of
a
totem
he
chose
for
himself
by
his
own
free
will
transmitted
it
to
his
descendants
these
latter
multiplying
as
time
went
on
finally
formed
the
extended
family
known
as
a
clan
and
thus
the
totem
became
collective
hill
tout
believes
that
he
has
found
a
proof
supporting
this
theory
in
the
way
totemism
has
spread
among
certain
societies
of
america
especially
among
the
salish
and
certain
indians
on
the
thompson
river
individual
totemism
and
the
clan
totemism
are
both
found
among
these
peoples
but
they
either
do
not
in
the
same
tribe
or
else
when
they
do
they
are
not
equally
developed
they
vary
in
an
inverse
proportion
to
each
other
where
the
clan
totem
tends
to
become
the
general
rule
the
individual
totem
tends
to
disappear
and
is
that
not
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
first
is
a
more
recent
form
of
the
second
which
excludes
it
by
replacing
it
mythology
seems
to
confirm
this
interpretation
in
these
same
societies
in
fact
the
ancestor
of
the
clan
is
not
a
totemic
animal
the
founder
of
the
group
is
generally
represented
in
the
form
of
a
human
being
who
at
a
certain
time
had
entered
into
familiar
relations
with
a
fabulous
animal
from
whom
he
received
his
totemic
emblem
this
emblem
together
with
the
special
powers
which
are
attached
to
it
was
then
passed
on
to
the
descendants
of
this
mythical
hero
by
right
of
heritage
so
these
people
themselves
seem
to
consider
the
collective
totem
as
an
individual
one
perpetuated
in
the
same
family
moreover
it
still
happens
that
a
father
transmits
his
own
totem
to
his
children
so
if
we
imagine
that
the
collective
totem
had
in
a
general
way
this
same
origin
we
are
assuming
that
the
same
thing
took
place
in
the
past
which
is
still
observable
it
is
still
to
be
explained
whence
the
individual
totem
comes
the
reply
given
to
this
question
varies
with
different
authors
hill
tout
considers
it
a
particular
case
of
fetishism
feeling
himself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
dreaded
spirits
the
individual
experienced
that
sentiment
which
we
have
just
seen
jevons
attribute
to
the
clan
in
order
that
he
might
continue
to
exist
he
sought
some
powerful
protector
in
this
mysterious
world
thus
the
use
of
a
personal
totem
became
established
for
frazer
this
same
institution
was
rather
a
subterfuge
or
trick
of
war
invented
by
men
that
they
might
escape
from
certain
dangers
it
is
known
that
according
to
a
belief
which
is
very
widespread
in
a
large
number
of
inferior
societies
the
human
soul
is
able
without
great
inconvenience
to
quit
the
body
it
inhabits
for
a
while
howsoever
far
away
it
may
be
it
continues
to
animate
this
body
by
a
sort
of
detached
control
then
in
certain
critical
moments
when
life
is
supposed
to
be
particularly
menaced
it
may
be
desirable
to
withdraw
the
soul
from
the
body
and
lead
it
to
some
place
or
into
some
object
where
it
will
be
in
greater
security
in
fact
there
are
a
certain
number
of
practices
whose
object
is
to
withdraw
the
soul
in
order
to
protect
it
from
some
danger
either
real
or
imaginary
for
example
at
the
moment
when
men
are
going
to
enter
a
house
a
magician
removes
their
souls
and
puts
them
in
a
sack
to
be
saved
and
returned
to
their
proprietors
after
the
has
been
crossed
this
is
because
the
moment
when
one
enters
a
new
house
is
exceptionally
critical
one
may
have
disturbed
and
consequently
offended
the
spirits
who
reside
in
the
ground
and
especially
under
the
sill
and
if
precautions
are
not
taken
these
could
make
a
man
pay
dearly
for
his
audacity
but
when
this
danger
is
once
passed
and
one
has
been
able
to
anticipate
their
anger
and
even
to
make
sure
of
their
favour
through
the
accomplishment
of
certain
rites
the
souls
may
safely
retake
their
accustomed
place
it
is
this
same
belief
which
gave
birth
to
the
personal
totem
to
protect
themselves
from
sorcery
men
thought
it
wise
to
hide
their
souls
in
the
anonymous
crowd
of
some
species
of
animal
or
vegetable
but
after
these
relations
had
once
been
established
each
individual
found
himself
closely
united
to
the
animal
or
plant
where
his
own
vital
principle
was
believed
to
reside
two
beings
so
closely
united
were
finally
thought
to
be
practically
indistinguishable
men
believed
that
each
participated
in
the
nature
of
the
other
when
this
belief
had
once
been
accepted
it
facilitated
and
hastened
the
transformation
of
the
personal
totem
into
an
hereditary
and
consequently
a
collective
totem
for
it
seemed
quite
evident
that
this
kinship
of
nature
should
be
transmitted
hereditarily
from
father
to
child
we
shall
not
stop
to
discuss
these
two
explanations
of
the
individual
totem
at
length
they
are
ingenious
fabrications
of
the
mind
but
they
completely
lack
all
positive
proof
if
we
are
going
to
reduce
totemism
to
fetishism
we
must
first
establish
that
the
latter
is
prior
to
the
former
now
not
merely
is
no
fact
brought
forward
to
support
this
hypothesis
but
it
is
even
contradicted
by
everything
that
we
know
the
group
of
rites
going
under
the
name
of
fetishism
seem
to
appear
only
among
peoples
who
have
already
attained
to
a
certain
degree
of
civilization
but
it
is
a
species
of
cult
unknown
in
australia
it
is
true
that
some
have
described
the
churinga
as
a
fetish
but
even
supposing
that
this
qualification
were
justified
it
would
not
prove
the
priority
which
is
postulated
quite
on
the
contrary
the
churinga
presupposes
totemism
since
it
is
essentially
an
instrument
of
the
totemic
cult
and
owes
the
virtues
attributed
to
it
to
totemic
beliefs
alone
as
for
the
theory
of
frazer
it
presupposes
a
thoroughgoing
idiocy
on
the
part
of
the
primitive
which
known
facts
do
not
allow
us
to
attribute
to
him
he
does
have
a
logic
however
strange
this
may
at
times
appear
now
unless
he
were
completely
deprived
of
it
he
could
never
be
guilty
of
the
reasoning
imputed
to
him
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
he
should
believe
it
possible
to
assure
the
survival
of
his
soul
by
hiding
it
in
a
secret
and
inaccessible
place
as
so
many
heroes
of
myths
and
legends
are
said
to
have
done
but
why
should
he
think
it
safer
in
the
body
of
an
animal
than
in
his
own
of
course
if
it
were
thus
lost
in
space
it
might
have
a
chance
to
escape
the
spells
of
a
magician
more
readily
but
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
prepared
for
the
blows
of
hunters
it
is
a
strange
way
of
sheltering
it
to
place
it
in
a
material
form
exposing
it
to
risks
at
every
instant
but
above
all
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
whole
people
should
allow
themselves
to
be
carried
into
such
an
aberration
finally
in
a
very
large
number
of
cases
the
function
of
the
individual
totem
is
very
different
from
that
assigned
it
by
frazer
before
all
else
it
is
a
means
of
conferring
extraordinary
powers
upon
magicians
hunters
or
warriors
as
to
the
kinship
of
the
man
and
the
thing
with
all
the
inconveniences
it
implies
it
is
accepted
as
a
consequence
of
the
rite
but
it
is
not
desired
in
its
and
for
itself
there
is
still
less
occasion
for
delaying
over
this
controversy
since
it
concerns
no
real
problem
what
we
must
know
before
everything
else
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
totem
is
really
a
primitive
fact
from
which
the
collective
totem
was
derived
for
according
to
the
reply
given
to
this
question
we
must
seek
the
home
of
the
religious
life
in
one
or
the
other
of
two
opposite
directions
against
the
hypothesis
of
hill
tout
miss
fletcher
boas
and
frazer
there
is
such
an
array
of
decisive
facts
that
one
is
surprised
that
it
has
been
so
readily
and
so
generally
accepted
in
the
first
place
we
know
that
a
man
frequently
has
the
greatest
interest
not
only
in
respecting
but
also
in
making
his
companions
respect
the
species
serving
him
as
personal
totem
his
own
life
is
connected
with
it
then
if
collective
totemism
were
only
a
generalized
form
of
individual
totemism
it
too
should
repose
upon
this
same
principle
not
only
should
the
men
of
a
clan
abstain
from
killing
and
eating
their
themselves
but
they
should
also
do
all
in
their
power
to
force
this
same
abstention
upon
others
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
far
from
imposing
such
a
renunciation
upon
the
whole
tribe
each
clan
by
rites
which
we
shall
describe
below
takes
care
that
the
plant
or
animal
whose
name
it
bears
shall
increase
and
prosper
so
as
to
assure
an
abundant
supply
of
food
for
the
other
clans
so
we
must
at
least
admit
that
in
becoming
collective
individual
totemism
was
transformed
profoundly
and
we
must
therefore
account
for
this
transformation
in
the
second
place
how
is
it
possible
to
explain
from
this
point
of
view
the
fact
that
except
where
totemism
is
in
full
decay
two
clans
of
a
single
tribe
always
have
different
totems
it
seems
that
nothing
prevents
two
or
several
members
of
a
single
tribe
even
when
there
is
no
kinship
between
them
from
choosing
their
personal
totem
in
the
same
animal
species
and
passing
it
on
to
their
descendants
does
it
not
happen
that
two
distinct
families
have
the
same
name
the
carefully
regulated
way
in
which
the
totems
and
are
divided
up
first
between
the
two
phratries
and
then
among
the
various
clans
of
the
phratry
obviously
presupposes
a
social
agreement
and
a
collective
organization
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
totemism
is
something
more
than
an
individual
practice
spontaneously
generalized
moreover
collective
totemism
can
not
be
deduced
from
individual
totemism
except
by
a
misunderstanding
of
the
differences
separating
the
two
the
one
is
acquired
by
the
child
at
birth
it
is
a
part
of
his
civil
status
the
other
is
acquired
during
the
course
of
his
life
it
presupposes
the
accomplishment
of
a
determined
rite
and
a
change
of
condition
some
seek
to
diminish
this
distance
by
inserting
between
the
two
as
a
sort
of
middle
term
the
right
of
each
possessor
of
a
totem
to
transmit
it
to
whomsoever
he
pleases
but
wherever
these
transfers
do
take
place
they
are
rare
and
relatively
exceptional
acts
they
can
not
be
performed
except
by
magicians
or
other
personages
invested
with
special
powers
in
any
case
they
are
possible
only
through
ritual
ceremonies
which
bring
about
the
change
so
it
is
necessary
to
explain
how
this
prerogative
of
a
few
became
the
right
of
all
how
that
which
at
first
implied
a
profound
change
in
the
religious
and
moral
constitution
of
the
individual
was
able
to
become
an
element
of
this
constitution
and
finally
how
a
transmission
which
at
first
was
the
consequence
of
a
rite
was
later
believed
to
operate
automatically
from
the
nature
of
things
and
without
the
intervention
of
any
human
will
in
support
of
his
interpretation
hill
tout
claims
that
certain
myths
give
the
totem
of
the
clan
an
individual
origin
they
tell
how
the
totemic
emblem
was
acquired
by
some
special
individual
who
then
transmitted
it
to
his
descendants
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
these
myths
are
all
taken
from
the
indian
tribes
of
north
america
which
are
societies
arrived
at
a
rather
high
degree
of
culture
how
could
a
mythology
so
far
removed
from
the
origins
of
things
aid
in
reconstituting
the
primitive
form
of
an
institution
with
any
degree
of
certainty
there
are
many
chances
for
intermediate
causes
to
have
gravely
disfigured
the
recollection
which
these
people
have
been
able
to
retain
moreover
it
is
very
easy
to
answer
these
myths
with
others
which
seem
much
more
primitive
and
whose
signification
is
quite
different
the
totem
is
there
represented
as
the
very
being
from
whom
the
clan
is
descended
so
it
must
be
that
it
constitutes
the
substance
of
the
clan
men
have
it
within
them
from
their
birth
it
is
a
part
of
their
very
flesh
and
blood
so
far
are
they
from
having
received
it
from
without
more
than
that
the
very
myths
upon
which
hill
tout
relies
contain
an
echo
of
this
ancient
conception
the
founder
who
gave
his
name
to
the
clan
certainly
had
a
human
form
but
he
was
a
man
who
after
living
among
animals
of
a
certain
species
finally
came
to
resemble
them
this
is
undoubtedly
because
a
time
came
when
the
mind
was
too
cultivated
to
admit
any
longer
as
it
had
formerly
done
that
men
might
have
been
born
of
animals
so
the
animal
ancestor
now
become
inconceivable
is
replaced
by
a
human
being
but
the
idea
persists
that
this
man
had
acquired
certain
characteristics
of
the
animal
either
by
imitation
or
by
some
other
process
thus
even
this
late
mythology
bears
the
mark
of
a
more
remote
epoch
when
the
totem
of
the
clan
was
never
regarded
as
a
sort
of
individual
creation
but
this
hypothesis
does
not
merely
raise
grave
logical
difficulties
it
is
contradicted
directly
by
the
following
facts
if
individual
totemism
were
the
initial
fact
it
should
be
more
developed
and
apparent
the
more
primitive
the
societies
are
and
inversely
it
should
lose
ground
and
disappear
before
the
other
among
the
more
advanced
peoples
now
it
is
the
contrary
which
is
true
the
australian
tribes
are
far
behind
those
of
north
america
yet
australia
is
the
classic
land
of
collective
totemism
the
great
majority
of
the
tribes
it
alone
is
found
while
we
do
not
know
a
single
one
where
individual
totemism
alone
is
this
latter
is
found
in
a
characteristic
form
only
in
an
infinitesimal
number
of
tribes
even
where
it
is
met
with
it
is
generally
in
a
rudimentary
form
it
is
made
up
of
individual
and
optional
practices
having
no
generality
only
magicians
are
acquainted
with
the
art
of
creating
mysterious
relationships
with
species
of
animals
to
which
they
are
not
related
by
nature
ordinary
people
do
not
enjoy
this
privilege
in
america
on
the
contrary
the
collective
totem
is
in
full
decadence
in
the
societies
of
the
especially
its
religious
character
is
almost
gone
inversely
the
individual
totem
plays
a
considerable
rôle
among
these
same
peoples
a
very
great
efficacy
is
attributed
to
it
it
has
become
a
real
public
institution
this
is
because
it
is
the
sign
of
a
higher
civilization
this
is
undoubtedly
the
explanation
of
the
inversion
of
these
two
forms
of
totemism
which
hill
tout
believes
he
has
observed
among
the
salish
if
in
those
parts
where
collective
totemism
is
the
most
fully
developed
the
other
form
is
almost
lacking
it
is
not
because
the
second
has
disappeared
before
the
first
but
rather
because
the
conditions
necessary
for
its
existence
have
not
yet
been
fully
realized
but
a
fact
which
is
still
more
conclusive
is
that
individual
totemism
far
from
having
given
birth
to
the
totemism
of
the
clan
presupposes
this
latter
it
is
within
the
frame
of
collective
totemism
that
it
is
born
and
lives
it
is
an
integral
part
of
it
in
fact
in
those
very
societies
where
it
is
preponderating
the
novices
do
not
have
the
right
of
taking
any
animal
as
their
individual
totem
to
each
clan
a
certain
definite
number
of
species
are
assigned
outside
of
which
it
may
not
choose
in
return
those
belonging
to
it
thus
are
its
exclusive
property
members
of
other
clans
may
not
usurp
them
they
are
thought
to
have
relations
of
close
dependence
upon
the
one
serving
as
totem
to
the
clan
as
a
whole
there
are
even
cases
where
it
is
quite
possible
to
observe
these
relations
the
individual
aspect
represents
a
part
or
a
particular
aspect
of
the
collective
totem
among
the
wotjobaluk
each
member
of
the
clan
considers
the
personal
totems
of
his
companions
as
being
his
own
after
a
fashion
so
they
are
probably
now
the
supposes
the
totem
as
the
species
supposes
the
class
thus
the
first
form
of
individual
religion
met
with
in
history
appears
not
as
the
active
principle
of
all
public
religion
but
on
the
contrary
as
a
simple
aspect
of
this
latter
the
cult
which
the
individual
organizes
for
himself
in
his
own
inner
conscience
far
from
being
the
germ
of
the
collective
cult
is
only
this
latter
adapted
to
the
personal
needs
of
the
individual
iii
in
a
more
recent
study
which
the
works
of
spencer
and
gillen
suggested
to
him
frazer
has
attempted
to
substitute
a
new
explanation
of
totemism
for
the
one
he
first
proposed
and
which
we
have
just
been
discussing
it
rests
on
the
postulate
that
the
totemism
of
the
arunta
is
the
most
primitive
which
we
know
frazer
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
scarcely
differs
from
the
really
and
absolutely
original
type
the
singular
thing
about
it
is
that
the
totems
are
attached
neither
to
persons
nor
to
determined
groups
of
persons
but
to
localities
in
fact
each
totem
has
its
centre
at
some
definite
spot
it
is
there
that
the
souls
of
the
first
ancestors
who
founded
the
totemic
group
at
the
beginning
of
time
are
believed
to
have
their
preferred
residence
it
is
there
that
the
sanctuary
is
located
where
the
churinga
are
kept
there
the
cult
is
celebrated
it
is
also
this
geographical
distribution
of
totems
which
determines
the
manner
in
which
the
clans
are
recruited
the
child
has
neither
the
totem
of
his
father
nor
that
of
his
mother
but
the
one
whose
centre
is
at
the
spot
where
the
mother
believes
that
she
felt
the
first
symptoms
of
approaching
maternity
for
it
is
said
that
the
arunta
is
ignorant
of
the
exact
relation
existing
between
generation
and
the
sexual
act
he
thinks
that
every
conception
is
due
to
a
sort
of
mystic
fecundation
according
to
him
it
is
due
to
the
entrance
of
the
soul
of
an
ancestor
into
the
body
of
a
woman
and
its
becoming
the
principle
of
a
new
life
there
so
at
the
moment
when
a
woman
feels
the
first
tremblings
of
the
child
she
imagines
that
one
of
the
souls
whose
principal
residence
is
at
the
place
where
she
happens
to
be
has
just
entered
into
her
as
the
child
who
is
presently
born
is
merely
the
reincarnation
of
this
ancestor
he
necessarily
has
the
same
totem
thus
his
totem
is
determined
by
the
locality
where
he
is
believed
to
have
been
mysteriously
conceived
now
it
is
this
local
totemism
which
represents
the
original
form
of
totemism
at
most
it
is
separated
from
this
by
a
very
short
step
this
is
how
frazer
explains
its
genesis
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
woman
realizes
that
she
is
pregnant
she
must
think
that
the
spirit
by
which
she
feels
herself
possessed
has
come
to
her
from
the
objects
about
her
and
especially
from
one
of
those
which
attract
her
attention
at
the
moment
so
if
she
is
engaged
in
plucking
a
plant
or
watching
an
animal
she
believes
that
the
soul
of
this
plant
or
animal
has
passed
into
her
among
the
things
to
which
she
will
be
particularly
inclined
to
attribute
her
condition
are
in
the
first
place
the
things
she
has
just
eaten
if
she
has
recently
eaten
emu
or
yam
she
will
not
doubt
that
an
emu
or
yam
has
been
born
in
her
and
is
developing
under
these
conditions
it
is
evident
how
the
child
in
his
turn
will
be
considered
a
sort
of
yam
or
emu
how
he
regards
himself
as
a
relative
of
the
plant
or
animal
of
the
same
species
how
he
has
sympathy
and
regard
for
them
how
he
refuses
to
eat
them
etc
from
this
moment
totemism
exists
in
its
essential
traits
it
is
the
native
theory
of
conception
that
gave
rise
to
it
so
frazer
calls
this
primitive
totemism
it
is
from
this
original
type
that
all
the
other
forms
of
totemism
are
derived
when
several
women
had
one
after
the
other
felt
the
first
premonitions
of
maternity
at
the
same
spot
and
under
the
same
circumstances
the
place
would
come
to
be
regarded
as
haunted
by
spirits
of
a
peculiar
sort
and
so
the
whole
country
might
in
time
be
dotted
over
with
totem
centres
and
distributed
into
totem
districts
this
is
how
the
local
totemism
of
the
arunta
originated
in
order
that
the
totems
may
subsequently
be
detached
from
their
territorial
base
it
is
sufficient
to
think
that
the
ancestral
souls
instead
of
remaining
immutably
fixed
to
a
determined
spot
are
able
to
move
freely
over
the
surface
of
the
territory
and
that
in
their
voyages
they
follow
the
men
and
women
of
the
same
totem
as
themselves
in
this
way
a
woman
may
be
impregnated
by
her
own
totem
or
that
of
her
husband
though
residing
in
a
different
totemic
district
according
to
whether
it
is
believed
that
it
is
the
ancestor
of
the
husband
or
of
the
wife
who
thus
follow
the
family
about
seeking
occasions
to
reincarnate
themselves
the
totem
of
the
child
will
be
that
of
his
father
or
mother
in
fact
it
is
in
just
this
way
that
the
guanji
and
umbaia
on
the
one
hand
and
the
urabunna
on
the
other
explain
their
systems
of
filiation
but
this
theory
like
that
of
tylor
rests
upon
a
begging
of
the
question
if
he
is
to
imagine
that
human
souls
are
the
souls
of
animals
or
plants
one
must
believe
beforehand
that
men
take
either
from
the
animal
or
vegetable
world
whatever
is
most
essential
in
them
now
this
belief
is
one
of
those
at
the
foundation
of
totemism
to
state
it
as
something
evident
is
therefore
to
take
for
granted
that
which
is
to
be
explained
moreover
from
this
point
of
view
the
religious
character
of
the
totem
is
entirely
inexplicable
for
the
vague
belief
in
an
obscure
kinship
between
the
man
and
the
animal
is
not
enough
to
found
a
cult
this
confusion
of
distinct
kingdoms
could
never
result
in
dividing
the
world
into
sacred
and
profane
it
is
true
that
being
consistent
with
himself
frazer
refuses
to
admit
that
totemism
is
a
religion
under
the
pretext
that
he
finds
in
it
neither
spiritual
beings
nor
prayers
nor
invocations
nor
offerings
etc
according
to
him
it
is
only
a
system
of
magic
by
which
he
means
a
sort
of
crude
and
erroneous
science
a
first
effort
to
discover
the
laws
of
things
but
we
know
how
inexact
this
conception
both
of
magic
and
of
religion
is
we
have
a
religion
as
soon
as
the
sacred
is
distinguished
from
the
profane
and
we
have
seen
that
totemism
is
a
vast
system
of
sacred
things
if
we
are
to
explain
it
we
must
therefore
show
how
it
happened
that
these
things
were
stamped
with
this
character
but
he
does
not
even
raise
this
problem
but
this
system
is
completely
overthrown
by
the
fact
that
the
postulate
upon
which
it
rests
can
no
longer
be
sustained
the
whole
argument
of
frazer
supposes
that
the
local
totemism
of
the
arunta
is
the
most
primitive
we
know
and
especially
that
it
is
clearly
prior
to
hereditary
totemism
either
in
the
paternal
or
the
maternal
line
now
as
soon
as
the
facts
contained
in
the
first
volume
of
spencer
and
gillen
were
at
our
disposal
we
were
able
to
conjecture
that
there
had
been
a
time
in
the
history
of
the
arunta
people
when
the
totems
instead
of
being
attached
to
localities
were
transmitted
hereditarily
from
mother
to
child
this
conjecture
is
definitely
proved
by
the
new
facts
discovered
by
strehlow
which
only
confirm
the
previous
observations
of
schulze
in
fact
both
of
these
authors
tell
us
that
even
now
in
addition
to
his
local
totem
each
arunta
has
another
which
is
completely
independent
of
all
geographical
conditions
and
which
belongs
to
him
as
a
birthright
it
is
his
mother
this
second
totem
just
like
the
first
is
considered
a
powerful
friend
and
protector
by
the
natives
which
looks
after
their
food
warns
them
of
possible
dangers
etc
they
have
the
right
of
taking
part
in
its
cult
when
they
are
buried
the
corpse
is
laid
so
that
the
face
is
turned
towards
the
region
of
the
maternal
totemic
centre
so
after
a
fashion
this
centre
is
also
that
of
the
deceased
in
fact
it
is
given
the
name
which
is
translated
camp
of
the
totem
which
is
associated
with
me
so
it
is
certain
that
among
the
arunta
hereditary
totemism
in
the
uterine
line
is
not
later
than
local
totemism
but
on
the
contrary
must
have
preceded
it
for
the
maternal
totem
has
only
an
accessory
and
supplementary
rôle
it
is
a
second
totem
which
explains
how
it
was
able
to
escape
observation
as
attentive
and
careful
as
that
of
spencer
and
gillen
but
in
order
that
it
should
be
able
to
retain
this
secondary
place
being
employed
along
with
the
local
totem
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
it
held
the
primary
place
in
the
religious
life
it
is
in
part
a
fallen
totem
but
one
recalling
an
epoch
when
the
totemic
organization
of
the
arunta
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
so
the
whole
superstructure
of
frazer
system
is
undermined
at
its
foundation
iv
although
andrew
lang
has
actively
contested
this
theory
of
frazer
the
one
he
proposes
himself
in
his
later
works
resembles
it
on
more
than
one
point
like
frazer
he
makes
totemism
consist
in
the
belief
in
a
sort
of
consubstantiality
of
the
man
and
the
animal
but
he
explains
it
differently
he
derives
it
entirely
from
the
fact
that
the
totem
is
a
name
as
soon
as
human
groups
were
founded
each
one
felt
the
need
of
distinguishing
between
the
neighbouring
groups
with
which
it
came
into
contact
and
with
this
end
in
view
it
gave
them
different
names
the
names
were
preferably
chosen
from
the
surrounding
flora
and
fauna
because
animals
and
plants
can
easily
be
designated
by
movements
or
represented
by
drawings
the
more
or
less
precise
resemblances
which
men
may
have
with
such
and
such
objects
determined
the
way
in
which
these
collective
denominations
were
distributed
among
the
groups
now
it
is
a
fact
that
to
the
early
mind
names
and
the
things
known
by
names
are
in
a
mystic
and
transcendental
connection
of
for
example
the
name
of
an
individual
is
not
considered
as
a
simple
word
or
conventional
sign
but
as
an
essential
part
of
the
individual
himself
so
if
it
were
the
name
of
an
animal
the
man
would
have
to
believe
that
he
himself
had
the
most
characteristic
attributes
of
this
same
animal
this
theory
would
become
better
and
better
accredited
as
the
historic
origins
of
these
denominations
became
more
remote
and
were
effaced
from
the
memory
myths
arose
to
make
this
strange
ambiguity
of
human
nature
more
easily
representable
in
the
mind
to
explain
this
they
imagined
that
the
animal
was
the
ancestor
of
the
men
or
else
that
the
two
were
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
thus
came
the
conception
of
bonds
of
kinship
uniting
each
clan
to
the
animal
species
whose
name
it
bore
with
the
origins
of
this
fabulous
kinship
once
explained
it
seems
to
our
author
that
totemism
no
longer
contains
a
mystery
but
whence
comes
the
religious
character
of
the
totemic
beliefs
and
practices
for
the
fact
that
a
man
considers
himself
an
animal
of
a
certain
species
does
not
explain
why
he
attributes
marvellous
powers
to
this
species
and
especially
why
he
renders
a
cult
to
the
images
symbolizing
to
this
question
lang
gives
the
same
response
as
frazer
he
denies
that
totemism
is
a
religion
i
find
in
australia
he
says
no
example
of
religious
practices
such
as
praying
to
nourishing
or
burying
the
totem
it
was
only
at
a
later
epoch
when
it
was
already
established
that
totemism
was
drawn
into
and
surrounded
by
a
system
of
conceptions
properly
called
religious
according
to
a
remark
of
howitt
when
the
natives
undertake
the
explanation
of
the
totemic
institutions
they
do
not
attribute
them
to
the
totems
themselves
nor
to
a
man
but
to
some
supernatural
being
such
as
bunjil
or
baiame
accepting
this
evidence
says
lang
one
source
of
the
character
of
totemism
is
at
once
revealed
the
totemist
obeys
the
decree
of
bunjil
or
baiame
as
the
cretans
obeyed
the
divine
decrees
given
by
zeus
to
minos
now
according
to
lang
the
idea
of
these
great
divinities
arose
outside
of
the
totemic
system
so
this
is
not
a
religion
in
itself
it
has
merely
been
given
a
religious
colouring
by
contact
with
a
genuine
religion
but
these
very
myths
contradict
lang
conception
of
totemism
if
the
australians
had
regarded
totemism
as
something
human
and
profane
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
them
to
make
a
divine
institution
out
of
it
if
on
the
other
hand
they
have
felt
the
need
of
connecting
it
with
a
divinity
it
is
because
they
have
seen
a
sacred
character
in
it
so
these
mythological
interpretations
prove
the
religious
nature
of
totemism
but
do
not
explain
it
moreover
lang
himself
recognizes
that
this
solution
is
not
sufficient
he
realizes
that
totemic
things
are
treated
with
a
religious
respect
that
especially
the
blood
of
an
animal
as
well
as
that
of
a
man
is
the
object
of
numerous
interdictions
or
as
he
says
taboos
which
this
comparatively
late
mythology
can
not
explain
then
where
do
they
come
from
here
are
the
words
with
which
lang
answers
this
question
as
soon
as
the
groups
evolved
the
universally
diffused
beliefs
about
the
or
or
mystically
sacred
quality
of
the
blood
as
the
life
they
would
also
develop
the
various
taboos
the
words
and
as
we
shall
see
in
the
following
chapter
involve
the
very
idea
of
itself
the
one
is
taken
from
the
language
of
the
sioux
the
other
from
that
of
the
melanesian
peoples
to
explain
the
sacred
character
of
totemic
things
by
postulating
this
characteristic
is
to
answer
the
question
by
the
question
what
we
must
find
out
is
whence
this
idea
of
comes
and
how
it
comes
to
be
applied
to
the
totem
and
all
that
is
derived
from
it
as
long
as
these
two
questions
remain
unanswered
nothing
is
explained
v
we
have
now
passed
in
review
all
the
principal
explanations
which
have
been
given
for
totemic
beliefs
leaving
to
each
of
them
its
own
individuality
but
now
that
this
examination
is
finished
we
may
state
one
criticism
which
addresses
itself
to
all
these
systems
alike
if
we
stick
to
the
letter
of
the
formulæ
it
seems
that
these
may
be
arranged
in
two
groups
some
frazer
lang
deny
the
religious
character
of
totemism
in
reality
that
amounts
to
denying
the
facts
others
recognize
this
but
think
that
they
can
explain
it
by
deriving
it
from
an
anterior
religion
out
of
which
totemism
developed
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
distinction
is
only
apparent
the
first
group
is
contained
within
the
second
neither
frazer
nor
lang
have
been
able
to
maintain
their
principle
systematically
and
explain
totemism
as
if
it
were
not
a
religion
by
the
very
force
of
facts
they
have
been
compelled
to
slip
ideas
of
a
religious
nature
into
their
explanations
we
have
just
seen
how
lang
calls
in
the
idea
of
sacredness
which
is
the
cardinal
idea
of
all
religion
frazer
on
his
side
in
each
of
the
theories
which
he
has
successively
proposed
appeals
openly
to
the
idea
of
souls
or
spirits
for
according
to
him
totemism
came
from
the
fact
that
men
thought
they
could
deposit
their
souls
in
safety
in
some
external
object
or
else
that
they
attributed
conception
to
a
sort
of
spiritual
fecundation
of
which
a
spirit
was
the
agent
now
a
soul
and
still
more
a
spirit
are
sacred
things
and
the
object
of
rites
so
the
ideas
expressing
them
are
essentially
religious
and
it
is
therefore
in
vain
that
frazer
makes
totemism
a
mere
system
of
magic
for
he
succeeds
in
explaining
it
only
in
the
terms
of
another
religion
we
have
already
pointed
out
the
insufficiencies
of
animism
and
naturism
so
one
may
not
have
recourse
to
them
as
tylor
and
jevons
do
without
exposing
himself
to
these
same
objections
yet
neither
frazer
nor
lang
seems
to
dream
of
the
possibility
of
another
hypothesis
on
the
other
hand
we
know
that
totemism
is
tightly
bound
up
with
the
most
primitive
social
system
which
we
know
and
in
all
probability
of
which
we
can
conceive
to
suppose
that
it
has
developed
out
of
another
religion
differing
from
it
only
in
degree
is
to
leave
the
data
of
observation
and
enter
into
the
domain
of
arbitrary
and
unverifiable
conjectures
if
we
wish
to
remain
in
harmony
with
the
results
we
have
already
obtained
it
is
necessary
that
while
affirming
the
religious
nature
of
totemism
we
abstain
from
deriving
it
from
another
different
religion
there
can
be
no
hope
of
assigning
it
ideas
as
its
cause
but
among
the
representations
entering
into
the
conditions
from
which
it
results
there
may
be
some
which
directly
suggest
a
religious
nature
of
themselves
these
are
the
ones
we
must
look
for
chapter
vi
origins
of
these
beliefs
notion
of
the
totemic
principle
or
mana
and
the
idea
of
since
individual
totemism
is
later
than
the
totemism
of
the
clan
and
even
seems
to
be
derived
from
it
it
is
to
this
latter
form
that
we
must
turn
first
of
all
but
as
the
analysis
which
we
have
just
made
of
it
has
resolved
it
into
a
multiplicity
of
beliefs
which
may
appear
quite
heterogeneous
before
going
farther
we
must
seek
to
learn
what
makes
its
unity
i
we
have
seen
that
totemism
places
the
figured
representations
of
the
totem
in
the
first
rank
of
the
things
it
considers
sacred
next
come
the
animals
or
vegetables
whose
name
the
clan
bears
and
finally
the
members
of
the
clan
since
all
these
things
are
sacred
in
the
same
way
though
to
different
degrees
their
religious
character
can
be
due
to
none
of
the
special
attributes
distinguishing
them
from
each
other
if
a
certain
species
of
animal
or
vegetable
is
the
object
of
a
reverential
fear
this
is
not
because
of
its
special
properties
for
the
human
members
of
the
clan
enjoy
this
same
privilege
though
to
a
slightly
inferior
degree
while
the
mere
image
of
this
same
plant
or
animal
inspires
an
even
more
pronounced
respect
the
similar
sentiments
inspired
by
these
different
sorts
of
things
in
the
mind
of
the
believer
which
give
them
their
sacred
character
can
evidently
come
only
from
some
common
principle
partaken
of
alike
by
the
totemic
emblems
the
men
of
the
clan
and
the
individuals
of
the
species
serving
as
totem
in
reality
it
is
to
this
common
principle
that
the
cult
is
addressed
in
other
words
totemism
is
the
religion
not
of
such
and
such
animals
or
men
or
images
but
of
an
anonymous
and
impersonal
force
found
in
each
of
these
beings
but
not
to
be
confounded
with
any
of
them
no
one
possesses
it
entirely
and
all
participate
in
it
it
is
so
completely
independent
of
the
particular
subjects
in
whom
it
incarnates
itself
that
it
precedes
them
and
survives
them
individuals
die
generations
pass
and
are
replaced
by
others
but
this
force
always
remains
actual
living
and
the
same
it
animates
the
generations
of
as
it
animated
those
of
yesterday
and
as
it
will
animate
those
of
taking
the
words
in
a
large
sense
we
may
say
that
it
is
the
god
adored
by
each
totemic
cult
yet
it
is
an
impersonal
god
without
name
or
history
immanent
in
the
world
and
diffused
in
an
innumerable
multitude
of
things
but
even
now
we
have
only
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
real
ubiquity
of
this
entity
it
is
not
merely
found
in
the
whole
totemic
species
the
whole
clan
and
all
the
objects
symbolizing
the
totem
the
circle
of
its
action
extends
beyond
that
in
fact
we
have
seen
that
in
addition
to
the
eminently
holy
things
all
those
attributed
to
the
clan
as
dependencies
of
the
principal
totem
have
this
same
character
to
a
certain
degree
they
also
have
something
religious
about
them
for
some
are
protected
by
interdictions
while
others
have
determined
functions
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
cult
their
religiousness
does
not
differ
in
kind
from
that
of
the
totem
under
which
they
are
classified
it
must
therefore
be
derived
from
the
same
source
so
it
is
because
the
totemic
god
to
use
again
the
metaphorical
expression
which
we
have
just
employed
is
in
them
just
as
it
is
in
the
species
serving
as
totem
and
in
the
men
of
the
clan
we
may
see
how
much
it
differs
from
the
beings
in
which
it
resides
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
soul
of
so
many
different
beings
but
the
australian
does
not
represent
this
impersonal
force
in
an
abstract
form
under
the
influence
of
causes
which
we
must
seek
he
has
been
led
to
conceive
it
under
the
form
of
an
animal
or
vegetable
species
or
in
a
word
of
a
visible
object
this
is
what
the
totem
really
consists
in
it
is
only
the
material
form
under
which
the
imagination
represents
this
immaterial
substance
this
energy
diffused
through
all
sorts
of
heterogeneous
things
which
alone
is
the
real
object
of
the
cult
we
are
now
in
a
better
condition
for
understanding
what
the
native
means
when
he
says
that
the
men
of
the
crow
phratry
for
example
are
crows
he
does
not
exactly
mean
to
say
that
they
are
crows
in
the
vulgar
and
empiric
sense
of
the
term
but
that
the
same
principle
is
found
in
all
of
them
which
is
their
most
essential
characteristic
which
they
have
in
common
with
the
animals
of
the
same
name
and
which
is
thought
of
under
the
external
form
of
a
crow
thus
the
universe
as
totemism
conceives
it
is
filled
and
animated
by
a
certain
number
of
forces
which
the
imagination
represents
in
forms
taken
with
only
a
few
exceptions
from
the
animal
or
vegetable
kingdoms
there
are
as
many
of
them
as
there
are
clans
in
the
tribe
and
each
of
them
is
also
found
in
certain
categories
of
things
of
which
it
is
the
essence
and
vital
principle
when
we
say
that
these
principles
are
forces
we
do
not
take
the
word
in
a
metaphorical
sense
they
act
just
like
veritable
forces
in
one
sense
they
are
even
material
forces
which
mechanically
engender
physical
effects
does
an
individual
come
in
contact
with
them
without
having
taken
proper
precautions
he
receives
a
shock
which
might
be
compared
to
the
effect
of
an
electric
discharge
sometimes
they
seem
to
conceive
of
these
as
a
sort
of
fluid
escaping
by
points
if
they
are
introduced
into
an
organism
not
made
to
receive
them
they
produce
sickness
and
death
by
a
wholly
automatic
action
outside
of
men
they
play
the
rôle
of
vital
principle
it
is
by
acting
on
them
we
shall
see
that
the
reproduction
of
the
species
is
assured
it
is
upon
them
that
the
universal
life
reposes
but
in
addition
to
this
physical
aspect
they
also
have
a
moral
character
when
someone
asks
a
native
why
he
observes
his
rites
he
replies
that
his
ancestors
always
have
observed
them
and
he
ought
to
follow
their
example
so
if
he
acts
in
a
certain
way
towards
the
totemic
beings
it
is
not
only
because
the
forces
resident
in
them
are
physically
redoubtable
but
because
he
feels
himself
morally
obliged
to
act
thus
he
has
the
feeling
that
he
is
obeying
an
imperative
that
he
is
fulfilling
a
duty
for
these
sacred
beings
he
has
not
merely
fear
but
also
respect
moreover
the
totem
is
the
source
of
the
moral
life
of
the
clan
all
the
beings
partaking
of
the
same
totemic
principle
consider
that
owing
to
this
very
fact
they
are
morally
bound
to
one
another
they
have
definite
duties
of
assistance
vendetta
towards
each
other
and
it
is
these
duties
which
constitute
kinship
so
while
the
totemic
principle
is
a
totemic
force
it
is
also
a
moral
power
so
we
shall
see
how
it
easily
transforms
itself
into
a
divinity
properly
moreover
there
is
nothing
here
which
is
special
to
totemism
even
in
the
most
advanced
religions
there
is
scarcely
a
god
who
has
not
kept
something
of
this
ambiguity
and
whose
functions
are
not
at
once
cosmic
and
moral
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
a
spiritual
discipline
every
religion
is
also
a
means
enabling
men
to
face
the
world
with
greater
confidence
even
for
the
christian
is
not
god
the
father
the
guardian
of
the
physical
order
as
well
as
the
legislator
and
the
judge
of
human
conduct
ii
perhaps
someone
will
ask
whether
in
interpreting
totemism
thus
we
do
not
endow
the
native
with
ideas
surpassing
the
limits
of
his
intellect
of
course
we
are
not
prepared
to
affirm
that
he
represents
these
forces
with
the
relative
clarity
which
we
have
been
able
to
give
to
them
in
our
analysis
we
are
able
to
show
quite
clearly
that
this
notion
is
implied
by
the
whole
system
of
beliefs
which
it
dominates
but
we
are
unable
to
say
how
far
it
is
conscious
and
how
far
on
the
contrary
it
is
only
implicit
and
confusedly
felt
there
is
no
way
of
determining
just
what
degree
of
clarity
an
idea
like
this
may
have
in
obscure
minds
but
it
is
well
shown
in
any
case
that
this
in
no
way
surpasses
the
capacities
of
the
primitive
mind
and
on
the
contrary
the
results
at
which
we
have
just
arrived
are
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
either
in
the
societies
closely
related
to
these
australian
tribes
or
even
in
these
tribes
themselves
we
find
in
an
explicit
form
conceptions
which
differ
from
the
preceding
only
by
shades
and
degrees
the
native
religions
of
samoa
have
certainly
passed
the
totemic
phase
real
gods
are
found
there
who
have
their
own
names
and
to
a
certain
degree
their
own
personal
physiognomy
yet
the
traces
of
totemism
are
hardly
contestable
in
fact
each
god
is
attached
to
a
group
either
local
or
domestic
just
as
the
totem
is
to
its
clan
then
each
of
these
gods
is
thought
of
as
immanent
in
a
special
species
of
animal
but
this
does
not
mean
that
he
resides
in
one
subject
in
particular
he
is
immanent
in
all
at
once
he
is
diffused
in
the
species
as
a
whole
when
an
animal
dies
the
men
of
the
group
who
venerate
it
weep
for
it
and
render
pious
duties
to
it
because
a
god
inhabits
it
but
the
god
is
not
dead
he
is
eternal
like
the
species
he
is
not
even
confused
with
the
present
generation
he
has
already
been
the
soul
of
the
preceding
one
as
he
will
be
the
soul
of
the
one
which
is
to
follow
so
he
has
all
the
characteristics
of
the
totemic
principle
he
is
the
totemic
principle
in
a
slightly
personal
form
by
the
imagination
but
still
we
must
not
exaggerate
a
personality
which
is
hardly
reconcilable
with
this
diffusion
and
ubiquity
if
its
contours
were
clearly
defined
it
could
never
spread
out
thus
and
enter
into
such
a
multitude
of
things
however
it
is
incontestable
that
in
this
case
the
idea
of
an
impersonal
religious
force
is
beginning
to
change
but
there
are
other
cases
where
it
is
affirmed
in
all
its
abstract
purity
and
even
reaches
a
higher
degree
of
generality
than
in
australia
if
the
different
totemic
principles
to
which
the
various
clans
of
a
single
tribe
address
themselves
are
distinct
from
each
other
they
are
none
the
less
comparable
to
each
other
at
bottom
for
all
play
the
same
rôle
in
their
respective
spheres
there
are
societies
which
have
had
the
feeling
of
this
unity
with
nature
and
have
consequently
advanced
to
the
idea
of
a
unique
religious
force
of
which
all
other
sacred
principles
are
only
expressions
and
which
makes
the
unity
of
the
universe
as
these
societies
are
still
thoroughly
impregnated
with
totemism
and
as
they
remain
entangled
in
a
social
organization
identical
with
that
of
the
australians
we
may
say
that
totemism
contained
this
idea
in
potentiality
this
can
be
observed
in
a
large
number
of
american
tribes
especially
those
belonging
to
the
great
sioux
family
the
omaha
ponka
kansas
osage
assiniboin
dakota
iowa
winnebago
mandan
hidatsa
etc
many
of
these
are
still
organized
in
clans
as
the
omaha
and
the
iowa
others
were
so
not
long
since
and
says
dorsey
it
is
still
possible
to
find
among
them
all
the
foundations
of
the
totemic
system
just
as
in
the
other
societies
of
the
sioux
now
among
these
peoples
above
all
the
particular
deities
to
whom
men
render
a
cult
there
is
a
power
to
which
all
the
others
have
the
relation
of
derived
forms
and
which
is
called
owing
to
the
preponderating
place
thus
assigned
to
this
principle
in
the
siouan
pantheon
it
is
sometimes
regarded
as
a
sort
of
sovereign
god
or
a
jupiter
or
jahveh
and
travellers
have
frequently
translated
wakan
by
great
spirit
this
is
misrepresenting
its
real
nature
gravely
the
wakan
is
in
no
way
a
personal
being
the
natives
do
not
represent
it
in
a
determined
form
according
to
an
observer
cited
by
dorsey
they
say
that
they
have
never
seen
the
wakanda
so
they
can
not
pretend
to
personify
it
it
is
not
even
possible
to
define
it
by
determined
attributes
and
characteristics
no
word
says
riggs
can
explain
the
meaning
of
this
term
among
the
dakota
it
embraces
all
mystery
all
secret
power
all
divinity
all
the
beings
which
the
dakota
reveres
the
earth
the
four
winds
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
stars
are
manifestations
of
this
mysterious
life
and
power
which
enters
into
all
sometimes
it
is
represented
in
the
form
of
a
wind
as
a
breath
having
its
seat
in
the
four
cardinal
points
and
moving
everything
sometimes
it
is
a
voice
heard
in
the
crashing
of
the
thunder
the
sun
moon
and
stars
are
wakan
but
no
enumeration
could
exhaust
this
infinitely
complex
idea
it
is
not
a
definite
and
definable
power
the
power
of
doing
this
or
that
it
is
power
in
an
absolute
sense
with
no
epithet
or
determination
of
any
sort
the
various
divine
powers
are
only
particular
manifestations
and
personifications
of
it
each
of
them
is
this
power
seen
under
one
of
its
numerous
aspects
it
is
this
which
made
one
observer
say
he
is
a
protean
god
he
is
supposed
to
appear
to
different
persons
in
different
forms
nor
are
the
gods
the
only
beings
animated
by
it
it
is
the
principle
of
all
that
lives
or
acts
or
moves
all
life
is
wakan
so
also
is
everything
which
exhibits
power
whether
in
action
as
the
winds
and
drifting
clouds
or
in
passive
endurance
as
the
boulder
by
the
wayside
among
the
iroquois
whose
social
organization
has
an
even
more
pronouncedly
totemic
character
this
same
idea
is
found
again
the
word
which
expresses
it
is
the
exact
equivalent
of
the
wakan
of
the
sioux
the
savage
man
says
hewitt
conceived
the
diverse
bodies
collectively
constituting
his
environment
to
possess
inherently
mystic
potence
whether
they
be
the
rocks
the
waters
the
tides
the
plants
and
the
trees
the
animals
and
man
the
wind
and
the
storms
the
clouds
and
the
thunders
and
the
lightnings
etc
this
potence
is
held
to
be
the
property
of
all
things
and
by
the
inchoate
mentation
of
man
is
regarded
as
the
efficient
cause
of
all
phenomena
all
the
activities
of
his
environment
a
sorcerer
or
shaman
has
orenda
but
as
much
would
be
said
of
a
man
succeeding
in
his
enterprises
at
bottom
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
which
does
not
have
its
quota
of
orenda
but
the
quantities
vary
there
are
some
beings
either
men
or
things
which
are
favoured
there
are
others
which
are
relatively
disinherited
and
the
universal
life
consists
in
the
struggles
of
these
orenda
of
unequal
intensity
the
more
intense
conquer
the
weaker
is
one
man
more
successful
than
his
companions
in
the
hunt
or
at
war
it
is
because
he
has
more
orenda
if
an
animal
escapes
from
a
hunter
who
is
pursuing
it
it
is
because
the
orenda
of
the
former
was
the
more
powerful
this
same
idea
is
found
among
the
shoshone
under
the
name
of
among
the
algonquin
under
the
name
of
of
among
the
kwakiutl
of
among
the
tlinkit
and
of
among
the
haida
but
it
is
not
peculiar
to
the
indians
of
north
america
it
is
in
melanesia
that
it
was
studied
for
the
first
time
it
is
true
that
in
certain
of
the
islands
of
melanesia
social
organization
is
no
longer
on
a
totemic
basis
but
in
all
totemism
is
still
visible
in
spite
of
what
codrington
has
said
about
it
now
among
these
peoples
we
find
under
the
name
of
an
idea
which
is
the
exact
equivalent
of
the
wakan
of
the
sioux
and
the
orenda
of
the
iroquois
the
definition
given
by
codrington
is
as
follows
there
is
a
belief
in
a
force
altogether
distinct
from
physical
power
which
acts
in
all
ways
for
good
and
evil
and
which
it
is
of
the
greatest
advantage
to
possess
or
control
this
is
mana
i
think
i
know
what
our
people
mean
by
it
it
is
a
power
or
influence
not
physical
and
in
a
way
supernatural
but
it
shows
itself
in
physical
force
or
in
any
kind
of
power
or
excellence
which
a
man
possesses
this
mana
is
not
fixed
in
anything
and
can
be
conveyed
in
almost
anything
all
melanesian
religion
consists
in
fact
in
getting
this
mana
for
one
self
or
getting
it
used
for
benefit
is
this
not
the
same
notion
of
an
anonymous
and
diffused
force
the
germs
of
which
we
recently
found
in
the
totemism
of
australia
here
is
the
same
impersonality
for
as
codrington
says
we
must
be
careful
not
to
regard
it
as
a
sort
of
supreme
being
any
such
idea
is
absolutely
foreign
to
melanesian
thought
here
is
the
same
ubiquity
the
mana
is
located
nowhere
definitely
and
it
is
everywhere
all
forms
of
life
and
all
the
effects
of
the
action
either
of
men
or
of
living
beings
or
of
simple
minerals
are
attributed
to
its
influence
therefore
there
is
no
undue
temerity
in
attributing
to
the
australians
an
idea
such
as
the
one
we
have
discovered
in
our
analysis
of
totemic
beliefs
for
we
find
it
again
but
abstracted
and
generalized
to
a
higher
degree
at
the
basis
of
other
religions
whose
roots
go
back
into
a
system
like
the
australian
one
and
which
visibly
bear
the
mark
of
this
the
two
conceptions
are
obviously
related
they
differ
only
in
degree
while
the
mana
is
diffused
into
the
whole
universe
what
we
call
the
god
or
to
speak
more
precisely
the
totemic
principle
is
localized
in
the
more
limited
circle
of
the
beings
and
things
of
certain
species
it
is
mana
but
a
little
more
specialized
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
specialization
is
quite
relative
moreover
there
is
one
case
where
this
connection
is
made
especially
apparent
among
the
omaha
there
are
totems
of
all
sorts
both
individual
and
collective
but
both
are
only
particular
forms
of
wakan
the
foundation
of
the
indian
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
the
totem
says
miss
fletcher
rested
upon
his
belief
concerning
nature
and
life
this
conception
was
complex
and
involved
two
prominent
ideas
first
that
all
things
animate
and
inanimate
were
permeated
by
a
common
life
and
second
that
this
life
could
not
be
broken
but
was
continuous
now
this
common
principle
of
life
is
the
wakan
the
totem
is
the
means
by
which
an
individual
is
put
into
relations
with
this
source
of
energy
if
the
totem
has
any
powers
it
is
because
it
incarnates
the
wakan
if
a
man
who
has
violated
the
interdictions
protecting
his
totem
is
struck
by
sickness
or
death
it
is
because
this
mysterious
force
against
which
he
has
thus
set
himself
that
is
the
wakan
reacts
against
him
with
a
force
proportionate
to
the
shock
received
also
just
as
the
totem
is
wakan
so
the
wakan
in
its
turn
sometimes
shows
its
totemic
origin
by
the
way
in
which
it
is
conceived
in
fact
say
says
that
among
the
dakota
the
wahconda
is
manifested
sometimes
in
the
form
of
a
grey
bear
sometimes
of
a
bison
a
beaver
or
some
other
animal
undoubtedly
this
formula
can
not
be
accepted
without
reserve
the
wakan
repels
all
personification
and
consequently
it
is
hardly
probable
that
it
has
ever
been
thought
of
in
its
abstract
generality
with
the
aid
of
such
definite
symbols
but
remark
is
probably
applicable
to
the
particular
forms
which
it
takes
in
specializing
itself
in
the
concrete
reality
of
life
now
if
there
is
a
possibility
that
there
was
a
time
when
these
specializations
of
the
wakan
bore
witness
to
such
an
affinity
for
an
animal
form
that
would
be
one
more
proof
of
the
close
bonds
uniting
this
conception
to
the
totemic
beliefs
it
is
possible
to
explain
why
this
idea
has
been
unable
to
reach
the
same
degree
of
abstraction
in
australia
as
in
the
more
advanced
societies
this
is
not
merely
due
to
the
insufficient
aptitude
of
the
australian
for
abstracting
and
generalizing
before
all
it
is
the
nature
of
the
social
environment
which
has
imposed
this
particularism
in
fact
as
long
as
totemism
remains
at
the
basis
of
the
cultural
organization
the
clan
keeps
an
autonomy
in
the
religious
society
which
though
not
absolute
is
always
very
marked
of
course
we
can
say
that
in
one
sense
each
totemic
group
is
only
a
chapel
of
the
tribal
church
but
it
is
a
chapel
enjoying
a
large
independence
the
cult
celebrated
there
though
not
a
whole
has
only
external
relations
with
the
others
they
interchange
without
intermingling
the
totem
of
the
clan
is
fully
sacred
only
for
this
clan
consequently
the
groups
of
things
attributed
to
each
clan
which
are
a
part
of
it
in
the
same
way
the
men
are
have
the
same
individuality
and
autonomy
each
of
them
is
represented
as
irreducible
into
similar
groups
as
separated
from
them
by
a
break
of
continuity
and
as
constituting
a
distinct
realm
under
these
circumstances
it
would
occur
to
no
one
that
these
heterogeneous
worlds
were
different
manifestations
of
one
and
the
same
fundamental
force
on
the
contrary
one
might
suppose
that
each
of
them
corresponded
to
an
organically
different
mana
whose
action
could
not
extend
beyond
the
clan
and
the
circle
of
things
attributed
to
it
the
idea
of
a
single
and
universal
mana
could
be
born
only
at
the
moment
when
the
tribal
religion
developed
above
that
of
the
clans
and
absorbed
them
more
or
less
completely
it
is
along
with
the
feeling
of
the
tribal
unity
that
the
feeling
of
the
substantial
unity
of
the
world
awakens
as
we
shall
presently
show
it
is
true
that
the
australian
societies
are
already
acquainted
with
a
cult
that
is
common
to
the
tribe
as
a
whole
but
if
this
cult
represents
the
highest
form
of
the
australian
religions
it
has
not
succeeded
in
touching
and
modifying
the
principles
upon
which
they
repose
totemism
is
essentially
a
federative
religion
which
can
not
go
beyond
a
certain
degree
of
centralization
without
ceasing
to
be
itself
one
characteristic
fact
clearly
shows
the
fundamental
reason
which
has
kept
the
idea
of
the
mana
so
specialized
in
australia
the
real
religious
forces
those
thought
of
in
the
form
of
totems
are
not
the
only
ones
with
which
the
australian
feels
himself
obliged
to
reckon
there
are
also
some
over
which
magicians
have
particular
control
while
the
former
are
theoretically
considered
healthful
and
beneficent
the
second
have
it
as
their
especial
function
to
cause
sickness
and
death
and
at
the
same
time
that
they
differ
so
greatly
in
the
nature
of
their
effects
they
are
contrasted
also
by
the
relations
which
they
sustain
with
the
social
organization
a
totem
is
always
a
matter
of
the
clan
but
on
the
contrary
magic
is
a
tribal
and
even
an
intertribal
institution
magic
forces
do
not
belong
to
any
special
portion
of
the
tribe
in
particular
all
that
is
needed
to
make
use
of
them
is
the
possession
of
efficient
recipes
likewise
everybody
is
liable
to
feel
their
effects
and
consequently
should
try
to
protect
himself
against
them
these
are
vague
forces
specially
attached
to
no
determined
social
division
and
even
able
to
spread
their
action
beyond
the
tribe
now
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
among
the
arunta
and
loritja
they
are
conceived
as
simple
aspects
and
particular
forms
of
a
unique
force
called
in
arunta
or
this
is
a
term
say
spencer
and
gillen
of
somewhat
vague
import
but
always
associated
at
bottom
with
the
possession
of
evil
the
name
is
applied
indiscriminately
to
the
evil
influence
or
to
the
object
in
which
it
is
for
the
time
being
or
permanently
resident
by
arúnkulta
says
strehlow
the
native
signifies
a
force
which
suddenly
stops
life
and
brings
death
to
all
who
come
in
contact
with
it
this
name
is
given
to
the
bones
and
pieces
of
wood
from
which
charms
are
derived
and
also
to
poisonous
animals
and
vegetables
so
it
may
accurately
be
called
a
harmful
mana
grey
mentions
an
absolutely
identical
notion
among
the
tribes
he
observed
thus
among
these
different
peoples
while
the
properly
religious
forces
do
not
succeed
in
avoiding
a
certain
heterogeneity
magic
forces
are
thought
of
as
being
all
of
the
same
nature
the
mind
represents
them
in
their
generic
unity
this
is
because
they
rise
above
the
social
organization
and
its
divisions
and
subdivisions
and
move
in
a
homogeneous
and
continuous
space
where
they
meet
with
nothing
to
differentiate
them
the
others
on
the
contrary
being
localized
in
definite
and
distinct
social
forms
are
diversified
and
particularized
in
the
image
of
the
environment
in
which
they
are
situated
from
this
we
can
see
how
thoroughly
the
idea
of
an
impersonal
religious
force
enters
into
the
meaning
and
spirit
of
australian
totemism
for
it
disengages
itself
with
clarity
as
soon
as
no
contrary
cause
opposes
it
it
is
true
that
the
arungquiltha
is
purely
a
magic
force
but
between
religious
forces
and
magic
forces
there
is
no
difference
of
kind
sometimes
they
are
even
designated
by
the
same
name
in
melanesia
the
magicians
and
charms
have
mana
just
like
the
agents
and
rites
of
the
regular
cult
the
word
oranda
is
employed
in
the
same
way
by
the
iroquois
so
we
can
legitimately
infer
the
nature
of
the
one
from
that
of
the
other
iii
the
results
to
which
the
above
analysis
has
led
us
do
not
concern
the
history
of
totemism
only
but
also
the
genesis
of
religious
thought
in
general
under
the
pretext
that
in
early
times
men
were
dominated
by
their
senses
and
the
representations
of
their
senses
it
has
frequently
been
held
that
they
commenced
by
representing
the
divine
in
the
concrete
form
of
definite
and
personal
beings
the
facts
do
not
confirm
this
presumption
we
have
just
described
a
systematically
united
scheme
of
religious
beliefs
which
we
have
good
reason
to
regard
as
very
primitive
yet
we
have
met
with
no
personalities
of
this
sort
the
real
totemic
cult
is
addressed
neither
to
certain
determined
animals
nor
to
certain
vegetables
nor
even
to
an
animal
or
vegetable
species
but
to
a
vague
power
spread
through
these
things
even
in
the
most
advanced
religions
which
have
developed
out
of
totemism
such
as
those
which
we
find
among
the
north
american
indians
this
idea
instead
of
being
effaced
becomes
more
conscious
of
itself
it
is
declared
with
a
clarity
it
did
not
have
before
while
at
the
same
time
it
attains
a
higher
generality
it
is
this
which
dominates
the
entire
religious
system
this
is
the
original
matter
out
of
which
have
been
constructed
those
beings
of
every
sort
which
the
religions
of
all
times
have
consecrated
and
adored
the
spirits
demons
genii
and
gods
of
every
sort
are
only
the
concrete
forms
taken
by
this
energy
or
potentiality
as
hewitt
calls
it
in
individualizing
itself
in
fixing
itself
upon
a
certain
determined
object
or
point
in
space
or
in
centring
around
an
ideal
and
legendary
being
though
one
conceived
as
real
by
the
popular
imagination
a
dakota
questioned
by
miss
fletcher
expressed
this
essential
consubstantiability
of
all
sacred
things
in
language
that
is
full
of
relief
every
thing
as
it
moves
now
and
then
here
and
there
makes
stops
the
bird
as
it
flies
stops
in
one
place
to
make
its
nest
and
in
another
to
rest
in
its
flight
a
man
when
he
goes
forth
stops
when
he
wills
so
the
god
has
stopped
the
sun
which
is
so
bright
and
beautiful
is
one
place
where
he
has
stopped
the
trees
the
animals
are
where
he
has
stopped
and
the
indian
thinks
of
these
places
and
sends
his
prayers
to
reach
the
place
where
the
god
has
stopped
and
to
win
help
and
a
blessing
in
other
words
the
wakan
for
this
is
what
he
was
talking
about
comes
and
goes
through
the
world
and
sacred
things
are
the
points
upon
which
it
alights
here
we
are
for
once
just
as
far
from
naturism
as
from
animism
if
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
stars
have
been
adored
they
have
not
owed
this
honour
to
their
intrinsic
nature
or
their
distinctive
properties
but
to
the
fact
that
they
are
thought
to
participate
in
this
force
which
alone
is
able
to
give
things
a
sacred
character
and
which
is
also
found
in
a
multitude
of
other
beings
even
the
smallest
if
the
souls
of
the
dead
have
been
the
object
of
rites
it
is
not
because
they
are
believed
to
be
made
out
of
some
fluid
and
impalpable
substance
nor
is
it
because
they
resemble
the
shadow
cast
by
a
body
or
its
reflection
on
a
surface
of
water
lightness
and
fluidity
are
not
enough
to
confer
sanctity
they
have
been
invested
with
this
dignity
only
in
so
far
as
they
contained
within
them
something
of
this
same
force
the
source
of
all
religiosity
we
are
now
in
a
better
condition
to
understand
why
it
has
been
impossible
to
define
religion
by
the
idea
of
mythical
personalities
gods
or
spirits
it
is
because
this
way
of
representing
religious
things
is
in
no
way
inherent
in
their
nature
what
we
find
at
the
origin
and
basis
of
religious
thought
are
not
determined
and
distinct
objects
and
beings
possessing
a
sacred
character
of
themselves
they
are
indefinite
powers
anonymous
forces
more
or
less
numerous
in
different
societies
and
sometimes
even
reduced
to
a
unity
and
whose
impersonality
is
strictly
comparable
to
that
of
the
physical
forces
whose
manifestations
the
sciences
of
nature
study
as
for
particular
sacred
things
they
are
only
individualized
forms
of
this
essential
principle
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
even
in
the
religions
where
there
are
avowed
divinities
there
are
rites
having
an
efficient
virtue
in
themselves
independently
of
all
divine
intervention
it
is
because
this
force
may
be
attached
to
words
that
are
pronounced
or
movements
that
are
made
just
as
well
as
to
corporal
substances
the
voice
or
the
movements
may
serve
as
its
vehicle
and
it
may
produce
its
effects
through
their
intermediacy
without
the
aid
of
any
god
or
spirit
even
should
it
happen
to
concentrate
itself
especially
in
a
rite
this
will
become
a
creator
of
divinities
from
that
very
fact
this
is
why
there
is
scarcely
a
divine
personality
who
does
not
retain
some
impersonality
those
who
represent
it
most
clearly
in
a
concrete
and
visible
form
think
of
it
at
the
same
time
as
an
abstract
power
which
can
not
be
defined
except
by
its
own
efficacy
or
as
a
force
spread
out
in
space
and
which
is
contained
at
least
in
part
in
each
of
its
effects
it
is
the
power
of
producing
rain
or
wind
crops
or
the
light
of
day
zeus
is
in
each
of
the
raindrops
which
falls
just
as
ceres
is
in
each
of
the
sheaves
of
the
harvest
as
a
general
rule
in
fact
this
efficacy
is
so
imperfectly
determined
that
the
believer
is
able
to
form
only
a
very
vague
notion
of
it
moreover
it
is
this
indecision
which
has
made
possible
these
syncretisms
and
duplications
in
the
course
of
which
gods
are
broken
up
dismembered
and
confused
in
every
way
perhaps
there
is
not
a
single
religion
in
which
the
original
mana
whether
unique
or
multiform
has
been
resolved
entirely
into
a
clearly
defined
number
of
beings
who
are
distinct
and
separate
from
each
other
each
of
them
always
retains
a
touch
of
impersonality
as
it
were
which
enables
it
to
enter
into
new
combinations
not
as
the
result
of
a
simple
survival
but
because
it
is
the
nature
of
religious
forces
to
be
unable
to
individualize
themselves
completely
this
conception
to
which
we
have
been
led
by
the
study
of
totemism
alone
has
the
additional
recommendation
that
many
scholars
have
recently
adopted
it
quite
independently
of
one
another
as
a
conclusion
from
very
different
sorts
of
studies
there
is
a
tendency
towards
a
spontaneous
agreement
on
this
point
which
should
be
remarked
for
it
is
a
presumption
of
objectivity
as
early
as
we
pointed
out
the
impossibility
of
making
the
idea
of
a
mythical
personality
enter
into
the
definition
of
religious
phenomena
in
marrett
showed
the
existence
of
a
religious
phase
which
he
called
in
which
the
rites
are
addressed
to
impersonal
forces
like
the
melanesian
mana
and
the
wakan
of
the
omaha
and
dakota
however
marrett
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
always
and
in
every
case
the
idea
of
a
spirit
is
logically
and
chronologically
posterior
to
that
of
mana
and
is
derived
from
it
he
even
seemed
disposed
to
admit
that
it
has
sometimes
appeared
independently
and
consequently
that
religious
thought
flows
from
a
double
source
on
the
other
hand
he
conceived
the
mana
as
an
inherent
property
of
things
as
an
element
of
their
appearance
for
according
to
him
this
is
simply
the
character
which
we
attribute
to
everything
out
of
the
ordinary
and
which
inspires
a
sentiment
of
fear
or
admiration
this
practically
amounts
to
a
return
to
the
naturist
theory
a
little
later
mm
hubert
and
mauss
while
attempting
to
formulate
a
general
theory
of
magic
established
the
fact
that
magic
as
a
whole
reposes
on
the
notion
of
mana
the
close
kinship
of
the
magic
rite
and
the
religious
rite
being
known
it
was
even
possible
to
foresee
that
the
same
theory
should
be
applied
to
religion
this
was
sustained
by
preuss
in
a
series
of
articles
in
the
that
same
year
relying
chiefly
upon
facts
taken
from
american
civilizations
preuss
set
out
to
prove
that
the
ideas
of
the
soul
and
spirit
were
not
developed
until
after
those
of
power
and
impersonal
force
that
the
former
are
only
a
transformation
of
the
latter
and
that
up
to
a
relatively
late
date
they
retain
the
marks
of
their
original
impersonality
in
fact
he
shows
that
even
in
the
advanced
religions
they
are
represented
in
the
form
of
vague
emanations
disengaging
themselves
automatically
from
the
things
in
which
they
reside
and
even
tending
to
escape
by
all
the
ways
that
are
open
to
them
the
mouth
the
nose
and
all
the
other
openings
of
the
body
the
breath
the
look
the
word
etc
at
the
same
time
preuss
pointed
out
their
protean
forms
and
their
extreme
plasticity
which
permits
them
to
give
themselves
successively
and
almost
concurrently
to
the
most
varied
uses
it
is
true
that
if
we
stick
to
the
letter
of
the
terminology
employed
by
this
author
we
may
believe
that
for
him
the
forces
have
a
magic
not
a
religious
nature
he
calls
them
charms
but
it
is
evident
that
in
expressing
himself
thus
he
does
not
intend
to
put
them
outside
of
religion
for
it
is
in
the
essentially
religious
rites
that
he
shows
their
action
for
example
in
the
great
mexican
ceremonies
if
he
uses
these
expressions
it
is
undoubtedly
because
he
knows
no
others
which
mark
better
the
impersonality
of
these
forces
and
the
sort
of
mechanism
with
which
they
operate
thus
this
same
idea
tends
to
come
to
light
on
every
side
the
impression
becomes
more
and
more
prevalent
that
even
the
most
elementary
mythological
constructions
are
secondary
products
which
cover
over
a
system
of
beliefs
at
once
simpler
and
more
obscure
vaguer
and
more
essential
which
form
the
solid
foundations
upon
which
the
religious
systems
are
built
it
is
this
primitive
foundation
which
our
analysis
of
totemism
has
enabled
us
to
reach
the
various
writers
whose
studies
we
have
just
mentioned
arrived
at
this
conclusion
only
through
facts
taken
from
very
diverse
religions
some
of
which
even
correspond
to
a
civilization
that
is
already
far
advanced
such
is
the
case
for
example
with
the
mexican
religions
of
which
preuss
makes
great
use
so
it
might
be
asked
if
this
theory
is
equally
applicable
to
the
most
simple
religions
but
since
it
is
impossible
to
go
lower
than
totemism
we
are
not
exposed
to
this
risk
of
error
and
at
the
same
time
we
have
an
opportunity
of
finding
the
initial
notion
from
which
the
ideas
of
wakan
and
mana
are
derived
this
is
the
notion
of
the
totemic
principle
iv
but
this
notion
is
not
only
of
primary
importance
because
of
the
rôle
it
has
played
in
the
development
of
religious
ideas
it
also
has
a
lay
aspect
in
which
it
is
of
interest
for
the
history
of
scientific
thought
it
is
the
first
form
of
the
idea
of
force
in
fact
the
wakan
plays
the
same
rôle
in
the
world
as
the
sioux
conceives
it
as
the
one
played
by
the
forces
with
which
science
explains
the
diverse
phenomena
of
nature
this
however
does
not
mean
that
it
is
thought
of
as
an
exclusively
physical
energy
on
the
contrary
in
the
next
chapter
we
shall
see
that
the
elements
going
to
make
up
this
idea
are
taken
from
the
most
diverse
realms
but
this
very
compositeness
of
its
nature
enables
it
to
be
utilized
as
a
universal
principle
of
explanation
it
is
from
it
that
all
life
comes
all
life
is
wakan
and
by
this
word
life
we
must
understand
everything
that
acts
and
reacts
that
moves
and
is
moved
in
both
the
mineral
and
biological
kingdoms
the
wakan
is
the
cause
of
all
the
movements
which
take
place
in
the
universe
we
have
even
seen
that
the
orenda
of
the
iroquois
is
the
efficient
cause
of
all
the
phenomena
and
all
the
activities
which
are
manifested
around
men
it
is
a
power
inherent
in
all
bodies
and
all
things
it
is
the
orenda
which
makes
the
wind
blow
the
sun
lighten
and
heat
the
earth
or
animals
reproduce
and
which
makes
men
strong
clever
and
intelligent
when
the
iroquois
says
that
the
life
of
all
nature
is
the
product
of
the
conflicts
aroused
between
the
unequally
intense
orenda
of
the
different
beings
he
only
expresses
in
his
own
language
this
modern
idea
that
the
world
is
a
system
of
forces
limiting
and
containing
each
other
and
making
an
equilibrium
the
melanesian
attributes
this
same
general
efficacy
to
his
mana
it
is
owing
to
his
mana
that
a
man
succeeds
in
hunting
or
fighting
that
gardens
give
a
good
return
or
that
flocks
prosper
if
an
arrow
strikes
its
mark
it
is
because
it
is
charged
with
mana
it
is
the
same
cause
which
makes
a
net
catch
fish
well
or
a
canoe
ride
well
on
the
sea
etc
it
is
true
that
if
certain
phrases
of
codrington
are
taken
literally
mana
should
be
the
cause
to
which
is
attributed
everything
which
is
beyond
the
ordinary
power
of
men
outside
the
common
processes
of
nature
but
from
the
very
examples
which
he
cites
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
sphere
of
the
mana
is
really
much
more
extended
in
reality
it
serves
to
explain
usual
and
everyday
phenomena
there
is
nothing
superhuman
or
supernatural
in
the
fact
that
a
ship
sails
or
a
hunter
catches
game
etc
however
among
these
events
of
daily
life
there
are
some
so
insignificant
and
familiar
that
they
pass
unperceived
they
are
not
noticed
and
consequently
no
need
is
felt
of
explaining
them
the
concept
of
mana
is
applied
only
to
those
that
are
important
enough
to
cause
reflection
and
to
awaken
a
minimum
of
interest
and
curiosity
but
they
are
not
marvellous
for
all
that
and
what
is
true
of
the
mana
as
well
as
the
orenda
and
wakan
may
be
said
equally
well
of
the
totemic
principle
it
is
through
this
that
the
life
of
the
men
of
the
clan
and
the
animals
or
plants
of
the
totemic
species
as
well
as
all
the
things
which
are
classified
under
the
totem
and
partake
of
its
nature
is
manifested
so
the
idea
of
force
is
of
religious
origin
it
is
from
religion
that
it
has
been
borrowed
first
by
philosophy
then
by
the
sciences
this
has
already
been
foreseen
by
comte
and
this
is
why
he
made
metaphysics
the
heir
of
theology
but
he
concluded
from
this
that
the
idea
of
force
is
destined
to
disappear
from
science
for
owing
to
its
mystic
origins
he
refused
it
all
objective
value
but
we
are
going
to
show
that
on
the
contrary
religious
forces
are
real
howsoever
imperfect
the
symbols
may
be
by
the
aid
of
which
they
are
thought
of
from
this
it
will
follow
that
the
same
is
true
of
the
concept
of
force
in
general
chapter
vii
origins
of
these
beliefs
of
the
idea
of
the
totemic
principle
or
the
proposition
established
in
the
preceding
chapter
determines
the
terms
in
which
the
problem
of
the
origins
of
totemism
should
be
posed
since
totemism
is
everywhere
dominated
by
the
idea
of
a
principle
imminent
in
certain
categories
of
men
and
things
and
thought
of
under
the
form
of
an
animal
or
vegetable
the
explanation
of
this
religion
is
essentially
the
explanation
of
this
belief
to
arrive
at
this
we
must
seek
to
learn
how
men
have
been
led
to
construct
this
idea
and
out
of
what
materials
they
have
constructed
it
i
it
is
obviously
not
out
of
the
sensations
which
the
things
serving
as
totems
are
able
to
arouse
in
the
mind
we
have
shown
that
these
things
are
frequently
insignificant
the
lizard
the
caterpillar
the
rat
the
ant
the
frog
the
turkey
the
the
the
cockatoo
to
cite
only
those
names
which
appear
frequently
in
the
lists
of
australian
totems
are
not
of
a
nature
to
produce
upon
men
these
great
and
strong
impressions
which
in
a
way
resemble
religious
emotions
and
which
impress
a
sacred
character
upon
the
objects
they
create
it
is
true
that
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
stars
and
the
great
atmospheric
phenomena
which
have
on
the
contrary
all
that
is
necessary
to
strike
the
imagination
forcibly
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
serve
only
very
exceptionally
as
totems
it
is
even
probable
that
they
were
very
slow
in
taking
this
office
so
it
is
not
the
intrinsic
nature
of
the
thing
whose
name
the
clan
bears
that
marked
it
out
to
become
the
object
of
a
cult
also
if
the
sentiments
which
it
inspired
were
really
the
determining
cause
of
the
totemic
rites
and
beliefs
it
would
be
the
sacred
thing
the
animals
or
plants
employed
as
totems
would
play
an
eminent
part
in
the
religious
life
but
we
know
that
the
centre
of
the
cult
is
actually
elsewhere
it
is
the
figurative
representations
of
this
plant
or
animal
and
the
totemic
emblems
and
symbols
of
every
sort
which
have
the
greatest
sanctity
so
it
is
in
them
that
is
found
the
source
of
that
religious
nature
of
which
the
real
objects
represented
by
these
emblems
receive
only
a
reflection
thus
the
totem
is
before
all
a
symbol
a
material
expression
of
something
else
but
of
what
from
the
analysis
to
which
we
have
been
giving
our
attention
it
is
evident
that
it
expresses
and
symbolizes
two
different
sorts
of
things
in
the
first
place
it
is
the
outward
and
visible
form
of
what
we
have
called
the
totemic
principle
or
god
but
it
is
also
the
symbol
of
the
determined
society
called
the
clan
it
is
its
flag
it
is
the
sign
by
which
each
clan
distinguishes
itself
from
the
others
the
visible
mark
of
its
personality
a
mark
borne
by
everything
which
is
a
part
of
the
clan
under
any
title
whatsoever
men
beasts
or
things
so
if
it
is
at
once
the
symbol
of
the
god
and
of
the
society
is
that
not
because
the
god
and
the
society
are
only
one
how
could
the
emblem
of
the
group
have
been
able
to
become
the
figure
of
this
if
the
group
and
the
divinity
were
two
distinct
realities
the
god
of
the
clan
the
totemic
principle
can
therefore
be
nothing
else
than
the
clan
itself
personified
and
represented
to
the
imagination
under
the
visible
form
of
the
animal
or
vegetable
which
serves
as
totem
but
how
has
this
apotheosis
been
possible
and
how
did
it
happen
to
take
place
in
this
fashion
ii
in
a
general
way
it
is
unquestionable
that
a
society
has
all
that
is
necessary
to
arouse
the
sensation
of
the
divine
in
minds
merely
by
the
power
that
it
has
over
them
for
to
its
members
it
is
what
a
god
is
to
his
worshippers
in
fact
a
god
is
first
of
all
a
being
whom
men
think
of
as
superior
to
themselves
and
upon
whom
they
feel
that
they
depend
whether
it
be
a
conscious
personality
such
as
zeus
or
jahveh
or
merely
abstract
forces
such
as
those
in
play
in
totemism
the
worshipper
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
believes
himself
held
to
certain
manners
of
acting
which
are
imposed
upon
him
by
the
nature
of
the
sacred
principle
with
which
he
feels
that
he
is
in
communion
now
society
also
gives
us
the
sensation
of
a
perpetual
dependence
since
it
has
a
nature
which
is
peculiar
to
itself
and
different
from
our
individual
nature
it
pursues
ends
which
are
likewise
special
to
it
but
as
it
can
not
attain
them
except
through
our
intermediacy
it
imperiously
demands
our
aid
it
requires
that
forgetful
of
our
own
interests
we
make
ourselves
its
servitors
and
it
submits
us
to
every
sort
of
inconvenience
privation
and
sacrifice
without
which
social
life
would
be
impossible
it
is
because
of
this
that
at
every
instant
we
are
obliged
to
submit
ourselves
to
rules
of
conduct
and
of
thought
which
we
have
neither
made
nor
desired
and
which
are
sometimes
even
contrary
to
our
most
fundamental
inclinations
and
instincts
even
if
society
were
unable
to
obtain
these
concessions
and
sacrifices
from
us
except
by
a
material
constraint
it
might
awaken
in
us
only
the
idea
of
a
physical
force
to
which
we
must
give
way
of
necessity
instead
of
that
of
a
moral
power
such
as
religions
adore
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
empire
which
it
holds
over
consciences
is
due
much
less
to
the
physical
supremacy
of
which
it
has
the
privilege
than
to
the
moral
authority
with
which
it
is
invested
if
we
yield
to
its
orders
it
is
not
merely
because
it
is
strong
enough
to
triumph
over
our
resistance
it
is
primarily
because
it
is
the
object
of
a
venerable
respect
we
say
that
an
object
whether
individual
or
collective
inspires
respect
when
the
representation
expressing
it
in
the
mind
is
gifted
with
such
a
force
that
it
automatically
causes
or
inhibits
actions
regard
for
any
consideration
relative
to
their
useful
or
injurious
when
we
obey
somebody
because
of
the
moral
authority
which
we
recognize
in
him
we
follow
out
his
opinions
not
because
they
seem
wise
but
because
a
certain
sort
of
physical
energy
is
imminent
in
the
idea
that
we
form
of
this
person
which
conquers
our
will
and
inclines
it
in
the
indicated
direction
respect
is
the
emotion
which
we
experience
when
we
feel
this
interior
and
wholly
spiritual
pressure
operating
upon
us
then
we
are
not
determined
by
the
advantages
or
inconveniences
of
the
attitude
which
is
prescribed
or
recommended
to
us
it
is
by
the
way
in
which
we
represent
to
ourselves
the
person
recommending
or
prescribing
it
this
is
why
commands
generally
take
a
short
peremptory
form
leaving
no
place
for
hesitation
it
is
because
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
command
and
goes
by
its
own
force
it
excludes
all
idea
of
deliberation
or
calculation
it
gets
its
efficacy
from
the
intensity
of
the
mental
state
in
which
it
is
placed
it
is
this
intensity
which
creates
what
is
called
a
moral
ascendancy
now
the
ways
of
action
to
which
society
is
strongly
enough
attached
to
impose
them
upon
its
members
are
by
that
very
fact
marked
with
a
distinctive
sign
provocative
of
respect
since
they
are
elaborated
in
common
the
vigour
with
which
they
have
been
thought
of
by
each
particular
mind
is
retained
in
all
the
other
minds
and
reciprocally
the
representations
which
express
them
within
each
of
us
have
an
intensity
which
no
purely
private
states
of
consciousness
could
ever
attain
for
they
have
the
strength
of
the
innumerable
individual
representations
which
have
served
to
form
each
of
them
it
is
society
who
speaks
through
the
mouths
of
those
who
affirm
them
in
our
presence
it
is
society
whom
we
hear
in
hearing
them
and
the
voice
of
all
has
an
accent
which
that
of
one
alone
could
never
have
the
very
violence
with
which
society
reacts
by
way
of
blame
or
material
suppression
against
every
attempted
dissidence
contributes
to
strengthening
its
empire
by
manifesting
the
common
conviction
through
this
burst
of
ardour
in
a
word
when
something
is
the
object
of
such
a
state
of
opinion
the
representation
which
each
individual
has
of
it
gains
a
power
of
action
from
its
origins
and
the
conditions
in
which
it
was
born
which
even
those
feel
who
do
not
submit
themselves
to
it
it
tends
to
repel
the
representations
which
contradict
it
and
it
keeps
them
at
a
distance
on
the
other
hand
it
commands
those
acts
which
will
realize
it
and
it
does
so
not
by
a
material
coercion
or
by
the
perspective
of
something
of
this
sort
but
by
the
simple
radiation
of
the
mental
energy
which
it
contains
it
has
an
efficacy
coming
solely
from
its
psychical
properties
and
it
is
by
just
this
sign
that
moral
authority
is
recognized
so
opinion
primarily
a
social
thing
is
a
source
of
authority
and
it
might
even
be
asked
whether
all
authority
is
not
the
daughter
of
opinion
it
may
be
objected
that
science
is
often
the
antagonist
of
opinion
whose
errors
it
combats
and
rectifies
but
it
can
not
succeed
in
this
task
if
it
does
not
have
sufficient
authority
and
it
can
obtain
this
authority
only
from
opinion
itself
if
a
people
did
not
have
faith
in
science
all
the
scientific
demonstrations
in
the
world
would
be
without
any
influence
whatsoever
over
their
minds
even
if
science
happened
to
resist
a
very
strong
current
of
public
opinion
it
would
risk
losing
its
credit
there
since
it
is
in
spiritual
ways
that
social
pressure
exercises
itself
it
could
not
fail
to
give
men
the
idea
that
outside
themselves
there
exist
one
or
several
powers
both
moral
and
at
the
same
time
efficacious
upon
which
they
depend
they
must
think
of
these
powers
at
least
in
part
as
outside
themselves
for
these
address
them
in
a
tone
of
command
and
sometimes
even
order
them
to
do
violence
to
their
most
natural
inclinations
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
if
they
were
able
to
see
that
these
influences
which
they
feel
emanate
from
society
then
the
mythological
system
of
interpretations
would
never
be
born
but
social
action
follows
ways
that
are
too
circuitous
and
obscure
and
employs
psychical
mechanisms
that
are
too
complex
to
allow
the
ordinary
observer
to
see
whence
it
comes
as
long
as
scientific
analysis
does
not
come
to
teach
it
to
them
men
know
well
that
they
are
acted
upon
but
they
do
not
know
by
whom
so
they
must
invent
by
themselves
the
idea
of
these
powers
with
which
they
feel
themselves
in
connection
and
from
that
we
are
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
way
by
which
they
were
led
to
represent
them
under
forms
that
are
really
foreign
to
their
nature
and
to
transfigure
them
by
thought
but
a
god
is
not
merely
an
authority
upon
whom
we
depend
it
is
a
force
upon
which
our
strength
relies
the
man
who
has
obeyed
his
god
and
who
for
this
reason
believes
the
god
is
with
him
approaches
the
world
with
confidence
and
with
the
feeling
of
an
increased
energy
likewise
social
action
does
not
confine
itself
to
demanding
sacrifices
privations
and
efforts
from
us
for
the
collective
force
is
not
entirely
outside
of
us
it
does
not
act
upon
us
wholly
from
without
but
rather
since
society
can
not
exist
except
in
and
through
individual
consciousnesses
this
force
must
also
penetrate
us
and
organize
itself
within
us
it
thus
becomes
an
integral
part
of
our
being
and
by
that
very
fact
this
is
elevated
and
magnified
there
are
occasions
when
this
strengthening
and
vivifying
action
of
society
is
especially
apparent
in
the
midst
of
an
assembly
animated
by
a
common
passion
we
become
susceptible
of
acts
and
sentiments
of
which
we
are
incapable
when
reduced
to
our
own
forces
and
when
the
assembly
is
dissolved
and
when
finding
ourselves
alone
again
we
fall
back
to
our
ordinary
level
we
are
then
able
to
measure
the
height
to
which
we
have
been
raised
above
ourselves
history
abounds
in
examples
of
this
sort
it
is
enough
to
think
of
the
night
of
the
fourth
of
august
when
an
assembly
was
suddenly
led
to
an
act
of
sacrifice
and
abnegation
which
each
of
its
members
had
refused
the
day
before
and
at
which
they
were
all
surprised
the
day
after
this
is
why
all
parties
political
economic
or
confessional
are
careful
to
have
periodical
reunions
where
their
members
may
revivify
their
common
faith
by
manifesting
it
in
common
to
strengthen
those
sentiments
which
if
left
to
themselves
would
soon
weaken
it
is
sufficient
to
bring
those
who
hold
them
together
and
to
put
them
into
closer
and
more
active
relations
with
one
another
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
particular
attitude
of
a
man
speaking
to
a
crowd
at
least
if
he
has
succeeded
in
entering
into
communion
with
it
his
language
has
a
grandiloquence
that
would
be
ridiculous
in
ordinary
circumstances
his
gestures
show
a
certain
domination
his
very
thought
is
impatient
of
all
rules
and
easily
falls
into
all
sorts
of
excesses
it
is
because
he
feels
within
him
an
abnormal
of
force
which
overflows
and
tries
to
burst
out
from
him
sometimes
he
even
has
the
feeling
that
he
is
dominated
by
a
moral
force
which
is
greater
than
he
and
of
which
he
is
only
the
interpreter
it
is
by
this
trait
that
we
are
able
to
recognize
what
has
often
been
called
the
demon
of
oratorical
inspiration
now
this
exceptional
increase
of
force
is
something
very
real
it
comes
to
him
from
the
very
group
which
he
addresses
the
sentiments
provoked
by
his
words
come
back
to
him
but
enlarged
and
amplified
and
to
this
degree
they
strengthen
his
own
sentiment
the
passionate
energies
he
arouses
within
him
and
quicken
his
vital
tone
it
is
no
longer
a
simple
individual
who
speaks
it
is
a
group
incarnate
and
personified
beside
these
passing
and
intermittent
states
there
are
other
more
durable
ones
where
this
strengthening
influence
of
society
makes
itself
felt
with
greater
consequences
and
frequently
even
with
greater
brilliancy
there
are
periods
in
history
when
under
the
influence
of
some
great
collective
shock
social
interactions
have
become
much
more
frequent
and
active
men
look
for
each
other
and
assemble
together
more
than
ever
that
general
effervescence
results
which
is
characteristic
of
revolutionary
or
creative
epochs
now
this
greater
activity
results
in
a
general
stimulation
of
individual
forces
men
see
more
and
differently
now
than
in
normal
times
changes
are
not
merely
of
shades
and
degrees
men
become
different
the
passions
moving
them
are
of
such
an
intensity
that
they
can
not
be
satisfied
except
by
violent
and
unrestrained
actions
actions
of
superhuman
heroism
or
of
bloody
barbarism
this
is
what
explains
the
crusades
for
example
or
many
of
the
scenes
either
sublime
or
savage
of
the
french
revolution
under
the
influence
of
the
general
exaltation
we
see
the
most
mediocre
and
inoffensive
bourgeois
become
either
a
hero
or
a
butcher
and
so
clearly
are
all
these
mental
processes
the
ones
that
are
also
at
the
root
of
religion
that
the
individuals
themselves
have
often
pictured
the
pressure
before
which
they
thus
gave
way
in
a
distinctly
religious
form
the
crusaders
believed
that
they
felt
god
present
in
the
midst
of
them
enjoining
them
to
go
to
the
conquest
of
the
holy
land
joan
of
arc
believed
that
she
obeyed
celestial
voices
but
it
is
not
only
in
exceptional
circumstances
that
this
stimulating
action
of
society
makes
itself
felt
there
is
not
so
to
speak
a
moment
in
our
lives
when
some
current
of
energy
does
not
come
to
us
from
without
the
man
who
has
done
his
duty
finds
in
the
manifestations
of
every
sort
expressing
the
sympathy
esteem
or
affection
which
his
fellows
have
for
him
a
feeling
of
comfort
of
which
he
does
not
ordinarily
take
account
but
which
sustains
him
none
the
less
the
sentiments
which
society
has
for
him
raise
the
sentiments
which
he
has
for
himself
because
he
is
in
moral
harmony
with
his
comrades
he
has
more
confidence
courage
and
boldness
in
action
just
like
the
believer
who
thinks
that
he
feels
the
regard
of
his
god
turned
graciously
towards
him
it
thus
produces
as
it
were
a
perpetual
sustenance
for
our
moral
nature
since
this
varies
with
a
multitude
of
external
circumstances
as
our
relations
with
the
groups
about
us
are
more
or
less
active
and
as
these
groups
themselves
vary
we
can
not
fail
to
feel
that
this
moral
support
depends
upon
an
external
cause
but
we
do
not
perceive
where
this
cause
is
nor
what
it
is
so
we
ordinarily
think
of
it
under
the
form
of
a
moral
power
which
though
immanent
in
us
represents
within
us
something
not
ourselves
this
is
the
moral
conscience
of
which
by
the
way
men
have
never
made
even
a
slightly
distinct
representation
except
by
the
aid
of
religious
symbols
in
addition
to
these
free
forces
which
are
constantly
coming
to
renew
our
own
there
are
others
which
are
fixed
in
the
methods
and
traditions
which
we
employ
we
speak
a
language
that
we
did
not
make
we
use
instruments
that
we
did
not
invent
we
invoke
rights
that
we
did
not
found
a
treasury
of
knowledge
is
transmitted
to
each
generation
that
it
did
not
gather
itself
etc
it
is
to
society
that
we
owe
these
varied
benefits
of
civilization
and
if
we
do
not
ordinarily
see
the
source
from
which
we
get
them
we
at
least
know
that
they
are
not
our
own
work
now
it
is
these
things
that
give
man
his
own
place
among
things
a
man
is
a
man
only
because
he
is
civilized
so
he
could
not
escape
the
feeling
that
outside
of
him
there
are
active
causes
from
which
he
gets
the
characteristic
attributes
of
his
nature
and
which
as
benevolent
powers
assist
him
protect
him
and
assure
him
of
a
privileged
fate
and
of
course
he
must
attribute
to
these
powers
a
dignity
corresponding
to
the
great
value
of
the
good
things
he
attributes
to
them
thus
the
environment
in
which
we
live
seems
to
us
to
be
peopled
with
forces
that
are
at
once
imperious
and
helpful
august
and
gracious
and
with
which
we
have
relations
since
they
exercise
over
us
a
pressure
of
which
we
are
conscious
we
are
forced
to
localize
them
outside
ourselves
just
as
we
do
for
the
objective
causes
of
our
sensations
but
the
sentiments
which
they
inspire
in
us
differ
in
nature
from
those
which
we
have
for
simple
visible
objects
as
long
as
these
latter
are
reduced
to
their
empirical
characteristics
as
shown
in
ordinary
experience
and
as
long
as
the
religious
imagination
has
not
metamorphosed
them
we
entertain
for
them
no
feeling
which
resembles
respect
and
they
contain
within
them
nothing
that
is
able
to
raise
us
outside
ourselves
therefore
the
representations
which
express
them
appear
to
us
to
be
very
different
from
those
aroused
in
us
by
collective
influences
the
two
form
two
distinct
and
separate
mental
states
in
our
consciousness
just
as
do
the
two
forms
of
life
to
which
they
correspond
consequently
we
get
the
impression
that
we
are
in
relations
with
two
distinct
sorts
of
reality
and
that
a
sharply
drawn
line
of
demarcation
separates
them
from
each
other
on
the
one
hand
is
the
world
of
profane
things
on
the
other
that
of
sacred
things
also
in
the
present
day
just
as
much
as
in
the
past
we
see
society
constantly
creating
sacred
things
out
of
ordinary
ones
if
it
happens
to
fall
in
love
with
a
man
and
if
it
thinks
it
has
found
in
him
the
principal
aspirations
that
move
it
as
well
as
the
means
of
satisfying
them
this
man
will
be
raised
above
the
others
and
as
it
were
deified
opinion
will
invest
him
with
a
majesty
exactly
analogous
to
that
protecting
the
gods
this
is
what
has
happened
to
so
many
sovereigns
in
whom
their
age
had
faith
if
they
were
not
made
gods
they
were
at
least
regarded
as
direct
representatives
of
the
deity
and
the
fact
that
it
is
society
alone
which
is
the
author
of
these
varieties
of
apotheosis
is
evident
since
it
frequently
chances
to
consecrate
men
thus
who
have
no
right
to
it
from
their
own
merit
the
simple
deference
inspired
by
men
invested
with
high
social
functions
is
not
different
in
nature
from
religious
respect
it
is
expressed
by
the
same
movements
a
man
keeps
at
a
distance
from
a
high
personage
he
approaches
him
only
with
precautions
in
conversing
with
him
he
uses
other
gestures
and
language
than
those
used
with
ordinary
mortals
the
sentiment
felt
on
these
occasions
is
so
closely
related
to
the
religious
sentiment
that
many
peoples
have
confounded
the
two
in
order
to
explain
the
consideration
accorded
to
princes
nobles
and
political
chiefs
a
sacred
character
has
been
attributed
to
them
in
melanesia
and
polynesia
for
example
it
is
said
that
an
influential
man
has
and
that
his
influence
is
due
to
this
however
it
is
evident
that
his
situation
is
due
solely
to
the
importance
attributed
to
him
by
public
opinion
thus
the
moral
power
conferred
by
opinion
and
that
with
which
sacred
beings
are
invested
are
at
bottom
of
a
single
origin
and
made
up
of
the
same
elements
that
is
why
a
single
word
is
able
to
designate
the
two
in
addition
to
men
society
also
consecrates
things
especially
ideas
if
a
belief
is
unanimously
shared
by
a
people
then
for
the
reason
which
we
pointed
out
above
it
is
forbidden
to
touch
it
that
is
to
say
to
deny
it
or
to
contest
it
now
the
prohibition
of
criticism
is
an
interdiction
like
the
others
and
proves
the
presence
of
something
sacred
even
howsoever
great
may
be
the
liberty
which
we
accord
to
others
a
man
who
should
totally
deny
progress
or
ridicule
the
human
ideal
to
which
modern
societies
are
attached
would
produce
the
effect
of
a
sacrilege
there
is
at
least
one
principle
which
those
the
most
devoted
to
the
free
examination
of
everything
tend
to
place
above
discussion
and
to
regard
as
untouchable
that
is
to
say
as
sacred
this
is
the
very
principle
of
free
examination
this
aptitude
of
society
for
setting
itself
up
as
a
god
or
for
creating
gods
was
never
more
apparent
than
during
the
first
years
of
the
french
revolution
at
this
time
in
fact
under
the
influence
of
the
general
enthusiasm
things
purely
laïcal
by
nature
were
transformed
by
public
opinion
into
sacred
things
these
were
the
fatherland
liberty
reason
a
religion
tended
to
become
established
which
had
its
dogmas
symbols
altars
and
feasts
it
was
to
these
spontaneous
aspirations
that
the
cult
of
reason
and
the
supreme
being
attempted
to
give
a
sort
of
official
satisfaction
it
is
true
that
this
religious
renovation
had
only
an
ephemeral
duration
but
that
was
because
the
patriotic
enthusiasm
which
at
first
transported
the
masses
soon
relaxed
the
cause
being
gone
the
effect
could
not
remain
but
this
experiment
though
keeps
all
its
sociological
interest
it
remains
true
that
in
one
determined
case
we
have
seen
society
and
its
essential
ideas
become
directly
and
with
no
transfiguration
of
any
sort
the
object
of
a
veritable
cult
all
these
facts
allow
us
to
catch
glimpses
of
how
the
clan
was
able
to
awaken
within
its
members
the
idea
that
outside
of
them
there
exist
forces
which
dominate
them
and
at
the
same
time
sustain
them
that
is
to
say
in
fine
religious
forces
it
is
because
there
is
no
society
with
which
the
primitive
is
more
directly
and
closely
connected
the
bonds
uniting
him
to
the
tribe
are
much
more
lax
and
more
feebly
felt
although
this
is
not
at
all
strange
or
foreign
to
him
it
is
with
the
people
of
his
own
clan
that
he
has
the
greatest
number
of
things
in
common
it
is
the
action
of
this
group
that
he
feels
the
most
directly
so
it
is
this
also
which
in
preference
to
all
others
should
express
itself
in
religious
symbols
but
this
first
explanation
has
been
too
general
for
it
is
applicable
to
every
sort
of
society
indifferently
and
consequently
to
every
sort
of
religion
let
us
attempt
to
determine
exactly
what
form
this
collective
action
takes
in
the
clan
and
how
it
arouses
the
sensation
of
sacredness
there
for
there
is
no
place
where
it
is
more
easily
observable
or
more
apparent
in
its
results
iii
the
life
of
the
australian
societies
passes
alternately
through
two
distinct
phases
sometimes
the
population
is
broken
up
into
little
groups
who
wander
about
independently
of
one
another
in
their
various
occupations
each
family
lives
by
itself
hunting
and
fishing
and
in
a
word
trying
to
procure
its
indispensable
food
by
all
the
means
in
its
power
sometimes
on
the
contrary
the
population
concentrates
and
gathers
at
determined
points
for
a
length
of
time
varying
from
several
days
to
several
months
this
concentration
takes
place
when
a
clan
or
a
part
of
the
tribe
is
summoned
to
the
gathering
and
on
this
occasion
they
celebrate
a
religious
ceremony
or
else
hold
what
is
called
a
corrobbori
in
the
usual
ethnological
language
these
two
phases
are
contrasted
with
each
other
in
the
sharpest
way
in
the
first
economic
activity
is
the
preponderating
one
and
it
is
generally
of
a
very
mediocre
intensity
gathering
the
grains
or
herbs
that
are
necessary
for
food
or
hunting
and
fishing
are
not
occupations
to
awaken
very
lively
passions
the
dispersed
condition
in
which
the
society
finds
itself
results
in
making
its
life
uniform
languishing
and
dull
but
when
a
corrobbori
takes
place
everything
changes
since
the
emotional
and
passional
faculties
of
the
primitive
are
only
imperfectly
placed
under
the
control
of
his
reason
and
will
he
easily
loses
control
of
himself
any
event
of
some
importance
puts
him
quite
outside
himself
does
he
receive
good
news
there
are
at
once
transports
of
enthusiasm
in
the
contrary
conditions
he
is
to
be
seen
running
here
and
there
like
a
madman
giving
himself
up
to
all
sorts
of
immoderate
movements
crying
shrieking
rolling
in
the
dust
throwing
it
in
every
direction
biting
himself
brandishing
his
arms
in
a
furious
manner
etc
the
very
fact
of
the
concentration
acts
as
an
exceptionally
powerful
stimulant
when
they
are
once
come
together
a
sort
of
electricity
is
formed
by
their
collecting
which
quickly
transports
them
to
an
extraordinary
degree
of
exaltation
every
sentiment
expressed
finds
a
place
without
resistance
in
all
the
minds
which
are
very
open
to
outside
impressions
each
the
others
and
is
by
the
others
the
initial
impulse
thus
proceeds
growing
as
it
goes
as
an
avalanche
grows
in
its
advance
and
as
such
active
passions
so
free
from
all
control
could
not
fail
to
burst
out
on
every
side
one
sees
nothing
but
violent
gestures
cries
veritable
howls
and
deafening
noises
of
every
sort
which
aid
in
intensifying
still
more
the
state
of
mind
which
they
manifest
and
since
a
collective
sentiment
can
not
express
itself
collectively
except
on
the
condition
of
observing
a
certain
order
permitting
and
movements
in
unison
these
gestures
and
cries
naturally
tend
to
become
rhythmic
and
regular
hence
come
songs
and
dances
but
in
taking
a
more
regular
form
they
lose
nothing
of
their
natural
violence
a
regulated
tumult
remains
tumult
the
human
voice
is
not
sufficient
for
the
task
it
is
reinforced
by
means
of
artificial
processes
boomerangs
are
beaten
against
each
other
are
whirled
it
is
probable
that
these
instruments
the
use
of
which
is
so
general
in
the
australian
religious
ceremonies
are
used
primarily
to
express
in
a
more
adequate
fashion
the
agitation
felt
but
while
they
express
it
they
also
strengthen
it
this
effervescence
often
reaches
such
a
point
that
it
causes
actions
the
passions
released
are
of
such
an
impetuosity
that
they
can
be
restrained
by
nothing
they
are
so
far
removed
from
their
ordinary
conditions
of
life
and
they
are
so
thoroughly
conscious
of
it
that
they
feel
that
they
must
set
themselves
outside
of
and
above
their
ordinary
morals
the
sexes
unite
contrarily
to
the
rules
governing
sexual
relations
men
exchange
wives
with
each
other
sometimes
even
incestuous
unions
which
in
normal
times
are
thought
abominable
and
are
severely
punished
are
now
contracted
openly
and
with
impunity
if
we
add
to
all
this
that
the
ceremonies
generally
take
place
at
night
in
a
darkness
pierced
here
and
there
by
the
light
of
fires
we
can
easily
imagine
what
effect
such
scenes
ought
to
produce
on
the
minds
of
those
who
participate
they
produce
such
a
violent
of
the
whole
physical
and
mental
life
that
it
can
not
be
supported
very
long
the
actor
taking
the
principal
part
finally
falls
exhausted
on
the
ground
to
illustrate
and
make
specific
this
necessarily
schematic
picture
let
us
describe
certain
scenes
taken
from
spencer
and
gillen
one
of
the
most
important
religious
ceremonies
among
the
warramunga
is
the
one
concerning
the
snake
wollunqua
it
consists
in
a
series
of
ceremonies
lasting
through
several
days
on
the
fourth
day
comes
the
following
scene
according
to
the
ceremonial
used
among
the
warramunga
representatives
of
the
two
phratries
take
part
one
as
officiants
the
other
as
preparers
and
assistants
only
the
members
of
the
uluuru
phratry
are
qualified
to
celebrate
the
rite
but
the
members
of
the
kingilli
phratry
must
decorate
the
actors
make
ready
the
place
and
the
instruments
and
play
the
part
of
an
audience
in
this
capacity
they
were
charged
with
making
a
sort
of
mound
in
advance
out
of
wet
sand
upon
which
a
design
is
marked
with
red
down
which
represents
the
snake
wollunqua
the
real
ceremony
only
commenced
after
nightfall
towards
ten
or
eleven
the
uluuru
and
kingilli
men
arrived
on
the
ground
sat
down
on
the
mound
and
commenced
to
sing
everyone
was
evidently
very
excited
a
little
later
in
the
evening
the
uluuru
brought
up
their
wives
and
gave
them
over
to
the
kingilli
who
had
intercourse
with
them
then
the
recently
initiated
young
men
were
brought
in
and
the
whole
ceremony
was
explained
to
them
in
detail
and
until
three
in
the
morning
singing
went
on
without
a
pause
then
followed
a
scene
of
the
wildest
excitement
while
fires
were
lighted
on
all
sides
making
the
whiteness
of
the
stand
out
sharply
against
the
surrounding
darkness
the
uluuru
knelt
down
one
behind
another
beside
the
mound
then
rising
from
the
ground
they
went
around
it
with
a
movement
in
unison
their
two
hands
resting
upon
their
thighs
then
a
little
farther
on
they
knelt
down
again
and
so
on
at
the
same
time
they
swayed
their
bodies
now
to
the
right
and
now
to
the
left
while
uttering
at
each
movement
a
piercing
cry
a
veritable
yell
yrrsh
yrrsh
in
the
meantime
the
kingilli
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
clanged
their
boomerangs
and
their
chief
was
even
more
agitated
than
his
companions
when
the
procession
of
the
uluuru
had
twice
gone
around
the
mound
quitting
the
kneeling
position
they
sat
down
and
commenced
to
sing
again
at
moments
the
singing
died
away
then
suddenly
took
up
again
when
day
commenced
to
dawn
all
leaped
to
their
feet
the
fires
that
had
gone
out
were
relighted
and
the
uluuru
urged
on
by
the
kingilli
attacked
the
mound
furiously
with
boomerangs
lances
and
clubs
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
torn
to
pieces
the
fires
died
away
and
profound
silence
reigned
again
a
still
more
violent
scene
at
which
these
same
observers
assisted
was
in
connection
with
the
fire
ceremonies
among
the
warramunga
commencing
at
nightfall
all
sorts
of
processions
dances
and
songs
had
taken
place
by
torchlight
the
general
effervescence
was
constantly
increasing
at
a
given
moment
twelve
assistants
each
took
a
great
lighted
torch
in
their
hands
and
one
of
them
holding
his
like
a
bayonet
charged
into
a
group
of
natives
blows
were
warded
off
with
clubs
and
spears
a
general
mêlée
followed
the
men
leaped
and
pranced
about
uttering
savage
yells
all
the
time
the
burning
torches
continually
came
crashing
down
on
the
heads
and
bodies
of
the
men
scattering
lighted
sparks
in
every
direction
the
smoke
the
blazing
torches
the
showers
of
sparks
falling
in
all
directions
and
the
masses
of
dancing
yelling
men
say
spencer
and
gillen
formed
altogether
a
genuinely
wild
and
savage
scene
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
in
words
one
can
readily
conceive
how
when
arrived
at
this
state
of
exaltation
a
man
does
not
recognize
himself
any
longer
feeling
himself
dominated
and
carried
away
by
some
sort
of
an
external
power
which
makes
him
think
and
act
differently
than
in
normal
times
he
naturally
has
the
impression
of
being
himself
no
longer
it
seems
to
him
that
he
has
become
a
new
being
the
decorations
he
puts
on
and
the
masks
that
cover
his
face
figure
materially
in
this
interior
transformation
and
to
a
still
greater
extent
they
aid
in
determining
its
nature
and
as
at
the
same
time
all
his
companions
feel
themselves
transformed
in
the
same
way
and
express
this
sentiment
by
their
cries
their
gestures
and
their
general
attitude
everything
is
just
as
though
he
really
were
transported
into
a
special
world
entirely
different
from
the
one
where
he
ordinarily
lives
and
into
an
environment
filled
with
exceptionally
intense
forces
that
take
hold
of
him
and
metamorphose
him
how
could
such
experiences
as
these
especially
when
they
are
repeated
every
day
for
weeks
fail
to
leave
in
him
the
conviction
that
there
really
exist
two
heterogeneous
and
mutually
incomparable
worlds
one
is
that
where
his
daily
life
drags
wearily
along
but
he
can
not
penetrate
into
the
other
without
at
once
entering
into
relations
with
extraordinary
powers
that
excite
him
to
the
point
of
frenzy
the
first
is
the
profane
world
the
second
that
of
sacred
things
so
it
is
in
the
midst
of
these
effervescent
social
environments
and
out
of
this
effervescence
itself
that
the
religious
idea
seems
to
be
born
the
theory
that
this
is
really
its
origin
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
in
australia
the
really
religious
activity
is
almost
entirely
confined
to
the
moments
when
these
assemblies
are
held
to
be
sure
there
is
no
people
among
whom
the
great
solemnities
of
the
cult
are
not
more
or
less
periodic
but
in
the
more
advanced
societies
there
is
not
so
to
speak
a
day
when
some
prayer
or
offering
is
not
addressed
to
the
gods
and
some
ritual
act
is
not
performed
but
in
australia
on
the
contrary
apart
from
the
celebrations
of
the
clan
and
tribe
the
time
is
nearly
all
filled
with
lay
and
profane
occupations
of
course
there
are
prohibitions
that
should
be
and
are
preserved
even
during
these
periods
of
temporal
activity
it
is
never
permissible
to
kill
or
eat
freely
of
the
totemic
animal
at
least
in
those
parts
where
the
interdiction
has
retained
its
original
vigour
but
almost
no
positive
rites
are
then
celebrated
and
there
are
no
ceremonies
of
any
importance
these
take
place
only
in
the
midst
of
assembled
groups
the
religious
life
of
the
australian
passes
through
successive
phases
of
complete
lull
and
of
and
social
life
oscillates
in
the
same
rhythm
this
puts
clearly
into
evidence
the
bond
uniting
them
to
one
another
but
among
the
peoples
called
civilized
the
relative
continuity
of
the
two
blurs
their
relations
it
might
even
be
asked
whether
the
violence
of
this
contrast
was
not
necessary
to
disengage
the
feeling
of
sacredness
in
its
first
form
by
concentrating
itself
almost
entirely
in
certain
determined
moments
the
collective
life
has
been
able
to
attain
its
greatest
intensity
and
efficacy
and
consequently
to
give
men
a
more
active
sentiment
of
the
double
existence
they
lead
and
of
the
double
nature
in
which
they
participate
but
this
explanation
is
still
incomplete
we
have
shown
how
the
clan
by
the
manner
in
which
it
acts
upon
its
members
awakens
within
them
the
idea
of
external
forces
which
dominate
them
and
exalt
them
but
we
must
still
demand
how
it
happens
that
these
forces
are
thought
of
under
the
form
of
totems
that
is
to
say
in
the
shape
of
an
animal
or
plant
it
is
because
this
animal
or
plant
has
given
its
name
to
the
clan
and
serves
it
as
emblem
in
fact
it
is
a
law
that
the
sentiments
aroused
in
us
by
something
spontaneously
attach
themselves
to
the
symbol
which
represents
them
for
us
black
is
a
sign
of
mourning
it
also
suggests
sad
impressions
and
ideas
this
transference
of
sentiments
comes
simply
from
the
fact
that
the
idea
of
a
thing
and
the
idea
of
its
symbol
are
closely
united
in
our
minds
the
result
is
that
the
emotions
provoked
by
the
one
extend
contagiously
to
the
other
but
this
contagion
which
takes
place
in
every
case
to
a
certain
degree
is
much
more
complete
and
more
marked
when
the
symbol
is
something
simple
definite
and
easily
representable
while
the
thing
itself
owing
to
its
dimensions
the
number
of
its
parts
and
the
complexity
of
their
arrangement
is
difficult
to
hold
in
the
mind
for
we
are
unable
to
consider
an
abstract
entity
which
we
can
represent
only
laboriously
and
confusedly
the
source
of
the
strong
sentiments
which
we
feel
we
can
not
explain
them
to
ourselves
except
by
connecting
them
to
some
concrete
object
of
whose
reality
we
are
vividly
aware
then
if
the
thing
itself
does
not
fulfil
this
condition
it
can
not
serve
as
the
accepted
basis
of
the
sentiments
felt
even
though
it
may
be
what
really
aroused
them
then
some
sign
takes
its
place
it
is
to
this
that
we
connect
the
emotions
it
excites
it
is
this
which
is
loved
feared
respected
it
is
to
this
that
we
are
grateful
it
is
for
this
that
we
sacrifice
ourselves
the
soldier
who
dies
for
his
flag
dies
for
his
country
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
his
own
consciousness
it
is
the
flag
that
has
the
first
place
it
sometimes
happens
that
this
even
directly
determines
action
whether
one
isolated
standard
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
or
not
does
not
determine
the
fate
of
the
country
yet
the
soldier
allows
himself
to
be
killed
to
regain
it
he
loses
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
flag
is
only
a
sign
and
that
it
has
no
value
in
itself
but
only
brings
to
mind
the
reality
that
it
represents
it
is
treated
as
if
it
were
this
reality
itself
now
the
totem
is
the
flag
of
the
clan
it
is
therefore
natural
that
the
impressions
aroused
by
the
clan
in
individual
minds
impressions
of
dependence
and
of
increased
vitality
should
fix
themselves
to
the
idea
of
the
totem
rather
than
that
of
the
clan
for
the
clan
is
too
complex
a
reality
to
be
represented
clearly
in
all
its
complex
unity
by
such
rudimentary
intelligences
more
than
that
the
primitive
does
not
even
see
that
these
impressions
come
to
him
from
the
group
he
does
not
know
that
the
coming
together
of
a
number
of
men
associated
in
the
same
life
results
in
disengaging
new
energies
which
transform
each
of
them
all
that
he
knows
is
that
he
is
raised
above
himself
and
that
he
sees
a
different
life
from
the
one
he
ordinarily
leads
however
he
must
connect
these
sensations
to
some
external
object
as
their
cause
now
what
does
he
see
about
him
on
every
side
those
things
which
appeal
to
his
senses
and
strike
his
imagination
are
the
numerous
images
of
the
totem
they
are
the
waninga
and
the
nurtunja
which
are
symbols
of
the
sacred
being
they
are
churinga
and
upon
which
are
generally
carved
combinations
of
lines
having
the
same
significance
they
are
the
decorations
covering
the
different
parts
of
his
body
which
are
totemic
marks
how
could
this
image
repeated
everywhere
and
in
all
sorts
of
forms
fail
to
stand
out
with
exceptional
relief
in
his
mind
placed
thus
in
the
centre
of
the
scene
it
becomes
representative
the
sentiments
experienced
fix
themselves
upon
it
for
it
is
the
only
concrete
object
upon
which
they
can
fix
themselves
it
continues
to
bring
them
to
mind
and
to
evoke
them
even
after
the
assembly
has
dissolved
for
it
survives
the
assembly
being
carved
upon
the
instruments
of
the
cult
upon
the
sides
of
rocks
upon
bucklers
etc
by
it
the
emotions
experienced
are
perpetually
sustained
and
revived
everything
happens
just
as
if
they
inspired
them
directly
it
is
still
more
natural
to
attribute
them
to
it
for
since
they
are
common
to
the
group
they
can
be
associated
only
with
something
that
is
equally
common
to
all
now
the
totemic
emblem
is
the
only
thing
satisfying
this
condition
by
definition
it
is
common
to
all
during
the
ceremony
it
is
the
centre
of
all
regards
while
generations
change
it
remains
the
same
it
is
the
permanent
element
of
the
social
life
so
it
is
from
it
that
those
mysterious
forces
seem
to
emanate
with
which
men
feel
that
they
are
related
and
thus
they
have
been
led
to
represent
these
forces
under
the
form
of
the
animate
or
inanimate
being
whose
name
the
clan
bears
when
this
point
is
once
established
we
are
in
a
position
to
understand
all
that
is
essential
in
the
totemic
beliefs
since
religious
force
is
nothing
other
than
the
collective
and
anonymous
force
of
the
clan
and
since
this
can
be
represented
in
the
mind
only
in
the
form
of
the
totem
the
totemic
emblem
is
like
the
visible
body
of
the
god
therefore
it
is
from
it
that
those
kindly
or
dreadful
actions
seem
to
emanate
which
the
cult
seeks
to
provoke
or
prevent
consequently
it
is
to
it
that
the
cult
is
addressed
this
is
the
explanation
of
why
it
holds
the
first
place
in
the
series
of
sacred
things
but
the
clan
like
every
other
sort
of
society
can
live
only
in
and
through
the
individual
consciousnesses
that
compose
it
so
if
religious
force
in
so
far
as
it
is
conceived
as
incorporated
in
the
totemic
emblem
appears
to
be
outside
of
the
individuals
and
to
be
endowed
with
a
sort
of
transcendence
over
them
it
like
the
clan
of
which
it
is
the
symbol
can
be
realized
only
in
and
through
them
in
this
sense
it
is
imminent
in
them
and
they
necessarily
represent
it
as
such
they
feel
it
present
and
active
within
them
for
it
is
this
which
raises
them
to
a
superior
life
this
is
why
men
have
believed
that
they
contain
within
them
a
principle
comparable
to
the
one
residing
in
the
totem
and
consequently
why
they
have
attributed
a
sacred
character
to
themselves
but
one
less
marked
than
that
of
the
emblem
it
is
because
the
emblem
is
the
source
of
the
religious
life
the
man
participates
in
it
only
indirectly
as
he
is
well
aware
he
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
the
force
that
transports
him
into
the
world
of
sacred
things
is
not
inherent
in
him
but
comes
to
him
from
the
outside
but
for
still
another
reason
the
animals
or
vegetables
of
the
totemic
species
should
have
the
same
character
and
even
to
a
higher
degree
if
the
totemic
principle
is
nothing
else
than
the
clan
it
is
the
clan
thought
of
under
the
material
form
of
the
totemic
emblem
now
this
form
is
also
that
of
the
concrete
beings
whose
name
the
clan
bears
owing
to
this
resemblance
they
could
not
fail
to
evoke
sentiments
analogous
to
those
aroused
by
the
emblem
itself
since
the
latter
is
the
object
of
a
religious
respect
they
too
should
inspire
respect
of
the
same
sort
and
appear
to
be
sacred
having
external
forms
so
nearly
identical
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
native
not
to
attribute
to
them
forces
of
the
same
nature
it
is
therefore
forbidden
to
kill
or
eat
the
totemic
animal
since
its
flesh
is
believed
to
have
the
positive
virtues
resulting
from
the
rites
it
is
because
it
resembles
the
emblem
of
the
clan
that
is
to
say
it
is
in
its
own
image
and
since
the
animal
naturally
resembles
the
emblem
more
than
the
man
does
it
is
placed
on
a
superior
rank
in
the
hierarchy
of
sacred
things
between
these
two
beings
there
is
undoubtedly
a
close
relationship
for
they
both
partake
of
the
same
essence
both
incarnate
something
of
the
totemic
principle
however
since
the
principle
itself
is
conceived
under
an
animal
form
the
animal
seems
to
incarnate
it
more
fully
than
the
man
therefore
if
men
consider
it
and
treat
it
as
a
brother
it
is
at
least
as
an
elder
brother
but
even
if
the
totemic
principle
has
its
preferred
seat
in
a
determined
species
of
animal
or
vegetable
it
can
not
remain
localized
there
a
sacred
character
is
to
a
high
degree
contagious
it
therefore
spreads
out
from
the
totemic
being
to
everything
that
is
closely
or
remotely
connected
with
it
the
religious
sentiments
inspired
by
the
animal
are
communicated
to
the
substances
upon
which
it
is
nourished
and
which
serve
to
make
or
remake
its
flesh
and
blood
to
the
things
that
resemble
it
and
to
the
different
beings
with
which
it
has
constant
relations
thus
little
by
little
are
attached
to
the
totems
and
from
the
cosmological
systems
expressed
by
the
primitive
classifications
at
last
the
whole
world
is
divided
up
among
the
totemic
principles
of
each
tribe
we
are
now
able
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
ambiguity
of
religious
forces
as
they
appear
in
history
and
how
they
are
physical
as
well
as
human
moral
as
well
as
material
they
are
moral
powers
because
they
are
made
up
entirely
of
the
impressions
this
moral
being
the
group
arouses
in
those
other
moral
beings
its
individual
members
they
do
not
translate
the
manner
in
which
physical
things
affect
our
senses
but
the
way
in
which
the
collective
consciousness
acts
upon
individual
consciousnesses
their
authority
is
only
one
form
of
the
moral
ascendancy
of
society
over
its
members
but
on
the
other
hand
since
they
are
conceived
of
under
material
forms
they
could
not
fail
to
be
regarded
as
closely
related
to
material
things
therefore
they
dominate
the
two
worlds
their
residence
is
in
men
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
the
vital
principles
of
things
they
animate
minds
and
discipline
them
but
it
is
also
they
who
make
plants
grow
and
animals
reproduce
it
is
this
double
nature
which
has
enabled
religion
to
be
like
the
womb
from
which
come
all
the
leading
germs
of
human
civilization
since
it
has
been
made
to
embrace
all
of
reality
the
physical
world
as
well
as
the
moral
one
the
forces
that
move
bodies
as
well
as
those
that
move
minds
have
been
conceived
in
a
religious
form
that
is
how
the
most
diverse
methods
and
practices
both
those
that
make
possible
the
continuation
of
the
moral
life
law
morals
and
those
serving
the
material
life
the
natural
technical
and
practical
sciences
are
either
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
religion
iv
the
first
religious
conceptions
have
often
been
attributed
to
feelings
of
weakness
and
dependence
of
fear
and
anguish
which
seized
men
when
they
came
into
contact
with
the
world
being
the
victims
of
nightmares
of
which
they
were
themselves
the
creators
they
believed
themselves
surrounded
by
hostile
and
redoubtable
powers
which
their
rites
sought
to
appease
we
have
now
shown
that
the
first
religions
were
of
a
wholly
different
origin
the
famous
formula
in
orbe
deos
fecit
is
in
no
way
justified
by
the
facts
the
primitive
does
not
regard
his
gods
as
foreigners
enemies
or
thoroughly
and
necessarily
malevolent
beings
whose
favours
he
must
acquire
at
any
price
quite
on
the
contrary
they
are
rather
friends
kindred
or
natural
protectors
for
him
are
these
not
the
names
he
gives
to
the
beings
of
the
totemic
species
the
power
to
which
the
cult
is
addressed
is
not
represented
as
soaring
high
above
him
and
overwhelming
him
by
its
superiority
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
near
to
him
and
confers
upon
him
very
useful
powers
which
he
could
never
acquire
by
himself
perhaps
the
deity
has
never
been
nearer
to
men
than
at
this
period
of
history
when
it
is
present
in
the
things
filling
their
immediate
environment
and
is
in
part
imminent
in
himself
in
fine
the
sentiments
at
the
root
of
totemism
are
those
of
happy
confidence
rather
than
of
terror
and
compression
if
we
set
aside
the
funeral
rites
the
sober
side
of
every
religion
we
find
the
totemic
cult
celebrated
in
the
midst
of
songs
dances
and
dramatic
representations
as
we
shall
see
cruel
expiations
are
relatively
rare
even
the
painful
and
obligatory
mutilations
of
the
initiations
are
not
of
this
character
the
terrible
and
jealous
gods
appear
but
slowly
in
the
religious
evolution
this
is
because
primitive
societies
are
not
those
huge
leviathans
which
overwhelm
a
man
by
the
enormity
of
their
power
and
place
him
under
a
severe
discipline
he
gives
himself
up
to
them
spontaneously
and
without
resistance
as
the
social
soul
is
then
made
up
of
only
a
small
number
of
ideas
and
sentiments
it
easily
becomes
wholly
incarnate
in
each
individual
consciousness
the
individual
carries
it
all
inside
of
him
it
is
a
part
of
him
and
consequently
when
he
gives
himself
up
to
the
impulses
inspired
by
it
he
does
not
feel
that
he
is
giving
way
before
compulsion
but
that
he
is
going
where
his
nature
calls
him
this
way
of
understanding
the
origins
of
religious
thought
escapes
the
objections
raised
against
the
most
accredited
classical
theories
we
have
seen
how
the
naturists
and
animists
pretend
to
construct
the
idea
of
sacred
beings
out
of
the
sensations
evoked
in
us
by
different
phenomena
of
the
physical
or
biological
order
and
we
have
shown
how
this
enterprise
is
impossible
and
even
nothing
is
worth
nothing
the
impressions
produced
in
us
by
the
physical
world
can
by
definition
contain
nothing
that
surpasses
this
world
out
of
the
visible
only
the
visible
can
be
made
out
of
that
which
is
heard
we
can
not
make
something
not
heard
then
to
explain
how
the
idea
of
sacredness
has
been
able
to
take
form
under
these
conditions
the
majority
of
the
theorists
have
been
obliged
to
admit
that
men
have
superimposed
upon
reality
such
as
it
is
given
by
observation
an
unreal
world
constructed
entirely
out
of
the
fantastic
images
which
agitate
his
mind
during
a
dream
or
else
out
of
the
frequently
monstrous
aberrations
produced
by
the
mythological
imagination
under
the
bewitching
but
deceiving
influence
of
language
but
it
remained
incomprehensible
that
humanity
should
have
remained
obstinate
in
these
errors
through
the
ages
for
experience
should
have
very
quickly
proven
them
false
but
from
our
point
of
view
these
difficulties
disappear
religion
ceases
to
be
an
inexplicable
hallucination
and
takes
a
foothold
in
reality
in
fact
we
can
say
that
the
believer
is
not
deceived
when
he
believes
in
the
existence
of
a
moral
power
upon
which
he
depends
and
from
which
he
receives
all
that
is
best
in
himself
this
power
exists
it
is
society
when
the
australian
is
carried
outside
himself
and
feels
a
new
life
flowing
within
him
whose
intensity
surprises
him
he
is
not
the
dupe
of
an
illusion
this
exaltation
is
real
and
is
really
the
effect
of
forces
outside
of
and
superior
to
the
individual
it
is
true
that
he
is
wrong
in
thinking
that
this
increase
of
vitality
is
the
work
of
a
power
in
the
form
of
some
animal
or
plant
but
this
error
is
merely
in
regard
to
the
letter
of
the
symbol
by
which
this
being
is
represented
to
the
mind
and
the
external
appearance
which
the
imagination
has
given
it
and
not
in
regard
to
the
fact
of
its
existence
behind
these
figures
and
metaphors
be
they
gross
or
refined
there
is
a
concrete
and
living
reality
thus
religion
acquires
a
meaning
and
a
reasonableness
that
the
most
intransigent
rationalist
can
not
misunderstand
its
primary
object
is
not
to
give
men
a
representation
of
the
physical
world
for
if
that
were
its
essential
task
we
could
not
understand
how
it
has
been
able
to
survive
for
on
this
side
it
is
scarcely
more
than
a
fabric
of
errors
before
all
it
is
a
system
of
ideas
with
which
the
individuals
represent
to
themselves
the
society
of
which
they
are
members
and
the
obscure
but
intimate
relations
which
they
have
with
it
this
is
its
primary
function
and
though
metaphorical
and
symbolic
this
representation
is
not
unfaithful
quite
on
the
contrary
it
translates
everything
essential
in
the
relations
which
are
to
be
explained
for
it
is
an
eternal
truth
that
outside
of
us
there
exists
something
greater
than
us
with
which
we
enter
into
communion
that
is
why
we
can
rest
assured
in
advance
that
the
practices
of
the
cult
whatever
they
may
be
are
something
more
than
movements
without
importance
and
gestures
without
efficacy
by
the
mere
fact
that
their
apparent
function
is
to
strengthen
the
bonds
attaching
the
believer
to
his
god
they
at
the
same
time
really
strengthen
the
bonds
attaching
the
individual
to
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
since
the
god
is
only
a
figurative
expression
of
the
society
we
are
even
able
to
understand
how
the
fundamental
truth
thus
contained
in
religion
has
been
able
to
compensate
for
the
secondary
errors
which
it
almost
necessarily
implies
and
how
believers
have
consequently
been
restrained
from
tearing
themselves
off
from
it
in
spite
of
the
misunderstandings
which
must
result
from
these
errors
it
is
undeniably
true
that
the
recipes
which
it
recommends
that
men
use
to
act
upon
things
are
generally
found
to
be
ineffective
but
these
checks
can
have
no
profound
influence
for
they
do
not
touch
religion
in
its
fundamentals
however
it
may
be
objected
that
even
according
to
this
hypothesis
religion
remains
the
object
of
a
certain
delirium
what
other
name
can
we
give
to
that
state
when
after
a
collective
effervescence
men
believe
themselves
transported
into
an
entirely
different
world
from
the
one
they
have
before
their
eyes
it
is
certainly
true
that
religious
life
can
not
attain
a
certain
degree
of
intensity
without
implying
a
psychical
exaltation
not
far
removed
from
delirium
that
is
why
the
prophets
the
founders
of
religions
the
great
saints
in
a
word
the
men
whose
religious
consciousness
is
exceptionally
sensitive
very
frequently
give
signs
of
an
excessive
nervousness
that
is
even
pathological
these
physiological
defects
predestined
them
to
great
religious
rôles
the
ritual
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
is
to
be
explained
in
the
same
way
of
course
this
does
not
mean
that
an
ardent
religious
faith
is
necessarily
the
fruit
of
the
drunkenness
and
mental
derangement
which
accompany
it
but
as
experience
soon
informed
people
of
the
similarities
between
the
mentality
of
a
delirious
person
and
that
of
a
seer
they
sought
to
open
a
way
to
the
second
by
artificially
exciting
the
first
but
if
for
this
reason
it
may
be
said
that
religion
is
not
without
a
certain
delirium
it
must
be
added
that
this
delirium
if
it
has
the
causes
which
we
have
attributed
to
it
the
images
out
of
which
it
is
made
are
not
pure
illusions
like
those
the
naturists
and
animists
put
at
the
basis
of
religion
they
correspond
to
something
in
reality
of
course
it
is
only
natural
that
the
moral
forces
they
express
should
be
unable
to
affect
the
human
mind
powerfully
without
pulling
it
outside
itself
and
without
plunging
it
into
a
state
that
may
be
called
provided
that
the
word
be
taken
in
its
etymological
sense
greek
ekstasis
but
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
imaginary
quite
on
the
contrary
the
mental
agitation
they
cause
bears
witness
to
their
reality
it
is
merely
one
more
proof
that
a
very
intense
social
life
always
does
a
sort
of
violence
to
the
organism
as
well
as
to
the
individual
consciousness
which
interferes
with
its
normal
functioning
therefore
it
can
last
only
a
limited
length
of
time
moreover
if
we
give
the
name
delirious
to
every
state
in
which
the
mind
adds
to
the
immediate
data
given
by
the
senses
and
projects
its
own
sentiments
and
feelings
into
things
then
nearly
every
collective
representation
is
in
a
sense
delirious
religious
beliefs
are
only
one
particular
case
of
a
very
general
law
our
whole
social
environment
seems
to
us
to
be
filled
with
forces
which
really
exist
only
in
our
own
minds
we
know
what
the
flag
is
for
the
soldier
in
itself
it
is
only
a
piece
of
cloth
human
blood
is
only
an
organic
liquid
but
even
we
can
not
see
it
flowing
without
feeling
a
violent
emotion
which
its
properties
can
not
explain
from
the
physical
point
of
view
a
man
is
nothing
more
than
a
system
of
cells
or
from
the
mental
point
of
view
than
a
system
of
representations
in
either
case
he
differs
only
in
degree
from
animals
yet
society
conceives
him
and
obliges
us
to
conceive
him
as
invested
with
a
character
that
isolates
him
holds
at
a
distance
all
rash
encroachments
and
in
a
word
imposes
respect
this
dignity
which
puts
him
into
a
class
by
himself
appears
to
us
as
one
of
his
distinctive
attributes
although
we
can
find
nothing
in
the
empirical
nature
of
man
which
justifies
it
a
cancelled
postage
stamp
may
be
worth
a
fortune
but
surely
this
value
is
in
no
way
implied
in
its
natural
properties
in
a
sense
our
representation
of
the
external
world
is
undoubtedly
a
mere
fabric
of
hallucinations
for
the
odours
tastes
and
colours
that
we
put
into
bodies
are
not
really
there
or
at
least
they
are
not
such
as
we
perceive
them
however
our
olfactory
gustatory
and
visual
sensations
continue
to
correspond
to
certain
objective
states
of
the
things
represented
they
express
in
their
way
the
properties
either
of
material
particles
or
of
ether
waves
which
certainly
have
their
origin
in
the
bodies
which
we
perceive
as
fragrant
sapid
or
coloured
but
collective
representations
very
frequently
attribute
to
the
things
to
which
they
are
attached
qualities
which
do
not
exist
under
any
form
or
to
any
degree
out
of
the
commonest
object
they
can
make
a
most
powerful
sacred
being
yet
the
powers
which
are
thus
conferred
though
purely
ideal
act
as
though
they
were
real
they
determine
the
conduct
of
men
with
the
same
degree
of
necessity
as
physical
forces
the
arunta
who
has
been
rubbed
with
his
churinga
feels
himself
stronger
he
is
stronger
if
he
has
eaten
the
flesh
of
an
animal
which
though
perfectly
healthy
is
forbidden
to
him
he
will
feel
himself
sick
and
may
die
of
it
surely
the
soldier
who
falls
while
defending
his
flag
does
not
believe
that
he
sacrifices
himself
for
a
bit
of
cloth
this
is
all
because
social
thought
owing
to
the
imperative
authority
that
is
in
it
has
an
efficacy
that
individual
thought
could
never
have
by
the
power
which
it
has
over
our
minds
it
can
make
us
see
things
in
whatever
light
it
pleases
it
adds
to
reality
or
deducts
from
it
according
to
the
circumstances
thus
there
is
one
division
of
nature
where
the
formula
of
idealism
is
applicable
almost
to
the
letter
this
is
the
social
kingdom
here
more
than
anywhere
else
the
idea
is
the
reality
even
in
this
case
of
course
idealism
is
not
true
without
modification
we
can
never
escape
the
duality
of
our
nature
and
free
ourselves
completely
from
physical
necessities
in
order
to
express
our
own
ideas
to
ourselves
it
is
necessary
as
has
been
shown
above
that
we
fix
them
upon
material
things
which
symbolize
them
but
here
the
part
of
matter
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
the
object
serving
as
support
for
the
idea
is
not
much
in
comparison
with
the
ideal
superstructure
beneath
which
it
disappears
and
also
it
counts
for
nothing
in
the
superstructure
this
is
what
that
consists
in
which
we
find
at
the
bottom
of
so
many
collective
representations
it
is
only
a
form
of
this
essential
idealism
so
it
is
not
properly
called
a
delirium
for
the
ideas
thus
objectified
are
well
founded
not
in
the
nature
of
the
material
things
upon
which
they
settle
themselves
but
in
the
nature
of
society
we
are
now
able
to
understand
how
the
totemic
principle
and
in
general
every
religious
force
comes
to
be
outside
of
the
object
in
which
it
resides
it
is
because
the
idea
of
it
is
in
no
way
made
up
of
the
impressions
directly
produced
by
this
thing
upon
our
senses
or
minds
religious
force
is
only
the
sentiment
inspired
by
the
group
in
its
members
but
projected
outside
of
the
consciousnesses
that
experience
them
and
objectified
to
be
objectified
they
are
fixed
upon
some
object
which
thus
becomes
sacred
but
any
object
might
fulfil
this
function
in
principle
there
are
none
whose
nature
predestines
them
to
it
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
but
also
there
are
none
that
are
necessarily
impossible
everything
depends
upon
the
circumstances
which
lead
the
sentiment
creating
religious
ideas
to
establish
itself
here
or
there
upon
this
point
or
upon
that
one
therefore
the
sacred
character
assumed
by
an
object
is
not
implied
in
the
intrinsic
properties
of
this
latter
is
added
to
the
world
of
religious
things
is
not
one
particular
aspect
of
empirical
nature
is
superimposed
upon
this
conception
of
the
religious
finally
allows
us
to
explain
an
important
principle
found
at
the
bottom
of
a
multitude
of
myths
and
rites
and
which
may
be
stated
thus
when
a
sacred
thing
is
subdivided
each
of
its
parts
remains
equal
to
the
thing
itself
in
other
words
as
far
as
religious
thought
is
concerned
the
part
is
equal
to
the
whole
it
has
the
same
powers
the
same
efficacy
the
debris
of
a
relic
has
the
same
virtue
as
a
relic
in
good
condition
the
smallest
drop
of
blood
contains
the
same
active
principle
as
the
whole
thing
the
soul
as
we
shall
see
may
be
broken
up
into
nearly
as
many
pieces
as
there
are
organs
or
tissues
in
the
organism
each
of
these
partial
souls
is
worth
a
whole
soul
this
conception
would
be
inexplicable
if
the
sacredness
of
something
were
due
to
the
constituent
properties
of
the
thing
itself
for
in
that
case
it
should
vary
with
this
thing
increasing
and
decreasing
with
it
but
if
the
virtues
it
is
believed
to
possess
are
not
intrinsic
in
it
and
if
they
come
from
certain
sentiments
which
it
brings
to
mind
and
symbolizes
though
these
originate
outside
of
it
then
since
it
has
no
need
of
determined
dimensions
to
play
this
rôle
of
reminder
it
will
have
the
same
value
whether
it
is
entire
or
not
since
the
part
makes
us
think
of
the
whole
it
evokes
the
same
sentiments
as
the
whole
a
mere
fragment
of
the
flag
represents
the
fatherland
just
as
well
as
the
flag
itself
so
it
is
sacred
in
the
same
way
and
to
the
same
degree
v
but
if
this
theory
of
totemism
has
enabled
us
to
explain
the
most
characteristic
beliefs
of
this
religion
it
rests
upon
a
fact
not
yet
explained
when
the
idea
of
the
totem
the
emblem
of
the
clan
is
given
all
the
rest
follows
but
we
must
still
investigate
how
this
idea
has
been
formed
this
is
a
double
question
and
may
be
subdivided
as
follows
what
has
led
the
clan
to
choose
an
emblem
and
why
have
these
emblems
been
borrowed
from
the
animal
and
vegetable
worlds
and
particularly
from
the
former
that
an
emblem
is
useful
as
a
for
any
sort
of
a
group
it
is
superfluous
to
point
out
by
expressing
the
social
unity
in
a
material
form
it
makes
this
more
obvious
to
all
and
for
that
very
reason
the
use
of
emblematic
symbols
must
have
spread
quickly
when
once
thought
of
but
more
than
that
this
idea
should
spontaneously
arise
out
of
the
conditions
of
common
life
for
the
emblem
is
not
merely
a
convenient
process
for
clarifying
the
sentiment
society
has
of
itself
it
also
serves
to
create
this
sentiment
it
is
one
of
its
constituent
elements
in
fact
if
left
to
themselves
individual
consciousnesses
are
closed
to
each
other
they
can
communicate
only
by
means
of
signs
which
express
their
internal
states
if
the
communication
established
between
them
is
to
become
a
real
communion
that
is
to
say
a
fusion
of
all
particular
sentiments
into
one
common
sentiment
the
signs
expressing
them
must
themselves
be
fused
into
one
single
and
unique
resultant
it
is
the
appearance
of
this
that
informs
individuals
that
they
are
in
harmony
and
makes
them
conscious
of
their
moral
unity
it
is
by
uttering
the
same
cry
pronouncing
the
same
word
or
performing
the
same
gesture
in
regard
to
some
object
that
they
become
and
feel
themselves
to
be
in
unison
it
is
true
that
individual
representations
also
cause
reactions
in
the
organism
that
are
not
without
importance
however
they
can
be
thought
of
apart
from
these
physical
reactions
which
accompany
them
or
follow
them
but
which
do
not
constitute
them
but
it
is
quite
another
matter
with
collective
representations
they
presuppose
that
minds
act
and
react
upon
one
another
they
are
the
product
of
these
actions
and
reactions
which
are
themselves
possible
only
through
material
intermediaries
these
latter
do
not
confine
themselves
to
revealing
the
mental
state
with
which
they
are
associated
they
aid
in
creating
it
individual
minds
can
not
come
in
contact
and
communicate
with
each
other
except
by
coming
out
of
themselves
but
they
can
not
do
this
except
by
movements
so
it
is
the
homogeneity
of
these
movements
that
gives
the
group
consciousness
of
itself
and
consequently
makes
it
exist
when
this
homogeneity
is
once
established
and
these
movements
have
once
taken
a
stereotyped
form
they
serve
to
symbolize
the
corresponding
representations
but
they
symbolize
them
only
because
they
have
aided
in
forming
them
moreover
without
symbols
social
sentiments
could
have
only
a
precarious
existence
though
very
strong
as
long
as
men
are
together
and
influence
each
other
reciprocally
they
exist
only
in
the
form
of
recollections
after
the
assembly
has
ended
and
when
left
to
themselves
these
become
feebler
and
feebler
for
since
the
group
is
now
no
longer
present
and
active
individual
temperaments
easily
regain
the
upper
hand
the
violent
passions
which
may
have
been
released
in
the
heart
of
a
crowd
fall
away
and
are
extinguished
when
this
is
dissolved
and
men
ask
themselves
with
astonishment
how
they
could
ever
have
been
so
carried
away
from
their
normal
character
but
if
the
movements
by
which
these
sentiments
are
expressed
are
connected
with
something
that
endures
the
sentiments
themselves
become
more
durable
these
other
things
are
constantly
bringing
them
to
mind
and
arousing
them
it
is
as
though
the
cause
which
excited
them
in
the
first
place
continued
to
act
thus
these
systems
of
emblems
which
are
necessary
if
society
is
to
become
conscious
of
itself
are
no
less
indispensable
for
assuring
the
continuation
of
this
consciousness
so
we
must
refrain
from
regarding
these
symbols
as
simple
artifices
as
sorts
of
labels
attached
to
representations
already
made
in
order
to
make
them
more
manageable
they
are
an
integral
part
of
them
even
the
fact
that
collective
sentiments
are
thus
attached
to
things
completely
foreign
to
them
is
not
purely
conventional
it
illustrates
under
a
conventional
form
a
real
characteristic
of
social
facts
that
is
their
transcendence
over
individual
minds
in
fact
it
is
known
that
social
phenomena
are
born
not
in
individuals
but
in
the
group
whatever
part
we
may
take
in
their
origin
each
of
us
receives
them
from
without
so
when
we
represent
them
to
ourselves
as
emanating
from
a
material
object
we
do
not
completely
misunderstand
their
nature
of
course
they
do
not
come
from
the
specific
thing
to
which
we
connect
them
but
nevertheless
it
is
true
that
their
origin
is
outside
of
us
if
the
moral
force
sustaining
the
believer
does
not
come
from
the
idol
he
adores
or
the
emblem
he
venerates
still
it
is
from
outside
of
him
as
he
is
well
aware
the
objectivity
of
its
symbol
only
translates
its
externalness
thus
social
life
in
all
its
aspects
and
in
every
period
of
its
history
is
made
possible
only
by
a
vast
symbolism
the
material
emblems
and
figurative
representations
with
which
we
are
more
especially
concerned
in
our
present
study
are
one
form
of
this
but
there
are
many
others
collective
sentiments
can
just
as
well
become
incarnate
in
persons
or
formulæ
some
formulæ
are
flags
while
there
are
persons
either
real
or
mythical
who
are
symbols
but
there
is
one
sort
of
emblem
which
should
make
an
early
appearance
without
reflection
or
calculation
this
is
tattooing
indeed
facts
demonstrate
that
it
is
produced
almost
automatically
in
certain
conditions
when
men
of
an
inferior
culture
are
associated
in
a
common
life
they
are
frequently
led
by
an
instinctive
tendency
as
it
were
to
paint
or
cut
upon
the
body
images
that
bear
witness
to
their
common
existence
according
to
a
text
of
procopius
the
early
christians
printed
on
their
skin
the
name
of
christ
or
the
sign
of
the
cross
for
a
long
time
the
groups
of
pilgrims
going
to
palestine
were
also
tattooed
on
the
arm
or
wrist
with
designs
representing
the
cross
or
the
monogram
of
christ
this
same
usage
is
also
reported
among
the
pilgrims
going
to
certain
holy
places
in
italy
a
curious
case
of
spontaneous
tattooing
is
given
by
lombroso
twenty
young
men
in
an
italian
college
when
on
the
point
of
separating
decorated
themselves
with
tattoos
recording
in
various
ways
the
years
they
had
spent
together
the
same
fact
has
frequently
been
observed
among
the
soldiers
in
the
same
barracks
the
sailors
in
the
same
boat
or
the
prisoners
in
the
same
jail
it
will
be
understood
that
especially
where
methods
are
still
rudimentary
tattooing
should
be
the
most
direct
and
expressive
means
by
which
the
communion
of
minds
can
be
affirmed
the
best
way
of
proving
to
self
and
to
others
that
one
is
a
member
of
a
certain
group
is
to
place
a
distinctive
mark
on
the
body
the
proof
that
this
is
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
totemic
image
is
the
fact
which
we
have
already
mentioned
that
it
does
not
seek
to
reproduce
the
aspect
of
the
thing
it
is
supposed
to
represent
it
is
made
up
of
lines
and
points
to
which
a
wholly
conventional
significance
is
attributed
its
object
is
not
to
represent
or
bring
to
mind
a
determined
object
but
to
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
a
certain
number
of
individuals
participate
in
the
same
moral
life
moreover
the
clan
is
a
society
which
is
less
able
than
any
other
to
do
without
an
emblem
or
symbol
for
there
is
almost
no
other
so
lacking
in
consistency
the
clan
can
not
be
defined
by
its
chief
for
if
central
authority
is
not
lacking
it
is
at
least
uncertain
and
unstable
nor
can
it
be
defined
by
the
territory
it
occupies
for
the
population
being
nomad
is
not
closely
attached
to
any
special
locality
also
owing
to
the
exogamic
law
husband
and
wife
must
be
of
different
totems
so
wherever
the
totem
is
transmitted
in
the
maternal
line
and
this
system
of
filiation
is
still
the
most
general
one
the
children
are
of
a
different
clan
from
their
father
though
living
near
to
him
therefore
we
find
representatives
of
a
number
of
different
clans
in
each
family
and
still
more
in
each
locality
the
unity
of
the
group
is
visible
therefore
only
in
the
collective
name
borne
by
all
the
members
and
in
the
equally
collective
emblem
reproducing
the
object
designated
by
this
name
a
clan
is
essentially
a
reunion
of
individuals
who
bear
the
same
name
and
rally
around
the
same
sign
take
away
the
name
and
the
sign
which
materializes
it
and
the
clan
is
no
longer
representable
since
the
group
is
possible
only
on
this
condition
both
the
institution
of
the
emblem
and
the
part
it
takes
in
the
life
of
the
group
are
thus
explained
it
remains
to
ask
why
these
names
and
emblems
were
taken
almost
exclusively
from
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
but
especially
from
the
former
it
seems
probable
to
us
that
the
emblem
has
played
a
more
important
part
than
the
name
in
any
case
the
written
sign
still
holds
a
more
central
place
in
the
life
of
the
clan
than
does
the
spoken
sign
now
the
basis
of
an
emblematic
image
can
be
found
only
in
something
susceptible
of
being
represented
by
a
design
on
the
other
hand
these
things
had
to
be
those
with
which
the
men
of
the
clan
were
the
most
immediately
and
habitually
coming
in
contact
animals
fulfilled
this
condition
to
a
degree
for
these
nations
of
hunters
and
fishers
the
animal
constituted
an
essential
element
of
the
economic
environment
in
this
connection
plants
had
only
a
secondary
place
for
they
can
hold
only
a
secondary
place
as
food
as
long
as
they
are
not
cultivated
moreover
the
animal
is
more
closely
associated
with
the
life
of
men
than
the
plant
is
if
only
because
of
the
natural
kinship
uniting
these
two
to
each
other
on
the
other
hand
the
sun
moon
and
stars
are
too
far
away
they
give
the
effect
of
belonging
to
another
world
also
as
long
as
the
constellations
were
not
distinguished
and
classified
the
starry
vault
did
not
offer
a
sufficient
diversity
of
clearly
differentiated
things
to
be
able
to
mark
all
the
clans
and
of
a
tribe
but
on
the
contrary
the
variety
of
the
flora
and
especially
of
the
fauna
was
almost
inexhaustible
therefore
celestial
bodies
in
spite
of
their
brilliancy
and
the
sharp
impression
they
make
upon
the
senses
were
unfitted
for
the
rôle
of
totems
while
animals
and
plants
seemed
predestined
to
it
ah
observation
of
strehlow
even
allows
us
to
state
precisely
the
way
in
which
these
emblems
were
probably
chosen
he
says
that
he
has
noticed
that
the
totemic
centres
are
generally
situated
near
a
mountain
spring
or
gorge
where
the
animals
serving
as
totems
to
the
group
gather
in
abundance
and
he
cites
a
certain
number
of
examples
of
this
fact
now
these
totemic
centres
are
surely
the
consecrated
places
where
the
meetings
of
the
clan
are
held
so
it
seems
as
though
each
group
had
taken
as
its
insignia
the
animal
or
plant
that
was
the
commonest
in
the
vicinity
of
the
place
where
it
had
the
habit
of
meeting
vi
this
conception
of
totemism
will
give
us
the
explanation
of
a
very
curious
trait
of
human
mentality
which
even
though
more
marked
formerly
than
has
not
yet
disappeared
and
which
in
any
case
has
been
of
considerable
importance
in
the
history
of
human
thought
it
will
furnish
still
another
occasion
for
showing
how
logical
evolution
is
closely
connected
with
religious
evolution
and
how
it
like
this
latter
depends
upon
social
conditions
if
there
is
one
truth
which
appears
to
be
absolutely
certain
it
is
that
beings
differing
not
only
in
their
outward
appearance
but
also
in
their
most
essential
properties
such
as
minerals
plants
animals
and
men
can
not
be
considered
equivalent
and
interchangeable
long
usage
which
scientific
culture
has
still
more
firmly
embedded
in
our
minds
has
taught
us
to
establish
barriers
between
the
kingdoms
whose
existence
transformism
itself
does
not
deny
for
though
this
admits
that
life
may
have
arisen
from
matter
and
men
from
animals
still
it
does
not
fail
to
recognize
the
fact
that
living
beings
once
formed
are
different
from
minerals
and
men
different
from
animals
within
each
kingdom
the
same
barriers
separate
the
different
classes
we
can
not
conceive
of
one
mineral
having
the
same
distinctive
characteristics
as
another
or
of
one
animal
species
having
those
of
another
species
but
these
distinctions
which
seem
so
natural
to
us
are
in
no
way
primitive
in
the
beginning
all
the
kingdoms
are
confounded
with
each
other
rocks
have
a
sex
they
have
the
power
of
begetting
the
sun
moon
and
stars
are
men
or
women
who
feel
and
express
human
sentiments
while
men
on
the
contrary
are
thought
of
as
animals
or
plants
this
state
of
confusion
is
found
at
the
basis
of
all
mythologies
hence
comes
the
ambiguous
character
of
the
beings
portrayed
in
the
mythologies
they
can
be
classified
in
no
definite
group
for
they
participate
at
the
same
time
in
the
most
opposed
groups
it
is
also
readily
admitted
that
they
can
go
from
one
into
another
and
for
a
long
time
men
believed
that
they
were
able
to
explain
the
origin
of
things
by
these
transmutations
that
the
anthropomorphic
instinct
with
which
the
animists
have
endowed
primitive
men
can
not
explain
their
mental
condition
is
shown
by
the
nature
of
the
confusions
of
which
they
are
guilty
in
fact
these
do
not
come
from
the
fact
that
men
have
immoderately
extended
the
human
kingdom
to
the
point
of
making
all
the
others
enter
into
it
but
from
the
fact
that
they
confound
the
most
disparate
kingdoms
they
have
not
conceived
the
world
in
their
own
image
any
more
than
they
have
conceived
themselves
in
the
world
image
they
have
done
both
at
the
same
time
into
the
idea
they
have
formed
of
things
they
have
undoubtedly
made
human
elements
enter
but
into
the
idea
they
have
formed
of
themselves
they
have
made
enter
elements
coming
from
things
yet
there
is
nothing
in
experience
which
could
suggest
these
connections
and
confusions
as
far
as
the
observation
of
the
senses
is
able
to
go
everything
is
different
and
disconnected
nowhere
do
we
really
see
beings
mixing
their
natures
and
metamorphosing
themselves
into
each
other
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
some
exceptionally
powerful
cause
should
have
intervened
to
transfigure
reality
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
appear
under
an
aspect
that
is
not
really
its
own
it
is
religion
that
was
the
agent
of
this
transfiguration
it
is
religious
beliefs
that
have
substituted
for
the
world
as
it
is
perceived
by
the
senses
another
different
one
this
is
well
shown
by
the
case
of
totemism
the
fundamental
thing
in
this
religion
is
that
the
men
of
the
clan
and
the
different
beings
whose
form
the
totemic
emblems
reproduce
pass
as
being
made
of
the
same
essence
now
when
this
belief
was
once
admitted
the
bridge
between
the
different
kingdoms
was
already
built
the
man
was
represented
as
a
sort
of
animal
or
plant
the
plants
and
animals
were
thought
of
as
the
relatives
of
men
or
rather
all
these
beings
so
different
for
the
senses
were
thought
of
as
participating
in
a
single
nature
so
this
remarkable
aptitude
for
confusing
things
that
seem
to
be
obviously
distinct
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
first
forces
with
which
the
human
intellect
has
peopled
the
world
were
elaborated
by
religion
since
these
were
made
up
of
elements
taken
from
the
different
kingdoms
men
conceived
a
principle
common
to
the
most
heterogeneous
things
which
thus
became
endowed
with
a
sole
and
single
essence
but
we
also
know
that
these
religious
conceptions
are
the
result
of
determined
social
causes
since
the
clan
can
not
exist
without
a
name
and
an
emblem
and
since
this
emblem
is
always
before
the
eyes
of
men
it
is
upon
this
and
the
objects
whose
image
it
is
that
the
sentiments
which
society
arouses
in
its
members
are
fixed
men
were
thus
compelled
to
represent
the
collective
force
whose
action
they
felt
in
the
form
of
the
thing
serving
as
flag
to
the
group
therefore
in
the
idea
of
this
force
were
mixed
up
the
most
different
kingdoms
in
one
sense
it
was
essentially
human
since
it
was
made
up
of
human
ideas
and
sentiments
but
at
the
same
time
it
could
not
fail
to
appear
as
closely
related
to
the
animate
or
inanimate
beings
who
gave
it
its
outward
form
moreover
the
cause
whose
action
we
observe
here
is
not
peculiar
to
totemism
there
is
no
society
where
it
is
not
active
in
a
general
way
a
collective
sentiment
can
become
conscious
of
itself
only
by
being
fixed
upon
some
material
object
but
by
this
very
fact
it
participates
in
the
nature
of
this
object
and
reciprocally
the
object
participates
in
its
nature
so
it
was
social
necessity
which
brought
about
the
fusion
of
notions
appearing
distinct
at
first
and
social
life
has
facilitated
this
fusion
by
the
great
mental
effervescences
it
determines
this
is
one
more
proof
that
logical
understanding
is
a
function
of
society
for
it
takes
the
forms
and
attitudes
that
this
latter
presses
upon
it
it
is
true
that
this
logic
is
disconcerting
for
us
yet
we
must
be
careful
not
to
depreciate
it
howsoever
crude
it
may
appear
to
us
it
has
been
an
aid
of
the
greatest
importance
in
the
intellectual
evolution
of
humanity
in
fact
it
is
through
it
that
the
first
explanation
of
the
world
has
been
made
possible
of
course
the
mental
habits
it
implies
prevented
men
from
seeing
reality
as
their
senses
show
it
to
them
but
as
they
show
it
it
has
the
grave
inconvenience
of
allowing
of
no
explanation
for
to
explain
is
to
attach
things
to
each
other
and
to
establish
relations
between
them
which
make
them
appear
to
us
as
functions
of
each
other
and
as
vibrating
sympathetically
according
to
an
internal
law
founded
in
their
nature
but
sensations
which
see
nothing
except
from
the
outside
could
never
make
them
disclose
these
relations
and
internal
bonds
the
intellect
alone
can
create
the
notion
of
them
when
i
learn
that
a
regularly
precedes
b
my
knowledge
is
increased
by
a
new
fact
but
my
intelligence
is
not
at
all
satisfied
with
a
statement
which
does
not
show
its
reason
i
commence
to
only
if
it
is
possible
for
me
to
conceive
b
in
a
way
that
makes
it
appear
to
me
as
something
that
is
not
foreign
to
a
and
as
united
to
a
by
some
relation
of
kinship
the
great
service
that
religions
have
rendered
to
thought
is
that
they
have
constructed
a
first
representation
of
what
these
relations
of
kinship
between
things
may
be
in
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
attempted
the
enterprise
could
obviously
attain
only
precarious
results
but
then
does
it
ever
attain
any
that
are
definite
and
is
it
not
always
necessary
to
reconsider
them
and
also
it
is
less
important
to
succeed
than
to
try
the
essential
thing
was
not
to
leave
the
mind
enslaved
to
visible
appearances
but
to
teach
it
to
dominate
them
and
to
connect
what
the
senses
separated
for
from
the
moment
when
men
have
an
idea
that
there
are
internal
connections
between
things
science
and
philosophy
become
possible
religion
opened
up
the
way
for
them
but
if
it
has
been
able
to
play
this
part
it
is
only
because
it
is
a
social
affair
in
order
to
make
a
law
for
the
impressions
of
the
senses
and
to
substitute
a
new
way
of
representing
reality
for
them
thought
of
a
new
sort
had
to
be
founded
this
is
collective
thought
if
this
alone
has
had
this
efficacy
it
is
because
of
the
fact
that
to
create
a
world
of
ideals
through
which
the
world
of
experienced
realities
would
appear
transfigured
a
of
the
intellectual
forces
was
necessary
which
is
possible
only
in
and
through
society
so
it
is
far
from
true
that
this
mentality
has
no
connection
with
ours
our
logic
was
born
of
this
logic
the
explanations
of
contemporary
science
are
surer
of
being
objective
because
they
are
more
methodical
and
because
they
rest
on
more
carefully
controlled
observations
but
they
do
not
differ
in
nature
from
those
which
satisfy
primitive
thought
as
formerly
to
explain
is
to
show
how
one
thing
participates
in
one
or
several
others
it
has
been
said
that
the
participations
of
this
sort
implied
by
the
mythologies
violate
the
principle
of
contradiction
and
that
they
are
by
that
opposed
to
those
implied
by
scientific
explanations
is
not
the
statement
that
a
man
is
a
kangaroo
or
the
sun
a
bird
equal
to
identifying
the
two
with
each
other
but
our
manner
of
thought
is
not
different
when
we
say
of
heat
that
it
is
a
movement
or
of
light
that
it
is
a
vibration
of
the
ether
etc
every
time
that
we
unite
heterogeneous
terms
by
an
internal
bond
we
forcibly
identify
contraries
of
course
the
terms
we
unite
are
not
those
which
the
australian
brings
together
we
choose
them
according
to
different
criteria
and
for
different
reasons
but
the
processes
by
which
the
mind
puts
them
in
connection
do
not
differ
essentially
it
is
true
that
if
primitive
thought
had
that
sort
of
general
and
systematic
indifference
to
contradictions
which
has
been
attributed
to
it
it
would
be
in
open
contradiction
on
this
point
with
modern
thought
which
is
always
careful
to
remain
consistent
with
itself
but
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
characterize
the
mentality
of
inferior
societies
by
a
single
and
exclusive
inclination
for
indistinction
if
the
primitive
confounds
things
which
we
distinguish
he
also
distinguishes
things
which
we
connect
together
and
he
even
conceives
these
distinctions
in
the
form
of
sharp
and
oppositions
between
two
things
which
are
classified
in
two
different
phratries
there
is
not
only
separation
but
even
antagonism
for
this
reason
the
same
australian
who
confounds
the
sun
and
the
white
cockatoo
opposes
this
latter
to
the
black
cockatoo
as
to
its
contrary
the
two
seem
to
him
to
belong
to
two
separate
classes
between
which
there
is
nothing
in
common
a
still
more
marked
opposition
is
that
existing
between
sacred
things
and
profane
things
they
repel
and
contradict
each
other
with
so
much
force
that
the
mind
refuses
to
think
of
them
at
the
same
time
they
mutually
expel
each
other
from
the
consciousness
thus
between
the
logic
of
religious
thought
and
that
of
scientific
thought
there
is
no
abyss
the
two
are
made
up
of
the
same
elements
though
inequally
and
differently
developed
the
special
characteristic
of
the
former
seems
to
be
its
natural
taste
for
immoderate
confusions
as
well
as
sharp
contrasts
it
is
voluntarily
excessive
in
each
direction
when
it
connects
it
confounds
when
it
distinguishes
it
opposes
it
knows
no
shades
and
measures
it
seeks
extremes
it
consequently
employs
logical
mechanisms
with
a
certain
awkwardness
but
it
ignores
none
of
them
chapter
viii
the
idea
of
the
soul
in
the
preceding
chapters
we
have
been
studying
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
totemic
religion
we
have
seen
that
no
idea
of
soul
or
spirit
or
mythical
personality
is
to
be
found
among
these
yet
even
if
the
idea
of
spiritual
beings
is
not
at
the
foundation
of
totemism
or
consequently
of
religious
thought
in
general
still
there
is
no
religion
where
this
notion
is
not
met
with
so
it
is
important
to
see
how
it
is
formed
to
make
sure
that
it
is
the
product
of
a
secondary
formation
we
must
discover
the
way
in
which
it
is
derived
from
the
more
essential
conceptions
which
we
have
just
described
and
explained
among
the
various
spiritual
beings
there
is
one
which
should
receive
our
attention
first
of
all
because
it
is
the
prototype
after
which
the
others
have
been
constructed
this
is
the
soul
i
just
as
there
is
no
known
society
without
a
religion
so
there
exist
none
howsoever
crudely
organized
they
may
be
where
we
do
not
find
a
whole
system
of
collective
representations
concerning
the
soul
its
origin
and
its
destiny
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
judge
from
the
data
of
ethnology
the
idea
of
the
soul
seems
to
have
been
contemporaneous
with
humanity
itself
and
it
seems
to
have
had
all
of
its
essential
characteristics
so
well
formulated
at
the
very
outset
that
the
work
of
the
more
advanced
religions
and
philosophy
has
been
practically
confined
to
refining
it
while
adding
nothing
that
is
really
fundamental
in
fact
all
the
australian
societies
admit
that
every
human
body
shelters
an
interior
being
the
principle
of
the
life
which
animates
it
this
is
the
soul
it
sometimes
happens
it
is
true
that
women
form
an
exception
to
this
general
rule
there
are
tribes
where
they
are
believed
to
have
no
souls
if
dawson
is
to
be
believed
it
is
the
same
with
young
children
in
the
tribes
that
he
has
observed
but
these
are
exceptional
and
probably
late
cases
the
last
one
even
seems
to
be
suspect
and
may
well
be
due
to
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
facts
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
the
idea
which
the
australian
makes
of
the
soul
because
it
is
so
obscure
and
floating
but
we
should
not
be
surprised
at
this
if
someone
asked
our
own
contemporaries
or
even
those
of
them
who
believe
most
firmly
in
the
existence
of
the
soul
how
they
represented
it
the
replies
that
he
would
receive
would
not
have
much
more
coherence
and
precision
this
is
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
complex
notion
into
which
a
multitude
of
badly
analysed
impressions
enter
whose
elaboration
has
been
carried
on
for
centuries
though
men
have
had
no
clear
consciousness
of
it
yet
from
this
come
the
most
essential
though
frequently
contradictory
characteristics
by
which
it
is
defined
in
some
cases
they
tell
us
that
it
has
the
external
appearance
of
the
body
but
sometimes
it
is
also
represented
as
having
the
size
of
a
grain
of
sand
its
dimensions
are
so
reduced
that
it
can
pass
through
the
smallest
crevices
or
the
finest
tissues
we
shall
also
see
that
it
is
represented
in
the
appearance
of
animals
this
shows
that
its
form
is
essentially
inconsistent
and
undetermined
it
varies
from
one
moment
to
another
with
the
demands
of
circumstances
or
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
myth
and
the
rite
the
substance
out
of
which
it
is
made
is
no
less
indefinable
it
is
not
without
matter
for
it
has
a
form
howsoever
vague
this
may
be
and
in
fact
even
during
this
life
it
has
physical
needs
it
eats
and
inversely
it
may
be
eaten
sometimes
it
leaves
the
body
and
in
the
course
of
its
travels
it
occasionally
nourishes
itself
on
foreign
souls
after
it
has
once
been
completely
freed
from
the
organism
it
is
thought
to
lead
a
life
absolutely
analogous
to
the
one
it
led
in
this
world
it
eats
drinks
hunts
etc
when
it
flutters
among
the
branches
of
trees
it
causes
rustlings
and
crackings
which
even
profane
ears
hear
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
believed
to
be
invisible
to
the
vulgar
it
is
true
that
magicians
or
old
men
have
the
faculty
of
seeing
souls
but
it
is
in
virtue
of
special
powers
which
they
owe
either
to
age
or
to
a
special
training
that
they
perceive
things
which
escape
our
senses
according
to
dawson
ordinary
individuals
enjoy
the
same
privilege
at
only
one
moment
of
their
existence
when
they
are
on
the
eve
of
a
premature
death
therefore
this
vision
is
considered
a
sinister
omen
now
invisibility
is
generally
considered
one
of
the
signs
of
spirituality
so
the
soul
is
conceived
as
being
immaterial
to
a
certain
degree
for
it
does
not
affect
the
senses
in
the
way
bodies
do
it
has
no
bones
as
the
tribes
of
the
tully
river
say
in
order
to
conciliate
all
these
opposed
characteristics
they
represent
it
as
made
of
some
infinitely
rare
and
subtle
matter
like
something
ethereal
and
comparable
to
a
shadow
or
breath
it
is
distinct
and
independent
of
the
body
for
during
this
life
it
can
leave
it
at
any
moment
it
does
leave
it
during
sleep
fainting
spells
etc
it
may
even
remain
absent
for
some
time
without
entailing
death
however
during
these
absences
life
is
weakened
and
even
stops
if
the
soul
does
not
return
home
but
it
is
especially
at
death
that
this
distinction
and
independence
manifest
themselves
with
the
greatest
clarity
while
the
body
no
longer
exists
and
no
visible
traces
of
it
remain
the
soul
continues
to
live
it
leads
an
autonomous
existence
in
another
world
but
howsoever
real
this
duality
may
be
it
is
in
no
way
absolute
it
would
show
a
grave
misunderstanding
to
represent
the
body
as
a
sort
of
habitat
in
which
the
soul
resides
but
with
which
it
has
only
external
relations
quite
on
the
contrary
it
is
united
to
it
by
the
closest
bonds
it
is
separable
from
it
only
imperfectly
and
with
difficulty
we
have
already
seen
that
it
has
or
at
least
is
able
to
have
its
external
aspect
consequently
everything
that
hurts
the
one
hurts
the
other
every
wound
of
the
body
spreads
to
the
soul
it
is
so
intimately
associated
with
the
life
of
the
organism
that
it
grows
with
it
and
decays
with
it
this
is
why
a
man
who
has
attained
a
certain
age
enjoys
privileges
refused
to
young
men
it
is
because
the
religious
principle
within
him
has
acquired
greater
force
and
efficacy
as
he
has
advanced
in
life
but
when
senility
sets
in
and
the
old
man
is
no
longer
able
to
take
a
useful
part
in
the
great
religious
ceremonies
in
which
the
vital
interests
of
the
tribe
are
concerned
this
respect
is
no
longer
accorded
to
him
it
is
thought
that
weakness
of
the
body
is
communicated
to
the
soul
having
the
same
powers
no
longer
he
no
longer
has
a
right
to
the
same
prestige
there
is
not
only
a
close
union
of
soul
and
body
but
there
is
also
a
partial
confusion
of
the
two
just
as
there
is
something
of
the
body
in
the
soul
since
it
sometimes
reproduces
its
form
so
there
is
something
of
the
soul
in
the
body
certain
regions
and
certain
products
of
the
organism
are
believed
to
have
a
special
affinity
with
it
such
is
the
case
with
the
heart
the
breath
the
placenta
the
blood
the
shadow
the
liver
the
fat
of
the
liver
the
kidneys
etc
these
various
material
substrata
are
not
mere
habitations
of
the
soul
they
are
the
soul
itself
seen
from
without
when
blood
flows
the
soul
escapes
with
it
the
soul
is
not
in
the
breath
it
is
the
breath
it
and
the
part
of
the
body
where
it
resides
are
only
one
hence
comes
the
conception
according
to
which
a
man
has
a
number
of
souls
being
dispersed
in
various
parts
of
the
organism
the
soul
is
differentiated
and
broken
up
into
fragments
each
organ
has
individualized
as
it
were
the
portion
of
the
soul
which
it
contains
and
which
has
thus
become
a
distinct
entity
the
soul
of
the
heart
could
not
be
that
of
the
breath
or
the
shadow
or
the
placenta
while
they
are
all
related
still
they
are
to
be
distinguished
and
even
have
different
names
moreover
even
if
the
soul
is
localized
especially
in
certain
parts
of
the
organism
it
is
not
absent
from
the
others
in
varying
degrees
it
is
diffused
through
the
whole
body
as
is
well
shown
by
the
funeral
rites
after
the
last
breath
has
been
expired
and
the
soul
is
believed
to
be
gone
it
seems
as
though
it
should
profit
by
the
liberty
thus
regained
to
move
about
at
will
and
to
return
as
quickly
as
possible
to
its
real
home
which
is
elsewhere
nevertheless
it
remains
near
to
the
corpse
the
bond
uniting
them
has
been
loosened
but
not
broken
a
whole
series
of
special
rites
are
necessary
to
induce
it
to
depart
definitely
it
is
invited
to
go
by
gestures
and
significant
movements
the
way
is
laid
open
for
it
and
outlets
are
arranged
so
that
it
can
go
more
easily
this
is
because
it
has
not
left
the
body
entirely
it
was
too
closely
united
to
it
to
break
away
all
at
once
hence
comes
the
very
frequent
rite
of
funeral
anthropophagy
the
flesh
of
the
dead
is
eaten
because
it
is
thought
to
contain
a
sacred
principle
which
is
really
nothing
more
than
the
soul
in
order
to
drive
it
out
definitely
the
flesh
is
melted
either
by
submitting
it
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
or
to
that
of
an
artificial
fire
the
soul
departs
with
the
liquids
which
result
but
even
the
dry
bones
still
retain
some
part
of
it
therefore
they
can
be
used
as
sacred
objects
or
instruments
of
magic
or
if
someone
wishes
to
give
complete
liberty
to
the
principle
which
they
contain
he
breaks
these
but
a
moment
does
arrive
when
the
final
separation
is
accomplished
the
liberated
soul
takes
flight
but
by
nature
it
is
so
intimately
associated
with
the
body
that
this
removal
can
not
take
place
without
a
profound
change
in
its
condition
so
it
takes
a
new
name
also
although
keeping
all
the
distinctive
traits
of
the
individual
whom
it
animated
his
humours
and
his
good
and
bad
qualities
still
it
has
become
a
new
being
from
that
moment
a
new
existence
commences
for
it
it
goes
to
the
land
of
souls
this
land
is
conceived
differently
by
different
tribes
sometimes
different
conceptions
are
found
existing
side
by
side
in
the
same
society
for
some
it
is
situated
under
the
earth
where
each
totemic
group
has
its
part
this
is
at
the
spot
where
the
first
ancestors
the
founders
of
the
clan
entered
the
ground
at
a
certain
time
and
where
they
live
since
their
death
in
the
subterranean
world
there
is
a
geographical
disposition
of
the
dead
corresponding
to
that
of
the
living
there
the
sun
always
shines
and
rivers
flow
which
never
run
dry
such
is
the
conception
which
spencer
and
gillen
attribute
to
the
central
tribes
arunta
warramunga
etc
it
is
found
again
among
the
wotjobaluk
in
other
places
all
the
dead
no
matter
what
their
totems
may
have
been
are
believed
to
live
together
in
the
same
place
which
is
more
or
less
vaguely
localized
as
beyond
the
sea
in
an
island
or
on
the
shores
of
a
lake
sometimes
finally
it
is
into
the
sky
beyond
the
clouds
that
the
souls
are
thought
to
go
there
says
dawson
there
is
a
delectable
land
abounding
in
kangaroos
and
game
of
every
sort
where
men
lead
a
happy
life
souls
meet
again
there
and
recognize
one
another
it
is
probable
that
certain
of
the
features
of
this
picture
have
been
taken
from
the
paradise
of
the
christian
missionaries
but
the
idea
that
souls
or
at
least
some
souls
enter
the
skies
after
death
appears
to
be
quite
indigenous
for
it
is
found
again
in
other
parts
of
the
continent
in
general
all
the
souls
meet
the
same
fate
and
lead
the
same
life
however
a
different
treatment
is
sometimes
accorded
them
based
on
the
way
they
have
conducted
themselves
upon
earth
and
we
can
see
the
first
outlines
of
these
two
distinct
and
even
opposed
compartments
into
which
the
world
to
come
will
later
be
divided
the
souls
of
those
who
have
excelled
during
life
as
hunters
warriors
dancers
are
not
confounded
with
the
common
horde
of
the
others
a
special
place
is
granted
to
them
sometimes
this
is
the
sky
strehlow
even
says
that
according
to
one
myth
the
souls
of
the
wicked
are
devoured
by
dreadful
spirits
and
destroyed
nevertheless
these
conceptions
always
remain
very
vague
in
australia
they
begin
to
have
a
clarity
and
determination
only
in
the
more
advanced
societies
such
as
those
of
america
ii
such
are
the
beliefs
relative
to
the
soul
and
its
destiny
in
their
most
primitive
form
and
reduced
to
their
most
essential
traits
we
must
now
attempt
to
explain
them
what
is
it
that
has
been
able
to
lead
men
into
thinking
that
there
are
two
beings
in
them
one
of
which
possesses
these
very
special
characteristics
which
we
have
just
enumerated
to
find
the
reply
to
this
question
let
us
begin
by
seeking
the
origin
attributed
to
this
spiritual
principle
by
the
primitive
himself
if
it
is
well
analysed
his
own
conception
will
put
us
on
the
way
towards
the
solution
following
out
the
method
which
we
have
set
before
ourselves
we
shall
study
these
ideas
in
a
determined
group
of
societies
where
they
have
been
observed
with
an
especial
precision
these
are
the
tribes
of
central
australia
though
not
narrow
the
area
of
our
observations
will
be
limited
but
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
these
same
ideas
are
quite
generally
held
in
various
forms
even
outside
of
australia
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
the
idea
of
the
soul
as
it
is
found
among
these
central
tribes
does
not
differ
specifically
from
the
one
found
in
other
tribes
it
has
the
same
essential
characteristics
everywhere
as
one
effect
always
has
the
same
cause
we
may
well
think
that
this
idea
which
is
everywhere
the
same
does
not
result
from
one
cause
here
and
another
there
so
the
origin
which
we
shall
be
led
to
attribute
to
it
as
a
result
of
our
study
of
these
particular
tribes
with
which
we
are
going
to
deal
ought
to
be
equally
true
for
the
others
these
tribes
will
give
us
a
chance
to
make
an
experiment
as
it
were
whose
results
like
those
of
every
experiment
are
susceptible
of
generalization
the
homogeneity
of
the
australian
civilization
would
of
itself
be
enough
to
justify
this
generalization
but
we
shall
be
careful
to
verify
it
afterwards
with
facts
taken
from
other
peoples
both
in
australia
and
america
as
the
conceptions
which
are
going
to
furnish
us
with
the
basis
of
our
demonstration
have
been
reported
in
different
terms
by
spencer
and
gillen
on
the
one
hand
and
strehlow
on
the
other
we
must
give
these
two
versions
one
after
the
other
we
shall
see
that
when
they
are
well
understood
they
differ
in
form
more
than
in
matter
and
that
they
both
have
the
same
sociological
significance
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
the
souls
which
in
each
generation
come
to
animate
the
bodies
of
children
are
not
special
and
original
creations
all
these
tribes
hold
that
there
is
a
definite
stock
of
souls
whose
number
can
not
be
augmented
at
all
and
which
reincarnate
themselves
periodically
when
an
individual
dies
his
soul
quits
the
body
in
which
it
dwelt
and
after
the
mourning
is
accomplished
it
goes
to
the
land
of
the
souls
but
after
a
certain
length
of
time
it
returns
to
incarnate
itself
again
and
these
reincarnations
are
the
cause
of
conception
and
birth
at
the
beginning
of
things
it
was
these
fundamental
souls
which
animated
the
first
ancestors
the
founders
of
the
clan
at
an
epoch
beyond
which
the
imagination
does
not
go
and
which
is
considered
the
very
beginning
of
time
there
were
certain
beings
who
were
not
derived
from
any
others
for
this
reason
the
arunta
call
them
the
the
uncreated
ones
those
who
exist
from
all
eternity
and
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
they
give
the
name
to
the
period
when
these
fabulous
beings
are
thought
to
have
lived
being
organized
in
totemic
clans
just
as
the
men
of
are
they
passed
their
time
in
travels
in
the
course
of
which
they
accomplished
all
sorts
of
prodigious
actions
the
memory
of
which
is
preserved
in
the
myths
but
a
moment
arrived
when
this
terrestrial
life
came
to
a
close
singly
or
in
groups
they
entered
into
the
earth
but
their
souls
live
for
ever
they
are
immortal
they
even
continue
to
frequent
the
places
where
the
existence
of
their
former
hosts
came
to
an
end
moreover
owing
to
the
memories
attached
to
them
these
places
have
a
sacred
character
it
is
here
that
the
oknanikilla
are
located
the
sorts
of
sanctuaries
where
the
churinga
of
the
clan
is
kept
and
the
centres
of
the
different
totemic
cults
when
one
of
the
souls
which
wander
about
these
sanctuaries
enters
into
the
body
of
a
woman
the
result
is
a
conception
and
later
a
birth
so
each
individual
is
considered
as
a
new
appearance
of
a
determined
ancestor
it
is
this
ancestor
himself
come
back
in
a
new
body
and
with
new
features
now
what
were
these
ancestors
in
the
first
place
they
were
endowed
with
powers
infinitely
superior
to
those
possessed
by
men
even
the
most
respected
old
men
and
the
most
celebrated
magicians
they
are
attributed
virtues
which
we
may
speak
of
as
miraculous
they
could
travel
on
or
above
or
beneath
the
ground
by
opening
a
vein
in
the
arm
each
of
them
could
flood
whole
tracts
of
country
or
cause
level
plains
to
arise
in
rocky
ranges
they
could
make
pools
of
water
spring
into
existence
or
could
make
deep
gorges
and
gaps
through
which
to
traverse
the
ranges
and
where
they
planted
their
sacred
poles
nurtunja
there
rocks
or
trees
arose
to
mark
the
spot
it
is
they
who
gave
the
earth
the
form
it
has
at
present
they
created
all
sorts
of
beings
both
men
and
animals
they
are
nearly
gods
so
their
souls
also
have
a
divine
character
and
since
the
souls
of
men
are
these
ancestral
souls
reincarnated
in
the
human
body
these
are
sacred
beings
too
in
the
second
place
these
ancestors
were
not
men
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
but
animals
or
vegetables
or
perhaps
mixed
beings
in
which
the
animal
or
vegetable
element
predominated
in
the
alcheringa
say
spencer
and
gillen
lived
ancestors
who
in
the
native
mind
are
so
intimately
associated
with
the
animals
or
plants
the
name
of
which
they
bear
that
an
alcheringa
man
of
say
the
kangaroo
totem
may
sometimes
be
spoken
of
either
as
a
or
a
the
identity
of
the
human
individual
is
often
sunk
in
that
of
the
animal
or
plant
from
which
he
is
supposed
to
have
originated
their
immortal
souls
necessarily
have
the
same
nature
in
them
also
the
human
element
is
wedded
to
the
animal
element
with
a
certain
tendency
for
the
latter
to
predominate
over
the
former
so
they
are
made
of
the
same
substance
as
the
totemic
principle
for
we
know
that
the
special
characteristic
of
this
is
to
present
this
double
nature
and
to
synthesize
and
confound
the
two
realms
in
itself
since
no
other
souls
than
these
exist
we
reach
the
conclusion
that
in
a
general
way
the
soul
is
nothing
other
than
the
totemic
principle
incarnate
in
each
individual
and
there
is
nothing
to
surprise
us
in
this
derivation
we
already
know
that
this
principle
is
immanent
in
each
of
the
members
of
the
clan
but
in
penetrating
into
these
individuals
it
must
inevitably
individualize
itself
because
the
consciousnesses
of
which
it
becomes
thus
an
integral
part
differ
from
each
other
it
differentiates
itself
according
to
their
image
since
each
has
its
own
physiognomy
it
takes
a
distinct
physiognomy
in
each
of
course
it
remains
something
outside
of
and
foreign
to
the
man
but
the
portion
of
it
which
each
is
believed
to
possess
can
not
fail
to
contract
close
affinities
with
the
particular
subject
in
which
it
resides
it
becomes
his
to
a
certain
extent
thus
it
has
two
contradictory
characteristics
but
whose
coexistence
is
one
of
the
distinctive
features
of
the
notion
of
the
soul
as
formerly
the
soul
is
what
is
best
and
most
profound
in
ourselves
and
the
part
of
our
being
yet
it
is
also
a
passing
guest
which
comes
from
the
outside
which
leads
in
us
an
existence
distinct
from
that
of
the
body
and
which
should
one
day
regain
its
entire
independence
in
a
word
just
as
society
exists
only
in
and
through
individuals
the
totemic
principle
exists
only
in
and
through
the
individual
consciousnesses
whose
association
forms
the
clan
if
they
did
not
feel
it
in
them
it
would
not
exist
it
is
they
who
put
it
into
things
so
it
must
of
necessity
be
divided
and
distributed
among
them
each
of
these
fragments
is
a
soul
a
myth
which
is
found
in
a
rather
large
number
of
the
societies
of
the
centre
and
which
moreover
is
only
a
particular
form
of
the
preceding
ones
shows
even
better
that
this
is
really
the
matter
out
of
which
the
idea
of
the
soul
is
made
in
these
tribes
tradition
puts
the
origin
of
each
clan
not
in
a
number
of
ancestors
but
in
only
two
or
even
in
one
this
unique
being
as
long
as
he
remained
single
contained
the
totemic
principle
within
him
integrally
for
at
this
moment
there
was
nothing
to
which
this
principle
could
be
communicated
now
according
to
this
same
tradition
all
the
human
souls
which
exist
both
those
which
now
animate
the
bodies
of
men
and
those
which
are
at
present
unemployed
being
held
in
reserve
for
the
future
have
issued
from
this
unique
personage
they
are
made
of
his
substance
while
travelling
over
the
surface
of
the
ground
or
moving
about
or
shaking
himself
he
made
them
leave
his
body
and
planted
them
in
the
various
places
he
is
believed
to
have
passed
over
is
this
not
merely
a
symbolic
way
of
saying
that
they
are
parts
of
the
totemic
divinity
but
this
conclusion
presupposes
that
the
tribes
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
admit
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
now
according
to
strehlow
this
doctrine
is
unknown
to
the
arunta
the
society
which
spencer
and
gillen
have
studied
the
longest
and
the
best
if
in
this
particular
case
these
two
observers
have
misunderstood
things
to
such
an
extent
their
whole
testimony
would
become
suspect
so
it
is
important
to
determine
the
actual
extent
of
this
divergence
according
to
strehlow
after
the
soul
has
once
been
definitely
freed
from
the
body
by
the
rites
of
mourning
it
never
reincarnates
itself
again
it
goes
off
to
the
isles
of
the
dead
where
it
passes
its
days
in
sleeping
and
its
nights
in
dancing
until
it
returns
again
to
earth
then
it
comes
back
into
the
midst
of
the
living
and
plays
the
rôle
of
protecting
genius
to
the
young
sons
or
if
such
are
lacking
to
the
grandsons
whom
the
dead
man
left
behind
him
it
enters
their
body
and
aids
their
growth
it
remains
thus
in
the
midst
of
its
former
family
for
a
year
or
two
after
which
it
goes
back
to
the
land
of
the
souls
but
after
a
certain
length
of
time
it
goes
away
once
more
to
make
another
sojourn
upon
earth
which
is
to
be
the
last
a
time
will
come
when
it
must
take
up
again
and
with
no
hope
of
return
this
time
the
route
to
the
isles
of
the
dead
then
after
various
incidents
the
details
of
which
it
is
useless
to
relate
a
storm
will
overtake
it
in
the
course
of
which
it
will
be
struck
by
a
flash
of
lightning
thus
its
career
is
definitely
terminated
so
it
can
not
reincarnate
itself
nor
can
conceptions
and
births
be
due
to
the
reincarnation
of
souls
which
periodically
commence
new
existences
in
new
bodies
it
is
true
that
strehlow
as
spencer
and
gillen
declares
that
for
the
arunta
commerce
of
the
sexes
is
in
no
way
the
determining
condition
of
generation
which
is
considered
the
result
of
mystic
operations
but
different
from
the
ones
which
the
other
observers
told
us
about
it
takes
place
in
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
following
ways
wherever
an
ancestor
of
the
alcheringa
times
is
believed
to
have
entered
into
the
ground
there
is
either
a
stone
or
a
tree
representing
his
body
the
tree
or
rock
which
has
this
mystic
relation
with
the
departed
hero
is
called
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
or
according
to
strehlow
sometimes
it
is
a
which
is
believed
to
have
been
formed
in
this
way
now
on
each
of
these
trees
or
rocks
and
in
each
of
these
there
live
embryo
children
called
which
belong
to
exactly
the
same
totem
as
the
corresponding
ancestor
for
example
on
a
representing
an
ancestor
of
the
kangaroo
totem
there
are
ratapa
all
of
which
have
the
kangaroo
as
their
totem
if
a
woman
happens
to
pass
it
and
she
is
of
the
matrimonial
class
to
which
the
mothers
of
these
ratapa
should
belong
one
of
them
may
enter
her
through
the
hip
the
woman
learns
of
this
act
by
the
characteristic
pains
which
are
the
first
symptoms
of
pregnancy
the
child
thus
conceived
will
of
course
belong
to
the
same
totem
as
the
ancestor
upon
whose
mystical
body
he
resided
before
becoming
incarnate
in
other
cases
the
process
employed
is
slightly
different
the
ancestor
himself
acts
in
person
at
a
given
moment
he
leaves
his
subterranean
retreat
and
throws
on
to
the
passing
woman
a
little
churinga
of
a
special
form
called
the
churinga
enters
the
body
of
the
woman
and
takes
a
human
form
there
while
the
ancestor
disappears
again
into
the
earth
these
two
ways
of
conception
are
believed
to
be
equally
frequent
the
features
of
the
child
will
reveal
the
manner
in
which
he
was
conceived
according
to
whether
his
face
is
broad
or
long
they
say
that
he
is
the
incarnation
of
a
ratapa
or
a
namatuna
beside
these
two
means
of
fecundation
strehlow
places
a
third
which
however
is
much
more
rare
after
his
namatuna
has
penetrated
into
the
body
of
the
woman
the
ancestor
himself
enters
her
and
voluntarily
submits
to
a
new
birth
so
in
this
case
the
conception
is
due
to
a
real
reincarnation
of
the
ancestor
but
this
is
very
exceptional
and
when
a
man
who
has
been
conceived
thus
dies
the
ancestral
soul
which
animated
him
goes
away
just
like
ordinary
souls
to
the
isles
of
the
dead
where
after
the
usual
delays
it
is
definitely
annihilated
so
it
can
not
undergo
any
further
reincarnations
such
is
the
version
of
strehlow
in
the
opinion
of
this
author
it
is
radically
opposed
to
that
of
spencer
and
gillen
but
in
reality
it
differs
only
in
the
letter
of
the
formulæ
and
symbols
while
in
both
cases
we
find
the
same
mythical
theme
in
slightly
different
forms
in
the
first
place
all
the
observers
agree
that
every
conception
is
the
result
of
an
incarnation
only
according
to
strehlow
that
which
is
incarnated
is
not
a
soul
but
a
ratapa
or
a
namatuna
but
what
is
a
ratapa
strehlow
says
that
it
is
a
complete
embryo
made
up
of
a
soul
and
a
body
but
the
soul
is
always
represented
in
material
forms
it
sleeps
dances
hunts
eats
etc
so
it
too
has
a
corporal
element
inversely
the
ratapa
is
invisible
to
ordinary
men
no
one
sees
it
as
it
enters
the
body
of
the
woman
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
it
is
made
of
a
matter
quite
similar
to
that
of
the
soul
so
it
hardly
seems
possible
to
differentiate
the
two
clearly
in
this
regard
in
reality
these
are
mythical
beings
which
are
obviously
conceived
after
the
same
model
schulze
calls
them
the
souls
of
children
moreover
the
ratapa
just
like
the
soul
sustains
the
closest
relations
with
the
ancestor
of
which
the
sacred
tree
or
rock
is
the
materialized
form
it
is
of
the
same
totem
as
this
ancestor
of
the
same
phratry
and
of
the
same
matrimonial
class
its
place
in
the
social
organization
of
the
tribe
is
the
very
one
that
its
ancestor
is
believed
to
have
held
before
it
it
bears
the
same
name
which
is
a
proof
that
these
two
personalities
are
at
least
very
closely
related
to
one
another
but
there
is
more
than
this
this
relationship
even
goes
as
far
as
a
complete
identification
in
fact
it
is
on
the
mystic
body
of
the
ancestor
that
the
ratapa
is
formed
it
comes
from
this
it
is
like
a
detached
portion
of
it
so
it
really
is
a
part
of
the
ancestor
which
penetrates
into
the
womb
of
the
mother
and
which
becomes
the
child
thus
we
get
back
to
the
conception
of
spencer
and
gillen
birth
is
due
to
the
reincarnation
of
an
ancestral
personage
of
course
it
is
not
the
entire
person
that
is
reincarnated
it
is
only
an
emanation
from
him
but
this
difference
has
only
a
secondary
interest
for
when
a
sacred
being
divides
and
duplicates
itself
all
of
its
essential
characteristics
are
to
be
found
again
in
each
of
the
fragments
into
which
it
is
broken
up
so
really
the
alcheringa
ancestor
is
entire
in
each
part
of
himself
which
becomes
a
ratapa
the
second
mode
of
conception
distinguished
by
strehlow
has
the
same
significance
in
fact
the
churinga
and
more
especially
the
particular
churinga
that
is
called
the
namatuna
is
considered
a
transformation
of
the
ancestor
according
to
strehlow
it
is
his
body
just
as
the
nanja
tree
is
in
other
words
the
personality
of
the
ancestor
his
churinga
and
his
nanja
tree
are
sacred
things
inspiring
the
same
sentiments
and
to
which
the
same
religious
value
is
attributed
so
they
transmute
themselves
into
one
another
in
the
spot
where
an
ancestor
lost
his
churinga
a
sacred
tree
or
rock
has
come
out
of
the
soil
just
the
same
as
in
those
places
where
he
entered
the
ground
himself
so
there
is
a
mythological
equivalence
of
a
person
of
the
alcheringa
and
his
churinga
consequently
when
the
former
throws
a
namatuna
into
the
body
of
a
woman
it
is
as
if
he
entered
into
it
himself
in
fact
we
have
seen
that
sometimes
he
does
enter
in
person
after
the
namatuna
according
to
other
stories
he
precedes
it
it
might
be
said
that
he
opens
up
the
way
for
it
the
fact
that
these
two
themes
exist
side
by
side
in
the
same
myth
completes
the
proof
that
one
is
only
a
doublet
of
the
other
moreover
in
whatever
way
the
conception
may
have
taken
place
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
each
individual
is
united
to
some
determined
ancestor
of
the
alcheringa
by
especially
close
bonds
in
the
first
place
each
man
has
his
appointed
ancestor
two
persons
can
not
have
the
same
one
simultaneously
in
other
words
a
being
of
the
alcheringa
never
has
more
than
one
representative
among
the
living
more
than
that
the
one
is
only
an
aspect
of
the
other
in
fact
as
we
already
know
the
churinga
left
by
the
ancestor
expresses
his
personality
if
we
adopt
the
interpretation
of
strehlow
which
perhaps
is
the
more
satisfactory
we
shall
say
that
it
is
his
body
but
this
same
churinga
is
related
in
the
same
way
to
the
individual
who
is
believed
to
have
been
conceived
under
the
influence
of
this
ancestor
and
who
is
the
fruit
of
his
mystic
works
when
the
young
initiate
is
introduced
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
clan
he
is
shown
the
churinga
of
his
ancestor
and
someone
says
to
him
you
are
this
body
you
are
the
same
thing
as
this
so
in
strehlow
own
expression
the
churinga
is
the
body
common
to
the
individual
and
his
ancestor
now
if
they
are
to
have
the
same
body
it
is
necessary
that
on
one
side
at
least
their
two
personalities
be
confounded
strehlow
recognizes
this
explicitly
moreover
when
he
says
by
the
tjurunga
churinga
the
individual
is
united
to
his
personal
ancestor
so
for
strehlow
as
well
as
for
spencer
and
gillen
there
is
a
mystic
religious
principle
in
each
child
which
emanates
from
an
ancestor
of
the
alcheringa
it
is
this
principle
which
forms
the
essence
of
each
individual
therefore
it
is
his
soul
or
in
any
case
the
soul
is
made
of
the
same
matter
and
the
same
substance
now
it
is
only
upon
this
one
fundamental
fact
that
we
have
relied
in
determining
the
nature
and
origin
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
the
different
metaphors
by
means
of
which
it
may
have
been
expressed
have
only
a
secondary
interest
for
us
far
from
contradicting
the
data
upon
which
our
theory
rests
the
recent
observations
of
strehlow
bring
new
proofs
confirming
it
our
reasoning
consisted
in
inferring
the
totemic
nature
of
the
human
soul
from
the
totemic
nature
of
the
ancestral
soul
of
which
the
former
is
an
emanation
and
a
sort
of
replica
now
some
of
the
new
facts
which
we
owe
to
strehlow
show
this
character
of
both
even
more
categorically
than
those
we
had
at
our
disposal
before
do
in
the
first
place
strehlow
like
spencer
and
gillen
insists
on
the
intimate
relations
uniting
each
ancestor
to
an
animal
to
a
plant
or
to
some
other
natural
object
some
of
these
altjirangamitjina
these
are
spencer
and
gillen
men
of
the
alcheringa
should
he
says
be
manifested
directly
as
animals
others
take
the
animal
form
in
a
way
even
now
they
are
constantly
transforming
themselves
into
animals
in
any
case
whatever
external
aspect
they
may
have
the
special
and
distinctive
qualities
of
the
animal
clearly
appear
in
each
of
them
for
example
the
ancestors
of
the
kangaroo
clan
eat
grass
just
like
real
kangaroos
and
flee
before
the
hunter
those
of
the
emu
clan
run
and
feed
like
emus
etc
more
than
that
those
ancestors
who
had
a
vegetable
as
totem
become
this
vegetable
itself
on
death
moreover
this
close
kinship
of
the
ancestor
and
the
totemic
being
is
so
keenly
felt
by
the
natives
that
it
is
shown
even
in
their
terminology
among
the
arunta
the
child
calls
the
totem
of
his
mother
which
serves
him
as
a
secondary
totem
as
filiation
was
at
first
in
the
uterine
line
there
was
once
a
time
when
each
individual
had
no
other
totem
than
that
of
his
mother
so
it
is
very
probable
that
the
term
then
designated
the
real
totem
now
this
clearly
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
word
which
means
great
ancestor
the
idea
of
the
totem
and
that
of
the
ancestor
are
even
so
closely
kindred
that
they
sometimes
seem
to
be
confounded
thus
after
speaking
of
the
totem
of
the
mother
or
strehlow
goes
on
to
say
this
altjira
appears
to
the
natives
in
dreams
and
gives
them
warnings
just
as
it
takes
information
concerning
them
to
their
sleeping
friends
this
which
speaks
and
which
is
attached
to
each
individual
personally
is
evidently
an
ancestor
yet
it
is
also
an
incarnation
of
the
totem
a
certain
text
in
roth
which
speaks
of
invocations
addressed
to
the
totem
should
certainly
be
interpreted
in
this
sense
so
it
appears
that
the
totem
is
sometimes
represented
in
the
mind
in
the
form
of
a
group
of
ideal
beings
or
mythical
personages
who
are
more
or
less
indistinct
from
the
ancestors
in
a
word
the
ancestors
are
the
fragments
of
the
totem
but
if
the
ancestor
is
so
readily
confused
with
the
totemic
being
the
individual
soul
which
is
so
near
the
ancestral
soul
can
not
do
otherwise
moreover
this
is
what
actually
results
from
the
close
union
of
each
man
with
his
churinga
in
fact
we
know
that
the
churinga
represents
the
personality
of
the
individual
who
is
believed
to
have
been
born
of
it
but
it
also
expresses
the
totemic
animal
when
the
civilizing
hero
mangarkunjerkunja
presented
each
member
of
the
kangaroo
clan
with
his
personal
totem
he
spoke
as
follows
here
is
the
body
of
a
kangaroo
thus
the
churinga
is
at
once
the
body
of
the
ancestor
of
the
individual
himself
and
of
the
totemic
animal
so
according
to
a
strong
and
very
just
expression
of
strehlow
these
three
beings
form
a
solid
unity
they
are
almost
equivalent
and
interchangeable
terms
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
they
are
thought
of
as
different
aspects
of
one
and
the
same
reality
which
is
also
defined
by
the
distinctive
attributes
of
the
totem
their
common
essence
is
the
totemic
principle
the
language
itself
expresses
this
identity
the
word
ratapa
and
the
of
the
loritja
language
designate
the
mythical
embryo
which
is
detached
from
the
ancestor
and
which
becomes
the
child
now
these
same
words
also
designate
the
totem
of
this
same
child
such
as
is
determined
by
the
spot
where
the
mother
believes
that
she
conceived
iii
up
to
the
present
we
have
studied
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
only
in
the
tribes
of
central
australia
therefore
the
bases
upon
which
our
inference
rests
may
be
deemed
too
narrow
but
in
the
first
place
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
pointed
out
the
experiment
holds
good
outside
of
the
societies
which
we
have
observed
directly
also
there
are
abundant
facts
proving
that
the
same
or
analogous
conceptions
are
found
in
the
most
diverse
parts
of
australia
or
at
least
have
left
very
evident
traces
there
they
are
found
even
in
america
howitt
mentions
them
among
the
dieri
of
south
australia
the
word
which
gason
translates
with
good
spirit
and
which
he
thinks
expresses
a
belief
in
a
god
creator
is
really
a
collective
word
designating
the
group
of
ancestors
placed
by
the
myth
at
the
beginning
of
the
tribe
they
continue
to
exist
as
formerly
they
are
believed
to
live
in
trees
which
are
sacred
for
this
reason
certain
irregularities
of
the
ground
rocks
and
springs
are
identified
with
these
which
consequently
resemble
the
altjirangamitjina
of
the
arunta
in
a
singular
way
the
kurnai
of
gippsland
though
retaining
only
vestiges
of
totemism
also
believe
in
the
existence
of
ancestors
called
and
which
they
think
of
as
beings
intermediate
between
men
and
animals
among
the
nimbaldi
taplin
has
observed
a
theory
of
conception
similar
to
that
which
strehlow
attributes
to
the
arunta
we
find
this
belief
in
reincarnation
held
integrally
by
the
wotjobaluk
in
victoria
the
spirits
of
the
dead
says
mathews
assemble
in
the
of
their
respective
clans
they
leave
these
to
be
born
again
in
human
form
when
a
favourable
occasion
presents
itself
mathews
even
affirms
that
the
belief
in
the
reincarnation
or
transmigration
of
souls
is
strongly
enrooted
in
all
the
australian
tribes
if
we
pass
to
the
northern
regions
we
find
the
pure
doctrine
of
the
arunta
among
the
in
the
every
birth
is
attributed
to
the
incarnation
of
a
soul
which
introduces
itself
into
the
body
of
a
woman
in
northern
queensland
myths
differing
from
the
preceding
only
in
form
express
exactly
the
same
ideas
among
the
tribes
on
the
pennefather
river
it
is
believed
that
every
man
has
two
souls
the
one
called
resides
in
the
heart
the
other
called
remains
in
the
placenta
soon
after
birth
the
placenta
is
buried
in
a
consecrated
place
a
particular
genius
named
who
has
charge
of
the
phenomena
of
procreation
comes
to
get
this
and
keeps
it
until
the
child
being
grown
up
is
married
when
the
time
comes
to
give
him
a
son
takes
a
bit
of
the
choi
of
this
man
places
it
in
the
embryo
he
is
making
and
inserts
it
into
the
womb
of
the
mother
so
it
is
out
of
the
soul
of
the
father
that
that
of
the
child
is
made
it
is
true
that
the
child
does
not
receive
the
paternal
soul
integrally
at
first
for
the
remains
in
the
heart
of
the
father
as
long
as
he
lives
but
when
he
dies
the
being
liberated
also
incarnates
itself
in
the
bodies
of
the
children
if
there
are
several
children
it
is
divided
equally
among
them
thus
there
is
a
perfect
spiritual
continuity
between
the
generations
it
is
the
same
soul
which
is
transmitted
from
a
father
to
his
children
and
from
these
to
their
children
and
this
unique
soul
always
remaining
itself
in
spite
of
its
successive
divisions
and
subdivisions
is
the
one
which
animated
the
first
ancestor
at
the
beginning
of
all
things
between
this
theory
and
the
one
held
by
the
central
tribes
there
is
only
one
difference
of
any
importance
this
is
that
the
reincarnation
is
not
the
work
of
the
ancestors
themselves
but
that
of
a
special
genius
who
takes
charge
of
this
function
professionally
but
it
seems
probable
that
this
genius
is
the
product
of
a
syncretism
which
has
fused
the
numerous
figures
of
the
first
ancestors
into
one
single
being
this
hypothesis
is
at
least
made
probable
by
the
fact
that
the
words
and
anjir
are
evidently
very
closely
related
now
the
second
designates
the
first
man
the
original
ancestor
from
whom
all
men
are
descended
these
same
ideas
are
found
again
among
the
indian
tribes
of
america
krauss
says
that
among
the
tlinkit
the
souls
of
the
departed
are
believed
to
come
back
to
earth
and
introduce
themselves
into
the
bodies
of
the
pregnant
women
of
their
families
so
when
a
woman
dreams
during
pregnancy
of
some
deceased
relative
she
believes
that
the
soul
of
this
latter
has
penetrated
into
her
if
the
young
child
has
some
characteristic
mark
which
the
dead
man
had
before
they
believe
that
it
is
the
dead
man
himself
come
back
to
earth
and
his
name
is
given
to
the
child
this
belief
is
also
general
among
the
haida
it
is
the
shaman
who
reveals
which
relative
it
was
who
reincarnated
himself
in
the
child
and
what
name
should
consequently
be
given
to
him
among
the
kwakiutl
it
is
believed
that
the
latest
member
of
a
family
who
died
comes
back
to
life
in
the
person
of
the
first
child
to
be
born
in
that
family
it
is
the
same
with
the
hurons
the
iroquois
the
tinneh
and
many
other
tribes
of
the
united
states
the
universality
of
these
conceptions
extends
of
course
to
the
conclusion
which
we
have
deduced
from
them
that
is
to
the
explanation
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
which
we
have
proposed
its
general
acceptability
is
also
proved
by
the
following
facts
we
know
that
each
individual
contains
within
him
something
of
that
anonymous
force
which
is
diffused
in
the
sacred
species
he
is
a
member
of
this
species
himself
but
as
an
empirical
and
visible
being
he
is
not
for
in
spite
of
the
symbolic
designs
and
marks
with
which
he
decorates
his
body
there
is
nothing
in
him
to
suggest
the
form
of
an
animal
or
plant
so
it
must
be
that
there
is
another
being
in
him
in
whom
he
recognizes
himself
but
whom
he
represents
in
the
form
of
an
animal
or
vegetable
species
now
is
it
not
evident
that
this
double
can
only
be
the
soul
since
the
soul
is
of
itself
already
a
double
of
the
subject
whom
it
animates
the
justification
of
this
identification
is
completed
by
the
fact
that
the
organs
where
the
fragment
of
the
totemic
principle
contained
in
each
individual
incarnates
itself
the
most
eminently
are
also
those
where
the
soul
resides
this
is
the
case
with
the
blood
the
blood
contains
something
of
the
nature
of
the
totem
as
is
proved
by
the
part
it
takes
in
the
totemic
ceremonies
but
at
the
same
time
the
blood
is
one
of
the
seats
of
the
soul
or
rather
it
is
the
soul
itself
seen
from
without
when
blood
flows
life
runs
out
and
in
the
same
process
the
soul
escapes
so
the
soul
is
confused
with
the
sacred
principle
which
is
imminent
in
the
blood
regarding
matters
from
another
point
of
view
if
our
explanation
is
the
totemic
principle
in
penetrating
into
the
individual
as
we
suppose
should
retain
a
certain
amount
of
autonomy
there
since
it
is
quite
distinct
from
the
subject
in
whom
it
is
incarnated
now
this
is
just
what
howitt
claims
to
have
observed
among
the
yuin
that
in
this
tribe
the
totem
is
thought
to
be
in
some
way
part
of
a
man
is
clearly
seen
by
the
case
of
umbara
before
mentioned
who
told
me
that
many
years
ago
someone
of
the
totem
sent
it
while
he
was
asleep
and
that
it
went
down
his
throat
and
almost
ate
his
totem
which
was
in
his
breast
so
that
he
nearly
died
so
it
is
quite
true
that
the
totem
is
broken
up
in
individualizing
itself
and
that
each
of
the
bits
thus
detached
plays
the
part
of
a
spirit
or
soul
residing
in
the
body
but
there
are
other
more
clearly
demonstrative
facts
if
the
soul
is
only
the
totemic
principle
individualized
it
should
have
in
certain
cases
at
least
rather
close
relations
with
the
animal
or
vegetable
species
whose
form
is
reproduced
by
the
totem
and
in
fact
the
a
tribe
of
new
south
wales
had
a
superstition
that
everyone
had
within
himself
an
affinity
to
the
spirit
of
some
bird
beast
or
reptile
not
that
he
sprung
from
the
creature
in
any
way
but
that
the
spirit
which
was
in
him
was
akin
to
that
of
the
creature
there
are
even
cases
where
the
soul
is
believed
to
emanate
directly
from
the
animal
or
vegetable
serving
as
totem
among
the
arunta
according
to
strehlow
when
a
woman
has
eaten
a
great
deal
of
fruit
it
is
believed
that
she
will
give
birth
to
a
child
who
will
have
this
fruit
as
totem
if
at
the
moment
when
she
felt
the
first
tremblings
of
the
child
she
was
looking
at
a
kangaroo
it
is
believed
that
the
ratapa
of
the
kangaroo
has
entered
her
body
and
fertilized
her
basedow
reported
the
same
fact
from
the
wogait
we
know
also
that
the
ratapa
and
the
soul
are
almost
indistinguishable
things
now
such
an
origin
could
never
have
been
attributed
to
the
soul
if
men
did
not
think
that
it
was
made
out
of
the
same
substances
as
the
plants
and
animals
of
the
totemic
species
thus
the
soul
is
frequently
represented
in
an
animal
form
it
is
known
that
in
inferior
societies
death
is
never
considered
a
natural
event
due
to
the
action
of
purely
physical
causes
it
is
generally
attributed
to
the
evil
workings
of
some
sorcerer
in
a
large
number
of
australian
societies
in
order
to
determine
who
is
the
responsible
author
of
this
murder
they
work
on
the
principle
that
the
soul
of
the
murderer
must
inevitably
come
to
visit
its
victim
therefore
the
body
is
placed
upon
a
scaffolding
then
the
ground
under
the
corpse
and
all
around
it
is
carefully
smoothed
off
so
that
the
slightest
mark
becomes
easily
perceptible
they
return
the
next
day
if
an
animal
has
passed
by
there
during
the
interval
its
tracks
are
readily
recognizable
their
form
reveals
the
species
to
which
it
belongs
and
from
that
they
infer
the
social
group
of
which
the
guilty
man
is
a
member
they
say
that
it
is
a
man
of
such
a
class
or
such
a
clan
according
to
whether
the
animal
is
the
totem
of
this
or
that
class
or
clan
so
the
soul
is
believed
to
have
come
in
the
form
of
the
totemic
animal
in
other
societies
where
totemism
has
weakened
or
disappeared
the
soul
still
continues
to
be
thought
of
in
an
animal
form
the
natives
of
cape
bedford
north
queensland
believe
that
the
child
at
the
moment
of
entering
the
body
of
its
mother
is
a
curlew
if
it
is
a
girl
or
a
snake
if
it
is
a
boy
it
is
only
later
that
it
takes
a
human
form
many
of
the
indians
of
north
america
says
the
prince
of
wied
say
that
they
have
an
animal
in
their
bodies
the
bororo
of
brazil
represent
the
soul
in
the
form
of
a
bird
and
therefore
believe
that
they
are
birds
of
the
same
variety
in
other
places
it
is
thought
of
as
a
snake
a
lizard
a
fly
a
bee
etc
but
it
is
especially
after
death
that
this
animal
nature
of
the
soul
is
manifested
during
life
this
characteristic
is
partially
veiled
as
it
were
by
the
very
form
of
the
human
body
but
when
death
has
once
set
it
free
it
becomes
itself
again
among
the
omaha
in
at
least
two
of
the
buffalo
clans
it
is
believed
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
go
to
rejoin
the
buffalo
their
ancestors
the
hopi
are
divided
into
a
certain
number
of
clans
whose
ancestors
were
animals
or
beings
with
animal
forms
now
schoolcraft
tells
us
that
they
say
that
at
death
they
take
their
original
form
again
each
becomes
a
bear
or
deer
according
to
the
clan
to
which
he
belongs
very
frequently
the
soul
is
believed
to
reincarnate
itself
in
the
body
of
an
animal
it
is
probably
from
this
that
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
was
derived
we
have
already
seen
how
hard
pressed
tylor
is
to
account
for
it
if
the
soul
is
an
essentially
human
principle
what
could
be
more
curious
than
this
marked
predilection
which
it
shows
in
so
large
a
number
of
societies
for
the
animal
form
on
the
other
hand
everything
is
explained
if
by
its
very
constitution
the
soul
is
closely
related
to
the
animal
for
in
that
case
when
it
returns
to
the
animal
world
at
the
close
of
this
life
it
is
only
returning
to
its
real
nature
thus
the
generality
of
the
belief
in
metempsychosis
is
a
new
proof
that
the
constituent
elements
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
have
been
taken
largely
from
the
animal
kingdom
as
is
presupposed
by
the
theory
which
we
have
just
set
forth
iv
thus
the
notion
of
the
soul
is
a
particular
application
of
the
beliefs
relative
to
sacred
beings
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
religious
character
which
this
idea
has
had
from
the
moment
when
it
first
appeared
in
history
and
which
it
still
retains
in
fact
the
soul
has
always
been
considered
a
sacred
thing
on
this
ground
it
is
opposed
to
the
body
which
is
in
itself
profane
it
is
not
merely
distinguished
from
its
material
envelope
as
the
inside
from
the
outside
it
is
not
merely
represented
as
made
out
of
a
more
subtle
and
fluid
matter
but
more
than
this
it
inspires
those
sentiments
which
are
everywhere
reserved
for
that
which
is
divine
if
it
is
not
made
into
a
god
it
is
at
least
regarded
as
a
spark
of
the
divinity
this
essential
characteristic
would
be
inexplicable
if
the
idea
of
the
soul
were
only
a
solution
given
to
the
problem
of
dreams
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
dream
to
awaken
religious
emotions
so
the
cause
by
which
these
are
explained
could
not
have
such
a
character
but
if
the
soul
is
a
part
of
the
divine
substance
it
represents
something
not
ourselves
that
is
within
us
if
it
is
made
of
the
same
mental
matter
as
the
sacred
beings
it
is
natural
that
it
should
become
the
object
of
the
same
sentiments
and
the
sacred
character
which
men
thus
attribute
to
themselves
is
not
the
product
of
a
pure
illusion
either
like
the
notions
of
religious
force
and
of
divinity
the
notion
of
the
soul
is
not
without
a
foundation
in
reality
it
is
perfectly
true
that
we
are
made
up
of
two
distinct
parts
which
are
opposed
to
one
another
as
the
sacred
to
the
profane
and
we
may
say
that
in
a
certain
sense
there
is
divinity
in
us
for
society
this
unique
source
of
all
that
is
sacred
does
not
limit
itself
to
moving
us
from
without
and
affecting
us
for
the
moment
it
establishes
itself
within
us
in
a
durable
manner
it
arouses
within
us
a
whole
world
of
ideas
and
sentiments
which
express
it
but
which
at
the
same
time
form
an
integral
and
permanent
part
of
ourselves
when
the
australian
goes
away
from
a
religious
ceremony
the
representations
which
this
communal
life
has
aroused
or
within
him
are
not
obliterated
in
a
second
the
figures
of
the
great
ancestors
the
heroic
exploits
whose
memory
these
rites
perpetuate
the
great
deeds
of
every
sort
in
which
he
too
has
participated
through
the
cult
in
a
word
all
these
numerous
ideals
which
he
has
elaborated
with
the
of
his
fellows
continue
to
live
in
his
consciousness
and
through
the
emotions
which
are
attached
to
them
and
the
ascendancy
which
they
hold
over
his
entire
being
they
are
sharply
distinguished
from
the
vulgar
impressions
arising
from
his
daily
relations
with
external
things
moral
ideas
have
the
same
character
it
is
society
which
forces
them
upon
us
and
as
the
respect
inspired
by
it
is
naturally
extended
to
all
that
comes
from
it
its
imperative
rules
of
conduct
are
invested
by
reason
of
their
origin
with
an
authority
and
a
dignity
which
is
shared
by
none
of
our
internal
states
therefore
we
assign
them
a
place
apart
in
our
psychical
life
although
our
moral
conscience
is
a
part
of
our
consciousness
we
do
not
feel
ourselves
on
an
equality
with
it
in
this
voice
which
makes
itself
heard
only
to
give
us
orders
and
establish
prohibitions
we
can
not
recognize
our
own
voices
the
very
tone
in
which
it
speaks
to
us
warns
us
that
it
expresses
something
within
us
that
is
not
of
ourselves
this
is
the
objective
foundation
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
those
representations
whose
flow
constitutes
our
interior
life
are
of
two
different
species
which
are
irreducible
one
into
another
some
concern
themselves
with
the
external
and
material
world
others
with
an
ideal
world
to
which
we
attribute
a
moral
superiority
over
the
first
so
we
are
really
made
up
of
two
beings
facing
in
different
and
almost
contrary
directions
one
of
whom
exercises
a
real
over
the
other
such
is
the
profound
meaning
of
the
antithesis
which
all
men
have
more
or
less
clearly
conceived
between
the
body
and
the
soul
the
material
and
the
spiritual
beings
who
coexist
within
us
moralists
and
preachers
have
often
maintained
that
no
one
can
deny
the
reality
of
duty
and
its
sacred
character
without
falling
into
materialism
and
it
is
true
that
if
we
have
no
idea
of
moral
and
religious
imperatives
our
psychical
life
will
all
be
reduced
to
one
level
all
our
states
of
consciousness
will
be
on
the
same
plane
and
all
feeling
of
duality
will
perish
to
make
this
duality
intelligible
it
is
of
course
in
no
way
necessary
to
imagine
a
mysterious
and
unrepresentable
substance
under
the
name
of
the
soul
which
is
opposed
to
the
body
but
here
as
in
regard
to
the
idea
of
sacredness
the
error
concerns
the
letter
of
the
symbol
employed
not
the
reality
of
the
fact
symbolized
it
remains
true
that
our
nature
is
double
there
really
is
a
particle
of
divinity
in
us
because
there
is
within
us
us
a
particle
of
these
great
ideas
which
are
the
soul
of
the
group
so
the
individual
soul
is
only
a
portion
of
the
collective
soul
of
the
group
it
is
the
anonymous
force
at
the
basis
of
the
cult
but
incarnated
in
an
individual
whose
personality
it
espouses
it
is
individualized
perhaps
dreams
aided
in
determining
certain
secondary
characteristics
of
the
idea
the
inconsistency
and
instability
of
the
images
which
fill
our
minds
during
sleep
and
their
remarkable
aptitude
for
transforming
themselves
into
one
another
may
have
furnished
the
model
for
this
subtile
transparent
and
protean
matter
out
of
which
the
soul
is
believed
to
be
made
also
the
facts
of
swooning
catalepsy
may
have
suggested
the
idea
that
the
soul
was
mobile
and
quitted
the
body
temporarily
during
this
life
this
in
its
turn
has
served
to
explain
certain
dreams
but
all
these
experiences
and
observations
could
have
had
only
a
secondary
and
complimentary
influence
whose
very
existence
it
is
difficult
to
establish
all
that
is
really
essential
in
the
idea
comes
from
elsewhere
but
does
not
this
genesis
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
misunderstand
its
essential
characteristic
if
the
soul
is
a
particular
form
of
the
impersonal
principle
which
is
diffused
in
the
group
the
totemic
species
and
all
the
things
of
every
sort
which
are
attached
to
these
at
bottom
it
is
impersonal
itself
so
with
differences
only
of
degree
it
should
have
the
same
properties
as
the
force
of
which
it
is
a
special
form
and
particularly
the
same
diffusion
the
same
aptitude
for
spreading
itself
contagiously
and
the
same
ubiquity
but
quite
on
the
contrary
the
soul
is
voluntarily
represented
as
a
concrete
definite
being
wholly
contained
within
itself
and
not
communicable
to
others
it
is
made
the
basis
of
our
personality
but
this
way
of
conceiving
the
soul
is
the
product
of
a
late
and
philosophic
elaboration
the
popular
representation
as
it
is
spontaneously
formed
from
common
experience
is
very
different
especially
at
first
for
the
australian
the
soul
is
a
very
vague
thing
undecided
and
wavering
in
form
and
spread
over
the
whole
organism
though
it
manifests
itself
especially
at
certain
points
there
are
probably
none
from
which
it
is
totally
absent
so
it
has
a
diffusion
a
contagiousness
and
an
omnipresence
comparable
to
those
of
the
like
the
mana
it
is
able
to
divide
and
duplicate
itself
infinitely
though
remaining
entire
in
each
of
its
parts
it
is
from
these
divisions
and
duplications
that
the
plurality
of
souls
is
derived
on
the
other
hand
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
whose
generality
we
have
established
shows
how
many
impersonal
elements
enter
into
the
idea
of
the
soul
and
how
essential
those
are
for
if
the
same
soul
is
going
to
clothe
a
new
personality
in
each
generation
the
individual
forms
in
which
it
successively
develops
itself
must
all
be
equally
external
to
it
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
true
nature
it
is
a
sort
of
generic
substance
which
individualizes
itself
only
secondarily
and
superficially
moreover
this
conception
of
the
soul
is
by
no
means
completely
gone
the
cult
of
relics
shows
that
for
a
host
of
believers
even
the
soul
of
a
saint
with
all
its
essential
powers
continues
to
adhere
to
his
different
bones
and
this
implies
that
he
is
believed
to
be
able
to
diffuse
himself
subdivide
himself
and
incorporate
himself
in
all
sorts
of
different
things
simultaneously
just
as
the
characteristic
attributes
of
the
mana
are
found
in
the
soul
so
secondary
and
superficial
changes
are
enough
to
enable
the
mana
to
individualize
itself
in
the
form
of
a
soul
we
pass
from
the
first
idea
to
the
second
with
no
break
of
continuity
every
religious
force
which
is
attached
in
a
special
way
to
a
determined
being
participates
in
the
characteristics
of
this
being
takes
on
its
appearance
and
becomes
its
spiritual
double
tregear
in
his
dictionary
has
thought
it
possible
to
connect
the
word
with
another
group
of
words
such
as
which
seem
to
belong
to
the
same
family
and
which
signify
heart
life
consciousness
is
this
not
equivalent
to
saying
that
some
sort
of
kinship
ought
to
exist
between
the
corresponding
ideas
as
well
that
is
to
say
between
the
idea
of
impersonal
force
and
those
of
internal
life
mental
force
and
in
a
word
of
the
soul
this
is
why
the
question
whether
the
churinga
is
sacred
because
it
serves
as
the
residence
of
a
soul
as
spencer
and
gillen
believe
or
because
it
has
impersonal
virtues
as
strehlow
thinks
seems
to
us
to
have
little
interest
and
to
be
without
sociological
importance
whether
the
efficacy
of
a
sacred
object
is
represented
in
an
abstract
form
in
the
mind
or
is
attributed
to
some
personal
agent
does
not
really
matter
the
psychological
roots
of
both
beliefs
are
identical
an
object
is
sacred
because
it
inspires
in
one
way
or
another
a
collective
sentiment
of
respect
which
removes
it
from
profane
touches
in
order
to
explain
this
sentiment
men
sometimes
fall
back
on
to
a
vague
and
imprecise
cause
and
sometimes
on
to
a
determined
spiritual
being
endowed
with
a
name
and
a
history
but
these
different
interpretations
are
superadded
to
one
fundamental
phenomenon
which
is
the
same
in
both
cases
this
moreover
is
what
explains
the
singular
confusions
examples
of
which
we
have
met
with
as
we
have
progressed
the
individual
the
soul
of
the
ancestor
which
he
reincarnates
or
from
which
his
own
is
an
emanation
his
churinga
and
the
animals
of
the
totemic
species
are
as
we
have
said
partially
equivalent
and
interchangeable
things
this
is
because
in
certain
connections
they
all
affect
the
collective
consciousness
in
the
same
way
if
the
churinga
is
sacred
it
is
because
of
the
collective
sentiments
of
respect
inspired
by
the
totemic
emblem
carved
upon
its
surface
now
the
same
sentiment
attaches
itself
to
the
animals
or
plants
whose
outward
form
is
reproduced
by
the
totem
to
the
soul
of
the
individual
for
it
is
thought
of
in
the
form
of
the
totemic
being
and
finally
to
the
ancestral
soul
of
which
the
preceding
one
is
only
a
particular
aspect
so
all
these
various
objects
whether
real
or
ideal
have
one
common
element
by
which
they
arouse
a
single
affective
state
in
the
mind
and
through
this
they
become
confused
in
so
far
as
they
are
expressed
by
one
and
the
same
representation
they
are
indistinct
this
is
how
the
arunta
has
come
to
regard
the
churinga
as
the
body
common
to
the
individual
the
ancestor
and
even
the
totemic
being
it
is
his
way
of
expressing
the
identity
of
the
sentiments
of
which
these
different
things
are
the
object
however
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
the
idea
of
the
soul
is
derived
from
the
idea
of
mana
that
the
first
has
a
relatively
later
origin
or
that
there
was
a
period
in
history
when
men
were
acquainted
with
religious
forces
only
in
their
impersonal
forms
when
some
wish
to
designate
by
the
word
preanimist
an
historical
period
during
which
animism
was
completely
unknown
they
build
up
an
arbitrary
hypothesis
for
there
is
no
people
among
whom
the
ideas
of
the
soul
and
of
mana
do
not
coexist
side
by
side
so
there
is
no
ground
for
imagining
that
they
were
formed
at
two
distinct
times
everything
on
the
contrary
goes
to
show
that
the
two
are
coeval
just
as
there
is
no
society
without
individuals
so
those
impersonal
forces
which
are
disengaged
from
the
group
can
not
establish
themselves
without
incarnating
themselves
in
the
individual
consciousnesses
where
they
individualize
themselves
in
reality
we
do
not
have
two
different
developments
but
two
different
aspects
of
one
and
the
same
development
it
is
true
that
they
do
not
have
an
equal
importance
one
is
more
essential
than
the
other
the
idea
of
mana
does
not
presuppose
the
idea
of
the
soul
for
if
the
mana
is
going
to
individualize
itself
and
break
itself
up
into
the
particular
souls
it
must
first
of
all
exist
and
what
it
is
in
itself
does
not
depend
upon
the
forms
it
takes
when
individualized
but
on
the
contrary
the
idea
of
the
soul
can
not
be
understood
except
when
taken
in
connection
with
the
idea
of
mana
so
on
this
ground
it
is
possible
to
say
that
it
is
the
result
of
a
secondary
formation
but
we
are
speaking
of
a
secondary
formation
in
the
logical
not
the
chronological
sense
of
the
word
v
but
how
does
it
come
that
men
have
believed
that
the
soul
survives
the
body
and
is
even
able
to
do
so
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
from
the
analysis
which
we
have
made
it
is
evident
that
the
belief
in
immortality
has
not
been
established
under
the
influence
of
moral
ideas
men
have
not
imagined
the
prolongation
of
their
existence
beyond
the
tomb
in
order
that
a
just
retribution
for
moral
acts
may
be
assured
in
another
life
if
it
fails
in
this
one
for
we
have
seen
that
all
considerations
of
this
sort
are
foreign
to
the
primitive
conception
of
the
beyond
nor
is
the
other
hypothesis
any
better
according
to
which
the
other
life
was
imagined
as
a
means
of
escaping
the
agonizing
prospect
of
annihilation
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
true
that
the
need
of
personal
survival
was
actively
felt
at
the
beginning
the
primitive
generally
accepts
the
idea
of
death
with
a
sort
of
indifference
being
trained
to
count
his
own
individuality
for
little
and
being
accustomed
to
exposing
his
life
constantly
he
gives
it
up
easily
enough
more
than
that
the
immortality
promised
by
the
religions
he
practices
is
not
personal
in
a
large
number
of
cases
the
soul
does
not
continue
the
personality
of
the
dead
man
or
does
not
continue
it
long
for
forgetful
of
its
previous
existence
it
goes
away
after
a
while
to
animate
another
body
and
thus
becomes
the
vivifying
principle
of
a
new
personality
even
among
the
most
advanced
peoples
it
was
only
a
pale
and
sad
existence
that
shades
led
in
sheol
or
erebus
and
could
hardly
attenuate
the
regrets
occasioned
by
the
memories
of
the
life
lost
a
more
satisfactory
explanation
is
the
one
attaching
the
conception
of
a
posthumous
life
to
the
experiences
of
dreams
our
dead
friends
and
relatives
reappear
to
us
in
dreams
we
see
them
act
we
hear
them
speak
it
is
natural
to
conclude
that
they
continue
to
exist
but
if
these
observations
were
able
to
confirm
the
idea
after
it
had
once
been
born
they
hardly
seem
capable
of
creating
it
out
of
nothing
dreams
in
which
we
see
departed
persons
living
again
are
too
rare
and
too
short
and
leave
only
too
vague
recollections
of
themselves
to
have
been
able
to
suggest
so
important
a
system
of
beliefs
to
men
all
by
themselves
there
is
a
remarkable
lack
of
proportion
between
the
effect
and
the
cause
to
which
it
is
attributed
what
makes
this
question
embarrassing
is
the
fact
that
in
itself
the
idea
of
the
soul
does
not
imply
that
of
its
survival
but
rather
seems
to
exclude
it
in
fact
we
have
seen
that
the
soul
though
being
distinguished
from
the
body
is
believed
nevertheless
to
be
closely
united
to
it
it
ages
along
with
the
body
it
feels
a
reaction
from
all
the
maladies
that
fall
upon
the
body
so
it
would
seem
natural
that
it
should
die
with
the
body
at
least
men
ought
to
have
believed
that
it
ceased
to
exist
from
the
moment
when
it
definitely
lost
its
original
form
and
when
it
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been
yet
it
is
at
just
this
moment
that
a
new
life
opens
out
before
it
the
myths
which
we
have
already
described
give
the
only
possible
explanation
of
this
belief
we
have
seen
that
the
souls
of
children
are
either
emanations
of
the
ancestral
souls
or
these
souls
themselves
reincarnated
but
in
order
that
they
may
either
reincarnate
themselves
or
periodically
give
off
new
emanations
they
must
have
survived
their
first
holders
so
it
seems
as
though
they
admitted
the
survival
of
the
dead
in
order
to
explain
the
birth
of
the
living
the
primitive
does
not
have
the
idea
of
an
god
who
creates
souls
out
of
nothing
it
seems
to
him
that
souls
can
not
be
made
except
out
of
souls
so
those
who
are
born
can
only
be
new
forms
of
those
who
have
been
consequently
it
is
necessary
that
these
latter
continue
to
exist
in
order
that
others
may
be
born
in
fine
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
the
only
way
in
which
men
were
able
to
explain
a
fact
which
could
not
fail
to
attract
their
attention
this
fact
is
the
perpetuity
of
the
life
of
the
group
individuals
die
but
the
clan
survives
so
the
forces
which
give
it
life
must
have
the
same
perpetuity
now
these
forces
are
the
souls
which
animate
individual
bodies
for
it
is
in
them
and
through
them
that
the
group
is
realized
for
this
reason
it
is
necessary
that
they
endure
it
is
even
necessary
that
in
enduring
they
remain
always
the
same
for
as
the
clan
always
keeps
its
characteristic
appearance
the
spiritual
substance
out
of
which
it
is
made
must
be
thought
of
as
qualitatively
invariable
since
it
is
always
the
same
clan
with
the
same
totemic
principle
it
is
necessary
that
the
souls
be
the
same
for
souls
are
only
the
totemic
principle
broken
up
and
particularized
thus
there
is
something
like
a
germinative
plasm
of
a
mystic
order
which
is
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
and
which
makes
or
at
least
is
believed
to
make
the
spiritual
unity
of
the
clan
through
all
time
and
this
belief
in
spite
of
its
symbolic
character
is
not
without
a
certain
objective
truth
for
though
the
group
may
not
be
immortal
in
the
absolute
sense
of
the
word
still
it
is
true
that
it
endures
longer
than
the
individuals
and
that
it
is
born
and
incarnated
afresh
in
each
new
generation
a
fact
confirms
this
interpretation
we
have
seen
that
according
to
the
testimony
of
strehlow
the
arunta
distinguish
two
sorts
of
souls
on
the
one
hand
are
those
of
the
ancestors
of
the
alcheringa
on
the
other
those
of
the
individuals
who
actually
compose
the
active
body
of
the
tribe
at
each
moment
in
history
the
second
sort
only
survive
the
body
for
a
relatively
short
time
they
are
soon
totally
annihilated
only
the
former
are
immortal
as
they
are
uncreated
so
they
do
not
perish
it
is
also
to
be
noticed
that
they
are
the
only
ones
whose
immortality
is
necessary
to
explain
the
permanence
of
the
group
for
it
is
upon
them
and
upon
them
alone
that
it
is
incumbent
to
assure
the
perpetuity
of
the
clan
for
every
conception
is
their
work
in
this
connection
the
others
have
no
part
to
play
so
souls
are
not
said
to
be
immortal
except
in
so
far
as
this
immortality
is
useful
in
rendering
intelligible
the
continuity
of
the
collective
life
thus
the
causes
leading
to
the
first
beliefs
in
a
future
life
had
no
connections
with
the
functions
to
be
filled
at
a
later
period
by
the
institutions
beyond
the
tomb
but
when
that
had
once
appeared
they
were
soon
utilized
for
other
purposes
besides
those
which
had
been
their
original
reasons
for
existence
even
in
the
australian
societies
we
see
them
beginning
to
organize
themselves
for
this
other
purpose
moreover
there
was
no
need
of
any
fundamental
transformation
for
this
how
true
it
is
that
the
same
social
institution
can
successively
fulfil
different
functions
without
changing
its
nature
vi
the
idea
of
the
soul
was
for
a
long
time
and
still
is
in
part
the
popular
form
of
the
idea
of
personality
so
the
genesis
of
the
former
of
these
ideas
should
aid
us
in
understanding
how
the
second
one
was
formed
from
what
has
already
been
said
it
is
clear
that
the
notion
of
person
is
the
product
of
two
sorts
of
factors
one
of
these
is
essentially
impersonal
it
is
the
spiritual
principle
serving
as
the
soul
of
the
group
in
fact
it
is
this
which
constitutes
the
very
substance
of
individual
souls
now
this
is
not
the
possession
of
any
one
in
particular
it
is
a
part
of
the
collective
patrimony
in
it
and
through
it
all
consciousnesses
communicate
but
on
the
other
hand
in
order
to
have
separate
personalities
it
is
necessary
that
another
factor
intervene
to
break
up
and
differentiate
this
principle
in
other
words
an
individualizing
factor
is
necessary
it
is
the
body
that
fulfils
this
function
as
bodies
are
distinct
from
each
other
and
as
they
occupy
different
points
of
space
and
time
each
of
them
forms
a
special
centre
about
which
the
collective
representations
reflect
and
colour
themselves
differently
the
result
is
that
even
if
all
the
consciousnesses
in
these
bodies
are
directed
towards
the
same
world
to
wit
the
world
of
the
ideas
and
sentiments
which
brings
about
the
moral
unity
of
the
group
they
do
not
all
see
it
from
the
same
angle
each
one
expresses
it
in
its
own
fashion
of
these
two
equally
indispensable
factors
the
former
is
certainly
not
the
less
important
for
this
is
the
one
which
furnishes
the
original
matter
for
the
idea
of
the
soul
perhaps
some
will
be
surprised
to
see
so
considerable
a
rôle
attributed
to
the
impersonal
element
in
the
genesis
of
the
idea
of
personality
but
the
philosophical
analysis
of
the
idea
of
person
which
has
gone
far
ahead
of
the
sociological
analysis
has
reached
analogous
results
on
this
point
among
all
the
philosophers
leibniz
is
one
of
those
who
have
felt
most
vividly
what
a
personality
is
for
before
all
the
nomad
is
a
personal
and
autonomous
being
yet
for
leibniz
the
contents
of
all
the
monads
is
identical
in
fact
all
are
consciousnesses
which
express
one
and
the
same
object
the
world
and
as
the
world
itself
is
only
a
system
of
representations
each
particular
consciousness
is
really
only
the
reflection
of
the
universal
consciousness
however
each
one
expresses
it
from
its
own
point
of
view
and
in
its
own
manner
we
know
how
this
difference
of
perspectives
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
monads
are
situated
differently
in
relation
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
system
which
they
constitute
kant
expresses
the
same
sentiment
though
in
a
different
form
for
him
the
of
the
personality
is
the
will
now
the
will
is
the
faculty
of
acting
in
conformity
with
reason
and
the
reason
is
that
which
is
most
impersonal
within
us
for
reason
is
not
my
reason
it
is
human
reason
in
general
it
is
the
power
which
the
mind
has
of
rising
above
the
particular
the
contingent
and
the
individual
to
think
in
universal
forms
so
from
this
point
of
view
we
may
say
that
what
makes
a
man
a
personality
is
that
by
which
he
is
confounded
with
other
men
that
which
makes
him
a
man
not
a
certain
man
the
senses
the
body
and
in
a
word
all
that
individualizes
is
on
the
contrary
considered
as
the
antagonist
of
the
personality
by
kant
this
is
because
individuation
is
not
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
personality
a
person
is
not
merely
a
single
subject
distinguished
from
all
the
others
it
is
especially
a
being
to
which
is
attributed
a
relative
autonomy
in
relation
to
the
environment
with
which
it
is
most
immediately
in
contact
it
is
represented
as
capable
of
moving
itself
to
a
certain
degree
this
is
what
leibniz
expressed
in
an
exaggerated
way
when
he
said
that
the
monad
was
completely
closed
to
the
outside
now
our
analysis
permits
us
to
see
how
this
conception
was
formed
and
to
what
it
corresponds
in
fact
the
soul
a
symbolic
representation
of
the
personality
has
the
same
characteristic
although
closely
bound
to
the
body
it
is
believed
to
be
profoundly
distinct
from
it
and
to
enjoy
in
relation
to
it
a
large
degree
of
independence
during
life
it
may
leave
it
temporarily
and
it
definitely
withdraws
at
death
far
from
being
dependent
upon
the
body
it
dominates
it
from
the
higher
dignity
which
is
in
it
it
may
well
take
from
the
body
the
outward
form
in
which
it
individualizes
itself
but
it
owes
nothing
essential
to
it
nor
is
the
autonomy
which
all
peoples
have
attributed
to
the
soul
a
pure
illusion
we
know
now
what
its
objective
foundation
is
it
is
quite
true
that
the
elements
which
serve
to
form
the
idea
of
the
soul
and
those
which
enter
into
the
representation
of
the
body
come
from
two
different
sources
that
are
independent
of
one
another
one
sort
are
made
up
of
the
images
and
impressions
coming
from
all
parts
of
the
organism
the
others
consist
in
the
ideas
and
sentiments
which
come
from
and
express
society
so
the
former
are
not
derived
from
the
latter
there
really
is
a
part
of
ourselves
which
is
not
placed
in
immediate
dependence
upon
the
organic
factor
this
is
all
that
which
represents
society
in
us
the
general
ideas
which
religion
or
science
fix
in
our
minds
the
mental
operations
which
these
ideas
suppose
the
beliefs
and
sentiments
which
are
at
the
basis
of
our
moral
life
and
all
these
superior
forms
of
psychical
activity
which
society
awakens
in
us
these
do
not
follow
in
the
trail
of
our
bodily
states
as
our
sensations
and
our
general
bodily
consciousness
do
as
we
have
already
shown
this
is
because
the
world
of
representations
in
which
social
life
passes
is
superimposed
upon
its
material
substratum
far
from
arising
from
it
the
determinism
which
reigns
there
is
much
more
supple
than
the
one
whose
roots
are
in
the
constitution
of
our
tissues
and
it
leaves
with
the
actor
a
justified
impression
of
the
greatest
liberty
the
medium
in
which
we
thus
move
is
less
opaque
and
less
resistant
we
feel
ourselves
to
be
and
we
are
more
at
our
ease
there
in
a
word
the
only
way
we
have
of
freeing
ourselves
from
physical
forces
is
to
oppose
them
with
collective
forces
but
whatever
we
receive
from
society
we
hold
in
common
with
our
companions
so
it
is
not
at
all
true
that
we
are
more
personal
as
we
are
more
individualized
the
two
terms
are
in
no
way
synonymous
in
one
sense
they
oppose
more
than
they
imply
one
another
passion
individualizes
yet
it
also
enslaves
our
sensations
are
essentially
individual
yet
we
are
more
personal
the
more
we
are
freed
from
our
senses
and
able
to
think
and
act
with
concepts
so
those
who
insist
upon
all
the
social
elements
of
the
individual
do
not
mean
by
that
to
deny
or
debase
the
personality
they
merely
refuse
to
confuse
it
with
the
fact
of
individuation
chapter
ix
the
idea
of
spirits
and
gods
when
we
come
to
the
idea
of
the
soul
we
have
left
the
circle
of
purely
impersonal
forces
but
above
the
soul
the
australian
religions
already
recognize
mythical
personalities
of
a
superior
order
spirits
civilizing
heroes
and
even
gods
who
are
properly
while
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
enter
into
the
detail
of
the
mythologies
we
must
at
least
seek
the
form
in
which
these
three
categories
of
spiritual
beings
are
presented
in
australia
and
the
way
in
which
they
are
connected
with
the
whole
religious
system
i
a
soul
is
not
a
spirit
in
fact
it
is
shut
up
in
a
determined
organism
though
it
may
leave
it
at
certain
moments
it
is
ordinarily
a
prisoner
there
it
definitely
escapes
only
at
death
and
we
have
already
seen
the
difficulties
under
which
the
separation
is
accomplished
a
spirit
on
the
contrary
though
often
tied
by
the
closest
bonds
to
some
particular
object
such
as
a
spring
a
rock
a
tree
a
star
and
though
residing
there
by
preference
may
go
away
at
will
and
lead
an
independent
existence
in
free
space
so
it
has
a
more
extended
circle
of
action
it
can
act
upon
the
individuals
who
approach
it
or
whom
it
approaches
the
soul
on
the
contrary
has
almost
no
influence
except
over
the
body
it
animates
it
is
very
exceptional
that
it
succeeds
in
influencing
outside
objects
during
the
course
of
its
terrestrial
life
but
if
the
soul
does
not
have
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
spirit
it
acquires
them
at
least
in
part
at
death
in
fact
when
it
has
been
disincarnated
so
long
as
it
does
not
descend
into
a
body
again
it
has
the
same
liberty
of
movement
as
a
spirit
of
course
after
the
rites
of
mourning
have
been
accomplished
it
is
thought
to
go
to
the
land
of
souls
but
before
this
it
remains
about
the
tomb
for
a
rather
long
time
also
even
after
it
has
definitely
departed
it
is
believed
to
prowl
about
in
the
brush
near
the
camp
it
is
generally
represented
as
a
rather
beneficent
being
especially
for
the
surviving
members
of
its
family
we
have
seen
that
the
soul
of
the
father
comes
to
aid
the
growth
of
his
children
or
his
grandchildren
but
it
also
happens
sometimes
that
it
shows
signs
of
a
veritable
cruelty
everything
depends
upon
its
humour
and
the
manner
in
which
it
is
treated
by
the
living
so
it
is
recommended
especially
to
women
and
children
not
to
venture
outside
of
the
camp
during
the
night
so
as
not
to
expose
oneself
to
dangerous
encounters
however
a
ghost
is
not
a
real
spirit
in
the
first
place
it
generally
has
only
a
limited
power
of
action
also
it
does
not
have
a
definite
province
it
is
a
vagabond
upon
whom
no
determined
task
is
incumbent
for
the
effect
of
death
has
been
to
put
it
outside
of
all
regular
forms
as
regards
the
living
it
is
a
sort
of
a
exile
a
spirit
on
the
other
hand
always
has
a
power
of
a
certain
sort
and
it
is
by
this
that
it
is
defined
it
is
set
over
a
certain
order
of
cosmic
or
social
phenomena
it
has
a
more
or
less
precise
function
to
fulfil
in
the
system
of
the
universe
but
there
are
some
souls
which
satisfy
this
double
condition
and
which
are
consequently
spirits
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
these
are
the
souls
of
the
mythical
personages
whom
popular
imagination
has
placed
at
the
beginning
of
time
the
altjirangamitjina
or
the
men
of
the
alcheringa
among
the
arunta
the
among
the
tribes
of
lake
eyre
the
among
the
kurnai
etc
in
one
sense
they
are
still
souls
for
they
are
believed
to
have
formerly
animated
bodies
from
which
they
separated
themselves
at
a
certain
moment
but
even
when
they
led
a
terrestrial
life
they
already
had
as
we
have
seen
exceptional
powers
they
had
a
mana
superior
to
that
of
ordinary
men
and
they
have
kept
it
also
they
are
charged
with
definite
functions
in
the
first
place
whether
we
accept
the
version
of
spencer
and
gillen
or
that
of
strehlow
it
is
to
them
that
the
care
of
assuring
the
periodical
recruiting
of
the
clan
falls
they
have
charge
of
the
phenomena
of
conception
even
when
the
conception
has
been
accomplished
the
task
of
the
ancestor
is
not
yet
completed
it
is
his
duty
to
guard
over
the
child
later
when
the
child
has
become
a
man
he
accompanies
him
in
the
hunt
brings
game
to
him
warns
him
by
dreams
of
the
dangers
he
may
run
protects
him
against
his
enemies
etc
on
this
point
strehlow
is
entirely
in
accord
with
spencer
and
gillen
it
is
true
that
someone
may
ask
how
it
is
possible
according
to
the
version
of
these
latter
for
the
ancestor
to
fulfil
this
function
for
since
he
reincarnates
himself
at
the
moment
of
conception
it
seems
as
though
he
should
be
confounded
with
the
soul
of
the
child
and
should
therefore
be
unable
to
protect
it
from
without
but
the
fact
is
that
he
does
not
reincarnate
himself
entirely
he
merely
duplicates
himself
one
part
of
him
enters
the
body
of
the
woman
and
fertilizes
her
another
part
continues
to
exist
outside
and
under
the
special
name
of
arumburinga
fulfils
the
office
of
guardian
genius
thus
we
see
how
great
a
kinship
there
is
between
this
ancestral
spirit
and
the
of
the
latins
or
the
greek
daimôn
of
the
greeks
the
identification
of
function
is
complete
in
fact
at
first
the
genius
is
the
one
who
begets
he
expresses
and
personifies
the
powers
of
generation
but
at
the
same
time
he
is
the
protector
and
director
of
the
particular
individual
to
whose
person
he
is
attached
he
is
finally
confused
with
the
personality
itself
of
this
individual
he
represents
the
totality
of
the
proclivities
and
tendencies
which
characterize
him
and
give
him
a
distinctive
appearance
among
other
men
hence
come
the
expressions
with
the
sense
of
follow
one
natural
at
bottom
the
is
another
form
or
double
of
the
soul
of
the
individual
this
is
proved
by
the
partial
synonomy
of
and
the
manes
is
the
genius
after
death
but
it
is
also
all
that
survives
of
the
dead
man
that
is
to
say
his
soul
in
the
same
way
the
soul
of
the
arunta
and
the
ancestral
spirit
which
serves
as
his
genius
are
only
two
different
aspects
of
one
and
the
same
being
but
it
is
not
only
in
relation
to
persons
that
the
ancestor
has
a
definite
situation
he
also
has
one
in
relation
to
things
though
he
is
believed
to
have
his
real
residence
under
the
ground
they
think
that
he
is
always
haunting
the
place
where
his
or
rock
is
or
the
which
was
spontaneously
formed
at
the
exact
spot
where
he
disappeared
into
the
ground
having
terminated
his
first
existence
as
this
tree
or
rock
is
believed
to
represent
the
body
of
the
hero
they
imagine
that
the
soul
itself
is
constantly
coming
back
there
and
lives
there
more
or
less
permanently
it
is
by
the
presence
of
this
soul
that
they
explain
the
religious
respect
inspired
by
these
localities
no
one
can
break
the
branch
of
a
without
a
risk
of
falling
sick
formerly
the
act
of
breaking
it
down
or
injuring
it
was
punished
with
death
an
animal
or
bird
taking
refuge
there
could
not
be
killed
even
the
surrounding
bushes
had
to
be
respected
the
grass
could
not
be
burned
the
rocks
also
had
to
be
treated
with
respect
it
was
forbidden
to
remove
them
or
break
them
as
this
sacred
character
is
attributed
to
the
ancestor
he
appears
as
the
spirit
of
this
tree
or
rock
of
this
or
spring
if
the
spring
is
thought
of
as
having
some
connection
with
rain
he
will
become
a
spirit
of
rain
thus
the
same
souls
which
serve
as
protecting
geniuses
for
men
also
fulfil
cosmic
functions
at
the
same
time
it
is
undoubtedly
in
this
sense
that
we
must
understand
the
text
of
roth
where
he
says
that
in
northern
queensland
the
spirits
of
nature
are
the
souls
of
the
dead
who
have
chosen
to
live
in
the
forests
or
caves
so
we
have
here
some
spiritual
beings
that
are
different
from
the
wandering
souls
with
no
definite
powers
strehlow
calls
them
gods
but
this
expression
is
inexact
at
least
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
if
it
were
true
then
in
a
society
like
the
arunta
where
each
one
has
his
protecting
ancestor
there
would
be
as
many
or
more
gods
than
there
are
individuals
it
would
merely
introduce
confusion
into
our
terminology
to
give
the
name
of
god
to
a
sacred
being
with
only
one
worshipper
it
may
be
of
course
that
the
figure
of
the
ancestor
grows
to
a
point
where
it
resembles
a
real
divinity
among
the
warramunga
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
the
clan
as
a
whole
is
thought
to
be
descended
from
one
sole
and
unique
ancestor
it
is
easily
seen
how
this
collective
ancestor
might
under
certain
circumstances
become
the
object
of
a
collective
devotion
to
choose
a
notable
example
this
is
what
has
happened
to
the
snake
wollunqua
this
mythical
beast
from
whom
the
clan
of
the
same
name
is
held
to
be
descended
continues
to
live
they
believe
in
which
are
therefore
surrounded
with
a
religious
respect
thus
it
becomes
the
object
of
a
cult
which
the
clan
celebrates
collectively
through
determined
rites
they
attempt
to
please
him
and
to
win
his
favours
and
they
address
to
him
all
sorts
of
prayers
etc
so
we
may
say
that
he
is
like
a
god
of
the
clan
but
this
is
a
very
exceptional
case
or
even
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
a
unique
one
normally
the
word
spirits
is
the
only
one
suitable
for
designating
these
ancestral
personages
as
to
the
manner
in
which
this
conception
has
been
formed
we
may
say
that
it
is
evident
from
what
has
preceded
as
we
have
already
shown
the
existence
of
individual
souls
when
once
admitted
can
not
be
understood
unless
one
imagines
an
original
supply
of
fundamental
souls
at
the
origin
of
things
from
which
all
the
others
were
derived
now
these
architype
souls
had
to
be
conceived
as
containing
within
them
the
source
of
all
religious
efficacy
for
since
the
imagination
does
not
go
beyond
them
it
is
from
them
and
only
from
them
that
all
sacred
things
are
believed
to
come
both
the
instruments
of
the
cult
the
members
of
the
clan
and
the
animals
of
the
totemic
species
they
incarnate
all
the
sacredness
diffused
in
the
whole
tribe
and
the
whole
world
and
so
they
are
attributed
powers
noticeably
superior
to
those
enjoyed
by
the
simple
souls
of
men
moreover
time
by
itself
increases
and
reinforces
the
sacred
character
of
things
a
very
ancient
churinga
inspires
much
more
respect
than
a
new
one
and
is
supposed
to
have
more
virtues
the
sentiments
of
veneration
of
which
it
has
been
the
object
during
the
series
of
successive
generations
who
have
handled
it
are
as
it
were
accumulated
in
it
for
the
same
reason
the
personages
who
for
centuries
have
been
the
subject
of
myths
respectfully
passed
on
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
periodically
put
into
action
by
the
rites
could
not
fail
to
take
a
very
especial
place
in
the
popular
imagination
but
how
does
it
happen
that
instead
of
remaining
outside
of
the
organized
society
they
have
become
regular
members
of
it
this
is
because
each
individual
is
the
double
of
an
ancestor
now
when
two
beings
are
related
as
closely
as
this
they
are
naturally
conceived
as
incorporated
together
since
they
participate
in
the
same
nature
it
seems
as
though
that
which
affects
one
ought
to
affect
the
other
as
well
thus
the
group
of
mythical
ancestors
became
attached
to
the
society
of
the
living
the
same
interests
and
the
same
passions
were
attributed
to
each
they
were
regarded
as
associates
however
as
the
former
had
a
higher
dignity
than
the
latter
this
association
takes
in
the
public
mind
the
form
of
an
agreement
between
superiors
and
inferiors
between
patrons
and
clients
benefactors
and
recipients
thus
comes
this
curious
idea
of
a
protecting
genius
who
is
attached
to
each
individual
the
question
of
how
this
ancestor
came
to
have
relations
not
only
with
men
but
also
with
things
may
appear
more
embarrassing
for
at
the
first
glance
we
do
not
see
what
connection
there
can
be
between
a
personage
of
this
sort
and
a
rock
or
tree
but
a
fact
which
we
owe
to
strehlow
furnishes
us
with
a
solution
of
this
problem
which
is
at
least
probable
these
trees
and
rocks
are
not
situated
at
any
point
in
the
tribal
territory
but
for
the
most
part
they
are
grouped
around
the
sanctuaries
called
ertnatulunga
by
spencer
and
gillen
and
arknanaua
by
strehlow
where
the
churinga
of
the
clan
is
kept
we
know
the
respect
with
which
these
localities
are
enhaloed
from
the
mere
fact
that
the
most
precious
instruments
of
the
cult
are
there
each
of
these
spreads
sanctity
all
about
it
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
neighbouring
trees
and
rocks
appear
sacred
that
it
is
forbidden
to
destroy
or
harm
them
and
that
all
violence
used
against
them
is
a
sacrilege
this
sacred
character
is
really
due
to
a
simple
phenomenon
of
psychic
contagiousness
but
in
order
to
explain
it
the
native
must
admit
that
these
different
objects
have
relations
with
the
different
beings
in
whom
he
sees
the
source
of
all
religious
power
that
is
to
say
with
the
ancestors
of
the
alcheringa
hence
comes
the
system
of
myths
of
which
we
have
spoken
they
imagined
that
each
ertnatulunga
marked
the
spot
where
a
group
of
ancestors
entered
into
the
ground
the
mounds
or
trees
which
covered
the
ground
were
believed
to
represent
their
bodies
but
as
the
soul
retains
in
a
general
way
a
sort
of
affinity
for
the
body
in
which
it
dwelt
they
were
naturally
led
to
believe
that
these
ancestral
souls
continued
to
frequent
these
places
where
their
material
envelope
remained
so
they
were
located
in
the
rocks
the
trees
or
the
thus
each
of
them
though
remaining
attached
to
some
determined
individual
became
transformed
into
a
sort
of
and
fulfilled
its
functions
the
conceptions
thus
elucidated
enable
us
to
understand
a
form
of
totemism
which
we
have
left
unexplained
up
to
the
present
this
is
individual
totemism
an
individual
totem
is
defined
in
its
essence
by
the
two
following
characteristics
it
is
a
being
in
an
animal
or
vegetable
form
whose
function
is
to
protect
an
individual
the
fate
of
this
individual
and
that
of
his
patron
are
closely
united
all
that
touches
the
latter
is
sympathetically
communicated
to
the
former
now
the
ancestral
spirits
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
answer
to
this
same
definition
they
also
belong
at
least
in
part
to
the
animal
or
vegetable
kingdoms
they
too
are
protecting
geniuses
finally
a
sympathetic
bond
unites
each
individual
to
his
protecting
ancestor
in
fact
the
representing
the
mystical
body
of
this
ancestor
can
not
be
destroyed
without
the
man
feeling
himself
menaced
it
is
true
that
this
belief
is
losing
its
force
but
spencer
and
gillen
have
observed
it
and
in
any
case
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
formerly
it
was
quite
general
the
identity
of
these
two
conceptions
is
found
even
in
their
details
the
ancestral
souls
reside
in
trees
or
rocks
which
are
considered
sacred
likewise
among
the
euahlayi
the
spirit
of
the
animal
serving
as
individual
totem
is
believed
to
inhabit
a
tree
or
stone
this
tree
or
stone
is
sacred
no
one
may
touch
it
except
the
proprietor
of
the
totem
when
it
is
a
stone
or
rock
this
interdiction
is
still
absolute
the
result
is
that
they
are
veritable
places
of
refuge
finally
we
have
seen
that
the
individual
soul
is
only
another
aspect
of
the
ancestral
spirit
according
to
strehlow
this
serves
after
a
fashion
as
a
second
self
likewise
following
an
expression
of
parker
the
individual
totem
of
the
euahlayi
called
yunbeai
is
the
of
the
individual
the
soul
of
a
man
is
in
his
yunbeai
and
the
soul
of
his
yunbeai
is
in
him
so
at
bottom
it
is
one
soul
in
two
bodies
the
kinship
of
these
two
notions
is
so
close
that
they
are
sometimes
expressed
by
one
and
the
same
word
this
is
the
case
in
melanesia
and
in
polynesia
in
the
island
mota
in
the
island
aurora
and
in
motlaw
all
designate
both
the
soul
of
the
individual
and
his
personal
totem
it
is
the
same
with
in
samoa
this
is
because
the
individual
totem
is
merely
the
outward
and
visible
form
of
the
ego
or
the
personality
of
which
the
soul
is
the
inward
and
invisible
form
thus
the
individual
totem
has
all
the
essential
characteristics
of
the
protecting
ancestor
and
fills
the
same
rôle
this
is
because
it
has
the
same
origin
and
proceeds
from
the
same
idea
each
of
them
in
fact
consists
in
a
duplication
of
the
soul
the
totem
as
the
ancestor
is
the
soul
of
the
individual
but
externalized
and
invested
with
powers
superior
to
those
it
is
believed
to
possess
while
within
the
organism
now
this
duplication
is
the
result
of
a
psychological
necessity
for
it
only
expresses
the
nature
of
the
soul
which
as
we
have
seen
is
double
in
one
sense
it
is
ours
it
expresses
our
personality
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
outside
of
us
for
it
is
only
the
reaching
into
us
of
a
religious
force
which
is
outside
of
us
we
can
not
confound
ourselves
with
it
completely
for
we
attribute
to
it
an
excellence
and
a
dignity
by
which
it
rises
far
above
us
and
our
empirical
individuality
so
there
is
a
whole
part
of
ourselves
which
we
tend
to
project
into
the
outside
this
way
of
thinking
of
ourselves
is
so
well
established
in
our
nature
that
we
can
not
escape
it
even
when
we
attempt
to
regard
ourselves
without
having
recourse
to
any
religious
symbols
our
moral
consciousness
is
like
a
nucleus
about
which
the
idea
of
the
soul
forms
itself
yet
when
it
speaks
to
us
it
gives
the
effect
of
an
outside
power
superior
to
us
which
gives
us
our
law
and
judges
us
but
which
also
aids
and
sustains
us
when
we
have
it
on
our
side
we
feel
ourselves
to
be
stronger
against
the
trials
of
life
and
better
assured
of
triumphing
over
them
just
as
the
australian
who
when
trusting
in
his
ancestor
or
his
personal
totem
feels
himself
more
valiant
against
his
enemies
so
there
is
something
objective
at
the
basis
of
these
conceptions
whether
we
have
in
mind
the
roman
the
individual
totem
or
the
alcheringa
ancestor
and
this
is
why
they
have
survived
in
various
forms
up
to
the
present
day
everything
goes
just
as
if
we
really
had
two
souls
one
which
is
within
us
or
rather
which
is
us
the
other
which
is
above
us
and
whose
function
it
is
to
control
and
assist
the
first
one
frazer
thought
that
the
individual
totem
was
an
external
soul
but
he
believed
that
this
exteriority
was
the
result
of
an
artifice
and
a
magic
ruse
in
reality
it
is
implied
in
the
very
constitution
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
ii
the
spirits
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
are
essentially
benefactors
of
course
they
punish
a
man
if
he
does
not
treat
them
in
a
fitting
manner
but
it
is
not
their
function
to
work
evil
however
a
spirit
is
in
itself
just
as
capable
of
doing
evil
as
good
this
is
why
we
find
a
class
of
evil
geniuses
forming
itself
naturally
in
opposition
to
these
auxiliary
and
protecting
spirits
which
enables
men
to
explain
the
permanent
evils
that
they
have
to
suffer
their
nightmares
and
illnesses
whirlwinds
and
tempests
etc
of
course
this
is
not
saying
that
all
these
human
miseries
have
appeared
as
things
too
abnormal
to
be
explained
in
any
way
except
by
supernatural
forces
but
it
is
saying
that
these
forces
are
thought
of
under
a
religious
form
as
it
is
a
religious
principle
which
is
considered
the
source
of
life
so
all
the
events
which
disturb
or
destroy
life
ought
logically
to
be
traced
to
a
principle
of
the
same
sort
these
harmful
spirits
seem
to
have
been
conceived
on
the
same
model
as
the
good
spirits
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
they
are
represented
in
an
animal
form
or
one
that
is
but
men
are
naturally
inclined
to
give
them
enormous
dimensions
and
a
repulsive
aspect
like
the
souls
of
the
ancestors
they
are
believed
to
inhabit
trees
rocks
and
subterranean
caverns
taking
the
arunta
as
a
particular
example
spencer
and
gillen
say
expressly
that
these
evil
geniuses
known
under
the
name
of
oruncha
are
beings
of
the
alcheringa
many
are
represented
as
the
souls
of
persons
who
had
led
a
terrestrial
life
among
the
personages
of
the
fabulous
epoch
there
were
in
fact
many
different
temperaments
some
had
cruel
and
evil
instincts
which
they
retained
others
were
naturally
of
a
bad
constitution
they
were
thin
and
emaciated
so
after
they
had
entered
into
the
ground
the
nanja
rocks
to
which
they
gave
birth
were
considered
the
homes
of
dangerous
influences
yet
they
are
distinguished
by
special
characteristics
from
their
confrères
the
heroes
of
the
alcheringa
they
do
not
reincarnate
themselves
among
living
men
there
is
no
one
who
represents
them
they
are
without
human
posterity
when
judging
from
certain
signs
they
believe
that
a
child
is
the
result
of
their
work
it
is
put
to
death
as
soon
as
born
also
these
belong
to
no
determined
totemic
group
they
are
outside
the
social
organization
by
all
these
traits
they
are
recognized
as
magic
powers
rather
than
religious
ones
and
in
fact
it
is
especially
with
the
magician
that
they
have
relations
very
frequently
it
is
from
them
that
he
gets
his
powers
so
we
have
now
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
world
of
religion
stops
and
that
of
magic
commences
and
as
this
latter
is
outside
the
field
of
our
research
we
need
not
push
our
researches
further
iii
the
appearance
of
the
notion
of
spirits
marks
an
important
step
in
advance
in
the
individualization
of
religious
forces
however
the
spiritual
beings
of
whom
we
have
been
speaking
up
to
the
present
are
as
yet
only
secondary
personages
they
are
either
geniuses
who
belong
to
magic
rather
than
religion
or
else
being
attached
to
determined
individuals
or
places
they
can
not
make
their
influence
felt
except
within
a
circle
of
a
very
limited
radius
so
they
can
only
be
the
objects
of
private
and
local
rites
but
after
the
idea
has
once
been
established
it
naturally
spreads
to
the
higher
spheres
of
the
religious
life
and
thus
mythical
personalities
of
a
superior
order
are
born
though
the
ceremonies
of
the
different
clans
differ
from
one
another
they
all
belong
to
the
same
religion
none
the
less
also
a
certain
number
of
essential
similarities
exist
between
them
since
all
the
clans
are
only
parts
of
one
and
the
same
tribe
the
unity
of
the
tribe
can
not
fail
to
make
itself
felt
through
this
diversity
of
particular
cults
in
fact
there
is
no
totemic
group
that
does
not
have
churinga
and
and
these
are
used
everywhere
in
the
same
way
the
organization
of
the
tribe
into
phratries
matrimonial
classes
and
clans
and
the
exogamic
interdictions
attached
to
them
are
veritable
tribal
institutions
the
initiation
celebrations
all
include
certain
fundamental
practices
the
extraction
of
a
tooth
circumcision
subincision
which
do
not
vary
with
the
totems
within
a
single
tribe
the
uniformity
on
this
point
is
the
more
easily
established
as
the
initiation
always
takes
place
in
the
presence
of
the
tribe
or
at
least
before
an
assembly
to
which
the
different
clans
have
been
summoned
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
object
of
the
initiation
is
to
introduce
the
neophyte
into
the
religious
life
not
merely
of
the
clan
into
which
he
was
born
but
of
the
tribe
as
a
whole
so
it
is
necessary
that
the
various
aspects
of
the
tribal
religion
be
represented
before
him
and
take
place
in
a
way
under
his
very
eyes
it
is
on
this
occasion
that
the
moral
and
religious
unity
of
the
tribe
is
affirmed
the
best
thus
in
each
society
there
are
a
certain
number
of
rites
which
are
distinguished
from
all
the
others
by
their
homogeneity
and
their
generality
so
noticeably
a
harmony
seemed
to
be
explicable
only
by
a
unity
of
origin
so
they
imagined
that
each
group
of
similar
rites
had
been
founded
by
one
and
the
same
ancestor
who
came
to
reveal
them
to
the
tribe
as
a
whole
thus
among
the
arunta
it
was
an
ancestor
of
the
wild
cat
clan
named
putiaputia
who
is
thought
to
have
taught
men
the
way
of
making
churinga
and
using
it
ritually
among
the
warramunga
it
was
among
the
urabunna
witurna
it
was
atnatu
among
the
kaitish
and
tendun
among
the
kurnai
likewise
the
practice
of
circumcision
is
attributed
by
the
eastern
dieri
and
many
other
tribes
to
two
special
muramura
and
by
the
arunta
to
a
hero
of
the
alcheringa
of
the
lizard
totem
named
mangarkunjerkunja
to
this
same
personage
are
ascribed
the
foundation
of
the
matrimonial
institutions
and
the
social
organization
they
imply
the
discovery
of
fire
the
invention
of
the
spear
the
buckler
the
boomerang
etc
it
also
happens
very
frequently
that
the
inventor
of
the
is
also
considered
the
founder
of
the
rites
of
initiation
these
special
ancestors
can
not
be
put
in
the
same
rank
as
the
others
on
the
one
hand
the
sentiments
of
veneration
which
they
inspire
are
not
limited
to
one
clan
but
are
common
to
the
whole
tribe
on
the
other
hand
it
is
to
them
that
men
ascribe
all
that
is
most
esteemed
in
the
tribal
civilization
for
this
double
reason
they
became
the
object
of
a
special
consideration
for
example
they
say
of
atnatu
that
he
was
born
in
heaven
at
an
epoch
even
prior
to
the
times
of
the
alcheringa
that
he
made
himself
and
that
he
gave
himself
the
name
he
bears
the
stars
are
his
wives
and
daughters
beyond
the
heaven
where
he
lives
there
is
another
one
with
another
sun
his
name
is
sacred
and
should
never
be
pronounced
before
women
or
persons
yet
howsoever
great
the
prestige
enjoyed
by
these
personages
may
be
there
was
no
occasion
for
founding
special
rites
in
their
honour
for
they
themselves
are
only
rites
personified
they
have
no
other
reason
for
existence
than
to
explain
existing
practices
they
are
only
another
aspect
of
these
the
churinga
and
the
ancestor
who
invented
it
are
only
one
sometimes
both
have
the
same
name
when
someone
makes
the
resound
they
say
that
it
is
the
voice
of
the
ancestor
making
himself
heard
but
for
the
very
reason
that
each
of
these
heroes
is
confounded
with
the
cult
he
is
believed
to
have
founded
they
believe
that
he
is
attentive
to
the
way
in
which
it
is
celebrated
he
is
not
satisfied
unless
the
worshippers
fulfil
their
duties
exactly
he
punishes
those
who
are
negligent
so
he
is
thought
of
as
the
guardian
of
the
rite
as
well
as
its
founder
and
for
this
reason
he
becomes
invested
with
a
veritable
moral
rôle
iv
however
this
mythological
formation
is
not
the
highest
which
is
to
be
found
among
the
australians
there
are
at
least
a
certain
number
of
tribes
who
have
arrived
at
a
conception
of
a
god
who
if
not
unique
is
at
least
supreme
and
to
whom
is
attributed
a
position
among
all
the
other
religious
entities
the
existence
of
this
belief
was
pointed
out
long
ago
by
different
observers
but
it
is
howitt
who
has
contributed
the
most
to
establishing
its
relative
generality
in
fact
he
has
verified
it
over
a
very
extended
geographical
area
embracing
the
state
of
victoria
and
new
south
wales
and
even
extending
up
to
queensland
in
all
this
entire
region
a
considerable
number
of
tribes
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
veritable
tribal
divinity
who
has
different
names
according
to
the
district
the
ones
most
frequently
employed
are
bunjil
or
punjil
daramulun
and
baiame
but
we
also
find
nuralie
or
nurelle
kohin
and
the
same
conception
is
found
again
farther
west
among
the
narrinyeri
where
the
great
god
is
called
nurunderi
or
ngurrunderi
among
the
dieri
it
is
probable
that
there
is
one
of
the
or
ordinary
ancestors
who
enjoys
a
sort
of
supremacy
over
the
others
finally
in
opposition
to
the
affirmations
of
spencer
and
gillen
who
declare
that
they
have
observed
no
belief
in
a
real
divinity
among
the
arunta
strehlow
assures
us
that
this
people
as
well
as
the
loritja
recognize
under
the
name
altjira
a
veritable
good
god
the
essential
characteristics
of
this
personage
are
the
same
everywhere
it
is
an
immortal
and
even
an
eternal
being
for
it
was
not
derived
from
any
other
after
having
lived
on
earth
for
a
certain
length
of
time
he
ascended
to
heaven
or
else
was
taken
up
there
and
continues
to
live
there
surrounded
by
his
family
for
generally
he
is
said
to
have
one
or
several
wives
children
and
brothers
who
sometimes
assist
him
in
his
functions
under
the
pretext
of
a
visit
he
is
said
to
have
made
to
them
he
and
his
family
are
frequently
identified
with
certain
stars
moreover
they
attribute
to
him
a
power
over
stars
it
is
he
who
regulates
the
journey
of
the
sun
and
moon
he
gives
them
orders
it
is
he
who
makes
the
lightning
leap
from
the
clouds
and
who
throws
the
since
he
is
the
thunder
he
is
also
connected
with
the
rain
it
is
to
him
that
men
address
themselves
when
there
is
a
scarcity
of
water
or
when
too
much
falls
they
speak
of
him
as
a
sort
of
creator
he
is
called
the
father
of
men
and
they
say
that
he
made
them
according
to
a
legend
current
around
melbourne
bunjil
made
the
first
man
in
the
following
manner
he
made
a
little
statue
out
of
white
clay
then
after
he
had
danced
all
around
it
several
times
and
had
breathed
into
its
nostrils
the
statue
became
animated
and
commenced
to
walk
about
according
to
another
myth
he
lighted
the
sun
thus
the
earth
became
heated
and
men
came
out
of
it
at
the
same
time
that
he
made
men
this
divine
personage
made
the
animals
and
trees
it
is
to
him
that
men
owe
all
the
arts
of
life
arms
language
and
tribal
rites
he
is
the
benefactor
of
humanity
even
yet
he
plays
the
rôle
of
a
sort
of
providence
for
them
it
is
he
who
supplies
his
worshippers
with
all
that
is
necessary
for
their
existence
he
is
in
communication
with
them
either
directly
or
through
intermediaries
but
being
at
the
same
time
guardian
of
the
morals
of
the
tribe
he
treats
them
severely
when
these
are
violated
if
we
are
to
believe
certain
observers
he
will
even
fulfil
the
office
of
judge
after
this
life
he
will
separate
the
good
from
the
bad
and
will
not
reward
the
ones
like
the
others
in
any
case
they
are
often
represented
as
ruling
the
land
of
the
dead
and
as
gathering
the
souls
together
when
they
arrive
in
the
beyond
as
the
initiation
is
the
principal
form
of
the
tribal
cult
it
is
to
the
rites
of
initiation
that
he
is
attached
especially
he
is
their
centre
he
is
very
frequently
represented
by
an
image
cut
on
a
piece
of
bark
or
soaked
into
the
ground
they
dance
around
it
they
sing
in
its
honour
they
even
address
real
prayers
to
it
they
explain
to
the
young
men
who
the
personage
is
whom
this
image
represents
they
tell
them
his
secret
name
which
the
women
and
the
uninitiated
can
not
know
they
relate
to
them
his
history
and
the
part
attributed
to
him
in
the
life
of
the
tribe
at
other
times
they
raise
their
hands
towards
the
heaven
where
he
is
thought
to
dwell
or
else
they
point
their
arms
or
the
ritual
instruments
they
have
in
hand
in
this
direction
this
is
a
way
of
entering
into
communication
with
him
they
feel
his
presence
everywhere
he
watches
over
the
neophyte
when
he
has
withdrawn
into
the
forest
he
is
attentive
to
the
manner
in
which
the
ceremonies
are
celebrated
the
initiation
is
his
cult
so
he
gives
special
attention
to
seeing
that
these
are
carried
out
exactly
if
there
are
any
faults
or
negligences
he
punishes
them
in
a
terrible
manner
moreover
the
authority
of
each
of
these
supreme
gods
is
not
limited
to
a
single
tribe
it
is
recognized
equally
by
a
number
of
neighbouring
tribes
bunjil
is
adored
in
nearly
all
of
victoria
baiame
in
a
considerable
portion
of
new
south
wales
etc
this
is
why
there
are
so
few
gods
for
a
relatively
extended
geographical
area
so
the
cults
of
which
they
are
the
object
have
an
international
character
it
even
happens
sometimes
that
mythologies
intermingle
combine
and
make
mutual
borrowings
thus
the
majority
of
the
tribes
who
believe
in
baiame
also
admit
the
existence
of
daramulun
however
they
accord
him
a
slighter
dignity
they
make
him
a
son
or
brother
of
baiame
and
subordinate
to
this
latter
thus
the
faith
in
daramulun
has
spread
in
diverse
forms
into
all
of
new
south
wales
so
it
is
far
from
true
that
religious
internationalism
is
a
peculiarity
of
the
most
recent
and
advanced
religions
from
the
dawn
of
history
religious
beliefs
have
manifested
a
tendency
to
overflow
out
of
one
strictly
limited
political
society
it
is
as
though
they
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
crossing
frontiers
and
for
diffusing
and
internationalizing
themselves
of
course
there
have
been
peoples
and
times
when
this
spontaneous
aptitude
has
been
held
in
check
by
opposed
social
necessities
but
that
does
not
keep
it
from
being
real
and
as
we
see
very
primitive
to
tylor
this
conception
has
appeared
to
be
a
part
of
so
elevated
a
theology
that
he
refuses
to
see
in
it
anything
but
the
product
of
a
european
importation
he
would
have
it
be
a
more
or
less
denatured
christian
idea
andrew
lang
on
the
contrary
considers
them
autochthonous
but
as
he
also
admits
that
it
is
contrasted
with
all
the
other
australian
beliefs
and
rests
on
completely
different
principles
he
concludes
that
the
religions
of
australia
are
made
up
of
two
heterogeneous
systems
superimposed
one
upon
the
other
and
consequently
derived
from
a
double
origin
on
the
one
hand
there
were
ideas
relative
to
totems
and
spirits
which
had
been
suggested
to
men
by
the
sight
of
certain
natural
phenomena
but
at
the
same
time
by
a
sort
of
intuition
as
to
the
nature
of
which
he
refuses
to
make
himself
clear
the
human
intelligence
succeeded
at
the
first
onset
in
conceiving
a
unique
god
creator
of
the
world
and
legislator
of
the
moral
order
lang
even
estimates
that
this
idea
was
purer
of
foreign
elements
at
the
beginning
and
especially
in
australia
than
in
the
civilizations
which
immediately
followed
with
time
it
was
covered
over
and
obscured
little
by
little
by
the
mass
of
animistic
and
totemic
superstitions
thus
it
underwent
a
sort
of
progressive
degeneration
up
to
the
day
when
as
the
effect
of
a
privileged
culture
it
succeeded
in
coming
into
its
own
and
restated
itself
again
with
more
force
and
clarity
than
it
had
in
the
first
place
but
the
facts
allow
neither
the
sceptical
hypothesis
of
tylor
nor
the
theological
interpretation
of
lang
in
the
first
place
it
is
certain
that
the
ideas
relative
to
the
great
tribal
god
are
of
indigenous
origin
they
were
observed
before
the
influence
of
the
missionaries
had
as
yet
had
time
to
make
itself
felt
but
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
necessary
to
attribute
them
to
a
mysterious
revelation
far
from
being
derived
from
a
different
source
than
the
regular
totemic
beliefs
they
are
on
the
contrary
only
the
logical
of
these
beliefs
and
their
highest
form
we
have
already
seen
how
the
notion
of
mythical
ancestors
is
implied
in
the
very
principles
upon
which
totemism
rests
for
each
of
them
is
a
totemic
being
now
though
the
great
gods
are
certainly
superior
to
these
still
there
are
only
differences
of
degree
between
them
we
pass
from
the
first
to
the
second
with
no
break
of
continuity
in
fact
a
great
god
is
himself
an
ancestor
of
especial
importance
they
frequently
speak
to
us
about
him
as
though
he
were
a
man
endowed
to
be
sure
with
more
than
human
powers
but
one
who
lived
a
human
life
upon
the
earth
he
is
pictured
as
a
great
hunter
a
powerful
magician
or
the
founder
of
the
tribe
he
was
the
first
man
one
legend
even
represents
him
in
the
form
of
a
old
man
who
could
hardly
move
about
if
a
supreme
god
named
has
existed
among
the
dieri
the
very
word
is
significant
for
it
serves
to
designate
the
class
of
the
ancestors
likewise
nuralie
the
name
of
a
great
god
among
the
tribes
on
the
murray
river
is
sometimes
used
as
a
collective
expression
which
is
applied
to
the
group
of
mythical
beings
whom
tradition
places
at
the
origin
of
things
they
are
personages
wholly
comparable
to
those
of
the
alcheringa
in
queensland
we
have
already
met
with
a
god
anjea
or
anjir
who
made
men
but
who
seems
nevertheless
to
be
only
the
first
man
a
fact
that
has
aided
australian
thought
to
pass
from
the
numerous
ancestral
geniuses
to
the
idea
of
the
tribal
god
is
that
between
the
two
extremes
a
middle
term
has
been
inserted
which
has
served
as
a
transition
these
are
the
civilizing
heroes
the
fabulous
beings
whom
we
call
by
this
name
are
really
simple
ancestors
to
whom
mythology
has
attributed
an
eminent
place
in
the
history
of
the
tribe
and
whom
it
has
for
this
reason
set
above
the
others
we
have
even
seen
that
they
ordinarily
form
a
part
of
the
totemic
organization
mangarkunjerkunja
belongs
to
the
lizard
totem
and
putiaputia
to
the
wild
cat
totem
but
on
the
other
hand
the
functions
which
they
are
believed
to
fulfil
or
to
have
fulfilled
are
closely
similar
to
those
incumbent
upon
a
great
god
he
too
is
believed
to
have
introduced
the
arts
of
civilization
among
men
to
have
been
the
founder
of
the
principal
social
institutions
and
the
revealer
of
the
great
religious
ceremonies
which
still
remain
under
his
control
if
he
is
the
father
of
men
it
is
because
he
manufactured
them
rather
than
begat
them
but
mangarkunjerkunja
also
made
them
before
his
time
there
were
no
men
but
only
unformed
masses
of
flesh
in
which
the
different
members
and
even
the
different
individuals
were
not
yet
separated
from
one
another
it
was
he
who
cut
up
this
original
matter
and
made
real
human
beings
out
of
it
between
this
mode
of
fabrication
and
the
one
the
myth
we
have
spoken
of
attributes
to
bunjil
there
are
only
shades
of
difference
moreover
the
bonds
uniting
these
two
sorts
of
figures
to
each
other
are
well
shown
by
the
fact
that
a
relationship
of
descent
is
sometimes
established
between
them
among
the
kurnai
the
hero
of
the
tundun
is
the
son
of
the
great
god
likewise
among
the
euahlayi
daramulun
the
son
or
brother
of
baiame
is
identical
with
gayandi
who
is
the
equivalent
of
the
tundun
of
the
kurnai
of
course
it
is
not
necessary
to
conclude
from
these
facts
that
the
great
god
is
nothing
more
than
a
civilizing
hero
there
are
cases
where
these
two
personages
are
carefully
differentiated
but
if
they
are
not
confounded
they
are
at
least
relatives
so
it
sometimes
happens
that
we
find
it
hard
to
distinguish
them
there
are
some
who
could
be
classified
equally
well
in
one
category
or
the
other
thus
we
have
spoken
of
atnatu
as
a
civilizing
hero
but
he
comes
very
near
to
being
a
great
god
the
notion
of
a
supreme
god
even
depends
so
closely
upon
the
entire
system
of
the
totemic
beliefs
that
it
still
bears
their
mark
tundun
is
a
divine
hero
as
we
have
just
seen
who
is
very
close
to
the
tribal
divinity
now
among
the
kurnai
the
same
word
means
totem
similarly
among
the
arunta
altjira
is
the
name
of
a
great
god
it
is
also
the
name
of
the
maternal
totem
but
there
is
more
to
be
said
than
this
many
great
gods
have
an
obviously
totemic
aspect
daramulun
is
an
his
mother
an
emu
it
is
also
under
the
features
of
an
emu
that
baiame
is
represented
the
altjira
of
the
arunta
has
the
legs
of
an
emu
before
being
the
name
of
a
great
god
nuralie
designated
as
we
just
saw
the
of
the
tribe
now
some
of
these
were
crows
the
others
hawks
according
to
howitt
bunjil
is
always
represented
in
a
human
form
however
the
same
word
serves
to
designate
the
totem
of
a
phratry
the
at
least
one
of
his
sons
is
among
the
totems
included
in
the
phratry
to
which
he
has
given
or
from
which
he
has
taken
his
name
his
brother
is
pallyan
the
bat
now
this
latter
serves
as
sexual
totem
for
the
men
in
many
tribes
in
victoria
we
can
even
go
farther
and
state
more
definitely
the
connection
which
these
great
gods
have
with
the
totemic
system
we
have
just
seen
that
bunjil
is
the
totem
of
a
phratry
daramulun
like
bunjil
is
an
and
we
know
that
this
bird
is
the
totem
of
phratries
in
a
large
number
of
tribes
we
have
already
pointed
out
that
nuralie
seems
to
have
originally
been
a
collective
term
designating
indistinctly
either
or
crows
now
in
the
tribes
where
this
myth
has
been
observed
the
crow
is
the
totem
of
one
of
the
two
phratries
the
that
of
the
other
also
the
legendary
history
of
the
great
gods
resembles
that
of
the
totems
of
the
phratries
very
closely
the
myths
and
sometimes
the
rites
commemorate
the
struggles
which
each
of
these
divinities
fought
against
a
carnivorous
bird
over
which
it
triumphed
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
bunjil
the
first
man
after
making
the
second
man
karween
entered
into
a
conflict
with
him
and
in
the
course
of
a
sort
of
duel
he
wounded
him
severely
and
changed
him
into
a
crow
the
two
species
of
nurtalie
are
represented
as
two
hostile
groups
which
were
originally
in
a
constant
state
of
war
baiame
on
his
side
had
to
fight
against
mullian
the
cannibal
who
by
the
way
is
identical
with
daramulun
now
as
we
have
seen
there
is
also
a
sort
of
constitutional
hostility
between
the
totems
of
the
phratries
this
parallelism
completes
the
proof
that
the
mythology
of
the
great
gods
and
that
of
these
totems
are
closely
related
this
relationship
will
appear
still
more
evident
if
we
notice
that
the
rival
of
the
god
is
regularly
either
a
crow
or
an
and
that
these
are
quite
generally
the
totems
of
the
phratries
so
baiame
daramulun
nuralie
and
bunjil
seem
to
be
who
have
been
deified
and
we
may
imagine
that
this
apotheosis
took
place
as
follows
it
is
obviously
in
the
assemblies
which
take
place
in
regard
to
the
initiation
that
the
conception
was
elaborated
for
the
great
gods
do
not
play
a
rôle
of
any
importance
except
in
these
rites
and
are
strangers
to
the
other
religious
ceremonies
moreover
as
the
initiation
is
the
principal
form
of
the
tribal
cult
it
is
only
on
this
occasion
that
a
tribal
mythology
could
arise
we
have
already
seen
how
the
rituals
of
circumcision
and
subincision
spontaneously
tend
to
personify
themselves
under
the
form
of
civilizing
heroes
however
these
heroes
exercised
no
supremacy
they
were
on
the
same
footing
as
the
other
legendary
benefactors
of
society
but
wherever
the
tribe
acquired
a
livelier
sentiment
of
itself
this
sentiment
naturally
incarnated
itself
in
some
personage
who
became
its
symbol
in
order
to
account
for
the
bonds
uniting
them
to
one
another
no
matter
what
clan
they
belonged
to
men
imagined
that
they
were
all
descended
from
the
same
stock
and
that
they
were
all
descended
from
a
single
father
to
whom
they
owe
their
existence
though
he
owed
his
to
no
one
the
god
of
the
initiation
was
predestined
to
this
rôle
for
according
to
an
expression
frequently
coming
to
the
lips
of
the
natives
the
object
of
the
initiation
is
to
make
or
manufacture
men
so
they
attributed
a
creative
power
to
this
god
and
for
all
these
reasons
he
found
himself
invested
with
a
prestige
setting
him
well
above
the
other
heroes
of
the
mythology
these
others
became
his
auxiliaries
subordinate
to
him
they
were
made
his
sons
or
younger
brothers
as
was
the
case
with
tundun
gayandi
karween
pallyan
etc
but
other
sacred
beings
already
existed
who
occupied
an
equally
eminent
place
in
the
religious
system
of
the
clan
these
were
the
totems
of
the
phratries
wherever
these
are
maintained
they
are
believed
to
keep
the
totems
of
the
clans
dependent
upon
them
thus
they
had
all
that
was
necessary
for
becoming
tribal
divinities
themselves
so
it
was
only
natural
that
a
partial
confusion
should
arise
between
these
two
sorts
of
mythical
beings
it
is
thus
that
one
of
the
two
fundamental
totems
of
the
tribe
gave
his
traits
to
the
great
god
but
as
it
was
necessary
to
explain
why
only
one
of
them
was
called
to
this
dignity
and
the
other
excluded
they
supposed
that
this
latter
in
the
course
of
a
fight
against
his
rival
was
vanquished
and
that
his
exclusion
was
the
consequence
of
his
defeat
this
theory
was
the
more
readily
admitted
because
it
was
in
accord
with
the
rest
of
the
mythology
where
the
totems
of
the
phratries
are
generally
considered
enemies
of
one
another
a
myth
observed
by
parker
among
the
euahlayi
may
serve
to
confirm
this
explanation
for
it
merely
translates
it
into
figurative
language
it
is
related
that
in
this
tribe
the
totems
were
only
the
names
given
to
the
different
parts
of
baiame
body
at
first
so
the
clans
were
in
a
sense
the
fragments
of
the
divine
body
now
is
this
not
just
another
way
of
saying
that
the
great
god
is
the
synthesis
of
all
the
totems
and
consequently
the
personification
of
the
tribal
unity
but
at
the
same
time
it
takes
an
international
character
in
fact
the
members
of
the
tribe
to
which
the
young
initiates
belong
are
not
the
only
ones
who
assist
at
the
ceremonies
of
initiation
representatives
from
the
neighbouring
tribes
are
specially
summoned
to
these
celebrations
which
thus
become
sorts
of
international
fairs
at
once
religious
and
laical
beliefs
elaborated
in
social
environments
thus
constituted
could
not
remain
the
exclusive
patrimony
of
any
special
nationality
the
stranger
to
whom
they
are
revealed
carries
them
back
to
his
own
tribe
when
he
returns
home
and
as
sooner
or
later
he
is
forced
to
invite
his
former
hosts
there
is
a
continual
exchange
of
ideas
from
tribe
to
tribe
it
is
thus
that
an
international
mythology
was
established
of
which
the
great
god
was
quite
naturally
the
essential
element
for
it
had
its
origin
in
the
rites
of
initiation
which
it
is
his
function
to
personify
so
his
name
passed
from
one
language
to
another
along
with
the
representations
which
were
attached
to
it
the
fact
that
the
names
of
the
phratries
are
generally
the
same
in
very
different
tribes
could
not
fail
to
facilitate
this
diffusion
the
internationalism
of
the
totems
opened
the
way
for
that
of
the
great
god
v
we
thus
reach
the
highest
conception
to
which
totemism
has
arrived
this
is
the
point
where
it
touches
and
prepares
the
religions
which
are
to
follow
and
aids
us
in
understanding
them
but
at
the
same
time
we
are
able
to
see
that
this
culminating
idea
is
united
without
any
interruption
to
the
crudest
beliefs
which
we
analysed
to
start
with
in
fact
the
great
tribal
god
is
only
an
ancestral
spirit
who
finally
won
a
place
the
ancestral
spirits
are
only
entities
forged
in
the
image
of
the
individual
souls
whose
origin
they
are
destined
to
explain
the
souls
in
their
turn
are
only
the
form
taken
by
the
impersonal
forces
which
we
found
at
the
basis
of
totemism
as
they
individualize
themselves
in
the
human
body
the
unity
of
the
system
is
as
great
as
its
complexity
in
this
work
of
elaboration
the
idea
of
the
soul
has
undoubtedly
played
an
important
part
it
is
through
it
that
the
idea
of
personality
has
been
introduced
into
the
domain
of
religion
but
it
is
not
true
that
as
the
theorists
of
animism
maintain
it
contains
the
germ
of
the
whole
religion
first
of
all
it
presupposes
the
notion
of
or
the
totemic
principle
of
which
it
is
only
a
special
form
then
if
the
spirits
and
gods
could
not
be
conceived
before
the
soul
they
are
nevertheless
more
than
mere
human
souls
liberated
by
death
else
whence
would
come
their
supernatural
powers
the
idea
of
the
soul
has
merely
served
to
direct
the
mythological
imagination
in
a
new
way
and
to
suggest
to
it
constructions
of
a
new
sort
but
the
matter
for
these
conceptions
has
been
taken
not
from
the
representation
of
the
soul
but
from
this
reservoir
of
the
anonymous
and
diffused
forces
which
constitute
the
original
foundation
of
religions
the
creation
of
mythical
personalities
has
only
been
another
way
of
thinking
of
these
essential
forces
as
for
the
notion
of
the
great
god
it
is
due
entirely
to
the
sentiment
whose
action
we
have
already
observed
in
the
genesis
of
the
most
specifically
totemic
beliefs
this
is
the
tribal
sentiment
in
fact
we
have
seen
that
totemism
was
not
the
work
of
isolated
clans
but
that
it
was
always
elaborated
in
the
body
of
a
tribe
which
was
to
some
degree
conscious
of
its
unity
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
different
cults
peculiar
to
each
clan
mutually
touch
and
complete
each
other
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
unified
whole
now
it
is
this
same
sentiment
of
a
tribal
unity
which
is
expressed
in
the
conception
of
a
supreme
god
common
to
the
tribe
as
a
whole
so
they
are
quite
the
same
causes
which
are
active
at
the
bottom
and
at
the
top
of
this
religious
system
however
up
to
the
present
we
have
considered
the
religious
representations
as
if
they
were
and
could
be
explained
by
themselves
but
in
reality
they
are
inseparable
from
the
rites
not
only
because
they
manifest
themselves
there
but
also
because
they
in
their
turn
feel
the
influence
of
these
of
course
the
cult
depends
upon
the
beliefs
but
it
also
reacts
upon
them
so
in
order
to
understand
them
better
it
is
important
to
understand
it
better
the
moment
has
come
for
undertaking
its
study
book
iii
the
principal
ritual

chapter
i
the
negative
cult
and
its
functions
the
ascetic
rites
we
do
not
have
the
intention
of
attempting
a
complete
description
of
the
primitive
cult
in
what
is
to
follow
being
preoccupied
especially
with
reaching
that
which
is
most
elementary
and
most
fundamental
in
the
religious
life
we
shall
not
attempt
to
reconstruct
in
detail
the
frequently
confused
multiplicity
of
all
the
ritual
forms
but
out
of
the
midst
of
this
extreme
diversity
of
practices
we
should
like
to
touch
upon
the
most
characteristic
attitudes
which
the
primitive
observes
in
the
celebration
of
his
cult
to
classify
the
most
general
forms
of
his
rites
and
to
determine
their
origins
and
significance
in
order
that
we
may
control
and
if
there
is
occasion
make
more
definite
the
results
to
which
the
analysis
of
the
beliefs
has
led
us
every
cult
presents
a
double
aspect
one
negative
the
other
positive
in
reality
of
course
the
two
sorts
of
rites
which
we
denominate
thus
are
closely
associated
we
shall
see
that
they
suppose
one
another
but
still
they
are
different
and
if
it
is
only
to
understand
their
connection
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
them
i
by
definition
sacred
beings
are
separated
beings
that
which
characterizes
them
is
that
there
is
a
break
of
continuity
between
them
and
the
profane
beings
normally
the
first
are
outside
the
others
a
whole
group
of
rites
has
the
object
of
realizing
this
state
of
separation
which
is
essential
since
their
function
is
to
prevent
undue
mixings
and
to
keep
one
of
these
two
domains
from
encroaching
upon
the
other
they
are
only
able
to
impose
abstentions
or
negative
acts
therefore
we
propose
to
give
the
name
negative
cult
to
the
system
formed
by
these
special
rites
they
do
not
prescribe
certain
acts
to
the
faithful
but
confine
themselves
to
forbidding
certain
ways
of
acting
so
they
all
take
the
form
of
interdictions
or
as
is
commonly
said
by
ethnographers
of
this
latter
word
is
the
one
used
in
the
polynesian
languages
to
designate
the
institution
in
virtue
of
which
certain
things
are
withdrawn
from
common
use
it
is
also
an
adjective
expressing
the
distinctive
characteristic
of
these
kinds
of
things
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
show
how
hard
it
is
to
translate
a
strictly
local
and
dialectical
expression
like
this
into
a
generic
term
there
is
no
religion
where
there
are
no
interdictions
and
where
they
do
not
play
a
considerable
part
so
it
is
regrettable
that
the
consecrated
terminology
should
seem
to
make
so
universal
an
institution
into
a
peculiarity
of
polynesia
the
expression
or
seems
to
us
to
be
much
more
preferable
however
the
word
taboo
like
the
word
totem
is
so
customary
that
it
would
show
an
excess
of
purism
to
prohibit
it
systematically
also
the
inconveniences
it
may
have
are
attenuated
when
its
real
meaning
and
importance
have
once
been
definitely
stated
but
there
are
interdictions
of
different
sorts
which
it
is
important
to
distinguish
for
we
shall
not
have
to
treat
all
kinds
of
interdictions
in
this
chapter
first
of
all
beside
those
coming
from
religion
there
are
others
which
are
due
to
magic
the
two
have
this
in
common
that
they
declare
certain
things
incompatible
and
prescribe
the
separation
of
the
things
whose
incompatibility
is
thus
proclaimed
but
there
are
also
very
grave
differences
between
them
in
the
first
place
the
sanctions
are
not
the
same
in
the
two
cases
of
course
the
violation
of
the
religious
interdicts
is
frequently
believed
as
we
shall
presently
see
to
bring
about
material
disorders
mechanically
from
which
the
guilty
man
will
suffer
and
which
are
regarded
as
a
judgment
on
his
act
but
even
if
these
really
come
about
this
spontaneous
and
automatic
judgment
is
not
the
only
one
it
is
always
completed
by
another
one
supposing
human
intervention
a
real
punishment
is
added
to
this
if
it
does
not
anticipate
it
and
this
one
is
deliberately
inflicted
by
men
or
at
least
there
is
a
blame
and
public
reprobation
even
when
the
sacrilege
has
been
punished
as
it
were
by
the
sickness
or
natural
death
of
its
author
it
is
also
defamed
it
offends
opinion
which
reacts
against
it
it
puts
the
man
who
did
it
in
fault
on
the
contrary
the
magic
interdiction
is
judged
only
by
the
material
consequences
which
the
forbidden
act
is
believed
to
produce
with
a
sort
of
physical
necessity
in
disobeying
a
man
runs
risks
similar
to
those
to
which
an
invalid
exposes
himself
in
not
following
the
advice
of
his
physician
but
in
this
case
disobedience
is
not
a
fault
it
creates
no
indignation
there
is
no
sin
in
magic
moreover
this
difference
in
sanction
is
due
to
a
profound
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
interdictions
the
religious
interdiction
necessarily
implies
the
notion
of
sacredness
it
comes
from
the
respect
inspired
by
the
sacred
object
and
its
purpose
is
to
keep
this
respect
from
failing
on
the
other
hand
the
interdictions
of
magic
suppose
only
a
wholly
lay
notion
of
property
the
things
which
the
magician
recommends
to
be
kept
separate
are
those
which
by
reason
of
their
characteristic
properties
can
not
be
brought
together
and
confused
without
danger
even
if
he
happens
to
ask
his
clients
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
certain
sacred
things
it
is
not
through
respect
for
them
and
fear
that
they
may
be
profaned
for
as
we
know
magic
lives
on
profanations
it
is
merely
for
reasons
of
temporal
utility
in
a
word
religious
interdictions
are
categorical
imperatives
others
are
useful
maxims
the
first
form
of
hygienic
and
medical
interdictions
we
can
not
study
two
orders
of
facts
as
different
as
these
simultaneously
or
even
under
the
same
name
without
confusion
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
religious
interdictions
here
but
a
new
distinction
is
necessary
between
these
latter
there
are
religious
interdictions
whose
object
is
to
separate
two
sacred
things
of
different
species
from
each
other
for
example
it
will
be
remembered
that
among
the
wakelbura
the
scaffold
upon
which
the
corpse
is
exposed
must
be
made
exclusively
of
materials
belonging
to
the
phratry
of
the
dead
man
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
all
contact
between
the
corpse
which
is
sacred
and
the
things
of
the
other
phratry
which
are
also
sacred
but
differently
is
forbidden
elsewhere
the
arms
which
one
uses
to
hunt
an
animal
with
can
not
be
made
out
of
a
kind
of
wood
that
is
classed
in
the
same
social
group
as
the
animal
itself
but
the
most
important
of
these
interdictions
are
the
ones
which
we
shall
study
in
the
next
chapter
they
are
intended
to
prevent
all
communication
between
the
purely
sacred
and
the
impurely
sacred
between
the
sacredly
auspicious
and
the
sacredly
inauspicious
all
these
interdictions
have
one
common
characteristic
they
come
not
from
the
fact
that
some
things
are
sacred
while
others
are
not
but
from
the
fact
that
there
are
inequalities
and
incompatibilities
between
sacred
things
so
they
do
not
touch
what
is
essential
in
the
idea
of
sacredness
the
observance
of
these
prohibitions
can
give
place
only
to
isolated
rites
which
are
particular
and
almost
exceptional
but
it
could
not
make
a
real
cult
for
before
all
a
cult
is
made
by
regular
relations
between
the
profane
and
the
sacred
as
such
but
there
is
another
system
of
religious
interdictions
which
is
much
more
extended
and
important
this
is
the
one
which
separates
not
different
species
of
sacred
things
but
all
that
is
sacred
from
all
that
is
profane
so
it
is
derived
immediately
from
the
notion
of
sacredness
itself
and
it
limits
itself
to
expressing
and
realizing
this
thus
it
furnishes
the
material
for
a
veritable
cult
and
even
of
a
cult
which
is
at
the
basis
of
all
the
others
for
the
attitude
which
it
prescribes
is
one
from
which
the
worshipper
must
never
depart
in
all
his
relations
with
the
sacred
it
is
what
we
call
the
negative
cult
we
may
say
that
its
interdicts
are
the
religious
interdicts
it
is
only
these
that
we
shall
discuss
in
the
following
pages
but
they
take
multiple
forms
here
are
the
principal
ones
which
we
observe
in
australia
before
all
are
the
interdictions
of
contact
these
are
the
original
taboos
of
which
the
others
are
scarcely
more
than
particular
varieties
they
rest
upon
the
principle
that
the
profane
should
never
touch
the
sacred
we
have
seen
already
that
the
uninitiated
may
not
touch
the
churinga
or
the
under
any
circumstances
if
adults
are
allowed
the
free
use
of
them
it
is
because
initiation
has
conferred
a
sacred
character
upon
them
blood
and
especially
that
which
flows
during
the
initiation
has
a
religious
virtue
it
is
under
the
same
interdict
it
is
the
same
with
the
hair
a
dead
man
is
sacred
because
the
soul
which
animated
the
body
stays
with
the
corpse
for
this
reason
it
is
sometimes
forbidden
to
carry
the
bones
of
a
dead
man
about
unless
they
are
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
bark
even
the
place
where
the
death
took
place
should
be
avoided
for
they
believe
that
the
soul
of
the
dead
man
continues
to
haunt
the
spot
that
is
why
they
break
camp
and
move
some
distance
away
in
certain
cases
they
destroy
it
along
with
everything
it
contains
and
a
certain
time
must
elapse
before
they
can
come
back
to
the
same
place
thus
it
comes
about
that
a
dying
man
creates
an
empty
space
about
him
they
abandon
him
after
they
have
installed
him
as
comfortably
as
possible
an
exceptionally
intimate
contact
is
the
one
resulting
from
the
absorption
of
food
hence
comes
the
interdiction
against
eating
the
sacred
animals
or
vegetables
and
especially
those
serving
as
totems
such
an
act
appears
so
very
sacrilegious
that
the
prohibition
covers
even
adults
or
at
least
the
majority
of
them
only
the
old
men
attain
a
sufficient
religious
dignity
to
escape
this
interdict
sometimes
this
prohibition
has
sometimes
been
explained
by
the
mythical
kinship
uniting
the
man
to
the
animals
whose
name
he
bears
they
are
protected
by
the
sentiment
of
sympathy
which
they
inspire
by
their
position
as
kin
but
the
fact
that
the
consumption
of
the
forbidden
flesh
is
believed
to
cause
sickness
or
death
automatically
shows
that
this
interdiction
does
not
have
its
origin
in
the
simple
revolt
of
the
feeling
of
domestic
relationship
forces
of
another
sort
are
in
action
which
are
analogous
to
those
in
all
religions
and
which
are
believed
to
react
against
sacrileges
moreover
if
certain
foods
are
forbidden
to
the
profane
because
they
are
sacred
certain
others
on
the
contrary
are
forbidden
to
persons
of
a
sacred
character
because
they
are
profane
thus
it
frequently
happens
that
certain
animals
are
specially
designated
as
the
food
of
women
for
this
reason
they
believe
that
they
partake
of
a
feminine
nature
and
that
they
are
consequently
profane
on
the
other
hand
the
young
initiate
is
submitted
to
a
series
of
rites
of
particular
severity
to
give
him
the
virtues
which
will
enable
him
to
enter
into
the
world
of
sacred
things
from
which
he
had
up
till
then
been
excluded
they
centre
an
exceptionally
powerful
group
of
religious
forces
upon
him
thus
he
enters
into
a
state
of
sanctity
which
keeps
all
that
is
profane
at
a
distance
then
he
is
not
allowed
to
eat
the
game
which
is
regarded
as
the
special
food
of
women
but
contact
may
be
established
by
other
means
than
the
touch
one
comes
into
relations
with
a
thing
by
merely
regarding
it
a
look
is
a
means
of
contact
this
is
why
the
sight
of
sacred
things
is
forbidden
to
the
profane
in
certain
cases
a
woman
should
never
see
the
instruments
of
the
cult
the
most
that
is
permitted
her
is
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
them
from
afar
it
is
the
same
with
the
totemic
paintings
executed
on
the
bodies
of
the
officiants
in
the
exceptionally
important
ceremonies
the
exceptional
solemnity
of
the
rites
of
initiation
prevents
the
women
in
certain
tribes
from
seeing
the
place
where
they
were
celebrated
or
even
the
neophyte
himself
the
sacred
character
which
is
imminent
in
the
ceremony
as
a
whole
is
naturally
found
in
the
persons
of
those
who
directed
it
or
took
some
part
in
it
the
result
of
this
is
that
the
novice
may
not
raise
his
eyes
to
them
and
this
interdiction
continues
even
after
the
rite
is
accomplished
a
dead
man
is
also
removed
from
view
sometimes
his
face
is
covered
over
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
not
be
seen
the
word
is
another
way
of
entering
into
relations
with
persons
or
things
the
breath
expired
establishes
a
communication
this
is
a
part
of
us
which
spreads
outwards
thus
it
is
forbidden
to
the
profane
to
address
the
sacred
beings
or
simply
to
speak
in
their
presence
just
as
the
neophyte
must
not
regard
either
the
operators
or
the
assistants
so
it
is
forbidden
to
him
to
converse
with
them
except
by
signs
and
this
interdiction
keeps
the
place
to
which
it
has
been
raised
by
means
of
a
special
rite
in
a
general
way
there
are
among
the
arunta
moments
in
the
course
of
the
great
ceremonies
when
silence
is
obligatory
as
soon
as
the
churinga
are
exposed
every
one
keeps
still
or
if
someone
talks
he
does
so
in
a
low
voice
or
with
his
lips
only
besides
the
sacred
things
there
are
words
and
sounds
which
have
the
same
character
they
should
not
pass
the
lips
of
the
profane
or
enter
their
ears
there
are
ritual
songs
which
women
must
not
hear
under
pain
of
death
they
may
hear
the
noise
of
the
but
only
from
a
distance
every
proper
name
is
considered
an
essential
element
of
the
person
who
bears
it
being
closely
associated
in
the
mind
to
the
idea
of
this
person
it
participates
in
the
sentiments
which
this
latter
inspires
so
if
the
one
is
sacred
the
other
is
therefore
it
may
not
be
pronounced
in
the
course
of
the
profane
life
among
the
warramunga
there
is
one
totem
which
is
particularly
venerated
this
is
the
snake
called
wollunqua
its
name
is
taboo
it
is
the
same
with
baiame
daramulun
and
bunjil
the
esoteric
form
of
their
name
must
not
be
revealed
to
the
uninitiate
during
mourning
the
name
of
the
dead
man
must
not
be
mentioned
at
least
by
his
parents
except
when
there
is
an
absolute
necessity
and
even
in
this
case
it
must
be
whispered
this
interdiction
is
frequently
perpetual
for
the
widow
and
certain
relatives
among
certain
peoples
this
even
extends
beyond
the
family
all
the
individuals
whose
name
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
dead
man
must
change
theirs
temporarily
but
there
is
more
than
this
the
relatives
and
intimate
friends
sometimes
abstain
from
certain
words
in
the
usual
language
undoubtedly
because
they
were
employed
by
the
dead
man
these
gaps
are
filled
in
by
means
of
periphrases
or
words
taken
from
some
foreign
dialects
in
addition
to
their
public
and
everyday
names
all
men
have
another
which
is
kept
a
secret
the
women
and
children
do
not
know
it
it
is
never
used
in
the
ordinary
life
this
is
because
it
has
a
religious
character
there
are
even
ceremonies
during
which
it
is
necessary
to
speak
a
special
language
which
must
not
be
used
for
profane
purposes
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
sacred
language
not
only
are
the
sacred
beings
separated
from
the
profane
but
also
nothing
which
either
directly
or
indirectly
concerns
the
profane
life
should
be
confused
with
the
religious
life
complete
nudity
is
frequently
demanded
of
the
native
as
a
prerequisite
to
being
admitted
to
participation
in
the
rites
he
is
required
to
strip
himself
of
all
his
habitual
ornaments
even
those
to
which
he
is
the
most
attached
and
from
which
he
separates
himself
the
least
willingly
because
of
the
protecting
virtues
he
attributes
to
them
if
he
is
obliged
to
decorate
himself
to
play
his
part
in
the
ritual
this
decoration
has
to
be
made
specially
for
the
occasion
it
is
a
ceremonial
costume
a
gala
dress
as
these
ornaments
are
sacred
owing
to
the
use
made
of
them
he
is
forbidden
to
use
them
in
profane
affairs
when
the
ceremony
is
finished
they
are
buried
or
burnt
the
men
must
even
wash
themselves
in
such
a
way
as
to
carry
away
with
them
no
trace
of
the
decorations
with
which
they
were
adorned
in
general
all
acts
characteristic
of
the
ordinary
life
are
forbidden
while
those
of
the
religious
life
are
taking
place
the
act
of
eating
is
of
itself
profane
for
it
takes
place
every
day
it
satisfies
essentially
utilitarian
and
material
needs
and
it
is
a
part
of
our
ordinary
existence
this
is
why
it
is
prohibited
in
religious
times
when
one
totemic
group
has
loaned
its
churinga
to
a
foreign
clan
it
is
an
exceptionally
solemn
moment
when
they
are
brought
back
and
put
into
the
ertnatulunga
all
those
who
take
part
in
the
ceremony
must
fast
as
long
as
it
lasts
and
it
lasts
a
long
time
the
same
rule
is
observed
during
the
rites
of
which
we
shall
speak
in
the
next
chapter
as
well
as
at
certain
moments
of
the
initiation
for
this
same
reason
all
temporal
occupations
are
suspended
while
the
great
religious
solemnities
are
taking
place
according
to
a
remark
of
spencer
and
gillen
which
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
cite
the
life
of
the
australian
is
divided
into
two
very
distinct
parts
the
one
is
devoted
to
hunting
fishing
and
warfare
the
other
is
consecrated
to
the
cult
and
these
two
forms
of
activity
mutually
exclude
and
repel
one
another
it
is
on
this
principle
that
the
universal
institution
of
religious
days
of
rest
reposes
the
distinctive
character
of
the
in
all
known
religions
is
the
cessation
of
work
and
the
suspension
of
public
and
private
life
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
have
a
religious
objective
this
repose
is
not
merely
a
sort
of
temporary
relaxation
which
men
have
given
themselves
in
order
to
give
themselves
up
more
freely
to
the
sentiments
of
joy
ordinarily
awakened
by
the
for
they
are
sad
feasts
consecrated
to
mourning
and
repentance
and
during
which
this
cessation
is
no
less
obligatory
this
is
because
work
is
an
eminent
form
of
profane
activity
it
has
no
other
apparent
end
than
to
provide
for
the
temporal
necessities
of
life
it
puts
us
in
relations
with
ordinary
things
only
on
feast
days
on
the
contrary
the
religious
life
attains
an
exceptional
degree
of
intensity
so
the
contrast
between
the
two
forms
of
existence
is
especially
marked
at
this
moment
consequently
they
can
not
remain
near
to
each
other
a
man
can
not
approach
his
god
intimately
while
he
still
bears
on
him
marks
of
his
profane
life
inversely
he
can
not
return
to
his
usual
occupations
when
a
rite
has
just
sanctified
him
so
the
ritual
day
of
rest
is
only
one
particular
case
of
the
general
incompatibility
separating
the
sacred
from
the
profane
it
is
the
result
of
an
interdiction
it
would
be
impossible
to
enumerate
here
all
the
different
interdictions
which
have
been
observed
even
in
the
australian
religions
alone
like
the
notion
of
sacredness
upon
which
it
rests
the
system
of
interdicts
extends
into
the
most
diverse
relations
it
is
even
used
deliberately
for
utilitarian
ends
but
howsoever
complex
it
may
be
it
finally
rests
upon
two
fundamental
interdictions
which
summarize
it
and
dominate
it
in
the
first
place
the
religious
life
and
the
profane
life
can
not
coexist
in
the
same
place
if
the
former
is
to
develop
a
special
spot
must
be
placed
at
its
disposition
from
which
the
second
is
excluded
hence
comes
the
founding
of
temples
and
sanctuaries
these
are
the
spots
awarded
to
sacred
beings
and
things
and
serve
them
as
residences
for
they
can
not
establish
themselves
in
any
place
except
on
the
condition
of
entirely
appropriating
to
themselves
all
within
a
certain
distance
such
arrangements
are
so
indispensable
to
all
religious
life
that
even
the
most
inferior
religions
can
not
do
without
them
the
ertnatulunga
the
spot
where
the
churinga
are
deposited
is
a
veritable
sanctuary
so
the
uninitiated
are
not
allowed
to
approach
it
it
is
even
forbidden
to
carry
on
any
profane
occupation
whatsoever
there
as
we
shall
presently
see
there
are
other
holy
places
where
important
ceremonies
are
celebrated
likewise
the
religious
life
and
the
profane
life
can
not
coexist
in
the
same
unit
of
time
it
is
necessary
to
assign
determined
days
or
periods
to
the
first
from
which
all
profane
occupations
are
excluded
thus
feast
days
are
born
there
is
no
religion
and
consequently
no
society
which
has
not
known
and
practised
this
division
of
time
into
two
distinct
parts
alternating
with
one
another
according
to
a
law
varying
with
the
peoples
and
the
civilizations
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
it
was
probably
the
necessity
of
this
alternation
which
led
men
to
introduce
into
the
continuity
and
homogeneity
of
duration
certain
distinctions
and
differentiations
which
it
does
not
naturally
have
of
course
it
is
almost
impossible
that
the
religious
life
should
ever
succeed
in
concentrating
itself
hermetically
in
the
places
and
times
which
are
thus
attributed
to
it
it
is
inevitable
that
a
little
of
it
should
filter
out
there
are
always
some
sacred
things
outside
the
sanctuaries
there
are
some
rites
that
can
be
celebrated
on
but
these
are
sacred
things
of
the
second
rank
and
rites
of
a
lesser
importance
concentration
remains
the
dominating
characteristic
of
this
organization
generally
this
concentration
is
complete
for
all
that
concerns
the
public
cult
which
can
not
be
celebrated
except
in
common
the
individual
private
cult
is
the
only
one
which
comes
very
near
to
the
temporal
life
thus
the
contrast
between
these
two
successive
phases
of
human
life
attains
its
maximum
of
intensity
in
the
inferior
societies
for
it
is
there
that
the
individual
cult
is
the
most
rudimentary
ii
up
to
the
present
the
negative
cult
has
been
presented
to
us
only
as
a
system
of
abstentions
so
it
seems
to
serve
only
to
inhibit
activity
and
not
to
stimulate
it
or
to
modify
it
and
yet
as
an
unexpected
reaction
to
this
inhibitive
effect
it
is
found
to
exercise
a
positive
action
of
the
highest
importance
over
the
religious
and
moral
nature
of
the
individual
in
fact
owing
to
the
barrier
which
separates
the
sacred
from
the
profane
a
man
can
not
enter
into
intimate
relations
with
sacred
things
except
after
ridding
himself
of
all
that
is
profane
in
him
he
can
not
lead
a
religious
life
of
even
a
slight
intensity
unless
he
commences
by
withdrawing
more
or
less
completely
from
the
temporal
life
so
the
negative
cult
is
in
one
sense
a
means
in
view
of
an
end
it
is
a
condition
of
access
to
the
positive
cult
it
does
not
confine
itself
to
protecting
sacred
beings
from
vulgar
contact
it
acts
upon
the
worshipper
himself
and
modifies
his
condition
positively
the
man
who
has
submitted
himself
to
its
prescribed
interdictions
is
not
the
same
afterwards
as
he
was
before
before
he
was
an
ordinary
being
who
for
this
reason
had
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
the
religious
forces
afterwards
he
is
on
a
more
equal
footing
with
them
he
has
approached
the
sacred
by
the
very
act
of
leaving
the
profane
he
has
purified
and
sanctified
himself
by
the
very
act
of
detaching
himself
from
the
base
and
trivial
matters
that
debased
his
nature
so
the
negative
rites
confer
efficient
powers
just
as
well
as
the
positive
ones
the
first
like
the
second
can
serve
to
elevate
the
religious
tone
of
the
individual
according
to
a
very
true
remark
which
has
been
made
no
one
can
engage
in
a
religious
ceremony
of
any
importance
without
first
submitting
himself
to
a
sort
of
preliminary
initiation
which
introduces
him
progressively
into
the
sacred
world
unctions
lustrations
benedictions
or
any
essentially
positive
operation
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
but
the
same
result
may
be
attained
by
means
of
fasts
and
vigils
or
retreat
and
silence
that
is
to
say
by
ritual
abstinences
which
are
nothing
more
than
certain
interdictions
put
into
practice
when
there
are
only
particular
and
isolated
negative
rites
their
positive
action
is
generally
too
slight
to
be
easily
perceptible
but
there
are
circumstances
when
a
whole
system
of
interdictions
is
concentrated
on
one
man
in
these
cases
their
effects
accumulate
and
thus
become
more
manifest
this
takes
place
in
australia
at
the
time
of
the
initiation
the
neophyte
is
submitted
to
a
great
variety
of
negative
rites
he
must
withdraw
from
the
society
in
which
his
existence
has
been
passed
up
till
then
and
from
almost
all
human
society
not
only
is
it
forbidden
for
him
to
see
women
and
uninitiated
persons
but
he
also
goes
to
live
in
the
brush
far
from
his
fellows
under
the
direction
of
some
old
men
who
serve
him
as
godfathers
so
very
true
is
it
that
the
forest
is
considered
his
natural
environment
that
in
a
certain
number
of
tribes
the
word
with
which
the
initiation
is
designated
signifies
which
is
from
the
for
this
same
reason
he
is
frequently
decorated
with
leaves
during
the
ceremonies
at
which
he
assists
in
this
way
he
passes
long
months
interspersed
from
time
to
time
with
rites
in
which
he
must
take
a
part
this
time
is
a
period
of
all
sorts
of
abstinences
for
him
a
multitude
of
foods
are
forbidden
him
he
is
allowed
only
that
quantity
of
food
which
is
absolutely
indispensable
for
the
maintenance
of
life
he
is
even
sometimes
bound
to
a
rigorous
fast
or
must
eat
impure
foods
when
he
eats
he
must
not
touch
the
food
with
his
hands
his
godfathers
put
it
into
his
mouth
for
him
in
some
cases
he
must
go
to
beg
his
food
likewise
he
sleeps
only
as
much
as
is
indispensable
he
must
abstain
from
talking
to
the
extent
of
not
uttering
a
word
it
is
by
signs
that
he
makes
known
his
needs
he
must
not
wash
sometimes
he
must
not
move
he
remains
stretched
out
upon
the
earth
immobile
and
without
clothing
of
any
sort
now
the
result
of
the
numerous
interdictions
is
to
bring
about
a
radical
change
of
condition
in
the
initiate
before
the
initiation
he
lived
with
the
women
he
was
excluded
from
the
cult
after
it
he
is
admitted
to
the
society
of
men
he
takes
part
in
the
rites
and
has
acquired
a
sacred
character
the
metamorphosis
is
so
complete
that
it
is
sometimes
represented
as
a
second
birth
they
imagine
that
the
profane
person
who
was
the
young
man
up
till
then
has
died
that
he
has
been
killed
and
carried
away
by
the
god
of
the
initiation
bunjil
baiame
or
daramulun
and
that
quite
another
individual
has
taken
the
place
of
the
one
that
no
longer
is
so
here
we
find
the
very
heart
of
the
positive
effects
of
which
negative
rites
are
capable
of
course
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
these
latter
produced
this
great
transformation
all
by
themselves
but
they
certainly
contributed
to
it
and
largely
in
the
light
of
these
facts
we
are
able
to
understand
what
asceticism
is
what
place
it
occupies
in
the
religious
life
and
whence
come
the
virtues
which
have
generally
been
attributed
to
it
in
fact
there
is
no
interdict
the
observance
of
which
does
not
have
an
ascetic
character
to
a
certain
degree
abstaining
from
something
which
may
be
useful
or
from
a
form
of
activity
which
since
it
is
usual
should
answer
to
some
human
need
is
of
necessity
imposing
constraints
and
renunciations
so
in
order
to
have
real
asceticism
it
is
sufficient
for
these
practices
to
develop
in
such
a
way
as
to
become
the
basis
of
a
veritable
scheme
of
life
normally
the
negative
cult
serves
only
as
an
introduction
and
preparation
for
the
positive
cult
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
it
frees
itself
from
this
subordination
and
passes
to
the
first
place
and
that
the
system
of
interdicts
swells
and
exaggerates
itself
to
the
point
of
usurping
the
entire
existence
thus
a
systematic
asceticism
is
born
which
is
consequently
nothing
more
than
a
hypertrophy
of
the
negative
cult
the
special
virtues
which
it
is
believed
to
confer
are
only
an
amplified
form
of
those
conferred
to
a
lesser
degree
by
the
practice
of
any
interdiction
they
have
the
same
origin
for
they
both
rest
on
the
principle
that
a
man
sanctifies
himself
only
by
efforts
made
to
separate
himself
from
the
profane
the
pure
ascetic
is
a
man
who
raises
himself
above
men
and
acquires
a
special
sanctity
by
fasts
and
vigils
by
retreat
and
silence
or
in
a
word
by
privations
rather
than
by
acts
of
positive
piety
offerings
sacrifices
prayers
history
shows
to
what
a
high
religious
prestige
one
may
attain
by
this
method
the
buddhist
saint
is
essentially
an
ascetic
and
he
is
equal
or
superior
to
the
gods
it
follows
that
asceticism
is
not
a
rare
exceptional
and
nearly
abnormal
fruit
of
the
religious
life
as
some
have
supposed
it
to
be
on
the
contrary
it
is
one
of
its
essential
elements
every
religion
contains
it
at
least
in
germ
for
there
are
none
in
which
a
system
of
interdicts
is
not
found
their
only
difference
in
this
regard
which
there
may
be
between
cults
is
that
this
germ
is
more
or
less
developed
in
different
ones
it
should
also
be
added
that
there
probably
is
not
a
single
one
in
which
this
development
does
not
take
at
least
temporarily
the
characteristic
traits
of
real
asceticism
this
is
what
generally
takes
place
at
certain
critical
periods
when
for
a
relatively
short
time
it
is
necessary
to
bring
about
a
grave
change
of
condition
in
a
subject
then
in
order
to
introduce
him
more
rapidly
into
the
circle
of
sacred
things
with
which
he
must
be
put
in
contact
he
is
separated
violently
from
the
profane
world
but
this
does
not
come
without
many
abstinences
and
an
exceptional
recrudescence
of
the
system
of
interdicts
now
this
is
just
what
happens
in
australia
at
the
moment
of
initiation
in
order
to
transform
youths
into
men
it
is
necessary
to
make
them
live
the
life
of
a
veritable
ascetic
parker
very
justly
calls
them
the
monks
of
baiame
but
abstinences
and
privations
do
not
come
without
suffering
we
hold
to
the
profane
world
by
all
the
fibres
of
our
flesh
our
senses
attach
us
to
it
our
life
depends
upon
it
it
is
not
merely
the
natural
theatre
of
our
activity
it
penetrates
us
from
every
side
it
is
a
part
of
ourselves
so
we
can
not
detach
ourselves
from
it
without
doing
violence
to
our
nature
and
without
painfully
wounding
our
instincts
in
other
words
the
negative
cult
can
not
develop
without
causing
suffering
pain
is
one
of
its
necessary
conditions
some
have
been
led
to
think
of
it
as
constituting
a
sort
of
rite
in
itself
they
have
seen
in
it
a
state
of
grace
which
is
to
be
sought
and
aroused
even
artificially
because
of
the
powers
and
privileges
which
it
confers
in
the
same
way
as
these
systems
of
interdicts
of
which
it
is
the
natural
accompaniment
so
far
as
we
know
preuss
is
the
first
who
has
realized
the
religious
rôle
which
is
attributed
to
suffering
in
the
inferior
societies
he
cites
the
case
of
the
arapahs
who
inflict
veritable
torments
upon
themselves
in
order
to
become
immune
from
the
dangers
of
battle
of
the
big
belly
indians
who
submit
to
actual
tortures
on
the
eve
of
military
expeditions
of
the
hupa
who
swim
in
icy
rivers
and
then
remain
stretched
out
on
the
bank
as
long
as
possible
in
order
to
assure
themselves
of
success
in
their
enterprises
of
the
karaya
who
from
time
to
time
draw
blood
from
their
arms
and
legs
by
means
of
scratches
made
out
of
the
teeth
of
fish
in
order
to
strengthen
their
muscles
of
the
men
of
dallmannhafen
emperor
william
land
in
new
guinea
who
combat
the
sterility
of
their
women
by
making
bloody
incisions
in
the
upper
part
of
their
thighs
but
similar
facts
may
be
found
without
leaving
australia
especially
in
the
course
of
the
initiation
ceremonies
many
of
the
rites
practised
on
this
occasion
consist
in
systematically
inflicting
certain
pains
on
the
neophyte
in
order
to
modify
his
condition
and
to
make
him
acquire
the
qualities
characteristic
of
a
man
thus
among
the
larakia
while
the
young
men
are
in
retreat
in
the
forest
their
godfathers
and
guardians
give
them
violent
blows
at
any
instant
without
warning
and
without
cause
among
the
urabunna
at
a
certain
time
the
novice
is
stretched
out
on
the
ground
his
face
against
the
earth
all
the
men
present
beat
him
rudely
then
they
make
four
or
eight
gashes
on
his
back
arranged
on
each
side
of
the
dorsal
spine
and
one
on
the
meridial
line
of
the
nape
of
his
neck
among
the
arunta
the
first
rite
of
the
initiation
consists
in
tossing
the
subject
in
a
blanket
the
men
throw
him
into
the
air
and
catch
him
when
he
comes
down
to
throw
him
up
again
in
the
same
tribe
at
the
close
of
this
long
series
of
ceremonies
the
young
man
lies
down
on
a
bed
of
leaves
under
which
they
have
placed
live
coals
he
remains
there
immobile
in
the
midst
of
the
heat
and
suffocating
smoke
a
similar
rite
is
observed
among
the
urabunna
but
in
addition
while
the
patient
is
in
this
painful
situation
they
beat
him
on
the
back
in
a
general
way
all
the
exercises
to
which
he
is
submitted
have
this
same
character
to
such
an
extent
that
when
he
is
allowed
to
the
ordinary
life
he
has
a
pitiful
aspect
and
appears
half
stupefied
it
is
true
that
all
these
practices
are
frequently
represented
as
ordeals
destined
to
prove
the
value
of
the
neophyte
and
to
show
whether
he
is
worthy
of
being
admitted
into
the
religious
society
or
not
but
in
reality
the
probational
function
of
the
rite
is
only
another
aspect
of
its
efficacy
for
the
fact
that
it
has
been
undergone
is
proved
by
its
producing
its
effect
that
is
to
say
by
its
conferring
the
qualities
which
are
the
original
reason
for
its
existence
in
other
cases
these
ritual
cruelties
are
executed
not
on
the
organism
as
a
whole
but
on
a
particular
organ
or
tissue
whose
vitality
it
is
their
object
to
stimulate
thus
among
the
arunta
the
warramunga
and
many
other
tribes
at
a
certain
moment
in
the
initiation
certain
persons
are
charged
with
biting
the
novice
severely
in
the
scalp
this
operation
is
so
painful
that
the
patient
can
hardly
support
it
without
uttering
cries
its
object
is
to
make
the
hair
grow
the
same
treatment
is
applied
to
make
the
beard
grow
the
rite
of
pulling
out
hairs
which
howitt
mentions
in
other
tribes
seems
to
have
the
same
reason
for
existence
according
to
eylmann
the
men
and
women
of
the
arunta
and
the
kaitish
make
small
wounds
on
their
arms
with
sticks
red
with
fire
in
order
to
become
skilful
in
making
fire
or
to
acquire
the
strength
necessary
for
carrying
heavy
loads
of
wood
according
to
this
same
observer
the
warramunga
girls
amputate
the
second
and
third
joints
of
the
index
finger
on
one
hand
thinking
that
the
finger
thus
becomes
better
fitted
for
finding
yams
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
extraction
of
teeth
was
sometimes
destined
to
produce
effects
of
this
sort
in
any
case
it
is
certain
that
the
cruel
rites
of
circumcision
and
subincision
have
the
object
of
conferring
particular
powers
on
the
genital
organs
in
fact
the
young
man
is
not
allowed
to
marry
until
after
he
has
undergone
them
so
he
owes
them
special
virtues
what
makes
this
initiation
indispensable
is
that
in
all
inferior
societies
the
union
of
the
sexes
is
marked
with
a
religious
character
it
is
believed
to
put
redoubtable
forces
into
play
which
a
man
can
not
approach
without
danger
until
after
he
has
acquired
the
necessary
immunity
by
ritual
processes
for
this
a
whole
series
of
positive
and
negative
practices
is
used
of
which
circumcision
and
subincision
are
the
forerunners
by
painfully
mutilating
an
organ
a
sacred
character
is
given
to
it
since
by
that
act
it
is
put
into
shape
for
resisting
the
equally
sacred
forces
which
it
could
not
meet
otherwise
at
the
beginning
of
this
work
we
said
that
all
the
essential
elements
of
religious
thought
and
life
ought
to
be
found
at
least
in
germ
in
the
most
primitive
religions
the
preceding
facts
confirm
this
assertion
if
there
is
any
one
belief
which
is
believed
to
be
peculiar
to
the
most
recent
and
idealistic
religions
it
is
the
one
attributing
a
sanctifying
power
to
sorrow
now
this
same
belief
is
at
the
basis
of
the
rites
which
have
just
been
observed
of
course
it
is
understood
differently
at
the
different
moments
of
history
when
it
is
studied
for
the
christian
it
acts
especially
upon
the
soul
it
purges
it
ennobles
it
spiritualizes
it
for
the
australian
it
is
the
body
over
which
it
is
efficient
it
increases
its
vital
energies
it
makes
its
beard
and
hair
grow
it
toughens
its
members
but
in
both
cases
the
principle
is
the
same
in
both
it
is
admitted
that
suffering
creates
exceptional
strength
and
this
belief
is
not
without
foundation
in
fact
it
is
by
the
way
in
which
he
braves
suffering
that
the
greatness
of
a
man
is
best
manifested
he
never
rises
above
himself
with
more
brilliancy
than
when
he
subdues
his
own
nature
to
the
point
of
making
it
follow
a
way
contrary
to
the
one
it
would
spontaneously
take
by
this
he
distinguishes
himself
from
all
the
other
creatures
who
follow
blindly
wherever
pleasure
calls
them
by
this
he
makes
a
place
apart
for
himself
in
the
world
suffering
is
the
sign
that
certain
of
the
bonds
attaching
him
to
his
profane
environment
are
broken
so
it
testifies
that
he
is
partially
freed
from
this
environment
and
consequently
it
is
justly
considered
the
instrument
of
deliverance
so
he
who
is
thus
delivered
is
not
the
victim
of
a
pure
illusion
when
he
believes
himself
invested
with
a
sort
of
mastery
over
things
he
really
has
raised
himself
above
them
by
the
very
act
of
renouncing
them
he
is
stronger
than
nature
because
he
makes
it
subside
moreover
it
is
by
no
means
true
that
this
virtue
has
only
an
æsthetic
value
the
whole
religious
life
supposes
it
sacrifices
and
privations
do
not
come
without
privations
which
cost
the
worshipper
dear
even
if
the
rites
do
not
demand
material
gifts
from
him
they
require
his
time
and
his
strength
in
order
to
serve
his
gods
he
must
forget
himself
to
make
for
them
a
fitting
place
in
his
own
life
he
must
sacrifice
his
profane
interests
the
positive
cult
is
possible
only
when
a
man
is
trained
to
renouncement
to
abnegation
to
detachment
from
self
and
consequently
to
suffering
it
is
necessary
that
he
have
no
dread
of
them
he
can
not
even
fulfil
his
duties
joyfully
unless
he
loves
them
to
some
extent
but
for
that
it
is
necessary
that
he
train
himself
and
it
is
to
this
that
the
ascetic
practices
tend
so
the
suffering
which
they
impose
is
not
arbitrary
and
sterile
cruelty
it
is
a
necessary
school
where
men
form
and
temper
themselves
and
acquire
the
qualities
of
disinterestedness
and
endurance
without
which
there
would
be
no
religion
if
this
result
is
to
be
obtained
it
is
even
a
good
thing
that
the
ascetic
ideal
be
incarnated
eminently
in
certain
persons
whose
speciality
so
to
speak
it
is
to
represent
almost
with
excess
this
aspect
of
the
ritual
life
for
they
are
like
so
many
living
models
inciting
to
effort
such
is
the
historic
rôle
of
the
great
ascetics
when
their
deeds
and
acts
are
analysed
in
detail
one
asks
himself
what
useful
end
they
can
have
he
is
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
is
something
excessive
in
the
disdain
they
profess
for
all
that
ordinarily
impassions
men
but
these
exaggerations
are
necessary
to
sustain
among
the
believers
a
sufficient
disgust
for
an
easy
life
and
common
pleasures
it
is
necessary
that
an
elite
put
the
end
too
high
if
the
crowd
is
not
to
put
it
too
low
it
is
necessary
that
some
exaggerate
if
the
average
is
to
remain
at
a
fitting
level
but
asceticism
does
not
serve
religious
ends
only
here
as
elsewhere
religious
interests
are
only
the
symbolic
form
of
social
and
moral
interests
the
ideal
beings
to
whom
the
cults
are
addressed
are
not
the
only
ones
who
demand
of
their
followers
a
certain
disdain
for
suffering
society
itself
is
possible
only
at
this
price
though
exalting
the
strength
of
man
it
is
frequently
rude
to
individuals
it
necessarily
demands
perpetual
sacrifices
from
them
it
is
constantly
doing
violence
to
our
natural
appetites
just
because
it
raises
us
above
ourselves
if
we
are
going
to
fulfil
our
duties
towards
it
then
we
must
be
prepared
to
do
violence
to
our
instincts
sometimes
and
to
ascend
the
decline
of
nature
when
it
is
necessary
so
there
is
an
asceticism
which
being
inherent
in
all
social
life
is
destined
to
survive
all
the
mythologies
and
all
the
dogmas
it
is
an
integral
part
of
all
human
culture
at
bottom
this
is
the
asceticism
which
is
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
and
the
justification
of
that
which
has
been
taught
by
the
religions
of
all
times
iii
having
determined
what
the
system
of
interdicts
consists
in
and
what
its
positive
and
negative
functions
are
we
must
now
seek
the
causes
which
have
given
it
birth
in
one
sense
it
is
logically
implied
in
the
very
notion
of
sacredness
all
that
is
sacred
is
the
object
of
respect
and
every
sentiment
of
respect
is
translated
in
him
who
feels
it
by
movements
of
inhibition
in
fact
a
respected
being
is
always
expressed
in
the
consciousness
by
a
representation
which
owing
to
the
emotion
it
inspires
is
charged
with
a
high
mental
energy
consequently
it
is
armed
in
such
a
way
as
to
reject
to
a
distance
every
other
representation
which
denies
it
in
whole
or
in
part
now
the
sacred
world
and
the
profane
world
are
antagonistic
to
each
other
they
correspond
to
two
forms
of
life
which
mutually
exclude
one
another
or
which
at
least
can
not
be
lived
at
the
same
time
with
the
same
intensity
we
can
not
give
ourselves
up
entirely
to
the
ideal
beings
to
whom
the
cult
is
addressed
and
also
to
ourselves
and
our
own
interests
at
the
same
time
we
can
not
devote
ourselves
entirely
to
the
group
and
entirely
to
our
own
egoism
at
once
here
there
are
two
systems
of
conscious
states
which
are
directed
and
which
direct
our
conduct
towards
opposite
poles
so
the
one
having
the
greater
power
of
action
should
tend
to
exclude
the
other
from
the
consciousness
when
we
think
of
holy
things
the
idea
of
a
profane
object
can
not
enter
the
mind
without
encountering
grave
resistance
something
within
us
opposes
itself
to
its
installation
this
is
because
the
representation
of
a
sacred
thing
does
not
tolerate
neighbours
but
this
psychic
antagonism
and
this
mutual
exclusion
of
ideas
should
naturally
result
in
the
exclusion
of
the
corresponding
things
if
the
ideas
are
not
to
coexist
the
things
must
not
touch
each
other
or
have
any
sort
of
relations
this
is
the
very
principle
of
the
interdict
moreover
the
world
of
sacred
things
is
by
definition
a
world
apart
since
it
is
opposed
to
the
profane
world
by
all
the
characteristics
we
have
mentioned
it
must
be
treated
in
its
own
peculiar
way
it
would
be
a
misunderstanding
of
its
nature
and
a
confusion
of
it
with
something
that
it
is
not
to
make
use
of
the
gestures
language
and
attitudes
which
we
employ
in
our
relations
with
ordinary
things
when
we
have
to
do
with
the
things
that
compose
it
we
may
handle
the
former
freely
we
speak
freely
to
vulgar
beings
so
we
do
not
touch
the
sacred
beings
or
we
touch
them
only
with
reserve
we
do
not
speak
in
their
presence
or
we
do
not
speak
the
common
language
there
all
that
is
used
in
our
commerce
with
the
one
must
be
excluded
from
our
commerce
with
the
other
but
if
this
explanation
is
not
inexact
it
is
nevertheless
insufficient
in
fact
there
are
many
beings
which
are
the
objects
of
respect
without
being
protected
by
systems
of
rigorous
interdictions
such
as
those
we
have
just
described
of
course
there
is
a
general
tendency
of
the
mind
to
localize
different
things
in
different
places
especially
when
they
are
incompatible
with
each
other
but
the
profane
environment
and
the
sacred
one
are
not
merely
distinct
but
they
are
also
closed
to
one
another
between
them
there
is
an
abyss
so
there
ought
to
be
some
particular
reason
in
the
nature
of
sacred
things
which
causes
this
exceptional
isolation
and
mutual
exclusion
and
in
fact
by
a
sort
of
contradiction
the
sacred
world
is
inclined
as
it
were
to
spread
itself
into
this
same
profane
world
which
it
excludes
elsewhere
at
the
same
time
that
it
repels
it
it
tends
to
flow
into
it
as
soon
as
it
approaches
this
is
why
it
is
necessary
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
from
one
another
and
to
create
a
sort
of
vacuum
between
them
what
makes
these
precautions
necessary
is
the
extraordinary
contagiousness
of
a
sacred
character
far
from
being
attached
to
the
things
which
are
marked
with
it
it
is
endowed
with
a
sort
of
elusiveness
even
the
most
superficial
or
roundabout
contact
is
sufficient
to
enable
it
to
spread
from
one
object
to
another
religious
forces
are
represented
in
the
mind
in
such
a
way
that
they
always
seem
ready
to
escape
from
the
points
where
they
reside
and
to
enter
everything
passing
within
their
range
the
nanja
tree
where
the
spirit
of
an
ancestor
lives
is
sacred
for
the
individual
who
considers
himself
the
reincarnation
of
this
ancestor
but
every
bird
which
alights
upon
this
tree
participates
in
this
same
nature
it
is
also
forbidden
to
touch
it
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
show
how
simple
contact
with
a
churinga
is
enough
to
sanctify
men
and
things
it
is
also
upon
this
principle
of
the
contagiousness
of
sacredness
that
all
the
rites
of
consecration
repose
the
sanctity
of
the
churinga
is
so
great
that
its
action
is
even
felt
at
a
distance
it
will
be
remembered
how
this
extends
not
only
to
the
cave
where
they
are
kept
but
also
to
the
whole
surrounding
district
to
the
animals
who
take
refuge
there
whom
it
is
forbidden
to
kill
and
to
the
plants
which
grow
there
which
must
not
be
touched
a
snake
totem
has
its
centre
at
a
place
where
there
is
a
the
sacred
character
of
the
totem
is
communicated
to
this
place
to
the
and
even
to
the
water
itself
which
is
forbidden
to
all
the
members
of
the
totemic
group
the
initiate
lives
in
an
atmosphere
charged
with
religiousness
and
it
is
as
though
he
were
impregnated
with
it
himself
consequently
all
that
he
possesses
and
all
that
he
touches
is
forbidden
to
the
women
and
withdrawn
from
their
contact
even
down
to
the
bird
he
has
struck
with
his
stick
the
kangaroo
he
has
pierced
with
his
lance
or
the
fish
which
has
bit
on
his
hook
but
on
the
other
hand
the
rites
to
which
he
is
submitted
and
the
things
which
have
a
part
in
them
have
a
sanctity
superior
to
his
own
this
sanctity
is
contagiously
transmitted
to
everything
which
evokes
the
idea
of
one
or
the
other
the
tooth
which
has
been
knocked
out
of
him
is
considered
very
holy
for
this
reason
he
may
not
eat
animals
with
prominent
teeth
because
they
make
him
think
of
his
own
lost
tooth
the
ceremonies
of
the
kuringal
terminate
with
a
ritual
washing
acquatic
birds
are
forbidden
to
the
neophyte
because
they
make
him
think
of
this
rite
animals
that
climb
to
the
tops
of
trees
are
equally
sacred
for
him
because
they
are
too
near
to
daramulun
the
god
of
the
initiation
who
lives
in
heaven
the
soul
of
a
dead
man
is
a
sacred
thing
we
have
already
seen
how
this
same
property
passes
to
the
corpse
in
which
the
soul
resided
to
the
spot
where
this
is
buried
to
the
camp
in
which
he
lived
when
alive
and
which
is
either
destroyed
or
quitted
to
the
name
he
bore
to
his
wife
and
to
his
relations
they
too
are
invested
as
it
were
with
a
sacred
character
consequently
men
keep
at
a
distance
from
them
they
do
not
treat
them
as
mere
profane
beings
in
the
societies
observed
by
dawson
their
names
like
that
of
the
dead
man
can
not
be
pronounced
during
the
period
of
mourning
certain
animals
which
he
ate
may
also
be
prohibited
this
contagiousness
of
sacredness
is
too
well
known
a
phenomenon
to
require
any
proof
of
its
existence
from
numerous
examples
we
only
wish
to
show
that
it
is
as
true
in
totemism
as
in
the
more
advanced
religions
when
once
established
it
quickly
explains
the
extreme
rigour
of
the
interdicts
separating
the
sacred
from
the
profane
since
in
virtue
of
this
extraordinary
power
of
expansion
the
slightest
contact
the
least
proximity
either
material
or
simply
moral
suffices
to
draw
religious
forces
out
of
their
domain
and
since
on
the
other
hand
they
can
not
leave
it
without
contradicting
their
nature
a
whole
system
of
measures
is
indispensable
for
maintaining
the
two
worlds
at
a
respectful
distance
from
one
another
this
is
why
it
is
forbidden
to
the
profane
not
only
to
touch
but
even
to
see
or
hear
that
which
is
sacred
and
why
these
two
sorts
of
life
can
not
be
mixed
in
their
consciousnesses
precautions
are
necessary
to
keep
them
apart
because
though
opposing
one
another
they
tend
to
confuse
themselves
into
one
another
when
we
understand
the
multiplicity
of
these
interdicts
we
also
understand
the
way
in
which
they
operate
and
the
sanctions
which
are
attached
to
them
owing
to
the
contagiousness
inherent
in
all
that
is
sacred
a
profane
being
can
not
violate
an
interdict
without
having
the
religious
force
to
which
he
has
unduly
approached
extend
itself
over
him
and
establish
its
empire
over
him
but
as
there
is
an
antagonism
between
them
he
becomes
dependent
upon
a
hostile
power
whose
hostility
can
not
fail
to
manifest
itself
in
the
form
of
violent
reactions
which
tend
to
destroy
him
this
is
why
sickness
or
death
are
considered
the
natural
consequences
of
every
transgression
of
this
sort
and
they
are
consequences
which
are
believed
to
come
by
themselves
with
a
sort
of
physical
necessity
the
guilty
man
feels
himself
attacked
by
a
force
which
dominates
him
and
against
which
he
is
powerless
has
he
eaten
the
totemic
animal
then
he
feels
it
penetrating
him
and
gnawing
at
his
vitals
he
lies
down
on
the
ground
and
awaits
death
every
profanation
implies
a
consecration
but
one
which
is
dreadful
both
for
the
subject
consecrated
and
for
those
who
approach
him
it
is
the
consequences
of
this
consecration
which
sanction
in
part
the
interdict
it
should
be
noticed
that
this
explanation
of
the
interdicts
does
not
depend
upon
the
variable
symbols
by
the
aid
of
which
religious
forces
are
conceived
it
matters
little
whether
these
are
conceived
as
anonymous
and
impersonal
energies
or
figured
as
personalities
endowed
with
consciousness
and
feeling
in
the
former
case
of
course
they
are
believed
to
react
against
profaning
transgressions
in
an
automatic
and
unconscious
manner
while
in
the
latter
case
they
are
thought
to
obey
passionate
movements
determined
by
the
offence
resented
but
at
bottom
these
two
conceptions
which
moreover
have
the
same
practical
effect
only
express
one
and
the
same
psychic
mechanism
in
two
different
languages
the
basis
of
both
is
the
antagonism
of
the
sacred
and
the
profane
combined
with
the
remarkable
aptitude
of
the
former
for
spreading
over
to
the
latter
now
this
antagonism
and
this
contagiousness
act
in
the
same
way
whether
the
sacred
character
is
attributed
to
blind
forces
or
to
conscious
ones
thus
so
far
is
it
from
being
true
that
the
real
religious
life
commences
only
where
there
are
mythical
personalities
that
we
see
that
in
this
case
the
rite
remains
the
same
whether
the
religious
beings
are
personified
or
not
this
is
a
statement
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
repeat
in
each
of
the
chapters
which
follow
iv
but
if
this
contagiousness
of
sacredness
helps
to
explain
the
system
of
interdicts
how
is
it
to
be
explained
itself
some
have
tried
to
explain
it
with
the
laws
of
the
association
of
ideas
the
sentiments
inspired
in
us
by
a
person
or
a
thing
spread
contagiously
from
the
idea
of
this
thing
or
person
to
the
representations
associated
with
it
and
thence
to
the
objects
which
these
representations
express
so
the
respect
which
we
have
for
a
sacred
being
is
communicated
to
everything
touching
this
being
or
resembling
it
or
recalling
it
of
course
a
cultivated
man
is
not
deceived
by
these
associations
he
knows
that
these
derived
emotions
are
due
to
mere
plays
of
the
images
and
to
entirely
mental
combinations
so
he
does
not
give
way
to
the
superstitions
which
these
illusions
tend
to
bring
about
but
they
say
that
the
primitive
naïvely
objectifies
his
impressions
without
criticising
them
does
something
inspire
a
reverential
fear
in
him
he
concludes
that
an
august
and
redoubtable
force
really
resides
in
it
so
he
keeps
at
a
distance
from
this
thing
and
treats
it
as
though
it
were
sacred
even
though
it
has
no
right
to
this
title
but
whoever
says
this
forgets
that
the
most
primitive
religions
are
not
the
only
ones
which
have
attributed
this
power
of
propagation
to
the
sacred
character
even
in
the
most
recent
cults
there
is
a
group
of
rites
which
repose
upon
this
principle
does
not
every
consecration
by
means
of
anointing
or
washing
consist
in
transferring
into
a
profane
object
the
sanctifying
virtues
of
a
sacred
one
yet
it
is
difficult
to
regard
an
enlightened
catholic
of
as
a
sort
of
retarded
savage
who
continues
to
be
deceived
by
his
associations
of
ideas
while
nothing
in
the
nature
of
things
explains
or
justifies
these
ways
of
thinking
moreover
it
is
quite
arbitrarily
that
they
attribute
to
the
primitive
this
tendency
to
objectify
blindly
all
his
emotions
in
his
ordinary
life
and
in
the
details
of
his
lay
occupations
he
does
not
impute
the
properties
of
one
thing
to
its
neighbours
or
if
he
is
less
careful
than
we
are
about
clarity
and
distinction
still
it
is
far
from
true
that
he
has
some
vague
deplorable
aptitude
for
jumbling
and
confusing
everything
religious
thought
alone
has
a
marked
leaning
towards
these
sorts
of
confusions
so
it
is
in
something
special
to
the
nature
of
religious
things
and
not
in
the
general
laws
of
the
human
intelligence
that
the
origin
of
these
predispositions
is
to
be
sought
when
a
force
or
property
seems
to
be
an
integral
part
or
constituent
element
of
the
subject
in
which
it
resides
we
can
not
easily
imagine
its
detaching
itself
and
going
elsewhere
a
body
is
defined
by
its
mass
and
its
atomic
composition
so
we
do
not
think
that
it
could
communicate
any
of
these
distinctive
characteristics
by
means
of
contact
but
on
the
other
hand
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
force
which
has
penetrated
the
body
from
without
since
nothing
attaches
it
there
and
since
it
is
foreign
to
the
body
there
is
nothing
inconceivable
in
its
escaping
again
thus
the
heat
or
electricity
which
a
body
has
received
from
some
external
source
may
be
transmitted
to
the
surrounding
medium
and
the
mind
readily
accepts
the
possibility
of
this
transmission
so
the
extreme
facility
with
which
religious
forces
spread
out
and
diffuse
themselves
has
nothing
surprising
about
it
if
they
are
generally
thought
of
as
outside
of
the
beings
in
which
they
reside
now
this
is
just
what
the
theory
we
have
proposed
implies
in
fact
they
are
only
collective
forces
hypostatized
that
is
to
say
moral
forces
they
are
made
up
of
the
ideas
and
sentiments
awakened
in
us
by
the
spectacle
of
society
and
not
of
sensations
coming
from
the
physical
world
so
they
are
not
homogeneous
with
the
visible
things
among
which
we
place
them
they
may
well
take
from
these
things
the
outward
and
material
forms
in
which
they
are
represented
but
they
owe
none
of
their
efficacy
to
them
they
are
not
united
by
external
bonds
to
the
different
supports
upon
which
they
alight
they
have
no
roots
there
according
to
an
expression
we
have
already
used
and
which
serves
best
for
characterizing
them
are
added
to
so
there
are
no
objects
which
are
predestined
to
receive
them
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
even
the
most
insignificant
and
vulgar
may
do
so
accidental
circumstances
decide
which
are
the
chosen
ones
the
terms
in
which
codrington
speaks
of
the
mana
should
be
borne
in
mind
it
is
a
force
he
says
which
not
fixed
in
anything
and
can
be
conveyed
in
almost
likewise
the
dakota
of
miss
fletcher
represented
the
wakan
as
a
sort
of
surrounding
force
which
is
always
coming
and
going
through
the
world
alighting
here
and
there
but
definitely
fixing
itself
nowhere
even
the
religious
character
inherent
in
men
does
not
have
a
different
character
there
is
certainly
no
other
being
in
the
world
of
experience
which
is
closer
to
the
very
source
of
all
religious
life
none
participates
in
it
more
directly
for
it
is
in
human
consciousnesses
that
it
is
elaborated
yet
we
know
that
the
religious
principle
animating
men
to
wit
the
soul
is
partially
external
but
if
religious
forces
have
a
place
of
their
own
nowhere
their
mobility
is
easily
explained
since
nothing
attaches
them
to
the
things
in
which
we
localize
them
it
is
natural
that
they
should
escape
on
the
slightest
contact
in
spite
of
themselves
so
to
speak
and
that
they
should
spread
afar
their
intensity
incites
them
to
this
spreading
which
everything
favours
this
is
why
the
soul
itself
though
holding
to
the
body
by
very
personal
bonds
is
constantly
threatening
to
leave
it
all
the
apertures
and
pores
of
the
body
are
just
so
many
ways
by
which
it
tends
to
spread
and
diffuse
itself
into
the
outside
but
we
shall
account
for
this
phenomenon
which
we
are
trying
to
understand
still
better
if
instead
of
considering
the
notion
of
religious
forces
as
it
is
when
completely
formulated
we
go
back
to
the
mental
process
from
which
it
results
we
have
seen
in
fact
that
the
sacred
character
of
a
being
does
not
rest
in
any
of
its
intrinsic
attributes
it
is
not
because
the
totemic
animal
has
a
certain
aspect
or
property
that
it
inspires
religious
sentiments
these
result
from
causes
wholly
foreign
to
the
nature
of
the
object
upon
which
they
fix
themselves
what
constitutes
them
are
the
impressions
of
comfort
and
dependence
which
the
action
of
the
society
provokes
in
the
mind
of
themselves
these
emotions
are
not
attached
to
the
idea
of
any
particular
object
but
as
these
emotions
exist
and
are
especially
intense
they
are
also
eminently
contagious
so
they
make
a
stain
of
oil
they
extend
to
all
the
other
mental
states
which
occupy
the
mind
they
penetrate
and
contaminate
those
representations
especially
in
which
are
expressed
the
various
objects
which
the
man
had
in
his
hands
or
before
his
eyes
at
the
moment
the
totemic
designs
covering
his
body
the
which
he
was
making
roar
the
rocks
surrounding
him
the
ground
under
his
feet
etc
it
is
thus
that
the
objects
themselves
get
a
religious
value
which
is
really
not
inherent
in
them
but
is
conferred
from
without
so
the
contagion
is
not
a
sort
of
secondary
process
by
which
sacredness
is
propagated
after
it
has
once
been
acquired
it
is
the
very
process
by
which
it
is
acquired
it
is
by
contagion
that
it
establishes
itself
we
should
not
be
surprised
therefore
if
it
transmits
itself
contagiously
what
makes
its
reality
is
a
special
emotion
if
it
attaches
itself
to
some
object
it
is
because
this
emotion
has
found
this
object
in
its
way
so
it
is
natural
that
from
this
one
it
should
spread
to
all
those
which
it
finds
in
its
neighbourhood
that
is
to
say
to
all
those
which
any
reason
whatsoever
either
material
contiguity
or
mere
similarity
has
mentally
connected
with
the
first
thus
the
contagiousness
of
sacredness
finds
its
explanation
in
the
theory
which
we
have
proposed
of
religious
forces
and
by
this
very
fact
it
serves
to
confirm
our
theory
and
at
the
same
time
it
aids
us
in
understanding
a
trait
of
primitive
mentality
to
which
we
have
already
called
the
attention
we
have
seen
the
facility
with
which
the
primitive
confuses
kingdoms
and
identifies
the
most
heterogeneous
things
men
animals
plants
stars
etc
now
we
see
one
of
the
causes
which
has
contributed
the
most
to
facilitating
these
confusions
since
religious
forces
are
eminently
contagious
it
is
constantly
happening
that
the
same
principle
animates
very
different
objects
equally
it
passes
from
some
into
others
as
the
result
of
either
a
simple
material
proximity
or
of
even
a
superficial
similarity
it
is
thus
that
men
animals
plants
and
rocks
come
to
have
the
same
totem
the
men
because
they
bear
the
name
of
the
animal
the
animals
because
they
bring
the
totemic
emblem
to
mind
the
plants
because
they
nourish
these
animals
the
rocks
because
they
mark
the
place
where
the
ceremonies
are
celebrated
now
religious
forces
are
therefore
considered
the
source
of
all
efficacy
so
beings
having
one
single
religious
principle
ought
to
pass
as
having
the
same
essence
and
as
differing
from
one
another
only
in
secondary
characteristics
this
is
why
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
arrange
them
in
a
single
category
and
to
regard
them
as
mere
varieties
of
the
same
class
transmutable
into
one
another
when
this
relation
has
been
established
it
makes
the
phenomena
of
contagion
appear
under
a
new
aspect
taken
by
themselves
they
seem
to
be
quite
foreign
to
the
logical
life
is
their
effect
not
to
mix
and
confuse
beings
in
spite
of
their
natural
differences
but
we
have
seen
that
these
confusions
and
participation
have
played
a
rôle
of
the
highest
utility
in
logic
they
have
served
to
bind
together
things
which
sensation
leaves
apart
from
one
another
so
it
is
far
from
true
that
contagion
the
source
of
these
connections
and
confusions
is
marked
with
that
fundamental
irrationality
that
one
is
inclined
to
attribute
it
at
first
it
has
opened
the
way
for
the
scientific
explanations
of
the
future

the
positive
cult
elements
of
the
whatever
the
importance
of
the
negative
cult
may
be
and
though
it
may
indirectly
have
positive
effects
it
does
not
contain
its
reason
for
existence
in
itself
it
introduces
one
to
the
religious
life
but
it
supposes
this
more
than
it
constitutes
it
if
it
orders
the
worshipper
to
flee
from
the
profane
world
it
is
to
bring
him
nearer
to
the
sacred
world
men
have
never
thought
that
their
duties
towards
religious
forces
might
be
reduced
to
a
simple
abstinence
from
all
commerce
they
have
always
believed
that
they
upheld
positive
and
bilateral
relations
with
them
whose
regulation
and
organization
is
the
function
of
a
group
of
ritual
practices
to
this
special
system
of
rites
we
give
the
name
of
for
some
time
we
almost
completely
ignored
the
positive
cult
of
the
totemic
religion
and
what
it
consists
in
we
knew
almost
nothing
more
than
the
initiation
rites
and
we
do
not
know
those
sufficiently
well
even
now
but
the
observations
of
spencer
and
gillen
prepared
for
by
those
of
schulze
and
confirmed
by
those
of
strehlow
on
the
tribes
of
central
australia
have
partially
filled
this
gap
in
our
information
there
is
one
ceremony
especially
which
these
explorers
have
taken
particular
pains
to
describe
to
us
and
which
moreover
seems
to
dominate
the
whole
totemic
cult
this
is
the
one
that
the
arunta
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
call
the
it
is
true
that
strehlow
contests
the
meaning
of
this
word
according
to
him
intichiuma
or
as
he
writes
it
means
to
instruct
and
designates
the
ceremonies
performed
before
the
young
man
to
teach
him
the
traditions
of
the
tribe
the
feast
which
we
are
going
to
describe
bears
he
says
the
name
which
means
to
fecundate
or
to
put
into
a
good
condition
but
we
shall
not
try
to
settle
this
question
of
vocabulary
which
touches
the
real
problem
but
slightly
as
the
rites
in
question
are
all
celebrated
in
the
course
of
the
initiation
on
the
other
hand
as
the
word
intichiuma
now
belongs
to
the
current
language
of
ethnography
and
has
almost
become
a
common
noun
it
seems
useless
to
replace
it
with
another
the
date
on
which
the
intichiuma
takes
place
depends
largely
upon
the
season
there
are
two
sharply
separated
seasons
in
australia
one
is
dry
and
lasts
for
a
long
time
the
other
is
rainy
and
is
on
the
contrary
very
short
and
frequently
irregular
as
soon
as
the
rains
arrive
vegetation
springs
up
from
the
ground
as
though
by
enchantment
and
animals
multiply
so
that
the
country
which
had
recently
been
only
a
sterile
desert
is
rapidly
filled
with
a
luxurious
flora
and
fauna
it
is
just
at
the
moment
when
the
good
season
seems
to
be
close
at
hand
that
the
intichiuma
is
celebrated
but
as
the
rainy
season
is
extremely
variable
the
date
of
the
ceremonies
can
not
be
fixed
once
for
all
it
varies
with
the
climatic
circumstances
which
only
the
chief
of
the
totemic
group
the
alatunja
is
qualified
to
judge
on
a
day
which
he
considers
suitable
he
informs
his
companions
that
the
moment
has
arrived
each
totemic
group
has
its
own
intichiuma
even
if
this
rite
is
general
in
the
societies
of
the
centre
it
is
not
the
same
everywhere
among
the
warramunga
it
is
not
what
it
is
among
the
arunta
it
varies
not
only
among
the
tribes
but
also
within
the
tribe
among
the
clans
but
it
is
obvious
that
the
different
mechanisms
in
use
are
too
closely
related
to
each
other
to
be
dissociated
completely
there
is
no
ceremony
perhaps
which
is
not
made
up
of
several
though
these
are
very
unequally
developed
what
exists
only
as
a
germ
in
one
occupies
the
most
important
place
in
another
and
inversely
yet
they
must
be
carefully
distinguished
for
they
constitute
just
so
many
different
ritual
types
to
be
described
and
explained
separately
but
afterwards
we
must
seek
some
common
source
from
which
they
were
derived
let
us
commence
with
those
observed
among
the
arunta
i
the
celebration
includes
two
successive
phases
the
object
of
the
rites
which
take
place
in
the
first
is
to
assure
the
prosperity
of
the
animal
or
vegetable
species
serving
the
clan
as
totem
the
means
employed
for
this
end
may
be
reduced
to
two
principal
types
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
fabulous
ancestors
from
whom
each
clan
is
supposed
to
be
descended
formerly
lived
on
earth
and
left
traces
of
their
passage
there
these
traces
consist
especially
in
stones
and
rocks
which
they
deposited
at
certain
places
or
which
were
formed
at
the
spots
where
they
entered
into
the
ground
these
rocks
and
stones
are
considered
the
bodies
or
parts
of
the
bodies
of
the
ancestors
whose
memory
they
keep
alive
they
represent
them
consequently
they
also
represent
the
animals
and
plants
which
served
these
same
ancestors
as
totems
for
an
individual
and
his
totem
are
only
one
the
same
reality
and
the
same
properties
are
attributed
to
them
as
to
the
actually
living
plants
or
animals
of
the
same
species
but
they
have
this
advantage
over
these
latter
that
they
are
imperishable
knowing
neither
sickness
nor
death
so
they
are
like
a
permanent
immutable
and
reserve
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
also
in
a
certain
number
of
cases
it
is
this
reserve
that
they
annually
draw
upon
to
assure
the
reproduction
of
the
species
here
for
example
is
how
the
witchetty
grub
clan
at
alice
springs
proceeds
at
its
intichiuma
on
the
day
fixed
by
the
chief
all
the
members
of
the
totemic
group
assemble
in
the
principal
camp
the
men
of
the
other
totems
retire
to
a
distance
for
among
the
arunta
they
are
not
allowed
to
be
present
at
the
celebration
of
the
rite
which
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
secret
ceremony
an
individual
of
a
different
totem
but
of
the
same
phratry
may
be
invited
to
be
present
as
a
favour
but
this
is
only
as
a
witness
in
no
case
can
he
take
an
active
part
after
the
men
of
the
totem
have
assembled
they
leave
the
camp
leaving
only
two
or
three
of
their
number
behind
they
advance
in
a
profound
silence
one
behind
another
all
naked
without
arms
and
without
any
of
their
habitual
ornaments
their
attitude
and
their
pace
are
marked
with
a
religious
gravity
this
is
because
the
act
in
which
they
are
taking
part
has
an
exceptional
importance
in
their
eyes
also
until
the
end
of
the
ceremony
they
are
required
to
observe
a
rigorous
fast
the
country
which
they
traverse
is
all
filled
with
souvenirs
left
by
the
glorious
ancestors
thus
they
arrive
at
a
spot
where
a
huge
block
of
quartz
is
found
with
small
round
stones
all
around
it
this
block
represents
the
witchetty
grub
as
an
adult
the
alatunja
strikes
it
with
a
sort
of
wooden
tray
called
and
at
the
same
time
he
intones
a
chant
whose
object
is
to
invite
the
animal
to
lay
eggs
he
proceeds
in
the
same
fashion
with
the
stones
which
are
regarded
as
the
eggs
of
the
animal
and
with
one
of
which
he
rubs
the
stomach
of
each
assistant
this
done
they
all
descend
a
little
lower
to
the
foot
of
a
cliff
also
celebrated
in
the
myths
of
the
alcheringa
at
the
base
of
which
is
another
stone
also
representing
the
witchetty
grub
the
alatunja
strikes
it
with
his
apmara
the
men
accompanying
him
do
so
as
well
with
branches
of
a
which
they
have
gathered
on
the
way
all
of
which
goes
on
in
the
midst
of
chants
renewing
the
invitation
previously
addressed
to
the
animal
about
ten
different
spots
are
visited
in
turn
some
of
which
are
a
mile
or
more
from
the
others
at
each
of
them
there
is
a
stone
at
the
bottom
of
a
cave
or
hole
which
is
believed
to
represent
the
witchetty
grub
in
one
of
his
aspects
or
at
one
of
the
phases
of
his
existence
and
upon
each
of
these
stones
the
same
ceremonies
are
repeated
the
meaning
of
the
rite
is
evident
when
the
alatunja
strikes
the
sacred
stones
it
is
to
detach
some
dust
the
grains
of
this
very
holy
dust
are
regarded
as
so
many
germs
of
life
each
of
them
contains
a
spiritual
principle
which
will
give
birth
to
a
new
being
when
introduced
into
an
organism
of
the
same
species
the
branches
with
which
the
assistants
are
provided
serve
to
scatter
this
precious
dust
in
all
directions
it
is
scattered
everywhere
to
accomplish
its
fecundating
work
by
this
means
they
assure
in
their
own
minds
an
abundant
reproduction
of
the
animal
species
over
which
the
clans
guard
so
to
speak
and
upon
which
it
depends
the
natives
themselves
give
the
rite
this
interpretation
thus
in
the
clan
of
the
a
kind
of
manna
they
proceed
in
the
following
manner
when
the
day
of
the
intichiuma
arrives
the
group
assembles
near
a
huge
rock
about
fifty
feet
high
on
top
of
this
rock
is
another
very
similar
to
the
first
in
aspect
and
surrounded
by
other
smaller
ones
both
represent
masses
of
manna
the
alatunja
digs
up
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
this
rock
and
uncovers
a
churinga
which
is
believed
to
have
been
buried
there
in
alcheringa
times
and
which
is
as
it
were
the
quintessence
of
the
manna
then
he
climbs
up
to
the
summit
of
the
higher
rock
and
rubs
it
first
with
the
churinga
and
then
with
the
smaller
stones
which
surround
it
finally
he
brushes
away
the
dust
which
has
thus
been
collected
on
the
surface
of
the
rock
with
the
branches
of
a
tree
each
of
the
assistants
does
the
same
in
his
turn
now
spencer
and
gillen
say
that
the
idea
of
the
natives
is
that
the
dust
thus
scattered
will
settle
upon
the
mulga
trees
and
so
produce
manna
in
fact
these
operations
are
accompanied
by
a
hymn
sung
by
those
present
in
which
this
idea
is
expressed
with
variations
this
same
rite
is
found
in
other
societies
among
the
urabunna
there
is
a
rock
representing
an
ancestor
of
the
lizard
clan
bits
are
detached
from
it
which
they
throw
in
every
direction
in
order
to
secure
an
abundant
production
of
lizards
in
this
same
tribe
there
is
a
which
mythological
souvenirs
closely
associate
with
the
louse
totem
at
the
same
spot
are
two
trees
one
of
which
is
called
the
ordinary
louse
tree
the
other
the
tree
they
take
some
of
this
sand
rub
it
on
these
trees
throw
it
about
on
every
side
and
become
convinced
that
as
a
result
of
this
lice
will
be
born
in
large
numbers
the
mara
perform
the
intichiuma
of
the
bees
by
scattering
dust
detached
from
sacred
rocks
for
the
kangaroo
of
the
plains
a
slightly
different
method
is
used
they
take
some
and
wrap
it
up
in
a
certain
herb
of
which
the
animal
is
very
fond
and
which
belongs
to
the
kangaroo
totem
for
this
reason
then
they
put
the
dung
thus
enveloped
on
the
ground
between
two
bunches
of
this
herb
and
set
the
whole
thing
on
fire
with
the
flame
thus
made
they
light
the
branches
of
trees
and
then
whirl
them
about
in
such
a
way
that
sparks
fly
in
every
direction
these
sparks
play
the
same
rôle
as
the
dust
in
the
preceding
cases
in
a
certain
number
of
clans
men
mix
something
of
their
own
substance
with
that
of
the
stone
in
order
to
make
the
rite
more
efficacious
young
men
open
their
veins
and
let
streams
of
blood
flow
on
to
the
rock
this
is
the
case
for
example
in
the
intichiuma
of
the
hakea
flower
among
the
arunta
the
ceremony
takes
place
in
a
sacred
place
around
an
equally
sacred
rock
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
natives
represents
hakea
flowers
after
certain
preliminary
operations
the
old
leader
asks
one
of
the
young
men
to
open
a
vein
in
his
arm
which
he
does
and
allows
the
blood
to
sprinkle
freely
while
the
other
men
continue
the
singing
the
blood
flows
until
the
stone
is
completely
covered
the
object
of
this
practice
is
to
revivify
the
virtues
of
the
stone
after
a
fashion
and
to
reinforce
its
efficacy
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
men
of
the
clan
are
relatives
of
the
plant
or
animal
whose
name
they
bear
the
same
principle
of
life
is
in
them
and
especially
in
their
blood
so
it
is
only
natural
that
one
should
use
this
blood
and
the
mystic
germs
which
it
carries
to
assure
the
regular
reproduction
of
the
totemic
species
it
frequently
happens
among
the
arunta
that
when
a
man
is
sick
or
tired
one
of
his
young
companions
opens
his
veins
and
sprinkles
him
with
his
blood
in
order
to
reanimate
him
if
blood
is
able
to
reawaken
life
in
a
man
in
this
way
it
is
not
surprising
that
it
should
also
be
able
to
awaken
it
in
the
animal
or
vegetable
species
with
which
the
men
of
the
clan
are
confounded
the
same
process
is
employed
in
the
intichiuma
of
the
undiara
kangaroo
among
the
arunta
the
theatre
of
the
ceremony
is
a
vaulted
over
by
a
peaked
rock
this
rock
represents
an
of
the
alcheringa
which
was
killed
and
deposited
there
by
a
of
the
same
epoch
many
kangaroo
spirits
are
also
believed
to
reside
there
after
a
certain
number
of
sacred
stones
have
been
rubbed
against
each
other
in
the
way
we
have
described
several
of
the
assistants
climb
up
on
the
rock
upon
which
they
let
their
blood
flow
the
purpose
of
the
ceremony
at
the
present
day
so
say
the
natives
is
by
means
of
pouring
out
the
blood
of
kangaroo
men
upon
the
rock
to
drive
out
in
all
directions
the
spirits
of
the
kangaroo
animals
and
so
to
increase
the
number
of
the
animals
there
is
even
one
case
among
the
arunta
where
the
blood
seems
to
be
the
active
principle
in
the
rite
in
the
emu
group
they
do
not
use
sacred
stones
or
anything
resembling
them
the
alatunja
and
some
of
his
assistants
sprinkle
the
ground
with
their
blood
on
the
ground
thus
soaked
they
trace
lines
in
various
colours
representing
the
different
parts
of
the
body
of
an
emu
they
kneel
down
around
this
design
and
chant
a
monotonous
hymn
from
the
fictitious
emu
to
which
this
chant
is
addressed
and
consequently
from
the
blood
which
has
served
to
make
it
they
believe
that
vivifying
principles
go
forth
which
animate
the
embryos
of
the
new
generation
and
thus
prevent
the
species
from
disappearing
among
the
wonkgongaru
there
is
one
clan
whose
totem
is
a
certain
kind
of
fish
in
the
intichiuma
of
this
totem
also
it
is
the
blood
that
plays
the
principal
part
the
chief
of
the
group
after
being
ceremoniously
painted
goes
into
a
pool
of
water
and
sits
down
there
then
he
pierces
his
scrotum
and
the
skin
around
his
navel
with
small
pointed
bones
the
blood
from
the
wounds
goes
into
the
water
and
gives
rise
to
fish
by
a
wholly
similar
process
the
dieri
think
that
they
assure
the
reproduction
of
two
of
their
totems
the
carpet
snake
and
the
woma
snake
the
ordinary
snake
a
named
minkani
is
thought
to
live
under
a
dune
his
body
is
represented
by
some
fossil
bones
of
animals
or
reptiles
such
as
the
deltas
of
the
rivers
flowing
into
lake
eyre
contain
according
to
howitt
when
the
day
of
the
ceremony
arrives
the
men
assemble
and
go
to
the
home
of
the
minkani
there
they
dig
until
they
come
to
a
layer
of
damp
earth
which
they
call
the
excrement
of
minkani
from
now
on
they
continue
to
turn
up
the
soil
with
great
care
until
they
uncover
the
elbow
of
minkani
then
two
young
men
open
their
veins
and
let
their
blood
flow
on
to
the
sacred
rock
they
chant
the
hymn
of
minkani
while
the
assistants
carried
away
in
a
veritable
frenzy
beat
each
other
with
their
arms
the
battle
continues
until
they
get
back
to
the
camp
which
is
about
a
mile
away
here
the
women
intervene
and
put
an
end
to
the
combat
they
collect
the
blood
which
has
flown
from
the
wounds
mix
it
with
the
excrement
of
minkani
and
scatter
the
resulting
mixture
over
the
dune
when
this
rite
has
been
accomplished
they
are
convinced
that
carpet
snakes
will
be
born
in
abundance
in
certain
cases
they
use
the
very
substance
which
they
wish
to
produce
as
the
vivifying
principle
thus
among
the
kaitish
in
the
course
of
a
ceremony
whose
object
is
to
create
rain
they
sprinkle
water
over
a
sacred
rock
which
represents
the
mythical
heroes
of
the
water
clan
it
is
evident
that
they
believe
that
by
this
means
they
augment
the
productive
virtues
of
the
rock
just
as
well
as
with
blood
and
for
the
same
reasons
among
the
mara
the
actor
takes
water
from
a
sacred
hole
puts
it
in
his
mouth
and
spits
it
out
in
every
direction
among
the
worgaia
when
the
yams
begin
to
sprout
the
chief
of
the
yam
clan
sends
men
of
the
phratry
of
which
he
is
not
a
member
himself
to
gather
some
of
these
plants
these
bring
some
to
him
and
ask
him
to
intervene
in
order
that
the
species
may
develop
well
he
takes
one
chews
it
and
throws
the
bits
in
every
direction
among
the
kaitish
when
after
various
rites
which
we
shall
not
describe
the
grain
of
a
certain
grass
called
erlipinna
has
reached
its
full
development
the
chief
of
the
totem
brings
a
little
of
it
to
camp
and
grinds
it
between
two
stones
the
dust
thus
obtained
is
piously
gathered
up
and
a
few
grains
are
placed
on
the
lips
of
the
chief
who
scatters
them
by
blowing
this
contact
with
the
mouth
of
the
chief
which
has
a
very
special
sacramental
virtue
undoubtedly
has
the
object
of
stimulating
the
vitality
of
the
germs
which
these
grains
contain
and
which
being
blown
to
all
the
quarters
of
the
horizon
go
to
communicate
these
fecundating
virtues
which
they
possess
to
the
plants
the
efficacy
of
these
rites
is
never
doubted
by
the
native
he
is
convinced
that
they
must
produce
the
results
he
expects
with
a
sort
of
necessity
if
events
deceive
his
hopes
he
merely
concludes
that
they
were
counteracted
by
the
sorcery
of
some
hostile
group
in
any
case
it
never
enters
his
mind
that
a
favourable
result
could
be
obtained
by
any
other
means
if
by
chance
the
vegetation
grows
or
the
animals
produce
before
he
has
performed
his
intichiuma
he
supposes
that
another
intichiuma
has
been
celebrated
under
the
ground
by
the
ancestors
and
that
the
living
reap
the
benefits
of
this
subterranean
ceremony
ii
this
is
the
first
act
of
the
celebration
during
the
period
immediately
following
there
are
no
regular
ceremonies
however
the
religious
life
remains
intense
this
is
manifested
especially
by
an
aggravation
of
the
system
of
interdicts
it
is
as
though
the
sacred
character
of
the
totem
were
reinforced
they
do
not
even
dare
to
touch
it
in
ordinary
times
the
arunta
may
eat
the
animal
or
plant
which
serves
as
totem
provided
they
do
so
with
moderation
but
on
the
morrow
of
the
intichiuma
this
right
is
suspended
the
alimentary
interdiction
is
strict
and
without
exceptions
they
believe
that
any
violation
of
this
interdict
would
result
in
neutralizing
the
good
effects
of
the
rite
and
in
preventing
the
increase
of
the
species
it
is
true
that
the
men
of
other
totems
who
happen
to
be
in
the
same
locality
are
not
submitted
to
the
same
prohibition
however
their
liberty
is
less
than
ordinary
at
this
time
they
may
not
consume
the
totemic
animal
wherever
they
place
in
the
brush
for
example
they
must
bring
it
to
camp
and
it
is
there
only
that
it
may
be
cooked
a
final
ceremony
terminates
this
period
of
extraordinary
interdictions
and
definitely
closes
this
long
series
of
rites
it
varies
somewhat
in
different
clans
but
the
essential
elements
are
the
same
everywhere
here
are
the
two
principal
forms
which
it
takes
among
the
arunta
one
of
these
is
in
connection
with
the
witchetty
grub
the
other
with
the
kangaroo
when
the
grubs
have
attained
full
maturity
and
appear
in
abundance
the
men
of
the
totem
as
well
as
others
collect
as
many
of
them
as
possible
then
they
all
bring
those
they
have
found
back
to
camp
and
cook
them
until
they
become
hard
and
brittle
they
are
then
preserved
in
wooden
vessels
called
the
harvest
of
grubs
is
possible
only
during
a
very
short
time
for
they
appear
only
after
the
rain
when
they
begin
to
be
less
numerous
the
alatunja
summons
everybody
to
the
camp
on
his
invitation
each
one
brings
his
supply
the
others
place
theirs
before
the
men
of
that
totem
the
alatunja
takes
one
of
these
and
with
the
aid
of
his
companions
he
grinds
its
contents
between
two
stones
after
this
he
eats
a
little
of
the
powder
thus
obtained
his
assistants
do
the
same
and
what
remains
is
given
to
the
men
of
the
other
clans
who
may
now
dispose
of
it
freely
they
proceed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
with
the
supply
provided
by
the
alatunja
from
now
on
the
men
and
women
of
the
totem
may
eat
it
but
only
a
little
at
a
time
if
they
went
beyond
the
limits
allowed
they
would
lose
the
powers
necessary
to
celebrate
the
intichiuma
and
the
species
would
not
reproduce
yet
if
they
did
not
eat
any
at
all
and
especially
if
the
alatunja
ate
none
in
the
circumstances
we
have
just
described
they
would
be
overtaken
by
the
same
incapacity
in
the
totemic
group
of
the
kangaroo
which
has
its
centre
at
undiara
certain
characteristics
of
the
ceremony
are
more
clearly
marked
after
the
rites
which
we
have
described
have
been
accomplished
on
the
sacred
rock
the
young
men
go
and
hunt
the
kangaroo
bringing
their
game
back
to
the
camp
here
the
old
men
with
the
alatunja
in
their
midst
eat
a
little
of
the
flesh
of
the
animal
and
anoint
the
bodies
of
those
who
took
part
in
the
intichiuma
with
its
fat
the
rest
is
divided
up
among
the
men
assembled
next
the
men
of
the
totem
decorate
themselves
with
totemic
designs
and
the
night
is
passed
in
songs
commemorating
the
exploits
accomplished
by
men
and
animal
kangaroos
in
the
times
of
the
alcheringa
the
next
day
the
young
men
go
hunting
again
in
the
forest
and
bring
back
a
larger
number
of
kangaroos
than
the
first
time
and
the
ceremonies
of
the
day
before
recommence
with
variations
of
detail
the
same
rite
is
found
in
other
arunta
clans
among
the
urabunna
the
kaitish
the
unmatjera
and
in
the
encounter
bay
tribe
everywhere
it
is
made
up
of
the
same
essential
elements
a
few
specimens
of
the
totemic
animal
or
plant
are
presented
to
the
chief
of
the
clan
who
solemnly
eats
them
and
who
must
eat
them
if
he
did
not
fulfil
this
duty
he
would
lose
the
power
of
celebrating
the
intichiuma
efficaciously
that
is
to
say
so
as
to
recreate
the
species
annually
sometimes
the
ritual
consumption
is
followed
by
an
unction
made
with
the
fat
of
the
animal
or
certain
parts
of
the
plant
this
rite
is
generally
repeated
by
the
men
of
the
totem
or
at
least
by
the
old
men
and
after
it
has
been
accomplished
the
exceptional
interdictions
are
raised
in
the
tribes
located
farther
north
among
the
warramunga
and
neighbouring
societies
this
ceremony
is
no
longer
found
however
traces
are
found
which
seem
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
known
it
is
true
that
the
chief
of
the
clan
never
eats
the
totem
ritually
and
obligatorily
but
in
certain
cases
men
who
are
not
of
the
totem
whose
intichiuma
has
just
been
celebrated
must
bring
the
animal
or
plant
to
camp
and
offer
it
to
the
chief
asking
him
if
he
wants
to
eat
it
he
refuses
and
adds
i
have
made
this
for
you
you
may
eat
it
freely
so
the
custom
of
the
presentation
remains
and
the
question
asked
of
the
chief
seems
to
date
back
to
an
epoch
when
the
ritual
consumption
was
practised
iii
the
interest
of
the
system
of
rites
which
has
just
been
described
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
them
we
find
in
the
most
elementary
form
that
is
actually
known
all
the
essential
principles
of
a
great
religious
institution
which
was
destined
to
become
one
of
the
foundation
stones
of
the
positive
cult
in
the
superior
religions
this
is
the
institution
of
sacrifice
we
know
what
a
revolution
the
work
of
robertson
smith
brought
about
in
the
traditional
theory
of
sacrifice
before
him
sacrifice
was
regarded
as
a
sort
of
tribute
or
homage
either
obligatory
or
optional
analogous
to
that
which
subjects
owe
to
their
princes
robertson
smith
was
the
first
to
remark
that
this
classic
explanation
did
not
account
for
two
essential
characteristics
of
the
rite
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
repast
its
substance
is
food
secondly
it
is
a
repast
in
which
the
worshippers
who
offer
it
take
part
along
with
the
god
to
whom
it
is
offered
certain
parts
of
the
victim
are
reserved
for
the
divinity
others
are
attributed
to
the
sacrificers
who
consume
them
this
is
why
the
bible
often
speaks
of
the
sacrifice
as
a
repast
in
the
presence
of
jahveh
now
in
a
multitude
of
societies
meals
taken
in
common
are
believed
to
create
a
bond
of
artificial
kinship
between
those
who
assist
at
them
in
fact
relatives
are
people
who
are
naturally
made
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
but
food
is
constantly
remaking
the
substance
of
the
organism
so
a
common
food
may
produce
the
same
effects
as
a
common
origin
according
to
smith
sacrificial
banquets
have
the
object
of
making
the
worshipper
and
his
god
communicate
in
the
same
flesh
in
order
to
form
a
bond
of
kinship
between
them
from
this
point
of
view
sacrifice
takes
on
a
wholly
new
aspect
its
essential
element
is
no
longer
the
act
of
renouncement
which
the
word
sacrifice
ordinarily
expresses
before
all
it
is
an
act
of
alimentary
communion
of
course
there
are
some
reservations
to
be
made
in
the
details
of
this
way
of
explaining
the
efficacy
of
sacrificial
banquets
this
does
not
result
exclusively
from
the
act
of
eating
together
a
man
does
not
sanctify
himself
merely
by
sitting
down
in
some
way
at
the
same
table
with
a
god
but
especially
by
eating
food
at
this
ritual
repast
which
has
a
sacred
character
it
has
been
shown
how
a
whole
series
of
preliminary
operations
lustrations
unctions
prayers
transform
the
animal
to
be
immolated
into
a
sacred
thing
whose
sacredness
is
subsequently
transferred
to
the
worshipper
who
eats
it
but
it
is
true
none
the
less
that
the
alimentary
communion
is
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
the
sacrifice
now
when
we
turn
to
the
rite
which
terminates
the
ceremonies
of
the
intichiuma
we
find
that
it
too
consists
in
an
act
of
this
sort
after
the
totemic
animal
has
been
killed
the
alatunja
and
the
old
men
solemnly
eat
it
so
they
communicate
with
the
sacred
principle
residing
in
it
and
they
assimilate
it
the
only
difference
we
find
here
is
that
the
animal
is
naturally
sacred
while
it
ordinarily
acquires
this
character
artificially
in
the
course
of
the
sacrifice
moreover
the
object
of
this
communion
is
manifest
every
member
of
a
totemic
clan
contains
a
mystic
substance
within
him
which
is
the
part
of
his
being
for
his
soul
is
made
out
of
it
from
it
come
whatever
powers
he
has
and
his
social
position
for
it
is
this
which
makes
him
a
person
so
he
has
a
vital
interest
in
maintaining
it
intact
and
in
keeping
it
as
far
as
is
possible
in
a
state
of
perpetual
youth
unfortunately
all
forces
even
the
most
spiritual
are
used
up
in
the
course
of
time
if
nothing
comes
to
return
to
them
the
energy
they
lose
through
the
normal
working
of
things
there
is
a
necessity
of
the
first
importance
here
which
as
we
shall
see
is
the
real
reason
for
the
positive
cult
therefore
the
men
of
a
totem
can
not
retain
their
position
unless
they
periodically
revivify
the
totemic
principle
which
is
in
them
and
as
they
represent
this
principle
in
the
form
of
a
vegetable
or
animal
it
is
to
the
corresponding
animal
or
vegetable
species
that
they
go
to
demand
the
supplementary
forces
needed
to
renew
this
and
to
rejuvenate
it
a
man
of
the
kangaroo
clan
believes
himself
and
feels
himself
a
kangaroo
it
is
by
this
quality
that
he
defines
himself
it
is
this
which
marks
his
place
in
the
society
in
order
to
keep
it
he
takes
a
little
of
the
flesh
of
this
same
animal
into
his
own
body
from
time
to
time
a
small
bit
is
enough
owing
to
the
rule
part
is
equal
to
the
if
this
operation
is
to
produce
all
the
desired
effects
it
may
not
take
place
at
no
matter
what
moment
the
most
opportune
time
is
when
the
new
generation
has
just
reached
its
complete
development
for
this
is
also
the
moment
when
the
forces
animating
the
totemic
species
attain
their
maximum
intensity
they
have
just
been
drawn
with
great
difficulty
from
those
rich
reservoirs
of
life
the
sacred
trees
and
rocks
moreover
all
sorts
of
means
have
been
employed
to
increase
their
intensity
still
more
this
is
the
use
of
the
rites
performed
during
the
first
part
of
the
intichiuma
also
by
their
very
aspect
the
firstfruits
of
the
harvest
manifest
the
energy
which
they
contain
here
the
totemic
god
acclaims
himself
in
all
the
glory
of
his
youth
this
is
why
the
firstfruits
have
always
been
regarded
as
a
very
sacred
fruit
reserved
for
very
holy
beings
so
it
is
natural
that
the
australian
uses
it
to
regenerate
himself
spiritually
thus
both
the
date
and
the
circumstances
of
the
ceremonies
are
explained
perhaps
some
will
be
surprised
that
so
sacred
a
food
may
be
eaten
by
ordinary
profane
persons
but
in
the
first
place
there
is
no
positive
cult
which
does
not
face
this
contradiction
every
sacred
being
is
removed
from
profane
touch
by
this
very
character
with
which
it
is
endowed
but
on
the
other
hand
they
would
serve
for
nothing
and
have
no
reason
whatsoever
for
their
existence
if
they
could
not
come
in
contact
with
these
same
worshippers
who
on
another
ground
must
remain
respectfully
distant
from
them
at
bottom
there
is
no
positive
rite
which
does
not
constitute
a
veritable
sacrilege
for
a
man
can
not
hold
commerce
with
the
sacred
beings
without
crossing
the
barrier
which
should
ordinarily
keep
them
separate
but
the
important
thing
is
that
the
sacrilege
should
be
accompanied
with
precautions
which
attenuate
it
among
those
employed
the
most
usual
one
consists
in
arranging
the
transition
so
as
to
introduce
the
worshipper
slowly
and
gradually
into
the
circle
of
sacred
things
when
it
has
been
broken
and
diluted
in
this
fashion
the
sacrilege
does
not
offend
the
religious
conscience
so
violently
it
is
not
regarded
as
a
sacrilege
and
so
vanishes
this
is
what
happens
in
the
case
now
before
us
the
effect
of
the
whole
series
of
rites
which
has
preceded
the
moment
when
the
totem
is
solemnly
eaten
has
been
to
sanctify
those
who
took
an
active
part
in
them
they
constitute
an
essentially
religious
period
through
which
no
one
could
go
without
a
transformation
of
his
religious
state
the
fasts
the
contact
with
sacred
rocks
the
churinga
the
totemic
decorations
have
gradually
conferred
upon
him
a
character
which
he
did
not
have
before
and
which
enables
him
to
approach
without
a
shocking
and
dangerous
profanation
this
desirable
and
redoubtable
food
which
is
forbidden
him
in
ordinary
times
if
the
act
by
which
a
sacred
being
is
first
immolated
and
then
eaten
by
those
who
adore
it
may
be
called
a
sacrifice
the
rite
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
has
a
right
to
this
same
name
moreover
its
significance
is
well
shown
by
the
striking
analogies
it
presents
with
so
many
practices
met
with
in
a
large
number
of
agrarian
cults
it
is
a
very
general
rule
that
even
among
peoples
who
have
attained
a
high
degree
of
civilization
the
firstfruits
of
the
harvest
are
used
in
the
ritual
repasts
of
which
the
pascal
feast
is
the
best
known
example
on
the
other
hand
as
the
agrarian
rites
are
at
the
very
basis
of
the
most
advanced
forms
of
the
cult
we
see
that
the
intichiuma
of
the
australian
societies
is
closer
to
us
than
one
might
imagine
from
its
apparent
crudeness
by
an
intuition
of
genius
smith
had
an
intuition
of
all
this
though
he
was
not
acquainted
with
the
facts
by
a
series
of
ingenious
deductions
which
need
not
be
reproduced
here
for
their
interest
is
now
only
historical
he
thought
that
he
could
establish
the
fact
that
at
the
beginning
the
animal
immolated
in
the
sacrifice
must
have
been
regarded
as
and
as
a
close
relative
of
those
who
immolated
it
now
these
characteristics
are
just
the
ones
with
which
the
totemic
species
is
defined
smith
even
went
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
totemism
must
have
known
and
practised
a
rite
wholly
similar
to
the
one
we
have
been
studying
he
was
even
inclined
to
see
the
original
source
of
the
whole
sacrificial
institution
in
a
sacrifice
of
this
sort
sacrifice
was
not
founded
to
create
a
bond
of
artificial
kinship
between
a
man
and
his
gods
but
to
maintain
and
renew
the
natural
kinship
which
primitively
united
them
here
as
elsewhere
the
artifice
was
born
only
to
imitate
nature
but
in
the
book
of
smith
this
hypothesis
was
presented
as
scarcely
more
than
a
theory
which
the
then
known
facts
supported
very
imperfectly
the
rare
cases
of
totemic
sacrifice
which
he
cites
in
support
of
his
theory
do
not
have
the
significance
he
attributed
to
them
the
animals
which
figure
in
them
are
not
real
totems
but
we
are
able
to
state
that
on
at
least
one
point
the
demonstration
is
made
in
fact
we
have
just
seen
that
in
an
important
number
of
societies
the
totemic
sacrifice
such
as
smith
conceived
it
is
or
has
been
practised
of
course
we
have
no
proof
that
this
practice
is
necessarily
inherent
to
totemism
or
that
it
is
the
germ
out
of
which
all
the
other
types
of
sacrifices
have
developed
but
if
the
universality
of
the
rite
is
hypothetical
its
existence
is
no
longer
to
be
contested
hereafter
it
is
to
be
regarded
as
established
that
the
most
mystical
form
of
the
alimentary
communion
is
found
even
in
the
most
rudimentary
cults
known
iv
but
on
another
point
the
new
facts
at
our
disposal
invalidate
the
theories
of
smith
according
to
him
the
communion
was
not
only
an
essential
element
of
the
sacrifice
but
at
the
beginning
at
least
it
was
the
unique
element
not
only
is
one
mistaken
when
he
reduces
sacrifice
to
nothing
more
than
a
tribute
or
offering
but
the
very
idea
of
an
offering
was
originally
absent
from
it
this
intervened
only
at
a
late
period
and
under
the
influence
of
external
circumstances
so
instead
of
being
able
to
aid
us
in
understanding
it
it
has
rather
masked
the
real
nature
of
the
ritual
mechanism
in
fact
smith
claimed
to
find
in
the
very
notion
of
oblation
an
absurdity
so
revolting
that
it
could
never
have
been
the
fundamental
reason
for
so
great
an
institution
one
of
the
most
important
functions
incumbent
upon
the
divinity
is
to
assure
to
men
that
food
which
is
necessary
for
life
so
it
seems
impossible
that
the
sacrifice
in
its
turn
should
consist
in
a
presentation
of
food
to
the
divinity
it
even
seems
that
the
gods
should
expect
their
food
from
a
man
when
it
is
from
them
that
he
gets
his
why
should
they
have
need
of
his
aid
in
order
to
deduct
beforehand
their
just
share
of
the
things
which
he
receives
from
their
hands
from
these
considerations
smith
concluded
that
the
idea
of
a
could
have
been
born
only
in
the
great
religions
where
the
gods
removed
from
the
things
with
which
they
were
primitively
confused
were
thought
of
as
sorts
of
kings
and
the
eminent
proprietors
of
the
earth
and
its
products
from
this
moment
onwards
the
sacrifice
was
associated
with
the
tribute
which
subjects
paid
to
their
prince
as
a
price
of
the
rights
which
were
conceded
to
them
but
this
new
interpretation
was
really
an
alteration
and
even
a
corruption
of
the
primitive
conception
for
the
idea
of
property
materializes
all
that
it
touches
by
introducing
itself
into
the
sacrifice
it
denatured
it
and
made
it
into
a
sort
of
bargain
between
the
man
and
the
divinity
but
the
facts
which
we
have
described
overthrow
this
argumentation
these
rites
are
certainly
among
the
most
primitive
that
have
ever
been
observed
no
determined
mythical
personality
appears
in
them
there
is
no
question
of
gods
or
spirits
that
are
properly
so
called
it
is
only
vaguely
anonymous
and
impersonal
forces
which
they
put
into
action
yet
the
reasoning
which
they
suppose
is
exactly
the
one
that
smith
declared
impossible
because
of
its
absurdity
let
us
return
to
the
first
act
of
the
intichiuma
to
the
rites
destined
to
assure
the
fecundity
of
the
animal
or
vegetable
species
which
serves
the
clan
as
totem
this
species
is
the
sacred
thing
in
it
is
incarnated
that
which
we
have
been
able
to
call
by
metaphor
the
totemic
divinity
yet
we
have
seen
that
to
perpetuate
itself
it
has
need
of
the
aid
of
men
it
is
they
who
dispense
the
life
of
the
new
generation
each
year
without
them
it
would
never
be
born
if
they
stopped
celebrating
the
intichiuma
the
sacred
beings
would
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
so
in
one
sense
it
is
from
men
that
they
get
their
existence
yet
in
another
way
it
is
from
them
that
men
get
theirs
for
after
they
have
once
arrived
at
maturity
it
is
from
them
that
men
acquire
the
force
needed
to
support
and
repair
their
spiritual
beings
thus
we
are
able
to
say
that
men
make
their
gods
or
at
least
make
them
live
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
from
them
that
they
live
themselves
so
they
are
regularly
guilty
of
the
circle
which
according
to
smith
is
implied
in
the
very
idea
of
a
sacrificial
tribute
they
give
to
the
sacred
beings
a
little
of
what
they
receive
from
them
and
they
receive
from
them
all
that
they
give
but
there
is
still
more
to
be
said
the
oblations
which
he
is
thus
forced
to
make
every
year
do
not
differ
in
nature
from
those
which
are
made
later
in
the
rites
properly
called
sacrifices
if
the
sacrificer
immolates
an
animal
it
is
in
order
that
the
living
principles
within
it
may
be
disengaged
from
the
organism
and
go
to
nourish
the
divinity
likewise
the
grains
of
dust
which
the
australian
detaches
from
the
sacred
rock
are
so
many
sacred
principles
which
he
scatters
into
space
so
that
they
may
go
to
animate
the
totemic
species
and
assure
its
renewal
the
gesture
with
which
this
scattering
is
made
is
also
that
which
normally
accompanies
offerings
in
certain
cases
the
resemblance
between
the
two
rites
may
be
followed
even
to
the
details
of
the
movements
effected
we
have
seen
that
in
order
to
have
rain
the
kaitish
pour
water
over
the
sacred
stone
among
certain
peoples
the
priest
pours
water
over
the
altar
with
the
same
end
in
view
the
effusions
of
blood
which
are
usual
in
a
certain
number
of
intichiuma
are
veritable
oblations
just
as
the
arunta
or
dieri
sprinkle
the
sacred
rock
or
the
totemic
design
with
blood
so
it
frequently
happens
that
in
the
more
advanced
cults
the
blood
of
the
sacrificed
victim
or
of
the
worshipper
himself
is
spilt
before
or
upon
the
altar
in
these
cases
it
is
given
to
the
gods
of
whom
it
is
the
preferred
food
in
australia
it
is
given
to
the
sacred
species
so
we
have
no
ground
for
saying
that
the
idea
of
oblation
is
a
late
product
of
civilization
a
document
which
we
owe
to
strehlow
puts
this
kinship
of
the
intichiuma
and
the
sacrifice
clearly
into
evidence
this
is
a
hymn
which
accompanies
the
intichiuma
of
the
kangaroo
the
ceremony
is
described
at
the
same
time
that
its
expected
effects
are
announced
a
morsel
of
kangaroo
fat
has
been
placed
by
the
chief
upon
a
support
made
of
branches
the
text
says
that
this
fat
makes
the
fat
of
the
kangaroos
increase
this
time
they
do
not
confine
themselves
to
sprinkling
sacred
dust
or
human
blood
about
the
animal
itself
is
immolated
or
sacrificed
as
one
might
say
placed
upon
a
sort
of
altar
and
offered
to
the
species
whose
life
it
should
maintain
now
we
see
the
sense
in
which
we
may
say
that
the
intichiuma
contains
the
germs
of
the
sacrificial
system
in
the
form
which
it
takes
when
fully
constituted
a
sacrifice
is
composed
of
two
essential
elements
an
act
of
communion
and
an
act
of
oblation
the
worshipper
communes
with
his
god
by
taking
in
a
sacred
food
and
at
the
same
time
he
makes
an
offering
to
this
god
we
find
these
two
acts
in
the
intichiuma
as
we
have
described
it
the
only
difference
is
that
in
the
ordinary
sacrifice
they
are
made
simultaneously
or
else
follow
one
another
immediately
while
in
the
australian
ceremony
they
are
separated
in
the
former
case
they
are
parts
of
one
undivided
rite
here
they
take
place
at
different
times
and
may
even
be
separated
by
a
rather
long
interval
but
at
bottom
the
mechanism
is
the
same
taken
as
a
whole
the
intichiuma
is
a
sacrifice
but
one
whose
parts
are
not
yet
articulated
and
organized
the
relating
of
these
two
ceremonies
has
the
double
advantage
of
enabling
us
to
understand
better
the
nature
of
the
intichiuma
and
that
of
sacrifice
we
understand
the
intichiuma
better
in
fact
the
conception
of
frazer
which
made
it
a
simple
magic
operation
with
no
religious
character
at
all
is
now
seen
to
be
unsupportable
one
can
not
dream
of
excluding
from
religion
a
rite
which
is
the
forerunner
of
so
great
a
religious
institution
but
we
also
understand
what
the
sacrifice
itself
is
better
in
the
first
place
the
equal
importance
of
the
two
elements
entering
into
it
is
now
established
if
the
australian
makes
offerings
to
his
sacred
beings
there
is
no
reason
for
supposing
that
the
idea
of
oblation
was
foreign
to
the
primitive
organization
of
the
sacrificial
institution
and
later
upset
its
natural
arrangement
the
theory
of
smith
must
be
revised
on
this
point
of
course
the
sacrifice
is
partially
a
communion
but
it
is
also
and
no
less
essentially
a
gift
and
an
act
of
renouncement
it
always
presupposes
that
the
worshipper
gives
some
of
his
substance
or
his
goods
to
his
gods
every
attempt
to
deduce
one
of
these
elements
from
the
other
is
hopeless
perhaps
the
oblation
is
even
more
permanent
than
the
communion
in
the
second
place
it
ordinarily
seems
as
though
the
sacrifice
and
especially
the
sacrificial
oblation
could
only
be
addressed
to
personal
beings
but
the
oblations
which
we
have
met
with
in
australia
imply
no
notion
of
this
sort
in
other
words
the
sacrifice
is
independent
of
the
varying
forms
in
which
the
religious
forces
are
conceived
it
is
founded
upon
more
profound
reasons
which
we
shall
seek
presently
in
any
case
it
is
clear
that
the
act
of
offering
naturally
arouses
in
the
mind
the
idea
of
a
moral
subject
whom
this
offering
is
destined
to
please
the
ritual
acts
which
we
have
described
become
more
intelligible
when
it
is
believed
that
they
are
addressed
to
persons
so
the
practices
of
the
intichiuma
while
actually
putting
only
impersonal
forces
into
play
prepare
the
way
for
a
different
conception
of
course
they
were
not
sufficient
to
form
the
idea
of
mythical
personalities
by
themselves
but
when
this
idea
had
once
been
formed
the
very
nature
of
these
rites
made
it
enter
into
the
cult
thus
taking
a
more
direct
interest
in
action
and
life
it
also
acquired
a
greater
reality
so
we
are
even
able
to
believe
that
the
cult
favoured
in
a
secondary
manner
no
doubt
but
nevertheless
one
which
is
worthy
of
attention
the
personification
of
the
religious
forces
v
but
we
still
have
to
explain
the
contradiction
in
which
robertson
smith
saw
an
inadmissible
logical
scandal
if
the
sacred
beings
always
manifested
their
powers
in
a
perfectly
equal
manner
it
would
appear
inconceivable
that
men
should
dream
of
offering
them
services
for
we
can
not
see
what
need
they
could
have
of
them
but
in
the
first
place
in
so
far
as
they
are
confused
with
things
and
in
so
far
as
they
are
regarded
as
principles
of
the
cosmic
life
they
are
themselves
submitted
to
the
rhythm
of
this
life
now
this
goes
in
oscillations
in
contrary
directions
which
succeed
one
another
according
to
a
determined
law
sometimes
it
is
affirmed
in
all
its
glory
sometimes
it
weakens
to
such
an
extent
that
one
may
ask
himself
whether
it
is
not
going
to
fade
away
vegetation
dies
every
year
will
it
be
reborn
animal
species
tend
to
become
extinguished
by
the
effect
of
natural
and
violent
death
will
they
be
renewed
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
way
as
is
proper
above
all
the
rain
is
capricious
there
are
long
periods
during
which
it
seems
to
have
disappeared
for
ever
these
periodical
variations
of
nature
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
at
the
corresponding
periods
the
sacred
beings
upon
whom
the
plants
animals
rain
depend
are
themselves
passing
through
grave
crises
so
they
too
have
their
periods
of
giving
way
but
men
could
not
regard
these
spectacles
as
indifferent
spectators
if
he
is
to
live
the
universal
life
must
continue
and
consequently
the
gods
must
not
die
so
he
seeks
to
sustain
and
aid
them
for
this
he
puts
at
their
service
whatever
forces
he
has
at
his
disposition
and
mobilizes
them
for
this
purpose
the
blood
flowing
in
his
veins
has
fecundating
virtues
he
pours
it
forth
from
the
sacred
rocks
possessed
by
his
clan
he
takes
those
germs
of
life
which
lie
dormant
there
and
scatters
them
into
space
in
a
word
he
makes
oblations
the
external
and
physical
crises
moreover
duplicate
internal
and
mental
crises
which
tend
toward
the
same
result
sacred
beings
exist
only
when
they
are
represented
as
such
in
the
mind
when
we
cease
to
believe
in
them
it
is
as
though
they
did
not
exist
even
those
which
have
a
material
form
and
are
given
by
sensible
experience
depend
upon
the
thought
of
the
worshippers
who
adore
them
for
the
sacred
character
which
makes
them
objects
of
the
cult
is
not
given
by
their
natural
constitution
it
is
added
to
them
by
belief
the
kangaroo
is
only
an
animal
like
all
others
yet
for
the
men
of
the
kangaroo
it
contains
within
it
a
principle
which
puts
it
outside
the
company
of
others
and
this
principle
exists
only
in
the
minds
of
those
who
believe
in
it
if
these
sacred
beings
when
once
conceived
are
to
have
no
need
of
men
to
continue
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
representations
expressing
them
always
remain
the
same
but
this
stability
is
impossible
in
fact
it
is
in
the
communal
life
that
they
are
formed
and
this
communal
life
is
essentially
intermittent
so
they
necessarily
partake
of
this
same
intermittency
they
attain
their
greatest
intensity
at
the
moment
when
the
men
are
assembled
together
and
are
in
immediate
relations
with
one
another
when
they
all
partake
of
the
same
idea
and
the
same
sentiment
but
when
the
assembly
has
broken
up
and
each
man
has
returned
to
his
own
peculiar
life
they
progressively
lose
their
original
energy
being
covered
over
little
by
little
by
the
rising
flood
of
daily
experiences
they
would
soon
fall
into
the
unconscious
if
we
did
not
find
some
means
of
calling
them
back
into
consciousness
and
revivifying
them
if
we
think
of
them
less
forcefully
they
amount
to
less
for
us
and
we
count
less
upon
them
they
exist
to
a
lesser
degree
so
here
we
have
another
point
of
view
from
which
the
services
of
men
are
necessary
to
them
this
second
reason
for
their
existence
is
even
more
important
than
the
first
for
it
exists
all
the
time
the
intermittency
of
the
physical
life
can
affect
religious
beliefs
only
when
religions
are
not
yet
detached
from
their
cosmic
basis
the
intermittency
of
the
social
life
on
the
other
hand
is
inevitable
even
the
most
idealistic
religions
can
not
escape
it
moreover
it
is
owing
to
this
state
of
dependency
upon
the
thought
of
men
in
which
the
gods
find
themselves
that
the
former
are
able
to
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
their
assistance
the
only
way
of
renewing
the
collective
representations
which
relate
to
sacred
beings
is
to
retemper
them
in
the
very
source
of
the
religious
life
that
is
to
say
in
the
assembled
groups
now
the
emotions
aroused
by
these
periodical
crises
through
which
external
things
pass
induce
the
men
who
witness
them
to
assemble
to
see
what
should
be
done
about
it
but
by
the
very
fact
of
uniting
they
are
mutually
comforted
they
find
a
remedy
because
they
seek
it
together
the
common
faith
becomes
reanimated
quite
naturally
in
the
heart
of
this
reconstituted
group
if
is
born
again
because
it
again
finds
those
very
conditions
in
which
it
was
born
in
the
first
place
after
it
has
been
restored
it
easily
triumphs
over
all
the
private
doubts
which
may
have
arisen
in
individual
minds
the
image
of
the
sacred
things
regains
power
enough
to
resist
the
internal
or
external
causes
which
tended
to
weaken
it
in
spite
of
their
apparent
failure
men
can
no
longer
believe
that
the
gods
will
die
because
they
feel
them
living
in
their
own
hearts
the
means
employed
to
succour
them
howsoever
crude
these
may
be
can
not
appear
vain
for
everything
goes
on
as
if
they
were
really
effective
men
are
more
confident
because
they
feel
themselves
stronger
and
they
really
are
stronger
because
forces
which
were
languishing
are
now
reawakened
in
the
consciousness
so
we
must
be
careful
not
to
believe
along
with
smith
that
the
cult
was
founded
solely
for
the
benefit
of
men
and
that
the
gods
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
they
have
no
less
need
of
it
than
their
worshippers
of
course
men
would
be
unable
to
live
without
gods
but
on
the
other
hand
the
gods
would
die
if
their
cult
were
not
rendered
this
does
not
have
the
sole
object
of
making
profane
subjects
communicate
with
sacred
beings
but
it
also
keeps
these
latter
alive
and
is
perpetually
remaking
and
regenerating
them
of
course
it
is
not
the
material
oblations
which
bring
about
this
regeneration
by
their
own
virtues
it
is
the
mental
states
which
these
actions
though
vain
in
themselves
accompany
or
reawaken
the
real
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
cults
even
of
those
which
are
the
most
materialistic
in
appearance
is
not
to
be
sought
in
the
acts
which
they
prescribe
but
in
the
internal
and
moral
regeneration
which
these
acts
aid
in
bringing
about
the
things
which
the
worshipper
really
gives
his
gods
are
not
the
foods
which
he
places
upon
the
altars
nor
the
blood
which
he
lets
flow
from
his
veins
it
is
his
thought
nevertheless
it
is
true
that
there
is
an
exchange
of
services
which
are
mutually
demanded
between
the
divinity
and
its
worshippers
the
rule
ut
by
which
the
principle
of
sacrifice
has
sometimes
been
defined
is
not
a
late
invention
of
utilitarian
theorists
it
only
expresses
in
an
explicit
way
the
very
mechanism
of
the
sacrificial
system
and
more
generally
of
the
whole
positive
cult
so
the
circle
pointed
out
by
smith
is
very
real
but
it
contains
nothing
humiliating
for
the
reason
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
sacred
beings
though
superior
to
men
can
live
only
in
the
human
consciousness
but
this
circle
will
appear
still
more
natural
to
us
and
we
shall
understand
its
meaning
and
the
reason
for
its
existence
still
better
if
carrying
our
analysis
still
farther
and
substituting
for
the
religious
symbols
the
realities
which
they
represent
we
investigate
how
these
behave
in
the
rite
if
as
we
have
attempted
to
establish
the
sacred
principle
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
society
transfigured
and
personified
it
should
be
possible
to
interpret
the
ritual
in
lay
and
social
terms
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
social
life
just
like
the
ritual
moves
in
a
circle
on
the
one
hand
the
individual
gets
from
society
the
best
part
of
himself
all
that
gives
him
a
distinct
character
and
a
special
place
among
other
beings
his
intellectual
and
moral
culture
if
we
should
withdraw
from
men
their
language
sciences
arts
and
moral
beliefs
they
would
drop
to
the
rank
of
animals
so
the
characteristic
attributes
of
human
nature
come
from
society
but
on
the
other
hand
society
exists
and
lives
only
in
and
through
individuals
if
the
idea
of
society
were
extinguished
in
individual
minds
and
the
beliefs
traditions
and
aspirations
of
the
group
were
no
longer
felt
and
shared
by
the
individuals
society
would
die
we
can
say
of
it
what
we
just
said
of
the
divinity
it
is
real
only
in
so
far
as
it
has
a
place
in
human
consciousnesses
and
this
place
is
whatever
one
we
may
give
it
we
now
see
the
real
reason
why
the
gods
can
not
do
without
their
worshippers
any
more
than
these
can
do
without
their
gods
it
is
because
society
of
which
the
gods
are
only
a
symbolic
expression
can
not
do
without
individuals
any
more
than
these
can
do
without
society
here
we
touch
the
solid
rock
upon
which
all
the
cults
are
built
and
which
has
caused
their
persistence
ever
since
human
societies
have
existed
when
we
see
what
religious
rites
consist
of
and
towards
what
they
seem
to
tend
we
demand
with
astonishment
how
men
have
been
able
to
imagine
them
and
especially
how
they
can
remain
so
faithfully
attached
to
them
whence
could
the
illusion
have
come
that
with
a
few
grains
of
sand
thrown
to
the
wind
or
a
few
drops
of
blood
shed
upon
a
rock
or
the
stone
of
an
altar
it
is
possible
to
maintain
the
life
of
an
animal
species
or
of
a
god
we
have
undoubtedly
made
a
step
in
advance
towards
the
solution
of
this
problem
when
we
have
discovered
behind
these
outward
and
apparently
unreasonable
movements
a
mental
mechanism
which
gives
them
a
meaning
and
a
moral
significance
but
we
are
in
no
way
assured
that
this
mechanism
itself
does
not
consist
in
a
simple
play
of
hallucinatory
images
we
have
pointed
out
the
psychological
process
which
leads
the
believers
to
imagine
that
the
rite
causes
the
spiritual
forces
of
which
they
have
need
to
be
reborn
about
them
but
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
that
this
belief
is
psychologically
explicable
that
it
has
any
objective
value
if
we
are
to
see
in
the
efficacy
attributed
to
the
rites
anything
more
than
the
product
of
a
chronic
delirium
with
which
humanity
has
abused
itself
we
must
show
that
the
effect
of
the
cult
really
is
to
recreate
periodically
a
moral
being
upon
which
we
depend
as
it
depends
upon
us
now
this
being
does
exist
it
is
society
howsoever
little
importance
the
religious
ceremonies
may
have
they
put
the
group
into
action
the
groups
assemble
to
celebrate
them
so
their
first
effect
is
to
bring
individuals
together
to
multiply
the
relations
between
them
and
to
make
them
more
intimate
with
one
another
by
this
very
fact
the
contents
of
their
consciousnesses
is
changed
on
ordinary
days
it
is
utilitarian
and
individual
avocations
which
take
the
greater
part
of
the
attention
every
one
attends
to
his
own
personal
business
for
most
men
this
primarily
consists
in
satisfying
the
exigencies
of
material
life
and
the
principal
incentive
to
economic
activity
has
always
been
private
interest
of
course
social
sentiments
could
never
be
totally
absent
we
remain
in
relations
with
others
the
habits
ideas
and
tendencies
which
education
has
impressed
upon
us
and
which
ordinarily
preside
over
our
relations
with
others
continue
to
make
their
action
felt
but
they
are
constantly
combated
and
held
in
check
by
the
antagonistic
tendencies
aroused
and
supported
by
the
necessities
of
the
daily
struggle
they
resist
more
or
less
successfully
according
to
their
intrinsic
energy
but
this
energy
is
not
renewed
they
live
upon
their
past
and
consequently
they
would
be
used
up
in
the
course
of
time
if
nothing
returned
to
them
a
little
of
the
force
that
they
lose
through
these
incessant
conflicts
and
frictions
when
the
australians
scattered
in
little
groups
spend
their
time
in
hunting
and
fishing
they
lose
sight
of
what
concerns
their
clan
or
tribe
their
only
thought
is
to
catch
as
much
game
as
possible
on
feast
days
on
the
contrary
these
preoccupations
are
necessarily
eclipsed
being
essentially
profane
they
are
excluded
from
these
sacred
periods
at
this
time
their
thoughts
are
centred
upon
their
common
beliefs
their
common
traditions
the
memory
of
their
great
ancestors
the
collective
ideal
of
which
they
are
the
incarnation
in
a
word
upon
social
things
even
the
material
interests
which
these
great
religious
ceremonies
are
designed
to
satisfy
concern
the
public
order
and
are
therefore
social
society
as
a
whole
is
interested
that
the
harvest
be
abundant
that
the
rain
fall
at
the
right
time
and
not
excessively
that
the
animals
reproduce
regularly
so
it
is
society
that
is
in
the
foreground
of
every
consciousness
it
dominates
and
directs
all
conduct
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
it
is
more
living
and
active
and
consequently
more
real
than
in
profane
times
so
men
do
not
deceive
themselves
when
they
feel
at
this
time
that
there
is
something
outside
of
them
which
is
born
again
that
there
are
forces
which
are
reanimated
and
a
life
which
reawakens
this
renewal
is
in
no
way
imaginary
and
the
individuals
themselves
profit
from
it
for
the
spark
of
a
social
being
which
each
bears
within
him
necessarily
participates
in
this
collective
renovation
the
individual
soul
is
regenerated
too
by
being
dipped
again
in
the
source
from
which
its
life
comes
consequently
it
feels
itself
stronger
more
fully
master
of
itself
less
dependent
upon
physical
necessities
we
know
that
the
positive
cult
naturally
tends
to
take
periodic
forms
this
is
one
of
its
distinctive
features
of
course
there
are
rites
which
men
celebrate
occasionally
in
connection
with
passing
situations
but
these
episodic
practices
are
always
merely
accessory
and
in
the
religions
studied
in
this
book
they
are
almost
exceptional
the
essential
constituent
of
the
cult
is
the
cycle
of
feasts
which
return
regularly
at
determined
epochs
we
are
now
able
to
understand
whence
this
tendency
towards
periodicity
comes
the
rhythm
which
the
religious
life
follows
only
expresses
the
rhythm
of
the
social
life
and
results
from
it
society
is
able
to
revivify
the
sentiment
it
has
of
itself
only
by
assembling
but
it
can
not
be
assembled
all
the
time
the
exigencies
of
life
do
not
allow
it
to
remain
in
congregation
indefinitely
so
it
scatters
to
assemble
anew
when
it
again
feels
the
need
of
this
it
is
to
these
necessary
alternations
that
the
regular
alternations
of
sacred
and
profane
times
correspond
since
the
apparent
object
at
least
of
the
cult
was
at
first
to
regularize
the
course
of
natural
phenomena
the
rhythm
of
the
cosmic
life
has
put
its
mark
on
the
rhythm
of
the
ritual
life
this
is
why
the
feasts
have
long
been
associated
with
the
seasons
we
have
seen
this
characteristic
already
in
the
intichiuma
of
australia
but
the
seasons
have
only
furnished
the
outer
for
this
organization
and
not
the
principle
upon
which
it
rests
for
even
the
cults
which
aim
at
exclusively
spiritual
ends
have
remained
periodical
so
this
periodicity
must
be
due
to
other
causes
since
the
seasonal
changes
are
critical
periods
for
nature
they
are
a
natural
occasion
for
assembling
and
consequently
for
religious
ceremonies
but
other
events
can
and
have
successfully
fulfilled
this
function
of
occasional
cause
however
it
must
be
recognized
that
this
though
purely
external
has
given
proof
of
a
singular
resistive
force
for
traces
of
it
are
found
even
in
the
religions
which
are
the
most
fully
detached
from
all
physical
bases
many
christian
celebrations
are
founded
with
no
break
of
continuity
on
the
pastoral
and
agrarian
feasts
of
the
ancient
hebrews
although
in
themselves
they
are
neither
pastoral
nor
agrarian
moreover
this
rhythm
is
capable
of
varying
in
different
societies
where
the
period
of
dispersion
is
long
and
the
dispersion
itself
is
extreme
the
period
of
congregation
in
its
turn
is
very
prolonged
and
produces
veritable
debauches
of
collective
and
religions
life
feasts
succeed
one
another
for
weeks
or
even
for
months
while
the
ritual
life
sometimes
attains
to
a
sort
of
frenzy
this
is
what
happens
among
the
australian
tribes
and
many
of
the
tribes
of
america
elsewhere
on
the
contrary
these
two
phases
of
the
social
life
succeed
one
another
after
shorter
intervals
and
then
the
contrast
between
them
is
less
marked
the
more
societies
develop
the
less
they
seem
to
allow
of
too
great
intermittences
chapter
iii
the
positive
cult
rites
and
the
principle
of
but
the
processes
which
we
have
just
been
describing
are
not
the
only
ones
employed
to
assure
the
fecundity
of
the
totemic
species
there
are
others
which
serve
for
the
same
end
whether
they
accompany
the
preceding
ones
or
replace
them
i
in
the
very
ceremonies
which
we
have
been
describing
in
addition
to
the
oblations
whether
bloody
or
otherwise
there
are
other
rites
which
are
frequently
celebrated
whose
object
is
to
complete
the
former
ones
and
to
consolidate
their
effects
they
consist
in
movements
and
cries
whose
object
is
to
imitate
the
different
attitudes
and
aspects
of
the
animal
whose
reproduction
is
desired
therefore
we
shall
call
them
thus
the
intichiuma
of
the
witchetty
grub
among
the
arunta
includes
more
than
the
rites
performed
upon
the
sacred
rocks
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
when
these
are
finished
the
men
set
out
to
return
to
camp
but
when
they
still
are
about
a
mile
away
they
halt
and
all
decorate
themselves
ritually
after
this
the
march
is
resumed
the
decorations
with
which
they
thus
adorn
themselves
announce
that
an
important
ceremony
is
going
to
take
place
and
in
fact
while
the
company
was
absent
one
of
the
old
men
who
had
been
left
to
guard
the
camp
had
built
a
shelter
out
of
branches
called
which
represented
the
chrysalis
out
of
which
the
insect
comes
all
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
the
previous
ceremonies
assemble
near
the
spot
where
this
construction
has
been
raised
then
they
advance
slowly
stopping
from
time
to
time
until
they
reach
the
which
they
enter
at
once
all
the
men
who
do
not
belong
to
the
phratry
of
the
witchetty
grub
totem
and
who
assist
at
the
scene
though
from
a
distance
lie
down
on
the
ground
with
their
faces
against
the
earth
they
must
remain
in
this
position
without
moving
until
they
are
allowed
to
get
up
again
meanwhile
a
chant
arises
from
the
interior
of
the
umbana
which
describes
the
different
phases
through
which
the
animal
passes
in
the
course
of
its
development
and
the
myths
of
which
the
sacred
rocks
are
the
subject
when
this
hymn
ceases
the
alatunja
glides
out
of
the
though
remaining
in
a
squatting
position
and
advances
slowly
over
the
ground
before
him
he
is
followed
by
all
his
companions
who
reproduce
gestures
whose
evident
object
is
to
represent
the
insect
as
it
leaves
the
chrysalis
also
a
hymn
which
is
heard
at
just
this
moment
and
which
is
like
an
oral
commentary
on
the
rite
consists
in
a
description
of
the
movements
made
by
the
insect
at
this
stage
of
its
development
another
intichiuma
celebrated
in
connection
with
another
kind
of
grub
the
grub
has
this
character
still
more
clearly
the
actors
of
this
rite
decorate
themselves
with
designs
representing
the
bush
upon
which
this
grub
lives
at
the
beginning
of
its
existence
then
they
cover
a
buckler
with
concentric
circles
of
down
representing
another
kind
of
bush
upon
which
the
insect
lays
its
eggs
when
it
has
become
adult
when
all
these
preparations
are
finished
they
all
sit
down
on
the
ground
in
a
semicircle
facing
the
principal
officiant
he
alternately
bends
his
body
double
by
leaning
towards
the
ground
and
then
rises
on
his
knees
at
the
same
time
he
shakes
his
arms
which
is
a
way
of
representing
the
wings
of
the
insect
from
time
to
time
he
leans
over
the
buckler
imitating
the
way
in
which
the
butterfly
flies
over
the
trees
where
it
lays
its
eggs
when
this
ceremony
is
finished
another
commences
at
a
different
spot
to
which
they
go
in
silence
this
time
they
use
two
bucklers
upon
one
the
tracks
of
the
grub
are
represented
by
zigzag
lines
upon
the
other
concentric
circles
of
uneven
dimensions
represent
the
eggs
of
the
insect
and
the
seed
of
the
eremophile
bush
upon
which
it
is
nourished
as
in
the
former
ceremony
they
all
sit
down
in
silence
while
the
officiant
acts
representing
the
movements
of
the
animal
when
leaving
its
chrysalis
and
taking
its
first
flight
spencer
and
gillen
also
point
out
certain
analogous
facts
among
the
arunta
though
these
are
of
a
minor
importance
in
the
intichiuma
of
the
emu
for
example
at
a
certain
moment
the
actors
try
to
reproduce
by
their
attitude
the
air
and
aspect
of
this
bird
in
the
intichiuma
of
water
the
men
of
the
totem
utter
the
characteristic
cry
of
the
plover
a
cry
which
is
naturally
associated
in
the
mind
with
the
rainy
season
but
in
all
the
examples
of
imitative
rites
which
these
two
explorers
have
noted
are
rather
few
in
number
however
it
is
certain
that
their
relative
silence
on
this
point
is
due
either
to
their
not
having
observed
the
intichiuma
sufficiently
or
else
to
their
having
neglected
this
side
of
the
ceremonies
schulze
on
the
other
hand
has
been
struck
by
the
essentially
imitative
nature
of
the
arunta
rites
the
sacred
corrobbori
he
says
are
generally
ceremonies
representing
animals
he
calls
them
and
his
testimony
is
now
confirmed
by
the
documents
collected
by
strehlow
the
examples
given
by
this
latter
author
are
so
numerous
that
it
is
impossible
to
cite
them
all
there
are
scarcely
any
ceremonies
in
which
some
imitating
gesture
is
not
pointed
out
according
to
the
nature
of
the
animals
whose
feast
is
celebrated
they
jump
after
the
manner
of
kangaroos
or
imitate
the
movements
they
make
in
eating
the
flight
of
winged
ants
the
characteristic
noise
of
the
bat
the
cry
of
the
wild
turkey
the
hissing
of
the
snake
the
croaking
of
the
frog
etc
when
the
totem
is
a
plant
they
make
the
gesture
of
plucking
it
or
eating
it
etc
among
the
warramunga
the
intichiuma
generally
takes
a
special
form
which
we
shall
describe
in
the
next
chapter
and
which
differs
from
those
which
we
have
studied
up
to
the
present
however
there
is
one
typical
case
of
a
purely
imitative
intichiuma
among
this
people
it
is
that
of
the
black
cockatoo
the
ceremony
described
by
spencer
and
gillen
commenced
at
ten
in
the
evening
all
night
long
the
chief
of
the
clan
imitated
the
cry
of
the
bird
with
a
disheartening
monotony
he
stopped
only
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
force
and
then
his
son
replaced
him
then
he
commenced
again
as
soon
as
he
felt
a
little
refreshed
these
exhausting
exercises
continued
until
morning
without
interruption
living
beings
are
not
the
only
ones
which
they
try
to
imitate
in
a
large
number
of
tribes
the
intichiuma
of
rain
consists
essentially
in
imitative
rites
one
of
the
most
simple
of
these
is
that
celebrated
among
the
arabunna
the
chief
of
the
clan
is
seated
on
the
ground
all
covered
with
white
down
and
holding
a
lance
in
his
hands
he
shakes
himself
undoubtedly
in
order
to
detach
from
his
body
the
down
which
is
fixed
there
and
which
represents
clouds
when
scattered
about
in
the
air
thus
he
imitates
the
of
the
alcheringa
who
according
to
the
legend
had
the
habit
of
ascending
to
heaven
and
forming
clouds
there
from
which
the
rain
then
fell
in
a
word
the
object
of
the
whole
rite
is
to
represent
the
formation
and
ascension
of
clouds
the
bringers
of
rain
the
ceremony
is
much
more
complicated
among
the
kaitish
we
have
already
spoken
of
one
of
the
means
employed
the
officiant
pours
water
over
the
sacred
stones
and
himself
but
the
action
of
this
sort
of
oblation
is
reinforced
by
other
rites
the
rainbow
is
considered
to
have
a
close
connection
with
rain
they
say
that
it
is
its
son
and
that
it
is
always
urged
to
appear
to
make
the
rain
stop
to
make
the
rain
fall
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
it
should
not
appear
they
believe
that
this
result
can
be
obtained
in
the
following
manner
a
design
representing
a
rainbow
is
made
upon
a
buckler
they
carry
this
buckler
to
camp
taking
care
to
keep
it
hidden
from
all
eyes
they
are
convinced
that
by
making
this
image
of
the
rainbow
invisible
they
keep
the
rainbow
itself
from
appearing
meanwhile
the
chief
of
the
clan
having
beside
him
a
full
of
water
throws
in
all
directions
flakes
of
down
which
represent
clouds
repeated
imitations
of
the
cry
of
the
plover
complete
this
ceremony
which
seems
to
have
an
especial
gravity
for
as
long
as
it
lasts
all
those
who
participate
in
it
either
as
actors
or
assistants
may
have
no
relations
whatsoever
with
their
wives
they
may
not
even
speak
to
them
the
processes
of
figuration
are
different
among
the
dieri
rain
is
not
represented
by
water
but
by
blood
which
the
men
cause
to
flow
from
their
veins
on
to
the
assistants
at
the
same
time
they
throw
handfuls
of
white
down
about
which
represent
clouds
a
hut
has
been
constructed
previously
in
which
they
now
place
two
large
stones
representing
piles
of
clouds
a
sign
of
rain
after
they
have
been
left
there
for
a
little
while
they
are
carried
a
little
distance
away
and
placed
as
high
as
possible
in
the
loftiest
tree
to
be
found
this
is
a
way
of
making
the
clouds
mount
into
the
sky
powdered
gypsum
is
then
thrown
into
a
for
when
he
sees
this
the
rain
spirit
soon
makes
the
clouds
appear
finally
all
the
men
young
and
old
assemble
around
the
hut
and
with
heads
lowered
they
charge
upon
it
they
rush
violently
through
it
repeating
the
operation
several
times
until
nothing
remains
of
the
whole
construction
except
the
supporting
posts
then
they
fall
upon
these
and
shake
and
pull
at
them
until
the
whole
thing
has
tumbled
down
the
operation
consisting
in
running
through
the
hut
is
supposed
to
represent
clouds
bursting
the
tumbling
down
of
the
construction
the
fall
of
rain
in
the
tribes
studied
by
clement
which
occupy
the
district
included
between
the
fontescue
and
fitzroy
rivers
certain
ceremonies
are
celebrated
whose
object
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
the
intichiuma
of
the
arunta
and
which
seem
to
be
for
the
most
part
essentially
imitative
these
peoples
give
the
name
to
certain
piles
of
stones
which
are
evidently
sacred
for
as
we
shall
see
they
are
the
object
of
important
rites
every
animal
every
plant
and
in
fact
every
totem
or
is
represented
by
a
which
a
special
clan
guards
the
analogy
between
these
and
the
sacred
rocks
of
the
arunta
is
easily
seen
when
kangaroos
for
example
become
rare
the
chief
of
the
clan
to
which
the
of
the
kangaroo
belongs
goes
to
it
with
a
certain
number
of
companions
here
various
rites
are
performed
the
chief
of
which
consist
in
jumping
around
the
as
kangaroos
jump
in
drinking
as
they
drink
and
in
a
word
in
imitating
all
their
most
characteristic
movements
the
weapons
used
in
hunting
the
animal
have
an
important
part
in
these
rites
they
brandish
them
throw
them
against
the
stones
etc
when
they
are
concerned
for
emus
they
go
to
the
of
the
emu
and
walk
and
run
as
these
birds
do
the
skill
which
the
natives
show
in
these
imitations
is
as
it
appears
really
remarkable
other
are
consecrated
to
plants
such
as
the
cereals
in
this
case
they
imitate
the
actions
of
threshing
and
grinding
the
grain
since
in
ordinary
life
it
is
the
women
who
are
normally
charged
with
these
tasks
it
is
also
they
who
perform
the
rite
in
the
midst
of
songs
and
dances
ii
all
these
rites
belong
to
the
same
type
the
principle
upon
which
they
rest
is
one
of
those
at
the
basis
of
what
is
commonly
and
incorrectly
called
sympathetic
magic
these
principles
are
ordinarily
reduced
to
two
the
first
may
be
stated
thus
touching
an
object
also
touches
everything
which
has
any
relation
of
proximity
or
unity
whatsoever
with
this
thus
whatever
affects
the
part
also
affects
the
whole
any
action
exercised
over
an
individual
is
transmitted
to
his
neighbours
relatives
and
all
those
to
whom
he
is
united
in
any
way
all
these
cases
are
simple
applications
of
the
law
of
contagion
which
we
have
already
studied
a
condition
or
a
good
or
bad
quality
are
communicated
contagiously
from
one
subject
to
another
who
has
some
connection
with
the
former
the
second
principle
is
ordinarily
summed
up
in
the
formula
produces
the
representation
of
a
being
or
condition
produces
this
being
or
condition
this
is
the
maxim
which
brings
about
the
rites
which
we
have
just
been
describing
and
it
is
in
them
that
we
can
best
observe
its
characteristics
the
classical
example
of
the
magic
charm
which
is
ordinarily
given
as
the
typical
application
of
this
same
precept
is
much
less
significant
the
charm
is
to
a
large
extent
a
simple
phenomenon
of
transfer
the
idea
of
the
image
is
associated
in
the
mind
with
that
of
the
model
consequently
the
effects
of
an
action
performed
upon
a
statue
are
transmitted
contagiously
to
the
person
whose
traits
it
reproduces
the
function
of
the
image
is
for
its
original
what
that
of
a
part
is
for
the
whole
it
is
an
agent
of
transmission
therefore
men
think
that
they
can
obtain
the
same
result
by
burning
the
hair
of
the
person
whom
they
wish
to
injure
the
only
difference
between
these
two
sorts
of
operations
is
that
in
one
the
communication
is
made
through
similarity
while
in
the
other
it
is
by
means
of
contiguity
it
is
different
with
the
rites
which
concern
us
they
suppose
not
only
the
displacement
of
a
given
condition
or
quality
which
passes
from
one
object
into
the
other
but
also
the
creation
of
something
entirely
new
the
mere
act
of
representing
the
animal
gives
birth
to
this
animal
and
creates
it
by
imitating
the
sound
of
wind
or
falling
water
they
cause
clouds
to
form
rain
to
fall
etc
of
course
resemblance
plays
an
important
part
in
each
case
but
not
at
all
the
same
one
in
a
charm
it
only
gives
a
special
direction
to
the
action
exercised
it
directs
in
a
certain
way
an
action
not
originating
in
it
in
the
rites
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
it
acts
by
itself
and
is
directly
efficacious
so
in
contradiction
to
the
usual
definitions
the
real
difference
between
the
two
principles
of
the
sympathetic
magic
and
the
corresponding
practices
is
not
that
it
is
contiguity
acts
in
one
case
and
resemblance
in
the
other
but
that
in
the
former
there
is
a
simple
contagious
communication
while
there
is
production
and
creation
in
the
latter
the
explanation
of
imitative
rites
therefore
implies
the
explanation
of
the
second
of
these
principles
and
reciprocally
we
shall
not
tarry
long
to
discuss
the
explanation
proposed
by
the
anthropological
school
and
especially
by
tylor
and
frazer
just
as
in
their
attempts
to
account
for
the
contagiousness
of
a
sacred
character
they
invoke
the
association
of
ideas
hom
oe
opathic
magic
says
frazer
who
prefers
this
expression
to
imitative
magic
is
founded
on
the
association
of
ideas
by
similarity
contagious
magic
is
founded
on
the
association
of
ideas
by
contiguity
hom
oe
opathic
magic
commits
the
mistake
of
assuming
that
things
which
resemble
each
other
are
the
same
but
this
is
a
misunderstanding
of
the
special
nature
of
the
practices
under
discussion
on
the
one
hand
the
formula
of
frazer
may
be
applied
with
some
fitness
to
the
case
of
charms
here
in
fact
two
distinct
things
are
associated
with
each
other
owing
to
their
partial
resemblance
these
are
the
image
and
the
model
which
it
represents
more
or
less
systematically
but
in
the
imitative
rites
which
we
have
just
been
observing
the
image
alone
is
given
as
for
the
model
it
does
not
exist
for
the
new
generation
of
the
totemic
species
is
as
yet
only
a
hope
and
even
an
uncertain
hope
at
that
so
there
could
be
no
question
of
association
whether
correct
or
not
there
is
a
real
creation
and
we
can
not
see
how
the
association
of
ideas
could
possibly
lead
to
a
belief
in
this
creation
how
could
the
mere
act
of
representing
the
movements
of
an
animal
bring
about
the
certitude
that
this
animal
will
be
born
and
born
in
abundance
the
general
properties
of
human
nature
can
not
explain
such
special
practices
so
instead
of
considering
the
principle
upon
which
they
rest
in
its
general
and
abstract
form
let
us
replace
it
in
the
environment
of
which
it
is
a
part
and
where
we
have
been
observing
it
and
let
us
connect
it
with
the
system
of
ideas
and
sentiments
which
the
above
rites
put
into
practice
and
then
we
shall
be
better
able
to
perceive
the
causes
from
which
it
results
the
men
who
assemble
on
the
occasion
of
these
rites
believe
that
they
are
really
animals
or
plants
of
the
species
whose
name
they
bear
they
feel
within
them
an
animal
or
vegetable
nature
and
in
their
eyes
this
is
what
constitutes
whatever
is
the
most
essential
and
the
most
excellent
in
them
so
when
they
assemble
their
first
movement
ought
to
be
to
show
each
other
this
quality
which
they
attribute
to
themselves
and
by
which
they
are
defined
the
totem
is
their
rallying
sign
for
this
reason
as
we
have
seen
they
design
it
upon
their
bodies
but
it
is
no
less
natural
that
they
should
seek
to
resemble
it
in
their
gestures
their
cries
their
attitude
since
they
are
emus
or
kangaroos
they
comport
themselves
like
the
animals
of
the
same
name
by
this
means
they
mutually
show
one
another
that
they
are
all
members
of
the
same
moral
community
and
they
become
conscious
of
the
kinship
uniting
them
the
rite
does
not
limit
itself
to
expressing
this
kinship
it
makes
it
or
remakes
it
for
it
exists
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
believed
in
and
the
effect
of
all
these
collective
demonstrations
is
to
support
the
beliefs
upon
which
they
are
founded
therefore
these
leaps
these
cries
and
these
movements
of
every
sort
though
bizarre
and
grotesque
in
appearance
really
have
a
profound
and
human
meaning
the
australian
seeks
to
resemble
his
totem
just
as
the
faithful
in
more
advanced
religions
seek
to
resemble
their
god
for
the
one
as
for
the
other
this
is
a
means
of
communicating
with
the
sacred
being
that
is
to
say
with
the
collective
ideal
which
this
latter
symbolizes
this
is
an
early
form
of
the
greek
homoiôsis
tô
theô
however
as
this
first
reason
is
connected
with
the
most
specialized
portions
of
the
totemic
beliefs
the
principle
by
which
like
produces
like
should
not
have
survived
totemism
if
this
had
been
the
only
one
in
operation
now
there
is
probably
no
religion
in
which
rites
derived
from
it
are
not
found
so
another
reason
must
with
this
first
one
and
in
fact
the
ceremonies
where
we
have
seen
it
applied
do
not
merely
have
the
very
general
object
which
we
have
just
mentioned
howsoever
essential
this
may
be
they
also
aim
at
a
more
immediate
and
more
conscious
end
which
is
the
assurance
of
the
reproduction
of
the
totemic
species
the
idea
of
this
necessary
reproduction
haunts
the
minds
of
the
worshippers
upon
it
the
forces
of
their
attention
and
will
are
concentrated
now
a
single
preoccupation
can
not
possess
a
group
of
men
to
this
point
without
being
externalized
in
a
material
form
since
all
think
of
the
animal
or
plant
to
whose
destinies
the
clan
is
united
it
is
inevitable
that
this
common
thought
should
not
be
manifested
outwardly
by
gestures
and
those
naturally
designated
for
this
office
are
those
which
represent
this
animal
or
plant
in
one
of
its
most
characteristic
attitudes
there
are
no
other
movements
so
close
to
the
idea
filling
every
mind
for
these
are
an
immediate
and
almost
automatic
translation
of
it
so
they
make
themselves
imitate
the
animal
they
cry
like
it
they
jump
like
it
they
reproduce
the
scenes
in
which
they
make
daily
use
of
the
plant
all
these
ways
of
representation
are
just
so
many
means
of
ostensibly
showing
the
end
towards
which
all
minds
are
directed
of
telling
the
thing
which
they
wish
to
realize
of
calling
it
up
and
of
evoking
it
and
this
need
belongs
to
no
one
time
nor
does
it
depend
upon
the
beliefs
of
any
special
religion
it
is
essentially
human
this
is
why
even
in
religions
very
far
removed
from
those
we
have
been
studying
the
worshippers
when
assembled
to
ask
their
gods
for
some
event
which
they
ardently
desire
are
forced
to
figure
it
of
course
the
word
is
also
a
way
of
expressing
it
but
the
gesture
is
no
less
natural
it
bursts
out
from
the
organism
just
as
spontaneously
it
even
precedes
the
word
or
in
any
case
accompanies
it
but
if
we
can
thus
understand
how
the
gestures
acquired
a
place
in
the
ceremony
we
still
must
explain
the
efficacy
attributed
to
them
if
the
australian
repeats
them
regularly
each
new
season
it
is
because
he
believes
them
essential
to
the
success
of
the
rite
where
could
he
have
gotten
the
idea
that
by
imitating
an
animal
one
causes
it
to
reproduce
so
manifest
an
error
seems
hardly
intelligible
so
long
as
we
see
in
the
rite
only
the
material
end
towards
which
it
seems
to
aim
but
we
know
that
in
addition
to
the
effect
which
it
is
thought
to
have
on
the
totemic
species
it
also
exercises
a
profound
influence
over
the
souls
of
the
worshippers
who
take
part
in
it
they
take
away
with
them
a
feeling
of
whose
causes
they
can
not
clearly
see
but
which
is
well
founded
they
feel
that
the
ceremony
is
good
for
them
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
reforge
their
moral
nature
in
it
how
could
this
sort
of
fail
to
give
them
a
feeling
that
the
rite
has
succeeded
that
it
has
been
what
it
set
out
to
be
and
that
it
has
attained
the
ends
at
which
it
was
aimed
as
the
only
end
which
was
consciously
sought
was
the
reproduction
of
the
totemic
species
this
seems
to
be
assured
by
the
means
employed
the
efficacy
of
which
is
thus
proven
thus
it
comes
about
that
men
attribute
creative
virtues
to
their
gestures
which
in
themselves
are
vain
the
moral
efficacy
of
the
rite
which
is
real
leads
to
the
belief
in
its
physical
efficacy
which
is
imaginary
that
of
the
whole
to
the
belief
in
that
of
each
part
by
itself
the
truly
useful
effects
produced
by
the
whole
ceremony
are
like
an
experimental
justification
of
the
elementary
practices
out
of
which
it
is
made
though
in
reality
all
these
practices
are
in
no
way
indispensable
to
its
success
a
certain
proof
moreover
that
they
do
not
act
by
themselves
is
that
they
may
be
replaced
by
others
of
a
very
different
nature
without
any
modification
of
the
final
result
it
appears
that
there
are
intichiuma
which
include
only
oblations
with
no
imitative
rites
others
are
purely
imitative
and
include
no
oblations
however
both
are
believed
to
have
the
same
efficacy
so
if
a
price
is
attached
to
these
various
man
oe
uvres
it
is
not
because
of
their
intrinsic
value
but
because
they
are
a
part
of
a
complex
rite
whose
utility
as
a
whole
is
realized
we
are
able
to
understand
this
state
of
mind
all
the
easier
because
we
can
still
observe
it
about
us
especially
among
the
most
cultivated
peoples
and
environments
we
frequently
meet
with
believers
who
though
having
doubts
as
to
the
special
efficacy
attributed
by
dogma
to
each
rite
considered
separately
still
continue
to
participate
in
the
cult
they
are
not
sure
that
the
details
of
the
prescribed
observances
are
rationally
justifiable
but
they
feel
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
free
oneself
of
them
without
falling
into
a
moral
confusion
before
which
they
recoil
the
very
fact
that
in
them
the
faith
has
lost
its
intellectual
foundations
throws
into
eminence
the
profound
reasons
upon
which
they
rest
this
is
why
the
easy
criticisms
to
which
an
unduly
simple
rationalism
has
sometimes
submitted
ritual
prescriptions
generally
leave
the
believer
indifferent
it
is
because
the
true
justification
of
religious
practices
does
not
lie
in
the
apparent
ends
which
they
pursue
but
rather
in
the
invisible
action
which
they
exercise
over
the
mind
and
in
the
way
in
which
they
affect
our
mental
status
likewise
when
preachers
undertake
to
convince
they
devote
much
less
attention
to
establishing
directly
and
by
methodical
proofs
the
truth
of
any
particular
proposition
or
the
utility
of
such
and
such
an
observance
than
to
awakening
or
reawakening
the
sentiment
of
the
moral
comfort
attained
by
the
regular
celebration
of
the
cult
thus
they
create
a
predisposition
to
belief
which
precedes
proofs
which
leads
the
mind
to
overlook
the
insufficiency
of
the
logical
reasons
and
which
thus
prepares
it
for
the
proposition
whose
acceptance
is
desired
this
favourable
prejudice
this
impulse
towards
believing
is
just
what
constitutes
faith
and
it
is
faith
which
makes
the
authority
of
the
rites
according
to
the
believer
whoever
he
may
be
christian
or
australian
the
only
superiority
of
the
former
is
that
he
better
accounts
for
the
psychological
process
from
which
his
faith
results
he
knows
that
it
is
faith
that
saves
it
is
because
faith
has
this
origin
that
it
is
in
a
sense
impermeable
to
experience
if
the
intermittent
failures
of
the
intichiuma
do
not
shake
the
confidence
of
the
australian
in
his
rite
it
is
because
he
holds
with
all
the
strength
of
his
soul
to
these
practices
in
which
he
periodically
recreates
himself
he
could
not
deny
their
principle
without
causing
an
upheaval
of
his
own
being
which
resists
but
howsoever
great
this
force
of
resistance
may
be
it
can
not
radically
distinguish
religious
mentality
from
the
other
forms
of
human
mentality
even
those
which
are
the
most
habitually
opposed
to
it
in
this
connection
that
of
a
scholar
differs
from
the
preceding
only
in
degree
when
a
scientific
law
has
the
authority
of
numerous
and
varied
experiments
it
is
against
all
method
to
renounce
it
too
quickly
upon
the
discovery
of
a
fact
which
seems
to
contradict
it
it
is
still
necessary
to
make
sure
that
the
fact
does
not
allow
of
a
single
interpretation
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
account
for
it
without
abandoning
the
proposition
which
it
seems
to
invalidate
now
the
australian
does
not
proceed
otherwise
when
he
attributes
the
failure
of
the
intichiuma
to
some
sorcery
or
the
abundance
of
a
premature
crop
to
a
mystic
intichiuma
celebrated
in
the
beyond
he
has
all
the
more
reason
for
not
doubting
his
rite
on
the
belief
in
a
contrary
fact
since
its
value
is
or
seems
to
be
established
by
a
larger
number
of
harmonizing
facts
in
the
first
place
the
moral
efficacy
of
the
ceremony
is
real
and
is
felt
directly
by
all
who
participate
in
it
there
is
a
constantly
renewed
experience
in
it
whose
importance
no
contradictory
experience
can
diminish
also
the
physical
efficacy
itself
is
not
unable
to
find
an
at
least
apparent
confirmation
in
the
data
of
objective
observation
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
totemic
species
normally
does
reproduce
regularly
so
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
everything
happens
just
as
if
the
ritual
gestures
really
did
produce
the
effects
expected
of
them
failures
are
the
exception
as
the
rites
and
especially
those
which
are
periodical
demand
nothing
more
of
nature
than
that
it
follow
its
ordinary
course
it
is
not
surprising
that
it
should
generally
have
the
air
of
obeying
them
so
if
the
believer
shows
himself
indocile
to
certain
lessons
of
experience
he
does
so
because
of
other
experiences
which
seem
more
demonstrative
the
scholar
does
not
do
otherwise
only
he
introduces
more
method
so
magic
is
not
as
frazer
has
held
an
original
fact
of
which
religion
is
only
a
derived
form
quite
on
the
contrary
it
was
under
the
influence
of
religious
ideas
that
the
precepts
upon
which
the
art
of
the
magician
is
based
were
established
and
it
was
only
through
a
secondary
extension
that
they
were
applied
to
purely
lay
relations
since
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
have
been
conceived
on
the
model
of
the
sacred
forces
the
contagiousness
inherent
in
the
second
was
extended
to
the
first
and
men
have
believed
that
all
the
properties
of
a
body
could
be
transmitted
contagiously
likewise
when
the
principle
according
to
which
like
produces
like
had
been
established
in
order
to
satisfy
certain
religious
needs
it
detached
itself
from
its
ritual
origins
to
become
through
a
sort
of
spontaneous
generalization
a
law
of
nature
but
in
order
to
understand
these
fundamental
axioms
of
magic
they
must
be
replaced
in
the
religious
atmosphere
in
which
they
arose
and
which
alone
enables
us
to
account
for
them
when
we
regard
them
as
the
work
of
isolated
individuals
or
solitary
magicians
we
ask
how
they
could
ever
have
occurred
to
the
mind
of
man
for
nothing
in
experience
could
either
suggest
or
verify
them
and
especially
we
do
not
explain
how
so
deceiving
an
art
has
been
able
to
impose
itself
for
so
long
a
time
in
the
confidence
of
men
but
this
problem
disappears
when
we
realize
that
the
faith
inspired
by
magic
is
only
a
particular
case
of
religious
faith
in
general
and
that
it
is
itself
the
product
at
least
indirectly
of
a
collective
effervescence
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
use
of
the
expression
sympathetic
magic
to
designate
the
system
of
rites
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
is
not
very
exact
there
are
sympathetic
rites
but
they
are
not
peculiar
to
magic
not
only
are
they
to
be
found
in
religion
but
it
was
from
religion
that
magic
received
them
so
we
only
risk
confusion
when
by
the
name
we
give
them
we
have
the
air
of
making
them
something
which
is
specifically
magic
the
results
of
our
analysis
thus
attach
themselves
to
and
confirm
those
attained
by
mm
hubert
and
mauss
when
they
studied
magic
directly
they
have
shown
that
this
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
crude
industry
based
on
incomplete
science
behind
the
mechanisms
purely
laical
in
appearance
which
are
used
by
the
magician
they
point
out
a
background
of
religious
conceptions
and
a
whole
world
of
forces
the
idea
of
which
has
been
taken
by
magic
from
religion
we
are
now
able
to
understand
how
it
comes
that
magic
is
so
full
of
religious
elements
it
is
because
it
was
born
of
religion
iii
but
the
principle
which
has
just
been
set
forth
does
not
merely
have
a
function
in
the
ritual
it
is
of
direct
interest
for
the
theory
of
knowledge
in
fact
it
is
a
concrete
statement
of
the
law
of
causality
and
in
all
probability
one
of
the
most
primitive
statements
of
it
which
has
ever
existed
a
full
conception
of
the
causal
relation
is
implied
in
the
power
thus
attributed
to
the
like
to
produce
the
like
and
this
conception
dominates
primitive
thought
for
it
is
the
basis
both
of
the
practices
of
the
cult
and
the
technique
of
the
magician
so
the
origins
of
the
precept
upon
which
the
imitative
rites
depend
are
able
to
clarify
those
of
the
principle
of
causality
the
genesis
of
one
should
aid
us
in
understanding
the
genesis
of
the
other
now
we
have
shown
how
the
former
is
a
product
of
social
causes
it
was
elaborated
by
groups
having
collective
ends
in
view
and
it
translates
collective
sentiments
so
we
may
assume
that
the
same
is
true
for
the
second
in
fact
an
analysis
of
the
principle
of
causality
is
sufficient
to
assure
us
that
the
diverse
elements
of
which
it
is
composed
really
did
have
this
origin
the
first
thing
which
is
implied
in
the
notion
of
the
causal
relation
is
the
idea
of
efficacy
of
productive
power
of
active
force
by
cause
we
ordinarily
mean
something
capable
of
producing
a
certain
change
the
cause
is
the
force
before
it
has
shown
the
power
which
is
in
it
the
effect
is
this
same
power
only
actualized
men
have
always
thought
of
causality
in
dynamic
terms
of
course
certain
philosophers
had
refused
all
objective
value
to
this
conception
they
see
in
it
only
an
arbitrary
construction
of
the
imagination
which
corresponds
to
nothing
in
the
things
themselves
but
at
present
we
have
no
need
of
asking
whether
it
is
founded
in
reality
or
not
it
is
enough
for
us
to
state
that
it
exists
and
that
it
constitutes
and
always
has
constituted
an
element
of
ordinary
mentality
and
this
is
recognized
even
by
those
who
criticize
it
our
immediate
purpose
is
to
seek
not
what
it
may
be
worth
logically
but
how
it
is
to
be
explained
now
it
depends
upon
social
causes
our
analysis
of
facts
has
already
enabled
us
to
see
that
the
prototype
of
the
idea
of
force
was
the
mana
wakan
orenda
the
totemic
principle
or
any
of
the
various
names
given
to
collective
force
objectified
and
projected
into
things
the
first
power
which
men
have
thought
of
as
such
seems
to
have
been
that
exercised
by
humanity
over
its
members
thus
reason
confirms
the
results
of
observation
in
fact
it
is
even
possible
to
show
why
this
notion
of
power
efficacy
or
active
force
could
not
have
come
from
any
other
source
in
the
first
place
it
is
evident
and
recognized
by
all
that
it
could
not
be
furnished
to
us
by
external
experience
our
senses
only
enable
us
to
perceive
phenomena
which
coexist
or
which
follow
one
another
but
nothing
perceived
by
them
could
give
us
the
idea
of
this
determining
and
compelling
action
which
is
characteristic
of
what
we
call
a
power
or
force
they
can
touch
only
realized
and
known
conditions
each
separate
from
the
others
the
internal
process
uniting
these
conditions
escapes
them
nothing
that
we
learn
could
possibly
suggest
to
us
the
idea
of
what
an
influence
or
efficaciousness
is
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
the
philosophers
of
empiricism
have
regarded
these
different
conceptions
as
so
many
mythological
aberrations
but
even
supposing
that
they
all
are
hallucinations
it
is
still
necessary
to
show
how
they
originated
if
external
experience
counts
for
nothing
in
the
origin
of
these
ideas
and
it
is
equally
inadmissible
that
they
were
given
us
one
might
suppose
that
they
come
from
internal
experience
in
fact
the
notion
of
force
obviously
includes
many
spiritual
elements
which
could
only
have
been
taken
from
our
psychic
life
some
have
believed
that
the
act
by
which
our
will
brings
a
deliberation
to
a
close
restrains
our
impulses
and
commands
our
organism
might
have
served
as
the
model
of
this
construction
in
willing
it
is
said
we
perceive
ourselves
directly
as
a
power
in
action
so
when
this
idea
had
once
occurred
to
men
it
seems
that
they
only
had
to
extend
it
to
things
to
establish
the
conception
of
force
as
long
as
the
animist
theory
passed
as
a
demonstrated
truth
this
explanation
was
able
to
appear
to
be
confirmed
by
history
if
the
forces
with
which
human
thought
primitively
populated
the
world
really
had
been
spirits
that
is
to
say
personal
and
conscious
beings
more
or
less
similar
to
men
it
was
actually
possible
to
believe
that
our
individual
experience
was
enough
to
furnish
us
with
the
constituent
elements
of
the
notion
of
force
but
we
know
that
the
first
forces
which
men
imagined
were
on
the
contrary
anonymous
vague
and
diffused
powers
which
resemble
cosmic
forces
in
their
impersonality
and
which
are
therefore
most
sharply
contrasted
with
the
eminently
personal
power
the
human
will
so
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
have
been
conceived
in
its
image
moreover
there
is
one
essential
characteristic
of
the
impersonal
forces
which
would
be
inexplicable
under
this
hypothesis
this
is
their
communicability
the
forces
of
nature
have
always
been
thought
of
as
capable
of
passing
from
one
object
to
another
of
mixing
combining
and
transforming
themselves
into
one
another
it
is
even
this
property
which
gives
them
their
value
as
an
explanation
for
it
is
through
this
that
effects
can
be
connected
with
their
causes
without
a
break
of
continuity
now
the
self
has
just
the
opposite
characteristic
it
is
incommunicable
it
can
not
change
its
material
substratum
or
spread
from
one
to
another
it
spreads
out
in
metaphor
only
so
the
way
in
which
it
decides
and
executes
its
decisions
could
never
have
suggested
the
idea
of
an
energy
which
communicates
itself
and
which
can
even
confound
itself
with
others
and
through
these
combinations
and
mixings
give
rise
to
new
effects
therefore
the
idea
of
force
as
implied
in
the
conception
of
the
causal
relation
must
present
a
double
character
in
the
first
place
it
can
come
only
from
our
internal
experience
the
only
forces
which
we
can
directly
learn
about
are
necessarily
moral
forces
but
at
the
same
time
they
must
be
impersonal
for
the
notion
of
an
impersonal
power
was
the
first
to
be
constituted
now
the
only
ones
which
satisfy
these
two
conditions
are
those
coming
from
life
together
they
are
collective
forces
in
fact
these
are
on
the
one
hand
entirely
psychical
they
are
made
up
exclusively
of
objectified
ideas
and
sentiments
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
impersonal
by
definition
for
they
are
the
product
of
a
being
the
work
of
all
they
are
not
the
possession
of
anybody
in
particular
they
are
so
slightly
attached
to
the
personalities
of
the
subjects
in
whom
they
reside
that
they
are
never
fixed
there
just
as
they
enter
them
from
without
they
are
also
always
ready
to
leave
them
of
themselves
they
tend
to
spread
further
and
further
and
to
invade
ever
new
domains
we
know
that
there
are
none
more
contagious
and
consequently
more
communicable
of
course
physical
forces
have
the
same
property
but
we
can
not
know
this
directly
we
can
not
even
become
acquainted
with
them
as
such
for
they
are
outside
us
when
i
throw
myself
against
an
obstacle
i
have
a
sensation
of
hindrance
and
trouble
but
the
force
causing
this
sensation
is
not
in
me
but
in
the
obstacle
and
is
consequently
outside
the
circle
of
my
perception
we
perceive
its
effects
but
we
can
not
reach
the
cause
itself
it
is
otherwise
with
social
forces
they
are
a
part
of
our
internal
life
as
we
know
more
than
the
products
of
their
action
we
see
them
acting
the
force
isolating
the
sacred
being
and
holding
profane
beings
at
a
distance
is
not
really
in
this
being
it
lives
in
the
minds
of
the
believers
so
they
perceive
it
at
the
very
moment
when
it
is
acting
upon
their
wills
to
inhibit
certain
movements
or
command
others
in
a
word
this
constraining
and
necessitating
action
which
escapes
us
when
coming
from
an
external
object
is
readily
perceptible
here
because
everything
is
inside
us
of
course
we
do
not
always
interpret
it
in
an
adequate
manner
but
at
least
we
can
not
fail
to
be
conscious
of
it
moreover
the
idea
of
force
bears
the
mark
of
its
origin
in
an
apparent
way
in
fact
it
implies
the
idea
of
power
which
in
its
turn
does
not
come
without
those
of
ascendancy
mastership
and
domination
and
their
corollaries
dependence
and
subordination
now
the
relations
expressed
by
all
these
ideas
are
eminently
social
it
is
society
which
classifies
beings
into
superiors
and
inferiors
into
commanding
masters
and
obeying
servants
it
is
society
which
confers
upon
the
former
the
singular
property
which
makes
the
command
efficacious
and
which
makes
so
everything
tends
to
prove
that
the
first
powers
of
which
the
human
mind
had
any
idea
were
those
which
societies
have
established
in
organizing
themselves
it
is
in
their
image
that
the
powers
of
the
physical
world
have
been
conceived
also
men
have
never
succeeded
in
imagining
themselves
as
forces
mistress
over
the
bodies
in
which
they
reside
except
by
introducing
concepts
taken
from
social
life
in
fact
these
must
be
distinguished
from
their
physical
doubles
and
must
be
attributed
a
dignity
superior
to
that
of
these
latter
in
a
word
they
must
think
of
themselves
as
souls
as
a
matter
of
fact
men
have
always
given
the
form
of
souls
to
the
forces
which
they
believe
that
they
are
but
we
know
that
the
soul
is
quite
another
thing
from
a
name
given
to
the
abstract
faculty
of
moving
thinking
and
feeling
before
all
it
is
a
religious
principle
a
particular
aspect
of
the
collective
force
in
fine
a
man
feels
that
he
has
a
soul
and
consequently
a
force
because
he
is
a
social
being
though
an
animal
moves
its
members
just
as
we
do
and
though
it
has
the
same
power
as
we
over
its
muscles
nothing
authorizes
us
to
suppose
that
it
is
conscious
of
itself
as
an
active
and
efficacious
cause
this
is
because
it
does
not
have
or
to
speak
more
exactly
does
not
attribute
to
itself
a
soul
but
if
it
does
not
attribute
a
soul
to
itself
it
is
because
it
does
not
participate
in
a
social
life
comparable
to
that
of
men
among
animals
there
is
nothing
resembling
a
civilization
but
the
notion
of
force
is
not
all
of
the
principle
of
causality
this
consists
in
a
judgment
stating
that
every
force
develops
in
a
definite
manner
and
that
the
state
in
which
it
is
at
each
particular
moment
of
its
existence
predetermines
the
next
state
the
former
is
called
cause
the
latter
effect
and
the
causal
judgment
affirms
the
existence
of
a
necessary
connection
between
these
two
moments
for
every
force
the
mind
posits
this
connection
before
having
any
proofs
of
it
under
the
empire
of
a
sort
of
constraint
from
which
it
can
not
free
itself
it
postulates
it
as
they
say
empiricism
has
never
succeeded
in
accounting
for
this
apriorism
and
necessity
philosophers
of
this
school
have
never
been
able
to
explain
how
an
association
of
ideas
reinforced
by
habit
could
produce
more
than
an
expectation
or
a
stronger
or
weaker
predisposition
on
the
part
of
ideas
to
appear
in
a
determined
order
but
the
principle
of
causality
has
quite
another
character
it
is
not
merely
an
imminent
tendency
of
our
thought
to
take
certain
forms
it
is
an
external
norm
superior
to
the
flow
of
our
representations
which
it
dominates
and
rules
imperatively
it
is
invested
with
an
authority
which
binds
the
mind
and
surpasses
it
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
mind
is
not
its
artisan
in
this
connection
it
is
useless
to
substitute
hereditary
habit
for
individual
habit
for
habit
does
not
change
its
nature
by
lasting
longer
than
one
man
life
it
is
merely
stronger
an
instinct
is
not
a
rule
the
rites
which
we
have
been
studying
allow
us
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
another
source
of
this
authority
which
up
to
the
present
has
scarcely
been
suspected
let
us
bear
in
mind
how
the
law
of
causality
which
the
imitative
rites
put
into
practice
was
born
being
filled
with
one
single
preoccupation
the
group
assembles
if
the
species
whose
name
it
bears
does
not
reproduce
it
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
whole
clan
the
common
sentiment
thus
animating
all
the
members
is
outwardly
expressed
by
certain
gestures
which
are
always
the
same
in
the
same
circumstances
and
after
the
ceremony
has
been
performed
it
happens
for
the
reasons
set
forth
that
the
desired
result
seems
obtained
so
an
association
arises
between
the
idea
of
this
result
and
that
of
the
gestures
preceding
it
and
this
association
does
not
vary
from
one
subject
to
another
it
is
the
same
for
all
the
participators
in
the
rite
since
it
is
the
product
of
a
collective
experience
however
if
no
other
factor
intervened
it
would
produce
only
a
collective
expectation
after
the
imitative
gestures
had
been
accomplished
everybody
would
await
the
subsequent
appearance
of
the
desired
event
with
more
or
less
confidence
an
imperative
rule
of
thought
could
never
be
established
by
this
but
since
a
social
interest
of
the
greatest
importance
is
at
stake
society
can
not
allow
things
to
follow
their
own
course
at
the
whim
of
circumstances
it
intervenes
actively
in
such
a
way
as
to
regulate
their
march
in
conformity
with
its
needs
so
it
demands
that
this
ceremony
which
it
can
not
do
without
be
repeated
every
time
that
it
is
necessary
and
consequently
that
the
movements
a
condition
of
its
success
be
executed
regularly
it
imposes
them
as
an
obligation
now
they
imply
a
certain
definite
state
of
mind
which
in
return
participates
in
this
same
obligatory
character
to
prescribe
that
one
must
imitate
an
animal
or
plant
to
make
them
reproduce
is
equivalent
to
stating
it
as
an
axiom
which
is
above
all
doubt
that
like
produces
like
opinion
can
not
allow
men
to
deny
this
principle
in
theory
without
also
allowing
them
to
violate
it
in
their
conduct
so
society
imposes
it
along
with
the
practices
which
are
derived
from
it
and
thus
the
ritual
precept
is
doubled
by
a
logical
precept
which
is
only
the
intellectual
aspect
of
the
former
the
authority
of
each
is
derived
from
the
same
source
society
the
respect
which
this
inspires
is
communicated
to
the
ways
of
thought
to
which
it
attaches
a
value
just
as
much
as
to
ways
of
action
so
a
man
can
not
set
aside
either
the
ones
or
the
others
without
hurling
himself
against
public
opinion
this
is
why
the
former
require
the
adherence
of
the
intelligence
before
examination
just
as
the
latter
require
the
submission
of
the
will
from
this
example
we
can
show
once
more
how
the
sociological
theory
of
the
idea
of
causality
and
of
the
categories
in
general
sets
aside
the
classical
doctrines
on
the
question
while
conciliating
them
together
with
apriorism
it
maintains
the
prejudicial
and
necessary
character
of
the
causal
relation
but
it
does
not
limit
itself
to
affirming
this
it
accounts
for
it
yet
without
making
it
vanish
under
the
pretext
of
explaining
it
as
empiricism
does
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
question
of
denying
the
part
due
to
individual
experience
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
by
himself
the
individual
observes
the
regular
succession
of
phenomena
and
thus
acquires
a
certain
of
regularity
but
this
feeling
is
not
the
of
causality
the
former
is
individual
subjective
incommunicable
we
make
it
ourselves
out
of
our
own
personal
observations
the
second
is
the
work
of
the
group
and
is
given
to
us
it
is
a
in
which
our
empirical
ascertainments
arrange
themselves
and
which
enables
us
to
think
of
them
that
is
to
say
to
see
them
from
a
point
of
view
which
makes
it
possible
for
us
to
understand
one
another
in
regard
to
them
of
course
if
this
frame
can
be
applied
to
the
contents
that
shows
that
it
is
not
out
of
relation
with
the
matter
which
it
contains
but
it
is
not
to
be
confused
with
this
it
surpasses
it
and
dominates
it
this
is
because
it
is
of
a
different
origin
it
is
not
a
mere
summary
of
individual
experiences
before
all
else
it
is
made
to
fulfil
the
exigencies
of
life
in
common
in
fine
the
error
of
empiricism
has
been
to
regard
the
causal
bond
as
merely
an
intellectual
construction
of
speculative
thought
and
the
product
of
a
more
or
less
methodical
generalization
now
by
itself
pure
speculation
can
give
birth
only
to
provisional
hypothetical
and
more
or
less
plausible
views
but
ones
which
must
always
be
regarded
with
suspicion
for
we
can
never
be
sure
that
some
new
observation
in
the
future
will
not
invalidate
them
an
axiom
which
the
mind
accepts
and
must
accept
without
control
and
without
reservation
could
never
come
from
this
source
only
the
necessities
of
action
and
especially
of
collective
action
can
and
must
express
themselves
in
categorical
formulæ
which
are
peremptory
and
short
and
admit
of
no
contradiction
for
collective
movements
are
possible
only
on
condition
of
being
in
concert
and
therefore
regulated
and
definite
they
do
not
allow
of
any
fumbling
the
source
of
anarchy
by
themselves
they
tend
towards
an
organization
which
when
once
established
imposes
itself
upon
individuals
and
as
action
can
not
go
beyond
intelligence
it
frequently
happens
that
the
latter
is
drawn
into
the
same
way
and
accepts
without
discussion
the
theoretical
postulates
demanded
by
action
the
imperatives
of
thought
are
probably
only
another
side
of
the
imperatives
of
action
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
moreover
that
we
have
never
dreamed
of
offering
the
preceding
observations
as
a
complete
theory
of
the
concept
of
causality
the
question
is
too
complex
to
be
resolved
thus
the
principle
of
causality
has
been
understood
differently
in
different
times
and
places
in
a
single
society
it
varies
with
the
social
environment
and
the
kingdoms
of
nature
to
which
it
is
applied
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
determine
with
sufficient
precision
the
causes
and
conditions
upon
which
it
depends
after
a
consideration
of
only
one
of
the
forms
which
it
has
presented
during
the
course
of
history
the
views
which
we
have
set
forth
should
be
regarded
as
mere
indications
which
must
be
controlled
and
completed
however
as
the
causal
law
which
we
have
been
considering
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
primitive
which
exists
and
as
it
has
played
a
considerable
part
in
the
development
of
human
thought
and
industry
it
is
a
privileged
experiment
so
we
may
presume
that
the
remarks
of
which
it
has
been
the
occasion
may
be
generalized
to
a
certain
degree
chapter
iv
the
positive
cult
or
commemorative
the
explanation
which
we
have
given
of
the
positive
rites
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
in
the
two
preceding
chapters
attributes
to
them
a
significance
which
is
above
all
moral
and
social
the
physical
efficaciousness
assigned
to
them
by
the
believer
is
the
product
of
an
interpretation
which
conceals
the
essential
reason
for
their
existence
it
is
because
they
serve
to
remake
individuals
and
groups
morally
that
they
are
believed
to
have
a
power
over
things
but
even
if
this
hypothesis
has
enabled
us
to
account
for
the
facts
we
can
not
say
that
it
has
been
demonstrated
directly
at
first
view
it
even
seems
to
conciliate
itself
rather
badly
with
the
nature
of
the
ritual
mechanisms
which
we
have
analysed
whether
they
consist
in
oblations
or
imitative
acts
the
gestures
composing
them
have
purely
material
ends
in
view
they
have
or
seem
to
have
the
sole
object
of
making
the
totemic
species
reproduce
under
these
circumstances
is
it
not
surprising
that
their
real
function
should
be
to
serve
moral
ends
it
is
true
that
their
physical
function
may
have
been
exaggerated
by
spencer
and
gillen
even
in
the
cases
where
it
is
the
most
incontestable
according
to
these
authors
each
clan
celebrates
its
intichiuma
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
a
useful
food
to
the
other
clans
and
the
whole
cult
consists
in
a
sort
of
economic
of
the
different
totemic
groups
each
works
for
the
others
but
according
to
strehlow
this
conception
of
australian
totemism
is
wholly
foreign
to
the
native
mind
if
he
says
the
members
of
one
totemic
group
set
themselves
to
multiplying
the
animals
or
plants
of
the
consecrated
species
and
seem
to
work
for
their
companions
of
other
totems
we
must
be
careful
not
to
regard
this
collaboration
as
the
fundamental
principle
of
arunta
or
loritja
totemism
the
blacks
themselves
have
never
told
me
that
this
was
the
object
of
their
ceremonies
of
course
when
i
suggested
and
explained
the
idea
to
them
they
understood
it
and
acquiesced
but
i
should
not
be
blamed
for
having
some
distrust
of
replies
gained
in
this
fashion
strehlow
also
remarks
that
this
way
of
interpreting
the
rite
is
contradicted
by
the
fact
that
the
totemic
animals
and
plants
are
not
all
edible
or
useful
some
are
good
for
nothing
some
are
even
dangerous
so
the
ceremonies
which
concern
them
could
not
have
any
such
end
in
view
when
some
one
asks
the
natives
what
the
determining
reason
for
these
ceremonies
is
concludes
our
author
they
are
unanimous
in
replying
is
because
our
ancestors
arranged
things
thus
this
is
why
we
do
thus
and
not
differently
but
in
saying
that
the
rite
is
observed
because
it
comes
from
the
ancestors
it
is
admitted
that
its
authority
is
confounded
with
the
authority
of
tradition
which
is
a
social
affair
of
the
first
order
men
celebrate
it
to
remain
faithful
to
the
past
to
keep
for
the
group
its
normal
physiognomy
and
not
because
of
the
physical
effects
which
it
may
produce
thus
the
way
in
which
the
believers
themselves
explain
them
show
the
profound
reasons
upon
which
the
rites
proceed
but
there
are
cases
when
this
aspect
of
the
ceremonies
is
immediately
apparent
i
these
may
be
observed
the
best
among
the
warramunga
among
this
people
each
clan
is
thought
to
be
descended
from
a
single
ancestor
who
after
having
been
born
in
some
determined
spot
passed
his
terrestrial
existence
in
travelling
over
the
country
in
every
direction
it
is
he
who
in
the
course
of
his
voyages
gave
to
the
land
the
form
which
it
now
has
it
is
he
who
made
the
mountains
and
plains
the
and
streams
etc
at
the
same
time
he
sowed
upon
his
route
living
germs
which
were
disengaged
from
his
body
and
after
many
successive
reincarnations
became
the
actual
members
of
the
clan
now
the
ceremony
of
the
warramunga
which
corresponds
exactly
to
the
intichiuma
of
the
arunta
has
the
object
of
commemorating
and
representing
the
mythical
history
of
this
ancestor
there
is
no
question
of
oblations
or
except
in
one
single
case
of
imitative
practices
the
rite
consists
solely
in
recollecting
the
past
and
in
a
way
making
it
present
by
means
of
a
veritable
dramatic
representation
this
word
is
the
more
exact
because
in
this
ceremony
the
officiant
is
in
no
way
considered
an
incarnation
of
the
ancestor
whom
he
represents
he
is
an
actor
playing
a
rôle
as
an
example
let
us
describe
the
intichiuma
of
the
black
snake
as
spencer
and
gillen
observed
it
an
initial
ceremony
does
not
seem
to
refer
to
the
past
at
least
the
description
of
it
which
is
given
us
gives
no
authorization
for
interpreting
it
in
this
sense
it
consists
in
running
and
leaping
on
the
part
of
two
officiants
who
are
decorated
with
designs
representing
the
black
snake
when
they
finally
fall
exhausted
on
the
ground
the
assistants
gently
pass
their
hands
over
the
emblematic
designs
with
which
the
backs
of
the
two
actors
are
covered
they
say
that
this
act
pleases
the
black
snake
it
is
only
afterwards
that
the
series
of
commemorative
ceremonies
commences
they
put
into
action
the
mythical
history
of
the
ancestor
thalaualla
from
the
moment
he
emerged
from
the
ground
up
to
his
definite
return
thither
they
follow
him
through
all
his
voyages
the
myth
says
that
in
each
of
the
localities
where
he
sojourned
he
celebrated
totemic
ceremonies
they
now
repeat
them
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
are
supposed
to
have
taken
place
originally
the
movement
which
is
acted
the
most
frequently
consists
in
twisting
the
entire
body
about
rhythmically
and
violently
this
is
because
the
ancestor
did
the
same
thing
to
make
the
germs
of
life
which
were
in
him
come
out
the
actors
have
their
bodies
covered
with
down
which
is
detached
and
flies
away
during
these
movements
this
is
a
way
of
representing
the
flight
of
these
mystic
germs
and
their
dispersion
into
space
it
will
be
remembered
that
among
the
arunta
the
scene
of
the
ceremony
is
determined
by
the
ritual
it
is
the
spot
where
the
sacred
rocks
trees
and
are
found
and
the
worshippers
must
go
there
to
celebrate
the
cult
among
the
warramunga
on
the
contrary
the
ceremonial
ground
is
arbitrarily
chosen
according
to
convenience
it
is
a
conventional
scene
however
the
original
scene
of
the
events
whose
reproduction
constitutes
the
theme
of
the
rite
is
itself
represented
by
means
of
designs
sometimes
these
designs
are
made
upon
the
very
bodies
of
the
actors
for
example
a
small
circle
coloured
red
painted
on
the
back
and
stomach
represents
a
in
other
cases
the
image
is
traced
on
the
soil
upon
a
ground
previously
soaked
and
covered
with
red
ochre
they
draw
curved
lines
made
up
of
a
series
of
white
points
which
symbolize
a
stream
or
a
mountain
this
is
a
beginning
of
decoration
in
addition
to
the
properly
religious
ceremonies
which
the
ancestor
is
believed
to
have
celebrated
long
ago
they
also
represent
simple
episodes
of
his
career
either
epic
or
comic
thus
at
a
given
moment
while
three
actors
are
on
the
scene
occupied
in
an
important
rite
another
one
hides
behind
a
bunch
of
trees
situated
at
some
distance
a
packet
of
down
is
attached
about
his
neck
which
represents
a
as
soon
as
the
principal
ceremony
is
finished
an
old
man
traces
a
line
upon
the
ground
which
is
directed
towards
the
spot
where
the
fourth
actor
is
hidden
the
others
march
behind
him
with
eyes
lowered
and
fixed
upon
this
line
as
though
following
a
trail
when
they
discover
the
man
they
assume
a
stupefied
air
and
one
of
them
beats
him
with
a
club
this
represents
an
incident
in
the
life
of
the
great
black
snake
one
day
his
son
went
hunting
caught
a
and
ate
it
without
giving
his
father
any
the
latter
followed
his
tracks
surprised
him
and
forced
him
to
disgorge
it
is
to
this
that
the
beating
at
the
end
of
the
representation
alludes
we
shall
not
relate
here
all
the
mythical
events
which
are
represented
successively
the
preceding
examples
are
sufficient
to
show
the
character
of
these
ceremonies
they
are
dramas
but
of
a
particular
variety
they
act
or
at
least
they
are
believed
to
act
upon
the
course
of
nature
when
the
commemoration
of
thalaualla
is
terminated
the
warramunga
are
convinced
that
black
snakes
can
not
fail
to
increase
and
multiply
so
these
dramas
are
rites
and
even
rites
which
by
the
nature
of
their
efficacy
are
comparable
on
every
point
to
those
which
constitute
the
intichiuma
of
the
arunta
therefore
each
is
able
to
clarify
the
other
it
is
even
more
legitimate
to
compare
them
than
if
there
were
no
break
of
continuity
between
them
not
only
is
the
end
pursued
identical
in
each
case
but
the
most
characteristic
part
of
the
warramunga
ritual
is
found
in
germ
in
the
other
in
fact
the
intichiuma
as
the
arunta
generally
perform
it
contains
within
it
a
sort
of
implicit
commemoration
the
places
where
it
is
celebrated
are
necessarily
those
which
the
ancestor
made
illustrious
the
roads
over
which
the
worshippers
pass
in
the
course
of
their
pious
pilgrimages
are
those
which
the
heroes
of
the
alcheringa
traversed
the
places
where
they
stop
to
proceed
with
the
rites
are
those
where
their
fathers
sojourned
themselves
where
they
vanished
into
the
ground
etc
so
everything
brings
their
memory
to
the
minds
of
the
assistants
moreover
to
the
manual
rites
they
frequently
add
hymns
relating
the
exploits
of
their
ancestors
if
instead
of
being
told
these
stories
are
acted
and
if
in
this
new
form
they
develop
in
such
a
way
as
to
become
an
essential
part
of
the
ceremony
then
we
have
the
ceremony
of
the
warramunga
but
even
more
can
be
said
for
on
one
side
the
arunta
intichiuma
is
already
a
sort
of
representation
the
officiant
is
one
with
the
ancestor
from
whom
he
is
descended
and
whom
he
reincarnates
the
gestures
he
makes
are
those
which
this
ancestor
made
in
the
same
circumstances
speaking
exactly
of
course
he
does
not
play
the
part
of
the
ancestral
personage
as
an
actor
might
do
it
he
is
this
personage
himself
but
it
is
true
notwithstanding
that
in
one
sense
it
is
the
hero
who
occupies
the
scene
in
order
to
accentuate
the
representative
character
of
the
rite
it
would
be
sufficient
for
the
duality
of
the
ancestor
and
the
officiant
to
become
more
marked
this
is
just
what
happens
among
the
warramunga
even
among
the
arunta
at
least
one
intichiuma
is
mentioned
in
which
certain
persons
are
charged
with
representing
ancestors
with
whom
they
have
no
relationship
of
mythical
descent
and
in
which
there
is
consequently
a
proper
dramatic
representation
this
is
the
intichiuma
of
the
emu
it
seems
that
in
this
case
also
contrarily
to
the
general
rule
among
this
people
the
theatre
of
the
ceremony
is
artificially
arranged
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
the
differences
separating
them
these
two
varieties
of
ceremony
thus
have
an
air
of
kinship
as
it
were
that
there
is
a
definite
relation
of
succession
between
them
and
that
one
is
a
transformation
of
the
other
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
resemblances
pointed
out
come
from
the
fact
that
the
two
sprang
from
the
same
source
that
is
from
the
same
original
ceremony
of
which
they
are
only
divergent
forms
we
shall
even
see
that
this
hypothesis
is
the
most
probable
one
but
even
without
taking
sides
on
this
question
what
has
already
been
said
is
enough
to
show
that
they
are
rites
of
the
same
nature
so
we
may
be
allowed
to
compare
them
and
to
use
the
one
to
enable
us
to
understand
the
other
better
now
the
peculiar
thing
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
warramunga
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
is
that
not
a
gesture
is
made
whose
object
is
to
aid
or
to
provoke
directly
the
increase
of
the
totemic
species
if
we
analyse
the
movements
made
as
well
as
the
words
spoken
we
generally
find
nothing
which
betrays
any
intention
of
this
sort
everything
is
in
representations
whose
only
object
can
be
to
render
the
mythical
past
of
the
clan
present
to
the
mind
but
the
mythology
of
a
group
is
the
system
of
beliefs
common
to
this
group
the
traditions
whose
memory
it
perpetuates
express
the
way
in
which
society
represents
man
and
the
world
it
is
a
moral
system
and
a
cosmology
as
well
as
a
history
so
the
rite
serves
and
can
serve
only
to
sustain
the
vitality
of
these
beliefs
to
keep
them
from
being
effaced
from
memory
and
in
sum
to
revivify
the
most
essential
elements
of
the
collective
consciousness
through
it
the
group
periodically
renews
the
sentiment
which
it
has
of
itself
and
of
its
unity
at
the
same
time
individuals
are
strengthened
in
their
social
natures
the
glorious
souvenirs
which
are
made
to
live
again
before
their
eyes
and
with
which
they
feel
that
they
have
a
kinship
give
them
a
feeling
of
strength
and
confidence
a
man
is
surer
of
his
faith
when
he
sees
to
how
distant
a
past
it
goes
back
and
what
great
things
it
has
inspired
this
is
the
characteristic
of
the
ceremony
which
makes
it
instructive
its
tendency
is
to
act
entirely
upon
the
mind
and
upon
it
alone
so
if
men
believe
nevertheless
that
it
acts
upon
things
and
that
it
assures
the
prosperity
of
the
species
this
can
be
only
as
a
reaction
to
the
moral
action
which
it
exercises
and
which
is
obviously
the
only
one
which
is
real
thus
the
hypothesis
which
we
have
proposed
is
verified
by
a
significant
experiment
and
this
verification
is
the
more
convincing
because
as
we
have
shown
there
is
no
difference
in
nature
between
the
ritual
system
of
the
warramunga
and
that
of
the
arunta
the
one
only
makes
more
evident
what
we
had
already
conjectured
from
the
other
ii
but
there
are
ceremonies
in
which
this
representative
and
idealistic
character
is
still
more
accentuated
in
those
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
the
dramatic
representation
did
not
exist
for
itself
it
was
only
a
means
having
a
very
material
end
in
view
namely
the
reproduction
of
the
totemic
species
but
there
are
others
which
do
not
differ
materially
from
the
preceding
ones
but
from
which
nevertheless
all
preoccupations
of
this
sort
are
absent
the
past
is
here
represented
for
the
mere
sake
of
representing
it
and
fixing
it
more
firmly
in
the
mind
while
no
determined
action
over
nature
is
expected
of
the
rite
at
least
the
physical
effects
sometimes
imputed
to
it
are
wholly
secondary
and
have
no
relation
with
the
liturgical
importance
attributed
to
it
this
is
the
case
notably
with
the
ceremonies
which
the
warramunga
celebrate
in
honour
of
the
snake
wollunqua
as
we
have
already
said
the
wollunqua
is
a
totem
of
a
very
especial
sort
it
is
not
an
animal
or
vegetable
species
but
a
unique
being
there
is
only
one
wollunqua
moreover
this
being
is
purely
mythical
the
natives
represent
it
as
a
colossal
snake
whose
length
is
such
that
when
it
rises
on
its
tail
its
head
is
lost
in
the
clouds
it
resides
they
believe
in
a
called
thapauerlu
which
is
hidden
in
the
bottom
of
a
solitary
valley
but
if
it
differs
in
certain
ways
from
the
ordinary
totems
it
has
all
their
distinctive
characteristics
nevertheless
it
serves
as
the
collective
name
and
emblem
of
a
whole
group
of
individuals
who
regard
it
as
their
common
ancestor
while
the
relations
which
they
sustain
with
this
mythical
beast
are
identical
with
those
which
the
members
of
other
totems
believe
that
they
sustain
with
the
founders
of
their
respective
clans
in
the
alcheringa
times
the
wollunqua
traversed
the
country
in
every
direction
in
the
different
localities
where
it
stopped
it
scattered
the
spiritual
principles
which
still
serve
as
the
souls
of
the
living
of
the
wollunqua
is
even
considered
as
a
sort
of
totem
the
warramunga
are
divided
into
two
phratries
called
uluuru
and
kingilli
nearly
all
the
totems
of
the
former
are
snakes
of
different
kinds
now
they
are
all
believed
to
be
descended
from
the
wollunqua
they
say
that
it
was
their
grandfather
from
this
we
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
how
the
myth
of
the
wollunqua
probably
arose
in
order
to
explain
the
presence
of
so
many
similar
totems
in
the
same
phratry
they
imagined
that
all
were
derived
from
one
and
the
same
totem
it
was
necessary
to
give
it
a
gigantic
form
so
that
in
its
very
appearance
it
might
conform
to
the
considerable
rôle
assigned
to
it
in
the
history
of
the
tribe
now
the
wollunqua
is
the
object
of
ceremonies
not
differing
in
nature
from
those
which
we
have
already
studied
they
are
representations
in
which
are
portrayed
the
principal
events
of
its
fabulous
life
they
show
it
coming
out
of
the
ground
and
passing
from
one
locality
to
another
they
represent
different
episodes
in
its
voyages
etc
spencer
and
gillen
assisted
at
fifteen
ceremonies
of
this
sort
which
took
place
between
the
of
july
and
the
of
august
all
being
linked
together
in
a
determined
order
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
veritable
cycle
in
the
details
of
the
rites
constituting
it
this
long
celebration
is
therefore
indistinct
from
the
ordinary
intichiuma
of
the
warramunga
as
is
recognized
by
the
authors
who
have
described
it
to
us
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
an
intichiuma
which
could
not
have
the
object
of
assuring
the
fecundity
of
an
animal
or
vegetable
species
for
the
wollunqua
is
a
species
all
by
itself
and
does
not
reproduce
it
exists
and
the
natives
do
not
seem
to
feel
that
it
has
need
of
a
cult
to
preserve
it
in
its
existence
these
ceremonies
not
only
seem
to
lack
the
efficacy
of
the
classic
intichiuma
but
it
even
seems
as
though
they
have
no
material
efficacy
of
any
sort
the
wollunqua
is
not
a
divinity
set
over
a
special
order
of
natural
phenomena
so
they
expect
no
definite
service
from
him
in
exchange
for
the
cult
of
course
they
say
that
if
the
ritual
prescriptions
are
badly
observed
the
wollunqua
becomes
angry
leaves
his
retreat
and
comes
to
punish
his
worshippers
for
their
negligence
and
inversely
when
everything
passes
regularly
they
are
led
to
believe
that
they
will
be
fortunate
and
that
some
happy
event
will
take
place
but
it
is
quite
evident
that
these
possible
sanctions
are
an
to
explain
the
rite
after
the
ceremony
had
been
established
it
seemed
natural
that
it
should
serve
for
something
and
that
the
omission
of
the
prescribed
observances
should
therefore
expose
one
to
grave
dangers
but
it
was
not
established
to
forestall
these
mythical
dangers
or
to
assure
particular
advantages
the
natives
moreover
have
only
the
very
haziest
ideas
of
them
when
the
whole
ceremony
is
completed
the
old
men
announce
that
if
the
wollunqua
is
pleased
he
will
send
rain
but
it
is
not
to
have
rain
that
they
go
through
with
the
celebration
they
celebrate
it
because
their
ancestors
did
because
they
are
attached
to
it
as
to
a
highly
respected
tradition
and
because
they
leave
it
with
a
feeling
of
moral
other
considerations
have
only
a
complimentary
part
they
may
serve
to
strengthen
the
worshippers
in
the
attitude
prescribed
by
the
rite
but
they
are
not
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
this
attitude
so
we
have
here
a
whole
group
of
ceremonies
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
awaken
certain
ideas
and
sentiments
to
attach
the
present
to
the
past
or
the
individual
to
the
group
not
only
are
they
unable
to
serve
useful
ends
but
the
worshippers
themselves
demand
none
this
is
still
another
proof
that
the
psychical
state
in
which
the
assembled
group
happens
to
be
constitutes
the
only
solid
and
stable
basis
of
what
we
may
call
the
ritual
mentality
the
beliefs
which
attribute
such
or
such
a
physical
efficaciousness
to
the
rites
are
wholly
accessory
and
contingent
for
they
may
be
lacking
without
causing
any
alteration
in
the
essentials
of
the
rite
thus
the
ceremonies
of
the
wollunqua
show
even
better
than
the
preceding
ones
the
fundamental
function
of
the
positive
cult
if
we
have
insisted
especially
upon
these
solemnities
it
is
because
of
their
exceptional
importance
but
there
are
others
with
exactly
the
same
character
thus
the
warramunga
have
a
totem
of
the
laughing
boy
spencer
and
gillen
say
that
the
clan
bearing
this
name
has
the
same
organization
as
the
other
totemic
groups
like
them
it
has
its
sacred
places
where
the
celebrated
ceremonies
in
the
fabulous
times
and
where
he
left
behind
him
who
became
the
men
of
the
clan
the
rites
connected
with
this
totem
are
indistinguishable
from
those
relating
to
the
animal
or
vegetable
totems
yet
it
is
evident
that
they
could
not
have
any
physical
efficaciousness
they
consist
in
a
series
of
four
ceremonies
which
repeat
one
another
more
or
less
but
which
are
intended
only
to
amuse
and
to
provoke
laughter
by
laughter
in
fine
to
maintain
the
gaiety
and
which
the
group
has
as
its
speciality
we
find
more
than
one
totem
among
the
arunta
themselves
which
has
no
other
intichiuma
we
have
seen
that
among
this
people
the
irregularities
and
depressions
of
the
land
which
mark
the
places
where
some
ancestor
sojourned
sometimes
serve
as
totems
ceremonies
are
attached
to
these
totems
which
are
manifestly
incapable
of
physical
effects
of
any
sort
they
can
consist
only
in
representations
whose
object
is
to
commemorate
the
past
and
they
can
aim
at
no
end
beyond
this
commemoration
while
they
enable
us
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
cult
better
these
ritual
representations
also
put
into
evidence
an
important
element
of
religion
this
is
the
recreative
and
esthetic
element
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
show
that
they
are
closely
akin
to
dramatic
representations
this
kinship
appears
with
still
greater
clarity
in
the
latter
ceremonies
of
which
we
have
spoken
not
only
do
they
employ
the
same
processes
as
the
real
drama
but
they
also
pursue
an
end
of
the
same
sort
being
foreign
to
all
utilitarian
ends
they
make
men
forget
the
real
world
and
transport
them
into
another
where
their
imagination
is
more
at
ease
they
distract
they
sometimes
even
go
so
far
as
to
have
the
outward
appearance
of
a
recreation
the
assistants
may
be
seen
laughing
and
amusing
themselves
openly
representative
rites
and
collective
recreations
are
even
so
close
to
one
another
that
men
pass
from
one
sort
to
the
other
without
any
break
of
continuity
the
characteristic
feature
of
the
properly
religious
ceremonies
is
that
they
must
be
celebrated
on
a
consecrated
ground
from
which
women
and
persons
are
excluded
but
there
are
others
in
which
this
religious
character
is
somewhat
effaced
though
it
has
not
disappeared
completely
they
take
place
outside
the
ceremonial
ground
which
proves
that
they
are
already
laicized
to
a
certain
degree
but
profane
persons
women
and
children
are
not
yet
admitted
to
them
so
they
are
on
the
boundary
between
the
two
domains
they
generally
deal
with
legendary
personages
but
ones
having
no
regular
place
in
the
of
the
totemic
religion
they
are
spirits
more
generally
malevolent
ones
having
relations
with
the
magicians
rather
than
the
ordinary
believers
and
sorts
of
bugbears
in
whom
men
do
not
believe
with
the
same
degree
of
seriousness
and
firmness
of
conviction
as
in
the
proper
totemic
beings
and
things
as
the
bonds
by
which
the
events
and
personages
represented
are
attached
to
the
history
of
the
tribe
relax
these
take
on
a
proportionately
more
unreal
appearance
while
the
corresponding
ceremonies
change
in
nature
thus
men
enter
into
the
domain
of
pure
fancy
and
pass
from
the
commemorative
rite
to
the
ordinary
corrobbori
a
simple
public
which
has
nothing
religious
about
it
and
in
which
all
may
take
part
indifferently
perhaps
some
of
these
representations
whose
sole
object
now
is
to
distract
are
ancient
rites
whose
character
has
been
changed
in
fact
the
distinction
between
these
two
sorts
of
ceremonies
is
so
variable
that
it
is
impossible
to
state
with
precision
to
which
of
the
two
kinds
they
belong
it
is
a
fact
that
games
and
the
principal
forms
of
art
seem
to
have
been
born
of
religion
and
that
for
a
long
time
they
retained
a
religious
character
we
now
see
what
the
reasons
for
this
are
it
is
because
the
cult
though
aimed
primarily
at
other
ends
has
also
been
a
sort
of
recreation
for
men
religion
has
not
played
this
rôle
by
hazard
or
owing
to
a
happy
chance
but
through
a
necessity
of
its
nature
though
as
we
have
established
religious
thought
is
something
very
different
from
a
system
of
fictions
still
the
realities
to
which
it
corresponds
express
themselves
religiously
only
when
religion
transfigures
them
between
society
as
it
is
objectively
and
the
sacred
things
which
express
it
symbolically
the
distance
is
considerable
it
has
been
necessary
that
the
impressions
really
felt
by
men
which
served
as
the
original
matter
of
this
construction
should
be
interpreted
elaborated
and
transformed
until
they
became
unrecognizable
so
the
world
of
religious
things
is
a
partially
imaginary
world
though
only
in
its
outward
form
and
one
which
therefore
lends
itself
more
readily
to
the
free
creations
of
the
mind
also
since
the
intellectual
forces
which
serve
to
make
it
are
intense
and
tumultuous
the
unique
task
of
expressing
the
real
with
the
aid
of
appropriate
symbols
is
not
enough
to
occupy
them
a
surplus
generally
remains
available
which
seeks
to
employ
itself
in
supplementary
and
superfluous
works
of
luxury
that
is
to
say
in
works
of
art
there
are
practices
as
well
as
beliefs
of
this
sort
the
state
of
effervescence
in
which
the
assembled
worshippers
find
themselves
must
be
translated
outwardly
by
exuberant
movements
which
are
not
easily
subjected
to
too
carefully
defined
ends
in
part
they
escape
aimlessly
they
spread
themselves
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
so
doing
and
they
take
delight
in
all
sorts
of
games
besides
in
so
far
as
the
beings
to
whom
the
cult
is
addressed
are
imaginary
they
are
not
able
to
contain
and
regulate
this
exuberance
the
pressure
of
tangible
and
resisting
realities
is
required
to
confine
activities
to
exact
and
economical
forms
therefore
one
exposes
oneself
to
grave
misunderstandings
if
in
explaining
rites
he
believes
that
each
gesture
has
a
precise
object
and
a
definite
reason
for
its
existence
there
are
some
which
serve
nothing
they
merely
answer
the
need
felt
by
worshippers
for
action
motion
gesticulation
they
are
to
be
seen
jumping
whirling
dancing
crying
and
singing
though
it
may
not
always
be
possible
to
give
a
meaning
to
all
this
agitation
therefore
religion
would
not
be
itself
if
it
did
not
give
some
place
to
the
free
combinations
of
thought
and
activity
to
play
to
art
to
all
that
recreates
the
spirit
that
has
been
fatigued
by
the
too
great
slavishness
of
daily
work
the
very
same
causes
which
called
it
into
existence
make
it
a
necessity
art
is
not
merely
an
external
ornament
with
which
the
cult
has
adorned
itself
in
order
to
dissimulate
certain
of
its
features
which
may
be
too
austere
and
too
rude
but
rather
in
itself
the
cult
is
something
æsthetic
owing
to
the
connection
which
mythology
has
with
poetry
some
have
wished
to
exclude
the
former
from
religion
the
truth
is
that
there
is
a
poetry
inherent
in
all
religion
the
representative
rites
which
have
just
been
studied
make
this
aspect
of
the
religious
life
manifest
but
there
are
scarcely
any
rites
which
do
not
present
it
to
some
degree
one
would
certainly
commit
the
gravest
error
if
he
saw
only
this
one
aspect
of
religion
or
if
he
even
exaggerated
its
importance
when
a
rite
serves
only
to
distract
it
is
no
longer
a
rite
the
moral
forces
expressed
by
religious
symbols
are
real
forces
with
which
we
must
reckon
and
with
which
we
can
not
do
what
we
will
even
when
the
cult
aims
at
producing
no
physical
effects
but
limits
itself
to
acting
on
the
mind
its
action
is
in
quite
a
different
way
from
that
of
a
pure
work
of
art
the
representations
which
it
seeks
to
awaken
and
maintain
in
our
minds
are
not
vain
images
which
correspond
to
nothing
in
reality
and
which
we
call
up
aimlessly
for
the
mere
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
appear
and
combine
before
our
eyes
they
are
as
necessary
for
the
well
working
of
our
moral
life
as
our
food
is
for
the
maintenance
of
our
physical
life
for
it
is
through
them
that
the
group
affirms
and
maintains
itself
and
we
know
the
point
to
which
this
is
indispensable
for
the
individual
so
a
rite
is
something
different
from
a
game
it
is
a
part
of
the
serious
life
but
if
its
unreal
and
imaginary
element
is
not
essential
nevertheless
it
plays
a
part
which
is
by
no
means
negligible
it
has
its
share
in
the
feeling
of
comfort
which
the
worshipper
draws
from
the
rite
performed
for
recreation
is
one
of
the
forms
of
the
moral
remaking
which
is
the
principal
object
of
the
positive
rite
after
we
have
acquitted
ourselves
of
our
ritual
duties
we
enter
into
the
profane
life
with
increased
courage
and
ardour
not
only
because
we
come
into
relations
with
a
superior
source
of
energy
but
also
because
our
forces
have
been
reinvigorated
by
living
for
a
few
moments
in
a
life
that
is
less
strained
and
freer
and
easier
hence
religion
acquires
a
charm
which
is
not
among
the
slightest
of
its
attractions
this
is
why
the
very
idea
of
a
religious
ceremony
of
some
importance
awakens
the
idea
of
a
feast
inversely
every
feast
even
when
it
has
purely
lay
origins
has
certain
characteristics
of
the
religious
ceremony
for
in
every
case
its
effect
is
to
bring
men
together
to
put
the
masses
into
movement
and
thus
to
excite
a
state
of
effervescence
and
sometimes
even
of
delirium
which
is
not
without
a
certain
kinship
with
the
religious
state
a
man
is
carried
outside
himself
and
diverted
from
his
ordinary
occupation
and
preoccupations
thus
the
same
manifestations
are
to
be
observed
in
each
case
cries
songs
music
violent
movements
dances
the
search
for
exciteants
which
raise
the
vital
level
etc
it
has
frequently
been
remarked
that
popular
feasts
lead
to
excesses
and
cause
men
to
lose
sight
of
the
distinction
separating
the
licit
from
the
illicit
there
are
also
religious
ceremonies
which
make
it
almost
necessary
to
violate
the
rules
which
are
ordinarily
the
most
respected
of
course
this
does
not
mean
that
there
is
no
way
to
distinguish
these
two
forms
of
public
activity
the
simple
the
profane
corrobbori
has
no
serious
object
while
as
a
whole
a
ritual
ceremony
always
has
an
important
end
still
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
there
is
perhaps
no
in
which
the
serious
life
does
not
have
some
echo
the
difference
consists
rather
in
the
unequal
proportions
in
which
the
two
elements
are
combined
iii
a
more
general
fact
confirms
the
views
which
precede
in
their
first
book
spencer
and
gillen
presented
the
intichiuma
as
a
perfectly
definite
ritual
entity
they
spoke
of
it
as
though
it
were
an
operation
destined
exclusively
for
the
assurance
of
the
reproduction
of
the
totemic
species
and
it
seemed
as
though
it
ought
to
lose
all
meaning
if
this
unique
function
were
set
aside
but
in
their
tribes
of
central
the
same
authors
use
a
different
language
though
perhaps
without
noticing
it
they
recognize
that
these
same
ceremonies
may
take
place
either
in
the
regular
intichiuma
or
in
the
initiation
rites
so
they
serve
equally
in
the
making
of
animals
or
plants
of
the
totemic
species
or
in
conferring
upon
novices
the
qualities
necessary
to
make
them
regular
members
of
the
society
from
this
point
of
view
the
intichiuma
takes
on
a
new
aspect
it
is
no
longer
a
distinct
ritual
mechanism
resting
upon
principles
of
its
own
but
a
particular
application
of
more
general
ceremonies
which
may
be
utilized
for
very
different
ends
for
this
reason
in
their
later
work
before
speaking
of
the
intichiuma
and
the
initiation
they
consecrate
a
special
chapter
to
the
totemic
ceremonies
in
general
making
abstraction
of
the
diverse
forms
which
they
may
take
according
to
the
ends
for
which
they
are
employed
this
fundamental
indetermination
of
the
totemic
ceremonies
was
only
indicated
by
spencer
and
gillen
and
rather
indirectly
at
that
but
it
has
now
been
confirmed
by
strehlow
in
more
explicit
terms
when
they
lead
the
young
novices
through
the
different
feasts
of
the
initiation
he
says
they
perform
before
them
a
series
of
ceremonies
which
though
reproducing
even
in
their
most
characteristic
details
the
rites
of
the
regular
cult
viz
rites
which
spencer
and
gillen
call
the
do
not
have
nevertheless
the
end
of
multiplying
the
corresponding
totem
and
causing
it
to
prosper
it
is
the
same
ceremony
which
serves
in
the
two
cases
the
name
alone
is
not
the
same
when
its
special
object
is
the
reproduction
of
the
species
they
call
it
and
it
is
only
when
it
is
a
part
of
the
process
of
initiation
that
they
give
it
the
name
intichiuma
moreover
these
two
sorts
of
ceremonies
are
distinguished
from
one
another
among
the
arunta
by
certain
secondary
characteristics
though
the
structure
of
the
rite
is
the
same
in
both
cases
still
we
know
that
the
effusions
of
blood
and
more
generally
the
oblations
characteristic
of
the
arunta
intichiuma
are
not
found
in
the
initiation
ceremonies
moreover
among
this
same
people
the
intichiuma
takes
place
at
a
spot
regularly
fixed
by
tradition
to
which
men
must
make
a
pilgrimage
while
the
scene
of
the
initiation
ceremonies
is
purely
conventional
but
when
the
intichiuma
consists
in
a
simple
dramatic
representation
as
is
the
case
among
the
warramunga
the
lack
of
distinction
between
the
two
rites
is
complete
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
they
commemorate
the
past
they
put
the
myth
into
action
they
play
and
one
can
not
play
in
two
materially
different
ways
so
according
to
the
circumstances
one
and
the
same
ceremony
serves
two
distinct
functions
it
may
even
lend
itself
to
other
uses
we
know
that
as
blood
is
a
sacred
thing
women
must
not
see
it
flow
yet
it
happens
sometimes
that
a
quarrel
breaks
out
in
their
presence
and
ends
in
the
shedding
of
blood
thus
an
infraction
of
the
ritual
is
committed
among
the
arunta
the
man
whose
blood
flowed
first
must
to
atone
for
this
fault
celebrate
a
ceremony
connected
with
the
totem
either
of
his
father
or
of
his
mother
this
ceremony
has
a
special
name
which
means
the
washing
away
of
blood
but
in
itself
it
does
not
differ
from
those
celebrated
at
the
time
of
the
initiation
or
in
the
intichiuma
it
represents
an
event
of
ancestral
history
so
it
may
serve
equally
to
initiate
to
act
upon
the
totemic
species
or
to
expiate
a
sacrilege
we
shall
see
that
a
totemic
ceremony
may
also
take
the
place
of
a
funeral
rite
mm
hubert
and
mauss
have
already
pointed
out
a
functional
ambiguity
of
this
same
sort
in
the
case
of
sacrifice
and
more
especially
in
that
of
hindu
sacrifice
they
have
shown
how
the
sacrifice
of
communion
that
of
expiation
that
of
a
vow
and
that
of
a
contract
are
only
variations
of
one
and
the
same
mechanism
we
now
see
that
the
fact
is
much
more
primitive
and
in
no
way
limited
to
the
institution
of
sacrifice
perhaps
no
rite
exists
which
does
not
present
a
similar
indetermination
the
mass
serves
for
marriages
as
for
burials
it
redeems
the
faults
of
the
dead
and
wins
the
favours
of
the
deity
for
the
living
etc
fasting
is
an
expiation
and
a
penance
but
it
is
also
a
preparation
for
communion
it
even
confers
positive
virtues
this
ambiguity
shows
that
the
real
function
of
a
rite
does
not
consist
in
the
particular
and
definite
effects
which
it
seems
to
aim
at
and
by
which
it
is
ordinarily
characterized
but
rather
in
a
general
action
which
though
always
and
everywhere
the
same
is
nevertheless
capable
of
taking
on
different
forms
according
to
the
circumstances
now
this
is
just
what
is
demanded
by
the
theory
which
we
have
proposed
if
the
real
function
of
the
cult
is
to
awaken
within
the
worshippers
a
certain
state
of
soul
composed
of
moral
force
and
confidence
and
if
the
various
effects
imputed
to
the
rites
are
due
only
to
a
secondary
and
variable
determination
of
this
fundamental
state
it
is
not
surprising
if
a
single
rite
while
keeping
the
same
composition
and
structure
seems
to
produce
various
effects
for
the
mental
dispositions
the
excitation
of
which
is
its
permanent
function
remain
the
same
in
every
case
they
depend
upon
the
fact
that
the
group
is
assembled
and
not
upon
the
special
reasons
for
which
it
is
assembled
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
interpreted
differently
according
to
the
circumstances
to
which
they
are
applied
is
it
a
physical
result
which
they
wish
to
obtain
the
confidence
they
feel
convinces
them
that
the
desired
result
is
or
will
be
obtained
by
the
means
employed
has
some
one
committed
a
fault
for
which
he
wishes
to
atone
the
same
state
of
moral
assurance
will
lead
him
to
attribute
expiatory
virtues
to
these
same
ritual
gestures
thus
the
apparent
efficacy
will
seem
to
change
while
the
real
efficacy
remains
invariable
and
the
rite
will
seem
to
fulfil
various
functions
though
in
fact
it
has
only
one
which
is
always
the
same
inversely
just
as
a
single
rite
may
serve
many
ends
so
many
rites
may
produce
the
same
effect
and
mutually
replace
one
another
to
assure
the
reproduction
of
the
totemic
species
one
may
have
recourse
equally
to
oblations
to
imitative
practices
or
to
commemorative
representations
this
aptitude
of
rites
for
substituting
themselves
for
one
another
proves
once
more
both
their
plasticity
and
the
extreme
generality
of
the
useful
action
which
they
exercise
the
essential
thing
is
that
men
are
assembled
that
sentiments
are
felt
in
common
and
expressed
in
common
acts
but
the
particular
nature
of
these
sentiments
and
acts
is
something
relatively
secondary
and
contingent
to
become
conscious
of
itself
the
group
does
not
need
to
perform
certain
acts
in
preference
to
all
others
the
necessary
thing
is
that
it
partakes
of
the
same
thought
and
the
same
action
the
visible
forms
in
which
this
communion
takes
place
matter
but
little
of
course
these
external
forms
do
not
come
by
chance
they
have
their
reasons
but
these
reasons
do
not
touch
the
essential
part
of
the
cult
so
everything
leads
us
back
to
this
same
idea
before
all
rites
are
means
by
which
the
social
group
reaffirms
itself
periodically
from
this
we
may
be
able
to
reconstruct
hypothetically
the
way
in
which
the
totemic
cult
should
have
arisen
originally
men
who
feel
themselves
united
partially
by
bonds
of
blood
but
still
more
by
a
community
of
interest
and
tradition
assemble
and
become
conscious
of
their
moral
unity
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
set
forth
they
are
led
to
represent
this
unity
in
the
form
of
a
very
special
kind
of
consubstantiality
they
think
of
themselves
as
all
participating
in
the
nature
of
some
determined
animal
under
these
circumstances
there
is
only
one
way
for
them
to
affirm
their
collective
existence
this
is
to
affirm
that
they
are
like
the
animals
of
this
species
and
to
do
so
not
only
in
the
silence
of
their
own
thoughts
but
also
by
material
acts
these
are
the
acts
which
make
up
the
cult
and
they
obviously
can
consist
only
in
movements
by
which
the
man
imitates
the
animal
with
which
he
identifies
himself
when
understood
thus
the
imitative
rites
appear
as
the
first
form
of
the
cult
it
will
be
thought
that
this
is
attributing
a
very
considerable
historical
importance
to
practices
which
at
first
view
give
the
effect
of
childish
games
but
as
we
have
shown
these
naïve
and
awkward
gestures
and
these
crude
processes
of
representation
translate
and
maintain
a
sentiment
of
pride
confidence
and
veneration
wholly
comparable
to
that
expressed
by
the
worshippers
in
the
most
idealistic
religions
when
being
assembled
they
proclaim
themselves
the
children
of
the
almighty
god
for
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
this
sentiment
is
made
up
of
the
same
impressions
of
security
and
respect
which
are
awakened
in
individual
consciousnesses
by
this
great
moral
force
which
dominates
them
and
sustains
them
and
which
is
the
collective
force
the
other
rites
which
we
have
been
studying
are
probably
only
variations
of
this
essential
rite
when
the
close
union
of
the
animal
and
men
has
once
been
admitted
men
feel
acutely
the
necessity
of
assuring
the
regular
reproduction
of
the
principal
object
of
the
cult
these
imitative
practices
which
probably
had
only
a
moral
end
at
first
thus
became
subordinated
to
utilitarian
and
material
ends
and
they
were
thought
of
as
means
of
producing
the
desired
result
but
proportionately
as
through
the
development
of
mythology
the
ancestral
hero
who
was
at
first
confused
with
the
totemic
animal
distinguished
himself
more
and
more
and
became
a
more
personal
figure
the
imitation
of
the
ancestor
was
substituted
for
the
imitation
of
the
animal
or
took
a
place
beside
it
and
then
representative
ceremonies
replaced
or
completed
the
imitative
rites
finally
to
be
surer
of
attaining
the
end
they
sought
men
felt
the
need
of
putting
into
action
all
the
means
at
their
disposal
close
at
hand
they
had
reserves
of
living
forces
accumulated
in
the
sacred
rocks
so
they
utilized
them
since
the
blood
of
the
men
was
of
the
same
nature
as
that
of
the
animal
they
used
it
for
the
same
purpose
and
shed
it
inversely
owing
to
this
same
kinship
men
used
the
flesh
of
the
animal
to
remake
their
own
substance
hence
came
the
rites
of
oblation
and
communion
but
at
bottom
all
these
different
practices
are
only
variations
of
one
and
the
same
theme
everywhere
their
basis
is
the
same
state
of
mind
interpreted
differently
according
to
the
situations
the
moments
of
history
and
the
dispositions
of
the
worshippers
chapter
v
piacular
rites
and
the
ambiguity
of
the
notion
of
sacredness
howsoever
much
they
may
differ
from
one
another
in
the
nature
of
the
gestures
they
imply
the
positive
rites
which
we
have
been
passing
under
review
have
one
common
characteristic
they
are
all
performed
in
a
state
of
confidence
joy
and
even
enthusiasm
though
the
expectation
of
a
future
and
contingent
event
is
not
without
a
certain
uncertainty
still
it
is
normal
that
the
rain
fall
when
the
season
for
it
comes
and
that
the
animal
and
vegetable
species
reproduce
regularly
experiences
have
shown
that
the
rites
generally
do
produce
the
effects
which
are
expected
of
them
and
which
are
the
reason
for
their
existence
men
celebrate
them
with
confidence
joyfully
anticipating
the
happy
event
which
they
prepare
and
announce
whatever
movements
men
perform
participate
in
this
same
state
of
mind
of
course
they
are
marked
with
the
gravity
which
a
religious
solemnity
always
supposes
but
this
gravity
excludes
neither
animation
nor
joy
these
are
all
joyful
feasts
but
there
are
sad
celebrations
as
well
whose
object
is
either
to
meet
a
calamity
or
else
merely
to
commemorate
and
deplore
it
these
rites
have
a
special
aspect
which
we
are
going
to
attempt
to
characterize
and
explain
it
is
the
more
necessary
to
study
them
by
themselves
since
they
are
going
to
reveal
a
new
aspect
of
the
religious
life
to
us
we
propose
to
call
the
ceremonies
of
this
sort
piacular
the
term
has
the
advantage
that
while
it
suggests
the
idea
of
expiation
it
also
has
a
much
more
extended
signification
every
misfortune
everything
of
evil
omen
everything
that
inspires
sentiments
of
sorrow
or
fear
necessitates
a
and
is
therefore
called
piacular
so
this
word
seems
to
be
very
well
adapted
for
designating
the
rites
which
are
celebrated
by
those
in
a
state
of
uneasiness
or
sadness
i
mourning
offers
us
a
first
and
important
example
of
piacular
rites
however
a
distinction
is
necessary
between
the
different
rites
which
go
to
make
up
mourning
some
consist
in
mere
abstentions
it
is
forbidden
to
pronounce
the
name
of
the
dead
or
to
remain
near
the
place
where
the
death
occurred
relatives
especially
the
female
ones
must
abstain
from
all
communication
with
strangers
the
ordinary
occupations
of
life
are
suspended
just
as
in
etc
all
these
practices
belong
to
the
negative
cult
and
are
explained
like
the
other
rites
of
the
same
sort
so
they
do
not
concern
us
at
present
they
are
due
to
the
fact
that
the
dead
man
is
a
sacred
being
consequently
everything
which
is
or
has
been
connected
with
him
is
by
contagion
in
a
religious
state
excluding
all
contact
with
things
from
profane
life
but
mourning
is
not
made
up
entirely
of
interdicts
which
have
to
be
observed
positive
acts
are
also
demanded
in
which
the
relatives
are
both
the
actors
and
those
acted
upon
very
frequently
these
rites
commence
as
soon
as
the
death
appears
imminent
here
is
a
scene
which
spencer
and
gillen
witnessed
among
the
warramunga
a
totemic
ceremony
had
just
been
celebrated
and
the
company
of
actors
and
spectators
was
leaving
the
consecrated
ground
when
a
piercing
cry
suddenly
came
from
the
camp
a
man
was
dying
there
at
once
the
whole
company
commenced
to
run
as
fast
as
they
could
while
most
of
them
commenced
to
howl
between
us
and
the
camp
say
these
observers
lay
a
deep
creek
and
on
the
bank
of
this
some
of
the
men
scattered
about
here
and
there
sat
down
bending
their
heads
forwards
between
their
knees
while
they
wept
and
moaned
crossing
the
creek
we
found
that
as
usual
the
men
camp
had
been
pulled
to
pieces
some
of
the
women
who
had
come
from
every
direction
were
lying
prostrate
on
the
body
while
others
were
standing
or
kneeling
around
digging
the
sharp
ends
of
into
the
crown
of
their
heads
from
which
the
blood
streamed
down
over
their
faces
while
all
the
time
they
kept
up
a
loud
continuous
wail
many
of
the
men
rushing
up
to
the
spot
threw
themselves
upon
the
body
from
which
the
women
arose
when
the
men
approached
until
in
a
few
minutes
we
could
see
nothing
but
a
struggling
mass
of
bodies
all
mixed
up
together
to
one
side
three
men
of
the
thapungarti
class
who
still
wore
their
ceremonial
decorations
sat
down
wailing
loudly
with
their
backs
towards
the
dying
man
and
in
a
minute
or
two
another
man
of
the
same
class
rushed
on
to
the
ground
yelling
and
brandishing
a
stone
knife
reaching
the
camp
he
suddenly
gashed
both
thighs
deeply
cutting
right
across
the
muscles
and
unable
to
stand
fell
down
into
the
middle
of
the
group
from
which
he
was
dragged
out
after
a
time
by
three
or
four
female
relatives
who
immediately
applied
their
mouths
to
the
gaping
wounds
while
he
lay
exhausted
on
the
ground
the
man
did
not
actually
die
until
late
in
the
evening
as
soon
as
he
had
given
up
his
last
breath
the
same
scene
was
only
this
time
the
wailing
was
still
louder
and
men
and
women
seized
by
a
veritable
frenzy
were
rushing
about
cutting
themselves
with
knives
and
sticks
the
women
battering
one
another
heads
with
fighting
clubs
no
one
attempting
to
ward
off
either
cuts
or
blows
finally
after
about
an
hour
a
torchlight
procession
started
off
across
the
plain
to
a
tree
in
whose
branches
the
body
was
left
howsoever
great
the
violence
of
these
manifestations
may
be
they
are
strictly
regulated
by
etiquette
the
individuals
who
make
bloody
incisions
in
themselves
are
designated
by
usage
they
must
have
certain
relations
of
kinship
with
the
dead
man
thus
in
the
case
observed
by
spencer
and
gillen
among
the
warramunga
those
who
slashed
their
thighs
were
the
maternal
grandfather
of
the
deceased
his
maternal
uncle
and
the
maternal
uncle
and
brother
of
his
wife
others
must
cut
their
whiskers
and
hair
and
then
smear
their
scalps
with
women
have
particularly
severe
obligations
they
must
cut
their
hair
and
cover
the
whole
body
with
in
addition
to
this
a
strict
silence
is
imposed
upon
them
during
the
whole
period
of
mourning
which
may
last
as
long
as
two
years
it
is
not
rare
among
the
warramunga
that
as
a
result
of
this
interdiction
all
the
women
of
a
camp
are
condemned
to
the
most
absolute
silence
this
becomes
so
habitual
to
them
that
even
after
the
expiration
of
the
period
of
mourning
they
voluntarily
renounce
all
spoken
language
and
prefer
to
communicate
with
gestures
in
which
by
the
way
they
acquire
a
remarkable
ability
spencer
and
gillen
knew
one
old
woman
who
had
not
spoken
for
over
years
the
ceremony
which
we
have
described
opens
a
long
series
of
rites
which
succeed
one
another
for
weeks
and
even
for
months
during
the
days
which
follow
they
are
renewed
in
various
forms
groups
of
men
and
women
sit
on
the
ground
weeping
and
lamenting
and
kissing
each
other
at
certain
moments
these
ritual
kissings
are
repeated
frequently
during
the
period
of
mourning
it
seems
as
though
men
felt
a
need
of
coming
close
together
and
communicating
most
closely
they
are
to
be
seen
holding
to
each
other
and
wound
together
so
much
as
to
make
one
single
mass
from
which
loud
groans
escape
meanwhile
the
women
commence
to
lacerate
their
heads
again
and
in
order
to
intensify
the
wounds
they
make
they
even
go
so
far
as
to
burn
them
with
the
points
of
fiery
sticks
practices
of
this
sort
are
general
in
all
australia
the
funeral
rites
that
is
the
ritual
cares
given
to
the
corpse
the
way
in
which
it
is
buried
change
with
different
tribes
and
in
a
single
tribe
they
vary
with
the
age
sex
and
social
importance
of
the
individual
but
the
real
ceremonies
of
mourning
repeat
the
same
theme
everywhere
the
variations
are
only
in
the
details
everywhere
we
find
this
same
silence
interrupted
by
groans
the
same
obligation
of
cutting
the
hair
and
beard
or
of
covering
one
head
with
or
cinders
or
perhaps
even
with
excrements
everywhere
finally
we
find
this
same
frenzy
for
beating
one
self
lacerating
one
self
and
burning
one
self
in
central
victoria
when
death
visits
a
tribe
there
is
great
weeping
and
lamentation
amongst
the
women
the
elder
portion
of
whom
lacerate
their
temples
with
their
nails
the
parents
of
the
deceased
lacerate
themselves
fearfully
especially
if
it
be
an
only
son
whose
loss
they
deplore
the
father
beats
and
cuts
his
head
with
a
tomahawk
until
he
utters
bitter
groans
the
mother
sits
by
the
fire
and
burns
her
breasts
and
abdomen
with
a
small
sometimes
the
burns
thus
inflicted
are
so
severe
as
to
cause
death
according
to
an
account
of
brough
smyth
here
is
what
happens
in
one
of
the
southern
tribes
of
the
same
state
as
the
body
is
lowered
into
the
grave
the
widow
begins
her
sad
ceremonies
she
cuts
off
her
hair
above
her
forehead
and
becoming
frantic
seizes
and
burns
her
breasts
arms
legs
and
thighs
she
seems
to
delight
in
the
torture
it
would
be
rash
and
vain
to
interrupt
her
when
exhausted
and
when
she
can
hardly
walk
she
yet
endeavours
to
kick
the
embers
of
the
fire
and
to
throw
them
about
sitting
down
she
takes
the
ashes
into
her
hands
rubs
them
into
her
wounds
and
then
scratches
her
face
the
only
part
not
touched
by
the
until
the
blood
mingles
with
the
ashes
which
partly
hide
her
cruel
wounds
in
this
plight
scratching
her
face
continually
she
utters
howls
and
lamentations
the
description
which
howitt
gives
of
the
rites
of
mourning
among
the
kurnai
is
remarkably
similar
to
these
others
after
the
body
has
been
wrapped
up
in
opossum
skins
and
put
in
a
shroud
of
bark
a
hut
is
built
in
which
the
relatives
assemble
there
they
lay
lamenting
their
loss
saying
for
instance
did
you
leave
us
now
and
then
their
grief
would
be
intensified
by
some
one
for
instance
the
wife
uttering
an
wail
spouse
is
dead
or
another
would
say
child
is
dead
all
the
others
would
then
join
in
with
the
proper
term
of
relationship
and
they
would
gash
themselves
with
sharp
stones
and
tomahawks
until
their
heads
and
bodies
streamed
with
blood
this
bitter
wailing
and
weeping
continued
all
night
sadness
is
not
the
only
sentiment
expressed
during
these
ceremonies
a
sort
of
anger
is
generally
mixed
with
it
the
relatives
feel
a
need
of
avenging
the
death
in
some
way
or
other
they
are
to
be
seen
throwing
themselves
upon
one
another
and
trying
to
wound
each
other
sometimes
the
attack
is
real
sometimes
it
is
only
pretended
there
are
even
cases
when
these
peculiar
combats
are
organized
among
the
kaitish
the
hair
of
the
deceased
passes
by
right
to
his
but
he
in
return
must
go
in
company
with
some
of
his
relatives
and
friends
and
provoke
a
quarrel
with
one
of
his
tribal
brothers
that
is
with
a
man
belonging
to
the
same
matrimonial
class
as
himself
and
one
who
might
therefore
have
married
the
daughter
of
the
dead
man
this
provocation
can
not
be
refused
and
the
two
combatants
inflict
serious
wounds
upon
each
other
shoulders
and
thighs
when
the
duel
is
terminated
the
challenger
passes
on
to
his
adversary
the
hair
which
he
had
temporarily
inherited
this
latter
then
provokes
and
fights
with
another
of
his
tribal
brothers
to
whom
the
precious
relic
is
next
transmitted
but
only
provisionally
thus
it
passes
from
hand
to
hand
and
circulates
from
group
to
group
also
something
of
these
same
sentiments
enters
into
that
sort
of
rage
with
which
each
relative
beats
himself
burns
himself
or
slashes
himself
a
sorrow
which
reaches
such
a
paroxysm
is
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
anger
one
can
not
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
resemblances
which
these
practices
present
to
those
of
the
vendetta
both
proceed
from
the
same
principle
that
death
demands
the
shedding
of
blood
the
only
difference
is
that
in
one
case
the
victims
are
the
relatives
while
in
the
other
they
are
strangers
we
do
not
have
to
treat
especially
of
the
vendetta
which
belongs
rather
to
the
study
of
juridic
institutions
but
it
should
be
pointed
out
nevertheless
how
it
is
connected
with
the
rites
of
mourning
whose
end
it
announces
in
certain
societies
the
mourning
is
terminated
by
a
ceremony
whose
effervescence
reaches
or
surpasses
that
produced
by
the
inaugural
ceremonies
among
the
arunta
this
closing
rite
is
called
spencer
and
gillen
assisted
at
two
of
these
rites
one
was
celebrated
in
honour
of
a
man
the
other
of
a
woman
here
is
the
description
they
give
of
the
latter
they
commence
by
making
some
ornaments
of
a
special
sort
called
by
the
men
and
by
the
women
with
a
kind
of
resin
they
fixed
small
animal
bones
which
had
previously
been
gathered
and
set
aside
to
locks
of
hair
furnished
by
the
relatives
of
the
dead
woman
these
are
then
attached
to
one
of
the
which
women
ordinarily
wear
and
the
feathers
of
black
cockatoos
and
parrots
are
added
to
it
when
these
preparations
are
completed
the
women
assemble
in
their
camp
they
paint
their
bodies
different
colours
according
to
their
degree
of
kinship
with
the
deceased
after
being
embraced
by
one
another
for
some
ten
minutes
while
uttering
uninterrupted
groans
they
set
out
for
the
tomb
at
a
certain
distance
they
meet
a
brother
by
blood
of
the
dead
woman
who
is
accompanied
by
some
of
his
tribal
brothers
everybody
sits
down
on
the
ground
and
the
lamentations
recommence
a
containing
the
chimurilia
is
then
presented
to
the
elder
brother
who
presses
it
against
his
stomach
they
say
that
this
is
a
way
of
lessening
his
sorrow
they
take
out
one
of
the
chimurilia
and
the
dead
woman
mother
puts
it
on
her
head
for
a
little
while
then
it
is
put
back
into
the
which
each
of
the
other
men
presses
against
his
breast
in
his
turn
finally
the
brother
puts
the
chimurilia
on
the
heads
of
two
elder
sisters
and
they
set
out
again
for
the
tomb
on
the
way
the
mother
throws
herself
on
the
ground
several
times
and
tries
to
slash
her
head
with
a
pointed
stick
every
time
the
other
women
pick
her
up
and
seem
to
take
care
that
she
does
not
hurt
herself
too
much
when
they
arrive
at
the
tomb
she
throws
herself
on
the
knoll
and
endeavours
to
destroy
it
with
her
hands
while
the
other
women
literally
dance
upon
her
the
tribal
mothers
and
aunts
sisters
of
the
dead
woman
father
follow
her
example
they
also
throw
themselves
on
the
ground
and
mutually
beat
and
tear
each
other
finally
their
bodies
are
all
streaming
with
blood
after
a
while
they
are
dragged
aside
the
elder
sisters
then
make
a
hole
in
the
earth
of
the
tomb
in
which
they
place
the
chimurilia
which
had
previously
been
torn
to
pieces
once
again
the
tribal
mothers
throw
themselves
on
the
ground
and
slash
each
other
heads
at
this
moment
the
weeping
and
wailing
of
the
women
who
were
standing
round
seemed
to
drive
them
almost
frenzied
and
the
blood
streaming
down
their
bodies
over
the
white
gave
them
a
ghastly
appearance
at
last
only
the
old
mother
was
left
crouching
alone
utterly
exhausted
and
moaning
weakly
on
the
grave
then
the
others
raised
her
up
and
rubbed
off
the
with
which
she
was
covered
this
was
the
end
of
the
ceremony
and
of
the
mourning
among
the
warramunga
the
final
rite
presents
some
rather
particular
characteristics
there
seems
to
be
no
shedding
of
blood
here
but
the
collective
effervescence
is
translated
in
another
manner
among
his
people
before
the
body
is
definitely
interred
it
is
exposed
upon
a
platform
placed
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
it
is
left
there
to
decompose
slowly
until
nothing
remains
but
the
bones
then
these
are
gathered
together
and
with
the
exception
of
the
humerus
they
are
placed
inside
an
the
humerus
is
wrapped
up
in
a
bark
box
which
is
decorated
in
different
manners
the
box
is
then
brought
to
camp
amid
the
cries
and
groans
of
the
women
during
the
following
days
they
celebrate
a
series
of
totemic
rites
concerning
the
totem
of
the
deceased
and
the
mythical
history
of
the
ancestors
from
whom
the
clan
is
descended
when
all
these
ceremonies
have
been
terminated
they
proceed
to
the
closing
rite
a
trench
one
foot
deep
and
fifteen
feet
long
is
dug
in
the
field
of
the
ceremony
a
design
representing
the
totem
of
the
deceased
and
certain
spots
where
the
ancestor
stopped
is
made
on
the
ground
a
little
distance
from
it
near
this
design
a
little
ditch
is
dug
in
the
ground
ten
decorated
men
then
advance
one
behind
another
and
with
their
hands
crossed
behind
their
heads
and
their
legs
wide
apart
they
stand
astraddle
the
trench
at
a
given
signal
the
women
run
from
the
camp
in
a
profound
silence
when
they
are
near
they
form
in
indian
file
the
last
one
holding
in
her
hands
the
box
containing
the
humerus
then
after
throwing
themselves
on
the
ground
they
advance
on
their
hands
and
knees
and
pass
all
along
the
trench
between
the
legs
of
the
men
the
scene
shows
a
state
of
great
sexual
excitement
as
soon
as
the
last
woman
has
passed
they
take
the
box
from
her
and
take
it
to
the
ditch
near
which
is
an
old
man
he
breaks
the
bone
with
a
sharp
blow
and
hurriedly
buries
it
in
the
debris
during
this
time
the
women
have
remained
at
a
distance
with
their
backs
turned
upon
the
scene
for
they
must
not
see
it
but
when
they
hear
the
blow
of
the
axe
they
flee
uttering
cries
and
groans
the
rite
is
accomplished
the
mourning
is
terminated
ii
these
rites
belong
to
a
very
different
type
from
those
which
we
have
studied
hitherto
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
important
resemblances
can
not
be
found
between
the
two
which
we
shall
have
to
note
but
the
differences
are
more
apparent
instead
of
happy
dances
songs
and
dramatic
representations
which
distract
and
relax
the
mind
they
are
tears
and
groans
and
in
a
word
the
most
varied
manifestations
of
agonized
sorrow
and
a
sort
of
mutual
pity
which
occupy
the
whole
scene
of
course
the
shedding
of
blood
also
takes
place
in
the
intichiuma
but
this
is
an
oblation
made
with
a
movement
of
pious
enthusiasm
even
though
the
motions
may
be
the
same
the
sentiments
expressed
are
different
and
even
opposed
likewise
the
ascetic
rites
certainly
imply
privations
abstinences
and
mutilations
but
ones
which
must
be
borne
with
an
impassive
firmness
and
serenity
here
on
the
contrary
dejection
cries
and
tears
are
the
rule
the
ascetic
tortures
himself
in
order
to
prove
in
his
own
eyes
and
those
of
his
fellows
that
he
is
above
suffering
during
mourning
men
injure
themselves
to
prove
that
they
suffer
by
all
these
signs
the
characteristic
traits
of
the
piacular
rites
are
to
be
recognized
but
how
are
they
to
be
explained
one
initial
fact
is
constant
mourning
is
not
the
spontaneous
expression
of
individual
emotions
if
the
relations
weep
lament
mutilate
themselves
it
is
not
because
they
feel
themselves
personally
affected
by
the
death
of
their
kinsman
of
course
it
may
be
that
in
certain
particular
cases
the
chagrin
expressed
is
really
felt
but
it
is
more
generally
the
case
that
there
is
no
connection
between
the
sentiments
felt
and
the
gestures
made
by
the
actors
in
the
rite
if
at
the
very
moment
when
the
weepers
seem
the
most
overcome
by
their
grief
some
one
speaks
to
them
of
some
temporal
interest
it
frequently
happens
that
they
change
their
features
and
tone
at
once
take
on
a
laughing
air
and
converse
in
the
gayest
fashion
imaginable
mourning
is
not
a
natural
movement
of
private
feelings
wounded
by
a
cruel
loss
it
is
a
duty
imposed
by
the
group
one
weeps
not
simply
because
he
is
sad
but
because
he
is
forced
to
weep
it
is
a
ritual
attitude
which
he
is
forced
to
adopt
out
of
respect
for
custom
but
which
is
in
a
large
measure
independent
of
his
affective
state
moreover
this
obligation
is
sanctioned
by
mythical
or
social
penalties
they
believe
for
example
that
if
a
relative
does
not
mourn
as
is
fitting
then
the
soul
of
the
departed
follows
upon
his
steps
and
kills
him
in
other
cases
society
does
not
leave
it
to
the
religious
forces
to
punish
the
negligent
it
intervenes
itself
and
reprimands
the
ritual
faults
if
a
does
not
render
to
his
the
funeral
attentions
which
are
due
him
and
if
he
does
not
make
the
prescribed
incisions
then
his
tribal
take
his
wife
away
from
him
and
give
him
another
therefore
in
order
to
square
himself
with
usage
a
man
sometimes
forces
tears
to
flow
by
artificial
means
whence
comes
this
obligation
ethnographers
and
sociologists
are
generally
satisfied
with
the
reply
which
the
natives
themselves
give
to
this
question
they
say
that
the
dead
wish
to
be
lamented
that
by
refusing
them
the
tribute
of
sorrow
which
is
their
right
men
offend
them
and
that
the
only
way
of
preventing
their
anger
is
to
conform
to
their
will
but
this
mythological
interpretation
merely
modifies
the
terms
of
the
problem
without
resolving
it
it
is
still
necessary
to
explain
why
the
dead
imperatively
reclaim
the
mourning
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
natural
for
men
to
wish
to
be
mourned
and
regretted
but
in
making
this
sentiment
explain
the
complex
system
of
rites
which
make
up
mourning
we
attribute
to
the
australian
affective
exigencies
of
which
the
civilized
man
himself
does
not
always
give
evidence
let
us
admit
as
is
not
evident
that
the
idea
of
not
being
forgotten
too
readily
is
pleasing
to
a
man
who
thinks
of
the
future
it
is
still
to
be
established
that
it
has
ever
had
enough
importance
in
the
minds
of
the
living
for
one
to
attribute
to
the
dead
a
state
of
mind
proceeding
almost
entirely
from
this
preoccupation
it
seems
especially
improbable
that
such
a
sentiment
could
obsess
and
impassion
men
who
are
seldom
accustomed
to
thinking
beyond
the
present
moment
so
far
is
it
from
being
a
fact
that
the
desire
to
survive
in
the
memory
of
those
who
are
still
alive
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
origin
of
mourning
that
we
may
even
ask
ourselves
whether
it
was
not
rather
mourning
itself
which
when
once
established
aroused
the
idea
of
and
the
taste
for
posthumous
regrets
the
classic
interpretation
appears
still
more
unsustainable
when
we
know
what
the
primitive
mourning
consists
in
it
is
not
made
up
merely
of
pious
regrets
accorded
to
him
who
no
longer
is
but
also
of
severe
abstinences
and
cruel
sacrifices
the
rite
does
not
merely
demand
that
one
think
of
the
deceased
in
a
melancholy
way
but
also
that
he
beat
himself
bruise
himself
lacerate
himself
and
burn
himself
we
have
even
seen
that
persons
in
mourning
sometimes
torture
themselves
to
such
a
degree
that
they
do
not
survive
their
wounds
what
reason
has
the
dead
man
for
imposing
such
torments
upon
them
such
a
cruelty
on
his
part
denotes
something
more
than
a
desire
not
to
be
forgotten
if
he
is
to
find
pleasure
in
seeing
his
own
suffer
it
is
necessary
that
he
hate
them
that
he
be
thirsty
for
their
blood
this
ferocity
would
undoubtedly
appear
natural
to
those
for
whom
every
spirit
is
necessarily
an
evil
and
redoubted
power
but
we
know
that
there
are
spirits
of
every
sort
how
does
it
happen
that
the
soul
of
the
dead
man
is
necessarily
an
evil
spirit
as
long
as
the
man
is
alive
he
loves
his
relatives
and
exchanges
services
with
them
is
it
not
strange
that
as
soon
as
it
is
freed
from
his
body
his
soul
should
instantly
lay
aside
its
former
sentiments
and
become
an
evil
and
tormenting
genius
it
is
a
general
rule
that
the
dead
man
retains
the
personality
of
the
living
and
that
he
has
the
same
character
the
same
hates
and
the
same
affections
so
this
metamorphosis
is
not
easily
understandable
by
itself
it
is
true
that
the
natives
admit
it
implicitly
when
they
explain
the
rite
by
the
exigencies
of
the
dead
man
but
the
question
now
before
us
is
to
know
whence
this
conception
came
far
from
being
capable
of
being
regarded
as
a
truism
it
is
as
obscure
as
the
rite
itself
and
consequently
can
not
account
for
it
finally
even
if
we
had
found
the
reasons
for
this
surprising
transformation
we
would
still
have
to
explain
why
it
is
only
temporary
for
it
does
not
last
beyond
the
period
of
mourning
after
the
rites
have
once
been
accomplished
the
dead
man
becomes
what
he
was
when
alive
an
affectionate
and
devoted
relation
he
puts
the
new
powers
which
he
receives
from
his
new
condition
at
the
service
of
his
friends
thenceforth
he
is
regarded
as
a
good
genius
always
ready
to
aid
those
whom
he
was
recently
tormenting
whence
come
these
successive
transfers
if
the
evil
sentiments
attributed
to
the
soul
come
solely
from
the
fact
that
it
is
no
longer
in
life
they
should
remain
invariable
and
if
the
mourning
is
due
to
this
it
should
be
interminable
these
mythical
explanations
express
the
idea
which
the
native
has
of
the
rite
and
not
the
rite
itself
so
we
may
set
them
aside
and
face
the
reality
which
they
translate
though
disfiguring
it
in
doing
so
if
mourning
differs
from
the
other
forms
of
the
positive
cult
there
is
one
feature
in
which
it
resembles
them
it
too
is
made
up
out
of
collective
ceremonies
which
produce
a
state
of
effervescence
among
those
who
take
part
in
them
the
sentiments
aroused
are
different
but
the
arousal
is
the
same
so
it
is
presumable
that
the
explanation
of
the
joyous
rites
is
capable
of
being
applied
to
the
sad
rites
on
condition
that
the
terms
be
transposed
when
some
one
dies
the
family
group
to
which
he
belongs
feels
itself
lessened
and
to
react
against
this
loss
it
assembles
a
common
misfortune
has
the
same
effects
as
the
approach
of
a
happy
event
collective
sentiments
are
renewed
which
then
lead
men
to
seek
one
another
and
to
assemble
together
we
have
even
seen
this
need
for
concentration
affirm
itself
with
a
particular
energy
they
embrace
one
another
put
their
arms
round
one
another
and
press
as
close
as
possible
to
one
another
but
the
affective
state
in
which
the
group
then
happens
to
be
only
reflects
the
circumstances
through
which
it
is
passing
not
only
do
the
relatives
who
are
effected
the
most
directly
bring
their
own
personal
sorrow
to
the
assembly
but
the
society
exercises
a
moral
pressure
over
its
members
to
put
their
sentiments
in
harmony
with
the
situation
to
allow
them
to
remain
indifferent
to
the
blow
which
has
fallen
upon
it
and
diminished
it
would
be
equivalent
to
proclaiming
that
it
does
not
hold
the
place
in
their
hearts
which
is
due
it
it
would
be
denying
itself
a
family
which
allows
one
of
its
members
to
die
without
being
wept
for
shows
by
that
very
fact
that
it
lacks
moral
unity
and
cohesion
it
abdicates
it
renounces
its
existence
an
individual
in
his
turn
if
he
is
strongly
attached
to
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
feels
that
he
is
morally
held
to
participating
in
its
sorrows
and
joys
not
to
be
interested
in
them
would
be
equivalent
to
breaking
the
bonds
uniting
him
to
the
group
it
would
be
renouncing
all
desire
for
it
and
contradicting
himself
when
the
christian
during
the
ceremonies
commemorating
the
passion
and
the
jew
on
the
anniversary
of
the
fall
of
jerusalem
fast
and
mortify
themselves
it
is
not
in
giving
way
to
a
sadness
which
they
feel
spontaneously
under
these
circumstances
the
internal
state
of
the
believer
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
severe
abstinences
to
which
they
submit
themselves
if
he
is
sad
it
is
primarily
because
he
consents
to
being
sad
and
he
consents
to
it
in
order
to
affirm
his
faith
the
attitude
of
the
australian
during
mourning
is
to
be
explained
in
the
same
way
if
he
weeps
and
groans
it
is
not
merely
to
express
an
individual
chagrin
it
is
to
fulfil
a
duty
of
which
the
surrounding
society
does
not
fail
to
remind
him
we
have
seen
elsewhere
how
human
sentiments
are
intensified
when
affirmed
collectively
sorrow
like
joy
becomes
exalted
and
amplified
when
leaping
from
mind
to
mind
and
therefore
expresses
itself
outwardly
in
the
form
of
exuberant
and
violent
movements
but
these
are
no
longer
expressive
of
the
joyful
agitation
which
we
observed
before
they
are
shrieks
and
cries
of
pain
each
is
carried
along
by
the
others
a
veritable
panic
of
sorrow
results
when
pain
reaches
this
degree
of
intensity
it
is
mixed
with
a
sort
of
anger
and
exasperation
one
feels
the
need
of
breaking
something
of
destroying
something
he
takes
this
out
either
upon
himself
or
others
he
beats
himself
burns
himself
wounds
himself
or
else
he
falls
upon
others
to
beat
burn
and
wound
them
thus
it
became
the
custom
to
give
one
self
up
to
the
veritable
orgies
of
tortures
during
mourning
it
seems
very
probable
that
and
have
their
origin
in
this
if
every
death
is
attributed
to
some
magic
charm
and
for
this
reason
it
is
believed
that
the
dead
man
ought
to
be
avenged
it
is
because
men
must
find
a
victim
at
any
price
upon
whom
the
collective
pain
and
anger
may
be
discharged
naturally
this
victim
is
sought
outside
the
group
a
stranger
is
a
subject
as
he
is
not
protected
by
the
sentiments
of
sympathy
inspired
by
a
relative
or
neighbour
there
is
nothing
in
him
which
subdues
and
neutralizes
the
evil
and
destructive
sentiments
aroused
by
the
death
it
is
undoubtedly
for
this
same
reason
that
women
serve
more
frequently
than
men
as
the
passive
objects
of
the
cruellest
rites
of
mourning
since
they
have
a
smaller
social
value
they
are
more
obviously
designated
as
scapegoats
we
see
that
this
explanation
of
mourning
completely
leaves
aside
all
ideas
of
souls
or
spirits
the
only
forces
which
are
really
active
are
of
a
wholly
impersonal
nature
they
are
the
emotions
aroused
in
the
group
by
the
death
of
one
of
its
members
but
the
primitive
does
not
know
the
psychical
mechanism
from
which
these
practices
result
so
when
he
tries
to
account
for
them
he
is
obliged
to
forge
a
wholly
different
explanation
all
he
knows
is
that
he
must
painfully
mortify
himself
as
every
obligation
suggests
the
notion
of
a
will
which
obliges
he
looks
about
him
to
see
whence
this
constraint
which
he
feels
may
come
now
there
is
one
moral
power
of
whose
reality
he
is
assured
and
which
seems
designated
for
this
rôle
this
is
the
soul
which
the
death
has
liberated
for
what
could
have
a
greater
interest
than
it
in
the
effects
which
its
own
death
has
on
the
living
so
they
imagine
that
if
these
latter
inflict
an
unnatural
treatment
upon
themselves
it
is
to
conform
to
its
exigencies
it
was
thus
that
the
idea
of
the
soul
must
have
intervened
at
a
later
date
into
the
mythology
of
mourning
but
also
since
it
is
thus
endowed
with
inhuman
exigencies
it
must
be
supposed
that
in
leaving
the
body
which
it
animated
the
soul
lays
aside
every
human
sentiment
hence
the
metamorphosis
which
makes
a
dreaded
enemy
out
of
the
relative
of
yesterday
this
transformation
is
not
the
origin
of
mourning
it
is
rather
its
consequence
it
translates
a
change
which
has
come
over
the
affective
state
of
the
group
men
do
not
weep
for
the
dead
because
they
fear
them
they
fear
them
because
they
weep
for
them
but
this
change
of
the
affective
state
can
only
be
a
temporary
one
for
while
the
ceremonies
of
mourning
result
from
it
they
also
put
an
end
to
it
little
by
little
they
neutralize
the
very
causes
which
have
given
rise
to
them
the
foundation
of
mourning
is
the
impression
of
a
loss
which
the
group
feels
when
it
loses
one
of
its
members
but
this
very
impression
results
in
bringing
individuals
together
in
putting
them
into
closer
relations
with
one
another
in
associating
them
all
in
the
same
mental
state
and
therefore
in
disengaging
a
sensation
of
comfort
which
compensates
the
original
since
they
weep
together
they
hold
to
one
another
and
the
group
is
not
weakened
in
spite
of
the
blow
which
has
fallen
upon
it
of
course
they
have
only
sad
emotions
in
common
but
communicating
in
sorrow
is
still
communicating
and
every
communion
of
mind
in
whatever
form
it
may
be
made
raises
the
social
vitality
the
exceptional
violence
of
the
manifestations
by
which
the
common
pain
is
necessarily
and
obligatorily
expressed
even
testifies
to
the
fact
that
at
this
moment
the
society
is
more
alive
and
active
than
ever
in
fact
whenever
the
social
sentiment
is
painfully
wounded
it
reacts
with
greater
force
than
ordinarily
one
never
holds
so
closely
to
his
family
as
when
it
has
just
suffered
this
surplus
energy
effaces
the
more
completely
the
effects
of
the
interruption
which
was
felt
at
first
and
thus
dissipates
the
feeling
of
coldness
which
death
always
brings
with
it
the
group
feels
its
strength
gradually
returning
to
it
it
begins
to
hope
and
to
live
again
presently
one
stops
mourning
and
he
does
so
owing
to
the
mourning
itself
but
as
the
idea
formed
of
the
soul
reflects
the
moral
state
of
the
society
this
idea
should
change
as
this
state
changes
when
one
is
in
the
period
of
dejection
and
agony
he
represents
the
soul
with
the
traits
of
an
evil
being
whose
sole
occupation
is
to
persecute
men
but
when
he
feels
himself
confident
and
secure
once
more
he
must
admit
that
it
has
retaken
its
former
nature
and
its
former
sentiments
of
tenderness
and
solidarity
thus
we
explain
the
very
different
ways
in
which
it
is
conceived
at
different
moments
of
its
existence
not
only
do
the
rites
of
mourning
determine
certain
of
the
secondary
characteristics
attributed
to
the
soul
but
perhaps
they
are
not
foreign
to
the
idea
that
it
survives
the
body
if
he
is
to
understand
the
practices
to
which
he
submits
on
the
death
of
a
parent
a
man
is
obliged
to
believe
that
these
are
not
an
indifferent
matter
for
the
deceased
the
shedding
of
blood
which
is
practised
so
freely
during
mourning
is
a
veritable
sacrifice
offered
to
the
dead
man
so
something
of
the
dead
man
must
survive
and
as
this
is
not
the
body
which
is
manifestly
immobile
and
decomposed
it
can
only
be
the
soul
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
say
with
any
exactness
what
part
these
considerations
have
had
in
the
origin
of
the
idea
of
immortality
but
it
is
probable
that
here
the
influence
of
the
cult
is
the
same
as
it
is
elsewhere
rites
are
more
easily
explicable
when
one
imagines
that
they
are
addressed
to
personal
beings
so
men
have
been
induced
to
extend
the
influence
of
the
mythical
personalities
in
the
religious
life
in
order
to
account
for
mourning
they
have
prolonged
the
existence
of
the
soul
beyond
the
tomb
this
is
one
more
example
of
the
way
in
which
rites
react
upon
beliefs
iii
but
death
is
not
the
only
event
which
may
disturb
a
community
men
have
many
other
occasions
for
being
sorry
and
lamenting
so
we
might
foresee
that
even
the
australians
would
know
and
practise
other
piacular
rites
besides
mourning
however
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
only
a
small
number
of
examples
are
to
be
found
in
the
accounts
of
the
observers
one
rite
of
this
sort
greatly
resembles
those
which
have
just
been
studied
it
will
be
remembered
that
among
the
arunta
each
local
group
attributes
exceptionally
important
virtues
to
its
collection
of
churinga
this
is
this
collective
palladium
upon
whose
fate
the
fate
of
the
community
itself
is
believed
to
depend
so
when
enemies
or
white
men
succeed
in
stealing
one
of
these
religious
treasures
this
loss
is
considered
a
public
calamity
this
misfortune
is
the
occasion
of
a
rite
having
all
the
characteristics
of
mourning
men
smear
their
bodies
with
white
and
remain
in
camp
weeping
and
lamenting
during
a
period
of
two
weeks
this
is
a
new
proof
that
mourning
is
determined
not
by
the
way
in
which
the
soul
of
the
dead
is
conceived
but
by
impersonal
causes
by
the
moral
state
of
the
group
in
fact
we
have
here
a
rite
which
in
its
structure
is
indistinguishable
from
the
real
mourning
but
which
is
nevertheless
independent
of
every
notion
of
spirits
or
demons
another
circumstance
which
gives
occasion
for
ceremonies
of
the
same
nature
is
the
distress
in
which
the
society
finds
itself
after
an
insufficient
harvest
the
natives
who
live
in
the
vicinity
of
lake
eyre
says
eylmann
also
seek
to
prevent
an
insufficiency
of
food
by
means
of
secret
ceremonies
but
many
of
the
ritual
practices
observed
in
this
region
are
to
be
distinguished
from
those
which
have
been
mentioned
already
it
is
not
by
symbolic
dances
by
imitative
movements
nor
dazzling
decorations
that
they
try
to
act
upon
the
religious
powers
or
the
forces
of
nature
but
by
means
of
the
suffering
which
individuals
inflict
upon
themselves
in
the
northern
territories
it
is
by
means
of
tortures
such
as
prolonged
fasts
vigils
dances
persisted
up
to
the
exhaustion
of
the
dancers
and
physical
pains
of
every
sort
that
they
attempt
to
appease
the
powers
which
are
towards
men
the
torments
to
which
the
natives
submit
themselves
for
this
purpose
sometimes
leave
them
in
such
a
state
of
exhaustion
that
they
are
unable
to
follow
the
hunt
for
some
days
to
come
these
practices
are
employed
especially
for
fighting
against
drought
this
is
because
a
scarcity
of
water
results
in
a
general
want
to
remedy
this
evil
they
have
recourse
to
violent
methods
one
which
is
frequently
used
is
the
extraction
of
a
tooth
among
the
kaitish
for
example
they
pull
out
an
incisor
from
one
man
and
hang
it
on
a
tree
among
the
dieri
the
idea
of
rain
is
closely
associated
with
that
of
bloody
incisions
made
in
the
skin
of
the
chest
and
arms
among
this
same
people
whenever
the
drought
is
very
great
the
great
council
assembles
and
summons
the
whole
tribe
it
is
really
a
tribal
event
women
are
sent
in
every
direction
to
notify
men
to
assemble
at
a
given
place
and
time
after
they
have
assembled
they
groan
and
cry
in
a
piercing
voice
about
the
miserable
state
of
the
land
and
they
beg
the
the
mythical
ancestors
to
give
them
the
power
of
making
an
abundant
rain
fall
in
the
cases
which
by
the
way
are
very
rare
when
there
has
been
an
excessive
rainfall
an
analogous
ceremony
takes
place
to
stop
it
old
men
then
enter
into
a
veritable
frenzy
while
the
cries
uttered
by
the
crowd
are
really
painful
to
hear
spencer
and
gillen
describe
under
the
name
of
intichiuma
a
ceremony
which
may
well
have
the
same
object
and
the
same
origin
as
the
preceding
ones
a
physical
torture
is
applied
to
make
an
animal
species
multiply
among
the
urabunna
there
is
one
clan
whose
totem
is
a
variety
of
snake
called
this
is
how
the
chief
of
the
clan
proceeds
to
make
sure
that
these
snakes
may
never
be
lacking
after
having
been
decorated
he
kneels
down
on
the
ground
holding
his
arms
straight
out
an
assistant
pinches
the
skin
of
his
right
arm
between
his
fingers
and
the
officiant
forces
a
pointed
bone
five
inches
long
through
the
fold
thus
formed
this
is
believed
to
produce
the
desired
result
an
analogous
rite
is
used
among
the
dieri
to
make
the
lay
the
operators
pierce
their
scrotums
in
certain
of
the
lake
eyre
tribes
men
pierce
their
ears
to
make
yams
reproduce
but
these
partial
or
total
famines
are
not
the
only
plagues
which
may
fall
upon
a
tribe
other
events
happen
more
or
less
periodically
which
menace
or
seem
to
menace
the
existence
of
the
group
this
is
the
case
for
example
with
the
southern
lights
the
kurnai
believe
that
this
is
a
fire
lighted
in
the
heavens
by
the
great
god
therefore
whenever
they
see
it
they
are
afraid
that
it
may
spread
to
the
earth
and
devour
them
so
a
great
effervescence
results
in
the
camp
they
shake
a
withered
hand
to
which
the
kurnai
attribute
various
virtues
and
utter
such
cries
as
send
it
away
do
not
let
us
be
burned
at
the
same
time
the
old
men
order
an
exchange
of
wives
which
always
indicates
a
great
excitement
the
same
sexual
licence
is
mentioned
among
the
wiimbaio
whenever
a
plague
appears
imminent
and
especially
in
times
of
an
epidemic
under
the
influence
of
these
ideas
mutilations
and
the
shedding
of
blood
are
sometimes
considered
an
efficient
means
of
curing
maladies
if
an
accident
happens
to
a
child
among
the
dieri
his
relations
beat
themselves
on
the
head
with
clubs
or
boomerangs
until
the
blood
flows
down
over
their
faces
they
believe
that
by
this
process
they
relieve
the
child
of
the
suffering
elsewhere
they
imagine
that
they
can
obtain
the
same
end
by
means
of
a
supplementary
totemic
ceremony
we
may
connect
with
these
the
example
already
given
of
a
ceremony
celebrated
specially
to
efface
the
effects
of
a
ritual
fault
of
course
there
are
neither
wounds
nor
blows
nor
physical
suffering
of
any
sort
in
these
two
latter
cases
yet
the
rite
does
not
differ
in
nature
from
the
others
the
end
sought
is
always
the
turning
aside
of
an
evil
or
the
expiation
of
a
fault
by
means
of
an
extraordinary
ritual
prestation
outside
of
mourning
such
are
the
only
cases
of
piacular
rites
which
we
have
succeeded
in
finding
in
australia
to
be
sure
it
is
probable
that
some
have
escaped
us
while
we
may
presume
equally
well
that
others
have
remained
unperceived
by
the
observers
but
if
those
discovered
up
to
the
present
are
few
in
number
it
is
probably
because
they
do
not
hold
a
large
place
in
the
cult
we
see
how
far
primitive
religions
are
from
being
the
daughters
of
agony
and
fear
from
the
fact
that
the
rites
translating
these
painful
emotions
are
relatively
rare
of
course
this
is
because
the
australian
while
leading
a
miserable
existence
as
compared
with
other
more
civilized
peoples
demands
so
little
of
life
that
he
is
easily
contented
all
that
he
asks
is
that
nature
follow
its
normal
course
that
the
seasons
succeed
one
another
regularly
that
the
rain
fall
at
the
ordinary
time
in
abundance
and
without
excess
now
great
disturbances
in
the
cosmic
order
are
always
exceptional
thus
it
is
noticeable
that
the
majority
of
the
regular
piacular
rites
examples
of
which
we
have
given
above
have
been
observed
in
the
tribes
of
the
centre
where
droughts
are
frequent
and
constitute
veritable
disasters
it
is
still
surprising
it
is
true
that
piacular
rites
specially
destined
to
expiate
sins
seem
to
be
completely
lacking
however
the
australian
like
every
other
man
must
commit
ritual
faults
which
he
has
an
interest
in
redeeming
so
we
may
ask
if
the
silence
of
the
texts
on
this
point
may
not
be
due
to
insufficient
observation
but
howsoever
few
the
facts
which
we
have
been
able
to
gather
may
be
they
are
nevertheless
instructive
when
we
study
piacular
rites
in
the
more
advanced
religions
where
the
religious
forces
are
individualized
they
appear
to
be
closely
bound
up
with
anthropomorphic
conceptions
when
the
believer
imposes
privations
upon
himself
and
submits
himself
to
austerities
it
is
in
order
to
disarm
the
malevolence
attributed
by
him
to
certain
of
the
sacred
beings
upon
whom
he
thinks
that
he
is
dependent
to
appease
their
hatred
or
anger
he
complies
with
their
exigencies
he
beats
himself
in
order
that
he
may
not
be
beaten
by
them
so
it
seems
as
though
these
practices
could
not
arise
until
after
gods
and
spirits
were
conceived
as
moral
persons
capable
of
passions
analogous
to
those
of
men
for
this
reason
robertson
smith
thought
it
possible
to
assign
a
relatively
late
date
to
expiatory
sacrifices
just
as
to
sacrificial
oblations
according
to
him
the
shedding
of
blood
which
characterizes
these
rites
was
at
first
a
simple
process
of
communion
men
poured
forth
their
blood
upon
the
altar
in
order
to
strengthen
the
bonds
uniting
them
to
their
god
the
rite
acquired
a
piacular
and
penal
character
only
when
its
original
significance
was
forgotten
and
when
the
new
idea
which
was
formed
of
sacred
beings
allowed
men
to
attribute
another
function
to
it
but
as
piacular
rites
are
met
with
even
in
the
australian
societies
it
is
impossible
to
assign
them
so
late
an
origin
moreover
all
that
we
have
observed
with
one
single
exception
are
independent
of
all
anthropomorphic
conceptions
there
is
no
question
of
either
spirits
or
gods
abstinences
and
effusions
of
blood
stop
famines
and
cure
sicknesses
directly
and
by
themselves
no
spiritual
being
introduces
his
action
between
the
rite
and
the
effect
it
is
believed
to
produce
so
mythical
personalities
intervened
only
at
a
late
date
after
the
mechanism
of
the
ritual
had
once
been
established
they
served
to
make
it
more
easily
representable
in
the
mind
but
they
are
not
conditions
of
its
existence
it
is
for
other
reasons
that
it
was
founded
it
is
to
another
cause
that
it
owes
its
efficacy
it
acts
through
the
collective
forces
which
it
puts
into
play
does
a
misfortune
which
menaces
the
group
appear
imminent
then
the
group
unites
as
in
the
case
of
mourning
and
it
is
naturally
an
impression
of
uneasiness
and
perplexity
which
dominates
the
assembled
body
now
as
always
the
pooling
of
these
sentiments
results
in
intensifying
them
by
affirming
themselves
they
exalt
and
impassion
themselves
and
attain
a
degree
of
violence
which
is
translated
by
the
corresponding
violence
of
the
gestures
which
express
them
just
as
at
the
death
of
a
relative
they
utter
terrible
cries
fly
into
a
passion
and
feel
that
they
must
tear
and
destroy
it
is
to
satisfy
this
need
that
they
beat
themselves
wound
themselves
and
make
their
blood
flow
when
emotions
have
this
vivacity
they
may
well
be
painful
but
they
are
not
depressing
on
the
contrary
they
denote
a
state
of
effervescence
which
implies
a
mobilization
of
all
our
active
forces
and
even
a
supply
of
external
energies
it
matters
little
that
this
exaltation
was
provoked
by
a
sad
event
for
it
is
real
notwithstanding
and
does
not
differ
specifically
from
what
is
observed
in
the
happy
feasts
sometimes
it
is
even
made
manifest
by
movements
of
the
same
nature
there
is
the
same
frenzy
which
seizes
the
worshippers
and
the
same
tendency
towards
sexual
debauches
a
sure
sign
of
great
nervous
robertson
smith
had
already
noticed
this
curious
influence
of
sad
rites
in
the
semitic
cults
in
evil
times
he
says
when
men
thoughts
were
habitually
sombre
they
betook
themselves
to
the
physical
excitement
of
religion
as
men
now
take
refuge
in
wine
and
so
in
general
when
an
act
of
semitic
worship
began
with
sorrow
and
lamentation
as
in
the
mourning
for
adonis
or
the
great
atoning
ceremonies
which
became
common
in
later
times
a
swift
revulsion
of
feeling
followed
and
the
gloomy
part
of
the
service
was
presently
succeeded
by
a
burst
of
hilarious
revelry
in
a
word
even
when
religious
ceremonies
have
a
disquieting
or
saddening
event
as
their
point
of
departure
they
retain
their
stimulating
power
over
the
affective
state
of
the
group
and
individuals
by
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
collective
they
raise
the
vital
tone
when
one
feels
life
within
him
whether
it
be
in
the
form
of
painful
irritation
or
happy
enthusiasm
he
does
not
believe
in
death
so
he
becomes
reassured
and
takes
courage
again
and
subjectively
everything
goes
on
as
if
the
rite
had
really
driven
off
the
danger
which
was
dreaded
this
is
how
curing
or
preventive
virtues
come
to
be
attributed
to
the
movements
which
one
makes
to
the
cries
uttered
to
the
blood
shed
and
to
the
wounds
inflicted
upon
one
self
or
others
and
as
these
different
tortures
necessarily
make
one
suffer
suffering
by
itself
is
finally
regarded
as
a
means
of
conjuring
evil
or
curing
sickness
later
when
the
majority
of
the
religious
forces
had
taken
the
form
of
moral
personalities
the
efficacy
of
these
practices
was
explained
by
imagining
that
their
object
was
to
appease
an
or
irritated
god
but
these
conceptions
only
reflect
the
rite
and
the
sentiments
it
arouses
they
are
an
interpretation
of
it
not
its
determining
cause
a
negligence
of
the
ritual
acts
in
the
same
way
it
too
is
a
menace
for
the
group
it
touches
it
in
its
moral
existence
for
it
touches
it
in
its
beliefs
but
if
the
anger
which
it
causes
is
affirmed
ostensibly
and
energetically
it
compensates
the
evil
which
it
has
caused
for
if
it
is
acutely
felt
by
all
it
is
because
the
infraction
committed
is
an
exception
and
the
common
faith
remains
entire
so
the
moral
unity
of
the
group
is
not
endangered
now
the
penalty
inflicted
as
an
expiation
is
only
a
manifestation
of
the
public
anger
the
material
proof
of
its
unanimity
so
it
really
does
have
the
healing
effect
attributed
to
it
at
bottom
the
sentiment
which
is
at
the
root
of
the
real
expiatory
rites
does
not
differ
in
nature
from
that
which
we
have
found
at
the
basis
of
the
other
piacular
rites
it
is
a
sort
of
irritated
sorrow
which
tends
to
manifest
itself
by
acts
of
destruction
sometimes
it
is
assuaged
to
the
detriment
of
him
who
feels
it
sometimes
it
is
at
the
expense
of
some
foreign
third
party
but
in
either
case
the
psychic
mechanism
is
essentially
the
same
iv
one
of
the
greatest
services
which
robertson
smith
has
rendered
to
the
science
of
religions
is
to
have
pointed
out
the
ambiguity
of
the
notion
of
sacredness
religious
forces
are
of
two
sorts
some
are
beneficent
guardians
of
the
physical
and
moral
order
dispensers
of
life
and
health
and
all
the
qualities
which
men
esteem
this
is
the
case
with
the
totemic
principle
spread
out
in
the
whole
species
the
mythical
ancestor
the
the
civilizing
heroes
and
the
tutelar
gods
of
every
kind
and
degree
it
matters
little
whether
they
are
conceived
as
distinct
personalities
or
as
diffused
energies
under
either
form
they
fulfil
the
same
function
and
affect
the
minds
of
the
believers
in
the
same
way
the
respect
which
they
inspire
is
mixed
with
love
and
gratitude
the
things
and
the
persons
which
are
normally
connected
with
them
participate
in
the
same
sentiments
and
the
same
character
these
are
holy
things
and
persons
such
are
the
spots
consecrated
to
the
cult
the
objects
which
serve
in
the
regular
rites
the
priests
the
ascetics
on
the
other
hand
there
are
evil
and
impure
powers
productive
of
disorders
causes
of
death
and
sickness
instigators
of
sacrilege
the
only
sentiments
which
men
have
for
them
are
a
fear
into
which
horror
generally
enters
such
are
the
forces
upon
which
and
by
which
the
sorcerer
acts
those
which
arise
from
corpses
or
the
menstrual
blood
those
freed
by
every
profanation
of
sacred
things
etc
the
spirits
of
the
dead
and
malign
genii
of
every
sort
are
their
personified
forms
between
these
two
categories
of
forces
and
beings
the
contrast
is
as
complete
as
possible
and
even
goes
into
the
most
radical
antagonism
the
good
and
salutary
powers
repel
to
a
distance
these
others
which
deny
and
contradict
them
therefore
the
former
are
forbidden
to
the
latter
any
contact
between
them
is
considered
the
worst
of
profanations
this
is
the
typical
form
of
those
interdicts
between
sacred
things
of
different
species
the
existence
of
which
we
have
already
pointed
out
women
during
menstruation
and
especially
at
its
beginning
are
impure
so
at
this
moment
they
are
rigorously
sequestered
men
may
have
no
relations
with
them
and
churinga
never
come
near
a
dead
man
a
sacrilegious
person
is
excluded
from
the
society
of
the
faithful
access
to
the
cult
is
forbidden
him
thus
the
whole
religious
life
gravitates
about
two
contrary
poles
between
which
there
is
the
same
opposition
as
between
the
pure
and
the
impure
the
saint
and
the
sacrilegious
the
divine
and
the
diabolic
but
while
these
two
aspects
of
the
religious
life
oppose
one
another
there
is
a
close
kinship
between
them
in
the
first
place
both
have
the
same
relation
towards
profane
beings
these
must
abstain
from
all
contact
with
impure
things
just
as
from
the
most
holy
things
the
former
are
no
less
forbidden
than
the
latter
they
are
withdrawn
from
circulation
alike
this
shows
that
they
too
are
sacred
of
course
the
sentiments
inspired
by
the
two
are
not
identical
respect
is
one
thing
disgust
and
horror
another
yet
if
the
gestures
are
to
be
the
same
in
both
cases
the
sentiments
expressed
must
not
differ
in
nature
and
in
fact
there
is
a
horror
in
religious
respect
especially
when
it
is
very
intense
while
the
fear
inspired
by
malign
powers
is
generally
not
without
a
certain
reverential
character
the
shades
by
which
these
two
attitudes
are
differentiated
are
even
so
slight
sometimes
that
it
is
not
always
easy
to
say
which
state
of
mind
the
believers
actually
happen
to
be
in
among
certain
semitic
peoples
pork
was
forbidden
but
it
was
not
always
known
exactly
whether
this
was
because
it
was
a
pure
or
an
impure
thing
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
a
very
large
number
of
alimentary
interdictions
but
there
is
more
to
be
said
it
very
frequently
happens
that
an
impure
thing
or
an
evil
power
becomes
a
holy
thing
or
a
guardian
power
without
changing
its
nature
through
a
simple
modification
of
external
circumstances
we
have
seen
how
the
soul
of
a
dead
man
which
is
a
dreaded
principle
at
first
is
transformed
into
a
protecting
genius
as
soon
as
the
mourning
is
finished
likewise
the
corpse
which
begins
by
inspiring
terror
and
aversion
is
later
regarded
as
a
venerated
relic
funeral
anthropophagy
which
is
frequently
practised
in
the
australian
societies
is
a
proof
of
this
transformation
the
totemic
animal
is
the
sacred
being
but
for
him
who
eats
its
flesh
unduly
it
is
a
cause
of
death
in
a
general
way
the
sacrilegious
person
is
merely
a
profane
one
who
has
been
infected
with
a
benevolent
religious
force
this
changes
its
nature
in
changing
its
habitat
it
defiles
rather
than
sanctifies
the
blood
issuing
from
the
genital
organs
of
a
woman
though
it
is
evidently
as
impure
as
that
of
menstruation
is
frequently
used
as
a
remedy
against
sickness
the
victim
immolated
in
expiatory
sacrifices
is
charged
with
impurities
for
they
have
concentrated
upon
it
the
sins
which
were
to
be
expiated
yet
after
it
has
been
slaughtered
its
flesh
and
blood
are
employed
for
the
most
pious
uses
on
the
contrary
though
the
communion
is
generally
a
religious
operation
whose
normal
function
is
to
consecrate
it
sometimes
produces
the
effects
of
a
sacrilege
in
certain
cases
the
persons
who
have
communicated
are
forced
to
flee
from
one
another
as
from
men
infected
with
a
plague
one
would
say
that
they
have
become
a
source
of
dangerous
contamination
for
one
another
the
sacred
bond
which
unites
them
also
separates
them
examples
of
this
sort
of
communion
are
numerous
in
australia
one
of
the
most
typical
has
been
observed
among
the
narrinyeri
and
the
neighbouring
tribes
when
an
infant
arrives
in
the
world
its
parents
carefully
preserve
its
umbilical
cord
which
is
believed
to
conceal
a
part
of
its
soul
two
persons
who
exchange
the
cords
thus
preserved
communicate
together
by
the
very
act
of
this
exchange
for
it
is
as
though
they
exchanged
their
souls
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
forbidden
to
touch
or
speak
to
or
even
to
see
one
another
it
is
just
as
though
they
were
each
an
object
of
horror
for
the
other
so
the
pure
and
the
impure
are
not
two
separate
classes
but
two
varieties
of
the
same
class
which
includes
all
sacred
things
there
are
two
sorts
of
sacredness
the
propitious
and
the
unpropitious
and
not
only
is
there
no
break
of
continuity
between
these
two
opposed
forms
but
also
one
object
may
pass
from
the
one
to
the
other
without
changing
its
nature
the
pure
is
made
out
of
the
impure
and
reciprocally
it
is
in
the
possibility
of
these
transmutations
that
the
ambiguity
of
the
sacred
consists
but
even
if
robertson
smith
did
have
an
active
sentiment
of
this
ambiguity
he
never
gave
it
an
express
explanation
he
confined
himself
to
remarking
that
as
all
religious
forces
are
indistinctly
intense
and
contagious
it
is
wise
not
to
approach
them
except
with
respectful
precautions
no
matter
what
direction
their
action
may
be
exercised
in
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
thus
account
for
the
air
of
kinship
which
they
all
present
in
spite
of
the
contrasts
which
oppose
them
otherwise
but
the
question
was
only
put
off
it
still
remains
to
be
shown
how
it
comes
that
the
powers
of
evil
have
the
same
intensity
and
contagiousness
as
the
others
in
other
words
how
does
it
happen
that
they
too
are
of
a
religious
nature
also
the
energy
and
force
of
expansion
which
they
have
in
common
do
not
enable
us
to
understand
how
in
spite
of
the
conflict
which
divides
them
they
may
be
transformed
into
one
another
or
substituted
for
each
other
in
their
respective
functions
and
how
the
pure
may
contaminate
while
the
impure
sometimes
serves
to
sanctify
the
explanation
of
piacular
rites
which
we
have
proposed
enables
us
to
reply
to
this
double
question
we
have
seen
in
fact
that
the
evil
powers
are
the
product
of
these
rites
and
symbolize
them
when
a
society
is
going
through
circumstances
which
sadden
perplex
or
irritate
it
it
exercises
a
pressure
over
its
members
to
make
them
bear
witness
by
significant
acts
to
their
sorrow
perplexity
or
anger
it
imposes
upon
them
the
duty
of
weeping
groaning
or
inflicting
wounds
upon
themselves
or
others
for
these
collective
manifestations
and
the
moral
communion
which
they
show
and
strengthen
restore
to
the
group
the
energy
which
circumstances
threaten
to
take
away
from
it
and
thus
they
enable
it
to
become
settled
this
is
the
experience
which
men
interpret
when
they
imagine
that
outside
them
there
are
evil
beings
whose
hostility
whether
constitutional
or
temporary
can
be
appeased
only
by
human
suffering
these
beings
are
nothing
other
than
collective
states
objectified
they
are
society
itself
seen
under
one
of
its
aspects
but
we
also
know
that
the
benevolent
powers
are
constituted
in
the
same
way
they
too
result
from
the
collective
life
and
express
it
they
too
represent
the
society
but
seen
from
a
very
different
attitude
to
wit
at
the
moment
when
it
confidently
affirms
itself
and
ardently
presses
on
towards
the
realization
of
the
ends
which
it
pursues
since
these
two
sorts
of
forces
have
a
common
origin
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
though
facing
in
opposite
directions
they
should
have
the
same
nature
that
they
are
equally
intense
and
contagious
and
consequently
forbidden
and
sacred
from
this
we
are
able
to
understand
how
they
change
into
one
another
since
they
reflect
the
abjective
state
in
which
the
group
happens
to
be
it
is
enough
that
this
state
change
for
their
character
to
change
after
the
mourning
is
over
the
domestic
group
is
by
the
mourning
itself
it
regains
confidence
the
painful
pressure
which
they
felt
exercised
over
them
is
relieved
they
feel
more
at
their
ease
so
it
seems
to
them
as
though
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
had
laid
aside
its
hostile
sentiments
and
become
a
benevolent
protector
the
other
transmutations
examples
of
which
we
have
cited
are
to
be
explained
in
the
same
way
as
we
have
already
shown
the
sanctity
of
a
thing
is
due
to
the
collective
sentiment
of
which
it
is
the
object
if
in
violation
of
the
interdicts
which
isolate
it
it
comes
in
contact
with
a
profane
person
then
this
same
sentiment
will
spread
contagiously
to
this
latter
and
imprint
a
special
character
upon
him
but
in
spreading
it
comes
into
a
very
different
state
from
the
one
it
was
in
at
first
offended
and
irritated
by
the
profanation
implied
in
this
abusive
and
unnatural
extension
it
becomes
aggressive
and
inclined
to
destructive
violences
it
tends
to
avenge
itself
for
the
offence
suffered
therefore
the
infected
subject
seems
to
be
filled
with
a
mighty
and
harmful
force
which
menaces
all
that
approaches
him
it
is
as
though
he
were
marked
with
a
stain
or
blemish
yet
the
cause
of
this
blemish
is
the
same
psychic
state
which
in
other
circumstances
consecrates
and
sanctifies
but
if
the
anger
thus
aroused
is
satisfied
by
an
expiatory
rite
it
subsides
alleviated
the
offended
sentiment
is
appeased
and
returns
to
its
original
state
so
it
acts
once
more
as
it
acted
in
the
beginning
instead
of
contaminating
it
sanctifies
as
it
continues
to
infect
the
object
to
which
it
is
attached
this
could
never
become
profane
and
religiously
indifferent
again
but
the
direction
of
the
religious
force
with
which
it
seems
to
be
filled
is
inverted
from
being
impure
it
has
become
pure
and
an
instrument
of
purification
in
résumé
the
two
poles
of
the
religious
life
correspond
to
the
two
opposed
states
through
which
all
social
life
passes
between
the
propitiously
sacred
and
the
unpropitiously
sacred
there
is
the
same
contrast
as
between
the
states
of
collective
and
but
since
both
are
equally
collective
there
is
between
the
mythological
constructions
symbolizing
them
an
intimate
kinship
of
nature
the
sentiments
held
in
common
vary
from
extreme
dejection
to
extreme
joy
from
painful
irritation
to
ecstatic
enthusiasm
but
in
any
case
there
is
a
communion
of
minds
and
a
mutual
comfort
resulting
from
this
communion
the
fundamental
process
is
always
the
same
only
circumstances
colour
it
differently
so
at
bottom
it
is
the
unity
and
the
diversity
of
social
life
which
make
the
simultaneous
unity
and
diversity
of
sacred
beings
and
things
this
ambiguity
moreover
is
not
peculiar
to
the
idea
of
sacredness
alone
something
of
this
characteristic
has
been
found
in
all
the
rites
which
we
have
been
studying
of
course
it
was
essential
to
distinguish
them
to
confuse
them
would
have
been
to
misunderstand
the
multiple
aspects
of
the
religious
life
but
on
the
other
hand
howsoever
different
they
may
be
there
is
no
break
of
continuity
between
them
quite
on
the
contrary
they
overlap
one
another
and
may
even
replace
each
other
mutually
we
have
already
shown
how
the
rites
of
oblation
and
communion
the
imitative
rites
and
the
commemorative
rites
frequently
fulfil
the
same
function
one
might
imagine
that
the
negative
cult
at
least
would
be
more
sharply
separated
from
the
positive
cult
yet
we
have
seen
that
the
former
may
produce
positive
effects
identical
with
those
produced
by
the
latter
the
same
results
are
obtained
by
fasts
abstinences
and
as
by
communions
oblations
and
commemorations
inversely
offerings
and
sacrifices
imply
privations
and
renunciations
of
every
sort
the
continuity
between
ascetic
and
piacular
rites
is
even
more
apparent
both
are
made
up
of
sufferings
accepted
or
undergone
to
which
an
analogous
efficacy
is
attributed
thus
the
practices
like
the
beliefs
are
not
arranged
in
two
separate
classes
howsoever
complex
the
outward
manifestations
of
the
religious
life
may
be
at
bottom
it
is
one
and
simple
it
responds
everywhere
to
one
and
the
same
need
and
is
everywhere
derived
from
one
and
the
same
mental
state
in
all
its
forms
its
object
is
to
raise
man
above
himself
and
to
make
him
lead
a
life
superior
to
that
which
he
would
lead
if
he
followed
only
his
own
individual
whims
beliefs
express
this
life
in
representations
rites
organize
it
and
regulate
its
working
conclusion
at
the
beginning
of
this
work
we
announced
that
the
religion
whose
study
we
were
taking
up
contained
within
it
the
most
characteristic
elements
of
the
religious
life
the
exactness
of
this
proposition
may
now
be
verified
howsoever
simple
the
system
which
we
have
studied
may
be
we
have
found
within
it
all
the
great
ideas
and
the
principal
ritual
attitudes
which
are
at
the
basis
of
even
the
most
advanced
religions
the
division
of
things
into
sacred
and
profane
the
notions
of
the
soul
of
spirits
of
mythical
personalities
and
of
a
national
and
even
international
divinity
a
negative
cult
with
ascetic
practices
which
are
its
exaggerated
form
rites
of
oblation
and
communion
imitative
rites
commemorative
rites
and
expiatory
rites
nothing
essential
is
lacking
we
are
thus
in
a
position
to
hope
that
the
results
at
which
we
have
arrived
are
not
peculiar
to
totemism
alone
but
can
aid
us
in
an
understanding
of
what
religion
in
general
is
it
may
be
objected
that
one
single
religion
whatever
its
field
of
extension
may
be
is
too
narrow
a
base
for
such
an
induction
we
have
not
dreamed
for
a
moment
of
ignoring
the
fact
that
an
extended
verification
may
add
to
the
authority
of
a
theory
but
it
is
equally
true
that
when
a
law
has
been
proven
by
one
experiment
this
proof
is
valid
universally
if
in
one
single
case
a
scientist
succeeded
in
finding
out
the
secret
of
the
life
of
even
the
most
protoplasmic
creature
that
can
be
imagined
the
truths
thus
obtained
would
be
applicable
to
all
living
beings
even
the
most
advanced
then
if
in
our
studies
of
these
very
humble
societies
we
have
really
succeeded
in
discovering
some
of
the
elements
out
of
which
the
most
fundamental
religious
notions
are
made
up
there
is
no
reason
for
not
extending
the
most
general
results
of
our
researches
to
other
religions
in
fact
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
same
effect
may
be
due
now
to
one
cause
now
to
another
according
to
the
circumstances
unless
the
two
causes
are
at
bottom
only
one
a
single
idea
can
not
express
one
reality
here
and
another
one
there
unless
the
duality
is
only
apparent
if
among
certain
peoples
the
ideas
of
sacredness
the
soul
and
god
are
to
be
explained
sociologically
it
should
be
presumed
scientifically
that
in
principle
the
same
explanation
is
valid
for
all
the
peoples
among
whom
these
same
ideas
are
found
with
the
same
essential
characteristics
therefore
supposing
that
we
have
not
been
deceived
certain
at
least
of
our
conclusions
can
be
legitimately
generalized
the
moment
has
come
to
disengage
these
and
an
induction
of
this
sort
having
at
its
foundation
a
clearly
defined
experiment
is
less
adventurous
than
many
summary
generalizations
which
while
attempting
to
reach
the
essence
of
religion
at
once
without
resting
upon
the
careful
analysis
of
any
religion
in
particular
greatly
risk
losing
themselves
in
space
i
the
theorists
who
have
undertaken
to
explain
religion
in
rational
terms
have
generally
seen
in
it
before
all
else
a
system
of
ideas
corresponding
to
some
determined
object
this
object
has
been
conceived
in
a
multitude
of
ways
nature
the
infinite
the
unknowable
the
ideal
etc
but
these
differences
matter
but
little
in
any
case
it
was
the
conceptions
and
beliefs
which
were
considered
as
the
essential
elements
of
religion
as
for
the
rites
from
this
point
of
view
they
appear
to
be
only
an
external
translation
contingent
and
material
of
these
internal
states
which
alone
pass
as
having
any
intrinsic
value
this
conception
is
so
commonly
held
that
generally
the
disputes
of
which
religion
is
the
theme
turn
about
the
question
whether
it
can
conciliate
itself
with
science
or
not
that
is
to
say
whether
or
not
there
is
a
place
beside
our
scientific
knowledge
for
another
form
of
thought
which
would
be
specifically
religious
but
the
believers
the
men
who
lead
the
religious
life
and
have
a
direct
sensation
of
what
it
really
is
object
to
this
way
of
regarding
it
saying
that
it
does
not
correspond
to
their
daily
experience
in
fact
they
feel
that
the
real
function
of
religion
is
not
to
make
us
think
to
enrich
our
knowledge
nor
to
add
to
the
conceptions
which
we
owe
to
science
others
of
another
origin
and
another
character
but
rather
it
is
to
make
us
act
to
aid
us
to
live
the
believer
who
has
communicated
with
his
god
is
not
merely
a
man
who
sees
new
truths
of
which
the
unbeliever
is
ignorant
he
is
a
man
who
is
he
feels
within
him
more
force
either
to
endure
the
trials
of
existence
or
to
conquer
them
it
is
as
though
he
were
raised
above
the
miseries
of
the
world
because
he
is
raised
above
his
condition
as
a
mere
man
he
believes
that
he
is
saved
from
evil
under
whatever
form
he
may
conceive
this
evil
the
first
article
in
every
creed
is
the
belief
in
salvation
by
faith
but
it
is
hard
to
see
how
a
mere
idea
could
have
this
efficacy
an
idea
is
in
reality
only
a
part
of
ourselves
then
how
could
it
confer
upon
us
powers
superior
to
those
which
we
have
of
our
own
nature
howsoever
rich
it
might
be
in
affective
virtues
it
could
add
nothing
to
our
natural
vitality
for
it
could
only
release
the
motive
powers
which
are
within
us
neither
creating
them
nor
increasing
them
from
the
mere
fact
that
we
consider
an
object
worthy
of
being
loved
and
sought
after
it
does
not
follow
that
we
feel
ourselves
stronger
afterwards
it
is
also
necessary
that
this
object
set
free
energies
superior
to
these
which
we
ordinarily
have
at
our
command
and
also
that
we
have
some
means
of
making
these
enter
into
us
and
unite
themselves
to
our
interior
lives
now
for
that
it
is
not
enough
that
we
think
of
them
it
is
also
indispensable
that
we
place
ourselves
within
their
sphere
of
action
and
that
we
set
ourselves
where
we
may
best
feel
their
influence
in
a
word
it
is
necessary
that
we
act
and
that
we
repeat
the
acts
thus
necessary
every
time
we
feel
the
need
of
renewing
their
effects
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
readily
seen
how
that
group
of
regularly
repeated
acts
which
form
the
cult
get
their
importance
in
fact
whoever
has
really
practised
a
religion
knows
very
well
that
it
is
the
cult
which
gives
rise
to
these
impressions
of
joy
of
interior
peace
of
serenity
of
enthusiasm
which
are
for
the
believer
an
experimental
proof
of
his
beliefs
the
cult
is
not
simply
a
system
of
signs
by
which
the
faith
is
outwardly
translated
it
is
a
collection
of
the
means
by
which
this
is
created
and
recreated
periodically
whether
it
consists
in
material
acts
or
mental
operations
it
is
always
this
which
is
efficacious
our
entire
study
rests
upon
this
postulate
that
the
unanimous
sentiment
of
the
believers
of
all
times
can
not
be
purely
illusory
together
with
a
recent
apologist
of
the
faith
we
admit
that
these
religious
beliefs
rest
upon
a
specific
experience
whose
demonstrative
value
is
in
one
sense
not
one
bit
inferior
to
that
of
scientific
experiments
though
different
from
them
we
too
think
that
a
tree
is
known
by
its
fruits
and
that
fertility
is
the
best
proof
of
what
the
roots
are
worth
but
from
the
fact
that
a
religious
experience
if
we
choose
to
call
it
this
does
exist
and
that
it
has
a
certain
foundation
and
by
the
way
is
there
any
experience
which
has
none
it
does
not
follow
that
the
reality
which
is
its
foundation
conforms
objectively
to
the
idea
which
believers
have
of
it
the
very
fact
that
the
fashion
in
which
it
has
been
conceived
has
varied
infinitely
in
different
times
is
enough
to
prove
that
none
of
these
conceptions
express
it
adequately
if
a
scientist
states
it
as
an
axiom
that
the
sensations
of
heat
and
light
which
we
feel
correspond
to
some
objective
cause
he
does
not
conclude
that
this
is
what
it
appears
to
the
senses
to
be
likewise
even
if
the
impressions
which
the
faithful
feel
are
not
imaginary
still
they
are
in
no
way
privileged
intuitions
there
is
no
reason
for
believing
that
they
inform
us
better
upon
the
nature
of
their
object
than
do
ordinary
sensations
upon
the
nature
of
bodies
and
their
properties
in
order
to
discover
what
this
object
consists
of
we
must
submit
them
to
an
examination
and
elaboration
analogous
to
that
which
has
substituted
for
the
sensuous
idea
of
the
world
another
which
is
scientific
and
conceptual
this
is
precisely
what
we
have
tried
to
do
and
we
have
seen
that
this
reality
which
mythologies
have
represented
under
so
many
different
forms
but
which
is
the
universal
and
eternal
objective
cause
of
these
sensations
out
of
which
religious
experience
is
made
is
society
we
have
shown
what
moral
forces
it
develops
and
how
it
awakens
this
sentiment
of
a
refuge
of
a
shield
and
of
a
guardian
support
which
attaches
the
believer
to
his
cult
it
is
that
which
raises
him
outside
himself
it
is
even
that
which
made
him
for
that
which
makes
a
man
is
the
totality
of
the
intellectual
property
which
constitutes
civilization
and
civilization
is
the
work
of
society
thus
is
explained
the
preponderating
rôle
of
the
cult
in
all
religions
whichever
they
may
be
this
is
because
society
can
not
make
its
influence
felt
unless
it
is
in
action
and
it
is
not
in
action
unless
the
individuals
who
compose
it
are
assembled
together
and
act
in
common
it
is
by
common
action
that
it
takes
consciousness
of
itself
and
realizes
its
position
it
is
before
all
else
an
active
the
collective
ideas
and
sentiments
are
even
possible
only
owing
to
these
exterior
movements
which
symbolize
them
as
we
have
established
then
it
is
action
which
dominates
the
religious
life
because
of
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
society
which
is
its
source
in
addition
to
all
the
reasons
which
have
been
given
to
justify
this
conception
a
final
one
may
be
added
here
which
is
the
result
of
our
whole
work
as
we
have
progressed
we
have
established
the
fact
that
the
fundamental
categories
of
thought
and
consequently
of
science
are
of
religious
origin
we
have
seen
that
the
same
is
true
for
magic
and
consequently
for
the
different
processes
which
have
issued
from
it
on
the
other
hand
it
has
long
been
known
that
up
until
a
relatively
advanced
moment
of
evolution
moral
and
legal
rules
have
been
indistinguishable
from
ritual
prescriptions
in
summing
up
then
it
may
be
said
that
nearly
all
the
great
social
institutions
have
been
born
in
religion
now
in
order
that
these
principal
aspects
of
the
collective
life
may
have
commenced
by
being
only
varied
aspects
of
the
religious
life
it
is
obviously
necessary
that
the
religious
life
be
the
eminent
form
and
as
it
were
the
concentrated
expression
of
the
whole
collective
life
if
religion
has
given
birth
to
all
that
is
essential
in
society
it
is
because
the
idea
of
society
is
the
soul
of
religion
religious
forces
are
therefore
human
forces
moral
forces
it
is
true
that
since
collective
sentiments
can
become
conscious
of
themselves
only
by
fixing
themselves
upon
external
objects
they
have
not
been
able
to
take
form
without
adopting
some
of
their
characteristics
from
other
things
they
have
thus
acquired
a
sort
of
physical
nature
in
this
way
they
have
come
to
mix
themselves
with
the
life
of
the
material
world
and
then
have
considered
themselves
capable
of
explaining
what
passes
there
but
when
they
are
considered
only
from
this
point
of
view
and
in
this
rôle
only
their
most
superficial
aspect
is
seen
in
reality
the
essential
elements
of
which
these
collective
sentiments
are
made
have
been
borrowed
by
the
understanding
it
ordinarily
seems
that
they
should
have
a
human
character
only
when
they
are
conceived
under
human
forms
but
even
the
most
impersonal
and
the
most
anonymous
are
nothing
else
than
objectified
sentiments
it
is
only
by
regarding
religion
from
this
angle
that
it
is
possible
to
see
its
real
significance
if
we
stick
closely
to
appearances
rites
often
give
the
effect
of
purely
manual
operations
they
are
anointings
washings
meals
to
consecrate
something
it
is
put
in
contact
with
a
source
of
religious
energy
just
as
a
body
is
put
in
contact
with
a
source
of
heat
or
electricity
to
warm
or
electrize
it
the
two
processes
employed
are
not
essentially
different
thus
understood
religious
technique
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
mystic
mechanics
but
these
material
man
oe
uvres
are
only
the
external
envelope
under
which
the
mental
operations
are
hidden
finally
there
is
no
question
of
exercising
a
physical
constraint
upon
blind
and
incidentally
imaginary
forces
but
rather
of
reaching
individual
consciousnesses
of
giving
them
a
direction
and
of
disciplining
them
it
is
sometimes
said
that
inferior
religions
are
materialistic
such
an
expression
is
inexact
all
religions
even
the
crudest
are
in
a
sense
spiritualistic
for
the
powers
they
put
in
play
are
before
all
spiritual
and
also
their
principal
object
is
to
act
upon
the
moral
life
thus
it
is
seen
that
whatever
has
been
done
in
the
name
of
religion
can
not
have
been
done
in
vain
for
it
is
necessarily
the
society
that
did
it
and
it
is
humanity
that
has
reaped
the
fruits
but
it
is
said
what
society
is
it
that
has
thus
made
the
basis
of
religion
is
it
the
real
society
such
as
it
is
and
acts
before
our
very
eyes
with
the
legal
and
moral
organization
which
it
has
laboriously
fashioned
during
the
course
of
history
this
is
full
of
defects
and
imperfections
in
it
evil
goes
beside
the
good
injustice
often
reigns
supreme
and
the
truth
is
often
obscured
by
error
how
could
anything
so
crudely
organized
inspire
the
sentiments
of
love
the
ardent
enthusiasm
and
the
spirit
of
abnegation
which
all
religions
claim
of
their
followers
these
perfect
beings
which
are
gods
could
not
have
taken
their
traits
from
so
mediocre
and
sometimes
even
so
base
a
reality
but
on
the
other
hand
does
someone
think
of
a
perfect
society
where
justice
and
truth
would
be
sovereign
and
from
which
evil
in
all
its
forms
would
be
banished
for
ever
no
one
would
deny
that
this
is
in
close
relations
with
the
religious
sentiment
for
they
would
say
it
is
towards
the
realization
of
this
that
all
religions
strive
but
that
society
is
not
an
empirical
fact
definite
and
observable
it
is
a
fancy
a
dream
with
which
men
have
lightened
their
sufferings
but
in
which
they
have
never
really
lived
it
is
merely
an
idea
which
comes
to
express
our
more
or
less
obscure
aspirations
towards
the
good
the
beautiful
and
the
ideal
now
these
aspirations
have
their
roots
in
us
they
come
from
the
very
depths
of
our
being
then
there
is
nothing
outside
of
us
which
can
account
for
them
moreover
they
are
already
religious
in
themselves
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
ideal
society
presupposes
religion
far
from
being
able
to
explain
it
but
in
the
first
place
things
are
arbitrarily
simplified
when
religion
is
seen
only
on
its
idealistic
side
in
its
way
it
is
realistic
there
is
no
physical
or
moral
ugliness
there
are
no
vices
or
evils
which
do
not
have
a
special
divinity
there
are
gods
of
theft
and
trickery
of
lust
and
war
of
sickness
and
of
death
christianity
itself
howsoever
high
the
idea
which
it
has
made
of
the
divinity
may
be
has
been
obliged
to
give
the
spirit
of
evil
a
place
in
its
mythology
satan
is
an
essential
piece
of
the
christian
system
even
if
he
is
an
impure
being
he
is
not
a
profane
one
the
is
a
god
inferior
and
subordinated
it
is
true
but
nevertheless
endowed
with
extended
powers
he
is
even
the
object
of
rites
at
least
of
negative
ones
thus
religion
far
from
ignoring
the
real
society
and
making
abstraction
of
it
is
in
its
image
it
reflects
all
its
aspects
even
the
most
vulgar
and
the
most
repulsive
all
is
to
be
found
there
and
if
in
the
majority
of
cases
we
see
the
good
victorious
over
evil
life
over
death
the
powers
of
light
over
the
powers
of
darkness
it
is
because
reality
is
not
otherwise
if
the
relation
between
these
two
contrary
forces
were
reversed
life
would
be
impossible
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
maintains
itself
and
even
tends
to
develop
but
if
in
the
midst
of
these
mythologies
and
theologies
we
see
reality
clearly
appearing
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
it
is
found
there
only
in
an
enlarged
transformed
and
idealized
form
in
this
respect
the
most
primitive
religions
do
not
differ
from
the
most
recent
and
the
most
refined
for
example
we
have
seen
how
the
arunta
place
at
the
beginning
of
time
a
mythical
society
whose
organization
exactly
reproduces
that
which
still
exists
it
includes
the
same
clans
and
phratries
it
is
under
the
same
matrimonial
rules
and
it
practises
the
same
rites
but
the
personages
who
compose
it
are
ideal
beings
gifted
with
powers
and
virtues
to
which
common
mortals
can
not
pretend
their
nature
is
not
only
higher
but
it
is
different
since
it
is
at
once
animal
and
human
the
evil
powers
there
undergo
a
similar
metamorphosis
evil
itself
is
as
it
were
made
sublime
and
idealized
the
question
now
raises
itself
of
whence
this
idealization
comes
some
reply
that
men
have
a
natural
faculty
for
idealizing
that
is
to
say
of
substituting
for
the
real
world
another
different
one
to
which
they
transport
themselves
by
thought
but
that
is
merely
changing
the
terms
of
the
problem
it
is
not
resolving
it
or
even
advancing
it
this
systematic
idealization
is
an
essential
characteristic
of
religions
explaining
them
by
an
innate
power
of
idealization
is
simply
replacing
one
word
by
another
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
first
it
is
as
if
they
said
that
men
have
made
religions
because
they
have
a
religious
nature
animals
know
only
one
world
the
one
which
they
perceive
by
experience
internal
as
well
as
external
men
alone
have
the
faculty
of
conceiving
the
ideal
of
adding
something
to
the
real
now
where
does
this
singular
privilege
come
from
before
making
it
an
initial
fact
or
a
mysterious
virtue
which
escapes
science
we
must
be
sure
that
it
does
not
depend
upon
empirically
determinable
conditions
the
explanation
of
religion
which
we
have
proposed
has
precisely
this
advantage
that
it
gives
an
answer
to
this
question
for
our
definition
of
the
sacred
is
that
it
is
something
added
to
and
above
the
real
now
the
ideal
answers
to
this
same
definition
we
can
not
explain
one
without
explaining
the
other
in
fact
we
have
seen
that
if
collective
life
awakens
religious
thought
on
reaching
a
certain
degree
of
intensity
it
is
because
it
brings
about
a
state
of
effervescence
which
changes
the
conditions
of
psychic
activity
vital
energies
are
passions
more
active
sensations
stronger
there
are
even
some
which
are
produced
only
at
this
moment
a
man
does
not
recognize
himself
he
feels
himself
transformed
and
consequently
he
transforms
the
environment
which
surrounds
him
in
order
to
account
for
the
very
particular
impressions
which
he
receives
he
attributes
to
the
things
with
which
he
is
in
most
direct
contact
properties
which
they
have
not
exceptional
powers
and
virtues
which
the
objects
of
experience
do
not
possess
in
a
word
above
the
real
world
where
his
profane
life
passes
he
has
placed
another
which
in
one
sense
does
not
exist
except
in
thought
but
to
which
he
attributes
a
higher
sort
of
dignity
than
to
the
first
thus
from
a
double
point
of
view
it
is
an
ideal
world
the
formation
of
the
ideal
world
is
therefore
not
an
irreducible
fact
which
escapes
science
it
depends
upon
conditions
which
observation
can
touch
it
is
a
natural
product
of
social
life
for
a
society
to
become
conscious
of
itself
and
maintain
at
the
necessary
degree
of
intensity
the
sentiments
which
it
thus
attains
it
must
assemble
and
concentrate
itself
now
this
concentration
brings
about
an
exaltation
of
the
mental
life
which
takes
form
in
a
group
of
ideal
conceptions
where
is
portrayed
the
new
life
thus
awakened
they
correspond
to
this
new
set
of
psychical
forces
which
is
added
to
those
which
we
have
at
our
disposition
for
the
daily
tasks
of
existence
a
society
can
neither
create
itself
nor
recreate
itself
without
at
the
same
time
creating
an
ideal
this
creation
is
not
a
sort
of
work
of
supererogation
for
it
by
which
it
would
complete
itself
being
already
formed
it
is
the
act
by
which
it
is
periodically
made
and
remade
therefore
when
some
oppose
the
ideal
society
to
the
real
society
like
two
antagonists
which
would
lead
us
in
opposite
directions
they
materialize
and
oppose
abstractions
the
ideal
society
is
not
outside
of
the
real
society
it
is
a
part
of
it
far
from
being
divided
between
them
as
between
two
poles
which
mutually
repel
each
other
we
can
not
hold
to
one
without
holding
to
the
other
for
a
society
is
not
made
up
merely
of
the
mass
of
individuals
who
compose
it
the
ground
which
they
occupy
the
things
which
they
use
and
the
movements
which
they
perform
but
above
all
is
the
idea
which
it
forms
of
itself
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
it
hesitates
over
the
manner
in
which
it
ought
to
conceive
itself
it
feels
itself
drawn
in
divergent
directions
but
these
conflicts
which
break
forth
are
not
between
the
ideal
and
reality
but
between
two
different
ideals
that
of
yesterday
and
that
of
that
which
has
the
authority
of
tradition
and
that
which
has
the
hope
of
the
future
there
is
surely
a
place
for
investigating
whence
these
ideals
evolve
but
whatever
solution
may
be
given
to
this
problem
it
still
remains
that
all
passes
in
the
world
of
the
ideal
thus
the
collective
ideal
which
religion
expresses
is
far
from
being
due
to
a
vague
innate
power
of
the
individual
but
it
is
rather
at
the
school
of
collective
life
that
the
individual
has
learned
to
idealize
it
is
in
assimilating
the
ideals
elaborated
by
society
that
he
has
become
capable
of
conceiving
the
ideal
it
is
society
which
by
leading
him
within
its
sphere
of
action
has
made
him
acquire
the
need
of
raising
himself
above
the
world
of
experience
and
has
at
the
same
time
furnished
him
with
the
means
of
conceiving
another
for
society
has
constructed
this
new
world
in
constructing
itself
since
it
is
society
which
this
expresses
thus
both
with
the
individual
and
in
the
group
the
faculty
of
idealizing
has
nothing
mysterious
about
it
it
is
not
a
sort
of
luxury
which
a
man
could
get
along
without
but
a
condition
of
his
very
existence
he
could
not
be
a
social
being
that
is
to
say
he
could
not
be
a
man
if
he
had
not
acquired
it
it
is
true
that
in
incarnating
themselves
in
individuals
collective
ideals
tend
to
individualize
themselves
each
understands
them
after
his
own
fashion
and
marks
them
with
his
own
stamp
he
suppresses
certain
elements
and
adds
others
thus
the
personal
ideal
disengages
itself
from
the
social
ideal
in
proportion
as
the
individual
personality
develops
itself
and
becomes
an
autonomous
source
of
action
but
if
we
wish
to
understand
this
aptitude
so
singular
in
appearance
of
living
outside
of
reality
it
is
enough
to
connect
it
with
the
social
conditions
upon
which
it
depends
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
seeing
in
this
theory
of
religion
a
simple
restatement
of
historical
materialism
that
would
be
misunderstanding
our
thought
to
an
extreme
degree
in
showing
that
religion
is
something
essentially
social
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
confines
itself
to
translating
into
another
language
the
material
forms
of
society
and
its
immediate
vital
necessities
it
is
true
that
we
take
it
as
evident
that
social
life
depends
upon
its
material
foundation
and
bears
its
mark
just
as
the
mental
life
of
an
individual
depends
upon
his
nervous
system
and
in
fact
his
whole
organism
but
collective
consciousness
is
something
more
than
a
mere
epiphenomenon
of
its
morphological
basis
just
as
individual
consciousness
is
something
more
than
a
simple
efflorescence
of
the
nervous
system
in
order
that
the
former
may
appear
a
synthesis
of
particular
consciousnesses
is
required
now
this
synthesis
has
the
effect
of
disengaging
a
whole
world
of
sentiments
ideas
and
images
which
once
born
obey
laws
all
their
own
they
attract
each
other
repel
each
other
unite
divide
themselves
and
multiply
though
these
combinations
are
not
commanded
and
necessitated
by
the
condition
of
the
underlying
reality
the
life
thus
brought
into
being
even
enjoys
so
great
an
independence
that
it
sometimes
indulges
in
manifestations
with
no
purpose
or
utility
of
any
sort
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
affirming
itself
we
have
shown
that
this
is
often
precisely
the
case
with
ritual
activity
and
mythological
thought
but
if
religion
is
the
product
of
social
causes
how
can
we
explain
the
individual
cult
and
the
universalistic
character
of
certain
religions
if
it
is
born
foro
how
has
it
been
able
to
pass
into
the
inner
conscience
of
the
individual
and
penetrate
there
ever
more
and
more
profoundly
if
it
is
the
work
of
definite
and
individualized
societies
how
has
it
been
able
to
detach
itself
from
them
even
to
the
point
of
being
conceived
as
something
common
to
all
humanity
in
the
course
of
our
studies
we
have
met
with
the
germs
of
individual
religion
and
of
religious
cosmopolitanism
and
we
have
seen
how
they
were
formed
thus
we
possess
the
more
general
elements
of
the
reply
which
is
to
be
given
to
this
double
question
we
have
shown
how
the
religious
force
which
animates
the
clan
particularizes
itself
by
incarnating
itself
in
particular
consciousnesses
thus
secondary
sacred
beings
are
formed
each
individual
has
his
own
made
in
his
own
image
associated
to
his
own
intimate
life
bound
up
with
his
own
destiny
it
is
the
soul
the
individual
totem
the
protecting
ancestor
etc
these
beings
are
the
object
of
rites
which
the
individual
can
celebrate
by
himself
outside
of
any
group
this
is
the
first
form
of
the
individual
cult
to
be
sure
it
is
only
a
very
rudimentary
cult
but
since
the
personality
of
the
individual
is
still
only
slightly
marked
and
but
little
value
is
attributed
to
it
the
cult
which
expresses
it
could
hardly
be
expected
to
be
very
highly
developed
as
yet
but
as
individuals
have
differentiated
themselves
more
and
more
and
the
value
of
an
individual
has
increased
the
corresponding
cult
has
taken
a
relatively
greater
place
in
the
totality
of
the
religious
life
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
more
fully
closed
to
outside
influences
thus
the
existence
of
individual
cults
implies
nothing
which
contradicts
or
embarrasses
the
sociological
interpretation
of
religion
for
the
religious
forces
to
which
it
addresses
itself
are
only
the
individualized
forms
of
collective
forces
therefore
even
when
religion
seems
to
be
entirely
within
the
individual
conscience
it
is
still
in
society
that
it
finds
the
living
source
from
which
it
is
nourished
we
are
now
able
to
appreciate
the
value
of
the
radical
individualism
which
would
make
religion
something
purely
individual
it
misunderstands
the
fundamental
conditions
of
the
religious
life
if
up
to
the
present
it
has
remained
in
the
stage
of
theoretical
aspirations
which
have
never
been
realized
it
is
because
it
is
unrealizable
a
philosophy
may
well
be
elaborated
in
the
silence
of
the
interior
imagination
but
not
so
a
faith
for
before
all
else
a
faith
is
warmth
life
enthusiasm
the
exaltation
of
the
whole
mental
life
the
raising
of
the
individual
above
himself
now
how
could
he
add
to
the
energies
which
he
possesses
without
going
outside
himself
how
could
he
surpass
himself
merely
by
his
own
forces
the
only
source
of
life
at
which
we
can
morally
reanimate
ourselves
is
that
formed
by
the
society
of
our
fellow
beings
the
only
moral
forces
with
which
we
can
sustain
and
increase
our
own
are
those
which
we
get
from
others
let
us
even
admit
that
there
really
are
beings
more
or
less
analogous
to
those
which
the
mythologies
represent
in
order
that
they
may
exercise
over
souls
the
useful
direction
which
is
their
reason
for
existence
it
is
necessary
that
men
believe
in
them
now
these
beliefs
are
active
only
when
they
are
partaken
by
many
a
man
can
not
retain
them
any
length
of
time
by
a
purely
personal
effort
it
is
not
thus
that
they
are
born
or
that
they
are
acquired
it
is
even
doubtful
if
they
can
be
kept
under
these
conditions
in
fact
a
man
who
has
a
veritable
faith
feels
an
invincible
need
of
spreading
it
therefore
he
leaves
his
isolation
approaches
others
and
seeks
to
convince
them
and
it
is
the
ardour
of
the
convictions
which
he
arouses
that
strengthens
his
own
it
would
quickly
weaken
if
it
remained
alone
it
is
the
same
with
religious
universalism
as
with
this
individualism
far
from
being
an
exclusive
attribute
of
certain
very
great
religions
we
have
found
it
not
at
the
base
it
is
true
but
at
the
summit
of
the
australian
system
bunjil
daramulun
or
baiame
are
not
simple
tribal
gods
each
of
them
is
recognized
by
a
number
of
different
tribes
in
a
sense
their
cult
is
international
this
conception
is
therefore
very
near
to
that
found
in
the
most
recent
theologies
so
certain
writers
have
felt
it
their
duty
to
deny
its
authenticity
howsoever
incontestable
this
may
be
and
we
have
been
able
to
show
how
this
has
been
formed
neighbouring
tribes
of
a
similar
civilization
can
not
fail
to
be
in
constant
relations
with
each
other
all
sorts
of
circumstances
give
an
occasion
for
it
besides
commerce
which
is
still
rudimentary
there
are
marriages
these
international
marriages
are
very
common
in
australia
in
the
course
of
these
meetings
men
naturally
become
conscious
of
the
moral
relationship
which
united
them
they
have
the
same
social
organization
the
same
division
into
phratries
clans
and
matrimonial
classes
they
practise
the
same
rites
of
initiation
or
wholly
similar
ones
mutual
loans
and
treaties
result
in
reinforcing
these
spontaneous
resemblances
the
gods
to
which
these
manifestly
identical
institutions
were
attached
could
hardly
have
remained
distinct
in
their
minds
everything
tended
to
bring
them
together
and
consequently
even
supposing
that
each
tribe
elaborated
the
notion
independently
they
must
necessarily
have
tended
to
confound
themselves
with
each
other
also
it
is
probable
that
it
was
in
assemblies
that
they
were
first
conceived
for
they
are
chiefly
the
gods
of
initiation
and
in
the
initiation
ceremonies
the
different
tribes
are
usually
represented
so
if
sacred
beings
are
formed
which
are
connected
with
no
geographically
determined
society
that
is
not
because
they
have
an
origin
it
is
because
there
are
other
groups
above
these
geographically
determined
ones
whose
contours
are
less
clearly
marked
they
have
no
fixed
frontiers
but
include
all
sorts
of
more
or
less
neighbouring
and
related
tribes
the
particular
social
life
thus
created
tends
to
spread
itself
over
an
area
with
no
definite
limits
naturally
the
mythological
personages
who
correspond
to
it
have
the
same
character
their
sphere
of
influence
is
not
limited
they
go
beyond
the
particular
tribes
and
their
territory
they
are
the
great
international
gods
now
there
is
nothing
in
this
situation
which
is
peculiar
to
australian
societies
there
is
no
people
and
no
state
which
is
not
a
part
of
another
society
more
or
less
unlimited
which
embraces
all
the
peoples
and
all
the
states
with
which
the
first
comes
in
contact
either
directly
or
indirectly
there
is
no
national
life
which
is
not
dominated
by
a
collective
life
of
an
international
nature
in
proportion
as
we
advance
in
history
these
international
groups
acquire
a
greater
importance
and
extent
thus
we
see
how
in
certain
cases
this
universalistic
tendency
has
been
able
to
develop
itself
to
the
point
of
affecting
not
only
the
higher
ideas
of
the
religious
system
but
even
the
principles
upon
which
it
rests
ii
thus
there
is
something
eternal
in
religion
which
is
destined
to
survive
all
the
particular
symbols
in
which
religious
thought
has
successively
enveloped
itself
there
can
be
no
society
which
does
not
feel
the
need
of
upholding
and
reaffirming
at
regular
intervals
the
collective
sentiments
and
the
collective
ideas
which
make
its
unity
and
its
personality
now
this
moral
remaking
can
not
be
achieved
except
by
the
means
of
reunions
assemblies
and
meetings
where
the
individuals
being
closely
united
to
one
another
reaffirm
in
common
their
common
sentiments
hence
come
ceremonies
which
do
not
differ
from
regular
religious
ceremonies
either
in
their
object
the
results
which
they
produce
or
the
processes
employed
to
attain
these
results
what
essential
difference
is
there
between
an
assembly
of
christians
celebrating
the
principal
dates
of
the
life
of
christ
or
of
jews
remembering
the
exodus
from
egypt
or
the
promulgation
of
the
decalogue
and
a
reunion
of
citizens
commemorating
the
promulgation
of
a
new
moral
or
legal
system
or
some
great
event
in
the
national
life
if
we
find
a
little
difficulty
in
imagining
what
these
feasts
and
ceremonies
of
the
future
could
consist
in
it
is
because
we
are
going
through
a
stage
of
transition
and
moral
mediocrity
the
great
things
of
the
past
which
filled
our
fathers
with
enthusiasm
do
not
excite
the
same
ardour
in
us
either
because
they
have
come
into
common
usage
to
such
an
extent
that
we
are
unconscious
of
them
or
else
because
they
no
longer
answer
to
our
actual
aspirations
but
as
yet
there
is
nothing
to
replace
them
we
can
no
longer
impassionate
ourselves
for
the
principles
in
the
name
of
which
christianity
recommended
to
masters
that
they
treat
their
slaves
humanely
and
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
which
it
has
formed
of
human
equality
and
fraternity
seems
to
us
to
leave
too
large
a
place
for
unjust
inequalities
its
pity
for
the
outcast
seems
to
us
too
platonic
we
desire
another
which
would
be
more
practicable
but
as
yet
we
can
not
clearly
see
what
it
should
be
nor
how
it
could
be
realized
in
facts
in
a
word
the
old
gods
are
growing
old
or
already
dead
and
others
are
not
yet
born
this
is
what
rendered
vain
the
attempt
of
comte
with
the
old
historic
souvenirs
artificially
revived
it
is
life
itself
and
not
a
dead
past
which
can
produce
a
living
cult
but
this
state
of
incertitude
and
confused
agitation
can
not
last
for
ever
a
day
will
come
when
our
societies
will
know
again
those
hours
of
creative
effervescence
in
the
course
of
which
new
ideas
arise
and
new
formulæ
are
found
which
serve
for
a
while
as
a
guide
to
humanity
and
when
these
hours
shall
have
been
passed
through
once
men
will
spontaneously
feel
the
need
of
reliving
them
from
time
to
time
in
thought
that
is
to
say
of
keeping
alive
their
memory
by
means
of
celebrations
which
regularly
reproduce
their
fruits
we
have
already
seen
how
the
french
revolution
established
a
whole
cycle
of
holidays
to
keep
the
principles
with
which
it
was
inspired
in
a
state
of
perpetual
youth
if
this
institution
quickly
fell
away
it
was
because
the
revolutionary
faith
lasted
but
a
moment
and
deceptions
and
discouragements
rapidly
succeeded
the
first
moments
of
enthusiasm
but
though
the
work
may
have
miscarried
it
enables
us
to
imagine
what
might
have
happened
in
other
conditions
and
everything
leads
us
to
believe
that
it
will
be
taken
up
again
sooner
or
later
there
are
no
gospels
which
are
immortal
but
neither
is
there
any
reason
for
believing
that
humanity
is
incapable
of
inventing
new
ones
as
to
the
question
of
what
symbols
this
new
faith
will
express
itself
with
whether
they
will
resemble
those
of
the
past
or
not
and
whether
or
not
they
will
be
more
adequate
for
the
reality
which
they
seek
to
translate
that
is
something
which
surpasses
the
human
faculty
of
foresight
and
which
does
not
appertain
to
the
principal
question
but
feasts
and
rites
in
a
word
the
cult
are
not
the
whole
religion
this
is
not
merely
a
system
of
practices
but
also
a
system
of
ideas
whose
object
is
to
explain
the
world
we
have
seen
that
even
the
humblest
have
their
cosmology
whatever
connection
there
may
be
between
these
two
elements
of
the
religious
life
they
are
still
quite
different
the
one
is
turned
towards
action
which
it
demands
and
regulates
the
other
is
turned
towards
thought
which
it
enriches
and
organizes
then
they
do
not
depend
upon
the
same
conditions
and
consequently
it
may
be
asked
if
the
second
answers
to
necessities
as
universal
and
as
permanent
as
the
first
when
specific
characteristics
are
attributed
to
religious
thought
and
when
it
is
believed
that
its
function
is
to
express
by
means
peculiar
to
itself
an
aspect
of
reality
which
evades
ordinary
knowledge
as
well
as
science
one
naturally
refuses
to
admit
that
religion
can
ever
abandon
its
speculative
rôle
but
our
analysis
of
the
facts
does
not
seem
to
have
shown
this
specific
quality
of
religion
the
religion
which
we
have
just
studied
is
one
of
those
whose
symbols
are
the
most
disconcerting
for
the
reason
there
all
appears
mysterious
these
beings
which
belong
to
the
most
heterogeneous
groups
at
the
same
time
who
multiply
without
ceasing
to
be
one
who
divide
without
diminishing
all
seem
at
first
view
to
belong
to
an
entirely
different
world
from
the
one
where
we
live
some
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
mind
which
constructed
them
ignored
the
laws
of
logic
completely
perhaps
the
contrast
between
reason
and
faith
has
never
been
more
thorough
then
if
there
has
ever
been
a
moment
in
history
when
their
heterogeneousness
should
have
stood
out
clearly
it
is
here
but
contrary
to
all
appearances
as
we
have
pointed
out
the
realities
to
which
religious
speculation
is
then
applied
are
the
same
as
those
which
later
serve
as
the
subject
of
reflection
for
philosophers
they
are
nature
man
society
the
mystery
which
appears
to
surround
them
is
wholly
superficial
and
disappears
before
a
more
painstaking
observation
it
is
enough
merely
to
set
aside
the
veil
with
which
mythological
imagination
has
covered
them
for
them
to
appear
such
as
they
really
are
religion
sets
itself
to
translate
these
realities
into
an
intelligible
language
which
does
not
differ
in
nature
from
that
employed
by
science
the
attempt
is
made
by
both
to
connect
things
with
each
other
to
establish
internal
relations
between
them
to
classify
them
and
to
systematize
them
we
have
even
seen
that
the
essential
ideas
of
scientific
logic
are
of
religious
origin
it
is
true
that
in
order
to
utilize
them
science
gives
them
a
new
elaboration
it
purges
them
of
all
accidental
elements
in
a
general
way
it
brings
a
spirit
of
criticism
into
all
its
doings
which
religion
ignores
it
surrounds
itself
with
precautions
to
escape
precipitation
and
bias
and
to
hold
aside
the
passions
prejudices
and
all
subjective
influences
but
these
perfectionings
of
method
are
not
enough
to
differentiate
it
from
religion
in
this
regard
both
pursue
the
same
end
scientific
thought
is
only
a
more
perfect
form
of
religious
thought
thus
it
seems
natural
that
the
second
should
progressively
retire
before
the
first
as
this
becomes
better
fitted
to
perform
the
task
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
regression
has
taken
place
in
the
course
of
history
having
left
religion
science
tends
to
substitute
itself
for
this
latter
in
all
that
which
concerns
the
cognitive
and
intellectual
functions
christianity
has
already
definitely
consecrated
this
substitution
in
the
order
of
material
things
seeing
in
matter
that
which
is
profane
before
all
else
it
readily
left
the
knowledge
of
this
to
another
discipline
mundum
hominum
he
gave
the
world
over
to
the
disputes
of
men
it
is
thus
that
the
natural
sciences
have
been
able
to
establish
themselves
and
make
their
authority
recognized
without
very
great
difficulty
but
it
could
not
give
up
the
world
of
souls
so
easily
for
it
is
before
all
over
souls
that
the
god
of
the
christians
aspires
to
reign
that
is
why
the
idea
of
submitting
the
psychic
life
to
science
produced
the
effect
of
a
sort
of
profanation
for
a
long
time
even
it
is
repugnant
to
many
minds
however
experimental
and
comparative
psychology
is
founded
and
we
must
reckon
with
it
but
the
world
of
the
religious
and
moral
life
is
still
forbidden
the
great
majority
of
men
continue
to
believe
that
here
there
is
an
order
of
things
which
the
mind
can
not
penetrate
except
by
very
special
ways
hence
comes
the
active
resistance
which
is
met
with
every
time
that
someone
tries
to
treat
religious
and
moral
phenomena
scientifically
but
in
spite
of
these
oppositions
these
attempts
are
constantly
repeated
and
this
persistence
even
allows
us
to
foresee
that
this
final
barrier
will
finally
give
way
and
that
science
will
establish
herself
as
mistress
even
in
this
reserved
region
that
is
what
the
conflict
between
science
and
religion
really
amounts
to
it
is
said
that
science
denies
religion
in
principle
but
religion
exists
it
is
a
system
of
given
facts
in
a
word
it
is
a
reality
how
could
science
deny
this
reality
also
in
so
far
as
religion
is
action
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
means
of
making
men
live
science
could
not
take
its
place
for
even
if
this
expresses
life
it
does
not
create
it
it
may
well
seek
to
explain
the
faith
but
by
that
very
act
it
presupposes
it
thus
there
is
no
conflict
except
upon
one
limited
point
of
the
two
functions
which
religion
originally
fulfilled
there
is
one
and
only
one
which
tends
to
escape
it
more
and
more
that
is
its
speculative
function
that
which
science
refuses
to
grant
to
religion
is
not
its
right
to
exist
but
its
right
to
dogmatize
upon
the
nature
of
things
and
the
special
competence
which
it
claims
for
itself
for
knowing
man
and
the
world
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
does
not
know
itself
it
does
not
even
know
what
it
is
made
of
nor
to
what
need
it
answers
it
is
itself
a
subject
for
science
so
far
is
it
from
being
able
to
make
the
law
for
science
and
from
another
point
of
view
since
there
is
no
proper
subject
for
religious
speculation
outside
that
reality
to
which
scientific
reflection
is
applied
it
is
evident
that
this
former
can
not
play
the
same
rôle
in
the
future
that
it
has
played
in
the
past
however
it
seems
destined
to
transform
itself
rather
than
to
disappear
we
have
said
that
there
is
something
eternal
in
religion
it
is
the
cult
and
the
faith
men
can
not
celebrate
ceremonies
for
which
they
see
no
reason
nor
can
they
accept
a
faith
which
they
in
no
way
understand
to
spread
itself
or
merely
to
maintain
itself
it
must
be
justified
that
is
to
say
a
theory
must
be
made
of
it
a
theory
of
this
sort
must
undoubtedly
be
founded
upon
the
different
sciences
from
the
moment
when
these
exist
first
of
all
upon
the
social
sciences
for
religious
faith
has
its
origin
in
society
then
upon
psychology
for
society
is
a
synthesis
of
human
consciousnesses
and
finally
upon
the
sciences
of
nature
for
man
and
society
are
a
part
of
the
universe
and
can
be
abstracted
from
it
only
artificially
but
howsoever
important
these
facts
taken
from
the
constituted
sciences
may
be
they
are
not
enough
for
faith
is
before
all
else
an
impetus
to
action
while
science
no
matter
how
far
it
may
be
pushed
always
remains
at
a
distance
from
this
science
is
fragmentary
and
incomplete
it
advances
but
slowly
and
is
never
finished
but
life
can
not
wait
the
theories
which
are
destined
to
make
men
live
and
act
are
therefore
obliged
to
pass
science
and
complete
it
prematurely
they
are
possible
only
when
the
practical
exigencies
and
the
vital
necessities
which
we
feel
without
distinctly
conceiving
them
push
thought
in
advance
beyond
that
which
science
permits
us
to
affirm
thus
religions
even
the
most
rational
and
laicized
can
not
and
never
will
be
able
to
dispense
with
a
particular
form
of
speculation
which
though
having
the
same
subjects
as
science
itself
can
not
be
really
scientific
the
obscure
intuitions
of
sensation
and
sentiment
too
often
take
the
place
of
logical
reasons
on
one
side
this
speculation
resembles
that
which
we
meet
with
in
the
religions
of
the
past
but
on
another
it
is
different
while
claiming
and
exercising
the
right
of
going
beyond
science
it
must
commence
by
knowing
this
and
by
inspiring
itself
with
it
ever
since
the
authority
of
science
was
established
it
must
be
reckoned
with
one
can
go
farther
than
it
under
the
pressure
of
necessity
but
he
must
take
his
direction
from
it
he
can
affirm
nothing
that
it
denies
deny
nothing
that
it
affirms
and
establish
nothing
that
is
not
directly
or
indirectly
founded
upon
principles
taken
from
it
from
now
on
the
faith
no
longer
exercises
the
same
hegemony
as
formerly
over
the
system
of
ideas
that
we
may
continue
to
call
religion
a
rival
power
rises
up
before
it
which
being
born
of
it
ever
after
submits
it
to
its
criticism
and
control
and
everything
makes
us
foresee
that
this
control
will
constantly
become
more
extended
and
efficient
while
no
limit
can
be
assigned
to
its
future
influence
iii
but
if
the
fundamental
notions
of
science
are
of
a
religious
origin
how
has
religion
been
able
to
bring
them
forth
at
first
sight
one
does
not
see
what
relations
there
can
be
between
religion
and
logic
or
since
the
reality
which
religious
thought
expresses
is
society
the
question
can
be
stated
in
the
following
terms
which
make
the
entire
difficulty
appear
even
better
what
has
been
able
to
make
social
life
so
important
a
source
for
the
logical
life
it
seems
as
though
nothing
could
have
predestined
it
to
this
rôle
for
it
certainly
was
not
to
satisfy
their
speculative
needs
that
men
associated
themselves
together
perhaps
we
shall
be
found
over
bold
in
attempting
so
complex
a
question
here
to
treat
it
as
it
should
be
treated
the
sociological
conditions
of
knowledge
should
be
known
much
better
than
they
actually
are
we
are
only
beginning
to
catch
glimpses
of
some
of
them
however
the
question
is
so
grave
and
so
directly
implied
in
all
that
has
preceded
that
we
must
make
an
effort
not
to
leave
it
without
an
answer
perhaps
it
is
not
impossible
even
at
present
to
state
some
general
principles
which
may
at
least
aid
in
the
solution
logical
thought
is
made
up
of
concepts
seeking
how
society
can
have
played
a
rôle
in
the
genesis
of
logical
thought
thus
reduces
itself
to
seeking
how
it
can
have
taken
a
part
in
the
formation
of
concepts
if
as
is
ordinarily
the
case
we
see
in
the
concept
only
a
general
idea
the
problem
appears
insoluble
by
his
own
power
the
individual
can
compare
his
conceptions
and
images
disengage
that
which
they
have
in
common
and
thus
in
a
word
generalize
then
it
is
hard
to
see
why
this
generalization
should
be
possible
only
in
and
through
society
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
inadmissible
that
logical
thought
is
characterized
only
by
the
greater
extension
of
the
conceptions
of
which
it
is
made
up
if
particular
ideas
have
nothing
logical
about
them
why
should
it
be
different
with
general
ones
the
general
exists
only
in
the
particular
it
is
the
particular
simplified
and
impoverished
then
the
first
could
have
no
virtues
or
privileges
which
the
second
has
not
inversely
if
conceptual
thought
can
be
applied
to
the
class
species
or
variety
howsoever
restricted
these
may
be
why
can
it
not
be
extended
to
the
individual
that
is
to
say
to
the
limit
towards
which
the
conception
tends
proportionately
as
its
extension
diminishes
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
many
concepts
which
have
only
individuals
as
their
object
in
every
sort
of
religion
gods
are
individualities
distinct
from
each
other
however
they
are
conceived
not
perceived
each
people
represents
its
historic
or
legendary
heroes
in
fashions
which
vary
with
the
time
finally
every
one
of
us
forms
an
idea
of
the
individuals
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
of
their
character
of
their
appearance
their
distinctive
traits
and
their
moral
and
physical
temperaments
these
notions
too
are
real
concepts
it
is
true
that
in
general
they
are
formed
crudely
enough
but
even
among
scientific
concepts
are
there
a
great
many
that
are
perfectly
adequate
for
their
object
in
this
direction
there
are
only
differences
of
degree
between
them
therefore
the
concept
must
be
defined
by
other
characteristics
it
is
opposed
to
sensual
representations
of
every
order
sensations
perceptions
or
images
by
the
following
properties
sensual
representations
are
in
a
perpetual
flux
they
come
after
each
other
like
the
waves
of
a
river
and
even
during
the
time
that
they
last
they
do
not
remain
the
same
thing
each
of
them
is
an
integral
part
of
the
precise
instant
when
it
takes
place
we
are
never
sure
of
again
finding
a
perception
such
as
we
experienced
it
the
first
time
for
if
the
thing
perceived
has
not
changed
it
is
we
who
are
no
longer
the
same
on
the
contrary
the
concept
is
as
it
were
outside
of
time
and
change
it
is
in
the
depths
below
all
this
agitation
it
might
be
said
that
it
is
in
a
different
portion
of
the
mind
which
is
serener
and
calmer
it
does
not
move
of
itself
by
an
internal
and
spontaneous
evolution
but
on
the
contrary
it
resists
change
it
is
a
manner
of
thinking
that
at
every
moment
of
time
is
fixed
and
crystallized
in
so
far
as
it
is
what
it
ought
to
be
it
is
immutable
if
it
changes
it
is
not
because
it
is
its
nature
to
do
so
but
because
we
have
discovered
some
imperfection
in
it
it
is
because
it
had
to
be
rectified
the
system
of
concepts
with
which
we
think
in
everyday
life
is
that
expressed
by
the
vocabulary
of
our
mother
tongue
for
every
word
translates
a
concept
now
language
is
something
fixed
it
changes
but
very
slowly
and
consequently
it
is
the
same
with
the
conceptual
system
which
it
expresses
the
scholar
finds
himself
in
the
same
situation
in
regard
to
the
special
terminology
employed
by
the
science
to
which
he
has
consecrated
himself
and
hence
in
regard
to
the
special
scheme
of
concepts
to
which
this
terminology
corresponds
it
is
true
that
he
can
make
innovations
but
these
are
always
a
sort
of
violence
done
to
the
established
ways
of
thinking
and
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
relatively
immutable
the
concept
is
universal
or
at
least
capable
of
becoming
so
a
concept
is
not
my
concept
i
hold
it
in
common
with
other
men
or
in
any
case
can
communicate
it
to
them
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
make
a
sensation
pass
from
my
consciousness
into
that
of
another
it
holds
closely
to
my
organism
and
personality
and
can
not
be
detached
from
them
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
invite
others
to
place
themselves
before
the
same
object
as
myself
and
to
leave
themselves
to
its
action
on
the
other
hand
conversation
and
all
intellectual
communication
between
men
is
an
exchange
of
concepts
the
concept
is
an
essentially
impersonal
representation
it
is
through
it
that
human
intelligences
communicate
the
nature
of
the
concept
thus
defined
bespeaks
its
origin
if
it
is
common
to
all
it
is
the
work
of
the
community
since
it
bears
the
mark
of
no
particular
mind
it
is
clear
that
it
was
elaborated
by
a
unique
intelligence
where
all
others
meet
each
other
and
after
a
fashion
come
to
nourish
themselves
if
it
has
more
stability
than
sensations
or
images
it
is
because
the
collective
representations
are
more
stable
than
the
individual
ones
for
while
an
individual
is
conscious
even
of
the
slight
changes
which
take
place
in
his
environment
only
events
of
a
greater
gravity
can
succeed
in
affecting
the
mental
status
of
a
society
every
time
that
we
are
in
the
presence
of
a
of
thought
or
action
which
is
imposed
uniformly
upon
particular
wills
or
intelligences
this
pressure
exercised
over
the
individual
betrays
the
intervention
of
the
group
also
as
we
have
already
said
the
concepts
with
which
we
ordinarily
think
are
those
of
our
vocabulary
now
it
is
unquestionable
that
language
and
consequently
the
system
of
concepts
which
it
translates
is
the
product
of
a
collective
elaboration
what
it
expresses
is
the
manner
in
which
society
as
a
whole
represents
the
facts
of
experience
the
ideas
which
correspond
to
the
diverse
elements
of
language
are
thus
collective
representations
even
their
contents
bear
witness
to
the
same
fact
in
fact
there
are
scarcely
any
words
among
those
which
we
usually
employ
whose
meaning
does
not
pass
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
the
limits
of
our
personal
experience
very
frequently
a
term
expresses
things
which
we
have
never
perceived
or
experiences
which
we
have
never
had
or
of
which
we
have
never
been
the
witnesses
even
when
we
know
some
of
the
objects
which
it
concerns
it
is
only
as
particular
examples
that
they
serve
to
illustrate
the
idea
which
they
would
never
have
been
able
to
form
by
themselves
thus
there
is
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
condensed
in
the
word
which
i
never
collected
and
which
is
not
individual
it
even
surpasses
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
can
not
even
completely
appropriate
all
its
results
which
of
us
knows
all
the
words
of
the
language
he
speaks
and
the
entire
signification
of
each
this
remark
enables
us
to
determine
the
sense
in
which
we
mean
to
say
that
concepts
are
collective
representations
if
they
belong
to
a
whole
social
group
it
is
not
because
they
represent
the
average
of
the
corresponding
individual
representations
for
in
that
case
they
would
be
poorer
than
the
latter
in
intellectual
content
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
contain
much
that
surpasses
the
knowledge
of
the
average
individual
they
are
not
abstractions
which
have
a
reality
only
in
particular
consciousnesses
but
they
are
as
concrete
representations
as
an
individual
could
form
of
his
own
personal
environment
they
correspond
to
the
way
in
which
this
very
special
being
society
considers
the
things
of
its
own
proper
experience
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
concepts
are
nearly
always
general
ideas
and
if
they
express
categories
and
classes
rather
than
particular
objects
it
is
because
the
unique
and
variable
characteristics
of
things
interest
society
but
rarely
because
of
its
very
extent
it
can
scarcely
be
affected
by
more
than
their
general
and
permanent
qualities
therefore
it
is
to
this
aspect
of
affairs
that
it
gives
its
attention
it
is
a
part
of
its
nature
to
see
things
in
large
and
under
the
aspect
which
they
ordinarily
have
but
this
generality
is
not
necessary
for
them
and
in
any
case
even
when
these
representations
have
the
generic
character
which
they
ordinarily
have
they
are
the
work
of
society
and
are
enriched
by
its
experience
that
is
what
makes
conceptual
thought
so
valuable
for
us
if
concepts
were
only
general
ideas
they
would
not
enrich
knowledge
a
great
deal
for
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
the
general
contains
nothing
more
than
the
particular
but
if
before
all
else
they
are
collective
representations
they
add
to
that
which
we
can
learn
by
our
own
personal
experience
all
that
wisdom
and
science
which
the
group
has
accumulated
in
the
course
of
centuries
thinking
by
concepts
is
not
merely
seeing
reality
on
its
most
general
side
but
it
is
projecting
a
light
upon
the
sensation
which
illuminates
it
penetrates
it
and
transforms
it
conceiving
something
is
both
learning
its
essential
elements
better
and
also
locating
it
in
its
place
for
each
civilization
has
its
organized
system
of
concepts
which
characterizes
it
before
this
scheme
of
ideas
the
individual
is
in
the
same
situation
as
the
greek
noûs
of
plato
before
the
world
of
ideas
he
must
assimilate
them
to
himself
for
he
must
have
them
to
hold
intercourse
with
others
but
the
assimilation
is
always
imperfect
each
of
us
sees
them
after
his
own
fashion
there
are
some
which
escape
us
completely
and
remain
outside
of
our
circle
of
vision
there
are
others
of
which
we
perceive
certain
aspects
only
there
are
even
a
great
many
which
we
pervert
in
holding
for
as
they
are
collective
by
nature
they
can
not
become
individualized
without
being
retouched
modified
and
consequently
falsified
hence
comes
the
great
trouble
we
have
in
understanding
each
other
and
the
fact
that
we
even
lie
to
each
other
without
wishing
to
it
is
because
we
all
use
the
same
words
without
giving
them
the
same
meaning
we
are
now
able
to
see
what
the
part
of
society
in
the
genesis
of
logical
thought
is
this
is
possible
only
from
the
moment
when
above
the
fugitive
conceptions
which
they
owe
to
sensuous
experience
men
have
succeeded
in
conceiving
a
whole
world
of
stable
ideas
the
common
ground
of
all
intelligences
in
fact
logical
thinking
is
always
impersonal
thinking
and
is
also
thought
species
as
though
for
all
time
impersonality
and
stability
are
the
two
characteristics
of
truth
now
logical
life
evidently
presupposes
that
men
know
at
least
confusedly
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
truth
distinct
from
sensuous
appearances
but
how
have
they
been
able
to
arrive
at
this
conception
we
generally
talk
as
though
it
should
have
spontaneously
presented
itself
to
them
from
the
moment
they
opened
their
eyes
upon
the
world
however
there
is
nothing
in
immediate
experience
which
could
suggest
it
everything
even
contradicts
it
thus
the
child
and
the
animal
have
no
suspicion
of
it
history
shows
that
it
has
taken
centuries
for
it
to
disengage
and
establish
itself
in
our
western
world
it
was
with
the
great
thinkers
of
greece
that
it
first
became
clearly
conscious
of
itself
and
of
the
consequences
which
it
implies
when
the
discovery
was
made
it
caused
an
amazement
which
plato
has
translated
into
magnificent
language
but
if
it
is
only
at
this
epoch
that
the
idea
is
expressed
in
philosophic
formulæ
it
was
necessarily
in
the
stage
of
an
obscure
sentiment
philosophers
have
sought
to
elucidate
this
sentiment
but
they
have
not
succeeded
in
order
that
they
might
reflect
upon
it
and
analyse
it
it
was
necessary
that
it
be
given
them
and
that
they
seek
to
know
whence
it
came
that
is
to
say
in
what
experience
it
was
founded
this
is
in
collective
experience
it
is
under
the
form
of
collective
thought
that
impersonal
thought
is
for
the
first
time
revealed
to
humanity
we
can
not
see
by
what
other
way
this
revelation
could
have
been
made
from
the
mere
fact
that
society
exists
there
is
also
outside
of
the
individual
sensations
and
images
a
whole
system
of
representations
which
enjoy
marvellous
properties
by
means
of
them
men
understand
each
other
and
intelligences
grasp
each
other
they
have
within
them
a
sort
of
force
or
moral
ascendancy
in
virtue
of
which
they
impose
themselves
upon
individual
minds
hence
the
individual
at
least
obscurely
takes
account
of
the
fact
that
above
his
private
ideas
there
is
a
world
of
absolute
ideas
according
to
which
he
must
shape
his
own
he
catches
a
glimpse
of
a
whole
intellectual
kingdom
in
which
he
participates
but
which
is
greater
than
he
this
is
the
first
intuition
of
the
realm
of
truth
from
the
moment
when
he
first
becomes
conscious
of
these
higher
ideas
he
sets
himself
to
scrutinizing
their
nature
he
asks
whence
these
representations
hold
their
prerogatives
and
in
so
far
as
he
believes
that
he
has
discovered
their
causes
he
undertakes
to
put
these
causes
into
action
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
draw
from
them
by
his
own
force
the
effects
which
they
produce
that
is
to
say
he
attributes
to
himself
the
right
of
making
concepts
thus
the
faculty
of
conception
has
individualized
itself
but
to
understand
its
origins
and
function
it
must
be
attached
to
the
social
conditions
upon
which
it
depends
it
may
be
objected
that
we
show
the
concept
in
one
of
its
aspects
only
and
that
its
unique
rôle
is
not
the
assuring
of
a
harmony
among
minds
but
also
and
to
a
greater
extent
their
harmony
with
the
nature
of
things
it
seems
as
though
it
had
a
reason
for
existence
only
on
condition
of
being
true
that
is
to
say
objective
and
as
though
its
impersonality
were
only
a
consequence
of
its
objectivity
it
is
in
regard
to
things
thought
of
as
adequately
as
possible
that
minds
ought
to
communicate
nor
do
we
deny
that
the
evolution
of
concepts
has
been
partially
in
this
direction
the
concept
which
was
first
held
as
true
because
it
was
collective
tends
to
be
no
longer
collective
except
on
condition
of
being
held
as
true
we
demand
its
credentials
of
it
before
according
it
our
confidence
but
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
even
the
great
majority
of
the
concepts
which
we
use
are
not
methodically
constituted
we
get
them
from
language
that
is
to
say
from
common
experience
without
submitting
them
to
any
criticism
the
scientifically
elaborated
and
criticized
concepts
are
always
in
the
very
slight
minority
also
between
them
and
those
which
draw
all
their
authority
from
the
fact
that
they
are
collective
there
are
only
differences
of
degree
a
collective
representation
presents
guarantees
of
objectivity
by
the
fact
that
it
is
collective
for
it
is
not
without
sufficient
reason
that
it
has
been
able
to
generalize
and
maintain
itself
with
persistence
if
it
were
out
of
accord
with
the
nature
of
things
it
would
never
have
been
able
to
acquire
an
extended
and
prolonged
empire
over
intellects
at
bottom
the
confidence
inspired
by
scientific
concepts
is
due
to
the
fact
that
they
can
be
methodically
controlled
but
a
collective
representation
is
necessarily
submitted
to
a
control
that
is
repeated
indefinitely
the
men
who
accept
it
verify
it
by
their
own
experience
therefore
it
could
not
be
wholly
inadequate
for
its
subject
it
is
true
that
it
may
express
this
by
means
of
imperfect
symbols
but
scientific
symbols
themselves
are
never
more
than
approximative
it
is
precisely
this
principle
which
is
at
the
basis
of
the
method
which
we
follow
in
the
study
of
religious
phenomena
we
take
it
as
an
axiom
that
religious
beliefs
howsoever
strange
their
appearance
may
be
at
times
contain
a
truth
which
must
be
discovered
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
at
all
true
that
concepts
even
when
constructed
according
to
the
rules
of
science
get
their
authority
uniquely
from
their
objective
value
it
is
not
enough
that
they
be
true
to
be
believed
if
they
are
not
in
harmony
with
the
other
beliefs
and
opinions
or
in
a
word
with
the
mass
of
the
other
collective
representations
they
will
be
denied
minds
will
be
closed
to
them
consequently
it
will
be
as
though
they
did
not
exist
it
is
generally
sufficient
that
they
bear
the
stamp
of
science
to
receive
a
sort
of
privileged
credit
because
we
have
faith
in
science
but
this
faith
does
not
differ
essentially
from
religious
faith
in
the
last
resort
the
value
which
we
attribute
to
science
depends
upon
the
idea
which
we
collectively
form
of
its
nature
and
rôle
in
life
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
expresses
a
state
of
public
opinion
in
all
social
life
in
fact
science
rests
upon
opinion
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
this
opinion
can
be
taken
as
the
object
of
a
study
and
a
science
made
of
it
this
is
what
sociology
principally
consists
in
but
the
science
of
opinion
does
not
make
opinions
it
can
only
observe
them
and
make
them
more
conscious
of
themselves
it
is
true
that
by
this
means
it
can
lead
them
to
change
but
science
continues
to
be
dependent
upon
opinion
at
the
very
moment
when
it
seems
to
be
making
its
laws
for
as
we
have
already
shown
it
is
from
opinion
that
it
holds
the
force
necessary
to
act
upon
opinion
saying
that
concepts
express
the
manner
in
which
society
represents
things
is
also
saying
that
conceptual
thought
is
coeval
with
humanity
itself
we
refuse
to
see
in
it
the
product
of
a
more
or
less
retarded
culture
a
man
who
did
not
think
with
concepts
would
not
be
a
man
for
he
would
not
be
a
social
being
if
reduced
to
having
only
individual
perceptions
he
would
be
indistinguishable
from
the
beasts
if
it
has
been
possible
to
sustain
the
contrary
thesis
it
is
because
concepts
have
been
defined
by
characteristics
which
are
not
essential
to
them
they
have
been
identified
with
general
ideas
and
with
clearly
limited
and
circumscribed
general
ideas
in
these
conditions
it
has
possibly
seemed
as
though
the
inferior
societies
had
no
concepts
properly
so
called
for
they
have
only
rudimentary
processes
of
generalization
and
the
ideas
which
they
use
are
not
generally
very
well
defined
but
the
greater
part
of
our
concepts
are
equally
indetermined
we
force
ourselves
to
define
them
only
in
discussions
or
when
doing
careful
work
we
have
also
seen
that
conceiving
is
not
generalizing
thinking
conceptually
is
not
simply
isolating
and
grouping
together
the
common
characteristics
of
a
certain
number
of
objects
it
is
relating
the
variable
to
the
permanent
the
individual
to
the
social
and
since
logical
thought
commences
with
the
concept
it
follows
that
it
has
always
existed
there
is
no
period
in
history
when
men
have
lived
in
a
chronic
confusion
and
contradiction
to
be
sure
we
can
not
insist
too
much
upon
the
different
characteristics
which
logic
presents
at
different
periods
in
history
it
develops
like
the
societies
themselves
but
howsoever
real
these
differences
may
be
they
should
not
cause
us
to
neglect
the
similarities
which
are
no
less
essential
iv
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
take
up
a
final
question
which
has
already
been
raised
in
our
introduction
and
which
has
been
taken
as
understood
in
the
remainder
of
this
work
we
have
seen
that
at
least
some
of
the
categories
are
social
things
the
question
is
where
they
got
this
character
undoubtedly
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
since
they
are
themselves
concepts
they
are
the
work
of
the
group
it
can
even
be
said
that
there
are
no
other
concepts
which
present
to
an
equal
degree
the
signs
by
which
a
collective
representation
is
recognized
in
fact
their
stability
and
impersonality
are
such
that
they
have
often
passed
as
being
absolutely
universal
and
immutable
also
as
they
express
the
fundamental
conditions
for
an
agreement
between
minds
it
seems
evident
that
they
have
been
elaborated
by
society
but
the
problem
concerning
them
is
more
complex
for
they
are
social
in
another
sense
and
as
it
were
in
the
second
degree
they
not
only
come
from
society
but
the
things
which
they
express
are
of
a
social
nature
not
only
is
it
society
which
has
founded
them
but
their
contents
are
the
different
aspects
of
the
social
being
the
category
of
class
was
at
first
indistinct
from
the
concept
of
the
human
group
it
is
the
rhythm
of
social
life
which
is
at
the
basis
of
the
category
of
time
the
territory
occupied
by
the
society
furnished
the
material
for
the
category
of
space
it
is
the
collective
force
which
was
the
prototype
of
the
concept
of
efficient
force
an
essential
element
in
the
category
of
causality
however
the
categories
are
not
made
to
be
applied
only
to
the
social
realm
they
reach
out
to
all
reality
then
how
is
it
that
they
have
taken
from
society
the
models
upon
which
they
have
been
constructed
it
is
because
they
are
the
concepts
which
have
a
preponderating
part
in
our
knowledge
in
fact
the
function
of
the
categories
is
to
dominate
and
envelop
all
the
other
concepts
they
are
permanent
moulds
for
the
mental
life
now
for
them
to
embrace
such
an
object
they
must
be
founded
upon
a
reality
of
equal
amplitude
undoubtedly
the
relations
which
they
express
exist
in
an
implicit
way
in
individual
consciousnesses
the
individual
lives
in
time
and
as
we
have
said
he
has
a
certain
sense
of
temporal
orientation
he
is
situated
at
a
determined
point
in
space
and
it
has
even
been
held
and
sustained
with
good
reasons
that
all
sensations
have
something
special
about
them
he
has
a
feeling
of
resemblances
similar
representations
are
brought
together
and
the
new
representation
formed
by
their
union
has
a
sort
of
generic
character
we
also
have
the
sensation
of
a
certain
regularity
in
the
order
of
the
succession
of
phenomena
even
an
animal
is
not
incapable
of
this
however
all
these
relations
are
strictly
personal
for
the
individual
who
recognizes
them
and
consequently
the
notion
of
them
which
he
may
have
can
in
no
case
go
beyond
his
own
narrow
horizon
the
generic
images
which
are
formed
in
my
consciousness
by
the
fusion
of
similar
images
represent
only
the
objects
which
i
have
perceived
directly
there
is
nothing
there
which
could
give
me
the
idea
of
a
class
that
is
to
say
of
a
mould
including
the
group
of
all
possible
objects
which
satisfy
the
same
condition
also
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
idea
of
group
in
the
first
place
and
the
mere
observations
of
our
interior
life
could
never
awaken
that
in
us
but
above
all
there
is
no
individual
experience
howsoever
extended
and
prolonged
it
may
be
which
could
give
a
suspicion
of
the
existence
of
a
whole
class
which
would
embrace
every
single
being
and
to
which
other
classes
are
only
or
subordinated
species
this
idea
of
which
is
at
the
basis
of
the
classifications
which
we
have
just
cited
could
not
have
come
from
the
individual
himself
who
is
only
a
part
in
relation
to
the
whole
and
who
never
attains
more
than
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
reality
and
yet
there
is
perhaps
no
other
category
of
greater
importance
for
as
the
rôle
of
the
categories
is
to
envelop
all
the
other
concepts
the
category
would
seem
to
be
this
very
concept
of
the
theorists
of
knowledge
ordinarily
postulate
it
as
if
it
came
of
itself
while
it
really
surpasses
the
contents
of
each
individual
consciousness
taken
alone
to
an
infinite
degree
for
the
same
reasons
the
space
which
i
know
by
my
senses
of
which
i
am
the
centre
and
where
everything
is
disposed
in
relation
to
me
could
not
be
space
in
general
which
contains
all
extensions
and
where
these
are
by
personal
which
are
common
to
everybody
in
the
same
way
the
concrete
duration
which
i
feel
passing
within
me
and
with
me
could
not
give
me
the
idea
of
time
in
general
the
first
expresses
only
the
rhythm
of
my
individual
life
the
second
should
correspond
to
the
rhythm
of
a
life
which
is
not
that
of
any
individual
in
particular
but
in
which
all
participate
in
the
same
way
finally
the
regularities
which
i
am
able
to
conceive
in
the
manner
in
which
my
sensations
succeed
one
another
may
well
have
a
value
for
me
they
explain
how
it
comes
about
that
when
i
am
given
the
first
of
two
phenomena
whose
concurrence
i
have
observed
i
tend
to
expect
the
other
but
this
personal
state
of
expectation
could
not
be
confounded
with
the
conception
of
a
universal
order
of
succession
which
imposes
itself
upon
all
minds
and
all
events
since
the
world
expressed
by
the
entire
system
of
concepts
is
the
one
that
society
regards
society
alone
can
furnish
the
most
general
notions
with
which
it
should
be
represented
such
an
object
can
be
embraced
only
by
a
subject
which
contains
all
the
individual
subjects
within
it
since
the
universe
does
not
exist
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
thought
of
and
since
it
is
not
completely
thought
of
except
by
society
it
takes
a
place
in
this
latter
it
becomes
a
part
of
society
interior
life
while
this
is
the
totality
outside
of
which
nothing
exists
the
concept
of
totality
is
only
the
abstract
form
of
the
concept
of
society
it
is
the
whole
which
includes
all
things
the
supreme
class
which
embraces
all
other
classes
such
is
the
final
principle
upon
which
repose
all
these
primitive
classifications
where
beings
from
every
realm
are
placed
and
classified
in
social
forms
exactly
like
men
but
if
the
world
is
inside
of
society
the
space
which
this
latter
occupies
becomes
confounded
with
space
in
general
in
fact
we
have
seen
how
each
thing
has
its
assigned
place
in
social
space
and
the
degree
to
which
this
space
in
general
differs
from
the
concrete
expanses
which
we
perceive
is
well
shown
by
the
fact
that
this
localization
is
wholly
ideal
and
in
no
way
resembles
what
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
dictated
to
us
by
sensuous
experience
alone
for
the
same
reason
the
rhythm
of
collective
life
dominates
and
embraces
the
varied
rhythms
of
all
the
elementary
lives
from
which
it
results
consequently
the
time
which
it
expresses
dominates
and
embraces
all
particular
durations
it
is
time
in
general
for
a
long
time
the
history
of
the
world
has
been
only
another
aspect
of
the
history
of
society
the
one
commences
with
the
other
the
periods
of
the
first
are
determined
by
the
periods
of
the
second
this
impersonal
and
total
duration
is
measured
and
the
in
relation
to
which
it
is
divided
and
organized
are
fixed
by
the
movements
of
concentration
or
dispersion
of
society
or
more
generally
the
periodical
necessities
for
a
collective
renewal
if
these
critical
instants
are
generally
attached
to
some
material
phenomenon
such
as
the
regular
recurrence
of
such
or
such
a
star
or
the
alternation
of
the
seasons
it
is
because
objective
signs
are
necessary
to
make
this
essentially
social
organization
intelligible
to
all
in
the
same
way
finally
the
causal
relation
from
the
moment
when
it
is
collectively
stated
by
the
group
becomes
independent
of
every
individual
consciousness
it
rises
above
all
particular
minds
and
events
it
is
a
law
whose
value
depends
upon
no
person
we
have
already
shown
how
it
is
clearly
thus
that
it
seems
to
have
originated
another
reason
explains
why
the
constituent
elements
of
the
categories
should
have
been
taken
from
social
life
it
is
because
the
relations
which
they
express
could
not
have
been
learned
except
in
and
through
society
if
they
are
in
a
sense
immanent
in
the
life
of
an
individual
he
has
neither
a
reason
nor
the
means
for
learning
them
reflecting
upon
them
and
forming
them
into
distinct
ideas
in
order
to
orient
himself
personally
in
space
and
to
know
at
what
moments
he
should
satisfy
his
various
organic
needs
he
has
no
need
of
making
once
and
for
all
a
conceptual
representation
of
time
and
space
many
animals
are
able
to
find
the
road
which
leads
to
places
with
which
they
are
familiar
they
come
back
at
a
proper
moment
without
knowing
any
of
the
categories
sensations
are
enough
to
direct
them
automatically
they
would
also
be
enough
for
men
if
their
sensations
had
to
satisfy
only
individual
needs
to
recognize
the
fact
that
one
thing
resembles
another
which
we
have
already
experienced
it
is
in
no
way
necessary
that
we
arrange
them
all
in
groups
and
species
the
way
in
which
similar
images
call
up
each
other
and
unite
is
enough
to
give
the
feeling
of
resemblance
the
impression
that
a
certain
thing
has
already
been
seen
or
experienced
implies
no
classification
to
recognize
the
things
which
we
should
seek
or
from
which
we
should
flee
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
attach
the
effects
of
the
two
to
their
causes
by
a
logical
bond
if
individual
conveniences
were
the
only
ones
in
question
purely
empirical
sequences
and
strong
connections
between
the
concrete
representations
would
be
as
sure
guides
for
the
will
not
only
is
it
true
that
the
animal
has
no
others
but
also
our
own
personal
conduct
frequently
supposes
nothing
more
the
prudent
man
is
the
one
who
has
a
very
clear
sensation
of
what
must
be
done
but
which
he
would
ordinarily
be
quite
incapable
of
stating
as
a
general
law
it
is
a
different
matter
with
society
this
is
possible
only
when
the
individuals
and
things
which
compose
it
are
divided
into
certain
groups
that
is
to
say
classified
and
when
these
groups
are
classified
in
relation
to
each
other
society
supposes
a
organization
which
is
nothing
other
than
a
classification
this
organization
of
society
naturally
extends
itself
to
the
place
which
this
occupies
to
avoid
all
collisions
it
is
necessary
that
each
particular
group
have
a
determined
portion
of
space
assigned
to
it
in
other
terms
it
is
necessary
that
space
in
general
be
divided
differentiated
arranged
and
that
these
divisions
and
arrangements
be
known
to
everybody
on
the
other
hand
every
summons
to
a
celebration
a
hunt
or
a
military
expedition
implies
fixed
and
established
dates
and
consequently
that
a
common
time
is
agreed
upon
which
everybody
conceives
in
the
same
fashion
finally
the
of
many
persons
with
the
same
end
in
view
is
possible
only
when
they
are
in
agreement
as
to
the
relation
which
exists
between
this
end
and
the
means
of
attaining
it
that
is
to
say
when
the
same
causal
relation
is
admitted
by
all
the
in
the
enterprise
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
social
time
social
space
social
classes
and
causality
should
be
the
basis
of
the
corresponding
categories
since
it
is
under
their
social
forms
that
these
different
relations
were
first
grasped
with
a
certain
clarity
by
the
human
intellect
in
summing
up
then
we
must
say
that
society
is
not
at
all
the
illogical
or
incoherent
and
fantastic
being
which
it
has
too
often
been
considered
quite
on
the
contrary
the
collective
consciousness
is
the
highest
form
of
the
psychic
life
since
it
is
the
consciousness
of
the
consciousnesses
being
placed
outside
of
and
above
individual
and
local
contingencies
it
sees
things
only
in
their
permanent
and
essential
aspects
which
it
crystallizes
into
communicable
ideas
at
the
same
time
that
it
sees
from
above
it
sees
farther
at
every
moment
of
time
it
embraces
all
known
reality
that
is
why
it
alone
can
furnish
the
mind
with
the
moulds
which
are
applicable
to
the
totality
of
things
and
which
make
it
possible
to
think
of
them
it
does
not
create
these
moulds
artificially
it
finds
them
within
itself
it
does
nothing
but
become
conscious
of
them
they
translate
the
ways
of
being
which
are
found
in
all
the
stages
of
reality
but
which
appear
in
their
full
clarity
only
at
the
summit
because
the
extreme
complexity
of
the
psychic
life
which
passes
there
necessitates
a
greater
development
of
consciousness
attributing
social
origins
to
logical
thought
is
not
debasing
it
or
diminishing
its
value
or
reducing
it
to
nothing
more
than
a
system
of
artificial
combinations
on
the
contrary
it
is
relating
it
to
a
cause
which
implies
it
naturally
but
this
is
not
saying
that
the
ideas
elaborated
in
this
way
are
at
once
adequate
for
their
object
if
society
is
something
universal
in
relation
to
the
individual
it
is
none
the
less
an
individuality
itself
which
has
its
own
personal
physiognomy
and
its
idiosyncrasies
it
is
a
particular
subject
and
consequently
particularizes
whatever
it
thinks
of
therefore
collective
representations
also
contain
subjective
elements
and
these
must
be
progressively
rooted
out
if
we
are
to
approach
reality
more
closely
but
howsoever
crude
these
may
have
been
at
the
beginning
the
fact
remains
that
with
them
the
germ
of
a
new
mentality
was
given
to
which
the
individual
could
never
have
raised
himself
by
his
own
efforts
by
them
the
way
was
opened
to
a
stable
impersonal
and
organized
thought
which
then
had
nothing
to
do
except
to
develop
its
nature
also
the
causes
which
have
determined
this
development
do
not
seem
to
be
specifically
different
from
those
which
gave
it
its
initial
impulse
if
logical
thought
tends
to
rid
itself
more
and
more
of
the
subjective
and
personal
elements
which
it
still
retains
from
its
origin
it
is
not
because
factors
have
intervened
it
is
much
rather
because
a
social
life
of
a
new
sort
is
developing
it
is
this
international
life
which
has
already
resulted
in
universalizing
religious
beliefs
as
it
extends
the
collective
horizon
enlarges
the
society
ceases
to
appear
as
the
only
whole
to
become
a
part
of
a
much
vaster
one
with
indetermined
frontiers
which
is
susceptible
of
advancing
indefinitely
consequently
things
can
no
longer
be
contained
in
the
social
moulds
according
to
which
they
were
primitively
classified
they
must
be
organized
according
to
principles
which
are
their
own
so
logical
organization
differentiates
itself
from
the
social
organization
and
becomes
autonomous
really
and
truly
human
thought
is
not
a
primitive
fact
it
is
the
product
of
history
it
is
the
ideal
limit
towards
which
we
are
constantly
approaching
but
which
in
all
probability
we
shall
never
succeed
in
reaching
thus
it
is
not
at
all
true
that
between
science
on
the
one
hand
and
morals
and
religion
on
the
other
there
exists
that
sort
of
antinomy
which
has
so
frequently
been
admitted
for
the
two
forms
of
human
activity
really
come
from
one
and
the
same
source
kant
understood
this
very
well
and
therefore
he
made
the
speculative
reason
and
the
practical
reason
two
different
aspects
of
the
same
faculty
according
to
him
what
makes
their
unity
is
the
fact
that
the
two
are
directed
towards
the
universal
rational
thinking
is
thinking
according
to
the
laws
which
are
imposed
upon
all
reasonable
beings
acting
morally
is
conducting
one
self
according
to
those
maxims
which
can
be
extended
without
contradiction
to
all
wills
in
other
words
science
and
morals
imply
that
the
individual
is
capable
of
raising
himself
above
his
own
peculiar
point
of
view
and
of
living
an
impersonal
life
in
fact
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
this
is
a
trait
common
to
all
the
higher
forms
of
thought
and
action
what
kant
system
does
not
explain
however
is
the
origin
of
this
sort
of
contradiction
which
is
realized
in
man
why
is
he
forced
to
do
violence
to
himself
by
leaving
his
individuality
and
inversely
why
is
the
impersonal
law
obliged
to
be
dissipated
by
incarnating
itself
in
individuals
is
it
answered
that
there
are
two
antagonistic
worlds
in
which
we
participate
equally
the
world
of
matter
and
sense
on
the
one
hand
and
the
world
of
pure
and
impersonal
reason
on
the
other
that
is
merely
repeating
the
question
in
slightly
different
terms
for
what
we
are
trying
to
find
out
is
why
we
must
lead
these
two
existences
at
the
same
time
why
do
these
two
worlds
which
seem
to
contradict
each
other
not
remain
outside
of
each
other
and
why
must
they
mutually
penetrate
one
another
in
spite
of
their
antagonism
the
only
explanation
which
has
ever
been
given
of
this
singular
necessity
is
the
hypothesis
of
the
fall
with
all
the
difficulties
which
it
implies
and
which
need
not
be
repeated
here
on
the
other
hand
all
mystery
disappears
the
moment
that
it
is
recognized
that
impersonal
reason
is
only
another
name
given
to
collective
thought
for
this
is
possible
only
through
a
group
of
individuals
it
supposes
them
and
in
their
turn
they
suppose
it
for
they
can
continue
to
exist
only
by
grouping
themselves
together
the
kingdom
of
ends
and
impersonal
truths
can
realize
itself
only
by
the
of
particular
wills
and
the
reasons
for
which
these
participate
in
it
are
the
same
as
those
for
which
they
in
a
word
there
is
something
impersonal
in
us
because
there
is
something
social
in
all
of
us
and
since
social
life
embraces
at
once
both
representations
and
practices
this
impersonality
naturally
extends
to
ideas
as
well
as
to
acts
perhaps
some
will
be
surprised
to
see
us
connect
the
most
elevated
forms
of
thought
with
society
the
cause
appears
quite
humble
in
consideration
of
the
value
which
we
attribute
to
the
effect
between
the
world
of
the
senses
and
appetites
on
the
one
hand
and
that
of
reason
and
morals
on
the
other
the
distance
is
so
considerable
that
the
second
would
seem
to
have
been
able
to
add
itself
to
the
first
only
by
a
creative
act
but
attributing
to
society
this
preponderating
rôle
in
the
genesis
of
our
nature
is
not
denying
this
creation
for
society
has
a
creative
power
which
no
other
observable
being
can
equal
in
fact
all
creation
if
not
a
mystical
operation
which
escapes
science
and
knowledge
is
the
product
of
a
synthesis
now
if
the
synthesis
of
particular
conceptions
which
take
place
in
each
individual
consciousness
are
already
and
of
themselves
productive
of
novelties
how
much
more
efficacious
these
vast
syntheses
of
complete
consciousnesses
which
make
society
must
be
a
society
is
the
most
powerful
combination
of
physical
and
moral
forces
of
which
nature
offers
us
an
example
nowhere
else
is
an
equal
richness
of
different
materials
carried
to
such
a
degree
of
concentration
to
be
found
then
it
is
not
surprising
that
a
higher
life
disengages
itself
which
by
reacting
upon
the
elements
of
which
it
is
the
product
raises
them
to
a
higher
plane
of
existence
and
transforms
them
thus
sociology
appears
destined
to
open
a
new
way
to
the
science
of
man
up
to
the
present
thinkers
were
placed
before
this
double
alternative
either
explain
the
superior
and
specific
faculties
of
men
by
connecting
them
to
the
inferior
forms
of
his
being
the
reason
to
the
senses
or
the
mind
to
matter
which
is
equivalent
to
denying
their
uniqueness
or
else
attach
them
to
some
reality
which
was
postulated
but
whose
existence
could
be
established
by
no
observation
what
put
them
in
this
difficulty
was
the
fact
that
the
individual
passed
as
being
the
the
ultimate
creation
of
nature
it
seemed
that
there
was
nothing
beyond
him
or
at
least
nothing
that
science
could
touch
but
from
the
moment
when
it
is
recognized
that
above
the
individual
there
is
society
and
that
this
is
not
a
nominal
being
created
by
reason
but
a
system
of
active
forces
a
new
manner
of
explaining
men
becomes
possible
to
conserve
his
distinctive
traits
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
put
them
outside
experience
at
least
before
going
to
this
last
extremity
it
would
be
well
to
see
if
that
which
surpasses
the
individual
though
it
is
within
him
does
not
come
from
this
reality
which
we
experience
in
society
to
be
sure
it
can
not
be
said
at
present
to
what
point
these
explanations
may
be
able
to
reach
and
whether
or
not
they
are
of
a
nature
to
resolve
all
the
problems
but
it
is
equally
impossible
to
mark
in
advance
a
limit
beyond
which
they
can
not
go
what
must
be
done
is
to
try
the
hypothesis
and
submit
it
as
methodically
as
possible
to
the
control
of
facts
this
is
what
we
have
tried
to
do
index
or
mythical
period
ambiguity
of
sacredness
ff
explanation
of
ff
totemism
not
animism
as
expounded
by
tylor
and
spencer
ff
how
it
explains
the
origin
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
of
spirits
their
cult
and
the
criticism
of
these
theories
ff
implies
that
religions
are
systems
of
hallucinations
which
is
its
best
refutation
anthropomorphism
not
found
among
primitives
denied
by
spencer
can
not
explain
totemic
view
of
world
or
primitive
rites
apriorism

way
we

we

call

primitives
undoubtedly
the
expression
lacks
precision
but
that
is
hardly
evitable
and
besides
when
we
have
taken
pains
to
fix
the
meaning
it
is
not
inconvenient
but
that
is
not
equivalent
to
saying
that
all
luxury
is
lacking
to
the
primitive
cults
on
the
contrary
we
shall
see
that
in
every
religion
there
are
beliefs

practices
which
do
not

this
luxury
is
indispensable
to
the
religious
life
it
is
at
its
very
heart
but
it
is
much
more
rudimentary
in
the
inferior
religions
than
in
the
others
so
we
are
better
able
to
determine
its
reason
for
existence
here
it
is
seen
that
we
give
a
wholly
relative
sense
to
this
word
origins
just
as
to
the
word
primitive
by
it
we
do
not
mean
an
absolute
beginning
but
the
most
simple
social
condition
that
is
actually
known
or
that
beyond
which
we
can
not
go
at
present
when
we
speak
of
the
origins
or
of
the
commencement
of
religious
history
or
thought
it
is
in
this
sense
that
our
statements
should
be
understood
we
say
that
time
and
space
are
categories
because
there
is
no
difference
between
the
rôle
played
by
these
ideas
in
the
intellectual
life
and
that
which
falls
to
the
ideas
of
class
or
cause
on
this
point
see

see
the
support
given
this
assertion
in

thus
we
see
all
the
difference
which
exists
between
the
group
of
sensations
and
images
which
serve
to
locate
us
in
time
and
the
category
of
time
the
first
are
the
summary
of
individual
experiences
which
are
of
value
only
for
the
person
who
experienced
them
but
what
the
category
of
time
expresses
is
a
time
common
to
the
group
a
social
time
so
to
speak
in
itself
it
is
a
veritable
social
institution
also
it
is
peculiar
to
man
animals
have
no
representations
of
this
sort
this
distinction
between
the
category
of
time
and
the
corresponding
sensations
could
be
made
equally
well
in
regard
to
space
or
cause
perhaps
this
would
aid
in
clearing
up
certain
confusions
which
are
maintained
by
the
controversies
of
which
these
questions
are
the
subject
we
shall
return
to
this
point
in
the
conclusion
of
the
present
work
pp
ff
or
else
it
would
be
necessary
to
admit
that
all
individuals
in
virtue
of
their
constitution
are
spontaneously
affected
in
the
same
manner
by
the
different
parts
of
space
which
is
more
improbable
especially
as
in
themselves
the
different
regions
are
sympathetically
indifferent
also
the
divisions

is

they

to
say
that
mythological
thought
ignores
it
but
that
it
contradicts
it
more
frequently
and
openly
than
scientific
thought
does
inversely
we
shall
show
that
science
can
not
escape
violating
it
though
it
holds
to
it
far
more
scrupulously
than
religion
does
on
this
subject
as
on
many
others
there
are
only
differences
of
degree
between
science
and
religion
but
if
these
differences
should
not
be
exaggerated
they
must
be
noted
for
they
are
significant
this
hypothesis
has
already
been
set
forth
by
the
founders
of
the
it
is
especially
remarked
in
a
short
article
by
windelbrand
entitled
erkenntnisslehre
unter
dem
völkerpsychologischen
in
the
viii
pp
ff
cf
a
note
of
steinthal
on
the
same
subject
pp
ff
even
in
the
theory
of
spencer
it
is
by
individual
experience
that
the
categories
are
made
the
only
difference
which
there
is
in
this
regard
between
ordinary
empiricism
and
evolutionary
empiricism
is
that
according
to
this
latter
the
results
of
individual
experience
are
accumulated
by
heredity
but
this
accumulation
adds
nothing
essential
to
them
no
element
enters
into
their
composition
which
does
not
have
its
origin
in
the
experience
of
the
individual
according
to
this
theory
also
the
necessity
with
which
the
categories
actually
impose
themselves
upon
us
is
the
product
of
an
illusion
and
a
superstitious
prejudice
strongly
rooted
in
the
organism
to
be
sure
but
without
foundation
in
the
nature
of
things
perhaps
some
will
be
surprised
that
we
do
not
define
the
apriorist
theory
by
the
hypothesis
of
innateness
but
this
conception
really
plays
a
secondary
part
in
the
doctrine
it
is
a
simple
way
of
stating
the
impossibility
of
reducing
rational
knowledge
to
empirical
data
saying
that
the
former
is
innate
is
only
a
positive
way
of
saying
that
it
is
not
the
product
of
experience
such
as
it
is
ordinarily
conceived
at
least
in
so
far
as
there
are
any
representations
which
are
individual
and
hence
wholly
empirical
but
there
are
in
fact
probably
none
where
the
two
elements
are
not
found
closely
united
this
irreducibility
must
not
be
taken
in
any
absolute
sense
we
do
not
wish
to
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
empirical
representations
which
shows
rational
ones
nor
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
individual
which
could
be
taken
as
a
sign
of
social
life
if
experience
were
completely
separated
from
all
that
is
rational
reason
could
not
operate
upon
it
in
the
same
way
if
the
psychic
nature
of
the
individual
were
absolutely
opposed
to
the
social
life
society
would
be
impossible
a
complete
analysis
of
the
categories
should
seek
these
germs
of
rationality
even
in
the
individual
consciousness
we
shall
have
occasion
to
come
back
to
this
point
in
our
conclusion
all
that
we
wish
to
establish
here
is
that
between
these
indistinct
germs
of
reason
and
the
reason
properly
so
called
there
is
a
difference
comparable
to
that
which
separates
the
properties
of
the
mineral
elements
out
of
which
a
living
being
is
composed
from
the
characteristic
attributes
of
life
after
this
has
once
been
constituted
it
has
frequently
been
remarked
that
social
disturbances
result
in
multiplying
mental
disturbances
this
is
one
more
proof
that
logical
discipline
is
a
special
aspect
of
social
discipline
the
first
gives
way
as
the
second
is
weakened
there
is
an
analogy
between
this
logical
necessity
and
moral
obligation
but
there
is
not
an
actual
identity
society
treats
criminals
in
a
different
fashion
than
subjects
whose
intelligence
only
is
abnormal
that
is
a
proof
that
the
authority
attached
to
logical
rules
and
that
inherent
in
moral
rules
are
not
of
the
same
nature
in
spite
of
certain
similarities
they
are
two
species
of
the
same
class
it
would
be
interesting
to
make
a
study
on
the
nature
and
origin
of
this
difference
which
is
probably
not
primitive
for
during
a
long
time
the
public
conscience
has
poorly
distinguished
between
the
deranged
and
the
delinquent
we
confine
ourselves
to
signalizing
this
question
by
this
example
one
may
see
the
number
of
problems
which
are
raised
by
the
analysis
of
these
notions
which
generally
pass
as
being
elementary
and
simple
but
which
are
really
of
an
extreme
complexity
this
question
will
be
treated
again
in
the
conclusion
of
this
work
the
rationalism
which
is
imminent
in
the
sociological
theory
of
knowledge
is
thus
midway
between
the
classical
empiricism
and
apriorism
for
the
first
the
categories
are
purely
artificial
constructions
for
the
second
on
the
contrary
they
are
given
by
nature
for
us
they
are
in
a
sense
a
work
of
art
but
of
an
art
which
imitates
nature
with
a
perfection
capable
of
increasing
unlimitedly
for
example
that
which
is
at
the
foundation
of
the
category
of
time
is
the
rhythm
of
social
life
but
if
there
is
a
rhythm
in
collective
life
one
may
rest
assured
that
there
is
another
in
the
life
of
the
individual
and
more
generally
in
that
of
the
universe
the
first
is
merely
more
marked
and
apparent
than
the
others
in
the
same
way
we
shall
see
that
the
notion
of
class
is
founded
on
that
of
the
human
group
but
if
men
form
natural
groups
it
can
be
assumed
that
among
things
there
exists
groups
which
are
at
once
analogous
and
different
classes
and
species
are
natural
groups
of
things
if
it
seems
to
many
minds
that
a
social
origin
can
not
be
attributed
to
the
categories
without
depriving
them
of
all
speculative
value
it
is
because
society
is
still
too
frequently
regarded
as
something
that
is
not
natural
hence
it
is
concluded
that
the
representations
which
express
it
express
nothing
in
nature
but
the
conclusion
is
not
worth
more
than
the
premise
this
is
how
it
is
legitimate
to
compare
the
categories
to
tools
for
on
its
side
a
tool
is
material
accumulated
capital
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
the
three
ideas
of
tool
category
and
institution
we
have
already
attempted
to
define
religious
phenomena
in
a
paper
which
was
published
in
the
vol
ii
pp
the
definition
then
given
differs
as
will
be
seen
from
the
one
we
give
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
we
shall
explain
the
reasons
which
have
led
us
to
these
modifications
but
which
imply
no
essential
change
in
the
conception
of
the
facts
see
above
we
shall
say
nothing
more
upon
the
necessity
of
these
preliminary
definitions

pp
also
in
thus
distinguishing
magic
from
religion
we
do
not
mean
to
establish
a
break
of
continuity
between
them

frontiers
between
the
two
domains

uncertain

this
is
the
conclusion
reached
by
spencer
in
his
ch
xvi
and
by
sabatier
in
his
of
a
philosophy
of
religion
based
on
psychology
and

and
by
all
the
school
to
which
he
belongs
notably
among

indian
tribes
of

america
this
statement
of
fact
does
not
touch
the
question
whether
exterior
and
public
religion
is
not
merely
the
development
of
an
interior
and
personal
religion
which
was
the
primitive
fact
or
whether
on
the
contrary
the
second
is
not
the
projection
of
the
first
into
individual
consciences
the
problem
will
be
directly
attacked
below
bk
ii
ch
v
cf
the
same
book
ch
vi
and
vii
for
the
moment
we
confine
ourselves
to
remarking
that
the
individual
cult
is
presented
to
the
observer
as
an
element
of
and
something
dependent
upon
the
collective
cult
it
is
by
this
that
our
present
definition
is
connected
to
the
one
we
have
already
proposed
in
the
in
this
other
work
we
defined
religious
beliefs
exclusively
by
their
obligatory
character
but
as
we
shall
show
this
obligation
evidently
comes
from
the
fact
that
these
beliefs
are
the
possession
of
a
group
which
imposes
them
upon
its
members
the
two
definitions
are
thus
in
a
large
part
the
same
if
we
have
thought
it
best
to
propose
a
new
one
it
is
because
the
first
was
too
formal
and
neglected
the
contents
of
the
religious
representations
too
much
it
will
be
seen
in
the
discussions
which
follow
how
important
it
is
to
put
this
characteristic
into
evidence
at
once
moreover
if
their
imperative
character
is
really
a
distinctive
trait
of
religious
beliefs
it
allows
of
an
infinite
number
of
degrees
consequently
there
are
even
cases
where
it
is
not
easily
perceptible
hence
come
difficulties
and
embarrassments
which
are
avoided
by
substituting
for
this
criterium
the
one
we
now
employ
we
thus
leave
aside
here
those
theories
which
in
whole
or
in
part
make
use
of
data
this
is
the
case
with
the
theory
which
andrew
lang
exposed
in
his
book
making
of
and
which
father
schmidt
has
taken
up
again
with
variations
of
detail
in
a
series
of
articles
on
origin
of
the
idea
of
lang
does
not
set
animism
definitely
aside
but
in
the
last
analysis
he
admits
a
sense
or
intuition
of
the
divine
directly
also
if
we
do
not
consider
it
necessary
to
expose
and
discuss
this
conception
in
the
present
chapter
we
do
not
intend
to
pass
it
over
in
silence
we
shall
come
to
it
again
below
when
we
shall
ourselves
explain
the
facts
upon
which
it
is
founded

case

conceptions

the
origin
of

imply
that
men
in

the
term
existed

was

there
is
no

term

tylor
says
that
their
sleeping
hours
are
characterized
by
almost
as
much
intercourse
with
the
dead
as
their

in

the

cites
this
remark
of

observer
their

construed
into
visits
from
the
spirits
of
their
deceased
friends
this
statement
is
certainly
exaggerated
but
it
is
one
more
proof
of
the
frequency
of
mystic
dreams
among
the
primitives
the
etymology
which
strehlow
proposes
for
the
arunta
word
which
means
to
dream
also
tends
to
confirm
this
theory
this
word
is
composed
of
which
strehlow
translates
by
god
and
which
means

thus
a
dream
would
be
the
moment
when

andrew
lang
who
also
refuses
to
admit
that
the
idea
of
the
soul
was
suggested
to
men
by
their
dream
experiences
believes
that
he
can
derive
it
from
other
empirical
data
these
are
the
data
of
spiritualism
telepathy
we
do
not
consider
it
necessary
to
discuss
the
theory
such
as
it
has
been
exposed
in
his
book
making
of
it
reposes
upon
the
hypothesis
that
spiritualism
is
a
fact
of
constant
observation
and
that
is
a
real
faculty
of
men
or
at
least
of
certain
men
but
it
is
well
known
how
much
this
theory
is
scientifically
contested
what
is
still
more
contestable
is
that
the
facts
of
spiritualism
are
apparent
enough
and
of
a
sufficient
frequency
to
have
been
able
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
all
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
which
are
connected
with
souls
and
spirits
the
examination
of
these
questions
would
carry
us
too
far
from
what
is
the
object
of
our
study
it
is
still
less
necessary
to
engage
ourselves
in
this
examination
since
the
theory
of
lang
remains
open
to
many
of
the
objections
which
we
shall
address
to
that
of
tylor
in
the
paragraphs
which
follow
jevons
has
made
a
similar
remark
with
tylor
he
admits
that
the
idea
of
the
soul
comes
from
dreams
and
that
after
it
was
created
men
projected
it
into
things
but
he
adds
the
fact
that
nature
has
been
conceived
as
animated
like
men
does
not
explain
how
it
became
the
object
of
a
cult
the
man
who
believes
the
bowing
tree
or
the
leaping
flame
to
be
a
living
thing
like
himself
does
not
therefore
believe
it
to
be
a
supernatural
being
rather
so
far
as
it
is
like
himself
it
like
himself
is
not
supernatural
to
the
history

this
is

however
according
to
spencer
there
is
a
germ
of
truth
in
the
belief
in
spirits
this
is
the
idea
that
the
power
which
manifests
itself
inside
the
consciousness
is
a
different
form
of
power
from
that
manifested
outside
the
consciousness
spencer
understands
by
this
that
the
notion
of
force
in
general
is
the
sentiment
of
the
force
which
we
have
extended
to
the
entire
universe
this
is
what
animism
admits
implicitly
when
it
peoples
nature
with
spirits
analogous
to
our
own
but
even
if
this
hypothesis
in
regard
to
the
way
in
which
the
idea
of
force
is
formed
were
true
and
it
requires
important
reservations
which
we
shall
make
bk
iii
ch
iii
it
has
nothing
religious
about
it
it
belongs
to
no
cult
it
thus
remains
that
the
system
of
religious
symbols
and
rites
the
classification
of
things
into
sacred
and
profane
all
that
which
is
really
religious
in
religion
corresponds
to
nothing
in
reality
also
this
germ
of
truth
of
which
he
speaks
is
still
more
a
germ
of
error
for
if
it
be
true
that
the
forces
of
nature
and
those
of
the
mind
are
related
they
are
profoundly
distinct
and
one
exposes
himself
to
grave
misconceptions
in
identifying
them
this
is
undoubtedly
what
explains
the
sympathy
which
like
mannhardt
have
felt
for
animistic
ideas
in
popular
religions
as
in
inferior
religions
these
spiritual
beings
of

the

max

goes
so
far

to
say

this
explanation
is
not
as
good
as
that
of
tylor
according
to
max
müller
men
could
not
admit
that
life
stopped
with
death
therefore
they
concluded
that
there
were
two
beings
within
them
one
of
which
survived
the
body
but
it
is
hard
to
see
what
made
them
think
that
life
continued
after
the
body
was
decomposed
for
the
details
see
pp
ff
p
this
is
what
keeps
max
müller
from
considering
christianity
the
climax
of
all
this
development
the
religion
of
ancestors
he
says
supposes
that
there
is
something
divine
in
man
now
is
that
idea
not
the
one
at
the
basis
of
the
teaching
of
christ
pp
it
is
useless
to
insist
upon
the
strangeness
of
the
conception
which
makes
christianity
the
latest
of
the
cults
of
the
dead

in
this
category
are
a
large
number
of
the
maxims
of
popular
wisdom
it
is
true
that
this
argument
does
not
touch
those
who
see
in
religion
a
code
especially
of
hygiene
whose
provisions
though
placed
under
the
sanction
of
imaginary
beings
are
nevertheless
well
founded
but
we
shall
not
delay
to
discuss
a
conception
so
insupportable
and
which
has
in
fact
never
been
sustained
in
a
systematic
manner
by
persons
somewhat
informed
upon
the
history
of
religions
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
good
the
terrible
practices
of
the
initiation
bring
to
the
health
which
they
threaten
what
good
the
dietetic
restrictions
which
generally
deal
with
perfectly
clean
animals
have
hygienically
how
sacrifices
which
take
place
far
from
a
house
make
it
more
solid
etc
undoubtedly
there
are
religious
precepts
which
at
the
same
time
have
a
practical
utility
but
they
are
lost
in
the
mass
of
others
and
even
the
services
which
they
render
are
frequently
not
without
some
drawbacks
if
there
is
a
religiously
enforced
cleanliness
there
is
also
a
religious
filthiness
which
is
derived
from
these
same
principles
the
rule
which
orders
a
corpse
to
be
carried
away
from
the
camp
because
it
is
the
seat
of
a
dreaded
spirit
is
undoubtedly
useful
but
the
same
belief
requires
the
relatives
to
anoint
themselves
with
the
liquids
which
issue
from
a
corpse
in
putrefaction
because
they
are
supposed
to
have
exceptional
from
this
point
of
view
magic
has
served
a
great
deal
more
than
religion
to
the
science
of

pp
on
the
science
of
ii
ff
pp
also
bréal
to
bring
the
necessary
clarity
into
this
question
of
the
origin
of
mythology
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
carefully
the
which
are
the
immediate
product
of
the
human
intelligence
from
the
which
are
its
indirect
and
involuntary
product
max
müller
recognized
this
see
and
the
gods
are
and
not
names
without
being
and
not
beings
without
name
it
is
true
that
max
müller
held
that
for
the
greeks
zeus
was
and
remained
in
spite
of
all
mythological
obscurations
the
name
of
the
supreme
deity
of
ii
we
shall
not
dispute
this
assertion
though
it
is
historically
contestable
but
in
any
case
this
conception
of
zeus
could
never
have
been
more
than
a
glimmer
in
the
midst
of
all
the
other
religious
beliefs
of
the
greeks
besides
this
in
a
later
work
max
müller
went
so
far
as
to
make
even
the
notion
of
god
in
general
the
product
of
a
wholly
verbal
process
and
thus
of
a
mythological
elaboration
undoubtedly
outside
the
real
myths
there
were
always
fables
which
were
not
believed
or
at
least
were
not
believed
in
the
same
way
and
to
the
same
degree
and
hence
had
no
religious
character
the
line
of
demarcation
between
fables
and
myths
is
certainly
floating
and
hard
to
determine
but
this
is
no
reason
for
making
all
myths
stories
any
more
than
we
should
dream
of
making
all
stories
myths
there
is
at
least
one
characteristic
which
in
a
number
of
cases
suffices
to
differentiate
the
religious
myth
that
is
its
relation
to
the
cult
see
above
more
than
that
in
the
language
of
max
müller
there
is
a
veritable
abuse
of
words
sensuous
experience
he
says
implies
at
least
in
certain
cases
beyond
the
known
unknown
something
which
i
claim
the
liberty
to
call
cf
the
unknown
is
not
necessarily
the
infinite
any
more
than
the
infinite
is
necessarily
the
unknown
if
it
is
in
all
points
the
same
and
consequently
like
the
part
which
we
know
it
would
be
necessary
to
prove
that
the
part
of
it
which
we
perceive
differs
in
nature
from
that
which
we
do
not
perceive
max
müller
involuntarily
recognizes
this
in
certain
passages
he
confesses
that
he
sees
little
difference
between
agni
the
god
of
fire
and
the
notion
of
ether
by
which
the
modern
physicist
explains
light
and
heat
pp
also
he
connects
the
notion
of
divinity
to
that
of
agency
or
of
a
causality
which
is
not
natural
and
profane
the
fact
that
religion
represents
the
causes
thus
imagined
under
the
form
of
personal
agents
is
not
enough
to
explain
how
they
got
a
sacred
character
a
personal
agent
can
be
profane
and
also
many
religious
forces
are
essentially
impersonal
we
shall
see
below
in
speaking
of
the
efficacy
of
rites
and
faith
how
these
illusions
are
to
be
explained

of
reproduced
without
any
essential
changes
it
is
true
that
at
the
end
and
at
the
beginning
there
are
some
general
theories
on
totemism
which
will
be
described
and
discussed
below
but
these
theories
are
relatively
independent
of
the
collection
of
facts
which
accompanies
them
for
they
had
already
been
published
in
different
articles
in
reviews
long
before
this
work
appeared
these
articles
are
reproduced
in
the
first
volume
pp
it
should
be
noted
that
in
this
connection
the
more
recent
work
and
shows
an
important
progress
in
the
thought
as
well
as
the
method
of
frazer
every
time
that
he
describes
the
religious
or
domestic
institutions
of
a
tribe
he
sets
himself
to
determine
the
geographic
and
social
conditions
in
which
this
tribe
is
placed
howsoever
summary
these
analyses
may
be
they
bear
witness
nevertheless
to
a
rupture
with
the
old
methods
of
the
anthropological
school
undoubtedly
we
also
consider
that
the
principal
object
of
the
science
of
religions
is
to
find
out
what
the
religious
nature
of
man
really
consists
in
however
as
we
do
not
regard
it
as
a
part
of
his
constitutional
but
rather
as
the
product
of
social
causes
we
consider
it
impossible
to
find
it
if
we
leave
aside
his
social
environment
we
can
not
repeat
too
frequently
that
the
importance
which
we
attach
to
totemism
is
absolutely
independent
of
whether
it
was
ever
universal
or
not
this
is
the
case
with
the
phratries
and
matrimonial
classes
on
this
point
see
spencer
and
gillen
ch
iii
howitt
pp
and
thomas
and
marriage
in
ch
vi
and
vii
du
travail
it
is
to
be
understood
that
this
is
not
always
the
case
it
frequently
happens
as
we
have
already
said
that
the
simpler
forms
aid
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
more
complex
on
this
point
there
is
no
rule
of
method
which
is
applicable
to
every
possible
case
thus
the
individual
totemism
of
america
will
aid
us
in
understanding
the
function
and
importance
of
that
in
australia
as
the
latter
is
very
rudimentary
it
would
probably
have
passed
unobserved
besides
there
is
not
one
unique
type
of
totemism
in
america
but
several
different
species
which
must
be
distinguished
we
shall
leave
this
field
only
very
exceptionally
and
when
a
particularly
instructive
comparison
seems
to
us
to
impose
itself
this
is
the
definition
given
by
cicero
sunt
qui
inter
se
eodem
nomine
those
are
of
the
same
gens
who
have
the
same
name
among
themselves
it
may
be
said
in
a
general
way
that
the
clan
is
a
family
group
where
kinship
results
solely
from
a
common
name
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
is
a
clan
but
the
totemic
clan
is
a
particular
sort
of
the
class
thus
constituted
in
a
certain
sense
these
bonds
of
solidarity
extend
even
beyond
the
frontiers
of
the
tribe
when
individuals
of
different
tribes
have
the
same
totem
they
have
peculiar
duties
towards
each
other
this
fact
is
expressly
stated
for
certain
tribes
of
north
america
see
frazer
and
iii
pp
the
texts
relative
to
australia
are
less
explicit
however
it
is
probable
that
the
prohibition
of
marriage
between
members
of
a
single
totem
is

morgan
in
australia
the
words
employed
differ
with
the

this
fortune
of
the
word
is
the
more
regrettable
since
we
do
not
even
know
exactly
how
it
is
written
some
write
others
or
or
see
frazer
nor
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
determined
exactly
according
to
the
report
of
the
first
observer
of
the
ojibway
j
long
the
word
designated
the
protecting
genius
the
individual
totem
of
which
we
shall
speak
below

and
not
the
totem
of
the
clan
but
the
accounts
of
other
explorers
say
exactly
the
contrary

this
point

is

be

of

puts
them
in

he
calls

these
are
taken
from
tribes
where
totemism
is
greatly
altered
such
as

that

he
mentions
a

totem

this
is
the
case
with
klaatsch
in
the
article
already
cited
see
above
as
we
indicated
in
the
preceding
chapter
totemism
is
at
the
same
time
of
interest
for
the
question
of
religion
and
that
of
the
family
for
the
clan
is
a
family
in
the
lower
societies
these
two
problems
are
very
closely
connected
but
both
are
so
complex
that
it
is
indispensable
to
treat
them
separately
also
the
primitive
family
organization
can
not
be
understood
before
the
primitive
religious
beliefs
are
known
for
the
latter
serve
as
the
basis
of
the
former
this
is
why
it
is
necessary
to
study
totemism
as
a
religion
before
studying
the
totemic
clan
as
a
family
group
see
taplin
narrinyeri
in
curr
ii
pp
howitt
pp
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
all
these
tribes
except
the
mara
and
the
anula
the
transmission
of
the
totem
in
the
paternal
line
is
only
a
general
rule
which
has
exceptions
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
nat
pp
ff
the
soul
of
the
ancestor
becomes
reincarnate
in
the
body
of
the
mother
and
becomes
the
soul
of
the
child
according
to
strehlow
ii
pp
ff
the
conception
though
being
the
work
of
the
ancestor
does
not
imply
any
reincarnation
but
in
neither
interpretation
does
the
totem
of
the
child
necessarily
depend
upon
that
of
the
parents
strehlow
ii
it
is
in
large
part
the
locality
where
the
mother
believes
that
she
conceived
which
determines
the
totem
of
the
child
each
totem
as
we
shall
see
has
its
centre
and
the
ancestors
preferably
frequent
the
places
serving
as
centres
for
their
respective
totems
the
totem
of
the
child
is
therefore
that
which
belongs
to
the
place
where
the
mother
believes
that
she
conceived
as
this
should
generally
be
in
the
vicinity
of
the
place
which
serves
as
totemic
centre
for
her
husband
the
child
should
generally
follow
the
totem
of
his
father
it
is
undoubtedly
this
which
explains
why
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
given
locality
belong
to
the
same
totem

to
bring
in
considerations
relative
to
the
organization

and
we
wish
to
keep
these
two
studies
separate
also
this
question
is
only
of
secondary
interest
to
our
subject
for
example
mukwara

is
the
name
of
a
phratry
among
the
barkinji
the
paruinji
and
the
milpulko
designates
the
according
to
brough

now
one
of
the
clans
of
this
phratry
has
the
as
totem
but
here
the
animal
is
designated
by
the
word
bilyara
many
cases
of
the
same
thing
are
cited
by
lang
spencer
and
gillen
according
to
howitt
pp
and
among
the
wotjobaluk
the
clan
of
the
pelican
is
found
in
the
two
phratries
equally
this
fact
seems
doubtful
to
us
it
is
very
possible
that
the
two
clans
may
have
two
varieties
of
pelicans
as
totems
information
given
by
mathews

the
same
tribe

to
point
to
this

and
especially
for

this
principle
is
not
maintained
everywhere
with
an
equal
strictness
in
the
central
tribes
of
eight
classes
notably
beside
the
class
with
which
marriage
is
regularly
permitted
there
is
another
with
which
a
sort
of
secondary
concubinage
is
allowed
spencer
and
gillen
it
is
the
same
with
certain
tribes
of
four
classes
each
class
has
a
choice
between
the
two
classes
of
the
other
phratry
this
is
the
case
with
the
kabi
see
mathews
curr
iii
see
roth
studies
among
the
queensland
pp
ff
palmer
on
some
australian
xiii
pp
ff
nevertheless
some
tribes
are
cited
where
the
matrimonial
classes
bear
the
names
of
animals
or
plants
this
is
the
case
with
the
kabi
mathew
representative
the
tribes
observed
by
bates
marriage
laws
and
customs
of
the
west
australian
in
geographical
and
perhaps
in
two
tribes
observed
by
palmer
but
these
facts
are
very
rare
and
their
significance
badly
established
also
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
classes
as
well
as
the
sexual
groups
should
sometimes
adopt
the
names
of
animals
this
exceptional
extension
of
the
totemic
denominations
in
no
way
modifies
our
conception
of
totemism
perhaps
the
same
explanation
is
applicable
to
certain
other
tribes
of
the
and
the
east
where
if
we
are
to
believe
the
informers
of
howitt
totems
specially
attached
to
each
matrimonial
class
are
to
be
found
this
is
the
case
among
the
wiradjuri
the
wakelbura
and
the
on
the
bulloo
river
howitt
pp
however
the
evidence
collected
is
suspect
according
to
his
own
admission
in
fact
it
appears
from
the
lists
which
he
has
drawn
up
that
many
totems
are
found
equally
in
the
two
classes
of
the
same
phratry
the
explanation
which
we
propose
after
frazer
and
pp
ff
raises
one
difficulty
in
principle
each
clan
and
consequently
each
totem
is
represented
equally
in
the
two
classes
of
a
single
phratry
since
one
of
the
classes
is
that
of
the
children
and
the
other
that
of
the
parents
from
whom
the
former
get
their
totems
so
when
the
clans
disappeared
the
totemic
interdictions
which
survived
should
have
remained
in
both
matrimonial
classes
while
in
the
actual
cases
cited
each
class
has
its
own
whence
comes
this
differentiation
the
example
of
the
kaiabara
a
tribe
of
southern
queensland
allows
us
to
see
how
it
may
have
come
about
in
this
tribe
the
children
have
the
totem
of
their
mother
but
it
is
particularized
by
some
distinctive
mark
if
the
mother
has
the
black
as
totem
the
child
has
the
white
howitt
this
appears
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
tendency
for
the
totems
to
differentiate
themselves
according
to
the
matrimonial
classes
a
tribe
of
only
a
few
hundred
members
frequently
has
fifty
or
sixty
clans
or
even
many
more

this
point

pp
ff
it
may
always
be
asked
whether
the
groups
which
have
these
totems
are
clans
or
see
the
tables

the
distinction
between
the
two
clans
is
absolute
in
every
respect
says
swanton
he
gives
the
name
clan
to
what
we
call
phratries
the
two
phratries
he
says
elsewhere
are
like
two
foreign
nations
in
their
relations
to
each
other
among
the
haida
at
least
the
totem
of
the
real
clans
is
altered
more
than
that
of
the
phratries
in
fact
usage
permits
a
clan
to
sell
or
give
away
the
right
of
bearing
its
totem
as
a
result
of
which
each
clan
has
a
number
of
totems
some
of
which
it
has
in
common
with
other
clans
see
swanton
pp
and
since
swanton
calls
the
phratries
clans
he
is
obliged
to
give
the
name
of
to
the
real
clans
and
of
to
the
regular
families

are
specially
studying
these
tattooings
are
put
on

animals
which
belong
to
the

the
bechuana
of

africa
are
divided
into
a
certain
number
of
clans
there
are
the
people
of

crocodile
the
buffalo
the
monkey
etc
now
the
crocodile
people
for
example
make
an
incision
in
the
ears
of
their
cattle
whose
form
is
like
the
jaws
of
this
animal
casalis
according
to
robertson
smith
the
same
custom
existed
among
the
ancient
arabs
and
marriage
in
early
pp
however
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
there
are
some
which
have
no
religious
sense
see

pp
among
the
arunta
this
rule
has
exceptions
which
will
be
explained
below

the
thing
thus
represented
is
not
always
the
totem
itself
but
one
of
those
things
which
being
associated
to
this
totem
are
regarded
as
being
in
the
same
family
of
things
this
is
the
case
for
example
among
the
warramunga
the
walpari
the
wulmala
the
tjingilli
the
umbaia
and
the
unmatjera
among
the
warramunga
at
the
moment
when
the
design
is
executed
the
performers
address
the
initiated
with
the
following
words
that
mark
belongs
to
your
place
do
not
look
out
along
another
place
this
means
say
spencer
and
gillen
that
the
young
man
must
not
interfere
with
ceremonies
belonging
to
other
totems
than
his
own
it
also
indicates
the
very
close
association
which
is
supposed
to
exist
between
a
man
and
his
totem
and
any
spot
especially
connected
with
the
totem
and
among
the
warramunga
the
totem
is
transmitted
from
father
to
child
so
each
locality
has
its
own
spencer
and
gillen
pp
it
will
be
remembered
see
above
that
in
this
tribe
the
child
may
have
a
different
totem
than
his
father
his
mother
or
his
relatives
in
general
now
the
relatives
on
both
sides
are
the
performers
designated
for
the
ceremonies
of
initiation
consequently
since
in
principle
a
man
can
have
the
quality
of
performer
or
officiant
only
for
the
ceremonies
of
his
own
totem
it
follows
that
in
certain
cases
the
rites
by
which
the
young
man
is
initiated
must
be
in
connection
with
a
totem
that
is
not
his
own
that
is
why
the
paintings
made
on
the
body
of
the
novice
do
not
necessarily
represent
his
own
totem
cases
of
this
sort
will
be
found
in
spencer
and
gillen
that
there
is
an
anomaly
here
is
well
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
circumcision
falls
to
the
totem
which
predominates
in
the
local
group
of
the
initiate
that
is
to
say
to
the
one
which
would
be
the
totem
of
the
initiate
himself
if
the
totemic
organization
were
not
disturbed
if
among
the
arunta
it
were
what
it
is
among
the
warramunga
see
spencer
and
gillen
the
same
disturbance
has
had
another
consequence
in
a
general
way
its
effect
is
to
extend
a
little
the
bonds
attaching
each
totem
to
a
special
group
since
each
totem
may
have
members
in
all
the
local
groups
possible
and
even
in
the
two
phratries
the
idea
that
these
ceremonies
of
a
totem
might
be
celebrated
by
an
individual
of
another
totem
an
idea
which
is
contrary
to
the
very
principles
of
totemism
as
we
shall
see
better
after
a
while
has
thus
been
accepted
without
too
much
resistance
it
has
been
admitted
that
a
man
to
whom
a
spirit
revealed
the
formula
for
a
ceremony
had
the
right
of
presiding
over
it
even
when
he
was
not
of
the
totem
in
question
himself
but
that
this
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
and
the
product
of
a
sort
of
toleration
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
beneficiary
of
the
formula
does
not
have
the
free
disposition
of
it
if
he
transmits
it
and
these
transmissions
are
frequent
it
can
be
only
to
a
member
of
the
totem
which
the
rite
concerns
in
this
case
the
novice
keeps
the
decoration
with
which
he
has
thus
been
adorned
until
it
disappears
of
itself
by
the
effect
of
time

says
that

there
and
put
to
death
we
find
some
difficulty
in
conciliating
this
fact
with
the
privilege
enjoyed
by
animals
and
ask
ourselves
if
the
rigour
with
which
a
criminal
is
treated
is
not
something
recent
and
should
not
be
attributed
to
a
weakening
of

distinguish
a

called

whose
functions
they
admit
they
have
been
unable
to
determine
they
merely
note
that
it
is
regarded
as
something
common
to
the
members
of
all
the
totems
according
to
strehlow
ii
the
kanana
of
which
spencer
and
gillen
speak
is
merely
the
nurtunja
of
the
wild
cat
totem
as
this
animal
is
the
object
of
a
tribal
cult

veneration
of

it
is
the
object
might
easily
be
common

third
it
is
true
that
there
is
only
one
sacred
post
for
the
tribe
while
there
is
a
nurtunja
for
each
clan
but
the
principle
is
the
same
pp
etc
etc
it
is
true
that
some
say
that
the
nurtunja
represents
the
lance
of
the
ancestor
who
was
at
the
head
of
each
clan
in
alcheringa
times
but
it
is
only
a
symbolic
representation
of
it
it
is
not
a
sort
of
relic
like
the
churinga
which
is
believed
to
come
from
the
ancestor
himself
here
the
secondary
character
of
the
explanation
is
very
noticeable
pp
esp
see
the
examples
given
in
spencer
and
gillen
fig
here
are
designs
many
of
which
evidently
have
the
object
of
representing
animals
plants
the
heads
of
men
though
of
course
all
are
very
conventional
ff
strehlow
ii
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
these
designs
and
paintings
also
have
an
æsthetic
character
here
is
the
first
form
of
art
since
they
are
also
and
even
above
all
a
written
language
it
follows
that
the
origins
of
design
and
those
of
writing
are
one
it
even
becomes
clear
that
men
commenced
designing
not
so
much
to
fix
upon
wood
or
stone

forms
which

the

cf

strehlow

pp
ff
see
above
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
these
myths
the
ancestors
are
never
represented
as
nourishing
themselves
with
their
totem
consumption
of
this
sort
is
on
the
contrary
the
exception
their
ordinary
food
according
to
strehlow
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
corresponding
animal
see
strehlow
i
also
this
whole
theory
rests
upon
an
entirely
arbitrary
hypothesis
spencer
and
gillen
as
well
as
frazer
admit
that
the
tribes
of
central
australia
and
especially
the
arunta
represent
the
most
archaic
and
consequently
the
purest
form
of
totemism
we
shall
presently
say
why
this
conjecture
seems
to
us
to
be
contrary
to
all
probability
it
is
even
probable
that
these
authors
would
not
have
accepted
their
thesis
so
readily
if
they
had
not
refused
to
regard
totemism
as
a
religion
and
if
they
had
not
consequently
misunderstood

character

pp
it
is
not
enough
that
the
intermediary
be
of
another
totem
as
we
shall
see
every
totem
of
a
phratry
is
forbidden
in
a
certain
measure
for
the
members
of
the
phratry
who
are
of
a
different
totem
we
can
now
explain
more
easily
how
it
happens
that
when
an
interdiction
is
not
observed
it
is
the
other
phratry
which
revenges
this
sacrilege
see
above
it
is
because
it
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
rule
is
observed
in
fact
they
believe
that
when
the
rule
is
broken
the
totemic
species
may
not
reproduce
abundantly
now
the
members
of
the
other
phratry
consume
it
regularly
therefore
it
is
they
who
are
affected
that
is
why
they
revenge
themselves

be
eaten
by

warramunga
or
a
walpari
but
only
when
offered
by
a
member
of
the
other
phratry
spencer
and
gillen
remark
that
in
this
regard
the
paternal
and
the
maternal
totems
appear
to
be
under
different
rules
it
is
true
that
in
both
cases
the
offer
must
come
from
the
other
phratry
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
paternal
totem
or
the
totem
properly
this
phratry
is
the
one
to
which
the
totem
does
not
belong
for
the
maternal
totem
the
contrary
is
the
case
probably
the
principle
was
first
established
for
the
former
then
mechanically
extended
to
the
other
though
the
situation
was
different
when
the
rule
had
once
become
established
that
the
prohibition
protecting
the
totem
could
be
neglected
only
on
the
invitation
of
the
other
phratry
it
was
applied
also
to
the
maternal
totem

example

not
kill

insect

it
bothers
him
he
must
confine
himself
to
driving
it
away

cf
taplin
among
the
kaitish

even
happens
that
in
certain
cases
an
old
man
gives
a
young
one
of

one
of
his
churinga

that
he
may

really
of

totemic
nature

many
of

have
no
direct
connection

facts

too
readily
and
in
this
regard
he
has
imitators
that
the
prohibitions
against
eating

touching
an
animal
depend
upon
totemic
beliefs
however
there
is
one
case
in
australia
where
the
sight
of
the
animal
seems
to
be
forbidden
according
to

it
very
long
or
he
would
be

to
die
at

of
an
enemy
but
we
believe
that
this
is
a
unique
case
we
must
not
forget
also
that
astronomical
totems
were
probably
not
primitive
in
australia
so
this
prohibition
may
be
the
product
of
a
complex
elaboration
this
hypothesis
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
among
the
euahlayi
looking
at
the
moon
is
forbidden
to
all
mothers
and
children
no
matter
what
their

perhaps
there
is
no
religion
which
makes
man
an
exclusively
profane
being
for
the
christian
the
soul
which
each
of
us
has
within
him
and
which
constitutes
the
very
essence
of
our
being
has
something
sacred
about
it
we
shall
see
that
this
conception
of
the
soul
is
as
old
as
religious
thought
itself
the
place
of
man
in
the
hierarchy
of
sacred
things
is
more
or
less
elevated

among
certain
clans
of

warramunga
for
example
among
the
urabunna
even
when
they
tell
us
that
the
first
beings
were
men
these
are
really
only
and
have
an
animal
nature
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
case
with
certain
unmatjera
pp
here
we
find
ways
of
thought
whose
confusion
disconcerts
us
but
which
must
be
accepted
as
they
are
we
would
denature
them
if
we
tried
to
introduce
a
clarity
that
is
foreign
to
them

undoubtedly
there
is
an
echo
of
the
initiation
rites
in
this
mythical
theme
the
initiation
also
has
the
object
of
making
the
young
man
into
a
complete
man
and
on
the
other
hand
it
also
implies
actual
surgical
operations
circumcision
the
extraction
of
teeth
the
processes
which
served
to
form
the
first

would
naturally
be
conceived
on

model

case

it
is
thus
that
the
turtle
clan
of
the
iroquois
took
form
a
group
of
turtles
had
been
forced
to
leave
the
lake
where
they
dwelt

seek
another

one
of
them
which
was
larger

the

stood
this
exercise
very
badly
owing
to
the
heat
it
made
such
violent
efforts
that
it
got
out
of
its
shell
the
process
of
transformation
being
once
commenced
went
on
by
itself
and
the
turtle
finally
became

for

here
is
a
legend
of
the
tsimshian
in
the
course

a
hunt
an
indian
met
a
black
bear
which
took
him
to
its
home
and
taught
him
to
catch
salmon
and
build
canoes
the
man
stayed
with
the
bear
for
two
years
and
then
returned
to
his
native
village
but
the
people
were
afraid
of
him
because
he
was
just
like
a
bear
he
could
not
talk
or
eat
anything
except
raw
food
then
he
was
rubbed
with
magic
herbs
and
gradually
regained
his
original
form
after
that
whenever
he
was
in
trouble
he
called
upon
his
bear
friends
who
came
to
aid
him
he
built
a
house
and
painted
a
bear
on
the
foundation
his
sister
made
a
blanket
for
the
dance
upon
which
a
bear
was
designed
that
is
why
the
descendants
of
this
sister
had
the
bear
as
their
emblem

thus
we
see
the
inconveniences
in
making
this
mystical
relationship

the

and
the
animal

distinctive
characteristic
of
totemism
as

this
relationship
is
a
mythical
representation
of
otherwise
profound
facts
but
it
may
be
omitted
without
causing
the
disappearance
of
the
essential
traits
of
totemism
undoubtedly
there
are
always
close
bonds
between
the
people
of
the
clan
and
the
totemic
animal
but
these
are
not
necessarily
bonds
of
though
they
are
frequently
conceived
in
this
form
there
are
also
some
tlinkit
myths
in
which
the
relationship
of
descent
between
the
man
and
the
animal
is
still
more
carefully
stated
it
is
said
that
the
clan
is
descended
from
a
mixed
union
if
we
may
so
speak
that
is
to
say
one
where
either
the
husband
or
the

this

it
is
an
ordinary
animal
to
be
hunted
and
eaten
but
it
is
also
a
supernatural
being
in

form
upon
which
men
depend
the
mythical
beings
corresponding

have

the

who
must

not
hesitate

this
hostility
is
carried
into
the
myths
the
two
animals
serving
the
phratries
as
totems
are
frequently
represented
as
in
a
perpetual
war
against

so
thomas
has
wrongly
urged
against
our
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
phratries
its
inability
to
explain
their
opposition
and
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
connect
this
opposition
to
that
of
the
profane
and
the
sacred

the

one
of
the
signs
of
this
primitive
lack

is
that
territorial
bases

sometimes

just
as
to
the
social
divisions
with
which
they
were
at

confounded

however
there
are
certain
tribes
in

where
the
things
thus
attributed
to
a
social
group
are
not
forbidden
for
the
members
of
the
group
this
is
notably
the
case
with
the
wakelbura
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
in
this
society
it
is
the
matrimonial
classes
that
serve
as
the
framework
of
the
classification
see

not

are
the

of

class
allowed

animals
attributed
to

may
eat

howitt
curr
iii
but
we
must
not
conclude
from
this
that
these
animals
are
considered
profane
in
fact
it
should
be
noticed
that
the
individual
not
only
has
the
privilege
of
eating
them
but
that
he
is
compelled
to
do
so
for
he
can
not
nourish
himself
otherwise
now
the
imperative
nature
of
this
rule
is
a
sure
sign
that
we
are
in
the
presence
of
things
having
a
religious
nature
only
this
has
given
rise
to
a
positive
obligation
rather
than
the
negative
one
known
as
an
interdiction
perhaps
it
is
not
quite
impossible
to
see
how
this
deviation
came
about
we
have
seen
above
that
every
individual
is
thought
to
have
a
sort
of
over
his
totem
and
consequently
over
the
things
dependent
upon
it
perhaps
under
the
influence
of
special
circumstances
this
aspect
of
the
totemic
relation
was
developed
and
they
naturally
came
to
believe
that
only
the
members
of
the
clan
had
the
right
of
disposing
of
their
totem
and
all
that
is
connected
with
it
and
that
others
on
the
contrary
did
not
have
the
right
of
touching
it
under
these
circumstances
a
tribe
could
nourish
itself
only
on
the
food
attributed
to
it
parker

expression

it
sometimes
happens
that
the
same
secondary
totems
are
attached
to
two
or
three
principal
totems
at
the
same
time
this
is
undoubtedly
because
strehlow
has
not
been
able
to
establish
with
certainty
which
is
the
principal
totem
two
interesting
facts
which
appear
from
this
table
confirm
certain
propositions
which
we
had
already
formulated
first
the
principal
totems
are
nearly
all
animals
with
but
rare
exceptions
also
stars
are
always
only
secondary
or
associated
totems
this
is
another
proof
that
these
latter
were
only
slowly
advanced
to
the
rank
of
totems
and
that
at
first
the
principal
totems
were
preferably
chosen
from
the
animal
kingdom
according
to
the
myth
the
associate
totems
served
as
food
to
the
men
of
the
principal
totem
in
the
fabulous
times
or
when
these
are
trees
they
gave
their
shade

the
fact
that
the
associate
totems
are
believed
to
have
been
eaten
does
not
imply
that
they
are
considered
profane
for
in
the
mythical
period
the
principal
totem
itself
was
consumed
by
the
ancestors
the
founders
of
the
clan
according
to
the
belief
thus
in
the
wild

clan
the
designs

the

about

one
might
even
ask
if
tribal
totems
do
not
exist
sometimes
thus
among

is
an
animal
the
wild
cat
which
serves
as
totem
to
a
particular
clan
but
which
is
forbidden
for
the
whole
tribe
even
the
people
of
other
clans
can
eat
it
only
very
moderately
but
we
believe
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
to
speak
of
a
tribal
totem
in
this
case
for
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
that
the
free
consumption
of
an
animal
is
forbidden
that
this
is
a
totem
other
causes
can
also
give
rise
to
an
interdiction
the
religious
unity
of
the

is
undoubtedly
real

the

commences
when

if

it
is
because
he
refuses
all
religious
character
to
the
totem
of
the

and
iii
see
below
chapter

of
this
book
yet
according
to
one
passage
in
mathews
the
individual
totem
is
hereditary
among
the
wotjobaluk
each
individual
he
says
claims
some
animal
plant
or
inanimate
object
as
his
special
and
personal
totem
which
he
inherits
from
his
mother
and
proc
of
the
roy
soc
of
xxxviii
but
it
is
evident
that
if
all
the
children
in
the
same
family
had
the
personal
totem
of
their
mother
neither
they
nor
she
would
really
have
personal
totems
at
all
mathews
probably
means
to
say
that
each
individual
chooses
his
individual
totem
from
the
list
of
things
attributed
to
the
clan
of
his
mother
in
fact
we
shall
see
that
each
clan
has
its
individual
totems
which
are
its
exclusive
property
the
members
of
the
other

can
not
make
use

and
a
personal
letter
by
the
same
author
cited
by

in

this
is
practically
the
solution
adopted
by
wundt
und
ii
it
is
true
that
according
to
tylor
theory
a
clan
is
only
an
enlarged
family
therefore
whatever
may
be
said
of
one
of
these
groups
is
in
his
theory
applicable
to
the
other
xxviii
but
this
conception
is
exceedingly
contestable
only
the
clan
presupposes
a
totem
which
has
its
whole
meaning
only
in
and
through
the
clan
for
this
same
conception
see
lang
see
above
ii
wundt
who
has
revived
the
theory
of
tylor
in
its
essential
lines
has
tried
to
explain
this
mysterious
relationship
of
the
man
and
the
animal
in
a
different
way
it
was
the
sight
of
the
corpse
in
decomposition
which
suggested
the
idea
when
they
saw
worms
coming
out
of
the
body
they
thought
that
the
soul
was
incarnate
in
them
and
escaped
with
them
worms
and
by
extension
reptiles
snakes
lizards
etc
were
therefore
the
first
animals
to
serve
as
receptacles
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
consequently
they
were
also
the
first
to
be
venerated
and
to
play
the
rôle
of
totems
it
was
only
subsequently
that
other
animals
and
plants
and
even
inanimate
objects
were
elevated
to
the
same
dignity
but
this
hypothesis
does
not
have
even
the
shadow
of
a
proof
wundt
affirms
und
ii
that
reptiles
are
much
more
common
totems
than
other
animals
from
this
he
concludes
that
they
are
the
most
primitive
but
we
can
not
see
what
justifies
this
assertion
in
the
support
of
which
the
author
cites
no
facts
the
lists
of
totems
gathered
either
in
australia
or
in
america
do
not
show
that
any
special
species
of
animal
has
played
a
preponderating
rôle
totems
vary
from
one
region
to
another
with
the
flora
and
fauna
moreover
if
the
circle
of
possible
totems
was
so
closely
limited
at
first
we
can
not
see
how
totemism
was
able
to
satisfy
the
fundamental
principle
which
says
that
the
two
clans
or
of
a
tribe
must
have
two
different
totems
sometimes
men
adore
certain
animals
says
tylor
because
they
regard
them
as
the
reincarnation
of
the
divine
souls
of
the
ancestors
this
belief
is
a
sort
of
bridge
between
the
cult
rendered
to
shades
and
that
rendered
to
animals

totemism

himself
if

i

john
a
member
of
another
clan
shoots
that
hare
roasts
and
swallows
it
what
becomes
of
my
soul
to
meet
this
obvious
danger
it
is
necessary
that
john
should
know
the
state
of
my
soul
and
that
knowing
it
he
should
whenever
he
shoots
a
hare
take
steps
to
extract
and
restore
to
me
my
soul
before
he
cooks
and
dines
upon
the
animal
now
frazer
believes
that
he
has
found
this
practice
in
use
in
central
australia
every
year
in
the
course
of
a
ceremony
which
we
shall
describe
presently
when
the
animals
of
the
new
generation
arrive
at
maturity
the
first
game
to
be
killed
is
presented
to
men
of
that
totem
who
eat
a
little
of
it
and
it
is
only
after
this
that
the
men
of
the
other
clans
may
eat
it
freely
this
says
frazer
is
a
way
of
returning
to
the
former
the
souls
they
may
have
confided
to
these
animals
but
aside
from
the
fact
that
this
interpretation
of
the
fact
is
wholly
arbitrary
it
is
hard
not
to
find
this
way
of
escaping
the
danger
rather
peculiar
this
ceremony
is
annual
long
days
may
have
elapsed
since
the
animal
was
killed
during
all
this
time
what
has
become
of
the
soul
which
it
sheltered
and
the
individual
whose
life
depended
on
this
soul

it
is

the
proper
names
of
the
says
boas
in
regard
to
the
tlinkit
are
derived
from
their
respective
totems
each
gens
having
its
special
names
the
connection
between
the
name
and
the
collective
totem
is
not
very
apparent
sometimes
but
it
always
exists
of
the
committee
the
fact
that
individual
forenames
are
the
property
of
the
clan
and
characterize
it
as
surely
as
the
totem
is
also
found
among
the
iroquois
morgan
the
wyandot
powell
in
the
shawnee
sauk
and
fox
morgan
pp
and
the
omaha
dorsey
in
pp
now
the
relation
between
forenames
and
personal
totems
is
already
known
see
above
for
example
says
mathews
if
you
ask
a
wartwurt
man
what
totem
he
is
he
will
first
tell
his
personal
totem
and
will
probably
then
enumerate
those
of
his
clan
of
the
roy

xxxviii
beginnings
of
religion
and
totemism
among
the
australian

and
cf
the
same

origin
of
april
and
may
these
latter
articles
being
slightly
older
differ
from
the
former
on
one
point
but
the
foundation
of
the
theory
is
not
essentially
different
both
are
reproduced
in

in
the
same
sense
see

on
totemism
as
applied
to
australian

and
the
remarks
of
frazer
on
the
same
subject
pp
perhaps
we
may
say
that
it
is
but
one
remove
from
the
original
pattern
the
absolutely
original
form
of
totemism
on
this
point
the
testimony
of
strehlow
ii
confirms
that
of
spencer
and
gillen
for
a
contrary
opinion
see
lang
secret
of
the
a
very
similar
idea
had
already
been
expressed
by
haddon
in
his
to
the
anthropological
pp
he
supposes
that
at
first
each
local
group
had
some
food
which
was
especially
its
own
the
plant
or
animal
thus
serving
as
the
principal
item
of
food
became
the
totem
of
the
group
all
these
explanations
naturally
imply
that
the
prohibitions
against
eating
the
totemic
animal
were
not
primitive
but
were
even
preceded
by
a
contrary
prescription
may
and
july

though
considering
totemism

a
system
of
magic
frazer
recognizes
that
the
first
germs
of
a
real
religion
are
sometimes
found
in
it

the
way

frazer
says
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
a

still
more
ancient
than
that
of
the
arunta
it
is
the
one
observed
by
rivers
in
the
banks

in
polynesia
and
in

among
the
arunta
it
is
the
spirit
of
an
ancestor
who
is
believed
to
impregnate
the
mother
in
the
banks

it
is
the
spirit
of
an
animal

as
the
theory
supposes
but
as
the
ancestral
spirits
of

arunta
have
an
animal

form
the
difference
is
slight
therefore
we

not

it

to
reproduce

however
we
have
not
spoken
of
the

but
this
is
because
it
is
only
a
part
of
his
general
theory
of
the
transformation
of

the

we
have
described

already

that

we
have
already
said
he
believes
that
this
is
due
to
a
sort
of
primitive
revelation
but
lang
does
not
make
use
of
this
idea
in
his
explanation
of
totemism
for

pierces

it
is
true
that
we
have
charged
frazer
with
not
being
critical
enough
in
the
choice
of
his
examples

many
examples
would
obviously
have
been
impossible

which
really
have
a
more
precise
signification
miss
fletcher
while
recognizing
no

clearly
the
impersonal
character
of
the
wakanda
adds
nevertheless
that
a
certain
anthropomorphism
has
attached
to
this
conception
but
this
anthropomorphism
concerns
the
various
manifestations

the
wakanda

they
think

perceive

quoted
by

we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
in
principle
every
representation
of
religious
forces
in
an
animal
form
is
an
index
of
former
totemism
but
when
we
are
dealing
with
societies
where
totemism
is
still
apparent
as
is
the
case
with
the
dakota
it
is
quite
natural
to
think
that
these
conceptions
are
not
foreign
to
it
see
below
same
book
ch
ix
pp
ff
the
first
spelling
is
that
of
spencer
and
gillen
the
second
that
of
strehlow
it
is
true
that
spencer
and
gillen
add
the
idea
can
be
best
expressed
by
saying
that
an
arungquiltha
object
is
possessed
of
an
evil
spirit
but
this
free
translation
of
spencer
and
gillen
is
their
own
unjustified
interpretation
the
idea
of
the
arungquiltha
in
no
way
implies
the
existence
of
spiritual
beings
as
is
shown
by
the
context
and
strehlow
definition
ii
under
the
name
see
grey
of

ii
pp
see
above
spencer
and
gillen
recognize
this
implicitly
when
they
say
that
the
arungquiltha
is
a
supernatural
force
cf
hubert
and
mauss
générale
de
la
in

pp

hewitt
there
is
even
ground
for
asking
whether
an
analogous
notion
is
completely
lacking
in
australia
the
word
churinga
or
tjurunga
as
strehlow
writes
has
a
very
great
similarity
with
the
arunta
spencer
and
gillen
say
that
it
designates
all
that
is
secret
or
sacred
it
is
applied
both
to
the
object
and
to
the
quality
it
possesses
churinga
this
is
almost
a
definition
of
mana
sometimes
spencer
and
gillen
even
use
this
word
to
designate
religious
power
or
force
in
a
general
way
while
describing
a
ceremony
among
the
kaitish
they
say
that
the
officiant
is
of
that
is
to
say
they
continue
of
the
magic
power
emanating
from
the
objects
called
churinga
yet
it
does
not
seem
that
the
notion
of
churinga
has
the
same
clarity
and
precision
as
that
of
the
mana
in
melanesia
or
of
the
wakan
among
the
sioux
yet
we
shall
see
below
this
book
ch
viii
and
ix
that
totemism
is
not
foreign
to
all
ideas
of
a
mythical
personality
but
we
shall
show
that
these
conceptions
are
the
product
of
secondary
formations
far
from
being
the
basis
of
the
beliefs
we
have
just
analysed
they
are
derived
from
them

clearly
opposes
them
to
all
influences
of
a
profane
nature
lxxxvi
it
is
found
even
in
the
recent
theories
of
frazer
for
if
this
scholar
denies
to
totemism
all
religious
character
in
order
to
make
it
a
sort
of
magic
it
is
just
because
the
forces
which
the
totemic
cult
puts
into
play
are
impersonal
like
those
employed
by
the
magician
so
frazer
recognizes
the
fundamental
fact
which
we
have
just
established
but
he
draws
different
conclusions
because
he
recognizes
religion
only
where
there
are
mythical
personalities
however
we
do
not
take
this
word
in
the
same
sense
as
preuss
and
marrett
according
to
them
there
was
a
time
in
religious
evolution
when
men
knew
neither
souls
nor
spirits

phase
but
this
hypothesis
is
very
questionable
we
shall

point

pickler
in
the
little
work
above
mentioned
had
already
expressed
in
a
slightly
dialectical
manner
the
sentiment
that
this
is
what
the
totem
essentially
is
see
our
du

pp
ff
this
is
the
case
at
least
with
all
moral
authority
recognized
as
such
by
the
group
as
a
whole
we
hope
that
this
analysis
and
those
which
follow
will
put
an
end
to
an
inexact
interpretation
of
our
thought
from
which
more
than
one
misunderstanding
has
resulted
since
we
have
made
constraint
the
by
which
social
facts
can
be
the
most
easily
recognized
and
distinguished
from
the
facts
of
individual
psychology
it
has
been
assumed
that
according
to
our
opinion
physical
constraint
is
the
essential
thing
for
social
life
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
never
considered
it
more
than
the
material
and
apparent
expression
of
an
interior
and
profound
fact
which
is
wholly
ideal
this
is
the
problem
of
sociology
if
we
can
speak
of
sociological
problem
consists
in
seeking
among
the
different
forms
of
external
constraint
the
different
sorts
of
moral
authority
corresponding
to
them
and
in
discovering
the
causes
which
have
determined
these
latter
the
particular
question
which
we
are
treating
in
this
present
work
has
as
its
principal
object
the
discovery
of
the
form
under
which
that
particular
variety
of
moral
authority
which
is
inherent
in
all
that
is
religious
has
been
born
and
out
of
what
elements
it
is
made
it
will
be
seen
presently
that
even
if
we
do
make
social
pressure
one
of
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
sociological
phenomena
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
is
the
only
one
we
shall
show
another
aspect
of
the
collective
life
nearly
opposite
to
the
preceding
one
but
none
the
less
real
see
of
course
this
does
not
mean
to
say
that
the
collective
consciousness
does
not
have
distinctive
characteristics
of
its
own
on
this
point
see
individuelles
et
représentations
in

this
is
proved
by
the
length
and
passionate
character
of
the
debates

a
legal
form
was
given
to
the
resolutions
made
in
a

found
in

rite
cf
pp
thus
we
see
that
this
fraternity
is
the
logical
consequence
of
totemism
rather
than
its
basis
men
have
not
imagined
their
duties
towards
the
animals
of
the
totemic
species
because
they
regarded
them
as
kindred
but
have
imagined
the
kinship
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
beliefs
and
rites
of
which
they
were
the
object
the
animal
was
considered
a
relative
of
the
man
because
it
was
a
sacred
being
like
the
man
but
it
was
not
treated
as
a
sacred
being
because
it
was
regarded
as
a
relative
see

ch

at
the
bottom
of
this
conception
there
is
a
and
persistent
sentiment
modern
science
also
tends
more
and
more
to
admit
that
the
duality
of
man
and
nature
does
not
exclude
their
unity
and
that
physical
and
moral
forces
though
distinct
are
closely
related
we
undoubtedly
have
a
different
conception
of
this
unity
and
relationship
than
the
primitive
but
beneath
these
different
symbols
the
truth
affirmed
by
the
two
is
the
same
we
say
that
this
derivation
is
sometimes
indirect
on
account
of
the
industrial
methods
which
in
a
large
number
of
cases
seem
to
be
derived
from
religion
through
the
intermediacy
of
magic

for
as
we
believe
magic
forces
are
only
a
special
form
of

point
several

after

is

adult

fully

the

rites
introducing
the

themselves

we
provisionally
limit
ourselves
to
this
general
indication
we
shall
return
to
this
idea

thus
we
see
how
erroneous
those
theories
are
which
like
the
geographical
materialism
of
ratzel
see
especially
his
seek
to
derive
all
social
life
from
its
material
foundation
either
economic
or
territorial
they
commit
an
error
precisely
similar
to
the
one
committed
by
maudsley
in
individual
psychology
just
as
this
latter
reduced
all
the
psychical
life
of
the
individual
to
a
mere
epiphenomenon
of
his
physiological
basis
they
seek
to
reduce
the
whole
psychical
life
of
the
group
to
its
physical
basis
but
they
forget
that
ideas
are
realities
and
forces
and
that
collective
representations
are
forces
even
more
powerful
and
active
than
individual
representations

the

the

a
relatively
advanced

to
make
sure
of
this
it
is
sufficient
to
look
at
the
chart
arranged
by
thomas

in
to
appreciate
this
chart
properly
it
should
be
remembered
that
the

has
extended
for
a
reason
unknown
to
us
the
system
of
totemic
filiation
in
the
paternal
line
clear
to
the
western
coast
of
australia
though
we
have
almost
no
information
about
the
tribes
of
this
region
which
is
moreover
largely
a
desert
the
stars
are
often
regarded
even
by
the
australians
as
the
land
of
souls
and
mythical
personages
as
will
be
established
in
the
next
chapter
that
means
that
they
pass
as
being
a
very
different
world
from
that
of
the
living
i
cf

of
course
it
is
to
be
understood
that
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
see
above
this
choice
was
not
made
without
a
more
or
less
formal
agreement
between
the
groups
that
each
should
take
a
different
emblem
from
its
neighbours
the
mental

ourselves
to
adding
certain
explanations
showing
in
what
we
differ
from
in
our
understanding
of
the
facts
see
above
another
cause
has
contributed
much
to
this
fusion
this
is
the
extreme
contagiousness
of
religious
forces
they
seize
upon
every
object
within
their
reach
whatever
it
may
be
thus
a
single
religious
force
may
animate
the
most
diverse
things
which
by
that
very
fact
become
closely
connected
and
classified
within
a
single
group
we
shall
return
again
to
this
contagiousness
when
we
shall
show
that
it
comes
from
the
social
origins
of
the
idea
of
sacredness

this
is
the
case
with

gnanji
see

cf
a
similar
case
in
brough

there
certainly
was
a
time
when
the
gnanji
women
had
souls
for
a
large
number
of
women
souls
still
exist
however
they
never
reincarnate
themselves
since
in
this
tribe
the
soul
animating
a
child
is
an
old
reincarnated
soul
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
women
souls
do
not
reincarnate
themselves
that
women
can
not
have
a
soul
moreover
it
is
possible
to
explain
whence
this
absence
of
reincarnation
comes
filiation
among
the
gnanji
after
having
been
uterine
is
now
in
the
paternal
line
a
mother
no
longer
transmits
her
totem
to
her
child
so
the
woman
no
longer
has
any
descendants
to
perpetuate
her
she
is
the
familiæ
to
explain
this
situation
there
are
only
two
possible
hypotheses
either
women
have
no
souls
or
else
they
are
destroyed
after
death
the
gnanji
have
adopted
the
former
of
these
two
explanations
certain
peoples
of
queensland
have
preferred
the
latter
see

and
in
queensland
no
the
children
below
four
or
five
years
of
age
have
neither
soul
nor
future
life
says
dawson
but
the
fact
he
thus
relates
is
merely
the
absence
of
funeral

for

strehlow
even
goes
so
far

to
say

sexual
relations
are
not
even
thought
to
be
a
necessary
condition
or
sort
of
preparation
for
conception

it
is
true
that
he
adds
a
few
lines
below
that
the
old

know
perfectly
well
the
connection
which
unites
sexual
intercourse
and
generation
and
that
as
far
as
animals
are
concerned
the
children
themselves
know
it
this
lessens
the
value
of
his
first
assertion
a
little
in
general
we
employ
the
terminology
of
spencer
and
gillen
rather
than
that
of
strehlow
because
it
is
now
consecrated
by
long
usage
pp
i
means
eternal
according
to
strehlow
among
the
loritja
only
rocks
fulfil
this
function
strehlow
translates
it
by
it
is
not
true
that
spencer
and
gillen
have
ignored
the
myth
of
the
and
the
customs
connected
with
it
they
explicitly
mention
it
in
pp
ff
and
they
noticed
at
different
points
of
the
arunta
territory
the
existence
of
rocks
called
from
which
the
or
the
children
souls
disengage
themselves
to
enter
the
bodies
of
women
and
fertilize
them
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
means
child
though
as
they
add
it
is
rarely
used
in
this
sense
in
ordinary
conversation
the
arunta
are
divided
into
four
or
eight
matrimonial
classes
the
class
of
a
child
is
determined
by
that
of
his
father
inversely
that
of
the
latter
may
be
deduced
from
the
former
see
spencer

gillen
pp

pp
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
the
ratapa
has
a
matrimonial
class
we
shall
return
to
this
point
again
strehlow
ii
it
happens
sometimes
though
rarely
that
disputes
arise
over
the
nature
of
the
child
totem
strehlow
cites
such
a
case
ii
this
is
the
same
word
as
the
found
in
spencer
and
gillen
strehlow
ii
strehlow
ii
mathews
attributes
a
similar
theory
of
conception
to
the
tjingilli
chingalee
roy
geogr
trans
and
soc
xxii
pp
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
ancestor
who
is
believed
to
have
thrown
the
namatuna
shows
himself
to
the
woman
in
the
form
of
an
animal
or
a
man
this
is
one
more
proof
of
the
affinity
of
the
ancestral
soul
for
a
material
form
schulze
this
results
from
the
fact
that
the
ratapa
can
incarnate
itself
only
in
the
body
of
a
woman
belonging
to
the
same
matrimonial
class
as
the
mother
of
the
mythical
ancestor
so
we
can
not
understand
how
strehlow
could
say
i
that
except
in
one
case
the
myths
do
not
attribute
determined
matrimonial
classes
to
the
alcheringa
ancestors
his
own
theory
of
conception
proves
the
contrary
cf
ii
pp
strehlow
ii
the
difference
between
the
two
versions
becomes
still
smaller
and
is
reduced
to
almost
nothing
if
we
observe
that
when
spencer
and
gillen
tell
us
that
the
ancestral
soul
is
incarnated
in
the
woman
the
expressions
they
use
are
not
to
be
taken
literally
it
is
not
the
whole
soul
which
comes
to
fertilize
the
mother
but
only
an
emanation
from
this
soul
in
fact
according
to
their
own
statement
a
soul
equal
or
even
superior
in
power
to
the
one
that
is
incarnated
continues
to
live
in
the
nanja
tree
or
rock
see
we
shall
have
occasion
to
come
back
to
this
point
again
cf
below
ii
pp
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
the
churinga
is
not
the
soul
of
the
ancestor
but
the
object
in
which
his
soul
resides
at
bottom
these
two
mythological
interpretations
are
identical
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
one
has
been
able
to
pass
into
the
other
the
body
is
the
place
where
the
soul
resides
strehlow
i
strehlow
i
pp
in
these
stories
the
ancestor
begins
by
introducing
himself
into
the
body
of
the
woman
and
causing
there
the
troubles
characteristic
of
pregnancy
then
he
goes
out
and
only
then
does
he
leave
his
namatuna
strehlow
ii
this
is
the
word
for
word
translation
of
the
terms
employed
as
strehlow
gives
them

dies
du
der
in
the
myth
a
civilizing
hero
mangarkunjerkunja
says
as
he
presents
to
each
man
the
churinga
of
his
ancestor
you
are
born
of
this
churinga
strehlow
ii
strehlow
at
bottom
the
only
real
difference
between
strehlow
and
spencer
and
gillen
is
the
following
one
for
these
latter
the
soul
of
the
individual
after
death
returns
to
the
nanja
tree
where
it
is
again
confounded
with
the
ancestor
soul
for
strehlow
it
goes
to
the
isle
of
the
dead
where
it
is
finally
annihilated
in
neither
myth
does
it
survive
individually
we
are
not
going
to
seek
the
cause
of
this
divergence
it
is
possible
that
there
has
been
an
error
of
observation
on
the
part
of
spencer
and
gillen
who
do
not
speak
of
the
isle
of
the
dead
it
is
also
possible
that
the
myth
is
not
the
same

it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
cases
where
the
soul
clearly
presents
itself
after
death
in
an
animal
form
all
come
from
the
societies
where
totemism
is
more
or
less
perverted
this
is
because
the
idea
of
the
soul
is
necessarily
ambiguous
wherever
the
totemic
beliefs
are
relatively
pure
for
totemism
implies
that
it
participate
in
the
two
kingdoms
at
the
same
time
so
it
can
not
become
either
one
or
the
other
exclusively
but
takes
one
aspect
or
the
other
according
to
the
circumstances
as
totemism
develops
this
ambiguity
becomes
less
necessary
while
at
the
same
time
spirits
more
actively
demand
attention
then
the
marked
affinities
of
the
soul
for
the
animal
kingdom
are
manifested
especially
after
it
is
freed
from
the
human
body
see
above
on
the
generality
of
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
see

pp
ff
even
if
we
believe
that
religious
and
moral
representations
constitute
the
essential
elements
of
the
idea
of
the
soul
still
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
are
the
only
ones
around
this
central
nucleus
are
grouped
other
states
of
consciousness
having
this
same
character
though
to
a
slighter
degree
this
is
the
case
with
all
the
superior
forms
of
the
intellectual
life
owing
to
the
special
price
and
dignity
attributed
to
them
by
society
when
we
devote
our
lives
to
science
or
art
we
feel
that
we
are
moving
in
a
circle
of
things
that
are
above
bodily
sensations
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
show
more
precisely
in
our
conclusion
this
is
why
the
highest
functions
of
the
intelligence
have
always
been
considered
specific
manifestations
of
the
soul
but
they
would
probably
not
have
been
enough
to
establish
the
idea
of
it
tregear
comparative
pp
this
is
the
thesis
of
preuss
in
his
articles
in
the
which
we
have
cited
several
times
it
seems
that
also
tends
towards
this
conception
see
his
pp
on
this
point
see
our
pp
ff
it
may
be
objected
perhaps
that
unity
is
the
characteristic
of
the
personality
while
the
soul
has
always
been
conceived
as
multiple
and
as
capable
of
dividing
and
subdividing
itself
almost
to
infinity
but
we
know
that
the
unity
of
the
person
is
also
made
up
of
parts
and
that
it
too
is
capable
of
dividing
and
decomposing
yet
the
notion
of
personality
does
not
vanish
because
of
the
fact
that
we
no
longer
think
of
it
as
a
metaphysical
and
indivisible
atom
it
is
the
same
with
the
popular
conceptions
of
personality
which
find
their
expression
in
the
idea
of
the
soul
these
show
that
men
have
always
felt
that
the
human
personality
does
not
have
that
absolute
unity
attributed
to
it
by
certain
metaphysicians
for
all
this
we
do
not
deny
the
importance
of
the
individual
factor
this
is
explained
from
our
point
of
view
just
as
easily
as
its
contrary
if
the
essential
element
of
the
personality
is
the
social
part
of
us
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
no
social
life
unless
distinct
individuals
are
associated
and
this
is
richer
the
more
numerous
and
different
from
each
other
they
are
so
the
individual
factor
is
a
condition
of
the
impersonal
factor
and
the
contrary
is
no
less
true
for
society
itself
is
an
important
source
of
individual
differences

it
is
true
that
some

are
not
situated
around
the

they
are
scattered
over
different
parts
of

it
is

that
these
are
places
where
an
isolated
ancestor
disappeared

have
only
a

so
it
may
be
that
they
have
taken
this
character
only
by
analogy
with

principal
totemic
centres
the

and
rocks
which
for
some
reason

remind

this
close
connection
between
the
soul

guardian
genius

the
moral
conscience
of
the
individual
is
especially
apparent
among
certain
peoples
of
indonesia
one
of
the
seven
souls
of
the
tobabatak
is
buried
with

though
preferring
to
live
in
this
place
it
may
leave
it
to
warn
the
individual
or
to
manifest
its
approbation
when
he
does
well
so
in
one
sense
it
plays
the
rôle
of
a
moral
conscience
however
its
communications
are
not
confined
to
the
domain
of
moral
facts
it
is
called
the
younger
brother
of
the
soul
as
the
placenta
is
called

younger

of

it
still
remains
to
be
investigated
how
it
comes
that
after
a
certain
moment
in
evolution
this
duplication
of
the
soul
was
made
in
the
form
of
an
individual
totem
rather
than
of
a
protecting
ancestor
perhaps
this
question
has
an
ethnological
rather
than
a
sociological
interest
however
the
manner
in
which
this
substitution
was
probably
effected
may
be
represented
as
follows
the
individual
totem
commenced
by
playing
a
merely
complimentary
rôle
those
individuals
who
wished
to
acquire
powers
superior
to
those
possessed
by
everybody
did
not
and
could
not
content
themselves
with
the
mere
protection
of
the
ancestor
so
they
began
to
look
for
another
assistant
of
the
same
sort
thus
it
comes
about
that
among
the
euahlayi
the
magicians
are
the
only
ones
who
have
or
who
can
procure
individual
totems
as
each
one
has
a
collective
totem
in
addition
he
finds
himself
having
many
souls
but
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
this
plurality
of
souls
it
is
the
condition
of
a
superior
power
but
when
collective
totemism
once
begins
to
lose
ground
and
when
the
conception
of
the
protecting
ancestor
consequently
begins
to
grow
dim
in
the
mind
another
method
must
be
found
for
representing
the
double
nature
of
the
soul
which
is
still
felt
the
resulting
idea
was
that
outside
of
the
individual
soul
there
was
another
charged
with
watching
over
the
first
one
since
this
protecting
power
was
no
longer
demonstrated
by
the
very
fact
of
birth
men
found
it
natural
to
employ
for
its
discovery
means
analogous
to
those
used
by
magicians
to
enter
into
communion
with
the
forces
of
whose
aid
they
thus
assured
themselves

the

see

is

form

there
is
no

of
writers
who
putting
their
trust
in

have
believed
that
the
institution
thus
designated
was
peculiar
to

peoples

or
even
to
the
polynesians
see

richard

see
above
this
is
not
saying
that
there
is
a
radical
break
of
continuity
between
the
religious
and
the
magic
interdictions
on
the
contrary
it
is
one
whose
true
nature
is
not
decided
there
are
interdicts
of
of
which
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
they
are
religious
or
magic
but
their
distinction
is
necessary
for
we
believe
that
the
magic
interdicts
can
not
be
understood
except
as
a
function
of
the
religious
ones
see
above
many
of
the
interdictions
between
sacred
things
can
be
traced
back
we
think
to
those
between
the
sacred
and
the
profane
this
is
the
case
with
the
interdicts
of
age
or
rank
for
example
in
australia
there
are
sacred
foods
which
are
reserved
for
the
initiated
but
these
foods
are
not
all
sacred
to
the
same
degree
there
is
a
hierarchy
among
them
nor
are
the
initiated
all
equal
they
do
not
enjoy
all
their
religious
rights
from
the
first
but
only
enter
step
by
step
into
the
domain
of
religious
things
they
must
pass
through
a
whole
series
of
ranks
which
are
conferred
upon
them
one
after
another
after
special
trials
and
ceremonies
it
requires
months
and
sometimes
even
years
to
reach
the
highest
rank
now
special
foods
are
assigned
to
each
of
these
ranks
the
men
of
the
lower
ranks
may
not
touch
the
foods
which
rightfully
belong
to
the
men
of
the
superior
ones
see
mathews
pp
ff
parker
spencer
and
gillen
pp
ff
pp
so
the
more
sacred
repels
the
less
sacred
but
this
is
because
the
second
is
profane
in
relation
to
the
first
in
fine
all
the
interdictions
arrange
themselves
in
two
classes
the
interdictions
between
the
sacred
and
the
profane
and
the
purely
sacred
and
the
impurely
sacred
see
above
spencer
and
gillen
pp
howitt
spencer
and
gillen
schulze
spencer
and
gillen
howitt
if
the
alimentary
interdictions
which
concern
the
totemic
plant
or
vegetable
are
the
most
important
they
are
far
from
being
the
only
ones
we
have
seen
that
there
are
foods
which
are
forbidden
to
the
because
they
are
sacred
now
very
different
causes
may
confer
this
character
for
example
as
we
shall
presently
see
the
birds
which
are
seen
on
the
tops
of
trees
are
reputed
to
be
sacred
because
they
are
neighbours
to
the
great
god
who
lives
in
heaven
thus
it
is
possible
that
for
different
reasons
the
flesh
of
certain
animals
has
been
specially
reserved
for
the
old
men
and
that
consequently
it
has
seemed
to
partake
of
the
sacred
character
recognized
in
these
latter
see
frazer
howitt
p
there
is
one
interdiction
of
contact
of
which
we
say
nothing
because
it
is
very
hard
to
determine
its
exact
nature
this
is
sexual
contact
there
are
religious
periods
when
a
man
can
not
have
commerce
with
a
woman
pp
is
this
because
the
woman
is
profane
or
because
the
sexual
act
is
dreaded
this
question
can
not
be
decided
in
passing
we
set
it
aside
along
with
all
that
concerns
conjugal
and
sexual
rites
it
is
too
closely
connected
with
the
problems
of
marriage
and
the
family
to
be
separated
from
them

this
act
takes
on
a
sacred
character
it
is
true
when
the
elements
eaten
are
sacred
but
in
itself
the
act
is
so
very
profane
that
eating
a
sacred
food
always
constitutes
a
profanation
the
profanation
may
be
permitted
or
even
ordered
but
as
we
shall
see
below
only
on
condition
that
rites
attenuating
or
expiating
it
precede
or
accompany
it
the
existence
of
these
rites
shows
that
by
itself
the
sacred
thing
should
not
be
eaten
spencer
and
gillen
howitt
perhaps
the
rule
against
talking
during
the
great
religious
solemnities
is
due
to
the
same
cause
men
speak
and
especially
in
a
high
voice
during
ordinary
life
then
in
the
religious
life
they
ought
to
keep
still
or
talk
in
a
low
voice
this
same
consideration
is
not
foreign
to
the
alimentary
interdictions
see
above
since
there
is
a
sacred
principle
the
soul
within
each
man
from
the
very
first
the
individual
is
surrounded
by
interdicts
the
original
form
of
the
moral
interdicts
which
isolate
and
protect
the
human
person
thus
the
corpse
of
his
victim
is
considered
dangerous
for
a
murderer
spencer
and
gillen
and
is
taboo
for
him
now
the
interdicts
having
this
origin
are
frequently
used
by
individuals
as
a
means
of
withdrawing
certain
things
from
common
use
and
thus
establishing
a
property
right
over
them
when
a
man
goes
away
from
the
camp
leaving
his
arms
and
food
there
says
roth
speaking
of
the
tribes
on
the
palmer
river
north
queensland
if
he
urinates
near
the
objects
he
leaves
they
become
equivalent
to
taboo
and
he
may
be
sure
of
finding
them
intact
on
his
return
queensland
in
of
the
australian
vol
vii
no
this
is
because
the
urine
like
the
blood
is
believed
to
contain
some
of
the
sacred
force
which
is
personal
to
the
individual
so
it
keeps
strangers
at
a
distance
for
the
same
reasons
the
spoken
word
may
also
serve
as
a
vehicle
for
these
same
influences
that
is
how
it
becomes
possible
to
prevent
access
to
an
object
by
a
mere
verbal
declaration
this
power
of
making
interdicts
varies
with
different
individuals
it
is
greater
as
their
character
is
more
sacred
men
have
this
privilege
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
women
roth
cites
one
single
case
of
a
taboo
imposed
by
women
it
is
at
its
maximum
with
the
chiefs
and
old
men
who
use
it
to
monopolize
whatever
things
they
find
it
convenient
to
roth
thus
the
religious
interdict
becomes
a
right
of
property
and
an
administrative
rule

taboos

is
because

also
implies
a
grave
change
of
condition
we
limit
ourselves
to
mentioning
these
facts
summarily
without
stopping
over
them
for
the
first
concern
magic
which
is
not
our
subject
and
the
second
have
to
do
with
that
system
of
rules
which
relates
to
the
commerce
of
the
sexes
the
study
of
which
will
be
possible
only
in
conjunction
with
the
other
precepts
of
primitive
conjugal
morality
it
is
true
that
preuss
interprets
these
facts
by
saying
that
suffering
is
a
way
of
increasing
a
man
magic
force
menschliche
from
this
expression
one
might
believe
that
suffering
is
a
magic
rite
not
a
religious
one
but
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
preuss
gives
the
name
magic
without
great
precision
to
all
anonymous
and
impersonal
forces
whether
they
belong
to
magic
or
religion
of
course
there
are
tortures
which
are
used
to
make
magicians
but
many
of
those
which
we
have
described
are
a
part
of
the
real
religious
ceremonies
and
consequently
it
is
the
religious
state
of
the
individuals
which
they
modify
preuss
ursprung
der
religion
und
in
lxxxviii
pp
under
this
same
rubric
preuss
classes
a
great
number
of
incongruous
rites
for
example
effusions
of
blood
which
act
in
virtue
of
the
positive
qualities
attributed
to
blood
and
not
because
of
the
suffering
which
they
imply
we
retain
only
those
in
which
suffering
is
an
essential
element
of
the
rite
and
the
cause
of
its
efficacy
pp
a
similar
practice
will
be
found
among
the
dieri
howitt
pp
spencer
and
gillen
pp
from
this
example
we
see
that
the
rites
of
initiation
sometimes
have
all
the
characteristics
of
hazing
in
fact
hazing
is
a
real
social
institution
which
arises
spontaneously
every
time
that
two
groups
inequal
in
their
moral
and
social
situation
come
into
intimate
contact
in
this
case
the
one
considering
itself
superior
to
the
other
resists
the
intrusion
of
the
it
reacts
against
them
is
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
aware
of
the
superiority
it
feels
this
reaction
which
is
produced
automatically
and
which
takes
the
form
of
more
or
less
grave
cruelties
quite
naturally
is
also
destined
to
shape
the
individuals
for
their
new
existence
and
assimilate
them
into
their
new
environment
so
it
is
a
sort
of
initiation
thus
it
is
explained
how
the
initiation
on
its
side
takes
the
form
of
hazing
it
is
because
the
group
of
old
men
is
superior
in
religious
and
moral
dignity
to
that
of
the
young
men
and
yet
the
first
must
assimilate
the
second

hazing

we

contagious
character
of
sacredness

affirmed

not
on
a
faith

interpreted
experiences

it
is
true
that
this
contagiousness
is
not
peculiar
to
religious
forces
those
belonging
to
magic
have
the
same
property
yet
it
is
evident
that
they
do
not
correspond
to
objectified
social
sentiments
it
is
because
magic
forces
have
been
conceived
on
the
model
of
religious
forces

contests
the
exactness
of
this
expression

to
him

rite
makes
real
kangaroos

bodies
appear

this

we
see
this
is
all
that
spencer
and
gillen
mean
to
say
it
is
quite
certain
moreover
that
they
are
not
pure
spirits

as
a
christian
might
conceive

p
the
analysis
of
the
rites
which
have
just
been
studied
is
based
solely
on
the
observations
of
spencer
and
gillen
since
this
chapter
was
written
strehlow
has
published
the
third
fascicule
of
his
work
which
deals
with
the
positive
cult
and
especially
the
intichiuma
or
as
he
says
the
rites
of
the
but
we
have
found
nothing
in
this
publication
which
obliges
us
to
modify
the
preceding
description
or
even
to
complete
it
with
important
additions
the
most
interesting
thing
taught
by
strehlow
on
this
subject
is
that
the
effusions
and
oblations
of
blood
are
much
more
frequent
than
one
would
suspect
from
the
account
of
spencer
and
gillen
see
strehlow
iii
pp
moreover
the
information
given
by
strehlow
in
regard
to
the
cult
must
be
taken
carefully
for
he
was
not
a
witness
of
the
rites
he
describes
he
confined
himself
to
collecting
oral
testimony
which
is
generally
rather
summary
see
fasc
iii
preface
of
leonhardi
v
it
may
even
be
asked
if
he
has
not
confused
the
totemic
ceremonies
of
initiation
with
those
which
he
calls
to
an
excessive
degree
of
course
he
has
made
a
praiseworthy
attempt
to
distinguish
them
and
has
made
two
of
their
distinctive
characteristics
very
evident
in
the
first
place
the
intichiuma
always
takes
place
at
a
sacred
spot
to
which
the
souvenir
of
some
ancestor
is
attached
while
the
initiation
ceremonies
may
be
celebrated
anywhere
secondly
the
oblations
of
blood
are
special
to
the
intichiuma
which
proves
that
they
are
close
to
the
heart
of
the
ritual
iii
but
in
the
description
which
he
gives
us
of
the
rites
we
find
facts
belonging
indifferently
to
each
species
of
ceremony
in
fact
in
what
he
describes
under
the
name
mbatjalkatiuma
the
young
men
generally
take
an
important
part
for
example
see
pp
etc
which
is
characteristic
of
the
initiation
also
it
seems
as
though
the
place
of
the
rite
is
arbitrary
for
the
actors
construct
their
scene
artificially
they
dig
a
hole
into
which
they
go
he
seldom
makes
any
allusion
to
sacred
trees
or
rocks
and
their
ritual
rôle
cf
meyer
encounter
bay
in
woods

and
gillen
pp
pp

have
already
cited

case
others

gillen

for
the
second
part
of
the
ceremony
as
for
the
first
we
have
followed
spencer
and
gillen
on
this
subject
the
recent
fascicule
of
strehlow
only
confirms
the
observations
of
his
predecessors
at
least
on
all
essential
points
he
recognizes
that
after
the
first
ceremony
two
months
afterwards
he
says
the
chief
of
the
clan
eats
the
totemic
animal
or
plant
ritually
and
that
after
this
he
raises
the
interdicts
he
calls
this
operation
freigabe
des
totems
zum
allgemeinen
iii
he
even
tells
us
that
this
operation
is
important
enough
to
have
a
special
word
for
it
in
the
arunta
language
he
adds
it
is
true
that
this
ritual
consummation
is
not
the
only
one
but
that
the
chiefs
and
old
men
sometimes
eat
the
sacred
plant
or
animal
before
the
first
ceremony
and
that
the
performer
of
the
rite
does
so
after
the
celebration
the
fact
is
not
improbable
these
consummations
are
means
employed
by
the
officiants
or
assistants
to
acquire
virtues
which
they
acquire
it
is
not
surprising
if
they
are
numerous
it
does
not
invalidate
the
account
of
spencer
and
gillen
at
all
for
the
rite
upon
which
they
insist
and
not
without
reason
is
the
des
on
only
two
points
does
strehlow
contest
the
allegations
of
spencer
and
gillen
in
the
first
place
he
declares
that
the
ritual
consumption
does
not
take
place
in
every
case
this
can
not
be
doubted
for
there
are
some
animals
and
plants
which
are
not
edible
but
still
the
rite
is
very
frequent
strehlow
himself
cites
numerous
examples
pp
secondly
we
have
seen
that
according
to
spencer
and
gillen
if
the
chief
does
not
eat
the
totemic
animal
or
plant
he
will
lose
his
powers
strehlow
assures
us
that
the
testimony
of
natives
does
not
confirm
this
assertion
but
this
question
seems
to
us
to
be
quite
secondary
the
assured
fact
is
that
the
ritual
consumption
is
required
so
it
must
be
thought
useful
or
necessary
now
like
every
communion
it
can
only
serve
to
confer
needed
virtues
upon
the
person
communicating
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
that
the
natives
or
some
of
them
have
forgotten
this
function
of
the
rite
that
it
is
not
real
is
it
necessary
to
repeat
that
worshippers
are
generally
ignorant
of
the
real
reasons
for
their
practices

verse
at
least
when
it
is
complete
in
certain
cases
it
may
be
reduced
to
one
of
its
elements
strehlow
says
that
the
natives
regard
these
ceremonies
as
a
sort
of
divine
service
just
as
a
christian
regards
the
exercises
of
his
religion
iii
it
should
be
asked
for
example
whether
the
effusions
of
blood
and
the
offerings
of
hair
which
smith
regards
as
acts
of
communion
are
not
real
oblations
see
smith
pp
the
expiatory
rites
of
which
we
shall
speak
more
fully
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
this
same
book
are
almost
exclusively
oblations
they
are
communions
only
secondarily
this
is
why
we
frequently
speak
of
the
ceremonies
as
if
they
were
addressed
to
living
personalities
see
for
example
texts
by
krichauff
and
kemp
in
eylmann
in
a
philosophical
sense
the
same
is
true
of
everything
for
nothing
exists
except
in
representation
but
as
we
have
shown
this
proposition
is
doubly
true
for
religious
forces
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
things
which
corresponds
to
sacredness
see
mauss
sur
les
variations

in

pp
ff
it
is
true
that
spencer
and
gillen
do
not
say
expressly
that
this
is
an
intichiuma
but
the
context
allow
of
no
doubt

this
point

of
course

may
ask
if
this
effusion
of
blood
is
not
an
oblation
designed
to
win
the
powers
which
produce
rain

we
say
nothing
of
what
has
been
called
the
law
of
opposition
for
as
mm
hubert

mauss
have
shown
a
contrary

its
opposite

through
the
intermediacy
of
a
similar
générale

on
the
history
of

is
applicable
in
the
sense
that
there
is
really
an
association
of
the
statue
and
the
person
encharmed
but
it
is
true
that
this
association
is
the
simple
product
of
an
association
of
ideas
by
similarity
the
true
determining
cause
of
the
phenomenon
is
the
contagiousness
peculiar
to
religious
forces
as
we
have
shown
for
the
causes
determining
this

we
do
not
wish
to
say
that
there
was
ever
a
time
when
religion
existed
without
magic
probably
as
religion
took
form
certain
of
its
principles
were
extended
to
relations
and
it
was
thus
supplemented
by
a
more
or
less
developed
magic
but
if
these
two
systems
of
ideas
and
practices
do
not
correspond
to
distinct
historical
phases
they
have
a
relation
of
definite
derivation
between
them
this
is
all
we
have
sought
to
establish
pp
ff
see
above
pp
of
course
animal
societies
do
exist
however
the
word
does
not
have
exactly
the
same
sense
when
applied
to
men
and
to
animals
the
institution
is
a
characteristic
fact
of
human
societies
but
animals
have
no
institutions
the
conception
of
cause
is
not
the
same
for
a
scholar
and
for
a
man
with
no
scientific
culture
also
many
of
our
contemporaries
understand
the
principle
of
causality
differently
as
they
apply
it
to
social
facts
and
to
facts
in
the
social
order
men
frequently
exhibit
a
conception
of
causality
singularly
like
that
which
was
at
the
basis
of
magic
for
a
long
time
one
might
even
ask
if
a
physicist
and
a
biologist
represent
the
causal
relation
in
the
same
fashion
of
course
these
ceremonies
are
not
followed
by
an
alimentary
communion
according
to
strehlow
they
have
another
name
at
least
when
they
concern
plants
they
are
called
not
mbatjalkatiuma

strehlow

iii
the
warramunga
are
not
the
only
ones
among
whom
the
intichiuma
takes
the
form
of
a
dramatic
representation
it
is
also
found
among
the
tjingilli
the
umbaia
the
wulmala
the
walpari
and
even
the
kaitish
though
in
certain
of
its
features
the
ritual
of
these
latter
resembles
that
of
the
arunta
if
we
take
the
warramunga
as
a
type
it
is
because
they
have
been
studied
the
best
by
spencer
and
gillen
this
is
the
case
with
the
intichiuma
of
the
black
cockatoo
see
above
pp
ff
one
of
these
two
actors
does
not
belong
to
the
black
snake
clan
but
to
that
of
the
crow
this
is
because
the
crow
is
supposed
to
be
an
associate
of
the
black
snake
in
other
words
it
is
a
see
spencer
and
gillen
strehlow
iii
strehlow
himself
recognizes
this
the
totemic
ancestor
and
his
descendant
who
represents
him
are
presented
as
one
in
these
sacred
hymns
iii
as
this
incontestable
fact
contradicts
the
theory
according
to
which
ancestral
souls
do
not
reincarnate
themselves
strehlow
adds
it
is
true
in
a
note
that
in
the
course
of
the
ceremony
there
is
no
real
incarnation
of
the
ancestor
in
the
person
who
represents
him
if
strehlow
wishes
to
say
that
the
incarnation
does
not
take
place
on
the
occasion
of
the
ceremony
then
nothing
is
more
certain
but
if
he
means
that
there
is
no
incarnation
at
all
we
do
not
understand
how
the
officiant
and
the
ancestor
can
be
confounded
perhaps
this
difference
is
partially
due
to
the
fact
that
among
the
warramunga
each
clan
is
thought
to
be
descended
from
one
single
ancestor
about
whom
the
legendary
history
of
the
clan
centres
this
is
the
ancestor
whom
the
rite
commemorates
now
the
officiant
need
not
be
descended
from
him
one
might
even
ask
if
these
mythical
chiefs
who
are
sorts
of
demigods
are
submitted
to
reincarnation
in
this
intichiuma
three
assistants
represent
ancestors
of
a
considerable
antiquity
they
play
a
real
part
pp
it
is
true
that
spencer
and
gillen
add
that
these
are
ancestors
posterior
to
the
alcheringa
nevertheless
mythical
personages
are
represented
in
the
course
of
the
rite
sacred
rocks
and
are
not
mentioned
the
centre
of
the
ceremony
is
the
image
of
an
emu
drawn
on
the
ground
which
can
be
made
anywhere
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
the
ceremonies
of
the
warramunga
are
of
this
type
the
example
of
the
white
cockatoo
of
which
we
spoke
above
proves
that
there
are
exceptions
pp
ff
on
this
same
subject
cf
certain
passages
of
eylmann
which
evidently
refer
to
the
same
mythical
being
strehlow
also
mentions
a
mythical
snake
among
the
arunta
which
may
not
differ
greatly
from
the
wollunqua
strehlow
i
cf
ii
where
the
kulaia
is
found
in
a
list
of
totems
we
use
the
arunta
words
in
order
not
to
complicate
our
terminology
the
warramunga
call
this
mythical
period
wingara
it
is
not
easy
to
express
in
words
what
is
in
reality
rather
a
vague
feeling
amongst
the
natives
but
after
carefully
watching
the
different
series
of
ceremonies
we
were
impressed
with
the
feeling
that
the
wollunqua
represented
to
the
native
mind
the
idea
of
a
dominant
totem
one
of
the
most
solemn
of
these
ceremonies
is
the
one
which
we
have
had
occasion
to
describe
above
in
the
course
of
which
an
image
of
the
wollunqua
is
designed
on
a
sort
of
hillock
which
is
then
torn
to
pieces
in
the
midst
of
a
general
effervescence
pp
here
are
the
terms
of
spencer
and
gillen
in
the
only
passage
in
which
they
speak
of
a
possible
connection
between
the
wollunqua
and
rain
a
few
days
after
the
rite
about
the
hillock
the
old
men
say
that
they
have
heard
wollunqua
speak
that
he
was
satisfied
with
what
had
passed
and
that
he
was
going
to
send
rain
the
reason
for
this
prophecy
was
that
they
as
well
as
ourselves
had
heard
thunder
rolling
at
a
distance
to
such
a
slight
extent
is
the
production
of
rain
the
immediate
object
of
the
ceremony
that
they
did
not
attribute
it
to
wollunqua
until
several
days
later
and
then
after
accidental
circumstances
another
fact
shows
how
vague
the
ideas
of
the
natives
are
on
this
point
a
few
lines
below
thunder
is
spoken
of
as
a
sign
not
of
the
wollunqua
satisfaction
but
of
its
discontent
in
spite
of
these
prognostics
continue
our
authors
the
rain
did
not
fall
but
some
days
later
they
heard
the
thunder
rolling
in
the
distance
again
the
old
men
said
that
the
wollunqua
was
grumbling
because
he
was
not
contented
with
the
way
in
which
the
rite
had
been
celebrated
thus
a
single
phenomenon
the
noise
of
thunder
is
sometimes
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
a
favouring
disposition
and
sometimes
as
a
mark
of
evil
intentions
however
there
is
one
detail
of
the
ritual
which
if
we
accept
the
explanation
of
it
proposed
by
spencer
and
gillen
is
directly
efficient
according
to
them
the
destruction
of
the
hillock
was
intended
to
frighten
the
wollunqua
and
to
prevent
it
by
magic
constraint
from
leaving
its
retreat
but
this
interpretation
seems
very
doubtful
to
us
in
fact
in
the
very
case
of
which
we
were
speaking
where
it
was
announced
that
the
wollunqua
was
dissatisfied
this
dissatisfaction
was
attributed
to
the
fact
that
they
had
neglected
to
take
away
the
debris
of
the
hillock
so
this
removal
is
demanded
by
the
wollunqua
itself
and
in
no
way
intended
to
intimidate
it
and
exercise
a
coercive
influence
over
it
this
is
probably
merely
one
case
of
a
more
general
rule
which
is
in
force
among
the
warramunga
the
instruments
of
the
cult
must
be
destroyed
after
each
ceremony
thus
the
ritual
ornamentations
with
which
the
officiants
are
decorated
are
violently
torn
off
from
them
when
the
rite
is
terminated

list
of
totems

up

among

arunta
there
is
also
a
totem
which
greatly
resembles
the
laughing
boy
totem
of
warramunga
and
iii
means
young
men
the
object
of
the
ceremony
is
to
make
the
young
men
take
more
pleasure
in
the
game

this
game

thus
the
exogamic
rules
must
be
violated
in
the
course
of
certain
religious
ceremonies
see
above
a
precise
ritual
meaning
probably
could
not
be
found
for
these
excesses
it
is
merely
a
mechanical
consequence
of
the
state
of
provoked
by
the
ceremony
it
is
an
example
of
rites
having
no
definite
object
themselves
but
which
are
mere
discharges
of
energy
see
above
the
native
does
not
assign
them
a
definite
end
either
he
merely
says
that
if
these
licences
are
not
committed
the
rite
will
not
produce
its
effects
the
ceremony
will
fail
here
are
the
very
words
used
by
spencer
and
gillen
they
the
ceremonies
connected
with
the
totems
are
often
though
by
no
means
always
associated
with
the
performance
of
the
ceremonies
attendant
upon
initiation
of
young
men
or
are
connected
with
the
intichiuma
we
leave
aside
the
question
of
what
this
character
consists
in
it
is
a
problem
which
would
lead
us
into
a
very
long
and
technical
development
and
which
must
therefore
be
treated
by
itself
moreover
it
does
not
concern
the
propositions
established
in
this
present
work
this
is
chapter
vi
entitled
connected
with
the
strehlow
iii
pp
this
explains
the
error
of
which
strehlow
accuses
spencer
and
gillen
that
they
applied
to
one
form
of
the
ceremony
the
term
which
is
more
appropriate
for
the
other
but
in
these
conditions
the
error
hardly
seems
to
have
the
gravity
attributed
to
it
by
strehlow
it
can
not
be
otherwise
in
fact
as
the
initiation
is
a
tribal
feast
novices
of
different
totems
are
initiated
at
the
same
time
so
the
ceremonies
which
thus
succeed
one
another
in
the
same
place
have
to
do
with
several
totems
and
therefore
they
must
take
place
away
from
the
places
with
which
they
are
connected
by
the
myth
it
will
now
be
understood
why
we
have
never
studied
the
initiation
rites
by
themselves
it
is
because
they
are
not
a
ritual
entity
but
are
formed
by
the
conglomeration
of
rites
of
different
sorts
there
are
interdictions
ascetic
rites
and
representative
ceremonies
which
can
not
be
distinguished
from
those
celebrated
at
the
time
of
the
intichiuma
so
we
had
to
dismember
this
composite
system
and
treat
each
of
the
different
rites
composing
it
separately
classifying
them
with
the
similar
rites
to
which
they
are
to
be
related
we
have
also
seen
pp
ff
that
the
initiation
has
served
as
the
point
of
departure
for
a
new
religion
which
tends
to
surpass
totemism
but
it
has
been
sufficient
for
us
to
show
that
totemism
contained
the
germs
of
this
religion
we
have
had
no
need
of
following
out
its
development
the
object
of
this
book
is
to
study
the
elementary
beliefs
and
practices
so
we
must
stop
at
the
moment
when
they
give
birth
to
more
complex
forms
if
the
individual
may
choose
between
the
ceremonies
of
his
paternal
and
maternal
totems
it
is
because
owing
to
reasons
which
we

the

whether
these

the

is
the
more
probable
one
pp
this
interdiction
against

which
is
peculiar
to

in

we

it
may
be
asked
why
repeated
ceremonies
are
necessary
to
produce
the
relief
which
follows
upon
mourning
the
funeral
ceremonies
are
frequently
very
long
they
include
many
operations
which
take
place
at
intervals
during
many
months
thus
they
prolong
and
support
the
moral
disturbance
brought
about
by
the
death
cf
hertz
representation

de
la

in
a
general
way
a
death
marks
a
grave
change
of
condition
which
has
extended

it
takes
a
long
time
to
neutralize
these
effects
in
a
case
reported
by
grey
from
the
observations
of

the
rite
has
all
the
aspects
of
a
sacrifice
the
blood
is
sprinkled
over
the
body
itself

in

cases
there
is
something
like
an
offering
of
the
beard
men
in
mourning
cut
off
a
part
of
their
beards
which
they
throw
on
to
the
corpse
pp
of
course
each
churinga
is
believed
to
be
connected
with
an
ancestor
but
it
is
not
to
appease
the
spirits
of
the
ancestors
that
they
mourn
for
the
lost
churinga
we
have
shown
elsewhere
that
the
idea
of
the
ancestor
only
entered
into
the
conception
of
the
churinga
secondarily

is
used

expiate

also
possible
that
the
belief
in
the
morally
tempering
virtues

see

has
added
something
here

sorrow
sanctifies

raises

up

might
be

efface

was
only
when

no

understood
the
meaning
of
the

that
the
sacrosanct
animal
was
considered
impure
pp
but
it
is
inadmissible
that
beliefs
and
practices
as
universal
as
these
which
we
find
at
the
foundation
of
the
expiatory
sacrifice
should
be
the
product
of
a
mere
error
of
interpretation
in
fact
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
expiatory
victim
was
charged
with
the
impurity
of
the
sin
we
have
shown
moreover
that
these
transformations
of
the
pure
into
the
impure
or
the
contrary
are
to
be
found
in
the
most
inferior
societies
which
we
know

religious
quoted
by

see
above
pp
ff
only
one
form
of
social
activity
has
not
yet
been
expressly
attached
to
religion
that
is
economic
activity
sometimes
processes
that
are
derived
from
magic
have
by
that
fact
alone
an
origin
that
is
indirectly
religious
also
economic
value
is
a
sort
of
power

efficacy

we

has

hence
it
is
seen
that
the
ideas
of
economic
value
and
of
religious
value
are
not
without
connection
but
the
question
of
the
nature
of
these
connections
has
not
yet
been
studied
it
is
for
this
reason
that
frazer
and

this
universality
of
the
concept
should
not
be
confused
with
its
generality
they
are
very
different
things
what
we
mean
by
universality
is
the
property
which
the
concept
has
of
being
communicable
to
a
number
of
minds
and
in
principle
to
all
minds
but
this
communicability
is
wholly
independent
of
the
degree
of
its
extension
a
concept
which
is
applied
to
only
one
object
and
whose
extension
is
consequently
at
the
minimum
can
be
the
same
for
everybody
such
is
the
case
with
the
concept
of
a
deity
it
may
be
objected
that
frequently
as
the
mere
effect
of
repetition
ways
of
thinking
and
acting
become
fixed
and
crystallized
in
the
individual
in
the
form
of
habits
which
resist
change
but
a
habit
is
only
a
tendency
to
repeat
an
act
or
idea
automatically
every
time
that
the
same
circumstances
appear
it
does
not
at
all
imply
that
the
idea
or
act
is
in
the
form
of
an
exemplary
type
proposed
to
or
imposed
upon
the
mind
or
will
it
is
only
when
a
type
of
this
sort
is
set
up
that
is
to
say
when
a
rule
or
standard
is
established
that
social
action
can
and
should
be
presumed
thus
we
see
how
far
it
is
from
being
true
that
a
conception
lacks
objective
value
merely
because
it
has
a
social
origin
