i
the
strange
voice
it
was
jimmy
skunk
speaking
he
had
just
met
peter
rabbit
halfway
down
the
crooked
little
path
just
where
the
moonlight
was
brightest
but
he
did
not
need
to
tell
peter
to
listen
peter
listening
with
all
his
might
he
was
sitting
up
very
straight
and
his
long
ears
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
strange
sound
just
then
it
came
again
a
sound
such
as
neither
peter
rabbit
nor
jimmy
skunk
had
ever
heard
before
peter
teeth
began
to
chatter
wha
wha
what
is
it
he
whispered
i
do
know
unless
it
is
hooty
the
owl
gone
crazy
replied
jimmy
no
said
peter
it
is
hooty
the
owl
hooty
never
could
make
such
a
noise
as
maybe
it
dippy
the
loon
i
heard
him
on
the
big
river
and
he
sounds
just
as
if
he
had
gone
crazy
replied
jimmy
no
said
peter
looking
behind
him
nervously
no
it
is
dippy
the
loon
for
dippy
never
leaves
the
water
and
that
voice
came
from
the
green
meadows
i
would
be
surprised
peter
did
finish
for
just
then
the
strange
voice
sounded
again
and
it
was
nearer
than
before
never
had
the
green
meadows
or
the
green
forest
heard
anything
like
it
it
sounded
something
like
hooty
the
owl
and
dippy
the
loon
and
two
or
three
little
dogs
howling
all
together
and
there
was
something
in
the
sound
that
made
cold
chills
run
up
and
down
peter
rabbit
backbone
he
crept
a
little
closer
to
jimmy
skunk
i
believe
it
is
farmer
brown
boy
and
some
of
his
friends
laughing
and
shouting
together
said
jimmy
no
it
is
farmer
brown
boy
and
his
friends
can
make
some
dreadful
noises
but
nothing
so
dreadful
as
that
it
makes
me
afraid
jimmy
skunk
said
peter
pooh
you
afraid
of
your
own
shadow
replied
jimmy
skunk
who
afraid
of
much
of
anything
let
go
down
there
and
find
out
what
it
peter
big
eyes
grew
rounder
than
ever
with
fright
at
the
very
thought
you
think
of
such
a
thing
jimmy
skunk
i
think
of
such
a
thing
he
chattered
i
know
it
something
terrible
oh
dear
i
wish
i
were
safe
at
home
in
the
dear
old
again
sounded
the
strange
voice
or
was
it
voices
it
seemed
sometimes
as
if
there
were
two
or
three
together
then
again
it
sounded
like
only
one
each
time
peter
rabbit
crept
a
little
closer
to
jimmy
skunk
pretty
soon
even
jimmy
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
i
going
home
said
he
suddenly
i
want
to
but
i
do
dare
to
said
peter
shaking
all
over
with
fright
pooh
any
one
who
can
run
as
fast
as
you
can
ought
not
to
be
afraid
said
jimmy
but
if
you
really
are
afraid
you
can
come
up
to
my
oh
thank
you
jimmy
skunk
i
believe
i
will
come
sit
on
your
doorstep
if
you
do
illustration
so
together
they
went
up
to
jimmy
skunk
house
and
sat
on
his
doorstep
in
the
moonlight
and
listened
to
the
strange
voice
all
the
long
night
and
then
when
he
saw
old
mother
west
wind
coming
down
from
the
purple
hills
in
the
early
dawn
peter
rabbit
became
courageous
enough
to
start
for
his
home
in
the
dear
old
ii
peter
rabbit
run
for
life
was
very
very
early
in
the
morning
when
old
mother
west
wind
came
down
from
the
purple
hills
with
her
big
bag
and
out
of
it
emptied
her
children
the
merry
little
breezes
to
play
on
the
green
meadows
peter
rabbit
watching
her
from
the
doorstep
of
jimmy
skunk
house
felt
his
courage
grow
all
the
night
long
he
and
jimmy
skunk
had
sat
on
the
doorstep
listening
to
a
strange
voice
a
terrible
voice
peter
had
thought
but
with
the
first
light
of
the
coming
day
the
voice
had
been
heard
no
more
and
now
as
peter
watched
old
mother
west
wind
just
as
he
had
done
so
often
before
he
began
to
wonder
if
that
dreadful
voice
had
been
a
bad
dream
so
he
bade
jimmy
skunk
and
started
for
his
home
in
the
dear
old
he
wanted
to
run
just
as
fast
as
he
knew
how
but
he
did
no
sir
he
did
that
is
not
while
he
was
in
sight
of
jimmy
skunk
you
see
he
knew
that
jimmy
would
laugh
at
him
he
was
brave
enough
to
be
laughed
at
the
bravest
boy
is
not
the
one
who
does
some
mighty
deed
who
risks
his
very
life
perchance
to
serve
another
need
the
bravest
boy
is
he
who
dares
to
face
the
scornful
laugh
for
doing
what
he
knows
is
right
though
others
mock
and
chaff
but
as
soon
as
peter
was
sure
that
jimmy
skunk
could
no
longer
see
him
he
began
to
hurry
and
the
nearer
he
got
to
the
old
the
faster
he
hurried
he
would
run
a
little
way
as
fast
as
he
could
and
then
stop
and
look
and
listen
nervously
then
he
would
do
it
all
over
again
it
was
one
of
these
times
when
he
was
listening
that
peter
thought
he
heard
a
soft
footstep
behind
him
it
sounded
very
much
like
the
footstep
of
reddy
fox
peter
crouched
down
very
low
and
sat
perfectly
still
holding
his
breath
and
straining
his
ears
there
it
was
again
very
soft
and
coming
nearer
peter
waited
no
longer
he
sprang
forward
with
a
great
leap
and
started
for
the
dear
old
as
fast
as
he
could
go
which
you
know
is
very
fast
indeed
as
he
ran
he
saw
behind
him
a
fierce
grinning
face
it
was
very
much
like
the
face
of
reddy
fox
only
larger
and
fiercer
and
gray
instead
of
red
never
in
all
his
life
had
peter
run
as
he
did
now
for
he
knew
that
he
was
running
for
his
life
it
seemed
as
if
those
long
legs
of
his
hardly
touched
the
ground
he
did
dare
try
any
of
the
tricks
with
which
he
had
so
often
fooled
reddy
fox
for
he
did
know
anything
about
this
terrible
stranger
he
might
not
be
fooled
by
tricks
as
reddy
fox
was
peter
began
to
breathe
hard
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
feel
the
hot
breath
of
the
fierce
stranger
and
right
down
inside
peter
somehow
felt
sure
that
this
was
the
owner
of
the
strange
voice
which
had
so
frightened
him
in
the
night
snap
that
was
a
pair
of
cruel
jaws
right
at
his
very
heels
it
gave
peter
new
strength
and
he
made
longer
jumps
than
before
the
dear
old
the
safe
old
was
just
ahead
with
three
mighty
jumps
peter
reached
the
opening
of
one
of
his
own
private
little
paths
and
dived
in
under
a
bramble
bush
and
even
as
he
did
so
he
heard
the
clash
of
sharp
teeth
and
felt
some
hair
pulled
from
his
tail
and
then
outside
the
old
broke
forth
that
same
terrible
voice
peter
had
heard
in
the
night
peter
did
stop
to
look
at
the
stranger
but
hurried
to
the
very
middle
of
the
old
and
there
he
stretched
out
at
full
length
and
panted
and
panted
for
breath
iii
reddy
fox
makes
a
discovery
fox
had
boasted
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
unknown
stranger
who
had
frightened
peter
rabbit
so
and
whose
voice
in
the
night
had
brought
the
great
fear
to
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
but
reddy
fox
is
always
boasting
and
a
boaster
is
seldom
very
brave
right
down
deep
in
his
heart
reddy
afraid
what
he
was
afraid
of
he
did
know
that
is
one
reason
that
he
was
afraid
he
is
always
afraid
of
things
that
he
does
know
about
old
granny
fox
had
taught
reddy
that
if
you
are
afraid
of
things
you
do
know
all
about
and
just
keep
away
from
them
they
never
will
hurt
you
said
wise
old
granny
fox
and
that
is
one
reason
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
never
been
able
to
catch
her
in
a
trap
but
granny
was
too
smart
to
boast
that
she
was
afraid
when
she
was
while
reddy
was
forever
bragging
of
how
brave
he
was
when
all
the
time
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
cowards
among
all
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
when
he
had
first
heard
that
strange
voice
little
cold
chills
had
chased
each
other
up
and
down
his
backbone
just
as
they
had
with
nearly
all
the
others
who
had
heard
it
and
reddy
had
not
gone
hunting
that
night
but
reddy
has
a
big
appetite
and
a
hungry
stomach
does
let
one
think
of
much
else
so
after
a
day
or
two
reddy
grew
brave
enough
to
go
hunting
somehow
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
safer
to
hunt
during
the
day
instead
of
during
the
night
you
see
it
was
only
after
jolly
round
red
sun
had
gone
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
that
that
strange
voice
was
heard
and
reddy
guessed
that
perhaps
the
stranger
slept
during
the
day
so
reddy
started
out
very
early
in
the
morning
stepping
as
softly
as
he
knew
how
looking
behind
every
bush
and
tree
and
with
his
sharp
little
ears
wide
open
to
catch
every
sound
every
few
feet
he
stopped
and
sniffed
the
wind
very
carefully
for
reddy
nose
can
tell
him
of
things
which
his
eyes
do
not
see
and
his
ears
do
not
hear
and
all
the
time
he
was
ready
to
run
at
the
first
sign
of
danger
he
had
left
the
green
forest
and
was
out
on
the
green
meadows
hoping
to
catch
danny
meadow
mouse
when
that
sharp
little
nose
of
his
was
tickled
by
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
with
a
smell
that
reddy
knew
reddy
turned
and
went
in
the
direction
from
which
the
merry
little
breeze
had
come
just
a
few
steps
he
went
and
then
he
stopped
and
sniffed
said
reddy
to
himself
that
smells
to
me
like
chicken
it
certainly
does
smell
like
chicken
very
very
slowly
and
carefully
reddy
moved
forward
in
the
direction
from
which
that
delicious
smell
came
every
few
steps
he
stopped
and
sniffed
sniff
sniff
sniff
yes
it
certainly
was
chicken
mouth
watered
a
few
more
steps
and
there
a
little
way
in
front
of
him
partly
hidden
in
a
clump
of
tall
grass
and
bushes
lay
a
chicken
reddy
stopped
short
and
sat
down
to
look
at
it
then
he
looked
all
around
it
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
about
then
he
walked
clear
around
it
in
a
circle
but
he
was
very
careful
not
to
go
too
near
finally
he
sat
down
again
where
he
could
smell
the
chicken
his
tongue
hung
out
with
longing
and
water
dripped
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
his
stomach
said
go
get
it
but
his
head
said
do
go
any
nearer
it
may
be
some
sort
of
a
then
reddy
remembered
one
of
the
sayings
of
wise
old
granny
fox
when
you
are
tempted
very
much
just
turn
your
back
and
go
away
temptation
then
can
harm
you
not
but
only
those
who
choose
to
i
hate
to
do
it
but
i
guess
it
the
best
way
said
reddy
fox
and
turned
his
back
on
the
chicken
and
trotted
away
iv
reddy
fox
consults
bobby
coon
reddy
fox
had
turned
his
back
on
the
chicken
that
he
had
found
hidden
in
a
bunch
of
grass
and
bushes
on
the
green
meadows
it
had
been
the
hardest
thing
to
do
that
reddy
could
remember
for
his
stomach
fairly
ached
he
was
so
hungry
but
there
might
be
danger
there
and
it
was
best
to
be
safe
so
reddy
turned
and
trotted
away
where
he
could
neither
see
nor
smell
that
chicken
he
caught
some
grasshoppers
and
he
found
a
family
of
fat
beetles
they
were
not
very
filling
but
they
were
better
than
nothing
after
a
while
he
felt
better
and
he
curled
up
in
a
warm
sunny
spot
to
rest
and
think
it
may
be
that
farmer
brown
boy
has
set
a
trap
there
said
reddy
to
himself
then
he
remembered
that
the
chicken
was
and
he
knew
that
it
likely
that
farmer
brown
boy
would
have
a
chicken
unless
he
had
found
one
that
jimmy
skunk
had
left
near
the
and
for
some
reason
he
did
know
he
had
a
feeling
that
jimmy
skunk
had
not
had
anything
to
do
with
that
chicken
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
felt
sure
that
that
chicken
had
something
to
do
with
the
stranger
whose
voice
had
brought
so
much
fear
to
the
green
meadows
the
very
thought
made
him
nervous
and
spoiled
his
i
believe
i
run
over
and
see
bobby
coon
said
reddy
and
off
he
started
for
the
green
forest
bobby
coon
bad
been
out
all
night
but
he
had
not
been
very
far
away
from
his
because
he
too
had
felt
little
chills
of
fear
when
he
heard
that
strange
voice
which
was
the
voice
of
hooty
the
owl
or
of
dippy
the
loon
or
of
a
little
yelping
dog
and
yet
sounded
something
like
all
three
together
so
bobby
stomach
was
as
full
as
usual
and
he
felt
cross
and
uncomfortable
you
know
it
is
hard
work
to
feel
hungry
and
pleasant
at
the
same
time
he
had
just
begun
to
doze
when
he
heard
reddy
fox
calling
softly
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
bobby
bobby
coon
called
reddy
bobby
did
answer
he
kept
perfectly
still
to
try
to
make
reddy
think
that
he
was
asleep
but
reddy
kept
right
on
calling
finally
bobby
scrambled
up
to
the
doorway
of
his
house
in
the
big
and
scowled
down
at
reddy
fox
well
what
is
it
he
snapped
crossly
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
disturb
people
who
are
trying
to
get
a
little
honest
reddy
grinned
i
very
sorry
to
wake
you
up
bobby
coon
said
reddy
but
you
see
i
want
your
advice
i
know
that
there
is
no
one
smarter
than
you
and
i
have
just
discovered
something
very
important
about
which
i
want
to
know
what
you
the
scowl
disappeared
from
bobby
coon
face
he
felt
very
much
flattered
just
as
reddy
meant
that
he
should
feel
and
he
tried
to
look
very
important
and
wise
as
he
said
i
listening
reddy
fox
what
is
it
that
is
so
important
then
reddy
told
him
all
about
the
chicken
over
on
the
green
meadows
and
how
he
suspected
that
the
stranger
with
the
terrible
voice
had
had
something
to
do
with
it
bobby
listened
gravely
pooh
said
he
probably
jimmy
skunk
knows
something
about
no
replied
reddy
i
sure
that
jimmy
skunk
does
know
anything
about
it
come
over
with
me
and
see
it
for
bobby
began
to
back
down
into
his
house
you
have
to
excuse
me
this
morning
reddy
fox
you
see
i
very
tired
and
need
sleep
said
he
reddy
turned
his
head
aside
to
hide
a
smile
for
he
knew
that
bobby
was
afraid
i
sure
it
must
have
been
jimmy
skunk
continued
bobby
why
you
go
ask
him
i
never
like
to
meddle
with
other
people
and
with
that
bobby
coon
backed
down
out
of
sight
in
the
reddy
fox
visits
jimmy
skunk
coon
is
afraid
yes
sir
bobby
coon
is
afraid
he
does
dare
go
with
me
to
look
at
that
chicken
over
on
the
green
meadows
he
a
coward
that
what
he
is
reddy
fox
muttered
this
to
himself
as
he
trotted
away
from
bobby
big
in
the
green
forest
reddy
was
right
and
he
was
wrong
he
was
right
in
thinking
that
bobby
coon
was
afraid
bobby
afraid
but
that
did
make
him
a
coward
you
see
he
could
see
what
good
it
would
do
him
to
go
see
that
chicken
way
out
there
in
the
green
meadows
so
far
away
from
trees
bobby
is
like
happy
jack
squirrel
he
never
feels
really
safe
unless
there
is
a
tree
close
at
hand
to
climb
for
bobby
legs
are
not
very
long
and
though
he
can
run
fast
for
a
little
distance
he
soon
gets
out
of
breath
then
he
climbs
the
nearest
tree
but
if
there
had
been
any
really
good
reason
for
going
bobby
would
have
gone
even
though
he
was
afraid
and
that
shows
that
he
was
a
coward
but
reddy
fox
likes
to
think
himself
very
brave
and
every
one
else
a
coward
so
he
trotted
along
with
his
nose
turned
up
in
scorn
because
bobby
coon
was
afraid
he
was
disappointed
too
was
reddy
fox
you
see
he
had
hoped
to
get
bobby
to
go
with
him
and
when
they
got
there
that
bobby
would
go
close
to
the
chicken
and
try
to
find
out
who
had
left
it
on
the
green
meadows
and
for
what
reason
reddy
who
is
always
suspicious
thought
that
there
might
be
a
trap
and
if
so
bobby
would
find
it
and
then
reddy
would
know
without
running
any
danger
himself
that
shows
how
sly
he
is
but
as
long
as
bobby
would
go
there
was
nothing
for
reddy
to
do
but
to
try
the
same
plan
with
jimmy
skunk
and
so
he
headed
straight
for
jimmy
skunk
house
now
deep
down
in
his
heart
reddy
fox
hated
jimmy
skunk
and
more
than
once
he
had
tried
to
get
jimmy
into
trouble
but
now
as
he
saw
jimmy
sitting
on
his
doorstep
reddy
looked
as
pleasant
as
only
reddy
can
he
smiled
as
if
jimmy
were
his
very
best
friend
good
morning
jimmy
skunk
i
glad
to
see
you
said
reddy
i
hope
you
are
feeling
well
this
now
jimmy
had
had
a
good
breakfast
of
fat
beetles
and
he
was
feeling
very
but
he
was
fooled
by
reddy
pleasant
ways
to
himself
he
thought
i
wonder
what
mischief
reddy
fox
is
up
to
but
aloud
he
said
good
morning
reddy
fox
you
are
looking
very
fine
and
handsome
this
morning
of
course
no
one
who
is
as
big
and
brave
as
you
are
is
afraid
of
the
stranger
with
the
terrible
voice
who
has
frightened
the
rest
of
us
so
for
the
last
few
now
all
the
time
he
was
saying
this
jimmy
knew
perfectly
well
that
reddy
was
afraid
and
he
turned
his
head
to
hide
a
smile
as
reddy
swelled
up
to
look
very
big
and
important
and
replied
oh
my
no
no
indeed
certainly
not
i
not
afraid
of
anybody
or
anything
by
the
way
i
saw
a
strange
thing
down
on
the
green
meadows
early
this
morning
it
was
a
chicken
hidden
in
a
clump
of
grass
and
bushes
i
wondered
if
you
left
it
jimmy
skunk
pricked
up
his
ears
no
said
he
i
did
leave
it
there
i
have
taken
a
chicken
from
farmer
brown
this
spring
and
i
have
been
up
to
his
for
more
than
a
week
who
do
you
suppose
could
have
left
it
there
i
have
the
least
idea
unless
reddy
looked
this
way
and
that
to
make
sure
that
they
were
alone
unless
it
was
the
stranger
who
has
frightened
every
one
but
me
he
finished
in
a
whisper
jimmy
pricked
his
ears
up
more
than
ever
do
you
really
suppose
it
could
have
been
he
asked
come
down
there
with
me
and
see
for
yourself
replied
reddy
and
jimmy
said
he
would
vi
jimmy
skunk
goes
with
reddy
fox
skunk
and
reddy
fox
trotted
along
down
the
crooked
little
path
to
the
green
meadows
reddy
was
impatient
and
in
a
hurry
but
jimmy
skunk
never
hurries
and
he
did
now
he
just
took
his
time
and
reddy
fox
had
to
keep
waiting
for
him
reddy
was
nervous
and
anxious
he
kept
turning
his
head
this
way
and
that
way
he
looked
behind
every
little
bush
and
clump
of
grass
he
cocked
his
sharp
ears
at
every
little
sound
he
sniffed
every
little
breeze
it
was
very
plain
that
reddy
fox
was
ill
at
ease
hurry
up
jimmy
skunk
hurry
up
he
urged
every
few
minutes
and
he
had
hard
work
to
make
his
voice
sound
pleasant
but
jimmy
did
hurry
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
jimmy
were
slower
than
usual
the
more
impatient
reddy
grew
the
slower
jimmy
seemed
to
go
and
every
time
reddy
back
was
turned
jimmy
would
grin
and
his
sharp
little
eyes
twinkled
with
mischief
you
see
he
knew
that
despite
all
his
boasting
reddy
fox
afraid
and
because
he
was
afraid
himself
jimmy
was
getting
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
watching
reddy
once
when
reddy
had
stopped
to
look
over
the
green
meadows
jimmy
stole
up
behind
him
very
softly
and
suddenly
pulled
reddy
tail
reddy
sprang
forward
with
a
frightened
yelp
and
started
to
run
as
only
reddy
can
then
he
heard
jimmy
skunk
laughing
and
knew
that
jimmy
had
played
a
joke
on
him
he
stopped
short
and
whirled
around
what
are
you
laughing
at
jimmy
skunk
he
shouted
angrily
oh
nothing
nothing
at
all
replied
jimmy
and
his
face
was
as
sober
as
if
he
never
had
laughed
and
never
could
laugh
reddy
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
ugly
but
suddenly
remembered
that
if
he
quarrelled
with
jimmy
skunk
then
jimmy
would
go
any
farther
with
him
so
he
gulped
down
his
anger
as
best
he
could
and
grinned
sheepishly
while
he
waited
for
jimmy
to
catch
up
with
him
so
at
last
they
came
to
the
bunch
of
grass
and
bushes
in
which
reddy
had
found
the
chicken
early
that
morning
there
it
lay
just
as
reddy
had
left
it
reddy
stopped
at
a
safe
distance
and
pointed
it
out
to
jimmy
skunk
jimmy
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
who
do
you
suppose
could
have
brought
it
away
down
here
on
the
green
meadows
whispered
reddy
as
if
afraid
that
some
one
might
overhear
him
jimmy
skunk
scratched
his
head
as
if
thinking
very
hard
it
might
have
been
redtail
the
hawk
said
he
at
last
that
so
i
did
think
of
him
replied
reddy
but
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
were
left
there
in
the
night
and
redtail
never
hunts
at
night
because
his
eyes
are
for
seeing
in
the
daytime
and
not
in
the
dark
added
jimmy
skunk
let
go
closer
and
perhaps
we
can
tell
who
left
it
of
course
that
a
good
idea
replied
reddy
starting
forward
as
if
he
were
going
to
walk
right
up
to
the
chicken
after
a
few
steps
he
stopped
as
if
he
had
a
sudden
thought
i
tell
you
what
said
he
one
of
us
had
better
keep
watch
to
see
that
no
danger
is
near
i
am
taller
than
you
and
can
see
over
the
grass
better
than
you
can
so
i
keep
watch
while
you
see
what
you
can
find
now
jimmy
skunk
saw
through
reddy
plan
right
away
but
jimmy
afraid
because
he
is
afraid
of
much
of
anything
so
he
agreed
while
reddy
kept
watch
he
carefully
made
his
way
to
the
chicken
hidden
in
the
clump
of
grass
and
bushes
all
the
time
he
kept
his
eyes
wide
open
for
traps
but
there
were
no
traps
there
he
was
gone
a
long
time
and
when
at
last
he
came
out
his
face
was
very
sober
well
was
it
redtail
the
hawk
asked
reddy
eagerly
no
said
jimmy
no
it
was
redtail
the
hawk
or
hooty
the
owl
it
was
some
one
with
teeth
very
much
like
yours
reddy
fox
only
bigger
and
with
feet
very
much
like
yours
only
these
were
bigger
too
and
the
chicken
was
one
of
farmer
brown
at
all
it
was
brought
from
somewhere
farther
away
than
farmer
brown
and
that
shows
that
it
was
some
one
smarter
than
you
reddy
fox
because
whoever
it
was
knew
that
if
they
stole
a
chicken
from
farmer
brown
his
boy
and
bowser
the
hound
would
come
looking
for
vii
a
call
on
digger
the
badger
for
fox
or
man
the
better
plan
with
unknown
danger
near
is
to
go
home
and
no
more
roam
until
the
way
be
clear
is
what
reddy
fox
thinks
the
thought
popped
right
into
his
head
when
jimmy
skunk
told
him
that
the
chicken
had
been
left
on
the
green
meadows
by
some
one
with
teeth
and
feet
very
like
reddy
own
but
bigger
but
reddy
pretended
not
to
believe
it
pooh
said
he
how
do
you
know
that
this
stranger
has
feet
like
mine
only
bigger
you
have
seen
him
have
you
no
said
jimmy
skunk
shaking
his
head
no
i
have
seen
him
and
i
do
need
to
to
know
that
his
footprints
are
right
over
here
in
the
sand
come
look
for
yourself
reddy
no
thanks
said
reddy
hastily
the
fact
is
i
have
some
very
important
matters
to
look
after
in
the
green
forest
and
i
must
hurry
along
you
excuse
me
wo
you
jimmy
skunk
if
you
say
that
there
are
footprints
like
mine
only
larger
of
course
i
believe
it
i
would
stop
to
look
at
them
if
i
could
but
i
find
that
i
am
already
very
late
by
the
way
if
you
will
look
a
little
closer
at
those
footprints
i
think
you
will
find
that
they
were
made
by
a
dog
i
sorry
i
ca
wait
for
you
but
you
are
such
a
slow
walker
that
i
really
have
the
time
let
me
know
if
you
find
out
anything
about
this
and
with
that
off
he
started
for
the
green
forest
jimmy
skunk
grinned
for
he
knew
that
reddy
had
nothing
more
important
to
attend
to
than
to
get
away
as
fast
as
he
could
from
a
place
which
he
felt
might
be
dangerous
do
fool
yourself
reddy
fox
by
thinking
i
do
know
the
footprints
of
a
dog
when
i
see
them
besides
i
smelled
of
them
and
they
smell
of
dog
shouted
jimmy
before
reddy
could
get
out
of
hearing
jimmy
watched
reddy
out
of
sight
and
chuckled
as
he
saw
reddy
keep
turning
to
look
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
expected
to
find
something
terrible
at
his
heels
i
never
run
away
until
i
knew
what
i
was
running
from
exclaimed
jimmy
with
the
greatest
scorn
did
you
ever
see
such
a
coward
with
reddy
gone
jimmy
thoughts
came
back
to
the
queer
things
which
were
driving
all
the
happiness
from
the
green
meadows
at
the
very
happiest
time
of
all
the
year
there
was
that
strange
terrible
voice
in
the
night
the
voice
that
was
not
that
of
hooty
the
owl
or
dippy
the
loon
or
a
little
yelping
dog
yet
which
sounded
something
like
all
three
and
which
was
frightening
all
the
little
people
until
they
were
afraid
to
move
out
of
sight
of
their
homes
and
here
was
this
chicken
hidden
in
the
clump
of
grass
and
hushes
on
the
green
meadows
by
some
one
with
teeth
and
feet
very
much
like
those
of
reddy
fox
only
bigger
it
was
all
very
queer
very
queer
indeed
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
jimmy
felt
sure
that
the
owner
of
the
terrible
voice
was
the
owner
of
the
big
teeth
and
the
maker
of
the
strange
footprints
he
was
scratching
his
head
as
he
puzzled
over
the
matter
when
he
happened
to
look
over
to
the
home
of
digger
the
badger
jimmy
eyes
brightened
i
believe
i
make
a
call
on
digger
perhaps
he
will
know
something
about
it
said
he
and
off
he
started
digger
the
badger
sat
on
his
doorstep
he
has
very
few
friends
for
he
is
grumpy
and
very
apt
to
be
out
of
sorts
besides
most
of
the
little
meadow
people
are
afraid
of
him
but
jimmy
skunk
is
afraid
of
any
one
but
farmer
brown
boy
and
not
even
of
him
unless
he
has
his
terrible
gun
so
he
walked
right
up
to
the
doorstep
where
digger
the
badger
was
sitting
illustration
good
morning
said
jimmy
politely
morning
grunted
digger
the
badger
what
do
you
think
of
the
queer
doings
on
the
green
meadows
asked
jimmy
what
queer
doings
asked
digger
then
jimmy
skunk
told
all
about
the
strange
voice
and
the
strange
footprints
digger
the
badger
did
say
a
word
until
jimmy
was
through
then
he
chuckled
why
said
he
that
is
only
my
old
friend
from
the
great
west
old
man
viii
old
man
coyote
makes
himself
at
home
was
out
at
last
digger
the
badger
had
told
jimmy
skunk
who
it
was
that
had
so
frightened
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
with
his
terrible
voice
and
jimmy
skunk
had
straightway
sent
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
over
to
the
smiling
pool
up
along
the
laughing
brook
through
the
green
forest
and
over
the
green
meadows
to
spread
the
news
that
it
was
old
man
coyote
from
the
great
west
who
had
come
to
make
his
home
on
the
green
meadows
and
that
night
when
they
heard
his
voice
somehow
it
did
sound
so
terrible
you
see
they
knew
who
it
was
and
that
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
the
shivers
still
might
crawl
and
creep
and
chase
away
good
friendly
sleep
but
knowing
whom
he
had
to
fear
brought
to
each
heart
a
bit
of
cheer
that
may
seem
a
bit
queer
but
it
was
so
you
see
not
knowing
what
or
whom
to
be
afraid
of
made
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
afraid
every
minute
of
the
time
afraid
to
sleep
afraid
to
put
their
noses
out
of
their
homes
almost
afraid
to
draw
a
long
breath
but
now
that
they
knew
it
was
old
man
coyote
who
had
so
frightened
them
they
felt
better
for
digger
the
badger
who
had
known
him
in
the
great
west
where
they
had
been
neighbors
had
told
jimmy
skunk
what
he
looked
like
and
jimmy
skunk
had
spread
the
news
so
that
everybody
would
know
old
man
coyote
when
they
saw
him
so
though
each
one
knew
that
he
must
give
old
man
coyote
a
chance
to
catch
him
each
felt
sure
right
down
in
his
heart
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
be
just
a
little
bit
smarter
than
old
man
coyote
and
he
would
be
safe
of
course
it
did
take
old
man
coyote
long
to
learn
that
he
had
been
found
out
he
grinned
to
himself
stretched
and
yawned
and
then
came
out
from
his
secret
hiding
place
i
think
i
call
on
my
neighbors
said
he
and
trotted
towards
the
house
of
digger
the
badger
the
merry
little
breezes
saw
him
first
and
in
a
great
flutter
of
excitement
they
hurried
this
way
and
that
way
to
tell
everybody
that
the
stranger
from
the
great
west
had
come
out
in
the
light
of
day
my
my
my
such
a
scampering
as
there
was
for
a
safe
place
from
which
to
peep
out
at
old
man
coyote
he
pretended
not
to
notice
and
did
look
this
way
or
that
way
but
trotted
on
about
his
own
business
digger
the
badger
was
sitting
on
his
doorstep
and
he
grinned
when
he
saw
old
man
coyote
coming
it
about
time
you
called
on
your
old
friend
said
he
it
was
old
man
coyote
turn
to
grin
that
so
brother
badger
he
replied
but
the
fact
is
i
been
living
very
excepting
at
night
said
digger
showing
all
his
teeth
in
a
rather
broad
grin
you
voice
certainly
has
sounded
good
to
i
guess
it
the
first
time
interrupted
old
man
coyote
the
first
time
i
heard
it
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
continued
digger
just
as
if
he
had
heard
what
old
man
coyote
said
seems
just
like
home
to
have
you
about
but
tell
me
how
does
it
happen
that
you
have
come
here
out
of
the
great
west
that
too
long
a
story
to
tell
now
anyway
i
might
ask
you
the
same
thing
but
here
i
am
and
i
believe
i
stay
i
like
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
now
i
must
be
going
along
to
call
on
the
rest
of
my
new
neighbors
i
hope
they
be
glad
to
see
old
man
coyote
grinned
again
when
he
said
this
for
no
one
knew
better
than
he
did
how
very
much
afraid
of
him
his
new
neighbors
were
come
again
when
you
can
stop
longer
said
digger
the
badger
i
will
replied
old
man
coyote
starting
toward
the
smiling
pool
ix
old
man
coyote
meets
reddy
fox
no
matter
how
you
feel
inside
hold
up
your
head
call
up
your
pride
stand
fast
look
brave
then
none
will
guess
the
fear
you
feel
but
wo
confess
skunk
learned
this
when
he
was
a
very
little
fellow
now
he
afraid
of
much
of
anything
but
there
was
a
time
when
he
was
oh
my
yes
there
was
a
time
when
he
first
started
out
to
see
the
world
and
before
he
had
found
out
that
all
the
world
is
afraid
of
that
little
bag
of
scent
he
always
carries
with
him
when
jimmy
often
was
as
frightened
as
peter
rabbit
ever
is
and
you
know
peter
is
very
easily
frightened
but
jimmy
used
to
think
of
that
little
verse
and
though
sometimes
he
had
to
shut
his
mouth
as
tightly
as
he
knew
how
to
keep
his
teeth
from
chattering
with
fear
he
would
hold
up
his
head
stand
fast
and
look
brave
what
do
you
think
happened
why
in
a
little
while
people
began
to
say
that
jimmy
skunk
was
afraid
of
anything
and
so
no
one
tried
to
bother
him
of
course
when
he
found
this
out
jimmy
was
afraid
but
reddy
fox
is
different
he
dearly
loves
to
tell
how
brave
he
is
he
brags
and
boasts
but
when
he
finds
himself
in
a
place
where
he
is
afraid
he
shows
it
yes
sir
he
shows
it
reddy
fox
has
never
learned
to
stand
fast
and
look
brave
when
reddy
had
first
been
told
that
the
stranger
with
the
voice
which
had
sounded
so
terrible
in
the
night
was
old
man
coyote
from
the
great
west
and
that
he
had
decided
to
make
his
home
on
the
green
meadows
reddy
had
said
pooh
i
not
afraid
of
him
and
had
swelled
himself
up
and
strutted
back
and
forth
as
if
he
really
meant
it
but
all
the
time
reddy
took
care
the
very
greatest
care
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
old
man
coyote
of
course
some
one
told
digger
the
badger
what
reddy
had
said
and
digger
told
old
man
coyote
who
just
grinned
and
said
nothing
but
he
noticed
how
careful
reddy
was
to
keep
out
of
his
way
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
like
to
meet
reddy
and
find
out
how
brave
he
really
was
so
one
moonlight
night
he
hid
behind
a
big
log
near
one
of
favorite
hunting
places
pretty
soon
reddy
came
tiptoeing
along
watching
for
foolish
young
mice
just
a
little
while
before
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
old
man
coyote
way
over
on
the
edge
of
the
old
pasture
so
he
never
once
thought
of
meeting
him
here
just
as
he
passed
the
end
of
the
old
log
a
deep
voice
in
the
black
shadow
said
good
evening
brother
reddy
whirled
about
his
heart
seemed
to
come
right
up
in
his
throat
it
was
too
late
to
run
for
there
was
old
man
coyote
right
in
front
of
him
reddy
tried
to
swell
himself
up
just
as
he
so
often
did
before
the
little
people
who
were
afraid
of
him
but
somehow
he
could
evening
coyote
he
replied
but
his
voice
sounded
very
weak
i
hear
you
come
to
make
your
home
on
the
green
meadows
hope
we
will
be
the
best
of
of
course
we
will
replied
old
man
coyote
i
always
the
best
of
friends
with
those
who
are
not
afraid
of
me
and
i
hear
that
you
are
not
afraid
of
not
afraid
of
anybody
said
reddy
everybody
is
afraid
of
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
he
was
slowly
backing
away
and
in
spite
of
his
bold
words
he
was
shaking
with
fear
old
man
coyote
saw
it
and
he
chuckled
to
himself
i
not
brother
fox
he
suddenly
snapped
in
a
deep
horrid
sounding
voice
i
not
as
he
said
it
all
the
hair
along
his
back
stood
on
end
and
he
showed
all
his
great
teeth
instead
of
holding
his
ground
as
jimmy
skunk
would
have
done
reddy
leaped
backward
tripped
over
his
own
tail
fell
and
then
scrambled
to
his
feet
with
a
frightened
yelp
and
ran
as
he
had
never
run
before
in
all
his
life
and
as
he
ran
he
heard
old
man
coyote
laughing
and
all
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
heard
it
ho
ho
ho
ha
ha
ha
hee
hee
hee
ho
ha
hee
ho
reddy
fox
afraid
ho
ho
reddy
ground
his
teeth
in
rage
but
he
kept
on
running
granny
fox
visits
prickly
porky
i
often
heard
old
granny
say
he
longest
lives
who
runs
away
fox
did
realize
that
he
was
speaking
aloud
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
think
that
he
was
a
coward
and
that
in
running
away
from
old
man
coyote
he
had
done
only
what
every
one
of
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
would
have
done
in
his
place
so
without
knowing
it
he
had
spoken
aloud
but
he
who
runs
must
leave
behind
his
and
peace
of
the
voice
came
from
right
over
reddy
head
but
he
did
have
to
look
up
to
know
who
was
there
it
was
sammy
jay
of
course
sammy
is
always
on
hand
when
he
is
wanted
and
reddy
knew
by
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
sammy
knew
about
the
meeting
with
old
man
coyote
what
are
you
waiting
around
here
for
asked
reddy
with
a
snarl
to
tell
old
granny
fox
how
brave
you
are
retorted
sammy
jay
his
eyes
sparkling
with
mischief
and
how
fast
you
can
you
better
mind
your
own
affairs
and
leave
mine
alone
i
shall
tell
granny
all
about
it
myself
anyway
snapped
reddy
now
when
reddy
said
that
he
did
tell
the
truth
for
he
had
no
intention
of
telling
old
granny
fox
of
how
he
had
run
from
old
man
coyote
but
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
old
granny
fox
herself
stepped
out
from
behind
a
bush
she
had
been
up
in
the
old
pasture
for
a
week
or
two
and
had
just
come
back
so
she
knew
nothing
of
the
fright
which
old
man
coyote
had
given
those
who
live
in
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
i
already
to
listen
right
now
reddy
said
she
reddy
hung
his
head
he
coughed
and
cleared
his
throat
and
tried
to
think
of
some
way
out
of
it
but
it
was
of
no
use
there
sat
sammy
jay
ready
to
tell
if
he
did
and
so
mumbling
so
low
that
twice
granny
told
him
to
speak
louder
reddy
told
how
he
had
run
and
how
old
man
coyote
had
laughed
at
him
so
that
all
the
little
people
in
the
green
forest
and
on
the
green
meadows
had
heard
of
course
he
laughed
snapped
old
granny
fox
you
a
coward
reddy
fox
just
a
plain
coward
it
all
well
enough
to
run
away
when
you
know
you
have
to
but
to
run
before
there
is
anything
to
be
afraid
of
shows
you
are
the
biggest
kind
of
a
coward
bah
get
out
of
my
sight
reddy
slunk
away
muttering
to
himself
and
glaring
angrily
at
sammy
jay
who
was
chuckling
with
delight
to
see
reddy
looking
so
uncomfortable
old
granny
fox
made
sure
that
reddy
was
out
of
sight
and
then
she
sat
down
to
think
and
there
was
a
worried
pucker
in
her
forehead
old
man
coyote
is
a
wolf
said
she
talking
to
herself
and
a
wolf
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
will
mean
hard
hunting
for
reddy
and
me
when
food
is
scarce
it
is
of
no
use
for
me
to
fight
him
for
he
is
bigger
and
stronger
than
i
am
i
just
have
to
make
all
the
trouble
for
him
that
i
can
and
then
perhaps
he
go
away
i
wonder
if
he
has
ever
met
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
i
believe
i
go
over
and
make
prickly
porky
a
call
right
now
and
as
she
trotted
through
the
green
forest
on
her
way
to
call
on
prickly
porky
her
thoughts
were
very
busy
very
busy
indeed
she
was
planning
trouble
for
old
man
coyote
xi
granny
fox
tells
prickly
porky
a
story
a
little
tale
which
is
true
and
eager
ears
to
heed
it
means
trouble
starts
right
there
to
brew
with
to
feed
it
one
knows
how
true
this
is
better
than
does
old
and
no
one
knows
better
than
she
how
to
make
trouble
for
other
people
by
starting
little
untrue
stories
you
see
she
learned
long
ago
how
fast
a
mean
little
tale
will
travel
once
it
has
been
started
and
so
when
there
is
some
one
with
whom
she
is
afraid
to
fight
honestly
she
uses
these
little
untrue
tales
instead
of
claws
and
teeth
and
often
they
hurt
a
great
deal
worse
than
claws
or
teeth
ever
could
now
you
would
think
that
by
this
time
all
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
would
have
found
old
granny
fox
out
and
that
they
believe
her
stories
but
the
truth
is
most
people
are
very
apt
to
believe
unpleasant
things
about
other
people
without
taking
the
trouble
to
find
out
if
they
are
true
and
old
granny
fox
knows
this
besides
she
is
smart
enough
to
tell
these
little
untrue
stories
as
if
she
had
heard
them
from
some
one
else
so
of
course
some
one
else
gets
the
blame
for
starting
them
oh
granny
fox
is
smart
and
sly
yes
siree
she
certainly
is
smart
and
sly
it
was
one
of
her
plans
to
make
trouble
that
was
taking
her
over
to
see
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
she
found
him
as
usual
in
the
top
of
a
poplar
tree
filling
his
stomach
with
tender
young
bark
granny
strolled
along
as
if
she
had
just
happened
to
pass
that
way
and
not
as
if
she
had
come
purposely
she
pretended
to
be
very
much
surprised
when
she
looked
up
and
saw
prickly
porky
good
morning
prickly
porky
she
said
in
her
pleasantest
voice
how
big
and
fine
and
strong
and
brave
you
are
looking
this
morning
prickly
porky
stopped
eating
and
looked
down
at
her
suspiciously
but
just
the
same
he
felt
pleased
huh
he
grunted
then
once
more
he
began
to
eat
granny
pox
went
right
on
talking
i
said
when
i
heard
that
story
this
morning
that
i
did
believe
a
word
of
it
i
what
story
prickly
porky
broke
in
why
have
you
heard
it
granny
spoke
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
billy
mink
told
it
to
me
he
said
that
this
stranger
old
man
coyote
who
has
come
to
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
has
been
boasting
that
he
is
afraid
of
nobody
but
everybody
is
afraid
of
him
when
somebody
asked
him
if
you
were
afraid
of
him
he
said
that
you
climbed
the
highest
tree
you
could
find
if
you
but
saw
his
shadow
of
course
i
did
believe
it
because
i
know
that
you
are
not
afraid
of
anybody
but
other
people
believe
it
and
they
do
say
that
old
man
coyote
is
bragging
that
the
first
time
he
meets
you
on
the
ground
he
is
going
to
have
porcupine
for
prickly
porky
had
started
down
the
tree
before
granny
finished
speaking
and
his
usually
dull
eyes
actually
looked
bright
the
fact
is
they
were
bright
with
anger
prickly
porky
looked
positively
fierce
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
granny
fox
backing
away
a
little
going
to
give
that
boaster
a
chance
to
try
to
get
his
porcupine
dinner
grunted
prickly
porky
granny
turned
aside
to
grin
i
do
believe
you
will
find
him
now
said
she
but
i
heard
that
he
is
planning
to
get
you
when
you
go
down
to
the
laughing
brook
for
a
drink
this
then
i
wait
grunted
prickly
porky
so
granny
fox
bade
him
and
started
on
with
a
wicked
chuckle
to
think
how
prickly
porky
had
believed
the
story
which
she
had
made
up
xii
granny
fox
tells
another
story
believe
all
the
good
that
you
may
hear
but
always
doubt
the
bad
pass
on
the
word
of
kindly
cheer
forget
the
tale
that
sad
every
one
would
do
that
what
a
different
world
this
would
he
my
my
my
yes
indeed
there
would
be
any
place
for
the
granny
foxes
who
start
untrue
stories
just
to
make
trouble
but
we
will
have
to
say
this
much
for
old
granny
fox
she
seldom
does
make
trouble
just
for
the
sake
of
trouble
no
sir
old
granny
fox
seldom
very
seldom
makes
trouble
unless
she
or
reddy
fox
have
something
to
gain
by
it
she
is
too
smart
and
wise
for
that
it
was
just
this
way
now
you
see
she
felt
down
in
her
heart
that
old
man
coyote
the
wolf
had
no
right
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
he
was
a
stranger
from
the
great
west
and
she
felt
that
she
and
reddy
fox
had
the
best
right
there
because
they
had
been
born
there
and
always
had
lived
there
and
she
was
afraid
very
much
afraid
that
there
would
be
room
for
them
and
for
old
man
coyote
but
she
was
big
or
strong
enough
to
fight
him
and
drive
him
away
and
so
the
only
thing
she
could
think
of
was
to
make
him
so
much
trouble
that
he
would
leave
she
had
begun
by
telling
an
untrue
story
to
prickly
porky
a
story
which
had
made
prickly
porky
very
angry
with
old
man
coyote
although
they
had
never
met
now
she
was
hurrying
down
to
the
smiling
pool
on
the
banks
of
which
old
man
coyote
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
a
she
had
been
told
sure
enough
when
she
came
in
sight
of
the
smiling
pool
there
he
lay
sprawled
out
in
the
sun
and
talking
to
grandfather
frog
who
sat
on
his
big
green
well
out
of
reach
from
the
shore
granny
came
up
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
smiling
pool
from
where
old
man
coyote
lay
how
do
you
do
coyote
i
have
just
heard
that
you
have
come
here
to
make
your
home
among
us
and
i
am
sure
we
all
give
you
a
hearty
granny
said
this
just
as
if
she
really
meant
it
and
all
the
time
she
was
speaking
she
was
smiling
old
man
coyote
watched
her
out
of
eyes
and
to
himself
he
thought
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
granny
fox
is
too
polite
altogether
too
polite
i
wonder
what
kind
of
a
trick
she
is
trying
to
play
all
the
time
he
was
saying
this
old
man
coyote
was
chuckling
inside
but
aloud
he
said
and
his
voice
was
just
as
smooth
and
soft
and
pleasant
as
granny
i
very
well
thank
you
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
hearty
welcome
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
the
best
of
illustration
now
all
the
time
he
was
saying
this
old
man
coyote
was
chuckling
inside
for
he
knew
well
enough
that
they
would
be
friends
and
that
granny
fox
did
want
to
be
friends
you
see
he
is
quite
as
sharp
as
she
yes
indeed
i
am
sure
we
shall
replied
old
granny
fox
how
big
and
strong
you
are
coyote
i
should
think
that
you
would
be
afraid
of
old
man
coyote
looked
flattered
i
not
said
he
granny
fox
raised
her
eyebrows
as
if
very
much
surprised
is
that
so
she
exclaimed
why
i
heard
that
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
is
boasting
that
you
are
afraid
of
him
and
do
dare
put
your
foot
in
the
green
forest
when
he
is
old
man
coyote
suddenly
jumped
to
his
feet
and
there
was
an
ugly
gleam
in
his
yellow
eyes
granny
fox
was
glad
that
she
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
smiling
pool
i
do
know
who
this
prickly
porky
is
said
he
but
if
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
where
i
can
find
him
i
think
i
will
make
him
a
call
at
probably
he
taking
a
nap
in
a
just
now
replied
granny
but
it
you
really
want
to
meet
him
you
find
him
getting
a
drink
at
the
laughing
brook
in
the
green
forest
late
this
afternoon
i
do
hope
that
you
will
be
careful
careful
careful
snorted
he
there
wo
be
any
prickly
porky
when
i
get
through
with
him
said
grandfather
frog
and
looked
very
hard
at
old
granny
fox
granny
winked
the
eye
that
was
nearest
to
him
xiii
the
meeting
at
the
laughing
brook
the
trouble
with
a
quarrel
is
that
when
it
once
begun
the
whole
world
tries
to
push
it
on
and
seems
to
think
it
fun
usually
is
anything
but
fun
for
those
engaged
in
it
but
their
neighbors
crowd
about
and
urge
them
on
and
do
their
best
to
make
matters
worse
it
was
just
that
way
when
prickly
porcupine
and
old
man
coyote
met
beside
the
laughing
brook
now
until
they
met
here
neither
had
ever
seen
the
other
for
you
know
old
man
coyote
had
come
out
of
the
great
west
while
prickly
porky
had
come
down
from
the
north
woods
prickly
porky
took
one
good
look
and
then
he
grunted
i
soon
fix
him
what
he
saw
was
some
one
who
looked
something
like
a
very
large
gray
fox
or
a
dog
and
prickly
porky
had
put
too
many
foxes
and
dogs
to
flight
to
feel
the
least
bit
of
fear
of
the
stranger
grinning
at
him
and
showing
all
his
great
teeth
but
old
man
coyote
did
know
what
to
make
of
what
he
saw
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
seen
anything
like
it
he
did
know
whether
to
laugh
or
to
be
frightened
about
all
he
could
see
was
what
looked
like
a
tremendous
great
on
legs
which
came
towards
him
in
little
rushes
and
with
a
great
rattling
of
the
thousand
little
spears
which
made
him
look
like
a
old
man
coyote
had
never
fought
with
anybody
like
this
and
he
did
know
just
how
to
begin
he
did
like
the
look
of
the
thousand
little
spears
the
nearer
they
came
the
less
he
liked
the
look
of
them
so
he
backed
away
a
few
steps
growling
and
snarling
angrily
now
it
seemed
that
as
if
by
magic
the
news
that
there
was
trouble
between
prickly
porky
and
old
man
coyote
had
spread
all
over
the
green
meadows
and
through
the
green
forest
everybody
who
dared
to
go
was
on
hand
to
see
it
sammy
jay
and
his
cousin
blacky
the
crow
were
there
of
course
peering
down
from
the
top
of
a
and
screaming
excitedly
happy
jack
the
gray
squirrel
and
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
actually
sat
side
by
side
in
the
same
tree
so
interested
that
they
forgot
for
once
to
quarrel
themselves
unc
billy
possum
and
bobby
coon
cut
their
afternoon
nap
short
and
looked
on
from
a
safe
place
in
a
big
danny
meadow
mouse
and
his
cousin
whitefoot
the
wood
mouse
shivered
with
fright
while
they
peeped
out
through
a
crack
in
a
hollow
log
johnny
chuck
came
as
near
as
he
dared
and
peeped
over
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
billy
mink
and
jerry
muskrat
quietly
swam
up
the
laughing
brook
and
crawled
out
on
the
farther
bank
where
they
could
see
and
still
be
safe
of
course
reddy
and
granny
fox
were
there
well
hidden
so
that
no
one
should
see
them
and
what
do
you
think
every
one
of
them
was
wishing
why
that
prickly
porky
would
drive
old
man
coyote
away
from
the
green
forest
and
off
of
the
green
meadows
you
see
every
one
of
them
was
afraid
of
old
man
coyote
and
right
down
in
his
heart
each
was
hoping
that
prickly
porky
would
be
able
to
send
old
man
coyote
off
yelping
with
his
face
stuck
full
of
little
spears
as
once
upon
a
time
he
had
sent
bowser
the
hound
xiv
slow
wit
and
quick
wit
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
and
old
man
coyote
the
prairie
wolf
met
beside
the
laughing
brook
it
was
a
case
of
slow
wit
meeting
quick
wit
you
see
prickly
porky
is
very
slow
in
everything
he
does
that
is
everything
but
flipping
that
queer
tail
of
his
about
when
there
is
an
enemy
near
enough
for
it
to
reach
but
in
everything
else
he
is
oh
so
slow
he
walks
as
if
he
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
to
get
to
the
place
he
has
started
for
he
climbs
in
just
the
same
way
and
because
he
never
moves
quickly
he
never
thinks
quickly
the
fact
is
he
see
any
need
of
hurrying
not
even
in
thinking
but
old
man
coyote
is
just
the
opposite
yes
sir
he
is
just
the
opposite
no
one
moves
quicker
than
he
does
he
is
nimble
on
his
feet
and
his
wit
is
just
as
quick
his
nimble
wit
and
nimble
feet
are
very
very
hard
to
beat
digger
the
badger
who
also
comes
from
the
great
west
says
that
to
beat
old
man
coyote
in
anything
you
should
start
the
day
before
he
does
and
not
let
him
know
it
so
here
was
slow
wit
facing
quick
wit
with
most
of
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folk
looking
on
suddenly
old
man
coyote
sprang
forward
with
his
ugliest
snarl
a
snarl
that
made
everybody
but
prickly
porky
shiver
even
those
who
were
perfectly
safe
up
in
the
trees
but
prickly
porky
did
shiver
no
sir
he
just
grunted
angrily
and
rattled
this
thousand
little
spears
now
old
man
coyote
had
sprung
with
that
ugly
snarl
just
to
try
to
frighten
prickly
porky
and
he
had
taken
care
not
to
spring
too
close
to
those
rattling
spears
when
he
found
that
prickly
porky
frightened
the
least
little
bit
he
tried
another
plan
perhaps
he
could
get
prickly
porky
from
behind
as
quick
as
a
flash
and
as
light
as
a
feather
he
leaped
right
over
prickly
porky
and
turned
to
seize
him
from
behind
but
he
did
oh
my
no
you
see
the
thousand
little
spears
covered
every
inch
of
prickly
porky
back
slowly
and
clumsily
prickly
porky
turned
so
as
to
face
his
enemy
got
fooled
that
time
did
you
smarty
he
grunted
while
his
eyes
snapped
with
anger
old
man
coyote
did
say
anything
he
just
grinned
but
all
the
time
he
was
using
his
eyes
and
now
he
discovered
that
while
prickly
porky
was
fully
protected
on
his
back
and
sides
by
the
thousand
little
spears
carried
in
his
coat
there
was
a
single
little
spear
in
his
waistcoat
i
got
to
get
him
where
i
can
seize
him
from
underneath
thought
he
and
straightway
he
began
to
run
in
a
circle
around
prickly
porky
while
the
latter
turned
slowly
round
and
round
trying
to
keep
his
face
turned
always
towards
old
man
coyote
faster
and
faster
ran
old
man
coyote
and
faster
and
faster
turned
prickly
porky
in
his
slow
mind
he
was
trying
to
understand
what
it
meant
but
he
could
and
for
a
while
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
looking
on
were
just
as
much
puzzled
it
was
a
most
surprising
thing
then
suddenly
unc
billy
possum
understood
he
trying
to
make
prickly
porky
dizzy
he
whispered
to
bobby
coon
let
warn
prickly
porky
he
never
think
of
it
himself
until
too
late
whispered
bobby
coon
but
before
they
could
do
this
the
queer
performance
came
to
an
end
prickly
porky
had
discovered
what
old
man
coyote
was
trying
to
do
but
he
had
become
tired
of
such
foolishness
and
he
suddenly
decided
to
take
a
rest
so
he
stopped
turning
around
and
then
curled
himself
up
in
a
ball
on
the
ground
where
he
looked
like
a
great
chestnut
burr
everybody
held
their
breath
to
see
what
old
man
coyote
would
do
next
xv
prickly
porky
tail
who
on
a
prickly
porcupine
makes
up
his
mind
that
he
will
dine
must
overcome
a
thousand
quills
before
his
stomach
porky
fills
and
so
it
is
with
you
and
me
with
everybody
whom
we
see
with
reddy
fox
and
billy
mink
and
all
the
rest
of
whom
we
think
on
meadows
green
in
smiling
pool
or
hidden
in
the
forest
cool
the
thing
we
set
our
hearts
upon
must
past
a
thousand
spears
be
won
one
knows
this
better
than
did
old
man
coyote
as
he
ran
around
and
around
prickly
porky
he
had
never
felt
one
of
those
little
spears
which
prickly
porky
rattled
so
fiercely
and
he
had
no
mind
to
feel
one
you
see
he
did
like
the
look
of
them
when
finally
prickly
porky
lay
down
and
curled
up
into
a
great
prickly
ball
like
a
huge
chestnut
burr
old
man
coyote
sat
down
just
a
little
way
off
to
study
how
he
was
going
to
get
at
prickly
porky
without
getting
hurt
by
some
of
those
sharp
barbed
little
spears
for
a
long
time
he
sat
and
studied
and
studied
his
tongue
hanging
out
of
one
side
of
his
mouth
once
he
looked
up
at
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
and
winked
but
he
did
make
a
sound
sammy
and
blacky
chuckled
to
themselves
and
winked
back
and
for
a
wonder
they
did
make
a
sound
somehow
that
wink
made
them
have
more
of
a
friendly
feeling
for
old
man
coyote
you
see
that
wink
told
them
that
old
man
coyote
was
just
the
same
kind
of
a
sly
rogue
as
themselves
and
so
right
away
they
had
a
fellow
feeling
for
him
and
none
of
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
looking
on
made
a
sound
some
of
them
did
dare
to
and
others
were
so
anxious
to
see
what
would
happen
next
that
they
did
want
to
it
was
so
still
that
the
little
leaves
up
in
the
could
be
heard
whispering
good
night
to
the
merry
little
breezes
for
whom
old
mother
west
wind
was
waiting
with
her
big
bag
out
on
the
green
meadows
to
take
them
to
their
home
behind
the
purple
hills
it
was
so
still
that
after
a
while
prickly
porky
began
to
wonder
if
he
were
all
alone
you
see
being
curled
up
that
way
he
could
see
and
had
to
trust
to
his
ears
he
waited
a
little
longer
and
then
he
uncurled
just
enough
to
peep
out
there
sat
old
man
coyote
and
prickly
porky
promptly
curled
up
again
now
the
minute
he
curled
up
again
something
happened
old
man
coyote
looked
up
at
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
and
winked
once
more
then
very
softly
so
softly
that
he
did
so
much
as
rustle
a
leaf
he
tiptoed
around
to
the
other
side
of
prickly
porky
and
sat
down
just
as
before
now
thought
he
when
he
peeps
out
again
he
will
think
i
have
gone
and
then
perhaps
i
can
catch
him
by
bobby
coon
saw
through
his
plan
right
away
some
one
ought
to
warn
prickly
porky
he
whispered
to
unc
billy
possum
unc
billy
shook
his
head
no
he
whispered
back
no
brer
coon
that
would
be
fair
it
quarrel
and
not
ours
and
though
ah
done
want
to
see
brer
porky
win
just
as
much
as
yo
do
ah
reckon
it
would
be
right
fo
us
to
meddle
done
got
to
fight
it
out
for
a
long
time
nothing
happened
then
old
man
coyote
grew
tired
of
waiting
very
carefully
he
crept
nearer
and
nearer
with
his
nose
stretched
out
to
sniff
at
that
prickly
ball
on
the
ground
everybody
held
his
breath
for
everybody
remembered
what
had
happened
to
bowser
the
hound
when
he
came
sniffing
around
prickly
porky
how
prickly
porky
tail
had
suddenly
slapped
bowser
full
in
the
face
filling
it
with
sharp
little
spears
now
they
hoped
to
see
the
same
thing
happen
to
old
man
coyote
so
they
held
their
breath
as
they
kept
their
eyes
on
old
man
coyote
and
prickly
porky
tail
xvi
old
man
coyote
smartness
when
you
meet
an
adversary
bold
and
brave
be
also
wary
if
the
weapons
you
may
hear
of
teeth
and
claws
you
have
no
fear
of
do
be
heedless
and
rush
blindly
lest
you
be
received
unkindly
and
like
prickly
porky
find
him
with
a
dangerous
tail
behind
him
old
man
coyote
knew
nothing
about
that
dangerous
tail
he
had
never
heard
how
bowser
the
hound
had
been
sent
yelping
home
with
his
face
stuck
full
of
those
sharp
little
spears
but
old
man
coyote
is
wary
oh
my
yes
he
certainly
is
wary
to
be
wary
you
know
is
to
be
very
very
careful
where
you
go
and
what
you
do
until
you
know
for
sure
that
there
is
no
possible
danger
and
there
is
no
one
more
wary
than
old
man
coyote
not
even
wise
sly
old
granny
fox
so
now
though
prickly
porky
curled
up
in
a
ball
in
front
of
him
looked
harmless
enough
except
for
the
thousand
little
spears
sticking
out
all
over
him
old
man
coyote
was
too
wary
too
smart
and
too
careful
to
take
any
chances
as
bowser
the
hound
had
rashly
done
and
this
is
why
as
he
stole
forward
with
his
nose
stretched
out
as
if
to
sniff
of
prickly
porky
he
suddenly
stopped
just
when
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
looking
on
were
holding
their
breath
and
hugging
themselves
with
joy
and
excitement
because
they
expected
to
see
the
same
thing
happen
to
old
man
coyote
that
had
happened
to
bowser
yes
sir
old
man
coyote
stopped
he
studied
prickly
porky
a
few
minutes
then
slowly
he
walked
around
him
just
studying
and
studying
illustration
it
looks
safe
enough
to
go
closer
and
sniff
at
him
thought
old
man
coyote
but
i
learned
a
long
time
ago
that
you
can
not
always
tell
just
by
looks
and
that
the
most
harmless
looking
thing
is
sometimes
the
most
dangerous
now
it
looks
to
me
as
if
this
stupid
porcupine
could
hurt
a
flee
so
long
as
he
keeps
curled
up
this
way
but
i
do
and
i
not
going
any
nearer
until
i
do
he
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
and
then
he
had
an
idea
he
began
to
dig
in
the
soft
earth
what
under
the
sun
is
he
doing
that
for
whispered
happy
jack
squirrel
to
his
cousin
chatterer
the
bed
squirrel
i
do
know
replied
chatterer
also
in
a
whisper
we
probably
know
in
a
few
he
had
hardly
finished
when
old
man
coyote
threw
a
little
lump
of
earth
so
that
it
hit
prickly
porky
now
of
course
prickly
porky
could
see
what
was
going
on
because
you
know
he
was
curled
up
with
his
head
tucked
down
in
his
waistcoat
but
he
had
been
listening
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
and
he
had
heard
old
man
coyote
footsteps
very
close
to
him
when
the
little
lump
of
earth
struck
him
he
thought
it
was
old
man
coyote
himself
and
like
a
flash
he
slapped
that
queer
tail
of
his
around
of
course
it
did
hit
anybody
because
there
was
nobody
within
reach
but
it
told
old
man
coyote
all
that
he
wanted
to
know
ha
ha
ha
he
laughed
that
the
time
i
fooled
you
instead
of
you
fooling
me
you
got
to
get
up
early
to
fool
me
with
a
trick
like
that
smarty
then
what
do
you
think
he
did
why
he
just
scooped
earth
on
to
prickly
porky
as
fast
as
he
could
dig
prickly
porky
stood
it
for
a
few
minutes
but
he
did
want
to
be
buried
alive
besides
now
that
his
trick
was
found
out
by
the
smartness
of
old
man
coyote
there
was
no
use
in
keeping
still
any
longer
so
with
a
grunt
of
anger
prickly
porky
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
rattling
his
thousand
little
spears
rushed
at
old
man
coyote
who
just
jumped
to
one
side
laughing
fit
to
kill
himself

granny
fox
is
found
out
granny
fox
is
sly
and
wise
and
seldom
taken
by
surprise
but
wisdom
wrongly
put
to
use
can
never
find
a
good
excuse
it
ceases
then
to
wisdom
be
but
foolishness
as
we
shall
see
with
all
her
smartness
and
all
her
cleverness
old
granny
fox
had
made
one
great
mistake
yes
sir
old
granny
fox
had
made
one
great
mistake
you
see
she
had
become
so
used
to
being
thought
the
smartest
and
cleverest
of
all
the
little
people
who
lived
on
the
green
meadows
and
around
the
smiling
pool
and
in
the
green
forest
that
she
had
come
to
believe
that
there
could
be
anybody
anywhere
as
smart
and
clever
as
she
that
was
because
she
did
know
old
man
coyote
and
now
as
she
and
reddy
fox
watched
from
their
hiding
place
the
meeting
between
old
man
coyote
and
prickly
porky
she
felt
a
sudden
sharp
sting
in
her
pride
old
man
coyote
had
proved
himself
too
smart
for
prickly
porky
she
ground
her
teeth
as
she
heard
him
laughing
fit
to
kill
himself
as
he
kept
out
of
prickly
porky
reach
and
she
ground
them
still
more
as
she
heard
him
say
you
will
boast
that
you
will
drive
me
out
of
the
green
forest
will
you
porcupine
the
time
to
brag
will
be
when
you
have
done
prickly
porky
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
one
of
his
clumsy
rushes
boaster
and
bragger
yourself
he
grunted
you
do
seem
to
be
dining
on
porcupine
the
first
time
we
meet
why
do
you
why
do
you
make
your
own
boast
good
old
man
coyote
stopped
laughing
and
pricked
up
his
ears
what
that
he
demanded
what
that
somebody
has
been
filling
your
ears
with
something
that
is
very
like
a
lie
no
more
than
they
have
yours
coyote
replied
prickly
porky
letting
his
thousand
little
spears
drop
part
way
back
into
his
coat
but
old
granny
fox
told
ha
so
it
was
granny
fox
interrupted
old
man
coyote
so
it
was
old
granny
fox
well
it
was
that
same
old
who
told
me
that
he
stopped
and
suddenly
looked
very
hard
at
the
very
place
where
granny
and
reddy
were
hiding
then
he
made
a
long
jump
in
that
direction
granny
and
reddy
did
wait
for
him
they
started
for
home
so
fast
that
they
looked
like
nothing
but
two
little
red
streaks
disappearing
among
the
trees
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
hee
hee
hee
ha
ho
he
ho
laughed
old
man
coyote
and
all
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
who
were
looking
on
laughed
with
him
then
he
turned
to
prickly
porky
illustration
i
guess
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
friends
said
he
i
guess
we
are
replied
prickly
porky
and
all
his
little
spears
dropped
out
of
sight
xviii
the
cunning
of
old
granny
fox
you
must
get
up
very
early
you
must
lie
awake
at
night
you
must
have
your
wits
well
sharpened
and
your
eyes
must
be
so
bright
that
there
nothing
can
escape
them
nothing
that
you
do
not
see
if
ahead
of
granny
fox
you
ever
get
or
hope
to
be
jack
squirrel
made
up
that
verse
one
day
after
he
had
had
oh
such
a
narrow
escape
from
old
granny
fox
it
had
made
happy
jack
very
sober
for
a
while
for
granny
had
so
nearly
caught
him
that
she
actually
had
pulled
some
hair
from
happy
jack
tail
all
the
other
little
forest
and
meadow
people
agreed
that
happy
jack
was
quite
right
most
of
them
had
had
just
such
narrow
escapes
from
old
granny
fox
you
see
it
is
this
way
old
granny
fox
is
very
very
cunning
to
be
cunning
you
know
is
to
be
sly
and
smart
in
doing
things
in
such
a
way
as
no
one
else
will
think
of
doing
them
just
now
the
thing
that
granny
wanted
most
of
anything
in
the
world
was
to
drive
old
man
coyote
away
from
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
she
could
do
it
openly
because
he
was
bigger
and
stronger
than
she
so
she
had
thought
and
thought
and
thought
trying
to
find
some
plan
which
might
get
old
man
coyote
into
trouble
so
that
he
would
go
away
and
stay
away
then
reddy
fox
told
her
that
he
had
found
the
place
where
old
man
coyote
took
a
every
day
and
a
splendid
plan
came
to
granny
at
least
it
seemed
like
a
splendid
plan
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
better
it
seemed
but
granny
fox
never
acts
hastily
she
is
too
wise
for
that
so
she
studied
and
studied
this
plan
that
she
had
thought
of
to
make
trouble
for
old
man
coyote
finally
she
was
satisfied
i
believe
it
will
work
i
certainly
do
believe
it
will
work
said
she
and
called
reddy
fox
over
to
her
i
want
you
to
make
sure
that
old
man
coyote
takes
his
in
the
same
place
every
day
said
she
you
must
see
him
there
yourself
it
wo
do
to
take
the
word
of
any
one
else
for
it
i
want
you
to
steal
up
every
day
and
make
sure
that
he
is
there
be
sure
you
do
tell
any
one
not
any
one
at
all
what
you
are
doing
and
above
all
things
let
get
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
reddy
promised
that
he
would
take
the
greatest
care
and
so
for
a
week
every
day
he
crept
to
a
snug
behind
a
thick
clump
of
grass
where
he
could
peep
through
and
see
old
man
coyote
taking
his
then
he
would
tiptoe
softly
away
and
hurry
to
report
to
old
granny
fox
good
she
would
say
go
again
and
make
sure
that
he
is
but
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
reddy
asked
one
day
for
he
was
becoming
very
very
curious
never
mind
what
i
want
to
know
for
replied
granny
severely
do
as
i
tell
you
and
you
will
find
out
soon
you
see
granny
fox
was
too
cunning
to
let
even
reddy
know
of
her
plan
for
if
no
one
but
herself
knew
it
it
could
possibly
leak
out
and
that
you
know
is
the
only
way
to
keep
a
secret
xix
bowser
the
hound
has
a
visitor
the
hound
lay
in
fanner
brown
dooryard
dozing
in
the
sun
bowser
was
dreaming
yes
sir
bowser
was
dreaming
farmer
brown
boy
passing
through
the
yard
on
his
way
to
the
cornfield
laughed
sic
him
bowser
sic
him
that
the
dog
do
let
him
fool
you
this
time
said
he
you
see
bowser
was
talking
in
his
sleep
he
was
whining
eagerly
and
every
once
in
a
while
breaking
out
into
excited
little
yelps
and
so
farmer
brown
boy
knew
that
he
was
dreaming
that
he
was
hunting
that
he
was
on
the
trail
of
reddy
fox
or
sly
old
granny
fox
his
eyes
were
shut
and
he
did
hear
what
fanner
brown
boy
said
the
latter
went
off
laughing
his
hoe
on
his
shoulder
for
there
was
work
for
him
down
in
the
cornfield
bowser
kept
right
on
getting
more
and
more
excited
it
was
a
splendid
hunt
he
was
having
there
in
dreamland
across
the
green
meadows
along
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
and
up
through
the
old
pasture
he
ran
all
in
his
dream
you
know
and
just
ahead
of
him
ran
old
granny
fox
not
once
was
he
fooled
by
her
tricks
and
she
tried
every
one
she
knew
for
once
he
was
too
smart
for
her
and
it
made
him
tingle
all
over
with
delight
for
he
was
sure
that
this
time
he
would
catch
her
and
then
something
queer
happened
yes
sir
it
was
something
very
queer
indeed
he
saw
granny
fox
stop
just
a
little
way
ahead
of
him
she
sat
down
facing
him
and
began
to
laugh
at
him
she
laughed
and
laughed
fit
to
kill
herself
it
made
bowser
very
angry
oh
very
angry
indeed
no
one
likes
to
be
laughed
at
you
know
and
to
be
laughed
at
by
granny
fox
of
all
people
was
more
than
bowser
could
stand
he
opened
his
mouth
to
give
a
great
roar
as
he
sprang
at
her
and
then
why
bowser
waked
up
yes
sir
he
really
had
given
a
great
roar
and
had
waked
himself
up
with
his
own
voice
for
a
few
minutes
bowser
winked
and
blinked
for
the
sun
was
shining
in
his
eyes
then
he
winked
and
blinked
some
more
but
not
because
of
the
sun
oh
my
no
it
was
because
of
the
sun
that
he
winked
and
blinked
now
it
was
because
what
do
you
think
why
it
was
because
bowser
the
hound
could
tell
whether
he
was
awake
or
asleep
he
thought
that
he
was
awake
he
was
sure
that
he
was
awake
and
yet
well
there
sat
old
granny
fox
laughing
at
him
just
as
he
had
seen
her
in
his
dream
yes
sir
there
she
sat
laughing
at
him
poor
bowser
he
just
did
know
what
to
think
he
rubbed
both
eyes
and
looked
there
she
sat
laughing
just
as
before
bowser
closed
his
eyes
tight
and
kept
them
closed
for
a
whole
minute
perhaps
when
he
opened
them
again
she
would
be
gone
then
he
would
know
that
she
was
only
a
dream
fox
after
all
but
no
sir
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
there
she
sat
laughing
harder
than
ever
just
then
a
hen
came
around
a
corner
of
the
house
granny
fox
stopped
laughing
like
a
flash
she
caught
the
hen
slung
her
over
her
shoulder
and
trotted
away
all
the
time
keeping
one
eye
on
bowser
then
bowser
knew
that
this
was
no
dream
fox
but
old
granny
fox
herself
and
that
she
had
had
the
impudence
and
boldness
to
steal
a
hen
right
under
his
very
nose
he
was
awake
now
was
bowser
very
much
awake
with
a
great
roar
of
anger
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
started
after
granny
and
startled
the
merry
little
breezes
at
play
on
the
green
meadows
xx
the
clever
plan
of
granny
fox
bold
visit
of
old
granny
fox
to
bowser
the
hound
in
farmer
dooryard
right
in
broad
daylight
was
all
a
part
of
the
clever
plan
granny
had
worked
out
to
make
trouble
for
old
man
coyote
first
she
had
sent
reddy
fox
to
make
sure
that
old
man
coyote
was
taking
his
usual
in
his
usual
place
if
he
were
reddy
was
to
softly
steal
away
and
then
hurry
to
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
where
it
comes
down
the
hill
when
he
got
there
he
was
to
bark
three
times
granny
was
to
be
hidden
behind
the
old
stone
wall
on
the
edge
of
farmer
orchard
and
when
she
heard
reddy
bark
she
was
to
do
her
part
while
reddy
was
to
hide
in
a
secret
place
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
and
watch
what
would
happen
it
all
turned
out
just
as
granny
had
planned
she
had
been
in
hiding
behind
the
old
stone
wall
only
a
few
minutes
when
she
heard
reddy
bark
three
times
granny
grinned
then
she
stole
up
to
farmer
dooryard
and
there
she
found
bowser
the
hound
fast
asleep
and
dreaming
she
was
just
getting
ready
to
bark
to
waken
him
when
he
waked
himself
with
his
own
voice
it
was
just
then
that
a
hen
happened
to
walk
around
the
corner
of
the
house
granny
eyes
sparkled
good
said
she
to
herself
i
take
this
hen
along
with
me
and
reddy
and
i
will
have
a
good
dinner
after
i
have
set
bowser
to
chasing
old
man
coyote
for
that
was
what
granny
was
planning
to
do
so
she
caught
the
hen
threw
it
over
her
shoulder
and
started
off
with
bowser
the
hound
after
her
making
a
great
noise
with
his
big
voice
now
of
course
granny
knew
that
she
could
carry
that
hen
very
far
and
keep
ahead
of
bowser
so
she
ran
straight
across
the
old
orchard
towards
the
secret
place
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
where
she
knew
that
reddy
fox
was
hiding
when
she
was
sure
that
reddy
could
see
her
she
gave
the
hen
a
toss
over
into
the
grass
and
then
raced
away
towards
the
green
meadows
you
see
she
knew
that
bowser
would
keep
on
right
after
her
and
when
it
was
safe
for
him
to
do
so
reddy
would
steal
out
from
his
hiding
place
and
get
the
hen
and
that
is
just
what
did
happen
away
ran
granny
and
after
her
ran
bowser
and
all
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
heard
his
great
voice
and
were
glad
that
he
was
not
after
them
but
granny
fox
was
not
worried
you
see
she
had
fooled
him
so
many
times
that
she
knew
she
could
do
it
again
so
she
kept
just
a
little
way
ahead
of
him
and
gradually
led
him
towards
the
place
where
old
man
coyote
took
his
every
day
but
she
was
too
smart
to
run
straight
towards
it
for
said
she
to
herself
if
i
do
that
he
will
become
alarmed
and
run
away
before
bowser
is
near
enough
to
see
so
she
ran
in
a
big
circle
around
the
place
feeling
sure
that
old
man
coyote
would
lie
perfectly
still
so
as
not
to
be
seen
round
and
round
ran
granny
fox
with
bowser
after
her
and
all
the
time
she
was
making
the
circles
smaller
and
smaller
so
as
to
get
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
of
old
man
coyote
when
she
thought
that
she
was
near
enough
she
suddenly
started
straight
for
it
now
thought
she
he
jump
and
run
and
when
bowser
sees
him
he
will
forget
all
about
me
he
will
follow
old
man
coyote
and
perhaps
he
will
drive
him
away
from
the
green
meadows
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
napping
place
granny
drew
she
was
almost
there
why
did
old
man
coyote
jump
and
run
at
last
she
was
right
to
it
she
could
see
just
where
he
had
been
stretched
out
but
he
there
now
there
was
a
sign
of
him
anywhere
what
did
it
mean
just
then
she
heard
a
sound
over
in
the
green
forest
that
made
her
grind
her
teeth
with
rage
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
hee
hee
nee
ha
ho
hee
ho
it
was
the
laughter
of
old
man
coyote
xxi
how
peter
rabbit
helped
old
man
coyote
a
kindly
word
a
kindly
deed
is
like
the
planting
of
a
seed
it
first
sends
forth
a
little
root
and
by
and
by
bears
splendid
fruit
old
man
coyote
first
came
to
the
green
meadows
to
live
he
chased
peter
rabbit
and
gave
peter
a
terrible
fright
after
that
for
some
time
peter
kept
very
close
to
the
dear
old
where
he
always
felt
perfectly
safe
but
peter
dearly
loves
to
roam
and
peter
is
very
very
curious
so
it
was
long
before
he
began
to
grow
tired
of
the
old
and
long
to
go
abroad
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
as
he
always
had
done
and
find
out
all
that
was
going
on
among
his
neighbors
of
course
peter
heard
a
great
deal
for
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
would
stop
almost
every
day
to
tell
him
the
latest
news
about
old
man
coyote
they
told
him
all
about
how
granny
fox
had
tried
to
make
trouble
between
him
and
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
and
how
she
had
been
found
out
after
they
had
gone
peter
sat
very
still
for
a
long
time
thinking
it
all
over
said
peter
to
himself
it
is
very
plain
to
me
that
old
man
coyote
is
smarter
than
granny
fox
and
that
means
a
great
deal
to
me
y
es
sir
that
means
a
great
deal
to
me
it
means
that
i
have
got
to
watch
out
for
him
even
sharper
than
i
have
to
watch
out
for
granny
and
reddy
fox
dear
me
dear
me
just
as
if
i
did
have
troubles
enough
as
it
is
as
he
talked
peter
was
sitting
on
the
very
edge
of
the
old
looking
towards
the
place
where
sammy
jay
had
told
him
that
old
man
coyote
took
his
every
day
suddenly
he
saw
something
that
made
him
stop
thinking
about
his
troubles
and
sit
up
a
little
straighter
and
open
his
big
eyes
a
little
wider
it
was
reddy
fox
creeping
very
very
slowly
and
carefully
towards
the
napping
place
of
old
man
coyote
when
he
was
near
enough
to
see
reddy
lay
down
in
the
grass
and
watched
after
a
little
while
he
tiptoed
back
to
the
green
forest
peter
scratched
his
long
left
ear
with
his
long
right
hind
foot
now
what
did
reddy
fox
do
that
for
he
said
thoughtfully
the
next
day
and
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
peter
saw
reddy
fox
do
the
same
thing
and
all
the
time
peter
curiosity
grew
and
grew
and
grew
he
did
say
anything
about
it
to
any
one
but
just
puzzled
and
puzzled
over
it
late
that
afternoon
peter
beard
footsteps
just
outside
the
old
peeping
out
he
saw
old
man
coyote
passing
curiosity
could
be
kept
down
no
longer
how
do
you
do
coyote
said
peter
in
a
very
small
and
frightened
sounding
voice
but
in
a
very
polite
manner
old
man
coyote
stopped
and
peeped
through
the
brambles
hello
peter
rabbit
said
he
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
outside
of
the
old
for
some
he
grinned
when
he
said
this
in
a
way
that
showed
all
his
long
sharp
teeth
no
replied
peter
i
i
well
you
see
i
afraid
of
old
granny
and
reddy
old
man
coyote
grinned
again
for
he
knew
that
it
was
himself
peter
really
feared
pooh
peter
rabbit
you
should
be
afraid
of
them
said
he
they
not
very
smart
you
ought
to
be
able
to
keep
out
of
their
peter
hopped
a
little
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
old
tell
me
coyote
what
is
reddy
fox
watching
you
for
every
day
when
you
take
your
what
that
demanded
old
man
coyote
sharply
he
listened
gravely
while
peter
told
him
what
he
had
seen
when
peter
had
finished
coyote
smiled
and
somehow
this
time
he
did
show
all
those
dreadful
teeth
thank
you
peter
rabbit
said
he
you
have
done
me
a
great
favor
and
i
hope
i
can
return
it
some
time
do
you
know
i
believe
that
we
are
going
to
be
and
with
that
old
man
coyote
went
on
his
way
chuckling
to
himself
xxii
why
the
clever
plan
of
granny
fox
failed
old
man
coyote
chuckling
to
himself
left
peter
rabbit
and
the
old
he
went
straight
over
to
look
around
the
place
where
he
took
his
every
day
his
sharp
eyes
soon
saw
the
place
where
reddy
fox
had
been
lying
in
the
grass
to
watch
him
for
of
course
the
grass
was
pressed
down
by
the
weight
of
reddy
body
peter
rabbit
told
me
the
truth
sure
enough
and
i
guess
i
owe
him
a
good
turn
muttered
old
man
coyote
as
he
studied
and
studied
to
see
why
reddy
was
watching
him
every
day
you
see
he
is
so
sharp
and
clever
himself
that
he
was
sure
right
away
that
reddy
had
some
plan
in
mind
to
bring
him
to
the
same
place
every
day
but
he
did
let
on
that
he
knew
anything
about
what
was
going
on
oh
my
no
the
next
day
he
curled
up
for
his
just
as
usual
only
this
time
he
took
care
to
lie
in
such
a
way
that
he
would
be
looking
towards
reddy
hiding
place
then
he
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
but
if
you
had
been
there
and
looked
into
his
eyes
you
would
have
found
no
there
no
sir
you
would
have
found
one
single
instead
his
eyes
were
as
bright
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
sleep
he
saw
reddy
steal
out
of
the
green
forest
then
he
closed
his
eyes
all
but
just
a
tiny
little
crack
through
which
he
could
see
reddy
hiding
place
but
all
the
time
he
looked
as
if
his
eyes
were
shut
tight
reddy
crept
softly
as
he
could
which
is
very
softly
indeed
to
his
hiding
place
and
lay
down
to
watch
old
man
coyote
pretended
to
be
very
fast
asleep
and
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
make
believe
snore
but
all
the
time
he
was
watching
reddy
after
a
little
while
reddy
tiptoed
away
until
he
felt
sure
that
it
was
safe
to
run
then
he
hurried
as
fast
as
he
could
go
to
report
to
old
granny
fox
in
the
green
forest
old
man
coyote
chuckled
as
he
watched
reddy
disappear
i
do
know
what
it
all
means
said
he
but
if
he
and
old
granny
fox
think
that
they
are
going
to
catch
me
napping
they
are
making
one
of
the
biggest
mistakes
of
their
the
next
day
and
the
next
the
same
thing
happened
but
the
day
after
that
reddy
only
stopped
long
enough
to
make
sure
that
old
man
coyote
was
there
just
as
usual
and
then
he
hurried
away
to
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
that
comes
down
the
hill
there
he
barked
three
times
old
man
coyote
watched
him
go
and
heard
him
bark
that
some
kind
of
a
signal
said
he
to
himself
and
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
it
means
mischief
i
think
i
wo
take
a
nap
for
i
want
to
see
what
is
going
with
that
old
man
coyote
made
a
very
long
leap
off
to
one
side
then
two
more
so
as
to
leave
no
scent
to
show
which
way
he
had
gone
then
chuckling
to
himself
he
hurried
to
the
green
forest
and
hid
where
he
could
watch
reddy
fox
he
saw
reddy
hide
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
where
he
could
watch
farmer
brown
dooryard
and
then
he
crept
up
where
he
could
watch
too
of
course
he
saw
old
granny
fox
when
she
led
bowser
the
hound
down
across
the
green
meadows
and
he
guessed
right
away
what
her
plan
was
it
tickled
him
so
that
he
had
to
clap
both
hands
over
his
mouth
as
he
watched
sly
old
granny
take
bowser
straight
over
to
his
and
when
he
saw
how
surprised
she
was
to
find
him
gone
he
sat
up
and
laughed
until
all
the
little
people
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
heard
him
and
wondered
what
could
be
tickling
old
man
coyote
so
xxiii
old
man
coyote
gets
a
good
dinner
old
granny
fox
found
that
old
man
coyote
was
not
at
his
usual
she
was
sure
that
reddy
fox
must
have
been
very
stupid
and
thought
that
he
saw
him
there
when
he
did
she
hurried
to
the
laughing
brook
and
waded
in
it
for
a
little
way
in
order
to
destroy
her
scent
so
that
bowser
the
hound
would
not
know
in
which
direction
she
had
gone
you
know
water
is
always
the
friend
of
little
animals
who
leave
scent
in
their
footsteps
bowser
came
baying
up
to
the
edge
of
the
laughing
brook
and
there
he
stopped
for
his
wonderful
nose
could
not
follow
granny
in
the
water
and
he
could
not
tell
whether
she
had
gone
up
or
down
or
across
the
brook
but
bowser
is
not
one
to
give
up
easily
no
indeed
he
had
learned
many
of
granny
tricks
and
now
he
knew
well
enough
what
granny
had
done
at
least
bowser
thought
that
he
knew
she
wade
a
little
way
and
then
she
will
come
out
of
the
water
so
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
find
the
place
where
she
has
come
out
and
there
i
will
find
her
tracks
again
said
he
and
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
he
hurried
down
one
bank
of
the
laughing
brook
he
went
as
far
as
he
thought
granny
could
have
waded
but
there
was
no
trace
of
her
then
he
crossed
the
brook
and
with
his
nose
still
to
the
ground
ran
back
to
the
starting
place
along
the
other
bank
she
did
go
down
the
brook
so
she
must
have
gone
up
said
bowser
and
started
up
the
brook
as
eagerly
as
he
had
gone
down
after
running
as
far
as
he
thought
granny
could
possibly
have
waded
bowser
crossed
over
and
ran
back
along
the
other
bank
to
the
starting
place
without
finding
any
trace
of
granny
fox
at
last
with
a
foolish
and
ashamed
air
bowser
gave
it
up
and
started
for
home
and
all
the
time
granny
fox
was
lying
in
plain
sight
watching
him
yes
sir
she
was
watching
him
and
laughing
to
herself
you
see
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
bowser
depends
more
on
his
nose
than
on
his
eyes
and
that
when
he
is
running
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
he
can
see
very
little
about
him
so
she
had
simply
waded
down
the
laughing
brook
to
a
flat
rock
in
the
middle
of
it
and
on
this
she
had
stretched
herself
out
and
kept
perfectly
still
twice
bowser
had
gone
right
past
without
seeing
her
she
enjoyed
seeing
him
fooled
so
much
that
for
the
time
being
she
quite
forgot
about
old
man
coyote
and
the
failure
of
her
clever
plan
to
make
trouble
for
him
but
when
bowser
the
hound
had
gone
granny
remembered
she
stopped
laughing
and
a
look
of
angry
disappointment
crossed
her
face
as
she
trotted
towards
home
but
as
she
trotted
along
her
face
cleared
a
little
any
way
reddy
and
i
will
have
a
good
dinner
on
that
fat
hen
i
caught
in
farmer
brown
dooryard
she
muttered
when
she
reached
home
there
sat
reddy
on
the
doorstep
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
fat
hen
and
reddy
looked
very
uneasy
and
frightened
where
that
fat
hen
i
caught
demanded
granny
crossly
i
i
i
sorry
granny
but
i
have
got
it
said
reddy
have
got
it
snapped
granny
what
the
matter
with
you
reddy
fox
did
you
see
me
throw
it
in
the
grass
when
i
ran
past
the
place
where
you
were
hiding
and
did
you
know
enough
to
go
and
get
it
yes
replied
reddy
i
saw
you
throw
it
in
the
grass
and
i
went
out
and
got
it
but
on
my
way
home
i
met
some
one
who
took
it
away
from
took
it
away
from
you
exclaimed
granny
who
was
it
tell
me
this
instant
who
was
it
old
man
coyote
replied
reddy
in
a
low
frightened
voice
old
granny
fox
simply
stared
at
reddy
she
could
find
a
word
to
say
instead
of
making
trouble
for
old
man
coyote
she
had
furnished
him
with
a
good
dinner
he
was
smarter
than
she
she
decided
then
and
there
that
she
could
not
drive
old
man
coyote
out
of
the
green
forest
and
that
she
would
either
have
to
leave
herself
or
accept
him
and
make
the
best
of
it
but
that
what
old
man
coyote
had
thought
all
along
for
he
quite
liked
his
new
home
and
took
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
his
new
neighbors
one
of
these
whom
he
found
most
interesting
was
paddy
the
beaver
paddy
really
is
a
very
wonderful
fellow
and
i
will
tell
you
about
him
in
the
next
book
the
end
