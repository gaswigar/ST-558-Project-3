the

foreword
the
book
here
offered
in
english
to
the
public
has
long
been
known
and
admired
by
students
as
the
first
and
perhaps
the
most
notable
example
of
modern
belgian
literature
its
author
was
born
of
obscure
parentage
in
and
after
a
life
passed
in
not
much
less
obscurity
died
in
the
ten
years
which
were
devoted
to
the
composition
of
the
legend
of
tyl
ulenspiegel
were
devoted
to
what
proved
for
de
coster
little
more
than
a
labour
of
love
recognition
came
to
him
but
from
the
few
and
it
was
not
till
some
thirty
years
after
his
death
that
an
official
monument
was
raised
at
brussels
to
his
memory
and
an
official
oration
delivered
in
his
praise
by
camille
lemonnier
to
the
undiscerning
among
his
contemporaries
de
coster
may
have
appeared
little
else
than
a
rather
eccentric
journalist
with
archæological
tastes
for
a
time
indeed
he
held
a
post
on
the
royal
commission
which
was
appointed
in
to
investigate
and
publish
old
flemish
laws
and
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
became
a
professor
of
history
and
french
literature
at
the
military
school
in
brussels
never
certainly
has
a
work
of
imagination
planned
on
an
epic
scale
been
composed
with
a
closer
regard
for
historical
detail
than
this
legend
but
if
our
present
age
is
less
likely
to
be
held
by
this
than
by
those
other
qualities
in
the
book
of
vitality
and
passion
it
can
only
be
that
de
coster
poured
into
his
work
not
merely
the
knowledge
and
accuracy
of
an
historian
but
the
love
as
well
and
the
ardour
of
a
poet
and
a
patriot
the
objection
if
it
be
an
objection
that
de
coster
borrowed
unblushingly
from
his
predecessors
need
never
be
disputed
his
style
is
frankly
rabelaisian
the
stage
whereon
his
actors
play
their
parts
is
set
scene
almost
for
scene
from
the
generally
available
documents
that
served
such
a
writer
as
thomas
motley
for
his
history
of
the
rise
of
the
dutch
republic
even
the
name
the
very
lineaments
of
ulenspiegel
are
borrowed
from
that
familiar
figure
of
the
whose
jolly
pranks
and
schoolboy
frolics
have
been
crystallized
in
the
french
word
espièglerie
and
in
our
own
day
set
to
music
in
one
of
the
symphonic
poems
of
richard
strauss
yet
from
such
ingredients
de
coster
genius
has
mixed
a
potion
most
individually
his
own
the
style
of
rabelais
is
tempered
with
a
finish
a
neatness
and
a
wit
that
are
as
truly
the
product
of
the
modern
spirit
as
was
the
flamboyant
jollity
of
rabelais
the
product
of
his
own
renaissance
age
the
sensible
historical
foreground
of
a
motley
becomes
the
coloured
background
to
a
romantic
drama
of
human
vice
and
virtue
linked
in
its
turn
to
a
conception
of
the
cosmic
process
which
has
no
other
home
surely
than
in
the
author
brain
while
ulenspiegel
himself
is
now
not
simply
the
type
of
young
high
spirits
and
animal
good
humour
but
a
being
as
complex
as
almost
as
humanity
all
brightness
of
intellect
all
warmth
of
heart
all
honour
and
all
dream
the
immortal
spirit
of
flanders
that
knows
not
what
it
is
to
be
beaten
whose
last
song
must
for
ever
remain
unsung
what
shall
we
say
of
those
other
homely
personages
who
fill
the
scene
symbols
no
less
of
flemish
character
at
its
finest
and
of
the
enduringly
domestic
springs
of
flemish
national
life
claes
the
trusty
fatherhood
soetkin
the
valiant
motherhood
of
flanders
nele
her
true
heart
lamme
goedzak
her
great
belly
that
hungers
always
for
more
and
yet
more
good
things
to
eat
and
is
never
satisfied
or
what
again
of
the
tragic
katheline
half
witch
half
martyr
and
the
centre
of
that
dark
intrigue
which
seems
to
throb
like
a
shuttle
through
the
mazy
pattern
of
the
plot
threading
it
all
into
unity
from
yet
another
standpoint
as
an
envisagement
of
the
horrors
of
the
spanish
inquisition
de
coster
work
is
probably
without
parallel
in
an
already
field
the
sinister
figure
of
the
king
of
spain
broods
over
it
all
like
a
kaiser
and
the
episodes
of
stake
and
torture
are
recorded
with
a
realism
which
might
appear
exaggerated
had
not
modern
belgium
though
in
terms
of
scientific
warfare
an
even
more
devilish
tale
to
tell
the
fact
is
that
de
coster
trick
of
stating
horror
and
leaving
it
to
make
its
full
effect
without
a
touch
of
the
rhetoric
of
indignation
proves
the
deadliest
of
all
corrosive
weapons
and
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
the
book
had
been
hailed
in
some
quarters
as
a
protestant
tract
but
de
coster
himself
was
in
no
sense
a
theological
partisan
and
his
sympathy
with
the
beggarmen
sprang
from
his
enthusiasm
for
national
liberty
far
more
than
from
any
bias
towards
the
protestant
cause
as
such
that
catholicism
has
ever
been
identified
with
tyranny
the
best
catholic
will
most
deplore
nor
will
de
coster
traditional
irreverence
blind
such
a
eyes
to
the
spiritual
generosity
which
permeates
the
whole
work
and
is
indeed
its
most
essential
characteristic
it
remains
to
add
that
in
the
interests
of
publishing
the
present
version
represents
a
curtailment
of
the
legend
as
it
left
the
author
hands
here
and
there
also
to
maintain
the
continuity
of
incident
the
translator
has
permitted
himself
some
slight
modification
of
the
original
text
by
this
means
it
is
hoped
that
the
proportions
of
the
whole
have
been
fairly
maintained
and
that
no
vital
aspect
of
plot
or
atmosphere
has
been
altogether
suppressed
or
allowed
an
undue
prominence
here
begins
the
first
book
of
the
legend
of
the
glorious
joyous
and
heroic
adventures
of
tyl
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
goedzak
in
the
land
of
flanders
and
elsewhere
i
at
damme
in
flanders
when
the
may
hawthorn
was
coming
into
flower
ulenspiegel
was
born
the
son
of
claes
when
she
had
wrapped
him
in
warm
katheline
the
midwife
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
infant
head
and
found
a
piece
of
skin
hanging
therefrom
born
with
a
caul
she
cried
out
joyfully
born
under
a
lucky
star
but
a
moment
later
noticing
a
small
black
mole
on
the
shoulder
she
fell
into
lamentation
alas
she
wept
it
is
the
black
of
the
devil
monsieur
satan
said
claes
must
have
risen
early
this
morning
if
already
he
has
found
time
to
set
his
sign
upon
my
son
be
sure
he
never
went
to
bed
answered
katheline
here
is
chanticleer
only
just
awakening
the
hens
and
so
saying
she
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
baby
in
the
arms
of
claes
then
it
was
that
the
dawn
came
bursting
through
the
clouds
of
night
and
the
swallows
skimmed
chirruping
over
the
fields
while
the
sun
began
to
show
his
dazzling
face
on
the
horizon
claes
opened
the
window
and
thus
addressed
himself
to
ulenspiegel
o
babe
born
with
a
caul
behold
here
is
my
lord
the
sun
who
comes
to
make
his
salutation
to
the
land
of
flanders
gaze
on
him
whenever
you
can
and
if
ever
in
after
years
you
come
to
be
in
any
doubt
or
difficulty
not
knowing
what
is
right
to
do
ask
counsel
of
him
he
is
bright
and
he
is
warm
be
sincere
as
that
brightness
and
virtuous
as
that
warmth
claes
my
good
man
said
soetkin
you
are
preaching
to
the
deaf
come
drink
son
of
mine
and
so
saying
the
mother
offered
to
her
babe
a
draught
from
nature

ii
while
ulenspiegel
nestled
close
and
drank
his
fill
all
the
birds
in
the
began
to
waken
claes
who
was
tying
up
sticks
regarded
his
wife
as
she
gave
the
breast
to
ulenspiegel
wife
he
said
hast
made
good
provision
of
this
fine
milk
the
pitchers
are
full
she
said
but
that
doth
not
suffice
for
my
peace
of
mind
it
seems
that
you
are
downhearted
over
your
good
fortune
said
claes
i
was
thinking
she
said
that
there
is
not
so
much
as
a
penny
piece
in
that
leather
bag
of
ours
hanging
on
the
wall
claes
took
hold
of
the
bag
and
shook
it
but
in
vain
there
was
no
sign
of
any
money
he
looked
crestfallen
nevertheless
hoping
to
comfort
his
good
wife
what
are
you
worrying
about
says
he
have
we
not
in
the
bin
that
cake
we
offered
katheline
yesterday
and
do
i
see
a
great
piece
of
meat
over
there
that
should
make
good
milk
for
the
child
for
three
days
at
the
least
and
this
tub
of
butter
is
it
a
and
are
they
spectres
those
apples
ranged
like
flags
and
banners
all
in
battle
order
row
after
row
in
the
storeroom
and
is
there
no
promise
of
cool
refreshment
guarded
safe
in
the
paunch
of
our
fine
old
cask
of
cuyte
de
bruges
soetkin
said
when
we
take
the
child
to
be
christened
we
shall
have
to
give
two
patards
to
the
priest
and
a
florin
for
the
feasting
but
at
this
moment
katheline
returned
with
a
great
bundle
of
herbs
in
her
arms
for
the
child
that
is
born
with
a
caul
she
cried
angelica
that
keeps
men
from
luxury
fenel
that
preserves
them
from
satan
have
you
none
of
that
herb
asked
claes
which
is
called
florins
no
said
she
very
well
he
answered
i
shall
go
and
see
if
i
can
not
find
any
growing
in
the
canal
and
with
that
he
went
off
with
his
line
and
his
knowing
that
he
would
not
be
likely
to
meet
any
one
since
it
was
yet
an
hour
before
the
oosterzon
which
is
in
the
land
of
flanders
six
in
the
morning
iii
claes
came
to
the
bruges
canal
not
far
from
the
sea
there
having
baited
his
hook
he
cast
it
into
the
water
and
let
out
the
line
on
the
opposite
bank
a
little
boy
was
lying
against
a
clump
of
earth
fast
asleep
the
boy
who
was
not
dressed
like
a
peasant
woke
up
at
the
noise
that
claes
was
making
and
began
to
run
away
fearing
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
village
constable
come
to
dislodge
him
from
his
bed
and
to
hale
him
off
as
a
vagabond
to
the
steen
but
he
soon
lost
his
fear
when
he
recognized
claes
and
when
claes
called
out
to
him
would
you
like
to
earn
a
penny
my
boy
well
then
drive
the
fish
over
to
my
side
at
this
proposal
the
little
boy
who
was
somewhat
stout
for
his
years
jumped
into
the
water
and
arming
himself
with
a
plume
of
long
reeds
he
began
to
drive
the
fish
towards
claes
when
the
fishing
was
over
claes
drew
up
his
line
and
his
and
came
over
by
the
lock
gate
towards
where
the
youngster
was
standing
your
name
said
claes
is
lamme
by
baptism
and
goedzak
by
nature
because
you
are
of
a
gentle
disposition
and
you
dwell
in
the
rue
héron
behind
the
church
of
our
lady
but
tell
me
why
it
is
that
young
as
you
are
and
well
dressed
you
are
yet
obliged
to
sleep
out
here
in
the
open
woe
is
me
answered
the
boy
i
have
a
sister
at
home
a
year
younger
than
i
am
who
fairly
thrashes
me
at
the
least
occasion
of
disagreement
but
i
dare
not
take
my
revenge
upon
her
back
for
fear
of
doing
her
some
injury
sir
last
night
at
supper
i
was
very
hungry
and
i
was
clearing
out
with
my
fingers
the
bottom
of
a
dish
of
beef
and
beans
she
wanted
to
share
it
but
there
was
not
enough
for
us
both
sir
and
when
she
saw
me
licking
my
lips
because
the
sauce
smelt
good
she
went
mad
with
rage
and
smote
me
with
all
her
force
so
hard
indeed
that
i
fled
away
from
the
house
beaten
all
black
and
blue
claes
asked
him
what
his
father
and
mother
were
doing
during
this
scene
my
father
hit
me
on
one
shoulder
and
my
mother
on
the
other
crying
back
at
her
you
coward
but
i
not
wishing
to
strike
a
girl
made
my
escape
all
at
once
lamme
went
pale
all
over
and
began
to
tremble
in
every
limb
and
claes
saw
a
tall
woman
approaching
and
by
her
side
a
young
girl
very
thin
and
fierce
of
aspect
oh
oh
cried
lamme
holding
on
to
claes
by
his
breeches
here
are
my
mother
and
my
sister
come
to
find
me
protect
me
please
mr
wait
said
claes
first
of
all
let
me
give
you
this
as
your
wages
and
now
let
us
go
and
meet
them
without
fear
when
the
two
women
saw
lamme
they
ran
up
and
both
began
to
belabour
him
the
mother
because
of
the
fright
he
had
given
her
the
sister
because
it
was
her
habit
so
to
do
lamme
took
refuge
behind
claes
and
cried
out
i
have
earned
a
i
have
earned
a
do
not
beat
me
by
this
time
however
his
mother
had
begun
to
embrace
him
while
the
girl
was
trying
to
force
open
his
hands
and
to
get
at
the
money
but
lamme
shouted
the
money
belongs
to
me
you
shall
not
have
it
and
he
kept
his
fingers
tightly
closed
but
claes
shook
the
girl
roughly
by
the
ears
and
said
to
her
if
you
go
on
picking
quarrels
like
this
with
your
brother
he
that
is
as
good
and
gentle
as
a
lamb
i
shall
put
you
in
a
black
and
then
it
wo
be
i
any
longer
that
will
be
shaking
you
by
the
ears
but
the
red
devil
himself
from
hell
and
he
will
pull
you
into
pieces
with
his
great
claws
and
his
teeth
that
are
like
forks
at
these
words
the
girl
averted
her
eyes
from
claes
nor
did
she
go
near
lamme
but
hid
behind
her
mother
skirts
and
when
she
got
back
into
the
town
she
went
about
crying
everywhere
the
has
beaten
me
and
he
keeps
the
devil
in
his
cave
nevertheless
she
did
not
attack
lamme
any
more
but
being
the
bigger
of
the
two
she
made
him
work
in
her
place
and
the
gentle
simpleton
obeyed
her
right
willingly
now
claes
on
his
way
home
sold
his
catch
to
a
farmer
that
often
used
to
buy
fish
from
him
and
when
he
was
home
again
he
said
to
soetkin
behold
here
what
i
have
found
in
the
bellies
of
four
pike
nine
carp
and
a
basketful
of
eels
and
he
threw
on
the
table
a
couple
of
florins
and
half
a
farthing
why
do
you
go
fishing
every
day
my
man
asked
soetkin
for
fear
of
becoming
a
fish
myself
and
being
caught
on
the
hook
of
the
village
constable
he
told
her
iv
claes
the
father
of
ulenspiegel
was
known
in
damme
by
the
name
of
kooldraeger
that
is
to
say
the
claes
had
a
black
head
of
hair
bright
eyes
and
a
skin
the
colour
of
his
own
merchandise
save
only
on
sundays
and
feast
days
when
his
cottage
ran
with
soap
and
water
he
was
a
short
man
strong
and
of
a
joyful
countenance
towards
the
end
of
the
day
when
evening
was
coming
on
he
would
sometimes
visit
the
tavern
on
the
road
to
bruges
there
to
rinse
his
throat
with
a
draught
of
cuyte
and
then
the
women
standing
at
their
doorways
to
sniff
the
evening
dew
would
cry
out
to
him
in
friendly
greeting
a
good
night
and
a
good
drink
to
you
a
good
night
to
you
and
a
lively
husband
claes
would
reply
and
sometimes
the
girls
trooping
home
together
from
their
work
in
the
fields
would
line
up
in
front
of
him
right
across
the
road
barring
his
way
what
will
you
give
us
for
the
right
of
passage
they
would
cry
a
scarlet
ribbon
a
buckle
of
gold
a
pair
of
velvet
slippers
or
a
florin
piece
for
alms
but
claes
holding
one
of
the
girls
fast
by
the
waist
would
give
her
a
hearty
kiss
on
her
fresh
cheek
or
on
her
neck
just
whichever
happened
to
be
nearest
and
then
he
would
say
you
must
ask
the
rest
my
dears
of
your
sweethearts
and
off
they
would
go
amidst
peals
of
laughter
as
for
the
children
they
always
recognized
claes
by
his
loud
voice
and
by
the
noise
his
clogs
made
on
the
road
and
they
would
run
up
to
him
and
cry
good
evening
the
same
to
you
my
little
angels
he
would
answer
but
come
no
nearer
lest
perchance
i
turn
you
into
blackamoors
but
the
children
were
bold
and
oftentimes
would
make
the
venture
then
claes
would
seize
one
of
them
by
the
doublet
and
rubbing
his
blackened
hands
up
and
down
the
little
fellow
nose
would
send
him
off
all
sooty
but
laughing
just
the
same
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
others
soetkin
wife
of
claes
was
a
good
wife
and
mother
she
was
up
with
the
dawn
and
worked
as
diligently
as
any
ant
she
and
claes
laboured
together
in
the
field
yoking
themselves
to
the
plough
as
though
they
had
been
oxen
it
was
hard
work
dragging
it
along
but
even
the
plough
was
not
so
heavy
as
the
harrow
that
rustic
implement
whose
task
it
was
to
tear
up
the
hardened
earth
with
teeth
of
wood
but
claes
and
his
wife
worked
always
with
a
gay
heart
and
enlivened
themselves
with
singing
and
in
vain
was
the
earth
hard
in
vain
did
the
sun
hurl
down
on
them
his
hottest
beams
in
vain
were
their
knees
stiffened
with
bending
and
their
loins
tired
with
the
cruel
effort
of
dragging
the
harrow
along
for
they
had
only
to
stop
a
moment
while
soetkin
turned
to
claes
her
gentle
face
and
while
claes
kissed
that
mirror
of
a
gentle
heart
and
straightway
they
forgot
how
tired
they
were
v
now
the
previous
day
the
town
crier
had
given
notice
from
before
the
town
hall
that
madame
the
wife
of
the
emperor
charles
being
near
the
time
of
her
delivery
it
behoved
the
people
to
say
prayers
on
her
behalf
katheline
came
to
claes
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
whatever
is
the
matter
my
good
woman
he
asked
alas
she
cried
catching
her
breath
behold
this
night
the
ghosts
are
mowing
men
down
like
grass
little
girls
are
being
buried
alive
the
executioner
is
dancing
on
the
body
of
the
dead
and
broken
this
night
is
that
stone
which
has
been
sweating
blood
these
nine
months
past
and
more
mercy
on
us
groaned
soetkin
mercy
on
us
o
lord
this
is
a
black
omen
indeed
for
the
land
of
flanders
do
you
see
these
things
with
your
own
eyes
wide
awake
or
perchance
in
a
dream
claes
asked
her
with
my
own
eyes
katheline
told
him
and
then
all
pale
and
tearful
she
continued
in
these
words
two
children
are
born
the
one
in
spain
the
infant
philip
and
the
other
in
this
land
of
flanders
the
son
of
claes
he
that
later
on
shall
be
known
by
the
name
of
ulenspiegel
philip
will
grow
up
to
be
a
common
hangman
being
the
child
of
the
emperor
charles
the
fifth
the
destroyer
of
our
country
but
ulenspiegel
will
be
a
master
of
the
merry
words
and
frolics
of
youth
yet
good
of
heart
withal
having
for
his
father
claes
the
brave
working
man
that
knows
how
to
earn
his
own
living
with
courage
honesty
and
gentleness
charles
the
emperor
and
philip
the
king
will
go
riding
their
way
through
life
doing
evil
by
battle
extortion
and
other
crimes
but
claes
working
hard
all
the
week
living
according
to
right
and
according
to
law
and
laughing
at
his
laborious
lot
instead
of
being
cast
down
thereby
will
be
the
model
of
all
the
good
workpeople
of
flanders
ulenspiegel
young
and
immortal
will
ramble
over
the
world
and
never
settle
in
one
place
and
he
will
be
peasant
nobleman
painter
sculptor
all
in
one
and
he
will
continue
his
wanderings
hither
and
thither
lauding
things
beautiful
and
good
and
laughing
stupidity
to
scorn
claes
then
o
noble
people
of
flanders
is
your
courage
soetkin
your
valiant
motherhood
ulenspiegel
your
soul
a
sweet
and
gentle
maiden
lover
of
ulenspiegel
and
immortal
like
him
shall
be
your
heart
and
lamme
goedzak
with
his
shall
be
your
stomach
and
up
aloft
shall
stand
the
devourers
of
the
people
and
beneath
them
their
victims
on
high
the
thieving
hornets
and
below
the
busy
bees
while
in
heaven
bleed
for
evermore
the
wounds
of
christ
and
when
she
had
thus
spoken
katheline
the
kindly
sorceress
went
to
sleep
vi
one
day
claes
caught
a
large
salmon
and
on
the
sunday
he
and
soetkin
and
katheline
and
the
little
ulenspiegel
had
it
for
their
dinner
but
katheline
only
ate
enough
to
satisfy
a
sparrow
how
now
mother
said
claes
what
has
happened
to
the
air
of
flanders
has
it
suddenly
grown
solid
so
that
to
breathe
it
is
as
nourishing
as
a
plate
of
beef
why
if
such
were
the
case
i
suppose
you
will
be
telling
me
that
the
rain
is
as
good
as
soup
and
the
hail
like
beans
and
the
snow
some
sort
of
celestial
fricassee
fit
cheer
for
a
poor
traveller
but
katheline
shook
her
head
and
said
not
a
word
dear
me
said
claes
our
mother
is
in
the
dumps
it
seems
what
can
it
be
that
grieves
her
so
but
katheline
spake
as
follows
in
a
voice
that
was
like
a
breath
of
wind
the
wicked
night
falls
blackly
he
tells
of
his
coming
from
afar
screaming
like
the
i
tremble
and
pray
to
our
lady
all
in
vain
for
the
night
knows
neither
walls
nor
hedges
neither
doors
nor
windows
everywhere
like
a
spirit
he
finds
a
way
in
the
ladder
creaks
the
night
has
entered
into
the
loft
where
i
am
sleeping
the
night
seizes
me
in
arms
that
are
cold
and
hard
as
marble
his
face
is
frozen
and
his
kisses
like
damp
snow
the
whole
cottage
seems
to
be
tossed
about
over
the
earth
riding
like
a
ship
at
sea
claes
said
i
would
counsel
you
to
go
every
morning
to
mass
that
our
lord
christ
may
give
you
strength
to
chase
away
this
phantom
from
hell
he
is
so
beautiful
said
katheline
vii
ulenspiegel
was
weaned
and
began
to
grow
like
a
young
poplar
and
soon
claes
gave
up
caressing
him
but
loved
him
in
a
roughish
manner
fearing
to
make
a
milksop
of
him
and
when
ulenspiegel
came
home
complaining
that
he
had
got
the
worst
of
it
in
some
boyish
affray
claes
would
give
him
a
beating
because
forsooth
he
had
not
beaten
the
others
and
with
such
an
education
ulenspiegel
grew
up
as
valiant
as
a
young
lion
when
claes
was
from
home
ulenspiegel
would
ask
his
mother
to
give
him
a
liard
with
which
he
might
go
out
and
amuse
himself
soetkin
would
grow
angry
and
ask
why
he
wanted
to
go
out
for
amusement
he
would
do
better
to
stay
at
home
and
tie
up
faggots
and
when
he
saw
that
she
was
not
going
to
give
him
anything
the
boy
would
start
yelling
like
an
eagle
while
soetkin
made
a
great
clatter
with
the
pots
and
pans
that
she
was
washing
in
the
wooden
tub
pretending
that
she
did
not
hear
his
noise
then
ulenspiegel
would
fall
to
weeping
and
the
gentle
mother
would
stop
her
pretence
at
harshness
and
would
come
and
kiss
him
will
a
denier
be
enough
for
you
she
would
say
now
it
should
be
noted
that
a
denier
is
equal
to
six
liards
thus
did
his
mother
dote
on
ulenspiegel
even
to
excess
and
when
claes
was
not
there
he
was
king
in
the
house
viii
one
morning
soetkin
saw
claes
pacing
up
and
down
the
kitchen
with
head
bent
like
a
man
lost
in
thought
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
my
man
she
asked
him
you
are
pale
and
you
look
angry
and
distracted
claes
answered
her
in
a
low
voice
like
a
dog
growling
the
emperor
is
about
to
reissue
those
cursed
placards
death
once
again
is
hovering
over
the
land
of
flanders
the
informers
are
to
have
one
half
of
the
property
of
their
victims
if
so
be
that
such
property
does
not
exceed
the
value
of
one
hundred
florins
we
are
poor
soetkin
said
not
poor
enough
claes
answered
evil
folk
there
are
crows
and
vultures
who
would
as
readily
denounce
us
to
the
emperor
for
half
a
sackful
of
coal
as
for
half
a
sackful
of
florins
what
had
she
poor
old
widow
tanneken
that
was
wife
to
sis
the
tailor
she
that
was
buried
alive
at
heyst
nothing
but
a
latin
bible
three
gold
florins
and
a
few
household
utensils
of
english
pewter
but
they
were
coveted
by
a
neighbour
then
there
was
joanna
martens
whom
they
burnt
as
a
witch
after
she
had
been
thrown
into
the
water
for
her
body
did
not
sink
and
they
held
it
for
a
sign
of
sorcery
she
had
a
few
miserable
pieces
of
furniture
and
seven
gold
pieces
in
a
bag
and
the
informer
wanted
his
half
of
them
alas
i
could
go
on
till
morning
giving
you
instances
of
the
same
kind
but
to
cut
a
long
story
short
mother
life
no
longer
worth
living
in
flanders
and
all
on
account
of
these
placards
soon
every
the
will
be
passing
through
the
town
and
we
shall
hear
the
arid
click
of
bones
as
the
skeletons
shake
in
the
wind
soetkin
said
you
ought
not
to
try
and
frighten
me
my
man
the
emperor
is
the
father
of
flanders
and
brabant
and
as
such
he
is
endowed
with
gentleness
patience
and
pity
he
would
be
obliged
to
renounce
too
much
if
he
were
all
that
claes
answered
for
he
has
inherited
a
great
amount
of
confiscated
property
at
that
very
moment
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
was
heard
and
the
clash
of
the
heralds
cymbals
claes
and
soetkin
carrying
ulenspiegel
in
their
arms
by
turns
rushed
out
towards
where
the
sound
came
from
and
with
them
went
a
great
concourse
of
people
they
came
to
the
town
hall
in
front
of
which
stood
the
heralds
on
horseback
blowing
their
trumpets
and
sounding
their
cymbals
and
the
provost
with
his
staff
of
justice
and
the
town
proctor
also
on
horseback
and
holding
in
his
hands
the
imperial
edict
which
he
was
preparing
to
read
out
to
the
assembled
multitude
claes
heard
every
word
how
that
it
was
once
again
forbidden
to
all
and
sundry
to
print
read
to
possess
or
to
defend
the

well
as
any
copies
of
the
new
testament
printed
by
adrien
de
berghes
christophe
de
remonda
and
joannes
xel
which
books
were
full
of
lutheran
and
other
kinds
of
heresy
and
had
been
condemned
and
rejected
by
the
doctors
of
theology
at
the
university
of
louvain
likewise
and
in
the
same
manner
it
was
forbidden
to
paint
portray
or
cause
to
be
painted
or
portrayed
any
opprobrious
paintings
or
figures
of
god
or
of

furthermore
said
the
placard
no
one
whatever
his
position
in
life
should
presume
to
discuss
or
dispute
concerning
holy
writ
even
in
regard
to
matters
admittedly
doubtful
unless
he
were
a
theologian
well
known
and
approved
by
some
established
university
his
sacred
majesty
decreed
among
other
penalties
that
suspected
persons
should
not
be
allowed
to
carry
on
any
honourable
occupation
and
as
for
men
who
had
fallen
again
into
error
or
who
were
obstinate
in
the
same
they
should
be
condemned
to
be
burnt
by
fire
slow
or
fast
either
in
a
covering
of
straw
or
else
bound
to
a
stake
according
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge
others
if
they
were
men
of
noble
or
of
gentle
birth
were
to
be
executed
at
the
point
of
the
sword
while
working
people
were
to
be
hung
and
the
women
buried
alive
afterwards
their
heads
were
to
be
fixed
on
the
top
of
poles
for
an
example
the
property
of
all
the
aforesaid
in
so
far
as
it
was
situate
in
places
subject
to
confiscation
was
to
be
made
over
to
the
benefit
of
the
emperor
to
the
informers
his
sacred
majesty
gave
one
half
of
all
the
property
of
the
dead
provided
that
such
property
did
not
exceed
on
any
one
occasion
a
hundred
pounds
gross
in
flemish
money
as
for
the
half
that
went
to
the
emperor
he
would
reserve
it
for
works
of
piety
and
mercy
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
the
confiscations
at
rome
and
claes
went
away
sadly
with
soetkin
and
ulenspiegel
ix
once
again
did
soetkin
bear
under
her
girdle
the
sign
of
approaching
motherhood
and
katheline
also
was
in
a
like
condition
but
she
was
afraid
and
never
ventured
out
of
her
house
when
soetkin
went
to
see
her
alas
said
katheline
what
shall
i
do
must
i
smother
the
fruit
of
my
womb
i
would
rather
die
myself
and
yet
if
the
sergeant
summons
me
for
having
a
child
without
being
married
they
will
make
me
pay
twenty
florins
like
a
girl
of
no
reputation
and
i
shall
be
flogged
in
the
market
square
soetkin
consoled
and
comforted
her
as
sweetly
as
she
could
then
left
her
and
returned
thoughtfully
home
one
day
she
said
to
claes
if
i
brought
two
children
into
the
world
instead
of
one
would
you
be
angry
would
you
beat
me
my
man
that
i
can
not
say
claes
answered
but
if
the
second
were
not
really
mine
but
turned
out
to
be
like
this
child
of
katheline
the
offspring
of
some
one
unknown
the
devil
maybe
devils
beget
fire
death
smoke
claes
replied
but
children
no
yet
will
i
take
for
my
own
the
child
of
katheline
you
will
cried
soetkin
you
really
will
i
have
said
it
claes
replied
soetkin
hurried
off
to
tell
katheline
the
news
who
when
she
heard
it
could
not
contain
her
delight
but
cried
aloud
with
joy
he
has
spoken
the
good
man
and
his
words
are
the
salvation
of
my
body
he
will
be
blessed
by
god
and
blessed
by
the
devil
as
well
if
really
and
she
trembled
as
she
spoke
the
words
if
really
it
is
the
devil
who
is
father
to
the
little
one
that
begins
to
stir
beneath
my
breast
and
in
due
time
soetkin
and
katheline
brought
into
the
world
the
one
a
baby
boy
and
the
other
a
baby
girl
both
were
brought
to
baptism
as
the
children
of
claes
soetkin
son
was
christened
hans
and
did
not
live
but
katheline
daughter
who
was
christened
nele
grew
up
finely
she
drank
of
the
liquor
of
life
from
a
fourfold
flagon
two
of
the
flagons
belonged
to
katheline
and
two
were
soetkin
and
there
was
many
a
sweet
dispute
as
to
whose
turn
it
was
to
give
the
child
to
drink
but
much
against
her
will
katheline
was
obliged
to
let
her
milk
dry
up
lest
questions
should
be
asked
as
to
where
it
came
from
and
she
no
mother
but
when
the
little
nele
that
was
her
daughter
was
weaned
then
katheline
took
her
home
to
live
with
her
nor
did
she
let
her
go
back
to
soetkin
except
when
nele
called
for
her
mother
the
neighbours
said
that
it
was
a
right
and
natural
thing
to
do
for
katheline
to
look
after
the
child
of
claes
and
soetkin
for
they
were
needy
and
whereas
katheline
was
comparatively
well
off
x
one
day
soetkin
said
to
claes
husband
i
am
this
is
now
the
third
day
that
tyl
has
been
away
know
you
not
where
he
is
claes
answered
her
sadly
he
is
with
all
the
others
roving
vagabonds
like
himself
on
the
high
road
verily
it
was
cruel
of
god
to
give
us
such
a
son
when
he
was
born
i
thought
of
him
as
the
joy
of
our
old
age
and
as
another
help
in
our
house
for
i
hoped
to
make
a
good
workman
of
him
but
now
some
evil
chance
hath
turned
him
into
a
thief
and
a
you
are
too
hard
on
him
my
man
said
soetkin
he
is
our
son
and
he
is
but
nine
years
old
and
filled
with
childish
folly
it
is
needful
that
he
also
like
the
trees
of
the
field
should
let
fall
his
husks
by
the
wayside
ere
he
decks
himself
with
the
full
foliage
of
virtue
and
honesty
he
is
mischievous
i
do
not
deny
it
but
later
on
this
spirit
of
his
will
be
turned
to
good
account
if
instead
of
driving
him
to
tricks
and
frolics
it
is
put
to
some
useful
purpose
he
makes
fun
of
the
neighbours
true
but
one
day
you
will
find
him
take
his
rightful
place
in
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
gay
and
happy
friends
he
is
always
laughing
and
frivolous
yes
but
a
young
face
that
is
too
serious
bodes
ill
for
the
future
and
if
he
is
always
running
about
it
is
because
his
growing
body
needs
to
be
exercised
and
if
he
is
idle
and
does
no
work
it
is
because
he
is
not
yet
old
enough
to
feel
the
duty
of
labour
and
if
now
and
then
he
does
stay
away
from
us
for
half
a
week
at
a
time
it
is
only
because
he
fails
to
realize
the
grief
he
causes
us
for
he
has
a
good
heart
husband
and
at
bottom
he
loves
us
claes
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
and
went
to
sleep
leaving
soetkin
to
her
lonely
tears
and
she
in
the
morning
afraid
lest
her
son
had
fallen
sick
upon
the
road
went
out
and
stood
at
the
cottage
doorstep
to
see
if
he
were
coming
back
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
and
she
came
back
into
the
cottage
and
sat
by
the
window
gazing
out
all
the
time
into
the
street
and
many
a
time
did
her
heart
dance
within
her
bosom
at
the
light
footfall
of
some
urchin
that
she
thought
might
be
her
own
but
when
the
sound
passed
by
and
she
knew
that
it
was
not
ulenspiegel
then
she
wept
poor
mother
that
she
was
ulenspiegel
meanwhile
with
the
that
bore
him
company
was
away
at
bruges
at
the
saturday
market
there
were
to
be
seen
the
shoemakers
and
the
cobblers
each
in
his
separate
stall
the
tailors
selling
suits
of
clothes
the
miesevangers
from
antwerp
they
that
snare
by
night
with
the
aid
of
an
owl
and
the
poulterers
too
and
the
rascally
and
sellers
of
catskins
that
are
made
into
gloves
and
of
and
doublets
buyers
too
of
every
kind
townsmen
and
townswomen
valets
servants
pantlers
and
butlers
and
cooks
male
and
female
all
together
buying
and
selling
each
according
to
his
quality
shouting
his
wares
crying
up
or
crying
down
with
every
trick
of
the
trade
now
in
one
corner
of
the
stood
a
wonderful
tent
made
of
cloth
raised
aloft
on
four
piles
at
the
door
of
the
tent
was
a
peasant
from
the
level
land
of
alost
and
by
his
side
two
monks
begged
for
alms
for
the
sum
of
one
patard
the
peasant
offered
to
show
to
the
curious
or
devout
a
genuine
piece
of
the
of
mary
of
egypt
there
he
was
yelling
out
in
his
broken
voice
the
merits
of
the
saint
and
not
omitting
from
his
song
that
tale
which
tells
how
she
being
without
money
paid
the
young
ferryman
in
the
beautiful
coinage
of
nature
herself
lest
by
refusing
a
workman
his
due
she
might
be
guilty
of
sin
and
all
the
while
the
two
monks
kept
nodding
their
heads
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
was
gospel
truth
that
the
peasant
was
speaking
and
at
their
side
was
a
fat
woman
as
as
astarte
blowing
a
raucous
bagpipe
while
at
her
side
a
young
girl
sang
in
a
voice
sweet
as
a
bird
though
no
one
heeded
her
now
above
the
door
of
the
tent
and
swung
between
two
poles
by
a
cord
fastened
to
either
handle
was
a
tub
of
holy
water
which
the
fat
woman
affirmed
had
been
brought
from
rome
and
the
two
monks
lolled
their
heads
backwards
and
forwards
in
confirmation
or
what
she
said
ulenspiegel
looking
at
the
tub
grew
suddenly
thoughtful
for
to
one
of
the
posts
of
the
tent
was
tied
a
donkey
a
donkey
that
to
all
appearance
was
wont
to
feed
on
hay
rather
than
on
oats
for
its
head
was
down
and
it
scanned
the
earth
in
futile
hopes
of
seeing
but
a
thistle
growing
there
comrades
said
ulenspiegel
pointing
to
the
fat
old
woman
the
two
monks
and
the
melancholy
donkey
since
the
masters
play
so
well
let
us
also
make
the
donkey
dance
and
so
saying
he
went
to
a
stall
close
by
and
purchased
six
worth
of
pepper
then
he
lifted
up
the
tail
of
the
donkey
and
placed
the
pepper
underneath
it
when
the
donkey
began
to
feel
the
sting
of
the
pepper
he
cast
his
eye
backwards
under
his
tail
endeavouring
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
unaccustomed
heat
thinking
that
it
must
be
at
the
least
some
fiery
devil
from
hell
the
donkey
conceived
the
not
unnatural
desire
to
run
away
and
escape
him
so
he
began
to
bray
as
loud
as
he
could
and
to
kick
up
his
heels
and
to
shake
the
post
with
all
his
strength
at
the
first
shock
the
tub
hanging
between
the
two
poles
tipped
over
and
the
holy
water
ran
about
over
the
tent
and
over
those
that
were
inside
and
soon
the
tent
itself
collapsed
covering
with
a
dripping
mantle
all
those
who
were
listening
to
the
wondrous
tale
of
mary
of
egypt
and
ulenspiegel
and
his
comrades
could
hear
a
mighty
noise
issuing
from
beneath
the
tent
a
noise
of
moaning
and
lamentation
for
the
devout
folk
that
were
within
began
to
accuse
one
another
of
having
overturned
the
tub
and
presently
grew
red
with
rage
and
fell
upon
each
other
with
many
furious
blows
the
tent
began
to
bulge
here
and
there
above
the
frantic
efforts
of
the
combatants
and
each
time
that
ulenspiegel
descried
some
rounded
form
outlined
through
the
cloth
of
the
tent
he
went
and
gave
it
a
prick
with
a
pin
this
was
the
signal
for
new
and
louder
cries
and
for
fiercer
and
more
general
fisticuffs
ulenspiegel
was
delighted
and
soon
he
was
to
become
even
more
so
when
he
saw
the
donkey
begin
to
run
away
dragging
behind
him
tent
tub
and
all
while
the
master
of
the
tent
with
his
wife
and
daughter
hung
on
behind
the
baggage
at
last
the
donkey
being
able
to
go
no
farther
raised
his
nose
in
the
air
and
gave
vent
to
bray
after
bray
a
music
that
only
ceased
at
those
moments
when
he
was
looking
back
under
his
tail
to
see
if
the
fire
that
still
raged
there
would
not
soon
go
out
all
this
time
the
devout
assembly
in
the
tent
were
still
but
the
two
monks
without
troubling
at
all
about
what
was
going
on
inside
began
to
gather
up
the
money
that
had
fallen
from
the
and
ulenspiegel
assisted
them
devotedly
but
not
without
some
profit
to
himself
xi
now
all
this
time
that
the
vagabond
son
of
the
was
growing
up
in
merriment
and
mischief
the
moody
scion
of
his
sacred
majesty
the
emperor
was
vegetating
like
a
weed
in
moody
melancholy
the
lords
and
ladies
of
the
court
used
to
watch
him
as
he
mouched
along
the
rooms
and
passages
of
the
palace
at
valladolid
a
frail
pitiful
specimen
of
humanity
with
legs
that
shook
and
scarce
seemed
able
to
support
the
weight
of
the
big
head
that
was
covered
with
stiff
blond
hair
he
loved
to
haunt
dark
corridors
and
he
would
stay
sitting
there
whole
hours
together
with
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
hoping
that
some
valet
or
other
might
trip
over
them
by
mistake
then
he
would
have
the
fellow
flogged
for
he
took
pleasure
in
listening
to
his
cries
under
the
lash
but
he
never
laughed
another
day
he
would
select
some
other
corridor
in
which
to
lay
a
similar
trap
and
once
again
he
would
sit
himself
down
with
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
then
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
mayhap
or
one
of
the
lords
or
pages
would
stumble
across
him
and
if
they
fell
down
and
hurt
themselves
he
took
delight
in
their
discomfiture
but
he
never
laughed
and
if
by
chance
any
one
knocked
against
him
but
did
not
fall
down
he
would
cry
out
as
if
he
had
been
struck
he
liked
to
see
the
other
fright
but
he
never
laughed
his
sacred
majesty
was
informed
of
these
and
he
commanded
that
no
notice
should
be
taken
of
the
child
saying
that
if
his
son
did
not
want
people
to
walk
over
his
legs
he
should
not
place
his
legs
in
a
position
where
they
were
liable
to
be
walked
over
philip
was
angry
at
this
but
he
said
nothing
and
was
no
more
seen
till
one
fine
summer
day
when
he
went
out
into
the
courtyard
to
warm
his
shivering
body
in
the
sun
charles
riding
back
from
the
war
saw
his
son
thus
brewing
his
melancholy
how
now
cried
the
emperor
what
a
difference
there
is
between
us
two
my
son
at
your
age
i
loved
nothing
better
than
to
go
climbing
trees
after
squirrels
or
with
the
aid
of
a
rope
to
clamber
down
some
steep
cliff
to
take
young
eagles
out
of
their
nests
i
might
easily
have
broken
my
bones
at
the
game
but
they
only
grew
the
harder
and
when
i
went
out
hunting
the
deer
fled
into
the
thickets
at
sight
of
me
armed
with
my
trusty
arquebus
ah
my
lord
father
sighed
the
child
but
you
see
i
have
the
for
that
said
charles
good
wine
from
paxarete
is
a
most
certain
remedy
i
do
like
wine
i
have
a
headache
my
lord
father
then
you
should
run
and
jump
and
play
about
like
other
children
of
your
age
i
have
stiff
legs
my
lord
father
and
how
should
it
be
otherwise
said
charles
seeing
that
you
make
no
more
use
of
them
than
if
they
were
of
wood
but
you
shall
go
riding
on
a
horse
the
child
began
to
cry
oh
no
for
mercy
sake
i
have
a
pain
in
my
back
come
come
said
charles
are
you
ill
everywhere
then
i
should
not
be
ill
at
all
answered
the
child
if
only
they
would
let
me
alone
do
you
think
to
pass
your
royal
life
away
in
dreams
like
a
scholar
the
emperor
asked
impatiently
such
people
as
that
if
indeed
it
be
necessary
for
the
inking
of
their
parchments
may
rightly
seek
out
silence
solitude
retirement
from
the
world
but
for
thee
son
of
the
sword
i
would
desire
warm
blood
a
lynx
eye
a
craft
and
the
strength
of
hercules
why
do
you
cross
yourself
blood
of
god
what
should
a
lion
cub
be
doing
with
this
mimicry
of
women
at
their
prayers
hark
it
is
the
angelus
my
lord
father
answered
the
child
xii
may
and
june
that
year
were
in
very
truth
the
months
of
flowers
never
had
flanders
known
the
hawthorn
so
fragrant
never
the
gardens
so
gay
with
roses
jasmine
and
honeysuckle
and
when
the
wind
blew
eastwards
from
england
it
carried
with
it
the
breath
of
all
this
flowery
land
and
the
people
at
antwerp
and
elsewhere
sniffed
the
air
joyfully
and
cried
aloud
how
good
the
scent
of
the
wind
that
blows
from
flanders
then
it
was
that
the
bees
were
busy
sucking
honey
from
the
flowers
making
wax
and
laying
their
eggs
within
the
hives
that
were
all
too
small
to
house
the
swarms
what
workman
music
they
made
under
that
canopy
of
azure
sky
that
was
spread
so
dazzlingly
over
the
rich
earth
the
hives
were
made
of
rushes
straw
osiers
or
of
wattled
hay
and
there
the
bees
like
clever
lined
and
tunnelled
the
hives
with
their
beautifully
fitting
tools
and
as
for
the
this
long
time
past
their
numbers
were
scarce
sufficient
for
the
work
they
had
to
do
in
a
single
swarm
there
would
be
as
many
as
three
thousand
bees
and
two
thousand
seven
hundred
drones
the
quality
of
the
comb
was
so
exquisite
that
the
dean
of
damme
dispatched
eleven
combs
to
the
emperor
charles
out
of
gratitude
for
the
new
edicts
that
had
revived
in
flanders
the
earlier
vigour
of
the
holy
inquisition
it
was
philip
forsooth
that
ate
them
all
but
little
good
did
they
do
him
but
in
flanders
the
rascals
of
the
roads
the
beggars
and
vagabonds
and
all
that
lazy
crowd
who
would
risk
hanging
rather
than
do
a
day
work
were
soon
enticed
by
the
taste
of
the
honey
to
come
along
and
steal
their
share
and
by
night
they
prowled
around
the
hives
in
gangs
now
claes
had
made
some
hives
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
the
wandering
swarms
of
bees
and
some
of
these
hives
were
full
already
but
there
were
others
that
stood
empty
waiting
for
the
bees
claes
kept
watch
all
night
to
guard
this
sugary
wealth
of
his
and
when
he
was
tired
he
asked
ulenspiegel
to
take
his
place
the
which
ulenspiegel
did
right
willingly
it
was
a
cold
night
and
ulenspiegel
to
avoid
the
chill
took
refuge
in
one
of
the
hives
curling
himself
up
inside
and
looking
out
from
two
openings
that
had
been
made
in
the
roof
of
the
hive
just
as
he
was
going
off
to
sleep
he
heard
a
rustle
in
the
bushy
hedge
near
by
and
then
the
voices
of
two
men
they
were
thieves
no
doubt
and
peering
forth
from
the
openings
aforesaid
ulenspiegel
saw
that
they
both
had
long
hair
and
long
beards
which
was
strange
for
a
long
beard
is
usually
the
sign
of
a
nobleman
however
the
two
men
went
peering
from
hive
to
hive
and
coming
at
last
to
the
one
in
which
ulenspiegel
was
hiding
they
tried
its
weight
and
then
let
us
take
this
one
they
said
it
is
the
heaviest
whereupon
they
slung
it
up
between
them
on
a
couple
of
poles
and
carried
it
off
ulenspiegel
did
not
at
all
fancy
being
thus
carted
away
in
a
hive
but
the
night
was
clear
and
the
two
thieves
marched
along
with
never
a
word
when
they
had
gone
about
fifty
paces
they
would
stop
to
take
breath
and
then
set
off
again
the
man
in
front
grumbled
angrily
all
the
time
at
the
weight
of
his
burden
and
the
man
behind
whined
in
a
querulous
fashion
even
so
are
there
always
to
be
found
two
sorts
of
idle
fellows
in
this
world
those
who
are
angry
at
having
to
work
and
those
who
merely
whine
at
having
to
ulenspiegel
since
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
took
hold
of
the
hair
of
the
man
in
front
and
gave
it
a
pull
and
he
did
the
same
to
the
beard
of
the
man
at
the
rear
and
to
such
purpose
that
the
two
men
soon
grew
annoyed
at
what
was
happening
and
mr
angry
said
to
whining
hi
there
stop
pulling
my
hair
you
or
else
i
give
you
such
a
whack
on
the
head
that
it
squash
down
into
your
chest
and
then
you
be
looking
out
of
your
two
sides
like
a
thief
through
the
prison
grille
i
should
never
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
as
to
pull
your
hair
said
the
whiner
but
what
are
you
doing
there
pulling
at
my
beard
to
which
mr
angry
made
answer
it
is
i
that
would
go
hunting
for
fleas
in
the
wool
of
a
leper
o
sir
said
the
whiner
for
goodness
sake
do
go
shaking
the
hive
about
like
this
my
poor
arms
can
not
support
it
any
longer
i
shall
shake
it
out
of
your
arms
altogether
said
the
other
then
unloading
himself
he
placed
the
hive
upon
the
ground
and
fell
upon
his
companion
and
so
they
fought
together
the
one
cursing
and
the
other
crying
out
for
mercy
ulenspiegel
hearing
the
sound
of
blows
came
out
from
the
hive
dragged
it
behind
him
into
the
wood
close
by
and
having
placed
it
where
he
could
find
it
again
returned
to
claes
and
thus
you
may
see
what
sort
of
a
profit
it
is
that
thieves
derive
from
their
quarrels
xiii
as
he
grew
up
ulenspiegel
acquired
the
habit
of
wandering
about
among
the
fairs
and
markets
of
the
and
whenever
he
hit
upon
a
man
who
played
the
oboe
the
rebec
or
the
bagpipes
he
would
offer
him
a
patard
for
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
making
those
instruments
to
sing
he
became
especially
accomplished
in
the
art
of
playing
the
rommelpot
an
instrument
which
is
constructed
out
of
a
round
pot
a
bladder
and
a
straight
piece
of
straw
and
this
is
the
way
he
played
it
first
of
all
he
moistened
the
bladder
and
held
it
over
the
pot
then
he
drew
the
centre
of
the
bladder
round
the
joint
of
a
straw
which
itself
was
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
pot
finally
he
stretched
the
bladder
as
tightly
as
he
dared
over
the
sides
of
the
pot
in
the
morning
when
the
bladder
was
dry
it
sounded
like
a
tambourine
when
struck
and
if
one
rubbed
the
straw
it
gave
forth
a
humming
sound
as
fine
in
tone
as
that
of
any
violin
and
ulenspiegel
with
his
musical
pot
that
played
music
like
the
baying
of
a
mastiff
went
out
with
the
other
children
on
the
day
of
epiphany
carrying
a
star
made
of
luminous
paper
and
singing
carols
sometimes
an
artist
would
come
to
damme
to
paint
the
members
of
one
of
the
guilds
upon
their
knees
ulenspiegel
was
always
anxious
to
see
how
the
artist
worked
and
he
would
beg
to
be
allowed
to
grind
the
colours
in
return
for
nothing
but
a
slice
of
bread
three
liards
and
a
pint
of
ale
but
while
he
worked
away
at
the
grinding
he
would
carefully
study
the
method
of
his
master
when
the
artist
went
away
ulenspiegel
would
endeavour
to
paint
pictures
like
him
and
his
favourite
colour
was
scarlet
in
this
way
he
tried
to
paint
the
portraits
of
claes
of
soetkin
and
of
katheline
and
nele
as
well
as
those
of
the
pots
and
pans
in
the
kitchen
when
claes
beheld
these
works
of
art
he
predicted
that
if
only
he
worked
hard
enough
ulenspiegel
would
one
day
be
able
to
earn
florins
by
the
dozen
for
painting
the
inscriptions
on
the
festal
cars
or
as
they
are
called
in
zeeland
and
the
land
of
flanders
ulenspiegel
also
learnt
to
carve
in
wood
and
in
stone
for
once
a
came
to
damme
to
carve
a
stall
in
the
choir
of
notre
dame
and
this
stall
was
made
in
such
a
way
that
the
dean
who
was
an
old
man
could
sit
down
when
he
so
desired
yet
seem
to
all
appearance
as
if
he
were
still
standing
upright
it
was
ulenspiegel
too
who
made
the
first
carved
ever
used
by
the
people
of
zeeland
he
fashioned
this
handle
in
the
form
of
a
cage
inside
was
a
death
head
that
moved
and
above
it
a
hound
couchant
and
this
was
the
signification
soul
true
till
death
thus
it
was
that
ulenspiegel
began
to
fulfil
the
prophecy
that
katheline
had
made
when
she
said
that
he
would
be
painter
sculptor
workman
nobleman
all
in
one
for
you
must
know
that
from
father
to
son
the
family
of
claes
bore
arms
three
pint
pots
argent
au
naturel
on
a
ground
bruinbier
but
ulenspiegel
would
stick
to
no
one
profession
and
claes
told
him
that
if
he
went
on
in
this
way
he
would
chase
him
out
of
the
house
xiv
on
his
return
from
the
wars
the
emperor
wanted
to
know
why
his
son
philip
was
not
there
to
welcome
him
the
archbishop
the
royal
governor
said
that
the
child
had
refused
to
leave
his
solitude
and
the
books
which
were
the
only
things
he
loved
the
emperor
asked
where
he
was
to
be
found
at
the
moment
the
governor
did
not
know
exactly
but
said
they
had
better
go
and
look
for
him
somewhere
where
it
was
dark
this
they
did
when
they
had
looked
through
a
good
number
of
rooms
they
came
at
last
to
a
kind
of
closet
unpaved
and
lit
only
by
a
skylight
there
they
found
a
stake
stuck
into
the
ground
and
a
dear
little
monkey
bound
to
the
stake
by
a
cord
round
the
waist
now
this
monkey
had
been
sent
from
the
indies
as
a
present
to
his
highness
to
amuse
him
with
its
youthful
gambols
round
the
bottom
of
the
stake
were
some
smoking
sticks
still
glowing
and
the
closet
was
filled
with
a
foul
smell
as
of
burning
hair
the
poor
animal
had
suffered
so
much
pain
while
being
burnt
to
death
that
its
little
body
no
longer
looked
the
body
of
a
living
animal
but
seemed
rather
like
the
fragment
of
some
root
all
wrinkled
and
distorted
and
its
mouth
still
open
with
the
was
filled
with
froth
mixed
with
blood
and
the
face
was
wet
with
tears
who
has
done
this
said
the
emperor
the
governor
did
not
dare
to
answer
and
the
two
men
stood
there
silent
sad
and
angry
all
at
once
in
the
silence
there
was
heard
a
sound
of
feeble
coughing
that
came
from
a
corner
in
the
shadow
behind
them
his
majesty
turned
and
beheld
philip
his
son
dressed
all
in
black
sucking
an
orange
don
philip
he
said
come
and
greet
your
father
the
child
did
not
move
but
gazed
at
his
father
with
timid
eyes
that
showed
no
spark
of
love
is
it
you
asked
the
emperor
who
have
burnt
alive
in
the
fire
this
little
animal
the
child
bowed
his
head
but
the
emperor
if
you
have
been
cruel
enough
to
do
such
a
deed
at
least
be
brave
enough
to
own
up
to
it
the
child
made
no
answer
his
majesty
seized
the
orange
from
the
child
hands
threw
it
to
the
ground
and
was
about
to
beat
his
son
who
was
shaking
with
terror
when
the
archbishop
restrained
him
whispering
in
his
ear
the
day
will
surely
come
when
his
highness
shall
prove
a
mighty
burner
of
heretics
the
emperor
smiled
and
the
two
of
them
went
away
leaving
philip
alone
with
the
monkey
but
others
there
were
not
monkeys
that
were
destined
to
meet
their
death
in
the
flames
xv
november
was
come
the
month
of
when
sufferers
from
cold
in
the
head
abandon
themselves
freely
to
their
concerts
of
coughing
and
spitting
this
also
is
the
month
when
the
are
filled
with
gangs
of
youths
that
there
disport
themselves
and
steal
whatever
they
can
to
the
mighty
wrath
of
the
peasants
who
try
in
vain
to
catch
them
chasing
after
them
with
sticks
and
pitchforks
well
on
an
evening
when
ulenspiegel
was
returning
home
from
one
of
these
raids
he
heard
close
by
in
a
corner
of
the
hedgerow
a
sound
as
of
groaning
he
leant
down
and
beheld
a
dog
lying
stretched
out
on
the
stones
hallo
he
cried
poor
little
beast
what
are
you
doing
out
here
so
late
at
night
he
patted
the
dog
and
found
that
its
back
was
all
wet
as
though
some
one
had
been
trying
to
drown
it
he
took
it
in
his
arms
to
warm
it
and
when
he
had
reached
home
he
said
i
have
brought
back
a
wounded
animal
what
shall
we
do
with
it
dress
its
wounds
said
claes
ulenspiegel
laid
the
dog
on
the
table
whereupon
he
and
claes
and
soetkin
saw
that
it
was
a
little
luxemburg
terrier
and
that
it
was
wounded
in
the
back
soetkin
sponged
the
wounds
and
anointed
them
with
ointment
and
bound
them
up
with
linen
bandages
then
ulenspiegel
took
the
dog
and
put
it
in
his
bed
but
soetkin
desired
to
have
it
in
her
own
saying
she
was
afraid
that
ulenspiegel
would
hurt
the
little
thing
for
in
those
days
ulenspiegel
was
wont
to
toss
about
in
his
sleep
all
night
like
a
young
devil
in
a
stoup
of
holy
water
ulenspiegel
however
had
his
way
and
he
took
such
care
of
the
dog
that
in
the
space
of
six
days
it
was
walking
about
like
any
other
dog
and
giving
itself
great
airs
and
the
village
schoolmaster
christened
him
titus
bibulus
schnouffius
titus
after
a
certain
good
emperor
of
the
romans
who
was
fond
of
befriending
lost
dogs
bibulus
because
the
dog
loved
beer
with
all
the
passion
of
a
confirmed
drunkard
and
schnouffius
because
he
would
always
run
about
sniffing
and
putting
his
nose
into
every
and
he
could
find
xvi
the
young
prince
of
spain
was
now
fifteen
years
old
and
his
custom
was
to
wander
about
the
rooms
and
passages
and
stairways
of
the
castle
but
chiefly
was
he
to
be
found
prowling
around
the
women
quarters
trying
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
one
of
the
pages
who
themselves
were
wont
to
lurk
on
the
look
out
like
cats
in
the
corridors
while
others
again
out
in
the
courtyard
would
stand
singing
some
tender
ballad
nose
in
air
when
the
young
prince
heard
one
singing
thus
he
would
show
himself
at
one
of
the
windows
and
the
heart
of
that
poor
page
would
be
stricken
with
fear
as
he
saw
that
white
face
there
instead
of
the
gentle
eyes
of
his
beloved
now
among
the
ladies
of
the
court
there
was
a
gentle
dame
from
dudzeel
near
by
damme
in
flanders
she
was
like
fine
ripe
fruit
and
marvellously
beautiful
for
she
had
green
eyes
and
reddish
hair
all
wavy
and
gleaming
gold
and
of
a
gay
humour
was
she
and
of
an
ardent
complexion
nor
did
she
make
any
effort
to
conceal
her
taste
for
that
fortunate
lord
to
whom
for
the
time
being
she
was
pleased
to
grant
the
freedom
of
the
fair
estate
of
her
love
such
a
one
there
was
even
now
handsome
and
proud
and
she
loved
him
well
every
day
at
a
certain
hour
she
went
to
find
him
a
thing
which
philip
was
not
long
in
finding
out
so
one
day
sitting
himself
down
on
a
bench
that
stood
against
a
window
he
lay
in
wait
for
her
and
there
she
saw
him
as
she
passed
by
with
her
bright
eyes
and
her
mouth
half
open
all
meet
for
love
and
fresh
from
her
bath
with
the
gear
of
her
dress
of
yellow
brocade
swinging
about
her
as
she
stepped
along
without
rising
from
his
seat
philip
accosted
her
madame
says
he
could
you
not
spare
a
moment
restive
as
some
eager
mare
stayed
in
her
course
towards
the
gallant
stallion
that
is
neighing
for
her
in
the
field
the
lady
made
answer
all
here
must
needs
obey
the
royal
will
of
your
highness
then
sit
you
down
by
my
side
said
the
prince
and
gazing
at
her
lewdly
harshly
cunningly
he
spake
again
i
would
have
you
recite
to
me
the
pater
noster
in
flemish
they
taught
it
me
once
but
i
no
longer
remember
it
the
poor
lady
did
as
she
was
bid
and
then
the
prince
commanded
her
to
say
it
all
over
again
but
more
slowly
and
so
on
and
so
on
until
she
had
recited
it
ten
times
over
after
that
he
began
to
speak
flatteringly
to
her
praising
her
beautiful
hair
her
fresh
complexion
and
her
bright
eyes
but
he
dared
not
to
say
a
word
concerning
her
lovely
shoulders
or
her
rounded
throat
or
of
aught
else
beside
when
at
last
she
was
beginning
to
hope
that
she
might
be
able
to
get
away
and
was
already
scanning
anxiously
the
courtyard
where
her
lord
was
awaiting
her
the
prince
demanded
of
her
if
she
could
rightly
tell
him
what
were
the
several
virtues
of
woman
she
answered
nothing
fearing
that
she
might
say
something
to
displease
him
he
then
answered
for
her
setting
the
matter
forth
in
this
wise
the
virtues
of
woman
are
these
chastity
regard
for
her
own
honour
and
a
modest
manner
of
life
and
he
counselled
her
therefore
that
she
should
dress
decently
and
should
always
be
careful
to
hide
those
things
which
were
meet
to
be
hidden
the
lady
nodded
assent
saying
that
for
his
hyperborean
highness
she
would
certainly
take
care
to
cover
herself
with
ten
rather
than
with
a
single
length
of
muslin
having
put
him
to
shame
by
this
answer
she
made
off
gladly
but
in
philip
heart
the
fire
of
youth
was
alight
not
the
fiery
glow
that
dares
the
souls
of
the
brave
to
lofty
deeds
but
a
dark
fire
from
hell
itself
the
fire
of
satan
and
it
flamed
in
his
grey
eyes
like
the
beam
of
a
winter
moon
shining
down
upon
a
and
it
burned
within
him
cruelly
xvii
now
this
beautiful
lady
left
valladolid
one
day
for
her
château
of
dudzeel
in
flanders
passing
through
damme
with
her
fat
attendant
behind
her
she
noticed
a
lad
of
about
fifteen
years
of
age
sitting
against
the
wall
of
a
cottage
blowing
a
pair
of
bagpipes
in
front
of
him
was
a
dog
with
red
hair
howling
dismally
because
as
it
seemed
he
did
not
at
all
appreciate
the
music
which
his
master
was
making
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
at
the
lad
side
there
stood
a
pretty
young
girl
in
fits
of
laughter
at
the
pitiful
howling
of
the
dog
this
then
was
the
sight
that
met
the
eye
of
the
beautiful
lady
and
her
fat
attendant
as
they
passed
in
front
of
the
cottage
none
else
but
ulenspiegel
blowing
his
pipes
and
nele
in
fits
of
laughter
and
titus
bibulus
schnouffius
howling
with
all
his
might
you
naughty
boy
said
the
dame
to
ulenspiegel
will
you
never
stop
making
this
poor
howl
like
this
but
ulenspiegel
staring
back
at
her
blew
his
pipes
more
valiantly
than
ever
and
bibulus
schnouffius
howled
the
more
dismally
and
nele
laughed
all
the
louder
the
lady
attendant
grew
angry
and
pointed
at
ulenspiegel
saying
if
i
beat
this
wretched
little
imp
of
a
man
with
the
scabbard
of
my
sword
he
would
give
over
his
insolent
row
ulenspiegel
looked
the
attendant
in
the
face
and
called
him
jan
papzak
because
of
his
fat
belly
and
went
on
blowing
his
bagpipes
the
attendant
came
up
to
him
and
threatened
him
with
his
fist
but
bibulus
schnouffius
went
for
him
straightway
and
bit
him
in
the
leg
and
the
man
fell
down
crying
for
mercy
help
help
the
dame
only
smiled
and
said
to
ulenspiegel
tell
me
my
player
of
bagpipes
is
the
road
still
the
same
that
leads
from
damme
to
dudzeel
but
ulenspiegel
went
on
playing
and
only
nodded
his
head
and
stared
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
fixedly
she
asked
him
but
he
still
continuing
to
play
opened
his
eyes
all
the
wider
as
though
transported
by
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
are
you
not
ashamed
she
said
young
as
you
are
to
stare
at
ladies
so
ulenspiegel
blushed
faintly
but
went
on
blowing
his
pipes
and
staring
more
than
ever
i
have
already
asked
you
once
the
lady
insisted
whether
the
road
is
still
the
same
that
leads
from
damme
to
dudzeel
it
is
green
no
longer
since
you
deprived
it
of
the
honour
of
carrying
you
ulenspiegel
answered
will
you
show
me
the
way
said
the
lady
but
ulenspiegel
still
remained
sitting
where
he
was
and
still
went
on
staring
at
her
and
she
seeing
him
so
roguish
and
knowing
it
all
for
the
gamesomeness
of
youth
forgave
him
willingly
he
got
up
at
last
and
began
to
walk
back
into
the
cottage
whither
are
you
going
she
asked
him
to
put
on
my
best
clothes
he
replied
very
well
she
said
then
the
lady
sat
herself
down
on
the
bench
close
to
the
doorstep
and
tried
to
talk
to
nele
but
nele
would
not
answer
her
for
she
was
jealous
it
was
not
long
before
ulenspiegel
returned
well
washed
and
clothed
in
fustian
he
looked
fine
in
his
sunday
clothes
the
little
man
are
you
really
going
off
with
this
fine
lady
nele
asked
him
i
shall
soon
be
back
he
told
her
let
me
go
instead
of
you
said
nele
no
he
said
the
roads
are
muddy
why
little
girl
said
the
lady
who
was
annoyed
and
jealous
now
in
her
turn
why
do
you
try
to
hinder
him
from
coming
with
me
nele
did
not
answer
but
great
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
and
she
gazed
at
the
fine
lady
in
sadness
and
in
anger
then
the
four
of
them
started
off
the
dame
seated
like
a
queen
upon
her
ambling
palfrey
the
attendant
with
his
belly
that
shook
with
every
step
ulenspiegel
holding
the
lady
horse
by
the
bridle
and
bibulus
schnouffius
walking
at
his
side
tail
proudly
in
air
thus
went
they
on
horseback
and
on
foot
for
some
long
while
but
ulenspiegel
was
not
at
his
ease
dumb
as
a
fish
he
sniffed
the
fine
scent
of
benjamin
that
floated
from
the
lady
and
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
all
her
beautiful
gear
rare
jewels
and
trinkets
and
the
sweet
expression
of
her
face
her
bright
eyes
and
bare
neck
and
her
hair
that
shone
in
the
sunlight
like
a
hood
of
gold
why
are
you
so
quiet
my
little
man
she
asked
him
he
answered
nothing
do
you
keep
your
tongue
so
deep
in
your
boots
that
you
could
not
take
a
message
for
me
what
is
it
said
ulenspiegel
i
would
have
you
leave
me
here
said
the
dame
and
go
to
koolkercke
from
whence
this
wind
is
blowing
there
you
will
find
a
gentleman
dressed
in
black
and
red
motley
tell
him
that
he
must
not
expect
me
but
let
him
come
evening
to
my
château
by
the
postern
gate
at
ten
o
the
clock
i
will
not
go
said
ulenspiegel
why
not
asked
the
lady
i
will
not
go
not
i
ulenspiegel
said
again
what
can
it
be
the
lady
asked
him
what
can
it
be
that
inspires
you
with
this
unyielding
will
you
angry
little
cock
i
will
not
go
ulenspiegel
persisted
but
if
i
gave
you
a
florin
no
said
he
a
ducat
no
a
carolus
no
ulenspiegel
repeated
although
and
this
was
added
with
a
sigh
i
should
rather
see
it
in
my
mother
purse
than
a
the
dame
laughed
then
suddenly
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
my
bag
i
have
lost
my
little
bag
beautiful
it
was
and
rare
made
of
silk
and
sown
with
fine
pearls
it
was
hanging
from
my
belt
when
we
were
at
damme
ulenspiegel
did
not
budge
but
her
attendant
came
up
to
his
lady
madame
said
he
whatever
else
you
do
be
careful
not
to
send
this
young
robber
to
look
for
it
for
so
you
will
certainly
never
see
it
again
who
will
go
then
asked
the
lady
i
will
he
answered
old
as
i
am
and
away
he
went
midday
had
struck
it
was
very
hot
the
silence
was
profound
ulenspiegel
said
not
a
word
but
taking
off
his
new
doublet
he
laid
it
on
the
grass
in
the
shade
of
a
so
that
the
dame
might
sit
down
thereon
without
fear
of
the
damp
he
stood
close
by
heaving
a
sigh
she
looked
up
at
him
and
felt
compassion
on
that
shy
little
figure
and
she
inquired
of
him
if
he
was
not
tired
standing
there
upright
on
his
young
legs
he
did
not
answer
but
slid
gently
down
at
her
side
she
was
desirous
of
resting
him
and
she
drew
his
head
on
to
her
bare
neck
and
there
it
lay
so
willingly
that
she
would
have
thought
it
the
sin
of
cruelty
itself
had
she
bade
him
find
some
other
pillow
after
a
while
the
attendant
came
back
saying
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
the
bag
i
have
found
it
myself
replied
the
lady
for
when
i
dismounted
from
my
horse
there
it
was
hanging
half
open
on
the
stirrup
and
now
this
to
ulenspiegel
show
us
the
way
to
dudzeel
please
and
tell
me
your
name
my
patron
saint
he
replied
is
monsieur
saint
thylbert
a
name
which
means
fleet
of
foot
towards
that
which
is
good
my
second
name
is
claes
and
my
surname
ulenspiegel
but
now
if
you
would
deign
to
look
at
yourself
in
my
mirror
you
would
see
that
in
all
the
land
of
flanders
there
is
not
one
flower
so
dazzling
in
its
beauty
as
is
the
scented
grace
of
you
the
lady
blushed
with
pleasure
and
was
not
angry
with
ulenspiegel
but
soetkin
and
nele
sat
at
home
weeping
together
through
all
this
long
absence
xviii
when
ulenspiegel
returned
from
dudzeel
and
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
town
he
saw
nele
standing
there
leaning
with
her
back
against
the
she
was
picking
the
stones
out
of
a
bunch
of
black
grapes
which
she
munched
one
by
one
and
found
therefrom
doubtless
much
delight
and
refreshment
nevertheless
she
did
not
allow
anything
of
her
enjoyment
to
appear
on
her
countenance
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
annoyed
at
something
tearing
at
the
grapes
angrily
she
looked
indeed
so
sad
and
sorrowful
so
sweetly
unhappy
that
ulenspiegel
felt
overcome
with
that
pity
which
is
almost
love
and
coming
up
to
her
from
behind
he
printed
a
kiss
on
the
nape
of
the
girl
neck
but
all
the
return
she
gave
him
was
a
great
box
on
the
ear
now
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
properly
any
more
he
said
she
burst
into
tears
o
nele
says
he
are
you
going
to
set
up
fountains
at
the
entrance
of
all
the
villages
be
off
with
you
says
she
but
i
ca
go
away
and
leave
you
crying
like
this
my
little
pet
i
am
not
your
little
pet
says
nele
neither
am
i
crying
no
you
are
not
crying
but
there
is
certainly
some
water
coming
out
of
your
eyes
will
you
go
away
she
turned
on
him
no
he
answered
all
the
time
she
was
holding
her
pinafore
in
her
small
trembling
hand
tearing
at
the
stuff
in
little
spasms
of
rage
and
wetting
it
with
her
tears
nele
said
ulenspiegel
when
is
it
going
to
be
fine
again
and
he
smiled
at
her
very
lovingly
why
do
you
ask
me
that
she
said
because
when
it
is
fine
there
is
an
end
of
weeping
answered
ulenspiegel
go
back
to
your
beautiful
lady
of
the
brocaded
gown
she
said
your
jokes
are
good
enough
for
her
then
ulenspiegel
sang
when
i
see
my
love
crying
my
heart
is
torn
when
she
smiles
is
honey
pearls
when
she
weeps
either
way
i
love
her
and
i
draw
a
draught
of
wine
good
wine
from
louvain
and
i
draw
a
draught
of
wine
when
nele
smiles
again
you
villainous
man
she
cried
making
fun
of
me
again
nele
said
ulenspiegel
it
is
true
that
i
am
a
man
but
i
am
not
a
villain
for
our
family
is
of
noble
origin
a
family
of
aldermen
and
it
carries
on
its
shield
three
pint
pots
argent
on
a
ground
bruinbier
but
nele
tell
me
now
is
it
a
fact
that
in
flanders
when
a
man
sows
a
kiss
he
always
reaps
a
box
on
the
ear
i
refuse
to
speak
to
you
said
nele
then
why
open
your
mouth
to
tell
me
so
i
am
angry
she
said
ulenspiegel
slapped
her
on
the
back
very
lightly
with
his
hand
saying
kiss
a
naughty
girl
and
she
will
cuff
you
cuff
her
she
will
cry
come
then
sweet
cry
upon
my
shoulder
since
i
have
cuffed
you
nele
turned
round
he
opened
his
arms
and
she
threw
herself
into
them
you
wo
go
away
any
more
down
there
will
you
tyl
she
asked
him
but
he
did
not
answer
busy
as
he
was
in
pressing
with
his
the
hand
that
trembled
so
pitifully
and
in
drying
with
his
lips
the
hot
tears
that
fell
from
the
eyes
of
nele
like
heavy
drops
of
rain
in
a
storm
xix
these
were
the
days
when
the
noble
city
of
ghent
refused
to
pay
the
tax
which
her
son
the
emperor
charles
was
demanding
of
her
the
fact
was
it
was
impossible
to
pay
for
already
the
city
was
drained
of
money
by
the
act
of
charles
himself
but
it
seemed
that
the
city
was
guilty
of
a
great
crime
and
charles
resolved
to
go
himself
and
exact
punishment
for
to
be
whipped
by
her
own
son
is
above
all
things
painful
to
a
mother
now
although
he
was
his
enemy
francis
was
pleased
to
offer
the
emperor
a
free
passage
through
the
land
of
france
charles
accepted
the
offer
and
instead
of
being
held
as
a
prisoner
he
was
fêted
and
feasted
in
right
royal
fashion
for
this
is
ever
a
sovereign
bond
of
union
between
kings
each
to
aid
the
other
against
their
own
peoples
charles
stayed
a
long
time
at
valenciennes
and
still
gave
no
sign
of
his
wrath
so
that
mother
ghent
began
to
lay
aside
her
fears
believing
that
the
emperor
her
son
was
going
to
forgive
her
seeing
that
she
had
acted
within
her
rights
but
at
length
charles
arrived
under
the
walls
of
the
city
with
horse
together
with
the
duke
of
alba
and
the
prince
of
orange
the
poorer
townsfolk
and
the
small
business
men
wished
to
prevent
this
filial
entry
into
their
city
and
would
have
called
to
arms
men
of
the
city
and
of
the
country
round
but
the
merchants
the
opposed
this
suggestion
being
afraid
of
the
predominance
of
the
people
thus
ghent
could
easily
have
cut
her
son
to
pieces
him
and
his
horse
but
it
seemed
she
loved
him
too
dearly
and
even
the
small
tradesmen
themselves
were
fast
regaining
their
trust
in
him
charles
also
loved
the
city
but
only
for
the
sake
of
his
coffers
that
were
stored
with
her
money
and
which
he
hoped
to
store
up
fuller
yet
having
made
himself
master
of
the
place
he
established
military
posts
everywhere
and
ordered
that
they
should
patrol
the
city
night
and
day
then
in
great
state
he
pronounced
his
sentence
the
chief
merchants
of
the
city
with
cords
round
their
necks
were
to
appear
before
him
as
he
sat
on
his
throne
and
to
make
a
formal
apology
ghent
itself
was
declared
guilty
of
the
most
costly
crimes
of
disloyalty
disregard
of
treaties
disobedience
sedition
conspiracy
and
high
treason
the
emperor
declared
that
all
and
every
privilege
rights
customs
freedoms
and
usages
all
were
to
be
abolished
and
annulled
and
he
stipulated
for
the
future
too
as
though
he
were
god
himself
that
none
of
his
successors
on
coming
to
the
throne
should
ever
observe
any
one
of
these
usages
again
except
only
that
which
was
called
the
caroline
concession
as
granted
by
him
to
the
city
the
abbey
of
bavon
he
razed
to
the
ground
and
in
place
he
erected
a
fortress
whence
he
could
pierce
with
bullets
and
at
his
ease
his
mother
very
heart
like
a
good
son
that
is
in
a
hurry
for
his
inheritance
he
confiscated
all
the
riches
of
ghent
its
revenues
its
houses
its
artillery
and
munitions
of
war
finding
it
still
too
well
guarded
he
destroyed
also
the
red
tower
the
tower
of
the
trou
de
crapaud
the
braampoort
the
steenpoort
the
waalpoort
the
ketelpoort
and
many
another
of
its
gates
all
carved
as
they
were
and
sculptured
like
jewels
in
stone
and
afterwards
when
strangers
came
to
ghent
they
would
ask
of
one
another
can
this
indeed
be
ghent
whose
marvels
were
on
the
lips
of
all
this
city
so
desolated
and
brought
low
and
the
people
of
ghent
would
make
answer
charles
the
emperor
has
been
to
the
city
he
has
ravished
her
sacred
zone
and
so
saying
they
would
be
filled
with
anger
and
with
shame
and
from
the
ruins
of
the
city
gates
did
the
emperor
take
away
the
bricks
wherewith
to
build
his
castle
for
it
was
his
will
that
ghent
should
be
utterly
impoverished
that
thereby
he
might
make
it
impossible
for
her
ever
to
oppose
his
proud
designs
either
by
her
labour
or
her
industry
or
wealth
therefore
he
condemned
her
to
pay
that
share
of
the
tax
of
caroluses
which
she
had
previously
refused
him
and
in
addition
caroluses
down
and
more
every
year
in
perpetuity
moreover
in
earlier
days
the
city
had
lent
him
money
upon
which
he
should
have
paid
interest
at
the
rate
of
pounds
gross
annually
but
he
made
himself
remit
by
force
the
notes
of
credit
and
by
paying
off
his
debt
in
this
way
he
actually
enriched
himself
many
and
many
a
time
had
ghent
cherished
him
and
succoured
him
but
now
he
struck
her
on
the
breast
as
it
were
with
a
dagger
looking
for
blood
since
it
seemed
he
had
not
there
found
milk
enough
last
shame
of
all
he
cast
his
eye
upon
the
bell
that
is
called
roelandt
and
the
man
who
had
sounded
the
alarm
thereon
bidding
all
the
citizens
to
defend
the
rights
of
their
city
him
he
had
bound
and
hung
to
the
clapper
of
the
bell
and
he
had
no
pity
upon
roelandt
the
very
tongue
of
his
mother
the
tongue
whereby
she
spake
to
all
the
land
of
flanders
roelandt
the
proud
bell
that
sings
of
herself
this
song
when
i
ring
there
is
a
fire
when
i
peal
there
is
a
storm
in
the
land
of
flanders
and
thinking
that
his
mother
had
too
loud
a
voice
he
carried
away
her
bell
and
the
people
of
the
country
round
would
say
that
ghent
was
dead
now
that
her
son
had
wrenched
away
her
tongue
with
his
pincers
of
iron
xx
in
those
days
which
were
days
of
spring
fresh
and
clear
when
all
the
earth
is
in
love
soetkin
was
chatting
by
the
open
window
and
claes
humming
a
tune
while
ulenspiegel
was
dressing
up
the
dog
bibulus
schnouffius
in
a
judge
bonnet
the
dog
plied
his
paws
as
though
desirous
of
passing
judgment
upon
some
one
though
in
reality
it
was
simply
his
way
of
trying
to
get
rid
of
his
ungainly
all
at
once
ulenspiegel
shut
the
window
and
ran
back
into
the
room
then
he
jumped
upon
the
chairs
and
the
table
reaching
up
towards
the
ceiling
with
his
hands
soetkin
and
claes
soon
discovered
the
cause
of
this
mad
behaviour
for
there
was
a
tiny
little
bird
chirruping
with
fear
and
cowering
against
a
beam
in
the
recess
of
the
ceiling
and
ulenspiegel
was
trying
to
catch
it
he
had
almost
succeeded
when
claes
spoke
out
briskly
and
asked
him
why
are
you
jumping
about
like
this
to
catch
the
bird
answered
ulenspiegel
and
put
him
in
a
cage
and
feed
him
with
seeds
and
make
him
sing
for
me
meantime
the
bird
crying
in
an
agony
of
terror
flew
back
into
the
room
striking
its
head
against
the
still
ulenspiegel
went
on
trying
to
catch
it
but
suddenly
the
hand
of
claes
came
down
heavily
upon
his
shoulder
catch
the
bird
if
you
can
said
he
put
it
in
a
cage
make
it
sing
for
your
pleasure
but
i
also
will
put
you
in
a
cage
that
is
fastened
with
strong
bars
of
iron
and
i
will
make
you
sing
too
then
you
who
like
nothing
better
than
to
run
about
will
be
able
to
do
so
no
more
and
you
will
be
kept
standing
in
the
shade
when
you
are
chilly
and
in
the
sun
when
you
are
hot
and
one
sunday
we
shall
all
go
out
and
forget
to
give
you
your
food
and
we
shall
not
return
again
till
thursday
and
then
maybe
we
shall
find
our
tyl
all
stiff
and
starved
to
death
soetkin
was
crying
at
this
picture
but
ulenspiegel
started
forward
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
claes
open
the
window
for
the
bird
to
fly
out
he
answered
and
in
fact
the
bird
which
was
a
goldfinch
flew
straight
out
through
the
window
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
mounted
up
into
the
air
like
an
arrow
and
then
alighted
upon
a
neighbouring
smoothing
its
wings
with
its
beak
ruffling
its
plumage
and
all
kinds
of
abuse
did
it
sing
in
its
bird
language
all
directed
against
ulenspiegel
then
claes
said
o
son
of
mine
take
care
that
you
never
take
away
its
liberty
from
either
man
or
beast
for
liberty
is
the
greatest
good
in
the
world
let
every
one
be
free
free
to
go
out
into
the
sun
when
it
is
cold
and
into
the
shade
when
it
is
hot
and
let
god
give
judgment
on
his
sacred
majesty
he
who
not
content
with
denying
freedom
of
belief
to
the
people
of
flanders
has
now
put
all
the
noble
city
of
ghent
into
a
cage
of
slavery
xxi
now
philip
was
married
to
marie
of
portugal
and
with
her
he
acquired
her
lands
for
the
crown
of
spain
and
together
they
had
a
son
don
carlos
he
who
was
afterwards
called
the
mad
and
the
cruel
and
philip
had
no
love
for
his
wife
the
queen
was
she
kept
her
bed
and
by
her
side
were
the
maids
of
honour
the
duchess
of
alba
among
them
oftentimes
did
philip
leave
his
wife
to
go
and
see
the
burning
of
heretics
and
all
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
the
court
did
likewise
and
thus
also
did
the
duchess
of
alba
and
the
other
noble
ladies
whose
duty
it
was
to
watch
by
the
queen
in
her
childbed
now
at
that
time
the
ecclesiastical
judges
had
seized
a
certain
sculptor
of
flanders
a
good
roman
catholic
on
the
following
charge
he
had
been
commissioned
it
seems
by
a
certain
monk
to
carve
a
wooden
statue
of
our
lady
for
a
certain
sum
and
on
the
monk
refusing
to
pay
the
price
which
had
been
agreed
between
them
the
sculptor
had
slashed
at
the
face
of
the
image
with
his
chisel
saying
that
he
would
rather
destroy
his
work
than
let
it
go
at
the
price
of
a
piece
of
dirt
he
was
straightway
denounced
by
the
monk
as
an
iconoclast
tortured
most
piteously
and
condemned
to
be
burnt
alive
during
the
torture
they
had
scalded
the
soles
of
his
feet
so
that
he
cried
out
as
he
passed
along
from
the
prison
to
the
stake
cut
my
feet
off
for
god
sake
cut
my
feet
off
and
philip
hearing
these
cries
from
afar
was
glad
though
smiled
he
never
a
smile
queen
marie
dames
of
honour
all
left
her
wishing
to
be
present
at
the
burning
and
the
last
of
all
to
desert
her
was
the
said
duchess
of
alba
who
hearing
the
cries
of
the
sculptor
could
not
forbear
to
witness
the
spectacle
so
in
the
presence
of
king
philip
and
of
his
lords
princes
counts
equerries
and
ladies
the
sculptor
was
bound
to
the
stake
by
a
long
chain
and
all
round
the
stake
was
a
circle
of
flaming
bundles
of
straw
and
fiery
torches
the
idea
being
that
if
he
wished
the
sculptor
could
be
roasted
very
gently
by
keeping
close
to
the
stake
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
thus
avoiding
the
full
rigour
of
the
fire
and
right
curiously
did
they
watch
him
naked
or
almost
naked
as
he
was
and
trying
to
stiffen
his
resolution
against
the
heat
of
the
fire
meanwhile
queen
marie
was
stricken
with
a
great
thirst
lying
there
alone
on
her
bed
of
childbirth
and
seeing
the
half
of
a
melon
on
a
plate
she
dragged
herself
out
of
bed
and
took
hold
of
the
melon
and
ate
it
all
but
thereafter
the
cold
substance
of
the
melon
made
her
to
sweat
and
to
shiver
and
she
lay
upon
the
floor
unable
to
move
alas
she
cried
would
that
there
were
some
one
to
carry
me
back
into
bed
that
i
might
get
warm
again
then
it
was
that
she
heard
the
cry
of
the
poor
sculptor
cut
off
my
feet
cut
off
my
feet
ah
said
the
queen
is
that
some
dog
or
other
baying
at
my
death
it
was
at
this
very
moment
that
the
sculptor
seeing
around
him
none
but
the
faces
of
spaniards
his
enemies
bethought
him
of
flanders
the
land
of
valorous
men
and
he
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
and
dragging
the
long
chain
behind
him
walked
straight
towards
the
outer
circle
of
the
straw
and
the
flaming
torches
and
standing
upright
there
still
with
his
arms
crossed
this
cried
he
this
is
how
the
men
of
flanders
can
die
in
the
face
of
the
tyrants
of
spain
cut
off
their
feet
not
mine
that
they
may
be
able
no
more
to
run
into
the
way
of
crime
flanders
for
ever
flanders
for
ever
and
the
ladies
clapped
their
hands
crying
him
mercy
for
the
sake
of
his
proud
look
and
he
died
and
queen
marie
shook
all
over
her
body
and
she
cried
out
her
teeth
chattering
together
with
the
chill
of
approaching
death
and
her
arms
and
legs
grew
stiff
and
she
said
put
me
back
into
my
bed
that
i
may
be
warmed
so
she
died
and
thus
it
was
according
to
the
prophecy
of
katheline
the
good
sorceress
that
philip
the
king
sowed
everywhere
he
went
the
seeds
of
death
and
blood
and
tears
xxii
but
ulenspiegel
and
nele
loved
each
other
and
their
love
was
true
it
was
now
the
end
of
april
all
the
trees
were
in
bloom
and
every
plant
was
swollen
with
sap
for
may
was
near
the
month
of
the
peacock
flowered
like
a
bouquet
the
month
that
sends
the
nightingales
singing
aloud
in
the
trees
of
all
the
earth
oftentimes
would
nele
and
ulenspiegel
wander
together
along
the
roads
nele
would
lean
on
the
arm
of
ulenspiegel
and
hang
round
him
with
her
two
hands
ulenspiegel
loved
this
little
game
and
often
did
he
pass
his
arm
about
nele
waist
to
hold
her
the
better
as
he
said
and
she
was
happy
but
spake
not
a
word
softly
along
the
roads
blew
the
wind
wafting
the
scent
from
the
fields
the
sea
boomed
in
the
distance
rocking
lazily
in
the
sun
ulenspiegel
seemed
like
some
youthful
devil
all
pride
and
nele
like
a
little
saint
from
paradise
half
shy
of
her
happiness
she
leant
her
head
against
ulenspiegel
shoulder
and
her
hand
was
in
his
and
as
they
passed
along
he
kissed
her
forehead
and
her
cheek
and
her
sweet
lips
but
still
she
spake
no
word
after
some
hours
they
grew
hot
and
thirsty
and
they
drank
milk
at
the
house
of
a
peasant
and
yet
they
were
not
refreshed
then
they
sat
them
down
on
the
grass
by
the
side
of
the
ditch
and
nele
seemed
pale
and
pensive
and
ulenspiegel
looked
at
her
afraid
that
something
was
amiss
you
are
unhappy
said
she
yes
he
admitted
but
why
she
asked
him
i
know
not
said
he
but
these
and
all
in
flower
this
air
so
warm
that
one
would
say
it
was
charged
with
lightning
these
daisies
that
open
their
blushing
petals
to
the
fields
and
oh
the
hawthorn
there
close
by
us
in
the
hedge
all
white
will
no
one
tell
me
why
it
is
that
i
feel
troubled
and
always
ready
to
die
or
to
go
to
sleep
and
my
heart
beats
so
strangely
when
i
hear
the
birds
awaken
in
the
trees
and
when
i
see
the
swallows
coming
home
then
i
am
fain
to
go
away
beyond
the
sun
and
beyond
the
moon
and
sometimes
i
am
cold
and
then
again
i
am
hot
ah
nele
would
that
i
were
no
longer
a
creature
of
this
low
world
verily
i
would
give
my
life
a
thousand
times
to
her
that
would
love
me
yet
nele
spake
not
at
all
but
smiling
at
her
ease
sat
looking
at
ulenspiegel
xxiii
one
day
of
all
souls
ulenspiegel
went
forth
from
notre
dame
with
certain
other
vagabonds
of
his
own
age
among
them
was
lamme
goedzak
who
seemed
strayed
among
them
like
a
lamb
in
the
midst
of
a
herd
of
wolves
lamme
treated
them
with
drinks
all
round
for
his
mother
as
her
custom
was
on
sundays
and
feast
days
had
given
him
three
patards
so
he
went
with
his
companions
to
the
tavern
in
dem
rooden
schildt
at
the
sign
of
the
red
shield
jan
van
liebeke
kept
the
house
and
he
served
them
with
dobbel
knollaert
from
courtrai
they
began
to
be
warmed
with
the
drink
and
the
talk
turned
on
the
subject
of
prayer
and
ulenspiegel
declared
quite
openly
that
for
his
part
he
thought
that
masses
for
the
dead
did
nobody
any
good
except
the
priests
who
said
them
now
in
that
company
there
was
a
judas
who
went
and
denounced
ulenspiegel
for
a
heretic
and
in
spite
of
the
tears
of
soetkin
and
the
entreaties
of
claes
ulenspiegel
was
seized
and
taken
prisoner
he
remained
shut
up
in
a
cellar
for
the
space
of
a
month
and
three
days
without
seeing
a
soul
the
jailor
himself
consumed
of
the
ration
that
was
given
him
for
food
during
all
this
time
the
authorities
were
informing
themselves
as
to
ulenspiegel
reputation
whether
it
was
good
or
whether
it
was
bad
they
found
that
there
was
not
much
to
be
said
against
him
except
that
he
was
a
lively
sort
of
customer
always
railing
against
his
neighbours
but
they
could
not
find
that
he
had
ever
spoken
evil
of
our
lord
god
or
of
madame
the
virgin
nor
yet
of
the
saints
on
this
account
the
sentence
passed
on
him
was
a
light
one
for
he
might
easily
have
been
condemned
to
have
his
face
branded
with
a
hot
iron
and
to
be
flogged
till
the
blood
flowed
but
in
consideration
of
his
youth
the
judges
merely
sentenced
him
to
walk
in
his
shirt
behind
the
priests
barefoot
and
hatless
and
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
this
he
was
to
do
on
the
feast
of
the
ascension
in
the
first
procession
that
left
the
church
so
it
was
done
and
when
the
procession
was
on
the
point
of
turning
back
ulenspiegel
was
made
to
stop
beneath
the
porch
of
notre
dame
and
there
cry
out
aloud
thanks
be
to
our
lord
jesus
thanks
be
to
the
reverend
priests
sweet
are
their
prayers
unto
the
souls
in
purgatory
nay
they
are
filled
with
every
virtue
of
refreshment
for
each
ave
is
even
as
a
bucket
of
water
poured
upon
the
backs
of
those
who
are
being
punished
and
every
pater
is
a
tubful
and
the
people
heard
him
with
great
devotion
and
not
without
a
smile
on
the
same
proceeding
had
to
be
gone
through
and
ulenspiegel
followed
again
in
the
procession
with
nothing
on
but
his
shirt
and
with
his
head
bare
and
no
shoes
on
his
feet
and
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
on
returning
to
the
church
he
stood
up
in
the
porch
holding
the
candle
most
reverently
in
his
hand
and
then
in
a
high
clear
voice
yet
not
without
sundry
waggish
grimaces
spake
as
follows
if
the
prayers
of
all
good
christians
are
very
comforting
to
the
souls
in
purgatory
how
much
more
so
must
be
those
of
the
dean
of
notre
dame
a
holy
man
and
perfect
in
the
performance
of
every
virtue
verily
his
prayers
assuage
the
flames
of
fire
in
such
wise
that
they
are
transformed
all
of
a
sudden
into
ice
but
yet
be
sure
that
not
an
atom
of
it
goes
to
refresh
the
devils
that
are
in
hell
and
again
the
people
hearkened
to
what
he
said
with
great
devotion
but
some
of
them
smiled
and
the
dean
smiled
too
in
his
grim
ecclesiastical
way
after
that
ulenspiegel
was
condemned
to
banishment
from
the
land
of
flanders
for
the
space
of
three
years
on
condition
that
he
went
to
rome
on
pilgrimage
and
brought
back
with
him
the
papal
absolution
for
this
sentence
claes
had
to
pay
three
florins
but
he
gave
an
extra
florin
to
his
son
and
bought
him
a
pilgrim
habit
ulenspiegel
was
when
he
came
to
say
to
claes
and
soetkin
on
the
day
of
his
departure
he
embraced
them
both
and
his
mother
was
all
in
tears
but
she
accompanied
him
far
on
his
way
and
claes
went
too
and
many
of
the
townsmen
and
townswomen
when
they
were
home
again
claes
said
to
his
wife
good
wife
it
is
very
hard
that
such
a
boy
should
be
condemned
to
this
cruel
punishment
and
all
for
a
few
silly
words
why
you
are
crying
my
man
said
soetkin
truly
you
love
him
more
than
you
like
to
show
yes
you
are
sobbing
now
with
a
man
sobs
sobs
that
are
like
unto
the
tears
of
a
lion
but
he
answered
her
not
as
for
nele
she
had
gone
to
hide
herself
in
the
barn
so
that
none
might
see
that
she
also
wept
for
ulenspiegel
but
she
followed
afar
after
soetkin
and
claes
and
the
other
townsfolk
and
when
she
saw
her
lover
disappearing
in
the
distance
she
ran
after
him
and
threw
herself
on
his
neck
in
italy
you
will
meet
many
beautiful
ladies
she
said
i
do
not
know
about
their
being
beautiful
he
replied
but
fresh
like
thee
no
for
they
are
all
parched
with
the
sun
they
walked
a
long
way
side
by
side
and
ulenspiegel
seemed
thoughtful
muttering
from
time
to
time
i
make
pay
i
make
pay
for
their
masses
for
the
dead
what
masses
are
those
you
speak
of
nele
inquired
and
who
is
to
pay
for
them
ulenspiegel
answered
all
the
deans
curés
clerks
beadles
and
the
rest
both
superior
and
inferior
who
feed
us
with
their
trash
see
now
if
i
had
happened
to
be
a
strong
working
man
they
would
have
robbed
me
of
the
value
of
three
years
labour
by
making
me
thus
to
go
on
this
pilgrimage
but
as
things
are
it
is
the
poor
claes
who
pays
ah
but
they
shall
give
me
back
my
three
years
a
hundredfold
and
with
their
own
money
i
myself
will
sing
for
them
their
masses
for
the
dead
alas
tyl
said
nele
be
prudent
or
they
will
have
you
burnt
alive
i
am
fireproof
answered
ulenspiegel
and
they
parted
from
one
another
she
all
in
tears
he
and
angry
xxiv
once
in
the
open
country
ulenspiegel
shook
himself
like
a
dog
or
like
a
bird
that
has
regained
its
liberty
and
his
heart
was
cheered
by
the
trees
and
fields
and
the
bright
sunshine
when
he
had
walked
on
thus
for
three
days
he
came
to
the
outskirts
of
brussels
and
to
the
wealthy
township
of
uccle
and
there
passing
in
front
of
the
inn
with
the
sign
of
the
trumpet
his
attention
was
drawn
to
a
most
heavenly
odour
of
fricassee
a
little
urchin
who
stood
by
was
also
sniffing
the
delightful
perfume
of
the
sauce
and
ulenspiegel
asked
him
in
whose
honour
it
was
that
there
rose
to
heaven
such
odour
of
festal
incense
the
boy
made
answer
that
the
guild
of
the
jolly
face
was
to
meet
at
the
inn
that
evening
after
vespers
to
celebrate
the
deliverance
of
the
town
by
the
women
and
girls
of
olden
time
now
in
the
distance
ulenspiegel
saw
a
high
pole
with
a
popinjay
on
the
top
of
it
and
the
pole
was
set
in
the
ground
and
round
it
were
a
company
of
women
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
he
asked
the
boy
if
women
were
become
archers
nowadays
the
boy
still
sniffing
greedily
the
savour
of
the
sauces
replied
that
in
the
days
of
the
good
duke
the
very
bows
that
were
now
being
used
by
those
women
had
been
the
means
of
killing
over
a
hundred
brigands
ulenspiegel
desired
to
know
further
concerning
this
matter
but
the
boy
said
that
he
could
tell
no
more
so
hungry
was
he
unless
forsooth
ulenspiegel
would
give
him
a
patard
with
which
he
might
buy
food
and
drink
this
ulenspiegel
did
for
he
felt
sorry
for
him
no
sooner
had
the
boy
received
the
patard
than
he
rushed
into
the
tavern
like
a
fox
to
the
and
presently
reappeared
in
triumph
with
half
a
sausage
and
a
large
loaf
of
bread
and
now
ulenspiegel
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
sweet
sound
of
viols
and
tabors
and
soon
he
saw
a
number
of
women
dancing
together
and
among
them
a
woman
of
great
beauty
with
a
chain
of
gold
hanging
round
her
neck
the
boy
who
had
by
this
time
assuaged
his
hunger
and
was
grinning
with
delight
informed
ulenspiegel
that
the
beautiful
woman
was
the
queen
of
archery
that
her
name
was
mietje
and
that
she
was
wife
to
messire
renonckel
alderman
of
the
parish
then
he
asked
ulenspiegel
to
give
him
six
liards
for
a
drink
ulenspiegel
gave
him
the
money
and
when
he
had
thus
eaten
and
drunk
his
fill
the
urchin
sat
himself
down
in
the
sun
and
fell
to
picking
his
teeth
with
his
nails
when
the
women
archers
noticed
ulenspiegel
standing
there
in
his
pilgrim
habit
they
came
and
began
to
dance
round
him
in
a
ring
crying
hail
pilgrim
hail
do
you
come
from
far
away
you
handsome
pilgrim
boy
ulenspiegel
thinking
sadly
of
nele
thus
made
answer
i
come
from
flanders
a
lovely
land
and
filled
with
lovesome
girls
what
crime
have
you
committed
asked
the
women
stopping
in
their
dance
i
dare
not
confess
it
so
great
it
was
said
he
they
asked
him
the
reason
why
it
was
needful
for
him
to
journey
thus
with
a
pilgrim
staff
and
wallet
and
those
scalloped
oysters
that
are
the
sign
of
the
pilgrim
the
reason
is
he
replied
not
quite
truthfully
that
i
said
that
masses
for
the
dead
are
advantageous
to
the
priests
true
they
bring
many
a
sounding
denier
to
the
priests
they
answered
but
are
they
not
also
of
advantage
to
the
souls
in
purgatory
i
have
never
been
there
answered
ulenspiegel
will
you
come
dine
with
us
said
the
prettiest
of
the
archers
willingly
would
i
dine
with
you
said
he
and
dine
off
you
into
the
bargain
you
and
all
your
companions
in
turn
for
you
are
morsels
fit
for
a
king
more
delicate
to
swallow
than
any
ortolan
or
thrush
or
snipe
nay
they
answered
but
we
are
not
for
sale
then
perhaps
you
will
give
he
asked
them
yea
verily
they
laughed
a
good
box
on
the
ear
to
such
as
are
too
bold
and
if
needs
were
we
would
beat
you
now
like
a
bundle
of
corn
thank
you
he
said
i
will
go
without
the
beating
well
then
they
said
come
in
to
dinner
so
he
followed
them
into
the
inn
yard
glad
for
their
fresh
young
faces
and
thereafter
he
saw
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
themselves
who
were
now
entering
the
yard
with
great
ceremony
and
by
their
own
jolly
appearance
living
up
most
conspicuously
to
the
name
of
their
guild
they
scrutinized
ulenspiegel
with
some
curiosity
till
one
of
the
women
informed
them
who
he
was
a
pilgrim
they
had
picked
up
on
the
road
and
whom
being
a
good
like
unto
their
husbands
and
their
sweethearts
they
had
invited
to
share
in
the
entertainment
the
men
were
agreeable
to
this
proposal
and
one
of
them
addressed
himself
to
ulenspiegel
pilgrim
on
pilgrimage
what
say
you
now
to
continuing
your
pilgrimage
across
some
sauce
and
fricassee
i
shall
have
need
of
my
boots
answered
ulenspiegel
now
as
he
was
following
them
into
the
festal
hall
he
noticed
twelve
blind
men
coming
along
the
paris
road
and
as
they
passed
they
were
lamenting
most
piteously
their
hunger
and
thirst
but
ulenspiegel
said
to
himself
that
they
should
dine
that
night
like
kings
and
all
at
the
expense
of
the
dean
of
uccle
himself
and
in
memory
of
the
masses
for
the
dead
he
accosted
them
saying
here
are
nine
florins
for
you
come
in
to
dinner
do
you
not
smell
the
good
smell
of
fricassee
ah
they
cried
for
the
last
and
without
hope
now
you
can
eat
your
fill
said
ulenspiegel
for
you
have
nine
florins
but
he
had
not
really
given
them
anything
the
lord
bless
you
they
said
for
being
blind
each
man
believed
his
neighbour
had
been
given
the
money
and
shown
the
way
by
ulenspiegel
they
all
sat
down
at
a
small
table
while
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
took
their
seats
at
a
long
one
together
with
their
wives
and
their
daughters
then
with
the
complete
assurance
that
comes
from
the
possession
of
nine
florins
mine
host
cried
the
blind
men
insolently
give
us
now
to
eat
and
to
drink
of
your
best
the
landlord
who
had
heard
tell
of
the
nine
florins
and
thought
that
they
were
safe
in
the
blind
men
purse
asked
them
what
they
would
like
for
their
dinner
then
they
all
began
to
talk
at
once
at
the
top
of
their
voices
bacon
and
peas
hotchpotch
of
beef
and
veal
chicken
and
lamb
and
where
are
the
sausages
were
they
made
for
the
dogs
pray
and
who
is
he
that
has
smelt
out
the
black
and
white
puddings
in
the
passage
without
collaring
them
for
us
i
used
to
be
able
to
see
them
alas
in
the
days
when
my
poor
eyes
were
bright
as
candles
and
where
is
the
buttered
koekebakken
of
anderlecht
sizzling
in
the
juicy
and
crackling
enough
to
make
a
fish
thirsty
for
drink
ho
there
but
who
will
bring
me
eggs
and
ham
or
ham
and
eggs
twin
friends
of
my
palate
and
where
are
you
you
choesels
that
float
in
a
heavenly
mess
of
meats
and
kidneys
coxcombs
sweetbreads
lamb
feet
with
many
onions
pepper
cloves
nutmegs
all
in
a
stew
and
three
pints
at
least
of
best
white
wine
for
sauce
and
who
will
bring
you
to
me
divine
chitterlings
you
that
are
so
good
that
one
does
not
utter
a
word
while
you
are
being
swallowed
and
they
come
straight
from
luyleckerland
a
land
bursting
with
fatness
and
filled
with
happy
lazy
folk
whose
passion
for
good
things
to
eat
is
never
assuaged
and
where
are
you
dried
leaves
of
autumns
past
now
quick
there
bring
me
a
leg
of
mutton
with
broad
beans
and
for
me
some
pig
ears
grilled
with
and
for
me
a
chaplet
of
ortolans
verily
the
snipe
shall
figure
the
paters
and
a
fat
capon
the
credo
mine
host
answered
quietly
i
will
bring
you
an
omelette
made
with
sixty
eggs
and
as
to
guide
your
spoons
i
will
plant
fifty
black
puddings
in
the
midst
all
smoking
on
a
veritable
mountain
of
good
cheer
and
from
the
top
of
all
some
dobbel
peterman
shall
flow
down
like
a
river
on
every
side
at
this
the
mouths
of
the
poor
blind
men
began
to
water
indeed
and
they
said
then
serve
us
pray
and
that
right
quickly
with
the
mountain
the
and
the
river
and
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
who
were
now
all
seated
at
table
with
their
wives
remarked
to
ulenspiegel
that
this
should
be
called
the
day
of
the
invisible
feast
for
that
the
blind
men
could
not
see
what
they
were
eating
and
thus
poor
things
were
deprived
of
half
their
pleasure
at
last
it
came
the
omelette
all
garnished
with
cress
and
parsley
carried
by
mine
host
himself
and
four
of
his
cooks
and
the
blind
men
desired
to
fall
to
incontinently
and
at
once
began
to
set
their
paws
upon
it
but
mine
host
was
determined
to
serve
each
of
them
fairly
and
however
difficult
it
might
be
to
make
sure
that
each
trencher
had
its
just
portion
the
women
archers
were
filled
with
pity
to
see
the
blind
men
gobbling
and
sighing
with
joy
at
what
was
set
before
them
for
in
truth
they
were
half
starved
and
they
swallowed
down
the
puddings
as
though
they
had
been
oysters
and
the
dobbel
peterman
flowed
into
their
stomachs
as
if
it
had
been
a
cataract
falling
down
from
some
lofty
mountain
when
at
length
they
had
cleared
their
trenchers
they
demanded
yet
further
supplies
of
koekebakken
ortolans
and
fricassees
mine
host
however
only
provided
a
great
platter
of
beef
and
veal
and
mutton
bones
all
swimming
in
a
most
goodly
sauce
but
he
did
not
divide
it
properly
so
that
when
they
had
well
dipped
their
bread
in
the
sauce
and
eke
their
hands
right
up
to
the
elbows
yet
drew
not
out
anything
but
bones
of
cutlet
of
veal
or
mutton
each
man
fell
straightway
to
imagining
that
his
neighbour
had
got
hold
of
all
the
meat
and
they
began
to
fight
among
themselves
hitting
out
most
furiously
one
against
another
with
the
bones
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
laughed
heartily
at
this
but
being
charitably
disposed
each
put
a
portion
of
his
own
dinner
into
the
blind
men
platter
so
now
if
one
of
the
blind
went
searching
for
a
new
bone
with
which
to
carry
on
the
fight
he
would
put
his
hand
belike
upon
a
thrush
or
chicken
or
a
lark
or
two
and
all
the
time
the
women
holding
their
heads
well
backwards
kept
pouring
into
the
mouths
of
the
blind
long
draughts
of
brussels
wine
and
when
they
reached
out
with
their
hands
to
feel
as
blind
men
will
whence
came
these
rivulets
of
ambrosia
they
would
catch
oftentimes
at
a
woman
skirt
and
try
to
hold
it
fast
but
quickly
the
skirt
would
make
its
escape
thus
they
laughed
and
drank
ate
and
sang
enjoying
themselves
hugely
some
of
them
when
they
found
that
women
were
present
ran
through
the
hall
all
maddened
with
amorous
desire
but
the
malicious
girls
kept
out
of
their
way
hiding
behind
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
and
one
of
them
would
say
come
kiss
me
and
when
the
blind
victim
tried
to
do
so
he
would
find
himself
kissing
not
a
girl
at
all
but
the
bearded
face
of
a
man
who
would
reward
him
with
a
cuff
on
the
cheek
as
like
as
not
and
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
began
to
sing
and
the
blind
men
sang
also
and
the
merry
women
smiled
with
fond
delight
to
see
their
pleasure
but
when
the
juicy
hours
were
past
it
was
the
turn
of
the
innkeeper
who
came
forward
saying
now
you
have
eaten
your
fill
my
friends
and
drunk
your
fill
you
owe
me
seven
florins
but
each
of
the
blind
men
swore
that
he
had
no
purse
and
asserted
that
it
was
one
of
the
others
who
carried
it
thereat
arose
a
further
dispute
and
they
began
to
hit
out
at
one
another
with
feet
and
hands
and
heads
but
they
mostly
missed
their
mark
striking
out
at
random
while
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
entering
into
the
fun
took
care
to
keep
them
apart
so
that
their
blows
rained
down
upon
the
empty
air
all
save
one
which
happened
unfortunately
to
strike
the
face
of
the
innkeeper
who
straightway
fell
into
a
rage
and
ransacked
all
their
pockets
but
he
found
there
nothing
but
an
old
scapular
seven
liards
three
and
a
few
rosaries
at
last
he
threatened
to
throw
the
whole
lot
of
them
into
the
and
leave
them
there
with
nothing
but
bread
and
water
to
eat
till
they
paid
what
they
owed
let
me
go
surety
for
them
said
ulenspiegel
certainly
answered
the
innkeeper
if
some
one
will
also
go
surety
for
you
this
the
brethren
of
the
jolly
face
at
once
offered
to
do
but
ulenspiegel
refused
them
no
he
said
the
dean
of
uccle
shall
be
my
surety
i
will
go
and
find
him
to
be
sure
it
was
those
masses
for
the
dead
that
he
was
thinking
of
and
when
he
had
found
the
dean
he
told
him
a
story
of
how
the
innkeeper
of
the
trumpet
inn
was
possessed
by
the
devil
and
how
he
could
talk
of
nothing
but
pigs
and
blind
men
something
or
other
about
pigs
eating
the
blind
and
the
blind
eating
the
pigs
under
various
infamous
forms
of
roast
meats
and
fricassees
while
these
attacks
were
on
the
innkeeper
so
ulenspiegel
affirmed
would
break
up
all
the
furniture
in
the
inn
and
he
begged
the
dean
to
come
and
deliver
the
poor
man
from
the
wicked
devil
that
possessed
him
the
dean
promised
to
do
so
but
he
said
he
could
not
come
at
the
moment
for
he
was
busy
with
the
accounts
of
the
chapter
trying
to
make
something
out
of
them
for
himself
seeing
that
the
dean
was
growing
impatient
ulenspiegel
said
that
he
would
return
and
bring
with
him
the
innkeeper
wife
in
order
that
the
dean
might
speak
to
her
himself
very
well
said
the
dean
so
ulenspiegel
came
again
to
the
innkeeper
and
said
to
him
i
have
just
seen
the
dean
and
he
is
willing
to
go
surety
for
the
blind
men
do
you
keep
watch
over
them
and
let
your
wife
come
with
me
and
the
dean
will
repeat
to
her
what
i
have
just
told
you
go
wife
said
the
innkeeper
so
the
innkeeper
wife
went
with
ulenspiegel
to
the
dean
who
was
still
at
his
accounts
and
busy
with
the
same
problem
when
therefore
he
saw
ulenspiegel
and
the
woman
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
that
they
should
withdraw
saying
at
the
same
time
it
is
all
right
i
will
come
to
the
help
of
your
husband
in
a
day
or
two
and
ulenspiegel
went
back
to
the
inn
and
said
to
himself
seven
florins
shall
he
pay
seven
florins
and
that
shall
be
the
first
of
my
masses
for
the
dead
and
ulenspiegel
departed
from
that
place
and
the
blind
men
likewise
xxv
now
in
those
days
katheline
had
effected
a
cure
by
means
of
herbs
on
three
sheep
an
ox
and
a
pig
all
belonging
to
a
certain
man
named
speelman
she
also
attempted
to
cure
a
cow
the
property
of
one
jan
beloen
but
in
this
she
was
not
successful
jan
beloen
promptly
accused
her
of
being
a
witch
asserting
that
she
had
laid
a
charm
on
the
animal
inasmuch
as
all
the
time
she
was
giving
the
herbs
she
had
caressed
it
and
talked
to
it
in
the
devil
own
language
as
was
evident
for
what
business
has
an
honest
christian
woman
to
go
talking
with
an
animal
jan
beloen
added
that
he
was
a
neighbour
of
speelman
the
man
whose
ox
had
been
cured
together
with
three
sheep
and
a
pig
as
aforesaid
and
if
katheline
had
now
killed
his
cow
it
was
doubtless
at
the
instigation
of
speelman
who
was
jealous
at
seeing
his
beloen
land
better
and
more
profitably
cultivated
than
his
own
pieter
meulmeester
a
man
of
good
life
and
reputation
and
jan
beloen
himself
both
testified
that
katheline
was
commonly
reputed
to
be
a
witch
by
the
people
of
damme
and
that
she
had
certainly
killed
the
cow
and
on
this
testimony
katheline
was
arrested
and
condemned
to
be
tortured
until
she
had
confessed
her
crimes
and
malpractices
she
was
by
a
certain
alderman
who
was
notorious
for
his
for
he
was
accustomed
to
drink
brandy
all
the
day
long
and
he
ordered
her
to
be
placed
on
the
seat
of
torture
in
the
presence
of
himself
and
the
members
of
the
town
council
the
torturer
put
her
on
the
seat
stark
naked
and
then
shaved
off
her
hair
looking
carefully
to
see
that
no
charm
was
concealed
anywhere
about
her
person
finding
none
he
bound
her
with
cords
to
the
seat
of
torture
and
she
said
it
shames
me
to
be
naked
before
these
men
o
mother
mary
let
me
die
the
torturer
then
wrapped
some
damp
cloths
round
her
breast
and
body
and
legs
and
raising
the
bench
upright
he
proceeded
to
pour
great
quantities
of
hot
water
down
her
throat
so
that
her
stomach
became
all
swollen
then
he
let
the
bench
down
again
the
alderman
asked
katheline
if
she
would
now
acknowledge
her
crime
she
made
a
sign
in
the
negative
and
the
torturer
poured
more
hot
water
into
her
but
this
katheline
brought
all
up
again
then
by
the
advice
of
the
doctor
she
was
released
but
she
did
not
speak
a
word
only
beat
her
breast
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
hot
water
had
burned
her
when
the
torturer
saw
that
she
was
recovered
from
this
first
ordeal
he
said
to
her
confess
that
you
are
a
witch
and
that
you
laid
a
charm
on
the
cow
i
will
confess
no
such
thing
replied
katheline
i
am
here
in
your
power
nevertheless
i
tell
you
that
an
animal
can
die
of
an
illness
just
as
a
man
can
and
in
spite
of
all
the
help
of
surgeons
and
of
doctors
and
i
swear
by
our
lord
christ
who
was
pleased
to
die
upon
the
cross
for
our
sins
that
i
wished
to
do
no
harm
to
this
cow
but
simply
to
cure
her
by
remedies
thereat
the
alderman
was
angry
and
cried
out
this
devil
drab
she
can
not
go
on
lying
for
ever
put
her
to
the
second
torture
then
he
drank
a
large
glass
of
brandy
the
torturer
meanwhile
sat
katheline
down
on
the
lid
of
an
oak
coffin
which
was
placed
on
trestles
now
the
was
pointed
like
a
roof
and
the
edge
of
it
was
as
sharp
as
a
sword
a
great
fire
was
burning
in
the
fireplace
for
it
was
the
month
of
november
katheline
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
had
her
feet
shod
in
shoes
of
new
leather
several
sizes
too
small
for
her
and
then
she
was
placed
in
front
of
the
fire
when
she
began
to
feel
the
sharp
wood
of
the
cutting
into
her
flesh
and
when
her
shoes
began
to
shrink
under
the
heat
of
the
fire
katheline
cried
aloud
oh
agony
will
no
one
give
me
a
draught
of
black
poison
put
her
nearer
the
fire
said
the
alderman
then
he
inquired
of
her
how
often
pray
have
you
ridden
on
a
broom
to
the
sabbath
and
how
many
times
have
you
caused
the
corn
to
wither
in
the
ear
and
the
fruit
on
the
tree
and
the
babe
in
the
womb
of
its
mother
and
turned
most
loving
brothers
into
sworn
enemies
and
sisters
into
rivals
full
of
hatred
katheline
would
have
answered
if
she
had
been
able
but
she
could
only
move
her
arms
as
if
to
say
no
but
the
alderman
said
i
see
she
will
not
speak
till
she
has
felt
her
witch
fat
all
melting
in
the
fire
put
her
nearer
katheline
cried
out
but
the
alderman
said
you
had
better
ask
satan
your
friend
to
refresh
you
and
now
her
shoes
were
beginning
to
smoke
in
the
heat
of
the
fire
so
that
she
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
try
and
take
them
off
ask
satan
to
help
you
said
the
alderman
ten
struck
it
was
the
madman
dinner
hour
and
he
retired
with
the
torturer
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
leaving
katheline
alone
in
front
of
the
fire
in
the
place
of
torture
an
hour
later
they
returned
katheline
was
still
sitting
there
stiff
and
motionless
the
clerk
said
i
think
she
is
dead
the
alderman
commanded
the
torturer
to
remove
katheline
from
the
and
to
take
off
the
shoes
from
her
feet
this
he
could
not
do
so
that
he
was
forced
to
cut
them
and
katheline
feet
were
exposed
to
view
all
red
and
bleeding
the
alderman
whose
thoughts
were
still
with
his
dinner
gazed
at
her
without
a
word
but
after
a
while
she
came
to
her
senses
and
fell
upon
the
ground
nor
was
she
able
to
get
up
again
in
spite
of
many
attempts
then
she
said
to
the
alderman
once
you
desired
me
for
your
wife
but
now
you
shall
have
none
of
me
four
times
three
is
the
sacred
number
and
my
husband
is
the
thirteenth
the
alderman
was
going
to
answer
her
but
she
forestalled
him
be
silent
his
hearing
is
more
delicate
than
that
of
the
archangel
in
heaven
who
counts
the
of
the
just
why
are
you
so
late
four
times
three
is
the
sacred
number
he
killeth
those
who
hold
me
in
desire
the
alderman
said
it
seems
she
welcomes
the
devil
to
her
bed
the
pains
of
the
torture
have
turned
her
brain
said
the
clerk
so
katheline
was
taken
back
into
prison
and
three
days
later
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
aldermen
in
the
council
hall
and
after
some
deliberation
katheline
was
condemned
to
suffer
the
ordeal
by
fire
she
was
taken
to
the
grand
market
of
damme
by
the
torturer
and
his
assistants
there
she
was
made
to
mount
the
scaffold
in
the
square
were
assembled
the
provost
the
herald
and
the
judges
the
herald
sounded
his
trumpet
thrice
then
turned
towards
the
crowd
and
made
the
following
announcement
the
council
of
damme
he
cried
having
taken
pity
upon
the
woman
katheline
have
decreed
that
punishment
shall
not
be
exacted
to
the
full
extremity
of
the
rigour
of
our
laws
nevertheless
in
witness
that
she
is
a
sorceress
her
hair
shall
be
burned
she
shall
pay
a
fine
of
twenty
carolus
and
she
shall
be
banished
from
the
territory
of
damme
for
the
space
of
three
years
under
penalty
of
losing
one
of
her
limbs
and
at
this
rough
gentleness
the
people
broke
into
applause
then
the
torturer
tied
katheline
to
the
stake
placed
on
her
shorn
scalp
a
wig
of
tow
and
held
it
in
the
fire
and
the
tow
burned
for
a
long
time
and
katheline
cried
aloud
and
wept
then
they
released
her
and
she
was
put
in
a
cart
and
taken
away
outside
the
territory
of
damme
she
could
not
walk
at
all
because
of
her
feet
that
were
burned
xxvi
ulenspiegel
meanwhile
had
arrived
in
his
wanderings
at
the
at
liége
there
he
descried
a
tall
young
fellow
carrying
under
his
arm
a
net
filled
with
all
sorts
of
poultry
and
another
net
also
which
he
was
rapidly
filling
with
haddock
trout
eels
and
pike
ulenspiegel
recognized
him
as
none
other
than
his
old
friend
lamme
goedzak
what
are
you
doing
here
lamme
he
said
you
must
know
lamme
answered
that
many
people
have
lately
emigrated
from
flanders
to
this
gentle
land
of
liége
as
for
me
i
follow
my
loves
and
you
i
am
on
the
for
a
master
to
serve
for
my
daily
bread
said
ulenspiegel
bread
is
a
dry
sort
of
nourishment
said
lamme
you
would
do
better
to
try
a
chaplet
of
ortolans
with
a
thrush
for
the
credo
you
have
plenty
of
money
ulenspiegel
inquired
lamme
goedzak
made
answer
i
have
lost
my
father
and
mother
and
that
young
sister
of
mine
that
used
to
beat
me
so
i
shall
inherit
all
their
property
and
now
i
am
living
with
a
servant
who
is
very
learned
in
the
noble
art
of
making
fricassees
would
you
like
me
to
carry
your
fish
and
your
poultry
for
you
suggested
ulenspiegel
yes
said
lamme
and
together
they
began
to
wander
through
the
market
all
at
once
lamme
said
to
his
companion
you
are
mad
do
you
know
why
no
said
ulenspiegel
because
you
go
carrying
fish
and
poultry
in
your
hand
instead
of
in
your
stomach
you
are
right
lamme
said
ulenspiegel
but
since
i
have
lacked
bread
ortolans
will
not
even
look
at
me
you
shall
eat
your
fill
of
them
said
lamme
and
serve
me
too
if
my
cook
takes
a
fancy
to
you
while
they
were
walking
along
lamme
pointed
out
to
ulenspiegel
a
beautiful
young
girl
who
was
walking
through
the
market
she
wore
a
silk
dress
and
gazed
at
lamme
with
sweet
and
gentle
eyes
an
old
man
her
father
walked
just
behind
carrying
two
nets
one
filled
with
fish
the
other
with
game
see
that
girl
said
lamme
pointing
at
her
i
am
going
to
marry
her
oh
said
ulenspiegel
i
know
her
she
is
a
flemish
maid
from
zotteghem
she
lives
in
the
rue
and
the
neighbours
say
that
she
lets
her
mother
sweep
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
in
her
stead
while
her
own
father
irons
her
underclothing
to
this
lamme
made
no
answer
but
exclaimed
delightedly
she
looked
at
me
just
now
by
this
time
they
were
come
to
lamme
lodging
near
the
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
servant
opened
to
them
ulenspiegel
saw
that
she
was
old
scraggy
lank
and
fierce
of
aspect
lamme
addressed
her
as
la
sanginne
and
inquired
if
she
would
take
ulenspiegel
to
help
in
the
kitchen
i
will
give
him
a
trial
she
said
then
take
him
said
lamme
and
let
him
also
make
trial
of
the
delights
of
your
kitchen
la
sanginne
put
three
black
puddings
on
the
table
a
pint
of
ale
and
a
large
loaf
of
bread
ulenspiegel
set
to
with
a
will
and
lamme
began
to
nibble
at
one
of
the
puddings
know
you
lamme
asked
presently
where
it
is
that
our
souls
abide
no
lamme
said
ulenspiegel
in
our
stomachs
lamme
told
him
so
they
can
keep
them
excavated
continually
and
for
ever
renew
in
our
bodies
the
impulse
for
life
and
who
are
the
best
companions
for
a
man
i
tell
you
the
best
companions
for
a
man
are
all
good
and
jolly
things
to
eat
and
wine
from
the
meuse
to
crown
all
true
said
ulenspiegel
a
pudding
is
good
company
to
a
solitary
soul
he
still
hungry
said
lamme
to
la
sanginne
give
him
some
more
and
the
woman
served
him
with
a
second
portion
of
pudding
white
this
time
while
ulenspiegel
went
on
eating
lamme
grew
thoughtful
when
i
die
said
he
my
stomach
will
die
with
me
and
down
there
in
purgatory
they
will
leave
me
to
fast
and
i
shall
have
to
carry
my
poor
belly
about
with
me
all
empty
and
limp
i
like
the
black
ones
best
said
ulenspiegel
you
have
eaten
six
already
said
la
sanginne
and
you
wo
have
any
more
you
may
be
sure
said
lamme
that
you
will
be
well
treated
here
and
you
will
have
just
the
same
to
eat
as
i
do
i
shall
remember
this
promise
of
yours
said
ulenspiegel
but
seeing
that
what
his
friend
had
told
him
was
the
truth
ulenspiegel
was
well
content
and
the
puddings
that
he
had
swallowed
gave
him
such
courage
that
on
that
very
day
he
polished
the
kettles
and
the
pots
and
the
pans
till
they
shone
like
the
sun
and
he
lived
happily
in
that
house
frequenting
willingly
the
kitchen
and
the
and
leaving
the
loft
to
the
cats
one
day
la
sanginne
had
two
poulets
to
roast
and
she
asked
ulenspiegel
to
turn
the
spit
while
she
went
to
market
for
some
herbs
for
a
seasoning
the
two
poulets
being
well
roasted
ulenspiegel
took
one
of
them
and
ate
it
when
la
sanginne
returned
from
the
market
she
remarked
there
were
two
poulets
but
now
i
can
only
see
one
just
open
your
other
eye
answered
ulenspiegel
and
you
will
see
the
two
of
them
all
right
but
she
was
angry
and
went
to
lamme
goedzak
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
lamme
came
down
into
the
kitchen
and
said
to
ulenspiegel
why
do
you
make
fun
of
my
there
were
certainly
two
poulets
there
were
said
ulenspiegel
but
when
i
came
you
told
me
that
i
was
to
eat
and
drink
just
as
much
as
you
there
were
two
poulets
very
well
i
have
eaten
one
and
you
will
eat
the
other
my
pleasure
is
over
yours
is
still
to
come
are
you
not
happier
than
i
yes
said
lamme
smiling
but
just
you
do
what
la
sanginne
tells
you
and
you
find
your
work
halved
i
will
be
careful
to
do
as
you
say
said
ulenspiegel
so
every
time
that
la
sanginne
told
him
to
do
anything
he
did
but
the
half
of
it
if
she
asked
him
to
go
and
draw
two
pails
of
water
he
would
only
bring
back
one
and
if
she
told
him
to
go
and
fill
a
pot
of
ale
at
the
cask
he
would
pour
the
half
of
it
down
his
throat
on
the
way
and
so
on
and
so
on
at
last
la
sanginne
grew
tired
of
these
goings
on
and
she
told
lamme
that
either
this
fellow
must
leave
the
house
or
she
must
leave
herself
lamme
descended
on
ulenspiegel
and
told
him
you
have
to
go
my
son
notwithstanding
that
you
have
looked
so
much
better
in
health
since
you
have
been
here
listen
to
that
cock
crowing
and
it
two
of
the
afternoon
that
means
rain
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
put
you
out
of
doors
in
bad
weather
but
there
my
son
you
know
that
la
sanginne
is
the
guardian
angel
of
my
life
with
her
lovely
fricassees
if
she
were
to
leave
me
i
might
die
a
speedy
death
i
can
not
risk
it
go
then
my
boy
and
god
be
with
you
and
here
are
three
florins
and
this
string
of
saveloys
to
liven
your
journey
and
ulenspiegel
departed
crestfallen
and
with
many
regrets
for
lamme
and
his
kitchen
xxvii
there
was
a
rumour
abroad
that
the
emperor
charles
was
going
to
annul
the
right
of
the
monks
to
inherit
the
estates
of
those
who
happened
to
die
in
their
convents
a
thing
which
was
very
displeasing
to
the
pope
one
day
when
ulenspiegel
was
come
to
fish
from
the
banks
of
the
river
meuse
he
was
thinking
to
himself
that
by
the
above
action
the
emperor
would
stand
to
profit
both
ways
since
he
would
inherit
the
said
estates
while
the
family
of
the
deceased
would
inherit
nothing
at
all
pondering
these
thoughts
he
carefully
baited
his
hook
and
then
sat
down
by
the
and
he
began
to
nibble
at
a
piece
of
stale
brown
bread
regretting
the
while
that
he
had
no
good
romagna
wine
wherewith
to
wash
it
down
still
he
thought
one
can
not
always
have
everything
just
as
one
would
like
and
all
the
time
he
kept
on
throwing
little
pieces
of
his
bread
into
the
water
saying
to
himself
that
no
man
deserves
a
meal
who
will
not
share
it
with
his
neighbours
now
it
was
that
a
gudgeon
came
upon
the
scene
attracted
in
the
first
place
by
the
odour
of
and
he
licked
up
the
bread
with
his
lips
and
opened
his
mouth
for
more
thinking
no
doubt
in
his
innocence
that
the
bread
would
fall
into
his
gullet
of
itself
but
while
gazing
thus
in
the
air
the
gudgeon
was
suddenly
swallowed
up
by
a
treacherous
pike
who
had
hurled
himself
upon
him
like
a
flash
of
lightning
now
the
pike
played
a
similar
trick
upon
a
carp
who
was
catching
flies
on
the
top
of
the
water
without
any
fear
of
danger
and
after
this
good
meal
the
pike
stayed
motionless
below
the
surface
of
the
water
disdainful
of
the
smaller
fry
who
indeed
were
only
too
glad
to
swim
away
from
him
of
their
own
accord
and
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
but
while
the
pike
was
taking
his
ease
in
this
manner
a
second
pike
came
up
and
he
was
a
hungry
pike
and
his
mouth
was
open
wide
for
as
yet
he
had
not
breakfasted
with
a
bound
the
new
arrival
threw
himself
upon
his
brother
and
a
furious
combat
ensued
they
lashed
at
one
another
with
their
fins
the
water
was
red
with
their
blood
the
pike
that
had
eaten
defended
himself
but
feebly
against
the
assaults
of
the
hungry
one
nevertheless
backing
a
little
he
took
courage
again
and
threw
himself
like
a
bullet
against
his
adversary
the
latter
awaited
this
new
attack
with
open
jaws
which
did
not
close
until
more
than
half
of
his
assailant
head
had
disappeared
between
them
now
they
tried
to
free
themselves
but
could
not
because
of
the
hooked
teeth
of
the
one
that
had
become
embedded
in
the
flesh
of
the
other
and
so
they
battled
against
each
other
in
despair
nor
did
they
notice
interlocked
as
they
were
the
strong
at
the
end
of
a
silken
cord
which
rose
towards
them
from
the
depths
of
the
water
in
another
moment
it
had
embedded
itself
in
the
body
of
the
pike
that
had
dined
and
the
two
struggling
fish
found
themselves
drawn
out
of
the
water
and
laid
together
on
the
grass
without
the
least
deference
as
he
killed
them
ulenspiegel
said
ha
ha
my
little
pikes
i
will
call
you
the
pope
and
the
emperor
that
prey
ever
one
upon
the
other
but
i
forsooth
am
the
common
man
that
shall
catch
you
on
his
hook
in
god
good
time
and
make
an
end
of
your
battles
xxviii
in
the
meantime
nele
was
taking
care
of
katheline
who
was
still
out
of
her
mind
and
who
called
continually
upon
hanske
her
lover
but
sometimes
nele
would
leave
her
mother
safely
guarded
in
the
house
of
some
kindly
neighbour
and
herself
would
wander
far
and
wide
and
all
alone
even
unto
antwerp
searching
ever
among
the
ships
on
the
river
or
along
the
dusty
roads
for
ulenspiegel
and
at
home
also
in
the
house
of
claes
it
was
evil
days
claes
worked
sadly
on
his
land
alone
for
there
was
not
enough
work
for
two
and
soetkin
stayed
in
the
cottage
by
herself
cooking
the
beans
which
formed
their
daily
fare
in
a
hundred
different
ways
so
that
she
might
have
something
to
enliven
her
husband
appetite
and
she
sang
and
laughed
all
the
time
so
that
he
might
not
be
grieved
by
seeing
her
unhappy
one
day
a
man
on
horseback
drew
up
in
front
of
the
cottage
he
was
dressed
all
in
black
he
was
very
thin
and
very
sad
of
countenance
is
any
one
within
he
asked
god
bless
your
sadness
answered
soetkin
but
am
i
a
phantom
that
seeing
me
here
you
must
yet
inquire
if
there
is
any
one
within
where
is
your
father
asked
the
horseman
if
my
father
name
is
claes
he
is
over
there
soetkin
told
him
you
will
find
him
sowing
corn
the
horseman
departed
in
the
direction
in
which
she
had
pointed
and
soetkin
also
went
her
way
ruefully
for
this
was
the
sixth
time
that
she
had
had
to
go
to
the
baker
to
buy
bread
with
no
money
to
pay
for
it
on
returning
to
the
cottage
soetkin
was
amazed
to
see
claes
coming
down
the
road
triumphantly
seated
on
the
horse
of
the
man
in
black
he
looked
very
proud
of
himself
and
the
man
in
black
walked
by
his
side
holding
the
horse
bridle
hanging
at
his
side
claes
held
a
leathern
bag
which
appeared
to
be
full
of
things
dismounting
from
the
horse
claes
embraced
his
companion
gave
him
a
playful
pat
upon
the
back
and
then
shaking
the
bag
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
long
life
to
josse
my
brother
the
good
hermit
of
meyborg
may
god
keep
him
in
joy
and
fatness
in
happiness
and
health
our
josse
patron
of
plenty
and
of
all
abundance
and
rich
soups
and
so
saying
he
took
up
the
sack
and
deposited
it
upon
the
table
but
soetkin
said
sadly
my
good
man
we
shall
not
eat
this
day
the
baker
has
refused
to
give
me
any
bread
bread
cried
claes
opening
the
sack
and
letting
a
river
of
golden
coins
roll
out
on
the
table
bread
here
is
bread
and
butter
meat
wine
beer
here
are
hams
pasties
ortolans
fatted
poulets
castrelins
all
just
as
you
might
find
them
in
the
houses
of
the
rich
bread
indeed
here
are
casks
of
beer
and
kegs
of
wine
mad
must
be
the
baker
who
will
refuse
to
give
us
bread
verily
we
will
deal
at
his
shop
no
more
but
my
good
man
said
soetkin
amazed
nay
listen
said
claes
and
make
the
most
of
your
good
fortune
for
these
are
the
facts
katheline
it
seems
has
lately
been
to
meyborg
in
germany
and
nele
with
her
on
a
visit
to
my
eldest
brother
josse
who
dwells
there
as
a
hermit
nele
told
my
brother
how
that
we
were
living
in
poverty
notwithstanding
that
we
work
so
hard
and
now
if
we
are
to
believe
this
good
messenger
and
here
claes
pointed
to
the
black
horseman
josse
has
left
the
holy
roman
religion
and
abandoned
himself
to
the
heresy
of
luther
the
man
in
black
made
answer
it
is
they
that
are
heretics
they
who
follow
the
cult
of
the
scarlet
woman
for
the
pope
is
a
cheat
and
a
trader
in
holy
things
oh
cried
soetkin
speak
not
so
loud
sir
you
will
have
us
burned
alive
all
three
well
continued
claes
it
appears
that
josse
has
made
known
to
this
good
messenger
that
inasmuch
as
he
is
going
to
fight
in
the
army
of
frederic
of
saxony
and
is
bringing
him
fifty
armed
men
fully
equipped
he
has
no
need
of
much
money
to
leave
it
to
the
hands
of
some
wretch
of
a
landsknecht
now
that
he
himself
is
going
to
the
war
therefore
says
he
take
it
to
my
brother
claes
and
render
to
him
with
my
blessing
these
seven
hundred
florins
tell
him
to
live
virtuously
and
to
ponder
the
salvation
of
his
soul
yea
verily
said
the
horseman
now
is
the
time
for
god
will
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works
and
every
man
according
to
his
merit
good
sir
said
claes
it
is
not
forbidden
i
trust
to
rejoice
in
the
meantime
at
this
good
news
deign
then
to
stay
with
us
and
we
will
celebrate
our
fortune
with
a
nice
dinner
of
tripe
well
boiled
and
a
knuckle
of
that
ham
which
i
saw
just
now
at
the
of
a
truth
it
looked
so
plump
and
tasty
that
my
teeth
almost
shot
out
of
my
mouth
to
close
thereon
alas
said
the
stranger
the
foolish
make
merry
while
the
eye
of
the
lord
is
yet
upon
them
come
now
messenger
said
claes
will
you
eat
and
drink
with
us
or
will
you
not
the
man
answered
it
will
be
time
enough
for
the
faithful
to
think
about
such
earthly
joys
when
mighty
babylon
has
fallen
seeing
claes
and
soetkin
cross
themselves
he
made
as
though
to
leave
them
but
claes
said
to
him
since
you
persist
in
leaving
us
without
accepting
of
our
hospitality
will
you
at
least
give
to
my
brother
the
kiss
of
peace
on
my
behalf
and
look
after
him
well
at
the
wars
that
will
i
said
the
man
and
he
departed
from
them
while
soetkin
went
to
make
her
preparations
for
celebrating
their
good
fortune
now
it
was
quickly
noised
abroad
through
the
town
that
claes
that
was
once
so
poor
had
now
become
rich
through
the
generosity
of
his
brother
josse
and
the
dean
of
damme
was
heard
to
say
that
it
was
katheline
no
doubt
who
had
laid
a
charm
on
josse
and
he
said
this
because
claes
although
he
had
received
a
large
sum
of
money
from
his
brother
had
given
not
so
much
as
a
single
vestment
to
notre
dame
but
claes
and
soetkin
were
happy
again
claes
working
in
the
fields
or
looking
after
his
business
of
while
soetkin
attended
to
her
home
right
valiantly
yet
still
was
she
sorrowful
at
heart
scanning
ever
with
her
eyes
the
open
road
if
perchance
she
might
see
her
son
ulenspiegel
returning
back
to
her
and
thus
it
was
these
three
lived
on
and
experienced
the
happiness
which
comes
from
god
while
waiting
for
that
which
was
going
to
come
to
them
from
men
xxix
the
emperor
charles
had
received
a
letter
from
england
from
philip
who
was
now
married
to
the
queen
of
that
country
sir
and
father
the
letter
ran
it
is
matter
of
sore
displeasure
to
me
that
i
should
have
to
live
in
a
country
like
this
where
the
accursed
heretics
swarm
like
fleas
and
worms
and
locusts
fire
and
sword
are
needed
to
remove
them
from
the
trunk
of
that
tree
of
life
which
is
our
holy
mother
the
church
and
as
if
this
were
not
trouble
enough
i
have
also
to
put
up
with
being
regarded
not
as
a
king
but
merely
as
the
husband
of
the
queen
for
in
very
truth
apart
from
her
i
am
destitute
of
all
authority
and
the
english
make
mock
of
me
spreading
broadcast
the
most
shameful
pamphlets
which
assert
that
i
am
being
bribed
by
the
pope
to
afflict
their
country
with
every
kind
of
impious
burning
and
persecution
nor
can
i
discover
who
it
is
that
writes
these
pamphlets
nor
yet
who
prints
them
and
when
i
try
to
raise
from
the
people
some
necessary
contribution
for
in
their
malice
and
wickedness
they
often
leave
me
without
any
money
at
all
they
answer
by
advising
me
in
coarse
lampoons
to
ask
of
satan
in
whose
pay
i
am
parliament
makes
excuses
for
fear
of
my
sting
but
i
can
get
nothing
out
of
them
and
meanwhile
the
walls
of
london
are
covered
with
the
grossest
pictures
representing
me
as
a
parricide
who
is
ready
to
strike
down
your
majesty
for
the
sake
of
my
inheritance
but
well
you
know
my
lord
and
father
that
notwithstanding
all
the
hopes
of
a
legitimate
ambition
i
most
certainly
desire
that
your
majesty
may
enjoy
yet
long
and
glorious
years
of
rule
furthermore
there
are
circulating
through
the
city
certain
engravings
on
copper
which
show
me
torturing
animals
and
laughing
the
while
but
well
you
know
sire
that
if
ever
it
has
happened
to
me
to
taste
this
profane
pleasure
i
have
surely
never
laughed
thereat
but
they
try
to
make
out
that
this
innocent
sport
is
a
sort
of
crime
despite
the
fact
that
animals
have
no
souls
and
although
it
is
assuredly
permitted
to
all
men
especially
if
they
be
of
royal
birth
to
make
use
of
brute
beasts
even
unto
death
for
purposes
of
honest
recreation
but
in
this
land
of
england
the
people
are
so
fond
of
animals
that
they
treat
their
animals
better
than
their
own
servants
the
stables
and
are
kept
like
palaces
and
i
have
known
great
lords
who
pass
the
night
on
the
same
litter
with
their
horse
to
crown
all
my
noble
wife
and
queen
is
barren
and
these
people
have
the
outrageous
effrontery
to
declare
that
i
am
to
blame
and
not
she
who
is
in
other
respects
a
most
jealous
and
intractable
woman
and
amorous
to
excess
sir
and
father
i
pray
daily
that
the
lord
god
may
have
me
in
his
grace
and
i
live
in
hopes
that
another
throne
may
be
given
me
even
though
it
be
with
the
turk
what
time
i
still
await
that
other
glorious
throne
to
which
i
shall
be
one
day
called
by
the
honour
of
being
the
son
of
your
very
glorious
and
victorious
majesty
signed
phle
to
this
letter
the
emperor
made
reply
in
the
following
terms
sir
and
son
you
have
bitter
enemies
i
do
not
dispute
it
but
you
must
try
to
endure
them
without
vexation
in
anticipation
of
the
yet
more
brilliant
crown
that
shall
be
yours
hereafter
i
have
already
made
it
widely
known
that
i
am
determined
to
retire
from
my
lordship
over
the
low
countries
and
other
of
my
dominions
for
i
am
growing
old
and
gouty
and
i
know
that
i
shall
not
long
be
able
to
withstand
king
henry
the
second
of
france
for
fortune
ever
favours
the
young
you
should
remember
also
that
so
long
as
you
are
master
of
england
you
will
be
as
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
our
enemy
france
truly
i
suffered
a
nasty
defeat
at
metz
and
lost
there
near
forty
thousand
men
i
was
compelled
to
retreat
before
the
king
of
saxony
if
god
does
not
soon
see
fit
by
a
stroke
of
his
good
and
divine
will
to
me
in
the
force
and
vigour
of
my
prime
i
am
inclined
sir
and
son
to
quit
my
kingdoms
altogether
and
to
leave
them
to
you
have
patience
therefore
and
do
your
duty
meanwhile
against
the
heretics
sparing
none
of
them
man
woman
girl
or
child
for
i
am
credibly
informed
that
madame
your
queen
has
been
minded
to
treat
them
mercifully
and
this
is
a
great
grief
to
me
your
affectionate
father
signed
charles
xxx
ulenspiegel
had
been
long
upon
the
road
his
feet
were
bleeding
but
in
the
district
of
the
bishopric
of
mayence
he
met
a
wagon
full
of
pilgrims
who
invited
him
to
join
them
and
they
carried
him
with
them
to
rome
when
they
arrived
at
the
city
ulenspiegel
got
down
from
the
wagon
and
straightway
noticed
a
woman
standing
at
the
door
of
an
inn
she
smiled
when
she
saw
him
looking
at
her
taking
this
kindly
humour
of
hers
for
a
good
omen
hostess
says
he
will
you
give
asile
pray
to
a
poor
pilgrim
on
pilgrimage
who
has
carried
his
full
time
and
is
about
to
be
delivered
of
his
sins
we
give
asile
to
all
such
as
pay
us
for
it
said
the
woman
i
have
a
hundred
ducats
in
my
purse
said
ulenspiegel
who
in
fact
had
no
more
than
one
and
i
would
dearly
like
to
spend
the
first
of
them
in
your
pleasant
company
and
over
a
bottle
of
old
roman
wine
wine
is
not
dear
in
these
holy
parts
she
answered
come
in
and
drink
your
fill
it
will
only
cost
you
a
soldo
and
they
twain
drank
together
for
so
long
and
emptied
so
many
bottles
of
wine
and
all
to
the
tune
of
such
pleasant
conversation
that
the
hostess
was
constrained
to
order
her
servant
to
serve
the
customers
in
her
place
while
she
and
ulenspiegel
retired
into
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
inn
a
marble
chamber
cool
as
a
winter
day
where
leaning
her
head
on
her
new
friend
shoulder
she
demanded
of
him
who
he
might
be
and
ulenspiegel
answered
her
i
am
lord
of
geeland
count
of
gavergeëten
baron
of
tuchtendeel
i
was
born
at
damme
in
flanders
and
i
hold
there
for
my
estate
five
and
twenty
acres
of
moonlight
what
land
is
that
whence
you
come
the
hostess
asked
him
drinking
from
ulenspiegel
tankard
it
is
a
misty
land
he
told
her
a
land
of
illusion
where
are
sown
the
seeds
of
false
hopes
and
of
castles
in
the
air
but
you
sweet
hostess
mine
were
born
in
no
such
land
of
moonlight
you
with
your
amber
skin
and
your
eyes
that
shine
like
pearls
for
bright
is
the
sunshine
that
has
coloured
that
browned
gold
of
your
hair
and
it
is
lady
venus
herself
who
without
a
single
pang
of
jealousy
has
formed
your
soft
shoulders
and
your
prancing
breasts
your
rounded
arms
your
delicate
sweet
hands
say
shall
we
sup
together
this
night
fine
pilgrim
that
you
are
from
flanders
says
she
say
why
are
you
come
hither
to
have
a
talk
with
the
pope
said
ulenspiegel
heavens
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
together
and
that
is
something
that
even
myself
a
native
of
the
country
have
never
been
able
to
do
yet
shall
i
said
ulenspiegel
but
know
you
where
the
pope
lives
what
he
is
like
what
are
his
habits
and
his
ways
of
life
i
heard
all
about
him
on
the
way
answered
ulenspiegel
his
name
is
julius
iii
wanton
he
is
and
gay
and
dissolute
a
good
talker
that
never
falters
for
a
clever
repartee
i
have
also
heard
that
he
has
taken
an
extraordinary
fancy
to
a
little
dirty
beggar
of
a
man
a
dark
fellow
and
a
rude
who
used
to
wander
about
with
a
monkey
asking
for
alms
he
came
to
the
pope
and
the
pope
it
seems
has
made
a
cardinal
of
him
and
now
gets
quite
ill
if
a
single
day
passes
without
their
meeting
have
some
more
to
drink
said
the
landlady
and
do
not
speak
so
loud
i
have
also
heard
continued
ulenspiegel
that
one
day
he
swore
like
a
soldier
al
dispetto
di
dio
potta
di
dio
and
all
because
they
did
not
bring
him
the
cold
peacock
that
he
had
ordered
to
be
kept
for
his
supper
and
he
excused
himself
saying
my
master
was
angered
over
an
apple
i
who
am
the
vicar
of
god
can
certainly
swear
an
oath
about
a
pheasant
you
see
my
pet
i
know
the
pope
very
well
and
understand
just
what
sort
of
a
man
he
is
oh
dear
she
said
pray
be
careful
and
do
not
tell
this
to
any
one
else
but
still
and
in
spite
of
all
you
tell
me
i
maintain
that
you
will
not
get
to
see
him
i
shall
said
ulenspiegel
i
will
wager
you
a
hundred
florins
they
are
mine
said
ulenspiegel
the
very
next
day
tired
as
he
was
he
ran
through
all
the
city
and
found
out
that
the
pope
was
to
say
mass
that
morning
at
the
church
of
john
lateran
thither
ulenspiegel
repaired
and
took
up
a
position
as
prominently
in
the
pope
view
as
he
could
and
every
time
that
the
pope
elevated
chalice
or
host
ulenspiegel
turned
his
back
to
the
altar
now
one
of
the
cardinals
was
officiating
with
the
pope
swarthy
of
countenance
he
was
malicious
and
corpulent
and
on
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
monkey
he
reported
ulenspiegel
behaviour
to
the
pope
who
straightway
after
mass
sent
four
soldiers
such
as
one
finds
in
those
warlike
lands
to
seize
the
pilgrim
what
religion
do
you
profess
the
pope
asked
him
most
holy
father
answered
ulenspiegel
my
religion
is
the
same
as
my
landlady
the
pope
had
the
woman
fetched
what
is
your
religion
he
asked
her
the
same
as
your
holiness
she
told
him
that
also
is
mine
said
ulenspiegel
the
pope
asked
him
why
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
holy
sacrament
i
felt
myself
unworthy
to
look
upon
it
face
to
face
he
answered
you
are
a
pilgrim
said
the
pope
yes
answered
ulenspiegel
and
i
am
come
from
flanders
to
beg
remission
of
my
sins
the
pope
absolved
and
blessed
him
and
ulenspiegel
departed
in
the
company
of
his
landlady
who
paid
over
to
him
his
hundred
florins
and
with
this
good
store
of
money
he
departed
from
rome
and
set
out
to
return
again
to
the
land
of
flanders
but
he
had
to
pay
seven
ducats
for
the
certificate
of
his
pardon
all
scribed
upon
parchment
xxxi
in
those
days
there
came
to
damme
two
brothers
of
the
premonstratensian
order
sellers
of
indulgences
and
over
their
monastic
robes
they
wore
beautiful
jackets
bordered
with
lace
when
it
was
fine
they
stood
outside
the
porch
of
the
church
and
under
the
porch
when
it
was
wet
and
there
they
stuck
up
their
tariff
and
this
was
the
scale
of
charges
for
six
liards
a
hundred
indulgence
for
one
patard
two
hundred
years
three
hundred
years
for
half
a
sovereign
four
hundred
years
for
seven
florins
and
so
on
according
to
the
price
indulgences
plenary
or
and
pardons
for
all
the
most
terrible
crimes
and
they
gave
to
their
patrons
in
exchange
for
payment
little
parchment
certificates
on
which
were
written
out
the
number
of
years
of
indulgence
and
below
was
the
following
inscription
who
wants
not
to
be
stewed
roasted
fricasseed
burning
in
hell
for
evermore
indulgences
let
him
buy
pardon
and
forgiveness
for
a
little
money
god
will
return
to
him
and
the
eager
purchasers
came
thronging
round
the
monks
one
of
whom
never
left
off
addressing
his
audience
this
brother
had
a
blooming
countenance
and
displayed
three
chins
at
least
and
a
portentous
belly
all
without
the
least
embarrassment
unhappy
ones
he
cried
fixing
with
his
eye
now
one
now
another
of
the
crowd
unhappy
ones
let
me
show
you
a
picture
behold
you
are
in
hell
the
fire
burns
you
most
cruelly
you
are
boiling
in
that
cauldron
full
of
oil
wherein
are
prepared
the
of
astarte
you
are
nothing
better
than
a
sausage
on
the
of
lucifer
or
a
leg
of
mutton
on
the
spit
of
guilguiroth
biggest
of
all
the
devils
and
first
they
cut
you
up
in
little
pieces
ah
woe
is
me
behold
this
sinner
who
despised
indulgences
behold
this
plate
of
daintiness
is
he
is
he
his
wicked
body
thus
reduced
by
damnation
and
for
sauce
brimstone
and
pitch
and
tar
thus
are
those
poor
sinners
eaten
alive
to
be
born
again
continually
to
their
pain
and
here
in
all
reality
is
the
place
of
tears
and
of
grinding
of
teeth
have
mercy
god
of
mercy
for
now
poor
damned
one
you
are
in
hell
and
you
suffer
unspeakable
woes
and
yet
if
any
there
were
to
subscribe
a
denier
for
you
straightway
one
of
your
hands
would
find
relief
and
let
but
some
other
give
a
half
a
denier
and
your
two
hands
would
be
freed
entirely
from
the
pain
of
the
fire
but
as
for
the
remainder
of
your
body
let
some
one
only
give
a
florin
and
there
falls
the
dew
of
indulgence
over
all
o
freshness
of
delight
and
now
for
ten
days
a
hundred
days
a
thousand
years
maybe
according
as
one
pays
no
more
roast
meat
no
more
no
more
fricassees
for
you
and
even
if
it
is
not
for
yourself
is
there
no
one
else
there
in
the
secret
depths
of
the
fire
no
one
else
for
whom
you
would
wish
to
gain
relief
one
of
your
parents
perhaps
a
dear
wife
or
some
lovely
girl
with
whom
you
have
committed
wilful
sin
and
as
he
spoke
these
words
the
monk
jogged
the
elbow
of
his
brother
that
stood
by
holding
in
his
hands
a
silver
bowl
and
that
brother
lowering
his
eyes
at
this
signal
shook
the
bowl
unctuously
as
if
inviting
contributions
whereat
the
preacher
continued
in
this
wise
or
perhaps
you
have
a
son
or
a
daughter
maybe
in
the
midst
of
this
terrible
fire
or
some
beloved
little
child
hark
how
they
cry
aloud
and
weep
and
call
to
you
by
name
can
you
remain
deaf
to
their
pitiful
voices
you
can
not
even
a
heart
of
ice
must
melt
though
it
cost
you
a
carolus
and
behold
at
the
very
sound
of
the
carolus
as
it
strikes
this
vile
metal
and
here
his
comrade
shook
the
plate
again
a
space
opens
out
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
the
tormented
soul
ascends
to
some
volcano
mouth
where
it
meets
the
air
the
fresh
free
air
where
are
the
pains
of
the
fire
now
for
the
sea
is
close
at
hand
and
straight
into
the
sea
the
soul
plunges
she
swims
on
her
back
on
her
stomach
floats
upon
the
waves
dives
beneath
them
oh
listen
how
she
sings
aloud
in
her
joy
see
how
she
rolls
about
in
the
water
the
very
angels
gaze
down
upon
her
from
heaven
and
are
glad
eagerly
they
await
her
coming
but
not
yet
not
yet
has
she
had
her
fill
of
the
sea
if
she
might
only
turn
into
a
fish
she
knoweth
not
how
there
are
prepared
for
her
up
aloft
sweet
baths
perfumed
and
scented
with
fine
bits
of
floating
therein
all
white
and
fresh
like
bits
of
ice
now
a
shark
appears
she
fears
it
not
at
all
but
clambers
upon
its
back
and
sits
there
all
unnoticed
hoping
he
will
take
her
with
him
down
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
now
she
goes
to
greet
the
little
that
feed
on
waterzoey
from
coral
cauldrons
and
on
freshest
oysters
from
plates
of
and
she
is
welcomed
and
fêted
and
made
much
of
but
still
the
angels
in
heaven
beckon
her
on
high
till
at
last
refreshed
and
happy
you
may
see
her
rise
aloft
singing
like
a
lark
up
to
the
highest
heaven
where
god
sits
in
glory
on
his
throne
there
she
finds
again
all
her
earthly
friends
and
loved
ones
save
only
those
forsooth
that
in
this
life
have
spoken
ill
of
indulgences
and
of
our
holy
mother
church
and
who
burn
now
for
their
sin
upon
the
floor
of
hell
and
so
for
ever
and
for
ever
and
for
ever
to
all
ages
in
an
eternity
but
that
other
soul
now
dear
to
god
refreshes
herself
in
soft
baths
and
crunches
buy
then
my
brothers
buy
your
indulgences
we
sell
them
for
crusats
for
florins
or
for
english
sovereigns
even
copper
coin
is
not
refused
buy
then
buy
this
is
the
holy
mart
and
we
have
indulgences
adapted
to
the
poor
man
purse
as
well
as
to
the
rich
man
only
i
am
sorry
to
say
my
brothers
no
credit
is
allowed
for
to
buy
without
paying
cash
is
a
crime
most
grievous
in
the
eyes
of
our
lord
hereupon
the
monk
who
had
kept
silent
shook
his
platter
and
the
florins
crusats
patards
sols
and
deniers
fell
into
it
as
thick
as
hail
claes
feeling
himself
rich
paid
a
florin
for
an
indulgence
of
ten
thousand
years
and
the
monks
delivered
to
him
a
piece
of
parchment
in
exchange
at
last
seeing
that
there
was
no
one
left
in
damme
but
the
miserly
folk
who
would
not
buy
indulgences
at
any
price
the
two
monks
left
the
village
and
proceeded
on
their
way
to
heyst
xxxii
in
those
days
the
country
round
liége
was
in
a
disturbed
and
dangerous
state
by
reason
of
the
heresy
hunts
and
lamme
goedzak
came
again
to
live
in
damme
he
was
married
now
and
his
wife
followed
him
willingly
because
the
people
of
liége
who
had
a
mocking
nature
used
to
make
fun
of
her
husband
meekness
lamme
often
visited
claes
who
since
coming
into
his
fortune
was
always
to
be
found
at
the
tavern
of
the
blauwe
torre
and
had
even
appropriated
one
of
the
tables
for
himself
and
his
boon
companions
this
table
was
next
to
the
one
where
sat
the
dean
of
the
fishmongers
josse
grypstuiver
by
name
drinking
sparingly
from
his
tankard
for
he
was
a
miser
a
stingy
fellow
who
thought
the
world
of
himself
and
lived
for
the
most
part
on
smoked
herrings
and
thought
more
of
money
than
of
the
safety
of
his
own
soul
now
claes
carried
in
his
pocket
that
piece
of
parchment
whereon
was
inscribed
the
tale
of
his
indulgence
one
evening
claes
was
drinking
at
the
blauwe
torre
in
the
company
of
lamme
goedzak
jan
van
roosebeke
and
matthys
van
assche
josse
grypstuiver
also
being
present
claes
had
been
imbibing
freely
and
jan
roosebeke
was
remonstrating
with
him
saying
that
it
was
sin
to
drink
so
much
but
claes
replied
that
a
pint
too
much
meant
nothing
more
serious
than
an
extra
in
purgatory
besides
said
he
i
have
a
indulgence
in
my
pocket
is
there
any
one
here
that
would
like
a
hundred
years
of
them
i
wonder
so
that
he
may
indulge
his
stomach
without
fear
of
the
consequences
every
one
shouted
at
once
how
much
are
you
selling
them
at
for
a
pint
of
beer
claes
answered
i
will
give
you
one
hundred
days
but
for
a
muske
conyn
you
shall
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
some
of
the
revellers
gave
claes
a
pint
of
beer
others
a
piece
of
ham
and
for
each
and
all
claes
cut
off
a
little
strip
of
his
parchment
it
was
not
claes
forsooth
who
consumed
the
price
of
his
indulgences
but
lamme
goedzak
and
he
gorged
himself
so
that
he
began
to
swell
visibly
and
all
the
time
claes
went
on
distributing
his
merchandise
up
and
down
the
tavern
the
man
grypstuiver
turned
a
sour
face
towards
him
and
asked
if
he
had
an
indulgence
for
ten
days
no
said
claes
that
too
small
a
piece
to
cut
every
one
laughed
and
grypstuiver
ate
his
anger
as
best
he
could
then
claes
went
home
followed
by
lamme
walking
as
if
his
legs
were
made
of
wool
xxxiii
towards
the
end
of
the
third
year
of
her
banishment
katheline
returned
to
her
home
in
damme
and
continually
she
cried
aloud
in
her
madness
fire
fire
my
head
is
on
fire
my
soul
is
knocking
make
a
hole
she
wants
to
get
out
and
if
ever
she
saw
an
ox
or
a
sheep
she
would
run
from
it
as
if
in
terror
and
she
would
sit
on
the
bench
at
the
back
of
her
cottage
under
the
wagging
her
head
and
staring
at
the
people
of
damme
as
they
passed
by
but
she
did
not
recognize
them
and
they
called
her
the
meanwhile
ulenspiegel
went
wandering
along
the
roads
and
pathways
of
the
world
and
one
day
he
met
a
donkey
on
the
highway
harnessed
with
leather
and
studs
of
brass
and
its
head
ornamented
with
tassels
and
plumes
of
scarlet
wool
some
old
women
were
standing
round
the
donkey
in
a
circle
all
talking
at
once
and
telling
each
other
how
that
no
one
could
tame
the
donkey
for
that
he
was
a
terrible
animal
and
had
belonged
to
the
baron
of
raix
who
was
a
magician
and
had
been
burned
alive
for
having
sacrificed
eight
children
to
the
devil
and
he
ran
away
so
fast
said
the
old
women
that
none
could
catch
him
and
without
a
doubt
he
is
under
the
protection
of
satan
for
a
while
ago
he
seemed
tired
resting
by
the
wayside
and
the
village
constables
came
to
seize
him
but
he
suddenly
kicked
out
with
his
hind
legs
and
brayed
in
such
fearful
fashion
that
they
durst
not
to
go
near
him
and
that
was
no
bray
of
an
ass
but
the
bray
of
the
devil
himself
so
the
constables
left
him
to
browse
among
the
thistles
and
passed
no
sentence
upon
him
nor
did
they
burn
him
alive
for
a
sorcerer
as
they
should
have
done
verily
these
men
have
no
courage
notwithstanding
this
brave
talk
the
donkey
had
only
to
prick
up
his
ears
or
flick
his
sides
with
his
tail
to
send
the
women
running
away
from
him
with
cries
of
terror
then
back
they
would
come
chattering
and
jabbering
but
ever
ready
to
be
off
again
if
the
donkey
showed
the
least
sign
of
movement
ulenspiegel
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
sight
ah
said
he
talk
and
curiosity
they
flow
like
an
everlasting
river
from
the
mouths
of
women
and
especially
old
women
for
with
the
young
the
flow
is
less
continuous
by
reason
of
their
amorous
occupations
then
considering
the
donkey
this
said
he
to
himself
is
a
sprightly
ass
without
a
doubt
and
a
good
goer
what
if
i
were
to
take
him
for
my
own
to
ride
or
maybe
sell
him
without
another
word
ulenspiegel
went
and
got
a
feed
of
oats
and
returning
offered
them
to
the
donkey
but
while
he
was
eating
of
those
viands
ulenspiegel
jumped
nimbly
upon
his
back
and
taking
the
reins
turned
him
first
to
the
north
then
to
the
east
and
lastly
to
the
west
then
when
he
had
gone
from
them
a
little
way
he
raised
his
hand
as
if
in
blessing
on
those
aged
dames
but
they
almost
fainting
with
fear
fell
upon
their
knees
before
him
and
that
evening
when
they
met
together
again
the
tale
was
told
of
how
an
angel
with
a
felt
hat
trimmed
with
a
pheasant
feather
had
come
and
blessed
them
and
had
taken
off
the
magician
donkey
by
special
favour
of
god
and
ulenspiegel
astride
of
his
ass
went
his
way
through
the
green
fields
where
the
horse
pranced
about
at
liberty
where
the
cows
and
heifers
grazed
at
their
ease
or
lay
resting
in
the
sunshine
and
he
called
the
ass
jef
at
last
jef
came
to
a
stop
and
began
as
happy
as
could
be
to
make
his
dinner
off
the
thistles
which
grew
in
that
place
in
great
abundance
but
anon
he
shivered
all
over
and
flicked
his
sides
with
his
tail
in
the
hope
of
ridding
himself
of
the
greedy
who
like
himself
were
trying
to
get
their
dinner
not
off
the
thistles
but
off
his
own
flesh
ulenspiegel
who
himself
began
to
feel
the
pangs
of
hunger
grew
very
melancholy
happy
indeed
would
you
be
friend
donkey
with
your
good
dinner
of
fine
thistles
if
there
was
no
one
to
disturb
you
in
your
pleasures
and
to
remind
you
that
you
also
are
mortal
born
that
is
to
say
to
the
endurance
of
all
kinds
of
villainies
thus
did
ulenspiegel
address
his
steed
and
thus
continued
for
even
as
you
have
this
gadfly
of
yours
to
worry
you
so
also
hath
his
holiness
the
pope
a
gadfly
of
his
own
even
master
martin
luther
and
his
sacred
majesty
the
emperor
hath
he
not
my
lord
of
france
for
his
tormentor
francis
first
of
that
name
the
king
with
the
very
long
nose
and
a
sword
that
is
longer
still
and
forsooth
donkey
mine
it
is
certainly
permitted
that
i
also
poor
little
man
wandering
all
alone
may
have
my
gadfly
too
alas
woe
is
me
all
my
pockets
have
holes
in
them
and
by
the
said
apertures
do
all
my
fine
ducats
and
florins
and
daelders
ramble
away
flying
like
a
crowd
of
mice
before
the
mouth
of
the
cat
that
would
devour
them
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
money
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
me
that
am
so
fond
of
money
verily
fortune
is
no
woman
whatever
they
may
say
for
she
loves
none
but
greedy
misers
that
shut
her
up
in
their
coffers
tie
her
up
in
sacks
close
her
down
under
twenty
keys
and
never
let
her
show
herself
at
the
window
by
so
much
as
the
little
tip
of
her
gilded
nose
this
then
is
the
gadfly
that
preys
upon
me
and
makes
me
itch
and
tickles
me
without
ever
so
much
as
raising
a
laugh
but
there
you
are
not
listening
to
me
at
all
friend
donkey
and
you
think
of
nothing
but
your
food
you
gobbling
gobbler
your
long
ears
are
deaf
to
the
cry
of
an
empty
stomach
but
you
shall
listen
to
me
i
insist
and
he
belaboured
the
ass
as
hard
as
he
could
till
the
brute
began
to
bray
come
come
now
that
you
have
given
us
a
song
cried
ulenspiegel
but
the
donkey
would
not
advance
by
more
than
a
single
step
and
seemed
determined
to
go
on
eating
thistles
until
he
had
consumed
all
that
grew
by
the
roadside
and
of
these
there
was
an
abundance
when
ulenspiegel
saw
what
was
happening
he
dismounted
and
cut
off
a
bunch
of
thistles
then
mounting
the
ass
again
he
placed
the
bunch
of
thistles
just
in
front
of
the
animal
nose
and
in
this
way
leading
the
donkey
by
the
nose
he
arrived
before
long
in
the
land
of
the
landgrave
of
hesse
friend
donkey
he
said
as
they
went
along
you
verily
go
running
after
a
bunch
of
thistles
the
meagre
fare
with
which
i
have
provided
you
but
you
leave
behind
the
lovely
road
that
is
filled
with
all
kinds
of
most
delicate
herbs
and
thus
do
all
men
scenting
out
some
of
them
the
bouquet
called
fame
which
fortune
puts
under
their
nose
others
the
bouquet
of
gain
and
yet
others
the
bouquet
that
is
called
love
but
at
the
end
of
the
journey
they
discover
like
you
that
they
have
been
pursuing
things
that
are
of
little
account
and
that
they
have
left
behind
all
that
is
worth
anything
health
and
work
repose
happiness
and
home
in
such
discourse
with
his
donkey
ulenspiegel
came
at
last
to
the
palace
of
the
landgrave
there
two
captains
of
artillery
were
playing
dice
upon
the
steps
of
the
palace
and
one
of
them
a
man
of
gigantic
stature
soon
noticed
ulenspiegel
as
he
approached
modestly
upon
his
ass
gazing
down
upon
them
and
their
game
what
do
you
want
said
the
captain
you
fellow
with
your
starved
pilgrim
face
i
am
extremely
hungry
answered
ulenspiegel
and
if
i
am
a
pilgrim
it
is
against
my
will
and
you
are
hungry
replied
the
captain
go
eat
the
next
gallows
cord
you
come
to
for
such
cords
are
prepared
for
vagabonds
like
you
sir
captain
answered
ulenspiegel
only
give
me
the
fine
golden
cord
you
wear
on
your
hat
and
i
will
go
straightway
and
hang
myself
by
the
teeth
from
that
fat
ham
which
i
see
hanging
over
there
at
the
the
captain
asked
him
where
he
came
from
ulenspiegel
told
him
from
flanders
what
do
you
want
to
show
his
highness
the
landgrave
one
of
my
pictures
for
i
am
a
painter
if
it
is
a
painter
that
you
are
said
the
captain
and
from
flanders
come
in
and
i
will
lead
you
to
my
master
when
he
had
been
brought
before
the
landgrave
ulenspiegel
saluted
thrice
and
again
may
your
highness
deign
said
he
to
excuse
my
presumption
in
daring
to
come
and
lay
before
these
noble
feet
a
picture
i
have
made
for
your
highness
wherein
i
have
had
the
honour
to
portray
our
lady
the
virgin
in
her
royal
attire
and
then
after
a
moment
pause
it
may
be
that
my
picture
may
please
your
highness
he
continued
and
in
that
case
i
am
sufficiently
presumptuous
to
hope
that
i
might
aspire
even
unto
this
fine
chair
of
velvet
where
sat
in
his
lifetime
the
painter
that
is
lately
deceased
and
ever
to
be
regretted
by
your
magnanimity
now
the
picture
which
ulenspiegel
showed
him
was
very
beautiful
and
when
the
landgrave
had
inspected
it
he
told
ulenspiegel
to
sit
down
upon
the
chair
for
that
he
would
certainly
make
him
his
court
painter
and
the
landgrave
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
most
joyously
and
ulenspiegel
sat
down
on
the
chair
of
a
truth
you
are
a
very
talkative
fellow
said
the
landgrave
looking
him
up
and
down
may
it
please
your
lordship
answered
ulenspiegel
jef
my
donkey
has
dined
most
excellently
well
on
thistles
but
as
for
me
i
have
seen
nothing
but
misery
these
three
days
past
and
have
had
nothing
to
nourish
me
but
the
mists
of
expectation
you
shall
soon
have
some
better
fare
than
that
answered
the
landgrave
but
where
is
this
donkey
of
yours
i
left
him
on
the
grande
place
ulenspiegel
said
opposite
the
palace
and
i
should
be
most
obliged
if
he
could
be
given
lodging
for
the
night
some
straw
and
a
little
fodder
the
landgrave
immediately
gave
instructions
to
one
of
his
pages
that
ulenspiegel
donkey
should
be
treated
even
as
his
own
the
hour
for
supper
soon
arrived
and
the
meal
was
like
a
wedding
festival
hot
meats
smoked
in
the
dishes
wine
flowed
like
water
while
ulenspiegel
and
the
landgrave
grew
both
as
red
as
burning
coals
ulenspiegel
also
became
very
merry
but
his
highness
was
somewhat
pensive
even
in
his
cups
our
painter
said
he
suddenly
will
have
to
paint
our
portrait
for
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
a
mortal
prince
to
bequeath
to
his
descendants
the
memory
of
his
countenance
sir
landgrave
answered
ulenspiegel
your
will
is
my
pleasure
nevertheless
i
can
not
help
feeling
sorry
at
the
thought
that
if
your
lordship
is
painted
by
himself
he
will
feel
lonely
perhaps
all
there
in
solitary
state
through
the
ages
to
come
surely
he
should
be
accompanied
by
his
noble
wife
madame
the
landgravine
by
her
lords
and
ladies
and
by
his
captains
and
most
warlike
officers
of
state
in
the
midst
of
these
my
lord
and
his
lady
will
shine
like
twin
suns
surrounded
by
lanterns
well
painter
mine
and
how
much
shall
i
have
to
pay
you
for
this
mighty
work
one
hundred
florins
either
now
or
later
just
as
you
will
here
they
are
in
advance
said
the
landgrave
most
compassionate
master
said
ulenspiegel
as
he
took
the
money
you
have
filled
my
lamp
with
oil
and
now
it
shall
burn
bright
in
your
honour
on
the
next
day
ulenspiegel
asked
the
landgrave
to
let
him
see
those
persons
who
were
to
have
the
honour
of
being
painted
and
first
there
came
before
him
the
duke
of
lüneburg
commander
of
the
infantry
of
the
landgrave
he
was
a
stout
man
who
carried
with
difficulty
his
great
paunch
swollen
with
food
he
went
up
to
ulenspiegel
and
whispered
in
his
ear
when
you
paint
my
portrait
see
that
you
take
off
half
my
fat
at
least
else
will
i
order
my
soldiers
to
have
you
hung
the
duke
passed
on
and
next
there
came
a
noble
lady
with
a
hump
on
her
back
and
a
bosom
as
flat
as
a
sir
painter
said
she
unless
you
remove
the
hump
on
my
back
and
give
me
a
couple
of
others
in
the
place
where
they
should
be
verily
i
will
have
you
drawn
and
quartered
as
if
you
were
a
prisoner
the
lady
went
away
and
now
there
appeared
a
young
maid
of
honour
fair
fresh
and
comely
only
that
she
lacked
three
teeth
under
her
upper
lip
sir
painter
said
she
if
you
do
not
paint
me
smiling
and
showing
through
my
parted
lips
a
perfect
set
of
teeth
i
have
you
chopped
up
into
small
pieces
at
the
hands
of
my
gallant
there
he
is
look
at
him
and
she
pointed
to
that
captain
of
artillery
who
a
while
ago
had
been
playing
dice
on
the
palace
steps
and
she
went
her
way
the
procession
continued
until
at
last
ulenspiegel
was
left
alone
with
the
landgrave
the
landgrave
said
to
him
my
friend
let
me
warn
you
that
if
your
painting
has
the
misfortune
to
be
inaccurate
or
false
to
all
these
various
physiognomies
by
so
much
as
a
single
feature
i
will
have
your
throat
cut
as
if
you
were
a
chicken
if
i
am
to
have
my
head
cut
off
thought
ulenspiegel
if
i
am
to
be
drawn
and
quartered
chopped
up
into
small
pieces
and
finally
hung
i
should
do
better
to
paint
no
portrait
at
all
i
must
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
and
where
is
the
hall
he
asked
the
landgrave
which
i
am
to
adorn
with
all
these
likenesses
follow
me
said
the
landgrave
and
he
brought
him
to
a
large
room
with
great
bare
walls
this
is
the
hall
he
said
i
should
be
very
grateful
said
ulenspiegel
if
some
curtains
could
be
hung
right
along
the
walls
so
that
my
paintings
may
be
protected
from
the
flies
and
the
dust
certainly
said
the
landgrave
when
the
curtains
had
been
hung
as
directed
ulenspiegel
asked
if
he
might
have
three
apprentices
to
help
him
with
the
mixing
of
his
colours
this
was
done
and
for
thirty
days
ulenspiegel
and
the
apprentices
spent
the
whole
of
their
time
feasting
and
carousing
together
with
every
extravagance
of
meat
and
drink
and
the
landgrave
looked
on
at
it
all
but
at
last
on
the
day
he
came
and
thrust
his
nose
in
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
where
ulenspiegel
had
begged
him
not
to
enter
well
tyl
he
said
and
where
are
the
portraits
they
are
not
finished
answered
ulenspiegel
when
shall
i
be
able
to
see
them
not
just
yet
said
ulenspiegel
on
the
day
the
landgrave
again
thrust
his
nose
inside
the
door
well
tyl
he
inquired
how
now
ah
sir
landgrave
said
ulenspiegel
the
portraits
are
getting
on
on
the
sixtieth
day
the
landgrave
grew
very
angry
and
coming
right
into
the
room
show
me
the
pictures
at
once
he
cried
i
will
do
so
answered
ulenspiegel
but
pray
have
the
kindness
not
to
draw
the
curtain
until
you
have
summoned
hither
the
lords
and
captains
and
ladies
of
your
court
very
well
said
the
landgrave
and
at
his
command
the
aforesaid
notabilities
appeared
ulenspiegel
took
up
his
stand
in
front
of
the
curtain
which
was
still
carefully
drawn
my
lord
landgrave
he
said
and
you
madame
the
landgravine
and
you
my
lord
of
lüneburg
and
you
others
fine
ladies
and
valiant
captains
know
that
behind
this
curtain
have
i
portrayed
to
the
best
of
my
abilities
your
faces
every
one
warlike
or
gentle
as
the
case
may
be
it
will
be
quite
easy
for
each
one
of
you
to
recognize
himself
and
that
you
are
anxious
to
see
yourselves
is
only
natural
but
i
pray
you
have
patience
and
suffer
me
to
speak
a
word
or
two
before
the
curtain
is
drawn
know
this
fair
ladies
and
valiant
captains
all
you
that
are
of
noble
blood
shall
behold
my
paintings
and
rejoice
but
if
there
be
among
you
any
that
is
of
low
or
humble
birth
such
an
one
will
see
nothing
but
a
blank
wall
so
there
and
now
have
the
goodness
to
open
wide
your
noble
eyes
and
so
saying
ulenspiegel
drew
the
curtain
remember
said
he
again
only
they
of
noble
birth
can
see
my
pictures
whether
they
be
lords
or
ladies
and
again
presently
he
of
low
birth
is
blind
to
my
pictures
but
he
who
clearly
sees
that
man
is
a
nobleman
without
a
doubt
at
that
every
one
present
opened
wide
his
eyes
pretending
you
may
be
sure
to
see
and
feigning
to
recognize
the
various
faces
and
pointing
themselves
out
to
one
another
though
in
reality
they
beheld
nothing
at
all
but
a
bare
wall
and
for
this
they
were
each
and
all
secretly
ashamed
suddenly
the
court
jester
who
was
standing
by
jumped
three
feet
in
the
air
and
jaggled
his
bells
take
me
for
a
villain
he
cried
a
most
villainous
villain
but
i
verily
will
affirm
and
assert
and
say
with
trumpets
and
fanfares
that
there
i
see
a
wall
a
blank
white
wall
and
nothing
but
a
wall
so
help
me
god
and
his
saints
ulenspiegel
said
when
fools
talking
time
for
wise
men
to
be
walking
and
he
was
about
to
leave
the
palace
when
the
landgrave
stopped
him
fool
in
your
folly
said
he
you
make
boast
that
you
go
through
the
world
praising
what
is
good
and
fair
and
making
mock
of
foolery
and
you
have
dared
to
make
open
game
of
so
many
and
so
ladies
and
of
their
yet
more
noble
lords
bringing
ridicule
on
the
pride
of
their
nobility
of
a
truth
i
tell
you
that
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
hang
for
your
free
speech
if
the
cord
is
of
gold
said
ulenspiegel
it
will
break
with
dread
at
my
approach
stay
said
the
landgrave
here
is
the
first
bit
of
your
rope
and
he
gave
him
fifteen
florins
all
thanks
to
you
said
ulenspiegel
and
i
promise
you
that
every
tavern
on
the
road
shall
have
a
thread
of
it
a
thread
of
that
gold
which
makes
croesuses
of
all
those
rascally
and
off
he
went
on
his
donkey
holding
his
head
up
high
in
air
with
the
plume
in
his
cap
wagging
joyously
in
the
breeze
xxxiv
now
was
the
season
of
yellowing
leaves
and
the
winds
of
autumn
were
beginning
to
blow
sometimes
for
an
hour
or
two
it
seemed
that
katheline
was
come
into
her
right
mind
again
and
at
such
times
claes
would
say
that
the
merciful
spirit
of
god
had
come
to
visit
her
then
it
was
that
she
had
power
to
throw
a
charm
upon
nele
by
signs
and
incantations
so
that
the
girl
was
able
to
see
whatever
was
happening
all
over
the
world
in
the
public
squares
of
the
cities
or
on
the
highways
or
in
the
houses
themselves
katheline
was
in
one
of
these
moods
of
and
she
was
eating
with
claes
soetkin
and
nele
claes
said
this
is
the
day
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
abdication
nele
my
dear
do
you
think
you
could
see
as
far
as
brussels
in
brabant
if
katheline
wishes
me
to
said
nele
thereupon
katheline
caused
her
to
sit
down
on
a
bench
and
making
sundry
passes
with
her
hands
she
muttered
her
incantations
which
soon
sent
the
girl
off
into
a
trance
then
katheline
said
to
her
make
your
way
into
the
little
house
which
is
called
the
park
house
and
is
the
favourite
residence
of
the
emperor
charles
the
fifth
whereupon
nele
began
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
as
though
she
were
half
suffocated
i
am
standing
in
a
small
room
painted
green
there
is
a
man
in
the
room
he
is
about
years
of
age
and
he
has
a
bald
head
and
a
protruding
chin
with
a
white
beard
growing
upon
it
his
grey
eyes
have
a
wicked
crafty
look
filled
with
cruelty
and
false
kindness
and
this
is
the
man
they
call
most
sacred
majesty
he
suffers
from
a
catarrh
and
always
keeps
coughing
beside
him
is
another
a
young
man
with
an
ugly
face
like
that
of
a
hydrocephalous
monkey
i
saw
him
once
at
antwerp
he
is
king
philip
at
the
present
moment
he
is
being
rebuked
by
his
sacred
majesty
for
having
slept
out
last
night
away
from
home
doubtless
says
his
majesty
he
was
at
some
brothel
in
company
of
a
trollop
of
the
town
his
hair
it
seems
smells
of
the
tavern
no
place
that
for
a
king
to
seek
his
pleasures
in
he
who
may
have
his
choice
of
all
the
sweetest
bodies
in
the
world
of
skin
like
satin
fresh
from
perfumed
baths
and
of
hands
of
ladies
very
amorous
such
as
these
says
his
majesty
are
more
fit
for
him
surely
than
some
wench
that
is
come
scarcely
washed
from
the
arms
of
a
drunken
soldier
for
there
is
not
one
among
all
the
ladies
the
most
noble
the
most
beautiful
whether
virgin
wife
or
widow
that
would
resist
king
philip
and
they
would
be
proud
to
give
him
of
their
love
not
by
a
greasy
glimmer
of
stinking
tallow
but
by
the
light
of
scented
tapers
made
of
finest
wax
the
king
replies
that
he
will
obey
his
sacred
majesty
in
all
things
whereupon
his
sacred
majesty
has
a
fit
of
coughing
and
drinks
some
draughts
of
hippocras
after
which
he
addresses
his
son
sorrowfully
in
these
words
must
know
my
son
that
very
soon
i
am
to
give
to
the
world
the
mighty
spectacle
of
the
abdication
of
my
throne
in
the
favour
of
you
my
son
and
i
shall
speak
before
a
great
crowd
of
people
coughing
and
hiccuping
as
i
am
for
all
my
life
i
have
eaten
too
heartily
and
very
must
you
be
if
you
shed
no
tears
when
you
hear
what
i
shall
have
to
say
shall
shed
many
tears
answers
king
philip
and
now
his
sacred
majesty
is
speaking
to
his
valet
a
man
named
dubois
me
some
sugar
dipped
in
madeira
he
cries
have
the
hiccups
pray
heaven
they
do
not
attack
me
when
i
am
making
my
speech
before
all
those
people
oh
that
goose
i
had
last
night
for
dinner
will
it
never
pass
i
think
i
had
better
take
a
glass
of
orleans
wine
no
it
is
too
harsh
or
perhaps
if
i
ate
some
anchovies
no
they
are
oily
dubois
there
give
me
some
roman
wine
dubois
does
as
he
is
told
then
dresses
his
master
in
a
robe
of
crimson
velvet
wraps
a
golden
cloak
about
him
girds
on
his
sword
places
the
globe
and
sceptre
in
his
hands
and
on
his
head
the
crown
thus
arrayed
his
sacred
majesty
goes
forth
from
the
park
house
riding
on
a
little
mule
and
followed
by
king
philip
and
many
notables
presently
they
arrive
at
a
large
building
called
the
palace
and
they
come
to
a
room
wherein
is
a
tall
thin
man
most
richly
dressed
he
is
the
prince
of
orange
william
surnamed
the
silent
i
look
well
cousin
william
his
sacred
majesty
inquires
but
the
man
makes
no
answer
till
at
length
his
sacred
majesty
speaks
again
half
mused
half
angry
silent
cousin
still
without
a
word
even
when
you
have
the
chance
of
telling
the
truth
to
a
come
now
shall
i
abdicate
or
stay
upon
my
throne
o
silent
one
sacred
majesty
replies
the
thin
man
the
approach
of
winter
even
the
strongest
oaks
let
fall
their
leaves
three
strikes
me
your
shoulder
silent
one
that
i
may
lean
upon
it
and
so
saying
his
most
sacred
majesty
leads
the
way
into
a
great
room
wherein
is
a
canopy
and
under
the
canopy
a
dais
covered
with
a
carpet
of
crimson
silk
on
the
dais
are
three
chairs
his
sacred
majesty
seats
himself
on
the
one
which
is
more
ornamented
than
the
others
and
surmounted
by
the
imperial
crown
king
philip
takes
the
second
chair
and
the
third
is
occupied
by
a
woman
who
is
no
doubt
the
queen
on
either
side
are
long
benches
covered
with
tapestry
and
sitting
upon
them
are
men
dressed
in
red
robes
and
wearing
round
their
necks
the
image
of
a
golden
sheep
behind
stand
various
personages
who
would
seem
to
be
princes
and
lords
opposite
these
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
dais
there
is
a
row
of
bare
benches
which
are
occupied
by
men
dressed
in
plain
cloth
i
hear
it
said
that
these
men
are
clothed
and
seated
so
modestly
because
it
is
themselves
that
have
to
pay
all
the
costs
at
the
entrance
of
his
sacred
majesty
these
people
all
stand
up
but
when
he
has
sat
down
he
makes
a
sign
and
they
sit
also
now
a
very
aged
man
is
talking
of
his
gout
interminably
after
which
the
woman
who
seems
to
be
a
queen
presents
a
roll
of
parchment
to
his
majesty
his
sacred
majesty
reads
what
is
written
thereon
in
a
low
voice
coughing
all
the
time
and
then
he
begins
to
speak
for
himself
and
long
are
the
journeys
that
i
have
made
through
spain
and
italy
and
the
netherlands
through
england
and
through
africa
all
for
god
glory
for
the
renown
of
my
arms
and
the
good
of
my
peoples
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
at
last
he
comes
to
tell
of
his
growing
weakness
and
fatigue
and
of
his
determination
to
relinquish
the
crown
of
spain
together
with
the
counties
duchies
and
marquisates
of
all
those
countries
and
of
his
desire
to
hand
them
over
to
his
son
thereafter
he
begins
to
weep
and
every
one
weeps
with
him
and
king
philip
gets
up
from
his
chair
and
falls
upon
his
knees
before
his
father
sacred
majesty
he
cries
i
indeed
to
receive
this
crown
from
your
hands
while
yet
you
are
so
strong
to
wear
it
then
his
majesty
whispers
into
his
son
ear
that
he
should
speak
some
kindly
words
to
those
men
who
are
seated
upon
the
tapestried
chairs
whereupon
king
philip
turns
towards
them
and
without
rising
addresses
them
in
a
sharp
tone
of
voice
understand
french
fairly
well
he
says
not
well
enough
to
be
able
to
talk
to
any
one
in
that
language
but
the
bishop
of
arras
monsieur
grandvelle
he
will
say
something
to
you
on
my
behalf
is
not
the
way
to
speak
to
them
my
son
says
his
sacred
majesty
and
in
truth
the
whole
assembly
begins
to
murmur
seeing
the
young
king
so
proud
and
unbending
the
woman
she
who
is
the
queen
then
makes
an
oration
and
is
followed
by
an
aged
professor
who
on
sitting
down
receives
a
wave
of
the
hand
from
his
sacred
majesty
by
way
of
thanks
these
ceremonies
and
harangues
being
finished
his
sacred
majesty
makes
a
declaration
to
the
effect
that
his
subjects
are
released
from
their
oath
of
fidelity
signs
the
deeds
drawn
up
to
ratify
his
abdication
and
then
rising
from
his
throne
places
his
son
upon
it
in
his
stead
every
one
in
the
hall
weeps
then
they
return
again
to
the
park
house
once
more
his
sacred
majesty
and
his
son
philip
are
alone
together
in
the
green
chamber
as
soon
as
the
doors
are
shut
his
sacred
majesty
goes
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
begins
talking
to
king
philip
who
keeps
quite
solemn
all
the
time
you
notice
says
the
emperor
laughing
and
hiccuping
at
the
same
time
little
was
needed
to
move
these
good
people
to
tears
heavens
how
they
wept
you
would
have
thought
it
was
the
deluge
that
fat
maes
who
made
the
long
speech
why
he
cried
like
a
calf
even
you
appeared
to
be
affected
but
not
quite
sufficiently
perhaps
really
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
are
the
best
of
all
the
entertainments
which
one
can
provide
for
the
populace
for
just
as
we
nobles
are
wont
to
cherish
most
those
mistresses
who
cost
us
most
so
also
it
is
with
the
people
the
more
we
make
them
pay
the
more
they
love
us
that
is
why
i
have
tolerated
the
reformed
religion
in
germany
while
punishing
it
severely
in
the
low
countries
if
however
the
german
princes
had
been
catholics
i
would
have
made
myself
a
lutheran
so
that
i
might
confiscate
their
property
verily
they
all
believe
in
the
integrity
of
my
zeal
for
the
roman
faith
and
when
i
leave
them
they
are
full
of
regrets
yet
for
heresy
there
have
perished
at
my
hands
fifty
thousand
of
their
bravest
men
and
of
their
tenderest
maidens
in
the
netherlands
alone
but
still
they
grieve
at
my
departure
and
without
making
any
count
of
what
has
been
got
from
confiscations
i
have
raised
in
taxes
more
than
the
wealth
of
all
the
indies
or
peru
yet
they
are
sorry
to
lose
me
and
i
have
torn
up
the
peace
of
cadzant
brought
the
city
of
ghent
under
subjection
suppressed
every
one
who
might
be
dangerous
to
me
put
down
all
liberties
freedoms
and
privileges
and
placed
them
under
the
authority
of
the
royal
officers
but
yet
do
these
good
people
think
they
are
still
free
inasmuch
as
i
allow
them
to
shoot
with
the
crossbow
and
to
carry
in
procession
the
banners
of
their
guilds
willingly
do
they
submit
themselves
to
the
hand
of
their
master
finding
happiness
in
a
cage
and
singing
his
praises
while
he
is
with
them
and
weeping
when
he
departs
my
son
be
you
to
them
even
as
i
have
been
kindly
in
words
but
harsh
in
deed
lick
that
which
you
have
no
need
to
bite
and
never
leave
off
swearing
to
maintain
liberties
freedoms
and
privileges
however
little
you
may
scruple
to
destroy
those
liberties
if
they
show
signs
of
becoming
dangerous
for
such
things
as
these
are
like
iron
if
handled
timidly
but
brittle
as
glass
if
grappled
with
a
strong
hand
therefore
you
should
root
out
all
heresy
not
because
it
differs
from
the
roman
religion
but
because
if
allowed
to
flourish
it
would
mean
the
end
of
our
rule
in
all
the
netherlands
for
they
that
attack
the
pope
with
his
three
crowns
would
finish
by
denying
the
authority
of
the
temporal
princes
who
wear
but
one
so
then
you
should
follow
my
example
and
regard
all
claims
to
freedom
of
conscience
as
crimes
of
high
treason
to
be
punished
by
immediate
confiscation
hereby
you
will
inherit
great
riches
as
i
also
have
done
all
my
life
long
and
when
you
come
to
die
or
to
abdicate
everybody
will
say
me
the
good
and
noble
prince
and
many
are
the
tears
that
will
be
shed
and
now
i
hear
no
more
said
nele
for
his
sacred
majesty
has
laid
him
down
to
sleep
and
king
philip
that
proud
and
haughty
prince
stands
gazing
at
him
with
loveless
eyes
and
when
she
had
thus
spoken
nele
was
awakened
from
her
trance
by
katheline
and
claes
gazed
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
as
it
flamed
and
lit
up
all
the
chimney
xxxv
it
was
the
month
of
april
the
weather
had
been
mild
but
now
there
was
come
a
sharp
frost
and
a
sky
grey
and
overcast
as
it
were
the
sky
of
all
souls
day
the
third
year
of
ulenspiegel
banishment
had
long
since
passed
and
nele
was
waiting
day
after
day
for
the
return
of
her
lover
alas
she
cried
there
will
be
snow
on
the
and
snow
upon
the
flowering
jasmines
and
on
all
the
poor
plants
that
have
bloomed
in
confidence
of
the
mildness
and
the
warmth
of
an
early
spring
already
from
the
sky
little
snowflakes
are
falling
on
the
roads
and
on
my
poor
heart
as
well
the
snow
is
falling
where
oh
where
are
the
bright
rays
of
sunshine
that
should
be
playing
now
on
our
happy
faces
and
upon
red
roofs
that
were
used
to
grow
the
redder
for
that
warmth
and
on
that
flashed
as
they
caught
that
sunny
brightness
where
indeed
are
those
flaming
beams
that
kindled
earth
to
life
again
and
the
sky
and
the
birds
and
the
insects
alas
for
day
and
night
am
i
chilled
by
sorrow
and
long
waiting
oh
where
where
are
you
my
lover
ulenspiegel
xxxvi
that
sunday
there
was
held
at
bruges
the
procession
of
the
holy
blood
claes
told
his
wife
that
she
and
nele
ought
to
go
and
see
the
procession
and
that
if
they
did
so
it
was
not
impossible
they
might
find
ulenspiegel
in
the
city
as
for
himself
he
would
stay
behind
and
look
after
the
cottage
and
be
ready
to
welcome
their
pilgrim
if
he
should
return
so
the
two
women
went
off
together
claes
remained
at
home
and
sat
himself
down
on
the
doorstep
and
gazed
into
the
deserted
village
street
all
was
quiet
as
the
grave
except
now
and
again
for
the
crystal
sound
of
the
bell
of
some
village
church
or
rising
and
falling
with
every
little
gust
of
wind
from
bruges
the
music
of
the
carillon
and
the
sound
of
the
guns
and
fireworks
that
were
being
let
off
in
honour
of
the
holy
blood
but
in
spite
of
all
these
sounds
of
joy
claes
was
filled
with
sadness
scanning
the
grey
mist
that
hung
over
the
fields
for
a
sight
of
his
son
and
trying
to
hear
his
footfall
in
the
jolly
rustling
of
leaves
and
gay
concert
of
birds
as
they
sang
among
the
trees
suddenly
he
noticed
a
man
coming
down
towards
him
on
the
road
from
maldeghem
it
was
a
man
tall
of
stature
but
it
was
not
ulenspiegel
and
presently
claes
saw
him
come
to
a
stand
beside
a
field
of
carrots
and
bend
down
to
eat
of
the
vegetables
as
if
he
were
starving
for
food
there
a
hungry
man
sure
said
claes
to
himself
but
after
a
while
the
man
continued
his
walk
and
passed
out
of
view
to
reappear
a
little
later
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
héron
claes
recognized
him
at
once
as
the
messenger
who
had
brought
the
seven
hundred
ducats
from
his
brother
josse
he
went
to
meet
him
and
asked
him
in
blessed
are
they
that
are
kind
to
the
wandering
traveller
said
the
man
and
readily
accepted
the
proffered
invitation
now
on
the
of
the
cottage
window
lay
some
which
soetkin
kept
ready
for
the
birds
of
the
neighbourhood
who
had
learnt
to
come
there
during
the
winter
for
their
food
the
man
took
these
crumbs
and
ate
them
you
must
be
hungry
and
thirsty
said
claes
eight
days
ago
was
i
robbed
by
thieves
the
man
replied
and
since
then
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
but
the
carrots
i
have
found
in
the
fields
and
roots
in
the
forest
well
then
said
claes
i
am
thinking
it
is
time
you
had
a
good
round
meal
and
so
saying
he
opened
the
look
he
continued
here
is
a
dishful
of
peas
and
here
are
eggs
puddings
hams
sausages
from
ghent
waterzoey
a
hotchpotch
of
fish
and
down
below
in
the
cellar
there
slumbers
our
good
wine
from
louvain
made
after
the
manner
of
burgundy
wine
all
clear
and
red
as
rubies
only
the
glasses
are
wanting
now
to
rouse
it
from
its
sleep
and
to
crown
all
let
us
put
a
faggot
to
the
fire
already
i
can
hear
the
pudding
singing
in
the
grill
and
that
a
song
of
right
good
cheer
my
friend
claes
kept
turning
the
puddings
and
as
he
did
so
he
inquired
of
the
stranger
whether
he
had
seen
his
son
ulenspiegel
no
was
the
answer
then
perhaps
you
bring
me
news
of
my
brother
claes
said
as
he
placed
the
puddings
now
well
grilled
upon
the
table
together
with
a
ham
omelette
some
cheese
and
two
big
tankards
of
gleaming
louvain
wine
both
red
and
white
the
man
said
your
brother
josse
has
been
done
to
death
upon
the
rack
at
sippenaken
near
to
aix
and
all
because
he
was
a
heretic
and
bore
arms
against
the
emperor
claes
was
like
one
mad
and
he
shook
all
over
for
his
wrath
was
great
wicked
brutes
he
cried
o
josse
my
poor
josse
then
the
stranger
spoke
again
but
in
a
voice
that
held
no
sweetness
not
in
this
world
my
friend
is
to
be
found
just
cause
either
for
joy
or
for
sorrow
and
he
fell
to
his
food
but
after
a
while
he
spoke
again
you
must
know
that
i
was
able
to
be
of
some
assistance
to
your
brother
while
he
was
in
prison
by
pretending
that
i
was
one
of
his
relatives
a
peasant
from
nieswieler
i
am
now
come
hither
in
obedience
to
his
command
that
if
i
was
not
killed
for
the
faith
like
him
i
should
go
to
you
and
charge
you
in
his
name
to
live
in
the
faith
and
peace
of
our
saviour
practising
all
works
of
mercy
and
educating
your
son
in
secret
in
the
law
of
christ
money
he
said
i
gave
to
my
brother
was
money
taken
from
the
poor
and
ignorant
let
claes
make
use
of
it
in
rearing
tyl
in
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
his
word
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
the
messenger
gave
claes
the
kiss
of
peace
and
claes
made
moan
and
lamentation
saying
dead
upon
the
rack
alas
my
poor
josse
and
his
grief
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
put
it
from
him
nevertheless
when
he
saw
that
the
messenger
was
consumed
with
thirst
and
held
out
his
glass
for
more
wine
claes
poured
out
again
but
he
himself
ate
and
drank
without
pleasure
now
soetkin
and
nele
remained
away
for
seven
days
and
all
this
time
the
messenger
stayed
beneath
the
roof
of
claes
and
every
night
they
heard
katheline
howling
in
her
cottage
over
the
way
fire
fire
make
a
hole
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
and
claes
went
to
her
comforting
her
with
gentle
words
and
afterwards
returned
to
his
own
house
at
the
end
of
the
seven
days
the
messenger
departed
claes
offered
him
money
but
he
would
only
accept
two
caroluses
with
which
to
feed
himself
and
find
lodging
on
his
way
back
home
xxxvii
when
nele
and
soetkin
returned
from
bruges
they
found
claes
in
the
kitchen
sitting
on
the
floor
like
a
tailor
sewing
buttons
on
an
old
pair
of
breeches
titus
bibulus
schnouffius
barked
his
welcome
claes
smiled
and
nele
smiled
in
answer
but
soetkin
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
road
gazing
continually
in
hopes
to
see
her
beloved
ulenspiegel
all
of
a
sudden
she
broke
silence
look
she
cried
here
is
the
he
is
coming
along
the
road
with
four
sergeants
of
the
peace
they
can
not
be
wanting
any
one
from
here
surely
and
yet
there
are
two
of
them
turning
off
by
the
cottage
claes
looked
up
from
his
work
and
the
other
two
have
stopped
at
the
front
soetkin
said
then
claes
got
up
who
can
they
want
to
arrest
in
this
road
his
wife
continued
and
then
o
christ
they
are
coming
in
here
look
to
the
money
cried
claes
the
caroluses
are
hidden
away
behind
the
fireplace
and
with
these
words
he
ran
out
of
the
kitchen
into
the
garden
nele
understood
what
he
meant
and
saw
that
he
was
going
to
try
and
make
his
escape
over
the
hedge
but
the
sergeants
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
now
he
was
hitting
out
at
them
in
a
hopeless
endeavour
to
break
free
he
is
innocent
nele
cried
aloud
amid
her
tears
he
is
innocent
do
not
hurt
him
it
is
claes
my
father
o
ulenspiegel
where
are
you
where
are
you
if
you
were
only
here
you
would
kill
them
both
and
she
threw
herself
on
one
of
the
sergeants
and
tore
at
his
face
with
her
nails
then
she
cried
out
again
they
will
kill
him
and
fell
down
upon
the
grass
in
the
garden
and
rolled
there
in
her
despair
katheline
hearing
the
noise
had
come
out
from
her
cottage
and
stood
up
straight
and
immovable
gazing
at
the
piteous
scene
then
she
spoke
wagging
her
head
fire
fire
make
a
hole
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
soetkin
meanwhile
who
had
seen
nothing
of
all
this
was
talking
to
the
sergeants
who
had
entered
the
cottage
kind
sirs
she
began
what
is
it
that
you
are
looking
for
in
our
poor
dwelling
if
it
is
my
son
you
want
he
is
far
away
do
you
feel
equal
to
a
long
journey
and
she
felt
quite
pleased
at
the
way
she
was
handling
the
matter
but
it
was
at
this
very
moment
that
nele
began
to
cry
aloud
for
help
and
when
soetkin
had
made
her
way
into
the
garden
it
was
to
see
her
husband
seized
by
the
collar
and
fighting
on
the
pathway
near
the
hedge
hit
hard
and
kill
them
she
cried
and
then
o
ulenspiegel
where
are
you
and
she
was
about
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
her
man
when
one
of
the
sergeants
caught
hold
of
her
not
indeed
without
some
danger
to
himself
and
claes
was
fighting
and
hitting
out
so
forcibly
that
he
would
certainly
have
escaped
had
not
the
two
sergeants
with
whom
soetkin
had
been
talking
come
out
to
aid
their
fellows
in
the
nick
of
time
so
at
last
they
were
able
to
tie
the
hands
of
claes
together
and
to
carry
him
back
to
the
kitchen
whither
nele
and
soetkin
had
already
come
crying
and
sobbing
sir
provost
soetkin
said
what
crime
has
he
committed
that
you
are
binding
my
poor
husband
thus
with
cords
he
is
a
heretic
said
one
of
the
sergeants
heretic
cried
soetkin
looking
towards
her
husband
you
a
heretic
these
devils
are
lying
claes
answered
i
resign
myself
into
god
keeping
and
they
took
him
away
nele
and
soetkin
followed
behind
in
tears
believing
that
they
also
would
be
summoned
before
the
judge
they
were
joined
by
many
of
their
friends
and
neighbours
but
when
these
heard
that
it
was
on
a
charge
of
heresy
that
claes
was
walking
thus
in
chains
fear
came
upon
them
and
they
returned
incontinently
to
their
houses
closing
their
doors
behind
them
only
a
few
young
girls
had
the
courage
to
approach
claes
and
say
to
him
whither
are
you
going
to
in
these
bonds
i
go
unto
the
grace
of
god
my
girls
he
answered
them
so
they
took
him
away
to
the
town
gaol
and
nele
and
soetkin
sat
themselves
down
upon
the
threshold
and
towards
evening
soetkin
besought
nele
to
leave
her
and
to
go
and
see
if
ulenspiegel
had
perchance
returned
xxxviii
the
news
spread
quickly
through
the
neighbourhood
that
a
man
had
been
taken
prisoner
on
a
charge
of
heresy
and
that
the
inquisitor
titelman
dean
of
renaix
surnamed
the
inquisitor
without
pity
had
been
appointed
judge
now
at
this
time
ulenspiegel
was
living
at
koolkerke
in
the
intimate
favour
of
a
farmer
widow
a
sweet
and
gentle
person
who
refused
him
nothing
of
what
was
hers
to
give
he
was
very
happy
there
petted
and
made
much
of
until
one
day
a
treacherous
rival
an
alderman
of
the
village
lay
in
wait
for
him
early
in
the
morning
when
he
was
coming
out
of
the
tavern
and
would
have
beaten
him
with
a
wooden
club
but
ulenspiegel
thinking
to
cool
his
rival
anger
threw
him
into
a
that
was
full
of
water
and
the
alderman
scrambled
out
as
best
he
could
green
as
a
toad
and
dripping
like
a
sponge
as
a
result
of
this
mighty
deed
ulenspiegel
found
it
convenient
to
depart
from
koolkerke
and
off
he
went
to
damme
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
fearing
the
vengeance
of
the
alderman
the
night
fell
cold
and
ulenspiegel
ran
quickly
for
he
was
longing
to
be
home
again
and
already
he
saw
in
imagination
nele
sewing
by
the
fire
soetkin
getting
ready
the
supper
claes
binding
up
his
sticks
and
schnouffius
gnawing
at
a
bone
a
tramping
pedlar
met
him
on
the
road
and
asked
him
whither
he
was
off
to
so
fast
and
at
that
time
of
night
to
my
home
in
damme
ulenspiegel
told
him
the
tramp
said
that
town
is
no
longer
safe
they
are
arresting
the
reformers
there
and
he
passed
on
presently
ulenspiegel
arrived
at
the
inn
of
the
roode
schildt
and
went
in
for
a
glass
of
dobbel
kuyt
the
innkeeper
said
to
him
are
you
not
the
son
of
claes
i
am
said
ulenspiegel
make
haste
then
said
the
innkeeper
for
the
hour
of
evil
fortune
has
sounded
for
your
father
ulenspiegel
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
these
words
and
the
innkeeper
told
him
that
he
would
know
soon
enough
so
ulenspiegel
left
the
inn
and
continued
on
his
way
running
apace
when
he
arrived
at
the
outskirts
of
damme
the
dogs
that
stood
by
the
doorways
came
running
round
his
legs
jumping
up
at
him
yelping
and
barking
hearing
this
noise
the
women
also
came
out
of
their
houses
and
when
they
saw
who
it
was
they
all
began
talking
at
once
whence
come
you
they
cried
and
have
you
any
news
of
your
father
and
do
you
know
where
your
mother
is
is
she
in
prison
too
alas
heaven
send
they
do
not
bring
him
to
the
stake
ulenspiegel
ran
on
faster
than
ever
he
met
nele
tyl
she
said
you
must
not
go
home
they
have
set
guards
in
our
house
in
the
name
of
his
majesty
ulenspiegel
stopped
running
nele
he
said
is
it
true
that
claes
my
father
is
in
prison
it
is
true
nele
said
and
soetkin
sits
weeping
at
the
gaol
door
then
the
heart
of
the
prodigal
son
swelled
with
grief
and
he
said
i
must
go
to
them
no
said
nele
first
you
must
do
what
claes
told
me
just
before
he
was
taken
away
to
the
money
he
said
is
hidden
at
the
back
of
the
grate
you
must
make
sure
of
that
first
of
everything
for
it
is
the
inheritance
of
poor
soetkin
but
ulenspiegel
would
not
hear
aught
and
ran
on
quickly
to
the
gaol
there
he
found
soetkin
sitting
at
the
gate
she
embraced
him
with
many
tears
and
they
cried
on
one
another
neck
knowing
that
they
were
there
the
populace
began
to
crowd
in
front
of
the
prison
then
the
sergeants
arrived
and
told
soetkin
and
ulenspiegel
that
they
were
to
go
away
at
once
so
mother
and
son
returned
to
cottage
which
was
next
door
to
their
own
and
was
being
guarded
by
one
of
the
who
had
been
sent
for
from
bruges
in
case
there
might
be
trouble
during
the
trial
and
execution
of
claes
for
it
was
well
known
that
the
people
of
damme
loved
him
exceedingly
the
soldier
was
sitting
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
door
draining
the
last
drops
of
brandy
from
a
flask
finding
it
was
all
gone
he
threw
the
flask
away
and
was
amusing
himself
by
dislodging
the
stones
on
the
path
with
the
point
of
his
dagger
soetkin
went
in
to
katheline
crying
most
bitterly
but
katheline
said
fire
fire
make
a
hole
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
and
she
kept
wagging
her
head
xxxix
borgstorm
the
great
bell
of
damme
had
summoned
the
judges
to
judgment
it
was
four
and
now
they
were
collected
together
at
the
vierschare
around
the
tree
of
justice
claes
was
brought
before
them
seated
upon
the
dais
was
the
high
bailiff
of
damme
and
by
his
side
opposite
claes
the
mayor
the
alderman
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
populace
ran
together
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
a
great
crowd
they
were
and
many
of
them
were
saying
that
the
judges
were
there
to
do
not
justice
but
merely
the
will
of
his
imperial
majesty
after
certain
preliminaries
the
high
bailiff
began
to
make
proclamation
of
the
acts
and
deeds
for
which
claes
had
been
summoned
before
that
tribunal
the
informer
he
said
had
been
staying
by
chance
at
damme
not
wishing
to
spend
all
his
money
at
bruges
in
feasting
and
festivity
as
is
too
often
the
case
during
these
sacred
occasions
on
a
time
then
when
he
was
taking
the
air
soberly
on
his
own
doorstep
he
saw
a
man
walking
towards
him
along
the
rue
héron
this
man
claes
also
saw
and
went
up
to
him
and
greeted
him
the
stranger
who
was
dressed
all
in
black
entered
the
house
of
claes
leaving
the
door
into
the
street
half
open
curious
to
find
out
who
the
man
was
the
informer
went
into
the
vestibule
and
heard
claes
talking
to
the
stranger
in
the
kitchen
the
talk
was
all
about
a
certain
josse
the
brother
of
claes
who
it
seems
had
been
made
prisoner
among
the
army
of
the
reformers
and
had
suffered
the
punishment
of
being
broken
alive
on
the
wheel
of
torture
not
far
from
aix
the
stranger
said
that
he
had
brought
claes
a
sum
of
money
which
his
brother
had
desired
to
leave
him
which
money
having
been
gained
from
the
ignorant
and
it
behoved
claes
to
spend
it
in
bringing
up
his
own
son
in
the
reformed
faith
he
also
urged
claes
to
quit
the
bosom
of
our
holy
mother
church
and
spake
also
many
other
impious
words
to
which
the
only
reply
vouchsafed
by
claes
was
this
cruel
brutes
alas
my
poor
josse
so
did
the
prisoner
blaspheme
against
our
holy
father
the
pope
and
against
his
royal
majesty
accusing
them
of
cruelty
in
that
they
rightly
had
punished
heresy
as
a
crime
of
treason
against
god
and
man
when
the
stranger
had
finished
the
meal
that
claes
put
before
him
our
agent
heard
claes
cry
out
again
poor
josse
may
god
keep
thee
in
his
glory
how
cruel
they
were
to
thee
and
thus
did
he
accuse
god
himself
of
impiety
by
this
suggestion
that
he
could
receive
a
heretic
into
his
heaven
nor
did
claes
ever
cease
to
cry
aloud
alas
my
poor
josse
the
stranger
then
launching
out
into
a
frenzy
like
a
preacher
beginning
his
sermon
fell
to
revile
most
shamefully
our
holy
mother
the
church
will
fall
he
shouted
will
fall
the
mighty
babylon
the
whore
of
rome
and
she
will
become
the
abode
of
demons
and
the
haunt
of
every
bird
accursed
and
claes
meanwhile
continued
the
same
old
cry
brutes
alas
poor
josse
and
the
stranger
went
on
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
begun
saying
an
angel
shall
appear
that
shall
take
a
stone
that
is
great
as
a
millstone
and
shall
cast
it
into
the
sea
crying
thus
shall
it
be
done
to
babylon
the
mighty
and
she
shall
be
no
more
seen
whereupon
says
claes
mouth
is
full
of
bitterness
but
tell
me
when
cometh
that
kingdom
in
which
they
that
are
gentle
of
heart
shall
be
able
to
dwell
in
peace
upon
the
earth
answered
the
stranger
yet
my
lord
antichrist
rules
that
is
the
pope
who
is
the
enemy
to
all
truth
said
claes
speak
with
little
respect
of
the
holy
father
but
he
surely
is
ignorant
of
the
cruel
punishments
which
are
meted
out
to
poor
reformers
at
all
answered
the
stranger
far
from
it
for
it
is
he
who
initiates
the
decrees
and
causes
them
to
be
put
into
force
by
the
emperor
now
by
the
king
the
latter
enjoys
all
the
benefits
of
confiscation
inherits
the
property
of
the
dead
and
finds
it
easy
to
bring
charges
of
heresy
against
those
who
have
any
wealth
claes
said
i
know
that
such
things
are
freely
spoken
of
in
the
land
of
flanders
and
one
may
well
believe
them
for
the
flesh
of
man
is
weak
even
though
the
flesh
be
royal
flesh
o
my
poor
josse
and
by
this
did
claes
give
to
understand
that
heretics
are
punished
because
of
a
vile
desire
on
the
part
of
his
majesty
for
filthy
lucre
the
stranger
wished
to
argue
the
matter
further
but
claes
said
sir
do
not
let
us
continue
this
conversation
for
if
it
were
overheard
i
might
easily
find
myself
involved
in
some
awkward
inquiry
then
claes
got
up
to
go
to
the
cellar
whence
he
presently
returned
with
a
pot
of
beer
am
going
to
shut
the
door
said
he
and
after
that
the
informer
heard
nothing
more
for
he
had
to
make
his
way
out
of
the
house
as
quickly
as
he
could
not
till
it
was
night
was
the
door
again
opened
and
then
the
stranger
came
forth
but
he
soon
returned
knocking
at
the
door
and
calling
to
claes
is
very
cold
and
i
know
not
where
i
am
to
lodge
this
night
give
me
shelter
pray
no
one
has
seen
me
the
town
is
deserted
claes
welcomed
him
in
lit
a
lantern
and
last
of
all
he
was
seen
to
be
leading
the
heretic
up
the
staircase
into
a
little
attic
room
with
a
window
that
looked
out
on
to
the
country
at
this
claes
cried
out
and
who
could
have
reported
all
this
but
you
you
wicked
fishmonger
i
saw
you
on
sunday
standing
at
your
door
as
straight
as
a
post
gazing
up
like
the
hypocrite
you
are
at
the
swallows
in
their
flight
and
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
with
his
finger
at
josse
grypstuiver
the
dean
of
the
fishmongers
who
showed
his
ugly
phiz
in
the
crowd
of
people
and
the
fishmonger
gave
an
evil
smile
when
he
saw
claes
betraying
himself
in
this
way
and
the
people
in
the
crowd
men
women
and
maids
looked
one
at
the
other
and
said
poor
good
man
his
words
will
be
the
death
of
him
without
a
doubt
but
the
clerk
continued
his
depositions
claes
and
the
heretic
stayed
talking
together
for
a
long
time
that
night
and
so
for
six
other
nights
during
which
time
the
stranger
was
seen
to
make
many
gestures
of
menace
or
of
benediction
and
to
lift
up
his
hands
to
heaven
as
do
his
and
claes
appeared
to
approve
of
what
he
said
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
throughout
these
days
and
nights
they
were
speaking
together
opprobriously
of
the
mass
of
the
confessional
of
indulgences
and
of
the
royal
majesty
no
one
heard
it
said
claes
and
i
can
not
be
accused
in
this
way
without
any
evidence
the
clerk
answered
there
is
something
else
that
was
overheard
the
evening
that
the
stranger
left
your
roof
seven
days
after
he
had
first
come
to
you
you
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
end
of
katheline
field
there
he
asked
you
what
you
had
done
with
the
wicked
idols
here
the
bailiff
crossed
himself
of
madame
the
virgin
and
of
nicholas
and
martin
you
replied
that
you
had
broken
them
all
up
and
thrown
them
into
the
well
they
were
in
fact
found
in
the
well
last
night
and
the
pieces
are
now
in
the
at
these
words
claes
appeared
to
be
quite
overcome
the
bailiff
asked
if
he
had
nothing
to
answer
claes
made
a
sign
with
his
head
in
the
negative
the
bailiff
asked
him
if
he
would
not
recant
the
accursed
thoughts
which
had
led
him
to
break
the
images
and
the
impious
delusion
whereby
he
had
spoken
such
evil
words
against
pope
and
emperor
who
were
both
divine
personages
claes
replied
that
his
body
was
the
emperor
but
that
his
soul
was
christ
whose
law
he
desired
to
obey
the
bailiff
asked
him
if
this
law
were
the
same
as
that
of
holy
mother
church
claes
answered
the
law
of
christ
is
written
in
the
holy
gospel
when
ordered
to
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
the
pope
is
the
representative
of
god
on
earth
he
answered
no
when
asked
if
he
believed
that
it
was
forbidden
to
adore
images
of
our
lady
and
of
the
saints
he
replied
that
such
was
idolatry
questioned
as
to
whether
the
practice
of
auricular
confession
was
a
good
and
salutary
thing
he
answered
christ
said
confess
your
sins
one
to
another
he
spoke
out
bravely
though
at
the
same
time
it
was
evident
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
and
in
his
heart
afraid
at
length
eight
having
sounded
and
evening
coming
on
the
members
of
the
tribunal
retired
deferring
their
judgment
until
the
morrow
xl
the
next
day
the
great
bell
borgstorm
clanged
out
its
summons
to
the
judges
of
the
tribunal
when
they
were
all
assembled
at
the
vierschare
seated
upon
the
four
benches
that
were
set
around
the
claes
was
afresh
and
asked
if
he
was
willing
to
recant
his
errors
but
claes
lifted
his
hand
towards
heaven
the
lord
christ
beholdeth
me
from
on
high
he
said
and
when
my
son
ulenspiegel
was
born
i
also
gazed
upon
his
sun
where
is
ulenspiegel
now
where
is
he
now
the
vagabond
o
soetkin
sweet
wife
will
you
be
brave
in
the
day
of
trouble
then
looking
at
the
he
cursed
it
saying
south
wind
and
drouth
i
adjure
you
to
make
the
trees
of
our
fathers
perish
one
and
all
where
they
stand
rather
than
that
beneath
their
shade
freedom
of
conscience
shall
be
judged
to
death
o
ulenspiegel
my
son
where
are
you
harsh
was
i
unto
you
in
days
gone
by
but
now
good
sirs
take
pity
on
me
and
be
merciful
to
me
in
your
judgment
even
as
our
lord
would
be
merciful
and
all
that
heard
him
wept
save
only
the
judges
then
claes
asked
them
a
second
time
if
they
would
not
pardon
him
saying
truly
i
was
always
a
man
and
one
that
gained
little
for
all
his
toil
i
was
good
to
the
poor
and
kind
to
every
one
and
if
i
have
left
the
roman
church
it
is
only
in
obedience
to
the
spirit
of
god
that
spake
to
me
i
ask
for
no
grace
except
that
the
pain
of
fire
may
be
commuted
to
a
sentence
of
perpetual
banishment
from
the
land
of
flanders
banishment
for
life
a
sufficient
punishment
that
surely
and
all
they
that
were
present
cried
aloud
have
pity
upon
him
have
mercy
but
josse
grypstuiver
held
his
peace
now
the
bailiff
made
a
sign
to
the
company
that
they
should
keep
silence
adding
that
the
placards
contained
a
clause
which
expressly
forbade
the
petitioning
of
mercy
for
heretics
but
he
said
that
if
claes
would
abjure
his
heresy
he
should
be
executed
by
hanging
instead
of
by
burning
and
the
people
murmured
what
matters
burning
or
hanging
they
both
mean
death
and
the
women
wept
and
the
men
murmured
under
their
breath
claes
said
i
will
abjure
nothing
do
to
my
body
whatsoever
is
pleasing
to
your
mercy
then
spoke
the
dean
of
renaix
titelman
by
name
it
is
intolerable
that
these
vermin
of
heretics
should
raise
up
their
heads
in
this
way
before
their
judges
after
all
the
burning
of
the
body
is
but
a
passing
pain
and
torture
is
necessary
for
the
saving
of
souls
and
for
the
recantation
of
error
lest
the
people
be
given
the
dangerous
spectacle
of
heretics
dying
in
a
state
of
final
impenitence
at
these
words
the
women
wept
still
more
and
the
men
said
in
those
cases
where
the
crime
is
confessed
punishment
may
be
rightly
inflicted
but
torture
is
illegal
the
tribunal
decided
that
since
indeed
it
was
a
fact
that
the
ordinances
did
not
order
torture
to
be
applied
in
such
cases
there
was
no
occasion
to
insist
that
claes
should
suffer
it
he
was
asked
once
more
if
he
would
not
recant
i
can
not
he
answered
then
in
accordance
with
the
ordinances
sentence
was
passed
upon
him
he
was
declared
guilty
of
simony
in
that
he
had
taken
part
in
the
sale
of
indulgences
and
he
was
also
declared
to
be
a
heretic
and
a
harbourer
of
heretics
and
as
such
he
was
condemned
to
be
burned
alive
before
the
hoardings
of
the
town
hall
his
body
was
to
be
left
hanging
on
the
stake
for
the
space
of
two
days
as
a
warning
to
others
and
afterwards
it
was
to
be
interred
in
the
place
set
apart
for
the
bodies
of
executed
criminals
to
the
informer
josse
grypstuiver
whose
name
had
never
been
mentioned
throughout
the
whole
trial
the
tribunal
ordered
to
be
paid
the
sum
of
fifty
florins
calculated
on
the
first
hundred
florins
of
the
inheritance
of
the
deceased
and
a
tenth
part
of
the
remainder
when
he
heard
the
sentence
that
had
been
passed
upon
him
claes
turned
to
the
dean
of
the
fishmongers
you
will
come
to
a
bad
end
he
said
you
wicked
man
that
for
a
paltry
sum
of
money
have
turned
a
happy
wife
into
a
widow
and
a
joyous
son
into
a
grieving
orphan
the
judges
suffered
claes
to
speak
in
this
way
for
they
also
all
except
titelman
could
not
help
despising
from
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
the
dean
of
the
fishmongers
for
the
information
he
had
given
grypstuiver
himself
went
pale
with
shame
and
anger
and
claes
was
led
back
to
his
prison
xli
on
the
morrow
which
was
the
day
before
the
execution
of
claes
the
decision
of
the
court
was
made
known
to
nele
to
ulenspiegel
and
soetkin
they
asked
the
judges
for
leave
to
visit
claes
in
prison
which
permission
was
granted
in
the
case
of
the
wife
and
the
son
only
on
entering
the
prison
cell
they
found
claes
tied
to
the
wall
by
a
long
chain
a
small
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
because
of
the
damp
for
it
is
custom
and
law
in
flanders
that
they
who
are
condemned
to
death
shall
be
gently
treated
and
be
given
bread
and
meat
to
eat
or
cheese
and
wine
still
gaolers
are
a
greedy
race
and
oftentimes
the
law
is
broken
there
being
many
prison
guards
who
themselves
eat
up
the
greater
part
of
the
nourishment
provided
for
the
poor
prisoners
or
keep
the
best
morsels
for
themselves
claes
embraced
ulenspiegel
and
soetkin
crying
the
while
but
he
was
the
first
to
dry
his
eyes
for
he
put
control
upon
himself
being
a
man
and
the
head
of
the
family
soetkin
however
went
on
crying
and
ulenspiegel
kept
muttering
under
his
breath
i
must
break
these
wicked
chains
and
soetkin
said
through
her
tears
i
shall
go
to
king
philip
he
surely
will
have
mercy
but
claes
answered
that
this
would
be
no
use
since
the
king
was
wont
to
possess
himself
of
the
property
of
those
who
died
as
martyrs
he
said
also
my
wife
and
child
my
best
beloved
it
is
with
sadness
and
sorrow
that
i
am
about
to
leave
this
world
if
i
have
some
natural
apprehension
for
my
own
bodily
sufferings
i
am
no
less
concerned
when
i
think
of
you
and
of
how
poor
and
wretched
you
will
be
when
i
am
gone
for
the
king
will
certainly
seize
for
himself
all
your
goods
ulenspiegel
made
answer
speaking
in
a
low
voice
for
fear
of
being
overheard
yesterday
nele
and
i
hid
all
the
money
i
am
glad
claes
answered
the
informer
will
not
laugh
when
he
comes
to
count
his
plunder
i
had
rather
he
died
than
had
a
penny
of
it
said
soetkin
with
a
look
of
hate
in
her
eyes
now
dry
of
tears
but
claes
who
was
still
thinking
about
the
caroluses
said
to
ulenspiegel
that
was
clever
of
you
tyl
my
lad
now
soetkin
need
not
be
afraid
of
going
hungry
in
the
old
age
of
her
widowhood
and
claes
embraced
her
pressing
her
close
to
his
breast
and
she
wept
all
the
more
bitterly
as
she
thought
how
soon
she
was
to
lose
his
tender
protection
claes
looked
at
ulenspiegel
and
said
my
son
it
was
wrong
of
you
to
go
running
off
along
the
high
roads
of
the
world
like
any
ruffian
you
must
not
do
that
any
more
my
boy
you
must
not
leave
her
alone
at
home
my
widow
in
her
sorrow
for
now
it
is
your
duty
to
protect
her
and
take
care
of
her
you
a
man
i
will
father
said
ulenspiegel
o
my
poor
husband
cried
soetkin
embracing
him
again
what
crime
can
we
have
committed
nay
we
lived
our
life
peaceably
together
lowly
and
humbly
loving
each
other
well
how
well
thou
lord
knowest
early
in
the
morning
we
rose
for
work
and
at
eventide
rendering
our
thanks
to
thee
we
ate
our
daily
bread
oh
would
that
i
could
come
at
this
king
and
tear
him
with
my
nails
for
in
nothing
o
lord
god
have
we
offended
but
here
the
gaoler
entered
and
said
that
it
was
time
for
them
to
depart
soetkin
begged
to
be
allowed
to
stay
and
claes
felt
her
poor
face
burning
hot
as
it
touched
his
and
her
tears
falling
in
floods
and
wetting
all
his
cheek
and
her
poor
body
shaking
and
trembling
in
his
arms
he
too
entreated
the
gaoler
that
she
might
be
suffered
to
remain
with
him
but
the
gaoler
was
obdurate
and
removed
soetkin
by
force
from
the
arms
of
claes
take
care
of
her
claes
said
to
ulenspiegel
he
promised
and
son
and
mother
left
the
room
together
she
supported
in
his
arms
xlii
the
next
day
which
was
the
day
of
the
execution
the
neighbours
out
of
pity
for
their
suffering
came
and
shut
up
soetkin
and
nele
and
ulenspiegel
in
katheline
cottage
for
they
could
not
bear
that
they
should
see
the
terrible
sight
of
the
burning
yet
it
had
been
forgotten
that
the
cries
of
the
tormented
one
would
reach
the
cottage
and
that
those
within
would
be
able
to
see
through
the
windows
the
flames
of
the
fire
katheline
meanwhile
went
wandering
through
the
town
wagging
her
head
and
crying
out
continually
make
a
hole
make
a
hole
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
at
nine
of
the
clock
claes
was
led
out
of
his
prison
he
was
dressed
in
a
shirt
only
and
his
hands
were
tied
behind
his
back
in
accordance
with
the
sentence
that
had
been
passed
upon
him
the
pile
was
set
up
in
the
rue
notre
dame
with
a
stake
in
the
midst
just
in
front
of
the
hoarding
of
the
town
hall
when
they
arrived
there
the
executioner
and
his
assistants
had
not
yet
completed
the
work
of
stacking
the
wood
claes
stood
patiently
in
the
midst
of
his
tormentors
watching
while
the
work
was
finished
and
all
the
time
the
provost
on
his
horse
with
the
officers
of
the
tribunal
and
the
nine
that
had
been
summoned
from
bruges
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
order
among
the
people
for
they
murmured
one
to
another
saying
that
it
was
cruelty
thus
to
do
to
death
unjustly
a
man
like
claes
a
poor
man
and
already
old
in
years
and
one
that
was
so
gentle
so
forgiving
and
such
a
good
and
steady
workman
suddenly
they
all
fell
upon
their
knees
and
began
to
pray
for
the
bells
of
notre
dame
were
heard
tolling
for
the
dead
katheline
also
was
among
the
crowd
right
in
the
front
mad
as
she
was
fixing
her
eye
on
claes
and
the
pile
of
wood
she
wagged
her
head
and
cried
continually
fire
fire
dig
a
hole
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
when
nele
and
soetkin
heard
the
sound
of
the
tolling
they
crossed
themselves
but
ulenspiegel
did
not
cross
himself
saying
that
he
would
never
pray
to
god
after
the
same
fashion
as
those
hangmen
but
he
ran
about
the
cottage
trying
to
force
open
the
doors
or
jump
from
the
windows
but
they
were
shut
and
fastened
well
suddenly
soetkin
hid
her
face
in
her
apron
the
smoke
she
cried
and
in
very
fact
the
three
mourners
could
see
mounting
high
to
heaven
a
great
eddy
of
smoke
all
black
it
was
the
smoke
of
the
funeral
pile
whereon
was
claes
tied
to
a
stake
the
smoke
of
that
fire
which
the
executioner
had
just
set
burning
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
claes
looked
around
for
soetkin
or
ulenspiegel
but
not
seeing
them
anywhere
in
the
crowd
he
felt
happier
and
more
at
ease
thinking
that
they
would
not
know
how
he
suffered
and
all
the
time
there
was
a
silence
like
death
except
for
the
sound
of
claes
voice
praying
and
the
crackling
of
the
wood
the
murmuring
of
men
the
weeping
of
the
women
the
voice
of
katheline
as
she
cried
put
out
the
fire
make
a
hole
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
and
over
all
the
bells
of
notre
dame
tolling
for
the
dead
suddenly
soetkin
face
went
as
white
as
snow
and
her
body
trembled
all
over
she
did
not
utter
a
sound
but
pointed
to
the
sky
with
her
finger
for
there
a
long
straight
flame
of
fire
had
risen
above
the
pyre
and
now
was
leaping
high
above
the
roofs
of
the
lower
houses
it
was
a
flame
of
pain
and
cruelty
to
claes
for
following
the
caprice
of
the
breeze
it
preyed
upon
his
legs
or
touched
his
head
so
that
it
smoked
licking
and
singeing
his
hair
ulenspiegel
took
soetkin
in
his
arms
and
tried
to
tear
her
away
from
the
window
then
they
heard
a
sharp
cry
the
cry
which
came
from
claes
when
one
side
of
his
body
was
burnt
by
the
dancing
flames
but
then
he
was
silent
again
weeping
to
himself
and
his
breast
was
all
wet
with
his
tears
thereafter
soetkin
and
ulenspiegel
heard
a
great
noise
as
of
many
voices
this
was
the
townsfolk
their
wives
and
their
children
who
now
began
to
cry
and
shout
out
all
together
he
was
not
sentenced
to
be
burnt
by
a
slow
fire
but
by
a
quick
fire
executioner
stir
up
the
faggots
the
executioner
did
so
but
the
fire
did
not
flame
up
quick
enough
to
please
the
mob
kill
him
they
shouted
put
him
out
of
his
misery
and
they
began
to
throw
missiles
at
the
provost
soetkin
cried
aloud
the
flame
the
great
flame
and
in
very
truth
they
saw
now
a
great
red
flame
mounting
heavenwards
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
he
is
about
to
die
said
the
widow
o
lord
of
your
mercy
receive
the
soul
of
this
innocent
where
is
the
king
that
i
may
go
and
tear
out
his
heart
with
my
nails
and
all
the
while
the
bells
of
notre
dame
kept
tolling
for
the
dead
yet
again
did
soetkin
hear
a
great
cry
from
her
husband
but
mercifully
she
was
spared
the
sight
of
his
body
writhing
in
the
agony
of
the
fire
and
his
twisted
face
and
his
head
that
he
turned
from
side
to
side
and
beat
upon
the
wood
of
the
stake
meanwhile
the
crowd
continued
to
shout
and
to
hiss
and
the
boys
threw
stones
until
all
of
a
sudden
the
whole
pile
of
wood
caught
alight
and
the
voice
of
claes
was
heard
crying
out
from
the
midst
of
the
flame
and
smoke
soetkin
tyl
and
then
his
head
fell
down
upon
his
breast
as
though
it
were
made
of
lead
and
there
came
a
cry
most
piteous
and
piercing
from
the
cottage
of
katheline
and
after
that
there
was
silence
except
for
the
poor
mad
woman
wagging
her
head
and
saying
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
claes
was
dead
the
fire
burned
itself
away
smouldering
at
the
foot
of
the
stake
whereon
the
poor
body
still
hung
by
its
neck
and
the
bells
of
notre
dame
tolled
for
the
dead
xliii
in
katheline
cottage
soetkin
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
with
her
head
hanging
down
and
her
hands
clasped
together
she
held
ulenspiegel
in
her
arms
speechless
and
without
a
tear
neither
did
ulenspiegel
say
anything
it
made
him
afraid
to
feel
the
burning
fever
that
raged
in
the
body
of
his
mother
the
neighbours
returning
from
the
place
of
execution
came
to
the
cottage
and
told
how
claes
had
made
an
end
of
his
sufferings
he
is
in
glory
said
the
widow
pray
for
him
said
nele
putting
her
rosary
into
the
hands
of
ulenspiegel
but
he
would
make
no
use
of
it
giving
as
his
reason
that
the
beads
had
been
blessed
by
the
pope
at
last
night
came
and
ulenspiegel
urged
his
mother
to
go
to
bed
telling
her
that
he
himself
would
sit
up
and
keep
watch
in
the
room
but
soetkin
said
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
do
that
let
him
sleep
also
for
the
young
have
need
of
a
good
night
rest
so
nele
prepared
two
beds
for
them
in
the
kitchen
and
after
that
she
left
them
mother
and
son
stayed
up
together
while
what
remained
of
the
wood
fire
burned
itself
out
in
the
grate
then
soetkin
retired
to
her
bed
and
ulenspiegel
did
likewise
listening
to
his
mother
sobbing
to
herself
under
the
bedclothes
outside
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
wind
made
a
murmuring
sound
in
the
trees
by
the
canal
it
was
like
the
sound
of
waves
and
it
meant
that
autumn
was
coming
soon
also
there
were
great
eddies
of
dust
that
beat
against
the
cottage
windows
now
it
seemed
to
ulenspiegel
that
he
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
going
to
and
fro
in
the
room
and
he
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
and
going
in
the
kitchen
but
when
he
looked
he
no
longer
saw
the
man
and
listening
he
no
longer
heard
those
footsteps
but
only
the
sound
of
the
wind
as
it
whistled
in
the
chimney
and
soetkin
crying
under
the
bedclothes
then
once
again
he
heard
those
footsteps
and
just
behind
him
near
his
head
a
soft
sigh
who
is
it
he
said
no
one
answered
but
quite
distinctly
came
the
sound
of
three
taps
on
the
table
ulenspiegel
was
afraid
and
began
to
tremble
who
is
it
he
said
again
no
one
answered
but
once
more
there
came
the
three
taps
upon
the
table
and
after
that
he
felt
two
arms
hugging
him
round
and
over
him
there
leant
a
man
body
with
skin
all
wrinkled
and
a
great
hole
in
its
breast
that
gave
forth
a
smell
of
burning
father
said
ulenspiegel
is
it
you
and
is
this
your
poor
body
that
weighs
thus
upon
me
he
received
no
answer
to
his
question
and
although
the
shadow
seemed
still
quite
close
it
was
from
outside
the
cottage
that
he
heard
a
voice
crying
out
to
him
by
name
tyl
tyl
suddenly
soetkin
got
out
of
bed
and
came
over
to
where
ulenspiegel
was
lying
do
you
hear
something
she
said
yes
he
answered
it
is
father
calling
to
me
i
too
said
soetkin
i
have
felt
a
cold
body
beside
me
in
my
bed
and
the
mattress
has
moved
and
the
curtains
and
i
heard
a
voice
that
spoke
my
name
it
said
a
voice
soft
as
a
whisper
and
i
heard
a
step
near
by
light
as
the
sound
of
a
gnat
wings
then
she
addressed
herself
to
the
spirit
of
claes
if
there
is
aught
that
you
desire
in
that
heaven
where
god
guards
you
in
his
glory
you
must
tell
me
my
man
that
we
may
know
what
you
would
have
us
do
all
of
a
sudden
a
mighty
gust
of
wind
came
blowing
upon
the
door
and
it
burst
wide
open
and
straightway
the
room
was
filled
with
dust
and
from
afar
soetkin
and
ulenspiegel
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
cawing
of
many
ravens
they
went
out
of
the
cottage
and
came
together
to
the
place
of
torture
it
was
a
black
night
save
where
the
clouds
coursing
in
the
sky
like
stags
before
the
keen
north
wind
were
parted
here
and
there
so
as
to
disclose
the
glittering
face
of
some
star
by
the
remnants
of
the
pile
strode
a
sergeant
of
the
commune
up
and
down
keeping
guard
soetkin
and
ulenspiegel
heard
his
steps
as
they
resounded
on
the
hardened
ground
and
together
with
that
sound
there
came
the
cry
of
a
raven
calling
his
fellows
doubtless
for
from
far
away
there
came
the
sound
of
other
caws
in
answer
as
soetkin
and
ulenspiegel
approached
the
pile
the
raven
swooped
down
upon
the
shoulder
of
claes
and
they
could
hear
its
beak
pecking
upon
the
body
and
soon
the
other
ravens
followed
ulenspiegel
would
have
thrown
himself
upon
the
pile
and
beaten
them
off
had
not
the
sergeant
come
up
and
prevented
him
are
you
a
sorcerer
cried
the
man
that
comes
hither
for
the
hands
of
the
dead
as
a
talisman
and
yet
do
you
not
know
that
the
hands
of
a
man
that
has
been
burnt
to
death
possess
no
power
of
invisibility
but
only
hands
of
one
who
has
been
hanged
such
as
you
yourself
will
be
one
of
these
days
sir
ulenspiegel
replied
i
am
no
sorcerer
but
the
orphaned
son
of
the
man
tied
to
this
stake
here
and
this
woman
is
the
dead
widow
we
only
wish
to
kiss
him
once
again
and
to
take
away
a
few
of
his
ashes
in
his
memory
give
us
leave
sir
pray
for
you
are
certainly
no
foreign
soldier
but
a
son
of
this
land
very
well
said
the
sergeant
so
the
orphan
and
the
widow
made
their
way
over
the
charred
wood
and
approached
the
body
weeping
they
both
kissed
the
face
of
claes
then
ulenspiegel
found
the
place
where
the
heart
had
been
a
great
hole
hollowed
out
by
the
flames
and
therefrom
he
took
a
few
ashes
then
soetkin
and
he
knelt
down
and
said
a
prayer
and
when
the
sky
began
to
turn
pale
in
the
dawn
they
were
still
kneeling
there
together
but
the
sergeant
drove
them
off
for
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
be
punished
for
his
kindness
when
they
were
home
again
soetkin
took
a
piece
of
red
silk
and
a
piece
of
black
silk
and
she
made
a
little
bag
to
contain
the
ashes
and
on
the
little
bag
she
sewed
two
ribbons
so
that
ulenspiegel
could
always
carry
it
suspended
round
his
neck
and
she
gave
it
to
him
with
these
words
these
ashes
are
the
heart
of
my
husband
this
red
ribbon
is
his
blood
this
black
one
is
our
sorrow
always
upon
your
breast
let
them
lie
and
call
down
thereby
the
fire
of
vengeance
upon
his
torturers
amen
said
ulenspiegel
and
the
widow
embraced
her
orphan
and
the
sun
rose
xliv
in
that
year
being
the
year
of
the
century
katheline
came
into
soetkin
house
and
spake
as
follows
last
night
being
anointed
with
balm
i
was
transported
to
the
tower
of
notre
dame
and
i
beheld
the
elemental
spirits
that
carry
the
prayers
of
men
to
the
angels
and
they
in
their
turn
flying
up
towards
the
highest
heaven
bring
them
to
the
throne
of
god
and
everywhere
the
sky
was
strewn
with
glittering
stars
suddenly
i
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
that
seemed
all
blackened
and
charred
rising
from
a
funeral
pile
mounting
up
towards
me
this
figure
took
its
place
beside
me
on
the
tower
i
saw
that
it
was
claes
just
as
he
was
in
life
dressed
in
his
clothes
he
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
there
on
the
tower
of
notre
dame
you
i
asked
in
my
turn
are
you
off
to
flying
in
the
air
like
a
bird
am
going
he
answered
judgment
hear
you
not
the
angel
trump
that
summons
me
i
was
quite
close
to
him
and
could
feel
the
very
substance
of
his
spiritual
body
not
hard
and
resisting
to
the
touch
like
the
bodies
of
those
that
are
alive
but
so
rarefied
that
to
come
up
against
it
was
like
advancing
into
a
kind
of
warm
mist
and
at
my
feet
stretched
out
on
every
side
the
land
of
flanders
with
a
few
lights
shining
here
and
there
and
i
said
to
myself
that
rise
early
and
work
late
surely
they
are
the
blessed
of
god
and
all
the
time
i
could
hear
the
angel
trumpet
calling
through
the
night
and
presently
i
saw
another
shade
mounting
up
towards
me
from
the
land
of
spain
this
was
an
old
man
and
decrepit
with
a
protruding
chin
and
quince
jam
all
oozing
from
the
corners
of
his
lips
on
its
back
it
wore
a
cloak
of
crimson
velvet
lined
with
ermine
and
on
its
head
an
imperial
crown
and
it
kept
nibbling
a
piece
of
anchovy
which
it
carried
in
one
hand
while
in
the
other
hand
it
clutched
a
tankard
of
beer
i
could
see
that
this
spirit
was
tired
out
and
had
come
to
the
tower
of
notre
dame
to
rest
itself
kneeling
down
i
addressed
it
in
these
words
imperial
majesty
of
a
truth
i
revere
you
yet
i
know
not
who
you
are
whence
come
you
and
what
was
your
position
in
the
world
come
answered
the
shade
saint
juste
in
the
country
of
estramadoure
i
was
the
emperor
charles
the
fifth
said
i
pray
are
you
going
on
such
a
cold
night
as
this
and
over
these
clouds
that
are
all
heavy
and
charged
with
hail
go
answered
the
shade
judgment
just
as
the
emperor
was
about
to
finish
his
anchovy
and
drink
up
his
tankard
of
beer
the
angel
trumpet
sounded
and
straightway
he
had
to
betake
himself
to
the
air
again
grumbling
at
this
sudden
interruption
of
his
repast
high
aloft
he
mounted
through
space
i
following
close
behind
and
as
he
went
he
hiccuped
with
fatigue
and
coughed
asthmatically
even
vomited
now
and
again
for
death
had
come
upon
him
at
a
time
when
he
was
suffering
from
a
fit
of
indigestion
thus
ceaselessly
we
soared
aloft
like
arrows
shot
from
a
bow
of
the
stars
glimmered
all
around
us
and
time
and
again
we
saw
them
detach
themselves
and
fall
headlong
tracing
long
strokes
of
fire
upon
the
sky
once
more
the
angel
trump
resounded
very
shrill
and
powerful
each
fanfare
seemed
to
cleave
for
itself
a
pathway
through
the
cloudy
air
scattering
the
mists
asunder
like
a
hurricane
that
has
begun
to
blow
from
near
at
hand
and
by
this
means
our
track
was
marked
out
clearly
for
us
till
at
length
when
we
had
been
carried
up
and
up
a
thousand
leagues
and
more
we
beheld
christ
himself
in
his
glory
seated
upon
a
throne
of
stars
and
at
his
right
hand
was
the
angel
who
records
the
deeds
of
men
upon
a
register
of
brass
and
at
his
left
hand
stood
mary
his
mother
she
that
for
ever
implores
mercy
for
poor
sinners
claes
and
the
emperor
knelt
down
together
before
the
throne
and
the
angel
took
off
the
crown
from
the
head
of
the
emperor
and
cast
it
away
is
only
one
emperor
here
he
said
it
is
his
sacred
majesty
could
not
conceal
his
annoyance
yet
managed
to
assume
a
humble
tone
of
voice
as
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
keep
his
anchovy
and
his
tankard
of
beer
for
that
he
had
come
a
long
way
and
was
very
hungry
you
have
been
all
your
life
said
the
angel
you
may
go
on
with
your
eating
and
drinking
if
you
want
to
the
emperor
emptied
the
tankard
of
beer
and
took
a
nibble
at
the
anchovy
then
christ
addressed
him
with
these
words
you
present
yourself
to
judgment
with
a
clean
soul
trust
so
dear
lord
answered
charles
the
emperor
i
have
confessed
my
sins
and
am
well
shriven
you
claes
you
do
not
seem
to
be
trembling
like
the
emperor
lord
jesus
answered
claes
is
no
soul
that
is
clean
and
how
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
you
that
are
sovereign
good
and
sovereign
justice
nevertheless
i
am
afraid
of
my
sins
for
they
are
many
carrion
said
the
angel
addressing
himself
to
the
emperor
lord
said
charles
in
an
embarrassed
tone
of
voice
am
he
that
was
anointed
with
oil
by
your
priests
and
crowned
king
of
castile
emperor
of
germany
and
king
of
the
romans
it
has
ever
been
my
first
care
to
maintain
that
power
which
was
given
me
by
you
and
to
that
end
i
have
done
my
best
by
hanging
and
by
sword
by
burning
and
by
burying
alive
by
pit
and
by
fire
to
keep
down
all
reformers
and
protestants
but
the
angel
said
you
false
and
dyspeptic
man
you
are
trying
to
deceive
us
in
germany
forsooth
you
were
tolerant
enough
of
the
protestants
seeing
that
there
you
had
good
cause
to
be
afraid
of
them
but
in
the
netherlands
you
beheaded
burned
hanged
and
buried
them
alive
for
there
your
only
fear
was
lest
you
might
fail
to
inherit
sufficient
of
their
property
so
rich
and
plenteous
like
the
honey
made
by
busy
bees
and
there
perished
at
your
hands
one
hundred
thousand
souls
not
at
all
because
you
loved
the
lord
christ
but
because
you
were
a
despot
a
tyrant
a
waster
of
your
country
and
one
that
loved
himself
first
of
all
and
after
that
nothing
but
meat
fish
wine
and
beer
for
you
were
always
as
greedy
as
a
dog
and
as
thirsty
as
a
sponge
when
the
angel
had
made
an
end
christ
commanded
that
claes
should
speak
but
now
the
angel
rose
from
his
place
saying
man
has
nothing
to
answer
he
was
a
good
man
as
are
all
the
poor
people
of
flanders
willing
either
for
work
or
play
one
that
kept
faith
with
his
masters
and
trusted
his
masters
to
keep
faith
with
him
but
he
possessed
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
an
accusation
was
brought
against
him
and
inasmuch
as
he
had
harboured
in
his
house
a
heretic
he
was
condemned
to
be
burnt
alive
cried
mary
poor
martyr
but
here
in
heaven
there
are
springs
of
fresh
water
fountains
of
milk
and
exquisite
wine
which
will
refresh
you
and
i
myself
will
lead
you
there
good
and
now
the
angel
trumpet
sounded
yet
again
and
i
saw
a
man
naked
and
very
beautiful
rising
from
the
abyss
on
his
head
was
an
iron
crown
and
on
the
rim
of
the
crown
these
words
inscribed
till
the
day
of
judgment
he
approached
the
throne
and
said
to
christ
slave
i
am
until
that
day
when
i
shall
be
thy
master
satan
said
mary
day
will
come
when
there
shall
be
neither
slave
nor
master
any
more
and
when
christ
who
is
love
and
satan
who
is
pride
shall
stand
forth
together
as
the
one
lord
both
of
power
and
of
knowledge
said
satan
art
all
goodness
and
all
beauty
then
addressing
himself
to
christ
and
pointing
at
the
same
time
towards
the
emperor
satan
demanded
what
was
to
be
done
with
him
christ
answered
this
crowned
wormling
and
put
him
in
a
room
wherein
you
have
collected
together
all
instruments
of
torture
which
were
in
use
under
his
rule
and
each
time
that
some
innocent
wretch
is
made
to
suffer
the
torture
of
water
whereby
the
bodies
of
men
swell
up
like
bladders
or
the
torture
of
the
candles
whereby
the
soles
of
their
feet
or
their
armpits
are
burned
and
scorched
or
the
torture
of
the
strappado
whereby
their
limbs
are
broken
or
the
torture
of
the
four
wagons
that
drags
them
asunder
and
every
time
that
a
free
soul
breathes
out
its
last
upon
the
funeral
pile
let
this
man
also
endure
in
his
turn
these
same
deaths
and
tortures
to
the
end
that
he
may
learn
in
his
own
person
what
evil
may
be
wrought
in
the
world
by
an
unjust
man
who
has
power
over
his
fellows
let
him
languish
in
prison
let
him
meet
death
upon
the
scaffold
let
him
mourn
in
exile
far
from
his
native
land
let
him
be
scorned
abused
and
flogged
with
many
whips
let
him
know
what
it
is
to
be
rich
and
see
all
his
property
eaten
up
by
the
let
him
be
accused
by
informers
and
ruined
by
confiscations
turn
him
into
an
ass
that
he
may
know
what
it
is
to
be
gentle
by
nature
and
at
the
same
time
and
badly
fed
let
him
be
a
poor
man
that
asks
for
alms
and
is
answered
only
with
abuse
let
him
be
a
workman
that
labours
too
long
and
eats
too
little
and
then
when
he
has
thus
well
suffered
both
in
his
body
and
his
soul
turn
him
into
a
dog
that
he
may
be
beaten
an
indian
slave
that
he
may
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
a
soldier
that
he
may
fight
for
another
and
be
killed
without
knowing
why
and
then
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
years
when
he
has
exhausted
all
sufferings
and
all
miseries
make
a
free
man
of
him
and
if
in
that
state
of
life
he
is
good
like
claes
here
you
may
lay
at
last
his
body
to
rest
in
some
quiet
corner
of
earth
that
is
shady
in
the
noonday
heat
and
open
to
the
morning
sun
and
there
beneath
a
beautiful
tree
and
covered
with
fresh
sward
he
shall
find
eternal
repose
and
his
friends
shall
come
to
his
grave
to
moisten
it
with
their
tears
and
to
sow
violets
there
which
are
called
the
flowers
of
remembrance
but
mary
said
mercy
upon
him
o
my
son
he
knew
not
what
he
did
and
we
know
how
power
hardens
the
heart
is
no
mercy
for
him
said
christ
cried
his
sacred
majesty
is
me
would
that
i
had
but
a
single
glass
of
andalusian
wine
said
satan
is
past
the
time
for
wine
or
meat
or
poultry
and
away
he
carried
off
the
soul
of
the
poor
emperor
down
to
the
nethermost
hell
still
nibbling
as
he
went
his
piece
of
anchovy
for
this
satan
suffered
him
to
do
out
of
pity
thereafter
i
saw
that
our
lady
conducted
claes
away
and
up
into
the
highest
heaven
where
is
nothing
but
stars
hanging
from
the
roof
like
clusters
of
grapes
and
there
the
angels
washed
him
clean
and
he
became
all
beautiful
and
young
and
they
gave
him
rystpap
to
drink
in
silver
ladles
and
then
the
heavens
closed
claes
is
in
glory
said
the
widow
his
ashes
beat
against
my
heart
said
ulenspiegel
xlv
during
all
the
three
and
twenty
days
that
followed
katheline
grew
paler
and
paler
and
thin
and
all
dried
up
as
though
devoured
not
only
by
the
madness
that
consumed
her
but
by
some
interior
fire
that
was
even
deadlier
still
no
more
did
she
cry
out
as
of
old
fire
fire
dig
a
hole
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
but
she
was
continually
transported
into
a
kind
of
ecstasy
in
which
she
spake
to
nele
many
strange
words
a
wife
i
am
she
said
and
a
wife
you
also
ought
to
be
my
husband
is
a
handsome
man
a
hairy
man
is
he
hot
with
love
but
his
knees
and
his
arms
they
are
cold
and
soetkin
looked
at
her
sadly
wondering
what
new
kind
of
madness
this
might
be
but
katheline
continued
three
times
three
are
nine
the
sacred
number
he
whose
eyes
glitter
in
the
night
like
the
eyes
of
a
cat
he
only
it
is
that
sees
the
mystery
one
evening
when
katheline
was
talking
in
this
way
soetkin
made
a
gesture
of
misgiving
but
katheline
said
under
saturn
four
and
three
mean
misfortune
but
under
venus
it
is
the
marriage
number
cold
arms
cold
knees
heart
of
fire
soetkin
answered
it
is
wrong
to
talk
in
this
way
of
these
wicked
pagan
idols
but
katheline
only
crossed
herself
and
said
blessed
be
the
grey
horseman
nele
must
have
a
husband
a
handsome
husband
that
carries
a
sword
a
dusky
husband
with
a
shining
face
yes
cried
ulenspiegel
a
very
fricassee
of
a
husband
for
whom
i
will
make
a
sauce
with
my
knife
nele
looked
at
her
lover
with
eyes
that
were
moist
with
pleasure
to
see
him
so
jealous
none
of
your
husbands
for
me
she
said
but
katheline
made
answer
when
cometh
he
he
that
is
clad
in
grey
and
booted
and
spurred
soetkin
bade
them
say
a
prayer
to
god
for
the
poor
afflicted
one
whereupon
katheline
in
her
madness
ordered
ulenspiegel
go
and
fetch
four
quarts
of
dobbel
kuyt
what
time
she
made
ready
some
as
pancakes
are
called
in
flanders
soetkin
asked
her
why
she
wished
to
make
festival
on
a
saturday
like
the
jews
because
the
butter
is
ready
said
katheline
so
ulenspiegel
stood
up
and
took
in
his
hand
the
big
pot
of
english
pewter
that
held
just
four
quarts
mother
he
asked
what
shall
i
do
go
said
katheline
soetkin
did
not
like
to
say
anything
more
for
she
was
not
mistress
of
the
house
so
she
told
her
son
to
go
and
do
as
katheline
had
bidden
him
ulenspiegel
ran
to
the
tavern
and
brought
back
with
him
the
four
quarts
of
dobbel
kuyt
and
soon
the
kitchen
reeked
with
the
good
smell
of
pancakes
and
every
one
felt
hungry
even
the
poor
afflicted
katheline
ulenspiegel
ate
heartily
and
drank
heartily
also
for
katheline
had
given
him
a
full
tankard
saying
with
a
malicious
look
that
it
behoved
him
to
drink
more
than
the
others
seeing
that
he
was
the
only
male
and
the
head
of
the
house
afterwards
she
asked
him
to
give
them
a
song
but
ulenspiegel
did
not
sing
and
nele
was
all
tearful
seeing
soetkin
so
pale
and
as
it
were
all
sunken
into
herself
katheline
alone
of
them
all
appeared
to
be
happy
when
the
meal
was
over
soetkin
and
ulenspiegel
went
up
into
the
loft
to
bed
katheline
and
nele
stayed
behind
for
they
slept
together
in
the
kitchen
all
was
quiet
until
the
second
hour
after
midnight
ulenspiegel
had
already
been
asleep
for
a
long
time
because
of
all
the
beer
he
had
been
drinking
but
soetkin
as
her
custom
was
lay
on
with
eyes
wide
open
praying
our
lady
to
send
her
sleep
but
with
no
avail
all
of
a
sudden
she
heard
the
cry
of
a
and
from
the
kitchen
came
a
like
cry
in
answer
then
from
far
off
in
the
country
somewhere
other
cries
resounded
always
as
it
seemed
in
answer
to
that
cry
in
the
kitchen
just
below
soetkin
tried
to
think
it
was
only
the
calling
to
one
another
and
endeavoured
to
distract
her
attention
from
those
sounds
but
presently
she
heard
a
neighing
of
horses
and
a
noise
as
of
iron
sabots
beating
along
the
high
road
then
it
was
that
she
opened
the
window
of
the
loft
and
saw
that
in
very
fact
there
were
a
couple
of
horses
saddled
just
outside
the
cottage
pawing
the
ground
and
nibbling
the
grass
that
grew
by
the
side
of
the
road
thereafter
she
heard
the
voice
of
a
woman
crying
out
in
fear
and
a
man
voice
threatening
followed
by
the
sound
of
blows
more
cries
a
door
shutting
with
a
bang
and
then
steps
running
up
the
ladder
in
mortal
fear
all
this
time
ulenspiegel
was
snoring
away
in
his
bed
hearing
nothing
till
the
door
of
the
loft
opened
and
nele
came
in
out
of
breath
sobbing
and
with
scarcely
anything
on
as
hastily
as
she
could
the
girl
dragged
against
the
door
a
table
some
chairs
an
old
heating
stove
any
bit
of
furniture
that
was
to
hand
with
these
she
made
a
barricade
meanwhile
outside
the
last
stars
were
paling
in
the
heavens
and
the
cocks
beginning
to
crow
ulenspiegel
had
turned
over
in
his
bed
at
the
noise
nele
was
making
but
now
he
had
gone
to
sleep
again
nele
meanwhile
had
thrown
herself
on
to
soetkin
neck
soetkin
she
said
i
am
afraid
light
the
candle
do
soetkin
did
so
and
all
the
time
nele
never
left
off
moaning
by
the
light
of
the
candle
soetkin
looked
the
girl
up
and
down
her
shift
was
torn
at
the
shoulder
and
in
front
and
there
were
traces
of
blood
upon
her
neck
and
cheek
such
as
might
be
left
by
the
scratch
of
a
whence
have
you
come
and
what
are
these
wounds
soetkin
asked
her
trembling
and
groaning
all
the
time
the
girl
made
answer
for
mercy
sake
soetkin
do
not
bring
us
to
the
stake
ulenspiegel
meanwhile
had
awakened
from
his
sleep
and
was
blinking
his
eyes
in
the
sudden
light
of
the
candle
soetkin
said
who
is
it
down
there
not
so
loud
nele
whispered
it
is
the
husband
katheline
desired
for
me
all
at
once
soetkin
and
nele
heard
katheline
cry
out
in
a
loud
voice
and
their
legs
gave
way
beneath
them
in
their
terror
he
is
beating
her
said
nele
he
is
beating
her
because
of
me
who
is
it
in
the
house
cried
ulenspiegel
jumping
out
of
bed
and
then
rubbing
his
eyes
he
went
stalking
up
and
down
the
room
till
at
last
he
found
a
heavy
poker
that
stood
in
the
corner
he
took
hold
of
it
but
nele
tried
to
dissuade
him
telling
him
that
there
was
no
one
there
but
he
paid
no
attention
running
to
the
door
and
throwing
to
one
side
the
chairs
and
tables
and
the
stove
that
nele
had
piled
up
in
front
of
it
all
this
time
katheline
was
crying
out
from
the
kitchen
and
nele
and
soetkin
held
ulenspiegel
the
one
by
the
waist
the
other
by
the
legs
and
tried
to
prevent
him
from
descending
the
stairs
do
go
down
they
told
him
do
go
down
ulenspiegel
there
are
devils
down
there
forsooth
says
he
nele
him
verily
will
i
join
in
marriage
to
this
long
poker
of
mine
a
marriage
of
iron
and
flesh
let
me
go
but
they
did
not
loose
their
hold
hanging
on
as
they
were
to
the
landing
rail
and
all
the
time
ulenspiegel
was
trying
to
drag
them
down
the
staircase
and
they
the
more
frightened
as
they
came
nearer
to
the
devils
below
and
they
could
avail
naught
against
him
so
that
at
last
descending
now
by
leaps
and
bounds
like
a
snowball
that
falls
from
the
top
of
a
mountain
he
came
into
the
kitchen
and
there
was
katheline
all
exhausted
and
pale
in
the
light
of
dawn
hanske
she
was
saying
o
hanske
why
must
you
leave
me
is
it
my
fault
if
nele
is
naughty
ulenspiegel
did
not
take
any
notice
of
her
but
straightway
opened
the
door
of
the
shed
and
finding
no
one
there
rushed
out
into
the
yard
and
thence
into
the
high
road
far
away
he
descried
two
horses
galloping
off
and
disappearing
in
the
mist
he
ran
after
them
hoping
to
overtake
them
but
he
could
not
for
they
went
like
a
south
wind
that
scours
the
dry
autumn
leaves
ulenspiegel
was
angry
with
disappointment
and
he
came
back
into
the
cottage
grieving
sore
in
his
heart
and
muttering
between
his
teeth
they
have
done
their
worst
on
her
they
have
done
their
worst
and
he
looked
on
nele
with
eyes
that
burned
with
an
evil
flame
but
nele
all
trembling
stood
up
before
katheline
and
the
widow
no
she
cried
no
tyl
my
lover
no
and
as
she
spoke
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
so
sadly
and
so
frankly
that
ulenspiegel
saw
clearly
that
what
she
said
was
true
then
he
spake
again
and
questioned
her
but
whence
came
those
cries
and
whither
went
those
men
why
is
your
shift
all
torn
on
the
shoulder
and
the
back
and
why
do
you
bear
on
forehead
and
cheek
these
marks
of
a
man
nails
i
will
tell
you
she
said
but
be
careful
that
you
do
not
have
us
burned
at
the
stake
for
what
i
shall
tell
you
you
must
know
that
katheline
whom
god
save
from
hell
hath
had
these
days
a
devil
for
her
lover
he
is
dressed
all
in
black
he
is
booted
and
spurred
his
face
gleams
with
a
flame
of
fire
like
what
one
sees
in
when
it
is
hot
on
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
katheline
whimpered
why
oh
why
have
you
left
me
hanske
my
pet
nele
is
naughty
but
nele
went
on
with
her
story
the
devil
announces
his
approach
in
a
voice
that
is
like
the
crying
of
a
every
saturday
my
mother
receives
him
in
the
kitchen
and
she
says
that
his
kisses
are
cold
and
that
his
body
is
like
snow
one
time
he
brought
her
some
florins
but
he
took
from
her
all
the
other
money
that
she
had
all
this
time
soetkin
kept
on
praying
for
katheline
with
clasped
hands
but
katheline
spake
joyfully
my
body
is
mine
no
more
my
mind
is
mine
no
more
o
hanske
my
pet
take
me
with
you
yet
once
again
i
beg
you
to
the
sabbath
only
nele
will
never
come
nele
is
naughty
i
tell
you
but
nele
went
on
with
her
story
at
dawn
she
said
the
devil
would
go
away
and
the
next
day
my
mother
would
relate
to
me
a
hundred
strange
things
but
tyl
dear
you
must
not
look
at
me
with
those
cruel
eyes
yesterday
for
instance
she
told
me
that
a
splendid
prince
clad
in
grey
hilbert
by
name
was
anxious
to
take
me
in
marriage
and
that
he
was
coming
here
himself
that
i
might
see
him
i
told
her
that
i
wanted
no
husband
handsome
or
plain
nevertheless
by
weight
of
her
maternal
authority
she
persuaded
me
to
stay
up
for
him
for
she
certainly
keeps
all
her
wits
about
her
in
whatever
pertains
to
her
amours
well
we
were
half
undressed
ready
to
go
to
bed
and
i
had
gone
off
to
sleep
sitting
on
that
chair
it
seems
that
i
did
not
wake
up
when
they
came
in
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
was
that
some
one
was
embracing
me
and
kissing
me
on
the
neck
and
then
by
the
bright
light
of
the
moon
i
beheld
a
face
that
shone
like
the
crests
of
the
waves
of
a
july
sea
when
there
is
thunder
in
the
air
and
i
heard
a
low
voice
speaking
to
me
and
saying
am
your
husband
hilbert
be
mine
i
will
make
thee
rich
and
from
the
face
of
him
that
spake
these
words
there
came
an
odour
like
the
odour
of
fish
quickly
i
pushed
that
face
away
from
me
but
the
man
tried
to
take
me
by
force
and
although
i
had
the
strength
of
ten
against
him
he
managed
to
tear
my
shift
and
scratch
my
face
crying
out
the
while
that
if
only
i
would
give
myself
to
him
he
would
make
me
rich
i
answered
rich
as
my
mother
whom
you
have
deprived
of
her
last
liard
at
that
he
redoubled
his
violence
but
he
could
not
do
anything
against
me
and
at
last
since
he
was
more
disgusting
than
a
corpse
i
scratched
him
in
the
eye
with
my
nails
so
sharply
that
he
cried
out
with
pain
and
i
was
able
to
make
my
escape
and
run
up
here
to
soetkin
and
all
this
while
katheline
kept
on
with
her
nele
is
naughty
and
why
did
you
go
away
so
soon
o
hanske
my
pet
but
soetkin
asked
her
where
she
had
been
while
wicked
men
were
attempting
the
honour
of
her
child
it
is
nele
that
is
naughty
katheline
replied
as
for
me
i
was
in
company
of
my
black
master
when
the
devil
in
grey
comes
to
us
with
his
face
all
bloody
away
he
cries
away
my
boy
this
is
an
evil
house
for
the
men
it
seems
are
of
a
mind
to
fight
with
one
to
the
death
and
the
women
carry
knives
at
the
tips
of
their
fingers
and
there
and
then
they
ran
off
to
their
horses
and
disappeared
in
the
mist
ah
nele
nele
she
is
a
naughty
lass
i
tell
you
xlvi
on
the
following
day
while
they
were
making
a
meal
of
hot
milk
soetkin
said
to
katheline
you
see
how
misfortune
is
already
driving
me
from
this
world
and
yet
you
it
seems
would
like
to
drive
me
away
all
the
faster
by
your
accursed
sorceries
but
katheline
only
went
on
repeating
nele
is
naughty
come
back
hanske
my
pet
it
was
the
following
wednesday
when
the
two
devils
came
again
ever
since
the
preceding
saturday
nele
had
slept
out
at
the
house
of
a
widow
woman
named
van
den
houte
saying
by
way
of
excusing
herself
that
she
could
not
stay
with
katheline
because
of
that
young
rogue
ulenspiegel
now
katheline
welcomed
her
black
master
and
her
master
friend
out
in
the
keet
which
is
to
say
the
laundry
or
bakehouse
adjoining
the
cottage
and
there
did
they
feast
and
regale
themselves
with
old
wine
and
with
smoked
ox
tongue
which
viands
were
always
prepared
and
ready
in
that
place
for
them
and
the
black
devil
said
to
katheline
you
must
know
katheline
that
we
are
engaged
in
a
mighty
work
and
to
accomplish
it
we
have
need
of
a
large
sum
of
money
give
us
i
pray
you
what
you
can
when
she
only
offered
them
a
florin
they
threatened
to
kill
her
but
when
she
had
raised
the
amount
to
a
couple
of
golden
caroluses
and
seven
deniers
they
let
her
off
come
not
again
on
saturdays
she
told
them
for
ulenspiegel
has
discovered
that
your
custom
it
is
to
come
on
that
day
and
he
will
certainly
be
waiting
for
you
and
will
beat
you
to
death
and
that
would
be
the
death
of
me
as
well
we
will
come
next
tuesday
they
told
her
now
on
that
day
nele
and
ulenspiegel
went
to
sleep
without
any
anxiety
thinking
that
the
devils
only
came
to
the
cottage
on
saturdays
but
katheline
got
out
of
bed
secretly
and
went
into
the
yard
to
see
if
her
friends
had
arrived
she
was
very
impatient
for
since
seeing
hanske
again
her
madness
had
abated
for
hers
was
a
lover
madness
as
they
say
but
she
could
nowhere
see
her
friends
and
she
was
greatly
distressed
so
that
when
presently
she
heard
the
cry
of
the
coming
as
it
seemed
from
the
open
country
in
the
direction
of
sluys
she
went
out
towards
that
cry
making
her
way
across
the
field
by
the
side
of
a
tall
dike
that
was
constructed
of
sticks
and
grass
she
had
not
gone
far
when
she
heard
the
two
devils
conversing
together
at
the
other
side
of
the
dike
and
one
of
them
said
half
shall
be
mine
and
the
other
answered
no
nothing
of
the
kind
what
is
katheline
belongs
to
me
all
of
it
then
they
blasphemed
together
most
terribly
disputing
as
to
which
of
the
two
should
be
possessed
of
the
property
and
the
love
of
katheline
and
of
nele
into
the
bargain
paralysed
with
fear
daring
neither
to
speak
nor
to
move
katheline
presently
heard
them
fall
to
fighting
with
one
another
and
then
one
of
the
devils
cried
aloud
ah
the
cold
steel
and
after
that
there
came
the
sound
of
a
and
of
a
body
falling
heavily
terrified
as
she
was
katheline
returned
to
the
cottage
at
two
of
the
morning
she
heard
once
more
the
cry
of
the
but
this
time
close
at
hand
in
the
yard
she
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
saw
her
devil
lover
standing
there
all
alone
she
asked
him
what
he
had
done
with
his
friend
he
will
not
come
again
he
told
her
then
he
kissed
her
and
caressed
her
and
his
kisses
seemed
colder
than
ever
before
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
depart
he
asked
her
to
give
him
twenty
florins
this
was
all
that
she
had
but
she
gave
him
seventeen
the
next
day
she
could
not
control
her
curiosity
and
walked
out
along
by
the
dike
but
she
found
nothing
except
at
one
place
a
mark
on
the
grass
about
the
size
of
a
man
coffin
and
the
grass
was
wet
underfoot
and
red
with
blood
but
that
evening
rain
fell
washing
the
blood
away
on
the
following
wednesday
katheline
heard
yet
again
the
cry
of
the
in
the
yard
xlvii
now
whenever
any
money
was
needed
to
pay
for
the
expenses
of
katheline
household
ulenspiegel
was
accustomed
to
go
by
night
to
the
hole
by
the
well
wherein
had
been
hidden
the
money
left
by
claes
he
would
lift
up
the
stone
that
covered
the
top
of
the
well
and
would
take
out
a
carolus
one
evening
the
two
women
were
busy
with
their
spinning
while
ulenspiegel
sat
carving
a
chest
which
had
been
commissioned
from
him
by
the
town
bailiff
and
upon
the
side
of
the
chest
he
was
carving
a
hunting
scene
very
beautiful
it
was
and
cleverly
carved
with
a
pack
of
hounds
running
in
pairs
closely
following
one
another
chasing
their
quarry
katheline
was
there
and
nele
asked
soetkin
if
she
had
found
a
safe
for
her
treasure
thinking
no
harm
the
widow
answered
that
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
safer
place
than
the
side
of
the
well
wall
near
midnight
of
the
following
thursday
soetkin
was
awakened
by
bibulus
schnouffius
who
was
barking
fiercely
but
soon
he
was
quiet
again
and
soetkin
thinking
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
the
next
day
when
nele
and
ulenspiegel
rose
at
dawn
they
were
surprised
to
find
no
katheline
in
the
kitchen
neither
was
the
fire
lit
nor
was
there
any
milk
boiling
on
the
fire
as
usual
they
were
surprised
at
this
and
went
out
to
see
if
perchance
she
was
in
the
yard
and
there
they
found
her
all
dishevelled
in
her
linen
shift
notwithstanding
that
it
was
drizzling
with
rain
and
she
was
all
damp
and
shivering
and
stood
there
not
daring
to
come
in
ulenspiegel
went
up
to
her
and
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
half
naked
there
in
the
rain
ah
she
said
yes
yes
strange
things
have
happened
strange
wonderful
things
and
as
she
spoke
she
pointed
to
the
ground
and
they
saw
the
dog
lying
there
with
its
throat
cut
all
dead
and
stiff
ulenspiegel
thoughts
ran
at
once
to
the
treasure
he
hastened
to
the
hole
by
the
well
and
found
as
he
had
feared
that
it
was
empty
and
all
around
the
earth
scattered
about
far
and
wide
he
ran
back
to
katheline
and
struck
her
with
his
hand
where
are
the
caroluses
he
cried
yes
yes
strange
things
have
been
happening
she
answered
at
this
nele
tried
to
protect
her
mother
from
the
wrath
of
ulenspiegel
have
mercy
have
pity
she
cried
o
ulenspiegel
then
he
stopped
beating
the
wretched
woman
and
at
the
same
moment
soetkin
appeared
on
the
scene
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
matter
ulenspiegel
showed
her
the
dog
with
its
throat
cut
and
the
empty
hole
soetkin
turned
pale
and
cried
out
most
sorrowfully
o
god
thou
hast
brought
me
low
indeed
and
nele
seeing
how
gentle
soetkin
was
wept
also
and
was
very
sorrowful
but
katheline
flourishing
a
piece
of
parchment
that
she
held
in
her
hand
began
to
speak
in
this
wise
yes
yes
strange
things
and
wonderful
have
come
to
pass
this
night
for
he
came
to
me
my
good
one
my
beautiful
and
no
longer
did
his
face
display
that
ghastly
glitter
which
makes
me
so
afraid
and
it
was
with
a
great
tenderness
in
his
voice
that
he
addressed
me
yes
i
was
overcome
with
love
for
him
and
my
heart
was
melted
within
me
am
a
rich
man
he
told
me
soon
i
will
bring
thee
a
thousand
florins
in
gold
be
it
i
answered
him
rejoice
for
your
sake
rather
than
for
mine
hanske
my
pet
is
there
no
one
else
in
your
cottage
he
asked
you
love
perhaps
and
would
rejoice
to
see
enriched
by
me
also
i
replied
that
live
here
have
no
need
of
any
help
of
thine
are
proud
it
seems
he
answered
and
ulenspiegel
are
they
then
so
rich
as
to
need
nothing
live
without
the
help
of
any
i
told
him
spite
of
the
confiscations
he
asked
but
then
i
laughed
aloud
and
said
that
he
knew
that
they
would
not
be
such
simpletons
as
to
hide
their
treasure
in
the
house
where
it
could
be
easily
found
yet
in
the
cellar
he
persisted
course
not
i
told
him
yet
in
the
yard
to
that
i
answered
not
a
word
he
said
would
indeed
be
a
piece
of
imprudence
so
imprudent
as
all
that
i
answered
neither
walls
nor
water
have
tongues
and
at
that
he
began
laughing
to
himself
presently
he
went
away
earlier
it
was
than
usual
but
first
he
gave
me
a
powder
telling
me
that
if
i
took
it
i
should
be
spirited
away
to
the
finest
of
all
the
sabbaths
i
accompanied
him
a
little
way
just
as
i
was
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
yard
and
i
seemed
half
asleep
and
soon
i
found
myself
even
as
he
had
told
me
at
the
witches
sabbath
and
i
did
not
return
from
thence
until
the
morning
then
it
was
that
i
found
myself
here
as
you
see
me
and
discovered
the
dog
with
his
throat
cut
and
the
empty
hole
and
this
is
a
heavy
blow
to
me
to
me
that
loved
him
so
tenderly
and
had
given
to
him
my
very
soul
but
whatsoever
i
have
shall
be
yours
and
i
will
labour
with
my
hands
and
my
feet
to
keep
you
alive
never
fear
but
soetkin
said
i
am
become
even
as
the
corn
beneath
the
grindstone
god
and
this
devil
robber
are
heavy
upon
me
both
at
once
robber
do
you
call
him
cried
katheline
speak
not
so
he
is
a
devil
a
devil
i
say
and
for
proof
i
will
show
to
you
this
parchment
which
he
left
behind
him
in
the
yard
and
on
it
is
written
not
to
serve
me
and
behold
in
three
times
two
weeks
and
five
days
i
will
render
thee
back
again
twice
as
much
again
as
the
treasure
i
have
now
taken
from
thee
doubt
not
or
else
thou
wilt
surely
die
and
oh
cried
katheline
of
a
surety
he
will
keep
his
word
poor
mad
thing
said
soetkin
and
this
was
the
only
word
of
reproach
that
she
uttered
xlviii
six
months
passed
and
the
devil
lover
came
no
more
nevertheless
katheline
did
not
live
without
hope
of
seeing
her
hanske
again
soetkin
meanwhile
had
given
up
her
work
altogether
and
was
always
to
be
found
sitting
huddled
up
in
front
of
the
fire
and
her
cough
never
left
her
nele
provided
the
choicest
and
most
sweetly
smelling
herbs
but
no
remedy
had
any
power
over
her
as
for
ulenspiegel
he
never
left
the
cottage
for
fear
that
his
mother
might
die
while
he
was
out
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
the
widow
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
without
being
sick
the
surgeon
who
also
carried
on
the
trade
of
a
barber
came
to
bleed
her
and
when
the
blood
had
been
taken
away
she
was
so
enfeebled
that
she
could
not
leave
her
chair
and
at
last
the
evening
came
when
she
cried
out
all
wasted
with
pain
claes
husband
and
tyl
my
son
thanks
be
to
god
for
he
taketh
me
and
with
a
sigh
she
died
katheline
did
not
dare
to
watch
by
that
bed
of
death
so
nele
and
ulenspiegel
kept
watch
together
and
all
night
long
they
prayed
for
her
that
was
gone
as
the
dawn
broke
a
swallow
came
flying
in
by
the
open
window
nele
said
the
bird
of
souls
it
is
a
good
omen
soetkin
is
in
heaven
the
swallow
flew
three
times
round
the
room
and
departed
with
a
cry
then
there
came
a
second
swallow
larger
it
was
and
darker
than
the
first
it
fluttered
around
ulenspiegel
and
he
said
father
and
mother
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
breast
whatsoever
you
command
me
that
will
i
do
and
the
second
swallow
went
off
with
a
cry
just
as
the
first
had
done
and
ulenspiegel
saw
thousands
of
swallows
skimming
over
the
fields
and
the
sun
rose
and
soetkin
was
buried
in
the
cemetery
of
the
poor
xlix
after
the
death
of
soetkin
ulenspiegel
grew
dreamy
sorrowful
and
angry
and
he
would
wander
about
the
fields
hearing
nothing
taking
what
food
or
drink
was
put
before
him
and
never
choosing
for
himself
and
oftentimes
he
rose
from
his
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
went
out
into
the
country
alone
in
vain
did
the
gentle
voice
of
nele
urge
him
not
to
despair
in
vain
did
katheline
assure
him
that
soetkin
was
now
in
paradise
with
claes
to
both
alike
tyl
answered
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
breast
and
he
was
as
one
mad
and
nele
was
sorrowful
because
of
him
meanwhile
grypstuiver
the
fishmonger
dwelt
alone
in
his
house
like
a
parricide
daring
only
to
come
out
in
the
evening
for
if
any
man
or
woman
passed
him
on
the
road
they
would
shout
after
him
and
call
him
murderer
and
the
little
children
ran
away
when
they
saw
him
for
they
had
been
told
that
he
was
a
hangman
so
he
wandered
about
by
himself
not
venturing
to
enter
any
of
the
taverns
that
are
in
damme
for
the
finger
of
scorn
was
pointed
at
him
and
if
ever
he
stood
in
the
bar
for
a
minute
they
that
were
drinking
there
left
the
tavern
the
result
was
that
no
innkeeper
desired
him
as
a
customer
any
more
and
whenever
he
presented
himself
at
their
houses
they
would
shut
the
door
on
him
the
fishmonger
would
make
a
humble
remonstrance
but
they
answered
that
they
had
a
licence
to
sell
wine
certainly
but
that
they
were
not
obliged
to
sell
it
against
their
will
the
fishmonger
grew
impatient
at
this
and
in
future
when
he
wanted
a
drink
he
would
go
to
the
in
roode
valck
at
the
sign
of
the
red
falcon
a
little
cabaret
outside
the
town
on
the
banks
of
the
sluys
canal
there
they
served
him
for
they
were
hard
up
at
that
inn
and
glad
to
get
anything
from
any
one
but
even
so
the
innkeeper
never
entered
into
conversation
with
him
nor
did
his
wife
either
now
in
that
house
there
were
also
two
children
and
a
dog
but
when
the
fishmonger
made
as
though
he
would
kiss
the
children
they
ran
away
and
the
dog
when
he
called
him
tried
to
bite
him
one
evening
ulenspiegel
was
standing
on
his
doorstep
in
a
dream
and
mathyssen
the
cooper
happening
to
pass
by
saw
him
standing
there
and
said
to
him
if
you
worked
with
your
hands
belike
you
would
forget
this
grievous
blow
but
ulenspiegel
answered
the
ashes
of
claes
beat
upon
my
breast
ah
said
mathyssen
there
lives
a
man
who
is
sadder
even
than
you
are
grypstuiver
the
fishmonger
none
speaks
to
him
and
all
avoid
him
so
much
so
that
when
he
wants
his
pint
of
bruinbier
he
is
forced
to
go
out
all
alone
to
the
poor
folk
of
the
roode
valck
verily
he
is
well
punished
the
ashes
beat
ulenspiegel
answered
him
again
and
the
same
evening
when
the
bells
of
notre
dame
were
sounding
the
ninth
hour
ulenspiegel
sallied
forth
towards
the
roode
valck
but
failing
to
find
the
fishmonger
there
as
he
had
expected
he
went
wandering
along
under
the
trees
that
grow
by
the
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
presently
he
saw
the
figure
of
the
murderer
coming
towards
him
he
passed
close
in
front
of
ulenspiegel
who
could
hear
what
he
was
saying
for
the
fishmonger
was
talking
to
himself
as
is
the
custom
of
they
who
live
much
alone
where
have
they
hidden
it
he
muttered
where
have
they
hidden
the
money
but
ulenspiegel
answered
the
question
for
him
by
giving
him
a
great
blow
in
the
face
alas
cried
the
fishmonger
as
he
felt
the
hand
of
ulenspiegel
upon
him
alas
i
know
you
you
are
his
son
but
have
pity
on
me
have
pity
for
i
am
weak
and
aged
and
what
i
did
to
your
father
was
not
done
out
of
malice
but
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
only
deign
to
forgive
me
and
i
will
give
you
back
again
all
the
goods
that
i
have
bought
and
you
shall
not
pay
me
a
penny
you
shall
have
everything
and
half
a
florin
over
and
above
for
i
am
not
a
rich
man
no
you
must
not
think
that
i
am
rich
and
he
was
about
to
kneel
down
in
front
of
ulenspiegel
but
seeing
him
so
ugly
so
craven
and
so
base
ulenspiegel
took
hold
of
him
and
threw
him
into
the
canal
and
he
went
away
l
and
from
many
a
funeral
pyre
there
ascended
to
heaven
the
smoke
from
the
flesh
of
the
victims
and
ulenspiegel
thinking
ever
upon
claes
and
soetkin
wept
in
his
loneliness
at
last
one
evening
he
went
to
find
katheline
thinking
to
inquire
of
her
some
way
of
remedy
or
revenge
she
was
alone
with
nele
sewing
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
at
the
sound
which
ulenspiegel
made
as
he
came
in
katheline
raised
her
head
slowly
like
one
that
is
awakened
from
a
heavy
sleep
he
said
the
ashes
of
claes
beat
upon
my
breast
and
i
am
fain
to
do
somewhat
to
save
this
land
of
flanders
but
what
can
i
do
i
have
entreated
the
great
god
of
earth
and
heaven
but
he
has
answered
me
nothing
katheline
said
the
great
god
can
not
hear
you
first
of
all
you
should
have
recourse
to
the
spirits
of
the
elemental
world
for
they
uniting
in
themselves
two
natures
both
celestial
and
terrestrial
are
enabled
to
receive
the
plaints
of
men
and
hand
them
on
unto
the
angels
who
themselves
in
their
turn
carry
them
up
thereafter
to
the
throne
help
me
he
said
only
help
me
now
and
i
will
repay
you
with
my
blood
if
need
be
i
can
help
you
said
katheline
on
one
condition
only
that
a
girl
who
loves
you
is
willing
to
take
you
with
her
to
the
sabbath
of
the
spirits
of
spring
which
is
the
easter
of
fruitfulness
i
will
take
him
said
nele
whereupon
katheline
took
a
crystal
goblet
and
poured
into
it
a
certain
mixture
of
a
greyish
colour
and
she
gave
it
to
them
both
to
drink
and
rubbed
their
temples
with
this
mixture
and
their
nostrils
likewise
and
the
palms
of
their
hands
and
their
wrists
and
she
also
caused
them
to
eat
a
pinch
of
white
powder
and
then
she
told
them
to
gaze
the
one
at
the
other
in
such
manner
that
their
two
souls
might
become
one
ulenspiegel
looked
at
nele
and
straightway
the
sweet
eyes
of
the
girl
illumined
in
him
a
mighty
flame
and
because
of
the
mixture
he
had
taken
he
felt
as
it
were
a
thousand
crabs
nipping
his
skin
all
over
him
after
that
nele
and
ulenspiegel
undressed
and
very
beautiful
they
looked
in
the
lamplight
he
in
the
pride
of
his
manly
strength
and
she
in
all
her
youthful
grace
and
sweetness
but
they
were
not
able
to
see
one
another
for
already
it
was
as
though
they
were
asleep
then
katheline
rested
the
neck
of
nele
upon
the
arm
of
ulenspiegel
and
taking
his
hand
she
placed
it
upon
the
young
girl
heart
and
there
they
stayed
all
naked
lying
side
by
side
and
to
both
of
them
it
seemed
that
their
bodies
where
they
touched
were
made
of
tender
fire
like
the
sun
itself
in
the
month
of
roses
then
as
they
afterwards
related
they
climbed
together
on
to
the
whence
they
threw
themselves
out
into
space
and
felt
the
air
all
round
them
buoying
them
up
as
the
waters
buoy
up
the
ships
at
sea
thereafter
they
lost
all
consciousness
seeing
naught
of
earth
where
slept
poor
mortals
nor
yet
of
heaven
whose
clouds
were
rolling
now
beneath
their
feet
for
now
they
had
set
their
feet
upon
sirius
the
frozen
star
and
from
thence
again
they
were
flung
upon
the
pole
there
it
was
that
a
fearful
sight
awaited
them
a
giant
all
naked
the
giant
winter
his
hair
was
wild
and
tawny
and
he
was
seated
on
an
with
his
back
resting
against
a
wall
of
ice
near
by
in
the
pools
of
water
there
disported
a
host
of
bears
and
seals
bellowing
all
round
him
in
a
hoarse
voice
the
giant
summoned
to
his
presence
the
and
the
and
the
icy
showers
also
there
came
at
his
behest
the
grey
clouds
and
brown
odorous
mists
and
the
winds
among
whom
is
the
sharp
north
wind
he
that
blows
the
strongest
of
all
such
were
the
terrors
that
raged
together
in
that
place
of
bane
but
smiling
in
the
midst
the
giant
reclined
on
a
bed
of
flowers
that
had
been
withered
by
his
own
hand
and
of
leaves
dried
by
his
very
breath
then
leaning
down
and
scratching
the
ground
with
his
and
biting
it
with
his
teeth
the
giant
began
to
burrow
a
great
pit
for
he
wanted
to
discover
the
heart
of
the
earth
to
devour
it
and
to
put
the
blackened
coal
where
once
there
had
been
shady
forests
and
chaff
where
once
had
been
corn
and
barren
sand
in
place
of
fruitful
soil
but
old
earth
heart
was
made
of
fire
so
that
he
dared
not
touch
it
but
recoiled
therefrom
in
dread
there
he
sat
like
a
king
upon
his
throne
draining
his
horn
of
oil
all
round
him
were
his
bears
and
seals
and
the
skeletons
of
those
whom
he
had
killed
on
the
high
seas
or
on
the
dry
land
or
in
the
cottages
of
the
poor
he
listened
joyfully
to
the
roaring
of
the
bears
to
the
braying
of
the
seals
and
to
the
sound
made
by
the
skeletons
of
men
and
animals
as
the
bones
clicked
together
beneath
the
claws
of
the
crows
and
vultures
that
came
for
the
last
remaining
piece
of
flesh
that
might
still
adhere
to
them
and
sweet
also
to
his
ears
was
the
noise
the
made
as
they
were
driven
one
against
another
by
the
waves
of
that
dreary
sea
and
when
he
spoke
the
voice
of
the
giant
was
even
as
the
roaring
of
a
hurricane
or
as
the
noise
of
winter
storms
or
as
the
wind
howling
in
the
chimneys
i
am
cold
and
afraid
said
ulenspiegel
he
is
powerless
against
immortal
souls
said
nele
even
as
she
spoke
a
great
commotion
arose
among
the
seals
who
began
to
rush
back
into
the
sea
with
all
haste
and
it
was
apparent
that
the
bears
also
were
afraid
for
they
lay
back
their
ears
and
began
to
bellow
most
piteously
as
for
the
crows
and
ravens
they
cawed
as
though
they
were
in
terror
of
their
lives
and
started
off
to
hide
themselves
among
the
clouds
and
now
it
was
that
nele
and
ulenspiegel
first
began
to
hear
a
sound
as
of
a
mighty
beating
upon
the
farther
side
of
that
glassy
wall
against
which
giant
winter
had
been
reclining
and
the
wall
cracked
visibly
and
shook
to
its
foundations
but
of
all
this
giant
winter
heard
nothing
at
all
for
he
went
on
baying
and
bellowing
most
joyfully
filling
and
emptying
again
and
again
his
bowl
of
oil
and
continuing
his
search
for
the
heart
of
the
earth
that
he
might
freeze
it
to
nothing
although
forsooth
whenever
he
found
that
fiery
centre
he
always
lacked
the
courage
so
much
as
to
take
it
in
his
hand
meanwhile
the
blows
of
the
resounded
heavier
and
louder
and
the
crack
in
the
wall
of
ice
grew
broader
every
second
and
all
around
the
giant
the
rain
of
icicles
ceased
not
to
fall
in
myriad
fragments
and
the
bears
roared
ceaselessly
and
piteously
and
the
seals
sent
up
their
plaintive
cries
from
the
dreary
waste
of
water
suddenly
the
wall
gave
way
and
from
the
bright
sky
beyond
it
a
man
descended
naked
he
was
most
beautiful
of
aspect
holding
in
one
of
his
hands
a
hatchet
of
pure
gold
this
was
lucifer
the
lord
of
the
spring
when
giant
winter
saw
him
he
immediately
cast
away
his
bowl
of
oil
and
entreated
the
to
spare
at
least
his
life
but
at
the
first
warm
breath
of
spring
giant
winter
lost
all
his
strength
and
lucifer
was
able
to
bind
him
with
a
chain
of
diamonds
and
tie
him
securely
to
the
pole
then
standing
still
the
lord
of
the
spring
most
tenderly
and
amorously
cried
aloud
and
from
the
heavens
there
descended
a
woman
naked
also
and
most
fair
most
beautiful
she
stood
beside
her
lord
and
spake
to
him
you
are
my
conqueror
strong
man
and
thus
he
answered
her
if
you
are
hungry
eat
if
you
are
thirsty
drink
if
you
are
afraid
come
near
to
me
i
am
your
mate
i
have
no
hunger
no
thirst
but
for
thee
alone
she
said
then
the
lord
of
the
spring
called
out
yet
seven
times
and
again
most
tremendous
was
his
voice
and
there
was
a
mighty
din
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
behind
him
there
came
into
being
a
kind
of
dais
all
made
of
suns
and
stars
and
the
lord
and
his
lady
sat
them
down
on
two
thrones
then
these
twain
their
countenances
remaining
still
and
motionless
and
without
the
least
tremor
to
spoil
the
calmness
of
their
majesty
and
their
power
both
together
cried
aloud
and
at
that
sound
there
was
a
movement
in
the
earth
like
that
of
a
countless
multitude
of
worms
and
not
in
the
earth
only
but
in
the
hard
stone
and
in
the
also
and
nele
and
ulenspiegel
heard
a
sound
like
that
which
might
be
made
by
gigantic
birds
trying
to
crack
with
their
beaks
the
great
imprisoning
wherein
they
were
concealed
and
amid
this
great
commotion
of
the
earth
heaving
and
subsiding
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
there
appeared
forms
like
those
of
eggs
and
suddenly
on
all
sides
trees
emerged
their
bare
branches
all
entangled
together
and
their
stems
shaking
and
tottering
together
like
drunken
men
which
began
to
separate
themselves
the
one
from
the
other
leaving
empty
spaces
of
earth
between
and
now
from
the
ever
restless
soil
there
emerged
the
spirits
of
earth
and
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
spirits
of
the
woods
and
from
the
neighbouring
sea
now
cleared
of
ice
the
spirits
of
the
water
and
nele
and
ulenspiegel
could
discern
the
guardian
spirits
of
all
these
wonders
dwarfs
there
were
men
of
the
woods
that
lived
like
trees
and
carried
instead
of
mouths
and
stomachs
little
clusters
of
roots
sprouting
from
below
the
face
to
the
end
that
they
might
suck
their
nourishment
from
the
bosom
of
mother
earth
lords
of
the
mines
there
were
as
well
they
that
know
no
speech
and
are
destitute
of
heart
or
entrails
and
move
about
like
glittering
automatons
there
came
also
the
dwarfs
of
flesh
and
bone
little
fellows
with
tails
and
the
heads
of
toads
and
a
lantern
on
their
head
for
these
are
they
that
leap
by
night
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
drunken
wayfarer
or
the
tired
traveller
and
then
jump
down
again
waving
their
lanterns
the
while
so
as
to
lead
into
marsh
or
ditch
that
hapless
wight
who
thinks
the
light
he
sees
is
a
candle
set
to
beacon
his
way
home
there
came
too
the
spirits
blossoms
they
of
womanly
health
and
strength
naked
they
were
and
unashamed
glorying
in
their
beauty
and
having
nothing
to
cover
them
but
their
hair
the
eyes
of
these
maids
shone
liquid
like
seen
through
water
the
flesh
of
their
bodies
was
firm
white
and
glittering
in
the
sunshine
and
from
ruby
lips
their
breath
wafted
down
more
balmy
than
jasmine
these
are
the
maids
that
wander
at
eventide
in
the
parks
or
gardens
of
the
world
or
belike
in
the
shady
paths
of
some
woodland
glade
amorous
they
are
searching
ever
for
some
soul
of
man
to
possess
it
for
themselves
and
whenever
some
mortal
lad
and
lass
come
walking
their
way
they
try
to
kill
the
girl
but
failing
in
this
they
breathe
a
breath
of
love
upon
the
doubting
damsel
so
that
she
fears
no
longer
to
abandon
herself
to
the
delights
of
love
but
gives
herself
to
her
lover
for
then
the
is
permitted
to
take
her
share
of
the
kisses
besides
all
this
nele
and
ulenspiegel
could
see
descending
now
far
from
heaven
the
guardian
spirits
of
the
stars
the
spirits
of
the
winds
of
the
breezes
and
of
the
rain
young
winged
men
that
fertilize
the
earth
and
there
appeared
from
every
point
in
the
heavens
the
the
dear
swallows
at
their
coming
the
light
itself
seemed
to
grow
brighter
and
the
the
lords
of
the
rocks
the
princes
of
the
mines
the
men
of
the
woods
the
spirits
of
water
fire
and
earth
all
cried
out
with
one
voice
o
light
o
sap
of
spring
glory
to
the
spirit
of
spring
and
though
the
sound
of
all
this
shouting
was
more
powerful
than
the
noise
of
a
raging
sea
or
of
a
or
of
a
hurricane
let
loose
yet
it
seemed
most
solemn
music
to
the
ears
of
nele
and
ulenspiegel
who
stood
motionless
and
dumb
curled
up
behind
the
gnarled
and
wrinkled
stem
of
a
mighty
oak
but
sights
more
terrible
yet
awaited
them
for
now
the
spirits
took
their
places
by
thousands
upon
the
backs
of
gigantic
spiders
and
toads
with
trunks
like
those
of
elephants
and
serpents
all
intertwined
and
crocodiles
that
stood
upright
on
their
tails
and
held
a
whole
bevy
of
spirits
in
their
mouths
snakes
too
there
were
that
carried
more
than
thirty
dwarfs
at
a
time
both
male
and
female
sitting
astride
on
their
writhing
bodies
and
thousands
upon
thousands
of
insects
more
huge
than
goliath
himself
armed
with
swords
lances
jagged
scythes
forks
and
every
other
kind
of
murderous
and
horrifying
implement
great
was
the
uproar
and
stern
the
battle
which
they
fought
amongst
themselves
the
strong
eating
up
the
weak
and
getting
fat
thereon
thus
demonstrating
how
death
is
ever
born
from
life
and
life
from
death
and
out
of
all
this
throng
of
spirits
confused
and
serried
there
came
a
sound
as
of
a
deep
rumbling
of
thunder
or
of
a
hundred
looms
of
weavers
fullers
and
locksmiths
all
working
together
in
full
swing
and
suddenly
the
spirits
of
the
sap
made
their
appearance
on
the
scene
short
they
were
and
squat
and
their
loins
were
as
large
as
the
great
barrel
of
heidelberg
itself
and
their
thighs
were
fat
like
hogsheads
of
wine
and
their
muscles
so
strangely
strong
and
powerful
that
one
would
have
said
that
their
bodies
were
made
of
naught
but
eggs
eggs
big
and
little
joined
up
to
one
another
and
covered
over
with
a
kind
of
ruddy
skin
strong
and
glistening
like
their
scanty
beards
and
tawny
hair
and
they
carried
great
tankards
or
goblets
that
were
filled
with
a
strange
liquor
when
the
other
spirits
saw
them
coming
there
at
once
arose
among
them
a
great
flutter
of
joy
the
trees
and
the
plants
became
the
victims
of
a
strange
restlessness
and
the
thirsty
earth
opened
in
a
thousand
fissures
that
it
might
drink
of
the
liquor
and
the
spirits
of
the
sap
poured
out
their
wine
and
at
the
same
moment
everything
began
to
bud
and
to
grow
green
and
to
come
into
flower
and
the
sward
was
alive
with
buzzing
insects
and
the
sky
was
filled
with
birds
and
butterflies
the
spirits
meanwhile
continued
pouring
out
their
sap
and
those
below
them
received
the
wine
as
they
best
were
able
the
opening
their
mouths
and
leaping
upon
the
tawny
and
kissing
them
for
more
others
clasping
their
hands
in
prayer
yet
others
in
their
delight
allowing
the
precious
liquid
to
rain
upon
them
as
it
would
but
all
alike
hungry
and
thirsty
flying
standing
still
running
or
motionless
all
greedy
for
the
wine
and
more
alive
for
every
drop
they
were
able
to
get
and
none
was
there
so
old
whether
he
were
plain
or
handsome
but
he
was
filled
with
fresh
force
and
with
new
and
lusty
youth
and
with
great
shouting
and
laughing
they
pursued
each
other
among
the
trees
like
squirrels
or
in
the
air
like
birds
each
male
seeking
his
female
and
acting
out
beneath
god
open
sky
the
sacred
task
of
nature
and
the
spirits
of
the
sap
brought
to
the
king
and
queen
a
mighty
bowl
brimming
with
their
wine
and
the
king
and
the
queen
drank
thereof
and
embraced
one
another
and
the
king
holding
the
queen
fast
in
his
arms
threw
the
dregs
of
that
bowl
far
away
upon
the
trees
and
flowers
and
all
the
other
spirits
that
were
there
and
loud
did
he
raise
his
voice
crying
glory
to
life
glory
to
the
free
air
glory
to
force
and
all
with
one
voice
cried
aloud
glory
to
nature
glory
to
life
and
ulenspiegel
took
nele
in
his
arms
and
thus
entwined
a
dance
began
an
eddying
dance
like
that
of
leaves
in
a
whirlwind
and
in
that
vortex
everything
was
swinging
together
both
trees
and
plants
and
insects
the
butterflies
heaven
and
earth
itself
the
king
and
his
queen
the
and
the
lords
of
the
mines
spirits
of
the
water
hunchbacked
dwarfs
lords
of
the
rocks
men
of
the
woods
guardian
spirits
of
the
stars
and
the
thousand
thousand
terrible
insects
all
commingled
with
their
lances
their
jagged
swords
their
forks
a
giddy
dance
it
was
rolling
in
the
space
which
it
filled
a
dance
wherein
the
very
sun
and
moon
took
part
and
the
stars
and
planets
the
clouds
and
the
winds
and
in
that
whirlwind
the
oak
to
which
nele
and
ulenspiegel
were
clinging
rolled
over
on
its
side
and
ulenspiegel
said
to
nele
we
are
going
to
die
little
one
these
words
of
ulenspiegel
one
of
the
spirits
overheard
and
seeing
that
they
were
mortals
men
he
cried
men
here
and
he
dragged
them
from
the
tree
to
which
they
clung
and
cast
them
into
the
very
midst
of
the
crowd
but
they
fell
softly
on
the
backs
of
the
spirits
who
passed
them
on
one
to
another
bidding
them
welcome
in
such
terms
as
these
all
hail
to
man
all
hail
worms
of
the
earth
who
is
there
now
would
like
to
see
a
young
mortal
a
boy
or
a
little
girl
poor
wights
that
are
come
to
pay
us
a
visit
nele
and
ulenspiegel
flew
from
one
to
the
other
crying
mercy
but
the
spirits
payed
no
attention
to
them
and
they
were
suffered
to
go
on
flying
about
legs
in
air
heads
downwards
whirling
about
like
feathers
in
a
winter
wind
and
all
the
time
the
spirits
were
saying
hail
to
the
little
men
and
little
women
come
dance
like
us
now
the
desired
to
separate
nele
from
ulenspiegel
and
they
would
have
beaten
her
to
death
had
not
the
king
of
the
spring
stopped
the
dance
suddenly
with
a
single
gesture
bring
them
to
me
he
cried
bring
before
me
these
two
lice
so
they
were
separated
the
one
from
the
other
each
doing
all
she
could
to
tear
ulenspiegel
from
her
rival
saying
tyl
tyl
wouldst
not
die
to
have
me
i
shall
die
soon
enough
answered
ulenspiegel
and
the
dwarfish
spirits
of
the
woods
that
carried
nele
said
to
her
also
why
are
you
not
a
spirit
like
us
that
we
might
take
you
and
nele
answered
only
have
patience
so
they
came
at
length
before
the
throne
of
the
king
and
when
they
saw
his
golden
axe
and
his
crown
of
iron
they
began
to
tremble
with
fear
and
he
asked
them
wherefore
have
you
come
to
see
me
poor
little
things
but
they
answered
him
not
at
all
i
know
you
added
the
king
you
bud
of
a
witch
and
you
also
shoot
of
a
by
power
of
sorcery
have
you
penetrated
into
this
laboratory
of
nature
yet
now
your
lips
are
closed
like
capon
stuffed
with
nele
trembled
as
she
gazed
upon
the
awful
aspect
of
that
spirit
but
the
manly
courage
of
ulenspiegel
revived
and
he
made
answer
bravely
the
ashes
of
claes
beat
upon
my
breast
for
most
divine
highness
death
now
goes
gathering
his
harvest
through
all
the
land
of
flanders
mowing
down
the
bravest
of
her
men
and
the
sweetest
of
her
women
in
the
name
of
his
holiness
the
pope
and
the
privileges
of
my
country
are
broken
her
charters
annulled
she
is
wasted
by
famine
her
weavers
and
abandon
her
to
look
for
work
in
other
lands
and
soon
must
she
die
if
none
comes
to
her
aid
your
highness
i
am
naught
indeed
but
a
poor
little
chit
of
a
man
that
has
come
into
the
world
like
any
other
and
i
have
lived
as
i
was
able
imperfect
limited
on
every
side
ignorant
neither
virtuous
nor
chaste
and
most
unworthy
of
any
grace
human
or
divine
yet
my
mother
soetkin
died
as
the
result
of
torture
and
grief
and
claes
was
burned
in
a
terrible
fire
and
i
have
sworn
to
avenge
them
once
i
have
been
able
to
do
this
but
now
i
long
to
see
the
miserable
soil
of
my
native
land
made
happy
the
soil
where
the
bones
of
my
parents
lie
scattered
and
i
have
asked
of
god
the
death
of
our
persecutors
but
not
yet
has
he
heard
my
prayer
this
is
why
all
weary
of
my
complaining
i
have
evoked
your
presence
by
the
power
of
katheline
charm
and
this
is
why
we
are
come
to
you
i
and
my
trembling
comrade
here
to
fall
at
your
feet
and
to
beg
you
most
divine
highness
to
save
our
poor
land
to
this
the
king
and
his
illustrious
companion
as
with
one
voice
made
answer
by
battle
and
fire
by
death
and
sword
seek
the
seven
in
death
and
blood
ruin
and
tears
find
the
seven
ugly
cruel
wicked
deformed
very
scourge
of
the
whole
earth
burn
the
seven
listen
now
attend
and
see
tell
us
poor
thing
are
you
not
glad
find
the
seven
and
all
the
spirits
sang
now
together
in
death
and
blood
in
ruin
and
tears
find
the
seven
listen
now
attend
and
see
tell
us
poor
thing
are
you
not
glad
find
the
seven
but
ulenspiegel
only
said
your
highness
and
you
my
lords
spirits
i
understand
nothing
of
your
language
you
are
mocking
me
without
a
doubt
but
the
spirits
without
listening
to
him
at
all
went
on
with
their
singing
when
the
north
shall
kiss
the
west
then
shall
be
the
end
of
ruin
find
the
seven
and
the
cincture
and
they
sang
with
such
an
effect
of
unanimity
and
such
a
terrifying
force
of
sound
that
the
very
earth
trembled
and
the
heavens
shuddered
and
the
birds
twittered
the
owls
hooted
the
sparrows
chirruped
with
fear
the
wailed
aloud
flying
hither
and
thither
in
their
dismay
and
all
the
animals
of
the
earth
lions
snakes
bears
stags
wolves
dogs
and
cats
roared
hissed
belled
howled
barked
and
miawed
most
terribly
and
the
spirits
kept
on
singing
listen
now
attend
and
see
love
the
seven
and
the
cincture
and
the
cocks
crowed
and
all
the
spirits
vanished
away
excepting
only
one
wicked
lord
of
the
mines
who
took
nele
and
ulenspiegel
each
in
one
of
his
arms
and
cast
them
most
roughly
into
the
void
then
they
awoke
and
found
themselves
lying
by
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
asleep
and
they
shivered
in
the
chill
morning
air
and
ulenspiegel
beheld
the
sweet
body
of
nele
all
golden
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
here
begins
the
second
book
of
the
legend
of
the
glorious
joyous
and
heroic
adventures
of
tyl
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
goedzak
in
the
land
of
flanders
and
elsewhere
i
one
morning
in
september
ulenspiegel
took
his
staff
three
florins
that
had
been
given
him
by
katheline
a
piece
of
pig
liver
and
a
slice
of
bread
and
set
out
to
go
from
damme
to
antwerp
seeking
the
seven
nele
he
left
asleep
on
the
way
he
met
a
dog
who
followed
after
him
smelling
around
because
of
the
liver
and
jumping
up
at
his
legs
ulenspiegel
would
have
driven
off
the
dog
but
seeing
the
persistence
of
the
animal
he
thus
addressed
him
my
dear
dog
you
are
certainly
to
leave
your
home
where
you
would
find
awaiting
you
an
excellent
meal
of
patties
and
other
fine
remains
to
say
nothing
of
the
to
follow
as
you
are
now
doing
a
mere
adventurer
of
the
road
a
vagabond
that
is
like
to
lack
so
much
as
a
root
to
give
you
for
nourishment
follow
my
advice
most
imprudent
little
dog
and
return
to
your
innkeeper
and
for
the
future
take
good
care
to
avoid
the
rain
and
snow
the
hail
the
drizzling
mists
the
glassy
frosts
and
other
such
wretched
fare
as
is
alone
reserved
for
the
back
of
the
poor
wanderer
keep
close
at
home
rather
in
a
corner
of
the
hearth
and
warm
yourself
curled
up
in
front
of
the
cheerful
fire
but
leave
to
me
the
long
wandering
in
mud
and
dust
in
cold
and
heat
to
be
roasted
frozen
plenished
on
friday
but
on
sunday
famished
for
want
of
food
for
trust
me
little
dog
the
wise
thing
is
to
return
at
once
like
a
sensible
and
experienced
little
dog
to
the
place
whence
you
came
but
it
would
seem
that
the
animal
did
not
hear
a
single
word
of
what
ulenspiegel
was
saying
for
he
continued
to
wag
his
tail
and
jump
his
highest
barking
all
the
while
in
his
desire
for
food
ulenspiegel
imagined
that
all
this
was
just
a
sign
of
friendliness
and
gave
no
thought
to
the
liver
which
he
carried
in
his
scrip
so
on
and
on
he
walked
with
the
dog
following
behind
and
when
they
had
gone
in
this
way
the
better
part
of
a
league
they
saw
a
cart
on
the
roadside
with
a
donkey
harnessed
thereto
holding
his
head
down
on
a
bank
at
the
side
of
the
road
between
two
clumps
of
thistles
reclined
a
man
he
was
very
fat
and
in
one
hand
he
held
the
of
a
leg
of
mutton
and
in
the
other
hand
a
bottle
he
gnawed
the
and
drank
from
the
bottle
but
when
he
was
doing
neither
of
these
things
he
would
fall
to
weeping
and
groaning
ulenspiegel
stopped
on
his
way
and
the
dog
stopped
too
but
quickly
jumped
up
on
to
the
bank
smelling
doubtless
a
good
odour
of
liver
and
mutton
there
he
sat
on
his
hind
legs
by
the
fat
man
side
and
began
to
paw
at
the
stranger
doublet
as
much
as
to
say
please
give
me
a
share
of
your
meal
but
the
man
elbowed
him
off
and
holding
up
the
in
the
air
began
to
moan
aloud
most
piteously
the
dog
did
likewise
in
the
eagerness
of
his
desire
while
the
donkey
who
was
weary
of
being
tied
to
the
cart
and
thus
prevented
from
getting
at
the
thistles
set
up
in
his
turn
a
most
piercing
bray
what
the
matter
now
jan
the
man
inquired
of
his
donkey
nothing
said
ulenspiegel
answering
for
him
except
that
he
would
fain
make
his
breakfast
off
those
thistles
that
grow
there
on
either
side
of
you
like
the
thistles
that
are
carved
on
the
at
tessenderloo
below
the
figure
of
our
lord
nor
would
this
dog
here
i
thinking
be
any
the
less
inclined
to
join
his
jaws
together
on
the
bone
you
have
got
there
but
in
the
meanwhile
i
will
give
him
a
piece
of
this
liver
of
mine
the
man
looked
up
at
ulenspiegel
who
straightway
recognized
him
as
none
other
than
his
friend
lamme
goedzak
of
damme
lamme
he
cried
you
here
and
what
are
you
doing
eating
and
drinking
and
moaning
has
some
soldier
or
other
been
so
impertinent
as
to
box
your
ears
or
what
the
matter
tell
me
alas
said
lamme
my
wife
and
he
would
have
emptied
his
bottle
of
wine
there
and
then
had
not
ulenspiegel
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
suggested
that
it
were
fairer
that
the
drink
should
be
given
to
him
that
had
none
besides
he
added
to
drink
thus
distractedly
profits
naught
but
one
kidneys
well
said
answered
lamme
handing
his
friend
the
bottle
but
will
you
drink
i
wonder
to
any
better
purpose
ulenspiegel
took
the
bottle
drank
his
fill
then
handed
it
back
again
call
me
a
spaniard
he
said
if
i
left
enough
to
make
a
minnow
drunk
lamme
inspected
the
bottle
then
without
ever
ceasing
to
groan
he
rummaged
in
his
wallet
and
produced
another
bottle
and
another
piece
of
sausage
which
he
cut
up
in
slices
and
began
to
munch
in
the
most
melancholy
fashion
do
you
never
stop
eating
lamme
asked
ulenspiegel
often
my
son
he
replied
but
now
i
am
eating
to
drive
away
sad
thoughts
where
are
you
wife
of
mine
and
as
he
spoke
lamme
wiped
away
a
tear
after
which
he
cut
himself
ten
slices
of
sausage
lamme
said
ulenspiegel
you
should
not
eat
so
quickly
taking
no
thought
at
all
for
the
poor
pilgrim
lamme
who
was
still
whimpering
gave
four
of
the
slices
to
ulenspiegel
who
ate
them
up
immediately
and
was
much
affected
by
their
good
flavour
but
lamme
said
eating
and
crying
all
at
the
same
time
o
wife
o
goodly
wife
of
mine
how
sweet
she
was
how
beautiful
she
was
light
as
a
butterfly
nimble
as
the
lightning
and
with
a
voice
like
a
skylark
for
all
that
she
was
overfond
of
fine
clothes
alas
but
how
well
she
looked
in
them
and
surely
the
flowers
also
are
they
not
fond
of
rich
apparel
oh
if
you
had
seen
her
my
son
her
little
hands
so
nimble
to
caress
such
hands
as
you
never
could
have
suffered
to
come
in
contact
with
saucepan
or
and
her
complexion
which
was
clear
as
the
day
would
surely
have
been
burnt
by
standing
over
the
kitchen
fire
and
what
eyes
she
had
only
to
look
at
them
was
to
be
melted
quite
with
tenderness
alas
i
have
lost
her
go
on
eating
tyl
it
is
good
ghent
sausage
but
why
has
she
left
you
asked
ulenspiegel
how
should
i
know
lamme
replied
alas
gone
for
ever
are
those
days
when
i
used
to
go
to
her
home
then
verily
she
would
fly
away
from
me
half
in
love
and
half
in
fear
and
her
arms
were
bare
as
like
as
not
beautiful
arms
they
were
so
round
and
white
but
if
she
saw
me
looking
at
them
she
would
cover
them
quickly
with
the
sleeve
of
her
gown
at
other
times
again
she
would
gladly
lend
herself
to
my
caresses
and
i
would
kiss
her
closed
eyes
and
that
lovely
neck
of
hers
so
large
and
firm
she
would
shiver
all
over
uttering
little
cries
of
love
and
then
leaning
her
head
backwards
she
would
give
me
a
playful
slap
upon
my
nose
thereafter
she
would
laugh
and
i
would
cry
aloud
and
we
would
wrestle
together
right
amorously
and
there
was
naught
betwixt
us
but
laughter
and
fun
but
there
there
is
any
wine
left
in
the
bottle
tyl
tyl
gave
him
what
remained
this
ham
does
great
good
to
my
stomach
he
said
to
mine
also
answered
lamme
but
i
shall
never
see
my
dear
one
again
she
has
fled
away
from
damme
what
say
you
will
you
come
with
me
in
my
cart
to
look
for
her
that
will
i
answered
ulenspiegel
so
they
got
up
into
the
and
the
donkey
set
up
a
most
melancholy
bray
to
celebrate
their
departure
as
for
the
dog
he
had
already
made
off
well
filled
without
a
word
to
any
one
ii
while
the
cart
went
lumbering
along
on
the
top
of
the
dike
with
the
pond
on
one
side
and
the
canal
on
the
other
ulenspiegel
sat
brooding
on
the
past
and
cherishing
in
his
bosom
the
ashes
of
claes
he
pondered
deeply
upon
that
vision
he
had
seen
and
asked
himself
if
indeed
it
were
true
or
false
and
if
those
spirits
of
nature
had
been
making
mock
of
him
or
if
perchance
they
had
been
revealing
to
him
under
a
figure
those
things
that
must
be
done
if
the
land
of
his
fathers
were
to
be
restored
in
vain
did
he
turn
the
matter
over
and
over
in
his
mind
for
he
could
not
discover
what
was
meant
by
those
words
the
seven
and
the
cincture
he
called
to
mind
the
late
emperor
charles
v
the
present
king
the
governess
of
the
netherlands
the
pope
of
rome
the
grand
inquisitor
and
last
of
all
the
general
of
the
jesuits
six
great
persecutors
of
his
country
whom
most
willingly
would
he
have
burned
alive
had
he
been
able
but
he
was
forced
to
conclude
that
none
of
these
was
the
personage
indicated
for
that
they
were
all
too
obviously
worthy
of
being
burnt
and
would
be
in
another
place
and
he
could
only
go
on
repeating
to
himself
those
words
of
the
lord
of
the
spring
when
the
north
shall
kiss
the
west
then
shall
be
the
end
of
ruin
love
the
seven
and
the
cincture
alas
he
cried
in
death
in
blood
in
tears
find
the
seven
burn
the
seven
love
the
seven
what
does
it
all
mean
my
poor
brain
reels
for
who
pray
would
ever
want
to
burn
that
which
he
loved
the
cart
by
this
time
had
progressed
a
good
way
along
the
road
when
all
at
once
a
sound
was
heard
of
some
one
stepping
along
the
sand
and
of
a
voice
singing
oh
have
ye
seen
him
ye
that
pass
the
lover
i
have
lost
alas
feckless
he
wandereth
knowing
no
tie
have
ye
seen
him
pass
by
as
tender
lamb
the
eagle
seizeth
so
on
my
poor
heart
he
feedeth
beardless
his
chin
though
to
manhood
nigh
have
ye
seen
him
pass
by
if
ye
find
him
ye
may
tell
weary
with
following
faints
his
nele
o
tyl
my
beloved
hear
me
i
cry
have
ye
seen
him
pass
by
languisheth
ever
the
faithful
dove
seeking
seeking
her
fickle
love
so
far
more
so
languish
i
have
ye
seen
him
pass
by
ulenspiegel
gave
lamme
a
blow
on
his
great
belly
and
told
him
to
hold
his
breath
that
said
lamme
is
a
very
difficult
thing
i
fear
for
a
man
of
my
corpulence
but
ulenspiegel
paying
no
further
attention
to
his
companion
hid
himself
behind
the
canvas
hood
of
the
cart
and
began
to
sing
in
the
voice
of
a
man
with
a
bad
cold
that
has
drunk
well
in
a
shaky
old
cart
with
age
all
green
your
feckless
sweetheart
i
have
seen
and
a
glutton
rides
with
him
like
pig
in
sty
i
have
seen
him
pass
by
tyl
said
lamme
you
have
a
wry
tongue
in
your
cheek
this
morning
but
tyl
put
his
head
out
of
a
hole
in
the
hood
nele
do
you
know
me
he
said
and
nele
for
it
was
none
other
than
she
herself
was
filled
with
fear
crying
and
laughing
all
at
the
same
time
and
her
cheeks
were
wet
as
she
answered
him
i
see
you
and
i
know
you
you
wretch
you
traitor
nele
said
ulenspiegel
if
you
want
to
give
me
a
beating
you
will
find
a
stick
in
the
cart
here
it
is
heavy
enough
in
all
conscience
and
knotted
so
that
it
will
leave
its
mark
right
enough
tyl
said
nele
are
you
seeking
the
seven
even
so
tyl
told
her
now
nele
carried
with
her
a
bag
or
satchel
that
was
so
full
it
seemed
likely
to
burst
this
satchel
she
offered
to
tyl
saying
i
thought
it
was
unwholesome
tyl
that
a
man
should
go
on
a
journey
without
a
good
fat
goose
and
a
ham
and
some
ghent
sausages
so
take
them
and
when
you
eat
of
them
think
of
me
while
ulenspiegel
stood
gazing
at
nele
quite
oblivious
of
the
satchel
which
she
was
holding
out
to
him
lamme
poked
out
his
head
from
another
hole
in
the
hood
and
began
to
address
the
girl
in
his
turn
o
girl
most
wise
he
said
o
girl
most
prudent
if
he
refuses
such
a
gift
it
must
be
from
pure
absence
of
mind
but
you
had
much
better
give
into
my
own
keeping
that
goose
of
yours
that
ham
and
those
fine
sausages
i
will
take
care
of
them
i
promise
you
and
who
asked
nele
of
her
lover
who
may
this
be
a
victim
of
the
married
state
tyl
told
her
that
is
wasting
away
with
sorrow
and
would
soon
in
fact
shrink
away
to
nothing
like
an
overbaked
apple
were
it
not
that
he
recuperated
his
strength
from
time
to
time
and
all
the
time
by
taking
nourishment
alas
my
son
sighed
lamme
what
you
say
is
only
too
true
now
it
was
very
hot
and
nele
had
covered
her
head
with
her
apron
because
of
the
sun
ulenspiegel
looked
upon
her
and
conceived
a
sudden
desire
to
be
alone
with
her
he
turned
to
lamme
and
pointed
to
a
woman
that
was
walking
some
way
off
in
a
field
do
you
see
that
woman
he
said
i
see
her
said
lamme
do
you
recognize
her
heavens
cried
lamme
can
it
be
my
wife
in
truth
she
is
dressed
like
no
common
country
wench
can
you
still
be
doubtful
you
old
mole
but
supposing
it
were
not
her
after
all
said
lamme
you
would
be
none
the
worse
off
ulenspiegel
told
him
for
over
there
to
the
left
towards
the
north
i
know
a
tavern
that
sells
most
excellent
bruinbier
we
will
join
you
there
and
here
meanwhile
is
some
salt
ham
that
will
provide
an
excellent
relish
to
your
thirst
so
lamme
got
down
from
the
cart
and
made
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
in
the
direction
of
the
woman
in
the
field
ulenspiegel
said
to
nele
why
will
you
not
come
near
me
then
he
helped
her
to
climb
up
beside
him
on
to
the
cart
and
made
her
sit
close
by
his
side
he
removed
her
apron
from
her
head
and
the
cloak
from
her
shoulders
and
then
when
he
had
kissed
her
a
hundred
times
at
least
he
asked
her
where
were
you
going
to
beloved
she
answered
him
nothing
but
seemed
carried
away
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
ulenspiegel
in
like
rapture
said
to
her
anyway
you
are
here
now
and
truly
the
wild
hedgerow
is
dun
beside
the
sweet
pink
colouring
of
your
skin
and
though
you
are
no
queen
behold
i
will
make
a
crown
of
kisses
all
for
you
o
sweet
arms
of
my
love
so
tender
so
rosy
and
made
for
nothing
but
to
hold
me
in
their
embrace
ah
little
girl
little
love
how
dare
i
touch
you
these
rough
hands
of
mine
will
they
not
tarnish
the
purity
of
your
white
shoulder
yea
verily
for
the
lightsome
butterfly
may
flit
to
rest
upon
the
crimson
carnation
but
i
clumsy
bumpkin
that
i
am
how
can
i
rest
myself
without
tarnishing
the
living
whiteness
that
is
you
god
is
in
heaven
the
king
is
on
his
throne
the
sun
rides
triumphing
in
the
sky
but
am
i
a
god
or
a
king
or
the
sun
himself
that
i
may
come
so
close
to
you
o

my
love
your

your
sweet
foot
what
makes

so
white
do
you
bathe
it
in
milk
nele
would
have
risen
from
his
side
but
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
asked
her
it
is
not
the
sun

that
shines
upon
us
now
and
paints
you
all
gold
do
not
cast
down

eyes
but
look
straight
into
mine
and
behold
the
pure
fire
that
flames
there
and
listen
my
love
hearken
to
me
dearest
now
is
midday
the
silent
hour
the
labourer
is
at
home
eating
his
dinner
of
soup
shall
we
not
also
feed
upon
our
love
oh
why
oh
why
have
i
not
yet
a
thousand
years
wherein
to
tell
at
your
knees
my
rosary
of
indian
pearls
golden
tongue
she
said
but
my
lord
the
sun
blazed
down
upon
the
white
hood
of
the
cart
and
a
lark
sang
high
over
the
clover
and
nele
leant
her
head
upon
the
shoulder
of
ulenspiegel
iii
after
a
while
lamme
came
back
to
the
cart
great
drops
of
sweat
pouring
off
him
and
he
puffing
and
blowing
like
a
dolphin
alas
he
cried
i
was
born
under
an
evil
star
for
no
sooner
had
i
run
and
caught
up
with
this
woman
than
i
found
that
she
was
not
a
woman
at
all
but
an
old
hag
rather
as
indeed
i
could
see
at
once
by
her
face
years
old
at
the
very
least
and
to
judge
by
her
she
had
never
been
married
for
all
that
she
inquired
of
me
in
a
harsh
voice
what
i
was
doing
there
carrying
my
great
fat
belly
about
in
the
clover
i
told
her
as
politely
as
i
could
that
i
was
looking
for
my
wife
who
had
lately
left
me
and
that
i
had
run
after
her
by
mistake
at
that
the
old
girl
told
me
that
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
return
at
once
whence
i
came
and
that
if
my
wife
had
left
me
she
had
indeed
done
well
seeing
that
all
men
are
thieves
and
rascals
heretics
unfaithful
poisoners
and
deceivers
of
women
and
she
threatened
to
set
her
dog
on
me
if
i
did
not
make
off
at
once
which
in
truth
i
did
incontinently
for
that
i
perceived
a
great
mastiff
lying
there
growling
at
her
feet
when
therefore
i
had
reached
the
boundary
of
the
field
i
sat
me
down
to
rest
myself
and
to
eat
a
bit
of
ham
and
i
was
between
two
suddenly
i
heard
a
great
noise
just
behind
me
and
turning
round
i
saw
the
old
girl
mastiff
no
longer
now
in
menacing
mood
but
wagging
his
tail
as
sweetly
as
possible
and
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
was
hungry
and
would
like
a
piece
of
my
ham
i
was
for
throwing
him
some
small
bits
when
all
at
once
his
mistress
appeared
on
the
scene
and
shouted
out
fiercely
the
man
seize
him
with
your
fangs
my
son
i
started
to
run
away
the
great
mastiff
hanging
on
to
me
by
my
breeks
and
now
he
had
bitten
off
a
piece
of
them
together
with
a
gobbet
of
my
own
flesh
the
pain
made
me
angry
and
i
turned
and
gave
him
such
a
smart
stroke
with
my
stick
upon
his
front
paws
that
i
must
have
broken
one
of
them
at
least
at
that
he
fell
down
crying
out
in
his
dog
language
mercy
the
which
i
granted
him
meanwhile
his
mistress
finding
no
stones
to
throw
at
me
had
begun
to
threaten
me
with
pieces
of
earth
and
bits
of
grass
so
i
made
good
my
retreat
and
is
it
not
a
sorry
thing
and
a
thing
most
unjust
and
most
cruel
that
because
a
girl
has
not
been
enough
to
find
some
one
to
marry
her
she
must
needs
go
and
take
her
revenge
on
a
poor
innocent
like
me
iv
some
while
after
these
happenings
when
nele
had
returned
to
her
home
with
katheline
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
came
to
bruges
they
were
at
the
place
called
the
lake
of
love
though
the
learned
folk
would
have
it
to
be
derived
from
that
is
the
water
belonging
to
the
order
of
monks
who
are
called
minims
be
this
as
it
may
here
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
sat
themselves
down
watching
those
that
passed
in
front
of
them
under
the
trees
the
green
branches
hung
over
the
pathway
like
a
vault
of
foliage
and
below
there
sauntered
both
men
and
women
youths
and
maids
clasping
each
other
hands
with
flowers
on
their
heads
walking
so
close
together
and
gazing
so
tenderly
into
each
other
eyes
that
they
seemed
to
see
nothing
else
in
all
the
world
save
themselves
alone
as
he
watched
them
the
thoughts
of
ulenspiegel
were
far
away
with
nele
and
his
thoughts
were
sad
thoughts
yet
his
words
were
of
another
colour
bidding
lamme
come
off
with
him
to
the
tavern
for
a
drink
but
lamme
paid
no
attention
to
what
tyl
was
saying
for
he
himself
was
absorbed
no
less
by
the
sight
of
those
loving
pairs
in
the
old
days
he
said
we
too
my
wife
and
i
were
wont
to
go
while
others
just
as
we
are
now
would
watch
us
alone
and
companionless
by
the
come
and
have
a
drink
said
ulenspiegel
belike
we
will
find
the
seven
at
the
bottom
of
a
pint
of
beer
that
but
a
drunkard
notion
answered
lamme
for
you
know
quite
well
that
the
seven
are
giants
and
taller
than
the
roof
of
the
church
of
sauver
itself
the
thoughts
of
ulenspiegel
were
still
with
nele
but
none
the
less
did
he
hope
to
find
perchance
good
quarters
in
some
inn
a
good
supper
and
a
comely
hostess
into
the
bargain
again
therefore
did
he
urge
his
companion
to
come
along
with
him
and
drink
but
lamme
would
not
listen
to
him
gazing
sadly
at
the
tower
of
notre
dame
and
addressing
himself
in
prayer
to
our
lady
somewhat
in
this
wise
o
blessed
lady
patroness
of
all
lawful
unions
suffer
me
i
pray
to
see
yet
once
again
the
white
neck
the
soft
and
tender
neck
of
my
love
come
and
drink
cried
ulenspiegel
belike
you
will
find
her
displaying
these
charms
of
hers
to
the
drinkers
in
the
tavern
how
dare
you
harbour
such
a
thought
cried
lamme
come
and
drink
repeated
ulenspiegel
your
wife
has
turned
innkeeper
without
a
doubt
and
thus
conversing
they
repaired
to
the
marché
du
samedi
and
entered
into
the
blauwe
lanteern
at
the
sign
of
the
blue
lantern
and
there
they
found
a
right
innkeeper
the
donkey
meanwhile
was
unharnessed
from
the
cart
and
was
put
up
in
the
stables
and
provided
with
a
good
feed
of
oats
our
travellers
themselves
ordered
supper
and
when
they
had
eaten
their
fill
they
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
till
morning
only
to
wake
up
and
eat
again
and
lamme
who
was
wellnigh
bursting
with
all
that
he
had
eaten
said
that
he
could
hear
in
his
stomach
a
sound
like
the
music
of
the
spheres
now
when
the
time
came
to
pay
the
bill
mine
host
came
to
lamme
and
told
him
that
the
total
amounted
to
six
patards
he
has
the
money
said
lamme
pointing
to
ulenspiegel
no
such
thing
said
ulenspiegel
what
about
that
said
lamme
i
have
got
it
said
ulenspiegel
here
a
nice
way
of
going
on
cried
the
innkeeper
i
shall
strip
your
doublet
and
shirt
from
the
two
of
you
suddenly
lamme
took
courage
of
all
he
had
been
drinking
and
if
i
choose
to
eat
and
to
drink
he
cried
yea
to
eat
and
to
drink
the
worth
of
florins
and
more
do
you
think
i
shall
not
do
so
do
you
think
that
this
belly
of
mine
is
not
the
equal
of
a
penny
god
life
up
to
now
i
have
fed
on
ortolans
but
you
never
have
you
carried
anything
of
that
sort
under
your
belt
of
greasy
hide
for
you
you
bad
man
must
needs
carry
your
suet
in
the
collar
of
your
doublet
far
otherwise
than
i
that
bear
three
inches
at
least
of
delicate
fat
on
this
good
belly
of
mine
at
this
the
innkeeper
fell
into
a
passion
of
rage
and
though
he
was
a
stammerer
he
began
to
talk
at
a
great
rate
and
the
greater
his
haste
the
more
he
stammered
and
spluttered
like
a
dog
that
has
just
come
out
of
the
water
ulenspiegel
began
to
throw
pellets
of
bread
at
him
and
lamme
growing
more
and
more
excited
continued
his
harangue
in
the
following
strain
and
now
what
do
you
say
for
here
have
i
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
pay
you
for
those
three
lean
chickens
forsooth
and
those
four
mangy
poulets
to
say
nothing
of
that
big
simpleton
of
a
peacock
that
parades
his
paltry
tail
in
the
stable
yard
and
if
your
very
skin
was
not
more
dry
than
that
of
an
ancient
cock
if
your
bones
even
now
were
not
falling
to
very
dust
within
your
breast
still
should
i
have
the
wherewithal
to
eat
you
up
you
and
your
slobbering
servant
there
your
and
your
cook
whose
arms
are
not
long
enough
to
scratch
himself
though
he
had
the
itch
and
do
you
see
he
continued
do
you
see
this
fine
bird
of
yours
that
for
the
sake
of
half
a
florin
would
have
deprived
us
of
our
doublet
and
our
shirt
say
what
is
your
own
wardrobe
worth
preposterous
chatterbox
that
you
are
and
i
will
give
you
three
liards
in
exchange
for
the
lot
but
the
innkeeper
who
by
this
time
was
beside
himself
with
rage
stammered
and
spluttered
more
and
more
while
ulenspiegel
went
on
throwing
pellets
of
bread
in
his
face
till
lamme
at
last
cried
out
again
in
a
voice
brave
as
a
lion
what
the
value
think
you
of
a
fine
donkey
with
a
splendid
nose
long
ears
large
chest
and
legs
as
strong
as
iron
florins
at
the
least
is
it
not
so
most
seedy
of
innkeepers
and
how
many
old
nails
have
you
pray
locked
fast
away
in
your
coffer
with
which
to
pay
the
price
of
so
fine
an
animal
more
than
ever
did
the
innkeeper
puff
and
blow
yet
dared
not
budge
an
inch
from
where
he
stood
and
lamme
said
again
and
what
is
the
value
think
you
of
a
fine
cart
of
finely
painted
in
crimson
and
furnished
with
a
hood
of
courtrai
cloth
for
protection
from
sun
and
rain
florins
at
the
least
is
it
not
so
and
how
much
is
florins
added
to
florins
answer
that
you
miser
that
can
not
even
count
and
now
since
it
is
market
day
and
since
your
paltry
tavern
happens
to
be
full
of
peasants
that
are
come
to
market
behold
i
will
put
up
my
cart
to
auction
and
my
donkey
too
and
i
will
sell
them
here
now
and
at
once
which
in
very
truth
he
did
for
all
they
that
were
there
knew
very
well
who
lamme
was
and
he
actually
realized
from
the
sale
of
his
donkey
and
cart
as
much
as
florins
and
ten
patards
and
he
jingled
the
money
under
the
innkeeper
nose
and
said
to
him
scent
you
not
the
savour
of
festivities
to
be
yea
answered
mine
host
but
under
his
breath
he
swore
that
if
ever
lamme
came
to
him
and
offered
to
sell
him
his
very
skin
he
would
buy
it
for
a
liard
and
make
of
it
an
amulet
for
a
charm
against
extravagance
meanwhile
there
was
a
sweet
and
young
woman
that
stood
in
the
yard
without
and
she
came
up
oftentimes
to
the
window
and
looked
at
lamme
but
withdrew
her
pretty
face
each
time
that
he
might
have
seen
her
and
the
same
evening
when
lamme
was
going
up
to
bed
stumbling
about
on
the
staircase
without
any
light
for
he
had
been
drinking
not
wisely
he
was
aware
of
a
woman
that
put
her
arms
round
him
and
greedily
kissed
his
cheek
and
mouth
and
his
nose
even
and
moistened
his
face
with
amorous
tears
and
then
left
him
but
lamme
who
was
thoroughly
drowsed
by
all
that
he
had
been
drinking
lay
down
straightway
and
went
to
sleep
and
on
the
morrow
he
departed
to
ghent
together
with
ulenspiegel
there
he
went
seeking
his
wife
in
all
the
cabarets
and
taverns
of
the
town
but
at
nightfall
he
rejoined
ulenspiegel
at
the
sign
of
the
singing
swan
v
now
king
philip
was
obstinate
as
a
mule
and
he
thought
that
his
own
will
ought
to
dominate
the
entire
world
as
if
it
had
been
the
will
of
god
himself
and
his
will
was
this
that
our
country
little
accustomed
as
it
was
to
obedience
should
now
curb
itself
under
an
ancient
yoke
without
obtaining
any
reforms
at
all
and
the
and
the
of
his
desire
was
the
aggrandizement
of
that
holy
mother
of
his
the
catholic
church
apostolic
and
roman
one
entire
universal
changeless
and
unalterable
and
this
was
his
will
for
no
other
reason
at
all
than
just
the
fact
that
it
was
his
will
and
in
this
he
was
like
some
woman
without
sense
that
tosses
about
all
night
upon
her
bed
as
though
it
were
a
bed
of
thorns
endlessly
tortured
by
her
own
imaginings
yes
he
would
say
o
most
holy
saint
philip
and
you
o
my
lord
god
if
only
i
could
turn
the
low
countries
into
a
common
grave
and
cast
therein
all
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
then
surely
they
would
return
to
thee
my
most
blessed
patron
and
to
thee
my
lady
virgin
mary
and
to
ye
my
good
masters
the
saints
and
saintesses
of
paradise
and
he
really
tried
to
do
as
he
said
so
that
he
was
more
roman
than
the
pope
and
more
catholic
than
the
councils
and
the
people
of
flanders
and
of
the
low
countries
began
to
grow
anxious
again
and
to
think
that
they
could
discern
in
the
distance
this
crowned
spider
working
in
the
sombre
house
of
the
escurial
reaching
out
his
long
claws
with
their
nippers
open
and
spreading
wide
the
web
in
which
he
might
enwrap
them
all
and
suck
them
white
of
their
blood
ulenspiegel
for
his
part
went
spreading
the
alarm
wherever
he
could
and
stirring
up
the
people
against
the
ravishers
of
his
country
and
the
murderers
of
his
parents
one
day
therefore
when
he
was
in
the
marché
du
vendredi
near
by
the
the
great
canon
ulenspiegel
lay
flat
down
on
his
stomach
in
the
middle
of
the
road
a
who
happened
to
be
passing
came
up
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
there
i
am
giving
my
nose
a
wetting
ulenspiegel
told
him
so
that
i
may
discover
where
this
great
wind
is
coming
from
next
a
carpenter
came
along
do
you
take
the
pavement
for
a
mattress
he
asked
before
long
said
ulenspiegel
there
are
some
that
will
be
taking
it
for
a
counterpane
a
monk
came
up
and
stopped
by
his
side
what
does
this
booby
here
he
entreats
your
blessing
lying
flat
at
your
feet
said
ulenspiegel
the
monk
gave
his
blessing
and
went
away
but
ulenspiegel
continued
where
he
was
with
his
head
pressed
to
the
earth
till
at
last
a
peasant
came
along
and
asked
him
what
he
was
listening
for
do
you
hear
some
noise
or
other
he
said
yes
replied
ulenspiegel
i
hear
the
wood
beginning
to
grow
that
wood
whence
many
a
faggot
shall
be
made
for
the
burning
of
poor
heretics
do
you
hear
aught
else
inquired
a
sergeant
of
the
commune
yes
said
ulenspiegel
i
hear
the
that
are
on
their
way
from
spain
if
you
have
anything
you
wish
to
save
bury
it
now
for
in
a
little
while
our
cities
will
not
be
safe
from
thieves
any
more
the
man
is
mad
said
the
sergeant
and
the
people
of
the
town
thought
so
too
vi
now
in
those
days
day
in
day
out
king
philip
of
spain
was
used
to
spend
his
time
fingering
old
papers
and
scribbling
and
writing
on
leaves
of
parchment
to
these
alone
did
he
confide
the
secrets
of
his
cruel
heart
for
he
loved
no
man
living
and
knew
that
none
loved
him
for
he
desired
to
direct
his
great
empire
by
himself
alone
and
like
a
weary
atlas
he
was
bowed
under
that
weight
melancholy
and
phlegmatic
by
nature
this
excess
of
work
was
consuming
a
body
that
was
already
none
too
strong
hating
as
he
did
every
happy
face
he
had
begun
to
hate
our
land
of
flanders
for
its
gaiety
if
for
nothing
else
and
he
hated
our
merchants
just
because
they
were
wealthy
and
luxurious
and
he
hated
our
nobility
just
because
they
were
free
in
speech
and
frank
in
manner
and
because
of
the
high
ardour
of
their
bravery
and
their
jovial
bearing
neither
had
he
forgotten
the
tale
that
was
told
how
as
early
as
the
year
the
cardinal
de
cousa
had
pointed
out
the
abuses
of
the
church
and
had
preached
the
need
of
reformation
since
which
time
the
revolt
against
the
pope
and
the
power
of
rome
had
begun
to
be
manifest
in
our
land
and
was
now
under
different
forms
and
sects
rife
in
every
head
like
water
boiling
in
a
kettle
with
the
lid
on
and
although
under
the
emperor
charles
the
papal
inquisition
had
already
been
the
death
by
burning
burying
alive
or
hanging
of
so
many
as
a
hundred
thousand
christians
and
although
the
property
of
these
unfortunates
had
gone
into
the
coffers
of
the
emperor
and
the
king
like
rain
falling
into
a
sink
philip
decided
that
this
was
not
enough
and
now
imposed
on
the
country
a
new
college
of
bishops
and
aspired
to
introduce
into
flanders
all
the
horrors
of
the
spanish
inquisition
and
the
town
heralds
sounded
their
trumpets
and
their
timbrels
and
declaimed
a
proclamation
to
the
effect
that
all
heretics
whether
men
women
or
girls
should
be
done
to
death
those
who
would
recant
their
heresies
were
to
be
hanged
but
those
who
were
obstinate
were
to
be
burnt
at
the
stake
the
women
and
girls
were
to
be
buried
alive
and
the
executioner
was
to
dance
upon
their
dead
bodies
and
the
flame
of
resistance
began
to
burn
and
run
through
all
the
country
vii
it
was
the
fifth
of
april
just
before
easter
and
the
counts
louis
of
nassau
de
culembourg
and
de
brederode
he
that
was
surnamed
hercule
the
toper
were
entering
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
of
brussels
together
with
three
hundred
gentlemen
they
were
come
to
seek
an
audience
of
the
governess
of
the
netherlands
madame
the
duchess
of
parma
and
were
mounting
the
great
stairway
of
the
palace
four
by
four
coming
at
length
into
the
hall
where
my
lady
was
seated
they
presented
their
petition
which
entreated
her
to
use
her
influence
with
king
philip
for
the
abolition
of
all
those
decrees
which
concerned
religion
and
the
introduction
into
flanders
of
the
spanish
inquisition
this
petition
which
afterwards
became
known
as
the
compromise
also
declared
that
in
our
already
disaffected
country
such
a
policy
as
the
introduction
of
the
inquisition
could
only
result
in
troubles
of
all
kinds
ruin
to
the
country
and
universal
misery
berlaymont
who
later
on
was
to
prove
so
treacherous
and
baneful
to
the
land
of
his
birth
stood
close
by
her
highness
and
mocked
at
the
poverty
of
certain
of
the
confederate
nobles
who
had
come
to
visit
her
have
no
fear
my
lady
he
told
her
they
are
nothing
but
beggars
and
by
these
words
he
implied
either
that
the
said
nobles
had
been
ruined
in
the
service
of
the
king
or
else
that
they
were
eager
to
emulate
the
luxury
of
the
great
lords
of
spain
and
thus
it
was
that
later
on
these
same
nobles
endeavoured
to
bring
ridicule
upon
the
words
of
berlaymont
by
saying
that
they
held
it
indeed
an
honour
to
be
esteemed
and
spoken
of
as
beggars
beggars
for
the
good
service
of
the
king
and
the
advantage
of
these
lands
and
from
that
time
they
began
to
wear
round
their
necks
a
golden
medal
carved
with
an
effigy
of
the
king
and
on
the
obverse
side
of
the
medal
were
two
hands
clasped
upon
a
beggar
wallet
with
these
words
writ
thereunder
to
the
king
faithful
even
unto
beggary
on
their
hats
and
bonnets
they
carried
also
little
golden
ornaments
made
in
the
form
of
hats
and
platters
and
all
this
time
lamme
went
carrying
his
portly
form
about
the
town
seeking
the
wife
that
he
never
found
viii
one
morning
ulenspiegel
said
to
lamme
come
with
me
let
us
go
and
present
our
compliments
to
a
certain
high
noble
i
wot
of
a
most
renowned
and
powerful
personage
will
he
tell
us
where
my
wife
is
asked
lamme
certainly
answered
ulenspiegel
if
he
knows
and
away
they
went
to
brederode
surnamed
hercule
the
toper
and
they
found
him
in
the
courtyard
of
his
house
what
do
you
want
with
me
he
demanded
of
ulenspiegel
to
speak
with
you
my
lord
speak
then
said
brederode
you
are
a
handsome
brave
and
powerful
nobleman
said
ulenspiegel
time
was
when
you
were
able
to
flatten
out
a
frenchman
in
full
armour
as
though
he
were
no
better
than
a
mussel
in
its
shell
but
if
you
are
brave
and
powerful
you
are
also
can
you
tell
us
therefore
why
you
wear
this
medal
inscribed
with
these
words
the
king
faithful
even
unto
beggary
yes
lamme
put
in
pray
tell
us
why
my
lord
but
brederode
made
no
answer
and
only
looked
very
hard
at
ulenspiegel
who
thereupon
continued
his
discourse
in
this
wise
and
why
pray
do
you
you
other
noble
lords
seek
to
be
faithful
to
the
king
even
unto
beggary
is
it
for
the
great
good
that
he
wishes
you
or
for
the
fair
friendship
that
he
bears
you
how
is
it
that
instead
of
being
faithful
to
the
king
even
unto
beggary
you
do
not
so
act
rather
that
the
brute
himself
may
be
despoiled
of
his
country
and
thus
be
made
faithful
for
ever
to
beggary
himself
and
lamme
nodded
his
head
to
show
his
agreement
with
what
his
friend
had
said
brederode
looked
at
ulenspiegel
with
his
keen
glance
and
smiled
with
pleasure
at
his
handsome
appearance
either
you
are
a
spy
of
king
philip
he
said
or
else
a
good
man
of
flanders
and
for
whichever
you
are
i
will
pay
you
your
due
so
saying
he
led
ulenspiegel
to
his
pantry
and
lamme
followed
close
behind
when
they
were
come
there
brederode
pulled
ear
till
the
blood
flowed
this
for
the
spy
he
said
but
ulenspiegel
remained
quite
quiet
and
said
nothing
then
brederode
pointing
to
a
pipkin
of
cinnamon
wine
bade
his
butler
bring
it
to
him
drink
said
brederode
this
for
the
good
fleming
ah
cried
ulenspiegel
good
fleming
means
sweet
tongue
for
cinnamon
verily
the
saints
themselves
do
not
know
the
likes
of
it
when
he
had
drunk
half
the
tankard
he
passed
the
remainder
to
lamme
and
who
said
brederode
who
is
this
papzak
this
that
needs
must
be
recompensed
for
having
done
nothing
this
said
ulenspiegel
is
my
friend
lamme
goedzak
and
whenever
he
drinks
mulled
wine
he
thinks
that
he
is
going
to
find
the
wife
he
has
lost
that
so
said
lamme
sucking
up
the
wine
from
the
goblet
most
devotedly
and
where
may
you
be
going
to
now
asked
brederode
in
quest
of
the
seven
said
ulenspiegel
the
seven
that
shall
save
the
land
of
flanders
and
who
may
they
be
asked
brederode
when
i
have
found
them
said
ulenspiegel
then
i
will
tell
you
but
lamme
who
was
grown
sprightly
with
what
he
had
been
drinking
suggested
to
ulenspiegel
that
they
should
go
there
and
then
to
the
moon
to
see
if
his
wife
perchance
was
there
all
right
said
ulenspiegel
if
you
provide
a
ladder
and
it
was
may
the
green
month
of
may
and
ulenspiegel
said
to
lamme
o
lamme
behold
the
lovely
month
of
may
ah
the
bright
blue
of
the
sky
the
joy
of
the
swallows
and
behold
the
branches
of
the
trees
how
they
are
all
red
with
sap
and
the
very
earth
is
in
love
verily
this
is
now
the
time
both
to
hang
and
to
burn
for
the
faith
for
they
are
ready
the
good
little
inquisitors
ah
what
noble
faces
they
have
and
theirs
is
the
power
to
correct
us
and
to
punish
us
and
to
degrade
and
hand
us
over
to
the
secular
judges
or
to
imprison
us
o
the
fine
month
of
may
and
to
take
us
captive
and
to
proceed
to
trial
against
us
without
serving
any
writ
and
to
burn
hang
behead
us
and
to
dig
the
grave
of
premature
death
for
our
women
and
our
girls
in
the
trees
the
chaffinch
is
singing
but
upon
him
that
is
rich
and
wealthy
the
good
inquisitors
have
cast
a
favourable
eye
and
it
is
the
king
himself
that
shall
enter
into
their
inheritance
then
go
my
girls
dance
in
the
meadows
to
the
sound
of
bagpipes
and
shawms
o
the
fine
month
of
may
and
the
ashes
of
claes
beat
upon
the
breast
of
ulenspiegel
on
on
said
he
to
lamme
happy
are
they
that
shall
keep
heart
high
and
sword
drawn
in
the
dark
days
that
are
coming
ix
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
each
mounted
upon
a
donkey
given
him
by
simon
simonsen
one
of
the
followers
of
the
prince
of
orange
went
riding
far
and
wide
warning
the
people
concerning
the
bloodthirsty
designs
of
king
philip
and
always
on
the
for
any
news
from
spain
they
frequented
all
the
markets
and
fairs
of
the
countryside
selling
vegetables
and
habited
like
peasants
one
day
as
they
were
returning
from
the
market
at
brussels
they
passed
a
stone
house
on
the
quai
aux
briques
and
there
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
they
beheld
a
beautiful
dame
dressed
all
in
satin
she
had
a
high
complexion
a
lively
look
in
her
eyes
and
her
neck
was
most
fair
to
behold
by
her
side
was
a
young
cook
to
whom
she
was
addressing
words
like
these
clean
me
this
saucepan
will
you
no
rusty
sauce
for
me
as
for
me
cried
ulenspiegel
poking
in
his
nose
at
the
window
any
kind
of
soup
is
good
enough
for
a
hungry
man
can
not
afford
to
be
particular
the
lady
turned
towards
him
and
who
she
said
who
is
this
little
man
i
wonder
that
must
needs
concern
himself
with
my
soup
alas
my
lovely
lady
said
ulenspiegel
if
only
you
will
consent
to
make
soup
in
my
company
i
will
teach
you
how
to
prepare
a
relish
of
a
sort
that
is
quite
unknown
to
lovely
ladies
who
stay
at
home
and
then
smacking
his
lips
i
am
hungry
he
said
hungry
for
what
she
asked
him
for
you
sure
he
a
nice
enough
looking
fellow
said
the
cook
to
her
mistress
let
him
come
in
a
while
and
tell
us
his
adventures
but
there
are
two
of
them
said
the
lady
i
look
after
the
other
said
the
cook
madame
said
ulenspiegel
it
is
true
that
there
are
two
of
us
i
and
my
poor
friend
lamme
here
whose
back
can
not
support
so
much
as
the
weight
of
a
hundred
pounds
yet
who
carries
in
his
stomach
five
hundred
pounds
at
the
least
of
food
and
drink
and
that
right
willingly
my
son
lamme
said
do
not
make
mock
of
me
unfortunate
that
i
am
for
my
belly
costs
a
deal
to
fill
at
any
rate
it
shall
not
cost
you
so
much
as
a
liard
said
the
lady
come
in
both
of
you
but
what
about
these
donkeys
of
ours
said
lamme
there
is
no
lack
of
fodder
answered
the
lady
in
the
stable
of
monsieur
le
comte
de
meghen
thereupon
the
cook
left
her
saucepan
and
led
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
into
the
stable
yard
they
still
riding
on
their
donkeys
who
now
began
to
bray
inordinately
hark
cried
ulenspiegel
hearken
to
the
fanfare
with
which
they
greet
their
coming
nourishment
they
are
blowing
their
trumpets
for
joy
the
poor
beasts
but
when
they
were
dismounted
ulenspiegel
said
to
the
cook
come
now
my
dear
tell
me
if
you
were
a
would
you
choose
for
your
mate
a
donkey
like
me
if
i
were
a
woman
the
cook
replied
i
would
desire
a
fellow
that
had
a
merry
countenance
what
are
you
then
asked
lamme
being
neither
woman
nor
i
am
a
maid
quoth
she
and
that
is
neither
woman
nor
into
the
bargain
now
do
you
understand
meantime
the
lady
was
inviting
ulenspiegel
to
drink
a
pint
of
bruinbier
and
to
partake
of
some
ham
a
gigot
a
pâté
and
some
salad
ulenspiegel
clapped
his
hands
ham
he
cried
that
good
to
eat
and
bruinbier
is
a
drink
divine
gigot
is
food
fit
for
the
gods
and
the
thought
of
a
pâté
is
enough
to
send
one
tongue
in
one
mouth
for
joy
a
rich
salad
is
worthy
victual
for
a
king
forsooth
but
blessed
above
all
men
shall
that
man
be
to
whom
it
is
given
to
dine
off
thy
loveliness
o
lady
mine
how
the
fellow
does
run
on
she
exclaimed
and
then
eat
first
you
rogue
shall
we
not
say
grace
ere
we
consume
all
these
dainties
said
ulenspiegel
nay
answered
the
lady
but
lamme
began
to
make
moan
complaining
that
he
was
hungry
eat
then
your
fill
said
the
beautiful
dame
for
well
i
see
that
you
have
no
other
thoughts
but
of
meats
well
cooked
and
fresh
withal
lamme
added
even
as
was
my
wife
at
this
the
cook
grew
moody
nevertheless
they
ate
and
drank
their
fill
and
that
night
also
did
the
beautiful
dame
give
his
supper
to
ulenspiegel
and
so
the
next
day
and
the
days
that
followed
as
for
the
donkeys
they
were
given
double
feeds
and
for
lamme
there
was
always
a
double
ration
and
throughout
a
whole
week
he
never
once
went
outside
the
kitchen
playing
the
wanton
with
many
a
dish
of
food
but
never
with
the
cook
for
he
was
thinking
of
his
wife
all
the
time
this
annoyed
the
girl
and
she
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
cumber
the
earth
if
one
thought
of
nothing
but
one
belly
but
all
this
time
ulenspiegel
and
the
beautiful
dame
were
passing
the
time
together
in
right
friendly
wise
till
one
day
she
said
to
him
tyl
i
think
you
have
no
principles
at
all
who
are
you
i
am
said
he
a
son
that
chance
begat
one
day
on
high
adventure
you
are
not
afraid
to
speak
well
of
yourself
she
told
him
that
for
fear
that
others
will
praise
me
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
help
such
of
your
brethren
who
have
suffered
for
the
faith
the
ashes
of
claes
beat
upon
my
breast
there
is
something
splendid
about
you
tyl
when
you
say
that
she
told
him
but
who
is
this
claes
he
was
my
father
answered
ulenspiegel
that
was
burnt
alive
for
the
faith
verily
you
are
not
at
all
like
my
husband
the
count
de
meghen
she
said
for
he
if
he
could
would
bleed
to
death
the
country
that
i
love
for
you
must
know
that
i
was
born
in
the
glorious
city
of
antwerp
and
now
i
will
make
known
to
you
that
the
count
has
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
councillor
of
brabant
to
bring
into
that
very
city
of
antwerp
a
regiment
of
infantry
i
must
inform
the
citizens
of
this
said
ulenspiegel
behold
i
will
go
there
immediately
swift
as
a
ghost
he
departed
there
and
then
and
by
the
following
morning
the
citizens
of
antwerp
were
in
arms
but
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
having
sent
their
donkeys
to
a
farmer
that
was
a
friend
of
simon
simonsen
were
themselves
obliged
to
go
into
hiding
for
fear
of
the
count
de
meghen
who
was
seeking
for
them
everywhere
to
have
them
hanged
for
it
had
been
reported
to
him
that
there
were
two
heretics
that
had
drunk
of
his
wine
and
eaten
of
his
meat
and
he
was
jealous
and
spoke
concerning
this
matter
to
his
lovely
dame
who
ground
her
teeth
in
anger
and
wept
and
swooned
seventeen
times
the
cook
behaved
in
a
similar
fashion
but
swooned
not
so
often
and
swore
by
her
hope
of
paradise
and
by
the
eternal
salvation
of
her
soul
that
neither
she
nor
her
mistress
had
done
anything
wrong
unless
it
had
been
to
give
what
was
left
of
their
dinner
to
a
couple
of
poor
pilgrims
who
mounted
on
two
wretched
donkeys
had
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
kitchen
window
all
that
day
there
was
a
great
shedding
of
tears
so
that
the
floors
of
the
house
became
quite
damp
with
them
and
when
he
saw
this
monsieur
de
meghen
felt
reassured
that
he
was
being
told
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
lamme
did
not
dare
to
show
himself
again
there
for
the
cook
always
jeered
at
him
calling
after
him
my
wife
and
for
this
cause
he
was
very
sorry
for
himself
thinking
of
all
the
good
food
that
he
was
missing
but
ulenspiegel
continued
his
visits
to
the
beautiful
dame
entering
the
house
by
the
rue
and
hiding
himself
in
the
storeroom
and
he
always
took
care
to
bring
back
to
lamme
some
dainty
morsel
now
one
evening
the
count
de
meghen
informed
his
lady
that
before
morning
dawned
he
was
resolved
to
lead
his
into
the
city
of
when
he
had
told
her
this
he
went
to
sleep
but
the
beautiful
dame
went
straightway
to
the
storeroom
and
apprised
ulenspiegel
of
what
had
happened
x
ulenspiegel
in
the
garb
of
a
pilgrim
and
with
no
provision
of
food
or
money
departed
incontinently
for
with
the
intention
of
warning
the
citizens
he
reckoned
to
find
a
horse
at
the
house
of
jeroen
praet
the
brother
of
simon
simonsen
for
whom
he
carried
letters
from
the
prince
from
thence
he
would
go
by
side
roads
to
as
fast
as
his
horse
would
carry
him
as
he
was
crossing
the
road
he
spied
a
company
of
soldiers
coming
towards
him
this
gave
him
a
great
fright
because
of
the
letters
which
he
carried
but
being
resolved
to
put
the
best
face
on
the
misadventure
he
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
soldiers
with
all
the
courage
at
his
command
standing
still
by
the
roadside
telling
his
beads
when
the
soldiers
came
up
with
him
he
joined
them
and
soon
discovered
that
they
also
were
going
to
at
the
head
of
the
troop
marched
a
company
of
walloons
led
by
a
captain
lamotte
by
name
with
his
bodyguard
of
six
halberdiers
then
followed
the
other
officers
each
according
to
rank
and
with
a
smaller
bodyguard
the
provost
with
his
halberdiers
and
two
bailiffs
the
chief
watchman
with
the
the
executioner
with
his
assistants
and
a
band
of
drums
and
fifes
making
a
great
row
thereafter
came
a
company
of
flemish
soldiers
two
hundred
strong
with
their
captain
and
his
they
were
divided
into
two
divisions
each
of
one
hundred
men
under
the
command
of
two
sergeants
and
in
squads
of
ten
under
the
command
of
corporals
the
provost
and
his
lieutenants
were
likewise
preceded
by
a
band
of
drums
and
fifes
beating
and
screaming
behind
these
again
came
two
open
wagons
wherein
rode
the
loving
companions
of
the
soldiers
pealing
with
laughter
twittering
like
birds
singing
like
nightingales
eating
drinking
dancing
standing
lying
down
or
sitting
astride
all
gay
and
pretty
girls
many
of
them
were
dressed
like
but
in
fine
white
cloth
which
was
cut
away
at
the
arms
and
legs
and
at
the
neck
so
as
to
show
their
sweet
white
flesh
and
on
their
heads
they
wore
bonnets
of
fine
linen
trimmed
with
gold
and
surmounted
with
magnificent
ostrich
plumes
that
fluttered
in
the
wind
their
belts
were
of
cloth
of
gold
crimped
with
red
satin
from
which
hung
the
scabbards
of
their
daggers
made
of
cloth
of
gold
and
their
shoes
their
stockings
their
hose
their
doublets
and
fitments
were
all
of
gold
and
white
silk
others
there
were
dressed
also
in
the
uniform
of
infantrymen
but
with
uniforms
of
divers
colours
blue
green
scarlet
and
crimson
cut
away
and
embroidered
or
emblazoned
according
to
their
fancy
but
on
the
arm
of
each
and
all
was
to
be
seen
the
coloured
band
that
indicated
her
calling
the
girls
were
in
charge
of
a
sergeant
who
did
his
best
to
keep
them
in
order
but
they
made
no
pretence
of
obeying
him
but
bombarded
him
with
japes
and
sweet
grimaces
so
that
he
found
it
hard
to
keep
his
countenance
ulenspiegel
meanwhile
in
his
dress
of
a
pilgrim
and
telling
his
beads
went
marching
along
by
the
side
of
the
two
and
their
guard
for
all
the
world
like
a
little
boat
by
the
side
of
a
big
ship
suddenly
lamotte
inquired
of
him
whither
he
was
going
sir
captain
answered
ulenspiegel
who
was
growing
hungry
you
must
know
that
i
am
one
that
has
committed
a
grievous
sin
for
which
i
have
been
condemned
by
the
chapter
of
notre
dame
to
journey
to
rome
on
foot
and
to
ask
pardon
there
from
the
holy
father
this
he
has
granted
and
now
i
am
shriven
and
suffered
to
return
to
my
own
country
on
the
one
condition
that
i
am
to
preach
the
holy
mysteries
to
whatsoever
soldiers
i
may
encounter
on
the
way
and
they
for
their
part
are
enjoined
to
give
me
bread
and
wine
in
return
for
my
preaching
and
thus
by
my
sermons
do
i
sustain
my
wretched
life
would
you
now
give
me
permission
to
fulfil
my
vow
at
the
next
halt
i
will
said
monsieur
de
lamotte
after
this
ulenspiegel
began
to
mingle
with
the
walloons
and
flemings
in
right
brotherly
fashion
but
all
the
time
he
kept
fingering
those
letters
which
he
kept
concealed
under
his
doublet
and
the
girls
began
to
cry
out
to
him
come
hither
handsome
pilgrim
come
hither
and
show
us
the
strength
of
your
pilgrim
and
ulenspiegel
drew
nigh
to
them
with
modest
mien
and
said
o
my
sisters
in
god
pray
you
do
not
make
mock
of
the
poor
pilgrim
that
wendeth
up
hill
and
down
dale
preaching
ever
the
holy
faith
to
the
soldiers
but
with
his
eyes
he
feasted
himself
upon
the
sight
of
their
sweet
charms
and
the
wanton
girls
thrusting
their
lively
faces
betwixt
the
canvas
curtains
of
the
wagons
cried
out
to
him
yet
the
more
surely
you
are
too
young
a
man
to
go
preaching
to
soldiers
climb
up
into
our
wagon
and
we
will
teach
thee
more
gentle
subjects
of
conversation
and
right
willingly
would
ulenspiegel
have
done
as
they
bade
him
but
he
dared
not
by
reason
of
the
letters
which
he
carried
and
already
two
of
the
girls
were
leaning
out
of
the
wagon
trying
to
hoist
him
up
with
their
white
round
arms
but
the
sergeant
was
jealous
be
off
with
you
or
else
i
off
with
your
head
he
threatened
so
ulenspiegel
removed
himself
away
but
not
without
a
sly
look
behind
him
at
the
fresh
young
beauty
of
those
joysome
girls
all
golden
in
the
sun
which
now
shone
brightly
they
came
at
last
to
berchem
where
philip
de
lannoy
lord
of
beauvoir
ordered
a
halt
for
he
it
was
that
was
in
command
of
the
flemings
now
in
that
place
was
an
of
medium
height
but
despoiled
of
all
its
branches
save
one
only
a
big
branch
that
was
broken
off
short
in
the
middle
for
only
a
month
before
an
anabaptist
had
been
hanged
there
by
the
neck
here
then
the
soldiers
came
to
a
halt
and
the
keepers
of
the
canteen
came
up
and
began
to
sell
to
them
bread
wine
beer
with
meats
of
every
kind
and
to
the
gay
girls
they
sold
all
manner
of
sugared
sweets
and
castrelins
and
almonds
and
tartlets
the
which
when
ulenspiegel
saw
he
felt
hungrier
than
ever
all
at
once
ulenspiegel
climbed
up
like
a
monkey
into
the
tree
and
seated
himself
astride
on
the
big
branch
seven
feet
above
the
ground
at
the
least
and
then
when
he
had
given
himself
a
few
strokes
from
his
pilgrim
scourge
he
began
his
sermon
while
the
soldiers
and
their
gay
girls
sat
round
him
in
a
circle
it
is
written
he
began
that
whosoever
giveth
to
the
poor
the
same
lendeth
to
god
very
well
then
o
soldiers
present
here
and
you
fair
ladies
sweet
comrades
in
love
of
all
these
valiant
warriors
do
you
lend
now
to
god
that
is
to
say
give
me
i
beg
you
some
of
your
bread
meat
wine
beer
if
you
please
and
eke
your
tartlets
and
i
promise
you
that
god
who
is
very
rich
shall
give
you
back
in
exchange
many
pieces
of
ortolan
rivers
of
malmsey
wine
mountains
of
and
great
pieces
of
that
lovely
rystpap
which
they
eat
in
paradise
from
silver
spoons
then
changing
to
a
more
sorrowful
tone
he
continued
behold
now
with
what
cruel
tortures
do
i
strive
to
merit
pardon
for
my
sins
will
you
do
nothing
to
assuage
the
smarting
pain
of
this
scourge
by
which
my
back
is
lacerated
till
the
blood
flows
who
is
this
madman
cried
the
soldiers
my
friends
answered
ulenspiegel
i
am
no
madman
but
one
that
is
repentant
even
to
the
point
of
starvation
for
while
my
soul
weeps
for
its
sins
my
stomach
weeps
for
want
of
food
good
soldiers
and
you
fair
damosels
i
see
you
well
provided
with
ham
and
goose
with
fat
sausages
and
wine
and
beer
and
all
manner
of
tartlets
will
you
not
give
so
much
as
a
morsel
to
the
wandering
pilgrim
yes
yes
we
will
cried
the
flemish
soldiers
for
the
preacher
hath
a
merry
countenance
and
now
they
all
began
to
throw
him
chunks
of
bread
as
though
they
had
been
balls
and
ulenspiegel
did
not
cease
from
talking
and
from
eating
astride
as
he
was
on
the
branch
hunger
he
said
makes
a
man
hard
of
heart
and
little
apt
for
prayer
yet
a
piece
of
ham
removes
that
evil
disposition
in
no
time
look
out
for
your
head
shouted
a
sergeant
as
he
threw
him
a
bottle
half
full
of
wine
ulenspiegel
caught
the
bottle
in
and
began
to
drink
in
little
gulps
talking
all
the
while
if
hunger
sharp
and
raging
is
bane
to
the
poor
body
of
a
pilgrim
there
is
something
else
that
is
equally
harmful
to
his
soul
nothing
less
than
his
fear
that
the
generosity
of
his
soldier
friends
may
lead
him
on
to
drunkenness
for
as
a
general
rule
the
pilgrim
is
a
right
sober
fellow
but
when
as
now
one
soldier
gives
him
a
slice
of
ham
and
another
a
bottle
of
beer
he
is
mightily
afraid
lest
by
drinking
thus
upon
an
empty
or
nearly
empty
stomach
he
may
lose
his
head
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
caught
hold
of
the
leg
of
a
goose
that
came
whizzing
to
him
through
the
air
this
truly
is
a
miracle
he
cried
that
one
should
go
fishing
in
the
air
for
a
bird
of
the
field
and
see
hey
presto
it
has
disappeared
bone
and
all
verily
what
is
it
that
is
greedier
than
dry
sand
i
will
tell
you
a
barren
woman
and
a
hungry
man
scarcely
had
he
spoken
than
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
face
for
two
tartlets
had
flattened
themselves
one
on
his
eye
the
other
on
his
cheek
the
gay
girls
who
had
thrown
them
laughed
aloud
but
ulenspiegel
made
answer
many
thanks
my
pretties
many
thanks
for
thus
embracing
me
with
this
jammy
accolade
nevertheless
the
tartlets
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
then
suddenly
the
drums
began
to
beat
the
fifes
screamed
and
the
soldiers
fell
in
again
monsieur
de
beauvoir
ordered
ulenspiegel
to
come
down
from
his
tree
and
to
march
by
the
side
of
the
soldiers
ulenspiegel
would
willingly
have
been
parted
from
them
by
a
hundred
leagues
for
he
had
gathered
from
the
remarks
let
fall
by
certain
that
he
was
already
under
suspicion
and
that
he
ran
danger
of
being
arrested
for
a
spy
and
if
this
was
so
he
knew
that
they
would
most
certainly
search
his
pockets
and
have
him
hanged
when
they
found
the
letters
which
he
carried
so
in
a
little
while
he
purposely
let
himself
stumble
into
the
ditch
which
ran
by
the
wayside
and
as
he
fell
he
cried
out
loudly
mercy
soldiers
mercy
my
leg
is
broken
and
now
i
can
not
walk
any
more
you
must
let
me
get
up
into
the
cart
with
the
girls
but
to
this
he
knew
that
the
jealous
sergeant
would
never
consent
the
girls
meanwhile
cried
out
from
the
carts
come
come
jolly
pilgrim
and
we
will
succour
you
and
caress
and
make
much
of
you
and
cure
you
all
in
a
day
i
know
it
said
ulenspiegel
for
a
woman
hand
is
balm
celestial
for
all
and
every
wound
but
the
jealous
sergeant
consulted
with
monsieur
de
lamotte
saying
sir
i
suspect
that
this
pilgrim
is
playing
some
trick
upon
us
with
his
tale
of
a
broken
leg
all
he
wants
is
to
have
the
chance
of
getting
up
into
the
cart
with
the
girls
order
him
rather
to
be
left
behind
on
the
road
very
well
answered
monsieur
de
lamotte
so
ulenspiegel
was
left
where
he
was
in
the
ditch
some
soldiers
who
really
believed
that
his
leg
was
broken
were
sorry
for
him
because
of
his
gaiety
and
they
left
with
him
a
two
ration
of
food
and
wine
and
the
girls
would
have
got
down
and
run
to
his
assistance
but
as
this
was
forbidden
they
threw
him
all
that
was
left
of
their
castrelins
as
soon
as
the
soldiers
had
disappeared
in
the
distance
ulenspiegel
still
in
his
pilgrim
dress
recovered
his
liberty
purchased
a
horse
and
rode
like
the
wind
by
roads
and
to
when
he
told
them
the
news
of
the
approach
of
monsieur
de
lamotte
the
townspeople
flew
to
arms
to
the
number
of
eight
hundred
men
and
they
chose
out
their
leaders
and
sent
off
ulenspiegel
disguised
as
a
to
antwerp
to
summon
help
from
hercule
brederode
surnamed
the
toper
and
the
soldiers
of
de
lamotte
and
de
beauvoir
were
able
to
gain
no
entry
into
most
vigilant
of
cities
most
valiant
in
defence
xi
one
day
simon
simonsen
said
to
ulenspiegel
hearken
brother
mine
and
tell
me
are
you
a
brave
man
think
you
brave
enough
answered
ulenspiegel
to
whip
a
spaniard
to
death
to
kill
an
assassin
or
to
murder
a
murderer
do
you
think
you
could
hide
yourself
in
a
chimney
and
wait
there
patiently
so
as
to
overhear
what
was
being
said
in
the
room
below
god
has
given
me
strong
legs
answered
ulenspiegel
and
a
supple
back
and
in
virtue
of
these
gifts
i
could
stand
a
long
time
in
whatever
position
i
would
like
a
cat
have
you
patience
and
a
good
memory
asked
simon
the
ashes
of
claes
beat
upon
my
breast
answered
ulenspiegel
very
well
then
said
simon
you
will
take
this
playing
card
folded
as
you
see
it
and
you
will
go
to
dendermonde
to
a
house
a
drawing
of
which
i
will
give
you
and
you
will
knock
at
the
door
twice
loudly
and
once
softly
some
one
will
open
to
you
and
will
ask
if
you
are
the
you
will
answer
that
you
are
he
and
that
you
have
not
lost
the
card
then
you
will
show
the
card
to
him
who
opened
the
door
after
that
tyl
you
must
do
as
best
you
can
for
great
are
the
evils
that
are
against
the
land
of
flanders
and
you
will
be
conducted
to
a
chimney
that
has
been
swept
and
cleaned
against
your
arrival
and
in
it
you
will
find
a
series
of
strong
made
ready
for
you
to
climb
by
and
a
little
wooden
shelf
securely
fastened
to
the
side
of
the
chimney
for
a
seat
and
when
he
that
has
opened
the
door
shall
direct
you
you
will
climb
up
into
your
and
there
remain
in
the
chamber
below
and
in
front
of
the
chimney
where
you
will
be
hidden
a
conference
is
to
be
held
between
certain
noble
lords
william
the
silent
prince
of
orange
and
the
counts
de
hoorn
de
hoogstraeten
and
ludwig
of
nassau
the
brother
of
william
and
we
reformers
desire
to
find
out
whether
these
noble
lords
are
able
and
willing
to
undertake
the
saving
of
our
country
well
on
the
first
day
of
april
ulenspiegel
did
as
he
had
been
bidden
and
took
up
his
place
in
the
chimney
luckily
for
him
there
was
no
fire
in
the
grate
and
it
seemed
that
the
absence
of
smoke
would
not
make
it
any
the
less
easy
for
him
to
hear
properly
after
a
little
while
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
ulenspiegel
was
pierced
through
and
through
by
a
draught
of
cold
wind
blowing
up
the
chimney
but
he
endured
the
wind
with
patience
telling
himself
that
it
would
serve
to
keep
him
alert
and
attentive
after
a
while
he
could
hear
my
lords
of
orange
egmont
and
the
rest
making
their
entrance
into
the
room
they
began
by
speaking
of
the
fears
they
felt
of
the
wrath
of
the
king
and
of
the
maladministration
of
the
revenue
and
finances
of
the
country
one
of
them
spoke
in
a
sharp
clear
and
haughty
tone
of
voice
which
ulenspiegel
recognized
as
that
of
my
lord
of
egmont
just
as
he
recognized
de
hoogstraeten
by
his
husky
tones
and
de
hoorn
by
his
loud
voice
the
count
ludwig
of
nassau
by
his
firm
and
soldierly
manner
of
speech
and
william
the
silent
by
that
slow
deliberate
way
of
enunciating
his
words
as
if
they
had
all
been
thought
out
beforehand
and
weighed
in
a
balance
the
count
asked
why
they
had
been
summoned
to
this
second
conference
when
they
had
had
plenty
of
time
at
hellegat
to
come
to
a
decision
on
what
they
meant
to
do
de
hoorn
replied
that
the
days
passed
quickly
that
the
king
was
growing
angry
and
that
they
must
be
careful
to
lose
no
time
then
spake
william
the
silent
the
country
is
in
danger
it
must
be
defended
against
the
attack
of
a
foreign
army
at
this
grew
excited
and
said
that
he
was
indeed
astonished
to
hear
that
the
king
his
master
had
thought
it
necessary
to
send
an
army
when
all
was
so
peaceful
by
reason
of
the
watchful
care
of
their
noble
lordships
and
of
himself
especially
but
william
the
silent
made
answer
king
philip
already
has
an
army
in
the
low
countries
consisting
of
not
less
than
fourteen
regiments
of
artillery
and
they
are
under
the
control
of
him
who
commanded
them
at
gravelines
a
general
to
whom
all
the
soldiers
are
devoted
said
that
he
could
scarcely
believe
it
i
will
say
no
more
said
william
but
there
are
certain
letters
which
shall
be
read
to
you
and
to
the
assembled
lords
and
to
begin
with
letters
from
the
poor
prisoner
monsieur
de
montigny
and
in
these
letters
it
was
told
how
that
the
king
was
extremely
vexed
with
what
was
happening
in
the
low
countries
and
that
when
the
hour
was
come
he
had
determined
to
punish
the
fomenters
of
disturbance
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
the
count
complained
of
the
cold
and
desired
to
have
the
fire
lit
the
which
was
done
while
the
two
lords
continued
their
discussion
of
those
letters
now
it
was
a
big
fire
of
wood
but
it
did
not
burn
well
on
account
of
that
big
obstruction
which
was
hidden
in
the
chimney
and
the
room
became
quickly
full
of
smoke
then
the
count
de
hoogstraeten
began
to
read
for
all
that
he
was
coughing
continually
because
of
the
smoke
certain
letters
which
had
been
intercepted
on
their
way
from
alava
the
spanish
ambassador
to
the
governess
of
the
netherlands
the
ambassador
he
said
writes
that
all
the
evil
that
has
happened
in
the
low
countries
was
the
work
of
three
men
the
lords
of
orange
egmont
and
hoorn
but
it
were
desirable
he
adds
to
appear
well
disposed
to
these
three
and
to
tell
them
that
the
king
recognizes
that
it
is
thanks
to
them
that
their
lands
have
been
kept
loyal
to
him
as
for
the
two
others
montigny
and
de
berghes
let
them
alone
where
they
are
ah
said
ulenspiegel
i
had
rather
a
smoky
chimney
in
the
land
of
flanders
than
a
damp
prison
in
the
land
of
spain
for
garrotters
grow
between
damp
walls
but
the
count
de
hoogstraeten
continued
the
said
ambassador
adds
that
on
one
occasion
the
king
being
in
the
city
of
madrid
spoke
these
words
all
accounts
that
come
from
the
low
countries
it
is
evident
that
our
royal
reputation
is
diminished
and
we
are
ready
therefore
to
abandon
all
our
other
possessions
rather
than
leave
such
a
rebellion
unpunished
we
are
decided
to
proceed
to
the
netherlands
in
person
and
to
claim
the
assistance
of
the
pope
and
of
the
emperor
for
beneath
the
present
evil
is
concealed
a
future
good
we
shall
reclaim
the
low
countries
to
absolute
obedience
and
according
to
our
own
will
we
shall
modify
the
constitution
of
that
state
its
religion
and
its
government
ah
king
philip
said
ulenspiegel
if
only
i
could
modify
yours
to
mine
verily
you
would
suffer
under
the
blows
of
my
trusty
flemish
stick
a
wondrous
modification
of
your
thighs
and
arms
and
legs
i
would
fix
your
head
in
the
middle
of
your
back
with
a
couple
of
nails
and
as
you
viewed
from
this
position
the
you
have
created
you
should
sing
at
your
good
ease
a
pretty
song
of
tyrannous
modification
now
wine
was
brought
and
de
hoogstraeten
rose
upon
his
feet
and
said
i
drink
to
our
country
and
every
one
followed
his
example
and
when
he
had
finished
the
toast
he
threw
his
empty
tankard
down
on
the
table
and
said
now
sounds
an
evil
hour
for
the
nobility
of
belgium
let
us
take
counsel
as
to
how
we
may
best
defend
ourselves
he
awaited
some
response
and
looked
at
but
he
uttered
not
a
word
and
it
was
left
to
william
of
orange
to
break
the
silence
we
can
offer
resistance
he
said
provided
that
the
count
who
at
and
at
gravelines
has
twice
made
france
to
tremble
and
who
holds
complete
sway
over
the
flemish
soldiery
provided
that
he
i
repeat
is
willing
to
come
to
our
assistance
in
our
endeavour
to
prevent
the
spaniard
from
entering
the
fatherland
to
this
my
lord
of
egmont
made
answer
i
have
too
much
respect
for
the
king
to
think
that
it
is
right
that
we
should
take
up
arms
against
him
like
rebels
let
those
who
fear
his
wrath
retire
before
it
i
shall
remain
where
i
am
for
i
have
no
means
of
living
if
i
am
deprived
of
his
help
philip
knows
how
to
avenge
himself
most
cruelly
said
william
the
silent
i
trust
him
answered
you
would
trust
him
with
your
heads
asked
ludwig
of
nassau
head
body
and
soul
replied
friend
faithful
and
true
i
will
do
likewise
said
de
hoorn
but
william
said
it
behoves
us
to
be
and
not
to
wait
for
things
to
happen
and
then
my
lord
of
egmont
spoke
again
very
excitedly
i
have
arrested
reformers
at
grammont
he
said
and
if
their
preachings
come
to
an
end
and
if
punishment
is
meted
out
to
the
iconoclasts
the
anger
of
the
king
will
be
appeased
but
william
said
these
are
mere
hopes
let
us
arm
ourselves
with
trust
said
let
us
arm
ourselves
with
trust
echoed
de
hoorn
it
is
cold
steel
rather
than
trust
that
should
be
our
weapons
replied
de
hoogstraeten
whereupon
william
the
silent
made
a
sign
to
the
effect
that
he
wished
to
depart
adieu
prince
without
a
country
said
the
count
adieu
prince
without
a
head
answered
william
the
sheep
are
for
the
butcher
said
ludwig
of
nassau
but
glory
waits
the
soldier
that
saves
the
land
of
his
fathers
that
i
can
not
said
neither
do
i
desire
to
may
the
blood
of
the
victims
fall
once
again
upon
the
head
of
the
flatterer
said
ulenspiegel
and
then
those
lords
retired
whereupon
did
ulenspiegel
come
down
from
his
chimney
and
go
straightway
to
carry
the
news
to
praet
and
the
latter
said
is
nothing
better
than
a
traitor
but
god
is
with
the
prince
the
duke
the
duke
at
brussels
where
are
the
safes
and
coffers
that
have
wings
xii
william
the
silent
went
in
the
way
by
god
appointed
as
for
the
two
counts
they
had
already
given
themselves
up
to
the
duke
of
alba
who
offered
pardon
to
william
as
well
if
only
he
would
appear
before
him
at
this
news
ulenspiegel
said
to
lamme
my
good
friend
what
do
you
think
now
the
duke
has
sent
out
a
summons
through
dubois
the
by
which
the
prince
of
orange
ludwig
his
brother
de
hoogstraeten
van
den
bergh
culembourg
de
brederode
and
other
friends
of
the
prince
are
cited
to
appear
before
him
within
forty
days
and
if
they
do
this
they
are
assured
of
justice
and
mercy
but
listen
lamme
and
i
will
tell
you
a
story
one
day
there
was
a
jew
of
amsterdam
who
summoned
one
of
his
enemies
to
come
down
and
join
him
in
the
street
for
the
jew
was
standing
on
the
pavement
but
his
enemy
was
looking
out
of
a
window
just
above
down
at
once
said
the
jew
i
will
give
you
such
a
blow
on
the
head
as
will
squash
it
down
into
your
chest
so
that
your
two
eyes
will
look
out
from
your
sides
like
the
eyes
of
a
thief
from
betwixt
but
the
other
answered
if
you
promised
me
a
hundred
times
as
much
still
i
would
not
come
down
even
so
may
the
prince
of
orange
and
his
friends
make
reply
to
him
that
summons
them
and
so
they
did
refusing
to
appear
before
the
duke
but
the
counts
and
de
hoorn
were
not
of
this
mind
and
their
failure
to
do
their
duty
brought
them
nearer
to
their
doom
xiii
one
day
in
june
a
fine
warm
day
it
was
a
scaffold
was
set
up
in
the
market
square
at
brussels
in
front
of
the
town
hall
the
scaffold
was
draped
in
black
and
close
to
it
were
two
tall
posts
tipped
with
steel
on
the
scaffold
were
a
couple
of
black
cushions
and
a
little
table
with
a
silver
cross
thereon
and
on
this
scaffold
were
beheaded
the
noble
counts
and
de
hoorn
and
the
king
entered
into
their
inheritance
and
it
was
of
the
count
that
the
ambassador
of
francis
spake
saying
this
day
have
i
seen
a
man
beheaded
who
twice
made
the
kingdom
of
france
to
tremble
and
the
heads
of
the
two
counts
were
placed
upon
the
posts
with
the
iron
tips
and
ulenspiegel
said
to
lamme
with
a
black
cloth
have
they
covered
both
their
flesh
and
their
blood
verily
blessed
now
are
they
who
keep
heart
high
and
sword
drawn
in
the
dark
days
that
are
coming
xiv
in
those
days
william
the
silent
gathered
together
an
army
and
invaded
the
country
of
the
netherlands
from
three
sides
and
ulenspiegel
was
at
a
meeting
of
his
countrymen
at
marenhout
and
they
were
wild
with
anger
and
he
addressed
them
in
this
wise
know
you
my
friends
that
king
philip
has
taken
counsel
with
the
holy
inquisition
and
by
their
advice
he
has
declared
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
netherlands
to
be
guilty
of
high
treason
and
the
charge
against
them
is
one
of
heresy
namely
that
either
they
are
heretics
themselves
or
else
that
they
have
put
no
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
spread
of
heretical
doctrine
and
for
this
execrable
crime
the
king
has
condemned
them
all
without
regard
to
age
or
sex
to
suffer
the
appropriate
penalties
all
except
a
few
here
and
there
that
are
exempted
by
name
and
there
is
no
hope
of
grace
or
pardon
and
the
king
will
enter
into
their
inheritance
for
the
scythes
of
death
are
busy
through
all
the
wide
land
that
borders
the
north
sea
the
duchy
of
emden
the
of
amise
and
the
countries
of
westphalia
and
of
cleves
of
juliers
and
liége
together
with
the
bishoprics
of
cologne
and
treves
and
the
lands
of
france
and
lorraine
the
scythes
of
death
are
busy
over
more
than
three
hundred
leagues
of
our
soil
and
in
two
hundred
of
our
walled
towns
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
boroughs
in
the
countrysides
and
villages
and
level
lands
of
the
whole
country
and
the
king
is
taking
all
for
his
own
and
i
tell
you
ulenspiegel
continued
that
eleven
thousand
executioners
will
not
be
too
many
for
this
business
but
the
duke
of
alba
calls
them
soldiers
and
all
the
land
of
our
fathers
is
become
a
fugitive
are
all
the
arts
of
peace
and
all
the
crafts
and
industries
abandon
us
now
to
enrich
those
foreign
lands
which
still
permit
a
man
to
worship
at
home
the
god
of
conscience
but
here
the
scythes
of
death
are
busy
and
the
king
takes
all
for
his
own
our
country
as
you
know
had
gained
various
privileges
by
gifts
of
money
to
princes
when
they
were
in
need
but
now
these
privileges
have
all
been
annulled
and
as
the
result
of
many
an
agreement
made
between
ourselves
and
our
overlords
we
had
hoped
to
enjoy
the
wealth
that
came
to
us
as
the
fruit
of
our
labours
yet
were
we
deceived
the
builded
for
the
incendiary
the
labourer
laboured
for
the
thief
and
the
king
takes
all
for
his
own
blood
and
tears
everywhere
naught
but
blood
and
tears
for
the
scythes
of
death
are
busy
busy
at
the
places
of
execution
and
at
the
trees
that
serve
for
gallows
by
the
roadsides
and
at
many
an
open
grave
wherein
are
thrown
the
living
bodies
of
our
maids
and
they
are
busy
in
the
prison
dungeons
and
within
those
circles
of
faggots
that
flame
around
the
victims
scorching
them
little
by
little
to
death
or
in
the
huts
of
straw
where
they
fall
suffocated
in
the
fire
and
the
smoke
and
the
king
takes
all
for
his
own
and
this
forsooth
by
the
will
of
the
pope
of
rome
the
very
cities
teem
with
spies
that
await
their
share
of
the
plunder
the
richer
one
is
the
more
likely
one
is
to
be
found
guilty
and
the
king
takes
all
for
his
own
but
never
shall
the
valiant
men
of
flanders
suffer
themselves
to
be
butchered
thus
like
lambs
for
among
those
who
fly
away
for
refuge
there
are
some
who
carry
arms
and
these
are
hiding
in
the
woods
the
monks
verily
have
denounced
them
and
hold
themselves
free
to
kill
them
and
take
possession
of
their
goods
but
by
night
and
day
these
refugees
banded
together
like
wild
beasts
rush
down
upon
the
monasteries
and
seize
the
money
that
has
been
stolen
from
the
poor
and
take
it
away
under
the
form
of
candlesticks
and
reliquaries
of
gold
and
silver
ciboria
and
patens
and
other
precious
vessels
of
the
kind
do
i
not
speak
truth
my
friends
and
they
drink
therefrom
that
wine
which
the
monks
had
been
keeping
for
themselves
and
when
melted
down
or
mortgaged
these
vessels
will
serve
to
provide
money
for
the
holy
war
long
live
the
beggarmen
and
even
now
they
begin
to
harass
the
soldiers
of
the
king
killing
and
plundering
then
back
into
their
lairs
and
in
the
woods
by
day
and
night
are
to
be
seen
the
fires
which
have
been
lit
during
the
hours
of
darkness
flaring
up
or
dying
down
and
ever
breaking
out
in
some
fresh
place
these
are
the
fires
of
our
banquetings
all
for
us
the
game
of
the
woods
both
furred
and
feathered
we
are
the
masters
here
and
the
peasants
load
us
with
bread
and
bacon
whenever
we
are
in
need
look
at
them
lamme
fierce
and
talkative
resolute
and
proud
of
bearing
they
wander
through
the
woods
and
they
are
armed
with
hatchets
and
halberds
and
with
long
swords
and
bragmarts
with
arquebuses
pikes
lances
and
crossbows
for
any
kind
of
weapon
is
good
enough
for
such
brave
men
and
they
need
no
officers
to
lead
them

drank
in
his
turn
from
a
golden
goblet
that
had
once
belonged
to

or
other
and
proudly
he
gazed
on

xv
william
the
silent
with
his
army
was
at
the
gates
of
liége
but
before
crossing
the
meuse
he
made
sundry
marches
and
leading
the
duke
astray
for
all
his
vigilance
ulenspiegel
applied
himself
most
diligently
to
his
duties
as
a
soldier
worked
his
arquebus
most
skilfully
and
kept
his
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
now
at
that
time
there
arrived
in
the
camp
certain
gentlemen
of
flanders
and
brabant
and
these
lived
in
friendly
fashion
with
the
colonels
and
captains
of
the
prince
following
but
soon
there
came
into
being
two
parties
in
the
camp
who
began
to
dispute
one
with
the
other
continually
some
saying
that
william
was
a
traitor
others
that
such
accusation
was
a
gross
libel
on
the
prince
and
that
they
who
had
made
it
should
be
forced
to
eat
their
words
suspicion
grew
and
grew
like
a
spot
of
oil
and
at
length
they
came
to
blows
small
companies
of
six
eight
or
a
dozen
men
fighting
together
in
single
combat
with
all
kinds
of
weapons
and
sometimes
with
arquebuses
even
one
day
the
prince
hearing
the
noise
came
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
walked
straight
in
between
the
combatants
it
chanced
that
a
piece
of
shot
hit
his
sword
and
struck
it
from
his
side
he
stopped
the
combat
and
visited
the
whole
camp
intending
to
put
an
end
once
for
all
to
these
combats
and
to
these
cries
of
death
to
william
death
to
the
war
now
the
day
after
this
adventure
ulenspiegel
had
been
to
the
house
of
a
walloon
maiden
to
sing
to
her
some
flemish
of
his
and
it
was
near
midnight
and
very
misty
and
ulenspiegel
being
just
about
to
leave
the
house
thought
he
heard
the
cawing
of
a
crow
three
times
repeated
and
the
sound
came
from
the
door
of
a
cottage
close
by
and
from
far
off
came
other
cawings
three
times
repeated
as
if
in
answer
presently
a
peasant
made
his
appearance
at
the
doorway
of
the
cottage
and
at
the
same
time
ulenspiegel
heard
steps
on
the
road
two
men
came
up
to
the
peasant
and
began
to
talk
to
him
in
the
spanish
tongue
the
peasant
spoke
to
them
also
in
spanish
well
and
how
goes
it
asked
the
cottager
well
indeed
the
two
men
answered
we
have
been
spreading
rumours
on
behalf
of
the
king
and
it
is
thanks
to
us
that
the
captains
and
their
soldiers
are
everywhere
suspicious
and
talking
among
themselves
in
this
wise
prince
so
the
gossip
goes
is
resisting
the
king
for
vile
ambition
and
for
nothing
else
for
by
this
means
he
thinks
to
make
himself
feared
so
that
he
may
acquire
cities
and
overlordships
as
the
price
of
peace
for
five
hundred
thousand
florins
he
would
leave
in
the
lurch
all
the
brave
nobles
who
have
come
out
to
fight
for
their
country
and
it
is
a
fact
that
the
duke
has
offered
him
a
complete
amnesty
and
has
promised
to
restore
both
him
and
his
chief
officers
in
their
possessions
if
only
the
prince
will
return
to
the
obedience
of
the
king
and
will
negotiate
with
him
alone
but
they
that
remain
faithful
to
the
prince
make
answer
to
us
in
this
wise
no
means
will
william
have
aught
to
do
with
the
proposals
of
the
duke
for
these
are
but
snares
and
treachery
for
the
prince
must
surely
call
to
mind
what
happened
to
and
de
hoorn
and
it
is
well
known
that
the
cardinal
de
granville
said
at
rome
when
the
two
counts
had
been
taken
the
two
gudgeon
verily
have
been
caught
but
the
pike
has
been
allowed
to
escape
for
nothing
has
been
taken
while
william
still
remains
at
large
is
the
camp
divided
in
twain
then
asked
the
peasant
it
is
replied
the
two
men
and
the
division
grows
greater
every
day
but
whom
are
those
letters
for
whereupon
they
all
entered
into
the
cottage
a
lantern
was
lit
inside
and
looking
through
a
crack
in
the
door
ulenspiegel
could
see
them
unsealing
two
letters
these
they
read
with
every
appearance
of
enjoyment
and
then
they
all
fell
to
drinking
after
which
the
two
men
came
out
of
the
cottage
and
said
to
the
peasant
still
speaking
in
spanish
the
camp
split
in
two
and
the
prince
captured
that
will
be
worth
a
dozen
glasses
eh
those
men
said
ulenspiegel
to
himself
can
not
longer
be
allowed
to
live
but
even
now
they
were
disappearing
in
the
thick
mist
with
the
lantern
which
the
peasant
had
brought
for
them
the
light
of
the
lantern
shone
out
intermittently
as
if
continually
intercepted
by
some
dark
body
from
this
ulenspiegel
concluded
that
the
two
men
must
be
walking
one
behind
the
other
he
raised
his
arquebus
to
his
shoulder
and
fired
then
he
saw
the
lantern
raised
and
lowered
several
times
as
if
the
man
who
carried
it
was
looking
at
his
fallen
comrade
trying
to
discover
where
he
had
been
hit
and
the
nature
of
the
wound
yet
again
did
ulenspiegel
raise
his
arquebus
and
then
when
the
lantern
began
to
steady
itself
and
to
retreat
speedily
towards
the
camp
he
fired
again
now
the
lantern
swayed
fell
to
the
ground
and
went
out
leaving
all
in
darkness
ulenspiegel
ran
on
to
the
camp
and
there
he
soon
encountered
the
provost
with
a
number
of
soldiers
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
noise
of
the
firing
ulenspiegel
accosted
them
saying
i
am
the
huntsman
go
you
now
and
find
the
game
brave
fleming
said
the
provost
methinks
you
are
a
man
that
knows
other
ways
of
talking
besides
with
your
tongue
words
of
the
tongue
they
are
but
so
much
wind
answered
ulenspiegel
but
words
of
lead
they
know
how
to
find
for
themselves
a
lasting
habitation
in
the
carcass
of
a
traitor
come
then
follow
me
and
so
saying
he
led
them
to
the
place
where
the
two
men
had
fallen
and
in
very
deed
the
soldiers
saw
by
the
light
of
their
lanterns
two
bodies
stretched
out
on
the
ground
one
was
dead
and
the
other
at
the
last
gasp
holding
his
hand
to
his
heart
and
in
his
hand
a
letter
all
crumpled
in
the
agony
of
death
the
soldiers
lifted
the
two
bodies
whose
clothes
clearly
showed
them
to
be
the
bodies
of
gentlemen
and
straightway
carried
them
still
by
the
light
of
their
lanterns
to
the
prince
now
william
was
about
to
hold
a
council
with
frederick
of
hollenhausen
the
margrave
of
hesse
and
other
nobles
but
the
soldiers
who
had
now
been
joined
by
a
company
of
other
troopers
in
green
and
yellow
jackets
stood
before
the
tent
demanding
with
shouts
and
cries
that
the
prince
should
give
them
audience
at
length
william
of
orange
came
out
to
them
and
the
provost
began
to
clear
his
throat
and
make
other
preliminaries
for
the
accusation
of
ulenspiegel
but
the
latter
cut
in
before
him
saying
my
lord
i
had
thought
to
kill
two
crows
but
i
have
killed
two
traitors
in
their
stead
two
noblemen
belonging
to
your
suite
then
he
told
the
story
of
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
done
william
did
not
utter
a
word
but
the
two
bodies
were
carefully
examined
in
the
presence
of
ulenspiegel
himself
and
william
the
silent
together
with
frederick
of
hollenhausen
the
margrave
of
hesse
dietrich
of
schoonenbergh
count
albert
of
nassau
the
count
de
hoogstraeten
and
antoine
de
lailang
governor
of
malines
and
the
soldiers
stood
by
with
lamme
goedzak
his
great
belly
all
of
a
tremble
sealed
letters
were
found
on
the
persons
of
the
deceased
gentlemen
which
had
been
sent
by
granvelles
and
noircames
and
engaged
the
recipients
to
sow
division
in
the
prince
entourage
and
by
that
means
to
diminish
his
power
and
to
compel
him
to
yield
so
that
he
might
ultimately
be
delivered
up
to
the
duke
and
beheaded
according
to
his
deserts
the
right
procedure
is
continued
the
letter
to
act
at
first
with
caution
and
to
use
allusive
phrases
only
so
that
the
army
may
be
led
to
think
that
the
prince
has
already
come
to
a
secret
understanding
with
the
duke
for
his
own
advantage
this
will
arouse
the
anger
of
his
captains
and
soldiers
and
they
will
assuredly
take
him
prisoner
now
as
a
reward
for
this
service
it
appeared
that
notes
to
the
value
of
some
five
hundred
ducats
were
being
sent
them
on
the
fugger
bank
at
antwerp
and
they
were
promised
a
thousand
more
as
soon
as
the
four
hundred
thousand
ducats
which
were
already
on
their
way
from
spain
had
arrived
in
zeeland
the
whole
plot
having
been
now
unmasked
the
prince
turned
in
silence
towards
the
gentlemen
lords
and
soldiers
who
stood
round
him
many
of
these
men
he
knew
to
be
suspicious
of
him
already
nevertheless
he
pointed
at
the
two
bodies
without
speaking
a
word
intending
by
this
gesture
to
reproach
them
for
their
mistrust
and
at
this
every
one
present
there
exclaimed
and
shouted
aloud
long
live
the
prince
of
orange
the
prince
is
faithful
and
true
and
such
was
their
anger
that
they
were
desirous
to
throw
the
two
dead
bodies
to
the
dogs
but
william
forbade
them
saying
it
is
not
these
two
poor
corpses
that
deserve
to
be
thrown
to
the
dogs
so
much
as
that
littleness
of
mind
which
must
needs
be
suspicious
of
the
purest
intentions
and
the
lords
and
soldiers
cried
out
again
long
live
the
prince
long
live
the
prince
of
orange
the
friend
of
our
country
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
was
like
the
noise
of
thunder
threatening
injustice
and
the
prince
pointed
to
the
two
corpses
and
ordered
that
they
should
be
given
christian
burial
and
i
demanded
ulenspiegel
what
shall
be
done
to
me
faithful
and
true
if
i
have
done
evil
let
me
be
beaten
but
if
good
why
then
let
me
be
suitably
rewarded
then
the
prince
addressed
him
saying
this
soldier
is
to
receive
fifty
strokes
from
the
green
wood
in
my
presence
for
having
killed
two
gentlemen
without
orders
to
the
contempt
of
all
discipline
at
the
same
time
let
him
receive
a
reward
of
thirty
florins
for
having
used
his
eyes
and
ears
to
some
purpose
my
lord
answered
ulenspiegel
give
me
the
thirty
florins
first
and
i
shall
then
be
able
to
support
my
beating
with
equanimity
yes
yes
murmured
lamme
goedzak
give
him
the
thirty
florins
first
and
then
he
will
bear
the
rest
with
equanimity
one
thing
more
said
ulenspiegel
since
my
soul
is
admittedly
free
from
fault
is
there
any
real
reason
why
i
must
be
cleansed
with
the
wood
of
the
oak
or
washed
with
the
branch
of
the
no
murmured
lamme
again
ulenspiegel
surely
has
no
need
to
be
washed
or
cleansed
for
his
soul
is
without
stain
do
not
wash
it
my
masters
do
not
wash
it
but
when
ulenspiegel
had
received
the
thirty
florins
the
provost
ordered
him
to
give
himself
up
to
the
behold
my
lords
said
lamme
behold
how
piteous
he
looks
no
love
lost
between
the
hard
wood
and
him
my
beloved
ulenspiegel
but
ulenspiegel
answered
of
a
truth
i
love
a
fine
in
full
leaf
growing
up
towards
the
sun
in
all
its
native
verdure
but
i
agree
i
loathe
like
poison
these
heavy
cudgels
of
wood
with
their
sap
still
oozing
out
of
them
stripped
of
their
branches
and
without
any
leaves
or
twigs
growing
thereon
for
they
are
rough
to
look
upon
and
hard
to
feel
are
you
ready
demanded
the
provost
ready
ulenspiegel
repeated
ready
for
what
ready
to
be
flogged
do
you
mean
no
i
can
not
nor
will
i
be
flogged
by
you
you
have
a
red
beard
certainly
and
your
appearance
is
formidable
nevertheless
i
am
sure
that
you
have
a
kind
heart
and
would
have
no
desire
to
thrash
a
poor
fellow
like
me
and
now
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
should
be
loath
to
do
such
a
thing
myself
much
less
to
see
any
one
else
do
it
for
the
back
of
a
christian
is
a
sacred
thing
as
sacred
as
his
breast
which
holds
the
lungs
those
trusty
organs
whereby
we
breathe
the
goodly
air
of
god
and
think
how
bitter
would
be
your
remorse
if
a
too
brutal
blow
from
your
cudgel
should
chance
to
break
me
in
pieces
make
haste
said
the
my
lord
said
ulenspiegel
addressing
himself
to
the
prince
believe
me
there
is
no
need
for
all
this
hurry
first
of
all
the
wood
of
the
cudgel
ought
to
be
allowed
to
dry
for
i
have
heard
that
wood
while
still
green
is
like
to
communicate
a
mortal
poison
to
any
flesh
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
would
your
highness
desire
to
see
me
die
such
an
ugly
death
my
lord
my
back
i
hold
most
pitifully
at
your
service
have
it
flogged
if
you
must
with
rods
and
lashed
with
whips
but
unless
you
wish
to
see
me
dead
spare
me
i
pray
you
from
the
wood
while
it
is
still
green
have
mercy
on
him
prince
cried
my
lords
of
hoogstraeten
and
of
schoonenbergh
both
together
while
the
others
all
began
to
smile
compassionately
lamme
also
put
in
a
word
of
his
own
have
mercy
my
lord
green
wood
is
poison
neither
more
nor
less
than
rank
poison
the
prince
said
very
well
thereupon
ulenspiegel
leapt
in
the
air
again
and
again
and
smote
lamme
on
his
belly
and
compelled
him
to
dance
too
saying
join
me
now
in
praising
the
good
duke
who
has
delivered
me
from
the
green
wood
and
lamme
did
his
best
to
dance
but
could
not
very
well
because
of
his
belly
and
ulenspiegel
gave
him
to
eat
and
to
drink
as
much
as
he
was
able
xvi
it
was
now
at
the
end
of
october
the
prince
was
in
want
of
money
and
his
army
of
food
the
soldiers
too
began
to
murmur
and
he
marched
them
towards
the
french
frontier
to
offer
battle
to
the
duke
but
the
duke
would
not
fight
leaving
to
go
to
cambrésis
the
prince
army
fell
in
with
ten
companies
of
germans
and
eight
spanish
ensigns
and
three
cohorts
of
cavalry
they
at
once
joined
battle
and
in
the
midst
of
the
mêlée
was
ruffele
henricis
the
duke
son
crying
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
no
quarter
no
quarter
long
live
the
pope
now
don
henricis
found
himself
opposite
to
a
company
of
arquebusiers
which
was
led
by
ulenspiegel
and
he
threw
himself
upon
them
with
all
his
men
ulenspiegel
said
to
his
sergeant
i
will
cut
out
this
murderer
tongue
for
him
very
good
said
the
sergeant
and
ulenspiegel
took
careful
aim
and
his
bullet
shattered
the
tongue
and
the
entire
of
don
ruffele
henricis
son
of
the
duke
at
the
same
time
ulenspiegel
brought
down
the
son
of
the
marquess
delmares
and
in
a
little
while
more
the
eight
ensigns
and
the
three
cohorts
of
cavalry
were
thoroughly
worsted
after
this
victory
ulenspiegel
went
seeking
for
lamme
everywhere
through
the
camp
but
he
could
not
find
him
alas
he
said
he
is
gone
lamme
is
gone
my
friend
my
great
fat
friend
in
his
warlike
ardour
he
must
have
forgotten
how
heavy
his
belly
was
and
tried
to
follow
the
spaniards
in
their
flight
out
of
breath
he
must
have
fallen
like
a
sack
on
the
wayside
and
then
the
enemy
will
have
picked
him
up
for
ransom
a
ransom
of
good
christian
fat
o
lamme
my
friend
where
are
you
where
are
you
my
great
fat
friend
ulenspiegel
sought
him
everywhere
but
found
him
not
and
had
to
nurse
his
grief
in
silence
and
now
november
was
come
the
month
of
and
ulenspiegel
having
been
ordered
to
report
himself
before
william
found
the
prince
brooding
in
silence
and
biting
the
lacings
of
his
coat
of
mail
listen
to
me
the
prince
said
presently
and
give
me
your
whole
attention
ulenspiegel
answered
my
ears
are
like
the
gates
of
a
prison
one
enters
easily
but
to
get
out
again
is
a
different
matter
very
good
said
william
but
now
i
would
have
you
go
for
me
to
namur
and
to
flanders
hainaut
antwerp
and
to
gueldre
overyssel
and
the
north
of
holland
telling
the
people
everywhere
that
although
it
seems
that
the
fates
on
land
are
hostile
to
our
most
holy
and
christian
cause
we
will
yet
continue
the
struggle
by
sea
no
matter
what
the
evil
powers
that
are
arrayed
against
us
for
god
holds
the
issue
in
his
own
good
providence
whether
in
success
or
failure
and
when
you
are
come
to
amsterdam
you
will
render
an
account
of
all
that
you
have
done
to
paul
bruys
who
is
my
trusty
vassal
here
are
three
passports
signed
by
the
duke
of
alba
himself
which
were
found
on
certain
bodies
of
the
dead
at
my
secretary
has
filled
them
in
afresh
and
it
may
be
that
on
your
journey
you
will
meet
some
good
companion
in
whom
you
can
trust
let
him
go
with
you
and
those
are
to
be
accounted
trustworthy
who
know
how
to
answer
the
song
of
the
lark
with
a
warlike
cockcrow
here
are
fifty
florins
be
valiant
and
faithful
the
ashes
of
claes
beat
upon
my
heart
answered
ulenspiegel
and
he
went
his
way
xvii
now
the
passports
were
countersigned
both
by
the
king
and
the
duke
and
they
authorized
the
bearer
to
carry
any
kind
of
arms
at
his
convenience
so
ulenspiegel
took
with
him
his
trusty
arquebus
as
well
as
a
good
supply
of
cartridges
and
dry
gunpowder
he
dressed
himself
in
a
short
cloak
and
a
shabby
doublet
and
hose
made
after
the
spanish
fashion
and
thus
accoutred
with
a
plumed
cap
on
his
head
and
a
sword
at
his
side
he
made
his
departure
from
the
prince
army
where
it
lay
at
the
french
frontier
and
set
out
for
maestricht
the
roitelets
those
heralds
of
bad
weather
were
flying
around
the
houses
seeking
asile
from
the
storm
and
on
the
third
day
snow
fell
many
times
during
the
journey
did
ulenspiegel
have
to
show
his
but
they
always
let
him
pass
and
so
he
came
at
length
to
the
confines
of
liége
he
was
plodding
along
over
a
level
heath
and
a
fierce
wind
was
driving
the
swirling
snowflakes
against
his
face
and
in
front
and
on
every
side
the
heath
stretched
out
all
white
under
the
snow
that
fell
in
eddies
which
themselves
were
whirled
about
hither
and
thither
in
the
squalls
of
wind
and
there
were
three
wolves
that
began
to
follow
him
but
one
of
them
he
killed
with
a
shot
from
his
arquebus
and
the
other
two
flung
themselves
upon
their
wounded
comrade
and
then
made
off
into
the
woods
each
carrying
a
piece
of
the
corpse
delivered
from
this
peril
ulenspiegel
peered
about
him
fearing
lest
there
might
be
other
bands
of
wolves
in
that
country
but
he
saw
nothing
except
in
the
far
distance
certain
objects
that
looked
like
grey
statues
moving
slowly
along
in
the
falling
snow
behind
these
again
ulenspiegel
could
descry
the
dark
figures
of
a
couple
of
soldiers
on
horseback
to
see
the
better
what
all
this
might
portend
ulenspiegel
climbed
up
into
a
tree
and
there
the
wind
brought
to
him
a
sound
of
lamentation
it
may
be
ulenspiegel
said
to
himself
these
people
are
pilgrims
clad
in
white
habits
for
i
can
scarcely
distinguish
their
figures
against
the
snow
but
after
a
little
while
he
saw
that
they
were
men
running
quite
naked
and
that
behind
them
were
two
german
troopers
in
black
uniforms
riding
on
horses
and
they
were
driving
the
poor
wretches
in
front
of
them
with
whips
ulenspiegel
took
aim
with
his
arquebus
now
he
could
distinguish
the
individual
figures
of
that
mournful
company
old
men
and
young
men
naked
shivering
and
quaking
with
cold
hardly
able
to
stand
some
of
them
but
running
all
for
fear
of
the
cruel
whips
of
the
two
soldiers
who
themselves
being
warmly
clad
and
red
with
brandy
and
good
food
took
pleasure
in
lashing
the
bodies
of
naked
men
to
make
them
run
the
faster
ulenspiegel
said
you
shall
be
avenged
ashes
of
claes
and
he
killed
one
of
the
soldiers
outright
with
a
bullet
from
his
arquebus
the
soldier
fell
from
his
horse
and
his
companion
took
fright
not
knowing
whence
the
shot
had
come
but
concluding
that
his
assailant
must
be
hiding
somewhere
in
the
wood
he
decided
to
make
good
his
escape
together
with
the
horse
of
his
dead
companion
the
man
contrived
to
get
hold
of
the
horse
bridle
but
while
he
himself
was
dismounting
to
plunder
the
body
of
the
dead
he
was
hit
by
a
bullet
in
the
neck
and
fell
to
the
ground
as
for
the
naked
prisoners
they
imagined
that
some
angel
from
heaven
who
was
also
forsooth
a
fine
marksman
had
descended
from
the
sky
to
aid
them
and
they
all
fell
down
upon
their
knees
in
the
snow
at
this
ulenspiegel
descended
from
his
tree
and
was
at
once
recognized
by
the
company
who
had
previously
served
with
him
as
soldiers
in
the
armies
of
the
prince
they
said
to
him
o
ulenspiegel
we
are
come
from
france
and
we
were
being
driven
in
this
piteous
plight
to
maestricht
where
the
duke
is
to
be
treated
there
as
rebel
prisoners
because
we
can
not
pay
our
ransom
and
are
therefore
condemned
in
advance
to
be
tortured
cut
into
pieces
or
sent
to
row
like
caitiffs
and
criminals
in
the
galleys
of
the
king
ulenspiegel
gave
his
to
the
oldest
of
the
soldiers
saying
come
with
me
my
friends
i
will
accompany
you
as
far
as
mézières
but
first
of
all
let
us
strip
these
two
dead
soldiers
and
take
possession
of
their
horses
thereupon
the
doublets
hose
boots
and
of
the
soldiers
were
divided
up
among
the
sick
and
feeble
and
ulenspiegel
said
we
shall
soon
be
entering
the
wood
where
the
air
is
thicker
and
more
gentle
you
had
better
run
my
brothers
suddenly
one
of
the
men
fell
down
on
the
ground
crying
i
am
hungry
and
cold
and
i
am
going
to
god
to
bear
witness
that
the
pope
is
antichrist
on
earth
and
he
died
and
the
others
agreed
to
carry
the
body
with
them
that
it
might
be
given
christian
burial
while
thus
proceeding
along
the
road
they
met
a
peasant
driving
a
cart
with
a
canvas
hood
seeing
the
men
all
naked
the
peasant
had
compassion
on
them
and
invited
them
to
ride
in
his
cart
there
they
found
some
hay
to
lie
on
and
some
empty
sacks
to
cover
them
withal
and
they
were
warmed
and
gave
thanks
to
god
ulenspiegel
rode
beside
the
cart
on
one
of
the
two
horses
that
had
belonged
to
the
german
troopers
leading
the
other
by
the
bridle
at
mézières
they
all
alighted
good
hot
soup
and
beer
and
bread
and
cheese
were
handed
round
with
some
meat
for
the
older
men
and
women
and
they
were
nobly
entertained
and
they
were
clothed
and
armed
again
all
at
the
expense
of
the
commune
and
every
one
joined
in
giving
thanks
and
praise
to
ulenspiegel
who
received
it
gladly
ulenspiegel
also
sold
the
horses
of
the
german
troopers
for
florins
out
of
which
he
distributed
thirty
florins
among
the
frenchmen
thereafter
he
took
the
road
again
and
as
he
walked
solitarily
along
he
said
to
himself
verily
now
do
i
wander
through
a
land
of
ruin
blood
and
tears
nevertheless
i
find
nothing
those
spirits
lied
to
me
without
a
doubt
for
where
is
lamme
where
is
nele
where
are
the
seven
and
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
to
him
as
though
in
a
whisper
in
death
in
ruin
and
in
tears
seek
and
he
went
his
way
xviii
it
was
the
month
of
march
when
ulenspiegel
came
to
namur
there
he
found
lamme
who
having
conceived
a
violent
passion
for
the
fish
of
the
meuse
and
for
the
trout
especially
had
hired
a
boat
and
spent
all
day
fishing
in
the
river
by
permission
of
the
commune
but
for
this
privilege
he
had
been
obliged
to
pay
the
sum
of
fifty
florins
to
the
guild
of
the
fishmongers
some
of
his
fish
he
sold
but
the
rest
he
ate
himself
and
by
this
means
he
gained
a
finer
belly
than
ever
and
a
small
sack
of
money
when
he
saw
his
friend
and
comrade
walking
along
the
banks
of
the
meuse
and
about
to
enter
the
town
lamme
was
mightily
rejoiced
and
pushed
his
boat
to
the
shore
and
there
springing
on
to
the
bank
rushed
up
to
ulenspiegel
blowing
and
puffing
and
stammering
for
joy
here
you
are
he
cried
here
you
are
at
last
my
son
and
where
are
you
off
to
what
are
you
after
you
are
not
dead
then
and
have
you
seen
my
wife
you
feed
off
the
fish
of
the
meuse
which
are
the
best
to
be
found
anywhere
on
this
base
earth
and
let
me
tell
you
something
the
people
here
make
such
sauces
as
will
tempt
you
to
dip
your
fingers
into
the
dish
right
up
to
your
shoulder
ah
but
how
proud
and
splendid
you
look
on
your
cheeks
is
the
very
bloom
of
battle
and
here
you
are
it
you
it
really
you
my
son
my
ulenspiegel
you
jolly
vagabond
then
in
a
lower
tone
of
voice
he
added
and
how
many
spaniards
have
you
killed
you
have
not
seen
my
wife
by
any
chance
in
the
carts
with
those
other
hussies
ah
but
the
wine
of
the
meuse
you
must
taste
it
and
have
you
been
wounded
my
son
you
must
rest
here
a
while
so
fresh
and
cheery
as
you
are
and
vigilant
as
a
young
eagle
but
our
eels
you
must
taste
our
eels
no
muddy
taste
about
them
come
kiss
me
my
second
self
praise
be
to
god
how
glad
i
am
and
lamme
danced
and
leapt
in
the
air
puffing
and
blowing
and
compelling
ulenspiegel
to
dance
too
thereafter
they
walked
towards
namur
at
the
gate
of
the
city
ulenspiegel
showed
his
passport
signed
by
the
duke
and
lamme
conducted
him
to
his
house
while
their
repast
was
being
prepared
he
made
ulenspiegel
tell
him
all
his
adventures
and
then
recounted
his
own
telling
how
he
had
left
the
army
to
follow
a
girl
whom
he
thought
was
his
wife
it
was
in
pursuit
of
her
it
seemed
that
he
had
come
at
last
to
namur
and
he
kept
on
asking
ulenspiegel
are
you
sure
you
have
not
seen
her
anywhere
i
have
seen
many
other
beautiful
women
answered
ulenspiegel
and
in
this
town
especially
where
it
seems
they
are
all
most
amorous
it
is
so
said
lamme
nevertheless
i
have
remained
faithful
for
my
sad
heart
is
heavy
with
but
a
single
recollection
even
as
your
belly
is
heavy
with
countless
said
ulenspiegel
when
i
am
unhappy
i
have
to
eat
lamme
replied
your
unhappiness
knows
no
end
demanded
ulenspiegel
alas
no
said
lamme
and
helping
himself
to
another
trout
look
he
cried
look
how
lovely
and
firm
he
is
this
flesh
is
as
pink
as
the
flesh
of
my
wife
but
we
will
leave
namur
i
have
a
purseful
of
florins
and
we
will
buy
a
donkey
for
each
of
us
and
so
we
will
go
riding
away
to
the
land
of
flanders
you
will
be
giving
up
a
great
deal
said
ulenspiegel
never
mind
said
lamme
my
heart
draws
me
back
to
damme
for
it
was
there
that
my
love
loved
me
well
and
it
may
be
that
she
also
has
returned
thither
we
will
set
out
said
ulenspiegel
since
such
is
your
desire
and
in
fact
they
set
forth
as
lamme
had
said
each
on
a
donkey
and
so
they
rode
along
side
by
side
xix
nele
all
this
time
was
living
at
damme
sorrowful
and
alone
with
katheline
who
still
continued
to
call
amorously
for
her
cold
devil
who
never
came
ah
she
would
say
you
are
rich
hanske
my
pet
and
you
could
easily
give
me
back
those
seven
hundred
caroluses
then
soetkin
would
live
again
and
come
to
earth
once
more
and
claes
in
heaven
would
laugh
for
joy
easily
could
you
do
this
and
you
would
put
out
the
fire
my
soul
wants
to
get
out
and
with
her
finger
she
would
point
without
ceasing
to
the
place
on
her
head
where
the
flaming
tow
had
burned
her
katheline
was
very
impoverished
but
the
neighbours
helped
her
by
sending
in
beans
and
bread
and
meat
according
as
they
were
able
the
commune
also
gave
her
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
nele
did
sewing
for
the
wealthy
bourgeois
and
went
to
their
houses
to
mend
their
linen
earning
in
this
way
a
florin
or
two
every
week
but
katheline
kept
on
with
her
eternal
make
a
hole
let
out
my
soul
she
is
knocking
to
be
let
out
and
he
will
give
me
back
the
seven
hundred
caroluses
and
nele
wept
to
hear
her
xx
in
the
meantime
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
continued
their
wanderings
under
the
protection
of
their
passports
they
entered
one
day
into
a
little
tavern
built
against
the
rocks
of
the
sambre
the
which
rocks
are
covered
with
trees
here
and
there
and
on
the
sign
of
the
tavern
was
written
mine
host
name
marlaire
when
they
had
drunk
many
a
flask
of
wine
wine
of
the
meuse
rather
like
burgundy
and
when
they
had
eaten
a
large
plate
of
fish
they
fell
talking
to
the
innkeeper
who
was
a
keen
papist
but
as
talkative
as
he
was
pious
because
of
the
wine
he
had
been
drinking
and
he
kept
on
winking
his
eye
maliciously
ulenspiegel
had
a
suspicion
that
all
this
winking
portended
something
mysterious
and
he
made
the
fellow
drink
yet
more
with
the
result
that
he
fell
to
dancing
and
shouting
with
laughter
till
at
last
he
sat
himself
down
at
the
table
again
and
good
catholics
says
he
i
drink
to
you
and
to
you
we
drink
also
answered
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
and
i
drink
to
the
extinction
of
all
heresy
and
rebellion
we
will
join
you
in
that
toast
answered
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
who
kept
on
filling
up
the
goblets
which
mine
host
could
never
suffer
to
remain
full
you
are
good
fellows
said
the
innkeeper
let
me
drink
to
the
health
of
your
noble
generosities
for
you
must
know
that
i
derive
some
profit
from
all
the
wine
that
is
drunk
here
but
where
are
your
passports
here
they
are
replied
ulenspiegel
with
the
duke
signature
and
all
said
the
innkeeper
here
a
health
to
the
duke
to
the
duke
echoed
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
and
mine
host
went
on
talking
answer
me
now
do
you
know
what
it
is
that
they
catch
rats
and
mice
in
why
in
to
be
sure
and
who
is
the
mouse
then
the
great
heretic
of
orange
and
orange

is
in
very
truth
like
the
flames
of
hell
but
god
is
on
our
side

great
heretic

are
going
to
the
camp
answered
ulenspiegel
yes
they
will
do
their
work
well
and
one
fine
night
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
and
here
the
innkeeper
whistled
and
made
a
gesture
as
of
one
man
cutting
another
throat
cold
steel
i
tell
you
it
that
that
shall
prevent
the
black
bird
of
nassau
from
singing

more
come

a
gay
fellow
said
ulenspiegel
in
spite
of
being
married
the
innkeeper
said
i
am
neither
married
nor
have
i
ever
been
the
secrets
of
princes
are
safe
with
me
drink
but
if
i
had
a
wife
she
would
steal
my
secrets
from
under
my
pillow
to
get
me
hanged
and
herself
made
widow
before
the
time
long
live
god
they
will
come
but
where
are
the
new
passports
on
my
heart
of
a
christian
drink
they
are
there
there
i
tell
you
one
hundred
paces
along
the
road
near
by
do
you
see
them

said
ulenspiegel
yes
i
drink
and
drink
and
drink
to
the
king
to
the
duke
to
the
protestant
preachers
and
to
vent
wind
of
lead
and
i
drink
to
thee
and
to
me
to
the
wine
and
the
bottle
that
holds
it
but
why
it
is
you
that
have
stopped
drinking
and
at
each
new
toast
ulenspiegel
filled
up
the
glass
of
the
innkeeper
who
emptied
it
straightway
ulenspiegel
looked
at
him
for
some
time
then
rose
and
said
to
lamme
come
lamme
it
is
time
for
us
to
be
off
he
is
asleep
but
when
they
were
outside
he
has
no
wife
ulenspiegel
continued
we
are
safe
the
night
is
at
hand
did
you
hear
what
the
rascal
said
and
do
you
rightly
understand
who
these
three
preachers
are
do
you
realize
that
they
are
to
come
along
the
bank
of
the
meuse
from
and
that
it
will
be
our
part
to
await
them
on
the
road
and
then
for
vent
wind
of
lead
to
start
his
whistling
yes
said
lamme
it
is
for
us
to
save
the
prince
life
said
ulenspiegel
yes
said
lamme
wait
said
ulenspiegel
you
take
my
arquebus
and
go
and
hide
in
the
undergrowth
among
the
rocks
load
it
with
two
shots
and
shoot
when
you
hear
me
caw
and
crow
i
will
said
lamme
and
so
saying
he
disappeared
into
the
undergrowth
and
ulenspiegel
could
hear
quite
clearly
the
click
of
the
gun
as
lamme
loaded
it
do
you
see
them
coming
he
asked
presently
i
see
them
answered
lamme
there
are
three
of
them
marching
together
like
soldiers
and
one
of
them
is
much
taller
than
the
others
ulenspiegel
sat
himself
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
with
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
muttering
his
prayers
on
a
rosary
just
like
beggars
do
and
he
held
his
hat
between
his
knees
and
when
the
three
evangelists
passed
in
front
of
him
he
held
out
his
hat
as
though
asking
for
alms
but
they
gave
him
nothing
then
ulenspiegel
got
up
and
addressed
them
most
piteously
kind
sirs
he
said
do
not
refuse
a
patard
to
a
poor
quarryman
who
has
recently
had
an
accident
and
broken
his
back
by
falling
down
a
mine
the
people
in
this
part
of
the
world
are
hard
of
heart
and
they
have
not
been
willing
to
give
me
anything
to
relieve
my
distress
alas
give
me
but
a
patard
and
i
will
say
many
prayers
for
you
and
god
will
keep
you
happy
all
your
lives
long
kind
friends
my
son
said
one
of
the
evangelists
there
can
be
no
happiness
for
us
in
this
world
so
long
as
the
pope
and
the
inquisition
remain
in
power
ulenspiegel
heaved
another
sigh
alas
what
are
you
saying
my
lords
do
not
speak
so
loud
if
it
please
you
but
give
me
a
patard
my
son
replied
one
of
the
evangelists
he
that
was
the
smallest
of
the
three
and
of
a
very
warlike
countenance
we
poor
martyrs
carry
no
patards
save
only
just
enough
to
keep
us
going
on
our
journey
at
this
ulenspiegel
threw
himself
on
to
his
knees
in
front
of
them
give
me
your
blessing
then
he
said
the
three
evangelists
laid
their
hands
upon
the
head
of
ulenspiegel
albeit
with
little
signs
of
devotion
now
ulenspiegel
noticed
that
although
they
were
lean
of
figure
these
men
all
had
very
fat
stomachs
so
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
then
pretended
to
stumble
knocking
against
the
body
of
the
tall
evangelist
as
he
did
so
at
that
a
merry
tinkle
of
coin
was
distinctly
audible
thereupon
ulenspiegel
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
and
drew
his
dagger
my
good
man
he
said
it
is
cold
and
i
am
but
poorly
clad
but
methinks
you
have
too
much
about
you
give
me
some
of
your
wool
that
i
may
get
a
cloak
made
for
me
i
am
a
beggarman
long
live
the
beggarmen
the
tall
evangelist
made
answer
you
cock
of
a
beggarman
you
carry
your
crest
proudly
forsooth
and
we
are
going
to
cut
it
off
for
you
cut
it
off
then
cried
ulenspiegel
giving
ground
but
let
me
warn
you
that
trusty
wind
of
lead
is
going
to
sing
for
you
or
ever
he
sings
for
the
prince
my
master
beggar
i
am
long
live
the
beggarmen
the
three
evangelists
were
astounded
and
cried
out
to
each
other
how
does
he
know
we
are
betrayed
kill
him
long
live
the
mass
and
each
man
drew
forth
from
beneath
his
hose
a
sharp
dagger
but
ulenspiegel
without
waiting
for
them
to
attack
him
gave
ground
towards
the
bushes
where
lamme
was
hidden
and
when
he
judged
that
the
three
evangelists
were
within
range
of
the
arquebus
he
cried
out
crows
black
crows
the
wind
of
lead
is
going
to
whistle
i
sing
your
bitter
end
then
he
cawed
like
a
crow
and
a
shot
rang
out
from
the
bushes
and
the
tall
evangelist
fell
prone
on
the
earth
the
next
moment
followed
a
second
shot
which
accounted
in
the
same
way
for
the
second
and
from
among
the
bushes
ulenspiegel
saw
the
jolly
face
of
lamme
and
his
arm
raised
as
he
hastily
reloaded
his
arquebus
and
from
the
midst
of
the
dark
shrubbery
a
puff
of
blue
smoke
mounted
into
the
air
there
now
remained
but
one
evangelist
and
he
was
in
a
furious
rage
and
tried
to
cut
at
ulenspiegel
with
all
his
might
but
ulenspiegel
cried
wind
of
steel
or
wind
of
lead
which
matters
it
either
way
you
shall
quit
this
world
for
another
you
shameless
murderer
and
he
attacked
the
foe
and
defended
himself
most
bravely
so
they
stood
on
the
roadway
inflexible
face
to
face
giving
and
parrying
blows
now
ulenspiegel
was
covered
with
blood
for
his
opponent
was
an
experienced
fencer
and
had
wounded
him
on
the
hands
and
on
the
legs
but
ulenspiegel
attacked
and
defended
himself
like
a
lion
still
the
blood
which
began
to
flow
from
his
head
blinded
him
and
he
retreated
continually
trying
to
wipe
away
the
blood
with
his
left
hand
but
every
moment
feeling
weaker
and
he
would
most
certainly
have
been
killed
had
not
lamme
brought
down
the
third
evangelist
with
another
shot
from
his
arquebus
and
ulenspiegel
saw
him
fall
and
heard
him
vomit
forth
blasphemies
and
blood
and
the
white
froth
of
death
and
once
again
the
blue
smoke
drifted
up
above
the
dark
shrubbery
in
the
midst
of
which
lamme
displayed
yet
again
his
jolly
face
have
you
finished
him
off
he
asked
yes
my
son
replied
ulenspiegel
but
come
lamme
then
coming
out
of
his
saw
ulenspiegel
all
covered
with
blood
he
ran
like
a
stag
in
spite
of
his
fat
belly
and
came
to
ulenspiegel
where
he
sat
by
the
three
dead
men
he
is
wounded
lamme
cried
my
gentle
friend
is
wounded
by
the
rascally
murderer
and
then
with
a
vicious
kick
at
the
jaw
of
the
evangelist
who
lay
nearest
to
him
you
can
not
answer
me
ulenspiegel
are
you
going
to
die
my
son
where
is
the
ointment
ha
i
remember
now
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
his
satchel
under
the
sausages
ca
you
hear
me
speak
ulenspiegel
alas
there
is
no
warm
water
here
to
wash
your
wound
and
no
way
of
getting
any
the
water
of
the
sambre
will
have
to
do
instead
but
speak
to
me
my
friend
you
are
not
so
badly
hurt
after
all
surely
a
little
water
there
it
cold
is
it
but
he
is
waking
up
it
i
your
friend
and
your
enemies
are
all
dead
oh
where
is
some
linen
some
linen
to
bind
up
his
wounds
there
is
any
what
am
i
to
do
ah
my
shirt
that
must
serve
presently
ulenspiegel
opened
his
eyes
and
raised
himself
from
the
ground
with
his
teeth
all
chattering
because
of
the
cold
and
here
you
are
standing
up
already
lamme
exclaimed
it
is
a
balm
of
much
virtue
said
ulenspiegel
balm
of
valiance
answered
lamme
and
then
taking
the
bodies
of
the
evangelists
one
by
one
he
cast
them
into
a
hole
in
the
rocks
leaving
their
weapons
and
their
clothes
upon
them
but
he
took
their
cloaks
and
all
around
in
the
sky
the
crows
were
beginning
to
caw
to
each
other
in
anticipation
of
the
feast
and
the
sambre
flowed
by
like
a
river
of
steel
under
the
grey
sky
and
the
snow
fell
washing
the
blood
away
yet
they
felt
ill
at
ease
and
lamme
said
i
had
rather
kill
a
chicken
than
a
man
and
they
mounted
again
upon
their
donkeys
and
when
they
arrived
at
the
gates
of
huy
the
blood
was
still
trickling
from
the
head
of
ulenspiegel
so
they
dismounted
and
pretended
to
have
a
quarrel
and
to
use
their
daggers
on
one
another
with
the
utmost
ferocity
as
it
seemed
but
when
they
had
finished
their
duel
they
remounted
their
donkeys
and
came
into
the
town
showing
their
passports
at
the
city
gates
the
women
seeing
ulenspiegel
wounded
and
bleeding
while
lamme
rode
his
donkey
as
though
he
had
been
the
victor
threw
many
a
glance
of
tender
commiseration
upon
ulenspiegel
and
pointed
their
fingers
at
lamme
saying
that
is
the
rascal
who
wounded
his
friend
lamme
all
this
time
was
anxiously
scrutinizing
the
crowd
hoping
to
discover
his
wife
among
them
but
all
was
in
vain
and
he
was
sad
at
heart
xxi
where
are
you
going
now
said
lamme
to
maestricht
answered
ulenspiegel
but
stay
my
son
i
have
heard
that
the
army
of
the
duke
is
camped
all
round
the
city
and
that
he
himself
is
within
our
passports
will
be
of
no
use
to
us
there
even
if
they
satisfy
the
spanish
soldiers
we
shall
still
be
arrested
in
the
city
and
put
through
an
examination
and
in
the
meantime
they
will
become
aware
of
the
death
of
the
evangelists
and
our
days
on
this
earth
will
be
numbered
to
this
ulenspiegel
made
answer
the
crows
and
the
owls
and
the
vultures
will
make
short
work
of
their
repast
already
no
doubt
the
dead
bodies
have
become
unrecognizable
as
for
our
passports
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
remain
effective
but
if
the
murder
of
the
evangelists
becomes
known
we
should
be
arrested
as
you
say
nevertheless
whatever
happens
we
shall
have
to
go
to
maestricht
and
pass
through
landen
on
the
way
we
shall
be
captured
said
lamme
we
shall
get
through
answered
ulenspiegel
conversing
in
this
wise
they
came
to
the
inn
of
la
pie
where
they
found
a
good
supper
awaiting
them
and
good
quarters
for
the
night
both
for
themselves
and
for
the
donkeys
and
on
the
morrow
they
took
the
road
again
for
landen
not
far
from
that
town
they
came
to
a
large
farm
there
ulenspiegel
whistled
like
a
lark
and
from
the
interior
came
the
sound
of
a
warlike
cockcrow
in
answer
after
that
a
farmer
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
farmhouse
and
greeted
them
as
friends
and
good
beggarmen
and
bade
them
welcome
who
is
this
man
lamme
inquired
his
name
is
thomas
utenhove
said
ulenspiegel
and
he
is
a
valiant
protestant
the
and
that
work
on
the
farm
are
fellows
with
him
in
the
cause
of
freedom
of
conscience
then
utenhove
said
you
are
the
envoys
of
the
prince
come
in
then
eat
and
drink
with
me
and
the
ham
was
crackling
in
the
the
sausages
likewise
and
the
wine
flowed
and
the
glasses
were
filled
again
and
lamme
drank
like
dry
sand
and
ate
his
fill
and
the
boys
and
girls
of
the
farm
came
one
after
another
and
thrust
their
noses
into
the
door
to
gaze
on
him
as
he
worked
away
so
hard
but
the
men
were
jealous
saying
that
they
also
would
be
able
to
eat
and
drink
as
bravely
if
they
had
the
chance
when
all
was
finished
thomas
utenhove
said
one
hundred
of
our
peasants
will
be
leaving
us
this
week
under
pretext
of
going
to
work
on
the
dikes
at
bruges
and
thereabouts
they
will
be
setting
out
in
small
bands
of
five
or
six
at
a
time
and
all
by
different
routes
at
bruges
they
will
find
certain
barges
waiting
for
them
to
take
them
by
sea
to
emden
will
these
men
be
provided
with
arms
and
with
money
inquired
ulenspiegel
each
man
will
carry
ten
florins
and
a
heavy
cutlass
god
and
the
prince
will
reward
you
said
ulenspiegel
but
tell
me
said
the
farmer
is
edzard
count
of
frise
still
friendly
to
the
prince
he
feigns
not
to
be
answered
ulenspiegel
nevertheless
he
is
giving
harbourage
all
the
time
to
the
prince
ships
at
emden
and
then
he
added
we
are
on
the
way
to
maestricht
you
can
not
go
there
said
the
farmer
the
duke
army
is
camped
in
front
of
the
town
and
all
round
it
with
that
he
conducted
his
visitors
up
into
the
loft
whence
they
could
see
the
standards
of
enemy
cavalry
and
infantry
moving
about
in
the
distance
over
the
plain
ulenspiegel
said
i
have
a
plan
to
get
through
if
only
they
who
have
authority
in
this
place
would
give
me
leave
to
get
married
but
for
wife
i
should
need
a
sweet
and
a
gentle
and
comely
lass
who
would
be
willing
to
marry
me
if
not
for
always
then
for
a
week
at
least
lamme
gasped
with
astonishment
do
do
it
my
son
he
cried
she
will
only
leave
you
and
then
all
alone
you
will
burn
with
the
fire
of
love
and
the
bed
where
now
you
sleep
so
sweetly
will
seem
to
you
nothing
better
than
a
bed
of
prickly
holly
leaves
and
gentle
sleep
will
shun
you
for
evermore
still
i
must
marry
replied
ulenspiegel
and
then
to
thomas
utenhove
come
now
find
me
a
wife
rich
or
poor
i
do
care
which
and
i
will
take
her
to
church
and
our
marriage
shall
be
blessed
by
the
priest
and
he
shall
give
us
our
marriage
lines
though
to
be
sure
we
shall
not
hold
them
valid
as
being
given
by
the
hand
of
a
papist
and
an
inquisitor
nevertheless
they
will
be
good
enough
for
our
purpose
and
we
will
prepare
ourselves
as
is
the
custom
for
our
wedding
trip
but
what
about
the
wife
that
your
answered
ulenspiegel
but
when
you
have
found
her
i
shall
take
two
wagons
and
decorate
them
with
wreaths
of
fir
branches
and
holly
and
paper
flowers
and
in
the
wagons
themselves
i
shall
dispose
the
men
whom
you
wish
to
be
conveyed
to
the
prince
of
orange
but
your
wife
persisted
thomas
utenhove
where
will
you
find
her
here
i
doubt
not
answered
ulenspiegel
and
then
i
shall
harness
two
of
your
own
horses
to
one
of
the
wagons
and
our
two
donkeys
to
the
other
in
the
first
wagon
will
ride
my
wife
and
myself
together
with
my
friend
lamme
here
and
the
witnesses
of
our
nuptials
in
the
second
wagon
will
follow
the
musicians
the
players
upon
the
drum
the
fife
and
the
shawm
and
then
with
all
our
joyous
and
with
music
playing
and
we
ourselves
singing
and
drinking
each
other
healths
we
shall
ride
along
at
the
trot
by
the
high
road
that
leads
to
the
the
field
of
the
gallows
which
for
us
indeed
will
be
the
field
of
liberty
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
help
you
said
thomas
utenhove
but
the
women
and
girls
will
want
to
follow
their
we
will
go
where
god
wills
said
a
girl
who
had
thrust
in
her
head
at
the
door
you
can
have
four
wagons
if
need
be
said
thomas
utenhove
and
by
that
means
we
should
be
able
to
convey
as
many
as
men
the
duke
will
be
nicely
fooled
said
ulenspiegel
and
the
prince
fleet
will
gain
the
service
of
some
fine
soldiers
added
thomas
utenhove
then
he
caused
a
bell
to
be
rung
to
summon
his
footman
and
his
servants
and
when
they
were
all
assembled
he
said
to
them
all
you
that
are
from
the
land
of
zeeland
women
as
well
as
men
listen
now
to
me
ulenspiegel
who
is
hither
come
from
flanders
has
a
plan
to
convey
you
through
the
enemy
lines
disguised
as
the
followers
in
a
wedding
procession
and
thereat
the
men
and
women
of
zeeland
cried
out
with
one
accord
we
are
ready
even
unto
the
death
and
the
men
said
one
to
another
what
joy
it
will
be
to
exchange
this
land
of
slavery
for
the
freedom
of
the
sea
and
the
women
and
girls
said
likewise
let
us
follow
our
husbands
and
our
lovers
we
belong
to
zeeland
and
there
we
shall
find
asile
now
ulenspiegel
had
noticed
a
young
and
pretty
maid
and
he
addressed
her
jokingly
i
would
you
were
my
wife
but
she
blushed
and
answered
him
i
would
have
thee
for
my
husband
but
at
the
church
only
remember
the
women
laughed
and
said
among
themselves
she
is
in
love
with
hans
utenhove
the
master
son
he
will
go
along
with
her
doubtless
you
say
truly
hans
replied
and
his
father
said
you
have
my
permission
then
all
the
men
put
on
their
best
clothes
their
doublets
and
hose
of
velvet
and
the
great
over
all
as
for
the
women
they
wore
black
petticoats
and
pleated
shoes
round
their
necks
they
wore
a
white
ruff
their
bodices
were
embroidered
in
gold
scarlet
and
blue
their
skirts
were
of
black
wool
with
broad
stripes
of
black
velvet
thereon
and
their
stockings
were
of
black
wool
and
their
shoes
of
velvet
with
silver
buckles
thereupon
thomas
utenhove
went
to
the
church
and
put
into
the
hands
of
the
priest
a
couple
of
rycksdaelders
asking
him
at
the
same
time
to
join
in
marriage
thylbert
the
son
of
claes
that
is
ulenspiegel
and
tannekin
pieters
and
this
the
curé
consented
to
do
ulenspiegel
then
went
to
church
followed
by
the
wedding
procession
and
there
in
the
presence
of
the
priest
tannekin
was
made
his
wife
and
she
looked
so
pretty
and
so
sweet
so
complaisant
and
so
tender
that
right
willingly
would
he
have
eaten
her
up
as
she
had
been
a
ripe
apple
of
love
and
he
told
her
so
not
daring
to
do
more
for
the
respect
he
felt
for
her
gentle
loveliness
but
she
pouted
her
lips
and
bade
him
leave
her
alone
for
that
hans
was
watching
him
and
would
kill
him
without
a
doubt
and
a
certain
damsel
was
jealous
and
said
to
ulenspiegel
seek
elsewhere
for
a
lover
do
you
not
see
that
she
is
afraid
of
her
own
man
lamme
clapped
his
hands
together
and
cried
you
can
not
have
them
all
you
rascal
so
ulenspiegel
making
the
best
of
his
misfortune
returned
to
the
farm
with
the
wedding
guests
and
there
he
drank
and
sang
and
made
merry
clinking
many
a
glass
with
the
damsel
that
was
jealous
and
at
this
hans
was
glad
but
not
so
tannekin
nor
yet
the
youth
that
was
betrothed
to
the
damsel
at
noon
while
the
sun
shone
down
from
a
clear
sky
and
a
fresh
breeze
was
blowing
the
wedding
carriages
started
off
they
were
decorated
with
flowers
and
every
kind
of
greenery
with
flags
flying
and
drums
and
fifes
bagpipes
and
shawms
playing
most
joyfully
now
it
happened
that
in
the
camp
of
the
duke
of
alba
there
was
another
fête
in
progress
and
the
sentries
of
the
guard
having
sounded
the
alarm
ran
to
the
duke
crying
the
enemy
is
at
hand
we
have
heard
the
noise
of
drums
and
fifes
and
we
have
seen
their
banners
in
the
distance
there
is
a
strong
force
of
cavalry
that
is
hoping
to
draw
you
into
some
ambush
the
main
body
doubtless
is
not
far
off
the
duke
at
once
sent
to
warn
the
colonels
and
captains
and
himself
ordered
the
army
to
be
massed
in
battle
array
and
dispatched
certain
scouting
parties
on
reconnaissance
then
it
was
that
there
came
on
the
scene
the
four
carriages
making
straight
for
the
duke
gunners
and
in
the
chariots
were
none
but
men
and
women
dancing
and
drinking
and
playing
most
joyously
on
fifes
and
drums
and
bagpipes
and
shawms
and
wondrous
was
the
din
that
came
from
all
those
instruments
when
the
procession
had
been
brought
to
a
halt
the
duke
himself
came
up
attracted
by
the
noise
and
he
saw
the
newly
married
bride
where
she
stood
in
one
of
the
four
chariots
and
beside
her
was
ulenspiegel
the
bridegroom
covered
with
flowers
and
all
the
other
peasants
both
men
and
women
who
had
by
now
got
down
from
the
chariots
and
were
dancing
all
round
them
and
offering
drink
to
the
soldiers
the
duke
and
his
friends
were
much
astonished
at
the
simplicity
of
these
peasants
who
sang
and
made
merry
when
all
around
them
was
an
army
ready
to
do
battle
and
now
they
that
remained
in
the
chariots
were
giving
all
the
wine
to
the
soldiers
and
they
in
their
turn
were
fêted
by
them
and
made
much
of
till
at
last
when
the
wine
began
to
run
out
the
peasants
continued
on
their
way
again
the
drums
and
fifes
and
bagpipes
struck
up
once
more
and
the
cavalcade
moved
off
without
any
let
or
hindrance
and
the
soldiers
in
high
good
humour
let
off
a
volley
from
their
guns
in
honour
of
the
festal
occasion
and
thus
they
came
to
maestricht
where
ulenspiegel
took
counsel
with
the
agents
of
the
reformers
as
to
the
best
way
of
sending
ships
loaded
with
arms
and
munitions
to
the
assistance
of
the
prince
fleet
and
from
there
they
went
to
landen
and
to
other
places
disguised
as
working
men
the
duke
was
not
long
in
learning
the
trick
that
had
been
played
on
him
and
there
came
into
his
hands
a
lampoon
which
was
in
circulation
at
the
time
with
this
refrain
bloody
duke
silly
duke
hast
thou
seen
the
bride
and
every
time
that
the
duke
made
a
mistake
in
his
the
soldiers
would
sing
the
duke
he
ca
see
clearly
he
has
seen
the
bride
xxii
now
in
those
days
the
duke
divided
his
army
into
two
parts
one
of
which
he
ordered
to
march
towards
the
duchy
of
luxemburg
and
the
other
to
the
marquisate
of
namur
these
tactics
of
the
military
are
all
one
to
me
said
ulenspiegel
to
lamme
let
us
go
on
our
way
with
confidence
they
were
walking
along
the
banks
of
the
meuse
near
the
town
of
maestricht
and
lamme
saw
that
ulenspiegel
gazed
attentively
at
all
the
boats
that
were
sailing
on
the
river
suddenly
he
came
to
a
stand
before
one
of
these
boats
upon
whose
prow
was
carved
the
figure
of
a
mermaid
and
the
mermaid
carried
a
shield
and
on
it
in
gold
upon
a
black
ground
were
blazoned
the
letters
being
the
monogram
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
ulenspiegel
signed
to
lamme
that
he
should
stand
still
and
then
he
began
to
sing
like
a
lark
most
joyously
a
man
appeared
on
the
boat
and
began
to
crow
like
a
cock
at
this
ulenspiegel
set
up
a
noise
like
a
donkey
bray
which
the
man
immediately
echoed
with
interest
and
the
two
donkeys
of
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
lay
back
their
ears
and
joined
in
the
chorus
with
their
own
natural
voices
sundry
women
and
men
were
passing
along
that
way
the
latter
riding
on
the
backs
of
the
horses
which
were
tugging
the
barges
along
the
and
ulenspiegel
said
to
lamme
this
boatman
is
making
mock
of
us
and
our
good
steeds
what
do
you
say
to
going
and
attacking
him
on
his
boat
let
us
rather
entice
him
over
to
the
bank
replied
lamme
but
a
woman
who
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
moment
said
if
you
do
want
to
come
back
with
your
arms
cut
off
your
backs
broken
and
your
noses
in
pieces
let
me
advise
you
to
let
this
stercke
pier
bray
at
his
ease
ee
aw
ee
aw
ee
aw
went
the
boatman
let
him
sing
continued
the
woman
only
the
other
day
he
showed
us
how
he
could
lift
on
his
shoulders
a
truck
of
heavy
barrels
of
beer
and
hold
back
yet
another
truck
that
was
being
dragged
forwards
by
a
strong
horse
and
at
the
inn
there
and
as
she
spoke
she
pointed
to
the
tavern
of
the
blauwe
torre
it
was
there
one
day
that
he
threw
his
knife
at
a
plank
of
twelve
inches
thick
and
pierced
it
at
a
distance
of
twenty
paces
ee
aw
ee
aw
ee
aw
went
the
boatman
and
now
he
was
joined
by
a
youngster
of
twelve
or
so
who
climbed
on
to
the
bridge
of
the
boat
and
began
to
bray
in
like
manner
but
ulenspiegel
answered
the
woman
he
nothing
to
us
your
peter
the
strong
for
however
strong
he
is
we
are
stronger
see
my
friend
lamme
here
he
could
eat
up
two
men
like
that
without
so
much
as
a
hiccup
what
this
you
saying
my
son
demanded
lamme
the
truth
answered
ulenspiegel
and
do
not
let
your
modesty
contradict
me
for
of
a
truth
good
people
women
and
working
men
of
maestricht
i
tell
you
that
before
long
you
shall
see
my
friend
here
belabouring
and
beating
to
nothing
this
famous
stercke
pier
of
yours
be
quiet
said
lamme
your
strength
is
famous
far
and
wide
answered
ulenspiegel
you
can
not
conceal
it
ee
aw
went
the
boatman
ee
aw
went
the
boy
suddenly
ulenspiegel
began
again
to
sing
like
a
lark
very
melodiously
and
the
men
and
women
and
workmen
standing
by
were
enchanted
and
began
to
ask
him
where
he
had
learnt
the
art
of
whistling
so
divinely
in
paradise
answered
ulenspiegel
whence
i
come
then
he
addressed
himself
to
the
boatman
who
was
still
continuing
his
braying
and
mocking
why
do
you
stay
there
on
your
boat
you
have
you
the
courage
to
come
and
jeer
at
us
and
our
steeds
from
the
dry
land
have
you
the
courage
for
that
said
lamme
ee
aw
ee
aw
went
the
boatman
come
my
good
come
up
rather
into
my
boat
then
ulenspiegel
whispered
to
lamme
to
do
exactly
as
he
did
but
to
the
boatman
he
said
aloud
if
you
are
stercke
pier
i
am
tyl
ulenspiegel
and
these
two
here
are
our
donkeys
jef
and
jan
and
they
know
how
to
bray
better
than
you
do
for
that
is
their
natural
way
of
talking
as
for
coming
on
to
your
leaky
decks
it
is
the
last
thing
we
wish
to
do
your
boat
is
like
a
tub
and
each
time
that
a
wave
comes
along
it
shivers
and
it
knows
no
other
way
of
walking
save
like
a
crab
yes
like
a
crab
said
lamme
to
which
the
boatman
made
answer
what
are
you
croaking
there
between
your
teeth
great
block
of
fat
at
this
lamme
fell
into
a
rage
crying
you
are
no
christian
to
make
mock
of
my
infirmity
my
fat
is
my
own
let
me
tell
you
and
is
the
result
of
the
good
food
i
eat
whereas
you
old
bag
of
bones
that
you
are
you
have
never
lived
upon
aught
better
than
smoked
herrings
and
old
if
one
may
judge
anything
from
the
lean
flesh
that
shows
through
the
tears
in
your
measly
hose
ee
aw
ee
aw
cried
the
boatman
and
lamme
would
have
got
down
from
his
donkey
to
collect
stones
to
throw
at
him
had
not
ulenspiegel
said
him
nay
the
boatman
now
began
to
whisper
something
into
the
ear
of
the
lad
who
was
still
ee
awing
at
his
side
and
a
moment
later
the
lad
unfastened
a
little
boat
which
lay
by
the
side
of
the
big
one
and
with
the
end
of
the
shoved
himself
cleverly
off
towards
the
when
the
boy
was
quite
close
to
the
bank
he
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
threw
down
this
challenge
my
master
wants
to
know
if
you
will
have
the
courage
to
come
on
to
his
boat
and
join
with
him
in
a
battle
of
fist
and
feet
and
these
good
men
and
women
shall
be
the
arbiters
certainly
said
ulenspiegel
in
a
dignified
tone
of
voice
we
accept
the
challenge
said
lamme
haughtily
it
was
midday
the
workmen
who
laboured
on
the
dike
and
the
and
the
builders
of
ships
were
about
to
take
their
repast
of
beans
and
boiled
beef
which
had
been
brought
them
by
their
or
their
children
all
these
then
who
stood
around
began
to
laugh
and
to
clap
their
hands
at
the
prospect
of
a
fight
looking
forward
with
joy
to
the
chance
of
seeing
the
head
of
one
of
the
combatants
broken
or
his
body
thrown
in
pieces
into
the
river
my
son
said
lamme
under
his
breath
the
boatman
will
assuredly
throw
us
into
the
water
let
him
throw
you
in
if
he
wants
to
said
ulenspiegel
the
big
one
is
afraid
said
the
crowd
of
workmen
lamme
who
was
still
sitting
his
donkey
turned
round
and
gave
them
a
look
of
anger
but
they
jeered
at
him
the
more
come
on
said
lamme
let
us
to
the
boat
and
then
they
shall
see
if
i
am
afraid
at
these
words
the
jeers
broke
out
again
and
ulenspiegel
said
come
let
us
to
the
boat
when
therefore
they
had
dismounted
from
their
donkeys
they
threw
the
bridles
to
the
boatman
lad
who
caressed
the
animals
in
friendly
wise
and
led
them
to
a
place
where
he
saw
some
thistles
growing
at
the
same
time
ulenspiegel
seized
hold
of
the
made
lamme
get
into
the
skiff
and
then
steered
straight
for
the
big
boat
there
he
mounted
on
to
the
deck
by
the
help
of
a
rope
and
lamme
climbed
up
in
front
of
him
puffing
and
blowing
arrived
on
the
bridge
of
the
boat
ulenspiegel
leant
down
as
if
to
lace
up
his
boots
and
at
the
same
time
he
spoke
a
word
into
the
boatman
ear
who
straightway
laughed
and
gave
lamme
a
curious
look
then
he
began
to
roar
out
at
him
every
kind
of
insult
calling
him
worthless
rogue
a
man
bloated
with
vicious
fat
and
at
the
same
time
inquiring
of
him
how
many
tons
of
oil
they
gave
him
when
he
was
bled
all
of
a
sudden
without
waiting
to
reply
lamme
threw
himself
like
a
mad
bull
upon
the
boatman
knocked
him
down
and
began
to
beat
him
with
all
his
might
the
boatman
however
did
not
receive
much
injury
forasmuch
as
lamme
arms
were
but
weak
on
account
of
their
fatness
and
the
boatman
suffered
himself
to
be
thus
dealt
with
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
making
a
great
pretence
at
resistance
all
the
time
and
the
men
and
women
who
were
watching
the
battle
from
the
bank
were
astonished
and
exclaimed
to
each
other
who
would
have
thought
that
this
fat
man
could
be
so
fiery
and
they
clapped
their
hands
while
lamme
continued
to
belabour
the
boatman
most
unmercifully
but
the
latter
took
care
only
to
protect
his
face
suddenly
lamme
was
seen
to
be
kneeling
upon
the
breast
of
stercke
pier
with
one
hand
on
his
adversary
throat
and
the
other
raised
to
strike
cry
for
mercy
he
said
furiously
or
else
i
shall
make
you
pass
through
the
planks
of
your
tub
at
this
the
boatman
began
to
cough
thereby
signifying
that
he
could
not
speak
and
demanded
mercy
with
a
sign
of
his
hand
then
lamme
was
seen
to
pick
up
his
adversary
in
a
most
generous
manner
who
thereupon
standing
upright
and
turning
his
back
towards
the
onlookers
put
out
his
tongue
at
ulenspiegel
now
the
latter
was
rocking
with
laughter
to
see
lamme
shaking
the
feather
on
his
cap
so
proudly
and
walking
about
in
triumph
upon
the
deck
of
the
boat
and
the
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
who
were
watching
from
the
bank
applauded
their
loudest
and
cried
out
long
live
the
conqueror
of
stercke
pier
he
is
a
man
of
iron
did
you
see
how
he
cuffed
him
with
his
fist
and
how
he
threw
him
down
on
his
back
with
a
blow
of
his
hand
but
see
they
are
now
about
to
drink
together
to
make
the
peace
stercke
pier
is
coming
up
from
the
hold
with
wine
and
sausages
and
in
very
truth
stercke
pier
might
now
have
been
seen
coming
on
deck
with
two
tankards
and
a
quart
of
white
meuse
wine
and
lamme
and
the
boatman
made
their
peace
after
which
lamme
asked
his
new
friend
what
sort
of
fricassees
they
were
that
were
being
cooked
in
the
hold
of
the
ship
for
at
one
end
of
the
deck
was
a
chimney
whence
rose
a
column
of
thick
black
smoke
and
the
boatman
made
answer
since
you
are
men
of
valiant
heart
knowing
well
the
song
of
the
lark
the
bird
of
freedom
and
the
warlike
clarion
of
the
cock
and
the
bray
of
the
ass
withal
come
you
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
my
kitchen
and
so
saying
he
led
the
way
into
the
hold
where
removing
certain
planks
from
the
floor
he
disclosed
some
mighty
piles
of
together
with
a
quantity
of
iron
lances
halberds
and
a
great
heap
of
powder
and
shot
where
shall
i
take
them
he
asked
to
emden
through
the
north
sea
said
ulenspiegel
good
beggarman
that
you
are
the
sea
is
big
said
the
boatman
big
for
battle
said
ulenspiegel
god
is
with
us
said
the
boatman
who
then
can
be
against
us
cried
ulenspiegel
and
when
they
had
thus
spoken
the
boatman
conducted
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
on
deck
with
many
words
of
cheer
and
good
counsel
then
they
rowed
to
the
bank
where
they
mounted
again
upon
their
donkeys
and
set
off
towards
liége
my
son
said
lamme
whilst
they
were
ambling
gently
along
pray
tell
me
why
did
that
man
strong
as
he
was
allow
himself
to
be
beaten
by
me
so
cruelly
to
the
end
answered
ulenspiegel
that
wherever
we
go
the
fear
of
your
prowess
may
go
before
us
that
indeed
will
prove
a
more
powerful
escort
than
twenty
landsknechts
for
who
would
dare
to
measure
his
strength
with
lamme
the
mighty
lamme
the
conqueror
lamme
the
matchless
bull
among
men
that
overcame
in
the
sight
of
all
beholders
the
famous
stercke
pier
peter
the
strong
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
like
a
feather
you
say
well
my
son
said
lamme
drawing
himself
up
in
the
saddle
and
i
say
what
is
true
answered
ulenspiegel
for
did
you
not
notice
the
faces
that
looked
out
so
curiously
from
the
houses
on
the
outskirts
of
this
village
they
were
pointing
at
the
terrible
figure
of
lamme
the
conqueror
and
do
you
see
these
men
who
are
gazing
on
you
even
now
with
such
envy
and
these
sorry
cowards
who
uncover
as
you
pass
answer
to
their
salute
o
lamme
my
sweet
one
nor
be
disdainful
of
the
populace
behold
the
very
children
know
your
name
and
whisper
it
with
terror
and
lamme
passed
along
proudly
saluting
right
and
left
like
a
king
and
the
fame
of
his
valour
followed
him
from
village
to
village
and
from
town
to
town
as
far
as
liége
chocquier
la
neuville
vesin
and
namur
to
which
place
however
our
travellers
gave
a
wide
berth
because
of
the
three
evangelists
and
so
they
wended
along
by
the
banks
of
river
and
canal
and
everywhere
the
song
of
the
lark
answered
the
song
of
the
cock
and
wherever
they
went
they
found
that
in
the
sacred
cause
of
liberty
weapons
were
being
forged
and
armour
furbished
for
the
ships
that
stood
by
along
the
coast
to
carry
away
and
lamme
preceded
everywhere
by
his
glorious
reputation
began
himself
to
believe
in
his
own
prowess
and
growing
proud
and
warlike
he
let
his
beard
grow
too
and
ulenspiegel
called
him
lamme
the
lion
but
lamme
did
not
continue
in
this
purpose
longer
than
the
fourth
day
because
the
hairs
of
his
beard
began
to
tickle
him
and
he
passed
a
razor
over
the
surface
of
his
victorious
countenance
so
that
it
appeared
thereafter
like
his
own
face
once
more
round
and
full
as
the
sun
ablaze
with
the
flame
of
good
nourishment
and
thus
they
came
at
length
to
harlebeke
xxiii
at
harlebeke
lamme
renewed
his
provision
of
oliekoekjes
eating
of
them
on
the
spot
and
putting
thirty
away
into
his
basket
the
same
evening
they
came
to
courtrai
and
dismounted
from
their
donkeys
at
the
tavern
of
the
bee
that
was
kept
by
one
gilis
van
den
ende
who
himself
came
to
the
inn
door
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
singing
of
the
lark
at
once
the
new
arrivals
found
that
everything
was
made
like
sugar
and
honey
for
them
for
mine
host
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
the
letter
from
the
prince
presented
ulenspiegel
with
fifty
caroluses
on
the
behalf
nor
would
he
accept
any
payment
at
all
for
the
turkey
which
he
served
for
their
dinner
nor
yet
for
the
dobbel
clauwaert
which
he
gave
them
to
drink
he
warned
them
also
that
there
were
many
spies
in
courtrai
and
that
it
behoved
both
ulenspiegel
and
his
companion
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
what
they
said
during
their
stay
in
the
city
we
shall
be
careful
said
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
and
so
saying
they
came
out
of
the
tavern
the
gables
of
the
houses
were
all
gilded
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
the
birds
sang
in
the
and
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
wandered
at
their
ease
along
the
streets
of
the
town
all
at
once
lamme
said
i
asked
martin
van
den
ende
if
by
chance
he
had
seen
any
one
at
all
resembling
my
wife
in
courtrai
and
he
told
me
that
there
were
a
number
of
women
that
were
accustomed
to
meet
together
of
an
evening
at
the
sign
of
the
rainbow
a
house
that
is
kept
by
a
woman
called
la
stevenyne
just
outside
the
town
on
the
road
to
bruges
i
shall
go
there
i
will
meet
you
anon
said
ulenspiegel
but
now
i
would
see
the
sights
of
the
town
if
i
meet
your
wife
i
will
send
her
on
to
you
meanwhile
remember
what
the
innkeeper
said
and
keep
your
own
counsel
if
you
value
your
own
skin
i
will
be
careful
said
lamme
ulenspiegel
walked
about
by
himself
till
the
sun
set
and
night
began
to
come
on
quickly
he
had
come
to
the
the
alley
of
the
pot
of
stone
and
there
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
viola
being
played
most
melodiously
and
presently
he
noticed
a
white
figure
that
beckoned
to
him
from
a
distance
then
retreated
playing
the
viola
all
the
time
it
was
a
woman
and
she
sang
like
a
seraphim
a
sweet
slow
song
stopping
now
and
then
to
look
behind
her
with
a
beckoning
gesture
then
retreating
again
but
ulenspiegel
ran
quickly
and
overtook
her
and
was
about
to
speak
to
her
when
she
sealed
his
lips
with
a
hand
all
scented
with
benjamin
are
you
a
working
man
or
a
nobleman
she
asked
i
am
ulenspiegel
are
you
rich
rich
enough
for
you
but
you
have
not
seen
me
and
she
opened
the
lantern
she
carried
so
as
to
let
the
light
shine
straight
upon
her
face
you
are
beautiful
said
ulenspiegel
then
come
with
me
she
said
and
she
brought
him
to
the
house
of
la
stevenyne
on
the
road
to
bruges
at
the
sign
of
the
rainbow
they
entered
a
large
room
where
a
great
number
of
girls
were
assembled
who
all
looked
up
jealously
at
ulenspiegel
companion
as
she
came
in
and
suddenly
ulenspiegel
saw
lamme
sitting
there
in
a
corner
by
a
little
table
whereon
was
a
candle
a
ham
and
a
pot
of
beer
by
his
side
were
a
couple
of
girls
who
were
endeavouring
to
get
a
share
in
the
ham
and
the
beer
but
lamme
was
trying
to
prevent
them
as
soon
as
he
noticed
ulenspiegel
he
jumped
up
crying
blessed
be
god
who
has
given
back
to
me
my
friend
bring
more
drink
baesine
at
this
ulenspiegel
drew
out
his
purse
saying
yes
bring
us
to
drink
to
the
value
of
what
is
in
here
and
he
jingled
the
money
that
was
in
the
purse
no
by
heaven
cried
lamme
seizing
the
purse
it
i
that
shall
pay
not
you
ulenspiegel
would
have
recovered
the
purse
by
force
but
lamme
kept
tight
hold
as
they
were
struggling
together
the
one
to
keep
the
purse
the
other
to
get
it
back
again
lamme
whispered
by
fits
and
starts
into
ulenspiegel
ear
listen
constables
here
four
of
them
in
the
little
room
with
three
girls
two
outside
waiting
for
you
and
for
me
i
tried
to
go
out
prevented
the
girl
over
there
in
the
brocaded
gown
is
a
spy
stevenyne
a
spy
and
all
the
time
they
were
fighting
ulenspiegel
listened
attentively
though
he
kept
on
crying
aloud
give
me
back
my
purse
you
rascal
and
they
seized
each
other
by
the
neck
and
by
the
shoulders
and
rolled
together
on
the
floor
while
lamme
went
on
with
his
tidings
to
ulenspiegel
suddenly
there
appeared
on
the
scene
mine
host
of
the
tavern
of
the
bee
and
he
was
followed
by
seven
other
men
with
whom
however
he
apparently
had
no
connexion
as
he
came
in
he
crowed
like
a
cock
and
ulenspiegel
whistled
like
a
lark
then
seeing
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
still
struggling
on
the
floor
he
inquired
of
la
stevenyne
who
they
might
be
two
rascals
she
told
him
who
ought
to
be
parted
from
each
other
instead
of
being
allowed
to
make
all
this
disturbance
ere
they
are
brought
to
the
gallows
if
any
one
tries
to
separate
us
said
ulenspiegel
we
will
make
him
eat
of
these
yes
said
lamme
we
will
make
him
eat
these
then
ulenspiegel
whispered
something
in
lamme
ear
the
innkeeper
is
come
to
rescue
us
and
presently
the
innkeeper
who
must
have
divined
some
mystery
was
afoot
joined
the
mêlée
on
the
floor
with
his
head
down
and
lamme
attacked
him
in
the
ear
with
these
words
you
have
come
to
rescue
us
how
will
you
do
it
the
innkeeper
made
pretence
of
pulling
ulenspiegel
by
the
ears
but
managed
to
say
to
him
the
while
under
his
breath
these
seven
men
are
on
your
side
they
are
strong
men
butchers
i
must
be
off
too
well
known
in
the
town
but
when
i
have
gone
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
break
up
everything
i
understand
said
ulenspiegel
rising
at
the
same
time
from
the
floor
and
kicking
out
at
the
innkeeper
the
latter
struck
ulenspiegel
in
his
turn
and
ulenspiegel
said
you
hit
hard
my
hearty
as
hard
as
a
said
the
innkeeper
and
quickly
seizing
the
purse
from
lamme
he
handed
it
back
to
ulenspiegel
you
may
stand
me
a
drink
you
rogue
now
you
are
come
into
your
right
mind
again
i
stand
you
one
you
scandalous
scamp
replied
ulenspiegel
see
how
insolent
he
is
said
la
stevenyne
as
insolent
as
you
are
beautiful
answered
ulenspiegel
now
la
stevenyne
was
sixty
years
old
at
least
and
her
face
was
like
the
fruit
of
the
medlar
but
all
yellow
with
bile
and
she
had
a
large
stain
on
her
left
cheek
when
the
innkeeper
had
had
his
drink
he
paid
the
bill
and
departed
the
seven
butchers
meanwhile
made
sundry
knowing
grimaces
at
the
constables
and
la
stevenyne
one
of
them
indicated
by
a
gesture
that
he
held
ulenspiegel
for
a
simpleton
and
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
for
him
very
easily
but
all
the
time
that
he
was
putting
out
his
tongue
in
mockery
to
la
stevenyne
who
herself
was
grinning
and
laughing
he
whispered
in
ulenspiegel
ear
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
it
is
time
to
rattle
the
glasses
then
in
his
ordinary
tone
of
voice
and
pointing
at
the
constables
gentle
reformer
he
said
we
are
all
on
your
side
stand
us
some
food
and
drink
wo
you
and
la
stevenyne
laughed
with
pleasure
and
put
out
her
tongue
at
ulenspiegel
when
his
back
was
turned
and
la
gilline
she
of
the
brocaded
gown
she
also
put
out
her
tongue
at
ulenspiegel
and
the
girls
all
began
to
whisper
one
to
another
behold
the
spy
that
by
her
beauty
draweth
men
to
the
torture
and
bringeth
them
at
last
to
a
death
more
cruel
even
than
torture
above
protestants
hath
she
betrayed
already
gilline
is
her
name
and
now
she
is
in
a
rapture
of
joy
as
she
thinks
of
the
reward
she
will
get
for
her
information
the
first
hundred
caroluses
to
wit
from
the
estate
of
each
of
her
victims
but
she
will
not
laugh
when
she
bethinketh
her
that
she
must
share
of
the
spoil
with
la
stevenyne
and
every
one
there
present
the
constables
the
butchers
and
the
girls
themselves
put
out
their
tongues
in
mockery
of
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
sweated
great
drops
of
sweat
and
became
red
with
anger
like
the
crest
of
a
cock
but
he
would
not
let
himself
say
a
word
come
stand
us
food
and
drink
said
the
butchers
and
the
constables
very
well
said
ulenspiegel
jingling
yet
again
the
money
in
his
purse
bring
us
meat
and
drink
my
sweet
stevenyne
bring
us
drink
in
glasses
that
can
sing
at
this
the
girls
began
to
laugh
anew
but
la
stevenyne
went
down
to
the
cellar
and
brought
back
with
her
ham
sausages
omelettes
and
some
of
those
singing
glasses
that
are
so
called
because
they
are
mounted
on
tall
stems
and
can
be
made
to
resound
like
a
bell
when
some
one
strikes
them
then
ulenspiegel
said
let
him
who
is
hungry
eat
and
he
who
is
thirsty
let
him
drink
and
the
constables
the
girls
the
butchers
gilline
and
la
stevenyne
applauded
these
words
of
ulenspiegel
clapping
their
hands
and
stamping
their
feet
and
then
they
all
sat
down
to
the
feast
ulenspiegel
lamme
and
the
seven
butchers
sat
at
the
big
table
of
honour
the
constables
and
the
girls
at
two
smaller
tables
and
they
ate
and
drank
right
heartily
and
the
constables
invited
their
two
comrades
who
had
been
waiting
outside
the
house
to
come
in
and
join
them
la
stevenyne
said
with
a
snigger
remember
no
one
can
leave
till
he
has
paid
me
and
she
went
and
locked
all
the
doors
and
put
the
keys
in
her
pocket
at
this
la
gilline
raised
her
glass
the
bird
is
in
its
cage
she
cried
let
us
drink
but
two
of
the
girls
whose
names
were
gena
and
margot
said
to
her
is
this
yet
another
man
that
you
are
going
to
lure
to
his
death
you
wicked
one
i
know
not
said
gilline
let
us
drink
but
the
girls
would
not
drink
with
her
and
gilline
took
her
viola
and
sang
in
french
this
song
au
son
de
la
viole
je
chante
nuit
et
jour
je
suis
la
la
vendeuse
astarté
de
mes
hanches
fit
les
lignes
de
feu
les
épaules
blanches
et
mon
beau
corps
est
dieu
je
suis
froide
ou
brûlante
tendre
au
doux
nonchaloir
tiède
éperdue
ardente
mon
homme
à
ton
vouloir
vois
je
vends
tout
mes
charmes
mon
âme
et
mes
yeux
bleus
bonheur
rires
et
larmes
et
la
mort
si
tu
veux
au
son
de
la
viole
je
chante
nuit
et
jour
je
suis
la
la
vendeuse
as
she
sang
this
song
la
gilline
looked
so
beautiful
so
soft
and
fragrant
that
all
the
men
the
constables
and
the
butchers
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
himself
sat
smiling
there
quite
melted
and
overcome
by
her
charm
all
at
once
la
gilline
gave
a
loud
laugh
and
fixed
her
gaze
on
ulenspiegel
and
it
thus
that
the
birds
are
caged
she
said
and
the
spell
of
her
charm
was
broken
ulenspiegel
lamme
and
the
butchers
looked
at
one
another
well
now
said
la
stevenyne
are
you
going
to
pay
the
bill
my
lord
ulenspiegel
we
shall
pay
nothing
in
advance
said
he
then
i
shall
pay
myself
later
on
out
of
your
inheritance
said
la
stevenyne
after
that
let
us
drink
she
cried
let
us
drink
cried
the
constables
let
us
drink
cried
la
stevenyne
the
doors
are
shut
the
windows
are
strongly
barred
the
birds
are
in
their
cage
let
us
drink
let
us
drink
then
said
ulenspiegel
and
bring
us
wine
of
the
best
to
crown
the
banquet
la
stevenyne
brought
in
more
wine
and
now
they
were
all
seated
drinking
and
eating
the
constables
and
the
girls
together
but
the
seven
butchers
were
at
the
same
table
with
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
and
they
kept
on
throwing
pieces
of
ham
and
sausages
omelettes
and
bottles
of
wine
to
the
table
of
the
girls
who
themselves
caught
the
food
in
as
carp
catch
the
flies
that
buzz
on
the
surface
of
a
fishpond
and
la
stevenyne
laughed
and
grinned
and
pointed
to
the
packets
of
candles
which
hung
over
the
counter
and
these
were
the
candles
that
the
gay
girls
were
used
to
purchase
five
to
the
pound
then
la
stevenyne
said
to
ulenspiegel
on
his
way
to
the
stake
it
is
the
custom
for
the
condemned
man
to
carry
a
wax
candle
shall
i
make
you
a
present
of
one
let
us
drink
said
ulenspiegel
but
la
gilline
said
look
at
ulenspiegel
eyes
they
are
shining
like
the
eyes
of
a
swan
that
is
about
to
die
would
you
like
to
eat
one
of
the
candles
said
la
stevenyne
they
would
serve
you
in
hell
to
lighten
your
eternal
damnation
i
see
clearly
enough
to
admire
your
ugly
mug
said
ulenspiegel
suddenly
he
struck
the
stem
of
his
and
clapped
his
hands
together
with
a
rhythm
like
that
an
upholsterer
uses
when
he
beats
the
wool
of
a
mattress
with
his
stick
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
he
said
it
is
time
to
make
the
glasses
shiver
the
glasses
which
resound
and
this
in
flanders
is
the
signal
that
the
drinkers
make
when
they
are
angry
and
when
they
are
like
to
ransack
and
despoil
in
their
wrath
the
houses
of
ill
fame
so
even
now
did
ulenspiegel
raise
his
glass
and
drink
and
then
did
he
made
it
vibrate
upon
the
table
crying
yet
again
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
and
the
seven
butchers
did
likewise
then
a
great
stillness
fell
upon
the
company
la
gilline
grew
pale
la
stevenyne
looked
astonished
the
constables
said
are
the
seven
with
them
too
but
the
butchers
winked
their
eyes
and
reassured
them
yet
all
the
time
they
continued
without
ceasing
and
louder
and
louder
as
ulenspiegel
led
them
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
la
stevenyne
took
another
draught
of
wine
to
give
herself
courage
then
ulenspiegel
struck
his
fist
on
the
table
in
that
regular
rhythm
which
the
upholsterers
use
as
they
beat
their
mattresses
and
the
seven
did
likewise
and
the
glasses
jugs
trenchers
flagons
and
goblets
began
to
dance
upon
the
table
slowly
at
first
but
beginning
soon
to
knock
against
each
other
and
to
break
and
to
heel
over
on
one
side
as
they
fell
and
all
the
time
echoed
and
more
sternly
menacing
with
every
monotonous
repetition
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
alas
said
la
stevenyne
they
will
break
everything
and
her
teeth
seemed
to
show
farther
out
from
her
lips
than
ever
and
the
hot
blood
of
their
fury
and
of
their
anger
began
to
flame
in
the
souls
of
the
seven
butchers
and
in
the
souls
of
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
till
at
last
without
ceasing
once
their
melancholy
and
monotonous
chant
all
they
that
were
sitting
at
ulenspiegel
table
took
their
glasses
and
brake
them
upon
the
table
and
at
the
same
moment
they
drew
their
cutlasses
and
leapt
upon
the
chairs
and
they
made
such
a
din
with
their
song
that
all
the
windows
in
the
house
shook
then
like
a
band
of
infuriated
devils
they
went
round
the
room
visiting
each
table
in
turn
crying
without
ceasing
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
and
the
constables
rose
up
trembling
with
terror
and
seized
their
ropes
and
chains
but
the
butchers
together
with
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
thrust
their
knives
quickly
back
into
their
cases
and
sprang
up
to
run
nimbly
through
the
chamber
hitting
out
right
and
left
with
their
chairs
as
though
they
had
been
cudgels
and
they
spared
nothing
there
except
the
girls
for
everything
else
they
brake
in
pieces
furniture
windows
chests
plates
pots
trenchers
glasses
and
flagons
hitting
out
at
the
constables
without
mercy
and
crying
out
all
the
time
in
the
rhythm
of
the
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
and
ulenspiegel
who
had
given
la
stevenyne
a
blow
on
the
nose
with
his
fist
and
had
taken
all
her
keys
and
put
them
into
his
satchel
was
now
amusing
himself
by
forcing
her
to
eat
those
candles
of
hers
and
the
girls
laughed
at
the
sight
of
her
as
she
sneezed
with
anger
and
tried
to
spit
out
the
candles
but
in
vain
for
her
mouth
was
too
full
and
all
the
time
ulenspiegel
and
the
seven
butchers
did
not
cease
the
rhythm
of
their
dire
refrain
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
but
at
last
ulenspiegel
made
a
sign
and
when
silence
had
at
last
been
restored
he
spake
saying
you
are
here
my
friends
in
our
power
it
is
a
dark
night
and
the
river
lys
is
close
at
hand
where
a
man
drowns
easily
if
he
is
once
pushed
in
and
the
gates
of
courtrai
are
shut
then
turning
to
the
seven
butchers
you
are
bound
for
peteghen
to
join
the
beggarmen
we
were
ready
to
go
there
when
the
news
came
to
us
that
you
were
here
and
from
peteghen
you
were
going
to
the
sea
yes
they
said
do
you
think
there
are
one
or
two
among
these
constables
whom
it
would
be
safe
to
release
for
our
service
there
are
two
they
said
niklaes
and
joos
by
name
who
have
never
as
yet
been
guilty
of
persecuting
the
poor
reformers
you
can
trust
us
said
niklaes
and
joos
very
well
then
said
ulenspiegel
here
are
twenty
caroluses
for
you
twice
as
much
that
is
as
you
would
have
got
for
an
act
of
shameful
betrayal
and
at
that
the
other
five
constables
cried
out
as
one
man
twenty
florins
we
will
serve
the
prince
for
twenty
florins
the
king
pay
is
bad
only
give
us
half
as
much
and
we
will
tell
the
judge
any
tale
you
please
but
lamme
and
the
butchers
kept
muttering
under
their
breath
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
in
order
that
you
may
be
kept
from
too
much
talking
ulenspiegel
continued
the
seven
will
lead
you
in
handcuffs
to
peteghen
and
there
you
will
be
given
over
into
the
hands
of
the
beggarmen
the
florins
will
be
handed
to
you
at
sea
and
if
you
prove
brave
in
battle
you
will
have
your
share
of
the
spoil
if
you
attempt
to
desert
you
will
be
hanged
we
will
serve
him
who
pays
us
they
said
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
murmured
the
seven
you
will
also
take
with
you
said
ulenspiegel
la
gilline
la
stevenyne
and
the
girls
if
any
one
of
them
tries
to
escape
you
will
sew
her
in
a
sack
and
throw
her
into
the
river
he
has
not
killed
me
yet
cried
la
gilline
jumping
up
from
her
corner
and
brandishing
her
viola
in
the
air
and
she
began
to
sing
sanglant
était
mon
rêve
le
rêve
de
mon
coeur
je
suis
la
fille
et
de
satan
vainqueur
but
la
stevenyne
and
the
others
seemed
as
if
they
were
going
to
cry
do
not
be
afraid
my
sweets
said
ulenspiegel
you
are
so
pretty
and
so
tender
that
all
men
will
love
to
caress
you
wherever
you
go
and
after
every
victory
you
will
have
your
share
in
the
spoils
but
the
three
girls
turned
upon
la
gilline
you
that
were
her
daughter
her
breadwinner
sharing
with
la
stevenyne
the
shameful
rewards
of
her
espionage
do
you
still
dare
to
flaunt
yourself
before
us
and
to
insult
us
with
your
dress
of
brocade
verily
it
is
the
blood
of
the
victims
and
nothing
else
that
has
clothed
you
so
richly
but
now
let
us
take
her
dress
from
her
so
she
may
be
like
to
us
that
shall
not
be
said
ulenspiegel
and
the
girls
looked
jealously
at
ulenspiegel
saying
he
is
mad
about
her
like
all
the
rest
and
la
gilline
played
upon
her
viola
and
sang
and
the
seven
butchers
departed
for
peteghen
taking
with
them
the
constables
and
the
girls
and
they
passed
along
by
the
river
lys
and
as
they
went
they
kept
muttering
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
is
van
te
beven
de
klinkaert
and
at
break
of
day
they
came
to
the
camp
and
sang
out
like
the
lark
and
were
answered
straightway
by
a
cockcrow
the
girls
and
the
constables
were
put
under
a
strong
guard
but
in
spite
of
these
precautions
la
gilline
was
found
dead
at
noon
on
the
third
day
her
heart
pierced
by
a
long
needle
the
three
girls
accused
la
stevenyne
of
having
done
this
deed
and
she
was
brought
before
the
captain
there
she
confessed
that
she
had
committed
the
crime
out
of
jealousy
and
anger
at
the
way
the
girl
had
treated
her
and
la
stevenyne
was
hanged
and
buried
in
the
wood
la
gilline
also
was
buried
and
prayers
were
said
over
her
sweet
body
xxiv
warm
was
the
air
and
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
wafted
from
the
calm
sea
the
trees
on
the
damme
canal
were
motionless
and
the
grasshoppers
were
busy
in
the
meadows
while
from
many
a
church
and
abbey
the
men
came
into
the
fields
to
fetch
that
thirteenth
part
of
the
harvest
which
was
claimed
by
the
curés
and
the
abbés
who
lived
round
about
from
the
depths
of
a
blue
and
blazing
sky
the
sun
poured
down
his
heat
and
nature
slept
beneath
that
radiance
like
some
beautiful
girl
that
has
swooned
away
beneath
the
caresses
of
her
lover
from
far
off
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
descried
the
high
square
massive
tower
of
notre
dame
and
lamme
said
there
my
son
is
the
home
both
of
your
loves
and
of
your
sorrows
but
ulenspiegel
made
no
answer
in
a
little
while
continued
lamme
i
shall
be
seeing
my
old
home
and
perhaps
my
wife
but
ulenspiegel
did
not
answer
you
man
of
wood
said
lamme
you
heart
of
stone
will
nothing
move
you
neither
the
near
approach
to
the
place
where
you
passed
your
childhood
nor
yet
the
dear
memory
of
poor
claes
and
soetkin
the
two
martyrs
what
you
are
not
sad
neither
are
you
merry
who
can
it
be
that
has
thus
hardened
your
heart
look
at
me
how
anxious
and
uneasy
i
am
and
how
my
belly
heaves
with
nervousness
look
at
me
i
say
but
lamme
looked
at
ulenspiegel
and
saw
that
his
face
was
drawn
and
pale
and
his
lips
were
trembling
with
tears
and
he
said
not
a
word
and
now
lamme
also
held
his
peace
they
walked
along
in
this
way
without
speaking
till
they
came
to
damme
which
they
entered
by
the
rue
héron
and
they
saw
no
one
about
because
of
the
heat
only
the
dogs
lay
on
their
sides
on
the
doorsteps
of
many
a
house
gasping
with
their
tongues
out
while
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
passed
right
in
front
of
the
town
hall
where
claes
had
been
burnt
to
death
and
here
the
lips
of
ulenspiegel
trembled
the
more
and
his
tears
dried
up
and
at
last
they
were
come
to
the
house
of
claes
himself
which
was
now
occupied
by
a
master
ulenspiegel
entered
in
and
said
do
you
recognize
me
i
would
wish
to
rest
here
a
while
the
master
answered
i
recognize
you
you
are
the
son
of
the
victim
you
are
free
in
this
house
to
go
wheresoever
you
will
ulenspiegel
went
into
the
kitchen
and
then
upstairs
into
the
room
of
claes
and
soetkin
and
there
he
shed
many
tears
when
he
had
come
down
again
the
master
said
to
him
here
is
bread
cheese
and
beer
if
you
are
hungry
eat
if
you
are
thirsty
drink
but
ulenspiegel
made
a
gesture
to
the
effect
that
he
was
neither
hungry
nor
thirsty
and
he
left
the
house
and
came
with
lamme
to
katheline
cottage
and
there
they
tethered
their
donkeys
and
straightway
entered
in
it
was
the
hour
of
the
midday
meal
on
the
table
was
a
dish
of
broad
beans
in
their
pods
together
with
some
white
beans
katheline
was
busy
eating
while
nele
was
standing
by
her
ready
to
pour
into
katheline
plate
some
vinegar
sauce
which
she
had
just
taken
off
the
fire
when
ulenspiegel
came
into
the
room
nele
was
so
startled
that
she
put
the
sauce
and
the
pot
and
all
into
katheline
platter
and
katheline
kept
on
wagging
her
head
and
picking
out
the
broad
beans
with
her
spoon
from
the
trencher
striking
her
forehead
the
while
and
crying
ever
like
one
mad
put
out
the
fire
my
head
is
burning
and
the
smell
of
the
vinegar
made
lamme
feel
hungry
but
ulenspiegel
stood
still
where
he
was
gazing
at
nele
and
smiling
for
love
of
her
despite
his
great
sorrow
and
nele
without
a
word
of
greeting
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
she
also
seemed
like
one
bereft
of
sense
for
she
cried
and
laughed
and
blushing
as
she
was
with
her
great
and
sweet
happiness
she
could
only
say
tyl
tyl
ulenspiegel
happy
now
in
his
turn
gazed
into
her
eyes
then
she
let
go
of
him
and
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
gazed
at
him
joyfully
in
her
turn
and
then
threw
herself
on
him
again
clasping
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
so
many
times
and
again
and
he
suffered
her
gladly
powerless
to
tear
himself
away
from
her
till
at
last
she
fell
into
a
chair
tired
out
and
like
one
bereft
of
her
senses
and
she
said
without
shame
tyl
tyl
my
beloved
here
you
are
come
back
to
me
again
lamme
meanwhile
was
standing
at
the
door
but
when
nele
had
recovered
herself
a
little
she
pointed
to
him
saying
where
have
i
seen
this
fat
man
he
is
my
friend
ulenspiegel
told
her
he
goes
seeking
his
wife
in
my
company
i
know
you
said
nele
to
lamme
you
used
to
live
in
the
rue
héron
you
are
seeking
for
your
wife
well
i
have
seen
her
she
is
living
at
bruges
in
all
piety
and
devotion
and
when
i
asked
her
why
she
had
left
her
husband
so
unkindly
she
answered
that
it
was
by
the
holy
will
of
god
and
at
the
command
of
holy
penance
and
that
she
could
never
live
with
her
husband
again
at
these
words
lamme
was
sad
but
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
beans
and
vinegar
and
outside
the
larks
sang
as
they
flew
upwards
into
the
sky
and
all
nature
swooned
away
under
the
caress
of
her
lord
the
sun
and
katheline
kept
stirring
with
her
spoon
that
pot
of
beans
and
sauce
xxv
now
in
those
days
a
damsel
some
fifteen
years
of
age
was
going
from
heyst
to
knokke
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
day
by
the
no
one
had
any
fear
for
her
for
they
knew
that
the
wolves
and
wicked
spirits
of
the
damned
go
biting
their
victims
only
in
the
night
the
damsel
carried
a
satchel
wherein
were
gold
coins
of
the
value
of
four
florins
carolus
being
the
sum
owed
by
the
girl
mother
toria
pieterson
who
lived
at
heyst
to
her
uncle
jan
rapen
of
knokke
on
account
of
a
sale
the
girl
name
was
betkin
and
she
was
wearing
her
best
clothes
and
she
went
on
her
way
most
happily
the
same
evening
seeing
that
she
did
not
return
her
mother
became
anxious
but
reassured
herself
with
the
thought
that
the
girl
must
have
stayed
the
night
with
her
uncle
on
the
morrow
certain
fishermen
on
their
way
back
from
the
sea
with
a
of
fish
drew
their
boat
on
to
the
beach
and
unloaded
their
catch
which
they
would
sell
at
auction
by
the
at
the
minque
of
heyst
they
went
up
the
road
along
the
dunes
all
strewn
with
shells
and
presently
came
upon
a
young
girl
stripped
naked
even
to
her
chemise
with
traces
of
blood
all
about
her
coming
nearer
they
found
upon
her
neck
the
horrid
marks
of
long
sharp
teeth
she
was
lying
on
her
back
with
her
eyes
wide
open
gazing
up
into
the
sky
and
her
mouth
was
open
also
as
if
with
the
cry
of
death
itself
covering
the
girl
body
with
an
they
brought
it
to
heyst
to
the
town
hall
and
there
quickly
assembled
the
aldermen
and
the
leech
who
declared
that
the
long
teeth
that
had
made
those
marks
were
no
teeth
of
a
wolf
as
known
in
nature
but
rather
of
some
wicked
and
devilish
werwolf
and
that
it
behoved
them
now
to
pray
god
one
and
all
that
he
would
deliver
the
land
of
flanders
and
in
all
that
country
and
notably
at
damme
at
heyst
and
at
knokke
prayers
and
orisons
were
ordered
to
be
made
but
ulenspiegel
went
to
the
town
bailiff
and
said
to
him
i
will
go
and
kill
the
werwolf
what
gives
you
this
confidence
asked
the
bailiff
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
heart
ulenspiegel
replied
only
give
me
leave
to
labour
a
while
at
the
forge
of
the
commune
very
well
said
the
bailiff
ulenspiegel
without
telling
a
word
concerning
his
project
to
any
man
or
woman
in
damme
betook
him
to
the
forge
and
there
in
secret
he
fashioned
a
fine
and
a
strong
trap
such
as
those
traps
which
are
made
to
catch
wild
beasts
on
the
following
day
which
was
a
saturday
day
beloved
of
werwolves
ulenspiegel
armed
himself
with
a
letter
from
the
bailiff
to
the
curé
of
heyst
together
with
the
trap
which
he
carried
under
his
cloak
as
well
as
a
good
crossbow
and
a
cutlass
thus
provided
he
departed
on
his
way
saying
to
those
in
damme
i
am
going
out
to
hunt
the
seagulls
and
of
their
down
will
i
make
a
soft
pillow
for
madame
the
wife
of
the
bailiff
now
before
he
reached
heyst
he
came
out
on
to
the
seashore
the
sea
was
rough
and
boisterous
and
he
heard
the
great
waves
growling
like
thunder
and
the
wind
that
blew
from
england
whistling
in
the
rigging
of
the
boats
that
were
stranded
on
the
beach
a
fisherman
said
to
him
this
bad
wind
will
be
our
ruin
last
night
the
sea
was
calm
but
at
sunrise
she
suddenly
swelled
with
anger
and
we
shall
not
be
able
to
go
out
fishing
ulenspiegel
was
pleased
at
this
for
he
knew
that
now
he
would
be
sure
of
some
assistance
if
need
arose
at
heyst
he
went
straight
to
the
curé
and
presented
the
letter
that
the
bailiff
had
given
him
the
curé
said
you
are
a
brave
man
but
let
me
tell
you
that
no
one
goes
along
the
dunes
on
saturday
nights
without
being
bitten
by
the
werwolf
and
left
dead
on
the
sands
even
the
men
who
are
at
work
on
the
dikes
never
go
there
except
in
a
party
the
evening
is
coming
on
do
you
not
hear
the
werwolf
howling
in
his
valley
perchance
he
will
come
again
into
the
cemetery
even
as
he
came
last
night
howling
most
horribly
through
all
the
hours
of
darkness
god
be
with
you
my
son
but
go
not
there
and
the
curé
crossed
himself
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
heart
answered
ulenspiegel
the
curé
said
because
you
have
so
brave
a
spirit
i
will
help
you
monsieur
le
curé
said
ulenspiegel
you
will
be
doing
a
great
kindness
as
well
to
me
as
to
this
poor
desolated
land
of
ours
if
you
will
go
to
toria
the
dead
girl
mother
and
to
her
two
brothers
also
and
tell
them
that
the
wolf
is
near
at
hand
and
that
i
am
going
out
to
wait
for
it
and
kill
it
the
curé
said
if
you
want
to
know
where
you
should
lie
in
wait
let
me
advise
you
to
keep
along
by
the
path
which
leads
to
the
cemetery
it
runs
between
two
hedges
of
broom
it
is
so
narrow
two
men
could
scarcely
walk
abreast
i
understand
said
ulenspiegel
and
you
brave
curé
will
you
tell
the
girl
mother
and
her
husband
and
her
brothers
to
come
themselves
and
wait
together
in
the
church
about
the
hour
of
the
curfew
there
if
they
hear
a
cry
like
the
cry
of
a
seagull
it
will
mean
that
i
have
seen
the
werwolf
then
they
must
sound
the
wacharm
on
the
bell
and
come
fast
to
my
assistance
and
if
there
are
any
other
brave
men
there
are
none
my
son
replied
the
curé
the
fishermen
are
less
afraid
of
the
plague
and
of
death
itself
than
of
the
werwolf
do
not
go
i
beseech
you
ulenspiegel
answered
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
heart
and
the
curé
said
to
him
i
will
do
as
you
bid
god
bless
you
are
you
hungry
or
thirsty
both
answered
ulenspiegel
the
curé
gave
him
some
beer
some
bread
and
some
cheese
and
ulenspiegel
when
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
went
his
way
and
as
he
walked
along
he
raised
his
eyes
and
beheld
claes
his
father
seated
in
glory
at
the
side
of
god
in
heaven
where
the
moon
shone
so
brightly
and
thereafter
he
gazed
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
clouds
and
he
heard
the
wind
that
came
blowing
stormily
from
england
alas
he
cried
o
dusky
clouds
that
pass
along
so
rapidly
yonder
in
the
sky
be
you
now
for
a
vengeance
on
the
murderer
and
you
o
wind
that
whistles
so
sadly
in
the
gorse
along
the
dunes
and
in
the
rigging
of
the
ships
be
you
now
the
voice
of
the
victims
that
cry
to
god
that
he
should
help
me
on
in
this
enterprise
and
so
saying
he
came
down
into
the
valley
stumbling
as
if
he
had
been
a
drunken
man
and
he
began
to
sing
hiccuping
all
the
time
staggering
from
side
to
side
yawning
spitting
and
then
standing
still
and
pretending
to
be
sick
but
all
the
time
he
was
keeping
his
eyes
wide
open
and
peering
this
way
and
that
for
he
had
heard
the
sharp
sound
as
of
a
wolf
howling
then
as
he
stood
there
vomiting
like
a
dog
he
descried
the
long
outline
of
a
wolf
moving
towards
the
cemetery
in
the
bright
light
of
the
moon
at
that
he
lurched
on
again
and
came
into
the
path
between
the
hedges
of
broom
there
he
pretended
to
fall
down
and
as
he
did
so
he
placed
his
trap
upon
the
side
from
which
the
wolf
was
coming
then
he
loaded
his
crossbow
and
went
forward
about
ten
paces
standing
up
again
in
a
drunken
posture
he
still
went
on
staggering
to
right
and
to
left
nor
did
he
cease
to
retch
and
to
hiccup
but
all
the
time
his
mind
was
taut
as
a
bowstring
and
he
was
all
eyes
and
ears
for
what
might
be
going
to
happen
yet
he
saw
nothing
save
the
dark
clouds
racing
in
the
sky
and
again
that
large
and
heavy
form
of
blackness
coming
down
the
path
towards
him
neither
did
he
hear
aught
but
the
dismal
wailing
of
the
wind
and
the
angry
thunder
of
the
sea
and
the
sound
that
the
shells
on
the
path
gave
forth
beneath
a
heavy
step
that
tapped
upon
them
feigning
to
be
about
to
sit
down
ulenspiegel
fell
forwards
on
to
the
path
very
heavily
like
a
drunken
man
after
that
he
heard
as
it
were
a
piece
of
iron
clinking
close
to
his
ear
and
then
the
sound
of
the
trap
shutting
and
a
human
voice
that
cried
out
in
the
darkness
the
werwolf
said
ulenspiegel
to
himself
he
got
his
front
paws
caught
in
the
trap
now
he
is
howling
and
trying
to
run
away
dragging
the
trap
with
him
but
he
shall
not
escape
and
he
drew
his
crossbow
and
shot
an
arrow
at
the
legs
of
the
werwolf
he
wounded
now
said
ulenspiegel
and
he
has
fallen
down
thereupon
he
whistled
like
a
seagull
and
straightway
the
church
bell
clanged
out
from
the
village
and
a
boy
shrill
voice
was
heard
crying
from
afar
off
awake
awake
you
sleepers
the
werwolf
is
caught
praise
be
to
god
said
ulenspiegel
now
the
first
to
arrive
on
the
scene
of
the
capture
were
toria
the
mother
of
betkin
and
lansaen
her
husband
and
her
two
brothers
josse
and
michael
and
they
brought
lanterns
with
them
you
have
caught
him
they
asked
look
on
the
path
answered
ulenspiegel
praise
be
to
god
they
exclaimed
crossing
themselves
who
is
it
that
is
calling
out
the
news
in
the
village
asked
ulenspiegel
it
is
my
eldest
boy
lansaen
answered
the
youngster
is
running
through
the
village
knocking
on
all
the
doors
and
crying
out
that
the
wolf
is
caught
praise
be
to
thee
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
heart
answered
ulenspiegel
suddenly
the
werwolf
began
to
speak
have
mercy
on
me
have
mercy
ulenspiegel
this
wolf
can
talk
they
exclaimed
crossing
themselves
again
he
is
a
devil
in
very
truth
and
knows
ulenspiegel
name
already
have
mercy
have
mercy
the
voice
cried
again
i
am
no
wolf
order
the
bell
to
stop
ringing
for
thus
it
is
that
it
tolls
for
the
dead
and
my
wrists
are
torn
by
the
trap
i
am
old
and
i
am
bleeding
have
mercy
and
what
is
this
this
shrill
voice
of
a
child
awakening
all
the
village
oh
pray
have
mercy
i
have
heard
your
voice
before
said
ulenspiegel
passionately
you
are
the
fishmonger
the
murderer
of
claes
the
vampire
that
preys
upon
poor
maids
have
no
fear
good
mother
and
father
this
is
none
other
than
the
dean
of
the
fishmongers
on
whose
account
poor
soetkin
died
of
grief
and
with
one
hand
he
held
the
man
fast
by
the
neck
and
with
the
other
he
drew
out
his
cutlass
but
toria
the
mother
of
betkin
prevented
him
take
him
alive
cried
she
take
him
alive
let
him
pay
meanwhile
there
were
many
fisherfolk
men
and
women
of
heyst
who
were
come
out
at
the
news
that
the
werwolf
was
taken
and
that
he
was
no
devil
but
a
man
some
of
these
carried
lanterns
and
flaming
torches
and
all
of
them
cried
aloud
when
they
saw
him
thief
murderer
where
hide
you
the
gold
that
you
have
stolen
from
your
poor
victims
he
shall
repay
it
all
said
toria
and
she
would
have
beaten
him
in
her
rage
had
she
not
fallen
down
there
and
then
upon
the
sand
in
a
mad
fury
like
unto
one
dead
and
they
left
her
there
until
she
came
to
herself
and
ulenspiegel
sad
at
heart
beheld
the
clouds
racing
like
mad
things
in
the
sky
and
out
at
sea
the
white
crests
of
the
waves
and
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
the
white
face
of
the
fishmonger
that
looked
up
at
him
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
with
cruel
eyes
and
the
ashes
beat
upon
his
heart
and
they
walked
for
four
hours
and
came
to
damme
where
was
a
great
crowd
assembled
that
already
was
aware
of
what
had
happened
every
one
desired
to
see
the
fishmonger
and
they
pressed
round
the
fishermen
and
fisherwives
crying
out
and
singing
and
dancing
and
saying
the
werwolf
is
caught
he
is
caught
the
murderer
blessed
be
ulenspiegel
long
live
our
brother
ulenspiegel
lange
leve
onzen
broeder
ulenspiegel
and
it
was
like
a
popular
rising
and
when
the
crowd
passed
in
front
of
the
bailiff
house
he
came
out
hearing
the
noise
and
said
to
ulenspiegel
you
are
the
conqueror
all
praise
to
you
it
was
the
ashes
of
claes
that
beat
upon
my
heart
said
ulenspiegel
then
the
bailiff
said
half
the
murderer
fortune
shall
be
yours
let
it
be
given
to
his
victims
answered
ulenspiegel
now
lamme
and
nele
were
there
too
nele
laughing
and
crying
with
joy
and
kissing
her
lover
lamme
jumping
heavily
and
striking
his
belly
while
he
cried
out
at
the
same
time
brave
trusty
and
true
my
comrade
my
you
can
not
match
him
anywhere
you
other
men
of
the
flat
country
but
the
fisherfolk
laughed
and
made
mock
of
lamme
xxvi
the
great
bell
the
borgstorm
rang
out
on
the
morrow
to
summon
to
the
vierschare
the
aldermen
and
the
clerks
of
the
court
there
they
sat
on
four
banks
of
turf
under
the
noble
which
was
called
the
tree
of
justice
and
round
about
stood
the
common
people
when
he
was
examined
the
fishmonger
would
confess
nothing
all
he
did
was
to
repeat
continually
i
am
poor
and
old
have
mercy
upon
me
but
the
people
howled
at
him
saying
you
are
an
old
wolf
destroyer
of
children
have
no
pity
sir
judges
let
him
pay
let
him
pay
cried
toria
but
the
fishmonger
entreated
again
most
piteously
i
am
poor
leave
me
alone
then
since
he
would
not
say
anything
of
his
own
free
will
he
was
condemned
to
be
tortured
until
he
should
confess
how
he
had
committed
the
murders
whence
he
came
and
where
he
had
hidden
the
remains
of
the
victims
and
their
money
so
now
he
was
brought
to
the
torture
chamber
and
on
his
feet
were
put
the
iron
shoes
of
torture
and
the
bailiff
asked
him
how
it
was
that
satan
had
inspired
him
with
designs
so
black
and
crimes
so
abominable
then
at
last
he
made
answer
satan
is
myself
my
essential
nature
even
as
a
child
ugly
as
i
was
and
unskilled
in
all
bodily
exercises
i
was
regarded
as
a
simpleton
by
every
one
and
was
continually
being
beaten
neither
girl
nor
boy
had
any
pity
for
me
and
as
i
grew
up
no
woman
would
have
anything
to
do
with
me
not
even
for
payment
so
i
conceived
a
hatred
for
the
whole
human
race
and
for
this
reason
i
betrayed
the
man
claes
who
was
beloved
by
all
thereafter
i
was
attracted
more
than
ever
by
the
idea
of
living
like
a
wolf
and
i
dreamed
of
tearing
flesh
with
my
teeth
and
i
killed
two
wolves
in
the
woods
of
raveschoet
and
maldeghem
and
i
sewed
together
their
two
skins
as
a
covering
and
by
day
and
by
night
i
wandered
along
the
and
especially
on
saturdays
the
day
of
the
market
at
bruges
then
the
bailiff
said
repent
and
pray
to
god
but
the
fishmonger
blasphemed
saying
it
is
god
himself
who
willed
me
to
be
as
i
am
i
did
all
in
spite
of
myself
led
on
by
the
will
of
nature
evil
tigers
that
you
are
you
will
punish
me
unjustly
but
he
was
condemned
to
die
the
death
and
toria
cried
aloud
justice
is
done
he
shall
pay
the
penalty
and
all
the
people
cried
lang
leve
de
heeren
van
de
wet
long
live
the
officers
of
the
law
the
next
morning
at
early
dawn
as
they
were
bringing
him
to
the
place
of
punishment
he
saw
ulenspiegel
standing
near
the
pile
and
he
pointed
his
finger
at
him
crying
there
is
a
man
who
ought
to
die
no
less
than
i
for
ten
years
ago
it
was
that
he
threw
me
into
the
damme
canal
because
i
had
denounced
his
father
but
in
that
i
had
acted
as
a
loyal
subject
to
his
most
catholic
majesty
and
the
bells
of
notre
dame
tolled
for
the
dead
for
you
also
the
bells
are
tolling
said
he
to
ulenspiegel
you
will
be
hanged
for
you
have
committed
murder
is
this
true
demanded
the
bailiff
ulenspiegel
answered
i
threw
into
the
water
the
man
who
denounced
claes
and
was
the
cause
of
his
death
the
ashes
of
my
father
beat
upon
my
heart
and
the
women
that
were
in
the
crowd
said
to
him
why
confess
it
ulenspiegel
no
one
saw
the
deed
but
now
you
also
will
die
the
death
and
the
prisoner
laughed
aloud
leaping
in
the
air
with
a
bitter
joy
he
will
die
he
said
he
will
leave
this
earth
for
hell
he
will
die
god
is
just
he
shall
not
die
said
the
bailiff
for
after
the
lapse
of
ten
years
no
murderer
can
lawfully
be
brought
to
punishment
in
the
land
of
flanders
ulenspiegel
did
a
wicked
act
but
it
was
done
for
love
of
his
father
and
for
such
a
deed
as
that
ulenspiegel
shall
not
be
summoned
to
trial
long
live
the
law
cried
the
crowd
lang
leve
de
wet
and
the
bells
of
notre
dame
tolled
for
the
dead
and
the
prisoner
ground
his
teeth
and
hung
his
head
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
let
fall
a
tear
and
his
hand
was
cut
off
and
his
tongue
pierced
with
a
iron
and
he
was
burned
alive
in
a
slow
fire
in
front
of
the
town
hall
and
toria
cried
out
he
is
paying
the
penalty
he
is
paying
the
penalty
see
how
they
writhe
those
arms
and
those
legs
which
helped
him
to
his
murdering
see
how
it
smokes
the
body
of
this
brute
burning
is
the
hair
of
him
all
pallid
like
the
hair
of
a
hyena
and
burning
is
his
pallid
face
he
pays
he
pays
and
the
fishmonger
died
howling
like
a
wolf
and
the
bells
of
notre
dame
tolled
for
the
dead
and
once
more
did
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
ride
away
on
their
donkeys
and
nele
stayed
behind
in
sorrow
with
katheline
who
never
stopped
her
ceaseless
refrain
put
out
the
fire
my
head
is
burning
come
back
come
back
to
me
hanske
my
pet
xxvii
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
had
come
to
and
behold
a
fleet
of
that
were
come
hither
from
ostend
and
from
blankenberghe
and
knokke
filled
they
were
with
the
followers
of
the
beggarmen
of
zeeland
who
carried
on
their
hats
a
silver
crescent
with
this
inscription
serve
rather
the
turk
than
the
pope
ulenspiegel
is
glad
he
whistles
like
the
lark
and
from
every
side
there
comes
to
answer
him
the
warlike
cockcrow
and
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
go
aboard
one
of
the
ships
and
are
carried
to
emden
and
thence
to
wieringen
where
their
ship
is
hemmed
in
by
the
ice
for
by
now
it
is
the
month
of
february
now
all
around
the
ship
there
was
to
be
seen
the
most
joyous
sight
imaginable
men
all
clad
in
velvet
sledging
and
skating
on
the
ice
and
women
skating
too
with
skirts
and
jackets
broidered
with
pearl
and
gold
blue
and
scarlet
and
the
boys
and
girls
came
and
went
hither
and
thither
laughing
and
following
one
another
in
line
or
two
by
two
in
couples
singing
the
song
of
love
upon
the
ice
and
running
to
eat
and
drink
at
the
stalls
decorated
with
flags
where
one
could
buy
all
kinds
of
and
oranges
and
figs
and
eggs
and
hot
vegetables
with
pancakes
that
is
with
vegetables
flavoured
with
vinegar
and
all
around
them
the
sailing
sledges
made
the
ice
to
resound
under
the
press
of
their
sharp
runners
lamme
who
was
still
searching
everywhere
for
his
wife
wandered
about
on
his
skates
like
the
rest
of
that
happy
crowd
but
he
kept
falling
down
time
and
again
ulenspiegel
meanwhile
to
satisfy
his
hunger
and
thirst
was
wont
to
resort
to
a
little
tavern
on
the
quay
where
the
prices
were
not
high
and
where
he
used
to
have
many
a
talk
with
the
old
lady
who
kept
it
one
sunday
about
nine
he
went
to
the
inn
and
asked
them
to
give
him
some
dinner
a
young
woman
came
forward
to
serve
him
dear
me
he
cried
you
rejuvenated
hostess
are
those
old
wrinkles
of
yours
gone
to
and
your
mouth
has
found
all
its
teeth
again
and
they
are
white
with
the
whiteness
of
youth
itself
and
your
lips
are
red
like
cherries
is
it
for
me
this
smile
of
yours
so
sweet
and
roguish
nay
nay
she
said
but
what
can
i
get
you
yourself
he
said
the
woman
answered
that
would
be
too
big
a
meal
for
a
lean
little
man
like
you
will
not
some
other
kind
of
meat
do
for
you
when
ulenspiegel
made
no
answer
what
have
you
done
she
said
with
that
handsome
but
rather
corpulent
gentleman
i
have
so
often
seen
in
your
company
do
you
mean
lamme
queried
ulenspiegel
yes
what
have
you
done
with
him
she
repeated
he
is
busy
eating
answered
ulenspiegel
eating
anything
he
can
set
his
teeth
upon
eggs
from
the
street
stalls
smoked
eels
and
salted
fish
and
all
this
forsooth
to
help
him
find
his
wife
but
why
are
you
not
she
my
sweet
would
you
like
fifty
florins
would
you
like
a
collar
of
gold
but
she
crossed
herself
saying
i
am
not
to
be
bought
nor
yet
taken
do
you
love
no
one
said
ulenspiegel
i
love
you
as
my
neighbour
but
above
all
i
love
our
lord
and
our
lady
they
that
command
me
to
live
an
honest
life
hard
indeed
and
oftentimes
burdensome
are
the
duties
that
are
laid
on
us
poor
women
nevertheless
god
gives
us
his
aid
yet
some
there
are
who
succumb
to
temptation
but
this
fat
friend
of
yours
come
tell
me
is
he
well
and
happy
ulenspiegel
answered
he
is
gay
when
he
is
eating
but
sad
and
pensive
when
he
is
empty
i
will
get
him
to
come
and
see
you
do
not
do
that
she
said
he
would
weep
and
so
should
i
have
you
ever
seen
his
wife
asked
ulenspiegel
she
sinned
with
him
once
the
woman
answered
and
was
condemned
therefor
to
a
cruel
punishment
she
knows
that
he
goes
in
the
cause
of
the
heretics
and
this
is
a
cruel
thought
for
a
christian
heart
but
protect
him
i
pray
you
if
he
is
attacked
and
nurse
him
if
he
is
wounded
his
wife
ordered
me
thus
to
entreat
you
lamme
is
my
brother
and
my
friend
answered
ulenspiegel
ah
she
said
but
why
will
you
not
return
to
the
bosom
of
our
holy
mother
church
she
eats
up
her
children
answered
ulenspiegel
and
he
departed
but
one
morning
in
march
while
still
the
cold
winds
of
winter
kept
the
ice
frozen
so
that
the
ship
of
the
beggarmen
could
not
make
away
ulenspiegel
came
again
to
the
tavern
and
the
pretty
baesine
said
to
him
and
there
was
great
emotion
and
sorrow
in
her
voice
poor
lamme
poor
ulenspiegel
why
do
you
pity
us
so
he
asked
her
alas
alas
she
cried
why
will
you
not
believe
in
the
mass
and
you
did
you
would
go
straight
to
paradise
without
a
doubt
and
i
might
be
able
to
save
you
in
this
life
also
seeing
her
go
to
the
door
and
listen
there
attentively
ulenspiegel
said
to
her
is
it
the
snow
that
you
hear
falling
no
she
said
what
then
it
is
death
that
comes
like
a
thief
in
the
night
death
exclaimed
ulenspiegel
i
do
not
understand
you
come
back
and
tell
me
they
are
there
she
said
who
are
who
she
said
why
the
soldiers
of
simonen
bol
who
are
about
to
come
in
the
name
of
the
duke
and
throw
themselves
upon
you
all
and
if
they
treat
you
well
while
you
are
here
it
is
only
as
men
treat
the
oxen
they
mean
to
kill
oh
why
she
cried
all
in
tears
why
did
i
not
know
all
this
before
so
that
i
could
have
warned
you
you
must
not
cry
said
ulenspiegel
and
you
must
stay
where
you
are
do
not
betray
me
she
said
ulenspiegel
went
out
of
the
house
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
and
went
round
to
all
the
booths
and
taverns
in
the
place
whispering
to
the
sailors
and
soldiers
these
words
the
spaniards
are
coming
at
that
they
ran
every
one
to
the
ship
and
prepared
with
all
the
haste
they
knew
whatever
things
were
necessary
for
battle
then
they
waited
for
the
evening
while
they
were
waiting
thus
ulenspiegel
said
to
lamme
do
you
see
that
woman
on
the
quay
there
in
a
black
dress
embroidered
with
scarlet
it
all
one
to
me
answered
lamme
i
am
cold
and
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
and
he
threw
his
great
cloak
around
his
head
and
became
like
a
man
who
was
deaf
but
presently
ulenspiegel
recognized
the
woman
and
cried
out
to
her
from
the
vessel
would
you
like
to
come
with
us
even
to
the
death
she
answered
but
i
can
not
then
she
came
nearer
to
the
ship
take
this
ointment
she
said
it
is
for
you
and
that
fat
friend
of
yours
who
goes
to
sleep
when
he
ought
to
be
awake
and
she
withdrew
herself
crying
lamme
lamme
may
god
keep
you
from
harm
and
bring
you
back
safe
and
she
uncovered
her
face
my
wife
my
wife
cried
lamme
and
he
would
have
jumped
down
to
her
your
faithful
wife
she
said
running
the
while
as
fast
as
ever
she
could
lamme
would
have
leaped
down
from
the
deck
on
to
the
ice
but
he
was
restrained
by
a
soldier
who
caught
him
by
his
cloak
and
the
provost
addressed
him
saying
you
will
be
hanged
if
you
leave
the
ship
yet
again
did
lamme
try
to
throw
himself
down
but
an
old
beggarman
held
him
back
telling
him
that
the
ice
was
damp
and
that
he
would
get
his
feet
wet
and
lamme
sat
down
on
the
deck
weeping
and
crying
ever
my
wife
my
wife
let
me
go
and
find
my
wife
you
will
see
her
again
said
ulenspiegel
she
loves
you
but
she
loves
god
more
mad
that
she
is
cried
lamme
if
she
loves
god
more
than
her
husband
why
does
she
show
herself
to
me
so
sweet
and
so
desirable
and
if
she
loves
me
why
does
she
leave
me
can
you
see
clearly
to
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
demanded
ulenspiegel
in
the
meanwhile
the
followers
of
simonen
bol
had
appeared
on
the
scene
with
a
large
force
of
artillery
they
shot
at
the
ship
which
promptly
repaid
them
in
similar
coin
and
the
bullets
broke
up
the
ice
all
around
and
towards
evening
a
warm
rain
began
to
fall
and
the
west
wind
blew
from
the
atlantic
and
the
sea
grew
angry
beneath
its
covering
of
ice
and
the
ice
was
broken
into
huge
blocks
which
could
be
seen
rising
and
falling
to
hurl
themselves
one
against
the
other
not
without
danger
to
the
ship
which
nevertheless
as
dawn
began
to
dissipate
the
clouds
of
night
opened
its
sails
like
a
bird
of
freedom
and
sailed
out
towards
the
open

there
they
were
joined
by
the

of
holland
and
zeeland
and
on
that
day
the
ship
of
messire
captured
a
vessel
from
biscay
that
carried
a
cargo
of
mercury
gunpowder
wine
and
spices
and
the
vessel
was
cleaned
to
its
marrow
emptied
of
its
men
and
its
booty
even
as
the
bone
of
an
ox
is
cleaned
by
the
teeth
of
a
lion
and
the
beggarmen
took

strong
naval

called
the
garden

it
was
at
the
beginning
of

proudly
on

ulenspiegel

they
struck

with

they
struck

they
have
bribed
us
most
vilely
and
spied
on
us
where
are
love
and
fidelity
now
in
exchange
for
those
sweetest
of
virtues
betrayal
and
fraud
have
they
heaped
on
us
yet
may
they
that
have
murdered
be

and
again
ulenspiegel
lifted
up
his
voice
and
sang

to
the
voice
of
the
people
murmuring
so
strong
in
the
distance
like
the

of
hate
and
scorn
closing
around
you
for
the
fair
land
of
flanders
the
gay
land
of
brabant
now
are
sad
as
a
churchyard
and
where
once
in
the
days
of
our
liberty
sounded
the

the

and
the
bagpipes

there
is
silence

all
the
glad
faces
of
those
that

made
love
to
the
sound
of
sweet
singing
now
is
naught
but
pale
faces
of
they
that
await
in
dumb
resignation
the
blade
of
the
sword
of
injustice
beat
the

the
drum

beat

the

beat
the
drum
long
live
the
beggarmen
and
all
the
sailors
and
soldiers
on
the
ship
of
ulenspiegel
and
they
also
that
were
on
the
ships
near
by
took
up
the
refrain
and
sang
out
also
the
sword
is
drawn
long
live
the
beggarmen
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
was
like
the
growl
of
the
thunder
of
deliverance
xxix
it
was
the
month
of
january
the
cruel
month
that
freezes
the
calf
in
the
womb
of
the
cow
snow
had
fallen
over
all
the
land
and
then
frozen
hard
the
boys
went
out
to
snare
with
the
sparrows
that
came
to
seek
what
nourishment
they
could
find
on
the
hardened
snow
and
whatever
they
took
they
brought
back
to
their
cottages
against
the
grey
bright
sky
the
skeletons
of
the
trees
detached
themselves
in
motionless
outline
and
their
branches
were
covered
as
it
were
with
cushions
of
snow
and
the
roofs
of
the
cottages
likewise
and
the
tops
of
the
walls
where
showed
the
footprints
of
the
cats
who
themselves
went
out
hunting
for
sparrows
in
the
snow
far
and
wide
the
fields
were
hidden
under
that
wonderful
white
fleece
which
warms
the
earth
against
the
bitter
cold
of
winter
the
smoke
of
houses
and
cottages
showed
black
as
it
mounted
heavenwards
and
over
everything
there
brooded
a
great
stillness
and
katheline
and
nele
lived
alone
in
their
cottage
and
katheline
wagged
her
head
crying
continually
hans
my
heart
is
yours
but
you
must
give
back
those
seven
hundred
caroluses
put
out
the
fire
my
head
is
burning
alas
where
are
your
kisses
cold
as
snow
and
she
stood
watching
at
the
window
suddenly
a
horseman
rode
past
at
the
gallop
crying
here
comes
the
bailiff
the
high
bailiff
of
damme
and
he
went
on
to
the
town
hall
crying
out
all
the
time
so
as
to
gather
together
the
burghers
and
the
aldermen
and
thereafter
in
the
silence
that
ensued
nele
could
hear
two
blasts
of
a
trumpet
and
straightway
all
the
people
of
damme
came
running
to
their
doors
thinking
that
it
must
be
no
less
a
personage
than
his
royal
majesty
himself
whose
arrival
was
announced
by
such
a
fanfare
and
katheline
also
went
to
her
door
with
nele
and
in
the
distance
she
could
see
a
troop
of
splendid
horsemen
riding
all
together
and
at
their
head
a
magnificent
figure
in
a
cloak
of
black
velvet
edged
with
sable
and
she
knew
him
at
once
for
the
high
bailiff
of
damme
now
behind
him
there
rode
a
company
of
youthful
lords
clad
in
long
cloaks
and
they
rode
along
gaily
and
their
coats
were
adorned
with
buttons
and
trimmings
of
gold
and
their
hats
with
long
ostrich
plumes
waving
gaily
in
the
wind
and
they
seemed
one
and
all
to
be
good
comrades
and
friends
of
the
high
bailiff
and
conspicuous
among
them
was
a
gentleman
dressed
in
green
velvet
and
gold
trimmings
and
like
the
others
his
cloak
was
of
black
velvet
and
his
hat
also
was
adorned
with
black
plumes
and
his
nose
was
like
a
vulture
beak
his
mouth
compressed
and
thin
and
his
beard
was
red
and
his
face
pale
and
very
proud
was
his
bearing
while
the
company
of
gentlemen
was
passing
before
the
cottage
katheline
suddenly
ran
forward
and
leapt
at
the
bridle
of
the
pale
horseman
and
cried
out
mad
with
joy
as
it
seemed
hans
my
beloved
i
knew
you
would
come
back
oh
you
are
beautiful
like
this
all
clad
in
velvet
and
gold
shining
like
a
sun
against
the
snow
have
you
brought
me
those
seven
hundred
caroluses
shall
i
hear
you
again
crying
like
the
the
high
bailiff
brought
the
cavalcade
to
a
stand
and
the
pale
gentleman
said
what
does
this
want
with
me
but
katheline
still
holding
the
horse
by
the
bridle
made
answer
you
must
be
dreaming
hans
wake
up
from
your
dream
i
have
cried
for
you
so
long
o
nights
of
love
my
beloved
o
kisses
of
snow
o
body
of
ice
see
this
is
your
child
and
she
pointed
to
nele
who
was
gazing
at
the
man
with
terror
for
now
he
had
raised
his
whip
as
though
he
were
about
to
strike
at
katheline
but
katheline
still
continued
her
entreaties
weeping
all
the
time
ah
do
you
not
remember
have
pity
on
your
servant
take
her
with
you
whithersoever
you
will
put
out
the
fire
hans
have
pity
get
out
of
the
way
he
said
and
he
urged
on
his
steed
so
quickly
that
katheline
was
forced
to
loose
hold
of
the
bridle
and
she
fell
on
to
the
road
and
the
horse
went
over
her
leaving
a
bleeding
wound
upon
her
forehead
then
the
bailiff
inquired
of
the
pale
horseman
as
to
whether
he
knew
aught
of
the
woman
i
know
her
not
was
the
answer
she
is
out
of
her
wits
doubtless
but
by
this
time
nele
had
helped
up
katheline
from
the
ground
if
this
woman
is
mad
she
said
at
least
my
lord
i
am
not
and
i
am
ready
to
die
here
and
now
of
this
snow
that
i
am
eating
and
here
nele
took
and
ate
of
the
snow
with
her
fingers
if
this
horseman
has
not
had
knowledge
of
my
mother
and
if
he
has
not
forced
her
to
lend
him
money
nay
all
the
money
that
she
had
and
if
it
was
not
he
that
killed
the
dog
which
belonged
to
claes
so
that
he
might
take
from
the
wall
of
the
well
those
seven
hundred
caroluses
which
belonged
to
the
poor
man
that
is
dead
hans
my
pet
sobbed
katheline
give
me
the
kiss
of
peace
time
was
when
you
killed
your
friend
because
you
were
jealous
by
the
dike
you
loved
me
well
in
those
days
who
is
that
man
she
speaks
of
demanded
the
bailiff
i
know
not
said
the
pale
horseman
the
talk
of
this
is
no
concern
of
ours
let
us
move
on
but
by
now
a
crowd
of
people
had
collected
workpeople
of
the
town
and
they
all
began
to
take
katheline
part
crying
justice
justice
my
lord
bailiff
justice
and
the
bailiff
said
to
nele
who
is
the
one
that
was
killed
speak
the
truth
in
god
name
then
nele
said
her
say
pointing
the
while
at
the
pale
horseman
this
is
the
man
who
came
every
saturday
to
the
keet
to
visit
my
mother
and
to
take
her
money
from
her
he
killed
one
of
his
own
friends
hilbert
by
name
in
the
field
of
servaes
van
der
vichte
and
this
he
did
not
from
any
love
of
katheline
as
she
in
her
innocent
folly
believes
but
rather
that
he
might
get
hold
of
her
seven
hundred
caroluses
and
keep
them
all
for
himself
you
lie
said
the
pale
horseman
oh
no
said
nele
for
it
is
you
that
caused
the
death
of
soetkin
you
that
reduced
her
orphan
son
to
misery
you
nobleman
that
you
are
who
came
to
us
common
people
and
the
first
time
you
came
you
brought
money
to
my
mother
so
that
ever
afterwards
you
might
take
her
money
from
her
and
you
it
is
that
introduced
into
our
house
that
friend
of
yours
to
whom
you
would
have
given
me
in
marriage
but
as
you
know
i
would
have
none
of
him
what
did
he
do
your
friend
hilbert
that
time
i
tore
his
eyes
with
my
nele
is
naughty
said
katheline
you
must
not
pay
any
attention
to
her
hans
my
pet
she
is
angry
because
hilbert
tried
to
take
her
by
force
but
hilbert
can
not
do
so
any
more
the
worms
have
eaten
him
and
hilbert
was
ugly
hans
my
pet
it
is
you
alone
that
are
beautiful
and
nele
she
is
naughty
now
the
bailiff
ordered
the
women
to
go
about
their
business
but
katheline
would
not
budge
from
where
she
stood
they
were
obliged
therefore
to
take
her
into
the
cottage
by
force
and
all
the
people
that
were
there
assembled
began
to
cry
out
justice
my
lord
justice
at
this
moment
the
sergeants
of
the
commune
came
upon
the
scene
attracted
by
the
noise
and
the
bailiff
bidding
them
wait
addressed
himself
to
the
lords
and
nobles
in
the
following
manner
my
lords
and
gentlemen
notwithstanding
all
those
privileges
which
protect
the
illustrious
order
of
the
nobility
of
flanders
i
find
myself
constrained
to
arrest
joos
damman
on
account
of
the
accusations
which
have
been
brought
against
him
and
i
therefore
order
him
to
be
confined
to
prison
until
such
time
as
he
can
be
brought
to
trial
according
to
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
empire
hand
me
then
your
sword
sir
joos
at
this
command
joos
damman
was
seen
to
hesitate
but
all
the
people
cried
out
as
with
one
voice
justice
my
lord
justice
let
him
deliver
up
his
sword
and
he
was
obliged
to
do
so
in
spite
of
himself
and
when
he
had
dismounted
from
his
horse
he
was
conducted
by
the
sergeants
to
the
prison
of
the
commune
nevertheless
he
was
not
confined
in
one
of
the
dungeons
but
was
placed
in
a
room
with
barred
windows
where
for
a
payment
of
money
he
was
made
not
too
uncomfortable
for
he
was
provided
with
a
fire
a
good
bed
and
some
good
food
half
of
which
however
went
to
the
gaoler
xxx
on
the
morrow
there
came
a
soft
wind
blowing
from
brabant
the
snow
began
to
melt
and
the
meadows
were
all
flooded
and
the
bell
that
is
called
borgstorm
summoned
the
judges
to
the
tribunal
of
the
vierschare
and
they
sat
under
the
penthouse
because
the
grassy
banks
where
they
were
accustomed
to
sit
were
too
damp
and
round
about
the
tribunal
stood
the
people
of
the
town
joos
damman
was
brought
before
the
judges
he
was
not
in
bonds
and
he
still
wore
the
dress
of
a
nobleman
katheline
was
also
brought
there
but
her
hands
were
tied
in
front
of
her
and
she
wore
a
grey
dress
the
dress
of
a
prisoner
on
being
examined
joos
damman
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
of
having
killed
his
friend
hilbert
with
a
sword
in
single
combat
and
this
he
confessed
willingly
because
as
he
said
he
was
protected
by
the
law
of
flanders
which
made
a
murderer
safe
from
conviction
after
the
space
of
ten
years
then
the
bailiff
asked
him
if
he
was
a
sorcerer
no
replied
damman
prove
it
said
the
bailiff
that
i
will
do
at
the
right
time
and
in
the
proper
place
said
joos
damman
but
not
now
then
the
bailiff
began
to
question
katheline
she
however
paid
no
attention
to
his
questions
but
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
hans
saying
you
are
my
green
master
beautiful
you
are
as
the
sun
himself
put
out
the
fire
my
pet
then
nele
spoke
on
katheline
behalf
she
can
tell
you
naught
my
lord
that
you
do
not
know
already
she
is
not
a
sorceress
she
is
only
out
of
her
mind
then
the
bailiff
said
his
say
a
sorcerer
i
would
remind
you
is
one
who
knowingly
employs
a
devilish
art
or
devilish
arts
for
the
attainment
of
a
certain
object
well
these
two
persons
the
man
and
the
woman
i
find
to
be
sorcerers
both
in
intention
and
in
fact
the
man
because
as
the
evidence
states
he
gave
to
this
woman
the
balm
of
the
sabbath
and
made
his
visage
like
unto
lucifer
so
as
to
obtain
money
from
her
and
the
satisfaction
of
his
wanton
desires
and
the
woman
also
i
find
to
be
a
sorceress
because
she
submitted
herself
to
the
man
taking
him
for
a
devil
and
abandoning
herself
to
his
will
i
ask
therefore
if
the
gentlemen
of
the
tribunal
are
agreed
that
it
is
a
case
where
the
prisoners
should
both
be
sent
to
the
torture
the
aldermen
did
not
answer
but
showed
clearly
enough
that
such
was
not
their
desire
so
far
at
any
rate
as
katheline
was
concerned
then
the
bailiff
spake
again
like
you
i
am
moved
with
pity
and
compassion
for
the
woman
but
mad
as
she
undoubtedly
is
and
obedient
in
all
things
to
the
devil
is
it
not
probable
that
at
the
behest
of
her
leman
she
might
have
committed
the
most
horrible
crimes
and
abominations
as
do
all
those
who
resign
themselves
to
the
devil
will
no
since
joos
damman
has
refused
to
acknowledge
any
crime
save
that
of
murder
and
since
katheline
has
not
told
us
anything
at
all
it
is
clear
that
by
the
laws
of
the
empire
we
are
bound
to
proceed
in
the
manner
i
have
indicated
and
the
aldermen
gave
sentence
to
the
effect
that
the
two
prisoners
were
to
be
committed
to
torture
on
the
following
friday
which
was
the
day
but
one
following
and
nele
cried
out
for
mercy
upon
katheline
and
the
people
joined
with
her
in
supplication
but
all
in
vain
and
the
prisoners
were
taken
back
into
the
gaol
there
by
order
of
the
tribunal
the
keeper
of
the
gaol
was
ordered
to
provide
a
couple
of
guards
for
each
prisoner
and
these
guards
were
commanded
to
beat
them
whenever
they
looked
like
going
off
to
sleep
now
the
two
guards
that
were
allotted
to
katheline
suffered
her
to
sleep
during
the
night
but
they
that
were
assigned
to
joos
damman
beat
him
unmercifully
every
time
that
he
closed
his
eyes
or
even
hung
his
head
down
and
neither
of
the
prisoners
was
given
anything
to
eat
through
all
that
wednesday
and
through
all
the
night
and
day
which
followed
but
on
the
thursday
evening
they
were
given
food
and
drink
meat
that
is
to
say
which
had
been
soaked
in
salt
and
saltpetre
and
water
which
had
been
salted
in
a
similar
fashion
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
their
torture
and
in
the
morning
crying
out
with
thirst
they
were
led
by
the
sergeants
into
the
chamber
of
doom
there
they
were
set
opposite
to
one
another
bound
as
they
were
each
to
a
separate
bench
which
itself
was
covered
with
knotted
cords
that
hurt
them
grievously
and
they
were
both
made
to
drink
a
glass
of
water
saturated
with
salt
and
saltpetre
joos
damman
began
to
fall
off
to
sleep
where
he
was
but
the
sergeants
soon
beat
him
awake
again
and
katheline
said
do
not
beat
him
kind
sirs
he
has
committed
but
a
single
crime
when
he
killed
hilbert
and
that
was
done
for
love
sake
oh
but
i
am
thirsty
and
you
also
are
thirsty
hans
my
beloved
pray
give
him
something
to
drink
first
of
all
water
water
my
body
is
burning
me
up
but

water
joos
said
to

ugly
old
witch
that
you
are
go
and
die
for
all
i
care
throw
her
into
the
fire
my
lords
oh
but
i
am
thirsty
meanwhile
the
clerks
of
the
court
were
busy
writing
down
every
word
that
was
being
said
and
the
bailiff
asked
him
have
you
nothing
to
confess
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
replied
damman
you
know
all
that
there
is
to
know
forasmuch
as
he
persists
in
his
denials
said
the
bailiff
let
him
remain
where
he
is
until
he
shall
have
made
a
complete
avowal
of
his
crimes
let
him
neither
eat
nor
drink
nor
go
to
sleep
so
be
it
said
joos
damman
and
i
will
amuse
myself
by
watching
the
sufferings
of
this
old
witch
here
and
katheline
answered
him
saying
cold
arms
warm
heart
hans
my
beloved
i
am
thirsty
my
head
is
burning
the
clerk
of
the
court
wrote
down
what
she
said
and
the
bailiff
asked
her
woman
have
you
nothing
to
say
in
your
own
defence
but
katheline
only
gazed
at
joos
damman
and
said
very
amorously
it
is
the
hour
of
the
hans
my
pet
they
say
that
you
will
give
me
back
the
seven
hundred
caroluses
put
out
the
fire
put
out
the
fire
then
she
began
to
cry
out
most
horribly
water
water
my
head
is
burning
god
and
his
angels
are
eating
apples
in
heaven
and
she
lost
consciousness
thereupon
the
bailiff
ordered
her
to
be
released
from
the
bench
of
torture
which
was
done
and
thereafter
she
was
seen
to
stagger
to
and
fro
because
of
her
feet
which
were
all
swollen
from
the
cords
that
had
been
bound
too
tight
give
her
to
drink
said
the
bailiff
and
they
gave
her
some
fresh
water
which
she
swallowed
greedily
holding
the
goblet
between
her
teeth
as
a
dog
holds
a
bone
and
refusing
to
let
it
go
then
they
gave
her
more
water
and
this
she
would
have
carried
over
to
joos
damman
had
not
the
torturer
wrested
the
goblet
from
her
hand
and
she
fell
down
asleep
like
a
piece
of
lead
but
joos
damman
cried
out
in
his
fury
i
also
am
thirsty
and
sleepy
why
do
you
give
her
to
drink
why
do
you
let
her
fall
asleep
she
is
a
woman
answered
the
bailiff
and
she
is
weak
and
out
of
her
mind
her
madness
is
only
pretence
said
joos
damman
she
is
a
witch
i
want
to
drink
and
i
want
to
sleep
and
he
closed
his
eyes
but
his
tormentors
struck
him
in
the
face
give
me
a
knife
he
cried
that
i
may
cut
these
varlets
in
pieces
i
am
a
nobleman
no
one
has
ever
struck
me
in
the
face
before
water
let
me
sleep
i
am
innocent
it
is
not
i
that
took
the
seven
hundred
caroluses
it
was
hilbert
water
i
have
never
committed
any
sorceries
nor
any
incantations
i
am
innocent
leave
me
alone
and
give
me
something
to
drink
but
the
bailiff
only
asked
him
how
he
had
passed
the
time
after
he
left
katheline
i
do
not
know
katheline
at
all
he
said
therefore
i
never
left
her
you
have
asked
me
an
unfair
question
and
i
am
not
bound
to
answer
it
give
me
something
to
drink
let
me
go
to
sleep
i
tell
you
it
was
hilbert
who
was
responsible
for
everything
take
him
away
said
the
bailiff
put
him
back
into
his
prison
but
see
that
he
has
nothing
to
drink
and
that
he
does
not
fall
asleep
until
he
has
admitted
his
sorceries
and
incantations
and
now
damman
suffered
the
most
cruel
torture
of
all
and
he
cried
out
continually
in
his
prison
water
water
and
so
loudly
did
he
cry
that
the
people
outside
could
hear
him
nevertheless
they
felt
no
pity
for
him
and
when
he
began
to
fall
off
to
sleep
the
guards
struck
him
in
the
face
and
he
cried
out
again
like
a
tiger
i
am
a
nobleman
and
i
will
kill
you
you
varlets
i
will
go
to
the
king
our
master
water
but
he
would
confess
nothing
at
all
and
they
left
him
where
he
was
xxxi
it
was
the
month
of
may
the
tree
of
justice
was
green
again
green
also
were
those
grassy
banks
where
the
judges
were
wont
to
seat
themselves
nele
was
summoned
to
give
evidence
for
it
was
the
day
on
which
the
judgment
was
to
be
promulgated
and
the
people
men
and
women
of
damme
stood
around
the
open
space
of
the
court
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
katheline
and
joos
damman
were
now
brought
before
the
tribunal
and
damman
appeared
more
pale
than
ever
because
of
the
torture
he
had
suffered
the
many
nights
he
had
passed
without
sleep
or
anything
to
drink
as
for
katheline
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
on
her
tottering
legs
and
she
pointed
to
the
sun
continually
and
cried
out
put
out
the
fire
my
head
is
burning
and
she
gazed
at
joos
damman
with
tender
love
and
he
looked
back
at
her
with
hate
and
despite
and
his
friends
the
lords
and
gentlemen
who
had
been
summoned
to
damme
were
all
present
there
before
the
tribunal
as
witnesses
then
the
bailiff
spoke
as
follows
the
girl
nele
here
who
is
protecting
her
mother
katheline
with
such
great
and
brave
affection
has
found
sewn
into
the
pocket
of
katheline
sunday
dress
a
letter
signed
by
joos
damman
and
i
myself
when
i
was
inspecting
the
dead
body
of
hilbert
ryvish
which
was
dug
up
in
the
field
near
katheline
cottage
found
thereon
a
second
letter
addressed
to
him
and
signed
by
the
said
joos
damman
the
accused
now
present
before
you
is
it
your
pleasure
that
these
letters
be
now
read
to
you
read
them
read
them
cried
the
crowd
nele
is
a
brave
girl
read
the
letters
katheline
is
no
witch
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
read
out
as
follows
to
hilbert
son
of
william
ryvish
knight
joos
damman
knight
greeting
most
excellent
friend
let
me
advise
you
to
lose
no
more
of
your
money
in
gambling
dicing
and
other
foolishness
of
that
kind
i
will
tell
you
a
way
of
making
money
safe
and
sound
my
plan
is
that
we
should
disguise
ourselves
as
devils
such
as
are
beloved
by
women
and
girls
and
then
choose
out
for
ourselves
all
the
pretty
ones
leaving
alone
all
such
as
are
ugly
or
poor
for
we
will
make
them
pay
for
their
pleasure
do
you
know
that
when
i
was
in
germany
i
acquired
by
this
means
as
much
as
five
thousand
rixdaelders
and
all
within
the
space
of
six
months
for
a
woman
will
give
her
last
denier
to
the
man
she
loves
when
therefore
such
an
one
is
willing
to
receive
you
in
the
night
the
thing
is
to
announce
your
coming
by
crying
like
a
so
it
may
seem
that
you
are
really
and
truly
a
devil
and
if
you
want
to
make
your
countenance
appear
devilish
you
must
rub
it
all
over
with
phosphorus
for
phosphorus
burns
when
it
is
damp
and
the
smell
of
it
is
horrible
and
the
women
mistake
it
for
the
odour
of
hell
itself
and
if
anything
gets
in
your
way
be
it
man
woman
or
beast
kill
it
before
long
we
will
go
together
to
one
katheline
a
handsome
woman
i
know
and
she
has
a
daughter
a
child
of
mine
forsooth
if
indeed
katheline
has
proved
faithful
to
me
and
she
is
a
right
comely
lass
and
i
give
her
to
you
for
these
bastards
are
nothing
to
me
and
you
must
know
that
i
have
already
had
from
the
mother
a
sum
of
three
and
twenty
caroluses
this
money
all
belonged
to
her
but
somewhere
unless
i
am
a
dunce
she
keeps
secreted
the
fortune
of
claes
that
heretic
you
remember
who
was
burned
alive
at
damme
seven
hundred
caroluses
in
all
and
liable
to
confiscation
but
the
good
king
philip
who
has
burned
so
many
of
his
subjects
for
the
sake
of
their
inheritance
can
not
lay
his
claw
upon
this
and
assuredly
it
will
weigh
heavier
in
my
purse
than
ever
it
would
in
his
katheline
will
tell
me
where
it
is
hidden
and
we
will
share
it
between
us
fortune
favours
the
young
as
his
sacred
majesty
charles
v
was
never
tired
of
saying
and
he
was
a
past
master
in
all
the
arts
of
love
and
war
here
the
clerk
of
the
court
stopped
reading
and
said
such
is
the
letter
and
it
is
signed
joos
damman
and
the
people
cried
out
to
the
death
with
the
murderer
to
the
death
with
the
sorcerer
but
the
bailiff
ordered
them
to
keep
silence
so
that
judgment
might
be
passed
on
the
prisoners
with
every
form
of
freedom
and
legality
after
that
he
addressed
himself
again
to
the
aldermen
now
i
will
read
to
you
the
second
letter
which
is
the
letter
nele
found
sewn
into
the
pocket
of
katheline
sunday
gown
these
are
the
terms
of
it
sweet
witch
here
is
the
recipe
of
a
mixture
which
was
sent
to
me
by
the
wife
of
lucifer
himself
by
the
aid
of
this
mixture
it
is
possible
to
be
transported
to
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
you
can
hold
converse
with
the
elemental
spirits
who
carry
the
prayers
of
men
to
god
and
can
traverse
the
cities
towns
rivers
and
fields
of
all
the
world
mix
equal
parts
of
the
following
stramonium
solanum
somniferum
henbane
opium
fresh
ends
of
hemp
belladonna
and
then
drink
if
it
is
your
wish
we
will
go
this
very
night
to
the
sabbath
of
the
spirits
but
you
must
love
me
more
and
not
be
cold
to
me
like
you
were
the
other
night
refusing
to
give
me
even
ten
florins
and
denying
that
you
had
got
them
for
i
know
very
well
you
have
a
treasure
in
your
hiding
but
will
not
tell
me
where
do
you
not
love
me
any
more
my
sweetheart
your
cold
devil
hanske
to
death
with
the
sorcerer
cried
the
crowd
the
bailiff
said
let
the
two
handwritings
be
compared
when
this
had
been
done
and
when
it
had
been
found
that
they
were
in
all
respects
similar
the
bailiff
said
after
these
proofs
messire
joos
damman
is
found
to
be
a
sorcerer
a
murderer
a
seducer
of
women
a
robber
of
the
property
of
the
king
and
as
such
he
must
be
accounted
guilty
of
high
treason
against
god
and
man
and
the
bailiff
and
the
aldermen
gave
judgment
on
joos
damman
and
he
was
condemned
to
be
degraded
from
the
rank
of
a
nobleman
and
to
be
burned
alive
in
the
slower
fire
till
death
supervened
and
he
underwent
this
punishment
on
the
following
day
in
front
of
the
town
hall
and
all
the
time
he
kept
on
crying
let
the
witch
perish
it
is
she
and
she
alone
who
is
guilty
cursed
be
god
my
father
will
avenge
me
and
the
people
said
behold
how
he
curses
and
blasphemes
he
is
dying
the
death
of
a
dog
on
the
next
day
the
bailiff
and
the
aldermen
gave
sentence
upon
katheline
she
was
condemned
to
undergo
the
trial
by
water
in
the
bruges
canal
if
she
floated
she
would
be
burned
for
a
witch
if
she
sank
and
was
drowned
she
would
be
considered
to
have
died
the
death
of
a
christian
and
would
be
buried
in
the
churchyard
so
on
the
morrow
katheline
was
conducted
to
the
holding
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
walking
barefoot
in
a
shift
of
black
linen
along
by
the
trees
went
the
long
procession
in
front
was
the
dean
of
notre
dame
chanting
the
prayers
for
the
dead
and
with
him
were
his
vicars
and
the
beadle
carrying
the
cross
behind
came
the
bailiff
of
damme
the
aldermen
the
clerks
the
sergeants
of
the
commune
the
provost
the
executioner
and
his
two
assistants
on
the
edge
of
the
procession
there
followed
a
great
crowd
of
women
crying
and
men
mourning
in
pity
for
katheline
who
herself
walked
like
a
lamb
that
allows
itself
to
be
led
whither
it
knows
not
and
all
the
time
she
kept
on
crying
put
out
the
fire
my
head
is
burning
hans
where
are
you
in
the
midst
of
the
women
was
nele
who
kept
crying
also
let
them
throw
me
in
with
her
but
the
women
did
not
suffer
her
to
come
near
to
katheline
a
sharp
wind
came
blowing
in
from
the
sea
and
from
the
grey
sky
a
fine
hail
fell
dripping
into
the
water
of
the
canal
now
there
was
a
boat
moored
by
the
side
of
the
water
and
this
boat
the
executioner
and
his
assistants
commandeered
in
the
name
of
his
royal
majesty
then
katheline
was
ordered
to
step
down
into
the
boat
she
obeyed
at
once
and
the
executioner
was
seen
standing
by
her
side
and
holding
her
securely
then
the
provost
raised
the
rod
of
justice
and
the
executioner
threw
katheline
into
the
canal
for
a
while
she
struggled
but
soon
sank
with
one
last
cry
hans
hans
help
and
the
people
said
this
woman
was
no
witch
thereafter
certain
men
who
were
there
jumped
into
the
canal
and
dragged
katheline
out
again
senseless
and
rigid
as
one
dead
and
she
was
taken
into
a
tavern
near
by
and
placed
in
front
of
a
bright
fire
nele
took
off
her
garments
wringing
wet
as
they
were
meaning
to
put
dry
ones
on
her
after
a
while
she
regained
consciousness
and
cried
out
all
trembling
and
with
her
teeth
chattering
hans
give
me
a
cloak
of
wool
but
katheline
could
not
be
warmed
and
on
the
third
day
she
died
and
she
was
buried
in
the
garden
of
the
church
and
nele
the
orphan
went
away
into
holland
and
dwelt
at
the
house
of
rosa
van
auweghem
xxxii
in
those
days
it
was
that
the
beggarmen
among
whom
were
lamme
and
ulenspiegel
took
the
city
of
gorcum
by
storm
and
they
were
led
in
this
enterprise
by
one
captain
marin
this
marin
had
once
been
a
workman
on
the
dikes
but
now
he
bore
himself
with
great
haughtiness
and
effrontery
and
he
signed
an
agreement
with
gaspard
turc
the
defender
of
gorcum
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
the
city
should
capitulate
on
condition
that
turc
himself
together
with
the
monks
citizens
and
soldiers
who
had
been
shut
up
in
the
citadel
should
be
allowed
to
pass
out
freely
their
muskets
on
their
shoulders
and
with
anything
that
they
could
carry
with
them
save
only
what
belonged
to
the
churches
which
was
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
victors
but
in
spite
of
this
agreement
captain
marin
acting
under
an
order
from
messire
de
lumey
detained
nineteen
monks
as
his
prisoners
while
the
rest
of
the
citizens
were
allowed
to
go
free
as
had
been
promised
and
ulenspiegel
said
word
of
a
soldier
word
of
gold
why
has
the
captain
been
false
to
his
promise
an
old
beggarman
answered
ulenspiegel
the
monks
are
the
sons
of
satan
the
canker
of
our
nation
the
shame
of
our
country
dogs
are
chained
up
let
the
monks
be
also
chained
for
they
are
the
bloodhounds
of
the
duke
long
live
the
beggarmen
but
answered
ulenspiegel
we
must
remember
that
my
lord
of
orange
the
prince
of
liberty
has
ordered
us
to
respect
the
property
and
the
free
conscience
of
all
such
as
give
themselves
up
into
our
power
some
of
the
older
beggarmen
replied
that
the
admiral
could
not
do
so
in
the
case
of
the
monks
and
he
is
master
here
they
added
it
was
he
that
took
la
brièle
to
prison
with
the
monks
a
soldier
word
is
a
word
of
gold
said
ulenspiegel
parole
de
soldat
parole
why
should
we
ever
break
our
word
no
longer
do
the
ashes
beat
upon
your
heart
they
told
him
hear
you
not
the
souls
of
the
dead
that
cry
for
vengeance
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
heart
said
ulenspiegel
parole
de

parole
the
next
day
a
message
arrived
from
messire
de
lumey
to
the
effect
that
the
nineteen
monks
were
to
be
brought
as
prisoners
from
gorcum
to
la
brièle
where
the
admiral
was
then
stationed
they
will
be
hanged
said
captain
marin
to
ulenspiegel
not
as
long
as
i
am
alive
said
ulenspiegel
my
son
said
lamme
you
must
not
speak
in
this
way
to
messire
de
lumey
he
is
a
stern
man
and
will
have
you
hanged
as
well
as
the
monks
if
you
are
not
careful
i
shall
tell
him
the
truth
answered
ulenspiegel
parole
de
soldat
parole
if
you
think
that
you
can
save
them
said
marin
i
will
give
you
permission
to
go
with
them
by
ship
to
la
brièle
take
rochus
with
you
as
pilot
and
your
friend
lamme
if
you
please
as
well
i
will
said
ulenspiegel
the
ship
was
moored
by
the
quay
side
and
the
nineteen
monks
were
taken
aboard
rochus
took
charge
of
the
helm
while
ulenspiegel
and
lamme
placed
themselves
at
the
bow
certain
vagabond
soldiers
who
had
joined
the
beggarmen
for
the
sake
of
plunder
were
stationed
by
the
monks
who
now
began
to
wax
hungry
ulenspiegel
gave
them
food
and
drink
then
the
sailors
began
to
murmur
one
to
another
saying
this
man
is
a
traitor
meanwhile
the
nineteen
monks
were
seated
sanctimoniously
in
the
midst
and
they
were
shivering
although
the
month
was
july
and
the
sun
was
shining
hot
and
clear
and
a
gentle
breeze
filled
the
sails
of
the
ship
as
it
glided
heavy
and
over
the
green
waves
father
nicholas
then
began
to
speak
addressing
himself
to
the
pilot
o
rochus
he
said
are
they
taking
us
to
the
then
turning
his
face
towards
gorcum
o
city
of
gorcum
he
cried
stretching
out
his
hands
o
city
of
gorcum
how
many
evils
hast
thou
still
to
suffer
verily
thou
shalt
be
cursed
among
all
the
cities
of
the
earth
for
thou
hast
nurtured
within
thy
walls
the
seed
of
heresy
o
city
of
gorcum
for
now
no
longer
shall
the
angel
of
the
lord
stand
watch
above
thy
gates
no
longer
shall
he
have
any
care
for
the
modesty
of
thy
virgins
or
the
courage
of
thy
men
or
for
the
fortunes
of
thy
merchants
o
city
of
gorcum
accursed
thou
art
and
doomed
to
misfortune
cursed
and
accursed
indeed
answered
ulenspiegel
as
accursed
as
is
the
comb
that
has
combed
away
the
lice
of
spain
or
accursed
as
the
dog
that
has
broken
the
chain
that
held
him
captive
or
as
the
proud
charger
that
has
thrown
from
his
back
the
cruel
cavalier
be
cursed
yourself
silly
preacher
that
you
are
who
think
it
an
evil
thing
to
break
the
rod
upon
the
back
of
a
tyrant
even
if
it
be
a
rod
of
iron
the
monk
was
silenced
and
dropping
his
eyes
he
seemed
lost
in
a
dream
of
hate
and
bigotry
the
next
morning
they
arrived
at
la
brièle
and
a
messenger
was
sent
to
advise
messire
de
lumey
of
their
coming
as
soon
as
he
had
received
the
news
he
set
out
to
go
to
them
on
horseback
half
dressed
as
he
was
and
with
him
went
a
company
of
armed
men
some
on
foot
and
some
on
horseback
and
now
once
again
was
it
given
to
ulenspiegel
to
behold
this
fierce
admiral
dressed
as
he
was
like
some
noble
proud
and
opulent
welcome
said
he
sir
monks
and
now
hold
up
your
hands
and
show
me
there
the
blood
of
my
lords
of
egmont
and
hoorn
one
of
the
monks
whose
name
was
leonard
made
answer
do
what
you
like
with
us
we
are
monks
no
one
will
make
any
objection
he
has
well
spoken
said
ulenspiegel
for
having
broken
with
the
world
that
is
with
father
mother
brother
and
sister
wife
and
sweetheart
a
monk
finds
no
one
at
the
hour
of
god
to
claim
anything
on
his
behalf
nevertheless
your
excellency
i
will
do
so
for
captain
marin
when
he
signed
the
treaty
for
the
capitulation
of
gorcum
stipulated
that
these
monks
should
be
free
like
all
the
others
that
were
taken
in
the
citadel
and
were
allowed
to
go
out
from
it
but
in
spite
of
this
and
for
no
adequate
reason
these
monks
were
kept
prisoner
and
now
it
is
reported
that
they
are
to
be
hanged
my
lord
i
address
myself
to
you
right
humbly
on
their
behalf
for
i
know
that
the
word
of
a
soldier
is
a
word
of
gold
parole
de
soldat
parole
and
who
are
you
asked
messire
de
lumey
my
lord
replied
ulenspiegel
a
fleming
i
am
from
the
lovely
land
of
flanders
working
man
nobleman
all
in
one
and
i
go
wandering
through
the
world
praising
things
beautiful
and
good
but
boldly
making
fun
of
foolishness
and
verily
i
will
sing
your
praises
if
you
will
keep
the
promise
which
was
made
to
these
men
by
the
captain
parole
de
soldat
parole
but
the
beggarmen
who
were
on
the
ship
cried
out
at
this
my
lord
said
they
this
man
is
a
traitor
he
has
promised
them
that
he
will
save
them
and
he
has
been
loading
them
with
bread
and
ham
and
sausages
but
to
us
he
has
given
nothing
at
all
then
messire
de
lumey
said
to
ulenspiegel
wandering
fleming
that
you
are
and
protector
of
monks
i
tell
you
i
will
have
you
hanged
with
them
i
am
not
afraid
replied
ulenspiegel
parole
de
soldat
parole
the
monks
were
led
away
to
a
barn
and
ulenspiegel
with
them
there
they
tried
to
convert
him
with
many
theological
arguments
but
these
soon
sent
him
to
sleep
in
the
meanwhile
messire
de
lumey
was
feasting
at
a
table
covered
with
meats
and
wines
when
a
messenger
arrived
from
gorcum
from
captain
marin
bringing
with
him
copies
of
those
letters
of
william
the
silent
prince
of
orange
which
ordered
all
governors
of
cities
and
other
places
to
confer
the
same
privileges
of
safety
and
surety
on
ecclesiastics
as
on
the
rest
of
the
people
the
messenger
asked
to
be
brought
into
the
presence
of
de
lumey
so
that
he
might
put
into
his
own
hands
the
copies
of
these
letters
where
are
the
originals
inquired
de
lumey
my
master
has
them
said
the
messenger
and
the
churl
sends
me
the
copy
said
de
lumey
where
is
your
passport
here
my
lord
said
the
messenger
then
messire
de
lumey
began
to
read
it
aloud
my
lord
and
master
marin
brandt
commands
all
ministers
governors
and
officers
of
the
republic
that
they
should
allow
to
pass
etc
de
lumey
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
and
tore
the
passport
in
two
sang
de
dieu
he
cried
what
is
he
doing
meddling
here
this
marin
this
trumpery
fellow
who
before
the
taking
of
la
brièle
had
not
so
much
as
the
bone
of
a
smoked
herring
to
place
between
his
teeth
he
calls
himself
lord
forsooth
and
and
sends
to
me
his
he
commands
and
orders
you
may
tell
your
master
that
since
he
is
so
much
of
a
captain
and
so
much
of
a
my
lord
ordering
and
commanding
so
excellently
well
the
monks
shall
be
hanged
forthwith
and
you
with
them
if
you
do
get
out
at
once
and
he
gave
the
man
a
great
kick
and
had
him
removed
from
the
room
bring
me
to
drink
he
cried
have
you
ever
seen
anything
to
compare
with
the
effrontery
of
this
marin
i
could
spit
my
food
out
so
angry
i
am
let
the
monks
be
hanged
immediately
and
let
the
wandering
fleming
be
brought
hither
to
me
as
soon
as
he
has
witnessed
the
execution
we
will
see
if
he
still
dares
to
tell
me
that
i
have
done
wrong
blood
of
god
what
are
these
pots
and
glasses
doing
here
and
with
a
great
noise
he
brake
the
bowls
and
dishes
and
no
one
durst
say
anything
to
him
the
servants
would
have
cleared
up
the
debris
but
he
would
not
allow
them
but
went
on
drinking
yet
more
and
growing
more
and
more
enraged
he
strode
up
and
down
the
room
treading
the
broken
pieces
and
stamping
upon
them
furiously
ulenspiegel
was
brought
before
him
well
he
said
what
news
of
your
friends
the
monks
they
have
been
hanged
said
ulenspiegel
and
those
cowards
of
executioners
whose
game
it
is
to
kill
for
profit
have
cut
one
of
them
open
to
sell
the
fat
to
an
apothecary
and
now
the
word
of
a
soldier
is
gold
no
more
parole

then
de
lumey
stamped
again
upon
the
broken
dishes
so
you
defy
me
do
you
you
beast
but
you
also
shall
be
hanged
not
in
my
barn
forsooth
but
in
the
open
street
most
ignominiously
where
all
can
see
you

be
punishing
those
rascals
that

fat

rushed
at
ulenspiegel
and
raised
his
hand
to

taken
him
by
the
arm
saying
have
mercy
he
is
a
brave
and
valiant
man
and
has
committed
no
crime
then
de

thought
better
of
the
matter
let
him
ask
my
pardon
then
he
said
but
ulenspiegel
stood
his
ground
never
he
said
at
least
he
must
admit
that
i
was
not
in
the
wrong
cried
de

growing
angry
again
ulenspiegel
answered
i
will
lick
no
man
boots
parole

tell
them
to
put
up
the

where
he
may
hear

ulenspiegel
and
i
will
cry
out
there
in
front
of
all
the
people
parole

the
gallows
was
set
up
in
the
market
square
and
the
news
spread
swiftly
through
the
city
how
ulenspiegel
the
brave
beggarman
was
going
to
be
hanged
and
the
populace
was
moved
with
pity
and
compassion
and
a
great
crowd
collected
in
the
market
square
and
messire
de
lumey
came
there
also
being
desirous
himself
to
give
the
signal
for
the
execution
he
regarded
ulenspiegel
without
pity
as
he
stood
upon
the
scaffold
dressed
to
meet
his
death
in
a
single
garment
with
his
arms
bound
to
his
sides
his
hands
clasped
together
the
cord
round
his
neck
and
the
executioner
ready
to
do
the
deed
said
my
lord
pardon
him
now
he
is
no
traitor
and
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
a
man
being
hanged
simply
because
he
was
sincere
and
pitiful
and
the
men
and
women
in
the
crowd
hearing
speak
in
this
wise
cried
out
also
have
pity
my
lord
mercy
and
pardon
for
ulenspiegel
the
has
defied
me
said

let
him
admit
he
was
wrong
and
that
i
was
in
the
right
will
you

ulenspiegel
answered
draw
the
cord
said
de

the
executioner
was
about
to
obey
when
a
young
maid
dressed
all
in
white
and
with
a
wreath
of
flowers
round
her
head
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
like
one
mad
and
threw
herself
on
the
neck
of
ulenspiegel
this
man
is
mine
she
said
i
take
him
for
my
husband
and
the
people
broke
into
applause
and
the
women
cried
aloud
long
live
the
maid
long
live
the
maid
that
has
saved
the
life
of
ulenspiegel
what
does
this
mean
demanded
messire
de

answered
you
must
know
that
by
the
legal
usages
and
customs
of
our
city
any
young
maid
or
unmarried
girl
has
the
right
to
save
a

provided
that
she
be
willing
to

him
for

said
de

unloose
his
fetters
then
riding
up
close
to
the
scaffold
he
saw
how
the
executioner
was
endeavouring
to
prevent
the
maid
from
severing
the
cords
which
bound
ulenspiegel
telling
her
at
the
same
time
that
he
did
know
who
would
pay
the
price
of
the
cords
if
she
cut
them
but
the
damsel
did
not
appear
even
to
hear
him
seeing
her
so
hasty
in
her
love
and
so
cunning
withal
the
heart
of
de
lumey
was
softened
within
him
and
he
asked
the
maid
who
she
might
be
i
am
nele
she
answered
him
the
betrothed
of
ulenspiegel
and
i
am
come
from
flanders
to
seek
him
you
have
done
well
said
de

in
a
disdainful
tone
and
he
went
away
then
approached
the
scaffold
young
fleming
he
said
when
once
you
are
married
will
you
still
serve
as
a

in
our
ships
yes

ulenspiegel
but
you
my

what
will
you
do

answered
if
you
will
allow
me
sir
i
am
fain

become
a
piper

well
said
and
he
gave
her
two
florins
for
the
wedding
feast
and
lamme
cried
for
joy
and
laughed
at
the
same
time
and
he
gave
her
three
other
florins
saying
we
will
eat
them
all
and
i
will
pay

us

they
repaired
to

where
a
great
feast
was
ordered
and
from
an
upper
window
lamme
threw
down
pennies
to
the
people
in
the
street
below
and
ulenspiegel
said
to
nele
sweetest
and
best
beloved
here

are
together
once
again
noel
for
she
is
here
flesh
heart
and
soul
of
my
sweet
love
oh
her
soft
eyes
and
her
red
and
lovely
lips
that
can
speak
naught
but
words
of
kindness
she
has
saved
my
life
my
tender
lover
and
now
it
you
and
only
you
that
shall
play
upon
our
ship
the
fife
of
deliverance

remember
but
no

is
our
hour
of
joy
and
all
for
me
is
now
this
face
sweet
as
june
flowers
i
am
in
paradise
but
why
tell
me
you
are
crying
they
have
killed
her
she
said
and
then
nele
told
him
all
the
sad
story
of
the
death
of
katheline
and
gazing
one
at
the
other
they
wept
for
love
and
for
sorrow
but
at
the
feast
they
ate
and
drank
and
lamme
as
he
looked
upon
them
grieved
within
himself
saying
alas
my
wife
where
are
you
and
the
priest
came
and
married
nele
and
ulenspiegel
and
the
morning
found
them
side
by
side
in
their
bed
of
marriage
and
nele
head
was
resting
on
the
shoulder
of
ulenspiegel
and
when
the
sun
had
awakened
her
he
said
fresh
face
soft
heart
we
two
will
be
the
avengers
of
the
land
of
flanders
she
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
saying
wild
head
strong
arms
god
bless
my
fife
and
your
sword
i
will
make
for
you
a
soldier
habit
said
ulenspiegel
now
at
once
at
once
he
told
her
but
who
was
that
man
who
said
that
strawberries
were
sweet
in
the
early
morning
your
lips
are
far
far
sweeter
xxxiii
by
sea
by
river
in
fair
weather
and
foul
through
snows
of
winter
and
summer
heat
the
ships
of
the
beggarmen
sailed
before
the
breeze
was
their
canvas
and
white
as
the
down
of
swans
white
swans
of
liberty
but
to
the
king
of
blood
came
the
news
of
their
conquests
and
death
was
already
at
work
upon
his
vitals
and
his
body
was
full
of
worms
and
he
dragged
himself
along
the
corridors
of
his
palace
at
valladolid
and
he
never
laughed
not
even
at
daybreak
what
time
the
sun
rose
to
irradiate
all
the
lands
of
his
empire
as
with
the
very
smile
of
god
but
ulenspiegel
lamme
and
nele
sang
out
like
birds
living
from
day
to
day
having
joy
to
hear
of
many
a
funeral
pyre
put
out
by
the
brave
beggarmen
and
tyl
sang
five
songs
all
to
the
glory
of
the
land
of
flanders
and
to
the
despite
of
her
enemies
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
a
day
having
taken
the
towns
of
rammeken
gertruydenberg
and
alckmaer
the
beggarmen
returned
to
flushing
and
there
in
the
harbour
they
beheld
a
little
boat
moored
and
in
the
boat
was
a
woman
with
hair
brown
eyes
fresh
cheeks
rounded
arms
and
white
hands
and
all
at
once
the
woman
cried
out
lamme
lamme
and
then
again
ah
but
you
must
not
approach
me
i
have
taken
a
vow
before
god
yet
i
love
you
ah
my
dear
husband
nele
said
it
is
calleken
huysbrechts
the
fair
calleken
even
so
answered
the
woman
but
alas
the
hour
of
noon
has
already
struck
for
my
beauty
and
she
looked
very
sorrowful
but
now
lamme
jumped
down
from
the
ship
into
a
little
skiff
which
was
straightway
brought
alongside
of
the
boat
wherein
was
his
wife
what
have
you
been
doing
he
asked
her
what
has
been
happening
to
you
why
did
you
leave
me
and
why
now
do
you
make
as
though
you
would
have
none
of
me
then
calleken
told
him
in
a
voice
that
oftentimes
trembled
with
tears
how
that
she
had
entrusted
the
care
of
her
soul
to
a
monk
one
brother
cornelis
adriaensen
and
how
he
had
warned
her
against
her
husband
for
that
he
was
a
heretic
and
a
consorter
with
heretics
how
also
by
his
eloquence
he
had
persuaded
her
that
a
life
of
celibacy
was
most
pleasing
unto
god
and
his
saints
albeit
he
oftentimes
profaned
the
holy
confessional
with
many
a
penance
that
was
most
distressful
to
her
modesty
nevertheless
she
ended
i
swear
before
god
that
i
remained
ever
faithful
to
you
my
husband
for
i
loved
you
but
lamme
gazed
upon
her
sadly
and
reproachfully
so
that
nele
said
to
him
if
calleken
has
been
faithful
as
she
says
it
behoves
her
now
to
leave
you
in
very
deed
as
a
punishment
for
your
unkindness
he
knows
not
how
i
love
him
said
calleken
is
this
the
truth
cried
lamme
and
then
seeing
that
it
was
so
then
come
wife
he
cried
the
winter
is
over
thereafter
having
given
and
received
from
all
the
kiss
of
peace
come
now
cried
lamme
come
wife
with
me
for
now
is
the
hour
of
lawful
loves
and
together
they
sailed
away
in
their
little
boat
meanwhile
the
soldiers
the
sailors
and
the
ship
boys
that
stood
around
all
waved
their
caps
in
the
air
and
shouted
adieu
brother
adieu
lamme
adieu
brother
brother
and
friend
and
nele
removed
with
the
tip
of
her
sweet
finger
a
tear
that
had
settled
in
the
corner
of
the
eye
of
ulenspiegel
you
are
sad
my
love
she
asked
him
he
was
good
tyl
said
nele
sighed
ah
this
war
will
it
never
end
must
we
live
for
ever
thus
in
the
midst
of
blood
and
tears
let
us
seek
the
seven
said
ulenspiegel
the
hour
of
deliverance
is
at
hand
xxxiv
it
was
the
season
of
harvest
the
air
was
heavy
the
wind
warm
they
that
gathered
the
harvest
were
able
now
to
reap
at
their
ease
under
a
free
sky
and
from
a
free
soil
the
corn
they
had
sown
frise
drenthe
overyssel
gueldre
utrecht
noord
brabant
noord
and
zuid
holland
walcheren
noord
and
zuid
beveland
duiveland
and
schouwen
which
together
make
up
zeeland
the
lands
to
the
north
from
knokke
to
helder
the
isles
of
texel
vlieland
ameland
and
schiermonik
oog
all
were
being
delivered
from
the
spanish
yoke
from
the
eastern
scheldt
to
the
oost
ems
and
maurice
the
son
of
william
the
silent
was
continuing
the
war
ulenspiegel
and
nele
kept
still
their
youthfulness
their
strength
and
their
beauty
for
the
love
and
the
spirit
of
flanders
never
grow
old
and
they
lived
happily
at
the
tower
of
neere
waiting
for
that
day
when
after
so
many
cruel
trials
they
would
be
able
to
breathe
the
breath
of
liberty
upon
their
native
land
of
belgium
ulenspiegel
had
asked
to
be
made
governor
and
guardian
of
the
tower
for
he
had
so
he
said
the
eyes
of
an
eagle
and
the
ears
of
a
hare
and
so
he
would
be
able
to
see
at
once
if
the
spaniard
ever
dared
to
show
himself
again
in
the
lands
that
had
been
delivered
from
his
yoke
then
quickly
would
he
sound
the
wacharm
the
as
we
call
it
in
our
tongue
to
this
request
the
magistrate
consented
and
in
virtue
of
the
good
service
he
had
rendered
ulenspiegel
was
allowed
a
florin
every
day
two
pints
of
beer
a
ration
of
beans
cheese
biscuits
and
three
pounds
of
beef
weekly
and
so
did
ulenspiegel
and
nele
live
on
the
tower
together
very
happily
having
joy
to
see
in
the
distance
the
free
isles
of
zeeland
and
near
at
hand
the
woods
and
castles
and
fortresses
and
the
armed
ships
of
the
beggarmen
that
guarded
the
coast
at
night
they
would
often
mount
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
there
they
would
sit
together
on
the
flat
roof
talking
of
many
a
stern
battle
and
telling
many
a
tale
of
love
past
and
to
come
and
from
their
tower
they
could
see
the
ocean
which
when
the
weather
was
hot
furled
and
unfurled
along
the
shore
its
shining
waves
and
threw
them
upon
the
like
wraiths
of
fire
and
among
the
polders
the
would
come
and
nele
was
afraid
of
them
for
she
said
they
were
the
souls
of
the
poor
dead
and
true
it
was
that
all
those
places
where
they
danced
had
once
been
fields
of
battle
and
the
would
oftentimes
spring
forth
from
the
polders
and
run
along
the
dikes
and
then
return
again
to
the
polders
as
though
unwilling
to
leave
the
bodies
whence
they
had
come
one
night
nele
said
to
ulenspiegel
behold
how
many
spirits
there
are
in
dreiveland
and
how
high
they
fly
over
there
by
the
isle
of
birds
they
seem
to
crowd
the
thickest
will
you
come
with
me
there
one
night
tyl
we
would
take
with
us
the
balm
that
can
show
us
things
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
but
ulenspiegel
answered
if
you
mean
the
balm
we
took
when
we
went
to
the
great
sabbath
of
spring
i
have
no
more
faith
or
confidence
in
what
we
saw
there
than
in
any
idle
dream
it
is
wrong
to
deny
the
power
of
charms
said
nele
come
ulenspiegel
very
well
he
said
the
next
day
ulenspiegel
arranged
with
the
magistrate
that
one
of
the
soldiers
who
had
clear
sight
and
a
faithful
heart
should
take
his
place
at
the
tower
for
that
one
evening
and
away
he
went
with
nele
towards
the
isle
of
birds
they
passed
along
by
many
a
field
and
dike
till
at
last
they
saw
the
sea
in
front
of
them
and
in
it
were
set
many
little
green
islands
with
the
waves
coursing
in
between
and
all
about
the
grassy
hills
which
soon
began
to
lose
themselves
in
the
a
great
quantity
of
peewits
were
flying
high
and
low
and
and
some
of
these
birds
would
crowd
together
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
stay
there
quite
still
so
that
they
looked
like
little
white
islets
and
above
them
and
about
flew
thousands
of
their
fellows
the
very
soil
itself
was
full
of
their
nests
and
ulenspiegel
stooped
down
to
pick
up
one
of
their
eggs
which
was
lying
on
the
road
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
a
came
flapping
towards
him
crying
out
the
while
most
dolefully
and
in
answer
to
this
summons
there
flew
up
a
hundred
other
crying
out
as
if
in
anguish
hovering
about
the
head
of
ulenspiegel
and
over
the
neighbouring
nests
but
they
did
not
dare
to
approach
him
ulenspiegel
said
nele
these
birds
are
asking
you
to
have
mercy
on
their
eggs
then
she
began
to
tremble
and
said
i
am
afraid
behold
the
sun
is
setting
the
sky
is
pale
the
stars
are
awakening
it
is
the
hour
of
the
spirits
and
look
at
these
ruddy
exhalations
which
rise
all
about
us
and
seem
as
it
were
to
trail
along
the
ground
tyl
my
beloved
what
monster
from
hell
may
he
be
who
thus
in
the
mist
begins
to
open
his
fiery
mouth
and
look
over
there
towards
philipsland
it
was
there
that
the
murderer
king
had
all
those
poor
men
done
to
death
not
once
but
twice
and
all
for
the
sake
of
his
cruel
ambition
and
there
this
night
the
are
dancing
for
this
is
the
night
when
the
souls
of
poor
men
killed
in
battle
leave
their
bodies
all
cold
in
purgatory
and
come
to
warm
themselves
once
again
in
the
tepid
air
of
earth
this
is
the
hour
when
you
may
ask
anything
you
will
of
christ
he
who
is
lord
of
all
good
wizards
the
ashes
beat
upon
my
heart
said
ulenspiegel
would
that
he
would
show
me
those
seven
whose
ashes
they
say
when
thrown
to
the
winds
would
make
flanders
happy
again
and
all
the
world
o
man
without
faith
said
nele
by
the
power
of
the
balm
it
may
be
you
will
see
them
maybe
said
ulenspiegel
if
some
spirit
forsooth
would
come
down
to
visit
us
from
that
cold
star
and
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
star
sirius
no
sooner
had
he
made
this
gesture
than
a
that
had
been
flying
round
them
came
and
attached
itself
to
his
finger
and
the
more
ulenspiegel
tried
to
shake
it
off
the
firmer
the
little
wisp
held
on
nele
tried
to
free
ulenspiegel
but
now
she
also
had
a
little
wisp
firm
on
the
tip
of
her
finger
and
neither
would
it
let
her
go
ulenspiegel
began
to
flick
at
the
wisp
with
his
free
hand
saying
answer
me
now
are
you
the
soul
of
a
beggarman
or
of
a
spaniard
if
you
are
a
beggarman
you
may
go
to
paradise
but
if
a
spaniard
return
to
the
hell
whence
you
came
nele
said
to
him
do
not
abuse
the
souls
of
the
dead
even
though
they
be
the
souls
of
murderers
then
making
the
little
to
dance
at
the
end
of
her
finger
wisp
she
said
gentle
wisp
come
tell
me
what
news
do
you
bring
from
the
land
of
souls
what
rule
do
they
live
by
down
there
do
they
eat
and
drink
having
no
mouths
for
you
have
none
my
sweet
or
wait
they
perhaps
till
they
come
to
blessed
paradise
ere
taking
upon
themselves
a
human
form
why
waste
time
in
talking
to
a
peevish
little
flame
that
has
no
ears
to
hear
with
no
mouth
wherewith
to
answer
said
ulenspiegel
but
paying
no
attention
to
him
nele
went
on
wisp
of
mine
answer
me
now
by
dancing
for
i
am
going
to
question
you
thrice
once
in
the
name
of
god
once
in
the
name
of
our
lady
and
once
in
the
name
of
the
elemental
spirits
who
are
the
messengers
between
god
and
men
and
this
she
did
and
three
times
did
the
elf
dance
in
answer
then
nele
said
to
ulenspiegel
take
off
your
clothes
and
i
will
do
the
same
see
here
is
the
silver
box
which
holds
the
balm
of
vision
be
it
as
you
wish
answered
ulenspiegel
when
they
had
undressed
and
anointed
themselves
with
the
balm
of
vision
they
lay
down
naked
as
they
were
beside
one
another
on
the
grass
the
screamed
the
thunder
growled
and
rumbled
and
in
the
darkness
the
lightning
flashed
between
two
clouds
the
moon
scarcely
showed
her
crescent
golden
horns
and
the
departed
from
nele
and
ulenspiegel
to
go
off
dancing
with
their
comrades
in
the
fields
suddenly
a
great
giant
hand
took
hold
of
nele
and
her
lover
and
threw
them
high
in
air
as
though
they
had
been
a
child
playthings
then
the
giant
caught
them
again
rolled
them
one
on
the
other
and
kneaded
them
between
his
hands
and
after
that
he
threw
them
into
a
pool
of
water
that
lay
between
the
hills
and
last
of
all
he
dragged
them
out
again
full
of
water
and
and
the
giant
began
to
sing
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
all
the
of
the
islands
awakened
in
terror
with
eyes
that
squint
they
would
discern
these
silly
wandering
the
sacred
symbols
none
may
learn
safe
guarded
now
within
our
portals
read
then
flea
the
mystery
high
read
then
louse
the
secret
vast
which
to
earth
and
air
and
sky
by
seven
nails
is
anchored
fast
and
now
it
was
that
ulenspiegel
and
nele
discerned
on
the
grass
and
in
the
air
and
in
the
sky
seven
tablets
of
bronze
all
strangely
luminous
and
they
were
held
there
by
seven
flaming
nails
and
on
the
tablets
was
written
from
the
flowers
arise
seven
are
wicked
but
seven
are
good
hid
in
coal
the
diamond
lies
bad
teacher
oft
makes
pupil
wise
seven
are
bad
but
seven
are
good
and
the
giant
walked
on
followed
by
all
the
who
were
whispering
together
like
grasshoppers
and
saying
look
at
him
well
the
master
of
all
before
him
cæsar
himself
must
fall
pope
of
popes
king
of
kings
fashioned
of
wood
he
is
lord
of
all
things
suddenly
the
lines
of
the
giant
face
suffered
a
change
he
seemed
thinner
sadder
and
greater
than
ever
and
in
one
hand
he
held
a
sceptre
and
in
the
other
a
sword
and
his
name
was
pride
and
throwing
nele
and
ulenspiegel
to
the
ground
he
said
i
am
god
then
by
his
side
there
appeared
a
girl
and
she
was
seated
on
the
back
of
a
goat
and
her
bosom
was
bare
her
gown
half
open
and
she
had
a
wanton
eye
and
her
name
was
luxury
after
her
there
came
an
old
woman
a
jewess
who
was
busy
all
the
time
scraping
up
the
of
the
that
lay
about
on
the
ground
and
her
name
was
avarice
then
a
monk
appeared
most
greedy
and
gluttonous
eating
chitterlings
he
was
and
cramming
himself
with
sausages
and
champing
his
jaws
together
without
ceasing
like
the
sow
whereon
he
rode
and
his
name
was
greed
thereafter
came
idleness
dragging
one
leg
after
the
other
wan
she
was
and
bloated
and
she
had
a
dull
eye
and
anger
came
chasing
after
idleness
with
a
sharp
needle
with
which
she
pricked
her
so
that
she
cried
aloud
and
idleness
grieved
and
lamented
with
many
tears
and
kept
falling
down
on
to
her
knees
so
tired
she
was
last
of
all
came
envy
a
thin
figure
with
a
head
like
a
viper
and
teeth
like
the
teeth
of
a
pike
and
she
kept
biting
all
the
others
with
those
cruel
teeth
of
hers
idleness
because
she
had
too
much
leisure
anger
because
she
was
too
lively
greed
because
he
was
too
well
fed
luxury
because
she
was
too
ruddy
avarice
because
of
the
treasure
of
shells
she
had
amassed
pride
because
of
his
robe
of
purple
and
his
crown
and
the
wisps
kept
dancing
all
around
and
they
spake
with
many
voices
like
the
voices
of
men
women
and
girls
and
in
the
plaintive
voices
of
children
and
they
groaned
saying
o
pride
father
of
ambition
and
you
o
anger
that
are
the
source
of
cruelty
you
slew
us
on
many
a
battlefield
and
caused
our
death
in
many
a
prison
and
many
a
that
you
might
keep
your
sceptres
and
your
crowns
and
you
o
envy
that
have
destroyed
so
many
useful
thoughts
while
yet
in
the
germ
we
are
the
souls
of
the
inventors
whom
you
have
persecuted
avarice
you
it
is
that
have
turned
the
blood
of
the
poor
into
gold
and
we
are
the
souls
of
your
victims
o
luxury
you
are
the
friend
and
the
sister
of
murder
nero
messalina
philip
king
of
spain
such
are
your
children
and
you
buy
virtue
and
you
bribe
corruption
and
we
are
the
souls
of
your
dead
and
you
o
idleness
and
you
greed
you
befoul
the
world
but
the
world
must
be
cleansed
of
you
we
are
the
souls
of
those
who
have
perished
at
your
hands
and
a
voice
was
heard
saying
from
the
flowers
arise
seven
are
wicked
but
seven
are
good
bad
teacher
oft
makes
pupil
wise
now
longs
the
wandering
louse
comprise
both
coal
and
cinder
if
he
could
then
spake
the
wisps
fire
we
are
fire
the
avenger
of
all
old
tears
and
all
old
pains
which
the
people
have
suffered
the
avenger
of
all
the
human
game
that
has
been
hunted
for
pleasure
by
the
lords
of
this
land
the
avenger
of
all
battles
fought
to
no
purpose
of
all
the
blood
that
has
been
spilt
in
prison
of
all
the
men
burned
at
the
stake
and
the
women
and
girls
buried
alive
the
avenger
of
all
the
past
of
blood
and
chains
the
fire
that
is
us
we
are
the
souls
of
the
dead
at
these
words
the
seven
were
suddenly
transformed
into
images
of
wood
though
they
still
lost
nothing
of
their
former
outline
and
a
voice
was
heard
saying
burn
the
wood
ulenspiegel
and
ulenspiegel
turned
towards
the
you
that
are
made
of
fire
do
your
office
and
the
wisps
thronged
around
the
seven
images
which
straightway
burst
into
flame
and
were
reduced
to
ashes
and
from
the
ashes
there
flowed
a
river
of
blood
but
out
of
the
ashes
arose
now
seven
other
figures
and
the
first
said
once
i
was
called
pride
but
now
my
name
is
nobility
and
the
rest
spake
after
the
same
fashion
and
nele
and
ulenspiegel
saw
how
economy
came
forth
from
avarice
vivacity
from
anger
healthy
appetite
from
gluttony
emulation
from
envy
and
from
idleness
the
dreams
of
poets
and
wise
men
and
luxury
on
her
goat
was
now
transformed
into
the
likeness
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
her
name
was
love
and
all
around
them
danced
the
most
joyously
and
thereafter
did
ulenspiegel
and
nele
begin
to
hear
a
thousand
voices
as
of
hidden
men
and
women
that
spake
with
a
sonorous
clicking
sound
like
that
of
castanets
and
thus
sang
they
when
over
the
earth
and
over
the
sea
these
seven
transformed
shall
reign
mortals
lift
up
your
heads
again
for
happy
the
world
shall
be
and
ulenspiegel
said
these
spirits
are
making
mock
of
us
and
a
powerful
hand
seized
nele
by
the
arm
and
threw
her
away
into
the
void
and
the
spirits
sang
when
the
north
shall
kiss
the
west
then
shall
be
the
end
of
ruin
find
the
cincture
alas
cried
ulenspiegel
north
west
cincture
you
speak
in
riddles
sir
spirits
but
they
went
on
with
their
singing
and
chattering
the
north
is
the
netherland
belgium
is
the
west
cincture
is
friendship
cincture
is
alliance
now
you
are
talking
sense
sir
spirits
said
ulenspiegel
and
yet
again
they
sang
the
cincture
little
man
holland
and
belgium
firm
alliance
and
beautiful
friendship
alliance
of
counsel
alliance
of
action
by
death
by
blood
were
it
not
for
the
scheldt
little
man
for
the
scheldt
alas
said
ulenspiegel
such
is
our
life
tears
of
man
and
laughter
of
destiny
and
again
the
spirits
repeated
their
rune
and
their
voices
were
like
the
clicking
of
castanets
alliance
by
blood
and
by
death
were
it
not
for
the
scheldt
and
a
strong
hand
took
hold
of
ulenspiegel
and
threw
him
into
the
void
xxxv
as
she
fell
nele
rubbed
her
eyes
but
she
could
see
nothing
save
the
sun
that
was
rising
wreathed
in
a
golden
mist
and
then
the
tips
of
the
grass
all
golden
too
in
that
radiance
which
was
soon
to
tinge
with
gold
the
plumage
of
the
who
slept
as
yet
but
were
about
to
awaken
nele
looked
downwards
at
herself
and
seeing
that
she
was
naked
she
put
on
her
clothes
with
all
haste
then
it
was
that
she
noticed
the
body
of
ulenspiegel
where
it
lay
there
naked
also
and
him
also
she
covered
with
his
clothes
he
seemed
to
be
still
asleep
and
she
gave
him
a
shake
but
he
remained
quite
motionless
like
one
dead
then
was
nele
seized
with
fear
have
i
killed
him
she
cried
have
i
killed
my
love
with
this
balm
of
vision
would
that
i
too
might
die
ah
tyl
wake
up
but
he
is
as
cold
as
marble
ulenspiegel
did
not
awake
and
two
nights
passed
and
a
day
and
nele
still
watched
by
his
side
in
a
fever
of
grief
and
fear
it
was
at
the
dawn
of
the
second
day
of
her
vigil
that
nele
heard
the
sound
of
a
little
bell
in
the
distance
and
saw
presently
a
peasant
approaching
with
a
shovel
in
his
hand
behind
him
came
a
burgomaster
with
two
aldermen
carrying
candles
and
then
the
curé
of
stavenisse
with
a
beadle
holding
a
parasol
over
his
head
it
appeared
that
they
were
going
to
administer
the
holy
sacrament
of
unction
to
one
jacobsen
a
brave
beggarman
who
had
adopted
the
new
religion
by
compulsion
but
being
about
to
die
had
returned
to
the
bosom
of
the
holy
roman
church
when
they
came
opposite
to
nele
they
found
her
still
crying
and
they
saw
the
body
of
ulenspiegel
laid
out
on
the
grass
in
front
of
her
covered
with
clothes
nele
fell
upon
her
knees
in
front
of
the
little
procession
my
girl
said
the
burgomaster
what
are
you
doing
by
this
corpse
without
daring
to
raise
her
eyes
nele
made
answer
i
am
praying
for
the
soul
of
my
beloved
he
that
has
fallen
dead
as
if
struck
by
lightning
i
am
alone
now
and
i
am
fain
to
die
but
already
the
curé
was
puffing
with
pleasure
ulenspiegel
the
beggarman
dead
he
cried
praise
be
to
god
be
quick
there
peasant
and
dig
a
grave
and
take
his
clothes
off
before
you
bury
him
no
said
nele
getting
up
from
the
ground
no
you
shall
not
take
his
clothes
he
would
be
cold
there
in
the
cold
earth
quick
cried
the
curé
addressing
himself
again
to
the
peasant
with
the
shovel
you
may
bury
him
said
nele
all
in
tears
i
give
you
leave
for
this
sand
is
full
of
lime
so
that
his
body
will
keep
for
ever
whole
and
beautiful
the
body
of
my
beloved
and
half
mad
with
anguish
as
she
was
nele
bent
over
the
body
of
ulenspiegel
kissing
him
through
her
tears
now
the
burgomaster
the
aldermen
and
even
the
peasant
had
compassion
on
the
girl
but
not
so
the
curé
who
ceased
not
to
cry
out
most
joyfully
the
great
beggarman
is
dead
god
be
praised
then
the
peasant
dug
the
grave
and
ulenspiegel
was
placed
therein
and
covered
all
over
with
sand
and
over
the
grave
the
curé
said
the
prayers
for
the
dead
and
the
others
knelt
all
round
suddenly
there
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
sand
and
ulenspiegel
arose
sneezing
and
shaking
the
sand
from
his
hair
and
he
seized
the
curé
by
the
throat
inquisitor
he
cried
i
was
asleep
and
you
buried
me
alive
where
is
nele
have
you
buried
her
also
who
are
you
the
curé
began
to
cry
out
in
terror
the
great
beggarman
returns
to
this
world
lord
god
have
mercy
on
my
soul
and
away
he
fled
like
a
stag
before
the
hounds
nele
came
to
ulenspiegel
kiss
me
dearest
she
said
then
ulenspiegel
looked
about
him
once
more
the
two
peasants
had
run
off
like
the
curé
and
that
they
might
run
the
faster
they
had
thrown
to
the
ground
both
shovel
and
parasol
as
for
the
burgomaster
and
the
aldermen
they
lay
groaning
on
the
grass
stopping
up
their
ears
in
their
fright
ulenspiegel
went
to
them
and
gave
them
a
good
shaking
think
you
that
they
can
be
buried
in
the
ground
he
asked
them
ulenspiegel
and
nele
nele
that
is
the
heart
of
our
mother
flanders
and
ulenspiegel
that
is
her
soul
she
can
sleep
too
forsooth
but
die
never
come
nele
and
they
twain
departed
ulenspiegel
singing
his
sixth
song
but
no
man
knoweth
where
he
sang
his
last
note
the
author
debt
to
such
sources
is
especially
noticeable
in
