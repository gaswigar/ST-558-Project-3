preface
every
preface
is
i
imagine
written
after
the
book
has
been
completed
and
now
that
i
have
finished
this
volume
i
will
state
several
difficulties
which
may
put
the
reader
upon
his
guard
unless
he
too
postpones
the
preface
to
the
very
last
many
times
during
the
writing
of
these
reminiscences
i
have
become
convinced
that
the
task
was
undertaken
all
too
soon
one
fiftieth
year
is
indeed
an
impressive
milestone
at
which
one
may
well
pause
to
take
an
accounting
but
the
people
with
whom
i
have
so
long
journeyed
have
become
so
intimate
a
part
of
my
lot
that
they
can
not
be
written
of
either
in
praise
or
blame
the
public
movements
and
causes
with
which
i
am
still
identified
have
become
so
endeared
some
of
them
through
their
very
struggles
and
failures
that
it
is
difficult
to
discuss
them
it
has
also
been
hard
to
determine
what
incidents
and
experiences
should
be
selected
for
recital
and
i
have
found
that
i
might
give
an
accurate
report
of
each
isolated
event
and
yet
give
a
totally
misleading
impression
of
the
whole
solely
by
the
selection
of
the
incidents
for
these
reasons
and
many
others
i
have
found
it
difficult
to
make
a
page
viii
faithful
record
of
the
years
since
the
autumn
of
when
without
any
preconceived
social
theories
or
economic
views
i
came
to
live
in
an
industrial
district
of
chicago
if
the
reader
should
inquire
why
the
book
was
ever
undertaken
in
the
face
of
so
many
difficulties
in
reply
i
could
instance
two
purposes
only
one
of
which
in
the
language
of
organized
charity
is
worthy
because
settlements
have
multiplied
so
easily
in
the
united
states
i
hoped
that
a
simple
statement
of
an
earlier
effort
including
the
stress
and
storm
might
be
of
value
in
their
interpretation
and
possibly
clear
them
of
a
certain
charge
of
superficiality
the
unworthy
motive
was
a
desire
to
start
a
backfire
as
it
were
to
extinquish
two
biographies
of
myself
one
of
which
had
been
submitted
to
me
in
outline
that
made
life
in
a
settlement
all
too
smooth
and
charming
the
earlier
chapters
present
influences
and
personal
motives
with
a
detail
which
will
be
quite
unpardonable
if
they
fail
to
make
clear
the
personality
upon
whom
various
social
and
industrial
movements
in
chicago
reacted
during
a
period
of
twenty
years
no
effort
is
made
in
the
recital
to
separate
my
own
history
from
that
of
during
the
years
in
which
i
was
launched
deep
into
the
stormy
intercourse
of
human
life
for
so
far
as
a
mind
is
pliant
under
the
pressure
of
events
and
experiences
it
becomes
hard
to
detach
it
it
has
unfortunately
been
necessary
to
abandon
page
ix
the
chronological
order
in
favor
of
the
topical
for
during
the
early
years
at
time
seemed
to
afford
a
mere
framework
for
certain
lines
of
activity
and
i
have
found
in
writing
this
book
that
after
these
activities
have
been
recorded
i
can
scarcely
recall
the
scaffolding
more
than
a
third
of
the
material
in
the
book
has
appeared
in
the
american
magazine
one
chapter
of
it
in
mcclure
magazine
and
earlier
statements
of
the
settlement
motive
published
years
ago
have
been
utilized
in
chronological
order
because
it
seemed
impossible
to
reproduce
their
enthusiasm
it
is
a
matter
of
gratification
to
me
that
the
book
is
illustrated
from
drawings
made
by
miss
norah
hamilton
of
and
the
cover
designed
by
another
resident
frank
hazenplug
i
am
indebted
for
the
making
of
the
index
and
for
many
other
services
to
miss
clara
landsberg
also
of
if
the
conclusions
of
the
whole
matter
are
similar
to
those
i
have
already
published
at
intervals
during
the
twenty
years
at
i
can
only
make
the
defense
that
each
of
the
earlier
books
was
an
attempt
to
set
forth
a
thesis
supported
by
experience
whereas
this
volume
endeavors
to
trace
the
experiences
through
which
various
conclusions
were
forced

twenty

chapter
i
earliest
impressions
on
the
theory
that
our
genuine
impulses
may
be
connected
with
our
childish
experiences
that
one
bent
may
be
tracked
back
to
that
land
where
character
is
formless
but
nevertheless
settling
into
definite
lines
of
future
development
i
begin
this
record
with
some
impressions
of
my
childhood
all
of
these
are
directly
connected
with
my
father
although
of
course
i
recall
many
experiences
apart
from
him
i
was
one
of
the
younger
members
of
a
large
family
and
an
eager
participant
in
the
village
life
but
because
my
father
was
so
distinctly
the
dominant
influence
and
because
it
is
quite
impossible
to
set
forth
all
of
one
early
impressions
it
has
seemed
simpler
to
string
these
first
memories
on
that
single
cord
moreover
it
was
this
cord
which
not
only
held
fast
my
supreme
affections
but
also
first
drew
me
into
the
moral
concerns
of
life
and
later
afforded
a
clew
there
to
which
i
somewhat
wistfully
clung
in
the
intricacy
of
its
mazes
it
must
have
been
from
a
very
early
period
that
i
recall
horrid
nights
when
i
tossed
about
in
my
bed
because
i
had
told
a
lie
i
was
held
in
the
grip
of
a
miserable
dread
of
death
a
double
fear
first
that
i
myself
should
die
in
my
sins
and
go
straight
to
that
fiery
hell
which
was
never
mentioned
at
home
but
which
i
had
heard
all
about
from
other
children
and
second
that
my
father
representing
the
entire
adult
world
which
i
had
basely
deceived
should
himself
die
before
i
had
time
to
tell
him
my
only
method
of
obtaining
relief
was
to
go
downstairs
to
my
father
room
and
make
full
confession
the
high
resolve
to
do
this
would
push
me
out
of
bed
and
carry
me
down
the
stairs
without
a
touch
of
fear
but
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
would
be
faced
by
the
awful
necessity
of
passing
the
front
door
which
my
father
because
of
his
quaker
tendencies
did
not
lock
and
of
crossing
the
wide
and
black
expanse
of
the
living
room
in
order
to
reach
his
door
i
would
invariably
cling
to
the
newel
post
while
i
contemplated
the
perils
of
the
situation
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
literal
first
step
meant
putting
my
bare
foot
upon
a
piece
of
oilcloth
in
front
of
the
door
only
a
few
inches
wide
but
lying
straight
in
my
path
i
would
finally
reach
my
father
bedside
perfectly
breathless
and
having
panted
out
the
history
of
my
sin
invariable
received
the
same
assurance
that
if
he
had
a
little
girl
who
told
lies
he
was
very
glad
that
she
felt
too
bad
to
go
to
sleep
afterward
no
absolution
was
asked
for
or
received
but
apparently
the
sense
that
the
knowledge
of
my
wickedness
was
shared
or
an
obscure
understanding
of
the
affection
which
underlay
the
grave
statement
was
sufficient
for
i
always
went
back
to
bed
as
bold
as
a
lion
and
slept
if
not
the
sleep
of
the
just
at
least
that
of
the
comforted
i
recall
an
incident
which
must
have
occurred
before
i
was
seven
years
old
for
the
mill
in
which
my
father
transacted
his
business
that
day
was
closed
in
the
mill
stood
in
the
neighboring
town
adjacent
to
its
poorest
quarter
before
then
i
had
always
seen
the
little
city
of
ten
thousand
people
with
the
admiring
eyes
of
a
country
child
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
all
its
streets
were
not
as
bewilderingly
attractive
as
the
one
which
contained
the
glittering
toyshop
and
the
confectioner
on
that
day
i
had
my
first
sight
of
the
poverty
which
implies
squalor
and
felt
the
curious
distinction
between
the
ruddy
poverty
of
the
country
and
that
which
even
a
small
city
presents
in
its
shabbiest
streets
i
remember
launching
at
my
father
the
pertinent
inquiry
why
people
lived
in
such
horrid
little
houses
so
close
together
and
that
after
receiving
his
explanation
i
declared
with
much
firmness
when
i
grew
up
i
should
of
course
have
a
large
house
but
it
would
not
be
built
among
the
other
large
houses
but
right
in
the
midst
of
horrid
little
houses
like
those
that
curious
sense
of
responsibility
for
carrying
on
the
affairs
which
little
children
often
exhibit
because
the
old
man
clogs
our
earliest
years
i
remember
in
myself
in
a
very
absurd
manifestation
i
dreamed
night
after
night
that
every
one
in
the
world
was
dead
excepting
myself
and
that
upon
me
rested
the
responsibility
of
making
a
wagon
wheel
the
village
street
remained
as
usual
the
village
blacksmith
shop
was
all
there
even
a
glowing
fire
upon
the
forge
and
the
anvil
in
its
customary
place
near
the
door
but
no
human
being
was
within
sight
they
had
all
gone
around
the
edge
of
the
hill
to
the
village
cemetery
and
i
alone
remained
alive
in
the
deserted
world
i
always
stood
in
the
same
spot
in
the
blacksmith
shop
darkly
pondering
as
to
how
to
begin
and
never
once
did
i
know
how
although
i
fully
realized
that
the
affairs
of
the
world
could
not
be
resumed
until
at
least
one
wheel
should
be
made
and
something
started
every
victim
of
nightmare
is
i
imagine
overwhelmed
by
an
excessive
sense
of
responsibility
and
the
consciousness
of
a
fearful
handicap
in
the
effort
to
perform
what
is
required
but
perhaps
never
were
the
odds
more
heavily
against
a
warder
of
the
world
than
in
these
reiterated
dreams
of
mine
doubtless
compounded
in
equal
parts
of
a
childish
version
of
robinson
crusoe
and
of
the
predictions
of
the
second
adventists
a
few
of
whom
were
found
in
the
village
the
next
morning
would
often
find
me
a
delicate
little
girl
of
six
with
the
further
disability
of
a
curved
spine
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
village
blacksmith
shop
anxiously
watching
the
burly
figure
at
work
i
would
store
my
mind
with
such
details
of
the
process
of
making
wheels
as
i
could
observe
and
sometimes
i
plucked
up
courage
to
ask
for
more
do
you
always
have
to
sizzle
the
iron
in
water
i
would
ask
thinking
how
horrid
it
would
be
to
do
sure
the
blacksmith
would
reply
that
makes
the
iron
hard
i
would
sigh
heavily
and
walk
away
bearing
my
responsibility
as
best
i
could
and
this
of
course
i
confided
to
no
one
for
there
is
something
too
mysterious
in
the
burden
of
the
winds
that
come
from
the
fields
of
sleep
to
be
communicated
although
it
is
at
the
same
time
too
heavy
a
burden
to
be
borne
alone
my
great
veneration
and
pride
in
my
father
manifested
itself
in
curious
ways
on
several
sundays
doubtless
occurring
in
two
or
three
different
years
the
union
sunday
school
of
the
village
was
visited
by
strangers
some
of
those
strange
people
who
live
outside
a
child
realm
yet
constantly
thrill
it
by
their
close
approach
my
father
taught
the
large
bible
class
in
the
lefthand
corner
of
the
church
next
to
the
pulpit
and
to
my
eyes
at
least
was
a
most
imposing
figure
in
his
sunday
frock
coat
his
fine
head
rising
high
above
all
the
others
i
imagined
that
the
strangers
were
filled
with
admiration
for
this
dignified
person
and
i
prayed
with
all
my
heart
that
the
ugly
little
girl
whose
crooked
back
obliged
her
to
walk
with
her
head
held
very
much
upon
one
side
would
never
be
pointed
out
to
these
visitors
as
the
daughter
of
this
fine
man
in
order
to
lessen
the
possibility
of
a
connection
being
made
on
these
particular
sundays
i
did
not
walk
beside
my
father
although
this
walk
was
the
great
event
of
the
week
but
attached
myself
firmly
to
the
side
of
my
uncle
james
addams
in
the
hope
that
i
should
be
mistaken
for
his
child
or
at
least
that
i
should
not
remain
so
conspicuously
unattached
that
troublesome
questions
might
identify
an
ugly
duckling
with
her
imposing
parent
my
uncle
who
had
many
children
of
his
own
must
have
been
mildly
surprised
at
this
unwonted
attention
but
he
would
look
down
kindly
at
me
and
say
so
you
are
going
to
walk
with
me
yes
please
uncle
james
would
be
my
meek
reply
he
fortunately
never
explored
my
motives
nor
do
i
remember
that
my
father
ever
did
so
that
in
all
probability
my
machinations
have
been
safe
from
public
knowledge
until
this
hour
it
is
hard
to
account
for
the
manifestations
of
a
child
adoring
affection
so
emotional
so
irrational
so
tangled
with
the
affairs
of
the
imagination
i
simply
could
not
endure
the
thought
that
strange
people
should
know
that
my
handsome
father
owned
this
homely
little
girl
but
even
in
my
chivalric
desire
to
protect
him
from
his
fate
i
was
not
quite
easy
in
the
sacrifice
of
my
uncle
although
i
quieted
my
scruples
with
the
reflection
that
the
contrast
was
less
marked
and
that
anyway
his
own
little
girl
was
not
so
very
pretty
i
do
not
know
that
i
commonly
dwelt
much
upon
my
personal
appearance
save
as
it
thrust
itself
as
an
incongruity
into
my
father
life
and
in
spite
of
unending
evidence
to
the
contrary
there
were
even
black
moments
when
i
allowed
myself
to
speculate
as
to
whether
he
might
not
share
the
feeling
happily
however
this
specter
was
laid
before
it
had
time
to
grow
into
a
morbid
familiar
by
a
very
trifling
incident
one
day
i
met
my
father
coming
out
of
his
bank
on
the
main
street
of
the
neighboring
city
which
seemed
to
me
a
veritable
whirlpool
of
society
and
commerce
with
a
playful
touch
of
exaggeration
he
lifted
his
high
and
shining
silk
hat
and
made
me
an
imposing
bow
this
distinguished
public
recognition
this
totally
unnecessary
identification
among
a
mass
of
strange
people
who
could
possibly
know
unless
he
himself
made
the
sign
suddenly
filled
me
with
a
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
the
entire
feeling
it
may
not
even
then
have
seemed
as
absurd
as
it
really
was
but
at
least
it
seemed
enough
so
to
collapse
or
to
pass
into
the
limbo
of
forgotten
specters
i
made
still
other
almost
equally
grotesque
attempts
to
express
this
doglike
affection
the
house
at
the
end
of
the
village
in
which
i
was
born
and
which
was
my
home
until
i
moved
to
in
my
earliest
childhood
had
opposite
to
it
only
across
the
road
and
then
across
a
little
stretch
of
greensward
two
mills
belonging
to
my
father
one
flour
mill
to
which
the
various
grains
were
brought
by
the
neighboring
farmers
and
one
sawmill
in
which
the
logs
of
the
native
timber
were
sawed
into
lumber
the
latter
offered
the
great
excitement
of
sitting
on
a
log
while
it
slowly
approached
the
buzzing
saw
which
was
cutting
it
into
slabs
and
of
getting
off
just
in
time
to
escape
a
sudden
and
gory
death
but
the
flouring
mill
was
much
more
beloved
it
was
full
of
dusky
floury
places
which
we
adored
of
empty
bins
in
which
we
might
play
house
it
had
a
basement
with
piles
of
bran
and
shorts
which
were
almost
as
good
as
sand
to
play
in
whenever
the
miller
let
us
wet
the
edges
of
the
pile
with
water
brought
in
his
sprinkling
pot
from
the
in
addition
to
these
fascinations
was
the
association
of
the
mill
with
my
father
activities
for
doubtless
at
that
time
i
centered
upon
him
all
that
careful
imitation
which
a
little
girl
ordinarily
gives
to
her
mother
ways
and
habits
my
mother
had
died
when
i
was
a
baby
and
my
father
second
marriage
did
not
occur
until
my
eighth
year
i
had
a
consuming
ambition
to
posses
a
miller
thumb
and
would
sit
contentedly
for
a
long
time
rubbing
between
my
thumb
and
fingers
the
ground
wheat
as
it
fell
from
between
the
millstones
before
it
was
taken
up
on
an
endless
chain
of
mysterious
little
buckets
to
be
bolted
into
flour
i
believe
i
have
never
since
wanted
anything
more
desperately
than
i
wanted
my
right
thumb
to
be
flattened
as
my
father
had
become
during
his
earlier
years
of
a
miller
life
somewhat
discouraged
by
the
slow
process
of
structural
modification
i
also
took
measures
to
secure
on
the
backs
of
my
hands
the
tiny
purple
and
red
spots
which
are
always
found
on
the
hands
of
the
miller
who
dresses
millstones
the
marks
on
my
father
hands
had
grown
faint
but
were
quite
visible
when
looked
for
and
seemed
to
me
so
desirable
that
they
must
be
procured
at
all
costs
even
when
playing
in
our
house
or
yard
i
could
always
tell
when
the
millstones
were
being
dressed
because
the
rumbling
of
the
mill
then
stopped
and
there
were
few
pleasures
i
would
not
instantly
forego
rushing
at
once
to
the
mill
that
i
might
spread
out
my
hands
near
the
in
the
hope
that
the
little
hard
flints
flying
form
the
chisel
would
light
upon
their
backs
and
make
the
marks
i
used
hotly
to
accuse
the
german
miller
my
dear
friend
ferdinand
of
trying
not
to
hit
my
hands
but
he
scornfully
replied
that
he
could
not
hit
them
if
he
did
try
and
that
they
were
too
little
to
be
of
use
in
a
mill
anyway
although
i
hated
his
teasing
i
never
had
the
courage
to
confess
my
real
purpose
this
sincere
tribute
of
imitation
which
affection
offers
to
its
adored
object
had
later
i
hope
subtler
manifestations
but
certainly
these
first
ones
were
altogether
genuine
in
this
case
too
i
doubtless
contributed
my
share
to
that
stream
of
admiration
which
our
generation
so
generously
poured
forth
for
the
man
i
was
consumed
by
a
wistful
desire
to
apprehend
the
hardships
of
my
father
earlier
life
in
that
faraway
time
when
he
had
been
a
miller
apprentice
i
knew
that
he
still
woke
up
punctually
at
three
because
for
so
many
years
he
had
taken
his
turn
at
the
mill
in
the
early
morning
and
if
by
chance
i
awoke
at
the
same
hour
as
curiously
enough
i
often
did
i
imagined
him
in
the
early
dawn
in
my
uncle
old
mill
reading
through
the
entire
village
library
book
after
book
beginning
with
the
lives
of
the
signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
copies
of
the
same
books
mostly
bound
in
calfskin
were
to
be
found
in
the
library
below
and
i
courageously
resolved
that
i
too
would
read
them
all
and
try
to
understand
life
as
he
did
i
did
in
fact
later
begin
a
course
of
reading
in
the
early
morning
hours
but
i
was
caught
by
some
fantastic
notion
of
chronological
order
and
early
legendary
form
pope
translation
of
the
iliad
even
followed
by
virgil
did
not
leave
behind
the
residuum
of
wisdom
for
which
i
longed
and
i
finally
gave
them
up
for
a
thick
book
entitled
the
history
of
the
world
as
affording
a
shorter
and
an
easier
path
although
i
constantly
confided
my
sins
and
perplexities
to
my
father
there
are
only
a
few
occasions
on
which
i
remember
having
received
direct
advice
or
admonition
it
may
easily
be
true
however
that
i
have
forgotten
the
latter
in
the
manner
of
many
seekers
after
advice
who
enjoyably
set
forth
their
situation
but
do
not
really
listen
to
the
advice
itself
i
can
remember
an
admonition
on
one
occasion
however
when
as
a
little
girl
of
eight
years
arrayed
in
a
new
cloak
gorgeous
beyond
anything
i
had
ever
worn
before
i
stood
before
my
father
for
his
approval
i
was
much
chagrined
by
his
remark
that
it
was
a
very
pretty
cloak
in
fact
so
much
prettier
than
any
cloak
the
other
little
girls
in
the
sunday
school
had
that
he
would
advise
me
to
wear
my
old
cloak
which
would
keep
me
quite
as
warm
with
the
added
advantage
of
not
making
the
other
little
girls
feel
badly
i
complied
with
the
request
but
i
fear
without
inner
consent
and
i
certainly
was
quite
without
the
joy
of
as
i
walked
soberly
through
the
village
street
by
the
side
of
my
counselor
my
mind
was
busy
however
with
the
old
question
eternally
suggested
by
the
inequalities
of
the
human
lot
only
as
we
neared
the
church
door
did
i
venture
to
ask
what
could
be
done
about
it
receiving
the
reply
that
it
might
never
be
righted
so
far
as
clothes
went
but
that
people
might
be
equal
in
things
that
mattered
much
more
than
clothes
the
affairs
of
education
and
religion
for
instance
which
we
attended
to
when
we
went
to
school
and
church
and
that
it
was
very
stupid
to
wear
the
sort
of
clothes
that
made
it
harder
to
have
equality
even
there
it
must
have
been
a
little
later
when
i
held
a
conversation
with
my
father
upon
the
doctrine
of
foreordination
which
at
one
time
very
much
perplexed
my
childish
mind
after
setting
the
difficulty
before
him
and
complaining
that
i
could
not
make
it
out
although
my
best
friend
understood
it
perfectly
i
settled
down
to
hear
his
argument
having
no
doubt
that
he
could
make
it
quite
clear
to
my
delighted
surprise
for
any
intimation
that
our
minds
were
on
an
equality
lifted
me
high
indeed
he
said
that
he
feared
that
he
and
i
did
not
have
the
kind
of
mind
that
would
ever
understand
very
well
and
advised
me
not
to
give
too
much
time
to
it
but
he
then
proceeded
to
say
other
things
of
which
the
final
impression
left
upon
my
mind
was
that
it
did
not
matter
much
whether
one
understood
foreordination
or
not
but
that
it
was
very
important
not
to
pretend
to
understand
what
you
did
understand
and
that
you
must
always
be
honest
with
yourself
inside
whatever
happened
perhaps
on
the
whole
as
valuable
a
lesson
as
the
shorter
catechism
itself
contains
my
memory
merges
this
early
conversation
on
religious
doctrine
into
one
which
took
place
years
later
when
i
put
before
my
father
the
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
at
boarding
school
when
under
great
evangelical
pressure
and
once
again
i
heard
his
testimony
in
favor
of
mental
integrity
above
everything
else
at
the
time
we
were
driving
through
a
piece
of
timber
in
which
the
wood
choppers
had
been
at
work
during
the
winter
and
so
earnestly
were
we
talking
that
he
suddenly
drew
up
the
horses
to
find
that
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
we
were
both
entertained
by
the
incident
i
that
my
father
had
been
lost
in
his
own
timber
so
that
various
cords
of
wood
must
have
escaped
his
practiced
eye
and
he
on
his
side
that
he
should
have
become
so
absorbed
in
this
maze
of
youthful
speculation
we
were
in
high
spirits
as
we
emerged
from
the
tender
green
of
the
spring
woods
into
the
clear
light
of
day
and
as
we
came
back
into
the
main
road
i
categorically
asked
him
what
are
you
what
do
you
say
when
people
ask
you
his
eyes
twinkled
a
little
as
he
soberly
replied
i
am
a
quaker
but
that
is
enough
to
say
i
urged
very
well
he
added
to
people
who
insist
upon
details
as
some
one
is
doing
now
i
add
that
i
am
a
hicksite
quaker
and
not
another
word
on
the
weighty
subject
could
i
induce
him
to
utter
these
early
recollections
are
set
in
a
scene
of
rural
beauty
unusual
at
least
for
illinois
the
prairie
around
the
village
was
broken
into
hills
one
of
them
crowned
by
pine
woods
grown
up
from
a
bag
full
of
norway
pine
seeds
sown
by
my
father
in
the
very
year
he
came
to
illinois
a
testimony
perhaps
that
the
most
vigorous
pioneers
gave
at
least
an
occasional
thought
to
beauty
the
banks
of
the
mill
stream
rose
into
high
bluffs
too
perpendicular
to
be
climbed
without
skill
and
containing
caves
of
which
one
at
least
was
so
black
that
it
could
not
be
explored
without
the
aid
of
a
candle
and
there
was
a
deserted
limekiln
which
became
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
unpardonable
sin
of
hawthorne
my
stepbrother
and
i
carried
on
games
and
crusades
which
lasted
week
after
week
and
even
summer
after
summer
as
only
country
children
can
do
it
may
be
in
contrast
to
this
that
one
of
the
most
piteous
aspects
in
the
life
of
city
children
as
i
have
seen
it
in
the
neighborhood
of
is
the
constant
interruption
to
their
play
which
is
inevitable
on
the
streets
so
that
it
can
never
have
any
continuity
the
most
elaborate
plan
or
chart
or
fragment
from
their
dream
of
human
life
is
sure
to
be
rudely
destroyed
by
the
passing
traffic
although
they
start
over
and
over
again
even
the
most
vivacious
become
worn
out
at
last
and
take
to
that
passive
standing
varied
by
rude
horseplay
which
in
time
becomes
so
characteristic
of
city
children
we
had
of
course
our
favorite
places
and
trees
and
birds
and
flowers
it
is
hard
to
reproduce
the
companionship
which
children
establish
with
nature
but
certainly
it
is
much
too
unconscious
and
intimate
to
come
under
the
head
of
aesthetic
appreciation
or
anything
of
the
sort
when
we
said
that
the
purple
the
anemone
patens
looked
as
if
the
winds
had
made
them
we
thought
much
more
of
the
fact
that
they
were
than
that
they
were
beautiful
we
clapped
our
hands
in
sudden
joy
over
the
soft
radiance
of
the
rainbow
but
its
enchantment
lay
in
our
half
belief
that
a
pot
of
gold
was
to
be
found
at
its
farther
end
we
yielded
to
a
soft
melancholy
when
we
heard
the
whippoorwill
in
the
early
twilight
but
while
he
aroused
in
us
vague
longings
of
which
we
spoke
solemnly
we
felt
no
beauty
in
his
call
we
erected
an
altar
beside
the
stream
to
which
for
several
years
we
brought
all
the
snakes
we
killed
during
our
excursions
no
matter
how
long
the
toil
some
journey
which
we
had
to
make
with
a
limp
snake
dangling
between
two
sticks
i
remember
rather
vaguely
the
ceremonial
performed
upon
this
altar
one
autumn
day
when
we
brought
as
further
tribute
one
out
of
every
hundred
of
the
black
walnuts
which
we
had
gathered
and
then
poured
over
the
whole
a
pitcher
full
of
cider
fresh
from
the
cider
mill
on
the
barn
floor
i
think
we
had
also
burned
a
favorite
book
or
two
upon
this
pyre
of
stones
the
entire
affair
carried
on
with
such
solemnity
was
probably
the
result
of
one
of
those
imperative
impulses
under
whose
compulsion
children
seek
a
ceremonial
which
shall
express
their
sense
of
identification
with
man
primitive
life
and
their
familiar
kinship
with
the
remotest
past
long
before
we
had
begun
the
study
of
latin
at
the
village
school
my
brother
and
i
had
learned
the
lord
prayer
in
latin
out
of
an
old
copy
of
the
vulgate
and
gravely
repeated
it
every
night
in
an
execrable
pronunciation
because
it
seemed
to
us
more
religious
than
plain
english
when
however
i
really
prayed
what
i
saw
before
my
eyes
was
a
most
outrageous
picture
which
adorned
a
used
in
sunday
school
portraying
the
lord
upon
his
throne
surrounded
by
tiers
and
tiers
of
saints
and
angels
all
in
a
blur
of
yellow
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
how
old
i
was
when
that
picture
ceased
to
appear
before
my
eyes
especially
when
moments
of
terror
compelled
me
to
ask
protection
from
the
heavenly
powers
i
recall
with
great
distinctness
my
first
direct
contact
with
death
when
i
was
fifteen
years
old
polly
was
an
old
nurse
who
had
taken
care
of
my
mother
and
had
followed
her
to
frontier
illinois
to
help
rear
a
second
generation
of
children
she
had
always
lived
in
our
house
but
made
annual
visits
to
her
cousins
on
a
farm
a
few
miles
north
of
the
village
during
one
of
those
visits
word
came
to
us
one
sunday
evening
that
polly
was
dying
and
for
a
number
of
reasons
i
was
the
only
person
able
to
go
to
her
i
left
the
warm
house
to
be
driven
four
miles
through
a
blinding
storm
which
every
minute
added
more
snow
to
the
already
high
drifts
with
a
sense
of
starting
upon
a
fateful
errand
an
hour
after
my
arrival
all
of
the
cousin
family
went
downstairs
to
supper
and
i
was
left
alone
to
watch
with
polly
the
square
chamber
in
the
lonely
farmhouse
was
very
cold
and
still
with
nothing
to
be
heard
but
the
storm
outside
suddenly
the
great
change
came
i
heard
a
feeble
call
of
sarah
my
mother
name
as
the
dying
eyes
were
turned
upon
me
followed
by
a
curious
breathing
and
in
place
of
the
face
familiar
from
my
earliest
childhood
and
associated
with
homely
household
cares
there
lay
upon
the
pillow
strange
august
features
stern
and
withdrawn
from
all
the
small
affairs
of
life
that
sense
of
solitude
of
being
unsheltered
in
a
wide
world
of
relentless
and
elemental
forces
which
is
at
the
basis
of
childhood
timidity
and
which
is
far
from
outgrown
at
fifteen
seized
me
irresistibly
before
i
could
reach
the
narrow
stairs
and
summon
the
family
from
below
as
i
was
driven
home
in
the
winter
storm
the
wind
through
the
trees
seemed
laden
with
a
passing
soul
and
the
riddle
of
life
and
death
pressed
hard
once
to
be
young
to
grow
old
and
to
die
everything
came
to
that
and
then
a
mysterious
journey
out
into
the
unknown
did
she
mind
faring
forth
alone
would
the
journey
perhaps
end
in
something
as
familiar
and
natural
to
the
aged
and
dying
as
life
is
to
the
young
and
living
through
all
the
drive
and
indeed
throughout
the
night
these
thoughts
were
pierced
by
sharp
worry
a
sense
of
faithlessness
because
i
had
forgotten
the
text
polly
had
confided
to
me
long
before
as
the
one
from
which
she
wished
her
funeral
sermon
to
be
preached
my
comfort
as
usual
finally
came
from
my
father
who
pointed
out
what
was
essential
and
what
was
of
little
avail
even
in
such
a
moment
as
this
and
while
he
was
much
too
wise
to
grow
dogmatic
upon
the
great
theme
of
death
i
felt
a
new
fellowship
with
him
because
we
had
discussed
it
together
perhaps
i
may
record
here
my
protest
against
the
efforts
so
often
made
to
shield
children
and
young
people
from
all
that
has
to
do
with
death
and
sorrow
to
give
them
a
good
time
at
all
hazards
on
the
assumption
that
the
ills
of
life
will
come
soon
enough
young
people
themselves
often
resent
this
attitude
on
the
part
of
their
elders
they
feel
set
aside
and
belittled
as
if
they
were
denied
the
common
human
experiences
they
too
wish
to
climb
steep
stairs
and
to
eat
their
bread
with
tears
and
they
imagine
that
the
problems
of
existence
which
so
press
upon
them
in
pensive
moments
would
be
less
insoluble
in
the
light
of
these
great
happenings
an
incident
which
stands
out
clearly
in
my
mind
as
an
exciting
suggestion
of
the
great
world
of
moral
enterprise
and
serious
undertakings
must
have
occurred
earlier
than
this
for
in
when
i
was
not
yet
twelve
years
old
i
came
into
my
father
room
one
morning
to
find
him
sitting
beside
the
fire
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
looking
very
solemn
and
upon
my
eager
inquiry
what
had
happened
he
told
me
that
joseph
mazzini
was
dead
i
had
never
even
heard
mazzini
name
and
after
being
told
about
him
i
was
inclined
to
grow
argumentative
asserting
that
my
father
did
not
know
him
that
he
was
not
an
american
and
that
i
could
not
understand
why
we
should
be
expected
to
feel
badly
about
him
it
is
impossible
to
recall
the
conversation
with
the
complete
breakdown
of
my
cheap
arguments
but
in
the
end
i
obtained
that
which
i
have
ever
regarded
as
a
valuable
possession
a
sense
of
the
genuine
relationship
which
may
exist
between
men
who
share
large
hopes
and
like
desires
even
though
they
differ
in
nationality
language
and
creed
that
those
things
count
for
absolutely
nothing
between
groups
of
men
who
are
trying
to
abolish
slavery
in
america
or
to
throw
off
hapsburg
oppression
in
italy
at
any
rate
i
was
heartily
ashamed
of
my
meager
notion
of
patriotism
and
i
came
out
of
the
room
exhilarated
with
the
consciousness
that
impersonal
and
international
relations
are
actual
facts
and
not
mere
phrases
i
was
filled
with
pride
that
i
knew
a
man
who
held
converse
with
great
minds
and
who
really
sorrowed
and
rejoiced
over
happenings
across
the
sea
i
never
recall
those
early
conversations
with
my
father
nor
a
score
of
others
like
them
but
there
comes
into
my
mind
a
line
from
browning
in
which
a
daughter
describes
her
relations
with
her
father
he
wrapt
me
in
his
large
man

chapter
ii
influence
of
lincoln
i
suppose
all
the
children
who
were
born
about
the
time
of
the
civil
war
have
recollections
quite
unlike
those
of
the
children
who
are
living
now
although
i
was
but
four
and
a
half
years
old
when
lincoln
died
i
distinctly
remember
the
day
when
i
found
on
our
two
white
gateposts
american
flags
companioned
with
black
i
tumbled
down
on
the
harsh
gravel
walk
in
my
eager
rush
into
the
house
to
inquire
what
they
were
there
for
to
my
amazement
i
found
my
father
in
tears
something
that
i
had
never
seen
before
having
assumed
as
all
children
do
that
people
never
cried
the
two
flags
my
father
tears
and
his
impressive
statement
that
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
had
died
constituted
my
initiation
my
baptism
as
it
were
into
the
thrilling
and
solemn
interests
of
a
world
lying
quite
outside
the
two
white
gateposts
the
great
war
touched
children
in
many
ways
i
remember
an
engraved
roster
of
names
headed
by
the
words
guard
and
the
whole
surmounted
by
the
insignia
of
the
american
eagle
clutching
many
flags
which
always
hung
in
the
family
as
children
we
used
to
read
this
list
of
names
again
and
again
we
could
reach
it
only
by
dint
of
putting
the
family
bible
on
a
chair
and
piling
the
dictionary
on
top
of
it
using
the
bible
to
stand
on
was
always
accompanied
by
a
little
thrill
of
superstitious
awe
although
we
carefully
put
the
dictionary
above
that
our
profane
feet
might
touch
it
alone
having
brought
the
roster
within
reach
of
our
eager
fingers
fortunately
it
was
glazed
we
would
pick
out
the
names
of
those
who
had
fallen
on
the
field
from
those
who
had
come
back
from
the
war
and
from
among
the
latter
those
whose
children
were
our
schoolmates
when
drives
were
planned
we
would
say
let
us
take
this
road
that
we
might
pass
the
farm
where
a
soldier
had
once
lived
if
flowers
from
the
garden
were
to
be
given
away
we
would
want
them
to
go
to
the
mother
of
one
of
those
heroes
whose
names
we
knew
from
the
addams
guard
if
a
guest
should
become
interested
in
the
roster
on
the
wall
he
was
at
once
led
by
the
eager
children
to
a
small
picture
of
colonel
davis
which
hung
next
the
opposite
window
that
he
might
see
the
brave
colonel
of
the
regiment
the
introduction
to
the
picture
of
the
man
seemed
to
us
a
very
solemn
ceremony
and
long
after
the
guest
was
tired
of
listening
we
would
tell
each
other
all
about
the
local
hero
who
at
the
head
of
his
troops
had
suffered
wounds
unto
death
we
liked
very
much
to
talk
to
a
gentle
old
lady
who
lived
in
a
white
farmhouse
a
mile
north
of
the
village
she
was
the
mother
of
the
village
hero
tommy
and
used
to
tell
us
of
her
long
anxiety
during
the
spring
of
how
she
waited
day
after
day
for
the
hospital
to
surrender
up
her
son
each
morning
airing
the
white
homespun
sheets
and
holding
the
little
bedroom
in
immaculate
readiness
it
was
after
the
battle
of
fort
donelson
that
tommy
was
wounded
and
had
been
taken
to
the
hospital
at
springfield
his
father
went
down
to
him
and
saw
him
getting
worse
each
week
until
it
was
clear
that
he
was
going
to
die
but
there
was
so
much
red
tape
about
the
department
and
affairs
were
so
confused
that
his
discharge
could
not
be
procured
at
last
the
hospital
surgeon
intimated
to
his
father
that
he
should
quietly
take
him
away
a
man
as
sick
as
that
it
would
be
all
right
but
when
they
told
tommy
weak
as
he
was
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
said
no
sir
i
will
go
out
of
the
front
door
or
i
die
here
of
course
after
that
every
man
in
the
hospital
worked
for
it
and
in
two
weeks
he
was
honorably
discharged
when
he
came
home
at
last
his
mother
heart
was
broken
to
see
him
so
wan
and
changed
she
would
tell
us
of
the
long
quiet
days
that
followed
his
return
with
the
windows
open
so
that
the
dying
eyes
might
look
over
the
orchard
slope
to
the
meadow
beyond
where
the
younger
brothers
were
mowing
the
early
hay
she
told
us
of
those
days
when
his
school
friends
from
the
academy
flocked
in
to
see
him
their
old
acknowledged
leader
and
of
the
burning
words
of
earnest
patriotism
spoken
in
the
crowded
little
room
so
that
in
three
months
the
academy
was
almost
deserted
and
the
new
company
who
marched
away
in
the
autumn
took
as
drummer
boy
tommy
third
brother
who
was
only
seventeen
and
too
young
for
a
regular
she
remembered
the
still
darker
days
that
followed
when
the
bright
drummer
boy
was
in
andersonville
prison
and
little
by
little
she
learned
to
be
reconciled
that
tommy
was
safe
in
the
peaceful
home
graveyard
however
much
we
were
given
to
talk
of
war
heroes
we
always
fell
silent
as
we
approached
an
isolated
farmhouse
in
which
two
old
people
lived
alone
five
of
their
sons
had
enlisted
in
the
civil
war
and
only
the
youngest
had
returned
alive
in
the
spring
of
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
when
he
was
hunting
for
wild
ducks
in
a
swamp
on
the
rough
little
farm
itself
he
was
accidently
shot
and
killed
and
the
old
people
were
left
alone
to
struggle
with
the
land
as
best
they
might
when
we
were
driven
past
this
forlorn
little
farm
our
childish
voices
always
dropped
into
speculative
whisperings
as
to
how
the
accident
could
have
happened
to
this
remaining
son
out
of
all
the
men
in
the
world
to
him
who
had
escaped
so
many
chances
of
death
our
young
hearts
swelled
in
first
rebellion
against
that
which
walter
pater
calls
the
inexplicable
shortcoming
or
misadventure
on
the
part
of
life
itself
we
were
overwhelmingly
oppressed
by
that
grief
of
things
as
they
are
so
much
more
mysterious
and
intolerable
than
those
griefs
which
we
think
dimly
to
trace
to
man
own
wrongdoing
it
was
well
perhaps
that
life
thus
early
gave
me
a
hint
of
one
of
her
most
obstinate
and
insoluble
riddles
for
i
have
sorely
needed
the
sense
of
universality
thus
imparted
to
that
mysterious
injustice
the
burden
of
which
we
are
all
forced
to
bear
and
with
which
i
have
become
only
too
familiar
my
childish
admiration
for
lincoln
is
closely
associated
with
a
visit
made
to
the
war
eagle
old
abe
who
as
we
children
well
knew
lived
in
the
state
capital
of
wisconsin
only
miles
north
of
our
house
really
no
farther
than
an
eagle
could
easily
fly
he
had
been
carried
by
the
eighth
wisconsin
regiment
through
the
entire
war
and
now
dwelt
an
honored
pensioner
in
the
state
building
itself
many
times
standing
in
the
north
end
of
our
orchard
which
was
only
twelve
miles
from
that
mysterious
line
which
divided
illinois
from
wisconsin
we
anxiously
scanned
the
deep
sky
hoping
to
see
old
abe
fly
southward
right
over
our
apple
trees
for
it
was
clearly
possible
that
he
might
at
any
moment
escape
from
his
keeper
who
although
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
a
sentinel
would
have
to
sleep
sometimes
we
gazed
with
thrilled
interest
at
one
speck
after
another
in
the
flawless
sky
but
although
old
abe
never
came
to
see
us
a
much
more
incredible
thing
happened
for
we
were
at
last
taken
to
see
him
we
started
one
golden
summer
day
two
happy
children
in
the
family
carriage
with
my
father
and
mother
and
an
older
sister
to
whom
because
she
was
just
home
from
boarding
school
we
confidently
appealed
whenever
we
needed
information
we
were
driven
northward
hour
after
hour
past
harvest
fields
in
which
the
stubble
glinted
from
bronze
to
gold
and
the
grain
rested
luxuriously
in
rounded
shocks
until
we
reached
that
beautiful
region
of
hills
and
lakes
which
surrounds
the
capital
city
of
wisconsin
but
although
old
abe
sitting
sedately
upon
his
high
perch
was
sufficiently
like
an
uplifted
ensign
to
remind
us
of
a
roman
eagle
and
although
his
veteran
keeper
clad
in
an
old
army
coat
was
ready
to
answer
all
our
questions
and
to
tell
us
of
the
battles
and
skirmishes
which
old
abe
had
passed
unscathed
the
crowning
moment
of
the
impressive
journey
came
to
me
later
illustrating
once
more
that
children
are
as
quick
to
catch
the
meaning
of
a
symbol
as
they
are
unaccountably
slow
to
understand
the
real
world
about
them
the
entire
journey
to
the
veteran
war
eagle
had
itself
symbolized
that
search
for
the
heroic
and
perfect
which
so
persistently
haunts
the
young
and
as
i
stood
under
the
great
white
dome
of
old
abe
stately
home
for
one
brief
moment
the
search
was
rewarded
i
dimly
caught
a
hint
of
what
men
have
tried
to
say
in
their
effort
to
imprison
a
space
in
so
divine
a
line
that
it
shall
hold
only
yearning
devotion
and
hopes
certainly
the
utmost
rim
of
my
first
dome
was
filled
with
the
tumultuous
impression
of
soldiers
marching
to
death
for
sake
of
pioneers
streaming
westward
to
establish
in
yet
another
sovereign
state
only
the
great
dome
of
peter
itself
has
ever
clutched
my
heart
as
did
that
modest
curve
which
had
sequestered
from
infinitude
in
a
place
small
enough
for
my
child
mind
the
courage
and
endurance
which
i
could
not
comprehend
so
long
as
it
was
lost
in
the
void
of
unresponsible
space
under
the
vaulting
sky
itself
but
through
all
my
vivid
sensations
there
persisted
the
image
of
the
eagle
in
the
corridor
below
and
lincoln
himself
as
an
epitome
of
all
that
was
great
and
good
i
dimly
caught
the
notion
of
the
martyred
president
as
the
standard
bearer
to
the
conscience
of
his
countrymen
as
the
eagle
had
been
the
ensign
of
courage
to
the
soldiers
of
the
wisconsin
regiment
years
later
as
i
stood
on
the
hill
campus
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
with
a
commanding
view
of
the
capitol
building
a
mile
directly
across
the
city
i
saw
again
the
dome
which
had
so
uplifted
my
childish
spirit
the
university
which
was
celebrating
it
fiftieth
anniversary
had
honored
me
with
a
doctor
degree
and
in
the
midst
of
the
academic
pomp
and
the
rejoicing
the
dome
again
appeared
to
me
as
a
fitting
symbol
of
the
state
aspiration
even
in
its
high
mission
of
universal
education
thousands
of
children
in
the
sixties
and
seventies
in
the
simplicity
which
is
given
to
the
understanding
of
a
child
caught
a
notion
of
imperishable
heroism
when
they
were
told
that
brave
men
had
lost
their
lives
that
the
slaves
might
be
free
at
any
moment
the
conversation
of
our
elders
might
turn
upon
these
heroic
events
there
were
days
when
a
certain
general
came
to
see
my
father
and
again
when
governor
oglesby
whom
all
illinois
children
called
uncle
dick
spent
a
sunday
under
the
pine
trees
in
our
front
yard
we
felt
on
those
days
a
connection
with
the
great
world
so
much
more
heroic
than
the
village
world
which
surrounded
us
through
all
the
other
days
my
father
was
a
member
of
the
state
senate
for
the
sixteen
years
between
and
and
even
as
a
little
child
i
was
dimly
conscious
of
the
grave
march
of
public
affairs
in
his
comings
and
goings
at
the
state
capital
he
was
much
too
occupied
to
allow
time
for
reminiscence
but
i
remember
overhearing
a
conversation
between
a
visitor
and
himself
concerning
the
stirring
days
before
the
war
when
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
the
union
men
in
the
legislature
would
always
have
enough
votes
to
keep
illinois
from
seceding
i
heard
with
breathless
interest
my
father
account
of
the
trip
a
majority
of
the
legislators
had
made
one
dark
day
to
louis
that
there
might
not
be
enough
men
for
a
quorum
and
so
no
vote
could
be
taken
on
the
momentous
question
until
the
union
men
could
rally
their
forces
my
father
always
spoke
of
the
martyred
president
as
lincoln
and
i
never
heard
the
great
name
without
a
thrill
i
remember
the
day
it
must
have
been
one
of
comparative
leisure
perhaps
a
sunday
when
at
my
request
my
father
took
out
of
his
desk
a
thin
packet
marked
lincoln
letters
the
shortest
one
of
which
bore
unmistakable
traces
of
that
remarkable
personality
these
letters
began
my
dear
addams
and
to
the
inquiry
as
to
how
the
person
thus
addressed
was
about
to
vote
on
a
certain
measure
then
before
the
legislature
was
added
the
assurance
that
he
knew
that
this
addams
would
vote
according
to
his
conscience
but
he
begged
to
know
in
which
direction
the
same
conscience
was
pointing
as
my
father
folded
up
the
bits
of
paper
i
fairly
held
my
breath
in
my
desire
that
he
should
go
on
with
the
reminiscence
of
this
wonderful
man
whom
he
had
known
in
his
comparative
obscurity
or
better
still
that
he
should
be
moved
to
tell
some
of
the
exciting
incidents
of
the
debates
there
were
at
least
two
pictures
of
lincoln
that
always
hung
in
my
father
room
and
one
in
our
upstairs
parlor
of
lincoln
with
little
tad
for
one
or
all
of
these
reasons
i
always
tend
to
associate
lincoln
with
the
tenderest
thoughts
of
my
father
i
recall
a
time
of
great
perplexity
in
the
summer
of
when
chicago
was
filled
with
federal
troops
sent
there
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
their
presence
was
resented
by
the
governor
of
the
state
that
i
walked
the
wearisome
way
from
to
lincoln
park
for
no
cars
were
running
regularly
at
that
moment
of
sympathetic
strikes
in
order
to
look
at
and
gain
magnanimous
counsel
if
i
might
from
the
marvelous
gaudens
statue
which
had
been
but
recently
been
placed
at
the
entrance
of
the
park
some
of
lincoln
immortal
words
were
cut
into
the
stone
at
his
feet
and
never
did
a
distracted
town
more
sorely
need
the
healing
of
with
charity
towards
all
than
did
chicago
at
that
moment
and
the
tolerance
of
the
man
who
had
won
charity
for
those
on
both
sides
of
an
irrepressible
conflict
of
the
many
things
written
of
my
father
in
that
sad
august
in
when
he
died
the
one
i
cared
for
most
was
written
by
an
old
political
friend
of
his
who
was
then
editor
of
a
great
chicago
daily
he
wrote
that
while
there
were
doubtless
many
members
of
the
illinois
legislature
who
during
the
great
contracts
of
the
war
time
and
the
demoralizing
reconstruction
days
that
followed
had
never
accepted
a
bribe
he
wished
to
bear
testimony
that
he
personally
had
known
but
this
one
man
who
had
never
been
offered
a
bribe
because
bad
men
were
instinctively
afraid
of
him
i
feel
now
the
hot
chagrin
with
which
i
recalled
this
statement
during
those
early
efforts
of
illinois
in
which
house
joined
to
secure
the
passage
of
the
first
factory
legislation
i
was
told
by
the
representatives
of
an
informal
association
of
manufacturers
that
if
the
residents
of
would
drop
this
nonsense
about
a
sweatshop
bill
of
which
they
knew
nothing
certain
business
men
would
agree
to
give
fifty
thousand
dollars
within
two
years
to
be
used
for
any
of
the
philanthropic
activities
of
the
settlement
as
the
fact
broke
upon
me
that
i
was
being
offered
a
bribe
the
shame
was
enormously
increased
by
the
memory
of
this
statement
what
had
befallen
the
daughter
of
my
father
that
such
a
thing
could
happen
to
her
the
salutary
reflection
that
it
could
not
have
occurred
unless
a
weakness
in
myself
had
permitted
it
withheld
me
at
least
from
an
historic
display
of
indignation
before
the
two
men
making
the
offer
and
i
explained
as
gently
as
i
could
that
we
had
no
ambition
to
make
the
largest
institution
on
the
west
side
but
that
we
were
much
concerned
that
our
neighbors
should
be
protected
from
untoward
conditions
of
work
and
so
much
heroics
youth
must
permit
itself
if
to
accomplish
this
the
destruction
of
was
necessary
that
we
would
cheerfully
sing
a
te
deum
on
its
ruins
the
good
friend
who
had
invited
me
to
lunch
at
the
union
league
club
to
meet
two
of
his
friends
who
wanted
to
talk
over
the
sweat
shop
bill
here
kindly
intervened
and
we
all
hastened
to
cover
the
awkward
situation
by
that
scurrying
away
from
ugly
morality
which
seems
to
be
an
obligation
of
social
intercourse
of
the
many
old
friends
of
my
father
who
kindly
came
to
look
up
his
daughter
in
the
first
days
of
i
recall
none
with
more
pleasure
than
lyman
trumbull
whom
we
used
to
point
out
to
members
of
the
young
citizen
club
as
the
man
who
had
for
days
held
in
his
keeping
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
until
his
friend
president
lincoln
was
ready
to
issue
it
i
remember
the
talk
he
gave
at
on
one
of
our
early
celebrations
of
lincoln
birthday
his
assertion
that
lincoln
was
no
cheap
popular
hero
that
the
common
people
would
have
to
make
an
effort
if
they
would
understand
his
greatness
as
lincoln
painstakingly
made
a
long
effort
to
understand
the
greatness
of
the
people
there
was
something
in
the
admiration
of
contemporaries
or
at
least
of
those
men
who
had
known
him
personally
which
was
quite
unlike
even
the
best
of
the
devotion
and
reverent
understanding
which
has
developed
since
in
the
first
place
they
had
so
large
a
fund
of
common
experience
they
too
had
pioneered
in
a
western
country
and
had
urged
the
development
of
canals
and
railroads
in
order
that
the
raw
prairie
crops
might
be
transported
to
market
they
too
had
realized
that
if
this
last
tremendous
experiment
in
failed
here
it
would
be
the
disappointment
of
the
centuries
and
that
upon
their
ability
to
organize
in
state
county
and
town
depended
the
verdict
of
history
these
men
also
knew
as
lincoln
himself
did
that
if
this
tremendous
experiment
was
to
come
to
fruition
it
must
be
brought
about
by
the
people
themselves
that
there
was
no
other
capital
fund
upon
which
to
draw
i
remember
an
incident
occurring
when
i
was
about
fifteen
years
old
in
which
the
conviction
was
driven
into
my
mind
that
the
people
themselves
were
the
great
resource
of
the
country
my
father
had
made
a
little
address
of
reminiscence
at
a
meeting
of
the
old
settlers
of
stephenson
county
which
was
held
every
summer
in
the
grove
beside
the
mill
relating
his
experiences
in
inducing
the
farmers
of
the
county
to
subscribe
for
stock
in
the
northwestern
railroad
which
was
the
first
to
penetrate
the
county
and
make
a
connection
with
the
great
lakes
at
chicago
many
of
the
pennsylvania
german
farmers
doubted
the
value
of
the
whole
business
and
had
no
use
for
any
railroad
much
less
for
one
in
which
they
were
asked
to
risk
their
savings
my
father
told
of
his
despair
in
one
farmers
community
dominated
by
such
prejudice
which
did
not
in
the
least
give
way
under
his
argument
but
finally
melted
under
the
enthusiasm
of
a
german
matron
who
took
a
share
to
be
paid
for
out
of
butter
and
egg
money
as
he
related
his
admiration
of
her
an
old
woman
piping
voice
in
the
audience
called
out
i
here
addams
and
i
do
it
again
if
you
asked
me
the
old
woman
bent
and
broken
by
her
seventy
years
of
toilsome
life
was
brought
to
the
platform
and
i
was
much
impressed
by
my
grave
presentation
of
her
as
one
of
the
pioneers
to
whose
heroic
fortitude
we
are
indebted
for
the
development
of
this
country
i
remember
that
i
was
at
that
time
reading
with
great
enthusiasm
carlyle
heroes
and
hero
worship
but
on
the
evening
of
old
settlers
day
to
my
surprise
i
found
it
difficult
to
go
on
its
sonorous
sentences
and
exaltation
of
the
man
who
can
suddenly
ceased
to
be
convincing
i
had
already
written
down
in
my
commonplace
book
a
resolution
to
give
at
least
copies
of
this
book
each
year
to
noble
young
people
of
my
acquaintance
it
is
perhaps
fitting
in
this
chapter
that
the
very
first
christmas
we
spent
at
in
spite
of
exigent
demands
upon
my
slender
purse
for
candy
and
shoes
i
gave
to
a
club
of
boys
copies
of
the
then
new
carl
appreciation
of
abraham
lincoln
in
our
early
effort
at
to
hand
on
to
our
neighbors
whatever
of
help
we
had
found
for
ourselves
we
made
much
of
lincoln
we
were
often
distressed
by
the
children
of
immigrant
parents
who
were
ashamed
of
the
pit
whence
they
were
digged
who
repudiated
the
language
and
customs
of
their
elders
and
counted
themselves
successful
as
they
were
able
to
ignore
the
past
whenever
i
held
up
lincoln
for
their
admiration
as
the
greatest
american
i
invariably
pointed
out
his
marvelous
power
to
retain
and
utilize
past
experiences
that
he
never
forgot
how
the
plain
people
in
sangamon
county
thought
and
felt
when
he
himself
had
moved
to
town
that
this
habit
was
the
foundation
for
his
marvelous
capacity
for
growth
that
during
those
distracting
years
in
washington
it
enabled
him
to
make
clear
beyond
denial
to
the
american
people
themselves
the
goal
towards
which
they
were
moving
i
was
sometimes
bold
enough
to
add
that
proficiency
in
the
art
of
recognition
and
comprehension
did
not
come
without
effort
and
that
certainly
its
attainment
was
necessary
for
any
successful
career
in
our
conglomerate
america
an
instance
of
the
invigorating
and
clarifying
power
of
influence
came
to
me
many
years
ago
in
england
i
had
spent
two
days
in
oxford
under
the
guidance
of
arnold
toynbee
old
friend
sidney
ball
of
john
college
who
was
closely
associated
with
the
group
of
scholars
we
all
identify
with
the
beginnings
of
the
settlement
movement
it
was
easy
to
claim
the
philosophy
of
thomas
hill
green
the
episode
of
ruskin
the
experimental
living
in
the
east
end
by
frederick
maurice
the
london
workingman
college
of
edward
dennison
as
foundations
laid
by
university
men
for
the
establishment
of
toynbee
hall
i
was
naturally
much
interested
in
the
beginnings
of
the
movement
whose
slogan
was
back
to
the
people
and
which
could
doubtless
claim
the
settlement
as
one
of
its
manifestations
nevertheless
the
processes
by
which
so
simple
a
conclusion
as
residence
among
the
poor
in
east
london
was
reached
seemed
to
me
very
involved
and
roundabout
however
inevitable
these
processes
might
be
for
englishmen
they
could
not
but
seem
artificial
to
a
western
american
who
had
been
born
in
a
rural
community
where
the
early
pioneer
life
had
made
social
distinctions
impossible
always
on
the
alert
lest
american
settlements
should
become
mere
echoes
and
imitations
of
the
english
movement
i
found
myself
assenting
to
what
was
shown
me
only
with
that
part
of
my
consciousness
which
had
been
formed
by
reading
of
english
social
movements
while
at
the
same
time
the
rustic
american
looked
on
in
detached
comment
why
should
an
american
be
lost
in
admiration
of
a
group
of
oxford
students
because
they
went
out
to
mend
a
disused
road
inspired
thereto
by
ruskin
teaching
for
the
bettering
of
the
common
life
when
all
the
country
roads
in
america
were
mended
each
spring
by
citizens
who
were
thus
carrying
out
the
simple
method
devised
by
a
democratic
government
for
providing
highways
no
humor
penetrated
my
high
mood
even
as
i
somewhat
uneasily
recalled
certain
spring
thaws
when
i
had
been
mired
in
roads
provided
by
the
american
citizen
i
continued
to
fumble
for
a
synthesis
which
i
was
unable
to
make
until
i
developed
that
uncomfortable
sense
of
playing
two
roles
at
once
it
was
therefore
almost
with
a
dual
consciousness
that
i
was
ushered
during
the
last
afternoon
of
my
oxford
stay
into
the
drawingroom
of
the
master
of
balliol
edward
caird
evolution
of
religion
which
i
had
read
but
a
year
or
two
before
had
been
of
unspeakable
comfort
to
me
in
the
labyrinth
of
differing
ethical
teachings
and
religious
creeds
which
the
many
immigrant
colonies
of
our
neighborhood
presented
i
remember
that
i
wanted
very
much
to
ask
the
author
himself
how
far
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
the
same
quality
of
virtue
and
a
similar
standard
of
conduct
from
these
divers
people
i
was
timidly
trying
to
apply
his
method
of
study
to
those
groups
of
homesick
immigrants
huddled
together
in
strange
tenement
houses
among
whom
i
seemed
to
detect
the
beginnings
of
a
secular
religion
or
at
least
of
a
wide
humanitarianism
evolved
out
of
the
various
exigencies
of
the
situation
somewhat
as
a
household
of
children
whose
mother
is
dead
out
of
their
sudden
necessity
perform
unaccustomed
offices
for
each
other
and
awkwardly
exchange
consolations
as
children
in
happier
households
never
dream
of
doing
perhaps
caird
could
tell
me
whether
there
was
any
religious
content
in
this
faith
to
each
other
this
fidelity
of
fellow
wanderers
in
a
desert
place
but
when
tea
was
over
and
my
opportunity
came
for
a
talk
with
my
host
i
suddenly
remembered
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
associations
only
caird
fine
analysis
of
abraham
lincoln
delivered
in
a
lecture
two
years
before
the
memory
of
lincoln
the
mention
of
his
name
came
like
a
refreshing
breeze
from
off
the
prairie
blowing
aside
all
the
scholarly
implications
in
which
i
had
become
so
reluctantly
involved
and
as
the
philosopher
spoke
of
the
great
american
who
was
content
merely
to
dig
the
channels
through
which
the
moral
life
of
his
countrymen
might
flow
i
was
gradually
able
to
make
a
natural
connection
between
this
intellectual
penetration
at
oxford
and
the
moral
perception
which
is
always
necessary
for
the
discovery
of
new
methods
by
which
to
minister
to
human
needs
in
the
unceasing
ebb
and
flow
of
justice
and
oppression
we
must
all
dig
channels
as
best
we
may
that
at
the
propitious
moment
somewhat
of
the
swelling
tide
may
be
conducted
to
the
barren
places
of
life
gradually
a
healing
sense
of
enveloped
me
and
a
quick
remorse
for
my
blindness
as
i
realized
that
no
one
among
his
own
countrymen
had
been
able
to
interpret
lincoln
greatness
more
nobly
than
this
oxford
scholar
had
done
and
that
vision
and
wisdom
as
well
as
high
motives
must
lie
behind
every
effective
stroke
in
the
continuous
labor
for
human
equality
i
remembered
that
another
master
of
balliol
jowett
himself
had
said
that
it
was
fortunate
for
society
that
every
age
possessed
at
least
a
few
minds
which
like
arnold
toynbee
were
perpetually
disturbed
over
the
apparent
inequalities
of
mankind
certainly
both
the
english
and
american
settlements
could
unite
in
confessing
to
that
disturbance
of
mind
traces
of
this
oxford
visit
are
curiously
reflected
in
a
paper
i
wrote
soon
after
my
return
at
the
request
of
the
american
academy
of
political
and
social
science
it
begins
as
follows
the
word
settlement
which
we
have
borrowed
from
london
is
apt
to
grate
a
little
upon
american
ears
it
is
not
after
all
so
long
ago
that
americans
who
settled
were
those
who
had
adventured
into
a
new
country
where
they
were
pioneers
in
the
midst
of
difficult
surroundings
the
word
still
implies
migrating
from
one
condition
of
life
to
another
totally
unlike
it
and
against
this
implication
the
resident
of
an
american
settlement
takes
alarm
we
do
not
like
to
acknowledge
that
americans
are
divided
into

iii
ideals
as
my
three
older
sisters
had
already
attended
the
seminary
at
rockford
of
which
my
father
was
trustee
without
any
question
i
entered
there
at
seventeen
with
such
meager
preparation
in
latin
and
algebra
as
the
village
school
had
afforded
i
was
very
ambitious
to
go
to
smith
college
although
i
well
knew
that
my
father
theory
in
regard
to
the
education
of
his
daughters
implied
a
school
as
near
at
home
as
possible
to
be
followed
by
travel
abroad
in
lieu
of
the
wider
advantages
which
the
eastern
college
is
supposed
to
afford
i
was
much
impressed
by
the
recent
return
of
my
sister
from
a
year
in
europe
yet
i
was
greatly
disappointed
at
the
moment
of
starting
to
humdrum
rockford
after
the
first
weeks
of
homesickness
were
over
however
i
became
very
much
absorbed
in
the
little
world
which
the
boarding
school
in
any
form
always
offers
to
its
students
the
school
at
rockford
in
had
not
changed
its
name
from
seminary
to
college
although
it
numbered
on
its
faculty
and
among
its
alumnae
college
women
who
were
most
eager
that
this
should
be
done
and
who
really
accomplished
it
during
the
next
five
years
the
school
was
one
of
the
earliest
efforts
for
women
higher
education
in
the
mississippi
valley
and
from
the
beginning
was
called
the
mount
holyoke
of
the
west
it
reflected
much
of
the
missionary
spirit
of
that
pioneer
institution
and
the
proportion
of
missionaries
among
its
early
graduates
was
almost
as
large
as
mount
holyoke
own
in
addition
there
had
been
thrown
about
the
founders
of
the
early
western
school
the
glamour
of
frontier
privations
and
the
first
students
conscious
of
the
heroic
made
in
their
behalf
felt
that
each
minute
of
the
time
thus
dearly
bought
must
be
conscientiously
used
this
inevitably
fostered
an
atmosphere
of
intensity
a
fever
of
preparation
which
continued
long
after
the
direct
making
of
it
had
ceased
and
which
the
later
girls
accepted
as
they
did
the
campus
and
the
buildings
without
knowing
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise
there
was
moreover
always
present
in
the
school
a
larger
or
smaller
group
of
girls
who
consciously
accepted
this
heritage
and
persistently
endeavored
to
fulfill
its
obligation
we
worked
in
those
early
years
as
if
we
really
believed
the
portentous
statement
from
aristotle
which
we
found
quoted
in
johnson
and
with
which
we
illuminated
the
wall
of
the
room
occupied
by
our
chess
club
it
remained
there
for
months
solely
out
of
reverence
let
us
hope
for
the
two
ponderous
names
associated
with
it
at
least
i
have
enough
confidence
in
human
nature
to
assert
that
we
never
really
believed
that
there
is
the
same
difference
between
the
learned
and
the
unlearned
as
there
is
between
the
living
and
the
dead
we
were
also
too
fond
of
quoting
carlyle
to
the
effect
is
not
to
taste
sweet
things
but
to
do
noble
and
true
things
that
the
poorest
son
of
adam
dimly
longs
as
i
attempt
to
reconstruct
the
spirit
of
my
contemporary
group
by
looking
over
many
documents
i
find
nothing
more
amusing
than
a
plaint
registered
against
life
indistinctness
which
i
imagine
more
or
less
reflected
the
sentiments
of
all
of
us
at
any
rate
here
it
is
for
the
entertainment
of
the
reader
if
not
for
his
edification
so
much
of
our
time
is
spent
in
preparation
so
much
in
routine
and
so
much
in
sleep
we
find
it
difficult
to
have
any
experience
at
all
we
did
not
however
tamely
accept
such
a
state
of
affairs
for
we
made
various
and
restless
attempts
to
break
through
this
dull
obtuseness
at
one
time
five
of
us
tried
to
understand
de
quincey
marvelous
dreams
more
sympathetically
by
drugging
ourselves
with
opium
we
solemnly
consumed
small
white
powders
at
intervals
during
an
entire
long
holiday
but
no
mental
reorientation
took
place
and
the
suspense
and
excitement
did
not
even
permit
us
to
grow
sleepy
about
four
on
the
weird
afternoon
the
young
teacher
whom
we
had
been
obliged
to
take
into
our
confidence
grew
alarmed
over
the
whole
performance
took
away
our
de
quincey
and
all
the
remaining
powders
administrated
an
emetic
to
each
of
the
five
aspirants
for
sympathetic
understanding
of
all
human
experience
and
sent
us
to
our
separate
rooms
with
a
stern
command
to
appear
at
family
worship
after
supper
whether
we
were
able
to
or
not
whenever
we
had
a
chance
to
write
we
took
of
course
large
themes
usually
from
the
greek
because
they
were
the
most
stirring
to
the
imagination
the
greek
oration
i
gave
at
our
junior
exhibition
was
written
with
infinite
pains
and
taken
to
the
greek
professor
in
beloit
college
that
there
might
be
no
mistakes
even
after
the
rockford
college
teacher
and
the
most
scholarly
clergyman
in
town
had
both
passed
upon
it
the
oration
upon
bellerophon
and
his
successful
fight
with
the
chimera
contended
that
social
evils
could
only
be
overcome
by
him
who
soared
above
them
into
idealism
as
bellerophon
mounted
upon
the
winged
horse
pegasus
had
slain
the
earthy
dragon
there
were
practically
no
economics
taught
in
women
colleges
at
least
in
the
ones
thirty
years
ago
although
we
painstakingly
studied
mental
and
moral
philosophy
which
though
far
from
dry
in
the
classroom
became
the
subject
of
more
spirited
discussion
outside
and
gave
us
a
clew
for
animated
rummaging
in
the
little
college
library
of
course
we
read
a
great
deal
of
ruskin
and
browning
and
liked
the
most
abstruse
parts
the
best
but
like
the
famous
gentleman
who
talked
prose
without
knowing
it
we
never
dreamed
of
connecting
them
with
our
philosophy
my
genuine
interest
was
history
partly
because
of
a
superior
teacher
and
partly
because
my
father
had
always
insisted
upon
a
certain
amount
of
historic
reading
ever
since
he
had
paid
me
as
a
little
girl
five
cents
a
life
for
each
plutarch
hero
i
could
intelligently
report
to
him
and
cents
for
every
volume
of
irving
life
of
washington
when
we
started
for
the
long
vacations
a
little
group
of
five
would
vow
that
during
the
summer
we
would
read
all
of
dutch
republic
or
more
ambitious
still
all
of
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
when
we
returned
at
the
opening
of
school
and
three
of
us
announced
we
had
finished
the
latter
each
became
skeptical
of
the
other
two
we
fell
upon
each
other
in
a
sort
of
examination
in
which
no
quarter
was
given
or
received
but
the
suspicion
was
finally
removed
that
anyone
had
skipped
we
took
for
a
class
motto
the
early
saxon
word
for
lady
translated
into
breadgiver
and
we
took
for
our
class
color
the
poppy
because
poppies
grow
among
the
wheat
as
if
nature
knew
that
wherever
there
was
hunger
that
needed
food
there
would
be
pain
that
needed
relief
we
must
have
found
the
sentiment
in
a
book
somewhere
but
we
used
it
so
much
it
finally
seemed
like
an
idea
of
our
own
although
of
course
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
a
european
field
the
only
page
upon
which
nature
has
written
this
particular
message
that
this
group
of
ardent
girls
who
discussed
everything
under
the
sun
with
unabated
interest
did
not
take
it
all
out
in
talk
may
be
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
one
of
the
class
who
married
a
missionary
founded
a
very
successful
school
in
japan
for
the
children
of
the
english
and
americans
living
there
another
of
the
class
became
a
medical
missionary
to
korea
and
because
of
her
successful
treatment
of
the
queen
was
made
court
physician
at
a
time
when
the
opening
was
considered
of
importance
in
the
diplomatic
as
well
as
in
the
missionary
world
still
another
became
an
unusually
skilled
teacher
of
the
blind
and
one
of
them
a
pioneer
librarian
in
that
early
effort
to
bring
books
to
the
people
perhaps
this
early
companionship
showed
me
how
essentially
similar
are
the
various
forms
of
social
effort
and
curiously
enough
the
actual
activities
of
a
missionary
school
are
not
unlike
many
that
are
carried
on
in
a
settlement
situated
in
a
foreign
quarter
certainly
the
most
sympathetic
and
comprehending
visitors
we
have
ever
had
at
have
been
returned
missionaries
among
them
two
elderly
ladies
who
had
lived
for
years
in
india
and
who
had
been
homesick
and
bewildered
since
their
return
declared
that
the
fortnight
at
had
been
the
happiest
and
most
familiar
they
had
had
in
america
of
course
in
such
an
atmosphere
a
girl
like
myself
of
serious
not
to
say
priggish
tendency
did
not
escape
a
concerted
pressure
to
push
her
into
the
missionary
field
during
the
four
years
it
was
inevitable
that
every
sort
of
evangelical
appeal
should
have
been
made
to
reach
the
comparatively
few
unconverted
girls
in
the
school
we
were
the
subject
of
prayer
at
the
daily
chapel
exercise
and
the
weekly
prayer
meeting
attendance
upon
which
was
obligatory
i
was
singularly
unresponsive
to
all
these
forms
of
emotional
appeal
although
i
became
unspeakably
embarrassed
when
they
were
presented
to
me
at
close
range
by
a
teacher
during
the
silent
hour
which
we
were
all
required
to
observe
every
evening
and
which
was
never
broken
into
even
by
a
member
of
the
faculty
unless
the
errand
was
one
of
grave
import
i
found
these
occasional
interviews
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
more
serious
young
teachers
of
whom
i
was
extremely
fond
hard
to
endure
as
was
a
long
series
of
conversations
in
my
senior
year
conducted
by
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
members
of
the
faculty
in
which
the
desirability
of
turkey
as
a
field
for
missionary
labor
was
enticingly
put
before
me
i
suppose
i
held
myself
aloof
from
all
these
influences
partly
owing
to
the
fact
that
my
father
was
not
a
communicant
of
any
church
and
i
tremendously
admired
his
scrupulous
morality
and
sense
of
honor
in
all
matters
of
personal
and
public
conduct
and
also
because
the
little
group
to
which
i
have
referred
was
much
given
to
a
sort
of
rationalism
doubtless
founded
upon
an
early
reading
of
emerson
in
this
connection
when
bronson
alcott
came
to
lecture
at
the
school
we
all
vied
with
each
other
for
a
chance
to
do
him
a
personal
service
because
he
had
been
a
friend
of
emerson
and
we
were
inexpressibly
scornful
of
our
younger
who
cared
for
him
merely
on
the
basis
of
his
grandfatherly
relation
to
little
women
i
recall
cleaning
the
clay
of
the
unpaved
streets
off
his
heavy
cloth
overshoes
in
a
state
of
ecstatic
energy
but
i
think
in
my
case
there
were
other
factors
as
well
that
contributed
to
my
unresponsiveness
to
the
evangelical
appeal
a
curious
course
of
reading
i
had
marked
out
for
myself
in
medieval
history
seems
to
have
left
me
fascinated
by
an
ideal
of
mingled
learning
piety
and
physical
labor
more
nearly
exemplified
by
the
port
royalists
than
by
any
others
the
only
moments
in
which
i
seem
to
have
approximated
in
my
own
experience
to
a
faint
realization
of
the
beauty
of
holiness
as
i
conceived
it
was
each
sunday
morning
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
ten
when
i
went
into
the
exquisitely
neat
room
of
the
teacher
of
greek
and
read
with
her
from
a
greek
testament
we
did
this
every
sunday
morning
for
two
years
it
was
not
exactly
a
lesson
for
i
never
prepared
for
it
and
while
i
was
held
within
reasonable
bounds
of
syntax
i
was
allowed
much
more
freedom
in
translation
than
was
permitted
the
next
morning
when
i
read
homer
neither
did
we
discuss
doctrines
for
although
it
was
with
this
same
teacher
that
in
our
junior
year
we
studied
epistle
to
the
hebrews
committing
all
of
it
to
memory
and
analyzing
and
reducing
it
to
doctrines
within
an
inch
of
our
lives
we
never
allowed
an
echo
of
this
exercise
to
appear
at
these
blessed
sunday
morning
readings
it
was
as
if
the
disputations
of
paul
had
not
yet
been
for
we
always
read
from
the
gospels
the
regime
of
rockford
seminary
was
still
very
simple
in
the
each
student
made
her
own
fire
and
kept
her
own
room
in
order
sunday
morning
was
a
great
clearing
up
day
and
the
sense
of
having
made
immaculate
my
own
immediate
surroundings
the
consciousness
of
clean
linen
said
to
be
close
to
the
consciousness
of
a
clean
conscience
always
mingles
in
my
mind
with
these
early
readings
i
certainly
bore
away
with
me
a
lifelong
enthusiasm
for
reading
the
gospels
in
bulk
a
whole
one
at
a
time
and
an
insurmountable
distaste
for
having
them
cut
up
into
chapter
and
verse
or
for
hearing
the
incidents
in
that
wonderful
life
thus
referred
to
as
if
it
were
merely
a
record
my
copy
of
the
greek
testament
had
been
presented
to
me
by
the
brother
of
our
greek
teacher
professor
blaisdell
of
beloit
college
a
true
scholar
in
christian
ethics
as
his
department
was
called
i
recall
that
one
day
in
the
summer
after
i
left
college
one
of
the
black
days
which
followed
the
death
of
my
father
this
kindly
scholar
came
to
see
me
in
order
to
bring
such
comfort
as
he
might
and
to
inquire
how
far
i
had
found
solace
in
the
little
book
he
had
given
me
so
long
before
when
i
suddenly
recall
the
village
in
which
i
was
born
its
steeples
and
roofs
look
as
they
did
that
day
from
the
hilltop
where
we
talked
together
the
familiar
details
smoothed
out
and
merging
as
it
were
into
that
wide
conception
of
the
universe
which
for
the
moment
swallowed
up
my
personal
grief
or
at
least
assuaged
it
with
a
realization
that
it
was
but
a
drop
in
that
torrent
of
sorrow
and
aguish
and
terror
which
flows
under
all
the
footsteps
of
man
this
realization
of
sorrow
as
the
common
lot
of
death
as
the
universal
experience
was
the
first
comfort
which
my
bruised
spirit
had
received
in
reply
to
my
impatience
with
the
christian
doctrine
of
resignation
that
it
implied
that
you
thought
of
your
sorrow
only
in
its
effect
upon
you
and
were
disloyal
to
the
affection
itself
i
remember
how
quietly
the
christian
scholar
changed
his
phraseology
saying
that
sometimes
consolation
came
to
us
better
in
the
words
of
plato
and
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
that
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
plato
sonorous
argument
for
the
permanence
of
the
excellent
when
professor
blaisdell
returned
to
his
college
he
left
in
my
hands
a
small
copy
of
the
crito
the
greek
was
too
hard
for
me
and
i
was
speedily
driven
to
jowett
translation
that
habit
of
presenting
favorite
books
to
eager
young
people
although
it
degenerated
into
the
absurdity
of
friendship
offerings
had
much
to
be
said
for
it
when
it
indicated
the
wellsprings
of
literature
from
which
the
donor
himself
had
drawn
waters
of
healing
and
inspiration
throughout
our
school
years
we
were
always
keenly
conscious
of
the
growing
development
of
rockford
seminary
into
a
college
the
opportunity
for
our
alma
mater
to
take
her
place
in
the
new
movement
of
full
college
education
for
women
filled
us
with
enthusiasm
and
it
became
a
driving
ambition
with
the
undergraduates
to
share
in
this
new
and
glorious
undertaking
we
gravely
decided
that
it
was
important
that
some
of
the
students
should
be
ready
to
receive
the
bachelor
degree
the
very
first
moment
that
the
charter
of
the
school
should
secure
the
right
to
confer
it
two
of
us
therefore
took
a
course
in
mathematics
advanced
beyond
anything
previously
given
in
the
school
from
one
of
those
early
young
women
working
for
a
who
was
temporarily
teaching
in
rockford
that
she
might
study
more
mathematics
in
leipsic
my
companion
in
all
these
arduous
labors
has
since
accomplished
more
than
any
of
us
in
the
effort
to
procure
the
franchise
for
women
for
even
then
we
all
took
for
granted
the
righteousness
of
that
cause
into
which
i
at
least
had
merely
followed
my
conviction
in
the
spirit
of
that
cause
i
might
cite
the
career
of
this
companion
as
an
illustration
of
the
efficacy
of
higher
mathematics
for
women
for
she
possesses
singular
ability
to
convince
even
the
densest
legislators
of
their
legal
right
to
define
their
own
electorate
even
when
they
quote
against
her
the
dustiest
of
state
constitutions
or
city
charters
in
line
with
this
policy
of
placing
a
woman
college
on
an
equality
with
the
other
colleges
of
the
state
we
applied
for
an
opportunity
to
compete
in
the
intercollegiate
oratorical
contest
of
illinois
and
we
succeeded
in
having
rockford
admitted
as
the
first
woman
college
when
i
was
finally
selected
as
the
orator
i
was
somewhat
dismayed
to
find
that
representing
not
only
one
school
but
college
women
in
general
i
could
not
resent
the
brutal
frankness
with
which
my
oratorical
possibilities
were
discussed
by
the
enthusiastic
group
who
would
allow
no
personal
feeling
to
stand
in
the
way
of
progress
especially
the
progress
of
woman
cause
i
was
told
among
other
things
that
i
had
an
intolerable
habit
of
dropping
my
voice
at
the
end
of
a
sentence
in
the
most
feminine
apologetic
and
even
deprecatory
manner
which
would
probably
lose
woman
the
first
place
woman
certainly
did
lose
the
first
place
and
stood
fifth
exactly
in
the
dreary
middle
but
the
ignominious
position
may
not
have
been
solely
due
to
bad
mannerisms
for
a
prior
place
was
easily
accorded
to
william
jennings
bryan
who
not
only
thrilled
his
auditors
with
an
almost
prophetic
anticipation
of
the
cross
of
gold
but
with
a
moral
earnestness
which
we
had
mistakenly
assumed
would
be
the
unique
possession
of
the
feminine
orator
i
so
heartily
concurred
with
the
decision
of
the
judges
of
the
contest
that
it
was
with
a
mind
that
i
induced
my
colleague
and
alternate
to
remain
long
enough
in
the
athens
of
illinois
in
which
the
successful
college
was
situated
to
visit
the
state
institutions
one
for
the
blind
and
one
for
the
deaf
and
dumb
dr
gillette
was
at
that
time
head
of
the
latter
institution
his
scholarly
explanation
of
the
method
of
teaching
his
concern
for
his
charges
this
sudden
demonstration
of
the
care
the
state
bestowed
upon
its
most
unfortunate
children
filled
me
with
grave
speculations
in
which
the
first
the
fifth
or
the
ninth
place
in
the
oratorical
contest
seemed
of
little
moment
however
this
brief
delay
between
our
field
of
waterloo
and
our
arrival
at
our
aspiring
college
turned
out
to
be
most
unfortunate
for
we
found
the
ardent
group
not
only
exhausted
by
the
premature
preparations
for
the
return
of
a
successful
orator
but
naturally
much
irritated
as
they
contemplated
their
garlands
drooping
disconsolately
in
tubs
and
bowls
of
water
they
did
not
fail
to
make
me
realize
that
i
had
dealt
the
cause
of
advancement
a
staggering
blow
and
all
my
explanations
of
the
fifth
place
were
haughtily
considered
insufficient
before
that
golden
bar
of
youth
so
absurdly
inflexible
to
return
to
my
last
year
of
school
it
was
inevitable
that
the
pressure
toward
religious
profession
should
increase
as
graduating
day
approached
so
curious
however
are
the
paths
of
moral
development
that
several
times
during
subsequent
experiences
have
i
felt
that
this
passive
resistance
of
mine
this
clinging
to
an
individual
conviction
was
the
best
moral
training
i
received
at
rockford
college
during
the
first
decade
of
it
was
felt
by
propagandists
of
diverse
social
theories
that
the
new
settlement
would
be
a
fine
coign
of
vantage
from
which
to
propagate
social
faiths
and
that
a
mere
preliminary
step
would
be
the
conversion
of
the
founders
hence
i
have
been
reasoned
with
hours
at
a
time
and
i
recall
at
least
three
occasions
when
this
was
followed
by
actual
prayer
in
the
first
instance
the
honest
exhorter
who
fell
upon
his
knees
before
my
astonished
eyes
was
an
advocate
of
single
tax
upon
land
values
he
begged
in
that
phraseology
which
is
deemed
appropriate
for
prayer
that
the
sister
might
see
the
beneficent
results
it
would
bring
to
the
poor
who
live
in
the
awful
congested
districts
around
this
very
house
the
early
socialists
used
every
method
of
attack
a
favorite
one
being
the
statement
doubtless
sometimes
honestly
made
that
i
really
was
a
socialist
but
too
much
of
a
coward
to
say
so
i
remember
one
socialist
who
habitually
opened
a
very
telling
address
he
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
upon
the
street
corners
by
holding
me
up
as
an
awful
example
to
his
fellow
socialists
as
one
of
their
number
who
had
been
caught
in
the
toils
of
capitalism
he
always
added
as
a
final
clinching
of
the
statement
that
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
men
club
when
i
ventured
to
say
to
him
that
not
all
of
the
thousands
of
people
who
belong
to
a
class
or
club
at
could
possibly
know
my
personal
opinions
and
to
mildly
inquire
upon
what
he
founded
his
assertions
he
triumphantly
replied
that
i
had
once
admitted
to
him
that
i
had
read
sombart
and
loria
and
that
anyone
of
sound
mind
must
see
the
inevitable
conclusions
of
such
master
reasonings
i
could
multiply
these
two
instances
a
hundredfold
and
possibly
nothing
aided
me
to
stand
on
my
own
feet
and
to
select
what
seemed
reasonable
from
this
wilderness
of
dogma
so
much
as
my
early
encounter
with
genuine
zeal
and
affectionate
solicitude
associated
with
what
i
could
not
accept
as
the
whole
truth
i
do
not
wish
to
take
callow
writing
too
seriously
but
i
reproduce
from
an
oratorical
contest
the
following
bit
of
premature
pragmatism
doubtless
due
much
more
to
temperament
than
to
perception
because
i
am
still
ready
to
subscribe
to
it
although
the
grandiloquent
style
is
i
hope
a
thing
of
the
past
those
who
believe
that
justice
is
but
a
poetical
longing
within
us
the
enthusiast
who
thinks
it
will
come
in
the
form
of
a
millennium
those
who
see
it
established
by
the
strong
arm
of
a
hero
are
not
those
who
have
comprehended
the
vast
truths
of
life
the
actual
justice
must
come
by
trained
intelligence
by
broadened
sympathies
toward
the
individual
man
or
woman
who
crosses
our
path
one
item
added
to
another
is
the
only
method
by
which
to
build
up
a
conception
lofty
enough
to
be
of
use
in
the
world
this
schoolgirl
recipe
has
been
tested
in
many
later
experiences
the
most
dramatic
of
which
came
when
i
was
called
upon
by
a
manufacturing
company
to
act
as
one
of
three
arbitrators
in
a
perplexing
struggle
between
themselves
a
group
of
and
a
employee
of
their
establishment
the
man
who
was
the
cause
of
the
difficulty
had
ten
years
before
sided
with
his
employers
in
a
prolonged
strike
and
had
bitterly
fought
the
union
he
had
been
so
badly
injured
at
that
time
that
in
spite
of
long
months
of
hospital
care
he
had
never
afterward
been
able
to
do
a
full
day
work
although
his
employers
had
retained
him
for
a
decade
at
full
pay
in
recognition
of
his
loyalty
at
the
end
of
ten
years
the
once
defeated
union
was
strong
enough
to
enforce
its
demands
for
a
union
shop
and
in
spite
of
the
distaste
of
the
firm
for
the
arrangement
no
obstacle
to
harmonious
relations
with
the
union
remained
but
for
the
refusal
of
the
to
receive
as
one
of
their
members
the
old
crippled
employee
whose
spirit
was
broken
as
last
and
who
was
now
willing
to
join
the
union
and
to
stand
with
his
old
enemies
for
the
sake
of
retaining
his
place
but
the
union
men
would
not
receive
a
traitor
the
firm
flatly
refused
to
dismiss
so
faithful
an
employee
the
busy
season
was
upon
them
and
everyone
concerned
had
finally
agreed
to
abide
without
appeal
by
the
decision
of
the
arbitrators
the
chairman
of
our
little
arbitration
committee
a
venerable
judge
quickly
demonstrated
that
it
was
impossible
to
collect
trustworthy
evidence
in
regards
to
the
events
already
ten
years
old
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
this
bitterness
and
we
soon
therefore
ceased
to
interview
the
conflicting
witnesses
the
second
member
of
the
committee
sternly
bade
the
men
remember
that
the
most
ancient
hebraic
authority
gave
no
sanction
for
holding
even
a
just
resentment
for
more
than
seven
years
and
at
last
we
all
settled
down
to
that
wearisome
effort
to
secure
the
inner
consent
of
all
concerned
upon
which
alone
the
mystery
of
justice
as
maeterlinck
has
told
us
ultimately
depends
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
in
the
end
we
administered
justice
but
certainly
employers
and
arbitrators
were
all
convinced
that
justice
will
have
to
be
established
in
industrial
affairs
with
the
same
care
and
patience
which
has
been
necessary
for
centuries
in
order
to
institute
it
in
men
civic
relationships
although
as
the
judge
remarked
the
search
must
be
conducted
without
much
help
from
precedent
the
conviction
remained
with
me
that
however
long
a
time
might
be
required
to
establish
justice
in
the
new
relationships
of
our
raw
industrialism
it
would
never
be
stable
until
it
had
received
the
sanction
of
those
upon
whom
the
present
situation
presses
so
harshly
towards
the
end
of
our
four
years
course
we
debated
much
as
to
what
we
were
to
be
and
long
before
the
end
of
my
school
days
it
was
quite
settled
in
my
mind
that
i
should
study
medicine
and
live
with
the
poor
this
conclusion
of
course
was
the
result
of
many
things
perhaps
epitomized
in
my
graduating
essay
on
cassandra
and
her
tragic
fate
always
to
be
in
the
right
and
always
to
be
disbelieved
and
rejected
this
state
of
affairs
it
may
readily
be
guessed
the
essay
held
to
be
an
example
of
the
feminine
trait
of
mind
called
intuition
an
accurate
perception
of
truth
and
justice
which
rests
contented
in
itself
and
will
make
no
effort
to
confirm
itself
or
to
organize
through
existing
knowledge
the
essay
then
proceeds
i
am
forced
to
admit
with
overmuch
conviction
with
the
statement
that
women
can
only
grow
accurate
and
intelligible
by
the
thorough
study
of
at
least
one
branch
of
physical
science
for
only
with
eyes
thus
accustomed
to
the
search
for
truth
can
she
detect
all
and
fancy
in
herself
and
learn
to
express
herself
without
dogmatism
so
much
for
the
first
part
of
the
thesis
having
thus
gained
accuracy
would
woman
bring
this
force
to
bear
throughout
morals
and
justice
then
she
must
find
in
active
labor
the
promptings
and
inspirations
that
come
from
growing
insight
i
was
quite
certain
that
by
following
these
directions
carefully
in
the
end
the
contemporary
woman
would
find
her
faculties
clear
and
acute
from
the
study
of
science
and
her
hand
upon
the
magnetic
chain
of
humanity
this
veneration
for
science
portrayed
in
my
final
essay
was
doubtless
the
result
of
the
statements
the
textbooks
were
then
making
of
what
was
called
the
theory
of
evolution
the
acceptance
of
which
even
thirty
years
after
the
publication
of
origin
of
species
had
about
it
a
touch
of
intellectual
adventure
we
knew
for
instance
that
our
science
teacher
had
accepted
this
theory
but
we
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
the
teacher
of
butler
analogy
had
not
we
chafed
at
the
meagerness
of
the
college
library
in
this
direction
and
i
used
to
bring
back
in
my
handbag
books
belonging
to
an
advanced
who
had
studied
medicine
in
germany
and
who
therefore
was
quite
emancipated
the
first
gift
i
made
when
i
came
into
possession
of
my
small
estate
the
year
after
i
left
school
was
a
thousand
dollars
to
the
library
of
rockford
college
with
the
stipulation
that
it
be
spent
for
scientific
books
in
the
long
vacations
i
pressed
plants
stuffed
birds
and
pounded
rocks
in
some
vague
belief
that
i
was
approximating
the
new
method
and
yet
when
my
stepbrother
who
was
becoming
a
real
scientist
tried
to
carry
me
along
with
him
to
the
merest
outskirts
of
the
methods
of
research
it
at
once
became
evident
that
i
had
no
aptitude
and
was
unable
to
follow
intelligently
careful
observations
on
the
earthworm
i
made
a
heroic
effort
although
candor
compels
me
to
state
that
i
never
would
have
finished
if
i
had
not
been
pulled
and
pushed
by
my
really
ardent
companion
who
in
addition
to
a
multitude
of
earthworms
and
a
fine
microscope
possessed
untiring
tact
with
one
of
flagging
zeal
as
our
days
neared
the
end
in
the
consciousness
of
approaching
separation
we
vowed
eternal
allegiance
to
our
early
ideals
and
promised
each
other
we
would
never
abandon
them
without
conscious
justification
and
we
often
warned
each
other
of
the
perils
of
we
believed
in
our
sublime
that
the
difficulty
of
life
would
lie
solely
in
the
direction
of
losing
these
precious
ideals
of
ours
of
failing
to
follow
the
way
of
martyrdom
and
high
purpose
we
had
marked
out
for
ourselves
and
we
had
no
notion
of
the
obscure
paths
of
tolerance
just
allowance
and
wherein
if
we
held
our
minds
open
we
might
learn
something
of
the
mystery
and
complexity
of
life
purposes
the
year
after
i
had
left
college
i
came
back
with
a
classmate
to
receive
the
degree
we
had
so
eagerly
anticipated
two
of
the
graduating
class
were
also
ready
and
four
of
us
were
dubbed
on
the
very
day
that
rockford
seminary
was
declared
a
college
in
the
midst
of
tumultuous
anticipations
having
had
a
year
outside
of
college
walls
in
that
trying
land
between
vague
hope
and
definite
attainment
i
had
become
very
much
sobered
in
my
desire
for
a
degree
and
was
already
beginning
to
emerge
from
that
mist
with
which
the
dream
of
youth
so
readily
envelops
the
future
whatever
may
have
been
the
perils
of
i
certainly
did
not
escape
them
for
it
required
eight
years
from
the
time
i
left
rockford
in
the
summer
of
until
was
opened
in
the
the
autumn
of
to
formulate
my
convictions
even
in
the
least
satisfactory
manner
much
less
to
reduce
them
to
a
plan
for
action
during
most
of
that
time
i
was
absolutely
at
sea
so
far
as
any
moral
purpose
was
concerned
clinging
only
to
the
desire
to
live
in
a
really

world

refusing
to
be
content

shadowy
intellectual
or

weir
mitchell
hospital
for
the
late
spring
and
the
next
winter
i
was
literally
bound
to
a
bed
in
my
sister
house
for
six
months
in
spite
of
its
tedium
the
long
winter
had
its
mitigations
for
after
the
first
few
weeks
i
was
able
to
read
with
a
luxurious
consciousness
of
leisure
and
i
remember
opening
the
first
volume
of
carlyle
frederick
the
great
with
a
lively
sense
of
gratitude
that
it
was
not
gray
anatomy
having
found
like
many
another
that
general
culture
is
a
much
easier
undertaking
than
professional
study
the
long
illness
inevitably
put
aside
the
immediate
prosecution
of
a
medical
course
and
although
i
had
passed
my
examinations
creditably
enough
in
the
required
subjects
for
the
first
year
i
was
very
glad
to
have
a
physician
sanction
for
giving
up
clinics
and
dissecting
rooms
and
to
follow
his
prescription
of
spending
the
next
two
years
in
europe
before
i
returned
to
america
i
had
discovered
that
there
were
other
genuine
reasons
for
living
among
the
poor
than
that
of
practicing
medicine
upon
them
and
my
brief
foray
into
the
profession
was
never
resumed
the
long
illness
left
me
in
a
state
of
nervous
exhaustion
with
which
i
struggled
for
years
traces
of
it
remaining
long
after
was
opened
in
at
the
best
it
allowed
me
but
a
limited
amount
of
energy
so
that
doubtless
there
was
much
nervous
depression
at
the
foundation
of
the
spiritual
struggles
which
this
chapter
is
forced
to
record
however
it
could
not
have
been
all
due
to
my
health
for
as
my
wise
little
notebook
sententiously
remarked
in
his
own
way
each
man
must
struggle
lest
the
moral
law
become
a
abstraction
utterly
separated
from
his
active
life
it
would
of
course
be
impossible
to
remember
that
some
of
these
struggles
ever
took
place
at
all
were
it
not
for
these
selfsame
notebooks
in
which
however
i
no
longer
wrote
in
moments
of
high
resolve
but
judging
from
the
internal
evidence
afforded
by
the
books
themselves
only
in
moments
of
deep
depression
when
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
failure
one
of
the
most
poignant
of
these
experiences
which
occurred
during
the
first
few
months
after
our
landing
upon
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
was
on
a
saturday
night
when
i
received
an
ineradicable
impression
of
the
wretchedness
of
east
london
and
also
saw
for
the
first
time
the
overcrowded
quarters
of
a
great
city
at
midnight
a
small
party
of
tourists
were
taken
to
the
east
end
by
a
city
missionary
to
witness
the
saturday
night
sale
of
decaying
vegetables
and
fruit
which
owing
to
the
sunday
laws
in
london
could
not
be
sold
until
monday
and
as
they
were
beyond
safe
keeping
were
disposed
of
at
auction
as
late
as
possible
on
saturday
night
on
mile
end
road
from
the
top
of
an
omnibus
which
paused
at
the
end
of
a
dingy
street
lighted
by
only
occasional
flares
of
gas
we
saw
two
huge
masses
of
people
clamoring
around
two
hucksters
carts
they
were
bidding
their
farthings
and
for
a
vegetable
held
up
by
the
auctioneer
which
he
at
last
scornfully
flung
with
a
gibe
for
its
cheapness
to
the
successful
bidder
in
the
momentary
pause
only
one
man
detached
himself
from
the
groups
he
had
bidden
in
a
cabbage
and
when
it
struck
his
hand
he
instantly
sat
down
on
the
curb
tore
it
with
his
teeth
and
hastily
devoured
it
unwashed
and
uncooked
as
it
was
he
and
his
fellows
were
types
of
the
submerged
tenth
as
our
missionary
guide
told
us
with
some
little
satisfaction
in
the
then
new
phrase
and
he
further
added
that
so
many
of
them
could
scarcely
be
seen
in
one
spot
save
at
this
saturday
night
auction
the
desire
for
cheap
food
being
apparently
the
one
thing
which
could
move
them
simultaneously
they
were
huddled
into
clothing
the
ragged
finery
which
one
sees
only
in
east
london
their
pale
faces
were
dominated
by
that
most
unlovely
of
human
expressions
the
cunning
and
shrewdness
of
the
who
starves
if
he
can
not
make
a
successful
trade
and
yet
the
final
impression
was
not
of
ragged
tawdry
clothing
nor
of
pinched
and
sallow
faces
but
of
myriads
of
hands
empty
pathetic
nerveless
and
workworn
showing
white
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
street
and
clutching
forward
for
food
which
was
already
unfit
to
eat
perhaps
nothing
is
so
fraught
with
significance
as
the
human
hand
this
oldest
tool
with
which
man
has
dug
his
way
from
savagery
and
with
which
he
is
constantly
groping
forward
i
have
never
since
been
able
to
see
a
number
of
hands
held
upward
even
when
they
are
moving
rhythmically
in
a
calisthenic
exercise
or
when
they
belong
to
a
class
of
chubby
children
who
wave
them
in
eager
response
to
a
teacher
query
without
a
certain
revival
of
this
memory
a
clutching
at
the
heart
reminiscent
of
the
despair
and
resentment
which
seized
me
then
for
the
following
weeks
i
went
about
london
almost
furtively
afraid
to
look
down
narrow
streets
and
alleys
lest
they
disclose
again
this
hideous
human
need
and
suffering
i
carried
with
me
for
days
at
a
time
that
curious
surprise
we
experience
when
we
first
come
back
into
the
streets
after
days
given
over
to
sorrow
and
death
we
are
bewildered
that
the
world
should
be
going
on
as
usual
and
unable
to
determine
which
is
real
the
inner
pang
or
the
outward
seeming
in
time
all
huge
london
came
to
seem
unreal
save
the
poverty
in
its
east
end
during
the
following
two
years
on
the
continent
while
i
was
irresistibly
drawn
to
the
poorer
quarters
of
each
city
nothing
among
the
beggars
of
south
italy
nor
among
the
salt
miners
of
austria
carried
with
it
the
same
conviction
of
human
wretchedness
which
was
conveyed
by
this
momentary
glimpse
of
an
east
london
street
it
was
of
course
a
most
fragmentary
and
lurid
view
of
the
poverty
of
east
london
and
quite
unfair
i
should
have
been
shown
either
less
or
more
for
i
went
away
with
no
notion
of
the
hundreds
of
men
and
women
who
had
gallantly
identified
their
fortunes
with
these
people
and
who
in
church
and
chapel
relief
works
and
charities
were
at
least
making
an
effort
towards
its
mitigation
our
visit
was
made
in
november
the
very
year
when
the
pall
mall
gazette
exposure
started
the
bitter
cry
of
outcast
london
and
the
conscience
of
england
was
stirred
as
never
before
over
this
joyless
city
in
the
east
end
of
its
capital
even
then
vigorous
and
drastic
plans
were
being
discussed
and
a
splendid
program
of
municipal
reforms
was
already
dimly
outlined
of
all
these
however
i
had
heard
nothing
but
the
vaguest
rumor
no
comfort
came
to
me
then
from
any
source
and
the
painful
impression
was
increased
because
at
the
very
moment
of
looking
down
the
east
london
street
from
the
top
of
the
omnibus
i
had
been
sharply
and
painfully
reminded
of
the
vision
of
sudden
death
which
had
confronted
de
quincey
one
summer
night
as
he
was
being
driven
through
rural
england
on
a
high
mail
coach
two
absorbed
lovers
suddenly
appear
between
the
narrow
blossoming
hedgerows
in
the
direct
path
of
the
huge
vehicle
which
is
sure
to
crush
them
to
their
death
de
quincey
tries
to
send
them
a
warning
shout
but
finds
himself
unable
to
make
a
sound
because
his
mind
is
hopelessly
entangled
in
an
endeavor
to
recall
the
exact
lines
from
the
iliad
which
describe
the
great
cry
with
which
achilles
alarmed
all
asia
militant
only
after
his
memory
responds
is
his
will
released
from
its
momentary
paralysis
and
he
rides
on
through
the
fragrant
night
with
the
horror
of
the
escaped
calamity
thick
upon
him
but
he
also
bears
with
him
the
consciousness
that
he
had
given
himself
over
so
many
years
to
classic
learning
that
when
suddenly
called
upon
for
a
quick
decision
in
the
world
of
life
and
death
he
had
been
able
to
act
only
through
a
literary
suggestion
this
is
what
we
were
all
doing
lumbering
our
minds
with
literature
that
only
served
to
cloud
the
really
vital
situation
spread
before
our
eyes
it
seemed
to
me
too
preposterous
that
in
my
first
view
of
the
horror
of
east
london
i
should
have
recalled
de
quincey
literary
description
of
the
literary
suggestion
which
had
once
paralyzed
him
in
my
disgust
it
all
appeared
a
hateful
vicious
circle
which
even
the
apostles
of
culture
themselves
admitted
for
had
not
one
of
the
greatest
among
the
moderns
plainly
said
that
conduct
and
not
culture
is
three
fourths
of
human
life
for
two
years
in
the
midst
of
my
distress
over
the
poverty
which
thus
suddenly
driven
into
my
consciousness
had
become
to
me
the
weltschmerz
there
was
mingled
a
sense
of
futility
of
misdirected
energy
the
belief
that
the
pursuit
of
cultivation
would
not
in
the
end
bring
either
solace
or
relief
i
gradually
reached
a
conviction
that
the
first
generation
of
college
women
had
taken
their
learning
too
quickly
had
departed
too
suddenly
from
the
active
emotional
life
led
by
their
grandmothers
and
that
the
contemporary
education
of
young
women
had
developed
too
exclusively
the
power
of
acquiring
knowledge
and
of
merely
receiving
impressions
that
somewhere
in
the
process
of
educated
they
had
lost
that
simple
and
almost
automatic
response
to
the
human
appeal
that
old
healthful
reaction
resulting
in
activity
from
the
mere
presence
of
suffering
or
of
helplessness
that
they
are
so
sheltered
and
pampered
they
have
no
chance
even
to
make
the
great
refusal
in
the
german
and
french
pensions
which
years
ago
were
crowded
with
american
mothers
and
their
daughters
who
had
crossed
the
seas
in
search
of
culture
one
often
found
the
mother
making
real
connection
with
the
life
about
her
using
her
inadequate
german
with
great
fluency
gaily
measuring
the
enormous
sheets
or
exchanging
recipes
with
the
german
hausfrau
visiting
impartially
the
nearest
kindergarten
and
market
making
an
atmosphere
of
her
own
hearty
and
genuine
as
far
as
it
went
in
the
house
and
on
the
street
on
the
other
hand
her
daughter
was
critical
and
uncertain
of
her
linguistic
acquirements
and
only
at
ease
when
in
the
familiar
receptive
attitude
afforded
by
the
art
gallery
and
opera
house
in
the
latter
she
was
swayed
and
moved
appreciative
of
the
power
and
charm
of
the
music
intelligent
as
to
the
legend
and
poetry
of
the
plot
finding
use
for
her
trained
and
developed
powers
as
she
sat
being
cultivated
in
the
familiar
atmosphere
of
the
classroom
which
had
as
it
were
become
sublimated
and
romanticized
i
remember
a
happy
busy
mother
who
complacent
with
the
knowledge
that
her
daughter
daily
devoted
four
hours
to
her
music
looked
up
from
her
knitting
to
say
if
i
had
had
your
opportunities
when
i
was
young
my
dear
i
should
have
been
a
very
happy
girl
i
always
had
musical
talent
but
such
training
as
i
had
foolish
little
songs
and
waltzes
and
not
time
for
half
an
hour
practice
a
day
the
mother
did
not
dream
of
the
sting
her
words
left
and
that
the
sensitive
girl
appreciated
only
too
well
that
her
opportunities
were
fine
and
unusual
but
she
also
knew
that
in
spite
of
some
facility
and
much
good
teaching
she
had
no
genuine
talent
and
never
would
fulfill
the
expectations
of
her
friends
she
looked
back
upon
her
mother
girlhood
with
positive
envy
because
it
was
so
full
of
happy
industry
and
extenuating
obstacles
with
undisturbed
opportunity
to
believe
that
her
talents
were
unusual
the
girl
looked
wistfully
at
her
mother
but
had
not
the
courage
to
cry
out
what
was
in
her
heart
i
might
believe
i
had
unusual
talent
if
i
did
not
know
what
good
music
was
i
might
enjoy
half
an
hour
practice
a
day
if
i
were
busy
and
happy
the
rest
of
the
time
you
do
not
know
what
life
means
when
all
the
difficulties
are
removed
i
am
simply
smothered
and
sickened
with
advantages
it
is
like
eating
a
sweet
dessert
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
this
then
was
the
difficulty
this
sweet
dessert
in
the
morning
and
the
assumption
that
the
sheltered
educated
girl
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bitter
poverty
and
the
social
maladjustment
which
is
all
about
her
and
which
after
all
can
not
be
concealed
for
it
breaks
through
poetry
and
literature
in
a
burning
tide
which
overwhelms
her
it
peers
at
her
in
the
form
of
market
women
and
underpaid
street
laborers
gibing
her
with
a
sense
of
her
uselessness
i
recall
one
snowy
morning
in
looking
from
the
window
of
our
little
hotel
upon
the
town
square
that
we
saw
crossing
and
recrossing
it
a
single
file
of
women
with
semicircular
heavy
wooden
tanks
fastened
upon
their
backs
they
were
carrying
in
this
primitive
fashion
to
a
remote
cooling
room
these
tanks
filled
with
a
hot
brew
incident
to
one
stage
of
beer
making
the
women
were
bent
forward
not
only
under
the
weight
which
they
were
bearing
but
because
the
tanks
were
so
high
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
have
lifted
their
heads
their
faces
and
hands
reddened
in
the
cold
morning
air
showed
clearly
the
white
scars
where
they
had
previously
been
scalded
by
the
hot
stuff
which
splashed
if
they
stumbled
ever
so
little
on
their
way
stung
into
action
by
one
of
those
sudden
indignations
against
cruel
conditions
which
at
times
fill
the
young
with
unexpected
energy
i
found
myself
across
the
square
in
company
with
mine
host
interviewing
the
phlegmatic
owner
of
the
brewery
who
received
us
with
exasperating
indifference
or
rather
received
me
for
the
innkeeper
mysteriously
slunk
away
as
soon
as
the
great
magnate
of
the
town
began
to
speak
i
went
back
to
a
breakfast
for
which
i
had
lost
my
appetite
as
i
had
for
gray
life
of
prince
albert
and
his
wonderful
tutor
baron
stockmar
which
i
had
been
reading
late
the
night
before
the
book
had
lost
its
fascination
how
could
a
good
man
feeling
so
keenly
his
obligation
to
make
princely
the
mind
of
his
prince
ignore
such
conditions
of
life
for
the
multitude
of
humble
folk
we
were
spending
two
months
in
dresden
that
winter
given
over
to
much
reading
of
the
history
of
art
and
after
such
an
experience
i
would
invariably
suffer
a
moral
revulsion
against
this
feverish
search
after
culture
it
was
doubtless
in
such
moods
that
i
founded
my
admiration
for
albrecht
durer
taking
his
wonderful
pictures
however
in
the
most
unorthodox
manner
merely
as
human
documents
i
was
chiefly
appealed
to
by
his
unwillingness
to
lend
himself
to
a
smooth
and
cultivated
view
of
life
by
his
determination
to
record
its
frustrations
and
even
the
hideous
forms
which
darken
the
day
for
our
human
imagination
and
to
ignore
no
human
complications
i
believed
that
his
canvases
intimated
the
coming
religious
and
social
changes
of
the
reformation
and
the
peasants
wars
that
they
were
surcharged
with
pity
for
the
downtrodden
that
his
sad
knights
gravely
standing
guard
were
longing
to
avert
that
shedding
of
blood
which
is
sure
to
occur
when
men
forget
how
complicated
life
is
and
insist
upon
reducing
it
to
logical
dogmas
the
largest
sum
of
money
that
i
ever
ventured
to
spend
in
europe
was
for
an
engraving
of
his
hubert
the
background
of
which
was
said
to
be
from
an
original
durer
plate
there
is
little
doubt
i
am
afraid
that
the
background
as
well
as
the
figures
were
put
in
at
a
later
date
but
the
purchase
at
least
registered
the
mark
of
my
enthusiasm
the
wonder
and
beauty
of
italy
later
brought
healing
and
some
relief
to
the
paralyzing
sense
of
the
futility
of
all
artistic
and
intellectual
effort
when
disconnected
from
the
ultimate
test
of
the
conduct
it
inspired
the
serene
and
soothing
touch
of
history
also
aroused
old
enthusiasms
although
some
of
their
manifestations
were
such
as
one
smiles
over
more
easily
in
retrospection
than
at
the
moment
i
fancy
that
it
was
no
smiling
matter
to
several
people
in
our
party
whom
i
induced
to
walk
for
three
miles
in
the
hot
sunshine
beating
down
upon
the
roman
campagna
that
we
might
enter
the
eternal
city
on
foot
through
the
porta
del
popolo
as
pilgrims
had
done
for
centuries
to
be
sure
we
had
really
entered
rome
the
night
before
but
the
railroad
station
and
the
hotel
might
have
been
anywhere
else
and
we
had
been
driven
beyond
the
walls
after
breakfast
and
stranded
at
the
very
spot
where
the
pilgrims
always
said
ecco
roma
as
they
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
peter
dome
this
melodramatic
entrance
into
rome
or
rather
pretended
entrance
was
the
prelude
to
days
of
enchantment
and
i
returned
to
europe
two
years
later
in
order
to
spend
a
winter
there
and
to
carry
out
a
great
desire
to
systematically
study
the
catacombs
in
spite
of
my
distrust
of
advantages
i
was
apparently
not
yet
so
cured
but
that
i
wanted
more
of
them
the
two
years
which
elapsed
before
i
again
found
myself
in
europe
brought
their
inevitable
changes
family
arrangements
had
so
come
about
that
i
had
spent
three
or
four
months
of
each
of
the
intervening
winters
in
baltimore
where
i
seemed
to
have
reached
the
nadir
of
my
nervous
depression
and
sense
of
maladjustment
in
spite
of
my
interest
in
the
fascinating
lectures
given
there
by
lanciani
of
rome
and
a
definite
course
of
reading
under
the
guidance
of
a
johns
hopkins
lecturer
upon
the
united
italy
movement
in
the
latter
i
naturally
encountered
the
influence
of
mazzini
which
was
a
source
of
great
comfort
to
me
although
perhaps
i
went
too
suddenly
from
a
contemplation
of
his
wonderful
ethical
and
philosophical
appeal
to
the
workingmen
of
italy
directly
to
the
lecture
rooms
at
johns
hopkins
university
for
i
was
certainly
much
disillusioned
at
this
time
as
to
the
effect
of
intellectual
pursuits
upon
moral
development
the
summers
were
spent
in
the
old
home
in
northern
illinois
and
one
sunday
morning
i
received
the
rite
of
baptism
and
became
a
member
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
village
at
this
time
there
was
certainly
no
outside
pressure
pushing
me
towards
such
a
decision
and
at
one
does
not
ordinarily
take
such
a
step
from
a
mere
desire
to
conform
while
i
was
not
conscious
of
any
emotional
conversion
i
took
upon
myself
the
outward
expressions
of
the
religious
life
with
all
humility
and
sincerity
it
was
doubtless
true
that
i
was
weary
of
myself
and
sick
of
asking
what
i
am
and
what
i
ought
to
be
and
that
various
cherished
safeguards
and
claims
to
had
been
broken
into
by
many
piteous
failures
but
certainly
i
had
been
brought
to
the
conclusion
that
sincerely
to
give
up
one
conceit
or
hope
of
being
good
in
one
own
right
is
the
only
door
to
the
universe
deeper
reaches
perhaps
the
young
clergyman
recognized
this
as
the
test
of
the
christian
temper
at
any
rate
he
required
little
assent
to
dogma
or
miracle
and
assured
me
that
while
both
the
ministry
and
the
officers
of
his
church
were
obliged
to
subscribe
to
doctrines
of
severity
the
faith
required
to
the
laity
was
almost
early
christian
in
its
simplicity
i
was
conscious
of
no
change
from
my
childish
acceptance
of
the
teachings
of
the
gospels
but
at
this
moment
something
persuasive
within
made
me
long
for
an
outward
symbol
of
fellowship
some
bond
of
peace
some
blessed
spot
where
unity
of
spirit
might
claim
right
of
way
over
all
differences
there
was
also
growing
within
me
an
almost
passionate
devotion
to
the
ideals
of
democracy
and
when
in
all
history
had
these
ideals
been
so
thrillingly
expressed
as
when
the
faith
of
the
fisherman
and
the
slave
had
been
boldly
opposed
to
the
accepted
moral
belief
that
the
of
a
privileged
few
might
justly
be
built
upon
the
ignorance
and
sacrifice
of
the
many
who
was
i
with
my
dreams
of
universal
fellowship
that
i
did
not
identify
myself
with
the
institutional
statement
of
this
belief
as
it
stood
in
the
little
village
in
which
i
was
born
and
without
which
testimony
in
each
remote
hamlet
of
christendom
it
would
be
so
easy
for
the
world
to
slip
back
into
the
doctrines
of
selection
and
aristocracy
in
one
of
the
intervening
summers
between
these
european
journeys
i
visited
a
western
state
where
i
had
formerly
invested
a
sum
of
money
in
mortgages
i
was
much
horrified
by
the
wretched
conditions
among
the
farmers
which
had
resulted
from
a
long
period
of
drought
and
one
forlorn
picture
was
fairly
burned
into
my
mind
a
number
of
starved
hogs
collateral
for
a
promissory
note
were
huddled
into
an
open
pen
their
backs
were
humped
in
a
curious
fashion
and
they
were
devouring
one
of
their
own
number
the
latest
victim
of
absolute
starvation
or
possibly
merely
the
one
least
able
to
defend
himself
against
their
voracious
hunger
the
farmer
wife
looked
on
indifferently
a
picture
of
despair
as
she
stood
in
the
door
of
the
bare
crude
house
and
the
two
children
behind
her
whom
she
vainly
tried
to
keep
out
of
sight
continually
thrust
forward
their
faces
almost
covered
by
masses
of
coarse
sunburned
hair
and
their
little
bare
feet
so
black
so
hard
the
great
cracks
so
filled
with
dust
that
they
looked
like
flattened
hoofs
the
children
could
not
be
compared
to
anything
so
joyous
as
satyrs
although
they
appeared
but
it
seemed
to
me
quite
impossible
to
receive
interest
from
mortgages
placed
upon
farms
which
might
at
any
season
be
reduced
to
such
conditions
and
with
great
inconvenience
to
my
agent
and
doubtless
with
hardship
to
the
farmers
as
speedily
as
possible
i
withdrew
all
my
investment
but
something
had
to
be
done
with
the
money
and
in
my
reaction
against
unseen
horrors
i
bought
a
farm
near
my
native
village
and
also
a
flock
of
sheep
my
partner
in
the
enterprise
had
not
chosen
the
shepherd
lot
as
a
permanent
occupation
but
hoped
to
speedily
finish
his
college
course
upon
half
the
proceeds
of
our
venture
this
pastoral
enterprise
still
seems
to
me
to
have
been
essentially
sound
both
economically
and
morally
but
perhaps
one
partner
depended
too
much
upon
the
impeccability
of
her
motives
and
the
other
found
himself
too
preoccupied
with
study
to
know
that
it
is
not
a
real
kindness
to
bed
a
sheepfold
with
straw
for
certainly
the
venture
ended
in
a
spectacle
scarcely
less
harrowing
than
the
memory
it
was
designed
to
obliterate
at
least
the
sight
of
two
hundred
sheep
with
four
rotting
hoofs
each
was
not
reassuring
to
one
whose
conscience
craved
economic
peace
a
fortunate
series
of
sales
of
mutton
wool
and
farm
enabled
the
partners
to
end
the
enterprise
without
loss
and
they
passed
on
one
to
college
and
the
other
to
europe
if
not
wiser
certainly
sadder
for
the
experience
it
was
during
this
second
journey
to
europe
that
i
attended
a
meeting
of
the
london
match
girls
who
were
on
strike
and
who
met
daily
under
the
leadership
of
labor
men
of
london
the
low
wages
that
were
reported
at
the
meetings
the
phossy
jaw
which
was
described
and
occasionally
exhibited
the
appearance
of
the
girls
themselves
i
did
not
curiously
enough
in
any
wise
connect
with
what
was
called
the
labor
movement
nor
did
i
understand
the
efforts
of
the
london
concerning
whom
i
held
the
vaguest
notions
but
of
course
this
impression
of
human
misery
was
added
to
the
others
which
were
already
making
me
so
wretched
i
think
that
up
to
this
time
i
was
still
filled
with
the
sense
which
wells
describes
in
one
of
his
young
characters
that
somewhere
in
church
or
state
are
a
body
of
authoritative
people
who
will
put
things
to
rights
as
soon
as
they
really
know
what
is
wrong
such
a
young
person
persistently
believes
that
behind
all
suffering
behind
sin
and
want
must
lie
redeeming
magnanimity
he
may
imagine
the
world
to
be
tragic
and
terrible
but
it
never
for
an
instant
occurs
to
him
that
it
may
be
contemptible
or
squalid
or
apparently
i
looked
upon
the
efforts
of
the
as
i
did
upon
those
of
frederic
harrison
and
the
positivists
whom
i
heard
the
next
sunday
in
newton
hall
as
a
manifestation
of
loyalty
to
humanity
and
an
attempt
to
aid
in
its
progress
i
was
enormously
interested
in
the
positivists
during
these
european
years
i
imagined
that
their
philosophical
conception
of
religious
development
might
include
all
expressions
of
that
for
which
so
many
ages
of
men
have
struggled
and
aspired
i
vaguely
hoped
for
this
universal
comity
when
i
stood
in
stonehenge
on
the
acropolis
in
athens
or
in
the
sistine
chapel
in
the
vatican
but
never
did
i
so
desire
it
as
in
the
cathedrals
of
winchester
notre
dame
amiens
one
winter
day
i
traveled
from
munich
to
ulm
because
i
imagined
from
what
the
art
books
said
that
the
cathedral
hoarded
a
medieval
statement
of
the
positivists
final
synthesis
prefiguring
their
conception
of
a
supreme
humanity
in
this
i
was
not
altogether
disappointed
the
religious
history
carved
on
the
choir
stalls
at
ulm
contained
greek
philosophers
as
well
as
hebrew
prophets
and
among
the
disciples
and
saints
stood
the
discoverer
of
music
and
a
builder
of
pagan
temples
even
then
i
was
startled
forgetting
for
the
moment
the
religious
revolutions
of
south
germany
to
catch
sight
of
a
window
showing
luther
as
he
affixed
his
thesis
on
the
door
at
wittenberg
the
picture
shining
clear
in
the
midst
of
the
older
glass
of
saint
and
symbol
my
smug
notebook
states
that
all
this
was
an
admission
that
the
saints
but
embodied
fine
action
and
it
proceeds
at
some
length
to
set
forth
my
hope
for
a
cathedral
of
humanity
which
should
be
capacious
enough
to
house
a
fellowship
of
common
purpose
and
which
should
be
beautiful
enough
to
persuade
men
to
hold
fast
to
the
vision
of
human
solidarity
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
reproduce
this
experience
at
ulm
unless
i
quote
pages
more
from
the
notebook
in
which
i
seem
to
have
written
half
the
night
in
a
fever
of
composition
cast
in
phrases
from
comte
it
doubtless
reflected
also
something
of
the
faith
of
the
old
catholics
a
charming
group
of
whom
i
had
recently
met
in
stuttgart
and
the
same
mood
is
easily
traced
in
my
early
hopes
for
the
settlement
that
it
should
unite
in
the
fellowship
of
the
deed
those
of
widely
differing
religious
beliefs
the
beginning
of
found
our
little
party
of
three
in
very
picturesque
lodgings
in
rome
and
settled
into
a
certain
student
routine
but
my
study
of
the
catacombs
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
in
a
fortnight
by
a
severe
attack
of
sciatic
rheumatism
which
kept
me
in
rome
with
a
trained
nurse
during
many
weeks
and
later
sent
me
to
the
riviera
to
lead
an
life
once
more
although
my
catacomb
lore
thus
remained
hopelessly
superficial
it
seemed
to
me
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
course
of
six
lectures
which
i
timidly
offered
to
a
training
school
during
my
first
winter
in
chicago
upon
the
simple
ground
that
this
early
interpretation
of
christianity
is
the
one
which
should
be
presented
to
the
poor
urging
that
the
primitive
church
was
composed
of
the
poor
and
that
it
was
they
who
took
the
wonderful
news
to
the
more
prosperous
romans
the
head
of
the
school
gladly
accepted
the
lectures
arranging
that
the
course
should
be
given
each
spring
to
her
graduating
class
of
home
and
foreign
missionaries
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
she
invited
me
to
become
one
of
the
trustees
of
the
school
i
accepted
and
attended
one
meeting
of
the
board
but
never
another
because
some
of
the
older
members
objected
to
my
membership
on
the
ground
that
no
religious
instruction
was
given
at
i
remember
my
sympathy
for
the
embarrassment
in
which
the
head
of
the
school
was
placed
but
if
i
needed
comfort
a
bit
of
it
came
to
me
on
my
way
home
from
the
trustees
meeting
when
an
italian
laborer
paid
my
fare
according
to
the
custom
of
our
simpler
neighbors
upon
my
inquiry
of
the
conductor
as
to
whom
i
was
indebted
for
the
little
courtesy
he
replied
roughly
enough
i
can
not
tell
one
dago
from
another
when
they
are
in
a
gang
but
sure
any
one
of
them
would
do
it
for
you
as
quick
as
they
would
for
the
sisters
it
is
hard
to
tell
just
when
the
very
simple
plan
which
afterward
developed
into
the
settlement
began
to
form
itself
in
my
mind
it
may
have
been
even
before
i
went
to
europe
for
the
second
time
but
i
gradually
became
convinced
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
rent
a
house
in
a
part
of
the
city
where
many
primitive
and
actual
needs
are
found
in
which
young
women
who
had
been
given
over
too
exclusively
to
study
might
restore
a
balance
of
activity
along
traditional
lines
and
learn
of
life
from
life
itself
where
they
might
try
out
some
of
the
things
they
had
been
taught
and
put
truth
to
the
ultimate
test
of
the
conduct
it
dictates
or
inspires
i
do
not
remember
to
have
mentioned
this
plan
to
anyone
until
we
reached
madrid
in
april
we
had
been
to
see
a
bull
fight
rendered
in
the
most
magnificent
spanish
style
where
greatly
to
my
surprise
and
horror
i
found
that
i
had
seen
with
comparative
indifference
five
bulls
and
many
more
horses
killed
the
sense
that
this
was
the
last
survival
of
all
the
glories
of
the
amphitheater
the
illusion
that
the
riders
on
the
caparisoned
horses
might
have
been
knights
of
a
tournament
or
the
matadore
a
slightly
armed
gladiator
facing
his
martyrdom
and
all
the
rest
of
the
obscure
yet
vivid
associations
of
an
historic
survival
had
carried
me
beyond
the
endurance
of
any
of
the
rest
of
the
party
i
finally
met
them
in
the
foyer
stern
and
pale
with
disapproval
of
my
brutal
endurance
and
but
partially
recovered
from
the
faintness
and
disgust
which
the
spectacle
itself
had
produced
upon
them
i
had
no
defense
to
offer
to
their
reproaches
save
that
i
had
not
thought
much
about
the
bloodshed
but
in
the
evening
the
natural
and
inevitable
reaction
came
and
in
deep
chagrin
i
felt
myself
tried
and
condemned
not
only
by
this
disgusting
experience
but
by
the
entire
moral
situation
which
it
revealed
it
was
suddenly
made
quite
clear
to
me
that
i
was
lulling
my
conscience
by
a
dreamer
scheme
that
a
mere
paper
reform
had
become
a
defense
for
continued
idleness
and
that
i
was
making
it
a
raison
for
going
on
indefinitely
with
study
and
travel
it
is
easy
to
become
the
dupe
of
a
deferred
purpose
of
the
promise
the
future
can
never
keep
and
i
had
fallen
into
the
meanest
type
of
in
making
myself
believe
that
all
this
was
in
preparation
for
great
things
to
come
nothing
less
than
the
moral
reaction
following
the
experience
at
a
bullfight
had
been
able
to
reveal
to
me
that
so
far
from
following
in
the
wake
of
a
chariot
of
philanthropic
fire
i
had
been
tied
to
the
tail
of
the
veriest
of
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
next
day
whatever
happened
i
would
begin
to
carry
out
the
plan
if
only
by
talking
about
it
i
can
well
recall
the
stumbling
and
uncertainty
with
which
i
finally
set
it
forth
to
miss
starr
my
school
friend
who
was
one
of
our
party
i
even
dared
to
hope
that
she
might
join
in
carrying
out
the
plan
but
nevertheless
i
told
it
in
the
fear
of
that
disheartening
experience
which
is
so
apt
to
afflict
our
most
cherished
plans
when
they
are
at
last
divulged
when
we
suddenly
feel
that
there
is
nothing
there
to
talk
about
and
as
the
golden
dream
slips
through
our
fingers
we
are
left
to
wonder
at
our
own
fatuous
belief
but
gradually
the
comfort
of
miss
companionship
the
vigor
and
enthusiasm
which
she
brought
to
bear
upon
it
told
both
in
the
growth
of
the
plan
and
upon
the
sense
of
its
validity
so
that
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
enchantment
of
the
alhambra
the
scheme
had
become
convincing
and
tangible
although
still
most
hazy
in
detail
a
month
later
we
parted
in
paris
miss
starr
to
go
back
to
italy
and
i
to
journey
on
to
london
to
secure
as
many
suggestions
as
possible
from
those
wonderful
places
of
which
we
had
heard
toynbee
hall
and
the
people
palace
so
that
it
finally
came
about
that
in
june
five
years
after
my
first
visit
in
east
london
i
found
myself
at
toynbee
hall
equipped
not
only
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
canon
fremantle
but
with
high
expectations
and
a
certain
belief
that
whatever
perplexities
and
discouragement
concerning
the
life
of
the
poor
were
in
store
for
me
i
should
at
least
know
something
at
first
hand
and
have
the
solace
of
daily
activity
i
had
confidence
that
although
life
itself
might
contain
many
difficulties
the
period
of
mere
passive
receptivity
had
come
to
an
end
and
i
had
at
last
finished
with
the
preparation
for
life
however
i
might
be
it
was
not
until
years
afterward
that
i
came
upon
tolstoy
phrase
the
snare
of
preparation
which
he
insists
we
spread
before
the
feet
of
young
people
hopelessly
entangling
them
in
a
curious
inactivity
at
the
very
period
of
life
when
they
are
longing
to
construct
the
world
anew
and
to
conform
it
to
their
own
ideals

v

at
the

january
found
miss
starr
and
myself
in
chicago
searching
for
a
neighborhood
in
which
we
might
put
our
plans
into
execution
in
our
eagerness
to
win
friends
for
the
new
undertaking
we
utilized
every
opportunity
to
set
forth
the
meaning
of
the
settlement
as
it
had
been
embodied
at
toynbee
hall
although
in
those
days
we
made
no
appeal
for
money
meaning
to
start
with
our
own
slender
resources
from
the
very
first
the
plan
received
courteous
attention
and
the
discussion
while
often
skeptical
was
always
friendly
professor
swing
wrote
a
commendatory
column
in
the
evening
journal
and
our
early
speeches
were
reported
quite
out
of
proportion
to
their
worth
i
recall
a
spirited
evening
at
the
home
of
wilmarth
which
was
attended
by
that
renowned
scholar
thomas
davidson
and
by
a
young
englishman
who
was
a
member
of
the
then
new
fabian
society
and
to
whom
a
peculiar
glamour
was
attached
because
he
had
scoured
knives
all
summer
in
a
camp
of
philosophers
in
the
adirondacks
our
new
little
plan
met
with
criticism
not
to
say
disapproval
from
davidson
who
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
called
it
one
of
those
unnatural
attempts
to
understand
life
through
cooperative
living
it
was
in
vain
we
asserted
that
the
collective
living
was
not
an
essential
part
of
the
plan
that
we
would
always
scrupulously
pay
our
own
expenses
and
that
at
any
moment
we
might
decide
to
scatter
through
the
neighborhood
and
to
live
in
separate
tenements
he
still
contended
that
the
fascination
for
most
of
those
volunteering
residence
would
lie
in
the
collective
living
aspect
of
the
settlement
his
contention
was
of
course
essentially
sound
there
is
a
constant
tendency
for
the
residents
to
lose
themselves
in
the
cave
of
their
own
companionship
as
the
toynbee
hall
phrase
goes
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
doubtless
true
that
the
very
companionship
the
give
and
take
of
colleagues
is
what
tends
to
keep
the
settlement
normal
and
in
touch
with
the
world
of
things
as
they
are
i
am
happy
to
say
that
we
never
resented
this
nor
any
other
difference
of
opinion
and
that
fifteen
years
later
professor
davidson
handsomely
acknowledged
that
the
advantages
of
a
group
far
outweighed
the
weaknesses
he
had
early
pointed
out
he
was
at
that
later
moment
sharing
with
a
group
of
young
men
on
the
east
side
of
new
york
his
ripest
conclusions
in
philosophy
and
was
much
touched
by
their
intelligent
interest
and
absorbed
devotion
i
think
that
time
has
also
justified
our
early
contention
that
the
mere
foothold
of
a
house
easily
accessible
ample
in
space
hospitable
and
tolerant
in
spirit
situated
in
the
midst
of
the
large
foreign
colonies
which
so
easily
isolate
themselves
in
american
cities
would
be
in
itself
a
serviceable
thing
for
chicago
i
am
not
so
sure
that
we
succeeded
in
our
endeavors
to
make
social
intercourse
express
the
growing
sense
of
the
economic
unity
of
society
and
to
add
the
social
function
to
democracy
but
was
soberly
opened
on
the
theory
that
the
dependence
of
classes
on
each
other
is
reciprocal
and
that
as
the
social
relation
is
essentially
a
reciprocal
relation
it
gives
a
form
of
expression
that
has
peculiar
value
in
our
search
for
a
vicinity
in
which
to
settle
we
went
about
with
the
officers
of
the
compulsory
education
department
with
city
missionaries
and
with
the
newspaper
reporters
whom
i
recall
as
a
much
older
set
of
men
than
one
ordinarily
associates
with
that
profession
or
perhaps
i
was
only
sent
out
with
the
older
ones
on
what
they
must
all
have
considered
a
quixotic
mission
one
sunday
afternoon
in
the
late
winter
a
reporter
took
me
to
visit
a
anarchist
sunday
school
several
of
which
were
to
be
found
on
the
northwest
side
of
the
city
the
young
man
in
charge
was
of
the
german
student
type
and
his
face
flushed
with
enthusiasm
as
he
led
the
children
singing
one
of
koerner
poems
the
newspaperman
who
did
not
understand
german
asked
me
what
abominable
stuff
they
were
singing
but
he
seemed
dissatisfied
with
my
translation
of
the
simple
words
and
darkly
intimated
that
they
were
deep
ones
and
had
probably
fooled
me
when
i
replied
that
koerner
was
an
ardent
german
poet
whose
songs
inspired
his
countrymen
to
resist
the
aggressions
of
napoleon
and
that
his
bound
poems
were
found
in
the
most
respectable
libraries
he
looked
at
me
rather
askance
and
i
then
and
there
had
my
first
intimation
that
to
treat
a
chicago
man
who
is
called
an
anarchist
as
you
would
treat
any
other
citizen
is
to
lay
yourself
open
to
deep
suspicion
another
sunday
afternoon
in
the
early
spring
on
the
way
to
a
bohemian
mission
in
the
carriage
of
one
of
its
founders
we
passed
a
fine
old
house
standing
well
back
from
the
street
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
broad
piazza
which
was
supported
by
wooden
pillars
of
exceptionally
pure
corinthian
design
and
proportion
i
was
so
attracted
by
the
house
that
i
set
forth
to
visit
it
the
very
next
day
but
though
i
searched
for
it
then
and
for
several
days
after
i
could
not
find
it
and
at
length
i
most
reluctantly
gave
up
the
search
three
weeks
later
with
the
advice
of
several
of
the
oldest
residents
of
chicago
including
the
of
the
city
colonel
mason
who
had
from
the
first
been
a
warm
friend
to
our
plans
we
decided
upon
a
location
somewhere
near
the
junction
of
blue
island
avenue
halsted
street
and
harrison
street
i
was
surprised
and
overjoyed
on
the
very
first
day
of
our
search
for
quarters
to
come
upon
the
hospitable
old
house
the
quest
for
which
i
had
so
recently
abandoned
the
house
was
of
course
rented
the
lower
part
of
it
used
for
offices
and
storerooms
in
connection
with
a
factory
that
stood
back
of
it
however
after
some
difficulties
were
overcome
it
proved
to
be
possible
to
sublet
the
second
floor
and
what
had
been
a
large
on
the
first
floor
the
house
had
passed
through
many
changes
since
it
had
been
built
in
for
the
homestead
of
one
of
chicago
pioneer
citizens
charles
j
hull
and
although
battered
by
its
vicissitudes
was
essentially
sound
before
it
had
been
occupied
by
the
factory
it
had
sheltered
a
furniture
store
and
at
one
time
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor
had
used
it
for
a
home
for
the
aged
it
had
a
reputation
for
a
haunted
attic
so
far
respected
by
the
tenants
living
on
the
second
floor
that
they
always
kept
a
large
pitcher
full
of
water
on
the
attic
stairs
their
explanation
of
this
custom
was
so
incoherent
that
i
was
sure
it
was
a
survival
of
the
belief
that
a
ghost
could
not
cross
running
water
but
perhaps
that
interpretation
was
only
my
eagerness
for
finding
folklore
the
fine
old
house
responded
kindly
to
repairs
its
wide
hall
and
open
fireplace
always
insuring
it
a
gracious
aspect
its
generous
owner
miss
helen
culver
in
the
following
spring
gave
us
a
free
leasehold
of
the
entire
house
her
kindness
has
continued
through
the
years
until
the
group
of
thirteen
buildings
which
at
present
comprises
our
equipment
is
built
largely
upon
land
which
miss
culver
has
put
at
the
service
of
the
settlement
which
bears
mr
hull
name
in
those
days
the
house
stood
between
an
undertaking
establishment
and
a
saloon
knight
death
and
the
devil
the
three
were
called
by
a
chicago
wit
and
yet
any
mock
heroics
which
might
be
implied
by
comparing
the
settlement
to
a
knight
quickly
dropped
away
under
the
genuine
kindness
and
hearty
welcome
extended
to
us
by
the
families
living
up
and
down
the
street
we
furnished
the
house
as
we
would
have
furnished
it
were
it
in
another
part
of
the
city
with
the
photographs
and
other
impedimenta
we
had
collected
in
europe
and
with
a
few
bits
of
family
mahogany
while
all
the
new
furniture
which
was
bought
was
enduring
in
quality
we
were
careful
to
keep
it
in
character
with
the
fine
old
residence
probably
no
young
matron
ever
placed
her
own
things
in
her
own
house
with
more
pleasure
than
that
with
which
we
first
furnished
we
believed
that
the
settlement
may
logically
bring
to
its
aid
all
those
adjuncts
which
the
cultivated
man
regards
as
good
and
suggestive
of
the
best
of
the
life
of
the
past
on
the
of
september
miss
starr
and
i
moved
into
it
with
miss
mary
keyser
who
began
performing
the
housework
but
who
quickly
developed
into
a
very
important
factor
in
the
life
of
the
vicinity
as
well
as
that
of
the
household
and
whose
death
five
years
later
was
most
sincerely
mourned
by
hundreds
of
our
neighbors
in
our
enthusiasm
over
settling
the
first
night
we
forgot
not
only
to
lock
but
to
close
a
side
door
opening
on
polk
street
and
we
were
much
pleased
in
the
morning
to
find
that
we
possessed
a
fine
illustration
of
the
honesty
and
kindliness
of
our
new
neighbors
our
first
guest
was
an
interesting
young
woman
who
lived
in
a
neighboring
tenement
whose
widowed
mother
aided
her
in
the
support
of
the
family
by
scrubbing
a
downtown
theater
every
night
the
mother
of
english
birth
was
well
bred
and
carefully
educated
but
was
in
the
midst
of
that
bitter
struggle
which
awaits
so
many
strangers
in
american
cities
who
find
that
their
social
position
tends
to
be
measured
solely
by
the
standards
of
living
they
are
able
to
maintain
our
guest
has
long
since
married
the
struggling
young
lawyer
to
whom
she
was
then
engaged
and
he
is
now
leading
his
profession
in
an
eastern
city
she
recalls
that
month
experience
always
with
a
sense
of
amusement
over
the
fact
that
the
succession
of
visitors
who
came
to
see
the
new
settlement
invariably
questioned
her
most
minutely
concerning
these
people
without
once
suspecting
that
they
were
talking
to
one
who
had
been
identified
with
the
neighborhood
from
childhood
i
at
least
was
able
to
draw
a
lesson
from
the
incident
and
i
never
addressed
a
chicago
audience
on
the
subject
of
the
settlement
and
its
vicinity
without
inviting
a
neighbor
to
go
with
me
that
i
might
curb
any
hasty
generalization
by
the
consciousness
that
i
had
an
auditor
who
knew
the
conditions
more
intimately
than
i
could
hope
to
do
halsted
street
has
grown
so
familiar
during
twenty
years
of
residence
that
it
is
difficult
to
recall
its
gradual
changes
the
withdrawal
of
the
more
prosperous
irish
and
germans
and
the
slow
substitution
of
russian
jews
italians
and
greeks
a
description
of
the
street
such
as
i
gave
in
those
early
addresses
still
stands
in
my
mind
as
sympathetic
and
correct
halsted
street
is
miles
long
and
one
of
the
great
thoroughfares
of
chicago
polk
street
crosses
it
midway
between
the
stockyards
to
the
south
and
the
shipbuilding
yards
on
the
north
branch
of
the
chicago
river
for
the
six
miles
between
these
two
industries
the
street
is
lined
with
shops
of
butchers
and
grocers
with
dingy
and
gorgeous
saloons
and
pretentious
establishments
for
the
sale
of
clothing
polk
street
running
west
from
halsted
street
grows
rapidly
more
prosperous
running
a
mile
east
to
state
street
it
grows
steadily
worse
and
crosses
a
network
of
vice
on
the
corners
of
clark
street
and
fifth
avenue
once
stood
in
the
suburbs
but
the
city
has
steadily
grown
up
around
it
and
its
site
now
has
corners
on
three
or
four
foreign
colonies
between
halsted
street
and
the
river
live
about
ten
thousand
italians
neapolitans
sicilians
and
calabrians
with
an
occasional
lombard
or
venetian
to
the
south
on
twelfth
street
are
many
germans
and
side
streets
are
given
over
almost
entirely
to
polish
and
russian
jews
still
farther
south
these
jewish
colonies
merge
into
a
huge
bohemian
colony
so
vast
that
chicago
ranks
as
the
third
bohemian
city
in
the
world
to
the
northwest
are
many
clannish
in
spite
of
their
long
residence
in
america
and
to
the
north
are
irish
and
americans
on
the
streets
directly
west
and
farther
north
are
english
speaking
families
many
of
whom
own
their
own
houses
and
have
lived
in
the
neighborhood
for
years
one
man
is
still
living
in
his
old
farmhouse
the
policy
of
the
public
authorities
of
never
taking
an
initiative
and
always
waiting
to
be
urged
to
do
their
duty
is
obviously
fatal
in
a
neighborhood
where
there
is
little
initiative
among
the
citizens
the
idea
underlying
our
government
breaks
down
in
such
a
ward
the
streets
are
inexpressibly
dirty
the
number
of
schools
inadequate
sanitary
legislation
unenforced
the
street
lighting
bad
the
paving
miserable
and
altogether
lacking
in
the
alleys
and
smaller
streets
and
the
stables
foul
beyond
description
hundreds
of
houses
are
unconnected
with
the
street
sewer
the
older
and
richer
inhabitants
seem
anxious
to
move
away
as
rapidly
as
they
can
afford
it
they
make
room
for
newly
arrived
immigrants
who
are
densely
ignorant
of
civic
duties
this
substitution
of
the
older
inhabitants
is
accomplished
industrially
also
in
the
south
and
east
quarters
of
the
ward
the
jews
and
italians
do
the
finishing
for
the
great
clothing
manufacturers
formerly
done
by
americans
irish
and
germans
who
refused
to
submit
to
the
extremely
low
prices
to
which
the
sweating
system
has
reduced
their
successors
as
the
design
of
the
sweating
system
is
the
elimination
of
rent
from
the
manufacture
of
clothing
the
outside
work
is
begun
after
the
clothing
leaves
the
cutter
an
unscrupulous
contractor
regards
no
basement
as
too
dark
no
stable
loft
too
foul
no
rear
shanty
too
provisional
no
tenement
room
too
small
for
his
workroom
as
these
conditions
imply
low
rental
hence
these
shops
abound
in
the
worst
of
the
foreign
districts
where
the
sweater
easily
finds
his
cheap
basement
and
his
home
finishers
the
houses
of
the
ward
for
the
most
part
wooden
were
originally
built
for
one
family
and
are
now
occupied
by
several
they
are
after
the
type
of
the
inconvenient
frame
cottages
found
in
the
poorer
suburbs
twenty
years
ago
many
of
them
were
built
where
they
now
stand
others
were
brought
thither
on
rollers
because
their
previous
sites
had
been
taken
by
factories
the
fewer
brick
tenement
buildings
which
are
three
or
four
stories
high
are
comparatively
new
and
there
are
few
large
tenements
the
little
wooden
houses
have
a
temporary
aspect
and
for
this
reason
perhaps
the
legislation
in
chicago
is
totally
inadequate
rear
tenements
flourish
many
houses
have
no
water
supply
save
the
faucet
in
the
back
yard
there
are
no
fire
escapes
the
garbage
and
ashes
are
placed
in
wooden
boxes
which
are
fastened
to
the
street
pavements
one
of
the
most
discouraging
features
about
the
present
system
of
tenement
houses
is
that
many
are
owned
by
sordid
and
ignorant
immigrants
the
theory
that
wealth
brings
responsibility
that
possession
entails
at
length
education
and
refinement
in
these
cases
fails
utterly
the
children
of
an
italian
immigrant
owner
may
shine
shoes
in
the
street
and
his
wife
may
pick
rags
from
the
street
gutter
laboriously
sorting
them
in
a
dingy
court
wealth
may
do
something
for
her
and
feeling
of
consequence
it
certainly
does
nothing
for
her
comfort
or
her
children
improvement
nor
for
the
cleanliness
of
anyone
concerned
another
thing
that
prevents
better
houses
in
chicago
is
the
tentative
attitude
of
the
real
estate
men
many
unsavory
conditions
are
allowed
to
continue
which
would
be
regarded
with
horror
if
they
were
considered
permanent
meanwhile
the
wretched
conditions
persist
until
at
least
two
generations
of
children
have
been
born
and
reared
in
them
in
every
neighborhood
where
poorer
people
live
because
rents
are
supposed
to
be
cheaper
there
is
an
element
which
although
uncertain
in
the
individual
in
the
aggregate
can
be
counted
upon
it
is
composed
of
people
of
former
education
and
opportunity
who
have
cherished
ambitions
and
prospects
but
who
are
caricatures
of
what
they
meant
to
be
hollow
ghosts
which
blame
the
living
men
there
are
times
in
many
lives
when
there
is
a
cessation
of
energy
and
loss
of
power
men
and
women
of
education
and
refinement
come
to
live
in
a
cheaper
neighborhood
because
they
lack
the
ability
to
make
money
because
of
ill
health
because
of
an
unfortunate
marriage
or
for
other
reasons
which
do
not
imply
criminality
or
stupidity
among
them
are
those
who
in
spite
of
untoward
circumstances
keep
up
some
sort
of
an
intellectual
life
those
who
are
great
for
books
as
their
neighbors
say
to
such
the
settlement
may
be
a
genuine
refuge
in
the
very
first
weeks
of
our
residence
miss
starr
started
a
reading
party
in
george
eliot
romola
which
was
attended
by
a
group
of
young
women
who
followed
the
wonderful
tale
with
unflagging
interest
the
weekly
reading
was
held
in
our
little
upstairs
dining
room
and
two
members
of
the
club
came
to
dinner
each
week
not
only
that
they
might
be
received
as
guests
but
that
they
might
help
us
wash
the
dishes
afterwards
and
so
make
the
table
ready
for
the
stacks
of
florentine
photographs
our
first
resident
as
she
gaily
designated
herself
was
a
charming
old
lady
who
gave
five
consecutive
readings
from
hawthorne
to
a
most
appreciative
audience
interspersing
the
magic
tales
most
delightfully
with
recollections
of
the
elusive
and
fascinating
author
years
before
she
had
lived
at
brook
farm
as
a
pupil
of
the
ripleys
and
she
came
to
us
for
ten
days
because
she
wished
to
live
once
more
in
an
atmosphere
where
idealism
ran
high
we
thus
early
found
the
type
of
class
which
through
all
the
years
has
remained
most
popular
a
combination
of
a
social
atmosphere
with
serious
study
volunteers
to
the
new
undertaking
came
quickly
a
charming
young
girl
conducted
a
kindergarten
in
the
drawing
room
coming
regularly
every
morning
from
her
home
in
a
distant
part
of
the
north
side
of
the
city
although
a
tablet
to
her
memory
has
stood
upon
a
mantel
shelf
in
for
five
years
we
still
associate
her
most
vividly
with
the
play
of
little
children
first
in
her
kindergarten
and
then
in
her
own
nursery
which
furnished
a
veritable
illustration
of
victor
hugo
definition
of
heaven
a
place
where
parents
are
always
young
and
children
always
little
her
daily
presence
for
the
first
two
years
made
it
quite
impossible
for
us
to
become
too
solemn
and
in
our
strenuous
routine
for
her
mirth
and
buoyancy
were
irresistible
and
her
eager
desire
to
share
the
life
of
the
neighborhood
never
failed
although
it
was
often
put
to
a
severe
test
one
day
at
luncheon
she
gaily
recited
her
futile
attempt
to
impress
temperance
principles
upon
the
mind
of
an
italian
mother
to
whom
she
had
returned
a
small
daughter
of
five
sent
to
the
kindergarten
in
quite
a
horrid
state
of
intoxication
from
the
bread
upon
which
she
had
breakfasted
the
mother
with
the
gentle
courtesy
of
a
south
italian
listened
politely
to
her
graphic
portrayal
of
the
untimely
end
awaiting
so
immature
a
wine
bibber
but
long
before
the
lecture
was
finished
quite
unconscious
of
the
incongruity
she
hospitably
set
forth
her
best
wines
and
when
her
baffled
guest
refused
one
after
the
other
she
disappeared
only
to
quickly
return
with
a
small
dark
glass
of
whisky
saying
reassuringly
see
i
have
brought
you
the
true
american
drink
the
recital
ended
in
seriocomic
despair
with
the
rueful
statement
that
the
impression
i
probably
made
on
her
darkened
mind
was
that
it
was
the
american
custom
to
breakfast
children
on
bread
soaked
in
whisky
instead
of
light
italian
wine
that
first
kindergarten
was
a
constant
source
of
education
to
us
we
were
much
surprised
to
find
social
distinctions
even
among
its
lambs
although
greatly
amused
with
the
neat
formulation
made
by
the
superior
little
italian
boy
who
refused
to
sit
beside
uncouth
little
angelina
because
we
eat
our
macaroni
this
way
imitating
the
movement
of
a
fork
from
a
plate
to
his
mouth
and
she
eat
her
macaroni
this
way
holding
his
hand
high
in
the
air
and
throwing
back
his
head
that
his
mouth
might
receive
an
imaginary
cascade
angelina
gravely
nodded
her
little
head
in
approval
of
this
distinction
between
gentry
and
peasant
but
is
it
astonishing
that
merely
table
manners
are
made
such
a
test
all
the
way
along
was
the
comment
of
their
democratic
teacher
another
memory
which
refuses
to
be
associated
with
death
which
came
to
her
all
too
soon
is
that
of
the
young
girl
who
organized
our
first
really
successful
club
of
boys
holding
their
fascinated
interest
by
the
old
chivalric
tales
set
forth
so
dramatically
and
vividly
that
checkers
and
jackstraws
were
abandoned
by
all
the
other
clubs
on
boys
day
that
their
members
might
form
a
listening
fringe
to
the
young
heros
i
met
a
member
of
the
latter
club
one
day
as
he
flung
himself
out
of
the
house
in
the
rage
by
which
an
emotional
boy
hopes
to
keep
from
shedding
tears
there
is
no
use
coming
here
any
more
prince
roland
is
dead
he
gruffly
explained
as
we
passed
we
encouraged
the
younger
boys
in
tournaments
and
dramatics
of
all
sorts
and
we
somewhat
fatuously
believed
that
boys
who
were
early
interested
in
adventurers
or
explorers
might
later
want
to
know
the
lives
of
living
statesmen
and
inventors
it
is
needless
to
add
that
the
boys
quickly
responded
to
such
a
program
and
that
the
only
difficulty
lay
in
finding
leaders
who
were
able
to
carry
it
out
this
difficulty
has
been
with
us
through
all
the
years
of
growth
and
development
in
the
boys
club
until
now
with
its
building
its
splendid
equipment
of
shops
of
recreation
and
study
rooms
that
group
alone
is
successful
which
commands
the
services
of
a
resourceful
and
devoted
leader
the
dozens
of
younger
children
who
from
the
first
came
to
house
were
organized
into
groups
which
were
not
quite
classes
and
not
quite
clubs
the
value
of
these
groups
consisted
almost
entirely
in
arousing
a
higher
imagination
and
in
giving
the
children
the
opportunity
which
they
could
not
have
in
the
crowded
schools
for
initiative
and
for
independent
social
relationships
the
public
schools
then
contained
little
hand
work
of
any
sort
so
that
naturally
any
instruction
which
we
provided
for
the
children
took
the
direction
of
this
supplementary
work
but
it
required
a
constant
effort
that
the
pressure
of
poverty
itself
should
not
defeat
the
educational
aim
the
italian
girls
in
the
sewing
classes
would
count
the
day
lost
when
they
could
not
carry
home
a
garment
and
the
insistence
that
it
should
be
neatly
made
seemed
a
to
those
in
dire
need
of
clothing
as
these
clubs
have
been
continued
during
the
twenty
years
they
have
developed
classes
in
the
many
forms
of
handicraft
which
the
newer
education
is
so
rapidly
adapting
for
the
delight
of
children
but
they
still
keep
their
essentially
social
character
and
still
minister
to
that
large
number
of
children
who
leave
school
the
very
week
they
are
fourteen
years
old
only
too
eager
to
close
the
schoolroom
door
forever
on
a
tiresome
task
that
is
at
last
well
over
it
seems
to
us
important
that
these
children
shall
find
themselves
permanently
attached
to
a
house
that
offers
them
evening
clubs
and
classes
with
their
old
companions
that
merges
as
easily
as
possible
the
school
life
into
the
working
life
and
does
what
it
can
to
find
places
for
the
bewildered
young
things
looking
for
work
a
large
proportion
of
the
delinquent
boys
brought
into
the
juvenile
court
in
chicago
are
the
oldest
sons
in
large
families
whose
wages
are
needed
at
home
the
grades
from
which
many
of
them
leave
school
as
the
records
show
are
piteously
far
from
the
seventh
and
eighth
where
the
very
first
introduction
in
manual
training
is
given
nor
have
they
been
caught
by
any
other
abiding
interest
in
spite
of
these
flourishing
clubs
for
children
early
established
at
and
the
fact
that
our
first
organized
undertaking
was
a
kindergarten
we
were
very
insistent
that
the
settlement
should
not
be
primarily
for
the
children
and
that
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
grown
people
would
not
respond
to
opportunities
for
education
and
social
life
our
enthusiastic
kindergartner
herself
demonstrated
this
with
an
old
woman
of
ninety
who
because
she
was
left
alone
all
day
while
her
daughter
cooked
in
a
restaurant
had
formed
such
a
persistent
habit
of
picking
the
plaster
off
the
walls
that
one
landlord
after
another
refused
to
have
her
for
a
tenant
it
required
but
a
few
time
to
teach
her
to
make
large
paper
chains
and
gradually
she
was
content
to
do
it
all
day
long
and
in
the
end
took
quite
as
much
pleasure
in
adorning
the
walls
as
she
had
formally
taken
in
demolishing
them
fortunately
the
landlord
had
never
heard
the
aesthetic
principle
that
exposure
of
basic
construction
is
more
desirable
than
gaudy
decoration
in
course
of
time
it
was
discovered
that
the
old
woman
could
speak
gaelic
and
when
one
or
two
grave
professors
came
to
see
her
the
neighborhood
was
filled
with
pride
that
such
a
wonder
lived
in
their
midst
to
mitigate
life
for
a
woman
of
ninety
was
an
unfailing
refutation
of
the
statement
that
the
settlement
was
designed
for
the
young
on
our
first
new
year
day
at
we
invited
the
older
people
in
the
vicinity
sending
a
carriage
for
the
most
feeble
and
announcing
to
all
of
them
that
we
were
going
to
organize
an
old
settlers
party
every
new
year
day
since
older
people
in
varying
numbers
have
come
together
at
to
relate
early
hardships
and
to
take
for
the
moment
the
place
in
the
community
to
which
their
pioneer
life
entitles
them
many
people
who
were
formerly
residents
of
the
vicinity
but
whom
prosperity
has
carried
into
more
desirable
neighborhoods
come
back
to
these
meetings
and
often
confess
to
each
other
that
they
have
never
since
found
such
kindness
as
in
early
chicago
when
all
its
citizens
came
together
in
mutual
enterprises
many
of
these
pioneers
so
like
the
men
and
women
of
my
earliest
childhood
that
i
always
felt
comforted
by
their
presence
in
the
house
were
very
much
opposed
to
foreigners
whom
they
held
responsible
for
a
depreciation
of
property
and
a
general
lowering
of
the
tone
of
the
neighborhood
sometimes
we
had
a
chance
for
championship
i
recall
one
old
man
fiercely
american
who
had
reproached
me
because
we
had
so
many
foreign
views
on
our
walls
to
whom
i
endeavored
to
set
forth
our
hope
that
the
pictures
might
afford
a
familiar
island
to
the
immigrants
in
a
sea
of
new
and
strange
impressions
the
old
settler
guest
taken
off
his
guard
replied
i
see
they
feel
as
we
did
when
we
saw
a
yankee
notion
from
down
east
thereby
formulating
the
dim
kinship
between
the
pioneer
and
the
immigrant
both
buffeting
the
waves
of
a
new
development
the
older
settlers
as
well
as
their
children
throughout
the
years
have
given
genuine
help
to
our
various
enterprises
for
neighborhood
improvement
and
from
their
own
memories
of
earlier
hardships
have
made
many
shrewd
suggestions
for
alleviating
the
difficulties
of
that
first
sharp
struggle
with
untoward
conditions
in
those
early
days
we
were
often
asked
why
we
had
come
to
live
on
halsted
street
when
we
could
afford
to
live
somewhere
else
i
remember
one
man
who
used
to
shake
his
head
and
say
it
was
the
strangest
thing
he
had
met
in
his
experience
but
who
was
finally
convinced
that
it
was
not
strange
but
natural
in
time
it
came
to
seem
natural
to
all
of
us
that
the
settlement
should
be
there
if
it
is
natural
to
feed
the
hungry
and
care
for
the
sick
it
is
certainly
natural
to
give
pleasure
to
the
young
comfort
to
the
aged
and
to
minister
to
the
craving
for
social
intercourse
that
all
men
feel
whoever
does
it
is
rewarded
by
something
which
if
not
gratitude
is
at
least
spontaneous
and
vital
and
lacks
that
irksome
sense
of
obligation
with
which
a
substantial
benefit
is
too
often
acknowledged
in
addition
to
the
neighbors
who
responded
to
the
receptions
and
classes
we
found
those
who
were
too
battered
and
oppressed
to
care
for
them
to
these
however
was
left
that
susceptibility
to
the
bare
offices
of
humanity
which
raises
such
offices
into
a
bond
of
fellowship
from
the
first
it
seemed
understood
that
we
were
ready
to
perform
the
humblest
neighborhood
services
we
were
asked
to
wash
the
babies
and
to
prepare
the
dead
for
burial
to
nurse
the
sick
and
to
mind
the
children
occasionally
these
neighborly
offices
unexpectedly
uncovered
ugly
human
traits
for
six
weeks
after
an
operation
we
kept
in
one
of
our
three
bedrooms
a
forlorn
little
baby
who
because
he
was
born
with
a
cleft
palate
was
most
unwelcome
even
to
his
mother
and
we
were
horrified
when
he
died
of
neglect
a
week
after
he
was
returned
to
his
home
a
little
italian
bride
of
fifteen
sought
shelter
with
us
one
november
evening
to
escape
her
husband
who
had
beaten
her
every
night
for
a
week
when
he
returned
home
from
work
because
she
had
lost
her
wedding
ring
two
of
us
officiated
quite
alone
at
the
birth
of
an
illegitimate
child
because
the
doctor
was
late
in
arriving
and
none
of
the
honest
irish
matrons
would
touch
the
likes
of
her
we
ministered
at
the
deathbed
of
a
young
man
who
during
a
long
illness
of
tuberculosis
had
received
so
many
bottles
of
whisky
through
the
mistaken
kindness
of
his
friends
that
the
cumulative
effect
produced
wild
periods
of
exultation
in
one
of
which
he
died
we
were
also
early
impressed
with
the
curious
isolation
of
many
of
the
immigrants
an
italian
woman
once
expressed
her
pleasure
in
the
red
roses
that
she
saw
at
one
of
our
receptions
in
surprise
that
they
had
been
brought
so
fresh
all
the
way
from
italy
she
would
not
believe
for
an
instant
that
they
had
been
grown
in
america
she
said
that
she
had
lived
in
chicago
for
six
years
and
had
never
seen
any
roses
whereas
in
italy
she
had
seen
them
every
summer
in
great
profusion
during
all
that
time
of
course
the
woman
had
lived
within
ten
blocks
of
a
window
she
had
not
been
more
than
a
car
ride
away
from
the
public
parks
but
she
had
never
dreamed
of
faring
forth
for
herself
and
no
one
had
taken
her
her
conception
of
america
had
been
the
untidy
street
in
which
she
lived
and
had
made
her
long
struggle
to
adapt
herself
to
american
ways
but
in
spite
of
some
untoward
experiences
we
were
constantly
impressed
with
the
uniform
kindness
and
courtesy
we
received
perhaps
these
first
days
laid
the
simple
human
foundations
which
are
certainly
essential
for
continuous
living
among
the
poor
first
genuine
preference
for
residence
in
an
industrial
quarter
to
any
other
part
of
the
city
because
it
is
interesting
and
makes
the
human
appeal
and
second
the
conviction
in
the
words
of
canon
barnett
that
the
things
that
make
men
alike
are
finer
and
better
than
the
things
that
keep
them
apart
and
that
these
basic
likenesses
if
they
are
properly
accentuated
easily
transcend
the
less
essential
differences
of
race
language
creed
and
tradition
perhaps
even
in
those
first
days
we
made
a
beginning
toward
that
object
which
was
afterwards
stated
in
our
charter
to
provide
a
center
for
higher
civic
and
social
life
to
institute
and
maintain
educational
and
philanthropic
enterprises
and
to
investigate
and
improve

subjective
necessity
for
social
settlements
the
ethical
culture
societies
held
a
summer
school
at
plymouth
massachusetts
in
to
which
they
invited
several
people
representing
the
then
new
settlement
movement
that
they
might
discuss
with
others
the
general
theme
of
philanthropy
and
social
progress
i
venture
to
produce
here
parts
of
a
lecture
i
delivered
in
plymouth
both
because
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
formulate
with
the
same
freshness
those
early
motives
and
strivings
and
because
when
published
with
other
papers
given
that
summer
it
was
received
by
the
settlement
people
themselves
as
a
satisfactory
statement
i
remember
on
golden
summer
afternoon
during
the
sessions
of
the
summer
school
that
several
of
us
met
on
the
shores
of
a
pond
in
a
pine
wood
a
few
miles
from
plymouth
to
discuss
our
new
movement
the
natural
leader
of
the
group
was
robert
a
woods
he
had
recently
returned
from
a
residence
in
toynbee
hall
london
to
open
andover
house
in
boston
and
had
just
issued
a
book
english
social
movements
in
which
he
had
gathered
together
and
focused
the
many
forms
of
social
endeavor
preceding
and
contemporaneous
with
the
english
settlements
there
were
miss
vida
scudder
and
miss
helena
dudley
from
the
college
settlement
association
miss
julia
lathrop
and
myself
from
some
of
us
had
numbered
our
years
as
far
as
thirty
and
we
all
carefully
avoided
the
extravagance
of
statement
which
characterizes
youth
and
yet
i
doubt
if
anywhere
on
the
continent
that
summer
could
have
been
found
a
group
of
people
more
genuinely
interested
in
social
development
or
more
sincerely
convinced
that
they
had
found
a
clue
by
which
the
conditions
in
crowded
cities
might
be
understood
and
the
agencies
for
social
betterment
developed
we
were
all
careful
to
avoid
saying
that
we
had
found
a
life
work
perhaps
with
an
instinctive
dread
of
expending
all
our
energy
in
vows
of
constancy
as
so
often
happens
and
yet
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
of
all
the
people
whom
i
have
recalled
as
the
enthusiasts
at
that
little
conference
have
remained
attached
to
settlements
in
actual
residence
for
longer
or
shorter
periods
each
year
during
the
eighteen
years
that
have
elapsed
since
then
although
they
have
also
been
closely
identified
as
publicists
or
governmental
officials
with
movements
outside
it
is
as
if
they
had
discovered
that
the
settlement
was
too
valuable
as
a
method
as
a
way
of
approach
to
the
social
question
to
abandoned
although
they
had
long
since
discovered
it
was
not
a
social
movement
in
itself
this
however
is
anticipating
the
future
whereas
the
following
paper
on
the
subjective
necessity
for
social
settlements
should
have
a
chance
to
speak
for
itself
it
is
perhaps
too
late
in
the
day
to
express
regret
for
its
stilted
title
this
paper
is
an
attempt
to
analyze
the
motives
which
underlie
a
movement
based
not
only
upon
conviction
but
upon
genuine
emotion
wherever
educated
young
people
are
seeking
an
outlet
for
that
sentiment
for
universal
brotherhood
which
the
best
spirit
of
our
times
is
forcing
from
an
emotion
into
a
motive
these
young
people
accomplish
little
toward
the
solution
of
this
social
problem
and
bear
the
brunt
of
being
cultivated
into
unnourished
oversensitive
lives
they
have
been
shut
off
from
the
common
labor
by
which
they
live
which
is
a
great
source
of
moral
and
physical
health
they
feel
a
fatal
want
of
harmony
between
their
theory
and
their
lives
a
lack
of
coordination
between
thought
and
action
i
think
it
is
hard
for
us
to
realize
how
seriously
many
of
them
are
taking
to
the
notion
of
human
brotherhood
how
eagerly
they
long
to
give
tangible
expression
to
the
democratic
ideal
these
young
men
and
women
longing
to
socialize
their
democracy
are
animated
by
certain
hopes
which
may
be
thus
loosely
formulated
that
if
in
a
democratic
country
nothing
can
be
permanently
achieved
save
through
the
masses
of
the
people
it
will
be
impossible
to
establish
a
higher
political
life
than
the
people
themselves
crave
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
notion
of
a
higher
civic
life
can
be
fostered
save
through
common
intercourse
that
the
blessings
which
we
associate
with
a
life
of
refinement
and
cultivation
can
be
made
universal
and
must
be
made
universal
if
they
are
to
be
permanent
that
the
good
we
secure
for
ourselves
is
precarious
and
uncertain
is
floating
in
until
it
is
secured
for
all
of
us
and
incorporated
into
our
common
life
it
is
easier
to
state
these
hopes
than
to
formulate
the
line
of
motives
which
i
believe
to
constitute
the
trend
of
the
subjective
pressure
toward
the
settlement
there
is
something
primordial
about
these
motives
but
i
am
perhaps
overbold
in
designating
them
as
a
great
desire
to
share
the
race
life
we
all
bear
traces
of
the
starvation
struggle
which
for
so
long
made
up
the
life
of
the
race
our
very
organism
holds
memories
and
glimpses
of
that
long
life
of
our
ancestors
which
still
goes
on
among
so
many
of
our
contemporaries
nothing
so
deadens
the
sympathies
and
shrivels
the
power
of
enjoyment
as
the
persistent
keeping
away
from
the
great
opportunities
for
helpfulness
and
a
continual
ignoring
of
the
starvation
struggle
which
makes
up
the
life
of
at
least
half
the
race
to
shut
one
self
away
from
that
half
of
the
race
life
is
to
shut
one
self
away
from
the
most
vital
part
of
it
it
is
to
live
out
but
half
the
humanity
to
which
we
have
been
born
heir
and
to
use
but
half
our
faculties
we
have
all
had
longings
for
a
fuller
life
which
should
include
the
use
of
these
faculties
these
longings
are
the
physical
complement
of
the
intimations
of
immortality
on
which
no
ode
has
yet
been
written
to
portray
these
would
be
the
work
of
a
poet
and
it
is
hazardous
for
any
but
a
poet
to
attempt
it
you
may
remember
the
forlorn
feeling
which
occasionally
seizes
you
when
you
arrive
early
in
the
morning
a
stranger
in
a
great
city
the
stream
of
laboring
people
goes
past
you
as
you
gaze
through
the
window
of
your
hotel
you
see
hard
working
men
lifting
great
burdens
you
hear
the
driving
and
jostling
of
huge
carts
and
your
heart
sinks
with
a
sudden
sense
of
futility
the
door
opens
behind
you
and
you
turn
to
the
man
who
brings
you
in
your
breakfast
with
a
quick
sense
of
human
fellowship
you
find
yourself
praying
that
you
may
never
lose
your
hold
on
it
all
a
more
poetic
prayer
would
be
that
the
great
mother
breasts
of
our
common
humanity
with
its
labor
and
suffering
and
its
homely
comforts
may
never
be
withheld
from
you
you
turn
helplessly
to
the
waiter
and
feel
that
it
would
be
almost
grotesque
to
claim
from
him
the
sympathy
you
crave
because
civilization
has
placed
you
apart
but
you
resent
your
position
with
a
sudden
sense
of
snobbery
literature
is
full
of
portrayals
of
these
glimpses
they
come
to
shipwrecked
men
on
rafts
they
overcome
the
differences
of
an
incongruous
multitude
when
in
the
presence
of
a
great
danger
or
when
moved
by
a
common
enthusiasm
they
are
not
however
confined
to
such
moments
and
if
we
were
in
the
habit
of
telling
them
to
each
other
the
recital
would
be
as
long
as
the
tales
of
children
are
when
they
sit
down
on
the
green
grass
and
confide
to
each
other
how
many
times
they
have
remembered
that
they
lived
once
before
if
these
childish
tales
are
the
stirring
of
inherited
impressions
just
so
surely
is
the
other
the
striving
of
inherited
powers
it
is
true
that
there
is
nothing
after
disease
indigence
and
a
sense
of
guilt
so
fatal
to
health
and
to
life
itself
as
the
want
of
a
proper
outlet
for
active
faculties
i
have
seen
young
girls
suffer
and
grow
sensibly
lowered
in
vitality
in
the
first
years
after
they
leave
school
in
our
attempt
then
to
give
a
girl
pleasure
and
freedom
from
care
we
succeed
for
the
most
part
in
making
her
pitifully
miserable
she
finds
life
so
different
from
what
she
expected
it
to
be
she
is
besotted
with
innocent
little
ambitions
and
does
not
understand
this
apparent
waste
of
herself
this
elaborate
preparation
if
no
work
is
provided
for
her
there
is
a
heritage
of
noble
obligation
which
young
people
accept
and
long
to
perpetuate
the
desire
for
action
the
wish
to
right
wrong
and
alleviate
suffering
haunts
them
daily
society
smiles
at
it
indulgently
instead
of
making
it
of
value
to
itself
the
wrong
to
them
begins
even
farther
back
when
we
restrain
the
first
childish
desires
for
doing
good
and
tell
them
that
they
must
wait
until
they
are
older
and
better
fitted
we
intimate
that
social
obligation
begins
at
a
fixed
date
forgetting
that
it
begins
at
birth
itself
we
treat
them
as
children
who
with
limbs
are
allowed
to
use
their
legs
but
not
their
arms
or
whose
legs
are
daily
carefully
exercised
that
after
a
while
their
arms
may
be
put
to
high
use
we
do
this
in
spite
of
the
protest
of
the
best
educators
locke
and
pestalozzi
we
are
fortunate
in
the
meantime
if
their
unused
members
do
not
weaken
and
disappear
they
do
sometimes
there
are
a
few
girls
who
by
the
time
they
are
educated
forget
their
old
childish
desires
to
help
the
world
and
to
play
with
poor
little
girls
who
playthings
parents
are
often
inconsistent
they
deliberately
expose
their
daughters
to
knowledge
of
the
distress
in
the
world
they
send
them
to
hear
missionary
addresses
on
famines
in
india
and
china
they
accompany
them
to
lectures
on
the
suffering
in
siberia
they
agitate
together
over
the
forgotten
region
of
east
london
in
addition
to
this
from
babyhood
the
altruistic
tendencies
of
these
daughters
are
persistently
cultivated
they
are
taught
to
be
and
to
consider
the
good
of
the
whole
before
the
good
of
the
ego
but
when
all
this
information
and
culture
show
results
when
the
daughter
comes
back
from
college
and
begins
to
recognize
her
social
claim
to
the
submerged
tenth
and
to
evince
a
disposition
to
fulfill
it
the
family
claim
is
strenuously
asserted
she
is
told
that
she
is
unjustified
in
her
efforts
if
she
persists
the
family
too
often
are
injured
and
unhappy
unless
the
efforts
are
called
missionary
and
the
religious
zeal
of
the
family
carry
them
over
their
sense
of
abuse
when
this
zeal
does
not
exist
the
result
is
perplexing
it
is
a
curious
violation
of
what
we
would
fain
believe
a
fundamental
law
that
the
final
return
of
the
deed
is
upon
the
head
of
the
doer
the
deed
is
that
of
exclusiveness
and
caution
but
the
return
instead
of
falling
upon
the
head
of
the
exclusive
and
cautious
falls
upon
a
young
head
full
of
generous
and
unselfish
plans
the
girl
loses
something
vital
out
of
her
life
to
which
she
is
entitled
she
is
restricted
and
unhappy
her
elders
meanwhile
are
unconscious
of
the
situation
and
we
have
all
the
elements
of
a
tragedy
we
have
in
america
a
number
of
cultivated
young
people
who
have
no
recognized
outlet
for
their
active
faculties
they
hear
constantly
of
the
great
social
maladjustment
but
no
way
is
provided
for
them
to
change
it
and
their
uselessness
hangs
about
them
heavily
huxley
declares
that
the
sense
of
uselessness
is
the
severest
shock
which
the
human
system
can
sustain
and
that
if
persistently
sustained
it
results
in
atrophy
of
function
these
young
people
have
had
advantages
of
college
of
european
travel
and
of
economic
study
but
they
are
sustaining
this
shock
of
inaction
they
have
pet
phrases
and
they
tell
you
that
the
things
that
make
us
all
alike
are
stronger
than
the
things
that
make
us
different
they
say
that
all
men
are
united
by
needs
and
sympathies
far
more
permanent
and
radical
than
anything
that
temporarily
divides
them
and
sets
them
in
opposition
to
each
other
if
they
affect
art
they
say
that
the
decay
in
artistic
expression
is
due
to
the
decay
in
ethics
that
art
when
shut
away
from
the
human
interests
and
from
the
great
mass
of
humanity
is
they
tell
their
elders
with
all
the
bitterness
of
youth
that
if
they
expect
success
from
them
in
business
or
politics
or
in
whatever
lines
their
ambition
for
them
has
run
they
must
let
them
consult
all
of
humanity
that
they
must
let
them
find
out
what
the
people
want
and
how
they
want
it
it
is
only
the
stronger
young
people
however
who
formulate
this
many
of
them
dissipate
their
energies
in
enjoyment
others
not
content
with
that
go
on
studying
and
go
back
to
college
for
their
second
degrees
not
that
they
are
especially
fond
of
study
but
because
they
want
something
definite
to
do
and
their
powers
have
been
trained
in
the
direction
of
mental
accumulation
many
are
buried
beneath
this
mental
accumulation
with
lowered
vitality
and
discontent
walter
besant
says
they
have
had
the
vision
that
peter
had
when
he
saw
the
great
sheet
let
down
from
heaven
wherein
was
neither
clean
nor
unclean
he
calls
it
the
sense
of
humanity
it
is
not
philanthropy
nor
benevolence
but
a
thing
fuller
and
wider
than
either
of
these
this
young
life
so
sincere
in
its
emotion
and
good
phrases
and
yet
so
undirected
seems
to
me
as
pitiful
as
the
other
great
mass
of
destitute
lives
one
is
supplementary
to
the
other
and
some
method
of
communication
can
surely
be
devised
barnett
who
urged
the
first
settlement
toynbee
hall
in
east
london
recognized
this
need
of
outlet
for
the
young
men
of
oxford
and
cambridge
and
hoped
that
the
settlement
would
supply
the
communication
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the
settlement
movement
originated
in
england
where
the
years
of
education
are
more
constrained
and
definite
than
they
are
here
where
class
distinctions
are
more
rigid
the
necessity
of
it
was
greater
there
but
we
are
fast
feeling
the
pressure
of
the
need
and
meeting
the
necessity
for
settlements
in
america
our
young
people
feel
nervously
the
need
of
putting
theory
into
action
and
respond
quickly
to
the
settlement
form
of
activity
other
motives
which
i
believe
make
toward
the
settlement
are
the
result
of
a
certain
renaissance
going
forward
in
christianity
the
impulse
to
share
the
lives
of
the
poor
the
desire
to
make
social
service
irrespective
of
propaganda
express
the
spirit
of
christ
is
as
old
as
christianity
itself
we
have
no
proof
from
the
records
themselves
that
the
early
roman
christians
who
strained
their
simple
art
to
the
point
of
grotesqueness
in
their
eagerness
to
record
a
good
news
on
the
walls
of
the
catacombs
considered
this
good
news
a
religion
jesus
had
no
set
of
truths
labeled
religious
on
the
contrary
his
doctrine
was
that
all
truth
is
one
that
the
appropriation
of
it
is
freedom
his
teaching
had
no
dogma
to
mark
it
off
from
truth
and
action
in
general
he
himself
called
it
a
revelation
a
life
these
early
roman
christians
received
the
gospel
message
a
command
to
love
all
men
with
a
certain
joyous
simplicity
the
image
of
the
good
shepherd
is
blithe
and
gay
beyond
the
gentlest
shepherd
of
greek
mythology
the
hart
no
longer
pants
but
rushes
to
the
water
brooks
the
christians
looked
for
the
continuous
revelation
but
believed
what
jesus
said
that
this
revelation
to
be
retained
and
made
manifest
must
be
put
into
terms
of
action
that
action
is
the
only
medium
man
has
for
receiving
and
appropriating
truth
that
the
doctrine
must
be
known
through
the
will
that
christianity
has
to
be
revealed
and
embodied
in
the
line
of
social
progress
is
a
corollary
to
the
simple
proposition
that
man
action
is
found
in
his
social
relationships
in
the
way
in
which
he
connects
with
his
fellows
that
his
motives
for
action
are
the
zeal
and
affection
with
which
he
regards
his
fellows
by
this
simple
process
was
created
a
deep
enthusiasm
for
humanity
which
regarded
man
as
at
once
the
organ
and
the
object
of
revelation
and
by
this
process
came
about
the
wonderful
fellowship
the
true
democracy
of
the
early
church
that
so
captivates
the
imagination
the
early
christians
were
preeminently
nonresistant
they
believed
in
love
as
a
cosmic
force
there
was
no
iconoclasm
during
the
minor
peace
of
the
church
they
did
not
yet
denounce
nor
tear
down
temples
nor
preach
the
end
of
the
world
they
grew
to
a
mighty
number
but
it
never
occurred
to
them
either
in
their
weakness
or
in
their
strength
to
regard
other
men
for
an
instant
as
their
foes
or
as
aliens
the
spectacle
of
the
christians
loving
all
men
was
the
most
astounding
rome
had
ever
seen
they
were
eager
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
the
weak
for
children
and
for
the
aged
they
identified
themselves
with
slaves
and
did
not
avoid
the
plague
they
longed
to
share
the
common
lot
that
they
might
receive
the
constant
revelation
it
was
a
new
treasure
which
the
early
christians
added
to
the
sum
of
all
treasures
a
joy
hitherto
unknown
in
the
world
the
joy
of
finding
the
christ
which
lieth
in
each
man
but
which
no
man
can
unfold
save
in
fellowship
a
happiness
ranging
from
the
heroic
to
the
pastoral
enveloped
them
they
were
to
possess
a
revelation
as
long
as
life
had
new
meaning
to
unfold
new
action
to
propose
i
believe
that
there
is
a
distinct
turning
among
many
young
men
and
women
toward
this
simple
acceptance
of
christ
message
they
resent
the
assumption
that
christianity
is
a
set
of
ideas
which
belong
to
the
religious
consciousness
whatever
that
may
be
they
insist
that
it
can
not
be
proclaimed
and
instituted
apart
from
the
social
life
of
the
community
and
that
it
must
seek
a
simple
and
natural
expression
in
the
social
organism
itself
the
settlement
movement
is
only
one
manifestation
of
that
wider
humanitarian
movement
which
throughout
christendom
but
in
england
is
endeavoring
to
embody
itself
not
in
a
sect
but
in
society
itself
i
believe
that
this
turning
this
renaissance
of
the
early
christian
humanitarianism
is
going
on
in
america
in
chicago
if
you
please
without
leaders
who
write
or
philosophize
without
much
speaking
but
with
a
bent
to
express
in
social
service
and
in
terms
of
action
the
spirit
of
christ
certain
it
is
that
spiritual
force
is
found
in
the
settlement
movement
and
it
is
also
true
that
this
force
must
be
evoked
and
must
be
called
into
play
before
the
success
of
any
settlement
is
assured
there
must
be
the
overmastering
belief
that
all
that
is
noblest
in
life
is
common
to
men
as
men
in
order
to
accentuate
the
likenesses
and
ignore
the
differences
which
are
found
among
the
people
whom
the
settlement
constantly
brings
into
juxtaposition
it
may
be
true
as
the
positivists
insist
that
the
very
religious
fervor
of
man
can
be
turned
into
love
for
his
race
and
his
desire
for
a
future
life
into
content
to
live
in
the
echo
of
his
deeds
paul
formula
of
seeking
for
the
christ
which
lieth
in
each
man
and
founding
our
likenesses
on
him
seems
a
simpler
formula
to
many
of
us
in
a
thousand
voices
singing
the
hallelujah
chorus
in
messiah
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
the
leading
voices
but
the
differences
of
training
and
cultivation
between
them
and
the
voices
in
the
chorus
are
lost
in
the
unity
of
purpose
and
in
the
fact
that
they
are
all
human
voices
lifted
by
a
high
motive
this
is
a
weak
illustration
of
what
a
settlement
attempts
to
do
it
aims
in
a
measure
to
develop
whatever
of
social
life
its
neighborhood
may
afford
to
focus
and
give
form
to
that
life
to
bring
to
bear
upon
it
the
results
of
cultivation
and
training
but
it
receives
in
exchange
for
the
music
of
isolated
voices
the
volume
and
strength
of
the
chorus
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
say
in
what
proportion
or
degree
the
subjective
necessity
which
led
to
the
opening
of
combined
the
three
trends
first
the
desire
to
interpret
democracy
in
social
terms
secondly
the
impulse
beating
at
the
very
source
of
our
lives
urging
us
to
aid
in
the
race
progress
and
thirdly
the
christian
movement
toward
humanitarianism
it
is
difficult
to
analyze
a
living
thing
the
analysis
is
at
best
imperfect
many
more
motives
may
blend
with
the
three
trends
possibly
the
desire
for
a
new
form
of
social
success
due
to
the
nicety
of
imagination
which
refuses
worldly
pleasures
unmixed
with
the
joys
of
possibly
a
love
of
approbation
so
vast
that
it
is
not
content
with
the
treble
clapping
of
delicate
hands
but
wishes
also
to
hear
the
bass
notes
from
toughened
palms
may
mingle
with
these
the
settlement
then
is
an
experimental
effort
to
aid
in
the
solution
of
the
social
and
industrial
problems
which
are
engendered
by
the
modern
conditions
of
life
in
a
great
city
it
insists
that
these
problems
are
not
confined
to
any
one
portion
of
a
city
it
is
an
attempt
to
relieve
at
the
same
time
the
overaccumulation
at
one
end
of
society
and
the
destitution
at
the
other
but
it
assumes
that
this
overaccumulation
and
destitution
is
most
sorely
felt
in
the
things
that
pertain
to
social
and
educational
privileges
from
its
very
nature
it
can
stand
for
no
political
or
social
propaganda
it
must
in
a
sense
give
the
warm
welcome
of
an
inn
to
all
such
propaganda
if
perchance
one
of
them
be
found
an
angel
the
only
thing
to
be
dreaded
in
the
settlement
is
that
it
lose
its
flexibility
its
power
of
quick
adaptation
its
readiness
to
change
its
methods
as
its
environment
may
demand
it
must
be
open
to
conviction
and
must
have
a
deep
and
abiding
sense
of
tolerance
it
must
be
hospitable
and
ready
for
experiment
it
should
demand
from
its
residents
a
scientific
patience
in
the
accumulation
of
facts
and
the
steady
holding
of
their
sympathies
as
one
of
the
best
instruments
for
that
accumulation
it
must
be
grounded
in
a
philosophy
whose
foundation
is
on
the
solidarity
of
the
human
race
a
philosophy
which
will
not
waver
when
the
race
happens
to
be
represented
by
a
drunken
woman
or
an
idiot
boy
its
residents
must
be
emptied
of
all
conceit
of
opinion
and
all
and
ready
to
arouse
and
interpret
the
public
opinion
of
their
neighborhood
they
must
be
content
to
live
quietly
side
by
side
with
their
neighbors
until
they
grow
into
a
sense
of
relationship
and
mutual
interests
their
neighbors
are
held
apart
by
differences
of
race
and
language
which
the
residents
can
more
easily
overcome
they
are
bound
to
see
the
needs
of
their
neighborhood
as
a
whole
to
furnish
data
for
legislation
and
to
use
their
influence
to
secure
it
in
short
residents
are
pledged
to
devote
themselves
to
the
duties
of
good
citizenship
and
to
the
arousing
of
the
social
energies
which
too
largely
lie
dormant
in
every
neighborhood
given
over
to
industrialism
they
are
bound
to
regard
the
entire
life
of
their
city
as
organic
to
make
an
effort
to
unify
it
and
to
protest
against
its
it
is
always
easy
to
make
all
philosophy
point
one
particular
moral
and
all
history
adorn
one
particular
tale
but
i
may
be
forgiven
the
reminder
that
the
best
speculative
philosophy
sets
forth
the
solidarity
of
the
human
race
that
the
highest
moralists
have
taught
that
without
the
advance
and
improvement
of
the
whole
no
man
can
hope
for
any
lasting
improvement
in
his
own
moral
or
material
individual
condition
and
that
the
subjective
necessity
for
social
settlements
is
therefore
identical
with
that
necessity
which
urges
us
on
toward
social
and
individual
salvation

some
early
undertakings
at
if
the
early
american
settlements
stood
for
a
more
exigent
standard
in
philanthropic
activities
insisting
that
each
new
undertaking
should
be
preceded
by
carefully
ascertained
facts
then
certainly
held
to
this
standard
in
the
opening
of
our
new
first
started
as
a
public
kitchen
an
investigation
of
the
sweatshops
had
disclosed
the
fact
that
sewing
women
during
the
busy
season
paid
little
attention
to
the
feeding
of
their
families
for
it
was
only
by
working
steadily
through
the
long
day
that
the
scanty
pay
of
five
seven
or
nine
cents
for
finishing
a
dozen
pairs
of
trousers
could
be
made
into
a
day
wage
and
they
bought
from
the
nearest
grocery
the
canned
goods
that
could
be
most
quickly
heated
or
gave
a
few
pennies
to
the
children
with
which
they
might
secure
a
lunch
from
a
neighboring
candy
shop
one
of
the
residents
made
an
investigation
at
the
instance
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
into
the
food
values
of
the
dietaries
of
the
various
immigrants
and
this
was
followed
by
an
investigation
made
by
another
resident
for
the
united
states
department
of
labor
into
the
foods
of
the
italian
colony
on
the
supposition
that
the
constant
use
of
imported
products
bore
a
distinct
relation
to
the
cost
of
living
i
recall
an
italian
who
coming
into
one
day
as
we
were
sitting
at
the
dinner
table
expressed
great
surprise
that
americans
ate
a
variety
of
food
because
he
believed
that
they
partook
only
of
potatoes
and
beer
a
little
inquiry
showed
that
this
conclusion
was
drawn
from
the
fact
that
he
lived
next
to
an
irish
saloon
and
had
never
seen
anything
but
potatoes
going
in
and
beer
coming
out
at
that
time
the
new
england
kitchen
was
comparatively
new
in
boston
and
richards
who
was
largely
responsible
for
its
foundation
hoped
that
cheaper
cuts
of
meat
and
simpler
vegetables
if
they
were
subjected
to
slow
and
thorough
processes
of
cooking
might
be
made
attractive
and
their
nutritive
value
secured
for
the
people
who
so
sadly
needed
more
nutritious
food
it
was
felt
that
this
could
be
best
accomplished
in
public
kitchens
where
the
advantage
of
scientific
training
and
careful
supervision
could
be
secured
one
of
the
residents
went
to
boston
for
a
training
under
richards
and
when
the
kitchen
was
fitted
under
her
guidance
and
direction
our
hopes
ran
high
for
some
modification
of
the
food
of
the
neighborhood
we
did
not
reckon
however
with
the
wide
diversity
in
nationality
and
inherited
tastes
and
while
we
sold
a
certain
amount
of
the
carefully
prepared
soups
and
stews
in
the
boring
factories
a
sale
which
has
steadily
increased
throughout
the
years
and
were
also
patronized
by
a
few
households
perhaps
the
neighborhood
estimate
was
best
summed
up
by
the
woman
who
frankly
confessed
that
the
food
was
certainly
nutritious
but
that
she
did
like
to
eat
what
was
nutritious
that
she
liked
to
eat
what
she
ruther
if
the
dietetics
were
appreciated
but
slowly
the
social
value
of
the
and
the
gymnasium
which
were
in
the
same
building
were
quickly
demonstrated
at
that
time
the
saloon
halls
were
the
only
places
in
the
neighborhood
where
the
immigrant
could
hold
his
social
gatherings
and
where
he
could
celebrate
such
innocent
and
legitimate
occasions
as
weddings
and
christenings
these
halls
were
rented
very
cheaply
with
the
understanding
that
various
sums
of
money
should
be
passed
across
the
bar
and
it
was
considered
a
mean
host
or
guest
who
failed
to
live
up
to
this
implied
bargain
the
consequence
was
that
many
a
reputable
party
ended
with
a
certain
amount
of
disorder
due
solely
to
the
fact
that
the
social
instinct
was
traded
upon
and
used
as
a
basis
for
money
making
by
an
adroit
host
from
the
beginning
the
young
people
clubs
had
asked
for
dancing
and
nothing
was
more
popular
than
the
increased
space
for
parties
offered
by
the
gymnasium
with
the
chance
to
serve
refreshments
in
the
room
below
we
tried
experiments
with
every
known
soft
drink
from
those
extracted
from
an
expensive
soda
water
fountain
to
slender
glasses
of
grape
juice
but
so
far
as
drinks
were
concerned
we
never
became
a
rival
to
the
saloon
nor
indeed
did
anyone
imagine
that
we
were
trying
to
do
so
i
remember
one
man
who
looked
about
the
cozy
little
room
and
said
this
would
be
a
nice
place
to
sit
in
all
day
if
one
could
only
have
beer
but
the
gradually
performed
a
mission
of
its
own
and
became
something
of
a
social
center
to
the
neighborhood
as
well
as
a
real
convenience
business
men
from
the
adjacent
factories
and
school
teachers
from
the
nearest
public
schools
used
it
increasingly
the
students
and
club
members
supped
together
in
little
groups
or
held
their
reunions
and
social
banquets
as
to
a
certain
extent
did
organizations
from
all
parts
of
the
town
the
experience
of
the
taught
us
not
to
hold
to
preconceived
ideas
of
what
the
neighborhood
ought
to
have
but
to
keep
ourselves
in
readiness
to
modify
and
adapt
our
undertakings
as
we
discovered
those
things
which
the
neighborhood
was
ready
to
accept
better
food
was
doubtless
needed
but
more
attractive
and
safer
places
for
social
gatherings
were
also
needed
and
the
neighborhood
was
ready
for
one
and
not
for
the
other
we
had
no
hint
then
in
chicago
of
the
small
parks
which
were
to
be
established
fifteen
years
later
containing
the
halls
for
dancing
and
their
own
restaurants
in
buildings
where
the
natural
desire
of
the
young
for
gayety
and
social
organization
could
be
safely
indulged
yet
even
in
that
early
day
a
member
of
the
men
club
who
had
been
appointed
superintendent
of
douglas
park
had
secured
there
the
first
public
swimming
pool
and
his
fellow
club
members
were
proud
of
the
achievement
there
was
in
the
earliest
undertakings
at
a
touch
of
the
artist
enthusiasm
when
he
translates
his
inner
vision
through
his
chosen
material
into
outward
form
keenly
conscious
of
the
social
confusion
all
about
us
and
the
hard
economic
struggle
we
at
times
believed
that
the
very
struggle
itself
might
become
a
source
of
strength
the
devotion
of
the
mothers
to
their
children
the
dread
of
the
men
lest
they
fail
to
provide
for
the
family
dependent
upon
their
daily
exertions
at
moments
seemed
to
us
the
secret
stores
of
strength
from
which
society
is
fed
the
invisible
array
of
passion
and
feeling
which
are
the
surest
protectors
of
the
world
we
fatuously
hoped
that
we
might
pluck
from
the
human
tragedy
itself
a
consciousness
of
a
common
destiny
which
should
bring
its
own
healing
that
we
might
extract
from
life
very
misfortunes
a
power
of
cooperation
which
should
be
effective
against
them
of
course
there
was
always
present
the
harrowing
consciousness
of
the
difference
in
economic
condition
between
ourselves
and
our
neighbors
even
if
we
had
gone
to
live
in
the
most
wretched
tenement
there
would
have
always
been
an
essential
difference
between
them
and
ourselves
for
we
should
have
had
a
sense
of
security
in
regard
to
illness
and
old
age
and
the
lack
of
these
two
securities
are
the
specters
which
most
persistently
haunt
the
poor
could
we
in
spite
of
this
make
their
individual
efforts
more
effective
through
organization
and
possibly
complement
them
by
small
efforts
of
our
own
some
such
vague
hope
was
in
our
minds
when
we
started
the
cooperative
coal
association
which
led
a
vigorous
life
for
three
years
and
developed
a
large
membership
under
the
skillful
advice
of
its
one
paid
officer
an
english
workingman
who
had
had
experience
in
cooperative
societies
at
some
of
the
meetings
of
the
association
in
which
people
met
to
consider
together
their
basic
dependence
upon
fire
and
warmth
had
a
curious
challenge
of
life
about
them
because
the
cooperators
knew
what
it
meant
to
bring
forth
children
in
the
midst
of
privation
and
to
see
the
tiny
creatures
struggle
for
life
their
recitals
cut
a
cross
section
as
it
were
in
that
effort
the
dying
to
live
which
so
inevitably
triumphs
over
poverty
and
suffering
and
yet
their
very
familiarity
with
hardship
may
have
been
responsible
for
that
sentiment
which
traditionally
ruins
business
for
a
vote
of
the
cooperators
that
the
basket
buyers
be
given
one
basket
free
out
of
every
six
that
the
presentation
of
five
purchase
tickets
should
entitle
the
holders
to
a
profit
in
coal
instead
of
stock
because
it
would
be
a
shame
to
keep
them
waiting
for
the
dividend
was
always
pointed
to
by
the
conservative
buyers
as
the
beginning
of
the
end
at
any
rate
at
the
close
of
the
third
winter
although
the
association
occupied
an
imposing
coal
yard
on
the
southeast
corner
of
the
block
and
its
gross
receipts
were
between
three
and
four
hundred
dollars
a
day
it
became
evident
that
the
concern
could
not
remain
solvent
if
it
continued
its
philanthropic
policy
and
the
experiment
was
terminated
by
the
cooperators
taking
up
their
stock
in
the
remaining
coal
our
next
cooperative
experiment
was
much
more
successful
perhaps
because
it
was
much
more
spontaneous
at
a
meeting
of
working
girls
held
at
during
a
strike
in
a
large
shoe
factory
the
discussions
made
it
clear
that
the
strikers
who
had
been
most
easily
frightened
and
therefore
first
to
capitulate
were
naturally
those
girls
who
were
paying
board
and
were
afraid
of
being
put
out
if
they
fell
too
far
behind
after
a
recital
of
a
case
of
peculiar
hardship
one
of
them
exclaimed
would
it
be
fine
if
we
had
a
boarding
club
of
our
own
and
then
we
could
stand
by
each
other
in
a
time
like
this
after
that
events
moved
quickly
we
read
aloud
together
beatrice
potter
little
book
on
cooperation
and
discussed
all
the
difficulties
and
fascinations
of
such
an
undertaking
and
on
the
first
of
may
two
comfortable
apartments
near
were
rented
and
furnished
the
settlement
was
responsible
for
the
furniture
and
paid
the
first
month
rent
but
beyond
that
the
members
managed
the
club
themselves
the
undertaking
marched
as
the
french
say
from
the
very
first
and
always
on
its
own
feet
although
there
were
difficulties
none
of
them
proved
insurmountable
which
was
a
matter
for
great
satisfaction
in
the
face
of
a
statement
made
by
the
head
of
the
united
states
department
of
labor
who
on
a
visit
to
the
club
when
it
was
but
two
years
old
said
that
his
department
had
investigated
many
cooperative
undertakings
and
that
none
founded
and
managed
by
women
had
ever
succeeded
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
the
club
occupied
all
of
the
six
apartments
which
the
original
building
contained
and
numbered
fifty
members
it
was
in
connection
with
our
efforts
to
secure
a
building
for
the
jane
club
that
we
first
found
ourselves
in
the
dilemma
between
the
needs
of
our
neighbors
and
the
response
upon
which
we
had
already
come
to
rely
for
their
relief
the
adapted
apartments
in
which
the
jane
club
was
housed
were
inevitably
more
or
less
uncomfortable
and
we
felt
that
the
success
of
the
club
justified
the
erection
of
a
building
for
its
sole
use
up
to
that
time
our
history
had
been
as
the
minor
peace
of
the
early
church
we
had
had
the
most
generous
interpretation
of
our
efforts
of
course
many
people
were
indifferent
to
the
idea
of
the
settlement
others
looked
on
with
tolerant
and
sometimes
cynical
amusement
which
we
would
often
encounter
in
a
good
story
related
at
our
expense
but
all
this
was
remote
and
unreal
to
us
and
we
were
sure
that
if
the
critics
could
but
touch
the
life
of
the
people
they
would
understand
the
situation
changed
markedly
after
the
pullman
strike
and
our
efforts
to
secure
factory
legislation
later
brought
upon
us
a
certain
amount
of
distrust
and
suspicion
until
then
we
had
been
considered
merely
a
kindly
philanthropic
undertaking
whose
new
form
gave
us
a
certain
idealistic
glamour
but
sterner
tests
were
coming
and
one
of
the
first
was
in
connection
with
the
new
building
for
the
jane
club
a
trustee
of
came
to
see
us
one
day
with
the
good
news
that
a
friend
of
his
was
ready
to
give
twenty
thousand
dollars
with
which
to
build
the
desired
new
clubhouse
when
however
he
divulged
the
name
of
his
generous
friend
it
proved
to
be
that
of
a
man
who
was
notorious
for
underpaying
the
girls
in
his
establishment
and
concerning
whom
there
were
even
darker
stories
it
seemed
clearly
impossible
to
erect
a
clubhouse
for
working
girls
with
such
money
and
we
at
once
said
that
we
must
decline
the
offer
the
trustee
of
was
put
in
the
most
embarrassing
situation
he
had
of
course
induced
the
man
to
give
the
money
and
had
had
no
thought
but
that
it
would
be
eagerly
received
he
would
now
be
obliged
to
return
with
the
astonishing
not
to
say
insulting
news
that
the
money
was
considered
unfit
in
the
long
discussion
which
followed
it
gradually
became
clear
to
all
of
us
that
such
a
refusal
could
be
valuable
only
as
it
might
reveal
to
the
man
himself
and
to
others
public
opinion
in
regard
to
certain
methods
of
but
that
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
our
refusal
of
this
money
could
not
be
made
public
because
a
representative
of
had
asked
for
it
however
the
basic
fact
remained
that
we
could
not
accept
the
money
and
of
this
the
trustee
himself
was
fully
convinced
this
incident
occurred
during
a
period
of
much
discussion
concerning
tainted
money
and
is
perhaps
typical
of
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
it
it
is
impossible
to
know
how
far
we
may
blame
the
individual
for
doing
that
which
all
of
his
competitors
and
his
associates
consider
legitimate
at
the
same
time
social
changes
can
only
be
inaugurated
by
those
who
feel
the
unrighteousness
of
contemporary
conditions
and
the
expression
of
their
scruples
may
be
the
one
opportunity
for
pushing
forward
moral
tests
into
that
dubious
area
wherein
wealth
is
accumulated
in
the
course
of
time
a
new
clubhouse
was
built
by
an
old
friend
of
much
interested
in
working
girls
and
this
has
been
occupied
for
twelve
years
by
the
very
successful
cooperating
jane
club
the
incident
of
the
early
refusal
is
associated
in
my
mind
with
a
long
talk
upon
the
subject
of
questionable
money
i
held
with
the
warden
of
toynbee
hall
whom
i
visited
at
bristol
where
he
was
then
canon
in
the
cathedral
by
way
of
illustration
he
showed
me
a
beautiful
little
church
which
had
been
built
by
the
last
merchant
in
bristol
who
had
been
much
disapproved
of
by
his
fellow
townsmen
and
had
hoped
by
this
transmutation
of
money
into
exquisite
gothic
architecture
to
reconcile
himself
both
to
god
and
man
his
impulse
to
build
may
have
been
born
from
his
own
scruples
or
from
the
quickened
consciences
of
his
neighbors
who
saw
that
the
iniquity
of
enslaving
men
must
at
length
come
to
an
end
the
abolitionists
may
have
regarded
this
beautiful
building
as
the
fruit
of
a
contrite
heart
or
they
may
have
scorned
it
as
an
attempt
to
magnify
the
goodness
of
a
slave
trader
and
thus
perplex
the
doubting
citizens
of
bristol
in
regard
to
the
entire
moral
issue
canon
barnett
did
not
pronounce
judgment
on
the
bristol
merchant
he
was
however
quite
clear
upon
the
point
that
a
higher
moral
standard
for
industrial
life
must
be
embodied
in
legislation
as
rapidly
as
possible
that
it
may
bear
equally
upon
all
and
that
an
individual
endeavoring
to
secure
this
legislation
must
forbear
harsh
judgment
this
was
doubtless
a
sound
position
but
during
all
the
period
of
hot
discussion
concerning
tainted
money
i
never
felt
clear
enough
on
the
general
principle
involved
to
accept
the
many
invitations
to
write
and
speak
upon
the
subject
although
i
received
much
instruction
in
the
many
letters
of
disapproval
sent
to
me
by
radicals
of
various
schools
because
i
was
a
member
of
the
university
extension
staff
of
the
then
new
university
of
chicago
the
righteousness
of
whose
foundation
they
challenged
a
little
incident
of
this
time
illustrated
to
me
the
confusion
in
the
minds
of
a
least
many
older
men
between
religious
teaching
and
advancing
morality
one
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
the
head
of
a
settlement
in
new
york
expressing
his
perplexity
over
the
fact
that
his
board
of
trustees
had
asked
money
from
a
man
notorious
for
his
unscrupulous
business
methods
my
correspondent
had
placed
his
resignation
in
the
hands
of
his
board
that
they
might
accept
it
at
any
time
when
they
felt
his
utterances
on
the
subject
of
tainted
money
were
offensive
for
he
wished
to
be
free
to
openly
discuss
a
subject
of
such
grave
moral
import
the
very
morning
when
my
mind
was
full
of
the
questions
raised
by
this
letter
i
received
a
call
from
the
daughter
of
the
same
business
man
whom
my
friend
considered
so
unscrupulous
she
was
passing
through
chicago
and
came
to
ask
me
to
give
her
some
arguments
which
she
might
later
use
with
her
father
to
confute
the
charge
that
settlements
were
irreligious
she
said
you
see
he
has
been
asked
to
give
money
to
our
settlement
and
would
like
to
do
it
if
his
conscience
was
only
clear
he
disapproves
of
settlements
because
they
give
no
religious
instruction
he
has
always
been
a
very
devout
man
i
remember
later
discussing
the
incident
with
washington
gladden
who
was
able
to
parallel
it
from
his
own
experience
now
that
this
discussion
upon
tainted
money
has
subsided
it
is
easy
to
view
it
with
a
certain
detachment
impossible
at
the
moment
and
it
is
even
difficult
to
understand
why
the
feeling
should
have
been
so
intense
although
it
doubtless
registered
genuine
moral
concern
there
was
room
for
discouragement
in
the
many
unsuccessful
experiments
in
cooperation
which
were
carried
on
in
chicago
during
the
early
nineties
a
carpenter
shop
on
van
buren
street
near
halsted
a
labor
exchange
started
by
the
unemployed
not
so
paradoxical
an
arrangement
as
it
seems
and
a
very
ambitious
plan
for
a
country
colony
which
was
finally
carried
out
at
ruskin
tennessee
in
spite
of
failures
cooperative
schemes
went
on
some
of
the
same
men
appearing
in
one
after
another
with
irrepressible
optimism
i
remember
during
a
cooperative
congress
which
met
at
in
the
world
fair
summer
that
henry
lloyd
who
collected
records
of
cooperative
experiments
with
the
enthusiasm
with
which
other
men
collect
coins
or
pictures
put
before
the
congress
some
of
the
remarkable
successes
in
ireland
and
north
england
which
he
later
embodied
in
his
book
on
copartnership
one
of
the
cooperators
denounced
the
modern
method
as
too
much
like
business
and
declared
himself
in
favor
of
principles
which
may
have
failed
over
and
over
again
but
are
nevertheless
as
sound
as
the
law
of
gravitation
lloyd
and
i
agreed
that
the
fiery
old
man
presented
as
fine
a
spectacle
of
devotion
to
a
lost
cause
as
either
of
us
had
ever
seen
although
we
both
possessed
memories
well
stored
with
such
romantic
attachments
and
yet
this
dream
that
men
shall
cease
to
waste
strength
in
competition
and
shall
come
to
pool
their
powers
of
production
is
coming
to
pass
all
over
the
face
of
the
earth
five
years
later
in
the
same
hall
in
which
the
cooperative
congress
was
held
an
italian
senator
told
a
large
audience
of
his
fellow
countrymen
of
the
successful
system
of
cooperative
banks
in
north
italy
and
of
their
cooperative
methods
of
selling
produce
to
the
value
of
millions
of
francs
annually
still
later
sir
horace
plunkett
related
the
remarkable
successes
in
cooperation
in
ireland
i
have
seldom
been
more
infected
by
enthusiasm
than
i
once
was
in
dulwich
at
a
meeting
of
english
cooperators
where
i
was
fairly
overwhelmed
by
the
fervor
underlying
the
businesslike
proceedings
of
the
congress
and
certainly
when
i
served
as
a
juror
in
the
paris
exposition
of
nothing
in
the
entire
display
in
the
department
of
social
economy
was
so
imposing
as
the
building
housing
the
exhibit
which
had
been
erected
by
cooperative
without
the
assistance
of
a
single
contractor
and
so
one
faith
is
kept
alive
as
one
occasionally
meets
a
realized
ideal
of
better
human
relations
at
least
traces
of
successful
cooperation
are
found
even
in
individualistic
america
i
recall
my
enthusiasm
on
the
day
when
i
set
forth
to
lecture
at
new
harmony
indiana
for
i
had
early
been
thrilled
by
the
tale
of
robert
owen
as
every
young
person
must
be
who
is
interested
in
social
reform
i
was
delighted
to
find
so
much
of
his
spirit
still
clinging
to
the
little
town
which
had
long
ago
held
one
of
his
ardent
experiments
although
the
poor
old
cooperators
who
for
many
years
claimed
friendship
at
because
they
heard
that
we
had
once
tried
a
cooperative
coal
association
might
well
have
convinced
me
of
the
persistency
of
the
cooperative
ideal
many
experiences
in
those
early
years
although
vivid
seemed
to
contain
no
illumination
nevertheless
they
doubtless
permanently
affected
our
judgments
concerning
what
is
called
crime
and
vice
i
recall
a
series
of
striking
episodes
on
the
day
when
i
took
the
wife
and
child
as
well
as
the
old
godfather
of
an
italian
convict
to
visit
him
in
the
state
penitentiary
when
we
approached
the
prison
the
sight
of
its
heavy
stone
walls
and
armed
sentries
threw
the
godfather
into
a
paroxysm
of
rage
he
cast
his
hat
upon
the
ground
and
stamped
upon
it
tore
his
hair
and
loudly
fulminated
in
weird
italian
oaths
until
one
of
the
guards
seeing
his
strange
actions
came
to
inquire
if
the
gentleman
was
having
a
fit
when
we
finally
saw
the
convict
his
wife
to
my
extreme
distress
talked
of
nothing
but
his
striped
clothing
until
the
poor
man
wept
with
chagrin
upon
our
return
journey
to
chicago
the
little
son
aged
eight
presented
me
with
two
oranges
so
affectionately
and
gayly
that
i
was
filled
with
reflections
upon
the
advantage
of
each
generation
making
a
fresh
start
when
the
train
boy
finding
the
stolen
fruit
in
my
lap
violently
threatened
to
arrest
the
child
but
stranger
than
any
episode
was
the
fact
itself
that
neither
the
convict
his
wife
nor
his
godfather
for
a
moment
considered
him
a
criminal
he
had
merely
gotten
excited
over
cards
and
had
stabbed
his
adversary
with
a
knife
why
should
a
man
who
took
his
luck
badly
be
kept
forever
from
the
sun
was
their
reiterated
inquiry
i
recall
our
perplexity
over
the
first
girls
who
had
gone
astray
the
poor
little
forlorn
objects
fifteen
and
sixteen
years
old
with
their
moral
natures
apparently
untouched
and
unawakened
one
of
them
whom
the
police
had
found
in
a
professional
house
and
asked
us
to
shelter
for
a
few
days
until
she
could
be
used
as
a
witness
was
clutching
a
battered
doll
which
she
had
kept
with
her
during
her
six
months
of
an
evil
life
two
of
these
prematurely
aged
children
came
to
us
one
day
directly
from
the
maternity
ward
of
the
cook
county
hospital
each
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
asking
for
protection
because
they
did
not
want
to
go
home
for
fear
of
being
licked
for
them
were
no
jewels
nor
idle
living
such
as
the
storybooks
portrayed
the
first
of
the
older
women
whom
i
knew
came
to
to
ask
that
her
young
sister
who
was
about
to
arrive
from
germany
might
live
near
us
she
wished
to
find
her
respectable
work
and
wanted
her
to
have
the
decent
pleasures
that
afforded
after
the
arrangement
had
been
completed
and
i
had
in
a
measure
recovered
from
my
astonishment
at
the
businesslike
way
in
which
she
spoke
of
her
own
life
i
ventured
to
ask
her
history
in
a
very
few
words
she
told
me
that
she
had
come
from
germany
as
a
music
teacher
to
an
american
family
at
the
end
of
two
years
in
order
to
avoid
a
scandal
involving
the
head
of
the
house
she
had
come
to
chicago
where
her
child
was
born
but
when
the
remittances
ceased
after
its
death
finding
herself
without
home
and
resources
she
had
gradually
become
involved
in
her
present
mode
of
life
by
dint
of
utilizing
her
family
solicitude
we
finally
induced
her
to
move
into
decent
lodgings
before
her
sister
arrived
and
for
a
difficult
year
she
supported
herself
by
her
exquisite
embroidery
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
gave
up
the
struggle
the
more
easily
as
her
young
sister
well
established
in
the
dressmaking
department
of
a
large
shop
had
begun
to
suspect
her
past
life
but
discouraging
as
these
and
other
similar
efforts
often
were
nevertheless
the
difficulties
were
infinitely
less
in
those
days
when
we
dealt
with
fallen
girls
than
in
the
years
following
when
the
white
slave
traffic
became
gradually
established
and
when
agonized
parents
as
well
as
the
victims
themselves
were
totally
unable
to
account
for
the
situation
in
the
light
of
recent
disclosures
it
seems
as
if
we
were
unaccountably
dull
not
to
have
seen
what
was
happening
especially
to
the
jewish
girls
among
whom
the
home
trade
of
the
white
slave
traffic
was
first
carried
on
and
who
were
thus
made
to
break
through
countless
generations
of
chastity
we
early
encountered
the
difficulties
of
that
old
problem
of
restoring
the
woman
or
even
the
child
into
the
society
she
has
once
outraged
i
well
remember
our
perplexity
when
we
attempted
to
help
two
girls
straight
from
a
virginia
tobacco
factory
who
had
been
decoyed
into
a
disreputable
house
when
innocently
seeking
a
lodging
on
the
late
evening
of
their
arrival
although
they
had
been
rescued
promptly
the
stigma
remained
and
we
found
it
impossible
to
permit
them
to
join
any
of
the
social
clubs
connected
with
not
so
much
because
there
was
danger
of
contamination
as
because
the
parents
of
the
club
members
would
have
resented
their
presence
most
hotly
one
of
our
trustees
succeeded
in
persuading
a
repentant
girl
fourteen
years
old
whom
we
tried
to
give
a
fresh
start
in
another
part
of
the
city
to
attend
a
sunday
school
class
of
a
large
chicago
church
the
trustee
hoped
that
the
contact
with
nice
girls
as
well
as
the
moral
training
would
help
the
poor
child
on
her
hard
road
but
unfortunately
tales
of
her
shortcomings
reached
the
superintendent
who
felt
obliged
in
order
to
protect
the
other
girls
to
forbid
her
the
school
she
came
back
to
tell
us
about
it
defiant
as
well
as
discouraged
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
experience
with
our
own
clubs
we
could
easily
have
joined
her
indignation
over
a
church
which
acted
as
if
its
sunday
school
was
a
show
window
for
candy
kids
in
spite
of
poignant
experiences
or
perhaps
because
of
them
the
memory
of
the
first
years
at
is
more
or
less
blurred
with
fatigue
for
we
could
of
course
become
accustomed
only
gradually
to
the
unending
activity
and
to
the
confusion
of
a
house
constantly
filling
and
refilling
with
groups
of
people
the
little
children
who
came
to
the
kindergarten
in
the
morning
were
followed
by
the
afternoon
clubs
of
older
children
and
those
in
turn
made
way
for
the
educational
and
social
organizations
of
adults
occupying
every
room
in
the
house
every
evening
all
one
habits
of
living
had
to
be
readjusted
and
any
tendency
to
sit
with
a
book
by
the
fire
was
of
necessity
definitely
abandoned
to
thus
renounce
the
luxury
of
personal
preference
was
however
a
mere
trifle
compared
to
our
perplexity
over
the
problems
of
an
industrial
neighborhood
situated
in
an
unorganized
city
life
pressed
hard
in
many
directions
and
yet
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
rather
interesting
that
when
we
were
so
distressed
over
its
stern
aspects
and
so
impressed
with
the
lack
of
municipal
regulations
the
first
building
erected
for
should
have
been
designed
for
an
art
gallery
for
although
it
contained
a
on
the
first
floor
and
a
studio
above
the
largest
space
on
the
second
floor
was
carefully
designed
and
lighted
for
art
exhibits
which
had
to
do
only
with
the
cultivation
of
that
which
appealed
to
the
powers
of
enjoyment
as
over
against
a
capacity
it
was
also
significant
that
a
chicago
business
man
fond
of
pictures
himself
responded
to
this
first
appeal
of
the
new
and
certainly
puzzling
undertaking
called
a
settlement
the
situation
was
somewhat
complicated
by
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
building
was
erected
in
our
free
lease
of
the
land
upon
which
stood
expired
in
the
donor
of
the
building
however
overcame
the
difficulty
by
simply
calling
his
gift
a
donation
of
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
this
restriction
of
course
necessitated
the
simplest
sort
of
a
structure
although
i
remember
on
the
exciting
day
when
the
new
building
was
promised
to
us
that
i
looked
up
my
european
notebook
which
contained
the
record
of
my
experience
in
ulm
hoping
that
i
might
find
a
description
of
what
i
then
thought
a
cathedral
of
humanity
ought
to
be
the
description
was
low
and
widespreading
as
to
include
all
men
in
fellowship
and
mutual
responsibility
even
as
the
older
pinnacles
and
spires
indicated
communion
with
god
the
description
did
not
prove
of
value
as
an
architectural
motive
i
am
afraid
although
the
architects
who
have
remained
our
friends
through
all
the
years
performed
marvels
with
a
combination
of
complicated
demands
and
little
money
at
the
moment
when
i
read
this
girlish
outbreak
it
gave
me
much
comfort
for
in
those
days
in
addition
to
our
other
perplexities
was
often
called
irreligious
these
first
buildings
were
very
precious
to
us
and
it
afforded
us
the
greatest
pride
and
pleasure
as
one
building
after
another
was
added
to
the
group
they
clothed
in
brick
and
mortar
and
made
visible
to
the
world
that
which
we
were
trying
to
do
they
stated
to
chicago
that
education
and
recreation
ought
to
be
extended
to
the
immigrants
the
boys
came
in
great
numbers
to
our
provisional
gymnasium
fitted
up
in
a
former
saloon
and
it
seemed
to
us
quite
as
natural
that
a
chicago
man
fond
of
athletics
should
erect
a
building
for
them
as
that
the
boys
should
clamor
for
more
room
i
do
not
wish
to
give
a
false
impression
for
we
were
often
bitterly
pressed
for
money
and
worried
by
the
prospect
of
unpaid
bills
and
we
gave
up
one
golden
scheme
after
another
because
we
could
not
afford
it
we
cooked
the
meals
and
kept
the
books
and
washed
the
windows
without
a
thought
of
hardship
if
we
thereby
saved
money
for
the
consummation
of
some
ardently
desired
undertaking
but
in
spite
of
our
financial
stringency
i
always
believed
that
money
would
be
given
when
we
had
once
clearly
reduced
the
settlement
idea
to
the
actual
deed
this
chapter
therefore
would
be
incomplete
if
it
did
not
record
a
certain
theory
of
nonresistance
or
rather
universal
good
will
which
i
had
worked
out
in
connection
with
the
settlement
idea
and
which
was
later
so
often
and
so
rudely
disturbed
at
that
time
i
had
come
to
believe
that
if
the
activities
of
were
ever
misunderstood
it
would
be
either
because
there
was
not
time
to
fully
explain
or
because
our
motives
had
become
mixed
for
i
was
convinced
that
disinterested
action
was
like
truth
or
beauty
in
its
lucidity
and
power
of
appeal
but
more
gratifying
than
any
understanding
or
response
from
without
could
possibly
be
was
the
consciousness
that
a
growing
group
of
residents
was
gathering
at
held
together
in
that
soundest
of
all
social
bonds
the
companionship
of
mutual
interests
these
residents
came
primarily
because
they
were
genuinely
interested
in
the
social
situation
and
believed
that
the
settlement
was
valuable
as
a
method
of
approach
to
it
a
house
in
which
the
men
residents
lived
was
opened
across
the
street
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
five
years
the
residential
force
numbered
fifteen
a
majority
of
whom
still
remain
identified
with
the
settlement
even
in
those
early
years
we
caught
glimpses
of
the
fact
that
certain
social
sentiments
which
are
the
difficult
and
cumulating
product
of
human
growth
and
which
like
all
higher
aims
live
only
by
communion
and
fellowship
are
cultivated
most
easily
in
the
fostering
soil
of
a
community
life
occasionally
i
obscurely
felt
as
if
a
demand
were
being
made
upon
us
for
a
ritual
which
should
express
and
carry
forward
the
hope
of
the
social
movement
i
was
constantly
bewildered
by
the
number
of
requests
i
received
to
officiate
at
funeral
services
and
by
the
curious
confessions
made
to
me
by
total
strangers
for
a
time
i
accepted
the
former
and
on
one
awful
occasion
furnished
the
poetic
part
of
a
wedding
ceremony
really
performed
by
a
justice
of
the
peace
but
i
soon
learned
to
steadfastly
refuse
such
offices
although
i
saw
that
for
many
people
without
church
affiliations
the
vague
humanitarianism
the
settlement
represented
was
the
nearest
approach
they
could
find
to
an
expression
of
their
religious
sentiments
these
hints
of
what
the
settlement
might
mean
to
at
least
a
few
spirits
among
its
contemporaries
became
clear
to
me
for
the
first
time
one
summer
day
in
rural
england
when
i
discussed
with
john
trevor
his
attempts
to
found
a
labor
church
and
his
desire
to
turn
the
toil
and
danger
attached
to
the
life
of
the
workingman
into
the
means
of
a
universal
fellowship
that
very
year
a
papyrus
leaf
brought
to
the
british
museum
from
egypt
containing
among
other
sayings
of
jesus
raise
the
stone
and
there
thou
shalt
find
me
cleave
the
wood
and
i
am
there
was
a
powerful
reminder
to
all
england
of
the
basic
relations
between
daily
labor
and
christian
teaching
in
those
early
years
at
we
were
however
in
no
danger
of
losing
ourselves
in
mazes
of
speculation
or
mysticism
and
there
was
shrewd
penetration
in
a
compliment
i
received
from
one
of
our
scotch
neighbors
he
came
down
polk
street
as
i
was
standing
near
the
foundations
of
our
new
gymnasium
and
in
response
to
his
friendly
remark
that
was
spreading
out
i
replied
that
perhaps
we
were
spreading
out
too
fast
oh
no
he
rejoined
you
can
afford
to
spread
out
wide
you
are
so
well
planted
in
the
mud
giving
the
compliment
however
a
practical
turn
as
he
glanced
at
the
deep
mire
on
the
then
unpaved
street
it
was
this
same
condition
of
polk
street
which
had
caused
the
crown
prince
of
belgium
when
he
was
brought
upon
a
visit
to
to
shake
his
head
and
meditatively
remark
there
is
not
such
a
street
no
not
one
in
all
the
territory
of
belgium
at
the
end
of
five
years
the
residents
of
published
some
first
found
facts
and
our
reflections
thereon
in
a
book
called
maps
and
papers
the
maps
were
taken
from
information
collected
by
one
of
the
residents
for
the
united
states
bureau
of
labor
in
the
investigation
into
the
slums
of
great
cities
and
the
papers
treated
of
various
neighborhood
matters
with
candor
and
genuine
concern
if
not
with
skill
the
first
edition
became
exhausted
in
two
years
and
apparently
the
boston
publisher
did
not
consider
the
book
worthy
of

problems
of
poverty
that
neglected
and
forlorn
old
age
is
daily
brought
to
the
attention
of
a
settlement
which
undertakes
to
bear
its
share
of
the
neighborhood
burden
imposed
by
poverty
was
pathetically
clear
to
us
during
our
first
months
of
residence
at
one
day
a
boy
of
ten
led
a
tottering
old
lady
into
the
house
saying
that
she
had
slept
for
six
weeks
in
their
kitchen
on
a
bed
made
up
next
to
the
stove
that
she
had
come
when
her
son
died
although
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
her
before
but
because
her
son
had
once
worked
in
the
same
shop
with
pa
she
thought
of
him
when
she
had
nowhere
to
go
the
little
fellow
concluded
by
saying
that
our
house
was
so
much
bigger
than
theirs
that
he
thought
we
would
have
more
roomfor
beds
the
old
woman
herself
said
absolutely
nothing
but
looking
on
with
that
gripping
fear
of
the
poorhouse
in
her
eyes
she
was
a
living
embodiment
of
that
dread
which
is
so
heartbreaking
that
the
occupants
of
the
county
infirmary
themselves
seem
scarcely
less
wretched
than
those
who
are
making
their
last
stand
against
it
this
look
was
almost
more
than
i
could
bear
for
only
a
few
days
before
some
frightened
women
had
bidden
me
come
quickly
to
the
house
of
an
old
german
woman
whom
two
men
from
the
country
agent
office
were
attempting
to
remove
to
the
county
infirmary
the
poor
old
creature
had
thrown
herself
bodily
upon
a
small
and
battered
chest
of
drawers
and
clung
there
clutching
it
so
firmly
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
remove
her
without
also
taking
the
piece
of
furniture
she
did
not
weep
nor
moan
nor
indeed
make
any
human
sound
but
between
her
broken
gasps
for
breath
she
squealed
shrilly
like
a
frightened
animal
caught
in
a
trap
the
little
group
of
women
and
children
gathered
at
her
door
stood
aghast
at
this
realization
of
the
black
dread
which
always
clouds
the
lives
of
the
very
poor
when
work
is
slack
but
which
constantly
grows
more
imminent
and
threatening
as
old
age
approaches
the
neighborhood
women
and
i
hastened
to
make
all
sorts
of
promises
as
to
the
support
of
the
old
woman
and
the
country
officials
only
too
glad
to
be
rid
of
their
unhappy
duty
left
her
to
our
ministrations
this
dread
of
the
poorhouse
the
result
of
centuries
of
deterrent
poor
law
administration
seemed
to
me
not
without
some
justification
one
summer
when
i
found
myself
perpetually
distressed
by
the
unnecessary
idleness
and
forlornness
of
the
old
women
in
the
cook
county
infirmary
many
of
whom
i
had
known
in
the
years
when
activity
was
still
a
necessity
and
when
they
yet
felt
bustlingly
important
to
take
away
from
an
old
woman
whose
life
has
been
spent
in
household
cares
all
the
foolish
little
belongings
to
which
her
affections
cling
and
to
which
her
very
fingers
have
become
accustomed
is
to
take
away
her
last
incentive
to
activity
almost
to
life
itself
to
give
an
old
woman
only
a
chair
and
a
bed
to
leave
her
no
cupboard
in
which
her
treasures
may
be
stowed
not
only
that
she
may
take
them
out
when
she
desires
occupation
but
that
their
mind
may
dwell
upon
them
in
moments
of
revery
is
to
reduce
living
almost
beyond
the
limit
of
human
endurance
the
poor
creature
who
clung
so
desperately
to
her
chest
of
drawers
was
really
clinging
to
the
last
remnant
of
normal
living
a
symbol
of
all
she
was
asked
to
renounce
for
several
years
after
this
summer
i
invited
five
or
six
old
women
to
take
a
two
weeks
vacation
from
the
poorhouse
which
was
eagerly
and
even
gayly
accepted
almost
all
the
old
men
in
the
county
infirmary
wander
away
each
summer
taking
their
chances
for
finding
food
or
shelter
and
return
much
refreshed
by
the
little
tramp
but
the
old
women
can
not
do
this
unless
they
have
some
help
from
the
outside
and
yet
the
expenditure
of
a
very
little
money
secures
for
them
the
coveted
vacation
i
found
that
a
few
pennies
paid
their
car
fare
into
town
a
dollar
a
week
procured
lodging
with
an
old
acquaintance
assured
of
two
good
meals
a
day
in
the
they
could
count
upon
numerous
cups
of
tea
among
old
friends
to
whom
they
would
airily
state
that
they
had
come
out
for
a
little
change
and
had
yet
made
up
their
minds
about
going
in
again
for
the
winter
they
thus
enjoyed
a
two
weeks
vacation
to
the
top
of
their
bent
and
returned
with
wondrous
tales
of
their
adventures
with
which
they
regaled
the
other
paupers
during
the
long
winter
the
reminiscences
of
these
old
women
their
shrewd
comments
upon
life
their
sense
of
having
reached
a
point
where
they
may
at
last
speak
freely
with
nothing
to
lose
because
of
their
frankness
makes
them
often
the
most
delightful
of
companions
i
recall
one
of
my
guests
the
mother
of
many
scattered
children
whose
one
bright
spot
through
all
the
dreary
years
had
been
the
wedding
feast
of
her
son
mike
a
feast
which
had
become
transformed
through
long
meditation
into
the
nectar
and
ambrosia
of
the
very
gods
as
a
farewell
fling
before
she
went
in
again
we
dined
together
upon
chicken
pie
but
it
did
not
taste
like
the
the
chicken
pie
at
mike
wedding
and
she
was
disappointed
after
all
even
death
itself
sometimes
fails
to
bring
the
dignity
and
serenity
which
one
would
fain
associate
with
old
age
i
recall
the
dying
hour
of
one
old
scotchwoman
whose
long
struggle
to
keep
respectable
had
so
embittered
her
that
her
last
words
were
gibes
and
taunts
for
those
who
were
trying
to
minister
to
her
so
you
came
in
yourself
this
morning
did
you
you
only
sent
things
yesterday
i
guess
you
knew
when
the
doctor
was
coming
do
try
to
warm
my
feet
with
anything
but
that
old
jacket
that
i
got
there
it
belonged
to
my
boy
who
was
drowned
at
sea
nigh
thirty
years
ago
but
it
warmer
yet
with
human
feelings
than
any
of
your
damned
charity
bottles
suddenly
the
harsh
gasping
voice
was
stilled
in
death
and
i
awaited
the
coming
shaken
and
horrified
the
lack
of
municipal
regulation
already
referred
to
was
in
the
early
days
of
parallelled
by
the
inadequacy
of
the
charitable
efforts
of
the
city
and
an
unfounded
optimism
that
there
was
no
real
poverty
among
us
twenty
years
ago
there
was
no
charity
organization
society
in
chicago
and
the
visiting
nurse
association
had
not
yet
begun
its
beneficial
work
while
the
relief
societies
although
conscientiously
administered
were
inadequate
in
extent
and
antiquated
in
method
as
social
reformers
gave
themselves
over
to
discussion
of
general
principles
so
the
poor
invariably
accused
poverty
itself
of
their
destruction
i
recall
a
certain
moran
who
was
returning
one
rainy
day
from
the
office
of
the
county
agent
with
her
arms
full
of
paper
bags
containing
beans
and
flour
which
alone
lay
between
her
children
and
starvation
although
she
had
no
money
she
boarded
a
street
car
in
order
to
save
her
booty
from
complete
destruction
by
the
rain
and
as
the
burst
bags
dropped
flour
on
the
dresses
and
beans
all
over
the
place
she
was
sharply
reprimanded
by
the
conductor
who
was
the
further
exasperated
when
he
discovered
she
had
no
fare
he
put
her
off
as
she
had
hoped
he
would
almost
in
front
of
she
related
to
us
her
state
of
mind
as
she
stepped
off
the
car
and
saw
the
last
of
her
wares
disappearing
she
admitted
she
forgot
the
proprieties
and
cursed
a
little
but
curiously
enough
she
pronounced
her
malediction
not
against
the
rain
nor
the
conductor
nor
yet
against
the
worthless
husband
who
had
been
set
up
to
the
city
prison
but
true
to
the
chicago
spirit
of
the
moment
went
to
the
root
of
the
matter
and
roundly
cursed
poverty
this
spirit
of
generalization
and
lack
of
organization
among
the
charitable
forces
of
the
city
was
painfully
revealed
in
that
terrible
winter
after
the
world
fair
when
the
general
financial
depression
throughout
the
country
was
much
intensified
in
chicago
by
the
numbers
of
unemployed
stranded
at
the
close
of
the
exposition
when
the
first
cold
weather
came
the
police
stations
and
the
very
corridors
of
the
city
hall
were
crowded
by
men
who
could
afford
no
other
lodging
they
made
huge
demonstrations
on
the
lake
front
reminding
one
of
the
london
gatherings
in
trafalgar
square
it
was
the
winter
in
which
stead
wrote
his
indictment
of
chicago
i
can
vividly
recall
his
visits
to
some
of
them
between
eleven
and
twelve
at
night
when
he
would
come
in
wet
and
hungry
from
an
investigation
of
the
levee
district
and
while
he
was
drinking
hot
chocolate
before
an
open
fire
would
relate
in
one
of
his
curious
monologues
his
experience
as
an
laborer
standing
in
line
without
an
overcoat
for
two
hours
in
the
sleet
that
he
might
have
a
chance
to
sweep
the
streets
or
his
adventures
with
a
crook
who
mistook
him
for
one
of
this
own
kind
and
offered
him
a
place
as
an
agent
for
a
gambling
house
which
he
promptly
accepted
stead
was
much
impressed
with
the
mixed
goodness
in
chicago
the
lack
of
rectitude
in
many
high
places
the
simple
kindness
of
the
most
wretched
to
each
other
before
he
published
if
christ
came
to
chicago
he
made
his
attempt
to
rally
the
diverse
moral
forces
of
the
city
in
a
huge
mass
meeting
which
resulted
in
a
temporary
organization
later
developing
into
the
civic
federation
i
was
a
member
of
the
committee
of
five
appointed
to
carry
out
the
suggestions
made
in
this
remarkable
meeting
and
or
first
concern
was
to
appoint
a
committee
to
deal
with
the
unemployed
but
when
has
a
committee
ever
dealt
satisfactorily
with
the
unemployed
relief
stations
were
opened
in
various
part
of
the
city
temporary
lodging
houses
were
established
undertaking
to
lodge
the
homeless
women
who
could
be
received
nowhere
else
employment
stations
were
opened
giving
sewing
to
the
women
and
street
sweeping
for
the
men
was
organized
it
was
in
connection
with
the
latter
that
the
perplexing
question
of
the
danger
of
permanently
lowering
wages
at
such
a
crisis
in
the
praiseworthy
effort
to
bring
speedy
relief
was
brought
home
to
me
i
insisted
that
it
was
better
to
have
the
men
work
half
a
day
for
cents
than
a
whole
day
for
a
dollar
better
that
they
should
earn
three
dollars
in
two
days
than
in
three
days
i
resigned
from
the
committee
in
despair
of
making
the
rest
of
the
committee
understand
that
as
our
real
object
was
not
street
cleaning
but
the
help
of
the
unemployed
we
must
treat
the
situation
in
such
wise
that
the
men
would
not
be
worse
off
when
they
returned
to
their
normal
occupations
the
discussion
opened
up
situations
new
to
me
and
carried
me
far
afield
in
perhaps
the
most
serious
economic
reading
i
have
ever
done
a
beginning
also
was
then
made
toward
a
bureau
of
organized
charities
the
main
office
being
put
in
charge
of
a
young
man
recently
come
from
boston
who
lived
at
but
to
employ
scientific
methods
for
the
first
time
at
such
a
moment
involved
difficulties
and
the
most
painful
episode
of
the
winter
came
for
me
from
an
attempt
on
my
part
to
conform
to
carefully
received
instructions
a
shipping
clerk
whom
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
had
lost
his
place
as
so
many
people
had
that
year
and
came
to
the
relief
station
established
at
four
or
five
times
to
secure
help
for
his
family
i
told
him
one
day
of
the
opportunity
for
work
on
the
drainage
canal
and
intimated
that
if
any
employment
were
obtainable
he
ought
to
exhaust
that
possibility
before
asking
for
help
the
man
replied
that
he
had
always
worked
indoors
and
that
he
could
not
endure
outside
work
in
winter
i
am
grateful
to
remember
that
i
was
too
uncertain
to
be
severe
although
i
held
to
my
instructions
he
did
not
come
again
for
relief
but
worked
for
two
days
digging
on
the
canal
where
he
contracted
pneumonia
and
died
a
week
later
i
have
never
lost
trace
of
the
two
little
children
he
left
behind
him
although
i
can
not
see
them
without
a
bitter
consciousness
that
it
was
at
their
expense
i
learned
that
life
can
not
be
administered
by
definite
rules
and
regulations
that
wisdom
to
deal
with
a
man
difficulties
comes
only
through
some
knowledge
of
his
life
and
habits
as
a
whole
and
that
to
treat
an
isolated
episode
is
almost
sure
to
invite
blundering
it
was
also
during
this
winter
that
i
became
permanently
impressed
with
the
kindness
of
the
poor
to
each
other
the
woman
who
lives
upstairs
will
willingly
share
her
breakfast
with
the
family
below
because
she
knows
they
are
hard
up
the
man
who
boarded
with
them
last
winter
will
give
a
month
rent
because
he
knows
the
father
of
the
family
is
out
of
work
the
baker
across
the
street
who
is
fast
being
pushed
to
the
wall
by
his
downtown
competitors
will
send
across
three
loaves
of
stale
bread
because
he
has
seen
the
children
looking
longingly
into
his
window
and
suspects
they
are
hungry
there
are
also
the
families
who
during
times
of
business
depression
are
obliged
to
seek
help
from
the
county
or
some
benevolent
society
but
who
are
themselves
most
anxious
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
pauper
class
with
whom
indeed
they
do
not
in
the
least
belong
charles
booth
in
his
brilliant
chapter
on
the
unemployed
expresses
regret
that
the
problems
of
the
working
class
are
so
often
confounded
with
the
problems
of
the
inefficient
and
the
idle
that
although
working
people
live
in
the
same
street
with
those
in
need
of
charity
to
thus
confound
two
problems
is
to
render
the
solution
of
both
impossible
i
remember
one
family
in
which
the
father
had
been
out
of
work
for
this
same
winter
most
of
the
furniture
had
been
pawned
and
as
the
shoes
could
not
be
replaced
the
children
could
not
go
to
school
the
mother
was
ill
and
barely
able
to
come
for
the
supplies
and
medicines
two
years
later
she
invited
me
to
supper
one
sunday
evening
in
the
little
home
which
had
been
completely
restored
and
she
gave
as
a
reason
for
the
invitation
that
she
could
bear
to
have
me
remember
them
as
they
had
been
during
that
one
winter
which
she
insisted
had
been
unique
in
her
twelve
years
of
married
life
she
said
that
it
was
as
if
she
had
met
me
not
as
i
am
ordinarily
but
as
i
should
appear
misshapen
with
rheumatism
or
with
a
face
distorted
by
neuralgic
pain
that
it
was
not
fair
to
judge
poor
people
that
way
she
perhaps
unconsciously
illustrated
the
difference
between
the
relation
to
the
poor
and
the
settlement
relation
to
its
neighbors
the
latter
wishing
to
know
them
through
all
the
varying
conditions
of
life
to
stand
by
when
they
are
in
distress
but
by
no
means
to
drop
intercourse
with
them
when
normal
prosperity
has
returned
enabling
the
relation
to
become
more
social
and
free
from
economic
disturbance
possibly
something
of
the
same
effort
has
to
be
made
within
the
settlement
itself
to
keep
its
own
sense
of
proportion
in
regard
to
the
relation
of
the
crowded
city
quarter
to
the
rest
of
the
country
it
was
in
the
spring
following
this
terrible
winter
during
a
journey
to
meet
lecture
engagements
in
california
that
i
found
myself
amazed
at
the
large
stretches
of
open
country
and
prosperous
towns
through
which
we
passed
day
by
day
whose
existence
i
had
quite
forgotten
in
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
of
i
served
as
a
member
on
a
commission
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
chicago
to
investigate
conditions
in
the
county
poorhouse
public
attention
having
become
centered
on
it
through
one
of
those
distressing
stories
which
exaggerates
the
wrong
in
a
public
institution
while
at
the
same
time
it
reveals
conditions
which
need
to
be
rectified
however
necessary
publicity
is
for
securing
reformed
administration
however
useful
such
exposures
may
be
for
political
purposes
the
whole
is
attended
by
such
a
waste
of
the
most
precious
human
emotions
by
such
a
tearing
of
living
tissue
that
it
can
scarcely
be
endured
every
time
i
entered
during
the
days
of
the
investigation
i
would
find
waiting
for
me
from
twenty
to
thirty
people
whose
friends
and
relatives
were
in
the
suspected
institution
all
in
such
acute
distress
of
mind
that
to
see
them
was
to
look
upon
the
victims
of
deliberate
torture
in
most
cases
my
visitor
would
state
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
put
their
invalids
in
any
other
place
but
if
these
stories
were
true
something
must
be
done
many
of
the
patients
were
taken
out
only
to
be
returned
after
a
few
days
or
weeks
to
meet
the
sullen
hostility
of
their
attendants
and
with
their
own
attitude
changed
from
confidence
to
timidity
and
alarm
this
piteous
dependence
of
the
poor
upon
the
good
will
of
public
officials
was
made
clear
to
us
in
an
early
experience
with
a
peasant
woman
straight
from
the
fields
of
germany
whom
we
met
during
our
first
six
months
at
her
four
years
in
america
had
been
spent
in
patiently
carrying
water
up
and
down
two
flights
of
stairs
and
in
washing
the
heavy
flannel
suits
of
iron
foundry
workers
for
this
her
pay
had
averaged
cents
a
day
three
of
her
daughters
had
fallen
victims
to
the
vice
of
the
city
the
mother
was
bewildered
and
distressed
but
understood
nothing
we
were
able
to
induce
the
betrayer
of
one
daughter
to
marry
her
the
second
after
a
tedious
lawsuit
supported
his
child
with
the
third
we
were
able
to
do
nothing
this
woman
is
now
living
with
her
family
in
a
little
house
seventeen
miles
from
the
city
she
has
made
two
payments
on
her
land
and
is
a
lesson
to
all
beholders
as
she
pastures
her
cow
up
and
down
the
railroad
tracks
and
makes
money
from
her
ten
acres
she
did
not
need
charity
for
she
had
an
immense
capacity
for
hard
work
but
she
sadly
needed
the
service
of
the
state
attorney
office
enforcing
the
laws
designed
for
the
protection
of
such
girls
as
her
daughters
we
early
found
ourselves
spending
many
hours
in
efforts
to
secure
support
for
deserted
women
insurance
for
bewildered
widows
damages
for
injured
operators
furniture
from
the
clutches
of
the
installment
store
the
settlement
is
valuable
as
an
information
and
interpretation
bureau
it
constantly
acts
between
the
various
institutions
of
the
city
and
the
people
for
whose
benefit
these
institutions
were
erected
the
hospitals
the
county
agencies
and
state
asylums
are
often
but
vague
rumors
to
the
people
who
need
them
most
another
function
of
the
settlement
to
its
neighborhood
resembles
that
of
the
big
brother
whose
mere
presence
on
the
playground
protects
the
little
one
from
bullies
we
early
learned
to
know
the
children
of
mothers
who
went
out
to
work
all
day
sometimes
leaving
the
little
things
in
the
casual
care
of
a
neighbor
but
often
locking
them
into
their
tenement
rooms
the
first
three
crippled
children
we
encountered
in
the
neighborhood
had
all
been
injured
while
their
mothers
were
at
work
one
had
fallen
out
of
a
window
another
had
been
burned
and
the
third
had
a
curved
spine
due
to
the
fact
that
for
three
years
he
had
been
tied
all
day
long
to
the
leg
of
the
kitchen
table
only
released
at
noon
by
his
older
brother
who
hastily
ran
in
from
a
neighboring
factory
to
share
his
lunch
with
him
when
the
hot
weather
came
the
restless
children
could
not
brook
the
confinement
of
the
stuffy
rooms
and
as
it
was
not
considered
safe
to
leave
the
doors
open
because
of
sneak
thieves
many
of
the
children
were
locked
out
during
our
first
summer
an
increasing
number
of
these
poor
little
mites
would
wander
into
the
cool
hallway
of
we
kept
them
there
and
fed
them
at
noon
in
return
for
which
we
were
sometimes
offered
a
hot
penny
which
had
been
held
in
a
tight
little
fist
ever
since
mother
left
this
morning
to
buy
something
to
eat
with
out
of
kindergarten
hours
our
little
guests
noisily
enjoyed
the
hospitality
of
our
bedrooms
under
the
care
of
any
resident
who
volunteered
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
but
later
they
were
moved
into
a
neighboring
apartment
under
more
systematic
supervision
was
thus
committed
to
a
day
nursery
which
we
sustained
for
sixteen
years
first
in
a
little
cottage
on
a
side
street
and
then
in
a
building
designed
for
its
use
called
the
house
it
is
now
carried
on
by
the
united
charities
of
chicago
in
a
finely
equipped
building
on
our
block
where
the
immigrant
mothers
are
cared
for
as
well
as
the
children
and
where
they
are
taught
the
things
which
will
make
life
in
america
more
possible
our
early
day
nursery
brought
us
into
natural
relations
with
the
poorest
women
of
the
neighborhood
many
of
whom
were
bearing
the
burden
of
dissolute
and
incompetent
husbands
in
addition
to
the
support
of
their
children
some
of
them
presented
an
impressive
manifestation
of
that
miracle
of
affection
which
outlives
abuse
neglect
and
crime
the
affection
which
can
not
be
plucked
from
the
heart
where
it
has
lived
although
it
may
serve
only
to
torture
and
torment
has
your
husband
come
back
you
inquire
of
whom
you
have
known
for
eight
years
as
an
overworked
woman
bringing
her
three
delicate
children
every
morning
to
the
nursery
she
is
bent
under
the
double
burden
of
earning
the
money
which
supports
them
and
giving
them
the
tender
care
which
alone
keeps
them
alive
the
oldest
two
children
have
at
last
gone
to
work
and
has
allowed
herself
the
luxury
of
staying
at
home
two
days
a
week
and
now
the
worthless
husband
is
back
again
the
gentlemanly
gambler
type
who
through
all
vicissitudes
manages
to
present
a
white
shirtfront
and
a
gold
watch
to
the
world
but
who
is
dissolute
idle
and
extravagant
you
dread
to
think
how
much
his
presence
will
increase
the
drain
upon
the
family
exchequer
and
you
know
that
he
stayed
away
until
he
was
certain
that
the
children
were
old
enough
to
earn
money
for
his
luxuries
does
not
pretend
to
take
his
return
lightly
but
she
replies
in
all
seriousness
and
simplicity
you
know
my
feeling
for
him
has
never
changed
you
may
think
me
foolish
but
i
was
always
proud
of
his
good
looks
and
educated
appearance
i
was
lonely
and
homesick
during
those
eight
years
when
the
children
were
little
and
needed
so
much
doctoring
but
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
feel
hard
toward
him
and
i
used
to
pray
the
good
lord
to
keep
him
from
harm
and
bring
him
back
to
us
so
of
course
i
thankful
now
she
passes
on
with
a
dignity
which
gives
one
a
new
sense
of
the
security
of
affection
i
recall
a
similar
case
of
a
woman
who
had
supported
her
three
children
for
five
years
during
which
time
her
dissolute
husband
constantly
demanded
money
for
drink
and
kept
her
perpetually
worried
and
intimidated
one
saturday
before
the
blessed
easter
he
came
back
from
a
long
debauch
ragged
and
filthy
but
in
a
state
of
lachrymose
repentance
the
poor
wife
received
him
as
a
returned
prodigal
believed
that
his
remorse
would
prove
lasting
and
felt
sure
that
if
she
and
the
children
went
to
church
with
him
on
easter
sunday
and
he
could
be
induced
to
take
the
pledge
before
the
priest
all
their
troubles
would
be
ended
after
hours
of
vigorous
effort
and
the
expenditure
of
all
her
savings
he
finally
sat
on
the
front
doorstep
the
morning
of
easter
sunday
bathed
shaved
and
arrayed
in
a
fine
new
suit
of
clothes
she
left
him
sitting
there
in
the
reluctant
spring
sunshine
while
she
finished
washing
and
dressing
the
children
when
she
finally
opened
the
front
door
with
the
three
shining
children
that
they
might
all
set
forth
together
the
returned
prodigal
had
disappeared
and
was
not
seen
again
until
midnight
when
he
came
back
in
a
glorious
state
of
intoxication
from
the
proceeds
of
his
pawned
clothes
and
clad
once
more
in
the
dingiest
attire
she
took
him
in
without
comment
only
to
begin
again
the
wretched
cycle
there
were
of
course
instances
of
the
criminal
husband
as
well
as
of
the
merely
vicious
i
recall
one
woman
who
during
seven
years
never
missed
a
visiting
day
at
the
penitentiary
when
she
might
see
her
husband
and
whose
little
children
in
the
nursery
proudly
reported
the
messages
from
father
with
no
notion
that
he
was
in
disgrace
so
absolutely
did
they
reflect
the
gallant
spirit
of
their
mother
while
one
was
filled
with
admiration
for
these
heroic
women
something
was
also
to
be
said
for
some
of
the
husbands
for
the
sorry
men
who
for
one
reason
or
another
had
failed
in
the
struggle
of
life
sometimes
this
failure
was
purely
economic
and
the
men
were
competent
to
give
the
children
whom
they
were
not
able
to
support
the
care
and
guidance
and
even
education
which
were
of
the
highest
value
only
a
few
months
ago
i
met
upon
the
street
one
of
the
early
nursery
mothers
who
for
five
years
had
been
living
in
another
part
of
the
city
and
in
response
to
my
query
as
to
the
welfare
of
her
five
children
she
bitterly
replied
all
of
them
except
mary
have
been
arrested
at
one
time
or
another
thank
you
in
reply
to
my
remark
that
i
thought
her
husband
had
always
had
such
admirable
control
over
them
she
burst
out
that
has
been
the
whole
trouble
i
got
tired
taking
care
of
him
and
did
believe
that
his
laziness
was
all
due
to
his
health
as
he
said
so
i
left
him
and
said
that
i
would
support
the
children
but
not
him
from
that
minute
the
trouble
with
the
four
boys
began
i
never
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
after
every
sort
of
a
scrape
i
finally
put
jack
and
the
twins
into
institutions
where
i
pay
for
them
joe
has
gone
to
work
at
last
but
with
a
disgraceful
record
behind
him
i
tell
you
i
ai
so
sure
that
because
a
woman
can
make
big
money
that
she
can
be
both
father
and
mother
to
her
children
as
i
walked
on
i
could
but
wonder
in
which
particular
we
are
most
stupid
to
judge
a
man
worth
so
solely
by
his
capacity
that
a
good
wife
feels
justified
in
leaving
him
or
in
holding
fast
to
that
wretched
delusion
that
a
woman
can
both
support
and
nurture
her
children
one
of
the
most
piteous
revelations
of
the
futility
of
the
latter
attempt
came
to
me
through
the
mother
of
goosie
as
the
children
for
years
called
a
little
boy
who
because
he
was
brought
to
the
nursery
wrapped
up
in
his
mother
shawl
always
had
his
hair
filled
with
the
down
and
small
feathers
from
the
feather
brush
factory
where
she
worked
one
march
morning
goosie
mother
was
hanging
out
the
washing
on
a
shed
roof
before
she
left
for
the
factory
goosie
was
trotting
at
her
heels
handing
her
clothes
pins
when
he
was
suddenly
blown
off
the
roof
by
the
high
wind
into
the
alley
below
his
neck
was
broken
by
the
fall
and
as
he
lay
piteous
and
limp
on
a
pile
of
frozen
refuse
his
mother
cheerily
called
him
to
climb
up
again
so
confident
do
overworked
mothers
become
that
their
children
can
not
get
hurt
after
the
funeral
as
the
poor
mother
sat
in
the
nursery
postponing
the
moment
when
she
must
go
back
to
her
empty
rooms
i
asked
her
in
a
futile
effort
to
be
of
comfort
if
there
was
anything
more
we
could
do
for
her
the
overworked
woman
looked
up
and
replied
if
you
could
give
me
my
wages
for
i
would
not
go
to
work
in
the
factory
at
all
i
would
like
to
stay
at
home
all
day
and
hold
the
baby
goosie
was
always
asking
me
to
take
him
and
i
never
had
any
time
this
statement
revealed
the
condition
of
many
nursery
mothers
who
are
obliged
to
forego
the
joys
and
solaces
which
belong
to
even
the
most
the
long
hours
of
factory
labor
necessary
for
earning
the
support
of
a
child
leave
no
time
for
the
tender
care
and
caressing
which
may
enrich
the
life
of
the
most
piteous
baby
with
all
of
the
efforts
made
by
modern
society
to
nurture
and
educate
the
young
how
stupid
it
is
to
permit
the
mothers
of
young
children
to
spend
themselves
in
the
coarser
work
of
the
world
it
is
curiously
inconsistent
that
with
the
emphasis
which
this
generation
has
placed
upon
the
mother
and
upon
the
prolongation
of
infancy
we
constantly
allow
the
waste
of
this
most
precious
material
i
can
not
recall
without
indignation
a
recent
experience
i
was
detained
late
one
evening
in
an
office
building
by
a
prolonged
committee
meeting
of
the
board
of
education
as
i
came
out
at
eleven
i
met
in
the
corridor
of
the
fourteenth
floor
a
woman
whom
i
knew
on
her
knees
scrubbing
the
marble
tiling
as
she
straightened
up
to
greet
me
she
seemed
so
wet
from
her
feet
up
to
her
chin
that
i
hastily
inquired
the
cause
her
reply
was
that
she
left
home
at
five
every
night
and
had
no
opportunity
for
six
hours
to
nurse
her
baby
her
mother
milk
mingled
with
the
very
water
with
which
she
scrubbed
the
floors
until
she
should
return
at
midnight
heated
and
exhausted
to
feed
her
screaming
child
with
what
remained
within
her
breasts
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
problems
connected
with
the
lives
of
the
poorest
people
with
whom
the
residents
in
a
settlement
are
constantly
brought
in
contact
i
can
not
close
this
chapter
without
a
reference
to
that
gallant
company
of
men
and
women
among
whom
my
acquaintance
is
so
large
who
are
fairly
indifferent
to
starvation
itself
because
of
their
preoccupation
with
higher
ends
among
them
are
visionaries
and
enthusiasts
unsuccessful
artists
writers
and
reformers
for
many
years
at
we
knew
a
german
woman
who
was
completely
absorbed
in
the
experiment
of
expressing
musical
phrases
and
melodies
by
means
of
colors
because
she
was
small
and
deformed
she
stowed
herself
into
her
trunk
every
night
where
she
slept
on
a
canvas
stretched
from
the
four
corners
and
her
food
was
of
the
meagerest
nevertheless
if
a
visitor
left
an
offering
upon
her
table
it
was
largely
spent
for
apparatus
or
delicately
colored
silk
floss
with
which
to
pursue
the
fascinating
experiment
another
sadly
crippled
old
woman
the
widow
of
a
sea
captain
although
living
almost
exclusively
upon
malted
milk
tablets
as
affording
a
cheap
form
of
prepared
food
was
always
eager
to
talk
of
the
beautiful
illuminated
manuscripts
she
had
sought
out
in
her
travels
and
to
show
specimens
of
her
own
work
as
an
illuminator
still
another
of
these
impressive
old
women
was
an
inveterate
inventor
although
she
had
seen
prosperous
days
in
england
when
we
knew
her
she
subsisted
largely
upon
the
samples
given
away
at
the
demonstration
counters
of
the
department
stores
and
on
bits
of
food
which
she
cooked
on
a
coal
shovel
in
the
furnace
of
the
apartment
house
whose
basement
back
room
she
occupied
although
her
inventions
were
not
practicable
various
experts
to
whom
they
were
submitted
always
pronounced
them
suggestive
and
ingenious
i
once
saw
her
receive
this
complimentary
verdict
this
ribbon
to
stick
in
her
coat
with
such
dignity
and
gravity
that
the
words
of
condolence
for
her
financial
disappointment
died
upon
my
lips
these
indomitable
souls
are
but
three
out
of
many
whom
i
might
instance
to
prove
that
those
who
are
handicapped
in
the
race
for
life
goods
sometimes
play
a
magnificent
trick
upon
the
jade
life
herself
by
ceasing
to
know
whether
or
not
they
possess
any
of
her
tawdry
goods

chapter
ix
a
decade
of
economic
discussion
the
residents
were
often
bewildered
by
the
desire
for
constant
discussion
which
characterized
chicago
twenty
years
ago
for
although
the
residents
in
the
early
settlements
were
in
many
cases
young
persons
who
had
sought
relief
from
the
consciousness
of
social
maladjustment
in
the
anodyne
of
work
afforded
by
philanthropic
and
civic
activities
their
former
experiences
had
not
thrown
them
into
company
with
radicals
the
decade
between
was
in
chicago
a
period
of
propaganda
as
over
against
constructive
social
effort
the
moment
for
marching
and
carrying
banners
for
stating
general
principles
and
making
a
demonstration
rather
than
the
time
for
uncovering
the
situation
and
for
providing
the
legal
measures
and
the
civic
organization
through
which
new
social
hopes
might
make
themselves
felt
when
was
established
in
the
events
of
the
haymarket
riot
were
already
two
years
old
but
during
that
time
chicago
had
apparently
gone
through
the
first
period
of
repressive
measures
and
in
the
winter
of
by
the
advice
and
with
the
active
participation
of
its
leading
citizens
the
city
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
only
cure
for
the
acts
of
anarchy
was
free
speech
and
an
open
discussion
of
the
ills
of
which
the
opponents
of
government
complained
great
open
meetings
were
held
every
sunday
evening
in
the
recital
hall
of
the
then
new
auditorium
presided
over
by
such
representative
citizens
as
lyman
gage
and
every
possible
shade
of
opinion
was
freely
expressed
a
man
who
spoke
constantly
at
these
meetings
used
to
be
pointed
out
to
the
visiting
stranger
as
one
who
had
been
involved
with
the
group
of
convicted
anarchists
and
who
doubtless
would
have
been
arrested
and
tried
but
for
the
accident
of
his
having
been
in
milwaukee
when
the
explosion
occurred
one
can
not
imagine
such
meetings
being
held
in
chicago
nor
that
such
a
man
should
be
encouraged
to
raise
his
voice
in
a
public
assemblage
presided
over
by
a
leading
banker
it
is
hard
to
tell
just
what
change
has
come
over
our
philosophy
or
over
the
minds
of
those
citizens
who
were
then
convinced
that
if
these
conferences
had
been
established
earlier
the
haymarket
riot
and
all
its
sensational
results
might
have
been
avoided
at
any
rate
there
seemed
a
further
need
for
smaller
clubs
where
men
who
differed
widely
in
their
social
theories
might
meet
for
discussion
where
representatives
of
the
various
economic
schools
might
modify
each
other
and
at
least
learn
tolerance
and
the
futility
of
endeavoring
to
convince
all
the
world
of
the
truth
of
one
position
fanaticism
is
engendered
only
when
men
finding
no
contradiction
to
their
theories
at
last
believe
that
the
very
universe
lends
itself
as
an
exemplification
of
one
point
of
view
the
working
people
social
science
club
was
organized
at
in
the
spring
of
by
an
english
workingman
and
for
seven
years
it
held
a
weekly
meeting
at
eight
every
wednesday
night
the
secretary
called
to
order
from
forty
to
one
hundred
people
a
chairman
for
the
evening
was
elected
a
speaker
was
introduced
who
was
allowed
to
talk
until
nine
his
subject
was
then
thrown
open
to
discussion
and
a
lively
debate
ensued
until
ten
at
which
hour
the
meeting
was
declared
adjourned
the
enthusiasm
of
this
club
seldom
lagged
its
zest
for
discussion
was
unceasing
and
any
attempt
to
turn
it
into
a
study
or
reading
club
always
met
with
the
strong
disapprobation
of
the
members
in
these
weekly
discussions
in
the
drawing
room
everything
was
thrown
back
upon
general
principles
and
all
discussion
save
that
which
went
to
the
root
of
things
was
impatiently
discarded
as
an
unworthy
halfway
measure
i
recall
one
evening
in
this
club
when
an
exasperated
member
had
thrown
out
the
statement
that
believes
that
socialism
will
cure
the
toothache
promptly
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
that
it
certainly
would
that
when
every
child
teeth
were
systematically
cared
for
from
the
beginning
toothaches
would
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
belonging
as
it
did
to
the
extinct
competitive
order
as
the
black
plague
had
disappeared
from
the
earth
with
the
feudal
regime
of
the
middle
ages
but
he
added
why
do
we
spend
time
discussing
trifles
like
the
toothache
when
great
social
changes
are
to
be
considered
which
will
of
themselves
reform
these
minor
ills
even
the
man
who
had
been
humorous
fell
into
the
solemn
tone
of
the
gathering
it
was
perhaps
here
that
the
socialist
surpassed
everyone
else
in
the
fervor
of
economic
discussion
he
was
usually
a
german
or
a
russian
with
a
turn
for
logical
presentation
who
saw
in
the
concentration
of
capital
and
the
growth
of
monopolies
an
inevitable
transition
to
the
socialist
state
he
pointed
out
that
the
concentration
of
capital
in
fewer
hands
but
increased
the
mass
of
those
whose
interests
were
opposed
to
a
maintenance
of
its
power
and
vastly
simplified
its
final
absorption
by
the
community
that
monopoly
when
it
is
finished
doth
bring
forth
socialism
opposite
to
him
springing
up
in
every
discussion
was
the
individualist
or
as
the
socialist
called
him
the
anarchist
who
insisted
that
we
shall
never
secure
just
human
relations
until
we
have
equality
of
opportunity
that
the
sole
function
of
the
state
is
to
maintain
the
freedom
of
each
guarded
by
the
like
freedom
of
all
in
order
that
each
man
may
be
able
to
work
out
the
problems
of
his
own
existence
that
first
winter
was
within
three
years
of
the
henry
george
campaign
in
new
york
when
his
adherents
all
over
the
country
were
carrying
on
a
successful
and
effective
propaganda
when
henry
george
himself
came
to
one
sunday
afternoon
the
gymnasium
which
was
already
crowded
with
men
to
hear
father
huntington
address
on
why
should
a
free
thinker
believe
in
christ
fairly
rocked
on
its
foundations
under
the
enthusiastic
and
prolonged
applause
which
greeted
this
great
leader
and
constantly
interrupted
his
stirring
address
filled
as
all
of
his
speeches
were
with
high
moral
enthusiasm
and
humanitarian
fervor
of
the
remarkable
congresses
held
in
connection
with
the
world
fair
perhaps
those
inaugurated
by
the
advocates
of
single
tax
exceeded
all
others
in
vital
enthusiasm
it
was
possibly
significant
that
all
discussions
in
the
department
of
social
science
had
to
be
organized
by
partisans
in
separate
groups
the
very
committee
itself
on
social
science
composed
of
chicago
citizens
of
whom
i
was
one
changed
from
week
to
week
as
partisan
members
had
their
feelings
hurt
because
their
cause
did
not
receive
due
recognition
and
yet
in
the
same
building
adherents
of
the
most
diverse
religious
creeds
eastern
and
western
met
in
amity
and
good
fellowship
did
it
perhaps
indicate
that
their
presentation
of
the
eternal
problems
of
life
were
cast
in
an
older
and
less
sensitive
mold
than
this
presentation
in
terms
of
social
experience
or
was
it
rather
that
the
new
social
science
was
not
yet
a
science
at
all
but
merely
a
name
under
cover
of
which
we
might
discuss
the
perplexing
problems
of
the
industrial
situation
certainly
the
difficulties
of
our
committee
were
not
minimized
by
the
fact
that
the
then
new
science
of
sociology
had
not
yet
defined
its
own
field
the
university
of
chicago
opened
only
the
year
before
the
fair
was
the
first
great
institution
of
learning
to
institute
a
department
of
sociology
in
the
meantime
the
social
science
club
grew
in
numbers
and
fervor
as
various
distinguished
people
who
were
visiting
the
world
fair
came
to
address
it
i
recall
a
brilliant
frenchwoman
who
was
filled
with
amazement
because
one
of
the
shabbiest
men
reflected
a
reading
of
schopenhauer
she
considered
the
statement
of
another
member
most
remarkable
that
when
he
saw
a
carriage
driving
through
the
streets
occupied
by
a
capitalist
who
was
no
longer
even
an
entrepreneur
he
felt
quite
as
sure
that
his
days
were
numbered
and
that
his
very
lack
of
function
to
society
would
speedily
bring
him
to
extinction
as
he
did
when
he
saw
a
drunkard
reeling
along
the
same
street
the
club
at
any
rate
convinced
the
residents
that
no
one
so
poignantly
realizes
the
failures
in
the
social
structure
as
the
man
at
the
bottom
who
has
been
most
directly
in
contact
with
those
failures
and
has
suffered
most
i
recall
the
shrewd
comments
of
a
certain
sailor
who
had
known
the
disinherited
in
every
country
of
a
russian
who
had
served
his
term
in
siberia
of
an
old
irishman
who
called
himself
an
atheist
but
who
in
moments
of
excitement
always
blamed
the
good
lord
for
setting
supinely
when
the
world
was
so
horribly
out
of
joint
it
was
doubtless
owing
largely
to
this
club
that
contracted
its
early
reputation
for
radicalism
visitors
refused
to
distinguish
between
the
sentiments
expressed
by
its
members
in
the
heat
of
discussion
and
the
opinions
held
by
the
residents
themselves
at
that
moment
in
chicago
the
radical
of
every
shade
of
opinion
was
vigorous
and
dogmatic
of
the
sort
that
could
not
resign
himself
to
the
slow
march
of
human
improvement
of
the
type
who
knew
exactly
in
what
part
of
the
world
utopia
standeth
during
this
decade
chicago
seemed
divided
into
two
classes
those
who
held
that
business
is
business
and
who
were
therefore
annoyed
at
the
very
notion
of
social
control
and
the
radicals
who
claimed
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
really
moralize
the
industrial
situation
until
society
should
be
reorganized
a
settlement
is
above
all
a
place
for
enthusiasms
a
spot
to
which
those
who
have
a
passion
for
the
equalization
of
human
joys
and
opportunities
are
early
attracted
it
is
this
type
of
mind
which
is
in
itself
so
often
obnoxious
to
the
man
of
conquering
business
faculty
to
whom
the
practical
world
of
affairs
seems
so
supremely
rational
that
he
would
never
vote
to
change
the
type
of
it
even
if
he
could
the
man
of
social
enthusiasm
is
to
him
an
annoyance
and
an
affront
he
does
not
like
to
hear
him
talk
and
considers
him
per
se
unsafe
such
a
business
man
would
admit
as
an
abstract
proposition
that
society
is
susceptible
of
modification
and
would
even
agree
that
all
human
institutions
imply
progressive
development
but
at
the
same
time
he
deeply
distrusts
those
who
seek
to
reform
existing
conditions
there
is
a
certain
foundation
for
this
distrust
for
too
often
the
reformer
is
the
rebel
who
defies
things
as
they
are
because
of
the
restraints
which
they
impose
upon
his
individual
desires
rather
than
because
of
the
general
defects
of
the
system
when
such
a
rebel
poses
for
a
reformer
his
shortcomings
are
heralded
to
the
world
and
his
downfall
is
cherished
as
an
awful
warning
to
those
who
refuse
to
worship
the
god
of
things
as
they
are
and
yet
as
i
recall
the
members
of
this
early
club
even
those
who
talked
the
most
and
the
least
rationally
seem
to
me
to
have
been
particularly
kindly
and
safe
the
most
pronounced
anarchist
among
them
has
long
since
become
a
convert
to
a
religious
sect
holding
buddhistic
tenets
which
imply
little
food
and
a
distrust
of
all
action
he
has
become
a
wraith
of
his
former
self
but
he
still
retains
his
kindly
smile
in
the
discussion
of
these
themes
was
of
course
quite
as
much
under
the
suspicion
of
one
side
as
the
other
i
remember
one
night
when
i
addressed
a
club
of
secularists
which
met
at
the
corner
of
south
halsted
and
madison
streets
a
man
called
out
you
are
all
right
now
but
mark
my
words
when
you
are
subsidized
by
the
millionaires
you
will
be
afraid
to
talk
like
this
the
defense
of
free
speech
was
a
sensitive
point
with
me
and
i
quickly
replied
that
while
i
did
not
intend
to
be
subsidized
by
millionaires
neither
did
i
propose
to
be
bullied
by
workingmen
and
that
i
should
state
my
honest
opinion
without
consulting
either
of
them
to
my
surprise
the
audience
of
radicals
broke
into
applause
and
the
discussion
turned
upon
the
need
of
resisting
tyranny
wherever
found
if
democratic
institutions
were
to
endure
this
desire
to
bear
independent
witness
to
social
righteousness
often
resulted
in
a
sense
of
compromise
difficult
to
endure
and
at
many
times
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
destined
to
alienate
everybody
i
should
have
been
most
grateful
at
that
time
to
accept
the
tenets
of
socialism
and
i
conscientiously
made
my
effort
both
by
reading
and
by
many
discussions
with
the
comrades
i
found
that
i
could
easily
give
an
affirmative
answer
to
the
heated
question
do
you
see
that
just
as
the
hand
mill
created
a
society
with
a
feudal
lord
so
the
steam
mill
creates
a
society
with
an
industrial
capitalist
but
it
was
a
little
harder
to
give
an
affirmative
reply
to
the
proposition
that
the
social
relation
thus
established
proceeds
to
create
principles
ideas
and
categories
as
merely
historical
and
transitory
products
of
course
i
use
the
term
socialism
technically
and
do
not
wish
to
confuse
it
with
the
growing
sensitiveness
which
recognizes
that
no
personal
comfort
nor
individual
development
can
compensate
a
man
for
the
misery
of
his
neighbors
nor
with
the
increasing
conviction
that
social
arrangements
can
be
transformed
through
man
conscious
and
deliberate
effort
such
a
definition
would
not
have
been
accepted
for
a
moment
by
the
russians
who
then
dominated
the
socialist
party
in
chicago
and
among
whom
a
crude
interpretation
of
the
class
conflict
was
the
test
of
faith
during
those
first
years
on
halsted
street
nothing
was
more
painfully
clear
than
the
fact
that
pliable
human
nature
is
relentlessly
pressed
upon
by
its
physical
environment
i
saw
nowhere
a
more
devoted
effort
to
understand
and
relieve
that
heavy
pressure
than
the
socialists
were
making
and
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
had
the
comradeship
of
that
gallant
company
had
they
not
firmly
insisted
that
fellowship
depends
upon
identity
of
creed
they
repudiated
similarity
of
aim
and
social
sympathy
as
tests
which
were
much
too
loose
and
wavering
as
they
did
that
vague
socialism
which
for
thousands
has
come
to
be
a
philosophy
or
rather
religion
embodying
the
hope
of
the
world
and
the
protection
of
all
who
suffer
i
also
longed
for
the
comfort
of
a
definite
social
creed
which
should
afford
at
one
and
the
same
time
an
explanation
of
the
social
chaos
and
the
logical
steps
towards
its
better
ordering
i
came
to
have
an
exaggerated
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
poverty
in
the
midst
of
which
i
was
living
and
which
the
socialists
constantly
forced
me
to
defend
my
plight
was
not
unlike
that
which
might
have
resulted
in
my
old
days
of
skepticism
regarding
foreordination
had
i
then
been
compelled
to
defend
the
confusion
arising
from
the
clashing
of
free
wills
as
an
alternative
to
an
acceptance
of
the
doctrine
another
difficulty
in
the
way
of
accepting
this
economic
determinism
so
baldly
dependent
upon
the
theory
of
class
consciousness
constantly
arose
when
i
lectured
in
country
towns
and
there
had
opportunities
to
read
human
documents
of
prosperous
people
as
well
as
those
of
my
neighbors
who
were
crowded
into
the
city
the
former
were
stoutly
unconscious
of
any
classes
in
america
and
the
class
consciousness
of
the
immigrants
was
fast
being
broken
into
by
the
necessity
for
making
new
and
unprecedented
connections
in
the
industrial
life
all
about
them
in
the
meantime
although
many
men
of
many
minds
met
constantly
at
our
conferences
it
was
amazing
to
find
the
incorrigible
good
nature
which
prevailed
radicals
are
accustomed
to
hot
discussion
and
sharp
differences
of
opinion
and
take
it
all
in
the
day
work
i
recall
that
the
secretary
of
the
social
science
club
at
the
anniversary
of
the
seventh
year
of
its
existence
read
a
report
in
which
he
stated
that
so
far
as
he
could
remember
but
twice
during
that
time
had
a
speaker
lost
his
temper
and
in
each
case
it
had
been
a
college
professor
who
was
accustomed
to
being
talked
back
to
he
also
added
that
but
once
had
all
the
club
members
united
in
applauding
the
same
speaker
only
samuel
jones
who
afterwards
became
the
golden
rule
mayor
of
toledo
had
been
able
to
overcome
all
their
dogmatic
differences
when
he
had
set
forth
a
plan
of
endowing
a
group
of
workingmen
with
a
factory
plant
and
a
working
capital
for
experimentation
in
hours
and
wages
quite
as
groups
of
scholars
are
endowed
for
research
chicago
continued
to
devote
much
time
to
economic
discussion
and
remained
in
a
state
of
youthful
glamour
throughout
the
nineties
i
recall
a
young
methodist
minister
who
in
order
to
free
his
denomination
from
any
entanglement
in
his
discussion
of
the
economic
and
social
situation
moved
from
his
church
building
into
a
neighboring
hall
the
congregation
and
many
other
people
followed
him
there
and
he
later
took
to
the
street
corners
because
he
found
that
the
shabbiest
men
liked
that
best
professor
herron
filled
to
overflowing
a
downtown
hall
every
noon
with
a
series
of
talks
entitled
between
caesar
and
jesus
an
attempt
to
apply
the
teachings
of
the
gospel
to
the
situations
of
modern
commerce
a
half
dozen
publications
edited
with
some
ability
and
much
moral
enthusiasm
have
passed
away
perhaps
because
they
represented
pamphleteering
rather
than
journalism
and
came
to
a
natural
end
when
the
situation
changed
certainly
their
editors
suffered
criticism
and
poverty
on
behalf
of
the
causes
which
they
represented
unless
they
were
also
socialists
were
not
prominent
in
those
economic
discussions
although
they
were
steadily
making
an
effort
to
bring
order
into
the
unnecessary
industrial
confusion
they
belonged
to
the
second
of
the
two
classes
into
which
mill
divides
all
those
who
are
dissatisfied
with
human
life
as
it
is
and
whose
feelings
are
wholly
identified
with
its
radical
amendment
he
states
that
the
thoughts
of
one
class
are
in
the
region
of
ultimate
aims
of
the
highest
ideals
of
human
life
while
the
thoughts
of
the
other
are
in
the
region
of
the
immediately
useful
and
practically
attainable
the
meetings
of
our
social
science
club
were
carried
on
by
men
of
the
former
class
many
of
them
with
a
strong
religious
bias
who
constantly
challenged
the
church
to
assuage
the
human
spirit
thus
torn
and
bruised
in
the
tumult
of
a
time
disconsolate
these
men
were
so
serious
in
their
demand
for
religious
fellowship
and
several
young
clergymen
were
so
ready
to
respond
to
the
appeal
that
various
meetings
were
arranged
at
in
which
a
group
of
people
met
together
to
consider
the
social
question
not
in
a
spirit
of
discussion
but
in
prayer
and
meditation
these
clergymen
were
making
heroic
efforts
to
induce
their
churches
to
formally
consider
the
labor
situation
and
during
the
years
which
have
elapsed
since
then
many
denominations
of
the
christian
church
have
organized
labor
committees
but
at
that
time
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
beyond
the
society
in
the
established
church
of
england
to
consider
the
conditions
of
labor
during
that
decade
even
the
most
devoted
of
that
pioneer
church
society
failed
to
formulate
the
fervid
desire
for
juster
social
conditions
into
anything
more
convincing
than
a
literary
statement
and
the
christian
socialists
at
least
when
the
american
branch
held
its
annual
meeting
at
afforded
but
a
striking
portrayal
of
that
mood
in
which
so
many
of
our
religious
contemporaries
are
forced
to
live
i
remember
that
i
received
the
same
impression
when
i
attended
a
meeting
called
by
the
canon
of
an
english
cathedral
to
discuss
the
relation
of
the
church
to
labor
the
men
quickly
indicted
the
cathedral
for
its
uselessness
and
the
canon
asked
them
what
in
their
minds
should
be
its
future
the
men
promptly
replied
that
any
new
social
order
would
wish
of
course
to
preserve
beautiful
historic
buildings
that
although
they
would
dismiss
the
bishop
and
all
the
clergy
they
would
want
to
retain
one
or
two
scholars
as
custodians
and
interpreters
and
what
next
the
imperturbable
ecclesiastic
asked
we
would
democratize
it
replied
the
men
but
when
it
came
to
a
more
detailed
description
of
such
an
undertaking
the
discussion
broke
down
into
a
dozen
bits
although
illuminated
by
much
shrewd
wisdom
and
affording
a
clue
perhaps
as
to
the
destruction
of
the
bishop
palace
by
the
citizens
of
this
same
town
who
had
attacked
it
as
a
symbol
of
swollen
prosperity
during
the
bread
riots
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
century
on
the
other
hand
the
workingmen
who
continue
to
demand
help
from
the
church
thereby
acknowledge
their
kinship
as
does
the
son
who
continues
to
ask
bread
from
the
father
who
gives
him
a
stone
i
recall
an
incident
connected
with
a
prolonged
strike
in
chicago
on
the
part
of
the
typographical
unions
for
an
day
the
strike
had
been
conducted
in
a
most
orderly
manner
and
the
union
men
convinced
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
had
felt
aggrieved
because
one
of
the
religious
publishing
houses
in
chicago
had
constantly
opposed
them
some
of
the
younger
clergymen
of
the
denominations
who
were
friendly
to
the
cause
came
to
a
luncheon
at
where
the
situation
was
discussed
by
the
representatives
of
all
sides
the
clergymen
becoming
much
interested
in
the
idealism
with
which
an
officer
of
the
state
federation
of
labor
presented
the
cause
drew
from
him
the
story
of
his
search
for
fraternal
relation
he
said
that
at
fourteen
years
of
age
he
had
joined
a
church
hoping
to
find
it
there
he
had
later
become
a
member
of
many
fraternal
organizations
and
mutual
benefit
societies
and
although
much
impressed
by
their
rituals
he
was
disappointed
in
the
actual
fraternity
he
had
finally
found
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
the
cause
of
organized
labor
what
these
other
organizations
had
failed
to
give
him
an
opportunity
for
sacrificial
effort
chicago
thus
took
a
decade
to
discuss
the
problems
inherent
in
the
present
industrial
organization
and
to
consider
what
might
be
done
not
so
much
against
deliberate
aggression
as
against
brutal
confusion
and
neglect
quite
as
the
youth
of
promise
passed
through
a
mist
of
hope
before
he
settles
in
the
land
of
achievement
where
he
becomes
all
too
dull
and
literal
minded
and
yet
as
i
hastily
review
the
decade
in
chicago
which
followed
this
one
given
over
to
discussion
the
actual
attainment
of
these
early
hopes
so
far
as
they
have
been
realized
at
all
seem
to
have
come
from
men
of
affairs
rather
than
from
those
given
to
speculation
was
the
whole
decade
of
discussion
an
illustration
of
that
striking
fact
which
has
been
likened
to
the
changing
of
swords
in
hamlet
that
the
abstract
minds
at
length
yield
to
the
inevitable
or
at
least
grow
less
ardent
in
their
propaganda
while
the
concrete
minds
dealing
constantly
with
daily
affairs
in
the
end
demonstrate
the
reality
of
abstract
notions
i
remember
when
frederick
harrison
visited
that
i
was
much
disappointed
to
find
that
the
positivists
had
not
made
their
ardor
for
humanity
a
more
potent
factor
in
the
english
social
movement
as
i
was
surprised
during
a
visit
from
john
morley
to
find
that
he
representing
perhaps
the
type
of
man
whom
political
life
seemed
to
have
pulled
away
from
the
ideals
of
his
youth
had
yet
been
such
a
champion
of
democracy
in
the
full
tide
of
reaction
my
observations
were
much
too
superficial
to
be
of
value
and
certainly
both
men
were
well
grounded
in
philosophy
and
theory
of
social
reform
and
had
long
before
carefully
formulated
their
principles
as
the
new
english
labor
party
which
is
destined
to
break
up
the
reactionary
period
is
now
being
created
by
another
set
of
theorists
there
were
certainly
moments
during
the
heated
discussions
of
this
decade
when
nothing
seemed
so
important
as
right
theory
this
was
borne
in
upon
me
one
brilliant
evening
at
when
benjamin
kidd
author
of
the
social
evolution
was
pitted
against
victor
berger
of
milwaukee
even
then
considered
a
rising
man
in
the
socialist
party
at
any
rate
the
residents
of
discovered
that
while
their
first
impact
with
city
poverty
allied
them
to
groups
given
over
to
discussion
of
social
theories
their
sober
efforts
to
heal
neighborhood
ills
allied
them
to
general
public
movements
which
were
without
challenging
creeds
but
while
we
discovered
that
we
most
easily
secured
the
smallest
of
improvements
by
attaching
our
efforts
to
those
of
organized
bodies
nevertheless
these
very
organizations
would
have
been
impossible
had
not
the
public
conscience
been
aroused
and
the
community
sensibility
quickened
by
these
same
ardent
theorists
as
i
review
these
very
first
impressions
of
the
workers
in
unskilled
industries
living
in
a
depressed
quarter
of
the
city
i
realize
how
easy
it
was
for
us
to
see
exceptional
cases
of
hardship
as
typical
of
the
average
lot
and
yet
in
spite
of
alleviating
philanthropy
and
labor
legislation
the
indictment
of
tolstoy
applied
to
moscow
thirty
years
ago
still
fits
every
american
city
wherever
we
may
live
if
we
draw
a
circle
around
us
of
a
hundred
thousand
or
a
thousand
or
even
of
ten
miles
circumference
and
look
at
the
lives
of
those
men
and
women
who
are
inside
our
circle
we
shall
find
children
old
people
pregnant
women
sick
and
weak
persons
working
beyond
their
strength
who
have
neither
food
nor
rest
enough
to
support
them
and
who
for
this
reason
die
before
their
time
we
shall
see
others
full
grown
who
are
injured
and
needlessly
killed
by
dangerous
and
hurtful
tasks
as
the
american
city
is
awakening
to
it
slowly
perceives
the
civic
significance
of
these
industrial
conditions
and
perhaps
chicago
has
been
foremost
in
the
effort
to
connect
the
unregulated
overgrowth
of
the
huge
centers
of
population
with
the
astonishingly
rapid
development
of
industrial
enterprises
quite
as
chicago
was
foremost
to
carry
on
the
preliminary
discussion
through
which
a
basis
was
laid
for
likemindedness
and
the
coordination
of
diverse
wills
i
remember
an
astute
english
visitor
who
had
been
a
guest
in
a
score
of
american
cities
observed
that
it
was
hard
to
understand
the
local
pride
he
constantly
encountered
for
in
spite
of
the
boasting
on
the
part
of
leading
citizens
in
the
western
eastern
and
southern
towns
all
american
cities
seemed
to
him
essentially
alike
and
all
equally
the
results
of
an
industry
totally
unregulated
by
legislation
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
perhaps
all
this
general
discussion
was
inevitable
in
connection
with
the
early
settlements
as
they
in
turn
were
the
inevitable
result
of
theories
of
social
reform
which
in
their
full
enthusiasm
reached
america
by
way
of
england
only
in
the
last
decade
of
the
century
there
must
have
been
tough
fiber
somewhere
for
although
the
residents
of
were
often
baffled
by
the
radicalism
within
the
social
science
club
and
harassed
by
the
criticism
from
outside
we
still
continued
to
believe
that
such
discussion
should
be
carried
on
for
if
the
settlement
seeks
its
expression
through
social
activity
it
must
learn
the
difference
between
mere
social
unrest
and
spiritual
impulse
the
group
of
residents
which
by
the
end
of
the
decade
comprised
differed
widely
in
social
beliefs
from
the
girl
direct
from
the
country
who
looked
upon
all
social
unrest
as
mere
anarchy
to
the
resident
who
had
become
a
socialist
when
a
student
in
zurich
and
who
had
long
before
translated
from
the
german
engel
conditions
of
the
working
class
in
england
although
at
this
time
she
had
been
read
out
of
the
socialist
party
because
the
russian
and
german
impossibilists
suspected
her
fluent
english
as
she
always
lightly
explained
although
thus
diversified
in
social
beliefs
the
residents
became
solidly
united
through
our
mutual
experience
in
an
industrial
quarter
and
we
became
not
only
convinced
of
the
need
for
social
control
and
protective
legislation
but
also
of
the
value
of
this
preliminary
argument
this
decade
of
discussion
between
and
already
seems
remote
from
the
spirit
of
chicago
of
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
reproduce
this
earlier
period
it
must
reflect
the
essential
provisionality
of
everything
the
perpetual
moving
on
to
something
future
which
shall
supersede
the
present
that
paramount
impression
of
life
itself
which
affords
us
at
one
and
the
same
time
ground
for
despair
and
for
endless
and
varied
anticipation

chapter
x
pioneer
labor
legislation
in
illinois
our
very
first
christmas
at
when
we
as
yet
knew
nothing
of
child
labor
a
number
of
little
girls
refused
the
candy
which
was
offered
them
as
part
of
the
christmas
good
cheer
saying
simply
that
they
worked
in
a
candy
factory
and
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
it
we
discovered
that
for
six
weeks
they
had
worked
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
nine
at
night
and
they
were
exhausted
as
well
as
satiated
the
sharp
consciousness
of
stern
economic
conditions
was
thus
thrust
upon
us
in
the
midst
of
the
season
of
good
will
during
the
same
winter
three
boys
from
a
club
were
injured
at
one
machine
in
a
neighboring
factory
for
lack
of
a
guard
which
would
have
cost
but
a
few
dollars
when
the
injury
of
one
of
these
boys
resulted
in
his
death
we
felt
quite
sure
that
the
owners
of
the
factory
would
share
our
horror
and
remorse
and
that
they
would
do
everything
possible
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
such
a
tragedy
to
our
surprise
they
did
nothing
whatever
and
i
made
my
first
acquaintance
then
with
those
pathetic
documents
signed
by
the
parents
of
working
children
that
they
will
make
no
claim
for
damages
resulting
from
carelessness
the
visits
we
made
in
the
neighborhood
constantly
discovered
women
sewing
upon
sweatshop
work
and
often
they
were
assisted
by
incredibly
small
children
i
remember
a
little
girl
of
four
who
pulled
out
basting
threads
hour
after
hour
sitting
on
a
stool
at
the
feet
of
her
bohemian
mother
a
little
bunch
of
human
misery
but
even
for
that
there
was
no
legal
redress
for
the
only
law
in
illinois
with
any
provision
for
enforcement
had
been
secured
by
the
coal
miners
unions
and
was
confined
to
children
employed
in
mines
we
learned
to
know
many
families
in
which
the
working
children
contributed
to
the
support
of
their
parents
not
only
because
they
spoke
english
better
than
the
older
immigrants
and
were
willing
to
take
lower
wages
but
because
their
parents
gradually
found
it
easy
to
live
upon
their
earnings
a
south
italian
peasant
who
has
picked
olives
and
packed
oranges
from
his
toddling
babyhood
can
not
see
at
once
the
difference
between
the
outdoor
healthy
work
which
he
had
performed
in
the
varying
seasons
and
the
long
hours
of
monotonous
factory
life
which
his
child
encounters
when
he
goes
to
work
in
chicago
an
italian
father
came
to
us
in
great
grief
over
the
death
of
his
eldest
child
a
little
girl
of
twelve
who
had
brought
the
largest
wages
into
the
family
fund
in
the
midst
of
his
genuine
sorrow
he
said
she
was
the
oldest
kid
i
had
now
i
shall
have
to
go
back
to
work
again
until
the
next
one
is
able
to
take
care
of
me
the
man
was
only
and
had
hoped
to
retire
from
work
at
least
during
the
winters
no
foreman
cared
to
have
him
in
a
factory
untrained
and
unintelligent
as
he
was
it
was
much
easier
for
his
bright
little
girl
to
get
a
chance
to
paste
labels
on
a
box
than
for
him
to
secure
an
opportunity
to
carry
pig
iron
the
effect
on
the
child
was
what
no
one
concerned
thought
about
in
the
abnormal
effort
she
made
thus
prematurely
to
bear
the
weight
of
life
another
little
girl
of
thirteen
a
child
employed
in
a
laundry
at
a
heavy
task
beyond
her
strength
committed
suicide
because
she
had
borrowed
three
dollars
from
a
companion
which
she
could
not
repay
unless
she
confided
the
story
to
her
parents
and
gave
up
an
entire
week
wages
but
what
could
the
family
live
upon
that
week
in
case
she
did
her
child
mind
of
course
had
no
sense
of
proportion
and
carbolic
acid
appeared
inevitable
while
we
found
many
pathetic
cases
of
child
labor
and
victims
of
the
sweating
system
who
could
not
possibly
earn
enough
in
the
short
busy
season
to
support
themselves
during
the
rest
of
the
year
it
became
evident
that
we
must
add
carefully
collected
information
to
our
general
impression
of
neighborhood
conditions
if
we
would
make
it
of
any
genuine
value
there
was
at
that
time
no
statistical
information
on
chicago
industrial
conditions
and
florence
kelley
an
early
resident
of
suggested
to
the
illinois
state
bureau
of
labor
that
they
investigate
the
sweating
system
in
chicago
with
its
attendant
child
labor
the
head
of
the
bureau
adopted
this
suggestion
and
engaged
kelley
to
make
the
investigation
when
the
report
was
presented
to
the
illinois
legislature
a
special
committee
was
appointed
to
look
into
the
chicago
conditions
i
well
recall
that
on
the
sunday
the
members
of
this
commission
came
to
dine
at
our
hopes
ran
high
and
we
believed
that
at
last
some
of
the
worst
ills
under
which
our
neighbors
were
suffering
would
be
brought
to
an
end
as
a
result
of
its
investigations
this
committee
recommended
to
the
legislature
the
provisions
which
afterward
became
those
of
the
first
factory
law
of
illinois
regulating
the
sanitary
conditions
of
the
sweatshop
and
fixing
fourteen
as
the
age
at
which
a
child
might
be
employed
before
the
passage
of
the
law
could
be
secured
it
was
necessary
to
appeal
to
all
elements
of
the
community
and
a
little
group
of
us
addressed
the
open
meetings
of
and
of
benefit
societies
church
organizations
and
social
clubs
literally
every
evening
for
three
months
of
course
the
most
energetic
help
as
well
as
intelligent
understanding
came
from
the
the
central
labor
body
of
chicago
then
called
the
trades
and
labor
assembly
had
previously
appointed
a
committee
of
investigation
to
inquire
into
the
sweating
system
this
committee
consisted
of
five
delegates
from
the
unions
and
five
outside
their
membership
two
of
the
latter
were
residents
of
and
continued
with
the
unions
in
their
campaign
until
the
passage
of
illinois
first
factory
legislation
was
secured
a
statute
which
has
gradually
been
built
upon
by
many
citizens
until
illinois
stands
well
among
the
states
at
least
in
the
matter
of
protecting
her
children
the
residents
that
winter
had
their
first
experience
in
lobbying
i
remember
that
i
very
much
disliked
the
word
and
still
more
the
prospect
of
the
lobbying
itself
and
we
insisted
that
chicago
women
should
accompany
this
first
little
group
of
settlement
folk
who
with
moved
upon
the
state
capitol
in
behalf
of
factory
legislation
the
national
or
to
use
its
formal
name
the
general
federation
of
woman
clubs
had
been
organized
in
chicago
only
the
year
before
this
legislation
was
secured
the
federation
was
then
timid
in
regard
to
all
legislation
because
it
was
anxious
not
to
frighten
its
new
membership
although
its
second
president
henrotin
was
most
untiring
in
her
efforts
to
secure
this
law
it
was
perhaps
a
premature
effort
though
certainly
founded
upon
a
genuine
need
to
urge
that
a
clause
limiting
the
hours
of
all
women
working
in
factories
or
workshops
to
eight
a
day
or
a
week
should
be
inserted
in
the
first
factory
legislation
of
the
state
although
we
had
lived
at
but
three
years
when
we
urged
this
legislation
we
had
known
a
large
number
of
young
girls
who
were
constantly
exhausted
by
night
work
for
whatever
may
be
said
in
defense
of
night
work
for
men
few
women
are
able
to
endure
it
a
man
who
works
by
night
sleeps
regularly
by
day
but
a
woman
finds
it
impossible
to
put
aside
the
household
duties
which
crowd
upon
her
and
a
conscientious
girl
finds
it
hard
to
sleep
with
her
mother
washing
and
scrubbing
within
a
few
feet
of
her
bed
one
of
the
most
painful
impressions
of
those
first
years
is
that
of
pale
listless
girls
who
worked
regularly
in
a
factory
of
the
vicinity
which
was
then
running
full
night
time
these
girls
also
encountered
a
special
danger
in
the
early
morning
hours
as
they
returned
from
work
debilitated
and
exhausted
and
only
too
easily
convinced
that
a
drink
and
a
little
dancing
at
the
end
of
the
balls
in
the
saloon
dance
halls
was
what
they
needed
to
brace
them
one
of
the
girls
whom
we
then
knew
whose
name
chloe
seemed
to
fit
her
delicate
charm
craving
a
drink
to
dispel
her
lassitude
before
her
tired
feet
should
take
the
long
walk
home
had
thus
been
decoyed
into
a
saloon
where
the
soft
drink
was
followed
by
an
alcoholic
one
containing
knockout
drops
and
she
awoke
in
a
disreputable
rooming
house
too
frightened
and
disgraced
to
return
to
her
mother
thus
confronted
by
that
old
conundrum
of
the
interdependence
of
matter
and
spirit
the
conviction
was
forced
upon
us
that
long
and
exhausting
hours
of
work
are
almost
sure
to
be
followed
by
lurid
and
exciting
pleasures
that
the
power
to
overcome
temptation
reaches
its
limit
almost
automatically
with
that
of
physical
resistance
the
clause
in
this
first
factory
law
met
with
much
less
opposition
in
the
legislature
than
was
anticipated
and
was
enforced
for
a
year
before
it
was
pronounced
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
during
the
halcyon
months
when
it
was
a
law
a
large
and
enthusiastic
club
of
working
women
met
at
to
read
the
literature
on
the
subject
and
in
every
way
to
prepare
themselves
to
make
public
sentiment
in
favor
of
the
measure
which
meant
so
much
to
them
the
adverse
decision
in
the
test
case
the
progress
of
which
they
had
most
intelligently
followed
was
a
matter
of
great
disappointment
the
entire
experience
left
on
my
mind
a
mistrust
of
all
legislation
which
was
not
preceded
by
full
discussion
and
understanding
a
premature
measure
may
be
carried
through
a
legislature
by
perfectly
legitimate
means
and
still
fail
to
possess
vitality
and
a
sense
of
maturity
on
the
other
hand
the
administration
of
an
advanced
law
acts
somewhat
as
a
referendum
the
people
have
an
opportunity
for
two
years
to
see
the
effects
of
its
operation
if
they
choose
to
reopen
the
matter
at
the
next
general
assembly
it
can
be
discussed
with
experience
and
conviction
the
very
operation
of
the
law
has
performed
the
function
of
the
referendum
in
a
limited
use
of
the
term
founded
upon
some
such
compunction
the
sense
that
the
passage
of
the
child
labor
law
would
in
many
cases
work
hardship
was
never
absent
from
my
mind
during
the
earliest
years
of
its
operation
i
addressed
as
many
mothers
meetings
and
clubs
among
working
women
as
i
could
in
order
to
make
clear
the
object
of
the
law
and
the
ultimate
benefit
to
themselves
as
well
as
to
their
children
i
am
happy
to
remember
that
i
never
met
with
lack
of
understanding
among
the
widows
in
whose
behalf
many
prosperous
people
were
so
eloquent
these
widowed
mothers
would
say
why
of
course
that
is
what
i
am
working
for
to
give
the
children
a
chance
i
want
them
to
have
more
education
than
i
had
or
another
that
is
why
we
came
to
america
and
i
do
want
to
spoil
his
start
even
although
his
father
is
dead
or
different
in
america
a
boy
gets
left
if
he
is
educated
there
was
always
a
willingness
even
among
the
poorest
women
to
keep
on
with
the
hard
night
scrubbing
or
the
long
days
of
washing
for
the
children
sake
the
bitterest
opposition
to
the
law
came
from
the
large
glass
companies
who
were
so
accustomed
to
use
the
labor
of
children
that
they
were
convinced
the
manufacturing
of
glass
could
not
be
carried
on
without
it
fifteen
years
ago
the
state
of
illinois
as
well
as
chicago
exhibited
many
characteristics
of
the
pioneer
country
in
which
untrammeled
energy
and
an
early
start
were
still
the
most
highly
prized
generators
of
success
although
this
first
labor
legislation
was
but
bringing
illinois
into
line
with
the
nations
in
the
modern
industrial
world
which
have
long
been
obliged
for
their
own
sakes
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
workers
by
which
they
live
that
the
child
the
young
person
and
the
woman
may
be
protected
from
their
own
weakness
and
necessity
nevertheless
from
the
first
it
ran
counter
to
the
instinct
and
tradition
almost
to
the
very
religion
of
the
manufacturers
of
the
state
who
were
for
the
most
part
men
this
first
attempt
in
illinois
for
adequate
factory
legislation
also
was
associated
in
the
minds
of
businessmen
with
radicalism
because
the
law
was
secured
during
the
term
of
governor
altgeld
and
was
first
enforced
during
his
administration
while
nothing
in
its
genesis
or
spirit
could
be
further
from
anarchy
than
factory
legislation
and
while
the
first
law
in
illinois
was
still
far
behind
massachusetts
and
new
york
the
fact
that
governor
altgeld
pardoned
from
the
state
prison
the
anarchists
who
had
been
sentenced
there
after
the
haymarket
riot
gave
the
opponents
of
this
most
reasonable
legislation
a
quickly
utilized
opportunity
to
couple
it
with
that
detested
word
the
state
document
which
accompanied
governor
altgeld
pardon
gave
these
ungenerous
critics
a
further
opportunity
because
a
magnanimous
action
was
marred
by
personal
rancor
betraying
for
the
moment
the
infirmity
of
a
noble
mind
for
all
of
these
reasons
this
first
modification
of
the
undisturbed
control
of
the
aggressive
captains
of
industry
could
not
be
enforced
without
resistance
marked
by
dramatic
episodes
and
revolts
the
inception
of
the
law
had
already
become
associated
with
and
when
its
ministration
was
also
centered
there
we
inevitably
received
all
the
odium
which
these
first
efforts
entailed
kelley
was
appointed
the
first
factory
inspector
with
a
deputy
and
a
force
of
twelve
inspectors
to
enforce
the
law
both
kelley
and
her
assistant
stevens
lived
at
the
office
was
on
polk
street
directly
opposite
and
one
of
the
most
vigorous
deputies
was
the
president
of
the
jane
club
in
addition
one
of
the
early
men
residents
since
dean
of
a
state
law
school
acted
as
prosecutor
in
the
cases
brought
against
the
violators
of
the
law
chicago
had
for
years
been
notoriously
lax
in
the
administration
of
law
and
the
enforcement
of
an
unpopular
measure
was
resented
equally
by
the
president
of
a
large
manufacturing
concern
and
by
the
former
victim
of
a
sweatshop
who
had
started
a
place
of
his
own
whatever
the
sentiments
toward
the
new
law
on
the
part
of
the
employers
there
was
no
doubt
of
its
enthusiastic
reception
by
the
as
the
securing
of
the
law
had
already
come
from
them
and
through
the
years
which
have
elapsed
since
the
experience
of
the
residents
would
coincide
with
that
of
an
english
statesman
who
said
that
a
common
rule
for
the
standard
of
life
and
the
condition
of
labor
may
be
secured
by
legislation
but
it
must
be
maintained
by
trades
unionism
this
special
value
of
the
first
became
clear
to
the
residents
of
in
connection
with
the
sweating
system
we
early
found
that
the
women
in
the
sewing
trades
were
sorely
in
need
of
help
the
trade
was
thoroughly
disorganized
russian
and
polish
tailors
competing
against
tailors
unskilled
bohemian
and
italian
women
competing
against
both
these
women
seem
to
have
been
best
helped
through
the
use
of
the
label
when
unions
of
specialized
workers
in
the
trade
are
strong
enough
to
insist
that
the
manufacturers
shall
give
out
work
only
to
those
holding
union
cards
it
was
certainly
impressive
when
the
garment
makers
themselves
in
this
way
finally
succeeded
in
organizing
six
hundred
of
the
italian
women
in
our
immediate
vicinity
who
had
finished
garments
at
home
for
the
most
wretched
and
precarious
wages
to
be
sure
the
most
ignorant
women
only
knew
that
you
could
get
clothes
to
sew
from
the
places
where
they
paid
the
best
unless
you
had
a
card
but
through
the
veins
of
most
of
them
there
pulsed
the
quickened
blood
of
a
new
fellowship
a
sense
of
comfort
and
aid
which
had
been
laid
out
to
them
by
their
during
the
fourth
year
of
our
residence
at
we
found
ourselves
in
a
large
mass
meeting
ardently
advocating
the
passage
of
a
federal
measure
called
the
sulzer
bill
even
in
our
short
struggle
with
the
evils
of
the
sweating
system
it
did
not
seem
strange
that
the
center
of
the
effort
had
shifted
to
washington
for
by
that
time
we
had
realized
that
the
sanitary
regulation
of
sweatshops
by
city
officials
and
a
careful
enforcement
of
factory
legislation
by
state
factory
inspectors
will
not
avail
unless
each
city
and
state
shall
be
able
to
pass
and
enforce
a
code
of
comparatively
uniform
legislation
although
the
sulzer
act
failed
to
utilize
the
interstate
commerce
legislation
for
its
purpose
many
of
the
national
representatives
realized
for
the
first
time
that
only
by
federal
legislation
could
their
constituents
in
remote
country
places
be
protected
from
contagious
diseases
raging
in
new
york
or
chicago
for
many
country
doctors
testify
as
to
the
outbreak
of
scarlet
fever
in
rural
neighborhoods
after
the
children
have
begun
to
wear
the
winter
overcoats
and
cloaks
which
have
been
sent
from
infected
city
sweatshops
through
our
efforts
to
modify
the
sweating
system
the
residents
gradually
became
committed
to
the
fortunes
of
the
consumers
league
an
organization
which
for
years
has
been
approaching
the
question
of
the
underpaid
sewing
woman
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
ultimate
responsibility
lodged
in
the
consumer
it
becomes
more
reasonable
to
make
the
presentation
of
the
sweatshop
situation
through
this
league
as
it
is
more
effectual
to
work
with
them
for
the
extension
of
legal
provisions
in
the
slow
upbuilding
of
that
code
of
legislation
which
is
alone
sufficient
to
protect
the
home
from
the
dangers
incident
to
the
sweating
system
the
consumers
league
seems
to
afford
the
best
method
of
approach
for
the
protection
of
girls
in
department
stores
i
recall
a
group
of
girls
from
a
neighboring
emporium
who
applied
to
for
dancing
parties
on
alternate
sunday
afternoons
in
reply
to
our
protest
they
told
us
they
not
only
worked
late
every
evening
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
each
was
supposed
to
have
two
nights
a
week
off
and
every
sunday
morning
but
that
on
alternate
sunday
afternoons
they
were
required
to
sort
the
stock
over
and
over
again
meetings
called
by
the
clerks
union
and
others
have
been
held
at
protesting
against
these
incredibly
long
hours
little
modification
has
come
about
however
during
our
twenty
years
of
residence
although
one
large
store
in
the
bohemian
quarter
closes
all
day
on
sunday
and
many
of
the
others
for
three
nights
a
week
in
spite
of
the
sunday
work
these
girls
prefer
the
outlying
department
stores
to
those
downtown
there
is
more
social
intercourse
with
the
customers
more
kindliness
and
social
equality
between
the
saleswomen
and
the
managers
and
above
all
the
girls
have
the
protection
naturally
afforded
by
friends
and
neighbors
and
they
are
free
from
that
suspicion
which
so
often
haunts
the
girls
downtown
that
their
fellow
workers
may
not
be
nice
girls
in
the
first
years
of
we
came
across
no
among
the
women
workers
and
i
think
perhaps
that
only
one
union
composed
solely
of
women
was
to
be
found
in
chicago
then
that
of
the
bookbinders
i
easily
recall
the
evening
when
the
president
of
this
pioneer
organization
accepted
an
invitation
to
take
dinner
at
she
came
in
rather
a
recalcitrant
mood
expecting
to
be
patronized
and
so
suspicious
of
our
motives
that
it
was
only
after
she
had
been
persuaded
to
become
a
guest
of
the
house
for
several
weeks
in
order
to
find
out
about
us
for
herself
that
she
was
convinced
of
our
sincerity
and
of
the
ability
of
outsiders
to
be
of
any
service
to
working
women
she
afterward
became
closely
identified
with
and
her
hearty
cooperation
was
assured
until
she
moved
to
boston
and
became
a
general
organizer
for
the
american
federation
of
labor
the
women
shirt
makers
and
the
women
cloak
makers
were
both
organized
at
as
was
also
the
dorcas
federal
labor
union
which
had
been
founded
through
the
efforts
of
a
working
woman
then
one
of
the
residents
the
latter
union
met
once
a
month
in
our
drawing
room
it
was
composed
of
representatives
from
all
the
unions
in
the
city
which
included
women
in
their
membership
and
also
received
other
women
in
sympathy
with
unionism
it
was
accorded
representation
in
the
central
labor
body
of
the
city
and
later
it
joined
its
efforts
with
those
of
others
to
found
the
woman
union
label
league
in
what
we
considered
a
praiseworthy
effort
to
unite
it
with
other
organizations
the
president
of
a
leading
woman
club
applied
for
membership
we
were
so
sure
of
her
election
that
she
stood
just
outside
of
the
door
or
in
language
the
wicket
gate
while
her
name
was
voted
upon
to
our
chagrin
she
did
not
receive
enough
votes
to
secure
her
admission
not
because
the
working
girls
as
they
were
careful
to
state
did
not
admire
her
but
because
she
seemed
to
belong
to
the
other
side
fortunately
the
woman
so
thoroughly
understood
the
vote
and
her
interest
in
working
women
was
so
genuine
that
it
was
less
than
a
decade
afterward
when
she
was
elected
to
the
presidency
of
the
national
woman
trades
union
league
the
incident
and
the
sequel
registers
perhaps
the
change
in
chicago
toward
the
labor
movement
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
general
social
movement
concerning
all
members
of
society
and
not
merely
a
class
struggle
some
such
public
estimate
of
the
labor
movement
was
brought
home
to
chicago
during
several
conspicuous
strikes
at
least
labor
legislation
has
twice
been
inaugurated
because
its
need
was
thus
made
clear
after
the
pullman
strike
various
elements
in
the
community
were
unexpectedly
brought
together
that
they
might
soberly
consider
and
rectify
the
weakness
in
the
legal
structure
which
the
strike
had
revealed
these
citizens
arranged
for
a
large
and
representative
convention
to
be
held
in
chicago
on
industrial
conciliation
and
arbitration
i
served
as
secretary
of
the
committee
from
the
new
civic
federation
having
the
matter
in
charge
and
our
hopes
ran
high
when
as
a
result
of
the
agitation
the
illinois
legislature
passed
a
law
creating
a
state
board
of
conciliation
and
arbitration
but
even
a
state
board
can
not
accomplish
more
than
public
sentiment
authorizes
and
sustains
and
we
might
easily
have
been
discouraged
in
those
early
days
could
we
have
foreseen
some
of
the
industrial
disturbances
which
have
since
disgraced
chicago
this
law
embodied
the
best
provisions
of
the
then
existing
laws
for
the
arbitration
of
industrial
disputes
at
the
time
the
word
arbitration
was
still
a
word
to
conjure
with
and
many
chicago
citizens
were
convinced
not
only
of
the
danger
and
futility
involved
in
the
open
warfare
of
opposing
social
forces
but
further
believed
that
the
search
for
justice
and
righteousness
in
industrial
relations
was
made
infinitely
more
difficult
thereby
the
pullman
strike
afforded
much
illumination
to
many
chicago
people
before
it
there
had
been
nothing
in
my
experience
to
reveal
that
distinct
cleavage
of
society
which
a
general
strike
at
least
momentarily
affords
certainly
during
all
those
dark
days
of
the
pullman
strike
the
growth
of
class
bitterness
was
most
obvious
the
fact
that
the
settlement
maintained
avenues
of
intercourse
with
both
sides
seemed
to
give
it
opportunity
for
nothing
but
a
realization
of
the
bitterness
and
division
along
class
lines
i
had
known
pullman
and
had
seen
his
genuine
pride
and
pleasure
in
the
model
town
he
had
built
with
so
much
care
and
i
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
many
of
the
pullman
employees
during
the
strike
when
i
was
sent
from
a
citizens
arbitration
committee
to
their
first
meetings
held
in
a
hall
in
the
neighboring
village
of
kensington
and
when
i
was
invited
to
the
modest
supper
tables
laid
in
the
model
houses
the
employees
then
expected
a
speedy
settlement
and
no
one
doubted
but
that
all
the
grievances
connected
with
the
straw
bosses
would
be
quickly
remedied
and
that
the
benevolence
which
had
built
the
model
town
would
not
fail
them
they
were
sure
that
the
straw
bosses
had
misrepresented
the
state
of
affairs
for
this
very
first
awakening
to
class
consciousness
bore
many
traces
of
the
servility
on
one
side
and
the
arrogance
on
the
other
which
had
so
long
prevailed
in
the
model
town
the
entire
strike
demonstrated
how
often
the
outcome
of
industrial
disturbances
is
dependent
upon
the
personal
will
of
the
employer
or
the
temperament
of
a
strike
leader
those
familiar
with
strikes
know
only
too
well
how
much
they
are
influenced
by
poignant
domestic
situations
by
the
troubled
consciences
of
the
minority
directors
by
the
suffering
women
and
children
by
the
keen
excitement
of
the
struggle
by
the
religious
scruples
sternly
suppressed
but
occasionally
asserting
themselves
now
on
one
side
and
now
on
the
other
and
by
that
undefined
psychology
of
the
crowd
which
we
understand
so
little
all
of
these
factors
also
influence
the
public
and
do
much
to
determine
popular
sympathy
and
judgment
in
the
early
days
of
the
pullman
strike
as
i
was
coming
down
in
the
elevator
of
the
auditorium
hotel
from
one
of
the
futile
meetings
of
the
arbitration
committee
i
met
an
acquaintance
who
angrily
said
that
the
strikers
ought
all
to
be
shot
as
i
had
heard
nothing
so
bloodthirsty
as
this
either
from
the
most
enraged
capitalist
or
from
the
most
desperate
of
the
men
and
was
interested
to
find
the
cause
of
such
a
senseless
outbreak
i
finally
discovered
that
the
first
ten
thousand
dollars
which
my
acquaintance
had
ever
saved
requiring
he
said
years
of
effort
from
the
time
he
was
twelve
years
old
until
he
was
thirty
had
been
lost
as
the
result
of
a
strike
he
clinched
his
argument
that
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
with
the
statement
that
no
one
need
expect
him
to
have
any
sympathy
with
strikers
or
with
their
affairs
a
very
intimate
and
personal
experience
revealed
at
least
to
myself
my
constant
dread
of
the
spreading
ill
will
at
the
height
of
the
sympathetic
strike
my
oldest
sister
who
was
convalescing
from
a
long
illness
in
a
hospital
near
chicago
became
suddenly
very
much
worse
while
i
was
able
to
reach
her
at
once
every
possible
obstacle
of
a
delayed
and
blocked
transportation
system
interrupted
the
journey
of
her
husband
and
children
who
were
hurrying
to
her
bedside
from
a
distant
state
as
the
end
drew
nearer
and
i
was
obliged
to
reply
to
my
constant
inquiries
that
her
family
had
not
yet
come
i
was
filled
with
a
profound
apprehension
lest
her
last
hours
should
be
touched
with
resentment
toward
those
responsible
for
the
delay
lest
her
unutterable
longing
should
at
the
very
end
be
tinged
with
bitterness
she
must
have
divined
what
was
in
my
mind
for
at
last
she
said
each
time
after
the
repetition
of
my
sad
news
i
do
blame
any
one
i
am
not
judging
them
my
heart
was
comforted
and
heavy
at
the
same
time
but
how
many
more
such
moments
of
sorrow
and
death
were
being
made
difficult
and
lonely
throughout
the
land
and
how
much
would
these
experiences
add
to
the
lasting
bitterness
that
touch
of
which
makes
the
spirit
of
forgiveness
impossible
when
i
returned
to
chicago
from
the
quiet
country
i
saw
the
federal
troops
encamped
about
the
post
office
almost
everyone
on
halsted
street
wearing
a
white
ribbon
the
emblem
of
the
strikers
side
the
residents
at
divided
in
opinion
as
to
the
righteousness
of
this
or
that
measure
and
no
one
able
to
secure
any
real
information
as
to
which
side
was
burning
the
cars
after
the
pullman
strike
i
made
an
attempt
to
analyze
in
a
paper
which
i
called
the
modern
king
lear
the
inevitable
revolt
of
human
nature
against
the
plans
pullman
had
made
for
his
employees
the
miscarriage
of
which
appeared
to
him
such
black
ingratitude
it
seemed
to
me
unendurable
not
to
make
some
effort
to
gather
together
the
social
implications
of
the
failure
of
this
benevolent
employer
and
its
relation
to
the
demand
for
a
more
democratic
administration
of
industry
doubtless
the
paper
represented
a
certain
excess
of
participation
to
use
a
gentle
phrase
of
charles
lamb
in
preference
to
a
more
emphatic
one
used
by
pullman
himself
the
last
picture
of
the
pullman
strike
which
i
distinctly
recall
was
three
years
later
when
one
of
the
strike
leaders
came
to
see
me
although
out
of
work
for
most
of
the
time
since
the
strike
he
had
been
undisturbed
for
six
months
in
the
repair
shops
of
a
company
under
an
assumed
name
but
he
had
at
that
moment
been
discovered
and
dismissed
he
was
a
superior
type
of
english
workingman
but
as
he
stood
there
broken
and
discouraged
believing
himself
so
that
his
skill
could
never
be
used
again
filled
with
sorrow
over
the
loss
of
his
wife
who
had
recently
died
after
an
illness
with
distressing
mental
symptoms
realizing
keenly
the
lack
of
the
respectable
way
of
living
he
had
always
until
now
been
able
to
maintain
he
seemed
to
me
an
epitome
of
the
wretched
human
waste
such
a
strike
implies
i
fervently
hoped
that
the
new
arbitration
law
would
prohibit
in
chicago
forever
more
such
brutal
and
ineffective
methods
of
settling
industrial
disputes
and
yet
even
as
early
as
we
found
the
greatest
difficulty
in
applying
the
arbitration
law
to
the
garment
workers
strike
although
it
was
finally
accomplished
after
various
mass
meetings
had
urged
it
the
cruelty
and
waste
of
the
strike
as
an
implement
for
securing
the
most
reasonable
demands
came
to
me
at
another
time
during
the
long
strike
of
the
clothing
cutters
they
had
protested
not
only
against
various
wrongs
of
their
own
but
against
the
fact
that
the
tailors
employed
by
the
custom
merchants
were
obliged
to
furnish
their
own
workshops
and
thus
bore
a
burden
of
rent
which
belonged
to
the
employer
one
of
the
leaders
in
this
strike
whom
i
had
known
for
several
years
as
a
sober
industrious
and
unusually
intelligent
man
i
saw
gradually
break
down
during
the
many
trying
weeks
and
at
last
suffer
a
complete
moral
collapse
he
was
a
man
of
sensitive
organization
under
the
necessity
as
is
every
leader
during
a
strike
to
address
the
same
body
of
men
day
after
day
with
an
appeal
sufficiently
emotional
to
respond
to
their
sense
of
injury
to
receive
callers
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
to
sympathize
with
all
the
distress
of
the
strikers
who
see
their
families
daily
suffering
he
must
do
it
all
with
the
sickening
sense
of
the
increasing
privation
in
his
own
home
and
in
this
case
with
the
consciousness
that
failure
was
approaching
nearer
each
day
this
man
accustomed
to
the
monotony
of
his
workbench
and
suddenly
thrown
into
a
new
situation
showed
every
sign
of
nervous
fatigue
before
the
final
collapse
came
he
disappeared
after
the
strike
and
i
did
not
see
him
for
ten
years
but
when
he
returned
he
immediately
began
talking
about
the
old
grievances
which
he
had
repeated
so
often
that
he
could
talk
of
nothing
else
it
was
easy
to
recognize
the
same
nervous
symptoms
which
the
lecturer
exhibits
who
has
depended
upon
the
exploitation
of
his
own
experiences
to
keep
himself
going
one
of
his
stories
was
indeed
pathetic
his
employer
during
the
busy
season
had
met
him
one
sunday
afternoon
in
lincoln
park
whither
he
had
taken
his
three
youngest
children
one
of
whom
had
been
ill
the
employer
scolded
him
for
thus
wasting
his
time
and
roughly
asked
why
he
had
not
taken
home
enough
work
to
keep
himself
busy
through
the
day
the
story
was
quite
credible
because
the
residents
of
have
had
many
opportunities
to
see
the
worker
driven
ruthlessly
during
the
season
and
left
in
idleness
for
long
weeks
afterward
we
have
slowly
come
to
realize
that
periodical
idleness
as
well
as
the
payment
of
wages
insufficient
for
maintenance
of
the
manual
worker
in
full
industrial
and
domestic
efficiency
stand
economically
on
the
same
footing
with
the
sweated
industries
the
overwork
of
women
and
employment
of
children
but
of
all
the
aspects
of
social
misery
nothing
is
so
heartbreaking
as
unemployment
and
it
was
inevitable
that
we
should
see
much
of
it
in
a
neighborhood
where
low
rents
attracted
the
poorly
paid
worker
and
many
newly
arrived
immigrants
who
were
first
employed
in
gangs
upon
railroad
extensions
and
similar
undertakings
the
sturdy
peasants
eager
for
work
were
either
the
victims
of
the
padrone
who
fleeced
them
unmercifully
both
in
securing
a
place
to
work
and
then
in
supplying
them
with
food
or
they
became
the
mere
sport
of
unscrupulous
employment
agencies
made
an
investigation
both
of
the
padrone
and
of
the
agencies
in
our
immediate
vicinity
and
the
outcome
confirming
what
we
already
suspected
we
eagerly
threw
ourselves
into
a
movement
to
procure
free
employment
bureaus
under
state
control
until
a
law
authorizing
such
bureaus
and
giving
the
officials
intrusted
with
their
management
power
to
regulate
private
employment
agencies
passed
the
illinois
legislature
in
the
history
of
these
bureaus
demonstrates
the
tendency
we
all
have
to
consider
a
legal
enactment
in
itself
an
achievement
and
to
grow
careless
in
regard
to
its
administration
and
actual
results
for
an
investigation
into
the
situation
ten
years
later
discovered
that
immigrants
were
still
shamefully
imposed
upon
a
group
of
bulgarians
were
found
who
had
been
sent
to
work
in
arkansas
where
their
services
were
not
needed
they
walked
back
to
chicago
only
to
secure
their
next
job
in
oklahoma
and
to
pay
another
railroad
fare
as
well
as
another
commission
to
the
agency
not
only
was
there
no
method
by
which
the
men
not
needed
in
arkansas
could
know
that
there
was
work
in
oklahoma
unless
they
came
back
to
chicago
to
find
it
out
but
there
was
no
certainty
that
they
might
not
be
obliged
to
walk
back
from
oklahoma
because
the
chicago
agency
had
already
sent
out
too
many
men
this
investigation
of
the
employment
bureau
resources
of
chicago
was
undertaken
by
the
league
for
the
protection
of
immigrants
with
whom
it
is
possible
for
to
cooperate
whenever
an
investigation
of
the
immigrant
colonies
in
our
immediate
neighborhood
seems
necessary
as
was
recently
done
in
regard
to
the
greek
colonies
of
chicago
the
superintendent
of
this
league
miss
grace
abbott
is
a
resident
of
and
all
of
our
later
attempts
to
secure
justice
and
opportunity
for
immigrants
are
much
more
effective
through
the
league
and
when
we
speak
before
a
congressional
committee
in
washington
concerning
the
needs
of
chicago
immigrants
we
represent
the
league
as
well
as
our
own
neighbors
it
is
in
connection
with
the
first
factory
employment
of
newly
arrived
immigrants
and
the
innumerable
difficulties
attached
to
their
first
adjustment
that
some
of
the
most
profound
industrial
disturbances
in
chicago
have
come
about
under
any
attempt
at
classification
these
strikes
belong
more
to
the
general
social
movement
than
to
the
industrial
conflict
for
the
strike
is
an
implement
used
most
rashly
by
unorganized
labor
who
after
they
are
in
difficulties
call
upon
the
for
organization
and
direction
they
are
similar
to
those
strikes
which
are
inaugurated
by
the
unions
on
behalf
of
unskilled
labor
in
neither
case
do
the
hastily
organized
unions
usually
hold
after
the
excitement
of
the
moment
has
subsided
and
the
most
valuable
result
of
such
strikes
is
the
expanding
consciousness
of
the
solidarity
of
the
workers
this
was
certainly
the
result
of
the
chicago
stockyard
strike
in
inaugurated
on
behalf
of
the
immigrant
laborers
and
so
conspicuously
carried
on
without
violence
that
although
thousand
workers
were
idle
during
the
entire
summer
there
were
fewer
arrests
in
the
stockyards
district
than
the
average
summer
months
afford
however
the
story
of
this
strike
should
not
be
told
from
but
from
the
university
of
chicago
settlement
where
miss
mary
mcdowell
performed
such
signal
public
service
during
that
trying
summer
it
would
be
interesting
to
trace
how
much
of
the
subsequent
exposure
of
conditions
and
attempts
at
governmental
control
of
this
huge
industry
had
their
genesis
in
this
first
attempt
of
the
unskilled
workers
to
secure
a
higher
standard
of
living
certainly
the
industrial
conflict
when
epitomized
in
a
strike
centers
public
attention
on
conditions
as
nothing
else
can
do
a
strike
is
one
of
the
most
exciting
episodes
in
modern
life
and
as
it
assumes
the
characteristics
of
a
game
the
entire
population
of
a
city
becomes
divided
into
two
cheering
sides
in
such
moments
the
public
who
ought
to
be
depended
upon
as
a
referee
practically
disappears
anyone
who
tries
to
keep
the
attitude
of
nonpartisanship
which
is
perhaps
an
impossible
one
is
quickly
under
suspicion
by
both
sides
at
least
that
was
the
fate
of
a
group
of
citizens
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
chicago
to
arbitrate
during
the
stormy
teamsters
strike
which
occurred
in
we
sat
through
a
long
sunday
afternoon
in
the
mayor
office
in
the
city
hall
talking
first
with
the
labor
men
and
then
with
the
group
of
capitalists
the
undertaking
was
the
more
futile
in
that
we
were
all
practically
the
dupes
of
a
new
type
of
industrial
conspiracy
successfully
inaugurated
in
chicago
by
a
close
compact
between
the
coal
teamsters
union
and
the
coal
team
owners
association
who
had
formed
a
kind
of
monopoly
hitherto
new
to
a
public
the
stormy
teamsters
strike
ostensibly
undertaken
in
defense
of
the
garment
workers
but
really
arising
from
causes
so
obscure
and
dishonorable
that
they
have
never
yet
been
made
public
was
the
culmination
of
a
type
of
which
had
developed
in
chicago
during
the
preceding
decade
in
which
corruption
had
flourished
almost
as
openly
as
it
had
previously
done
in
the
city
hall
this
corruption
sometimes
took
the
form
of
grafting
after
the
manner
of
samuel
parks
in
new
york
sometimes
that
of
political
deals
in
the
delivery
of
the
labor
vote
and
sometimes
that
of
a
combination
between
capital
and
labor
hunting
together
at
various
times
during
these
years
the
better
type
of
had
made
a
firm
stand
against
this
corruption
and
a
determined
effort
to
eradicate
it
from
the
labor
movement
not
unlike
the
general
reform
effort
of
many
american
cities
against
political
corruption
this
reform
movement
in
the
chicago
federation
of
labor
had
its
martyrs
and
more
than
one
man
nearly
lost
his
life
through
the
slugging
methods
employed
by
the
powerful
corruptionists
and
yet
even
in
the
midst
of
these
things
were
found
touching
examples
of
fidelity
to
the
earlier
principles
of
brotherhood
totally
untouched
by
the
corruption
at
one
time
the
scrubwomen
in
the
downtown
office
buildings
had
a
union
of
their
own
affiliated
with
the
elevator
men
and
the
janitors
although
the
union
was
used
merely
as
a
weapon
in
the
fight
of
the
coal
teamsters
against
the
use
of
natural
gas
in
downtown
buildings
it
did
not
prevent
the
women
from
getting
their
first
glimpse
into
the
fellowship
and
the
sense
of
protection
which
is
the
great
gift
of
to
the
unskilled
unbefriended
worker
i
remember
in
a
meeting
held
at
one
sunday
afternoon
that
the
president
of
a
local
of
scrubwomen
stood
up
to
relate
her
experience
she
told
first
of
the
long
years
in
which
the
fear
of
losing
her
job
and
the
fluctuating
pay
were
harder
to
bear
than
the
hard
work
itself
when
she
had
regarded
all
the
other
women
who
scrubbed
in
the
same
building
merely
as
rivals
and
was
most
afraid
of
the
most
miserable
because
they
offered
to
work
for
less
and
less
as
they
were
pressed
harder
and
harder
by
debt
then
she
told
of
the
change
that
had
come
when
the
elevator
men
and
even
the
lordly
janitors
had
talked
to
her
about
an
organization
and
had
said
that
they
must
all
stand
together
she
told
how
gradually
she
came
to
feel
sure
of
her
job
and
of
her
regular
pay
and
she
was
even
starting
to
buy
a
house
now
that
she
could
calculate
how
much
she
could
have
for
sure
neither
she
nor
any
of
the
other
members
knew
that
the
same
combination
which
had
organized
the
scrubwomen
into
a
union
later
destroyed
it
during
a
strike
inaugurated
for
their
own
purposes
that
a
settlement
is
drawn
into
the
labor
issues
of
its
city
can
seem
remote
to
its
purpose
only
to
those
who
fail
to
realize
that
so
far
as
the
present
industrial
system
thwarts
our
ethical
demands
not
only
for
social
righteousness
but
for
social
order
a
settlement
is
committed
to
an
effort
to
understand
and
as
far
as
possible
to
alleviate
it
that
in
this
effort
it
should
be
drawn
into
fellowship
with
the
local
efforts
of
is
most
obvious
this
identity
of
aim
apparently
commits
the
settlement
in
the
public
mind
to
all
the
faiths
and
works
of
actual
fellowship
has
so
long
implied
similarity
of
creed
that
the
fact
that
the
settlement
often
differs
widely
from
the
policy
pursued
by
and
clearly
expresses
that
difference
does
not
in
the
least
change
public
opinion
in
regard
to
its
identification
this
is
especially
true
in
periods
of
industrial
disturbance
although
it
is
exactly
at
such
moments
that
the
themselves
are
suspicious
of
all
but
their
own
kind
it
is
during
the
much
longer
periods
between
strikes
that
the
settlement
fellowship
with
is
most
satisfactory
in
the
agitation
for
labor
legislation
and
similar
undertakings
the
first
officers
of
the
chicago
trades
union
league
were
residents
of
settlements
although
they
can
claim
little
share
in
the
later
record
the
league
made
in
securing
the
passage
of
the
illinois
law
for
women
and
in
its
many
other
fine
undertakings
nevertheless
the
reaction
of
strikes
upon
chicago
settlements
affords
an
interesting
study
in
social
psychology
for
whether
is
in
any
wise
identified
with
the
strike
or
not
makes
no
difference
when
labor
is
in
disgrace
we
are
always
regarded
as
belonging
to
it
and
share
the
opprobrium
in
the
public
excitement
following
the
pullman
strike
lost
many
friends
later
the
teamsters
strike
caused
another
such
defection
although
my
office
in
both
cases
had
been
solely
that
of
a
duly
appointed
arbitrator
there
is
however
a
certain
comfort
in
the
assumption
i
have
often
encountered
that
wherever
one
judgment
might
place
the
justice
of
a
given
situation
it
is
understood
that
sympathy
is
not
alienated
by
wrongdoing
and
that
through
this
sympathy
one
is
still
subject
to
vicarious
suffering
i
recall
an
incident
during
a
turbulent
chicago
strike
which
brought
me
much
comfort
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
a
luncheon
to
which
i
had
accepted
an
invitation
the
waitress
whom
i
did
not
know
said
to
my
prospective
hostess
that
she
was
sure
i
could
not
come
upon
being
asked
for
her
reason
she
replied
that
she
had
seen
in
the
morning
paper
that
the
strikers
had
killed
a
scab
and
she
was
sure
that
i
would
feel
quite
too
badly
about
such
a
thing
to
be
able
to
keep
a
social
engagement
in
spite
of
the
confused
issues
she
evidently
realized
my
despair
over
the
violence
in
a
strike
quite
as
definitely
as
if
she
had
been
told
about
it
perhaps
that
sort
of
suffering
and
the
attempt
to
interpret
opposing
forces
to
each
other
will
long
remain
a
function
of
the
settlement
unsatisfactory
and
difficult
as
the
role
often
becomes
there
has
gradually
developed
between
the
various
settlements
of
chicago
a
warm
fellowship
founded
upon
a
resulting
from
similar
experiences
quite
as
identity
of
interest
and
endeavor
develop
an
enduring
relation
between
the
residents
of
the
same
settlement
this
sense
of
comradeship
is
never
stronger
than
during
the
hardships
and
perplexities
of
a
strike
of
unskilled
workers
revolting
against
the
conditions
which
drag
them
even
below
the
level
of
their
european
life
at
such
time
the
residents
in
various
settlements
are
driven
to
a
standard
of
life
argument
running
somewhat
in
this
wise
that
as
the
very
existence
of
the
state
depends
upon
the
character
of
its
citizens
therefore
if
certain
industrial
conditions
are
forcing
the
workers
below
the
standard
of
decency
it
becomes
possible
to
deduce
the
right
of
state
regulation
even
as
late
as
the
stockyard
strike
this
line
of
argument
was
denounced
as
socialism
although
it
has
since
been
confirmed
as
wise
statesmanship
by
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
which
was
apparently
secured
through
the
masterly
argument
of
the
brandeis
brief
in
the
oregon
case
in
such
wise
the
residents
of
an
industrial
neighborhood
gradually
comprehend
the
close
connection
of
their
own
difficulties
with
national
and
even
international
movements
the
residents
in
the
chicago
settlements
became
pioneer
members
in
the
american
branch
of
the
international
league
for
labor
legislation
because
their
neighborhood
experiences
had
made
them
only
too
conscious
of
the
dire
need
for
protective
legislation
in
such
a
league
with
its
ardent
members
in
every
industrial
nation
of
europe
with
its
encouraging
reports
of
the
abolition
of
all
night
work
for
women
in
six
european
nations
with
its
careful
observations
on
the
results
of
employer
liability
legislation
and
protection
of
machinery
one
becomes
identified
with
a
movement
of
significance
and
manifold
manifestation

chapter
xi
immigrants
and
their
children
from
our
very
first
months
at
we
found
it
much
easier
to
deal
with
the
first
generation
of
crowded
city
life
than
with
the
second
or
third
because
it
is
more
natural
and
cast
in
a
simpler
mold
the
italian
and
bohemian
peasants
who
live
in
chicago
still
put
on
their
bright
holiday
clothes
on
a
sunday
and
go
to
visit
their
cousins
they
tramp
along
with
at
least
a
suggestion
of
having
once
walked
over
plowed
fields
and
breathed
country
air
the
second
generation
of
city
poor
too
often
have
no
holiday
clothes
and
consider
their
relations
a
bad
lot
i
have
heard
a
drunken
man
in
a
maudlin
stage
babble
of
his
good
country
mother
and
imagine
he
was
driving
the
cows
home
and
i
knew
that
his
little
son
who
laughed
loud
at
him
would
be
drunk
earlier
in
life
and
would
have
no
pastoral
interlude
to
his
ravings
hospitality
still
survives
among
foreigners
although
it
is
buried
under
false
pride
among
the
poorest
americans
one
thing
seemed
clear
in
regard
to
entertaining
immigrants
to
preserve
and
keep
whatever
of
value
their
past
life
contained
and
to
bring
them
in
contact
with
a
better
type
of
americans
for
several
years
every
saturday
evening
the
entire
families
of
our
italian
neighbors
were
our
guests
these
evenings
were
very
popular
during
our
first
winters
at
many
educated
italians
helped
us
and
the
house
became
known
as
a
place
where
italians
were
welcome
and
where
national
holidays
were
observed
they
come
to
us
with
their
petty
lawsuits
sad
relics
of
the
vendetta
with
their
incorrigible
boys
with
their
hospital
cases
with
their
aspirations
for
american
clothes
and
with
their
needs
for
an
interpreter
an
editor
of
an
italian
paper
made
a
genuine
connection
between
us
and
the
italian
colony
not
only
with
the
neapolitans
and
the
sicilians
of
the
immediate
neighborhood
but
with
the
educated
connazionali
throughout
the
city
until
he
went
south
to
start
an
agricultural
colony
in
alabama
in
the
establishment
of
which
heartily
cooperated
possibly
the
south
italians
more
than
any
other
immigrants
represent
the
pathetic
stupidity
of
agricultural
people
crowded
into
city
tenements
and
we
were
much
gratified
when
thirty
peasant
families
were
induced
to
move
upon
the
land
which
they
knew
so
well
how
to
cultivate
the
starting
of
this
colony
however
was
a
very
expensive
affair
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
colonists
purchased
the
land
at
two
dollars
an
acre
they
needed
much
more
than
raw
land
and
although
it
was
possible
to
collect
the
small
sums
necessary
to
sustain
them
during
the
hard
time
of
the
first
two
years
we
were
fully
convinced
that
undertakings
of
this
sort
could
be
conducted
properly
only
by
colonization
societies
such
as
england
has
established
or
better
still
by
enlarging
the
functions
of
the
federal
department
of
immigration
an
evening
similar
in
purpose
to
the
one
devoted
to
the
italians
was
organized
for
the
germans
in
our
first
year
owing
to
the
superior
education
of
our
teutonic
guests
and
the
clever
leading
of
a
cultivated
german
woman
these
evenings
reflected
something
of
that
cozy
social
intercourse
which
is
found
in
its
perfection
in
the
fatherland
our
guests
sang
a
great
deal
in
the
tender
minor
of
the
german
folksong
or
in
the
rousing
spirit
of
the
rhine
and
they
slowly
but
persistently
pursued
a
course
in
german
history
and
literature
recovering
something
of
that
poetry
and
romance
which
they
had
long
since
resigned
with
other
good
things
we
found
strong
family
affection
between
them
and
their
children
but
their
pleasures
were
not
in
common
and
they
seldom
went
out
together
perhaps
the
greatest
value
of
the
settlement
to
them
was
in
placing
large
and
pleasant
rooms
with
musical
facilities
at
their
disposal
and
in
reviving
their
almost
forgotten
enthusiams
i
have
seen
sons
and
daughters
stand
in
complete
surprise
as
their
mother
knitting
needles
softly
beat
time
to
the
song
she
was
singing
or
her
worn
face
turned
rosy
under
the
as
she
made
an
curtsy
at
the
end
of
a
german
poem
it
was
easy
to
fancy
a
growing
touch
of
respect
in
her
children
manner
to
her
and
a
rising
enthusiasm
for
german
literature
and
reminiscence
on
the
part
of
all
the
family
an
effort
to
bring
together
the
old
life
and
the
new
a
respect
for
the
older
cultivation
and
not
quite
so
much
assurance
that
the
new
was
the
best
this
tendency
upon
the
part
of
the
older
immigrants
to
lose
the
amenities
of
european
life
without
sharing
those
of
america
has
often
been
deplored
by
keen
observers
from
the
home
countries
when
professor
masurek
of
prague
gave
a
course
of
lectures
in
the
university
of
chicago
he
was
much
distressed
over
the
materialism
into
which
the
bohemians
of
chicago
had
fallen
the
early
immigrants
had
been
so
stirred
by
the
opportunity
to
own
real
estate
an
appeal
perhaps
to
the
slavic
land
hunger
and
their
energies
had
become
so
completely
absorbed
in
that
all
other
interests
had
apparently
dropped
away
and
yet
i
recall
a
very
touching
incident
in
connection
with
a
lecture
professor
masurek
gave
at
in
which
he
had
appealed
to
his
countrymen
to
arouse
themselves
from
this
tendency
to
fall
below
their
home
civilization
and
to
forget
the
great
enthusiasm
which
had
united
them
into
the
movement
a
bohemian
widow
who
supported
herself
and
her
two
children
by
scrubbing
hastily
sent
her
youngest
child
to
purchase
with
the
cents
which
was
to
have
supplied
them
with
food
the
next
day
a
bunch
of
red
roses
which
she
presented
to
the
lecturer
in
appreciation
of
his
testimony
to
the
reality
of
the
things
of
the
spirit
an
overmastering
desire
to
reveal
the
humbler
immigrant
parents
to
their
own
children
lay
at
the
base
of
what
has
come
to
be
called
the
labor
museum
this
was
first
suggested
to
my
mind
one
early
spring
day
when
i
saw
an
old
italian
woman
her
distaff
against
her
homesick
face
patiently
spinning
a
thread
by
the
simple
stick
spindle
so
reminiscent
of
all
southern
europe
i
was
walking
down
polk
street
perturbed
in
spirit
because
it
seemed
so
difficult
to
come
into
genuine
relations
with
the
italian
women
and
because
they
themselves
so
often
lost
their
hold
upon
their
americanized
children
it
seemed
to
me
that
ought
to
be
able
to
devise
some
educational
enterprise
which
should
build
a
bridge
between
european
and
american
experiences
in
such
wise
as
to
give
them
both
more
meaning
and
a
sense
of
relation
i
meditated
that
perhaps
the
power
to
see
life
as
a
whole
is
more
needed
in
the
immigrant
quarter
of
a
large
city
than
anywhere
else
and
that
the
lack
of
this
power
is
the
most
fruitful
source
of
misunderstanding
between
european
immigrants
and
their
children
as
it
is
between
them
and
their
american
neighbors
and
why
should
that
chasm
between
fathers
and
sons
yawning
at
the
feet
of
each
generation
be
made
so
unnecessarily
cruel
and
impassable
to
these
bewildered
immigrants
suddenly
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
old
woman
with
her
distaff
sitting
in
the
sun
on
the
steps
of
a
tenement
house
she
might
have
served
as
a
model
for
one
of
michelangelo
fates
but
her
face
brightened
as
i
passed
and
holding
up
her
spindle
for
me
to
see
she
called
out
that
when
she
had
spun
a
little
more
yarn
she
would
knit
a
pair
of
stockings
for
her
goddaughter
the
occupation
of
the
old
woman
gave
me
the
clue
that
was
needed
could
we
not
interest
the
young
people
working
in
the
neighborhood
factories
in
these
older
forms
of
industry
so
that
through
their
own
parents
and
grandparents
they
would
find
a
dramatic
representation
of
the
inherited
resources
of
their
daily
occupation
if
these
young
people
could
actually
see
that
the
complicated
machinery
of
the
factory
had
been
evolved
from
simple
tools
they
might
at
least
make
a
beginning
toward
that
education
which
dewey
defines
as
a
continuing
reconstruction
of
experience
they
might
also
lay
a
foundation
for
reverence
of
the
past
which
goethe
declares
to
be
the
basis
of
all
sound
progress
my
exciting
walk
on
polk
street
was
followed
by
many
talks
with
dewey
and
with
one
of
the
teachers
in
his
school
who
was
a
resident
at
within
a
month
a
room
was
fitted
up
to
which
we
might
invite
those
of
our
neighbors
who
were
possessed
of
old
crafts
and
who
were
eager
to
use
them
we
found
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
at
least
four
varieties
of
these
most
primitive
methods
of
spinning
and
three
distinct
variations
of
the
same
spindle
in
connection
with
wheels
it
was
possible
to
put
these
seven
into
historic
sequence
and
order
and
to
connect
the
whole
with
the
present
method
of
factory
spinning
the
same
thing
was
done
for
weaving
and
on
every
saturday
evening
a
little
exhibit
was
made
of
these
various
forms
of
labor
in
the
textile
industry
within
one
room
a
syrian
woman
a
greek
an
italian
a
russian
and
an
irishwoman
enabled
even
the
most
casual
observer
to
see
that
there
is
no
break
in
orderly
evolution
if
we
look
at
history
from
the
industrial
standpoint
that
industry
develops
similarly
and
peacefully
year
by
year
among
the
workers
of
each
nation
heedless
of
differences
in
language
religion
and
political
experiences
and
then
we
grew
ambitious
and
arranged
lectures
upon
industrial
history
i
remember
that
after
an
interesting
lecture
upon
the
industrial
revolution
in
england
and
a
portrayal
of
the
appalling
conditions
throughout
the
weaving
districts
of
the
north
which
resulted
from
the
hasty
gathering
of
the
weavers
into
the
new
towns
a
russian
tailor
in
the
audience
was
moved
to
make
a
speech
he
suggested
that
whereas
time
had
done
much
to
alleviate
the
first
difficulties
in
the
transition
of
weaving
from
hand
work
to
steam
power
that
in
the
application
of
steam
to
sewing
we
are
still
in
our
first
stages
illustrated
by
the
isolated
woman
who
tries
to
support
herself
by
hand
needlework
at
home
until
driven
out
by
starvation
as
many
of
the
hand
weavers
had
been
the
historical
analogy
seemed
to
bring
a
certain
comfort
to
the
tailor
as
did
a
chart
upon
the
wall
showing
the
infinitesimal
amount
of
time
that
steam
had
been
applied
to
manufacturing
processes
compared
to
the
centuries
of
hand
labor
human
progress
is
slow
and
perhaps
never
more
cruel
than
in
the
advance
of
industry
but
is
not
the
worker
comforted
by
knowing
that
other
historical
periods
have
existed
similar
to
the
one
in
which
he
finds
himself
and
that
the
readjustment
may
be
shortened
and
alleviated
by
judicious
action
and
is
he
not
entitled
to
the
solace
which
an
artistic
portrayal
of
the
situation
might
give
him
i
remember
the
evening
of
the
tailor
speech
that
i
felt
reproached
because
no
poet
or
artist
has
endeared
the
victim
to
us
as
george
eliot
has
made
us
love
the
belated
weaver
silas
marner
the
textile
museum
is
connected
directly
with
the
basket
weaving
sewing
millinery
embroidery
and
dressmaking
constantly
being
taught
at
and
so
far
as
possible
with
the
other
educational
departments
we
have
also
been
able
to
make
a
collection
of
products
of
early
implements
and
of
photographs
which
are
full
of
suggestion
yet
far
beyond
its
direct
educational
value
we
prize
it
because
it
so
often
puts
the
immigrants
into
the
position
of
teachers
and
we
imagine
that
it
affords
them
a
pleasant
change
from
the
tutelage
in
which
all
americans
including
their
own
children
are
so
apt
to
hold
them
i
recall
a
number
of
russian
women
working
in
a
sewing
room
near
who
heard
one
christmas
week
that
the
house
was
going
to
give
a
party
to
which
they
might
come
they
arrived
one
afternoon
when
unfortunately
there
was
no
party
on
hand
and
although
the
residents
did
their
best
to
entertain
them
with
impromptu
music
and
refreshments
it
was
quite
evident
that
they
were
greatly
disappointed
finally
it
was
suggested
that
they
be
shown
the
labor
museum
where
gradually
the
thirty
sodden
tired
women
were
transformed
they
knew
how
to
use
the
spindles
and
were
delighted
to
find
the
russian
spinning
frame
many
of
them
had
never
seen
the
spinning
wheel
which
has
not
penetrated
to
certain
parts
of
russia
and
they
regarded
it
as
a
new
and
wonderful
invention
they
turned
up
their
dresses
to
show
their
homespun
petticoats
they
tried
the
looms
they
explained
the
difficulty
of
the
old
patterns
in
short
from
having
been
stupidly
entertained
they
themselves
did
the
entertaining
because
of
a
direct
appeal
to
former
experiences
the
immigrant
visitors
were
able
for
the
moment
to
instruct
their
american
hostesses
in
an
old
and
honored
craft
as
was
indeed
becoming
to
their
age
and
experience
in
some
such
ways
as
these
have
the
labor
museum
and
the
shops
pointed
out
the
possibilities
which
has
scarcely
begun
to
develop
of
demonstrating
that
culture
is
an
understanding
of
the
occupations
and
thoughts
of
men
of
the
arts
with
which
they
have
solaced
their
toil
a
yearning
to
recover
for
the
household
arts
something
of
their
early
sanctity
and
meaning
arose
strongly
within
me
one
evening
when
i
was
attending
a
passover
feast
to
which
i
had
been
invited
by
a
jewish
family
in
the
neighborhood
where
the
traditional
and
religious
significance
of
the
woman
daily
activity
was
still
retained
the
kosher
food
the
jewish
mother
spread
before
her
family
had
been
prepared
according
to
traditional
knowledge
and
with
constant
care
in
the
use
of
utensils
upon
her
had
fallen
the
responsibility
to
make
all
ready
according
to
mosaic
instructions
that
the
great
crisis
in
a
religious
history
might
be
fittingly
set
forth
by
her
husband
and
son
aside
from
the
grave
religious
significance
in
the
ceremony
my
mind
was
filled
with
shifting
pictures
of
woman
labor
with
which
travel
makes
one
familiar
the
indian
women
grinding
grain
outside
of
their
huts
as
they
sing
praises
to
the
sun
and
rain
a
file
of
moorish
women
whom
i
had
once
seen
waiting
their
turn
at
a
well
in
tangiers
south
italian
women
kneeling
in
a
row
along
the
stream
and
beating
their
wet
clothes
against
the
smooth
white
stones
the
milking
the
gardening
the
marketing
in
thousands
of
hamlets
which
are
such
direct
expressions
of
the
solicitude
and
affection
at
the
basis
of
all
family
life
there
has
been
some
testimony
that
the
labor
museum
has
revealed
the
charm
of
woman
primitive
activities
i
recall
a
certain
italian
girl
who
came
every
saturday
evening
to
a
cooking
class
in
the
same
building
in
which
her
mother
spun
in
the
labor
museum
exhibit
and
yet
angelina
always
left
her
mother
at
the
front
door
while
she
herself
went
around
to
a
side
door
because
she
did
not
wish
to
be
too
closely
identified
in
the
eyes
of
the
rest
of
the
cooking
class
with
an
italian
woman
who
wore
a
kerchief
over
her
head
uncouth
boots
and
short
petticoats
one
evening
however
angelina
saw
her
mother
surrounded
by
a
group
of
visitors
from
the
school
of
education
who
much
admired
the
spinning
and
she
concluded
from
their
conversation
that
her
mother
was
the
best
spinner
in
america
when
she
inquired
from
me
as
to
the
truth
of
this
deduction
i
took
occasion
to
describe
the
italian
village
in
which
her
mother
had
lived
something
of
her
free
life
and
how
because
of
the
opportunity
she
and
the
other
women
of
the
village
had
to
drop
their
spindles
over
the
edge
of
a
precipice
they
had
developed
a
skill
in
spinning
beyond
that
of
the
neighboring
towns
i
dilated
somewhat
on
the
freedom
and
beauty
of
that
life
how
hard
it
must
be
to
exchange
it
all
for
a
tenement
and
to
give
up
a
beautiful
homespun
kerchief
for
an
ugly
department
store
hat
i
intimated
it
was
most
unfair
to
judge
her
by
these
things
alone
and
that
while
she
must
depend
on
her
daughter
to
learn
the
new
ways
she
also
had
a
right
to
expect
her
daughter
to
know
something
of
the
old
ways
that
which
i
could
not
convey
to
the
child
but
upon
which
my
own
mind
persistently
dwelt
was
that
her
mother
whole
life
had
been
spent
in
a
secluded
spot
under
the
rule
of
traditional
and
narrowly
localized
observances
until
her
very
religion
clung
to
local
sanctities
to
the
shrine
before
which
she
had
always
prayed
to
the
pavement
and
walls
of
the
low
vaulted
church
and
then
suddenly
she
was
torn
from
it
all
and
literally
put
out
to
sea
straight
away
from
the
solid
habits
of
her
religious
and
domestic
life
and
she
now
walked
timidly
but
with
poignant
sensibility
upon
a
new
and
strange
shore
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
thought
of
her
mother
with
any
other
background
than
that
of
the
tenement
was
new
to
angelina
and
at
least
two
things
resulted
she
allowed
her
mother
to
pull
out
of
the
big
box
under
the
bed
the
beautiful
homespun
garments
which
had
been
previously
hidden
away
as
uncouth
and
she
openly
came
into
the
labor
museum
by
the
same
door
as
did
her
mother
proud
at
least
of
the
mastery
of
the
craft
which
had
been
so
much
admired
a
club
of
necktie
workers
formerly
meeting
at
persistently
resented
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
their
director
to
improve
their
minds
the
president
once
said
that
she
would
be
caught
dead
at
a
lecture
that
she
came
to
the
club
to
get
some
fun
out
of
it
and
indeed
it
was
most
natural
that
she
should
crave
recreation
after
a
hard
day
work
one
evening
i
saw
the
entire
club
listening
to
quite
a
stiff
lecture
in
the
labor
museum
and
to
my
rather
wicked
remark
to
the
president
that
i
was
surprised
to
see
her
enjoying
a
lecture
she
replied
that
she
did
not
call
this
a
lecture
she
called
this
getting
next
to
the
stuff
you
work
with
all
the
time
it
was
perhaps
the
sincerest
tribute
we
have
ever
received
as
to
the
success
of
the
undertaking
the
labor
museum
continually
demanded
more
space
as
it
was
enriched
by
a
fine
textile
exhibit
lent
by
the
field
museum
and
later
by
carefully
selected
specimens
of
basketry
from
the
philippines
the
shops
have
finally
included
a
group
of
three
or
four
women
irish
italian
danish
who
have
become
a
permanent
working
force
in
the
textile
department
which
has
developed
into
a
industry
through
the
sale
of
its
homespun
products
these
women
and
a
few
men
who
come
to
the
museum
to
utilize
their
european
skill
in
pottery
metal
and
wood
demonstrate
that
immigrant
colonies
might
yield
to
our
american
life
something
very
valuable
if
their
resources
were
intelligently
studied
and
developed
i
recall
an
italian
who
had
decorated
the
doorposts
of
his
tenement
with
a
beautiful
pattern
he
had
previously
used
in
carving
the
reredos
of
a
neapolitan
church
who
was
fired
by
his
landlord
on
the
ground
of
destroying
property
his
feelings
were
hurt
not
so
much
that
he
had
been
put
out
of
his
house
as
that
his
work
had
been
so
disregarded
and
he
said
that
when
people
traveled
in
italy
they
liked
to
look
at
wood
carvings
but
that
in
america
they
only
made
money
out
of
you
sometimes
the
suppression
of
the
instinct
of
workmanship
is
followed
by
more
disastrous
results
a
bohemian
whose
little
girl
attended
classes
at
in
one
of
his
periodic
drunken
spells
had
literally
almost
choked
her
to
death
and
later
had
committed
suicide
when
in
delirium
tremens
his
poor
wife
who
stayed
a
week
at
after
the
disaster
until
a
new
tenement
could
be
arranged
for
her
one
day
showed
me
a
gold
ring
which
her
husband
had
made
for
their
betrothal
it
exhibited
the
most
exquisite
workmanship
and
she
said
that
although
in
the
old
country
he
had
been
a
goldsmith
in
america
he
had
for
twenty
years
shoveled
coal
in
a
furnace
room
of
a
large
manufacturing
plant
that
whenever
she
saw
one
of
his
restless
fits
which
preceded
his
drunken
periods
coming
on
if
she
could
provide
him
with
a
bit
of
metal
and
persuade
him
to
stay
at
home
and
work
at
it
he
was
all
right
and
the
time
passed
without
disaster
but
that
nothing
else
would
do
it
this
story
threw
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
dead
man
struggle
and
on
the
stupid
maladjustment
which
had
broken
him
down
why
had
we
never
been
told
why
had
our
interest
in
the
remarkable
musical
ability
of
his
child
blinded
us
to
the
hidden
artistic
ability
of
the
father
we
had
forgotten
that
a
occupation
may
form
the
very
foundations
of
the
moral
life
that
the
art
with
which
a
man
has
solaced
his
toil
may
be
the
salvation
of
his
uncertain
temperament
there
are
many
examples
of
touching
fidelity
to
immigrant
parents
on
the
part
of
their
grown
children
a
young
man
who
day
after
day
attends
ceremonies
which
no
longer
express
his
religious
convictions
and
who
makes
his
vain
effort
to
interest
his
russian
jewish
father
in
social
problems
a
daughter
who
might
earn
much
more
money
as
a
stenographer
could
she
work
from
monday
morning
till
saturday
night
but
who
quietly
and
docilely
makes
neckties
for
low
wages
because
she
can
thus
abstain
from
work
saturdays
to
please
her
father
these
young
people
like
poor
maggie
tulliver
through
many
painful
experiences
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
pity
memory
and
faithfulness
are
natural
ties
with
paramount
claims
this
faithfulness
however
is
sometimes
ruthlessly
imposed
upon
by
immigrant
parents
who
eager
for
money
and
accustomed
to
the
patriarchal
authority
of
peasant
households
hold
their
children
in
a
stern
bondage
which
requires
a
surrender
of
all
their
wages
and
concedes
no
time
or
money
for
pleasures
there
are
many
convincing
illustrations
that
this
parental
harshness
often
results
in
juvenile
delinquency
a
polish
boy
of
seventeen
came
to
one
day
to
ask
a
contribution
of
fifty
cents
towards
a
flower
piece
for
the
funeral
of
an
old
club
boy
a
few
questions
made
it
clear
that
the
object
was
fictitious
whereupon
the
boy
broke
down
and
stated
that
he
wanted
to
buy
two
cent
tickets
one
for
his
girl
and
one
for
himself
to
a
dance
of
the
benevolent
social
twos
that
he
had
a
penny
of
his
own
although
he
had
worked
in
a
brass
foundry
for
three
years
and
had
been
advanced
twice
because
he
always
had
to
give
his
pay
envelope
unopened
to
his
father
just
look
at
the
clothes
he
buys
me
was
his
concluding
remark
perhaps
the
girls
are
held
even
more
rigidly
in
a
recent
investigation
of
two
hundred
working
girls
it
was
found
that
only
five
per
cent
had
the
use
of
their
own
money
and
that
per
cent
turned
in
all
they
earned
literally
every
penny
to
their
mothers
it
was
through
this
little
investigation
that
we
first
knew
marcella
a
pretty
young
german
girl
who
helped
her
widowed
mother
year
after
year
to
care
for
a
large
family
of
younger
children
she
was
content
for
the
most
part
although
her
mother
notions
of
dress
gave
her
but
an
infinitesimal
amount
of
her
own
wages
to
spend
on
her
clothes
and
she
was
quite
sophisticated
as
to
proper
dressing
because
she
sold
silk
in
a
neighborhood
department
store
her
mother
approved
of
the
young
man
who
was
showing
her
various
attentions
and
agreed
that
marcella
should
accept
his
invitation
to
a
ball
but
would
allow
her
not
a
penny
toward
a
new
gown
to
replace
one
impossibly
plain
and
shabby
marcella
spent
a
sleepless
night
and
wept
bitterly
although
she
well
knew
that
the
doctor
bill
for
the
children
scarlet
fever
was
not
yet
paid
the
next
day
as
she
was
cutting
off
three
yards
of
shining
pink
silk
the
thought
came
to
her
that
it
would
make
her
a
fine
new
waist
to
wear
to
the
ball
she
wistfully
saw
it
wrapped
in
paper
and
carelessly
stuffed
into
the
muff
of
the
purchaser
when
suddenly
the
parcel
fell
upon
the
floor
no
one
was
looking
and
quick
as
a
flash
the
girl
picked
it
up
and
pushed
it
into
her
blouse
the
theft
was
discovered
by
the
relentless
department
store
detective
who
for
the
sake
of
example
insisted
upon
taking
the
case
into
court
the
poor
mother
wept
bitter
tears
over
this
downfall
of
her
frommes
madchen
and
no
one
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
of
her
own
blindness
i
know
a
polish
boy
whose
earnings
were
all
given
to
his
father
who
gruffly
refused
all
requests
for
pocket
money
one
christmas
his
little
sisters
having
been
told
by
their
mother
that
they
were
too
poor
to
have
any
christmas
presents
appealed
to
the
big
brother
as
to
one
who
was
earning
money
of
his
own
flattered
by
the
implication
but
at
the
same
time
quite
impecunious
the
night
before
christmas
he
nonchalantly
walked
through
a
neighboring
department
store
and
stole
a
manicure
set
for
one
little
sister
and
a
string
of

was
caught
at
the
door
by
the
house
detective
as
one
of
those
children
whom
each
local
department
store
arrests
in
the
weeks
before
christmas
at
the
daily
rate
of
eight
to
twenty
the
youngest
of
these
offenders
are
seldom
taken
into
court
but
are
either
sent
home
with
a
warning
or
turned
over
to
the
officers
of
the
juvenile
protective
association
most
of
these
premature
law
breakers
are
in
search
of
americanized
clothing
and
others
are
only
looking
for
playthings
they
are
all
distracted
by
the
profusion
and
variety
of
the
display
and
their
moral
sense
is
confused
by
the
general
air
of
openhandedness
these
disastrous
efforts
are
not
unlike
those
of
many
younger
children
who
are
constantly
arrested
for
petty
thieving
because
they
are
too
eager
to
take
home
food
or
fuel
which
will
relieve
the
distress
and
need
they
so
constantly
hear
discussed
the
coal
on
the
wagons
the
vegetables
displayed
in
front
of
the
grocery
shops
the
very
wooden
blocks
in
the
loosened
street
paving
are
a
challenge
to
their
powers
to
help
out
at
home
a
bohemian
boy
who
was
out
on
parole
from
the
old
detention
home
of
the
juvenile
court
itself
brought
back
five
stolen
chickens
to
the
matron
for
sunday
dinner
saying
that
he
knew
the
committee
were
having
a
hard
time
to
fill
up
so
many
kids
and
perhaps
these
fowl
would
help
out
the
honest
immigrant
parents
totally
ignorant
of
american
laws
and
municipal
regulations
often
send
a
child
to
pick
up
coal
on
the
railroad
tracks
or
to
stand
at
three
in
the
morning
before
the
side
door
of
a
restaurant
which
gives
away
broken
food
or
to
collect
grain
for
the
chickens
at
the
base
of
elevators
and
standing
cars
the
latter
custom
accounts
for
the
large
number
of
boys
arrested
for
breaking
the
seals
on
grain
freight
cars
it
is
easy
for
a
child
thus
trained
to
accept
the
proposition
of
a
junk
dealer
to
bring
him
bars
of
iron
stored
in
freight
yards
four
boys
quite
recently
had
thus
carried
away
and
sold
to
one
man
two
tons
of
iron
four
fifths
of
the
children
brought
into
the
juvenile
court
in
chicago
are
the
children
of
foreigners
the
germans
are
the
greatest
offenders
polish
next
do
their
children
suffer
from
the
excess
of
virtue
in
those
parents
so
eager
to
own
a
house
and
lot
one
often
sees
a
grasping
parent
in
the
court
utterly
broken
down
when
the
americanized
youth
who
has
been
brought
to
grief
clings
as
piteously
to
his
peasant
father
as
if
he
were
still
a
frightened
little
boy
in
the
steerage
many
of
these
children
have
come
to
grief
through
their
premature
fling
into
city
life
having
thrown
off
parental
control
as
they
have
impatiently
discarded
foreign
ways
boys
of
ten
and
twelve
will
refuse
to
sleep
at
home
preferring
the
freedom
of
an
old
brewery
vault
or
an
empty
warehouse
to
the
obedience
required
by
their
parents
and
for
days
these
boys
will
live
on
the
milk
and
bread
which
they
steal
from
the
back
porches
after
the
early
morning
delivery
such
children
complain
that
there
is
no
fun
at
home
one
little
chap
who
was
given
a
vacant
lot
to
cultivate
by
the
city
garden
association
insisted
upon
raising
only
popcorn
and
tried
to
present
the
entire
crop
to
to
be
used
for
the
parties
with
the
stipulation
that
he
would
have
to
be
invited
every
single
time
then
there
are
little
groups
of
dissipated
young
men
who
pride
themselves
upon
their
ability
to
live
without
working
and
who
despise
all
the
honest
and
sober
ways
of
their
immigrant
parents
they
are
at
once
a
menace
and
a
center
of
demoralization
certainly
the
bewildered
parents
unable
to
speak
english
and
ignorant
of
the
city
whose
children
have
disappeared
for
days
or
weeks
have
often
come
to
evincing
that
agony
which
fairly
separates
the
marrow
from
the
bone
as
if
they
had
discovered
a
new
type
of
suffering
devoid
of
the
healing
in
familiar
sorrows
it
is
as
if
they
did
not
know
how
to
search
for
the
children
without
the
assistance
of
the
children
themselves
perhaps
the
most
pathetic
aspect
of
such
cases
is
their
revelation
of
the
premature
dependence
of
the
older
and
wiser
upon
the
young
and
foolish
which
is
in
itself
often
responsible
for
the
situation
because
it
has
given
the
children
an
undue
sense
of
their
own
importance
and
a
false
security
that
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
on
the
other
hand
an
italian
girl
who
has
had
lessons
in
cooking
at
the
public
school
will
help
her
mother
to
connect
the
entire
family
with
american
food
and
household
habits
that
the
mother
has
never
baked
bread
in
italy
only
mixed
it
in
her
own
house
and
then
taken
it
out
to
the
village
oven
makes
all
the
more
valuable
her
daughter
understanding
of
the
complicated
cooking
stove
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
girl
who
learns
to
sew
in
the
public
school
and
more
than
anything
else
perhaps
of
the
girl
who
receives
the
first
simple
instruction
in
the
care
of
little
children
that
skillful
care
which
every
baby
requires
if
he
is
to
be
pulled
through
his
second
summer
as
a
result
of
this
teaching
i
recall
a
young
girl
who
carefully
explained
to
her
italian
mother
that
the
reason
the
babies
in
italy
were
so
healthy
and
the
babies
in
chicago
were
so
sickly
was
not
as
her
mother
had
firmly
insisted
because
her
babies
in
italy
had
goat
milk
and
her
babies
in
america
had
cow
milk
but
because
the
milk
in
italy
was
clean
and
the
milk
in
chicago
was
dirty
she
said
that
when
you
milked
your
own
goat
before
the
door
you
knew
that
the
milk
was
clean
but
when
you
bought
milk
from
the
grocery
store
after
it
had
been
carried
for
many
miles
in
the
country
you
could
tell
whether
it
was
fit
for
the
baby
to
drink
until
the
men
from
the
city
hall
who
had
watched
it
all
the
way
said
that
it
was
all
right
thus
through
civic
instruction
in
the
public
schools
the
italian
woman
slowly
became
urbanized
in
the
sense
in
which
the
word
was
used
by
her
own
latin
ancestors
and
thus
the
habits
of
her
entire
family
were
modified
the
public
schools
in
the
immigrant
colonies
deserve
all
the
praise
as
americanizing
agencies
which
can
be
bestowed
upon
them
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
curriculum
in
the
direction
of
the
experiments
will
react
more
directly
upon
such
households
it
is
difficult
to
write
of
the
relation
of
the
older
and
most
immigrants
to
the
children
of
other
people
the
italians
whose
are
upset
simply
because
they
are
dagoes
or
the
russian
peddlers
who
are
stoned
and
sometimes
badly
injured
because
it
has
become
a
code
of
honor
in
a
gang
of
boys
to
thus
express
their
derision
the
members
of
a
protective
association
of
jewish
peddlers
organized
at
related
daily
experiences
in
which
old
age
had
been
treated
with
such
irreverence
cherished
dignity
with
such
disrespect
that
a
listener
caught
the
passion
of
lear
in
the
old
texts
as
a
platitude
enunciated
by
a
man
who
discovers
in
it
his
own
experience
thrills
us
as
no
unfamiliar
phrases
can
possibly
do
the
greeks
are
filled
with
amazed
rage
when
their
very
name
is
flung
at
them
as
an
opprobrious
epithet
doubtless
these
difficulties
would
be
much
minimized
in
america
if
we
faced
our
own
race
problem
with
courage
and
intelligence
and
these
very
mediterranean
immigrants
might
give
us
valuable
help
certainly
they
are
less
conscious
than
the
of
color
distinctions
perhaps
because
of
their
traditional
familiarity
with
carthage
and
egypt
they
listened
with
respect
and
enthusiasm
to
a
scholarly
address
delivered
by
professor
du
bois
at
on
a
lincoln
birthday
with
apparently
no
consciousness
of
that
race
difference
which
color
seems
to
accentuate
so
absurdly
and
upon
my
return
from
various
conferences
held
in
the
interest
of
the
advancement
of
colored
people
i
have
had
many
illuminating
conversations
with
my
cosmopolitan
neighbors
the
celebration
of
national
events
has
always
been
a
source
of
new
understanding
and
companionship
with
the
members
of
the
contiguous
foreign
colonies
not
only
between
them
and
their
american
neighbors
but
between
them
and
their
own
children
one
of
our
earliest
italian
events
was
a
rousing
commemoration
of
garibaldi
birthday
and
his
imposing
bust
presented
to
that
evening
was
long
the
chief
ornament
of
our
front
hall
it
called
forth
great
enthusiasm
from
the
connazionali
whom
ruskin
calls
not
the
common
people
of
italy
but
the
companion
people
because
of
their
power
for
swift
sympathy
a
huge
hellenic
meeting
held
at
in
which
the
achievements
of
the
classic
period
were
set
forth
both
in
greek
and
english
by
scholars
of
repute
brought
us
into
a
new
sense
of
fellowship
with
all
our
greek
neighbors
as
the
mayor
of
chicago
was
seated
upon
the
right
hand
of
the
dignified
senior
priest
of
the
greek
church
and
they
were
greeted
alternately
in
the
national
hymns
of
america
and
greece
one
felt
a
curious
sense
of
the
possibility
of
transplanting
to
new
and
crude
chicago
some
of
the
traditions
of
athens
itself
so
deeply
cherished
in
the
hearts
of
this
group
of
citizens
the
greeks
indeed
gravely
consider
their
traditions
as
their
most
precious
possession
and
more
than
once
in
meetings
of
protest
held
by
the
greek
colony
against
the
aggressions
of
the
bulgarians
in
macedonia
i
have
heard
it
urged
that
the
bulgarians
are
trying
to
establish
a
protectorate
not
only
for
their
immediate
advantage
but
that
they
may
claim
a
glorious
history
for
the
barbarous
country
it
is
said
that
on
the
basis
of
this
protectorate
they
are
already
teaching
in
their
schools
that
alexander
the
great
was
a
bulgarian
and
that
it
will
be
but
a
short
time
before
they
claim
aristotle
himself
an
indignity
the
greeks
will
never
suffer
to
me
personally
the
celebration
of
the
hundredth
anniversary
of
mazzini
birth
was
a
matter
of
great
interest
throughout
the
world
that
day
italians
who
believed
in
a
united
italy
came
together
they
recalled
the
hopes
of
this
man
who
with
all
his
devotion
to
his
country
was
still
more
devoted
to
humanity
and
who
dedicated
to
the
workingmen
of
italy
an
appeal
so
philosophical
so
filled
with
a
yearning
for
righteousness
that
it
transcended
all
national
boundaries
and
became
a
bugle
call
for
the
duties
of
man
a
copy
of
this
document
was
given
to
every
school
child
in
the
public
schools
of
italy
on
this
one
hundredth
anniversary
and
as
the
chicago
branch
of
the
society
of
young
italy
marched
into
our
largest
hall
and
presented
to
an
heroic
bust
of
mazzini
i
found
myself
devoutly
hoping
that
the
italian
youth
who
have
committed
their
future
to
america
might
indeed
become
the
apostles
of
the
fraternity
of
nations
and
that
our
american
citizenship
might
be
built
without
disturbing
these
foundations
which
were
laid
of
old
time

tolstoyism
the
administration
of
charity
in
chicago
during
the
winter
following
the
world
fair
had
been
of
necessity
most
difficult
for
although
large
sums
had
been
given
to
the
temporary
relief
organization
which
endeavored
to
care
for
the
thousands
of
destitute
strangers
stranded
in
the
city
we
all
worked
under
a
sense
of
desperate
need
and
a
paralyzing
consciousness
that
our
best
efforts
were
most
inadequate
to
the
situation
during
the
many
relief
visits
i
paid
that
winter
in
tenement
houses
and
miserable
lodgings
i
was
constantly
shadowed
by
a
certain
sense
of
shame
that
i
should
be
comfortable
in
the
midst
of
such
distress
this
resulted
at
times
in
a
curious
reaction
against
all
the
educational
and
philanthropic
activities
in
which
i
had
been
engaged
in
the
face
of
the
desperate
hunger
and
need
these
could
not
but
seem
futile
and
superficial
the
hard
winter
in
chicago
had
turned
the
thoughts
of
many
of
us
to
these
stern
matters
a
young
friend
of
mine
who
came
daily
to
consulted
me
in
regard
to
going
into
the
paper
warehouse
belonging
to
her
father
that
she
might
there
sort
rags
with
the
polish
girls
another
young
girl
took
a
place
in
a
sweatshop
for
a
month
doing
her
work
so
simply
and
thoroughly
that
the
proprietor
had
no
notion
that
she
had
not
been
driven
there
by
need
still
two
others
worked
in
a
shoe
factory
and
all
this
happened
before
such
adventures
were
undertaken
in
order
to
procure
literary
material
it
was
in
the
following
winter
that
the
pioneer
effort
in
this
direction
walter
account
of
his
vain
attempt
to
find
work
in
chicago
compelled
even
the
sternest
businessman
to
drop
his
assertion
that
any
man
can
find
work
if
he
wants
it
the
dealing
directly
with
the
simplest
human
wants
may
have
been
responsible
for
an
impression
which
i
carried
about
with
me
almost
constantly
for
a
period
of
two
years
and
which
culminated
finally
in
a
visit
to
tolstoy
that
the
settlement
or
at
least
was
a
mere
pretense
and
travesty
of
the
simple
impulse
to
live
with
the
poor
so
long
as
the
residents
did
not
share
the
common
lot
of
hard
labor
and
scant
fare
actual
experience
had
left
me
in
much
the
same
state
of
mind
i
had
been
in
after
reading
tolstoy
what
to
do
which
is
a
description
of
his
futile
efforts
to
relieve
the
unspeakable
distress
and
want
in
the
moscow
winter
of
and
his
inevitable
conviction
that
only
he
who
literally
shares
his
own
shelter
and
food
with
the
needy
can
claim
to
have
served
them
doubtless
it
is
much
easier
to
see
what
to
do
in
rural
russia
where
all
the
conditions
tend
to
make
the
contrast
as
broad
as
possible
between
peasant
labor
and
noble
idleness
than
it
is
to
see
what
to
do
in
the
interdependencies
of
the
modern
industrial
city
but
for
that
very
reason
perhaps
clear
statement
is
valuable
for
that
type
of
conscientious
person
in
every
land
who
finds
it
hard
not
only
to
walk
in
the
path
of
righteousness
but
to
discover
where
the
path
lies
i
had
read
the
books
of
tolstoy
steadily
all
the
years
since
my
religion
had
come
into
my
hands
immediately
after
i
left
college
the
reading
of
that
book
had
made
clear
that
men
poor
little
efforts
to
do
right
are
put
forth
for
the
most
part
in
the
chill
of
i
became
convinced
that
if
the
new
social
order
ever
came
it
would
come
by
gathering
to
itself
all
the
pathetic
human
endeavor
which
had
indicated
the
forward
direction
but
i
was
most
eager
to
know
whether
undertaking
to
do
his
daily
share
of
the
physical
labor
of
the
world
that
labor
which
is
so
disproportionate
to
the
unnourished
strength
of
those
by
whom
it
is
ordinarily
performed
had
brought
him
peace
i
had
time
to
review
carefully
many
things
in
my
mind
during
the
long
days
of
convalescence
following
an
illness
of
typhoid
fever
which
i
suffered
in
the
autumn
of
the
illness
was
so
prolonged
that
my
health
was
most
unsatisfactory
during
the
following
winter
and
the
next
may
i
went
abroad
with
my
friend
miss
smith
to
effect
if
possible
a
more
complete
recovery
the
prospect
of
seeing
tolstoy
filled
me
with
the
hope
of
finding
a
clue
to
the
tangled
affairs
of
city
poverty
i
was
but
one
of
thousands
of
our
contemporaries
who
were
turning
toward
this
russian
not
as
to
a
seer
his
message
is
much
too
confused
and
contradictory
for
that
but
as
to
a
man
who
has
had
the
ability
to
lift
his
life
to
the
level
of
his
conscience
to
translate
his
theories
into
action
our
first
few
weeks
in
england
were
most
stimulating
a
dozen
years
ago
london
still
showed
traces
of
that
exciting
moment
in
the
life
of
the
nation
when
its
youth
is
casting
about
for
new
enthusiasms
but
it
evinced
still
more
of
that
british
capacity
to
perform
the
hard
work
of
careful
research
and
which
must
precede
any
successful
experiments
in
social
reform
of
the
varied
groups
and
individuals
whose
suggestions
remained
with
me
for
years
i
recall
perhaps
as
foremost
those
members
of
the
new
london
county
council
whose
plans
for
the
betterment
of
london
could
not
but
enkindle
enthusiasm
it
was
a
most
striking
expression
of
that
effort
which
would
place
beside
the
refinement
and
pleasure
of
the
rich
a
new
refinement
and
a
new
pleasure
born
of
the
commonwealth
and
the
common
joy
of
all
the
citizens
that
at
this
moment
they
prized
the
municipal
pleasure
boats
upon
the
thames
no
less
than
the
extensive
schemes
for
the
municipal
housing
of
the
poorest
people
ben
tillet
who
was
then
an
alderman
the
docker
sitting
beside
the
duke
took
me
in
a
rowboat
down
the
thames
on
a
journey
made
exciting
by
the
hundreds
of
dockers
who
cheered
him
as
we
passed
one
wharf
after
another
on
our
way
to
his
home
at
greenwich
john
burns
showed
us
his
wonderful
civic
accomplishments
at
battersea
the
plant
turning
street
sweepings
into
cement
pavements
the
technical
school
teaching
boys
brick
laying
and
plumbing
and
the
public
bath
in
which
the
children
of
the
board
school
were
receiving
a
swimming
lesson
these
measures
anticipating
our
achievements
in
chicago
by
at
least
a
decade
and
a
half
the
new
education
bill
which
was
destined
to
drag
on
for
twelve
years
before
it
developed
into
the
children
charter
was
then
a
storm
center
in
the
house
of
commons
miss
smith
and
i
were
much
pleased
to
be
taken
to
tea
on
the
parliament
terrace
by
its
author
sir
john
gorst
although
we
were
quite
bewildered
by
the
arguments
we
heard
there
for
church
schools
versus
secular
we
heard
keir
hardie
before
a
large
audience
of
workingmen
standing
in
the
open
square
of
canning
town
outline
the
great
things
to
be
accomplished
by
the
then
new
labor
party
and
we
joined
the
vast
body
of
men
in
the
booming
hymn
when
wilt
thou
save
the
people
o
god
of
mercy
when
finding
it
hard
to
realize
that
we
were
attending
a
political
meeting
it
seemed
that
moment
as
if
the
hopes
of
democracy
were
more
likely
to
come
to
pass
on
english
soil
than
upon
our
own
robert
blatchford
stirring
pamphlets
were
in
everyone
hands
and
a
reception
given
by
karl
marx
daughter
aveling
to
liebknecht
before
he
returned
to
germany
to
serve
a
prison
term
for
his
lese
majeste
speech
in
the
reichstag
gave
us
a
glimpse
of
the
orthodox
socialist
who
had
not
yet
begun
to
yield
to
the
biting
ridicule
of
bernard
shaw
although
he
flamed
in
their
midst
that
evening
octavia
hill
kindly
demonstrated
to
us
the
principles
upon
which
her
business
of
rent
collecting
was
established
and
with
pardonable
pride
showed
us
the
red
cross
square
with
its
cottages
marvelously
picturesque
and
comfortable
on
two
sides
and
on
the
third
a
public
hall
and
common
drawing
room
for
the
use
of
all
the
tenants
the
interior
of
the
latter
had
been
decorated
by
pupils
of
walter
crane
with
mural
frescoes
portraying
the
heroism
in
the
life
of
the
modern
workingman
while
all
this
was
warmly
human
we
also
had
opportunities
to
see
something
of
a
group
of
men
and
women
who
were
approaching
the
social
problem
from
the
study
of
economics
among
others
and
sidney
webb
who
were
at
work
on
their
industrial
democracy
john
hobson
who
was
lecturing
on
the
evolution
of
modern
capitalism
we
followed
factory
inspectors
on
a
round
of
duties
performed
with
a
thoroughness
and
a
trained
intelligence
which
were
a
revelation
of
the
possibilities
of
public
service
when
it
came
to
visiting
settlements
we
were
at
least
reassured
that
they
were
not
falling
into
identical
lines
of
effort
canon
ingram
who
has
since
become
bishop
of
london
was
then
warden
of
oxford
house
and
in
the
midst
of
an
experiment
which
pleased
me
greatly
the
more
because
it
was
carried
on
by
a
churchman
oxford
house
had
hired
all
the
concert
halls
vaudeville
shows
we
later
called
them
in
chicago
which
were
found
in
bethnal
green
for
every
saturday
night
the
residents
had
censored
the
programs
which
they
were
careful
to
keep
popular
and
any
workingman
who
attended
a
show
in
bethnal
green
on
a
saturday
night
and
thousands
of
them
did
heard
a
program
the
better
for
this
effort
one
evening
in
university
hall
humphry
ward
who
had
just
returned
from
italy
described
the
effect
of
the
italian
salt
tax
in
a
talk
which
was
evidently
one
in
a
series
of
lectures
upon
the
economic
wrongs
which
pressed
heaviest
upon
the
poor
at
browning
house
at
the
moment
they
were
giving
prizes
to
those
of
their
costermonger
neighbors
who
could
present
the
best
donkeys
and
the
warden
herbert
stead
exhibited
almost
the
enthusiasm
of
his
brother
for
that
crop
of
kindliness
which
can
be
garnered
most
easily
from
the
acreage
where
human
beings
grow
the
thickest
at
the
bermondsey
settlement
they
were
rejoicing
that
their
university
extension
students
had
successfully
passed
the
examinations
for
the
university
of
london
the
entire
impression
received
in
england
of
research
of
scholarship
of
organized
public
spirit
was
in
marked
contrast
to
the
impressions
of
my
next
visit
in
when
the
south
african
war
had
absorbed
the
enthusiasm
of
the
nation
and
the
wrongs
at
the
heart
of
the
empire
were
disregarded
and
neglected
london
of
course
presented
sharp
differences
to
russia
where
social
conditions
were
written
in
black
and
white
with
little
shading
like
a
demonstration
of
the
chinese
proverb
where
one
man
lives
in
luxury
another
is
dying
of
hunger
the
fair
of
seemed
to
take
us
to
the
very
edge
of
civilization
so
remote
and
eastern
that
the
merchants
brought
their
curious
goods
upon
the
backs
of
camels
or
on
strange
craft
riding
at
anchor
on
the
broad
volga
but
even
here
our
letter
of
introduction
to
korolenko
the
novelist
brought
us
to
a
realization
of
that
strange
mingling
of
a
remote
past
and
a
present
which
russia
presents
on
every
hand
this
same
contrast
was
also
shown
by
the
pilgrims
trudging
on
pious
errands
to
monasteries
to
tombs
and
to
the
holy
land
itself
with
their
bleeding
feet
bound
in
rags
and
thrust
into
bast
sandals
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
revolutionists
even
then
advocating
a
republic
which
should
obtain
not
only
in
political
but
also
in
industrial
affairs
we
had
letters
of
introduction
to
and
aylmer
maude
of
moscow
since
well
known
as
the
translators
of
resurrection
and
other
of
tolstoy
later
works
who
at
that
moment
were
on
the
eve
of
leaving
russia
in
order
to
form
an
agricultural
colony
in
south
england
where
they
might
support
themselves
by
the
labor
of
their
hands
we
gladly
accepted
maude
offer
to
take
us
to
yasnaya
polyana
and
to
introduce
us
to
count
tolstoy
and
never
did
a
disciple
journey
toward
his
master
with
more
enthusiasm
than
did
our
guide
when
however
maude
actually
presented
miss
smith
and
myself
to
count
tolstoy
knowing
well
his
master
attitude
toward
philanthropy
he
endeavored
to
make
appear
much
more
noble
and
unique
than
i
should
have
ventured
to
do
tolstoy
standing
by
clad
in
his
peasant
garb
listened
gravely
but
glancing
distrustfully
at
the
sleeves
of
my
traveling
gown
which
unfortunately
at
that
season
were
monstrous
in
size
he
took
hold
of
an
edge
and
pulling
out
one
sleeve
to
an
interminable
breadth
said
quite
simply
that
there
was
enough
stuff
on
one
arm
to
make
a
frock
for
a
little
girl
and
asked
me
directly
if
i
did
not
find
such
a
dress
a
barrier
to
the
people
i
was
too
disconcerted
to
make
a
very
clear
explanation
although
i
tried
to
say
that
monstrous
as
my
sleeves
were
they
did
not
compare
in
size
with
those
of
the
working
girls
in
chicago
and
that
nothing
would
more
effectively
separate
me
from
the
people
than
a
cotton
blouse
following
the
simple
lines
of
the
human
form
even
if
i
had
wished
to
imitate
him
and
dress
as
a
peasant
it
would
have
been
hard
to
choose
which
peasant
among
the
nationalities
we
had
recently
counted
in
our
ward
fortunately
the
countess
came
to
my
rescue
with
a
recital
of
her
former
attempts
to
clothe
hypothetical
little
girls
in
yards
of
material
cut
from
a
train
and
other
superfluous
parts
of
her
best
gown
until
she
had
been
driven
to
a
firm
stand
which
she
advised
me
to
take
at
once
but
neither
countess
tolstoy
nor
any
other
friend
was
on
hand
to
help
me
out
of
my
predicament
later
when
i
was
asked
who
fed
me
and
how
did
i
obtain
shelter
upon
my
reply
that
a
farm
a
hundred
miles
from
chicago
supplied
me
with
the
necessities
of
life
i
fairly
anticipated
the
next
scathing
question
so
you
are
an
absentee
landlord
do
you
think
you
will
help
the
people
more
by
adding
yourself
to
the
crowded
city
than
you
would
by
tilling
your
own
soil
this
new
sense
of
discomfort
over
a
failure
to
till
my
own
soil
was
increased
when
tolstoy
second
daughter
appeared
at
the
tea
table
set
under
the
trees
coming
straight
from
the
harvest
field
where
she
had
been
working
with
a
group
of
peasants
since
five
in
the
morning
not
pretending
to
work
but
really
taking
the
place
of
a
peasant
woman
who
had
hurt
her
foot
she
was
plainly
much
exhausted
but
neither
expected
nor
received
sympathy
from
the
members
of
a
family
who
were
quite
accustomed
to
see
each
other
carry
out
their
convictions
in
spite
of
discomfort
and
fatigue
the
martyrdom
of
discomfort
however
was
obviously
much
easier
to
bear
than
that
to
which
even
to
the
eyes
of
the
casual
visitor
count
tolstoy
daily
subjected
himself
for
his
study
in
the
basement
of
the
conventional
dwelling
with
its
short
shelf
of
battered
books
and
its
scythe
and
spade
leaning
against
the
wall
had
many
times
lent
itself
to
that
ridicule
which
is
the
most
difficult
form
of
martyrdom
that
summer
evening
as
we
sat
in
the
garden
with
a
group
of
visitors
from
germany
from
england
and
america
who
had
traveled
to
the
remote
russian
village
that
they
might
learn
of
this
man
one
could
not
forbear
the
constant
inquiry
to
one
self
as
to
why
he
was
so
regarded
as
sage
and
saint
that
this
party
of
people
should
be
repeated
each
day
of
the
year
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
we
were
all
attracted
by
this
sermon
of
the
deed
because
tolstoy
had
made
the
one
supreme
personal
effort
one
might
almost
say
the
one
frantic
personal
effort
to
put
himself
into
right
relations
with
the
humblest
people
with
the
men
who
tilled
his
soil
blacked
his
boots
and
cleaned
his
stables
doubtless
the
heaviest
burden
of
our
contemporaries
is
a
consciousness
of
a
divergence
between
our
democratic
theory
on
the
one
hand
that
working
people
have
a
right
to
the
intellectual
resources
of
society
and
the
actual
fact
on
the
other
hand
that
thousands
of
them
are
so
overburdened
with
toil
that
there
is
no
leisure
nor
energy
left
for
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
we
constantly
suffer
from
the
strain
and
indecision
of
believing
this
theory
and
acting
as
if
we
did
not
believe
it
and
this
man
who
years
before
had
tried
to
get
off
the
backs
of
the
peasants
who
had
at
least
simplified
his
life
and
worked
with
his
hands
had
come
to
be
a
prototype
to
many
of
his
generation
doubtless
all
of
the
visitors
sitting
in
the
tolstoy
garden
that
evening
had
excused
themselves
from
laboring
with
their
hands
upon
the
theory
that
they
were
doing
something
more
valuable
for
society
in
other
ways
no
one
among
our
contemporaries
has
dissented
from
this
point
of
view
so
violently
as
tolstoy
himself
and
yet
no
man
might
so
easily
have
excused
himself
from
hard
and
rough
work
on
the
basis
of
his
genius
and
of
his
intellectual
contributions
to
the
world
so
far
however
from
considering
his
time
too
valuable
to
be
spent
in
labor
in
the
field
or
in
making
shoes
our
great
host
was
too
eager
to
know
life
to
be
willing
to
give
up
this
companionship
of
mutual
labor
one
instinctively
found
reasons
why
it
was
easier
for
a
russian
than
for
the
rest
of
us
to
reach
this
conclusion
the
russian
peasants
have
a
proverb
which
says
labor
is
the
house
that
love
lives
in
by
which
they
mean
that
no
two
people
nor
group
of
people
can
come
into
affectionate
relations
with
each
other
unless
they
carry
on
together
a
mutual
task
and
when
the
russian
peasant
talks
of
labor
he
means
labor
on
the
soil
or
to
use
the
phrase
of
the
great
peasant
bondereff
bread
labor
those
monastic
orders
founded
upon
agricultural
labor
those
philosophical
experiments
like
brook
farm
and
many
another
have
attempted
to
reduce
to
action
this
same
truth
tolstoy
himself
has
written
many
times
his
own
convictions
and
attempts
in
this
direction
perhaps
never
more
tellingly
than
in
the
description
of
lavin
morning
spent
in
the
harvest
field
when
he
lost
his
sense
of
grievance
and
isolation
and
felt
a
strange
new
brotherhood
for
the
peasants
in
proportion
as
the
rhythmic
motion
of
his
scythe
became
one
with
theirs
at
the
long
dinner
table
laid
in
the
garden
were
the
various
traveling
guests
the
daughters
and
the
younger
children
with
their
governess
the
countess
presided
over
the
usual
european
dinner
served
by
men
but
the
count
and
the
daughter
who
had
worked
all
day
in
the
fields
ate
only
porridge
and
black
bread
and
drank
only
kvas
the
fare
of
the
peasants
of
course
we
are
all
accustomed
to
the
fact
that
those
who
perform
the
heaviest
labor
eat
the
coarsest
and
simplest
fare
at
the
end
of
the
day
but
it
is
not
often
that
we
sit
at
the
same
table
with
them
while
we
ourselves
eat
the
more
elaborate
food
prepared
by
someone
else
labor
tolstoy
ate
his
simple
supper
without
remark
or
comment
upon
the
food
his
family
and
guests
preferred
to
eat
assuming
that
they
as
well
as
he
had
settled
the
matter
with
their
own
consciences
the
tolstoy
household
that
evening
was
much
interested
in
the
fate
of
a
young
russian
spy
who
had
recently
come
to
tolstoy
in
the
guise
of
a
country
schoolmaster
in
order
to
obtain
a
copy
of
life
which
had
been
interdicted
by
the
censor
of
the
press
after
spending
the
night
in
talk
with
tolstoy
the
spy
had
gone
away
with
a
copy
of
the
forbidden
manuscript
but
unfortunately
for
himself
having
become
converted
to
tolstoy
views
he
had
later
made
a
full
confession
to
the
authorities
and
had
been
exiled
to
siberia
tolstoy
holding
that
it
was
most
unjust
to
exile
the
disciple
while
he
the
author
of
the
book
remained
at
large
had
pointed
out
this
inconsistency
in
an
open
letter
to
one
of
the
moscow
newspapers
the
discussion
of
this
incident
of
course
opened
up
the
entire
subject
of
nonresidence
and
curiously
enough
i
was
disappointed
in
tolstoy
position
in
the
matter
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
made
too
great
a
distinction
between
the
use
of
physical
force
and
that
moral
energy
which
can
override
differences
and
scruples
with
equal
ruthlessness
with
that
inner
sense
of
mortification
with
which
one
finds
self
at
difference
with
the
great
authority
i
recalled
the
conviction
of
the
early
residents
that
whatever
of
good
the
settlement
had
to
offer
should
be
put
into
positive
terms
that
we
might
live
with
opposition
to
no
man
with
recognition
of
the
good
in
every
man
even
the
most
wretched
we
had
often
departed
from
this
principle
but
had
it
not
in
every
case
been
a
confession
of
weakness
and
had
we
not
always
found
antagonism
a
foolish
and
unwarrantable
expenditure
of
energy
the
conversation
at
dinner
and
afterward
although
conducted
with
animation
and
sincerity
for
the
moment
stirred
vague
misgivings
within
me
was
tolstoy
more
logical
than
life
warrants
could
the
wrongs
of
life
be
reduced
to
the
terms
of
unrequited
labor
and
all
be
made
right
if
each
person
performed
the
amount
necessary
to
satisfy
his
own
wants
was
it
not
always
easy
to
put
up
a
strong
case
if
one
took
the
naturalistic
view
of
life
but
what
about
the
historic
view
the
inevitable
shadings
and
modifications
which
life
itself
brings
to
its
own
interpretation
miss
smith
and
i
took
a
night
train
back
to
moscow
in
that
tumult
of
feeling
which
is
always
produced
by
contact
with
a
conscience
making
one
more
of
those
determined
efforts
to
probe
to
the
very
foundations
of
the
mysterious
world
in
which
we
find
ourselves
a
horde
of
perplexing
questions
concerning
those
problems
of
existence
of
which
in
happier
moments
we
catch
but
fleeting
glimpses
and
at
which
we
even
then
stand
aghast
pursued
us
relentlessly
on
the
long
journey
through
the
great
wheat
plains
of
south
russia
through
the
crowded
ghetto
of
warsaw
and
finally
into
the
smiling
fields
of
germany
where
the
peasant
men
and
women
were
harvesting
the
grain
i
remember
that
through
the
sight
of
those
toiling
peasants
i
made
a
curious
connection
between
the
bread
labor
advocated
by
tolstoy
and
the
comfort
the
harvest
fields
are
said
to
have
once
brought
to
luther
when
much
perturbed
by
many
theological
difficulties
he
suddenly
forgot
them
all
in
a
gush
of
gratitude
for
mere
bread
exclaiming
how
it
stands
that
golden
yellow
corn
on
its
fine
tapered
stem
the
meek
earth
at
kind
bidding
has
produced
it
once
again
at
least
the
toiling
poor
had
this
comfort
of
bread
labor
and
perhaps
it
did
not
matter
that
they
gained
it
unknowingly
and
painfully
if
only
they
walked
in
the
path
of
labor
in
the
exercise
of
that
curious
power
possessed
by
the
theorist
to
inhibit
all
experiences
which
do
not
enhance
his
doctrine
i
did
not
permit
myself
to
recall
that
which
i
knew
so
well
that
exigent
and
unremitting
labor
grants
the
poor
no
leisure
even
in
the
supreme
moments
of
human
suffering
and
that
all
griefs
are
lighter
with
bread
i
may
have
wished
to
secure
this
solace
for
myself
at
the
cost
of
the
least
possible
expenditure
of
time
and
energy
for
during
the
next
month
in
germany
when
i
read
everything
of
tolstoy
that
had
been
translated
into
english
german
or
french
there
grew
up
in
my
mind
a
conviction
that
what
i
ought
to
do
upon
my
return
to
was
to
spend
at
least
two
hours
every
morning
in
the
little
bakery
which
we
had
recently
added
to
the
equipment
of
our
coffeehouse
two
hours
work
would
be
but
a
wretched
compromise
but
it
was
hard
to
see
how
i
could
take
more
time
out
of
each
day
i
had
been
taught
to
bake
bread
in
my
childhood
not
only
as
a
household
accomplishment
but
because
my
father
true
to
his
miller
tradition
had
insisted
that
each
one
of
his
daughters
on
her
twelfth
birthday
must
present
him
with
a
satisfactory
wheat
loaf
of
her
own
baking
and
he
was
most
exigent
as
to
the
quality
of
this
test
loaf
what
could
be
more
in
keeping
with
my
training
and
tradition
than
baking
bread
i
did
not
quite
see
how
my
activity
would
fit
in
with
that
of
the
german
union
baker
who
presided
over
the
bakery
but
all
such
matters
were
secondary
and
certainly
could
be
arranged
it
may
be
that
i
had
thus
to
pacify
my
aroused
conscience
before
i
could
settle
down
to
hear
wagner
ring
at
beyreuth
it
may
be
that
i
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
phrase
bread
labor
but
at
any
rate
i
held
fast
to
the
belief
that
i
should
do
this
through
the
entire
journey
homeward
on
land
and
sea
until
i
actually
arrived
in
chicago
when
suddenly
the
whole
scheme
seemed
to
me
as
utterly
preposterous
as
it
doubtless
was
the
half
dozen
people
invariably
waiting
to
see
me
after
breakfast
the
piles
of
letters
to
be
opened
and
answered
the
demand
of
actual
and
pressing
wants
were
these
all
to
be
pushed
aside
and
asked
to
wait
while
i
saved
my
soul
by
two
hours
work
at
baking
bread
although
my
resolution
was
abandoned
this
may
be
the
best
place
to
record
the
efforts
of
more
doughty
souls
to
carry
out
conclusions
it
was
perhaps
inevitable
that
tolstoy
colonies
should
be
founded
although
tolstoy
himself
has
always
insisted
that
each
man
should
live
his
life
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
place
in
which
he
was
born
the
visit
miss
smith
and
i
made
a
year
or
two
later
to
a
colony
in
one
of
the
southern
states
portrayed
for
us
most
vividly
both
the
weakness
and
the
strange
august
dignity
of
the
tolstoy
position
the
colonists
at
commonwealth
held
but
a
short
creed
they
claimed
in
fact
that
the
difficulty
is
not
to
state
truth
but
to
make
moral
conviction
operative
upon
actual
life
and
they
announced
it
their
intention
to
obey
the
teachings
of
jesus
in
all
matters
of
labor
and
the
use
of
property
they
would
thus
transfer
the
vindication
of
creed
from
the
church
to
the
open
field
from
dogma
to
experience
the
day
miss
smith
and
i
visited
the
commonwealth
colony
of
threescore
souls
they
were
erecting
a
house
for
the
family
of
a
man
consisting
of
a
wife
and
nine
children
who
had
come
the
week
before
in
a
forlorn
prairie
schooner
from
arkansas
as
this
was
the
largest
family
the
little
colony
contained
the
new
house
was
to
be
the
largest
yet
erected
upon
our
surprise
at
this
literal
giving
to
him
that
asketh
we
inquired
if
the
policy
of
extending
food
and
shelter
to
all
who
applied
without
test
of
creed
or
ability
might
not
result
in
the
migration
of
all
the
neighboring
poorhouse
population
into
the
colony
we
were
told
that
this
actually
had
happened
during
the
winter
until
the
colony
fare
of
corn
meal
and
cow
peas
had
proved
so
unattractive
that
the
paupers
had
gone
back
for
even
the
poorest
of
the
southern
poorhouses
occasionally
supplied
bacon
with
the
pone
if
only
to
prevent
scurvy
from
which
the
colonists
themselves
had
suffered
the
difficulty
of
the
poorhouse
people
had
thus
settled
itself
by
the
sheer
poverty
of
the
situation
a
poverty
so
biting
that
the
only
ones
willing
to
face
it
were
those
sustained
by
a
conviction
of
its
righteousness
the
fields
and
gardens
were
being
worked
by
an
editor
a
professor
a
clergyman
as
well
as
by
artisans
and
laborers
the
fruit
thereof
to
be
eaten
by
themselves
and
their
families
or
by
any
other
families
who
might
arrive
from
arkansas
the
colonists
were
very
conventional
in
matters
of
family
relationship
and
had
broken
with
society
only
in
regard
to
the
conventions
pertaining
to
labor
and
property
we
had
a
curious
experience
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
we
were
driven
into
the
nearest
town
we
had
taken
with
us
as
a
guest
the
wife
of
the
president
of
the
colony
wishing
to
give
her
a
dinner
at
the
hotel
because
she
had
girlishly
exclaimed
during
a
conversation
that
at
times
during
the
winter
she
had
become
so
eager
to
hear
good
music
that
it
had
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
actually
hungry
for
it
almost
as
hungry
as
she
was
for
a
beefsteak
yet
as
we
drove
away
we
had
the
curious
sensation
that
while
the
experiment
was
obviously
coming
to
an
end
in
the
midst
of
its
privations
it
yet
embodied
the
peace
of
mind
which
comes
to
him
who
insists
upon
the
logic
of
life
whether
it
is
reasonable
or
not
the
fanatic
joy
in
seeing
his
own
formula
translated
into
action
at
any
rate
as
we
reached
the
southern
town
of
workaday
men
and
women
for
one
moment
its
substantial
buildings
its
solid
brick
churches
its
ordered
streets
divided
into
those
of
the
rich
and
those
of
the
poor
seemed
much
more
unreal
to
us
than
the
little
struggling
colony
we
had
left
behind
we
repeated
to
each
other
that
in
all
the
practical
judgments
and
decisions
of
life
we
must
part
company
with
logical
demonstration
that
if
we
stop
for
it
in
each
case
we
can
never
go
on
at
all
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
when
conscience
does
become
the
dictator
of
the
daily
life
of
a
group
of
men
it
forces
our
admiration
as
no
other
modern
spectacle
has
power
to
do
it
seemed
but
a
mere
incident
that
this
group
should
have
lost
sight
of
the
facts
of
life
in
their
earnest
endeavor
to
put
to
the
test
the
things
of
the
spirit
i
knew
little
about
the
colony
started
by
maude
at
purleigh
containing
several
of
tolstoy
followers
who
were
not
permitted
to
live
in
russia
and
we
did
not
see
maude
again
until
he
came
to
chicago
on
his
way
from
manitoba
whither
he
had
transported
the
second
group
of
dukhobors
a
religious
sect
who
had
interested
all
of
tolstoy
followers
because
of
their
literal
acceptance
of
and
other
christian
doctrines
which
are
so
strenuously
advocated
by
tolstoy
it
was
for
their
benefit
that
tolstoy
had
finished
and
published
resurrection
breaking
through
his
resolution
against
novel
writing
after
the
dukhobors
were
settled
in
canada
of
the
five
hundred
dollars
left
from
the
resurrection
funds
one
half
was
given
to
it
seemed
possible
to
spend
this
fund
only
for
the
relief
of
the
most
primitive
wants
of
food
and
shelter
on
the
part
of
the
most
needy
families

public
activities
and
investigations
one
of
the
striking
features
of
our
neighborhood
twenty
years
ago
and
one
to
which
we
never
became
reconciled
was
the
presence
of
huge
wooden
garbage
boxes
fastened
to
the
street
pavement
in
which
the
undisturbed
refuse
accumulated
day
by
day
the
system
of
garbage
collecting
was
inadequate
throughout
the
city
but
it
became
the
greatest
menace
in
a
ward
such
as
ours
where
the
normal
amount
of
waste
was
much
increased
by
the
decayed
fruit
and
vegetables
discarded
by
the
italian
and
greek
fruit
peddlers
and
by
the
residuum
left
over
from
the
piles
of
filthy
rags
which
were
fished
out
of
the
city
dumps
and
brought
to
the
homes
of
the
rag
pickers
for
further
sorting
and
washing
the
children
of
our
neighborhood
twenty
years
ago
played
their
games
in
and
around
these
huge
garbage
boxes
they
were
the
first
objects
that
the
toddling
child
learned
to
climb
their
bulk
afforded
a
barricade
and
their
contents
provided
missiles
in
all
the
battles
of
the
older
boys
and
finally
they
became
the
seats
upon
which
absorbed
lovers
held
enchanted
converse
we
are
obliged
to
remember
that
all
children
eat
everything
which
they
find
and
that
odors
have
a
curious
and
intimate
power
of
entwining
themselves
into
our
tenderest
memories
before
even
the
residents
of
can
understand
their
own
early
enthusiasm
for
the
removal
of
these
boxes
and
the
establishment
of
a
better
system
of
refuse
collection
it
is
easy
for
even
the
most
conscientious
citizen
of
chicago
to
forget
the
foul
smells
of
the
stockyards
and
the
garbage
dumps
when
he
is
living
so
far
from
them
that
he
is
only
occasionally
made
conscious
of
their
existence
but
the
residents
of
a
settlement
are
perforce
constantly
surrounded
by
them
during
our
first
three
years
on
halsted
street
we
had
established
a
small
incinerator
at
and
we
had
many
times
reported
the
untoward
conditions
of
the
ward
to
the
city
hall
we
had
also
arranged
many
talks
for
the
immigrants
pointing
out
that
although
a
woman
may
sweep
her
own
doorway
in
her
native
village
and
allow
the
reuse
to
innocently
decay
in
the
open
air
and
sunshine
in
a
crowded
city
quarter
if
the
garbage
is
not
properly
collected
and
destroyed
a
mother
may
see
her
children
sicken
and
die
and
that
the
immigrants
must
therefore
not
only
keep
their
own
houses
clean
but
must
also
help
the
authorities
to
keep
the
city
clean
possibly
our
efforts
slightly
modified
the
worst
conditions
but
they
still
remained
intolerable
and
the
fourth
summer
the
situation
became
for
me
absolutely
desperate
when
i
realized
in
a
moment
of
panic
that
my
delicate
little
nephew
for
whom
i
was
guardian
could
not
be
with
me
at
at
all
unless
the
sickening
odors
were
reduced
i
may
well
be
ashamed
that
other
delicate
children
who
were
torn
from
their
families
not
into
boarding
school
but
into
eternity
had
not
long
before
driven
me
to
effective
action
under
the
direction
of
the
first
man
who
came
as
a
resident
to
we
began
a
systematic
investigation
of
the
city
system
of
garbage
collection
both
as
to
its
efficiency
in
other
wards
and
its
possible
connection
with
the
death
rate
in
the
various
wards
of
the
city
the
woman
club
had
been
organized
the
year
before
by
the
resident
kindergartner
who
had
first
inaugurated
a
meeting
the
new
members
came
together
however
in
quite
a
new
way
that
summer
when
we
discussed
with
them
the
high
death
rate
so
persistent
in
our
ward
after
several
club
meetings
devoted
to
the
subject
despite
the
fact
that
the
death
rate
rose
highest
in
the
congested
foreign
colonies
and
not
in
the
streets
in
which
most
of
the
irish
american
club
women
lived
twelve
of
their
number
undertook
in
connection
with
the
residents
to
carefully
investigate
the
conditions
of
the
alleys
during
august
and
september
the
substantiated
reports
of
violations
of
the
law
sent
in
from
to
the
health
department
were
one
thousand
and
for
the
club
woman
who
had
finished
a
long
work
of
washing
or
ironing
followed
by
the
cooking
of
a
hot
supper
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
sit
on
her
doorstep
during
a
summer
evening
than
to
go
up
and
down
alleys
and
get
into
trouble
with
her
neighbors
over
the
condition
of
their
garbage
boxes
it
required
both
civic
enterprise
and
moral
conviction
to
be
willing
to
do
this
three
evenings
a
week
during
the
hottest
and
most
uncomfortable
months
of
the
year
nevertheless
a
certain
number
of
women
persisted
as
did
the
residents
and
three
city
inspectors
in
succession
were
transferred
from
the
ward
because
of
unsatisfactory
services
still
the
death
rate
remained
high
and
the
condition
seemed
little
improved
throughout
the
next
winter
in
sheer
desperation
the
following
spring
when
the
city
contracts
were
awarded
for
the
removal
of
garbage
with
the
backing
of
two
business
men
i
put
in
a
bid
for
the
garbage
removal
of
the
nineteenth
ward
my
paper
was
thrown
out
on
a
technicality
but
the
incident
induced
the
mayor
to
appoint
me
the
garbage
inspector
of
the
ward
the
salary
was
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
the
loss
of
that
political
plum
made
a
great
stir
among
the
politicians
the
position
was
no
sinecure
whether
regarded
from
the
point
of
view
of
getting
up
at
six
in
the
morning
to
see
that
the
men
were
early
at
work
or
of
following
the
loaded
wagons
uneasily
dropping
their
contents
at
intervals
to
their
dreary
destination
at
the
dump
or
of
insisting
that
the
contractor
must
increase
the
number
of
his
wagons
from
nine
to
thirteen
and
from
thirteen
to
seventeen
although
he
assured
me
that
he
lost
money
on
every
one
and
that
the
former
inspector
had
let
him
off
with
seven
or
of
taking
careless
landlords
into
court
because
they
would
not
provide
the
proper
garbage
receptacles
or
of
arresting
the
tenant
who
tried
to
make
the
garbage
wagons
carry
away
the
contents
of
his
stable
with
the
two
or
three
residents
who
nobly
stood
by
we
set
up
six
of
those
doleful
incinerators
which
are
supposed
to
burn
garbage
with
the
fuel
collected
in
the
alley
itself
the
one
factory
in
town
which
could
utilize
old
tin
cans
was
a
window
weight
factory
and
we
deluged
that
with
ten
times
as
many
tin
cans
as
it
could
use
much
less
would
pay
for
we
made
desperate
attempts
to
have
the
dead
animals
removed
by
the
contractor
who
was
paid
most
liberally
by
the
city
for
that
purpose
but
who
we
slowly
discovered
always
made
the
police
ambulances
do
the
work
delivering
the
carcasses
upon
freight
cars
for
shipment
to
a
soap
factory
in
indiana
where
they
were
sold
for
a
good
price
although
the
contractor
himself
was
the
largest
stockholder
in
the
concern
perhaps
our
greatest
achievement
was
the
discovery
of
a
pavement
eighteen
inches
under
the
surface
in
a
narrow
street
although
after
it
was
found
we
triumphantly
discovered
a
record
of
its
existence
in
the
city
archives
the
italians
living
on
the
street
were
much
interested
but
displayed
little
astonishment
perhaps
because
they
were
accustomed
to
see
buried
cities
exhumed
this
pavement
became
the
casus
belli
between
myself
and
the
street
commissioner
when
i
insisted
that
its
restoration
belonged
to
him
after
i
had
removed
the
first
eight
inches
of
garbage
the
matter
was
finally
settled
by
the
mayor
himself
who
permitted
me
to
drive
him
to
the
entrance
of
the
street
in
what
the
children
called
my
garbage
phaeton
and
who
took
my
side
of
the
controversy
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
who
had
done
some
excellent
volunteer
inspection
in
both
chicago
and
pittsburg
became
my
deputy
and
performed
the
work
in
a
most
thoroughgoing
manner
for
three
years
during
the
last
two
she
was
under
the
regime
of
civil
service
for
in
to
the
great
joy
of
many
citizens
the
illinois
legislature
made
that
possible
many
of
the
women
of
the
ward
were
much
shocked
by
this
abrupt
departure
into
the
ways
of
men
and
it
took
a
great
deal
of
explanation
to
convey
the
idea
even
remotely
that
if
it
were
a
womanly
task
to
go
about
in
tenement
houses
in
order
to
nurse
the
sick
it
might
be
quite
as
womanly
to
go
through
the
same
district
in
order
to
prevent
the
breeding
of
filth
diseases
while
some
of
the
women
enthusiastically
approved
the
slowly
changing
conditions
and
saw
that
their
housewifely
duties
logically
extended
to
the
adjacent
alleys
and
streets
they
yet
were
quite
certain
that
it
was
not
a
job
a
revelation
of
this
attitude
was
made
one
day
in
a
conversation
which
the
inspector
heard
vigorously
carried
on
in
a
laundry
one
of
the
employees
was
leaving
and
was
expressing
her
mind
concerning
the
place
in
no
measured
terms
summing
up
her
contempt
for
it
as
follows
i
would
rather
be
the
girl
who
goes
about
in
the
alleys
than
to
stay
here
any
longer
and
yet
the
spectacle
of
eight
hours
work
for
eight
hours
pay
the
justice
to
all
citizens
irrespective
of
pull
the
dividing
of
responsibility
between
landlord
and
tenant
and
the
readiness
to
enforce
obedience
to
law
from
both
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
valuable
demonstrations
which
could
have
been
made
such
daily
living
on
the
part
of
the
office
holder
is
of
infinitely
more
value
than
many
talks
on
civics
for
after
all
we
credit
most
easily
that
which
we
see
the
careful
inspection
combined
with
other
causes
brought
about
a
great
improvement
in
the
cleanliness
and
comfort
of
the
neighborhood
and
one
happy
day
when
the
death
rate
of
our
ward
was
found
to
have
dropped
from
third
to
seventh
in
the
list
of
city
wards
and
was
so
reported
to
our
woman
club
the
applause
which
followed
recorded
the
genuine
sense
of
participation
in
the
result
and
a
public
spirit
which
had
made
good
but
the
cleanliness
of
the
ward
was
becoming
much
too
popular
to
suit
our
alderman
and
although
we
felt
fatuously
secure
under
the
regime
of
civil
service
he
found
a
way
to
circumvent
us
by
eliminating
the
position
altogether
he
introduced
an
ordinance
into
the
city
council
which
combined
the
collection
of
refuse
with
the
cleaning
and
repairing
of
the
streets
the
whole
to
be
placed
under
a
ward
superintendent
the
office
of
course
was
to
be
filled
under
civil
service
regulations
but
only
men
were
eligible
to
the
examination
although
this
latter
regulation
was
afterwards
modified
in
favor
of
one
woman
it
was
retained
long
enough
to
put
the
nineteenth
ward
inspector
out
of
office
of
course
our
experience
in
inspecting
only
made
us
more
conscious
of
the
wretched
housing
conditions
over
which
we
had
been
distressed
from
the
first
it
was
during
the
world
fair
summer
that
one
of
the
residents
in
a
public
address
upon
housing
reform
used
as
an
example
of
indifferent
landlordism
a
large
block
in
the
neighborhood
occupied
by
small
tenements
and
stables
unconnected
with
a
street
sewer
as
was
much
similar
property
in
the
vicinity
in
the
lecture
the
resident
spared
neither
a
description
of
the
property
nor
the
name
of
the
owner
the
young
man
who
owned
the
property
was
justly
indignant
at
this
public
method
of
attack
and
promptly
came
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
property
together
we
made
a
careful
tour
of
the
houses
and
stables
and
in
the
face
of
the
conditions
that
we
found
there
i
could
not
but
agree
with
him
that
supplying
south
italian
peasants
with
sanitary
appliances
seemed
a
difficult
undertaking
nevertheless
he
was
unwilling
that
the
block
should
remain
in
its
deplorable
state
and
he
finally
cut
through
the
dilemma
with
the
rash
proposition
that
he
would
give
a
free
lease
of
the
entire
tract
to
accompanying
the
offer
however
with
the
warning
remark
that
if
we
should
choose
to
use
the
income
from
the
rents
in
sanitary
improvements
we
should
be
throwing
our
money
away
even
when
we
decided
that
the
houses
were
so
bad
that
we
could
not
undertake
the
task
of
improving
them
he
was
game
and
stuck
to
his
proposition
that
we
should
have
a
free
lease
we
finally
submitted
a
plan
that
the
houses
should
be
torn
down
and
the
entire
tract
turned
into
a
playground
although
cautious
advisers
intimated
that
it
would
be
very
inconsistent
to
ask
for
subscriptions
for
the
support
of
when
we
were
known
to
have
thrown
away
an
income
of
two
thousand
dollars
a
year
we
however
felt
that
a
spectacle
of
inconsistency
was
better
than
one
of
bad
landlordism
and
so
the
worst
of
the
houses
were
demolished
the
best
three
were
sold
and
moved
across
the
street
under
careful
provision
that
they
might
never
be
used
for
shops
or
saloons
and
a
public
playground
was
finally
established
became
responsible
for
its
management
for
ten
years
at
the
end
of
which
time
it
was
turned
over
to
the
city
playground
commission
although
from
the
first
the
city
detailed
a
policeman
who
was
responsible
for
its
general
order
and
who
became
a
valued
adjunct
of
the
house
during
fifteen
years
this
owner
of
the
property
paid
all
the
taxes
and
when
the
block
was
finally
sold
he
made
possible
the
playground
equipment
of
a
schoolyard
on
the
other
hand
the
dispossessed
tenants
a
group
of
whom
had
to
be
evicted
by
legal
process
before
their
houses
could
be
torn
down
have
never
ceased
to
mourn
their
former
estates
only
the
other
day
i
met
upon
the
street
an
old
italian
harness
maker
who
said
that
he
had
never
succeeded
so
well
anywhere
else
nor
found
a
place
that
seemed
so
much
like
italy
festivities
of
various
sorts
were
held
on
this
early
playground
always
a
may
day
celebration
with
its
maypole
dance
and
its
may
queen
i
remember
that
one
year
that
honor
of
being
queen
was
offered
to
the
little
girl
who
should
pick
up
the
largest
number
of
scraps
of
paper
which
littered
all
the
streets
and
alleys
the
children
that
spring
had
been
organized
into
a
league
and
each
member
had
been
provided
with
a
stiff
piece
of
wire
upon
the
sharpened
point
of
which
stray
bits
of
paper
were
impaled
and
later
soberly
counted
off
into
a
large
box
in
the
alley
the
little
italian
girl
who
thus
won
the
scepter
took
it
very
gravely
as
the
just
reward
of
hard
labor
and
we
were
all
so
absorbed
in
the
desire
for
clean
and
tidy
streets
that
we
were
wholly
oblivious
to
the
incongruity
of
thus
selecting
the
queen
of
love
and
beauty
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
that
we
received
a
visit
from
the
warden
of
toynbee
hall
and
his
wife
as
they
were
returning
to
england
from
a
journey
around
the
world
they
had
lived
in
east
london
for
many
years
and
had
been
identified
with
the
public
movements
for
its
betterment
they
were
much
shocked
that
in
a
new
country
with
conditions
still
plastic
and
hopeful
so
little
attention
had
been
paid
to
experiments
and
methods
of
amelioration
which
had
already
been
tried
and
they
looked
in
vain
through
our
library
for
blue
books
and
governmental
reports
which
recorded
painstaking
study
into
the
conditions
of
english
cities
they
were
the
first
of
a
long
line
of
english
visitors
to
express
the
conviction
that
many
things
in
chicago
were
untoward
not
through
paucity
of
public
spirit
but
through
a
lack
of
political
machinery
adapted
to
modern
city
life
this
was
not
all
of
the
situation
but
perhaps
no
casual
visitor
could
be
expected
to
see
that
these
matters
of
detail
seemed
unimportant
to
a
city
in
the
first
flush
of
youth
impatient
of
correction
and
convinced
that
all
would
be
well
with
its
future
the
most
obvious
faults
were
those
connected
with
the
congested
housing
of
the
immigrant
population
nine
tenths
of
them
from
the
country
who
carried
on
all
sorts
of
traditional
activities
in
the
crowded
tenements
that
a
group
of
greeks
should
be
permitted
to
slaughter
sheep
in
a
basement
that
italian
women
should
be
allowed
to
sort
over
rags
collected
from
the
city
dumps
not
only
within
the
city
limits
but
in
a
court
swarming
with
little
children
that
immigrant
bakers
should
continue
unmolested
to
bake
bread
for
their
neighbors
in
unspeakably
filthy
spaces
under
the
pavement
appeared
incredible
to
visitors
accustomed
to
careful
city
regulations
i
recall
two
visits
made
to
the
italian
quarter
by
john
burns
the
second
thirteen
years
after
the
first
during
the
latter
visit
it
seemed
to
him
unbelievable
that
a
certain
house
owned
by
a
rich
italian
should
have
been
permitted
to
survive
he
remembered
with
the
greatest
minuteness
the
positions
of
the
houses
on
the
court
with
the
exact
space
between
the
front
and
rear
tenements
and
he
asked
at
once
whether
we
had
been
able
to
cut
a
window
into
a
dark
hall
as
he
had
recommended
thirteen
years
before
although
we
were
obliged
to
confess
that
the
landlord
would
not
permit
the
window
to
be
cut
we
were
able
to
report
that
a
city
homes
association
had
existed
for
ten
years
that
following
a
careful
study
of
tenement
conditions
in
chicago
the
text
of
which
had
been
written
by
a
resident
the
association
had
obtained
the
enactment
of
a
model
code
and
that
their
secretary
had
carefully
watched
the
administration
of
the
law
for
years
so
that
its
operation
might
not
be
minimized
by
the
granting
of
too
many
exceptions
in
the
city
council
our
progress
still
seemed
slow
to
burns
because
in
chicago
the
actual
houses
were
quite
unchanged
embodying
features
long
since
declared
illegal
in
london
only
this
year
could
we
have
reported
to
him
had
he
again
come
to
challenge
us
that
the
provisions
of
the
law
had
at
last
been
extended
to
existing
houses
and
that
a
conscientious
corps
of
inspectors
under
an
efficient
chief
were
fast
remedying
the
most
glaring
evils
while
a
band
of
nurses
and
doctors
were
following
hard
upon
the
trail
of
the
white
hearse
the
mere
consistent
enforcement
of
existing
laws
and
efforts
for
their
advance
often
placed
at
least
temporarily
into
strained
relations
with
its
neighbors
i
recall
a
continuous
warfare
against
local
landlords
who
would
move
wrecks
of
old
houses
as
a
nucleus
for
new
ones
in
order
to
evade
the
provisions
of
the
building
code
and
a
certain
italian
neighbor
who
was
filled
with
bitterness
because
his
new
rear
tenement
was
discovered
to
be
illegal
it
seemed
impossible
to
make
him
understand
that
the
health
of
the
tenants
was
in
any
wise
as
important
as
his
undisturbed
rents
nevertheless
many
evils
constantly
arise
in
chicago
from
congested
housing
which
wiser
cities
forestall
and
prevent
the
inevitable
boarders
crowded
into
a
dark
tenement
already
too
small
for
the
use
of
the
immigrant
family
occupying
it
the
surprisingly
large
number
of
delinquent
girls
who
have
become
criminally
involved
with
their
own
fathers
and
uncles
the
school
children
who
can
not
find
a
quiet
spot
in
which
to
read
or
study
and
who
perforce
go
into
the
streets
each
evening
the
tuberculosis
superinduced
and
fostered
by
the
inadequate
rooms
and
breathing
spaces
one
of
the
residents
under
the
direction
of
a
chicago
physician
who
stands
high
as
an
authority
on
tuberculosis
and
who
devotes
a
large
proportion
of
his
time
to
our
vicinity
made
an
investigation
into
housing
conditions
as
related
to
tuberculosis
with
a
result
as
startling
as
that
of
the
lung
block
in
new
york
it
is
these
subtle
evils
of
wretched
and
inadequate
housing
which
are
often
the
most
disastrous
in
the
summer
of
during
an
epidemic
of
typhoid
fever
in
which
our
ward
although
containing
but
one
of
the
population
of
the
city
registered
one
sixth
of
the
total
number
of
deaths
two
of
the
residents
made
an
investigation
of
the
methods
of
plumbing
in
the
houses
adjacent
to
conspicuous
groups
of
fever
cases
they
discovered
among
the
people
who
had
been
exposed
to
the
infection
a
widow
who
had
lived
in
the
ward
for
a
number
of
years
in
a
comfortable
little
house
of
her
own
although
the
italian
immigrants
were
closing
in
all
around
her
she
was
not
willing
to
sell
her
property
and
to
move
away
until
she
had
finished
the
education
of
her
children
in
the
meantime
she
held
herself
quite
aloof
from
her
italian
neighbors
and
could
never
be
drawn
into
any
of
the
public
efforts
to
secure
a
better
code
of
sanitation
her
two
daughters
were
sent
to
an
eastern
college
one
june
when
one
of
them
had
graduated
and
the
other
still
had
two
years
before
she
took
her
degree
they
came
to
the
spotless
little
house
and
their
mother
for
the
summer
holiday
they
both
fell
ill
with
typhoid
fever
and
one
daughter
died
because
the
mother
utmost
efforts
could
not
keep
the
infection
out
of
her
own
house
the
entire
disaster
affords
perhaps
a
fair
illustration
of
the
futility
of
the
individual
conscience
which
would
isolate
a
family
from
the
rest
of
the
community
and
its
interests
the
careful
information
collected
concerning
the
juxtaposition
of
the
typhoid
cases
to
the
various
systems
of
plumbing
and
nonplumbing
was
made
the
basis
of
a
bacteriological
study
by
another
resident
alice
hamilton
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
infection
having
been
carried
by
flies
her
researches
were
so
convincing
that
they
have
been
incorporated
into
the
body
of
scientific
data
supporting
that
theory
but
there
were
also
practical
results
from
the
investigation
it
was
discovered
that
the
wretched
sanitary
appliances
through
which
alone
the
infection
could
have
become
so
widely
spread
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
remain
unless
the
city
inspector
had
either
been
criminally
careless
or
open
to
the
arguments
of
favored
landlords
the
agitation
finally
resulted
in
a
long
and
stirring
trial
before
the
civil
service
board
of
half
of
the
employees
in
the
sanitary
bureau
with
the
final
discharge
of
eleven
out
of
the
entire
force
of
the
inspector
in
our
neighborhood
was
a
kindly
old
man
greatly
distressed
over
the
affair
and
quite
unable
to
understand
why
he
should
have
not
used
his
discretion
as
to
the
time
when
a
landlord
should
be
forced
to
put
in
modern
appliances
if
he
was
very
poor
or
just
about
to
sell
his
place
or
sure
that
the
house
would
be
torn
down
to
make
room
for
a
factory
why
should
one
inconvenience
him
the
old
man
died
soon
after
the
trial
feeling
persecuted
to
the
very
last
and
not
in
the
least
understanding
what
it
was
all
about
we
were
amazed
at
the
commercial
ramifications
which
graft
in
the
city
hall
involved
and
at
the
indignation
which
interference
with
it
produced
lost
some
large
subscriptions
as
the
result
of
this
investigation
a
loss
which
if
not
easy
to
bear
was
at
least
comprehensible
we
also
uncovered
unexpected
graft
in
connection
with
the
plumbers
unions
and
but
for
the
fearless
testimony
of
one
of
their
members
could
never
have
brought
the
trial
to
a
successful
issue
inevitable
misunderstanding
also
developed
in
connection
with
the
attempt
on
the
part
of
residents
to
prohibit
the
sale
of
cocaine
to
minors
which
brought
us
into
sharp
conflict
with
many
druggists
i
recall
an
italian
druggist
living
on
the
edge
of
the
neighborhood
who
finally
came
with
a
committee
of
his
countryman
to
see
what
wanted
of
him
thoroughly
convinced
that
no
such
effort
could
be
disinterested
one
dreary
trial
after
another
had
been
lost
through
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
legislation
and
after
many
attempts
to
secure
better
legal
regulation
of
its
sale
a
new
law
with
the
cooperation
of
many
agencies
was
finally
secured
in
through
all
this
the
italian
druggist
who
had
greatly
profited
by
the
sale
of
cocaine
to
boys
only
felt
outraged
and
abused
and
yet
the
thought
of
this
campaign
brings
before
my
mind
with
irresistible
force
a
young
italian
boy
who
died
a
victim
of
the
drug
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
had
been
in
our
kindergarten
as
a
handsome
merry
child
in
our
clubs
as
a
vivacious
boy
and
then
gradually
there
was
an
eclipse
of
all
that
was
animated
and
joyous
and
promising
and
when
i
at
last
saw
him
in
his
coffin
it
was
impossible
to
connect
that
haggard
shriveled
body
with
what
i
had
known
before
a
midwife
investigation
undertaken
in
connection
with
the
chicago
medical
society
while
showing
the
great
need
of
further
state
regulation
in
the
interest
of
the
most
ignorant
mothers
and
helpless
children
brought
us
into
conflict
with
one
of
the
most
venerable
of
all
customs
was
all
this
a
part
of
the
unending
struggle
between
the
old
and
new
or
were
these
oppositions
so
unexpected
and
so
unlooked
for
merely
a
reminder
of
that
old
bit
of
wisdom
that
there
is
no
guarding
against
interpretations
perhaps
more
subtle
still
they
were
due
to
that
very
of
disinterestedness
which
will
not
justify
itself
that
it
may
feel
superior
to
public
opinion
some
of
our
investigations
of
course
had
no
such
untoward
results
such
as
an
intensive
study
of
truancy
undertaken
by
a
resident
of
in
connection
with
the
compulsory
education
department
of
the
board
of
education
and
the
visiting
nurses
association
the
resident
britton
who
having
had
charge
of
our
children
clubs
for
many
years
knew
thousands
of
children
in
the
neighborhood
made
a
detailed
study
of
three
hundred
families
tracing
back
the
habitual
truancy
of
the
child
to
economic
and
social
causes
this
investigation
preceded
a
most
interesting
conference
on
truancy
held
under
a
committee
of
which
i
was
a
member
from
the
chicago
board
of
education
it
left
lasting
results
upon
the
administration
of
the
truancy
law
as
well
as
the
cooperation
of
volunteer
bodies
we
continually
conduct
small
but
careful
investigations
at
which
may
guide
us
in
our
immediate
doings
such
as
two
recently
undertaken
by
britton
one
upon
the
reading
of
school
children
before
new
books
were
bought
for
the
children
club
libraries
and
another
on
the
proportion
of
tuberculosis
among
school
children
before
we
opened
a
little
experimental
outdoor
school
on
one
of
our
balconies
some
of
the
investigations
are
purely
negative
in
result
we
once
made
an
attempt
to
test
the
fatigue
of
factory
girls
in
order
to
determine
how
far
overwork
superinduced
the
tuberculosis
to
which
such
a
surprising
number
of
them
were
victims
the
one
scientific
instrument
it
seemed
possible
to
use
was
an
ergograph
a
complicated
and
expensive
instrument
kindly
lent
to
us
from
the
physiological
laboratory
of
the
university
of
chicago
i
remember
the
imposing
procession
we
made
from
to
the
factory
full
of
working
women
in
which
the
proprietor
allowed
us
to
make
the
tests
first
there
was
the
precious
instrument
on
a
hand
truck
guarded
by
an
anxious
student
and
the
young
physician
who
was
going
to
take
the
tests
every
afternoon
then
there
was
hamilton
the
resident
in
charge
of
the
investigation
walking
with
a
scientist
who
was
interested
to
see
that
the
instrument
was
properly
installed
i
followed
in
the
rear
to
talk
once
more
to
the
proprietor
of
the
factory
to
be
quite
sure
that
he
would
permit
the
experiment
to
go
on
the
result
of
all
this
preparation
however
was
to
have
the
instrument
record
less
fatigue
at
the
end
of
the
day
than
at
the
beginning
not
because
the
girls
had
not
worked
hard
and
were
not
dog
tired
as
they
confessed
but
because
the
instrument
was
not
fitted
to
find
it
out
for
many
years
we
have
administered
a
branch
station
of
the
federal
post
office
at
which
we
applied
for
in
the
first
instance
because
our
neighbors
lost
such
a
large
percentage
of
the
money
they
sent
to
europe
through
the
commissions
to
middle
men
the
experience
in
the
post
office
constantly
gave
us
data
for
urging
the
establishment
of
postal
savings
as
we
saw
one
perplexed
immigrant
after
another
turning
away
in
bewilderment
when
he
was
told
that
the
united
states
post
office
did
not
receive
savings
we
find
increasingly
however
that
the
best
results
are
to
be
obtained
in
investigations
as
in
other
undertakings
by
combining
our
researches
with
those
of
other
public
bodies
or
with
the
state
itself
when
all
the
chicago
settlements
found
themselves
distressed
over
the
condition
of
the
newsboys
who
because
they
are
merchants
and
not
employees
do
not
come
under
the
provisions
of
the
illinois
child
labor
law
they
united
in
the
investigation
of
a
thousand
young
newsboys
who
were
all
interviewed
on
the
streets
during
the
same
hours
their
school
and
domestic
status
was
easily
determined
later
for
many
of
the
boys
lived
in
the
immediate
neighborhoods
of
the
ten
settlements
which
had
undertaken
the
investigation
the
report
embodying
the
results
of
the
investigation
recommended
a
city
ordinance
containing
features
from
the
boston
and
buffalo
regulations
and
although
an
ordinance
was
drawn
up
and
a
strenuous
effort
was
made
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
aldermen
none
of
them
would
introduce
it
into
the
city
council
without
newspaper
backing
we
were
able
to
agitate
for
it
again
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
national
child
labor
committee
which
was
held
in
chicago
in
and
which
was
of
course
reported
in
papers
throughout
the
entire
country
this
meeting
also
demonstrated
that
local
measures
can
sometimes
be
urged
most
effectively
when
joined
to
the
efforts
of
a
national
body
undoubtedly
the
best
discussions
ever
held
upon
the
operation
and
status
of
the
illinois
law
were
those
which
took
place
then
the
needs
of
the
illinois
children
were
regarded
in
connection
with
the
children
of
the
nation
and
advanced
health
measures
for
illinois
were
compared
with
those
of
other
states
the
investigations
of
thus
tend
to
be
merged
with
those
of
larger
organizations
from
the
investigation
of
the
social
value
of
saloons
made
for
the
committee
of
fifty
in
to
the
one
on
infant
mortality
in
relation
to
nationality
made
for
the
american
academy
of
science
in
this
is
also
true
of
activities
in
regard
to
public
movements
some
of
which
are
inaugurated
by
the
residents
of
other
settlements
as
the
chicago
school
of
civics
and
philanthropy
founded
by
the
splendid
efforts
of
graham
taylor
for
many
years
head
of
chicago
commons
all
of
our
recent
investigations
into
housing
have
been
under
the
department
of
investigation
of
this
school
with
which
several
of
the
residents
are
identified
quite
as
our
active
measures
to
secure
better
housing
conditions
have
been
carried
on
with
the
city
homes
association
and
through
the
cooperation
of
one
of
our
residents
who
several
years
ago
was
appointed
a
sanitary
inspector
on
the
city
staff
perhaps
taylor
himself
offers
the
best
possible
example
of
the
value
of
settlement
experience
to
public
undertakings
in
his
manifold
public
activities
of
which
one
might
instance
his
work
at
the
moment
upon
a
commission
recently
appointed
by
the
governor
of
illinois
to
report
upon
the
best
method
of
industrial
insurance
or
employer
liability
acts
and
his
influence
in
securing
another
to
study
into
the
subject
of
industrial
diseases
the
actual
factory
investigation
under
the
latter
is
in
charge
of
hamilton
of
whose
long
residence
in
an
industrial
neighborhood
as
well
as
her
scientific
attainment
give
her
peculiar
qualifications
for
the
undertaking
and
so
a
settlement
is
led
along
from
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
as
may
easily
be
illustrated
many
years
ago
a
union
meeting
at
asked
our
cooperation
in
tagging
the
various
parts
of
a
man
coat
in
such
wise
as
to
show
the
money
paid
to
the
people
who
had
made
it
one
tag
for
the
cutting
and
another
for
the
buttonholes
another
for
the
finishing
and
so
on
the
resulting
total
to
be
compared
with
the
selling
price
of
the
coat
itself
it
quickly
became
evident
that
we
had
no
way
of
computing
how
much
of
this
larger
balance
was
spent
for
salesmen
commercial
travelers
rent
and
management
and
the
poor
tagged
coat
was
finally
left
hanging
limply
in
a
closet
as
if
discouraged
with
the
attempt
but
the
desire
of
the
manual
worker
to
know
the
relation
of
his
own
labor
to
the
whole
is
not
only
legitimate
but
must
form
the
basis
of
any
intelligent
action
for
his
improvement
it
was
therefore
with
the
hope
of
reform
in
the
sewing
trades
that
the
residents
testified
before
the
federal
industrial
commission
in
and
much
later
with
genuine
enthusiasm
joined
with
and
other
citizens
in
an
industrial
exhibit
which
made
a
graphic
presentation
of
the
conditions
and
rewards
of
labor
the
large
casino
building
in
which
it
was
held
was
filled
every
day
and
evening
for
two
weeks
showing
how
popular
such
information
is
if
it
can
be
presented
graphically
as
an
illustration
of
this
same
moving
from
the
smaller
to
the
larger
i
might
instance
the
efforts
of
miss
mcdowell
of
the
university
of
chicago
settlement
and
others
in
urging
upon
congress
the
necessity
for
a
special
investigation
into
the
conditions
of
women
and
children
in
industry
because
we
had
discovered
the
insuperable
difficulties
of
smaller
investigations
notably
one
undertaken
for
the
illinois
bureau
of
labor
by
van
der
vaart
of
neighborhood
house
and
by
miss
breckinridge
of
the
university
of
chicago
this
investigation
made
clear
that
it
was
as
impossible
to
detach
the
girls
working
in
the
stockyards
from
their
sisters
in
industry
as
it
was
to
urge
special
legislation
on
their
behalf
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
american
settlements
the
residents
were
sometimes
impatient
with
the
accepted
methods
of
charitable
administration
and
hoped
through
residence
in
an
industrial
neighborhood
to
discover
more
cooperative
and
advanced
methods
of
dealing
with
the
problems
of
poverty
which
are
so
dependent
upon
industrial
maladjustment
but
during
twenty
years
the
settlements
have
seen
the
charitable
people
through
their
very
knowledge
of
the
poor
constantly
approach
nearer
to
those
methods
formerly
designated
as
radical
the
residents
so
far
from
holding
aloof
from
organized
charity
find
testimony
certainly
in
the
national
conferences
that
out
of
the
most
persistent
and
intelligent
efforts
to
alleviate
poverty
will
in
all
probability
arise
the
most
significant
suggestions
for
eradicating
poverty
in
the
hearing
before
a
congressional
committee
for
the
establishment
of
a
children
bureau
residents
in
american
settlements
joined
their
fellow
philanthropists
in
urging
the
need
of
this
indispensable
instrument
for
collecting
and
disseminating
information
which
would
make
possible
concerted
intelligent
action
on
behalf
of
children
howells
has
said
that
we
are
all
so
besotted
with
our
novel
reading
that
we
have
lost
the
power
of
seeing
certain
aspects
of
life
with
any
sense
of
reality
because
we
are
continually
looking
for
the
possible
romance
the
description
might
apply
to
the
earlier
years
of
the
american
settlement
but
certainly
the
later
years
are
filled
with
discoveries
in
actual
life
as
romantic
as
they
are
unexpected
if
i
may
illustrate
one
of
these
romantic
discoveries
from
my
own
experience
i
would
cite
the
indications
of
an
internationalism
as
sturdy
and
virile
as
it
is
unprecedented
which
i
have
seen
in
our
cosmopolitan
neighborhood
when
a
south
italian
catholic
is
forced
by
the
very
exigencies
of
the
situation
to
make
friends
with
an
austrian
jew
representing
another
nationality
and
another
religion
both
of
which
cut
into
all
his
most
cherished
prejudices
he
finds
it
harder
to
utilize
them
a
second
time
and
gradually
loses
them
he
thus
modifies
his
provincialism
for
if
an
old
enemy
working
by
his
side
has
turned
into
a
friend
almost
anything
may
happen
when
therefore
i
became
identified
with
the
peace
movement
both
in
its
international
and
national
conventions
i
hoped
that
this
internationalism
engendered
in
the
immigrant
quarters
of
american
cities
might
be
recognized
as
an
effective
instrument
in
the
cause
of
peace
i
first
set
it
forth
with
some
misgiving
before
the
convention
held
in
boston
in
and
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
recall
the
hearty
assent
given
to
it
by
professor
william
james
i
have
always
objected
to
the
phrase
sociological
laboratory
applied
to
us
because
settlements
should
be
something
much
more
human
and
spontaneous
than
such
a
phrase
connotes
and
yet
it
is
inevitable
that
the
residents
should
know
their
own
neighborhoods
more
thoroughly
than
any
other
and
that
their
experiences
there
should
affect
their
convictions
years
ago
i
was
much
entertained
by
a
story
told
at
the
chicago
woman
club
by
one
of
its
ablest
members
in
the
discussion
following
a
paper
of
mine
on
the
outgrowths
of
toynbee
hall
she
said
that
when
she
was
a
little
girl
playing
in
her
garden
she
one
day
discovered
a
small
toad
who
seemed
to
her
very
forlorn
and
lonely
although
she
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
comfort
him
she
reluctantly
left
him
to
his
fate
later
in
the
day
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
she
found
a
large
toad
also
apparently
without
family
and
friends
with
a
heart
full
of
tender
sympathy
she
took
a
stick
and
by
exercising
infinite
patience
and
some
skill
she
finally
pushed
the
little
toad
through
the
entire
length
of
the
garden
into
the
company
of
the
big
toad
when
to
her
inexpressible
horror
and
surprise
the
big
toad
opened
his
mouth
and
swallowed
the
little
one
the
moral
of
the
tale
was
clear
applied
to
people
who
lived
where
they
did
not
naturally
belong
although
i
protested
that
was
exactly
what
we
wanted
to
be
swallowed
and
digested
to
disappear
into
the
bulk
of
the
people
twenty
years
later
i
am
willing
to
testify
that
something
of
the
sort
does
take
place
after
years
of
identification
with
an
industrial
community

is
totally
inadequate
to
deal
with
the
vast
numbers
of
the
city
disinherited
we
also
quickly
came
to
realize
that
there
are
certain
types
of
wretchedness
from
which
every
private
philanthropy
shrinks
and
which
are
cared
for
only
in
those
wards
of
the
county
hospital
provided
for
the
wrecks
of
vicious
living
or
in
the
city
isolation
hospital
for
smallpox
patients
i
have
heard
a
mother
exclaim
when
her
erring
daughter
came
home
at
last
too
broken
and
diseased
to
be
taken
into
the
family
she
had
disgraced
there
is
no
place
for
her
but
the
top
floor
of
the
county
hospital
they
will
have
to
take
her
there
and
this
only
after
every
possible
expedient
had
been
tried
or
suggested
this
aspect
of
governmental
responsibility
was
unforgettably
borne
in
upon
me
during
the
smallpox
epidemic
following
the
world
fair
when
one
of
the
residents
kelley
as
state
factory
inspector
was
much
concerned
in
discovering
and
destroying
clothing
which
was
being
finished
in
houses
containing
unreported
cases
of
smallpox
the
deputy
most
successful
in
locating
such
cases
lived
at
during
the
epidemic
because
he
did
not
wish
to
expose
his
own
family
another
resident
miss
lathrop
as
a
member
of
the
state
board
of
charities
went
back
and
forth
to
the
crowded
pest
house
which
had
been
hastily
constructed
on
a
stretch
of
prairie
west
of
the
city
as
was
already
so
exposed
it
seemed
best
for
the
special
smallpox
inspectors
from
the
board
of
health
to
take
their
meals
and
change
their
clothing
there
before
they
went
to
their
respective
homes
all
of
these
officials
had
accepted
without
question
and
as
implicit
in
public
office
the
obligation
to
carry
on
the
dangerous
and
difficult
undertakings
for
which
private
philanthropy
is
unfitted
as
if
the
commonalty
of
compassion
represented
by
the
state
was
more
comprehending
than
that
of
any
individual
group
it
was
as
early
as
our
second
winter
on
halsted
street
that
one
of
the
residents
received
an
appointment
from
the
cook
county
agent
as
a
county
visitor
she
reported
at
the
agency
each
morning
and
all
the
cases
within
a
radius
of
ten
blocks
from
were
given
to
her
for
investigation
this
gave
her
a
legitimate
opportunity
for
knowing
the
poorest
people
in
the
neighborhood
and
also
for
understanding
the
county
method
of
outdoor
relief
the
commissioners
were
at
first
dubious
of
the
value
of
such
a
visitor
and
predicted
that
a
woman
would
be
a
perfect
coal
chute
for
giving
away
county
supplies
but
they
gradually
came
to
depend
upon
her
suggestion
and
advice
in
this
same
resident
miss
julia
lathrop
was
appointed
by
the
governor
a
member
of
the
illinois
state
board
of
charities
she
served
in
this
capacity
for
two
consecutive
terms
and
was
later
reappointed
to
a
third
term
perhaps
her
most
valuable
contribution
toward
the
enlargement
and
reorganization
of
the
charitable
institutions
of
the
state
came
through
her
intimate
knowledge
of
the
beneficiaries
and
her
experience
demonstrated
that
it
is
only
through
long
residence
among
the
poor
that
an
official
could
have
learned
to
view
public
institutions
as
she
did
from
the
standpoint
of
the
inmates
rather
than
from
that
of
the
managers
since
that
early
day
residents
of
have
spent
much
time
in
working
for
the
civil
service
methods
of
appointment
for
employees
in
the
county
and
state
institutions
for
the
establishment
of
state
colonies
for
the
care
of
epileptics
and
for
a
dozen
other
enterprises
which
occupy
that
borderland
between
charitable
effort
and
legislation
in
this
borderland
we
cooperate
in
many
civic
enterprises
for
i
think
we
may
claim
that
has
always
held
its
activities
lightly
ready
to
hand
them
over
to
whosoever
would
carry
them
on
properly
miss
starr
had
early
made
a
collection
of
framed
photographs
largely
of
the
paintings
studied
in
her
art
class
which
became
the
basis
of
a
loan
collection
first
used
by
the
students
and
later
extended
to
the
public
schools
it
may
be
fair
to
suggest
that
this
effort
was
the
nucleus
of
the
public
school
art
society
which
was
later
formed
in
the
city
and
of
which
miss
starr
was
the
first
president
in
our
first
two
summers
we
had
maintained
three
baths
in
the
basement
of
our
own
house
for
the
use
of
the
neighborhood
and
they
afforded
some
experience
and
argument
for
the
erection
of
the
first
public
bathhouse
in
chicago
which
was
built
on
a
neighboring
street
and
opened
under
the
city
board
of
health
the
lot
upon
which
it
was
erected
belonged
to
a
friend
of
who
offered
it
to
the
city
without
rent
and
this
enabled
the
city
to
erect
the
first
public
bath
from
the
small
appropriation
of
ten
thousand
dollars
great
fear
was
expressed
by
the
public
authorities
that
the
baths
would
not
be
used
and
the
old
story
of
the
bathtubs
in
model
tenements
which
had
been
turned
into
coal
bins
was
often
quoted
to
us
we
were
supplied
however
with
the
incontrovertible
argument
that
in
our
adjacent
third
square
mile
there
were
in
but
three
bathtubs
and
that
this
fact
was
much
complained
of
by
many
of
the
dwellers
our
contention
was
justified
by
the
immediate
and
overflowing
use
of
the
public
baths
as
we
had
before
been
sustained
in
the
contention
that
an
immigrant
population
would
respond
to
opportunities
for
reading
when
the
public
library
board
had
established
a
branch
reading
room
at
we
also
quickly
discovered
that
nothing
brought
us
so
absolutely
into
comradeship
with
our
neighbors
as
mutual
and
sustained
effort
such
as
the
paving
of
a
street
the
closing
of
a
gambling
house
or
the
restoration
of
a
veteran
police
sergeant
several
of
these
earlier
attempts
at
civic
cooperation
were
undertaken
in
connection
with
the
men
club
which
had
been
organized
in
the
spring
of
had
been
incorporated
under
a
state
charter
of
its
own
and
had
occupied
a
club
room
in
the
gymnasium
building
this
club
obtained
an
early
success
in
one
of
the
political
struggles
in
the
ward
and
thus
fastened
upon
itself
a
specious
reputation
for
political
power
it
was
at
last
so
torn
by
the
dissensions
of
two
political
factions
which
attempted
to
capture
it
that
although
it
is
still
an
existing
organization
it
has
never
regained
the
prestige
of
its
first
five
years
its
early
political
success
came
in
a
campaign
had
instigated
against
a
powerful
alderman
who
has
held
office
for
more
than
twenty
years
in
the
nineteenth
ward
and
who
although
notoriously
corrupt
is
still
firmly
intrenched
among
his
constituents
has
had
to
do
with
three
campaigns
organized
against
him
in
the
first
one
he
was
apparently
only
amused
at
our
sunday
school
effort
and
did
little
to
oppose
the
election
to
the
aldermanic
office
of
a
member
of
the
men
club
who
thus
became
his
colleague
in
the
city
council
when
however
made
an
effort
in
the
following
spring
against
the
of
the
alderman
himself
we
encountered
the
most
determined
and
skillful
opposition
in
these
campaigns
we
doubtless
depended
too
much
upon
the
idealistic
appeal
for
we
did
not
yet
comprehend
the
element
of
reality
always
brought
into
the
political
struggle
in
such
a
neighborhood
where
politics
deal
so
directly
with
getting
a
job
and
earning
a
living
we
soon
discovered
that
approximately
one
out
of
every
five
voters
in
the
nineteenth
ward
at
that
time
held
a
job
dependent
upon
the
good
will
of
the
alderman
there
were
no
civil
service
rules
to
interfere
and
the
unskilled
voter
swept
the
street
and
dug
the
sewer
as
secure
in
his
position
as
the
more
sophisticated
voter
who
tended
a
bridge
or
occupied
an
office
chair
in
the
city
hall
the
alderman
was
even
more
fortunate
in
finding
places
with
the
corporations
it
took
us
some
time
to
understand
why
so
large
a
proportion
of
our
neighbors
were
employees
and
why
we
had
such
a
large
club
composed
solely
of
telephone
girls
our
powerful
alderman
had
various
methods
of
entrenching
himself
many
people
were
indebted
to
him
for
his
kindly
services
in
the
police
station
and
the
justice
courts
for
in
those
days
irish
constituents
easily
broke
the
peace
and
before
the
establishment
of
the
juvenile
court
boys
were
arrested
for
very
trivial
offenses
added
to
these
were
hundreds
of
constituents
indebted
to
him
for
personal
kindness
from
the
peddler
who
received
a
free
license
to
the
businessman
who
had
a
railroad
pass
to
new
york
our
third
campaign
against
him
when
we
succeeded
in
making
a
serious
impression
upon
his
majority
evoked
from
his
henchmen
the
same
sort
of
hostility
which
a
striker
so
inevitably
feels
against
the
man
who
would
take
his
job
even
sharpened
by
the
sense
that
the
movement
for
reform
came
from
an
alien
source
another
result
of
the
campaign
was
an
expectation
on
the
part
of
our
new
political
friends
that
would
perform
like
offices
for
them
and
there
resulted
endless
confusion
and
misunderstanding
because
in
many
cases
we
could
not
even
attempt
to
do
what
the
alderman
constantly
did
with
a
right
good
will
when
he
protected
a
law
breaker
from
the
legal
consequences
of
his
act
his
kindness
appeared
not
only
to
himself
but
to
all
beholders
like
the
deed
of
a
powerful
and
kindly
statesman
when
on
the
other
hand
insisted
that
a
law
must
be
enforced
it
could
but
appear
like
the
persecution
of
the
offender
we
were
certainly
not
anxious
for
consistency
nor
for
individual
achievement
but
in
a
desire
to
foster
a
higher
political
morality
and
not
to
lower
our
standards
we
constantly
clashed
with
the
existing
political
code
we
also
unwittingly
stumbled
upon
a
powerful
combination
of
which
our
alderman
was
the
political
head
with
its
banking
its
ecclesiastical
and
its
journalistic
representatives
and
as
we
followed
up
the
clue
and
naively
told
all
we
discovered
we
of
course
laid
the
foundations
for
opposition
which
has
manifested
itself
in
many
forms
the
most
striking
expression
of
it
was
an
attack
upon
lasting
through
weeks
and
months
by
a
chicago
daily
newspaper
which
has
since
ceased
publication
during
the
third
campaign
i
received
many
anonymous
letters
those
from
the
men
often
obscene
those
from
the
women
revealing
that
curious
connection
between
prostitution
and
the
lowest
type
of
politics
which
every
city
tries
in
vain
to
hide
i
had
offers
from
the
men
in
the
city
prison
to
vote
properly
if
released
various
communications
from
keepers
as
to
the
prices
of
the
vote
they
were
ready
to
deliver
everywhere
appeared
that
animosity
which
is
evoked
only
when
a
man
feels
that
his
means
of
livelihood
is
threatened
as
i
look
back
i
am
reminded
of
the
state
of
mind
of
newspapermen
who
witnessed
a
volcanic
eruption
at
sea
in
which
unbelievable
creatures
were
expelled
to
the
surface
among
them
an
enormous
white
serpent
blind
and
smelling
of
musk
whose
death
throes
thrashed
the
sea
into
a
fury
with
professional
instinct
unimpaired
the
journalists
carefully
observed
the
uncanny
creature
never
designed
for
the
eyes
of
men
but
a
few
days
later
when
they
found
themselves
in
a
comfortable
carriage
traveling
from
southampton
to
london
between
trim
hedgerows
and
smug
english
villages
they
concluded
that
the
experience
was
too
sensational
to
be
put
before
the
british
public
and
it
became
improbable
even
to
themselves
many
subsequent
years
of
living
in
kindly
neighborhood
fashion
with
the
people
of
the
nineteenth
ward
has
produced
upon
my
memory
the
soothing
effect
of
the
railroad
carriage
and
many
of
these
political
experiences
have
not
only
become
remote
but
already
seem
improbable
on
the
other
hand
these
campaigns
were
not
without
their
rewards
one
of
them
was
a
quickened
friendship
both
with
the
more
substantial
citizens
in
the
ward
and
with
a
group
of
fine
young
voters
whose
devotion
to
has
never
since
failed
another
was
a
sense
of
identification
with
men
throughout
the
city
who
contributed
money
and
time
to
what
they
considered
a
gallant
effort
against
political
corruption
i
remember
a
young
professor
from
the
university
of
chicago
who
with
his
wife
came
to
live
at
traveling
the
long
distance
every
day
throughout
the
autumn
and
winter
that
he
might
qualify
as
a
voter
in
the
spring
campaign
he
served
as
a
watcher
at
the
polls
and
it
was
but
a
poor
reward
for
his
devotion
that
he
was
literally
set
upon
and
beaten
up
for
in
those
good
old
days
such
things
frequently
occurred
many
another
case
of
devotion
to
our
standard
so
recklessly
raised
might
be
cited
but
perhaps
more
valuable
than
any
of
these
was
the
sense
of
identification
we
obtained
with
the
rest
of
chicago
so
far
as
a
settlement
can
discern
and
bring
to
local
consciousness
neighborhood
needs
which
are
common
needs
and
can
give
vigorous
help
to
the
municipal
measures
through
which
such
needs
shall
be
met
it
fulfills
its
most
valuable
function
to
illustrate
from
our
first
effort
to
improve
the
street
paving
in
the
vicinity
we
found
that
when
we
had
secured
the
consent
of
the
majority
of
the
property
owners
on
a
given
street
for
a
new
paving
the
alderman
checked
the
entire
plan
through
his
kindly
service
to
one
man
who
had
appealed
to
him
to
keep
the
assessments
down
the
street
long
remained
a
shocking
mass
of
wet
dilapidated
cedar
blocks
where
children
were
sometimes
mired
as
they
floated
a
surviving
block
in
the
water
which
speedily
filled
the
holes
whence
other
blocks
had
been
extracted
for
fuel
and
yet
when
we
were
able
to
demonstrate
that
the
street
paving
had
thus
been
reduced
into
cedar
pulp
by
the
heavily
loaded
wagons
of
an
adjacent
factory
that
the
expense
of
its
repaving
should
be
borne
from
a
general
fund
and
not
by
the
poor
property
owners
we
found
that
we
could
all
unite
in
advocating
reform
in
the
method
of
repaving
assessments
and
the
alderman
himself
was
obliged
to
come
into
such
a
popular
movement
the
nineteenth
ward
improvement
association
which
met
at
during
two
winters
was
the
first
body
of
citizens
able
to
make
a
real
impression
upon
the
local
paving
situation
they
secured
an
expert
to
watch
the
paving
as
it
went
down
to
be
sure
that
their
half
of
the
paving
money
was
well
expended
in
the
belief
that
property
values
would
be
thus
enhanced
the
common
aim
brought
together
the
more
prosperous
people
of
the
vicinity
somewhat
as
the
cooperative
coal
association
brought
together
the
poorer
ones
i
remember
that
during
the
second
campaign
against
our
alderman
governor
pingree
of
michigan
came
to
visit
at
he
said
that
the
stronghold
of
such
a
man
was
not
the
place
in
which
to
start
municipal
regeneration
that
good
aldermen
should
be
elected
from
the
promising
wards
first
until
a
majority
of
honest
men
in
the
city
council
should
make
politics
unprofitable
for
corrupt
men
we
replied
that
it
was
difficult
to
divide
chicago
into
good
and
bad
wards
but
that
a
new
organization
called
the
municipal
voters
league
was
attempting
to
give
to
the
voter
in
each
ward
throughout
the
city
accurate
information
concerning
the
candidates
and
their
relation
past
and
present
to
vital
issues
one
of
our
trustees
who
was
most
active
in
inaugurating
this
league
always
said
that
his
experience
had
convinced
him
of
the
unity
of
city
politics
and
that
he
constantly
used
our
campaign
as
a
challenge
to
the
unaroused
citizens
living
in
wards
less
conspicuously
corrupt
certainly
the
need
for
civic
cooperation
was
obvious
in
many
directions
and
in
none
more
strikingly
than
in
that
organized
effort
which
must
be
carried
on
unceasingly
if
young
people
are
to
be
protected
from
the
darker
and
coarser
dangers
of
the
city
the
cooperation
between
and
the
juvenile
protective
association
came
about
gradually
and
it
seems
now
almost
inevitably
from
our
earliest
days
we
saw
many
boys
constantly
arrested
and
i
had
a
number
of
most
enlightening
experiences
in
the
police
station
with
an
irish
lad
whose
mother
upon
her
deathbed
had
begged
me
to
look
after
him
we
were
distressed
by
the
gangs
of
very
little
boys
who
would
sally
forth
with
an
enterprising
leader
in
search
of
old
brass
and
iron
sometimes
breaking
into
empty
houses
for
the
sake
of
the

thus
obtained

would
buy

station
at

agreed
to
give
her
provisional
charge
of
every
boy
and
girl
under
arrest
for
a
trivial
offense
stevens
who
performed
this
work
for
several
years
became
the
first
probation
officer
of
the
juvenile
court
when
it
was
established
in
cook
county
in
she
was
the
sole
probation
officer
at
first
but
at
the
time
of
her
death
which
occurred
at
in
she
was
the
senior
officer
of
a
corps
of
six
her
entire
experience
had
fitted
her
to
deal
wisely
with
wayward
children
she
had
gone
into
a
new
england
cotton
mill
at
the
age
of
thirteen
where
she
had
promptly
lost
the
index
finger
of
her
right
hand
through
carelessness
she
was
told
and
no
one
then
seemed
to
understand
that
freedom
from
care
was
the
prerogative
of
childhood
later
she
became
a
typesetter
and
was
one
of
the
first
women
in
america
to
become
a
member
of
the
typographical
union
retaining
her
card
through
all
the
later
years
of
editorial
work
as
the
juvenile
court
developed
the
committee
of
citizens
who
first
supplied
only
salary
later
maintained
a
corps
of
such
officers
several
of
these
were
residents
who
brought
to
the
house
for
many
years
a
sad
little
procession
of
children
struggling
against
all
sorts
of
handicaps
when
legislation
was
secured
which
placed
the
probation
officers
upon
the
payroll
of
the
county
it
was
a
challenge
to
the
efficiency
of
the
civil
service
method
of
appointment
to
obtain
by
examination
men
and
women
fitted
for
this
delicate
human
task
as
one
of
five
people
asked
by
the
civil
service
commission
to
conduct
this
first
examination
for
probation
officers
i
became
convinced
that
we
were
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
nonpolitical
method
of
selecting
public
servants
but
even
stiff
and
unbending
as
the
examination
may
be
it
is
still
our
hope
of
political
salvation
in
the
juvenile
court
was
housed
in
a
model
court
building
of
its
own
containing
a
detention
home
and
equipped
with
a
competent
staff
the
committee
of
citizens
largely
responsible
for
this
result
thereupon
turned
their
attention
to
the
conditions
which
the
records
of
the
court
indicated
had
led
to
the
alarming
amount
of
juvenile
delinquency
and
crime
they
organized
the
juvenile
protective
association
whose
officers
meet
weekly
at
with
their
executive
committee
to
report
what
they
have
found
and
to
discuss
city
conditions
affecting
the
lives
of
children
and
young
people
the
association
discovers
that
there
are
certain
temptations
into
which
children
so
habitually
fall
that
it
is
evident
that
the
average
child
can
not
withstand
them
an
overwhelming
mass
of
data
is
accumulated
showing
the
need
of
enforcing
existing
legislation
and
of
securing
new
legislation
but
it
also
indicates
a
hundred
other
directions
in
which
the
young
people
who
so
gaily
walk
our
streets
often
to
their
own
destruction
need
safeguarding
and
protection
the
effort
of
the
association
to
treat
the
youth
of
the
city
with
consideration
and
understanding
has
rallied
the
most
unexpected
forces
to
its
standard
quite
as
the
basic
needs
of
life
are
supplied
solely
by
those
who
make
money
out
of
the
business
so
the
modern
city
has
assumed
that
the
craving
for
pleasure
must
be
ministered
to
only
by
the
sordid
this
assumption
however
in
a
large
measure
broke
down
as
soon
as
the
juvenile
protective
association
courageously
put
it
to
the
test
after
persistent
prosecutions
but
also
after
many
friendly
interviews
the
druggists
association
itself
prosecutes
those
of
its
members
who
sell
indecent
postal
cards
the
saloon
keepers
protective
association
not
only
declines
to
protect
members
who
sell
liquor
to
minors
but
now
takes
drastic
action
to
prevent
such
sales
the
retail
grocers
association
forbids
the
selling
of
tobacco
to
minors
the
association
of
department
store
managers
not
only
increased
the
vigilance
in
their
waiting
rooms
by
supplying
more
matrons
but
as
a
body
they
have
become
regular
contributors
to
the
association
the
special
watchmen
in
all
the
railroad
yards
agree
not
to
arrest
trespassing
boys
but
to
report
them
to
the
association
the
firms
manufacturing
moving
picture
films
not
only
submit
their
films
to
a
volunteer
inspection
committee
but
ask
for
suggestions
in
regard
to
new
matter
and
the
theaters
arrange
for
stunts
which
shall
deal
with
the
subject
of
public
health
and
morals
when
the
lecturers
provided
are
entertaining
as
well
as
instructive
it
is
not
difficult
to
arouse
the
impulse
of
protection
for
the
young
which
would
doubtless
dictate
the
daily
acts
of
many
a
bartender
and
poolroom
keeper
if
they
could
only
indulge
it
without
giving
their
rivals
an
advantage
when
this
difficulty
is
removed
by
an
enforcement
of
the
law
that
simple
kindliness
which
the
innocent
always
evoke
goes
from
one
to
another
like
a
slowly
spreading
flame
of
good
will
doubtless
the
most
rewarding
experience
in
any
such
undertaking
as
that
of
the
juvenile
protective
association
is
the
warm
and
intelligent
cooperation
coming
from
unexpected
sources
official
and
commercial
as
well
as
philanthropic
upon
the
suggestion
of
the
association
social
centers
have
been
opened
in
various
parts
of
the
city
disused
buildings
turned
into
recreation
rooms
vacant
lots
made
into
gardens
hiking
parties
organized
for
country
excursions
bathing
beaches
established
on
the
lake
front
and
public
schools
opened
for
social
purposes
through
the
efforts
of
citizens
a
medical
clinic
and
a
psychopathic
institute
have
become
associated
with
the
juvenile
court
of
chicago
in
addition
to
which
an
exhaustive
study
of
has
been
completed
to
this
carefully
collected
data
concerning
the
abnormal
child
the
juvenile
protective
association
hopes
in
time
to
add
knowledge
of
the
normal
child
who
lives
under
the
most
adverse
city
conditions
it
was
not
without
hope
that
i
might
be
able
to
forward
in
the
public
school
system
the
solution
of
some
of
these
problems
of
delinquency
so
dependent
upon
truancy
and
education
that
i
became
a
member
of
the
chicago
board
of
education
in
july
it
is
impossible
to
write
of
the
situation
as
it
became
dramatized
in
half
a
dozen
strong
personalities
but
the
entire
experience
was
so
illuminating
as
to
the
difficulties
and
limitations
of
democratic
government
that
it
would
be
unfair
in
a
chapter
on
civic
cooperation
not
to
attempt
an
outline
even
the
briefest
statement
however
necessitates
a
review
of
the
preceding
few
years
for
a
decade
the
chicago
school
teachers
or
rather
a
majority
of
them
who
were
organized
into
the
teachers
federation
had
been
engaged
in
a
conflict
with
the
board
of
education
both
for
more
adequate
salaries
and
for
more
in
the
conduct
of
the
schools
in
pursuance
of
the
first
object
they
had
attacked
the
tax
dodger
along
the
entire
line
of
his
defense
from
the
curbstone
to
the
supreme
court
they
began
with
an
intricate
investigation
which
uncovered
the
fact
that
in
of
value
of
public
utility
corporations
paid
nothing
in
taxes
the
teachers
federation
brought
a
suit
which
was
prosecuted
through
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
resulted
in
an
order
entered
against
the
state
board
of
equalization
demanding
that
it
tax
the
corporations
mentioned
in
the
bill
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
companies
sought
federal
aid
and
obtained
an
order
which
restrained
the
payment
of
a
portion
of
the
tax
each
year
since
the
chicago
board
of
education
has
benefited
to
the
extent
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
although
this
result
had
been
attained
through
the
unaided
efforts
of
the
teachers
to
their
surprise
and
indignation
their
salaries
were
not
increased
the
teachers
federation
therefore
brought
a
suit
against
the
board
of
education
for
the
advance
which
had
been
promised
them
three
years
earlier
but
never
paid
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
in
their
favor
but
the
board
of
education
appealed
the
case
and
this
was
the
situation
when
the
seven
new
members
appointed
by
mayor
dunne
in
took
their
seats
the
conservative
public
suspected
that
these
new
members
were
merely
representatives
of
the
teachers
federation
this
opinion
was
founded
upon
the
fact
that
judge
dunne
had
rendered
a
favorable
decision
in
the
teachers
suit
and
that
the
teachers
had
been
very
active
in
the
campaign
which
had
resulted
in
his
election
as
mayor
of
the
city
it
seemed
obvious
that
the
teachers
had
entered
into
politics
for
the
sake
of
securing
their
own
representatives
on
the
board
of
education
these
suspicions
were
of
course
only
confirmed
when
the
new
board
voted
to
withdraw
the
suit
of
their
predecessors
from
the
appellate
court
and
to
act
upon
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
the
teachers
on
the
other
hand
defended
their
long
effort
in
the
courts
the
state
board
of
equalization
and
the
legislature
against
the
charge
of
dragging
the
schools
into
politics
and
declared
that
the
exposure
of
the
indifference
and
cupidity
of
the
politicians
was
a
rebuke
and
that
it
was
the
politicians
who
had
brought
the
schools
to
the
verge
of
financial
ruin
they
further
insisted
that
the
levy
and
collection
of
taxes
tenure
of
office
and
pensions
to
civil
servants
in
chicago
were
all
entangled
with
the
traction
situation
which
in
their
minds
at
least
had
come
to
be
an
example
of
the
struggle
between
the
democratic
and
plutocratic
administration
of
city
affairs
the
new
appointees
to
the
school
board
represented
no
concerted
policy
of
any
kind
but
were
for
the
most
part
adherents
to
the
new
education
the
teachers
confident
that
their
cause
was
identical
with
the
principles
advocated
by
such
educators
as
colonel
parker
were
therefore
sure
that
the
plans
of
the
new
education
members
would
of
necessity
coincide
with
the
plans
of
the
teachers
federation
in
one
sense
the
situation
was
an
epitome
of
mayor
dunne
entire
administration
which
was
founded
upon
the
belief
that
if
those
citizens
representing
social
ideals
and
reform
principles
were
but
appointed
to
office
public
welfare
must
be
established
during
my
tenure
of
office
i
many
times
talked
to
the
officers
of
the
teachers
federation
but
i
was
seldom
able
to
follow
their
suggestions
and
although
i
gladly
cooperated
in
their
plans
for
a
better
pension
system
and
other
matters
only
once
did
i
try
to
influence
the
policy
of
the
federation
when
the
withheld
salaries
were
finally
paid
to
the
representatives
of
the
federation
who
had
brought
suit
and
were
divided
among
the
members
who
had
suffered
both
financially
and
professionally
during
this
long
legal
struggle
i
was
most
anxious
that
the
division
should
voluntarily
be
extended
to
all
of
the
teachers
who
had
experienced
a
loss
of
salary
although
they
were
not
members
of
the
federation
it
seemed
to
me
a
striking
opportunity
to
refute
the
charge
that
the
federation
was
and
to
put
the
whole
long
effort
in
the
minds
of
the
public
exactly
where
it
belonged
as
one
of
devoted
public
service
but
it
was
doubtless
much
easier
for
me
to
urge
this
altruistic
policy
than
it
was
for
those
who
had
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
to
act
upon
it
the
second
object
of
the
teachers
federation
also
entailed
much
stress
and
storm
at
the
time
of
the
financial
stringency
and
largely
as
a
result
of
it
the
board
had
made
the
first
substantial
advance
in
a
teacher
salary
dependent
upon
a
promotional
examination
half
of
which
was
upon
academic
subjects
entailing
a
long
and
severe
preparation
the
teachers
resented
this
upon
two
lines
of
argument
first
that
the
scheme
was
unprofessional
in
that
the
teacher
was
advanced
on
her
capacity
as
a
student
rather
than
on
her
professional
ability
and
second
that
it
added
an
intolerable
and
unnecessary
burden
to
her
already
overfull
day
the
administration
on
the
other
hand
contended
with
much
justice
that
there
was
a
constant
danger
in
a
great
public
school
system
that
teachers
lose
pliancy
and
the
open
mind
and
that
many
of
them
had
obviously
grown
mechanical
and
indifferent
the
conservative
public
approved
the
promotional
examinations
as
the
symbol
of
an
advancing
educational
standard
and
their
sympathy
with
the
superintendent
was
increased
because
they
continually
resented
the
affiliation
of
the
teachers
federation
with
the
chicago
federation
of
labor
which
had
taken
place
several
years
before
the
election
of
mayor
dunne
on
his
traction
platform
this
much
talked
of
affiliation
between
the
teachers
and
the
had
been
at
least
in
the
first
instance
but
one
more
tactic
in
the
long
struggle
against
the
corporations
the
teachers
federation
had
won
in
their
first
skirmish
against
that
public
indifference
which
is
generated
in
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
which
has
for
its
nucleus
successful
commercial
men
when
they
found
themselves
in
need
of
further
legislation
to
keep
the
offending
corporations
under
control
they
naturally
turned
for
political
influence
and
votes
to
the
organization
representing
workingmen
the
affiliation
had
none
of
the
sinister
meaning
so
often
attached
to
it
the
teachers
federation
never
obtained
a
charter
from
the
american
federation
of
labor
and
its
main
interest
always
centered
in
the
legislative
committee
and
yet
this
statement
of
the
difference
between
the
majority
of
the
teachers
and
the
chicago
school
board
is
totally
inadequate
for
the
difficulties
were
stubborn
and
lay
far
back
in
the
long
effort
of
public
school
administration
in
america
to
free
itself
from
the
rule
and
exploitation
of
politics
in
every
city
for
many
years
the
politician
had
secured
positions
for
his
friends
as
teachers
and
janitors
he
had
received
a
in
the
contract
for
every
new
building
or
coal
supply
or
adoption
of
in
the
long
struggle
against
this
political
corruption
the
one
remedy
continually
advocated
was
the
transfer
of
authority
in
all
educational
matters
from
the
board
to
the
superintendent
the
one
cure
for
pull
and
corruption
was
the
authority
of
the
expert
the
rules
and
records
of
the
chicago
board
of
education
are
full
of
relics
of
this
long
struggle
honestly
waged
by
honest
men
who
unfortunately
became
content
with
the
ideals
of
an
efficient
business
administration
these
businessmen
established
an
able
superintendent
with
a
large
salary
with
his
tenure
of
office
secured
by
state
law
so
that
he
would
not
be
disturbed
by
the
wrath
of
the
balked
politician
they
instituted
impersonal
examinations
for
the
teachers
both
as
to
entrance
into
the
system
and
promotion
and
they
proceeded
to
hold
the
superintendent
responsible
for
schools
all
this
however
dangerously
approximated
the
commercialistic
ideal
of
high
salaries
only
for
the
management
with
the
final
test
of
a
small
expense
account
and
a
large
output
in
this
long
struggle
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
to
free
the
public
schools
from
political
interference
in
chicago
at
least
the
high
wall
of
defense
erected
around
the
school
system
in
order
to
keep
the
rascals
out
unfortunately
so
restricted
the
teachers
inside
the
system
that
they
had
no
space
in
which
to
move
about
freely
and
the
more
adventurous
of
them
fairly
panted
for
light
and
air
any
attempt
to
lower
the
wall
for
the
sake
of
the
teachers
within
was
regarded
as
giving
an
opportunity
to
the
politicians
without
and
they
were
often
openly
accused
with
a
show
of
truth
of
being
in
league
with
each
other
whenever
the
dunne
members
of
the
board
attempted
to
secure
more
liberty
for
the
teachers
we
were
warned
by
tales
of
former
difficulties
with
the
politicians
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
struggle
so
long
the
focus
of
attention
should
recede
into
the
dullness
of
the
achieved
and
allow
the
energy
of
the
board
to
be
free
for
new
effort
the
whole
situation
between
the
superintendent
supported
by
a
majority
of
the
board
and
the
teachers
federation
had
become
an
epitome
of
the
struggle
between
efficiency
and
democracy
on
one
side
a
expression
of
the
bureaucracy
necessary
in
a
large
system
but
which
under
pressure
had
become
unnecessarily
and
on
the
other
side
a
fairly
militant
demand
for
made
in
the
name
of
freedom
both
sides
inevitably
exaggerated
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
and
both
felt
that
they
were
standing
by
important
principles
i
certainly
played
a
most
inglorious
part
in
this
unnecessary
conflict
i
was
chairman
of
the
school
management
committee
during
one
year
when
a
majority
of
the
members
seemed
to
me
exasperatingly
conservative
and
during
another
year
when
they
were
frustratingly
radical
and
i
was
of
course
highly
unsatisfactory
to
both
certainly
a
plan
to
retain
the
undoubted
benefit
of
required
study
for
teachers
in
such
wise
as
to
lessen
its
burden
and
various
schemes
devised
to
shift
the
emphasis
from
scholarship
to
professional
work
were
mostly
impatiently
repudiated
by
the
teachers
federation
and
when
one
badly
mutilated
plan
finally
passed
the
board
it
was
most
reluctantly
administered
by
the
superintendent
i
at
least
became
convinced
that
partisans
would
never
tolerate
the
use
of
they
are
much
too
impatient
to
look
on
while
their
beloved
scheme
is
unstably
balanced
and
they
would
rather
see
it
tumble
into
the
stream
at
once
than
to
have
it
brought
to
dry
land
in
any
such
fashion
before
my
school
board
experience
i
thought
that
life
had
taught
me
at
least
one
lesson
that
existing
arrangements
and
the
hoped
for
improvements
must
be
mediated
and
reconciled
to
each
other
that
the
new
must
be
dovetailed
into
the
old
as
it
were
if
it
were
to
endure
but
on
the
school
board
i
discerned
that
all
such
efforts
were
looked
upon
as
compromising
and
unworthy
by
both
partisans
in
the
general
disorder
and
public
excitement
resulting
from
the
illegal
dismissal
of
a
majority
of
the
dunne
board
and
their
reinstatement
by
a
court
decision
i
found
myself
belonging
to
neither
party
during
the
months
following
the
upheaval
and
the
loss
of
my
most
vigorous
colleagues
under
the
regime
of
men
representing
the
leading
commercial
club
of
the
city
who
honestly
believed
that
they
were
rescuing
the
schools
from
a
condition
of
chaos
i
saw
one
beloved
measure
after
another
withdrawn
although
the
new
president
scrupulously
gave
me
the
floor
in
the
defense
of
each
it
was
impossible
to
consider
them
upon
their
merits
in
the
lurid
light
which
at
the
moment
enveloped
all
the
plans
of
the
uplifters
thus
the
building
of
smaller
schoolrooms
such
as
in
new
york
mechanically
avoid
overcrowding
the
extension
of
the
truant
rooms
so
successfully
inaugurated
the
multiplication
of
school
playgrounds
and
many
another
cherished
plan
was
thrown
out
or
at
least
indefinitely
postponed
the
final
discrediting
of
mayor
dunne
appointees
to
the
school
board
affords
a
very
interesting
study
in
social
psychology
the
newspapers
had
so
constantly
reflected
and
intensified
the
ideals
of
a
business
board
and
had
so
persistently
ridiculed
various
administration
plans
for
the
municipal
ownership
of
street
railways
that
from
the
beginning
any
attempt
the
new
board
made
to
discuss
educational
matters
only
excited
their
derision
and
contempt
some
of
these
discussions
were
lengthy
and
disorderly
and
deserved
the
discipline
of
ridicule
but
others
which
were
well
conducted
and
in
which
educational
problems
were
seriously
set
forth
by
men
of
authority
were
ridiculed
quite
as
sharply
i
recall
the
surprise
and
indignation
of
a
university
professor
who
had
consented
to
speak
at
a
meeting
arranged
in
the
board
rooms
when
next
morning
his
nonpartisan
and
careful
disquisition
had
been
twisted
into
the
most
arrant
uplift
nonsense
and
so
connected
with
a
fake
newspaper
report
of
a
trial
marriage
address
delivered
not
by
himself
but
by
a
colleague
that
a
leading
clergyman
of
the
city
having
read
the
newspaper
account
felt
impelled
to
preach
a
sermon
calling
upon
all
decent
people
to
rally
against
the
doctrines
which
were
being
taught
to
the
children
by
an
immoral
school
board
as
the
bewildered
professor
had
lectured
in
response
to
my
invitation
i
endeavored
to
find
the
animus
of
the
complication
but
neither
from
editor
in
chief
nor
from
the
reporter
could
i
discover
anything
more
sinister
than
that
the
public
expected
a
good
story
out
of
these
school
board
talk
fests
and
that
any
man
who
even
momentarily
allied
himself
with
a
radical
administration
must
expect
to
be
ridiculed
by
those
papers
which
considered
the
traction
policy
of
the
administration
both
foolish
and
dangerous
as
i
myself
was
treated
with
uniform
courtesy
by
the
leading
papers
i
may
perhaps
here
record
my
discouragement
over
this
complicated
difficulty
of
open
discussion
for
democratic
government
is
founded
upon
the
assumption
that
differing
policies
shall
be
freely
discussed
and
that
each
party
shall
have
an
opportunity
for
at
least
a
partisan
presentation
of
its
contentions
this
attitude
of
the
newspapers
was
doubtless
intensified
because
the
dunne
school
board
had
instituted
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
validity
of
the
lease
for
the
school
ground
occupied
by
a
newspaper
building
this
suit
has
since
been
decided
in
favor
of
the
newspaper
and
it
may
be
that
in
their
resentment
they
felt
justified
in
doing
everything
possible
to
minimize
the
prosecuting
school
board
i
am
however
inclined
to
think
that
the
newspapers
but
reflected
an
opinion
honestly
held
by
many
people
and
that
their
constant
and
partisan
presentation
of
this
opinion
clearly
demonstrates
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
of
governmental
administration
in
a
city
grown
too
large
for
verbal
discussions
of
public
affairs
it
is
difficult
to
close
this
chapter
without
a
reference
to
the
efforts
made
in
chicago
to
secure
the
municipal
franchise
for
women
during
two
long
periods
of
agitation
for
a
new
city
charter
a
representative
body
of
women
appealed
to
the
public
to
the
charter
convention
and
to
the
illinois
legislature
for
this
very
reasonable
provision
during
the
campaign
when
i
acted
as
chairman
of
the
federation
of
a
hundred
women
organizations
nothing
impressed
me
so
forcibly
as
the
fact
that
the
response
came
from
bodies
of
women
representing
the
most
varied
traditions
we
were
joined
by
a
church
society
of
hundreds
of
lutheran
women
because
scandinavian
women
had
exercised
the
municipal
franchise
since
the
seventeenth
century
and
had
found
american
cities
strangely
conservative
by
organizations
of
working
women
who
had
keenly
felt
the
need
of
the
municipal
franchise
in
order
to
secure
for
their
workshops
the
most
rudimentary
sanitation
and
the
consideration
which
the
vote
alone
obtains
for
workingmen
by
federations
of
mothers
meetings
who
were
interested
in
clean
milk
and
the
extension
of
kindergartens
by
women
who
had
been
powerless
to
protest
against
unjust
taxation
by
organizations
of
professional
women
of
university
students
and
of
collegiate
alumnae
and
by
women
clubs
interested
in
municipal
reforms
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
the
traditional
rights
clamor
but
much
impressive
testimony
from
busy
and
useful
women
that
they
had
reached
the
place
where
they
needed
the
franchise
in
order
to
carry
on
their
own
affairs
a
striking
witness
as
to
the
need
of
the
ballot
even
for
the
women
who
are
restricted
to
the
most
primitive
and
traditional
activities
occurred
when
some
russian
women
waited
upon
me
to
ask
whether
under
the
new
charter
they
could
vote
for
covered
markets
and
so
get
rid
of
the
shocking
chicago
grime
upon
all
their
food
and
when
some
neighboring
italian
women
sent
me
word
that
they
would
certainly
vote
for
public
washhouses
if
they
ever
had
the
chance
to
vote
at
all
it
was
all
so
human
so
spontaneous
and
so
direct
that
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
time
must
be
ripe
for
political
expression
of
that
public
concern
on
the
part
of
women
which
had
so
long
been
forced
to
seek
indirection
none
of
these
busy
women
wished
to
take
the
place
of
men
nor
to
influence
them
in
the
direction
of
men
affairs
but
they
did
seek
an
opportunity
to
cooperate
directly
in
civic
life
through
the
use
of
the
ballot
in
regard
to
their
own
affairs
a
municipal
museum
which
was
established
in
the
chicago
public
library
building
several
years
ago
largely
through
the
activity
of
a
group
of
women
who
had
served
as
jurors
in
the
departments
of
social
economy
of
education
and
of
sanitation
in
the
fair
at
louis
showed
nothing
more
clearly
than
that
it
is
impossible
to
divide
any
of
these
departments
from
the
political
life
of
the
modern
city
which
is
constantly
forced
to
enlarge
the
boundary
of
its
activity

the
value
of
social
clubs
from
the
early
days
at
social
clubs
composed
of
english
speaking
american
born
young
people
grew
apace
so
eager
were
they
for
social
life
that
no
mistakes
in
management
could
drive
them
away
i
remember
one
enthusiastic
leader
who
read
aloud
to
a
club
a
translation
of
antigone
which
she
had
selected
because
she
believed
that
the
great
themes
of
the
greek
poets
were
best
suited
to
young
people
she
came
into
the
club
room
one
evening
in
time
to
hear
the
president
call
the
restive
members
to
order
with
the
statement
you
might
just
as
well
keep
quiet
for
she
is
bound
to
finish
it
and
the
quicker
she
gets
to
reading
the
longer
time
we
have
for
dancing
and
yet
the
same
club
leader
had
the
pleasure
of
lending
four
copies
of
the
drama
to
four
of
the
members
and
one
young
man
almost
literally
committed
the
entire
play
to
memory
on
the
whole
we
were
much
impressed
by
the
great
desire
for
for
study
and
debate
exhibited
by
many
of
the
young
men
this
very
tendency
in
fact
brought
one
of
the
most
promising
of
our
earlier
clubs
to
an
untimely
end
the
young
men
in
the
club
twenty
in
number
had
grown
much
irritated
by
the
frivolity
of
the
girls
during
their
long
debates
and
had
finally
proposed
that
three
of
the
most
frivolous
be
expelled
pending
a
final
vote
the
three
culprits
appealed
to
certain
of
their
friends
who
were
members
of
the
men
club
between
whom
and
the
debating
young
men
the
incident
became
the
cause
of
a
quarrel
so
bitter
that
at
length
it
led
to
a
shooting
fortunately
the
shot
missed
fire
or
it
may
have
been
true
that
it
was
only
intended
for
a
scare
but
at
any
rate
we
were
all
thoroughly
frightened
by
this
manifestation
of
the
hot
blood
which
the
defense
of
woman
has
so
often
evoked
after
many
efforts
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
the
debating
club
of
twenty
young
men
and
the
seventeen
young
women
who
either
were
or
pretended
to
be
sober
minded
rented
a
hall
a
mile
west
of
severing
their
connection
with
us
because
their
ambitious
and
efforts
had
been
unappreciated
basing
this
on
the
ground
that
we
had
not
urged
the
expulsion
of
the
tough
members
of
the
club
who
had
been
involved
in
the
difficulty
the
seceding
club
invited
me
to
the
first
meeting
in
their
new
quarters
that
i
might
present
to
them
my
version
of
the
situation
and
set
forth
the
incident
from
the
standpoint
of
the
discussion
i
had
with
the
young
people
that
evening
has
always
remained
with
me
as
one
of
the
moments
of
illumination
which
life
in
a
settlement
so
often
affords
in
response
to
my
position
that
a
desire
to
avoid
all
that
was
tough
meant
to
walk
only
in
the
paths
of
smug
and
personal
improvement
leading
straight
into
the
pit
of
and
petty
achievement
and
was
exactly
what
the
settlement
did
not
stand
for
they
contended
with
much
justice
that
ambitious
young
people
were
obliged
for
their
own
reputation
if
not
for
their
own
morals
to
avoid
all
connection
with
that
which
bordered
on
the
tough
and
that
it
was
quite
another
matter
for
the
residents
who
could
afford
a
more
generous
judgment
it
was
in
vain
i
urged
that
life
teaches
us
nothing
more
inevitably
than
that
right
and
wrong
are
most
confusingly
confounded
that
the
blackest
wrong
may
be
within
our
own
motives
and
that
at
the
best
right
will
not
dazzle
us
by
its
radiant
shining
and
can
only
be
found
by
exerting
patience
and
discrimination
they
still
maintained
their
wholesome
bourgeois
position
which
i
am
now
quite
ready
to
admit
was
most
reasonable
of
course
there
were
many
disappointments
connected
with
these
clubs
when
the
rewards
of
political
and
commercial
life
easily
drew
the
members
away
from
the
principles
advocated
in
club
meetings
one
of
the
young
men
who
had
been
a
shining
light
in
the
advocacy
of
municipal
reform
deserted
in
the
middle
of
a
reform
campaign
because
he
had
been
offered
a
lucrative
office
in
the
city
hall
another
even
after
a
course
of
lectures
on
business
morality
worked
the
club
itself
to
secure
orders
for
clothing
from
samples
of
cloth
he
displayed
although
the
orders
were
filled
by
suits
slightly
refitted
and
delivered
at
double
their
original
price
but
nevertheless
there
was
much
to
cheer
us
as
we
gradually
became
acquainted
with
the
daily
living
of
the
vigorous
young
men
and
women
who
filled
to
overflowing
all
the
social
clubs
we
have
been
much
impressed
during
our
twenty
years
by
the
ready
adaptation
of
city
young
people
to
the
prosperity
arising
from
their
own
increased
wages
or
from
the
commercial
success
of
their
families
this
quick
adaptability
is
the
great
gift
of
the
city
child
his
one
reward
for
the
hurried
changing
life
which
he
has
always
led
the
working
girl
has
a
distinct
advantage
in
the
task
of
transforming
her
whole
family
into
the
ways
and
connections
of
the
prosperous
when
she
works
down
town
and
becomes
conversant
with
the
manners
and
conditions
of
a
cosmopolitan
community
therefore
having
lived
in
a
settlement
twenty
years
i
see
scores
of
young
people
who
have
successfully
established
themselves
in
life
and
in
my
travels
in
the
city
and
outside
i
am
constantly
cheered
by
greetings
from
the
rising
young
lawyer
the
scholarly
rabbi
the
successful
teacher
the
prosperous
young
matron
buying
clothes
for
blooming
children
do
you
remember
me
i
used
to
belong
to
a
club
i
once
asked
one
of
these
young
people
a
man
who
held
a
good
position
on
a
chicago
daily
what
special
thing
had
meant
to
him
and
he
promptly
replied
it
was
the
first
house
i
had
ever
been
in
where
books
and
magazines
just
lay
around
as
if
there
were
plenty
of
them
in
the
world
do
you
remember
how
much
i
used
to
read
at
that
little
round
table
at
the
back
of
the
library
to
have
people
regard
reading
as
a
reasonable
occupation
changed
the
whole
aspect
of
life
to
me
and
i
began
to
have
confidence
in
what
i
could
do
among
the
young
men
of
the
social
clubs
a
large
proportion
of
the
jewish
ones
at
least
obtain
the
advantages
of
a
higher
education
the
parents
make
every
sacrifice
to
help
them
through
the
high
school
after
which
the
young
men
attend
universities
and
professional
schools
largely
through
their
own
efforts
from
time
to
time
they
come
back
to
us
with
their
honors
thick
upon
them
i
remember
one
who
returned
with
the
prize
in
oratory
from
a
contest
between
several
western
state
universities
proudly
testifying
that
he
had
obtained
his
confidence
in
our
henry
clay
club
another
came
back
with
a
degree
from
harvard
university
saying
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
there
the
summer
i
read
royce
aspects
of
modern
philosophy
with
a
group
of
young
men
who
had
challenged
my
scathing
remark
that
herbert
spencer
was
not
the
only
man
who
had
ventured
a
solution
of
the
riddles
of
the
universe
occasionally
one
of
these
learned
young
folk
does
not
like
to
be
reminded
he
once
lived
in
our
vicinity
but
that
happens
rarely
and
for
the
most
part
they
are
loyal
to
us
in
much
the
same
spirit
as
they
are
to
their
own
families
and
traditions
sometimes
they
go
further
and
tell
us
that
the
standards
of
tastes
and
code
of
manners
which
has
enabled
them
to
form
have
made
a
very
great
difference
in
their
perceptions
and
estimates
of
the
larger
world
as
well
as
in
their
own
reception
there
five
out
of
one
club
of
young
men
who
had
held
together
for
eleven
years
entered
the
university
of
chicago
but
although
the
rest
of
the
club
called
them
the
intellectuals
the
old
friendships
still
held
in
addition
to
these
rising
young
people
given
to
debate
and
dramatics
and
to
the
members
of
the
public
school
alumni
associations
which
meet
in
our
rooms
there
are
hundreds
of
others
who
for
years
have
come
to
frankly
in
search
of
that
pleasure
and
recreation
which
all
young
things
crave
and
which
those
who
have
spent
long
hours
in
a
factory
or
shop
demand
as
a
right
for
these
young
people
all
sorts
of
pleasure
clubs
have
been
cherished
and
large
dancing
classes
have
been
organized
one
supreme
gayety
has
come
to
be
an
annual
event
of
such
importance
that
it
is
talked
of
from
year
to
year
for
six
weeks
before
patrick
day
a
small
group
of
residents
put
their
best
powers
of
invention
and
construction
into
preparation
for
a
cotillion
which
is
like
a
pageant
in
its
gayety
and
vigor
the
parents
sit
in
the
gallery
and
the
mothers
appreciate
more
than
anyone
else
perhaps
the
value
of
this
ball
to
which
an
invitation
is
so
highly
prized
although
their
standards
of
manners
may
differ
widely
from
the
conventional
they
know
full
well
when
the
companionship
of
the
young
people
is
safe
and
unsullied
as
an
illustration
of
this
difference
in
standard
i
may
instance
an
early
picnic
arranged
by
a
club
of
young
people
who
found
at
the
last
moment
that
the
club
director
could
not
go
and
accepted
the
offer
of
the
mother
of
one
of
the
club
members
to
take
charge
of
them
when
they
trooped
back
in
the
evening
tired
and
happy
they
displayed
a
photograph
of
the
group
wherein
each
man
arm
was
carefully
placed
about
a
girl
no
feminine
waist
lacked
an
arm
save
that
of
the
proud
chaperon
who
sat
in
the
middle
smiling
upon
all
seeing
that
the
photograph
somewhat
surprised
us
the
chaperon
stoutly
explained
this
may
look
queer
to
you
but
there
was
one
thing
about
that
picnic
that
was
nice
and
her
statement
was
a
perfectly
truthful
one
although
more
conventional
customs
are
carefully
enforced
at
our
many
parties
and
festivities
and
while
the
dancing
classes
are
as
highly
prized
for
the
opportunity
they
afford
for
enforcing
standards
as
for
their
ostensible
aim
the
residents
at
in
their
efforts
to
provide
opportunities
for
clean
recreation
receive
the
most
valued
help
from
the
experienced
wisdom
of
the
older
women
of
the
neighborhood
bowen
hall
is
constantly
used
for
dancing
parties
with
soft
drinks
established
in
its
foyer
the
parties
given
by
the
clubs
are
by
invitation
and
the
young
people
themselves
carefully
maintain
their
standard
of
entrance
so
that
the
most
cautious
mother
may
feel
safe
when
her
daughter
goes
to
one
of
our
parties
no
club
festivity
is
permitted
without
the
presence
of
a
director
no
young
man
under
the
influence
of
liquor
is
allowed
certain
types
of
dancing
often
innocently
started
are
strictly
prohibited
and
above
all
early
closing
is
insisted
upon
this
standardizing
of
pleasure
has
always
seemed
an
obligation
to
the
residents
of
but
we
are
i
hope
saved
from
that
priggishness
which
young
people
so
heartily
resent
by
the
mardi
gras
dance
and
other
festivities
which
the
residents
themselves
arrange
and
successfully
carry
out
in
spite
of
our
belief
that
the
standards
of
a
ball
may
be
almost
as
valuable
to
those
without
as
to
those
within
the
residents
are
constantly
concerned
for
those
many
young
people
in
the
neighborhood
who
are
too
hedonistic
to
submit
to
the
discipline
of
a
dancing
class
or
even
to
the
claim
of
a
pleasure
club
but
who
go
about
in
freebooter
fashion
to
find
pleasure
wherever
it
may
be
cheaply
on
sale
such
young
people
well
meaning
but
impatient
of
control
become
the
easy
victims
of
the
worst
type
of
public
dance
halls
and
of
even
darker
places
whose
purposes
are
hidden
under
music
and
dancing
we
were
thoroughly
frightened
when
we
learned
that
during
the
year
which
ended
last
december
more
than
thousand
young
people
under
the
age
of
passed
through
the
juvenile
and
municipal
courts
of
chicago
approximately
one
out
of
every
eighty
of
the
entire
population
or
one
out
of
every
of
those
under
years
of
age
one
heart
aches
for
these
young
people
caught
by
the
outside
glitter
of
city
gayety
who
make
such
a
feverish
attempt
to
snatch
it
for
themselves
the
young
people
in
our
clubs
are
comparatively
safe
but
many
instances
come
to
the
knowledge
of
residents
which
make
us
long
for
the
time
when
the
city
through
more
small
parks
municipal
gymnasiums
and
schoolrooms
open
for
recreation
can
guard
from
disaster
these
young
people
who
walk
so
carelessly
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
the
heedless
girls
believe
that
if
they
lived
in
big
houses
and
possessed
pianos
and
jewelry
the
coveted
social
life
would
come
to
them
i
know
a
bohemian
girl
who
surreptitiously
saved
her
overtime
wages
until
she
had
enough
money
to
hire
for
a
week
a
room
with
a
piano
in
it
where
young
men
might
come
to
call
as
they
could
not
do
in
her
crowded
untidy
home
of
course
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
the
sort
of
young
men
who
quickly
discover
an
unprotected
girl
another
girl
of
american
parentage
who
had
come
to
chicago
to
seek
her
fortune
found
at
the
end
of
a
year
that
sorting
shipping
receipts
in
a
dark
corner
of
a
warehouse
not
only
failed
to
accumulate
riches
but
did
not
even
bring
the
attentions
which
her
quiet
country
home
afforded
by
dint
of
long
sacrifice
she
had
saved
fifteen
dollars
with
five
she
bought
an
imitation
sapphire
necklace
and
the
balance
she
changed
into
a
ten
dollar
bill
the
evening
her
pathetic
little
snare
was
set
she
walked
home
with
one
of
the
clerks
in
the
establishment
told
him
that
she
had
come
into
a
fortune
and
was
obliged
to
wear
the
heirloom
necklace
to
insure
its
safety
permitted
him
to
see
that
she
carried
ten
dollars
in
her
glove
for
carfare
and
conducted
him
to
a
handsome
prairie
avenue
residence
there
she
gayly
bade
him
and
ran
up
the
steps
shutting
herself
in
the
vestibule
from
which
she
did
not
emerge
until
the
dazzled
and
bewildered
young
man
had
vanished
down
the
street
then
there
is
the
difficulty
about
dress
the
insistence
of
the
young
to
be
gayly
bedecked
to
the
utter
consternation
of
the
hardworking
parents
who
are
paying
for
a
house
and
lot
the
polish
girl
who
stole
five
dollars
from
her
employer
till
with
which
to
buy
a
white
dress
for
a
church
picnic
was
turned
away
from
home
by
her
indignant
father
who
replaced
the
money
to
save
the
family
honor
but
would
harbor
no
thief
in
a
household
of
growing
children
who
in
spite
of
the
sister
revolt
continued
to
be
dressed
in
dark
heavy
clothes
through
all
the
hot
summer
there
are
a
multitude
of
working
girls
who
for
hours
carry
hair
ribbons
and
jewelry
in
their
pockets
or
stockings
for
they
can
wear
them
only
during
the
journey
to
and
from
work
sometimes
this
desire
to
taste
pleasure
to
escape
into
a
world
of
congenial
companionship
takes
more
elaborate
forms
and
often
ends
disastrously
i
recall
a
charming
young
girl
the
oldest
daughter
of
a
respectable
german
family
whom
i
first
saw
one
spring
afternoon
issuing
from
a
tall
factory
she
wore
a
blue
print
gown
which
so
deepened
the
blue
of
her
eyes
that
wordsworth
line
fairly
sung
itself
the
pliant
harebell
swinging
in
the
breeze
on
some
gray
rock
i
was
grimly
reminded
of
that
moment
a
year
later
when
i
heard
the
tale
of
this
girl
who
had
worked
steadily
in
the
same
factory
for
four
years
before
she
resolved
to
see
life
in
order
not
to
arouse
her
parents
suspicions
she
borrowed
thirty
dollars
from
one
of
those
loan
sharks
who
require
no
security
from
a
pretty
girl
so
that
she
might
start
from
home
every
morning
as
if
to
go
to
work
for
three
weeks
she
spent
the
first
part
of
each
dearly
bought
day
in
a
department
store
where
she
lunched
and
unfortunately
made
some
dubious
acquaintances
in
the
afternoon
she
established
herself
in
a
theater
and
sat
contentedly
hour
after
hour
watching
the
endless
vaudeville
until
the
usual
time
for
returning
home
at
the
end
of
each
week
she
gave
her
parents
her
usual
wage
but
when
her
thirty
dollars
was
exhausted
it
seemed
unendurable
that
she
should
return
to
the
monotony
of
the
factory
in
the
light
of
her
newly
acquired
experience
she
had
learned
that
possibility
which
the
city
ever
holds
open
to
the
restless
girl
that
more
such
girls
do
not
come
to
grief
is
due
to
those
mothers
who
understand
the
insatiable
demand
for
a
good
time
and
if
all
of
the
mothers
did
understand
those
pathetic
statistics
which
show
that
four
fifths
of
all
prostitutes
are
under
twenty
years
of
age
would
be
marvelously
changed
we
are
told
that
the
will
to
live
is
aroused
in
each
baby
by
his
mother
irresistible
desire
to
play
with
him
the
physiological
value
of
joy
that
a
child
is
born
and
that
the
high
death
rate
in
institutions
is
increased
by
the
discontented
babies
whom
no
one
persuades
into
living
something
of
the
same
sort
is
necessary
in
that
second
birth
at
adolescence
the
young
people
need
affection
and
understanding
each
one
for
himself
if
they
are
to
be
induced
to
live
in
an
inheritance
of
decorum
and
safety
and
to
understand
the
foundations
upon
which
this
orderly
world
rests
no
one
comprehends
their
needs
so
sympathetically
as
those
mothers
who
iron
the
flimsy
starched
finery
of
their
daughters
late
into
the
night
and
who
pay
for
a
red
velvet
parlor
set
on
the
installment
plan
although
the
younger
children
may
sadly
need
new
shoes
these
mothers
apparently
understand
the
sharp
demand
for
social
pleasure
and
do
their
best
to
respond
to
it
although
at
the
same
time
they
constantly
minister
to
all
the
physical
needs
of
an
exigent
family
of
little
children
we
often
come
to
a
realization
of
the
truth
of
walt
whitman
statement
that
one
of
the
surest
sources
of
wisdom
is
the
mother
of
a
large
family
it
is
but
natural
perhaps
that
the
members
of
the
woman
club
whose
prosperity
has
given
them
some
leisure
and
a
chance
to
remove
their
own
families
to
neighborhoods
less
full
of
temptations
should
have
offered
their
assistance
in
our
attempt
to
provide
recreation
for
these
restless
young
people
in
many
instances
their
experience
in
the
club
itself
has
enabled
them
to
perceive
these
needs
one
day
a
juvenile
court
officer
told
me
that
a
woman
club
member
who
has
a
large
family
of
her
own
and
one
boy
sufficiently
difficult
had
undertaken
to
care
for
a
ward
of
the
juvenile
court
who
lived
only
a
block
from
her
house
and
that
she
had
kept
him
in
the
path
of
rectitude
for
six
months
in
reply
to
my
congratulations
upon
this
successful
bit
of
reform
to
the
club
woman
herself
she
said
that
she
was
quite
ashamed
that
she
had
not
undertaken
the
task
earlier
for
she
had
for
years
known
the
boy
mother
who
scrubbed
a
downtown
office
building
leaving
home
every
evening
at
five
and
returning
at
eleven
during
the
very
time
the
boy
could
most
easily
find
opportunities
for
wrongdoing
she
said
that
her
obligation
toward
this
boy
had
not
occurred
to
her
until
one
day
when
the
club
members
were
making
pillowcases
for
the
detention
home
of
the
juvenile
court
it
suddenly
seemed
perfectly
obvious
that
her
share
in
the
salvation
of
wayward
children
was
to
care
for
this
particular
boy
and
she
had
asked
the
juvenile
court
officer
to
commit
him
to
her
she
invited
the
boy
to
her
house
to
supper
every
day
that
she
might
know
just
where
he
was
at
the
crucial
moment
of
twilight
and
she
adroitly
managed
to
keep
him
under
her
own
roof
for
the
evening
if
she
did
not
approve
of
the
plans
he
had
made
she
concluded
with
the
remark
that
it
was
queer
that
the
sight
of
the
boy
himself
had
appealed
to
her
but
that
the
suggestion
had
come
to
her
in
such
a
roundabout
way
she
was
of
course
reflecting
upon
a
common
trait
in
human
nature
that
we
much
more
easily
see
the
duty
at
hand
when
we
see
it
in
relation
to
the
social
duty
of
which
it
is
a
part
when
she
knew
that
an
effort
was
being
made
throughout
all
the
large
cities
in
the
united
states
to
reclaim
the
wayward
boy
to
provide
him
with
reasonable
amusement
to
give
him
his
chance
for
growth
and
development
and
when
she
became
ready
to
take
her
share
in
that
movement
she
suddenly
saw
the
concrete
case
which
she
had
not
recognized
before
we
are
slowly
learning
that
social
advance
depends
quite
as
much
upon
an
increase
in
moral
sensibility
as
it
does
upon
a
sense
of
duty
and
of
this
one
could
cite
many
illustrations
i
was
at
one
time
chairman
of
the
child
labor
committee
in
the
general
federation
of
woman
clubs
which
sent
out
a
schedule
asking
each
club
in
the
united
states
to
report
as
nearly
as
possible
all
the
working
children
under
fourteen
living
in
its
vicinity
a
florida
club
filled
out
the
schedule
with
an
astonishing
number
of
cuban
children
who
were
at
work
in
sugar
mills
and
the
club
members
registered
a
complaint
that
our
committee
had
sent
the
schedule
too
late
for
if
they
had
realized
the
conditions
earlier
they
might
have
presented
a
bill
to
the
legislature
which
had
now
adjourned
of
course
the
children
had
been
working
in
the
sugar
mills
for
years
and
had
probably
gone
back
and
forth
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
club
women
but
the
women
had
never
seen
them
much
less
felt
any
obligation
to
protect
them
until
they
joined
a
club
and
the
club
joined
a
federation
and
the
federation
appointed
a
child
labor
committee
who
sent
them
a
schedule
with
their
quickened
perceptions
they
then
saw
the
rescue
of
these
familiar
children
in
the
light
of
a
social
obligation
through
some
such
experiences
the
members
of
the
woman
club
have
obtained
the
power
of
seeing
the
concrete
through
the
general
and
have
entered
into
various
undertakings
very
early
in
its
history
the
club
formed
what
was
called
a
social
extension
committee
once
a
month
this
committee
gives
parties
to
people
in
the
neighborhood
who
for
any
reason
seem
forlorn
and
without
much
social
pleasure
one
evening
they
invited
only
italian
women
thereby
crossing
a
distinct
social
gulf
for
there
certainly
exists
as
great
a
sense
of
social
difference
between
the
prosperous
women
and
the
peasants
as
between
any
two
sets
of
people
in
the
city
of
chicago
the
italian
women
who
were
almost
eastern
in
their
habits
all
stayed
at
home
and
sent
their
husbands
and
the
social
extension
committee
entered
the
drawing
room
to
find
it
occupied
by
rows
of
italian
workingmen
who
seemed
to
prefer
to
sit
in
chairs
along
the
wall
they
were
quite
ready
to
be
socially
extended
but
plainly
puzzled
as
to
what
it
was
all
about
the
evening
finally
developed
into
a
very
successful
party
not
so
much
because
the
committee
were
equal
to
it
as
because
the
italian
men
rose
to
the
occasion
untiring
pairs
of
them
danced
the
tarantella
they
sang
neapolitan
songs
one
of
them
performed
some
of
those
wonderful
tricks
so
often
seen
on
the
streets
of
naples
they
explained
the
coral
finger
of
januarius
which
they
wore
they
politely
ate
the
strange
american
refreshments
and
when
the
evening
was
over
one
of
the
committee
said
to
me
do
you
know
i
am
ashamed
of
the
way
i
have
always
talked
about
they
are
quite
like
other
people
only
one
must
take
a
little
more
pains
with
them
i
have
been
nagging
my
husband
to
move
off
m
street
because
they
are
moving
in
but
i
am
going
to
try
staying
awhile
and
see
if
i
can
make
a
real
acquaintance
with
some
of
them
to
my
mind
at
that
moment
the
speaker
had
passed
from
the
region
of
the
uncultivated
person
into
the
possibilities
of
the
cultivated
person
the
former
is
bounded
by
a
narrow
outlook
on
life
unable
to
overcome
differences
of
dress
and
habit
and
his
interests
are
slowly
contracting
within
a
circumscribed
area
while
the
latter
constantly
tends
to
be
more
a
citizen
of
the
world
because
of
his
growing
understanding
of
all
kinds
of
people
with
their
varying
experiences
we
send
our
young
people
to
europe
that
they
may
lose
their
provincialism
and
be
able
to
judge
their
fellows
by
a
more
universal
test
as
we
send
them
to
college
that
they
may
attain
the
cultural
background
and
a
larger
outlook
all
of
these
it
is
possible
to
acquire
in
other
ways
as
this
member
of
the
woman
club
had
discovered
for
herself
this
social
extension
committee
under
the
leadership
of
an
of
the
club
a
resident
with
a
wide
acquaintance
also
discover
many
of
those
lonely
people
of
which
every
city
contains
so
large
a
number
we
are
only
slowly
apprehending
the
very
real
danger
to
the
individual
who
fails
to
establish
some
sort
of
genuine
relation
with
the
people
who
surround
him
we
are
all
more
or
less
familiar
with
the
results
of
isolation
in
rural
districts
the
bronte
sisters
have
portrayed
the
hideous
immorality
and
savagery
of
the
remote
dwellers
on
the
bleak
moorlands
of
northern
england
miss
wilkins
has
written
of
the
overdeveloped
will
of
the
solitary
new
englander
but
tales
still
wait
to
be
told
of
the
isolated
city
dweller
in
addition
to
the
lonely
young
man
recently
come
to
town
and
the
country
family
who
have
not
yet
made
their
connections
are
many
other
people
who
because
of
temperament
or
from
an
estimate
of
themselves
which
will
not
permit
them
to
make
friends
with
the
people
around
here
or
who
because
they
are
victims
to
a
combination
of
circumstances
lead
a
life
as
lonely
and
untouched
by
the
city
about
them
as
if
they
were
in
remote
country
districts
the
very
fact
that
it
requires
an
effort
to
preserve
isolation
from
the
life
which
flows
all
about
them
makes
the
character
stiffer
and
harsher
than
mere
country
solitude
could
do
many
instances
of
this
come
into
my
mind
the
faded
ladylike
hairdresser
who
came
and
went
to
her
work
for
twenty
years
carefully
concealing
her
dwelling
place
from
the
other
people
in
the
shop
moving
whenever
they
seemed
too
curious
about
it
and
priding
herself
that
no
neighbor
had
ever
stepped
inside
her
door
and
yet
when
discovered
through
an
asthma
which
forced
her
to
crave
friendly
offices
she
was
most
responsive
and
even
gay
in
a
social
atmosphere
another
woman
made
a
long
effort
to
conceal
the
poverty
resulting
from
her
husband
inveterate
gambling
and
to
secure
for
her
children
the
educational
advantages
to
which
her
family
had
always
been
accustomed
her
five
children
who
are
now
university
graduates
do
not
realize
how
hard
and
solitary
was
her
early
married
life
when
we
first
knew
her
and
she
was
beginning
to
regret
the
isolation
in
which
her
children
were
being
reared
for
she
saw
that
their
lack
of
early
companionship
would
always
cripple
their
power
to
make
friends
she
was
glad
to
avail
herself
of
the
social
resources
of
for
them
and
at
last
even
for
herself
the
leader
of
the
social
extension
committee
has
also
been
able
through
her
connection
with
the
vacant
lot
garden
movement
in
chicago
to
maintain
a
most
flourishing
friendly
club
largely
composed
of
people
who
cultivate
these
garden
plots
during
the
club
evening
at
least
they
regain
something
of
the
ease
of
the
man
who
is
being
estimated
by
the
bushels
per
acre
of
potatoes
he
has
raised
and
not
by
that
flimsy
city
judgment
so
often
based
upon
store
clothes
their
jollity
and
enthusiasm
are
unbounded
expressing
itself
in
clog
dances
and
rousing
old
songs
often
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
overworked
worn
aspects
of
the
members
of
course
there
are
surprising
possibilities
discovered
through
other
clubs
in
one
of
greek
women
or
in
the
circolo
italiano
for
a
social
club
often
affords
a
sheltered
space
in
which
the
gentler
social
usages
may
be
exercised
as
the
more
vigorous
clubs
afford
a
point
of
departure
into
larger
social
concerns
the
experiences
of
the
woman
club
constantly
react
upon
the
family
life
of
the
members
their
husbands
come
with
them
to
the
annual
midwinter
reception
to
club
concerts
and
entertainments
the
little
children
come
to
the
may
party
with
its
dancing
and
games
the
older
children
to
the
day
in
june
when
prizes
are
given
to
those
sons
and
daughters
of
the
members
who
present
a
good
school
record
as
graduates
either
from
the
eighth
grade
or
from
a
high
school
it
seemed
therefore
but
a
fit
recognition
of
their
efforts
when
the
president
of
the
club
erected
a
building
planned
especially
for
their
needs
with
their
own
library
and
a
hall
large
enough
for
their
various
social
undertakings
although
of
course
bowen
hall
is
constantly
put
to
many
other
uses
it
was
under
the
leadership
of
this
same
able
president
that
the
club
achieved
its
wider
purposes
and
took
its
place
with
the
other
forces
for
city
betterment
the
club
had
begun
as
nearly
all
women
clubs
do
upon
the
basis
of
although
the
foundations
for
this
later
development
had
been
laid
by
one
of
their
earliest
presidents
who
was
the
first
probation
officer
of
the
juvenile
court
and
who
had
so
shared
her
experiences
with
the
club
that
each
member
felt
the
truth
as
well
as
the
pathos
of
the
lines
inscribed
on
her
memorial
tablet
erected
in
their
club
library
as
more
exposed
to
suffering
and
distress
thence
also
more
alive
to
tenderness
each
woman
had
discovered
opportunities
in
her
own
experience
for
this
same
tender
understanding
and
under
its
succeeding
president
pelham
in
its
determination
to
be
of
use
to
the
needy
and
distressed
the
club
developed
many
philanthropic
undertakings
from
the
humble
beginnings
of
a
linen
chest
kept
constantly
filled
with
clothing
for
the
sick
and
poor
it
required
however
an
adequate
knowledge
of
adverse
city
conditions
so
productive
of
juvenile
delinquency
and
a
sympathy
which
could
enkindle
itself
in
many
others
of
divers
faiths
and
training
to
arouse
the
club
to
its
finest
public
spirit
this
was
done
by
a
later
president
bowen
who
as
head
of
the
juvenile
protective
association
had
learned
that
the
moralized
energy
of
a
group
is
best
fitted
to
cope
with
the
complicated
problems
of
a
city
but
it
required
ability
of
an
unusual
order
to
evoke
a
sense
of
social
obligation
from
the
very
knowledge
of
adverse
city
conditions
which
the
club
members
possessed
and
to
connect
it
with
the
many
civic
and
philanthropic
organizations
of
the
city
in
such
wise
as
to
make
it
socially
useful
this
financial
and
representative
connection
with
outside
organizations
is
valuable
to
the
club
only
as
it
expresses
its
sympathy
and
kindliness
at
the
same
time
in
concrete
form
a
group
of
members
who
lunch
with
bowen
each
week
at
discuss
not
only
topics
of
public
interest
sometimes
with
experts
whom
they
have
long
known
through
their
mutual
undertakings
but
also
their
own
club
affairs
in
the
light
of
this
larger
knowledge
thus
the
value
of
social
clubs
broadens
out
in
one
mind
to
an
instrument
of
companionship
through
which
many
may
be
led
from
a
sense
of
isolation
to
one
of
civic
responsibility
even
as
another
type
of
club
provides
recreational
facilities
for
those
who
have
had
only
meaningless
excitements
or
as
a
third
type
opens
new
and
interesting
vistas
of
life
to
those
who
are
ambitious
the
entire
organization
of
the
social
life
at
while
it
has
been
fostered
and
directed
by
residents
and
others
has
been
largely
pushed
and
vitalized
from
within
by
the
club
members
themselves
sir
walter
besant
once
told
me
that
stood
in
his
mind
more
nearly
for
the
ideal
of
the
palace
of
delight
than
did
the
london
people
palace
because
we
had
depended
upon
the
social
resources
of
the
people
using
it
he
begged
me
not
to
allow
to
become
too
educational
he
believed
it
much
easier
to
develop
a
polytechnic
institute
than
a
large
recreational
center
but
he
doubted
whether
the
former
was
as
useful
the
social
clubs
form
a
basis
of
acquaintanceship
for
many
people
living
in
other
parts
of
the
city
through
friendly
relations
with
individuals
which
is
perhaps
the
sanest
method
of
approach
they
are
thus
brought
into
contact
many
of
them
for
the
first
time
with
the
industrial
and
social
problems
challenging
the
moral
resources
of
our
contemporary
life
during
our
twenty
years
hundreds
of
these
have
directed
clubs
and
classes
and
have
increased
the
number
of
chicago
citizens
who
are
conversant
with
adverse
social
conditions
and
conscious
that
only
by
the
unceasing
devotion
of
each
according
to
his
strength
shall
the
compulsions
and
hardships
the
stupidities
and
cruelties
of
life
be
overcome
the
number
of
people
thus
informed
is
constantly
increasing
in
all
our
american
cities
and
they
may
in
time
remove
the
reproach
of
social
neglect
and
indifference
which
has
so
long
rested
upon
the
citizens
of
the
new
world
i
recall
the
experience
of
an
englishman
who
not
only
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
queen
cabinet
and
bore
a
title
but
also
because
he
was
an
able
statesman
was
entertained
with
great
enthusiasm
by
the
leading
citizens
of
chicago
at
a
large
dinner
party
he
asked
the
lady
sitting
next
to
him
what
our
legislation
was
in
regard
to
the
cubic
feet
of
air
required
for
each
occupant
of
a
tenement
bedroom
upon
her
disclaiming
any
knowledge
of
the
subject
the
inquiry
was
put
to
all
the
diners
at
the
long
table
all
of
whom
showed
surprise
that
they
should
be
expected
to
possess
this
information
in
telling
me
the
incident
afterward
the
english
guest
said
that
such
indifference
could
not
have
been
found
among
the
leading
citizens
of
london
whose
public
spirit
had
been
aroused
to
provide
such
housing
conditions
as
should
protect
tenement
dwellers
at
least
from
wanton
loss
of
vitality
and
lowered
industrial
efficiency
when
i
met
the
same
englishman
in
london
five
years
afterward
he
immediately
asked
me
whether
chicago
citizens
were
still
so
indifferent
to
the
conditions
of
the
poor
that
they
took
no
interest
in
their
proper
housing
i
was
quick
with
that
defense
which
an
american
is
obliged
to
use
so
often
in
europe
that
our
very
democracy
so
long
presupposed
that
each
citizen
could
care
for
himself
that
we
are
slow
to
develop
a
sense
of
social
obligation
he
smiled
at
the
familiar
phrases
and
was
still
inclined
to
attribute
our
indifference
to
sheer
ignorance
of
social
conditions
the
entire
social
development
of
is
so
unlike
what
i
predicted
twenty
years
ago
that
i
venture
to
quote
from
that
ancient
writing
as
an
end
to
this
chapter
the
social
organism
has
broken
down
through
large
districts
of
our
great
cities
many
of
the
people
living
there
are
very
poor
the
majority
of
them
without
leisure
or
energy
for
anything
but
the
gain
of
subsistence
they
live
for
the
moment
side
by
side
many
of
them
without
knowledge
of
each
other
without
fellowship
without
local
tradition
or
public
spirit
without
social
organization
of
any
kind
practically
nothing
is
done
to
remedy
this
the
people
who
might
do
it
who
have
the
social
tact
and
training
the
large
houses
and
the
traditions
and
customs
of
hospitality
live
in
other
parts
of
the
city
the
club
houses
libraries
galleries
and
conveniences
for
social
life
are
also
blocks
away
we
find
workingmen
organized
into
armies
of
producers
because
men
of
executive
ability
and
business
sagacity
have
found
it
to
their
interests
thus
to
organize
them
but
these
workingmen
are
not
organized
socially
although
lodging
in
crowded
tenement
houses
they
are
living
without
a
corresponding
social
contact
the
chaos
is
as
great
as
it
would
be
were
they
working
in
huge
factories
without
foremen
or
superintendent
their
ideas
and
resources
are
cramped
and
the
desire
for
higher
social
pleasure
becomes
extinct
they
have
no
share
in
the
traditions
and
social
energy
which
make
for
progress
too
often
their
only
place
of
meeting
is
a
saloon
their
only
host
a
bartender
a
local
demagogue
forms
their
public
opinion
men
of
ability
and
refinement
of
social
power
and
university
cultivation
stay
away
from
them
personally
i
believe
the
men
who
lose
most
are
those
who
thus
stay
away
but
the
paradox
is
here
when
cultivated
people
do
stay
away
from
a
certain
portion
of
the
population
when
all
social
advantages
are
persistently
withheld
it
may
be
for
years
the
result
itself
is
pointed
to
as
a
reason
and
is
used
as
an
argument
for
the
continued
withholding
it
is
constantly
said
that
because
the
masses
have
never
had
social
advantages
they
do
want
them
that
they
are
heavy
and
dull
and
that
it
will
take
political
or
philanthropic
machinery
to
change
them
this
divides
a
city
into
rich
and
poor
into
the
favored
who
express
their
sense
of
the
social
obligation
by
gifts
of
money
and
into
the
unfavored
who
express
it
by
clamoring
for
a
share
both
of
them
actuated
by
a
vague
sense
of
justice
this
division
of
the
city
would
be
more
justifiable
however
if
the
people
who
thus
isolate
themselves
on
certain
streets
and
use
their
social
ability
for
each
other
gained
enough
thereby
and
added
sufficient
to
the
sum
total
of
social
progress
to
justify
the
withholding
of
the
pleasures
and
results
of
that
progress
from
so
many
people
who
ought
to
have
them
but
they
can
not
accomplish
this
for
the
social
spirit
discharges
itself
in
many
forms
and
no
one
form
is
adequate
to
its
total
expression

an

well
lighted
for
day
and
evening
use
and
our
first
exhibit
of
loaned
pictures
was
opened
in
june
by
and
barnett
of
london
it
is
always
pleasant
to
associate
their
hearty
sympathy
with
that
first
exhibit
and
thus
to
connect
it
with
their
pioneer
efforts
at
toynbee
hall
to
secure
for
working
people
the
opportunity
to
know
the
best
art
and
with
their
establishment
of
the
first
permanent
art
gallery
in
an
industrial
quarter
we
took
pride
in
the
fact
that
our
first
exhibit
contained
some
of
the
best
pictures
chicago
afforded
and
we
conscientiously
insured
them
against
fire
and
carefully
guarded
them
by
night
and
day
we
had
five
of
these
exhibits
during
two
years
after
the
gallery
was
completed
two
of
oil
paintings
one
of
old
engravings
and
etchings
one
of
water
colors
and
one
of
pictures
especially
selected
for
use
in
the
public
schools
these
exhibits
were
surprisingly
well
attended
and
thousands
of
votes
were
cast
for
the
most
popular
pictures
their
value
to
the
neighborhood
of
course
had
to
be
determined
by
each
one
of
us
according
to
the
value
he
attached
to
beauty
and
the
escape
it
offers
from
dreary
reality
into
the
realm
of
the
imagination
miss
starr
always
insisted
that
the
arts
should
receive
adequate
recognition
at
and
urged
that
one
must
always
remember
the
hungry
individual
soul
which
without
art
will
have
passed
unsolaced
and
unfed
followed
by
other
souls
who
lack
the
impulse

have
given

exhibits

evidence
that
the
older
immigrants
do
not
expect
the
solace
of
art
in
this
country
an
italian
expressed
great
surprise
when
he
found
that
we
although
americans
still
liked
pictures
and
said
quite
naively
that
he
did
know
that
americans
cared
for
anything
but
dollars
that
looking
at
pictures
was
something
people
only
did
in
italy
the
extreme
isolation
of
the
italian
colony
was
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
public
art
gallery
in
the
city
nor
any
houses
in
which
pictures
were
regarded
as
treasures
a
greek
was
much
surprised
to
see
a
photograph
of
the
acropolis
at
because
he
had
lived
in
chicago
for
thirteen
years
and
had
never
before
met
any
americans
who
knew
about
this
foremost
glory
of
the
world
before
he
left
greece
he
had
imagined
that
americans
would
be
most
eager
to
see
pictures
of
athens
and
as
he
was
a
graduate
of
a
school
of
technology
he
had
prepared
a
book
of
colored
drawings
and
had
made
a
collection
of
photographs
which
he
was
sure
americans
would
enjoy
but
although
from
his
fruit
stand
near
one
of
the
large
railroad
stations
he
had
conversed
with
many
americans
and
had
often
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
back
to
ancient
greece
no
one
had
responded
and
he
had
at
last
concluded
that
the
people
of
chicago
knew
nothing
of
ancient
times
the
loan
exhibits
were
continued
until
the
chicago
art
institute
was
opened
free
to
the
public
on
sunday
afternoons
and
parties
were
arranged
at
and
conducted
there
by
a
guide
in
time
even
these
parties
were
discontinued
as
the
galleries
became
better
known
in
all
parts
of
the
city
and
the
art
institute
management
did
much
to
make
pictures
popular
from
the
first
a
studio
was
maintained
at
which
has
developed
through
the
changing
years
under
the
direction
of
miss
benedict
one
of
the
residents
who
is
a
member
of
the
faculty
in
the
art
institute
buildings
on
the
quadrangle
furnish
studios
for
artists
who
find
something
of
the
same
spirit
in
the
contiguous
italian
colony
that
the
french
artist
is
traditionally
supposed
to
discover
in
his
beloved
latin
quarter
these
artists
uncover
something
of
the
picturesque
in
the
foreign
colonies
which
they
have
reproduced
in
painting
etching
and
lithography
they
find
their
classes
filled
not
only
by
young
people
possessing
facility
and
sometimes
talent
but
also
by
older
people
to
whom
the
studio
affords
the
one
opportunity
of
escape
from
dreariness
a
widow
with
four
children
who
supplemented
a
very
inadequate
income
by
teaching
the
piano
for
six
years
never
missed
her
weekly
painting
lesson
because
it
was
her
one
pleasure
another
woman
whose
youth
and
strength
had
gone
into
the
care
of
an
invalid
father
poured
into
her
afternoon
in
the
studio
once
a
week
all
of
the
longing
for
which
she
habitually
suppressed
perhaps
the
most
satisfactory
results
of
the
studio
have
been
obtained
through
the
classes
of
young
men
who
are
engaged
in
the
commercial
arts
and
who
are
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
work
out
their
own
ideas
this
is
true
of
young
engravers
and
lithographers
of
the
men
who
have
to
do
with
posters
and
illustrations
in
various
ways
the
little
pile
of
stones
and
the
lithographer
handpress
in
a
corner
of
the
studio
have
been
used
in
many
an
experiment
as
has
a
set
of
beautiful
type
loaned
to
by
a
bibliophile
the
work
of
the
studio
almost
imperceptibly
merged
into
the
crafts
and
well
within
the
first
decade
a
shop
was
opened
at
under
the
direction
of
several
residents
who
were
also
members
of
the
chicago
arts
and
crafts
society
this
shop
is
not
merely
a
school
where
people
are
taught
and
then
sent
forth
to
use
their
teaching
in
art
according
to
their
individual
initiative
and
opportunity
but
where
those
who
have
already
been
carefully
trained
may
express
the
best
they
can
in
wood
or
metal
the
settlement
soon
discovers
how
difficult
it
is
to
put
a
fringe
of
art
on
the
end
of
a
day
spent
in
a
factory
we
constantly
see
young
people
doing
overhurried
work
wrapping
bars
of
soap
in
pieces
of
paper
might
at
least
give
the
pleasure
of
accuracy
and
repetition
if
it
could
be
done
at
a
normal
pace
but
when
paid
for
by
the
piece
speed
becomes
the
sole
requirement
and
the
last
suggestion
of
human
interest
is
taken
away
in
contrast
to
this
the
shop
affords
many
examples
of
the
restorative
power
in
the
exercise
of
a
genuine
craft
a
young
russian
who
like
too
many
of
his
countrymen
had
made
a
desperate
effort
to
fit
himself
for
a
learned
profession
and
who
had
almost
finished
his
course
in
a
night
law
school
used
to
watch
constantly
the
work
being
done
in
the
metal
shop
at
one
evening
in
a
moment
of
sudden
resolve
he
took
off
his
coat
sat
down
at
one
of
the
benches
and
began
to
work
obviously
as
a
very
clever
silversmith
he
had
long
concealed
his
craft
because
he
thought
it
would
hurt
his
efforts
as
a
lawyer
and
because
he
imagined
an
office
more
honorable
and
more
american
than
a
shop
as
he
worked
on
during
his
two
leisure
evenings
each
week
his
entire
bearing
and
conversation
registered
the
relief
of
one
who
abandons
the
effort
he
is
not
fitted
for
and
becomes
a
man
on
his
own
feet
expressing
himself
through
a
familiar
and
delicate
technique
miss
starr
at
length
found
herself
quite
impatient
with
her
role
of
lecturer
on
the
arts
while
all
the
handicraft
about
her
was
untouched
by
beauty
and
did
not
even
reflect
the
interest
of
the
workman
she
took
a
training
in
bookbinding
in
london
under
and
established
her
bindery
at
in
which
design
and
workmanship
beauty
and
thoroughness
are
taught
to
a
small
number
of
apprentices
from
the
very
first
winter
concerts
which
are
still
continued
were
given
every
sunday
afternoon
in
the
and
later
as
the
audiences
increased
in
the
larger
halls
for
these
we
are
indebted
to
musicians
from
every
part
of
the
city
william
tomlins
early
trained
large
choruses
of
adults
as
his
assistants
did
of
children
and
the
response
to
all
of
these
showed
that
while
the
number
of
people
in
our
vicinity
caring
for
the
best
music
was
not
large
they
constituted
a
steady
and
appreciative
group
it
was
in
connection
with
these
first
choruses
that
a
citizen
of
chicago
offered
a
prize
for
the
best
labor
song
competition
to
be
open
to
the
entire
country
the
responses
to
the
offer
literally
filled
three
large
barrels
and
speaking
at
least
for
myself
as
one
of
the
bewildered
judges
we
were
more
disheartened
by
their
quality
than
even
by
their
overwhelming
bulk
apparently
the
workers
of
america
are
not
yet
ready
to
sing
although
i
recall
a
creditable
chorus
trained
at
for
a
large
meeting
in
sympathy
with
the
anthracite
coal
strike
in
which
the
swinging
lines
who
was
it
made
the
coal
our
god
as
well
as
theirs
seemed
to
relieve
the
tension
of
the
moment
miss
eleanor
smith
the
head
of
the
music
school
who
had
put
the
words
to
music
performed
the
same
office
for
the
sweatshop
of
the
yiddish
poet
the
translation
of
which
presents
so
graphically
the
bewilderment
and
tedium
of
the
new
york
shop
that
it
might
be
applied
to
almost
any
other
machinery
industry
as
the
first
verse
indicates
the
roaring
of
the
wheels
has
filled
my
ears
the
clashing
and
the
clamor
shut
me
in
myself
my
soul
in
chaos
disappears
i
can
not
think
or
feel
amid
the
din
it
may
be
that
this
plaint
explains
the
lack
of
labor
songs
in
this
period
of
industrial
maladjustment
when
the
worker
is
overmastered
by
his
very
tools
in
addition
to
sharing
with
our
neighborhood
the
best
music
we
could
procure
we
have
conscientiously
provided
careful
musical
instruction
that
at
least
a
few
young
people
might
understand
those
old
usages
of
art
that
they
might
master
its
trade
secrets
for
after
all
it
is
only
through
a
careful
technique
that
artistic
ability
can
express
itself
and
be
preserved
from
the
beginning
we
had
classes
in
music
and
the
music
school
which
is
housed
in
quarters
of
its
own
in
our
quieter
court
was
opened
in
the
school
is
designed
to
give
a
thorough
musical
instruction
to
a
limited
number
of
children
from
the
first
lessons
they
are
taught
to
compose
and
to
reduce
to
order
the
musical
suggestions
which
may
come
to
them
and
in
this
wise
the
school
has
sometimes
been
able
to
recover
the
songs
of
the
immigrants
through
their
children
some
of
these
folk
songs
have
never
been
committed
to
paper
but
have
survived
through
the
centuries
because
of
a
touch
of
undying
poetry
which
the
world
has
always
cherished
as
in
the
song
of
a
russian
who
is
digging
a
post
hole
and
finds
his
task
dull
and
difficult
until
he
strikes
a
stratum
of
red
sand
which
in
addition
to
making
digging
easy
reminds
him
of
the
red
hair
of
his
sweetheart
and
all
goes
merrily
as
the
song
lifts
into
a
joyous
melody
i
recall
again
the
almost
hilarious
enjoyment
of
the
adult
audience
to
whom
it
was
sung
by
the
children
who
had
revived
it
as
well
as
the
more
sober
appreciation
of
the
hymns
taken
from
the
lips
of
the
cantor
whose
father
before
him
had
officiated
in
the
synagogue
the
recitals
and
concerts
given
by
the
school
are
attended
by
large
and
appreciative
audiences
on
the
sunday
before
christmas
the
program
of
christmas
songs
draws
together
people
of
the
most
diverging
faiths
in
the
deep
tones
of
the
memorial
organ
erected
at
we
realize
that
music
is
perhaps
the
most
potent
agent
for
making
the
universal
appeal
and
inducing
men
to
forget
their
differences
some
of
the
pupils
in
the
music
school
have
developed
during
the
years
into
trained
musicians
and
are
supporting
themselves
in
their
chosen
profession
on
the
other
hand
we
constantly
see
the
most
promising
musical
ability
extinguished
when
the
young
people
enter
industries
which
so
sap
their
vitality
that
they
can
not
carry
on
serious
study
in
the
scanty
hours
outside
of
factory
work
many
cases
indisputably
illustrate
this
a
bohemian
girl
who
in
order
to
earn
money
for
pressing
family
needs
first
ruined
her
voice
in
a
six
months
constant
vaudeville
engagement
returned
to
her
trade
working
overtime
in
a
vain
effort
to
continue
the
vaudeville
income
another
young
girl
whom
had
sent
to
the
high
school
so
long
as
her
parents
consented
because
we
realized
that
a
beautiful
voice
is
often
unavailable
through
lack
of
the
informing
mind
later
extinguished
her
promise
in
a
tobacco
factory
a
third
girl
who
had
supported
her
little
sisters
since
she
was
fourteen
eagerly
used
her
fine
voice
for
earning
money
at
entertainments
held
late
after
her
day
work
until
exposure
and
fatigue
ruined
her
health
as
well
as
a
musician
future
a
young
man
whose
family
gave
him
every
possible
opportunity
and
who
produced
some
charming
and
even
joyous
songs
during
the
long
struggle
with
tuberculosis
which
preceded
his
death
had
made
a
brave
beginning
not
only
as
a
teacher
of
music
but
as
a
composer
in
the
little
service
held
at
in
his
memory
when
the
children
sang
his
composition
how
sweet
is
the
shepherd
sweet
lot
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
such
an
interpretive
pastoral
could
have
been
produced
by
one
whose
childhood
had
been
passed
in
a
crowded
city
quarter
even
that
bitter
experience
did
not
prepare
us
for
the
sorrowful
year
when
six
promising
pupils
out
of
a
class
of
fifteen
developed
tuberculosis
it
required
but
little
penetration
to
see
that
during
the
eight
years
the
class
of
fifteen
school
children
had
come
together
to
the
music
school
they
had
approximately
an
even
chance
but
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
legal
working
age
only
a
scanty
moiety
of
those
who
became
could
endure
the
strain
of
long
hours
and
bad
air
thus
the
average
human
youth
with
all
the
sweetness
of
the
common
dawn
is
flung
into
the
vortex
of
industrial
life
wherein
the
everyday
tragedy
escapes
us
save
when
one
of
them
becomes
conspicuously
unfortunate
twice
in
one
year
we
were
compelled
to
find
the
inheritance
of
this
poor
child
his
little
kingdom
of
a
forced
grave
it
has
been
pointed
out
many
times
that
art
lives
by
devouring
her
own
offspring
and
the
world
has
come
to
justify
even
that
sacrifice
but
we
are
unfortified
and
unsolaced
when
we
see
the
children
of
art
devoured
not
by
her
but
by
the
uncouth
stranger
modern
industry
who
needlessly
ruthless
and
brutal
to
her
own
children
is
quickly
fatal
to
the
offspring
of
the
gentler
mother
and
so
schools
in
art
for
those
who
go
to
work
at
the
age
when
more
fortunate
young
people
are
still
sheltered
and
educated
constantly
epitomize
one
of
the
haunting
problems
of
life
why
do
we
permit
the
waste
of
this
most
precious
human
faculty
this
consummate
possession
of
civilization
when
we
fail
to
provide
the
vessel
in
which
it
may
be
treasured
it
runs
out
upon
the
ground
and
is
irretrievably
lost
the
universal
desire
for
the
portrayal
of
life
lying
quite
outside
of
personal
experience
evinces
itself
in
many
forms
one
of
the
conspicuous
features
of
our
neighborhood
as
of
all
industrial
quarters
is
the
persistency
with
which
the
entire
population
attends
the
theater
the
very
first
day
i
saw
halsted
street
a
long
line
of
young
men
and
boys
stood
outside
the
gallery
entrance
of
the
bijou
theater
waiting
for
the
sunday
matinee
to
begin
at
two
although
it
was
only
high
noon
this
waiting
crowd
might
have
been
seen
every
sunday
afternoon
during
the
twenty
years
which
have
elapsed
since
then
our
first
sunday
evening
in
when
a
group
of
small
boys
sat
on
our
piazza
and
told
us
about
things
around
here
their
talk
was
all
of
the
theater
and
of
the
astonishing
things
they
had
seen
that
afternoon
but
quite
as
it
was
difficult
to
discover
the
habits
and
purposes
of
this
group
of
boys
because
they
much
preferred
talking
about
the
theater
to
contemplating
their
own
lives
so
it
was
all
along
the
line
the
young
men
told
us
their
ambitions
in
the
phrases
of
stage
heroes
and
the
girls
so
far
as
their
romantic
dreams
could
be
shyly
put
into
words
possessed
no
others
but
those
soiled
by
long
use
in
the
melodrama
all
of
these
young
people
looked
upon
an
afternoon
a
week
in
the
gallery
of
a
halsted
street
theater
as
their
one
opportunity
to
see
life
the
sort
of
melodrama
they
see
there
has
recently
been
described
as
the
ten
commandments
written
in
red
fire
certainly
the
villain
always
comes
to
a
violent
end
and
the
young
and
handsome
hero
is
rewarded
by
marriage
with
a
beautiful
girl
usually
the
daughter
of
a
millionaire
but
after
all
that
is
not
a
portrayal
of
the
morality
of
the
ten
commandments
any
more
than
of
life
itself
nevertheless
the
theater
such
as
it
was
appeared
to
be
the
one
agency
which
freed
the
boys
and
girls
from
that
destructive
isolation
of
those
who
drag
themselves
up
to
maturity
by
themselves
and
it
gave
them
a
glimpse
of
that
order
and
beauty
into
which
even
the
poorest
drama
endeavors
to
restore
the
bewildering
facts
of
life
the
most
prosaic
young
people
bear
testimony
to
this
overmastering
desire
a
striking
illustration
of
this
came
to
us
during
our
second
year
residence
on
halsted
street
through
an
incident
in
the
italian
colony
where
the
men
have
always
boasted
that
they
were
able
to
guard
their
daughters
from
the
dangers
of
city
life
and
until
evil
italians
entered
the
business
of
the
white
slave
traffic
their
boast
was
well
founded
the
first
italian
girl
to
go
astray
known
to
the
residents
of
was
so
fascinated
by
the
stage
that
on
her
way
home
from
work
she
always
loitered
outside
a
theater
before
the
enticing
posters
three
months
after
her
elopement
with
an
actor
her
distracted
mother
received
a
picture
of
her
dressed
in
the
men
clothes
in
which
she
appeared
in
vaudeville
her
family
mourned
her
as
dead
and
her
name
was
never
mentioned
among
them
nor
in
the
entire
colony
in
further
illustration
of
an
overmastering
desire
to
see
life
as
portrayed
on
the
stage
are
two
young
girls
whose
sober
parents
did
not
approve
of
the
theater
and
would
allow
no
money
for
such
foolish
purposes
in
sheer
desperation
the
sisters
evolved
a
plot
that
one
of
them
would
feign
a
toothache
and
while
she
was
having
her
tooth
pulled
by
a
neighboring
dentist
the
other
would
steal
the
gold
crowns
from
his
table
and
with
the
money
thus
procured
they
could
attend
the
vaudeville
theater
every
night
on
their
way
home
from
work
apparently
the
pain
and
wrongdoing
did
not
weigh
for
a
moment
against
the
anticipated
pleasure
the
plan
was
carried
out
to
the
point
of
selling
the
gold
crowns
to
a
pawnbroker
when
the
disappointed
girls
were
arrested
all
this
effort
to
see
the
play
took
place
in
the
years
before
the
theaters
had
become
a
feature
of
every
crowded
city
thoroughfare
and
before
their
popularity
had
induced
the
attendance
of
two
and
a
quarter
million
people
in
the
united
states
every
hours
the
eagerness
of
the
penniless
children
to
get
into
these
magic
spaces
is
responsible
for
an
entire
crop
of
petty
crimes
made
more
easy
because
two
children
are
admitted
for
one
nickel
at
the
last
performance
when
the
hour
is
late
and
the
theater
nearly
deserted
the
residents
were
aghast
at
the
early
popularity
of
these
mimic
shows
and
in
the
days
before
the
inspection
of
films
and
the
present
regulations
for
the
theaters
we
established
at
a
moving
picture
show
although
its
success
justified
its
existence
it
was
so
obviously
but
one
in
the
midst
of
hundreds
that
it
seemed
much
more
advisable
to
turn
our
attention
to
the
improvement
of
all
of
them
or
rather
to
assist
as
best
we
could
the
successful
efforts
in
this
direction
by
the
juvenile
protective
association
however
long
before
the
theater
was
even
heard
of
we
had
accumulated
much
testimony
as
to
the
power
of
the
drama
and
we
would
have
been
dull
indeed
if
we
had
not
availed
ourselves
of
the
use
of
the
play
at
not
only
as
an
agent
of
recreation
and
education
but
as
a
vehicle
of
for
the
teeming
young
life
all
about
us
long
before
the
theater
was
built
we
had
many
plays
first
in
the
and
later
in
the
gymnasium
the
young
people
clubs
never
tired
of
rehearsing
and
preparing
for
these
dramatic
occasions
and
we
also
discovered
that
older
people
were
almost
equally
ready
and
talented
we
quickly
learned
that
no
celebration
at
thanksgiving
was
so
popular
as
a
graphic
portrayal
on
the
stage
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
we
were
often
put
to
it
to
reduce
to
dramatic
effects
the
great
days
of
patriotism
and
religion
at
one
of
our
early
christmas
celebrations
longfellow
golden
legend
was
given
the
actors
portraying
it
with
the
touch
of
the
miracle
play
spirit
which
it
reflects
i
remember
an
old
blind
man
who
took
the
part
of
a
shepherd
said
at
the
end
of
the
last
performance
kind
heart
a
name
by
which
he
always
addressed
me
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
been
waiting
all
my
life
to
hear
some
of
these
things
said
i
am
glad
we
had
so
many
performances
for
i
think
i
can
remember
them
to
the
end
it
is
getting
hard
for
me
to
listen
to
reading
but
the
different
voices
and
all
made
this
very
plain
had
he
not
perhaps
made
a
legitimate
demand
upon
the
drama
that
it
shall
express
for
us
that
which
we
have
not
been
able
to
formulate
for
ourselves
that
it
shall
warm
us
with
a
sense
of
companionship
with
the
experiences
of
others
does
not
every
genuine
drama
present
our
relations
to
each
other
and
to
the
world
in
which
we
find
ourselves
in
such
wise
as
may
fortify
us
to
the
end
of
the
journey
the
immigrants
in
the
neighborhood
of
have
utilized
our
little
stage
in
an
endeavor
to
reproduce
the
past
of
their
own
nations
through
those
immortal
dramas
which
have
escaped
from
the
restraining
bond
of
one
country
into
the
land
of
the
universal
a
large
colony
of
greeks
near
who
often
feel
that
their
history
and
classic
background
are
completely
ignored
by
americans
and
that
they
are
easily
confused
with
the
more
ignorant
immigrants
from
other
parts
of
southeastern
europe
welcome
an
occasion
to
present
greek
plays
in
the
ancient
text
with
expert
help
in
the
difficulties
of
staging
and
rehearsing
a
classic
play
they
reproduced
the
ajax
of
sophocles
upon
the
stage
it
was
a
genuine
triumph
to
the
actors
who
felt
that
they
were
showing
forth
the
glory
of
greece
to
ignorant
americans
the
scholar
who
came
with
a
copy
of
sophocles
in
hand
and
followed
the
play
with
real
enjoyment
did
not
in
the
least
realize
that
the
revelation
of
the
love
of
greek
poets
was
mutual
between
the
audience
and
the
actors
the
greeks
have
quite
recently
assisted
an
enthusiast
in
producing
electra
while
the
lithuanians
the
poles
and
other
russian
subjects
often
use
the
stage
to
present
plays
in
their
own
tongue
which
shall
at
one
and
the
same
time
keep
alive
their
sense
of
participation
in
the
great
russian
revolution
and
relieve
their
feelings
in
regard
to
it
there
is
something
still
more
appealing
in
the
yearning
efforts
the
immigrants
sometimes
make
to
formulate
their
situation
in
america
i
recall
a
play
written
by
an
italian
playwright
of
our
neighborhood
which
depicted
the
insolent
break
between
americanized
sons
and
old
country
parents
so
touchingly
that
it
moved
to
tears
all
the
older
italians
in
the
audience
did
the
tears
of
each
express
relief
in
finding
that
others
had
had
the
same
experience
as
himself
and
did
the
knowledge
free
each
one
from
a
sense
of
isolation
and
an
injured
belief
that
his
children
were
the
worst
of
all
this
effort
to
understand
life
through
its
dramatic
portrayal
to
see
one
own
participation
intelligibly
set
forth
becomes
difficult
when
one
enters
the
field
of
social
development
but
even
here
it
is
not
impossible
if
a
settlement
group
is
constantly
searching
for
new
material
a
labor
story
appearing
in
the
atlantic
monthly
was
kindly
dramatized
for
us
by
the
author
who
also
superintended
its
presentation
upon
the
stage
the
little
drama
presented
the
untutored
effort
of
a
man
to
secure
for
his
side
the
beauty
of
the
glamour
of
martyrdom
which
so
often
seems
to
belong
solely
to
the
nonunion
forces
the
presentation
of
the
play
was
attended
by
an
audience
of
and
employers
and
those
other
people
who
are
supposed
to
make
public
opinion
together
they
felt
the
moral
beauty
of
the
man
conclusion
that
it
the
side
that
suffers
most
that
will
win
out
in
this
war
the
saints
is
the
only
ones
that
has
got
the
world
under
their
feet
we
got
to
do
the
way
they
done
if
the
unions
is
to
stand
so
completely
that
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
he
should
forfeit
his
life
upon
the
truth
of
this
statement
the
dramatic
arts
have
gradually
been
developed
at
through
amateur
companies
one
of
which
has
held
together
for
more
than
fifteen
years
the
members
were
originally
selected
from
the
young
people
who
had
evinced
talent
in
the
plays
the
social
clubs
were
always
giving
but
the
association
now
adds
to
itself
only
as
a
vacancy
occurs
some
of
them
have
developed
almost
a
professional
ability
although
contrary
to
all
predictions
and
in
spite
of
several
offers
none
of
them
have
taken
to
a
stage
career
they
present
all
sorts
of
plays
from
melodrama
and
comedy
to
those
of
shaw
ibsen
and
galsworthy
the
latter
are
surprisingly
popular
perhaps
because
of
their
sincere
attempt
to
expose
the
shams
and
pretenses
of
contemporary
life
and
to
penetrate
into
some
of
its
perplexing
social
and
domestic
situations
through
such
plays
the
stage
may
become
a
pioneer
teacher
of
social
righteousness
i
have
come
to
believe
however
that
the
stage
may
do
more
than
teach
that
much
of
our
current
moral
instruction
will
not
endure
the
test
of
being
cast
into
a
lifelike
mold
and
when
presented
in
dramatic
form
will
reveal
itself
as
platitudinous
and
effete
that
which
may
have
sounded
like
righteous
teaching
when
it
was
remote
and
wordy
will
be
challenged
afresh
when
it
is
obliged
to
simulate
life
itself
this
function
of
the
stage
as
a
reconstructing
and
reorganizing
agent
of
accepted
moral
truths
came
to
me
with
overwhelming
force
as
i
listened
to
the
passion
play
at
oberammergau
one
beautiful
summer
day
in
the
peasants
who
portrayed
exactly
the
successive
scenes
of
the
wonderful
life
who
used
only
the
very
words
found
in
the
accepted
version
of
the
gospels
yet
curiously
modernized
and
reorientated
the
message
they
made
clear
that
the
opposition
to
the
young
teacher
sprang
from
the
merchants
whose
traffic
in
the
temple
he
had
disturbed
and
from
the
pharisees
who
were
dependent
upon
them
for
support
their
query
was
curiously
familiar
as
they
demanded
the
antecedents
of
the
radical
who
dared
to
touch
vested
interests
who
presumed
to
dictate
the
morality
of
trade
and
who
insulted
the
marts
of
honest
merchants
by
calling
them
a
den
of
thieves
as
the
play
developed
it
became
clear
that
this
powerful
opposition
had
friends
in
church
and
state
that
they
controlled
influences
which
ramified
in
all
directions
they
obviously
believed
in
their
statement
of
the
case
and
their
very
wealth
and
position
in
the
community
gave
their
words
such
weight
that
finally
all
of
their
hearers
were
convinced
that
the
young
agitator
must
be
done
away
with
in
order
that
the
highest
interests
of
society
might
be
conserved
these
simple
peasants
made
it
clear
that
it
was
the
money
power
which
induced
one
of
the
agitator
closest
friends
to
betray
him
and
the
villain
of
the
piece
judas
himself
was
only
a
man
who
was
so
dazzled
by
money
so
under
the
domination
of
all
it
represented
that
he
was
perpetually
blind
to
the
spiritual
vision
unrolling
before
him
as
i
sat
through
the
long
summer
day
seeing
the
shadows
on
the
beautiful
mountain
back
of
the
open
stage
shift
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
finally
grow
long
and
pointed
in
the
soft
evening
light
my
mind
was
filled
with
perplexing
questions
did
the
dramatization
of
the
life
of
jesus
set
forth
its
meaning
more
clearly
and
conclusively
than
talking
and
preaching
could
possibly
do
as
a
shadowy
following
of
the
command
to
do
the
will
the
peasant
actors
whom
i
had
seen
returning
from
mass
that
morning
had
prayed
only
to
portray
the
life
as
he
had
lived
it
and
behold
out
of
their
simplicity
and
piety
arose
this
modern
version
which
even
harnack
was
only
then
venturing
to
suggest
to
his
advanced
colleagues
in
berlin
yet
the
oberammergau
fold
were
very
like
thousands
of
immigrant
men
and
women
of
chicago
both
in
their
experiences
and
in
their
familiarity
with
the
hard
facts
of
life
and
throughout
that
day
as
my
mind
dwelt
on
my
neighbors
i
was
reproached
with
the
sense
of
an
ungarnered
harvest
of
course
such
a
generally
uplifted
state
comes
only
at
rare
moments
while
the
development
of
the
little
theater
at
has
not
depended
upon
the
moods
of
any
one
but
upon
the
genuine
enthusiasm
and
sustained
effort
of
a
group
of
residents
several
of
them
artists
who
have
ungrudgingly
given
their
time
to
it
year
after
year
this
group
has
long
fostered
junior
dramatic
associations
through
which
it
seems
possible
to
give
a
training
in
manners
and
morals
more
directly
than
through
any
other
medium
they
have
learned
to
determine
very
cleverly
the
ages
at
which
various
types
of
the
drama
are
most
congruous
and
expressive
of
the
sentiments
of
the
little
troupes
from
the
fairy
plays
such
as
and
which
appeal
to
the
youngest
children
to
the
heroic
plays
of
william
tell
king
john
and
wat
tyler
for
the
older
lads
and
to
the
romances
and
comedies
which
set
forth
in
stately
fashion
the
elaborated
life
which
so
many
young
people
admire
a
group
of
jewish
boys
gave
a
dramatic
version
of
the
story
of
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
again
of
queen
esther
they
had
almost
a
sense
of
proprietorship
in
the
fine
old
lines
and
were
pleased
to
bring
from
home
bits
of
talmudic
lore
for
the
stage
setting
the
same
club
of
boys
at
one
time
will
buoyantly
give
a
roaring
comedy
and
five
years
later
will
solemnly
demand
a
drama
dealing
with
modern
industrial
conditions
the
theater
is
also
rented
from
time
to
time
to
members
of
the
young
people
socialist
league
who
give
plays
both
in
yiddish
and
english
which
reduce
their
propaganda
to
conversation
through
such
humble
experiments
as
the
stage
as
well
as
through
the
more
ambitious
reforms
which
are
attempted
in
various
parts
of
the
country
the
theatre
may
at
last
be
restored
to
its
rightful
place
in
the
community
there
have
been
times
when
our
little
stage
was
able
to
serve
the
theatre
libre
a
chicago
troupe
finding
it
difficult
to
break
into
a
trust
theater
used
it
one
winter
twice
a
week
for
the
presentation
of
ibsen
and
old
french
comedy
a
visit
from
the
irish
poet
yeats
inspired
us
to
do
our
share
towards
freeing
the
stage
from
its
slavery
to
expensive
scene
setting
and
a
forest
of
stiff
conventional
trees
against
a
gilt
sky
still
remains
with
us
as
a
reminder
of
an
attempt
not
wholly
unsuccessful
in
this
direction
this
group
of
artists
have
filled
our
little
foyer
with
a
series
of
charming
playbills
and
by
dint
of
painting
their
own
scenery
and
making
their
own
costumes
have
obtained
beguiling
results
in
stage
setting
sometimes
all
the
artistic
resources
of
the
house
unite
in
a
wagnerian
combination
thus
the
text
of
the
troll
holiday
was
written
by
one
resident
set
to
music
by
another
sung
by
the
music
school
and
placed
upon
the
stage
under
the
careful
direction
and
training
of
the
dramatic
committee
and
the
little
brown
trolls
could
never
have
tumbled
about
so
gracefully
in
their
gleaming
caves
unless
they
had
been
taught
in
the
gymnasium
some
such
synthesis
takes
place
every
year
at
the
annual
exhibition
when
an
effort
is
made
to
bring
together
in
a
spirit
of
holiday
the
nine
thousand
people
who
come
to
the
house
every
week
during
duller
times
curiously
enough
the
central
feature
at
the
annual
exhibition
seems
to
be
the
brass
band
of
the
boys
club
which
apparently
dominates
the
situation
by
sheer
size
and
noise
but
perhaps
their
fresh
boyish
enthusiasm
expresses
that
which
the
older
people
take
more
soberly
as
the
stage
of
our
little
theater
had
attempted
to
portray
the
heroes
of
many
lands
so
we
planned
one
early
spring
seven
years
ago
to
carry
out
a
scheme
of
mural
decoration
upon
the
walls
of
the
theater
itself
which
should
portray
those
cosmopolitan
heroes
who
have
become
great
through
identification
with
the
common
lot
in
preference
to
the
heroes
of
mere
achievement
in
addition
to
the
group
of
artists
living
at
several
others
were
in
temporary
residence
and
they
all
threw
themselves
enthusiastically
into
the
plan
the
series
began
with
tolstoy
plowing
his
field
which
was
painted
by
an
artist
of
the
glasgow
school
and
the
next
was
of
the
young
lincoln
pushing
his
flatboat
down
the
mississippi
river
at
the
moment
he
received
his
first
impression
of
the
great
iniquity
this
was
done
by
a
promising
young
artist
of
chicago
and
the
wall
spaces
nearest
to
the
two
selected
heroes
were
quickly
filled
with
their
immortal
sayings
a
spirited
discussion
thereupon
ensued
in
regard
to
the
heroes
for
the
two
remaining
large
wall
spaces
when
to
the
surprise
of
all
of
us
the
group
of
residents
who
had
lived
in
unbroken
harmony
for
more
than
ten
years
suddenly
broke
up
into
cults
and
even
camps
of
hero

such
enthusiastic
following
from
our
cosmopolitan
neighborhood
that
it
was
certain
to
give
offense
if
any
two
were
selected
then
there
was
the
cult
of
residents
who
wished
to
keep
the
series
contemporaneous
with
the
two
heroes
already
painted
and
they
advocated
william
morris
at
his
loom
walt
whitman
tramping
the
open
road
pasteur
in
his
laboratory
or
florence
nightingale
seeking
the
wounded
on
the
field
of
battle
but
beyond
the
socialists
few
of
the
neighbors
had
heard
of
william
morris
and
the
fame
of
walt
whitman
was
still
more
apocryphal
pasteur
was
considered
merely
a
clever
scientist
without
the
romance
which
evokes
popular
affection
and
in
the
provisional
drawing
submitted
for
votes
gentle
florence
nightingale
was
said
to
look
more
as
if
she
were
robbing
the
dead
than
succoring
the
wounded
the
remark
shows
how
high
the
feeling
ran
and
then
as
something
must
be
done
quickly
we
tried
to
unite
upon
strictly
local
heroes
such
as
the
famous
fire
marshal
who
had
lived
for
many
years
in
our
neighborhood
but
why
prolong
this
description
which
demonstrates
once
more
that
art
if
not
always
the
handmaid
of
religion
yet
insists
upon
serving
those
deeper
sentiments
for
which
we
unexpectedly
find
ourselves
ready
to
fight
when
we
were
all
fatigued
and
hopeless
of
compromise
we
took
refuge
in
a
series
of
landscapes
connected
with
our
two
heroes
by
a
quotation
from
wordsworth
slightly
distorted
to
meet
our
dire
need
but
still
stating
his
impassioned
belief
in
the
efficacious
spirit
capable
of
companionship
with
man
which
resides
in
particular
spots
certainly
peace
emanates
from
the
particular
folding
of
the
hills
in
one
of
our
treasured
mural
landscapes
yet
occasionally
when
a
guest
with
a
bewildered
air
looks
from
one
side
of
the
theater
to
the
other
we
are
forced
to
conclude
that
the
connection
is
not
convincing
in
spite
of
its
stormy
career
this
attempt
at
mural
decoration
connects
itself
quite
naturally
with
the
spirit
of
our
earlier
efforts
to
make
as
beautiful
as
we
could
which
had
in
it
a
desire
to
embody
in
the
outward
aspect
of
the
house
something
of
the
reminiscence
and
aspiration
of
the
neighborhood
life
as
the
house
enlarged
for
new
needs
and
mellowed
through
associations
we
endeavored
to
fashion
it
from
without
as
it
were
as
well
as
from
within
a
tiny
wall
fountain
modeled
in
classic
pattern
for
us
penetrates
into
the
world
of
the
past
but
for
the
italian
immigrant
it
may
defy
distance
and
barriers
as
he
dimly
responds
to
that
typical
beauty
in
which
italy
has
ever
written
its
message
even
as
classic
art
knew
no
region
of
the
gods
which
was
not
also
sensuous
and
as
the
art
of
dante
mysteriously
blended
the
material
and
the
spiritual
perhaps
the
early
devotion
of
the
residents
to
the
recognized
that
they
above
all
english
speaking
poets
and
painters
reveal
the
sense
of
the
expressiveness
of
outward
things
which
is
at

echoes
of
the
russian
revolution
the
residents
of
have
always
seen
many
evidences
of
the
russian
revolution
a
forlorn
family
of
little
children
whose
parents
have
been
massacred
at
kishinev
are
received
and
supported
by
their
relatives
in
our
chicago
neighborhood
or
a
russian
woman
her
face
streaming
with
tears
of
indignation
and
pity
asks
you
to
look
at
the
scarred
back
of
her
sister
a
young
girl
who
has
escaped
with
her
life
from
the
whips
of
the
cossack
soldiers
or
a
studious
young
woman
suddenly
disappears
from
the
classes
because
she
has
returned
to
kiev
to
be
near
her
brother
while
he
is
in
prison
that
she
may
earn
money
for
the
nourishing
food
which
alone
will
keep
him
from
contracting
tuberculosis
or
we
attend
a
protest
meeting
against
the
newest
outrages
of
the
russian
government
in
which
the
speeches
are
interrupted
by
the
groans
of
those
whose
sons
have
been
sacrificed
and
by
the
hisses
of
others
who
can
not
repress
their
indignation
at
such
moments
an
american
is
acutely
conscious
of
our
ignorance
of
this
greatest
tragedy
of
modern
times
and
at
our
indifference
to
the
waste
of
perhaps
the
noblest
human
material
among
our
contemporaries
certain
it
is
as
the
distinguished
russian
revolutionists
have
come
to
chicago
they
have
impressed
me
as
no
one
else
ever
has
done
as
belonging
to
that
noble
company
of
martyrs
who
have
ever
and
again
poured
forth
blood
that
human
progress
might
be
advanced
sometimes
these
men
and
women
have
addressed
audiences
gathered
quite
outside
the
russian
colony
and
have
filled
to
overflowing
chicago
largest
halls
with
american
citizens
deeply
touched
by
this
message
of
martyrdom
one
significant
meeting
was
addressed
by
a
member
of
the
russian
duma
and
by
one
of
russia
oldest
and
sanest
revolutionists
another
by
madame
breshkovsky
who
later
languished
a
prisoner
in
the
fortress
of
peter
and
paul
in
this
wonderful
procession
of
revolutionists
prince
kropotkin
or
as
he
prefers
to
be
called
peter
kropotkin
was
doubtless
the
most
distinguished
when
he
came
to
america
to
lecture
he
was
heard
throughout
the
country
with
great
interest
and
respect
that
he
was
a
guest
of
during
his
stay
in
chicago
attracted
little
attention
at
the
time
but
two
years
later
when
the
assassination
of
president
mckinley
occurred
the
visit
of
this
kindly
scholar
who
had
always
called
himself
an
anarchist
and
had
certainly
written
fiery
tracts
in
his
younger
manhood
was
made
the
basis
of
an
attack
upon
by
a
daily
newspaper
which
ignored
the
fact
that
while
prince
kropotkin
had
addressed
the
chicago
arts
and
crafts
society
at
giving
a
digest
of
his
remarkable
book
on
fields
factories
and
workshops
he
had
also
spoken
at
the
state
universities
of
illinois
and
wisconsin
and
before
the
leading
literary
and
scientific
societies
of
chicago
these
institutions
and
societies
were
not
therefore
called
anarchistic
had
doubtless
laid
itself
open
to
this
attack
through
an
incident
connected
with
the
imprisonment
of
the
editor
on
an
anarchistic
paper
who
was
arrested
in
chicago
immediately
after
the
assassination
of
president
mckinley
in
the
excitement
following
the
national
calamity
and
the
avowal
by
the
assassin
of
the
influence
of
the
anarchistic
lecture
to
which
he
had
listened
arrests
were
made
in
chicago
of
every
one
suspected
of
anarchy
in
the
belief
that
a
widespread
plot
would
be
uncovered
the
editor
house
was
searched
for
incriminating
literature
his
wife
and
daughter
taken
to
a
police
station
and
his
son
and
himself
with
several
other
suspected
anarchists
were
placed
in
the
disused
cells
in
the
basement
of
the
city
hall
it
is
impossible
to
overstate
the
public
excitement
of
the
moment
and
the
unfathomable
sense
of
horror
with
which
the
community
regarded
an
attack
upon
the
chief
executive
of
the
nation
as
a
crime
against
government
itself
which
compels
an
instinctive
recoil
from
all
citizens
doubtless
both
the
horror
and
recoil
have
their
roots
deep
down
in
human
experience
the
earliest
forms
of
government
implied
a
group
which
offered
competent
resistance
to
outsiders
but
assuming
no
protection
was
necessary
between
any
two
of
its
own
members
promptly
punished
with
death
the
traitor
who
had
assaulted
anyone
within
an
anarchistic
attack
against
an
official
thus
furnishes
an
accredited
basis
both
for
unreasoning
hatred
and
for
prompt
punishment
both
the
hatred
and
the
determination
to
punish
reached
the
highest
pitch
in
chicago
after
the
assassination
of
president
mckinley
and
the
group
of
wretched
men
detained
in
the
scarcely
habitable
cells
had
not
the
least
idea
of
their
ultimate
fate
they
were
not
allowed
to
see
an
attorney
and
were
kept
in
communicado
as
their
excited
friends
called
it
i
had
seen
the
editor
and
his
family
only
during
prince
kropotkin
stay
at
when
they
had
come
to
visit
him
several
times
the
editor
had
impressed
me
as
a
quiet
scholarly
man
challenging
the
social
order
by
the
philosophic
touchstone
of
bakunin
and
of
herbert
spencer
somewhat
startled
by
the
radicalism
of
his
fiery
young
son
and
much
comforted
by
the
german
domesticity
of
his
wife
and
daughter
perhaps
it
was
but
my
hysterical
symptom
of
the
universal
excitement
but
it
certainly
seemed
to
me
more
than
i
could
bear
when
a
group
of
his
individualistic
friends
who
had
come
to
ask
for
help
said
you
see
what
becomes
of
your
boasted
law
the
authorities
wo
even
allow
an
attorney
nor
will
they
accept
bail
for
these
men
against
whom
nothing
can
be
proved
although
the
veriest
criminals
are
not
denied
such
a
right
challenged
by
an
anarchist
one
is
always
sensitive
for
the
honor
of
legally
constituted
society
and
i
replied
that
of
course
the
men
could
have
an
attorney
that
the
assassin
himself
would
eventually
be
furnished
with
one
that
the
fact
that
a
man
was
an
anarchist
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
rights
before
the
law
i
was
met
with
the
retort
that
that
might
do
for
a
theory
but
that
the
fact
still
remained
that
these
men
had
been
absolutely
isolated
seeing
no
one
but
policemen
who
constantly
frightened
them
with
tales
of
public
clamor
and
threatened
lynching
the
conversation
took
place
on
saturday
night
and
as
the
final
police
authority
rests
in
the
mayor
with
a
friend
who
was
equally
disturbed
over
the
situation
i
repaired
to
his
house
on
sunday
morning
to
appeal
to
him
in
the
interest
of
a
law
and
order
that
should
not
yield
to
panic
we
contended
that
to
the
anarchist
above
all
men
it
must
be
demonstrated
that
law
is
impartial
and
stands
the
test
of
every
strain
the
mayor
heard
us
through
with
the
ready
sympathy
of
the
successful
politician
he
insisted
however
that
the
men
thus
far
had
merely
been
properly
protected
against
lynching
but
that
it
might
now
be
safe
to
allow
them
to
see
some
one
he
would
not
yet
however
take
the
responsibility
of
permitting
an
attorney
but
if
i
myself
chose
to
see
them
on
the
humanitarian
errand
of
an
assurance
of
fair
play
he
would
write
me
a
permit
at
once
i
promptly
fell
into
the
trap
if
trap
it
was
and
within
half
an
hour
was
in
a
corridor
in
the
city
hall
basement
talking
to
the
distracted
editor
and
surrounded
by
a
cordon
of
police
who
assured
me
that
it
was
not
safe
to
permit
him
out
of
his
cell
the
editor
who
had
grown
thin
and
haggard
under
his
suspense
asked
immediately
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
his
wife
and
daughter
concerning
whom
he
had
heard
not
a
word
since
he
had
seen
them
arrested
gradually
he
became
composed
as
he
learned
not
that
his
testimony
had
been
believed
to
the
effect
that
he
had
never
seen
the
assassin
but
once
and
had
then
considered
him
a
foolish
creature
but
that
the
most
thoroughgoing
dragnet
investigations
on
the
part
of
the
united
police
of
the
country
had
failed
to
discover
a
plot
and
that
the
public
was
gradually
becoming
convinced
that
the
dastardly
act
was
that
of
a
solitary
man
with
no
political
or
social
affiliations
the
entire
conversation
was
simple
and
did
not
seem
to
me
unlike
in
motive
or
character
interviews
i
had
had
with
many
another
forlorn
man
who
had
fallen
into
prison
i
had
scarce
returned
to
however
before
it
was
filled
with
reporters
and
i
at
once
discovered
that
whether
or
not
i
had
helped
a
brother
out
of
a
pit
i
had
fallen
into
a
deep
one
myself
a
period
of
sharp
public
opprobrium
followed
traces
of
which
i
suppose
will
always
remain
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
the
letters
of
protest
and
accusation
which
made
my
mail
a
horror
every
morning
came
a
few
letters
of
another
sort
one
from
a
federal
judge
whom
i
had
never
seen
and
another
from
a
distinguished
professor
in
the
constitutional
law
who
congratulated
me
on
what
they
termed
a
sane
attempt
to
uphold
the
law
in
time
of
panic
although
one
or
two
ardent
young
people
rushed
into
print
to
defend
me
from
the
charge
of
abetting
anarchy
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
that
mere
words
would
not
avail
i
had
felt
that
the
protection
of
the
law
itself
extended
to
the
most
unpopular
citizen
was
the
only
reply
to
the
anarchistic
argument
to
the
effect
that
this
moment
of
panic
revealed
the
truth
of
their
theory
of
government
that
the
custodians
of
law
and
order
have
become
the
government
itself
quite
as
the
armed
men
hired
by
the
medieval
guilds
to
protect
them
in
the
peaceful
pursuit
of
their
avocations
through
sheer
possession
of
arms
finally
made
themselves
rulers
of
the
city
at
that
moment
i
was
firmly
convinced
that
the
public
could
only
be
convicted
of
the
blindness
of
its
course
when
a
body
of
people
with
a
of
the
moral
energy
possessed
by
a
settlement
group
should
make
clear
that
there
is
no
method
by
which
any
community
can
be
guarded
against
sporadic
efforts
on
the
part
of
crazed
discouraged
men
save
by
a
sense
of
mutual
rights
and
securities
which
will
include
the
veriest
outcast
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
in
the
millions
of
words
uttered
and
written
at
that
time
no
one
adequately
urged
that
citizens
set
themselves
the
task
of
patiently
discovering
how
these
sporadic
acts
of
violence
against
government
may
be
understood
and
averted
we
do
not
know
whether
they
occur
among
the
discouraged
and
unassimilated
immigrants
who
might
be
cared
for
in
such
a
way
as
enormously
to
lessen
the
probability
of
these
acts
or
whether
they
are
the
result
of
anarchistic
teaching
by
hastily
concluding
that
the
latter
is
the
sole
explanation
for
them
we
make
no
attempt
to
heal
and
cure
the
situation
failure
to
make
a
proper
diagnosis
may
mean
treatment
of
a
disease
which
does
not
exist
or
it
may
furthermore
mean
that
the
dire
malady
from
which
the
patient
is
suffering
be
permitted
to
develop
unchecked
and
yet
as
the
details
of
the
meager
life
of
the
president
assassin
were
disclosed
they
were
a
challenge
to
the
forces
for
social
betterment
in
american
cities
was
it
not
an
indictment
to
all
those
whose
business
it
is
to
interpret
and
solace
the
wretched
that
a
boy
should
have
grown
up
in
an
american
city
so
uncared
for
so
untouched
by
higher
issues
his
wounds
of
life
so
unhealed
by
religion
that
the
first
talk
he
ever
heard
dealing
with
life
wrongs
although
anarchistic
and
violent
should
yet
appear
to
point
a
way
of
relief
the
conviction
that
a
sense
of
fellowship
is
the
only
implement
which
will
break
into
the
locked
purpose
of
a
creature
bent
upon
destruction
in
the
name
of
justice
came
to
me
through
an
experience
recited
to
me
at
this
time
by
an
old
anarchist
he
was
a
german
cobbler
who
through
all
the
changes
in
the
manufacturing
of
shoes
had
steadily
clung
to
his
little
shop
on
a
chicago
thoroughfare
partly
as
an
expression
of
his
individualism
and
partly
because
he
preferred
bitter
poverty
in
a
place
of
his
own
to
good
wages
under
a
disciplinary
foreman
the
assassin
of
president
mckinley
on
his
way
through
chicago
only
a
few
days
before
he
committed
his
dastardly
deed
had
visited
all
the
anarchists
whom
he
could
find
in
the
city
asking
them
for
the
password
as
he
called
it
they
of
course
possessed
no
such
thing
and
had
turned
him
away
some
with
disgust
and
all
with
a
certain
degree
of
impatience
as
a
type
of
the
man
who
as
they
put
it
was
always
hanging
around
the
movement
without
the
slightest
conception
of
its
meaning
among
other
people
he
visited
the
german
cobbler
who
treated
him
much
as
the
others
had
done
but
who
after
the
event
had
made
clear
the
identity
of
his
visitor
was
filled
with
the
most
bitter
remorse
that
he
had
failed
to
utilize
his
chance
meeting
with
the
assassin
to
deter
him
from
his
purpose
he
knew
as
well
as
any
psychologist
who
has
read
the
history
of
such
solitary
men
that
the
only
possible
way
to
break
down
such
a
persistent
and
secretive
purpose
was
by
the
kindliness
which
might
have
induced
confession
which
might
have
restored
the
future
assassin
into
fellowship
with
normal
men
in
the
midst
of
his
remorse
the
cobbler
told
me
a
tale
of
his
own
youth
that
years
before
when
an
ardent
young
fellow
in
germany
newly
converted
to
the
philosophy
of
anarchism
as
he
called
it
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
church
as
much
as
the
state
was
responsible
for
human
oppression
and
that
this
fact
could
best
be
set
forth
in
the
deed
by
the
public
destruction
of
a
clergyman
or
priest
that
he
had
carried
firearms
for
a
year
with
this
purpose
in
mind
but
that
one
pleasant
summer
evening
in
a
moment
of
weakness
he
had
confided
his
intention
to
a
friend
and
that
from
that
moment
he
not
only
lost
all
desire
to
carry
it
out
but
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
preposterous
thing
imaginable
in
concluding
the
story
he
said
that
poor
fellow
sat
just
beside
me
on
my
bench
if
i
had
only
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
look
here
brother
what
is
on
your
mind
what
makes
you
talk
such
nonsense
tell
me
i
have
seen
much
of
life
and
understand
all
kinds
of
men
i
have
been
young
and
and
foolish
myself
if
he
had
told
me
of
his
purpose
then
and
there
he
would
never
have
carried
it
out
the
whole
nation
would
have
been
spared
this
horror
as
he
concluded
he
shook
his
gray
head
and
sighed
as
if
the
whole
incident
were
more
than
he
could
bear
one
of
those
terrible
sins
of
omission
one
of
the
things
he
ought
to
have
done
the
memory
of
which
is
so
hard
to
endure
the
attempt
a
settlement
makes
to
interpret
american
institutions
to
those
who
are
bewildered
concerning
them
either
because
of
their
personal
experiences
or
because
of
preconceived
theories
would
seem
to
lie
in
the
direct
path
of
its
public
obligation
and
yet
it
is
apparently
impossible
for
the
overwrought
community
to
distinguish
between
the
excitement
the
settlements
are
endeavoring
to
understand
and
to
allay
and
the
attitude
of
the
settlement
itself
at
times
of
public
panic
fervid
denunciation
is
held
to
be
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
and
if
a
settlement
is
convinced
that
the
incident
should
be
used
to
vindicate
the
law
and
does
not
at
the
moment
give
its
strength
to
denunciation
its
attitude
is
at
once
taken
to
imply
a
championship
of
anarchy
itself
the
public
mind
at
such
a
moment
falls
into
the
old
medieval
confusion
he
who
feeds
or
shelters
a
heretic
is
upon
prima
facie
evidence
a
heretic
himself
he
who
knows
intimately
people
among
whom
anarchists
arise
is
therefore
an
anarchist
i
personally
am
convinced
that
anarchy
as
a
philosophy
is
dying
down
not
only
in
chicago
but
everywhere
that
their
leading
organs
have
discontinued
publication
and
that
their
most
eminent
men
in
america
have
deserted
them
even
those
groups
which
have
continued
to
meet
are
dividing
and
the
major
half
in
almost
every
instance
calls
itself
an
apparent
contradiction
of
terms
whose
members
insist
that
the
socialistic
organization
of
society
must
be
the
next
stage
of
social
development
and
must
be
gone
through
with
so
to
speak
before
the
ideal
state
of
society
can
be
reached
so
nearly
begging
the
question
that
some
orthodox
socialists
are
willing
to
recognize
them
it
is
certainly
true
that
just
because
anarchy
questions
the
very
foundations
of
society
the
most
elemental
sense
of
protection
demands
that
the
method
of
meeting
the
challenge
should
be
intelligently
considered
whether
or
not
has
accomplished
anything
by
its
method
of
meeting
such
a
situation
or
at
least
attempting
to
treat
it
in
a
way
which
will
not
destroy
confidence
in
the
american
institutions
so
adored
by
refugees
from
foreign
governmental
oppression
it
is
of
course
impossible
for
me
to
say
and
yet
it
was
in
connection
with
an
effort
to
pursue
an
intelligent
policy
in
regard
to
a
foreign
anarchist
that
again
became
associated
with
that
creed
six
years
later
this
again
was
an
echo
of
the
russian
revolution
but
in
connection
with
one
of
its
humblest
representatives
a
young
russian
jew
named
averbuch
appeared
in
the
early
morning
at
the
house
of
the
chicago
chief
of
police
upon
an
obscure
errand
it
was
a
moment
of
panic
everwhere
in
regard
to
anarchists
because
of
a
recent
murder
in
denver
which
had
been
charged
to
an
italian
anarchist
and
the
chief
of
police
assuming
that
the
dark
young
man
standing
in
his
hallway
was
an
anarchist
bent
upon
his
assassination
hastily
called
for
help
in
a
panic
born
of
fear
and
young
averbuch
was
shot
to
death
the
members
of
the
colony
on
the
west
side
of
chicago
were
thrown
into
a
state
of
intense
excitement
as
soon
as
the
nationality
of
the
young
man
became
known
they
were
filled
with
dark
forebodings
from
a
swift
prescience
of
what
it
would
mean
to
them
were
the
oduim
of
anarchy
rightly
or
wrongly
attached
to
one
of
their
members
it
seemed
to
the
residents
of
most
important
that
every
effort
should
be
made
to
ascertain
just
what
did
happen
that
every
means
of
securing
information
should
be
exhausted
before
a
final
opinion
should
be
formed
and
this
odium
fastened
upon
a
colony
of
citizens
the
police
might
be
right
or
wrong
in
their
assertion
that
the
man
was
an
anarchist
it
was
to
our
minds
also
most
unfortunate
that
the
chicago
police
in
the
determination
to
uncover
an
anarchistic
plot
should
have
utilized
the
most
drastic
methods
of
search
within
the
colony
composed
of
families
only
too
familiar
with
the
methods
of
russian
police
therefore
when
the
chicago
police
ransacked
all
the
printing
offices
they
could
locate
in
the
colony
when
they
raided
a
restaurant
which
they
regarded
as
suspicious
because
it
had
been
supplying
food
at
cost
to
the
unemployed
when
they
searched
through
private
houses
for
papers
and
photographs
of
revolutionaries
when
they
seized
the
library
of
the
edelstadt
group
and
carried
the
books
including
shakespeare
and
herbert
spencer
to
the
city
hall
when
they
arrested
two
friends
of
young
averbuch
and
kept
them
in
the
police
station
hours
when
they
mercilessly
sweated
the
sister
olga
that
she
might
be
startled
into
a
confession
all
these
things
so
poignantly
reminded
them
of
russian
methods
that
indignation
fed
both
by
old
memory
and
bitter
disappointment
in
america
swept
over
the
entire
colony
the
older
men
asked
whether
constitutional
rights
gave
no
guarantee
against
such
violent
aggression
of
police
power
and
the
younger
ones
cried
out
at
once
that
the
only
way
to
deal
with
the
police
was
to
defy
them
which
was
true
of
police
the
world
over
it
was
said
many
times
that
those
who
are
without
influence
and
protection
in
a
strange
country
fare
exactly
as
hard
as
do
the
poor
in
europe
that
all
the
talk
of
guaranteed
protection
through
political
institutions
is
nonsense
every
settlement
has
classes
in
citizenship
in
which
the
principles
of
american
institutions
are
expounded
and
of
these
the
community
as
a
whole
approves
but
the
settlements
know
better
than
anyone
else
that
while
these
classes
and
lectures
are
useful
nothing
can
possibly
give
lessons
in
citizenship
so
effectively
and
make
so
clear
the
constitutional
basis
of
a
community
as
the
current
event
itself
the
treatment
at
a
given
moment
of
that
foreign
colony
which
feels
itself
outraged
and
misunderstood
either
makes
its
constitutional
rights
clear
to
it
or
forever
confuses
it
on
the
subject
the
only
method
by
which
a
reasonable
and
loyal
conception
of
government
may
be
substituted
for
the
one
formed
upon
russian
experiences
is
that
the
actual
experience
of
refugees
with
government
in
america
shall
gradually
demonstrate
what
a
very
different
thing
government
means
here
such
an
event
as
the
averbuch
affair
affords
an
unprecedented
opportunity
to
make
clear
this
difference
and
to
demonstrate
beyond
the
possibility
of
misunderstanding
that
the
guarantee
of
constitutional
rights
implies
that
officialism
shall
be
restrained
and
guarded
at
every
point
that
the
official
represents
not
the
will
of
a
small
administrative
body
but
the
will
of
the
entire
people
and
that
methods
therefore
have
been
constituted
by
which
official
aggression
may
be
restrained
the
averbuch
incident
gave
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
this
to
that
very
body
of
people
who
need
it
most
to
those
who
have
lived
in
russia
where
autocratic
officers
represent
autocratic
power
and
where
government
is
officialism
it
seemed
to
the
residents
in
the
settlements
nearest
the
colony
that
it
was
an
obvious
piece
of
public
spirit
to
try
out
all
the
legal
value
involved
to
insist
that
american
institutions
were
stout
enough
to
break
down
in
times
of
stress
and
public
panic
the
belief
of
many
russians
that
the
averbuch
incident
would
be
made
a
prelude
to
the
constant
use
of
the
extradition
treaty
for
the
sake
of
terrorizing
revolutionists
both
at
home
and
abroad
received
a
certain
corroboration
when
an
attempt
was
made
in
to
extradite
a
russian
revolutionist
named
rudovitz
who
was
living
in
chicago
the
first
hearing
before
a
united
states
commissioner
gave
a
verdict
favorable
to
the
russian
government
although
this
was
afterward
reversed
by
the
department
of
state
in
washington
partly
to
educate
american
sentiment
partly
to
express
sympathy
with
the
russian
refugees
in
their
dire
need
a
series
of
public
meetings
was
arranged
in
which
the
operations
of
the
extradition
treaty
were
discussed
by
many
of
us
who
had
spoken
at
a
meeting
held
in
protest
against
its
ratification
fifteen
years
before
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
unacquainted
with
the
russian
colony
to
realize
the
consternation
produced
by
this
attempted
extradition
i
acted
as
treasurer
of
the
fund
collected
to
defray
the
expenses
of
halls
and
printing
in
the
campaign
against
the
policy
of
extradition
and
had
many
opportunities
to
talk
with
members
of
the
colony
one
old
man
tearing
his
hair
and
beard
as
he
spoke
declared
that
all
his
sons
and
grandsons
might
thus
be
sent
back
to
russia
in
fact
all
of
the
younger
men
in
the
colony
might
be
extradited
for
every
young
russian
was
in
a
sense
a
revolutionist
would
it
not
provoke
to
ironic
laughter
that
very
nemesis
which
presides
over
the
destinies
of
nations
if
the
most
autocratic
government
yet
remaining
in
civilization
should
succeed
in
utilizing
for
its
own
autocratic
methods
the
youngest
and
most
daring
experiment
in
democratic
government
which
the
world
has
ever
seen
stranger
results
have
followed
a
course
of
stupidity
and
injustice
resulting
from
blindness
and
panic
it
is
certainly
true
that
if
the
decision
of
the
federal
office
in
chicago
had
not
been
reversed
by
the
department
of
state
in
washington
the
united
states
government
would
have
been
committed
to
return
thousands
of
spirited
young
refugees
to
the
punishments
of
the
russian
autocracy
it
was
perhaps
significant
of
our
need
of
what
napoleon
called
a
revival
of
civic
morals
that
the
public
appeal
against
such
a
reversal
of
our
traditions
had
to
be
based
largely
upon
the
contributions
to
american
progress
made
from
other
revolutions
the
puritans
from
the
english
lafayette
from
the
french
carl
schurz
and
many
another
able
man
from
the
german
upheavals
in
the
middle
of
the
century
a
distinguished
german
scholar
writing
at
the
end
of
his
long
life
a
description
of
his
friends
of
who
made
a
gallant
although
premature
effort
to
unite
the
german
states
and
to
secure
a
constitutional
government
thus
concludes
but
not
a
few
saw
the
whole
of
their
lives
wrecked
either
in
prison
or
poverty
though
they
had
done
no
wrong
and
in
many
cases
were
the
finest
characters
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
know
they
were
before
their
time
the
fruit
was
not
ripe
as
it
was
in
and
germany
but
lost
her
best
sons
in
those
miserable
years
when
the
time
is
ripe
in
russia
when
she
finally
yields
to
those
great
forces
which
are
molding
and
renovating
contemporary
life
when
her
cavour
and
her
bismark
finally
throw
into
the
first
governmental
forms
all
that
yearning
for
juster
human
relations
which
the
idealistic
russian
revolutionists
embody
we
may
look
back
upon
these
miserable
years
with
a
sense
of
chagrin
at
our
lack
of
sympathy
and
understanding
again
it
is
far
from
easy
to
comprehend
the
great
russian
struggle
i
recall
a
visit
from
the
famous
revolutionist
gershuni
who
had
escaped
from
siberia
in
a
barrel
of
cabbage
rolled
under
the
very
fortress
of
the
commandant
himself
had
made
his
way
through
manchuria
and
china
to
san
francisco
and
on
his
way
back
to
russia
had
stopped
in
chicago
for
a
few
days
three
months
later
we
heard
of
his
death
and
whenever
i
recall
the
conversation
held
with
him
i
find
it
invested
with
that
dignity
which
last
words
imply
upon
the
request
of
a
comrade
gershuni
had
repeated
the
substance
of
the
famous
speech
he
had
made
to
the
court
which
sentenced
him
to
siberia
as
representing
the
government
against
which
he
had
rebelled
he
told
the
court
that
he
might
in
time
be
able
to
forgive
all
of
their
outrages
and
injustices
save
one
the
unforgivable
outrage
would
remain
that
hundreds
of
men
like
himself
who
were
vegetarians
because
they
were
not
willing
to
participate
in
the
destruction
of
living
creatures
who
had
never
struck
a
child
even
in
punishment
who
were
so
consumed
with
tenderness
for
the
outcast
and
oppressed
that
they
had
lived
for
weeks
among
starving
peasants
only
that
they
might
cheer
and
solace
them
that
these
men
should
have
been
driven
into
terrorism
until
impelled
to
execute
as
they
call
it
assassinate
the
would
term
it
public
officials
was
something
for
which
he
would
never
forgive
the
russian
government
it
was
perhaps
the
heat
of
the
argument
as
much
as
conviction
which
led
me
to
reply
that
it
would
be
equally
difficult
for
society
to
forgive
these
very
revolutionists
for
one
thing
they
had
done
their
institution
of
the
use
of
force
in
such
wise
that
it
would
inevitably
be
imitated
by
men
of
less
scruple
and
restraint
that
to
have
revived
such
a
method
in
civilization
to
have
justified
it
by
their
disinterestedness
of
purpose
and
nobility
of
character
was
perhaps
the
gravest
responsibility
that
any
group
of
men
could
assume
with
a
smile
of
indulgent
pity
such
as
one
might
grant
to
a
mistaken
child
he
replied
that
such
tolstoyan
principles
were
as
fitted
to
russia
as
these
toilettes
pointing
to
the
thin
summer
gowns
of
his
listeners
were
fitted
to
a
siberian
winter
and
yet
i
held
the
belief
then
as
i
certainly
do
now
that
when
the
sense
of
justice
seeks
to
express
itself
quite
outside
the
regular
channels
of
established
government
it
has
set
forth
on
a
dangerous
journey
inevitably
ending
in
disaster
and
that
this
is
true
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
adventure
may
have
been
inspired
by
noble
motives
still
more
perplexing
than
the
use
of
force
by
the
revolutionists
is
the
employment
of
the
on
the
part
of
the
russian
government
the
visit
of
vladimir
bourtzeff
to
chicago
just
after
his
exposure
of
the
famous
secret
agent
azeff
filled
one
with
perplexity
in
regard
to
a
government
which
would
connive
at
the
violent
death
of
a
faithful
official
and
that
of
a
member
of
the
royal
household
for
the
sake
of
bringing
opprobrium
and
punishment
to
the
revolutionists
and
credit
to
the
secret
police
the
settlement
has
also
suffered
through
its
effort
to
secure
open
discussion
of
the
methods
of
the
russian
government
during
the
excitement
connected
with
the
visit
of
gorki
to
this
country
three
different
committees
of
russians
came
to
begging
that
i
would
secure
a
statement
in
at
least
one
of
the
chicago
dailies
of
their
own
view
that
the
agents
of
the
czar
had
cleverly
centered
public
attention
upon
gorki
private
life
and
had
fomented
a
scandal
so
successfully
that
the
object
of
visit
to
america
had
been
foiled
he
who
had
known
intimately
the
most
wretched
of
the
czar
subjects
who
was
best
able
to
sympathetically
portray
their
wretchedness
not
only
failed
to
get
a
hearing
before
an
american
audience
but
could
scarcely
find
the
shelter
of
a
roof
i
told
two
of
the
russian
committees
that
it
was
hopeless
to
undertake
any
explanation
of
the
bitter
attack
until
public
excitement
had
somewhat
subsided
but
one
sunday
afternoon
when
a
third
committee
arrived
i
said
that
i
would
endeavor
to
have
reprinted
in
a
chicago
daily
the
few
scattered
articles
written
for
the
magazines
which
tried
to
explain
the
situation
one
by
the
head
professor
in
political
economy
of
a
leading
university
and
others
by
publicists
well
informed
as
to
russian
affairs
i
hoped
that
a
cosmopolitan
newspaper
might
feel
an
obligation
to
recognize
the
desire
for
fair
play
on
the
part
of
thousands
of
its
readers
among
the
russians
poles
and
finns
at
least
to
the
extent
of
reproducing
these
magazine
articles
under
a
noncommittal
caption
that
same
sunday
evening
in
company
with
one
of
the
residents
i
visited
a
newspaper
office
only
to
hear
its
representative
say
that
my
plan
was
quite
out
of
the
question
as
the
whole
subject
was
what
newspaper
men
called
a
sacred
cow
he
said
however
that
he
would
willingly
print
an
article
which
i
myself
should
write
and
sign
i
declined
this
offer
with
the
statement
that
one
who
had
my
opportunities
to
see
the
struggles
of
poor
women
in
securing
support
for
their
children
found
it
impossible
to
write
anything
which
would
however
remotely
justify
the
loosening
of
marriage
bonds
even
if
the
defense
of
gorki
made
by
the
russian
committees
was
sound
we
left
the
newspaper
office
somewhat
discouraged
with
what
we
thought
one
more
unsuccessful
effort
to
procure
a
hearing
for
the
immigrants
i
had
considered
the
incident
closed
when
to
my
horror
and
surprise
several
months
afterward
it
was
made
the
basis
of
a
story
with
every
possible
vicious
interpretation
one
of
the
chicago
newspapers
had
been
indicted
by
mayor
dunne
for
what
he
considered
an
actionable
attack
upon
his
appointees
to
the
chicago
school
board
of
whom
i
was
one
and
the
incident
enlarged
and
coarsened
was
submitted
as
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
in
regard
to
my
views
and
influence
although
the
evidence
was
thrown
out
an
attempt
was
again
made
to
revive
this
story
by
the
managers
of
mayor
dunne
second
campaign
this
time
to
show
how
the
protector
of
the
oppressed
was
traduced
the
incident
is
related
here
as
an
example
of
the
clever
use
of
that
old
device
which
throws
upon
the
radical
in
religion
in
education
and
in
social
reform
the
oduim
of
encouraging
harlots
and
sinners
and
of
defending
their
doctrines
if
the
under
dog
were
always
right
one
might
quite
easily
try
to
defend
him
the
trouble
is
that
very
often
he
is
but
obscurely
right
sometimes
only
partially
right
and
often
quite
wrong
but
perhaps
he
is
never
so
altogether
wrong
and
and
utterly
reprehensible
as
he
is
represented
to
be
by
those
who
add
the
possession
of
prejudices
to
the
other
almost
insuperable
difficulties
of
understanding
him
it
was
perhaps
not
surprising
that
with
these
excellent
opportunities
for
misjudging
we
should
have
suffered
attack
from
time
to
time
whenever
any
untoward
event
gave
an
opening
as
when
an
italian
immigrant
murdered
a
priest
in
denver
colorado
although
the
wretched
man
had
never
been
in
chicago
much
less
at
a
chicago
ecclesiastic
asserted
that
he
had
learned
hatred
of
the
church
as
a
member
of
the
giordano
bruno
club
an
italian
club
one
of
whose
members
lived
at
and
which
had
occasionally
met
there
although
it
had
long
maintained
clubrooms
of
its
own
this
club
had
its
origin
in
the
old
struggles
of
united
italy
against
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
one
of
the
european
echoes
with
which
chicago
resounds
the
italian
resident
as
the
editor
of
a
paper
representing
new
italy
had
come
in
sharp
conflict
with
the
chicago
ecclesiastic
first
in
regard
to
naming
a
public
school
of
the
vicinity
after
garibaldi
which
was
of
course
not
tolerated
by
the
church
and
then
in
regard
to
many
another
issue
arising
in
anticlericalism
which
although
a
political
party
is
constantly
involved
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
in
theological
difficulties
the
contest
had
been
carried
on
with
a
bitterness
impossible
for
an
american
to
understand
but
its
origin
and
implications
were
so
obvious
that
it
did
not
occur
to
any
of
us
that
it
could
be
associated
with
either
in
its
motive
or
direction
the
ecclesiastic
himself
had
lived
for
years
in
rome
and
as
i
had
often
discussed
the
problems
of
italian
politics
with
him
i
was
quite
sure
he
understood
the
raison
for
the
giordano
bruno
club
fortunately
in
the
midst
of
the
rhetorical
attack
our
friendly
relations
remained
unbroken
with
the
neighboring
priests
from
whom
we
continued
to
receive
uniform
courtesy
as
we
cooperated
in
cases
of
sorrow
and
need
hundreds
of
devout
communicants
identified
with
the
various
clubs
and
classes
were
deeply
distressed
by
the
incident
but
assured
us
it
was
all
a
misunderstanding
easter
came
soon
afterwards
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
a
connection
between
the
attack
and
the
myriad
of
easter
cards
which
filled
my
mail
thus
a
settlement
becomes
involved
in
the
many
difficulties
of
its
neighbors
as
its
experiences
make
vivid
the
consciousness
of
modern
internationalism
and
yet
the
very
fact
that
the
sense
of
reality
is
so
keen
and
the
obligation
of
the
settlement
so
obvious
may
perhaps
in
itself
explain
the
opposition
has
encountered
when
it
expressed
its
sympathy
with
the
russian
revolution
we
were
much
entertained
although
somewhat
ruefully
when
a
chicago
woman
withdrew
from
us
a
large
annual
subscription
because
had
defended
a
russian
refugee
while
she
who
had
seen
much
of
the
russian
aristocracy
in
europe
knew
from
them
that
all
the
revolutionary
agitation
was
both
unreasonable
and
unnecessary
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
say
whether
these
oppositions
were
inevitable
or
whether
they
were
indications
that
had
somehow
bungled
at
its
task
many
times
i
have
been
driven
to
the
confession
of
the
blundering
amiel
it
requires
ability
to
make
what
we
seem
agree
with
what
we
are

socialized
education
in
a
paper
written
years
ago
i
deplored
at
some
length
the
fact
that
educational
matters
are
more
democratic
in
their
political
than
in
their
social
aspect
and
i
quote
the
following
extract
from
it
as
throwing
some
light
upon
the
earlier
educational
undertakings
at
teaching
in
a
settlement
requires
distinct
methods
for
it
is
true
of
people
who
have
been
allowed
to
remain
undeveloped
and
whose
facilities
are
inert
and
sterile
that
they
can
not
take
their
learning
heavily
it
has
to
be
diffused
in
a
social
atmosphere
information
must
be
held
in
solution
in
a
medium
of
fellowship
and
good
will
intellectual
life
requires
for
its
expansion
and
manifestation
the
influences
and
assimilation
of
the
interests
and
affections
of
others
mazzini
that
greatest
of
all
democrats
who
broke
his
heart
over
the
condition
of
the
south
european
peasantry
said
education
is
not
merely
a
necessity
of
true
life
by
which
the
individual
renews
his
vital
force
in
the
vital
force
of
humanity
it
is
a
holy
communion
with
generations
dead
and
living
by
which
he
fecundates
all
his
faculties
when
he
is
withheld
from
this
communion
for
generations
as
the
italian
peasant
has
been
we
say
is
like
a
beast
of
the
field
he
must
be
controlled
by
force
even
to
this
it
is
sometimes
added
that
it
is
absurd
to
educate
him
immoral
to
disturb
his
content
we
stupidly
use
the
effect
as
an
argument
for
a
continuance
of
the
cause
it
is
needless
to
say
that
a
settlement
is
a
protest
against
a
restricted
view
of
education
in
line
with
this
declaration
in
the
very
beginning
opened
what
we
called
college
extension
classes
with
a
faculty
finally
numbering
college
men
and
women
many
of
whom
held
their
pupils
for
consecutive
years
as
these
classes
antedated
in
chicago
the
university
extension
and
normal
extension
classes
and
supplied
a
demand
for
stimulating
instruction
the
attendance
strained
to
their
utmost
capacity
the
spacious
rooms
in
the
old
house
the
relation
of
students
and
faculty
to
each
other
and
to
the
residents
was
that
of
guest
and
hostess
and
at
the
close
of
each
term
the
residents
gave
a
reception
to
students
and
faculty
which
was
one
of
the
chief
social
events
of
the
season
upon
this
comfortable
social
basis
some
very
good
work
was
done
in
connection
with
these
classes
a
summer
school
was
instituted
at
rockford
college
which
was
most
generously
placed
at
our
disposal
by
the
trustees
for
ten
years
one
hundred
women
gathered
there
for
six
weeks
in
addition
there
were
always
men
on
the
faculty
and
a
small
group
of
young
men
among
the
students
who
were
lodged
in
the
gymnasium
building
the
outdoor
classes
in
bird
study
and
botany
the
serious
reading
of
literary
masterpieces
the
boat
excursions
on
the
rock
river
the
cooperative
spirit
of
doing
the
housework
together
the
satirical
commencements
in
caps
and
gowns
lent
themselves
toward
a
reproduction
of
the
comradeship
which
college
life
fosters
as
each
member
of
the
faculty
as
well
as
the
students
paid
three
dollars
a
week
and
as
we
had
little
outlay
beyond
the
actual
cost
of
food
we
easily
defrayed
our
expenses
the
undertaking
was
so
simple
and
gratifying
in
results
that
it
might
well
be
reproduced
in
many
college
buildings
which
are
set
in
the
midst
of
beautiful
surroundings
unused
during
the
two
months
of
the
year
when
hundreds
of
people
able
to
pay
only
a
moderate
price
for
lodgings
in
the
country
can
find
nothing
comfortable
and
no
mental
food
more
satisfying
than
piazza
gossip
every
thursday
evening
during
the
first
years
a
public
lecture
came
to
be
an
expected
event
in
the
neighborhood
and
became
one
of
the
early
university
extension
centers
first
in
connection
with
an
independent
society
and
later
with
the
university
of
chicago
one
of
the
trustees
was
so
impressed
with
the
value
of
this
orderly
and
continuous
presentation
of
economic
subjects
that
he
endowed
three
courses
in
a
downtown
center
in
which
the
lectures
were
free
to
anyone
who
chose
to
come
he
was
much
pleased
that
these
lectures
were
largely
attended
by
workingmen
who
ordinarily
prefer
that
an
economic
subject
shall
be
presented
by
a
partisan
and
who
are
supremely
indifferent
to
examinations
and
credits
they
also
dislike
the
balancing
of
pro
and
con
which
scholarly
instruction
implies
and
prefer
to
be
inebriated
on
raw
truth
rather
than
to
sip
a
carefully
prepared
draught
of
knowledge
nevertheless
bowen
hall
which
seats
seven
hundred
and
fifty
people
is
often
none
too
large
to
hold
the
audiences
of
men
who
come
to
every
sunday
evening
during
the
winter
to
attend
the
illustrated
lectures
provided
by
the
faculty
of
the
university
of
chicago
and
others
who
kindly
give
their
services
these
courses
differ
enormously
in
their
popularity
one
on
european
capitals
and
their
social
significance
was
followed
with
the
most
vivid
attention
and
sense
of
participation
indicated
by
groans
and
hisses
when
the
audience
was
reminded
of
an
unforgettable
feud
between
austria
and
her
slavic
subjects
or
when
they
wildly
applauded
a
polish
hero
endeared
through
his
tragic
failure
in
spite
of
the
success
of
these
sunday
evening
courses
it
has
never
been
an
easy
undertaking
to
find
acceptable
lectures
a
course
of
lectures
on
astronomy
illustrated
by
stereopticon
slides
will
attract
a
large
audience
the
first
week
who
hope
to
hear
of
the
wonders
of
the
heavens
and
the
relation
of
our
earth
thereto
but
instead
are
treated
to
spectrum
analyses
of
star
dust
or
the
latest
theory
concerning
the
milky
way
the
habit
of
research
and
the
desire
to
say
the
latest
word
upon
any
subject
often
overcomes
the
sympathetic
understanding
of
his
audience
which
the
lecturer
might
otherwise
develop
and
he
insensibly
drops
into
the
dull
terminology
of
the
classroom
there
are
of
course
notable
exceptions
we
had
twelve
gloriously
popular
talks
on
organic
evolution
but
the
lecturer
was
not
yet
a
professor
merely
a
university
instructor
and
his
mind
was
still
eager
over
the
marvel
of
it
all
fortunately
there
is
an
increasing
number
of
lecturers
whose
matter
is
so
real
so
definite
and
so
valuable
that
in
an
attempt
to
give
it
an
exact
equivalence
in
words
they
utilize
the
most
direct
forms
of
expression
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
the
men
of
substantial
scholarship
were
content
to
leave
to
the
charletan
the
teaching
of
those
things
which
deeply
concern
the
welfare
of
mankind
and
that
the
mass
of
men
get
their
intellectual
food
from
the
outcasts
of
scholarship
who
provide
millions
of
books
pictures
and
shows
not
to
instruct
and
guide
but
for
the
sake
of
their
own
financial
profit
a
settlement
soon
discovers
that
simple
people
are
interested
in
large
and
vital
subjects
and
the
residents
themselves
at
one
time
with
only
partial
success
undertook
to
give
a
series
of
lectures
on
the
history
of
the
world
beginning
with
the
nebular
hypothesis
and
reaching
chicago
itself
in
the
lecture
absurd
as
the
hasty
review
appears
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
beginner
in
knowledge
is
always
eager
for
the
general
statement
as
those
wise
old
teachers
of
the
people
well
knew
when
they
put
the
history
of
creation
on
the
stage
and
the
monks
themselves
became
the
actors
i
recall
that
in
planning
my
first
european
journey
i
had
soberly
hoped
in
two
years
to
trace
the
entire
pattern
of
human
excellence
as
we
passed
from
one
country
to
another
in
the
shrines
popular
affection
had
consecrated
to
the
saints
in
the
frequented
statues
erected
to
heroes
and
in
the
worn
blasonry
of
funeral
brasses
an
illustration
that
when
we
are
young
we
all
long
for
those
mountaintops
upon
which
we
may
soberly
stand
and
dream
of
our
own
ephemeral
and
uncertain
attempts
at
righteousness
i
have
had
many
other
illustrations
of
this
a
statement
was
recently
made
to
me
by
a
member
of
the
boys
club
who
had
been
unjustly
arrested
as
an
accomplice
to
a
young
thief
and
held
in
the
police
station
for
three
days
that
during
his
detention
he
had
remembered
the
way
jean
valjean
behaved
when
he
was
everlastingly
pursued
by
that
policeman
who
was
only
trying
to
do
right
i
kept
seeing
the
pictures
in
that
illustrated
lecture
you
gave
about
him
and
i
thought
it
would
be
queer
if
i
behave
well
for
three
days
when
he
had
kept
it
up
for
years
the
power
of
dramatic
action
may
unfortunately
be
illustrated
in
other
ways
during
the
weeks
when
all
the
daily
papers
were
full
of
the
details
of
a
notorious
murder
trial
in
new
york
and
all
the
hideous
events
which
preceded
the
crime
one
evening
i
saw
in
the
street
a
knot
of
working
girls
leaning
over
a
newspaper
admiring
the
clothes
the
beauty
and
sorrowful
expression
of
the
unhappy
heroine
in
the
midst
of
the
trial
a
woman
whom
i
had
known
for
years
came
to
talk
to
me
about
her
daughter
shamefacedly
confessing
that
the
girl
was
trying
to
dress
and
look
like
the
notorious
girl
in
new
york
and
that
she
had
even
said
to
her
mother
in
a
moment
of
defiance
some
day
i
shall
be
taken
into
court
and
then
i
shall
dress
just
as
evelyn
did
and
face
my
accusers
as
she
did
in
innocence
and
beauty
if
one
makes
calls
on
a
sunday
afternoon
in
the
homes
of
the
immigrant
colonies
near
one
finds
the
family
absorbed
in
the
sunday
edition
of
a
sensational
daily
newspaper
even
those
who
can
not
read
quite
easily
following
the
comic
adventures
portrayed
in
the
colored
pictures
of
the
supplement
or
tracing
the
clew
of
a
murderer
carefully
depicted
by
a
black
line
drawn
through
a
plan
of
the
houses
and
streets
sometimes
lessons
in
the
great
loyalties
and
group
affections
come
through
life
itself
and
yet
in
such
a
manner
that
one
can
not
but
deplore
it
during
the
teamsters
strike
in
chicago
several
years
ago
when
class
bitterness
rose
to
a
dramatic
climax
i
remember
going
to
visit
a
neighborhood
boy
who
had
been
severely
injured
when
he
had
taken
the
place
of
a
union
driver
upon
a
coal
wagon
as
i
approached
the
house
in
which
he
lived
a
large
group
of
boys
and
girls
some
of
them
very
little
children
surrounded
me
to
convey
the
exciting
information
that
jack
was
a
and
that
i
could
go
in
there
i
explained
to
the
excited
children
that
his
mother
who
was
a
friend
of
mine
was
in
trouble
quite
irrespective
of
the
way
her
boy
had
been
hurt
the
crowd
around
me
outside
of
the
house
of
the
scab
constantly
grew
larger
and
i
finally
abandoning
my
attempt
at
explanation
walked
in
only
to
have
the
mother
say
please
do
come
here
you
will
only
get
hurt
too
of
course
i
did
not
get
hurt
but
the
episode
left
upon
my
mind
one
of
the
most
painful
impressions
i
have
ever
received
in
connection
with
the
children
of
the
neighborhood
in
addition
to
all
else
are
the
lessons
of
loyalty
and
comradeship
to
come
to
them
as
the
mere
reversals
of
class
antagonism
and
yet
it
was
but
a
trifling
incident
out
of
the
general
spirit
of
bitterness
and
strife
which
filled
the
city
therefore
the
residents
of
place
increasing
emphasis
upon
the
great
inspirations
and
solaces
of
literature
and
are
unwilling
that
it
should
ever
languish
as
a
subject
for
class
instruction
or
for
reading
parties
the
shakespeare
club
has
lived
a
continuous
existence
at
for
sixteen
years
during
which
time
its
members
have
heard
the
leading
interpreters
of
shakespeare
both
among
scholars
and
players
i
recall
that
one
of
its
earliest
members
said
that
her
mind
was
peopled
with
shakespeare
characters
during
her
long
hours
of
sewing
in
a
shop
that
she
could
remember
what
she
thought
about
before
she
joined
the
club
and
concluded
that
she
had
thought
about
anything
at
all
to
feed
the
mind
of
the
worker
to
lift
it
above
the
monotony
of
his
task
and
to
connect
it
with
the
larger
world
outside
of
his
immediate
surroundings
has
always
been
the
object
of
art
perhaps
never
more
nobly
fulfilled
than
by
the
great
english
bard
miss
starr
has
held
classes
in
dante
and
browning
for
many
years
and
the
great
lines
are
conned
with
never
failing
enthusiasm
i
recall
miss
lathrop
plato
club
and
an
audience
who
listened
to
a
series
of
lectures
by
john
dewey
on
social
psychology
as
geniune
intellectual
groups
consisting
largely
of
people
from
the
immediate
neighborhood
who
were
willing
to
make
that
effort
from
which
we
all
shrink
the
effort
of
thought
but
while
we
prize
these
classes
as
we
do
the
help
we
are
able
to
give
to
the
exceptional
young
man
or
woman
who
reaches
the
college
and
university
and
leaves
the
neighborhood
of
his
childhood
behind
him
the
residents
of
feel
increasingly
that
the
educational
efforts
of
a
settlement
should
not
be
directed
primarily
to
reproduce
the
college
type
of
culture
but
to
work
out
a
method
and
an
ideal
adapted
to
the
immediate
situation
they
feel
that
they
should
promote
a
culture
which
will
not
set
its
possessor
aside
in
a
class
with
others
like
himself
but
which
will
on
the
contrary
connect
him
with
all
sorts
of
people
by
his
ability
to
understand
them
as
well
as
by
his
power
to
supplement
their
present
surroundings
with
the
historic
background
among
the
hundreds
of
immigrants
who
have
for
years
attended
classes
at
designed
primarily
to
teach
the
english
language
dozens
of
them
have
struggled
to
express
in
the
newly
acquired
tongue
some
of
these
hopes
and
longings
which
had
so
much
to
do
with
their
emigration
a
series
of
plays
was
thus
written
by
a
young
bohemian
essays
by
a
russian
youth
outpouring
sorrows
rivaling
werther
himself
and
yet
containing
the
precious
stuff
of
youth
perennial
revolt
against
accepted
wrong
stories
of
russian
oppression
and
petty
injustices
throughout
which
the
desire
for
free
america
became
a
crystallized
hope
an
attempt
to
portray
the
jewish
day
of
atonement
in
such
wise
that
even
individualistic
americans
may
catch
a
glimpse
of
that
deeper
national
life
which
has
survived
all
transplanting
and
expresses
itself
in
forms
so
ancient
that
they
appear
grotesque
to
the
ignorant
spectator
i
remember
a
pathetic
effort
on
the
part
of
a
young
russian
jewess
to
describe
the
vivid
inner
life
of
an
old
talmud
scholar
probably
her
uncle
or
father
as
of
one
persistently
occupied
with
the
grave
and
important
things
of
the
spirit
although
when
brought
into
sharp
contact
with
busy
and
overworked
people
he
inevitably
appeared
and
slothful
certainly
no
one
who
had
read
her
paper
could
again
see
such
an
old
man
in
his
praying
shawl
bent
over
his
crabbed
book
without
a
sense
of
understanding
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
most
pitiful
periods
in
the
drama
of
the
young
american
who
attempts
to
rise
in
life
is
the
time
when
his
educational
requirements
seem
to
have
locked
him
up
and
made
him
rigid
he
fancies
himself
shut
off
from
his
uneducated
family
and
misunderstood
by
his
friends
he
is
bowed
down
by
his
mental
accumulations
and
often
gets
no
farther
than
to
carry
them
through
life
as
a
great
burden
and
not
once
does
he
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
delights
of
knowledge
the
teacher
in
a
settlement
is
constantly
put
upon
his
mettle
to
discover
methods
of
instruction
which
shall
make
knowledge
quickly
available
to
his
pupils
and
i
should
like
here
to
pay
my
tribute
of
admiration
to
the
dean
of
our
educational
department
miss
landsberg
and
to
the
many
men
and
women
who
every
winter
come
regularly
to
putting
untiring
energy
into
the
endless
task
of
teaching
the
newly
arrived
immigrant
the
first
use
of
a
language
of
which
he
has
such
desperate
need
even
a
meager
knowledge
of
english
may
mean
an
opportunity
to
work
in
a
factory
versus
nonemployment
or
it
may
mean
a
question
of
life
or
death
when
a
sharp
command
must
be
understood
in
order
to
avoid
the
danger
of
a
descending
crane
in
response
to
a
demand
for
an
education
which
should
be
immediately
available
classes
have
been
established
and
grown
apace
in
cooking
dressmaking
and
millinery
a
girl
who
attends
them
will
often
say
that
she
expects
to
marry
a
workingman
next
spring
and
because
she
has
worked
in
a
factory
so
long
she
knows
little
about
a
house
sometimes
classes
are
composed
of
young
matrons
of
like
factory
experiences
i
recall
one
of
them
whose
husband
had
become
so
desperate
after
two
years
of
her
unskilled
cooking
that
he
had
threatened
to
desert
her
and
go
where
he
could
get
decent
food
as
she
confided
to
me
in
a
tearful
interview
when
she
followed
my
advice
to
take
the
courses
in
cooking
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
reported
a
united
and
happy
home
two
distinct
trends
are
found
in
response
to
these
classes
the
first
is
for
domestic
training
and
the
other
is
for
trade
teaching
which
shall
enable
the
poor
little
milliner
and
dressmaker
apprentices
to
shorten
the
years
of
errand
running
which
is
supposed
to
teach
them
their
trade
the
beginning
of
trade
instruction
has
been
already
evolved
in
connection
with
the
boys
club
the
ample
boys
club
building
presented
to
three
years
ago
by
one
of
our
trustees
has
afforded
shops
for
work
in
wood
iron
and
brass
for
smithing
in
copper
and
tin
for
commercial
photography
for
printing
for
telegraphy
and
electrical
construction
these
shops
have
been
filled
with
boys
who
are
eager
for
that
which
seems
to
give
them
a
clew
to
the
industrial
life
all
about
them
these
classes
meet
twice
a
week
and
are
taught
by
intelligent
workingmen
who
apparently
give
the
boys
what
they
want
better
than
do
the
strictly
professional
teachers
while
these
classes
in
no
sense
provide
a
trade
training
they
often
enable
a
boy
to
discover
his
aptitude
and
help
him
in
the
selection
of
what
he
wants
to
be
by
reducing
the
trades
to
embryonic
forms
the
factories
are
so
complicated
that
the
boy
brought
in
contact
with
them
unless
he
has
some
preliminary
preparation
is
apt
to
become
confused
in
pedagogical
terms
he
loses
his
power
of
orderly
reaction
and
is
often
so
discouraged
or
so
overstimulated
in
his
very
first
years
of
factory
life
that
his
future
usefulness
is
seriously
impaired
one
of
chicago
most
significant
experiments
in
the
direction
of
correlating
the
schools
with
actual
industry
was
for
several
years
carried
on
in
a
public
school
building
situated
near
in
which
the
bricklayers
apprentices
were
taught
eight
hours
a
day
in
special
classes
during
the
season
this
early
public
school
venture
anticipated
the
very
successful
arrangement
later
carried
on
in
cincinnati
in
pittsburgh
and
in
chicago
itself
whereby
a
group
of
boys
at
work
in
a
factory
alternate
month
by
month
with
another
group
who
are
in
school
and
are
thus
intelligently
conducted
into
the
complicated
processes
of
modern
industry
but
for
a
certain
type
of
boy
who
has
been
demoralized
by
the
constant
change
and
excitement
of
street
life
even
these
apprenticeship
classes
are
too
strenuous
and
he
has
to
be
lured
into
the
path
of
knowledge
by
all
sorts
of
appeals
it
sometimes
happens
that
boys
are
held
in
the
classes
for
weeks
by
their
desire
for
the
excitement
of
placing
burglar
alarms
under
the
door
mats
but
to
enable
the
possessor
of
even
a
little
knowledge
to
thus
play
with
it
is
to
decoy
his
feet
at
least
through
the
first
steps
of
the
long
hard
road
of
learning
although
even
in
this
the
teacher
must
proceed
warily
a
typical
street
boy
who
was
utterly
absorbed
in
a
class
abruptly
left
never
to
return
when
he
was
told
to
use
some
simple
calculations
in
the
laying
out
of
the
points
he
evidently
scented
the
approach
of
his
old
enemy
arithmetic
and
fled
the
field
on
the
other
hand
we
have
come
across
many
cases
in
which
boys
have
vainly
tried
to
secure
such
opportunities
for
themselves
during
the
trial
of
a
boy
of
ten
recently
arrested
for
truancy
it
developed
that
he
had
spent
many
hours
watching
the
electrical
construction
in
a
downtown
building
and
many
others
in
the
public
library
reading
about
electricity
another
boy
who
was
taken
from
school
early
when
his
father
lost
both
of
his
legs
in
a
factory
accident
tried
in
vain
to
find
a
place
for
himself
with
machinery
he
was
declared
too
small
for
any
such
position
and
for
four
years
worked
as
an
errand
boy
during
which
time
he
steadily
turned
in
his
unopened
pay
envelope
for
the
use
of
the
household
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
the
boy
disappeared
to
the
great
distress
of
his
invalid
father
and
his
poor
mother
whose
day
washings
became
the
sole
support
of
the
family
he
had
beaten
his
way
to
kansas
city
hoping
they
would
be
so
particular
there
about
a
fellow
size
he
came
back
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
because
he
felt
sorry
for
his
mother
who
aroused
at
last
to
a
realization
of
his
unbending
purpose
applied
for
help
to
the
juvenile
protective
association
they
found
a
position
for
the
boy
in
a
machine
shop
and
an
opportunity
for
evening
classes
out
of
the
fifteen
hundred
members
of
the
boy
club
hundreds
seem
to
respond
only
to
the
opportunities
for
recreation
and
many
of
the
older
ones
apparently
care
only
for
the
bowling
and
the
billiards
and
yet
tournaments
and
match
games
under
supervision
and
regulated
hours
are
a
great
advance
over
the
sensual
and
exhausting
pleasures
to
be
found
so
easily
outside
the
club
these
organized
sports
readily
connect
themselves
with
the
gymnasium
and
with
all
those
enthusiasms
which
are
so
mysteriously
aroused
by
athletics
our
gymnasium
has
been
filled
with
large
and
enthusiastic
classes
for
eighteen
years
in
spite
of
the
popularity
of
dancing
and
other
possible
substitutes
while
the
saturday
evening
athletic
contests
have
become
a
feature
of
the
neighborhood
the
settlement
strives
for
that
type
of
gymnastics
which
is
at
least
partly
a
matter
of
character
for
that
training
which
presupposes
abstinence
and
the
curbing
of
impulse
as
well
as
for
those
athletic
contests
in
which
the
mind
of
the
contestant
must
be
vigilant
to
keep
the
body
closely
to
the
rules
of
the
game
as
one
sees
in
rhythmic
motion
the
slim
bodies
of
a
class
of
lads
that
scrupulous
and
uncontaminate
purity
of
form
which
recommended
itself
even
to
the
greeks
as
befitting
messengers
from
the
gods
if
such
messengers
should
come
one
offers
up
in
awkward
prosaic
form
the
very
essence
of
that
old
prayer
grant
them
with
feet
so
light
to
pass
through
life
but
while
the
glory
stored
up
for
olympian
winners
was
at
the
most
a
handful
of
parsley
an
ode
fame
for
family
and
city
on
the
other
hand
when
the
men
and
boys
from
the
gymnasium
bring
back
their
cups
and
medals
one
mind
is
filled
with
something
like
foreboding
in
the
reflection
that
too
much
success
may
lead
the
winners
into
the
professionalism
which
is
so
associated
with
betting
and
so
close
to
pugilism
candor
however
compels
me
to
state
that
a
long
acquaintance
with
the
acrobatic
folk
who
have
to
do
with
the
circus
a
large
number
of
whom
practice
in
our
gymnasium
every
winter
has
raised
our
estimate
of
that
profession
young
people
who
work
long
hours
at
sedentary
occupations
factories
and
offices
need
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
the
freedom
and
ease
to
be
acquired
from
a
symmetrical
muscular
development
and
are
quick
to
respond
to
that
fellowship
which
athletics
apparently
affords
more
easily
than
anything
else
the
greek
immigrants
form
large
classes
and
are
eager
to
reproduce
the
remnants
of
old
methods
of
wrestling
and
other
bits
of
classic
lore
which
they
still
possess
and
when
one
of
the
greeks
won
a
medal
in
a
wrestling
match
which
represented
the
championship
of
the
entire
city
it
was
quite
impossible
that
he
should
present
it
to
the
trophy
chest
without
a
classic
phrase
which
he
recited
most
gravely
and
charmingly
it
was
in
connection
with
a
large
association
of
greek
lads
that
finally
lifted
its
long
restriction
against
military
drill
if
athletic
contests
are
the
residuum
of
warfare
first
waged
against
the
conqueror
without
and
then
against
the
tyrants
within
the
state
the
modern
greek
youth
is
still
in
the
first
stage
so
far
as
his
inherited
attitude
against
the
turk
is
concerned
each
lad
believes
that
at
any
moment
he
may
be
called
home
to
fight
this
enemy
of
greece
with
such
a
genuine
motive
at
hand
it
seemed
mere
affectation
to
deny
the
use
of
our
boys
club
building
and
gymnasium
for
organized
drill
although
happily
it
forms
but
a
small
part
of
the
activities
of
the
greek
educational
association
having
thus
confessed
to
military
drill
countenanced
if
not
encouraged
at
it
is
perhaps
only
fair
to
relate
an
early
experience
of
mine
with
the
columbian
guards
and
organization
of
the
world
fair
summer
although
the
squad
was
organized
as
the
others
were
with
the
motto
of
a
clean
city
it
was
very
anxious
for
military
drill
this
request
not
only
shocked
my
nonresistant
principles
but
seemed
to
afford
an
opportunity
to
find
a
substitute
for
the
military
tactics
which
were
used
in
the
boys
brigades
everywhere
even
in
those
connected
with
churches
as
the
cleaning
of
the
filthy
streets
and
alleys
was
the
ostensible
purpose
of
the
columbian
guards
i
suggested
to
the
boys
that
we
work
out
a
drill
with
sewer
spades
which
with
their
long
narrow
blades
and
shortened
handles
were
not
so
unlike
bayoneted
guns
in
size
weight
and
general
appearance
but
that
much
of
the
usual
military
drill
could
be
readapted
while
i
myself
was
present
at
the
gymnasium
to
explain
that
it
was
nobler
to
drill
in
imitation
of
removing
filth
than
to
drill
in
simulation
of
warfare
while
i
distractedly
readapted
tales
of
chivalry
to
this
modern
rescuing
of
the
endangered
and
distressed
the
new
drill
went
forward
in
some
sort
of
fashion
but
so
surely
as
i
withdrew
the
drillmaster
would
complain
that
our
troops
would
first
grow
then
demoralized
and
finally
flatly
refuse
to
go
on
throughout
the
years
since
the
failure
of
this
quixotic
experiment
i
occasionally
find
one
of
these
sewer
spades
in
a
storeroom
too
truncated
to
be
used
for
its
original
purpose
and
too
prosaic
to
serve
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
bought
i
can
only
look
at
it
in
the
forlorn
hope
that
it
may
foreshadow
that
piping
time
when
the
weapons
of
warfare
shall
be
turned
into
the
implements
of
civic
salvation
before
closing
this
chapter
on
socialized
education
it
is
only
fair
to
speak
of
the
education
accruing
to
the
residents
themselves
during
their
years
of
living
in
what
at
least
purports
to
be
a
center
for
social
and
educational
activity
while
a
certain
number
of
the
residents
are
primarily
interested
in
charitable
administration
and
the
amelioration
which
can
be
suggested
only
by
those
who
know
actual
conditions
there
are
other
residents
identified
with
the
house
from
its
earlier
years
to
whom
the
groups
of
immigrants
make
the
historic
appeal
and
who
use
not
only
their
linguistic
ability
but
all
the
resource
they
can
command
of
travel
and
reading
to
qualify
themselves
for
intelligent
living
in
the
immigrant
quarter
of
the
city
i
remember
one
resident
lately
returned
from
a
visit
in
sicily
who
was
able
to
interpret
to
a
bewildered
judge
the
ancient
privilege
of
a
jilted
lover
to
scratch
the
cheek
of
his
faithless
sweetheart
with
the
edge
of
a
coin
although
the
custom
in
america
had
degenerated
into
a
knife
slashing
after
the
manner
of
foreign
customs
here
and
although
the
sicilian
deserved
punishment
the
incident
was
yet
lifted
out
of
the
slough
of
mere
brutal
assault
and
the
interpretation
won
the
gratitude
of
many
sicilians
there
is
no
doubt
that
residents
in
a
settlement
too
often
move
toward
their
ends
with
hurried
and
ignoble
gait
putting
forth
thorns
in
their
eagerness
to
bear
grapes
it
is
always
easy
for
those
in
pursuit
of
ends
which
they
consider
of
overwhelming
importance
to
become
themselves
thin
and
impoverished
in
spirit
and
temper
to
gradually
develop
a
dark
mistaken
eagerness
alternating
with
fatigue
which
supersedes
the
great
and
gracious
ways
so
much
more
congruous
with
worthy
aims
partly
because
of
this
universal
tendency
partly
because
a
settlement
shares
the
perplexities
of
its
times
and
is
never
too
dogmatic
concerning
the
final
truth
the
residents
would
be
glad
to
make
the
daily
life
at
the
settlement
conform
to
every
shape
and
mode
of
excellence
it
may
not
be
true
that
the
good
are
always
the
merry
save
by
an
evil
chance
but
a
settlement
would
make
clear
that
one
need
not
be
heartless
and
flippant
in
order
to
be
merry
nor
solemn
in
order
to
be
wise
therefore
quite
as
tries
to
redeem
billiard
tables
from
the
association
of
gambling
and
dancing
from
the
temptations
of
the
public
dance
halls
so
it
would
associate
with
a
life
of
upright
purpose
those
more
engaging
qualities
which
in
the
experience
of
the
neighborhood
are
too
often
connected
with
dubious
aims
throughout
the
history
of
many
inquiries
have
been
made
concerning
the
religion
of
the
residents
and
the
reply
that
they
are
as
diversified
in
belief
and
in
the
ardor
of
the
inner
life
as
any
like
number
of
people
in
a
college
or
similar
group
apparently
does
not
carry
conviction
i
recall
that
after
a
house
for
men
residents
had
been
opened
on
polk
street
and
the
residential
force
at
numbered
twenty
we
made
an
effort
to
come
together
on
sunday
evenings
in
a
household
service
hoping
thus
to
express
our
moral
unity
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
represented
many
creeds
but
although
all
of
us
reverently
knelt
when
the
high
church
resident
read
the
evening
service
and
bowed
our
heads
when
the
evangelical
resident
led
in
prayer
after
his
chapter
and
although
we
sat
respectfully
through
the
twilight
when
a
resident
read
her
favorite
passages
from
plato
and
another
from
abt
vogler
we
concluded
at
the
end
of
the
winter
that
this
was
not
religious
fellowship
and
that
we
did
not
care
for
another
reading
club
so
it
was
reluctantly
given
up
and
we
found
that
it
was
quite
as
necessary
to
come
together
on
the
basis
of
the
deed
and
our
common
aim
inside
the
household
as
it
was
in
the
neighborhood
itself
i
once
had
a
conversation
on
the
subject
with
the
warden
of
oxford
house
who
kindly
invited
me
to
the
evening
service
held
for
the
residents
in
a
little
chapel
on
the
top
floor
of
the
settlement
all
the
residents
were
high
churchmen
to
whom
the
service
was
an
important
and
reverent
part
of
the
day
upon
my
reply
to
a
query
of
the
warden
that
the
residents
of
could
not
come
together
for
religious
worship
because
there
were
among
us
jews
roman
catholics
english
churchmen
dissenters
and
a
few
agnostics
and
that
we
had
found
unsatisfactory
the
diluted
form
of
worship
which
we
could
carry
on
together
he
replied
that
it
must
be
most
difficult
to
work
with
a
group
so
diversified
for
he
depended
upon
the
evening
service
to
clear
away
any
difficulties
which
the
day
had
involved
and
to
bring
the
residents
to
a
religious
consciousness
of
their
common
aim
i
replied
that
this
diversity
of
creed
was
part
of
the
situation
in
american
settlements
as
it
was
our
task
to
live
in
a
neighborhood
of
many
nationalities
and
faiths
and
that
it
might
be
possible
that
among
such
diversified
people
it
was
better
that
the
settlement
corps
should
also
represent
varying
religious
beliefs
a
wise
man
has
told
us
that
men
are
once
for
all
so
made
that
they
prefer
a
rational
world
to
believe
in
and
to
live
in
but
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
find
a
world
rational
as
to
its
intellectual
aesthetic
moral
and
practical
aspects
certainly
it
is
no
easy
matter
if
the
place
selected
is
of
the
very
sort
where
the
four
aspects
are
apparently
furthest
from
perfection
but
an
undertaking
resembling
this
is
what
the
settlement
gradually
becomes
committed
to
as
its
function
is
revealed
through
the
reaction
on
its
consciousness
of
its
own
experiences
because
of
this
fourfold
undertaking
the
settlement
has
gathered
into
residence
people
of
widely
diversified
tastes
and
interests
and
in
at
least
the
group
has
been
surprisingly
permanent
the
majority
of
the
present
corp
of
forty
residents
support
themselves
by
their
business
and
professional
occupations
in
the
city
giving
only
their
leisure
time
to
settlement
undertakings
this
in
itself
tends
to
continuity
of
residence
and
has
certain
advantages
among
the
present
staff
of
whom
the
larger
number
have
been
in
residence
for
more
than
twelve
years
there
are
the
secretary
of
the
city
club
two
practicing
physicians
several
attorneys
newspapermen
businessmen
teachers
scientists
artists
musicians
lecturers
in
the
school
of
civics
and
philanthropy
officers
in
the
juvenile
protective
association
and
in
the
league
for
the
protection
of
immigrants
a
visiting
nurse
a
sanitary
inspector
and
others
we
have
also
worked
out
during
our
years
of
residence
a
plan
of
living
which
may
be
called
cooperative
for
the
families
and
individuals
who
rent
the
apartments
have
the
use
of
the
central
kitchen
and
dining
room
so
far
as
they
care
for
them
many
of
them
work
for
hours
every
week
in
the
studios
and
shops
the
theater
and
are
available
for
such
social
organization
as
they
care
to
form
the
entire
group
of
thirteen
buildings
is
heated
and
lighted
from
a
central
plant
during
the
years
the
common
human
experiences
have
gathered
about
the
house
funeral
services
have
been
held
there
marriages
and
christenings
and
many
memories
hold
us
to
each
other
as
well
as
to
our
neighbors
each
resident
of
course
carefully
defrays
his
own
expenses
and
his
relations
to
his
fellow
residents
are
not
unlike
those
of
a
college
professor
to
his
colleagues
the
depth
and
strength
of
his
relation
to
the
neighborhood
must
depend
very
largely
upon
himself
and
upon
the
genuine
friendships
he
has
been
able
to
make
his
relation
to
the
city
as
a
whole
comes
largely
through
his
identification
with
those
groups
who
are
carrying
forward
the
reforms
which
a
settlement
neighborhood
so
sadly
needs
and
with
which
residence
has
made
him
familiar
life
in
the
settlement
discovers
above
all
what
has
been
called
the
extraordinary
pliability
of
human
nature
and
it
seems
impossible
to
set
any
bounds
to
the
moral
capabilities
which
might
unfold
under
ideal
civic
and
educational
conditions
but
in
order
to
obtain
these
conditions
the
settlement
recognizes
the
need
of
cooperation
both
with
the
radical
and
the
conservative
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
the
settlement
can
not
limit
its
friends
to
any
one
political
party
or
economic
school
the
settlement
casts
side
none
of
those
things
which
cultivated
men
have
come
to
consider
reasonable
and
goodly
but
it
insists
that
those
belong
as
well
to
that
great
body
of
people
who
because
of
toilsome
and
underpaid
labor
are
unable
to
procure
them
for
themselves
added
to
this
is
a
profound
conviction
that
the
common
stock
of
intellectual
enjoyment
should
not
be
difficult
of
access
because
of
the
economic
position
of
him
who
would
approach
it
that
those
best
results
of
civilization
upon
which
depend
the
finer
and
freer
aspects
of
living
must
be
incorporated
into
our
common
life
and
have
free
mobility
through
all
elements
of
society
if
we
would
have
our
democracy
endure
the
educational
activities
of
a
settlement
as
well
its
philanthropic
civic
and
social
undertakings
are
but
differing
manifestations
of
the
attempt
to
socialize
democracy
as
is
the
very
existence
of
the
settlement
itself
