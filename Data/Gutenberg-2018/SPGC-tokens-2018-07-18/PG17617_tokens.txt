introduction
the
as
much
human
nature
in
some
folks
as
th
is
in
others
if
not
david
harum
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
characteristics
of
our
contemporary
native
fiction
is
an
increasing
tendency
to
subordinate
plot
or
story
to
the
bold
and
realistic
portrayal
of
some
of
the
types
of
american
life
and
manners
and
the
reason
for
this
is
not
far
to
seek
the
extraordinary
mixing
of
races
which
has
been
going
on
here
for
more
than
a
century
has
produced
an
enormously
diversified
human
result
and
the
products
of
this
hybridization
have
been
still
further
differentiated
by
an
environment
that
ranges
from
the
everglades
of
florida
to
the
glaciers
of
alaska
the
existence
of
these
conditions
and
the
great
literary
opportunities
which
they
contain
american
writers
long
ago
perceived
and
with
a
generally
true
appreciation
of
artistic
values
they
have
created
from
them
a
gallery
of
brilliant
pictures
which
stand
for
the
highest
we
have
yet
attained
in
the
art
of
fiction
thus
it
is
that
we
have
to
mention
but
a
few
studies
of
louisiana
and
her
people
by
cable
of
virginia
and
georgia
by
thomas
nelson
page
and
joel
chandler
harris
of
new
england
by
miss
jewett
and
miss
wilkins
of
the
middle
west
by
miss
french
octave
thanet
of
the
great
northwest
by
hamlin
garland
of
canada
and
the
land
of
the
by
gilbert
parker
and
finally
though
really
first
in
point
of
time
the
and
their
successors
by
bret
harte
this
list
might
be
indefinitely
extended
for
it
is
growing
daily
but
it
is
long
enough
as
it
stands
to
show
that
every
section
of
our
country
has
or
soon
will
have
its
own
painter
and
historian
whose
works
will
live
and
become
a
permanent
part
of
our
literature
in
just
the
degree
that
they
are
artistically
true
some
of
these
writers
have
already
produced
many
books
while
others
have
gained
general
recognition
and
even
fame
by
the
vividness
and
power
of
a
single
study
like
howe
with
the
story
of
a
country
town
but
each
one
it
will
be
noticed
has
chosen
for
his
field
of
work
that
part
of
our
country
wherein
he
passed
the
early
and
formative
years
of
his
life
a
natural
selection
that
is
perhaps
an
unconscious
affirmation
of
david
harum
aphorism
hoss
do
a
thing
better
spryer
if
he
ben
broke
to
it
as
a
colt
in
the
case
of
the
present
volume
the
conditions
are
identical
with
those
just
mentioned
most
of
the
scenes
are
laid
in
central
new
york
where
the
author
edward
noyes
westcott
was
born
september
and
where
he
died
of
consumption
march
nearly
all
his
life
was
passed
in
his
native
city
of
syracuse
and
although
banking
and
not
authorship
was
the
occupation
of
his
active
years
yet
his
sensitive
and
impressionable
temperament
had
become
so
saturated
with
the
local
atmosphere
and
his
retentive
memory
so
charged
with
facts
that
when
at
length
he
took
up
the
pen
he
was
able
to
create
in
david
harum
a
character
so
original
so
true
and
so
strong
yet
withal
so
delightfully
quaint
and
humorous
that
we
are
at
once
compelled
to
admit
that
here
is
a
new
and
permanent
addition
to
the
long
list
of
american
literary
portraits
the
book
is
a
novel
and
throughout
it
runs
a
love
story
which
is
characterized
by
sympathetic
treatment
and
a
constantly
increasing
interest
but
the
title
r√¥le
is
taken
by
the
old
country
banker
david
harum
dry
quaint
somewhat
illiterate
no
doubt
but
possessing
an
amazing
amount
of
knowledge
not
found
in
printed
books
and
holding
fast
to
the
cheerful
belief
that
there
is
nothing
wholly
bad
or
useless
in
this
world
or
in
his
own
words
a
reasonable
amount
of
fleas
is
good
for
a
dog
they
keep
him
f
broodin
on
bein
a
dog
this
country
banker
and
reputed
shylock
but
real
philanthropist
is
an
accurate
portrayal
of
a
type
that
exists
in
the
rural
districts
of
central
new
york
variations
of
him
may
be
seen
daily
driving
about
in
their
road
wagons
or
seated
in
their
bank
parlors
shrewd
honest
as
the
sunlight
from
most
points
of
view
but
in
a
horse
trade
much
inclined
to
follow
the
rule
laid
down
by
harum
himself
for
such
transactions
do
unto
the
other
feller
the
way
he
like
to
do
unto
you
an
do
it
fust
the
genial
humor
and
sunny
atmosphere
which
pervade
these
pages
are
in
dramatic
contrast
with
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
written
the
book
was
finished
while
the
author
lay
upon
his
deathbed
but
happily
for
the
reader
no
trace
of
his
sufferings
appears
here
it
was
not
granted
that
he
should
live
to
see
his
work
in
its
present
completed
form
a
consummation
he
most
earnestly
desired
but
it
seems
not
unreasonable
to
hope
that
the
result
of
his
labors
will
be
appreciated
and
that
david
harum
will
endure

chapter
david
poured
half
of
his
second
cup
of
tea
into
his
saucer
to
lower
its
temperature
to
the
drinking
point
and
helped
himself
to
a
second
cut
of
ham
and
a
third
egg
whatever
was
on
his
mind
to
have
kept
him
unusually
silent
during
the
evening
meal
and
to
cause
certain
wrinkles
in
his
forehead
suggestive
of
perplexity
or
misgiving
had
not
impaired
his
appetite
david
was
what
he
called
a
good
feeder
bixbee
known
to
most
of
those
who
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
her
acquaintance
as
aunt
polly
though
nieces
and
nephews
of
her
blood
there
were
none
in
homeville
freeland
county
looked
curiously
at
her
brother
as
in
fact
she
had
done
at
intervals
during
the
repast
and
concluding
at
last
that
further
forbearance
was
uncalled
for
relieved
the
pressure
of
her
curiosity
thus
guess
ye
got
somethin
on
your
mind
hai
ye
you
hai
hardly
said
aye
yes
ner
no
sence
you
set
down
anythin
gone
david
lifted
his
saucer
gave
the
contents
a
precautionary
blow
and
emptied
it
with
sundry
windy
suspirations
no
he
said
nothin
hai
gone
wrong
ye
might
say
not
yet
but
i
done
that
thing
i
was
tellin
ye
of
done
what
thing
she
asked
perplexedly
i
telegraphed
to
new
york
he
replied
fer
that
young
feller
to
come
on
the
young
man
general
wolsey
wrote
me
about
i
got
a
letter
from
him
an
i
made
up
my
mind
sooner
the
quicker
an
i
telegraphed
him
to
come
soon
he
could
i
forgit
what
you
said
his
name
was
said
aunt
polly
there
his
letter
said
david
handing
it
across
the
table
read
it
out
you
read
it
she
said
passing
it
back
after
a
search
in
her
pocket
i
must
left
my
specs
in
the
the
letter
was
as
follows
dear
sir
i
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
at
the
instance
of
general
wolsey
who
spoke
to
me
of
the
matter
of
your
communication
to
him
and
was
kind
enough
to
say
that
he
would
write
you
in
my
behalf
my
acquaintance
with
him
has
been
in
the
nature
of
a
social
rather
than
a
business
one
and
i
fancy
that
he
can
only
recommend
me
on
general
grounds
i
will
say
therefore
that
i
have
had
some
experience
with
accounts
but
not
much
practice
in
them
for
nearly
three
years
nevertheless
unless
the
work
you
wish
done
is
of
an
intricate
nature
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
accomplish
it
with
such
posting
at
the
outset
as
most
strangers
would
require
general
wolsey
told
me
that
you
wanted
some
one
as
soon
as
possible
i
have
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
starting
at
once
if
you
desire
to
have
me
a
telegram
addressed
to
me
at
the
office
of
the
trust
company
will
reach
me
promptly
yours
very
truly
john
k
lenox
said
david
looking
over
his
glasses
at
his
sister
what
do
you
think
o
the
ai
much
brag
i
she
replied
thoughtfully
no
said
david
putting
his
eyeglasses
back
in
their
case
th
no
brag
ner
no
promises
he
do
even
say
he
do
his
best
like
most
fellers
would
he
seems
to
have
took
it
fer
granted
that
i
take
it
fer
granted
an
that
what
i
like
about
it
he
added
the
thing
done
an
i
be
lookin
fer
him
mornin
or
at
latest
bixbee
sat
for
a
moment
with
her
large
light
blue
and
rather
prominent
eyes
fixed
on
her
brother
face
and
then
she
said
with
a
slight
undertone
of
anxiety
was
you
to
have
that
young
man
from
new
york
come
here
i
had
no
such
idee
he
replied
with
a
slight
smile
aware
of
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
what
put
that
in
your
head
she
answered
you
know
the
ai
scarcely
anybody
in
the
village
that
takes
boarders
in
the
winter
an
i
was
wonderin
what
he
would
do
i
he
go
to
the
eagle
said
david
i
dunno
where
else
it
to
the
lake
house
the
eagil
she
exclaimed
contemptuously
land
sakes
comin
here
from
new
york
he
wo
stan
it
there
a
week
replied
david
mebbe
he
will
an
mebbe
he
wo
but
i
see
what
else
the
is
for
it
an
i
guess
kill
him
for
a
spell
the
fact
is
he
was
proceeding
when
bixbee
interrupted
him
i
guess
we
better
adjourn
t
the
an
let
sairy
clear
off
the
she
said
rising
and
going
into
the
kitchen
what
was
you
sayin
she
asked
as
she
presently
found
her
brother
in
the
apartment
designated
and
seated
herself
with
her
in
her
lap
the
fact
is
i
was
sayin
he
resumed
sitting
with
hand
and
forearm
resting
on
a
round
table
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
large
kerosene
lamp
that
my
notion
was
fust
off
to
have
him
come
here
but
when
i
come
to
think
o
i
changed
my
mind
in
the
fust
place
except
that
he
well
recommended
i
do
know
nothin
about
him
an
in
the
second
i
are
pretty
well
set
in
our
ways
an
git
along
all
right
just
as
we
be
i
may
want
the
young
feller
to
stay
an
then
agin
i
may
not
we
see
it
a
good
sight
easier
to
git
a
fishhook
in
is
to
git
it
out
i
expect
he
find
it
putty
tough
at
first
but
if
he
a
feller
that
be
drove
out
of
by
a
spell
of
the
eagle
tavern
he
ai
the
feller
i
lookin
fer
though
i
will
allow
he
added
with
a
grimace
that
it
be
a
putty
hard
test
but
if
i
want
to
say
to
him
after
tryin
him
a
spell
that
i
guess
me
an
him
do
seem
likely
to
hitch
we
both
take
it
easier
if
we
ai
livin
in
the
same
house
i
guess
i
take
a
look
at
the
trybune
said
david
unfolding
that
paper
bixbee
went
on
with
her
needlework
with
an
occasional
side
glance
at
her
brother
who
was
immersed
in
the
gospel
of
his
politics
twice
or
thrice
she
opened
her
lips
as
if
to
address
him
but
apparently
some
restraining
thought
interposed
finally
the
impulse
to
utter
her
mind
culminated
dave
she
said
d
you
know
what
deakin
perkins
is
about
ye
david
opened
his
paper
so
as
to
hide
his
face
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
as
he
asked
in
return
what
the
deakin
now
he
sayin
she
replied
in
a
voice
mixed
of
indignation
and
apprehension
thet
you
sold
him
a
balky
horse
an
he
goin
to
hev
the
law
on
ye
david
shoulders
shook
behind
the
sheltering
page
and
his
mouth
expanded
in
a
grin
he
replied
after
a
moment
lowering
the
paper
and
looking
gravely
at
his
companion
over
his
glasses
next
to
the
religious
experience
them
of
lawin
an
air
his
strongest
an
he
works
the
hull
on
to
once
sometimes
the
evasiveness
of
this
generality
was
not
lost
on
bixbee
and
she
pressed
the
point
with
did
ye
an
will
he
yes
an
no
an
mebbe
an
mebbe
not
was
the
categorical
reply
she
answered
with
a
snap
mebbe
you
call
that
an
answer
i
if
you
do
want
to
let
on
you
wo
but
i
do
believe
ben
playin
some
trick
on
the
deakin
an
wo
own
up
i
do
wish
she
added
that
if
you
hed
to
git
rid
of
a
balky
horse
onto
somebody
hev
picked
out
somebody
else
when
you
got
a
balker
to
dispose
of
said
david
gravely
you
alwus
pick
an
choose
fust
come
fust
served
then
he
went
on
more
seriously
now
i
tell
ye
quite
a
while
ago
in
fact
not
long
after
i
come
to
enjoy
the
of
the
deakin
acquaintance
we
hed
a
deal
i
was
jest
on
my
guard
knowin
him
to
be
a
deakin
all
that
an
he
lied
to
me
so
splendid
that
i
was
took
in
clean
over
my
head
he
done
me
so
brown
i
was
burnt
in
places
an
you
c
smell
smoke
me
fer
some
time
was
it
a
horse
asked
bixbee
gratuitously
david
replied
mebbe
it
ben
some
time
but
at
that
time
the
only
thing
to
determine
that
fact
was
that
it
nothin
else
i
declare
exclaimed
bixbee
wondering
not
more
at
the
deacon
turpitude
than
at
the
lapse
in
david
acuteness
of
which
she
had
an
immense
opinion
but
commenting
only
on
the
former
i
at
the
deakin
yes
said
david
with
a
grin
i
quite
a
liar
myself
when
it
comes
right
down
to
the
hoss
but
the
deakin
give
me
both
bowers
hand
he
done
it
so
slick
that
i
had
to
laugh
when
i
come
to
think
it
over
an
i
had
witnesses
to
the
hull
confab
too
that
he
know
of
an
i
c
showed
him
up
in
great
shape
if
i
had
a
mind
to
why
did
ye
said
aunt
polly
whose
feelings
about
the
deacon
were
undergoing
a
revulsion
to
tell
ye
the
truth
i
was
so
completely
skunked
that
i
a
word
to
say
i
got
rid
o
the
thing
fer
what
it
was
wuth
fer
hide
taller
an
stid
of
squealin
the
way
you
say
he
doin
like
a
stuck
pig
i
kep
my
tongue
between
my
teeth
an
laid
to
git
even
some
time
you
ort
to
hed
the
law
on
him
declared
bixbee
now
fully
converted
the
old
scamp
was
the
reply
i
prefer
to
settle
out
of
court
an
in
this
case
while
i
might
ben
willin
t
admit
that
i
hed
ben
did
up
i
did
feel
much
like
swearin
to
it
i
reckoned
the
time
come
when
mebbe
i
git
the
laugh
on
the
deakin
an
it
did
we
putty
well
settled
now
in
full

last
pufformance

bixbee

to
stan
it

she

encouragingly
seein

had
gettin
ye
started
did
ye
find
out
them
fellers
i
ast
the
barn
man
if

of

he
says
dave
said
bixbee
them

laid
fer
ye

they
i
reckon
they
did
he
admitted
an
they
was
as
slick
a
pair
as
was
ever
drawed
to
which
expression
was
lost
upon
his
sister
david
rubbed
the
fringe
of
hair
which
encircled
his
bald
pate
for
a
moment
he
resumed
after
the
talk
with
the
barn
man
i
smelt
woolen
ever
but
i
did
say
nothin
an
had
the
mare
hitched
started
back
old
jinny
drives
with
one
hand
an
i
c
watch
the
new
one
all
right
an
as
we
come
along
i
begun
to
think
i
stuck
after
all
i
never
see
a
hoss
travel
evener
an
nicer
an
when
we
come
to
a
good
level
place
i
sent
the
old
mare
along
the
best
she
knew
the
new
one
never
broke
his
gait
an
kep
right
up
half
tryin
an
jinny
do
take
most
folks
dust
neither
i
swan
i
got
home
i
reckoned
i
jest
as
good
as
made
anyway
chapter
ii
then
the
nothin
the
matter
with
him
after
all
commented
bixbee
in
rather
a
disappointed
tone
the
meanest
thing
top
of
the
earth
was
the
matter
with
him
declared
david
but
i
did
find
it
out
till
the
next
afternoon
an
then
i
found
it
out
good
i
hitched
him
to
the
open
buggy
an
went
by
the
east
road
that
ai
so
much
travelled
he
went
along
all
right
till
we
got
a
mile
or
so
out
of
the
village
an
then
i
slowed
him
down
to
a
walk
sir
scat
my
he
had
walked
a
rod
he
come
to
a
dead
i
clucked
an
an
finely
took
the
gad
to
him
a
little
but
he
only
jest
kind
o
humped
up
a
little
an
stood
like
he
took
root
now
exclaimed
bixbee
yes
said
david
i
was
stuck
in
sense
of
the
word
what
d
do
i
tried
all
the
tricks
i
knowed
an
i
could
lead
him
but
when
i
was
in
the
buggy
he
would
stir
till
he
got
good
an
ready
then
he
start
of
his
own
accord
an
go
on
a
spell
an
did
he
keep
it
up
bixbee
interrupted
i
s
say
he
did
i
finely
got
home
with
the
critter
but
i
thought
one
time
i
either
hev
to
lead
him
or
spend
the
night
on
the
east
road
he
balked
five
times
varyin
in
length
an
it
was
dark
when
we
struck
the
barn
i
should
hev
thought
you
a
wanted
to
kill
him
said
bixbee
an
the
fellers
that
sold
him
to
ye
too
the
times
david
replied
with
a
nod
of
his
head
when
if
a
fell
down
dead
i
would
hev
figgered
on
puttin
a
band
on
my
hat
but
it
do
never
pay
to
git
mad
with
a
hoss
an
as
fur
the
feller
i
bought
him
of
when
i
remembered
how
he
told
me
he
stand
without
hitchin
i
swan
i
had
to
laugh
i
did
fer
a
fact
without
hitchin
he
he
he
i
guess
you
would
think
it
was
so
awful
funny
if
you
had
gone
stuck
that
horse
onto
deakin
perkins
an
i
do
see
how
you
done
it
mebbe
that
part
of
the
joke
david
allowed
an
i
tell
ye
rest
o
th
next
day
i
hitched
the
new
one
to
th
wagin
put
in
a
lot
of
straps
an
rope
an
started
off
fer
the
east
road
agin
he
went
fust
rate
till
we
come
to
about
the
place
where
we
had
the
fust
trouble
an
sure
enough
he
balked
agin
i
leaned
over
an
hit
him
a
smart
cut
on
the
off
shoulder
but
he
only
humped
a
little
an
never
lifted
a
foot
i
hit
him
another
lick
with
the
selfsame
result
then
i
got
down
an
i
strapped
that
animal
he
could
move
nothin
but
his
head
an
tail
an
got
back
into
the
buggy
it
may
ben
ten
minutes
or
it
may
ben
more
or
less
it
slow
work
settin
still
behind
a
balkin
hoss
he
was
ready
to
go
on
his
own
account
but
he
could
budge
he
kind
o
looked
around
much
as
to
say
on
earth
the
matter
an
then
he
tried
another
move
then
another
but
no
go
then
i
got
down
an
took
the
hopples
off
then
climbed
back
into
the
buggy
an
says
to
him
an
off
he
stepped
as
chipper
as
could
be
an
we
went
joggin
along
all
right
mebbe
two
mile
an
when
i
slowed
up
up
he
come
agin
i
gin
him
another
clip
in
the
same
place
on
the
shoulder
an
i
got
down
an
tied
him
up
agin
an
the
same
thing
happened
as
before
it
did
take
him
quite
so
long
to
make
up
his
mind
about
startin
an
we
went
some
further
without
a
hitch
but
i
had
to
go
through
the
pufformance
the
third
time
before
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
if
he
did
go
when
wanted
he
could
go
when
wanted
an
that
did
suit
him
when
he
felt
the
whip
on
his
shoulder
it
meant
was
that
the
end
of
his
balkin
asked
bixbee
i
had
to
give
him
one
more
said
david
an
after
that
i
did
have
no
more
trouble
with
him
he
showed
symptoms
at
times
but
a
touch
of
the
whip
on
the
shoulder
alwus
fetched
him
i
alwus
carried
them
straps
though
till
the
last
two
or
three
times
what
the
deakin
kickin
about
then
asked
aunt
polly
you
jest
sayin

david
slowly

balk
with
some
folks

most
alwus
tell
did
the
deakin
have
a
chance

an
all

i
he
says

an
yit
mebbe

haw
about
so
much
an
he
rode
a
mile
an
a
half
livelier
he
done
in
a
good
while
i
reckon
he
had
to
pull
that
old
of
down
to
his
ears
an
do
you
fergit
it
he
he
he
he
the
road
was
jest
o
hosses
we
drove
into
the
yard
an
i
told
the
hired
man
to
unhitch
the
bay
hoss
an
fetch
out
the
roan
an
while
he
was
bein
unhitched
the
deakin
stood
an
never
took
his
eyes
him
an
i
knowed
i
would
sell
the
deakin
no
roan
hoss
day
even
if
i
wanted
to
but
when
he
come
out
i
begun
to
crack
him
up
an
i
talked
hoss
fer
all
i
was
wuth
the
deakin
looked
him
over
in
a
kind
of
a
way
an
did
give
much
heed
to
what
i
was
sayin
finely
i
says
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
says
seems
to
be
a
likely
enough
critter
but
i
do
believe
he
suit
white
not
he
says
you
askin
fer
him
he
says
i
says
he
a
cheap
hoss
at
the
money
but
added
the
speaker
with
a
laugh
i
knowed
i
might
well
of
said
a
thousan
the
deakin
buyin
no
roan
colts
that
mornin
what
did
he
say
asked
bixbee
he
says
i
guess
you

to
git
that
much
fer

but
i
he
ai
what
white
wants
an
then
quite
a
hoss
we

long

little
he
says

fer
white
if
he
all
right
jest
as
soon

i
go
an
fetch
him
out
i
says
so
i

chapter
iii
master
jacky
carling
was
a
very
nice
boy
but
not
at
that
time
in
his
career
the
safest
person
to
whom
to
intrust
a
missive
in
case
its
sure
and
speedy
delivery
were
a
matter
of
importance
but
he
protested
with
so
much
earnestness
and
good
will
that
it
should
be
put
into
the
very
first
he
came
to
on
his
way
to
school
and
that
nothing
could
induce
him
to
forget
it
that
mary
blake
his
aunt
confidante
and
not
unfrequently
counsel
and
advocate
gave
it
him
to
post
and
dismissed
the
matter
from
her
mind
unfortunately
the
weather
which
had
been
very
frosty
had
changed
in
the
night
to
a
mildness
as
jacky
opened
the
door
three
or
four
of
his
were
passing
he
felt
the
softness
of
the
spring
morning
and
to
their
injunction
to
hurry
up
and
come
along
replied
with
an
entreaty
to
wait
a
minute
till
he
left
his
overcoat
all
boys
hate
an
overcoat
and
plunged
back
into
the
house
if
john
lenox
john
knox
lenox
had
received
miss
blake
note
of
condolence
and
sympathy
written
in
reply
to
his
own
wherein
besides
speaking
of
his
bereavement
he
had
made
allusion
to
some
changes
in
his
prospects
and
some
necessary
alterations
in
his
ways
for
a
time
he
might
perhaps
have
read
between
the
lines
something
more
than
merely
a
kind
expression
of
her
sorrow
for
the
trouble
which
had
come
upon
him
and
the
reminder
that
he
had
friends
who
if
they
could
not
do
more
to
lessen
his
grief
would
give
him
their
truest
sympathy
and
if
some
days
later
he
had
received
a
second
note
saying
that
she
and
her
people
were
about
to
go
away
for
some
months
and
asking
him
to
come
and
see
them
before
their
departure
it
is
possible
that
very
many
things
set
forth
in
this
narrative
would
not
have
happened
life
had
always
been
made
easy
for
john
lenox
and
his
was
not
the
temperament
to
interpose
obstacles
to
the
process
a
course
at
andover
had
been
followed
by
two
years
at
princeton
but
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
practical
life
ought
to
begin
for
him
and
he
had
thought
it
rather
fine
of
himself
to
undertake
a
clerkship
in
the
office
of
rush
where
in
the
ensuing
year
and
a
half
or
so
though
he
took
his
work
in
moderation
he
got
a
fair
knowledge
of
accounts
and
the
ways
and
methods
of
the
street
but
that
period
of
it
was
enough
he
found
himself
not
only
regretting
the
abandonment
of
his
college
career
but
feeling
that
the
thing
for
which
he
had
given
it
up
had
been
rather
a
waste
of
time
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
though
he
had
entered
college
later
than
most
even
now
a
further
acquaintance
with
and
professors
was
more
to
be
desired
than
with
ledgers
and
brokers
his
father
somewhat
to
his
wonderment
and
possibly
a
little
to
his
chagrin
seemed
rather
to
welcome
the
suggestion
that
he
spend
a
couple
of
years
in
europe
taking
some
lectures
at
heidelberg
or
elsewhere
and
traveling
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
he
acquired
a
pretty
fair
working
acquaintance
with
german
brought
his
knowledge
of
french
up
to
about
the
same
point
and
came
back
at
the
end
of
two
years
with
a
fine
and
discriminating
taste
in
beer
and
a
scar
over
his
left
eyebrow
which
could
be
seen
if
attention
were
called
to
it
he
started
upon
his
return
without
any
definite
intentions
or
for
any
special
reason
except
that
he
had
gone
away
for
two
years
and
that
the
two
years
were
up
he
had
carried
on
a
desultory
correspondence
with
his
father
who
had
replied
occasionally
rather
briefly
but
on
the
whole
affectionately
he
had
noticed
that
during
the
latter
part
of
his
stay
abroad
the
replies
had
been
more
than
usually
irregular
but
had
attributed
no
special
significance
to
the
fact
it
was
not
until
afterward
that
it
occurred
to
him
that
in
all
their
correspondence
his
father
had
never
alluded
in
any
way
to
his
return
on
the
passenger
list
of
the
altruria
john
came
upon
the
names
of
and
julius
carling
and
miss
blake
blake
blake
he
said
to
himself
carling
i
seem
to
remember
to
have
known
that
name
at
some
time
it
must
be
little
mary
blake
whom
i
knew
as
a
small
girl
years
ago
and
yes
carling
was
the
name
of
the
man
her
sister
married
well
well
i
wonder
what
she
is
like
of
course
i
should
know
her
from
eve
now
or
she
me
from
adam
all
i
can
remember
seems
to
be
a
pair
of
very
slim
and
active
legs
a
lot
of
flying
hair
a
pair
of
or
eyes
and
that
i
thought
her
a
very
nice
girl
as
girls
went
but
it
does
in
the
least
follow
that
i
might
think
so
now
and
shipboard
is
pretty
close
quarters
for
seven
or
eight
days
dinner
is
by
all
odds
the
chief
event
of
the
day
on
board
ship
to
those
who
are
able
to
dine
and
they
will
leave
all
other
attractions
even
the
surpassingly
interesting
things
which
go
on
in
the
at
once
on
the
sound
of
the
gong
of
promise
on
this
first
night
of
the
voyage
the
ship
was
still
in
smooth
water
at
dinner
time
and
many
a
place
was
occupied
which
would
know
its
occupant
for
the
first
and
very
possibly
for
the
last
time
the
passenger
list
was
fairly
large
but
not
full
john
had
assigned
to
him
a
seat
at
a
side
table
he
was
hungry
having
had
no
luncheon
but
a
couple
of
biscuits
and
a
glass
of
bitter
and
was
taking
his
first
mouthful
of
after
the
soup
and
scanning
the
dinner
card
when
the
people
at
his
table
came
in
the
man
of
the
trio
was
obviously
an
invalid
of
the
nervous
variety
and
the
most
decided
type
the
small
dark
woman
who
took
the
corner
seat
at
his
left
was
undoubtedly
from
the
solicitous
way
in
which
she
adjusted
a
small
shawl
about
his
shoulders
to
his
querulous
uneasiness
his
wife
there
was
a
good
deal
of
white
in
the
dark
hair
brushed
smoothly
back
from
her
face
a
tall
girl
with
a
mass
of
brown
hair
under
a
felt
traveling
hat
took
the
corner
seat
at
the
man
right
that
was
all
the
detail
of
her
appearance
which
the
brief
glance
that
john
allowed
himself
revealed
to
him
at
the
moment
notwithstanding
the
justifiable
curiosity
which
he
had
with
regard
to
the
people
with
whom
he
was
likely
to
come
more
or
less
in
contact
for
a
number
of
days
but
though
their
faces
so
far
as
he
had
seen
them
were
unfamiliar
to
him
their
identity
was
made
plain
to
him
by
the
first
words
which
caught
his
ear
there
were
two
soups
on
the
and
the
man
mind
instantly
poised
itself
between
them
which
soup
shall
i
take
he
asked
turning
with
a
frown
of
uncertainty
to
his
wife
i
should
say
the
julius
was
the
reply
i
thought
i
should
like
the
broth
better
he
objected
i
do
think
it
will
disagree
with
you
she
said
perhaps
i
had
better
have
the
he
argued
looking
with
appeal
to
his
wife
and
then
to
the
girl
at
his
right
which
would
you
take
mary
i
said
the
young
woman
i
should
take
both
in
my
present
state
of
steward
bring
both
what
wine
shall
i
order
for
you
julius
i
want
some
champagne
and
i
prescribe
it
for
you
after
your
mental
struggle
over
the
soup
question
you
need
a
quick
stimulant
do
you
think
a
red
wine
would
be
better
for
me
he
asked
or
perhaps
some
sauterne
i
afraid
that
i
go
to
sleep
if
i
drink
champagne
in
fact
i
do
think
i
had
better
take
any
wine
at
all
perhaps
some
ginger
ale
or
apollinaris
water
no
she
said
decisively
whatever
you
decide
upon
you
know
that
you
think
whatever
i
have
better
for
you
and
i
shall
want
more
than
one
glass
and
alice
wants
some
too
oh
yes
you
do
and
i
shall
order
a
quart
of
steward
giving
her
order
please
be
as
quick
as
you
can
john
had
by
this
fully
identified
his
neighbors
and
the
talk
which
ensued
between
them
consisting
mostly
of
controversies
between
the
invalid
and
his
family
over
the
items
of
the
bill
of
fare
every
course
being
discussed
as
to
its
probable
effect
upon
his
stomach
or
his
nerves
the
question
being
usually
settled
with
a
whimsical
by
the
young
woman
gave
him
a
pretty
good
notion
of
their
relations
and
the
state
of
affairs
in
general
notwithstanding
miss
blake
benevolent
despotism
the
invalid
was
still
wrangling
feebly
over
some
last
dish
when
john
rose
and
went
to
the
smoking
room
for
his
coffee
and
cigarette
when
he
stumbled
out
in
search
of
his
bath
the
next
morning
the
steamer
was
well
out
and
rolling
and
pitching
in
a
way
calculated
to
disturb
the
gastric
functions
of
the
hardiest
but
after
a
shower
of
sea
water
and
a
rub
down
he
found
himself
with
a
feeling
for
bacon
and
eggs
that
made
him
proud
of
himself
and
he
went
in
to
breakfast
to
find
rather
to
his
surprise
that
miss
blake
was
before
him
looking
as
fresh
well
as
fresh
as
a
handsome
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
and
in
perfect
health
could
look
she
acknowledged
his
perfunctory
bow
as
he
took
his
seat
with
a
stiff
little
bend
of
the
head
but
later
on
when
the
steward
was
absent
on
some
order
he
elicited
a
thank
you
by
handing
her
something
which
he
saw
she
wanted
and
one
thing
leading
to
another
as
things
have
a
way
of
doing
where
young
and
attractive
people
are
concerned
they
were
presently
engaged
in
an
interchange
of
small
talk
but
before
john
was
moved
to
the
point
of
disclosing
himself
on
the
warrant
of
a
former
acquaintance
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
the
weather
continued
very
stormy
for
two
days
and
during
that
time
miss
blake
did
not
appear
at
table
at
any
rate
if
she
breakfasted
there
it
was
either
before
or
after
his
appearance
and
he
learned
afterward
that
she
had
taken
luncheon
and
dinner
in
her
sister
room
the
morning
of
the
third
day
broke
bright
and
clear
there
was
a
long
swell
upon
the
sea
but
the
motion
of
the
boat
was
even
and
endurable
to
all
but
the
most
susceptible
as
the
morning
advanced
the
deck
began
to
fill
with
promenaders
and
to
be
lined
with
chairs
holding
figures
showing
faces
of
all
shades
of
green
and
gray
john
walking
for
exercise
and
at
a
wholly
unnecessary
pace
turning
at
a
sharp
angle
around
the
deck
house
fairly
ran
into
the
girl
about
whom
he
had
been
wondering
for
the
last
two
days
she
received
his
somewhat
incoherent
apologies
regrets
and
in
such
a
spirit
of
forgiveness
that
before
long
they
were
supplementing
their
first
conversation
with
something
more
personal
and
satisfactory
and
when
he
came
to
the
point
of
saying
that
half
by
accident
he
had
found
out
her
name
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
tell
her
his
own
she
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
of
frank
amusement
and
said
it
is
quite
unnecessary
lenox
i
knew
you
instantly
when
i
saw
you
at
table
the
first
night
but
she
added
mischievously
i
am
afraid
your
memory
for
people
you
have
known
is
not
so
good
as
mine
well
said
john
you
will
admit
i
think
that
the
change
from
a
little
girl
in
short
frocks
to
a
tall
young
woman
in
a
gown
might
be
more
disguising
than
what
might
happen
with
a
boy
of
fifteen
or
so
i
saw
your
name
in
the
passenger
list
with
and
carling
and
wondered
if
it
could
be
the
mary
blake
whom
i
really
did
remember
and
the
first
night
at
dinner
when
i
heard
your
sister
call
carling
and
heard
him
call
you
i
was
sure
of
you
but
i
hardly
got
a
fair
look
at
your
face
and
indeed
i
confess
that
if
i
had
had
no
clew
at
all
i
might
not
have
recognized
you
i
think
you
would
have
been
quite
excusable
she
replied
and
whether
you
would
or
would
not
have
known
me
is
of
those
things
that
no
fellow
can
find
out
and
is
of
supreme
importance
anyway
we
each
know
who
the
other
is
now
at
all
events
yes
said
john
i
am
happy
to
think
that
we
have
come
to
a
conclusion
on
that
point
but
how
does
it
happen
that
i
have
heard
nothing
of
you
all
these
years
or
you
of
me
as
i
suppose
for
the
reason
i
fancy
she
replied
that
during
that
period
of
short
frocks
with
me
my
sister
married
carling
and
took
me
with
her
to
chicago
where
carling
was
in
business
we
have
been
back
in
new
york
only
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
it
might
have
been
on
the
cards
that
i
should
come
across
you
in
europe
said
john
the
beaten
track
is
not
very
broad
how
long
have
you
been
over
only
about
six
months
she
replied
we
have
been
at
one
or
another
of
the
german
spas
most
of
the
time
as
we
went
abroad
for
health
and
we
are
on
our
way
home
on
about
such
an
impulse
as
that
which
started
us
off
he
thinks
now
that
he
will
be
better
off
there
i
am
afraid
you
have
not
derived
much
pleasure
from
your
european
experiences
said
john
pleasure
she
exclaimed
if
ever
you
saw
a
young
woman
who
was
glad
and
thankful
to
turn
her
face
toward
home
am
that
person
i
think
that
one
of
the
heaviest
crosses
humanity
has
to
bear
is
to
have
constantly
to
decide
between
two
or
more
absolutely
trivial
conclusions
in
one
own
affairs
but
when
one
is
called
upon
to
multiply
useless
perplexities
by
say
ten
life
is
really
a
burden
i
suppose
she
added
after
a
pause
you
could
help
hearing
our
discussions
at
dinner
the
other
night
and
i
have
wondered
a
little
what
you
must
have
thought
yes
he
said
i
did
hear
it
is
it
the
regular
thing
if
i
may
ask
oh
yes
she
replied
with
a
tone
of
sadness
it
has
grown
to
be
it
must
be
very
trying
at
times
john
remarked
it
is
indeed
she
said
and
would
often
be
unendurable
to
me
if
it
were
not
for
my
sense
of
humor
as
it
would
be
to
my
sister
if
it
were
not
for
her
love
for
julius
is
really
a
very
lovable
man
and
i
too
am
very
fond
of
him
but
i
must
laugh
sometimes
though
my
better
nature
should
rather
i
suppose
impel
me
to
sighs
little
laughter
is
much
more
worth
he
quoted
chapter
iv
they
were
leaning
upon
the
rail
at
the
stern
of
the
ship
which
was
going
with
what
little
wind
there
was
and
a
following
sea
with
which
as
it
plunged
down
the
long
slopes
of
the
waves
the
vessel
seemed
to
be
running
a
victorious
race
the
sea
was
a
deep
sapphire
and
in
the
wake
the
sunlight
turned
the
broken
water
to
vivid
emerald
the
air
was
of
a
caressing
softness
and
altogether
it
was
a
day
and
scene
of
indescribable
beauty
and
inspiration
for
a
while
there
was
silence
between
them
which
john
broke
at
last
i
suppose
he
said
that
one
would
best
show
his
appreciation
of
all
this
by
refraining
from
the
comment
which
must
needs
be
comparatively
commonplace
but
really
this
is
so
superb
that
i
must
express
some
of
my
emotion
even
at
the
risk
of
lowering
your
opinion
of
my
good
taste
provided
of
course
that
you
have
one
well
she
said
laughing
it
may
relieve
your
mind
if
you
care
to
know
that
had
you
kept
silent
an
instant
longer
i
should
have
taken
the
risk
of
lowering
your
opinion
of
my
good
taste
provided
of
course
that
you
have
one
by
remarking
that
this
was
perfectly
magnificent
i
should
think
that
this
would
be
the
sort
of
day
to
get
carling
on
deck
this
air
and
sun
would
brace
him
up
said
john
she
turned
to
him
with
a
laugh
and
said
that
is
the
general
opinion
or
was
two
hours
ago
but
i
afraid
it
out
of
the
question
now
unless
we
can
manage
it
after
luncheon
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
with
a
puzzled
smile
at
the
mixture
of
annoyance
and
amusement
visible
in
her
face
same
old
story
yes
she
replied
same
old
story
when
i
went
to
my
breakfast
i
called
at
my
sister
room
and
said
come
boys
and
girls
come
out
to
play
the
sun
doth
shine
as
bright
as
day
and
when
i
had
my
breakfast
i
coming
to
lug
you
both
on
deck
it
a
perfectly
glorious
morning
and
it
will
do
you
both
no
end
of
good
after
being
shut
up
so
long
right
my
sister
answered
has
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
go
up
as
soon
as
he
is
dressed
you
call
for
us
in
half
an
hour
and
we
will
be
ready
and
would
he
come
john
asked
and
why
not
oh
she
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
and
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
shoes
shoes
said
john
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
was
the
rejoinder
when
i
went
back
to
the
room
i
found
my
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
lounge
or
what
you
call
it
all
dressed
but
his
coat
rubbing
his
chin
between
his
finger
and
thumb
and
gazing
with
despairing
perplexity
at
his
feet
it
seems
that
my
sister
had
got
past
all
the
other
dilemmas
but
in
a
moment
of
inadvertence
had
left
the
shoe
question
to
him
with
the
result
that
he
had
put
on
one
russet
shoe
and
one
black
one
and
had
laced
them
up
before
discovering
the
discrepancy
i
do
see
anything
very
difficult
in
that
situation
remarked
john
do
you
she
said
scornfully
no
i
suppose
not
but
it
was
quite
enough
for
julius
and
more
than
enough
for
my
sister
and
me
his
first
notion
was
to
take
off
shoes
and
begin
all
over
again
and
perhaps
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
carry
it
out
he
would
have
been
all
right
but
alice
was
silly
enough
to
suggest
the
obvious
thing
to
him
to
take
off
one
and
put
on
the
mate
to
the
other
and
then
the
trouble
began
first
he
was
in
favor
of
the
black
shoes
as
being
thicker
in
the
sole
and
then
he
reflected
that
they
had
been
blackened
since
coming
on
board
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
russets
were
more
appropriate
anyway
but
the
blacks
were
easier
to
lace
had
i
noticed
whether
the
men
on
board
were
wearing
russet
or
black
as
a
rule
and
did
alice
remember
whether
it
was
one
of
the
russets
or
one
of
the
blacks
that
he
was
saying
the
other
day
pinched
his
toe
he
did
quite
like
the
looks
of
a
russet
shoe
with
dark
trousers
and
called
us
to
witness
that
those
he
had
on
were
dark
but
he
thought
he
remembered
that
it
was
the
black
shoe
which
pinched
him
he
supposed
he
could
change
his
trousers
and
so
on
and
so
on
sticking
out
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
lifting
them
alternately
to
his
knee
for
scrutiny
appealing
now
to
alice
and
now
to
me
and
getting
more
hopelessly
bewildered
all
the
time
it
went
on
that
way
for
it
seemed
to
me
at
least
half
an
hour
and
at
last
i
said
come
now
julius
take
off
the
brown
shoe
it
too
thin
and
does
go
with
your
dark
trousers
and
pinches
your
toe
and
none
of
the
men
are
wearing
them
and
just
put
on
the
other
black
one
and
come
along
we
all
suffocating
for
some
fresh
air
and
if
you
do
get
started
pretty
soon
we
get
on
deck
on
deck
he
said
looking
up
at
me
with
a
puzzled
expression
and
holding
fast
to
the
brown
shoe
on
his
knee
with
both
hands
as
if
he
were
afraid
i
would
take
it
away
from
him
by
main
strength
on
deck
why
why
i
believe
i
better
not
go
out
this
morning
do
you
and
then
said
john
after
a
pause
oh
she
replied
i
looked
at
alice
and
she
shook
her
head
as
much
to
say
no
use
for
the
present
and
i
fled
the
place
m
muttered
john
he
must
have
been
a
nice
traveling
companion
has
it
been
like
that
all
the
time
most
of
it
she
said
but
not
quite
all
and
this
morning
was
rather
an
exaggeration
of
the
regular
thing
but
getting
started
on
a
journey
was
usually
pretty
awful
once
we
quite
missed
our
train
because
he
could
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
put
on
a
light
overcoat
or
a
heavy
one
i
finally
settled
the
question
for
him
but
we
were
just
too
late
you
must
be
a
very
amiable
person
remarked
john
indeed
i
am
not
she
declared
but
julius
is
and
it
almost
impossible
to
be
really
put
out
with
him
particularly
in
his
condition
i
have
come
to
believe
that
he
can
not
help
it
and
he
submits
to
my
bullying
with
such
sweetness
that
even
my
impatience
gives
way
have
you
three
people
been
alone
together
all
the
time
john
asked
yes
she
replied
except
for
four
or
five
weeks
we
visited
some
american
friends
in
berlin
the
nollises
for
a
fortnight
and
after
our
visit
to
them
they
traveled
with
us
for
three
weeks
through
south
germany
and
switzerland
we
parted
with
them
at
metz
only
about
three
weeks
since
how
did
carling
seem
while
you
were
all
together
asked
john
looking
keenly
at
her
oh
she
replied
he
was
more
like
himself
than
i
have
seen
him
for
a
long
time
since
he
began
to
break
down
in
fact
he
turned
his
eyes
from
her
face
as
she
looked
up
at
him
and
as
he
did
not
speak
she
said
suggestively
you
are
thinking
something
you
quite
like
to
say
but
i
think
i
know
pretty
nearly
what
it
is
yes
said
john
with
a
query
you
think
he
has
had
too
much
feminine
companionship
or
had
it
too
exclusively
is
that
it
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
say
so
well
said
john
if
you
put
it
exclusively
i
will
admit
that
there
was
something
of
the
sort
in
my
mind
and
he
added
if
you
will
let
me
say
so
it
must
at
times
have
been
rather
hard
for
him
to
be
interested
or
amused
that
it
must
have
that
is
to
say
oh
it
she
exclaimed
it
must
have
been
very
for
him
is
that
it
said
john
with
a
grimace
can
not
tell
a
lie
oh
she
said
laughing
your
hatchet
is
very
sharp
i
forgive
you
but
really
she
added
i
know
it
has
been
you
will
laugh
when
i
tell
you
the
one
particular
resource
we
fell
back
upon
bid
me
to
laugh
and
i
will
laugh
said
john
euchre
she
said
looking
at
him
defiantly
euchre
we
have
played
as
nearly
as
i
can
estimate
fifteen
hundred
games
in
which
he
has
held
both
bowers
and
the
ace
of
trumps
or
something
equally
victorious
i
should
say
fourteen
hundred
times
oh
she
cried
with
an
expression
of
loathing
may
i
never
never
never
see
a
card
again
as
long
as
i
live
john
laughed
without
restraint
and
after
a
petulant
little
she
joined
him
may
i
light
up
my
pipe
he
said
i
will
get
to
leeward
i
shall
not
mind
in
the
least
she
assented
by
the
way
he
asked
does
carling
smoke
he
used
to
she
replied
and
while
we
were
with
the
nollises
he
smoked
every
day
but
after
we
left
them
he
fell
back
into
the
notion
that
it
was
bad
for
him
john
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
in
silence
and
after
a
satisfactory
puff
or
two
said
will
carling
go
in
to
dinner
yes
she
replied
i
think
he
will
if
it
is
no
rougher
than
at
present
it
will
probably
be
smoother
said
john
you
must
introduce
me
to
him
oh
she
interrupted
of
course
but
it
will
hardly
be
necessary
as
alice
and
i
have
spoken
so
often
to
him
of
you
i
was
going
to
say
john
resumed
that
he
may
possibly
let
me
take
him
off
your
hands
a
little
and
after
dinner
will
be
the
best
time
i
think
if
i
can
get
him
into
the
smoking
room
that
a
cigar
and
and
something
hot
with
a
bit
of
lemon
peel
and
so
forth
later
on
may
induce
him
to
visit
with
me
for
a
while
and
pass
the
evening
or
part
of
it
you
want
to
be
an
angel
she
exclaimed
oh
i
we
shall
be
so
obliged
i
know
it
just
what
he
wants
some
to
take
him
in
hand
i
in
no
hurry
to
be
an
angel
said
john
laughing
and
with
a
bow
it
better
sometimes
to
be
the
rose
than
to
the
rose
and
you
are
proposing
to
overpay
me
quite
i
shall
enjoy
doing
what
i
proposed
if
it
be
possible
their
talk
then
drifted
off
into
various
channels
as
topics
suggested
themselves
until
the
ship
bell
sounded
the
luncheon
hour
miss
blake
went
to
join
her
sister
and
but
john
had
some
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
in
the
smoking
room
it
appeared
that
the
ladies
had
better
success
than
in
the
morning
for
he
saw
them
later
on
in
their
steamer
chairs
with
carling
who
was
huddled
in
many
wraps
with
the
flaps
of
his
cap
down
over
his
ears
all
the
chairs
were
full
his
own
included
as
happens
to
men
and
he
had
only
a
brief
colloquy
with
the
party
he
noticed
however
that
carling
had
on
the
russet
shoes
and
wondered
if
they
pinched
him
in
fact
though
he
could
have
said
exactly
why
he
rather
hoped
that
they
did
he
had
just
that
sympathy
for
the
nerves
of
which
is
to
be
expected
from
those
of
that
is
very
little
when
he
went
in
to
dinner
the
carlings
and
miss
blake
had
been
at
table
some
minutes
there
had
been
the
usual
controversy
about
what
carling
would
drink
with
his
dinner
and
he
had
decided
upon
apollinaris
water
but
miss
blake
with
an
idea
of
her
own
had
given
an
order
for
champagne
and
was
exhibiting
some
consternation
real
or
assumed
at
the
fact
of
having
a
whole
bottle
brought
in
with
the
cork
extracted
a
customary
trick
at
sea
i
hope
you
will
help
me
out
she
said
to
john
as
he
bowed
and
seated
himself
one
has
blundered
and
here
is
a
whole
bottle
of
champagne
which
must
be
drunk
to
save
it
are
you
prepared
to
help
turn
my
or
somebody
blunder
into
hospitality
i
am
prepared
to
make
any
sacrifice
said
john
laughing
in
the
sacred
cause
no
less
than
i
expected
of
you
she
said
oblige
please
fill
your
glass
thanks
said
john
permit
me
and
he
filled
her
own
as
well
as
the
meal
proceeded
there
was
some
desultory
talk
about
the
weather
the
ship
run
and
so
on
but
carling
was
almost
silent
and
her
husband
said
but
little
more
even
miss
blake
seemed
to
have
something
on
her
mind
and
contributed
but
little
to
the
conversation
presently
carling
said
mary
do
you
think
a
mouthful
of
wine
would
hurt
me
certainly
not
was
the
reply
it
will
do
you
good
reaching
over
for
his
glass
and
pouring
the
wine
that
enough
that
enough
he
protested
as
the
foam
came
up
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
she
proceeded
to
fill
it
up
to
the
brim
and
put
it
beside
him
and
later
as
she
had
opportunity
kept
it
replenished
as
the
dinner
concluded
john
said
to
carling
wo
you
go
up
to
the
smoking
room
with
me
for
coffee
i
like
a
bit
of
tobacco
with
mine
and
i
have
some
really
good
cigars
and
some
cigarettes
if
you
prefer
them
that
i
can
vouch
for
as
usual
when
the
unexpected
was
presented
to
his
mind
carling
passed
the
perplexity
on
to
his
at
this
time
however
his
dinner
and
the
two
glasses
of
wine
which
miss
blake
had
contrived
that
he
should
swallow
had
braced
him
up
and
john
suggestion
was
so
warmly
seconded
by
the
ladies
that
after
some
feeble
protests
and
misgivings
he
yielded
and
john
carried
him
off
i
hope
it
wo
upset
julius
said
carling
doubtfully
it
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
her
sister
replied
he
will
get
through
the
evening
without
worrying
himself
and
you
into
fits
and
if
lenox
succeeds
you
wo
see
anything
of
him
till
ten
or
after
and
not
then
i
hope
mind
you
to
be
sound
asleep
when
he
comes
in
snore
a
little
if
necessary
and
let
him
get
to
bed
without
any
talk
at
all
why
do
you
say
lenox
succeeds
asked
carling
it
was
his
suggestion
miss
blake
answered
we
had
been
talking
about
julius
and
he
finally
told
me
he
thought
he
would
be
the
better
of
an
occasional
interval
of
masculine
society
and
i
quite
agreed
with
him
you
know
how
much
he
enjoyed
being
with
george
nollis
and
how
much
like
himself
he
appeared
that
is
true
said
carling
and
you
know
that
just
as
soon
as
he
got
alone
again
with
us
two
women
he
began
backing
and
filling
as
badly
as
ever
i
believe
lenox
is
right
and
that
julius
is
just
petticoated
to
death
between
us
did
lenox
say
that
asked
carling
incredulously
no
said
her
sister
laughing
he
did
make
use
of
precisely
that
figure
but
that
was
what
he
thought
plainly
enough
what
do
you
think
of
mr
lenox
said
carling
irrelevantly
do
you
like
him
i
thought
that
he
looked
at
you
very
admiringly
once
or
twice
she
added
with
her
eyes
on
her
sister
face
well
said
mary
with
a
petulant
toss
of
the
head
except
that
had
about
an
hour
talk
with
him
and
that
i
knew
him
when
we
were
children
at
least
when
i
was
a
child
he
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
and
i
do
wish
she
added
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
that
you
would
give
up
that
fad
of
yours
that
every
man
who
comes
along
is
going
to
to
be
a
nuisance
he
seems
very
pleasant
said
carling
meekly
ignoring
her
sister
reproach
oh
yes
she
replied
indifferently
he
pleasant
enough
let
us
go
up
and
have
a
walk
on
deck
i
want
you
to
be
sound
asleep
when
julius
comes
in
chapter
john
found
his
humane
experiment
pleasanter
than
he
expected
carling
as
was
to
be
anticipated
demurred
a
little
at
the
coffee
and
still
more
at
the
cigarette
but
having
his
appetite
for
tobacco
aroused
and
finding
that
no
alarming
symptoms
ensued
he
followed
it
with
a
cigar
and
later
on
was
induced
to
go
the
length
of
scotch
and
soda
under
the
pleasant
effect
of
which
and
john
sympathetic
efforts
he
was
for
the
time
transformed
the
younger
man
being
surprised
to
find
him
a
man
of
interesting
experience
considerable
reading
and
what
was
most
surprising
a
jolly
sense
of
humor
and
a
fund
of
anecdotes
which
he
related
extremely
well
the
evening
was
a
decided
success
perhaps
the
best
evidence
of
it
coming
at
the
last
when
at
john
suggestion
that
they
supplement
their
modest
potations
with
a
carling
cheerfully
assented
upon
the
condition
that
they
should
have
it
with
him
and
as
he
went
along
the
deck
after
saying
good
night
john
was
positive
that
he
heard
a
whistled
tune
the
next
day
was
equally
fine
but
during
the
night
the
ship
had
run
into
the
swell
of
a
storm
and
in
the
morning
there
was
more
motion
than
the
weaker
ones
could
relish
the
sea
grew
quieter
as
the
day
advanced
john
was
early
and
finished
his
breakfast
before
miss
blake
came
in
he
found
her
on
deck
about
ten
she
gave
him
her
hand
as
they
said
good
morning
and
he
turned
and
walked
by
her
side
how
is
your
this
morning
he
inquired
oh
she
said
laughing
he
in
a
mixture
of
feeling
very
well
and
feeling
that
he
ought
not
to
feel
so
but
as
they
are
coming
up
pretty
soon
it
would
appear
that
the
misgivings
are
not
overwhelming
he
came
in
last
night
and
retired
without
saying
a
word
my
sister
pretended
to
be
asleep
she
says
he
went
to
sleep
at
once
and
that
she
was
awake
at
intervals
and
knows
that
he
slept
like
a
top
he
wo
make
any
very
sweeping
admissions
however
but
has
gone
so
far
as
to
concede
that
he
had
a
very
pleasant
evening
which
is
going
a
long
way
for
him
and
to
say
that
you
are
a
very
agreeable
young
man
there
i
did
intend
to
tell
you
that
but
you
have
been
so
good
that
perhaps
so
much
as
a
compliment
is
no
more
than
your
due
thank
you
very
much
said
john
carling
is
evidently
a
very
discriminating
person
really
it
was
good
of
me
at
all
i
was
quite
the
gainer
for
he
entertained
me
more
than
i
did
him
we
had
a
very
pleasant
evening
and
i
hope
we
shall
have
more
of
them
i
do
indeed
i
got
an
entirely
different
impression
of
him
he
added
yes
she
said
i
can
imagine
that
you
did
he
can
be
very
agreeable
and
he
is
really
a
man
of
a
great
deal
of
character
when
he
is
himself
he
has
been
goodness
itself
to
me
and
has
managed
my
affairs
for
years
even
his
judgment
in
business
matters
is
wonderfully
sound
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
she
continued
i
do
know
but
i
should
have
been
a
pauper
my
father
left
a
large
estate
but
he
died
very
suddenly
and
his
affairs
were
very
much
spread
out
and
involved
and
had
to
be
carried
along
julius
put
himself
into
the
breach
and
not
only
saved
our
fortunes
but
has
considerably
increased
them
of
course
alice
is
his
wife
but
i
feel
very
grateful
to
him
on
my
own
account
i
did
not
altogether
appreciate
it
at
the
time
but
now
i
shudder
to
think
that
i
might
have
had
either
to
for
myself
or
be
dependent
i
do
think
that
dependence
would
have
suited
your
book
was
comment
as
he
took
in
the
lines
of
her
face
no
she
replied
and
i
thank
heaven
that
i
have
not
had
to
endure
it
i
am
not
she
added
so
impressed
with
what
money
procures
for
people
as
what
it
saves
them
from
yes
said
john
i
think
your
distinction
is
just
to
possess
it
is
to
be
free
from
some
of
the
most
disagreeable
apprehensions
certainly
but
i
confess
whether
to
my
credit
or
my
shame
i
do
know
i
have
never
thought
much
about
it
i
certainly
am
not
rich
positively
and
i
the
faintest
notion
whether
i
may
or
not
be
prospectively
i
have
always
had
as
much
as
i
really
needed
and
perhaps
more
but
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
future
they
were
leaning
over
the
rail
on
the
port
side
i
should
think
she
said
after
a
moment
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
that
it
was
if
you
will
not
think
me
presuming
a
matter
about
which
you
might
have
some
justifiable
curiosity
oh
not
at
all
he
assured
her
stepping
to
leeward
and
producing
a
cigar
i
have
had
some
stirrings
of
late
and
please
do
think
me
an
incorrigible
idler
i
spent
nearly
two
years
in
a
office
and
earned
well
say
half
my
salary
in
fact
my
business
instincts
were
so
strong
that
i
left
college
after
my
second
year
for
that
purpose
but
seeing
no
special
chance
of
advancement
in
the
race
for
wealth
and
as
my
father
seemed
rather
to
welcome
the
idea
i
broke
off
and
went
over
to
germany
i
have
been
quite
idle
though
i
should
be
puzzled
i
admit
to
find
a
market
for
what
i
have
to
offer
to
the
world
would
you
be
interested
in
a
schedule
of
my
accomplishments
oh
she
said
i
should
be
charmed
but
as
i
am
every
moment
expecting
the
advent
of
my
family
and
as
i
am
relied
upon
to
locate
them
and
tuck
them
up
i
afraid
i
shall
not
have
time
to
hear
it
no
he
said
laughing
it
quite
too
long
she
was
silent
for
some
moments
gazing
down
into
the
water
apparently
debating
something
in
her
mind
and
quite
unconscious
of
scrutiny
finally
she
turned
to
him
with
a
little
laugh
you
might
begin
on
your
list
and
if
i
am
called
away
you
can
finish
it
at
another
time
i
hope
you
did
think
i
was
speaking
in
earnest
he
said
no
she
replied
i
did
not
think
you
really
intended
to
unpack
your
wares
but
speaking
seriously
and
at
the
risk
i
fear
that
you
may
think
me
rather
if
i
may
be
allowed
that
expression
i
know
a
good
many
men
in
america
and
i
think
that
without
an
exception
they
are
professional
men
or
business
men
or
being
neither
and
i
know
but
few
such
have
a
competence
or
more
and
i
was
wondering
just
now
after
what
you
told
me
what
a
man
like
you
would
or
could
do
if
he
were
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
i
afraid
that
is
rather
frank
for
the
acquaintance
of
a
day
is
it
she
asked
with
a
slight
flush
but
it
really
is
not
so
personal
as
it
may
sound
to
you
my
dear
miss
blake
he
replied
our
acquaintance
goes
back
at
least
ten
years
please
let
that
fact
count
for
something
in
your
mind
the
truth
is
i
have
done
some
wondering
along
that
same
line
myself
without
coming
to
any
satisfactory
conclusion
i
devoutly
hope
i
may
not
be
so
thrown
absolutely
for
the
truth
is
i
have
a
marketable
commodity
little
latin
and
less
greek
german
and
french
enough
to
read
and
understand
and
talk
on
the
surface
of
things
and
what
mathematics
history
et
cetera
i
have
not
forgotten
i
know
the
piano
well
enough
to
read
and
play
an
accompaniment
after
a
fashion
and
i
have
had
some
good
teaching
for
the
voice
and
some
experience
in
singing
at
home
and
abroad
in
fact
i
come
nearer
to
a
market
there
i
think
than
in
any
other
direction
perhaps
i
have
given
some
time
to
fencing
in
various
schools
and
before
i
left
home
billy
williams
would
sometimes
speak
encouragingly
of
my
progress
with
the
gloves
there
that
is
my
list
and
not
a
dollar
in
it
from
beginning
to
end
i
afraid
who
is
billy
williams
she
asked
billy
said
john
is
the
very
and
gentlemanlike
at
the
altman
house
an
and
about
the
most
accomplished
member
of
his
profession
of
his
day
and
weight
who
is
employed
to
keep
order
and
if
necessary
to
thrust
out
the
riotous
who
would
disturb
the
contemplations
of
the
lovers
of
art
that
frequent
the
bar
of
that
hotel
it
was
to
be
seen
that
miss
blake
was
not
particularly
impressed
by
this
description
of
billy
and
his
functions
upon
which
she
made
no
comment
you
have
not
included
in
your
list
she
remarked
what
you
acquired
in
the
office
you
told
me
of
no
upon
my
word
i
had
forgotten
that
and
it
about
the
only
thing
of
use
in
the
whole
category
he
answered
if
i
were
put
to
it
and
could
find
a
place
i
think
i
might
earn
fifty
dollars
a
month
as
a
clerk
or
messenger
or
something
hullo
here
are
your
people
he
went
forward
with
his
companion
and
greeted
carling
and
her
husband
who
returned
his
good
morning
with
a
feeble
smile
and
submitted
to
his
ministrations
in
the
matter
of
chair
and
rugs
with
an
air
of
unresisting
invalidism
which
was
almost
too
obvious
he
thought
but
after
luncheon
john
managed
to
induce
him
to
walk
for
a
while
to
smoke
a
cigarette
and
finally
to
brave
the
perils
of
a
sherry
and
bitters
before
dinner
the
ladies
had
the
afternoon
to
themselves
john
had
no
chance
of
a
further
visit
with
mary
during
the
day
a
loss
only
partially
made
good
to
him
by
a
very
approving
smile
and
a
remark
which
she
made
to
him
at
dinner
that
he
must
be
a
lineal
descendant
of
the
samaritan
carling
submitted
himself
to
him
for
the
evening
indeed
it
came
about
that
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
he
had
rather
more
of
the
company
of
that
gentleman
who
fairly
attached
himself
to
him
than
under
all
the
circumstances
he
cared
for
but
the
gratitude
of
the
ladies
was
so
cordial
that
he
felt
paid
for
some
sacrifices
of
his
inclinations
and
there
was
an
hour
or
so
every
morning
for
the
fine
weather
lasted
through
which
he
spent
with
mary
blake
with
increasing
interest
and
pleasure
and
he
found
himself
inwardly
rejoicing
over
a
mishap
to
the
engine
which
though
of
no
very
great
magnitude
would
retard
the
passage
by
a
couple
of
days
there
can
hardly
be
any
conditions
more
favorable
to
the
forming
of
acquaintanceships
friendships
and
even
more
tender
relations
than
are
afforded
by
the
life
on
board
ship
there
is
opportunity
propinquity
and
the
community
of
interest
which
breaks
down
the
barriers
of
ordinary
reserve
these
relations
to
be
sure
are
not
always
of
the
most
lasting
character
and
not
infrequently
are
practically
ended
before
the
parties
thereto
are
out
of
the
officer
hands
and
fade
into
nameless
oblivion
unless
one
happens
to
run
across
the
passenger
list
among
one
souvenirs
but
there
are
exceptions
if
at
this
time
the
question
had
been
asked
our
friend
even
by
himself
whether
to
put
it
plainly
he
were
in
love
with
mary
blake
he
would
no
doubt
have
strenuously
denied
it
but
it
is
certain
that
if
any
one
had
said
or
intimated
that
any
feature
or
characteristic
of
hers
was
faulty
or
susceptible
of
any
change
for
the
better
he
would
have
secretly
disliked
that
person
and
entertained
the
meanest
opinion
of
that
person
mental
and
moral
attributes
he
would
have
liked
the
voyage
prolonged
indefinitely
or
at
any
rate
as
long
as
the
provisions
held
out
it
has
been
remarked
by
some
one
that
all
mundane
things
come
to
an
end
sooner
or
later
and
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
it
bears
out
that
statement
the
engines
were
successfully
repaired
and
the
ship
eventually
came
to
anchor
outside
the
harbor
about
eleven
on
the
night
of
the
last
day
mary
and
john
were
standing
together
at
the
forward
rail
there
had
been
but
little
talk
between
them
and
only
of
a
desultory
and
impersonal
character
as
the
anchor
chains
rattled
in
the
john
said
well
that
ends
it
what
ends
what
she
asked
the
voyage
and
the
holiday
and
the
episode
and
lots
of
things
he
replied
we
have
come
to
anchor
yes
she
said
the
voyage
is
over
that
is
true
but
for
my
part
if
the
last
six
months
can
be
called
a
holiday
its
end
is
welcome
and
i
should
think
you
might
be
glad
that
your
holiday
is
over
too
but
i
do
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
episode
and
lots
of
things
there
was
an
undertone
in
her
utterance
which
her
companion
did
not
quite
comprehend
though
it
was
obvious
to
him
the
episode
of
of
our
friendship
if
i
may
call
it
so
he
replied
i
call
it
so
she
said
decisively
you
have
certainly
been
a
friend
to
of
us
this
episode
is
over
to
be
sure
but
is
there
any
more
than
that
somebody
says
that
is
largely
a
matter
of
streets
said
john
gloomily
you
will
go
your
way
and
i
shall
go
mine
yes
she
replied
rather
sharply
that
is
true
enough
but
if
that
cynical
quotation
of
yours
has
anything
in
it
it
equally
true
it
that
friendship
is
a
matter
of
cabs
and
street
cars
and
the
elevated
road
of
course
we
can
hardly
be
expected
to
look
you
up
but
street
is
exactly
in
california
and
the
whole
question
lies
with
yourself
i
do
know
if
you
care
to
be
told
so
but
julius
and
my
sister
like
you
very
much
and
will
welcome
you
heartily
always
thanks
very
much
said
john
staring
straight
out
in
front
of
him
and
forming
a
determination
that
street
would
see
but
precious
little
of
she
gave
a
side
glance
at
him
as
he
did
not
speak
further
there
was
light
enough
to
see
the
expression
of
his
mouth
and
she
read
his
thought
almost
in
words
she
had
thought
that
she
had
detected
a
suggestion
of
sentimentality
on
his
part
which
she
intended
to
keep
strictly
in
abeyance
but
in
her
intention
not
to
seem
to
respond
to
it
she
had
taken
an
attitude
of
coolness
and
a
tone
which
was
almost
sarcastic
and
now
perceived
that
so
far
as
results
were
apparent
she
had
carried
matters
somewhat
further
than
she
intended
her
heart
smote
her
a
little
too
to
think
that
he
was
hurt
she
really
liked
him
very
much
and
contritely
recalled
how
kind
and
thoughtful
and
unselfish
he
had
been
and
how
helpful
and
she
knew
that
it
had
been
almost
wholly
for
her
yes
she
was
willing
and
glad
to
think
so
but
while
she
wished
that
she
had
taken
a
different
line
at
the
outset
she
hated
desperately
to
make
any
concession
and
the
seconds
of
their
silence
grew
into
minutes
she
stole
another
glance
at
his
face
it
was
plain
that
negotiations
for
harmony
would
have
to
begin
with
her
finally
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
very
much
is
an
entirely
polite
expression
but
it
very
responsive
i
thought
it
met
your
cordiality
quite
half
way
was
the
rejoinder
of
course
i
am
glad
to
be
assured
of
and
carling
regard
and
that
they
would
be
glad
to
see
me
but
i
think
i
might
have
been
justified
in
hoping
that
you
would
go
a
little
further
do
you
think
he
looked
at
her
as
he
asked
the
question
but
she
did
not
turn
her
head
presently
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
slowly
as
if
weighing
her
words
will
it
be
enough
if
i
say
that
i
shall
be
very
sorry
if
you
do
not
come
he
put
his
left
hand
upon
her
right
which
was
resting
on
the
rail
and
for
two
seconds
she
let
it
stay
yes
he
said
thanks
very
much
i
must
go
now
she
said
turning
toward
him
and
for
a
moment
she
looked
searchingly
in
his
face
good
night
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
and
john
looked
after
her
as
she
walked
down
the
deck
and
he
knew
how
it
was
with
him
chapter
vi
john
saw
miss
blake
the
next
morning
in
the
saloon
among
the
passengers
in
line
for
the
customs
official
it
was
an
easy
conjecture
that
carling
nerves
were
not
up
to
committing
himself
to
a
declaration
of
any
sort
and
that
miss
blake
was
undertaking
the
duty
for
the
party
he
did
not
see
her
again
until
he
had
had
his
luggage
passed
and
turned
it
over
to
an
expressman
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
leave
the
wharf
he
came
across
the
group
and
stopped
to
greet
them
and
ask
if
he
could
be
of
service
and
was
told
that
their
houseman
had
everything
in
charge
and
that
they
were
just
going
to
their
carriage
which
was
waiting
and
said
miss
blake
if
you
are
going
up
town
we
can
offer
you
a
seat
i
discommode
you
he
asked
if
you
are
sure
i
shall
not
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
taken
as
far
as
madison
avenue
and
street
for
i
suppose
that
will
be
your
route
quite
sure
she
replied
seconded
by
the
carlings
and
so
it
happened
that
john
went
directly
home
instead
of
going
first
to
his
office
the
weather
was
a
chilly
drizzle
and
he
was
glad
to
be
spared
the
discomfort
of
going
about
in
it
with
overcoat
and
umbrella
and
felt
a
certain
justification
in
concluding
that
after
two
years
a
few
hours
more
or
less
under
the
circumstances
would
make
but
little
difference
and
then
too
the
prospect
of
half
or
of
an
hour
in
miss
blake
company
the
carlings
notwithstanding
was
a
temptation
to
be
welcomed
but
if
he
had
hoped
or
expected
as
perhaps
would
have
been
not
unnatural
to
discover
in
that
young
woman
air
any
hint
or
trace
of
the
feeling
she
had
exhibited
or
perhaps
it
should
be
said
to
a
degree
permitted
to
show
itself
disappointment
was
his
portion
her
manner
was
as
much
in
contrast
with
that
of
the
last
days
of
their
voyage
together
as
the
handsome
street
dress
and
hat
in
which
she
was
attired
bore
to
the
dress
and
headgear
of
her
steamer
costume
and
it
almost
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
contrasts
bore
some
relation
to
each
other
after
the
question
of
the
carriage
windows
whether
they
should
be
up
or
down
either
or
both
and
how
much
had
been
settled
and
as
usual
in
such
dilemmas
by
miss
blake
the
drive
up
town
was
comparatively
a
silent
one
john
mind
was
occupied
with
sundry
reflections
and
speculations
of
many
of
which
his
companion
was
the
subject
and
to
some
extent
in
noting
the
changes
in
the
streets
and
buildings
which
an
absence
of
two
years
made
noticeable
to
him
mary
looked
steadily
out
of
window
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
save
for
an
occasional
brief
response
to
some
casual
comment
or
remark
of
john
carling
had
muffled
himself
past
all
talking
and
his
wife
preserved
the
silence
which
was
characteristic
of
her
when
unurged
john
was
set
down
at
street
and
as
he
made
his
adieus
carling
said
do
come
and
see
us
as
soon
as
you
can
lenox
but
miss
blake
simply
said
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
for
an
instant
and
he
went
on
to
his
father
house
he
let
himself
in
with
the
which
he
had
carried
through
all
his
absence
but
was
at
once
encountered
by
jeffrey
who
with
his
wife
had
for
years
constituted
the
domestic
staff
of
the
lenox
household
well
jeff
said
john
as
he
shook
hands
heartily
with
the
old
servant
how
are
you
and
how
is
ann
you
do
look
a
day
older
and
the
climate
seems
to
agree
with
you
eh
you
welcome
home
john
replied
jeffrey
and
thank
you
sir
me
and
ann
is
very
well
sir
it
a
pleasure
to
see
you
again
and
home
it
is
indeed
thank
you
jeff
said
john
it
rather
nice
to
be
back
is
my
room
ready
yes
sir
said
jeffrey
i
think
it
all
right
though
we
thought
that
maybe
it
be
later
in
the
day
when
you
got
here
sir
we
thought
maybe
you
go
to
lenox
office
first
i
did
intend
to
said
john
mounting
the
stairs
followed
by
jeffrey
with
his
bag
but
i
had
a
chance
to
drive
up
with
some
friends
and
the
day
is
so
beastly
that
i
took
advantage
of
it
how
is
my
father
he
asked
after
entering
the
chamber
which
struck
him
as
being
so
strangely
familiar
and
so
familiarly
strange
well
sir
said
jeffrey
he
much
about
the
same
most
ways
and
then
again
he
different
too
seeing
him
every
day
perhaps
i
notice
so
much
but
if
i
was
to
say
that
he
kind
of
quieter
perhaps
that
be
what
i
mean
sir
well
said
john
smiling
my
father
was
about
the
quietest
person
i
ever
knew
and
if
he
grown
more
so
what
do
you
mean
well
sir
replied
the
man
i
notice
at
table
sir
for
one
thing
we
been
alone
here
off
and
on
a
good
bit
sir
and
he
used
always
to
have
a
pleasant
word
or
two
to
say
to
me
and
may
be
to
ask
me
questions
and
that
sir
but
for
a
long
time
lately
he
hardly
seems
to
notice
me
of
course
there
ai
any
need
of
his
saying
anything
because
i
know
all
he
wants
seeing
i
waited
on
him
so
long
but
it
different
in
a
way
sir
does
he
go
out
in
the
evening
to
his
club
asked
john
very
rarely
sir
said
jeffrey
he
mostly
goes
to
his
room
after
dinner
an
oftentimes
i
hear
him
walking
up
an
down
up
an
down
and
sir
he
added
you
know
he
often
used
to
have
some
of
his
friends
to
dine
with
him
and
that
ai
happened
in
i
should
guess
for
a
year
have
things
gone
wrong
with
him
in
any
way
said
john
a
sudden
anxiety
overcoming
some
reluctance
to
question
a
servant
on
such
a
subject
you
mean
about
business
and
such
like
replied
jeffrey
no
sir
not
so
far
as
i
know
you
know
john
sir
that
i
pay
all
the
house
accounts
and
there
has
never
been
no
no
shortness
as
i
might
say
but
we
living
a
bit
simpler
than
we
used
to
in
the
matter
of
wine
and
such
like
and
as
i
told
you
we
do
have
no
more
is
that
all
asked
john
with
some
relief
well
sir
was
the
reply
perhaps
it
because
lenox
is
getting
older
and
do
care
so
much
about
such
things
but
i
have
noticed
that
he
has
had
anything
new
from
the
tailor
in
a
long
time
and
really
sir
though
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
it
his
things
is
getting
a
bit
shabby
sir
and
he
used
to
be
always
so
john
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
window
which
looked
out
at
the
rear
of
the
house
the
words
of
the
old
servant
disquieted
him
notwithstanding
that
there
was
nothing
so
far
that
could
not
be
accounted
for
without
alarm
jeffrey
waited
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
john
will
you
be
having
luncheon
here
sir
no
thank
you
jeff
said
john
nothing
more
now
and
i
will
lunch
here
i
come
down
and
see
ann
presently
thank
you
sir
said
jeffrey
and
withdrew
the
view
from
the
back
windows
of
most
city
houses
is
not
calculated
to
arouse
enthusiasm
at
the
best
of
times
and
the
day
was
singularly
dispiriting
a
sky
of
lead
and
a
drizzling
rain
which
emphasized
the
squalor
of
the
back
yards
in
view
it
was
all
very
depressing
talk
though
inconclusive
had
stirred
in
john
mind
an
uneasiness
which
was
near
to
apprehension
he
turned
and
walked
about
the
familiar
room
recognizing
the
furniture
his
mother
picture
over
the
mantel
the
bookshelves
filled
with
his
boyhood
accumulations
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
and
the
nothing
was
changed
it
was
all
as
he
had
left
it
two
years
ago
and
for
the
time
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
merely
dreamed
the
life
and
experiences
of
those
years
indeed
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
recalled
any
of
them
for
the
moment
and
then
suddenly
there
came
into
his
mind
the
thought
that
he
was
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
epoch
that
on
this
day
his
boyhood
ended
for
up
to
then
he
had
been
but
a
boy
the
thought
was
very
vivid
it
had
come
the
time
when
he
must
take
upon
himself
the
responsibilities
of
his
own
life
and
make
it
for
himself
the
time
which
he
had
looked
forward
to
as
to
come
some
day
but
not
hitherto
at
any
particular
moment
and
so
not
to
be
very
seriously
considered
it
has
been
said
that
life
had
always
been
made
easy
for
him
and
that
he
had
accepted
the
situation
without
protest
to
natures
the
thought
of
any
radical
change
in
the
current
of
affairs
is
usually
unwelcome
but
he
was
too
young
to
find
it
really
repugnant
and
then
too
as
he
walked
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
it
was
further
revealed
to
him
that
he
had
recently
found
a
motive
and
impulse
such
as
he
had
never
had
before
he
recalled
the
talk
that
he
had
had
with
the
companion
of
his
voyage
he
thought
of
her
as
one
who
could
be
tender
to
misfortune
and
charitable
to
incapacity
but
who
would
have
nothing
but
scorn
for
shiftlessness
and
malingering
and
he
realized
that
he
had
never
cared
for
anything
as
for
the
good
opinion
of
that
young
woman
no
there
should
be
for
him
no
more
sauntering
in
the
vales
and
groves
no
more
of
loitering
or
dallying
he
would
take
his
place
in
the
working
world
and
perhaps
some
day
a
thought
came
to
him
with
the
impact
of
a
blow
what
could
he
do
what
work
was
there
for
him
how
could
he
pull
his
weight
in
the
boat
all
his
life
he
had
depended
upon
some
one
else
with
thoughtlessness
hardly
had
it
ever
really
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
have
to
make
a
career
for
himself
of
business
he
had
thought
as
something
which
he
should
undertake
some
time
but
it
was
always
a
business
ready
made
to
his
hand
with
plenty
of
capital
not
of
his
own
acquiring
something
for
occupation
not
of
necessity
it
came
home
to
him
that
his
father
was
his
only
resource
and
that
of
his
affairs
he
knew
next
to
nothing
in
addition
to
his
affection
for
him
he
had
always
had
an
unquestioning
confidence
in
his
father
it
was
his
earliest
recollection
and
he
still
retained
it
to
almost
a
childish
extent
there
had
always
been
plenty
his
own
allowance
from
time
to
time
increased
though
never
extravagant
had
always
been
ample
and
on
the
one
occasion
when
he
had
grievously
exceeded
it
the
excess
had
been
paid
with
no
more
protest
than
a
gentle
i
think
you
ought
not
to
have
done
this
the
two
had
lived
together
when
john
was
at
home
without
ostentation
or
any
appearance
of
style
but
with
every
essential
of
luxury
the
house
and
its
furnishings
were
but
everything
was
of
the
best
and
when
three
or
four
of
the
elder
man
friends
would
come
to
dine
as
happened
occasionally
the
contents
of
the
cellar
made
them
look
at
each
other
over
their
glasses
lenox
was
very
reticent
in
all
matters
relating
to
himself
and
in
his
talks
with
his
son
which
were
mostly
at
the
table
rarely
spoke
of
business
matters
in
general
and
almost
never
of
his
own
he
had
read
well
and
was
fond
of
talking
of
his
reading
when
he
felt
in
the
vein
of
talking
which
was
not
always
but
john
had
invariably
found
him
ready
with
comment
and
sympathy
upon
the
topics
in
which
he
himself
had
interest
and
there
was
a
strong
if
undemonstrative
affection
between
the
father
and
son
it
was
not
strange
perhaps
all
things
considered
that
john
had
come
even
to
nearly
with
no
more
settled
intentions
that
his
boyhood
should
have
been
so
long
he
was
not
at
all
of
a
reckless
disposition
and
notwithstanding
the
desultory
way
in
which
he
had
spent
time
he
had
strong
mental
and
moral
fiber
and
was
capable
of
feeling
deeply
and
enduringly
he
had
been
desultory
but
never
before
had
he
had
much
reason
or
warning
against
it
but
now
he
reflected
a
time
had
come
work
he
must
if
only
for
work
sake
and
work
he
would
and
there
was
a
touch
of
in
the
thought
of
his
increasing
years
and
of
his
lonely
life
he
might
have
been
a
help
and
a
companion
during
those
two
years
of
his
not
very
fruitful
european
sojourn
and
he
would
lose
no
time
in
finding
out
what
there
was
for
him
to
do
and
in
setting
about
it
chapter
vii
the
day
seemed
very
long
he
ate
his
luncheon
having
first
paid
a
visit
to
ann
who
gave
him
an
effusive
welcome
jeffrey
waited
and
during
the
meal
they
had
some
further
talk
and
among
other
things
john
said
to
him
does
my
father
dress
for
dinner
nowadays
no
sir
was
the
reply
i
do
know
when
i
seen
your
father
in
his
evenin
clothes
sir
not
for
a
long
time
and
then
maybe
two
or
three
times
the
past
year
when
he
was
going
out
to
dinner
but
not
here
sir
maybe
it
be
different
now
you
back
again
sir
after
luncheon
john
luggage
arrived
and
he
superintended
the
unpacking
but
that
employment
was
comparatively
brief
the
day
dragged
with
him
truly
his
was
rather
a
dreary
affair
how
different
had
been
yesterday
and
the
day
before
and
all
those
days
before
when
he
had
so
enjoyed
the
ship
life
and
most
of
all
the
daily
hour
or
more
of
the
companionship
which
had
grown
to
be
of
such
surpassing
interest
to
him
and
now
seemed
so
utterly
a
thing
of
the
past
of
course
he
should
see
her
again
he
put
aside
a
wonder
if
it
would
be
within
the
proprieties
on
that
evening
or
at
latest
the
next
but
in
any
case
the
episode
as
he
had
said
to
her
was
done
and
it
had
been
very
pleasant
oh
yes
very
dear
to
him
he
wondered
if
she
was
finding
the
day
as
interminable
as
it
seemed
to
him
and
if
the
interval
before
they
saw
each
other
again
would
seem
as
long
as
his
impatience
would
make
it
for
him
finally
the
restless
dullness
became
intolerable
he
sallied
forth
into
the
weather
and
went
to
his
club
having
been
on
footing
during
his
absence
and
finding
some
men
whom
he
knew
spent
there
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
his
father
was
at
home
and
in
his
room
when
john
got
back
well
father
he
said
the
prodigal
has
returned
he
is
very
welcome
was
the
reply
as
the
elder
man
took
both
his
son
hands
and
looked
at
him
affectionately
you
seem
very
well
yes
said
john
and
how
are
you
sir
about
as
usual
i
think
said
lenox
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
silence
john
thought
that
his
father
seemed
thinner
than
formerly
and
he
had
instantly
observed
that
a
white
beard
covered
the
always
hitherto
chin
but
he
made
no
comment
the
old
place
appears
very
familiar
he
remarked
nothing
is
changed
or
even
moved
as
i
can
see
and
ann
and
jeff
are
just
the
same
old
sixpences
as
ever
yes
said
his
father
two
years
make
less
difference
with
old
people
and
their
old
habits
than
with
young
ones
you
will
have
changed
more
than
we
have
i
fancy
do
we
dress
for
dinner
asked
john
after
some
little
more
unimportant
talk
yes
said
his
father
in
honor
of
the
occasion
if
you
like
i
have
done
it
lately
he
added
a
little
wearily
i
have
had
such
a
glass
of
wine
since
i
left
home
john
remarked
as
they
sat
together
after
dinner
no
said
his
father
looking
thoughtfully
at
his
glass
it
the
old
and
pretty
nearly
the
last
of
it
it
very
old
and
wants
drinking
he
observed
as
he
held
his
glass
up
to
get
the
color
it
has
gone
off
a
bit
even
in
two
years
all
right
said
john
cheerfully
we
drink
it
to
save
it
if
needs
be
the
elder
man
smiled
and
filled
both
glasses
there
had
been
more
or
less
talk
during
the
meal
but
nothing
of
special
moment
john
sat
back
in
his
chair
absently
twirling
the
stem
of
his
glass
between
thumb
and
fingers
presently
he
said
looking
straight
before
him
at
the
table
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
of
late
more
than
ever
before
positively
in
fact
that
whatever
my
prospects
may
be
he
did
not
see
the
momentary
contraction
of
his
father
brow
i
ought
to
begin
some
sort
of
a
career
in
earnest
i
afraid
he
continued
that
i
have
been
rather
unmindful
and
that
i
might
have
been
of
some
use
to
you
as
well
as
myself
if
i
had
stayed
at
home
instead
of
spending
the
last
two
years
in
europe
i
trust
said
his
father
that
they
have
not
been
entirely
without
profit
no
said
john
perhaps
not
wholly
but
their
cash
value
would
not
be
large
i
afraid
all
value
is
not
to
be
measured
in
dollars
and
cents
remarked
lenox
if
i
could
have
acquired
as
much
german
and
french
as
i
presume
you
have
to
say
nothing
of
other
things
i
should
look
back
upon
the
time
as
well
spent
at
almost
any
cost
at
your
age
a
year
or
two
more
or
less
you
do
realize
it
now
but
you
will
if
you
come
to
my
age
does
count
for
so
very
much
and
you
are
not
too
old
he
smiled
to
begin
at
a
beginning
i
want
to
begin
said
john
yes
said
his
father
i
want
to
have
you
and
i
have
had
the
matter
a
good
deal
in
my
mind
have
you
any
idea
as
to
what
you
wish
to
do
i
thought
said
john
that
the
most
obvious
thing
would
be
to
go
into
your
office
lenox
reached
over
for
the
his
cigar
had
gone
out
and
his
hand
shook
as
he
applied
the
flame
to
it
he
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
i
understand
he
said
at
last
it
would
seem
the
obvious
thing
to
do
as
you
say
but
he
clicked
his
teeth
together
doubtfully
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
managed
at
present
and
i
do
think
it
is
what
i
should
desire
for
you
in
any
case
the
fact
is
he
went
on
my
business
has
always
been
a
sort
of
specialty
and
though
it
is
still
worth
doing
perhaps
it
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
conditions
and
methods
have
changed
and
he
added
i
am
too
old
to
change
with
them
i
am
not
said
john
in
fact
resumed
his
father
ignoring
john
assertion
as
things
are
going
now
i
could
make
a
place
for
you
in
my
office
unless
i
displaced
melig
and
made
you
my
manager
and
for
many
reasons
i
do
that
i
am
too
dependent
on
melig
of
course
if
you
came
with
me
it
would
be
as
a
partner
but
no
said
john
i
should
be
a
poor
substitute
for
old
melig
for
a
good
while
i
fancy
my
idea
would
be
said
lenox
that
you
should
undertake
a
profession
say
the
law
it
is
a
fact
that
the
great
majority
of
men
fail
in
business
and
then
most
of
them
for
lack
of
training
or
special
aptitude
fall
into
the
ranks
of
clerks
and
subordinates
on
the
other
hand
a
man
who
has
a
profession
law
medicine
what
not
even
if
he
does
not
attain
high
rank
has
something
on
which
he
can
generally
get
along
at
least
after
a
fashion
and
he
has
the
standing
that
is
my
view
of
the
matter
and
though
i
confess
i
often
wonder
at
it
in
individual
cases
it
is
my
advice
to
you
it
would
take
three
or
four
years
to
put
me
where
i
could
earn
anything
to
speak
of
said
john
even
providing
that
i
could
get
any
business
at
the
end
of
the
time
yes
said
his
father
but
the
time
of
itself
is
of
so
much
consequence
you
would
be
living
at
home
and
would
have
your
allowance
perhaps
he
suggested
somewhat
diminished
seeing
that
you
would
be
here
i
can
get
on
with
half
of
it
said
john
confidently
we
will
settle
that
matter
afterward
said
lenox
they
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
john
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
table
unconscious
of
the
occasional
scrutiny
of
his
father
glance
at
last
he
said
well
sir
i
will
do
anything
that
you
advise
have
you
anything
to
urge
against
it
asked
lenox
not
exactly
on
my
own
account
replied
john
though
i
admit
that
the
three
years
or
more
seems
a
long
time
to
me
but
i
have
been
drawing
on
you
exclusively
all
my
life
except
for
the
little
money
i
earned
in
rush
company
office
and
you
have
done
so
my
dear
boy
said
his
father
gently
with
my
acquiescence
i
may
have
been
wrong
but
that
is
a
fact
if
in
my
judgment
the
arrangement
may
be
continued
for
a
while
longer
and
in
the
mean
time
you
are
making
progress
toward
a
definite
end
i
think
you
need
have
no
misgivings
it
gratifies
me
to
have
you
feel
as
you
do
though
it
is
no
more
than
i
should
have
expected
of
you
for
you
have
never
caused
me
any
serious
anxiety
or
disappointment
my
son
often
in
the
after
time
did
john
thank
god
for
that
assurance
thank
you
sir
he
said
putting
down
his
hand
palm
upward
on
the
table
and
his
eyes
filled
as
the
elder
man
laid
his
hand
in
his
and
they
gave
each
other
a
lingering
pressure
lenox
divided
the
last
of
the
wine
in
the
bottle
between
the
two
glasses
and
they
drank
it
in
silence
as
if
in
pledge
i
will
go
in
to
see
carey
carey
in
the
morning
and
if
they
are
agreeable
you
can
see
them
afterward
said
lenox
they
are
not
one
of
the
great
firms
but
they
have
a
large
and
good
practice
and
they
are
friends
of
mine
shall
i
do
so
he
asked
looking
at
his
son
if
you
will
be
so
kind
john
replied
returning
his
look
and
so
the
matter
was
concluded
chapter
viii
this
history
will
not
concern
itself
to
any
extent
with
our
career
as
a
law
clerk
though
as
he
promised
himself
he
took
it
seriously
and
laboriously
while
it
lasted
notwithstanding
that
after
two
years
of
being
his
own
master
and
the
rather
desultory
and
altogether
congenial
life
he
had
led
he
found
it
at
first
even
more
irksome
than
he
had
fancied
the
novice
penetrates
but
slowly
the
mysteries
of
the
law
and
unless
he
be
of
unusual
aptitude
and
imagination
the
interesting
and
remunerative
part
seems
for
a
long
time
very
far
off
but
john
stuck
manfully
to
the
reading
and
was
diligent
in
all
that
was
put
upon
him
to
do
and
after
a
while
the
days
spent
in
the
office
and
in
the
work
appointed
to
him
began
to
pass
more
quickly
he
restrained
his
impulse
to
call
at
street
until
what
seemed
to
him
a
fitting
interval
had
elapsed
one
which
was
longer
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
from
an
instinct
of
shyness
not
habitual
to
him
and
a
distrustful
apprehension
that
perhaps
his
advent
was
not
of
so
much
moment
to
the
people
there
as
to
him
but
their
greeting
was
so
cordial
on
every
hand
that
carling
remark
that
they
had
been
almost
afraid
he
had
forgotten
them
embarrassed
while
it
pleased
him
and
his
explanations
were
somewhat
lame
miss
blake
as
usual
came
to
the
rescue
though
john
disconcert
was
not
lessened
by
the
suspicion
that
she
saw
through
his
inventions
he
had
conceived
a
great
opinion
of
that
young
person
penetration
his
talk
for
a
while
was
mostly
with
carling
who
was
in
a
pleasant
mood
being
like
most
nervous
people
at
his
best
in
the
evening
mary
made
an
occasional
contributory
remark
and
carling
as
was
her
wont
was
silent
except
when
appealed
to
finally
carling
rose
and
putting
out
his
hand
said
i
think
i
will
excuse
myself
if
you
will
permit
me
i
have
had
to
be
down
town
and
am
rather
tired
carling
followed
him
saying
to
john
as
she
bade
him
good
night
do
come
lenox
whenever
you
feel
like
it
we
are
very
quiet
people
and
are
almost
always
at
home
thank
you
carling
responded
john
with
much
sincerity
i
shall
be
most
glad
to
i
am
so
quiet
myself
as
to
be
practically
noiseless
the
hall
of
the
carlings
house
was
their
favorite
sitting
place
in
the
evening
it
ran
nearly
the
whole
depth
of
the
house
and
had
a
wide
fireplace
at
the
end
the
further
right
hand
portion
was
recessed
by
the
stairway
which
rose
from
about
the
middle
of
its
length
miss
blake
sat
in
a
low
chair
and
john
took
its
fellow
at
the
other
angle
of
the
fireplace
which
contained
the
smoldering
remnant
of
a
wood
fire
she
had
a
bit
of
embroidery
stretched
over
a
circular
frame
like
a
needlework
was
not
a
passion
with
her
but
it
was
understood
in
the
carling
household
that
in
course
of
time
a
set
of
table
doilies
of
elaborate
devices
in
colored
silks
would
be
forthcoming
it
has
been
deplored
by
some
philosopher
that
custom
does
not
sanction
such
little
occupations
for
masculine
hands
it
would
be
interesting
to
speculate
how
many
embarrassing
or
disastrous
consequences
might
have
been
averted
if
at
a
critical
point
in
a
negotiation
or
controversy
a
needle
had
had
to
be
threaded
or
a
dropped
stitch
taken
up
before
a
reply
was
made
to
say
nothing
of
an
excuse
for
averting
features
at
times
without
confession
of
confusion
the
great
and
wise
charles
reade
tells
how
his
hero
who
had
an
island
a
treasure
ship
and
a
few
other
trifles
of
the
sort
to
dispose
of
insisted
upon
captain
fullalove
throwing
away
the
stick
he
was
whittling
as
giving
the
captain
an
unfair
advantage
the
value
of
the
embroidered
doily
as
an
article
of
table
napery
may
be
open
to
question
but
its
value
in
an
unfinished
state
as
an
adjunct
to
discreet
conversation
is
beyond
all
dispute
ought
i
to
say
good
night
asked
john
with
a
smile
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
disappearance
of
and
carling
i
do
see
any
reason
she
replied
it
is
late
julius
is
in
one
of
his
periods
of
retiring
early
just
now
by
and
by
he
will
be
sure
to
take
up
the
idea
again
that
his
best
sleep
is
after
midnight
at
present
he
is
on
the
theory
that
it
is
before
twelve
how
has
he
been
since
your
return
john
asked
better
in
some
ways
i
think
she
replied
he
seems
to
enjoy
the
home
life
in
contrast
with
the
traveling
about
and
living
in
hotels
and
then
in
a
moderate
way
he
is
obliged
to
give
some
attention
to
business
matters
and
to
come
in
contact
with
men
and
affairs
generally
and
you
said
john
you
find
it
pleasant
to
be
back
yes
she
said
i
do
as
my
sister
said
we
are
quiet
people
she
goes
out
so
little
that
it
is
almost
not
at
all
and
when
i
go
it
has
nearly
always
to
be
with
some
one
else
and
then
you
know
that
while
alice
and
i
are
originally
new
yorkers
we
have
only
been
back
here
for
two
or
three
years
most
of
the
people
really
to
whose
houses
we
go
are
those
who
knew
my
father
but
she
added
it
is
a
comfort
not
to
be
carrying
about
a
traveling
bag
in
one
hand
and
a
weight
of
responsibility
in
the
other
i
should
think
said
john
laughing
that
your
maid
might
have
taken
the
bag
even
if
she
could
carry
your
responsibilities
no
she
said
joining
in
his
laugh
that
particular
bag
was
too
precious
and
eliza
was
one
of
my
most
serious
responsibilities
she
had
to
be
looked
after
like
the
luggage
and
i
used
to
wish
at
times
that
she
could
be
labeled
and
go
in
the
van
how
has
it
been
with
you
since
your
return
and
as
she
separated
a
needleful
of
silk
from
what
seemed
an
inextricable
tangle
if
i
may
ask
what
have
you
been
doing
i
was
recalling
she
added
putting
the
silk
into
the
needle
some
things
you
said
to
me
on
the
altruria
do
you
remember
perfectly
said
john
i
think
i
remember
every
word
said
on
both
sides
and
i
have
thought
very
often
of
some
things
you
said
to
me
in
fact
they
had
more
influence
upon
my
mind
than
you
imagined
she
turned
her
work
so
that
the
light
would
fall
a
little
more
directly
upon
it
really
she
asked
in
what
way
you
put
in
a
drop
or
two
that
crystallized
the
whole
solution
he
answered
she
looked
up
at
him
inquiringly
yes
he
said
i
always
knew
that
i
should
have
to
stop
drifting
some
time
but
there
never
seemed
to
be
any
particular
time
some
things
you
said
to
me
set
the
time
i
am
under
steam
at
present
behold
in
me
he
exclaimed
touching
his
breast
the
future
chief
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
of
whom
you
shall
say
some
time
in
the
next
brief
interval
of
forty
years
or
so
knew
him
as
a
young
man
and
one
for
whom
no
one
would
have
predicted
such
eminence
and
perhaps
you
will
add
was
largely
owing
to
me
she
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
in
which
amusement
and
curiosity
were
blended
i
congratulate
you
she
said
laughing
upon
the
career
in
which
it
appears
i
had
the
honor
to
start
you
am
i
being
told
that
you
have
taken
up
the
law
not
quite
the
whole
of
it
as
yet
he
said
but
when
i
am
not
doing
errands
for
the
office
i
am
to
some
extent
taken
up
with
it
and
then
he
told
her
of
his
talk
with
his
father
and
what
had
followed
she
overcame
a
refractory
kink
in
her
silk
before
speaking
it
takes
a
long
time
does
it
and
do
you
like
it
she
asked
well
said
john
laughing
a
little
a
weaker
word
than
would
describe
the
pursuit
but
i
hope
with
diligence
to
reach
some
of
the
interesting
features
in
the
course
of
ten
or
twelve
years
it
is
delightful
she
remarked
scrutinizing
the
pattern
of
her
work
to
encounter
such
enthusiasm
is
it
said
john
not
in
the
least
wounded
by
her
sarcasm
very
much
so
she
replied
but
i
have
always
understood
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
be
too
sanguine
perhaps
i
better
make
it
fifteen
years
then
he
said
laughing
i
should
have
a
choice
of
professions
by
that
time
at
any
rate
you
know
the
proverb
that
forty
every
man
is
either
a
fool
or
a
physician
she
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
yes
he
said
i
realize
the
alternative
she
laughed
a
little
but
did
not
reply
seriously
he
continued
i
know
that
in
everything
worth
accomplishing
there
is
a
lot
of
drudgery
to
be
gone
through
with
at
the
first
and
perhaps
it
seems
the
more
irksome
to
me
because
i
have
been
so
long
idly
my
own
master
however
he
added
i
shall
get
down
to
it
or
up
to
it
after
a
while
i
dare
say
that
is
my
intention
at
any
rate
i
do
think
i
have
ever
wished
that
i
were
a
man
she
said
after
a
moment
but
i
often
find
myself
envying
a
man
opportunities
do
not
women
have
opportunities
too
he
said
certainly
they
have
greatly
to
do
with
the
determination
of
affairs
oh
yes
she
replied
it
is
the
usual
answer
that
woman
part
is
to
influence
somebody
as
for
her
own
life
it
is
largely
made
for
her
she
has
for
the
most
part
to
take
what
comes
to
her
by
the
will
of
others
and
yet
said
john
i
fancy
that
there
has
seldom
been
a
great
career
in
which
some
woman
help
or
influence
was
not
a
factor
even
granting
that
she
replied
the
career
was
the
man
after
all
and
the
fame
and
visible
reward
a
man
will
sometimes
say
owe
all
my
success
to
my
wife
or
my
mother
or
sister
but
he
never
really
believes
it
nor
in
fact
does
any
one
else
it
is
success
after
all
and
the
influence
of
the
woman
is
but
a
circumstance
real
and
powerful
though
it
may
be
i
am
not
sure
she
added
that
influence
so
called
is
rather
an
overrated
thing
women
like
to
feel
that
they
have
it
and
men
in
matters
which
they
hold
lightly
flatter
them
by
yielding
but
i
am
doubtful
if
a
man
ever
arrives
at
or
abandons
a
settled
course
or
conviction
through
the
influence
of
a
woman
however
exerted
i
think
you
are
wrong
said
john
and
i
feel
sure
of
so
much
as
this
that
a
man
might
often
be
or
do
for
a
woman
sake
that
which
he
would
not
for
its
sake
or
his
own
that
is
quite
another
thing
she
said
there
is
in
it
no
question
of
influence
it
is
one
of
impulse
and
motive
i
have
told
you
said
john
that
what
you
said
to
me
had
influenced
me
greatly
pardon
me
she
replied
you
employed
a
figure
which
exactly
defined
your
condition
you
said
i
supplied
the
drop
which
caused
the
solution
to
crystallize
that
is
to
elaborate
your
illustration
that
it
was
already
at
the
point
of
saturation
with
your
own
convictions
and
intentions
i
said
also
he
urged
that
you
had
set
the
time
for
me
is
the
idea
unpleasant
to
you
he
asked
after
a
moment
while
he
watched
her
face
she
did
not
at
once
reply
but
presently
she
turned
to
him
with
slightly
heightened
color
and
said
ignoring
his
question
would
you
rather
think
that
you
had
done
what
you
thought
right
because
you
so
thought
or
because
some
one
else
wished
to
have
you
or
i
should
say
would
you
rather
think
that
the
right
suggestion
was
another
than
your
own
he
laughed
a
little
and
said
evasively
you
ought
to
be
a
lawyer
miss
blake
i
should
hate
to
have
you
me
unless
i
were
very
sure
of
my
evidence
she
gave
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
in
reply
as
she
turned
and
resumed
her
embroidery
they
talked
for
a
while
longer
but
of
other
things
the
discussion
of
woman
influence
having
been
dropped
by
mutual
consent
after
john
departure
she
suspended
operations
on
the
doily
and
sat
for
a
while
gazing
reflectively
into
the
fire
she
was
a
person
as
frank
with
herself
as
with
others
and
with
as
little
vanity
as
was
compatible
with
being
human
which
is
to
say
that
though
she
was
not
without
it
it
was
of
the
sort
which
could
be
gratified
but
not
flattered
in
fact
the
sort
which
flattery
wounds
rather
than
pleases
but
despite
her
apparent
skepticism
she
had
not
been
displeased
by
john
assertion
that
she
had
influenced
him
in
his
course
she
had
expressed
herself
truly
believing
that
he
would
have
done
as
he
had
without
her
intervention
but
she
thought
that
he
was
sincere
and
it
was
pleasant
to
her
to
have
him
think
as
he
did
considering
the
surroundings
and
conditions
under
which
she
had
lived
she
had
had
her
share
of
the
acquaintance
and
attentions
of
agreeable
men
but
none
of
them
had
ever
got
with
her
beyond
the
stage
of
mere
friendliness
there
had
never
been
one
whose
coming
she
had
particularly
looked
forward
to
or
whose
going
she
had
deplored
she
had
thought
of
marriage
as
something
she
might
come
to
but
she
had
promised
herself
that
it
should
be
on
such
conditions
as
were
she
was
aware
quite
improbable
of
ever
being
fulfilled
she
would
not
care
for
a
man
because
he
was
clever
and
distinguished
but
she
felt
that
he
must
be
those
things
and
to
have
besides
those
qualities
of
character
and
person
which
should
attract
her
she
had
known
a
good
many
men
who
were
clever
and
to
some
extent
distinguished
but
none
who
had
attracted
her
personally
john
lenox
did
not
strike
her
as
being
particularly
clever
and
he
certainly
was
not
distinguished
nor
she
thought
ever
very
likely
to
be
but
she
had
had
a
pleasure
in
being
with
him
which
she
had
never
experienced
in
the
society
of
any
other
man
and
underneath
some
boyish
ways
she
divined
a
strength
and
steadfastness
which
could
be
relied
upon
at
need
and
she
admitted
to
herself
that
during
the
ten
days
since
her
return
though
she
had
unsparingly
snubbed
her
wonderings
why
he
did
not
call
she
had
speculated
a
good
deal
upon
the
subject
herself
with
a
sort
of
resentful
feeling
against
both
herself
and
him
that
she
should
care
her
face
flushed
as
she
recalled
the
momentary
pressure
of
his
hand
upon
hers
on
that
last
night
on
deck
she
rang
for
the
servant
and
went
up
to
her
room
chapter
ix
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
narrative
to
dwell
minutely
upon
the
events
of
the
next
few
months
truth
to
say
they
were
devoid
of
incidents
of
sufficient
moment
in
themselves
to
warrant
chronicle
what
they
led
up
to
was
memorable
enough
as
time
went
on
john
found
himself
on
terms
of
growing
intimacy
with
the
carling
household
and
eventually
it
came
about
that
if
there
passed
a
day
when
their
door
did
not
open
to
him
it
was
carling
was
ostensibly
more
responsible
than
the
ladies
for
the
frequency
of
our
friend
visits
and
grew
to
look
forward
to
them
in
fact
he
seemed
to
regard
them
as
paid
primarily
to
himself
and
ignored
an
occasional
suggestion
on
his
wife
part
that
it
might
not
be
wholly
the
pleasure
of
a
chat
and
a
game
at
cards
with
him
that
brought
the
young
man
so
often
to
the
house
and
when
once
she
ventured
to
concern
him
with
some
stirrings
of
her
mind
on
the
subject
he
rather
testily
for
him
her
misgivings
remarking
that
mary
was
her
own
mistress
and
so
far
as
he
had
ever
seen
remarkably
well
qualified
to
regulate
her
own
affairs
had
she
ever
seen
anything
to
lead
her
to
suppose
that
there
was
any
particular
sentiment
existing
between
lenox
and
her
sister
no
said
carling
perhaps
not
exactly
but
you
know
how
those
things
go
and
he
always
stays
after
we
come
up
when
she
is
at
home
to
which
her
husband
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
began
a
protracted
wavering
as
to
the
advisability
of
leaving
the
steam
on
or
turning
it
off
for
the
night
which
was
a
cold
one
a
dilemma
which
involving
his
personal
welfare
or
comfort
at
the
moment
permitted
no
consideration
of
other
matters
to
share
his
mind
carling
had
not
spoken
to
her
sister
upon
the
subject
she
thought
that
that
young
woman
if
she
were
not
as
carling
said
remarkably
well
qualified
to
regulate
her
own
affairs
at
least
held
the
opinion
that
she
was
very
strongly
the
two
were
devotedly
fond
of
each
other
but
carling
was
the
elder
by
twenty
years
and
in
her
love
was
an
element
of
maternal
solicitude
to
which
her
sister
while
giving
love
for
love
in
fullest
measure
did
not
fully
respond
the
elder
would
have
liked
to
share
every
thought
but
she
was
neither
so
strong
nor
so
clever
as
the
girl
to
whom
she
had
been
almost
as
a
mother
and
who
though
perfectly
truthful
and
frank
when
she
was
minded
to
express
herself
gave
as
a
rule
little
satisfaction
to
attempts
to
explore
her
mind
and
on
some
subjects
was
capable
of
meeting
such
attempts
with
impatience
not
to
say
resentment
a
fact
of
which
her
sister
was
quite
aware
but
as
time
went
on
and
the
frequency
of
john
visits
and
attentions
grew
into
a
settled
habit
carling
uneasiness
with
which
perhaps
was
mingled
a
bit
of
curiosity
got
the
better
of
her
reserve
and
she
determined
to
get
what
satisfaction
could
be
obtained
for
it
they
were
sitting
in
carling
room
which
was
over
the
in
the
front
of
the
house
a
fire
of
cannel
blazed
in
the
grate
a
furious
storm
was
whirling
outside
carling
was
occupied
with
some
sort
of
needlework
and
her
sister
with
a
writing
pad
on
her
lap
was
composing
a
letter
to
a
friend
with
whom
she
carried
on
a
desultory
and
rather
correspondence
presently
she
yawned
slightly
and
putting
down
her
pad
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
what
a
day
she
exclaimed
it
seems
to
get
worse
and
worse
positively
you
ca
see
across
the
street
it
like
a
western
blizzard
it
is
really
said
carling
and
then
moved
by
the
current
of
thought
which
had
been
passing
in
her
mind
of
late
i
fancy
we
shall
spend
the
evening
by
ourselves
that
would
not
be
so
unusual
as
to
be
extraordinary
would
it
said
mary
would
it
suggested
carling
in
a
tone
that
was
meant
to
be
slightly
quizzical
we
are
by
ourselves
most
evenings
are
we
not
responded
her
sister
without
turning
around
why
do
you
particularize
i
was
thinking
answered
carling
bending
a
little
closer
over
her
work
that
even
lenox
would
hardly
venture
out
in
such
a
storm
unless
it
were
absolutely
necessary
oh
yes
to
be
sure
lenox
very
likely
not
was
miss
comment
in
a
tone
of
indifferent
recollection
he
comes
here
very
often
almost
every
night
in
fact
remarked
carling
looking
up
sideways
at
her
sister
back
now
that
you
mention
it
said
mary
dryly
i
have
noticed
something
of
the
sort
myself
do
you
think
he
ought
to
asked
her
sister
after
a
moment
of
silence
why
not
said
the
girl
turning
to
her
questioner
for
the
first
time
and
why
should
i
think
he
should
or
should
not
does
he
come
to
see
julius
and
on
julius
invitation
i
have
never
asked
him
but
once
she
said
flushing
a
little
as
she
recalled
the
occasion
and
the
wording
of
the
invitation
do
you
think
returned
carling
that
his
visits
are
wholly
on
julius
account
and
that
he
would
come
so
often
if
there
were
no
other
inducement
you
know
she
continued
pressing
her
point
timidly
but
persistently
he
always
stays
after
we
go
upstairs
if
you
are
at
home
and
i
have
noticed
that
when
you
are
out
he
always
goes
before
our
time
for
retiring
i
should
say
was
the
rejoinder
that
that
was
very
much
the
proper
thing
whether
or
not
he
comes
here
too
often
is
not
for
me
to
say
i
have
no
opinion
on
the
subject
but
to
do
him
justice
he
is
about
the
last
man
to
wait
for
a
tacit
dismissal
or
to
cause
you
and
julius
to
depart
from
what
he
knows
to
be
your
regular
habit
out
of
politeness
to
him
he
is
a
person
of
too
much
delicacy
and
good
breeding
to
stay
when
if
that
is
to
say
she
turned
again
to
the
window
without
completing
her
sentence
and
though
carling
thought
she
could
complete
it
for
her
she
wisely
forbore
after
a
moment
of
silence
mary
said
in
a
voice
devoid
of
any
traces
of
confusion
you
asked
me
if
i
thought
lenox
would
come
so
often
if
there
were
no
object
in
his
coming
except
to
see
julius
i
can
only
say
that
if
julius
were
out
of
the
question
i
think
he
would
come
here
but
seldom
but
she
added
as
she
left
the
window
and
resumed
her
seat
i
do
not
quite
see
the
object
of
this
discussion
and
indeed
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
what
we
are
discussing
do
you
object
she
asked
looking
curiously
at
her
sister
and
smiling
slightly
to
lenox
coming
here
as
he
does
and
if
so
why
this
was
apparently
more
direct
than
carling
was
quite
prepared
for
and
if
you
do
mary
proceeded
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
am
i
to
make
him
understand
that
it
is
not
considered
the
proper
thing
or
will
you
or
shall
we
leave
it
to
julius
carling
looked
up
into
her
sister
face
in
which
was
a
smile
of
amused
penetration
and
looked
down
again
in
visible
embarrassment
the
young
woman
laughed
as
she
shook
her
finger
at
her
oh
you
transparent
goose
she
cried
what
did
he
say
what
did
who
say
was
the
evasive
response
julius
said
mary
putting
her
finger
under
her
sister
chin
and
raising
her
face
tell
me
now
you
been
talking
with
him
and
i
insist
upon
knowing
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
there
well
she
admitted
hesitatingly
i
said
to
him
something
like
what
i
have
to
you
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
lenox
came
very
often
and
that
i
did
not
believe
it
was
all
on
his
account
and
that
he
somebody
please
invent
another
pronoun
always
stayed
when
you
were
at
home
and
broke
in
her
sister
that
you
were
afraid
my
young
affections
were
being
engaged
and
that
after
all
we
did
know
much
if
anything
about
the
young
man
or
perhaps
that
he
was
forming
a
hopeless
attachment
and
so
on
no
said
carling
i
did
say
that
exactly
i
did
you
really
said
mary
teasingly
one
ought
to
be
explicit
in
such
cases
do
you
think
well
what
did
julius
say
was
he
very
much
concerned
carling
face
colored
faintly
under
her
raillery
and
she
gave
a
little
embarrassed
laugh
come
now
said
the
girl
relentlessly
what
did
he
say
well
answered
carling
i
must
admit
that
he
said
for
one
thing
and
that
you
were
your
own
mistress
and
so
far
as
he
had
seen
you
were
very
well
qualified
to
manage
your
own
affairs
her
sister
clapped
her
hands
such
discrimination
have
i
not
seen
she
exclaimed
no
not
in
israel
what
else
did
he
say
she
demanded
with
a
dramatic
gesture
let
us
know
the
worst
carling
laughed
a
little
i
do
remember
she
admitted
that
he
said
anything
more
on
the
subject
he
got
into
some
perplexity
about
whether
the
steam
should
be
off
or
on
and
after
that
question
was
settled
we
went
to
bed
mary
laughed
outright
so
julius
does
think
i
need
watching
she
said
mary
protested
her
sister
in
a
hurt
tone
you
do
think
i
ever
did
or
could
watch
you
i
do
want
to
pry
into
your
secrets
dear
and
she
looked
up
with
tears
in
her
eyes
the
girl
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
her
sister
and
put
her
arms
about
her
neck
you
precious
old
lamb
she
cried
i
know
you
do
you
could
pry
into
anybody
secrets
if
you
tried
you
could
even
try
but
i
have
any
dear
and
i
tell
you
every
one
of
them
and
rather
than
see
a
tear
in
your
dear
eyes
i
would
tell
john
lenox
that
i
never
wanted
to
see
him
again
and
i
do
know
what
you
have
been
thinking
but
i
have
thought
so
at
all
which
last
assertion
made
even
carling
laugh
and
i
know
that
i
have
been
teasing
and
horrid
and
if
you
wo
put
me
in
the
closet
i
will
be
good
and
answer
every
question
like
a
nice
little
girl
whereupon
she
gave
her
sister
a
kiss
and
resumed
her
seat
with
an
air
of
abject
penitence
which
lasted
for
a
minute
then
she
laughed
again
though
there
was
a
watery
gleam
in
her
own
eyes
carling
gave
her
a
look
of
great
love
and
admiration
i
ought
not
to
have
brought
up
the
subject
she
said
knowing
as
i
do
how
you
feel
about
such
discussions
but
i
love
you
so
much
that
sometimes
i
ca
help
alice
exclaimed
the
girl
please
have
the
kindness
to
call
me
a
selfish
p
i
it
will
relieve
my
feelings
but
i
do
not
think
you
are
said
carling
literally
but
i
am
at
times
declared
mary
and
you
deserve
not
only
to
have
but
to
be
shown
all
the
love
and
confidence
that
i
can
give
you
only
this
that
sometimes
your
solicitude
makes
you
imagine
things
that
do
not
exist
and
you
think
i
am
withholding
my
confidence
and
then
again
i
am
enough
like
other
people
that
i
do
always
know
exactly
what
i
do
think
now
about
this
matter
do
say
a
word
about
it
dear
her
sister
interrupted
unless
you
would
rather
than
not
i
wish
to
said
mary
of
course
i
am
not
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
lenox
comes
here
very
often
nor
that
he
seems
to
like
to
stay
and
talk
with
me
because
do
you
know
if
he
did
he
could
go
when
you
do
and
i
do
mind
admitting
that
as
a
general
thing
i
like
to
have
him
stay
but
as
i
said
to
you
if
it
were
for
julius
he
would
not
come
here
very
often
do
you
think
said
carling
now
on
an
assured
footing
that
if
it
were
not
for
you
he
would
not
come
so
often
perhaps
mary
overestimated
the
attraction
which
her
had
for
lenox
and
she
smiled
slightly
as
she
thought
that
it
was
quite
possible
i
suppose
she
went
on
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
the
proceeding
is
not
strictly
conventional
and
that
the
absolutely
correct
thing
would
be
for
him
to
say
good
night
when
you
and
julius
do
and
that
there
are
those
who
would
regard
my
permitting
a
young
man
in
no
way
related
to
me
to
see
me
very
often
in
the
evening
without
the
protection
of
a
duenna
as
a
very
unbecoming
thing
i
never
have
had
such
a
thought
about
it
declared
carling
i
never
for
a
moment
supposed
you
had
dear
said
mary
nor
have
i
we
are
rather
unconventional
people
making
very
few
claims
upon
society
and
upon
whom
makes
very
few
i
am
rather
sorry
for
that
on
your
account
said
her
sister
you
need
be
was
the
rejoinder
i
have
no
yearnings
in
that
direction
which
are
not
satisfied
with
what
i
have
she
sat
for
a
minute
or
two
with
her
hands
clasped
upon
her
knee
gazing
reflectively
into
the
fire
which
in
the
growing
darkness
of
the
winter
afternoon
afforded
almost
the
only
light
in
the
room
presently
she
became
conscious
that
her
sister
was
regarding
her
with
an
air
of
expectation
and
resumed
leaving
the
question
of
the
conventions
out
of
the
discussion
as
settled
she
said
there
is
nothing
alice
that
you
need
have
any
concern
about
either
on
lenox
account
or
mine
you
like
him
do
you
asked
carling
yes
said
mary
frankly
i
like
him
very
much
we
have
enough
in
common
to
be
rather
sympathetic
and
we
differ
enough
not
to
be
dull
and
so
we
get
on
very
well
i
never
had
a
brother
she
continued
after
a
momentary
pause
but
i
feel
toward
him
as
i
fancy
i
should
feel
toward
a
brother
of
about
my
own
age
though
he
is
five
or
six
years
older
than
i
am
you
do
think
then
said
carling
timidly
that
you
are
getting
to
care
for
him
at
all
in
the
sense
that
you
use
the
word
was
the
reply
not
the
least
in
the
world
if
there
were
to
come
a
time
when
i
really
believed
i
should
never
see
him
again
i
should
be
sorry
but
if
at
any
time
it
were
a
question
of
six
months
or
a
year
i
do
not
think
my
equanimity
would
be
particularly
disturbed
and
how
about
him
suggested
carling
there
was
no
reply
do
you
think
he
may
care
for
you
or
be
getting
to
mary
frowned
slightly
half
closing
her
eyes
and
stirring
a
little
uneasily
in
her
chair
he
has
said
anything
to
me
on
the
subject
she
replied
evasively
would
that
be
necessary
asked
her
sister
perhaps
not
was
the
reply
if
the
fact
were
very
obvious
is
it
persisted
carling
with
unusual
tenacity
well
said
the
girl
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
have
thought
once
or
twice
that
he
entertained
some
such
idea
that
is
no
i
do
mean
to
put
it
just
that
way
i
mean
that
once
or
twice
something
has
occurred
to
give
me
that
idea
that
is
very
coherent
is
it
but
even
if
it
be
so
she
went
on
after
a
moment
with
a
wave
of
her
hands
what
of
it
what
does
it
signify
and
if
it
does
signify
what
can
i
do
about
it
you
have
thought
about
it
then
said
her
sister
as
much
as
i
have
told
you
she
answered
i
am
not
a
very
sentimental
person
i
think
and
not
very
much
on
the
lookout
for
such
things
but
i
know
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
man
taking
a
fancy
to
a
young
woman
under
circumstances
which
bring
them
often
together
and
i
have
been
led
to
believe
that
it
is
necessarily
fatal
to
the
man
even
if
nothing
comes
of
it
but
be
that
as
it
may
she
said
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
what
can
i
do
about
it
i
ca
say
to
lenox
think
you
ought
not
to
come
here
so
much
unless
i
give
a
reason
for
it
and
i
think
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
reason
except
the
danger
to
put
it
in
so
many
words
of
his
falling
in
love
with
me
i
could
quite
say
that
to
him
could
i
no
i
suppose
not
acquiesced
carling
faintly
no
i
should
say
not
remarked
the
girl
if
he
were
to
say
anything
to
me
in
the
way
of
declaration
is
the
word
is
it
it
would
be
another
matter
but
there
is
no
danger
of
that
why
not
if
he
is
fond
of
you
asked
her
sister
because
said
mary
with
an
emphatic
nod
i
wo
let
him
which
assertion
was
rather
weakened
by
her
adding
and
he
would
if
i
would
i
do
understand
said
her
sister
well
said
mary
i
do
pretend
to
know
all
that
goes
on
in
his
mind
but
allowing
or
rather
conjecturing
that
he
does
care
for
me
in
the
way
you
mean
i
have
the
least
fear
of
his
telling
me
so
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
this
that
he
is
wholly
dependent
upon
his
father
with
no
other
prospect
for
years
to
come
i
had
the
idea
somehow
said
carling
that
his
father
was
very
the
young
man
gives
one
the
impression
of
a
person
who
has
always
had
everything
that
he
wanted
i
think
that
is
so
said
mary
but
he
told
me
one
day
coming
over
on
the
steamer
that
he
knew
nothing
whatever
of
his
own
prospects
or
his
father
affairs
i
do
remember
at
least
it
does
matter
how
he
came
to
say
as
much
but
he
did
and
afterward
gave
me
a
whimsical
catalogue
of
his
acquirements
and
accomplishments
remarking
i
remember
that
was
not
a
dollar
in
the
whole
list
and
lately
though
you
must
not
fancy
that
he
discusses
his
own
affairs
with
me
he
has
now
and
then
said
something
to
make
me
guess
that
he
was
somewhat
troubled
about
them
is
he
doing
anything
asked
carling
he
told
me
the
first
evening
he
called
here
said
mary
that
he
was
studying
law
at
his
father
suggestion
but
i
do
remember
the
name
of
the
firm
in
whose
office
he
is
why
does
he
ask
his
father
about
his
prospects
said
carling
mary
laughed
you
seem
to
be
so
much
more
interested
in
the
matter
than
i
am
she
said
why
do
you
ask
him
yourself
to
which
unjustifiable
rejoinder
her
sister
made
no
reply
i
do
see
why
he
should
she
remarked
i
think
i
understand
said
mary
i
fancy
from
what
he
has
told
me
that
his
father
is
a
singularly
reticent
man
but
one
in
whom
his
son
has
always
had
the
most
implicit
confidence
i
imagine
too
that
until
recently
at
any
rate
he
has
taken
it
for
granted
that
his
father
was
wealthy
he
has
not
confided
any
misgivings
to
me
but
if
he
has
any
he
is
just
the
sort
of
person
not
to
ask
and
certainly
not
to
press
a
question
with
his
father
it
would
seem
like
carrying
delicacy
almost
too
far
remarked
carling
perhaps
it
would
said
her
sister
but
i
think
i
can
understand
and
sympathize
with
it
carling
broke
the
silence
which
followed
for
a
moment
or
two
as
if
she
were
thinking
aloud
you
have
plenty
of
money
she
said
and
colored
at
her
inadvertence
her
sister
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
with
a
humorous
smile
and
then
as
she
rose
and
touched
the
bell
button
said
that
another
reason
chapter
i
think
it
should
hardly
be
imputed
to
john
as
a
fault
or
a
shortcoming
that
he
did
not
for
a
long
time
realize
his
father
failing
powers
true
as
has
been
stated
he
had
noted
some
changes
in
appearance
on
his
return
but
they
were
not
great
enough
to
be
startling
and
though
he
thought
at
times
that
his
father
manner
was
more
subdued
than
he
had
ever
known
it
to
be
nothing
really
occurred
to
arouse
his
suspicion
or
anxiety
after
a
few
days
the
two
men
appeared
to
drop
into
their
accustomed
relation
and
routine
meeting
in
the
morning
and
at
dinner
but
as
john
picked
up
the
threads
of
his
acquaintance
he
usually
went
out
after
dinner
and
even
when
he
did
not
his
father
went
early
to
his
own
apartment
from
john
childhood
he
had
been
much
of
the
time
away
from
home
and
there
had
never
partly
from
that
circumstance
and
partly
from
the
older
man
natural
and
habitual
reserve
been
very
much
intimacy
between
them
the
father
did
not
give
his
own
confidence
and
while
always
kind
and
sympathetic
when
appealed
to
did
not
ask
his
son
and
loving
his
father
well
and
loyally
and
trusting
him
implicitly
it
did
not
occur
to
john
to
feel
that
there
was
anything
wanting
in
the
relation
it
was
as
it
had
always
been
he
was
accustomed
to
accept
what
his
father
did
or
said
without
question
and
as
is
very
often
the
case
had
always
regarded
him
as
an
old
man
he
had
never
felt
that
they
could
be
in
the
same
equation
in
truth
save
for
their
mutual
affection
they
had
little
in
common
and
if
as
may
have
been
the
case
his
father
had
any
cravings
for
a
closer
and
more
intimate
relation
he
made
no
sign
acquiescing
in
his
son
actions
as
the
son
did
in
his
without
question
or
suggestion
they
did
not
know
each
other
and
such
cases
are
not
rare
more
is
the
pity
but
as
time
went
on
even
john
unwatchful
eye
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
all
was
not
well
with
his
father
haggard
lines
were
multiplying
in
the
quiet
face
and
the
silence
at
the
dinner
table
was
often
unbroken
except
by
john
unfruitful
efforts
to
keep
some
sort
of
a
conversation
in
motion
more
and
more
frequently
it
occurred
that
his
father
would
retire
to
his
own
room
immediately
after
dinner
was
over
and
the
food
on
his
plate
would
be
almost
untouched
while
he
took
more
wine
than
had
ever
been
his
habit
john
retiring
late
would
often
hear
him
stirring
uneasily
in
his
room
and
it
would
be
plain
in
the
morning
that
he
had
spent
a
wakeful
if
not
a
sleepless
night
once
or
twice
on
such
a
morning
john
had
suggested
to
his
father
that
he
should
not
go
down
to
the
office
and
the
suggestion
had
been
met
with
so
irritable
a
negative
as
to
excite
his
wonder
it
was
a
day
in
the
latter
part
of
march
the
winter
had
been
unusually
severe
and
lingered
into
spring
with
a
tenacity
occasional
hints
of
clemency
and
promise
being
followed
by
recurrences
which
were
as
irritating
as
a
personal
affront
john
had
held
to
his
work
in
the
office
if
not
with
positive
enthusiasm
at
least
with
industry
and
thought
that
he
had
made
some
progress
on
the
day
in
question
the
managing
clerk
commented
briefly
but
favorably
on
something
of
his
which
was
satisfactory
and
such
experiences
being
rare
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
mild
elation
he
was
also
cherishing
the
anticipation
of
a
call
at
street
where
for
reasons
unnecessary
to
recount
he
had
not
been
for
a
week
at
dinner
that
night
his
father
seemed
more
inclined
than
for
a
long
time
to
keep
up
a
conversation
which
though
of
no
special
import
was
cheerful
in
comparison
with
the
silence
which
had
grown
to
be
almost
the
rule
and
the
two
men
sat
for
a
while
over
the
coffee
and
cigars
presently
however
the
elder
rose
from
the
table
saying
pleasantly
i
suppose
you
are
going
out
not
if
you
like
me
to
stay
in
was
the
reply
i
have
no
definite
engagement
oh
no
said
lenox
not
at
all
not
at
all
and
as
he
passed
his
son
on
the
way
out
of
the
room
he
put
out
his
hand
and
taking
john
said
good
night
as
john
stood
for
a
moment
rather
taken
aback
he
heard
his
father
mount
the
stairs
to
his
room
he
was
puzzled
by
the
unexpected
and
unusual
occurrence
but
finally
concluded
that
his
father
realizing
how
taciturn
they
had
become
of
late
wished
to
resume
their
former
status
and
this
view
was
confirmed
to
his
mind
by
the
fact
that
they
had
been
more
companionable
than
usual
that
evening
albeit
that
nothing
of
any
special
significance
had
been
said
as
has
been
stated
a
longer
interval
than
usual
had
elapsed
since
john
last
visit
to
street
a
fact
which
had
been
commented
on
by
carling
but
not
mentioned
between
the
ladies
when
he
found
himself
at
that
hospitable
house
on
that
evening
he
was
greeted
by
miss
blake
alone
julius
did
not
come
down
and
my
sister
is
with
him
she
said
so
you
will
have
to
put
up
with
my
society
unless
you
like
me
to
send
up
for
alice
julius
is
strictly
i
should
say
do
disturb
her
i
beg
protested
john
laughing
and
wondering
a
bit
at
the
touch
of
coquetry
in
her
speech
something
unprecedented
in
his
experience
of
her
if
you
are
willing
to
put
up
with
my
society
i
hope
carling
is
not
ill
they
seated
themselves
as
she
replied
no
nothing
serious
i
should
say
a
bit
of
a
cold
i
fancy
and
for
a
fortnight
he
has
been
more
nervous
than
usual
the
changes
in
the
weather
have
been
so
great
and
so
abrupt
that
they
have
worn
upon
his
nerves
he
is
getting
very
uneasy
again
now
after
spending
the
winter
and
when
spring
is
almost
at
hand
i
believe
that
if
he
could
make
up
his
mind
where
to
go
he
would
be
for
setting
off
really
said
john
in
a
tone
of
dismay
quite
so
she
replied
with
a
nod
but
he
objected
it
seems
too
late
or
too
early
spring
may
drop
in
upon
us
any
day
is
this
something
very
recent
it
has
been
developing
for
a
week
or
ten
days
she
answered
and
symptoms
have
indicated
a
crisis
for
some
time
in
fact
she
added
with
a
little
vexed
laugh
we
have
talked
of
nothing
for
a
week
but
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
florida
california
north
carolina
south
carolina
and
virginia
at
large
besides
augustine
monterey
santa
barbara
aiken
asheville
hot
springs
old
point
comfort
bermuda
and
i
do
know
how
many
other
places
not
forgetting
atlantic
city
and
lakewood
and
only
not
barbadoes
and
the
sandwich
islands
because
nobody
happened
to
think
of
them
julius
remarked
miss
blake
would
have
given
a
forenoon
to
the
discussion
of
the
two
latter
places
as
readily
as
to
any
of
the
others
ca
you
talk
him
along
into
warm
weather
suggested
john
with
rather
a
mirthless
laugh
do
you
think
that
if
the
weather
were
to
change
for
good
as
it
likely
to
do
almost
any
time
now
he
might
put
off
going
till
the
usual
summer
flitting
the
change
in
his
mind
will
have
to
come
pretty
soon
if
i
am
to
retain
my
mental
faculties
she
declared
he
might
possibly
but
i
am
afraid
not
she
said
shaking
her
head
he
has
the
idea
fixed
in
his
mind
and
considerations
of
the
weather
here
while
they
got
him
started
are
not
now
so
much
the
question
he
has
the
moving
fever
and
i
am
afraid
it
will
have
to
run
its
course
i
think
she
said
after
a
moment
that
if
i
were
to
formulate
a
special
anathema
it
would
be
traveling
seize
you
or
restlessness
suggested
john
yes
she
said
that
more
accurate
perhaps
but
it
does
sound
quite
so
smart
julius
is
in
that
state
of
mind
when
the
only
place
that
seems
desirable
is
somewhere
else
of
course
you
will
have
to
go
said
john
mournfully
oh
yes
she
replied
with
an
air
of
compulsory
resignation
i
shall
not
only
have
to
go
of
course
but
i
shall
probably
have
to
decide
where
in
order
to
save
my
mind
but
it
will
certainly
be
somewhere
so
i
might
as
well
be
packing
my
trunks
and
you
will
be
away
indefinitely
i
suppose
yes
i
imagine
so
dear
me
john
ejaculated
in
a
dismal
tone
they
were
sitting
as
described
on
a
former
occasion
and
the
young
woman
was
engaged
upon
the
second
perhaps
the
third
or
even
the
fourth
of
the
set
of
doilies
to
which
she
had
committed
herself
she
took
some
stitches
with
a
composed
air
without
responding
to
her
exclamation
i
awfully
sorry
he
said
presently
leaning
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
hands
hanging
in
an
attitude
of
unmistakable
dejection
and
staring
fixedly
into
the
fire
i
am
very
sorry
myself
she
said
bending
her
head
a
little
closer
over
her
work
i
think
i
like
being
in
new
york
in
the
spring
better
than
at
any
other
time
and
i
do
at
all
fancy
the
idea
of
living
in
my
trunks
again
for
an
indefinite
period
i
shall
miss
you
horribly
he
said
turning
his
face
toward
her
her
eyes
opened
with
a
lift
of
the
brows
but
whether
the
surprise
so
indicated
was
quite
genuine
is
a
matter
for
conjecture
yes
he
declared
desperately
i
shall
indeed
i
should
fancy
you
must
have
plenty
of
other
friends
she
said
flushing
a
little
and
i
have
wondered
sometimes
whether
demands
upon
you
were
not
more
confident
than
warrantable
and
whether
you
would
often
rather
have
gone
elsewhere
than
to
come
here
to
play
cards
with
him
she
actually
said
this
as
if
she
meant
it
do
you
suppose
he
exclaimed
and
checked
himself
no
he
said
i
have
come
because
well
i
been
only
too
glad
to
come
and
i
suppose
it
has
got
to
be
a
habit
he
added
rather
lamely
you
see
i
never
known
any
people
in
the
way
i
have
known
you
it
has
seemed
to
me
more
like
home
life
than
anything
i
ever
known
there
has
never
been
any
one
but
my
father
and
i
and
you
can
have
no
idea
what
it
has
been
to
me
to
be
allowed
to
come
here
as
i
have
and
oh
you
must
know
he
hesitated
and
instantly
she
advanced
her
point
her
face
was
rather
white
and
the
hand
which
lay
upon
the
work
in
her
lap
trembled
a
little
while
she
clasped
the
arm
of
the
chair
with
the
other
but
she
broke
in
upon
his
hesitation
with
an
even
voice
it
has
been
very
pleasant
for
us
all
i
sure
she
said
and
frankly
i
sorry
that
it
must
be
interrupted
for
a
while
but
that
is
about
all
there
is
of
it
is
it
we
shall
probably
be
back
not
later
than
october
i
should
say
and
then
you
can
renew
your
contests
with
julius
and
your
controversies
with
me
her
tone
and
what
she
said
recalled
to
him
their
last
night
on
board
the
ship
but
there
was
no
relenting
on
this
occasion
he
realized
that
for
a
moment
he
had
been
on
the
verge
of
telling
the
girl
that
he
loved
her
and
he
realized
too
that
she
had
divined
his
impulse
and
prevented
the
disclosure
but
he
registered
a
vow
that
he
would
know
before
he
saw
her
again
whether
he
might
consistently
tell
her
his
love
and
win
or
lose
upon
the
touch
miss
blake
made
several
inaccurate
efforts
to
introduce
her
needle
at
the
exact
point
desired
and
when
that
endeavor
was
accomplished
broke
the
silence
by
saying
speaking
of
have
you
read
the
novel
i
think
it
is
charming
yes
said
john
with
his
vow
in
his
mind
but
not
sorry
for
the
diversion
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
thought
it
was
immensely
clever
but
i
confess
that
i
did
quite
sympathize
with
the
love
affairs
of
a
hero
who
was
past
forty
and
i
must
also
confess
that
i
thought
the
girl
was
well
to
put
it
in
plain
english
a
fool
mary
laughed
with
a
little
quaver
in
her
voice
do
you
know
she
said
that
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
older
than
you
are
i
know
you
awfully
wise
said
john
with
a
laugh
and
from
that
their
talk
drifted
off
into
the
safer
channels
of
their
usual
intercourse
until
he
rose
to
say
good
night
of
course
we
shall
see
you
again
before
we
go
she
said
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
oh
he
declared
i
intend
regularly
to
haunt
the
place
chapter
xi
when
john
came
down
the
next
morning
his
father
who
was
as
a
rule
the
most
punctual
of
men
had
not
appeared
he
opened
the
paper
and
sat
down
to
wait
ten
minutes
passed
fifteen
twenty
he
rang
the
bell
have
you
heard
my
father
this
morning
he
said
to
jeffrey
remembering
for
the
first
time
that
he
himself
had
not
no
sir
said
the
man
he
most
generally
coughs
a
little
in
the
morning
but
i
do
think
i
heard
him
this
morning
sir
go
up
and
see
why
he
does
come
down
said
john
and
a
moment
later
he
followed
the
servant
upstairs
to
find
him
standing
at
the
chamber
door
with
a
frightened
face
he
must
be
very
sound
asleep
sir
said
jeffrey
he
has
answered
to
my
knockin
or
callin
sir
john
tried
the
door
he
found
the
chain
bolt
on
and
it
opened
but
a
few
inches
father
he
called
and
then
again
louder
he
turned
almost
unconsciously
to
jeffrey
and
found
his
own
apprehensions
reflected
in
the
man
face
we
must
break
in
the
door
he
said
now
together
and
the
bolt
gave
way
his
father
lay
as
if
asleep
go
for
the
doctor
at
once
bring
him
back
with
you
run
he
cried
to
the
servant
custom
and
instinct
said
send
for
the
doctor
but
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
no
ministrations
would
ever
reach
the
still
figure
on
the
bed
upon
which
for
the
moment
he
could
not
look
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
how
long
such
minutes
are
before
the
doctor
came
doctor
willis
who
had
brought
john
into
the
world
and
had
been
a
lifelong
friend
of
both
father
and
son
he
went
swiftly
to
the
bed
without
speaking
and
made
a
brief
examination
while
john
watched
him
with
fascinated
eyes
and
as
the
doctor
finished
the
son
dropped
on
his
knees
by
the
bed
and
buried
his
face
in
it
the
doctor
crossed
the
room
to
jeffrey
who
was
standing
in
the
door
with
an
face
and
in
a
low
voice
gave
him
some
directions
then
as
the
man
departed
he
first
glanced
at
the
kneeling
figure
and
then
looked
searchingly
about
the
room
presently
he
went
over
to
the
grate
in
which
were
the
ashes
of
an
extinct
fire
and
taking
the
poker
pressed
down
among
them
and
covered
over
a
three
or
four
ounce
vial
he
had
found
what
he
was
looking
for
there
is
no
need
to
speak
of
the
happenings
of
the
next
few
days
nor
is
it
necessary
to
touch
at
any
length
upon
the
history
of
some
of
the
weeks
and
months
which
ensued
upon
this
crisis
in
john
lenox
life
a
time
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
he
had
ever
cared
for
had
been
taken
and
yet
with
that
unreason
which
may
perhaps
be
more
easily
understood
than
accounted
for
the
one
thing
upon
which
his
mind
most
often
dwelt
was
that
he
had
had
no
answer
to
his
note
to
mary
blake
we
know
what
happened
to
her
missive
it
turned
up
long
afterward
in
the
pocket
of
master
jacky
carling
overcoat
so
long
afterward
that
john
so
far
as
mary
was
concerned
had
disappeared
altogether
the
discovery
of
jacky
dereliction
explained
to
her
in
part
at
least
why
she
had
never
seen
him
or
heard
from
him
after
that
last
evening
at
street
the
carlings
went
away
some
ten
days
later
and
she
did
in
fact
send
another
note
to
his
house
address
asking
him
to
see
them
before
their
departure
but
john
had
considered
himself
fortunate
in
getting
the
house
off
his
hands
to
a
tenant
who
would
assume
the
lease
if
given
possession
at
once
and
had
gone
into
the
modest
apartment
which
he
occupied
during
the
rest
of
his
life
in
the
city
and
so
the
second
communication
failed
to
reach
him
perhaps
it
was
as
well
some
weeks
later
he
walked
up
to
the
carlings
house
one
sunday
afternoon
and
saw
that
it
was
closed
as
he
had
expected
by
an
impulse
which
was
not
part
of
his
original
intention
which
was
indeed
pretty
nearly
aimless
he
was
moved
to
ring
the
doorbell
but
the
maid
a
stranger
to
him
who
opened
the
door
could
tell
him
nothing
of
the
whereabouts
and
betts
the
house
man
in
charge
was
hout
so
john
retraced
his
steps
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
wholly
disproportionate
to
his
hopes
or
expectations
so
far
as
he
had
defined
them
to
himself
and
never
went
back
again
he
has
never
had
much
to
say
of
the
months
that
followed
it
came
to
be
the
last
of
october
an
errand
from
the
office
had
sent
him
to
general
wolsey
of
the
mutual
trust
company
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
by
david
harum
the
general
was
an
old
friend
of
the
elder
lenox
and
knew
john
well
and
kindly
when
the
latter
had
discharged
his
errand
and
was
about
to
go
the
general
said
wait
a
minute
are
you
in
a
hurry
if
not
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
not
specially
said
john
sit
down
said
the
general
pointing
to
a
chair
what
are
your
plans
i
see
you
are
still
in
the
careys
office
but
from
what
you
told
me
last
summer
i
conclude
that
you
are
there
because
you
have
not
found
anything
more
satisfactory
that
is
the
case
sir
john
replied
i
ca
be
idle
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
keep
on
as
i
am
going
now
and
i
have
been
trying
for
months
to
find
something
by
which
i
can
earn
a
living
i
am
afraid
he
added
that
it
will
be
a
longer
time
than
i
can
afford
to
wait
before
i
shall
be
able
to
do
that
out
of
the
law
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
said
the
general
what
are
your
resources
i
do
think
you
told
me
more
than
to
give
me
to
understand
that
your
father
affairs
were
at
a
pretty
low
ebb
of
course
i
do
not
wish
to
pry
into
your
affairs
not
at
all
john
interposed
i
am
glad
to
tell
you
and
thank
you
for
your
interest
i
have
about
two
thousand
dollars
and
there
is
some
silver
and
odds
and
ends
of
things
stored
i
do
know
what
their
value
might
be
not
very
much
i
fancy
and
there
were
a
lot
of
mining
stocks
and
that
sort
of
thing
which
have
no
value
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
no
available
value
at
any
rate
there
is
also
a
tract
of
land
somewhere
in
pennsylvania
there
is
coal
on
it
i
believe
and
some
timber
but
melig
my
father
manager
told
me
that
all
the
large
timber
had
been
cut
so
far
as
available
value
is
concerned
the
property
is
about
as
much
of
an
asset
as
the
mining
stock
with
the
disadvantage
that
i
have
to
pay
taxes
on
it
h
said
the
general
tapping
the
desk
with
his
eyeglasses
h
well
i
should
think
if
you
lived
very
economically
you
would
have
about
enough
to
carry
you
through
till
you
can
be
admitted
provided
you
feel
that
the
law
is
your
vocation
he
added
looking
up
it
was
my
father
idea
said
john
and
if
i
were
so
situated
that
i
could
go
on
with
it
i
would
but
i
am
so
doubtful
with
regard
to
my
aptitude
that
i
do
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
use
up
what
little
capital
i
have
and
some
years
of
time
on
a
doubtful
experiment
and
so
i
have
been
looking
for
something
else
to
do
well
said
the
general
if
you
were
very
much
interested
that
is
if
you
were
anxious
to
proceed
with
your
studies
i
should
advise
you
to
go
on
and
at
a
pinch
i
should
be
willing
to
help
you
out
but
feeling
as
you
do
i
hardly
know
what
to
advise
i
was
thinking
of
you
he
went
on
before
you
came
in
and
was
intending
to
send
for
you
to
come
in
to
see
me
he
took
a
letter
from
his
desk
i
got
this
yesterday
he
said
it
is
from
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
by
the
name
of
harum
who
lives
in
homeville
freeland
county
he
is
a
sort
of
a
banker
there
and
has
written
me
to
recommend
some
one
to
take
the
place
of
his
manager
or
cashier
whom
he
is
sending
away
it
rather
a
queer
move
i
think
but
then
said
the
general
with
a
smile
harum
is
a
queer
customer
in
some
ways
of
his
own
there
is
his
letter
read
it
for
yourself
the
letter
stated
that
harum
had
had
some
trouble
with
his
cashier
and
wished
to
replace
him
and
that
he
would
prefer
some
one
from
out
of
the
village
who
would
know
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
whole
region
and
blab
everything
right
and
left
i
should
want
wrote
harum
to
have
the
young
man
know
something
about
bookkeeping
and
so
on
but
i
should
not
insist
upon
his
having
been
through
a
hands
in
fact
i
would
rather
break
him
in
myself
and
if
he
willing
and
sound
and
no
vice
i
can
get
him
into
shape
i
will
pay
a
thousand
to
start
on
and
if
he
draws
and
travels
all
right
may
be
better
in
the
long
run
etc
john
handed
back
the
letter
with
a
slight
smile
which
was
reflected
in
the
face
of
the
general
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
the
latter
i
should
think
it
might
be
very
characteristic
remarked
john
yes
said
the
general
it
is
to
an
extent
you
see
he
writes
pretty
fair
english
and
he
can
on
occasion
talk
as
he
writes
but
usually
either
from
habit
or
choice
he
uses
the
most
unmitigated
dialect
but
what
i
meant
to
ask
you
was
what
do
you
think
of
the
proposal
you
mean
as
an
opportunity
for
asked
john
yes
said
general
wolsey
i
thought
of
you
at
once
thank
you
very
much
said
john
what
would
be
your
idea
well
was
the
reply
i
am
inclined
to
think
i
should
write
to
him
if
i
were
you
and
i
will
write
to
him
about
you
if
you
so
decide
you
have
had
some
office
experience
you
told
me
enough
i
should
say
for
a
foundation
and
i
do
believe
that
harum
books
and
accounts
are
very
complicated
john
did
not
speak
and
the
general
went
on
of
course
it
will
be
a
great
change
from
almost
everything
you
have
been
used
to
and
i
dare
say
that
you
may
find
the
life
at
first
at
least
pretty
dull
and
irksome
the
stipend
is
not
very
large
but
it
is
large
for
the
country
where
your
expenses
will
be
light
in
fact
i
rather
surprised
at
his
offering
so
much
at
any
rate
it
is
a
living
for
the
present
and
may
lead
to
something
better
the
place
is
a
growing
one
and
more
than
that
harum
is
well
off
and
keeps
more
irons
in
the
fire
than
one
and
if
you
get
on
with
him
you
may
do
well
i
do
think
i
should
mind
the
change
so
much
said
john
rather
sadly
my
present
life
is
so
different
in
almost
every
way
from
what
it
used
to
be
and
i
think
i
feel
it
in
new
york
more
even
than
i
might
in
a
country
village
but
the
venture
seems
a
little
like
burning
my
bridges
well
replied
the
general
if
the
experiment
should
turn
out
a
failure
for
any
reason
you
wo
be
very
much
more
at
a
loss
than
at
present
it
seems
to
me
and
of
course
i
will
do
anything
i
can
should
you
wish
me
to
be
still
on
the
lookout
for
you
here
you
are
exceedingly
kind
sir
said
john
earnestly
and
then
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
i
will
make
the
venture
he
said
at
length
and
thank
you
very
much
you
are
under
no
special
obligations
to
the
careys
are
you
asked
the
general
no
i
think
not
said
john
with
a
laugh
i
fancy
that
their
business
will
go
on
without
me
after
a
fashion
and
he
took
his
leave
chapter
xii
and
so
it
came
about
that
certain
letters
were
written
as
mentioned
in
a
previous
chapter
and
in
the
evening
of
a
dripping
day
early
in
november
john
lenox
found
himself
after
a
nine
hours
journey
the
only
traveler
who
alighted
upon
the
platform
of
the
homeville
station
which
was
near
the
end
of
a
small
lake
and
about
a
mile
from
the
village
as
he
stood
with
his
bag
and
umbrella
at
a
loss
what
to
do
he
was
accosted
by
a
short
and
stubby
individual
with
very
black
eyes
and
hair
and
a
round
face
which
would
have
been
smooth
except
that
it
had
not
been
shaved
for
a
day
or
two
goin
t
the
village
he
said
yes
said
john
that
is
my
intention
but
i
do
see
any
way
of
getting
there
carry
ye
over
fer
ten
cents
said
the
man
carryall
right
back
the
deepo
got
baggidge
two
trunks
said
john
that
make
it
thirty
cents
said
the
native
where
your
checks
all
right
you
jest
step
an
git
in
mine
the
only
rig
that
drew
over
it
was
a
long
clumsy
affair
with
windows
at
each
end
and
a
door
in
the
rear
but
open
at
the
sides
except
for
enamel
cloth
curtains
which
were
buttoned
to
the
supports
that
carried
a
railed
roof
extending
as
far
forward
as
the
dashboard
the
driver
seat
was
on
a
level
with
those
inside
john
took
a
seat
by
one
of
the
front
windows
which
was
open
but
protected
by
the
roof
his
luggage
having
been
put
on
board
they
began
the
journey
at
a
walk
the
first
part
of
the
road
being
rough
and
swampy
in
places
and
undergoing
at
intervals
the
sort
of
repairs
which
often
prevails
in
rural
regions
namely
the
deposit
of
a
quantity
of
broken
stone
which
is
left
to
be
worn
smooth
by
passing
vehicles
and
is
for
the
most
part
carefully
avoided
by
such
whenever
the
roadway
is
broad
enough
to
drive
round
the
improvement
but
the
worst
of
the
way
having
been
accomplished
the
driver
took
opportunity
speaking
sideways
over
his
shoulder
to
allay
the
curiosity
which
burned
within
him
guess
i
never
seen
you
before
john
was
tired
and
hungry
and
generally
low
in
his
mind
very
likely
not
was
his
answer
robinson
instantly
arrived
at
the
determination
that
the
stranger
was
stuck
up
but
was
in
no
degree
cast
down
thereby
i
heard
chet
timson
tellin
that
the
was
a
feller
comin
f
to
work
in
dave
harum
bank
guess
you
him
ai
ye
no
answer
this
time
theory
confirmed
my
name
robinson
imparted
that
individual
i
run
the
to
homeville
ah
responded
the
passenger
what
say
your
name
was
asked
robinson
after
he
had
steered
his
team
around
one
of
the
monuments
to
public
spirit
it
lenox
said
john
thinking
he
might
concede
something
to
such
deserving
perseverance
but
i
do
remember
mentioning
it
now
i
think
o
i
guess
you
did
admitted
robinson
think
i
ever
knowed
anybody
of
the
name
he
remarked
used
to
know
some
folks
name
o
lynch
but
they
could
ben
no
relations
i
guess
this
conjecture
elicited
no
reply
git
up
goll
darn
ye
he
exclaimed
as
one
of
the
horses
stumbled
and
he
gave
it
a
jerk
and
a
cut
of
the
whip
bought
that
hoss
of
dave
harum
he
confided
to
his
passenger
fact
i
bought
both
on
of
him
an
dum
well
stuck
i
was
too
he
added
you
know
harum
then
said
john
with
a
glimmer
of
interest
does
he
deal
in
horses
i
guess
i
make
eout
to
know
him
asserted
the
an
he
git
up
the
middle
o
the
night
any
time
to
git
the
best
of
a
hoss
trade
be
you
goin
to
work
fer
him
he
asked
encouraged
to
press
the
question
goin
to
take
timson
place
really
said
john
in
a
tone
which
advanced
robinson
opinion
to
a
rooted
conviction
i
have
never
heard
of
mr
timson
he
the
feller
that
dave
lettin
go
explained
robinson
ben
in
the
bank
a
matter
o
five
or
six
year
but
dave
got
down
on
him
fer
some
little
thing
or
other
an
he
got
his
walkin
papers
he
says
to
me
says
he
any
feller
thinks
he
come
up
here
f
or
anywheres
else
he
says
do
dave
harum
work
to
suit
him
find
he
bit
off
a
dum
sight
he
chaw
he
better
keep
his
gripsack
packed
the
hull
time
chet
says
i
thought
i
sock
it
to
the
cuss
a
little
remarked
robinson
in
recounting
the
conversation
subsequently
and
in
truth
it
was
not
elevating
to
the
spirits
of
our
friend
who
found
himself
speculating
whether
or
no
timson
might
not
be
right
where
you
goin
to
put
up
asked
robinson
after
an
interval
having
failed
to
draw
out
any
response
to
his
last
effort
is
there
more
than
one
hotel
inquired
the
passenger
the
the
eagle
an
the
lake
house
an
smith
hotel
replied
jehu
which
would
you
recommend
asked
john
said
robinson
i
do
praise
up
one
another
you
see
i
have
more
or
less
dealin
with
all
on
that
very
diplomatic
of
you
i
sure
remarked
john
not
at
all
diplomatically
i
think
i
will
try
the
eagle
robinson
in
his
account
of
the
conversation
said
in
confidence
not
wishing
to
be
openly
invidious
that
he
was
dum
if
he
almost
sorry
he
had
recommended
the
lake
house
it
may
be
inferred
from
the
foregoing
that
the
first
impression
which
our
friend
made
on
his
arrival
was
not
wholly
in
his
favor
and
robinson
conviction
that
he
was
stuck
up
and
a
person
bound
to
get
himself
disliked
was
elevated
to
an
article
of
faith
by
his
retiring
to
the
rear
of
the
vehicle
and
quite
out
of
ordinary
range
but
they
were
nearly
at
their
journey
end
and
presently
the
carryall
drew
up
at
the
eagle
hotel
it
was
a
frame
building
of
three
stories
with
a
covered
veranda
running
the
length
of
the
front
from
which
two
doors
gave
entrance
one
to
the
main
hall
the
other
to
the
office
and
bar
combined
this
was
rather
a
large
room
and
was
also
to
be
entered
from
the
main
hall
john
luggage
was
deposited
robinson
was
settled
with
and
took
his
departure
without
the
amenities
which
might
have
prevailed
under
different
conditions
and
the
new
arrival
made
his
way
into
the
office
behind
the
bar
counter
which
faced
the
street
at
one
end
of
which
was
a
small
high
desk
and
at
the
other
a
glazed
case
containing
three
or
four
partly
full
boxes
of
cigars
but
with
most
ambitious
labels
stood
the
proprietor
manager
clerk
and
what
not
of
the
hostelry
embodied
in
the
single
person
of
amos
elright
who
was
leaning
over
the
counter
in
conversation
with
three
or
four
loungers
who
sat
about
the
room
with
their
chairs
tipped
back
against
the
wall
a
sketch
of
elright
would
have
depicted
a
dull
complected
person
of
a
tousled
baldness
whose
dispirited
expression
of
countenance
was
enhanced
by
a
chin
whisker
his
shirt
and
collar
gave
unmistakable
evidence
that
pajamas
or
other
were
regarded
as
superfluities
and
his
most
conspicuous
garment
as
he
appeared
behind
the
counter
was
a
cardigan
jacket
of
a
frowsiness
beyond
compare
a
greasy
neck
scarf
was
embellished
with
a
gem
whose
truthfulness
was
without
pretence
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
accounted
for
by
a
remark
which
was
made
by
one
of
the
loungers
as
john
came
in
say
ame
the
fellow
drawled
i
guess
the
was
more
skunk
cabbidge
pie
plant
usual
that
last
lot
o
cigars
o
the
to
which
insinuation
ame
was
spared
the
necessity
of
a
rejoinder
by
our
friend
advent
guess
we
give
ye
a
room
oh
yes
you
register
if
you
want
to
where
is
the
dum
thing
i
seen
it

he
remarked

was
obvious

a
useless
formality

a

of

and
some
stewed

and
a
couple
of
boiled
eggs
and
some
coffee
he
might
have
heard
the
sound
of
a

in
the
direction
of
one
of
the
sitters
i
i

doubtfully
i

like
that
he
took
a
key
to
which
was
attached
a
huge
brass
tag
with
serrated
edges
from
a
hook
on
a
board
behind
the
bar
on
which
were
suspended
a
number
of
the
like
lighted
a
small
kerosene
lamp
carrying
a
single
wick
and
shuffling
out
from
behind
the
counter
said

gentleman
trunks

as
they
assented
he
gave
the
lamp
and
key
to
one
of
them
and
left
the
room
the
two
men
took
a
trunk
at
either
end
and
mounted
the
stairs
john
following
and
when
the
second
one
came
up
he
put
his
fingers
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
suggestively
no

the
one
addressed
as

it
to

ame
i
very
much
obliged
to

though
said
john
oh
that
all
right
remarked
dick
as
they
turned
away
john
surveyed
the
apartment
there
were
two
windows
overlooking
the
street
curtained
with
bright
cotton
near
to
one
of
them
a
small
wood
stove
and
a
wood
box
containing
some
odds
and
ends
of
sticks
and
bits
of
bark
a
small
chest
of
drawers
serving
as
a
washstand
a
malicious
little
a
basin
and
ewer
holding
about
two
quarts

earthenware
mug
and
the

thin
bit
of
red
translucent
soap
scented
with
sassafras

ordinary
wooden
chair
and
a
with
rockers
of
divergent
aims
a
yellow
wooden
bedstead
furnished
with
a
mattress
of
excelsior
calculated
to
induce
early
rising
a
dingy
white
spread
a
gray
blanket
of
coarse
wool
a
pair
of
cotton
sheets
which
had
too
obviously
done
duty
since
passing
through
the
hands
of
the
laundress
and
a
pair
of
flabby
little
pillows
in
the
same
state
in
respect
to
their
cases
as
the
sheets
on
the
floor
was
a
much
used
and
faded
ingrain
carpet
in
one
place
worn
through
by
the
edge
of
a
loose
board

narrow
strip
of

six
or
seven
wooden
pegs
to
serve
as
wardrobe
two
diminutive
towels
with
red
borders
hung
on
the
rail
of
the
washstand
and
a
battered
tin
slop
jar
minus
a
cover
completed
the
inventory
heavens
what
a
hole
exclaimed
john
and
as
he
performed
his
ablutions
not
with
the
sassafras
soap
he
promised
himself
a
speedy
flitting
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
his
host
appeared
to
announce
that
his
tea
was
ready
and
to
conduct
him
to
the
a
apartment
but
narrow
with
a
long
table
running
near
the
center
lengthwise
covered
with
a
cloth
which
bore
the
marks
of
many
a
fray
another
table
of
like
dimensions
but
bare
was
shoved
up
against
the
wall
elright
ravagement
of
the
larder
had
resulted
in
a
triangle
of
cadaverous
apple
pie
three
doughnuts
some
chunks
of
soft
white
cheese
and
a
plate
of
what
are
known
as

suggested
john
looking
dubiously
at
the
banquet

said
the
proprietor
of
the
eagle
an
i
guess
we
out
o
lawger
i
ben
intendin
to

more
he
added
a
glass
of
milk
proposed
the
guest
but
without
confidence
milkman
did
come
said
elright
shuffling
off
in
his
carpet
slippers
worn
out
in
spirit
with
the
importunities
of
the
stranger
there
was
water
on
the
table
for
it
had
been
left
there
from
supper
time
john
managed
to
consume
a
doughnut
and
some
crackers
and
cheese
and
then
went
to
his
room
carrying
the
water
pitcher
with
him
and
after
a
cigarette
or
two
and
a
small
potation
from
his
flask
to
bed
before
retiring
however
he
stripped
the
bed
with
the
intention
of
turning
the
sheets
but
upon
inspection
thought
better
of
it
and
concluded
to
leave
them
as
they
were
so
passed
his
first
night
in
homeville
and
as
he
fondly
promised
himself
his
last
at
the
eagle
hotel
when
bill
and
dick
returned
to
the
office
after
obligin
ame
they
stepped
with
one
accord
to
the
counter
and
looked
at
the
register
why
darn
it
exclaimed
bill
he
did
sign
his
name
after
all
no
said
dick
but
i
give
a
putty
near
guess
who
he
is
all
the
same
some
drummer
suggested
bill
naw
said
richard
scornfully
what

that
the
feller
that

feller

said
bill

little
too
toney
fer
these
parts
an
in
fer
dave
harum
dave
make
him
feel
as
as

he
exclaimed
slapping
his
leg
with
a
guffaw
you
notice
ame
face
when
he
said
he
did
want
much
fer
supper
only
beefsteak

a

dick
laughing
i

with
ame
heart
or
he
fell
down
hullo

he
said
when
the
gentleman
in
question
came
back
after
ministering
to
his
guest
got
the
prince
o
wales
fixed
up
all
right
did

wounded
by

events
of

i
did

no
ner
no
cow
ner
rob
no

with
that
he
proceeded
to
fill
up
the
stove
and
shut
the
dampers
that
means
i

remarked
bill
as
he
watched
the
operation
said
elright
if

time
droolin
here
swapping

inhospitable
and

bad
part
for

with
a
laugh
well
ame
if
you

run
my
face
for

i
take

little
somethin
for

good
o
the
house
before

shed
the
tear
this
proposition
was
not
declined
by
elright
but
he
felt
bound
on
business
principles
not
to
yield
with
too
great
a
show
of
readiness
i
do
mind
for
this
once
he
said
going
behind
the
bar
and
setting
out
a
bottle
and
glasses
but
i
noticed
that
it
a
damn
sight
easier
to

chapter
xiii
the
next
morning
at
nine
john
presented
himself
at
banking
office
which
occupied
the
first
floor
of
a
brick
building
some
twenty
or
feet
in
width
besides
the
entrance
to
the
bank
there
was
a
door
at
the
south
corner
opening
upon
a
stairway
leading
to
a
suite
of
two
rooms
on
the
second
floor
the
banking
office
consisted
of
two
rooms
one
in
front
containing
the
desks
and
counters
and
what
may
be
designated
as
the
parlor
as
used
to
be
the
case
in
the
provincial
towns
in
the
rear
in
which
were
harum
private
desk
a
safe
of
medium
size
the
necessary
assortment
of
chairs
and
a
lounge
there
was
also
a
large
franklin
stove
the
parlor
was
separated
from
the
front
room
by
a
partition
in
which
were
two
doors
one
leading
into
the
inclosed
space
behind
the
desks
and
counters
and
the
other
into
the
passageway
formed
by
the
north
wall
and
a
length
of
high
desk
topped
by
a
railing
the
teller
or
counter
faced
the
street
opposite
the
entrance
door
at
the
left
of
this
counter
viewed
from
the
front
was
a
desk
with
a
rail
at
the
right
was
a
space
of
counter
of
the
same
height
as
that
portion
which
was
open
across
which
latter
the
business
of
paying
and
receiving
was
conducted
as
john
entered
he
saw
standing
behind
this
open
counter
framed
as
it
were
between
the
desk
on
the
one
hand
and
the
glass
inclosure
on
the
other
a
person
whom
he
conjectured
to
be
the
chet
short
for
chester
timson
of
whom
he
had
heard
this
person
nodded
in
response
to
our
friend
good
morning
and
anticipated
his
inquiry
by
saying
you
lookin
for
dave
i
am
looking
for
harum
said
john
is
he
in
the
office
he
hai
come
in
yet
was
the
reply
up
to
the
barn
i
reckon
but
he
liable
to
come
in
any
minute
an
you
step
into
the
back
room
an
wait
fer
him
indicating
the
direction
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
business
had
not
begun
to
be
engrossing
though
the
bank
was
open
and
john
had
hardly
seated
himself
when
timson
came
into
the
back
room
and
taking
a
chair
where
he
could
see
the
counter
in
the
front
office
proceeded
to
investigate
the
stranger
of
whose
identity
he
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
but
it
was
not
timson
way
to
take
things
for
granted
in
silence
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
his
curiosity
in
this
particular
case
was
not
without
warrant
after
a
scrutiny
of
john
face
and
person
which
was
not
brief
enough
to
be
unnoticeable
he
said
with
a
directness
which
left
nothing
in
that
line
to
be
desired
i
reckon
you
the
new
man
dave
ben
gettin
up
from
the
city
i
came
up
yesterday
admitted
john
my
name
timson
said
chet
happy
to

you
said
john
rising
and
putting
out
his
hand
my
name
is
lenox
and
they
shook
hands
that
is
john
grasped
the
ends
of
four
limp
fingers
after
they
had
subsided
into
their
seats
opaquely
bluish
eyes
made
another
tour
of
inspection
in
curiosity
and
wonder
you
alwus
lived
in
the
city
he
said
at
last
it
has
always
been
my
home
was
the
reply
what
put
it
in
your
head
to
come
up
here
with
another
stare
it
was
at
harum
suggestion
replied
john
not
with
perfect
candor
but
he
was
not
minded
to
be
drawn
out
too
far
d
know
dave
i
have
never
met
him
timson
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
ever
ben
in
the
bankin
i
have
had
some
experience
of
such
accounts
in
a
general
way

said
john
smiling
at
the
little
man

to
do
up

chet
only
in
a
general
way
said
timson
i

said
john
readily
recalling

but
pele
hopkins
who

fer
a
row
o

asserted
the
speaker
with
a
wave
of
his
hands
he

about
bankin
a
cat
he
could
count
a
dollars
in
an
hour
an
as
for

git
it
twice
alike
i
do
believe
if
he
was
to
be
hung
he
must
understand
the
meaning
of
his
own
books
and
accounts
i
should
think
remarked
john
oh
said
chet
scornfully
anybody
c
do
that
that
easy
but
as
fur
the
real
is
concerned
he
do
have
nothin
to
do
with
it
it
all
ben
left
to
me
chargin
an
creditin
postin
individule
ledger
ledger
discount
register
tickler
register
checkin
off
the

drawin
off

an
writin
letters
why
ai
an
hour
the
day
in
hours
some
days
that
the
an
hour
i
ai
busy
somethin
no
sir
continued
chet
dave
give
himself
no
trouble
about
the
all
he
does
is
to
look
after
lendin
the
money
an
seein
that
it
gits
paid
when
the
time
comes
keep
track
of
how
much
money
the
is
here
an
in
an
what
notes
is
comin
due
an
a
few
things
like
that
that
do
put
pen
to
paper
ner
take
an
hour
of
his
time
why
a
man
come
in
an
want
to
git
a
note
done
an
it
be
right
or
spare
the
money
all
in
a
minute
he
do
give
it
no
thought
at
all
an
he
ai
here
half
the
time
now
said
chet
when
i
work
fer
a
man
i
like
to
have
him
so
i
say
to
him
i
do
it
so
or
shall
i
do
it
shall
i
or
i
an
then
when
i
make
a
mistake
anybody
liable
to
he
as
much
to
blame
i
be
i
suppose
then
said
john
that
you
must
have
to
keep
private
accounts
also
seeing
that
he
knows
so
little
of
details
i
have
been
told
that
he
is
interested
in
a
good
many
matters
besides
this
business
replied
timson
somewhat
disconcerted
i
suppose
he
must
keep
himself
in
kind
of
a
fashion
an
i
do
know
a
thing
about
any
outside
matters
of
though
i
suspicion
he
has
got
quite
a
few
he
got
some
books
in
that
safe
pointing
with
his
finger
an
got
a
safe
in
the
vault
but
if
you
believe
and
the
speaker
looked
as
if
he
hardly
expected
it
i
hai
never
so
much
as
seen
the
inside
of
either
one
on
no
sir
he
declared
i
hai
no
more
idee
of
what
in
them
safes
you
have
he
close
dave
harum
is
said
chet
with
a
convincing
motion
of
the
head
on
the
hull
the
clostest
man
i
ever
see
i
believe
he
averred
that
if
he
was
to
lay
out
to
keep
it
shut
that
lightnin
might
strike
him
square
in
the
mouth
an
it
would
go
in
an
eighth
of
an
inch
an
yet
he
added
he
talk
by
the
rod
when
he
takes
a
notion
must
be
a
difficult
person
to
get
on
with
commented
john
dryly
i
could
stan
it
no
longer
declared
timson
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
endured
to
the
end
of
virtue
an
i
says
to
him
the
other
day
i
says
i
ca
suit
ye
mebbe
you
better
suit
yourself
ah
said
john
politely
seeing
that
some
response
was
expected
of
him
and
what
did
he
say
to
that
he
ast
me
replied
chet
if
i
meant
by
that
to
throw
up
the
situation
i
says
sick
enough
to
throw
up
most
anythin
i
says
with
bein
found
fault
with
fer
nothin
and
then
queried
john
who
had
received
the
impression
that
the
motion
to
adjourn
had
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
replied
chet
not
quite
so
confidently
he
said
about
my
requirin
a
larger
spear
of
action
an
that
he
thought
i
do
better
on
a
mile
track
some
o
his
hoss
talk
that
another
thing
said
timson
changing
the
subject
he
all
fer
hosses
he
sooner
make
a
note
on
a
hoss
trade
than
a
hunderd
right
here
this
office
many
the
time
right
in
hours
when
i
wanted
to
ask
him
how
he
wanted
somethin
done
he
be
busy
talkin
hoss
would
pay
no
attention
to
me
if
i
there
i
am
glad
to
feel
said
john
that
you
can
not
possibly
have
any
unpleasant
feeling
toward
me
seeing
that
you
resigned
as
you
did
not
not
declared
timson
a
little
uneasily
if
it
had
ben
you
it
would
had
to
ben
somebody
else
an
now
i
seen
you
an
had
a
talk
with
you
i
guess
i
better
git
back
into
the
other
room
dave
liable
to
come
in
any
minute
but
he
said
in
parting
i
will
give
ye
piece
of
advice
you
keep
enough
laid
by
to
pay
your
gettin
back
to
you
may
want
it
in
a
hurry
and
with
this
parting
shot
the
rejected
one
took
his
leave
the
bank
parlor
was
lighted
by
a
window
and
a
glazed
door
in
the
rear
wall
and
another
window
on
the
south
side
harum
desk
was
by
the
rear
or
west
window
which
gave
view
of
his
house
standing
some
hundred
feet
back
from
the
street
the
south
or
side
window
afforded
a
view
of
his
front
yard
and
that
of
an
adjoining
dwelling
beyond
which
rose
the
wall
of
a
mercantile
block
business
was
encroaching
upon
david
domain
our
friend
stood
looking
out
of
the
south
window
to
the
left
a
bit
of
main
street
was
visible
and
the
naked
branches
of
the
elms
and
maples
with
which
it
was
bordered
were
waving
defiantly
at
their
rivals
over
the
way
incited
thereto
by
a
northwest
wind
we
invariably
form
a
mental
picture
of
every
unknown
person
of
whom
we
think
at
all
it
may
be
so
faint
that
we
are
unconscious
of
it
at
the
time
or
so
vivid
that
it
is
always
recalled
until
dissipated
by
seeing
the
person
himself
or
his
likeness
but
that
we
do
so
make
a
picture
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
upon
being
confronted
by
the
real
features
of
the
person
in
question
we
always
experience
a
certain
amount
of
surprise
even
when
we
have
not
been
conscious
of
a
different
conception
of
him
be
that
as
it
may
however
there
was
no
question
in
john
lenox
mind
as
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
at
last
came
briskly
into
the
back
office
and
interrupted
his
meditations
rather
under
the
middle
height
he
was
and
with
a
red
face
with
not
a
mole
but
a
slight
protuberance
the
size
of
half
a
large
pea
on
the
line
from
the
nostril
to
the
corner
of
the
mouth
bald
over
the
crown
and
to
a
line
a
couple
of
inches
above
the
ear
below
that
thick
and
somewhat
bushy
hair
of
yellowish
red
showing
a
mingling
of
gray
small
but
very
blue
eyes
a
thick
nose
of
no
classifiable
shape
and
a
large
mouth
with
the
lips
so
pressed
together
as
to
produce
a
slightly
downward
and
yet
rather
humorous
curve
at
the
corners
he
was
dressed
in
a
sack
coat
of
dark
with
waistcoat
and
trousers
to
match
a
somewhat
standing
collar
flaring
away
from
the
throat
was
encircled
by
a
red
cravat
tied
in
a
bow
under
his
chin
a
diamond
stud
of
perhaps
two
carats
showed
in
the
triangle
of
spotless
shirt
front
and
on
his
head
was
a
cloth
cap
with
ear
lappets
he
accosted
our
friend
with
i
reckon
you
must
be
lenox
how
are
you
i
glad
to
see
you
tugging
off
a
thick
buckskin
glove
and
putting
out
a
plump
but
muscular
hand
john
thanked
him
as
they
shook
hands
and
hoped
he
was
well
said
harum
i
improvin
slowly
i
got
so
i
set
up
long
enough
to
have
my
bed
made
come
last
night
i
anybody
to
the
deepo
to
bring
ye
over
this
time
o
year
once
a
while
the
do
nobody
go
over
for
passengers
john
said
that
he
had
had
no
trouble
a
man
by
the
name
of
robinson
had
brought
him
and
his
luggage
said
david
with
a
nod
backing
up
to
the
fire
which
was
burning
in
the
grate
of
the
franklin
stove
robinson
he
do
the
thing
in
the
matter
of
questions
an
conversation
he
asked
with
a
grin
john
laughed
in
reply
to
this
question
where
you
put
up
asked
david
john
said
that
he
passed
the
night
at
the
eagle
hotel
harum
had
seen
dick
larrabee
that
morning
and
heard
what
he
had
to
say
of
our
friend
reception
but
he
liked
to
get
his
information
from
original
sources
make
ye
putty
he
asked
turning
to
eject
a
mouthful
into
the
fire
i
got
along
pretty
well
under
the
circumstances
said
john
harum
did
not
press
the
inquiry
how
you
leave
the
he
inquired
he
seemed
to
be
well
replied
john
and
he
wished
to
be
kindly
remembered
to
you
fine
man
the
declared
david
well
pleased
fine
man
all
word
as
good
as
his
bond
yes
sir
when

gives
his
warrant
i
do
care
whether
i
see
the
critter
or
not
know
him
much
he
and
my
father
were
old
friends
and
i
have
known
him
a
good
many
years
replied
john
adding
he
has
been
very
kind
and
friendly
to
me
set
down
set
down
said
harum
pointing
to
a
chair
seating
himself
he
took
off
his
cap
and
dropped
it
with
his
gloves
on
the
floor
how
long
you
ben
here
in
the
office
he
asked
perhaps
half
an
hour
was
the
reply
i
meant
to
have
ben
here
when
you
come
said
the
banker
but
i
got
hendered
about
a
matter
of
a
hoss
i
looking
at
i
guess
i
shut
that
door
making
a
move
toward
the
one
into
the
front
office
allow
me
said
john
getting
up
and
closing
it
may
well
shut
the
other
one
while
you
about
it
thank
you
as
john
resumed
his
seat
i
hai
got
nothin
very
private
but
of
distractin
timson
mind
did
he
himself
yes
said
john
we
introduced
ourselves
and
had
a
few
minutes
conversation
gin
ye
his
hull
an
a
few
relations
throwed
in
there
was
hardly
time
for
that
said
john
smiling
rubbed
a
little
polish
into
my
an
repitation
insinuated
harum
most
of
our
talk
was
on
the
subject
of
his
duties
and
responsibilities
was
john
reply
do
to
let
on
any
he
to
thought
david
to
himself
allowed
he
run
the
hull
shebang
did
he
he
seemed
to
have
a
pretty
large
idea
of
what
was
required
of
one
in
his
place
admitted
the
witness
kind
o
friendly
was
he
asked
david
well
said
john
after
we
had
talked
for
a
while
i
said
to
him
that
i
was
glad
to
think
that
he
could
have
no
unpleasant
feeling
toward
me
seeing
that
he
had
given
up
the
place
of
his
own
preference
and
he
assured
me
that
he
had
none
david
turned
and
looked
at
john
for
an
instant
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
younger
man
returned
the
look
and
smiled
slightly
david
laughed
outright
i
guess
you
seen
folks
before
he
remarked
i
have
never
met
any
one
exactly
like
timson
i
think
said
our
friend
with
a
slight
laugh
fortunitly
them
kind
is
rare
observed
harum
dryly
rising
and
going
to
his
desk
from
a
drawer
of
which
he
produced
a
couple
of
cigars
one
of
which
he
proffered
to
john
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
during
the
next
half
hour
regretted
that
he
was
a
smoker
david
sat
for
two
or
three
minutes
puffing
diligently
and
then
took
the
weed
out
of
his
mouth
and
looked
contemplatively
at
it
how
do
you
like
that
cigar
he
inquired
it
burns
very
nicely
said
the
victim
harum
emitted
a
cough
which
was
like
a
chuckle
or
a
chuckle
which
was
like
a
cough
and
relapsed
into
silence
again
presently
he
turned
his
head
looked
curiously
at
the
young
man
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
his
glance
again
to
the
fire
i
ben
wonderin
some
he
said
since
i
see
you
how
was
you
wanted
to
come
up
here
to
homeville
wolsey
gin
his
warrant
an
so
i
reckon
you
had
ben
gettin
into
no
scrape
nor
nothin
and
again
he
looked
sharply
at
the
young
man
at
his
side
did
the
general
say
nothing
of
my
affairs
the
latter
asked
no
replied
david
all
he
said
was
in
a
way
that
knowed
you
an
your
folks
a
good
while
an
he
thought
you
be
jest
the
feller
i
was
lookin
fer
mebbe
he
reckoned
that
if
you
wanted
your
story
told
you
ruther
tell
it
yourself
chapter
xiv
whatever
might
have
been
john
repugnance
to
making
a
confidant
of
the
man
whom
he
had
known
but
for
half
an
hour
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
the
other
curiosity
was
not
only
natural
but
proper
he
could
not
but
know
that
in
appearance
and
manner
he
was
in
marked
contrast
with
those
whom
the
man
had
so
far
seen
he
divined
the
fact
that
his
coming
from
a
great
city
to
settle
down
in
a
village
town
would
furnish
matter
for
surprise
and
conjecture
and
felt
that
it
would
be
to
his
advantage
with
the
man
who
was
to
be
his
employer
that
he
should
be
perfectly
and
obviously
frank
upon
all
matters
of
his
own
which
might
be
properly
mentioned
he
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
harum
combined
acuteness
and
suspiciousness
to
a
very
large
degree
and
he
had
also
a
feeling
that
the
old
man
confidence
once
gained
would
not
be
easily
shaken
so
he
told
his
hearer
so
much
of
his
history
as
he
thought
pertinent
and
david
listened
without
interruption
or
comment
save
an
occasional
and
here
i
am
john
remarked
in
conclusion
here
you
fer
a
fact
said
david
the
worse
places
homeville
after
you
git
used
to
it
he
added
in
qualification
i
ben
back
here
a
matter
o
thirteen
or
fourteen
year
now
an
am
gettin
to
feel
my
way
putty
well
but
not
havin
ben
in
these
parts
fer
putty
nigh
thirty
year
i
found
it
ruther
lonesome
to
start
with
an
i
guess
if
it
had
ben
fer
polly
i
would
stood
it
but
up
to
the
time
i
come
back
she
had
never
ben
ten
mile
away
f
here
in
her
hull
life
an
i
could
budge
her
but
then
he
remarked
while
homeville
aint
a
it
some
a
place
f
what
it
used
to
be
in
some
polly
my
sister
he
added
by
way
of
explanation
well
said
john
with
rather
a
rueful
laugh
if
it
has
taken
you
all
that
time
to
get
used
to
it
the
outlook
for
me
is
not
very
encouraging
i
afraid
remarked
harum
i
apt
to
speak
in
sometimes
i
guess
you
git
along
after
a
spell
though
it
may
set
fust
rate
on
your
stomech
till
you
git
used
to
the
diet
say
he
said
after
a
moment
if
you
had
a
couple
o
thousan
more
do
you
think
you
stuck
to
the
law
i
sure
i
do
know
replied
john
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
not
general
wolsey
told
me
that
if
i
were
very
anxious
to
go
on
with
it
he
would
help
me
but
after
what
i
told
him
he
advised
me
to
write
to
you
he
did
did
he
yes
said
john
and
after
what
i
had
gone
through
i
was
not
altogether
sorry
to
come
away
said
harum
thoughtfully
if
i
was
to
lose
what
little
got
an
had
to
give
up
livin
in
the
way
i
was
used
to
an
even
keep
a
hoss
i
allow
i
might
be
willin
fer
a
change
of
scene
to
make
a
fresh
start
in
yes
sir
i
guess
i
would
looking
at
his
watch
i
got
to
go
now
an
i
see
ye
later
mebbe
you
feel
like
takin
holt
oh
yes
said
john
with
alacrity
all
right
said
harum
you
tell
timson
what
you
want
an
make
him
show
you
everythin
he
understands
an
i
paid
him
agreed
to
stay
any
time
in
reason
you
want
him
but
i
guess
he
added
with
a
laugh
you
pump
him
dry
a
day
or
two
it
haint
rained
wisdom
an
knowlidge
in
his
part
o
the
country
fer
a
spell
david
stood
for
a
moment
drawing
on
his
gloves
and
then
looking
at
john
with
his
characteristic
chuckle
continued
allowed
he
ben
drawin
the
hull
load
did
he
sir
the
truth
o
is
he
never
come
to
a
hill
yet
more
a
foot
high
but
what
i
had
to
git
out
an
push
nor
never
struck
a
turn
in
the
road
but
what
i
had
to
take
him
by
the
head
an
lead
him
into
it
with
which
harum
put
on
his
overcoat
and
cap
and
departed
timson
was
leaning
over
the
counter
in
animated
controversy
with
a
man
on
the
outside
who
had
evidently
asserted
or
quoted
the
quotation
is
the
usual
weapon
it
has
a
double
barb
and
can
be
wielded
with
comparative
safety
something
of
a
wounding
effect
no
sir
exclaimed
chet
with
a
sounding
slap
on
the
counter
no
sir
the
ai
one
word
o
truth
i
i
said
myself
wo
it
i
says
f
you
ner
nobody
else
i
says
what
more
says
i
the
expression
in
the
face
of
timson
tormentor
caused
that
gentleman
to
break
off
and
look
around
the
man
on
the
outside
grinned
stared
at
john
a
moment
and
went
out
and
timson
turned
and
said
as
john
came
forward
hello
the
old
man
picked
ye
to
pieces
all
he
wanted
to
we
are
through
for
the
day
i
fancy
said
our
friend
smiling
and
if
you
are
ready
to
begin
my
lessons
i
am
ready
to
take
them
harum
told
me
that
you
would
be
good
enough
to
show
me
what
was
necessary
all
right
said
timson
readily
enough
and
so
john
began
his
first
day
work
in
david
office
he
was
surprised
and
encouraged
to
find
how
much
his
experience
in
rush
company
office
stood
him
in
hand
and
managed
to
acquire
in
a
comparatively
short
time
a
pretty
fair
comprehension
of
the
system
which
prevailed
in
harum
bank
notwithstanding
the
incessant
divagations
of
his
instructor
it
was
decided
between
timson
and
our
friend
that
on
the
following
day
the
latter
should
undertake
the
office
work
under
supervision
and
the
next
morning
john
was
engaged
upon
the
preliminaries
of
the
business
when
his
employer
came
in
and
seated
himself
at
his
desk
in
the
back
room
after
a
few
minutes
in
which
he
was
busy
with
his
letters
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
front
room
he
did
not
speak
for
john
saw
him
and
responding
to
a
backward
toss
of
the
head
followed
him
into
the
parlor
and
at
an
intimation
of
the
same
silent
character
shut
the
doors
harum
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
john
stood
awaiting
his
pleasure
how
ye
make
out
yestidy
he
asked
git
anythin
out
of
old
pointing
with
his
thumb
toward
the
front
room
oh
yes
said
john
smiling
as
he
recalled
the
unceasing
flow
of
words
which
had
enveloped
timson
explanations
how
much
longer
do
you
think
you
have
to
have
him
asked
harum
well
said
john
of
course
your
customers
are
strangers
to
me
but
so
far
as
the
routine
of
the
office
is
concerned
i
think
i
can
manage
after
but
i
shall
have
to
appeal
to
you
rather
often
for
a
while
until
i
get
thoroughly
acquainted
with
my
work
good
fer
you
said
david
you
took
holt
a
good
sight
quicker
i
thought
ye
would
an
i
spend
more
or
less
time
here
fer
a
while
or
be
where
you
reach
me
it
like
this
he
continued
chet
a
helpless
kind
of
critter
fer
all
his
braggin
an
talk
an
i
ben
feelin
kind
o
wambly

of

loungers
in

the
night
of

said
david

of

dick
laughed
again
john
made
a
move
in
the
direction
of
the
front
room
hold
on
a
minute
said
david
shake
hands
with
mr
larrabee
seen
ye
before
said
dick
as
they
shook
hands
i
was
in
the
barroom
when
you
come
in
the
other
night
and
then
he
laughed
as
at
the
recollection
of
something
very
amusing
john
flushed
a
little
and
said
a
bit
stiffly
i
remember
you
were
kind
enough
to
help
about
my
luggage
excuse
me
said
dick
conscious
of
the
other
manner
i
laughin
at
you
that
is
not
in
i
could
see
your
face
when
ame
offered
ye
pie
an
doughnuts
instid
of
beefsteak
an
fixins
i
c
only
guess
at
that
but
ame
face
was
enough
fer
me
and
dick
went
off
into
another
cachinnation
david
face
indicated
some
annoyance
oh
shet
up
he
exclaimed
you
keep
that
yawp
o
goin
i
believe
if
it
was
the
judgment
day
said
dick
with
a
grin
i
expect
the
might
be
some
fun
to
be
got
out
o
if
a
feller
worryin
too
much
about
his
own
skin
an
as
fur
i
concerned
dick
further
views
on
the
subject
of
that
momentous
occasion
were
left
unexplained
a
significant
look
in
david
face
caused
the
speaker
to
break
off
and
turn
toward
the
door
through
which
came
two
men
the
foremost
a
hulking
shambling
fellow
with
an
expression
of
repellent
sullenness
he
came
forward
to
within
about
ten
feet
of
david
desk
while
his
companion
halted
near
the
door
david
eyed
him
in
silence
i
got
this
here
notice
this
mornin
said
the
man
sayin
my
note
be
due
an
have
to
be
paid
said
david
with
his
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
his
left
hand
resting
on
his
desk
that
so
ai
it
mebbe
so
was
the
fellow
reply
fur
the
comin
due
concerned
but
the
payin
part
another
matter
was
you
to
have
it
renewed
asked
david
leaning
a
little
forward
no
said
the
man
coolly
i
do
know
i
want
to
renew
it
fer
any
time
an
i
guess
it
run
along
fer
a
while
jest
as
is
john
looked
at
dick
larrabee
he
was
watching
david
face
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
enjoyment
david
twisted
his
chair
a
little
more
to
the
right
and
out
from
the
desk
you
think
it
run
along
do
ye
he
asked
suavely
i
glad
to
have
your
views
on
the
subject
i
guess
it
kin
too
until
at
four
an
after
that
you
settle
with
lawyer
johnson
or
the
sheriff
the
man
uttered
a
disdainful
laugh
i
guess
it
puzzle
ye
some
to
it
he
said
harum
bushy
red
eyebrows
met
above
his
nose
look
here
bill
montaig
he
said
i
know
more
this
matter
you
think
for
i
know
you
ben
makin
your
brags
that
you
fix
me
in
this
deal
you
allowed
that
you
set
up
usury
in
the
fust
place
an
if
that
did
work
i
find
you
was
execution
proof
anyways
that
so
ai
it
that
about
the
size
o
said
montaig
putting
his
feet
a
little
farther
apart
david
had
risen
from
his
chair
you
did
talk
that
way
proceeded
the
latter
when
you
come
here
to
git
that
money
in
the
fust
place
an
as
i
reckon
some
the
facts
in
the
case
has
slipped
out
o
your
mind
since
that
time
i
guess
i
better
jog
your
a
little
it
was
plain
from
the
expression
of
montaig
countenance
that
his
confidence
in
the
strength
of
his
position
was
not
quite
so
assured
as
at
first
but
he
maintained
his
attitude
as
well
as
in
him
lay
in
the
fust
place
david
began
his
assault
did
ye
the
money
i
it
for
ye
on
my
indorsement
an
charged
ye
fer
it
as
i
told
ye
at
the
time
an
another
thing
that
you
appear
to
forgit
is
that
you
signed
a
paper
statin
that
you
was
wuth
in
good
and
available
free
an
clear
over
five
hunderd
dollars
an
that
the
statement
was
made
to
me
with
the
view
of
havin
me
indorse
your
note
fer
that
david
smiled
grimly
at
the
look
of
disconcert
which
in
spite
of
himself
appeared
in
bill
face
i
do
remember
signin
no
paper
he
said
doggedly
jest
as
like
as
not
remarked
harum
what
was
thinkin
of
about
that
time
was
gittin
that
i
like
to
see
that
paper
said
bill
with
a
pretence
of
incredulity
you
see
it
when
the
time
comes
asserted
david
with
an
emphatic
nod
he
squared
himself
planting
his
feet
apart
and
thrusting
his
hands
deep
in
his
coat
pockets
faced
the
discomfited
yokel
do
you
think
bill
montaig
he
said
with
measureless
contempt
that
i
did
know
who
i
was
dealin
with
that
i
did
know
what
a
skunk
you
was
an
did
know
how
to
protect
myself
agin
such
as
you
be
i
did
an
do
you
stop
thinkin
it
an
he
added
shaking
his
finger
at
the
object
of
his
scorn
pay
that
or
i
put
ye
where
the
dogs
bite
ye
and
with
that
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
resumed
his
seat
bill
stood
for
a
minute
with
a
scowl
of
rage
and
defeat
in
his
lowering
face
got
any
further
with
me
inquired
harum
anythin
more
i
oblige
ye
about
there
was
no
answer
i
asked
you
said
david
raising
his
voice
and
rising
to
his
feet
if
you
had
any
further
with
me
i
dunno
i
have
was
the
sullen
response
all
right
said
david
that
bein
the
case
an
as
i
got
to
do
beside
wastin
my
time
on
such
wuthless
pups
as
you
be
i
thank
you
to
git
out
there
the
door
he
added
pointing
to
it
he
he
he
he
ho
ho
ha
came
from
the
throat
of
dick
larrabee
this
was
too
much
for
the
exasperated
bill
and
he
erred
to
put
it
mildly
in
raising
his
arm
and
advancing
a
step
toward
his
creditor
he
was
not
swift
enough
to
take
the
second
however
for
david
with
amazing
quickness
sprang
upon
him
and
twisting
him
around
rushed
him
out
of
the
door
down
the
passage
and
out
of
the
front
door
which
was
obligingly
held
open
by
an
outgoing
client
who
took
in
the
situation
and
gave
precedence
to
montaig
his
companion
who
so
far
had
taken
no
part
made
a
motion
to
interfere
but
john
who
stood
nearest
to
him
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
jerked
him
back
with
the
suggestion
that
it
would
be
better
to
let
the
two
have
it
out
by
themselves
david
came
back
rather
breathless
and
very
red
in
the
face
but
evidently
in
exceeding
good
humor
scat
my
he
exclaimed
hai
had
such
a
good
tussle
i
dunno
when
bill
considered
ruther
an
customer
remarked
dick
i
guess
he
hai
had
no
such
handlin
fer
quite
a
while
sho
exclaimed
harum
the
ai
nothin
to
him
but
wind
meanness

that
feller

fer
a
witness

i
reckon

seen
all
he
wanted
to
i
bet
neck
achin
some
added
larrabee
with
a
laugh
how
that
asked
david
well
he
made
a
move
to
tackle
you
as
you
was
escortin
bill
out
lenox
there
caught
him
in
the
collar
an
gin
him
a
jerk
that
landed
him
on
his
back
said
dick
if
turning
to
john

of
him

putty
nigh
broke
his
neck
he
went
off

he
he

make
sure

force
than

said
billy
williams
pupil
but
there
was
much
time
to
calculate
much
obliged
said
david
with
a
nod
not
at
all
protested
john
laughing
i
have
enjoyed
a
great
deal
this
morning

ben
ruther
pleasant
remarked
david
with
a
chuckle
but
you

john
went
into
the
business
office
leaving
the
banker

dick
say
said
the

when
they
were

he
exclaimed
slapping
his
thigh
and
shaking
with
laughter
the
hull
thing
any
show
i
seen
lately
and
then
for
a
while
they
fell
to
talking
of
the
sorril
colt
and
other
things
chapter
xv
when
john
went
back
to
the
office
after
the
noonday
intermission
it
was
manifest
that
something
had
happened
to
timson
and
that
the
something
was
of
a
nature
extremely
gratifying
to
that
worthy
gentleman
he
was
beaming
with
satisfaction
and
rustling
with
importance
several
times
during
the
afternoon
he
appeared
to
be
on
the
point
of
confiding
his
news
but
in
the
face
of
the
interruptions
which
occurred
or
which
he
feared
might
check
the
flow
of
his
communication
he
managed
to
restrain
himself
till
after
the
closing
of
the
office
but
scarcely
were
the
shutters
up
at
the
willing
hands
of
peleg
hopkins
when
he
turned
to
john
and
looking
at
him
sharply
said
has
dave
said
anythin
my
leavin
he
told
me
he
expected
you
would
stay
as
long
as
might
be
necessary
to
get
me
well
started
said
john
mindful
of
injunction
jest
like
him
declared
chet
jest
like
him
for
all
the
world
but

fact
o
the
matter
is

he
thought
reflected
timson
thet
he
ruther

than
to

then

chet
encouragingly

you

john
and

timson
with

man
that

kind
work
an
i
ai
meanin
any
disrispect

said
john
i
quite
understand
nobody

expect

just
the
place
with

that
you

filled
and
by
the
way
he
added
as
you
are
going
in
the
morning
and
i
may
not
see
you
again
would
you
kindly
give
me
the
last
balance
sheets
of
the
two
ledgers
and
the
i
suppose

first
of
the
month
and
i
shall
want
to
have
them
oh

mornin
my
train
do
go
till

an
i
see

on
account
of
a
lot
of
things
you
shut
up
ca
ye
whereupon
timson
made
his
exit
and
not
long
afterward
david
came
in
by
that
time
everything
had
been
put
away
the
safe
and
vault
closed
and
peleg
had
departed
with
the
mail
and
his
freedom
for
the
rest
of
the
day
said
harum
lifting
himself
to
a
seat
on
the
counter
how
you
made
out
all

replied
john
i
think
so
where
chet
he
went
away
some
few
minutes
ago
he
said
he
had
a
good
many
things
to
attend
to
as
he
was
leaving
in
the
morning
said
david
incredulously
i
guess

him
long
to
close
up
his
matters

he
leave
in
good
shape

all
right
an
so
on

john

cash

asked
him
to

me
have
the
balance
sheets
and
he
said
that
you
must
have
them
but
that
he
would
come
in
in
the
morning
and
well
what
he
said
was
that

in
the
morning
and
as

david

you
up
to
now
she
asked
but
she
got
no
answer
but
a
laugh
from
a
social
point
of
view
the
entertainment
could
not
be
described
as
a
very
brilliant
success
our
friend
was
tired
and
hungry
harum
was
unusually
taciturn
and
bixbee
being
under
her
brother
interdict
as
regarded
the
subject
which
had
it
been
allowed
discussion
might
have
opened
the
way
was
at
a
loss
for
generalities
but
john
afterward
got
upon
terms
of
the
friendliest
nature
with
that
kindly
soul
chapter
xvi
some
weeks
after
john
assumption
of
his
duties
in
the
office
of
david
harum
banker
that
gentleman
sat
reading
his
new
york
paper
in
the
wing
after
tea
and
aunt
polly
was
occupied
with
the
hemming
of
a
towel
the
able
editorial
which
david
was
perusing
was
strengthening
his
conviction
that
all
the
intelligence
and
virtue
of
the
country
were
monopolized
by
the
republican
party
when
his
meditations
were
broken
in
upon
by
bixbee
who
knew
nothing
and
cared
less
about
the
force
bill
or
the
doctrine
of
protection
to
american
industries
you
hai
said
nothin
fer
quite
a
while
about
the
bank
she
remarked
is
lenox
gittin
along
all
right
guess
he
gittin
into
condition
as
fast
as
c
be
expected
said
david
between
two
lines
of
his
editorial
it
must
be
awful
lonesome
fer
him
she
observed
to
which
there
was
no
reply
ai
it
she
asked
after
an
interval
ai
what
said
david
looking
up
at
her
awful
lonesome
she
reiterated
guess
nobody
ai
ever
very
lonesome
when
you
an
got
your
breath
was
the
reply
what
you
talkin
about
i
ai
talkin
about
you
any
rate
said
bixbee
i
was
sayin
it
must
be
awful
lonesome
fer
lenox
up
here
where
he
know
a
soul
hardly
an
livin
at
that
hole
of
a
tavern
i
do
see
you
any
cause
to
complain
long
he
do
said
david
hoping
that
it
would
not
come
to
his
sister
ears
that
he
had
for
reasons
of
his
own
discouraged
any
attempt
on
john
part
to
better
his
quarters
an
he
hai
ben
very
lonesome
daytimes
i
guess
so
fur
he
ben
makin
work
fer
himself
to
kill
time
what
do
you
mean
said
david
we
found
that
chet
had
done
more
to
give
matters
a
lick
an
a
promise
in
most
a
year
he
done
just
enough
to
keep
up
the
day
work
an
no
more
an
the
upshot
o
is
that
john
had
to
put
in
time
to
git
things
straightened
out
what
a
shame
exclaimed
aunt
polly
keeps
him
f
bein
lonesome
remarked
her
brother
with
a
grin
an
he
hai
had
no
time
to
himself
she
protested
i
do
believe
you
made
up
your
mind
yet
whether
you
goin
to
like
him
an
i
do
believe
he
anyway
i
told
more
times
said
harum
looking
up
over
his
paper
that
i
thought
we
was
goin
to
make
a
hitch
of
it
an
he
hai
said
nuthin
leavin
an
i
guess
he
wo
fer
a
while
tavern
or
no
tavern
he
got
a
putty
stiff
upper
lip
of
his
own
i
reckon
david
further
remarked
with
a
short
laugh
causing
bixbee
to
look
up
at
him
inquiringly
which
look
the
speaker
answered
with
a
nod
saying
me
an
him
had
a
little
you
hai
had
no
hev
ye
she
asked
anxiously
we
did
have
what
ye
might
call
i
was
jest
tryin
a
little
experiment
with
him
humph
she
remarked
you
alwus
tryin
on
somebody
you
be
liable
to
git
ketched
at
it
some
day
exceptin
on
you
said
david

she
cried
you
at
me
the
hull
endurin
time
an
you
know
it
but
polly
said
david
insinuatingly
you
do
know
how

so
she
declared
with
a
sniff
and
a
toss
of
the
head
what
you
ben
up
to
with
mr
lenox
oh
nuthin
much
replied
harum
making
a
feint
of
resuming
his
reading
be
ye
goin
to
tell
me
or
air
ye
too
o
she
added
with
a
little
laugh
which
somewhat
turned
the
tables
on
her
teasing
brother
i
laid
out
to
try
an
read
this
paper
he
said
spreading
it
out
on
his
lap
but
resignedly
i
guess
ai
no
use
do
you
know
what
a
bill
is
he
asked
i
dunno
i

see
one
she
said
but

david
dryly
ejaculated
bixbee
after
a
moment
of
waiting

david
the

david
harum
cried
polly
who
though
not
quite
comprehending
some
of
the
technicalities
of
detail
was
fully
alive
to
the
turpitude
of
the
suggestion
i
hope
to
gracious
he
did
think
you
was
in
earnest
why
they
was
passed
around
would
somebody
git
stuck
with
in
the
long
run
you
know
they
would
bixbee
occasionally
surprised
her
brother
with
unexpected
penetration
but
she
seldom
got
much
recognition
of
it
i
see
by
the
paper
he
remarked
that
the
was
a
man
died
in
pheladelphy
one
day
last
week
which
piece
of
barefaced
irrelevancy
elicited
no
notice
from
bixbee
what
more
did
he
say
she
demanded
responded
harum
with
a
laugh
he
said
that
he
did
see
why
i
should
be
a
loser
by
his
mistakes
an
that
as
fur
as
the
bills
was
concerned
they
belonged
to
him
an
with
that
said
the
narrator
mister
man
gits
out
of
the
draw
an
jest
marches
into
the
back
room
an
puts
the
dum
things
int
the
fire
he
done
jest
right
declared
aunt
polly
an
you
know
it
do
ye
now
said
david
f
his
standpoint
f
his
standpoint
i
guess
he
did
an
rubbing
his
chin
with
two
fingers
of
his
left
hand
it
a
putty
dum
good
standpoint
too
i
ben
lookin
he
added
reflectively
fer
an
honest
man
fer
quite
a
number
o
years
an
i
guess
i
found
him
yes
i
guess
i
found
him
an
be
you
goin
to
let
him
lose
that
fifteen
dollars
asked
the
practical
polly
fixing
her
brother
with
her
eyes
said
david
with
a
short
laugh
what
i
do
with
such
an
critter
he
is
he
jest
backed
into
the
britchin
an
i
could
do
nothin
with
him
aunt
polly
sat
over
her
sewing
for
a
minute
or
two
without
taking
a
stitch
i
sorry
you
done
it
she
said
at
last
i
dunno
but
i
did
make
ruther
a
mess
of
it
admitted
harum
chapter
xvii
it
was
the
of
december
and
shortly
after
the
closing
hour
peleg
had
departed
and
our
friend
had
just
locked
the
vault
when
david
came
into
the
office
and
around
behind
the
counter
be
you
in
any
hurry
he
asked
john
said
he
was
not
whereupon
harum
hitched
himself
up
onto
a
high
office
stool
with
his
heels
on
the
spindle
and
leaned
sideways
upon
the
desk
while
john
stood
facing
him
with
his
left
arm
upon
the
desk
john
said
david
do
ye
know
the
widdo
cullom
no
said
john
but
i
know
who
she
is
a
tall
thin
woman
who
walks
with
a
slight
stoop
and
limp
i
noticed
her
and
asked
her
name
because
there
was
something
about
her
looks
that
attracted
my
attention
as
though
at
some
time
she
might
have
seen
better
days
that
the
party
said
david
she
has
seen
better
days
but
she
eat
an
drunk
sorro
mostly
fer
goin
on
thirty
year
an
darned
little
else
good
share
o
the
time
i
reckon
she
has
that
appearance
certainly
said
john
yes
sir
said
david
she
had
a
putty
tough
time
the
widdo
has
an
yet
he
proceeded
after
a
momentary
pause
the
was
a
time
when
the
culloms
was
some
o
the
o
this
hull
region
they
used
to
own
quarter
o
the
county
an
they
lived
in
the
big
house
up
on
the
hill
where
doc
hays
lives
now
that
was
considered
to
be
the
finest
place
anywheres
here
in
them
days
i
used
to
think
the
capitol
to
washington
must
be
somethin
like
the
cullom
house
an
that
billy
folks
used
to
call
him
billy
his
father
name
was
william
an
his
was
william
parker
an
that
billy
jest
like
not
be
president
i
changed
my
mind
some
on
the
subject
of
presidents
since
i
was
a
boy
here
harum
turned
on
his
stool
put
his
right
hand
into
his
pocket
extracted
therefrom
part
of
a
paper
of
maple
dew
and
replenished
his
left
cheek
with
an
ample
wad
of
john
took
advantage
of
the
break
to
head
off
what
he
had
reason
to
fear
might
turn
into
a
lengthy
digression
from
the
matter
in
hand
by
saying
i
beg
pardon
but
how
does
it
happen
that
cullom
is
in
such
circumstances
has
the
family
all
died
out
said
david
they
most
on
dead
all
on
in
fact
except
the
widdo
son
charley
but
as
fur
the
family
concerned
it
more
out
it
out
ye
ever
hear
of
jim
calf
jim
brought
three
or
four
veals
into
town
one
spring
to
sell
dick
larrabee
used
to
peddle
meat
them
days
dick
looked
over
an
says
here
jim
he
says
guess
you
got
a
deakin
in
that
lot
he
says
dunno
what
you
mean
says
jim
ye
do
goll
darn
ye
says
dick
ye
do
you
did
never
kill
that
calf
an
you
know
it
that
calf
died
that
what
that
calf
done
come
now
own
up
he
says
says
jim
did
it
an
it
nuther
it
jest
kind
o
john
joined
in
the
laugh
with
which
the
narrator
rewarded
his
own
effort
and
david
went
on
yes
sir
they
jest
petered
out
old
billy
billy
father
inheritid
all
the
never
done
a
stroke
of
work
in
his
life
he
had
a
collidge
education
went
to
europe
an
all
that
an
before
he
was
fifty
year
old
he
hardly
ever
come
near
the
old
place
after
he
was
growed
up
the
land
was
all
farmed
out
on
shares
his
farmers
mostly
bamboozled
him
the
hull
time
he
got
income
of
course
but
as
things
went
along
and
they
found
out
how
slack
he
was
they
kept
bitin
off
bigger
chunks
all
the
time
an
sometimes
he
did
git
even
the
core
but
all
the
time
when
he
wanted
money
an
he
wanted
it
putty
often
i
tell
ye
the
easiest
way
was
to
stick
on
a
morgidge
an
after
a
spell
it
got
so
he
have
to
give
a
morgidge
to
pay
the
on
the
other
morgidges
but
said
john
was
there
nothing
to
the
estate
but
land
oh
yes
said
david
old
billy
father
left
him
some
but
after
that
was
gone
he
went
into
the
morgidge
as
i
tell
ye
he
lived
mostly
up
to
syrchester
and
around
an
when
he
got
married
he
bought
a
place
in
syrchester
and
lived
there
till
billy
was
about
twelve
or
thirteen
year
old
an
he
was
about
fifty
by
that
time
he
got
to
the
end
of
his
rope
an
the
nothin
for
it
but
to
come
back
here
to
homeville
an
make
the
most
o
what
the
was
left
an
that
what
he
done
let
alone
that
he
did
make
the
most
o
to
any
extent
mis
cullom
his
wife
no
help
to
him
she
was
a
city
woman
an
did
take
to
the
country
no
way
but
when
she
died
it
broke
old
billy
up
wus
ever
she
peaked
an
pined
an
died
when
billy
was
about
fifteen
or
so
billy
an
the
old
man
wrastled
along
somehow
an
the
boy
went
to
collidge
fer
a
year
or
so
how
they
ever
got
along
they
did
i
dunno
the
was
a
story
that
some
relation
left
old
billy
some
money
an
i
guess
that
an
what
they
got
off
what
farms
was
left
carried
along
till
billy
was
or
so
an
then
he
up
an
got
married
that
was
the
crownin
stroke
remarked
david
she
was
one
o
the
village
girls
respectable
folks
more
ordinary
good
lookin
an
high
steppin
an
had
had
some
schoolin
but
the
old
man
was
prouder
a
an
thought
nobody
quite
good
enough
fer
billy
an
all
along
kind
o
reckoned
that
he
marry
some
money
an
git
a
new
start
but
when
he
got
married
on
the
quiet
you
know
cause
he
knowed
the
old
man
would
kick
that
killed
the
trick
an
the
old
man
into
the
bargain
it
took
the
gumption
all
out
of
him
an
he
live
a
year
sir
it
was
curious
but
i
was
told
putty
much
the
hull
village
sided
with
the
old
man
the
culloms
was
kind
o
kings
in
them
days
an
folks
so
as
they
be
now
they
thought
billy
done
wrong
though
they
did
have
to
say
the
girl
neither
an
she
very
much
respected
cullom
is
an
as
fur
i
concerned
i
alwus
guessed
she
kept
billy
goin
full
as
long
any
one
could
but
no
use
that
is
to
say
the
sure
thing
come
to
pass
he
had
a
title
to
a
good
deal
o
but
the
equity
in
most
o
if
it
had
ben
to
be
put
up
enough
to
pay
fer
the
papers
you
see
the
ai
never
ben
no
real
cash
value
in
farm
in
these
parts
the
ai
ben
hardly
a
dozen
changes
in
farm
titles
by
or
foreclosure
in
thirty
years
so
billy
did
make
no
effort
one
o
them
things
that
keeps
right
on
nights
an
sundays
he
jest
had
the
deeds
made
out
and
handed
over
when
the
time
came
to
settle
the
was
some
village
lots
though
that
was
clear
that
fetched
him
in
some
money
from
time
to
time
until
they
was
all
gone
but
one
an
that
the
one
cullom
lives
on
now
it
was
a
lot
in
fact
a
putty
sizable
place
she
thought
the
sun
rose
an
set
where
billy
was
but
she
took
a
crotchit
in
her
head
and
would
ever
sign
no
papers
fer
that
an
lucky
fer
him
too
the
was
a
house
on
to
it
an
he
had
a
roof
over
his
head
anyway
when
he
died
six
or
seven
years
after
he
married
an
left
her
with
a
boy
to
raise
how
she
got
along
all
them
years
till
charley
got
big
enough
to
help
i
swan
i
do
know
she
took
in
sewin
an
washin
an
went
out
to
cook
an
nurse
an
all
that
but
i
reckon
the
was
now
an
then
times
when
they
did
overload
their
stomechs
much
nor
have
to
open
the
winders
to
cool
off
but
she
held
onto
that
of
like
a
pup
to
a
root
it
was
putty
well
out
when
billy
died
but
the
village
has
growed
up
to
it
the
some
good
lots
could
be
cut
out
o
an
it
backs
up
to
the
river
where
the
current
enough
to
make
a
mighty
good
power
fer
a
light
i
know
some
fellers
that
are
talkin
of
startin
a
plant
here
an
it
ai
out
o
sight
that
they
pay
a
good
price
fer
the
river
front
enough
land
to
build
on
fact
o
is
it
got
to
be
a
putty
piece
o
more
she
on
i
reckon
here
harum
paused
pinching
his
chin
with
thumb
and
index
finger
and
mumbling
his
tobacco
john
who
had
listened
with
more
attention
than
interest
wondering
the
while
as
to
what
the
narrative
was
leading
up
to
thought
something
might
properly
be
expected
of
him
to
show
that
he
had
followed
it
and
said
so
cullom
has
kept
this
last
piece
clear
has
she
no
said
david
bringing
down
his
right
hand
upon
the
desk
with
emphasis
that
jest
what
she
hai
done
an
that
how
i
come
to
tell
ye
somethin
of
the
story
an
more
o
you

very
much
interested

i
got
somethin
i
want

time
an

but
that
as
fur
as
he
can
see
the
wo
take
very
long
somethin
like
that
you
understand
very
well
sir
said
john
hoping
that
his
employer
would
not
see
in
his
face
the
disgust
and
repugnance
he
felt
as
he
surmised
what
a
scheme
was
on
foot
and
recalled
what
he
had
heard
of
harum
hard
and
unscrupulous
ways
though
he
had
to
admit
that
this
excepting
perhaps
the
episode
of
the
counterfeit
money
was
the
first
revelation
to
him
personally
but
this
seemed
very
bad
to
him
all
right
said
david
cheerfully
i
it
wo
take
you
long
to
find
out
what
in
your
stockin
an
if
you

nothin
else
to

an
have
that
skeezicks
of
a
boy

up
the
fires
the
place
be
warm
very
good
sir
said
john
hoping
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
but
the
elder
man
sat
for
some
minutes
apparently
in
a
brown
study
and
occasionally
a
smile
of
sardonic
cunning
wrinkled
his
face
at
last
he
said
i
told
ye
so
much
that
i
may
as
well
tell
ye
how
i
come
by
that
morgidge
take
but
a
minute
an
then
you
can
run
an
play
he
added
with
a
chuckle
i
trust
i
have
not
betrayed
any
impatience
said
john
and
instantly
conscious
of
his
infelicitous
expression
added
hastily
i
have
really
been
very
much
interested
oh
no
was
the
reply
you
hai
none
but
i
know
old
fellers
like
me
tell
a
thing
twice
over
while
they
at
it
he
went
on
it
was
like
this
after
charley
cullom
got
to
be
some
grown
he
helped
to
keep
the
pot
they
got
on
some
better
seven
year
ago
though
he
up
an
got
married
an
then
the
fat
ketched
fire
finally
he
allowed
that
if
he
had
some
money
go
west
take
up
some
land
git
along
like
pussly
a
flower
he
ambitioned
that
if
his
mother
raise
a
thousan
dollars
on
her
place
he
be
sure
to
take
care
of
the
an
pay
off
the
in
almost
no
time
she
done
it
an
off
he
went
she
did
come
to
me
fer
the
money
because
i
dunno
at
any
rate
she
did
but
got
it
of
swinney
it
turned
out
jest
any
fool
might
predilictid
fer
after
the
first
year
when
i
reckon
he
paid
it
out
of
the
thousan
charley
never
paid
no
the
second
year
he
was
jest
gettin
goin
the
next
year
he
lost
a
hoss
jest
as
he
was
to
pay
an
the
next
year
the
grasshoppers
smote
him
so
on
an
the
outcome
was
that
at
the
end
of
five
years
when
the
morgidge
had
one
year
to
run
charley
paid
one
year
an
she
paid
one
an
she
stood
to
owe
three
years
how
old
swinney
come
to
hold
off
so
was
that
she
used
to
pay
the
cuss
ten
dollars
or
so
six
months
git
no
credit
fer
it
an
no
receipt
an
no
witniss
he
knowed
the
was
improving
all
the
time
he
may
have
had
another
reason
but
at
any
rate
he
let
her
run
and
got
the
shave
but
at
the
time
i
you
about
he
begun
to
cut
up
an
allowed
that
if
she
did
settle
up
the
he
foreclose
an
i
got

o
an
i

ye
i
reckon
i
says
of
course
i
known
that
swinney
had
a
morgidge
because
it
was
a
matter
of
record
an
i
knowed
him
well
enough
to
give
a
guess
what
his
game
was
goin
to
be
an
that
i
had
my
eye
on
that
piece
an
parcel
an
i
figured
that
he
any
likelier
a
citizen
i
was
yes
said
john
to
himself
where
the
carcase
is
the
vultures
are
gathered
together
i
says
to
her
after
we
had
a
little
more
talk
you
come
to
my
place
an
mebbe
we
cipher
this
thing
out
i
do
say
positive
that
we
kin
i
says
mebbe
mebbe
so
that
afternoon
i
sent
over
to
the
county
seat
an
got
a
description
an
had
a
second
morgidge
drawed
up
fer
two
hundred
dollars
an
mis
cullom
signed
it
mighty
quick
i
had
the
morgidge
made
one
day
after
date
as
i
said
to
her
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
loan
but
she
was
so
tickled
she
have
signed
most
at
that
time
i
says
to
her
go
an
settle
with
old
but
do
you
say
a
word
where
you
got
the
money
i
says
ye
let
on
nothin
stretch
that
conscience
if
i
says
be
if
he
asks
you
if
dave
harum
give
ye
the
money
you
jest
say
no
he
did
that
wont
be
no
lie
i
says
i
aint
it
to
ye
i
says
she
done
as
i
told
her
of
course
swinney
suspicioned
fust
off
that
i
was
mixed
up
in
it
but
she
stood
him
off
so
fair
an
square
that
he
know
jest
what
think
but
his
claws
was
cut
fer
a
spell
anyway
things
went
on
fer
a
while
till
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
ought
to
relieve
swinney
of
some
of
his
anxieties
about
worldly
i
dropped
in
on
him
one
mornin
an
passed
the
time
o
day
an
after
we
eased
up
our
minds
on
the
subjects
of
each
other
health
an
such
like
i
says
hold
a
morgidge
on
the
widder
cullom
place
ye
of
course
he
could
say
nothin
but
she
keep
up
the
all
right
i
says
do
want
to
be
pokin
my
nose
into
your
i
says
do
tell
me
nothin
you
do
want
to
he
knowed
dave
harum
was
dave
harum
an
that
he
might
well
spit
it
out
an
he
says
she
did
pay
nothin
fer
a
good
while
but
last
time
she
forked
over
the
hull
amount
i
hai
no
notion
he
says
she
come
to
time
agin
she
do
i
says
take
the
wo
ye
see
no
other
way
he
says
an
lookin
up
quick
you
me
he
says
i
says
ai
buyin
no
real
estate
jest
now
but
the
thing
i
come
in
fer
i
says
out
the
pleasure
of
havin
a
talk
with
you
was
to
say
that
i
take
that
morgidge
off
your
hands
sir
he
he
he
he
scat
my
at
that
he
looked
at
me
fer
a
minute
with
his
jaw
on
his
neck
an
then
he
hunched
himself
drawed
in
his
neck
like
a
mud
turtle
he
says
ai
sufferin
fer
the
money
an
i
guess
i
keep
the
morgidge
it
putty
near
due
now
but
mebbe
i
let
it
run
a
spell
i
guess
the
good
fer
it
i
says
reckon
you
let
it
run
long
enough
fer
the
widder
to
pay
the
taxes
o
once
more
anyhow
i
guess
the
good
enough
to
take
that
resk
but
how
i
says
mean
he
says
mean
says
i
i
got
a
second
morgidge
on
that
an
i
begin
to
tremble
fer
my
you

an
i
to
protect

my
investment
unless

not
an
you

jest
sign
that
morgidge
over
to
me
an
the
sooner
the
quicker
i
says
david
brought
his
hand
down
on
his
thigh
with
a
vigorous
slap
the
fellow
of
the
one
which
john
could
imagine
had
emphasized
his
demand
upon
swinney
the
story
to
which
he
had
at
first
listened
with
polite
patience
merely
he
had
found
more
interesting
as
it
went
on
and
excusing
himself
he
brought
up
a
stool
and
mounting
it
said
and
what
did
swinney
say
to
that
harum
emitted
a
gurgling
chuckle
yawned
his
quid
out
of
his
mouth
tossing
it
over
his
shoulder
in
the
general
direction
of
the
waste
basket
and
bit
off
the
end
of
a
cigar
which
he
found
by
slapping
his
waistcoat
pockets
john
got
down
and
fetched
him
a
match
which
he
scratched
in
the
vicinity
of
his
hip
pocket
lighted
his
cigar
john
declining
to
join
him
on
some
plausible
pretext
having
on
a
previous
occasion
accepted
one
of
the
brand
and
after
rolling
it
around
with
his
lips
and
tongue
to
the
effect
that
the
lighted
end
described
sundry
eccentric
curves
located
it
firmly
with
an
upward
angle
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
gave
it
a
couple
of
vigorous
puffs
and
replied
to
john

a
perfesser
of

some
years

said
david
as

yawning

enough
fer
one
day

any
trouble
o

the
reply

nothin

fer

i

twist
on
him
that
i

but
he
put
up
a
great
show
of
doin
it
to
obleege
me
i
thanked
him
an
so
on
an
when
we
got
through
i
ast
him
if
he
would
step
over
to
the
take
somethin
an
he
looked
kind
o
shocked
an
said
he
never
drinked
nothin
it
was
his
he
said
ho
ho
ho
ho
scat
my
and
john
heard
him
chuckling
to
himself
all
the
way
out
of
the
office
chapter
xviii
considering
john
relations
with
david
harum
it
was
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
think
as
well
of
him
as
possible
and
he
had
not
or
thought
he
had
not
allowed
his
mind
to
be
influenced
by
the
disparaging
remarks
and
insinuations
which
had
been
made
to
him
or
in
his
presence
concerning
his
employer
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
form
his
opinion
upon
his
own
experience
with
the
man
and
so
far
it
had
not
only
been
pleasant
but
favorable
and
far
from
justifying
the
talk
that
had
come
to
his
ears
it
had
been
made
manifest
to
him
it
was
true
that
david
was
capable
of
a
sharp
bargain
in
certain
lines
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
more
for
the
pleasure
of
matching
his
wits
against
another
than
for
any
gain
involved
harum
was
an
experienced
and
expert
horseman
who
delighted
above
all
things
in
dealing
in
and
trading
horses
and
john
soon
discovered
that
in
that
community
at
least
to
get
the
best
of
a
by
almost
any
means
was
considered
a
venial
sin
if
a
sin
at
all
and
the
standards
of
ordinary
business
probity
were
not
expected
to
govern
those
transactions
david
had
said
to
him
once
when
he
suspected
that
john
ideas
might
have
sustained
something
of
a
shock
a
ai
like
else
a
feller
may
be
straighter
a
string
in
else
never
tell
the
truth
that
is
the
hull
truth
about
a
hoss
i
trade
hosses
with
they
all
think
they
know
as
much
as
i
do
i
dunno
but
what
they
do
they
hai
learnt
no
anyway
they
had
chances
enough
if
a
feller
come
to
me
that
did
think
he
knowed
anythin
about
a
hoss
an
wanted
to
buy
on
the
square
he
git
fur
i
knew
square
treatment
at
any
rate
i
tell
him
all
i
knew
but
when
one
o
them
smart
alecks
comes
along
and
to
do
up
old
dave
why
he
got
to
take
his
chances
that
all
an
mind
ye
asserted
david
shaking
his
forefinger
impressively
it
ai
only
them
fellers
i
ben
wuss
stuck
two
three
time
by
church
members
in
good
standin
than
anybody
i
ever
dealed
with
take
old
deakin
perkins
a
terrible
feller
fer
church
pray
an
to
beat
the
jews
an
in
spiritual
matters
read
his
title
clear
the
hull
time
but
when
it
comes
to
you
got
to
git
up
very
early
in
the
mornin
or
he
skin
the
eyeteeth
out
of
ye
yes
sir
scat
my
i
believe
the
old
critter
hosses
but
the
deakin
added
david
he
he
he
he
the
deakin
hai
hardly
spoke
to
me
fer
some
time
the
deakin
hai
he
he
he
another
thing
he
went
on
the
ai
no
gamble
like
a
hoss
you
may
think
you
know
him
through
an
through
an
fust
thing
you
know
he
be
cuttin
up
a
lot
o
didos
right
out
o
nothin
it
stands
to
reason
that
sometimes
you
let
a
hoss
go
all
on
the
square
as
you
know
him
an
the
feller
that
gits
him
do
know
how
to
hitch
him
or
treat
him
an
he
acts
like
a
hoss
an
the
feller
allows
you
swindled
him
you
see
hosses
gits
used
to
places
an
ways
to
a
certain
extent
an
when
they
changed
why
they
apt
to
act
hosses
do
know
but
dreadful
little
really
talk
about
hoss
sense
the
ai
no
such
thing
thus
spoke
david
on
the
subject
of
his
favorite
pursuit
and
pastime
and
john
thought
then
that
he
could
understand
and
condone
some
things
he
had
seen
and
heard
at
which
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
look
askance
but
this
matter
of
the
widow
cullom
was
a
different
thing
and
as
he
realized
that
he
was
expected
to
play
a
part
though
a
small
one
in
it
his
heart
sank
within
him
that
he
had
so
far
cast
his
fortunes
upon
the
good
will
of
a
man
who
could
plan
and
carry
out
so
heartless
and
cruel
an
undertaking
as
that
which
had
been
revealed
to
him
that
afternoon
he
spent
the
evening
in
his
room
trying
to
read
but
the
widow
affairs
persistently
thrust
themselves
upon
his
thoughts
all
the
unpleasant
stories
he
had
heard
of
david
came
to
his
mind
and
he
remembered
with
misgiving
some
things
which
at
the
time
had
seemed
regular
and
right
enough
but
which
took
on
a
different
color
in
the
light
in
which
he
found
himself
recalling
them
he
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
not
decline
to
send
cullom
the
notice
as
he
had
been
instructed
and
left
it
an
open
question
when
he
went
to
bed
he
wakened
somewhat
earlier
than
usual
to
find
that
the
thermometer
had
gone
up
and
the
barometer
down
the
air
was
full
of
a
steady
downpour
half
snow
half
rain
about
the
most
disheartening
combination
which
the
worst
climate
in
the
world
that
of
central
new
york
can
furnish
he
passed
rather
a
busy
day
in
the
office
in
an
atmosphere
redolent
of
the
unsavory
odors
raised
by
the
proximity
of
wet
boots
and
garments
to
the
big
cylinder
stove
outside
the
counter
a
compound
of
stale
smells
from
kitchen
and
stable
after
the
bank
closed
he
dispatched
peleg
hopkins
the
office
boy
with
the
note
for
cullom
he
had
abandoned
his
intention
to
revolt
but
had
made
the
note
not
only
as
little
peremptory
as
was
compatible
with
a
clear
intimation
of
its
purport
as
he
understood
it
but
had
yielded
to
a
natural
impulse
in
beginning
it
with
an
expression
of
personal
regret
a
blunder
which
cost
him
no
little
chagrin
in
the
outcome
peleg
hopkins
grumbled
audibly
when
he
was
requested
to
build
the
fires
on
christmas
day
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
if
there
war
bible
agin
workin
on
the
ort
ter
be
but
when
john
opened
the
door
of
the
bank
that
morning
he
found
the
temperature
in
comfortable
contrast
to
the
outside
air
the
weather
had
changed
again
and
a
blinding
snowstorm
accompanied
by
a
buffeting
gale
from
the
northwest
made
it
almost
impossible
to
see
a
path
and
to
keep
it
in
the
central
part
of
the
town
some
tentative
efforts
had
been
made
to
open
walks
but
these
were
apparent
only
as
slight
and
tortuous
depressions
in
the
depths
of
snow
in
the
outskirts
the
unfortunate
pedestrian
had
to
wade
to
the
knees
as
john
went
behind
the
counter
his
eye
was
at
once
caught
by
a
small
parcel
lying
on
his
desk
of
white
note
paper
tied
with
a
cotton
string
which
he
found
to
be
addressed
john
lenox
present
and
as
he
took
it
up
it
seemed
heavy
for
its
size
opening
it
he
found
a
tiny
stocking
knit
of
white
wool
to
which
was
pinned
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
legend
a
merry
christmas
from
aunt
polly
out
of
the
stocking
fell
a
packet
fastened
with
a
rubber
strap
inside
were
five
gold
pieces
and
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
was
written
a
merry
christmas
from
your
friend
david
harum
for
a
moment
john
face
burned
and
there
was
a
curious
smarting
of
the
eyelids
as
he
held
the
little
stocking
and
its
contents
in
his
hand
surely
the
hand
that
had
written
your
friend
on
that
scrap
of
paper
could
not
be
the
hand
of
an
oppressor
of
widows
and
orphans
this
said
john
to
himself
is
what
he
meant
when
supposed
it
would
take
me
long
to
find
out
what
was
in
my
stocking
the
door
opened
and
a
blast
and
whirl
of
wind
and
snow
rushed
in
ushering
the
tall
bent
form
of
the
widow
cullom
the
drive
of
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
john
vaulted
over
the
low
cash
counter
to
push
the
door
shut
again
the
poor
woman
was
white
with
snow
from
the
front
of
her
old
worsted
hood
to
the
bottom
of
her
ragged
skirt
you
are
mrs
cullom
said
john
wait
a
moment
till
i
brush
off
the
snow
and
then
come
to
the
fire
in
the
back
room
harum
will
be
in
directly
i
expect
be
i
much
late
she
asked
i
made
much
haste
i
could
it
appear
to
me
if
i
ever
see
a
blusteriner
day
i
ai
as
strong
as
i
used
to
be
seemed
as
if
i
never
would
git
here
oh
no
said
john
as
he
established
her
before
the
glowing
grate
of
the
franklin
stove
in
the
bank
parlor
not
at
all
harum
has
not
come
in
himself
yet
shall
you
mind
if
i
excuse
myself
a
moment
while
you
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
possible
she
did
not
apparently
hear
him
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
with
cold
and
fatigue
and
nervous
excitement
her
dress
was
soaked
to
the
knees
and
as
she
sat
down
and
put
up
her
feet
to
the
fire
john
saw
a
bit
of
a
thin
cotton
stocking
and
her
deplorable
shoes
almost
in
a
state
of
pulp
a
path
led
from
the
back
door
of
the
office
to
house
and
john
snatched
his
hat
and
started
for
it
on
a
run
as
he
stamped
off
some
of
the
snow
on
the
veranda
the
door
was
opened
for
him
by
bixbee
lord
sakes
she
exclaimed
what
on
earth
be
you
cavortin
for
such
a
mornin
this
without
no
overcoat
an
on
a
dead
run
what
the
matter
nothing
serious
he
answered
but
i
in
a
great
hurry
old
cullom
has
walked
up
from
her
house
to
the
office
and
she
is
wet
through
and
almost
perished
i
thought
you
send
her
some
dry
shoes
and
stockings
and
an
old
shawl
or
blanket
to
keep
her
wet
skirt
off
her
knees
and
a
drop
of
whisky
or
something
she
all
of
a
tremble
and
i
afraid
she
will
have
a
chill
certain
certain
said
the
kind
creature
and
she
bustled
out
of
the
room
returning
in
a
minute
or
two
with
an
armful
of
comforts
a
pair
of
bedroom
slips
lined
with
lamb
wool
an
a
pair
of
woolen
stockin
an
a
blanket
shawl
this
here
petticut
ai
what
call
bran
new
but
it
warm
and
an
i
do
believe
got
much
of
anythin
on
her
dress
an
i
git
ye
the
whisky
but
here
she
looked
deprecatingly
at
john
it
ai
known
we
keep
the
stuff
in
the
house
i
do
know
as
it
right
but
though
david
do
hardly
ever
touch
it
he
will
have
it
in
the
house
oh
said
john
laughing
you
may
trust
my
discretion
and
we
swear
cullom
to
secrecy
all
right
said
bixbee
joining
in
the
laugh
as
she
brought
the
bottle
jest
a
minute
till
i
make
a
passel
of
the
things
to
keep
the
snow
out
there
now
i
guess

an
you

ketches
a
chill
thanks

much
said
john
as
he
started
away
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
besides
christmas
but
i
must
wait
till
another
time
when
john
got
back
to
the
office

had
just
preceded
him
he
was
saying
but

front
room
while

exclaimed
harum
as
they
stood
leaning
against
the
teller
counter
facing
the
street
i
did
to
have
cullom
hoof
it
up
here
the
way
she
done
when
i
see
what
kind
of
a
day
it
was
i
went
out
to
the
barn
to
have
the
cutter
hitched
an
send
for
her
an
i
found
that
dum
uneasy
sorril
colt
had
got
cast
in
the
stall
an
i
ben
fussin
with
him
ever
since
i
clean
forgot
all
mis

till
jest
now
is
the
colt
much
injured
john
asked
he
wo
trot
a
twenty
gait
in
some
time
i
reckon
replied
david
he
wrenched
his
shoulder
some
an
mebbe
strained
his
inside
do
seem
to
take
no
in
his
feed
an
that
a
bad
sign
consarn
a
hoss
anyhow
if
they
wuth
anythin
they
more
bother
a
teethin
baby
alwus
some
dum
thing
ailin
an
i
took
stock
in
that
colt
too
he
added
regretfully
an
i
could
got
putty
near
what
i
was
askin
fer
him
last
week
an
putty
near
what
he
was
wuth
an
i
noticed
that
most
alwus
when
i
let
a
good
offer
go
like
that
some
cussed
thing
happens
to
the
hoss
it
ai
a
bad
idee
in
the
hoss
anyway
to
be
willin
to
let
the
other
feller
make
a
dollar
once
a
while
after
that
aphorism
they
waited
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
david
called
out
over
his
shoulder
how
be
you
gettin
along
cullom
i
guess
i
fixed
she
answered
and
david
walked
slowly
back
into
the
parlor
leaving
john
in
the
front
office
he
was
annoyed
to
realize
that
in
the
bustle
over
cullom
and
what
followed
he
had
forgotten
to
acknowledge
the
christmas
gift
but
hoping
that
harum
had
been
equally
oblivious
promised
himself
to
repair
the
omission
later
on
he
would
have
preferred
to
go
out
and
leave
the
two
to
settle
their
affair
without
witness
or
hearer
but
his
employer
who
as
he
had
found
usually
had
a
reason
for
his
actions
had
explicitly
requested
him
to
remain
and
he
had
no
choice
he
perched
himself
upon
one
of
the
office
stools
and
composed
himself
to
await
the
conclusion
of
the
affair
chapter
xix
cullom
was
sitting
at
one
corner
of
the
fire
and
david
drew
a
chair
opposite
to
her
feelin
all
right
now
whisky
hai
made
ye
liable
to
no
disorderly
conduct
has
it
he
asked
with
a
laugh
yes
thank
you
was
the
reply
the
warm
things
are
real
comfortin
i
guess
i
hai
had
licker
enough
to
make
me
want
to
throw
things
you
got
a
kind
streak
in
ye
dave
harum
if
you
did
send
me
this
here
note
but
i
ye
know
your
own
she
added
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
i
ben
fearin
fer
a
good
while
i
could
hold
on
that
an
i
do
know
but
what
you
might
well
git
it
as
swinney
though
i
ben
hopin
hope
that
charley
be
able
to
do
more
he
has
let
see
the
note
said
david
curtly
h
humph
to
say
that
i
have
been
instructed
by
harum
to
clear
his
own
skirts
anyway
be
closed
up
without
further
delay
john
eye
caught
the
little
white
stocking
which
still
lay
on
his
desk
yes
that
about
what
i
told
lenox
to
say
the
part
concerned
i
might
done
my
own
regrettin
if
wrote
the
note
myself
john
said
something
to
himself
ai
the
pleasantest
thing
in
the
world
fer
ye
i
allow
but
then
you
see
is
john
heard
david
clear
his
throat
and
there
was
a
hiss
in
the
open
fire
cullom
was
silent
and
david
resumed
you
see
mis
cullom
it
like
this
i
ben
thinkin
of
this
matter
fer
a
good
while
that
place
ai
ben
no
real
good
to
ye
sence
the
first
year
you
signed
that
morgidge
you
hai
scurcely
made
ends
meet
let
alone
the
an
it
ben
simply
a
question
o
time
an
who
git
the
in
the
long
run
fer
some
years
i
reckoned
same
as
you
did
that
charley
mebbe
come
to
the
front
but
he
done
it
an
ai
likely
he
ever
will
charley
a
likely
boy
some
ways
but
he
hai
got
much
there
in
his
not
enough
fer
one
anyhow
i
reckon
that
about
the
size
o
ai
it
cullom
murmured
a
feeble
admission
that
she
was
it
was
resumed
harum
i
see
how
things
was
goin
an
i
see
that
unless
i
played
euchre
swinney
git
that
an
whether
i
wanted
it
myself
or
not
i
did
he
sh
git
it
anyway
he
put
a
spoke
in
my
wheel
once
an
i
hai
forgot
it
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
after
a
short
pause
you
know
i
helped
ye
pull
the
thing
along
on
the
chance
as
ye
may
say
that
you
an
your
son
somehow
make
a
go
o
you
ben
very
kind
so
fur
said
the
widow
faintly

say
that

ye
say
that
protested
david
no
kindness
it
was
jest
i
takin
no
chances

fifty
acres
an

a
small
shop
where
he
done
odd
times
small
jobs
of
tinkerin
fer
the
neighbors
when
the
was
anythin
to
do
my
mother
was
his
second
an
i
was
the
only

me
a
decent
word
small
farmin
ai
to
fetch
out
the
best
traits
of
human
nature
an
keep
out
an
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
that
when
the
old
man
cuffin
my
ears
he
was
lickin
me
with
a
rawhide
or
a
strap
fur
that
was
concerned
all
his
boys
used
to
ketch
it
putty
till
they
got
too
big
one
on
up
an
licked
him
one
night
an
lit
out
next
day
i
the
old
man
disposition
was
by
what
some
feller
said
farmin
was
all
day
an
doin
chores
all
night
an
larrupin
me
an
all
the
rest
on
us
was
about
all
the
enjoyment
he
got
my
brothers
sisters
of
polly
was
putty
nigh
as
bad
in
respect
of
cuffs
an
such
like
an
my
was
on
the
hull
the
wust
of
all
she
had
no
childern
o
her
own
an
it
appeared
if
i
was
jest
pizen
to
her
so
much
slappin
an
cuffin
with
her
as
was
tongue
she
c
say
things
that
jest
raise
a
blister
like
pizen
ivy
i
i
about
as
freckled
little
cuss
as
you
ever
see
an
slinkin
in
my
manners
the
air
of
our
home
circle
to
raise
heroes
in
i
got
three
four
years
schoolin
an
made
out
to
read
an
write
cipher
up
to
long
division
i
got
through
but
after
i
got
to
be
six
year
old
school
or
no
school
i
had
to
work
at
anything
i
had
strength
fer
an
more
too
chores
before
school
an
after
school
an
a
walk
to
git
there
as
fur
was
concerned
any
old
thing
that
hang
together
was
good
enough
fer
me
but
by
the
time
the
older
boys
had
outgrowed
their
duds
an
they
was
passed
on
to
me
the
much
left
on
a
pair
of
old
cowhide
boots
that
leaked
in
more
snow
an
water
they
kept
out
an
a
couple
pairs
of
woolen
socks
that
was
putty
much
all
darns
was
expected
to
see
me
through
the
winter
an
i
went
barefoot
f
the
time
the
snow
was
off
the
ground
till
it
flew
agin
in
the
fall
the
but
two
seasons
o
the
year
with
me
them
of
chilblains
an
the
speaker
paused
and
stared
for
a
moment
into
the
comfortable
glow
of
the
fire
and
then
discovering
to
his
apparent
surprise
that
his
cigar
had
gone
out
lighted
it
from
a
coal
picked
out
with
the
tongs
farmin
a
hard
life
remarked
cullom
with
an
air
of
being
expected
to
make
some
contribution
to
the
conversation
an
yit
as
it
seems
to
me
as
i
look
back
o
david
resumed
pensively
the
wust
o
was
that
nobody
ever
gin
me
a
kind
word
polly
i
i
got
kind
o
used
to
bein
cold
an
tired
dressin
in
a
snowdrift
where
it
blowed
into
the
attic
an
goin
out
to
fodder
cattle
pickin
up
stun
in
the
blazin
sun
an
doin
all
the
odd
jobs
my
father
set
me
to
an
the
older
ones
shirked
onto
me
that
was
the
order
o
things
but
i
remember
i
never
git
used
to
never
pleasin
nobody
i
did
expect
nothin
f
my
an
the
only
way
i
ever
knowed
i
done
my
stent
fur
father
was
concerned
was
that
he
did
say
nothin
but
sometimes
the
older
ones
git
settin
talkin
an
laughin
havin
pop
corn
an
apples
an
that
an
i
kind
o
sidle
up
wantin
to
join
some
on
say
doin
here
time
you
was
in
bed
give
me
a
shove
or
a
cuff
yes
looking
up
at
cullom
the
wust
o
was
that
i
was
kind
o
scairt
the
hull
time
once
in
a
while
polly
give
me
a
mossel
o
comfort
but
polly
but
little
older
me
an
bein
the
youngest
girl
was
chored
most
to
death
herself
it
had
stopped
snowing
and
though
the
wind
still
came
in
gusty
blasts
whirling
the
drift
against
the
windows
a
wintry
gleam
of
sunshine
came
in
and
touched
the
widow
wrinkled
face
it
amazin
how
much
trouble
an
sorrer
the
is
in
the
world
an
how
soon
it
begins
she
remarked
moving
a
little
to
avoid
the
sunlight
i
hai
never
ben
able
to
reconcile
how
many
good
things
the
be
an
how
little
most
on
us
gits
o
them
i
hai
ben
to
meetin
fer
a
long
spell
i
hai
had
no
fit
but
i
remember
most
of
the
i
set
under
either
dwelt
on
the
wrath
to
come
or
else
on
the
doin
all
things
well
an
providin
i
hope
i
ai
no
wickeder
than
the
run
but
it
putty
hard
to
hev
faith
in
the
providin
when
you
hai
got
nothin
in
the
house
but
corn
meal
none
too
much
o
that
that
so
mis
cullom
that
so
affirmed
david
i
do
blame
ye
a
mite
assail
an
oft
prevail
as
the
says
an
i
reckon
it
a
sight
easier
to
have
faith
on
meat
an
potatoes
it
is
on
corn
meal
mush
as
i
was
sayin
i
hope
i
ai
tirin
ye
with
my
goin
on
no
said
cullom
i
engaged
to
hear
ye
but
nobody
suppose
to
see
ye
now
that
ye
was
such
a
little
critter
as
you
make
out
it
jest
as
i
tellin
ye
an
more
also
as
the
bible
says
returned
david
and
then
rather
more
impressively
as
if
he
were
leading
up
to
his
conclusion
it
come
along
to
a
time
when
i
was
thirteen
an
fourteen
the
was
a
cirkis
billed
to
show
down
here
in
homeville
an
barn
an
shed
fer
miles
around
had
pictures
stuck
onto
of
an
rhinoceroses
an
animul
that
went
into
the
ark
an
girls
ridin
bareback
an
jumpin
through
hoops
fellers
ridin
bareback
an
turnin
summersets
an
doin
turnovers
on
swings
an
clowns
gettin
an
kind
of
a
thing
that
could
be
pictered
out
an
how
the
was
to
be
a
grand
percession
at
ten
golden
chariots
an
scripteral
allegories
an
the
hull
an
the
gran
performance
at
two
admission
cents
children
under
twelve
at
cetery
an
so
forth
i
no
more
idee
o
goin
to
that
cirkis
i
had
o
flyin
to
the
moon
but
the
night
before
the
show
somethin
waked
me
twelve
i
do
know
how
was
i
ben
helpin
mend
fence
all
day
an
i
never
knowed
nothin
after
my
head
struck
the
bed
till
mornin
but
that
night
anyhow
somethin
waked
me
an
i
went
an
looked
out

windo
an
there
was
the
hull
thing
goin
by
the
house
the
was
more
or
less
moon
an
i
see
the
an
the
big
wagins
the
drivers
kind
o
noddin
over
the
dashboards
an
the
chariots
with
canvas
covers
i
do
know
how
many
of
an
the
cages
of
the
tigers
lions
an
all
i
got
up
the
next
mornin
at
an
done
my
chores
an
after
breakfust
i
set
off
fer
the
lot
where
i
was
mendin
fence
the
was
the
farthest
off
of
any
homeville
way
an
i
had
my
dinner
in
a
tin
pail
i
need
lose
no
time
home
at

an
as
luck
would
have
it
the
nobody
with
me
that
mornin
i
got
down
to
the
lot
an
set
to

but
somehow
i
could
git
that
show
out
o
my
head
nohow
as
i
said
i
had
no
more
notion
of
goin
to
that
cirkis
i
had
of
kingdom
come
i
never
had
two
shillin
of
my
own
in

i
thought
the
uneasier
i
got
somethin
seemed
pullin
an
haulin
at
me
i
gin
in
i
allowed
i
see
that
percession
anyway
if
it
took
a
leg
an
mebbe
i
c
git
back
nobody
missin
me
any

i
take
the
chances
of
a
lickin

an
i
up
an
put
fer
the
village

them
four
mile
lively
i
tell
ye
an
the
never
hurt
me
once
when
i
got
down
to
the

it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
hull
population
of
freeland
county
was
there
i
never
seen
so
many
folks
together
in
my
life
an
fer
a

to
me
as
if

at
me
an
sayin
old
harum
boy
dave
hookey
an
i
sneaked
dreadin
somebody
give
me

any
attention
to

there
to
see

show
an
one
boy
more
or
less
no
account
putty
soon
the
percession
hove
in
sight
the
was
a
stampede
among
the
boys
an
when
it
got
by
i
run
an
ketched
up
with
it
agin
an
walked
alongside
the
tin
pail
an
all
till
they
fetched
up
inside
the
tent
then
i
went
off
to
one
side
it
must
ben
about
or
an
eat
my
dinner
i
had
a
devourin
appetite
an
thought
i
jest
walk
round
a
spell
then
light
out
fer

but
the
was
so
many
things
to
see
hear
all
the
pictures
of
fat
women
an
livin
skelitons
wild
women
of
madygasker
an
wild
men
of
borneo
an

round

necks
fellers
that

an

an
such
like

an
the
band
begun
to
play
inside
the
tent
be
i
taxin
your
patience
over
the
limit
said
david
breaking
off
in
his
story
and
addressing
cullom
more
directly
no
i
guess
not
she
replied
i
was
jest
thinkin
of
a
circus
i
went
to
once
she
added
with
an
audible
sigh
said
david
taking
a
last
farewell
of
the
end
of
his
cigar
which
he
threw
into
the
grate
mebbe
what
comin
ye
more
the
rest
o
has
i
was
standin
gawpin
to
the
band
an
watchin
the
folks
git
their
tickets
when
all
of
a
suddin
i
felt
a
twitch
at
my
hair
it
had
a
way
of
workin
out
of
the
holes
in
my
old
chip
straw
hat
an
somebody
says
to
me
sonny
what
you
thinkin
of
he
says
i
looked
up
an
who
do
you
it
was
it
was
billy
cullom
i
knowed
who
he
was
fer
i
seen
him
before
but
of
course
he
did
know
me
yes
it
was
billy
an
he
rigged
out
to
kill
the
speaker
paused
and
looked
into
the
fire
smiling
the
woman
started
forward
facing
him
and
clasping
her
hands
cried
my
husband
he
have
on
said
david
slowly
and
reminiscently
near
i
remember
he
had
on
a
blue
coat
with
flat
gilt
buttons
a
plaid
velvet
vest
an
pants
strapped
down
over
his
boots
which
was
of
shiny
leather
an
a
high
pointed
collar
an
blue
stock
with
a
pin
in
it
i
remember
wonderin
if
it
c
be
real
gold
an
a
plug
beaver
hat
at
the
description
of
each
article
of
attire
cullom
nodded
her
head
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
david
face
and
as
he
concluded
she
broke
out
breathlessly
oh
yes
oh
yes
david
he
wore
them
very
same
an
he
took
me
to
that
very
same
show
that
very
same
night
there
was
in
her
face
a
look
almost
of
awe
as
if
a
sight
of
her
past
youth
had
been
shown
to
her
from
a
coffin
neither
spoke
for
a
moment
or
two
and
it
was
the
widow
who
broke
the
silence
as
david
had
conjectured
she
was
interested
at
last
and
sat
leaning
forward
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
well
she
exclaimed
ai
ye
goin
on
what
did
he
say
to
ye
responded
david
i
tell

felt
a
twitch
at
my
hair
an
he
said

about

i
looked
up
at
him
an
looked
away

big
toe
into

dust
an
then
i
dunno

was
a
look
in

the
next
thing
to
it
lordy

cullom
as
if
to

that
look
jest
as
if
he
was
laughin
at
ye
an
laughin
at
ye
an
his
arm
around

neck
david
nodded
in
reminiscent
sympathy
and
rubbed
his
bald
poll
with
the
back
of
his
hand
interjected
the
widow
said
david
resuming
he
says
to
me
you
like
to

cirkis

with
that
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
did
want
to
go
to
that
cirkis
anythin
i
ever
wanted
to
before
nor
since
it
seems

heel
agin
the
other
instep
an
all

some
gettin
over
to
the
wagin

another
scare

mossel
said
david
simply
leaning
over
and
poking
the
fire
which
operation
kept
his
face
out
of
her
sight
and
was
prolonged
rather
unduly
finally
he
straightened
up
and
blowing
his
nose
as

a
trumpet

the
old
house
on
buxton
hill
the
had
ben
no
harums

david
rose
from
his
chair
yawned
and
stretched
himself
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
the
widow
looked
up
anxiously
into
his
face
is
that
all
she
asked

a
while
it
is
an
it
ai

on

time
he
put
his
hand
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
and
took
out
three
papers
which
he
shuffled
in
review
as
if
to
verify
their
identity
and
then
held
them
in
one
hand
tapping
them
softly
upon
the
palm
of
the
other
as
if
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
the
widow
sat
with
her
eyes
fastened
upon

papers
trembling
with
nervous
apprehension
presently
he
broke
the
silence
about

he
stood
with

aggressively
wide
apart
one
hand
in
his

pocket
and
holding
in
the
other
the
morgidge
which
he
waved
from

in
emphasis
you

of
a
i

an
what
a
poor
little
forlorn
critter

i
was
the
most
animul
that
was
ever
made
out
o

to
me
that
exceptin
of
polly
i
never

word
said
to

nor
a
day
fun
your
husband

me
the
only
time

ever
had
an
i
do
know
anythin

equaled
it
since
he
spent

on

an
he
give
me

never

to

he
repeated
mournfully
i
alwus
allowed
to
pay
some
o
that
debt
back
to
him
but
seein
i
ca
do
that
mis

assented
david
in
a
low
voice
neither

a
time
and
then
the
widow
said
david
i

i

ter
i
do

but
i
pray
for

dave
she
added
humbly
i

providin
she
sat
a
moment
lost
in
her
thoughts

dave
harum

the

her
feet
you

said
david
with
a
grin
i
do
know
much
about
the
but
i
guess
a
cloth
cap
a
hoss
whip
more
my
line
than
a
crown
an
scepter
an
now
he
added
we
got

looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
without
replying
david
took
from
his
pocket
a
large
wallet
secured
by
a
strap
and
opening
it
extracted
something
enveloped
in
much
faded
brown
paper
unfolding
this
he
displayed
upon
his
broad
fat
palm
an
old
silver
dime
black
with
age
there
the
he
said
chapter
xxi
john
walked
to
the
front
door
with
cullom
but
she
declined
with
such
evident
sincerity
his
offer
to
carry
her
bundle
to
the
house
that
he
let
her
out
of
the
office
and
returned
to
the
back
room
david
was
sitting
before
the
fire
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
he
looked
up
as
john
entered
and
said
draw
up
a
chair
john
brought
a
chair
and
stood
by
the
side
of
it
while
he
said
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
christmas
remembrance
which
pleased
and
touched
me
very
deeply
and
he
added
diffidently

to
say
how
mortified
i
am
in
fact

want
to
apologize
for
regrettin
interrupted
david
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
toward
the
chair
and
a
smile
of
great
amusement
sho

se
down

said
john
seating
himself
i

that
is
to
say
i
ought
to
have
known
how
could
ye
david
broke
in
when
i
as

as

i
was
to

the
old

a
picture
when

john
laughed
and
said

very
generous
all
through
mr
harum
nothin
to

on
he
replied
nothin
to
brag
on
fur
cullom
matter
was
concerned
was
as
i
said
jest
payin
off
an
old
score
an
as
fur
your
stockin
it
really
putty
much
the
same
i
allow

if

easier
on

stomach
i
ca
say
that
i
have
been
overworked
said
john
with
a
slight
laugh
mebbe
not
rejoined
david
but
you
hai
ben
overpaid
neither
an
i
want
ye
to
be
satisfied
fact
is
he
continued
my
gettin
you
up
here
was
putty
of
an
experiment
but
i
ben
watchin
ye
putty
close
an
i
satisfied
mebbe
timson
c
beat
ye
at
an
countin
money
when
you
fust
come
an
knowed
more
about
the
points
of
the
office
but
outside
of
that
he
was
the
biggist
i
ever
see
an
you
know
how
he
left
things
he
had
no
tack
fer
one
thing
outside
of
summin
up
figures
an
countin
money
he
had
a
faculty
fer
gettin
things
to
that
beat
all
i
tell
him
a
thing
an
explain
it
to
him
two
three
times
over
an
he
say
yes
an
scat
my
when
it
came
to
carryin
o
out
he
had
sensed
it
a
mite
jest
got
it
an
talk
i
think
it
must
ben
a
kind
of
disease
with
him
he
really
mean
no
harm
mebbe
but
he
could
no
more
help
lettin
out
he
knowed
or
thought
he
knowed
than
a
settin
hen
help
settin
he
kep
me
on
the
hull
endurin
time
i
should
say
he
was
honest
enough
was
he
not
said
john
oh
yes
replied
david
with
a
touch
of
scorn
he
was
honest
enough
fur
money
matters
was
concerned
but
he
had
no
tack
nor
no
sense
an
many
a
time
he
done
more
mischief
with
his
than
if
he
took
fifty
dollars
out
an
out
fact
is
said
david
the
kind
of
honesty
that
wo
actually
steal
a
kind
of
fool
honesty
common
enough
but
the
kind
that
keeps
a
feller
mouth
shut
when
he
had
ought
to
talk
about
the
scurcest
thing
goin
i
jest
tell
ye
fer
example
the
last
mess

made
you

david
purse

off

he
he
he
he

i
charged
him
what
i
thought

on

deal
an
he
squimmidged
some
an
i
reckon
he
allowed
to
be
putty
well
bled
if
i
took
holt
agin
but
i
done
as
i
agreed
on
the
extension
an
i
on
his
paper
for
twelve
hunderd
fer
nothin
jest
because
that
of
a
timson
let
that
drummer
bamboozle
him
into
talkin
i
found
out
the
hull
thing
an
the
very
day
i
wrote
to
the
new
york
fellers
fer
purse
i
wrote
to
wolsey
to
find
me
somebody
to
take
timson
place
i
allowed
i
ruther
have
somebody
that
did
know
nobody
than
such
a
clackin
ole
as
chet
i
should
have
said
that
it
was
rather
a
hazardous
thing
to
do
said
john
to
put
a
total
stranger
like
me
into
what
is
rather
a
confidential
position
as
well
as
a
responsible
one
said
david
in
the
fust
place
i
knew
that
the
recommend
no
nor
no
skin
an
i
allowed
that
if
the
raw
material
was
i
could
break
it
in
an
if
it
i
should
find
it
out
putty
quick
like
a
young
hoss
he
remarked
if
he
sound
kind
an
got
gumption
i
sooner
break
him
in
myself
not
fur
my
use
goes
an
if
i
ca
nobody
can
an
i
get
rid
on
him
you
understand
yes
said
john
with
a
smile
continued
david
i
liked
your
letter
an
when
you
come
i
liked
your
looks
of
course
i
could
tell
jest
how
you
take
holt
nor
if
you
an
me
hitch
an
then
agin
i
did
know
whether
you
could
stan
it
here
after
livin
in
a
city
all
your
life
i
watched
ye
putty
close
closter
you
knowed
of
i
guess
i
seen
right
off
that
you
was
goin
to
fill
your
collar
fur
the
work
was
concerned
though
you
did
know
nobody
much
an
could
have
no
amusement
to
speak
on
you
did
mope
nor
sulk
an
what
more
though
i
know
i
advised
ye
to
stay
there
fer
a
spell
longer
when
you
spoke
about
boardin
somewhere
else
i
know
what
the
eagle
tavern
is
in
winter
summer
too
fer
that
matter
though
it
a
little
better
then
an
i
allowed
that
air
test
be
final
he
he
he
putty
rough
ai
it
it
is
rather
said
john
laughing
i
afraid
my
endurance
is
pretty
well
at
an
end
elright
wife
is
ill
and
the
fact
is
that
since
day
before
yesterday
i
have
been
living
on
what
i
could
buy
at
the
grocery
crackers
cheese
salt
fish
canned
goods
scat
my
cried
david
that
too
dum
bad
why
on
earth
why
you
must
be
you
wo
have
to
eat
no
salt
herrin
because
polly
i
are
expectin
ye
to
dinner
two
or
three
times
during
the
conversation
david
had
gone
to
the
window
overlooking
his
lawn
and
looked
out
with
a
general
air
of
observing
the
weather
and
at
this
point
he
did
so
again
coming
back
to
his
seat
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
for
which
there
was
to
john
no
obvious
reason
he
sat
for
a
moment
without
speaking
and
then
looking
at
his
watch
said
dinner
at
one
an
polly
a
great
one
fer
bein
on
time
guess
i
go
out
an
have
another
look
at
that
pesky
colt
you
better
go
over
to
the
house
quarter
to
one
an
you
make
your
over
there
i
if
you
go
over
to
the
eagle
it
spoil
your
appetite
she
think
it
might
anyway
so
david
departed
to
see
the
colt
and
john
got
out
some
of
the
books
and
busied
himself
with
them
until
the
time
to
present
himself
at
david
house
chapter
xxii
why
mis
cullom
i
real
glad
to
see
ye
come
right
in
said
bixbee
as
she
drew
the
widow
into
the
wing
settin
room
and
proceeded
to
relieve
her
of
her
wraps
and
her
bundle
set
right
here
by
the
fire
while
i
take
these
things
of
into
the
kitchen
to
dry
out
i
be
right
back
and
she
bustled
out
of
the
room
when
she
came
back
cullom
was
sitting
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
there
was
in
her
eyes
an
expression
of
smiling
peace
that
was
good
to
see
bixbee
drew
up
a
chair
and
seating
herself
said
i
know
when
i
seen
ye
to
git
a
chance
to
speak
to
ye
an
i
was
real
pleased
when
david
said
you
was
goin
to
be
here
to
dinner
an
my
how
well
you
lookin
more
like
cynthy
sweetland
than
i
seen
ye
fer
i
do
know
when
an
yet
she
added
looking
curiously
at
her
guest
you
somehow
as
if
you
ben
cryin
you
real
kind
i
sure
responded
cullom
replying
to
the
other
welcome
and
remarks
i
guess
though
i
do
look
much
like
cynthy
sweetland
if
i
do
feel
twenty
years
younger
i
did
a
while
ago
an
i
have
ben
cryin
i
allow
but
not
fer
sorro
polly
harum
she
exclaimed
giving
the
other
her
maiden
name
your
brother
dave
comes
putty
nigh
to
bein
an
angel
replied
bixbee
with
a
twinkle
i
reckon
dave
might
hev
to
be
fixed
up
some
afore
he
come
out
in
that
shape
but
she
added
impressively
es
fur
as
bein
a
goes
he
good
they
make
i
know
folks
thinks
he
a
hard
bargainer
an
some
on
that
ai
fit
to
lick
up
his
tracks
says
that
he
got
his
own
ways
i
allow
but
down
at
bottom
all
through
i
know
the
ai
no
better
man
livin
no
ai
an
what
he
ben
to
me
cynthy
cullom
nobody
knows
but
me
an
an
mebbe
the
lord
though
i
hev
seen
the
time
she
said
tentatively
when
it
seemed
to
me
i
knowed
more
about
my
affairs
he
did
and
she
looked
doubtfully
at
her
companion
who
had
been
following
her
with
affirmative
and
sympathetic
nods
and
now
drew
her
chair
a
little
closer
and
said
softly
yes
yes
i
know
i
ben
putty
doubtful
an
rebellious
myself
a
good
many
times
but
seems
now
as
if
he
had
had
me
in
his
mercy
all
the
time
here
aunt
polly
sense
of
humor
asserted
itself
what
dave
ben
up
to
now
she
asked
and
then
the
widow
told
her
story
with
tears
and
smiles
and
the
keen
enjoyment
which
we
all
have
in
talking
about
ourselves
to
a
sympathetic
listener
like
aunt
polly
whose
interjections
pointed
and
illuminated
the
narrative
when
it
was
finished
she
leaned
forward
and
kissed
cullom
on
the
cheek
i
ca
tell
ye
how
glad
i
be
for
ye
she
said
but
if
i
known
that
david
held
that
morgidge
i
could
hev
told
ye
ye
need
hev
worried
yourself
a
mite
he
would
never
have
taken
your
rob
a
but
he
done
the
thing
his
own
way
kind
o
fetched
it
round
fer
a
merry
did
he
curious
she
said
reflectively
after
a
momentary
pause
how
he
lays
up
things
about
his
childhood
and
then
with
a
searching
look
at
the
widow
cullom
you
did
let
on
an
i
did
ask
ye
but
of
course
you
heard
the
things
that
some
folks
says
of
him
an
natchally
they
got
some
holt
on
your
mind
there
that
story
about

to
whitcom

about

the
widow

assentingly
bixbee

or
any
roof

a
thousan
times
too
good
fer
him
my
exclaimed
cullom
again
i
ca
really

of
dave
replied
bixbee
i
told
ye
how
set
he
is
on
his
young
days
an
nobody
knows
how
cruel
mean
used
to
be
to
him
but
i
never
see
it
come
out
of
him
so
ugly
before
though
i
did
blame
him
a
mite
but
i
hai
told
ye
the
upshot
he
says
to
smith
who
set
with
his
mouth
gappin
open
understand
how
i
feel
about
the
feller
an
i
got
good
reason
for
it
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
say
to
him
word
fer
word
jest
what
i
said
to
you
about
him
an
i
do
this
you
folks
send
him
to
the
poorhouse
an
let
him
git
jest
what
the
rest
on
gits
no
more
an
no
less
as
long
he
lives
when
he

you
git
him
the
tightest
coffin
you
kin
buy
to
keep
him
f
spilin
the
earth
as
long
as
may
be
an
then
you
send
me
the
hull
bill
but
this
has
got
to
be
between
you
an
me
only
you
tell
the
rest
of
the
committee
what
you
like
if
you
ever
tell
a
livin
soul
about
this
here
understandin
an
i
find
it
out
i
never
pay
one
cent
an
you
be
to
blame
i
willin
on
them
terms
to
stan
between
the
town
of
whitcom
an
harm
but
fer
harum
not
one
sumarkee
is
it
a
dave
says
sir
says
smith
puttin
out
his
hand
i
guess
he
says
all
i
gather
thet
you
doin
all
we
could
expect
more
too
an
off
he
put
how
it
come
out
asked
cullom
lived
about
two
year
replied
aunt
polly
an
dave
done
as
he
agreed
but
even
then
when
he
come
to
settle
up
he
told
smith
he
want
no
more
said
about
it
could
be
helped
said
cullom
it
seems
to
me
as
if
david
did
take
care
on
him
after
all
fur
spendin
money
was
concerned
that
the
way
it
looks
to
me
said
bixbee
but
david
likes
to
think
he
meant
to
be
awful
mean
an
he
was
as
mean
as
he
could
but
the
fact
is
he
did
reelly
know
how
my
sakes
cynthy
looking
at
the
clock
i
hev
to
excuse
myself
fer
a
spell
ef
you
want
to
do
any
fixin
up
dinner
jest
step
into
my
bedroom
laid
some
things
out
on
the
bed
if
you
should
happen
to
want
any
of
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
chapter
xxiii
david
house
stood
about
a
hundred
feet
back
from
the
street
facing
the
east
the
main
body
of
the
house
was
of
two
stories
through
which
ran
a
deep
bay
in
front
with
mansard
roof
on
the
south
of
the
main
body
of
the
house
were
two
stories
of
the
wing
in
which
were
the
settin
room
aunt
polly
room
and
above
david
quarters
ten
minutes
or
so
before
one
john
rang
the
bell
at
the
front
door
sairy
busy
said
bixbee
apologetically
as
she
let
him
in
so
i
come
to
the
door
myself
thank
you
very
much
said
john
harum
told
me
to
come
over
a
little
before
one
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
no
it
all
right
she
replied
for
mebbe
you
like
to
wash
an
fix
up
dinner
so
i
jest
show
ye
where
to
and
she
led
the
way
upstairs
and
into
the
front
parlor
bedroom
there
she
said
make
yourself
an
dinner
be
ready
in
about
ten
minutes
for
a
moment
john
mentally
rubbed
his
eyes
then
he
turned
and
caught
both
of
bixbee
hands
and
looked
at
her
speechless
when
he
found
words
he
said
i
do
know
what
to
say
nor
how
to
thank
you
properly
i
do
believe
you
know
how
kind
this
is
do
say
nothin
about
it
she
protested
but
with
a
look
of
great
satisfaction
i
done
it
jest
t
relieve
my
mind
because
ever
sence
you
fust
come
i
ben
worryin
over
your
bein
at
that
nasty
tavern
and
she
made
a
motion
to
go
you
and
your
brother
said
john
earnestly
still
holding
her
hands
have
made
me
a
gladder
and
happier
man
this
christmas
day
than
i
have
been
for
a
very
long
time
i
glad
o
she
said
heartily
an
i
hope

contented
here
i
must
go
now
an
help
sairy
dish
up
come
down
to
the
settin
room
when
you

and
she
gave
his
hands
a
little
squeeze
aunt
po
i
beg
pardon
bixbee
said
john
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
do
you
think
you
could
find
it
in
your
heart
to
complete
my
happiness
by
giving
me
a
kiss
it
christmas
you
know
he
added
smilingly
aunt
polly
colored
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
seein
i
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
i
guess
wo
hurt
me
none
and
as
she
went
down
the
stairs
she
softly
rubbed
her
lips
with
the
side
of
her
forefinger
john
understood
now
why
david
had
looked
out
of
the
bank
window
so
often
that
morning
all
his
belongings
were
in
aunt
polly
best
bedroom
having
been
moved
over
from
the
eagle
while
he
and
david
had
been
in
the
office
a
delightful
room
it
was
in
immeasurable
contrast
to
his
squalid
surroundings
at
that
hostelry
the
spacious
bed
with
its
snowy
counterpane
and
silk
patchwork
folded
on
the
foot
the
bright
fire
in
the
open
stove
the
big
bureau
and
glass
the
soft
carpet
the
table
for
writing
and
reading
standing
in
the
bay
his
books
on
the
broad
mantel
and
his
dressing
things
laid
out
ready
to
his
hand
not
to
mention
an
ample
supply
of
towels
on
the
rack
the
poor
fellow
life
during
the
weeks
which
he
had
lived
in
homeville
had
been
utterly
in
contrast
with
any
previous
experience
nevertheless
he
had
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
to
endure
the
monotony
the
dullness
the
entire
lack
of
companionship
and
entertainment
with
what
philosophy
he
could
muster
the
hours
spent
in
the
office
were
the
best
part
of
the
day
he
could
manage
to
find
occupation
for
all
of
them
though
a
village
bank
is
not
usually
a
scene
of
active
bustle
many
of
the
people
who
did
business
there
diverted
him
somewhat
and
most
of
them
seemed
never
too
much
in
a
hurry
to
stand
around
and
talk
the
sort
of
thing
that
interested
them
after
john
had
got
acquainted
with
his
duties
and
the
people
he
came
in
contact
with
david
gave
less
personal
attention
to
the
affairs
of
the
bank
but
he
was
in
and
out
frequently
during
the
day
and
rarely
failed
to
interest
his
cashier
with
his
observations
and
remarks
but
the
long
winter
evenings
had
been
very
bad
after
supper
a
meal
which
revolted
every
sense
there
had
been
as
many
hours
to
be
got
through
with
as
he
found
wakeful
an
empty
stomach
often
adding
to
the
number
of
them
and
the
only
resource
for
passing
the
time
had
been
reading
which
had
often
been
impossible
for
sheer
physical
discomfort
as
has
been
remarked
the
winter
climate
of
the
middle
portion
of
new
york
state
is
as
bad
as
can
be
imagined
his
light
was
a
kerosene
lamp
of
power
and
his
appliance
for
warmth
consisted
of
a
small
wood
stove
which
as
david
would
have
expressed
it
took
two
men
an
a
boy
to
keep
in
action
and
was
either
red
hot
or
exhausted
as
from
the
depths
of
a
spacious
lounging
chair
he
surveyed
his
new
surroundings
and
contrasted
them
with
those
from
which
he
had
been
rescued
out
of
pure
kindness
his
heart
was
full
and
it
can
hardly
be
imputed
to
him
as
a
weakness
that
for
a
moment
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
gratitude
and
happiness
no
less
indeed
there
were
four
happy
people
at
david
table
that
christmas
day
aunt
polly
had
smartened
up
cullom
with
collar
and
cuffs
and
in
various
ways
which
the
mind
of
man
comprehendeth
not
in
detail
and
there
had
been
some
arranging
of
her
hair
as
well
which
altogether
had
so
transformed
and
transfigured
her
that
john
thought
that
he
should
hardly
have
known
her
for
the
forlorn
creature
whom
he
had
encountered
in
the
morning
and
as
he
looked
at
the
still
fine
eyes
large
and
brown
and
shining
for
the
first
time
in
many
a
year
with
a
soft
light
of
happiness
he
felt
that
he
could
understand
how
it
was
that
billy
had
married
the
village
girl
bixbee
was
grand
in
black
silk
and
lace
collar
fastened
with
a
pin
not
quite
as
large
as
a
saucer
and
john
caught
the
sparkle
of
a
diamond
on
her
plump
left
hand
david
christmas
gift
with
regard
to
which
she
had
spoken
apologetically
to
cullom
i
told
david
that
i
was
ever
so
much
obliged
to
him
but
i
did
want
a
dimun
a
cat
wanted
a
flag
an
i
thought
it
was
jest
away
money
but
he
would
have
it
said
i
c
sell
it
an
keep
out
the
poorhouse
some
day
mebbe
david
had
not
made
much
change
in
his
usual
raiment
but
he
was
shaved
to
the
blood
and
his
round
red
face
shone
with
soap
and
satisfaction
as
he
tucked
his
napkin
into
his
shirt
collar
sairy
brought
in
the
tureen
of
oyster
soup
and
he
remarked
as
he
took
his
first
spoonful
of
the
stew
that
he
was
hungry
t
eat
a
graven
imidge
a
condition
that
john
was
able
to
sympathize
with
after
his
two
days
of
fasting
on
crackers
and
such
provisions
as
he
could
buy
at
purse
it
was
on
the
whole
he
reflected
the
most
enjoyable
dinner
that
he
ever
ate
never
was
such
a
turkey
and
to
see
it
give
way
under
skillful
knife
wings
drumsticks
second
joints
side
bones
breast
was
an
elevating
and
memorable
experience
and
such
potatoes
mashed
in
cream
such
boiled
onions
turnips
hubbard
squash
succotash
stewed
tomatoes
celery
cranberries
currant
jell
oh
and
to
top
off
with
a
mince
pie
to
die
for
and
a
pudding
new
to
john
but
just
you
try
it
some
time
of
steamed
indian
meal
and
fruit
with
a
sauce
of
cream
sweetened
with
shaved
maple
sugar
what
you
have
said
david
to
cullom
dark
meat
white

she
replied
meekly
i

david
do

he
remarked
how

you
john
little
o

eh
and
he
heaped
the
plate
till
our
friend
begged
him
to
keep
something
for
himself
little
too
much
is
jest
right
he
asserted
when
david
had
filled
the
plates
and
handed
them
along
sairy
was
for
bringing
in
and
taking
out
they
did
their
own
helping
to
vegetables
and
passin
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
got
out
of
his
chair
and
started
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
door
what
the
matter
asked
bixbee
in
surprise
where
you
goin
woodshed
said
david
woodshed
she
exclaimed
making
as
if
to
rise
and
follow
you
set
still
said
david
somethin
i
fergot
what
on
earth
she
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
annoyance
and
bewilderment
what
do
you
want
in
the
woodshed
ca
you
set
down
let
sairy
git
it
for
ye
no
he
asserted
with
a
grin
sairy
might
sqush
it
it
must
be
putty
meller
by
this
time
and
out
he
went
manners
ejaculated
bixbee
you
think
to
john
we
heathin
i
guess
not
said
john
smiling
and
much
amused
presently
sairy
appeared
with
four
tumblers
which
she
distributed
and
was
followed
by
david
bearing
a
bottle
he
seated
himself
and
began
a
struggle
to
unwire
the
same
with
an
aunt
polly
leaned
forward
with
a
look
of
perplexed
curiosity
what
you
got
there
she
asked
vewve
clikot
universal
an
remedy
said
david
reading
the
label
and
bringing
the
corners
of
his
eye
and
mouth
almost
together
in
a
wink
to
john
fer
toothache
earache
burns
scalds
warts
dispepsy
fallin
o
the
hair
windgall
ringbone
spavin
affections
an
pips
in
hens
and
out
came
the
cork
with
a
at
which
both
the
ladies
even
cullom
jumped
and
cried
out
david
harum
declared
his
sister
with
conviction
i
believe
thet
that
a
bottle
of
champagne
if
it
ai
said
david
pouring
into
his
tumbler
i
ben
swindled
out
o
four
shillin
and
he
passed
the
bottle
to
john
who
held
it
up
tentatively
looking
at
bixbee
no
thank
ye
she
said
with
a
little
toss
of
the
head
i
a
son
i
do
believe
she
remarked
to
cullom
thet
that
bottle
ever
cost
a
dollar
at
which
remarks
david
apparently
swallered
somethin
the
wrong
way
and
for
a
moment
or
two
was
unable
to
proceed
with
his
dinner
aunt
polly
looked
at
him
suspiciously
it
was
her
experience
that
in
her
intercourse
with
her
brother
he
often
laughed
utterly
without
reason
so
far
as
she
could
see
i
always
heard
it
was
dreadful
expensive
remarked
cullom
let
me
give
you
some
said
john
reaching
toward
her
with
the
bottle
cullom
looked
first
at
bixbee
and
then
at
david
i
do
know
she
said
i
never
tasted
any
take
a
little
said
david
nodding
approvingly
just
a
swallow
said
the
widow
whose
curiosity
had
got
the
better
of
scruples
she
took
a
swallow
of
the
wine
how
do
ye
like
it
asked
david
well
she
said
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
into
which
the
gas
had
driven
the
tears
i
guess
i
could
get
along
if
i
could
have
it
regular
do
taste
good
suggested
david
with
a
grin
well
she
replied
i
never
did
care
any
great
for
cider
and
this
tastes
to
me
about
as
if
i
was
drinkin
cider
an
snuffin
horseradish
at
one
and
the
same
time
how
that
john
said
david
laughing
i
suppose
it
an
acquired
taste
said
john
returning
the
laugh
and
taking
a
mouthful
of
the
wine
with
infinite
relish
i
do
think
i
ever
enjoyed
a
glass
of
wine
so
much
or
turning
to
aunt
polly
ever
enjoyed
a
dinner
so
much
which
statement
completely
mollified
her
feelings
which
had
been
the
least
bit
in
the
world
set
edgeways
mebbe
your
got
somethin
to
do
with
it
said
david
shoveling
a
of
good
things
into
his
mouth
polly
this
young
man
ben
livin
on
crackers
an
salt
herrin
fer
a
week
my
land
cried
bixbee
with
an
expression
of
horror
is
that
reelly
so
ai
now
reelly
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
john
answered
smiling
but
elright
has
been
ill
for
a
couple
of
days
and
well
i
have
been
foraging
around
purse
store
a
little
of
all
the
mean
shames
exclaimed
aunt
polly
indignantly
david
harum
you
ought
to
be
t
allow
such
a
thing
i
never
said
david
holding
his
knife
and
fork
straight
up
in
either
fist
as
they
rested
on
the
table
and
staring
at
his
sister
i
believe
if
the
roof
was
to
blow
off
you
lay
it
onto
me
somehow
i
hai
ben
runnin
the
eagle
tavern
fer
quite
a
while
you
got
the
wrong
pig
by
the
ear
as
usual
jest
you
pitch
into
him
pointing
with
his
fork
to
john
it
his
funeral
if
anybody
said
aunt
polly
addressing
john
in
a
tone
of
injury
i
do
think
you
might
have
let
somebody
know
i
think
you
ortter
known
yes
bixbee
he
interrupted
i
did
know
how
kind
you
are
and
would
have
been
and
if
matters
had
gone
on
so
much
longer
i
should
have
appealed
to
you
i
should
have
indeed
but
really
he
added
smiling
at
her
a
dinner
like
this
is
worth
fasting
a
week
for
she
said
mollified
again
you
wo
git
no
more
you
ask
fer
that
is
just
what
your
brother
said
this
morning
replied
john
looking
at
david
with
a
laugh
chapter
xxiv
the
meal
proceeded
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
cullom
had
said
but
little
but
john
noticed
that
her
diction
was
more
conventional
than
in
her
talk
with
david
and
himself
in
the
morning
and
that
her
manner
at
the
table
was
distinctly
refined
although
she
ate
with
apparent
appetite
not
to
say
hunger
presently
she
said
with
an
air
of
making
conversation
i
suppose
you
always
lived
in
the
city
mr
lenox
it
has
always
been
my
home
he
replied
but
i
have
been
away
a
good
deal
i
suppose
folks
in
the
city
go
to
theaters
a
good
deal
she
remarked
they
have
a
great
many
opportunities
said
john
wondering
what
she
was
leading
up
to
but
he
was
not
to
discover
for
david
broke
in
with
a
chuckle
ask
polly
mis
cullom
he
said
she
tell
ye
all
about
the
theater
polly
kin
cullom

david
cheerfully

mis
cullom
dave
harum
expostulated
bixbee
but
he
proceeded
without
heed
of
her
protest
polly
an
i
he
said

down
to
new
york
one
spring
some
years

remarked
bixbee
with
a
sniff
that
spoke
volumes
of
her
opinion
of
the
feller
wife
david
emitted
a
chuckle
he
continued
i
took
the
tickits
on
the
feller
recommend
an
the
fact
of
his
wife
bein
so
an
after
supper
we
went
it
was
a
mighty
handsome
place
inside
gilded
an
carved
all
over
like
the
outside
of
a

a
postage

john
stole
a
glance
at
cullom
she
was
staring
at
the
speaker
with
eyes
of
horror
and
amazement
i
guess
i
would
go
very
into
said
bixbee
in
a
warning
tone
david
bent
his
head
down
over
his
plate
and
shook
from
head
to
foot
and
it
was
nearly
a
minute
before
he
was
able
to
go
on
he
said
i
heard
polly
give
a
kind
of
a
gasp
an
a
snort
if
some
one
throwed
water
her
face
but
she
did
say
nothin
an
i
swan
i
dast
to

crowd
more
girls
that

their
in
their

or
somewhere
singin
an
dancin
an
weavin
on
the
stage
an
after

he
he
david

my
victuals

the
kitchin

see
no
more
of
she
added
to
cullom
and
john
after
that
fust
trollop
appeared
i
do
believe
she
did
said
david
fer
when
i
turned
she
set
there
with
her
eys
shut
tighter
a
drum
an
her
mouth
shut
too
so
her
nose
an
chin
most
come
together
an
her
face
was
red
enough
so
a
streak
o
red
paint
made
a
white
mark
on
it
i
says
afraid
you
ai
gettin
the
wuth
o
your
money
harum
she
says
with
her
mouth
shut
all
but
a
little
place
in
the
corner
toward
me
you
do
take
me
out
o
this
place
i
go
without

she
says
you
think
you
c
stan
it
a
little
longer
i
says
they
sent
home
fer
their
i
says
he
he
he
he
but
with
that
she
jest
give
a
hump
to
start
an
i
see
she
meant
when
polly
bixbee
said
david
impressively
puts
that
foot
o
somethin
got
to
sqush
an
do
you
fergit
it
bixbee
made
no
acknowledgment
of
this
tribute
to
her
strength
of
character
john
looked
at
david
yes
he
said
with
a
solemn
bend
of
the
head
as
if
in
answer
to
a
question
i
squshed
i
says
to
her
right
do
make
no
disturbance
you
help
an
jest
put
your
up
to
your
nose
if
you
had
the
nosebleed
an
we
squeezed
out
of
the
seats
sneaked
up
the
aisle
an
by
the
time
we
got
out
into
the
entry
i
guess
my
face
was
as
red
as
polly
it
could
ben
no
redder
he
added
you
got
a
putty
fair
color
as
a
thing
remarked
bixbee
dryly
yes
yes
i
expect
that
so
he
assented
but
i
got
an
extry
coat
o
tan
follerin
you
out
o
that
theater
when
we
got
out
into
the
entry
one
o
them
fellers
that
stands
steps
up
to
me
says
your
ma
feelin
well
he
says
feelin
has
ben
a
trifle
rumpled
up
i
says
that
brings
on
the
nosebleed
an
then
said
david
looking
over
bixbee
head
the
feller
went
an
leaned
up
agin
the
wall
david
harum
exclaimed
bixbee
that
a
downright
you
never
spoke
to
a
soul
an
an
knows
i
ai
more
four
years
older
you
be
you
see
polly
her
brother
replied
in
a
smooth
tone
of
measureless
aggravation
the
feller
acquainted
with
us
an
he
only
went
by
appearances
aunt
polly
appealed
to
john
ai
he
enough
to
to
i
d
know
what
i
really
do
see
how
you
live
with
him
said
john
laughing
cullom
face
wore
a
faint
smile
as
if
she
were
conscious
that
something
amusing
was
going
on
but
was
not
quite
sure
what
the
widow
took
things
seriously
for
the
most
part
poor
soul
i
reckon
you
have
followed
much
after
that
she
said
to
her
hostess
no
bixbee
replied
with
emphasis
you
better
believe
i
hai
i
hai
never
thought
of
it
sence
without
tinglin
all
over
i
believe
she
asserted
that
david
stayed
the
thing
out
if
it
had
ben
fer
me
but
as
true
you
live
cynthy
cullom
i
was
so
at
the
little
i
did
see
that
when
i
come
to
go
to
bed
i
took
my
off
in
the
dark
david
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter
bixbee
looked
at
him
with
unmixed
scorn
if
i
could
help
makin
a
she
began
i
oh
lord
polly
david
broke
in
be
sure
wrap
up
when
you
go
out
if
you
sh
ketch
cold
an
your
sense
o
the
sh
strike
in
you
be
a
sure
this
was
treated
with
the
silent
contempt
which
it
deserved
and
david
fell
upon
his
dinner
with
the
remark
that
he
guessed
he
better
make
up
fer
lost
time
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
while
he
had
done
most
of
the
talking
he
had
by
no
means
suspended
another
function
of
his
mouth
while
so
engaged
for
a
time
nothing
more
was
said
which
did
not
relate
to
the
replenishment
of
plates
glasses
and
cups
finally
david
cleaned
up
his
plate
with
his
knife
blade
and
a
piece
of
bread
and
pushed
it

john
did
nothing
loath
david
ate
his
pie
in
silence
but
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
attack
the
pudding
which
was
his
favorite
confection
he
gave
an
audible
chuckle
which
elicited
bixbee
notice
what
you
gigglin
now
she
asked
david
laughed
i
was
thinkin
of
somethin
i
heard
up
to

said
as
he
covered
his
pudding
with
the
thick
cream
sauce
amri

she
exclaimed
that
ole
shack
who
in

the
lucky
woman
replied
david
with
a
grin
if
that
do
beat
all
said
bixbee
throwing
up
her
hands
and
even
from
cullom
was
drawn
a
well
i
never

said
david

bixbee
indignantly
do

that
trew
love

its
course
asked
david
with
an
air
of
sentiment

she
reiterated
them
two

children
polly
you
make
me
blush
protested
her
brother
hai
you
got
no
respect
fer

holy
institution
of
matrimuny
and
at
he
added
wiping
his
whole
face
with
his
napkin
much
as
you
hev
i
reckon
she
retorted
of
all
the
amazin
things
in

the
amazinist
to
me
is
the
kind
of
people
that

with
an
air
of
conviction
and
then
he
broke
into
a
laugh
ef

said
bixbee
impatiently
said
david

of

david
concluded
i
do
know
what
is
an
be
they
actially

asked
bixbee
still
incredulous
of
anything
so
preposterous
so
dick
says
was
the
reply
he
says
am
an
lize
come
away
f
the
dominie
putty
down
in
the
mouth
but
long
amri
braced
up
allowed
that
if

half
a
dollar
he
try
the
squire
in

mornin
an
dick

says
slappin
his
leg

dum
he
says
would
missed
it
fer
double
the
money
here
david
folded
his
napkin
and
put
it
in
the
ring
and
john
finished
the
cup
of
clear
coffee
which
aunt
polly
rather
under
protest
had
given
him
coffee
without
cream
and
sugar
was
incomprehensible
to
bixbee
chapter
xxv
two
or
three
days
after
christmas
john
was
sitting
in
his
room
in
the
evening
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
to
his
come
in
there
entered
harum
who
was
warmly
welcomed
and
entreated
to
take
the
big
chair
which
after
a
cursory
survey
of
the
apartment
and
its
furnishings
he
did
saying
i
thought
i
come
in
an
see
how
polly
got
you
fixed
whether
the
baskit
casket
was
worthy
of
the
as
i
heard
a
feller
say
in
a
theater
once
i
was
never
more
comfortable
in
my
life
said
john
bixbee
has
been
kindness
itself
and
even
permits
me
to
smoke
in
the
room
let
me
give
you
a
cigar
heh
you
got
putty
well
polly
i
reckon
said
david
looking
around
the
room
as
he
lighted
the
cigar
an
i
glad
i
reckon
is
a
shade
better
the
eagle
he
remarked
with
his
characteristic
chuckle
i
should
say
so
said
john
emphatically
and
i
am
more
obliged
than
i
can
tell
you
all
polly
doin
asserted
david
holding
the
end
of
his
cigar
critically
under
his
nose
that
a
trifle
better
article
i
in
the
habit
of
smokin
he
remarked
i
think
it
my
one
extravagance
said
john
but
i
do
smoke
them
exclusively
i
am
very
fond
of
good
tobacco
and
i
understand
said
david
an
if
i
had
my
life
to
live
over
agin
knowin
what
i
do
now
i
do
in
a
number
o
ways
i
often
think
he
proceeded
as
he
took
a
pull
at
the
cigar
and
emitted
the
smoke
with
a
chewing
movement
of
his
mouth
of
what
andy
brown
used
to
say
andy
was
a
curious
kind
of
a
customer
i
used
to
know
up
to
syrchester
he
liked
good
things
andy
did
an
did
scrimp
himself
when
they
was
to
be
had
that
is
when
he
had
the
to
git
with
he
used
to
say
whenever
you
git
holt
of
a
note
you
want
to
git
it
ye
or
ye
jest
quick
you
kin
we
here
an
gone
he
say
the
ai
no
pocket
in
a
shroud
an
i
dum
if
i
do
think
sometimes
declared
harum
that
he
very
fur
off
neither
any
rate
he
added
with
a
philosophy
unexpected
by
his
hearer
i
look
back
it
the
money
i
spent
fer
the
good
times
i
had
i
regret
the
good
times
i
might
well
had
an
did
i
inclined
to
think
he
remarked
with
an
air
of
having
given
the
matter
consideration
that
after
adam
an
eve
got
bounced
out
of
the
they
kicked
themselves
as
much
as
anythin
fer
not
havin
cleaned
up
the
hull
tree
while
they
was
about
it
john
laughed
and
said
that
that
was
very
likely
among
their
regrets
trouble
with
me
was
said
david
that
till
i
was
older
you
be
i
had
to
scratch
like
all
possessed
an
it
hard
work
now
sometimes
to
git
the
idee
out
of
my
head
but
what
the
money
wuth
more
the
things
i
guess
he
remarked
looking
at
the
brushes
and
the
various
toilet
of
and
silver
which
adorned
john
bureau
and
indicating
them
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
that
up
to
about
now
you
ben
in
the
habit
of
figurin
the
other
way
mostly
too
much
so
perhaps
said
john
but
yet
after
all
i
do
think
i
am
sorry
i
would
spend
the
money
for
those
things
now
but
i
am
glad
i
bought
them
when
i
did
jess
so
jess
so
said
david
appreciatively
he
reached
over
to
the
table
and
laid
his
cigar
on
the
edge
of
a
book
and
reaching
for
his
hip
pocket
produced
a
silver
tobacco
box
at
which
he
looked
contemplatively
for
a
moment
opening
and
shutting
the
lid
with
a
snap
there
he
said
holding
it
out
on
his
palm
i
was
twenty
years
up
my
mind
to
buy
that
box
an
to
this
day
i
ca
bring
myself
to
carry
it
all
the
time
yes
sir
i
wanted
that
box
fer
twenty
years
i
do
mean
to
say
that
i
did
spend
the
wuth
of
it
foolishly
times
over
an
agin
but
i
could
never
make
up
my
mind
to
put
that
amount
o
money
into
that
thing
i
was
alwus
figurin
that
some
day
i
have
a
silver
tobacco
box
an
i
sometimes
think
the
reason
it
seemed
so
an
i
put
it
off
so
long
was
because
i
wanted
it
so
much
now
i
you
could
understand
that
could
ye
yes
said
john
nodding
his
head
thoughtfully
i
think
i
can
understand
it
perfectly
and
indeed
it
spoke
pages
of
biography
yes
sir
said
david
i
never
spent
a
small
amount
o
money
but
one
other
time
an
got
so
much
value
only
i
alwus
ben
kickin
myself
to
think
i
did
do
it
sooner
perhaps
suggested
john
you
enjoyed
it
all
the
more
for
waiting
so
long
no
said
david
it
that
i
dunno
was
the
feelin
got
there
at
last
i
guess
fur
waitin
fer
things
is
concerned
is
such
a
thing
as
waitin
too
long
your
appetite
change
mebbe
i
used
to
think
when
i
was
a
youngster
that
if
ever
i
got
where
i
c
have
all
the
custard
pie
i
c
eat
that
be
all
i
ask
fer
i
used
to
imagine
bein
baked
into
one
an
eatin
my
way
out
nowdays
the
a
good
many
things
i
sooner
have
than
custard
pie
though
he
said
with
a
wink
i
do
eat
two
pieces
jest
to
please
polly
john
laughed
what
was
the
other
thing
he
asked
other
thing
i
once
bought
queried
david
oh
yes
it
was
the
fust
hoss
i
ever
owned
i
give
fifteen
dollars
fer
him
an
if
he
a
dandy
you
need
pay
me
a
cent
crowbait
no
name
fer
him
he
was
stun
blind
on
the
off
side
an
could
see
anythin
in
on
the
nigh
side
could
get
nigh
i
reckon
an
had
most
wrong
with
him
that
c
ail
a
hoss
but
i
thought
he
was
a
thoroughbred
i
was
seventeen
year
old
then
an
was
on
the
erie
canal
an
when
the
no
boat
through
i
put
in
most
o
my
time
cleanin
that
hoss
if
he
got
through
less
six
times
a
day
he
got
off
cheap
an
once
i
got
up
an
give
him
a
little
attention
at
night
yes
sir
if
i
got
big
money
wuth
out
o
that
box
it
was
mostly
a
matter
of
feelin
but
as
fur
that
old
plugamore
of
a
hoss
was
concerned
i
got
it
both
ways
for
i
got
my
fust
real
start
out
of
his
old
carkiss
yes
said
john
encouragingly
yes
sir
affirmed
david
i
cleaned
him
up
an
fed
him
up
almost
got
he
c
see
enough
out
of
his
left
eye
to
shy
at
a
load
of
hay
close
by
an
traded
him
off
fer
another
an
fifteen
dollars
to
boot
were
you
as
enthusiastic
over
the
next
one
as
the
first
asked
john
laughing
replied
david
relighting
his
temporarily
abandoned
cigar
against
a
protest
and
proffer
of
a
fresh
one
he
did
lay
holt
on
my
affections
to
quite
the
same
extent
i
done
my
duty
by
him
but
i
did
set
up
with
him
nights
you
see
he
added
with
a
grin
i
got
some
used
to
bein
a
hoss
owner
an
the
edge
had
wore
off
some
he
smoked
for
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
with
as
much
apparent
relish
as
if
the
cigar
had
not
been
stale
are
you
going
on
asked
john
at
last
he
replied
pleased
with
his
audience
i
c
go
on
i
fast
enough
an
fur
enough
but
i
do
want
to
tire
ye
out
i
reckon
you
never
had
much
to
do
with
canals
no
said
john
smiling
i
ca
say
that
i
have
but
i
know
something
about
the
subject
in
a
general
way
and
there
is
no
fear
of
your
tiring
me
out
all
right
proceeded
david
as
i
was
sayin
i
got
another
equine
wonder
an
fifteen
dollars
to
boot
fer
my
old
plug
an
it
a
great
while
before
i
was
in
the
hoss
to
stay
after
between
two
an
three
years
i
had
fifty
or
sixty
hosses
an
mules
an
took
all
sorts
of
towin
jobs
then
a
big
towin
concern
quit
an
i
bought
their
hull
stock
an
got
my
money
back
three
four
times
over
by
the
time
i
was
about
i
had
got
ahead
enough
to
quit
the
canal
an
all
its
works
fer
good
an
go
into
other
things
but
there
was
where
i
got
my
livin
after
i
run
away
f
buxton
hill
before
i
got
the
job
of
i
had
made
the
trip
to
albany
an
back
twice
my
passage
as
they
used
to
call
it
an
i
made
one
trip
helpin
steer
so
my
canal
experience
was
putty
thorough
take
it
all
it
must
have
been
a
pretty
hard
life
remarked
john
david
took
out
his
penknife
and
proceeded
to
impale
his
cigar
upon
the
blade
thereof
no
he
said
to
john
proffer
of
the
box
this
last
quite
a
spell
yet
he
resumed
after
a
moment
in
reply
to
john
remark
viewin
it
all
by
itself
it
a
hard
life
a
thing
is
hard
though
i
reckon
because
it
harder
somethin
else
or
you
think
so
most
things
go
by
comparin
i
if
the
run
of
trotters
never
got
better
three
a
half
that
a
hoss
that
c
do
it
in
three
be
fast
but
we
do
call
so
nowdays
i
if
at
that
same
age
you
had
to
tackle
the
life
you
found
it
hard
the
was
hard
things
about
it
trampin
all
night
in
the
rain
fer
instance
sleepin
in
barns
at
times
an
all
that
an
once
the
o
the
boat
got
mad
at
somethin
an
pitched
me
head
over
heels
into
the
canal
it
was
about
the
close
of
navigation
an
the
was
a
scum
of
ice
i
scrambled
out
somehow
but
he
would
cared
if
i
ben
drownded
he
was
an
exception
though
the
canalers
was
a
rough
set
in
but
they
averaged
fer
disposition
like
the
run
o
folks
the
was
mean
ones
an
clever
ones
them
that
would
put
upon
ye
them
that
would
treat
ye
decent
the
work
was
hard
an
the
grub
alwus
much
better
what
you
he
he
he
what
you
ben
gettin
at
the
eagle
john
was
now
by
the
way
of
rather
relishing
jokes
on
that
subject
but
i
had
ben
raised
in
the
lap
o
luxury
not
to
any
extent
not
enough
to
stick
my
nose
up
much
the
men
i
worked
fer
was
rough
an
i
got
my
share
of
cusses
an
cuffs
an
once
in
a
while
a
kick
to
keep
up
my
spirit
of
perseverance
but
on
the
hull
i
think
i
got
more
kindness
i
did
at
home
leavin
polly
out
an
as
fer
treatment
none
on
c
come
up
to
my
father
wuss
yet
my
oldest
brother
the
that
throwed
me
overboard
was
the
wust
but
alongside
o
he
was
a
forty
hosspower
angil
with
a
hull
music
store
o
harps
an
even
my
father
c
given
him
cards
an
spades
an
as
fer
the
victuals
here
david
dropped
his
cigar
end
and
pulled
from
his
pocket
the
silver
tobacco
box
as
fer
the
victuals
he
repeated
they
mostly
averaged
up
putty
high
after
what
i
ben
used
to
why
i
do
believe
i
ever
tasted
a
piece
of
beefsteak
or
roast
beef
in
my
life
till
after
i
left
home
when
we
had
meat
at
all
it
was
pork
boiled
pork
fried
pork
pigs
liver
an
all
that
enough
to
make
you
to
look
a
pig
in
the
face
an
fer
the
rest
potatoes
an
duff
an
an
meal
mush
an
milk
emptins
bread
that
you
c
smell
a
mile
after
it
got
cold
with
folks
on
a
small
farm
nuthin
c
afford
to
be
eat
that
c
be
sold
that
could
be
sold
had
to
be
eat
once
in
a
while
the
be
pie
of
some
kind
or
gingerbread
but
with
to
eat
i
ever
git
more
enough
to
set
me
hankerin
i
must
say
that
i
think
i
should
have
liked
the
canal
better
remarked
john
as
david
paused
you
were
at
any
rate
more
or
less
free
that
is
comparatively
i
should
say
yes
sir
i
did
said
david
an
i
never
see
the
time
no
matter
how
rough
things
was
that
i
wished
i
was
back
on
buxton
hill
i
used
to
want
to
see
polly
putty
bad
once
in
a
while
an
used
to
figure
that
if
i
ever
growed
up
to
be
a
man
an
had
money
enough
i
buy
her
a
new
pair
o
shoes
an
the
stuff
fer
a
dress
an
sometimes
my
went
as
fur
a
gold
breastpin
but
i
never
wanted
to
see
none
o
the
rest
on
an
fer
that
matter
i
never
did
yes
sir
the
old
ditch
was
better
to
me
than
the
place
i
was
borned
in
an
as
you
say
i
nobody
slave
an
i
scairt
to
death
the
hull
time
some
o
the
men

rough
but
they
cruel
as
a
rule
an
as
i
growed
up
a
little
i
was
putty
well
able
to
look
out
fer
myself
looking
at
his
watch

enough
o
my
meemores
fer

sittin
no
really
john
protested

a

up
and
brought
a

of

david
with
a
comical

under
protest

his
own
liquor
raw
as
was
the
custom
in

presently
he

a
little
farther
down
in

a
look
of
amused
recollection

grin
getting
up
and
helping
himself

the
palliating
mouthful
of
water
he
resumed

with

rueful
recollection
i

david
dryly

pleaded
john
when
he

of
emotion
it
kicked
up
in
my
breast
at
the
time
i
cleaned
myself
up
with
a
towel
well
i
could
an
thought
i

john
when
he
recovered
his
voice
and
then
with
as
clear
an
expression
of
innocence

somewhat
irrelevantly
asked

one
was
suddinly
to
holler
low
bridge
that
nineteen
out
o
twenty
their
and
then
queried
john
said
david
all
on
laughed
some
but
price
he
jest
lay
back
an
roared
and
i
found
out
afterwuds
added
david
that
man
at
the
table
except
the
know
what
bridge
meant
from
actial
experience
scat
my
he
exclaimed
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
ai
hardly
wuth
while
undressin
and
started
for
the
door
as
he
was
halfway
through
it
he
turned
and
said
say
i
known
what
to
do
with
that
egg
but
he
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
chapter
xxviii
it
must
not
be
understood
that
the
harums
larrabees
robinsons
elrights
and
sundry
who
have
thus
far
been
mentioned
represented
the
only
types
in
the
prosperous
and
enterprising
village
of
homeville
and
david
perhaps
somewhat
magnified
the
importance
of
the
cullom
family
although
he
was
speaking
of
a
period
some
forty
years
earlier
be
that
as
it
may
there
were
now
a
good
many
families
most
of
them
descendants
of
early
settlers
who
lived
in
good
and
even
fine
houses
and
were
people
of
refinement
and
considerable
wealth
these
constituted
a
coterie
of
their
own
though
they
were
on
terms
of
acquaintance
and
comity
with
the
village
people
as
they
designated
the
rank
and
file
of
the
homeville
population
to
these
houses
came
in
the
summer
sons
and
daughters
nieces
nephews
and
grandchildren
and
at
the
period
of
which
i
am
writing
there
had
been
built
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
or
in
its
vicinity
a
number
of
handsome
and
stately
residences
by
people
who
had
been
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
situation
and
the
salubrity
of
the
summer
climate
and
so
for
some
months
in
the
pleasant
season
the
village
was
enlivened
by
a
concourse
of
visitors
who
brought
with
them
urban
customs
costumes
and
equipages
and
gave
a
good
deal
of
life
and
color
to
the
village
streets
then
did
homeville
put
its
best
foot
forward
and
money
in
its
pouch
i
ai
what
ye
might
call
an
old
residenter
said
david
though
i
was
part
raised
on
buxton
hill
an
i
ai
so
well
with
the
nabobs
but
polly
lived
in
the
village
ever
sence
she
got
married
knows
their
dam
an
sire
an
pedigree
of
course
he
remarked
i
know
all
the
men
folks
an
they
know
me
but
i
never
ben
into
none
o
their
houses
except
now
an
then
on
a
matter
of
an
i
guess
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
polly
allow
she
do
spend
all
her
time
in
that
circle
still
he
added
they
all
know
her
an
little
while
some
o
the
women
folks
come
in
see
her
she
putty
popular
polly
is
he
concluded
i
should
think
so
indeed
remarked
john
yes
sir
said
david
the
worse
folks
polly
bixbee
if
she
put
on
no
style
an
the
fact
is
that
some
of
the
folks
that
lives
here
the
year
an
always
have
an
call
the
rest
on
us
people
jest
as
countryfied
in
their
way
me
an
polly
is
in
only
they
do
know
it
the
only
is
the
way
they
talk
an
live
john
looked
at
harum
in
some
doubt
as
to
the
seriousness
of
the
last
remark
go
to
the
church
an
have
what
they
call
dinner
at
six
said
david
now
there
the
verjooses
he
continued
the
verjoos
come
an
settled
here
some
time
in
the
thirties
i
reckon
he
was
some
kind
of
a
dutchman
i
guess
dutchman
was
harum
generic
name
for
all
people
native
to
the
continent
of
europe
but
he
had
some
money
an
bought
land
morgidges
an
so
on
an
havin
money
money
was
awful
scurce
in
them
early
days
made
more
never
spent
anythin
to
speak
of
an
died
pinchin
the
cent
he
started
in
with
he
was
the
father
of
verjoos
the
other
banker
here
i
suppose
said
john
yes
said
david
the
was
two
boys
an
a
sister
the
oldest
son
alferd
went
into
the
law
an
done
in
albany
an
moved
to
new
york
but
he
always
kept
up
the
old
place
here
the
old
man
left
what
was
a
good
deal
o
propity
fer
them
days
an
alf
he
kept
his
share
an
made
more
he
was
in
the
assembly
two
three
terms
member
of
congress
an
they
do
say
remarked
harum
with
a
wink
that
he
never
lost
no
money
by
his
politics
on
the
other
hand
made
more
or
less
of
a
muddle
o
an
they
set
him
up
in
the
bankin
i
say
because
the
verjooses
the
rogerses
an
the
swaynes
an
a
lot
of
is
all
more
or
less
related
to
each
other
but
alf
reely
the
one
at
the
bottom
o
after
the
lost
most
of
his
money
it
was
the
easiest
way
to
kind
keep
him
on
his
legs
he
seems
a
sort
of
person
said
john
by
way
of
comment
and
truth
to
say
not
very
much
interested
oh
yes
said
david
rather
contemptuously
you
could
drive
him
with
a
tow
string
he
do
enough
to
run
away
but
what
i
was
at
was
this
he
an
his
wife
he
married
one
of
the
tenakers
has
lived
right
here
fer
the
lord
knows
how
long
born
an
brought
up
here
both
on
an
somehow
we
people
an
they
ai
that
all
rather
a
fine
distinction
remarked
his
hearer
smiling
yes
sir
said
david
now
there
old
maid
allis
relative
of
the
rogerses
lives
all
alone
down
on
clark
street
in
an
old
house
that
hai
had
a
coat
o
paint
or
a
new
shingle
sence
the
three
thayers
was
hung
an
she
talks
about
the
folks
next
door
both
sides
that
knowed
alwus
as
people
and
i
do
believe
asserted
the
speaker
she
was
ever
away
f
homeville
two
weeks
in
the
hull
course
of
her
life
she
a
putty
decent
sort
of
a
woman
too
harum
admitted
if
the
was
a
death
in
the
house
she
go
in
an
help
but
she
would
never
think
of
askin
one
on
to
tea
i
suppose
you
have
heard
it
said
remarked
john
laughing
that
it
takes
all
sorts
of
people
to
make
a
world
i
think
i
hev
heard
a
rumor
to
that
effect
said
david
an
i
guess
the
about
as
much
human
nature
in
some
folks
as
the
is
in
others
if
not
more
and
i
do
fancy
that
it
makes
very
much
difference
to
you
said
john
whether
the
verjooses
or
miss
allis
call
you
people
or
not
do
cut
no
figger
at
all
declared
harum
polly
i
are
too
old
to
set
up
fer
shapes
even
if
we
wanted
to
a
good
fair
good
enough
fer
me
three
square
meals
a
small
portion
of
the
weed
as
it
called
in
a
hoss
two
a
note
where
you
lay
your
hand
o
an
once
in
a
while
when
your
consciunce
pricks
ye
a
little
somethin
to
permote
the
cause
o
make
the
inwurd
moniter
quit
jerkin
the
reins
i
guess
i
git
along
heh
yes
said
john
by
way
of
making
some
rejoinder
if
one
has
all
one
needs
it
is
enough
yes
observed
the
philosopher
that
so
as
you
might
say
up
to
a
certain
an
in
some
i
a
feller
could
git
along
but
at
the
same
time
i
noticed
that
speakin
a
leetle
too
big
about
the
right
size
i
am
told
said
john
after
a
pause
in
which
the
conversation
seemed
to
be
dying
out
for
lack
of
fuel
and
apropos
of
nothing
in
particular
that
homeville
is
quite
a
summer
resort
quite
a
responded
harum
it
has
ben
to
some
extent
fer
a
good
many
years
an
it
gettin
more
an
more
so
all
the
time
only
i
mean
he
said
that
the
folks
that
come
now
make
more
show
an
most
on
who
ai
visitin
their
relations
either
has
places
of
their
own
or
hires
fer
the
summer
one
time
some
folks
used
to
come
an
stay
at
the
hotel
the
was
quite
a
fair
one
then
he
explained
but
it
burned
up
an
never
built
up
agin
because
it
had
got
not
to
be
thought
the
thing
to
put
up
there
robinson
dug
wife
an
mis
truman
on
laylock
street
has
some
that
come
an
board
with
them
year
but
that
about
all
the
boardin
the
is
nowdays
harum
stopped
and
looked
at
his
companion
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
as
if
something
had
just
occurred
to
him
the
be
more
o
your
kind
o
folk
come
summer
he
said
and
then
on
a
second
thought
you
ai
ye
i
have
always
attended
that
service
replied
john
smiling
and
i
have
gone
to
james
here
nearly
every
sunday
hai
they
taken
any
notice
of
ye
asked
david
euston
the
rector
called
upon
me
said
john
but
i
have
made
no
further
acquaintances
said
david
and
after
a
moment
in
a
sort
of
confidential
tone
do
you
like
goin
to
church
he
asked
well
said
john
that
depends
yes
i
think
i
do
i
think
it
is
the
proper
thing
he
concluded
weakly
depends
some
on
how
a
feller
ben
brought
up
do
ye
think
so
said
david
i
should
think
it
very
likely
john
assented
struggling
manfully
with
a
yawn
i
guess
that
about
my
case
remarked
harum
an
i
sh
have
to
admit
that
i
ai
much
of
a
hand
fer
polly
has
the
charge
of
that
branch
of
the
an
the
one
i
stay
away
from
when
i
go
he
said
with
a
grin
the
prespyteriun
john
laughed
no
sir
said
david
i
ai
much
of
a
hand
polly
used
to
worry
at
me
about
it
till
i
says
to
her
i
says
tell
ye
what
i
do
i
compermise
with
ye
i
says
undertake
to
foller
right
along
in
your
track
i
hai
got
the
speed
i
says
f
now
on
i
go
to
church
on
thanksgivin
it
was
putty
near
thanksgivin
time
he
remarked
an
i
dunno
but
she
thought
if
she
c
git
me
started
i
finish
the
heat
an
so
we
fixed
it
at
that
of
course
said
john
with
a
laugh
you
kept
your
promise
sir
declared
david
with
the
utmost
gravity
fer
the
next
five
years
i
never
missed
attendin
church
on
thanksgivin
day
but
times
but
after
that
he
added
i
had
to
beg
off
it
was
too
much
of
a
strain
he
declared
with
a
chuckle
an
it
took
more
time
polly
c
really
afford
to
git
me
ready
and
so
he
rambled
on
upon
such
topics
as
suggested
themselves
to
his
mind
or
in
reply
to
his
comments
and
questions
which
were
indeed
more
perfunctory
than
otherwise
for
the
verjooses
the
rogerses
the
swaynes
and
the
rest
were
people
whom
john
not
only
did
not
know
but
whom
he
neither
expected
nor
cared
to
know
and
so
his
present
interest
in
them
was
extremely
small
outside
of
his
regular
occupations
and
despite
the
improvement
in
his
domestic
environment
life
was
so
dull
for
him
that
he
could
not
imagine
its
ever
being
otherwise
in
homeville
it
was
a
year
since
the
world
his
world
had
come
to
an
end
and
though
his
sensations
of
loss
and
defeat
had
passed
the
acute
stage
his
mind
was
far
from
healthy
he
had
evaded
david
question
or
only
half
answered
it
when
he
merely
replied
that
the
rector
had
called
upon
him
the
truth
was
that
some
tentative
advances
had
been
made
to
him
and
euston
had
presented
him
to
a
few
of
the
people
in
his
flock
but
beyond
the
point
of
mere
politeness
he
had
made
no
response
mainly
from
indifference
but
to
a
degree
because
of
a
suspicion
that
his
connection
with
harum
would
not
to
say
the
least
enhance
his
position
in
the
minds
of
certain
of
the
people
of
homeville
as
has
been
intimated
it
seemed
at
the
outset
of
his
career
in
the
village
as
if
there
had
been
a
combination
of
circumstance
and
effort
to
put
him
on
his
guard
and
indeed
rather
to
prejudice
him
against
his
employer
and
harum
as
it
now
appeared
to
our
friend
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
laid
himself
open
to
misjudgment
if
no
more
no
allusion
had
ever
been
made
to
the
episode
of
the
counterfeit
money
by
either
his
employer
or
himself
and
it
was
not
till
months
afterward
that
the
subject
was
brought
up
by
richard
larrabee
who
sauntered
into
the
bank
one
morning
finding
no
one
there
but
john
he
leaned
over
the
counter
on
his
elbows
and
twisting
one
leg
about
the
other
in
a
restful
attitude
proceeded
to
open
up
a
conversation
upon
various
topics
of
interest
to
his
mind
dick
was
harum
confidential
henchman
and
factotum
although
not
regularly
so
employed
his
chief
object
in
life
was
apparently
to
get
as
much
amusement
as
possible
out
of
that
experience
and
he
was
quite
unhampered
by
notions
of
delicacy
or
bashfulness
but
withal
larrabee
was
a
very
honest
and
loyal
person
strong
in
his
likes
and
dislikes
devoted
to
david
for
whom
he
had
the
greatest
admiration
and
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
our
friend
stoutly
maintaining
that
he
no
more
you
be
only
as
he
remarked
to
bill
perkins
he
hai
had
the
advantigis
of
your
bringin
up
after
some
preliminary
talk
say
he
said
to
john
got
stuck
with
any
more
countyfit
money
lately
john
face
reddened
a
little
and
dick
laughed
the
old
man
told
me
about
it
he
said
say
you
ought
to
done
as
he
told
ye
to
you
saved
fifteen
dollars
dick
declared
looking
at
our
friend
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
amusement
i
do
quite
understand
said
john
rather
stiffly
did
he
tell
ye
to
charge
up
to
the
bank
an
let
him
take
asked
dick
well
said
john
shortly
oh
yes
i
know
said
larrabee
he
said
sumpthin
to
make
you
think
he
was
goin
to
pass
out
an
you
did
give
him
no
show
to
explain
but
jest
marched
into
the
back
room
an
stuck
onto
the
fire
ho
ho
ho
ho
he
told
me
all
about
it
cried
dick
say
he
declared
i
dunno
i
ever
see
the
old
man
more
kind
o
over
anythin
why
he
would
no
more
passed
them
bills
cut
his
hand
off
he
he
he
he
he
was
jest
ticklin
your
heels
a
little
said
larrabee
to
see
if
you
kick
an
chuckled
the
speaker
you
did
perhaps
i
acted
rather
hastily
said
john
laughing
a
little
from
contagion
said
dick
dave
got
ways
of
his
own
i
summered
wintered
with
him
now
for
a
good
many
years
an
ai
got
to
the
bottom
of
him
yet
an
he
added
i
do
know
nobody
that
has
chapter
xxix
although
as
time
went
on
and
john
had
come
to
a
better
insight
of
the
character
of
the
eccentric
person
whom
dick
had
failed
to
fathom
his
prejudices
had
fallen
away
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
ofttimes
found
him
a
good
deal
of
a
puzzle
the
domains
of
the
serious
and
the
facetious
in
david
mind
seemed
to
have
no
very
well
defined
boundaries
the
talk
had
drifted
back
to
the
people
and
gossip
of
homeville
but
sooth
to
say
it
had
not
on
this
occasion
got
far
away
from
those
topics
yes
said
harum
alf
verjoos
is
on
the
hull
the
best
off
of
any
of
the
lot
as
i
told
ye
he
made
money
on
top
of
what
the
old
man
left
him
an
he
married
money
the
some
on
comes
here
in
the
summer
an
he
here
part
o
the
time
but
the
women
folks
wo
stay
here
winters
an
the
house
is
left
in
care
of
alf
sister
who
never
got
married
he
do
care
a
hill
o
white
beans
fer
anything
in
homeville
but
the
old
place
and
he

to
some
extent
in
that
respect
was
the
reply
she
dark
complected
like
him
but
she
a
mighty
girl
notwithstandin

harum
an
great
fer

up
in
the

john
laughed
outright
while
david
leaned
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
looking
at
him
with
a
broad
though
somewhat
doubtful
smile
that
being
your
feeling
remarked
john
i
should
think
saddle
horses

be
rather
out
of

it
a
saddle
horse
that
the
misses
verjoos
were
interested
in

to
some
extent
fer
a
number
o
years
said
harum
reflectively
but
that
transaction
got
a
peg
all
to
itself
john
laughed
and
asked
how
did
it
come
out
i
mean
what
sort
of
an
interview
did
you
have
with
the
young
woman
father
the
popular

an
come
into
the
back

here
an
after
we

opinion
upon

value
if
i

he
says

any
material
however
because
i
am
quite
in

within

within
limits
he
says
that
kind
o
riled
me
remarked
david
i
see
in
a
minute
what
was
passin
in
his
mind
i
says
verjoos
i
guess
the
fact
the
matter
is
i
about
as
much
in
the
mud
as
you
be
in
the
mire
your
daughter
got

i
says
i

no

sir
he
says
bein
meant
none
will
be
took
i
says
i
says
i
was
offered
fer
that
hoss
day
before
yestidy
an
take
it
i
ca

i
i

but
if
you

like
drawin
your
check

a
deal
the
speaker
paused
with
a
chuckle
well
said
john
said
david
he
he
he
he
that
clean
took
the
wind
out
of
him
an
he
got
redder
a
beet

no
less
an
i
got

out
o
my

he
say
then
asked
john
replied
harum
he
settled
his
neck
down
into
his
collar
an
necktie
an
cleared
his
throat
a
few
times
an
says
put
me
in
ruther
an
embarrassin
position
harum
my
daughter
has
set
her
heart
on
the
hoss
an
with
a
kind
of
a
smile
like
a
wrinkle
in
a
boot
ca
very
well
tell
her
that
i
would
buy
him
because
you
would
accept
a
higher
offer
than
your
own
price
i
i
think
i
must
accede
to
your
proposition
an
accept
the
favor
he
says
draggin
the
words
out
by
the
roots
favor
at

many
that

an
a
cross
dog
under

wagin
as

an
you
tell
her
if

i
says
if

anythin
more
out
o

i
throw

dollars
time
if

her
own
buyin
said
harum
i
did
know
but
what
he
gag
a
little
at
that
but
he
did
seem
to
an
when
he
went
off
after
givin
me
his
check
he
put
out
his
hand
an
shook
hands
a
thing
he
never
done
before
that
was
really
very
amusing
was
john
comment
a
bad
day
work
either
observed
harum
i
sold
the
crowd
a
good
many
hosses
since
then
an
i
laughed
a
thousan
times
over
that
trade
me
miss
claricy
he
added
has
alwus
ben
good
friends
sence
that
time
an
she
polly

mr
an
i
say
that
ole
hoss
wore
out
yet
or
you
to
run
off
with
another
hoss
i
say
at
this
point
david
got
out
of
his
chair
yawned
and
walked
over
to
the
window
did
you
ever
in
all
your
born
days
he
said
see
such
dum
weather
jest
look
out
there
no
sleighin
no
wheelin
an
a
barn
full
exercise
i
guess
i
be
moseyin
along
and
out
he
went
chapter
xxx
if
john
lenox
had
kept
a
diary
for
the
first
year
of
his
life
in
homeville
most
of
its
pages
would
have
been
blank
the
daily
routine
of
the
office
he
had
no
assistant
but
the
callow
hopkins
was
more
exacting
than
laborious
but
it
kept
him
confined
seven
hours
in
the
still
there
was
time
in
the
lengthened
days
as
the
year
advanced
for
walking
rowing
and
riding
or
driving
about
the
picturesque
country
which
surrounds
homeville
he
and
harum
often
drove
together
after
the
bank
closed
or
after
tea
and
it
was
a
pleasure
in
itself
to
observe
david
dexterous
handling
of
his
horses
and
his
content
and
satisfaction
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
favorite
pastime
in
pursuit
of
business
he
jogged
as
he
said
behind
the
faithful
jinny
but
when
on
pleasure
bent
a
pair
of
trotters
drew
him
in
the
latest
and
slickest
model
of
of
course
he
said
i
ruther
ride
all
alone
than
not
to
ride
at
all
but
the
twice
as
much
fun
i
when
you
got
somebody
along
i
ai
much
of
a
talker
unless
i
happen
to
git
started
at
which
assertion
john
repressed
a
smile
but
once
in
a
while
i
like
to
have
somebody
to
say
somethin
to
you
like
to
come
along
do
ye
very
much
indeed
i
used
to
git
polly
to
come
once
in
a
while
said
david
but
it
no
pleasure
to
her
she
had
never
ben
used
to
hosses
an
alwus
set
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
ready
to
jump
an
if
one
o
the
critters
capered
a
little
she
want
to
git
right
out
then
an
there
i
reckon
she
never
went
out
but
what
she
thanked
mercy
when
she
struck
the
hoss
block
to
git
back
with
hull
bones
i
should
have
thought
that
she
would
have
been
nervous
with
the
reins
in
your
hands
said
john
replied
david
the
last
time
she
come
along
somethin
give
the
team
a
little
scare
an
she
reached
over
an
made
a
grab
at
the
lines
that
he
remarked
with
a
grin
was
quite
a
good
while
ago
i
says
to
her
when
we
got
home
guess
after
this
you
better
take
your
on
a
you
wo
be
so
liable
to
git
run
away
with
an
throwed
out
i
says
john
laughed
a
little
but
made
no
comment
after
all
said
david
i
dunno
i
blamed
her
fer
bein
skittish
but
i
could
have
her
grabbin
the
lines
it
curi
he
reflected
i
did
used
to
mind
what
i
rode
behind
nor
who
done
the
drivin
but
i
have
to
admit
that
as
i
git
older
i
prefer
to
do
it
myself
i
ride
once
in
a
while
with
fellers
that
drive
as
well
an
mebbe
better
i
can
an
i
know
it
but
if
anythin
turns
up
or
looks
like
it
i
ca
help
wishin
i
had
holt
o
the
lines
myself
the
two
passed
a
good
many
hours
together
thus
beguiling
the
time
whatever
david
other
merits
as
a
companion
he
was
not
exacting
of
response
when
engaged
in
conversation
and
rarely
made
any
demands
upon
his
auditor
during
that
first
year
john
made
few
additions
to
his
social
acquaintance
and
if
in
the
summer
the
sight
of
a
gay
party
of
young
people
caused
some
stirrings
in
his
breast
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
induce
him
to
make
any
attempts
toward
the
acquaintance
which
he
might
have
formed
he
was
often
conscious
of
glances
of
curiosity
directed
toward
himself
and
euston
was
asked
a
good
many
questions
about
the
latest
addition
to
his
congregation
yes
he
had
called
upon
lenox
and
his
call
had
been
returned
in
fact
they
had
had
several
visits
together
had
met
out
walking
once
and
had
gone
on
in
company
was
lenox
nice
yes
he
had
made
a
pleasant
impression
upon
euston
and
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
intelligence
and
good
breeding
very
gentlemanlike
why
did
not
people
know
him
well
euston
had
made
some
proffers
to
that
end
but
lenox
had
merely
expressed
his
thanks
no
euston
did
not
know
how
he
happened
to
be
in
homeville
and
employed
by
that
queer
old
harum
and
living
with
him
and
his
funny
old
sister
lenox
had
not
confided
in
him
at
all
and
though
very
civil
and
pleasant
did
not
appear
to
wish
to
be
communicative
so
our
friend
did
not
make
his
entrance
that
season
into
the
drawing
or
dining
rooms
of
any
of
what
david
called
the
nabobs
houses
by
the
middle
or
latter
part
of
october
homeville
was
deserted
of
its
visitors
and
as
many
of
that
class
of
its
regular
population
as
had
the
means
to
go
with
and
a
place
to
go
to
it
was
under
somewhat
different
auspices
that
john
entered
upon
the
second
winter
of
his
sojourn
it
has
been
made
plain
that
his
relations
with
his
employer
and
the
kind
and
lovable
polly
were
on
a
satisfactory
and
permanent
footing
i
dum
said
david
to
dick
larrabee
if
it
hai
got
putty
near
to
the
when
if
i
want
to
git
anythin
out
o
the
common
run
out
polly
i
have
to
ask
john
to
fix
it
fer
me
she
like
a
cow
with
a
calf
he
declared
david
sets
all
the
store
in
the
world
by
him
stated
bixbee
to
a
friend
though
he
do
jest
let
on
to
not
in
so
many
words
he
got
a
kind
of
a
notion
that
his
little
boy
if
he
lived
would
ben
like
him
some
ways
i
never
seen
the
child
she
added
with
an
expression
which
made
her
visitor
smile
but
as
near
i
make
out
f
dave
tell
he
must
ben
did
you
know
ever
ben
married
he
was
fer
a
few
years
though
it
the
one
thing
i
do
mean
that
it
o
the
things
he
do
have
much
to
say
about
but
once
in
a
while
he
talk
about
the
boy
what
he
be
now
if
he
lived
an
so
on
an
he
the
greatest
hand
fer
childern
pickin
on
up
when
he
ridin
and
such
as
that
an
i
seen
him
once
when
we
was
travelin
on
the
cars
go
an
take
a
squawlin
baby
away
f
it
mother
who
looked
ready
to
drop
an
lay
it
across
that
big
chest
of
his
an
the
little
thing
never
gave
a
whimper
after
he
got
it
into
his
arms
jest
went
right
off
to
sleep
no
said
bixbee
i
never
had
no
childern
an
i
know
but
what
i
was
glad
of
it
at
the
time
jim
bixbee
was
about
as
much
baby
as
i
thought
i
could
manage
but
now
there
was
some
reason
for
not
concluding
the
sentence
and
so
we
do
not
know
what
was
in
her
mind
chapter
xxxi
the
year
that
had
passed
had
seemed
a
very
long
one
to
john
but
as
the
months
came
and
went
he
had
in
a
measure
adjusted
himself
to
the
change
in
his
fortunes
and
environment
and
so
as
time
went
on
the
poignancy
of
his
sorrow
and
regret
diminished
as
it
does
with
all
of
us
yet
the
sight
of
a
man
still
brought
a
pang
to
his
heart
and
there
were
times
of
yearning
longing
to
recall
every
line
of
the
face
every
detail
of
the
dress
the
voice
the
words
of
the
girl
who
had
been
so
dear
to
him
and
who
had
gone
out
of
his
life
as
irrevocably
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
by
death
itself
it
may
be
strange
but
it
is
true
that
for
a
very
long
time
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
communicate
with
her
by
mailing
a
letter
to
her
new
york
address
to
be
forwarded
and
when
the
thought
came
to
him
the
impulse
to
act
upon
it
was
very
strong
but
he
did
not
do
so
perhaps
he
would
have
written
had
he
been
less
in
love
with
her
but
also
there
was
mingled
with
that
sentiment
something
of
bitterness
which
though
he
could
not
quite
explain
or
justify
it
did
exist
then
too
he
said
to
himself
of
what
avail
would
it
be
only
to
keep
alive
a
longing
for
the
impossible
no
he
would
forget
it
all
men
had
died
and
worms
had
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
many
men
lived
all
their
lives
without
it
and
got
on
very
well
too
he
was
aware
perhaps
some
day
when
he
had
become
thoroughly
affiliated
and
localized
he
would
wed
a
village
maiden
and
rear
a
freeland
county
brood
our
friend
as
may
be
seen
had
a
pretty
healthy
mind
and
we
need
not
sympathize
with
him
to
the
disturbance
of
our
own
peace
books
accumulated
in
the
best
bedroom
john
expenses
were
small
and
there
was
very
little
temptation
or
indeed
opportunity
for
spending
at
the
time
of
his
taking
possession
of
his
quarters
in
david
house
he
had
raised
the
question
of
his
contribution
to
the
household
expenses
but
harum
had
declined
to
discuss
the
matter
at
all
and
referred
him
to
bixbee
with
whom
he
compromised
on
a
weekly
sum
which
appeared
to
him
absurdly
small
but
which
she
protested
she
was
ashamed
to
accept
after
a
while
a
small
upright
piano
made
its
appearance
with
aunt
polly
approval
why
of
course
she
said
you
need
to
hev
ast
me
i
like
to
hev
you
anyway
i
like
music
ever
so
much
an
so
does
david
though
i
guess
it
would
floor
him
to
try
an
raise
a
tune
i
used
to
sing
quite
a
little
when
i
was
younger
an
i
help
at
church
an
prayer
meetin
now
why
why
not
when
would
you
play
if
it
in
the
evenin
david
sleeps
over
the
wing
do
you
hear
him
snore
hardly
ever
replied
john
smiling
that
is
to
say
not
very
much
just
enough
sometimes
to
know
that
he
is
asleep
she
said
decidedly
if
he
fur
enough
off
so
you
hear
i
guess
he
wo
hear
much
an
he
sure
wo
hear
you
after
he
gits
to
sleep
so
the
piano
came
and
was
a
great
comfort
and
resource
indeed
before
long
it
became
the
regular
order
of
things
for
david
and
his
sister
to
spend
an
hour
or
so
on
sunday
evenings
listening
to
his
music
and
their
own
as
well
that
is
the
music
of
their
choice
which
latter
was
mostly
to
be
found
in
carmina
sacra
and
moody
and
sankey
and
aunt
heart
was
glad
indeed
when
she
and
john
together
made
concord
of
sweet
sounds
in
some
familiar
hymn
tune
to
the
great
edification
of
harum
whose
admiration
was
unbounded
did
i
tell
you
said
david
to
dick
larrabee
what
happened
the
last
time
me
an
john
went
ridin
together
not
i
remember
on
replied
dick
we
rode
together
quite
a
said
harum
but
i
had
never
said
anythin
to
him
about
takin
a
turn
at
the
lines
this
day
we
got
a
piece
out
into
the
country
an
i
had
the
brown
colts
i
says
to
him

any
drivin
or
less
he
says
to
take
the
lines
fer
a
spell
i
says
he
says
lookin
kind
o
pleased
you
ai
afraid
to
trust
me
with
he
says
i
be
here
i
says
an
handed
over
sir
i
see
jest
by
the
way
he
took
holt
on
it
the
fust
time
an
we
went
along
to
where
the
road
turns
in
through
a
piece
of
woods
an
the
track
is
narrer
an
we
run
slap
onto
one
o
them
dum
that
had
got
putty
near
square
across
the
track
now
i
tell
ye
said
harum
them
hosses

like
it
fer
a
cent
an
tell
the
truth
i
did
like
it
no
better
we
could
go
ahead
fer
we

the
cussed

the
other
the
was
half
a
minute
when
i
have
sold
out
mighty
cheap
an
took
a
promise
fer
the
money

to
drive
any
team

barn
said
david
feeling
in
which
view
larrabee
shared
that
encomium
was
pretty
well
exhausted
in
that
assertion
i
do
believe
said
harum
after
a
moment
in
which
he
and
his
companion
reflected
upon
the
gravity
of
his
last
declaration
that
the
any
dum
thing
that
feller
ca
do
the
last
thing
a
piany

chapter
xxxii
our
friend
acquaintance
with
the
rector
of
james
church
had
grown
into
something
like
friendship
and
the
two
men
were
quite
often
together
in
the
evening
john
went
sometimes
to
euston
house
and
not
unfrequently
the
latter
would
spend
an
hour
in
john
room
over
a
cigar
and
a
chat
on
one
of
the
latter
occasions
late
in
the
autumn
euston
went
to
the
piano
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
and
looked
over
some
of
the
music
among
which
were
two
or
three
hymnals
you
are
musical
he
said
in
a
modest
way
was
the
reply
i
am
very
fond
of
it
said
the
clergyman
but
have
little
knowledge
of
it
i
wish
i
had
more
he
added
in
a
tone
of
so
much
regret
as
to
cause
his
hearer
to
look
curiously
at
him
yes
he
said
i
wish
i
knew
more
or
less
it
the
bane
of
my
existence
declared
the
rector
with
a
half
laugh
john
looked
inquiringly
at
him
but
did
not
respond
i
mean
the
music
so
called
at
james
said
euston
i
wonder
you
smile
he
remarked
but
it
not
a
matter
for
smiling
with
me
i
beg
pardon
said
john
no
you
need
not
returned
the
other
but
really
well
there
are
a
good
many
unpleasant
and
disheartening
experiences
in
a
life
and
i
can
i
hope
face
and
endure
most
of
them
with
patience
but
the
musical
part
of
my
service
is
a
source
of
anxiety
perplexity
and
annoyance
i
think
said
euston
that
i
expend
more
nerve
tissue
upon
that
branch
of
my
responsibilities
than
upon
all
the
rest
of
my
work
you
see
we
can
not
afford
to
pay
any
of
the
singers
and
indeed
my
people
some
of
them
at
least
think
fifty
dollars
is
a
great
sum
for
poor
little
miss
knapp
the
organist
the
rest
are
volunteers
or
rather
i
should
say
have
been
pressed
into
the
service
we
are
supposed
to
have
two
sopranos
and
two
altos
but
in
effect
it
happens
sometimes
that
neither
of
a
pair
will
appear
each
expecting
the
other
to
be
on
duty
the
tenor
hubber
who
is
an
elderly
man
without
any
voice
to
speak
of
but
a
very
devout
and
faithful
churchman
is
to
be
depended
upon
to
the
extent
of
his
abilities
but
little
the
bass
well
observed
euston
the
less
said
about
him
the
better
how
about
the
organist
said
john
i
think
she
does
very
well
does
she
miss
knapp
is
the
one
redeeming
feature
replied
the
rector
but
she
has
not
much
courage
to
interfere
hubber
is
nominally
the
leader
but
he
knows
little
of
music
euston
gave
a
sorry
little
laugh
trying
enough
he
said
one
sunday
with
another
but
on
christmas
and
easter
when
my
people
make
an
unusual
effort
and
attempt
the
impossible
it
is
something
deplorable
john
could
not
forbear
a
little
laugh
i
should
think
it
must
be
pretty
trying
he
said
it
is
simply
corroding
declared
euston
they
sat
for
a
while
smoking
in
silence
the
contemplation
of
his
woes
having
apparently
driven
other
topics
from
the
mind
of
the
harassed
clergyman
at
last
he
said
turning
to
our
friend
i
have
heard
your
voice
in
church
yes
and
i
noticed
that
you
sang
not
only
the
hymns
but
the
chants
and
in
a
way
to
suggest
the
idea
that
you
have
had
experience
and
training
i
did
not
come
here
for
the
purpose
said
euston
after
waiting
a
moment
for
john
to
speak
though
i
confess
the
idea
has
occurred
to
me
before
but
it
was
suggested
again
by
the
sight
of
your
piano
and
music
i
know
that
it
is
asking
a
great
deal
he
continued
but
do
you
think
you
could
undertake
for
a
while
at
least
to
help
such
a
lame
dog
as
i
am
over
the
stile
you
have
no
idea
said
the
rector
earnestly
what
a
service
you
would
be
doing
not
only
to
me
but
to
my
people
and
the
church
john
pulled
thoughtfully
at
his
mustache
for
a
moment
while
euston
watched
his
face
i
do
know
he
said
at
last
in
a
doubtful
tone
i
am
afraid
you
are
taking
too
much
for
granted
i
do
mean
as
to
my
good
will
but
as
to
my
ability
to
be
of
service
for
i
suppose
you
mean
that
i
should
help
in
drilling
your
choir
yes
replied
euston
i
suppose
it
would
be
too
much
to
ask
you
to
sing
as
well
i
have
had
no
experience
in
the
way
of
leading
or
directing
replied
john
ignoring
the
suggestion
though
i
have
sung
in
church
more
or
less
and
am
familiar
with
the
service
but
even
admitting
my
ability
to
be
of
use
should
you
be
afraid
that
my
interposing
might
make
more
trouble
than
it
would
help
would
your
choir
resent
it
such
people
are
sometimes
jealous
you
know
oh
dear
yes
sighed
the
rector
but
he
added
i
think
i
can
guarantee
that
there
will
be
no
unpleasant
feeling
either
toward
you
or
about
you
your
being
from
new
york
will
give
you
a
certain
prestige
and
their
curiosity
and
the
element
of
novelty
will
make
the
beginning
easy
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
harum
appeared
but
seeing
a
visitor
was
for
withdrawing
do
go
said
john
come
in
of
course
you
know
mr
euston
glad
to
see
ye
said
david
advancing
and
shaking
hands
you
folks
talkin
he
asked
before
sitting
down
i
am
trying
to
persuade
lenox
to
do
me
a
great
favor
said
euston
well
i
guess
he
wo
want
such
an
awful
sight
o
persuadin
said
david
taking
a
chair
if
he
able
to
do
it
what
does
he
want
of
ye
he
asked
turning
to
john
euston
explained
and
our
friend
gave
his
reasons
for
hesitating
all
but
the
chief
one
which
was
that
he
was
reluctant
to
commit
himself
to
an
undertaking
which
he
apprehended
would
be
not
only
laborious
but
disagreeable
said
david
as
fur
the
itself
concerned
the
hull
thing
all
to
me
but
as
fur
gettin
folks
to
come
an
sing
you
git
a
barn
full
an
take
your
pick
an
a
feller
that
git
a
pair
of
hosses
an
a
buggy
out
of
a
tight
fix
the
way
you
done
a
while
ago
ought
to
be
able
to
break
in
a
little
team
of
half
a
dozen
women
or
so
well
said
john
laughing
could
have
done
what
i
was
lucky
enough
to
do
with
the
horses
but
yes
yes
david
broke
in
scratching
his
cheek
i
guess
you
got
me
that
time
euston
perceived
that
for
some
reason
he
had
an
ally
and
advocate
in
harum
he
rose
and
said
and
john
escorted
him
downstairs
to
the
door
pray
think
of
it
as
favorably
as
you
can
he
said
as
they
shook
hands
at
parting
putty
nice
kind
of
a
man
remarked
david
when
john
came
back
putty
nice
kind
of
a
man
the
only
you
made
of
his
kind
ai
he
he
all
right
fur
he
goes
comes
of
good
stock
told
an
looks
it
runs
a
good
deal
to
emptins
in
his
preachin
though
they
say
how
do
you
find
him
i
think
i
enjoy
his
conversation
more
than
his
sermons
admitted
john
with
a
smile
less
of
it
at
times
ai
the
suggested
david
i
may
have
told
ye
he
continued
that
i
a
very
churchgoer
but
ben
more
or
less
in
my
time
an
when
i
did
listen
to
the
sermon
all
through
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
preacher
put
all
really
was
in
it
together
he
would
need
to
have
took
only
quarter
the
time
but
what
with
scorin
fer
a
start
an
laggin
on
the
back
stretch
an
now
an
then
breakin
to
a
i
wanted
to
come
down
out
o
the
stand
before
the
race
was
over
the
a
good
many
fast
quarter
hosses
remarked
harum
but
them
that
keep
it
up
fer
a
full
mile
is
scurce
what
you
goin
to
do
about
the
music
or
hai
ye
made
up
your
mind
yet
he
asked
changing
the
subject
i
like
euston
said
john
and
he
seems
very
much
in
earnest
about
this
matter
but
i
am
not
sure
he
added
thoughtfully
that
i
can
do
what
he
wants
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
very
reluctant
to
undertake
it
still
i
do
know
but
that
i
ought
to
make
the
trial
and
he
looked
up
at
david
i
guess
i
would
if
i
was
you
said
the
latter
it
ca
do
ye
no
harm
an
it
may
do
ye
some
good
the
fact
is
he
continued
that
you
ai
out
o
danger
of
runnin
in
a
rut
it
would
do
you
good
mebbe
to
git
more
acquainted
an
mebbe
this
be
the
start
o
with
a
little
team
of
half
a
dozen
women
as
you
called
them
said
john
euston
has
offered
to
introduce
me
to
any
one
i
cared
to
know
i
did
mean
the
singin
folks
responded
harum
i
meant
the
church
folks
in
an
it
come
in
a
sort
of
way
not
like
bein
took
by
euston
as
if
you
him
to
you
ca
git
along
you
may
an
have
fer
a
spell
but
not
alwus
with
nobody
to
visit
with
but
me
an
polly
an
dick
an
so
on
an
once
in
a
while
with
the
parson
you
ben
used
to
somethin
an
while
i
ai
sayin
that
homeville
in
the
winter
the
finest
in
the
land
or
that
me
an
polly
ai
all
right
in
our
way
you
want
a
change
o
feed
once
in
a
while
or
you
git
the
colic
now
proceeded
the
speaker
if
this
singin
do
do
to
give
ye
somethin
new
to
think
about
an
take
up
an
evenin
now
then
even
if
it
bothers
ye
some
i
think
mebbe
it
be
a
good
thing
fer
ye
they
say
a
reasonable
amount
o
fleas
is
good
fer
a
dog
keeps
him
from
broodin
over
a
dog
mebbe
suggested
david
perhaps
you
are
right
said
john
indeed
i
do
doubt
that
you
are
right
and
i
will
take
your
advice
thank
you
said
david
a
minute
or
two
later
on
holding
out
the
glass
while
john
poured
jest
a
wisdom
toothful
i
do
set
up
to
be
no
an
if
you
ever
find
out
how
i
bettin
on
a
race
jest
me
an
you
wear
but
i
know
when
a
hoss
has
stood
too
long
in
the
barn
as
soon
as
the
next
man
it
is
possible
that
even
euston
did
not
fully
appreciate
the
difficulties
of
the
task
which
he
persuaded
our
friend
john
to
undertake
and
it
is
certain
that
had
the
latter
known
all
that
they
were
to
be
he
would
have
hardened
his
heart
against
both
the
pleadings
of
the
rector
and
the
advice
of
david
his
efforts
were
welcomed
and
seconded
by
hubber
the
tenor
and
miss
knapp
the
organist
and
there
was
some
earnestness
displayed
at
first
by
the
ladies
of
the
choir
but
little
the
bass
proved
a
hopeless
case
and
john
wholly
against
his
intentions
and
his
inclinations
as
well
had
eventually
to
take
over
the
basso
duty
altogether
as
being
the
easiest
way
in
fact
the
only
way
to
save
his
efforts
from
downright
failure
without
going
in
detail
into
the
trials
and
tribulations
incident
to
the
bringing
of
the
musical
part
of
the
service
at
euston
church
up
to
a
respectable
if
not
a
high
standard
it
may
be
said
that
with
unremitting
pains
this
end
was
accomplished
to
the
boundless
relief
and
gratitude
of
that
worthy
gentleman
and
to
a
good
degree
of
the
members
of
his
congregation
chapter
xxxiii
on
a
fine
sunday
in
summer
after
the
close
of
the
service
the
exit
of
the
congregation
of
james
church
presents
an
animated
and
inspiring
spectacle
a
good
many
ladies
of
various
ages
and
not
quite
so
many
men
mostly
as
david
would
have
put
it
runnin
a
little
younger
come
from
out
the
sacred
edifice
with
an
expression
of
relief
easily
changeable
to
something
gayer
a
few
drive
away
in
handsome
equipages
but
most
prefer
to
walk
and
there
is
usually
a
good
deal
of
smiling
talk
in
groups
before
parting
in
which
euston
likes
to
join
he
leaves
matters
in
the
vestry
to
the
care
of
old
barlow
the
sexton
and
makes
if
one
may
be
permitted
the
expression
a
quick
change
things
had
come
about
very
much
as
david
had
desired
and
anticipated
and
our
friend
had
met
quite
a
number
of
the
summer
people
having
been
waylaid
at
times
by
the
rector
in
whose
good
graces
he
stood
so
high
that
he
might
have
sung
anything
short
of
a
comic
song
during
the
offertory
and
presented
on
this
particular
sunday
he
had
lingered
a
while
in
the
gallery
after
service
over
some
matter
connected
with
the
music
and
when
he
came
out
of
the
church
most
of
the
people
had
made
their
way
down
the
front
steps
and
up
the
street
but
standing
near
the
gate
was
a
group
of
three
the
rector
and
two
young
women
whom
john
had
seen
the
previous
summer
and
now
recognized
as
the
misses
verjoos
he
raised
his
hat
as
he
was
passing
the
group
when
euston
detained
him
i
want
to
present
you
to
the
misses
verjoos
a
tall
girl
dressed
in
some
black
material
which
gave
john
the
impression
of
lace
recognized
his
salutation
with
a
slight
bow
and
a
rather
indifferent
survey
from
a
pair
of
very
somber
dark
eyes
while
her
sister
in
light
colors
gave
him
a
smiling
glance
from
a
pair
of
very
blue
ones
and
rather
to
his
surprise
put
out
her
hand
with
the
usual
declaration
of
pleasure
happiness
or
what
not
we
were
just
speaking
of
the
singing
said
the
rector
and
i
was
saying
that
it
was
all
your
doing
you
really
have
done
wonders
condescended
she
of
the
somber
eyes
we
have
only
been
here
a
day
or
two
and
this
is
the
first
time
we
have
been
at
church
the
party
moved
out
of
the
gate
and
up
the
street
the
rector
leading
with
miss
verjoos
followed
by
our
friend
and
the
younger
sister
indeed
you
have
said
the
latter
seconding
her
sister
remark
i
do
believe
even
yourself
can
quite
realize
what
the
difference
is
my
it
is
very
nice
for
the
rest
of
us
but
it
must
be
a
perfect
killing
bore
for
you
i
have
found
it
rather
trying
at
times
said
john
but
now
you
are
so
kind
it
is
beginning
to
appear
to
me
as
the
most
delightful
of
pursuits
very
pretty
remarked
miss
clara
do
you
say
a
good
deal
of
that
sort
of
thing
i
am
rather
out
of
practice
replied
john
i
have
had
much
opportunity
for
some
time
i
do
think
you
need
feel
discouraged
she
returned
a
good
method
is
everything
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
might
soon
be
in
form
again
thanks
for
your
encouragement
said
john
smiling
i
was
beginning
to
feel
quite
low
in
my
mind
about
it
she
laughed
a
little
i
heard
quite
a
good
deal
about
you
last
year
from
a
very
good
friend
of
yours
said
miss
clara
after
a
pause
john
looked
at
her
inquiringly
bixbee
she
said
is
she
an
old
dear
i
have
reason
to
think
so
with
all
my
heart
said
john
stoutly
she
talked
a
lot
about
you
to
me
said
miss
clara
yes
yes
and
if
your
ears
did
not
burn
you
have
no
sense
of
gratitude
is
harum
funny
i
have
sometimes
suspected
it
said
john
laughing
he
once
told
me
rather
an
amusing
thing
about
a
young
woman
running
off
with
one
of
his
horses
did
he
tell
you
that
really
i
wonder
what
you
must
have
thought
of
me
something
of
what
harum
did
i
fancy
said
john
what
was
that
pardon
me
was
the
reply
but
i
have
been
snubbed
once
this
morning
she
gave
a
little
laugh
harum
and
i
are
great
as
he
says
is
a
nice
word
she
asked
looking
at
her
companion
i
should
think
so
if
i
were
in
harum
place
said
john
it
means
i
believe
in
his
dictionary
they
had
come
to
where
freeland
street
terminates
in
the
lake
road
which
follows
the
border
of
the
lake
to
the
north
and
winds
around
the
foot
of
it
to
the
south
and
west
why
exclaimed
miss
clara
there
comes
david
i
have
seen
him
this
summer
they
halted
and
david
drew
up
winding
the
reins
about
the
whipstock
and
pulling
off
his
buckskin
glove
how
do
you
do
mr
harum
said
the
girl
putting
her
hand
in
his
how
air
ye
miss
claricy
glad
to
see

agin
he
said
i
up
a
little
day
now
an
you
do
look
as
if
you
was
off
your
feed
much
eh
no
she
replied
laughing
i
in
what
you
call
pretty
fair
condition
i
think
i
reckon
he
said
looking
at
her
smiling
face
with
the
frankest
admiration
guess
you
come
out
a
little
finer
season
do
ye
hard
work
to
keep

o
the
class
i
guess

she
replied
that
right
said
david
how

bixbee

inquired
said
david
with
a
grin
i

little

the
mouth
lately
polly

to
be
fallin
away
some

miss
clara
only

at
this
gloomy
report
how

horse

she
asked

david
chuckling

an
i
send

up
in
the
mornin
he
looked
from
miss
clara
to
john
whose
salutation
he
had
acknowledged
with
the
briefest
of
nods
how
you
ketch
he
asked
indicating
our
friend
with
a
motion
of
his
head
had
to
go
after
him
with
a
measure
did
ye
or
did
he
let
ye
corner
him
euston
caught
him
for
me
she
said
laughing
but
coloring
perceptibly
while
john
face
grew
very
red
i
think
i
will
run
on
and
join
my
sister
and
lenox

drive

she
said
to
john
cordially
whenever
you
can
come
and
taking
her
prayer
book
and
hymnal
from
him
she
sped
away
look
at
her
git
over
the
ground
said
david
turning
to
watch
her
while
john
got
into
the
buggy
ai
that
a
gait
she
is
a
charming
girl
said
john
as
old
jinny
started
off
she
the
one
i
told
you
about
that
run
off
with
my
hoss
remarked
david
an
i
alwus
look
after
him
fer
her
in
the
winter
yes
i

said
john
she
was
laughing
about
it
and
saying
that
you
and
she
were
great
friends
she
was
was
she
said
david
highly

scat

if
i
was
thirty
years
younger
she
c

as
easy
an
i
dunno
but
what
she
could
anyway
he
added
charming
girl
repeated
john
rather
thoughtfully
said
david
i
do
know
as
much
about
girls
as
i
do
about
some
things
my
experience
hai
laid
much
in
that
line
but
i
like
to
take
a
contract
to
match
on
any
i
guess
he
added
softly
that
the
consideration
in
that
deal
have
to
be
an
affection
git
up
old
lady
he
exclaimed
and
drew
the
whip
along
old
jinny
back
like
a
caress
the
mare
quickened
her
pace
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
drove
into
the
barn
chapter
xxxiv
where
you
ben
asked
bixbee
of
her
brother
as
the
three
sat
at
the
one
dinner
i

off
somewheres
ben
up
the
lake
road

david
he
got
a
hoss
i
some
notion
o
buyin
ai
the
enough
she
asked
to
do
your
in
breakin
the
sabbath
david
threw
back
his
head
and
lowered
a
stalk
of
the
last
asparagus
of
the
year
into
his
mouth
some
o
the
best
deals
i
ever
made
he
said

made
on
a
sunday
hai
you

i
noticed
that
folks
who
was
of
your
way
o
thinkin
never
made
no
mistakes
an
a
very
consistent
believer
whereupon
he
laughed
in
a
way
to
arouse
both
bixbee
curiosity
and
suspicion

to

it
if

at

the
way
he
wriggled

its
weight
in

david

declared
aunt
polly

ort
to
be
yourself
said
david
with
an
air
of
meekness
if
i
done
anythin
sorry
for
i
willin
to
be
now
i
heard
enough
fer
one
day
said
bixbee
decisively
unless
it
you
finish
your
dinner
sairy
git
through
her
work
sometime
chapter
xxxv
after
dinner
john
went
to
his
room
and
david
and
his
sister
seated
themselves
on
the
verandy
harum
lighted
a
cigar
and
enjoyed
his
tobacco
for
a
time
in
silence
while
bixbee
perused
with
rather
perfunctory
diligence
the
columns
of
her
weekly
church
paper
i
seen
a
sight
fer
sore
eyes
this
mornin
quoth
david
presently
what
was
that
asked
aunt
polly
looking
up
over
her
glasses
claricy
verjoos
fer
one
part
o
said
david
the
verjooses
hev
come
hev
they
that
good
i
hope
come
up
an
see
me
david
nodded
an
the
other
part
o
was
he
said
she
an
that
young
feller
of
was
walkin
together
an
a
putty
slick
pair
they
made
too
ai
she
purty
said
bixbee
they
do
make
no
puttier
affirmed
david
an
they
was
a
nice
pair
i
could
help
thinkin
he
remarked
what
a
nice
hitch
up
they
make
guess
the
ai
much
chance
o
that
she
observed
no
i
guess
not
either
said
david
he
hai
got
anythin
to
speak
of
i
an
though
i
reckon
she
hev
some
day
all
that
set
o
folks
seems
to
marry
money
an
some
one
alwus
dyin
an
leavin
some
on
some
more
the
nothin
truer
in
the
bible
declared
bixbee
with
conviction
that
sayin
thet
them
that
has
gits
that
about
the
way
it
runs
in
said
david
it
do
seem
right
said
bixbee
with
her
eyes
on
her
face
now
there
was
all
that
money
one
o
mis
elbert
relations
left
her
last
year
an
lucy
scramm
that
poorer
poverty
back
kitchin
an
the
same
relation
to
him
that
mis
swayne
was
only
got
a
thousan
dollars
an
the
swaynes
rich
already
not
but
what
the
thousan
was
a
godsend
to
the
scramms
but
he
might
jest
as
well
left
off
as
not
of
pilin
more
onto
the
swaynes
that
did
need
it
does
seem
kind
o
tough
david
observed
leaning
forward
to
drop
his
cigar
ash
clear
of
the
veranda
floor
but
that
the
way
things
goes
an
i
often
had
to
notice
that
a
man
sometimes
do
the
foolishist
thing
or
the
meanest
thing
in
his
hull
life
after
he
dead
you
never
told
me
said
bixbee
after
a
minute
or
two
in
which
she
appeared
to
be
following
up
a
train
of
reflection
much
of
about
john
matters
hai
he
ever
told
you
anythin
more
what
you
told
me
or
do
ye
want
me
to
know
did
his
father
leave
anythin
the
was
a
little
money
replied
her
brother
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
an
a
lot
of
unlikely
chances
but
nothin
to
live
on
an
the
nothin
for
but
he
had
to
come
up
here
she
queried
he
had
to
work
on
a
salary
somewhere
i
reckon
was
the
reply
the
was
one
thing
added
david
thoughtfully
after
a
moment
mebbe
come
to
somethin
some
time
but
it
may
be
a
good
while
fust
do
you
ever
let
on
to
him
nor
nobody
else
i
ever
said
about
it
i
wo
open
my
head
to
a
livin
soul
she
declared
what
was
it
i
do
know
i
ever
told
ye
he
said
but
a
good
many
years
ago
i
took
some
little
hand
in
the
oil
but
though
i
did
git
in
as
deep
as
i
wish
now
i
had
i
alwus
kept
up
a
kind
of
in
what
goes
on
in
that
line
no
i
guess
you
never
told
me
she
said
where
you
goin
as
he
got
out
of
his
chair
goin
to
git
my
cap
he
answered
dum
the
dum
things
i
do
believe
the
a
fly
in
freeland
county
that
hai
danced
the
wild
kachuky
on
my
head
sence
we
set
here
be
i
much
specked
he
asked
as
he
bent
his
bald
poll
for
her
inspection
oh
go
she
cried
as
she
gave
him
a
laughing
push
he
resumed
when
he
had
returned
to
his
chair
and
relighted
his
cigar
the
was
a
piece
of
about
ten
or
twelve
hunderd
acres
of
land
down
in
pennsylvany
havin
some
coal
on
it
he
told
me
he
understood
but
all
the
timber
ten
inch
an
over
ben
sold
off
he
told
me
that
his
father
head
clerk
told
him
that
the
old
gentleman
had
tried
fer
a
long
time
to
dispose
of
it
but
it
called
fer
too
much
to
develop
it
i
guess
any
rate
he
could
an
got
it
to
pay
taxes
on
i
should
think
it
was
wuth
anythin
to
him
but
jest
a
bill
of
expense
observed
bixbee
tai
now
said
david
an
mebbe
wo
be
fer
a
good
while
still
it
wuth
somethin
an
i
advised
him
to
hold
onto
it
on
i
do
know
the
of
course
he
continued
but
i
do
know
somethin
of
that
section
of
country
fer
i
done
a
little
prospectin
there
myself
once
on
a
time
but
it
in
the
oil
territory
them
days
or
known
to
be
anyway
but
it
eatin
itself
up
with
taxes
ai
it
objected
bixbee
he
replied
it
free
an
clear
an
the
taxes
ai
so
very
much
though
they
do
stick
it
to
an
outside
owner
down
there
an
the
is
here
i
alwus
thought
they
did
drill
deep
enough
in
that
section
the
was
some
little
traces
of
oil
the
time
i
told
ye
of
i
heard
lately
that
the
some
talk
of
a
move
to
test
the
territory
agin
an
if
anythin
was
to
be
found
the
young
feller
might
be
wuth
somethin
but
he
added
of
course
the
ai
no
tellin
chapter
xxxvi
well
said
miss
verjoos
when
her
sister
overtook
her
euston
having
stopped
at
his
own
gate
you
and
your
latest
discovery
seemed
to
be
getting
on
pretty
well
from
the
occasional
sounds
which
came
to
my
ears
what
is
he
like
he
charming
declared
miss
clara
indeed
remarked
her
sister
lifting
her
eyebrows
you
seem
to
have
come
to
a
pretty
broad
conclusion
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
does
leave
very
much
to
be
added
on
longer
acquaintance
does
it
oh
yes
it
does
said
miss
clara
laughing
there
are
all
degrees
charming
very
charming
most
charming
and
charming
to
be
sure
replied
the
other
and
there
is
the
descending
scale
perfectly
charming
most
charming
very
charming
charming
very
pleasant
quite
nice
and
oh
yes
well
enough
of
course
you
have
asked
him
to
call
yes
i
have
said
miss
clara
do
you
think
that
mamma
no
i
do
declared
the
girl
with
decision
i
know
from
what
euston
said
and
i
know
from
the
little
talk
i
had
with
him
this
morning
from
his
manner
and
ne
sais
that
he
will
be
a
welcome
addition
to
a
set
of
people
in
which
every
single
one
knows
just
what
every
other
one
will
say
on
any
given
subject
and
on
any
occasion
you
know
how
it
is
well
said
the
elder
sister
smiling
and
half
shutting
her
eyes
with
a
musing
look
i
think
myself
that
we
all
know
each
other
a
little
too
well
to
make
our
affairs
very
exciting
let
us
hope
the
new
man
will
be
all
you
anticipate
and
she
added
with
a
little
laugh
and
a
side
glance
at
her
sister
that
there
will
be
enough
of
him
to
go
it
hardly
needs
to
be
said
that
the
aristocracy
of
homeville
and
all
the
summer
visitors
and
residents
devoted
their
time
to
getting
as
much
pleasure
and
amusement
out
of
their
life
as
was
to
be
afforded
by
the
opportunities
at
hand
boating
tennis
riding
driving
an
occasional
picnic
by
invitation
at
one
or
the
other
of
two
very
pretty
waterfalls
far
enough
away
to
make
the
drive
there
and
back
a
feature
as
much
dancing
in
an
informal
way
as
could
be
managed
by
the
younger
people
and
a
certain
amount
of
flirtation
of
course
but
of
a
very
harmless
sort
to
supply
zest
to
all
the
rest
but
it
is
not
intended
to
give
a
minute
account
of
the
life
nor
to
describe
in
detail
all
the
pursuits
and
festivities
which
prevailed
during
the
season
enough
to
say
that
our
friend
soon
had
opportunity
to
partake
in
them
as
much
and
often
as
was
compatible
with
his
duties
his
first
call
at
lakelawn
happened
to
be
on
an
evening
when
the
ladies
were
not
at
home
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
upon
this
the
occasion
of
his
first
essay
of
the
sort
he
experienced
a
strong
feeling
of
relief
to
be
able
to
leave
cards
instead
of
meeting
a
number
of
strange
people
as
he
had
thought
would
be
likely
one
morning
some
days
later
peleg
hopkins
came
in
with
a
grin
and
said
the
some
folks
eout
in
front
wants
you
to
come
eout
an
see
who
are
they
asked
john
who
for
the
moment
was
in
the
back
room
and
had
not
seen
the
carriage
drive
up
the
two
verjoos
gals
said
peleg
with
another
distortion
of
his
freckled
countenance
one
on
hailed
me
as
i
was
comin
in
and
ast
me
to
ast
you
to
come
eout
john
laughed
a
little
as
he
wondered
what
their
feeling
would
be
were
they
aware
that
they
were
denominated
as
the
verjoos
gals
by
people
of
peleg
standing
in
the
community
we
were
so
sorry
to
miss
your
visit
the
other
evening
said
miss
clara
after
the
usual
salutations
john
said
something
about
the
loss
having
been
his
own
and
after
a
few
remarks
of
no
special
moment
the
young
woman
proceeded
to
set
forth
her
errand
do
you
know
the
bensons
from
syrchester
she
asked
john
replied
that
he
knew
who
they
were
but
had
not
the
pleasure
of
their
acquaintance
well
said
miss
clara
they
are
extremely
nice
people
and
benson
is
very
musical
in
fact
benson
does
something
in
that
line
himself
they
have
with
them
for
a
few
days
a
violinist
fairman
i
think
his
name
is
from
boston
and
a
pianist
what
was
it
juliet
schlitz
i
think
said
miss
verjoos
oh
yes
that
is
it
and
they
are
coming
to
the
house
and
we
are
going
to
have
some
music
in
an
informal
sort
of
way
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
come
if
you
can
i
shall
be
delighted
said
john
sincerely
at
what
time
any
time
you
like
she
said
but
the
bensons
will
probably
get
there
about
eight
or
nine
thank
you
very
much
and
i
shall
be
delighted
he
repeated
miss
clara
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
a
hesitating
air
there
is
another
thing
she
said
yes
yes
she
replied
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
you
will
surely
be
asked
to
sing
quite
a
good
many
people
who
have
heard
you
in
the
quartette
in
church
are
anxious
to
hear
you
sing
alone
benson
among
them
john
face
fell
a
little
you
do
sing
other
than
church
music
do
you
not
she
asked
yes
he
admitted
i
know
some
other
music
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
bore
to
you
no
said
john
who
indeed
saw
no
way
out
of
it
i
will
bring
some
music
with
pleasure
if
you
wish
that
very
nice
of
you
said
miss
clara
and
you
will
give
us
all
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
that
will
depend
he
said
and
after
a
moment
who
will
play
for
me
i
had
not
thought
of
that
was
the
reply
i
think
i
rather
took
it
for
granted
that
you
could
play
for
yourself
ca
you
after
a
fashion
and
simple
things
he
said
but
on
an
occasion
i
would
rather
not
attempt
it
the
girl
looked
at
her
sister
in
some
perplexity
i
should
think
suggested
miss
verjoos
speaking
for
the
second
time
that
or
herr
schlitz
would
play
your
accompaniments
particularly
if
benson
were
to
ask
him
and
if
he
can
play
for
the
violin
i
should
fancy
he
can
for
the
voice
very
well
said
john
we
will
let
it
go
at
that
as
he
spoke
david
came
round
the
corner
of
the
bank
and
up
to
the
carriage
how
do
miss
verjoos
how
air
ye
miss
claricy
he
asked
taking
off
his
straw
hat
and
mopping
his
face
and
head
with
his
handkerchief
guess
we
goin
to
lose
our
sleighin
ai
we
it
seems
to
be
going
pretty
fast
replied
miss
clara
laughing
yes
he
remarked
we
sh
be
scrapin
bare
ground
putty
soon
now
if
this
weather
holds
on
how
the
old
hoss
now

agin
he
asked
seem
to
wintered
putty
well
putty
chipper

he
better

she
affirmed

behind

desks
and
perched
himself
up
on
a
stool
near
the
teller

she
picked
a
thread
off
his
sleeve
and
took
the
opportunity
to
turn
him
round
for
the
purpose
of
giving
him
a
thorough
inspection
that
what

chapter
xxxvii
the
verjoos
house
of
old
red
brick
stands
about
a
hundred
feet
back
from
the
north
side
of
the
lake
road
on
the
south
shore
of
the
lake
since
its
original
construction
a
has
been
built
upon
the
front
a
very
broad
hall
from
which
rises
the
stairway
with
a
double
turn
and
landing
divides
the
main
body
of
the
house
through
the
middle
on
the
left
as
one
enters
is
the
great
drawing
room
on
the
right
a
parlor
opening
into
a
library
and
beyond
the
dining
room
which
looks
out
over
the
lake
the
hall
opens
in
the
rear
upon
a
broad
covered
veranda
facing
the
lake
with
a
flight
of
steps
to
a
lawn
which
slopes
down
to
the
lake
shore
a
distance
of
some
hundred
and
fifty
yards
john
had
to
pass
through
a
little
flock
of
young
people
who
stood
near
and
about
the
entrance
to
the
drawing
room
and
having
given
his
package
of
music
to
the
maid
in
waiting
with
a
request
that
it
be
put
upon
the
piano
he
mounted
the
stairs
to
deposit
his
hat
and
coat
and
then
went
down
in
the
south
end
of
the
drawing
room
were
some
twenty
people
sitting
and
standing
about
most
of
them
the
elders
of
the
families
who
constituted
society
in
homeville
many
of
whom
john
had
met
and
nearly
all
of
whom
he
knew
by
sight
and
name
on
the
edge
of
the
group
and
halfway
down
the
room
were
verjoos
and
her
younger
daughter
who
gave
him
a
cordial
greeting
and
the
elder
lady
was
kind
enough
to
repeat
her
daughter
morning
assurances
of
regret
that
they
were
out
on
the
occasion
of
his
call
i
trust
you
have
been
as
good
as
your
word
said
miss
clara
and
brought
some
music
yes
it
is
on
the
piano
he
replied
looking
across
the
room
to
where
the
instrument
stood
the
girl
laughed
i
wish
she
said
you
could
have
heard
what
harum
said
this
morning
about
your
singing
particularly
his
description
of
the
lost
chord
and
i
wish
that
i
could
repeat
it
just
as
he
gave
it
it
about
a
feller
sittin
one
day
by
the
came
a
voice
from
behind
john
shoulder
so
like
david
as
fairly
to
startle
him
not
feelin
right
kind
o
tired
an
out
o
sorts
an
not
knowin
jest
where
he
was
drivin
at
jest
joggin
along
with
a
loose
rein
fer
quite
a
piece
an
so
on
an
then
by
an
by
strikin
right
into
his
gait
an
goin
on
stronger
an
stronger
an
up
with
an
a
men
that
carries
him
quarter
way
the
track
he
pull
up
they
all
laughed
except
miss
verjoos
whose
gravity
was
unbroken
save
that
behind
the
dusky
windows
of
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
john
there
was
for
an
instant
a
gleam
of
mischievous
drollery
good
evening
lenox
she
said
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
and
hardly
waiting
for
his
response
she
turned
and
walked
away
that
is
juliet
all
over
said
her
sister
you
would
not
think
to
see
her
ordinarily
that
she
was
given
to
that
sort
of
thing
but
once
in
a
while
when
she
feels
like
it
well
pranks
she
is
the
funniest
creature
that
ever
lived
i
believe
and
can
mimic
and
imitate
any
mortal
creature
she
sat
in
the
carriage
this
morning
and
one
might
have
fancied
from
her
expression
that
she
hardly
heard
a
word
but
i
have
a
doubt
that
she
could
repeat
every
syllable
that
was
uttered
oh
here
come
the
bensons
and
their
musicians
john
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
toward
the
end
of
the
room
but
was
presently
recalled
and
presented
to
the
newcomers
after
a
little
talk
the
bensons
settled
themselves
in
the
corner
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
where
seats
were
placed
for
the
two
musicians
and
our
friend
took
a
seat
near
where
he
had
been
standing
the
violinist
adjusted
his
folding
music
rest
miss
clara
stepped
over
to
the
entrance
door
and
put
up
her
finger
at
the
young
people
in
the
hall
after
the
music
begins
she
said
with
a
shake
of
the
head
if
i
hear
one
sound
of
giggling
or
chattering
i
will
send
every
one
of
you
young
heathen
home
remember
now
this
is
your
party
at
all
but
clara
dear
said
sue
tenaker
aged
fifteen
if
we
are
very
good
and
quiet
do
you
think
they
would
play
for
us
to
dance
a
little
by
and
by
impudence
exclaimed
miss
clara
giving
the
girl
cheek
a
playful
slap
and
going
back
to
her
place
miss
verjoos
came
in
and
took
a
chair
by
her
sister
benson
leaned
forward
and
raised
her
eyebrows
at
miss
clara
who
took
a
quick
survey
of
the
room
and
nodded
in
return
herr
schlitz
seated
himself
on
the
piano
chair
pushed
it
a
little
back
drew
it
a
little
forward
to
the
original
place
looked
under
the
piano
at
the
pedals
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
face
and
hands
and
after
arpeggioing
up
and
down
the
swung
into
a
waltz
of
chopin
opus
number
a
favorite
of
our
friend
and
which
he
would
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
for
it
was
splendidly
played
if
he
had
not
been
uneasily
apprehensive
that
he
might
be
asked
to
sing
after
it
and
while
on
some
accounts
he
would
have
been
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
have
it
over
he
felt
a
cowardly
sense
of
relief
when
the
violinist
came
forward
for
the
next
number
there
had
been
enthusiastic
applause
at
the
north
end
of
the
room
and
more
or
less
clapping
of
hands
at
the
south
end
but
not
enough
to
impel
the
pianist
to
supplement
his
performance
at
the
time
the
violin
number
was
so
well
received
that
fairman
added
a
little
minuet
of
boccherini
without
accompaniment
and
then
john
felt
that
his
time
had
surely
come
but
he
had
to
sit
drawing
long
breaths
through
a
liszt
fantasie
on
themes
from
faust
before
his
suspense
was
ended
by
miss
clara
who
was
apparently
mistress
of
ceremonies
and
who
said
to
him
will
you
sing
now
mr
lenox
he
rose
and
went
to
the
end
of
the
room
where
the
pianist
was
sitting
i
have
been
asked
to
sing
he
said
to
that
gentleman
can
i
induce
you
to
be
so
kind
as
to
play
for
me
i
am
sure
he
will
said
benson
looking
at
herr
schlitz
oh
yes
i
blay
for
you
if
you
vant
he
said
vhere
is
your
moosic
they
went
over
to
the
piano
oh
ho
jensen
lassen
helmund
grieg
you
zing
dem
some
of
them
said
john
the
pianist
opened
the
jensen
album
you
want
to
zing
one
of
dese
he
asked
as
well
as
anything
replied
john
who
had
changed
his
mind
a
dozen
times
in
the
last
ten
minutes
and
was
ready
to
accept
any
suggestion
ver
goot
said
the
other
ve
dry
dis
lehn
deine
wang
an
meine
wang
his
face
brightened
as
john
began
to
sing
the
german
words
in
a
measure
or
two
the
singer
and
player
were
in
perfect
accord
and
as
the
former
found
his
voice
the
ends
of
his
fingers
grew
warm
again
at
the
end
of
the
song
the
applause
was
distributed
about
as
after
the
chopin
waltz
sehr
sch√∂n
exclaimed
herr
schlitz
looking
up
and
nodding
you
must
zing
zome
more
and
he
played
the
first
bars
of
marie
am
fenster
sitzest
du
humming
the
words
under
his
breath
and
quite
oblivious
of
any
one
but
himself
and
the
singer
zierlich
he
said
when
the
song
was
done
reaching
for
the
collection
of
lassen
mit
deinen
blauen
augen
he
hummed
keeping
time
with
his
hands
but
at
this
point
miss
clara
came
across
the
room
followed
by
her
sister
tenaker
she
said
laughing
asked
me
to
ask
you
lenox
if
you
would
please
sing
something
they
could
understand
i
have
a
song
i
should
like
to
hear
you
sing
said
miss
verjoos
there
is
an
obligato
for
violin
and
we
have
a
violinist
here
it
is
a
beautiful
song
tosti
beauty
eyes
do
you
know
it
yes
he
replied
will
you
sing
it
for
me
she
asked
with
the
greatest
pleasure
he
answered
once
as
he
sang
the
lines
of
the
song
he
looked
up
miss
verjoos
was
sitting
with
her
elbows
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
her
cheek
resting
upon
her
clasped
hands
and
her
dusky
eyes
were
fastened
upon
his
face
as
the
song
concluded
she
rose
and
walked
away
tenaker
came
over
to
the
piano
and
put
out
her
hand
thank
you
so
much
for
your
singing
lenox
she
said
would
you
like
to
do
an
old
woman
a
favor
very
much
so
said
john
smiling
and
looking
first
at
tenaker
and
then
about
the
room
but
there
are
no
old
women
here
as
far
as
i
can
see
very
pretty
sir
very
pretty
she
said
looking
very
graciously
at
him
will
you
sing
annie
laurie
for
me
with
all
my
heart
he
said
bowing
he
looked
at
herr
schlitz
who
shook
his
head
let
me
play
it
for
you
said
benson
coming
over
to
the
piano
where
do
you
want
it
she
asked
modulating
softly
from
one
key
to
another
i
think
d
flat
will
be
about
right
he
replied
kindly
play
a
little
bit
of
it
the
sound
of
the
symphony
brought
most
of
even
the
young
people
into
the
drawing
room
at
the
end
of
the
first
verse
there
was
a
subdued
rustle
of
applause
a
little
more
after
the
second
and
at
the
end
of
the
song
so
much
of
a
burst
of
approval
as
could
be
produced
by
the
audience
benson
looked
up
into
john
face
and
smiled
we
appear
to
have
scored
the
success
of
the
evening
she
said
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
miss
clara
joined
them
what
a
dear
old
song
that
is
she
said
did
you
see
aunt
charlie
tenaker
wiping
her
eyes
and
that
lovely
thing
of
tosti
we
are
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
mr
lenox
john
bowed
his
acknowledgments
will
you
take
benson
out
to
supper
there
is
a
special
table
for
you
musical
people
at
the
east
end
of
the
veranda
is
this
merely
a
segregation
or
a
distinction
said
john
as
they
sat
down
we
shall
have
to
wait
developments
to
decide
that
point
i
should
say
replied
benson
i
suppose
that
fifth
place
was
put
on
the
off
chance
that
benson
might
be
of
our
party
but
she
said
with
a
short
laugh
he
is
probably
nine
fathoms
deep
in
a
flirtation
with
sue
tenaker
he
shares
artemas
ward
tastes
who
said
you
may
remember
that
he
liked
little
girls
big
ones
too
a
maid
appeared
with
a
tray
of
eatables
and
presently
another
with
a
tray
on
which
were
glasses
and
a
bottle
of
pommery
miss
compliments
she
said
what
do
you
think
now
asked
benson
laughing
distinctly
a
distinction
i
should
say
he
replied
das
ist
nicht
so
schlecht
grunted
herr
schlitz
as
he
put
half
a
into
his
mouth
bot
i
vould
brefer
beer
the
music
has
been
a
great
treat
to
me
remarked
john
i
have
heard
nothing
of
the
sort
for
two
years
you
have
quite
contributed
your
share
of
the
entertainment
said
benson
you
and
i
together
he
responded
smiling
you
have
got
a
woice
said
herr
schlitz
speaking
with
a
mouthful
of
salad
und
you
zing
ligh
a
moosician
und
you
bronounce
your
vorts
very
goot
thank
you
said
john
after
supper
there
was
more
singing
in
the
drawing
room
but
it
was
not
of
a
very
classical
order
something
short
and
taking
for
violin
and
piano
was
followed
by
an
announcement
from
herr
schlitz
i
zing
you
a
zong
he
said
the
worthy
man
breferred
beer
but
had
perhaps
found
the
wine
quicker
in
effect
and
in
a
tremendous
bass
voice
he
roared
out
im
tiefen
keller
sitz
ich
hier
auf
einem
fass
voll
reben
which
if
not
wholly
understood
by
the
audience
had
some
of
its
purport
conveyed
by
the
threefold
repetition
of
trinke
at
the
end
of
each
verse
then
a
deputation
waited
upon
john
to
ask
in
behalf
of
the
girls
and
boys
if
he
knew
and
could
sing
solomon
levi
yes
he
said
sitting
down
at
the
piano
if
you
all
sing
with
me
and
it
came
to
pass
that
that
classic
followed
by
bring
back
my
bonnie
to
me
paddy
duffy
cart
there
music
in
the
air
and
sundry
other
ditties
dear
to
all
hearts
was
given
by
the
full
strength
of
the
company
with
such
enthusiasm
that
even
fairman
was
moved
to
join
in
with
his
violin
and
when
the
soldier
farewell
was
given
herr
schlitz
would
have
sung
the
windows
out
of
their
frames
had
they
not
been
open
altogether
the
evening
programme
was
brought
to
an
end
with
a
grand
climax
thank
you
very
much
said
john
as
he
said
good
night
to
verjoos
i
do
know
when
i
have
enjoyed
an
evening
so
much
thank
very
much
she
returned
graciously
you
have
given
us
all
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
yes
said
miss
verjoos
giving
her
hand
with
a
mischievous
gleam
in
her
eyes
i
was
enchanted
with
solomon
levi
chapter
xxxviii
david
and
john
had
been
driving
for
some
time
in
silence
the
elder
man
was
apparently
musing
upon
something
which
had
been
suggested
to
his
mind
the
horses
slackened
their
gait
to
a
walk
as
they
began
the
ascent
of
a
long
hill
presently
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
sound
which
caused
john
to
turn
his
head
with
a
look
of
surprised
amusement
harum
was
singing
the
tune
if
it
could
be
so
called
was
scaleless
and
these
were
the
words
i
me
a
to
a
contented
an
was
to
how
poor
was
break
o
my
on
the
did
she
up
her
an
i
heard
never
heard
me
sing
before
did
ye
he
said
looking
with
a
grin
at
his
companion
who
laughed
and
said
that
he
had
never
had
that
pleasure
that
all
i
remember
o
said
david
an
i
dunno
thought
about
it
in
thirty
year
the
was
a
number
o
verses
which
carried
through
the
rest
o
the
week
an
ended
up
in
a
case
of
an
battery
i
but
i
do
remember
jest
how
somethin
we
ben
sayin
put
the
thing
into
my
head
i
guess
i
should
like
to
hear
the
rest
of
it
said
john
smiling
david
made
no
reply
to
this
and
seemed
to
be
turning
something
over
in
his
mind
at
last
he
said
mebbe
polly
told
ye
that
i
a
john
admitted
that
bixbee
had
said
as
much
as
that
yes
sir
said
david
i
a
of
long
standin
no
appropriate
comment
suggesting
itself
to
his
listener
none
was
made
i
hai
never
cared
to
say
much
about
it
to
polly
he
remarked
though
fer
that
matter
jim
bixbee
f
all
accounts
was
about
as
poor
a
shack
as
ever
was
turned
out
i
guess
an
john
took
advantage
of
the
slight
hesitation
to
interpose
against
what
he
apprehended
might
be
a
lengthy
digression
on
the
subject
of
the
deceased
bixbee
by
saying
you
were
quite
a
young
fellow
when
you
were
married
i
infer
two
or
three
years
younger
you
be
i
guess
said
david
looking
at
him
an
a
putty
green
colt
too
in
some
ways
he
added
handing
over
the
reins
and
whip
while
he
got
out
his
silver
tobacco
box
and
helped
himself
to
a
liberal
portion
of
its
contents
it
was
plain
that
he
was
in
the
mood
for
personal
reminiscences
as
i
look
back
o
now
he
began
it
kind
o
seems
as
if
it
must
ben
some
other
feller
an
yet
i
remember
it
all
putty
dum
well
too
all
but
one
thing
an
that
the
biggist
part
o
an
that
is
how
i
ever
come
to
git
married
at
all
she
was
a
widdo
at
the
time
kep
the
boardin
house
where
i
was
livin
it
was
up
to
syrchester
i
was
better
lookin
them
days
i
be
now
had
more
hair
at
any
rate
though
he
remarked
with
a
grin
i
was
alwus
a
better
goer
than
i
was
a
looker
i
was
doin
fairly
well
he
continued
but
mebbe
not
so
well
as
was
thought
by
some
she
was
a
woman
some
older
i
was
she
seemed
to
take
some
shine
to
me
i
roughed
it
putty
much
alwus
an
she
was
putty
clever
to
me
she
was
a
good
talker
liked
a
joke
an
a
laugh
had
some
education
an
it
come
about
that
i
got
to
beauin
her
quite
a
and
used
to
go
an
set
in
her
room
or
the
parlor
with
her
sometimes
evenin
an
all
that
an
i
would
deny
that
i
liked
it
putty
well
it
was
some
minutes
before
harum
resumed
his
narrative
the
reins
were
sagging
over
the
dashboard
held
loosely
between
the
first
two
fingers
and
thumb
of
his
left
hand
while
with
his
right
he
had
been
making
abstracted
cuts
at
the
thistles
and
other
eligible
marks
along
the
roadside
he
said
at
last
we
was
married
an
our
wheels
tracked
putty
well
fer
quite
a
spell
i
got
to
thinkin
more
of
her
all
the
time
an
she
me
we
took
a
few
days
off
together
two
three
times
that
summer
to
an
saratogy
an
an
had
real
good
times
i
got
to
thinkin
that
the
state
of
matrimony
was
a
putty
good
institution
when
it
come
along
fall
i
was
doin
well
enough
so
she
could
give
up
an
i
hired
a
house
an
we
set
up
housekeepin
it
was
really
more
on
my
account
than
fer
i
got
to
kind
o
feelin
that
when
the
meat
was
tough
or
the
pie
done
on
the
bottom
that
i
was
with
it
an
i
wanted
a
place
of
my
own
but
he
added
i
guess
it
was
a
mistake
fur
she
was
concerned
why
said
john
feeling
that
some
show
of
interest
was
incumbent
i
reckon
said
david
she
kind
o
missed
the
an
the
talk
at
table
an
the
goin
on
an
mebbe
the
work
of
runnin
the
place
she
was
a
great
worker
an
it
got
to
be
some
i
after
a
spell
settin
down
to
three
meals
a
day
with
jest
only
me
of
a
tableful
to
say
nothin
of
the
evenin
i
was
glad
enough
to
have
a
place
of
my
own
but
at
the
same
time
i
had
ben
used
to
settin
with
nothin
to
do
or
say
with
somebody
else
that
had
neither
an
i
then
nor
ai
now
fer
that
matter
any
great
hand
fer
readin
then
too
we
moved
into
a
part
o
the
town
where
my
wife
acquainted
anyway
fust
things
begun
to
drag
some
she
begun
to
have
spells
of
not
speakin
an
then
she
begun
to
git
notions
about
me
once
in
a
while
i
have
to
go
down
town
on
some
in
the
evenin
she
did
seem
to
mind
it
at
fust
but
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
the
so
much
goin
on
as
i
made
out
an
though
along
that
time
set
sometimes
mebbe
the
hull
evenin
without
sayin
anythin
more
yes
or
no
an
putty
often
not
that
yet
if
i
went
out
there
be
a
an
as
things
went
on
the
be
spells
fer
a
together
when
i
could
any
time
of
day
git
a
word
out
of
her
hardly
unless
it
was
to
go
fer
me
somethin
that
mebbe
i
done
an
mebbe
i
had
it
did
make
no
an
when
them
spells
was
on
what
she
did
take
out
o
me
she
did
out
o
the
house
diggin
scrubbin
takin
up
carpits
layin
down
carpits
shiftin
the
furniture
eatin
one
day
in
the
kitchin
an
another
in
the
room
an
sleepin
most
anywhere
she
real
well
after
a
while
an
the
wuss
she
seemed
to
feel
the
fiercer
she
was
fer
scrubbin
diggin
an
upsettin
things
in
an
she
got
so
she
could
keep
a
hired
girl
in
the
house
more
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
she
either
would
have
or
they
would
stay
an
more
half
the
time
we
was
without
one
this
ca
you
much
can
it
said
harum
turning
to
his
companion
on
the
contrary
replied
john
it
interests
me
very
much
i
was
thinking
he
added
that
probably
the
state
of
your
wife
health
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
her
actions
and
views
of
things
but
it
must
have
been
pretty
hard
on
you
all
the
same
yes
said
david
i
guess
that
so
her
health
jest
right
an
she
showed
it
in
her
looks
i
noticed
that
she
pined
pindled
some
but
i
thought
the
was
some
natural
mixed
up
into
it
too
but
i
tried
to
make
an
the
best
things
an
git
along
well
i
could
but
things
kind
o
got
wuss
an
wuss
i
told
ye
that
she
begun
to
have
notions
about
me
an
ai
hardly
to
say
what
shape
they
took
an
after
a
while
mebbe
a
year
a
half
she
got
so
she
satisfied
to
know
where
i
was
she
wanted
to
know
where
i
was
kind
makes
me
laugh
now
he
observed
it
seems
so
but
it
no
laughin
matter
then
if
i
looked
out
o
winder
she
hint
it
up
to
me
that
i
was
watchin
some
woman
she
grudged
me
even
to
look
at
a
picture
paper
an
one
day
when
we
happened
to
be
walkin
together
she
showed
feelin
about
one
o
them
wooden
injun
women
outside
a
cigar
store
oh
come
now
harum
said
john
laughing
said
david
with
a
short
laugh
mebbe
i
did
stretch
that
a
little
but
i
told
ye
she
wanted
to
know
where
i
was
daytimes
well
nights
an
once
a
while
she
turn
up
at
my
place
an
if
i
there
she
set
an
wait
fer
me
an
i
either
have
to
go
home
with
her
or
have
it
out
in
the
office
i
do
mean
to
say
that
all
the
sort
of
thing
i
tellin
ye
of
kep
up
all
the
time
it
kind
run
in
streaks
but
the
streaks
kep
comin
oftener
an
oftener
an
you
could
never
tell
when
the
was
goin
to
appear
matters
go
along
putty
well
fer
a
while
an
then
all
of
a
sudden
an
fer
nothin
i
could
see
the
come
on
a
thunder
shower
you
c
git
in
out
the
wet
singular
said
john
thoughtfully
yes
sir
said
david
it
come
along
to
the
second
spring
the
first
of
may
she
ben
more
like
folks
fer
about
a
week
mebbe
she
had
fer
a
long
spell
an
i
begun
to
chirk
up
some
i
remember
jest
how
i
got
the
idee
but
f
somethin
she
let
drop
i
gathered
that
she
was
thinkin
of
havin
a
new
bunnit
i
will
say
this
for
her
remarked
david
that
she
was
an
economical
woman
an
never
spent
no
money
jest
fer
the
sake
o
spendin
it
we
got
along
so
nice
fer
a
while
that
i
felt
more
usual
like
pleasin
her
an
i
allowed
to
myself
that
if
she
wanted
a
new
bunnit
money
should
stand
in
the
way
an
i
set
out
to
give
her
a
supprise
they
had
reached
the
level
at
the
top
of
the
long
hill
and
the
horses
had
broken
into
a
trot
when
harum
narrative
was
interrupted
and
his
equanimity
upset
by
the
onslaught
of
an
excessively
shrill
active
and
conscientious
dog
of
the
yellow
variety
which
barked
and
sprang
about
in
front
of
the
mares
with
such
frantic
assiduity
as
at
last
to
communicate
enough
of
its
excitement
to
them
to
cause
them
to
bolt
forward
on
a
run
passing
the
yellow
nuisance
which
with
the
facility
of
long
practice
dodged
the
cut
which
david
made
at
it
in
passing
it
was
with
some
little
trouble
that
the
horses
were
brought
back
to
a
sober
pace
dum
that
dum
dog
exclaimed
david
with
fervor
looking
back
to
where
the
object
of
his
execrations
was
still
discharging
convulsive
yelps
at
the
retreating
vehicle
i
give
a
note
to
git
one
good
lick
at
him
i
make
him
holler
why
willin
to
have
such
a
dum
wuthless
pestiferous
varmint
as
that
more
i
understand
i
bet
that
the
days
they
churn
that
critter
unless
they
ketch
him
an
tie
him
up
the
night
before
be
under
the
barn
all
day
an
he
jest
blowed
off
steam
enough
to
run
a
dog
churn
a
hull
forenoon
whether
or
not
the
episode
of
the
dog
had
diverted
harum
mind
from
his
previous
topic
he
did
not
resume
it
until
john
ventured
to
remind
him
of
it
with
you
were
saying
something
about
the
surprise
for
your
wife
that
so
said
david
yes
when
i
went
home
that
night
i
stopped
into
a
store
an
after
i
stood
a
minute
a
girl
come
up
an
ast
me
if
she
c
show
me
anythin
want
to
buy
a
bunnit
i
says
an
she
kind
o
laughed
i
says
ai
fer
me
it
fer
a
lady
i
says
an
then
we
both
laughed
sort
of
a
bunnit
do
you
want
she
says
i
dunno
i
says
is
the
fust
time
i
ever
done
in
the
bunnit
line
so
she
went
over
to
a
glass
case
an
took
one
out
an
held
it
up
turnin
it
on
her
hand
i
says
guess
it
putty
enough
fur
it
goes
but
do
seem
to
be
much
of
anythin
it
hai
you
got
somethin
a
little
bit
bigger
an
she
says
is
this
she
says
doin
the
same
trick
with
another
i
says
looks
more
like
it
but
i
had
an
idee
that
the
a
fine
article
had
more
traps
o
an
most
any
one
might
have
on
either
one
o
them
you
showed
me
an
not
attrac
no
attention
at
all
you
need
mind
expense
i
says
very
well
she
says
guess
i
know
what
you
want
an
goes
over
to
another
case
an
fetches
out
another
bunnit
twice
as
big
as
either
the
others
an
with
more
notions

john
laughed
outright
david
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
a
doubtful
grin
she
a
slick
one
she
he
said
what
a
hoss
trader
she
would
made
i
did
ketch
on
at
the
time

afterward
he

reasonable
time
she
says
all
right
i
says
her
up
an
so
she
wrapped
the
thing
with
soft
paper
an
put
it
in
a
box
an
i
paid
an
moseyed
along
up
home
feelin
that
man
woman
an
child

their
eyes
on
my
parcel
but
thinkin
how
tickled
my
wife
would
be
chapter
xxxix
the
road
they
were
on
was
a
favorite
drive
with
the
two
men
and
at
the
point
where
they
had
now
arrived
david
always
halted
for
a
look
back
and
down
upon
the
scene
below
them
to
the
south
beyond
the
intervening
fields
bright
with
maturing
crops
lay
the
village
to
the
west
the
blue
lake
winding
its
length
like
a
broad
river
and
the
river
itself
a
silver
ribbon
till
it
was
lost
beneath
the
southern
hills
neither
spoke
for
a
few
minutes
john
took
in
the
scene
with
the
pleasure
it
always
afforded
him
and
then
glanced
at
his
companion
who
usually
had
some
comment
to
make
upon
anything
which
stirred
his
admiration
or
interest
he
was
gazing
not
at
the
landscape
but
apparently
at
the
top
of
the
dashboard
ho
hum
he
said
straightening
the
reins
with
a
clk
to
the
horses
and
they
drove
along
for
a
while
in
silence
so
long
in
fact
that
our
friend
while
aware
that
the
elder
man
did
not
usually
abandon
a
topic
until
he
had
had
his
say
out
was
moved
to
suggest
a
continuance
of
the
narrative
which
had
been
rather
abruptly
broken
off
and
in
which
he
had
become
considerably
interested
was
your
wife
pleased
he
asked
at
last
where

i
asked

then
as

asked
john
after
a
brief
silence
conscious
of
the
bluntness
of
his
question
but
curious
as
to
the
sequel
the
child
did
replied
david
not
to
grow
up
but
till
he
was
six
an
seven
but
my
wife
never
left
her
bed
though
she
lived
three
four
weeks
she
never
seemed
to
take
no
in
the
little
feller
nor
nothin
else
much
but
one
day
it
was
sunday
long
to
the
last

seemed
a
little
more
chipper
usual
i

settin

though
she
says
almost
in
a
whisper
an
the
came
across
her
face
not
a
smile
but
somethin
like
a
little
riffle
on
a
piece
o
still
water
bunnit
enough
to
kill

chapter

john
leaned
out
of
the
buggy
and
looked
back
along
the
road
as
if
deeply
interested
in
observing
something
which
had
attracted
his
attention
and
david
face
worked
oddly
for
a
moment
turning
south
in
the
direction
of
the
village
they
began
the
descent
of
a
steep
hill
and
harum
careful
of
loose
stones
gave
all
his
attention
to
his
driving
our
friend
respecting
his
vigilance
forebore
to
say
anything
which
might
distract
his
attention
until
they
reached
level
ground
and
then
you
never
married
again
he
queried
no
was
the
reply
my
matrymonial
experience
was
an
to
the
as
the
sayin
is
and
yet
urged
john

a
young
man

david
breaking
in
and
emitting
his
chuckling
laugh

on
that
way
till
the
no
further
occasion
fur
he
was
concerned
though
i
lived
with
them
a
spell
longer
when
i
was
at
home
which
very
often
an
after
he
died
i
was
gone
fer
a
good
while
but
before
that
time
when
i
was
at
home
i
had
him
with
me
all
the
time
i
could
manage
with
good
care
he
growed
up
nice
an
bright
an
as
big
as
the
average
an
smarter
a
steel
trap
he
liked
bein
with
me
better
anybody
else
and
when
i
c
manage
to
have
him
i
bear
to
have
him
out
o
my
sight
as
i
told
you
he
got
to
be
most
seven
year
old
i
had
to
go
out
to

an
one
day
i

i
took
the
fust

an
we

a
breakdown
an
run
into
an
awful
snowstorm
an
one
thing
another
an
i
lost
twelve
or
fifteen
hours
it
seemed
to
me
that
them
two
days
was
longer
my
hull
life
but
i
did
git
home
about
nine
in
the
mornin
when
i

to
the
house
mis
jones
was
on
the
lookout
fer
me
an
the
door

as

shoulders
i
says

but
he
was
out
of
his
head
most
of
the
time
after

time

daddy
an
then
she
throwed
her
apern
over
her
face
an
david
tipped
his
hat
a
little
farther
over
his
eyes
though
like
many
if
not
most
horsey
men
he
usually
wore
it
rather
far
down
and
leaning
over
twirled
the
whip
in
the
socket
between
his
two
fingers
and
thumb
john
studied
the
stitched
ornamentation
of
the
dashboard
until
the
reins
were
pushed
into
his
hands
but
it
was
not
for
long
david
straightened
himself
and
without
turning
his
head
resumed
them
as
if
that
were
a
matter
of
course
day
after
the
he
went
on
i
says
to
mis

john
fervently
she
lived
twenty
year
said
david
an
i
wish
she
was
livin
now
i
never
drawed
a
check
on
her
account
without
feelin
i
was
somethin
for
my
little
boy
the
a
good
many
sorts
an
kinds
o
sorro
he
said
after
a
moment
that
in
some
ways
kind
o
kin
to
each
other
but
i
guess
losin
a
child
a
specie
by
itself
of
course
i
passed
the
achin
smartin
point
years
ago
but
it
somethin
you
ca
fergit
that
is
you
ca
help
feelin
about
it
because
it
ai
only
what
the
child
to
you
but
what
you
keep
thinkin
he
ben
growin
more
more
to
to
you
when
i
lost
my
little
boy
i
did
only
lose
him
as
he
was
but
i
ben
losin
him
over
an
agin
all
these
years
what
ben
when
he
was
old
an
what
when
he
got
to
be
a
big
boy
an
what
he
ben
when
he
went
mebbe
to
collidge
an
what
he
ben
afterward
an
up
to
of
course
the
times
when
a
man
stuffs
his
face
down
into
the
pillers
nights
passes
after
a
while
but
while
the
some
sorro
that
the
happenin
o
things
helps
ye
to
fergit
i
guess
the
some
that
the
happenin
o
things
keeps
ye
rememberin
losin
a
child
one
on
chapter
xli
it
was
the
latter
part
of
john
fifth
winter
in
homeville
the
business
of
the
office
had
largely
increased
the
new
manufactories
which
had
been
established
did
their
banking
with
harum
and
the
older
concerns
including
nearly
all
the
merchants
in
the
village
had
transferred
their
accounts
from
syrchester
banks
to
david
the
callow
hopkins
had
fledged
and
developed
into
a
competent
man
able
to
do
anything
in
the
office
and
there
was
a
new
skeezicks
discharging
peleg
former
functions
considerable
impetus
had
been
given
to
the
business
of
the
town
by
the
new
road
whose
rails
had
been
laid
the
previous
summer
there
had
been
a
strong
and
acrimonious
controversy
over
the
route
which
the
road
should
take
into
and
through
the
village
there
was
the
party
of
the
nabobs
as
they
were
characterized
by
harum
and
their
following
and
the
party
of
the
village
people
and
the
former
had
carried
their
point
but
now
the
road
was
an
accomplished
fact
and
most
of
the
bitterness
which
had
been
engendered
had
died
away
yet
the
struggle
was
still
matter
for
talk
did
i
ever
tell
you
said
david
as
he
and
his
cashier
were
sitting
in
the
rear
room
of
the
bank
how
lawyer
staples
come
to
switch
round
in
that
there
railroad
jangle
last
spring
i
remember
said
john
that
you
told
me
he
had
deserted
his
party
and
you
laughed
a
little
at
the
time
but
you
did
not
tell
me
how
it
came
about
i
kind
o
thought
i
told
ye
said
david
no
said
john
i
am
quite
sure
you
did
not
said
harum
the
was
as
you
know
the
crowd
wantin
one
thing
an
the
lot
bound
to
have
the
other
an
run
the
road
under
the
other
fellers
noses
staples
was
workin
tooth
an
nail
fer
the
purse
crowd
an
bein
a
good
deal
of
a
politician
he
was
helpin
a
good
deal
in
fact
he
was
about
their
best
card
i
takin
much
hand
in
the
matter
either
way
though
my
feelin
was
with
the
tenaker
party
i
know
would
come
to
a
point
where
some
money
have
to
be
used
an
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
do
much
drivin
myself
unless
i
had
to
an
not
then
till
the
last
quarter
of
the
heat
it
got
to
lookin
like
a
putty
even
thing
what
little
show
i
had
made
was
if
anythin
on
the
purse
side
one
day
tenaker
come
in
to
see
me
an
wanted
to
know
which
side
the
fence
i
was
on
i
says

settin
up
fer
shapes
to

o
on
the
fence

close
thing
an
goin
to
need
all
the
help
we

i
says

fer
the
present
i
reckon

do
ye
more
good
by

you
folks
prepared
to
spend
a
little
money
i
says

he
says
i
says

staples
he
do
really
care

hill
o

david
with
a
grin
purse

that
says
tenaker
i
says
guess
i
have
to
tell
ye
a
little
story
mebbe
you
heard
it
before
but
it
seems
to
be
to
the
point
once
on
a
time
i
says
was
a
big
church
meetin
that
had
lasted
three
days
an
the
last
evenin
the
was
excitement
the
an
singin
had
warmed
most
on
up
putty
well
an
one
o
the
most
movin
of
the
speakers
was
tellin
what
was
what
the
was
a
big
crowd
an
while
most
on
come
to
be
edified
the
was
quite
a
lot
in
the
back
part
of
the
place
that
was
ready
fer
anythin
it
happened
that
standin
mixed
up
in
that
lot
was
a
feller
named
call
him
smith
to
be
sure
of
him
an
smith
was
jest
runnin
over
with
power
an
little
while
when
somethin
the
speaker
said
touched
him
on
the
funny
bone
he
out
with
an
a
men
lord
in
a
voice
like
a
whistle
after
a
little
the
was
some
an
gigglin
an
scroughin
an
hustlin
in
the
back
part
an
even
some
of
the
serioustest
up
in
front
would
kind
o
smile
an
the
moderator
leaned
over
an
says
to
one
of
the
bretherin
on
the
platform
brother
jones
he
says
ca
you
git
down
to
the
back
of
the
hall
an
say
somethin
to
quiet
brother
smith
smith
a
good
man
an
a
pious
man
the
moderator
says
but
he
very
excitable
an
i
he
git
the
boys
to
goin
back
there
an
disturb
the
meetin
so
jones
he
worked
his
way
back
to
where
smith
was
an
the
moderator
watched
him
go
up
to
smith
and
jest
speak
to
him
ten
seconds
an
after
that
smith
never
peeped
once
after
the
meetin
was
over
the
moderator
says
to
jones
brother
jones
he
says
what
did
you
say
to
brother
smith
that
shut
him
up
so
quick
i
ast
him
fer
a
dollar
for
missions
says
brother
jones
i
says
to
tenaker
what
i
done
to
staples
did
tenaker
see
the
point
asked
john
laughing
he
laughed
a
little
said
david
but
did
quite
ketch
on
till
i
told
him
about
the
subscription
paper
an
then
he
like
to
split
suppose
staples
had
taken
you
up
suggested
john
said
david
i
did
think
i
was
takin
many
chances
if
in
the
fust
place
i
had
knowed
staples
as
well
i
did
the
smith
so
fur
my
experience
goes
has
got
more
members
any
other
on
top
of
the
earth
at
this
point
a
boy
brought
in
a
telegram
david
opened
it
gave
a
side
glance
at
his
companion
and
taking
out
his
pocketbook
put
the
dispatch
therein
chapter
xlii
the
next
morning
david
called
john
into
the
rear
room
busy
he
asked
no
said
john
nothing
that
ca
wait
set
down
said
harum
drawing
a
chair
to
the
fire
he
looked
up
with
his
characteristic
grin
ever
own
a
hog
he
said
no
said
john
smiling
ever
feel
like
ownin
one
i
do
remember
ever
having
any
cravings
in
that
direction
like
pork
asked
harum
in
moderation
was
the
reply
david
produced
from
his
pocketbook
the
dispatch
received
the
day
before
and
handed
it
to
the
young
man
at
his
side
read
that
he
said
john
looked
at
it
and
handed
it
back
it
does
convey
any
idea
to
my
mind
he
said
what
said
david
you
do
know
what
galilee
means
nor
who
is
you
have
to
ask
me
an
easier
one
said
john
smiling
david
sat
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
how
much
money
have
you
got
he
asked
well
was
the
reply
with
what
i
had
and
what
i
have
saved
since
i
came
i
could
get
together
about
five
thousand
dollars
i
think
is
it
where
you
put
your
hands
o
john
took
some
slips
of
paper
from
his
pocketbook
and
handed
them
to
david
h
h
said
the
latter
i
owe
ye
quite
a
little
bunch
money
do
i
hunderd
could
you
done
better
to
keep
this
here
at
four
per
cent
well
said
john
perhaps
so
and
perhaps
not
i
preferred
to
do
this
at
all
events
thought
the
old
man
was
anyway
did
ye
said
david
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
he
was
highly
pleased
yes
said
john
is
this
all
asked
david
there
is
some
interest
on
those
certificates
and
i
have
some
balance
in
my
account
was
the
reply
and
then
you
know
i
have
some
very
valuable
securities
a
beautiful
line
of
mining
stocks
and
that
promising
pennsylvania
property
at
the
mention
of
the
asset
david
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
as
if
about
to
speak
but
if
so
he
changed
his
mind
he
sat
for
a
moment
fingering
the
yellow
paper
which
carried
the
mystic
words
presently
he
said
opening
the
message
out
that
from
an
old
friend
of
mine
out
to
chicago
he
come
from
this
part
of
the
country
an
we
was
young
fellers
together
thirty
years
ago
i
had
a
good
many
deals
with
him
and
through
him
an
he
never
give
me
a
wrong
steer
fur
i
know
that
is
i
never
done
as
he
told
me
without
comin
out
all
right
though
he
give
me
a
good
many
pointers
i
never
did
nothin
about
to
name
no
names
but
galilee
means
pork
an
as
i
ben
watchin
the
market
fer
quite
a
spell
myself
standard
pork
a
good
deal
lower
it
costs
to
pack
it
i
made
up
my
mind
to
buy
a
few
thousan
barrels
fer
use
it
a
handy
thing
to
have
in
the
house
declared
harum
an
i
thought
mebbe
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
fer
you
to
have
a
little
it
looks
cheap
to
me
he
added
an
mebbe
what
you
do
eat
you
sell
well
said
john
laughing
you
see
me
at
table
every
day
and
know
what
my
appetite
is
like
how
much
pork
do
you
think
i
could
take
care
of
at
the
present
price
said
david
i
think
about
four
barrels
would
give
ye
enough
to
eat
fer
a
spell
an
mebbe
leave
ye
a
few
barrels
to
dispose
of
if
you
should
happen
to
strike
a
feller
later
on
that
wanted
it
wuss
you
did
john
opened
his
eyes
a
little
i
should
only
have
a
margin
of
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
he
said
i
got
a
notion
that
that
carry
ye
said
david
it
may
go
lower
what
it
is
now
i
never
bought
anythin
yet
that
did
drop
some
an
i
guess
nobody
but
a
fool
ever
did
buy
at
the
bottom
once
but
i
had
an
idee
for
some
time
that
it
was
about
bottom
this
here
telegraph
would
ben
sent
if
the
feller
that
sent
it
did
think
so
too
an
i
had
some
other
with
him
harum
paused
and
laughed
a
little
i
was
jest
thinkin
he
continued
of
what
the
irishman
said
about
stofford
never
ben
there
have
ye
it
a
place
eight
nine
mile
f
here
an
the
hills
are
so
steep
that
when
you
goin
up
you
look
right
back
under
the
buggy
by
jest
leanin
over
the
edge
of
the
dash
i
was
drivin
there
once
an
i
met
an
irishman
with
a
big
drove
o
hogs
pat
i
says
all
them
hogs
come
from
he
says
i
says
would
thought
the
was
so
many
hogs
stofford
be
gobs
he
says
they
hogs
in
stofford
an
declared
david
the
bears
ben
sellin
that
pork
up
in
chicago
as
if
the
hull
everlastin
west
was
hogs
it
very
tempting
said
john
thoughtfully
said
david
i
do
want
to
tempt
ye
an
certain
i
do
want
to
urge
ye
the
ai
no
sure
things
but
death
an
taxes
as
the
sayin
is
but
buyin
pork
at
these
prices
is
buyin
that
got
value
an
you
ca
wipe
it
out
in
other
words
it
a
warranted
article
at
a
price
lower
it
be
produced
for
an
though
it
may
go
lower
if
a
man
it
bound
to
level
up
in
the
long
run
our
friend
sat
for
some
minutes
apparently
looking
into
the
fire
but
he
was
not
conscious
of
seeing
anything
at
all
finally
he
rose
went
over
to
harum
desk
figured
the
interest
on
the
certificates
up
to
the
first
of
january
indorsed
them
and
filling
up
a
check
for
the
balance
of
the
amount
in
question
handed
the
check
and
certificate
to
david
think
you
go
it
eh
said
the
latter
yes
said
john
but
if
i
take
the
quantity
you
suggest
i
shall
have
nothing
to
remargin
the
trade
in
case
the
market
goes
below
a
certain
point
i
thought
of
that
replied
david
an
was
goin
to
say
to
you
that
i
carry
the
trade
down
as
fur
as
your
money
would
go
in
case
more
margins
had
to
be
called
very
well
said
john
and
will
you
look
after
the
whole
matter
for
me
all
right
said
david
john
thanked
him
and
returned
to
the
front
room
there
were
times
in
the
months
which
followed
when
our
friend
had
reason
to
wish
that
all
swine
had
perished
with
those
whom
shylock
said
your
prophet
the
nazarite
conjured
the
devil
into
and
the
news
of
the
world
in
general
was
of
secondary
importance
compared
with
the
market
reports
after
the
purchase
pork
dropped
off
a
little
and
hung
about
the
lower
figure
for
some
time
then
it
began
to
advance
by
degrees
until
the
quotation
was
a
dollar
above
the
purchase
price
john
impulse
was
to
sell
but
david
made
no
sign
the
market
held
firm
for
a
while
even
going
a
little
higher
then
it
began
to
drop
rather
more
rapidly
than
it
had
advanced
to
about
what
the
pork
had
cost
and
for
a
long
period
fluctuated
only
a
few
cents
one
way
or
the
other
this
was
followed
by
a
steady
decline
to
the
extent
of
and
as
the
reports
came
it
looked
like
going
lower
which
it
did
in
fact
there
came
a
day
when
it
was
so
low
and
so
much
more
looked
like
going
lower
than
ever
as
such
things
usually
do
when
the
bottom
is
pretty
nearly
reached
that
our
friend
had
not
the
courage
to
examine
the
market
reports
for
the
next
two
days
and
simply
tried
to
keep
the
subject
out
of
his
mind
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
the
syrchester
paper
was
brought
in
about
ten
as
usual
and
laid
on
harum
desk
john
shivered
a
little
and
for
some
time
refrained
from
looking
at
it
at
last
more
by
impulse
than
intention
he
went
into
the
back
room
and
glanced
at
the
first
page
without
taking
the
paper
in
his
hands
one
of
the
press
dispatches
was
headed
great
excitement
on
chicago
board
of
trade
pork
market
reported
cornered
bears
on
the
run
and
more
of
the
same
sort
which
struck
our
friend
as
being
the
most
profitable
instructive
and
delightful
literature
that
he
had
ever
come
across
david
had
been
in
syrchester
the
two
days
previous
returning
the
evening
before
just
then
he
came
into
the
office
and
john
handed
him
the
paper
he
said
holding
it
off
at
arm
length
and
then
putting
on
his
glasses
them
fellers
that
thought
they
was
hogs
up
west
are
havin
a
change
of
heart
are
they
i
reckoned
they
would
they
got
through
with
it
it
ben
ruther
a
long
pull
though
eh
he
said
looking
at
john
with
a
grin
yes
said
our
friend
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
things
looked
ruther
colicky
the
last
two
three
days
eh
suggested
david
did
you
think
jig
was
up
an
the
monkey
was
in
the
box
rather
said
john
the
fact
is
he
admitted
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
for
a
few
days
back
i
have
looked
at
a
quotation
i
suppose
you
must
have
carried
me
to
some
extent
how
much
was
it
said
david
i
kept
the
trade
margined
of
course
an
if
sold
out
at
the
bottom
you
have
owed
me
somewhere
along
a
thousan
or
fifteen
hunderd
but
he
added
it
was
only
in
the
slump
an
last
long
an
anyway
i
to
carry
that
pork
to
where
it
would
ketched
fire
i
worried
none
an
you
did
let
on
to
be
an
so
i
did
say
anythin
what
do
you
think
about
it
now
asked
john
my
opinion
is
now
replied
harum
that
it
goin
to
putty
near
where
it
belongs
an
mebbe
higher
an
them
my
advices
we
can
sell
now
at
some
profit
an
of
course
the
bears
jump
on
agin
as
it
goes
up
an
the
other
fellers
take
the
profits
f
time
to
time
if
i
was
where
i
could
watch
the
market
i
mebbe
try
to
make
a
turn
in
but
i
guess
as
is
we
better
set
down
an
let
her
take
her
own
gait
i
do
mean
to
try
an
git
the
top
price
i
alwus
willin
to
let
the
other
feller
make
a
little
but
we
waited
fer
quite
a
spell
an
as
it
goin
our
way
we
might
well
wait
a
little
longer
all
right
said
john
and
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
sho
sho
said
david
it
was
not
until
august
however
that
the
deal
was
finally
closed
out
chapter
xliii
the
summer
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
season
so
far
as
the
social
part
of
it
was
concerned
had
been
what
john
had
grown
accustomed
to
in
previous
years
and
there
were
few
changes
in
or
among
the
people
whom
he
had
come
to
know
very
well
save
those
which
a
few
years
make
in
young
people
some
increase
of
importance
in
demeanor
on
the
part
of
the
young
men
whose
razors
were
coming
into
requisition
and
the
changes
from
short
to
long
skirts
from
braids
and
to
more
elaborate
coiffures
on
the
part
of
the
young
women
the
most
notable
event
had
been
the
reopening
of
the
verjoos
house
which
had
been
closed
for
two
summers
and
the
return
of
the
family
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
young
man
whom
miss
clara
had
met
abroad
and
who
represented
himself
as
the
acknowledged
of
that
young
woman
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
discussions
of
the
event
and
upon
the
appearance
manners
prospects
of
that
fortunate
gentleman
had
formed
a
very
considerable
part
of
the
talk
of
the
season
among
the
summer
people
and
indeed
interest
in
the
affair
had
permeated
all
grades
and
classes
of
society
it
was
some
six
weeks
after
the
settlement
of
the
transaction
in
pork
that
david
and
john
were
driving
together
in
the
afternoon
as
they
had
so
often
done
in
the
last
five
years
they
had
got
to
that
point
of
understanding
where
neither
felt
constrained
to
talk
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
up
conversation
and
often
in
their
long
drives
there
was
little
said
by
either
of
them
the
young
man
was
never
what
is
called
a
great
talker
and
harum
did
not
always
git
goin
on
this
occasion
they
had
gone
along
for
some
time
smoking
in
silence
each
man
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
finally
david
turned
to
his
companion
do
you
know
that
dutchman
claricy
verjoos
is
goin
to
marry
he
asked
yes
replied
john
laughing
i
have
met
him
a
number
of
times
but
he
is
a
dutchman
what
gave
you
that
idea
i
heard
it
was
over
in
germany
she
run
across
him
said
david
i
believe
that
is
so
but
he
is
a
german
he
is
from
philadelphia
and
is
a
friend
of
the
bradways
what
kind
of
a
feller
is
he
good
enough
for
her
well
said
john
smiling
in
the
sense
in
which
that
question
is
usually
taken
i
should
say
yes
he
has
good
looks
good
manners
a
good
deal
of
money
i
am
told
and
it
is
said
that
miss
clara
which
is
the
main
point
after
all
is
very
much
in
love
with
him
h
said
david
after
a
moment
how
do
you
git
along
with
the
verjoos
girls
was
claricy
ears
pointed
all
right
when
you
seen
her
fust
after
she
come
home
oh
yes
replied
john
smiling
she
and
her
sister
were
perfectly
pleasant
and
cordial
and
miss
verjoos
and
i
are
on
very
friendly
terms
i
was
thinkin
said
david
that
you
an
claricy
might
be
got
to
likin
each
other
an
mebbe
i
do
think
there
could
ever
have
been
the
smallest
chance
of
it
declared
john
hastily
take
the
lines
a
minute
said
david
handing
them
to
his
companion
after
stopping
the
horses
the
nigh
one
picked
up
a
stone
i
guess
and
he
got
out
to
investigate
the
river
road
he
remarked
as
he
climbed
back
into
the
buggy
after
removing
the
stone
from
the
foot
is
about
the
puttiest
road
here
but
i
do
drive
it
oftener
jest
on
account
of
them
dum
loose
stuns
he
sucked
the
air
through
his
lips
producing
a
little
squeaking
sound
and
the
horses
started
forward
presently
he
turned
to
john
did
you
ever
think
of
gettin
married
he
asked
well
said
our
friend
with
a
little
hesitation
i
do
remember
that
i
ever
did
very
definitely
somebody
you
knew
you
come
up
here
said
david
jumping
at
a
conclusion
yes
said
john
smiling
a
little
at
the
question
would
she
have
ye
queried
david
who
stuck
at
no
trifles
when
in
pursuit
of
information
john
laughed
i
never
asked
her
he
replied
in
truth
a
little
surprised
at
his
own
willingness
to
be
questioned
did
ye
to
when
the
time
come
right
pursued
harum
of
this
part
of
his
history
john
had
of
course
never
spoken
to
david
there
had
been
a
time
when
if
not
resenting
the
attempt
upon
his
confidence
he
would
have
made
it
plain
that
he
did
not
wish
to
discuss
the
matter
and
the
old
wound
still
gave
him
twinges
but
he
had
not
only
come
to
know
his
questioner
very
well
but
to
be
much
attached
to
him
he
knew
too
that
the
elder
man
would
ask
him
nothing
save
in
the
way
of
kindness
for
he
had
had
a
hundred
proofs
of
that
and
now
so
far
from
feeling
reluctant
to
take
his
companion
into
his
confidence
he
rather
welcomed
the
idea
he
was
withal
a
bit
curious
to
ascertain
the
drift
of
the
inquiry
knowing
that
david
though
sometimes
working
in
devious
ways
rarely
started
without
an
intention
and
so
he
answered
the
question
and
what
followed
as
he
might
have
told
his
story
to
a
woman
an
did
you
never
git
no
note
nor
message
nor
word
of
any
kind
asked
david
no
nor
hai
ever
heard
a
word
about
her
f
that
day
to
this
no
nor
hai
ever
tried
to
no
said
john
what
would
have
been
the
use
seemed
to
made
a
putty
clean
sweep
in
your
matters
that
spring
did
it
it
seemed
so
to
me
said
john
nothing
more
was
said
for
a
minute
or
two
harum
appeared
to
have
abandoned
the
pursuit
of
the
subject
of
his
questions
at
last
he
said
you
ben
here
most
five
years
very
nearly
john
replied
ben
putty
contented
on
the
hull
i
have
grown
to
be
said
john
indeed
it
hard
to
realize
at
times
that
i
have
always
lived
in
homeville
i
remember
my
former
life
as
if
it
were
something
i
have
read
in
a
book
there
was
a
john
lenox
in
it
but
he
seems
to
me
sometimes
more
like
a
character
in
a
story
than
myself
an
yet
said
david
turning
toward
him
if
you
was
to
go
back
to
it
this
last
five
years
git
to
be
that
way
to
ye
a
good
deal
quicker
do
ye
think
so
perhaps
so
replied
john
yes
he
added
thoughtfully
it
is
possible
i
guess
on
the
hull
though
remarked
harum
you
done
better
up
here
in
the
country
you
might
some
else
oh
yes
said
john
sincerely
thanks
to
you
i
have
indeed
and
an
ne
mind
about
me
you
got
quite
a
little
bunch
o
money
together
now
i
was
thinkin
mebbe
you
might
feel
you
need
to
stay
here
no
longer
if
you
did
want
to
the
young
man
turned
to
the
speaker
inquiringly
but
harum
face
was
straight
to
the
front
and
betrayed
nothing
it
would
be
no
more
natural
he
went
on
an
mebbe
it
would
be
best
for
ye
you
too
good
a
man
to
spend
all
your
days
workin
fer
dave
harum
an
i
had
it
in
my
mind
fer
some
time
somethin
like
that
pork
deal
to
make
you
a
little
independent
in
case
anythin
should
happen
an
i
could
give
ye
no
money
you
took
it
even
if
i
wanted
to
but
now
you
got
it
why
i
feel
very
much
as
if
you
had
given
it
to
me
protested
the
young
man
david
put
up
his
hand
no
no
he
said
all
i
did
was
to
propose
the
thing
to
ye
an
to
put
up
a
little
money
fer
two
three
days
i
did
take
no
chances
an
it
all
right
an
it
an
it
makes
ye
to
a
certain
extent
independent
of
homeville
i
do
quite
see
it
so
said
john
said
david
turning
to
him
if
you
had
as
much
five
years
ago
you
would
come
here
would
ye
john
was
silent
what
i
was
leadin
up
to
resumed
harum
after
a
moment
is
this
i
ben
thinkin
about
it
fer
some
time
but
i
have
wanted
to
speak
to
ye
about
it
before
in
fact
i
might
put
it
off
some
longer
if
things
as
they
are
but
the
fact
o
the
matter
is
that
i
to
take
down
my
sign
john
looked
at
him
in
undisguised
amazement
not
unmixed
with
consternation
yes
said
david
obviously
avoiding
the
other
eye
harum
banker
is
goin
to
come
down
i
gettin
to
be
an
old
man
he
went
on
an
what
with
some
investments
i
got
an
a
once
in
a
while
i
guess
i
manage
to
keep
the
fire
goin
in
the
kitchin
stove
fer
polly
an
me
an
the
ai
no
reason
why
i
sh
keep
my
sign
up
much
of
any
longer
of
course
he
said
if
i
was
to
go
on
as
i
be
now
i
want
ye
to
stay
jest
as
you
are
but
as
i
was
sayin
you
to
a
extent
independent
you
hai
no
speciul
ties
to
keep
ye
an
you
ought
anyway
as
i
said
before
to
be
doin
better
for
yourself
than
jest
drawin
pay
in
a
country
bank
one
of
the
most
impressive
morals
drawn
from
the
fairy
tales
of
our
childhood
and
indeed
from
the
literature
and
experience
of
our
later
periods
of
life
is
that
the
fulfilment
of
wishes
is
often
attended
by
the
most
unwelcome
results
there
had
been
a
great
many
times
when
to
our
friend
the
possibility
of
being
able
to
bid
farewell
to
homeville
had
seemed
the
most
desirable
of
things
but
confronted
with
the
idea
as
a
reality
for
what
other
construction
could
he
put
upon
david
words
except
that
they
amounted
practically
to
a
dismissal
though
a
most
kind
one
he
found
himself
simply
in
dismay
i
suppose
he
said
after
a
few
moments
that
by
down
your
sign
you
mean
going
out
of
business
figger
o
speech
explained
and
your
determination
is
not
only
a
great
surprise
to
me
but
grieves
me
very
much
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
more
sorry
than
i
can
tell
you
as
you
remind
me
if
i
leave
homeville
i
shall
not
go
almost
penniless
as
i
came
but
i
shall
leave
with
great
regret
and
indeed
ah
well
he
broke
off
with
a
wave
of
his
hands
what
was
you
goin
to
say
asked
david
after
a
moment
his
eyes
on
the
horizon
i
ca
say
very
much
more
replied
the
young
man
than
that
i
am
very
sorry
there
have
been
times
he
added
as
you
may
understand
when
i
have
been
restless
and
discouraged
for
a
while
particularly
at
first
but
i
can
see
now
that
on
the
whole
i
have
been
far
from
unhappy
here
your
house
has
grown
to
be
more
a
real
home
than
any
i
have
ever
known
and
you
and
your
sister
are
like
my
own
people
what
you
say
that
i
ought
not
to
look
forward
to
spending
my
life
behind
the
counter
of
a
village
bank
on
a
salary
may
be
true
but
i
am
not
at
present
at
least
a
very
ambitious
person
nor
i
am
afraid
a
very
clever
one
in
the
way
of
getting
on
in
the
world
and
the
idea
of
breaking
out
for
myself
even
if
that
were
all
to
be
considered
is
not
a
cheerful
one
i
am
afraid
all
this
sounds
rather
selfish
to
you
when
as
i
can
see
you
have
deferred
your
plans
for
my
sake
and
after
all
else
that
you
have
done
for
me
i
guess
i
lay
it
up
agin
ye
said
david
quietly
they
drove
along
in
silence
for
a
while
may
i
ask
said
john
at
length
when
you
intend
to
down
your
sign
as
you
put
it
whenever
you
say
the
word
declared
david
with
a
chuckle
and
a
side
glance
at
his
companion
john
turned
in
bewilderment
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
said
david
with
another
short
laugh
fur
the
sign
concerned
i
we
stick
a
new
one
over
it
but
i
guess
it
might
well
come
down
but
we
settle
that
matter
later
on
john
still
looked
at
the
speaker
in
utter
perplexity
until
the
latter
broke
out
into
a
laugh
got
any
idee
what
goin
onto
the
new
sign
he
asked
you
do
mean
yes
i
do
declared
harum
an
my
notion
this
an
do
you
say
aye
yes
nor
no
till
i
git
through
and
he
laid
his
left
hand
restrainingly
on
john
knee
the
new
sign
read
or
lenox
jest
as
you
elect
you
put
in
what
money
you
got
an
i
put
in
as
much
more
which
make
enough
in
an
any
extry
money
that
needed
up
to
a
certain
point
i
guess
i
manage
now
putty
much
all
the
new
has
come
in
through
you
an
practically
you
got
the
hull
thing
in
your
hands
you
do
the
work
about
doin
now
an
you
draw
the
same
an
after
that
paid
go
snucks
on
anythin
that
left
that
added
david
with
a
chuckle
if
you
feel
that
you
it
in
homeville
i
wish
you
was
married
to
one
of
our
homeville
girls
though
declared
harum
later
on
as
they
drove
homeward
chapter
xliv
since
the
and
measles
of
childhood
the
junior
partner
of
harum
company
had
never
to
his
recollection
had
a
day
illness
in
his
life
and
he
fought
the
attack
which
came
upon
him
about
the
first
week
in
december
with
a
sort
of
incredulous
disgust
until
one
morning
when
he
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
he
spent
the
next
week
in
bed
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
while
he
was
able
to
be
about
it
was
in
a
languid
and
spiritless
fashion
and
he
was
shaken
and
exasperated
by
a
persistent
cough
the
season
was
and
had
been
unusually
inclement
even
for
that
region
where
the
thermometer
sometimes
changes
fifty
degrees
in
hours
and
at
the
time
of
his
release
from
his
room
there
was
a
period
of
successive
changes
of
temperature
from
thawing
to
zero
and
below
a
characteristic
of
the
winter
climate
of
homeville
and
its
vicinity
hayes
exhibited
the
inevitable
quinine
iron
and
all
the
tonics
in
his
pharmacopoeia
with
cough
mixtures
and
sundry
but
in
vain
aunt
polly
pressed
bottles
of
sovereign
decoctions
and
infusions
upon
him
which
were
received
with
thanks
and
neglected
with
the
blackest
ingratitude
and
exhausted
not
only
the
markets
of
homeville
but
her
own
and
sairy
culinary
resources
no
mean
ones
by
the
way
to
tempt
the
appetite
which
would
not
respond
one
week
followed
another
without
any
improvement
in
his
condition
and
indeed
as
time
went
on
he
fell
into
a
condition
of
irritable
listlessness
which
filled
his
partner
with
concern
what
the
matter
with
him
doc
said
david
to
the
physician
he
do
seem
to
take
no
more
than
a
foundered
hoss
ca
ye
do
nothin
for
him
not
much
use
dosin
him
replied
the
doctor
pull
out
all
right
may
be
come
warm
weather
big
strong
fellow
but
this
cussed
influenzy
or
grip
as
they
call
it
sometimes
hits
them
hardest
warm
weather
some
way
off
remarked
harum
an
he
coughs
enough
to
tear
his
head
off
sometimes
the
doctor
nodded
ought
to
clear
out
somewhere
he
said
do
like
that
cough
myself
what
do
you
mean
asked
david
ought
to
go
for
a
spell
said
the
doctor
quit
working
and
get
a
change
of
climate
have
you
told
him
so
asked
harum
yes
replied
the
doctor
said
he
could
get
away
said
david
thoughtfully
pinching
his
lower
lip
between
his
thumb
and
finger
a
day
or
two
after
the
foregoing
interview
john
came
in
and
laid
an
open
letter
in
front
of
david
who
was
at
his
desk
and
dropped
languidly
into
a
chair
without
speaking
harum
read
the
letter
smiled
a
little
and
turning
in
his
chair
took
off
his
glasses
and
looked
at
the
young
man
who
was
staring
abstractedly
at
the
floor
i
ben
rather
expectin
you
git
somethin
like
this
what
be
you
to
do
about
it
i
do
know
replied
john
i
do
like
the
idea
of
leasing
the
property
in
any
case
and
certainly
not
on
the
terms
they
offer
but
it
is
lying
idle
and
i
paying
taxes
on
it
as
i
said
i
ben
expectin
fer
some
time
they
be
after
ye
in
some
shape
you
got
this
this
mornin
yes
i
expect
you
sell
the
if
you
got
a
good
chance
would
ye
with
the
utmost
pleasure
said
john
emphatically
i
got
a
notion
they
buy
it
of
ye
said
david
if
handled
right
i
would
lease
it
if
it
was
mine
an
i
wanted
to
sell
it
an
yet
in
the
long
run
you
might
git
more
out
of
it
an
then
agin
you
might
he
added
i
do
know
anything
about
it
said
john
putting
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
in
a
fit
of
coughing
david
looked
at
him
with
a
frown
i
ben
aware
fer
some
time
that
the
was
a
movement
on
foot
in
your
direction
he
said
you
know
i
told
ye
that
i
ben
in
the
oil
once
on
a
time
an
i
hai
never
quite
lost
my
though
it
hai
ben
a
very
active
one
lately
an
some
fellers
down
there
have
kep
me
posted
some
the
ben
oil
found
near
where
located
an
the
prospectin
points
your
way
the
hull
thing
has
ben
kep
as
close
as
possible
an
the
holes
has
ben
plugged
but
the
oil
is
there
somewhere
now
it
like
this
if
you
lease
on
shares
an
they
strike
the
oil
on
your
mebbe
it
bring
you
more
money
but
they
might
strike
an
agin
they
might
sometimes
you
git
a
well
an
a
dry
hole
only
a
few
hunderd
feet
apart
nevertheless
they
want
to
drill
your
i
know
who
the
parties
is
these
fellers
that
wrote
this
letter
are
simply
actin
for
the
speaker
was
interrupted
by
another
fit
of
coughing
which
left
the
sufferer
very
red
in
the
face
and
elicited
from
him
the
word
which
is
always
greeted
with
laughter
in
a
theater
say
said
david
after
a
moment
in
which
he
looked
anxiously
at
his
companion
i
do
like
that
cough
o
i
do
thoroughly
enjoy
it
myself
was
the
rejoinder
seems
to
be
kind
o
growin
on
ye
do
it
i
do
know
said
john
i
was
talkin
with
doc
hayes
about
ye
said
david
an
he
allowed
you
ought
to
have
your
shoes
off
an
run
loose
a
spell
john
smiled
a
little
but
did
not
reply
spoke
to
you
about
it
did
he
continued
david
yes
an
you
told
him
you
could
git
away
yes
did
tell
him
you
would
go
if
you
could
did
ye
i
only
told
him
i
could
go
said
john
david
sat
for
a
moment
thoughtfully
tapping
the
desk
with
his
eyeglasses
and
then
said
with
his
characteristic
chuckle
i
had
a
letter
f
chet
timson
yestidy
john
looked
up
at
him
failing
to
see
the
connection
yes
said
david
he
out
fer
a
job
an
the
way
he
writes
i
guess
the
dander
putty
well
out
of
him
i
reckon
the
hai
ben
much
but
hay
in
manger
fer
quite
a
spell
remarked
harum
h
said
john
raising
his
brows
conscious
of
a
humane
but
very
faint
interest
in
timson
affairs
harum
got
out
a
cigar
and
lighting
it
gave
a
puff
or
two
and
continued
with
what
struck
the
younger
man
as
a
perfectly
irrelevant
question
it
really
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
senior
were
making
conversation
how
peleg
doin
these
days
was
the
query
very
well
was
the
reply
do
most
anythin
ca
he
a
brief
interruption
followed
upon
the
entrance
of
a
man
who
after
saying
laid
a
note
on
david
desk
asking
for
the
money
on
it
harum
handed
it
back
indicating
john
with
a
motion
of
his
thumb
the
latter
took
it
looked
at
the
face
and
back
marked
his
initials
on
it
with
a
pencil
and
the
man
went
out
to
the
counter
if
you
was
fixed
so
you
could
git
away
fer
a
spell
said
david
a
moment
or
two
after
the
customer
departure
where
would
you
like
to
go
i
have
not
thought
about
it
said
john
rather
listlessly
you
think
about
it
a
little
now
if
you
hai
got
no
pressin
engagement
do
seem
to
be
very
rushin
this
mornin
why
said
john
because
said
david
impressively
you
goin
somewhere
right
off
quick
you
git
ready
an
you
may
well
be
makin
up
your
mind
where
john
looked
up
in
surprise
i
do
want
to
go
away
he
said
and
if
i
did
how
could
i
leave
the
office
no
responded
harum
you
do
want
to
make
a
move
of
any
kind
that
you
do
actually
have
to
an
that
the
reason
fer
makin
one
f
what
the
doc
said
an
f
what
i
see
you
got
to
git
out
this
dum
climate
waving
his
hand
toward
the
window
against
which
the
sleet
was
beating
fer
a
spell
an
as
fur
the
office
goes
chet
timson
be
tickled
to
death
to
come
on
an
help
out
while
you
away
an
i
guess
us
we
mosey
along
some
gait
i
ai
to
the
yet
myself
he
added
with
a
grin
the
younger
man
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
with
brows
contracted
and
pulling
thoughtfully
at
his
moustache
there
is
that
matter
he
said
pointing
to
the
letter
on
the
desk
said
david
the
ai
no
tearin
hurry
that
an
any
way
i
was
goin
to
make
you
a
suggestion
to
put
the
matter
into
my
hands
to
some
extent
will
you
take
it
said
john
quickly
that
is
exactly
what
i
should
wish
in
any
case
if
you
want
i
should
replied
harum
would
you
want
to
give
full
power
attorney
or
jest
have
me
say
i
was
instructed
to
act
for
ye
i
think
a
better
way
would
be
to
put
the
property
in
your
name
altogether
said
john
do
you
think
so
said
david
thoughtfully
after
a
moment
i
had
thought
of
that
but
mebbe
i
handle
the
matter
better
if
you
was
to
do
that
i
know
the
parties
an
if
the
was
any
bluffin
to
be
done
either
side
mebbe
it
would
be
better
if
they
thought
i
was
playin
my
own
hand
at
that
point
peleg
appeared
and
asked
lenox
a
question
which
took
the
latter
to
the
teller
counter
david
sat
for
some
time
drumming
on
his
desk
with
the
fingers
of
both
hands
a
succession
of
violent
coughs
came
from
the
front
room
his
mouth
and
brows
contracted
in
a
wince
and
rising
he
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
went
slowly
out
of
the
bank
chapter
xlv
the
vaterland
was
advertised
to
sail
at
one
and
it
wanted
but
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
of
the
hour
after
assuring
himself
that
his
belongings
were
all
together
in
his
john
made
his
way
to
the
upper
deck
and
leaning
against
the
rail
watched
the
bustle
of
embarkation
somewhat
interested
in
the
people
standing
about
among
whom
it
was
difficult
in
instances
to
distinguish
the
passengers
from
those
who
were
present
to
say
farewell
near
him
at
the
moment
were
two
people
apparently
man
and
wife
of
middle
age
and
rather
distinguished
appearance
to
whom
presently
approached
with
some
evidence
of
hurry
and
with
outstretched
hand
a
very
well
dressed
and
pleasant
looking
man
ah
here
you
are
ruggles
john
heard
him
say
as
he
shook
hands
then
followed
some
commonplaces
of
good
wishes
and
farewells
and
in
reply
to
a
question
which
john
did
not
catch
he
heard
the
lady
addressed
as
ruggles
say
oh
did
you
see
her
we
left
her
on
the
lower
deck
a
few
minutes
ago
ah
here
she
comes
the
man
turned
and
advanced
a
step
to
meet
the
person
in
question
john
eyes
involuntarily
followed
the
movement
and
as
he
saw
her
approach
his
heart
contracted
sharply
it
was
mary
blake
he
turned
away
quickly
and
as
the
collar
of
his
ulster
was
about
his
face
for
the
air
of
the
january
day
was
very
keen
he
thought
that
she
had
not
recognized
him
a
moment
later
he
went
aft
around
the
and
going
forward
to
the
seated
himself
therein
and
took
the
passenger
list
out
of
his
pocket
he
had
already
scanned
it
rather
cursorily
having
but
the
smallest
expectation
of
coming
upon
a
familiar
name
yet
feeling
sure
that
had
hers
been
there
it
could
not
have
escaped
him
nevertheless
he
now
ran
his
eye
over
the
columns
with
eager
scrutiny
and
the
hands
which
held
the
paper
shook
a
little
there
was
no
name
in
the
least
like
blake
it
occurred
to
him
that
by
some
chance
or
error
hers
might
have
been
omitted
when
his
eye
caught
the
following
william
ruggles
new
york
ruggles
edward
ruggles
it
was
plain
to
him
then
she
was
obviously
traveling
with
the
people
whom
she
had
just
joined
on
deck
and
it
was
equally
plain
that
she
was
edward
ruggles
when
he
looked
up
the
ship
was
out
in
the
river
chapter
xlvi
john
had
been
late
in
applying
for
his
passage
and
in
consequence
the
ship
being
very
full
had
had
to
take
what
berth
he
could
get
which
happened
to
be
in
the
second
cabin
the
occupants
of
these
quarters
however
were
not
rated
as
passengers
the
vaterland
took
none
such
on
her
outward
voyages
and
all
were
on
the
same
footing
as
to
the
fare
and
the
freedom
of
the
ship
the
captain
and
the
orchestra
appeared
at
dinner
in
the
second
saloon
on
alternate
nights
and
the
only
disadvantage
in
the
location
was
that
it
was
very
far
aft
unless
it
could
be
considered
a
drawback
that
the
furnishings
were
of
plain
wood
and
plush
instead
of
carving
gilding
and
stamped
leather
in
fact
as
the
voyage
proceeded
our
friend
decided
that
the
was
pleasanter
than
the
one
amidships
and
the
cozy
more
agreeable
than
the
large
and
gorgeous
one
forward
consequently
for
a
while
he
rarely
went
across
the
bridge
which
spanned
the
opening
between
the
two
decks
it
may
be
that
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
reluctance
to
encounter
edward
ruggles
the
roof
of
the
second
cabin
was
when
there
was
not
too
much
wind
a
favorite
place
with
him
it
was
not
much
frequented
as
most
of
those
who
spent
their
time
on
deck
apparently
preferred
a
place
nearer
amidships
he
was
sitting
there
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
out
looking
idly
over
the
sea
with
an
occasional
glance
at
the
people
who
were
walking
on
the
below
or
leaning
on
the
rail
which
bounded
it
he
turned
at
a
slight
sound
behind
him
and
rose
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
the
flush
in
his
face
as
he
took
the
hand
which
was
offered
him
reflected
the
color
in
the
face
of
the
owner
but
the
grayish
brown
eyes
which
he
remembered
so
well
looked
into
his
a
little
curiously
perhaps
but
frankly
and
kindly
she
was
the
first
to
speak
how
do
you
do
mr
lenox
she
said
how
do
you
do
mrs
ruggles
said
john
throwing
up
his
hand
as
at
the
moment
of
his
reply
a
puff
of
wind
blew
the
cape
of
his
mackintosh
over
his
head
they
both
laughed
a
little
this
was
their
greeting
after
nearly
six
years
and
sat
down
what
a
nice
place
she
said
looking
about
her
yes
said
john
i
sit
here
a
good
deal
when
it
is
too
windy
i
have
been
wondering
why
i
did
not
get
a
sight
of
you
she
said
i
saw
your
name
in
the
passenger
list
have
you
been
ill
i
in
the
second
cabin
he
said
smiling
she
looked
at
him
a
little
incredulously
and
he
explained
ah
yes
she
said
i
saw
your
name
but
as
you
did
not
appear
in
the
dining
saloon
i
thought
you
must
either
be
ill
or
that
you
did
not
sail
did
you
know
that
i
was
on
board
she
asked
it
was
rather
an
embarrassing
question
i
have
been
intending
he
replied
rather
lamely
to
make
myself
known
to
you
that
is
to
well
make
my
presence
on
board
known
to
you
i
got
just
a
glimpse
of
you
before
we
sailed
when
you
came
up
to
speak
to
a
man
who
had
been
saying
to
and
ruggles
i
heard
him
speak
their
name
and
looking
over
the
passenger
list
i
identified
you
as
edward
ruggles
ah
she
said
looking
away
for
an
instant
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
seen
me
and
i
wondered
how
you
came
to
address
me
as
ruggles
just
now
that
was
how
said
john
and
then
after
a
moment
it
seems
rather
odd
does
it
that
we
should
be
renewing
an
acquaintance
on
an
ocean
steamer
as
we
did
once
before
so
many
years
ago
and
that
the
first
bit
of
intelligence
that
i
have
had
of
you
in
all
the
years
since
i
saw
you
last
should
come
to
me
through
the
passenger
list
did
you
ever
try
to
get
any
she
asked
i
have
always
thought
it
very
strange
that
we
should
never
have
heard
anything
about
you
i
went
to
the
house
once
some
weeks
after
you
had
gone
said
john
but
the
man
in
charge
was
out
and
the
maid
could
tell
me
nothing
a
note
i
wrote
you
at
the
time
of
your
father
death
she
said
we
found
in
my
small
nephew
overcoat
pocket
after
we
had
been
some
time
in
california
but
i
wrote
a
second
one
before
we
left
new
york
telling
you
of
our
intended
departure
and
where
we
were
going
i
never
received
it
he
said
neither
spoke
for
a
while
and
then
tell
me
of
your
sister
and
he
said
my
sister
is
at
present
living
in
cambridge
where
jack
is
at
college
was
the
reply
but
poor
julius
died
two
years
ago
ah
said
john
i
am
grieved
to
hear
of
carling
death
i
liked
him
very
much
he
liked
you
very
much
she
said
and
often
spoke
of
you
there
was
another
period
of
silence
so
long
indeed
as
to
be
somewhat
embarrassing
none
of
the
thoughts
which
followed
each
other
in
mind
was
of
the
sort
which
he
felt
like
broaching
he
realized
that
the
situation
was
getting
awkward
and
that
consciousness
added
to
the
confusion
of
his
ideas
but
if
his
companion
shared
his
embarrassment
neither
her
face
nor
her
manner
betrayed
it
as
at
last
she
said
turning
and
looking
frankly
at
him
you
seem
very
little
changed
tell
me
about
yourself
tell
me
something
of
your
life
in
the
last
six
years
during
the
rest
of
the
voyage
they
were
together
for
a
part
of
every
day
sometimes
with
the
company
of
william
ruggles
but
more
often
without
it
as
her
husband
claimed
much
of
her
attention
and
rarely
came
on
deck
and
john
from
time
to
time
gave
his
companion
pretty
much
the
whole
history
of
his
later
career
but
with
regard
to
her
own
life
and
as
he
noticed
especially
the
two
years
since
the
death
of
her
she
was
distinctly
reticent
she
never
spoke
of
her
marriage
or
her
husband
and
after
one
or
two
faintly
tentative
allusions
john
forebore
to
touch
upon
those
subjects
and
was
driven
to
conclude
that
her
experience
had
not
been
a
happy
one
indeed
in
their
intercourse
there
were
times
when
she
appeared
distrait
and
even
moody
but
on
the
whole
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
just
as
he
had
known
and
loved
her
years
ago
and
all
the
feeling
that
he
had
had
for
her
then
broke
forth
afresh
in
spite
of
himself
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
as
he
told
himself
it
was
more
hopeless
than
ever
absolutely
so
indeed
it
was
the
last
night
of
their
voyage
together
the
ruggleses
were
to
leave
the
ship
the
next
morning
at
algiers
where
they
intended
to
remain
for
some
time
would
you
mind
going
to
the
he
asked
these
people
walking
about
fidget
me
he
added
rather
irritably
she
rose
and
they
made
their
way
aft
john
drew
a
couple
of
chairs
near
to
the
rail
i
do
care
to
sit
down
for
the
present
she
said
and
they
stood
looking
out
at
sea
for
a
while
in
silence
do
you
remember
said
john
at
last
a
night
six
years
ago
when
we
stood
together
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
leaning
over
the
rail
like
this
yes
she
said
does
this
remind
you
of
it
he
asked
i
was
thinking
of
it
she
said
do
you
remember
the
last
night
i
was
at
your
house
he
asked
looking
straight
out
over
the
moonlit
water
yes
she
said
again
did
you
know
that
night
what
was
in
my
heart
to
say
to
you
there
was
no
answer
may
i
tell
you
now
he
asked
giving
a
side
glance
at
her
profile
which
in
the
moonlight
showed
very
white
do
you
think
you
ought
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
or
that
i
ought
to
listen
to
you
i
know
he
exclaimed
you
think
that
as
a
married
woman
you
should
not
listen
and
that
knowing
you
to
be
one
i
should
not
speak
if
it
were
to
ask
anything
of
you
i
would
not
it
is
for
the
first
and
last
time
we
part
again
and
for
all
time
i
suppose
i
have
carried
the
words
that
were
on
my
lips
that
night
all
these
years
in
my
heart
i
know
i
can
have
no
response
i
expect
none
but
it
can
not
harm
you
if
i
tell
you
that
i
loved
you
then
and
have
she
put
up
her
hand
in
protest
you
must
not
go
on
lenox
she
said
turning
to
him
and
i
must
leave
you
are
you
very
angry
with
me
he
asked
humbly
she
turned
her
face
to
the
sea
again
and
gave
a
sad
little
laugh
not
so
much
as
i
ought
to
be
she
answered
but
you
yourself
have
given
the
reason
why
you
should
not
say
such
things
and
why
i
should
not
listen
and
why
i
ought
to
say
ah
yes
he
said
bitterly
of
course
you
are
right
and
this
is
to
be
the
end
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
you
will
never
again
speak
to
me
as
you
have
will
you
she
asked
i
should
not
have
said
what
i
did
had
i
not
thought
i
should
never
see
you
again
after
said
john
and
i
am
not
likely
to
do
that
am
i
if
i
could
be
sure
she
said
hesitatingly
and
as
if
to
herself
well
said
john
eagerly
she
stood
with
her
eyes
downcast
for
a
moment
one
hand
resting
on
the
rail
and
then
she
looked
up
we
expect
to
stay
in
algiers
about
two
months
she
said
and
then
we
are
going
to
naples
to
visit
some
friends
for
a
few
days
about
the
time
you
told
me
you
thought
you
might
be
there
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
we
said
but
if
after
we
get
home
you
are
to
spend
your
days
in
homeville
and
i
mine
in
new
york
we
shall
not
be
likely
to
meet
and
except
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
we
may
as
you
say
never
see
each
other
again
so
if
you
wish
you
may
come
to
see
me
in
naples
if
you
happen
to
be
there
when
we
are
i
am
sure
after
that
i
may
trust
you
may
i
not
but
she
added
perhaps
you
would
not
care
i
am
treating
you
very
frankly
but
from
your
standpoint
you
would
expect
or
excuse
more
frankness
than
if
i
were
a
young
girl
i
care
very
much
he
declared
and
it
will
be
a
happiness
to
me
to
see
you
on
any
footing
and
you
may
trust
me
never
to
break
bounds
again
she
made
a
motion
as
if
to
depart
do
go
just
yet
he
said
pleadingly
there
is
now
no
reason
why
you
should
for
a
while
is
there
let
us
sit
here
in
this
gorgeous
night
a
little
longer
and
let
me
smoke
a
cigar
at
the
moment
he
was
undergoing
a
revulsion
of
feeling
his
state
of
mind
was
like
that
of
an
improvident
debtor
who
while
knowing
that
the
note
must
be
paid
some
time
does
not
quite
realize
it
for
a
while
after
an
extension
at
last
the
cigar
was
finished
there
had
been
but
little
said
between
them
i
really
must
go
she
said
and
he
walked
with
her
across
the
hanging
bridge
and
down
the
deck
to
the
gangway
door
where
shall
i
address
you
to
let
you
know
when
we
shall
be
in
naples
she
asked
as
they
were
about
to
separate
care
of
cook
son
he
said
you
will
find
the
address
in
baedeker
he
saw
her
the
next
morning
long
enough
for
a
touch
of
the
hand
and
a
before
the
bobbing
tubby
little
boat
with
its
arab
crew
took
the
ruggleses
on
board
chapter
xlvii
how
john
lenox
tried
to
kill
time
during
the
following
two
months
and
how
time
retaliated
during
the
process
it
is
needless
to
set
forth
it
may
not
however
be
wholly
irrelevant
to
note
that
his
cough
had
gradually
disappeared
and
that
his
appetite
had
become
good
enough
to
carry
him
through
the
average
table
dinner
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
at
naples
he
found
a
cable
dispatch
at
the
office
of
cook
son
as
follows
sixty
cash
forty
stock
stock
good
harum
god
bless
the
dear
old
boy
said
john
fervently
the
pennsylvania
property
was
sold
at
last
and
if
stock
good
was
true
the
dispatch
informed
him
that
he
was
if
not
a
rich
man
for
modern
days
still
as
david
would
have
put
it
wuth
no
man
i
take
it
is
very
likely
to
receive
such
a
piece
of
news
without
satisfaction
but
if
our
friend
first
sensation
was
one
of
gratification
the
thought
which
followed
had
a
drop
of
bitterness
in
it
if
i
could
only
have
had
it
before
he
said
to
himself
and
indeed
many
of
the
disappointments
of
life
if
not
the
greater
part
come
because
events
are
unpunctual
they
have
a
way
of
arriving
sometimes
too
early
or
worse
too
late
another
circumstance
detracted
from
his
satisfaction
a
note
he
expected
did
not
appear
among
the
other
communications
waiting
him
at
the
bankers
and
his
mind
was
occupied
for
the
while
with
various
conjectures
as
to
the
reason
none
of
which
was
satisfactory
perhaps
she
had
changed
her
mind
perhaps
a
score
of
things
well
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
be
as
patient
as
possible
and
await
events
he
remembered
that
she
had
said
she
was
to
visit
some
friends
by
the
name
of
hartleigh
and
she
had
told
him
the
name
of
their
villa
but
for
the
moment
he
did
not
remember
it
in
any
case
he
did
not
know
the
hartleighs
and
if
she
had
changed
her
mind
as
was
possibly
indicated
by
the
omission
to
send
him
word
well
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
mechanically
lighted
a
cigarette
and
strolled
down
and
out
of
the
piazza
martiri
and
across
to
the
largo
della
vittoria
he
had
a
idea
of
walking
back
through
the
villa
nazionale
spending
an
hour
at
the
aquarium
and
then
to
his
hotel
for
luncheon
it
occurred
to
him
at
the
moment
that
there
was
a
steamer
from
genoa
on
the
monday
following
that
he
was
tired
of
wandering
about
aimlessly
and
alone
and
that
there
was
really
no
reason
why
he
should
not
take
the
said
steamer
and
go
home
occupied
with
these
reflections
he
absently
observed
just
opposite
to
him
across
the
way
a
pair
of
large
bay
horses
in
front
of
a
handsome
landau
a
coachman
in
livery
was
on
the
box
and
a
small
footman
very
much
coated
and
was
standing
about
and
as
he
looked
two
ladies
came
out
of
the
arched
entrance
to
the
court
of
the
building
before
which
the
equipage
was
halted
and
the
small
footman
sprang
to
the
carriage
door
one
of
the
ladies
was
a
stranger
to
him
but
the
other
was
william
ruggles
and
john
seeing
that
he
had
been
recognized
at
once
crossed
over
to
the
carriage
and
presently
having
accepted
an
invitation
to
breakfast
found
himself
sitting
opposite
them
on
his
way
to
the
villa
violante
the
conversation
during
the
drive
up
to
the
vomero
need
not
be
detailed
hartleigh
arrived
at
the
opinion
that
our
friend
was
rather
a
dull
person
ruggles
as
he
had
found
out
was
usually
rather
taciturn
neither
is
it
necessary
to
say
very
much
of
the
breakfast
nor
of
the
people
assembled
it
appeared
that
several
guests
had
departed
the
previous
day
and
the
people
at
table
consisted
only
of
and
ruggles
mary
and
hartleigh
and
their
two
daughters
and
john
whose
conversation
was
mostly
with
his
host
and
was
rather
desultory
in
fact
there
was
during
the
meal
a
perceptible
air
of
something
like
disquietude
ruggles
in
particular
said
almost
nothing
and
wore
an
appearance
of
what
seemed
like
anxiety
once
he
turned
to
his
host
when
ought
i
to
get
an
answer
to
that
cable
hartleigh
do
you
think
yes
i
should
say
so
without
doubt
was
the
reply
if
it
answered
promptly
and
in
fact
there
plenty
of
time
remember
that
we
are
about
six
hours
earlier
than
new
york
by
the
clock
and
it
only
about
seven
in
the
morning
over
there
coffee
was
served
on
the
balustraded
platform
of
the
flight
of
marble
steps
leading
down
to
the
grounds
below
mary
said
hartleigh
when
cigarettes
had
been
offered
you
want
to
show
lenox
something
of
la
violante
i
shall
take
you
to
my
favorite
place
she
said
as
they
descended
the
steps
together
the
southern
front
of
the
grounds
of
the
villa
violante
is
bounded
and
upheld
by
a
wall
of
tufa
fifty
feet
in
height
and
some
four
hundred
feet
long
about
midway
of
its
length
a
semicircular
bench
of
marble
with
a
rail
is
built
out
over
one
of
the
buttresses
from
this
point
is
visible
the
whole
bay
and
harbor
of
naples
and
about
one
third
of
the
city
lies
in
sight
five
hundred
feet
below
to
the
left
one
sees
vesuvius
and
the
sant
angelo
chain
which
the
eye
follows
to
sorrento
straight
out
in
front
stands
capri
and
to
the
right
the
curve
of
the
bay
ending
at
posilipo
the
two
john
and
his
companion
halted
near
the
bench
and
leaned
upon
the
parapet
of
the
wall
for
a
while
in
silence
from
the
streets
below
rose
no
rumble
of
traffic
no
sound
of
hoof
or
wheel
but
up
through
three
thousand
feet
of
distance
came
from
here
and
there
the
voices
of
the
clang
of
a
bell
and
ever
and
anon
the
pathetic
supplication
of
a
donkey
absolute
quiet
prevailed
where
they
stood
save
for
these
upcoming
sounds
the
april
sun
deliciously
warm
drew
a
smoky
odor
from
the
hedge
of
box
with
which
the
parapet
walk
was
bordered
in
and
out
of
which
darted
small
green
lizards
with
the
quickness
of
little
fishes
john
drew
a
long
breath
i
do
believe
there
is
another
such
view
in
the
world
he
said
i
do
not
wonder
that
this
is
your
favorite
spot
yes
she
said
you
should
see
the
grounds
the
whole
place
is
superb
but
this
is
the
glory
of
it
all
and
i
have
brought
you
straight
here
because
i
wanted
to
see
it
with
you
and
this
may
be
the
only
opportunity
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
apprehensively
you
heard
ruggles
question
about
the
cable
dispatch
she
said
yes
well
she
said
our
plans
have
been
very
much
upset
by
some
things
he
has
heard
from
home
we
came
on
from
algiers
ten
days
earlier
than
we
had
intended
and
if
the
reply
to
ruggles
cable
is
unfavorable
we
are
likely
to
depart
for
genoa
and
take
the
steamer
for
home
on
monday
the
reason
why
i
did
not
send
a
note
to
your
bankers
she
added
was
that
we
came
on
the
same
boat
that
i
intended
to
write
by
and
hartleigh
man
has
inquired
for
you
every
day
at
cook
so
that
hartleigh
might
know
of
your
coming
and
call
upon
you
john
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
dismay
her
face
was
very
still
as
she
gazed
out
over
the
sea
with
eyes
he
caught
the
scent
of
the
violets
in
the
bosom
of
her
white
dress
let
us
sit
down
she
said
at
last
i
have
something
i
wish
to
say
to
you
he
made
no
rejoinder
as
they
seated
themselves
and
during
the
moment
or
two
of
silence
in
which
she
seemed
to
be
meditating
how
to
begin
he
sat
bending
forward
holding
his
stick
with
both
hands
between
his
knees
absently
prodding
holes
in
the
gravel
i
think
she
began
that
if
i
did
not
believe
the
chances
were
for
our
going
i
would
not
say
it
john
bit
his
lip
and
gave
the
gravel
a
more
vigorous
punch
but
i
have
felt
that
i
must
say
it
to
you
some
time
before
we
saw
the
last
of
each
other
whenever
that
time
should
be
is
it
anything
about
what
happened
on
board
ship
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
yes
she
replied
it
concerns
all
that
took
place
on
board
ship
or
nearly
all
and
i
have
had
many
misgivings
about
it
i
am
afraid
that
i
did
wrong
and
i
am
afraid
too
that
in
your
secret
heart
you
would
admit
it
no
never
he
exclaimed
if
there
was
any
wrong
done
it
was
wholly
of
my
own
doing
i
was
alone
to
blame
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
you
were
married
and
perhaps
yes
i
did
remember
it
in
a
way
but
i
could
not
realize
it
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
your
husband
or
heard
of
your
marriage
he
was
a
perfectly
unreal
person
to
me
and
you
you
seemed
only
the
mary
blake
that
i
had
known
and
as
i
had
known
you
i
said
what
i
did
that
night
upon
an
impulse
which
was
as
unpremeditated
as
it
was
sudden
i
do
see
how
you
were
wrong
you
could
have
foreseen
what
took
place
and
have
you
not
been
sorry
for
what
took
place
she
asked
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
have
you
not
thought
the
less
of
me
since
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
there
was
a
little
smile
upon
her
lips
and
on
her
downcast
eyes
no
by
heaven
he
exclaimed
desperately
i
have
not
and
i
am
not
sorry
whether
i
ought
to
have
said
what
i
did
or
not
it
was
true
and
i
wanted
you
to
know
he
broke
off
as
she
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
and
a
blush
the
smile
was
almost
a
laugh
but
john
she
said
i
am
not
edward
ruggles
i
am
mary
blake
the
parapet
was
fifty
feet
above
the
terrace
the
hedge
of
box
was
an
impervious
screen
well
and
then
after
a
little
of
that
sort
of
thing
they
both
began
hurriedly
to
admire
the
view
again
for
some
one
was
coming
but
it
was
only
one
of
the
gardeners
who
did
not
understand
english
and
confidence
being
once
more
restored
they
fell
to
discussing
everything
do
you
think
you
could
live
in
homeville
dear
asked
john
after
a
while
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
shall
i
not
said
mary
and
are
you
too
really
happy
john
john
instantly
proved
to
her
that
he
was
but
it
almost
makes
me
unhappy
he
added
to
think
how
nearly
we
have
missed
each
other
if
i
had
only
known
in
the
beginning
that
you
were
not
edward
ruggles
mary
laughed
joyously
the
mistake
which
a
moment
before
had
seemed
almost
tragic
now
appeared
delightfully
funny
the
explanation
is
painfully
simple
she
answered
edward
ruggles
the
real
one
did
expect
to
come
on
the
vaterland
whereas
i
did
not
but
the
day
before
the
steamer
sailed
she
was
summoned
to
andover
by
the
serious
illness
of
her
only
son
who
is
at
school
there
i
took
her
ticket
got
ready
overnight
i
like
to
start
on
these
unpremeditated
journeys
and
here
i
am
john
put
his
arm
about
her
to
make
sure
of
this
and
kept
it
there
lest
he
should
forget
when
we
met
on
the
steamer
and
i
saw
the
error
you
had
made
i
was
tempted
and
yielded
to
let
you
go
on
uncorrected
but
she
added
looking
lovingly
up
into
john
eyes
i
glad
you
found
out
your
mistake
at
last
chapter
xlviii
a
fortnight
later
harum
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
office
of
harum
co
there
were
a
number
of
letters
for
him
but
the
one
he
opened
first
bore
a
foreign
stamp
and
was
postmarked
napoli
that
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
contents
of
this
epistle
was
manifest
from
the
beginning
not
only
from
the
expression
of
his
face
but
from
the
frequent
which
were
elicited
as
he
went
on
but
interest
grew
into
excitement
as
he
neared
the
close
and
culminated
as
he
read
the
last
few
lines
scat
my
cats
he
cried
and
grabbing
his
hat
and
the
letter
he
bolted
out
of
the
back
door
in
the
direction
of
the
house
leaving
the
rest
of
his
correspondence
to
be
digested
any
time
epilogue
i
might
in
conclusion
tell
how
john
further
life
in
homeville
was
of
comparatively
short
duration
how
david
died
of
injuries
received
in
a
runaway
accident
how
john
found
himself
the
sole
executor
of
his
late
partner
estate
and
save
for
a
life
provision
for
bixbee
the
only
legatee
and
rich
enough
if
indeed
with
his
own
and
his
money
he
had
not
been
so
before
to
live
wherever
he
pleased
but
as
heretofore
i
have
confined
myself
strictly
to
facts
i
am
to
be
consistent
constrained
to
abide
by
them
now
indeed
i
am
too
conscientious
to
do
otherwise
notwithstanding
the
temptation
to
make
what
might
be
a
more
artistic
ending
to
my
story
david
is
not
only
living
but
appears
almost
no
older
than
when
we
first
knew
him
and
is
still
just
as
likely
to
git
goin
on
occasion
even
old
jinny
is
still
with
us
though
her
master
does
most
of
his
joggin
behind
a
younger
horse
whatever
harum
testamentary
intentions
may
be
or
even
whether
he
has
made
a
will
or
not
nobody
knows
but
himself
and
his
attorney
aunt
polly
well
there
is
a
little
more
of
her
than
when
we
first
made
her
acquaintance
say
twenty
pounds
john
and
his
wife
live
in
a
house
which
they
built
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
it
is
a
settled
thing
that
david
and
his
sister
dine
with
them
every
sunday
bixbee
at
first
looked
a
little
askance
at
the
wine
on
the
table
but
she
does
not
object
to
it
now
being
a
son
she
has
never
been
induced
to
taste
any
champagne
but
on
one
occasion
she
was
persuaded
to
take
the
smallest
sip
of
claret
she
remarked
with
a
wry
face
i
guess
the
ca
be
much
sin
or
danger
drinkin
anythin
tastes
the
way
does
she
and
lenox
took
to
each
other
from
the
first
and
the
latter
has
quite
supplanted
and
more
miss
claricy
elton
with
david
in
fact
he
said
to
our
friend
one
day
during
the
first
year
of
the
marriage
say
john
i
ai
sure
but
what
we
have
to
hitch
that
wife
o
on
the
off
side
i
had
nearly
forgotten
one
person
whose
conversation
has
yet
to
be
recorded
in
print
but
which
is
considered
very
interesting
by
at
least
four
people
his
name
is
david
lenox
i
think
that
all
