proem
in
a
shaft
on
the
gravel
pits
a
man
had
been
buried
alive
at
work
in
a
deep
wet
hole
he
had
recklessly
omitted
to
slab
the
walls
of
a
drive
uprights
and
tailors
yielded
under
the
lateral
pressure
and
the
rotten
earth
collapsed
bringing
down
the
roof
in
its
train
the
digger
fell
forward
on
his
face
his
ribs
jammed
across
his
pick
his
arms
pinned
to
his
sides
nose
and
mouth
pressed
into
the
sticky
mud
as
into
a
mask
and
over
his
defenceless
body
with
a
roar
that
burst
his
broke
stupendous
masses
of
earth
his
mates
at
the
windlass
went
staggering
back
from
the
belch
of
violently
discharged
air
it
tore
the
to
strips
sent
stones
and
gravel
flying
loosened
planks
and
props
their
shouts
drawing
no
response
the
younger
and
nimbler
of
the
two
he
was
a
mere
boy
for
all
his
amazing
growth
of
beard
put
his
foot
in
the
bucket
and
went
down
on
the
rope
kicking
off
the
sides
of
the
shaft
with
his
free
foot
a
group
of
diggers
gathering
round
the
waited
for
the
tug
at
the
rope
it
was
quick
in
coming
and
the
lad
was
hauled
to
the
surface
no
hope
both
drives
had
fallen
in
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
was
blocked
the
crowd
melted
with
a
poor
bill
god
rest
his
soul
or
with
a
silent
shrug
such
accidents
were
not
infrequent
each
man
might
thank
his
stars
it
was
not
he
who
lay
cooling
down
below
and
so
since
no
more
washdirt
would
be
raised
from
this
hole
the
party
that
worked
it
made
off
for
the
nearest
to
wet
their
throats
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
and
to
discuss
future
plans
all
but
one
a
lean
and
man
of
some
five
and
forty
who
was
known
to
his
comrades
as
long
jim
on
hearing
his
mate
report
he
had
sunk
heavily
down
on
a
log
and
there
he
sat
a
pannikin
of
raw
spirit
in
his
hand
the
tears
coursing
ruts
down
cheeks
scabby
with
yellow
mud
his
eyes
glassy
as
marbles
with
those
that
had
still
to
fall
he
wept
not
for
the
dead
man
but
for
himself
this
accident
was
the
last
link
in
a
chain
of
that
had
been
forging
ever
since
he
first
followed
the
diggings
he
only
needed
to
put
his
hand
to
a
thing
and
luck
deserted
it
in
all
the
sinkings
he
had
been
connected
with
he
had
not
once
caught
his
pick
in
a
nugget
or
got
the
run
of
the
gutter
the
bottoms
had
always
proved
barren
drives
been
exhausted
without
his
raising
the
colour
at
the
present
claim
he
and
his
mates
had
toiled
for
months
overcoming
one
difficulty
after
another
the
slabbing
for
instance
had
cost
them
infinite
trouble
it
was
roughly
done
too
and
even
after
the
pins
were
in
great
flakes
of
earth
would
come
tumbling
down
from
between
the
joints
on
one
occasion
nearly
knocking
silly
the
man
who
was
below
then
before
they
had
slabbed
a
depth
of
three
times
nine
they
had
got
into
water
and
in
this
they
worked
for
the
next
sixty
feet
they
were
barely
rid
of
it
when
the
two
adjoining
claims
were
abandoned
and
in
came
the
flood
again
this
time
they
had
to
fly
for
their
lives
before
it
so
rapid
was
its
rise
not
the
strongest
man
could
stand
in
this
water
for
more
than
three
days
on
end
the
bark
slabs
stank
in
it
too
like
the
skins
in
a
tanner
yard
and
they
had
been
forced
to
quit
work
till
it
subsided
he
and
another
man
had
gone
to
the
hills
to
hew
trees
for
more
slabs
the
rest
to
the
from
there
when
it
was
feasible
to
make
a
fresh
start
they
had
to
be
dragged
some
blind
drunk
the
rest
blind
stupid
from
their
booze
that
had
been
the
hardest
job
of
any
keeping
the
party
together
they
had
only
been
eight
in
all
a
number
for
a
deep
wet
hole
then
one
had
died
of
dysentery
contracted
from
working
constantly
in
water
up
to
his
middle
another
had
been
nabbed
in
a
manhunt
and
clapped
into
the
logs
and
finally
but
a
day
or
two
back
the
three
men
who
completed
the
nightshift
had
deserted
for
a
new
rush
to
the
avoca
now
his
pal
had
gone
too
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
long
jim
to
do
but
to
take
his
dish
and
turn
fossicker
or
even
to
aim
no
higher
than
washing
over
the
tailings
rejected
by
the
fossicker
at
the
thought
his
tears
flowed
anew
he
cursed
the
day
on
which
he
had
first
set
foot
on
ballarat
it
for
white
men
that
what
it
is
another
drink
matey
and
fergit
yer
bloody
troubles
his
pannikin
drained
he
grew
warmer
round
the
heart
and
sang
the
praises
of
his
former
life
he
had
been
a
lamplighter
in
the
old
country
and
for
many
years
had
known
no
more
arduous
task
than
that
of
tramping
round
certain
streets
three
times
daily
ladder
on
shoulder
bitch
at
heel
to
attend
the
little
flames
that
helped
to
dispel
the
london
dark
and
he
might
have
jogged
on
at
this
up
to
three
score
years
and
ten
had
he
never
lent
an
ear
to
the
tales
that
were
being
told
of
a
wonderful
country
where
for
the
mere
act
of
stooping
and
with
your
naked
hand
you
could
pick
up
a
fortune
from
the
ground
might
the
rogues
who
had
spread
these
lies
be
damned
to
all
eternity
then
he
had
swallowed
them
only
too
willingly
and
leaving
the
old
woman
wringing
her
hands
had
taken
every
farthing
of
his
savings
and
set
sail
for
australia
that
was
close
on
three
years
ago
for
all
he
knew
his
wife
might
be
dead
and
buried
by
this
time
or
sitting
in
the
almshouse
she
could
not
write
and
only
in
the
early
days
had
an
occasional
newspaper
reached
him
on
which
alongside
the
queen
head
she
had
put
the
mark
they
had
agreed
on
to
show
that
she
was
still
alive
he
would
probably
never
see
her
again
but
would
end
his
days
where
he
was
well
they
would
be
many
this
was
not
a
place
that
made
old
bones
and
as
he
sat
worked
on
by
grief
and
liquor
he
was
seized
by
a
desperate
homesickness
for
the
old
country
why
had
he
ever
been
fool
enough
to
leave
it
he
shut
his
eyes
and
all
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
familiar
streets
came
back
to
him
he
saw
himself
on
his
rounds
of
a
winter
afternoon
when
each
lamp
had
a
halo
in
the
foggy
air
heard
the
of
his
behind
him
the
bump
of
the
ladder
against
the
prong
of
the
his
friend
the
policeman
glazed
stovepipe
shone
out
at
the
corner
from
the
distance
came
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
the
cries
of
the
he
remembered
the
glowing
charcoal
in
the
stoves
of
the
chestnut
and
potato
sellers
the
appetising
smell
of
the
shops
the
fragrant
steam
of
the
hot
dark
coffee
at
the
twopenny
stall
when
he
had
turned
shivering
out
of
bed
he
sighed
for
the
lights
and
jollity
of
the
hare
and
hounds
on
a
saturday
night
he
would
never
see
anything
of
the
kind
again
no
here
under
bare
blue
skies
out
of
which
the
sun
frizzled
you
alive
here
where
it
rain
without
at
once
being
a
flood
where
the
very
winds
blew
contrarily
hot
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
where
no
matter
how
great
the
heat
by
day
the
night
would
as
likely
as
not
be
nipping
cold
here
he
was
doomed
to
end
his
life
and
to
end
it
for
all
the
yellow
sunshine
more
hopelessly
knotted
and
gnarled
with
rheumatism
than
if
dawn
after
dawn
he
had
gone
out
in
a
cutting
or
groped
his
way
through
the
grey
sent
up
by
grey
thames
thus
he
sat
and
brooded
all
the
hatred
of
the
unwilling
exile
for
the
land
that
gives
him
burning
in
his
breast
who
the
man
was
who
now
lay
deep
in
a
grave
that
fitted
him
as
a
glove
fits
the
hand
careless
of
the
pass
to
which
he
had
brought
his
mate
who
this
really
was
long
jim
knew
no
more
than
the
rest
young
bill
had
never
spoken
out
they
had
chummed
together
on
the
tramp
from
melbourne
had
boiled
a
common
billy
and
slept
side
by
side
in
blankets
under
the
scanty
hair
of
a
that
was
in
the
days
of
the
first
great
stampede
to
the
goldfields
when
the
embryo
seaports
were
as
empty
as
though
they
were
and
every
man
who
had
the
use
of
his
legs
was
on
the
wide
bound
for
the
north
it
was
better
to
be
two
than
one
in
this
medley
of
lorries
carts
and
of
wheelbarrows
and
swagmen
where
the
air
rang
with
oaths
shouts
and
hammering
hoofs
with
and
in
this
of
thieves
bushrangers
and
foreigners
of
drunken
convicts
and
deserting
sailors
of
chinese
and
lascars
of
expirees
and
men
of
jews
turks
and
other
infidels
long
jim
himself
stunned
by
it
all
by
the
pother
of
landing
and
of
finding
a
roof
to
cover
him
by
the
ruinous
price
of
bare
necessaries
by
the
length
of
this
walk
that
lay
before
his
feet
long
jim
had
gladly
accepted
the
young
man
company
on
the
road
originally
for
no
more
than
this
at
heart
he
distrusted
young
bill
because
of
his
airs
and
intended
shaking
the
lad
off
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
diggings
there
a
man
must
for
sake
be
alone
when
he
stooped
to
pick
up
his
fortune
but
at
first
sight
of
the
strange
wild
scene
that
met
his
eyes
he
hastily
changed
his
mind
and
so
the
two
of
them
had
stuck
together
and
he
had
never
had
cause
to
regret
it
for
all
his
hands
and
finical
speech
young
bill
had
worked
like
a
nigger
standing
by
his
mate
through
the
latter
disasters
had
worked
till
the
ladyish
hands
were
horny
with
warts
and
corns
and
this
though
he
was
doubled
up
with
dysentery
in
the
hot
season
and
racked
by
winter
cramps
but
the
life
had
proved
too
hard
for
him
all
the
same
during
the
previous
summer
he
had
begun
to
drink
steadily
with
the
dogged
persistence
that
was
in
him
and
since
then
his
work
had
gone
downhill
his
sudden
death
had
only
been
a
of
the
inevitable
staggering
home
to
the
tent
after
nightfall
he
would
have
been
sure
sooner
or
later
to
fall
into
a
dry
shicer
and
break
his
neck
or
into
a
wet
one
and
be
drowned
on
the
surface
of
the
gravel
pit
his
fate
was
already
forgotten
the
rude
activity
of
a
in
full
swing
had
closed
over
the
incident
swallowed
it
up
under
a
sky
so
pure
and
luminous
that
it
seemed
like
a
thinly
drawn
veil
of
blueness
which
ought
to
have
been
transparent
stretched
what
from
a
short
way
off
resembled
a
desert
of
pale
clay
no
patch
of
green
offered
rest
to
the
eye
not
a
tree
hardly
a
stunted
bush
had
been
left
standing
either
on
the
bottom
of
the
vast
shallow
basin
itself
or
on
the
several
hillocks
that
dotted
it
and
formed
its
sides
even
the
most
prominent
of
these
the
black
hill
which
jutted
out
on
the
flat
like
a
gigantic
tumulus
had
been
stripped
of
its
dense
timber
feverishly
disembowelled
and
was
now
become
a
bald
protuberance
strewn
with
gravel
and
clay
the
whole
scene
had
that
strange
repellent
ugliness
that
goes
with
breaking
up
and
throwing
into
disorder
what
has
been
sanctified
as
final
and
belongs
in
particular
to
the
wanton
disturbing
of
earth
gracious
crust
in
the
era
this
wide
valley
lying
open
to
sun
and
wind
had
been
a
lovely
grassland
ringed
by
a
circlet
of
wooded
hills
beyond
these
by
a
belt
of
virgin
forest
a
limpid
river
and
more
than
one
creek
had
meandered
across
its
face
water
was
to
be
found
there
even
in
the
driest
summer
and
peppermint
had
given
shade
to
the
flocks
of
the
early
settlers
wattles
had
bloomed
their
brief
delirious
yellow
passion
against
the
foliage
of
the
gums
now
all
that
was
left
of
the
original
pleasant
and
its
pristine
beauty
were
the
ancient
volcanic
cones
of
warrenheip
and
buninyong
these
too
far
off
to
supply
wood
for
firing
or
slabbing
still
stood
green
and
timbered
and
looked
down
upon
the
havoc
that
had
been
made
of
the
fair
pastoral
lands
seen
nearer
at
hand
the
desert
resolved
itself
into
uncountable
pimpling
clay
and
of
divers
shade
and
varying
sizes
some
consisted
of
but
a
few
bucketfuls
of
mullock
others
were
taller
than
the
tallest
man
there
were
also
hundreds
of
tents
sheds
and
awnings
which
fell
from
a
kind
of
gallows
into
the
shafts
they
ventilated
flags
fluttering
on
high
posts
in
front
of
stores
the
many
human
figures
that
went
to
and
fro
were
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
ground
they
trod
they
were
coated
with
earth
in
ochre
and
gamboge
their
faces
were
daubed
with
clauber
it
matted
great
beards
and
entangled
the
coarse
hairs
on
chests
and
brawny
arms
where
here
and
there
a
blue
jumper
had
kept
a
tinge
of
blueness
it
was
so
besmeared
with
yellow
that
it
might
have
been
expected
to
turn
green
the
gauze
that
hung
from
the
brims
of
or
were
become
stiff
little
lattices
of
caked
clay
there
was
water
everywhere
from
the
spurs
and
gullies
round
about
the
autumn
rains
had
poured
freely
down
on
the
flat
river
and
creeks
had
been
over
their
banks
and
such
narrow
as
remained
between
the
tents
the
myriads
of
holes
that
abutted
one
on
another
jealous
of
every
inch
of
space
had
become
a
trough
of
mud
water
meandered
over
this
mud
or
carved
its
soft
way
in
channels
it
lay
about
in
puddles
thick
and
dark
as
it
filled
abandoned
shallow
holes
to
the
brim
from
this
scene
rose
a
blurred
hum
of
sound
rose
and
as
it
were
remained
stationary
above
it
like
a
which
no
wind
comes
to
drive
away
gradually
though
the
ear
made
out
in
the
conglomerate
of
noise
a
host
of
separate
noises
infinitely
multiplied
the
sharp
of
the
dull
thud
of
shovels
their
muffled
echoes
from
the
depths
below
there
was
also
the
continuous
squeak
and
groan
of
windlasses
the
bump
of
the
mullock
emptied
from
the
bucket
the
trundle
of
wheelbarrows
pushed
along
a
plank
from
the
mouth
to
the
nearest
pool
the
dump
of
the
dart
on
the
heap
for
washing
along
the
banks
of
a
creek
hundreds
of
cradles
rattled
and
grated
the
noise
of
the
spades
chopping
the
gravel
into
the
or
the
long
toms
was
like
the
scrunch
of
shingle
under
waves
the
fierce
yelping
of
the
dogs
chained
to
the
of
stores
mongrels
which
yapped
at
friend
and
foe
alike
supplied
a
note
of
earsplitting
discord
but
except
for
this
it
was
a
wholly
mechanical
din
human
brains
directed
operations
human
hands
carried
them
out
but
the
sound
of
the
human
voice
was
for
the
most
part
lacking
the
diggers
were
a
sombre
preoccupied
race
little
given
to
even
the
shepherds
who
in
waiting
to
see
if
their
neighbours
struck
the
lead
beguiled
the
time
with
euchre
and
lambskinnet
played
moodily
their
mouths
glued
to
their
they
were
to
fling
down
the
cards
for
pick
and
shovel
the
great
majority
in
their
indefatigable
busyness
neither
turned
a
head
nor
looked
up
backs
were
bent
eyes
fixed
in
a
hard
scrutiny
of
cradle
or
it
was
the
earth
that
held
them
the
familiar
homely
earth
whose
common
fate
it
is
to
be
trodden
heedlessly
underfoot
here
it
was
the
loadstone
that
drew
all
men
thoughts
and
it
took
toll
of
their
bodies
in
odd
exhausting
forms
of
labour
which
were
swift
to
weed
out
the
unfit
the
men
at
the
windlasses
spat
into
their
horny
palms
and
bent
to
the
crank
they
paused
only
to
pass
the
back
of
a
hand
over
a
sweaty
forehead
or
to
drain
a
nose
between
two
fingers
the
shoved
their
loads
the
bones
of
their
forearms
standing
out
like
ribs
beside
the
pools
the
puddlers
chopped
with
their
shovels
some
even
stood
in
the
tubs
and
worked
the
earth
with
their
feet
as
trample
grapes
the
cradlers
eternally
rocking
with
one
hand
held
a
long
stick
in
the
other
with
which
to
break
up
any
clods
a
careless
puddler
might
have
deposited
in
the
hopper
behind
these
came
the
great
army
of
fossickers
washers
of
equipped
with
knives
and
and
content
if
they
could
wash
out
to
the
dish
at
their
heels
still
others
who
treated
the
tailings
they
threw
away
and
among
these
last
was
a
sprinkling
of
women
more
than
one
with
an
infant
sucking
at
her
breast
withdrawn
into
a
group
for
themselves
worked
a
body
of
chinese
in
loose
blue
blouses
flappy
blue
and
huge
conical
straw
hats
they
too
fossicked
and
using
extravagant
quantities
of
water
thus
the
multitude
worried
the
surface
and
at
the
risk
and
cost
of
their
lives
probed
the
depths
now
that
deep
sinking
was
in
vogue
no
longer
served
as
a
for
the
gentleman
and
the
amateur
the
greater
number
of
those
who
toiled
at
it
were
seasoned
men
and
yet
although
it
had
now
sunk
to
the
level
of
any
other
arduous
and
uncertain
occupation
and
the
magic
prizes
of
the
early
days
were
seldom
found
something
of
the
old
romantic
glamour
still
clung
to
this
most
famous
dazzling
the
eyes
and
confounding
the
judgment
elsewhere
the
horse
was
in
use
at
the
and
machines
for
crushing
quartz
were
under
discussion
but
the
ballarat
digger
resisted
the
introduction
of
machinery
fearing
the
capitalist
machinery
would
bring
in
its
train
he
remained
the
dreamer
the
jealous
individualist
he
hovered
for
ever
on
the
brink
of
a
stupendous
discovery
this
dream
it
was
of
vast
wealth
got
without
exertion
which
had
decoyed
the
strange
motley
crowd
in
which
peers
and
churchmen
rubbed
shoulders
with
the
scum
of
norfolk
island
to
exile
in
this
outlandish
region
and
the
intention
of
all
alike
had
been
to
snatch
a
golden
fortune
from
the
earth
and
then
hey
presto
for
the
old
world
again
but
they
were
reckoning
without
their
host
only
too
many
of
those
who
entered
the
country
went
out
no
more
they
became
prisoners
to
the
soil
the
fabulous
riches
of
which
they
had
heard
tell
amounted
at
best
to
a
few
thousands
of
pounds
what
folly
to
depart
with
so
little
when
mother
earth
still
teemed
those
who
drew
blanks
nursed
an
unquenchable
hope
and
laboured
all
their
days
like
navvies
for
a
navvy
wage
others
again
broken
in
health
or
disheartened
could
only
turn
to
an
easier
handiwork
there
were
also
men
who
as
soon
as
fortune
smiled
on
them
dropped
their
tools
and
ran
to
squander
the
work
of
months
in
a
wild
debauch
and
they
invariably
returned
tail
down
to
prove
their
luck
anew
and
yet
again
there
were
those
who
having
once
seen
the
metal
in
the
raw
in
dust
fine
as
that
brushed
from
a
butterfly
wing
in
heavy
chubby
nuggets
or
more
exquisite
still
as
the
veining
of
quartz
these
were
gripped
in
the
subtlest
way
of
all
a
passion
for
the
gold
itself
awoke
in
them
an
almost
sensual
craving
to
touch
and
possess
and
the
glitter
of
a
few
specks
at
the
bottom
of
pan
or
cradle
came
in
time
to
mean
more
to
them
than
home
or
wife
or
child
such
were
the
fates
of
those
who
succumbed
to
the
unholy
hunger
it
was
like
a
form
of
revenge
taken
on
them
for
their
loveless
schemes
of
robbing
and
fleeing
a
revenge
contrived
by
the
ancient
barbaric
country
they
had
so
lightly
invaded
now
she
held
them
captive
without
chains
ensorcelled
without
witchcraft
and
lying
stretched
like
some
primeval
monster
in
the
sun
her
breasts
freely
bared
she
watched
with
a
malignant
eye
the
efforts
made
by
these
puny
mortals
to
tear
their
lips
away
part
i
chapter
i
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
clay
heaps
a
woman
shot
into
silhouette
against
the
sky
an
odd
figure
clad
in
a
skimpy
green
petticoat
with
a
scarlet
shawl
held
about
her
shoulders
wisps
of
frowsy
red
hair
standing
out
round
her
head
she
balanced
herself
on
the
slippery
earth
spinning
her
arm
like
the
vane
of
a
windmill
and
crying
at
the
top
of
her
voice
joe
boys
joe
joe
joey
it
was
as
if
with
these
words
she
had
dropped
a
live
shell
in
the
diggers
midst
a
general
stampede
ensued
in
which
the
cry
was
caught
up
echoed
and
till
the
whole
flat
rang
with
the
name
of
joe
tools
were
dropped
cradles
and
tubs
abandoned
windlasses
left
to
kick
their
cranks
backwards
many
of
the
workers
took
to
their
heels
others
in
affright
scuttled
aimlessly
hither
and
thither
like
barnyard
fowls
in
a
panic
summoned
by
shouts
of
up
with
you
boys
the
traps
are
here
numbers
ascended
from
below
to
see
the
fun
while
as
many
went
hurriedly
down
to
hiding
in
drive
or
chamber
even
those
diggers
who
could
pat
the
pocket
in
which
their
licence
lay
ceased
work
and
stood
about
with
sullen
faces
to
view
the
course
of
events
only
the
group
of
chinamen
washing
remained
unmoved
one
of
them
to
whom
the
warning
woman
belonged
raised
his
head
and
called
a
chinese
word
at
her
she
obeyed
it
instantly
vanished
into
thin
air
the
rest
went
impassively
on
with
their
fossicking
they
were
not
such
fools
as
to
try
to
cheat
the
government
of
its
righteous
dues
none
but
had
his
licence
safely
folded
in
his
nosecloth
and
thrust
inside
the
bosom
of
his
blouse
through
the
labyrinth
of
tents
and
mounds
a
cap
could
be
seen
approaching
then
a
jacket
came
into
view
the
white
star
on
the
forehead
of
a
mare
behind
the
commissioner
who
rode
down
thus
from
the
camp
came
the
members
of
his
staff
these
again
were
followed
by
a
body
of
mounted
troopers
they
drew
rein
on
the
slope
and
simultaneously
a
line
of
foot
police
backed
by
a
detachment
of
light
infantry
shot
out
like
an
arm
and
walled
in
the
flat
to
the
south
on
the
appearance
of
the
enemy
the
babel
redoubled
there
were
groans
and
along
with
the
derisive
joeys
the
rebel
diggers
hurled
any
term
of
abuse
that
came
to
their
lips
the
dolly
mops
the
skunks
the
bushrangers
oh
damn
damn
damn
their
bloody
eyes
it
rooshia
that
what
it
is
said
an
oldish
man
darkly
the
commissioner
a
solemn
man
with
brown
side
whiskers
let
the
reins
droop
on
his
mare
neck
and
sat
unwinking
in
the
tumult
his
mien
was
copied
by
his
staff
only
one
of
them
a
very
young
boy
who
was
new
to
the
colony
and
his
post
changed
colour
under
his
gaudy
cap
went
from
white
to
pink
and
from
pink
to
white
again
while
at
each
fresh
insult
he
gave
a
perceptible
start
and
gazed
dumbfounded
at
his
chief
insensitive
back
the
bloodhounds
had
begun
to
track
their
prey
rounding
up
with
a
skill
born
of
long
practice
they
drove
the
diggers
before
them
towards
the
centre
of
the
flat
here
they
passed
from
group
to
group
and
from
hole
to
hole
calling
for
the
production
of
licences
with
an
insolence
that
made
its
object
see
red
they
were
nice
of
scent
too
and
nine
times
in
ten
pounced
on
just
those
unfortunates
who
through
carelessness
or
lack
of
means
or
on
political
grounds
had
failed
to
take
out
the
month
licence
to
dig
for
gold
every
few
minutes
one
or
another
was
marched
off
between
two
constables
to
the
government
camp
for
fine
or
imprisonment
now
it
was
that
it
suddenly
entered
long
jim
head
to
cut
and
run
up
till
now
he
had
stood
declaring
himself
a
briton
who
might
be
drawn
and
quartered
if
he
ever
again
paid
the
blasted
tax
but
as
the
police
came
closer
a
spear
of
fright
pierced
his
befuddled
brain
and
inside
a
breath
he
was
off
and
away
had
the
abruptness
of
his
start
not
given
him
a
slight
advantage
he
would
have
been
caught
at
once
as
it
was
the
chase
would
not
be
a
long
one
the
clumsy
man
slithered
here
and
stuck
fast
there
dodging
obstacles
with
an
awkwardness
that
was
painful
to
see
he
could
be
heard
sobbing
and
cursing
as
he
ran
at
this
point
the
commissioner
half
turning
signed
to
the
troopers
in
his
rear
six
or
seven
of
them
shook
up
their
bridles
and
rode
off
their
scabbards
clinking
to
prevent
the
fugitive
escape
a
howl
of
contempt
went
up
from
the
crowd
the
pink
and
white
subaltern
made
what
was
almost
a
movement
of
the
arm
to
intercept
his
command
it
was
too
much
for
long
jim
last
mate
the
youthful
blackbeard
who
had
pluckily
descended
the
shaft
after
the
accident
he
had
been
standing
on
a
mound
with
a
posse
of
others
following
the
at
his
partner
dash
for
the
open
his
snorts
of
indignation
found
words
is
the
old
fool
gone
dotty
then
he
drew
a
whistling
breath
no
it
more
than
flesh
and
blood
stand
back
boys
and
though
he
was
as
little
burdened
with
a
licence
as
the
man
under
pursuit
he
shouted
help
help
for
god
sake
do
let
have
me
shot
down
the
slope
and
was
off
like
the
wind
his
foxly
object
was
attained
the
attention
of
the
hunters
was
diverted
long
jim
seizing
the
moment
vanished
underground
the
younger
man
ran
with
the
lightness
of
a
hare
he
had
also
the
hare
address
in
doubling
and
turning
his
pursuers
never
knew
did
he
pass
from
sight
behind
a
covert
of
tents
and
mounds
where
he
would
bob
up
next
he
avoided
shafts
and
pools
as
if
by
a
miracle
ran
along
greasy
planks
without
a
slip
and
where
these
had
been
removed
to
balk
the
police
he
jumped
the
holes
taking
risks
that
were
not
for
a
sane
man
once
he
fell
but
enslimed
from
head
to
foot
wringing
wet
and
hatless
was
up
again
in
a
twinkling
his
enemies
were
less
than
he
and
times
without
number
measured
their
length
on
the
oily
ground
still
one
of
them
was
gaining
rapidly
on
him
a
giant
of
a
fellow
with
long
thin
legs
and
soon
the
constable
foot
filled
the
prints
left
by
the
young
man
while
these
were
still
warm
it
was
a
fine
run
the
diggers
trooped
after
in
a
body
the
flat
rang
with
cheers
and
plaudits
even
the
commissioner
and
his
retinue
trotted
in
the
same
direction
eventually
the
runaway
must
land
in
the
arms
of
the
mounted
police
but
this
was
not
his
plan
making
as
though
he
headed
for
the
open
he
suddenly
dashed
off
at
right
angles
and
with
a
final
sprint
brought
up
dead
against
a
store
which
stood
on
rising
ground
his
adversary
was
so
close
behind
that
a
collision
resulted
the
digger
feet
slid
from
under
him
he
fell
on
his
face
the
other
on
top
in
their
fall
they
struck
a
huge
pillar
of
ingeniously
built
up
to
the
height
of
the
store
itself
this
toppled
over
with
a
crash
and
the
dishes
went
rolling
down
the
slope
between
the
legs
of
the
police
the
dog
chained
to
the
flagstaff
all
but
strangled
himself
in
his
rage
and
excitement
and
the
owner
of
the
store
came
running
out
purdy
you
what
in
the
name
of
the
digger
adroitly
rolled
his
captor
over
and
there
they
both
sat
side
by
side
on
the
ground
one
gripping
the
other
collar
both
too
blown
to
speak
a
cordon
of
puffing
constables
hemmed
them
in
the
storekeeper
frowned
you
no
licence
you
young
beggar
and
your
licence
you
scoundrel
demanded
the
leader
of
the
troop
the
prisoner
rejoinder
was
a
saucy
now
then
out
with
the
cuffs
joe
he
got
on
his
feet
as
bidden
but
awkwardly
for
it
appeared
that
in
falling
he
had
hurt
his
ankle
behind
the
police
were
massed
the
diggers
these
opened
a
narrow
alley
for
the
camp
officials
to
ride
through
but
their
attitude
was
hostile
and
there
were
cries
of
leave
go
yer
blackguards
after
sich
a
run
none
o
yer
bloody
quod
for
along
with
other
more
threatening
expressions
sombre
and
taciturn
the
commissioner
waved
his
hand
take
him
away
well
so
long
dick
said
the
culprit
jauntily
and
as
he
offered
his
wrists
to
be
handcuffed
he
whistled
an
air
here
the
storekeeper
hurriedly
interposed
no
stop
i
give
bail
and
darting
into
the
tent
and
out
again
he
counted
five
notes
into
the
constable
palm
the
lad
collar
was
released
and
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
mounted
from
the
crowd
at
the
sound
the
giver
made
as
if
to
retire
then
yielding
to
a
second
thought
he
stepped
forward
and
saluted
the
commissioner
a
young
sir
he
means
no
harm
i
send
him
up
in
the
morning
to
apologise
i
be
damned
if
you
do
muttered
the
digger
between
his
teeth
but
the
chief
refused
to
be
placated
good
day
doctor
he
said
shortly
and
with
his
staff
at
heel
trotted
down
the
slope
followed
till
out
of
earshot
by
a
mocking
fire
of
joes
lingering
in
the
rear
the
youthful
sympathiser
turned
in
his
saddle
and
waved
his
cap
the
raid
was
over
for
that
day
the
crowd
dispersed
its
members
became
orderly
men
once
more
the
storekeeper
hushed
his
frantic
dog
and
called
his
assistant
to
rebuild
the
pillar
of
tins
the
young
digger
sat
down
on
the
log
that
served
for
a
bench
and
examined
his
foot
he
pulled
and
pulled
causing
himself
great
pain
but
could
not
get
his
boot
off
at
last
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
he
cried
impatiently
dick
i
say
dick
mahony
give
us
a
drink
old
boy
i
at
this
the
storekeeper
a
tall
slenderly
built
man
of
some
seven
or
eight
and
twenty
appeared
bearing
a
jug
and
a
pannikin
oh
bah
said
the
lad
when
he
found
that
the
jug
held
only
water
and
on
his
friend
reminding
him
that
he
might
by
now
have
been
sitting
in
the
he
laughed
and
winked
i

of
all
the
confounded
impudence
faith
dick
and
d
think
i
did
see
how
your
hand
itched
for
your
pocket
the
man
he
called
mahony
flushed
above
his
fair
beard
it
was
true
he
had
made
an
involuntary
movement
of
the
hand
checked
for
the
rest
halfway
by
the
knowledge
that
the
pocket
was
empty
he
looked
displeased
and
said
nothing
do
be
afraid
i
pay
you
back
soon
ever
me
ship
comes
home
went
on
the
young
scapegrace
who
very
well
knew
how
to
play
his
cards
at
his
companion
heated
disclaimer
however
he
changed
his
tone
i
say
dick

a
look
at
my
foot
will

i
ca

this
damned
boot
off
the
elder
man
bent
over
the
injury
he
ceased
to
show
displeasure
purdy
you
young
fool
when
will
you
learn
wisdom
well
they
should
hunt
old
women
then
the
swine
gave
back
purdy
and
told
his
tale
oh
lor
there
go
six
canaries
for
at
his
wincing
and
shrinking
his
friend
had
taken
a
penknife
and
ripped
up
the
jackboot
now
practised
hands
explored
the
swollen
discoloured
ankle
when
it
had
been
washed
and
bandaged
its
owner
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
his
head
in
the
shade
of
a
barrel
and
went
to
sleep
he
slept
till
sundown
through
all
the
traffic
of
a
busy
afternoon
some
customers
came
and
went
the
greater
number
of
them
were
diggers
who
ran
up
for
it

a
coil
of
rope

of

richly
profane
paid
where
coin
was
scarce
in
from
a
and
hurried
back
to
work
but
there
also
came
old
harridans
as
often
as
not
diggers
themselves
whose
language
outdid
that
of
the
males
and
dirty
irish
mothers
besides
a
couple
of
the
white
women
who
inhabited
the
chinese
quarter
one
of
these
was
in
liquor
and
a
great
hullabaloo
took
place
before
she
could
be
got
rid
of
put
out
she
stood
in
front
of
the
tent
her
hair
hanging
down
her
back
cursing
and
reviling
respectable
women
as
well
did
an
afternoon
shopping
there
in
no
haste
to
be
gone
they
sat
about
on
empty
boxes
or
upturned
barrels
exchanging
confidences
while
weary
children
plucked
at
their
skirts
a
party
of
youngsters
entered
the
tallest
of
whom
could
just
see
over
the
counter
and
called
for
shandygaffs
the
assistant
was
for
chasing
them
off
with
hard
words
but
the
storekeeper
put
instead
a
stick
of
into
each
dirty
outstretched
hand
and
the
imps
retired
well
content
on
their
heels
came
a
digger
and
his
to
choose
a
and
all
the
gaudy
finery
the
store
held
was
displayed
before
them
a
red
velvet
dress
flounced
with
satin
a
pink
gauze
bonnet
white
satin
shoes
and
white
silk
stockings
met
their
fancy
the
irish
girl
blushed
and
dimpled
in
consulting
with
the
shopman
upon
the
stays
in
which
to
lace
her
ample
figure
the
digger
whose
very
pores
oozed
gold
planked
down
handfuls
of
dust
and
nuggets
and
brushed
aside
a
neat
paisley
shawl
for
one
of
yellow
satin
the
fellow
to
which
he
swore
to
having
seen
on
the
back
of
the
lady
herself
he
showered
on
the
children
and
bought
a
for
a
shabby
old
woman
then
producing
a
bottle
of
champagne
from
a
sack
he
bore
he
called
on
those
present
to
give
him
after
most
gracious
little
majesty
god
bless
the
estate
of
materimony
the
empty
bottle
smashed
for
luck
the
couple
departed
carrying
their
purchases
in
the
sack
and
the
rest
of
the
company
trooped
to
the
door
with
them
to
wish
them
joy
within
the
narrow
confines
of
the
tent
where
trailed
over
and
east
india
pickles
and
hessian
boots
lay
on
the
top
of
sugar
and
where
cheeses
rubbed
shoulders
with
tallow
candles
blue
and
red
serge
shirts
and
captain
biscuits
where
onions
and
guernseys
and
sardines
fine
combs
cigars
and
windsor
soap
tinned
coffee
and
hair
oil
revolvers
shovels
and
oxford
shoes
lay
in
one
grand
miscellany
within
the
crowded
store
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
air
grew
rank
and
oppressive
precisely
at
six
the
bar
was
let
down
across
the
door
and
the
storekeeper
withdrew
to
his
at
the
back
of
the
tent
here
he
changed
his
coat
and
meticulously
washed
his
hands
to
which
clung
a
subtle
blend
of
all
the
goods
that
had
passed
through
them
then
coming
round
to
the
front
he
sat
down
on
the
log
and
took
out
his
pipe
he
made
a
point
no
matter
how
brisk
trade
was
of
not
keeping
open
after
dark
his
evenings
were
his
own
he
sat
and
puffed
tranquilly
it
was
a
fine
night
the
first
showy
splendour
of
sunset
had
passed
but
the
upper
sky
was
still
aflush
with
colour
and
in
the
centre
of
this
frail
cloud
which
faded
as
he
watched
it
swam
a
single
star
chapter
ii
with
the
passing
of
a
cooler
air
the
sleeper
wakened
and
rubbed
his
eyes
letting
his
injured
leg
lie
undisturbed
he
drew
up
the
other
knee
and
buckled
his
hands
round
it
in
this
position
he
sat
and
talked
he
was
a
dark
young
man
of
middle
height
and
broadly
built
he
had
large
white
teeth
of
a
kind
to
crack
nuts
with
and
the
full
wide
flexible
mouth
that
denotes
the
generous
talker
what
a
it
is
to
be
sure
thought
his
companion
as
he
smoked
and
listened
in
a
gently
ironic
silence
to
abuse
of
the
government
he
knew
or
thought
he
knew
young
purdy
inside
out
but
behind
all
the
froth
of
the
boy
talk
there
lurked
it
seemed
a
purpose
no
sooner
was
a
meal
of
cold
chop
and
tea
over
than
purdy
declared
his
intention
of
being
present
at
a
meeting
of
malcontent
diggers
nor
would
he
even
wait
to
wash
himself
clean
of
mud
his
friend
reluctantly
agreed
to
lend
him
an
arm
but
he
could
not
refrain
from
taking
the
lad
to
task
for
getting
entangled
in
the
political
imbroglio
when
as
you
know
it
just
a
kind
of
sport
to
you
purdy
sulked
for
a
few
paces
then
burst
out
if
only
you
were
so
damned
detached
dick
mahony
you
restless
and
want
excitement
my
boy
that
the
root
of
the
trouble
well
i
jiggered
if
ever
i
knew
a
restless
mortal
it
yourself
the
two
men
picked
their
steps
across
the
flat
and
up
the
opposite
hillside
young
purdy
smith
limping
and
leaning
heavy
his
lame
foot
thrust
into
an
old
slipper
he
was
at
all
times
with
the
world
now
in
addition
his
plucky
exploit
of
the
afternoon
blazed
its
way
through
the
settlement
and
blarney
and
bravos
rained
upon
him
golly
for
you
purdy
old
showed
the
flag
did
what
you
take
me

come
on
in
for
a
drop
o
the
real
even
a
weary
old
strumpet
propping
herself
against
the
doorway
of
a
waved
a
tipsy
hand
and
cried
arrah

if

would
carry

and
purdy
laughed
and
relished
the
honey
and
had
an
answer
pat
for
everybody
especially
the
women
his
companion
on
the
other
hand
was
greeted
with
a
glibness
that
had
something
perfunctory
in
it
and
no
touch
of
familiarity
the
big
canvas
tent
on
bakery
hill
where
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
was
already
lighted
and
at
the
tinkle
of
a
bell
the
diggers
who
till
then
had
stood
cracking
and
hobnobbing
outside
began
to
push
for
the
entrance
the
bulk
of
them
belonged
to
the
race
that
is
quickest
to
resent
injustice
were
irish
after
them
in
number
came
the
germans
swaggering
and
voluble
and
the
inflammable
french
english
scotch
and
americans
formed
a
smaller
and
cooler
but
very
dogged
group
at
the
end
of
the
tent
a
rough
platform
had
been
erected
on
which
stood
a
row
of
cane
seats
in
the
body
of
the
hall
the
benches
were
formed
of
boards
laid
from
one
upturned
keg
or
tub
to
another
the
chair
was
taken
by
a
local
auctioneer
a
man
with
never
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
who
in
a
lengthy
discourse
and
with
the
single
monotonous
gesture
of
beating
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
back
of
the
other
strove
to
bring
home
to
his
audience
the
degradation
of
their
present
political
status
the
diggers
chewed
and
spat
and
listened
to
his
periods
with
the
shame
of
their
state
did
not
greatly
move
them
they
followed
too
with
composure
the
rehearsal
of
their
general
grievances
as
they
were
aware
said
the
speaker
the
legislative
council
of
victoria
was
made
up
largely
of
crown
nominees
in
the
election
of
members
the
population
had
no
voice
whatsoever
this
was
a
scandalous
thing
for
the
digging
constituent
outnumbered
all
the
rest
of
the
population
put
together
thus
forming
what
he
would
call
the
backbone
and
mainstay
of
the
colony
the
labour
of
their
hands
had
raised
the
colony
to
its
present
pitch
of
prosperity
and
yet
these
same
bold
and
hardy
pioneers
were
held
incapable
of
deciding
jot
or
tittle
in
the
public
affairs
of
their
adopted
home
still
unmoved
the
diggers
listened
to
this
recital
of
their
virtues
but
when
one
man
growing
weary
of
the
unctuous
wordiness
discharged
a
fierce
why
the
hell
do
yer
git
on
to
the
bloody
the
audience
was
fire
and
flame
in
an
instant
a
riotous
noise
ensued
rough
throats
rang
changes
on
the
question
order
restored
it
was
evident
that
the
speech
was
over
thrown
violently
out
of
his
concept
the
auctioneer
struck
and
struck
at
his
palm
in
vain
nothing
would
come
so
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
he
irately
sat
down
in
favour
of
his
successor
on
the
programme
this
speaker
did
not
fare
much
better
the
assemblage
roused
now
jolly
and
merciless
was
not
disposed
to
give
quarter
and
his
obtuseness
in
dawdling
over
such
notions
as
that
population
not
property
formed
the
basis
of
representative
government
reaped
him
a
harvest
of
boos
and
groans
this
was
not
what
the
diggers
had
come
out
to
hear
and
they
were
as
direct
as
children
in
their
demand
for
the
gist
of
the
matter
a
ol
shicer
was
the
unanimous
opinion
expressed
without
scruple
while
from
the
back
of
the
hall
came
the
curt
request
to
him
to
shut
his
next
on
the
list
was
a
german
a
man
with
whiskers
and
prominent
watery
eyes
he
could
not
manage
the
letter
in
the
body
of
a
word
where
it
was
negligible
he
rolled
it
out
as
though
it
stood
three
deep
did
he
tackle
it
as
an
initial
on
the
other
hand
his
tongue
seemed
to
cleave
to
his
palate
and
to
yield
only
an
this
quaint
defect
caused
some
merriment
at
the
start
but
was
soon
eclipsed
by
a
more
striking
oddity
the
speaker
had
the
habit
of
as
it
were
creaking
with
his
nose
after
each
few
sentences
he
paused
to
give
himself
time
to
produce
something
between
a
creak
and
a
snore
an
abortive
attempt
to
get
at
a
mucus
that
was
plainly
out
of
reach
the
diggers
were
beside
themselves
with
mirth
forgot
boys
look
slippy
a
for
ol
sausage
but
the
german
was
not
sensitive
to
ridicule
he
had
something
to
say
and
he
was
there
to
say
it
fixing
his
eyes
on
a
spot
high
up
the
tent
wall
he
kept
them
pinned
to
it
while
he
mouthed
out
invectives
he
was
it
seemed
a
revolutionist
a
fierce
denouncer
of
british
rule
he
declared
the
british
monarchy
to
be
an
effete
institution
the
fetish
of
british
freedom
to
have
been
exbloded
long
ago
what
they
needed
in
this
grand
young
country
of
theirs
was
a
republic
they
must
rid
themselves
of
those
shackles
that
had
been
forged
in
the
days
when
men
were
slaves
it
was
his
sound
conviction
that
before
many
weeks
had
passed
the
union
jack
would
have
been
hauled
down
for
ever
and
the
glorious
southern
cross
would
wave
in
its
stead
over
a
free
australia
the
day
on
which
this
happened
would
be
a
date
in
the
annals
of
the
country
for
what
he
would
like
to
know
had
the
british
flag
ever
done
for
freedom
at
any
time
in
the
world
history
they
should
read
in
their
and
there
they
would
learn
that
wherever
a
people
had
risen
against
their
tyrants
the
union
jack
had
waved
not
over
them
but
over
the
british
troops
sent
to
stamp
the
rising
out
this
was
more
than
mahony
could
stomach
flashing
up
from
his
seat
he
strove
to
assert
himself
above
the
hum
of
agreement
that
mounted
from
the
foreign
contingent
and
the
doubtful
sort
of
grumble
by
which
the
britisher
signifies
his
disapproval
chairman
gentlemen
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
i
call
upon
those
loyal
subjects
of
her
majesty
who
are
present
here
to
join
with
me
in
giving
three
cheers
for
the
british
flag
hip
hip
hurrah
and
again
hip
hip
hurrah
and
once
more
hip
hip
hurrah
his
compatriots
followed
him
though
flabbily
and
he
continued
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
shouts
of
order
and
the
bimming
of
the
chairman
bell
chairman
i
appeal
to
you
are
we
britons
to
sit
still
and
hear
our
country
flag
reviled
that
flag
which
has
ensured
us
the
very
liberty
we
are
enjoying
this
evening
the
gentleman
who
has
been
pleased
to
slander
it
is
not
i
believe
a
british
citizen
now
i
put
it
to
him
is
there
another
country
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
would
allow
people
of
all
nations
to
flock
into
a
colony
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
with
its
own
subjects
to
flock
in
take
all
they
can
get
and
then
make
off
with
it
a
point
of
view
that
elicited
forcible
grunts
of
assent
which
held
their
own
against
hoots
and
hisses
unfortunately
the
speaker
did
not
stop
here
but
went
on
gentlemen
do
not
i
implore
you
allow
yourselves
to
be
led
astray
by
a
handful
of
ungrateful
foreigners
who
have
received
nothing
but
benefits
from
our
crown
what
you
need
gentlemen
is
not
revolution
but
reform
not
strife
and
bloodshed
but
a
liberty
consistent
with
law
and
order
and
this
gentlemen
you
never
get
like
that
dick
muttered
purdy
not
so
much
gentlemening
if
you
please
said
a
man
who
might
have
been
a
vandemonian
in
his
day
men
what
we
are
that
good
enough
for
us
mahony
was
nettled
the
foreigners
too
were
pressing
him
am
i
then
to
believe
sir
what
i
frequently
hear
asserted
that
there
are
no
gentlemen
left
on
the
diggings
oh
lor
dick
said
purdy
he
was
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
clutching
his
cheeks
as
though
he
had
the
toothache
oh
stow
yer
blatherskite
believe
what
yer
bloody
well
like
retorted
the
vandemonian
fiercely
but
do
come
and
interrupt
our
pleasant
and
meetings
with
your
blamed
jaw
mahony
lost
his
temper
i
not
interrupt
when
i
see
you
great
hulks
of
men
oh
lor
groaned
purdy
again
who
call
yourselves
british
subjects
letting
yourselves
be
led
by
the
nose
like
the
sheep
you
are
by
a
pack
of
foreigners
who
are
basely
accepting
this
country
here
let
me
said
purdy
and
pushing
his
way
along
the
bench
he
hobbled
to
the
platform
where
several
arms
hoisted
him
up
there
he
stood
fronting
the
violent
commotion
that
had
ensued
on
his
friend
last
words
stood
bedraggled
bandaged
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
mahony
still
on
his
feet
angrily
erect
thought
he
understood
why
the
boy
had
refused
to
wash
himself
clean
or
to
change
his
dress
he
had
no
doubt
foreseen
the
possibility
of
some
such
dramatic
appearance
purdy
waited
for
the
hubbub
to
die
down
as
if
by
chance
he
had
rested
his
hand
on
the
bell
its
provoking
tinkle
ceased
now
he
broke
into
one
of
the
frank
and
hearty
smiles
that
never
fail
to
conciliate
brother
diggers
the
strongly
spoken
words
induced
an
abrupt
lull
the
audience
turned
to
him
still
thorny
and
sulky
it
was
true
but
yet
they
turned
and
one
among
them
demanded
a
hearing
for
the
youngster
brother
diggers
we
are
met
here
with
a
single
purpose
in
view
brother
diggers
we
are
not
met
here
to
throw
mud
at
our
dear
old
country
flag
nor
will
we
have
a
word
said
against
her
most
gracious
majesty
the
queen
not
us
we
men
first
whose
business
it
is
to
stand
up
for
a
gallant
little
woman
and
diggers
with
a
grievance
afterwards
are
you
with
me
boys
very
well
now
we
come
here
to
confab
about
getting
votes
or
having
a
hand
in
public
affairs
much
as
we
want
both
and
mean
to
have
when
the
time
comes
no
there
only
one
thing
that
matters
to
us
and
that
the
repeal
of
the
accursed
tax
here
such
a
tempest
of
applause
broke
out
that
he
was
unable
to
proceed
yes
i
say
it
again
he
went
on
when
they
would
let
him
speak
the
instant
repeal
when
that
been
done
this
curse
taken
off
us
then
it
be
time
enough
to
about
the
colour
of
the
flag
we
mean
to
have
and
about
going
shares
in
the
government
but
let
me
make
one
thing
clear
to
you
we
neither
traitors
to
the
crown

you
leave

this

over
at

stands

will

here
mahony
gave
a
loud
click
of
the
tongue
in
the
general
howl
of
execration
it
passed
unheard
and
pushing
his
way
out
of
the
tent
let
the
fall
to
behind
him
chapter
iii
he
retraced
his
steps
by
the
of
a
full
moon
which
showed
up
the
gaping
black
mouths
of
circular
shafts
and
silvered
the
water
that
flooded
abandoned
oblong
holes
to
their
brim
tents
and
huts
stood
white
and
forsaken
in
the
moonlight
their
owners
were
either
gathered
on
bakery
hill
or
had
repaired
to
one
of
the
gambling
and
dancing
saloons
that
lined
the
main
street
arrived
at
the
store
he
set
his
frantic
dog
free
and
putting
a
match
to
his
pipe
began
to
stroll
up
and
down
he
felt
annoyed
with
himself
for
having
helped
to
swell
the
crowd
of
malcontents
and
still
more
for
his
foolishness
in
giving
the
rein
to
a
momentary
irritation
as
if
it
mattered
a
doit
what
trash
these
foreigners
talked
no
thinking
person
took
their
bombast
seriously
the
authorities
with
great
good
sense
let
it
pass
for
what
it
was
a
noisy
of
steam
at
heart
the
diggers
were
as
sound
as
good
pippins
a
graver
consideration
was
purdy
growing
fellowship
with
the
rebel
faction
the
boy
was
too
young
and
still
too
much
of
a
to
have
a
black
mark
set
against
his
name
it
would
be
the
more
absurd
considering
that
his
sincerity
in
espousing
the
diggers
cause
was
far
from
proved
he
was
of
a
nature
to
ride
tantivy
into
anything
that
promised
excitement
or
adventure
with
it
must
regretfully
be
admitted
an
increasing
relish
for
the
limelight
for
theatrical
effect
see
the
cunning
with
which
he
had
made
capital
out
of
a
bandaged
ankle
and
dirty
dress
at
this
rate
and
with
his
engaging
ways
he
would
soon
stand
for
a
little
god
to
the
rough
artless
crowd
no
he
must
leave
the
diggings
and
mahony
rolled
various
schemes
in
his
mind
he
had
it
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
or
two
business
would
make
a
journey
to
melbourne
imperative
well
he
would
damn
the
extra
expense
and
take
the
boy
along
with
him
purdy
was
at
a
loose
end
and
would
no
doubt
rise
like
a
fish
to
a
fly
at
the
chance
of
getting
to
town
free
of
cost
after
all
why
be
hard
on
him
he
was
not
much
over
twenty
and
at
that
age
it
was
natural
enough
especially
in
a
place
like
this
for
a
lad
to
flit
like
a
butterfly
from
every
cup
that
took
his
restless
fancy
restless
h
it
was
the
word
purdy
had
flung
back
at
him
earlier
in
the
evening
at
the
time
he
had
rebutted
the
charge
with
a
glance
at
fifteen
months
spent
behind
the
counter
of
a
store
but
there
was
a
modicum
of
truth
in
it
none
the
less
the
life
one
led
out
here
was
not
calculated
to
tone
down
any
innate
restlessness
of
temperament
on
the
contrary
it
directly
hindered
one
from
becoming
fixed
and
settled
it
was
on
a
par
with
the
houses
you
lived
in
these
flimsy
tents
and
cabins
you
put
up
with
for
the
time
being
was
just
as
much
of
a
makeshift
affair
as
they
its
keynote
was
change
fortunes
were
made
and
lost
and
made
again
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
whole
townships
shot
up
to
be
deserted
the
moment
the
soil
ceased
to
yield
the
people
you
knew
were
here
and
gone
sold
up
burnt
out
or
dead
and
buried
and
so
whether
you
would
or
not
your
whole
outlook
became
attuned
to
the
general
unrest
you
lived
in
a
constant
anticipation
of
what
was
coming
next
well
he
could
own
to
the
weakness
with
more
justification
than
most
if
trade
continued
to
prosper
with
him
as
it
did
at
present
it
would
be
no
time
before
he
could
sell
out
and
joyfully
depart
for
the
old
country
in
the
meantime
why
complain
he
had
much
to
be
thankful
for
to
take
only
a
small
point
was
this
not
saturday
night
the
store
was
closed
and
a
string
of
congenial
occupations
offered
from
chopping
the
week
wood
a
clean
and
wholesome
task
which
he
gladly
performed
through
the
pages
of
an
engrossing
book
to
a
botanical
ramble
round
old
buninyong
the
thought
of
it
cheered
him
he
stooped
to
caress
his
two
cats
which
had
come
out
to
bear
him
the
mute
and
pleasant
company
of
their
kind
what
a
night
the
great
round
silver
moon
floated
serenely
through
space
dimming
the
stars
as
it
made
them
and
bathing
the
earth
in
splendour
it
was
so
light
that
straight
black
lines
of
smoke
could
be
seen
mounting
from
chimneys
and
fires
the
which
supplied
the
fuel
for
these
fires
spread
a
pleasant
balsamic
odour
and
the
live
red
patches
contrasted
oddly
with
the
pale
ardour
of
the
moon
lights
twinkled
over
all
the
township
but
were
brightest
in
main
street
the
course
of
which
they
followed
like
a
rope
of
fireflies
and
at
the
government
camp
on
the
steep
western
slope
where
no
doubt
as
young
purdy
had
impudently
averred
the
officials
still
sat
over
the
it
was
very
quiet
no
or
in
this
neighbourhood
thank
goodness
and
the
hour
was
still
too
early
for
drunken
roisterers
to
come
reeling
home
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
that
of
a
man
voice
singing
oft
in
the
stilly
night
to
the
yetching
accompaniment
of
a
concertina
mahony
hummed
the
tune
but
it
was
growing
cold
as
the
nights
were
apt
to
do
on
this
tableland
once
summer
was
past
he
whistled
his
dog
and
pompey
hurried
out
with
a
guilty
air
from
the
back
of
the
house
where
the
old
shaft
stood
that
served
to
hold
refuse
mahony
put
him
on
the
chain
and
was
just
about
to
turn
in
when
two
figures
rounded
the
corner
of
a
tent
and
came
towards
him
pushing
their
shadows
before
them
on
the
ground
evenin
doc
said
the
shorter
of
the
two
a
nuggetty
little
man
who
carried
his
arms
curved
out
from
his
sides
oh

evening

mahony
recognising

plug

said
mahony
and
rising
knocked
out
his
pipe
on
the
log
did
his
old
neighbour
once
get
launched
on
the
subject
of
his
failings
there
was
no
stopping
him

and
he
clapped
on
his
hat
drawing
a
sheaf
of
papers
from
an
inner
pocket
he
selected
one
and
offered
it
to
mahony
mahony
led
the
way
indoors
and
lighting
a
stooped
to
decipher
the
letter
for
some
weeks
now
he
had
been
awaiting
the
delivery
of
a
load
of
goods
the
invoice
for
which
had
long
since
reached
him
from
this
communication
carried
by
hand
he
learnt
that
the
drayman
having
got
bogged
just
beyond
bacchus
marsh
had
decamped
to
the
ovens
taking
with
him
all
he
could
cram
into
a
and
disposing
of
the
remainder
for
what
he
could
get
the
agent
in
melbourne
refused
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
loss
and
threatened
to
prosecute
if
payment
for
the
goods
were
not
immediately
forthcoming
mahony
who
here
heard
the
first
of
the
affair
was
highly
indignant
at
the
tone
of
the
letter
and
before
he
had
read
to
the
end
resolved
to
let
everything
else
slide
and
to
leave
for
melbourne
early
next
morning
ocock
backed
him
up
in
this
decision
and
with
the
aid
of
a
great
quill
pen
stiffly
traced
the
address
of
his
eldest
son
who
practised
as
a
solicitor
in
the
capital
go
you
straight
to
doc
see
you
through
brushing
aside
his
dreams
of
a
peaceful
sabbath
mahony
made
preparations
for
his
journey
waking
his
assistant
he
gave
the
man
a
stupid
clodhopper
but
honest
and
attached
instructions
how
to
manage
during
his
absence
then
sent
him
to
the
township
to
order
horses
himself
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
to
look
for
purdy
his
search
led
him
through
all
the
drunken
revelry
of
a
saturday
night
and
it
was
close
on
twelve
before
having
followed
the
trace
from
to
chinese
from
the
adelphi
to
mother
flannigan
and
haunts
still
less
reputable
he
finally
succeeded
in
catching
his
bird
chapter
iv
the
two
young
men
took
to
the
road
betimes
it
still
wanted
some
minutes
to
six
on
the
new
clock
in
the
tower
of
bath
hotel
when
they
threw
their
legs
over
their
saddles
and
rode
down
the
steep
slope
by
the
camp
reserve
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
pounded
the
plank
bridge
that
spanned
the
yarrowee
and
striking
loose
stones
and
smacking
and
sucking
in
the
mud
made
a
rude
clatter
in
the
sunday
quiet
having
followed
for
a
few
hundred
yards
the
wide
thoroughfare
of
main
street
the
riders
branched
off
to
cross
rising
ground
they
proceeded
in
single
file
and
at
a
footpace
for
the
highway
had
been
honeycombed
and
rendered
unsafe
it
also
ascended
steadily
just
before
they
entered
the
bush
which
was
alive
with
the
rich
strong
whistling
of
magpies
purdy
halted
to
look
back
and
wave
his
hat
in
farewell
mahony
also
in
the
saddle
there
it
lay
the
scattered
yet
congested
unlovely
wood
and
canvas
settlement
that
was
ballarat
at
this
distance
and
from
this
height
it
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
collection
of
child
bricks
tossed
out
at
random
over
the
ground
the
low
square
huts
and
cabins
that
composed
it
being
all
of
a
shape
and
size
some
threads
of
smoke
began
to
mount
towards
the
immense
pale
dome
of
the
sky
the
sun
was
catching
here
the
panes
of
a
window
there
the
tin
that
encased
a
primitive
chimney
they
rode
on
leaving
the
warmth
of
the
early
for
the
cold
blue
shadows
of
the
bush
neither
broke
the
silence
mahony
day
had
not
come
to
an
end
with
the
finding
of
purdy
barely
stretched
on
his
palliasse
he
had
been
routed
out
to
attend
to
long
jim
who
had
missed
his
footing
and
pitched
into
a
shaft
the
poor
old
tipsy
idiot
hauled
up
luckily
for
him
it
was
a
dry
shallow
hole
there
was
a
broken
to
set
mahony
had
installed
him
in
his
own
bed
and
had
spent
the
remainder
of
the
night
dozing
in
a
chair
so
now
he
was
uncommunicative
as
they
climbed
the
shoulder
and
came
to
the
rich
black
soil
that
surrounded
the
ancient
cone
of
warrenheip
he
mused
on
his
personal
relation
to
the
place
he
had
just
left
and
not
for
the
first
time
he
asked
himself
what
am
i
doing
here
when
he
was
absent
from
ballarat
and
could
dispassionately
consider
the
life
he
led
there
he
was
so
struck
by
the
incongruity
of
the
thing
that
like
the
beldame
in
the
he
could
have
pinched
himself
to
see
whether
he
waked
or
slept
had
anyone
told
him
three
years
previously
that
the
day
was
coming
when
he
would
weigh
out
soap
and
sugar
and
hand
them
over
a
counter
in
exchange
for
money
he
would
have
held
the
prophet
ripe
for
bedlam
yet
here
he
was
a
tradesman
and
as
greedy
of
gain
as
any
extraordinary
aye
and
distressing
too
the
ease
with
which
the
human
organism
adapted
itself
it
was
just
a
case
of
the
green
caterpillar
on
the
green
leaf
well
he
could
console
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
his
apparent
submission
was
only
an
affair
of
the
surface
he
had
struck
no
roots
and
it
would
mean
as
little
to
his
acquaintances
on
ballarat
when
he
silently
vanished
from
their
midst
as
it
would
to
him
if
he
never
saw
one
of
them
again
or
the
country
either
and
he
let
his
eye
roam
unlovingly
over
the
wild
landscape
with
its
skimpy
trees
meanwhile
they
were
advancing
their
nags
hoofs
beating
in
unison
devoured
mile
after
mile
of
the
road
it
was
a
typical
colonial
road
it
went
up
hill
and
down
dale
turned
aside
for
no
obstacles
at
one
time
it
ran
down
a
gully
that
was
almost
a
ravine
to
mount
straight
up
the
opposite
side
among
boulders
that
reached
to
the
at
others
it
led
through
a
reedy
swamp
or
a
stony
watercourse
or
it
became
a
bog
or
dived
through
a
creek
where
the
ground
was
flat
and
treeless
it
was
a
rutty
track
between
two
seas
of
pale
scant
grass
more
than
once
complaining
of
a
mouth
like
sawdust
purdy
alighted
and
limped
across
the
verandah
of
a
but
they
did
not
actually
draw
rein
till
towards
midday
they
reached
a
knot
of
weatherboard
verandahed
stores
smithies
and
arranged
at
the
four
corners
of
two
here
they
made
a
substantial
luncheon
and
the
odour
of
fried
onions
carried
far
and
wide
mahony
paid
his
three
shillings
for
a
bottle
of
ale
but
purdy
washed
down
the
steak
with
cup
after
cup
of
richly
sugared
tea
in
the
early
afternoon
they
set
off
again
revived
and
refreshed
purdy
caught
at
a
bunch
of
aromatic
leaves
and
burst
into
a
song
and
mahony
good
god
with
a
cloudless
sky
overhead
a
decent
bit
of
horseflesh
between
his
knees
and
the
prospect
of
a
three
days
holiday
from
storekeeping
his
name
would
not
have
been
what
it
was
if
he
had
for
long
remained
captious
downhearted
insufficient
sleep
and
an
empty
stomach
nothing
on
earth
besides
a
fig
for
his
black
thoughts
the
fact
of
his
being
obliged
to
spend
a
few
years
in
the
colony
would
in
the
end
profit
him
by
widening
his
experience
of
the
world
and
his
it
was
possible
to
lead
a
sober
godfearing
life
no
matter
in
what
rude
corner
of
the
globe
you
were
and
in
this
mood
he
was
even
willing
to
grant
the
landscape
a
certain
charm
since
leaving
ballan
the
road
had
dipped
up
and
down
a
succession
of
swelling
rises
and
untimbered
from
the
top
of
these
ridges
the
view
was
a
far
one
you
looked
straight
across
undulating
waves
of
country
and
intervening
to
where
on
the
horizon
a
long
low
sprawling
range
of
hills
lay
blue
and
painted
in
with
a
sure
brush
against
the
of
the
sky
what
did
the
tints
of
the
foliage
matter
when
wherever
you
turned
you
could
count
on
getting
these
marvellous
soft
distances
on
always
finding
a
range
of
hills
lovely
and
intangible
as
a
dream
there
was
not
much
traffic
to
the
diggings
on
a
sunday
and
having
come
to
a
level
bit
of
ground
the
riders
followed
a
joint
impulse
and
broke
into
a
canter
as
they
began
to
climb
again
they
fell
naturally
into
one
of
those
familiar
talks
full
of
allusion
and
reminiscence
that
are
only
possible
between
two
of
a
sex
who
have
lived
through
part
of
their
green
days
together
it
began
by
purdy
referring
to
the
satisfactory
fashion
in
which
he
had
disposed
of
his
tools
his
and
other
effects
he
was
not
travelling
to
melbourne
mahony
rallied
him
you
were
always
a
good
one
at
striking
a
bargain
my
boy
what
about
mivvies
for
an
alley
eh
dickybird
this
related
to
their
earliest
meeting
and
was
a
standing
joke
between
them
mahony
could
recall
the
incident
as
clearly
as
though
it
had
happened
yesterday
how
the
sturdy
little
english
boy
with
the
comical
english
accent
had
suddenly
bobbed
up
at
his
side
on
the
way
home
from
school
and
in
that
laughable
of
his
without
modulation
or
emphasis
had
offered
to
swop
him
as
above
purdy
laughed
and
paid
him
back
in
kind
yes
and
the
funk
you
were
in
for
fear
spiny
tatlow
see
us
and
peach
to
the
rest
yes
what
young
idiots
boys
are
in
thought
he
added
and
what
snobs
for
the
breach
of
convention
he
was
an
boy
at
the
time
had
not
been
his
sole
reason
for
wishing
to
shake
off
his
junior
behind
him
mahony
when
he
reached
home
closed
the
door
of
one
of
the
largest
houses
in
the
most
exclusive
square
in
dublin
whereas
purdy
lived
in
a
small
common
house
in
a
side
street
visits
there
had
to
be
paid
surreptitiously
all
the
same
these
were
frequent
and
for
the
best
of
reasons
mahony
could
still
see
purdy
plump
english
mother
who
was
as
jolly
and
happy
as
her
boy
hugging
the
loaf
to
her
bosom
while
she
cut
round
after
round
of
bread
and
butter
and
jam
for
two
cormorant
throats
and
the
elder
boy
and
lank
all
wrist
and
ankle
had
invariably
been
the
hungrier
of
the
two
for
on
the
glossy
damask
of
the
big
house
often
not
enough
food
was
set
to
satisfy
the
growing
appetites
of
himself
and
his
dickybird
ca
you
see
us
with
our
backs
to
the
wall
in
that
little
yard
of
yours
trying
who
could
take
the
biggest
bite
or
going
round
the
outside
first
and
though
you
burst
by
the
bones
of
davy
jones
till
only
a
little
island
of
jam
was
left
purdy
laughed
heartily
at
these
and
other
incidents
fished
up
by
his
friend
from
the
well
of
the
years
but
he
did
not
take
part
in
the
sport
himself
he
had
not
mahony
gift
for
recalling
detail
to
him
past
was
past
he
only
became
alive
and
eager
when
the
talk
turned
as
it
soon
did
on
his
immediate
prospects
this
time
to
his
astonishment
mahony
had
had
no
trouble
in
persuading
purdy
to
quit
the
diggings
in
addition
here
was
the
boy
now
declaring
openly
that
what
he
needed
and
must
have
was
a
fixed
and
steadily
paying
job
with
this
decision
mahony
was
in
warm
agreement
and
promised
all
the
help
that
lay
in
his
power
but
purdy
was
not
done
he
hummed
and
hawed
and
fidgeted
he
took
off
his
hat
and
looked
inside
it
he
wiped
his
forehead
and
the
nape
of
his
neck
mahony
knew
the
symptoms
come
dickybird
spit
it
out
my
boy
yes
er
well
the
fact
is
dick
i
begin
to
think
it
time
i
settled
down
mahony
gave
a
whistle
whew
a
lady
in
the
case
that
the
chat
just
oblige
yours
truly
by
takin
a
squint
at
this
will
you
he
handed
his
friend
a
sheet
of
thinnest
blue
paper
with
a
large
purple
stamp
in
one
corner
and
a
red
seal
on
the
back
opening
it
mahony
discovered
three
crossed
pages
written
in
a
delicately
pointed
minute
italian
hand
he
read
the
letter
to
the
end
deliberately
and
with
a
growing
sense
of
relief
composition
expression
and
penmanship
all
met
with
his
approval
this
is
the
writing
of
a
person
of
some
refinement
my
son
well
er
yes
said
purdy
he
seemed
about
to
add
a
further
word
then
swallowed
it
and
went
on
though
somehow
or
other
different
to
herself
on
paper
but
she
the
best
of
girls
dick
not
one
o
your
ethereal
misses
something
of
till
there
is
and
she
always
on
for
a
lark
i
never
met
such
girls
for
larks
as
her
and
sister
the
very
last
time
i
was
there
they
took
and
hung
up
me
and
some
other
fellers
had
been
stoppin
up
a
bit
late
the
night
before
and
kickin
up
a
bit
of
a
shindy
and
what
did
those
girls
do
they
got
the
barman
to
come
into
my
room
while
i
was
asleep
and
hang
a
bucket
o
water
to
one
of
the
beams
over
the
bed
then
i
blamed
if
they
did
tie
a
string
from
it
to
my
big
toe
i
gives
a
kick
down
comes
the
bucket
and
half
drowns
gosh
how
those
girls
did
laugh
h
said
mahony
dubiously
while
purdy
in
his
turn
chewed
the
cud
of
a
pleasant
well
i
for
my
part
should
be
glad
to
see
you
married
and
settled
with
a
good
wife
always
beside
you
that
just
the
rub
said
purdy
and
vigorously
scratched
his
head
till
a
girl
as
a
sweetheart
and
all
that
but
when
i
come
to
think
of
puttin
my
head
in
the
noose
from
now
till
doomsday
why
then
somehow
i
ca
bring
myself
to
pop
the
question
there
going
to
be
no
trifling
with
the
girl
feelings
i
hope
sir
bosh
but
i
say
dick
i
wish
you
turn
your
peepers
on
and
tell
me
what
you
make
of
she
but
she
got
a
mother
by
job
dick
if
i
thought
tilly
ever
get
like
that
and
exactly
the
same
build
too
it
would
certainly
be
well
for
him
to
inspect
purdy
flame
thought
mahony
especially
since
the
anecdote
told
did
not
bear
out
the
good
impression
left
by
the
letter
went
far
indeed
to
efface
it
still
he
was
loath
to
extend
his
absence
by
spending
a
night
at
geelong
where
a
it
came
out
the
lady
lived
and
he
replied
evasively
that
it
must
depend
on
the
speed
with
which
he
could
put
through
his
business
in
melbourne
purdy
was
silent
for
a
time
then
with
a
at
his
companion
he
volunteered
i
say
dick
i
know
some
one
who
suit
you
the
deuce
you
do
said
mahony
and
burst
out
laughing
miss
sister
no
doubt
no
no
not
her
jinn
all
right
but
she
not
your
sort
but
they
got
a
girl
living
with
a
sort
o
poor
relation
or
something
and
she
a
horse
of
quite
another
i
say
old
man
serious
now
have
you
never
thought
o
gettin
spliced
again
mahony
laughed
at
his
companion
words
there
descended
to
him
once
more
from
some
shadowy
distance
some
pure
height
the
vision
of
the
which
haunts
every
man
youth
and
in
ludicrous
juxtaposition
he
saw
the
women
the
only
women
he
had
encountered
since
coming
to
the
colony
the
hardworking
careworn
wives
of
diggers
the
harridans
sluts
and
prostitutes
who
made
up
the
balance
he
declined
to
be
drawn
is
it
old
moll
flannigan
or
one
of
her
darlints
you
be
wishing
me
luck
to
ye
spalpeen
man
do
i
say
i
found
the
wife
for
you
purdy
was
not
jesting
and
did
not
join
in
the
fresh
salvo
of
laughter
with
which
mahony
greeted
his
words
oh
blow
it
dick
you
too
fastidious
too
damned
particular
say
what
you
like
there
good
in
all
of
even
in
old
mother
flannigan
and
when
she
got
a
drop
inside
fuddle
old
moll
a
bit
and
she
give
you
the
very
shift
off
her
do
i
thank
the
lord
that
all
i
not
built
like
you
why
the
woman
is
born
i
ca
get
on
with
all
fish
that
comes
to
my
oh
to
be
young
dick
and
to
love
the
girls
to
see
their
little
waists
and
their
shoulders
and
the
dimples
in
their
cheeks
see
put
up
their
hands
to
their
bonnets
and
how
their
little
feet
peep
out
when
the
wind
blows
their
petticoats
against
their
legs
and
purdy
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
stretched
himself
in
an
excess
of
wellbeing
you
young
reprobate
bah
you
you
got
water
in
your
veins
nothing
of
the
sort
set
me
among
decent
women
and
there
no
company
i
enjoy
more
declared
mahony
dick
it
my
belief
you
were
born
old
mahony
was
still
young
enough
to
be
nettled
by
doubts
cast
on
his
vitality
purdy
laughed
in
his
sleeve
aloud
he
said
well
look
here
old
man
i
lay
you
a
wager
i
bet
you
you
not
game
when
you
see
that
tulip
i
been
tellin
you
about
to
take
her
in
your
arms
and
kiss
her
a
fiver
on
it
done
cried
mahony
and
i
have
it
in
one
note
if
you
please
bravo
cried
purdy
bravo
dick
and
having
gained
his
end
and
being
on
a
good
piece
of
road
between
fences
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
cantered
off
singing
as
he
went
she
wheels
a
wheelbarrow
through
streets
wide
and
narrow
crying
cockles
and
mussels
alive
but
the
sun
was
growing
large
in
the
western
sky
on
the
ground
to
the
left
their
failing
shadows
slanted
out
lengthwise
those
cast
by
the
horses
bodies
were
mounted
on
high
the
two
men
ceased
their
trifling
and
nudged
by
the
fall
of
day
began
to
ride
at
a
more
pace
pushing
forward
through
the
deep
basin
of
marsh
and
on
for
miles
over
wide
treeless
plains
to
where
the
road
was
joined
by
the
main
highway
from
the
north
coming
down
from
mount
alexander
and
the
bendigo
another
hour
and
from
a
gentle
eminence
the
buildings
of
melbourne
were
visible
the
mastheads
of
the
many
vessels
riding
at
anchor
in
hobson
bay
here
too
the
briny
scent
of
the
sea
carrying
up
over
grassy
flats
met
their
nostrils
and
set
mahony
hungrily
sniffing
the
brief
twilight
came
and
went
and
it
was
already
night
when
they
urged
their
weary
beasts
over
the
moonee
ponds
a
winding
chain
of
brackish
waterholes
the
horses
shambled
along
the
broad
hilly
tracks
of
north
melbourne
warily
picked
their
steps
through
the
city
itself
dingy
set
here
and
there
at
the
corners
of
roads
so
broad
that
you
could
hardly
see
across
them
shed
but
a
meagre
light
and
the
further
the
riders
advanced
the
more
difficult
became
their
passage
the
streets
in
process
of
laying
were
heaped
with
stones
and
intersected
by
trenches
finally
dismounting
they
thrust
their
arms
through
their
bridles
and
laboriously
covered
the
last
of
the
journey
on
foot
having
lodged
the
horses
at
a
they
repaired
to
a
hotel
in
little
collins
street
here
purdy
knew
the
proprietor
and
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
secure
a
small
room
for
the
use
of
themselves

built
on
two
hills
and
the
valley
that
lies
between
it
was
over
a
year
since
mahony
or
purdy
had
been
last
in
the
capital
and
next
morning
on
stepping
out
of
the
adam
and
eve
they
walked
up
the
eastern
slope
to
look
about
them
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
their
view
stretched
to
the
waters
of
the
bay
and
its
forest
of
masts
the
nearer
foreground
was
made
up
of
mud
flats
through
which
a
sluggish
river
wound
its
way
to
the
sea
on
the
horizon
to
the
north
the
dandenong
ranges
rose
and
distinct
and
seemed
momently
to
be
drawing
nearer
for
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
which
promised
rain
the
friends
caught
their
glimpses
of
the
landscape
between
dense
clouds
of
white
dust
which
blotted
everything
out
for
minutes
at
a
time
and
filled
eyes
nose
ears
with
a
gritty
powder
tiring
of
this
they
turned
and
descended
great
collins
street
a
spacious
thoroughfare
that
dipped
into
the
hollow
and
rose
again
and
was
so
long
that
on
its
western
height
pedestrians
looked
no
bigger
than
ants
in
the
heart
of
the
city
men
were
everywhere
at
work
laying
gas
and
macadamising
paving
kerbing
no
longer
would
the
old
wives
tale
be
credited
of
the
infant
drowned
in
the

of
swanston
street
or
of
the
bullock
which
sank
inch
by

before
its

in

of

up

tiny
dilapidated
weatherboards
in
the
roadway
handsome
chaises
landaus
made
room
for
eight
and
ten
strong
for
tumbrils
carrying
water
or
refuse
or
worse
for
droves
of
cattle
mobs
of
wild
colts
bound
for
auction
flocks
of

on
their
way
to
be

rubbed

with

in

and

plaid
trousers
who
adroitly
skipped

of

and

or
crept
along
the
narrow
edging
of
kerb
the
visitors
from
paused
to
listen
to
a
brass
band
that
played
outside
a
mart
to
watch
the
shooting
in
a
the
many
decently
attired
females
they
met
also
called
for
notice
not
a
year
ago
and
no
reputable
woman
walked
abroad
oftener
than
she
could
help
now
even
at
this
hour
the
streets
were
starred
with
them
purdy
his
eyes
turned
his
head
this
way
and
that
pointed
and
exclaimed
but
then
he
had
slept
like
a
log
and
felt
in
his
own
words
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
whereas
mahony
had
sat
his
horse
the
whole
night
through
had
never
ceased
to
balance
himself
in
an
imaginary
saddle
and
when
at
daybreak
he
had
fallen
into
a
deeper
sleep
he
was
either
reviewing
outrageous
females
on
purdy
behalf
or
accepting
wagers
to
kiss
them
hence
diverting
as
were
the
sights
of
the
city
he
did
not
come
to
them
with
the
naive
receptivity
of
purdy
it
was
besides
hard
to
detach
his
thoughts
from
the
disagreeable
affair
that
had
brought
him
to
melbourne
and
as
soon
as
banks
and
offices
began
to
take
down
their
shutters
he
hurried
off
to
his
interview
with
the
the
latter
place
of
business
was
behind
great
collins
street
in
a
lane
reached
by
a
turnpike
found
with
some
trouble
it
proved
to
be
a
rude
shanty
wedged
in
between
a
chinese
laundry
and
a
chinese
the
entrance
was
through
a
yard
in
which
stood
a
collection
of
while
further
back
gaped
a
dirty
closet
at
the
sound
of
their
steps
the
man
they
sought
emerged
and
mahony
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
a
little
over
a
twelvemonth
ago
he
had
first
had
dealings
with
him
this
bolliver
had
been
an
alert
and
respectable
man
of
business
now
he
was
evidently
on
the
downgrade
and
the
cause
of
the
deterioration
was
advertised
in
his
bloodshot
eyeballs
and
veinous
cheeks
early
as
was
the
hour
he
had
already
been
indulging
his
breath
puffed
sour
mahony
prepared
to
state
the
object
of
his
visit
in
no
uncertain
terms
but
his
preliminaries
were
cut
short
by
a
volley
of
abuse
the
man
accused
him
of
having
been
privy
to
the
rascally
drayman
fraud
and
of
having
hoped
by
lying
low
to
evade
his
liability
mahony
lost
his
temper
and
vowed
that
he
would
have
bolliver
up
for
defamation
of
character
to
which
the
latter
retorted
that
the
first
innings
in
a
court
of
law
would
be
his
he
had
already
put
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
his
attorney
this
was
the
last
straw
purdy
had
to
intervene
and
get
mahony
away
they
left
the
agent
shaking
his
fist
after
them
and
cursing
the
bloody
day
on
which
he
ever
been
fool
enough
to
do
a
deal
with
a
bloody
gentleman
at
the
corner
of
the
street
the
friends
paused
for
a
hasty
conference
mahony
was
for
marching
off
to
take
the
best
legal
advice
the
city
had
to
offer
but
purdy
disapproved
why
put
himself
to
so
much
trouble
when
he
had
old
ocock
recommendation
to
his
in
his
coat
pocket
what
in
the
name
of
was
the
sense
of
making
an
enemy
for
life
of
the
old
man
his
neighbour
and
a
good
customer
to
boot
these
counsels
prevailed
and
they
turned
their
steps
towards
chancery
lane
where
was
to
be
found
every
variety
of
legal
practitioner
from
barrister
to
scrivener
having
matched
the
and
descried
the
words
henry
ocock
conveyancer
and
attorney
commissioner
of
affidavits
painted
black
on
two
dusty
windows
they
climbed
a
wooden
stair
festooned
with
cobwebs
to
a
landing
where
an
injunction
to
push
and
enter
was
rudely
inked
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
affixed
to
a
door
obeying
they
passed
into
a
dingy
little
room
the
entire
furnishing
of
which
consisted
of
a
couple
of
deal
tables
with
a
chair
to
each
these
were
occupied
by
a
young
man
and
a
boy
neither
of
whom
rose
at
their
entrance
the
lad
was
cutting
notches
in
a
stick
and
whistling
tunefully
the
clerk
a
young
fellow
in
the
early
twenties
who
had
a
mop
of
flaming
red
hair
and
eyes
looked
at
the
strangers
but
without
lifting
his
head
his
eyes
performed
the
necessary
motion
mahony
desired
to
know
if
he
had
the
pleasure
of
addressing
henry
ocock
in
reply
the
gave
a
noiseless
laugh
which
he
immediately
quenched
by
clapping
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
shutting
one
eye
at
his
junior
said
no
nor
yet
the
shar
o
persia
nor
alphybetical
foster
what
can
i
do
for
you
governor
you
can
have
the
goodness
to
inform
ocock
that
i
wish
to
see
him
flashed
back
mahony
singin
now
then
mike
me
child
toddle
with
patent
reluctance
the
boy
ceased
his
whittling
and
dawdled
across
the
room
to
an
inner
door
through
which
he
vanished
having
first
let
his
knuckles
bump
as
if
by
chance
against
the
wood
of
the
panel
a
second
later
he
reappeared
boss
engaged
but
mahony
surprised
a
lightning
sign
between
the
pair
no
sir
i
decline
to
state
my
business
to
anyone
but
ocock
himself
he
declared
hotly
in
response
to
the
invitation
to
get
it
off
his
chest
if
you
choose
to
find
out
when
he
will
be
at
liberty
i
will
wait
so
long
no
longer
as
the
had
somehow
failed
to
hit
his
seat
on
his
passage
to
the
outer
door
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
clerk
to
do
but
himself
to
undertake
the
errand
he
lounged
up
from
his
chair
and
in
his
case
without
even
the
semblance
of
a
knock
squeezed
through
a
foot
wide
aperture
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
two
strangers
should
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
was
going
on
inside
but
his
voice
came
to
them
through
the
thin
partition
oh
just
a
couple
o
paddylanders
mahony
who
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
dart
an
angry
glance
at
purdy
which
should
say
this
is
what
one
gets
by
coming
to
your
pettifoggers
now
let
his
eyes
rest
on
his
friend
and
critically
detailed
the
latter
appearance
the
description
fitted
to
a
nicety
purdy
did
in
truth
look
down
on
his
luck
unkempt
bearded
to
the
eyes
there
he
stood
clutching
his
shapeless
old
in
jumper
and
threadbare
smalls
the
very
spit
of
the
unsuccessful
digger
well
might
they
be
suspected
of
not
owning
the
necessary
to
pay
their
way
all
serene
mister
the
take
you
on
the
sanctum
was
a
trifle
larger
than
the
outer
room
but
almost
equally
bare
were
piled
up
in
one
corner
stalking
in
with
his
chin
in
the
air
mahony
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
of
his
own
age
who
sat
absorbed
in
the
study
of
a
document
at
their
entry
two
beady
grey
eyes
lifted
to
take
a
brief
but
thorough
survey
and
a
hand
with
a
pencil
in
it
pointed
to
the
single
empty
chair
mahony
declined
to
translate
the
gesture
and
remained
standing
under
the
best
of
circumstances
it
irked
him
to
be
kept
waiting
here
following
on
the
clerk
saucy
familiarity
the
wilful
delay
made
his
gorge
rise
for
a
few
seconds
he
fumed
in
silence
then
his
patience
exhausted
he
burst
out
my
time
sir
is
as
precious
as
your
own
with
your
permission
i
will
take
my
business
elsewhere
at
these
words
and
at
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
the
head
shot
up
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
under
the
chin
again
he
narrowed
his
eyes
at
the
couple
and
this
time
he
laid
the
document
from
him
and
asked
suavely
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
change
in
his
manner
though
slight
was
unmistakable
mahony
had
a
nice
ear
for
such
refinements
and
responded
to
the
shade
of
difference
with
the
promptness
of
one
who
had
been
on
the
watch
for
it
his
irritation
fell
he
was
ready
on
the
instant
to
be
propitiated
putting
his
hat
aside
he
sat
down
and
having
introduced
himself
made
reference
to
ballarat
and
his
acquaintance
with
the
lawyer
father
who
directed
me
to
you
sir
for
advice
on
a
vexatious
affair
in
which
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
become
involved
with
a
pray
be
seated
ocock
rose
and
cleared
a
chair
for
purdy
resuming
his
seat
he
joined
his
hands
and
wound
them
in
and
out
i
think
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
no
case
is
so
unpromising
but
what
we
shall
be
able
to
find
a
loophole
mahony
thanked
him
with
a
touch
of
reserve
i
trust
you
will
still
be
of
that
opinion
when
you
have
heard
the
facts
and
went
on
myself
i
do
not
doubt
it
i
am
not
a
rich
man
but
serious
though
the
monetary
loss
would
be
to
me
i
should
settle
the
matter
out
of
court
were
i
not
positive
that
i
had
right
on
my
side
to
which
ocock
returned
a
quick
oh
quite
so
of
course
like
his
old
father
he
was
a
short
heavily
built
man
but
there
the
likeness
ended
he
had
a
high
domed
forehead
above
a
thin
hooked
nose
his
skin
was
of
an
almost
jewish
pallor
fringes
of
straight
hair
grew
down
the
walls
of
his
cheeks
and
round
his
chin
meeting
beneath
it
the
shaven
upper
lid
was
long
and
flat
with
no
central
markings
and
helped
to
form
a
mouth
that
had
not
much
more
shape
or
expression
than
a
slit
cut
by
a
knife
in
a
sheet
of
paper
the
chin
was
bare
to
the
size
of
a
and
both
while
he
spoke
and
while
he
listened
to
others
speaking
the
lawyer
caressed
this
patch
with
his
so
that
in
the
course
of
time
it
had
arrived
at
a
state
of
high
polish
like
the
shell
of
an
egg
the
air
with
which
he
heard
his
new
client
out
was
of
a
kind
and
mahony
having
talked
his
first
heat
off
grew
chilled
by
the
wet
blanket
of
ocock
silence
there
was
nothing
in
this
of
the
frank
responsiveness
with
which
your
ordinary
mortal
lends
his
ear
the
brain
behind
the
dome
was
one
might
be
sure
adding
combining
comparing
and
drawing
its
own
conclusions
why
should
lawyers
he
wondered
treat
those
who
came
to
them
like
children
advancing
only
in
so
far
as
it
suited
them
out
of
the
darkness
where
they
housed
among
strangely
worded
paragraphs
and
obscure
formulas
but
these
musings
were
cut
short
having
fondled
his
chin
for
a
further
moment
ocock
looked
up
and
put
a
question
and
while
he
could
not
but
admire
the
acumen
this
did
not
lessen
mahony
discomfort
all
unguided
it
went
straight
for
what
he
believed
to
be
the
one
weak
spot
in
his
armour
it
related
to
the
drayman
contrary
to
custom
mahony
had
on
this
occasion
himself
recommended
the
driver
and
as
he
admitted
it
his
ears
rang
again
with
the
plaints
of
his
stranded
a
wheedler
from
the
south
country
off
whose
tongue
the
familiar
brogue
had
dripped
like
honey
his
recommendation
he
explained
had
been
made
out
of
charity
he
had
not
forced
the
agent
to
engage
the
man
and
it
would
surely
be
a
gross
injustice
if
he
alone
were
to
be
held
responsible
to
his
relief
ocock
did
not
seem
to
attach
importance
to
the
fact
but
went
on
to
ask
whether
any
written
agreement
had
existed
between
the
parties
no
writing
h
so
so
to
read
his
thoughts
was
an
impossibility
but
as
he
proceeded
with
his
catechism
it
was
easy
to
see
how
his
interest
in
the
case
grew
he
began
to
treat
it
tenderly
warmed
to
it
as
an
artist
to
his
work
and
mahony
spirits
rose
in
consequence
having
selected
a
number
of
minor
points
that
would
tell
in
their
favour
ocock
dilated
upon
the
libellous
aspersion
that
had
been
cast
on
mahony
good
faith
my
experience
has
invariably
been
this
mahony
people
who
suggest
that
kind
of
thing
and
accuse
others
of
it
are
those
who
are
accustomed
to
make
use
of
such
means
themselves
in
this
case
there
may
have
been
no
goods
at
all
the
thing
may
prove
to
have
been
a
job
from
beginning
to
end
but
his
hearer
start
of
surprise
was
too
marked
to
be
overlooked
well
let
us
take
the
existence
of
the
goods
for
granted
but
might
they
not
being
partly
of
a
perishable
nature
have
gone
bad
or
otherwise
got
spoiled
on
the
road
and
not
have
been
in
a
fit
condition
for
you
to
receive
at
your
end
this
was
credible
mahony
nodded
his
assent
he
also
added
gratuitously
that
he
had
before
now
been
obliged
to
reclaim
on
casks
of
mouldy
at
which
ocock
ceased
coddling
his
chin
to
point
a
straight
forefinger
at
him
with
a
triumphant
you
see
but
purdy
who
sick
and
tired
of
the
discussion
had
withdrawn
to
the
window
to
watch
the
rain
in
runlets
down
the
dusty
panes
and
hiss
and
spatter
on
the
sill
purdy
puckered
his
lips
to
a
sly
and
soundless
whistle
the
interview
at
an
end
ocock
mentioned
in
his
frigidly
urbane
way
that
he
had
recently
been
informed
there
was
an
excellent
opening
for
a
firm
of
solicitors
in
ballarat
could
mahony
as
a
resident
confirm
the
report
mahony
regretted
his
ignorance
but
spoke
in
praise
of
the
golden
city
and
its
assured
this
would
be
most
welcome
news
to
your
father
sir
i
can
picture
his
satisfaction
on
hearing
it
golly
dick
that
no
mopoke
was
purdy
comment
as
they
emerged
into
the
street
a
crafty
devil
if
ever
i
see
one
henry
ocock
seems
to
me
to
be
a
singularly
able
man
replied
mahony
drily
to
his
thinking
purdy
had
cut
a
poor
figure
during
the
visit
he
had
said
no
intelligent
word
but
had
lounged
lumpishly
in
his
chair
the
very
picture
of
the
country
man
come
up
to
the
metropolis
and
growing
tired
of
this
had
gone
like
a
restless
child
to
thrum
his
fingers
on
the
panes
oh
you
bet
he
slither
you
through
what
do
you
insinuate
there
any
need
for
slithering
as
you
call
it
cried
mahony
why
dick
old
man
and
as
long
as
he
gets
you
through
what
does
it
matter
it
matters
to
me
sir
the
rain
a
tropical
deluge
was
over
by
the
time
they
reached
the
hollow
the
sun
shone
again
hot
and
sticky
and
people
were
venturing
forth
from
their
shelters
to
wade
through
beds
of
mud
or
to
cross
on
planks
the
deep
swift
rivers
formed
by
the
open
drains
there
were
several
such
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
each
time
the
refuse
of
the
city
was
whirled
past
on
the
flood
to
be
left
as
an
edging
to
the
footpaths
when
the
water
went
down
mahony
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
getting
together
a
fresh
load
of
goods
for
whether
he
lost
or
won
his
suit
the
store
had
to
be
restocked
without
delay
that
evening
towards
eight
the
two
men
turned
out
of
the
lowther
arcade
the
night
was
cold
dark
and
wet
and
they
had
wound
comforters
round
their
bare
throats
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
mechanics
hall
to
hear
a
lecture
on
mesmerism
mahony
had
looked
forward
to
this
all
through
the
sorry
job
of
choosing
soaps
and
candles
the
subject
piqued
his
curiosity
it
was
the
one
drop
of
mental
stimulant
he
could
hope
to
extract
from
his
visit
the
theatre
was
out
of
the
question
if
none
of
the
actors
happened
to
be
drunk
a
fair
proportion
of
the
audience
was
sure
to
be
part
of
his
pleasure
this
evening
was
due
to
purdy
having
agreed
to
accompany
him
it
was
always
a
matter
of
regret
to
mahony
that
outside
the
hobnob
of
daily
life
he
and
his
friend
had
so
few
interests
in
common
that
purdy
should
rest
content
with
the
coarse
diversions
of
the
ordinary
digger
then
from
the
black
shadows
of
the
arcade
a
woman
form
detached
itself
and
a
hand
was
laid
on
purdy
arm
shout
us
a
drink
old
pal
mahony
made
a
quick
repellent
movement
of
the
shoulder
but
purdy
some
vagrom
fancy
quickened
in
him
either
by
the
voice
which
was
not
unrefined
or
by
the
stealthiness
of
the
approach
purdy
turned
to
look
come
come
my
boy
we
no
time
to
lose
without
raising
her
pleasant
voice
the
woman
levelled
a
volley
of
abuse
at
mahony
then
muttered
a
word
in
purdy
ear
just
half
a
jiff
dick
said
purdy
or
go
i
make
up
on
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mahony
aired
his
heels
in
front
of
a
then
he
gave
it
up
and
went
on
his
way
but
his
pleasure
was
damped
the
inconsiderateness
with
which
purdy
could
shake
him
off
always
had
a
disconcerting
effect
on
him
to
face
the
matter
squarely
the
friendship
between
them
did
not
mean
as
much
to
purdy
as
to
him
the
sudden
impulse
that
had
made
the
boy
relinquish
a
promising
clerkship
to
emigrate
in
his
wake
into
this
he
had
read
more
than
it
would
and
as
he
picked
his
muddy
steps
mahony
agreed
with
himself
that
the
net
result
for
him
of
purdy
coming
to
the
colony
had
been
to
saddle
him
with
a
new
responsibility
it
was
his
lot
for
ever
to
be
helping
the
lad
out
of
tight
places
sometimes
it
made
him
feel
unnecessarily
bearish
for
purdy
had
the
knack
common
to
sunny
improvident
natures
of
taking
everything
that
was
done
for
him
for
granted
his
want
of
delicacy
in
this
respect
was
distressing
yet
in
spite
of
it
all
it
was
hard
to
bear
him
a
grudge
for
long
together
a
young
beggar
if
ever
there
was
one
that
very
day
how
faithfully
he
had
stuck
at
his
side
assisting
at
dull
discussions
and
duller
purchasings
without
once
obtruding
his
own
and
here
mahony
remembered
their
talk
on
the
ride
to
town
purdy
had
expressed
the
wish
to
settle
down
and
take
a
wife
a
poor
friend
that
would
be
who
did
not
back
him
up
in
this
intention
as
he
sidled
into
one
of
the
front
benches
of
a
hall
the
mesmerist
a
man
in
black
already
surveyed
its
thinness
from
the
platform
with
an
air
of
pained
surprise
mahony
decided
that
purdy
should
have
his
chance
the
heavy
rains
of
the
day
and
the
consequent
probable
flooding
of
the
ponds
and
the
marsh
would
serve
as
an
excuse
for
a
change
of
route
he
would
go
and
have
a
look
at
sweetheart
would
ride
back
to
the
diggings
by
way
of
geelong
chapter
vi
in
a
whitewashed
parlour
of
beamish
family
hotel
some
few
miles
north
of
geelong
three
young
women
in
voluminous
skirts
and
with
their
hair
looped
low
over
their
ears
sat
at
work
books
lay
open
on
the
table
before
two
of
them
the
third
was
making
a
bookmark
two
were
fair
plump
rosy
and
well
over
twenty
the
third
and
dark
was
still
a
very
young
girl
she
it
was
who
stitched
magenta
hieroglyphics
on
a
strip
of
perforated
cardboard
do
lem
me
see
poll
said
the
eldest
of
the
trio
and
laid
down
her
pen
you
bin
quick
about
it
my
dear
polly
the
brunette
freed
her
needle
of
silk
and
twirled
the
bookmark
by
its
ribbon
ends
spinning
the
mystic
characters
united
to
form
the
words
kiss
me
quick
her
companions
tittered
if
ma
did
know
for
certain
was
meant
for
your
brother
john
she
never
let
you
make
it
said
the
second
blonde
whose
name
was
jinny
girls
what
a
lark
it
be
to
send
it
up
to
purdy
smith
by
ned
said
the
first
speaker
polly
blushed
fy
tilly
that
would
be
ladylike
tilly
big
bosom
rose
and
fell
in
a
sigh
what
a
lark
never
is
jinny
giggled
agreeably
scandalized
what
things
you
do
say
till
do
let
ma
you
that
all
ma
be
blowed
does
this
look
now
polly
and
across
the
tilly
pushed
a
copybook
in
which
she
had
laboriously
inscribed
a
prim
maxim
the
requisite
number
of
times
polly
laid
down
her
work
and
knitted
her
brows
over
the
page
well
it
better
than
the
last
one
tilly
she
said
gently
averse
to
hurting
her
pupil
feelings
but
still
not
quite
good
enough
the
f
look
should
be
more
like
this
and
taking
a
steel
pen
she
made
several
f
in
a
tiny
pointed
hand
tilly
yielded
an
ungrudging
admiration
well
you
do
it
poll
but
i
hate
writing
if
only
ma
were
so
set
on
it
you

able
to
write
yourself
to
a
certain
person
name

wo

said
jinny
looking
sage
what
the
odds
we
always
got
poll
to
write
for
us
gave
back
tilly
and
lazily
stretched
out
a
large
plump
hand
to
recover
the
copybook
a
certain
person
never
know
or
not
till
it
too
late
here

said
jinny
and
held
out
a
book

now
again

put
down
her
embroidery
she
took
the
book
plough

she

echoed
jinny
vaguely
and
turned
a
pair
of
soft
brown
eyes
on
the
blowflies
sitting
sticky
and
sleepy
round
the
walls
of
the
room
wait
a
jiff

oh

prompted
polly
the
speller
coming
to
a
full
stop
shot
out
jinny
in
triumph
not
quite
right
said
polly
it
jinny
oh

what

jinny
in

again
jinny
dear
she
said
reluctantly
as
nothing
further
was
forthcoming
oh
no
poll
began
jinny
with
fresh
vigour
but
before
she
could
add
a
fourth
to
the
three
letters
a
heavy
foot
pounded
down
the
passage
and
a
stout
woman
out
of
breath
her
flying
came
bustling
in
and
slammed
the
door
girls
girls

sprung
up
from

seats
the
three
girls
darted
to
and
fro
the
telltale
spelling
and
were
flung
into
the
drawer
of
the
chiffonier
and
the
key
was
turned
on
them
polly
her
immodest
sampler
safely
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
her
workbox
was
the
most
composed
of
the
three
and
while
locks
were
smoothed
and
collars
adjusted
in
the
adjoining
bedroom
she
remained
behind
to
look
out
thimbles
needles
and
strips
of
plain
sewing
and
to
lay
them
naturally
about
the
table
the
blonde
sisters
reappeared
all
aglow
with
excitement
tilly
in
particular
was
in
a
sad
flutter
girls
i
simply
ca

she
declared

her

of
course
ma
give
the
come
on
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
imitated
by
her
sister
she
scrambled
over
the
window
sill
to
the
verandah
polly
found
herself
alone
her
conscientious
scrupling
but
mother
may
be
cross
had
passed
unheeded
now
she
too
fell
into
a
flurry
she
could
not
remain
there
by
herself
to
meet
two
young
men
one
of
whom
was
a
stranger
steps
and
voices
were
already
audible
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
so
since
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
she
clambered
after
her
friends
though
with
difficulty
for
she
was
not
very
tall
this
was
why
when
beamish
flourished
open
the
door
exclaiming
in
a
hearty
tone
an
you
find
gents
sittin
at
their
needles
busy
as
bees
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
the
room
was
a
very
neat
leg
clad
in
a
white
stocking
and
black
prunella
boot
which
was
just
being
drawn
up
over
the
sill
it
flashed
from
sight
and
the
patter
of
running
feet
beat
the
floor
of
the
verandah
ha
ha
too
late
the
birds
have
flown
laughed
purdy
and
smacked
his
thigh
well
i
declare
an
so
they
the
naughty
creatures
exclaimed
beamish
in
mock
dismay
but
trust
you
smith
for
sayin
the
right
thing
jus
exackly
like
birds
they
are
so
shy
an
but
i
give
you
the
gents
they
not
be
far
away
jus
you
show
two
can
play
at
that
mr
you
know
the
should
say
i
do
many
the
time
i
anchored
there
cried
purdy
with
a
guffaw
come
dick
and
crossing
to
the
window
he
straddled
over
the
frame
and
disappeared
reluctantly
mahony
followed
him
from
the
verandah
they
went
down
into
the
where
the
drab
and
tangled
growths
that
had
outlived
the
summer
were
beaten
flat
by
the
recent
rains
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
behind
a
clump
of
stood
an
arbour
formed
of
a
yellow
buddleia
no
trace
of
a
petticoat
was
visible
so
thick
was
the
leafage
but
a
loud
whispering
and
tittering
betrayed
the
fugitives
at
the
apparition
of
the
young
men
who
stooped
to
the
low
entrance
there
was
a
cascade
of
shrieks
oh
lor
you
frightened
me
did
you
know
we
were
you
wicked
fellow
get
away
will
you
i
the
very
sight
of
you
this
from
tilly
as
purdy
his
hands
on
her
hips
gave
her
a
smacking
kiss
the
other
girls
feared
a
like
greeting
there
were
more
squeaks
and
squeals
and
some
ineffectual
dives
for
the
doorway
purdy
spread
out
his
arms
hi
look
out
stop
dick
now
then
man
here
your
chance
mahony
stood
blinking
it
was
dusk
inside
after
the
dazzle
of
the
sun
at
this
reminder
of
the
foolish
bet
he
had
taken
he
hurriedly
seized
the
young
woman
who
was
next
him
and
embraced
her
it
chanced
to
be
jinny
she
screamed
and
made
a
feint
of
feeling
mortally
outraged
mahony
had
to
dodge
a
box
on
the
ears
but
purdy
burst
into
a
horselaugh
and
held
his
sides
without
knowing
why
tilly
joined
in
and
jinny
too
was
infected
when
purdy
could
speak
he
blurted
out
dick
you
fathead
you
jackass
you
mugged
the
wrong
one
at
this
clownish
mirth
mahony
felt
the
blood
boil
up
over
ears
and
temples
for
an
instant
he
stood
irresolute
did
he
admit
the
blunder
his
victim
would
be
hurt
did
he
deny
it
he
would
save
his
own
face
at
the
expense
of
the
other
young
woman
feelings
so
though
he
could
have
throttled
purdy
he
put
a
bold
front
on
the
matter
carpe
diem
is
my
motto
my
boy
i
intend
to
make
both
young
ladies
pay
toll
his
words
were
the
signal
for
a
fresh
scream
and
flutter
the
third
young
person
had
escaped
and
was
flying
down
the
path
this
called
for
chase
and
capture
she
was
not
very
agile
but
she
knew
the
ground
which
outside
the
garden
was
rocky
and
uneven
for
a
time
she
had
mahony
at
vantage
his
heart
was
not
in
the
game
in
cutting
undignified
capers
among
the
he
felt
as
foolish
as
a
performing
dog
then
however
she
caught
her
toe
in
her
dress
and
stumbled
he
could
not
disregard
the
opportunity
he
advanced
upon
her
but
two
beseeching
hands
fended
him
off
no
no
please
oh
please
do
this
was
no
catchpenny
coquetry
it
was
a
genuine
dread
of
undue
familiarity
a
kindred
trait
in
mahony
own
nature
rose
to
meet
it
certainly
not
if
it
is
disagreeable
to
you
shall
we
shake
hands
instead
two
of
the
blackest
eyes
he
had
ever
seen
were
raised
to
his
and
a
flushed
face
dimpled
they
shook
hands
and
he
offered
his
arm
halfway
to
the
arbour
they
met
the
others
coming
to
find
them
the
girls
bore
diminutive
parasols
and
purdy
in
rollicking
spirits
tilly
on
one
arm
jinny
on
the
other
held
polly
above
his
head
on
the
appearance
of
the
laggards
jinny
who
had
put
her
own
interpretation
on
the
misplaced
kiss
prepared
to
free
her
arm
but
purdy
winking
at
his
friend
squeezed
it
to
his
side
and
held
her
prisoner
tilly
buzzed
a
word
in
his
ear
yes
by
thunder
he
ejaculated
and
letting
go
of
his
companions
he
spun
round
like
a
ladies
let
me
introduce
to
you
my
friend
richard
edinburgh
at
present
proprietor
of
the
emporium
dead
dog
hill
ballarat
dick
my
hearty
miss
tilly
beamish
for
her
sauce
miss
jinny
renowned
for
her
skill
in
casting
the
eyes
of
sheep
and
last
but
not
least
pretty
little
polly
perkins
alias
miss
polly
turnham
whose
good
deeds
put
those
of
dorcas
to
the
blush
the
misses
beamish
went
into
fits
of
laughter
and
tilly
hit
purdy
over
the
back
with
her
parasol
but
the
string
of
letters
had
puzzled
them
roused
their
curiosity
earth
do
they
mean
gracious
so
clever
it
makes
me
feel
quite
queer
to
told
us
before
purd
so
we
could
studied
up
however
a
walk
to
a
cave
was
under
discussion
and
purdy
urged
them
on
phoebus
is
on
the
wane
girls
and
it
going
to
be
damn
cold
once
more
with
the
young
person
called
polly
as
companion
mahony
followed
after
he
walked
in
silence
listening
to
the
rattle
of
the
three
in
front
at
best
he
was
but
a
poor
hand
at
the
kind
of
repartee
demanded
of
their
swains
by
these
young
women
and
his
slender
talent
failed
him
altogether
crushed
by
the
general
tone
of
vulgar
levity
looking
over
at
the
horizon
which
swam
in
a
kind
of
haze
below
the
sinking
sun
he
smiled
thinly
to
himself
at
ideas
of
wiving
reminded
he
was
not
alone
by
feeling
the
hand
on
his
arm
tremble
he
glanced
down
at
his
companion
and
his
eye
was
arrested
by
a
neatly
parted
head
of
the
glossiest
black
imaginable
he
pulled
himself
together
your
cousins
are
excellent
walkers
oh
yes
very
but
they
are
not
my
cousins
mahony
pricked
up
his
ears
but
you
live
here
yes
i
help
moth
beamish
in
the
house
but
as
if
with
this
she
had
said
too
much
she
grew
again
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
made
of
her
taking
pity
on
her
timidity
mahony
tried
to
put
her
at
ease
by
talking
about
himself
he
described
his
life
on
the
diggings
and
the
straits
to
which
he
was
at
times
reduced
the
buttons
affixed
to
his
clothing
by
means
of
wire
his
periodic
onslaughts
on
the
celebrated
pudding
it
had
taken
him
over
four
hours
to
make
and
polly
listening
to
him
forgot
her
desire
to
run
away
instead
she
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
tales
of
his
masculine
shiftlessness
but
as
soon
as
they
came
in
view
of
the
others
tilly
and
purdy
sitting
under
one
parasol
on
a
rock
by
the
cave
jinny
standing
and
looking
out
rather
aggressively
after
the
loiterers
she
withdrew
her
arm
moth
beamish
will
need
me
to
help
her
with
tea
and
and
would
you
please
walk
back
with
jinny
before
he
could
reply
she
had
turned
and
was
hurrying
away
they
got
home
from
the
cave
at
sundown
he
with
the
ripe
jinny
hanging
a
dead
weight
on
his
arm
to
find
tea
spread
in
the
private
parlour
the
table
was
all
but
invisible
under
its
load
and
their
hostess
looked
as
though
she
had
been
parboiled
on
her
own
kitchen
fire
she
sat
and
fanned
herself
with
a
sheet
of
newspaper
while
time
and
again
undaunted
by
refusals
she
pressed
the
good
things
upon
her
guests
there
were
juicy
beefsteaks
piled
high
with
rings
of
onion
and
a
barracoota
and
a
cold
leg
of
mutton
there
were
and
a
dish
of
and
a
jug
of
custard
butter
and
bread
were
fresh
and
new
scones
and
cakes
had
just
left
the
oven
and
the
great
cups
of
tea
were
tempered
by
pure
thick
cream
to
the
two
men
who
came
from
diggers
fare
cold
chop
for
breakfast
cold
chop
for
dinner
and
cold
chop
for
tea
the
meal
was
little
short
of
a
banquet
and
few
words
were
spoken
in
its
course
but
the
moment
arrived
when
they
could
eat
no
more
and
when
even
beamish
ceased
to
urge
them
pipes
and
pouches
were
produced
polly
and
jinny
rose
to
collect
the
plates
tilly
and
her
beau
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
verandah
they
could
be
seen
in
silhouette
against
the
rising
moon
tilly
head
drooping
to
purdy
shoulder
beamish
looked
from
them
to
mahony
with
a
knowing
smile
and
whispered
behind
her
hand
i
do
wish
those
two
up
an
make
up
their
minds
that
i
do
i
like
to
see

either

another
or

i
seen

our
polly
mahony
she
made
mahony
wince
by
stressing
the
second
syllable
of
his
name
bless
you
no
no
relation
whatsoever
she
just
a
bit
in
the
an
is
company
for
the
girls
we
tuck
in
a
year
ago
own
relations
played
a
dirty
trick
must
let
catch
me
sayin
so
though
she
wo
a
word
against
and
that
as
it
should
be
looking
round
and
finding
polly
absent
from
the
room
she
went
on
to
tell
mahony
how
polly
eldest
brother
a
ten
years
resident
in
melbourne
had
sent
to
england
for
the
girl
on
her
leaving
school
to
come
out
and
assist
in
keeping
his
house
and
how
an
elder
sister
who
was
governessing
in
sydney
had
chosen
just
this
moment
to
throw
up
her
post
and
return
to
quarter
herself
upon
the
brother
an
so
when
polly
gets
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
in
short
frocks
in
charge
of
the
there
was
no
room
for
an
she
to
look
about
for
somethin
else
to
do
we
tuck
in
an
i
will
say
i
never
regretted
it
indeed
i
do
know
now
we
ever
got
on
without
yes
it
you
i
talkin
about
miss
singin
yer
praises
an
you
need
get
as
red
as
if
you
bin
up
to
mischief
pa
say
as
much
for
you
too
that
i
will
said
beamish
opening
his
mouth
for
the
first
time
except
to
put
food
in
it
that
i
will
and
he
patted
polly
hand
the
man
as
gits
polly
git
a
treasure
polly
blushed
after
the
helpless
touching
fashion
of
very
young
creatures
the
blood
stained
her
cheeks
mounted
to
her
forehead
spread
in
a
warm
wave
over
neck
and
ears
to
spare
her
mahony
turned
his
head
and
looked
out
of
the
window
he
would
have
liked
to
say
run
away
child
run
away
and
do
let
them
see
your
confusion
polly
however
went
conscientiously
about
her
task
and
only
left
the
room
when
she
had
picked
up
her
full
complement
of
but
she
did
not
appear
again
that
night
deserted
even
by
beamish
the
two
men
pushed
back
their
chairs
from
the
table
and
drew
tranquilly
at
their
pipes
the
innkeeper
proved
an
odd
misty
sort
of
fellow
exceedingly
backward
at
declaring
himself
it
was
as
though
each
of
his
heavy
words
had
to
be
fetched
from
a
distance
no
doubt
about
it
it
the
wife
that
wears
the
breeches
was
mahony
inward
comment
and
as
one
after
another
of
his
remarks
fell
flat
become
almost
a
it
would
seem
under
the
eternal
female
clacking
but
for
each
mortal
there
exists
at
least
one
theme
to
fire
him
in
the
case
of
beamish
this
turned
out
to
be
the
land
question
before
the
gold
discovery
he
had
been
a
bush
shepherd
he
told
mahony
and
if
he
had
called
the
tune
he
would
have
lived
and
died
one
but
the
wife
had
had
ambitions
the
children
were
growing
up
and
every
one
knew
what
it
was
when
women
got
a
maggot
in
their
heads
there
had
been
no
peace
for
him
till
he
had
chucked
his
job
and
joined
the
rush
to
mount
alexander
but
at
heart
he
had
remained
a
bushman
and
he
was
now
all
on
the
side
of
the
squatters
in
their
tussle
with
the
crown
he
knew
a
bit
he
make
bold
to
say
about
the
acreage
needed
in
certain
districts
per
head
of
sheep
he
could
tell
a
tale
of
the
risks
and
mischances
squatting
involved
if
fire
it
flood
an
if
the
water
passes
you
by
it
the
scab
or
the
rot
to
his
thinking
the
government
attempt
to
restrict
the
areas
of
and
to
give
effect
to
the
which
limited
the
tenure
were
acts
of
folly
the
gold
supply
would
give
out
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
but
sheep
would
graze
there
till
the
crack
of
doom
the
land
was
fit
for
nothing
else
mahony
thought
this
point
of
view
lopsided
no
new
country
could
hope
to
develop
and
prosper
without
a
steady
influx
of
the
right
kind
of
population
and
this
the
colony
would
never
have
so
long
as
the
authorities
by
refusing
to
sell
them
land
made
it
impossible
for
immigrants
to
settle
there
why
america
was
but
three
thousand
miles
distant
from
the
old
country
compared
with
australia
thirteen
thousand
and
in
america
land
was
to
be
had
in
plenty
at
five
shillings
per
acre
as
to
beamish
idea
of
the
gold
giving
out
the
geological
formation
of
the
goldfields
rendered
that
improbable
he
sympathised
with
the
squatters
who
naturally
enough
believed
their
rights
to
the
land
inalienable
but
a
government
worthy
of
the
name
must
legislate
with
an
eye
to
the
future
not
for
the
present
alone
their
talk
was
broken
by
long
gaps
in
these
the
resonant
voice
of
beamish
could
be
heard
rebuking
and
directing
her
two
handmaidens
now
then
jinny
look
alive
an
do
ack
like
a
dyin
duck
in
a
thunderstorm
or
you
never
get
back
to
do
your
bit
o
spoonin
save
them
bones
polly
never
waste
an
atom
my
chuck
remember
that
when
you
got
an
of
your
own
no
girls
i
always
says
through
their
stomachs
that
the
shortcut
to
their
the
rest
on
the
verandah
in
face
of
the
vasty
night
tilly
head
had
found
its
and
an
arm
lay
round
her
waist
i
shall
make
cut
off
beard
first
thing
said
jinny
that
night
she
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
a
big
bed
which
the
three
girls
shared
with
one
another
um
just
you
wait
and
see
if
it
as
easy
as
you
think
retorted
tilly
from
her
pillow
again
purdy
had
let
slip
a
golden
chance
to
put
the
decisive
question
and
tilly
temper
was
short
in
consequence
mahony
though
i
do
wonder
ever
keeps
people
from
saying
said
jinny
dreamily
she
too
had
spent
some
time
in
and
believed
she
had
ground
for
hope
just
listen
to
will
you
said
tilly
angrily
upon
my
word
jinny
beamish
if
one
did
know
you
the
of
marrying
yourself
off
to
every
fresh
cove
you
meet
one
say
you
was
downright
bold
you
need
talk
every
one
can
see
you
as
mad
as
can
be
because
you
ca
bring
your
old
to
the
scratch
oh
hush
jinny
said
polly
grieved
at
this
thrust
into
tilly
open
wound
well
it
oh
look
now
there
not
a
drop
o
water
in
this
blessed
jug
again
week
is
it
to
fill
it
tilly
yours
serves
you
right
you
can
fetch
it
yourself
think
i
see
myself
polly
intervened
i
go
for
it
jinny
what
a
little
duck
you
are
poll
but
you
sha
go
alone
i
carry
the
candle
tying
on
a
petticoat
over
her
bedgown
polly
took
the
ewer
and
with
jinny
as
set
forth
there
was
still
some
noise
in
the
public
part
of
the
house
beside
the
bar
but
the
passage
was
bare
and
quiet
the
girls
crept
mousily
past
the
room
occupied
by
the
two
young
men
and
after
several
false
alarms
and
suppressed
chirps
reached
the
back
door
and
filled
the
jug
at
the
tap
of
the
tank
the
return
journey
was
not
so
successful
just
as
they
got
level
with
the
visitors
room
they
heard
feet
crossing
the
floor
polly
started
the
water
splashed
over
the
neck
of
the
jug
and
fell
with
a
loud
plop
at
this
jinny
lost
her
head
and
ran
off
with
the
candle
polly
in
a
panic
of
fright
dived
into
the
pantry
with
her
burden
and
crouched
down
behind
a
tub
of
fermenting
and
sure
enough
a
minute
after
the
door
of
the
room
opposite
was
flung
open
and
a
pair
of
jackboots
landed
in
the
passage
nor
was
this
the
worst
the
door
was
not
shut
again
but
remained
ajar
through
the
chink
polly
shrunk
to
her
smallest
what
if
one
of
them
should
feel
hungry
and
come
into
the
pantry
and
discover
her
polly
heard
purdy
say
with
appalling
loudness
oh
go
on
old
jaw
so
he
then
seemed
to
plunge
his
head
in
the
basin
for
it
was
with
a
choke
and
a
splutter
that
he
next
inquired
and
what
did
you
think
of
the
little
was
i
right
there
was
the
chink
of
coins
handled
and
the
other
voice
answered
here
what
i
think
take
your
money
my
boy
and
be
done
with
it
dick
great
snakes
why
damn
it
all
man
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
and
understand
sir
in
future
that
i
do
not
make
bets
where
a
lady
is
concerned
oh
i
know
only
on
the
and
yet
good
lord
dick
the
rest
was
drowned
in
a
bawl
of
laughter
under
cover
of
it
polly
took
to
her
heels
and
fled
regardless
of
the
open
door
or
the
padding
of
her
bare
feet
on
the
boards
without
replying
to
the
astonished
jinny
query
in
respect
of
the
water
she
climbed
over
tilly
to
her
place
beside
the
wall
and
shutting
her
eyes
very
tight
drew
the
sheet
over
her
face
it
felt
as
though
it
would
never
be
cool
hence
jinny
agreeably
wakeful
was
forced
to
keep
her
thoughts
to
herself
for
if
you
lie
between
two
people
one
of
whom
is
in
a
bad
temper
and
the
other
fast
asleep
you
might
just
as
well
be
alone
in
bed
next
morning
polly
alleged
a
headache
and
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
only
jinny
and
tilly
stood
on
the
verandah
of
romantic
memories
and
ruefully
waved
their
handkerchiefs
keeping
it
up
till
even
the
forms
of
horses
were
blurred
in
the
distance
chapter
vii
his
had
never
seemed
so
comfortless
he
ended
his
solitary
ride
late
at
night
and
wet
to
the
skin
his
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
far
from
any
smithy
long
jim
alone
came
to
the
door
to
greet
him
the
shopman
on
whose
doltish
honesty
mahony
would
have
staked
his
head
had
profited
by
his
absence
to
empty
the
and
go
off
on
the
even
one
of
the
cats
had
met
its
fate
in
an
old
shaft
where
its
corpse
still
swam
the
following
day
as
a
result
of
exposure
and
hard
riding
mahony
was
attacked
by
dysentery
and
before
he
had
recovered
the
goods
arrived
from
melbourne
they
had
to
be
unloaded
at
some
distance
from
the
store
conveyed
there
got
under
cover
checked
off
and
arranged
this
was
carried
out
in
sheets
of
cold
rain
which
soaked
the
canvas
walls
and
made
it
doubly
hard
to
get
about
the
clay
tracks
that
served
as
streets
as
if
this
were
not
enough
the
river
in
front
of
the
house
rose
rose
and
in
two
twos
was
over
its
banks
and
he
and
long
jim
spent
a
night
in
their
clothes
helping
neighbours
less
fortunately
placed
to
move
their
belongings
into
safety
the
lion
share
of
this
work
fell
on
him
long
jim
still
carried
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
was
good
for
nothing
but
to
guard
the
store
and
summon
mahony
on
the
appearance
of
customers
since
his
accident
too
the
fellow
had
suffered
from
frequent
fits
of
colic
or
cramp
and
was
for
ever
slipping
off
to
the
township
to
find
the
spirits
in
which
his
employer
refused
to
deal
for
the
unloading
and
warehousing
of
the
goods
it
was
true
old
ocock
had
loaned
his
sons
but
the
strict
watch
mahony
felt
bound
to
keep
over
this
pretty
pair
far
outweighed
what
their
help
was
worth
to
him
now
it
was
sunday
evening
and
for
the
first
time
for
more
than
a
week
he
could
call
his
soul
his
own
again
he
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
those
of
his
neighbours
who
were
not
roman
catholics
making
for
church
and
chapel
to
which
half
a
dozen
tinkly
bells
invited
them
the
weather
had
finally
cleared
up
and
a
goodly
number
of
people
waded
past
him
through
the
mire
among
them
in
seemly
sabbath
dress
went
ocock
with
his
two
black
sheep
at
heel
the
old
man
was
a
rigid
methodist
and
at
a
recent
had
been
moved
to
bear
public
witness
to
his
salvation
this
was
no
doubt
one
reason
why
the
young
scapegrace
tom
almost
simultaneous
misconduct
had
been
so
bitter
a
pill
for
him
to
swallow
while
through
god
mercy
he
was
become
an
exemplar
to
the
weaker
brethren
a
son
of
his
made
his
name
to
stink
in
the
nostrils
of
the
reputable
community
mahony
liked
to
believe
that
there
was
good
in
everybody
and
thought
the
intolerant
harshness
which
the
boy
was
subjected
would
defeat
its
end
yet
it
was
open
to
question
if
clemency
would
have
answered
better
bad
eggs
the
brace
of
them
had
been
his
own
verdict
after
a
week
trial
of
the
lads
one
would
not
the
other
apparently
could
not
work
johnny
the
elder
was
dull
and
liverish
from
intemperance
and
the
adolescent
the
news
of
whose
fatherhood
had
raced
the
wind
was
so
so
craven
in
the
presence
of
his
elders
that
he
could
not
say
bo
to
a
battledore
there
was
something
unnatural
about
this
fierce
timidity
and
the
doctor
in
mahony
caught
a
quick
glimpse
of
the
probable
reverse
of
the
picture
but
it
was
cold
in
face
of
all
this
clay
cold
clouds
drove
across
a
sky
and
he
still
felt
unwell
returning
to
his
where
a
small
american
stove
was
burning
he
prepared
for
a
quiet
evening
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
stood
an
old
he
lifted
the
lid
and
thrust
his
hand
in
it
was
here
he
kept
his
books
he
needed
no
light
to
see
by
he
knew
each
volume
by
the
feel
and
after
fumbling
for
a
little
among
the
tumbled
contents
he
drew
forth
a
work
on
natural
science
and
sat
down
to
read
but
he
did
not
get
far
his
brain
was
tired
intractable
lighting
his
pipe
he
tilted
back
his
chair
laid
the
vestiges
face
downwards
and
put
his
feet
on
the
table
how
differently
bashfulness
impressed
one
in
the
case
of
the
weaker
sex
there
it
was
altogether
pleasing
young
ocock
gaucherie
had
recalled
the
little
maid
polly
ingenuous
confusion
at
finding
herself
the
subject
of
conversation
he
had
not
once
consciously
thought
of
polly
since
his
return
now
when
he
did
so
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
she
had
made
herself
quite
a
warm
little
nest
in
his
memory
looked
back
on
she
stood
out
in
high
relief
against
her
somewhat
graceless
surroundings
small
doubt
she
was
both
maidenly
and
refined
he
also
remembered
with
a
sensible
pleasure
her
brisk
service
her
consideration
for
others
what
a
boon
it
would
have
been
during
the
past
week
to
have
a
busy
willing
little
woman
at
work
with
him
and
for
him
behind
the
screen
as
it
was
for
want
of
a
helping
hand
the
place
was
like
a
pigsty
he
had
had
neither
time
nor
energy
to
clean
up
the
marks
of
hobnailed
boots
patterned
the
floor
loose
mud
and
crumbs
from
meals
had
been
swept
into
corners
or
under
the
while
commodities
that
had
overflowed
the
shop
added
to
the
disorder
good
lord
no
no
place
this
for
a
woman
he
rose
and
moved
restlessly
about
turning
things
over
with
his
foot
these
old
papers
should
be
burnt
and
that
heap
of
those
empty
sardine
and
be
thrown
into
the
scrubbed
and
clean
it
was
by
no
means
an
uncomfortable
room
and
the
stove
drew
well
he
was
proud
of
his
stove
many
houses
had
not
even
a
chimney
he
stood
and
stared
at
it
but
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
he
found
himself
trying
to
call
to
mind
polly
face
except
for
a
pair
of
big
black
eyes
magnificent
eyes
they
seemed
to
him
in
retrospect
he
had
carried
away
with
him
nothing
of
her
outward
appearance
yes
stay
her
hair
her
hair
was
so
glossy
that
when
the
sun
caught
it
high
lights
came
out
on
it
so
much
he
remembered
from
this
he
fell
to
wondering
whether
her
brain
kept
pace
with
her
nimble
hands
and
ways
was
she
stupid
or
clever
he
could
not
tolerate
stupidity
and
polly
had
given
him
no
chance
to
judge
her
had
hardly
opened
her
lips
before
him
what
a
timid
little
thing
she
was
to
be
sure
he
should
have
made
it
his
business
to
draw
her
out
by
being
kind
and
encouraging
instead
of
which
he
had
acted
towards
her
he
felt
convinced
like
an
boor
he
did
not
know
how
it
was
but
he
could
detach
his
thoughts
from
polly
this
evening
to
their
accompaniment
he
paced
up
and
down
all
of
a
sudden
he
stood
still
and
gave
a
short
hearty
laugh
he
had
just
seen
in
a
kind
of
phantom
picture
the
feet
of
the
sisters
beamish
as
they
sat
on
the
verandah
edge
both
young
women
wore
flat
and
so
that
neatest
of
neat
ankles
had
been
little
polly
property
for
his
life
he
loved
a
ankle
in
a
woman
a
minute
later
he
sat
down
at
the
table
again
an
idea
had
occurred
to
him
he
would
write
polly
a
letter
a
letter
that
called
for
acknowledgment
and
form
an
opinion
of
the
girl
from
her
reply
taking
a
sheet
of
thin
blue
paper
and
a
magnum
bonum
pen
he
wrote
dear
miss
turnham
i
wonder
if
i
might
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favour
on
getting
back
to
ballarat
i
find
that
the
rain
has
spoilt
my
store
flag
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
make
me
a
new
one
i
have
no
lady
friends
here
to
apply
to
for
help
and
i
am
sure
you
are
clever
with
your
needle
if
you
consent
i
will
send
you
the
old
flag
as
a
pattern
and
stuff
for
the
new
one
my
kind
regards
to
all
at
the
hotel
faithfully
yours
richard
i
have
not
forgotten
our
pleasant
walk
to
the
cave
he
went
out
to
the
post
with
it
himself
in
one
hand
he
carried
the
letter
in
the
other
the
stuck
in
a
bottle
that
was
known
as
a
for
it
was
a
pitchdark
night
trade
was
slack
in
consequence
he
found
the
four
days
that
had
to
pass
before
he
could
hope
for
an
answer
exceptionally
long
after
their
lapse
he
twice
spent
an
hour
at
the
post
office
in
a
fruitless
attempt
to
get
near
the
little
window
on
returning
from
the
second
of
these
absences
he
found
the
letter
waiting
for
him
it
had
been
delivered
by
hand
so
far
good
polly
had
risen
to
his
fly
he
broke
the
seal
dear
sir
i
shall
be
happy
to
help
you
with
your
new
flag
if
i
am
able
will
you
kindly
send
the
old
one
and
the
stuff
down
by
my
brother
who
is
coming
to
see
me
on
saturday
he
is
working
at
rotten
gully
and
his
name
is
ned
i
do
not
know
if
i
sew
well
enough
to
please
you
but
i
will
do
my
best
i
remain
yours
truly
mary
turnham
mahony
read
smiled
and
laid
the
letter
down
only
to
pick
it
up
again
it
pleased
him
did
this
prim
little
note
there
was
just
the
right
shade
of
formal
reserve
about
it
then
he
began
to
study
particulars
grammar
and
spelling
were
correct
the
penmanship
was
in
the
italian
style
minute
yet
flowing
the
letters
dowered
with
generous
loops
and
tails
but
surely
he
had
seen
this
writing
before
by
jupiter
yes
this
was
the
hand
of
the
letter
purdy
had
shown
him
on
the
road
to
melbourne
the
little
puss
so
she
not
only
wrote
her
own
letters
but
those
of
her
friends
as
well
in
that
case
she
was
certainly
not
stupid
for
she
was
much
the
youngest
of
the
three
was
thursday
summoning
long
jim
from
his
seat
behind
the
counter
mahony
dispatched
him
to
rotten
gully
with
an
injunction
not
to
show
himself
till
he
had
found
a
digger
of
the
name
of
turnham
and
having
watched
jim
set
out
at
a
snail
pace
and
murmuring
to
himself
mahony
went
into
the
store
and
measured
and
cut
off
material
for
the
new
flag
from
two
different
coloured
rolls
of
stuff
it
was
ten
that
night
before
polly
brother
presented
himself
mahony
met
him
at
the
door
and
drew
him
in
the
stove
crackled
the
room
was
swept
and
garnished
he
flattered
himself
that
the
report
on
his
habitat
would
be
a
favourable
one
ned
appearance
gave
him
a
pleasant
shock
it
was
just
as
if
polly
herself
translated
into
male
terms
stood
before
him
no
need
now
to
cudgel
his
brains
for
her
image
in
looking
at
ned
he
looked
again
at
polly
the
off
the
same
fine
soft
black
hair
came
to
light
here
worn
rather
long
and
curly
the
same
glittering
black
eyes
skin
short
straight
nose
and
as
he
gazed
an
offshoot
of
mahony
consciousness
wondered
from
what
quarter
this
english
family
fetched
its
dark
strain
in
the
beginning
he
exerted
himself
to
set
the
lad
at
ease
he
soon
saw
however
that
he
might
spare
his
pains
though
clearly
not
much
more
than
eighteen
years
old
ned
turnharn
had
the
aplomb
and
assurance
of
double
that
age
lolling
back
in
the
single
armchair
the
room
boasted
he
more
than
once
stretched
out
his
hand
and
helped
himself
from
the
sherry
bottle
mahony
had
placed
on
the
table
and
the
disparity
in
their
ages
notwithstanding
there
was
no
trace
of
deference
in
his
manner
or
the
sole
hint
of
it
was
he
sometimes
smothered
a
profane
word
or
apologised
with
a
winning
smile
for
an
oath
that
had
slipped
out
unawares
mahony
could
not
accustom
him
self
to
the
foul
language
that
formed
the
diggers
idiom
here
in
the
case
of
polly
brother
he
sought
to
overlook
the
offence
or
to
lay
the
blame
for
it
on
other
shoulders
at
his
age
and
alone
the
boy
should
never
have
been
plunged
into
this
gehenna
ned
talked
mainly
of
himself
and
his
doings
but
other
facts
also
transpired
of
greater
interest
to
his
hearer
thus
mahony
learned
that
out
of
a
family
of
nine
four
had
found
their
way
to
the
colony
and
a
fifth
was
soon
to
follow
a
mere
child
this
on
the
under
side
of
fifteen
he
gathered
too
that
the
eldest
brother
john
by
name
was
regarded
as
a
kind
of
napoleon
by
the
younger
fry
at
thirty
this
john
was
a
partner
in
the
largest
wholesale
warehouse
in
melbourne
he
had
also
married
money
and
intended
in
due
course
to
stand
for
the
legislative
council
behind
ned
windy
bragging
mahony
thought
he
discerned
tokens
of
a
fond
brotherly
pride
if
this
were
so
the
affair
had
its
pathetic
side
for
from
what
the
boy
said
it
was
evident
that
the
successful
man
of
business
held
his
relatives
at
arm
length
and
as
ned
talked
on
mahony
conceived
john
to
himself
as
a
kind
of
which
once
it
had
drawn
these
lesser
creatures
after
it
switched
off
the
current
and
left
them
to
their
own
devices
ned
young
as
he
was
had
tried
his
hand
at
many
trades
at
present
he
was
working
as
a
hired
digger
but
this
only
till
he
could
strike
a
softer
job
digging
was
not
for
him
thank
you
what
you
earned
at
it
hardly
repaid
you
for
the
sweat
you
dripped
his
every
second
word
indeed
was
of
how
he
could
amass
most
money
with
the
minimum
of
bodily
exertion
this
calculating
unyouthful
outlook
was
repugnant
to
mahony
and
for
all
his
goodwill
the
longer
he
listened
to
ned
the
cooler
he
felt
himself
grow
another
disagreeable
impression
was
left
by
the
grudging
fashion
in
which
ned
accepted
an
impulsive
offer
on
his
part
to
take
him
into
the
store
it
was
made
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
mahony
had
qualms
about
it
while
his
words
were
still
warm
on
the
air
realizing
that
the
overture
was
aimed
not
at
ned
in
person
but
at
ned
as
polly
brother
but
his
intuition
did
not
reconcile
him
to
ned
he
would
have
preferred
a
straight
refusal
the
best
trait
he
could
discover
in
the
lad
was
his
affection
for
his
sister
this
seemed
genuine
he
was
going
to
see
her
again
getting
a
lift
halfway
tramping
the
other
twenty
odd
miles
at
the
end
of
the
week
perhaps
though
in
the
case
of
such
a
young
opportunist
the
thought
of
beamish
lavish
board
played
no
small
part
for
ned
had
a
rather
lean
underfed
look
but
this
only
occurred
to
mahony
afterwards
then
his
chief
vexation
was
with
himself
it
would
have
been
kinder
to
set
a
dish
of
solid
food
before
the
boy
in
place
of
the
naked
but
as
usual
his
hospitable
leanings
came
too
late
one
thing
more
as
he
lighted
ned
and
his
bundle
of
stuff
through
the
shop
he
was
impelled
to
slip
a
coin
into
the
boy
hand
with
a
murmured
apology
for
the
trouble
he
had
put
him
to
and
a
something
the
merest
nuance
in
ned
manner
of
receiving
and
pocketing
the
money
flashed
the
uncomfortable
suspicion
through
the
giver
mind
that
it
had
been
looked
for
expected
and
this
was
the
most
unpleasant
touch
of
all
but
bless
his
soul
did
not
most
large
families
include
at
least
one
poorish
specimen
he
had
got
thus
far
by
the
time
he
came
to
wind
up
his
watch
for
the
night
and
next
day
he
felt
sure
he
had
judged
ned
his
first
impressions
of
people
he
had
had
occasion
to
deplore
the
fact
before
now
were
apt
to
be
either
dead
white
or
black
as
ink
the
web
of
his
mind
took
on
no
half
tints
the
boy
had
not
betrayed
any
actual
vices
and
time
might
be
trusted
to
knock
the
bluster
out
of
him
with
this
reflection
mahony
dismissed
ned
from
his
mind
he
had
more
important
things
to
think
of
chief
among
which
was
his
own
state
with
regard
to
ned
sister
and
during
the
fortnight
that
followed
he
went
about
making
believe
to
weigh
this
matter
to
view
it
from
every
coign
for
it
did
not
suit
him
even
in
secret
to
confess
to
the
vehemence
with
which
when
he
much
desired
a
thing
his
temperament
knocked
flat
the
hurdles
of
reason
the
truth
was
his
mind
was
made
up
and
had
been
all
along
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
he
was
going
to
ask
polly
to
be
his
wife
doubts
beset
him
of
course
how
could
he
suppose
that
a
girl
who
knew
nothing
of
him
who
had
barely
seen
him
would
either
want
or
consent
to
marry
him
and
even
if
for
if
were
cheap
she
did
say
yes
would
it
be
fair
of
him
to
take
her
out
of
a
comfortable
home
away
from
friends
such
as
they
were
of
her
own
sex
to
land
her
in
these
crude
surroundings
where
he
did
not
know
a
decent
woman
to
bear
her
company
yet
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
him
too
he
was
very
lonely
now
that
purdy
had
gone
he
was
reduced
for
society
to
the
long
jims
and
ococks
of
the
place
what
would
he
not
give
once
more
to
have
a
refined
companion
at
his
side
certainly
marriage
might
postpone
the
day
on
which
he
hoped
to
shake
the
dust
of
australia
off
his
feet
life
a
deux
would
mean
a
larger
outlay
saving
not
prove
so
easy
still
it
could
be
done
and
he
would
gladly
submit
to
the
delay
if
by
doing
so
he
could
get
polly
besides
if
this
new
happiness
came
to
him
it
would
help
him
to
see
the
years
he
had
spent
in
the
colony
in
a
truer
and
juster
light
and
then
when
the
hour
of
departure
did
strike
what
a
joy
to
have
a
wife
to
carry
with
one
a
polly
to
rescue
to
restore
to
civilisation
he
had
to
remind
himself
more
than
once
during
this
fortnight
that
she
would
be
able
to
devote
only
a
fraction
of
her
day
to
flagmaking
but
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
by
the
time
a
parcel
and
a
letter
were
left
for
him
at
the
store
again
by
hand
little
polly
had
plainly
no
sixpences
to
spare
the
needlework
as
perfect
of
course
he
hardly
glanced
at
it
even
when
he
had
opened
and
read
the
letter
this
was
of
the
same
decorous
nature
as
the
first
polly
returned
a
piece
of
stuff
that
had
remained
over
he
had
really
sent
material
enough
for
two
flags
she
wrote
but
she
had
not
wished
to
keep
him
waiting
so
long
and
then
in
a
postscript
smith
was
here
last
sunday
i
am
to
say
beamish
would
be
very
pleased
if
you
also
would
call
again
to
see
us
he
ran
the
flag
up
to
the
top
of
his
staff
and
wrote
what
i
want
to
know
miss
polly
is
would
you
be
glad
to
see
me
but
polly
was
not
to
be
drawn
we
should
all
be
very
pleased
some
days
previously
mahony
had
addressed
a
question
to
henry
ocock
with
this
third
letter
from
polly
he
held
the
lawyer
answer
in
his
hand
it
was
unsatisfactory
yourself
ats
bolliver
we
think
that
action
will
be
set
down
for
trial
in
about
six
weeks
time
in
these
circumstances
we
do
not
think
any
useful
purpose
will
be
served
by
you
calling
to
see
us
until
this
is
done
we
should
be
glad
if
you
would
call
after
the
action
is
entered
six
weeks
time
the
man
might
as
well
have
said
a
year
and
meanwhile
purdy
was
stealing
a
march
on
him
was
paying
clandestine
visits
to
geelong
was
it
conceivable
that
anyone
in
his
five
senses
could
prefer
tilly
to
polly
it
was
not
in
the
clutch
of
a
sudden
fear
mahony
went
to
bath
and
ordered
a
horse
for
the
following
morning
this
time
he
left
his
store
in
charge
of
a
young
consumptive
whose
plight
had
touched
his
heart
the
poor
fellow
was
stranded
on
ballarat
without
a
farthing
having
proved
like
many
another
of
his
physique
quite
unfit
for
work
on
the
diggings
a
strict
baptist
this
hempel
and
one
who
believed
would
be
his
portion
if
he
so
much
as
guessed
at
the
plant
of
his
employer
he
also
pledged
his
word
to
bear
and
forbear
with
long
jim
the
latter
saw
himself
superseded
with
an
extreme
bad
grace
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
find
a
new
job
mahony
nag
was
in
good
condition
and
he
covered
the
distance
in
a
trifle
over
six
hours
he
had
evidently
hit
on
the
family
the
big
boiler
in
the
yard
belched
clouds
of
steam
the
female
inmates
of
the
hotel
were
gathered
in
the
he
saw
them
through
the
door
as
he
rode
in
at
the
gate
all
three
girls
stood
before
tubs
their
sleeves
rolled
up
their
arms
in
the
lather
at
his
apparition
there
was
a
characteristic
chorus
of
cheeps
and
shrills
and
the
door
was
banged
to
beamish
alone
came
out
to
greet
him
she
was
moist
and
blown
and
smelt
of
soap
not
in
a
mood
to
mince
matters
he
announced
straightway
the
object
of
his
visit
he
was
prepared
for
some
expression
of
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
good
woman
but
the
blend
of
amazement
and
uncivil
incredulity
to
which
she
subjected
him
made
him
hot
and
angry
and
he
vouchsafed
no
further
word
of
explanation
beamish
presently
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
finish
wiping
the
suds
from
her
fat
red
arms
thereafter
she
gave
way
to
a
very
feminine
weakness
well
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
blessed
if
i
did
suspeck
somethin
of
it
right
from
the
first
why
did
i
say
to
beamish
with
me
own
lips
you
could
take
your
eyes
off
well
well
i
sure
i
wish
you
every
though
we
goin
to
get
on
without
polly
i
reelly
do
know

i
wish
it
bin
one
o
my
two
as
tuck
your
fancy
that
all
between
you

i
do
believe
a
blessed
thing
goin
to
come
of
all
young
smith
danglin
round
an
polly
still
a
bit
young
only
just
turned
sixteen
not
as
she
any
the
worse
o
that
though
you
get
the
easier
into
your
ways
an
now
i
mus
look
smart
an
get
you
a
bite
o
somethin
after
your
ride
in
vain
did
mahony
assure
her
that
he
had
lunched
on
the
road
he
did
not
know
beamish
he
was
forced
not
only
to
sit
down
to
the
meal
she
spread
but
also
under
her
argus
eye
to
eat
of
it
when
after
a
considerable
delay
polly
at
length
appeared
she
had
removed
all
traces
of
the
tub
the
hand
was
cold
that
he
took
in
his
as
he
asked
her
if
she
would
walk
with
him
to
the
cave
this
time
she
trembled
openly
like
a
lamb
led
to
the
slaughter
he
thought
looking
down
at
her
with
tender
eyes
small
doubt
that
vulgar
creature
had
betrayed
him
to
polly
and
exaggerated
the
ordeal
that
lay
before
her
when
once
she
was
his
wife
he
would
not
consent
to
her
remaining
intimate
with
people
of
the
beamishes
kidney
what
a
joy
to
get
her
out
of
their
clutches
nor
should
she
spoil
her
pretty
shape
by
stooping
over
a
in
his
annoyance
he
forgot
to
moderate
his
pace
polly
had
to
trip
many
small
steps
to
keep
up
with
him
when
they
reached
the
entrance
to
the
cave
she
was
flushed
and
out
of
breath
mahony
stood
and
looked
down
at
her
how
young
she
was
how
young
and
innocent
every
feature
of
her
dear
little
face
still
waited
as
it
were
for
the
strokes
of
time
chisel
it
should
be
the
care
of
his
life
that
none
but
the
happiest
lines
were
graved
upon
its
precious
surface
polly
he
said
fresh
from
his
scrutiny
polly
i
not
going
to
beat
about
the
bush
with
you
i
think
you
know
i
came
here
only
to
see
you
polly
head
drooped
further
forward
now
the
rim
of
her
bonnet
hid
her
face
you
are
afraid
of
me
are
you
polly
oh
no
she
was
not
afraid
nor
have
you
forgotten
me
polly
choked
a
little
in
her
attempt
to
answer
she
could
not
tell
him
that
she
had
carried
his
letters
about
with
her
by
day
and
slept
with
them
under
her
pillow
that
she
knew
every
word
in
them
by
heart
and
had
copied
and
practised
the
bold
flourish
of
the
signature
that
she
had
never
let
his
name
cross
her
lips
that
she
thought
him
the
kindest
handsomest
cleverest
man
in
the
world
and
would
willingly
have
humbled
herself
to
the
dust
before
him
all
this
boiled
and
bubbled
in
her
as
she
brought
forth
her
poor
little
no
indeed
i
hope
not
went
on
mahony
because
polly
i
come
to
ask
you
if
you
will
be
my
wife
rocks
trees
hills
suddenly
grown
tipsy
went
round
polly
when
she
heard
these
words
said
she
shut
her
eyes
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
such
happiness
seemed
improbable
was
not
to
be
grasped
me
your
wife
she
stammered
through
her
fingers
yes
polly
do
you
think
you
could
learn
to
care
for
me
a
little
my
dear
no
do
be
in
a
hurry
to
answer
take
your
own
time
but
she
needed
none
with
what
she
felt
to
be
a
most
unmaidenly
eagerness
yet
could
not
subdue
she
blurted
out
i
know
i
could
i
i
do
thank
god
said
mahony
thank
god
for
that
he
let
his
arms
fall
to
his
sides
he
found
he
had
been
holding
them
stiffly
out
from
him
he
sat
down
and
now
take
away
your
hands
polly
and
let
me
see
your
face
do
be
ashamed
of
showing
me
what
you
feel
this
is
a
sacred
moment
for
us
we
are
promising
to
take
each
other
you
know
for
richer
for
poorer
for
better
for
worse
as
the
good
old
words
have
it
and
i
must
warn
you
my
dear
you
are
not
marrying
a
rich
man
i
live
in
a
poor
rough
place
and
have
only
a
poor
home
to
offer
you
oh
i
have
had
many
scruples
about
asking
you
to
leave
your
friends
to
come
and
share
it
with
me
polly
my
love
i
not
afraid
i
am
strong
i
can
work
and
i
shall
take
every
care
of
you
please
god
you
will
never
regret
your
choice
they
were
within
sight
of
the
house
where
they
sat
and
mahony
imagined
rude
curious
eyes
so
he
did
not
kiss
her
instead
he
drew
her
arm
though
his
and
together
they
paced
up
and
down
the
path
they
had
come
by
while
he
laid
his
plans
before
her
and
confessed
to
the
dreams
he
had
dreamt
of
their
wedded
life
it
was
a
radiant
afternoon
in
the
distance
the
sea
lay
deep
blue
with
turquoise
shallows
a
great
white
bird
of
a
ship
her
canvas
spread
to
the
breeze
was
making
for
why
he
did
not
care
whether
for
port
or
for
home
the
sun
went
down
in
a
blaze
behind
a
bank
of
emerald
green
and
little
polly
agreed
with
everything
he
said
was
all
one
lovely
glow
of
acquiescence
he
thought
no
happier
mortal
than
himself
trod
the
earth
chapter
viii
mahony
remained
at
the
hotel
till
the
following
afternoon
then
walked
to
geelong
and
took
the
to
melbourne
the
object
of
his
journey
was
to
ask
john
turnham
formal
sanction
to
his
marriage
polly
accompanied
him
a
little
way
on
his
walk
and
whenever
he
looked
back
he
saw
her
standing
fluttering
her
handkerchief
a
small
solitary
figure
on
the
bare
red
road
he
parted
from
her
with
a
sense
of
leaving
his
most
precious
possession
behind
so
close
had
words
made
the
tie
on
the
other
hand
he
was
not
sorry
to
be
out
of
range
for
a
while
of
the
beamish
family
banter
this
had
set
in
the
evening
before
as
soon
as
he
and
polly
returned
to
the
house
pacing
the
deck
of
the
little
steamer
he
writhed
anew
at
the
remembrance
jokes
at
their
expense
had
been
cracked
all
through
supper
his
want
of
appetite
for
instance
was
the
subject
of
a
dozen
crude
insinuations
and
this
though
everyone
present
knew
that
he
had
eaten
a
hearty
meal
not
two
hours
previously
had
been
kept
up
till
he
grew
stony
and
savage
and
polly
trying
hard
not
to
mind
but
red
to
the
rims
of
her
ears
slipped
out
of
the
room
supper
over
bearnish
announced
in
a
loud
voice
that
the
verandah
was
at
the
disposal
of
the
she
no
doubt
expected
them
to
bill
and
coo
in
public
as
purdy
and
matilda
had
done
on
edge
at
the
thought
he
drew
polly
into
the
comparative
seclusion
of
the
garden
here
they
strolled
up
and
down
their
promenade
bounded
at
the
lower
end
by
the
arbour
under
which
they
had
first
met
in
its
screening
shadow
he
took
the
kiss
he
had
then
been
generous
enough
to
forgo
i
think
i
loved
you
polly
directly
i
saw
you
in
the
distance
a
clump
of
hills
rose
steep
and
bare
from
the
waste
land
by
the
sea
edge
he
could
see
them
at
this
moment
as
he
leant
over
the
taffrail
with
the
sun
going
down
behind
them
they
were
the
colour
of
smoked
glass
last
night
they
had
been
white
with
moonlight
which
lay
spilled
out
upon
them
like
milk
strange
old
hills
standing
there
unchanged
unshaken
from
time
immemorial
they
made
the
troth
that
had
been
plighted
under
their
shield
seem
pitifully
frail
and
yet
the
vows
which
polly
and
he
had
found
so
new
so
wonderful
were
not
these
in
truth
as
ancient
as
the
hills
themselves
and
as
undying
countless
generations
of
human
lovers
had
uttered
them
the
lovers
passed
but
the
pledges
remained
had
put
on
immortality
in
the
course
of
their
talk
it
leaked
out
that
polly
would
not
feel
comfortable
till
her
choice
was
ratified
by
brother
john
i
sure
you
will
like
john
he
is
so
clever
i
shall
like
everyone
belonging
to
you
my
polly
as
she
lost
her
shyness
mahony
made
the
discovery
that
she
laughed
easily
and
was
fond
of
a
jest
thus
when
he
admitted
to
her
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
distinguish
one
fair
plump
sister
beamish
from
the
other
that
they
seemed
to
him
as
much
alike
as
two
firm
mushrooms
the
little
woman
was
hugely
tickled
by
his
his
masculine
want
of
perception
why
jinny
has
brown
eyes
and
tilly
blue
what
he
did
not
know
and
what
polly
did
not
confess
to
him
was
that
much
of
her
merriment
arose
from
sheer
lightness
of
she
silly
goose
that
she
was
who
had
once
believed
jinny
to
be
the
picked
object
of
his
attentions
but
she
grew
serious
again
could
he
tell
her
please
why
smith
wrote
so
seldom
to
tilly
poor
tilly
was
unhappy
at
his
long
silences
fretted
over
them
in
bed
at
night
mahony
made
excuses
for
purdy
urging
his
unsettled
mode
of
life
but
it
pleased
him
to
see
that
polly
took
sides
with
her
friend
and
loyally
espoused
her
cause
no
there
had
not
been
a
single
jarring
note
in
all
their
intercourse
each
moment
had
made
the
dear
girl
dearer
to
him
now
worse
luck
forty
odd
miles
were
between
them
again
it
had
been
agreed
that
he
should
call
at
her
brother
private
house
towards
five
in
the
afternoon
he
had
thus
to
kill
time
for
the
better
part
of
the
next
day
his
first
visit
was
to
a
jeweller
in
great
collins
street
here
he
pushed
aside
a
tray
of
showy
diamonds
a
successful
digger
was
covering
the
fat
red
hands
of
his
bride
with
them
and
chose
a
slender
discreetly
chased
setting
containing
three
small
stones
no
matter
what
household
duties
fell
to
polly
share
this
little
ring
would
not
be
out
of
place
on
her
finger
from
there
he
went
to
the
last
address
purdy
had
given
him
only
to
find
that
the
boy
had
again
disappeared
before
parting
from
purdy
the
time
before
he
had
lent
him
half
the
for
a
horse
and
dray
thus
enabling
him
to
carry
out
an
old
scheme
of
plying
for
hire
at
the
city
wharf
according
to
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
vendome
to
whom
mahony
was
referred
for
fuller
information
purdy
had
soon
tired
of
this
job
and
selling
dray
and
beast
for
what
he
could
get
had
gone
off
on
a
new
rush
to
simson
diggings
or
the
white
hills
small
wonder
miss
tilly
was
left
languishing
for
news
of
him
pricked
by
the
nervous
disquietude
of
those
who
have
to
do
with
the
law
mahony
next
repaired
to
his
solicitor
office
but
henry
ocock
was
closeted
with
a
more
important
client
this
grindle
the
clerk
whom
he
met
on
the
stairs
informed
him
with
an
evident
relish
and
with
some
hidden
hinted
meaning
in
the
corners
of
his
shifty
little
eyes
it
was
lost
on
mahony
who
was
not
the
man
to
accept
hints
from
a
stranger
the
hour
was
on
grindle
proposed
that
they
should
go
together
to
a
legal
which
offered
prime
value
for
your
money
and
where
over
the
meal
he
would
give
mahony
the
latest
news
of
his
suit
at
a
loss
how
to
get
through
the
day
the
latter
followed
him
he
was
resolved
too
to
practise
economy
from
now
on
but
when
he
sat
down
to
a
dirty
cloth
and
cruet
he
regretted
his
compliance
besides
the
news
grindle
was
able
to
give
him
amounted
to
nothing
the
case
had
not
budged
since
last
he
heard
of
it
worse
still
was
the
clerk
behaviour
for
after
lauding
the
cheapness
of
the
establishment
grindle
disputed
the
price
of
each
item
on
the
meenew
and
when
he
came
to
pay
his
bill
chuckled
over
having
been
able
to
diddle
the
waiter
of
a
penny
he
was
plainly
one
of
those
who
feel
the
constant
need
of
an
audience
and
since
there
was
no
present
for
him
to
dazzle
with
his
wit
he
applied
himself
to
demonstrating
to
his
what
a
sad
sad
dog
he
was
women
are
the
deuce
sir
he
asserted
lying
back
in
his
chair
and
sending
two
trails
of
smoke
from
his
nostrils
the
very
deuce
you
should
hear
my
governor
on
the
subject
he
tickle
your
ears
for
you
look
here
i
give
you
the
tip
this
move
you
know
to
ballarat
that
he
drivin
at
you
bet
me
there
is
a
woman
in
the
case
fact
my
word
there
is
and
a
devilish
fine
woman
too
he
shut
one
eye
and
laid
a
finger
along
his
nose
you
wo
blow
the
gab
that
why
you
could
have
your
parleyvoo
this
morning
when
milady
comes
to
town
h
o
non
est
as
long
as
she
here
and
she
with
a
hubby
of
her
own
too
what
our
old
pa
say
to
that
eh
mahony
who
could
draw
in
his
feelers
no
further
than
he
had
done
touched
the
limit
of
his
patience
my
connexion
with
ocock
is
a
purely
business
one
i
have
no
intention
of
trespassing
on
his
private
affairs
or
of
having
them
thrust
upon
me
carver
my
bill
bowing
distantly
he
stalked
out
of
the
and
back
to
the
criterion
where
he
dined
so
much
for
a
maiden
attempt
at
economy
towards
five
he
took
his
seat
in
an
omnibus
that
plied
between
the
city
and
the
seaside
suburb
of
kilda
three
miles
off
a
cool
breeze
went
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
beat
a
rataplan
on
the
hard
surface
the
great

alive
with

gigs
and

kilda
was
a
group
of
white
houses
facing
the
bay
most
were
weatherboard
with
brick
chimneys
but
there
were
also
a
few
of
a
more
solid
construction
mahony
goal
was
one
of
these
a
low
stone
villa
surrounded
by
verandahs
in
the
midst
of
tasteful
grounds
the
drive
up
to
the
door
led
through
a
shrubbery
artfully
contrived
of
the
native
behind
the
house
stretched
kitchen
and
many
rare
plants
grew
in
the
beds
there
was
a
hedge
of
geraniums
close
on
fifteen
feet
high
his
knock
was
answered
by
a
groom
who
made
a
saucy
face
turnham
and
his
lady
were
attending
the
governor
ball
this
evening
and
did
not
receive
mahony
insisted
on
the
delivery
of
his
and
since
the
servant
still
blocked
the
entrance
he
added
inform
your
master
my
man
that
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
his
sister
miss
mary
turnham
the
man
shut
him
out
left
him
standing
on
the
verandah
after
a
lengthy
absence
he
returned
and
with
a
well
come
along
in
then
opened
the
door
of
a
parlour
this
was
a
large
room
well
furnished
in
horsehair
and
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
before
a
pierglass
coloured
prints
hung
on
the
walls
while
mahony
was
admiring
the
genteel
comfort
to
which
he
had
long
been
a
stranger
john
turnham
entered
the
room
he
had
a
quiet
tread
but
took
determined
strides
at
the
floor
in
his
hand
he
held
card
and
he
looked
from
mahony
to
it
and
back
again
to
what
do
i
owe
the
pleasure
mr
er
mahony
he
asked
refreshing
his
memory
with
a
glance
at
the
pasteboard
he
spoke
in
the
brusque
tone
of
one
accustomed
to
run
through
many
applicants
in
the
course
of
an
hour
i
understand
that
you
make
use
of
my
sister
name
and
as
mahony
did
not
instantly
respond
he
snapped
out
my
time
is
short
sir
a
tinge
of
colour
mounted
to
mahony
cheeks
he
answered
with
equal
stiffness
that
is
so
i
come
from
william
beamish
hotel
and
am
commissioned
to
bring
you
your
sister
warm
love
and
regards
john
turnham
bowed
and
waited
i
have
also
to
acquaint
you
with
the
fact
continued
mahony
gathering
hauteur
as
he
went
that
the
day
before
yesterday
i
proposed
marriage
to
your
sister
and
that
she
did
me
the
honour
of
accepting
me
ah
indeed
said
john
turnham
with
a
kind
of
ironic
snort
and
may
i
ask
on
what
ground
you
on
the
ground
sir
that
i
have
a
sincere
affection
for
miss
turnham
and
believe
it
lies
in
my
power
to
make
her
happy
of
that
kindly
allow
me
to
judge
my
sister
is
a
mere
child
too
young
to
know
her
own
mind
be
seated
to
a
constraining
restraining
vision
of
little
polly
mahony
obeyed
stifling
the
near
retort
that
she
was
not
too
young
to
earn
her
living
among
strangers
the
two
men
faced
each
other
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
john
turnham
had
the
same
dark
eyes
and
hair
the
same
short
straight
nose
as
his
brother
and
sister
but
not
their
exotic
pallor
his
skin
was
bronzed
and
his
large
scarlet
mouth
supplied
a
vivid
dash
of
colour
he
wore
bushy
and
now
mahony
i
will
ask
you
a
blunt
question
i
receive
letters
regularly
from
my
sister
but
i
can
not
recall
her
ever
having
mentioned
your
name
who
and
what
are
you
who
am
i
flared
up
mahony
a
gentleman
like
yourself
sir
though
a
poor
one
as
for
miss
turnham
not
mentioning
me
in
her
letters
that
is
easily
explained
i
only
had
the
pleasure
of
making
her
acquaintance
five
or
six
weeks
ago
you
are
candid
said
polly
brother
and
smiled
without
unclosing
his
lips
but
your
reply
to
my
question
tells
me
nothing
may
i
ask
what
er
under
what
er
circumstances
you
came
out
to
the
colony
in
the
first
instance
no
sir
you
may
not
cried
mahony
and
flung
up
from
his
seat
he
scented
a
deadly
insult
in
the
question
come
come
mahony
said
turnham
in
a
more
conciliatory
tone
nothing
is
gained
by
being
techy
and
my
inquiry
is
not
unreasonable
you
are
an
entire
stranger
to
me
my
sister
has
known
you
but
for
a
few
weeks
and
is
a
young
and
inexperienced
girl
into
the
bargain
you
tell
me
you
are
a
gentleman
sir
i
had
as
lief
you
said
you
were
a
blacksmith
in
this
grand
country
of
ours
where
progress
is
the
watchword
effete
standards
and
dogging
traditions
must
go
by
the
board
grit
is
of
more
use
to
us
than
gentility
each
single
bricklayer
who
unships
serves
the
colony
better
than
a
score
of
gentlemen
in
that
i
am
absolutely
not
at
one
with
you
turnham
said
mahony
coldly
he
had
sat
down
again
feeling
rather
ashamed
of
his
violence
without
a
leaven
of
refinement
the
very
raw
material
of
which
the
existing
population
is
composed
but
turnham
interrupted
him
give
time
sir
give
time
god
bless
my
soul
rome
was
built
in
a
day
but
to
resume
i
have
repeatedly
had
occasion
to
remark
in
what
small
stead
the
training
that
fits
a
man
for
a
career
in
the
old
country
stands
him
here
and
that
is
why
i
am
dissatisfied
with
your
reply
show
me
your
muscles
sir
give
me
a
clean
bill
of
health
tell
me
if
you
have
learnt
a
trade
and
can
pay
your
way
see
i
will
be
frank
with
you
the
position
i
occupy
i
owe
entirely
to
my
own
efforts
i
landed
in
the
colony
ten
years
ago
when
this
marvellous
city
of
ours
was
little
more
than
a
village
settlement
i
had
but
five
pounds
in
my
pocket
i
am
a
partner
in
my
firm
and
intend
if
all
goes
well
to
enter
parliament
hence
i
think
i
may
without
presumption
judge
what
makes
for
success
here
and
of
the
type
of
man
to
attain
it
work
hard
work
is
the
key
to
all
doors
so
convinced
am
i
of
this
that
i
have
insisted
on
the
younger
members
of
my
family
learning
betimes
to
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
now
mahony
i
have
been
open
with
you
be
equally
frank
with
me
you
are
an
irishman
candour
invariably
disarmed
mahony
even
lay
a
little
heavy
on
him
with
the
weight
of
an
obligation
he
retaliated
with
a
light
touch
of
an
irishman
sir
in
a
country
where
the
irish
have
fallen
and
not
without
reason
into
general
disrepute
over
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
sherry
he
gave
a
rough
outline
of
the
circumstances
that
had
led
to
his
leaving
england
two
years
previously
and
of
his
dismayed
arrival
in
what
he
called
the
cesspool
of
thanks
to
the
romance
of
the
english
press
many
a
young
man
of
my
day
was
enticed
away
from
a
modest
competency
to
seek
his
fortune
here
where
it
was
pretended
that
nuggets
could
be
gathered
like
cabbages
i
myself
threw
up
a
tidy
little
country
practice
i
might
mention
that
medicine
was
my
profession
it
would
have
given
me
intense
satisfaction
turnham
to
see
one
of
those
glib
journalists
in
my
shoes
or
the
shoes
of
some
of
my
messmates
on
the
ocean
queen
there
were
men
aboard
that
ship
sir
who
were
reduced
to
beggary
before
they
could
even
set
foot
on
the
road
to
the
north
granted
it
is
the
duty
of
the
press
to
encourage
emigration
let
the
press
be
mahony
said
turnham
he
had
sat
back
crossed
his
legs
and
put
his
thumbs
in
his
armholes
let
it
be
what
we
need
here
is
colonists
small
matter
how
we
get
having
had
his
say
mahony
scamped
the
recital
of
his
own
sufferings
the
discomforts
of
the
month
he
had
been
forced
to
spend
in
melbourne
getting
his
slender
outfit
together
the
miseries
of
the
tramp
to
ballarat
on
delicate
unused
feet
among
the
of
nations
under
a
wan
december
sky
against
which
the
trunks
of
the
rose
whiter
still
and
out
of
which
blazed
a
copper
sun
with
a
misty
rim
he
scamped
too
his
attempt
at
digging
he
had
been
no
more
fit
for
the
work
than
a
child
worn
to
skin
and
bone
his
small
remaining
strength
sucked
out
by
dysentery
he
had
in
the
end
bartered
his
last
pinch
of
for
a
of
useful
odds
and
ends
and
this
had
formed
the
nucleus
of
his
store
here
fortune
had
smiled
on
him
his
flag
hardly
set
custom
had
poured
in
business
gone
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
although
i
have
never
sold
so
much
as
a
pint
of
spirits
sir
his
profits
for
the
past
six
months
equalled
a
clear
three
hundred
and
he
had
most
of
this
to
the
good
with
a
wife
to
keep
expenses
would
naturally
be
heavier
but
he
should
continue
to
lay
by
every
spare
penny
with
a
view
to
getting
back
to
england
you
have
not
the
intention
then
of
remaining
permanently
in
the
colony
not
the
least
in
the
world
h
said
john
he
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
now
his
legs
apart
that
of
course
puts
a
different
complexion
on
the
matter
still
i
may
say
i
am
entirely
reassured
by
what
you
have
told
me
entirely
so
indeed
you
must
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
the
good
sense
you
displayed
in
striking
while
the
iron
was
hot
many
a
one
of
your
medical
brethren
sir
would
have
thought
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
turn
shopkeeper
and
now
mahony
i
will
wish
you
good
day
we
shall
doubtless
meet
again
before
very
long
nay
one
moment
there
are
cases
you
will
admit
in
which
a
female
opinion
is
not
without
value
besides
i
should
be
pleased
for
you
to
see
my
wife
he
crossed
the
hall
tapped
at
a
door
and
cried
emma
my
love
will
you
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
in
response
to
this
a
lady
entered
whom
mahony
thought
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
he
had
ever
seen
she
carried
a
yearling
infant
in
her
arms
and
with
one
hand
pressed
its
pale
flaxen
poll
against
the
rich
ripe
corn
of
her
own
hair
as
if
to
dare
comparison
her
cheeks
were
of
a
delicate
rose
pink
my
love
said
turnham
and
one
felt
that
the
word
was
no
mere
flower
of
speech
my
love
here
is
someone
who
wishes
to
marry
our
polly
to
marry
our
polly
echoed
the
lady
and
smiled
a
faint
amused
smile
it
was
as
though
she
said
to
marry
this
infant
that
i
bear
on
my
arm
but
polly
is
only
a
little
girl
my
very
words
dearest
and
too
young
to
know
her
own
mind
but
you
will
decide
for
her
john
john
hung
over
his
beautiful
wife
wheeled
up
an
easy
chair
arranged
her
in
it
placed
a
footstool
pray
pray
do
not
overfatigue
yourself
emma
that
child
is
too
heavy
for
you
he
objected
as
the
babe
made
strenuous
efforts
to
kick
itself
to
its
feet
you
know
i
do
not
approve
of
you
carrying
it
yourself
nurse
is
drinking
tea
but
why
do
i
keep
a
houseful
of
domestics
if
one
of
the
others
can
not
occasionally
take
her
place
he
made
an
impetuous
step
towards
the
bell
before
he
could
reach
it
there
came
a
thumping
at
the
door
and
a
fluty
voice
cried
lem
me
in
puppa
lem
me
in
turnham
threw
the
door
open
and
admitted
a
sturdy
whom
he
led
forward
by
the
hand
my
son
he
said
not
without
pride
mahony
would
have
coaxed
the
child
to
him
but
it
ran
to
its
mother
hid
its
face
in
her
lap
forgetting
the
bell
john
struck
an
attitude
what
a
picture
he
exclaimed
what
a
picture
my
love
i
positively
must
carry
out
my
intention
of
having
you
painted
in
oils
with
the
children
round
mahony
sir
have
you
ever
seen
anything
to
equal
it
though
his
mental
attitude
might
have
been
expressed
by
a
note
of
exclamation
set
ironically
mahony
felt
constrained
to
second
turnham
enthusiasm
and
it
was
indeed
a
lovely
picture
the
gracious
woman
whose
figure
had
the
amplitude
her
gestures
the
almost
sensual
languor
of
the
young
nursing
mother
the
two
children
fawning
at
her
knee
both
with
vivid
scarlet
it
helps
one
thought
mahony
to
understand
the
of
primitive
peoples
the
nursemaid
summoned
and
the
children
borne
off
emma
exchanged
a
few
amiable
words
with
the
visitor
then
obeyed
with
an
equally
good
grace
her
husband
command
to
rest
for
an
hour
before
dressing
for
the
ball
having
escorted
her
to
another
room
turnham
came
back
rubbing
his
hands
i
am
pleased
to
be
able
to
tell
you
mahony
that
your
suit
has
my
wife
approval
you
are
highly
favoured
emma
is
not
free
with
her
liking
then
in
a
sudden
burst
of
effusion
i
could
have
wished
you
the
pleasure
sir
of
seeing
my
wife
in
evening
attire
she
will
make
a
furore
again
no
other
woman
can
hold
a
candle
to
her
in
a
ballroom
is
the
first
time
since
the
birth
of
our
second
child
that
she
will
grace
a
public
entertainment
with
her
presence
and
unfortunately
her
appearance
will
be
a
brief
one
for
the
infant
is
not
yet
wholly
weaned
he
shut
the
door
and
lowered
his
voice
you
have
had
some
experience
of
doctoring
you
say
i
should
like
a
word
with
you
in
your
medical
capacity
the
thing
is
this
my
wife
has
persisted
contrary
to
my
wishes
in
suckling
both
children
herself
quite
right
too
said
mahony
in
a
climate
like
this
their
natural
food
is
invaluable
to
babes
exactly
quite
so
said
turnham
with
a
hint
of
impatience
and
in
the
case
of
the
first
child
i
made
due
allowance
a
young
mother
the
novelty
of
the
thing
you
understand
but
with
regard
to
the
second
i
must
confess
i
how
long
sir
in
your
opinion
can
a
mother
continue
to
nurse
her
babe
without
injury
to
herself
it
is
surely
harmful
if
unduly
protracted
i
have
observed
dark
lines
about
my
wife
eyes
and
she
is
losing
her
fine
then
you
confirm
my
fears
i
shall
assert
my
authority
without
delay
and
insist
on
separation
from
the
ah
women
are
strange
beings
mahony
strange
beings
as
you
are
on
the
high
road
to
discovering
for
yourself
mahony
returned
to
town
on
foot
the
omnibus
having
ceased
to
run
as
he
walked
at
a
quick
pace
and
keeping
a
sharp
for
the
road
was
notoriously
unsafe
after
dark
he
revolved
his
impressions
of
the
interview
he
was
glad
it
was
over
and
for
polly
sake
that
it
had
passed
off
satisfactorily
it
had
made
a
poor
enough
start
at
one
moment
he
had
been
within
an
ace
of
picking
up
his
hat
and
stalking
out
but
he
found
it
difficult
at
the
present
happy
crisis
to
bear
a
grudge
even
if
it
had
not
been
a
proved
idiosyncrasy
of
his
always
to
let
a
successful
finish
erase
a
bad
beginning
none
the
less
he
would
not
have
belonged
to
the
nation
he
did
had
he
not
indulged
in
a
caustic
chuckle
and
a
pair
of
pishes
and
pshaws
at
turnham
expense
like
a
showman
in
front
of
his
booth
then
he
thought
again
of
the
domestic
scene
he
had
been
privileged
to
witness
and
grew
grave
the
beautiful
young
woman
and
her
children
might
have
served
as
model
for
a
holy
family
some
old
painter
dream
of
a
sweet
benign
madonna
the
trampling
babe
as
the
infant
christ
the
upturned
face
of
the
little
john
adoring
no
place
this
for
the
scoffer
apart
from
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
eye
there
was
ample
justification
for
turnham
transports
were
they
not
in
the
presence
of
one
of
life
sublimest
mysteries
that
of
motherhood
not
alone
the
lovely
emma
no
every
woman
who
endured
the
rigours
of
childbirth
to
bring
forth
an
immortal
soul
was
a
holy
figure
and
now
for
him
too
as
he
had
been
reminded
this
wonder
was
to
be
worked
little
polly
as
the
mother
of
his
children
what
visions
the
words
conjured
up
but
he
was
glad
polly
was
just
polly
and
not
the
peerless
creature
he
had
seen
john
turnham
fears
would
never
be
his
this
jealous
care
of
a
transient
bodily
beauty
polly
was
neither
too
rare
nor
too
fair
for
her
woman
lot
and
please
god
the
day
would
come
when
he
would
see
her
with
a
whole
cluster
of
little
ones
round
her
little
replicas
of
herself
she
bless
her
should
dandle
and
cosset
them
to
her
heart
content
her
joy
in
them
would
also
be
his
chapter
ix
he
sawed
planed
hammered
curly
shavings
dropped
and
there
was
a
pleasant
smell
of
sawdust
much
had
to
be
done
to
make
the
place
fit
to
receive
polly
a
second
outhouse
was
necessary
to
hold
the
surplus
goods
and
do
duty
as
a
for
long
jim
and
hempel
the
the
pair
had
occupied
till
now
was
being
converted
into
a
kitchen
at
great
cost
and
trouble
mahony
had
some
trees
felled
and
brought
in
from
warrenheip
with
them
he
put
up
a
rude
fence
round
his
backyard
interlacing
the
lopped
boughs
from
post
to
post
so
that
they
formed
a
thick
and
leafy
screen
he
also
filled
in
the
disused
shaft
that
had
served
as
a
and
chose
another
farther
off
which
would
be
less
malodorous
in
the
summer
heat
finally
a
substantial
load
of
firewood
carted
in
and
two
snakes
that
had
made
the
journey
in
hollow
logs
dispatched
long
jim
was
set
down
to
chop
and
split
the
wood
into
a
neat
pile
polly
would
need
but
to
walk
to
and
from
the
woodstack
for
her
firing
indoors
he
made
equal
revolution
that
her
ears
should
not
be
polluted
by
the
language
of
the
customers
he
ran
up
a
partition
between
and
store
thus
cutting
off
the
portion
of
the
house
with
its
roof
of
from
the
front
he
also
stopped
with
putty
the
worst
gaps
between
the
slabs
at
auction
rooms
he
bought
a
horsehair
sofa
to
match
his
armchair
a
strip
of
carpet
a
bed
a
and
a
and
tacked
up
a
calico
curtain
before
the
window
his
books
fetched
out
of
the
wooden
case
were
arranged
on
a
set
of
shelves
and
when
all
was
done
and
he
stood
back
to
admire
his
work
it
was
borne
in
on
him
afresh
with
how
few
he
had
hitherto
existed
plain
to
see
now
why
he
had
preferred
to
sit
rather
than
within
now
no
one
on
the
flat
had
a
trimmer
little
place
than
he
in
his
labours
he
had
the
help
of
a
friendly
digger
a
carpenter
by
trade
who
one
evening
pipe
in
mouth
had
stood
to
watch
his
amateurish
efforts
with
the
otherwise
the
lord
alone
knew
how
the
house
would
ever
have
been
made
shipshape
long
jim
was
equal
to
none
but
the
simplest
jobs
and
hempel
the
assistant
had
his
hands
full
with
the
store
well
it
was
a
blessing
at
this
juncture
that
business
could
be
left
to
him
hempel
was
as
straight
as
a
die
was
a
real
treasure
or
would
have
been
were
it
not
for
his
eternal
little
bark
of
a
cough
this
was
proof
against
all
remedies
and
the
of
it
at
night
was
quite
enough
to
spoil
a
light
sleeper
rest
in
building
the
new
shed
mahony
had
been
careful
to
choose
a
corner
far
from
the
house
marriages
were
still
uncommon
enough
on
ballarat
to
make
him
an
object
of
considerable
curiosity
people
took
to
dropping
in
of
an
evening
old
ocock
the
postmaster
a
fellow
storekeeper
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
to
comment
on
his
alterations
and
improvements
and
over
a
pipe
and
a
glass
of
sherry
he
had
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
banter
about
his
approaching
change
of
state
still
it
was
kindly
meant
we
to
git
up
a
bit
o
company
nights
for
yer
lady
when
she
comes
said
old
ocock
and
spat
under
the
table
purdy
wrote
from
tarrangower
where
he
had
drifted
hooray
old
dick
golly
for
you
old
man
did
i
kick
up
a
bobbery
when
i
heard
the
news
never
was
so
well
pleased
in
my
life
that
all
you
needed
dick
now
you
turn
into
a
colonial
how
about
that
fiver
now
i
like
to
know
you
can
tell
polly
from
me
i
shall
pay
it
back
with
interest
on
the
fatal
day
of
course
i
come
and
see
you
spliced
togs
or
no
togs
to
tell
the
truth
my
kicksies
are
on
their
very
last
legs
and
there
nothing
doing
here
all
the
loose
been
turned
over
there
oceans
of
quartz
of
course
and
trying
to
pound
it
up
in
dollies
but
you
could
put
me
to
bed
with
a
and
a
shovel
before
i
go
in
for
such
tomfoolery
as
damn
it
all
dick
to
think
of
you
being
cotched
at
last
i
ca
get
over
it
and
it
a
bit
of
a
risk
too
by
dad
it
is
for
a
girl
of
that
age
is
a
dark
horse
if
ever
there
was
one
mahony
answer
to
this
was
a
couple
of
so
that
my
best
man
shall
not
disgrace
me
his
heart
went
out
to
the
writer
dear
old
dickybird
pleased
as
punch
at
the
turn
of
events
yet
quaking
for
fear
of
imaginary
risks
with
all
purdy
respect
for
his
friend
opinions
he
had
yet
an
odd
distrust
of
that
friend
ability
to
look
after
himself
and
now
he
was
presuming
to
doubt
polly
too
like
his
imperence
what
the
dickens
did
he
know
of
polly
keenly
relishing
the
sense
of
his
own
intimate
knowledge
mahony
touched
the
in
which
polly
letters
lay
he
often
carried
them
out
with
him
to
a
little
hill
on
which
a
single
old
had
been
left
standing
its
scraggy
of
leaves
drooped
and
swayed
in
the
wind
like
the
few
long
straggling
hairs
on
an
old
man
head
the
letters
formed
a
goodly
bundle
for
polly
and
he
wrote
regularly
to
each
other
she
once
a
week
he
twice
his
bore
the
queen
head
hers
as
befitted
a
needy
little
governess
were
oftenest
delivered
by
hand
mahony
untied
the
packet
drew
a
chance
letter
from
it
and
mused
as
he
read
polly
had
still
not
ceded
much
of
her
early
reserve
and
it
had
taken
him
weeks
to
persuade
her
even
to
call
him
by
his
first
name
she
was
he
thanked
goodness
not
of
the
kind
who
throw
maidenly
modesty
to
the
winds
directly
the
binding
word
is
spoken
he
loved
her
all
the
better
for
her
wariness
of
emotion
it
tallied
with
a
like
streak
in
his
own
nature
and
this
though
at
the
moment
he
was
going
through
a
very
debauch
of
frankness
to
the
little
girl
who
pored
over
his
letters
at
beamish
family
hotel
he
unbosomed
himself
as
never
in
his
life
before
he
enlarged
on
his
tastes
and
preferences
his
likes
and
dislikes
he
gave
vent
to
his
real
feelings
for
the
country
of
his
exile
and
his
longings
for
home
told
how
he
had
come
to
the
colony
in
the
first
instance
with
the
fantastic
notion
of
redeeming
the
fortunes
of
his
family
described
his
collections
of
butterflies
and
plants
to
her
using
their
latin
names
and
polly
drank
in
his
words
and
humbly
agreed
with
all
he
wrote
or
at
least
did
not
disagree
and
from
this
as
have
done
lovers
from
the
beginning
of
time
he
inferred
a
perfect
harmony
of
mind
on
one
point
only
did
he
press
her
for
a
reply
was
she
fond
of
books
if
so
what
evenings
they
would
spend
together
he
reading
aloud
from
some
entertaining
volume
she
at
her
fancy
work
and
poetry
for
himself
he
could
truly
say
he
did
not
care
for
poetry
except
on
a
saturday
night
or
a
quiet
sunday
morning
and
that
was
because
he
liked
it
too
well
to
approach
it
with
any
but
a
tranquil
mind
i
think
if
i
know
you
aright
as
i
believe
i
do
my
polly
you
too
have
poetry
in
your
soul
he
smiled
at
her
reply
then
kissed
it
i
can
not
write
poetry
myself
said
polly
but
i
am
very
fond
of
it
and
shall
indeed
like
very
much
dear
richard
to
listen
when
you
read
but
the
winter
ran
away
one
cold
wet
week
succeeding
another
and
still
they
were
apart
mahony
urged
and
pleaded
but
could
not
get
polly
to
name
the
he
began
to
think
pressure
was
being
brought
to
bear
on
the
girl
from
another
side
naturally
the
beamishes
were
reluctant
to
let
her
go
who
would
be
so
useful
to
them
as
polly
who
undertake
without
scorn
the
education
of
the
whilom
shepherd
daughters
still
they
knew
they
had
to
lose
her
and
he
could
not
see
that
it
made
things
any
easier
for
them
to
put
off
the
evil
day
no
there
was
something
else
at
the
bottom
of
it
though
he
did
not
know
what
then
one
evening
pondering
a
letter
of
polly
he
slapped
his
forehead
and
exclaimed
aloud
at
his
own
stupidity
that
night
into
his
reply
he
slipped
four
notes
just
to
buy
yourself
any
little
thing
you
fancy
dearest
if
i
chose
a
gift
i
might
send
what
would
not
be
acceptable
to
you
yes
sure
enough
that
was
it
little
polly
had
been
in
straits
for
money
the
next
news
he
heard
was
that
she
had
bought
and
was
stitching
her
taxed
with
her
need
polly
guiltily
admitted
that
her
salary
for
the
past
three
months
was
owing
to
her
but
there
had
been
great
expenses
in
connection
with
the
hotel
and
had
had
an
accident
to
his
leg
from
what
she
wrote
though
mahony
saw
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
such
remissness
had
occurred
and
he
felt
grimly
indignant
with
her
employers
keeping
open
house
and
hospitable
to
the
point
of
vulgarity
they
were
it
was
evident
pinchfists
when
it
came
to
parting
with
their
money
still
in
the
case
of
a
little
woman
who
had
served
them
so
faithfully
in
thought
he
set
a
thick
black
mark
against
their
name
for
their
cavalier
treatment
of
his
polly
and
extended
it
to
john
turnham
as
well
john
had
made
no
move
to
put
hand
to
pocket
and
polly
niceness
of
feeling
had
stood
in
the
way
of
her
applying
to
him
for
aid
it
made
mahony
yearn
to
snatch
the
girl
to
him
then
and
there
to
set
her
free
of
all
contact
with
such
miserly
brutes
old
ocock
negotiated
the
hire
of
a
neat
spring
cart
for
him
and
a
stout
little
cob
and
at
last
the
day
had
actually
come
when
he
could
set
out
to
bring
polly
home
by
his
side
was
ned
turnham
ned
still
a
at
rotten
gully
made
no
secret
of
his
glee
at
getting
carried
down
thus
comfortably
to
polly
nuptials
they
drove
the
eternal
forty
odd
miles
to
geelong
each
stick
and
stone
of
which
was
fast
becoming
known
to
mahony
a
journey
that
remained
equally
tiresome
whether
the
red
earth
rose
as
a
thick
red
dust
or
whether
as
now
it
had
turned
to
a
mud
like
birdlime
in
which
the
wheels
sank
almost
to
the
axles
arrived
at
geelong
they
put
up
at
an
hotel
where
purdy
awaited
them
purdy
had
tramped
down
from
tarrangower
blanket
on
back
and
stood
in
need
of
a
new
from
head
to
foot
otherwise
his
persistent
had
left
no
mark
on
him
the
ceremony
took
place
early
the
following
morning
at
the
house
of
the
wesleyan
minister
the
anglican
parson
having
been
called
away
the
beamishes
and
polly
drove
to
town
a
tight
fit
in
a
double
buggy
on
the
back
seat
jinny
clung
to
and
half
supported
a
huge
which
contained
the
polly
sat
on
her
trunk
by
the
splashboard
and
tilly
crowded
out
rode
in
on
one
of
the
a
coloured
pinned
round
her
waist
to
protect
her
skirts
to
polly
disappointment
neither
her
brother
john
nor
his
wife
was
present
a
letter
came
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
say
that
emma
was
unwell
and
her
husband
did
not
care
to
leave
her
enclosed
however
were
ten
pounds
for
the
purchase
of
a
and
the
pleasure
polly
felt
at
being
able
to
announce
john
generosity
helped
to
make
up
to
her
for
his
absence
the
only
other
guest
present
was
an
elder
sister
miss
sarah
turnham
who
being
out
of
a
situation
at
the
moment
had
sailed
down
from
melbourne
this
young
lady
a
sprightly
brunette
of
some
three
or
four
and
twenty
without
the
fine
regular
features
of
ned
and
polly
but
with
tenfold
their
vivacity
and
experience
caused
quite
a
sensation
and
tilly
audible
raptures
at
beholding
her
purdy
again
were
of
short
duration
for
purdy
had
never
met
the
equal
of
miss
sarah
and
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
he
and
she
were
the
life
of
the
party
the
beamishes
were
overawed
by
the
visitor
airs
and
the
genteel
elegance
of
her
dress
polly
was
a
mere
crumpled
of
pink
confusion
mahony
too
preoccupied
with
ring
and
licence
to
take
any
but
his
formal
share
in
the
proceedings
come
and
see
you
echoed
miss
sarah
playfully
the
knot
was
tied
the
company
had
demolished
the
good
things
laid
out
by
beamish
in
the
private
parlour
of
an
hotel
and
emptied
a
couple
of
bottles
of
champagne
and
polly
had
changed
her
muslin
frock
for
a
black
silk
come
and
see
you
why
of
course
i
will
little
silly
and
with
her
pretty
white
hands
she
patted
the
already
perfect
bow
of
polly
miss
sarah
had
no
great
opinion
of
the
match
her
sister
was
making
but
she
had
been
agreeably
surprised
by
mahony
person
and
manners
and
had
said
so
thus
filling
polly
soul
with
bliss
provided
of
course
little
goosey
you
have
a
spare
room
to
offer
for
i
confess
she
went
on
turning
to
the
rest
of
the
party
i
confess
i
feel
inordinately
curious
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
what
these
famous
diggings
are
like
from
all
one
hears
they
must
be
marvellously
now
i
presume
that
you
smith
never
touch
at
such
rude
places
in
the
course
of
your
travels
purdy
who
had
discreetly
concealed
the
fact
that
he
was
but
a
digger
himself
quibbled
a
light
evasion
then
changed
the
subject
and
offered
his
escort
to
the
by
which
miss
sarah
was
returning
to
melbourne
and
you
too
dear
tilly
urged
little
polly
proceeding
with
her
farewells
for
mind
you
promised
and
i
wo
forget
to
you
know
what
tilly
sobbing
noisily
wept
on
polly
neck
that
she
wished
she
was
dead
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
polly
torn
between
pride
and
pain
at
purdy
delinquency
could
only
kiss
her
several
times
without
speaking
the
farewells
buzzed
and
flew
to
you
little
lass
beg
pardon
dr
mahony
mind
you
write
poll
i
shall
die
to
little
silly
goosey
and
au
revoir
mind
he
do
pitch
you
out
of
the
cart
polly
polly
my
duck
and
remember
come
to
you
in
a
winkin
and
when
which
speech
on
the
part
of
beamish
distressed
polly
to
the
verge
of
tears
but
finally
she
was
torn
from
their
arms
and
hoisted
into
the
cart
and
mahony
the
reins
in
his
hand
began
to
unstiffen
from
the
wooden
he
had
felt
himself
during
the
ceremony
and
under
the
whirring
tongues
and
whispered
confidences
of
the
women
and
now
polly
for
home
he
said
exultantly
when
the
largest
had
shrunk
to
the
size
of
a
nit
and
polly
had
ceased
to
twist
her
neck
for
one
last
last
glimpse
of
her
friends
and
then
the
bush
and
the
loneliness
of
the
bush
closed
round
them
it
was
the
time
of
flowers
of
fierce
young
growth
after
the
fruitful
winter
rains
the
grass
green
now
as
that
of
an
english
meadow
was
picked
out
into
patterns
by
the
scarlet
of
the
running
postman
purple
sarsaparilla
festooned
the
stems
of
the
scrub
there
were
vast
natural
paddocks
here
of
yellow
everlastings
there
of
heaths
in
full
bloom
compared
with
the
dark
spindly
foliage
of
the
the
waxy
flowers
stood
out
like
against
firs
on
damp
or
marshy
ground
wattles
were
aflame
great
quivering
masses
of
softest
gold
wherever
these
trees
stood
the
fragrance
of
their
yellow
blossoms
saturated
the
air
one
knew
before
one
saw
them
that
they
were
coming
and
long
after
they
had
been
left
behind
one
carried
their
honeyed
sweetness
with
one
against
them
no
other
scent
could
have
made
itself
felt
and
to
mahony
these
waves
of
perfume
into
which
they
were
continually
running
came
in
the
course
of
the
hours
to
stand
for
a
symbol
of
the
golden
future
for
which
he
and
polly
were
making
and
whenever
in
after
years
he
met
with
wattles
in
full
bloom
he
was
carried
back
to
the
blue
spring
day
of
this
and
jogged
on
once
more
in
the
light
cart
with
his
at
his
side
it
was
necessarily
a
silent
drive
more
rain
had
fallen
during
the
night
even
the
best
bits
of
the
road
were
worked
into
deep
glutinous
ruts
and
the
parts
were
under
water
mahony
but
a
fairish
hand
with
the
reins
was
repeatedly
obliged
to
leave
the
track
and
take
to
the
bush
where
he
steered
a
way
as
best
he
could
through
trees
stumps
boulders
and
sometimes
he
rose
to
his
feet
to
encourage
the
horse
or
he
alighted
and
pulled
it
by
the
bridle
or
put
a
shoulder
to
the
wheel
but
no
difficulties
had
power
to
daunt
him
and
the
farther
he
advanced
the
he
grew
he
went
back
to
ballarat
feeling
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
actually
going
home
and
polly
sitting
motionless
at
her
husband
side
her
hands
folded
on
her
black
silk
lap
polly
obediently
turned
her
head
this
way
and
that
when
richard
pointed
out
a
landmark
to
her
or
called
her
attention
to
the
flowers
at
first
things
were
new
and
arresting
but
the
novelty
soon
wore
off
and
as
they
went
on
and
on
and
still
on
it
began
to
seem
to
polly
who
had
never
been
farther
afield
than
a
couple
of
miles
north
of
the
pivot
city
as
if
they
were
driving
away
from
all
the
rest
of
mankind
right
into
the
very
heart
of
nowhere
the
road
grew
rougher
too
became
scored
with
ridges
and
furrows
which
threw
them
violently
from
side
to
side
unused
to
bush
driving
polly
was
sure
at
each
fresh
jolt
that
this
time
the
cart
must
tip
over
and
yet
she
preferred
the
track
and
its
dangers
to
richard
adventurous
attempts
to
carve
a
passage
through
the
scrub
a
little
later
a
cold
south
wind
sprang
up
which
struck
through
her
thin
silk
mantle
she
was
very
tired
having
been
on
her
feet
since
five
that
morning
and
all
the
happy
fuss
and
excitement
of
the
wedding
was
behind
her
her
heart
sank
she
loved
richard
dearly
if
he
had
asked
her
she
would
have
gone
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
with
him
but
at
this
moment
she
felt
both
small
and
lonely
and
she
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
beamish
big
motherly
bosom
on
which
to
lay
her
head
and
when
in
passing
a
swamp
a
noise
broke
on
her
ear
that
of
hundreds
of
which
were
like
hundreds
of
hissing
just
about
to
boil
then
such
a
rush
of
homesickness
took
her
that
she
would
have
given
all
she
had
to
know
she
was
going
back
once
more
to
the
familiar
little
whitewashed
room
she
had
shared
with
tilly
and
jinny
the
seat
of
the
cart
was
slanting
and
slippery
polly
was
continually
sliding
forward
now
by
inches
now
with
a
great
jerk
at
last
mahony
noticed
it
you
are
not
sitting
very
comfortably
polly
i
fear
he
said
polly
righted
herself
yet
again
and
reddened
it
my
my
feet
are
long
enough
she
replied
why
my
poor
little
love
cried
mahony
full
of
quick
compunction
why
did
you
say
so
and
drawing
rein
and
getting
down
he
stuffed
some
of
beamish
bundles
fragments
of
the
feast
which
the
good
woman
had
sent
with
them
under
his
wife
feet
stuffed
too
many
so
that
polly
drove
the
rest
of
the
way
with
her
knees
raised
to
a
hump
in
front
of
her
all
the
afternoon
they
had
been
making
for
dim
blue
ranges
after
leaving
the
flats
near
geelong
the
track
went
up
and
down
forest
surrounded
them
out
of
which
nobbly
hills
rose
like
islands
from
a
sea
of
trees
as
they
approached
the
end
of
their
journey
they
overtook
a
large
number
of
heavy
vehicles
labouring
along
through
the
mire
a
coach
with
six
horses
dashed
past
them
at
full
gallop
and
left
them
rapidly
behind
did
they
have
to
skirt
who
were
lashing
or
otherwise
their
teams
mahony
urged
on
the
horse
and
bade
polly
shut
her
eyes
night
had
fallen
and
a
drizzling
rain
get
in
by
the
time
they
travelled
the
last
couple
of
miles
to
ballarat
this
was
the
worst
of
all
and
polly
held
her
breath
while
the
horse
picked
its
way
among
yawning
pits
into
which
one
false
step
would
have
plunged
them
her
fears
were
not
lessened
by
hearing
that
in
several
places
the
very
road
was
undermined
and
she
was
thankful
when
richard
himself
rendered
uneasy
by
the
precious
cargo
he
bore
got
out
and
walked
at
the
head
they
drew
up
before
a
cramped
from
sitting
and
numb
with
cold
polly
climbed
stiffly
down
as
bidden
and
mahony
having
unloaded
the
baggage
mounted
to
his
seat
again
to
drive
the
cart
into
the
yard
this
was
a
false
move
as
he
was
quick
to
see
he
should
not
have
left
polly
standing
alone
for
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
doc
mahony
and
his
bride
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
all
the
loafers
who
were
in
the
bar
turned
out
to
stare
and
to
quiz
beside
her
tumulus
of
trunk
bag
bundle
little
polly
stood
desolate
with
drooping
shoulders
and
cursing
his
want
of
foresight
mahony
all
but
drove
into
the
gatepost
which
occasioned
a
loud
guffaw
nor
had
long
jim
turned
up
as
ordered
to
shoulder
the
heavy
luggage
these
blunders
made
mahony
very
hot
and
curt
having
himself
stowed
the
things
inside
the
bar
and
borrowed
a
lantern
he
drew
his
wife
arm
through
his
and
hurried
her
away
it
was
and
the
ground
was
wet
and
squelchy
their
feet
sank
in
the
mud
polly
clung
to
richard
arm
trembling
at
the
rude
voices
the
laughter
the
brawling
that
issued
from
the
at
the
continual
apparition
of
rough
bearded
men
one
of
these
who
held
a
candle
stuck
in
a
bottle
was
accosted
by
richard
and
soundly
rated
when
they
turned
out
of
the
street
with
its
few
dismal
their
way
led
them
among
dirty
tents
and
black
pits
and
they
had
to
depend
for
light
on
the
lantern
they
carried
they
crossed
a
rickety
little
bridge
over
a
flooded
river
then
climbed
a
slope
on
which
in
her
bunchy
silk
skirts
polly
slipped
and
floundered
to
stop
before
something
that
was
half
a
tent
and
half
a
what
this
the
end
of
the
long
long
journey
this
the
house
she
had
to
live
in
yes
richard
was
speaking
welcome
home
little
wife
not
much
of
a
place
you
see
but
the
best
i
can
give
you
it
it
very
nice
richard
said
polly
staunchly
but
her
lips
trembled
warding
off
the
attack
of
a
big
fierce
dirty
dog
which
sprang
at
her
dragging
its
paws
down
her
dress
polly
waited
while
her
husband
undid
the
door
then
followed
him
through
a
chaos
which
smelt
as
she
had
never
believed
any
place
could
smell
to
a
little
room
at
the
back
mahony
lighted
the
lamp
that
stood
ready
on
the
table
and
threw
a
satisfied
glance
round
his
menfolk
had
done
well
things
were
in
order
the
fire
crackled
the
kettle
was
on
the
boil
the
cloth
spread
he
turned
to
polly
to
kiss
her
welcome
to
relieve
her
of
bonnet
and
mantle
but
before
he
could
do
this
there
came
a
noise
of
rowdy
voices
of
shouting
and
parleying
picking
up
the
lantern
he
ran
out
to
see
what
the
matter
was
left
alone
polly
remained
standing
by
the
table
on
which
an
array
of
tins
was
set
preserved
salmon
sardines
condensed
milk
their
tops
forced
back
to
show
their
contents
her
heart
was
heavy
as
lead
and
she
felt
a
dull
sense
of
injury
as
well
this
hut
her
home
to
which
she
had
so
freely
invited
sister
and
friend
she
would
be
ashamed
for
them
ever
to
set
eyes
on
it
not
in
her
worst
dreams
had
she
imagined
it
as
mean
and
poor
as
this
but
perhaps
with
the
lamp
in
her
hand
she
guiltily
to
a
door
in
the
wall
it
opened
into
a
tiny
bedroom
with
a
sloping
roof
no
this
was
all
all
there
was
of
it
just
these
two
miserable
little
poky
rooms
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
round
and
the
tears
welled
up
in
spite
of
herself
the
roof
was
so
low
that
you
could
almost
touch
it
the
window
was
no
larger
than
a
there
were
chinks
between
the
slabs
of
the
walls
and
from
one
of
these
she
now
saw
a
spider
crawl
out
a
huge
black
tarantula
with
horrible
hairy
legs
polly
was
afraid
of
spiders
and
at
this
the
tears
began
to
overflow
and
to
trickle
down
her
cheeks
holding
her
skirts
to
her
the
new
dress
she
had
made
with
such
pride
now
damp
and
crushed
and
soiled
she
sat
down
and
put
her
feet
in
their
soaked
little
prunella
boots
on
the
rung
of
her
chair
for
fear
of
other
monsters
that
might
be
crawling
the
floor
and
then
while
she
sat
thus
hunched
together
the
voices
outside
were
suddenly
drowned
in
a
deafening
noise
in
a
hideous
stupefying
din
that
nearly
split
one
eardrums
it
sounded
as
though
all
the
tins
and
cans
in
the
town
were
being
beaten
and
banged
before
the
door
polly
forgot
the
tarantula
forgot
her
bitter
disappointment
with
her
new
home
her
black
eyes
wide
with
fear
her
heart
thudding
in
her
chest
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stood
ready
if
need
be
to
defend
herself
where
oh
where
was
richard
it
was
the
last
straw
when
some
five
minutes
later
mahony
came
bustling
in
he
had
soothed
the
kettledrummers
and
sent
them
off
with
a
handsome
gratuity
and
he
carried
the
trunk
on
his
own
shoulder
long
jim
following
behind
with
bags
and
bundles
when
he
entered
he
found
little
polly
sitting
with
her
head
huddled
on
her
arms
crying
as
though
her
heart
would
break
part
ii
chapter
i
over
the
fathomless
grey
seas
that
tossed
between
dissevering
the
ancient
and
gigantic
continent
from
the
tiny
motherland
unsettling
rumours
ran
after
close
on
forty
years
fat
peace
england
had
armed
for
hostilities
again
her
fleet
set
sail
for
a
foreign
sea
such
was
the
news
the
sturdy
brought
out
in
tantalising
fragments
and
those
who
like
richard
mahony
were
mere
in
the
colony
and
had
friends
and
relatives
going
to
the
front
caught
hungrily
at
every
detail
but
to
the
majority
of
the
colonists
what
england
had
done
or
left
undone
in
preparation
for
war
was
of
small
account
to
them
the
vital
question
was
will
the
wily
russian
bear
take
its
revenge
by
sending
to
annihilate
us
and
plunder
the
gold
in
our
banks
us
months
removed
from
english
aid
and
the
opinion
was
openly
expressed
that
in
casting
off
her
allegiance
to
great
britain
and
becoming
a
neutral
state
lay
young
australia
best
hope
of
safety
but
even
while
they
made
it
the
proposers
of
this
scheme
were
in
petty
local
affairs
again
all
europe
was
depressed
under
the
cloud
of
war
but
they
went
on
belabouring
hackneyed
themes
the
unlocking
of
the
lands
iniquitous
official
corruption
mahony
could
not
stand
it
his
heart
was
in
england
went
up
and
down
with
england
hopes
and
fears
he
smarted
under
the
tales
told
of
the
inefficiency
of
the
british
troops
and
the
paucity
of
their
numbers
under
the
painful
disclosures
made
by
journalists
injudiciously
allowed
to
travel
to
the
seat
of
war
he
questioned
like
many
another
of
his
class
in
the
old
country
the
wisdom
of
the
duke
of
orders
to
lay
siege
to
the
port
of
sebastopol
and
of
an
evening
when
the
store
was
closed
he
sat
over
stale
english
newspapers
and
a
map
of
the
crimea
and
meticulously
followed
the
movements
of
the
allies
but
in
this
retirement
he
was
rudely
disturbed
by
feeling
himself
touched
on
a
vulnerable
spot
that
of
his
pocket
before
the
end
of
the
year
trade
had
come
to
a
standstill
and
the
very
town
he
lived
in
was
under
martial
law
on
both
ballarat
and
the
bendigo
the
agitation
for
the
repeal
of
the
had
grown
more
and
more
vehement
and
spring
arrival
found
the
worked
up
to
a
white
heat
the
new
governor
tour
of
inspection
on
which
great
hopes
had
been
built
served
only
to
aggravate
the
trouble
misled
by
the
golden
treasures
with
which
the
diggers
anxious
as
children
to
please
dazzled
his
eyes
the
governor
decided
that
the
tax
was
not
an
outrageous
one
and
ordered
to
be
undertaken
twice
as
often
as
before
this
defeat
of
the
diggers
hopes
together
with
the
murder
of
a
comrade
and
the
acquittal
of
the
murderer
by
a
corrupt
magistrate
goaded
even
the
least
sensitive
spirits
to
rebellion
the
guilty
man
house
was
fired
the
police
were
stoned
and
then
for
a
month
or
more
deputations
and
petitions
ran
to
and
fro
between
ballarat
and
melbourne
in
vain
the
demands
of
the
voteless
diggers
went
unheard
the
consequence
was
that
one
day
at
the
beginning
of
summer
all
the
troops
that
could
be
spared
from
the
capital
along
with
several
pieces
of
artillery
were
raising
the
dust
on
the
road
to
ballarat
on
the
last
afternoon
in
november
work
was
suspended
throughout
the
diggings
and
the
more
cautious
among
the
shopkeepers
began
to
think
of
closing
their
doors
in
front
of
the
diggers
emporium
where
the
earth
was
baked
as
hard
as
a
burnt
crust
a
little
knot
of
people
stood
shading
their
eyes
from
the
sun
opposite
on
bakery
hill
a
monster
meeting
had
been
held
and
the
southern
cross
hoisted
a
blue
bunting
that
bore
the
silver
stars
of
the
constellation
after
which
it
was
named
having
sworn
allegiance
to
it
with
outstretched
hands
the
rebels
were
lining
up
to
march
off
to
drill
mahony
watched
the
thin
procession
through
narrowed
lids
in
theory
he
condemned
equally
the
blind
obstinacy
of
the
authorities
who
went
on
tightening
the
screw
and
the
foolhardiness
of
the
men
but
well
he
could
not
get
his
eye
to
shirk
one
of
the
screaming
banners
and
placards
down
with
despotism
who
so
base
as
be
a
slave
by
means
of
which
the
diggers
sought
to
inflame
popular
indignation
if
only
honest
rebels
could
get
on
without
melodramatic
exaggeration
as
it
is
those
good
fellows
yonder
are
rendering
a
just
cause
ridiculous
polly
tightened
her
clasp
of
his
arm
she
had
known
no
peace
since
the
evening
before
when
a
man
had
come
into
the
store
and
with
revolver
at
full
cock
had
commanded
hempel
to
hand
over
all
the
arms
and
ammunition
it
contained
hempel
much
to
richard
wrath
had
meekly
complied
but
it
might
have
been

himself
he
would
for
certain
have
refused
and
then
polly
had
hardly
slept
for
thinking
of
it
she
now
listened
in
deferential
silence
to
the
men
talk
but
when
old
ocock
he
never
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
the
riotous
diggers
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
remark
a
pack
o
tipperary
boys
spoilin
for
a
fight
that
what
i
say
an
yet
blow
me
if
i
would
bin
glad
if
one
o
my
two
spunk
enough
to
join
at
this
polly
could
not
refrain
from
saying
pitifully
oh
ocock
do
you
really
mean
that
for
both
purdy
and
brother
ned
were
in
the
rebel
band
and
polly
heart
was
heavy
because
of
them
ca
you
see
my
brother
anywhere
she
asked
hempel
who
held
an
old
spyglass
to
his
eyes
no
sorry
to
say
i
ca
replied
hempel
he
would
willingly
have
conjured
up
a
dozen
brothers
to
comfort
polly
but
he
could
not
swerve
from
the
truth
even
for
her
give
me
the
glass
said
mahony
and
swept
the
no
no
sign
of
either
of
them
perhaps
they
thought
better
of
it
after
listen
now
they
singing
can
you
hear
them
the
marseillaise
as
i
alive
poor
fools
many
of
them
are
armed
with
nothing
more
deadly
than
picks
and
shovels
and
pikes
corrected
hempel
several
carry
pikes
sir
ay
that
so
they
bin
out
bits
of
old
iron
all
the
mornin
agreed
ocock
it
said
they
a
quarter
of
a
firearm
apiece
and
the
drillin
lord
love
yer
of
do
know
their
right
from
their
left
the
troops
make
mincemeat
of
if
they
come
to
close
quarters
oh
i
hope
not
said
polly
oh
i
do
hope
they
wo
get
hurt
patting
her
hand
mahony
advised
his
wife
to
go
indoors
and
resume
her
household
tasks
and
since
his
lightest
wish
was
a
command
little
polly
docilely
withdrew
her
arm
and
returned
to
her
dishwashing
but
though
she
rubbed
and
scoured
with
her
usual
precision
her
heart
was
not
in
her
work
both
on
this
day
and
the
next
she
seemed
to
exist
solely
in
her
two
ears
the
one
strained
to
catch
any
scrap
of
news
about
poor
ned
the
other
listened
with
an
even
sharper
anxiety
to
what
went
on
in
the
store
several
further
attempts
were
made
to
get
arms
and
provisions
from
richard
and
each
time
an
angry
scene
ensued
close
up
beside
the
thin
partition
her
hands
locked
under
her
polly
sat
and
trembled
for
her
husband
he
had
already
got
himself
talked
about
by
refusing
to
back
a
reform
league
and
now
she
heard
him
openly
declare
to
some
one
that
he
disapproved
of
the
terms
of
this
league
from
a
to
oh
dear
if
only
he
would
but
she
was
careful
not
to
add
to
his
worries
by
speaking
of
her
fears
as
it
was
he
came
to
tea
with
a
moody
face
the
behaviour
of
the
foraging
parties
growing
more
and
more
threatening
mahony
thought
it
prudent
to
follow
the
general
example
and
put
up
his
shutters
wildly
conflicting
rumours
were
in
the
air
one
report
said
a
contingent
of
creswick
had
arrived
to
join
forces
with
the
insurgents
another
that
the
creswickers
disgusted
at
finding
neither
firearms
nor
quarters
provided
for
them
had
straightway
turned
and
marched
the
twelve
miles
home
again
for
a
time
it
was
asserted
that
lalor
the
irish
leader
had
been
bought
over
by
the
government
then
just
as
definitely
that
his
influence
alone
held
the
rebel
faction
together
towards
evening
long
jim
was
dispatched
to
find
out
how
matters
really
stood
he
brought
back
word
that
the
diggers
had
entrenched
themselves
on
a
piece
of
rising
ground
near
the
eureka
lead
behind
a
flimsy
barricade
of
logs
slabs
ropes
and
overturned
carts
the
camp
for
its
part
was
screened
by
a
breastwork
of
firewood
trusses
of
hay
and
bags
of
corn
while
the
mounted
police
stood
or
lay
fully
armed
by
their
horses
which
were
saddled
ready
for
action
at
a
moment
notice
neither
ned
nor
purdy
put
in
an
appearance
and
the
night
passed
without
news
of
them
just
before
dawn
however
mahony
was
wakened
by
a
tapping
at
the
window
thrusting
out
his
head
he
recognised
young
tommy
ocock
who
had
been
sent
by
his
father
to
tell
doctor
that
the
soldiers
were
astir
lights
could
be
seen
moving
about
the
camp
a
horse
had
neighed
father
thought
spies
might
have
given
them
the
hint
that
at
least
half
the
diggers
from
the
stockade
had
come
down
to
main
street
last
night
and
got
drunk
and
never
gone
back
with
a
concerned
glance
at
polly
mahony
struggled
into
his
clothes
he
must
make
another
effort
to
reach
the
boys
especially
ned
for
polly
sake
when
ned
had
first
announced
his
intention
of
siding
with
the
insurgents
he
had
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
believing
that
the
young
vapourer
would
soon
have
had
enough
of
it
now
he
felt
responsible
to
his
wife
for
ned
safety
ned
whose
chief
reason
for
turning
rebel
he
suspected
was
that
a
facetious
trooper
had
once
dubbed
him
eytalian
and
asked
him
where
he
kept
his
monkey
but
mahony
designs
of
a
friendly
interference
came
too
late
the
troops
had
got
away
creeping
stealthily
through
the
morning
dusk
and
he
was
still
panting
up
specimen
hill
when
he
heard
the
crack
of
a
rifle
confused
shouts
and
cries
followed
then
a
bugle
blared
and
the
next
instant
the
rattle
and
bang
of
musketry
split
the
air
together
with
a
knot
of
others
who
like
himself
had
run
forth
half
dressed
mahony
stopped
and
waited
in
extreme
anxiety
and
while
he
stood
the
stars
went
out
one
by
one
as
though
a
touched
them
the
diggers
response
to
the
volley
of
the
attacking
party
was
easily
distinguished
it
was
a
dropping
fire
and
sounded
like
a
thin
after
a
peal
of
thunder
within
half
an
hour
all
was
over
the
barricade
had
fallen
to
cheers
and
laughter
from
the
military
the
rebel
flag
was
torn
down
huts
and
tents
inside
the
enclosure
were
going
up
in
flames
towards
six
just
as
the
december
sun
huge
and
fiery
thrust
the
edge
of
its
globe
above
the
horizon
a
number
of
onlookers
ran
up
the
slope
to
all
that
was
left
of
the
stockade
on
the
dust
bloodstains
now
set
hard
as
scabs
traced
the
route
by
which
a
wretched
procession
of
prisoners
had
been
marched
to
the
camp
gaol
behind
the
demolished
barrier
huts
smouldered
as
heaps
of
blackened
embers
and
the
ground
was
strewn
with
stark
forms
which
lay
about
some
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
in
grotesque
attitudes
some
sprawled
with
outstretched
arms
their
sightless
eyes
seeming
to
fix
the
pale
azure
of
the
sky
others
were
hunched
and
huddled
in
a
last
convulsion
and
in
the
course
of
his
fruitless
search
for
friend
and
brother
an
old
instinct
reasserted
itself
in
mahony
kneeling
down
he
began
swiftly
and
dexterously
to
examine
the
prostrate
bodies
two
or
three
still
heaved
the
blood
gurgling
from
throat
and
breast
like
water
from
the
neck
of
a
bottle
here
one
had
a
mouth
plugged
with
shot
and
a
beard
as
stiff
as
though
it
were
made
of
rope
another
that
he
turned
over
was
a
german
he
had
once
heard
speak
at
a
meeting
a
windy
braggart
of
a
man
with
a
quaint
impediment
in
his
speech
well
poor
soul
he
would
never
mouth
invectives
or
tickle
the
ribs
of
an
audience
again
his
body
was
a
very
colander
of
wounds
some
had
not
bled
either
it
looked
as
though
the
soldiers
had
viciously
gone
on
prodding
and
stabbing
the
fallen
stripping
a
corpse
of
its
shirt
he
tore
off
a
piece
of
stuff
to
make
a
bandage
for
a
shattered
leg
while
he
was
binding
the
limb
to
a
board
young
tom
ran
up
to
say
that
the
military
returning
with
carts
were
arresting
every
one
they
met
in
the
vicinity
with
others
who
had
been
covering
up
and
carrying
away
their
friends
mahony
hastened
down
the
back
of
the
hill
towards
the
bush
here
was
plain
evidence
of
a
stampede
more
bloodstains
pointed
the
track
and
a
number
of
odd
and
clumsy
weapons
had
been
dropped
or
thrown
away
by
the
diggers
in
their
flight
he
went
home
with
the
relatively
good
tidings
that
neither
ned
nor
purdy
was
to
be
found
polly
was
up
and
dressed
she
had
also
lighted
the
fire
and
set
water
on
to
boil
just
in
case
was
there
ever
such
a
sensible
little
woman
said
her
husband
with
a
kiss
the
day
dragged
by
flat
and
stale
after
the
excitement
of
the
morning
no
one
ventured
far
from
cover
for
the
military
remained
under
arms
and
detachments
of
mounted
troopers
patrolled
the
streets
at
the
camp
the
hundred
odd
prisoners
were
being
sorted
out
and
the
maimed
and
wounded
doctored
in
the
rude
little
temporary
hospital
down
in
main
street
the
noise
of
hammering
went
on
hour
after
hour
the
dead
could
not
be
kept
in
the
summer
heat
must
be
got
underground
before
dark
mahony
had
just
secured
his
premises
for
the
night
when
there
came
a
rapping
at
the
back
door
in
the
yard
stood
a
stranger
who
when
the
dog
pompey
had
been
chidden
and
soothed
made
mysterious
signs
to
mahony
and
murmured
a
name
admitted
to
the
he
fished
a
scrap
of
dirty
paper
from
his
boot
mahony
put
the
candle
on
the
table
and
straightened
out
the
missive
sure
enough
it
was
in
purdy
hand
though
sadly
scrawled
have
been
hit
in
the
pin
come
if
possible
and
bring
your
tools
the
bearer
is
square
polly
could
hear
the
two
of
them
talking
in
low
urgent
tones
but
her
relief
that
the
visitor
brought
no
bad
news
of
her
brother
was
dashed
when
she
learned
that
richard
had
to
ride
out
into
the
bush
to
visit
a
sick
man
however
she
buttoned
her
bodice
and
with
her
hair
hanging
down
her
back
went
into
the
to
help
her
husband
for
he
was
turning
the
place
upside
down
he
had
a
pair
of
somewhere
he
felt
sure
if
he
could
only
lay
hands
on
them
and
while
he
ransacked
drawers
and
cupboards
for
one
or
other
of
the
few
poor
instruments
left
him
his
thoughts
went
back
inopportunely
enough
to
the
time
when
he
had
been
surgeon
dresser
in
the
edinburgh
royal
infirmary
o
tempora
o
mores
he
wondered
what
old
syme
that
prince
of
surgeons
would
say
could
he
see
his
whilom
student
raking
out
a
probe
from
among
the
ladles
and
kitchen
spoons
a
roll
of
lint
from
behind
the
saucepans
bag
in
hand
he
followed
his
guide
to
where
the
latter
had
left
a
horse
in
and
having
lengthened
the
stirrups
and
received
instructions
about
the
road
he
set
off
for
the
hut
in
the
ranges
which
purdy
had
contrived
to
reach
he
had
an
awkward
ride
of
some
four
miles
before
him
but
this
did
not
trouble
him
the
spring
had
opened
the
gates
to
a
flood
of
memories
and
as
he
jogged
along
he
in
thought
the
happy
days
spent
as
a
student
under
the
shadow
of
arthur
seat
round
the
college
the
infirmary
and
old
surgeons
square
once
more
he
sat
in
the
theatre
the
breathless
spectator
of
famous
surgical
operations
or
as
to
the
hospital
himself
assisted
in
daring
attempts
to
lessen
suffering
and
save
life
it
was
of
course
too
late
now
to
bemoan
the
fact
that
he
had
broken
with
his
profession
yet
only
that
very
day
envy
had
beset
him
the
rest
of
the
fraternity
had
run
to
and
from
the
tents
where
the
wounded
were
housed
while
he
behung
with
his
shopman
apron
pottered
about
among
barrels
and
crates
no
one
thought
of
enlisting
his
services
another
not
he
would
set
or
bungle
the
fracture
he
had
temporarily
splinted
the
hut
it
had
four
slab
walls
and
an
earthen
floor
was
in
darkness
on
his
arrival
for
purdy
had
not
dared
to
make
a
light
he
lay
tossing
restlessly
on
a
dirty
old
straw
palliasse
and
was
in
great
pain
but
greeted
his
friend
with
a
dash
of
the
old
brio
hanging
his
coat
over
the
chinks
in
the
door
and
turning
back
his
sleeves
mahony
took
up
the
lantern
and
stooped
to
examine
the
injured
leg
a
bullet
had
struck
the
right
ankle
causing
an
ugly
wound
he
washed
it
out
dressed
and
bandaged
it
he
also
bathed
the
head
and
shoulders
then
sat
down
to
await
the
owner
of
the
hut
return
as
soon
as
the
latter
appeared
he
took
his
leave
promising
to
ride
out
again
the
night
after
next
in
spite
of
the
circumstances
under
which
they
met
he
and
purdy
parted
with
a
slight
coolness
mahony
had
loudly
voiced
his
surprise
at
the
nature
of
the
wound
caused
by
the
bullet
it
was
incredible
that
any
of
the
military
could
have
borne
a
weapon
of
this
calibre
pressed
purdy
admitted
that
his
hurt
was
a
piece
of
gross
he
had
been
accidentally
shot
by
a
clumsy
fool
of
a
digger
from
an
ancient
to
mahony
this
seemed
to
cap
the
climax
and
he
did
not
mask
his
sentiments
the
pitiful
little
rebellion
all
along
but
a
futile
attempt
to
cast
straws
against
the
wind
was
now
completely
over
and
done
with
and
would
never
be
heard
of
again
or
such
at
least
he
added
was
the
earnest
hope
of
the
community
this
irritated
purdy
who
was
spumy
with
the
of
one
who
has
stood
in
the
thick
of
the
fray
he
answered
hotly
and
ended
by
rapping
out
with
a
contemptuous
click
of
the
tongue
upon
my
word
dick
you
look
at
the
whole
thing
like
the
tradesman
you
are
these
words
rankled
in
mahony
all
the
way
trust
purdy
for
not
in
anger
being
able
to
resist
giving
him
a
flick
on
the
raw
it
made
him
feel
thankful
he
was
no
longer
so
dependent
on
this
friendship
as
of
old
since
then
he
had
tasted
better
things
now
a
woman
heart
beat
in
sympathetic
understanding
there
met
his
two
lips
which
had
never
said
an
unkind
word
he
pushed
on
with
a
new
zest
reaching
home
about
dawn
and
over
his
young
wife
joy
at
his
safe
return
he
forgot
the
shifting
moods
of
his
it
had
however
this
result
next
day
polly
found
him
with
his
head
in
one
of
the
great
old
shabby
black
books
which
to
her
mind
spoilt
the
neat
appearance
of
the
bookshelves
he
stood
to
read
the
volume
lying
open
before
him
on
the
top
of
the
cold
stove
and
was
so
deeply
engrossed
that
the
rang
twice
without
his
hearing
it
when
reminded
that
hempel
was
absent
he
whipped
out
to
answer
it
he
carried
the
volume
with
him
chapter
ii
but
his
first
treatment
of
purdy
wound
was
also
his
last
two
nights
later
he
found
the
hut
deserted
and
diligently
as
he
prowled
round
it
in
the
moonlight
he
could
discover
no
clue
to
the
fate
of
its
occupants
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
head
his
horse
for
home
again
polly
was
more
fortunate
within
three
days
of
the
fight
ned
turned
up
sound
as
a
bell
he
was
sporting
a
new
hat
a
flashy
silk
neckerchief
and
a
silver
watch
and
chain
at
sight
of
these
kickshaws
a
dismal
suspicion
entered
mahony
mind
and
refused
to
be
dislodged
but
he
did
not
breathe
his
doubts
for
polly
sake
polly
was
rapturously
content
to
see
her
brother
again
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
listened
with
her
big
black
innocent
eyes
except
for
their
fleckless
candour
the
counterpart
of
ned
own
to
the
tale
of
his
miraculous
escape
and
of
the
rich
gutter
he
had
had
the
good
luck
to
strike
meanwhile
public
feeling
exasperated
beyond
measure
by
the
tragedy
of
that
summer
dawn
slowly
subsided
hesitation
timidity
and
a
very
human
waiting
on
success
had
held
many
diggers
back
from
joining
in
the
final
coup
but
the
sympathy
of
the
community
was
with
the
rebels
and
at
the
funerals
of
the
fallen
hundreds
of
mourners
in
such
black
coats
as
they
could
muster
marched
side
by
side
to
the
wild
little
unfenced
bush
cemetery
when
too
the
arrived
from
melbourne
and
martial
law
was
proclaimed
the
residents
handed
over
their
firearms
as
ordered
but
an
attempt
to
swear
in
special
constables
failed
not
a
soul
stepping
forward
in
support
of
the
government
there
was
literally
nothing
doing
during
the
month
the
military
occupied
ballarat
mahony
seized
the
opportunity
to
give
his
back
premises
a
coat
of
paint
he
also
began
to
catalogue
his
collection
of
lepidoptera
hence
as
far
as
business
was
concerned
it
was
a
timely
moment
for
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
henry
ocock
to
the
effect
that
subject
of
course
to
any
case
our
case
was
first
on
the
list
for
a
date
early
in
january
none
the
less
the
announcement
threw
mahony
into
the
fidgets
he
had
almost
clean
forgotten
the
plaguey
affair
it
had
its
roots
in
the
dark
days
before
his
marriage
he
wished
now
he
had
thought
twice
before
letting
himself
be
entangled
in
a
lawsuit
now
he
had
a
wife
dependent
on
him
and
to
lose
the
case
and
be
held
responsible
for
costs
would
cripple
him
and
such
a
verdict
was
not
at
all
unlikely
for
purdy
his
chief
witness
could
not
be
got
at
the
lord
alone
knew
where
purdy
lay
hid
he
at
once
sat
down
and
wrote
the
bad
news
to
his
solicitor
at
six
in
the
morning
some
few
days
later
he
took
his
seat
in
the
coach
for
melbourne
by
his
side
sat
johnny
ocock
the
elder
of
the
two
brothers
johnny
had
by
chance
been
within
earshot
during
the
negotiations
with
the
rascally
carrier
and
on
learning
this
henry
had
straightway
subpoenaed
him
mahony
was
none
too
well
pleased
the
boy
threatened
to
be
a
handful
his
old
father
on
delivering
him
up
at
the
had
drawn
mahony
aside
to
whisper
do
let
the
young
limb
out
o
yer
sight
or
get
nip
or
sip
o
liquor
if
so
much
as
wets
tongue
there
no
johnny
was
a
lean
youth
with
cold
flabby
hands
little
polly
had
to
stay
behind
mahony
would
have
liked
to
give
her
the
trip
and
show
her
the
sights
of
the
capital
but
the
were
no
place
for
a
woman
neither
could
he
leave
her
sitting
alone
in
a
hotel
and
a
tentative
letter
to
her
brother
john
had
not
called
forth
an
invitation
emma
was
in
delicate
health
at
present
and
had
no
mind
for
visitors
so
he
committed
polly
to
the
care
of
hempel
and
long
jim
both
of
whom
were
her
faithful
henchmen
she
herself
in
proper
wifely
fashion
proposed
to
give
her
little
house
a
good
in
its
master
absence
mahony
and
johnny
dismounted
from
the
coach
in
the
early
afternoon
sore
stiff
and
hungry
they
had
broken
their
fast
merely
on
sandwiches
keeping
their
seats
the
while
that
the
young
toper
might
be
spared
the
sight
of
intoxicating
liquors
now
stopping
only
to
brush
off
the
top
layer
of
dust
and
snatch
a
bite
of
solid
food
mahony
hastened
away
his
witness
at
heel
to
chancery
lane
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
ocock
was
not
greatly
put
out
at
purdy
having
failed
them
leave
it
to
us
sir
we
make
that
all
right
as
on
the
previous
visit
he
his
hands
while
he
spoke
and
his
little
eyes
shot
flashes
from
one
to
the
other
like
electric
sparks
he
proposed
just
to
run
through
the
morrow
evidence
with
our
young
friend
there
and
in
the
course
of
this
rehearsal
said
more
than
once
good
good
why
sonny
you
quite
smart
this
when
johnny
succeeded
in
grasping
his
drift
but
at
the
least
hint
of
unreadiness
or
hesitation
he
and
drew
his
brows
together
and
as
it
went
on
it
seemed
to
mahony
that
ocock
was
putting
words
into
the
boy
mouth
while
johnny
intimidated
said
yes
and
amen
to
things
he
could
not
possibly
know
presently
he
interfered
to
this
effect
ocock
brushed
his
remark
aside
but
after
a
second
interruption
from
mahony
i
think
sir
with
your
permission
we
will
ask
john
not
to
depart
from
what
he
actually
heard
the
lawyer
shuffled
his
papers
into
a
heap
and
said
that
would
do
for
they
would
meet
at
the
court
in
the
morning
prior
to
shaking
hands
however
he
threw
out
a
hint
that
he
would
like
a
word
with
his
brother
on
family
matters
and
for
half
an
hour
mahony
paced
the
street
below
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
spent
in
keeping
johnny
out
of
temptation
way
in
trying
to
interest
him
in
the
life
of
the
city
its
monuments
and
curiosities
but
the
lad
was
too
apathetic
to
look
about
him
and
never
opened
his
mouth
once
only
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
did
he
offer
a
kind
of
handle
in
their
peregrinations
they
passed
a
book
arcade
where
mahony
stopped
to
turn
the
leaves
of
a
volume
johnny
also
took
up
a
book
and
began
to
read
what
is
it
asked
mahony
would
you
like
to
have
it
my
boy
johnny
stonily
accepted
the
gift
it
was
a
tale
of
red
indians
the
pages
smudged
with
gaudy
illustrations
and
put
it
under
his
arm
at
the
good
supper
that
was
set
before
him
he
picked
with
a
meagre
zest
then
fell
asleep
mahony
took
the
opportunity
to
write
a
line
to
polly
to
tell
of
their
safe
arrival
and
having
sealed
the
letter
ran
out
to
post
it
he
was
not
away
for
more
than
three
minutes
but
when
he
came
back
johnny
was
gone
he
hunted
high
and
low
for
him
ransacked
the
place
without
success
the
boy
had
spoken
to
no
one
nor
had
he
been
seen
to
leave
the
and
as
the
were
nearing
twelve
mahony
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
search
and
go
back
to
the
hotel
it
was
impossible
at
that
hour
to
let
ocock
know
of
this
fresh
piece
of
besides
there
was
just
a
chance
the
young
scamp
would
turn
up
in
the
morning
morning
came
however
and
no
johnny
with
it
outwitted
and
chagrined
mahony
set
off
for
the
court
alone
day
had
broken
dim
and
misty
and
by
the
time
breakfast
was
over
a
north
wind
was
raging
a
blast
that
bore
off
the
sandy
deserts
of
the
interior
the
sun
was
a
yellow
blotch
in
a
copper
sky
the
thermometer
had
leapt
to
a
hundred
and
ten
in
the
shade
blinding
clouds
of
coarse
gritty
dust
swept
through
the
streets
mahony
fought
his
way
along
his
veil
lowered
his
handkerchief
at
his
mouth
outside
those
that
advertised
ice
crowds
stood
waiting
their
turn
of
entry
while
barmen
their
linen
trousers
drenched
with
sweat
worked
like
niggers
to
mix
drinks
which
should
quench
these
bottomless
thirsts
mahony
believed
he
was
the
only
perfectly
sober
person
in
the
lobby
of
the
court
even
ocock
himself
would
seem
to
have
been
indulging
this
suspicion
was
confirmed
by
the
lawyer
behaviour
no
sooner
did
ocock
espy
him
than
up
he
rushed
brandishing
the
note
that
had
been
got
to
him
early
that
morning
and
now
his
eyes
looked
like
little
dabs
of
pitch
in
his
face
and
his
manner
stripped
of
its
veneer
let
the
real
man
show
through
curse
it
sir
and
what
the
meaning
of
this
i
like
to
know
he
cried
and
struck
at
the
sheet
of
notepaper
with
his
free
hand
a
pretty
fix
to
put
us
in
at
the
last
minute
upon
my
word
it
was
your
business
sir
to
nurse
your
witness
after
all
the
trouble
i
been
to
with
him
what
the
devil
do
you
expect
us
to
do
now
mahony
face
paled
under
its
of
dust
and
moisture
to
ocock
gross
well
it
your
own
confound
you
entirely
your
own
he
returned
a
cool
certainly
then
moved
to
one
side
and
took
up
his
stand
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
out
of
the
way
of
the
jostle
and
bustle
the
constant
going
and
coming
that
gave
the
hinges
of
the
door
no
rest
when
after
a
weary
wait
the
time
came
to
enter
court
he
continued
to
give
ocock
who
had
been
deep
in
consultation
with
his
clerk
a
wide
berth
and
moved
forward
among
a
number
of
other
people
a
dark
stair
led
to
the
upper
storey
while
he
was
mounting
this
some
words
exchanged
in
a
low
tone
behind
him
arrested
his
attention
are
you
old
man
we
are
if
our
client
does
give
us
away
but
he
has
to
be
handled
like
a
hot
here
the
sentence
snapped
for
mahony
bitten
by
a
sudden
doubt
faced
sharply
round
but
it
was
a
stranger
who
uncivilly
accused
him
of
treading
on
his
toe
the
court
it
was
not
much
more
than
twenty
feet
square
was
like
an
oven
every
chink
and
crack
had
been
stopped
against
the
searing
wind
and
the
atmosphere
was
a
brew
of
all
the
sour
odours
the
offensive
breaths
given
off
by
the
odd
people
crushed
within
its
walls
in
spite
of
precautions
the
dust
had
got
in
it
lay
thick
on
sills
desks
and
papers
gritted
between
the
teeth
made
the
throat
raspy
as
a
file
mahony
had
given
up
all
hope
of
winning
his
case
and
looked
forward
to
the
sorry
pleasure
of
assisting
at
a
miscarriage
of
justice
during
the
speech
for
the
plaintiff
however
he
began
to
see
the
matter
in
another
light
not
so
much
thanks
to
the
speaker
as
in
spite
of
him
plaintiff
counsel
was
a
common
little
fellow
of
ungainly
appearance
a
double
toll
of
fat
bulged
over
the
neck
of
his
gown
and
his
wig
hastily
after
a
sat
askew
nor
was
he
anything
of
an
orator
he
stumbled
over
his
sentences
and
once
or
twice
lost
his
place
altogether
to
his
dry
presentment
of
the
case
nobody
seemed
to
pay
heed
the
judge
tired
of
wiping
his
spectacles
dry
leant
back
and
closed
his
eyes
mahony
believed
he
slept
as
did
also
some
of
the
jurors
deaf
to
the
citation
of
dawes
peck
and
dunlop
lambert
to
the
assertion
that
the
carrier
was
the
agent
the
goods
were
accepted
the
property
had
passed
this
passing
of
the
property
was
evidently
a
strong
point
the
plaintiff
name
itself
was
not
much
oftener
on
the
speaker
lips
the
absconding
driver
me
lud
was
a
personal
friend
of
the
defendant
bolliver
never
knew
him
hence
could
not
engage
him
had
this
person
not
been
thrust
upon
him
bolliver
would
have
employed
the
same
carrier
as
on
a
previous
occasion
and
so
on
and
on
mahony
listened
hand
at
ear
that
organ
not
being
keyed
up
to
the
mutterings
and
mumblings
of
justice
and
for
all
the
dullness
of
the
and
counsel
lack
of
eloquence
his
interest
did
not
flag
it
was
the
first
time
he
heard
the
case
for
the
other
side
stated
plainly
and
he
was
dismayed
to
find
how
convincing
it
was
put
thus
it
must
surely
gain
over
every
honest
man
in
comparison
the
points
ocock
was
going
to
advance
shrank
to
mere
legal
quibbles
and
evasions
then
the
plaintiff
himself
went
into
the
and
feelings
became
involved
as
well
this
his
adversary
this
poor
old
mangy
greybeard
who
stood
blinking
a
pair
of
rheumy
eyes
and
weakly
smiling
one
did
not
pit
oneself
against
such
human
flotsam
drunkard
was
stamped
on
every
inch
of
the
man
but
this
morning
in
odd
exception
to
the
crew
around
him
he
was
sober
bewilderedly
sober
and
his
shabby
clothing
was
brushed
his
frayed
collar
clean
recognising
the
pitiful
bid
for
sympathy
mahony
caught
himself
thinking
good
lord
i
could
have
supplied
him
with
a
coat
he
have
cut
a
better
figure
than
that
in
bolliver
clutched
the
edge
of
the
box
with
his
two
hands
his
unusual
condition
was
a
hindrance
rather
than
a
help
to
him
without
a
peg
or
two
his
woolly
thoughts
were
not
to
be
disentangled
he
stammered
forth
his
evidence
halting
either
to
piece
together
what
he
was
going
to
say
or
to
recollect
what
he
had
just
said
it
was
clear
he
went
in
mortal
fear
of
contradicting
himself
the
scene
was
painful
enough
while
he
faced
his
own
counsel
but
when
counsel
for
the
defence
rose
a
followed
in
which
mahony
wished
himself
far
from
the
court
bolliver
could
not
come
to
the
point
counsel
was
merciless
and
coarsely
jocose
and
brought
off
several
laughs
his
victim
wound
his
knotty
hands
in
and
out
and
swallowed
oftener
than
he
had
saliva
for
in
a
forlorn
endeavour
to
evade
the
pitfalls
artfully
dug
for
him
more
than
once
he
threw
a
covert
glance
that
was
like
an
appeal
for
help
at
all
the
indifferent
faces
mahony
drooped
his
head
that
their
eyes
should
not
meet
in
high
feather
at
the
effect
he
was
producing
counsel
inserted
his
left
arm
under
his
gown
and
held
the
stuff
out
from
his
back
with
the
tips
of
all
five
fingers
and
now
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
us
whether
you
ever
had
occasion
to
send
goods
by
a
carrier
before
in
the
course
of
your
young
life
yes
it
was
a
humble
monosyllable
returned
without
spirit
then
of
course
you
heard
of
this
murphy
n
no
i
have
answered
bolliver
and
let
his
vacillating
eyes
wander
to
the
judge
and
back
you
tell
that
to
the
marines
and
after
half
a
dozen
other
tricky
questions
i
put
it
to
you
it
a
fact
that
he
been
a
carrier
hereabouts
for
the
last
couple
o
years
or
more
i
do
know
i
sup
so
bolliver
tongue
grew
heavy
and
tripped
up
his
words
and
yet
you
the
cheek
you
old
rogue
you
to
insinuate
that
this
was
a
job
i
i
only
say
what
i
heard
i
do
care
a
button
what
you
heard
or
did
hear
what
i
ask
my
pretty
is
do
you
yourself
say
so
the
the
defendant
recommended
him
i
put
it
to
you
this
man
murphy
was
one
of
the
best
known
carriers
in
melbourne
and
that
was
why
the
defendant
recommended
him
are
you
out
to
deny
it
n
n
no
then
you
can
stand
down
and
leaning
over
to
grindle
who
was
below
him
counsel
whispered
with
a
pleased
spread
of
the
hand
there
you
are
that
our
case
there
was
a
painful
moment
just
before
bolliver
left
the
as
if
become
suddenly
alive
to
the
sorry
figure
he
had
cut
he
turned
to
the
judge
with
hands
clasped
exclaimed
my
lord
if
the
case
goes
against
me
i
done
and
the
defendant
got
a
down
on
me
my
lord
made
up
his
mind
to
ruin
me
look
at
him
there
a
hard
man
a
mean
man
if
ever
you
saw
one
what
would
the
bit
of
money
meant
to
but
he
was
rudely
silenced
and
hustled
away
to
a
sharp
rebuke
from
the
judge
who
woke
up
to
give
it
all
eyes
were
turned
on
mahony
under
the
fire
of
observation
they
were
comparing
him
he
knew
with
the
poor
old
jeremy
diddler
yonder
to
the
latter
disadvantage
his
spine
stiffened
and
he
held
himself
nervously
erect
but
the
quizzing
at
an
end
he
fumbled
with
his
finger
at
his
neck
his
collar
seemed
to
have
grown
too
tight
while
without
the
hot
blast
dark
with
dust
flung
itself
against
the
corners
of
the
house
and
howled
like
a
soul
in
pain
counsel
for
the
defence
made
an
excellent
impression
naturally
i
can
afford
to
pay
a
man
was
mahony
caustic
note
he
had
fallen
to
scribbling
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
was
resigned
to
sitting
through
an
adept
presentment
of
ocock
shifts
and
dodges
but
the
opening
words
made
him
prick
up
his
ears
my
lord
said
counsel
i
submit
there
is
here
no
case
to
go
to
the
jury
no
written
contract
existed
between
the
parties
to
bring
it
within
the
statute
of
frauds
therefore
the
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
defendant
accepted
these
goods
now
i
submit
to
you
on
the
plaintiff
own
admission
that
the
man
murphy
was
a
common
carrier
your
lordship
will
know
the
cases
of
hanson
armitage
and
various
others
in
which
it
has
been
established
beyond
doubt
that
a
carrier
is
not
an
agent
to
accept
goods
the
judge
had
revived
and
while
counsel
called
the
quality
of
the
undelivered
goods
in
question
and
laid
stress
on
the
fact
of
no
money
having
passed
he
turned
the
pages
of
a
thick
red
book
with
a
moistened
thumb
having
found
what
he
sought
he
pushed
up
his
spectacles
opened
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
bent
meditatively
on
the
speaker
picked
a
back
tooth
with
the
nail
of
his
first
finger
therefore
concluded
counsel
i
hold
that
there
is
no
question
of
fact
to
go
to
the
jury
i
do
not
wish
to
occupy
your
lordship
time
any
further
upon
this
submission
i
have
my
client
here
and
all
his
witnesses
are
in
court
whom
i
am
prepared
to
call
should
your
lordship
decide
against
me
on
the
present
point
but
i
do
submit
that
the
plaintiff
on
his
own
showing
has
made
out
no
case
and
that
under
the
circumstances
upon
his
own
evidence
this
action
must
fail
at
the
reference
to
witnesses
mahony
dug
his
pencil
into
the
paper
till
the
point
snapped
so
this
was
their
little
game
and
should
the
bluff
not
work
he
sat
rigid
staring
at
the
chipped
fragment
of
lead
and
did
not
look
up
throughout
the
concluding
scene
of
the
farce
it
was
over
the
judge
had
decided
in
his
favour
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
his
swept
the
dust
off
the
entire
length
of
the
ledge
in
front
of
him
but
before
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
grindle
came
flying
down
to
say
that
ocock
wished
to
speak
to
him
very
good
replied
mahony
he
would
call
at
the
office
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
but
the
clerk
left
the
courthouse
at
his
side
and
suddenly
the
thought
flashed
through
mahony
mind
the
fellow
suspects
me
of
trying
to
do
a
bolt
of
wanting
to
make
off
without
paying
my
bill
the
fashion
in
which
grindle
stuck
to
his
heels
was
not
to
be
misread
this
is
what
they
call
nursing
i
suppose
he
nursing
me
now
said
mahony
to
himself
at
the
same
time
he
reckoned
up
with
some
anxiety
the
money
he
had
in
his
pocket
should
it
prove
insufficient
who
knew
what
further
affronts
were
in
store
for
him
but
ocock
had
recovered
his
oily
sleekness
a
close
shave
that
sir
a
close
shave
with
warnock
on
the
bench
i
thought
we
could
manage
to
pull
it
off
had
it
been
guppy
now
still
all
well
that
ends
well
as
the
poet
says
and
now
for
a
trifling
matter
of
business
how
much
do
i
owe
you
the
bill
it
was
already
drawn
up
for
solicitor
and
client
costs
came
to
twenty
odd
pounds
mahony
paid
it
and
stalked
out
of
the
office
but
this
was
still
not
all
once
again
grindle
ran
after
him
and
pinned
him
to
the
floor
i
say
mahony
a
rare
joke
gad
it
enough
to
make
you
burst
your
sides
that
old
thingumbob
the
plaintiff
ye
know
now
earth
think
been
an
done
gets
outer
court
like
one
a
sorter
business
in
backyard
well
trots
an
slits
the
guts
of
every
blamed
bunny
an
chucks
the
bloody
corpses
inter
the
street
oh
lor
what
do
you
say
to
that
eh
unfurnished
in
the
upper
storey
what
heh
heh
heh
chapter
iii
how
truly
home
the
poor
little
gimcrack
shanty
had
become
to
him
mahony
grasped
only
when
he
once
more
crossed
its
threshold
and
arms
lay
round
his
neck
his
search
for
johnny
ocock
had
detained
him
in
melbourne
for
over
a
week
under
the
guidance
of
young
grindle
he
had
scoured
the
city
not
omitting
even
the
dens
of
infamy
in
the
chinese
quarter
and
he
did
not
know
which
to
be
more
saddened
by
the
revolting
sights
he
saw
or
his
guide
proud
familiarity
with
every
shade
of
vice
but
nothing
could
be
heard
of
the
missing
lad
and
at
the
suggestion
of
henry
ocock
he
put
an
advertisement
in
the
argus
offering
a
substantial
reward
for
news
of
johnny
alive
or
dead
while
waiting
to
see
what
this
would
bring
forth
he
paid
a
visit
to
john
turnham
it
had
not
been
part
of
his
scheme
to
trouble
his
new
relatives
on
this
occasion
he
bore
them
a
grudge
for
the
way
they
had
met
polly
overture
but
he
was
at
his
wits
end
how
to
kill
time
chafing
at
the
delay
was
his
main
employment
if
he
were
not
worrying
over
the
thought
of
having
to
appear
before
old
ocock
without
his
son
so
one
midday
he
called
at
turnham
place
of
business
in
flinders
lane
and
was
affably
received
by
john
who
carried
him
off
to
lunch
at
the
melbourne
club
turnham
was
a
warm
partisan
of
the
diggers
cause
he
had
addressed
a
mass
meeting
held
in
melbourne
soon
after
the
fight
on
the
eureka
and
he
now
roundly
condemned
the
government
policy
of
repression
i
am
as
you
are
aware
my
dear
mahony
no
sentimentalist
but
these
rioters
of
yours
seem
to
me
the
very
type
of
man
the
country
needs
could
we
have
a
better
bedrock
on
which
to
build
than
these
fearless
champions
of
liberty
he
set
an
excellent
meal
before
his
and
himself
ate
and
drank
heartily
unfolding
his
very
with
a
kind
of
relish
in
lunching
he
inquired
the
object
of
mahony
journey
to
town
at
the
mention
of
henry
ocock
name
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
pursed
his
lips
ah
indeed
then
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
ask
the
upshot
he
mahony
intention
of
staying
till
the
defaulting
witness
was
found
disapproved
too
the
offer
of
a
reward
to
be
paid
out
of
your
pocket
of
course
no
my
dear
mahony
set
your
mind
at
rest
and
return
to
your
wife
lads
of
that
sort
never
come
to
grief
more
the
pity
by
the
bye
how
is
polly
and
how
does
she
like
life
on
the
diggings
in
this
connection
mahony
tendered
congratulations
on
the
expected
addition
to
turnham
family
john
embarked
readily
enough
on
the
theme
of
his
beautiful
wife
but
into
his
voice
as
he
talked
came
a
note
of
impatience
or
annoyance
which
formed
an
odd
contrast
to
his
wonted
yes
her
third
and
for
some
reason
which
i
can
not
fathom
it
threatens
to
prove
the
most
trying
of
any
and
here
he
went
into
medical
detail
on
emma
state
mahony
urged
compliance
with
the
whims
of
the
even
should
they
seem
extravagant
believe
me
at
a
time
like
this
such
moods
and
caprices
have
their
use
nature
very
well
knows
what
she
is
about
nature
bah
i
am
no
great
believer
in
nature
gave
back
john
and
emptied
his
glass
of
madeira
nature
exists
to
be
coerced
and
improved
they
parted
and
mahony
went
back
to
twirl
his
thumbs
in
the
hotel
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
take
turnham
advice
and
leave
johnny
to
his
fate
and
the
delay
was
nearly
over
at
dawn
next
morning
johnny
was
found
lying
in
a
pitiable
condition
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
it
took
mahony
the
best
part
of
the
day
to
rouse
him
to
make
him
understand
he
was
not
to
be
horsewhipped
to
purchase
a
fresh
suit
of
clothing
for
him
to
get
him
in
short
halfway
ready
to
travel
the
following
day
a
craven
who
fell
into
a
cold
sweat
at
every
bump
of
the
coach
not
till
they
reached
the
end
of
the
awful
journey
even
a
chinaman
rose
to
impudence
about
nerves
his
foul
breath
his
cracked
lips
did
mahony
learn
how
the
wretched
boy
had
come
by
the
money
for
his
debauch
at
the
where
the
coach
drew
up
old
ocock
stood
grimly
waiting
with
a
leather
thong
at
his
belt
and
the
news
that
his
till
had
been
broken
open
and
robbed
of
its
contents
with
an
involuntary
recommendation
to
mercy
mahony
handed
over
the
culprit
and
turned
his
steps
home
polly
stood
on
to
kiss
him
pompey
barked
till
the
roof
rang
making
leaps
that
fell
wide
of
the
mark
the
cat
hoisted
its
tail
and
wound
purring
in
and
out
between
his
legs
tea
was
spread
on
a
clean
cloth
with
all
sorts
of
good
things
to
eat
an
english
mail
had
brought
him
a
batch
of
letters
and
journals
altogether
it
was
a
very
happy
when
he
had
had
a
and
finished
tea
over
which
he
listened
with
a
zest
that
surprised
him
to
a
hundred
and
one
domestic
details
afterwards
he
and
polly
strolled
to
the
top
of
the
little
hill
to
which
before
marriage
he
used
to
carry
her
letters
here
they
sat
and
talked
till
night
fell
and
for
the
first
time
mahony
tasted
the
dregless
pleasure
of
coming
back
from
the
world
outside
with
his
toll
of
adventure
and
being
met
by
a
woman
lively
and
disinterested
sympathy
agreeable
incidents
gained
those
that
were
the
reverse
of
pleasing
lost
their
sting
by
being
shared
with
polly
not
that
he
told
her
everything
of
the
dark
side
of
life
he
greatly
preferred
little
polly
to
remain
ignorant
still
as
far
as
it
went
it
was
a
delightful
experience
in
return
he
confessed
to
her
something
of
the
uncertainty
that
had
beset
him
on
hearing
his
opponent
counsel
state
the
case
for
the
other
side
it
was
disquieting
to
think
he
might
be
suspected
of
advancing
a
claim
that
was
not
strictly
just
suspected
you
oh
how
could
anybody
be
so
silly
for
all
the
fatigues
of
his
day
mahony
could
not
sleep
and
after
tossing
and
tumbling
for
some
time
he
rose
threw
on
his
clothing
and
went
out
to
smoke
a
pipe
in
front
of
the
store
various
worries
were
pecking
at
him
the
hint
he
had
given
polly
of
their
existence
seemed
to
have
let
them
fairly
loose
upon
him
of
course
he
would
be
he
was
suspected
of
having
connived
at
the
imposture
by
which
his
suit
was
won
why
else
have
put
it
in
the
hands
of
such
a
one
as
ocock
john
turnham
soundless
whistle
of
astonishment
recurred
to
him
and
flicked
him
imagine
it
he
richard
mahony
giving
his
sanction
to
these
queasy
tricks
it
was
bad
enough
to
know
that
ocock
at
any
rate
had
believed
him
not
averse
from
winning
by
unjust
means
yet
on
the
whole
he
thought
this
mortified
him
less
than
to
feel
that
he
had
been
written
down
a
simple
simon
whom
it
was
easy
to
impose
on
ah
well
at
best
he
had
been
but
a
kind
of
guy
set
up
for
them
to
let
off
their
verbal
fireworks
round
faith
and
that
was
all
these
wanted
the
ghost
of
an
excuse
for
parading
their
skill
justice
played
a
negligible
role
in
this
battle
of
wits
else
not
he
but
the
plaintiff
would
have
come
out
victorious
that
wretched
bolliver
the
memory
of
him
wincing
and
flushing
in
the
would
haunt
him
for
the
rest
of
his
days
he
could
see
him
too
with
equal
clearness
slitting
the
gizzards
of
his
pets
a
poor
old
derelict
the
amen
to
a
life
which
like
most
lives
had
once
been
flush
with
promise
and
it
had
been
his
honourable
portion
to
give
the
last
kick
the
ultimate
shove
into
perdition
why
he
would
rather
have
lost
the
money
ten
times
over
to
divert
his
mind
he
began
next
morning
to
make
an
inventory
of
the
goods
in
the
store
it
was
high
time
too
thanks
to
the
recent
disturbances
he
did
not
know
where
he
stood
and
while
he
was
about
it
he
gave
the
place
a
general
a
job
of
this
kind
was
a
powerful
ally
in
keeping
edged
thoughts
at
bay
he
and
his
men
had
their
hands
full
for
several
days
polly
who
was
not
allowed
to
set
foot
in
the
store
peeping
critically
in
at
them
to
see
how
they
progressed
and
after
business
hours
there
was
little
polly
herself
he
loved
to
contemplate
her
six
months
of
married
life
had
worked
certain
changes
in
his
slip
of
a
girl
but
something
of
the
shyness
that
had
caught
his
fancy
still
clung
to
her
with
strangers
she
could
even
yet
be
touchingly
bashful
not
long
out
of
short
frocks
she
found
it
difficult
to
stand
upon
her
dignity
as
mahony
besides
it
was
second
nature
to
polly
to
efface
herself
to
steal
mousily
away
unless
of
course
some
one
needed
help
or
was
in
distress
in
which
case
she
forgot
to
be
shy
to
her
husband
habits
and
idiosyncrasies
she
had
adapted
herself
implicitly
but
this
came
easy
for
she
was
sure
everything
richard
did
was
right
and
that
his
way
of
looking
at
things
was
the
one
and
only
way
so
there
was
no
room
for
discord
between
them
by
this
time
polly
could
laugh
over
the
dismay
of
her
first
homecoming
the
night
and
unfamiliar
road
the
racket
of
the
serenade
the
apparition
of
the
great
spider
now
all
this
might
have
happened
to
somebody
else
not
polly
mahony
her
dislike
of
things
that
creep
and
crawl
was
it
is
true
inborn
and
persisted
but
nowadays
if
one
of
the
many
triantelopes
that
infested
the
roof
showed
its
hairy
legs
she
had
only
to
call
hempel
and
out
the
latter
would
pop
with
a
broomstick
to
do
away
with
the
creature
if
a
scorpion
or
a
centipede
wriggled
from
under
a
log
the
cry
of
tom
would
bring
the
idle
lad
next
door
over
the
fence
polly
had
learnt
not
to
summon
her
husband
on
these
occasions
for
richard
held
to
the
maxim
live
and
let
live
if
at
night
a
tarantula
appeared
on
the
he
caught
it
in
a
covered
glass
and
carried
it
outside
just
to
come
in
again
was
her
rueful
reflection
but
indeed
polly
was
surrounded
by
willing
helpers
and
small
wonder
thought
mahony
her
young
nerves
were
so
sound
that
hempel
dry
cough
never
grated
them
she
doctored
him
and
fussed
over
him
and
was
worried
that
she
could
not
cure
him
she
met
long
jim
grumbles
with
a
sunny
face
and
listened
patiently
to
his
forebodings
that
he
would
never
see
home
or
his
old
woman
again
she
even
brought
out
a
clumsy
in
the
young
varmint
tom
nor
did
his
old
father
want
of
refinement
repel
her
but
richard
he
such
a
kind
old
man
she
met
her
admission
of
this
and
it
is
his
fault
that
he
was
properly
educated
he
has
had
to
work
for
his
living
ever
since
he
was
twelve
years
old
and
ocock
cried
quits
by
remarking
confidentially
that
little
lady
o
yours
got
screwed
on
the
right
way
it
beats
me
why
you
do
take
inter
the
store
and
learn
the
bizness
no
offence
i
sure
he
made
haste
to
add
disconcerted
by
mahony
cold
stare
had
anyone
at
this
date
tried
to
tell
polly
she
lived
in
a
mean
rough
home
he
would
have
had
a
poor
reception
polly
was
long
since
certain
that
not
a
house
on
the
diggings
could
compare
with
theirs
this
was
a
trait
mahony
loved
in
her
her
sterling
loyalty
a
loyalty
that
embraced
not
only
her
dear
ones
themselves
but
every
stick
and
stone
belonging
to
them
his
discovery
of
it
helped
him
to
understand
her
allegiance
to
her
own
multicoloured
family
in
the
beginning
he
had
almost
doubted
its
sincerity
now
he
knew
her
better
it
was
just
as
though
a
sixth
sense
had
been
implanted
in
polly
enabling
her
to
pierce
straight
through
john
or
ned
vapourings
to
the
real
kernel
of
goodness
that
no
doubt
lay
hid
below
he
himself
could
not
get
at
it
but
then
his
powers
of
divination
were
the
exact
opposite
of
polly
he
was
always
struck
by
the
weak
or
ridiculous
side
of
a
person
and
had
to
dig
laboriously
down
to
the
virtues
while
his
young
wife
by
a
kind
of
genius
saw
the
good
at
a
glance
and
saw
nothing
else
and
she
did
not
stint
with
her
gift
or
hoard
it
up
solely
for
use
on
her
own
kith
and
kin
her
splendid
sympathy
was
the
reverse
of
clannish
it
was
applied
to
every
mortal
who
crossed
her
path
yes
for
all
her
youth
polly
had
quite
a
character
of
her
own
and
even
thus
early
her
husband
sometimes
ran
up
against
a
certain
native
sturdiness
of
opinion
but
this
did
not
displease
him
on
the
contrary
he
would
have
thanked
you
for
a
wife
who
was
only
an
echo
of
himself
to
take
the
case
of
the
animals
he
had
a
profound
respect
for
those
creatures
to
which
speech
has
been
denied
and
he
treated
the
that
dwelt
under
his
roof
as
his
fellows
humanising
them
reading
his
own
thoughts
into
them
and
showing
more
consideration
for
their
feelings
than
if
they
had
been
able
to
speak
up
for
themselves
polly
saw
this
in
the
light
of
an
exquisite
joke
she
was
always
kind
to
pompey
and
the
stately
palmerston
and
would
as
soon
have
forgotten
to
set
richard
dinner
before
him
as
to
feed
the
pair
but
they
remained
the
dog
and
the
cat
to
her
and
if
they
had
enough
to
eat
and
received
neither
kicks
nor
blows
she
could
not
conceive
of
their
souls
asking
more
it
went
beyond
her
to
study
the
cat
dislike
to
being
turned
off
its
favourite
chair
or
to
believe
that
the
dog
did
not
make
dirty
prints
on
her
fresh
scrubbed
floor
out
of
malice
prepense
it
was
also
incredible
that
he
should
have
doggy
fits
of
depression
in
which
up
he
must
to
stick
a
cold
slobbery
snout
into
a
warm
human
hand
and
when
richard
tried
to
conciliate
palmerston
stalking
sulky
to
the
door
or
to
pet
away
the
melancholy
in
the
rejected
pompey
eyes
polly
had
to
lay
down
her
sewing
and
laugh
at
her
husband
so
greatly
did
his
behaviour
amuse
her
again
there
was
the
question
of
literature
books
to
mahony
were
almost
as
necessary
as
bread
to
his
on
the
other
hand
they
seemed
a
somewhat
needless
luxury
less
vital
by
far
than
the
animals
that
walked
the
floor
she
took
great
care
of
the
precious
volumes
richard
had
had
carted
up
from
melbourne
but
the
cost
of
the
transport
was
what
impressed
her
most
it
was
not
an
overstatement
thought
mahony
to
say
that
a
stack
of
neatly
piled
wood
meant
more
to
polly
than
all
the
books
ever
written
not
that
she
did
not
enjoy
a
good
story
her
work
done
she
liked
few
things
better
and
he
often
smiled
at
the
ease
with
which
she
lived
herself
into
the
world
of
knowing
of
course
that
it
was
and
just
a
kind
of
humbug
but
poetry
and
the
higher
fiction
little
professed
love
for
poetry
had
been
merely
a
concession
to
the
conventional
idea
of
girlhood
or
at
best
such
a
burning
wish
to
be
all
her
richard
desired
that
at
the
moment
she
was
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
she
said
but
did
he
read
to
her
from
his
favourite
authors
her
attention
would
wander
in
spite
of
the
efforts
she
made
to
pin
it
down
mahony
declaimed
the
sunset
of
life
gives
us
mystical
lore
and
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
and
his
pleasure
in
the
swing
of
the
couplet
was
such
that
he
repeated
it
polly
wakened
with
a
start
her
thoughts
had
been
miles
away
had
been
back
at
the
family
hotel
there
purdy
after
several
adventures
his
poor
leg
a
mass
of
supuration
had
at
length
betaken
himself
to
be
looked
after
by
his
tilly
and
polly
hopes
were
all
alight
again
she
blushed
guiltily
at
the
repetition
and
asked
her
husband
to
say
the
lines
once
again
he
did
so
but
they
do
really
richard
do
they
she
said
in
an
apologetic
tone
she
referred
to
the
casting
of
shadows
it
would
be
so
useful
if
they
did
and
she
drew
a
sigh
at
purdy
dilatory
treatment
of
the
girl
who
loved
him
so
well
oh
you
prosaic
little
woman
cried
mahony
and
laid
down
his
book
to
kiss
her
it
was
impossible
to
be
vexed
with
polly
she
was
so
honest
so
transparent
did
you
never
hear
of
a
certain
something
called
poetic
licence
no
polly
was
more
or
less
familiar
with
various
other
forms
of
licence
from
the
that
had
caused
all
the
fuss
down
to
the
special
licence
by
which
she
had
been
married
but
this
particular
one
had
not
come
her
way
and
on
richard
explaining
to
her
the
liberty
poets
allowed
themselves
she
shifted
uncomfortably
in
her
chair
and
was
sorry
to
think
he
approved
it
seemed
to
her
just
a
fine
name
for
wanton
exaggeration
if
not
something
worse
there
were
also
those
long
evenings
they
spent
over
the
first
hundred
pages
of
waverley
mahony
eager
for
her
to
share
his
enthusiasm
comforted
her
each
night
anew
that
they
would
soon
reach
the
story
proper
and
then
how
interested
she
would
be
but
the
opening
chapters
were
a
sandy
desert
of
words
all
about
people
duller
than
any
polly
had
known
alive
and
sometimes
before
the
book
was
brought
out
she
would
heave
a
secret
sigh
although
of
course
she
enjoyed
sitting
cosily
together
with
richard
watching
him
and
listening
to
his
voice
but
they
might
have
put
their
time
to
a
pleasanter
use
by
talking
of
themselves
or
their
friends
or
how
further
to
improve
their
home
or
what
the
store
was
doing
mahony
saw
her
smiling
to
herself
one
evening
and
after
assuring
himself
that
there
was
nothing
on
the
page
before
him
to
call
that
pleased
look
to
her
young
face
he
laid
the
book
down
and
offered
her
a
penny
for
her
thoughts
but
polly
was
loath
to
confess
to
i
have
succeeded
in
interesting
you
have
i
pollikins
she
made
haste
to
contradict
him
oh
it
was
very
nice
and
she
loved
to
hear
him
read
come
honestly
now
little
woman
she
faced
him
squarely
at
that
though
with
pink
cheeks
well
not
much
richard
he
took
her
on
his
knee
and
what
were
you
smiling
at
me
oh
i
was
just
thinking
of
something
that
happened
yesterday
and
polly
sat
up
agog
to
tell
it
appeared
that
the
day
before
while
he
was
out
the
digger
wife
who
did
polly
rough
work
for
her
had
rushed
in
crying
that
her
youngest
was
choking
bonnetless
polly
had
flown
across
to
the
hut
there
she
discovered
the
child
a
fat
youngster
of
a
year
or
so
purple
in
the
face
with
a
button
wedged
in
its
throat
taking
it
by
the
heels
she
shook
the
child
vigorously
and
lo
and
behold
this
had
the
opposite
effect
to
what
she
intended
when
they
straightened
the
child
out
again
the
button
was
found
to
have
passed
the
and
gone
down
quickly
resolved
polly
cut
slice
on
slice
of
thin
and
with
this
she
and
hemmerde
stuffed
the
willing
babe
till
full
to
bursting
it
warded
them
off
with
its
tiny
hands
mahony
laughed
heartily
at
the
tale
and
applauded
his
wife
prompt
measures
short
of
the
forceps
nothing
could
have
been
better
yes
polly
had
a
dash
of
native
shrewdness
which
he
prized
and
a
pair
of
clever
hands
that
were
never
idle
he
had
given
her
leave
to
make
any
changes
she
chose
in
the
house
and
she
was
for
ever
stitching
away
at
white
muslin
or
tacking
it
over
pink
calico
these
affairs
made
their
little
home
very
spick
and
span
and
kept
polly
from
feeling
dull
if
one
could
imagine
polly
dull
with
the
cooking
alone
had
there
been
a
hitch
in
the
beginning
like
a
true
expert
beamish
had
not
tolerated
understudies
none
but
the
lowliest
jobs
such
as
or
had
fallen
to
the
three
girls
share
and
in
face
of
her
first
fowl
polly
stood
helpless
and
dismayed
but
not
for
long
sarah
was
applied
to
for
the
best
on
sale
in
melbourne
and
when
this
arrived
polly
gave
herself
up
to
the
study
of
it
she
had
many
failures
both
private
and
avowed
with
the
worst
she
either
retired
behind
the
woodstack
or
tom
disposed
of
them
for
her
or
the
dog
ate
them
up
but
she
persevered
and
soon
mahony
could
with
truth
declare
that
no
one
raised
a
better
loaf
or
had
a
lighter
hand
at
pastry
than
his
wife
three
knocks
on
the
wooden
partition
was
the
signal
which
if
he
were
not
serving
a
customer
summoned
him
to
the
kitchen
oh
richard
it
ripen
beautifully
and
red
with
heat
and
pride
polly
drew
a
great
along
the
oven
shelf
richard
who
had
a
sweet
tooth
pretended
to
be
unable
to
curb
his
impatience
wait
first
i
must
see
and
she
plunged
a
knife
into
the
heart
it
came
out
untarnished
yes
it
done
to
a
turn
there
and
then
it
was
cut
for
said
mahony
that
was
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
make
sure
of
a
piece
afterwards
chunks
were
dealt
out
to
every
one
polly
knew
to
long
jim
hempel
tommy
ocock
the
little
hemmerdes
side
by
side
on
the
their
feet
dangling
in
the
air
husband
and
wife
sat
fashion
and
munched
hot
cake
till
their
appetites
for
dinner
were
wrecked
but
the
rains
that
heralded
winter
and
they
set
in
early
that
year
had
not
begun
to
fall
when
more
serious
matters
claimed
attention
chapter
iv
it
was
an
odd
and
inexplicable
thing
that
business
showed
no
sign
of
improving
affairs
on
ballarat
had
for
months
past
run
their
usual
prosperous
course
the
western
township
grew
from
day
to
day
and
was
straggling
right
out
to
the
banks
of
the
great
swamp
on
the
flat
the
deep
sinking
that
was
at
present
the
rule
some
parties
actually
touched
a
depth
of
three
hundred
feet
before
bottoming
had
brought
a
fresh
host
of
to
the
spot
and
the
results
obtained
bid
fair
to
rival
those
of
the
first
golden
year
the
diggers
grievances
and
their
conflict
with
the
government
were
now
a
turned
page
at
a
state
trial
all
prisoners
had
been
acquitted
and
a
general
amnesty
declared
for
those
rebels
who
were
still
at
large
unpopular
ministers
had
resigned
or
died
a
new
constitution
for
the
colony
awaited
the
royal
assent
and
pending
this
two
of
the
now
prominent
townsmen
were
chosen
to
sit
in
the
legislative
council
the
future
could
not
have
looked
rosier
for
others
that
was
for
him
mahony
it
held
more
than
one
element
of
uncertainty
at
no
time
had
he
come
near
making
a
fortune
out
of
storekeeping
for
one
thing
he
had
been
too
squeamish
from
the
outset
he
had
declined
to
soil
his
hands
with
surreptitious
nor
would
he
be
a
party
to
that
evasion
of
the
law
which
consisted
in
overcharging
on
other
goods
and
throwing
in
drinks
free
again
he
would
rather
have
been
hamstrung
than
stoop
to
the
tricks
in
vogue
with
regard
to
the
weighing
of
the
greased
scales
the
wet
sponge
false
beams
and
so
on
accordingly
he
had
a
clearer
conscience
than
the
majority
and
a
lighter
till
but
even
at
the
legitimate
abc
of
business
he
had
proved
a
duffer
he
had
never
for
instance
learned
to
be
a
really
skilled
hand
at
stocking
a
shop
was
an
article
called
for
ten
to
one
he
had
run
short
of
it
and
the
born
shopman
knack
of
palming
off
or
persuading
to
a
makeshift
was
not
his
such
goods
as
he
had
he
did
not
press
on
people
his
attitude
was
always
that
of
take
it
or
leave
it
and
he
sometimes
surprised
a
ridiculous
feeling
of
satisfaction
when
he
chased
a
drunken
and
insolent
customer
off
the
premises
or
secured
an
hour
leisure
unbroken
by
the
jangle
of
the
still
in
spite
of
everything
he
had
till
recently
done
well
enough
money
was
loose
and
the
diggers
if
given
long
credit
when
down
on
their
luck
were
in
the
main
to
be
relied
on
to
pay
up
when
they
struck
the
lead
or
tapped
a
pocket
he
had
had
slack
seasons
before
now
and
things
had
always
come
right
again
this
made
it
hard
for
him
to
explain
the
present
prolonged
spell
of
dullness
that
there
was
something
more
than
ordinarily
wrong
first
dawned
on
him
during
the
in
summer
hempel
and
he
were
constantly
coming
upon
goods
that
had
been
too
long
on
hand
and
were
now
fit
only
to
be
thrown
away
boxes
of
currants
showed
a
respectable
growth
of
mould
a
like
fate
had
come
upon
some
flitches
of
bacon
and
not
a
bag
of
flour
but
had
developed
a
species
of
minute
maggot
rats
had
got
at
his
coils
of
rope
one
of
which
sold
in
all
good
faith
had
gone
near
causing
the
death
of
the
digger
who
used
it
the
remains
of
some
smoked
fish
were
brought
back
and
flung
at
his
head
with
a
shower
of
curses
by
a
woman
who
had
fallen
ill
through
eating
of
it
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
replenishing
this
involved
the
order
he
sent
to
town
that
season
was
the
smallest
he
had
ever
given
for
the
first
time
he
could
not
fill
a
dray
but
had
to
share
one
with
a
greenhorn
who
if
you
please
was
setting
up
at
his
very
door
he
and
hempel
cracked
their
brains
to
account
for
the
or
at
least
he
did
afterwards
he
believed
hempel
had
suspected
the
truth
and
been
too
to
speak
out
it
was
polly
who
innocently
for
of
course
he
did
not
draw
her
into
confidence
polly
supplied
the
clue
from
a
piece
of
gossip
brought
to
the
house
by
the
woman
hemmerde
it
appeared
that
at
the
time
of
the
rebellion
mahony
open
antagonism
to
the
reform
league
had
given
offence
all
round
to
the
extremists
as
well
as
to
the
more
wary
on
whose
behalf
the
league
was
drafted
they
now
got
even
with
him
by
taking
their
custom
elsewhere
he
snorted
with
indignation
on
hearing
of
it
then
laughed
ironically
he
was
expected
was
he
not
only
to
bring
his
personal
tastes
and
habits
into
line
with
those
of
the
majority
but
to
deny
his
politics
as
well
and
if
he
refused
they
would
make
it
hard
for
him
to
earn
a
decent
living
in
their
midst
nothing
seemed
easier
to
these
unprincipled
democrats
than
for
a
man
to
cut
his
coat
to
suit
his
job
why
he
might
just
as
well
turn
whig
and
be
done
with
it
he
sat
over
his
the
pages
were
black
with
bad
debts
for
tucker
here
however
was
no
mystery
the
owners
of
these
names
purdy
was
among
them
had
without
doubt
been
implicated
in
the
eureka
riot
and
had
made
off
and
never
returned
he
struck
a
balance
and
found
to
his
consternation
that
unless
business
took
a
turn
for
the
better
he
would
not
be
able
to
hold
out
beyond
the
end
of
the
year
afterwards
he
was
blessed
if
he
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
the
ingenious
hempel
was
full
of
ideas
for
tempting
back
fortune
opening
a
branch
store
on
a
new
lead
was
one
of
them
or
removing
bodily
to
main
street
but
ready
money
was
the
sine
qua
non
of
such
schemes
and
ready
money
he
had
not
got
since
his
marriage
he
had
put
by
as
good
as
nothing
and
the
enlarging
and
improving
of
his
house
at
that
time
had
made
a
big
hole
in
his
bachelor
savings
he
did
not
feel
justified
at
the
present
pass
in
drawing
on
them
anew
for
one
thing
before
summer
was
out
there
would
be
if
all
went
well
another
mouth
to
feed
and
that
meant
a
variety
of
seen
and
unforeseen
expenses
such
were
the
material
anxieties
he
had
to
encounter
in
the
course
of
that
winter
below
the
surface
a
subtler
embarrassment
worked
to
destroy
his
peace
in
face
of
the
shortage
of
money
he
was
obliged
to
thank
his
stars
that
he
had
not
lost
the
miserable
lawsuit
of
a
few
months
back
had
that
happened
he
would
at
present
have
known
where
to
turn
but
this
amounted
to
confessing
his
satisfaction
at
having
pulled
off
his
case
pulled
it
off
anyhow
by
no
matter
what
crooked
means
and
as
if
this
were
not
enough
the
last
words
he
had
heard
purdy
say
came
back
to
sting
him
anew
the
boy
had
accused
him
of
judging
a
fight
for
freedom
from
a
tradesman
standpoint
now
it
might
be
said
of
him
that
he
was
viewing
justice
from
the
same
angle
he
had
scorned
the
idea
of
distorting
his
political
opinions
to
fit
the
trade
by
which
he
gained
his
bread
but
it
was
a
far
more
serious
thing
if
his
principles
his
character
his
sense
of
equity
were
all
to
be
undermined
as
well
if
he
stayed
here
he
would
end
by
becoming
as
blunt
to
what
was
right
and
fair
as
the
rest
of
them
as
it
was
he
was
no
longer
able
to
regard
the
two
great
landmarks
of
man
moral
development
liberty
and
justice
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
honest
man
and
a
gentleman
his
was
so
great
that
it
galvanised
him
to
action
there
and
then
he
made
up
his
mind
as
soon
as
the
child
that
was
coming
to
them
was
old
enough
to
travel
he
would
sell
out
for
what
he
could
get
and
go
back
to
the
old
country
once
upon
a
time
he
had
hoped
when
he
went
to
take
a
good
round
sum
with
him
towards
a
english
practice
now
he
saw
that
this
scheme
had
been
a
kind
of
a
after
which
he
might
have
danced
for
years
to
come
as
matters
stood
he
must
needs
be
content
if
the
paid
he
could
scrape
together
enough
to
keep
him
afloat
till
he
found
a
modest
corner
to
slip
into
his
first
impulse
was
to
say
nothing
of
this
to
his
wife
in
the
meantime
why
unsettle
her
but
he
had
reckoned
without
the
sudden
upward
leap
his
spirits
made
once
his
decision
was
taken
the
winter
sky
was
blue
as
violets
again
above
him
he
turned
out
of
a
morning
it
was
impossible
to
hide
the
change
in
his
mood
from
polly
even
if
he
had
felt
it
fair
to
do
so
another
thing
when
he
came
to
study
polly
by
the
light
of
his
new
plan
he
saw
that
his
scruples
about
unsettling
her
were
fanciful
wraiths
of
his
own
imagining
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
sooner
he
broke
the
news
to
her
the
better
little
polly
was
so
thoroughly
happy
here
that
she
would
need
time
to
accustom
herself
to
the
prospect
of
life
elsewhere
he
went
about
it
very
cautiously
though
and
with
no
hint
of
the
sour
and
sorry
incidents
that
had
driven
him
to
the
step
as
was
only
natural
polly
was
rather
easily
upset
at
present
the
very
evening
before
he
had
had
occasion
to
blame
himself
for
his
tactless
behaviour
in
her
first
sick
young
fear
polly
had
impulsively
written
off
to
mother
beamish
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
that
good
woman
promise
to
stand
by
her
when
her
time
came
one
letter
gave
another
beamish
not
only
announced
that
she
would
hold
herself
ready
to
support
her
little
duck
at
a
moment
notice
but
filled
sheets
with
sage
advice
and
old
wives
maxims
and
the
correspondence
which
had
languished
flared
up
anew
now
came
an
misspelt
epistle
from
tilly
doleful
too
for
purdy
had
once
more
quitted
her
without
speaking
the
binding
word
in
which
she
told
that
purdy
leg
though
healed
was
permanently
shortened
the
doctor
in
geelong
said
he
would
never
walk
straight
again
husband
and
wife
sat
and
discussed
the
news
wondered
how
lameness
would
affect
purdy
future
and
what
he
was
doing
now
tilly
not
having
mentioned
his
whereabouts
she
has
probably
no
more
idea
than
we
have
said
mahony
i
afraid
not
said
polly
with
a
sigh
well
i
hope
he
wo
come
back
here
that
all
and
she
considered
the
seam
she
was
sewing
with
an
absent
air
why
love
do
you
like
old
dickybird
asked
mahony
in
no
small
surprise
oh
yes
quite
well
but
is
it
because
he
still
ca
make
up
his
mind
to
take
your
tilly
eh
that
too
but
chiefly
because
of
something
he
said
and
what
was
that
my
dear
oh
very
silly
and
polly
smiled
out
with
it
madam
or
i
shall
suspect
the
young
dog
of
having
made
advances
to
my
wife
richard
dear
little
polly
thought
he
was
in
earnest
and
grew
exceedingly
confused
oh
no
nothing
like
that
she
assured
him
and
with
red
cheeks
rushed
into
an
explanation
he
only
said
in
spite
of
you
being
such
old
friends
he
felt
you
did
really
care
to
have
him
here
on
ballarat
after
a
time
you
always
invented
some
excuse
to
get
him
away
but
now
that
it
was
out
polly
felt
the
need
of
toning
down
the
statement
and
added
i
should
wonder
if
he
was
silly
enough
to
think
you
were
envious
of
him
for
having
so
many
friends
and
being
liked
by
all
sorts
of
people
envious
of
him
i
who
on
earth
has
been
putting
such
ideas
into
your
head
cried
mahony
it
was
thought
so
it
was
while
i
was
still
there
stammered
polly
still
more
fluttered
by
the
fact
of
him
fastening
on
just
these
words
mahony
tried
to
quell
his
irritation
by
fidgeting
round
the
room
surely
polly
you
might
give
up
calling
that
woman
now
you
belong
to
me
i
thank
you
for
the
relationship
he
said
testily
and
having
with
much
unnecessary
ado
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
he
went
on
it
bad
enough
to
say
things
of
that
kind
but
to
repeat
them
love
is
in
even
poorer
taste
yes
richard
said
polly
meekly
but
her
amazed
inner
query
was
not
even
to
one
own
husband
she
hung
her
head
till
the
white
thread
of
parting
between
the
dark
loops
of
her
hair
was
almost
perpendicular
she
had
spoken
without
thinking
in
the
first
place
had
just
blurted
out
a
passing
thought
but
even
when
forced
to
explain
she
had
never
dreamt
of
richard
taking
offence
rather
she
had
imagined
the
two
of
them
two
banded
lovingly
against
one
making
merry
together
over
purdy
nonsense
she
had
heard
her
husband
laugh
away
much
unkinder
remarks
than
this
and
perhaps
if
she
had
stopped
there
and
said
no
more
it
might
have
been
all
right
by
her
stupid
attempt
to
gloss
things
over
she
had
really
managed
to
hurt
him
and
had
made
him
think
her
gossipy
into
the
bargain
she
went
on
with
her
sewing
but
when
mahony
came
back
from
the
brisk
walk
by
means
of
which
he
got
rid
of
his
annoyance
he
fancied
though
polly
was
as
cheery
as
ever
and
had
supper
laid
for
him
that
her
eyelids
were
red
this
was
why
the
following
evening
he
promised
himself
to
be
discreet
winter
had
come
in
earnest
the
night
was
wild
and
cold
before
the
crackling
stove
the
cat
lay
stretched
at
full
length
while
pompey
dozed
fitfully
his
nose
between
his
paws
the
curtains
that
hung
at
the
little
window
gave
back
the
lamplight
in
a
ruddy
glow
the
clock
beat
off
the
seconds
evenly
except
when
drowned
by
the
wind
which
came
in
bouts
hurling
itself
against
the
corners
of
the
house
and
presently
laying
down
his
book
polly
was
too
busy
now
to
be
read
to
mahony
looked
across
at
his
wife
she
was
wrinkling
her
pretty
brows
over
the
manufacture
of
tiny
clothes
a
rather
pale
little
woman
still
none
of
the
initial
discomforts
of
her
condition
having
been
spared
her
feeling
his
eyes
on
her
she
looked
up
and
smiled
did
ever
anyone
see
such
a
ridiculous
armhole
three
of
one
fingers
were
enough
to
fill
it
and
she
held
the
little
shirt
aloft
for
his
inspection
here
was
his
chance
the
child
coming
offered
the
best
of
pretexts
taking
not
only
the
midget
garment
but
also
the
hand
that
held
it
he
told
her
of
his
resolve
to
go
back
to
england
and
his
profession
you
know
love
i
always
wished
to
get
home
again
and
now
an
additional
reason
i
do
want
my
our
children
to
grow
up
in
a
place
like
this
without
companions
or
refining
influences
who
knows
how
they
would
turn
out
he
said
it
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
his
children
would
be
safe
enough
and
polly
listening
to
him
made
the
same
reservation
yes
but
our
children
and
so
i
propose
as
soon
as
the
youngster
old
enough
to
travel
to
haul
down
the
flag
for
good
and
all
and
book
passages
for
the
three
of
us
in
some
smart
clipper
we
live
in
the
country
love
think
of
it
polly
a
little
gabled
house
at
the
foot
of
some
sussex
down
with
fruit
trees
and
a
high
hedge
round
it
and
only
the
peeping
over
does
it
make
your
mouth
water
my
dear
he
had
risen
in
his
eagerness
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
stove
his
legs
apart
and
polly
nodded
and
smiled
up
at
him
though
truth
to
tell
the
picture
he
drew
did
not
mean
much
to
her
she
had
never
been
in
sussex
nor
did
she
know
what
an
was
a
night
such
as
this
with
flying
clouds
and
a
shrill
piping
wind
made
her
think
of
angry
seas
and
a
dark
ship
cabin
in
which
she
lay
deathly
sick
but
it
was
not
polly
way
to
dwell
on
disagreeables
her
mind
glanced
off
to
a
pleasanter
theme
have
you
ever
thought
richard
how
strange
it
will
seem
when
there
are
three
of
us
you
and
i
will
never
be
quite
alone
together
again
oh
i
do
hope
he
will
be
a
good
baby
and
not
cry
much
it
will
worry
you
if
he
does
like
hempel
cough
and
then
you
wo
love
him
properly
i
shall
love
it
because
it
is
yours
my
darling
and
the
baby
of
such
a
dear
little
mother
is
sure
to
be
good
oh
babies
will
be
babies
you
know
said
polly
with
a
new
air
of
wisdom
which
sat
delightfully
on
her
mahony
pinched
her
cheek
mahony
you
shirking
my
question
tell
me
now
should
you
not
be
pleased
to
get
back
to
england
i
go
wherever
you
go
richard
said
polly
staunchly
always
and
of
course
i
should
like
to
see
mother
i
mean
my
real
mother
again
but
then
ned
here
and
john
and
sarah
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
leave
them
i
do
think
any
of
them
will
ever
go
home
now
they
may
be
here
but
they
do
trouble
you
often
my
dear
said
mahony
with
more
than
a
hint
of
impatience
especially
ned
the
who
lives
not
a
mile
from
your
door
i
know
he
does
often
come
to
see
us
richard
but
he
only
a
boy
and
has
to
work
so
hard
you
see
it
like
this
if
ned
should
get
into
any
trouble
i
here
to
look
after
him
and
i
know
that
makes
mind
easier
ned
was
always
her
favourite
and
an
extraordinary
thing
too
i
believe
it
the
boy
good
looks
that
blind
you
women
to
his
faults
oh
no
indeed
it
is
declared
polly
warmly
it
just
because
ned
ned
the
dearest
fellow
if
you
really
know
him
and
so
your
heart
anchored
here
little
wife
and
would
remain
here
even
if
i
carried
your
body
off
to
england
oh
no
richard
said
polly
again
my
heart
would
always
be
where
you
are
but
i
ca
help
wondering
how
ned
would
get
on
alone
and
jerry
will
soon
be
here
too
now
and
he
younger
still
and
how
i
should
like
to
see
dear
tilly
settled
before
i
go
judging
that
enough
had
been
said
for
the
time
being
mahony
his
book
leaving
his
wife
to
chew
the
cud
of
innocent
matchmaking
and
sisterly
cares
in
reality
polly
reflections
were
of
quite
another
nature
her
husband
abrupt
resolve
to
leave
the
colony
disturbing
though
it
was
did
not
take
her
altogether
by
surprise
she
would
have
needed
to
be
both
deaf
and
blind
not
to
notice
that
the
rang
much
seldomer
than
it
used
to
and
that
richard
had
more
spare
time
on
his
hands
yes
trade
was
dull
and
that
made
him
fidgety
now
she
had
always
known
that
someday
it
would
be
her
duty
to
follow
richard
to
england
but
she
had
imagined
that
day
to
be
very
far
off
when
they
were
elderly
people
and
had
saved
up
a
good
deal
of
money
to
hear
the
date
fixed
for
six
months
hence
was
something
of
a
shock
to
her
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
polly
had
a
sudden
inspiration
as
she
listened
to
richard
talking
of
resuming
his
profession
the
thought
flashed
through
her
mind
why
not
here
why
should
he
not
start
practice
in
ballarat
instead
of
travelling
all
those
thousands
of
miles
to
do
it
this
was
what
she
ruminated
while
she
tucked
and
hemmed
she
could
imagine
of
course
what
his
answer
would
be
he
would
say
there
were
too
many
doctors
on
ballarat
already
not
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
made
satisfactory
incomes
but
this
argument
did
not
convince
polly
richard
was
perhaps
a
great
success
at
storekeeping
but
that
was
only
because
he
was
too
good
for
it
as
a
doctor
he
with
his
cleverness
and
gentlemanly
manners
would
soon
she
was
certain
stand
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
and
then
there
would
be
money
galore
it
was
true
he
did
not
care
for
ballarat
was
down
on
both
place
and
people
but
this
objection
too
polly
waived
it
passed
belief
that
anybody
could
really
dislike
this
big
rich
bustling
township
where
such
handsome
buildings
were
springing
up
and
every
one
was
so
friendly
in
her
heart
she
ascribed
her
husband
want
of
love
for
it
to
the
infra
dig
position
he
occupied
if
he
mixed
with
his
equals
again
and
got
rid
of
the
feeling
that
he
was
looked
down
on
it
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
him
he
would
then
be
out
of
reach
of
snubs
and
slights
and
people
would
understand
him
better
not
the
residents
on
ballarat
alone
but
also
john
and
sarah
and
the
beamishes
none
of
whom
really
appreciated
richard
in
her
mind
eye
polly
had
a
vision
of
him
going
his
rounds
mounted
on
a
chestnut
horse
dressed
in
surtout
and
choker
and
hand
and
glove
with
the
bigwigs
of
society
the
gentlemen
at
the
camp
the
police
magistrate
and
archdeacon
long
the
rich
squatters
who
lived
at
the
foot
of
mount
buninyong
it
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheeks
merely
to
think
of
it
she
did
not
however
breathe
a
word
of
this
to
richard
she
was
a
shade
wiser
than
the
night
before
when
she
had
vexed
him
by
blurting
out
her
thoughts
and
the
present
was
not
the
right
time
to
speak
in
these
days
richard
was
under
the
impression
that
she
needed
to
be
humoured
he
might
agree
with
her
against
his
better
judgment
or
worse
still
pretend
to
agree
and
polly
did
want
that
she
wished
fairly
to
persuade
him
that
by
setting
up
here
on
the
diggings
where
he
was
known
and
respected
he
would
get
on
quicker
and
make
more
money
than
if
he
buried
himself
in
some
poky
english
village
where
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
him
meanwhile
the
unconscious
centre
of
her
ambitions
wore
a
perplexed
frown
mahony
was
much
exercised
just
now
over
the
question
of
medical
attendance
for
polly
the
thought
of
coming
into
personal
contact
with
a
member
of
the
fraternity
was
distasteful
to
him
none
of
them
had
an
inkling
who
or
what
he
was
and
though
piqued
by
their
unsuspectingness
he
at
the
same
time
feared
lest
it
should
not
be
absolute
and
he
have
the
to
hit
on
a
practitioner
who
had
heard
of
his
stray
spurts
of
doctoring
and
written
him
down
a
charlatan
and
a
quack
for
this
reason
he
would
call
in
no
one
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
even
the
western
township
seemed
too
near
ultimately
his
choice
fell
on
a
man
named
rogers
who
hailed
from
mount
pleasant
the
rise
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
and
some
two
miles
off
it
was
true
since
he
did
not
intend
to
disclose
his
own
standing
the
distance
would
make
the
fellow
fees
mount
up
but
rogers
was
at
least
properly
qualified
half
those
claiming
the
title
of
physician
were
impudent
impostors
who
did
know
a
diploma
from
the
ten
commandments
of
the
same
alma
mater
as
himself
not
a
contemporary
though
he
took
good
care
of
that
and
if
report
spoke
true
a
skilful
and
careful
obstetrician
when
however
in
response
to
a
note
carried
by
long
jim
rogers
drew
rein
in
front
of
the
store
mahony
was
not
greatly
impressed
by
him
he
proved
to
be
a
stout
reddish
man
some
ten
years
mahony
senior
with
a
face
and
an
undecided
manner
there
he
sat
his
ten
spread
meeting
and
gently
tapping
one
another
across
his
paunch
and
nodding
just
so
just
so
to
all
he
heard
he
had
the
trick
of
saying
everything
twice
over
needs
to
clinch
his
own
opinion
was
mahony
swift
diagnosis
himself
he
kept
in
the
background
and
was
he
forced
to
come
forward
his
manner
was
both
stiff
and
forbidding
so
on
tenterhooks
was
he
lest
the
other
should
presume
to
treat
him
as
anything
but
the
storekeeper
he
gave
himself
out
to
be
a
day
or
so
later
who
but
the
wife
must
arrive
to
visit
polly
a
piece
of
gratuitous
friendliness
that
could
well
have
been
dispensed
with
even
though
mahony
felt
it
keenly
that
at
this
juncture
polly
should
lack
companions
of
her
own
sex
but
rogers
had
married
beneath
him
and
the
sight
of
the
pursy
upstart
there
were
people
on
the
flat
who
remembered
her
running
barefoot
and
slatternly
sitting
there
in
satin
and
feathers
lording
it
over
his
own
little
jenny
wren
was
more
than
mahony
could
tolerate
the
distance
was
put
forward
as
an
excuse
for
polly
not
returning
the
call
and
polly
was
docile
as
usual
though
for
her
part
she
had
thought
her
visitor
quite
a
pleasant
kindly
woman
but
then
polly
never
knew
when
she
was
being
patronised
to
wipe
out
any
little
trace
of
disappointment
her
husband
suggested
that
she
should
write
and
ask
one
of
the
beamish
girls
to
stay
with
her
it
would
keep
her
from
feeling
the
days
long
but
polly
only
laughed
long
when
i
have
so
much
sewing
to
do
no
she
did
not
want
company
by
now
indeed
she
regretted
having
sent
off
that
impulsive
invitation
to
beamish
for
the
end
of
the
year
puzzle
as
she
would
she
could
not
see
how
she
was
going
to
put
mother
comfortably
up
meanwhile
the
rains
were
changing
the
familiar
aspect
of
the
place
creeks
in
summer
dry
gutters
of
baked
clay
were
now
rich
red
rivers
and
the
yellow
yarrowee
ran
full
to
the
brim
keeping
those
who
lived
hard
by
it
in
a
twitter
of
anxiety
the
steep
slopes
of
black
hill
showed
thinly
green
the
roads
were
ploughed
troughs
of
sticky
mire
occasional
night
frosts
whitened
the
ground
bringing
cloudless
days
in
their
wake
then
down
came
the
rain
once
more
and
fell
for
a
week
on
end
the
diggers
were
washed
out
of
their
holes
the
flat
became
an
untraversable
bog
and
now
there
were
floods
in
earnest
the
creeks
turned
to
foaming
torrents
that
swept
away
trees
and
the
old
roots
of
trees
and
the
dwellers
on
the
river
banks
had
to
fly
for
their
bare
lives
over
the
top
of
book
or
newspaper
mahony
watched
his
wife
stitch
stitch
stitch
with
a
zeal
that
never
flagged
at
the
dolly
garments
just
as
he
could
read
his
way
so
polly
sewed
hers
through
the
time
of
waiting
but
whereas
she
like
a
sensible
little
woman
pinned
her
thoughts
fast
to
the
matter
in
hand
he
let
his
range
freely
over
the
future
of
the
many
good
things
this
had
in
store
for
him
one
in
particular
whetted
his
impatience
it
took
close
on
a
twelvemonth
out
here
to
get
hold
of
a
new
book
on
ballarat
not
even
a
existed
nor
were
there
more
than
a
couple
of
shops
in
melbourne
itself
that
could
be
relied
on
to
carry
out
your
order
you
perforce
fell
behind
in
the
race
remained
ignorant
of
what
was
being
said
and
done
in
science
letters
religious
controversy
in
the
great
world
overseas
to
this
day
he
did
know
whether
agassiz
had
or
had
not
been
appointed
to
the
chair
of
natural
history
in
edinburgh
or
whether
fresh
heresies
with
regard
to
the
creation
of
species
had
spoiled
his
chances
did
not
know
whether
hugh
miller
had
actually
gone
crazy
over
the
vestiges
or
even
if
those
syme
and
simpson
had
at
length
sheathed
their
swords
now
however
god
willing
he
would
before
very
long
be
back
in
the
thick
of
it
all
in
intimate
touch
with
the
doings
of
the
most
city
in
europe
and
new
books
and
pamphlets
would
come
into
his
possession
as
they
dropped
hot
from
the
press
chapter
v
and
then
one
morning
it
was
spring
now
and
piping
hot
at
noon
long
jim
brought
home
from
the
a
letter
for
polly
addressed
in
her
sister
sarah
sloping
hand
knowing
the
pleasure
it
would
give
her
mahony
carried
it
at
once
to
his
wife
and
polly
laid
aside
broom
and
duster
and
sat
down
to
read
but
he
was
hardly
out
of
the
room
when
a
startled
cry
drew
him
back
to
her
side
polly
had
hidden
her
face
and
was
shaken
by
sobs
as
he
could
not
get
her
to
speak
mahony
picked
up
the
letter
from
the
floor
and
read
it
for
himself
sarah
wrote
like
one
distracted
oh
my
dear
sister
how
can
i
find
words
to
tell
you
of
the
truly
awful
calamity
that
has
befallen
our
unhappy
brother
mahony
skipped
the
phrases
and
learnt
that
owing
to
a
carriage
accident
emma
turnham
had
been
prematurely
confined
and
the
best
medical
aid
notwithstanding
john
spared
absolutely
no
expense
had
died
two
days
later
john
is
like
a
madman
directly
i
heard
the
shocking
news
i
at
once
threw
up
my
engagement
at
serious
loss
to
myself
but
that
is
a
matter
of
small
consequence
and
came
to
take
my
place
beside
our
poor
dear
brother
in
his
great
trial
but
all
my
efforts
to
bring
him
to
a
proper
and
christian
frame
of
mind
have
been
fruitless
i
am
indeed
alarmed
to
be
alone
with
him
and
i
tremble
for
the
children
for
he
is
possessed
of
an
insane
hatred
for
the
sweet
little
loves
he
has
locked
himself
in
his
room
will
see
no
one
nor
touch
a
particle
of
nourishment
do
my
dearest
polly
come
at
once
on
receipt
of
this
and
help
me
in
the
truly
awful
task
that
has
been
laid
upon
me
and
pray
forgive
me
for
using
this
plain
paper
i
have
had
literally
no
time
to
order
mourning
of
any
kind
so
that
was
sarah
with
a
click
of
the
tongue
mahony
tossed
the
letter
on
the
table
and
made
it
clear
to
polly
that
under
no
consideration
would
he
allow
her
to
attempt
the
journey
to
town
her
relatives
seemed
utterly
to
have
forgotten
her
condition
if
they
had
ever
grasped
the
fact
that
she
was
expecting
a
child
but
polly
did
not
heed
him
oh
poor
poor
emma
oh
poor
dear
john
her
husband
could
only
soothe
her
by
promising
to
go
to
assistance
himself
the
following
day
they
had
been
entirely
in
the
dark
about
things
for
john
turnham
thought
proper
to
erect
a
jealous
wall
about
his
family
life
what
went
on
behind
it
was
nobody
business
but
his
own
you
felt
yourself
were
meant
to
feel
yourself
the
alien
the
outsider
and
mahony
marvelled
once
more
at
the
wealth
of
love
and
sympathy
his
little
polly
had
kept
fresh
for
these
two
who
had
wasted
so
few
of
their
thoughts
on
her
polly
dried
her
eyes
he
packed
his
he
did
this
with
a
good
deal
of
pother
pulling
open
the
wrong
drawers
tumbling
up
their
contents
and
generally
making
havoc
of
his
wife
arrangements
but
the
sight
of
his
clumsiness
acted
as
a
kind
of
tonic
on
polly
she
liked
to
feel
that
he
was
dependent
on
her
for
his
material
comfort
and
they
spoke
of
john
brief
married
life
he
loved
her
like
a
pagan
my
dear
said
mahony
and
if
what
your
sister
sarah
writes
is
not
exaggerated
he
is
bearing
his
punishment
in
a
truly
pagan
way
but
you
wo
say
that
to
him
dear
richard
will
you
you
be
very
gentle
with
him
pleaded
polly
anxiously
indeed
i
shall
little
woman
but
one
ca
help
thinking
these
things
all
the
same
you
know
it
is
written
shalt
have
none
other
gods
but
me
yes
i
know
but
then
this
was
just
emma
and
she
was
so
pretty
and
so
good
and
polly
cried
anew
mahony
rose
before
dawn
to
catch
the
coach
together
with
a
packet
of
sandwiches
polly
brought
him
a
small
black
mantle
for
sarah
with
my
dear
love
you
see
richard
i
know
she
always
wears
coloured
dresses
and
she
will
feel
so
much
happier
if
she
has
something
black
to
put
on
little
polly
voice
was
deep
with
persuasion
richard
was
none
too
well
pleased
she
could
see
at
having
to
unlock
his
bag
again
she
feared
too
that
after
the
letter
of
the
day
before
his
opinion
of
sarah
had
gone
down
to
zero
mahony
secured
a
corner
seat
and
so
though
his
knees
interlocked
with
those
of
his
only
one
of
the
eight
inside
passengers
was
jammed
against
him
the
coach
started
and
the
long
dull
hours
of
the
journey
began
to
wear
away
nothing
broke
the
monotony
but
speculations
whether
the
driver
a
noted
tippler
would
be
drunk
before
melbourne
was
reached
and
capsize
them
and
the
drawling
voice
of
a
yankee
prospector
who
told
lying
tales
about
his
exploits
in
california
in
until
having
talked
his
hearers
to
sleep
he
dropped
off
himself
then
mahony
fell
to
reflecting
on
what
lay
before
him
he
did
like
the
job
he
was
not
one
of
your
born
good
samaritans
he
relished
intruding
as
little
as
being
intruded
on
besides
morally
to
sustain
to
forbear
with
a
in
misfortune
seemed
to
him
as
difficult
and
thankless
a
task
as
any
required
of
one
infinite
tact
was
essential
and
a
skin
thick
enough
to
stand
snubs
and
rebuffs
but
here
he
smiled
or
my
little
wife
inability
to
recognise
them
house
and
garden
had
lost
their
air
of
smartness
the
gate
stood
ajar
the
gravel
was
unraked
the
black
with
footmarks
with
all
the
blinds
still
down
the
windows
looked
like
so
many
dead
eyes
mahony
first
knock
brought
no
response
at
his
second
the
door
was
opened
by
sarah
turnham
herself
but
a
very
different
sarah
this
from
the
elegant
and
sprightly
young
person
who
had
graced
his
wedding
her
chignon
was
loose
her
dress
dishevelled
on
recognising
mahony
she
uttered
a
cry
and
fell
on
his
neck
he
had
to
disengage
her
arms
by
force
and
speak
severely
to
her
declaring
that
he
would
go
away
again
if
she
carried
out
her
intention
of
swooning
at
last
he
got
her
round
so
far
that
she
could
tell
her
tale
which
she
did
with
a
hysterical
overstatement
she
had
it
seemed
arrived
there
just
before
her
died
john
was
quarrelling
furiously
with
all
three
doctors
and
before
the
end
insulted
the
only
one
who
was
left
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
too
marched
out
of
the
house
they
had
to
get
the
dead
woman
measured
coffined
and
taken
away
by
stealth
whereupon
john
had
locked
himself
up
in
his
room
and
had
not
been
seen
since
he
had
a
loaded
revolver
with
him
through
the
closed
door
he
had
threatened
to
shoot
both
her
and
the
children
the
servants
had
deserted
at
their
master
behaviour
at
the
sudden
collapse
of
the
household
the
last
a
sent
out
on
an
errand
some
hours
previously
had
not
returned
sarah
was
at
her
wits
end
to
know
what
to
do
with
the
children
he
might
hear
them
screaming
at
this
moment
mahony
in
no
hesitancy
now
how
to
deal
with
the
situation
laid
his
hat
aside
and
drew
off
his
gloves
prepare
some
food
he
said
briefly
a
glass
of
port
and
a
sandwich
or
two
if
you
can
manage
nothing
else
but
meat
of
some
kind
but
there
was
not
a
morsel
of
meat
in
the
house
then
go
to
the
butcher
and
buy
some
sarah
gasped
and
bridled
she
had
never
in
her
life
been
inside
a
butcher
shop
good
god
woman
then
the
sooner
you
make
the
beginning
the
better
cried
mahony
and
as
he
strode
down
the
passage
to
the
door
she
indicated
he
added
now
control
yourself
madam
and
if
you
have
not
got
what
i
want
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
time
i
walk
out
of
the
house
and
leave
you
to
your
own
devices
at
which
sarah
cowed
and
shaken
began
tremblingly
to
tie
her
mahony
knocked
three
times
at
the
door
of
john
turnham
room
each
time
more
loudly
then
he
took
to
battering
with
his
fist
on
the
panels
and
cried
it
is
i
john
your
have
the
goodness
to
unlock
this
door
at
once
there
was
still
an
instant
of
suspense
then
heavy
footsteps
crossed
the
floor
and
the
door
swung
back
mahony
eyes
met
a
haggard
white
face
set
in
a
dusky
background
you
said
john
in
a
slow
dazed
way
and
blinked
at
the
light
but
in
the
next
breath
he
burst
out
where
that
damned
fool
of
a
woman
is
she
skulking
behind
you
i
wo
see
her
wo
have
her
near
me
if
you
mean
your
sister
sarah
she
is
not
in
the
house
at
present
said
mahony
and
stepping
over
the
threshold
he
shut
the
door
the
two
men
faced
each
other
in
the
twilight
what
do
you
want
demanded
john
in
a
hoarse
voice
have
you
too
come
to
preach
and
sermonise
if
so
you
can
go
back
where
you
came
from
i
have
none
of
that
cant
here
no
no
i
leave
that
to
those
whose
business
it
is
i
here
as
your
doctor
and
mahony
drew
up
a
blind
and
opened
a
window
instantly
the
level
flooded
the
room
and
the
air
that
came
in
with
them
smacked
of
the
sea
just
outside
the
window
a
in
full
blossom
reared
extravagant
masses
of
pink
snow
against
the
blue
overhead
beyond
it
a
covered
walk
of
vines
shone
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
to
turn
back
to
the
musty
room
from
all
this
lush
and
lovely
life
was
like
stepping
down
into
a
vault
john
had
sunk
into
a
seat
before
a
secretaire
and
shielded
his
eyes
from
the
sun
a
candle
stood
at
his
elbow
and
in
a
line
before
him
were
ranged
such
images
as
remained
to
him
of
his
dead
a
dozen
or
more
daguerrotypes
of
various
sizes
emma
and
he
before
marriage
and
after
marriage
emma
with
her
first
babe
at
different
stages
of
its
growth
emma
with
the
two
children
emma
in
with
a
hat
on
holding
a
book
the
sight
gave
the
quietus
to
mahony
scruples
stooping
he
laid
his
hand
on
john
shoulder
my
poor
fellow
he
said
gently
your
sister
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
travel
so
i
have
come
in
her
place
to
tell
you
how
deeply
how
truly
we
feel
for
you
in
your
loss
i
want
to
try
too
to
help
you
to
bear
it
for
it
has
to
be
borne
john
at
this
the
torrent
burst
leaping
to
his
feet
john
began
to
fling
wildly
to
and
fro
and
then
for
a
time
the
noise
of
his
lamentations
filled
the
room
mahony
had
assisted
at
scenes
of
this
kind
before
but
never
had
he
heard
the
like
of
the
blasphemies
that
poured
over
lips
afterwards
when
he
had
recovered
his
distance
he
would
refer
to
it
as
the
occasion
on
which
john
took
the
almighty
to
task
for
having
dared
to
interfere
in
his
private
life
at
the
moment
he
sat
silent
better
for
him
to
get
it
out
he
thought
to
himself
even
while
he
winced
at
john
scurrility
when
through
sheer
exhaustion
john
came
to
a
stop
mahony
cast
about
for
words
of
consolation
all
reference
to
the
mystery
of
god
way
was
precluded
and
he
shrank
from
entering
that
sound
plea
for
the
working
of
time
which
drives
a
spike
into
the
heart
of
the
mourner
he
bethought
himself
of
the
children
remember
she
did
not
leave
you
comfortless
you
have
your
little
ones
think
of
them
but
this
was
a
false
move
like
a
belated
thunderclap
after
the
storm
is
over
john
broke
out
again
his
haggard
eyes
aflame
curse
the
children
he
cried
thickly
curse
them
i
say
if
i
had
once
caught
sight
of
them
since
she
she
went
i
should
have
wrung
their
necks
i
never
wanted
children
they
came
between
us
they
took
her
from
me
it
was
a
child
that
killed
her
now
she
is
gone
and
they
are
left
keep
them
out
of
my
way
mahony
do
let
them
near
oh
emma
wife
and
here
his
shoulders
heaved
under
dry
harsh
sobs
mahony
felt
his
own
eyes
grow
moist
listen
to
me
john
i
promise
you
you
shall
not
see
your
children
again
until
you
wish
to
till
you
glad
to
recall
them
as
a
living
gift
from
her
you
have
lost
i
look
after
them
for
you
you
will
god
bless
you
mahony
judging
the
moment
ripe
mahony
rose
and
went
out
to
fetch
the
tray
on
which
sarah
had
set
the
eatables
the
meat
was
but
a
chop
charred
on
one
side
raw
on
the
other
but
john
did
not
notice
its
shortcomings
he
fell
on
it
like
the
starving
man
he
was
and
gulped
down
two
or
three
glasses
of
port
the
colour
returned
to
his
face
he
was
able
to
give
an
account
of
his
wife
last
hours
and
to
talk
is
what
he
needs
even
if
he
goes
on
till
morning
mahony
was
quick
to
see
that
there
were
things
that
rankled
in
john
memory
like
festers
in
flesh
one
was
that
knowing
the
greys
were
tricky
he
had
not
forbidden
them
to
emma
long
ago
but
he
had
felt
proud
of
her
skill
in
handling
the
reins
of
the
attention
she
attracted
far
from
thwarting
her
he
had
actually
urged
her
on
her
fall
had
been
a
light
one
and
at
the
outset
no
bad
results
were
anticipated
a
slight
haemorrhage
was
soon
got
under
control
a
week
later
however
it
began
anew
more
violently
and
then
all
remedies
were
in
vain
as
it
became
clear
that
the
child
was
dead
the
doctors
had
recourse
to
serious
measures
but
the
bleeding
went
on
she
complained
of
a
roaring
in
her
ears
her
extremities
grew
cold
her
pulse
fluttered
to
nothing
she
passed
from
syncope
to
coma
and
from
coma
to
death
john
swore
that
two
of
the
doctors
had
been
the
worse
for
drink
the
third
was
one
of
those
ignorant
impostors
with
whom
the
place
swarmed
and
again
he
made
himself
reproaches
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
look
for
someone
else
but
she
was
dying
i
could
not
tear
myself
mahony
i
can
still
see
her
they
had
stretched
her
across
the
bed
so
that
her
head
hung
over
the
side
her
hair
swept
the
floor
one
scoundrel
trod
on
it
trod
on
her
hair
and
i
had
to
stand
by
and
watch
while
they
butchered
her
butchered
my
oh
there
are
things
mahony
one
can
not
dwell
on
and
live
you
must
not
look
at
it
like
that
yet
when
i
recall
some
of
the
cases
i
seen
contraction
induced
in
ah
yes
if
you
had
been
here
my
god
if
only
you
had
been
here
but
mahony
did
not
encourage
this
idea
it
was
his
duty
to
unhitch
john
thoughts
from
the
past
he
now
suggested
that
the
children
and
sarah
safe
in
his
keeping
john
should
shut
up
the
house
and
go
away
to
his
surprise
john
jumped
at
the
proposal
was
ready
there
and
then
to
put
it
into
effect
yes
said
he
he
would
start
the
very
next
morning
and
with
no
more
than
a
blanket
on
his
back
would
wander
a
hundred
odd
miles
into
the
bush
sleeping
out
under
the
stars
at
night
and
day
by
day
increasing
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
scene
of
his
loss
and
now
up
he
sprang
in
a
sudden
fury
to
be
gone
warning
sarah
into
the
background
mahony
helped
him
get
together
a
few
necessaries
and
then
walked
him
to
a
hotel
here
he
left
him
sleeping
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
and
next
day
saw
him
off
on
his
tramp
northwards
over
the
great
divide
john
farewell
words
were
take
the
keys
of
the
house
with
you
and
do
give
them
up
to
me
under
a
month
at
least
that
day
coach
was
full
they
had
to
wait
for
seats
till
the
following
afternoon
the
delay
was
not
unwelcome
to
mahony
it
gave
polly
time
to
get
the
letter
he
had
written
her
the
night
before
after
leaving
john
he
set
about
raising
money
for
the
extra
fares
and
other
unforeseen
expenses
at
the
eleventh
hour
sarah
informed
him
that
their
young
brother
jerry
had
landed
in
melbourne
during
illness
and
had
been
hastily
boarded
out
knowing
no
one
else
in
the
city
mahony
was
forced
much
as
it
went
against
the
grain
to
turn
to
henry
ocock
for
assistance
and
he
was
effusively
received
ocock
tried
to
press
double
the
sum
needed
on
him
fortune
was
no
doubt
smiling
on
the
lawyer
his
offices
had
swelled
to
four
rooms
with
appropriate
clerks
in
each
he
still
however
nursed
the
scheme
of
transferring
his
business
to
ballarat
as
soon
that
is
as
i
can
hear
of
suitable
premises
i
understand
there
only
one
locality
to
be
considered
and
that
the
western
township
on
which
mahony
whose
address
was
in
the
outer
darkness
repeated
his
thanks
and
withdrew
he
found
jerry
lodging
paid
the
bill
and
took
the
boy
back
to
kilda
a
shy
slip
of
a
lad
in
his
early
teens
with
the
colouring
and
complexion
that
ran
in
the
family
john
coachman
who
had
shown
himself
not
indisposed
for
a
substantial
sum
paid
in
advance
to
keep
watch
over
house
and
grounds
was
installed
in
an
outbuilding
and
next
day
at
noon
after
personally
aiding
sarah
who
was
all
at
the
prospect
of
the
bush
journey
to
pack
her
own
and
the
clothes
mahony
turned
the
key
in
the
door
of
the
darkened
house
but
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
it
had
been
a
proud
and
happy
home
now
it
had
no
more
virtue
left
in
it
than
a
crab
empty
shell
he
had
fumed
on
first
learning
of
jerry
superfluous
presence
but
before
they
had
gone
far
he
saw
that
he
would
have
fared
ill
indeed
had
jerry
not
been
there
sarah
too
agitated
that
morning
to
touch
a
bite
of
food
was
seized
not
an
hour
out
with
sickness
and
fainting
there
she
sat
her
eyes
closed
her
salts
to
her
nose
or
feebly
sipping
brandy
unable
to
lift
a
finger
to
help
with
the
children
the
younger
of
the
two
slept
most
of
the
way
hotly
and
heavily
on
mahony
knee
but
the
boy
a
regular
pest
was
never
for
a
moment
still
in
vain
did
his
youthful
uncle
pinch
his
leg
each
time
he
wriggled
to
the
floor
it
was
not
till
a
digger
opposite
took
out
a
and
threatened
to
saw
off
both
his
feet
if
he
stirred
again
to
cut
out
his
tongue
if
he
put
another
question
that
scarlet
with
fear
little
johnny
was
tamed
altogether
it
was
a
nightmare
of
a
journey
and
mahony
groaned
with
relief
when
lamps
having
for
some
time
twinkled
past
the
coach
drew
up
and
hempel
and
long
jim
stepped
forward
with
their
lanterns
sarah
could
hardly
stand
the
children
wrathful
at
being
wakened
from
their
sleep
kicked
and
screamed
chapter
vi
for
the
first
time
in
her
young
married
life
polly
felt
vexed
with
her
husband
oh
he
should
have
done
that
no
really
he
should
she
murmured
and
the
hand
with
the
letter
in
it
drooped
to
her
lap
she
had
been
doing
a
little
surreptitious
baking
in
richard
absence
and
without
a
doubt
was
hot
and
tired
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
deserting
her
she
retreated
behind
the
woodstack
and
sat
down
on
the
and
then
for
some
minutes
the
sky
was
blotted
out
she
felt
quite
unequal
in
her
present
condition
to
facing
sarah
who
was
so
sensitive
so
easily
shocked
and
she
was
deeply
averse
from
her
sister
discovering
the
straitness
of
richard
means
and
home
but
it
was
hard
for
polly
to
secure
a
moment
privacy
an
so
this
is
you
is
it
said
long
jim
snappishly
he
had
been
opening
a
keg
of
treacle
and
held
a
sticky
plug
in
his
hand
an
me
runnin
my
pore
ol
legs
off
arter
you
and
hempel
met
her
on
her
entry
with
no
further
bad
news
i
and
trust
hempel
always
retained
his
smooth
servility
of
manner
the
shopman
par
excellence
my
dear
richard
was
used
to
say
of
him
polly
reassured
her
attendants
blew
her
nose
her
letter
and
other
feelings
came
uppermost
she
noticed
how
scribbly
the
writing
was
richard
had
evidently
been
hard
pushed
for
time
there
was
an
apologetic
tone
about
it
too
which
was
unlike
him
he
was
probably
wondering
what
she
would
say
he
might
even
be
making
himself
reproaches
it
was
unkind
of
her
to
add
to
them
let
her
think
rather
of
the
sad
state
poor
john
had
been
found
in
and
of
his
two
motherless
babes
as
for
sarah
it
would
never
have
done
to
leave
her
out
wiping
her
eyes
polly
untied
her
and
set
to
reviewing
her
resources
sarah
would
have
to
share
her
bed
richard
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
the
children
and
here
she
knitted
her
brows
then
going
into
the
yard
she
called
to
tom
ocock
who
sat
whittling
a
stick
in
front
of
his
father
house
and
tom
went
down
to
main
street
for
her
and
bought
a
mattress
which
he
carried
home
on
his
shoulder
this
she
spread
on
the
bedroom
floor
hemmerde
having
already
given
both
rooms
a
sound
scouring
just
in
case
a
flea
or
a
spider
should
be
lying
perdu
after
which
polly
fell
to
baking
again
in
good
earnest
for
the
travellers
would
be
famished
by
the
time
they
arrived
towards
ten
tom
who
was
on
the
shouted
that
the
coach
was
in
and
polly
her
table
spread
a
good
fire
going
stepped
to
the
door
outwardly
very
brave
inwardly
all
directly
however
she
got
sight
of
the
forlorn
party
that
toiled
up
the
slope
sarah
clinging
to
hempel
arm
mahony
bearing
one
heavy
child
and
could
she
believe
her
eyes
jerry
staggering
under
the
other
her
bashfulness
was
gone
she
ran
forward
to
prop
poor
sarah
on
her
free
side
to
guide
her
feet
to
the
door
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
little
polly
had
ever
spent
a
more
satisfying
hour
than
that
which
followed
her
husband
watching
her
in
silent
amaze
believed
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
fuss
and
commotion
there
was
sarah
too
sick
to
see
anything
but
the
bed
to
undress
to
make
fomentations
for
to
coax
to
mouthfuls
of
tea
and
toast
there
was
jerry
to
feed
and
send
off
with
the
warmest
of
hugs
to
share
tom
ocock
palliasse
there
were
the
children
well
polly
first
plan
had
been
to
put
them
straight
to
bed
but
when
she
came
to
peel
off
their
little
trousers
she
changed
her
mind
i
think
hemmerde
if
you
get
me
a
tub
of
hot
water
just
pop
them
into
it
they
sleep
so
much
better
she
said
not
quite
truthfully
her
private
reflection
was
i
do
think
sarah
can
once
have
washed
them
properly
all
that
time
the
little
girl
let
herself
be
bathed
in
her
sleep
but
young
john
stood
and
bawled
digging
fat
fists
into
slits
of
eyes
while
polly
scrubbed
at
his
massy
knees
the
dimpled
ups
and
downs
of
which
looked
as
if
they
had
been
worked
in
by
hand
she
had
never
seen
her
children
before
and
was
as
heartily
lost
in
admiration
of
their
plump
bodies
as
her
helper
of
the
costliness
of
their
outfit
real
injun
muslin
as
i
alive
ejaculated
the
woman
on
fishing
out
their
an
wid
the
sassiest
lace
for
trimmin
och
the
poor
little
motherless
angels
stan
quiet
you
young
divil
you
lem
me
button
you
up
clean
as
the
pair
were
laid
on
the
at
least
they
ca
fall
out
said
polly
surveying
her
work
with
a
sigh
of
content
every
one
else
having
retired
she
sat
with
richard
before
the
fire
waiting
for
his
to
reach
the
boil
he
was
anxious
to
know
just
how
she
had
fared
in
his
absence
she
to
hear
the
full
story
of
his
mission
he
confessed
to
her
that
his
offer
to
load
himself
up
with
the
whole
party
had
been
made
in
a
momentary
burst
of
feeling
afterwards
he
had
repented
his
impulsiveness
on
your
account
love
though
when
i
see
how
well
you
managed
you
dear
clever
little
woman
and
polly
consoled
him
being
now
come
honestly
to
the
stage
of
but
richard
what
else
could
you
do
what
indeed
i
knew
emma
had
no
relatives
in
melbourne
and
who
john
intimates
might
be
i
had
no
more
idea
than
the
man
in
the
moon
john
has
any
friends
he
never
had
as
for
leaving
the
children
in
sarah
charge
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
my
dear
i
consider
your
sister
sarah
the
biggest
goose
of
a
female
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
run
across
ah
but
you
do
really
know
sarah
yet
said
polly
and
smiled
a
little
through
the
tears
that
had
ripen
to
her
eyes
at
the
tale
of
john
despair
what
mahony
did
not
mention
to
her
was
the
necessity
he
had
been
under
of
borrowing
money
though
polly
was
aware
he
had
left
home
with
but
a
modest
sum
in
his
purse
he
wished
to
spare
her
feelings
polly
had
a
curious
delicacy
he
might
almost
call
it
a
manly
delicacy
with
regard
to
money
and
the
fact
that
john
had
not
offered
to
put
hand
to
pocket
let
alone
liberally
flung
a
blank
cheque
at
his
head
would
mahony
knew
touch
his
wife
on
a
tender
spot
nor
did
polly
herself
ask
questions
richard
made
no
allusion
to
john
having
volunteered
to
bear
expenses
so
the
latter
had
evidently
not
done
so
what
a
pity
richard
was
so
particular
himself
in
matters
of
this
kind
that
he
might
write
her
brother
down
close
and
stingy
of
course
john
distressed
state
of
mind
partly
served
to
excuse
him
but
she
could
not
imagine
the
calamity
that
would
cause
richard
to
forget
his
obligations
she
slid
her
hand
into
her
husband
and
they
sat
for
a
while
in
silence
then
half
to
herself
and
out
of
a
very
different
train
of
thought
she
said
just
fancy
them
never
crying
once
for
their
mother
talking
of
friends
said
sarah
and
fastidiously
cleared
her
throat
talking
of
friends
i
wonder
now
what
has
become
of
one
of
those
young
gentlemen
i
met
at
your
wedding
he
was
let
me
see
why
i
declare
if
i
have
forgotten
his
name
oh
i
know
who
you
mean
besides
there
was
only
one
sarah
mahony
heard
his
wife
reply
and
therewith
fall
into
her
sister
trap
you
mean
purdy
purdy
smith
who
was
richard
best
man
smith
echoed
sarah
la
polly
why
do
he
make
it
smythe
it
was
a
warm
evening
some
three
weeks
later
the
store
was
closed
to
customers
but
mahony
had
ensconced
himself
in
a
corner
of
it
with
a
book
since
the
invasion
this
was
the
one
place
in
which
he
could
make
sure
of
finding
quiet
the
sisters
sat
on
the
before
the
house
and
without
seeing
them
mahony
knew
to
a
nicety
how
they
were
employed
polly
darned
stockings
for
john
children
sarah
was
tatting
with
her
little
finger
stuck
out
at
right
angles
to
the
rest
mahony
could
hardly
think
of
this
finger
without
irritation
it
seemed
to
sum
up
sarah
whole
outlook
on
life
meanwhile
polly
fresh
voice
went
on
relating
purdy
fortunes
he
took
part
you
know
in
the
dreadful
affair
on
the
eureka
last
christmas
when
so
many
poor
men
were
killed
we
can
speak
of
it
now
they
all
been
pardoned
but
then
we
had
to
be
very
careful
well
he
was
shot
in
the
ankle
and
will
always
be
lame
from
it
what
go
hobbling
on
one
leg
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
oh
my
dear
said
sarah
and
laughed
yes
because
the
wound
was
properly
attended
to
he
had
to
hide
about
in
the
bush
for
ever
so
long
later
on
he
went
to
the
beamishes
to
be
nursed
but
by
that
time
his
poor
leg
was
in
a
very
bad
state
you
know
he
is
engaged
or
very
nearly
so
to
tilly
beamish
what
said
sarah
once
more
that
handsome
young
fellow
engaged
to
one
of
those
vulgar
creatures
oh
sarah
not
really
vulgar
it
is
their
fault
they
did
have
a
better
education
they
lived
right
where
there
were
no
schools
tilly
never
saw
a
town
till
she
was
sixteen
but
she
can
sit
any
yes
we
hope
very
much
purdy
will
soon
settle
down
and
marry
her
though
he
left
the
hotel
again
without
proposing
and
polly
sighed
there
he
shows
his
good
taste
my
dear
oh
i
sure
he
fond
of
tilly
it
only
that
his
life
is
so
unsettled
he
been
a
barman
at
euroa
since
then
and
the
last
we
heard
of
him
he
was
shearing
somewhere
on
the
goulburn
he
seem
able
to
stick
to
anything
and
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
gave
back
sarah
sententiously
and
in
fancy
mahony
saw
the
nod
with
which
she
accompanied
the
words
here
hempel
passed
through
the
store
clad
in
his
sunday
best
his
hair
plastered
flat
with
going
out
for
a
stroll
asked
his
master
that
was
my
sir
i
do
think
you
find
i
left
any
of
my
dooties
undone
oh
go
by
all
means
said
mahony
curtly
nettled
at
having
his
harmless
query
misconstrued
it
pointed
a
suspicion
he
had
had
of
late
that
a
change
was
coming
over
hempel
the
model
employee
was
a
shade
less
prompt
than
heretofore
to
fly
at
his
word
and
once
or
twice
seemed
actually
to
be
studying
his
own
convenience
without
knowing
what
the
matter
was
mahony
felt
it
politic
not
to
be
even
mildly
to
conciliate
his
assistant
it
would
put
him
in
an
awkward
fix
now
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
winding
up
affairs
should
hempel
take
it
in
his
head
to
leave
him
in
the
lurch
the
lean
figure
moved
on
and
blocked
the
doorway
now
there
was
a
sudden
babble
of
cheepy
voices
and
simultaneously
sarah
cried
where
have
you
been
my
little
cherubs
come
to
your
aunt
and
let
her
kiss
you
but
the
children
who
had
frankly
no
great
liking
for
aunt
sarah
would
mahony
knew
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
this
display
of
opportunism
and
make
a
rush
for
his
wife
laying
down
his
book
he
ran
out
polly
cautious
it
all
right
richard
i
being
careful
polly
had
let
her
mending
fall
and
with
each
hand
held
a
child
at
arm
length
johnny
dirty
boy
what
have
you
been
up
to
he
played
he
was
a
digger
and
sat
down
in
a
pool
i
could
get
him
to
budge
answered
jerry
and
drew
his
sleeve
over
his
perspiring
forehead
oh
fy
for
shame
don
care
said
john
unabashed
don
tare
echoed
his
sister
who
existed
but
as
his
shadow
was
made
to
care
was
hung
quoted
aunt
sarah
in
her
severest
copybook
tones
turning
his
head
in
his
aunt
direction
young
john
thrust
forth
a
bright
pink
tongue
little
emma
was
not
behindhand
polly
jumped
up
dropping
her
work
to
the
ground
johnny
i
shall
punish
you
if
ever
i
see
you
do
that
again
now
ellen
shall
put
you
to
bed
instead
of
auntie
ellen
was
hemmerde
eldest
and
first
regular
maidservant
don
care
repeated
johnny
ellen
plays
pillers
edn
pays
pidders
said
the
echo
seizing
two
hot
pudgy
hands
polly
dragged
the
pair
indoors
though
they
held
back
mainly
on
principle
they
were
not
affectionate
children
they
were
too
strong
of
will
and
set
of
purpose
for
that
but
if
they
had
a
fondness
for
anyone
it
was
for
their
aunt
polly
she
was
ruler
over
a
drawerful
of
and
though
she
scolded
she
never
slapped
while
this
was
going
on
hempel
stood
the
picture
of
indecision
and
eased
now
one
foot
now
the
other
as
if
his
boots
pinched
him
at
length
he
blurted
out
i
was
wondering
ahem
miss
turnham
if
since
it
is
an
agreeable
you
would
care
to
take
a
walk
to
that
i
told
you
of
me
take
a
walk
la
no
whatever
put
such
an
idea
as
that
into
your
head
cried
sarah
and
tatted
and
tatted
keeping
time
with
a
pretty
little
foot
i
thought
said
hempel
meekly
i
did
make
your
thoughts
hempel
retorted
sarah
laying
stress
on
the
aspirate
oh
no
i
i
did
presume
to
suggest
such
a
thing
and
with
a
hangdog
air
hempel
prepared
to
slink
away
well
well
said
sarah
double
quick
and
ceasing
to
jerk
her
in
and
out
she
nimbly
rolled
up
her
ball
of
thread
since
you
so
insistent
and
since
mind
you
there
no
society
worth
calling
such
on
these
diggings
the
truth
was
sarah
saw
that
she
was
about
to
be
left
alone
with
mahony
jerry
had
sauntered
off
to
meet
ned
and
this
was
by
no
means
to
her
mind
she
still
bore
her
a
grudge
for
his
treatment
of
her
at
the
time
of
john
bereavement
as
if
i
had
been
one
of
the
domestics
my
dear
a
paid
domestic
ordered
me
off
to
the
butcher
in
language
that
fairly
shocked
me
mahony
turned
his
back
and
strolled
down
to
the
river
he
did
not
know
which
was
more
painful
to
witness
hempel
unmanly
cringing
or
the
air
of
fatuous
satisfaction
that
succeeded
it
when
he
returned
the
pair
was
just
setting
out
he
watched
sarah
on
hempel
arm
picking
short
steps
in
dainty
as
soon
as
they
were
well
away
he
called
to
polly
the
coast
clear
come
for
a
stroll
polly
emerged
tying
her
why
where
sarah
oh
i
see
oh
richard
i
hope
she
did
put
on
that
she
did
my
dear
said
mahony
grimly
and
tucked
his
wife
hand
under
his
arm
oh
how
i
wish
she
would
said
polly
in
a
tone
of
concern
she
does
get
so
stared
at
especially
of
an
evening
when
there
are
so
many
rude
men
about
but
i
really
do
think
she
minds
for
she
has
a
bonnet
in
her
box
all
the
time
miss
sarah
was
giving
ballarat
food
for
talk
by
appearing
on
her
promenades
in
a
hat
a
large
flat
mushroom
hat
i
trust
my
little
woman
will
never
put
such
a
ridiculous
object
on
her
head
no
never
at
least
not
unless
they
become
quite
the
fashion
answered
polly
and
i
do
think
they
will
they
look
too
odd
another
thing
love
continued
mahony
on
whom
a
sudden
light
had
dawned
as
he
stood
listening
to
sarah
trumpery
i
fear
your
sister
is
trifling
with
the
feelings
of
our
worthy
hempel
polly
who
had
kept
her
own
counsel
on
this
matter
went
crimson
oh
do
you
really
think
so
richard
she
asked
evasively
i
hope
not
for
of
course
nothing
could
come
of
it
sarah
has
refused
the
most
eligible
offers
ah
but
there
are
none
here
to
refuse
and
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
poll
anything
in
trousers
seems
fish
to
her
net
on
one
of
their
pacings
they
found
ocock
come
out
to
smoke
an
evening
pipe
the
old
man
had
just
returned
from
a
flying
visit
to
melbourne
he
looked
glum
and
careworn
but
livened
up
at
the
sight
of
polly
and
cracked
one
of
the
mouldy
jokes
he
believed
beneficial
to
a
young
woman
in
her
condition
still
the
in
his
mood
was
melancholy
and
this
although
his
dearest
wish
was
on
the
point
of
being
fulfilled
yes
i
got
the
very
crib
for
at
last
billy
de
la
poer
top
o
lydiard
street
we
sol
poor
billy
up
yesterday
the
third
smash
in
two
days
that
makes
lord
i
dunno
where
it
end
things
are
going
a
bit
quick
over
there
there
been
too
much
building
they
at
me
to
build
too
is
but
i
says
no
this
place
is
good
enough
for
me
if
goin
to
be
ashamed
of
father
lives
better
stop
away
i
an
ol
man
now
an
a
poor
one
what
should
i
want
with
a
fine
noo
an
should
i
build
it
for
even
if
i
the
tin
for
them
two
in
there
not
if
i
know
it
ocock
you
would
believe
how
kind
and
clever
tom
been
at
helping
with
the
children
said
polly
warmly
yes
an
at
and
sweepin
and
cookin
a
pasty
but
a
female
do
it
just
as
well
returned
tom
father
with
a
snort
of
contempt
poor
old
chap
said
mahony
as
they
passed
out
of
earshot
so
even
the
great
henry
arrival
is
not
to
be
without
its
drop
of
gall
surely
he
never
be
ashamed
of
his
father
who
knows
but
it
plain
he
suspects
the
old
boy
has
made
his
pile
and
intends
him
to
fork
out
said
mahony
carelessly
and
with
this
dismissed
the
subject
now
that
his
own
days
in
the
colony
were
numbered
he
no
longer
felt
constrained
to
pump
up
a
spurious
interest
in
local
affairs
he
consigned
them
wholesale
to
that
limbo
in
which
for
him
they
had
always
belonged
the
two
brothers
came
striding
over
the
slope
ned
clad
in
blue
serge
shirt
and
corduroys
laid
an
affectionate
arm
round
polly
shoulder
and
tossed
his
hat
into
the
air
on
hearing
that
the
salamander
as
he
called
sarah
was
not
at
home
for
i
tons
to
tell
you
poll
old
girl
and
when
milady
sits
there
turning
up
her
nose
at
everything
a
chap
says
somehow
the
spunk
goes
out
of
one
polly
had
baked
a
large
cake
for
her
darling
and
served
out
generous
slices
then
drawing
up
a
chair
she
sat
down
beside
him
to
drink
in
his
news
from
his
place
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
mahony
studied
the
trio
these
three
young
faces
which
were
so
much
alike
that
they
might
have
been
different
readings
of
one
and
the
same
face
polly
by
reason
of
her
woman
lot
looked
considerably
the
oldest
still
the
lamplight
wiped
out
some
of
the
shadows
and
she
was
never
more
girlishly
vivacious
than
with
ned
entering
as
she
did
with
zest
into
his
plans
and
ideas
more
sister
now
than
wife
and
ned
showed
at
his
best
with
polly
he
laid
himself
out
to
divert
her
forgot
to
brag
or
to
swear
and
so
natural
did
it
seem
for
brother
to
open
his
heart
to
sister
that
even
his
egoistic
chatter
passed
muster
as
for
young
jerry
who
in
a
couple
of
days
was
to
begin
work
in
the
same
claim
as
ned
he
sat
his
thoughts
writ
large
on
his
forehead
mahony
translated
them
thus
how
in
the
world
i
could
ever
have
sat
prim
and
proper
on
the
when
all
this
change
adventure
romance
was
awaiting
me
jerry
was
only
mahony
knew
to
push
a
wheelbarrow
from
hole
to
water
and
back
again
for
many
a
week
to
come
but
for
him
it
would
certainly
be
a
golden
barrow
and
laden
with
gold
so
greatly
had
ned
tales
fired
his
imagination
the
onlooker
felt
odd
man
out
debarred
as
he
was
by
his
profounder
experience
from
sharing
in
the
young
people
dreams
he
took
up
his
book
but
his
reading
was
cut
into
by
ned
sprightly
account
of
the
magpie
rush
by
his
description
of
an
engine
at
work
on
the
eureka
and
of
the
wooden
airpipes
that
were
being
used
to
ventilate
there
was
nothing
ned
did
not
know
and
could
not
make
entertaining
one
was
forced
almost
against
one
will
to
listen
to
him
and
on
this
particular
evening
when
he
was
neither
sponging
nor
acting
the
big
gun
mahony
toned
down
his
first
sweeping
judgment
of
his
young
relative
ned
was
all
talk
and
what
impressed
one
so
unfavourably
his
grumbling
his
extravagant
boastfulness
was
the
mere
thistledown
of
the
moment
puffed
off
into
space
it
mattered
little
that
he
harped
continually
on
chucking
up
his
job
two
years
had
passed
since
he
came
to
ballarat
and
he
was
still
working
for
hire
in
somebody
else
hole
he
still
groaned
over
the
hardships
of
the
life
and
still
toiled
on
and
all
the
rest
was
just
the
froth
and
braggadocio
of
aimless
youth
chapter
vii
not
hours
later
sarah
had
an
accident
to
her
machoire
and
returned
to
melbourne
a
most
opportune
breakage
said
mahony
and
laughed
that
day
at
the
he
had
given
his
a
piece
of
his
mind
sarah
had
always
resented
the
name
bestowed
on
her
by
her
parents
and
was
at
present
engaged
in
altering
it
in
giving
it
so
to
speak
a
foreign
tang
henceforth
she
was
to
be
not
sarah
but
sara
spoken
sahra
as
often
as
polly
tongue
tripped
over
the
unfamiliar
syllable
sara
gently
but
firmly
put
her
right
and
polly
corrected
herself
even
begged
pardon
for
her
stupidity
till
mahony
could
bear
it
no
longer
throwing
politeness
to
the
winds
he
twitted
sara
with
her
finical
affectations
her
ways
the
morning
sloth
that
expected
polly
in
her
delicate
state
of
health
to
carry
a
to
the
bedside
cast
up
at
her
in
short
all
that
had
made
him
champ
and
fret
in
silence
sara
might
after
a
fitting
period
of
the
huff
have
overlooked
the
rest
but
the
she
could
not
forgive
and
directly
dinner
was
over
the
mishap
to
her
mouthpiece
was
made
known
too
much
in
awe
of
mahony
to
stand
up
to
him
for
when
he
was
angry
he
was
very
angry
sara
retaliated
by
abusing
him
to
polly
as
she
packed
her
trunk
manners
indeed
to
turn
and
insult
a
visitor
at
his
own
table
and
who
and
what
is
he
i
should
like
to
know
to
speak
to
me
so
nothing
but
a
common
storekeeper
my
dear
you
have
my
deepest
sympathy
it
a
dreadful
life
for
you
of
course
you
keep
everything
as
nice
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
but
the
surroundings
polly
and
the
store
and
the
want
of
society
i
could
put
up
with
it
not
for
a
week
polly
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
and
feeling
very
cast
down
at
sara
unfriendly
departure
shed
a
few
tears
at
this
for
part
of
what
her
sister
said
was
true
it
had
been
wrong
of
richard
to
be
rude
to
sara
while
the
latter
was
a
guest
in
his
house
but
she
defended
him
warmly
i
could
be
happier
than
i
am
richard
the
best
husband
in
the
world
as
for
his
being
common
sara
you
know
he
comes
of
a
much
better
family
than
we
do
my
dear
common
is
as
common
does
and
a
vulgar
calling
ends
by
vulgarising
those
who
have
the
misfortune
to
pursue
it
but
another
reason
polly
why
it
is
better
for
me
to
leave
you
there
are
certain
circumstances
my
dear
in
which
to
put
it
mildly
it
is
awkward
for
two
people
of
opposite
sexes
to
go
on
living
under
the
same
roof
sarah
i
mean
sara
do
you
really
mean
to
say
hempel
has
made
you
a
proposal
cried
polly
in
her
tears
i
wo
say
my
dear
that
he
has
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
actually
offer
marriage
but
he
has
let
me
see
only
too
plainly
what
his
feelings
are
of
course
i
kept
him
in
his
place
the
preposterous
creature
but
all
the
same
it
not
comme
il
faut
any
longer
for
me
to
be
here
did
she
say
where
she
was
going
or
what
she
intended
to
do
mahony
inquired
of
his
wife
that
night
as
she
bound
the
strings
of
her
nightcap
no
she
had
polly
admitted
rather
out
of
countenance
but
then
sara
was
like
that
very
close
about
her
own
affairs
i
think
perhaps
gone
back
to
her
last
situation
she
had
several
letters
while
she
was
here
in
that
lady
hand
people
are
always
glad
to
get
her
back
not
many
finishing
governesses
can
teach
all
she
can
and
polly
checked
off
sara
attainments
on
the
fingers
of
both
hands
she
go
anywhere
under
two
hundred
a
year
a
most
accomplished
person
your
sister
said
mahony
sleepily
still
it
very
pleasant
to
be
by
ourselves
again
eh
wife
an
even
more
blessed
peace
shortly
descended
on
the
house
for
the
time
was
now
come
to
get
rid
of
the
children
as
well
since
nothing
had
been
heard
of
john
they
were
to
be
boarded
out
over
polly
illness
through
the
butcher
lady
arrangements
were
made
with
a
wife
who
lived
outside
the
racket
and
dust
of
the
township
and
had
a
whole
posse
of
little
ones
of
her
bless
you
more
would
make
any
difference
to
me
there
the
paddock
for
to
run
wild
in
this
was
the
best
that
could
be
done
for
the
children
polly
packed
their
little
kit
dealt
out
a
parting
bribe
of
and
saw
them
hoisted
into
the
dray
that
would
pass
the
door
of
their
destination
once
more
husband
and
wife
sat
alone
together
as
in
the
days
before
john
domestic
catastrophe
and
now
mahony
said
tentatively
you
think
love
we
could
manage
to
get
on
without
that
old
beamish
woman
i
guarantee
to
nurse
you
as
well
as
any
female
alive
the
question
did
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
polly
she
had
already
put
it
to
herself
after
the
affair
with
sara
she
awaited
her
new
visitor
in
fear
and
trembling
sara
had
at
least
stood
in
awe
of
richard
and
held
her
tongue
before
him
beamish
prided
herself
on
being
afraid
of
nobody
and
on
always
speaking
her
mind
and
yet
even
while
agreeing
that
it
would
be
well
to
put
mother
off
polly
drooped
her
wings
at
a
time
like
this
a
woman
was
a
woman
it
seemed
as
if
even
the
best
of
husbands
did
not
quite
understand
just
give
her
the
hint
we
do
want
her
said
mahony
airily
but
mother
was
not
the
person
to
take
a
hint
no
matter
how
broad
it
was
necessary
to
be
blunt
to
the
point
of
rudeness
and
polly
spent
a
difficult
hour
over
the
composition
of
her
letter
she
might
have
saved
her
pains
beamish
replied
that
she
knew
her
darling
little
polly
unwillingness
to
give
trouble
but
it
was
not
likely
she
would
now
go
back
on
her
word
she
had
been
packed
and
ready
to
start
for
the
past
week
polly
handed
the
letter
to
her
husband
and
did
not
say
what
she
thought
she
read
out
of
it
namely
that
mother
who
so
seldom
could
be
spared
from
home
was
looking
forward
with
pleasure
to
her
trip
to
ballarat
i
suppose
it
a
case
of
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
sighed
mahony
and
having
one
day
drawn
beamish
at
melting
point
from
the
inside
of
a
crowded
coach
he
loaded
long
jim
with
her
bags
and
bundles
his
aversion
was
not
lightened
by
his
subsequently
coming
on
his
wife
in
the
act
of
unpacking
a
hamper
which
contained
half
a
ham
a
stone
jar
of
butter
some
loaves
of
bread
a
bag
of
vegetables
and
a
plum
pudding
good
god
does
the
woman
think
we
ca
give
her
enough
to
eat
he
asked
testily
he
had
all
the
poor
distrust
of
a
gift
she
means
it
kindly
dear
she
probably
thought
things
were
still
scarce
here
and
she
knew
i
would
be
able
to
do
much
cooking
pleaded
polly
and
going
out
to
the
kitchen
she
untied
the
last
parcel
in
which
was
a
big
round
cheese
by
stealth
she
had
pulled
beamish
over
the
threshold
had
got
her
into
the
bedroom
and
shut
the
door
before
any
of
the
ohs
and
ahs
she
saw
painted
on
the
broad
rubicund
face
could
be
transformed
into
words
and
hugs
and
kisses
over
she
bravely
seized
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
begged
her
guest
not
to
criticise
house
or
furnishings
in
front
of
richard
it
took
beamish
a
minute
or
two
to
grasp
her
meaning
then
she
said
heartily
there
there
my
duck
do
you
worry
i
be
as
mum
as
mum
and
in
a
whisper
so
got
a
temper
polly
but
this
i
will
say
if
i
known
this
was
all
to
you
said
stop
you
are
my
lamb
in
a
comfortable
oh
i
am
happy
mother
dear
indeed
i
am
cried
polly
i
never
regretted
being
married
never
once
there
there
now
and
it
only
i
mean
this
is
the
best
we
can
afford
in
the
meantime
and
if
i
am
satisfied
floundered
polly
dismayed
to
hear
her
words
construed
into
blame
of
her
husband
it
only
that
it
upsets
richard
if
people
speak
slightingly
of
our
house
and
that
upsets
me
and
i
mus
be
worried
just
now
you
know
she
added
with
a
somewhat
shaky
smile
not
a
word
will
i
say
ducky
make
yer
pore
little
mind
easy
about
that
though
such
a
poky
little
of
a
place
i
never
was
in
and
while
tying
her
beamish
swept
the
little
bedroom
and
its
sloping
roof
with
a
withering
glance
i
was
girls
simply
she
related
the
incident
to
her
daughters
an
i
up
an
told
so
just
like
me
you
know
not
room
enough
to
swing
a
cat
in
and
sittin
at
the
of
the
table
as
mighty
as
a
dook
you
can
thank
yer
stars
you
two
did
take
one
o
you
instead
o
polly
but
this
was
chiefly
by
way
of
a
for
tilly
and
jinny
an
now
my
dear
tell
me
everything
with
these
words
beamish
spread
her
skirts
and
settled
down
to
a
cosy
chat
on
the
subject
of
polly
hopes
but
like
the
majority
of
her
sex
she
was
an
adept
at
dividing
her
attention
and
while
making
delicate
inquiries
of
the
young
wife
she
was
also
travelling
her
shrewd
eye
round
the
little
bedchamber
spying
out
and
appraising
not
one
of
poor
polly
makeshifts
escaped
her
the
result
of
her
inspection
was
to
cause
her
to
feel
justly
indignant
with
mahony
the
idea
him
to
rob
them
of
polly
just
to
dump
her
down
in
a
place
like
this
she
would
never
be
able
to
resist
telling
him
what
she
thought
of
him
here
however
she
reckoned
without
polly
polly
was
sharp
enough
to
doubt
mother
ability
to
hold
her
tongue
and
saw
to
it
that
richard
and
she
were
not
left
alone
together
and
of
an
evening
when
talk
languished
she
would
beg
her
husband
to
read
to
them
from
the
ballarat
star
until
as
often
as
not
beamish
fell
asleep
frequently
too
she
persuaded
him
to
go
out
and
take
a
hand
in
a
newlyformed
whist
club
or
discuss
politics
with
a
neighbour
mahony
went
willingly
enough
his
home
was
less
home
than
ever
since
the
big
woman
intrusion
even
his
food
lost
its
savour
beamish
had
taken
over
the
cooking
and
she
went
about
it
with
an
air
that
implied
he
had
not
had
a
decent
bite
to
eat
since
his
marriage
there
what
do
you
say
to
that
now
that
something
like
a
pudding
and
a
great
was
planked
triumphantly
down
in
the
middle
of
the
lor
polly
your
bit
of
a
kitchen
in
this
weather
i
fair
dished
and
the
good
woman
mopped
her
streaming
face
and
could
herself
eat
nothing
mahony
much
preferred
his
wife
cooking
which
took
account
of
his
tastes
it
was
done
too
without
any
fuss
and
he
persisted
in
upholding
polly
skill
in
face
of
beamish
disbelief
polly
on
edge
lest
he
should
openly
state
his
preference
nervously
held
out
her
plate
it
so
good
mother
i
must
have
a
second
helping
she
declared
and
then
without
appetite
in
the
cruel
midday
heat
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
solid
slab
of
pudding
pompey
and
palmerston
got
into
the
way
of
sitting
very
close
to
her
chair
she
confided
to
richard
that
beamish
disapproved
of
his
evening
outings
many
an
takes
to
goin
out
at
such
a
time
my
dear
an
never
gets
back
the
of
stoppin
at
so
just
you
be
careful
ducky
this
was
a
standing
joke
between
them
mahony
would
wink
at
polly
when
he
put
his
hat
on
and
wear
it
rakishly
askew
however
he
quite
enjoyed
a
crack
with
the
postmaster
or
the
at
this
juncture
colonial
politics
were
more
interesting
than
usual
the
new
constitution
had
been
proclaimed
and
a
valiant
effort
was
being
made
to
form
a
cabinet
to
induce
that
was
a
sufficient
number
of
men
to
give
up
time
to
the
service
of
their
country
it
looked
as
if
the
attempt
were
going
to
fail
just
as
on
the
goldfields
the
local
courts
by
which
since
the
stockade
the
diggers
governed
themselves
were
failing
because
none
could
afford
to
spend
his
days
sitting
in
them
yet
however
high
the
discussion
ran
he
kept
one
ear
turned
towards
his
home
here
things
were
at
a
standstill
polly
time
had
come
and
gone
but
there
was
no
end
set
to
their
suspense
it
was
blazing
hot
now
in
the
little
log
house
walls
and
roof
were
black
with
flies
mosquitoes
made
the
nights
hideous
even
polly
lost
patience
with
herself
when
morning
after
morning
she
got
up
feeling
as
well
as
ever
and
knowing
that
she
had
to
steer
through
another
difficult
day
it
was
not
the
suspense
alone
the
strain
of
keeping
the
peace
was
growing
too
much
for
her
oh
do
quarrel
with
her
richard
for
my
sake
she
begged
her
husband
one
night
she
means
so
well
and
she
ca
help
being
like
she
is
she
has
always
been
accustomed
to
order
beamish
about
but
i
wish
she
had
never
never
come
sobbed
poor
polly
and
mahony
in
a
sudden
flash
of
enlightenment
put
his
arms
round
her
and
made
humble
promises
not
another
word
should
cross
his
lips
though
i
like
nothing
so
well
as
to
throw
her
out
and
her
bags
and
bundles
after
her
come
laugh
a
little
my
polly
think
of
the
old
lady
flying
down
the
slope
with
her
packages
in
a
shower
about
her
head
rogers
looked
in
whenever
he
passed
at
this
stage
he
was
of
the
jocular
persuasion
still
an
unwelcome
visitor
no
little
tidbit
of
news
for
me
there
he
sat
twiddling
his
thumbs
reiterating
his
singsong
just
so
and
looking
wise
as
an
owl
mahony
knew
the
air
had
many
a
time
seen
it
donned
to
cloak
perplexity
and
covert
doubts
of
rogers
ability
began
to
assail
him
but
then
he
fell
mentally
foul
of
every
one
he
came
in
touch
with
at
present
ned
for
the
fashion
in
which
he
left
his
cheerfulness
on
the
beamish
for
the
eternal
pore
lamb
with
which
she
beplastered
polly
and
the
antiquated
she
embarrassed
them
by
consulting
however
this
state
of
things
could
not
last
for
ever
and
at
dawn
one
hot
january
day
polly
was
taken
ill
the
early
hours
promised
well
but
the
morning
wore
on
turned
to
midday
then
to
afternoon
and
matters
still
hung
fire
while
towards
six
the
patient
dismayed
them
by
sitting
up
in
bed
saying
she
felt
much
better
and
asking
for
a
cup
of
tea
this
drew
ah
my
pore
lamb
you
got
to
feel
worse
yet
afore
you
better
from
beamish
it
ended
in
rogers
taking
up
his
quarters
there
for
the
night
towards
eleven
mahony
and
he
sat
one
on
each
side
of
the
table
in
the
little
the
heat
was
insupportable
and
all
three
doors
and
the
window
were
propped
open
in
the
feeble
hope
of
creating
a
draught
the
lamp
had
attracted
a
swarm
of
flying
things
giant
moths
beat
their
wings
against
the
globe
or
fell
singed
and
sizzling
down
the
chimney
alighted
with
a
click
upon
the
table
blowflies
and
mosquitoes
kept
up
a
dizzy
hum
from
time
to
time
mahony
rose
and
stole
into
the
bedroom
where
beamish
sat
fanning
the
pests
off
polly
who
was
in
a
feverish
doze
leaning
over
his
wife
he
let
his
finger
lie
on
her
wrist
and
back
again
in
the
outer
room
he
bit
nervously
at
his
nail
an
old
trick
of
his
when
in
a
quandary
he
had
curtly
refused
a
game
of
bezique
so
rogers
had
produced
a
pack
of
cards
from
his
own
pocket
soiled
frayed
cards
which
had
likely
done
service
on
many
a
similar
occasion
and
was
whiling
the
time
away
with
solitaire
to
sit
there
watching
his
slow
manipulation
of
the
cards
his
patent
intentness
on
the
game
to
listen
any
longer
to
the
accursed
din
of
the
gnats
and
flies
passed
mahony
powers
of
endurance
abruptly
shoving
back
his
chair
he
went
out
into
the
yard
this
was
some
twenty
paces
across
from
the
row
of
old
that
constituted
his
past
shed
and
woodstack
to
the
fence
how
often
he
walked
it
he
did
not
know
but
when
he
went
indoors
again
his
boots
were
heavy
with
mud
for
a
brief
summer
storm
had
come
up
earlier
in
the
evening
a
dense
black
pall
of
cloud
had
swept
like
a
heavy
curtain
over
the
stars
to
the
tune
of
flash
and
bang
now
all
was
clear
and
calm
again
the
white
of
the
milky
way
powdered
the
sky
just
overhead
and
though
the
heat
was
still
intense
the
air
had
a
fragrant
smell
of
saturated
dust
and
earth
he
could
hear
streamlets
of
water
trickling
down
the
hillside
to
the
river
below
out
there
in
the
dark
several
things
became
plain
to
him
he
saw
that
he
had
not
had
any
real
confidence
in
rogers
from
the
start
while
the
effect
of
the
evening
spent
at
close
quarters
had
been
to
sink
his
opinion
to
nothing
rogers
belonged
to
an
old
school
his
method
was
to
sit
by
and
let
nature
take
its
course
perhaps
just
this
slowness
to
move
had
won
him
a
name
for
extreme
care
his
old
fogyism
showed
up
unmistakably
in
a
short
but
heated
argument
they
had
had
on
the
subject
of
chloroform
he
cited
such
hoary
objections
to
the
use
of
the
new
anaesthetic
in
maternity
cases
as
mahony
had
never
expected
to
hear
again
the
therapeutic
value
of
pain
the
moral
danger
the
patient
ran
in
yielding
up
her
will
what
right
have
we
to
bid
a
sacrifice
her
consciousness
and
the
impious
folly
of
interfering
with
the
action
of
a
creative
law
it
had
only
remained
for
him
to
quote
genesis
and
the
talking
serpent
had
the
case
been
in
his
own
hands
he
would
have
intervened
before
now
rogers
on
the
contrary
was
still
satisfied
with
the
shape
of
affairs
or
made
pretence
to
be
for
watching
mahony
fancied
each
time
the
fat
man
propelled
his
paunch
out
of
the
sickroom
it
was
a
shade
less
surely
there
were
nuances
too
in
the
way
he
pronounced
his
vapid
as
long
as
our
strength
is
well
maintained
well
maintained
mahony
doubted
polly
ability
to
bear
much
more
and
he
made
bold
to
know
his
own
wife
constitution
best
rogers
was
what
if
he
delayed
too
long
and
polly
slipped
through
his
hands
lose
polly
good
god
the
very
thought
turned
him
cold
and
alive
to
his
with
the
superstition
of
his
race
he
impetuously
offered
up
his
fondest
dream
to
those
invisible
powers
that
sat
aloft
waiting
to
be
appeased
if
this
was
to
be
the
price
exacted
of
him
the
price
of
his
escape
from
exile
then
then
to
come
back
to
the
present
however
he
was
in
an
awkward
position
he
was
going
to
be
forced
to
take
polly
case
out
of
the
hands
of
the
man
to
whom
he
had
entrusted
it
such
a
step
ran
counter
to
all
the
stiff
rules
of
conduct
the
punctilios
of
decorum
laid
down
by
the
most
profession
in
the
world
but
a
fresh
visit
to
polly
whose
pulse
had
grown
markedly
softer
put
an
end
to
his
scruples
stalking
into
the
he
said
without
preamble
in
my
opinion
any
further
delay
will
mean
a
risk
to
my
wife
i
request
you
to
operate
immediately
rogers
blinked
up
from
his
cards
surprise
writ
across
his
ruddy
countenance
he
pushed
his
spectacles
to
his
forehead
eh
what
well
well
yes
the
time
is
no
doubt
coming
when
we
shall
have
to
lend
mother
nature
a
hand
coming
it
come
and
gone
are
you
blind
man
rogers
had
faced
many
an
agitated
husband
in
his
day
now
now
mahony
he
said
soothingly
and
laid
his
last
two
cards
in
line
you
must
allow
me
to
be
the
judge
of
that
besides
he
added
as
he
took
off
his
glasses
to
polish
them
on
a
red
bandanna
besides
i
should
have
to
ask
you
to
go
out
and
get
some
one
to
assist
me
i
shall
assist
you
returned
mahony
rogers
smiled
his
broad
fat
smile
easier
said
than
done
my
good
sir
easier
said
than
done
mahony
considerately
turned
his
back
and
kept
it
turned
emptying
a
pitcher
of
water
into
a
basin
he
began
to
lather
his
hands
i
am
a
qualified
medical
man
of
the
same
university
as
yourself
i
studied
under
simpson
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
get
the
words
out
but
by
speaking
he
felt
that
he
did
ample
penance
for
the
fit
of
tetchy
pride
which
in
the
first
instance
had
tied
his
tongue
rogers
was
dumbfounded
well
upon
my
word
he
ejaculated
letting
his
hands
with
glasses
and
handkerchief
fall
to
the
table
god
bless
my
soul
why
could
you
say
so
before
and
why
the
deuce
did
you
yourself
attend
we
can
go
into
all
that
afterwards
but
rogers
was
not
one
of
those
who
could
deal
rapidly
with
the
unexpected
he
continued
to
vent
his
surprise
and
to
shoot
distrustful
glances
at
his
companion
he
was
flurried
too
at
being
driven
forward
quicker
than
he
had
a
mind
to
go
and
said
sulkily
that
mahony
must
take
full
responsibility
for
what
they
were
about
to
do
mahony
hardly
heard
him
he
was
looking
at
the
instruments
laid
out
on
the
table
his
fingers
itched
to
close
round
them
i
prepare
my
wife
he
said
briskly
and
going
into
the
bedroom
he
bent
over
the
pillow
it
was
damp
with
the
sweat
that
had
dripped
from
polly
head
when
the
pains
were
on
her
you
girl
get
in
quick
now
with
your
bucket
and
cloth
and
give
that
place
a
good
afore
that
pore
lamb
opens
eyes
again
i
cooked
that
what
i
am
and
sitting
heavily
down
on
the
beamish
wiped
her
face
towards
the
four
points
of
the
compass
piqued
by
an
unholy
curiosity
young
ellen
willingly
obeyed
but
a
minute
later
she
was
back
having
done
no
more
than
set
her
pail
down
inside
the
bedroom
door
oh
sure
beamish
and
i
ca
she
cried
shrilly
it
jus
like
andy
soakes
shop
when
bin
quarterin
a
sheep
i
quarter
you
you
lazy
trollop
you
cried
beamish
rising
to
her
aching
legs
again
and
her
anxiety
found
vent
in
a
hearty
burst
of
temper
i
teach
you
pulling
as
she
spoke
the
floorcloth
out
of
the
girl
hand
such
airs
and
graces
why
sooner
or
later
milady
you
got
to
go
through
it
yourself
me
catch
me
said
ellen
with
enormous
emphasis
mean
to
say
that
the
children
always
come
of
course
it
is
you
mincing
every
blessed
child
that
walks
and
i
just
said
beamish
as
she
marched
off
herself
with
brush
and
scrubber
i
now
you
know
it
you
a
little
more
love
and
gratitoode
for
your
own
mother
than
ever
you
before
oh
lor
said
the
girl
oh
lor
and
plumping
down
on
the
she
snatched
her
apron
to
her
face
and
began
to
cry
chapter
viii
two
months
passed
before
mahony
could
help
polly
and
beamish
into
the
coach
bound
for
geelong
it
had
been
touch
and
go
with
polly
and
for
weeks
her
condition
had
kept
him
anxious
with
the
inset
of
the
second
month
however
she
seemed
fairly
to
turn
the
corner
and
from
then
on
made
a
steady
recovery
thanks
to
her
youth
and
an
unimpaired
vitality
he
had
hurried
the
little
cradle
out
of
sight
but
polly
was
quick
to
miss
it
and
quite
approved
of
its
having
been
given
to
a
needy
expectant
mother
near
by
altogether
she
bore
the
thwarting
of
her
hopes
bravely
poor
little
baby
i
should
have
been
very
fond
of
it
was
all
she
said
when
she
was
well
enough
to
fold
and
pack
away
the
tiny
garments
at
which
she
had
stitched
with
such
pleasure
it
was
not
to
mahony
mind
that
she
returned
with
beamish
but
what
else
could
be
done
after
lying
a
prisoner
through
the
hot
summer
she
was
sadly
in
need
of
a
change
and
beamish
promised
her
a
diet
of
unlimited
milk
and
eggs
as
well
as
the
do
nothing
life
that
befitted
an
invalid
just
before
they
left
a
letter
arrived
from
john
demanding
the
keys
of
his
house
and
proposing
that
polly
should
come
to
town
to
set
it
in
order
for
him
and
help
him
to
engage
a
housekeeper
a
niggardly
a
truly
fashion
of
giving
an
invitation
thought
mahony
and
was
not
for
his
wife
accepting
it
but
polly
was
so
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
brother
that
he
ended
by
agreeing
to
her
going
on
to
melbourne
as
soon
as
she
had
thoroughly
recuperated
peace
between
him
and
beamish
was
dearly
bought
up
to
the
last
they
barely
avoided
a
final
explosion
at
the
beginning
of
her
third
month
absence
from
home
the
good
woman
grew
very
restive
and
sighed
aloud
for
the
day
on
which
she
would
be
able
to
take
her
departure
i
expec
my
bein
away
like
this
run
clean
into
a
note
she
said
one
evening
when
it
comes
to
managin
an
those
two
girls
of
mine
a
o
gumption
between
them
it
was
tactless
of
her
even
polly
felt
that
though
she
could
sympathise
with
the
worry
that
prompted
the
words
as
for
mahony
had
he
had
the
money
to
do
it
he
would
have
flung
the
sum
named
straight
at
her
head
she
must
never
come
again
said
polly
to
herself
as
she
bent
over
the
she
was
making
as
a
gift
for
john
it
is
a
pity
but
it
seems
as
if
richard
ca
get
on
with
those
sort
of
people
in
his
relief
at
having
his
house
to
himself
mahony
accepted
even
polly
absence
with
composure
to
be
perpetually
in
the
company
of
other
people
irked
him
beyond
belief
a
certain
amount
of
privacy
was
as
vital
to
him
as
sleep
delighting
in
his
solitude
he
put
off
from
day
to
day
the
disagreeable
job
of
winding
up
his
affairs
and
discovering
how
much
or
how
little
ready
money
there
would
be
to
set
sail
with
another
thing
some
books
he
had
sent
home
for
a
year
or
more
ago
came
to
hand
at
this
time
and
gave
him
a
fresh
pretext
for
delay
there
were
eight
or
nine
volumes
to
unpack
and
cut
the
pages
of
he
ran
from
one
to
another
sipping
devouring
finally
he
cast
anchor
in
a
collected
edition
of
his
old
chief
writings
on
obstetrics
slipped
in
this
as
a
gift
from
the
sender
a
college
chum
and
over
it
his
feet
on
the
table
his
dead
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
mahony
sat
for
the
better
part
of
the
night
the
effect
of
this
on
his
was
that
of
a
spark
on
tinder
under
the
flash
he
cursed
for
the
hundredth
time
the
folly
he
had
been
guilty
of
in
throwing
up
medicine
it
was
a
vocation
that
had
fitted
him
as
coursing
fits
a
hound
or
a
woman
the
only
excuse
he
could
find
for
his
apostasy
was
that
he
had
been
caught
in
an
epidemic
of
unrest
which
had
swept
through
the
country
upsetting
the
balance
of
men
reason
he
had
since
wondered
if
the
great
exhibition
of
had
not
had
something
to
do
with
it
by
unduly
whetting
imaginations
so
that
but
a
single
cry
of
gold
was
needed
to
loose
the
spirit
of
vagrancy
that
lurks
in
every
briton
blood
his
case
had
perhaps
been
peculiar
in
this
no
one
had
come
forward
to
warn
or
dissuade
his
next
relatives
mother
and
sisters
were
he
thought
glad
to
know
him
well
away
in
their
eyes
he
had
lowered
himself
by
taking
up
medicine
to
them
it
was
still
of
a
piece
with
barber
pole
and
before
his
time
no
member
of
the
family
had
entered
any
profession
but
the
army
oh
that
infernal
irish
pride
and
irish
poverty
it
had
his
youth
blighted
the
prospects
of
his
sisters
he
could
remember
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
jibes
and
fleers
called
forth
by
the
suit
of
a
wealthy
dublin
brewer
who
had
been
attracted
by
sheer
force
of
contrast
no
doubt
to
the
elder
of
the
two
miss
with
their
long
thin
noses
and
the
ingrained
lines
that
ran
from
the
curled
nostrils
to
the
corners
of
their
supercilious
mouths
describing
a
sneer
so
deep
that
at
a
distance
it
was
possible
to
mistake
it
for
a
smile
beer
my
dear
indeed
and
there
are
worse
things
in
the
world
than
beer
he
heard
his
mother
declare
in
her
biting
way
by
all
means
take
him
you
can
wash
yourself
in
it
if
water
gets
scarce
and
i
place
my
kitchen
orders
with
you
lucinda
who
had
perhaps
sniffed
timidly
at
release
burnt
crimson
thank
you
she
would
rather
eat
he
supposed
they
pinched
and
scraped
along
as
of
old
the
question
of
money
was
never
broached
between
him
and
them
prior
to
his
marriage
he
had
sent
them
what
he
could
but
that
little
was
in
itself
an
admission
of
failure
they
made
no
inquiries
about
his
mode
of
life
preferring
it
to
remain
in
shadow
enough
for
them
that
he
had
not
amassed
a
fortune
had
that
come
to
pass
they
might
have
pardoned
the
rude
method
of
its
making
in
fancy
he
listened
to
the
witty
cutting
words
in
which
they
would
have
alluded
to
his
success
lying
back
in
his
chair
he
thought
of
them
thus
without
unkindliness
even
with
a
dash
of
humour
that
was
possible
now
that
knocking
about
the
world
had
rubbed
off
some
of
his
own
corners
in
his
young
days
he
too
had
been
hot
and
bitter
what
however
to
another
might
have
formed
the
chief
crux
in
their
conduct
it
was
by
squandering
such
money
as
there
was
his
own
portion
among
it
on
his
scamp
of
an
elder
brother
that
they
had
forced
him
into
the
calling
they
despised
this
had
not
troubled
him
greatly
for
medicine
was
the
profession
on
which
his
choice
would
anyhow
have
fallen
and
the
book
that
lay
before
him
had
infected
him
with
the
old
enthusiasm
he
those
days
when
a
skilfully
handled
case
of
placenta
previa
or
a
successful
delivery
in
the
fourth
position
had
meant
more
to
him
than
the
charge
of
the
light
brigade
fresh
from
this
dip
into
the
past
this
foretaste
of
the
future
he
turned
in
good
heart
to
business
an
inventory
had
to
be
taken
damaged
goods
cleared
out
a
list
of
bad
and
less
bad
debts
drawn
up
he
and
hempel
were
hard
at
work
all
next
day
the
result
was
worse
even
than
he
had
expected
his
outlay
that
summer
ever
since
the
day
on
which
he
had
set
off
to
the
aid
of
his
bereaved
relative
had
been
enormous
trade
had
run
dry
and
throughout
polly
long
illness
he
had
dipped
blindly
into
his
savings
he
could
never
have
said
no
to
beamish
when
she
came
to
him
for
money
rather
would
he
have
pawned
the
coat
off
his
back
and
she
good
woman
was
unused
to
cheeseparing
his
men
wages
paid
berths
booked
the
numerous
expenses
bound
up
with
a
departure
defrayed
he
would
have
but
a
scanty
sum
in
hand
with
which
to
start
on
the
other
side
for
himself
he
was
not
afraid
but
he
shrank
from
the
thought
of
polly
undergoing
privations
so
far
they
had
enjoyed
a
kind
of
frugal
comfort
but
should
he
meet
with
obstacles
at
the
outset
if
patients
were
laggardly
and
the
practice
slow
to
move
or
if
he
himself
fell
ill
they
might
have
a
spell
of
real
poverty
to
face
and
it
was
under
the
goad
of
this
fear
that
he
hit
on
a
new
scheme
why
not
leave
polly
behind
for
a
time
until
he
had
succeeded
in
making
a
home
for
her
why
not
leave
her
under
the
wing
of
brother
john
john
stood
urgently
in
need
of
a
head
for
his
establishment
and
who
so
well
suited
for
the
post
as
polly
surely
if
it
were
put
before
him
john
must
jump
at
the
offer
parting
from
polly
and
were
it
only
for
a
little
while
would
be
painful
but
did
he
go
alone
he
would
be
free
to
do
his
utmost
and
with
an
easy
mind
knowing
that
she
lacked
none
of
the
yes
the
more
he
considered
the
plan
the
better
he
liked
it
the
one
flaw
in
his
satisfaction
was
the
thought
that
if
their
child
had
lived
no
such
smooth
and
simple
arrangement
would
have
been
possible
he
could
not
have
foisted
a
family
on
turnham
now
he
waited
with
impatience
for
polly
to
return
his
reasonable
little
polly
but
he
did
not
hurry
her
polly
was
enjoying
her
holiday
having
passed
to
melbourne
from
geelong
she
wrote
john
is
so
very
kind
he
does
of
course
go
out
yet
himself
but
i
was
present
with
some
friends
of
his
at
a
very
elegant
soiree
john
gave
me
a
headdress
composed
of
black
pearls
and
frosted
leaves
he
means
to
go
in
for
polities
as
soon
as
his
year
of
mourning
is
up
mahony
replied
enjoy
yourself
my
heart
and
set
all
the
sights
you
can
while
into
more
than
one
of
his
letters
he
slipped
a
banknote
for
you
know
i
like
you
to
pay
your
own
way
as
far
as
possible
and
at
length
the
day
came
when
he
could
lift
his
wife
out
of
the
coach
she
emerged
powdered
brown
with
dust
and
very
tired
but
radiantly
happy
it
was
a
great
event
in
little
polly
life
this
homecoming
and
coming
too
strong
and
well
the
house
was
a
lively
place
that
afternoon
polly
had
so
much
to
tell
that
she
sat
holding
her
bonnet
for
over
an
hour
quite
unable
to
get
as
far
as
the
bedroom
and
even
long
jim
mouth
went
up
at
the
corners
instead
of
down
for
polly
had
contrived
to
bring
back
a
little
gift
for
every
one
and
in
presenting
these
she
found
out
more
of
what
people
were
thinking
and
feeling
than
her
husband
had
done
in
all
the
eight
weeks
of
her
absence
mahony
was
loath
to
damp
her
pleasure
straightway
he
bided
his
time
he
could
not
know
that
polly
also
had
been
laying
plans
and
that
she
watched
anxiously
for
the
right
moment
to
unfold
them
the
morning
after
her
return
she
got
a
lift
in
the
baker
cart
and
drove
out
to
inspect
john
children
what
she
saw
and
heard
on
this
visit
was
disquieting
the
children
had
run
wild
were
grown
dirty
sly
untruthful
especially
the
a
young
satan
and
that
a
fact
mahony
what
he
needs
is
a
man
hand
over
him
and
a
good
hidin
six
days
outer
seven
it
was
not
alone
little
johnny
misconduct
however
that
made
polly
break
silence
an
incident
occurred
that
touched
her
still
more
nearly
husband
and
wife
sat
snug
and
quiet
as
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
autumn
had
come
round
and
a
fire
burnt
in
the
stove
before
which
pompey
snorted
in
his
dreams
but
for
all
the
cosy
tranquillity
polly
was
not
happy
and
time
and
again
she
moistened
and
bit
at
the
tip
of
her
thread
before
pointing
it
through
her
needle
for
the
book
open
before
richard
in
which
he
was
making
notes
as
he
read
was
the
bible
bending
over
him
to
drop
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
his
head
polly
had
been
staggered
by
what
she
saw
opposite
the
third
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
and
god
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
he
had
written
three
days
before
the
sun
her
heart
seemed
to
shrivel
to
grow
small
in
her
breast
at
the
thought
of
her
husband
being
guilty
of
such
impiety
ceasing
her
pretence
at
sewing
she
walked
out
of
the
house
into
the
yard
standing
there
under
the
stars
she
said
aloud
as
if
some
one
the
one
could
hear
her
he
does
mean
to
do
wrong
i
know
he
does
but
when
she
the
room
he
was
still
at
it
his
beautiful
writing
reduced
to
its
tiniest
wound
round
the
narrow
margins
deeply
red
polly
took
her
courage
in
both
hands
and
struck
a
blow
for
the
soul
whose
salvation
was
more
to
her
than
her
own
richard
do
you
think
that
is
is
right
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
mahony
raised
his
head
eh
what
pollykin
i
mean
do
you
think
you
ought
that
it
is
right
to
do
what
you
are
doing
the
smile
that
she
loved
broke
over
her
husband
face
he
held
out
his
hand
is
my
little
wife
troubled
richard
i
only
mean
polly
my
dear
do
worry
your
little
head
over
what
you
understand
and
have
confidence
in
me
you
know
i
would
do
anything
i
believed
to
be
wrong
yes
indeed
and
you
are
really
far
more
religious
than
i
am
one
can
be
religious
and
yet
not
shut
one
eyes
to
the
truth
saint
paul
you
know
who
says
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
and
you
may
depend
on
it
polly
the
would
never
have
given
us
the
brains
he
has
if
he
had
not
intended
us
to
use
them
now
i
have
long
felt
sure
that
the
bible
is
not
wholly
what
it
claims
to
be
direct
inspiration
oh
richard
said
polly
and
threw
an
anxious
glance
over
her
shoulder
if
anyone
should
hear
you
we
ca
afford
to
let
our
lives
be
governed
by
what
other
people
think
polly
nor
will
i
give
any
man
the
right
to
decide
for
me
what
my
share
of
the
truth
shall
be
on
seeing
the
bible
closed
polly
breathed
again
at
the
same
time
promising
herself
to
take
the
traitorous
volume
into
that
no
third
person
eye
should
rest
on
it
perhaps
too
if
it
were
put
away
richard
would
forget
to
go
on
writing
in
it
he
had
probably
begun
in
the
first
place
only
because
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
in
the
store
he
sat
and
smoked
and
twirled
his
thumbs
not
half
a
dozen
customers
came
in
in
the
course
of
the
day
if
he
were
once
properly
occupied
again
with
work
that
he
liked
he
would
not
be
tempted
to
put
his
gifts
to
such
a
profane
use
thus
she
primed
herself
for
speaking
for
now
was
the
time
richard
was
declaring
that
trade
had
gone
to
the
dogs
his
takings
dropped
to
a
quarter
of
what
they
had
formerly
been
this
headed
just
where
she
wished
but
polly
would
not
have
been
polly
had
she
not
glanced
aside
for
a
moment
to
cheer
and
console
it
the
same
everywhere
richard
everybody
complaining
and
that
reminds
me
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
the
beamishes
they
in
great
trouble
you
see
a
bog
has
formed
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
the
traffic
goes
round
another
way
so
they
lost
most
of
their
custom
beamish
never
opens
his
mouth
at
all
now
and
mother
is
fearfully
worried
that
what
was
the
matter
when
she
was
here
only
she
was
too
kind
to
say
so
hard
lines
indeed
it
is
but
about
us
i
not
surprised
to
hear
trade
is
dull
since
i
was
over
in
the
western
township
last
no
less
than
six
new
general
stores
have
gone
up
i
scarcely
knew
the
place
they
all
got
big
windows
and
were
crowded
with
people
yes
there
a
regular
exodus
up
west
but
that
does
alter
the
fact
wife
that
i
made
a
very
poor
job
of
storekeeping
i
shall
leave
here
with
hardly
a
penny
to
my
name
yes
but
then
richard
said
polly
and
bent
over
her
strip
of
needlework
you
were
never
cut
out
to
be
a
storekeeper
were
you
i
was
not
and
i
verily
believe
if
it
had
been
for
that
old
of
a
hempel
i
should
have
come
a
cropper
long
ago
yes
and
hempel
said
polly
softly
hempel
been
wanting
to
leave
for
ever
so
long
the
dickens
he
has
cried
mahony
in
astonishment
and
me
humming
and
hawing
about
giving
him
notice
what
the
matter
with
him
what
he
had
to
complain
of
oh
nothing
like
that
he
wants
to
enter
the
ministry
a
needed
at
the
baptist
chapel
and
he
means
to
apply
for
the
post
you
see
he
saved
a
good
deal
and
thinks
he
can
study
to
be
a
minister
at
the
same
time
study
for
his
grave
the
fool
so
that
it
is
it
well
well
it
saves
trouble
in
the
end
i
do
need
to
bother
my
head
now
over
what
to
become
of
him
him
or
anyone
else
my
chief
desire
is
to
say
to
this
hole
for
ever
there
no
sense
polly
in
my
dawdling
on
indeed
i
have
the
money
to
do
it
so
i
arranged
my
dear
with
our
friend
ocock
to
come
in
and
sell
us
off
as
soon
as
you
can
get
our
personal
belongings
put
together
here
polly
raised
her
head
as
if
to
interrupt
but
mahony
full
of
what
he
had
to
say
ignored
the
movement
and
went
on
speaking
he
did
not
wish
to
cause
his
wife
uneasiness
by
dwelling
on
his
difficulties
but
some
explanation
was
necessary
to
pave
the
way
for
his
proposal
that
she
should
remain
behind
when
he
left
the
colony
he
spent
all
his
eloquence
in
making
this
sound
natural
and
attractive
but
it
was
hard
when
polly
big
astonished
eyes
hung
on
his
face
do
you
think
for
my
sake
you
could
be
brave
enough
he
wound
up
rather
unsurely
it
would
be
for
long
love
i
certain
of
that
just
let
me
set
foot
in
england
once
more
why
why
yes
dear
richard
i
i
think
i
could
if
you
really
wished
it
said
polly
in
a
small
voice
she
tried
to
seem
reasonable
though
black
night
descended
on
her
at
the
thought
of
parting
and
though
her
woman
eyes
saw
a
hundred
objections
to
the
plan
which
his
had
overlooked
for
one
thing
john
had
just
installed
sara
as
housekeeper
and
sara
would
take
it
very
unkindly
to
be
shown
the
door
i
think
i
could
she
repeated
but
before
you
go
on
dear
i
should
like
to
ask
you
something
she
laid
down
her
needlework
her
heart
was
going
richard
did
you
ever
i
mean
have
you
never
thought
of
of
taking
up
your
profession
again
i
mean
here
starting
practice
here
no
wait
a
minute
let
me
finish
i
i
oh
richard
unable
to
find
words
polly
locked
her
fingers
under
the
tablecloth
and
hoped
she
was
not
going
to
be
so
silly
as
to
cry
getting
up
she
knelt
down
before
her
husband
laying
her
hands
on
his
knees
oh
richard
i
wish
you
would
how
i
wish
you
would
why
polly
said
mahony
surprised
at
her
agitation
why
my
dear
what
all
this
you
want
to
know
if
i
never
thought
of
setting
up
in
practice
out
here
of
course
i
did
in
the
beginning
you
think
i
have
chosen
to
keep
a
store
if
there
been
any
other
opening
for
me
but
there
was
child
the
place
was
overrun
never
a
medico
came
out
and
found
digging
too
much
for
him
but
he
fell
back
in
despair
on
his
profession
i
did
see
my
way
to
join
their
starvation
band
yes
then
richard
but
now
broke
in
polly
now
it
quite
quite
different
look
at
the
size
ballarat
has
grown
there
are
more
than
forty
thousand
people
settled
on
it
ocock
told
me
so
and
you
know
dear
doctors
have
cleared
out
lately
not
come
fresh
there
was
that
one
i
forget
his
name
who
drank
himself
to
death
and
the
two
you
remember
who
were
sold
up
just
before
christmas
but
this
was
an
unfortunate
line
of
argument
to
have
hit
on
and
polly
blushed
and
stumbled
mahony
laughed
at
her
slip
and
smoothed
her
hair
typical
fates
love
they
must
be
mine
besides
polly
you
forgetting
the
main
thing
how
i
hate
the
place
and
how
i
always
longed
to
get
away
no
i
not
but
please
let
me
go
you
know
richard
every
one
believes
some
day
ballarat
will
be
the
chief
city
bigger
even
than
geelong
or
melbourne
and
then
to
have
a
good
practice
here
would
mean
ever
such
a
lot
of
money
i
not
the
only
person
who
thinks
so
there
sara
and
beamish
i
know
of
course
you
do
care
much
what
they
say
but
still
polly
meant
still
you
see
i
have
public
opinion
on
my
side
as
however
once
more
words
failed
her
she
hastened
to
add
john
too
is
amazed
to
hear
you
think
of
going
home
to
bury
yourself
in
some
little
english
village
he
sure
there
be
a
splendid
opening
for
you
here
john
thinks
very
very
highly
of
you
he
told
me
he
believes
you
would
have
saved
emma
life
if
you
had
been
there
i
much
obliged
to
your
brother
for
his
confidence
said
mahony
dryly
but
wait
a
minute
richard
you
see
dear
i
ca
help
feeling
myself
that
you
ought
not
to
be
too
hasty
in
deciding
of
course
i
know
young
and
have
had
much
experience
but
you
see
you
known
here
richard
and
that
always
something
in
england
you
be
a
perfect
stranger
and
though
you
may
say
there
are
too
many
doctors
on
the
flat
still
if
the
place
goes
on
growing
as
it
is
doing
soon
be
room
for
more
and
then
if
it
is
you
it
just
be
some
one
else
and
that
does
seem
a
pity
when
you
are
so
clever
so
much
much
cleverer
than
other
people
yes
i
know
all
about
it
beamish
told
me
it
was
you
i
owed
my
life
to
not
rogers
at
which
mahony
winced
indignant
that
anyone
should
have
betrayed
to
polly
how
near
death
she
had
been
oh
i
do
want
people
to
know
you
for
what
you
really
are
said
little
polly
pussy
i
believe
she
has
ambitions
for
her
husband
said
mahony
to
palmerston
of
course
i
have
you
say
you
hate
ballarat
and
all
that
but
have
you
ever
thought
richard
what
a
difference
it
would
make
if
you
were
in
a
better
position
you
think
people
look
down
on
you
because
in
trade
but
if
you
were
a
doctor
there
be
none
of
that
you
call
yourself
by
your
full
name
again
and
write
it
down
on
the
visiting
list
at
government
house
and
be
as
good
as
anybody
and
be
asked
into
society
and
keep
a
horse
you
live
in
a
bigger
house
and
have
a
room
to
yourself
and
time
to
read
and
write
i
quite
sure
you
make
lots
of
money
and
soon
be
at
the
top
of
the
tree
and
after
all
dear
richard
i
do
want
to
go
home
i
would
much
rather
stay
here
and
look
after
jerry
and
dear
ned
and
poor
john
children
said
polly
falling
back
as
a
forlorn
hope
on
her
own
preference
why
what
a
piece
of
special
pleading
cried
mahony
and
leaning
forward
he
kissed
the
young
flushed
face
do
laugh
at
me
i
in
earnest
why
no
child
but
polly
my
dear
even
if
i
were
tempted
for
a
moment
to
think
seriously
of
what
you
say
where
would
the
money
come
from
fees
are
high
it
true
if
the
ball
once
set
but
till
then
with
a
jewel
of
a
wife
like
mine
i
be
a
scoundrel
to
take
risks
polly
had
been
waiting
for
this
question
on
hearing
it
she
sat
back
on
her
heels
and
drew
a
deep
breath
the
communication
she
had
now
to
make
him
was
the
hub
round
which
all
turned
should
he
refuse
to
consider
it
plucking
at
the
fringe
of
the
tablecloth
she
brought
out
piecemeal
the
news
that
john
was
willing
to
go
surety
for
the
money
they
would
need
to
borrow
for
the
start
not
only
that
he
offered
them
a
handsome
sum
weekly
to
take
entire
charge
of
his
not
here
in
this
little
house
i
know
that
would
do
polly
hastened
to
throw
in
forestalling
the
objection
she
read
in
richard
eyes
now
did
he
not
think
he
should
weigh
an
offer
of
this
kind
very
carefully
a
name
like
john
was
not
to
be
despised
most
people
in
their
position
would
jump
at
it
i
understand
something
about
it
said
the
little
woman
and
sagely
nodded
her
head
for
when
i
was
in
geelong
beamish
tried
his
hardest
to
raise
some
money
and
could
his
sureties
were
good
enough
mahony
had
not
the
heart
to
chide
her
for
discussing
his
private
affairs
with
her
brother
indeed
he
rather
admired
the
businesslike
way
she
had
gone
about
it
and
he
admitted
this
by
ceasing
to
banter
and
by
calling
her
attention
to
the
various
hazards
and
inconveniences
the
step
would
entail
polly
heard
him
out
in
silence
enough
for
her
in
the
beginning
that
he
did
not
decline
they
had
a
long
talk
the
end
of
which
was
that
he
promised
to
sleep
over
john
proposal
and
delay
fixing
the
date
of
the
auction
till
the
morning
having
yielded
this
point
mahony
kissed
his
wife
and
sent
her
to
bed
himself
going
out
with
the
dog
for
his
usual
stroll
it
was
a
fine
night
moonless
but
thick
with
stars
so
much
at
least
could
be
said
in
favour
of
the
place
there
was
abundant
you
got
a
clear
half
of
the
great
vault
at
once
how
he
pitied
on
such
a
night
the
dwellers
in
old
congested
cities
whose
view
of
the
starry
field
was
limited
to
a
narrow
strip
cut
through
yet
he
walked
with
a
springless
tread
the
fact
was
certain
of
his
wife
words
had
struck
home
and
in
the
course
of
the
past
year
he
had
learnt
to
put
considerable
faith
in
polly
practical
judgment
as
he
wound
his
way
up
the
little
hill
to
which
he
had
often
carried
his
perplexities
he
let
his
pipe
go
out
and
forgot
to
whistle
pompey
off
butcher
garbage
sitting
down
on
a
log
he
rested
his
chin
in
his
hands
below
him
twinkled
the
sparse
lights
of
the
flat
shouts
and
singing
rose
from
the
and
so
john
would
have
been
willing
to
go
surety
for
him
let
no
one
say
the
unexpected
did
not
happen
all
said
and
done
they
were
little
more
than
strangers
to
each
other
and
john
had
no
notion
what
his
capacities
as
a
doctor
might
be
it
was
true
polly
had
been
too
delicate
to
mention
whether
the
affair
had
come
about
through
her
persuasions
or
on
john
own
initiative
john
might
have
some
ulterior
motive
up
his
sleeve
perhaps
he
did
not
want
to
lose
his
sister
or
was
scheming
to
bind
a
pair
of
desirables
fast
to
this
colony
the
welfare
of
which
he
had
so
much
at
heart
again
it
might
be
that
he
wished
to
buy
off
the
memory
of
that
day
on
which
he
had
stripped
his
soul
naked
simplest
of
all
why
should
he
not
be
merely
trying
to
pay
back
a
debt
he
mahony
might
shrink
from
lying
under
an
obligation
to
john
but
so
far
the
latter
had
not
scrupled
to
accept
favours
from
him
but
that
was
always
the
way
with
your
rich
men
they
were
not
troubled
by
paltry
pride
for
they
knew
it
was
possible
to
acquit
themselves
of
their
debts
at
a
moment
notice
and
with
interest
this
led
him
to
reflect
on
the
great
help
to
him
the
loan
of
his
wealthy
relative
name
would
be
difficulties
would
melt
before
it
and
surely
no
undue
risk
was
involved
in
the
use
of
it
without
boasting
he
thought
he
was
better
equipped
both
by
aptitude
and
training
than
the
ruck
of
colonial
practitioners
did
he
enter
the
lists
he
could
hardly
fail
to
succeed
and
out
here
even
a
moderate
success
spelled
a
fortune
gained
too
after
which
the
lucky
individual
sold
out
and
went
home
to
live
in
comfort
yes
that
was
a
point
and
not
to
be
overlooked
no
definite
surrender
of
hopes
was
called
for
only
a
postponement
ten
years
might
do
it
meaty
years
of
course
the
best
years
of
one
life
still
it
would
mean
very
hard
work
but
had
he
not
just
been
contemplating
with
perfect
equanimity
an
even
more
arduous
venture
on
the
other
side
what
a
capricious
piece
of
mechanism
was
the
human
brain
another
thought
that
occurred
to
him
was
that
his
services
might
prove
more
useful
to
this
new
country
than
to
the
old
where
able
men
abounded
he
recalled
many
good
lives
and
promising
cases
he
had
here
seen
lost
and
bungled
to
take
the
instance
nearest
home
confinement
yes
to
show
his
mettle
to
such
as
rogers
to
earn
respect
where
he
had
lived
as
a
mere
null
the
idea
had
an
insidious
fascination
and
as
polly
sagely
remarked
if
it
were
not
he
it
would
be
some
one
else
another
would
harvest
the
kudos
that
might
have
been
his
for
the
treatment
the
blue
pills
and
black
draughts
that
had
satisfied
the
early
diggers
had
fallen
into
disrepute
medical
skill
was
beginning
to
be
appreciated
if
this
went
on
ballarat
would
soon
stand
on
a
level
with
any
city
of
its
size
at
home
but
even
as
it
was
he
had
never
been
quite
fair
to
it
he
had
seen
it
with
a
jaundiced
eye
and
again
he
believed
polly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
she
asserted
that
the
poor
position
he
had
occupied
was
responsible
for
much
of
his
dislike
but
there
was
something
else
at
work
in
him
besides
below
the
surface
an
admission
awaited
him
which
he
shrank
from
making
all
these
pros
and
cons
these
quibbles
and
were
but
a
misfit
attempt
to
cloak
the
truth
he
might
gull
himself
with
them
for
a
time
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
would
yield
if
yield
he
did
because
he
was
by
nature
only
too
prone
to
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
what
he
had
gone
through
was
no
new
experience
often
enough
after
fretting
and
fuming
about
a
thing
till
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
under
the
sun
had
ever
mattered
so
much
to
him
it
could
happen
that
he
suddenly
threw
up
the
sponge
and
bowed
to
circumstance
his
vitality
exhausted
itself
beforehand
in
a
passionate
aversion
a
torrent
of
words
and
failed
him
at
the
critical
moment
it
was
a
weakness
in
his
blood
in
the
blood
of
his
but
in
the
present
instance
he
had
an
excuse
for
himself
he
had
not
known
till
polly
came
out
with
her
brother
offer
how
he
dreaded
having
to
begin
all
over
again
in
england
an
utter
stranger
without
influence
or
recommendations
and
with
no
money
to
speak
of
at
his
back
but
now
he
owned
up
and
there
was
no
more
need
of
shift
or
subterfuge
now
it
was
one
rush
and
hurry
to
the
end
he
had
capitulated
a
aversion
to
confronting
difficulties
when
he
saw
the
chance
of
avoiding
them
had
won
the
day
he
intended
had
perhaps
the
whole
time
intended
to
take
the
hand
held
out
to
him
after
all
why
not
anyone
else
as
polly
said
would
have
jumped
at
john
offer
he
alone
must
argue
himself
blue
in
the
face
over
it
but
as
he
sat
and
pondered
the
lengthy
chain
of
circumstance
share
in
it
john
his
own
even
the
part
played
by
incorporeal
things
he
brought
up
short
against
the
word
decision
he
might
flatter
himself
by
imagining
he
had
been
free
to
decide
in
reality
nothing
was
further
from
the
truth
he
had
been
subtly
and
slily
guided
to
his
goal
led
blindfold
along
a
road
that
not
of
his
choosing
everything
and
every
one
had
combined
to
constrain
him
his
favours
to
john
the
failure
of
his
business
polly
inclinations
and
persuasions
his
own
fastidious
shrinkings
so
that
in
the
end
all
he
had
had
to
do
was
to
brush
aside
a
flimsy
gossamer
veil
which
hung
between
him
and
his
fate
was
it
straining
a
point
to
see
in
the
whole
affair
the
workings
of
a
power
outside
himself
against
himself
in
so
far
as
it
took
no
count
of
his
poor
vision
well
if
this
were
so
better
still
his
ways
were
in
god
hand
and
after
all
what
did
it
matter
where
one
strove
to
serve
maker
east
or
west
or
south
or
north
and
whether
the
stars
overhead
were
grouped
in
this
constellation
or
in
that
their
light
was
a
pledge
that
one
would
never
be
overlooked
or
forgotten
traced
by
the
hand
of
him
who
had
promised
to
note
even
a
sparrow
fall
and
here
he
spoke
aloud
into
the
darkness
the
ancient
and
homely
formula
that
is
in
face
of
the
untried
the
unknown
if
god
wills

chapter
i
the
house
stood
not
far
from
the
great
swamp
it
was
of
with
a
galvanised
iron
roof
and
might
have
been
built
from
a
drawing
of
a
house
a
door
in
the
centre
a
little
window
on
either
side
a
chimney
at
each
end
since
the
ground
sloped
downwards
the
front
part
rested
on
piles
some
three
feet
high
and
from
the
rutty
that
would
one
day
be
a
street
wooden
steps
led
up
to
the
door
much
as
mahony
would
have
liked
to
face
it
with
a
verandah
he
did
not
feel
justified
in
spending
more
than
he
could
help
and
polly
not
only
agreed
with
him
but
contrived
to
find
an
advantage
in
the
plainer
style
of
architecture
your
plate
will
be
better
seen
richard
right
on
the
street
than
hidden
under
a
verandah
but
then
polly
was
overflowing
with
content
had
not
two
of
the
rooms
fireplaces
and
was
there
not
a
with
a
real
copper
in
it
behind
the
detached
kitchen
not
to
speak
of
a
spare
room
to
the
rear
of
the
house
a
high
enclosed
a
yard
mahony
dreamed
of
a
garden
polly
of
keeping
hens
there
were
no
two
happier
people
on
ballarat
that
autumn
than
the
mahonys
to
and
fro
they
trudged
down
the
hill
across
the
flat
over
the
bridge
and
up
the
other
side
first
through
a
sahara
of
dust
then
when
the
rains
began
in
gluey
red
mud
and
the
building
of
the
finest
mansion
never
gave
half
so
much
satisfaction
as
did
that
of
this
flimsy
little
wooden
house
with
its
thin
walls
in
fancy
they
had
furnished
it
and
lived
in
it
long
before
it
was
even
roofed
in
mahony
sat
at
work
in
his
surgery
it
measured
ten
by
twelve
polly
at
her
in
the
parlour
opposite
and
a
cage
with
a
little
parrot
in
it
hanging
at
the
window
the
preliminaries
to
the
change
had
gone
smoothly
enough
mahony
could
not
complain
pleasant
they
had
not
been
but
could
the
arranging
and
clinching
of
a
complicated
ever
be
pleasant
he
had
had
to
submit
to
hearing
his
private
affairs
gone
into
by
a
stranger
to
make
clear
to
strangers
his
capacity
for
earning
a
decent
income
with
john
promissory
letter
in
his
pocket
he
had
betaken
himself
to
henry
ocock
office
this
notwithstanding
its
excellent
position
on
the
brow
of
the
western
hill
could
not
deny
its
humble
origin
as
a
the
entry
was
by
a
yard
and
some
of
the
former
had
been
rudely
knocked
together
to
provide
accommodation
mahony
sniffed
stale
dung
in
what
had
once
been
the
two
young
men
sat
at
work
why
tom
my
lad
you
here
tom
ocock
raised
his
freckled
face
from
the
chin
of
which
sprouted
some
long
fair
hairs
and
turned
red
yes
it
me
do
you
want
to
see
at
an
open
kick
from
his
brother
mr
ocock
if
you
please
informed
by
grindle
that
the
captain
was
at
liberty
mahony
passed
to
an
inner
room
where
he
was
waved
to
a
chair
in
answer
to
his
statement
that
he
had
called
to
see
about
raising
some
money
ocock
returned
an
indeed
money
is
tight
sir
very
tight
his
face
instantly
taking
on
the
solemnity
proper
to
dealings
with
this
world
main
asset
mahony
did
not
at
once
hand
over
john
letter
he
thought
he
would
first
test
the
lawyer
attitude
towards
him
in
person
a
species
of
men
of
his
make
are
rarely
able
to
withstand
he
spoke
of
the
decline
of
his
business
of
his
idea
of
setting
up
as
a
doctor
and
building
himself
a
house
and
as
he
talked
he
read
his
answer
pat
and
clear
in
the
ferrety
eyes
before
him
there
was
a
bored
tolerance
of
his
wordiness
an
utter
lack
of
interest
in
the
concerns
of
the
petty
tradesman
h
ocock
lying
back
in
his
chair
was
fitting
five
outstretched
fingers
to
their
fellows
all
very
well
my
good
sir
but
may
i
ask
if
you
have
anyone
in
view
as
a
security
i
have
may
i
trouble
you
to
glance
through
this
and
triumphantly
mahony
brandished
john
letter
ocock
raised
his
brows
what
john
turnham
ah
very
good
very
good
indeed
the
change
in
his
manner
would
have
made
a
cat
laugh
he
sat
upright
was
interested
courteous
alert
quite
in
order
and
now
pray
how
much
do
we
need
unadvised
he
had
not
been
able
said
mahony
to
determine
the
sum
so
ocock
took
pencil
and
paper
and
prior
to
running
off
a
reckoning
put
him
through
a
sharp
interrogation
under
it
mahony
felt
as
though
his
clothing
was
being
stripped
piece
by
piece
off
his
back
at
one
moment
he
stood
revealed
as
mean
and
stingy
at
another
as
an
unpractical
spendthrift
more
serious
things
came
out
besides
he
began
to
see
under
the
limelight
of
the
lawyer
inquiry
in
what
a
fashion
he
had
managed
his
business
and
how
unlikely
it
was
he
could
ever
have
made
a
good
thing
of
it
still
worse
was
his
thoughtless
folly
in
wedding
and
bringing
home
a
young
wife
without
in
this
settlement
where
accident
was
rife
where
fires
were
of
nightly
occurrence
insuring
against
either
fire
or
death
not
that
ocock
breathed
a
hint
of
censure
all
was
done
with
a
twist
of
the
eye
a
purse
of
the
lip
but
it
was
enough
for
mahony
he
sat
there
feeling
like
an
eel
in
the
skinning
and
did
not
attempt
to
keep
pace
with
the
lawyer
who
hunted
figures
into
the
centre
of
a
woolly
maze
the
upshot
of
these
calculations
was
he
would
need
help
to
the
tune
of
something
over
one
thousand
pounds
as
matters
stood
at
present
on
ballarat
said
ocock
the
plainest
house
he
could
build
would
cost
him
eight
hundred
and
another
couple
of
hundred
would
go
in
furnishing
while
a
might
be
put
down
at
fifty
pounds
on
letter
he
ocock
would
be
prepared
to
borrow
seven
hundred
for
him
and
this
could
probably
be
obtained
at
ten
per
cent
on
a
mortgage
of
the
house
and
a
further
four
hundred
for
which
he
would
have
to
pay
twelve
or
fifteen
current
expenses
must
be
covered
by
the
residue
of
this
savings
and
by
what
he
was
able
to
make
they
would
include
the
keep
of
the
horse
and
the
interest
on
the
borrowed
money
which
might
be
reckoned
roughly
at
a
hundred
and
twenty
per
annum
in
addition
he
would
be
well
advised
to
insure
his
life
for
five
to
seven
hundred
pounds
the
question
also
came
up
whether
the
land
he
had
selected
for
building
on
should
be
purchased
or
not
he
was
for
doing
so
for
settling
the
whole
business
there
and
then
ocock
however
took
the
opposite
view
considering
said
he
that
the
site
chosen
was
far
from
the
centre
of
the
town
mahony
might
safely
postpone
buying
in
the
meanwhile
there
had
been
no
government
of
late
and
all
frontages
had
still
to
come
under
the
hammer
as
occupier
when
the
time
arrived
he
would
have
first
chance
at
the
upset
price
though
then
it
was
true
he
would
also
be
liable
for
improvements
the
one
thing
he
must
beware
of
was
of
enclosing
too
small
a
block
mahony
agreed
agreed
to
everything
the
affair
seemed
to
have
passed
out
of
his
hands
a
sense
of
dismay
invaded
him
while
he
listened
to
the
lawyer
tick
off
the
obligations
and
responsibilities
he
was
letting
himself
in
for
a
thousand
pounds
he
to
run
into
debt
for
such
a
sum
who
had
never
owed
a
farthing
to
anyone
he
fell
to
doubting
whether
after
all
he
had
made
choice
of
the
easier
way
and
lapsed
into
a
gloomy
silence
ocock
on
the
other
hand
warmed
to
geniality
may
i
say
doctor
how
wise
i
think
your
decision
to
come
over
to
us
he
spoke
as
if
ballarat
east
were
in
the
heart
of
the
russian
steppes
and
that
reminds
me
there
a
friend
of
mine
i
may
be
able
at
once
to
put
a
patient
in
your
way
mahony
walked
home
in
a
mood
of
depression
which
it
took
all
arts
to
dispel
under
its
influence
he
wrote
an
outspoken
letter
to
purdy
but
with
no
very
satisfactory
result
it
was
like
projecting
a
feeler
for
sympathy
into
the
void
so
long
was
it
since
they
had
met
and
so
widely
had
his
friend
life
branched
from
his
purdy
answer
it
was
headed
the
ovens
did
not
arrive
till
several
weeks
later
and
was
mainly
about
himself
in
a
way
i
with
you
old
he
wrote
you
cut
a
jolly
sight
better
figure
as
an
then
ever
you
done
behind
a
counter
but
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
stake
my
last
dollar
on
you
all
the
same
what
does
polly
say
as
for
me
old
boy
since
you
good
enough
to
ask
why
the
less
said
the
better
one
of
these
days
a
poor
worn
old
shicer
come
crawling
round
to
your
back
door
to
see
if
you
any
duds
you
can
spare
him
seriously
dick
old
man
once
more
and
the
lord
only
knows
how
i
going
to
win
through
in
the
course
of
that
winter
custom
died
a
natural
death
and
one
day
the
few
oddments
that
remained
having
been
sold
by
auction
mahony
and
his
assistant
nailed
boards
horizontally
across
the
entrance
to
the
store
the
day
of
weighing
out
pepper
and
salt
was
over
never
again
would
the
tinny
jangle
of
the
accursed
bell
smite
his
ears
the
next
thing
was
that
hempel
packed
his
chattels
and
departed
for
his
new
walk
in
life
mahony
was
not
sorry
to
see
him
go
hempel
thoughts
had
soared
far
above
the
counter
he
was
arrived
at
the
stage
of
i
just
as
good
as
you
which
everyone
here
reached
sooner
or
later
i
shall
always
be
pleased
to
hear
how
you
are
getting
on
mahony
spoke
kindly
but
in
a
tone
which
as
polly
who
stood
by
very
well
knew
people
were
apt
to
misunderstand
i
should
think
so
she
chimed
in
i
shall
feel
very
hurt
indeed
hempel
if
you
do
come
and
see
us
with
regard
to
long
jim
she
had
a
talk
with
her
husband
one
night
as
they
went
to
bed
there
really
wo
be
anything
for
him
to
do
in
the
new
house
no
heavy
crates
or
barrels
to
move
about
and
he
does
know
a
thing
about
horses
why
not
let
him
go
home
he
does
so
want
to
what
would
you
say
dear
to
giving
him
thirty
pounds
for
his
and
a
trifle
in
his
pocket
it
would
make
him
very
happy
and
he
be
off
your
hands
for
of
course
though
just
as
you
think
best
we
shall
need
every
penny
we
can
scrape
together
for
ourselves
polly
and
yet
my
dear
i
believe
you
right
in
the
new
house
as
you
say
he
be
a
mere
encumbrance
as
for
me
i
be
only
too
thankful
never
to
hear
his
cantankerous
old
pipe
again
i
do
know
now
what
evil
genius
prompted
me
to
take
him
in
evil
genius
indeed
retorted
polly
you
did
it
because
you
a
dear
good
man
think
so
wifey
i
inclined
to
put
it
down
to
sheer
dislike
of
botheration
irish
inertia
the
curse
of
our
race
yes
yes
i
knoo
you
be
wantin
to
get
rid
o
me
now
you
up
in
the
world
was
long
jim
answer
when
polly
broached
her
scheme
for
his
benefit
well
no
i
wo
say
anythin
against
you
mahony
you
treated
me
square
enough
but
always
thought
a
sight
above
one
an
when
does
lets
you
feel
it
this
was
more
than
polly
could
brook
and
sighing
and
groaning
as
you
have
done
to
get
home
jim
you
a
silly
ungrateful
old
man
even
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
poor
old
fellow
he
grumbled
so
long
now
that
he
forgotten
how
to
do
anything
else
she
afterwards
made
allowance
for
him
and
added
pierced
by
a
sudden
doubt
i
hope
his
wife
will
still
be
used
to
it
or
or
else
and
now
the
last
day
in
the
old
house
was
come
the
furniture
stacked
in
the
yard
awaited
the
dray
that
was
to
transport
it
hardly
worth
carrying
with
one
thought
mahony
when
he
saw
the
few
poor
sticks
exposed
to
the
searching
sunlight
pipe
in
mouth
he
mooned
about
feeling
chiefly
amazed
that
he
could
have
put
up
for
so
long
with
the
miserable
little
hut
which
his
house
stripped
of
its
trimmings
proved
to
be
his
reflections
were
cut
short
by
old
ocock
who
leaned
over
the
fence
to
bid
his
neighbours
no
disturbance
come
in
come
in
cried
mahony
with
the
rather
spurious
heartiness
one
is
prone
to
throw
into
a
final
invitation
and
polly
rose
from
her
knees
before
a
which
she
was
filling
with
crockery
and
bustled
away
to
fetch
the
cake
she
had
baked
for
such
an
occasion
i
miss
yer
bright
little
face
that
i
will
said
ocock
as
he
munched
with
the
relish
of
a
jerry
or
a
ned
he
held
his
slice
of
cake
in
the
hollow
of
one
great
palm
conveying
with
extreme
care
the
pieces
he
broke
off
to
his
mouth
you
must
come
and
see
us
as
soon
as
ever
we
settled
bless
you
you
soon
find
grander
friends
than
an
old
chap
like
me
ocock
and
you
with
three
sons
in
the
law
besides
mark
my
words
it
be
your
turn
next
to
build
mahony
removed
his
pipe
to
throw
in
we
have
you
over
with
us
yet
and
what
a
lovely
surprise
for
miss
amelia
when
she
arrives
to
find
a
house
awaiting
her
well
that
the
end
of
this
little
said
the
loaded
dray
had
driven
off
the
children
and
ellen
perched
on
top
of
the
furniture
and
he
was
giving
a
last
look
round
we
spent
some
very
happy
days
under
it
eh
my
dear
oh
very
said
polly
shaking
out
her
skirts
but
we
shall
be
just
as
happy
in
the
new
one
god
grant
we
may
it
not
too
much
to
hope
i
now
seen
all
the
downs
of
my
life
i
managed
to
pack
a
good
many
into
thirty
short
and
that
reminds
me
do
you
know
you
will
have
been
married
to
me
two
whole
years
come
next
friday
why
so
we
shall
cried
polly
and
was
transfixed
in
the
act
of
tying
her
how
time
does
fly
it
seems
only
the
other
day
i
saw
this
room
for
the
first
time
i
peeped
in
you
know
while
you
were
fetching
the
box
do
you
remember
how
i
cried
richard
i
was
afraid
of
a
spider
or
something
and
the
polly
of
eighteen
looked
back
with
a
motherly
amusement
at
her
eidolon
but
now
dear
if
you
ready
or
else
the
furniture
will
get
there
before
we
do
we
better
take
the
short
cut
across
soldiers
hill
that
the
cat
in
that
basket
for
you
to
carry
and
here
your
microscope
i
got
the
decanter
and
the
best
teapot
shall
we
go
chapter
ii
and
now
for
a
month
or
more
mahony
had
been
in
possession
of
a
room
that
was
all
his
own
did
he
retire
into
it
and
shut
the
door
he
could
make
sure
of
not
being
disturbed
polly
herself
tapped
before
entering
and
he
let
her
do
so
polly
was
dear
but
dearer
still
was
his
privacy
he
knew
too
that
she
was
happily
employed
the
and
furnishing
of
the
house
was
a
job
after
her
own
heart
she
had
proved
both
skilful
and
economical
at
it
thanks
to
her
they
had
used
a
bare
of
the
sum
allotted
by
ocock
for
the
purpose
and
this
was
well
for
any
number
of
unforeseen
expenses
had
cropped
up
at
the
last
moment
polly
had
a
real
knack
for
making
things
do
old
empty
boxes
for
instance
underwent
marvellous
transformations
at
her
hands
emerged
clad
in
chintz
and
muslin
as
sofas
and
she
hung
her
curtains
on
strings
and
herself
sewed
the
seams
of
the
parlour
carpet
squatting
on
the
floor
and
working
away
with
a
great
needle
shaped
like
a
scimitar
till
the
perspiration
ran
down
her
face
it
was
also
she
who
standing
on
the
put
up
the
only
two
pictures
they
possessed
ned
and
jerry
giving
opinions
on
the
straightness
of
her
eye
from
below
a
fancy
picture
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
in
the
parlour
a
print
of
harvey
discovering
the
circulation
of
the
blood
on
the
surgery
wall
from
where
he
sat
mahony
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
children
children
at
play
they
frolicked
with
pompey
in
the
yard
he
could
endure
them
now
that
he
was
not
for
ever
tumbling
over
them
yes
one
and
all
were
comfortably
established
under
the
new
roof
with
the
exception
of
poor
palmerston
the
cat
palmerston
had
declined
to
recognise
the
change
and
with
the
immoderate
of
his
kind
had
returned
night
after
night
to
his
old
haunts
for
some
time
mahony
regular
evening
walk
was
back
to
the
store
a
road
he
would
otherwise
not
have
taken
for
it
was
odious
to
him
to
see
polly
neat
little
appointments
going
to
rack
and
ruin
under
the
tenancy
of
a
dirty
irish
family
there
he
would
find
the
animal
sitting
in
melancholy
retrospect
again
and
again
he
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
home
till
that
night
when
no
puss
came
to
his
call
and
palmerston
the
black
and
glossy
was
seen
no
more
either
he
had
fallen
down
a
shaft
or
been
mangled
by
a
dog
or
stolen
cats
still
fetching
a
high
price
on
ballarat
the
window
of
mahony
room
faced
a
wide
view
not
a
fence
hardly
a
bit
of
scrub
or
a
tuft
of
marked
the
bare
expanse
of
uneven
ground
now
baked
brown
as
a
piecrust
by
the
december
sun
he
looked
across
it
to
the
cemetery
this
was
still
wild
and
unfenced
just
a
patch
of
rising
ground
where
it
was
permissible
to
bury
the
dead
only
the
day
before
the
second
anniversary
of
the
eureka
stockade
he
had
watched
some
two
to
three
hundred
men
with
crepe
on
their
hats
and
sleeves
a
pole
at
their
head
march
there
to
do
homage
to
their
fallen
comrades
the
dust
raised
by
the
shuffling
of
these
many
feet
had
accompanied
the
procession
like
a
moving
cloud
had
lingered
in
its
rear
like
the
smoke
from
a
fire
drays
and
lorries
crawled
for
ever
laboriously
along
it
seeming
glued
to
the
earth
by
the
monstrous
sticky
heat
of
the
veiled
sun
further
back
rose
a
number
of
bald
hills
rounded
swelling
hills
shaped
like
a
woman
breasts
and
behind
all
pale
against
the
tense
white
sky
was
the
embankment
of
the
distant
ranges
except
for
these
an
ugly
uninviting
outlook
and
one
to
which
he
seldom
lifted
his
eyes
his
room
pleased
him
better
polly
had
stretched
a
bright
green
drugget
on
the
floor
the
table
had
a
green
cloth
on
it
the
picture
showed
up
well
against
the
whitewashed
wall
behind
him
was
a
large
deal
cupboard
which
held
instruments
and
drugs
the
bookshelves
with
their
precious
burden
were
within
reach
of
his
hand
on
the
top
shelf
he
had
stacked
the
boxes
containing
his
botanical
and
other
specimens
the
first
week
or
so
there
was
naturally
little
doing
a
sprained
wrist
to
bandage
a
tooth
to
draw
a
case
of
to
keep
himself
from
growing
fidgety
he
overhauled
his
minerals
and
butterflies
and
renewed
faded
labels
this
done
he
went
on
to
jot
down
some
ideas
he
had
with
regard
to
the
presence
of
auriferous
veins
in
quartz
it
was
now
generally
agreed
that
quartz
was
the
matrix
but
on
the
question
of
how
the
gold
had
found
its
way
into
the
rock
opinions
were
sharply
divided
the
theory
of
igneous
injection
was
advanced
by
some
others
inclined
to
that
of
sublimation
mahony
leaned
to
a
combination
of
the
two
processes
and
spent
several
days
getting
his
thoughts
in
order
while
polly
bursting
with
pride
went
about
on
tiptoe
audibly
hushing
the
children
their
uncle
was
writing
for
the
newspapers
still
no
patients
worth
the
name
made
their
appearance
to
fend
off
the
black
worry
that
might
get
the
better
of
him
did
he
sit
idle
he
next
drew
his
bible
to
him
and
set
about
doing
methodically
what
he
had
so
far
undertaken
merely
by
fits
and
starts
deciding
for
himself
to
what
degree
the
scriptures
were
inspired
polly
was
neither
proud
nor
happy
while
this
went
on
and
let
the
children
romp
unchecked
at
present
it
was
not
so
much
the
welfare
of
her
husband
soul
she
feared
for
god
must
surely
know
by
this
time
what
a
good
man
richard
was
he
had
not
his
equal
she
thought
for
honesty
and
uprightness
he
was
kind
to
the
poor
and
the
sick
and
had
missed
a
single
sunday
at
church
since
their
marriage
but
all
that
would
not
help
if
once
he
got
the
reputation
of
being
an
infidel
then
nobody
would
want
him
as
a
doctor
at
all
casually
begun
mahony
studies
soon
absorbed
him
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
brought
up
in
the
mould
of
irish
protestantism
to
which
being
of
a
sober
and
devout
turn
of
mind
he
had
readily
submitted
he
had
been
tossed
as
a
youthful
student
into
the
freebooting
edinburgh
of
the
forties
edinburgh
was
alive
in
those
days
to
her
very
town
and
university
combined
to
form
a
hotbed
of
intellectual
unrest
a
for
disturbing
possibilities
the
development
theory
was
in
the
air
and
a
book
that
appeared
anonymously
had
boldly
voiced
in
popular
fashion
maillet
dream
and
the
lamarckian
hypothesis
of
a
creation
undertaken
once
and
for
all
in
place
of
a
continuous
creative
intenention
this
book
opposing
natural
law
to
miracle
carried
complete
conviction
to
the
young
and
eager
audacious
spirits
even
hazarded
the
conjecture
that
primitive
life
itself
might
have
originated
in
a
natural
way
had
not
but
recently
an
investigator
who
brought
a
powerful
voltaic
battery
to
bear
on
a
saturated
solution
of
silicate
of
potash
been
startled
to
find
as
the
result
of
his
experiment
numberless
small
mites
of
the
species
acarus
horridus
might
not
the
marvel
electricity
or
galvanism
in
action
on
albumen
turn
out
to
be
the
vitalising
force
to
the
orthodox
zoologist
phytologist
and
geologist
such
a
suggestion
savoured
of
madness
they
either
took
refuge
in
a
contemptuous
silence
or
condescended
only
to
reply
had
one
visited
the
garden
of
eden
during
creation
one
would
have
found
that
in
the
morning
man
was
not
while
in
the
evening
he
was
morning
and
evening
bearing
their
newly
established
significance
of
geological
epochs
the
famous
tracing
of
the
creator
footsteps
undertaken
by
a
gifted
compromiser
was
felt
by
even
the
most
bigoted
to
be
a
lame
rejoinder
his
asterolepsis
the
giant
from
the
old
red
sandstone
the
antiquity
of
which
should
show
that
the
origin
of
life
was
not
to
be
found
solely
in
infusorial
points
but
that
highly
developed
forms
were
among
the
earliest
created
this
single
prop
was
admittedly
not
strong
enough
to
carry
the
whole
burden
of
proof
no
the
immutability
of
species
had
been
seriously
impugned
and
bold
minds
asked
themselves
why
a
single
act
of
creation
at
the
outset
should
not
constitute
as
divine
an
origin
of
life
as
a
continued
series
of
creative
fiats
mahony
was
one
of
them
the
development
theory
did
not
repel
him
he
could
see
no
impiety
in
believing
that
life
once
established
on
the
earth
had
been
left
to
perfect
itself
or
hold
that
this
would
represent
the
divine
author
of
all
things
as
after
one
dreaming
away
eternal
ages
in
apathy
and
indifference
why
should
the
perfect
functioning
of
natural
law
not
be
as
convincing
an
expression
of
god
presence
as
a
series
of
cataclysmic
acts
of
creation
none
the
less
it
was
a
time
of
crisis
for
him
as
for
so
many
for
if
this
were
so
if
science
spoke
true
that
the
miracle
of
life
set
there
had
been
no
further
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
creator
then
the
very
stone
of
the
christian
faith
the
bible
itself
was
shaken
more
much
more
would
have
to
go
than
the
mosaic
cosmogony
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
just
as
the
elohistic
account
of
creation
had
been
stretched
to
fit
the
changed
views
of
geologists
so
the
greater
part
of
the
scriptural
narratives
stood
in
need
of
a
wider
interpretation
the
fable
of
the
eternal
personal
mediation
in
the
affairs
of
man
must
be
accepted
for
what
it
was
a
beautiful
allegory
the
fondly
dreamed
fulfilment
of
a
desire
and
bringing
thus
a
sharpened
critical
sense
to
bear
on
the
scriptures
mahony
embarked
on
his
voyage
of
discovery
before
him
but
more
as
a
warning
than
a
beacon
shone
the
example
of
a
famous
german
savant
who
taking
our
saviour
life
as
his
theme
demolished
the
sacred
idea
of
a
divine
miracle
and
retold
the
gospel
story
from
a
rationalistic
standpoint
a
savagely
unimaginative
piece
of
work
this
thought
mahony
and
one
that
laid
all
too
little
weight
on
the
deeps
of
poetry
the
mysteries
of
symbols
and
the
power
the
human
mind
drew
from
these
to
pierce
to
an
ideal
truth
his
own
modest
efforts
would
be
of
quite
another
kind
for
he
sought
not
to
deny
god
but
to
discover
him
anew
by
freeing
him
from
the
drift
of
error
superstition
and
which
the
centuries
had
accumulated
about
him
far
was
it
from
his
servant
mind
to
wish
to
decry
the
authority
of
the
book
of
books
this
he
believed
to
consist
in
great
part
of
inspired
utterances
and
for
the
rest
to
be
the
wisest
and
ripest
collection
of
moral
precept
and
example
that
had
come
down
to
us
from
the
ages
without
it
one
would
be
rudderless
indeed
a
castaway
in
a
cockleshell
boat
on
a
furious
sea
and
from
one
lips
would
go
up
a
cry
like
to
that
wrung
from
a
famous
infidel
i
am
affrighted
and
confounded
with
the
forlorn
solitude
in
which
i
am
placed
by
my
philosophy
begin
to
fancy
myself
in
the
most
deplorable
condition
imaginable
environed
by
the
deepest
darkness
no
mahony
was
not
one
of
those
who
held
that
the
christian
faith
that
fine
flower
of
man
spiritual
need
would
suffer
detriment
by
the
discarding
of
a
few
fabulous
tales
nor
did
he
fear
lest
his
own
faith
should
become
undermined
by
his
studies
for
he
had
that
in
him
which
told
him
that
god
was
and
this
instinctive
certainty
would
persist
he
believed
though
he
had
ultimately
to
admit
the
whole
fabric
of
christianity
to
be
based
on
the
arimathean
dream
it
had
already
survived
the
rejection
of
externals
the
surrender
of
forms
the
assurance
that
ceremonials
were
not
essential
to
salvation
belonged
to
his
early
now
he
determined
to
send
by
the
board
the
last
hampering
relics
of
bigotry
and
ritual
he
could
no
longer
concede
the
tenets
of
election
and
damnation
god
was
a
god
of
mercy
not
the
blind
jealous
jahveh
of
the
jews
or
the
inhuman
sabbatarian
of
a
narrow
protestantism
and
he
might
be
worshipped
anywhere
or
anyhow
in
any
temple
built
to
his
name
in
the
wilderness
under
the
open
sky
in
silent
prayer
or
according
to
any
creed
in
all
this
critical
readjustment
the
thought
he
had
to
spare
for
his
was
of
small
account
his
fate
was
not
bound
to
theirs
by
the
altruism
of
a
later
generation
it
was
a
time
of
intense
individualism
and
his
efforts
towards
spiritual
emancipation
were
made
on
his
own
behalf
alone
the
one
link
he
had
with
his
fellows
if
link
it
could
be
termed
was
his
earnest
wish
to
avoid
giving
offence
never
would
it
have
occurred
to
him
to
noise
his
heterodoxy
abroad
nor
did
he
want
to
disturb
other
people
convictions
he
respected
those
who
could
still
draw
support
from
the
old
faith
and
moreover
had
not
a
particle
of
the
proselytiser
in
him
he
held
that
religion
was
either
a
matter
of
temperament
or
of
geographical
distribution
felt
tolerantly
inclined
towards
the
jews
and
the
chinese
and
did
not
even
smile
at
processions
to
the
and
the
provisioning
of
those
silent
ones
who
needed
food
no
more
but
just
as
little
as
he
intermeddled
with
the
convictions
of
others
would
he
brook
interference
with
his
own
it
was
the
concern
of
no
third
person
what
paths
he
followed
in
his
journeyings
after
the
truth
in
his
quest
for
a
panacea
for
the
ills
and
delusions
of
life
for
call
it
what
he
would
biblical
criticism
scientific
inquiry
this
was
his
aim
first
and
last
he
was
trying
to
pierce
the
secret
of
existence
to
rede
the
riddle
that
has
never
been
what
am
i
whence
have
i
come
whither
am
i
going
what
meaning
has
the
pain
i
suffer
the
evil
that
men
do
can
evil
be
included
in
god
scheme
and
it
was
well
he
told
himself
as
he
pressed
forward
that
the
flame
in
him
burnt
unwaveringly
which
assured
him
of
his
kinship
with
the
eternal
of
the
kinship
of
all
created
things
so
unsettling
and
perplexing
were
the
conclusions
at
which
he
arrived
summoned
to
dinner
he
sat
at
table
with
stupid
hands
and
evasive
eyes
little
johnny
who
was
as
polly
put
it
as
sharp
as
mustard
was
prompt
to
note
his
uncle
vacancy
what
you
staring
at
nunkey
he
demanded
his
mouth
full
of
which
he
was
stuffing
down
with
all
possible
dispatch
hush

do
tease
your
uncle
what
do
you

i

young

squeezed
his

john
with
the
immense
contempt
of
five
years
i
did
say
anner
emeny
here
he
began
to
tuck
in
anew
aiding
the
slow
work
of
his
spoon
with
his
more
habile
fingers
a
emeny
d

like

he
shot
an
imaginary
gun
at
his
sister
who
squealed
and
ducked
her
head
an
ancient
wish
my
son
said
mahony
when
johnny
had
been
reproved
and
trotty
comforted
like
you
have
voiced
it
since
the
world
or
rather
since
war
first
began
do
care
nunkey
why
is
de
english
and
why
is
de
emeny
but
mahony
shrank
from
the
gush
of
whats
and
whys
he
would
let
loose
on
himself
did
he
attempt
to
answer
this
question
come
shall
uncle
make

some
boats
to

in
the
wiv
a
mast

cried
john
wildly
and
throwing
his
spoon
to
the
floor
he
scrambled
from
his
chair
oh
yes
nunkey
dear
nunkey
dea
unkey
echoed
the
shadow
oh
you
cupboard
lovers
you
said
mahony
as
order
restored
and
sticky
mouths
wiped
two
pudgy
hands
were
thrust
with
a
new
kindness
into
his
he
led
the
way
to
the
yard
and
having
whittled
out
for
the
children
some
chips
left
by
the
builders
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
the
house
here
through
a
veiling
of
smoke
which
hung
motionless
in
the
hot
still
air
he
watched
the
two
eager
little
mortals
before
him
add
their
quota
to
the
miracle
of
life
chapter
iii
polly
had
no
such
absorbing
occupation
to
tide
her
over
these
empty
days
of
waiting
and
sometimes
especially
late
in
the
afternoon
when
her
household
duties
were
done
the
children
safely
at
play
she
found
it
beyond
her
power
to
stitch
quietly
at
her
embroidery
letting
the
canvas
fall
to
her
knee
she
would
listen
listen
listen
till
the
blood
sang
in
her
ears
for
the
footsteps
and
knocks
at
the
door
that
never
came
and
did
she
draw
back
the
and
look
out
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
not
a
trace
of
the
string
of
prosperous
paying
patients
she
had
once
imagined
winding
their
way
to
the
door
and
meanwhile
richard
was
shut
up
in
his
room
making
those
dreadful
notes
in
the
bible
which
it
pinched
her
heart
even
to
think
of
he
really
did
not
seem
to
care
whether
he
had
a
practice
or
not
all
the
new
instruments
got
from
melbourne
lay
unused
in
their
casings
and
the
horse
was
eating
its
head
off
at
over
a
pound
a
week
in
the
polly
shrank
from
censuring
her
husband
even
in
thought
but
as
she
took
up
her
work
again
and
went
on
producing
in
wools
a
green
basket
of
yellow
fruit
on
a
magenta
ground
she
could
not
help
reflecting
what
she
would
have
done
at
this
pass
had
she
been
a
man
she
would
have
announced
the
beginning
of
her
practice
in
big
letters
in
the
star
and
she
would
have
gone
down
into
the
township
and
mixed
with
people
and
made
herself
known
with
richard
it
was
almost
as
if
he
felt
averse
from
bringing
himself
into
public
notice
only
another
month
now
and
the
second
instalment
of
interest
would
fall
due
polly
did
not
know
exactly
what
the
sum
was
but
she
did
know
the
date
the
first
time
they
had
had
no
difficulty
in
meeting
the
bill
owing
to
their
economy
in
furnishing
but
what
about
this
one
and
the
next
again
how
were
payments
to
be
made
and
kept
up
if
the
patients
would
not
come
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
she
was
ten
years
older
for
what
could
a
person
who
was
only
eighteen
be
supposed
to
understand
of
business
richard
invariable
answer
did
she
venture
a
word
was
not
to
worry
her
little
head
about
such
things
when
however
another
week
had
dribbled
away
in
the
same
fashion
polly
began
to
be
afraid
the
date
of
payment
had
slipped
his
memory
altogether
she
would
need
to
remind
him
of
it
even
at
the
risk
of
vexing
him
and
having
cast
about
for
a
pretext
to
intrude
she
decided
to
ask
his
advice
on
a
matter
that
was
giving
her
much
uneasiness
though
had
he
been
really
busy
she
would
have
gone
on
keeping
it
to
herself
it
related
to
little
johnny
johnny
was
a
passionate
child
who
needed
most
careful
handling
at
first
she
had
managed
him
well
enough
but
ever
since
his
five
months
he
had
fallen
into
deceitful
ways
and
the
habit
of
falsehood
was
gaining
on
him
bad
by
nature
polly
felt
sure
the
child
was
not
but
she
could
not
keep
him
on
the
straight
path
now
he
had
discovered
that
a
lie
might
save
him
a
punishment
he
was
not
to
be
shamed
out
of
telling
it
and
the
only
other
cure
polly
knew
of
was
whipping
she
whipped
him
and
provoked
him
to
fury
a
new
misdeed
on
his
part
gave
her
the
handle
she
sought
johnny
had
surreptitiously
entered
her
pantry
and
stolen
a
plateful
of
cakes
taxed
with
the
theft
he
denied
it
and
cornered
laid
the
blame
on
his
companion
asserting
that
trotty
had
persuaded
him
to
take
the
goodies
though
bewildered
innocence
was
writ
all
over
the
chubby
face
mahony
had
the
young
sinner
up
before
him
but
he
was
able
neither
to
touch
the
child
heart
nor
to
make
him
see
the
gravity
of
what
he
had
done
never
being
allowed
inside
the
surgery
john
could
now
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
wonderful
display
of
gold
and
purple
and
red
moths
which
were
pinned
with
outstretched
wings
to
a
sheet
of
cork
he
stood
and
absentminded
and
only
once
shot
a
blue
glance
at
his
uncle
to
say
but
if
dey
so
baddy
den
why
did
god
make
lies
an
de
debble
which
intelligent
query
hit
the
nail
of
one
of
mahony
own
misgivings
on
the
head
no
real
depravity
was
his
verdict
still
too
much
of
a
handful
it
was
plain
for
polly
inexperience
a
problem
for
john
himself
to
tackle
my
dear
why
should
we
have
to
drill
a
morality
into
his
progeny
besides
i
not
going
to
have
you
blamed
for
bad
results
later
on
he
would
write
to
john
there
and
then
and
request
that
johnny
be
removed
from
their
charge
polly
was
not
prepared
for
this
summary
solution
of
her
dilemma
and
began
to
regret
having
brought
it
up
though
she
could
not
but
agree
with
richard
that
it
would
never
do
for
the
younger
child
to
be
corrupted
by
a
bad
example
however
she
kept
her
wits
about
her
did
john
take
the
boy
away
said
she
she
was
afraid
she
would
have
to
ask
for
a
larger
housekeeping
allowance
the
withdrawal
of
the
money
for
johnny
board
would
make
a
difference
to
their
income
of
course
returned
mahony
easily
and
was
about
to
dismiss
the
subject
but
polly
stood
her
ground
talking
of
money
richard
i
do
know
whether
you
remember
you
been
so
busy
that
it
only
about
a
fortnight
now
till
the
second
lot
of
interest
falls
due
what
a
fortnight
exclaimed
her
husband
and
reached
out
for
an
almanack
good
lord
so
it
is
and
nothing
doing
yet
polly
absolutely
nothing
well
dear
you
ca
expect
to
jump
into
a
big
practice
all
at
once
can
you
but
you
see
i
think
the
trouble
is
not
nearly
enough
people
know
you
started
and
a
little
imploringly
and
very
apologetically
polly
unfolded
her
artless
schemes
for
wife
i
a
grave
suspicion
said
mahony
and
took
her
by
the
chin
while
i
sat
here
with
my
head
in
the
clouds
you
been
worrying
over
ways
and
means
and
over
having
such
an
unpractical
old
dreamer
for
a
husband
now
child
that
wo
do
i
did
marry
to
have
my
girl
puzzling
her
little
brains
where
her
next
day
dinner
was
to
come
from
away
with
you
to
your
stitching
things
will
be
all
right
trust
to
me
and
polly
did
trust
him
and
was
so
satisfied
with
what
she
had
effected
that
raising
her
face
for
a
kiss
she
retired
with
an
easy
mind
to
overhaul
johnny
little
wardrobe
but
the
door
having
clicked
behind
her
mahony
air
of
forced
assurance
died
away
for
an
instant
he
hesitated
beside
the
table
on
which
a
rampart
of
books
lay
open
then
vigorously
clapped
each
volume
to
and
moved
to
the
window
chewing
at
the
ends
of
his
beard
a
timely
interruption
what
the
dickens
had
he
been
about
to
forget
himself
in
this
fool
paradise
when
the
crassest
of
material
anxieties
that
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
was
crouched
at
his
door
that
night
he
wakened
with
a
jerk
from
an
uneasy
sleep
though
at
noon
the
day
before
the
thermometer
had
registered
over
a
hundred
in
the
shade
it
was
now
bitterly
cold
and
these
abrupt
changes
of
temperature
always
whipped
up
his
nerves
even
after
he
had
piled
his
clothes
and
an
on
top
of
the
blankets
he
could
not
drop
off
again
he
lay
staring
at
the
moonlit
square
of
the
window
and
thinking
the
black
thoughts
of
night
what
if
he
could
not
manage
to
work
up
a
practice
found
it
impossible
to
make
a
living
his
plate
had
been
on
the
door
for
close
on
two
months
now
and
he
had
barely
a
note
to
show
for
it
what
was
to
be
done
here
polly
words
came
back
to
him
with
new
stress
not
nearly
enough
people
know
you
started
that
was
it
polly
had
laid
her
finger
on
the
hitch
the
genteel
manners
of
the
old
country
did
not
answer
here
instead
of
sitting
twiddling
his
thumbs
waiting
for
patients
to
seek
him
out
he
ought
to
have
adopted
the
screaming
methods
of
advertisement
in
vogue
on
ballarat
to
have
had
holloway
pills
sold
here
teeth
extracted
painlessly
cures
guaranteed
painted
on
his
outside
to
have
gone
up
and
down
and
round
the
township
to
have
been
on
the
spot
when
accidents
happened
to
have
hobnobbed
with
tom
dick
and
harry
in
bars
and
saloons
and
he
saw
a
figure
that
looked
like
his
the
centre
of
a
boisterous
crowd
saw
himself
slapped
on
the
back
by
dirty
hands
shouting
and
shouted
to
drinks
he
turned
his
pillow
to
drive
the
image
away
whatever
he
had
done
or
not
done
the
fact
remained
that
a
couple
of
weeks
hence
he
had
to
make
up
the
sum
of
over
thirty
pounds
and
again
he
discerned
a
phantom
self
this
time
a
humble
supplicant
for
an
extension
of
term
brought
up
short
against
ocock
stony
visage
flouted
by
his
cocksy
clerk
once
more
he
turned
his
pillow
these
quarterly
payments
which
dotted
all
his
coming
years
were
like
little
studding
the
surface
of
an
ocean
and
telling
of
the
sunken
continent
below
this
monstrous
thousand
odd
pounds
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
borrow
never
would
he
be
able
to
pay
off
such
a
sum
never
again
be
free
from
the
incubus
of
debt
meanwhile
not
the
ground
he
stood
on
not
the
roof
over
his
head
could
actually
be
called
his
own
he
had
also
been
too
pushed
for
money
at
the
time
to
take
ocock
advice
and
insure
his
life
these
thoughts
spun
themselves
to
a
in
which
he
was
the
hapless
fly
putting
a
finger
to
his
wrist
he
found
he
had
the
pulse
of
a
hundred
that
was
not
uncommon
to
him
he
got
out
of
bed
to
dowse
his
head
in
a
basin
of
water
polly
only
half
awake
sat
up
and
said
what
the
matter
dear
are
you
ill
in
replying
to
her
he
disturbed
the
children
the
door
of
whose
room
stood
ajar
and
by
the
time
quiet
was
restored
further
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
he
dressed
and
quitted
the
house
day
was
breaking
the
moon
but
an
hour
back
a
globe
of
polished
silver
had
now
no
light
left
in
her
and
stole
a
misty
ghost
across
the
sky
a
bank
of
clouds
that
had
had
their
on
the
summit
of
mount
warrenheip
was
beginning
to
disperse
and
the
air
had
lost
its
edge
he
walked
out
beyond
the
cemetary
then
sat
down
on
a
and
looked
back
the
houses
that
nestled
on
the
slope
were
growing
momently
whiter
but
the
flat
was
still
sunk
in
shadow
and
haze
making
old
warrenheip
for
all
its
miles
of
distance
seem
near
enough
to
be
touched
by
hand
but
even
in
full
daylight
this
woody
peak
had
a
way
of
tricking
the
eye
from
the
brow
of
the
western
hill
with
the
flat
out
of
sight
below
it
appeared
to
stand
at
the
very
foot
of
those
streets
that
headed
east
first
of
one
then
of
another
moving
with
you
as
you
changed
position
like
the
eyes
of
a
portrait
that
follow
you
wherever
you
and
now
the
sky
was
streaked
with
the
last
clouds
scattered
drenched
in
orange
and
rose
and
flames
burned
in
the
glass
of
every
up
came
the
tip
of
the
sun
rim
grew
to
a
fiery
quarter
to
a
half
till
bounding
free
from
the
horizon
it
began
to
mount
and
to
lose
its
girth
in
the
immensity
of
the
sky
the
phantasms
of
the
night
yielded
like
the
clouds
to
its
power
he
was
still
reasonably
young
reasonably
sound
and
had
the
better
part
of
a
lifetime
before
him
rising
with
a
fresh
alacrity
he
whistled
to
his
dog
and
walked
briskly
home
to
bath
and
breakfast
but
that
evening
at
the
heel
of
another
empty
day
his
nervous
restlessness
took
him
anew
from
her
parlour
polly
could
hear
the
thud
of
his
feet
going
up
and
down
up
and
down
his
room
and
it
was
she
who
was
to
blame
for
disturbing
him
yet
what
else
could
i
do
and
meditatively
pricking
her
needle
in
and
out
of
the
polly
fell
into
a
reverie
over
her
husband
and
his
ways
how
strange
richard
was
how
difficult
first
to
be
able
to
forget
all
about
how
things
stood
with
him
and
then
to
be
twice
as
upset
as
other
people
john
demanded
the
immediate
delivery
of
his
young
son
undertaking
soon
to
knock
all
nasty
tricks
out
of
him
on
the
day
fixed
for
departure
husband
and
wife
were
astir
soon
after
dawn
mahony
was
to
have
taken
the
child
down
to
the
but
johnny
had
been
awake
since
two
with
excitement
and
was
now
so
fractious
that
polly
tied
on
her
bonnet
and
accompanied
them
she
knew
hatred
of
a
scene
you
just
walk
on
dear
and
get
his
seat
she
said
while
she
dragged
the
cross
tired
child
on
her
hand
to
the
where
even
at
this
hour
a
posse
of
idlers
hung
about
and
she
did
well
to
be
there
instantly
on
arriving
johnny
set
up
a
wail
because
there
was
talk
of
putting
him
inside
the
vehicle
and
this
persisted
until
the
coachman
a
yankee
came
to
the
rescue
and
said
he
was
darned
if
such
a
plucky
young
nipper
get
his
way
he
have
the
child
tied
on
beside
him
on
the
be
blowed
if
he
would
but
even
this
did
not
satisfy
johnny
and
while
mahony
went
to
procure
a
length
of
rope
he
continued
to
prance
round
his
aunt
and
to
tug
ceaselessly
at
her
sleeve
can
i
dwive
aunt
polly
can
i
dwive
ask
him
can
i
dwive
he
roared
beating
her
skirts
with
his
fists
he
was
only
silenced
by
the
driver
threatening
to
throw
him
as
a
juicy
morsel
to
the
gang
of
bushrangers
who
sure
as
blazes
would
be
waiting
to
stick
the
coach
up
directly
it
entered
the
bush
husband
and
wife
lingered
to
watch
the
start
when
the
champing
horses
took
a
headlong
plunge
forward
and
together
with
the
coach
were
swallowed
up
in
a
whirlwind
of
dust
a
last
glimpse
discovered
johnny
pale
and
at
the
lurching
speed
but
sitting
bravely
erect
the
spirit
of
your
brother
in
that
child
my
dear
said
mahony
as
they
made
to
walk
home
poor
little
johnny
and
polly
wiped
her
eyes
if
only
he
was
going
back
to
a
mother
who
loved
him
and
would
understand
i
sure
no
mother
could
have
done
more
for
him
than
you
love
yes
but
a
real
mother
would
need
to
give
him
up
however
naughty
he
had
been
i
think
the
young
varmint
might
have
shown
some
regret
at
parting
from
you
after
all
this
time
returned
her
husband
to
whom
it
was
offensive
if
even
a
child
was
lacking
in
good
feeling
he
never
turned
his
head
well
i
suppose
it
a
fact
as
they
say
that
the
natural
child
is
the
natural
barbarian
johnny
never
meant
any
harm
it
was
i
who
did
know
how
to
manage
him
said
polly
why
richard
what
is
the
matter
for
letting
her
arm
fall
mahony
had
dashed
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
good
god
polly
look
at
this
this
was
a
printed
notice
nailed
to
a
shed
which
announced
that
a
sale
of
frontages
in
mair
and
webster
streets
would
shortly
be
held
but
it
not
our
road
i
do
understand
good
lord
do
you
see
that
if
they
there
already
they
be
out
with
us
before
we
can
say
jack
robinson
and
then
where
shall
i
be
gave
back
mahony
testily
let
us
talk
it
over
but
first
come
home
and
have
breakfast
then
yes
then
i
think
you
should
go
down
and
see
henry
and
hear
what
he
says
you
right
i
must
see
confound
the
fellow
it
he
who
has
let
me
in
for
this
and
probably
he
know
some
way
out
what
else
is
a
lawyer
for
dear
quite
true
my
polly
none
the
less
it
looks
as
if
i
were
in
for
a
run
of
real
bad
luck
all
along
the
line
chapter
iv
one
hot
morning
some
few
days
later
polly
with
trotty
at
her
side
stood
on
the
doorstep
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
she
was
on
the
for
her
vegetable
man
who
drove
in
daily
from
the
springs
with
his
greenstuff
he
was
late
as
usual
if
richard
would
only
let
her
deal
with
the
cheaper
more
punctual
ah
sing
who
was
at
this
moment
coming
up
the
track
but
devine
was
a
reformed
character
after
as
a
digger
having
squandered
a
fortune
in
a
week
he
had
given
up
the
drink
and
backed
by
a
sober
wife
was
now
trying
to
earn
a
living
at
so
he
had
to
be
encouraged
the
chinaman
towards
them
his
baskets
his
mouth
stretched
to
a
friendly
grin
you
no
want
cabbagee
me
got
velly
good
cabbagee
he
said
persuasively
and
lowered
his
pole
no
thank
you
john
not
me
wait
for
white
man
me
bling
pleasant
for
lilly
missee
said
the
chow
and
unknotting
a
dirty
nosecloth
he
drew
from
it
an
ancient
lump
of
candied
ginger
lilly
missee
eatee
him
oh
yum
yum
velly
good
my
word
but
chinamen
to
trotty
were
fearsome
bogies
corresponding
to
the
of
the
english
nursery
she
hid
behind
her
aunt
holding
fast
to
the
latter
skirts
and
only
stealing
an
occasional
peep
from
one
blue
eye
thank
you
john
me
takee
chowchow
for
lilly
missee
said
polly
who
had
experience
in
disposing
of
such
savoury
morsels
you
no
buy
cabbagee
repeated
ah
sing
with
the
catlike
persistence
of
his
race
and
as
polly
with
equal
firmness
and
again
shook
her
head
he
shouldered
his
pole
and
departed
at
a
crooning
as
he
went
meanwhile
at
the
bottom
of
the
road
another
figure
had
come
into
view
it
was
not
devine
in
his
it
was
some
one
on
horseback
was
a
lady
in
a
holland
habit
the
horse
a
piebald
advanced
at
a
sober
pace
and
why
good
gracious
i
believe
she
coming
here
at
the
first
of
the
three
houses
the
rider
had
dismounted
and
knocked
at
the
door
with
the
butt
of
her
whip
after
a
word
with
the
woman
who
opened
she
threw
her
over
one
arm
put
the
other
through
the
bridle
and
was
now
making
straight
for
them
as
she
drew
near
she
smiled
showing
a
row
of
white
teeth
does
mahony
live
here
misfortune
of
misfortunes
richard
was
out
but
almost
instantly
polly
grasped
that
this
would
tell
in
his
favour
he
wo
be
long
i
know
i
wonder
said
the
lady
if
he
would
come
out
to
my
house
when
he
gets
back
i
am
mrs
glendinning
of
dandaloo
polly
flushed
with
sheer
satisfaction
dandaloo
was
one
of
the
largest
stations
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ballarat
oh
i
certain
he
will
she
answered
quickly
i
am
so
glad
you
think
so
said
glendinning
a
mutual
friend
henry
ocock
tells
me
how
clever
he
is
polly
brain
leapt
at
the
connection
on
the
occasion
of
last
visit
the
lawyer
had
again
repeated
the
promise
to
put
a
patient
in
his
way
ocock
was
one
of
those
people
said
richard
who
only
remembered
your
existence
when
he
saw
oh
what
a
blessing
in
disguise
had
been
that
troublesome
old
land
sale
the
lady
had
stooped
to
trotty
whom
she
was
trying
to
coax
from
her
what
a
darling
how
i
envy
you
have
you
no
children
polly
asked
shyly
when
trotty
relationship
had
been
explained
yes
a
boy
but
i
should
have
liked
a
little
girl
of
my
own
boys
are
so
difficult
and
she
sighed
the
horse
nuzzling
for
sugar
roused
polly
to
a
sense
of
her
remissness
wo
you
come
in
and
rest
a
little
after
your
ride
she
asked
and
without
hesitation
glendinning
said
she
would
like
to
very
much
indeed
and
tying
the
hone
to
the
fence
she
followed
polly
into
the
house
the
latter
felt
proud
this
morning
of
its
order
she
drew
up
the
best
armchair
placed
a
footstool
before
it
and
herself
carried
in
a
tray
with
refreshments
glendinning
had
taken
trotty
on
her
lap
and
given
the
child
her
long
gold
chains
to
play
with
polly
thought
her
the
most
charming
creature
in
the
world
she
had
a
slender
waist
and
an
abundant
light
brown
chignon
and
cheeks
of
a
beautiful
pink
in
which
two
fascinating
dimples
came
and
went
the
feather
from
her
lay
on
her
neck
her
eyes
were
the
colour
of
her
mouth
was
red
as
any
rose
she
had
too
so
sweet
and
natural
a
manner
that
polly
was
soon
chatting
frankly
about
herself
and
her
life
glendinning
listening
with
her
face
pressed
to
the
of
trotty
hair
when
she
rose
she
clasped
both
polly
hands
in
hers
you
dear
little
woman
may
i
kiss
you
i
am
ever
so
much
older
than
you
i
am
eighteen
said
polly
and
i
on
the
shady
side
of
they
laughed
and
kissed
i
shall
ask
your
husband
to
bring
you
out
to
see
me
and
take
no
refusal
au
revoir
and
riding
off
she
turned
in
the
saddle
and
waved
her
hand
for
all
her
pleasurable
excitement
polly
did
not
let
the
grass
grow
under
her
feet
there
being
still
no
sign
of
richard
he
had
gone
to
soldiers
hill
to
extract
a
rusty
nail
from
a
child
foot
ellen
was
sent
to
summon
him
home
and
when
the
girl
returned
with
word
that
he
was
on
the
way
polly
dispatched
her
to
the
to
order
the
horse
to
be
got
ready
richard
took
the
news
coolly
did
she
say
what
the
matter
was
no
she
had
and
polly
had
not
liked
to
ask
her
it
could
surely
be
nothing
very
serious
or
she
would
have
mentioned
it
h
then
it
probably
as
i
thought
glendinning
failing
is
well
known
only
the
other
day
i
heard
that
more
than
one
medical
man
had
declined
to
have
anything
further
to
do
with
the
case
it
a
long
way
out
and
fees
are
not
always
forthcoming
he
does
ask
for
a
doctor
and
womanlike
she
forgets
to
pay
the
bills
i
suppose
they
think
they
try
a
greenhorn
this
time
pressed
by
polly
who
was
curious
to
learn
everything
about
her
new
friend
he
answered
i
should
be
sorry
to
tell
you
my
dear
how
many
bottles
of
brandy
it
is
glendinning
boast
he
can
empty
in
a
week
drink
oh
richard
how
terrible
and
that
pretty
pretty
woman
cried
polly
and
drove
her
thoughts
backwards
she
had
seen
no
hint
of
tragedy
in
her
caller
lovely
face
however
she
did
not
wait
to
ponder
but
asked
a
little
anxiously
but
you
go
dear
wo
you
go
of
course
i
shall
beggars
ca
be
choosers
besides
you
know
you
might
be
able
to
do
something
where
other
people
have
failed
mahony
rode
out
across
the
flat
for
a
couple
of
miles
his
route
was
one
with
the
melbourne
road
on
which
plied
the
usual
motley
traffic
then
branching
off
at
right
angles
it
dived
into
the
bush
in
this
case
a
scantly
wooded
uneven
plain
burnt
and
hard
as
iron
here
went
no
one
but
himself
he
and
the
mare
were
the
sole
living
creatures
in
what
for
its
stillness
might
have
been
a
painted
landscape
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
the
weeping
foliage
of
the
gums
nor
was
there
any
to
rustle
the
leaves
or
peck
or
chirrup
did
he
draw
rein
the
silence
was
so
intense
that
he
could
almost
hear
it
on
striking
the
outlying
boundary
of
dandaloo
he
dismounted
to
slip
a
rail
after
that
he
was
in
and
out
of
the
saddle
his
way
leading
through
numerous
gateless
paddocks
before
it
brought
him
up
to
the
homestead
this
a
low
white
wooden
building
overspread
by
a
broad
verandah
from
a
distance
it
looked
like
an
elongated
mushroom
stood
on
a
hill
at
the
end
the
road
had
run
alongside
a
fruit
and
but
the
hillside
itself
except
for
a
gravelled
walk
in
front
of
the
house
was
uncultivated
was
given
over
to
dead
thistles
and
brown
weeds
fastening
his
bridle
to
a
post
mahony
unstrapped
his
bag
of
necessaries
and
stepped
on
to
the
verandah
a
row
of
french
windows
stood
open
but
flexible
green
hid
the
rooms
from
view
the
front
door
was
a
french
window
too
differing
from
the
rest
only
in
its
size
there
was
neither
bell
nor
knocker
while
he
was
rapping
with
the
knuckles
on
the
panel
one
of
the
blinds
was
pushed
aside
and
glendinning
came
out
she
was
still
in
hat
and
had
herself
she
said
reached
home
but
half
an
hour
ago
summoning
a
to
attend
to
the
horse
she
raised
a
blind
and
ushered
mahony
into
the
where
she
had
been
sitting
at
lunch
alone
at
the
head
of
a
large
table
a
chinaman
brought
fresh
plates
and
mahony
was
invited
to
draw
up
his
chair
he
had
an
appetite
after
his
ride
the
room
was
cool
and
dark
there
were
no
flies
throughout
the
meal
the
lady
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
talk
the
graceful
chitchat
that
sits
so
well
on
pretty
lips
she
spoke
of
the
coming
races
of
the
last
government
house
ball
of
the
untimely
death
of
governor
hotham
to
mahony
she
instinctively
turned
a
different
side
out
from
that
which
had
captured
polly
with
all
her
ease
there
was
a
womanly
deference
in
her
manner
a
readiness
to
be
swayed
to
stand
corrected
the
set
off
her
figure
and
her
delicate
features
were
perfectly
chiselled
though
she
be
florid
before
she
forty
some
juicy
nectarines
finished
she
pushed
back
her
chair
and
now
doctor
will
you
come
and
see
your
patient
mahony
followed
her
down
a
broad
bare
passage
a
number
of
rooms
opened
off
it
but
instead
of
entering
one
of
these
she
led
him
out
to
a
back
verandah
here
before
a
small
door
she
listened
with
bent
head
then
turned
the
handle
and
went
in
the
room
was
so
dark
that
mahony
could
see
nothing
gradually
he
made
out
a
figure
lying
on
a
a
watcher
sat
at
the
bedside
the
atmosphere
was
more
than
close
smelt
rank
and
sour
his
first
request
was
for
light
and
air
it
was
the
wreck
of
a
fine
man
that
lay
there
strapped
over
the
chest
bound
hand
and
foot
to
the
framework
of
the
bed
the
forehead
on
which
the
hair
had
receded
to
a
few
mean
grey
wisps
was
high
and
domed
the
features
were
straight
with
plenty
of
bone
in
them
the
shoulders
broad
the
arms
long
the
skin
of
the
face
had
gone
a
mahogany
brown
from
exposure
and
a
score
of
deep
wrinkles
ran
out
from
the
corners
of
the
closed
lids
mahony
untied
the
dirty
towels
that
formed
the
bandages
they
had
cut
ridges
in
the
limbs
they
confined
and
took
one
of
the
heavy
wrists
in
his
hand
how
long
has
he
lain
like
this
he
asked
as
he
returned
the
arm
to
its
place
how
long
is
it
saunderson
asked
glendinning
she
had
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
her
skirts
overflowed
the
floor
the
watcher
guessed
it
would
be
since
about
the
same
time
yesterday
was
he
unusually
violent
on
this
occasion
for
i
presume
such
attacks
are
not
uncommon
with
him
continued
mahony
who
had
meanwhile
made
a
superficial
examination
of
the
sick
man
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
are
only
too
common
doctor
replied
the
was
he
worse
than
usual
this
time
saunderson
she
turned
again
to
the
man
at
which
fresh
proof
of
her
want
of
knowledge
mahony
mentally
raised
his
eyebrows
to
say
trewth
i
never
see
the
boss
so
bad
before
answered
saunderson
solemnly
grating
the
palms
of
the
big
red
hands
that
hung
down
between
his
knees
and
i
helped
him
through
the
jumps
once
it
my
opinion
it
would
ha
been
a
narrow
squeak
for
him
this
time
if
me
and
a
mate
had
nipped
in
and
got
these
bracelets
on
him
there
he
was
ravin
and
sweatin
and
cursin
his
head
off
grey
as
death
he
called
it
said
he
was
at
and
kept
hollerin
for
napkins
and
his
firesticks
poor
boss
it
was
hell
for
him
and
no
mistake
by
dint
of
questioning
mahony
elicited
the
fact
that
glendinning
had
been
unseated
by
a
young
horse
three
days
previously
at
the
time
no
heed
was
paid
to
the
trifling
accident
later
on
however
complaining
of
feeling
cold
and
unwell
he
went
to
bed
and
after
lying
wakeful
for
some
hours
was
seized
by
the
horrors
of
delirium
requesting
the
lady
to
leave
them
mahony
made
a
more
detailed
examination
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
there
was
internal
trouble
of
old
standing
rendered
acute
by
the
fall
aided
by
saunderson
he
worked
with
restoratives
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
the
end
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
coma
pass
over
into
a
natural
repose
well
he
through
this
time
but
i
wo
answer
for
the
next
he
said
and
looked
about
him
for
a
basin
in
which
to
wash
his
hands
ca
you
manage
to
keep
the
drink
from
him
or
at
least
to
limit
him
nay
the
almighty
himself
could
do
that
gave
back
saunderson
bringing
forward
soap
and
a
tin
dish
how
does
it
come
that
he
lies
in
a
place
like
this
asked
mahony
as
he
dried
his
hands
on
a
corner
of
the
least
dirty
towel
and
glanced
curiously
round
the
room
in
size
it
did
not
greatly
exceed
that
of
a
was
in
a
state
of
squalid
disorder
besides
a
deal
table
and
a
couple
of
chairs
its
main
contents
were
rows
and
piles
of
old
magazines
the
thick
brown
dust
on
which
showed
that
they
had
not
been
moved
for
months
or
even
years
the
whitewashed
walls
were
and
dotted
with
millions
of
the
dried
corpses
of
squashed
spiders
formed
large
black
patches
all
four
corners
of
the
ceiling
were
festooned
with
cobwebs
saunderson
shrugged
his
shoulders
this
was
his
den
when
he
first
was
manager
here
in
old
morrison
time
and
he
stuck
to
it
ever
since
he
shuts
himself
up
in
here
and
wo
have
a
female
cross
the
threshold
nor
yet
madam
g
herself
having
given
final
instructions
mahony
went
out
to
rejoin
the
lady
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
husband
is
in
a
very
precarious
condition
do
you
mean
doctor
he
wo
live
long
she
had
evidently
been
lying
down
one
side
of
her
face
was
flushed
and
marked
crying
too
or
he
was
much
mistaken
her
lids
were
her
shapely
features
swollen
ah
you
ask
too
much
of
me
i
am
only
a
woman
i
have
no
influence
over
him
she
said
sadly
and
shook
her
head
what
is
his
age
he
is
mahony
had
put
him
down
for
at
least
ten
years
older
and
said
so
but
the
lady
was
not
listening
she
fidgeted
with
her
handkerchief
looked
uneasy
seemed
to
be
in
debate
with
herself
finally
she
said
aloud
yes
i
will
and
to
him
doctor
would
you
come
with
me
a
moment
this
time
she
conducted
him
to
a
bedchamber
off
which
gave
a
smaller
room
containing
a
little
draped
in
dimity
with
a
vague
gesture
in
the
direction
of
the
bed
she
sank
on
a
chair
beside
the
door
drawing
the
curtains
mahony
discovered
a
boy
of
some
eight
or
nine
years
old
he
lay
with
his
head
far
back
his
mouth
wide
open
apparently
fast
asleep
but
the
doctor
eye
was
quick
to
see
that
it
was
no
natural
sleep
good
god
who
is
responsible
for
this
glendinning
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
i
have
never
told
any
one
before
she
wept
the
shame
of
it
doctor
is
more
than
i
can
bear
who
is
the
blackguard
come
answer
me
if
you
please
oh
doctor
do
scold
me
i
am
so
unhappy
the
pretty
face
puckered
and
creased
the
full
bosom
heaved
he
is
all
i
have
and
such
a
bright
clever
little
fellow
you
will
cure
him
for
me
you
how
often
has
it
happened
i
do
know
about
five
or
six
times
i
think
perhaps
more
there
a
place
not
far
from
here
where
he
can
get
it
an
old
my
husband
dismissed
once
in
a
fit
of
temper
he
has
oh
such
a
temper
eddy
saddles
his
pony
and
rides
out
there
if
he
not
watched
and
then
then
they
bring
him
back
like
this
but
who
supplies
him
with
money
money
oh
but
doctor
he
ca
be
kept
without
he
has
always
had
as
much
as
he
no
it
is
all
my
doing
and
now
she
broke
out
in
one
of
those
shameless
confessions
from
which
the
medical
adviser
is
never
safe
he
hates
me
he
is
only
happy
if
he
can
hurt
me
and
humiliate
me
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
him
the
sooner
he
dies
the
better
compose
yourself
my
dear
lady
later
you
may
regret
such
hasty
and
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
child
come
speak
out
it
will
be
a
relief
to
you
to
tell
me
you
are
so
kind
doctor
she
sobbed
and
drank
with
hysterical
gurglings
the
glass
of
water
mahony
poured
out
for
her
yes
i
will
tell
you
everything
it
began
years
ago
when
eddy
was
only
a
tot
in
jumpers
it
used
to
amuse
my
husband
to
see
him
toss
off
a
glass
of
wine
like
a
person
and
it
was
comical
when
he
sipped
it
and
smacked
his
lips
but
then
he
grew
to
like
it
and
to
ask
for
it
and
be
cross
when
he
was
refused
and
then
then
he
learnt
how
to
get
it
for
himself
and
when
his
father
saw
i
was
upset
about
it
he
egged
him
on
gave
it
to
him
on
the
oh
he
is
a
bad
man
doctor
a
bad
cruel
man
he
says
such
wicked
things
too
he
does
believe
in
god
or
that
it
is
wrong
to
take
one
own
life
and
he
says
he
never
wanted
children
he
jeers
at
me
because
i
am
fond
of
eddy
and
because
i
go
to
church
when
i
can
and
says
oh
i
know
i
am
not
clever
but
i
am
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
he
makes
me
out
to
be
he
speaks
to
me
as
if
i
were
the
dirt
under
his
feet
he
ca
bear
the
sight
of
me
i
have
heard
him
curse
the
day
he
first
saw
me
and
so
he
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
come
between
my
boy
and
me
in
any
way
he
can
mahony
led
the
weeping
woman
back
to
the
there
he
sat
long
patiently
listening
and
advising
sat
till
glendinning
had
dried
her
eyes
and
was
her
charming
self
once
more
the
gist
of
what
he
said
was
the
boy
must
be
removed
from
home
at
once
and
placed
in
strict
yet
kind
hands
here
however
he
ran
up
against
a
weak
maternal
obstinacy
oh
but
i
could
part
from
eddy
he
is
all
i
have
and
so
devoted
to
his
mammy
as
mahony
insisted
she
looked
the
picture
of
helplessness
but
i
should
have
no
idea
how
to
set
about
it
and
my
husband
would
put
every
possible
obstacle
in
the
way
with
your
permission
i
will
arrange
the
matter
myself
oh
how
kind
you
are
cried
glendinning
again
but
mind
doctor
it
must
be
somewhere
where
eddy
will
lack
none
of
the
comforts
he
is
accustomed
to
and
where
his
poor
mammy
can
see
him
whenever
she
wishes
otherwise
he
will
fret
himself
mahony
promised
to
do
his
best
to
satisfy
her
and
declining
very
curtly
the
wine
she
pressed
on
him
went
out
to
mount
his
horse
which
had
been
brought
round
following
him
on
to
the
verandah
glendinning
became
once
more
the
pretty
woman
frankly
concerned
for
her
appearance
i
do
know
how
i
look
i
sure
she
said
apologetically
and
raised
both
hands
to
her
hair
now
i
will
go
and
rest
for
an
hour
there
is
to
be
opossuming
and
a
moonlight
picnic
at
warraluen
catching
mahony
eye
fixed
on
her
with
a
meaning
emphasis
she
changed
colour
i
can
not
sit
at
home
and
think
doctor
i
must
distract
myself
or
i
should
go
mad
when
he
was
in
the
saddle
she
showed
him
her
dimples
again
and
her
small
even
teeth
i
want
you
to
bring
your
wife
to
see
me
next
time
you
come
she
sad
patting
the
horse
neck
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
her
a
sweet
little
woman
but
mahony
jogging
downhill
said
to
himself
he
would
think
twice
before
introducing
polly
there
his
young
wife
sunny
girlish
outlook
should
not
with
his
consent
be
clouded
by
a
knowledge
of
the
sordid
things
this
material
prosperity
hid
from
view
a
whited
sepulchre
seemed
to
him
now
the
richly
appointed
house
the
gardens
the
acres
on
acres
of
good
a
fair
outside
when
within
all
was
foul
he
called
to
mind
what
he
knew
by
hearsay
of
the
owner
glendinning
was
one
of
the
pioneer
squatters
of
the
district
had
held
the
run
for
close
on
fifteen
years
nowadays
when
the
land
round
was
entirely
taken
up
and
a
place
like
ballarat
stood
within
it
was
hard
to
imagine
the
awful
solitude
to
which
the
early
settlers
had
been
condemned
then
with
his
next
neighbour
miles
and
miles
away
melbourne
the
nearest
town
a
couple
of
days
ride
through
trackless
bush
a
man
was
a
veritable
prisoner
in
this
desert
of
paddocks
with
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
but
rough
and
nothing
to
occupy
his
mind
but
the
damage
done
by
summer
droughts
and
winter
floods
no
support
or
comradeship
in
the
wife
either
this
poor
pretty
foolish
little
woman
with
the
brains
of
a
pigeon
glendinning
had
the
name
of
being
intelligent
was
it
under
these
circumstances
matter
for
wonder
that
he
should
seek
to
drown
doubts
memories
inevitable
regrets
should
be
led
on
to
the
bitter
discovery
that
forgetfulness
alone
rendered
life
endurable
yes
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
dead
stillness
of
the
melancholy
bush
in
the
harsh
merciless
sunlight
of
the
late
afternoon
a
couple
of
miles
out
his
horse
cast
a
shoe
and
it
was
evening
before
he
reached
home
polly
was
watching
for
him
on
the
doorstep
in
a
twitter
lest
some
accident
had
happened
or
he
had
had
a
brush
with
bushrangers
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
dear
was
her
greeting
he
had
been
twice
sent
for
to
the
flat
to
attend
a
woman
in
and
with
barely
time
to
wash
the
worst
of
the
ride
dust
off
him
he
had
to
pick
up
his
bag
and
hurry
away
chapter
v
a
very
man
with
perfect
manners
and
beautiful
hands
her
head
bent
over
her
sewing
polly
repeated
these
words
to
herself
with
a
happy
little
smile
they
had
been
told
her
in
confidence
by
glendinning
and
had
been
said
by
this
lady
best
friend
urquhart
of
yarangobilly
on
the
occasion
of
richard
second
call
at
dandaloo
he
had
been
requested
to
ride
to
the
neighbouring
station
to
visit
urquhart
who
was
in
delicate
health
and
of
course
polly
had
passed
the
flattering
opinion
on
for
though
she
was
rather
a
good
hand
at
keeping
a
secret
richard
declared
he
had
never
known
a
better
yet
that
secret
did
not
exist
or
up
till
now
had
not
existed
which
she
could
imagine
herself
keeping
from
him
for
the
past
few
weeks
these
two
ladies
had
vied
with
each
other
in
singing
richard
praises
and
in
making
much
of
polly
the
second
time
glendinning
called
she
came
in
her
buggy
and
carried
off
polly
and
trotty
too
to
yarangobilly
where
there
was
a
nestful
of
little
ones
for
the
child
to
play
with
another
day
a
whole
brakeful
of
lively
people
drove
up
to
the
door
in
the
early
morning
and
insisted
on
polly
accompanying
them
just
as
she
was
to
the
racecourse
on
the
road
to
creswick
creek
and
everybody
was
so
kind
to
her
that
polly
heartily
enjoyed
herself
in
spite
of
her
plain
print
dress
she
won
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
piece
of
music
in
a
philippine
with
mr
urquhart
a
jolly
man
beside
whom
she
sat
on
the
coming
home
and
she
was
lucky
enough
to
have
on
one
of
the
winners
an
impromptu
dance
was
got
up
that
evening
by
the
merry
party
in
a
hall
in
the
township
and
polly
had
the
honour
of
a
turn
with
henry
ocock
who
was
most
affable
richard
also
looked
in
for
an
hour
towards
the
end
and
valsed
her
and
glendinning
round
polly
had
quite
lost
her
heart
to
her
new
friend
at
the
outset
richard
had
rather
frowned
on
the
intimacy
but
then
he
was
a
person
given
to
taking
unaccountable
antipathies
in
this
case
however
he
had
to
yield
for
not
only
did
a
deep
personal
liking
spring
up
between
the
two
women
but
a
wave
of
pity
swept
over
polly
blinding
her
to
more
subtle
considerations
before
glendinning
had
been
many
times
at
the
house
she
had
poured
out
all
her
troubles
to
polly
impelled
thereto
by
polly
quick
sympathy
and
warm
young
eyes
richard
had
purposely
given
his
wife
few
details
of
his
visits
to
dandaloo
but
glendinning
knew
no
such
scruples
and
cried
her
eyes
out
on
polly
shoulder
what
a
dreadful
man
the
husband
must
be
for
she
really
is
the
dearest
little
woman
richard
and
means
so
well
with
every
one
i
never
heard
her
say
a
sharp
or
unkind
well
not
very
clever
perhaps
but
everybody
ca
be
clever
can
they
and
she
good
which
is
better
the
only
thing
she
seems
a
bit
foolish
about
is
her
boy
i
afraid
she
never
consent
to
part
with
him
polly
said
this
to
prepare
her
husband
who
was
in
correspondence
on
the
subject
with
archdeacon
long
and
with
john
in
melbourne
richard
was
putting
himself
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
would
naturally
be
vexed
if
nothing
came
of
it
polly
paid
her
first
visit
to
dandaloo
with
considerable
trepidation
for
urquhart
who
herself
was
happily
married
although
it
was
true
her
merry
husband
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
little
too
fond
of
the
ladies
and
though
he
certainly
did
not
make
such
a
paying
concern
of
yarangobilly
as
glendinning
of
dandaloo
urquhart
had
whispered
to
polly
as
they
sat
chatting
on
the
verandah
such
a
dreadful
man
my
dear
a
perfect
brute
poor
little
agnes
it
is
wonderful
how
she
keeps
her
spirits
up
polly
however
was
in
honour
bound
to
admit
that
to
her
the
owner
of
dandaloo
had
appeared
anything
but
the
monster
report
made
him
out
to
be
he
was
perfectly
sober
the
day
she
was
there
and
did
not
touch
wine
at
luncheon
and
afterwards
he
had
been
most
kind
taking
her
with
him
on
a
quiet
little
mare
to
an
outlying
part
of
the
station
and
giving
her
several
hints
how
to
improve
her
seat
he
was
certainly
very
and
deeply
wrinkled
and
at
table
his
hand
shook
so
that
the
water
in
his
glass
ran
over
but
all
this
only
made
polly
feel
sorry
for
him
and
long
to
help
him
my
dear
you
are
favoured
i
never
knew
james
make
such
an
offer
before
whispered
glendinning
as
she
pinned
her
ample
round
her
friend
slim
hips
the
one
thing
about
him
that
disturbed
polly
was
his
manner
towards
his
wife
he
was
savagely
ironic
with
her
and
trampled
hobnailed
on
her
timid
opinions
but
then
agnes
did
know
how
to
treat
him
polly
soon
saw
that
she
was
nervous
and
fluttery
evasive
too
and
once
during
lunch
even
told
a
deliberate
fib
slight
as
was
her
acquaintance
with
him
polly
felt
sure
this
want
of
courage
must
displease
him
for
there
was
something
very
simple
and
direct
about
his
own
way
of
speaking
my
dear
why
do
you
stand
up
to
him
asked
little
polly
dearest
i
dare
not
if
you
knew
him
as
i
do
polly
he
terrifies
oh
what
a
lucky
little
woman
you
are
to
have
a
husband
like
yours
polly
had
recalled
these
words
that
very
morning
as
she
stood
to
watch
richard
ride
away
never
did
he
forget
to
kiss
her
or
to
turn
and
wave
to
her
at
the
foot
of
the
road
each
time
she
admired
afresh
the
figure
he
cut
on
horseback
he
was
so
tall
and
slender
and
sat
so
straight
in
his
saddle
now
too
he
had
yielded
to
her
persuasions
and
shaved
off
his
beard
and
his
moustache
and
were
like
his
hair
of
an
extreme
silky
blond
ever
since
the
day
of
their
first
meeting
at
beamish
family
hotel
polly
had
thought
her
husband
the
handsomest
man
in
the
world
and
the
best
as
well
he
had
his
peculiarities
of
course
but
so
had
every
husband
and
it
was
part
of
a
wife
duty
to
study
them
to
adapt
herself
to
them
or
to
endeavour
to
tone
them
down
and
now
came
these
older
wiser
ladies
and
confirmed
her
high
opinion
of
him
polly
beamed
with
happiness
at
this
juncture
and
registered
a
silent
vow
always
to
be
the
best
of
wives
not
like
but
here
she
tripped
and
coloured
on
the
threshold
of
her
thought
she
had
recently
been
the
recipient
of
a
very
distressing
confidence
one
too
which
she
was
not
at
liberty
to
share
even
with
richard
for
after
the
relief
of
a
confession
glendinning
had
implored
her
not
to
breathe
a
word
to
him
i
could
never
look
him
in
the
face
again
love
besides
the
affair
was
of
such
a
painful
nature
that
polly
felt
little
desire
to
draw
richard
into
it
it
was
bad
enough
that
she
herself
should
know
the
thing
was
this
once
when
polly
had
stayed
overnight
at
dandaloo
agnes
glendinning
in
a
sudden
fit
of
misery
had
owned
to
her
that
she
cared
for
another
person
more
than
for
her
own
husband
and
that
her
feelings
were
returned
shocked
beyond
measure
polly
tried
to
close
her
friend
lips
i
do
think
you
should
mention
any
names
agnes
she
cried
afterwards
my
dear
you
might
regret
it
but
glendinning
was
hungry
for
the
luxury
of
speech
not
even
to
louisa
urquhart
had
she
broken
silence
she
wept
and
that
for
the
sake
of
louisa
children
and
she
persisted
in
laying
her
heart
bare
and
here
certain
vague
suspicions
that
had
crossed
polly
mind
on
the
night
of
the
impromptu
ball
they
were
gone
again
in
an
instant
quick
as
thistledown
on
the
breeze
these
suddenly
returned
and
weighty
and
the
name
that
was
spoken
came
as
no
surprise
to
her
yes
it
was
henry
ocock
to
whom
poor
agnes
was
attached
there
had
been
a
mutual
avowal
of
affection
sobbed
the
latter
they
met
as
often
as
circumstances
permitted
polly
was
knowing
agnes
as
she
did
she
herself
could
not
believe
any
harm
of
her
but
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
what
other
people
richard
for
instance
would
say
did
they
get
wind
of
it
she
implored
her
friend
to
caution
she
ought
never
never
to
see
ocock
why
did
she
not
go
away
to
melbourne
for
a
time
and
why
had
he
come
to
ballarat
to
be
near
me
dearest
to
help
me
if
i
should
need
oh
you
ca
think
what
a
comfort
it
is
polly
to
feel
that
he
is
here
so
good
and
strong
and
clever
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
but
this
is
quite
quite
different
henry
does
not
expect
me
to
be
clever
too
does
not
want
me
to
be
he
prefers
me
as
i
am
he
dislikes
clever
women
would
never
marry
one
and
we
shall
marry
darling
some
day
when
henry
ocock
polly
tried
to
focus
everything
she
knew
of
him
all
her
fleeting
impressions
in
one
picture
and
failed
he
had
made
himself
very
agreeable
the
single
time
she
had
met
him
but
there
was
richard
opinion
of
him
richard
did
not
like
him
or
trust
him
he
thought
him
unscrupulous
in
business
cold
and
poor
poor
little
agnes
that
such
a
misfortune
should
befall
just
her
stranger
still
that
she
polly
should
be
mixed
up
in
it
she
had
of
course
always
known
from
books
that
such
things
did
happen
but
then
they
seemed
quite
different
and
very
far
away
her
thoughts
at
this
crisis
were
undeniably
woolly
but
the
gist
of
them
was
that
life
and
books
had
nothing
in
common
for
in
stories
the
woman
who
forgot
herself
was
always
a
bad
woman
whereas
not
the
harshest
critic
could
call
poor
agnes
bad
indeed
polly
felt
that
even
if
some
one
proved
to
her
that
her
friend
had
actually
done
wrong
she
would
not
on
that
account
be
able
to
stop
caring
for
her
or
feeling
sorry
for
her
it
was
all
very
uncomfortable
and
confusing
while
these
thoughts
came
and
went
she
half
sat
half
knelt
a
pair
of
scissors
in
her
hand
she
was
busy
cutting
out
a
dress
and
no
table
being
big
enough
for
the
purpose
had
stretched
the
material
on
the
parlour
floor
this
would
be
the
first
new
dress
she
had
had
since
her
marriage
and
it
was
high
time
considering
all
the
visiting
and
going
about
that
fell
to
her
lot
just
now
sara
had
sent
the
pattern
up
from
melbourne
and
john
hearing
what
was
in
the
wind
had
most
kindly
and
generously
made
her
a
present
of
the
silk
polly
hoped
she
would
not
bungle
it
in
the
cutting
but
skirts
were
growing
wider
and
wider
and
john
had
not
reckoned
with
quite
the
newest
fashion
steps
in
the
passage
made
her
note
subconsciously
that
ned
had
arrived
jerry
had
been
in
the
house
for
the
past
three
weeks
with
a
sprained
wrist
and
at
this
moment
her
younger
brother
himself
entered
the
room
trotty
throned
on
his
shoulder
picking
his
steps
round
the
sea
of
stuff
jerry
sat
down
and
lowered
trotty
to
his
knee
ned
grizzling
for
tea
polly
did
not
reply
she
was
laying
an
piece
of
paper
now
this
way
now
that
for
a
while
jerry
played
with
the
child
then
he
burst
out
i
say
poll
and
since
polly
paid
no
heed
to
his
apostrophe
richard
says
i
can
get
back
to
work
that
a
good
thing
answered
his
sister
with
an
air
of
abstraction
she
had
solved
her
puzzle
to
within
half
a
yard
jerry
cast
a
boyishly
imploring
glance
at
her
back
and
rubbed
his
chin
with
his
hand
poll
old
girl
i
say
would
you
put
in
a
word
for
me
with
richard
i
hanged
if
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
claim
i
sick
to
death
of
digging
at
this
polly
did
raise
her
head
to
regard
him
with
grave
eyes
what
tired
of
work
already
jerry
i
do
know
what
richard
will
say
to
that
i
sure
you
had
better
speak
to
him
yourself
again
jerry
rubbed
his
chin
that
just
it
what
so
beastly
hard
i
know
he
say
i
ought
to
stick
to
it
so
do
i
well
i
rather
groom
the
horse
than
that
but
think
how
pleased
you
were
at
first
jerry
ruefully
admitted
it
one
expects
to
dig
out
gold
like
spuds
while
the
real
thing
enough
to
give
you
the
blight
as
for
stopping
a
all
my
life
i
wo
do
it
i
might
just
as
well
go
home
and
work
in
a
lancashire
pit
but
ned
oh
ned
ned
walks
about
with
his
head
in
the
clouds
he
always
blowing
of
what
he
going
to
do
and
gets
his
steam
off
that
way
different
but
jerry
words
fell
on
deaf
ears
a
noise
in
the
next
room
was
engaging
polly
whole
attention
she
heard
a
burr
of
suppressed
laughter
a
scuffle
and
what
sounded
like
a
sharp
slap
jumping
up
she
went
to
the
door
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
ellen
whisk
out
of
the
ned
sat
in
an
armchair
with
his
feet
on
the
i
had
the
girl
bring
in
a
log
poll
he
said
and
looked
back
and
up
at
his
sister
with
his
cheery
smile
standing
behind
him
polly
laid
her
hand
on
his
hair
i
go
and
see
after
the
tea
ned
was
so
unconcerned
that
she
hesitated
to
put
a
question
in
the
kitchen
she
had
no
such
tender
scruples
nor
was
she
imposed
on
by
the
exaggerated
energy
with
which
ellen
bustled
about
what
was
that
noise
i
heard
in
the
just
now
she
demanded
noise
i
dunno
gave
back
the
girl
crossly
without
facing
her
nonsense
ellen
do
you
think
i
did
hear
oh
get
along
with
you
it
was
only
one
of
ned
jokes
and
going
on
her
knees
ellen
set
to
scrubbing
the
brick
floor
with
a
hiss
and
a
scratch
that
rendered
speech
impossible
polly
took
up
the
laden
and
carried
it
into
the
richard
had
come
home
and
the
four
drew
chairs
to
the
table
mahony
had
a
book
with
him
he
propped
it
open
against
the
and
snatched
sentences
as
he
ate
it
fell
to
ned
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
polly
was
distraite
to
the
point
of
going
wrong
in
her
sugars
jerry
uneasy
at
the
prospect
of
coming
in
conflict
with
his
whom
he
thought
the
world
of
ned
was
as
full
of
talk
as
an
egg
of
meat
the
theme
he
dwelt
longest
on
was
the
new
glory
that
lay
in
store
for
the
ballarat
diggings
at
present
these
were
under
a
cloud
the
alluvial
was
giving
out
and
the
costs
and
difficulties
of
boring
through
the
rock
seemed
insuperable
one
might
hear
the
opinion
freely
expressed
that
ballarat
day
as
premier
goldfield
was
done
ned
set
up
this
belief
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
demolishing
it
he
had
it
at
first
hand
that
great
companies
were
being
formed
to
carry
on
operations
these
would
reckon
their
areas
in
acres
instead
of
feet
would
sink
to
a
depth
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
raise
washdirt
in
hundreds
of
tons
per
day
one
such
company
indeed
had
already
sprung
into
existence
out
on
golden
point
and
now
was
the
time
to
nip
in
if
he
ned
had
the
brass
or
knew
anybody
who
lend
it
to
him
he
buy
up
all
the
shares
he
could
get
those
who
followed
his
lead
would
make
their
fortunes
i
say
richard
be
something
for
you
his
words
evoked
no
response
sorry
though
i
shall
be
thought
polly
dear
ned
had
better
not
come
to
the
house
so
often
in
future
i
wonder
if
i
need
tell
richard
why
jerry
was
on
pins
and
needles
and
even
put
trotty
ungently
from
him
richard
would
be
so
disgusted
by
blatherskite
that
he
would
have
no
patience
left
to
listen
to
him
mahony
kept
his
nose
to
his
book
as
a
matter
of
principle
he
made
a
rule
of
believing
on
an
average
about
the
half
of
what
ned
said
to
appear
to
pay
attention
to
him
would
spur
him
on
to
more
flagrant
d
hear
richard
now
your
chance
repeated
ned
not
to
be
done
a
very
different
thing
this
i
can
tell
you
from
running
round
dosing
people
for
the
collywobbles
i
know
men
who
are
raising
the
splosh
any
way
they
can
to
get
in
i
dare
say
there
never
been
any
lack
of
gamblers
on
ballarat
said
mahony
dryly
and
passed
his
cup
to
be
refilled
fool
was
ned
mental
retort
as
he
sliced
a
chunk
of
well
i
bet
you
feel
sore
some
day
you
did
take
my
advice
he
said
aloud
we
shall
see
my
lad
we
shall
see
replied
mahony
in
the
meantime
let
me
inform
you
i
can
make
good
use
of
every
penny
i
have
so
if
you
come
here
thinking
you
can
wheedle
something
out
of
me
mistaken
he
could
seldom
resist
tearing
the
veil
from
ned
gross
hints
and
impostures
oh
no
richard
dear
interpolated
polly
in
her
role
of
ned
answered
huffily
my
word
i
never
met
such
a
fellow
as
you
for
thinking
the
worst
of
people
the
thrust
went
home
mahony
clapped
his
book
to
you
lay
yourself
open
to
it
sir
if
i
wrong
i
beg
your
pardon
but
for
sake
ned
put
all
these
trashy
ideas
of
making
a
fortune
out
of
your
mind
digging
is
played
out
i
tell
you
decent
people
turned
their
backs
on
it
long
ago
that
what
i
think
too
threw
in
jerry
mahony
bit
his
lip
come
come
now
what
do
you
know
about
it
jerry
flushed
and
floundered
till
polly
came
to
his
aid
he
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
richard
he
hates
the
work
as
much
as
you
did
well
he
has
a
tongue
of
his
speak
for
yourself
my
boy
thus
encouraged
jerry
made
his
appeal
and
fearing
lest
richard
should
throw
him
into
the
same
category
as
ned
he
worded
it
very
tersely
mahony
who
had
never
given
much
heed
to
jerry
no
one
did
was
pleased
by
his
straightforward
air
still
he
did
not
know
what
could
be
done
for
him
and
said
so
here
polly
had
an
inspiration
but
i
think
i
do
i
remember
ocock
saying
to
me
the
other
day
he
must
take
another
boy
into
the
business
it
was
growing
so
the
fourth
this
will
make
i
do
know
if
suited
yet
but
even
if
he
is
he
may
have
heard
of
something
only
you
know
jerry
you
must
mind
what
it
is
after
tea
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
go
down
to
the
flat
with
you
and
ned
shall
come
too
she
added
with
a
consoling
glance
at
her
elder
brother
ned
had
extended
his
huff
to
his
second
slice
of
pie
which
lay
untouched
on
his
plate
somebody
has
always
got
something
up
her
sleeve
said
mahony
affectionately
when
polly
came
to
him
in
walking
costume
none
the
less
wife
i
should
be
surprised
if
those
brothers
of
yours
gave
us
some
trouble
before
we
done
with
them
chapter
vi
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
followed
as
he
rode
from
one
end
of
ballarat
to
the
other
from
yuille
swamp
in
the
west
as
far
east
as
the
ranges
and
gullies
of
little
bendigo
it
gradually
became
plain
to
mahony
that
ned
frothy
tales
had
some
body
in
them
after
all
the
character
of
the
diggings
was
changing
before
his
very
eyes
nowadays
except
on
an
outlying
muddy
flat
or
in
the
hands
of
the
retrograde
chinese
tubs
cradles
and
windlasses
were
rarely
to
be
met
with
and
began
to
dot
the
ground
here
and
there
a
tall
chimney
belched
smoke
beside
a
lofty
or
an
aerial
the
richest
gutters
were
found
to
take
their
rise
below
the
basaltic
deposits
the
difficulties
and
risks
of
had
now
to
be
faced
and
the
capitalist
so
long
held
at
bay
at
length
made
free
of
the
field
large
sums
of
money
were
being
subscribed
and
where
these
proved
insufficient
the
banks
stepped
into
the
breach
with
subsidies
on
mortgages
the
population
in
whose
veins
the
still
burned
plunged
by
wholesale
into
the
new
hazard
and
under
the
wooden
verandahs
of
bridge
street
a
motley
crew
of
jobbers
and
brokers
came
into
existence
who
would
demonstrate
to
you
a
la
ned
how
you
might
reap
a
fortune
from
a
claim
without
putting
in
an
hour
work
on
it
without
even
knowing
where
it
was
a
temptation
indeed
but
one
that
did
not
affect
him
mahony
let
the
reins
droop
on
his
horse
neck
and
the
animal
picked
its
way
among
the
impedimenta
of
the
bush
road
it
concerned
only
those
who
had
money
to
spare
months
too
must
go
by
before
from
even
the
most
promising
of
these
affairs
any
return
was
to
be
expected
as
for
him
there
still
came
days
when
he
had
not
a
note
to
his
name
it
had
been
a
delusion
to
suppose
that
in
accepting
offer
he
was
leaving
behind
him
despite
thrift
their
improved
style
of
life
cost
more
than
he
had
reckoned
the
patients
slow
to
come
were
slower
still
to
discharge
their
debts
moreover
he
had
not
guessed
how
heavily
the
quarterly
payments
of
interest
would
weigh
on
him
with
as
good
as
no
margin
with
the
fate
of
every
shilling
decided
beforehand
the
saving
up
of
thirty
odd
pounds
four
times
a
year
was
a
veritable
achievement
he
was
always
in
a
quake
lest
he
should
not
be
able
to
get
it
together
no
one
suspected
what
near
shaves
he
had
not
even
polly
the
last
time
hardly
bore
thinking
about
at
the
eleventh
hour
he
had
unexpectedly
found
himself
several
pounds
short
he
did
not
close
an
eye
all
night
and
got
up
in
the
morning
as
though
for
his
own
execution
then
fortune
favoured
him
a
butcher
his
hearty
what
yours
be
at
the
nearest
waved
aside
had
settled
his
bill
mahony
could
still
feel
the
sudden
lift
of
the
black
that
had
enveloped
him
the
sense
of
bodily
exhaustion
that
had
succeeded
to
the
intolerable
mental
strain
for
the
coming
he
was
better
prepared
if
that
was
nothing
out
of
the
way
happened
of
late
he
had
been
haunted
by
the
fear
of
illness
the
long
hours
in
the
saddle
did
not
suit
him
he
ought
to
have
a
buggy
and
a
second
horse
but
there
could
be
no
question
of
it
in
the
meantime
or
of
a
great
deal
else
besides
he
wanted
to
buy
polly
a
piano
for
instance
all
her
friends
had
pianos
and
she
played
and
sang
very
prettily
she
needed
more
dresses
and
bonnets
too
than
he
was
able
to
allow
her
as
well
as
a
change
to
the
seaside
in
the
summer
heat
the
first
spare
money
he
had
should
go
towards
one
or
the
other
he
loved
to
give
polly
pleasure
never
was
such
a
contented
little
soul
as
she
and
well
for
him
that
it
was
so
to
have
had
a
complaining
even
an
impatient
wife
at
his
side
just
now
would
have
been
unbearable
but
polly
did
not
know
what
impatience
meant
her
sunny
temper
her
fixed
resolve
to
make
the
best
of
everything
was
not
to
be
shaken
well
comforts
galore
should
be
hers
some
day
he
hoped
the
practice
was
shaping
satisfactorily
his
attendance
at
dandaloo
had
proved
a
key
to
many
doors
folk
of
the
glendinnings
and
urquharts
standing
could
make
a
reputation
or
mar
it
as
they
chose
it
had
got
abroad
he
knew
that
at
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
he
was
sent
for
he
could
be
relied
on
to
be
sober
and
that
unfortunately
was
not
always
the
case
with
some
of
his
colleagues
in
addition
his
showed
signs
of
waking
up
to
his
existence
he
had
been
called
in
lately
to
a
couple
of
consultations
and
the
doyen
of
the
profession
on
ballarat
old
munce
himself
had
praised
his
handling
of
a
difficult
case
of
version
the
distances
to
be
covered
that
was
what
made
the
work
stiff
and
he
could
not
afford
to
neglect
a
single
summons
no
matter
where
it
led
him
still
he
would
not
have
grumbled
had
only
the
money
not
been
so
hard
to
get
in
but
the
fifty
thousand
odd
souls
on
ballarat
formed
even
yet
anything
but
a
stable
population
a
patient
you
attended
one
day
might
be
gone
the
next
and
gone
where
no
bill
could
reach
him
or
he
had
been
sold
off
at
public
auction
or
his
wooden
shanty
had
gone
up
in
a
flare
hardly
a
night
passed
without
a
fire
somewhere
in
these
and
like
accidents
the
unfortunate
doctor
might
whistle
for
his
fee
it
seldom
happened
nowadays
that
he
was
paid
in
cash
money
was
growing
as
scarce
here
as
anywhere
else
sometimes
it
was
true
he
might
have
pocketed
his
fee
on
the
spot
had
he
cared
to
ask
for
it
but
the
presenting
of
his
palm
professionally
was
a
gesture
that
was
denied
him
and
this
drove
from
people
minds
the
thought
that
he
might
be
in
actual
need
of
money
afterwards
he
sat
at
home
and
racked
his
brains
how
to
pay
butcher
and
grocer
others
of
the
fraternity
were
by
no
means
so
nice
he
knew
of
some
who
would
not
stir
a
yard
unless
their
fee
was
planked
down
before
them
old
stagers
these
who
at
one
time
had
been
badly
bitten
and
were
now
grown
cynically
distrustful
or
tired
and
indeed
who
could
blame
a
man
for
hesitating
of
a
night
in
the
winter
rains
or
on
a
blazing
summer
day
whether
or
no
he
should
set
out
on
a
ride
for
which
he
might
never
see
the
ghost
of
a
remuneration
reflecting
thus
mahony
caught
at
a
couple
of
hard
spicy
leaves
to
chew
as
he
went
the
gums
on
which
the
old
bark
hung
in
ribbons
were
in
flower
by
now
and
bore
feathery
yellow
blossoms
side
by
side
with
nutty
capsules
his
horse
had
been
ambling
forward
unpressed
now
it
laid
its
ears
flat
and
a
minute
later
its
slower
senses
caught
the
of
a
second
set
of
hoofs
the
noise
of
wheels
mahony
had
reached
a
place
where
two
roads
joined
and
saw
a
covered
buggy
approaching
he
drew
rein
and
waited
the
occupant
of
the
vehicle
had
wound
the
reins
round
the
empty
and
left
it
to
the
sagacity
of
his
horse
to
keep
the
familiar
track
while
he
dozed
head
on
breast
in
the
corner
the
animal
halted
of
itself
on
coming
up
with
its
fellow
and
archdeacon
long
opened
his
eyes
ah
to
you
doctor
yes
as
you
see
enjoying
a
little
nap
i
was
out
early
he
got
down
from
the
buggy
and
with
bent
knees
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
stretched
the
creased
cloth
of
his
trousers
where
this
had
cut
into
his
flesh
he
was
a
big
brawny
handsome
man
with
a
massive
nose
a
cloven
chin
and
the
most
companionable
smile
in
the
world
as
he
stood
he
touched
here
a
strap
there
a
buckle
on
the
harness
of
his
chestnut
a
trotter
with
which
he
often
made
a
match
and
affectionately
clapped
the
neck
of
mahony
bay
he
could
not
keep
his
hands
off
a
horse
by
choice
he
was
his
own
stableman
and
in
earlier
life
had
been
a
rider
now
increasing
weight
led
him
to
prefer
buggy
to
saddle
but
his
recklessness
had
not
diminished
with
the
reins
in
his
left
hand
he
would
run
his
light
trap
up
any
wooded
hill
and
down
the
other
side
just
as
in
his
days
he
had
set
it
at
felled
trees
and
if
rumour
spoke
true
mahony
admired
the
splendid
vitality
of
the
man
as
well
as
the
indestructible
optimism
that
bore
him
triumphantly
through
all
the
hardships
of
a
colonial
ministry
no
sick
bed
was
too
remote
for
long
no
sinner
sunk
too
low
to
be
helped
to
his
feet
the
leprous
chinaman
doomed
to
an
unending
isolation
the
drunken
paddy
the
degraded
white
woman
each
came
in
for
a
share
of
his
benevolence
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
visiting
the
outcasts
and
outposts
beating
up
the
unbaptised
the
unconfirmed
the
unwed
but
his
church
did
not
suffer
he
had
always
some
fresh
scheme
for
this
on
hand
either
he
was
getting
up
a
to
raise
money
for
an
organ
or
a
series
of
towards
funds
for
a
chancel
or
he
was
training
with
his
choir
for
a
sacred
concert
there
was
a
boyish
streak
in
him
too
he
would
enter
into
the
joys
of
the
annual
picnic
with
a
zest
equal
to
the
children
own
leading
the
way
in
at
and
in
doctrine
he
struck
a
happy
mean
between
practices
and
ritualism
preaching
short
spirited
sermons
to
which
even
languid
christians
could
listen
without
tedium
and
on
a
evening
he
would
take
a
hand
at
a
rubber
of
whist
or
ecarte
and
not
for
love
or
play
a
sound
game
of
chess
a
man
too
who
refusing
to
be
bound
by
the
letter
of
the
articles
extended
his
charity
even
to
persons
of
the
popish
faith
in
short
he
was
one
of
the
few
to
whom
mahony
could
speak
of
his
own
haphazard
efforts
at
criticising
the
pentateuch
the
archdeacon
was
wont
to
respond
with
his
genial
smile
ah
it
all
very
well
for
you
doctor
you
a
free
lance
i
am
constrained
by
my
and
frankly
for
the
rest
of
us
that
kind
of
too
well
too
disturbing
especially
when
we
have
nothing
better
to
put
in
its
place
doctor
and
parson
the
latter
considerably
over
six
feet
made
mahony
who
was
tall
enough
look
short
and
doubly
slender
walked
side
by
side
for
nearly
a
mile
flitting
from
topic
to
topic
the
rivalry
that
prevailed
between
ballarats
east
and
west
the
seditious
uprising
in
india
where
both
had
relatives
the
recent
rains
the
prospects
for
grazing
the
last
theme
brought
them
round
to
dandaloo
and
its
unhappy
owner
the
archdeacon
expressed
the
outsider
surprise
at
the
strength
of
glendinning
constitution
and
the
lively
popular
sympathy
that
was
felt
for
his
wife
one
heart
aches
for
the
poor
little
lady
struggling
to
bear
up
as
though
nothing
were
the
matter
between
ourselves
doctor
and
long
took
off
his
straw
hat
to
let
the
air
play
round
his
head
between
ourselves
it
a
thousand
pities
he
does
just
pop
off
the
hooks
in
one
of
his
bouts
or
that
some
of
you
medical
gentlemen
do
use
your
knowledge
to
help
things
on
he
let
out
his
great
hearty
laugh
as
he
spoke
and
his
involuntary
stiffening
went
unnoticed
but
on
mahony
voicing
his
attitude
with
and
his
immortal
soul
sir
is
it
the
church
duty
to
hope
for
a
miracle
just
as
it
is
ours
to
keep
the
vital
spark
going
he
made
haste
to
take
the
edge
off
his
words
now
now
doctor
only
my
fun
our
duty
is
i
trust
plain
to
us
both
it
was
even
easier
to
soothe
than
to
ruffle
mahony
remember
me
very
kindly
to
long
will
you
he
said
as
the
archdeacon
prepared
to
climb
into
his
buggy
but
tell
her
too
i
owe
her
a
grudge
just
now
my
wife
so
lost
in
flannel
and
brown
holland
that
i
ca
get
a
word
out
of
her
and
mine
does
know
where
she
be
with
this
bazaar
if
it
for
mrs
mahony
long
was
husband
to
a
dot
of
a
woman
who
having
borne
him
half
a
dozen
children
of
his
own
feature
and
build
now
worked
as
parish
clerk
and
district
visitor
rolled
in
one
driving
about
in
sunbonnet
and
behind
a
pair
of
cream
ponies
tiny
resolute
with
little
of
her
large
tolerance
but
an
energy
that
outdid
his
own
and
made
her
an
object
of
both
fear
and
respect
and
that
reminds
me
over
at
the
by
spring
hill
i
met
your
young
and
he
told
me
if
i
ran
across
you
to
ask
you
to
hurry
home
your
wife
has
some
surprise
or
other
in
store
for
you
no
nothing
unpleasant
rather
the
reverse
i
believe
but
i
was
to
say
more
well
doctor
to
you
mahony
smiled
nodded
and
went
on
his
way
polly
surprises
were
usually
simple
and
transparent
things
some
one
would
have
made
them
a
present
of
a
or
a
and
polly
knowing
his
relish
for
a
savoury
morsel
did
not
wish
it
to
be
overdone
she
had
sent
similar
chance
calls
out
after
him
before
now
when
having
seen
his
horse
rubbed
down
he
reached
home
he
found
her
on
the
doorstep
watching
for
him
she
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
had
those
peculiar
in
them
which
led
him
jokingly
to
exhort
her
to
caution
lest
the
sparks
should
set
the
house
on
fire
well
what
is
it
pussy
he
inquired
as
he
laid
his
bag
down
and
hung
up
his
what
my
little
got
up
her
sleeve
good
lord
polly
i
tired
polly
was
smiling
roguishly
are
you
going
into
the
surgery
richard
she
asked
seeing
him
heading
for
the
aha
so
that
it
said
he
and
obediently
turned
the
handle
polly
had
on
occasion
taken
advantage
of
his
absence
to
introduce
some
new
comfort
or
decoration
in
his
room
the
blind
had
been
let
down
he
was
still
blinking
in
the
when
a
figure
sprang
out
from
behind
the
door
barging
heavily
against
him
and
a
loud
voice
shouted
boh
you
old
boh
to
a
goose
displeased
at
such
horseplay
mahony
stepped
sharply
back
his
first
thought
was
of
ned
having
unexpectedly
returned
from
mount
ararat
then
recognising
the
voice
he
exclaimed
incredulously
you
dickybird
you
dick
old
man
i
say
dick
yes
it
me
right
enough
and
not
my
ghost
the
old
bad
egg
come
back
to
roost
the
blind
was
raised
and
the
friends
who
had
last
met
in
the
dingy
bush
hut
on
the
night
of
the
stockade
stood
face
to
face
and
now
ensued
a
babel
of
greeting
a
quick
fire
of
question
and
answer
the
two
voices
going
in
and
out
and
round
each
other
singly
and
together
like
the
voices
in
a
duet
tears
rose
to
polly
eyes
as
she
listened
it
made
her
heart
glow
to
see
richard
so
glad
but
when
forgetting
her
presence
purdy
cried
and
i
must
confess
dick
i
took
a
kiss
from
polly
gad
old
man
how
she
come
on
polly
hastily
retired
to
the
kitchen
at
table
the
same
high
spirits
prevailed
it
did
not
often
happen
that
richard
was
brought
out
of
his
shell
like
this
thought
polly
gratefully
and
heaped
her
visitor
plate
to
the
brim
his
first
hunger
stilled
purdy
fell
to
giving
a
slapdash
account
of
his
experiences
he
kept
to
no
orderly
sequence
but
threw
them
out
just
as
they
occurred
to
him
a
rub
with
bushrangers
in
the
black
forest
his
adventures
as
a
drover
in
the
mildura
the
trials
of
a
week
he
had
spent
in
a
establishment
on
the
murray
where
the
stink
wa
so
foul
you
two
that
i
vomited
like
a
dog
every
day
under
the
force
of
this
odyssey
husband
and
wife
gradually
dropped
into
silence
which
they
broke
only
by
single
words
of
astonishment
and
sympathy
while
the
child
trotty
spooned
in
her
pudding
without
seeing
it
her
round
solemn
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
on
this
new
uncle
who
was
like
a
wonderful
come
alive
in
mahony
feelings
for
purdy
at
this
moment
there
was
none
of
the
old
intolerant
superiority
he
had
been
dependent
for
so
long
on
a
mere
surface
acquaintance
with
his
fellows
that
he
now
felt
to
the
full
how
precious
the
tie
was
that
bound
him
to
purdy
here
came
one
for
whom
he
was
not
alone
the
reserved
struggling
practitioner
the
rather
moody
man
advancing
to
but
also
the
dick
of
his
boyhood
and
early
youth
he
had
often
imagined
the
satisfaction
it
would
be
to
confide
his
troubles
to
purdy
compared
however
with
the
hardships
the
latter
had
undergone
these
seemed
of
small
importance
and
dinner
passed
without
any
allusion
to
his
own
affairs
and
now
the
chances
of
his
speaking
out
were
slight
he
could
have
been
entirely
frank
only
under
the
first
stimulus
of
meeting
even
when
they
rose
from
the
table
purdy
continued
to
hold
the
stage
for
he
had
turned
up
with
hardly
a
shirt
to
his
back
and
had
to
be
rigged
out
afresh
from
mahony
wardrobe
it
was
decided
that
he
should
remain
their
guest
in
the
meantime
also
that
mahony
should
call
on
his
behalf
on
the
commissioner
of
police
and
put
in
a
good
word
for
him
for
purdy
had
come
back
with
the
idea
of
seeking
a
job
in
the
ballarat
mounted
force
when
mahony
could
no
longer
put
off
starting
on
his
afternoon
round
purdy
went
with
him
to
the
limping
briskly
at
his
side
on
the
way
he
exclaimed
aloud
at
the
marvellous
changes
that
had
taken
place
since
he
was
last
in
the
township
there
were
half
a
dozen
in
sturt
street
by
this
time
the
gas
being
distilled
from
a
mixture
of
oil
and
one
would
credit
it
if
one
did
see
it
with
one
own
peepers
he
cried
repeatedly
bringing
up
short
before
the
windows
of
the
shops
the
many
handsome
verandahed
hotels
the
granite
front
of
christ
church
and
from
what
i
hear
dick
now
companies
have
jumped
the
claims
and
are
in
earnest
fortunes
be
made
like
one
but
on
getting
home
again
he
sat
down
in
front
of
polly
and
said
with
a
businesslike
air
and
now
tell
me
all
about
old
dick
you
know
poll
he
such
an
odd
fish
if
he
himself
does
offer
to
uncork
somehow
one
ca
just
pump
him
and
i
want
to
know
everything
that
concerns
him
from
a
to
z
polly
could
not
hold
out
against
this
affectionate
curiosity
entrenching
her
needle
in
its
stuff
she
put
her
work
away
and
complied
and
soon
to
her
own
satisfaction
for
the
first
time
in
her
married
life
she
was
led
to
discuss
her
husband
ways
and
actions
with
another
and
to
her
amazement
she
found
that
it
was
easier
to
talk
to
purdy
about
richard
than
to
richard
himself
purdy
and
she
saw
things
in
the
same
light
no
rigmarole
of
explanation
was
necessary
now
with
richard
it
was
not
so
in
conversation
with
him
one
constantly
felt
that
he
was
not
speaking
out
or
to
put
it
more
plainly
that
he
was
going
on
meanwhile
with
his
own
very
different
thoughts
and
behind
what
he
did
say
there
was
sure
to
lurk
some
imaginary
scruple
some
rather
delicacy
of
feeling
which
it
was
hard
to
get
at
and
harder
still
to
understand
chapter
vii
summer
had
come
round
again
and
the
motionless
white
heat
of
december
lay
heavy
on
the
place
the
low
little
houses
seemed
to
cower
beneath
it
and
the
smoke
from
their
chimneys
drew
black
perpendicular
lines
on
the
pale
sky
if
it
was
a
misery
at
this
season
to
traverse
the
blazing
dusty
roads
it
was
almost
worse
to
be
within
doors
where
the
thin
wooden
walls
were
powerless
to
keep
out
the
heat
and
flies
and
mosquitoes
raged
in
chorus
nevertheless
determined
christmas
preparations
went
on
in
dozens
of
tiny
kitchens
the
temperature
of
which
was
not
much
below
that
of
the
ovens
themselves
and
kindly
people
like
glendinning
and
urquhart
drove
in
in
hooded
buggies
with
green
dangling
from
their
hats
and
dropped
a
goose
here
a
turkey
there
on
their
less
prosperous
friends
they
robbed
their
gardens
too
of
the
summer
last
flowers
and
brilliant
geraniums
to
decorate
the
archdeacon
church
for
the
festival
and
many
ladies
spent
the
whole
day
beforehand
making
wreaths
and
crosses
and
festoons
to
encircle
the
lamps
no
one
was
busier
than
polly
she
wanted
to
give
purdy
who
had
been
on
short
commons
for
so
long
a
special
christmas
treat
she
had
willing
helpers
in
him
and
jerry
the
two
of
them
chopped
and
stoned
and
stirred
while
she
seated
on
the
block
of
the
woodstack
her
head
tied
up
in
an
old
plucked
and
singed
the
goose
that
had
fallen
to
her
share
towards
four
on
christmas
day
they
drew
their
chairs
to
the
table
and
with
loosened
collars
set
about
enjoying
the
good
things
or
pretending
to
enjoy
them
this
was
mahony
case
for
the
day
was
no
holiday
for
him
and
his
head
ached
from
the
sun
at
hempel
arrived
to
pay
a
call
looking
very
spruce
in
a
long
black
coat
and
white
tie
and
close
on
his
heels
followed
old
ocock
the
latter
having
deposited
his
hat
under
his
seat
and
tapped
several
pockets
produced
a
letter
which
he
unfolded
and
handed
to
polly
with
a
broad
grin
it
was
from
his
daughter
and
contained
the
news
of
his
wife
death
died
o
the
grumbles
i
lay
you
an
the
first
good
turn
she
ever
done
me
the
main
point
was
that
miss
amelia
now
at
liberty
was
already
taking
advice
about
the
safest
line
of
and
asking
for
a
reply
by
return
to
a
number
of
extraordinary
questions
could
one
depend
on
hearing
god
word
preached
of
a
sunday
was
it
customary
for
females
to
go
armed
as
well
as
men
were
the
blacks
converted
and
what
amount
of
clothing
did
they
wear
thinks
she
comin
to
the
back
o
beyond
does
mely
chuckled
the
old
man
and
slapped
his
thigh
at
the
sudden
idea
that
occurred
to
him
of
takin
a
rise
out
of
wo
she
stare
when
she
gits
that
all
well
now
you
simply
have
to
build
said
polly
after
threatening
to
write
privately
to
miss
amelia
to
reassure
her
why
not
move
over
west
and
take
up
a
piece
of
ground
in
the
same
road
as
themselves
but
from
this
he
excused
himself
with
a
laugh
and
a
spit
on
the
score
that
no
had
yet
been
held
in
their
neighbourhood
when
he
did
turn
out
of
his
present
four
walls
which
had
always
been
plenty
good
enough
for
him
he
wanted
a
place
he
could
fit
up
tidy
which
it
stick
in
his
throat
to
do
so
if
he
thought
it
might
any
day
be
sold
over
his
head
mahony
winced
at
this
then
laughed
with
an
exaggerated
carelessness
if
in
a
country
like
this
you
waited
for
all
to
be
fixed
and
sure
you
would
wait
till
domesday
none
the
less
the
thrust
rankled
it
was
a
fact
that
he
himself
had
not
spent
a
sou
on
his
premises
since
they
finished
building
the
thought
at
the
back
of
his
mind
too
was
why
waste
his
income
on
improvements
that
might
benefit
only
the
the
yard
they
sat
in
for
instance
polly
had
her
hens
and
a
ramshackle
but
not
a
spadeful
of
earth
had
been
turned
towards
the
garden
it
was
just
the
ordinary
colonial
backyard
fenced
round
with
rude
palings
which
did
not
match
and
were
mended
here
and
there
with
bits
of
its
ground
space
littered
with
a
medley
of
articles
for
which
there
was
no
room
elsewhere
boards
left
lying
by
the
builders
empty
a
couple
of
tubs
a
ragged
some
old
cases
on
which
at
the
moment
a
row
of
stockings
hung
stretched
permanently
from
corner
to
corner
and
the
whole
was
dominated
by
the
big
round
tank
on
boxing
day
purdy
got
the
loan
of
a
lorry
and
drove
a
large
party
including
several
children
comfortably
placed
on
straw
hassocks
and
low
chairs
to
the
races
a
few
miles
out
half
ballarat
was
making
in
the
same
direction
and
whoever
owned
a
horse
that
was
sound
in
the
wind
and
anything
of
a
stepper
had
entered
it
for
some
item
on
the
programme
the
grand
stand
a
bark
shed
open
to
the
air
on
three
sides
was
resorted
to
only
in
the
case
of
a
sudden
downpour
the
occupants
of
the
buggies
wagonettes
brakes
carts
and
drays
preferred
to
follow
events
standing
on
their
seats
and
on
the
boards
that
served
them
as
seats
after
the
meeting
those
who
belonged
to
the
set
went
on
to
yarangobilly
and
danced
till
long
pastmidnight
on
the
broad
verandah
it
was
nearly
three
before
purdy
brought
his
load
safely
home
under
the
round
white
moon
the
lorry
was
strewn
with
the
forms
of
sleeping
children
early
next
morning
while
polly
still
only
half
awake
was
pouring
out
coffee
and
giving
richard
who
poor
fellow
could
not
afford
to
leave
his
patients
an
account
of
their
doings
with
certain
omissions
of
course
she
did
not
mention
the
glaring
indiscretion
agnes
glendinning
had
been
guilty
of
in
disappearing
with
henry
ocock
into
a
dark
shrubbery
while
polly
talked
the
postman
handed
in
two
letters
which
were
of
a
nature
to
put
balls
and
races
clean
out
of
her
head
the
first
was
in
beamish
hand
and
told
a
sorrowful
tale
custom
had
entirely
gone
a
new
hotel
had
been
erected
on
the
new
road
beamish
was
forced
to
declare
himself
a
bankrupt
and
in
a
few
days
the
family
hotel
with
all
its
contents
would
be
put
up
at
public
auction
what
was
to
become
of
them
god
alone
knew
she
supposed
she
would
end
her
days
in
taking
in
washing
and
the
girls
must
go
out
as
servants
but
she
was
sure
polly
now
so
up
in
the
world
with
a
husband
doing
so
well
would
not
forget
the
old
friends
who
had
once
been
so
kind
to
her
with
much
more
in
the
same
strain
which
polly
skipped
in
reading
the
letter
aloud
the
long
and
short
of
it
was
would
polly
ask
her
husband
to
lend
them
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
to
make
a
fresh
start
with
or
failing
that
to
put
his
name
to
a
bill
for
the
same
amount
of
course
she
has
an
idea
we
were
obliged
to
borrow
money
ourselves
said
polly
in
response
to
mahony
ironic
laugh
i
could
tell
them
that
no
nor
that
it
a
perpetual
struggle
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
answered
her
husband
battering
in
the
top
of
an
egg
with
the
back
of
his
spoon
oh
richard
dear
things
are
quite
so
bad
as
that
said
polly
cheerfully
then
she
heaved
a
sigh
i
know
of
course
we
ca
afford
to
help
them
but
i
do
feel
so
sorry
for
them
she
herself
would
have
given
the
dress
off
her
back
and
i
think
dear
if
you
did
mind
very
much
we
might
ask
one
of
the
girls
up
to
stay
with
us
till
the
worst
is
over
yes
i
suppose
that
would
be
impossible
said
mahony
if
set
your
heart
on
it
my
polly
if
too
you
can
persuade
master
purdy
to
forgo
the
comfort
of
your
good
and
i
see
if
i
can
wring
out
a
fiver
for
you
to
enclose
in
your
letter
polly
jumped
up
and
kissed
him
purdy
is
going
anyhow
he
said
only
last
night
he
must
look
for
lodgings
near
the
police
station
here
a
thought
struck
her
she
coloured
and
smiled
i
ask
tilly
first
said
she
mahony
laughed
and
shook
his
finger
at
her
the
best
laid
plans
mice
and
men
and
what
one
to
say
to
a
who
is
still
growing
out
of
her
clothes
at
this
polly
clapped
a
hand
over
his
mouth
for
fear
ellen
should
hear
him
it
was
a
sore
point
with
her
that
she
had
more
than
once
of
late
had
to
lengthen
her
dresses
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
she
sat
down
to
compose
a
reply
to
beamish
it
was
no
easy
job
she
was
obliged
to
say
that
richard
felt
unable
to
come
to
their
aid
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
touching
on
his
private
affairs
had
to
disappoint
as
kindly
as
she
could
to
be
truthful
yet
tactful
polly
wrote
and
the
business
cost
her
the
forenoon
she
could
not
even
press
tilly
to
pack
her
box
and
come
at
once
for
her
second
letter
that
morning
had
been
from
sara
who
wrote
that
having
decided
to
shake
the
dust
of
the
colony
off
her
feet
she
wished
to
pay
them
a
flying
visit
before
sailing
pour
faire
mes
adieux
she
signed
herself
your
affectionate
sister
zara
and
on
her
arrival
explained
that
tired
of
continually
instructing
people
in
the
pronunciation
of
her
name
she
had
decided
to
alter
the
spelling
and
be
done
with
it
moreover
a
little
bird
had
whispered
in
her
ear
that
under
its
new
form
it
fitted
her
rather
french
air
and
looks
a
thousand
times
better
than
before
descending
from
the
coach
zara
eyed
polly
up
and
down
and
vowed
she
would
never
have
known
her
and
on
the
way
home
polly
more
than
once
felt
her
sister
gaze
fixed
critically
on
her
for
her
part
she
was
able
to
assure
zara
that
she
saw
no
change
whatever
in
her
since
her
last
visit
even
since
the
date
of
the
wedding
and
this
pleased
zara
mightily
for
as
she
admitted
in
removing
hat
and
mantle
and
passing
the
damped
corner
of
a
towel
over
her
face
she
dreaded
the
ageing
effects
of
the
climate
on
her
fine
complexion
close
as
ever
about
her
own
concerns
she
gave
no
reason
for
her
abrupt
determination
to
leave
the
country
but
from
subsequent
talk
polly
gathered
that
for
one
thing
zara
had
found
her
position
at
the
head
of
establishment
undertaken
in
the
first
place
my
dear
at
immense
personal
sacrifice
no
sinecure
john
had
proved
a
regular
martinet
he
had
countermanded
her
orders
interfered
about
the
household
bills
had
even
accused
her
of
lining
her
own
pocket
as
for
little
johnny
the
bait
originally
thrown
out
to
induce
her
to
accept
the
post
he
had
long
since
been
sent
to
a
thoroughly
bad
unprincipled
boy
was
zara
verdict
and
when
polly
big
with
pity
expostulated
but
zara
he
is
only
six
years
old
her
sister
retorted
with
a
my
dear
i
know
the
world
and
you
do
to
which
polly
could
think
of
no
reply
zara
had
announced
herself
for
a
bare
fortnight
stay
but
the
man
who
carried
her
trunk
groaned
and
sweated
under
it
and
was
so
insolent
about
the
size
of
the
coin
she
dropped
in
his
palm
that
polly
followed
him
by
stealth
into
the
passage
to
make
it
up
to
a
crown
as
usual
zara
was
attired
in
the
height
of
fashion
she
brought
a
set
of
the
hoops
with
her
the
first
to
be
seen
on
ballarat
and
once
more
polly
was
torn
between
an
honest
admiration
of
her
sister
daring
and
an
equally
honest
embarrassment
at
the
notice
she
attracted
zara
swam
and
glided
about
the
streets
to
the
hilarious
amazement
of
the
population
floated
billowing
here
depressing
there
with
all
the
waywardness
of
a
child
balloon
supported
or
so
it
seemed
by
two
of
the
tiniest
feet
ever
bestowed
on
mortal
woman
aha
but
that
was
one
of
the
chief
merits
of
the
hoops
declared
zara
that
and
the
possibility
of
getting
still
more
stuff
into
your
skirts
without
materially
increasing
their
weight
there
was
something
in
that
conceded
polly
who
often
felt
hers
drag
heavy
besides
as
she
reminded
richard
that
night
when
he
lay
alternately
chuckling
and
snorting
at
woman
folly
custom
was
everything
once
they
had
smiled
at
zara
appearing
in
a
hat
and
now
we
all
wearing
them
another
practical
consideration
that
occurred
to
her
she
expressed
with
some
diffidence
but
zara
do
you
i
mean
are
they
very
draughty
zara
had
to
repeat
her
shocked
but
emphatic
denial
in
the
presence
of
glendinning
and
urquhart
both
ladies
having
a
mind
to
bring
their
wardrobes
up
to
date
they
agreed
that
there
was
much
to
be
said
in
favour
of
the
appliance
over
and
above
its
novelty
especially
would
it
be
welcome
at
those
times
when
but
here
the
speakers
dropped
into
woman
mysterious
code
of
nods
and
signs
while
zara
turning
modestly
away
pretended
to
count
the
stitches
in
a
yes
nowadays
as
mahony
polly
was
able
to
introduce
her
sister
to
a
society
worthy
of
zara
gifts
and
zara
enjoyed
herself
so
well
that
had
her
berth
not
been
booked
she
might
have
contemplated
extending
her
visit
she
overflowed
with
gracious
commendation
the
house
though
of
course
compared
with
john
splendour
a
trifle
plain
and
poky
was
a
decided
advance
on
the
store
polly
herself
much
improved
you
do
look
robust
my
dear
and
though
zara
held
her
peace
about
this
the
fact
of
mahony
being
from
home
each
day
for
hours
at
a
stretch
lent
an
additional
prop
to
her
satisfaction
under
these
conditions
it
was
possible
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
her
zara
natty
appearance
and
sprightly
ways
made
her
a
favourite
with
every
one
especially
the
gentlemen
the
episcopal
bazaar
came
off
at
this
time
and
zara
had
the
brilliant
idea
of
a
this
was
the
success
of
the
entertainment
from
behind
the
where
with
long
she
was
pouring
out
cups
of
tea
and
serving
cheesecakes
and
by
the
hundred
polly
looked
proudly
across
the
beflagged
hall
to
the
merry
group
of
which
her
sister
was
the
centre
zara
was
holding
her
own
even
with
henry
ocock
and
urquhart
had
constituted
himself
her
right
hand
your
sister
is
no
doubt
a
most
fascinating
woman
said
urquhart
from
the
seat
with
which
she
had
been
accommodated
and
heaved
a
gentle
sigh
how
odd
that
she
should
never
have
married
i
afraid
zara
too
particular
said
polly
it
not
for
want
of
being
asked
her
eyes
met
purdy
as
she
spoke
purdy
had
come
up
laden
with
empty
cups
a
pair
of
infants
boots
dangling
round
his
neck
and
they
exchanged
smiles
for
zara
latest
affaire
du
coeur
was
a
source
of
great
amusement
to
them
polly
had
assisted
at
the
first
meeting
between
her
sister
and
purdy
with
very
mixed
feelings
on
that
occasion
purdy
happened
to
be
in
plain
clothes
and
zara
pronounced
him
charming
the
next
day
however
he
dropped
in
clad
in
the
blue
jacket
the
high
boots
and
he
wore
when
on
duty
and
thereupon
zara
opinion
of
him
sank
to
null
and
was
not
to
be
raised
even
by
him
presenting
himself
in
full
dress
trousers
red
faced
shell
jacket
cap
cartouche
box
and
cavalry
sword
la
polly
nothing
but
a
common
policeman
in
vain
did
polly
explain
the
difference
between
a
member
of
the
ordinary
force
and
a
mounted
trooper
of
the
in
vain
lay
stress
on
richard
pleasure
at
seeing
purdy
buckle
to
steady
work
no
matter
what
zara
thoughts
had
taken
wing
for
a
land
where
such
anomalies
were
not
where
you
were
not
asked
to
drink
tea
with
the
constable
who
led
you
across
a
crowded
thoroughfare
or
turned
on
his
bull
eye
for
you
in
a
fog
preparatory
to
calling
up
a
but
the
chilly
condescension
with
which
from
now
on
zara
treated
him
did
not
seem
to
trouble
purdy
when
he
ran
in
for
five
minutes
of
a
morning
he
eschewed
the
front
entrance
and
took
up
his
perch
on
the
from
here
while
polly
cooked
and
he
nibbled
pastry
the
two
of
them
followed
the
progress
of
events
in
the
parlour
zara
arrival
on
ballarat
had
been
the
cue
for
hempel
reappearance
and
now
hardly
a
day
went
by
on
which
the
did
not
neglect
his
chapel
work
in
order
to
pay
what
zara
called
his
devoirs
slight
were
his
pretexts
for
coming
a
rare
bit
of
dried
seaweed
for
bookmark
a
religious
journal
with
a
page
a
nosegay
and
though
zara
would
not
nowadays
go
the
length
of
walking
out
with
a
dissenter
she
preferred
on
her
airings
to
occupy
the
of
she
had
no
objection
to
hempel
keeping
her
company
during
the
empty
hours
of
the
forenoon
when
polly
was
lost
in
domestic
cares
she
accepted
his
offerings
mimicked
his
faulty
speech
and
was
continually
hauling
him
up
the
precipice
of
only
to
let
him
slip
back
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
top
one
day
purdy
entered
the
kitchen
doubled
up
with
laughter
in
passing
the
front
of
the
house
he
had
thrown
a
look
in
at
the
and
the
sight
of
the
prim
and
proper
hempel
on
his
knees
on
the
woolly
hearthrug
so
tickled
his
sense
of
humour
that
having
spluttered
out
the
news
back
he
went
to
the
passage
where
he
crouched
down
before
the
and
glued
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
oh
purdy
no
what
if
the
door
should
suddenly
fly
open
but
there
was
something
in
purdy
pranks
that
a
like
polly
could
never
for
long
withstand
here
now
in
feigning
to
imitate
the
unfortunate
hempel
he
was
sheerly
irresistible
he
clapped
his
hands
to
his
heart
showed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
wept
gesticulated
and
tore
his
hair
and
polly
after
trying
in
vain
to
keep
a
straight
face
sat
down
and
went
off
into
a
fit
of
stifled
mirth
and
when
polly
did
give
way
she
was
apt
to
set
every
one
round
her
laughing
too
ellen
shoulders
shook
she
held
a
fist
to
her
mouth
even
little
trotty
shrilled
out
her
tinny
treble
without
knowing
in
the
least
what
the
joke
was
when
the
merriment
was
at
its
height
the
front
door
opened
and
in
walked
mahony
an
instant
blank
amazement
and
he
had
grasped
the
whole
situation
richard
was
always
so
fearfully
quick
at
understanding
thought
polly
ruefully
then
though
purdy
jumped
to
his
feet
and
the
laughter
died
out
as
if
by
command
he
drew
his
brows
together
and
without
saying
a
word
stalked
into
the
surgery
and
shut
the
door
like
a
schoolboy
who
has
been
caned
purdy
dug
his
knuckles
into
his
eyes
and
rubbed
his
hindquarters
to
the
fresh
delight
of
trotty
and
the
girl
well
so
long
polly
i
better
be
making
tracks
the
old
man
on
the
warpath
and
in
an
undertone
same
old
grouser
never
could
take
a
joke
he
tired
i
make
it
all
right
gave
polly
back
it
was
only
his
fun
richard
she
pleaded
as
she
held
out
a
linen
jacket
for
her
husband
to
slip
his
arms
into
fun
of
a
kind
i
wo
permit
in
my
house
what
an
example
to
set
the
child
what
more
i
shall
let
hempel
know
that
he
is
being
made
a
butt
of
and
speak
my
mind
to
your
sister
about
her
heartless
behaviour
oh
do
do
that
richard
i
promise
it
sha
happen
again
it
was
very
stupid
of
us
i
know
but
purdy
did
really
mean
it
unkindly
and
he
is
so
comical
when
he
starts
to
imitate
people
and
polly
was
all
but
off
again
at
the
remembrance
but
mahony
stooping
to
decipher
the
names
ellen
had
written
on
the
slate
did
not
unbend
it
was
not
merely
the
vulgar
joke
that
had
offended
him
no
what
really
rankled
was
the
sudden
chill
his
entrance
had
cast
over
the
group
they
had
scattered
and
gone
scurrying
about
their
business
like
a
pack
of
naughty
children
who
had
been
up
to
mischief
behind
their
master
back
he
was
the
schoolmaster
the
spoilsport
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
even
polly
but
here
came
polly
herself
to
say
dinner
dear
in
her
kindest
tone
she
also
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
hugged
him
not
cross
any
more
richard
i
know
we
behaved
disgracefully
her
touch
put
the
crown
on
her
words
mahony
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
but
the
true
origin
of
the
unpleasantness
zara
who
in
her
ghoulish
delight
at
seeing
hempel
grovel
before
her
thus
mahony
worded
it
behaved
more
kittenishly
than
ever
at
table
zara
mahony
could
not
so
easily
forgive
and
for
the
remainder
of
her
stay
his
manner
to
her
was
so
forbidding
that
she
too
froze
and
to
polly
regret
the
old
bad
relation
between
them
came
up
anew
but
zara
was
enjoying
herself
too
well
to
cut
her
visit
short
on
mahony
account
besides
poor
thing
thought
polly
she
has
really
nowhere
to
go
what
she
did
do
was
to
carry
her
head
very
high
in
her
presence
to
speak
at
him
rather
than
to
him
and
in
private
to
insist
to
polly
on
her
powers
of
discernment
you
may
say
what
you
like
my
dear
i
can
see
you
have
a
very
great
deal
to
put
up
with
at
last
however
the
day
of
her
departure
broke
and
she
went
off
amid
a
babble
of
farewells
of
requests
for
remembrance
a
fluttering
of
the
like
of
which
polly
had
never
known
and
to
himself
mahony
breathed
the
hope
that
they
had
seen
the
last
of
zara
her
fripperies
and
affectations
your
sister
will
certainly
fit
better
into
the
conditions
of
english
life
polly
cried
at
the
parting
which
might
be
final
then
blew
her
nose
and
dried
her
eyes
for
she
had
a
busy
day
before
her
tilly
beamish
had
been
waiting
with
impatience
for
zara
to
vacate
the
spare
room
and
was
to
arrive
that
night
mahony
was
not
at
home
to
welcome
the
nor
could
he
be
present
at
high
tea
when
he
returned
towards
nine
he
found
polly
with
a
very
red
face
and
so
full
of
fussy
cares
for
her
comfort
her
natural
kindliness
distorted
to
caricature
that
she
had
not
a
word
for
him
one
look
at
miss
tilly
explained
everything
and
his
respects
duly
paid
he
retired
to
the
surgery
to
indulge
a
smile
at
polly
expense
here
polly
soon
joined
him
tilly
fatigued
by
her
journey
and
by
her
bounteous
meal
having
betaken
herself
early
to
bed
ha
ha
laughed
mahony
not
without
a
certain
mischievous
satisfaction
at
his
young
wife
discomfiture
and
with
the
prospect
of
a
second
edition
to
follow
but
polly
would
not
capitulate
right
off
i
do
think
it
very
kind
of
you
to
talk
like
that
richard
she
said
warmly
people
ca
help
their
looks
she
moved
about
the
room
putting
things
straight
and
avoiding
his
eye
as
long
as
they
mean
well
and
are
good
but
i
think
you
would
rather
no
one
ever
came
to
stay
with
us
at
all
fixing
her
with
meaning
insistence
and
still
smiling
mahony
opened
his
arms
the
next
moment
polly
was
on
his
knee
her
face
hidden
in
his
shoulder
there
she
shed
a
few
tears
oh
is
she
dreadful
i
know
what
i
shall
do
with
her
she
been
serving
behind
the
bar
richard
for
more
than
a
year
and
she
come
expecting
to
be
taken
everywhere
and
to
have
any
amount
of
gaiety
at
she
had
dragged
a
reluctant
purdy
to
the
office
but
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
tilly
on
the
box
richard
beside
the
driver
with
her
hair
all
in
the
wind
he
just
said
lor
polly
and
disappeared
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
i
do
know
how
i
should
have
got
on
if
it
had
been
for
old
ocock
who
was
down
meeting
a
parcel
he
was
most
kind
he
helped
us
home
with
her
and
saw
after
her
trunk
and
oh
dear
what
do
you
think
when
he
was
going
away
he
said
to
me
in
the
passage
so
loud
i
sure
tilly
must
have
heard
him
he
said
something
like
a
figure
of
a
female
this
time
doc
as
fine
a
young
woman
as
ever
i
see
and
polly
hid
her
face
again
and
husband
and
wife
laughed
in
concert
chapter
viii
that
night
a
great
storm
rose
mahony
sitting
reading
after
everyone
else
had
retired
saw
it
coming
and
lamp
in
hand
went
round
the
house
to
secure
hasps
and
catches
then
stood
at
the
window
to
watch
the
storm
approach
in
one
half
of
the
sky
the
stars
were
still
peacefully
alight
the
other
was
hidden
by
a
dense
cloud
which
came
racing
along
like
a
giant
bat
with
outspread
wings
devouring
the
stars
in
its
flight
the
storm
broke
there
was
a
sudden
shrill
screeching
a
grinding
piping
whistling
and
the
wind
hurled
itself
against
the
house
as
if
to
level
it
with
the
ground
failing
in
this
it
banged
and
battered
making
windows
and
doors
shake
like
loose
teeth
in
their
sockets
then
it
swept
by
to
wreak
its
fury
elsewhere
and
there
was
a
grateful
lull
out
of
which
burst
a
peal
of
thunder
and
now
peal
followed
peal
and
the
face
of
the
sky
with
its
masses
of
swirling
frothy
cloud
resembled
an
angry
sea
the
lightning
ripped
it
in
fierce
zigzags
darting
out
hundreds
of
spectral
fangs
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
polly
came
running
to
see
where
he
was
the
child
cried
miss
tilly
opened
her
door
by
a
and
thrust
a
red
puffy
face
framed
in
through
the
crack
nobody
thought
of
sleep
while
the
commotion
lasted
for
fear
of
fire
once
alight
these
exposed
little
wooden
houses
blazed
up
like
heaps
of
shavings
the
pointed
to
one
before
the
storm
showed
signs
of
abating
now
the
rain
was
pouring
down
making
an
din
on
the
iron
roof
and
leaping
from
every
gutter
and
spout
it
had
turned
very
cold
mahony
shivered
as
he
got
into
bed
he
seemed
hardly
to
have
closed
an
eye
when
he
was
wakened
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
same
time
the
wire
of
the
was
almost
wrenched
in
two
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
wanted
a
few
minutes
to
three
the
rain
was
still
falling
in
torrents
the
wind
sighed
and
moaned
wild
horses
should
not
drag
him
out
on
such
a
night
thrusting
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
he
threw
up
the
parlour
window
who
there
the
hiss
of
the
rain
cut
his
words
through
a
figure
on
the
doorstep
turned
at
the
sound

he
did
so
letting
in
a
blast
of
wind
and
a
rush
of
rain
that
flooded
the
oilcloth
the
intruder
off
whom
the
water
streamed
had
to
shout
to
make
himself
audible

i
will
pshaw
mahony
opened
the
door
of
the
surgery
and
struck
a
match
it
was
a
rough
grizzled
fellow
a
cocky
on
his
own
showing
who
presented
himself
in
the
lamplight
his
wife
had
fallen
ill
that
afternoon
at
first
everything
seemed
to
be
going
well
then
she
was
seized
with
fits
had
one
fit
after
another
and
all
but
bit
her
tongue
in
two
there
was
nobody
with
her
but
a
young
girl
he
had
fetched
from
a
mile
away
he
had
meant
when
her
time
came
to
bring
her
to
the
district
hospital
but
they
had
been
taken
unawares
while
he
waited
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
face
between
his
clenched
fists
in
dressing
mahony
reassured
polly
and
instructed
her
what
to
say
to
people
who
came
inquiring
after
him
it
was
unlikely
he
would
be
back
before
afternoon
most
of
the
patients
could
wait
till
then
the
one
exception
a
case
of
typhoid
in
its
second
week
a
young
scotch
surgeon
brace
whom
he
had
obliged
in
a
similar
emergency
would
no
doubt
see
for
him
she
should
send
ellen
down
with
a
note
and
having
poured
doyle
out
a
nobbler
and
put
a
flask
in
his
own
pocket
mahony
reopened
the
front
door
to
the
howl
of
the
wind
the
lantern
his
guide
carried
shed
only
a
tiny
circlet
of
light
on
the
blackness
and
the
two
men
picked
their
steps
gingerly
along
the
flooded
road
the
rain
ran
in
jets
off
the
brim
of
mahony
hat
and
down
the
back
of
his
neck
having
climbed
into
the
buggy
they
advanced
at
a
funeral
pace
leaving
it
to
the
sagacity
of
the
horse
to
keep
the
track
at
the
creek
sure
enough
the
water
was
out
the
bridge
gone
to
reach
the
next
bridge
five
miles
off
a
crazy
drive
would
have
been
necessary
and
mahony
was
for
giving
up
the
job
but
doyle
would
not
acknowledge
defeat
he
unharnessed
the
horse
set
mahony
on
its
back
and
himself
holding
to
its
tail
forced
the
beast
by
dint
of
kicking
and
lashing
into
the
water
and
not
only
got
them
safely
across
but
up
the
steep
sticky
clay
of
the
opposite
bank
it
was
six
and
a
cloudless
morning
when
numb
with
cold
his
clothing
clinging
to
him
like
wet
seaweed
mahony
entered
the
wooden
hut
where
the
real
work
he
had
come
out
to
do
began
later
in
the
day
clad
in
an
odd
collection
of
baggy
garments
he
sat
and
warmed
himself
in
the
sun
which
was
fast
drawing
up
in
the
form
of
a
blankety
mist
the
moisture
from
the
ground
he
had
successfully
performed
under
the
worst
possible
conditions
a
ticklish
operation
and
was
now
so
tired
that
with
his
chin
on
his
chest
he
fell
fast
asleep
doyle
wakened
him
by
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
buggy
the
good
man
who
had
more
than
one
nobbler
during
the
morning
could
not
hold
his
tongue
but
made
still
another
wordy
attempt
to
express
his
gratitude
whither
me
girl
lives
or
dies
it
not
be
mat
doyle
who
forgits
what
you
did
for
him
this
night
doctor
an
if
iver
you
want
a
bit
o
work
done
or
some
one
to
do
your
lyin
awake
at
night
for
you
just
you
gim
me
the
tip
i
do
mind
tellin
you
now
i
me
here
he
touched
his
right
hip
an
if
you
refused
you
was
the
third
mind
you
i
have
drilled
you
where
you
stood
god
damn
me
if
i
would
mahony
eyed
the
speaker
with
derision
much
good
that
would
have
done
your
wife
you
fathead
well
well
we
say
nothing
to
mine
if
you
please
about
anything
of
that
sort
no
may
all
the
saints
bless
and
give
health
an
as
i
say
doctor
in
speaking
he
had
drawn
a
roll
of
from
his
pocket
and
now
he
tried
to
stuff
them
between
mahony
fingers
what
this
my
good
man
keep
your
money
till
it
asked
for
and
mahony
unclasped
his
hands
so
that
the
notes
fluttered
to
the
ground
then
there
let
lay
but
when
in
clothes
dried
stiff
as
cardboard
mahony
was
rolling
townwards
his
coachman
a
lad
of
some
ten
or
twelve
who
handled
the
reins
to
the
manner
born
as
they
went
he
chanced
to
feel
in
his
coat
pocket
and
there
found
five
notes
rolled
up
in
a
neat
bundle
the
main
part
of
the
road
was
dry
and
hard
again
but
all
dips
and
holes
were
wells
of
liquid
mud
which
bespattered
the
two
of
them
from
top
to
toe
as
the
buggy
bumped
carelessly
in
and
out
mahony
diverted
himself
by
thinking
of
what
he
could
give
polly
with
this
sum
it
would
serve
to
buy
that
pair
of
gilt
cornices
or
the
heavy
pierglass
on
which
she
had
set
her
heart
he
could
see
her
pink
with
pleasure
expostulating
richard
what
wicked
extravagance
and
hear
himself
reply
and
pray
may
my
wife
not
have
as
pretty
a
parlour
as
her
neighbours
he
even
cast
a
thought
in
passing
on
the
pianoforte
with
which
polly
longed
to
crown
the
furnishings
of
her
room
though
of
course
at
least
treble
this
amount
would
be
needed
to
cover
its
but
a
fig
for
such
nonsense
he
knew
but
one
legitimate
use
to
make
of
the
unexpected
little
windfall
and
that
was
to
put
it
by
for
a
rainy
day
at
my
age
in
my
position
i
ought
to
have
fifty
pounds
in
the
bank
times
without
number
he
had
said
this
to
himself
with
a
growing
impatience
but
he
had
not
yet
managed
to
save
a
halfpenny
thrive
as
the
practice
might
the
expenses
of
living
held
even
pace
with
it
and
now
having
got
its
cue
his
brain
started
off
again
on
the
old
treadmill
reckoning
totting
up
finding
totals
or
more
often
failing
to
find
them
till
his
head
was
as
hot
as
his
feet
were
cold
he
could
not
think
clearly
at
all
nor
the
next
day
either
by
the
time
he
reached
home
he
was
conscious
of
feeling
very
ill
he
had
lancinating
pains
in
his
limbs
a
chill
down
his
spine
an
outrageous
temperature
to
set
out
again
on
a
round
of
visits
was
impossible
he
had
just
to
tumble
into
bed
he
got
between
the
sheets
with
that
sense
of
utter
of
almost
sensual
satisfaction
which
only
one
who
is
shivering
with
fever
knows
and
at
first
very
small
things
were
enough
to
fill
him
with
content
the
smoothness
of
the
pillow
sleek
linen
the
shadowy
light
of
the
room
after
long
days
spent
in
the
dusty
glare
outside
the
possibility
of
resting
the
knowledge
that
it
was
his
duty
to
rest
polly
soft
firm
hands
which
were
always
of
the
right
temperature
warm
in
the
cold
stage
cool
when
the
fever
scorched
him
and
neither
hot
nor
cold
when
the
dripping
sweats
came
on
but
as
the
fever
declined
these
slight
pleasures
lost
their
hold
then
he
was
ridden
to
death
by
black
thoughts
not
only
was
day
being
added
to
day
he
meanwhile
not
turning
over
a
penny
but
ideas
which
he
knew
to
be
preposterous
insinuated
themselves
in
his
brain
thus
for
hours
on
end
he
writhed
under
the
belief
that
his
present
illness
was
due
solely
to
the
proximity
of
the
great
swamp
and
lay
and
cursed
his
folly
in
having
chosen
just
this
neighbourhood
to
build
in
again
there
was
the
case
of
typhoid
he
had
been
anxious
about
prior
to
his
own
breakdown
under
his
locum
peritonitis
had
set
in
and
carried
off
the
patient
at
the
time
he
had
accepted
the
news
from
polly
lips
with
indifference
too
ill
to
care
but
a
little
later
the
knowledge
of
what
it
meant
broke
over
him
and
he
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
not
brace
he
alone
would
be
held
responsible
for
the
death
and
perhaps
not
altogether
unjustly
lying
there
a
prey
to
morbid
apprehensions
he
rebuilt
the
case
in
memory
struggling
to
recall
each
slight
variation
in
temperature
each
swift
change
for
better
or
worse
but
as
fast
as
he
captured
one
such
detail
his
drowsy
brain
let
the
last
but
one
go
and
he
had
to
beat
it
up
anew
during
the
night
he
grew
confident
that
the
relatives
of
the
dead
woman
intended
to
take
action
against
him
for
negligence
or
improper
attendance
an
attempt
to
speak
of
these
devilish
imaginings
to
wife
and
friend
was
a
failure
he
undertook
it
in
a
fit
of
desperation
when
it
seemed
as
if
only
a
strong
and
well
grounded
opposition
would
save
his
reason
but
this
was
just
what
he
could
not
get
purdy
whom
he
tried
first
held
the
crude
notion
that
a
sick
person
should
never
be
gainsaid
and
soothingly
sympathised
and
agreed
till
mahony
could
have
cried
aloud
at
such
blundering
stupidity
polly
did
better
she
contradicted
him
but
not
in
the
right
way
she
certainly
his
idea
of
the
nearness
of
yuille
swamp
making
the
house
unhealthy
but
she
did
not
argue
the
matter
step
by
step
and
convince
him
that
he
was
wrong
she
just
laughed
at
him
as
at
a
foolish
child
and
kissed
him
and
tucked
him
in
anew
and
when
it
came
to
the
typhoid
fatal
issue
she
had
not
the
knowledge
needed
to
combat
him
with
any
chance
of
success
she
heard
him
anxiously
out
and
allowed
herself
to
be
made
quite
nervous
over
a
possible
fault
on
his
part
so
jealous
was
she
for
his
growing
reputation
so
that
in
the
end
it
was
he
who
had
to
comfort
her
do
take
any
notice
of
what
i
say
wife
it
this
blessed
fever
i
i
think
but
he
could
hear
her
uneasily
consulting
with
purdy
in
the
passage
it
was
not
till
his
pulse
beat
normally
again
that
he
could
smile
at
his
exaggerated
fears
now
too
reviving
health
brought
back
a
wholesome
interest
in
everyday
affairs
he
listened
with
amusement
to
polly
account
of
the
shifts
purdy
was
reduced
to
to
enter
the
house
unseen
by
miss
tilly
on
his
faithful
daily
call
the
young
man
would
creep
round
by
the
back
door
and
tilly
was
growing
more
and
more
irate
at
her
inability
to
waylay
him
yes
polly
was
rather
redly
forced
to
admit
she
had
abetted
him
in
his
evasions
you
know
poll
i
might
just
as
well
tie
myself
up
to
old
mother
herself
and
be
done
with
it
out
of
sheer
pique
tilly
had
twice
now
accepted
old
invitation
to
drive
with
him
once
she
had
returned
with
a
huge
bag
of
lollies
and
once
with
a
face
like
a
polly
could
help
thinking
no
really
richard
she
could
not
that
perhaps
something
might
come
of
it
he
should
not
laugh
just
wait
and
see
many
inquiries
had
been
made
after
him
people
had
missed
their
doctor
it
seemed
and
wanted
him
back
it
was
a
real
day
when
he
could
snap
to
the
catches
of
his
gloves
again
and
mount
the
step
of
a
buggy
he
had
instructed
purdy
to
arrange
for
the
hire
of
this
vehicle
being
out
of
the
question
for
him
in
the
meantime
and
on
his
first
long
journey
it
led
him
past
doyle
hut
now
he
was
sorry
to
see
in
the
hands
of
strangers
for
the
wife
on
the
way
to
making
a
fair
recovery
had
got
up
too
soon
overtaxed
her
strength
and
died
and
the
husband
was
gone
off
no
one
knew
where
on
this
drive
as
mile
after
mile
slid
from
under
the
wheels
mahony
felt
how
grateful
was
the
screen
of
a
hood
between
him
and
the
sun
while
he
was
laid
up
the
eternal
question
of
how
to
live
on
his
income
had
left
him
relatively
speaking
in
peace
he
had
of
late
adopted
the
habit
of
doing
his
scraping
and
saving
at
the
outset
of
each
quarter
so
as
to
get
the
money
due
to
ocock
put
by
betimes
his
illness
had
naturally
made
a
hole
in
this
and
now
the
living
from
hand
to
mouth
must
begin
anew
with
what
remained
of
doyle
money
he
proposed
to
settle
his
account
at
the
then
the
unexpected
happened
his
reappearance
he
looked
very
thin
and
evidently
jogged
a
couple
of
sleepy
memories
simultaneously
two
big
bills
were
paid
one
of
which
he
had
entirely
given
up
in
consequence
he
again
found
himself
fifty
pounds
to
the
good
and
driving
to
ocock
office
on
term
day
he
resolved
to
go
on
afterwards
to
the
bank
of
australasia
and
there
deposit
this
sum
grindle
set
off
by
a
pair
of
flaming
sideboards
himself
ushered
mahony
into
the
sanctum
and
the
affair
was
disposed
of
in
a
trice
ocock
was
one
of
the
busiest
of
men
nowadays
he
no
longer
needed
to
invent
sham
clients
and
fictitious
interviews
and
he
utilised
the
few
odd
minutes
it
took
to
procure
a
signature
jot
down
a
note
open
a
drawer
unlock
a
tin
box
to
remark
abstractedly
on
the
weather
and
put
a
polite
inquiry
and
your
good
lady
in
the
best
of
health
i
trust
on
emerging
from
the
inner
room
mahony
saw
that
the
places
formerly
filled
by
tom
and
johnny
were
occupied
by
strangers
and
he
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
indiscreet
to
ask
what
had
become
of
the
brothers
when
ocock
cut
across
his
intention
by
the
way
jenkins
has
that
memorandum
i
spoke
of
been
drawn
up
he
turned
to
a
clerk
with
a
sheet
of
foolscap
in
his
hand
he
invited
mahony
with
a
beck
of
the
chin
to
his
room
half
a
moment
now
doctor
if
you
happen
to
have
a
little
money
lying
idle
i
can
put
you
on
to
a
good
thing
a
very
good
thing
indeed
i
do
know
i
sure
whether
you
keep
an
eye
on
the
fluctuations
of
the
if
so
you
no
doubt
have
noticed
the
let
me
say
the
extreme
instability
of
after
making
an
excellent
start
they
have
dropped
till
they
are
now
to
be
had
at
of
their
original
value
he
did
not
take
much
interest
in
mining
matters
was
mahony
reply
however
he
knew
something
of
the
claim
in
question
if
only
because
several
of
his
acquaintances
had
abandoned
their
shares
in
disgust
at
the
repeated
calls
and
the
lack
of
dividends
exactly
well
now
doctor
i
in
a
position
to
inform
you
that
will
very
shortly
be
prime
favourites
on
the
market
selling
at
many
times
their
original
figure
their
original
figure
sir
no
one
with
a
few
hundreds
to
spare
could
find
a
better
investment
now
is
the
time
to
buy
a
few
hundreds
what
does
he
take
me
for
thought
mahony
and
declined
the
transaction
it
was
very
good
of
ocock
to
think
of
him
but
he
preferred
to
keep
clear
of
that
kind
of
thing
quite
so
quite
so
returned
ocock
suavely
and
his
hands
with
the
smile
mahony
had
never
learnt
to
fathom
just
as
you
please
of
i
only
ask
you
doctor
to
treat
the
matter
as
strictly
confidential
i
suppose
he
says
the
same
to
everyone
he
tells
was
mahony
comment
as
he
flicked
up
his
horse
and
he
wondered
what
the
extent
might
be
of
the
lawyer
personal
interest
in
the
porepunkah
company
probably
the
number
of
shareholders
was
not
large
enough
to
rake
up
the
capital
still
the
incident
gave
him
food
for
thought
and
only
after
closing
time
did
he
remember
his
intention
of
driving
home
by
way
of
the
bank
later
in
the
day
he
came
back
on
the
incident
and
pondered
his
abrupt
refusal
of
ocock
offer
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
this
he
never
took
advice
well
and
was
it
forced
upon
him
nine
times
out
of
ten
a
certain
inborn
contrariness
drove
him
to
do
just
the
opposite
besides
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
look
with
lenience
on
the
rage
for
speculation
that
had
seized
the
people
of
ballarat
and
he
held
that
it
would
be
culpable
for
a
man
of
his
slender
means
to
risk
money
in
the
great
but
was
there
any
hint
of
risk
in
the
present
instance
to
judge
from
ocock
manner
the
investment
was
as
safe
as
a
house
and
lucrative
to
a
degree
that
made
one
head
swim
many
times
their
original
figure
an
fashion
of
growing
rich
and
no
mistake
very
different
from
the
laborious
grind
of
his
days
in
which
he
had
always
to
reckon
with
the
chance
of
not
being
paid
at
all
that
very
afternoon
had
brought
him
a
fresh
example
of
this
he
was
returning
from
the
old
magpie
lead
where
he
had
been
called
to
a
case
of
scarlet
fever
and
saw
himself
covering
the
same
road
daily
for
some
time
to
come
but
he
had
learned
to
adjudge
his
patients
in
a
winking
and
these
he
could
swear
to
it
would
prove
to
be
of
a
kind
even
to
cut
and
run
once
the
child
was
out
of
danger
was
he
really
justified
cramped
for
money
as
he
was
in
rejecting
the
straight
tip
ocock
had
given
him
and
he
debated
this
moot
point
argued
his
need
against
his
principles
the
whole
way
home
as
soon
as
he
had
changed
and
seen
his
suspect
clothing
hung
out
to
air
he
went
impetuously
back
to
ocock
office
he
had
altered
his
mind
a
small
gift
from
a
grateful
patient
yes
fifty
please
they
might
bring
him
and
he
saw
his
name
written
down
as
the
owner
of
half
a
hundred
shares
after
this
he
took
a
new
interest
in
the
mining
sheet
of
the
star
turned
to
it
indeed
first
of
all
for
a
week
a
fortnight
porepunkahs
remained
stationary
then
they
made
a
call
and
if
he
did
not
wish
to
forfeit
he
had
to
pay
out
as
many
shillings
as
he
held
shares
a
day
or
two
later
they
sank
a
trifle
and
mahony
hopes
with
them
there
even
came
a
day
when
they
were
not
mentioned
and
he
gave
up
his
money
for
lost
but
of
a
sudden
they
woke
to
life
again
took
an
upward
bound
and
within
a
month
were
quoted
at
five
pounds
on
rumour
alone
very
sensitive
indeed
said
the
star
purdy
his
only
confidant
went
about
swearing
at
himself
for
having
let
the
few
he
owned
lapse
and
mahony
itched
to
sell
he
could
now
have
banked
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
but
ocock
laughed
him
out
of
countenance
even
went
so
far
as
to
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
on
no
account
was
he
to
think
of
selling
sit
tight
doctor
sit
tight
till
i
say
the
word
and
mahony
reluctantly
obeyed
chapter
ix
in
the
course
of
the
following
winter
john
turnham
came
to
stand
as
one
of
two
candidates
for
the
newly
proclaimed
electoral
district
of
ballarat
west
the
first
news
his
relatives
had
of
his
intention
was
gleaned
from
the
daily
paper
mahony
lit
on
the
paragraph
by
chance
one
morning
said
hullo
here
something
that
will
interest
you
my
dear
and
read
it
aloud
polly
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
pushed
her
plate
from
her
and
went
pink
with
pleasure
and
surprise
richard
you
do
mean
it
she
exclaimed
and
got
up
to
look
over
his
shoulder
yes
there
it
was
john
name
in
all
the
glory
of
print
john
millibank
turnham
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
and
most
highly
respected
denizens
of
our
marvellous
metropolis
and
a
staunch
supporter
of
democratic
rights
and
the
interests
of
our
people
polly
drew
a
deep
breath
do
you
know
richard
i
should
wonder
if
he
came
to
live
on
ballarat
i
mean
if
he
gets
does
trotty
hear
this
is
papa
they
writing
about
in
the
of
course
we
must
ask
him
to
stay
with
us
for
this
happened
during
an
interregnum
when
the
spare
room
was
temporarily
out
of
use
of
course
we
must
do
nothing
of
the
kind
your
brother
will
need
the
best
rooms
bath
can
give
him
and
when
he
not
actually
on
the
hustings
he
be
hobnobbing
in
the
bar
standing
as
many
drinks
as
there
are
throats
in
the
crowd
gave
back
mahony
who
had
the
lowest
possible
opinion
of
colonial
politics
well
at
least
i
can
write
and
tell
him
how
delighted
we
are
said
polly
not
to
be
done
find
out
first
my
dear
if
there
any
truth
in
the
report
i
can
hardly
think
john
would
have
left
us
in
the
dark
to
this
extent
but
john
corroborated
the
news
and
in
the
letter
polly
read
out
a
week
later
announced
the
opening
of
his
campaign
for
the
coming
month
i
shall
feel
much
obliged
to
your
husband
if
he
will
meanwhile
exert
his
influence
on
my
behalf
he
is
no
doubt
acquainted
professionally
with
many
of
the
leading
squatters
round
ballarat
whom
he
can
induce
to
support
my
candidature
umph
said
mahony
grumpily
and
went
on
scooping
out
his
egg
good
enough
to
tout
for
him
ssh
warned
polly
with
a
glance
at
trotty
think
what
it
means
to
him
richard
and
to
us
too
it
will
do
your
practice
ever
so
much
good
if
he
gets
in
to
be
the
of
the
member
we
must
help
all
we
can
dear
she
was
going
driving
to
yarangobilly
that
day
with
archdeacon
long
to
see
a
new
arrival
richard
had
recently
brought
into
the
world
and
now
she
laid
plans
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
entering
into
the
scheme
with
a
gusto
that
astonished
mahony
upon
my
word
wife
i
believe
you
glad
to
have
something
to
do
will
my
own
papa
gim
me
a
dolly
like
uncle
papa
here
piped
trotty
perhaps
but
you
will
have
to
be
a
very
good
girl
and
not
talk
with
your
mouth
full
or
dirty
your
pinnies
oh
here
a
postscript
polly
had
returned
to
the
sheet
and
was
gloating
over
it
john
writes
especially
must
he
endeavour
to
win
lawyer
ocock
over
to
my
side
i
lay
great
weight
on
o
support
oh
richard
now
is
that
unfortunate
i
do
hope
it
wo
make
any
difference
to
john
chances
polly
dismay
had
good
grounds
a
marked
coolness
had
sprung
up
between
her
husband
and
the
lawyer
and
on
no
account
she
knew
would
richard
consent
to
approach
henry
some
very
hot
remarks
made
by
the
latter
had
been
passed
on
to
her
by
glendinning
she
had
not
dared
to
tell
richard
the
worst
the
coolness
dated
from
an
afternoon
when
tilly
beamish
had
burst
into
the
house
in
a
state
of
rampant
excitement
oh
polly
oh
i
say
my
dear
whatever
do
you
think
that
old
cove
old
actually
had
the
cheek
to
make
me
a
proposal
tilly
gasped
polly
and
flushed
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
oh
my
dear
i
am
pleased
for
polly
conscience
was
still
somewhat
tender
about
the
aid
she
had
lent
purdy
in
his
evasions
the
two
women
kissed
and
tilly
cried
a
little
it
certainly
her
first
offer
thought
polly
aloud
she
asked
hesitatingly
and
do
you
shall
you
i
mean
are
you
going
to
accept
him
tilly
but
this
was
just
where
tilly
could
not
make
up
her
mind
should
she
take
him
or
should
she
not
for
two
whole
days
she
sat
about
debating
the
question
and
polly
listened
to
her
with
all
the
sympathy
and
interest
so
momentous
a
step
deserved
if
you
feel
you
could
really
learn
to
care
for
him
dear
of
course
it
would
be
nice
for
you
to
have
a
house
of
your
own
and
how
happy
it
would
make
poor
mother
to
see
you
settled
tilly
tore
the
last
veil
from
her
feelings
uttered
gross
confidences
polly
knew
well
enough
where
her
real
inclination
lay
i
hoped
against
hope
poll
that
a
certain
person
would
come
to
the
scratch
at
last
yes
it
was
true
enough
he
had
nothing
to
offer
her
but
she
was
the
sort
to
have
stuck
at
that
i
have
worked
my
hands
to
the
bone
for
poll
if
only
said
the
word
the
one
drawback
to
marriage
with
you
know
would
have
been
his
infirmity
polly
i
ca
picture
myself
dragging
a
husband
with
a
gammy
leg
at
my
heels
from
this
tilly
mind
glanced
back
to
the
suitor
who
had
honourably
declared
himself
of
course
old
o
had
a
great
deal
of
the
gentleman
about
him
and
their
ages
were
unsuitable
owns
to
and
as
you
know
poll
i
only
just
turned
at
which
polly
drooped
her
head
a
little
lower
over
the
handkerchief
she
was
hemming
to
avoid
meeting
her
friend
eye
poor
dear
tilly
she
would
never
see
thirty
again
and
she
need
hardly
have
troubled
thought
polly
to
be
insincere
with
her
but
in
the
same
breath
she
took
back
the
reproach
a
woman
herself
she
understood
something
of
the
fear
and
shame
and
heartburning
that
had
gone
to
the
making
of
the
lie
perhaps
too
it
was
a
gentle
hint
from
tilly
what
age
she
now
wished
to
be
considered
and
so
polly
agreed
and
said
tenderly
yes
certainly
the
difference
was
very
marked
meanwhile
tilly
flowed
on
these
were
the
two
chief
objections
on
the
other
hand
the
old
boy
was
ludicrously
smitten
and
she
thought
one
might
trust
her
tilly
to
soon
knock
him
into
shape
it
would
also
no
doubt
be
possible
to
squeeze
a
few
pounds
out
of
him
towards
assisting
pa
and
ma
in
their
present
struggle
again
as
a
married
woman
she
would
have
a
chance
of
helping
jinny
to
find
a
husband
though
jinn
gone
off
so
polly
i
bet
you
hardly
know
her
if
you
met
in
the
street
to
end
all
a
bird
in
hand
etc
and
besides
what
prospects
had
she
if
she
remained
a
spinster
so
when
she
was
asked
tilly
accepted
without
further
humming
and
hawing
an
invitation
to
drive
out
in
the
smart
ocock
had
hired
for
the
purpose
and
polly
saw
her
off
with
many
a
small
private
sign
of
encouragement
all
went
well
a
couple
of
hours
later
tilly
came
flying
in
caught
polly
up
in
a
bear
hug
and
danced
her
round
the
room
my
dear
wish
me
joy
oh
lor
polly
i
do
feel
she
was
wearing
a
large
of
diamonds
on
her
nothing
would
do
old
o
but
that
they
should
drive
there
and
then
to
the
finest
jeweller
in
sturt
street
where
she
had
the
pick
of
a
trayful
and
now
ocock
all
with
sheepish
pride
was
fetched
in
to
receive
congratulations
and
polly
produced
refreshments
and
healths
were
drunk
afterwards
the
happy
couple
dallied
in
the
passage
and
loitered
on
the
doorstep
till
evening
was
far
advanced
it
was
polly
who
in
clearing
away
was
struck
dumb
by
the
thought
but
now
whatever
is
to
become
of
miss
amelia
she
wondered
if
this
consideration
troubled
the
old
man
trouble
there
was
of
some
sort
he
called
at
the
house
three
days
running
for
a
word
with
richard
he
wore
a
pair
of
trousers
a
choker
that
his
hands
had
soiled
in
tying
a
black
coat
a
massive
gold
on
the
third
visit
he
was
lucky
enough
to
catch
mahony
and
the
door
of
the
surgery
closed
behind
them
here
ocock
sat
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
alternately
crushed
his
flat
between
his
palms
and
expanded
it
again
as
though
he
were
playing
a
concertina
and
coughed
out
a
wordy
preamble
he
assured
mahony
to
begin
with
how
highly
he
esteemed
him
it
was
because
of
this
because
he
knew
doctor
was
as
straight
as
a
pound
of
candles
that
he
was
going
to
ask
his
advice
on
an
awkward
matter
devilish
awkward
one
nobody
had
any
idea
of
either
except
henry
and
henry
had
kicked
up
such
a
deuce
of
a
row
at
his
wanting
to
marry
again
that
he
was
damned
if
he
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
besides
the
doctor
knew
what
lawyers
were
the
whole
breed
of
sharp
as
needles
especially
henry
but
with
a
sort
of
squint
in
their
upper
storey
that
made
see
every
mortal
thing
from
the
point
of
view
of
law
and
that
was
no
good
to
him
what
he
needed
was
a
plain
and
honest
a
he
hesitated
for
a
word
and
repeated
a
honest
opinion
for
he
only
wanted
to
do
the
right
thing
what
was
straight
and
above
board
and
at
last
out
it
came
did
doc
think
it
would
be
acting
on
the
square
and
not
taking
a
advantage
of
a
female
if
he
omitted
to
mention
to
the
future
o
that
up
till
six
months
back
he
had
been
obliged
to
well
he
spit
it
out
short
and
say
obliged
to
report
himself
to
the
authorities
at
fixed
intervals
women
were
such
shy
cattle
so
damned
odd
you
never
knew
how
they
take
a
thing
like
this
one
might
raise
cain
over
it
another
only
laugh
another
send
him
packing
he
did
want
to
let
a
fine
young
woman
like
matilda
slip
if
he
could
help
it
by
dad
he
did
but
he
felt
he
must
either
win
her
by
fair
dealing
or
not
at
all
and
having
got
the
load
off
his
chest
the
old
colonist
swallowed
hard
and
ran
the
back
of
his
hand
over
his
forehead
he
had
kept
his
eyes
glued
to
the
in
speaking
and
so
saw
neither
his
hearer
involuntary
start
at
the
damaging
disclosure
nor
the
nervous
tightening
of
the
hand
that
lay
along
the
arm
of
the
chair
mahony
sat
silent
balancing
a
and
fighting
down
a
feeling
of
extraordinary
discomfort
his
very
curled
under
the
strain
it
was
of
little
use
to
remind
himself
that
ever
since
he
had
known
him
ocock
had
led
a
decent
life
respected
both
in
his
business
relations
and
by
his
brethren
of
the
chapel
nor
could
he
spare
more
than
a
glance
in
passing
for
those
odd
traits
in
the
old
man
character
which
were
now
explained
his
itch
for
public
approval
his
unvarying
harshness
towards
the
pair
of
incorrigibles
who
weighed
him
down
at
this
moment
he
discounted
even
the
integrity
that
had
prompted
the
confession
his
attitude
of
mind
was
one
of
why
the
deuce
could
the
old
fool
have
held
his
tongue
oh
these
unbidden
injudicious
confidences
how
they
complicated
life
and
as
a
doctor
he
was
pestered
with
only
too
many
he
was
continually
being
forced
to
see
behind
the
scenes
now
outsiders
too
must
needs
choose
him
for
the
storehouse
of
their
privacies
himself
he
never
made
a
confidence
but
it
seemed
as
though
just
this
on
his
part
loosened
people
tongues
blind
to
the
flags
of
warning
he
hoisted
in
looks
and
bearing
they
innocently
proceeded
as
ocock
had
done
to
throw
up
insurmountable
barriers
he
could
hear
a
new
tone
in
his
own
voice
when
he
replied
and
was
relieved
to
know
the
old
man
dull
of
perception
for
now
ocock
had
finished
speaking
and
sat
perspiring
with
anxiety
to
learn
his
fate
mahony
pulled
himself
together
he
could
in
good
faith
tender
the
advice
to
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
whatever
the
original
fault
had
been
no
no
please
and
he
raised
an
arresting
hand
it
was
he
felt
sure
long
since
fully
atoned
and
ocock
had
said
a
true
word
women
were
strange
creatures
the
revelation
of
his
secret
might
shipwreck
his
happiness
it
also
of
course
might
not
and
personally
mahony
did
not
believe
it
would
for
ocock
buisness
throve
like
the
green
and
miss
tilly
had
been
promised
a
fine
house
with
and
a
garden
and
a
up
to
the
door
again
the
admission
might
be
accepted
in
peace
just
now
and
later
on
used
as
a
weapon
against
him
in
his
mahony
eyes
by
far
the
wisest
course
would
be
to
let
the
grass
grow
over
the
whole
affair
and
here
he
rose
abruptly
terminating
the
interview
you
and
i
too
sir
if
you
please
will
forget
what
has
passed
between
us
this
morning
and
never
come
back
on
it
how
is
tom
getting
on
in
the
drapery
business
does
he
like
his
billet
but
none
the
less
as
he
ushered
his
visitor
out
he
felt
that
there
was
a
certain
finality
about
the
action
it
was
as
far
as
his
private
feelings
were
concerned
the
old
man
moral
exit
from
the
scene
on
the
doorstep
ocock
hoped
that
nothing
that
had
been
said
would
reach
your
dear
little
lady
to
too
if
you
be
so
good
mum
the
word
never
forgive
me
nay
or
you
eether
if
it
got
to
i
bin
an
let
the
cat
outer
the
bag
an
got
a
bit
of
a
down
on
you
as
it
is
for
it
bin
your
place
i
met
the
future
o
at
my
good
man
broke
from
mahony
and
in
this
address
which
would
previously
never
have
crossed
his
lips
all
his
sensations
of
the
past
hour
were
summed
up
has
your
son
henry
the
he
checked
himself
does
he
suppose
i
i
or
my
wife
had
anything
to
do
with
it
he
turned
back
to
the
surgery
hot
with
annoyance
this
too
not
enough
that
he
must
be
put
out
of
countenance
by
indiscreet
babbling
he
must
also
get
drawn
into
family
squabbles
even
be
held
responsible
for
them
he
who
brooking
no
interference
in
his
own
life
demanded
only
that
those
about
him
should
be
as
intolerant
as
he
it
all
came
from
polly
indiscriminate
hospitality
his
house
was
never
his
own
and
now
they
had
the
prospect
of
john
and
his
electoral
campaign
before
them
and
john
chances
of
success
and
john
stump
oratory
and
the
other
people
were
expected
to
do
for
him
would
form
the
main
theme
of
conversation
for
many
a
day
to
come
glendinning
confirmed
old
ocock
words
she
came
to
talk
over
the
engagement
with
polly
and
sitting
in
the
parlour
cried
a
little
and
was
sorry
but
then
poor
little
agnes
cried
so
easily
nowadays
richard
said
her
nerves
had
been
shattered
by
the
terrible
affair
just
before
christmas
when
glendinning
had
tried
first
to
kill
her
and
then
to
cut
his
own
throat
agnes
said
but
i
told
henry
quite
plainly
darling
that
i
would
not
cease
my
visits
to
you
on
that
account
it
is
both
wrong
and
foolish
to
think
you
or
mahony
had
anything
to
do
with
it
and
after
the
doctor
was
so
kind
too
so
very
kind
about
getting
poor
glendinning
into
the
asylum
and
so
you
see
dear
henry
and
i
have
had
quite
a
disagreement
and
agnes
cried
again
at
the
remembrance
of
course
i
can
sympathise
with
his
point
of
view
henry
is
so
ambitious
all
the
same
dearest
it
not
quite
so
bad
is
it
as
he
makes
out
matilda
is
certainly
not
very
comme
il
faut
you
forgive
my
saying
so
love
wo
you
but
i
think
she
will
suit
henry
father
in
every
way
no
the
truth
is
the
old
gentleman
has
made
a
great
deal
of
money
and
we
naturally
expected
it
to
fall
to
henry
at
his
death
no
one
anticipated
his
marrying
again
not
that
henry
really
needs
the
money
he
is
getting
on
so
well
and
i
have
i
shall
have
plenty
too
by
and
by
but
you
know
love
what
men
are
dearest
agnes
do
fret
about
it
henry
thinks
too
much
of
you
i
sure
to
be
vexed
with
you
for
long
and
when
he
looks
at
it
calmly
he
see
how
unfair
it
is
to
make
us
responsible
i
like
you
dear
i
ca
consider
it
a
misfortune
tilly
is
not
a
lady
but
she
a
dear
girl
and
will
make
the
old
man
a
good
wife
i
only
hope
though
agnes
henry
wo
say
anything
to
richard
richard
is
so
touchy
about
things
of
that
sort
the
two
women
kissed
polly
with
feelings
of
the
tenderest
affection
the
fact
that
on
behalf
of
their
friendship
agnes
had
pitted
her
will
against
henry
endeared
her
to
polly
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
but
when
vigilant
as
a
she
sought
to
prepare
her
husband
for
a
possible
unpleasantness
she
found
him
already
informed
and
her
words
were
like
a
match
laid
to
his
suppressed
indignation
in
all
my
born
days
i
never
heard
such
impudence
he
turned
embarrassingly
cool
to
tilly
and
tilly
innocent
of
offence
and
quite
unskilled
in
deciphering
subtleties
put
this
sudden
change
of
front
down
to
jealousy
because
she
was
going
to
live
in
a
grander
house
than
he
did
for
the
same
reason
he
had
begun
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
old
or
she
was
very
much
mistaken
and
in
vain
did
polly
strive
to
convince
her
that
she
was
in
error
i
do
know
anyone
richard
has
a
higher
opinion
of
but
it
was
a
very
uncomfortable
state
of
things
and
when
a
message
arrived
over
the
electric
telegraph
announcing
the
dangerous
illness
of
beamish
distressed
though
she
was
by
the
news
polly
could
not
help
heaving
a
tiny
sigh
of
relief
for
tilly
was
summoned
back
to
melbourne
with
all
speed
if
she
wished
to
see
her
mother
alive
they
mingled
their
tears
polly
on
her
knees
at
the
packing
tilly
weeping
among
the
pillows
of
the
bed
if
it
only
been
pa
now
i
should
have
felt
it
half
so
much
and
she
blew
her
nose
for
the
hundredth
time
pa
was
always
such
a
rum
old
stick
but
poor
ma
when
i
think
how
she
toiled
and
moiled
whole
life
long
to
keep
things
going
she
all
the
pains
and
none
of
the
pleasures
and
now
just
when
i
was
hoping
to
be
able
to
give
a
helping
hand
this
must
happen
the
one
bright
spot
in
tilly
grief
was
that
the
journey
would
be
made
in
a
private
conveyance
ocock
had
bought
a
smart
gig
and
was
driving
her
down
himself
driving
past
the
foundations
of
the
new
house
along
the
seventy
odd
miles
of
road
right
up
to
the
door
of
the
mean
lodging
in
a
collingwood
back
street
where
the
old
beamishes
had
hidden
their
heads
if
only
she
able
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
see
me
dash
up
in
my
own
said
tilly
polly
fitted
out
a
substantial
and
was
keenest
sympathy
to
the
last
but
mahony
was
a
poor
dissembler
and
his
sudden
thaw
as
he
assisted
in
the
farewell
preparations
could
polly
feared
have
been
read
aright
by
a
child
tilly
hugged
polly
to
her
and
gave
her
kiss
after
kiss
i
shall
never
forget
kind
you
been
poll
and
all
you
done
for
me
i
had
my
disappointments
as
you
know
but
after
all
it
turn
out
to
be
for
the
best
one
o
the
good
sides
to
it
anyhow
is
that
you
and
me
be
neighbours
so
to
say
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
and
i
hope
to
see
something
of
you
my
dear
every
blessed
day
but
you
not
often
catch
me
coming
to
this
house
i
can
tell
you
that
for
if
you
wo
mind
me
saying
so
poll
i
think
you
got
one
of
the
queerest
sticks
for
a
husband
that
ever
walked
this
earth
blows
hot
one
day
and
cold
the
next
for
all
the
world
like
the
wind
in
spring
and
without
caring
twopence
whose
corns
treads
on
which
thought
polly
was
but
a
sorry
return
on
tilly
part
for
hospitality
after
all
it
was
his
house
she
had
been
a
guest
in
such
were
the
wheels
within
wheels
and
thus
it
came
about
that
when
the
question
rose
of
paving
the
way
for
john
turnham
candidature
mahony
drew
the
line
at
approaching
henry
ocock
chapter
x
john
drove
from
melbourne
in
a
drag
and
four
accompanied
by
numerous
friends
and
a
mile
or
so
out
of
ballarat
he
was
met
by
a
body
of
supporters
headed
by
a
brass
band
and
escorted
in
triumph
to
the
george
hotel
here
the
horses
having
been
led
away
john
at
once
took
the
field
by
mounting
the
of
the
coach
and
addressing
the
crowd
of
idlers
that
had
gathered
round
to
watch
the
arrival
he
got
an
excellent
hearing
so
jerry
reported
who
was
an
eye
and
of
the
scene
and
was
afterwards
borne
into
the
hotel
with
jerry
at
his
heels
mahony
called
at
the
hotel
that
evening
he
found
john
entertaining
a
large
impromptu
party
the
table
of
the
public
was
disorderly
with
the
remains
of
a
liberal
meal
napkins
lay
crushed
and
flung
down
among
plates
piled
high
with
empty
nutshells
the
cloth
was
and
bestrewn
with
ashes
and
breadcrumbs
the
air
heady
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
those
of
the
guests
who
still
lingered
at
the
table
had
pushed
their
chairs
back
or
askew
and
sat
some
some
even
with
their
feet
on
the
cloth
john
was
confabbing
with
half
a
dozen
in
a
corner
each
held
a
wineglass
in
his
hand
from
which
he
sipped
while
john
legs
apart
did
all
the
talking
every
now
and
then
putting
out
his
forefinger
to
prod
one
of
his
hearers
on
the
middle
button
of
the
waistcoat
it
was
some
time
before
he
discovered
the
presence
of
his
relatives
and
mahony
had
leisure
to
admire
the
fashion
in
which
this
over
john
dispersed
himself
among
the
company
drinking
with
this
one
and
that
glibly
answering
questions
patting
a
brewer
on
the
back
and
simultaneously
checking
over
with
an
agent
his
for
the
following
days
his
customary
arrogance
and
pompousness
of
manner
were
laid
aside
for
the
nonce
he
was
a
simple
man
among
men
then
espying
them
he
hurried
over
and
rubbing
his
hands
with
pleasure
said
warmly
my
dear
mahony
this
is
indeed
kind
jerry
my
lad
how
do
how
do
still
growing
i
see
we
make
a
fine
fellow
of
you
well
doctor
we
every
reason
i
think
to
feel
satisfied
with
the
lie
of
the
land
but
here
he
was
snatched
from
them
by
an
urgent
request
for
a
pronouncement
a
quite
informal
word
sir
if
you
be
so
good
on
the
vexed
question
of
vote
by
ballot
and
this
being
a
pet
theme
of
john
and
a
principle
he
was
ready
to
defend
through
thick
and
thin
he
willingly
complied
mahony
had
no
further
talk
with
him
the
speech
over
it
was
a
concise
and
spirited
utterance
and
if
you
were
prepared
to
admit
the
efficacy
of
the
ballot
convincing
enough
mahony
quietly
withdrew
he
had
to
see
a
patient
at
eleven
polly
too
would
probably
be
lying
awake
for
news
of
her
brother
as
he
threw
back
his
braces
and
wound
up
his
watch
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
warn
her
not
to
pitch
her
hopes
too
high
you
must
expect
my
dear
that
your
brother
arrival
will
mean
much
to
us
he
is
now
a
public
man
and
will
have
little
time
for
small
people
like
ourselves
i
bound
to
admit
polly
i
was
very
favourably
impressed
by
the
few
words
i
heard
him
say
he
added
oh
richard
i
so
glad
and
polly
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
stood
on
tiptoe
to
give
him
a
kiss
as
mahony
predicted
john
private
feelings
went
down
before
the
superior
interests
of
his
campaign
three
days
passed
before
he
found
time
to
pay
his
sister
a
visit
and
polly
who
had
postponed
a
washing
baked
her
richest
cakes
and
pastries
and
clad
trotty
in
her
sunday
best
each
day
of
the
three
polly
was
putting
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
consoling
herself
with
jerry
descriptions
of
triumphs
how
she
wished
she
could
hear
some
of
the
speechifying
but
richard
would
never
consent
and
electioneering
did
certainly
seem
from
what
jerry
said
a
very
business
nothing
for
ladies
hence
her
delight
knew
no
bounds
when
john
drove
up
unexpectedly
late
one
afternoon
between
a
hard
day
personal
canvassing
and
another
of
the
innumerable
dinners
he
had
to
eat
his
way
through
tossing
the
reins
to
the
gentleman
who
sat
next
him
he
jumped
out
of
the
wagonette
it
was
hung
with
placards
of
vote
for
turnham
and
gave
a
loud
at
the
door
forgetting
in
her
excitement
that
this
was
ellen
job
polly
opened
to
him
herself
and
drew
him
in
john
how
pleased
i
am
to
see
you
my
dear
girl
how
are
you
god
bless
me
how
you
altered
i
should
never
have
known
you
he
held
her
at
arm
length
to
consider
her
but
you
have
changed
in
the
least
john
except
to
grow
richard
here
john
at
last
and
trotty
john
here
trotty
take
your
thumb
out
of
your
mouth
naughty
girl
she
been
watching
for
you
all
day
john
with
her
nose
to
the
window
and
polly
pushed
forward
the
scarlet
shrinking
child
john
heartiness
suffered
a
distinct
check
as
his
eyes
lit
on
trotty
who
stood
stiff
as
a
bit
of
dresden
china
in
her
bunchy
starched
petticoats
come
here

and
let
me
look
at
you
taking
the
fat
little
chin
between
thumb
and
first
finger
he
turned
the
child
face
up
and
kept
it
so
till
the
red
button
of
a
mouth
trembled
and
the
great
blue
eyes
all
but
ran
over
h
yes
a
notable
resemblance
to
her
mother
ah
time
passes
polly
my
dear
time
passes
he
sighed
i
hope
you
mind
your
aunt
emma
and
are
properly
grateful
to
her
abruptly
quitting
his
hold
he
swept
the
parlour
with
a
glance
a
very
snug
little
place
you
have
here
upon
my
word
while
polly
with
trotty
pattering
after
bustled
to
the
larder
mahony
congratulated
his
on
the
more
favourable
attitude
towards
his
election
policy
which
was
becoming
evident
in
the
local
press
john
persuasive
tongue
was
clearly
having
its
effect
and
the
hostility
he
had
met
with
at
the
outset
of
his
candidature
was
yielding
to
more
friendly
feelings
on
all
sides
john
was
frankly
gratified
by
the
change
and
did
not
hesitate
to
say
so
when
the
wine
arrived
they
drank
to
his
success
and
polly
delicacies
met
with
their
due
share
of
praise
then
having
wiped
his
mouth
on
a
large
silk
handkerchief
john
disclosed
the
business
object
of
his
call
he
wanted
specific
information
about
the
more
influential
of
their
friends
and
acquaintances
and
here
he
drew
a
list
of
names
from
his
mahony
his
chin
propped
on
the
flaxen
head
of
the
child
whom
he
nursed
soon
fell
out
of
the
running
for
polly
proved
far
the
cleverer
at
grasping
the
nature
of
the
information
john
sought
and
at
retailing
it
and
john
complimented
her
on
her
shrewdness
ticked
off
names
took
notes
on
what
she
told
him
and
when
he
was
not
writing
sat
tapping
his
thick
underlip
and
nodding
assent
it
was
arranged
that
polly
should
drive
out
with
him
next
day
to
yarangobilly
by
way
of
dandaloo
while
for
the
evening
after
they
plotted
a
at
which
john
might
come
to
grips
with
archdeacon
long
john
expected
to
find
the
reverend
gentleman
a
hard
nut
to
crack
their
views
on
the
subject
of
a
state
aid
to
religion
being
diametrically
opposed
polly
thought
a
substantial
donation
to
the
might
smooth
things
over
while
for
john
to
display
a
personal
interest
in
charities
would
help
still
more
then
there
were
the
ococks
the
old
man
could
be
counted
on
she
believed
but
john
might
have
some
difficulty
with
henry
and
here
she
initiated
her
brother
into
the
domestic
differences
which
had
split
up
the
ocock
family
and
prevented
richard
from
approaching
the
lawyer
john
who
was
in
his
most
democratic
mood
was
humorous
at
the
expense
of
henry
and
declared
the
latter
should
rather
wish
his
father
joy
of
coming
to
such
a
fine
bouncing
young
wife
in
his
old
age
the
best
way
of
getting
at
henry
polly
considered
would
be
for
mrs
glendinning
to
give
a
luncheon
or
a
with
the
lawyer
among
the
guests
then
you
and
i
john
could
drive
out
and
join
them
either
by
chance
or
invitation
as
you
think
best
polly
was
heart
and
soul
in
the
affair
but
business
over
she
put
several
straight
questions
about
the
boy
little
johnny
polly
still
blamed
herself
for
having
meekly
submitted
to
the
child
removal
from
her
charge
and
was
not
to
be
fobbed
off
with
evasions
the
unfavourable
verdict
she
managed
to
worm
out
of
john
incorrigible
my
dear
polly
utterly
incorrigible
his
masters
report
him
idle
disobedient
a
bad
influence
on
the
other
scholars
she
met
staunchly
with
perhaps
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
school
why
not
try
another
johnny
had
his
good
qualities
in
many
ways
was
quite
a
lovable
child
for
the
first
time
mahony
saw
his
wife
and
her
eldest
brother
together
and
he
could
not
but
be
struck
by
polly
attitude
greatly
as
she
admired
and
reverenced
john
there
was
not
a
particle
of
obsequiousness
in
her
manner
nor
any
truckling
to
his
point
of
view
and
she
plainly
felt
nothing
of
the
peculiar
sense
of
discomfort
that
invariably
attacked
him
in
john
presence
either
she
was
not
conscious
of
her
brother
grossly
patronising
air
or
aware
of
it
did
not
resent
it
john
having
always
been
so
much
her
superior
in
age
and
position
or
was
it
indeed
the
truth
that
john
did
not
try
to
patronise
polly
that
his
overbearing
nature
recognised
in
hers
a
certain
springy
resistance
which
was
not
to
be
crushed
in
other
words
that
in
a
turnham
turnham
blood
met
its
match
john
his
seat
in
the
front
of
the
wagonette
trotty
was
lifted
up
to
see
the
rosettes
and
streamers
adorning
the
horses
the
gentlemen
waved
their
hats
and
off
they
went
again
at
a
fine
pace
and
with
a
that
brought
the
neighbours
to
their
windows
polly
had
pink
cheeks
with
it
all
and
even
sought
to
excuse
the
meagre
interest
john
had
shown
in
his
daughter
trotty
was
only
a
baby
in
arms
when
he
saw
her
last
besides
i
think
she
reminded
him
too
much
of
her
dear
mother
for
i
sure
though
he
does
let
it
be
seen
john
still
feels
his
loss
i
wonder
said
mahony
slowly
and
with
a
strong
downward
inflection
as
he
turned
indoors
on
the
eve
of
the
polling
polly
had
the
honour
of
accompanying
her
brother
to
a
performance
at
the
theatre
royal
a
ticket
came
for
richard
too
but
as
usual
he
was
at
the
last
moment
called
out
so
purdy
took
her
on
his
arm
and
escorted
her
not
exactly
comfortably
for
said
polly
no
one
who
had
not
tried
it
knew
how
hard
it
was
to
walk
with
a
lame
person
especially
if
you
did
not
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
purdy
took
her
to
the
theatre
helped
her
to
unmuffle
and
to
change
her
boots
and
bore
her
company
till
her
brother
arrived
they
had
seats
in
the
centre
of
the
front
row
of
the
dress
circle
all
eyes
were
turned
on
them
as
they
entered
and
appearance
was
the
subject
of
audible
and
embarrassing
comment
in
every
interval
john
was
up
and
away
to
shake
a
hand
here
pass
the
time
of
day
there
and
watching
him
with
affectionate
pride
polly
wondered
how
richard
could
ever
have
termed
him
and
difficult
john
had
the
knack
it
seemed
to
her
of
getting
on
with
people
of
every
class
and
of
always
finding
the
right
word
to
say
but
as
the
evening
advanced
his
seat
remained
empty
even
while
the
curtain
was
up
and
she
was
glad
when
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
acts
her
husband
at
last
appeared
on
his
way
to
her
mahony
ran
into
his
and
john
buttonholed
him
to
discuss
with
him
the
prospects
of
the
morrow
as
they
talked
their
eyes
rested
on
polly
glossy
black
chignon
on
the
nape
of
her
white
neck
on
the
beautiful
rounded
young
shoulders
which
in
obedience
to
the
fashion
stood
right
out
of
her
blue
silk
bodice
mahony
shifted
his
weight
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
he
could
not
imagine
polly
enjoying
her
exposed
position
and
disapproved
strongly
of
john
having
left
her
but
for
all
answer
to
the
hint
he
threw
out
john
said
slowly
and
with
a
somewhat
unctuous
relish
my
sister
has
turned
into
a
remarkably
handsome
woman
words
which
sent
the
through
mahony
that
had
polly
remained
the
insignificant
little
slip
of
a
thing
of
earlier
days
she
would
not
have
been
asked
to
fill
the
prominent
place
she
did
this
evening
john
sent
his
adieux
and
excuses
to
polly
he
had
done
what
was
expected
of
him
in
showing
himself
at
a
public
entertainment
and
a
vast
mass
of
correspondence
lay
unsorted
on
his
desk
so
mahony
moved
forward
alone
oh
richard
there
you
are
oh
dear
what
you
missed
i
never
thought
there
could
be
such
acting
and
polly
turned
her
great
dark
eyes
on
her
husband
they
were
moist
from
the
noble
sentiments
of
the
true
briton
the
day
of
the
election
broke
a
gusty
spring
day
cut
up
by
stinging
which
beat
like
fusillades
on
the
galvanised
iron
roofs
between
the
showers
the
sun
shone
in
a
sky
against
which
the
little
wooden
houses
showed
up
crassly
white
ballarat
made
holiday
early
as
mahony
left
home
he
met
a
long
line
of
conveyances
heading
townwards
spring
carts
dogcarts
double
and
single
buggies
in
some
of
which
built
to
seat
two
only
five
or
six
persons
were
huddled
these
and
similar
vehicles
drew
up
in
rows
outside
the
where
the
lean
colonial
horses
stood
jerking
at
their
tethers
and
they
were
still
there
still
jerking
when
he
passed
again
toward
evening
on
a
huge
poster
the
unicorn
offered
to
lunch
free
all
those
thinking
men
who
registered
their
vote
for
the
one
and
only
true
democrat
the
miners
friend
and
tyrants
foe
john
turnham
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
a
crush
mahony
drove
straight
to
the
but
already
all
the
loafers
and
roughs
in
the
place
seemed
to
be
congregated
round
the
entrance
after
the
polite
custom
of
the
country
to
chivy
or
boo
or
huzza
those
who
went
in
in
waiting
his
turn
he
had
to
listen
to
comments
on
his
dress
and
person
to
put
up
with
vulgar
allusions
to
blue
pills
and
black
draughts
just
as
he
was
getting
back
into
his
buggy
john
rode
up
flanked
by
a
bodyguard
of
friends
john
was
galloping
from
booth
to
booth
to
verify
progress
and
put
the
thumbscrew
on
wobblers
he
beamed
as
well
he
might
he
was
certain
to
be
one
of
the
two
members
elected
and
quite
likely
to
top
the
poll
by
a
respectable
majority
for
once
mahony
did
not
grumble
at
his
outlying
patients
was
only
too
thankful
to
turn
his
back
on
the
town
it
was
pandemonium
bands
of
music
one
shriller
and
more
discordant
than
the
next
marched
up
and
down
the
main
streets
from
the
fifes
and
drums
of
the
fire
brigade
to
the
and
of
mere
determined
straggling
processions
with
banners
that
bore
the
distorted
features
of
one
or
other
of
the
candidates
made
driving
difficult
and
to
add
to
the
confusion
the
schoolchildren
were
let
loose
to
overrun
the
place
and
fly
advertisement
balloons
round
every
and
so
it
went
on
till
far
into
the
night
the
dark
hours
being
varied
by
torchlight
processions
fireworks
free
fights
and
orgies
of
drunkenness
the
results
of
the
polling
were
promised
for
two
the
following
day
when
something
after
this
hour
mahony
reached
home
he
found
polly
and
the
gentle
jinny
beamish
who
was
the
present
occupant
of
the
spare
room
pacing
up
and
down
before
the
house
according
to
jerry
news
might
be
expected
now
at
any
minute
and
when
he
had
lunched
and
changed
his
coat
mahony
bitten
by
the
general
excitement
made
his
way
down
to
the
junction
of
sturt
street
and
the
flat
a
great
crowd
blocked
the
approaches
to
the
hustings
here
were
the
four
candidates
who
in
attending
the
issue
strove
to
look
decently
unconcerned
john
had
struck
a
attitude
his
right
elbow
propped
in
the
cup
of
his
left
hand
he
held
his
drooped
chin
between
thumb
and
forefinger
leaving
it
to
his
glancing
black
eyes
to
reveal
how
entirely
alive
he
was
to
the
gravity
of
the
moment
standing
on
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
mahony
listened
to
the
piebald
jokes
and
rude
wit
with
which
the
people
beguiled
the
interim
and
tried
to
endure
with
equanimity
the
jostling
the
profane
language
and
offensive
odours
by
which
he
was
assailed
half
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
returning
officer
climbed
the
ladder
at
the
back
of
the
platform
and
came
forward
to
announce
the
result
of
the
voting
john
millibank
turnham
topped
the
poll
with
a
majority
of
four
hundred
and
the
crowd
which
at
sight
of
the
clerk
had
abruptly
ceased
its
fooling
drowned
his
further
statements
in
a
roar
of
mingled
cheers
and
boos
the
cheers
had
it
hats
were
tossed
into
the
air
and
loud
cries
for
a
speech
arose
john
advance
to
grip
the
railing
led
to
a
fresh
outburst
in
which
the
weakening
opposition
was
quashed
by
the
singing
of
when
johnny
comes
marching
home
and
cheer
boys
cheer
for
home
and
mother
country
an
incongruity
of
sentiment
that
made
mahony
smile
and
john
having
repeatedly
bowed
his
thanks
from
side
to
side
joined
in
and
sang
with
the
rest
the
opening
of
his
speech
was
inaudible
to
mahony
just
behind
him
stood
one
of
his
most
arrant
opponents
a
butcher
by
trade
and
directly
john
began
to
hold
forth
this
man
produced
a
and
started
to
blow
it
in
vain
did
mahony
expostulate
he
seemed
to
have
got
into
a
very
of
hostility
for
the
player
friends
took
up
the
cudgels
and
baited
him
in
a
language
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
imitate
the
butcher
blaring
away
unmoved
with
the
fierce
solemnity
of
face
the
cornet
demands
mahony
lost
his
temper
his
tormentors
retaliated
and
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
though
there
would
be
trouble
then
a
number
of
john
supporters
enraged
by
the
bellowing
of
the
instrument
bore
down
and
forcibly
removed
the
musician
and
his
clique
mahony
along
with
them
having
indignantly
explained
and
shaken
coat
and
collar
to
rights
he
returned
to
his
place
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
the
speaker
deep
voice
had
gone
steadily
on
during
the
disturbance
indeed
john
might
have
been
born
to
the
hustings
interruptions
did
not
put
him
out
he
was
brilliant
at
repartee
and
all
the
stock
gestures
of
the
public
speaker
came
at
his
call
the
pounding
of
the
bowl
of
one
hand
with
the
closed
fist
of
the
other
the
dramatic
wave
of
the
arm
with
which
he
plumbed
the
depths
or
invited
defiance
the
jaunty
arms
akimbo
the
earnest
bend
from
the
waist
when
he
took
his
hearers
into
his
confidence
at
this
moment
he
was
gripping
the
rail
of
the
platform
as
though
he
intended
to
vault
it
and
asserting
our
first
cry
then
is
for
men
to
people
the
country
our
next
for
independence
to
work
out
our
own
salvation
yes
my
friends
the
glorious
future
of
this
young
and
prosperous
colony
which
was
once
and
most
auspiciously
known
as
australia
felix
blest
australia
rests
with
ourselves
alone
we
who
inhabit
here
can
best
judge
of
her
requirements
and
we
refuse
to
see
her
hampered
in
her
progress
by
the
shackles
of
an
ancient
tradition
what
suits
our
hoary
god
bless
and
keep
her
and
keep
us
loyal
to
her
is
but
dry
husks
for
us
england
knows
nothing
of
our
most
pressing
needs
i
ask
you
to
consider
how
previous
to
that
pretty
pair
of
mandarins
lord
john
russell
and
earl
grey
boggled
and
botched
the
crucial
question
of
unlocking
the
lands
even
yet
gentlemen
the
result
of
their
muddling
lies
heavy
on
us
and
the
land
question
though
first
in
importance
is
but
one
as
you
know
of
many
and
here
john
playing
on
the
tips
of
five
fingers
counted
them
off
he
wound
up
with
a
flaming
plea
for
the
creation
and
protection
of
purely
national
industries
for
what
i
would
ask
you
is
the
true
meaning
of
democracy
in
a
country
such
as
ours
what
is
for
us
the
democratic
principle
the
answer
my
friends
is
conservatism
yes
i
repeat
it
conservatism
and
thus
to
a
final
peroration
in
the
braying
and
hurrahing
that
followed
the
din
was
heightened
by
some
worthy
mounting
a
barrel
to
move
that
this
yere
johnny
turnham
was
not
a
fit
person
to
represent
the
constitooency
by
the
barrel
being
dragged
from
under
him
and
the
speaker
rolled
in
the
mud
while
this
went
on
mahony
stood
silent
and
he
was
still
standing
meditatively
pulling
his
whiskers
when
a
sudden
call
for
a
doctor
reached
his
ear
he
pushed
his
way
to
the
front
how
the
accident
happened
no
one
knew
john
had
descended
from
the
platform
to
a
verandah
where
countless
hands
were
stretched
out
to
shake
his
a
pile
of
shutters
was
leaning
against
the
wall
and
in
some
unexplained
fashion
these
had
fallen
striking
john
a
blow
that
knocked
him
down
when
mahony
got
to
him
he
was
on
his
feet
again
wiping
a
drop
of
blood
from
his
left
temple
he
looked
pale
but
injury
or
the
idea
of
interfering
with
his
audience
design
and
mahony
saw
him
shouldered
and
borne
off
that
evening
there
was
a
lengthy
banquet
in
which
all
the
notables
of
the
place
took
part
mahony
seat
was
some
way
off
john
he
had
to
lean
forward
did
he
wish
to
see
his
towards
eleven
just
as
he
was
wondering
if
he
could
slip
out
unobserved
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
arm
john
stood
behind
him
white
to
the
lips
can
i
have
a
word
with
you
upstairs
here
he
confessed
to
a
pain
in
his
left
side
the
brunt
of
the
blow
it
seemed
had
met
him
slantways
between
rib
and
hip
a
cursory
examination
made
mahony
look
grave
you
must
come
back
with
me
john
and
let
me
see
to
you
properly
having
expressed
the
chief
guest
regrets
to
the
company
he
ordered
a
horse
and
trap
and
helping
john
into
it
drove
him
home
and
that
night
john
lay
in
their
bed
letting
out
the
groans
he
had
suppressed
during
the
evening
while
polly
snatched
forty
winks
beside
jinny
beamish
and
mahony
got
what
sleep
he
could
on
the
parlour
sofa
chapter
xi
there
for
some
weeks
john
was
a
prisoner
with
a
fractured
rib
encased
in
strips
of
plaster
in
your
element
again
old
girl
mahony
chaffed
his
wife
when
he
met
her
bearing
invalid
trays
oh
it
does
all
fall
on
me
richard
jinny
a
great
help
sitting
with
john
and
keeping
him
company
mahony
could
see
it
for
himself
oftenest
when
he
entered
the
room
it
was
jinny
figure
she
was
in
mourning
for
her
parents
for
beamish
had
sunk
under
the
twofold
strain
of
failure
and
disgrace
and
the
day
after
her
death
it
had
been
necessary
to
cut
old
beamish
down
from
a
nail
oftenest
it
was
jinny
he
found
sitting
behind
a
curtain
of
the
watching
while
john
slept
ready
to
read
to
him
or
to
listen
to
his
talk
when
he
awoke
this
service
set
polly
free
to
devote
herself
to
the
extra
cooking
and
john
was
content
a
most
modest
and
unassuming
young
woman
ran
his
verdict
on
jinny
polly
reported
it
to
her
husband
in
high
glee
who
could
ever
have
believed
two
sisters
would
turn
out
so
differently
tilly
to
get
so
so
well
you
know
what
i
mean
and
jinny
to
improve
as
she
has
done
have
you
noticed
richard
she
hardly
ever
really
quite
seldom
now
drops
an
h
it
must
all
have
been
due
to
tilly
serving
in
that
low
bar
by
the
time
john
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
exchange
bed
for
sofa
it
had
come
to
be
exclusively
jinny
who
carried
in
to
him
the
dainties
polly
prepared
the
wife
as
usual
was
content
to
do
the
dirty
work
john
declared
miss
jinny
had
the
foot
of
a
fay
also
that
his
meals
tasted
best
at
her
hands
jinny
even
succeeded
in
making
trotty
fond
of
her
and
the
love
of
the
fat
shy
child
was
not
readily
won
entering
the
parlour
one
evening
mahony
surprised
quite
a
family
scene
john
stretched
on
the
sofa
was
stringing
jinny
sat
beside
him
with
trotty
on
her
knee
on
the
whole
though
the
child
did
not
warm
to
her
father
aunty
kin
dat
man
take
me
away
you
that
man
why
trotty
darling
he
your
father
said
polly
shocked
kin
take
me
away
you
and
uncle
papa
he
could
if
he
wanted
to
but
i
sure
he
does
answered
her
aunt
deftly
turning
a
sheet
of
pastry
and
righting
her
dolly
which
she
had
been
dragging
upside
down
trotty
let
slip
her
fears
with
the
sovereign
ease
of
childhood
from
the
kitchen
polly
could
hear
the
boom
of
john
deep
bass
it
made
nothing
of
the
walls
of
course
shut
up
as
he
was
he
had
to
talk
to
somebody
poor
fellow
and
richard
was
too
busy
to
spare
him
more
than
half
an
hour
of
an
evening
jinny
was
a
good
listener
through
the
crack
of
the
door
polly
could
see
her
sitting
humbly
drinking
in
john
words
and
even
looking
rather
pretty
in
her
fair
full
womanliness
oh
polly
she
burst
out
one
day
after
being
held
thus
spellbound
oh
my
dear
what
a
splendid
man
your
brother
is
i
feel
sometimes
i
could
sink
through
the
floor
with
shame
at
my
ignorance
when
talks
to
me
so
but
as
time
went
on
mahony
noticed
that
his
wife
grew
decidedly
thoughtful
and
if
john
continued
to
sing
jinny
praises
he
heard
nothing
more
of
it
he
had
an
acute
suspicion
what
troubled
polly
but
did
not
try
to
force
her
confidence
then
one
afternoon
on
his
getting
home
she
came
into
the
surgery
looking
very
perturbed
and
could
hardly
find
words
to
break
a
certain
piece
of
news
to
him
it
appeared
that
not
an
hour
previously
jinny
flushed
and
tearful
had
lain
on
her
neck
confessing
her
feelings
for
john
and
hinting
at
the
belief
that
they
were
returned
well
i
think
you
might
have
been
prepared
for
something
of
this
sort
polly
he
said
with
a
shrug
when
he
had
heard
her
out
convalescence
is
notoriously
dangerous
for
fanning
the
affections
oh
but
i
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
richard
jinny
is
a
dear
good
girl
and
all
that
but
she
is
not
john
equal
and
that
he
can
even
think
of
putting
her
in
poor
emma
place
what
shall
i
say
to
him
say
nothing
at
all
your
brother
john
is
not
the
man
to
put
up
with
interference
he
longs
so
for
a
real
home
again
polly
darling
said
jinny
wiping
her
eyes
and
how
it
will
make
me
to
fulfil
wish
do
let
me
feel
unwelcome
and
an
intruder
dear
i
know
i
not
nearly
good
enough
for
and
could
had
the
choice
of
ever
such
handsome
women
but
promised
to
be
patient
with
me
and
to
teach
me
everything
i
ought
to
know
polly
dismay
at
the
turn
of
events
yielded
to
a
womanly
sympathy
with
her
friend
it
just
like
poor
little
agnes
and
henry
over
again
was
her
private
thought
for
she
could
not
picture
john
stooping
to
guide
and
instruct
but
she
had
been
touched
on
a
tender
spot
that
of
ambitious
pride
for
those
related
to
her
and
she
made
what
mahony
called
a
real
turnham
attempt
to
stand
up
to
john
against
her
husband
express
advice
for
if
your
brother
chooses
to
contract
a
mesalliance
of
this
kind
it
nobody
business
but
his
own
upon
my
word
though
polly
if
you
do
take
care
this
house
will
get
a
bad
name
over
the
matches
that
are
made
in
it
you
had
better
have
your
spare
room
boarded
up
my
dear
mahony
was
feeling
particularly
rasped
by
john
behaviour
in
this
connection
having
been
nursed
back
to
health
john
went
about
with
his
chin
in
the
air
and
hardly
condescended
to
allude
to
his
engagement
let
alone
talk
it
over
with
his
relatives
so
mahony
retired
into
himself
after
all
the
world
of
john
mind
was
so
dissimilar
to
his
own
that
he
did
not
even
care
to
know
what
went
on
in
it
the
fellow
has
been
caught
on
the
hop
by
a
buxom
form
and
a
languishing
eye
was
how
he
dismissed
the
matter
in
thought
i
raise
my
wife
to
my
own
station
mary
and
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
by
showing
jane
every
possible
attention
was
the
only
satisfaction
polly
could
get
from
john
made
in
his
driest
tone
before
the
engagement
was
a
week
old
tilly
reappeared
she
was
to
be
married
from
their
house
on
the
hither
side
of
christmas
at
first
she
was
too
full
of
herself
and
her
own
affairs
to
let
either
polly
or
jinny
get
a
word
in
just
to
think
of
it
that
old
devine
had
gone
and
bought
the
block
of
land
next
the
one
was
building
on
she
lay
a
bet
he
would
put
up
a
house
the
dead
spit
of
theirs
did
ever
anyone
hear
such
cheek
at
the
news
that
was
broken
to
her
the
first
time
she
paused
for
breath
she
let
herself
heavily
down
on
a
chair
well
i
blowed
was
all
she
could
ejaculate
blowed
what
i
am
but
afterwards
when
jinny
had
left
the
room
she
gave
free
play
to
a
very
real
envy
and
regret
in
all
my
life
i
never
did
jinn
to
be
john
and
as
like
as
not
the
honourable
john
before
done
oh
polly
my
dear
why
ever
did
i
wait
on
being
presented
to
john
however
she
became
more
reconciled
to
her
lot
got
a
temper
your
brother
has
or
i
very
much
mistaken
it
wo
be
all
beer
and
skittles
for
ladyship
for
jinn
has
a
scrap
of
spunk
in
polly
she
got
so
mopey
the
last
year
or
two
there
was
no
doing
anything
with
now
it
was
just
the
other
way
round
with
me
no
matter
how
black
things
looked
i
always
kept
my
pecker
up
poor
ma
used
to
say
i
grew
more
like
her
every
day
and
at
a
still
later
date
no
polly
my
dear
i
would
change
places
with
the
future
after
all
thank
you
not
for
joseph
i
say
she
need
to
mind
her
p
and
q
for
tilly
had
listened
to
john
explaining
to
jinny
what
he
expected
of
her
what
she
might
and
might
not
do
and
had
watched
jinny
sitting
meekly
by
and
saying
yes
to
everything
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
the
marriage
indeed
did
it
not
take
place
immediately
jinny
would
have
to
look
about
her
for
a
situation
of
some
kind
and
said
john
that
was
nothing
for
his
wife
his
house
stood
empty
he
was
very
much
in
love
and
pressed
for
the
naming
of
the
day
so
it
was
decided
that
polly
should
accompany
jinny
to
lodgings
in
melbourne
help
her
choose
her
trousseau
and
engage
servants
afterwards
there
would
be
a
quiet
wedding
by
reason
of
jinny
mourning
at
which
richard
if
he
could
possibly
contrive
to
leave
his
patients
would
give
the
bride
away
polly
was
to
remain
in
john
house
while
the
happy
couple
were
on
honeymoon
to
look
after
the
servants
this
arrangement
would
also
make
the
break
less
hard
for
the
child
trotty
was
still
blissfully
unconscious
of
what
had
befallen
her
she
had
learnt
to
say
new
mamma
without
understanding
what
the
words
meant
and
meanwhile
the
fact
that
she
was
to
go
with
her
aunt
for
a
long
exciting
filled
her
childish
cup
with
happiness
as
polly
packed
the
little
clothes
she
thought
of
the
night
six
years
before
when
the
fat
sleeping
babe
had
been
laid
in
her
arms
of
course
it
only
natural
john
should
want
his
family
round
him
again
but
i
shall
miss
the
dear
little
soul
she
said
to
her
husband
who
stood
watching
her
what
you
need
is
a
little
one
of
your
own
wife
ah
do
i
wish
i
had
said
polly
and
drew
a
sigh
that
would
make
up
for
everything
still
if
it
ca
be
it
ca
a
few
days
before
the
set
time
john
received
an
urgent
summons
to
melbourne
and
went
on
ahead
leaving
mahony
suspecting
him
of
a
dodge
to
avoid
travelling
en
famille
in
order
that
his
should
not
be
put
to
inconvenience
john
hired
four
seats
for
the
three
of
them
but
he
might
just
as
well
have
saved
his
money
thought
polly
when
she
saw
the
coach
despite
their
protests
they
were
packed
like
herrings
in
a
barrel
had
hardly
enough
room
to
use
their
hands
altogether
it
was
a
trying
journey
jinny
worked
on
by
excitement
and
fatigue
took
a
fit
of
hysterics
trotty
frightened
by
the
many
rough
strangers
cried
and
had
to
be
nursed
and
the
whole
burden
of
the
undertaking
lay
on
polly
shoulders
she
had
felt
rather
timid
about
it
before
starting
but
was
obliged
to
confess
she
got
on
better
than
she
expected
a
kind
old
man
sitting
opposite
for
instance
a
splitter
he
said
he
was
actually
undid
jinny
and
fetched
water
for
her
at
the
first
stoppage
polly
had
not
been
in
melbourne
since
the
year
after
her
marriage
and
was
looking
forward
intensely
to
the
visit
she
went
laden
with
commissions
her
gave
her
a
list
as
long
as
her
arm
richard
too
had
entrusted
her
to
get
him
editions
of
various
medical
works
as
well
as
a
new
stethoscope
thirdly
she
had
promised
old
ocock
to
go
to
william
town
to
meet
miss
amelia
who
even
now
was
tossing
somewhere
on
the
indian
ocean
and
to
escort
the
poor
young
lady
up
to
ballarat
having
seen
them
start
mahony
went
home
to
drink
his
coffee
and
read
his
paper
in
a
quiet
that
was
new
to
him
john
departure
had
already
eased
the
strain
then
tilly
had
been
boarded
out
at
the
methodist
minister
now
with
the
exit
of
polly
and
her
charges
a
great
peace
descended
on
the
little
house
the
rooms
lay
white
and
still
in
the
sun
and
though
all
doors
stood
open
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
but
the
buzzing
of
the
blowflies
round
the
sweets
of
the
flytraps
he
was
free
to
look
as
glum
as
he
chose
of
a
morning
if
he
had
neuralgia
or
to
be
silent
when
worried
over
a
troublesome
case
no
longer
would
miss
tilly
bulky
presence
and
reiterations
of
her
prospects
grate
his
nerves
or
john
absorption
in
himself
and
poor
foolish
jinny
quavering
doubts
whether
she
would
ever
be
able
to
live
up
to
so
magnificent
a
husband
offend
his
sense
of
decorum
another
reason
he
was
glad
to
see
the
last
of
them
was
that
in
the
long
run
he
had
rebelled
at
the
barefaced
way
they
made
use
of
polly
and
took
advantage
of
her
good
nature
she
had
not
only
cooked
for
them
and
waited
on
them
he
had
even
caught
her
stitching
garments
for
the
helpless
jinny
this
was
too
much
such
extreme
obligingness
on
his
wife
part
seemed
to
detract
from
her
personal
dignity
he
could
never
though
have
got
polly
to
see
it
undignified
to
do
a
kindness
what
a
funny
selfish
idea
the
fact
was
there
was
a
certain
streak
in
polly
nature
that
made
her
more
akin
to
all
these
good
people
than
to
him
him
with
his
unsociable
leanings
towards
a
hermit
cell
his
genuine
need
of
an
occasional
hour
privacy
and
silence
in
which
to
think
a
few
thoughts
through
to
the
end
on
coming
in
from
his
rounds
he
turned
out
an
old
linen
jacket
that
belonged
to
his
bachelor
days
and
raked
up
some
books
he
had
not
opened
for
an
almost
equally
long
time
he
also
steered
clear
of
friends
and
acquaintances
went
nowhere
saw
no
one
but
his
patients
and
ellen
to
whose
cookery
polly
had
left
him
with
many
misgivings
took
things
easy
he
so
busy
reading
he
never
knows
what
he
puts
in
his
mouth
i
believe
he
eat
his
if
i
fried
up
neat
wid
a
bit
of
parsley
she
reported
over
the
back
fence
on
doctor
odd
ways
during
the
winter
months
the
practice
had
as
usual
fallen
off
by
now
it
was
generally
beginning
to
look
up
again
but
this
year
for
some
reason
the
slackness
persisted
he
saw
how
lean
his
purse
was
whenever
he
had
to
take
a
banknote
from
it
to
enclose
to
polly
there
was
literally
nothing
doing
no
money
coming
in
then
he
would
restlessly
lay
his
book
aside
and
drawing
a
slip
of
paper
to
him
set
to
reckoning
and
dividing
not
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
in
the
doctor
awkward
quandary
how
to
be
decently
and
humanly
glad
of
a
rise
in
the
he
had
often
regretted
having
held
to
the
shares
he
had
bought
at
henry
ocock
suggestion
had
often
spent
in
fancy
the
sum
they
would
have
brought
in
had
he
sold
when
they
touched
their
highest
figure
such
a
chance
would
hardly
come
his
way
again
after
the
one
fictitious
porepunkahs
had
fallen
heavily
the
first
main
at
a
depth
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
had
failed
to
strike
the
gutter
and
nowadays
they
were
not
even
quoted
thus
had
ended
his
single
attempt
to
take
a
hand
in
the
great
game
one
morning
he
sat
at
breakfast
and
thought
over
his
weekly
epistle
to
polly
in
general
this
chronicled
items
of
merely
personal
interest
the
house
had
not
yet
been
burnt
down
her
constant
fear
when
absent
another
doctor
had
got
the
asylum
he
himself
stood
a
chance
of
being
elected
to
the
committee
of
the
district
hospital
however
there
was
more
to
tell
the
english
mail
had
come
in
and
the
table
was
strewn
with
foreign
envelopes
and
journals
besides
the
usual
letters
from
relatives
one
in
a
queer
illiterate
hand
had
reached
him
the
address
scrawled
in
purple
ink
on
the
cheapest
opening
it
with
some
curiosity
mahony
found
that
it
was
from
his
former
assistant
long
jim
the
old
man
wrote
in
a
dismal
strain
everything
had
gone
against
him
his
wife
had
died
he
was
out
of
work
and
penniless
and
racked
with
rheumatism
oh
it
was
a
crewl
climat
did
he
stop
in
england
only
the
house
remained
to
him
he
end
in
a
pauper
grave
but
he
believed
if
he
could
get
back
to
a
scrap
of
warmth
and
the
sun
he
be
good
for
some
years
yet
now
he
always
known
mahony
for
the
kindest
most
liberal
of
gentlemen
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
had
been
spent
under
him
on
the
flat
and
if
he
only
give
him
a
lift
now
there
was
nothing
he
would
do
to
show
his
gratitude
doctor
knew
a
bit
about
him
too
here
he
could
seem
to
get
on
with
folk
at
all
they
looked
crooked
at
him
and
just
because
he
once
been
spunky
enough
to
try
his
luck
overseas
mahony
pshawed
and
smiled
then
wondered
what
polly
would
say
to
this
letter
she
it
was
who
had
been
responsible
for
packing
the
old
man
off
unfolding
the
star
he
ran
his
eye
over
its
columns
he
had
garnered
the
chief
local
news
and
was
skimming
the
mining
intelligence
when
he
suddenly
stopped
short
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
his
grip
on
the
paper
tightened
there
it
stood
black
on
white
porepunkahs
had
jumped
to
three
pounds
per
share
what
the
dickens
did
that
mean
he
turned
back
to
the
front
sheet
to
find
if
any
clue
to
the
renewed
activity
had
escaped
him
but
sought
in
vain
so
bolting
the
rest
of
his
breakfast
he
hurried
down
to
the
town
to
see
if
on
the
spot
he
could
pick
up
information
with
regard
to
the
mysterious
rise
the
next
few
days
kept
him
in
a
twitter
of
excitement
porepunkahs
went
on
advancing
not
by
leaps
and
bounds
as
before
but
slowly
and
steadily
and
threw
off
a
dividend
he
got
into
bed
at
night
with
a
hot
head
from
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
hold
on
or
sell
out
and
inside
a
week
he
was
off
to
consult
the
one
person
who
was
in
a
position
to
advise
him
henry
ocock
greeting
resembled
an
embrace
it
evidently
means
a
fortune
for
him
and
all
trifling
personal
differences
were
forgotten
in
the
wider
common
bond
the
lawyer
virtually
ordered
mahony
to
sit
in
till
he
gave
the
word
by
this
time
porepunkahs
had
passed
their
previous
limit
and
even
paid
a
bonus
it
was
now
an
open
secret
that
a
drive
undertaken
in
an
opposite
direction
to
the
first
had
proved
successful
the
lead
was
scored
and
seamed
with
gold
ocock
spoke
of
the
stone
specimens
of
which
he
had
held
in
his
hand
declared
he
had
never
seen
its
equal
but
when
the
shares
stood
at
pounds
each
mahony
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
and
in
spite
of
ocock
belief
that
another
ten
days
would
see
a
coup
he
parted
with
of
the
half
hundred
he
held
leaving
the
odd
money
with
the
lawyer
for
he
walked
out
of
the
office
the
possessor
of
two
thousand
pounds
it
was
only
a
very
ordinary
late
spring
day
the
season
brought
its
like
by
the
score
a
pale
azure
sky
against
which
the
distant
hills
looked
purple
above
these
a
narrow
belt
of
cloud
touched
in
its
curves
to
the
same
hue
but
to
mahony
it
seemed
as
if
such
a
perfect
day
had
never
dawned
since
he
first
set
foot
in
australia
his
back
was
eased
of
its
burden
and
like
christian
on
having
passed
the
wall
known
as
salvation
he
could
have
wept
tears
of
joy
after
all
these
years
of
pinching
and
sparing
he
was
out
of
poverty
grip
the
suddenness
of
the
thing
was
what
staggered
him
he
might
have
drudged
till
his
hair
was
grey
it
was
unlikely
he
would
ever
at
one
stroke
have
come
into
possession
of
a
sum
like
and
that
whole
day
he
went
about
feeling
a
little
more
than
human
and
seeing
people
places
things
through
a
kind
of
beatific
mist
now
thank
god
he
could
stand
on
his
own
legs
again
could
relieve
john
of
his
bond
pay
off
the
mortgage
on
the
house
insure
his
life
before
it
was
too
late
and
everything
done
he
would
still
have
over
a
thousand
pounds
to
his
credit
a
thousand
pounds
no
longer
need
he
thankfully
accept
any
and
every
call
or
reckon
sourly
that
if
the
leakage
on
the
roof
was
to
be
mended
he
must
go
without
a
new
surtout
best
of
all
he
could
now
begin
in
earnest
to
save
first
though
he
allowed
himself
two
very
special
pleasures
he
sent
polly
a
message
on
the
electric
telegraph
to
say
that
he
would
come
down
himself
to
fetch
her
home
in
secret
he
planned
a
little
trip
to
schnapper
point
at
the
time
of
john
wedding
he
had
been
unable
to
get
free
this
would
be
the
first
holiday
he
and
polly
had
ever
had
together
the
second
thing
he
did
was
to
indulge
the
love
of
giving
that
was
innate
in
him
and
of
giving
in
a
somewhat
lordly
way
he
enjoyed
the
broad
grin
that
illumined
ellen
face
at
his
generosity
jerry
red
stammered
thanks
for
the
gift
of
the
cob
the
boy
had
long
coveted
it
did
him
good
to
put
two
notes
in
an
envelope
and
inscribe
ned
name
on
it
he
had
never
yet
been
able
to
do
anything
for
these
poor
lads
he
also
without
waiting
to
consult
polly
fearing
indeed
that
she
might
advise
against
it
sent
off
the
money
to
long
jim
for
the
outward
voyage
and
a
few
pounds
over
for
there
were
superstitious
depths
in
him
and
at
this
turn
in
his
fortunes
it
would
surely
be
of
ill
omen
to
refuse
the
first
appeal
for
help
that
reached
him
polly
was
so
much
a
part
of
himself
that
he
thought
of
her
last
of
all
but
then
it
was
with
moist
eyes
she
who
had
never
complained
should
of
a
surety
not
come
short
and
he
dropped
asleep
that
night
to
the
happy
refrain
now
she
shall
have
her
piano
god
bless
her
the
best
that
money
can
buy

iv
chapter
i
the
new
house
stood
in
webster
street
it
was
twice
as
large
as
the
old
one
had
a
garden
back
and
front
a
verandah
round
three
sides
when
mahony
bought
it
and
the
piece
of
ground
it
stood
on
it
was
an
unpretentious
in
a
rather
dilapidated
condition
the
situation
was
good
though
without
being
too
far
from
his
former
address
and
there
was
stabling
for
a
pair
of
horses
and
by
the
time
he
had
finished
with
it
it
was
one
of
those
characteristically
australian
houses
which
added
to
wherever
feasible
without
a
thought
for
symmetry
or
design
a
room
built
on
here
a
covered
passage
there
a
bathroom
thrown
out
in
an
unexpected
corner
with
odd
steps
up
and
down
have
yet
a
spacious
straggling
comfort
all
their
own
how
glad
he
was
to
leave
the
tiny
sunbaked
box
that
till
now
had
been
his
home
it
had
had
neither
blind
nor
shutter
and
on
his
entering
it
of
a
summer
midday
it
had
sometimes
struck
hotter
than
outside
the
windows
of
his
new
room
were
fitted
with
green
venetians
round
the
twined
respectively
a
banksia
and
a
japanese
which
further
damped
the
glare
while
on
the
patch
of
in
front
stood
a
spreading
that
leafed
well
and
threw
a
fine
shade
he
had
also
added
a
sofa
to
his
equipment
now
when
he
came
in
tired
or
with
a
headache
he
could
stretch
himself
at
full
length
he
was
lying
on
it
at
this
moment
polly
too
had
reason
to
feel
satisfied
with
the
change
a
handsome
little
broadwood
with
a
and
front
stood
against
the
wall
of
her
gilt
cornices
surmounted
the
windows
and
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
hung
a
that
was
the
envy
of
every
one
who
saw
it
henry
ocock
was
not
a
patch
on
it
and
yet
had
cost
more
this
time
mahony
had
virtually
been
able
to
give
his
wife
a
free
hand
in
her
furnishing
and
in
her
new
spare
room
she
could
put
up
no
less
than
three
guests
of
course
these
luxuries
had
not
all
rained
on
them
at
once
several
months
passed
before
polly
on
the
threshold
of
her
parlour
could
exclaim
with
an
artlessness
that
touched
her
husband
deeply
never
in
my
life
did
i
think
i
should
have
such
a
beautiful
room
still
as
regarded
money
the
whole
year
had
been
a
steady
ascent
the
he
had
left
with
the
lawyer
had
served
its
purpose
of
chaining
that
old
hen
fortune
to
the
spot
ocock
had
invested
and
on
his
behalf
now
it
was
twenty
now
thirty
consolidated
beehives
and
mahony
was
continually
being
agreeably
surprised
by
the
margins
it
threw
off
in
its
metamorphoses
that
came
of
his
having
placed
the
matter
in
such
competent
hands
the
lawyer
had
for
instance
got
him
finally
out
of
porepunkahs
in
the
nick
of
time
the
reef
had
not
proved
as
open
to
the
day
as
was
expected
and
pulled
him
off
in
the
process
another
three
hundred
odd
compared
with
own
takings
of
course
his
was
a
modest
spoil
the
lawyer
had
made
a
fortune
and
was
now
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
ballarat
he
had
built
not
only
new
and
handsome
offices
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
but
also
prior
to
his
marriage
a
fine
standing
in
extensive
grounds
on
the
farther
side
of
yuille
swamp
altogether
it
had
been
a
year
of
great
and
sweeping
changes
people
had
gone
up
gone
down
had
changed
places
like
children
at
a
game
of
general
post
more
than
one
of
mahony
acquaintances
had
burnt
his
fingers
on
the
other
hand
old
devine
polly
had
made
his
thousands
there
was
actually
talk
of
his
standing
for
parliament
in
which
case
his
wife
bid
fair
to
be
received
at
government
house
and
the
pair
of
them
with
hardly
an
h
between
them
from
the
sofa
where
he
lay
mahony
could
hear
the
murmur
of
his
even
voice
polly
sat
the
further
end
of
the
verandah
talking
to
jinny
who
dandled
her
babe
in
a
that
made
a
light
as
it
went
to
and
fro
jinny
said
nothing
she
was
no
doubt
sunk
in
adoration
of
her
or
rather
john
infant
and
mahony
all
but
dozed
off
under
the
full
round
tones
he
knew
so
well
in
his
case
the
saying
had
once
more
been
verified
to
him
that
hath
shall
be
given
whether
it
was
due
to
the
better
position
of
the
new
house
or
to
the
fact
that
easier
circumstances
gave
people
more
leisure
to
think
of
their
ailments
or
merely
that
money
attracted
money
whatever
the
cause
his
practice
had
of
late
made
giant
strides
he
was
in
demand
for
consultations
sat
on
several
committees
while
a
couple
of
lodges
had
come
his
way
as
good
as
unsought
against
this
he
had
one
piece
of
to
set
at
the
close
of
the
summer
when
the
hot
winds
were
in
blast
he
had
gone
down
under
the
worst
attack
of
dysentery
he
had
had
since
the
early
days
he
really
thought
this
time
all
was
over
with
him
for
six
weeks
in
spite
of
the
tenderest
nursing
he
had
lain
prostrate
and
as
soon
as
he
could
bear
the
journey
had
to
prescribe
himself
a
change
to
the
seaside
the
bracing
air
of
queenscliff
soon
picked
him
up
he
had
thank
god
a
marvellous
faculty
of
recuperation
while
others
were
still
not
done
pitying
him
he
was
himself
again
and
well
enough
to
take
the
daily
plunge
in
the
sea
that
was
one
of
his
dearest
to
feel
the
warm
stinging
fluid
lap
him
round
after
all
these
drewthy
years
of
dust
and
heat
he
could
not
have
enough
of
it
and
stayed
so
long
in
the
water
that
his
wife
sitting
at
a
decent
distance
from
the
bathing
enclosure
grew
anxious
and
agitated
her
little
white
parasol
there
nothing
to
equal
it
mary
this
side
heaven
he
declared
as
he
rejoined
her
his
towel
about
his
neck
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
try
a
dip
my
dear
but
mary
preferred
to
sit
quietly
on
the
beach
the
dressing
and
undressing
is
such
a
trouble
said
she
as
it
was
one
of
her
was
full
of
sand
yes
polly
was
mary
now
and
had
been
since
the
day
ned
turned
up
again
on
ballarat
accompanied
by
a
wife
and
child
mary
was
in
melbourne
at
the
time
at
john
nuptials
mahony
had
opened
the
door
himself
to
ned
knock
and
there
in
a
sat
the
frowsy
woman
who
was
come
to
steal
his
wife
name
from
her
this
invasion
was
the
direct
result
of
his
impulsive
generosity
had
he
only
kept
his
money
in
his
pocket
he
had
been
forced
to
take
the
trio
in
and
give
them
but
he
bore
the
storming
of
his
privacy
with
a
bad
grace
and
mary
had
much
to
gloss
over
on
her
return
she
had
been
greatly
distressed
by
her
favourite
marriage
for
if
they
had
not
held
jinny
to
be
equal
what
was
to
be
said
of
ned
choice
ned
had
lived
among
the
mining
population
of
castlemaine
where
her
father
kept
a
and
said
richard
her
manners
were
accordingly
loud
familiar
before
she
had
been
hours
under
his
roof
she
was
bluntly
addressing
him
as
mahony
there
was
also
a
peculiar
streak
of
touchiness
in
her
nature
goes
with
hair
of
that
colour
my
dear
which
rendered
her
extremely
hard
to
deal
with
she
had
it
seemed
opposed
the
idea
of
moving
to
ballarat
that
was
all
in
her
favour
said
mary
and
came
primed
to
detect
a
snub
or
a
slight
at
every
turn
this
morbid
suspiciousness
it
was
that
led
mary
to
yield
her
rights
in
the
matter
of
the
name
the
confusion
between
them
was
and
at
the
first
hint
that
the
change
would
come
gracefully
from
her
ned
had
flown
into
a
passion
it
all
the
same
to
me
richard
what
i
called
mary
soothed
him
and
do
you
think
polly
was
beginning
to
sound
rather
childish
now
i
nearly
but
oh
what
could
ned
have
seen
in
her
she
sighed
to
herself
dismayed
for
ned
was
at
least
ten
years
older
than
her
husband
and
whatever
affection
might
originally
have
existed
between
them
was
now
a
thing
of
the
past
she
tyrannised
mercilessly
over
him
nagging
at
him
till
ned
who
was
nothing
if
not
turned
sullen
and
left
off
tossing
his
child
in
the
air
we
must
just
make
the
best
of
it
richard
said
mary
after
all
she
really
fond
of
the
baby
and
when
the
second
comes
attend
her
yourself
wo
you
dear
i
think
somehow
her
temper
may
improve
when
that
over
for
this
was
another
thing
ned
had
arrived
there
in
a
condition
that
raised
distressing
doubts
in
mary
as
to
the
dates
of
marriage
and
the
birth
of
his
first
child
she
did
not
breathe
them
to
richard
for
it
seemed
to
her
only
to
make
matters
of
this
kind
worse
openly
to
speak
of
them
she
devoted
herself
to
getting
the
little
family
under
a
roof
of
its
own
through
richard
influence
ned
obtained
a
clerkship
in
a
which
would
just
keep
his
head
above
water
and
she
found
a
tiny
house
that
was
near
enough
to
let
her
be
daily
with
her
when
the
latter
time
came
meanwhile
she
cut
out
and
helped
to
sew
a
complete
little
outfit
what
she
had
before
was
no
better
than
rags
and
ned
soon
learned
to
know
on
whom
she
could
lean
and
to
whom
she
might
turn
not
only
for
practical
aid
but
also
for
a
never
failing
sympathy
in
what
she
called
her
troubles
i
vow
your
mary
the
little
soul
it
ever
been
me
luck
to
run
across
she
averred
one
day
to
mahony
who
was
visiting
her
professionally
so
too
no
nonsense
about
her
i
should
have
thought
a
gaby
like
ned
could
have
sported
such
trump
of
a
sister
another
pensioner
for
your
caritas
dear
said
mahony
in
passing
on
the
verdict
what
he
did
not
grieve
his
wife
by
repeating
were
certain
bad
reports
of
ned
lately
brought
him
by
jerry
according
to
jerry
and
the
boy
word
was
to
be
relied
on
ned
had
kept
loose
company
in
castlemaine
and
had
acquired
the
habit
of
taking
more
than
was
good
for
him
did
he
not
speedily
amend
his
ways
there
would
be
small
chance
of
him
remaining
in
his
present
post
here
mahony
was
effectually
roused
by
a
stir
on
the
verandah
jinny
had
entered
the
house
to
lay
down
her
sleeping
babe
and
a
third
voice
purdy
became
audible
the
wife
had
evidently
brought
out
a
bottle
of
her
famous
gingerbeer
he
heard
the
cork
pop
the
drip
of
the
overflow
on
the
boards
the
clink
of
the
empty
glass
and
warm
words
of
appreciation
then
there
was
silence
rising
from
the
sofa
mahony
inserted
himself
between
blind
and
window
and
peeped
out
his
first
thought
was
what
a
picture
mary
wore
a
pale
pink
cotton
gown
which
over
the
light
swellings
of
her
crinoline
bulged
and
billowed
round
her
and
generously
swept
the
ground
collar
and
cuffs
of
spotless
lawn
outlined
neck
and
wrists
she
bent
low
over
her
stitching
and
the
straight
white
parting
of
her
hair
intensified
the
ebony
of
the
glossy
bands
her
broad
pure
forehead
had
neither
line
nor
stain
on
the
trellis
behind
her
a
vine
hung
laden
with
massy
bunches
of
muscatelles
purdy
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
verandah
with
his
back
to
mahony
between
thumb
and
forefinger
he
idly
swung
a
pair
of
scissors
urged
by
some
occult
sympathy
mary
at
once
glanced
up
and
discovered
her
husband
her
face
was
lightly
flushed
from
stooping
and
the
least
touch
of
colour
was
enough
to
give
its
delicate
ivory
an
appearance
of
vivid
health
she
had
grown
fuller
of
late
quite
fat
said
richard
when
he
wished
to
tease
her
a
luxuriant
young
womanliness
lay
over
and
about
her
now
above
the
pale
of
her
cheeks
her
black
eyes
danced
with
a
mischievous
glee
for
she
believed
her
husband
intended
swinging
his
leg
noiselessly
over
the
sill
and
creeping
up
to
startle
purdy
and
this
appealed
to
her
sense
of
humour
but
as
he
remained
standing
at
the
window
she
just
smiled
slyly
satisfied
to
be
in
communion
with
him
over
their
unsuspecting
friend
head
here
however
purdy
brought
his
eyes
back
from
the
garden
and
she
abruptly
dropped
hers
to
her
needlework
the
scissors
were
shut
with
a
snap
and
thrown
rather
than
laid
to
the
other
implements
in
the
workbox
one
think
you
were
paid
to
finish
that
wretched
sewing
in
a
fixed
time
polly
said
purdy
cantankerously
have
you
got
a
word
to
say
it
for
the
dorcas
society
they
having
a
sale
of
work
oh
damn
dorcases
you
always
slaving
for
somebody
you
ruin
your
eyes
i
wonder
dick
allows
it
i
should
i
know
that
the
peal
of
laughter
that
greeted
these
words
came
equally
from
husband
and
wife
then
what
the
dickens
does
it
matter
to
you
sir
how
much
sewing
my
wife
chooses
to
do
cried
mahony
and
still
laughing
stepped
out
of
the
window
hello
you
there
said
purdy
and
rose
to
his
feet
what
a
beastly
fright
to
give
one
he
looked
red
and
sulky
i
scored
that
time
my
boy
and
linking
his
arm
in
mary
mahony
confronted
his
friend
afraid
i
neglecting
my
duties
are
you
letting
this
young
woman
spoil
her
eyes
turn
on
him
my
love
in
all
their
splendour
that
he
may
judge
for
himself
nonsense
richard
said
mary
softly
but
with
an
affectionate
squeeze
of
his
arm
well
i
off
said
purdy
and
as
mahony
still
continued
to
quiz
him
he
added
in
a
downright
surly
tone
just
the
same
old
dick
as
ever
blinder
than
any
bat
to
all
that
does
concern
yourself
i
eat
my
hat
if
it
ever
entered
your
noddle
that
polly
quite
the
prettiest
woman
on
ballarat
do
listen
to
him
richard
please
and
do
let
your
head
be
turned
by
such
fulsome
flattery
my
dear
were
wife
and
simultaneous
exclamations
i
should
think
so
said
mary
sturdily
and
would
have
added
more
but
just
at
this
minute
jinny
came
out
of
the
house
with
the
peculiar
noiseless
tread
she
had
acquired
in
moving
round
an
infant
crib
and
purdy
vanished
jinny
gazed
at
her
with
such
meaning
that
mary
could
not
but
respond
did
you
get
her
safely
laid
down
dear
perfectly
mary
without
even
the
quiver
of
an
eyelash
you
recollect
i
told
you
yesterday
when
her
little
head
touched
the
pillow
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
me
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort
it
was
quite
perfect
and
jinny
voice
thrilled
at
the
remembrance
it
was
as
if
in
continuing
to
sleep
during
the
transit
her
or
rather
john
tiny
daughter
had
proved
herself
a
marvellous
sagacity
mahony
gave
an
impatient
shrug
in
jinny
direction
but
he
too
had
to
stand
fire
she
had
been
waiting
all
day
for
a
word
with
him
the
babe
who
was
teething
was
plagued
by
various
disorders
and
jinny
knew
each
fresh
of
a
spot
that
joined
the
rash
mahony
made
light
of
her
fears
then
turning
to
his
wife
asked
her
to
hurry
on
the
dinner
he
had
to
see
a
patient
between
that
meal
and
tea
mary
went
to
make
arrangements
richard
always
forgot
to
mention
such
things
till
the
last
moment
and
also
to
please
jinny
by
paying
a
visit
to
the
baby
the
angels
ca
look
very
different
when
they
sleep
i
think
murmured
its
mother
hanging
over
the
couch
when
mary
returned
she
found
her
husband
picking
caterpillars
off
the
vine
long
jim
odd
man
now
about
house
and
garden
was
not
industrious
enough
to
keep
the
pests
under
in
this
brief
spell
of
leisure
such
moments
grew
ever
rarer
in
richard
life
husband
and
wife
locked
their
arms
and
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
verandah
it
was
late
afternoon
on
a
breathless
february
day
and
the
boards
of
the
flooring
gritted
with
sandy
dust
beneath
their
feet
he
was
grumpy
this
afternoon
was
he
said
mary
without
preamble
but
i
noticed
once
or
twice
lately
that
he
ca
take
a
joke
any
more
he
grown
queer
altogether
do
you
know
he
the
only
person
who
still
persists
in
calling
me
by
my
old
name
he
was
quite
rude
about
it
when
i
asked
him
why
perhaps
he
liverish
from
the
heat
it
might
be
a
good
thing
dear
if
you
went
round
and
overhauled
him
somehow
it
seems
unnatural
for
purdy
to
be
it
true
he
may
be
a
bit
out
of
sorts
but
i
fear
the
it
my
opinion
the
boy
is
tiring
of
regular
work
now
that
he
has
even
the
excitement
of
the
to
look
forward
to
and
he
been
a
rolling
stone
from
the
beginning
you
know
if
only
he
would
marry
and
settle
down
i
do
wish
i
could
find
a
wife
for
him
the
right
woman
could
make
anything
of
purdy
and
yet
once
more
mary
fruitlessly
scanned
in
thought
the
lists
of
her
acquaintance
what
if
it
a
case
of
sour
grapes
love
since
the
prettiest
woman
on
ballarat
is
no
longer
free
oh
richard
hush
such
foolish
talk
but
is
it
let
me
look
at
her
well
if
not
the
prettiest
at
least
a
very
pretty
person
indeed
it
certainly
becomes
you
to
be
stouter
wife
but
mary
had
not
an
atom
of
vanity
in
her
speaking
of
prettiness
reminds
me
of
something
that
happened
at
the
races
last
week
i
forgot
to
tell
you
at
the
time
there
were
two
gentlemen
there
from
melbourne
and
as
agnes
ocock
went
past
one
of
them
said
out
loud
that
a
lovely
woman
agnes
heard
it
herself
and
was
most
distressed
and
the
whole
day
wherever
she
went
they
kept
their
on
her
henry
was
furious
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
my
dear
henry
can
not
hold
a
candle
to
some
one
i
know
to
my
mind
at
least
if
i
suit
you
richard
that
all
i
care
about
well
to
come
back
to
what
we
were
saying
my
advice
is
give
master
purdy
a
taste
of
the
cold
shoulder
the
next
time
he
comes
hanging
about
the
house
let
him
see
his
did
pass
unnoticed
there
no
excuse
for
it
god
bless
me
does
he
sleep
the
whole
night
through
in
his
bed
and
mahony
tone
took
on
an
edge
the
broken
nights
that
were
nowadays
the
rule
with
himself
were
the
main
drawbacks
to
his
prosperity
he
had
never
been
a
really
good
sleeper
and
in
consequence
was
one
of
those
people
who
feel
an
intense
need
for
sleep
and
suffer
under
its
curtailment
as
things
stood
at
present
his
rest
was
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
the
a
remorseless
instrument
given
chiefly
to
pealing
just
as
he
had
managed
to
drop
off
its
gentlest
tinkle
was
enough
to
rouse
him
long
before
it
had
succeeded
in
penetrating
the
ears
of
the
groom
who
was
supposed
to
open
and
when
it
remained
silent
for
a
night
some
trifling
noise
in
the
road
would
simulate
its
jangle
in
his
dreams
it
a
wonder
i
have
any
nerves
left
he
grumbled
as
the
hot
red
dawns
crept
in
at
the
sides
of
the
for
the
shortening
of
his
sleep
at
one
end
did
not
mean
that
he
could
make
it
up
at
the
other
all
that
summer
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
waking
at
five
and
not
being
able
to
doze
off
again
the
narrowest
bar
of
light
on
the
ceiling
the
earliest
twitter
of
the
sparrows
was
enough
to
strike
him
into
full
consciousness
and
mary
was
hard
put
to
it
to
darken
the
room
and
ensure
silence
and
would
be
till
the
day
came
when
he
could
knock
off
work
and
take
a
thorough
holiday
this
he
promised
himself
to
do
before
he
was
very
much
older
chapter
ii
mary
sat
with
pencil
and
paper
and
wrinkled
her
brows
she
was
composing
a
list
and
every
now
and
then
after
an
inward
calculation
she
lowered
the
pencil
to
note
such
items
as
three
four
trifles
eight
john
turnham
had
run
up
from
melbourne
to
fetch
home
wife
and
child
and
his
relatives
were
giving
a
musical
in
his
honour
by
the
window
jinny
sat
on
a
low
ottoman
suckling
her
babe
and
paying
but
scant
heed
to
her
deliberations
to
her
it
seemed
a
much
more
important
matter
that
the
milk
should
flow
smoothly
down
the
precious
little
throat
than
that
mary
supper
should
be
a
complete
success
with
her
free
hand
she
imprisoned
the
two
little
feet
working
one
against
the
other
in
slow
enjoyment
or
followed
the
warm
little
limbs
up
inside
the
swaddling
after
the
fashion
of
nursing
mothers
the
two
women
were
in
the
spare
bedroom
which
was
dusk
and
cool
and
and
they
exchanged
remarks
in
a
whisper
for
the
lids
had
come
down
more
than
once
on
the
big
black
eyes
and
now
only
lifted
automatically
from
time
to
time
to
send
a
last
look
of
utter
satiation
at
the
mary
always
said
she
drop
off
sooner
indoors
dear
but
this
was
not
the
whole
truth
richard
had
hinted
that
he
considered
the
seclusion
of
the
house
better
suited
to
the
business
of
nursing
than
the
comparative
publicity
of
the
verandah
for
jinny
was
too
absorbed
in
her
task
to
take
thought
for
the
proprieties
here
now
she
sat
she
had
grown
very
big
and
full
since
her
marriage
in
the
generous
pose
of
some
old
madonna
mary
thrown
entirely
on
her
own
judgment
was
just
saying
with
decision
well
better
to
err
on
the
right
side
and
have
too
much
than
too
little
and
altering
a
four
into
a
five
when
steps
came
down
the
passage
and
john
entered
the
room
jinny
made
him
a
sign
and
john
now
commissioner
of
trade
and
customs
advanced
as
lightly
as
could
be
expected
of
a
heavy
man
does
she
sleep
he
asked
his
eyes
had
flown
to
the
child
only
in
the
second
place
did
they
rest
on
his
wife
at
the
sight
of
her
free
and
easy
bearing
his
face
changed
and
he
said
stiffly
i
think
jane
a
little
less
exposure
of
your
person
my
dear
flushing
to
her
jinny
began
as
hastily
as
she
dared
to
her
dress
mary
broke
a
lance
on
her
behalf
we
were
quite
alone
john
she
reminded
her
brother
not
expecting
a
visit
from
you
and
added
richard
says
it
is
high
time
baby
was
weaned
jinny
is
feeling
the
strain
as
long
as
this
rash
continues
i
shall
not
permit
it
answered
john
riding
over
even
richard
opinion
i
should
agree
to
it
either
john
dear
murmured
jinny
and
now
mary
a
word
with
you
about
the
elder
children
i
understand
that
you
are
prepared
to
take
emma
back
is
that
so
yes
mary
was
pleased
to
say
richard
had
consented
to
trotty
return
but
he
would
not
hear
of
her
undertaking
johnny
at
eleven
years
of
age
the
proper
place
for
a
boy
he
said
was
a
grammar
school
with
trotty
of
course
it
was
different
i
always
found
her
easy
to
manage
and
should
be
more
than
glad
to
have
her
and
mary
meant
what
she
said
her
heart
ached
for
john
motherless
children
jinny
interest
in
them
had
lasted
only
so
long
as
she
had
none
of
her
own
and
mary
who
being
childless
had
kept
a
large
heart
for
all
little
ones
marvelled
at
the
firm
determination
to
get
rid
of
her
stepchildren
which
her
otherwise
so
pliable
displayed
brother
and
sister
talked
things
over
intuitively
meeting
understanding
each
other
with
a
word
as
only
blood
relations
can
jinny
the
chief
person
concerned
sat
meekly
by
or
chimed
in
merely
to
echo
her
husband
views
by
the
way
i
ran
into
richard
on
specimen
hill
said
john
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
and
he
asked
me
to
let
you
know
that
he
would
not
be
home
to
lunch
there
if
that
is
always
the
way
exclaimed
mary
as
sure
as
i
cook
something
he
specially
likes
he
does
come
in
tilly
sent
me
over
the
loveliest
little
this
morning
richard
would
have
enjoyed
it
you
should
be
proud
my
dear
mary
that
his
services
are
in
such
demand
i
am
john
no
one
could
be
prouder
but
all
the
same
i
wish
he
could
manage
to
be
a
little
more
regular
with
his
meals
it
makes
cooking
so
difficult
because
i
sha
have
a
minute
to
spare
he
be
home
punctually
demanding
something
nice
but
i
warn
you
you
all
have
to
picnic
however
when
the
day
came
she
was
better
than
her
word
and
looked
to
it
that
neither
guests
nor
husband
went
short
since
a
couple
of
tables
on
trestles
took
up
the
john
and
mahony
lunched
together
in
the
surgery
while
jinny
meal
was
spread
on
a
tray
and
sent
to
her
in
the
bedroom
mary
herself
had
time
only
to
snatch
a
bite
standing
from
early
morning
on
tied
up
in
a
voluminous
apron
she
was
cooking
in
the
kitchen
very
hot
and
floury
and
preoccupied
drawing
grating
shelves
out
of
the
oven
greasing
tins
and
dredging
flour
the
of
resounded
continuously
and
mountains
of
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
rose
under
her
hands
this
would
be
the
largest
most
ambitious
party
she
had
ever
given
the
guests
expected
numbered
between
twenty
and
thirty
and
had
besides
carte
blanche
to
bring
with
them
anyone
who
happened
to
be
staying
with
them
and
it
would
be
a
disgrace
under
which
mary
reared
in
beamish
school
could
never
again
have
held
up
her
head
had
a
single
article
on
her
run
short
in
all
this
she
had
only
such
help
as
her
one
maidservant
could
give
her
john
had
expressly
forbidden
jinny
the
kitchen
true
during
the
morning
miss
amelia
ocock
a
gentle
little
elderly
body
with
a
harmless
smile
and
a
prominent
jaw
who
was
now
an
inmate
of
her
father
house
together
with
zara
returned
from
england
and
a
visitor
at
the
ocock
these
two
walked
over
to
offer
their
aid
in
setting
the
tables
but
miss
amelia
fluttery
and
undecided
as
a
bird
was
far
too
timid
to
do
herself
justice
and
zara
spent
so
long
arranging
the
flowers
in
the
central
epergnes
that
before
she
had
finished
with
one
of
them
it
was
lunch
time
i
could
have
done
it
myself
while
she
was
cutting
the
stalks
mary
told
her
husband
but
zara
has
really
been
any
good
at
flowers
since
her
bouquet
took
first
prize
at
the
flower
show
of
course
though
it
looks
lovely
now
it
done
purdy
dropped
in
during
the
afternoon
and
was
more
useful
he
sliced
the
crusts
off
mounds
of
sandwiches
and
tested
the
strength
and
flavour
of
the
mary
could
not
make
up
her
mind
when
it
came
to
the
point
to
follow
richard
advice
and
treat
him
coldly
she
did
however
tell
him
that
his
help
would
be
worth
a
great
deal
more
to
her
if
he
talked
less
and
did
not
always
look
for
an
answer
to
what
he
said
but
purdy
was
not
to
be
quashed
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
that
she
was
badly
treated
in
being
left
to
slave
alone
within
the
oven
radius
and
he
was
very
hard
on
jinny
whom
he
had
espied
comfortably
dandling
her
child
on
the
front
verandah
i
like
to
wring
the
bloomin
kid
neck
purdy
for
shame
cried
mary
outraged
it
easy
to
see
you
still
a
bachelor
just
wait
sir
till
you
have
children
of
your
own
under
her
guidance
he
bore
stacks
of
plates
across
the
yard
to
the
where
the
blinds
were
lowered
to
keep
the
room
cool
and
strewed
these
and
corresponding
knives
and
forks
up
and
down
the
tables
he
also
carried
over
the
heavy
in
which
was
the
but
he
had
a
man
slippery
fingers
and
between
these
and
his
limp
mary
trembled
for
the
fate
of
her
crockery
he
made
her
laugh
too
and
distracted
her
attention
and
she
was
glad
when
it
was
time
for
him
to
return
to
barracks
now
come
early
she
admonished
him
and
mind
you
bring
your
music
miss
amelia
been
practising
up
that
duet
all
the
week
be
most
disappointed
if
you
do
ask
her
to
sing
with
you
on
the
threshold
of
the
kitchen
purdy
set
his
fingers
to
his
nose
in
the
probable
direction
of
miss
amelia
then
performed
some
skittish
female
twists
and
turns
about
the
yard
so
hoarse
love
a
bad
cold
not
in
voice
mary
laughed
afresh
and
ordered
him
off
but
when
he
had
gone
she
looked
grave
and
out
of
an
oddly
disquieting
feeling
said
to
herself
i
do
hope
he
be
on
his
best
behaviour
and
not
tread
on
richard
toes
as
it
was
she
had
to
inform
her
husband
of
something
that
she
knew
would
displease
him
john
had
come
back
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
announced
without
ceremony
that
he
had
extended
an
invitation
to
the
devines
for
the
evening
it
quite
true
what
being
said
dear
mary
strove
to
soothe
richard
as
she
helped
him
make
a
hasty
toilet
in
the
bathroom
devine
is
going
to
stand
for
parliament
and
he
has
promised
his
support
if
he
gets
in
to
some
measure
john
has
at
heart
john
wants
to
have
a
long
talk
with
him
but
richard
was
exceedingly
put
out
well
i
hope
my
dear
that
as
it
your
brother
who
has
taken
such
a
liberty
you
explain
the
situation
to
your
guests
i
certainly
shall
not
but
i
do
know
there
was
no
need
to
exclude
ned
and
polly
from
such
an
as
this
party
of
yours
will
be
even
while
he
spoke
there
came
a
at
the
front
door
and
mary
had
to
hurry
off
and
now
knock
succeeded
knock
with
the
briefest
of
intervals
the
noise
carrying
far
in
the
quiet
street
mysteriously
figures
their
heads
veiled
in
the
fleeciest
of
clouds
were
piloted
along
the
passage
and
i
hope
we
are
not
the
first
was
murmured
by
each
in
turn
the
gentlemen
went
to
change
their
boots
on
the
back
verandah
the
ladies
to
lay
off
their
wraps
in
bedroom
and
soon
this
room
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
the
large
soft
abundance
of
crinoline
hoops
swaying
from
this
side
to
that
as
the
guests
gave
place
to
one
another
before
the
where
bands
of
hair
were
smoothed
and
the
catches
of
bracelets
snapped
lay
strewn
over
the
counterpane
the
husbands
who
lined
up
in
the
passage
to
wait
for
their
wives
also
bearing
rolls
of
music
mary
in
black
silk
with
a
large
cameo
brooch
at
her
throat
and
only
a
delicate
pink
on
her
cheeks
to
tell
of
all
her
labours
moved
helpfully
to
and
fro
offering
a
a
pins
and
hairpins
she
was
caught
as
she
passed
henry
ocock
a
modishly
late
arrival
by
that
lady
plump
white
hand
and
a
whispered
request
to
be
allowed
to
retain
her
mantle
henry
was
really
against
my
coming
dearest
so
anxious
so
absurdly
anxious
and
pray
where
the
honourable
t
inquired
old
ocock
rustling
up
to
them
tilly
was
the
biggest
and
most
handsomely
dressed
woman
in
the
room
on
her
knees
worshipping
i
bet
you
up
to
the
last
minute
or
else
not
allowed
to
show
her
nose
till
the
honourable
john
got
his
studs
now
then
girls
how
much
longer
are
you
going
to
stand
preening
and
prinking
the
girls
were
zara
at
this
present
a
trifle
passee
and
miss
amelia
who
was
still
further
from
her
prime
and
gathering
the
two
into
her
train
as
a
hen
does
its
chickens
tilly
swept
them
off
to
face
the
ordeal
of
the
gentlemen
and
the
mary
and
agnes
brought
up
the
rear
henry
was
on
the
watch
and
directly
his
wife
appeared
wheeled
forward
the
best
armchair
and
placed
her
in
it
with
a
footstool
under
her
feet
mary
planted
jinny
next
her
and
left
them
to
their
talk
of
nurseries
for
richard
sake
she
wished
to
screen
agnes
from
the
vulgarities
of
devine
herself
she
saw
with
dismay
on
entering
that
richard
had
already
been
pounced
on
by
the
husband
there
he
stood
listening
to
his
words
they
were
interlarded
with
many
an
awkward
and
familiar
gesture
on
his
face
an
expression
his
wife
knew
well
while
one
small
impatient
hand
tugged
at
his
whiskers
but
old
ocock
came
to
his
rescue
bearing
down
upon
him
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
a
that
could
be
heard
all
over
the
room
tilly
had
long
forgotten
that
she
had
ever
borne
him
a
grudge
she
it
was
who
could
now
afford
to
patronise
i
hope
i
see
you
well
doctor
oh
not
a
bit
of
it
i
left
him
at
has
something
wrong
if
you
please
with
his
leg
or
his
big
toe
gout
or
rheumatiz
or
something
of
that
sort
and
been
so
crabby
with
it
for
the
last
day
or
so
that
i
said
to
my
dear
you
just
take
a
glass
of
hot
toddy
and
go
early
and
comfortable
to
your
bed
musical
parties
are
in
his
line
anyhow
a
lively
clatter
of
tongues
filled
the
room
the
space
of
which
was
taxed
to
its
utmost
there
were
present
besides
the
friends
and
intimates
of
the
house
several
of
mahony
colleagues
a
couple
of
bank
managers
the
police
magistrate
the
postmaster
the
town
clerk
all
with
their
ladies
before
long
however
ominous
pauses
began
to
break
up
the
conversation
and
mary
was
accomplished
hostess
enough
to
know
what
these
meant
at
a
sign
from
her
jerry
lighted
the
candles
on
the
piano
and
thereupon
a
chorus
went
up
mahony
wo
you
play
something
oh
do
yes
please
do
i
should
enjoy
it
so
much
mary
did
not
wait
to
be
pressed
it
was
her
business
to
set
the
ball
rolling
and
she
stood
up
and
went
to
the
piano
as
unconcernedly
as
she
would
have
gone
to
sweep
a
room
or
make
a
bed
placing
a
piece
of
music
on
the
rack
she
turned
down
the
corners
of
the
leaves
but
here
archdeacon
long
handsome
weatherbeaten
face
looked
over
her
shoulder
i
hope
you
going
to
give
us
the
cannons
mrs
mahony
he
said
genially
and
so
mary
obliged
him
by
laying
aside
the
morceau
she
had
chosen
and
setting
up
instead
a
that
was
a
general
favourite
aha
that
the
ticket
said
henry
ocock
and
rubbed
his
hands
as
mary
struck
up
pianissimo
the
march
that
told
of
the
enemy
approach
and
archdeacon
long
could
not
refrain
from
underlining
each
fresh
salvo
of
artillery
while
that
a
breach
in
their
walls
for
was
chinnery
of
the
london
contribution
to
the
stock
of
fun
mahony
stood
on
the
hearthrug
and
surveyed
the
assembly
his
eyes
fled
devine
most
unfortunately
perched
on
an
ottoman
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
she
sat
purple
shiny
and
beaming
two
hot
fat
red
hands
clasped
over
her
stomach
like
a
heathen
idol
confound
the
woman
i
shall
have
to
go
and
do
the
polite
to
her
and
sought
mary
at
the
piano
hanging
with
pleasure
on
the
slim
form
in
the
rich
silk
dress
this
caught
numberless
lights
from
the
candles
as
did
also
the
wings
of
her
glossy
hair
he
watched
with
a
kind
of
amused
tenderness
how
at
each
forte
passage
head
and
shoulders
took
their
share
of
lending
force
to
the
tones
he
never
greatly
enjoyed
mary
playing
she
did
well
enough
at
it
god
bless
her
it
would
not
have
been
mary
if
she
had
but
he
came
of
a
musical
family
his
mother
had
sung
handel
faultlessly
in
her
day
besides
having
a
mastery
of
several
instruments
and
he
was
apt
to
be
critical
mary
firm
capable
hands
looked
out
of
place
on
a
piano
seemed
to
stand
in
a
sheerly
business
relation
to
the
keys
nor
was
it
otherwise
with
her
singing
she
had
a
fair
contralto
but
her
ear
was
at
fault
and
he
sometimes
found
himself
swallowing
nervously
when
she
attacked
high
notes
oh
doctor
your
wife
do
play
the
pianner
lovely
said
devine
and
her
fat
front
rose
and
fell
in
an
ecstatic
sigh
richard
dear
will
you
come
mary
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulder
their
guests
were
clamouring
for
a
duo
her
touch
was
a
caress
here
he
was
making
himself
as
pleasant
as
he
knew
how
to
this
old
woman
when
it
came
to
doing
a
kindness
you
could
rely
on
richard
he
was
all
bark
and
no
bite
husband
and
wife
blended
their
voices
mary
had
been
at
considerable
pains
to
get
up
her
part
and
then
richard
went
on
to
a
solo
he
had
a
clear
true
tenor
that
was
very
agreeable
to
hear
and
mary
felt
quite
proud
of
his
attainments
later
in
the
evening
he
might
be
persuaded
to
give
them
a
reading
from
boz
or
a
recitation
at
that
kind
of
thing
he
had
not
his
equal
but
first
there
was
a
cry
for
his
flute
and
in
vain
did
mahony
protest
that
weeks
had
elapsed
since
he
last
screwed
the
instrument
together
he
got
no
quarter
even
from
mary
but
then
mary
was
one
of
those
inconvenient
people
to
whom
it
mattered
not
a
jot
what
a
fool
you
made
of
yourself
as
long
as
you
did
what
was
asked
of
you
and
so
from
memory
and
unaccompanied
he
played
them
the
old
familiar
air
of
the
minstrel
boy
the
theme
in
his
rendering
was
overlaid
by
florid
variations
and
cumbered
with
senseless
repetitions
but
none
the
less
the
wild
wistful
melody
went
home
touching
even
those
who
were
not
musical
to
thoughtfulness
and
retrospect
the
most
obstinate
chatterers
whom
neither
sham
battles
nor
balfe
and
blockley
had
silenced
held
their
tongues
and
devine
openly
wiped
her
eyes
o
the
minstrel
boy
to
the
wars
has
gone
in
the
ranks
of
death
you
find
him
while
it
was
proceeding
mary
found
herself
seated
next
john
john
tapped
his
foot
in
time
to
the
tune
and
under
cover
of
the
applause
at
its
close
remarked
abruptly
you
should
fatten
richard
up
a
bit
mary
he
could
stand
it
from
where
they
sat
they
had
richard
in
profile
and
mary
studied
her
husband
critically
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
yes
he
is
rather
thin
but
i
do
think
he
was
ever
meant
to
be
fat
ah
well
we
are
none
of
us
as
young
as
we
used
to
be
was
tribute
to
the
power
of
music
and
throwing
out
his
stomach
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
plugged
the
armholes
of
his
vest
with
his
thumbs
and
now
after
due
pressing
on
the
part
of
host
and
hostess
the
other
members
of
the
company
advanced
upon
the
piano
either
singly
or
in
couples
to
bear
a
hand
in
the
burden
of
entertainment
their
seeming
reluctance
had
no
basis
in
fact
for
it
was
an
unwritten
law
that
every
one
who
could
must
add
his
mite
and
only
those
who
literally
had
not
a
note
of
music
in
them
were
exempt
tilly
took
a
mischievous
pleasure
in
announcing
bluntly
so
sorry
my
dear
not
to
be
able
to
do
you
a
but
when
the
honourable
and
i
were
nippers
no
time
to
loll
round
pianos
nor
any
pianos
to
loll
round
this
just
to
see
her
dark
scowl
for
no
love
not
even
a
liking
was
lost
between
her
and
john
but
with
this
handful
of
exceptions
all
nobly
toed
the
line
ladies
with
the
tiniest
reeds
of
voices
which
shook
like
reeds
warbled
of
last
roses
and
prairie
flowers
others
with
more
force
but
due
decorum
cried
to
willie
that
they
had
missed
him
or
coyly
confessed
to
the
presence
of
silver
threads
among
the
gold
and
chinnery
an
woman
with
a
long
lean
neck
which
she
twisted
this
way
and
that
in
the
exertion
of
producing
her
notes
declared
her
love
for
an
old
armchair
the
gentlemen
in
baritones
and
profundos
told
the
amorous
adventures
of
ben
bolt
or
desired
to
know
what
home
would
be
without
a
mother
purdy
spiced
the
hour
with
a
comic
song
and
in
the
character
of
an
outraged
wife
tickled
the
risibility
of
the
ladies
well
well
sir
so
you
come
at
last
i
thought
you
come
no
more
i
waited
with
my
bonnet
on
from
one
till
four
zara
and
long
both
produced
home
they
brought
her
warrior
dead
from
their
portfolios
so
zara
gave
way
and
struck
up
robert
toi
que
which
she
had
added
to
her
repertory
while
in
england
no
one
could
understand
a
word
of
what
she
sang
but
the
mere
fitting
of
the
foreign
syllables
to
the
appropriate
notes
was
considered
a
feat
in
itself
and
corroborative
of
the
high
gifts
zara
possessed
strenuous
efforts
were
needed
to
get
miss
amelia
to
her
feet
she
was
dying
as
mary
knew
to
perform
her
duet
with
purdy
but
when
the
moment
came
she
put
forward
so
many
reasons
for
not
complying
that
most
people
retired
in
despair
it
took
mary
to
persevere
and
finally
the
little
woman
was
persuaded
to
the
piano
where
red
with
gratification
she
sat
down
spread
her
skirts
and
unclasped
her
bracelets
poor
little
amelia
said
mary
to
herself
as
she
listened
to
a
romantic
ballad
in
which
purdy
in
the
character
of
a
nobleman
sought
the
hand
of
a
virtuous
and
he
give
her
a
second
thought
if
one
could
just
tell
her
not
to
be
so
silly
not
only
had
purdy
never
once
looked
near
amelia
for
the
most
part
he
had
sat
rather
in
and
out
of
a
french
window
even
zara
attempts
to
enliven
him
falling
flat
but
during
an
extra
loud
performance
tilly
had
confided
to
mary
the
family
plans
for
their
spinster
relative
and
the
poor
little
woman
thought
mary
again
as
she
listened
for
after
having
been
tied
for
years
to
the
sick
bed
of
a
querulous
mother
after
braving
the
long
which
for
such
a
timid
soul
was
full
of
ambushes
and
terrors
miss
amelia
had
reached
her
journey
end
only
to
find
both
father
and
brother
comfortably
wived
and
with
no
use
for
her
neither
of
them
wanted
her
she
had
been
given
first
by
her
father
then
by
the
henrys
and
once
more
had
had
to
go
back
to
the
paternal
roof
it
was
nothing
for
mossieu
henry
in
the
long
run
was
his
stepmother
comment
but
she
laughed
as
she
said
it
for
his
first
wrath
at
her
intrusion
over
henry
had
more
or
less
become
her
friend
and
now
maintained
that
it
was
not
a
bad
thing
for
his
old
father
to
have
a
sensible
managing
woman
behind
him
tilly
had
developed
in
many
ways
since
her
marriage
and
henry
and
she
mutually
respected
each
other
practical
qualities
the
upshot
of
the
affair
was
she
now
told
mary
that
miss
male
relatives
had
subscribed
a
dowry
for
her
it
was
me
that
insisted
henry
should
pay
his
share
him
getting
all
the
money
did
with
agnes
and
amelia
was
to
be
married
off
to
well
if
you
turn
your
head
my
dear
you
see
who
back
there
helping
to
hold
up
the
doorpost
under
cover
of
zara
roulades
mary
cautiously
looked
round
it
was
henry
partner
young
grindle
now
on
the
threshold
of
the
thirties
his
a
shade
less
flamboyant
than
of
old
a
heavy
draped
across
his
front
grindle
stood
and
lounged
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
mary
made
round
eyes
oh
but
tilly
is
it
very
risky
he
so
much
younger
than
she
is
suppose
she
should
be
happy
that
be
all
right
mary
trust
me
only
give
a
handle
to
name
and
amelia
be
happy
with
any
one
she
has
that
much
backbone
in
besides
my
dear
you
think
she
over
forty
let
her
take
chance
and
be
thankful
it
is
every
old
maid
get
such
an
offer
and
is
is
he
agreeable
asked
mary
still
unconvinced
tilly
half
closed
her
right
eye
and
protruded
the
tip
of
her
tongue
you
could
stake
your
last
fiver
on
it
he
is
but
now
that
portion
of
the
entertainment
devoted
to
art
was
at
an
end
and
the
serious
business
of
the
evening
began
had
been
set
out
for
loo
as
for
less
hazardous
games
in
principle
mahony
objected
to
the
high
play
that
was
the
order
of
the
day
but
if
you
invited
people
to
your
house
you
could
not
ask
them
to
screw
their
points
down
from
crowns
to
halfpence
they
would
have
thanked
you
kindly
and
have
stayed
at
home
here
at
the
places
were
eagerly
snapped
up
henry
ocock
and
his
stepmother
being
among
the
first
to
secure
seats
both
were
keen
hard
players
who
invariably
their
pockets
it
would
not
have
been
the
thing
for
either
mahony
or
his
wife
to
take
a
hand
several
of
the
guests
held
aloof
john
had
buttonholed
old
devine
jinny
and
agnes
were
still
lost
in
domesticities
dear
little
agnes
had
grown
so
retiring
of
late
thought
mary
she
quite
avoided
the
society
of
gentlemen
in
which
she
had
formerly
taken
such
pleasure
richard
and
archdeacon
long
sat
on
the
verandah
and
in
moving
to
and
fro
mary
caught
a
fragment
of
their
talk
they
were
at
the
debatable
question
of
and
her
mental
comment
was
a
motherly
and
amused
that
richard
who
is
so
clever
can
interest
himself
in
such
nonsense
further
on
zara
was
giving
grindle
an
account
of
her
voyage
home
and
ticking
off
the
reasons
that
had
led
to
her
return
she
sat
across
a
hammock
and
daintily
exposed
a
very
neat
ankle
it
was
much
too
sleepy
and
dull
for
me
no
i
quite
decided
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
days
in
the
colony
devine
was
still
perched
on
her
ottoman
she
beamed
at
her
hostess
no
i
dunno
one
card
from
another
dearie
and
don
want
to
oh
my
dear
what
a
lovely
party
it
been
and
well
carried
it
mary
nodded
and
smiled
but
with
an
air
of
abstraction
the
climax
of
her
evening
was
fast
approaching
excusing
herself
she
slipped
away
and
went
to
cast
a
last
eye
over
her
up
and
down
which
benches
were
ranged
borrowed
from
the
sunday
school
to
her
surprise
she
found
herself
followed
by
devine
do
let
me
you
my
dear
do
now
i
feel
that
stiff
and
silly
sittin
stuck
up
there
with
me
before
me
and
jes
send
that
young
feller
about
business
so
purdy
and
his
offers
of
assistance
were
returned
with
thanks
to
the
and
devine
pinned
up
her
black
silk
front
but
not
till
she
had
freely
vented
her
astonishment
at
the
profusion
of
mary
good
things
do
you
git
to
rise
so
no
i
never
did
fit
for
palace
and
queen
victoria
and
all
by
your
little
self
my
dear
i
must
give
you
a
good
hence
when
at
twelve
the
company
began
to
stream
in
they
found
devine
installed
behind
the
barricade
of
cups
saucers
and
glasses
and
she
it
was
who
dispensed
tea
and
coffee
and
ladled
out
the
thus
leaving
mary
free
to
keep
an
argus
eye
on
her
visitors
plates
at
his
entry
richard
had
raised
expostulating
eyebrows
but
his
tongue
of
course
was
tied
and
mary
made
a
lifelong
friend
and
now
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
mary
sandwiches
and
her
pastries
and
her
jellies
custards
and
creams
her
blanc
and
jaunemanges
and
whipped
syllabubs
her
trifles
and
formed
the
theme
of
talk
and
objects
of
attention
and
though
the
ladies
picked
with
becoming
daintiness
the
gentlemen
made
up
for
their
partners
deficiencies
and
there
was
none
present
who
did
not
in
the
shape
of
a
hearty
and
compliment
add
yet
another
laurel
to
mary
crown
chapter
iii
it
had
struck
two
before
the
party
began
to
break
up
the
first
move
made
however
the
guests
left
in
batches
escorting
one
another
to
their
respective
the
henry
ococks
buggy
had
been
in
waiting
for
some
time
and
henry
pretty
head
was
drooping
with
fatigue
before
henry
who
was
in
the
vein
could
tear
himself
from
the
mahony
went
to
the
front
gate
with
them
then
strolled
with
the
longs
to
the
corner
of
the
road
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
retrace
his
steps
the
air
was
balmy
after
that
of
the
overcrowded
rooms
and
it
was
a
fabulously
beautiful
night
the
earth
lay
steeped
in
moonshine
as
in
the
light
of
a
silver
sun
trees
and
shrubs
were
patterned
to
their
last
leaf
on
the
ground
before
them
what
odd
mental
twist
made
mortals
choose
rather
to
huddle
indoors
by
puny
than
to
be
abroad
laving
themselves
in
a
splendour
such
as
this
leaning
his
arms
on
the
top
rail
of
a
fence
he
looked
across
the
slope
at
the
flat
now
hushed
and
still
as
the
encampment
of
a
sleeping
army
beyond
the
bush
shimmered
palely
grey
in
his
younger
years
he
had
been
used
on
a
night
like
this
when
the
moon
sailed
full
and
free
to
take
his
gun
and
go
opossuming
those
two
old
woody
gods
warrenheip
and
buninyong
stood
out
more
imposingly
than
by
day
but
the
ranges
seemed
to
have
retreated
the
light
lay
upon
them
like
a
visible
burden
flattening
their
contours
filling
up
clefts
and
fissures
with
a
milky
haze
good
evening
doctor
spoken
in
his
very
ear
the
words
made
him
jump
he
had
been
lost
in
contemplation
and
the
address
had
a
ghostly
suddenness
but
it
was
no
ghost
that
stood
beside
him
nor
indeed
was
it
a
night
for
those
presences
to
be
abroad
whose
element
is
the
dark
at
the
intrusion
he
returned
but
a
stiff
nod
then
since
he
could
not
in
decency
greet
and
in
a
breath
feigned
to
go
on
for
a
minute
with
his
study
of
the
landscape
after
which
he
said
well
i
must
be
moving
good
night
to
you
so
you
off
your
sleep
too
are
you
as
often
happens
the
impulse
to
speak
was
a
joint
one
the
words
collided
instinctively
mahony
shrank
into
himself
this
familiar
bracketing
of
his
person
with
another
was
distasteful
to
him
besides
the
man
who
had
sprung
up
at
his
elbow
bore
a
reputation
that
was
none
of
the
best
the
owner
of
a
small
chemist
shop
on
the
flat
he
contrived
to
give
offence
in
sundry
ways
he
was
irreligious
an
infidel
his
neighbours
had
it
and
of
a
sabbath
would
scour
his
premises
or
hoe
potatoes
rather
than
attend
church
or
chapel
though
not
a
confirmed
drunkard
he
had
been
seen
to
stagger
in
the
street
and
be
unable
to
answer
when
spoken
to
also
the
woman
with
whom
he
lived
was
not
generally
believed
to
be
his
lawful
wife
hence
the
public
fought
shy
of
his
nostrums
and
it
was
a
standing
riddle
how
he
managed
to
avoid
putting
up
his
shutters
more
nefarious
practices
no
doubt
said
the
relentless
vox
seen
near
at
hand
he
was
a
tall
fellow
of
some
forty
years
of
age
the
muscles
on
his
neck
standing
out
like
those
of
a
skinny
old
horse
here
his
gratuitous
assumption
of
a
common
bond
drew
a
cold
pray
what
reason
have
you
to
think
that
from
mahony
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
again
said
good
night
and
turned
to
go
the
man
accepted
the
rebuff
with
a
meekness
that
was
painful
to
see
thought
comin
on
you
like
this
you
were
a
case
like
my
own
no
offence
i
sure
he
said
humbly
it
was
evident
he
was
well
used
to
getting
the
cold
shoulder
mahony
stayed
his
steps
what
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
are
you
well
there
a
remedy
to
be
found
for
most
ills
under
the
sun
not
for
mine
the
doctor
is
born
or
the
drug
discovered
that
could
cure
me
the
tone
of
bragging
bitterness
grated
anew
himself
given
to
the
vice
of
overstatement
mahony
had
small
mercy
on
it
in
others
tut
tut
he
deprecated
there
was
a
brief
silence
before
the
speaker
went
on
more
quietly
you
a
young
man
doctor
i
an
old
one
and
he
looked
old
as
he
spoke
mahony
saw
that
he
had
erred
in
putting
him
down
as
merely
elderly
he
was
old
and
grey
and
fifty
if
a
day
and
his
clothes
hung
loose
on
his
bony
frame
you
excuse
me
if
i
say
i
know
you
when
a
man
done
he
done
and
that
me
yes
he
grew
inflated
again
in
reciting
his
woes
i
one
o
your
hopeless
cases
just
as
surely
as
if
i
was
being
eaten
up
by
a
cancer
or
a
consumption
to
mend
me
you
doctors
need
to
start
me
afresh
from
the
you
exaggerate
i
sure
it
that
knowin
one
played
out
with
by
rights
still
a
good
third
of
one
life
to
run
that
what
puts
the
sleep
away
in
the
daylight
it
none
so
hard
to
keep
the
black
thoughts
under
themselves
not
so
daresome
and
there
one
pipe
and
the
haver
o
the
young
fry
but
night
the
time
then
they
come
tramplin
along
a
whole
army
of
carryin
banners
with
letters
a
dozen
feet
high
so
you
sha
miss
rememberin
what
you
give
your
soul
to
forget
and
so
it
go
on
et
cetera
and
ad
till
it
pleases
the
old
joker
who
sits
grinnin
up
aloft
to
put
his
heel
down
as
you
or
me
would
squash
a
or
a
scorpion
you
speak
bitterly
tangye
does
a
night
like
this
not
bring
you
calmer
clearer
thoughts
and
mahony
waved
his
arm
in
a
large
loose
gesture
at
the
sky
his
words
passed
unheeded
the
man
he
addressed
spun
round
and
faced
him
with
a
rusty
laugh
hark
at
that
he
cried
just
hark
at
it
why
in
all
the
years
i
been
in
this
place
long
as
i
been
here
i
never
yet
heard
my
own
name
properly
spoken
you
the
first
doctor
you
shall
have
the
medal
but
man
alive
you
surely
do
let
that
worry
you
why
i
the
same
thing
to
put
up
with
every
day
of
my
life
i
smile
at
it
and
mahony
believed
what
he
said
forgetting
in
the
antagonism
such
spleen
roused
in
him
the
annoyance
the
false
stressing
of
his
own
name
could
sometimes
cause
him
so
did
i
once
said
tangye
and
wagged
his
head
but
the
day
came
when
it
seemed
the
last
straw
a
bit
o
mean
spite
on
the
part
o
this
hell
of
a
country
itself
you
dislike
the
colony
it
appears
intensely
you
like
it
the
counter
question
came
tip
for
tap
i
can
be
fair
to
it
i
hope
and
appreciate
its
good
sides
as
always
the
mere
hint
of
an
injustice
made
mahony
passionately
just
came
of
your
own
free
will
did
you
were
crowded
out
at
home
or
bamboozled
by
a
pack
o
lying
tales
tangye
voice
was
husky
with
eagerness
that
i
wo
say
either
but
it
is
entirely
my
own
choice
that
i
remain
here
well
i
say
to
you
think
twice
of
it
if
you
have
the
chance
of
gettin
away
take
it
it
no
place
this
doctor
for
the
likes
of
you
and
me
have
you
never
turned
and
asked
yourself
what
the
devil
you
were
doin
here
and
that
reminds
me
there
was
a
line
we
used
to
have
drummed
into
us
at
school
it
often
come
back
to
me
since
coelum
non
animum
mutant
qui
trans
mare
currunt
in
our
green
days
we
gabbled
that
off
by
rote
then
it
seemed
just
one
more
o
the
phrases
the
classics
are
full
of
now
i
take
off
my
hat
to
the
man
who
wrote
it
he
knew
what
he
was
talkin
about
by
the
lord
harry
he
did
the
latin
had
come
out
tentatively
with
an
odd
unused
intonation
mahony
retort
how
on
earth
do
you
know
what
suits
me
and
what
does
died
on
his
lips
he
was
surprised
into
silence
there
had
been
nothing
in
the
other
speech
to
show
that
he
was
a
man
of
any
education
rather
the
reverse
meanwhile
tangye
went
on
i
grant
you
it
an
antiquated
point
view
but
does
that
go
to
prove
what
i
been
sayin
that
you
and
me
are
too
here
the
modern
sort
the
sort
that
gets
on
in
this
country
is
a
prime
hand
at
his
coat
to
suit
his
cloth
for
all
that
the
like
the
writer
o
that
line
and
other
ancients
prate
about
the
hide
or
the
leopard
and
his
spots
they
did
buy
their
experience
dear
like
we
did
did
guess
that
if
a
man
do
learn
to
fit
himself
in
when
he
gets
set
down
in
such
a
land
as
this
he
a
goner
any
they
knew
that
most
o
those
who
hold
out
here
all
of
at
any
rate
who
climbed
the
ladder
nabbed
the
plunder
have
found
no
more
difficulty
in
changin
their
spots
than
they
have
their
trousers
yes
doctor
there
only
one
breed
that
flourishes
and
you
do
need
me
to
tell
you
which
it
is
here
they
lie
and
he
nodded
to
right
and
left
of
him
dreamin
o
their
and
their
dividends
and
their
profits
and
how
they
diddle
and
swindle
one
another
afresh
soon
as
the
sun
gets
up
harder
nails
they
are
and
sharp
as
needles
you
ask
me
why
i
do
my
walkin
out
in
the
it
so
to
avoid
the
sight
o
their
mean
little
eyes
and
their
greedy
graspin
faces
mahony
murmured
disclaimer
fell
on
deaf
ears
like
one
who
had
been
bottled
up
for
months
tangye
flowed
on
what
a
life
what
a
set
what
a
place
to
end
one
days
in
remember
if
you
can
the
yarns
that
were
spun
round
it
for
our
benefit
from
twenty
thousand
safe
miles
away
it
was
the
land
o
promise
and
plenty
topful
o
gold
strewn
over
with
nuggets
that
only
waited
for
hands
to
pick
lies
lies
from
beginnin
to
end
i
say
to
you
this
is
the
hardest
and
cruellest
country
ever
created
and
a
man
like
me
no
more
good
here
than
the
muck
the
parin
and
stale
fishguts
and
other
leavin
that
knocks
about
a
harbour
and
washes
against
the
walls
i
tell
you
the
only
use
i
have
been
here
doctor
when
my
end
comes
i
dung
some
bit
o
land
for
with
my
moulder
and
rot
that
all
they
do
better
with
my
sort
if
they
knocked
us
on
the
head
betimes
and
boiled
us
down
for
our
fat
and
marrow
not
much
in
that
line
to
be
got
from
your
carcase
my
friend
thought
mahony
with
an
inward
smile
but
tangye
had
paused
merely
to
draw
breath
what
i
say
is
instead
layin
snares
for
us
it
ought
to
be
forbid
by
law
to
give
men
o
my
make
ship
room
at
home
in
the
old
country
we
find
our
little
nook
and
jog
along
decently
to
the
end
of
our
days
but
just
the
staid
respectable
orderly
sort
i
belonged
to
neither
needed
nor
wanted
here
i
fall
to
thinkin
sometimes
on
the
fates
of
the
hundreds
of
honest
lads
who
at
one
time
or
another
have
chucked
up
their
jobs
over
there
for
this
the
drink
no
doubt
took
most
they
never
knew
before
that
one
could
sweat
as
you
sweat
here
and
the
rest
well
just
accident
or
the
sun
or
dysentery
or
the
bloody
toil
that
goes
by
the
name
o
work
in
these
parts
you
know
the
list
doctor
me
they
say
the
waste
o
life
in
a
new
country
be
helped
does
matter
has
to
be
but
that
cold
comfort
to
the
wasted
no
i
say
to
you
there
ought
to
be
an
act
of
parliament
to
prevent
young
fellows
squanderin
themselves
throwin
away
their
lives
as
i
did
mine
for
when
we
young
we
not
sane
youth
a
fever
the
brain
and
i
was
young
once
though
you
might
believe
it
i
had
straight
joints
and
no
pouch
under
my
chin
and
my
full
share
o
windy
hopes
senseless
truck
these
to
be
spilled
overboard
bit
by
bit
like
on
a
tramp
a
finishes
by
pitchin
from
his
swag
all
the
needless
rubbish
he
started
with
what
wanted
to
get
on
here
somethin
quite
else
horny
palms
and
costive
bowels
a
dash
o
the
sharper
and
no
sickly
squeamishness
about
knockin
out
other
men
and
steppin
into
their
shoes
and
i
was
only
an
ordinary
young
chap
not
nor
but
honest
honest
by
god
i
was
that
did
count
it
even
stood
in
my
way
for
i
was
too
good
for
this
and
too
for
that
and
while
i
stuck
the
fairness
of
a
job
some
one
who
did
care
a
damn
whether
it
was
fair
or
not
walked
in
over
my
head
and
took
it
from
me
there
anything
i
have
tried
my
luck
at
and
with
everything
it
been
the
same
nothin
prospered
the
money
would
come
or
stick
if
it
did
and
so
here
i
am
all
that
left
of
me
it
is
much
and
by
and
by
a
few
rank
weeds
spring
from
it
and
old
joey
there
who
paid
to
grub
round
the
graves
old
joey
curse
and
say
a
weedy
fellow
that
a
rotten
weedy
blackguard
and
spit
on
his
hands
and
hoe
till
the
weeds
lie
bleedin
their
juices
the
last
heirs
of
me
the
last
issue
of
my
loins
pray
does
it
never
occur
to
you
you
fool
that
flowers
may
spring
from
you
he
had
listened
to
tangye
diatribe
in
a
white
heat
of
impatience
but
when
he
spoke
he
struck
an
easy
tone
nor
was
he
in
any
hesitation
how
to
reply
for
that
he
had
played
devil
advocate
all
too
often
with
himself
in
private
an
unlovely
country
yes
as
englishmen
understood
beauty
and
yet
not
without
a
charm
of
its
own
an
arduous
life
certainly
and
one
full
of
pitfalls
for
the
weak
or
the
unwary
yet
he
believed
it
was
no
more
impossible
to
win
through
here
and
with
clean
hands
than
anywhere
else
to
generalise
as
his
companion
had
done
was
absurd
preposterous
too
the
notion
that
those
of
their
who
had
carried
off
the
prizes
owed
their
success
to
some
superiority
in
bodily
strength
or
sharp
dealing
or
thickness
of
skin
with
tangye
permission
he
would
cite
himself
as
an
example
he
was
neither
a
very
robust
man
nor
he
ventured
to
say
one
of
any
marked
ability
in
the
other
two
directions
yet
he
had
managed
to
succeed
without
in
the
process
sacrificing
jot
or
tittle
of
his
principles
and
he
held
a
position
that
any
member
of
his
profession
across
the
seas
might
envy
him
yes
but
till
you
got
there
cried
tangye
has
every
superfluous
bit
of
you
every
thought
of
interest
that
was
essential
to
the
daily
grind
been
pared
off
if
said
mahony
stiffening
if
what
you
mean
by
that
is
have
i
allowed
my
mind
to
grow
narrow
and
sluggish
i
can
honestly
answer
no
in
his
heart
he
denied
the
charge
even
more
warmly
for
as
he
spoke
he
saw
the
great
on
which
hundreds
of
moths
and
butterflies
made
dazzling
spots
of
colour
saw
the
sheets
of
pink
between
which
his
collection
of
native
plants
lay
pressed
the
glass
case
filled
with
geological
specimens
his
bible
the
margins
of
which
round
genesis
were
black
with
his
handwriting
a
pile
of
books
on
the
new
marvel
spiritualism
colenso
pentateuch
the
big
black
volumes
of
the
arcana
coelestia
locke
on
miracles
he
saw
all
these
things
and
more
no
i
glad
to
say
i
have
retained
many
interests
outside
my
work
tangye
had
taken
off
his
spectacles
and
was
polishing
them
on
a
crumpled
handkerchief
he
seemed
about
to
reply
even
made
a
quick
towards
mahony
then
thought
better
of
it
and
went
on
rubbing
a
smile
played
round
his
lips
and
in
conclusion
let
me
say
this
went
on
mahony
not
unnettled
by
his
companion
expression
it
sheer
folly
to
talk
about
what
life
makes
of
us
life
is
not
an
active
force
it
we
who
make
what
we
will
of
life
and
in
order
to
shape
it
to
the
best
of
our
powers
tangye
to
put
our
brief
span
to
the
best
possible
use
we
must
never
lose
faith
in
god
or
our
never
forget
that
whatever
happens
there
is
a
sky
with
stars
in
it
above
us
ah
there
a
lot
of
bunkum
talked
about
life
returned
tangye
dryly
and
settled
his
glasses
on
his
nose
and
as
man
gets
near
the
end
of
it
he
sees
just
what
bunkum
it
is
life
only
got
one
meanin
doctor
seen
plain
there
only
one
object
in
everything
we
do
and
that
to
keep
a
sound
roof
over
our
heads
and
a
bite
in
our
mouths
and
in
those
of
the
helpless
creatures
who
depend
on
us
the
rest
has
no
more
sense
or
significance
than
a
nigger
hammerin
on
the
the
lucky
one
o
this
world
do
grasp
it
but
we
others
do
and
after
all
it
worth
while
havin
gone
through
it
to
have
got
at
one
bit
of
the
truth
however
small
good
night
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
before
his
words
were
cold
on
the
air
had
vanished
leaving
mahony
blankly
staring
the
moonshine
still
bathed
the
earth
gloriously
untroubled
by
the
bitterness
of
human
words
and
thoughts
but
the
night
seemed
to
have
grown
chilly
and
mahony
gave
an
involuntary
shiver
some
one
walking
over
my
now
what
would
that
specimen
have
called
it
over
the
four
by
eight
my
remains
will
one
day
manure
an
odd
abusive
fellow
he
mused
as
he
made
his
way
home
who
would
ever
have
thought
though
that
the
queer
little
chemist
had
so
much
in
him
a
failure
yes
he
was
right
there
and
as
unlovely
as
failures
always
are
at
close
quarters
but
as
he
laid
his
hands
on
the
gate
he
jerked
up
his
head
and
exclaimed
half
aloud
god
bless
my
soul
what
he
wanted
was
not
argument
or
reason
but
a
little
human
sympathy
as
usual
however
the
flash
of
intuition
came
too
late
for
such
a
touchy
nature
i
certainly
extraordinarily
obtuse
where
the
feelings
of
others
are
concerned
he
told
himself
as
he
hooked
in
the
latch
why
richard
where
have
you
been
came
mary
clear
voice
muted
so
as
not
to
disturb
john
and
jinny
who
had
retired
to
rest
purdy
and
she
sat
waiting
on
the
verandah
were
you
called
out
we
had
time
to
clear
everything
away
here
dear
i
saved
you
some
sandwiches
and
a
glass
of
claret
i
sure
you
did
get
any
supper
yourself
with
looking
after
other
people
long
after
mary
had
fallen
asleep
he
lay
wakeful
his
foolish
blunder
in
response
to
tangye
appeal
rankled
in
his
mind
he
could
not
get
over
his
insensitiveness
how
he
had
boasted
of
his
prosperity
his
moral
nicety
his
saving
pursuits
he
to
boast
when
all
that
was
asked
of
him
was
a
kindly
my
poor
fellow
soul
you
have
indeed
fought
a
hard
fight
but
there
is
a
god
above
us
who
will
recompense
you
at
his
own
time
take
the
word
for
it
of
one
who
has
also
been
through
the
slough
of
despond
and
then
just
these
these
hobbies
of
his
of
which
he
had
made
so
much
now
that
he
was
alone
with
himself
he
saw
them
in
a
very
different
light
lepidoptera
collected
years
since
were
still
unregistered
plants
and
stones
unclassified
his
poor
efforts
at
elucidating
the
bible
waited
to
be
brought
into
line
with
the
higher
criticism
home
levitations
and
called
for
investigation
while
the
leaves
of
some
of
the
books
he
had
cited
had
never
even
been
cut
the
mere
thought
of
these
things
was
provocative
to
induce
drowsiness
he
went
methodically
through
the
list
of
his
acquaintances
and
sought
to
range
them
under
one
or
other
of
headings
and
over
this
there
came
moments
when
he
lapsed
into
depths
fetched
himself
up
again
but
with
an
effort
only
to
fall
back
but
he
seemed
barely
to
have
closed
his
eyes
when
the
rang
in
an
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
applying
force
to
his
wits
he
threw
open
the
sash
who
there
what
is
it
henry
ocock
groom
i
was
to
fetch
you
out
to
our
place
at
once
governor
but
is
henry
taken
ill
not
as
i
know
of
said
the
man
dryly
but
her
and
the
boss
had
a
bit
of
a
tiff
on
the
way
home
and
madam
and
am
i
to
pay
for
their
tiffs
muttered
mahony
hotly
hush
richard
he
hear
you
warned
mary
and
sat
up
i
shall
decline
to
go
henry
a
regular
old
woman
mary
shook
her
head
you
ca
afford
to
offend
the
henrys
and
you
know
what
he
is
so
hasty
he
call
in
some
one
else
on
the
spot
and
you
never
get
back
if
only
you
had
stayed
out
so
long
dear
looking
at
the
moon
good
god
mary
is
one
never
to
have
a
moment
to
oneself
never
a
particle
of
pleasure
or
relaxation
why
richard
expostulated
his
wife
and
even
felt
a
trifle
ashamed
of
his
petulance
what
would
you
call
i
wonder
was
the
whole
evening
one
of
pleasure
and
relaxation
and
mahony
struggling
into
shirt
and
trousers
had
to
admit
that
he
would
be
hard
put
to
it
to
give
it
another
name

trotty
sat
on
a
hassock
and
rocked
a
china
babe
with
all
the
appurtenant
she
had
picked
up
from
the
tending
of
her
tiny
stepsister
the
present
trotty
was
a
demure
little
maid
of
some
seven
summers
who
gave
the
impression
of
having
been
rather
rudely
elongated
her
flaxen
hair
was
stiffly
imprisoned
behind
a
round
black
comb
and
her
big
blue
eyes
alone
remained
to
her
from
a
lovely
infancy
poor
emma
eyes
said
mary
imitative
as
a
monkey
she
went
on
with
a
child
perfect
knowledge
that
it
is
all
yet
with
an
entire
credence
in
the
power
of
naughty
child
will
you
be
quiet
there
you
frown
your
counterpane
off
now
wonder
what
next
you
do
i
declare
slap
you
soon
you
make
me
so
cross
through
the
the
words
floated
out
for
goodness
sake
do
bother
me
now
with
such
trifles
mary
it
not
the
moment
with
a
whole
string
of
people
waiting
in
the
other
room
well
if
only
you
be
satisfied
with
what
i
do
dear
and
not
blame
me
afterwards
get
purdy
to
give
you
a
hand
with
ned
affair
he
has
time
and
to
spare
and
wetting
his
mahony
nervously
flipped
over
a
dozen
pages
of
the
book
that
lay
open
before
him
well
if
you
think
i
should
said
mary
with
a
spice
of
doubt
i
do
and
now
go
wife
and
remember
to
shut
the
door
after
you
oh
and
tell
that
woman
in
the
kitchen
to
stop
singing
her
false
notes
drive
me
how
many
are
there
this
morning

no
nine
if
that
another
replied
mary
with
an
ear
to
the
front
door
tch
i
have
to
stop
then
and
mahony
clapped
to
the
work
he
had
been
consulting
never
a
minute
to
keep
abreast
of
the
times
but
that
a
good
helpful
wife
as
mary
stooped
to
kiss
him
do
the
best
you
can
mavourneen
and
never
mind
me
take
me
with
you
auntie
trotty
sprang
up
from
her
stool
overturning
babe
and
cradle
not

besides
why
are
you
here
you
know
forbidden
you
to
be
on
the
front
verandah
when
the
patients
come
run
away
to
the
back
and
play
there
mary
donned
hat
and
shawl
opened
her
parasol
and
went
out
into
the
sun
with
the
years
she
had
developed
into
rather
a
stately
young
woman
she
held
her
head
high
and
walked
with
a
firm
free
step
her
first
visit
was
to
the
stable
to
find
long
jim
or
old
jim
as
they
now
called
him
for
he
was
nearing
the
sixties
the
notice
to
leave
which
he
had
given
the
day
before
was
one
of
the
trifles
it
fell
to
her
to
consider
personally
mary
thought
his
going
would
be
no
great
loss
he
knew
nothing
about
a
garden
yet
resented
instruction
and
it
had
always
been
necessary
to
get
outside
help
in
for
the
horses
if
he
went
they
could
engage
some
one
who
would
combine
the
posts
but
richard
had
taken
umbrage
at
the
old
man
tone
had
even
been
nervously
upset
over
it
it
behoved
her
to
find
out
what
the
matter
was
i
want
a
change
said
old
jim
dourly
in
response
to
her
inquiry
and
went
on
polishing
and
making
the
wheel
fly
i
bin
too
long
an
now
i
got
a
bit
o
brass
together
an
am
thinkin
i
like
to
be
me
own
master
for
a
spell
but
at
your
age
jim
is
it
wise
to
throw
up
a
comfortable
home
just
because
you
laid
a
little
past
it
enough
to
keep
me
i
turned
over
between
four
and
five
last
week
in
oh
said
mary
taken
by
surprise
then
that
that
your
only
reason
for
wishing
to
leave
and
as
he
did
not
reply
but
went
on
swishing
come
jim
if
you
anything
on
your
mind
say
it
out
the
doctor
did
like
the
way
you
spoke
to
him
last
night
at
this
the
old
man
straightened
his
back
took
a
straw
from
between
his
teeth
spat
and
said
well
if
you
must
know
mahony
the
doctor
not
the
boss
it
pleases
me
to
be
any
more
and
the
trewth
i
tired
of
it
you
can
slave
yer
off
for
and
never
notices
a
thing
you
do
if
does
it
to
find
fault
it
i
say
and
i
be
danged
if
i
stand
it
longer
but
people
who
came
to
mary
with
criticism
of
richard
got
no
mercy
you
far
too
touchy
jim
you
know
if
any
one
does
how
rushed
and
busy
the
doctor
is
and
you
ought
to
be
the
first
to
make
allowance
for
him
after
all
he
done
for
you
you
would
be
here
now
if
it
had
been
for
him
and
then
to
expect
him
to
notice
and
praise
you
for
every
little
job
you
do
but
jim
was
stubborn
did
want
to
deny
anything
but
rather
go
an
this
day
a
week
if
it
suited
her
it
really
dreadful
how
uppish
the
lower
classes
get
as
soon
as
they
have
a
little
money
in
their
pocket
she
said
to
herself
as
she
walked
the
shadeless
sandy
road
but
this
thought
was
like
a
shadow
cast
by
her
husband
mind
on
hers
and
was
ousted
by
the
more
indigenous
but
after
all
who
can
blame
him
poor
old
fellow
for
wanting
to
take
life
easy
if
he
has
the
chance
she
even
added
he
might
have
gone
off
as
most
of
them
do
without
a
word
then
her
mind
reverted
to
what
he
had
said
of
richard
and
she
pondered
the
antagonism
that
had
shown
through
his
words
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
run
up
against
this
spirit
but
as
usual
she
was
at
a
loss
to
explain
it
why
should
people
of
old
jim
class
dislike
richard
as
they
did
find
him
so
hard
to
get
on
with
he
was
invariably
considerate
of
them
and
treated
them
very
generously
with
regard
to
money
and
yet
for
some
reason
or
other
they
felt
injured
by
him
and
thought
and
spoke
of
him
with
a
kind
of
churlish
resentment
she
was
not
clever
enough
to
find
the
key
to
the
riddle
it
was
no
such
simple
explanation
as
that
he
felt
himself
too
good
for
them
that
was
not
the
case
he
was
proud
certainly
but
she
had
never
known
any
one
who
under
it
was
true
a
rather
sarcastic
manner
was
more
broadly
tolerant
of
his
and
she
wound
up
her
soliloquy
with
the
lame
admission
yes
in
spite
of
all
his
kindness
i
suppose
he
is
queer
decidedly
queer
and
then
she
heaved
a
sigh
what
a
pity
it
was
when
you
knew
him
to
be
at
heart
such
a
dear
good
man
a
short
walk
brought
her
to
the
cottage
where
ned
lived
with
wife
and
children
or
had
lived
till
lately
he
had
been
missing
from
his
home
now
for
over
a
week
on
the
last
occasion
of
his
being
in
melbourne
with
the
he
had
decamped
leaving
the
boy
who
was
with
him
to
make
the
return
journey
alone
since
then
nothing
could
be
heard
of
him
and
his
billet
in
the
agency
had
been
snapped
up
or
so
they
say
said
his
wife
with
an
angry
sniff
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
mary
since
the
railway
come
biz
has
gone
to
the
dogs
and
they
only
too
glad
to
get
the
chance
of
sacking
another
man
polly
looked
untidier
than
ever
she
wore
a
slatternly
wrapper
and
her
hair
was
thrust
unbrushed
into
its
net
but
she
suffered
no
doubt
in
her
own
way
she
was
and
very
with
her
nestful
of
babes
sitting
in
the
cheerless
parlour
ned
eldest
on
her
knee
mary
strove
to
soothe
and
encourage
but
it
has
never
been
much
of
a
home
for
the
poor
boy
was
her
private
opinion
and
she
pressed
her
cheek
affectionately
against
the
little
black
curly
head
that
was
a
replica
of
ned
own
what
goin
to
become
of
us
all
the
lord
only
knows
said
polly
after
having
had
the
good
cry
the
sympathetic
presence
of
her
justified
i
not
a
brown
cent
troubled
about
ned
only
boiling
with
off
on
the
booze
sure
enough
and
turn
up
again
safe
and
sound
like
loose
fish
always
do
wait
till
i
catch
though
he
get
it
hot
we
never
ought
to
have
come
here
she
went
on
drying
her
eyes
drat
the
place
and
all
that
in
it
that
what
i
say
he
did
this
in
castlemaine
and
i
pa
behind
me
there
but
once
richard
had
sent
that
twenty
quid
he
no
rest
till
he
got
away
and
i
thought
when
he
was
so
set
on
it
may
be
it
have
a
good
effect
on
to
be
near
you
both
but
that
was
just
another
shoot
into
the
brown
been
mary
you
done
your
level
best
but
richard
never
treated
ned
fair
i
do
want
to
take
ned
part
he
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
noodle
but
richard
treated
as
if
he
was
the
dirt
under
feet
and
ned
felt
it
oh
i
know
whose
doing
it
was
we
were
never
asked
up
to
the
house
when
you
company
it
yours
my
dear
but
we
ca
all
have
hyphens
to
our
names
and
go
driving
round
with
kid
gloves
on
our
hands
and
our
noses
in
the
air
mary
felt
quite
depressed
by
this
fresh
attack
on
her
husband
reminding
herself
however
that
polly
was
excited
and
she
did
not
speak
out
the
defence
that
leapt
to
her
tongue
she
said
staunchly
as
you
put
it
polly
it
does
seem
as
if
we
have
acted
rightly
towards
ned
but
it
was
richard
doing
alone
i
been
just
as
much
to
blame
as
he
has
she
sat
on
petting
the
fractious
children
and
giving
kindly
assurances
as
long
as
she
and
richard
had
anything
themselves
wife
and
ned
children
should
not
want
and
as
she
spoke
she
slipped
a
substantial
proof
of
her
words
into
polly
unproud
hand
besides
she
believed
there
was
every
chance
now
of
ned
soon
being
restored
to
them
and
she
told
how
they
were
going
that
very
morning
to
invoke
smith
aid
smith
was
in
the
police
as
polly
knew
and
had
influential
friends
among
the
force
in
melbourne
by
there
might
be
good
news
to
bring
her
almost
an
hour
had
passed
when
she
rose
to
leave
ned
was
so
grateful
for
the
visit
and
the
help
that
out
in
the
narrow
little
passage
she
threw
her
arms
round
mary
neck
and
drew
her
to
her
bosom
holding
her
thus
after
several
hearty
kisses
she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
with
her
lips
close
to
mary
ear
mary
love
may
i
say
something
to
you
and
the
permission
granted
went
on
that
is
give
you
a
bit
of
a
hint
dearie
why
of
course
you
may
polly
sure
you
wo
feel
hurt
dear
quite
sure
what
is
it
and
mary
disengaged
herself
that
she
might
look
the
speaker
in
the
face
well
it
just
this
you
mentioned
the
name
yourself
or
i
have
dared
it
young
smith
mary
my
dear
in
future
do
you
have
quite
so
much
about
the
house
as
you
do
at
present
it
the
thing
people
will
talk
you
know
if
you
give
a
handle
oh
but
polly
in
a
blank
voice
from
mary
now
now
i
not
blaming
you
not
the
least
but
there
no
harm
in
being
careful
is
there
love
if
you
do
want
your
name
in
people
mouths
that
fond
of
you
mary
you
do
mind
me
speaking
dearie
no
polly
i
do
but
it
the
greatest
nonsense
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
said
mary
hotly
why
purdy
is
richard
oldest
friend
they
were
schoolboys
together
may
be
they
were
but
i
hear
mostly
up
at
your
place
when
richard
out
and
you
a
young
and
pretty
woman
my
dear
richard
who
ought
to
think
of
it
and
he
so
much
older
than
you
well
just
take
the
hint
love
it
comes
best
do
it
from
one
of
the
family
but
mary
left
the
house
in
a
sad
flurry
and
even
forgot
for
a
street
length
to
open
her
parasol
her
first
impulse
was
to
go
straight
to
richard
but
she
had
not
covered
half
a
dozen
yards
before
she
saw
that
this
would
never
do
at
the
best
of
times
richard
abominated
gossip
and
the
fact
of
it
having
in
the
present
case
dared
to
fasten
its
fangs
in
some
one
belonging
to
him
would
make
him
doubly
wroth
he
might
even
try
to
find
out
who
had
started
the
talk
and
get
himself
into
hot
water
over
it
or
he
might
want
to
lay
all
the
blame
on
his
own
shoulders
make
himself
the
reproaches
ned
polly
had
not
spared
him
worse
still
he
would
perhaps
accuse
purdy
of
inconsiderateness
towards
her
and
fly
into
a
rage
with
him
and
then
the
two
of
them
would
quarrel
which
would
be
a
thousand
pities
for
though
he
often
railed
at
purdy
yet
that
was
only
richard
way
he
was
genuinely
fond
of
him
and
unbent
to
him
as
to
nobody
else
but
these
were
just
so
many
pretexts
put
forward
to
herself
by
mary
for
keeping
silence
the
real
reason
lay
deeper
eight
years
of
married
life
had
left
her
where
certain
subjects
were
concerned
with
all
the
modesty
of
her
girlhood
intact
there
were
things
indelicate
things
which
could
not
be
spoken
out
even
between
husband
and
wife
for
her
to
have
to
step
before
richard
and
say
some
one
else
feels
for
me
in
the
same
way
as
you
my
husband
do
would
make
her
ever
after
unable
frankly
to
meet
his
eyes
besides
giving
the
vague
cobwebby
stuff
a
body
it
did
not
deserve
but
yet
again
this
was
not
the
whole
truth
she
had
another
more
uncomfortable
side
of
it
to
face
and
the
flies
buzzed
unheeded
round
her
head
the
astonishment
she
had
shown
at
her
warning
had
not
been
altogether
sincere
far
down
in
her
heart
mary
found
a
faint
faint
trace
of
complicity
for
months
past
she
could
admit
it
now
she
had
not
felt
easy
about
purdy
something
disagreeable
disturbing
had
crept
into
their
relations
the
jolly
brotherly
manner
she
liked
so
well
had
deserted
him
besides
he
had
grown
deadly
serious
and
not
the
stupidest
woman
could
fail
altogether
to
see
what
the
matter
was
but
she
had
wilfully
bandaged
her
eyes
and
if
now
and
then
some
word
or
look
had
pierced
her
guard
and
disquieted
her
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
left
it
at
an
incredulous
oh
but
then
but
even
if
in
that
case
she
now
saw
her
fervent
hope
had
been
that
the
affair
would
blow
over
without
coming
to
anything
prove
to
be
just
another
passing
fancy
on
the
part
of
the
unstable
purdy
how
many
had
she
not
assisted
at
this
very
summer
for
instance
a
charming
young
lady
from
sydney
had
stayed
with
the
urquharts
and
as
long
as
her
visit
lasted
they
had
seen
little
or
nothing
of
purdy
whenever
he
got
off
duty
he
was
at
yarangobilly
as
it
happened
however
urquhart
himself
had
been
so
assiduous
in
taking
his
guest
about
that
purdy
had
had
small
chance
of
making
an
impression
and
in
looking
back
on
the
incident
what
now
rose
most
clearly
before
mary
mind
was
the
way
in
which
urquhart
poor
thing
she
was
never
able
to
go
anywhere
with
her
husband
either
she
had
a
child
in
arms
or
another
coming
the
row
of
toddlers
mounted
up
in
steps
the
way
in
which
she
had
said
with
her
pathetic
smile
ah
my
dear
willie
needs
some
one
gayer
and
stronger
than
i
am
for
company
mary
heart
had
been
full
of
pity
at
the
time
for
her
friend
lot
and
it
swelled
again
now
at
the
remembrance
but
oh
dear
this
was
straying
from
the
point
impatiently
she
jerked
her
thoughts
back
to
herself
and
her
own
dilemma
what
ought
she
to
do
she
was
not
a
person
who
could
sit
still
with
folded
hands
and
await
events
how
would
it
be
if
she
spoke
to
purdy
herself
talked
seriously
to
him
about
his
work
tried
to
persuade
him
to
leave
ballarat
did
he
mean
to
hang
on
here
for
ever
she
would
say
never
intend
to
seek
promotion
but
then
again
the
mere
questioning
would
cause
a
certain
awkwardness
while
at
the
slightest
trip
or
blunder
on
her
part
what
was
unsaid
might
suddenly
find
itself
said
and
the
whole
thing
cease
to
be
the
vague
cloudy
affair
it
was
at
present
and
though
she
would
actually
rather
this
happened
with
regard
to
purdy
than
richard
yet
yet
worried
and
perplexed
unable
to
see
before
her
the
straight
plain
path
she
loved
mary
once
more
sighed
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
oh
if
only
men
would
be
so
foolish
left
to
himself
mahony
put
away
his
books
washed
his
hands
and
summoned
one
by
one
to
his
presence
the
people
who
waited
in
the
adjoining
room
he
drew
a
tooth
dressed
a
wounded
wrist
prescribed
for
divers
internal
disorders
all
told
a
baker
dozen
of
odd
jobs
when
the
last
patient
had
gone
he
propped
open
the
door
wiped
his
forehead
and
read
the
thermometer
that
hung
on
the
wall
it
marked
degrees
dejectedly
he
drove
in
fancy
along
the
glaring
treeless
roads
inches
deep
in
dust
how
one
learnt
to
hate
the
sun
out
here
what
would
he
give
for
a
cool
irish
day
with
a
wet
wind
blowing
in
from
the
sea
a
day
such
as
he
had
heedlessly
squandered
hundreds
of
in
his
youth
now
it
made
his
mouth
water
only
to
think
of
them
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
ten
and
the
buggy
had
not
yet
come
round
he
would
lie
down
and
have
five
minutes
rest
before
starting
he
had
been
up
most
of
the
night
and
on
getting
home
had
been
kept
awake
by
neuralgia
when
an
hour
later
mary
reached
home
she
was
amazed
to
find
groom
and
buggy
still
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
house
why
molyneux
what
the
matter
where
the
doctor
i
sure
i
do
know
mahony
i
hollered
to
biddy
half
a
dozen
times
but
she
does
take
any
notice
and
the
mare
that
restless
there
there
steady
old
girl
steady
now
it
these
damn
flies
mary
hurried
indoors
why
biddy
sure
and
it
yourself
said
the
big
irishwoman
who
now
filled
the
faith
and
though
you
scold
me
mahony
i
bring
it
over
me
heart
to
wake
him
the
pore
man
sleeping
like
a
saint
biddy
you
ought
to
know
better
cried
mary
peeling
off
her
gloves
it
pale
as
the
dead
he
is
rubbish
it
only
the
reflection
of
the
green
blind
richard
do
you
know
what
the
time
is
but
the
first
syllable
of
his
name
was
enough
good
lord
mary
i
must
have
dropped
off
what
the
dickens
come
help
me
wife
why
on
earth
did
those
fools
wake
me
mary
held
his
fetched
hat
and
gloves
while
he
flung
the
necessaries
into
his
bag
have
you
much
to
do
this
morning
oh
that
at
twelve
is
it
yes
and
a
consultation
with
munce
at
eleven
i
just
manage
it
and
no
more
muttered
mahony
with
an
eye
on
his
watch
i
ca
let
the
mare
take
it
easy
this
morning
yes
a
full
day
and
henry
fidgeting
for
a
second
opinion
thinks
his
wife
not
making
enough
progress
well
sweetheart
do
expect
me
back
to
lunch
and
taking
a
short
cut
across
the
lawn
he
jumped
into
the
buggy
and
off
they
flew
mary
thoughts
were
all
for
him
in
this
moment
how
proud
we
ought
to
feel
she
said
to
herself
that
makes
the
second
time
in
a
week
old
munce
has
sent
for
him
but
how
like
henry
ocock
she
went
on
with
puckered
brow
it
quite
insulting
after
the
trouble
richard
has
put
himself
to
if
agnes
case
puzzles
him
i
should
like
to
know
who
will
understand
it
better
i
think
i
go
and
see
her
myself
this
afternoon
it
ca
be
her
wish
to
call
in
a
stranger
not
till
some
time
after
did
she
remember
her
own
private
embarrassment
and
by
then
the
incident
had
taken
its
proper
place
in
her
mind
had
sunk
to
the
level
of
insignificance
to
which
it
belonged
such
a
piece
of
nonsense
was
her
final
verdict
as
if
i
could
worry
richard
with
it
when
he
has
so
many
really
important
things
to
occupy
him
chapter
v
yes
those
were
palmy
days
the
rate
at
which
the
practice
spread
astonished
even
himself
no
slack
seasons
for
him
now
winter
saw
him
as
busy
as
summer
and
his
chief
ground
for
complaint
was
that
he
was
unable
to
devote
the
meticulous
attention
he
would
have
wished
to
each
individual
case
it
would
need
the
strength
of
an
elephant
to
do
that
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
gratified
by
the
many
marks
of
confidence
he
received
and
if
his
work
had
but
left
him
some
leisure
for
study
and
an
occasional
holiday
he
would
have
been
content
but
in
these
years
he
was
never
able
to
get
his
neck
out
of
the
yoke
and
mary
took
her
annual
jaunts
to
melbourne
and
alone
in
a
long
talk
they
had
with
each
other
it
was
agreed
that
except
in
an
emergency
he
was
to
be
chary
of
entering
into
fresh
engagements
this
referred
in
the
first
place
to
confinements
of
which
his
book
was
always
full
and
secondly
to
outlying
the
journey
to
and
from
which
wasted
many
a
precious
hour
and
where
it
would
have
been
impolitic
to
refuse
a
new
and
influential
patient
some
one
on
his
list
a
doubtful
payer
or
a
valetudinarian
was
gently
to
be
let
drop
and
it
was
mary
who
arranged
who
this
should
be
some
umbrage
was
bound
to
be
given
in
the
process
but
with
her
help
it
was
reduced
to
a
minimum
for
mary
knew
by
heart
all
the
links
and
ramifications
of
the
houses
at
which
he
visited
knew
precisely
who
was
related
to
whom
by
blood
or
marriage
or
business
knew
where
offence
might
with
safety
be
risked
and
where
it
would
do
him
harm
she
had
also
a
woman
tact
in
smoothing
things
over
a
born
doctor
wife
declared
mahony
in
grateful
acknowledgment
for
himself
he
could
not
keep
such
fiddling
details
in
his
head
for
two
minutes
on
end
but
though
he
thus
succeeded
in
setting
bounds
to
his
activity
he
still
had
a
great
deal
too
much
to
do
and
in
tired
moments
or
when
tic
plagued
him
thought
the
sole
way
out
of
the
impasse
would
be
to
associate
some
one
with
him
as
partner
or
assistant
and
once
he
was
within
an
ace
of
doing
so
chance
throwing
what
he
considered
a
likely
person
across
his
path
in
attending
a
coroner
inquest
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
member
of
the
profession
who
was
on
his
way
from
the
ovens
district
a
coach
journey
of
well
over
two
hundred
miles
to
a
place
called
walwala
a
day
ride
to
the
west
of
ballarat
and
since
this
was
a
man
and
intelligent
though
with
a
somewhat
look
besides
being
a
stranger
to
the
town
mahony
impulsively
took
him
home
to
dinner
in
the
evening
they
sat
and
talked
the
visitor
whose
name
was
wakefield
was
considerably
mahony
senior
by
his
own
account
he
had
had
but
a
rough
time
of
it
for
the
past
couple
of
years
a
good
practice
which
he
had
worked
up
in
the
seaport
of
warrnambool
had
come
to
an
untimely
end
he
did
not
enter
into
the
reasons
for
this
i
was
unfortunate
had
a
piece
of
was
how
he
referred
to
it
and
knowing
how
fatally
easy
was
a
trip
in
diagnosis
a
slip
of
the
scalpel
mahony
tactfully
helped
him
over
the
allusion
from
warrnambool
wakefield
had
gone
to
the
extreme
north
of
the
colony
but
the
eighteen
months
spent
there
had
nearly
been
his
undoing
money
had
not
come
in
badly
but
his
wife
and
family
had
suffered
from
the
great
heat
and
the
scattered
nature
of
the
work
had
worn
him
to
skin
and
bone
he
was
now
casting
about
him
for
a
more
suitable
place
he
could
not
afford
to
buy
a
practice
must
just
creep
in
where
he
found
a
vacancy
and
walwala
where
he
understood
there
had
never
been
a
resident
practitioner
seemed
to
offer
an
opening
mahony
felt
genuinely
sorry
for
the
man
and
after
he
had
gone
sat
and
revolved
the
idea
in
the
event
of
walwala
proving
unsuitable
of
taking
wakefield
on
as
his
assistant
he
went
to
bed
full
of
the
scheme
and
broached
it
to
mary
before
they
slept
mary
made
big
eyes
to
herself
as
she
listened
like
a
wise
wife
however
she
did
not
press
her
own
views
that
night
while
the
idea
bubbled
hot
in
him
for
at
such
times
when
some
new
project
seemed
to
promise
the
millennium
he
stood
opposition
badly
but
she
lay
awake
telling
off
the
reasons
she
would
put
before
him
in
the
morning
and
in
the
dark
allowed
herself
a
tender
tickled
little
smile
at
his
expense
what
a
man
he
is
for
loading
himself
up
with
the
wrong
sort
of
people
she
reflected
and
then
afterwards
he
gets
tired
of
them
and
impatient
with
them
as
is
only
natural
at
breakfast
she
came
back
on
the
subject
herself
in
her
opinion
he
ought
to
think
the
matter
over
very
carefully
not
another
doctor
on
ballarat
had
an
assistant
and
his
patients
would
be
sure
to
resent
the
novelty
those
who
sent
for
mahony
would
not
thank
you
to
be
handed
over
to
goodness
knows
who
besides
richard
as
things
are
now
the
money
would
really
be
enough
would
it
and
just
as
we
have
begun
to
be
a
little
easy
ourselves
i
afraid
you
miss
many
comforts
you
have
got
used
to
again
dear
she
wound
up
with
a
mental
glance
at
the
fine
linen
and
smooth
service
richard
loved
yes
that
was
true
admitted
mahony
with
a
sigh
and
being
this
morning
in
a
stale
mood
he
forthwith
knocked
flat
the
it
had
amused
him
to
build
himself
he
had
only
half
believed
in
it
or
believed
so
long
as
he
refrained
from
going
into
prosaic
details
there
was
work
for
two
and
money
for
one
that
was
the
crux
of
the
matter
successful
as
the
practice
was
it
still
did
not
throw
off
a
thousand
a
year
bad
debts
ran
to
a
couple
of
hundred
annually
and
their
improved
style
of
living
the
expenses
of
house
and
garden
of
horses
and
vehicles
the
the
open
house
they
had
to
keep
swallowed
every
penny
of
the
rest
saving
was
actually
harder
than
when
his
income
had
been
but
a
third
of
what
it
was
at
present
new
obligations
beset
him
for
one
thing
he
had
to
keep
pace
with
his
colleagues
make
a
show
of
being
just
as
as
they
retrenching
was
out
of
the
question
his
patients
would
at
once
imagine
that
something
was
wrong
the
practice
on
the
downgrade
his
skill
deserting
him
and
take
their
ailments
and
their
fees
elsewhere
no
the
more
one
had
the
more
one
was
forced
to
spend
and
the
few
odd
hundreds
for
which
henry
ocock
could
yearly
be
counted
on
came
in
very
handy
as
a
rule
he
laid
these
by
for
benefit
for
her
visits
to
melbourne
her
bonnets
and
gowns
it
also
let
her
satisfy
the
needs
of
her
generous
little
heart
in
matters
of
hospitality
well
it
was
perhaps
not
fair
to
lay
the
whole
blame
of
their
incessant
and
lavish
entertaining
at
her
door
he
himself
knew
that
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
lag
a
foot
behind
other
people
hence
the
day
on
which
he
would
be
free
to
dismiss
the
subject
of
money
from
his
mind
seemed
as
far
off
as
ever
he
might
indulge
wild
schemes
of
taking
assistant
or
partner
the
plain
truth
was
he
could
not
afford
even
the
sum
needed
to
settle
in
a
locum
tenens
for
three
months
while
he
another
and
equally
valid
reason
was
that
the
right
man
for
a
locum
was
far
to
seek
as
time
went
on
he
found
himself
pushed
more
and
more
into
a
single
branch
of
medicine
one
too
he
had
never
meant
to
let
grow
over
his
head
in
this
fashion
for
it
was
common
medical
knowledge
out
here
that
given
the
distances
and
the
general
lack
of
conveniences
thirty
to
forty
maternity
cases
per
year
were
as
much
as
a
practitioner
could
with
comfort
take
in
hand
his
books
for
the
past
year
stood
at
over
a
hundred
the
nightwork
this
meant
was
unbearable
infants
showing
a
perverse
disinclination
to
enter
the
world
except
under
cover
of
the
dark
his
popularity
if
such
it
could
be
called
with
the
other
sex
was
something
of
a
mystery
to
him
for
he
had
not
one
manner
for
the
bedside
and
another
for
daily
life
he
never
sought
to
ingratiate
himself
with
people
or
to
wheedle
them
still
less
would
he
stoop
to
bully
or
intimidate
was
always
by
preference
the
adviser
rather
than
the
dictator
and
men
did
not
greatly
care
for
this
attitude
they
wrote
him
down
haughty
and
indifferent
and
pinned
their
faith
to
a
blunter
homelier
manner
but
with
women
it
was
otherwise
and
these
also
appreciated
the
fact
that
no
matter
what
their
rank
in
life
their
age
or
their
looks
he
met
them
with
the
deference
he
believed
due
to
their
sex
exceptions
there
were
of
course
affectation
or
insincerity
angered
him
with
the
zaras
of
this
world
he
had
scant
patience
while
among
the
women
themselves
some
few
ned
wife
for
example
felt
resentment
at
his
very
appearance
his
gestures
his
tricks
of
speech
but
the
majority
were
his
staunch
partisans
and
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
the
custom
to
engage
mahony
months
ahead
thus
binding
him
fast
and
though
he
would
sometimes
give
mary
a
fright
by
vowing
that
he
was
going
to
throw
up
mid
and
be
done
with
it
yet
her
ambition
and
what
an
ambitious
wife
she
was
no
one
but
himself
knew
that
he
should
some
day
become
one
of
the
leading
specialists
on
ballarat
seemed
not
unlikely
of
fulfilment
if
his
health
kept
good
and
and
if
he
could
possibly
hold
out
for
there
still
came
times
when
he
believed
that
to
turn
his
back
for
ever
on
place
and
people
would
make
him
the
happiest
of
mortals
for
a
time
this
idea
had
left
him
in
peace
now
it
haunted
him
again
perhaps
because
he
had
at
last
grasped
the
unpalatable
truth
that
it
would
never
be
his
luck
to
save
if
saving
were
the
only
key
to
freedom
he
would
still
be
there
still
chained
fast
and
though
he
lived
to
be
a
hundred
certain
it
was
he
did
not
become
a
better
colonist
as
the
years
went
on
he
had
learnt
to
hate
the
famous
climate
the
dust
and
drought
and
brazen
skies
the
drenching
rains
and
bottomless
mud
to
rebel
against
the
interminable
hours
he
was
doomed
to
spend
in
his
buggy
by
nature
he
was
a
recluse
not
an
at
all
he
was
tired
too
of
the
general
rampage
the
promiscuous
connexions
and
familiarity
of
colonial
life
sick
to
death
of
the
struggle
to
grow
richer
than
his
neighbours
he
did
give
a
straw
for
money
in
itself
only
for
what
it
brought
him
and
what
was
the
good
of
that
if
he
had
no
leisure
to
enjoy
it
or
was
it
the
truth
that
he
feared
being
dragged
into
the
vortex
of
learning
to
care
he
too
whether
or
no
his
name
topped
whether
his
entertainments
were
the
most
sumptuous
his
wife
the
woman
in
her
set
perish
the
thought
he
did
not
disquiet
mary
by
speaking
of
these
things
still
less
did
he
try
to
explain
to
her
another
more
elusive
side
of
the
matter
it
was
this
did
he
dig
into
himself
he
saw
that
his
uncongenial
surroundings
were
not
alone
to
blame
for
his
restless
state
of
mind
there
was
in
him
a
gnawing
desire
for
change
as
change
a
distinct
fear
of
being
pinned
for
too
long
to
the
same
spot
or
to
put
it
another
way
a
conviction
that
to
live
on
without
change
meant
decay
for
him
at
least
of
course
it
was
absurd
to
yield
to
feelings
of
this
kind
at
his
age
in
his
position
with
a
wife
dependent
on
him
and
so
he
fought
them
even
while
he
indulged
them
for
this
was
the
year
in
which
casting
the
question
of
expense
to
the
winds
he
pulled
down
and
rebuilt
his
house
it
came
over
him
one
morning
on
waking
that
he
could
not
go
on
in
the
old
one
for
another
day
so
cramped
was
he
so
tortured
by
its
thinness
he
had
difficulty
in
winning
mary
over
she
was
against
the
outlay
the
trouble
and
confusion
involved
and
was
only
reconciled
by
the
more
solid
comforts
and
greater
conveniences
offered
her
for
the
new
house
was
of
brick
the
first
brick
house
to
be
built
on
ballarat
and
oh
the
joy
said
richard
of
walls
so
thick
that
you
could
not
hear
through
them
had
an
verandah
which
might
be
curtained
in
for
parties
and
dances
and
a
for
patients
such
as
mary
had
often
sighed
for
as
a
result
of
the
new
grandeur
more
and
more
flocked
to
his
door
the
present
promised
to
be
a
record
year
even
in
the
annals
of
the
golden
city
the
completion
of
the
to
melbourne
was
the
outstanding
event
virtually
halving
the
distance
to
the
metropolis
in
count
of
time
it
brought
a
host
of
fresh
people
capitalists
speculators
politicians
about
the
town
and
money
grew
perceptibly
easier
letters
came
more
quickly
too
melbourne
newspapers
could
be
handled
almost
moist
from
the
press
one
no
longer
had
the
sense
of
lying
shut
off
from
the
world
behind
the
wall
of
a
tedious
coach
journey
and
the
merry
ballaratians
who
had
never
feared
or
shrunk
from
the
discomforts
of
this
journey
now
travelled
constantly
up
and
down
attending
the
melbourne
the
government
house
balls
and
bringing
back
the
gossip
of
melbourne
together
with
its
fashions
in
dress
music
and
social
life
mary
in
particular
profited
by
the
change
for
in
one
of
those
general
posts
so
frequently
played
by
the
colonial
cabinet
john
turnham
had
come
out
minister
of
railways
and
she
could
have
a
free
pass
for
the
asking
john
paid
numerous
visits
to
his
constituency
but
he
was
now
such
an
important
personage
that
his
relatives
hardly
saw
him
as
likely
as
not
he
was
the
guest
of
the
henry
ococks
in
their
new
mansion
or
of
the
mayor
of
the
borough
in
the
past
two
years
mahony
had
only
twice
exchanged
a
word
with
his
and
then
they
met
again
in
melbourne
at
six
one
january
morning
the
honourable
john
about
to
enter
a
of
the
ballarat
train
paused
with
one
foot
on
the
step
and
disregarding
the
polite
remarks
of
the
at
his
heels
screwed
up
his
prominent
black
eyes
against
the
sun
at
the
farther
end
of
the
train
a
tall
thin
man
was
peering
disconsolately
along
a
row
of
crowded
carriages
god
bless
me
is
that
why
so
it
is
and
leaving
the
official
standing
john
walked
smartly
down
the
platform
my
dear
mahony
this
is
indeed
a
surprise
i
had
no
idea
you
were
in
town
why
not
have
let
me
know
you
proposed
coming
he
inquired
as
they
made
their
way
the
train
meanwhile
held
up
on
their
account
towards
john
spacious
reserved
saloon
what
he
means
is
why
i
did
beg
a
pass
of
him
and
mahony
who
detested
asking
favours
laid
exaggerated
emphasis
on
his
want
of
knowledge
he
had
not
contemplated
the
journey
till
an
hour
beforehand
then
the
proposed
delegate
having
been
suddenly
taken
ill
he
had
been
urgently
requested
to
represent
the
masonic
lodge
to
which
he
belonged
at
the
installation
of
a
new
grand
master
ah
so
you
found
it
possible
to
get
out
of
harness
for
once
said
john
affably
as
they
took
their
seats
yes
by
a
lucky
chance
i
had
no
case
on
hand
that
could
not
do
without
me
for
hours
and
my
i
can
leave
with
perfect
confidence
to
my
wife
mary
is
no
doubt
a
very
capable
woman
i
noticed
that
afresh
when
last
she
was
with
us
returned
john
and
went
on
to
tick
off
qualities
like
a
connoisseur
appraising
the
points
of
a
horse
a
misfortune
that
she
is
not
blessed
with
any
family
he
added
mahony
stiffened
and
responded
dryly
i
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
you
with
all
her
energy
and
spirit
mary
is
none
too
strong
well
well
these
things
are
in
the
hands
of
providence
we
must
take
what
is
sent
us
and
caressing
his
bare
chin
john
gave
a
hearty
yawn
the
words
flicked
mahony
memory
john
had
had
an
addition
to
his
family
that
winter
in
the
shape
to
the
disappointment
of
all
concerned
of
a
second
daughter
he
offered
belated
congratulations
a
regular
turnham
this
time
according
to
mary
but
i
am
sorry
to
hear
jane
has
not
recovered
her
strength
oh
jane
is
doing
very
well
but
it
has
been
a
real
disadvantage
that
she
could
not
nurse
the
infant
is
well
ah
perfectly
formed
of
course
but
small
small
you
must
send
them
both
to
mary
to
be
looked
after
the
talk
then
passed
to
john
son
now
a
schoolboy
in
geelong
and
john
admitted
that
the
reports
he
received
of
the
lad
continued
as
unsatisfactory
as
ever
the
young
rascal
has
ability
they
tell
me
but
no
application
john
propounded
various
theories
to
account
for
the
boy
having
turned
out
poorly
chief
among
which
was
that
he
had
been
left
too
long
in
the
hands
of
women
they
had
overindulged
him
mary
no
more
than
the
rest
my
dear
fellow
he
hastened
to
smooth
mahony
rising
plumes
it
began
with
his
mother
in
the
first
place
yes
poor
emma
was
weak
with
the
boy
lamentably
weak
here
with
a
disconcerting
abruptness
he
drew
to
him
a
blue
linen
bag
that
lay
on
the
seat
and
loosening
its
string
took
out
a
sheaf
of
official
papers
in
which
he
was
soon
engrossed
he
had
had
enough
of
mahony
conversation
in
the
meantime
or
so
it
seemed
had
thought
of
something
better
to
do
and
did
it
his
eyed
him
as
he
read
he
a
bad
colour
been
living
too
high
no
doubt
a
couple
of
new
books
were
on
the
seat
by
mahony
but
he
did
not
open
them
he
had
a
tiring
day
behind
him
and
the
briefest
of
nights
besides
attending
the
masonic
ceremony
which
had
lasted
into
the
small
hours
he
had
undertaken
to
make
various
purchases
not
the
least
difficult
of
which
was
the
buying
of
a
present
for
mary
all
the
little
that
went
to
finish
a
lady
was
too
something
of
a
novelty
to
him
nowadays
and
he
sat
idly
watching
the
landscape
unroll
and
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
the
train
was
running
through
mile
after
mile
of
flat
treeless
country
liberally
sprinkled
with
trapstones
and
clumps
of
tussock
grass
which
at
a
distance
could
be
mistaken
for
couched
sheep
here
and
there
stood
a
solitary
most
doleful
of
trees
its
scraggy
foliage
bleached
to
grey
from
the
several
little
stations
along
the
line
mere
sheds
which
bore
a
printed
invitation
to
intending
passengers
to
wave
a
flag
or
light
a
lamp
did
they
wish
to
board
the
train
from
these
shelters
long
bare
red
roads
straight
as
ruled
lines
ran
back
into
the
heart
of
the
faded
country
now
and
then
a
moving
ruddy
cloud
on
one
of
them
told
of
some
vehicle
crawling
its
laborious
way
when
john
his
memoranda
digested
looked
up
ready
to
resume
their
talk
he
found
that
mahony
was
fast
asleep
and
since
his
first
words
loudly
uttered
did
not
rouse
him
he
took
out
his
case
chose
a
cigar
beheaded
it
and
puffed
it
alight
while
he
smoked
he
studied
his
insensible
relative
mahony
was
sitting
uncomfortably
hunched
up
his
head
had
fallen
forward
and
to
the
side
his
mouth
was
open
his
gloved
hands
lay
limp
on
his
knee
h
said
john
to
himself
as
he
gazed
and
h
he
repeated
after
an
then
pulling
down
his
waistcoat
and
generally
giving
himself
a
shake
to
rights
he
reflected
that
for
his
own
years
he
was
a
very
well
preserved
man
indeed
chapter
vi
oh
richard
and
my
dress
is
blue
said
mary
distractedly
and
sitting
back
on
her
heels
let
her
arms
fall
to
her
sides
she
was
on
her
knees
and
before
her
lay
a
cardboard
box
from
which
she
had
withdrawn
a
pink
fan
pink
satin
boots
with
stockings
to
match
and
a
pink
well
why
the
dickens
did
you
say
so
burst
out
the
giver
i
did
dear
as
plainly
as
i
could
speak
never
heard
a
word
because
you
were
listening
i
told
you
so
at
the
time
now
what
am
i
to
do
and
in
her
worry
over
the
contretemps
mary
quite
forgot
to
thank
her
husband
for
the
trouble
he
had
been
to
on
her
behalf
get
another
gown
to
go
with
them
oh
richard
how
like
a
man
after
all
the
time
and
money
this
one
has
cost
me
no
i
could
do
that
besides
agnes
ocock
is
wearing
pink
and
would
like
it
and
with
a
forehead
full
of
wrinkles
she
slowly
began
to
replace
the
articles
in
their
sheaths
of
course
they
very
nice
she
added
as
her
fingers
touched
the
delicate
textures
they
would
need
to
be
considering
what
i
paid
for
them
i
wish
now
i
kept
my
money
in
my
pocket
well
your
mistake
is
hardly
my
fault
is
it
dear
but
richard
had
gone
off
in
a
mood
midway
between
and
the
huff
mary
first
thought
was
to
send
the
articles
to
jinny
with
a
request
to
exchange
them
for
their
counterparts
in
the
proper
colour
then
she
dismissed
the
idea
blind
slave
to
her
nursery
that
jinny
was
she
would
hardly
be
likely
to
give
the
matter
her
personal
supervision
the
box
would
just
be
returned
to
the
shop
and
the
transfer
left
to
the
discretion
they
might
even
want
to
charge
more
no
another
plan
now
occurred
to
mary
agnes
ocock
might
not
yet
have
secured
the
various
small
extras
to
go
with
her
and
if
not
how
nice
it
would
be
to
make
her
a
present
of
these
they
were
finer
in
better
taste
than
anything
to
be
had
on
ballarat
and
she
had
long
owed
agnes
some
return
for
her
many
kindnesses
herself
she
would
just
make
do
with
the
simpler
things
she
could
buy
in
town
and
so
without
saying
anything
to
richard
who
would
probably
have
objected
that
henry
ocock
was
well
able
to
afford
to
pay
for
his
own
wife
finery
mary
tied
up
the
box
and
drove
to
plevna
house
on
the
outer
edge
of
yuille
swamp
oh
no
i
could
never
have
got
myself
such
beautiful
things
as
these
mary
and
henry
let
her
hands
play
lovingly
with
the
silk
stockings
her
pretty
face
with
pleasure
henry
has
no
understanding
dear
for
the
etceteras
of
a
costume
he
thinks
if
he
pays
for
a
dress
or
a
mantle
that
that
is
enough
and
when
the
little
bills
come
in
he
grumbles
at
what
he
calls
my
extravagance
i
sometimes
wish
mary
i
had
kept
back
just
a
bit
of
my
own
money
henry
would
never
have
missed
it
and
i
should
have
been
able
to
settle
a
small
bill
for
myself
now
and
then
but
you
know
how
it
is
at
first
love
our
one
idea
is
to
hand
over
all
we
possess
to
our
lord
and
master
she
tried
on
the
satin
boots
they
were
a
little
long
but
she
would
stuff
the
toes
with
wadding
if
i
am
really
not
robbing
you
mary
mary
reassured
her
and
thereupon
a
visit
was
paid
to
the
nursery
where
henry
son
and
heir
lay
sprawling
in
his
cradle
afterwards
they
sat
and
chatted
on
the
verandah
while
a
basket
was
being
filled
with
peaches
for
mary
to
take
home
not
even
the
kindly
drapery
of
a
could
conceal
the
fact
that
agnes
was
growing
stout
quite
losing
her
fine
figure
that
came
of
her
having
given
up
and
all
to
please
henry
he
did
not
ride
himself
and
felt
nervous
or
perhaps
a
little
jealous
when
his
wife
was
on
horseback
she
was
still
very
pretty
of
course
though
by
daylight
the
fine
bloom
of
her
cheeks
began
to
break
up
into
a
network
of
tiny
veins
and
her
fair
smooth
brow
bore
no
trace
of
the
tragedy
she
has
gone
through
the
double
tragedy
for
soon
after
the
master
of
dandaloo
death
in
a
melbourne
lunatic
asylum
the
little
son
of
the
house
had
died
not
yet
fourteen
years
of
age
in
an
inebriate
home
far
was
it
from
mary
to
wish
her
friend
to
brood
or
repine
but
to
have
ceased
to
remember
as
utterly
as
agnes
had
done
had
something
callous
about
it
and
in
her
own
heart
mary
devoted
a
fresh
regret
to
the
memory
of
the
poor
little
stepchild
of
fate
the
ball
for
which
all
these
silken
niceties
were
destined
had
been
organised
to
raise
funds
for
a
public
monument
to
the
two
explorers
burke
and
wills
and
was
to
be
one
of
the
grandest
ever
given
in
ballarat
his
excellency
the
governor
would
it
was
hoped
be
present
in
person
the
ladies
had
taken
extraordinary
pains
with
their
toilettes
and
there
had
been
the
usual
grumblings
at
expense
on
the
part
of
the
husbands
though
not
a
man
but
wished
and
privately
expected
his
wife
to
take
the
shine
out
of
all
the
rest
mary
had
besought
richard
to
keep
that
evening
free
it
was
her
lot
always
to
go
out
to
entertainments
under
some
one
else
wing
and
he
had
promised
to
do
his
utmost
but
a
burnt
child
in
this
respect
mary
said
she
would
believe
it
when
she
saw
it
and
the
trend
of
events
justified
her
scepticism
the
night
arrived
she
was
on
the
point
of
adjusting
her
wreath
of
before
her
mirror
when
the
dreaded
summons
came
mahony
had
to
change
and
hurry
off
without
a
moment
delay
send
for
purdy
he
see
you
across
he
said
as
he
banged
the
front
door
but
mary
despatched
the
gardener
at
a
run
with
a
note
to
tilly
ocock
who
she
knew
would
make
room
for
her
in
her
buggy
grindle
got
out
and
mary
her
bunchy
skirts
held
to
her
took
his
place
at
the
back
beside
amelia
tilly
sat
next
the
driver
and
talked
to
them
over
her
shoulder
a
great
big
jolly
rattle
of
a
woman
who
ruled
her
surroundings
autocratically
lor
no
we
left
counting
eggs
she
answered
an
inquiry
on
part
pa
got
a
brood
of
cochin
chinas
that
the
pride
and
glory
of
heart
and
built
the
neatest
little
place
for
you
could
meet
on
a
summer
day
you
must
come
over
and
admire
it
my
dear
that
please
no
end
it
was
a
condition
i
made
for
going
on
keeping
fowls
they
were
a
perfect
nuisance
all
over
the
garden
and
round
the
kitchen
and
the
back
till
it
was
safe
to
put
your
foot
down
anywhere
fowls
are
such
messy
things
at
last
i
up
and
said
i
would
have
it
any
longer
so
then
and
tom
set
to
work
and
built
themselves
a
and
a
run
and
there
they
spend
their
days
thinking
out
improvements
here
tilly
gave
the
driver
a
cautionary
dig
with
her
elbow
as
she
did
this
an
chinked
ominously
look
out
now
davy
what
you
doing
with
us
yes
that
splosh
mary
i
always
bring
a
bag
of
change
with
me
my
dear
so
that
those
who
lose
sha
have
an
excuse
for
not
paying
up
tilly
was
going
to
pass
her
evening
as
usual
at
the
well
i
hope
you
two
enjoy
yourselves
remember
now
grindle
if
you
please
that
you
a
married
woman
and
must
behave
yourself
and
not
go
in
for
any
high
jinks
she
teased
her
prim
little
stepdaughter
as
they
dismounted
from
the
conveyance
and
stood
straightening
their
petticoats
at
the
entrance
to
the
hall
you
know
matilda
i
do
not
intend
to
dance
said
mrs
amelia
in
her
sedate
fashion
it
was
as
if
she
sampled
each
word
before
parting
with
it
oh
i
know
bless
you
and
know
why
too
if
only
it
not
another
false
alarm
poor
old
pa
so
like
to
have
a
grandchild
was
allowed
to
carry
round
go
near
henry
of
course
for
fear
the
kid
swallow
one
of
dropped
aitches
and
choke
over
it
and
tilly
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
but
you
must
hurry
up
mely
you
know
if
you
want
to
oblige
really
tilly
expostulated
mary
she
sometimes
does
go
too
far
she
thought
to
herself
the
poor
little
woman
let
us
two
keep
together
she
said
as
she
took
amelia
arm
i
do
intend
to
dance
much
either
as
my
husband
is
here
but
once
inside
the
gaily
decorated
hall
she
found
it
impossible
to
keep
her
word
even
on
her
way
to
a
seat
beside
agnes
ocock
she
was
repeatedly
stopped
and
when
she
sat
down
up
came
first
one
then
another
to
request
the
pleasure
she
could
not
go
on
refusing
everybody
if
she
did
it
would
look
as
if
she
deliberately
set
out
to
be
peculiar
a
horrible
thought
to
mary
besides
many
of
those
who
made
their
bow
were
important
influential
gentlemen
for
sake
she
must
treat
them
politely
for
his
sake
again
she
felt
pleased
rightly
or
wrongly
she
put
the
many
attentions
shown
her
down
to
the
fact
of
her
being
his
wife
so
she
turned
and
offered
apologies
to
agnes
and
amelia
feeling
at
the
same
time
thankful
that
richard
had
not
henry
jealous
disposition
there
sat
agnes
looking
as
pretty
as
a
picture
and
was
afraid
to
dance
with
any
one
but
her
own
husband
and
he
preferred
to
play
at
cards
i
think
dear
you
might
have
ventured
to
accept
the
archdeacon
for
a
quadrille
she
whispered
behind
her
fan
as
agnes
regretfully
declined
long
but
agnes
shook
her
head
it
better
not
mary
it
saves
trouble
afterwards
henry
does
care
to
see
it
perhaps
agnes
herself
once
a
passionate
dancer
was
growing
a
little
too
comfortable
thought
mary
as
her
own
programme
wandered
from
hand
to
hand
among
the
last
to
arrive
was
purdy
red
with
haste
and
making
a
great
thump
with
his
lame
leg
as
he
crossed
the
floor
i
beastly
late
polly
what
have
you
got
left
for
me
why
really
nothing
purdy
i
thought
you
were
coming
but
you
may
put
your
name
down
here
if
you
like
and
mary
handed
him
her
programme
with
her
thumb
on
an
empty
space
she
generally
made
a
point
of
sitting
out
a
dance
with
purdy
that
he
might
not
feel
neglected
and
of
late
she
had
been
especially
careful
not
to
let
him
notice
any
difference
in
her
treatment
of
him
but
when
he
gave
back
the
card
she
found
that
he
had
scribbled
his
initials
in
all
three
blank
lines
oh
you
do
that
i
saving
those
for
richard
our
dance
i
believe
mrs
mahony
said
a
deep
voice
as
the
band
struck
up
the
rat
quadrilles
and
swaying
this
way
and
that
in
her
flounced
blue
tarletan
mary
rose
put
her
hand
within
the
proffered
crook
and
went
off
with
the
police
magistrate
an
elderly
greybeard
went
to
walk
or
be
teetotumed
through
the
figures
of
the
dance
with
the
supremely
sane
unconcern
that
she
displayed
towards
all
the
arts
what
odd
behaviour
murmured
henry
following
purdy
retreating
form
with
her
eyes
he
took
no
notice
of
us
whatever
and
did
you
see
amelia
how
he
stood
and
stared
after
mary
quite
rudely
i
thought
here
grindle
was
forced
to
express
an
opinion
of
her
own
always
a
trial
for
the
nervous
little
woman
i
think
it
because
dear
mary
looks
so
charming
agnes
she
ventured
in
her
mouselike
way
then
moved
up
to
make
room
for
archdeacon
long
who
laid
himself
out
to
entertain
the
ladies
it
was
after
midnight
when
mahony
reached
home
he
would
rather
have
gone
to
bed
but
having
promised
mary
to
put
in
an
appearance
he
changed
and
walked
down
to
the
town
the
ball
was
at
its
height
he
skirted
the
rotating
couples
seeking
mary
friends
hailed
him
ah
well
done
doctor
still
in
time
for
a
spin
sir
have
you
seen
my
wife
indeed
and
i
have
mahony
the
belle
o
the
ball
pleased
to
hear
it
where
is
she
now
look
here
mahony
we
had
a
dispute
cried
willie
urquhart
pressing
up
he
was
flushed
and
decidedly
garrulous
almost
came
to
blows
we
did
over
whose
was
the
finest
pair
o
shoulders
your
or
henry
i
plumped
for
and
i
she
topped
the
poll
by
jove
that
blue
gown
makes
look
just
like
what
shall
i
say
like
marble
does
fortune
smile
asked
mahony
of
henry
ocock
as
he
passed
the
he
had
cut
urquhart
short
with
a
nod
so
his
excellency
did
turn
up
after
all
sent
a
telegraphic
communication
at
the
last
moment
no
i
seen
her
but
stay
there
matilda
wanting
to
speak
to
you
i
believe
tilly
was
making
all
manner
of
signs
to
attract
his
attention
good
evening
doctor
yes
i
a
message
you
find
in
the
cloakroom
she
been
in
there
for
the
last
or
so
i
think
she
got
the
headache
or
something
of
that
sort
and
is
waiting
for
you
to
take
home
oh
thank
goodness
there
you
are
richard
cried
mary
as
he
opened
the
door
of
the
cloakroom
and
she
rose
from
the
bench
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
with
her
shawl
wrapped
round
her
i
thought
you
never
come
she
was
pale
and
looked
distressed
why
what
wrong
my
dear
feeling
faint
asked
mahony
incredulously
if
so
you
had
better
wait
for
the
buggy
it
wo
be
long
now
you
ordered
it
for
two
no
no
i
not
ill
i
rather
walk
said
mary
breathlessly
only
please
let
us
get
away
and
without
making
a
fuss
but
what
the
matter
i
tell
you
as
we
go
no
these
boots
wo
hurt
and
i
can
walk
in
them
quite
well
fetch
your
own
things
richard
her
one
wish
was
to
get
her
husband
out
of
the
building
they
stepped
into
the
street
it
was
a
hot
night
and
very
dark
in
her
thin
satin
mary
leaned
heavily
on
richard
arm
as
they
turned
off
the
into
the
unpaved
roads
mahony
let
the
lights
of
the
main
street
go
past
then
said
and
now
madam
wife
you
perhaps
be
good
enough
to
enlighten
me
as
to
what
all
this
means
yes
dear
i
will
answered
mary
obediently
but
her
voice
trembled
and
mahony
was
sharp
of
hearing
why
polly
sweetheart
surely
nothing
serious
yes
it
is
i
had
a
very
unpleasant
experience
this
evening
richard
very
unpleasant
indeed
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
i
feel
so
upset
come
out
with
it
in
a
low
voice
with
downcast
eyes
mary
told
her
story
all
had
gone
well
till
about
twelve
she
had
danced
with
this
partner
and
that
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
herself
then
came
purdy
turn
she
was
with
long
when
he
claimed
her
and
she
at
once
suggested
that
they
should
sit
out
the
dance
on
one
of
the
settees
placed
round
the
hall
where
they
could
amuse
themselves
by
watching
the
dancers
but
purdy
took
no
notice
he
was
strange
in
his
manner
from
the
very
beginning
and
led
her
into
one
of
the
little
rooms
that
opened
off
the
main
body
of
the
hall
and
i
did
like
to
object
we
were
conspicuous
enough
as
it
was
his
foot
made
such
a
bumping
noise
it
was
worse
than
ever
i
thought
for
the
same
reason
though
she
had
felt
uncomfortable
at
being
hidden
away
in
there
she
had
not
cared
to
refuse
to
stay
it
seemed
to
make
too
much
of
the
thing
besides
she
hoped
some
other
couple
would
join
them
but
but
mary
broke
from
mahony
he
was
blank
and
bewildered
purdy
however
had
got
up
after
a
moment
or
two
and
shut
the
door
and
then
oh
it
no
use
richard
i
ca
tell
you
said
poor
mary
i
do
know
how
to
get
the
words
over
my
lips
i
think
i
never
felt
so
ashamed
in
all
my
life
and
worn
out
by
the
worry
and
excitement
she
had
gone
through
and
afraid
in
advance
of
what
she
had
still
to
face
mary
began
to
cry
mahony
stood
still
let
her
arm
drop
do
you
mean
me
to
understand
he
demanded
as
if
unable
to
believe
his
ears
to
understand
that
purdy
dared
to
that
he
dared
to
behave
to
you
in
any
but
a
and
since
mary
was
using
her
and
could
not
reply
good
god
has
the
fellow
taken
leave
of
his
senses
is
he
mad
was
he
drunk
answer
me
what
does
it
all
mean
and
mary
still
continuing
silent
he
threw
off
the
hand
she
had
replaced
on
his
arm
then
you
must
walk
home
alone
i
going
back
to
get
at
the
truth
of
this
but
mary
clung
to
him
no
no
you
must
hear
the
whole
story
first
anything
rather
than
let
him
return
to
the
hall
yes
at
first
she
thought
he
really
had
gone
mad
i
ca
tell
you
what
i
felt
richard
knowing
it
was
purdy
just
purdy
to
see
him
like
that
looking
so
horrible
and
to
have
to
listen
to
the
dreadful
things
he
said
yes
i
sure
he
had
had
too
too
much
to
drink
his
breath
smelt
so
she
had
tried
to
pull
away
her
hands
but
he
had
held
her
had
put
his
arms
round
her
at
the
anger
she
felt
racing
through
her
husband
she
tightened
her
grip
stringing
meanwhile
phrase
to
phrase
with
the
sole
idea
of
getting
him
safely
indoors
not
till
they
were
shut
in
the
bedroom
did
she
give
the
most
humiliating
detail
of
any
how
while
she
was
still
struggling
to
free
herself
from
purdy
embrace
the
door
had
opened
and
grindle
looked
in
he
drew
back
at
once
of
course
but
it
was
awful
richard
i
turned
cold
it
seemed
to
give
me
more
strength
though
i
pulled
myself
away
and
got
out
of
the
room
i
do
know
how
my
wreath
was
falling
off
my
dress
was
crumpled
nothing
would
have
made
me
go
back
to
the
ballroom
i
could
have
faced
husband
i
think
i
shall
never
be
able
to
face
him
again
and
tears
flowed
anew
richard
was
stamping
about
the
room
aimlessly
moving
things
from
their
places
god
almighty
he
shall
answer
to
me
for
this
i
go
back
and
take
a
horsewhip
with
me
for
my
sake
do
have
a
scene
with
him
it
would
only
make
matters
worse
she
pleaded
but
richard
strode
up
and
down
treading
heedlessly
on
the
flouncings
of
her
dress
what
and
let
him
believe
such
behaviour
can
go
unpunished
that
whenever
it
pleases
him
he
can
insult
my
wife
insult
my
wife
make
her
the
talk
of
the
place
brand
her
before
the
whole
town
as
a
light
woman
oh
not
the
whole
town
richard
i
shall
have
to
explain
to
amelia
and
tilly
and
agnes
that
all
sobbed
mary
in
parenthesis
yes
and
i
ask
if
it
a
dignified
or
decent
thing
for
you
to
have
to
do
to
go
running
round
assuring
your
friends
of
your
virtue
cried
richard
furiously
let
me
tell
you
this
my
dear
at
whatever
door
you
knock
you
be
met
by
disbelief
fate
played
you
a
shabby
trick
when
it
allowed
just
that
low
cad
to
put
his
head
in
what
do
you
think
would
be
left
of
any
woman
reputation
after
grindle
esquire
had
pawed
it
over
no
mary
you
been
rendered
impossible
and
you
be
made
to
feel
it
for
the
rest
of
your
days
people
will
point
to
you
as
the
wife
who
takes
advantage
of
her
husband
absence
to
throw
herself
into
another
man
arms
and
to
me
as
the
convenient
husband
who
provides
the
opportunity
and
mahony
groaned
in
an
impetuous
flight
of
fancy
he
saw
his
good
name
smirched
his
practice
laid
waste
mary
lifted
her
head
at
this
and
wiped
her
eyes
oh
you
always
paint
everything
so
black
people
know
me
know
i
would
never
never
do
such
a
thing
unfortunately
we
live
among
human
beings
my
dear
not
in
a
community
of
saints
but
what
does
a
good
woman
know
of
how
a
slander
of
this
kind
clings
but
if
i
have
a
perfectly
clear
conscience
mary
tone
was
incredulous
even
a
trifle
aggrieved
it
spells
ruin
all
the
same
in
a
hole
like
this
if
it
once
gets
about
but
it
sha
i
put
my
pride
in
my
pocket
and
go
to
amelia
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
make
it
right
but
i
must
say
richard
in
the
whole
affair
i
do
think
you
feel
a
bit
sorry
for
me
or
at
least
only
for
me
as
your
wife
the
horridest
part
of
what
happened
was
mine
not
yours
and
i
think
you
might
show
a
little
sympathy
i
too
furious
to
feel
sorry
replied
richard
with
gaunt
truthfulness
still
marching
up
and
down
well
i
do
said
mary
with
a
spice
of
defiance
in
spite
of
everything
i
feel
sorry
that
any
one
could
so
far
forget
himself
as
purdy
did
you
be
telling
me
next
you
have
warmer
feelings
still
for
him
burst
out
mahony
sorry
for
the
crazy
lunatic
who
after
all
these
years
after
all
i
done
for
him
and
the
trust
i
put
in
him
suddenly
falls
to
making
love
to
the
woman
who
bears
my
name
why
a
madhouse
is
the
only
place
he
fit
for
there
you
unjust
and
wrong
too
it
it
was
as
sudden
as
you
think
purdy
has
been
queer
in
his
behaviour
for
quite
a
long
time
now
what
in
heaven
name
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
what
i
say
said
mary
staunchly
though
she
turned
a
still
deeper
red
oh
you
might
just
as
well
be
angry
with
yourself
for
being
so
blind
and
stupid
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
were
aware
of
something
mahony
stopped
short
in
his
perambulations
and
fixed
her
i
could
help
not
that
there
was
much
to
know
richard
and
i
thought
of
coming
to
you
about
it
indeed
i
did
i
tried
to
more
than
once
but
you
were
always
so
busy
i
had
the
heart
to
worry
you
for
i
knew
very
well
how
upset
you
would
be
so
it
comes
to
this
does
it
said
mahony
with
biting
emphasis
my
wife
consents
to
another
man
paying
her
illicit
attentions
behind
her
husband
back
oh
no
no
no
but
i
knew
how
fond
you
were
of
purdy
and
i
always
hoped
it
would
blow
over
without
without
coming
to
anything
god
forgive
me
cried
mahony
passionately
it
takes
a
woman
brain
to
house
such
a
preposterous
idea
oh
i
not
quite
the
fool
you
make
me
out
to
be
richard
i
got
some
sense
in
me
but
it
always
the
same
i
think
of
you
and
you
think
of
no
one
but
yourself
i
only
wanted
to
spare
you
and
this
is
the
thanks
i
get
for
it
and
sitting
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
she
wept
bitterly
will
you
assure
me
madam
that
till
nothing
i
could
have
objected
to
has
ever
passed
between
you
no
richard
i
wo
i
wo
tell
you
anything
else
you
get
so
angry
you
do
know
what
you
saying
and
if
you
ca
trust
me
better
than
that
purdy
said
you
did
understand
me
and
never
had
oh
he
did
did
he
there
we
have
it
now
i
know
every
word
the
scoundrel
has
ever
said
to
you
and
if
i
have
to
drag
it
from
you
by
force
but
mary
set
her
lips
with
an
obstinacy
that
was
something
quite
new
in
her
it
first
amazed
mahony
then
made
him
doubly
angry
one
word
gave
another
for
the
first
time
in
their
married
lives
they
quarrelled
quarrelled
hotly
and
as
always
at
such
times
many
a
covert
criticism
a
secret
disapproval
which
neither
had
ever
meant
to
breathe
to
the
other
slipped
out
and
added
fuel
to
the
fire
it
was
appalling
to
both
to
find
on
how
many
points
they
stood
at
variance
some
half
hour
later
leaving
mary
still
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
still
crying
mahony
stalked
grimly
into
the
surgery
and
taking
pen
and
paper
scrawled
without
even
sitting
down
to
do
it
you
damned
scoundrel
if
ever
you
show
your
face
here
again
thrash
you
to
within
an
inch
of
your
life
then
he
stepped
on
to
the
verandah
and
crossed
the
lawn
carrying
the
letter
in
his
hand
but
already
his
mood
was
on
the
turn
it
seemed
as
if
in
the
physical
effort
of
putting
the
words
to
paper
his
rage
had
spent
itself
he
was
conscious
now
of
a
certain
limpness
both
of
mind
and
body
his
fit
of
passion
over
he
felt
dulled
almost
indifferent
to
what
had
happened
now
too
another
feeling
was
taking
possession
of
him
opening
up
vistas
of
a
desert
emptiness
that
he
hardly
dared
to
face
but
stay
was
that
not
a
movement
in
the
patch
of
blackness
under
the
had
not
something
stirred
there
he
stopped
and
strained
his
eyes
no
it
was
only
a
bough
that
swayed
in
the
night
air
he
went
out
of
the
garden
to
the
corner
of
the
road
and
came
back
empty
handed
but
at
the
same
spot
he
hesitated
and
peered
who
there
he
asked
sharply
and
again
is
there
any
one
there
but
the
silence
remained
unbroken
and
once
more
he
saw
that
the
shifting
of
a
branch
had
misled
him
mary
was
moving
about
the
bedroom
he
ought
to
go
to
her
and
ask
pardon
for
his
violence
but
he
was
not
yet
come
to
a
stage
when
he
felt
equal
to
a
reconciliation
he
would
rest
for
a
while
let
his
troubled
balance
right
itself
and
so
he
lay
down
on
the
surgery
sofa
and
drew
a
rug
over
him
he
closed
his
eyes
but
could
not
sleep
his
thoughts
raced
and
flew
his
brain
hunted
clues
and
connections
he
found
himself
trying
to
piece
things
together
to
fit
them
in
to
recollect
and
every
now
and
then
some
sound
outside
would
make
him
start
up
and
listen
and
listen
was
that
not
a
footstep
the
step
of
one
who
might
come
feeling
his
way
with
regret
there
were
such
things
in
life
as
momentary
lapses
as
ungovernable
impulses
as
fiery
contrition
the
anguish
of
remorse
and
yet
once
more
he
sat
up
and
listened
till
his
ears
rang
then
not
the
ghostly
footsteps
of
a
delusive
hope
but
a
hard
human
crunching
that
made
the
boards
of
the
verandah
shake
tossing
off
the
which
had
grown
unbearably
heavy
he
sprang
to
his
feet
was
wide
awake
and
at
the
window
staring
into
the
dawn
before
a
human
hand
had
found
the
and
a
distracted
voice
cried
does
a
doctor
live
here
a
doctor
i
say
chapter
vii
the
hot
airless
night
had
become
the
hot
airless
day
in
the
garden
the
leaves
on
trees
and
shrubs
drooped
as
under
an
invisible
weight
all
the
stale
smells
of
the
day
before
persisted
that
of
the
medicaments
on
the
shelves
of
the
unwetted
dust
on
the
roads
the
sickly
odour
of
malt
from
a
neighbouring
brewery
the
blowflies
buzzed
about
the
ceiling
on
the
table
under
the
lamp
a
dozen
or
more
moths
lay
singed
and
dead
now
it
was
nearing
six
clad
in
his
thinnest
mahony
sat
and
watched
the
man
who
had
come
to
fetch
him
beat
his
horse
to
a
lather
mercy
have
a
little
mercy
on
the
poor
brute
he
said
more
than
once
he
had
stood
out
for
some
time
against
obeying
the
summons
which
meant
at
lowest
a
drive
not
if
he
were
offered
a
hundred
pounds
down
was
his
first
impetuous
refusal
for
he
had
not
seen
the
inside
of
a
bed
that
night
but
at
this
he
trapped
an
odd
look
in
the
other
eyes
and
suddenly
became
aware
that
he
was
still
dressed
as
for
the
ball
besides
an
equally
impetuous
answer
was
flung
back
at
him
he
promised
no
hundred
pounds
said
the
man
had
got
it
to
offer
he
appealed
solely
to
the
doctor
humanity
it
was
a
question
of
saving
a
life
that
of
his
only
son
so
here
they
were
we
doctors
have
no
business
with
troubles
of
our
own
thought
mahony
as
he
listened
to
the
detailed
account
of
an
ugly
accident
on
the
roof
of
a
shed
the
boy
had
missed
his
footing
slipped
and
fallen
some
twenty
feet
landing
astride
a
piece
of
quartering
picking
himself
up
he
had
managed
to
crawl
home
and
at
first
they
thought
he
would
be
able
to
get
through
the
night
without
medical
aid
but
towards
two
his
sufferings
had
grown
unbearable
god
only
knew
if
by
this
time
he
had
not
succumbed
to
them
my
good
man
one
does
not
die
of
pain
alone
they
followed
a
flat
treeless
road
the
grass
on
either
side
of
which
was
burnt
to
hay
buggy
and
harness
the
latter
eked
out
with
bits
of
string
and
an
old
bootlace
were
coated
with
the
dust
of
months
and
the
gaunt
horse
shuffled
through
a
reddish
flour
which
accompanied
them
as
a
choking
cloud
a
swarm
of
small
black
flies
kept
pace
with
the
vehicle
settling
on
nose
eyes
neck
and
hands
of
its
occupants
crawling
over
the
horse
belly
and
in
and
out
of
its
nostrils
the
animal
made
no
effort
to
shake
itself
free
seemed
indifferent
to
the
pests
they
were
only
to
be
disturbed
by
the
hail
of
blows
which
the
driver
occasionally
stood
up
to
deliver
at
such
moments
mahony
too
started
out
of
the
light
doze
he
was
continually
dropping
into
arrived
at
their
destination
a
miserable
wooden
shanty
on
a
at
the
foot
of
the
ranges
he
found
his
patient
tossing
on
a
dirty
bed
with
a
small
pulse
of
while
the
right
thigh
was
darkly
bruised
and
swollen
the
symptoms
pointed
to
serious
internal
injuries
he
performed
the
necessary
operation
there
was
evidently
no
woman
about
the
place
the
coffee
the
father
brought
him
was
thick
as
mud
on
leaving
he
promised
to
return
next
day
and
to
bring
some
one
with
him
to
attend
to
the
lad
for
the
he
got
a
mount
on
a
young
and
fidgety
mare
whom
he
suspected
of
not
long
having
worn
the
saddle
in
the
beginning
he
had
his
hands
full
with
her
then
however
she
ceased
her
antics
and
consented
to
advance
at
an
easy
trot
how
tired
he
felt
he
would
have
liked
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
for
a
week
on
end
as
it
was
he
could
not
reckon
on
even
an
hour
rest
by
the
time
he
reached
home
the
usual
string
of
patients
would
await
him
and
these
disposed
of
and
a
bite
of
breakfast
snatched
out
he
must
set
anew
on
his
morning
round
he
did
not
feel
well
either
the
coffee
seemed
to
have
disagreed
with
him
he
had
a
slight
sense
of
nausea
and
was
giddy
the
road
swam
before
his
eyes
possibly
the
weather
had
something
to
do
with
it
though
a
dull
sunless
morning
it
was
hot
as
he
had
never
known
it
he
took
out
a
stud
letting
the
ends
of
his
collar
fly
poor
little
mary
he
thought
inconsequently
he
had
hurt
and
frightened
her
by
his
violence
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
now
by
daylight
he
could
see
her
point
of
view
mary
was
so
tactful
and
resourceful
that
she
might
safely
be
trusted
to
hush
up
the
affair
to
explain
away
the
equivocal
position
in
which
she
had
been
found
after
all
both
of
them
were
known
to
be
decent
people
and
one
had
only
to
look
at
mary
to
see
that
here
was
no
light
woman
nobody
in
his
senses
not
even
grindle
could
think
evil
of
that
broad
transparent
brow
of
those
straight
kind
merry
eyes
no
this
morning
his
hurt
was
a
purely
personal
one
that
it
should
just
be
purdy
who
did
him
this
wrong
purdy
playmate
and
henchman
ally
in
how
many
a
boyish
enterprise
in
the
hardships
and
adventures
of
later
life
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
never
had
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
purdy
needs
he
had
fed
him
and
clothed
him
caring
for
him
as
for
a
brother
surely
few
things
were
harder
to
bear
than
a
blow
in
the
dark
from
one
who
stood
thus
deeply
in
your
debt
on
whose
gratitude
you
would
have
staked
your
head
it
was
of
course
conceivable
that
he
had
been
swept
off
his
feet
by
mary
vivid
young
beauty
by
by
the
glamour
of
the
moment
but
if
a
man
could
not
restrain
his
impulses
where
the
wife
of
his
most
intimate
friend
was
concerned
another
thing
as
long
as
mary
had
remained
an
immature
slip
of
a
girl
purdy
had
not
given
her
a
thought
when
however
under
her
husband
wing
she
had
blossomed
out
into
a
lovely
womanhood
of
which
any
man
might
be
proud
then
she
had
found
favour
in
his
eyes
and
the
slight
this
put
on
mary
sterling
moral
qualities
on
all
but
her
physical
charms
left
the
worst
taste
of
any
in
the
mouth
then
not
content
with
trying
to
steal
her
love
purdy
had
also
sought
to
poison
her
mind
against
him
how
that
rankled
for
until
now
he
had
hugged
the
belief
that
purdy
opinion
of
him
was
coloured
by
affection
and
respect
by
the
tradition
of
years
whereas
from
what
mary
had
let
fall
he
saw
that
the
boy
must
have
been
sitting
in
judgment
on
him
regarding
his
peculiarities
with
an
unloving
eye
picking
his
motives
to
pieces
it
was
like
seeing
the
child
of
your
loins
of
your
hopes
your
unsleeping
care
turn
and
rend
you
with
black
ingratitude
yes
everything
went
to
prove
purdy
unworthiness
only
he
had
not
seen
it
only
he
had
been
blind
to
the
truth
and
wrapped
in
this
smug
blindness
he
had
given
his
false
friend
the
run
of
his
home
setting
after
the
custom
of
the
country
no
veto
on
his
eternal
presence
disloyalty
was
certainly
abetted
by
just
the
extravagant
exaggerated
hospitality
of
colonial
life
never
must
the
doors
of
your
house
be
shut
all
you
had
you
were
expected
to
share
with
any
sundowner
of
fortune
who
chanced
to
stop
at
your
gate
the
mare
shied
with
a
suddenness
that
almost
unseated
him
the
next
moment
she
had
the
bit
between
her
teeth
and
was
galloping
down
the
road
went
her
hoofs
on
the
baked
clay
the
dust
smothered
and
stung
and
he
was
holding
for
all
he
was
worth
to
reins
spanned
stiff
as
iron
on
they
flew
his
body
hammered
the
saddle
his
breath
came
sobbingly
but
he
kept
his
seat
and
a
couple
of
miles
farther
on
he
was
down
soothing
the
quivering
sweating
beast
whose
nostrils
worked
like
a
pair
of
bellows
there
he
stood
glancing
now
back
along
the
road
now
up
at
the
sky
his
hat
had
gone
flying
at
the
first
unexpected
plunge
he
ought
to
return
and
look
for
it
but
he
shrank
from
the
additional
fatigue
the
delay
in
reaching
home
this
would
mean
the
sky
was
still
overcast
he
decided
to
risk
it
knotting
his
handkerchief
he
spread
it
over
his
head
and
got
back
into
the
saddle
mine
own
familiar
friend
and
more
than
that
he
could
add
to
plaint
and
say
my
only
friend
in
purdy
the
one
person
he
had
been
intimate
with
passed
out
of
his
life
there
was
nobody
to
take
the
vacant
place
he
had
been
far
too
busy
of
late
years
to
form
new
friendships
what
was
left
of
him
after
the
day
work
was
done
was
but
a
kind
of
shell
the
work
was
the
meaty
contents
as
you
neared
the
forties
too
it
grew
ever
harder
to
fit
yourself
to
other
people
your
outlook
had
become
too
set
your
ideas
too
unfluid
hence
you
clung
the
faster
to
ties
formed
in
the
old
golden
days
worn
though
these
might
be
to
the
thinness
of
a
hair
and
then
there
was
one
wife
of
course
one
dear
good
wife
but
just
her
very
dearness
and
goodness
served
to
hold
possible
intimates
at
arm
length
the
knowledge
that
you
had
such
a
confidante
that
all
your
thoughts
were
shared
with
her
struck
disastrously
at
a
free
exchange
of
privacies
no
he
was
alone
he
had
not
so
much
as
a
dog
now
to
follow
at
heel
and
look
up
at
him
with
the
melancholy
eyes
of
its
race
old
pompey
had
come
at
poison
and
mary
had
not
wished
to
have
a
strange
dog
in
the
new
house
she
did
not
care
for
animals
and
the
main
charge
of
it
would
have
fallen
on
her
he
had
no
time
no
time
even
for
a
dog
better
it
would
assuredly
be
to
have
some
one
to
fall
back
on
it
was
not
good
for
a
man
to
stand
so
alone
did
troubles
come
they
would
strike
doubly
hard
because
of
it
then
was
the
time
to
rejoice
in
a
warm
human
handclasp
and
moodily
pondering
the
reasons
for
his
solitariness
he
was
once
more
inclined
to
lay
a
share
of
the
blame
on
the
conditions
of
the
life
the
population
of
the
place
was
still
in
a
state
of
flux
he
and
a
mere
handful
of
others
would
soon
he
believed
be
the
oldest
residents
in
ballarat
people
came
and
went
tried
their
luck
failed
and
flitted
off
again
much
as
in
the
early
days
what
was
the
use
of
troubling
to
become
better
acquainted
with
a
person
when
just
as
you
began
really
to
know
him
he
was
up
and
away
at
home
in
the
old
country
a
man
as
often
as
not
died
in
the
place
where
he
was
born
and
the
slow
eventless
years
spent
shoulder
to
shoulder
automatically
brought
about
a
kind
of
intimacy
but
this
was
only
a
surface
reason
there
was
another
that
went
deeper
he
had
no
talent
for
friendship
and
he
knew
it
indeed
he
would
even
invert
the
thing
and
say
bluntly
that
his
nature
had
a
twist
in
it
which
directly
hindered
friendship
and
this
though
there
came
moments
when
he
longed
as
your
popular
mortal
never
did
for
close
companionship
sometimes
he
felt
like
a
hungry
man
looking
on
at
a
banquet
of
which
no
one
invited
him
to
partake
because
he
had
already
given
it
to
be
understood
that
he
would
decline
but
such
lapses
were
few
on
nine
days
out
of
ten
he
did
not
feel
the
need
of
either
making
or
receiving
confidences
he
shrank
rather
with
a
peculiar
shy
dread
from
personal
unbosomings
some
imp
housed
in
him
some
wayward
wilful
mocking
irish
devil
bidding
him
hold
back
remain
cool
in
face
of
others
joys
and
pains
hence
the
break
with
purdy
was
a
real
calamity
the
associations
of
some
years
were
bound
up
in
it
measured
by
it
one
marriage
seemed
a
thing
of
yesterday
and
even
more
than
the
friend
he
would
miss
the
friendship
and
all
it
stood
for
this
solid
base
of
joint
experience
this
past
of
common
memories
into
which
one
could
dip
as
into
a
well
this
handle
of
do
you
remember
which
opened
the
door
to
such
a
wealth
of
anecdote
from
now
on
the
better
part
of
his
life
would
be
a
closed
book
to
any
but
himself
there
were
allusions
jests
without
number
homely
turns
of
speech
which
not
a
soul
but
himself
would
understand
the
thought
of
it
made
him
feel
old
and
empty
affected
him
like
the
news
of
a
but
must
it
be
was
there
no
other
way
out
slow
to
take
hold
he
was
a
hundred
times
slower
to
let
go
before
now
he
had
seen
himself
sticking
by
a
person
through
misunderstandings
ingratitude
deception
to
the
blank
wonder
of
the
onlookers
would
he
not
be
ready
here
too
to
forgive
to
forget
but
he
felt
hot
hot
to
suffocation
and
his
heart
was
pounding
in
uncomfortable
fashion
the
idea
of
stripping
and
plunging
into
water
began
to
make
a
delicious
appeal
to
him
nothing
surpassed
such
a
plunge
after
a
broken
night
but
of
late
he
had
had
to
be
wary
of
indulging
a
bath
of
this
kind
taken
when
he
was
was
apt
to
set
the
accursed
tic
and
then
he
could
pace
the
floor
in
agony
and
yet
good
god
how
hot
it
was
his
head
ached
distractedly
an
iron
band
of
pain
seemed
to
encircle
it
with
a
sudden
start
of
alarm
he
noticed
that
he
had
ceased
to
perspire
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
not
even
the
wild
gallop
had
induced
perspiration
pulling
up
short
he
fingered
his
pulse
it
was
abnormal
even
for
him
and
feeble
was
it
fancy
or
did
he
really
find
a
difficulty
in
breathing
he
tore
off
his
collar
threw
open
the
neck
of
his
shirt
he
had
a
sensation
as
if
all
the
blood
in
his
body
was
flying
to
his
head
his
face
must
certainly
be
crimson
he
put
both
hands
to
this
head
to
support
it
and
in
a
blind
fit
of
vertigo
all
but
lost
his
balance
in
the
saddle
the
trees
spun
round
the
distance
went
black
for
a
second
still
he
kept
upright
then
he
flopped
to
the
ground
falling
face
downwards
his
arms
huddled
under
him
the
mare
all
her
spirit
gone
stood
and
waited
as
he
did
not
stir
she
turned
and
sniffed
at
him
curiously
still
he
lay
prone
and
having
stretched
her
tired
jaws
she
raised
her
head
and
uttered
a
whinny
an
almost
human
cry
of
distress
this
too
failing
in
its
effect
she
nosed
the
ground
for
a
few
yards
then
set
out
at
a
gentle
trot
for
home
found
a
dark
conspicuous
heap
on
the
long
bare
road
and
carted
back
to
town
by
a
passing
mahony
lay
once
the
coma
had
yielded
and
tossed
in
fever
and
delirium
by
piecing
his
broken
utterances
together
mary
learned
all
she
needed
to
know
about
the
case
he
had
gone
out
to
attend
and
his
desperate
ride
home
but
it
was
purdy
name
that
was
oftenest
on
his
lips
it
was
purdy
he
reviled
and
implored
and
when
he
sprang
up
with
the
idea
of
calling
his
false
friend
to
account
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
restrain
him
she
had
the
best
of
advice
old
munce
himself
came
two
and
three
times
a
day
mary
had
always
thought
him
a
dear
old
man
and
she
felt
surer
than
ever
of
it
when
he
stood
patting
her
hand
and
bidding
her
keep
a
good
heart
for
they
would
certainly
pull
her
husband
through
there
are
so
many
of
his
kind
here
mahony
that
we
can
afford
to
lose
him
but
altogether
she
had
never
known
till
now
how
many
and
how
faithful
their
friends
were
hardly
for
instance
had
richard
been
carried
in
stiff
as
a
log
and
grey
as
death
when
good
devine
was
fumbling
with
the
latch
of
the
gate
an
old
sunbonnet
perched
crooked
on
her
head
she
had
run
down
just
as
she
was
in
the
midst
of
shelling
peas
for
dinner
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
help
with
the
nursing
but
mary
felt
bound
to
refuse
she
knew
how
the
thought
of
what
he
might
have
said
in
his
delirium
would
worry
richard
when
he
recovered
his
senses
few
men
laid
such
weight
as
he
on
keeping
their
private
thoughts
private
not
to
be
done
devine
installed
herself
in
the
kitchen
to
superintend
the
cooking
less
for
the
patient
into
whom
at
first
only
liquid
nourishment
could
be
injected

the
house
while
mary
slept
archdeacon
long
was
also
a
frequent
visitor
bringing
not
so
much
spiritual
as
physical
aid
for
as
the
frenzy
reached
its
height
and
richard
was
maddened
by
the
idea
that
a
plot
was
brewing
against
his
life
a
pair
of
strong
arms
were
needed
to
hold
him
down
over
and
above
this
letters
of
sympathy
flowed
in
grateful
patients
called
to
ask
with
tears
in
their
eyes
how
the
doctor
did
virtual
strangers
stopped
the
servant
in
the
street
with
the
same
query
mary
was
sometimes
quite
overwhelmed
by
the
kindness
people
showed
her
the
days
that
preceded
the
crisis
were
days
of
keenest
anxiety
but
mary
never
allowed
her
heart
to
fail
her
for
if
in
the
small
things
of
life
she
was
given
to
building
on
a
mortal
good
sense
how
much
more
could
she
rely
at
such
a
pass
on
the
sense
of
the
one
above
all
others
what
she
said
to
herself
as
she
moved
tirelessly
about
the
sick
room
damping
cloths
filling
the
infiltering
drops
of
nourishment
was
god
is
good
and
these
words
far
from
breathing
a
pious
resignation
voiced
a
confidence
so
bold
that
it
bordered
on
irreverence
their
real
meaning
was
richard
has
still
ever
so
much
work
to
do
in
the
world
curing
sick
people
and
saving
their
lives
god
must
know
this
and
can
not
now
mean
to
be
so
foolish
as
to
waste
him
by
letting
him
die
and
her
reliance
on
the
almighty
wisdom
was
justified
richard
weathered
the
crisis
slowly
revived
to
life
and
health
and
the
day
came
when
laying
a
thin
white
hand
on
hers
he
could
whisper
my
poor
little
wife
what
a
fright
i
must
have
given
you
and
added
i
think
an
illness
of
some
kind
was
due
overdue
with
me
when
he
was
well
enough
to
bear
the
journey
they
left
home
for
a
on
the
bay
there
on
an
open
beach
facing
the
heads
mahony
lay
with
his
hat
pulled
forward
to
shade
his
eyes
and
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
scoop
up
handfuls
of
the
fine
coral
sand
and
let
it
flow
again
like
liquid
silk
through
his
fingers
from
beneath
the
brim
he
watched
the
water
churn
and
froth
on
the
brown
reefs
followed
the
which
beginning
as
mere
dots
on
the
horizon
swelled
to
stately
white
waterbirds
and
shrivelled
again
to
dots
drank
in
with
greedy
nostrils
the
mixed
spice
of
warm
sea
hot
seaweed
and
aromatic
and
his
strength
came
back
as
rapidly
as
usual
he
soon
felt
well
enough
leaning
on
mary
arm
to
stroll
up
and
down
the
sandy
roads
of
the
township
to
open
book
and
newspaper
and
finally
to
descend
the
cliffs
for
a
dip
in
the
transparent
turquoise
sea
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
was
at
home
again
sunburnt
and
hearty
eager
to
pick
up
the
threads
he
had
let
fall
and
soon
mary
was
able
to
make
the
comfortable
reflection
that
everything
was
going
on
just
as
before
in
this
however
she
was
wrong
never
in
their
united
lives
would
things
be
quite
the
same
again
outwardly
the
changes
might
pass
unnoticed
though
even
here
it
was
true
a
certain
name
had
now
to
be
avoided
with
which
they
had
formerly
made
free
but
this
was
not
exactly
hard
to
do
purdy
having
promptly
disappeared
they
heard
at
that
he
had
at
last
accepted
promotion
and
gone
to
melbourne
and
since
mary
had
suffered
no
inconvenience
from
his
thoughtless
conduct
they
tacitly
agreed
to
let
the
matter
rest
that
was
on
the
surface
inwardly
the
differences
were
more
marked
even
in
the
mental
attitude
they
adopted
towards
what
had
happened
husband
and
wife
were
thoroughly
dissimilar
mary
did
not
refer
to
it
because
she
thought
it
would
be
foolish
to
so
disagreeable
a
subject
in
her
own
mind
however
she
faced
it
frankly
dating
back
to
it
as
the
night
when
purdy
had
been
so
odious
and
richard
so
angry
mahony
on
the
other
hand
gave
the
affair
a
wide
berth
even
in
thought
for
him
it
was
a
kind
of
pandora
box
of
which
having
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
contents
he
did
not
again
dare
to
raise
the
lid
things
might
escape
from
it
that
would
alter
his
whole
life
but
he
too
dated
from
it
in
the
sense
of
suddenly
becoming
aware
with
a
throb
of
regret
that
he
had
left
his
youth
behind
him
and
such
phrases
as
when
i
was
young
in
my
younger
days
now
fell
instinctively
from
his
lips
nor
was
this
all
deep
down
in
mary
soul
there
slumbered
a
slight
embarrassment
one
she
could
not
get
the
better
of
it
spread
and
grew
this
was
a
faint
ever
so
faint
a
doubt
of
richard
wisdom
odd
she
had
long
known
him
to
be
different
in
many
small
and
some
great
ways
from
those
they
lived
amongst
but
hitherto
this
very
oddness
of
his
had
seemed
to
her
an
outgrowth
on
the
side
of
superiority
fairer
judgment
higher
motives
just
as
she
had
always
looked
up
to
him
as
rectitude
in
person
so
she
had
thought
him
the
embodiment
of
a
fine
though
somewhat
unworldly
wisdom
now
her
faith
in
his
discernment
was
shaken
his
treatment
of
her
on
the
night
of
the
ball
had
shocked
confused
her
she
was
ready
to
make
allowance
for
him
she
had
told
her
story
clumsily
and
had
afterwards
been
both
cross
and
obstinate
while
part
of
his
violence
was
certainly
to
be
ascribed
to
his
coming
breakdown
but
this
did
not
cover
everything
and
the
ungenerous
spirit
in
which
he
had
met
her
frankness
his
doubt
of
her
word
of
her
good
faith
his
utter
unreasonableness
in
short
had
left
a
cold
patch
of
astonishment
in
her
which
would
not
yield
she
lit
on
it
at
unexpected
moments
meanwhile
she
groped
for
an
epithet
that
would
fit
his
behaviour
beginning
with
some
rather
vague
and
terms
she
gradually
came
down
until
with
the
sense
of
having
found
the
right
thing
at
last
she
fixed
on
the
adjective
silly
a
word
which
for
the
rest
was
in
common
use
with
mary
had
she
to
describe
anything
that
struck
her
as
queer
or
extravagant
and
sitting
over
her
fancywork
into
which
being
what
richard
called
safe
as
the
grave
she
sewed
more
thoughts
than
most
women
sitting
thus
she
would
say
to
herself
with
a
half
smile
and
an
incredulous
shake
of
the
head
so
silly
but
hers
was
one
of
those
inconvenient
natures
which
trust
blindly
or
not
at
all
once
worked
on
by
a
doubt
or
a
suspicion
they
are
never
able
to
shake
themselves
free
of
it
again
as
time
went
on
she
suffered
strange
uncertainties
where
some
of
richard
decisions
were
concerned
in
his
good
intentions
she
retained
an
implicit
belief
but
she
was
not
always
satisfied
that
he
acted
in
the
wisest
way
occasionally
it
struck
her
that
he
did
not
see
as
clearly
as
she
did
at
other
times
that
he
let
a
passing
whim
run
away
with
him
and
override
his
common
sense
and
her
eyes
thus
opened
it
was
not
in
mary
to
stand
dumbly
by
and
watch
him
make
what
she
held
to
be
mistakes
openly
to
interfere
however
would
also
have
gone
against
the
grain
in
her
she
had
bowed
for
too
long
to
his
greater
age
and
experience
so
seeing
no
other
way
out
she
fell
back
on
indirect
methods
to
her
regret
for
in
watching
other
women
manage
their
husbands
she
had
felt
proud
to
think
that
nothing
of
this
kind
was
necessary
between
richard
and
her
now
she
too
began
to
lay
little
schemes
by
which
without
his
being
aware
of
it
she
might
influence
his
judgment
divert
or
modify
his
plans
her
enforced
use
of
such
tactics
did
not
lessen
the
admiring
affection
she
bore
him
that
was
framed
to
withstand
harder
tests
indeed
she
was
even
aware
of
an
added
tenderness
towards
him
now
she
saw
that
it
behoved
her
to
have
forethought
for
them
both
but
into
the
wife
love
for
her
husband
there
crept
something
of
a
mother
love
for
her
child
for
a
wayward
and
impulsive
yet
gifted
creature
whose
welfare
and
happiness
depended
on
her
alone
and
it
is
open
to
question
whether
the
mother
dormant
in
mary
did
not
fall
with
a
kind
of
hungry
joy
on
this
task
the
work
of
her
hands
done
she
had
known
empty
hours
that
was
over
now
with
quickened
faculties
all
her
senses
on
the
alert
she
watched

with

of

after

a
worker
for
the
greater

his
life
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
to
work
on
to
the
end
yes
that
mary
could
understand
and
agree
with
but
richard
continued
all
it
means
of
course
is
that
the
poor
fellow
is
beginning
to
prepare
for
his
last
long
journey
these
aches
and
pains
of
his
represent
the
packing
and
the
strapping
without
which
not
even
a
short
earthly
journey
can
be
undertaken
and

is
into

mary
making
lace
over

looked
up
at
this
a
trifle
apprehensively
what
things
you
do
say
if
any
one
heard
you
think
you
were
very
very
religious
her
fear
lest
outspokenness
should
be
mistaken
for
impiety
never
left
her
tilly
was
plain
and

the
point

the
image
of
her
mother
entirely
gone
was
the
slight
crust
of
acerbity
that
had
threatened
her
in
her
maiden
days
when
thanks
to
her
misplaced
affections
it
had
seemed
for
a
time
as
if
the
purple
prizes
of
life
love
offers
of
marriage
a
home
of
her
own
were
going
to
pass
her
by
she
was
now
a
stout
woman
with
a
roar
of
a
laugh
full
yet
firm
lips
and
the
whitest
of
teeth
mary
thought
her
decidedly
toned
down
and
improved
since
her
marriage
but
mahony
put
it
that
the
means
tilly
now
had
at
her
disposal
were
such
as
to
make
people
shut
an
eye
to
her
want
of
refinement
however
that
might
be
old
ocock
was
welcomed
everywhere
even
by
those
on
whom
her
bouncing
manners
grated
she
was
invariably
clad
in
a
thick
and
handsome
black
silk
gown
over
which
she
wore
all
the
jewellery
she
could
crowd
on
her
person
huge
cameo
brooches
rings
and
bracelets
lockets
and
chains
her
name
topped
and
having
early
weaned
her
old
husband
of
his
dissenting
habits
she
was
a
real
prop
to
archdeacon
long
and
his
church
taking
the
chief
and
most
expensive
table
at
the
most
thankless
stall
at
bazaars
she
kept
open
house
too
and
gave
delightful
parties
where
while
some
sat
at
loo
others
were
free
to
turn
the
rooms
for
a
dance
or
to
ransack
wardrobes
and
presses
for
costumes
for
charades
she
drove
herself
and
her
friends
about
in
various
vehicles
briskly
and
well
and
indulged
besides
in
many
secret
charities
her
husband
thought
no
such
woman
had
ever
trodden
the
earth
and
publicly
blessed
the
day
on
which
he
first
set
eyes
on
her
after
the
dose
i
with
me
first
was
a
bit
of
a
risk
that
i
knew
and
it
put
me
off
me
sleep
for
a
night
or
two
but
my
tilly
the
queen
o
women
i
say
the
queen
sir
i
never
a
wrong
word
from
an
when
i
go
she
gits
every
penny
i
got
why
i
jiggered
if
she
did
stop
at
from
the
races

all
on
my
account
now
then
pa
drop
it
or
the
doctor
think
you
been
mixing
your
liquors
give
your
old
pin
here
and
let
me
poultice
it
he
had
another
sound
reason
for
gratitude
somewhere
in
the
background
of
his
house
dwelt
his
two
sons
tilly
had
accepted
their
presence
uncomplainingly
indeed
she
sometimes
stood
up
for
tom
against
his
father
now
pa
stop
nagging
at
the
boy
will
you
never
get
anything
out
of
that
way
tom
right
enough
if
you
know
how
to
take
him
he
never
set
the

on

that
what
you

i
thankful
i
can
tell
you
to
have
a
handy

so
tom

half
a

the
truth
is
mary
for
all
they
say
to
the
opposite
men
are
harder
than
women
so
just
because
tom
made
a
slip
once
they
never
let
forget
it
but
tied
it

and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
tom
as
sedoocer
can
you
picture
it
mary
it
enough
to
make
one
split
and
with
a
meaning
glance
at
her
friend
tilly
broke
out
in
a
contagious
peal
of
laughter
as
for
johnny
well
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
a
bad
bad
mary
and
no
amount
o
cooking
and
doctoring
sweeten
it
but
he
did
make
did
and
my
opinion
is
parents
should
look
to
themselves
a
bit
more
than
they
do
as
she
spoke
she
threw
open
the
door
of
the
little
room
where
johnny
housed
it
was
an
odd
place
the
walls
were
plastered
over
with
with
old
prints
from
illustrated
journals
with
snippets
torn
off
valentines
and
keepsakes
stuck
one
on
another
these
formed
a
kind
of
loose
wallpaper
which
stirred
in
the
draught
tilly
went
on
i
see
myself
to
it
being
kept
cleanish
hates
the
girl
to
come
bothering
round
oh
just
johnny
rubbish
for
mary
had
stooped
curiously
to
the
table
which
was
littered
with
a
queer
collection
of
objects
matchboxes
on
wheels
empty
reels
of
cotton
threaded
on
strings
bits
of
wood
shaped
in
rounds
and
squares
boxes
made
of
paper
dried
seaweed
glued
in
patterns
on
strips
of
cardboard
for
ever
pottering
about
with
what
amusement
gets
out
of
it
only
the
lord
can
tell
she
did
not
mention
the
fact
known
to
mary
that
when
johnny
had
a
it
was
she
who
looked
after
him
got
him
comfortably
to
bed
and
made
shift
to
keep
the
noise
from
his
father
ears
yes
tilly
charity
seemed
sheerly
inexhaustible
again
there
was
the
case
of
jinny
children
for
in
this
particular
winter
tilly
had
exchanged
her
black
silk
for
a
stuff
gown
heavily
trimmed
with
crepe
she
was
in
mourning
for
poor
jinny
who
had
died
not
long
after
giving
birth
to
a
third
daughter
died
of
the
daughter
in
more
senses
than
one
was
tilly
verdict
john
had
certainly
been
extremely
put
out
at
the
advent
of
yet
another
girl
and
the
probability
was
that
jinny
had
taken
his
reproaches
too
much
to
heart
however
it
was
she
could
not
rally
and
one
day
mary
received
a
telegram
saying
that
if
she
wished
to
see
jinny
alive
she
must
come
at
once
no
mention
was
made
of
tilly
but
mary
ran
to
her
with
the
news
and
tilly
declared
her
intention
of
going
too
i
suppose
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
to
my
own
sister
even
though
i
not
a
honourable
not
that
jinn
and
i
ever
really
drew
together
she
continued
as
the
train
bore
them
over
the
ranges
she
too
much
of
poor
pa
in
and
i
was
all
ma
hard
luck
that
it
must
just
be
her
who
managed
to
get
such
a
domineering
brute
for
a
husband
you
excuse
me
mary
you
a
domineering
brute
and
to
think
i
once
envied
her
the
match
she
went
on
meditatively
removing
her
bonnet
and
substituting
a
kind
of
nightcap
intended
to
keep
her
hair
free
from
dust
lauks
mary
it
a
good
thing
fate
does
always
take
us
at
our
word
we
do
know
which
side
our
bread
buttered
on
and
that
the
truth
why
my
dear
i
exchange
my
old
boy
for
all
the
honourables
in
creation
they
were
in
time
to
take
leave
of
jinny
lying
white
as
her
pillows
behind
the
red
rep
hangings
of
the
bed
the
bony
parts
of
her
face
had
sprung
into
prominence
her
large
soft
eyes
fallen
in
john
stalking
solemnly
and
noiselessly
in
a
long
black
coat
himself
led
the
two
women
to
the
bedroom
where
he
left
them
they
sat
down
one
on
each
side
of
the
great
fourposter
jinny
hardly
glanced
at
her
sister
it
was
mary
she
wanted
mary
hand
she
fumbled
for
while
she
told
her
trouble
it
the
children
mary
she
whispered
i
ca
die
happy
because
of
the
children
john
does
understand
them
jinny
whole
existence
was
bound
up
in
the
three
little
ones
she
had
brought
into
the
world
dearest
jinny
do
fret
i
look
after
them
for
you
and
take
care
of
them
promised
mary
wiping
away
her
tears
i
thought
so
said
the
dying
woman
relieved
but
without
gratitude
it
seemed
but
natural
to
her
who
was
called
upon
to
give
up
everything
that
those
remaining
should
make
sacrifices
her
fingers
plucked
at
the
sheet
john
been
good
to
me
she
went
on
with
closed
eyes
but
if
it
been
for
the
children
yes
the
children
i
think
i
done
better
her
speech
lapsed
oddly
after
her
years
of
patient
practice
to
taken
to
taken
the
name
remained
unspoken
tilly
raised
astonished
eyebrows
at
mary
wandering
she
telegraphed
in
forming
the
word
very
largely
and
distinctly
for
neither
knew
of
jinny
having
had
any
but
her
one
glorious
chance
tilly
big
heart
yearned
over
her
sister
forlorn
little
ones
they
could
be
heard
bleating
like
lambs
for
the
mother
to
whom
till
now
they
had
never
cried
in
vain
her
instant
idea
was
to
gather
all
three
up
in
her
arms
and
carry
them
off
to
her
own
roomy
childless
home
where
she
would
have
given
them
a
delightful
though
not
maybe
a
particularly
discriminating
upbringing
but
the
funeral
over
the
blinds
raised
the
two
ladies
and
the
elder
babes
clad
in
the
stiff
expensive
mourning
that
befitted
the
widower
social
position
john
put
his
foot
down
and
to
mary
was
extremely
explicit
under
no
circumstances
will
i
permit
matilda
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
rearing
of
my
children
excellent
creature
though
she
be
on
the
other
hand
he
would
not
have
been
unwilling
for
mary
to
mother
them
this
of
course
was
out
of
the
question
richard
had
accustomed
himself
to
trotty
but
would
thank
you
she
knew
for
any
fresh
encroachment
on
his
privacy
before
leaving
however
she
promised
to
sound
him
on
the
plan
of
placing
trotty
as
a
weekly
boarder
at
a
young
ladies
seminary
and
taking
the
infant
in
her
place
for
it
came
out
that
john
intended
to
set
zara
zara
but
newly
returned
from
a
second
voyage
to
england
and
still
sipping
like
a
bee
at
the
sweets
of
various
situations
at
the
head
of
his
house
once
more
and
mary
could
not
imagine
zara
rearing
a
baby
equally
hard
was
it
to
understand
john
not
having
learnt
wisdom
from
his
two
previous
failures
to
live
with
his
sister
but
in
seeking
tactfully
to
revive
his
memory
she
ran
up
against
such
an
ingrained
belief
in
the
superiority
of
his
own
kith
and
kin
that
she
was
baffled
and
could
only
fold
her
hands
and
hope
for
the
best
besides
jane
children
are
infinitely
more
tractable
than
poor
emma
was
john
parting
strange
thought
mary
how
attached
john
was
to
his
second
family
he
had
still
another
request
to
make
of
her
the
reports
he
received
of
the
boy
johnny
now
a
pupil
at
the
geelong
grammar
school
grew
worse
from
term
to
term
it
had
become
clear
to
him
that
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
possess
an
dullard
for
a
son
regretfully
giving
up
therefore
the
design
he
had
cherished
of
educating
johnny
for
the
law
he
had
resolved
to
waste
no
more
good
money
on
the
boy
but
to
take
him
once
he
was
turned
fifteen
into
his
own
business
young
john
however
had
proved
refractory
expressing
a
violent
antipathy
to
the
idea
of
it
is
here
that
i
should
be
glad
of
another
opinion
and
i
turn
to
you
mary
my
dear
jane
was
of
no
use
whatever
in
such
matters
none
whatever
being
and
very
properly
so
entirely
wrapped
up
in
her
own
children
so
mary
arranged
to
break
her
homeward
journey
at
geelong
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
and
summing
up
her
nephew
johnny
he
was
jack
at
school
but
that
of
course
his
tomfools
of
relations
could
be
expected
to
remember
johnny
was
waiting
on
the
platform
when
the
train
steamed
in
oh
what
a
bonny
boy
said
mary
to
herself
all
poor
emma
good
looks
johnny
had
been
kicking
his
heels
disconsolately
another
of
these
wretched
old
women
coming
down
to
jaw
him
he
wished
every
one
of
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
however
he
pulled
himself
together
and
went
forward
to
greet
his
aunt
he
was
not
in
the
least
bashful
and
as
they
left
the
station
he
took
stock
of
her
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
with
a
growing
approval
this
one
at
any
rate
he
need
feel
ashamed
of
and
she
was
not
so
dreadfully
old
after
all
perhaps
she
might
turn
out
quite
such
a
wet
blanket
as
the
rest
though
from
experience
he
could
connect
any
pleasure
with
relatives
visits
they
were
nasty
pills
that
had
to
be
swallowed
he
feared
and
disliked
his
father
aunt
zara
had
been
sheerly
ridiculous
with
her
frills
and
simpers
the
boys
had
imitated
her
for
weeks
after
and
once
most
shameful
of
all
his
stepmother
had
come
down
and
publicly
wept
over
him
his
cheeks
still
burnt
at
the
remembrance
and
he
had
been
glad
to
hear
that
she
was
dead
served
her
jolly
well
right
but
this
aunt
mary
seemed
a
horse
of
another
colour
and
he
did
not
sneak
her
into
town
by
a
back
way
as
he
had
planned
to
do
before
seeing
her
greatly
as
mary
might
admire
the
tall
fair
lad
by
her
side
she
found
herself
at
a
loss
how
to
deal
with
him
the
mind
of
a
schoolboy
of
thirteen
being
a
closed
book
to
her
johnny
looked
demure
and
answered
yes
aunt
mary
to
everything
she
said
but
this
was
of
small
assistance
in
getting
at
the
real
boy
inside
johnny
had
no
intention
in
the
beginning
of
taking
her
into
his
and
badly
bruised
confidence
however
a
happy
instinct
led
her
to
suggest
a
visit
to
a
shop
that
sold
and
gingerbeer
and
this
was
too
much
for
his
strength
of
mind
golly
did
he
have
a
and
a
whole
pound
of
to
take
back
with
him
to
school
it
was
over
the
snaps
with
an
moustache
drawn
round
his
fresh
young
mouth
the
underlip
of
which
swelled
like
a
ripe
cherry
that
he
blurted
out
i
say
aunt
mary
do
let
the
pater
stick
me
in
that
beastly
old
office
of
his
i
i
want
to
go
to
sea
oh
but
johnny
your
father
would
never
consent
to
that
i
sure
i
do
see
why
not
returned
the
boy
in
an
aggrieved
voice
i
hate
figures
and
father
knows
it
i
tell
you
i
mean
to
go
to
sea
and
as
he
said
it
his
lip
shot
out
and
suddenly
for
all
his
limpid
blue
eyes
and
flaxen
hair
it
was
his
father
face
that
confronted
mary
he
would
think
it
respectable
enough
dear
he
wants
you
to
rise
higher
in
the
world
and
to
make
money
you
must
remember
who
he
is
bosh
said
johnny
look
at
uncle
ned
and
uncle
jerry
and
the
governor
himself
he
did
have
to
sit
in
a
beastly
old
hole
of
an
office
when
he
was
my
age
that
was
quite
different
said
mary
weakly
and
as
for
your
uncle
jerry
johnny
why
afterwards
he
was
as
glad
as
could
be
to
get
into
an
office
at
all
well
i
sooner
be
hanged
retorted
young
john
but
the
next
minute
flinging
away
dull
care
he
inquired
briskly
can
you
play
tipcat
aunt
mary
and
vanquished
by
her
air
of
kindly
interest
he
gave
her
his
supreme
confidence
i
say
do
peach
will
you
but
i
got
a
white
rat
i
keep
it
in
a
locker
under
my
bed
a
nice
frank
handsome
boy
wrote
mary
do
be
too
hard
on
him
john
his
great
wish
is
to
travel
and
see
the
world
or
as
he
puts
it
to
go
to
sea
might
it
be
a
good
thing
to
humour
him
in
this
a
taste
of
the
hardships
of
life
would
soon
cure
him
of
any
such
fancies
stuff
and
nonsense
said
john
the
father
and
threw
the
letter
from
him
i
did
send
mary
there
to
let
the
young
devil
get
round
her
like
that
and
thereupon
he
wrote
to
the
headmaster
that
the
screw
was
to
be
applied
to
johnny
as
never
before
this
was
his
last
chance
if
it
failed
and
his
next
report
showed
no
improvement
he
would
be
taken
away
without
further
ado
and
planked
down
under
his
father
nose
no
son
of
his
should
go
to
sea
he
was
damned
if
they
should
for
like
many
another
who
has
yielded
to
the
wandering
passion
in
his
youth
john
had
small
mercy
on
it
when
it
reared
its
head
in
his
descendants
chapter
ix
henry
ocock
was
pressing
for
a
second
opinion
his
wife
had
been
in
poor
health
since
the
birth
of
her
last
child
mahony
drove
to
plevna
house
one
morning
between
nine
and
ten
a
thankless
task
lay
before
him
henry
case
had
been
a
fruitful
source
of
worry
to
him
and
he
now
saw
nothing
for
it
but
a
straight
talk
with
henry
himself
he
drove
past
what
had
once
been
the
great
swamp
from
a
bed
of
mud
interspersed
with
reedy
in
summer
a
dry
and
hollow
from
this
the
vast
natural
depression
had
been
transformed
into
a
graceful
lake
some
three
hundred
acres
in
extent
on
its
surface
pleasure
boats
lay
at
their
moorings
by
jetties
and
boatsheds
groups
of
swans
sailed
or
ducked
and
straddled
while
shady
walks
followed
the
banks
where
the
whiplike
branches
of
the
willows
showing
shoots
of
tenderest
green
trailed
in
the
water
or
swayed
like
loose
to
the
breeze
all
the
houses
that
had
sprung
up
round
lake
wendouree
had
spreading
grounds
but
ocock
outdid
the
rest
the
groom
opening
a
pair
of
decorative
iron
gates
which
were
the
showpiece
of
the
neighbourhood
mahony
turned
in
and
drove
past
exotic
firs
moreton
bay
and
araucarias
past
cherished
english
hollies
growing
side
by
side
with
giant
cacti
in
one
corner
stood
a
rockery
where
a
fountain
played
and
goldfish
swam
in
a
basin
the
house
itself
of
brick
and
with
massive
had
an
ornamental
verandah
on
one
side
the
was
a
medley
of
gilt
and
lustres
mirrors
and
glass
shades
the
finest
objects
from
dandaloo
had
been
brought
here
only
to
be
outdone
by
henry
own
additions
yes
ocock
lived
in
grand
style
nowadays
as
befitted
one
of
the
most
important
men
in
the
town
his
old
father
once
gone
and
mahony
alone
knew
why
the
latter
existence
acted
as
a
drag
he
would
no
doubt
stand
for
parliament
invited
to
walk
into
the
mahony
there
found
the
family
seated
at
table
it
was
a
charming
scene
behind
the
urn
henry
in
cap
and
morning
wrapper
dandled
her
infant
while
henry
in
oriental
gown
and
turkish
fez
had
laid
his
newspaper
by
to
ride
his
young
son
on
his
foot
mahony
refused
tea
or
coffee
but
could
not
avoid
drawing
up
a
chair
touching
the
peachy
cheeks
of
the
children
held
aloft
for
his
inspection
and
meeting
a
fire
of
playful
sallies
and
kindly
inquiries
as
he
did
so
he
was
sensitively
aware
that
it
fell
to
him
to
break
up
the
peace
of
this
household
only
he
knew
the
canker
that
had
begun
to
eat
at
its
roots
the
children
borne
off
henry
interrogated
her
husband
pleasure
with
a
pretty
may
i
or
should
i
lift
of
the
brows
and
gathering
that
he
wished
her
to
retire
laid
her
small
plump
hand
in
mahony
sent
a
graceful
message
to
dearest
mary
and
swept
the
folds
of
her
gown
from
the
room
henry
followed
her
with
a
eye
his
opinion
was
no
secret
that
in
figure
and
bearing
his
wife
bore
a
marked
resemblance
to
her
majesty
the
queen
and
admonished
her
not
to
fail
to
partake
of
some
light
refreshment
during
the
morning
in
the
shape
of
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
unless
my
love
you
prefer
me
to
order
cook
to
whip
you
up
an
mrs
ocock
is
i
regret
to
say
entirely
without
appetite
again
he
went
on
as
the
door
closed
behind
his
wife
what
she
eats
is
not
enough
to
keep
a
sparrow
going
you
must
prove
your
skill
doctor
and
oblige
us
by
prescribing
a
still
more
powerful
tonic
or
appetiser
the
last
had
no
effect
whatever
he
spoke
from
the
hearthrug
where
he
had
gone
to
warm
his
skirts
at
the
wood
fire
audibly
fingering
the
while
a
nest
of
sovereigns
in
a
waistcoat
pocket
i
feared
as
much
said
mahony
gravely
and
therewith
took
the
plunge
when
some
twenty
minutes
later
he
emerged
from
the
house
he
was
unaccompanied
and
himself
pulled
the
front
door
to
behind
him
he
stood
frowning
heavily
as
he
snapped
the
catches
of
his
gloves
and
fell
foul
of
the
groom
over
a
buckle
of
the
harness
in
a
fashion
that
left
the
man
blow
me
if
i
do
believe
he
got
the
sack
thought
the
man
in
driving
townwards
the
abrupt
stoppage
of
richard
visits
to
plevna
house
staggered
mary
and
since
she
could
get
nothing
out
of
her
husband
she
tied
on
her
bonnet
and
went
off
hotfoot
to
question
her
friend
but
henry
tearfully
declared
her
ignorance
she
had
listened
in
fear
and
trembling
to
the
sound
of
the
two
angry
voices
and
henry
was
adamant
they
had
already
called
in
another
doctor
mary
came
home
greatly
distressed
and
richard
still
wearing
his
obstinate
front
she
ended
by
losing
her
temper
he
knew
well
enough
said
she
it
was
not
her
way
to
interfere
or
to
be
inquisitive
about
his
patients
but
this
was
different
this
had
to
do
with
one
of
her
dearest
friends
she
must
know
in
her
ears
rang
agnes
words
henry
told
me
love
he
would
insult
me
by
repeating
what
your
husband
said
of
me
oh
mary
is
it
dreadful
and
when
i
liked
him
so
as
a
doctor
she
now
repeated
them
aloud
this
was
too
much
for
mahony
he
blazed
up
the
confounded
mischiefmonger
the
backbiter
well
if
you
will
have
it
wife
here
you
are
here
the
truth
what
i
said
to
ocock
was
i
said
my
good
man
if
you
want
your
wife
to
get
over
her
next
confinement
more
quickly
keep
the
out
of
her
reach
mary
gasped
and
sank
on
a
chair
letting
her
arms
flop
to
her
side
richard
she
ejaculated
oh
richard
you
never
did
i
did
indeed
my
oh
well
not
in
just
those
words
of
course
we
doctors
must
always
wrap
the
truth
up
in
silver
and
i
should
feel
it
my
duty
to
do
the
same
again
though
there
are
pleasanter
things
in
life
mary
i
can
assure
you
than
informing
a
low
mongrel
like
ocock
that
his
wife
is
drinking
on
the
sly
you
can
have
no
notion
my
dear
of
the
compliments
one
calls
down
on
one
head
by
so
doing
the
case
is
beyond
my
grasp
of
course
and
i
am
cloaking
my
own
shortcomings
by
making
scandalous
insinuations
against
a
delicate
lady
who
no
more
than
her
position
entitles
her
to
his
very
words
mary
the
purpose
of
keeping
up
her
strength
and
mahony
laughed
hotly
yes
but
was
it
i
mean
was
it
really
necessary
to
say
it
stammered
mary
still
at
sea
and
as
her
husband
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
i
ca
pretend
to
be
surprised
at
what
has
happened
richard
henry
will
never
forgive
you
he
thinks
so
much
of
everything
and
every
one
belonging
to
him
pray
can
i
help
that
help
his
infernal
pride
and
good
god
mary
ca
you
see
that
far
more
terrible
than
my
having
had
to
tell
him
the
truth
is
the
fact
of
there
being
such
a
truth
to
tell
oh
yes
indeed
i
can
and
the
warm
tears
rushed
to
mary
eyes
poor
poor
little
agnes
richard
it
comes
of
her
having
once
been
married
to
that
dreadful
man
and
though
she
does
say
so
yet
i
do
believe
she
really
happy
in
her
second
marriage
either
there
are
so
many
things
she
not
allowed
to
do
and
she
afraid
of
henry
i
know
she
is
you
see
he
displeased
when
she
dull
or
unwell
she
must
always
be
bright
and
look
pretty
and
i
expect
the
truth
is
since
her
illness
she
has
taken
to
taking
things
just
to
keep
her
spirits
up
here
mary
saw
a
ray
of
light
and
snatched
at
it
but
in
that
case
might
the
need
for
them
pass
as
she
grows
stronger
i
lay
no
claim
to
be
a
prophet
my
dear
for
it
does
seem
strange
that
i
never
noticed
anything
went
on
mary
more
to
herself
than
to
him
i
seen
agnes
at
all
hours
of
the
day
when
she
was
in
the
least
expecting
yes
richard
i
do
know
people
sometimes
eat
things
to
take
the
smell
away
but
the
idea
of
agnes
doing
anything
so
so
low
oh
is
it
just
possible
there
might
be
some
mistake
oh
well
if
you
going
to
imitate
ocock
and
try
to
teach
me
my
business
gave
back
mahony
with
an
angry
gesture
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
he
pulled
books
and
papers
to
him
as
if
such
a
thing
would
ever
occur
to
me
it
only
that
that
somehow
my
brain
wo
take
it
in
agnes
has
always
been
such
a
dear
good
little
soul
all
kindness
she
never
done
anybody
any
harm
or
said
a
hard
word
about
any
one
all
the
years
i
known
her
i
simply
ca
believe
it
of
her
and
that
the
truth
as
for
what
people
will
say
when
it
gets
about
that
you
been
shown
the
door
in
a
house
like
henry
why
i
afraid
even
to
think
of
it
and
powerless
any
longer
to
keep
back
her
tears
mary
hastened
from
the
room
but
she
also
thought
it
wiser
to
get
away
before
richard
had
time
to
frame
the
request
that
she
should
break
off
all
intercourse
with
plevna
house
this
she
could
never
promise
to
do
and
the
result
might
be
a
quarrel
whereas
if
she
avoided
giving
her
word
she
would
be
free
to
slip
out
now
and
then
to
see
poor
agnes
when
richard
was
on
his
rounds
and
henry
at
business
but
this
was
the
only
point
clear
to
her
in
standing
up
for
her
friend
she
had
been
perfectly
sincere
to
think
ill
of
a
person
she
cared
for
cost
mary
an
inward
struggle
against
this
however
she
had
an
antipathy
to
set
that
was
almost
stronger
than
herself
of
all
forms
of
vice
intemperance
was
the
one
she
hated
most
she
lived
in
a
country
where
it
was
alas
only
too
common
but
she
had
never
learnt
to
tolerate
it
or
to
look
with
a
lenient
eye
on
those
who
succumbed
and
whether
these
were
but
slaves
of
the
nipping
habit
or
the
eternal
who
felt
fit
for
nothing
if
they
had
not
a
peg
inside
them
or
those
seasoned
topers
who
drank
their
companions
under
the
table
without
themselves
turning
a
hair
or
yet
again
those
who
sober
for
three
parts
of
the
year
spent
the
fourth
in
secret
debauches
herself
she
had
remained
as
rigidly
abstemious
as
in
the
days
of
her
girlhood
and
she
often
mused
with
a
glow
at
her
heart
on
her
great
good
fortune
in
having
found
in
richard
one
whose
views
on
this
subject
were
no
less
strict
than
her
own
hence
her
distress
at
his
disclosure
was
caused
not
alone
by
the
threatened
loss
of
a
friendship
she
wept
for
the
horror
with
which
the
knowledge
filled
her
little
by
little
though
her
mind
worked
round
to
what
was
after
all
the
chief
consideration
richard
action
and
its
probable
consequences
and
here
once
more
she
was
divided
against
herself
for
a
moment
she
had
hoped
her
husband
would
own
the
chance
of
him
being
in
error
but
she
soon
saw
that
this
would
never
do
a
mistake
on
his
part
would
be
a
blow
to
his
reputation
besides
making
enemies
of
people
like
the
henrys
for
nothing
if
he
had
to
lose
them
as
patients
it
might
as
well
be
for
a
good
solid
reason
she
told
herself
with
a
dash
of
his
own
asperity
no
it
was
a
case
of
either
husband
or
friend
and
though
she
pitied
agnes
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
yet
there
were
literally
no
lengths
she
would
have
shrunk
from
going
to
to
spare
richard
pain
or
even
anxiety
and
this
led
her
on
to
wonder
whether
granted
things
were
as
he
said
he
had
approached
henry
in
the
most
discreet
way
could
he
not
have
avoided
a
complete
break
she
sat
and
pondered
this
question
till
her
head
ached
finding
herself
up
against
the
irreconcilability
of
the
practical
with
the
ideal
which
complicates
a
man
working
life
what
she
belatedly
tried
to
think
out
for
her
husband
was
some
little
stratagem
by
means
of
which
he
could
have
salved
his
conscience
without
giving
offence
he
might
have
said
that
the
drugs
he
was
prescribing
would
be
nullified
by
the
use
of
wine
or
spirits
even
better
have
warned
agnes
in
private
somehow
it
might
surely
have
been
managed
henry
had
no
doubt
been
extremely
rude
and
overbearing
but
in
earlier
years
richard
had
known
how
to
behave
towards
she
could
tell
why
but
he
was
finding
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
on
with
people
nowadays
he
certainly
had
a
very
great
deal
to
do
and
was
often
tired
out
again
he
did
not
need
to
care
so
much
as
formerly
whether
he
offended
people
or
not
ordinary
patients
that
was
the
henrys
of
course
were
of
the
utmost
consequence
still
once
on
a
time
he
had
been
noted
for
his
tact
it
was
sad
to
see
it
leaving
him
in
the
lurch
several
times
of
late
she
had
been
forced
to
step
in
and
smooth
out
awkwardnesses
but
a
week
ago
he
had
had
poor
little
amelia
grindle
up
in
arms
by
telling
her
that
her
sickly
would
mentally
never
be
quite
like
other
children
to
every
one
else
this
had
been
plain
from
the
outset
but
amelia
had
suspected
nothing
having
poor
thing
no
idea
when
a
babe
ought
to
begin
to
take
notice
or
cut
its
teeth
richard
said
it
was
better
for
her
to
face
the
truth
betimes
than
to
spend
her
life
vainly
hoping
and
fretting
indeed
it
would
not
be
right
of
him
to
allow
it
poor
dear
richard
he
set
such
store
by
truth
and
principle
and
she
mary
would
not
have
had
him
otherwise
all
the
same
she
thought
that
in
both
cases
a
small
compromise
would
not
have
hurt
him
but
compromise
he
would
not
or
could
not
and
as
recalled
to
reality
by
the
sight
of
the
week
washing
which
strained
ballooned
collapsed
on
its
lines
in
the
yard
biddy
was
again
letting
the
clothes
get
much
too
dry
as
mary
rose
to
her
feet
she
manfully
squared
her
shoulders
to
meet
the
weight
of
the
new
burden
that
was
being
laid
on
them
with
regard
to
mahony
it
might
be
supposed
that
having
faithfully
done
what
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
he
would
enjoy
the
fruits
of
a
quiet
mind
this
was
not
so
before
many
hours
had
passed
he
was
wrestling
with
the
incident
anew
and
a
true
son
of
that
nation
which
for
all
its
spends
its
best
strength
in
fighting
shadows
he
felt
a
great
deal
angrier
in
retrospect
than
he
had
done
at
the
moment
it
was
not
alone
the
fact
of
him
having
got
his
conge
no
medico
was
safe
from
that
punch
below
the
belt
his
bitterness
was
aimed
at
himself
once
more
he
had
let
himself
be
hoodwinked
had
written
down
the
smooth
civility
it
pleased
ocock
to
adopt
towards
him
to
respect
and
esteem
now
that
the
veil
was
torn
he
saw
how
poor
the
opinion
of
him
actually
was
and
always
had
been
for
a
memory
was
struggling
to
emerge
in
him
setting
strings
in
vibration
and
suddenly
there
rose
before
him
a
picture
of
ocock
that
time
had
dimmed
he
saw
the
latter
standing
in
the
dark
crowded
lobby
of
the
cursing
at
him
for
letting
their
witness
escape
there
it
was
there
in
these
two
scenes
far
apart
as
they
lay
you
had
the
whole
man
the
unctuous
blandness
the
sleek
courtesy
was
but
a
mask
which
he
wore
for
you
just
so
long
as
you
did
not
hinder
him
by
getting
in
his
way
that
was
the
unpardonable
sin
for
ocock
was
out
to
succeed
to
succeed
at
any
price
and
by
any
means
in
tracing
his
course
no
goal
but
this
had
ever
stood
before
him
the
obligations
that
bore
on
your
ordinary
mortal
a
sense
of
honesty
of
responsibility
to
one
fellows
the
soft
pull
of
domestic
ties
did
not
trouble
ocock
he
laughed
them
down
or
wrung
their
necks
like
so
many
pullets
and
should
the
poor
little
woman
who
bore
his
name
become
a
drag
on
him
she
would
be
tossed
on
to
the
with
the
rest
in
a
way
so
complete
a
freedom
from
altruistic
motives
had
something
grandiose
about
it
but
those
who
ran
up
against
it
and
could
not
fight
it
with
its
own
weapons
had
not
an
earthly
chance
thus
mahony
sat
in
judgment
giving
rein
for
once
to
his
ingrained
dislike
for
the
man
of
whom
he
had
now
made
an
enemy
in
whose
debt
for
the
rest
he
stood
deep
and
had
done
ever
since
the
day
he
had
been
fool
enough
like
the
fly
in
the
nursery
rhyme
to
seek
out
ocock
and
his
familiars
in
their
grimy
little
parlour
in
chancery
lane
but
his
first
heat
spent
he
soon
cooled
down
and
was
able
to
laugh
at
the
stagy
explosiveness
of
his
attitude
so
much
for
the
personal
side
of
the
matter
looked
at
from
a
business
angle
it
was
more
serious
the
fact
of
him
having
been
shown
the
door
by
a
patient
of
ocock
standing
was
bound
as
mary
saw
to
react
unfavourably
on
the
rest
of
the
practice
the
news
would
run
like
wildfire
through
the
place
never
were
such
hotbeds
of
gossip
as
these
colonial
towns
besides
the
colleague
who
had
been
called
in
to
agnes
in
his
stead
was
none
too
well
disposed
towards
him
his
fears
were
justified
it
quickly
got
about
that
he
had
made
a
blunder
all
henry
needed
said
the
was
change
of
air
and
scene
and
forthwith
the
lady
was
packed
off
on
a
trial
trip
to
sydney
mahony
held
his
head
high
and
refused
to
notice
looks
and
hints
but
he
knew
all
about
what
went
on
behind
his
back
he
was
morbidly
sensitive
to
atmosphere
could
tell
how
a
house
was
charged
as
soon
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
people
were
saying
a
mistake
there
why
not
here
too
slow
recoveries
asked
themselves
if
a
fresh
treatment
might
not
benefit
them
lovers
of
blue
pills
hungered
for
more
drastic
remedies
the
disaffection
would
blow
over
of
course
but
it
was
painful
while
it
lasted
and
things
were
not
bettered
by
one
of
his
patients
choosing
just
this
inconvenient
moment
to
die
an
elderly
man
down
with
the
russian
influenza
who
disobeyed
orders
got
up
too
early
and
was
carried
off
by
double
pneumonia
inside
a
worry
over
the
mishap
robbed
his
poor
medical
attendant
of
sleep
for
several
nights
on
end
not
that
this
was
surprising
he
found
it
much
harder
than
of
old
to
keep
his
mind
from
running
on
his
patients
outside
in
his
younger
days
he
had
laid
down
fixed
rules
on
this
score
every
brainworker
he
held
must
in
his
spare
time
be
able
to
detach
his
thoughts
from
his
chief
business
pin
them
to
something
of
quite
another
kind
no
matter
how
trivial
keep
fowls
or
root
round
gardens
play
the
flute
or
go
in
for
carpentry
now
he
might
have
dug
till
his
palms
blistered
it
would
not
help
those
he
prescribed
for
teased
him
like
a
pack
of
which
clamour
to
be
heard
and
if
a
serious
case
took
a
turn
for
the
worse
he
would
find
himself
rising
in
a
sweat
of
uncertainty
and
going
lamp
in
hand
into
the
surgery
to
con
over
a
prescription
he
had
written
during
the
day
and
one
knew
where
that
kind
of
thing
led
now
as
if
all
this
were
not
enough
there
was
added
to
it
the
old
evergreen
botheration
about
money
chapter
x
thus
far
ocock
had
nursed
his
mining
investments
for
him
with
a
fatherly
care
he
himself
had
been
free
as
a
bird
from
responsibility
every
now
and
again
he
would
drop
in
at
the
office
just
to
make
sure
the
lawyer
was
on
the
alert
and
each
time
he
came
home
cheerful
with
confidence
that
was
over
now
as
a
first
result
of
the
breach
he
missed
or
so
he
believed
clearing
four
hundred
pounds
among
the
shares
he
held
was
one
lot
which
till
now
had
proved
a
sorry
bargain
soon
after
purchase
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
management
of
the
claim
there
had
been
a
lawsuit
followed
by
calls
unending
and
never
a
dividend
now
when
these
shares
unexpectedly
swung
up
to
a
high
level
only
to
drop
the
week
after
to
their
standing
figure
ocock
failed
to
sell
out
in
the
nick
of
time
called
to
account
he
replied
that
it
was
customary
in
these
matters
for
his
clients
to
advise
him
thus
deepening
mahony
sense
of
obligation
stabbed
in
his
touchiness
he
wrote
for
all
his
scrip
to
be
handed
over
to
him
and
thereafter
loss
and
gain
depended
on
himself
alone
it
certainly
brought
a
new
element
of
variety
into
his
life
the
mischief
was
he
could
get
to
his
study
of
the
only
with
a
fagged
brain
and
the
fear
lest
he
should
do
something
rash
or
let
a
lucky
chance
slip
kept
him
on
it
was
about
this
time
that
mary
seated
one
evening
in
face
of
her
husband
found
herself
reflecting
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
how
seldom
richard
ever
smiles
nowadays
for
a
wonder
they
were
at
a
soiree
together
at
the
house
of
one
of
mahony
colleagues
the
company
consisted
of
the
inner
circle
of
friends
and
acquaintances
always
the
same
people
the
old
job
lot
one
knows
before
they
open
their
mouths
what
they
say
and
how
they
say
it
richard
had
grumbled
as
he
dressed
the
henry
ococks
were
not
there
though
it
being
common
knowledge
that
the
two
men
declined
to
meet
and
a
dash
of
fresh
blood
was
present
in
the
shape
of
a
lady
and
gentleman
just
out
from
home
richard
got
into
talk
with
this
couple
and
mary
watching
him
fondly
could
not
but
be
struck
by
his
animation
his
eyes
lit
up
he
laughed
and
chatted
made
merry
repartee
she
was
carried
back
to
the
time
when
she
had
known
him
first
in
those
days
his
natural
gravity
was
often
cut
through
by
a
mood
of
high
spirits
of
boyish
jollity
which
if
only
by
way
of
contrast
rendered
him
a
delightful
companion
she
grew
a
little
wistful
as
she
sat
comparing
present
with
past
and
loath
though
she
was
to
dig
deep
for
fear
of
stirring
up
uncomfortable
things
she
could
not
escape
the
discovery
that
in
spite
of
all
his
success
and
his
career
there
had
surpassed
their
dearest
hopes
in
spite
of
the
natural
gifts
fortune
had
showered
on
him
richard
was
not
what
you
would
call
a
happy
man
no
nor
even
moderately
happy
why
this
should
be
it
went
beyond
her
to
say
he
had
everything
he
could
wish
for
yes
everything
except
perhaps
a
little
more
time
to
himself
and
better
health
he
was
not
as
strong
as
she
would
have
liked
to
see
him
nothing
radically
wrong
of
course
but
enough
to
fidget
him
might
not
this
this
he
himself
called
it
want
of
tone
be
a
reason
for
the
scant
pleasure
he
got
out
of
life
and
i
think
i
pop
down
and
see
munce
about
him
one
morning
without
a
word
to
him
was
how
she
eased
her
mind
and
wound
up
her
reverie
but
daylight
and
the
most
prosaic
hours
of
the
made
the
plan
look
absurd
once
alive
though
to
his
condition
she
felt
deeply
sorry
for
him
in
his
patent
inability
ever
to
be
content
it
was
a
thousand
pities
things
might
have
run
so
smoothly
for
him
he
have
got
so
much
satisfaction
out
of
them
if
only
he
could
have
braced
himself
to
regard
life
in
cheerier
fashion
but
at
this
mary
stopped
and
wondered
and
wondered
was
that
really
true
positively
her
experiences
of
late
led
her
to
believe
that
richard
would
be
less
happy
still
if
he
had
nothing
to
be
unhappy
but
dear
me
this
was
getting
out
of
her
depth
altogether
she
shook
her
head
and
rebuked
herself
for
growing
fanciful
all
the
same
her
new
glimpse
of
his
inmost
nature
made
her
doubly
tender
of
thwarting
him
hence
she
did
not
set
her
face
as
firmly
as
she
might
otherwise
have
done
against
a
wild
plan
he
now
formed
of
again
altering
or
indeed
rebuilding
the
house
although
she
could
scarcely
think
of
it
with
patience
she
liked
her
house
so
well
as
it
stood
and
it
was
amply
big
enough
there
was
only
the
pair
of
them
and
john
child
it
had
the
name
she
knew
of
being
one
of
the
most
comfortable
and
in
ballarat
brick
for
solidity
where
wood
prevailed
with
a
wide
snowy
verandah
up
the
posts
of
which
rare
creepers
ran
twining
their
tendrils
one
with
another
to
form
a
screen
against
the
sun
now
what
must
richard
do
but
uproot
the
creepers
and
pull
down
the
verandah
thus
baring
the
walls
to
the
fierce
summer
heat
plaster
over
the
brick
and
more
outlandish
still
add
a
top
storey
when
she
came
back
from
melbourne
where
she
had
gone
to
escape
the
upset
richard
ordinarily
so
sensitive
had
managed
to
endure
it
quite
well
thus
proving
that
he
could
put
up
with
discomfort
if
he
wanted
to
when
she
saw
it
again
mary
hardly
recognised
her
home
personally
she
thought
it
ugly
for
all
its
grandeur
changed
wholly
for
the
worse
nor
did
time
ever
reconcile
her
to
the
upper
storey
domestic
worries
bred
from
it
the
servant
went
off
in
a
huff
because
of
the
stairs
they
were
at
once
obliged
to
double
their
staff
to
cap
it
all
with
its
flat
front
unbroken
by
bay
or
porch
the
house
looked
like
no
other
in
the
town
now
instead
of
passing
admiring
remarks
people
stood
before
the
gate
to
laugh
at
its
droll
appearance
yet
she
would
gladly
have
made
the
best
of
this
had
richard
been
the
happier
for
it
he
was
not
or
only
for
the
briefest
of
intervals
then
his
restlessness
broke
out
afresh
there
came
days
when
nothing
suited
him
not
his
fine
consulting
room
or
the
improved
furnishings
of
the
house
or
even
her
cookery
of
which
he
had
once
been
so
fond
he
grew
dainty
to
a
degree
she
searched
her
for
piquant
recipes
next
he
fell
to
imagining
it
was
unhealthy
to
sleep
on
feathers
and
went
to
the
expense
of
having
a
hard
horsehair
mattress
made
to
fit
the
bed
accustomed
to
the
softest
down
he
naturally
tossed
and
turned
all
night
long
and
rose
in
the
morning
declaring
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
beaten
with
sticks
the
mattress
was
stowed
away
in
a
behind
the
kitchen
and
there
it
remained
it
was
not
alone
mary
sometimes
stood
and
considered
with
a
rueful
eye
the
many
discarded
objects
that
bore
it
company
richard
oddly
enough
he
was
ever
able
to
poke
fun
at
himself
had
christened
this
outhouse
the
cemetery
of
dead
fads
here
was
a
set
of
indian
clubs
he
had
been
going
to
harden
his
muscles
with
every
morning
and
had
used
for
a
week
together
with
an
gymnastic
apparatus
bought
for
the
same
purpose
here
stood
a
patent
that
was
to
have
dashed
energy
over
him
after
a
bad
night
and
had
only
succeeded
in
giving
him
acute
neuralgia
a
he
had
broken
his
back
at
for
a
couple
of
days
a
homoeopathic
and
a
phrenological
head
both
subjects
he
had
meant
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
by
looking
into
had
time
not
failed
him
mary
sighed
when
she
thought
of
the
waste
of
good
money
these
and
similar
articles
stood
for
some
day
he
would
just
have
them
privately
carted
away
to
auction
but
if
richard
set
his
heart
on
a
thing
he
wanted
it
so
badly
so
much
more
than
other
people
did
that
he
knew
no
peace
till
he
had
it
mahony
read
in
his
wife
eyes
the
disapproval
she
was
too
wise
to
utter
at
any
other
time
her
silent
criticism
would
have
galled
him
in
this
case
he
took
shelter
behind
it
let
her
only
go
on
setting
him
down
for
lax
and
spendthrift
incapable
of
knowing
his
own
mind
he
would
be
sorry
indeed
for
her
to
guess
how
matters
really
stood
with
him
the
truth
was
he
had
fallen
a
prey
to
utter
despondency
was
become
so
spiritless
that
it
puzzled
even
himself
he
thought
he
could
trace
some
of
the
mischief
back
to
the
professional
knocks
and
jars
ocock
action
had
brought
down
on
him
to
hear
one
opinion
doubted
one
skill
questioned
was
the
tyro
portion
he
was
too
old
to
treat
such
insolence
with
the
scorn
it
deserved
of
course
he
had
lived
the
affair
down
but
the
result
of
it
would
seem
to
be
a
bottomless
ennui
a
tedium
vitae
that
had
something
pathological
about
it
under
its
influence
the
homeliest
trifles
swelled
to
feats
beyond
his
strength
there
was
for
instance
the
putting
on
and
off
one
clothing
this
infinite
boredom
of
straps
and
buttons
and
all
for
what
for
a
day
that
would
be
an
exact
copy
of
the
one
that
had
gone
before
a
night
as
unrefreshing
as
the
last
did
any
one
suspect
that
there
were
moments
when
he
quailed
before
this
job
suspect
that
more
than
once
he
had
even
reckoned
the
number
of
times
he
would
be
called
on
to
perform
it
day
in
day
out
till
that
garment
was
put
on
him
that
came
off
no
more
or
that
he
could
understand
and
feel
sympathy
with
those
faint
souls
and
there
were
such
who
laid
hands
on
themselves
rather
than
go
on
doing
it
did
this
get
abroad
he
would
be
considered
ripe
for
bedlam
physician
heal
thyself
he
swallowed
doses
of
a
tonic
preparation
and
put
himself
on
a
fatty
diet
thereafter
he
tried
to
take
a
philosophic
view
of
his
case
he
had
now
he
told
himself
reached
an
age
when
such
a
state
of
mind
gave
cause
neither
for
astonishment
nor
alarm
how
often
had
it
not
fallen
to
him
in
his
role
of
medical
adviser
to
reassure
a
patient
on
this
score
the
arrival
of
middle
age
brought
about
a
certain
lowness
of
spirits
in
even
the
most
robust
along
with
a
more
or
less
marked
bodily
languor
went
an
uneasy
sense
of
coming
loss
the
time
was
at
hand
to
bid
farewell
to
much
that
had
hitherto
made
life
agreeable
and
for
most
this
was
a
bitter
pill
meanwhile
one
held
a
kind
of
mental
stocktaking
as
often
as
not
by
the
light
of
a
complete
disillusionment
of
the
many
glorious
things
one
had
hoped
to
do
or
to
be
nothing
was
accomplished
the
great
realisation
in
youth
breathlessly
chased
but
never
grasped
was
now
seen
to
be
a
which
could
wear
a
thousand
forms
but
invariably
turned
to
air
as
one
came
up
with
it
in
nine
instances
out
of
ten
there
was
nothing
to
put
in
its
place
and
you
began
to
ask
yourself
in
a
kind
of
horrific
amaze
can
this
be
all
this
for
this
the
pother
of
growth
the
struggles
and
the
sufferings
the
soul
climacteric
if
you
would
from
which
a
mortal
came
forth
dulled
to
resignation
or
greedy
for
the
few
physical
pleasures
left
him
or
prone
to
that
tragic
clinging
to
youth
skirts
which
made
the
later
years
of
many
women
and
not
a
few
men
ridiculous
in
each
case
the
motive
power
was
the
same
the
haunting
fear
that
one
had
squeezed
life
dry
worse
still
that
it
had
not
been
worth
the
squeezing
thus
his
reason
but
like
a
tongue
of
flame
his
instinct
leapt
up
to
give
combat
by
the
gods
this
cap
did
not
fit
him
squeezed
life
try
found
it
not
worth
while
why
he
had
never
got
within
measurable
distance
of
what
he
called
life
at
all
there
could
be
no
question
of
him
resigning
himself
deep
down
in
him
he
knew
was
an
enormous
residue
of
vitality
of
untouched
mental
energy
that
only
waited
to
be
drawn
on
it
was
like
a
buried
treasure
jealously
kept
for
the
event
of
his
one
day
catching
up
with
life
not
the
bare
scramble
for
a
living
that
here
went
by
that
name
but
life
with
a
capital
l
the
existence
he
had
once
confidently
counted
on
as
his
a
tourney
of
spiritual
adventuring
of
intellectual
excitement
in
which
the
prize
striven
for
was
not
money
or
anything
to
do
with
money
far
away
thousands
of
miles
off
luckier
men
than
he
were
in
the
thick
of
it
he
of
his
own
free
will
had
cut
himself
adrift
and
now
it
was
too
late
but
was
it
had
the
time
irretrievably
gone
by
the
ancient
idea
of
escape
long
dormant
suddenly
reawoke
in
him
with
a
new
force
and
once
stirring
it
was
not
to
be
silenced
but
went
on
sounding
like
a
through
all
he
did
at
first
he
shut
his
ears
to
it
to
dally
with
side
issues
for
example
he
worried
the
question
why
the
should
only
now
have
been
reached
and
not
six
months
a
year
ago
it
was
quibbling
to
lay
the
whole
blame
on
ocock
shoulders
the
real
cause
went
deeper
was
of
older
growth
and
driving
his
mind
back
over
the
past
he
believed
he
could
pin
his
present
loss
of
grip
to
that
fatal
day
on
which
he
learnt
that
his
best
friend
had
betrayed
him
things
like
that
gave
you
a
crack
that
would
not
mend
he
had
been
rendered
suspicious
where
he
had
once
been
credulous
prone
to
see
evil
where
no
evil
was
for
deceived
by
purdy
in
whom
could
he
trust
of
a
surety
not
in
the
pushful
set
of
jobbers
and
tricksters
he
was
condemned
to
live
amongst
no
discoveries
he
might
make
about
them
would
surprise
and
once
more
the
old
impotent
anger
with
himself
broke
forth
that
he
should
ever
have
let
himself
take
root
in
such
detestable
surroundings
why
not
shake
the
dust
of
the
country
off
his
feet
from
this
direct
attack
he
recoiled
casting
up
his
hands
as
if
against
the
evil
eye
what
next
but
exclaim
as
he
might
now
that
the
idea
had
put
on
words
it
was
by
no
means
so
simple
to
fend
it
off
as
when
it
had
been
a
mere
vague
humming
at
the
back
of
his
mind
it
seized
him
swept
his
brain
bare
of
other
thoughts
he
began
to
look
worn
and
never
more
so
than
when
he
imagined
himself
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
asking
approval
of
his
scheme
he
could
picture
her
face
when
she
heard
that
he
planned
throwing
up
his
fine
position
and
decamping
on
nothing
a
year
the
vision
was
a
cold
douche
to
his
folly
no
no
it
would
not
do
you
could
not
accustom
a
woman
to
ease
and
luxury
and
then
when
you
felt
you
had
had
enough
and
would
welcome
a
return
to
spartan
simplicity
to
an
austere
clarity
of
living
expect
her
to
be
prepared
at
the
word
to
step
back
into
poverty
one
was
bound
bound
and
by
just
those
silken
threads
which
in
premarital
days
had
seemed
sheerly
desirable
he
wondered
now
what
it
would
be
like
to
stand
free
as
the
wind
answerable
only
to
himself
the
bare
thought
of
it
filled
him
as
with
the
rushing
of
wings
once
he
had
been
within
an
ace
of
cutting
and
running
that
was
in
the
early
days
soon
after
his
marriage
trade
had
petered
out
and
there
would
have
been
as
little
to
leave
behind
as
to
carry
with
him
but
even
so
circumstances
had
proved
too
strong
for
him
what
with
persuasions
and
john
intermeddling
his
scheme
had
come
to
nothing
and
if
with
so
much
in
his
favour
he
had
not
managed
to
carry
it
out
how
in
all
the
world
could
he
hope
to
now
when
every
thing
conspired
against
him
it
was
besides
excusable
in
youth
to
challenge
fortune
a
very
different
matter
for
one
of
his
age
of
his
age
the
words
gave
him
pause
by
their
light
he
saw
why
he
had
knuckled
under
so
meekly
at
the
time
of
his
first
attempt
it
was
because
then
a
few
years
one
way
or
another
did
not
signify
he
had
them
to
spare
now
each
individual
year
was
precious
to
him
he
parted
with
it
lingeringly
unwillingly
time
had
taken
to
flashing
past
too
christmas
was
hardly
celebrated
before
it
was
again
at
the
door
another
ten
years
or
so
and
he
would
be
an
old
man
and
it
would
in
very
truth
be
too
late
the
tempter
voice
in
this
case
also
the
voice
of
reason
said
now
or
never
but
when
he
came
to
look
the
facts
in
the
face
his
heart
failed
him
anew
so
heavily
did
the
arguments
against
his
taking
such
a
step
and
true
to
his
race
it
was
these
he
began
by
marshalling
weigh
down
the
scales
he
should
have
done
it
if
done
it
was
to
be
five
three
even
a
couple
of
years
ago
each
day
that
dawned
added
to
the
tangle
made
the
idea
seem
more
preposterous
local
dignities
had
been
showered
on
him
he
sat
on
the
committees
of
the
district
hospital
and
the
benevolent
asylum
was
honorary
medical
officer
to
this
society
and
that
a
trustee
of
the
church
one
of
the
original
founders
of
the
mechanics
institute
of
the
botanical
society
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
his
practice
was
second
to
none
his
rarely
shewed
a
blank
space
people
drove
in
from
miles
round
to
consult
him
in
addition
he
had
an
extremely
popular
wife
a
good
house
and
garden
horses
and
traps
and
a
sure
yearly
income
of
some
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
of
what
stuff
was
he
made
that
he
could
lightly
contemplate
turning
his
back
on
prizes
such
as
these
even
as
he
told
them
off
however
the
old
sense
of
hollowness
was
upon
him
again
his
life
there
reminded
him
of
a
gaudy
let
down
before
an
empty
stage
a
painted
sham
with
darkness
and
vacuity
behind
at
bottom
none
of
these
distinctions
and
successes
meant
anything
to
him
not
a
scrap
of
mental
pabulum
could
be
got
from
them
rather
would
he
have
chosen
to
be
poor
and
a
nobody
among
people
whose
thoughts
flew
to
meet
his
and
there
was
also
another
side
to
it
stingy
though
the
years
had
been
of
intellectual
grist
they
had
not
scrupled
to
rob
him
of
many
an
essential
by
which
he
set
store
his
old
faculty
for
good
or
evil
of
swift
decision
for
instance
it
was
lost
to
him
now
as
witness
his
present
miserable
vacillation
it
had
gone
off
with
his
health
physically
he
was
but
a
ghost
of
the
man
he
had
once
been
but
the
bitterest
grudge
he
bore
the
life
was
for
the
shipwreck
it
had
made
of
his
early
ideals
he
remembered
the
pure
joy
the
lofty
sentiments
with
which
he
had
returned
to
medicine
bah
there
had
been
no
room
for
any
sentimental
nonsense
of
that
kind
here
he
had
long
since
ceased
to
follow
his
profession
disinterestedly
the
years
had
made
a
hack
of
him
a
skilled
hack
of
course
but
just
a
hack
he
had
had
no
time
for
study
all
his
strength
had
gone
in
keeping
his
income
up
to
a
certain
figure
lest
the
wife
should
be
less
well
dressed
and
equipped
than
her
neighbours
or
patients
fight
shy
of
him
or
his
confreres
wag
their
oh
he
had
adapted
himself
supremely
well
to
the
standards
of
this
australia
felix
and
he
must
not
complain
if
in
so
doing
he
had
been
stripped
not
only
of
his
rosy
dreams
but
also
of
that
spiritual
force
on
which
he
could
once
have
drawn
at
will
like
a
fool
he
had
believed
it
possible
to
serve
mammon
with
impunity
and
for
as
long
as
it
suited
him
he
knew
better
now
at
this
moment
he
was
undergoing
the
sensations
of
one
who
having
taken
shelter
in
what
he
thinks
a
light
and
flimsy
structure
finds
that
it
is
built
of
the
solidest
stone
worse
still
that
he
has
been
walled
up
inside
and
even
suppose
he
could
pull
himself
together
for
the
effort
required
how
justify
his
action
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
his
motives
would
be
to
the
crew
around
him
nor
would
any
go
to
the
trouble
of
trying
to
understand
there
was
john
all
john
would
see
was
an
elderly
and
not
man
deliberately
throwing
away
the
fruits
of
toil
and
for
what
for
the
privilege
of
in
some
remote
spot
as
a
stranger
and
unknown
having
his
way
to
make
all
over
again
of
being
free
to
shoulder
once
more
the
risks
and
hazards
the
undertaking
involved
and
little
though
he
cared
for
john
or
any
one
else
opinion
mahony
could
not
help
feeling
a
trifle
sore
in
advance
at
the
ridicule
of
which
he
might
be
the
object
at
the
zanyish
figure
he
was
going
to
be
obliged
to
cut
but
a
fig
for
what
people
thought
of
him
once
away
from
here
he
would
he
thanked
god
never
see
any
of
them
again
no
it
was
mary
who
was
the
real
the
opponent
he
most
feared
had
he
been
less
attached
to
her
the
thing
would
have
been
easier
as
it
was
he
shrank
from
hurting
her
and
hurt
and
confuse
her
he
must
he
knew
mary
as
well
nay
better
than
he
knew
his
own
unreckonable
self
for
mary
was
not
a
creature
of
moods
did
not
change
her
mental
envelope
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
just
his
precise
knowledge
of
her
told
him
that
he
would
never
get
her
to
see
eye
to
eye
with
him
her
clear
serene
outlook
was
attuned
to
the
plain
and
the
practical
she
would
discover
a
thousand
drawbacks
to
his
scheme
but
nary
a
one
of
the
incorporeal
benefits
he
dreamed
of
reaping
from
it
there
was
his
handling
of
money
for
one
thing
she
had
come
he
was
aware
to
regard
him
as
incurably
extravagant
and
it
would
be
no
easy
task
to
convince
her
that
he
could
learn
again
to
fit
his
expenses
to
a
light
purse
she
had
a
instinctive
distrust
too
of
leaving
the
beaten
track
another
point
made
him
still
more
dubious
mary
whole
heart
and
happiness
were
bound
up
in
this
place
where
she
had
spent
the
of
her
life
who
knew
if
she
would
thrive
as
well
on
other
soil
he
found
it
intolerable
to
think
that
she
might
have
to
pay
for
his
want
of
yes
reduced
to
its
essentials
it
came
to
mean
the
pitting
of
one
soul
welfare
against
that
of
another
was
a
between
his
happiness
and
hers
one
of
them
would
have
to
yield
who
would
suffer
more
by
doing
so
he
or
she
he
believed
that
a
sacrifice
on
his
part
would
make
the
wreck
of
his
life
complete
on
hers
well
thanks
to
her
doughty
habit
of
finding
good
everywhere
there
was
a
chance
of
her
coming
out
unscathed
here
was
his
case
in
a
nutshell
still
he
did
not
tackle
mary
for
sometimes
after
all
a
disturbed
doubt
crept
upon
him
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
go
on
as
he
was
instead
of
as
she
would
drastically
word
it
cutting
his
throat
with
his
own
hand
and
to
be
perfectly
honest
he
believed
it
would
he
could
now
afford
to
pay
for
help
in
his
work
to
buy
what
books
he
needed
or
fancied
to
take
holidays
while
putting
in
a
locum
even
to
keep
on
the
locum
at
a
good
salary
while
he
journeyed
overseas
to
visit
the
land
of
his
birth
but
at
this
another
side
of
him
what
he
thought
of
as
spirit
in
contradistinction
to
soul
cried
out
in
alarm
fearful
lest
it
was
again
to
be
betrayed
thus
far
though
by
rights
coequal
in
the
house
of
the
body
it
had
been
rigidly
kept
down
nevertheless
it
had
persisted
like
a
bright
cold
little
spark
at
dead
of
night
his
restlessness
the
spiritual
malaise
that
encumbered
him
had
been
its
mute
form
of
protest
did
he
go
on
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
its
warnings
he
might
do
himself
irreparable
harm
for
time
was
flying
the
sum
of
his
years
mounting
shrinking
that
roomy
future
to
which
he
had
thus
far
always
postponed
what
seemed
too
difficult
for
the
moment
now
he
saw
that
he
dared
delay
no
longer
in
setting
free
the
imprisoned
elements
in
him
was
he
ever
to
grow
to
that
complete
whole
which
each
mortal
aspires
to
that
a
change
of
environment
would
work
this
miracle
he
did
not
doubt
a
congenial
environment
was
meat
and
drink
to
him
was
light
and
air
here
in
this
country
he
had
remained
as
utterly
alien
as
any
jew
of
old
who
wept
by
the
rivers
of
babylon
and
like
a
tune
there
came
floating
into
his
mind
words
he
had
lit
on
somewhere
or
learnt
on
the
horace
he
thought
but
whatever
their
source
words
that
fitted
his
case
to
a
nicety
coelum
non
animum
mutant
qui
trans
mare
currunt
non
animum
ah
could
he
but
have
foreseen
this
foreknown
it
if
not
before
he
set
sail
on
what
was
to
have
been
but
a
swift
adventure
then
at
least
on
that
fateful
day
long
past
when
foiled
by
mary
pleadings
and
his
own
inertia
he
had
let
himself
be
bound
anew
thus
the
summer
dragged
by
a
summer
to
try
the
toughest
mahony
thought
he
had
never
gone
through
its
like
for
heat
and
discomfort
the
drought
would
not
break
and
on
the
great
round
ballarat
and
to
the
north
the
sheep
dropped
like
flies
at
an
early
frost
the
forest
reservoirs
dried
up
displaying
the
red
mud
of
their
bottoms
and
a
bath
became
a
luxury
or
a
penance
the
scanty
water
running
thick
and
red
then
the
bush
caught
fire
and
burnt
for
three
days
painting
the
sky
a
rusty
brown
and
making
the
air
hard
to
breathe
of
a
morning
his
first
act
on
going
into
his
surgery
was
to
pick
up
the
thermometer
that
stood
on
the
table
sure
as
fate
though
the
clock
had
not
long
struck
nine
the
mercury
marked
something
between
a
hundred
and
a
hundred
and
five
degrees
he
let
it
fall
with
a
nerveless
gesture
since
his
sunstroke
he
not
only
hated
he
feared
the
sun
but
out
into
it
he
must
to
drive
through
so
opaque
that
one
could
only
draw
rein
till
they
subsided
meanwhile
holloaing
off
collisions
under
the
close
leather
hood
he
sat
and
stifled
or
removing
his
green
goggles
for
the
fiftieth
time
climbed
down
to
enter
yet
another
baked
wooden
house
where
he
handled
prostrate
bodies
rank
with
sweat
or
prescribed
for
pallid
or
children
then
home
to
toy
with
the
food
set
before
him
his
mind
already
running
on
the
discomforts
of
the
two
bits
of
came
his
way
this
summer
old
ocock
fell
in
dismounting
from
a
vehicle
and
sustained
a
compound
fracture
of
the
femur
owing
to
his
advanced
age
there
was
for
a
time
fear
of
malunion
of
the
parts
and
this
kept
mahony
on
the
rack
secondly
a
near
neighbour
a
common
little
fellow
who
kept
a
jeweller
shop
in
bridge
street
actually
took
the
plunge
sold
off
one
fine
day
and
sailed
for
home
and
this
seemed
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
but
the
accident
that
gave
the
to
his
scruples
was
another
on
the
advice
of
a
wealthy
publican
he
was
treating
whose
judgment
he
trusted
mahony
had
invested
heavily
for
him
selling
off
other
stock
to
do
it
in
a
company
known
as
the
hodderburn
estate
this
was
a
government
affair
and
ought
to
have
been
beyond
reproach
one
day
however
it
was
found
that
the
official
reports
of
the
work
done
by
the
diamond
were
cooked
documents
and
instantly
every
one
connected
with
the
mine
directors
managers
engineers
lay
under
the
suspicion
of
fraudulent
dealings
shares
had
risen
as
high
as
ten
pounds
odd
but
when
the
drive
reached
the
bore
and
in
place
of
the
deep
the
public
had
been
led
to
expect
hard
rock
was
found
overhead
there
was
a
panic
shares
dropped
to
shillings
and
did
not
rally
mahony
was
a
loser
by
six
hundred
pounds
and
got
besides
a
moral
shaking
from
which
he
could
not
recover
he
sat
and
bit
his
nail
to
the
quick
was
he
he
savagely
asked
himself
going
to
linger
on
until
the
little
he
had
managed
to
save
was
snatched
from
him
he
dashed
off
a
letter
to
john
asking
his
to
recommend
a
reliable
broker
and
this
done
he
got
up
to
look
for
mary
determined
to
come
to
grips
with
her
at
last
chapter
xi
how
to
begin
how
reduce
to
a
few
plain
words
his
subtle
tangle
of
thought
and
feeling
was
the
problem
he
did
not
find
his
wife
on
her
usual
seat
in
the
arbour
in
searching
for
her
upstairs
and
down
he
came
to
a
rapid
decision
he
would
lay
chief
stress
on
his
poor
state
of
health
i
feel
i
killing
myself
i
ca
go
on
but
richard
dear
ejaculated
mary
and
paused
in
her
sewing
her
needle
uplifted
a
bead
balanced
on
its
tip
richard
had
run
her
to
earth
in
the
spare
bedroom
to
which
at
this
time
she
often
repaired
for
he
objected
to
the
piece
of
work
she
had
on
hand
that
of
covering
yards
of
black
cashmere
with
minute
jet
beads
vowing
that
she
would
ruin
her
eyesight
over
it
so
having
set
her
heart
on
a
fashionable
polonaise
she
was
careful
to
keep
out
of
his
way
i
not
a
young
man
any
longer
wife
when
one
past
forty
poor
mother
used
to
say
was
a
man
prime
of
life
not
for
me
and
not
here
in
this
hole
oh
dear
me
i
do
wonder
why
you
have
such
a
down
on
ballarat
i
sure
there
must
be
many
worse
places
in
the
world
to
live
in
and
lowering
her
needle
mary
brought
the
bead
to
its
appointed
spot
of
course
you
have
a
lot
to
do
i
know
and
being
such
a
poor
sleeper
does
improve
matters
but
she
was
considering
her
pattern
sideways
as
she
spoke
thinking
more
of
it
than
of
what
she
said
every
one
had
to
work
hard
out
here
compared
with
some
she
could
name
richard
job
of
driving
round
in
a
springy
buggy
seemed
ease
itself
besides
i
told
you
at
the
time
you
were
wrong
not
to
take
a
holiday
in
winter
when
you
had
the
chance
you
need
a
thorough
change
every
year
to
set
you
up
you
came
back
from
the
last
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
the
only
change
that
will
benefit
me
is
one
for
good
and
all
said
mahony
with
extreme
gloom
he
had
thrown
up
the
and
stretched
himself
on
the
bed
where
he
lay
with
his
hands
clasped
under
his
neck
tutored
by
experience
mary
did
not
contradict
him
and
it
the
kind
i
finally
made
up
my
mind
to
take
richard
how
you
do
run
on
and
mary
still
gently
incredulous
but
a
thought
wider
awake
let
her
work
sink
to
her
lap
what
is
the
use
of
talking
like
that
believe
it
or
not
my
dear
as
you
choose
you
see
that
all
at
her
further
exclamations
of
doubt
and
amazement
mahony
patience
slipped
its
leash
surely
to
goodness
my
health
comes
first
before
any
confounded
practice
ssh
baby
and
do
get
cross
richard
you
can
hardly
expect
me
not
to
be
surprised
when
you
spring
a
thing
of
this
sort
on
me
you
never
even
dropped
a
hint
of
it
before
because
i
knew
very
well
what
it
would
be
you
dead
against
it
of
course
now
i
call
that
unjust
you
barely
let
me
get
a
word
in
edgeways
oh
i
know
by
heart
everything
you
going
to
say
it
nonsense
folly
madness
and
so
on
all
the
phrases
you
women
fish
up
from
your
vocabulary
when
you
want
to
stave
off
a
change
hinder
any
alteration
of
the
status
quo
but
i
tell
you
this
wife
you
bury
me
here
if
i
do
get
away
soon
i
not
much
more
than
skin
and
bone
as
it
is
and
i
confess
if
i
got
to
be
buried
i
rather
lie
elsewhere
have
good
english
earth
atop
of
me
had
mary
been
a
man
she
might
have
retorted
that
this
was
a
very
woman
way
of
shifting
ground
she
bit
her
lip
and
did
not
answer
immediately
then
you
know
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
even
in
fun
besides
you
always
say
much
more
than
you
mean
dear
very
well
then
if
you
prefer
it
wait
and
see
you
be
sorry
some
day
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
richard
you
in
earnest
when
you
talk
of
selling
off
your
practice
and
going
to
england
i
can
buy
another
there
ca
i
with
these
words
he
leapt
to
his
feet
afire
with
animation
and
while
mary
now
thoroughly
uneasy
was
folding
up
her
work
he
dilated
upon
the
benefits
that
would
accrue
to
them
from
the
change
to
dust
and
sun
and
drought
to
blistering
hot
winds
and
papier
mache
walls
they
would
make
their
new
home
in
some
substantial
old
stone
house
that
had
weathered
half
a
century
or
more
tangled
over
with
creepers
folded
away
in
its
own
privacy
as
only
an
english
house
could
be
in
the
roses
would
trail
over
arch
and
pergola
there
would
be
a
lawn
with
shaped
yews
on
it
while
in
the
orchard
old
would
flaunt
their
red
abundance
above
grey
lichened
walls
as
if
there
were
apples
enough
here
thought
mary
he
got
a
frog
in
his
throat
as
he
went
on
to
paint
in
greater
detail
for
her
who
had
left
it
so
young
the
intimate
charm
of
the
home
country
the
rich
green
dimpled
countryside
and
not
till
now
did
he
grasp
how
sorely
he
had
missed
it
oh
believe
me
to
talk
of
home
is
no
mere
figure
of
speech
mary
in
fancy
he
trod
winding
lanes
that
ran
between
giant
hedges
hedges
in
tender
bud
with
dew
on
them
or
snowed
over
with
white
mayflowers
or
behung
with
the
fairy
webs
and
gossamer
of
early
autumn
thick
as
twine
beneath
their
load
of
moisture
he
followed
white
roads
that
were
banked
with
primroses
and
ran
headlong
down
to
the
sea
he
climbed
the
shoulder
of
a
down
on
a
spring
morning
when
the
air
was
alive
with
larks
carolling
but
chiefly
it
was
the
greenness
that
called
to
him
the
greenness
of
the
greenest
country
in
the
world
viewed
from
this
distance
the
homeland
looked
to
him
like
one
vast
meadow
oh
to
tread
its
grass
again
not
what
one
knew
as
grass
here
a
poor
annual
that
lasted
for
a
few
brief
weeks
but
lush
a
foot
high
or
shaven
emerald
lawns
on
which
ancient
trees
spread
their
shade
or
the
rank
growth
in
old
orchards
starry
with
wild
flowers
on
which
fluttered
down
he
longed
too
for
the
exquisite
finishedness
of
the
mother
country
the
soft
tints
of
northern
skies
his
eyes
ached
his
brows
had
grown
wrinkled
from
gazing
on
iron
roofs
set
against
the
hard
blue
overhead
on
dirty
weatherboards
innocent
of
paint
on
backyards
and
ramshackle
fences
on
the
straggling
landscape
with
its
untidy
trees
all
the
unrelieved
ugliness
in
short
of
the
colonial
scene
he
stopped
only
for
want
of
breath
mary
was
silent
he
waited
still
she
did
not
speak
he
fell
to
earth
with
a
bump
and
was
angry
come
out
with
it
i
suppose
all
this
seems
to
you
just
the
raving
of
a
lunatic
oh
richard
no
but
a
little
well
a
little
unpractical
i
never
heard
before
of
any
one
throwing
up
a
good
income
because
he
like
the
scenery
it
a
step
that
needs
the
greatest
consideration
good
god
do
you
think
i
have
considered
it
and
from
every
angle
there
is
an
argument
for
or
against
that
i
have
gone
over
a
thousand
and
one
times
and
with
never
a
word
to
me
richard
mary
was
hurt
and
showed
it
it
really
is
hardly
fair
for
this
is
my
home
as
well
as
but
now
listen
you
tired
out
run
down
with
the
heat
and
that
last
attack
of
dysentery
take
a
good
holiday
stay
away
for
three
months
if
you
like
sail
over
to
hobart
town
or
up
to
sydney
you
so
fond
of
the
water
and
when
you
come
back
strong
and
well
we
talk
about
all
this
again
i
sure
by
then
you
see
things
with
other
eyes
and
who
to
look
after
the
practice
pray
why
a
locum
tenens
of
course
or
engage
an
assistant
aha
you
agree
to
that
now
would
you
i
remember
how
opposed
you
were
once
to
the
idea
well
if
i
have
to
choose
between
it
and
you
giving
up
altogether
now
for
your
own
sake
richard
do
go
and
do
anything
rash
if
once
you
sell
off
and
leave
ballarat
you
can
never
come
back
and
then
if
you
regret
it
where
will
you
be
that
why
i
say
do
hurry
to
decide
sleep
over
it
or
let
us
consult
somebody
john
perhaps
no
you
do
madam
no
you
do
cried
richard
with
a
grim
dash
of
humour
you
had
me
once
crippled
me
handcuffed
me
you
and
your
john
between
you
it
sha
happen
again
i
crippled
you
i
richard
why
never
in
my
life
have
i
done
anything
but
what
i
thought
was
for
your
good
i
always
put
you
first
and
mary
eyes
filled
with
tears
yes
where
it
a
question
of
one
material
welfare
you
have
your
equal
i
admit
that
but
the
other
side
of
me
needs
coddling
too
yes
and
sympathy
but
it
can
whistle
for
such
a
thing
as
far
as
concerned
mary
sighed
i
think
you
do
realise
dear
how
difficult
it
sometimes
is
to
understand
you
or
to
make
out
what
you
really
do
want
she
said
slowly
her
tone
struck
at
his
heart
indeed
and
i
do
he
cried
contritely
i
a
born
old
grumbler
mavourneen
i
know
contrariness
in
person
but
in
this
case
come
love
do
try
to
grasp
what
i
after
it
means
so
much
to
me
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
to
beseech
her
unhesitatingly
she
laid
hers
in
it
i
am
trying
richard
though
you
may
believe
it
i
always
do
and
even
if
i
sometimes
ca
manage
it
well
you
know
dear
you
generally
get
your
own
way
in
the
end
think
of
the
house
i
still
not
clear
why
you
altered
it
i
liked
it
much
better
as
it
was
but
i
did
make
any
fuss
did
i
though
i
should
have
if
i
thought
we
were
only
to
occupy
it
for
a
single
year
after
still
that
was
a
trifle
compared
with
what
you
want
to
do
now
though
i
lived
to
a
hundred
i
should
never
be
able
to
approve
of
this
and
you
do
know
how
hard
it
is
to
consent
to
a
thing
one
disapproves
of
you
could
do
it
yourself
oh
what
was
the
use
richard
of
toiling
as
you
have
if
now
just
when
you
can
afford
to
charge
higher
fees
and
the
practice
is
beginning
to
bring
in
money
mahony
let
her
hand
drop
even
giving
it
a
slight
push
from
him
and
turned
to
pace
the
floor
anew
oh
money
money
money
i
sick
of
the
very
sound
of
the
word
but
you
talk
as
if
nothing
else
mattered
ca
you
for
once
wife
see
through
the
letter
of
the
thing
to
the
spirit
behind
i
admit
the
practice
has
brought
in
a
tidy
income
of
late
but
as
for
the
rest
of
the
splendours
they
exist
my
dear
only
in
your
imagination
if
you
ask
me
i
say
i
lead
a
dog
life
why
even
a
navvy
works
only
for
a
fixed
number
of
hours
per
diem
my
days
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
look
at
yesterday
out
in
the
blazing
sun
from
morning
till
night
i
did
get
back
from
the
second
round
till
nine
at
ten
a
confinement
that
keeps
me
up
till
three
from
three
till
dawn
i
toss
and
turn
far
too
weary
to
sleep
by
the
time
six
struck
you
of
course
were
slumbering
sweetly
i
was
in
hell
with
tic
at
seven
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
got
up
for
the
chloroform
bottle
an
hour
rest
at
any
price
else
how
face
the
crowd
in
the
and
you
call
that
splendour
luxurious
ease
if
so
my
dear
words
have
not
the
same
meaning
any
more
for
you
and
me
mary
did
not
point
out
that
she
had
said
nothing
of
the
kind
or
that
he
had
set
up
an
extreme
case
as
typical
she
tightened
her
lips
her
big
eyes
were
very
solemn
and
it
not
the
work
alone
richard
was
declaring
it
the
place
wife
the
people
i
done
with
mary
utterly
done
upon
my
word
if
i
thought
i
had
to
go
on
living
among
them
even
for
another
twelvemonth
but
people
are
the
same
all
the
world
over
the
protest
broke
from
her
in
spite
of
herself
no
by
god
they
not
and
here
richard
launched
out
into
a
diatribe
against
his
this
sordid
these
hard
mean
grasping
that
made
mary
stand
aghast
what
could
be
the
matter
with
him
what
was
he
thinking
of
he
who
was
ordinarily
so
generous
had
he
forgotten
the
many
kindnesses
shown
him
the
warm
gratitude
of
his
patients
people
sympathy
at
the
time
of
his
illness
but
he
went
on
my
demands
are
most
modest
all
i
ask
is
to
live
among
human
beings
with
whom
i
have
half
an
idea
in
common
men
who
sometimes
raise
their
noses
from
the
ground
instead
of
eternally
scheming
how
to
line
their
pockets
reckoning
human
progress
solely
in
terms
of
no
i
sacrificed
enough
of
my
life
to
this
country
i
mean
to
have
the
rest
for
myself
and
there
another
thing
my
dear
another
bad
habit
this
precious
place
breeds
in
us
it
begins
by
making
us
indifferent
to
those
who
belong
to
us
but
are
out
of
our
sight
and
ends
by
cutting
our
closest
ties
i
do
mean
by
distance
alone
i
have
an
old
mother
still
living
mary
whose
chief
prayer
is
that
she
may
see
me
once
again
before
she
dies
i
was
her
the
child
her
arms
kept
the
shape
of
what
am
i
to
her
now
what
does
she
know
of
me
of
the
hard
tired
man
i
have
become
and
you
are
in
much
the
same
box
my
dear
unless
forgotten
by
now
that
you
ever
had
a
mother
mary
was
scandalised
forget
one
mother
richard
i
think
trying
what
dreadful
things
you
can
find
to
say
when
i
write
home
every
three
months
and
provoked
by
this
fresh
piece
of
unreason
she
opened
fire
in
earnest
in
defence
of
what
she
believed
to
be
their
true
welfare
richard
listened
to
her
without
interrupting
even
seemed
to
grant
the
truth
of
what
she
said
but
none
the
less
even
as
she
pleaded
with
him
a
numbing
sense
of
futility
crept
over
her
she
stuttered
halted
and
finally
fell
silent
her
words
were
like
so
many
lassos
thrown
after
his
vagrant
soul
and
this
was
out
of
reach
it
had
sniffed
freedom
it
was
free
ran
wild
already
on
the
boundless
plains
of
liberty
after
he
had
gone
from
the
room
she
sat
with
idle
hands
she
was
all
in
a
daze
richard
was
about
to
commit
an
folly
and
she
was
powerless
to
hinder
it
if
only
she
had
had
some
one
she
could
have
talked
things
over
with
taken
advice
of
but
no
it
went
against
the
grain
in
her
to
discuss
her
husband
actions
with
a
third
person
purdy
had
been
the
sole
exception
and
purdy
had
become
impossible
looking
back
she
marvelled
at
her
own
dullness
in
not
that
something
like
this
might
happen
what
more
natural
than
that
the
multitude
of
little
whims
and
fads
richard
had
indulged
should
culminate
in
a
big
whim
of
this
kind
but
the
acknowledgment
caused
her
fresh
anxiety
she
had
watched
him
tire
like
a
fickle
child
of
first
one
thing
then
another
was
it
likely
that
he
would
now
suddenly
prove
more
stable
she
did
not
think
so
for
she
attributed
his
present
mood
of
pettish
aversion
wholly
to
the
fact
of
his
being
run
down
in
health
it
was
quite
true
he
had
not
been
himself
of
late
but
here
again
he
was
so
fanciful
that
you
never
knew
how
literally
to
take
his
ailments
half
the
time
she
believed
he
just
imagined
their
existence
and
the
long
holiday
she
had
urged
on
him
would
have
been
enough
to
sweep
the
cobwebs
from
his
brain
oh
if
only
he
could
have
held
on
in
patience
four
or
five
years
hence
at
most
he
might
have
considered
retiring
from
general
practice
she
almost
wept
as
she
remembered
how
they
had
once
planned
to
live
for
that
day
now
it
was
all
to
end
in
smoke
then
her
mind
reverted
to
herself
and
to
what
the
break
would
mean
to
her
and
her
little
world
rocked
to
its
foundations
for
no
clear
call
went
out
to
mary
from
her
native
land
she
docilely
said
home
with
the
rest
and
kept
her
family
ties
intact
but
she
had
never
expected
to
go
back
except
on
a
flying
visit
she
thought
of
england
rather
vaguely
as
a
country
where
it
was
always
raining
and
where
according
to
john
an
assemblage
of
old
fogies
known
as
the
house
of
commons
persistently
intermeddled
in
the
affairs
of
the
colony
for
more
than
half
her
life
and
the
half
that
truly
counted
australia
had
been
her
home
her
home
in
fancy
she
made
a
round
of
the
house
viewing
each
cosy
room
lingering
fondly
over
the
contents
of
cupboards
and
presses
recollecting
how
she
had
added
this
piece
of
furniture
for
sake
that
for
ornament
till
the
whole
was
as
perfect
as
she
knew
how
to
make
it
now
everything
she
loved
and
valued
the
piano
the
chandelier
the
gilt
cornices
the
horsehair
would
fall
under
the
auctioneer
hammer
go
to
deck
out
the
houses
of
other
people
richard
said
she
could
buy
better
and
handsomer
things
in
england
but
mary
allowed
herself
no
illusions
on
this
score
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
she
had
learnt
by
personal
experience
what
slow
work
building
up
a
practice
was
it
would
be
years
and
years
before
they
could
hope
for
another
such
home
and
sore
and
sorry
as
she
might
feel
at
having
to
relinquish
her
pretty
things
in
richard
case
it
would
mean
a
good
deal
more
than
that
to
him
the
loss
of
them
would
be
a
real
misfortune
so
used
had
he
grown
to
luxury
and
comfort
so
strongly
did
the
need
of
it
run
in
his
blood
worse
still
was
the
prospect
of
parting
from
relatives
and
friends
the
tears
came
at
this
freely
john
children
who
would
watch
over
them
when
she
was
gone
how
could
she
from
so
far
away
keep
the
promise
she
had
made
to
poor
jinny
on
her
she
would
have
to
give
up
the
baby
of
which
she
had
grown
so
fond
give
it
back
into
unmotherly
hands
and
never
again
of
a
saturday
would
she
fetch
poor
little
trotty
from
school
she
must
say
to
one
and
to
all
to
john
and
zara
and
jerry
and
would
know
no
more
at
close
quarters
how
they
fared
when
jerry
married
there
would
be
no
one
to
see
to
it
that
he
chose
the
right
girl
then
ned
and
polly
poor
souls
poor
souls
what
with
the
rapid
increase
of
their
family
and
unsteadiness
he
could
not
keep
any
job
long
because
of
it
they
only
just
contrived
to
make
ends
meet
how
they
would
do
it
when
she
was
not
there
to
lend
a
helping
hand
she
could
not
imagine
and
outside
her
brothers
and
sisters
there
was
good
devine
mary
had
engaged
to
guide
her
friend
tottery
steps
on
the
slippery
path
of
melbourne
society
did
devine
enter
the
ministry
and
poor
little
agnes
with
her
terrible
weakness
and
amelia
and
her
sickly
babes
and
tilly
dear
good
tilly
never
again
would
the
pair
of
them
enjoy
one
of
their
jolly
laughs
or
cook
for
a
picnic
or
drive
out
to
a
mushroom
hunt
no
the
children
would
grow
up
anyhow
her
brothers
forget
her
in
carving
out
their
own
lives
her
friends
find
other
friends
for
some
time
however
she
kept
her
own
counsel
but
when
she
had
tried
by
hook
and
by
crook
to
bring
richard
to
reason
and
failed
when
she
saw
that
he
was
actually
beginning
on
the
quiet
to
make
ready
for
departure
and
that
the
day
was
coming
on
which
every
one
would
have
to
know
then
she
threw
off
her
reserve
she
was
spending
the
afternoon
with
tilly
they
sat
on
the
verandah
together
john
child
fat
playing
after
the
manner
of
two
short
years
at
their
feet
at
the
news
that
was
broken
to
her
tilly
began
by
laughing
immoderately
believing
that
mary
was
taking
a
rise
out
of
her
but
having
studied
her
friend
face
she
let
her
work
fall
slowly
opened
mouth
and
eyes
and
was
at
first
unequal
to
uttering
a
word
thereafter
she
bombarded
mary
with
questions
wants
to
leave
ballarat
to
go
home
to
england
she
echoed
with
an
emphasis
such
as
tilly
alone
could
lay
well
of
all
the
what
for
what
on
earth
for
somebody
gone
and
left
a
fortune
or
been
appointed
to
the
queen
what
is
it
mary
what
up
what
indeed
this
was
the
question
mary
dreaded
and
one
that
would
leap
to
every
tongue
why
was
he
going
she
sat
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
it
was
not
in
her
to
wound
people
feelings
by
blurting
out
the
truth
this
would
also
put
richard
in
a
bad
light
and
did
she
give
no
reason
at
all
many
would
think
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
weakly
in
a
very
fashion
she
mumbled
that
his
health
was
not
what
it
should
be
and
he
had
got
it
into
his
head
that
for
this
the
climate
of
the
colony
was
to
blame
nothing
would
do
him
but
to
return
to
england
i
never
no
never
in
my
born
days
did
i
hear
tell
of
such
a
thing
and
tilly
exploding
brought
her
closed
fist
heavily
down
on
her
knee
mary
for
a
mere
maggot
like
that
to
chuck
up
a
practice
such
as
got
upon
my
word
my
dear
it
looks
as
if
was
touched
and
she
significantly
tapped
her
forehead
ha
now
i
understand
you
know
i
seen
quite
well
love
you
been
looking
a
bit
down
in
the
mouth
of
late
and
so
pa
noticed
it
too
after
you
gone
the
other
day
said
to
me
does
the
little
lady
nowadays
as
if
she
got
something
on
mind
and
i
to
him
is
it
enough
that
she
got
to
put
up
with
the
cranks
and
crotchets
of
one
o
your
sect
oh
mary
my
dear
there
many
a
true
word
said
in
jest
though
little
did
i
think
what
the
crotchet
would
be
and
slowly
the
rims
of
tilly
eyes
and
the
tip
of
her
nose
reddened
and
swelled
no
i
ca
picture
it
mary
what
be
like
without
you
she
said
and
pulling
out
her
handkerchief
blew
snort
after
snort
which
was
tilly
way
nowadays
of
having
a
good
cry
there
there
baby
auntie
only
got
the
for
just
think
of
it
mary
except
that
first
year
or
so
after
you
were
married
we
been
together
you
and
me
pretty
much
ever
since
you
came
to
us
that
time
at
the
a
little
black
midget
of
a
thing
in
short
frocks
i
can
still
remember
jinn
and
i
laughed
at
the
idea
of
you
teaching
us
and
poor
ma
said
to
wait
and
make
sure
we
were
laughing
on
the
wrong
side
of
our
mouths
and
ma
was
right
as
usual
for
if
ever
a
clever
little
kid
trod
the
earth
it
was
you
mary
the
cleverness
i
knew
very
little
more
than
you
yourselves
no
it
was
you
who
were
all
so
kind
to
me
i
had
been
feeling
so
lonely
as
if
nobody
wanted
me
and
i
shall
never
forget
how
mother
put
her
arms
round
me
and
cuddled
me
and
how
safe
and
comfortable
i
felt
it
was
always
just
like
home
there
to
me
and
why
not
i
like
to
know
look
mary
i
going
to
ask
you
something
plump
and
plain
you
really
been
happy
in
your
marriage
my
dear
or
you
not
you
such
a
loyal
little
soul
i
know
you
never
show
it
if
you
were
and
sometimes
i
my
doubts
about
you
mary
for
you
and
the
doctor
are
just
as
different
as
chalk
and
cheese
of
course
i
have
as
happy
as
the
day
long
cried
mary
sensitive
as
ever
to
a
reflection
on
her
husband
you
must
think
anything
like
that
tilly
i
could
imagine
myself
married
to
anyone
but
richard
then
that
only
makes
it
harder
for
you
now
poor
thing
pulled
two
ways
like
as
you
are
said
tilly
and
trumpeted
afresh
all
the
same
there
is
anything
i
stick
at
mary
to
keep
you
here
be
offended
my
dear
but
it
does
matter
half
so
much
about
the
doctor
going
as
you
there
none
cleverer
than
of
course
in
own
line
but
never
fitted
in
properly
here
i
do
want
to
exactly
say
thinks
too
good
for
us
but
there
is
something
mary
love
and
i
not
the
only
one
who
felt
it
i
known
people
go
on
like
anything
about
behind
back
nothing
would
induce
them
to
have
and
haughty
airs
inside
their
doors
again
etcetera
mary
flushed
yes
i
know
people
do
sometimes
judge
richard
very
unkindly
for
at
heart
he
the
most
modest
of
men
it
only
his
manner
and
he
ca
help
that
can
he
there
are
those
who
say
a
doctor
ought
to
be
able
to
my
but
never
mind
him
oh
it
you
i
feel
for
mary
being
dragged
off
like
this
ca
you
do
anything
dear
put
your
foot
down
mary
shook
her
head
it
no
use
richard
is
so
well
so
queer
in
some
ways
tilly
besides
you
know
i
do
think
it
would
be
right
of
me
to
really
pit
my
will
against
his
poor
little
you
oh
men
are
queer
fish
mary
are
they
not
that
i
can
complain
i
drew
a
prize
in
the
when
i
took
that
old
jawkins
in
there
but
when
i
look
round
me
or
think
back
and
see
what
we
women
put
up
with
there
was
poor
old
ma
she
to
be
man
for
both
and
jinn
mary
who
did
dare
to
call
soul
own
and
milady
agnes
is
travelling
the
selfsame
road
why
she
to
cock
eye
at
henry
nowadays
before
she
trusts
to
say
whether
beef
or
mutton
she
eating
and
now
you
love
carted
off
with
never
a
or
just
because
the
tired
of
it
and
thinks
like
a
change
there
no
question
of
whether
you
tired
or
not
oh
my
no
but
he
has
to
earn
the
money
tilly
it
is
quite
fair
to
put
it
that
way
protested
her
friend
well
i
do
know
mary
i
sure
and
tilly
plump
person
rose
and
sank
in
a
prodigious
sigh
but
if
i
was
wife
would
get
off
so
easy
i
know
that
it
makes
me
just
boil
mary
answered
with
a
rueful
smile
she
could
never
be
angry
with
richard
in
cold
blood
or
for
long
together
as
time
went
on
though
and
the
of
her
home
began
by
the
auctioneer
man
appearing
to
paw
over
and
appraise
the
furniture
a
certain
dull
resentment
did
sometimes
come
uppermost
under
its
sway
she
had
forcibly
to
remind
herself
what
a
good
husband
richard
had
always
been
had
to
tell
off
his
qualities
one
by
one
instead
of
taking
them
as
hitherto
for
granted
no
her
quarrel
she
began
to
see
was
not
so
much
with
him
as
with
the
powers
above
why
should
her
husband
alone
not
be
as
robust
and
hardy
as
all
the
other
husbands
in
the
place
none
of
their
healths
threatened
to
fail
nor
did
any
of
them
find
the
conditions
of
the
life
intolerable
that
was
another
shabby
trick
fate
had
played
richard
in
not
endowing
him
with
worldly
wisdom
and
a
healthy
itch
to
succeed
instead
of
that
he
had
been
blessed
with
ideas
and
impulses
that
stood
directly
in
his
and
it
was
here
that
mary
bore
more
than
one
of
her
private
ambitions
for
him
to
its
grave
a
new
expression
came
into
her
eyes
too
an
unsure
baffled
look
life
was
not
after
all
going
to
be
the
simple
straightforward
affair
she
had
believed
thus
far
save
for
the
one
unhappy
business
with
purdy
wrongs
and
complications
had
passed
her
by
now
she
saw
that
no
more
than
anyone
else
could
she
hope
to
escape
them
out
of
this
frame
of
mind
she
wrote
a
long
confidential
letter
to
john
john
must
not
be
left
in
ignorance
of
what
hung
over
her
it
was
also
a
relief
to
unbosom
herself
to
one
of
her
own
family
and
john
was
good
enough
to
travel
up
expressly
to
talk
things
over
with
her
and
as
he
put
it
to
call
richard
to
order
like
every
one
else
he
showed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
at
the
latter
flimsy
reasons
for
seeking
a
change
but
when
in
spite
of
her
warning
he
bearded
his
with
a
jocose
and
hearty
come
come
my
dear
mahony
what
all
this
you
actually
thinking
of
giving
us
the
slip
richard
took
his
interference
so
badly
became
so
agitated
over
the
head
of
the
harmless
question
that
john
airy
remonstrance
died
in
his
throat
mad
as
a
march
hare
was
his
private
verdict
as
he
shook
down
his
ruffled
plumes
to
mary
he
said
ponderously
well
upon
my
soul
my
dear
girl
i
do
know
i
am
frankly
at
a
loss
what
to
say
measured
by
every
practical
standard
the
step
he
contemplates
is
little
short
of
suicidal
i
fear
he
will
live
to
regret
it
and
mary
who
had
not
expected
anything
from
john
intervention
and
also
knew
the
grounds
for
richard
heat
mary
now
resigned
herself
with
the
best
grace
she
could
muster
to
the
inevitable
chapter
xii
house
and
practice
sold
for
a
good
round
sum
the
brass
plates
were
removed
from
gate
and
door
leaving
dirty
squares
flanked
by
carpets
came
up
and
curtains
down
and
like
rats
from
a
doomed
ship
men
and
women
servants
fled
to
other
situations
one
fine
day
the
auctioneer
bell
was
rung
through
the
main
streets
of
the
town
and
both
on
this
and
the
next
when
the
red
flag
flew
in
front
of
the
house
a
troop
of
intending
purchasers
together
with
an
even
larger
number
of
the
merely
curious
streamed
in
at
the
gate
and
overran
the
premises
at
noon
the
auctioneer
mounted
his
perch
gathered
the
crowd
round
him
and
soon
had
the
sale
in
full
swing
catching
or
wheedling
and
insisting
with
when
persuasion
could
do
no
more
his
monotonous
of
going
going
gone
it
would
have
been
in
bad
taste
for
either
husband
or
wife
to
be
visible
while
the
auction
was
in
progress
and
the
night
before
mary
and
the
child
had
moved
to
tilly
where
they
would
stay
for
the
rest
of
the
time
but
mahony
was
still
hard
at
work
the
job
of
winding
up
and
getting
in
the
money
owed
him
was
no
light
one
for
the
report
had
somehow
got
abroad
that
he
was
retiring
from
practice
because
he
had
made
his
fortune
and
only
too
many
people
took
this
as
a
tacit
permission
to
leave
their
bills
unpaid
he
had
locked
himself
and
his
into
a
small
back
room
where
stood
the
few
articles
they
had
picked
out
to
carry
with
them
mary
his
first
gift
to
her
after
marriage
their
modest
stock
of
silver
his
medical
library
but
he
had
been
forced
to
lower
the
blind
to
hinder
impertinent
noses
flattening
themselves
against
the
window
and
thus
could
scarcely
see
to
put
pen
to
paper
while
the
auctioneer
grating
voice
was
a
constant
source
of
distraction
not
to
mention
the
rude
comments
made
by
the
crowd
on
house
and
furniture
the
ceaseless
trying
of
the
handle
of
the
locked
door
when
it
came
to
the
point
this
tearing
up
of
one
roots
was
a
murderous
business
nothing
for
a
man
of
his
temperament
mary
was
a
good
deal
better
able
to
stand
it
than
he
violently
as
she
had
opposed
the
move
in
the
beginning
she
was
now
dear
soul
putting
a
cheery
face
on
it
but
then
mary
belonged
to
that
happy
class
of
mortals
who
could
set
up
their
lares
and
penates
inside
any
four
walls
whereas
he
was
a
very
slave
to
associations
did
she
regret
parting
with
a
pretty
table
and
a
comfortable
chair
it
was
soley
because
of
the
prettiness
and
convenience
as
long
as
she
could
replace
them
by
other
articles
of
the
same
kind
she
was
content
but
to
him
each
familiar
object
was
bound
by
a
thousand
memories
and
it
was
the
loss
of
these
which
could
never
be
replaced
that
cut
him
to
the
quick
meanwhile
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
had
to
listen
to
now
ladies
and
gents
we
a
very
fine
pier
glass
a
very
chaste
and
tasty
pier
glass
indeed
a
red
addition
to
any
mrs
rupp
do
i
understand
you
aright
rupp
rupp
offers
twelve
bob
for
this
very
article
twelve
bob
going
twelve
fifteen
thank
you
bromby
going
fifteen
going
going
eighteen
right
you
are
my
dear
and
so
on
it
had
a
history
had
that
pier
glass
its
purchase
dated
from
a
time
in
their
lives
when
they
had
been
forced
to
turn
each
shilling
in
the
palm
mary
had
espied
it
one
day
in
plaistows
stores
and
had
set
her
heart
on
buying
it
how
she
had
schemed
to
scrape
the
money
together
saving
so
much
on
a
new
gown
so
much
on
bonnet
and
mantle
he
remembered
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
morning
on
which
she
had
burst
in
eyes
and
cheeks
aglow
to
tell
him
that
she
had
managed
it
at
last
and
how
they
had
gone
off
arm
in
arm
to
secure
the
prize
yes
for
all
their
poverty
those
had
been
happy
days
little
extravagances
such
as
this
or
the
trifling
gifts
they
had
contrived
to
make
each
other
had
given
far
more
pleasure
than
the
costlier
presents
of
later
years
the
next
article
i
draw
your
attention
to
is
a
sofer
went
on
the
voice
sounding
suddenly
closer
and
with
a
great
trampling
and
shuffling
the
crowd
trooped
after
it
to
the
adjoining
room
and
a
very
easy
and
comfortable
piece
o
furniture
it
is
too
a
bit
shabby
and
worn
and
there
but
not
any
the
worse
of
that
you
do
need
to
worry
if
the
kids
play
on
it
and
it
fits
the
shape
o
the
body
all
the
any
one
like
to
try
it
jest
the
very
thing
for
a
tired
gent
from
biz
or
to
pop
your
lady
on
when
she
faints
as
the
best
of
ladies
will
any
de

he
said
deelay
plastreer
a
guinea
thank
you
mister
one
guinea
going
a
guinea
now
come
on
ladies
and
d
think
i
got
a
notion
to
make
you
a
present
of
it
what
that
gawd
is
this
a
tiddlin
match
how
proud
he
had
been
of
that
sofa
in
his
first
surgery
he
had
had
nowhere
to
lay
an
aching
head
well
worn
small
wonder
he
would
like
to
know
how
many
hundreds
of
times
he
had
flung
himself
down
on
it
utterly
played
out
he
had
been
used
to
lie
there
of
an
evening
too
when
mary
came
in
to
chat
about
household
affairs
or
report
on
her
day
doings
and
he
remembered
another
time
when
he
had
spent
the
last
hours
of
a
distracted
night
on
it
and
how
between
sleeping
and
waking
he
had
strained
his
ears
for
footsteps
that
never
came
the
sofa
was
knocked
down
to
his
butcher
for
a
couple
of
pounds
and
the
crying
or
decrying
of
his
bookcases
began
he
could
stand
no
more
of
it
sweeping
his
papers
into
a
bag
he
guiltily
unlocked
the
door
and
stole
out
by
way
of
kitchen
and
back
gate
but
once
outside
he
did
not
know
where
to
go
or
what
to
do
leaving
the
town
behind
him
he
made
for
the
lake
and
roved
aimlessly
and
disconsolately
about
choosing
sheltered
paths
and
remote
roads
where
he
would
be
unlikely
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
acquaintances
for
he
shrank
from
recognition
on
this
particular
day
when
all
his
domestic
privacies
were
being
bared
to
the
public
view
but
altogether
of
late
he
had
fought
shy
of
meeting
people
their
hard
faces
showed
him
only
too
plainly
what
they
thought
of
him
at
first
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
scan
them
eagerly
in
the
hope
of
finding
one
saving
touch
of
sympathy
or
comprehension
but
he
might
as
well
have
looked
for
grief
in
the
eyes
of
an
undertaker
mute
and
so
he
had
shrunk
back
into
himself
wearing
his
stiffest
air
as
a
shield
and
leaving
it
to
mary
to
parry
colonial
inquisitiveness
when
he
reckoned
that
he
had
allowed
time
enough
for
the
disposal
of
the
last
pots
and
pans
he
rose
and
made
his
way
well
the
word
home
was
by
now
become
a
mere
figure
of
speech
he
entered
a
scene
of
the
wildest
confusion
the
actual
sale
was
over
but
the
work
of
stripping
the
house
only
begun
and
successful
bidders
were
dragging
off
their
spoils
his
bookcase
had
been
got
as
far
as
the
there
it
had
stuck
fast
and
an
angry
altercation
was
going
on
how
best
to
set
it
free
a
woman
passed
him
bearing
girandoles
another
had
the
clock
under
her
arm
a
third
trailed
a
whatnot
after
her
to
the
palings
of
the
fence
several
carts
and
buggies
had
been
hitched
and
the
horses
were
eating
down
his
neatly
clipped
hedge
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
rush
out
and
call
their
owners
to
account
the
level
sunrays
flooded
the
rooms
showing
up
hitherto
unnoticed
smudges
and
scratches
on
the
showing
the
prints
of
hundreds
of
dusty
feet
on
the
carpetless
floors
voices
echoed
in
hollow
fashion
through
the
naked
rooms
men
shouted
and
spat
as
they
tugged
heavy
articles
along
the
hall
or
bumped
them
down
the
stairs
it
was
pandemonium
the
death
of
a
loved
human
being
could
not
he
thought
have
been
more
painful
to
witness
thus
a
home
went
to
pieces
thus
was
a
page
of
one
life
he
hastened
away
to
rejoin
mary
there
followed
a
week
of
tilly
somewhat
stifling
hospitality
when
one
was
forced
three
times
a
day
to
oneself
for
fear
of
giving
offence
followed
formal
presentations
of
silver
and
plate
from
masonic
lodge
and
district
hospital
as
well
as
a
couple
of
public
testimonials
got
up
by
his
medical
brethren
but
at
length
all
was
over
the
last
visit
had
been
paid
and
received
the
last
evening
party
in
their
honour
sat
through
and
mahony
breathed
again
he
had
felt
stiff
and
unnatural
under
this
overdose
of
demonstrativeness
now
as
always
on
sighting
relief
from
a
state
of
things
that
irked
him
he
underwent
a
sudden
change
turned
hearty
and
spontaneous
thus
innocently
succeeding
in
leaving
a
good
impression
behind
him
he
kept
his
temper
too
in
all
the
fuss
and
ado
of
departure
the
running
to
and
fro
after
missing
articles
the
sitting
on
the
lids
of
overflowing
trunks
the
strapping
of
affixing
of
labels
their
luggage
hoisted
into
a
they
themselves
took
their
seats
in
the
buggy
and
were
driven
to
the
railway
station
and
to
himself
mahony
murmured
an
on
alighting
however
he
found
that
his
greatcoat
had
been
forgotten
he
had
to
himself
in
the
buggy
and
gallop
back
to
the
house
arriving
at
the
station
only
just
in
time
to
leap
into
the
train
a
close
shave
that
he
ejaculated
as
he
sank
on
the
cushions
and
wiped
his
face
and
in
more
senses
than
one
my
dear
in
tearing
round
a
corner
we
nearly
had
a
nasty
spill
had
i
pitched
out
and
broken
my
neck
this
hole
would
have
got
my
bones
after
not
that
i
was
sorry
to
miss
that
mary
it
was
really
too
much
of
a
good
thing
altogether
for
a
large
and
noisy
crowd
had
gathered
round
the
door
of
the
carriage
to
wish
the
travellers
among
them
people
to
whom
mahony
could
not
even
put
a
name
whose
very
existence
he
had
forgotten
and
it
had
fairly
snowed
last
gifts
and
keepsakes
drying
her
eyes
mary
now
set
to
collecting
and
arranging
these
just
fancy
so
many
turning
up
dear
the
railway
people
must
have
wondered
what
was
the
oh
by
the
way
did
you
notice
i
do
think
you
did
you
were
in
such
a
rush
who
i
was
speaking
to
as
you
ran
up
it
was
jim
old
jim
but
so
changed
i
hardly
knew
him
as
spruce
as
could
be
in
a
black
coat
and
a
belltopper
he
married
again
he
told
me
and
has
one
of
the
hotels
in
smythesdale
yes
and
he
was
at
the
sale
too
he
came
over
specially
for
it
to
buy
the
piano
he
did
confound
him
cried
mahony
hotly
oh
you
ca
look
at
it
that
way
richard
as
long
as
he
has
the
money
to
pay
for
it
fancy
he
told
me
had
always
admired
the
of
it
so
much
when
i
played
and
sang
my
dear
little
piano
you
shall
have
another
and
a
better
one
i
promise
you
old
girl
do
fret
well
that
slice
of
our
life
over
and
done
with
he
added
and
laid
his
hand
on
hers
but
we
hold
together
we
wife
whatever
happens
they
had
passed
black
hill
and
its
multicoloured
clay
and
gravel
heaps
and
the
train
was
puffing
uphill
the
last
scattered
huts
and
weatherboards
fell
behind
the
holes
grew
fewer
wooded
rises
appeared
gradually
too
the
white
roads
round
mount
buninyong
came
into
view
and
the
trees
became
denser
and
having
climbed
the
shoulder
they
began
to
fly
smoothly
and
rapidly
down
the
other
side
mahony
bent
forward
in
his
seat
there
goes
the
last
of
old
warrenheip
thank
the
lord
i
shall
never
set
eyes
on
it
again
upon
my
word
i
believe
i
came
to
think
that
hill
the
most
tiresome
feature
of
the
place
whatever
street
one
turned
into
up
it
bobbed
at
the
foot
like
a
or
a
bad
dream
or
a
prison
wall
in
melbourne
they
were
the
guests
of
john
mahony
had
reluctantly
resigned
himself
to
being
beholden
to
mary
relatives
and
friends
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
at
best
living
in
other
houses
was
for
him
more
of
a
punishment
than
a
pleasure
but
for
sheer
discomfort
this
stay
capped
the
climax
under
zara
incompetent
rule
john
home
had
degenerated
into
a
lawless
and
slovenly
abode
the
meals
were
unpalatable
the
servants
pert
and
lazy
while
the
children
ran
wild
you
could
hardly
hear
yourself
speak
for
the
racket
whenever
possible
mahony
fled
the
house
he
lunched
in
town
looked
up
his
handful
of
acquaintances
bought
necessaries
and
unnecessaries
for
the
voyage
he
also
hired
a
boat
and
had
himself
rowed
out
to
the
ship
where
he
clambered
on
board
amid
the
mess
of
scouring
and
painting
and
made
himself
known
to
the
chief
mate
or
he
sat
on
the
pier
and
gazed
at
the
vessel
lying
straining
at
her
anchor
while
quick
swept
up
and
blotted
out
the
bay
of
mary
he
caught
but
passing
glimpses
her
family
seemed
determined
to
make
unblushing
use
of
her
as
long
as
she
was
within
reach
a
couple
of
days
prior
to
their
arrival
john
and
zara
had
quarrelled
violently
and
for
the
dozenth
time
zara
had
packed
her
trunks
and
departed
for
one
of
those
miraculous
situations
the
doors
of
which
always
stood
open
to
her
john
was
for
mary
going
after
her
and
forcing
her
to
admit
the
error
of
her
ways
mary
held
it
wiser
to
let
well
alone
do
be
guided
by
me
this
time
john
she
urged
when
she
had
heard
her
brother
out
you
and
zara
will
never
hit
it
off
however
often
you
try
but
the
belief
was
ingrained
in
john
that
the
most
suitable
head
for
his
establishment
was
one
of
his
own
blood
he
answered
indignantly
and
why
not
pray
may
i
ask
who
is
to
hit
it
off
as
you
put
it
if
not
two
of
a
family
oh
john
mary
felt
quite
apologetic
for
her
brother
clever
as
zara
is
she
not
at
all
fitted
for
a
post
of
this
kind
she
no
hand
with
the
servants
and
children
do
seem
to
take
to
her
young
children
i
mean
not
fitted
bah
said
john
every
woman
is
fitted
by
nature
to
rear
children
and
manage
a
house
they
should
be
i
know
yielded
mary
in
conciliatory
fashion
but
with
zara
it
does
seem
to
be
the
case
then
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
my
dear
mary
ashamed
of
herself
and
that
all
about
it
zara
wept
into
a
dainty
handkerchief
and
was
delivered
of
a
rigmarole
of
complaints
against
her
brother
the
servants
the
children
according
to
her
the
last
were
naturally
perverse
and
john
indulged
them
so
shockingly
that
she
had
been
powerless
to
carry
out
reforms
did
she
punish
them
he
cancelled
the
punishments
if
she
left
their
naughtiness
unchecked
he
accused
her
of
indifference
then
her
housekeeping
had
not
suited
him
he
reproached
her
with
extravagance
with
mismanagement
even
with
lining
her
own
purse
while
the
truth
is
john
is
mean
as
dirt
i
had
literally
to
drag
each
penny
out
of
him
but
what
ever
induced
you
to
undertake
it
again
zara
yes
what
indeed
echoed
zara
bitterly
however
once
bitten
mary
twice
shy
never
again
but
remembering
the
bites
zara
had
already
received
mary
was
silent
even
zara
amateurish
hand
thus
finally
withdrawn
it
became
task
to
find
some
worthy
and
capable
person
to
act
as
mistress
taking
her
obligations
seriously
she
devoted
her
last
days
in
australia
to
conning
and
penning
advertisements
and
interviewing
applicants
now
no
one
too
attractive
if
you
please
mrs
mahony
if
you
want
him
to
fall
a
victim
teased
richard
remember
our
good
inflammability
he
a
very
leyden
jar
again
at
present
no
indeed
i
do
said
mary
with
emphasis
but
the
children
are
the
first
consideration
oh
dear
it
does
seem
a
shame
that
tilly
should
have
them
to
look
after
and
it
would
relieve
john
of
so
much
responsibility
as
it
is
he
even
asked
me
to
make
it
plain
to
tilly
that
he
wishes
trotty
to
spend
her
holidays
at
school
the
forsaking
of
the
poor
little
motherless
flock
cut
mary
to
the
heart
trotty
had
dung
to
her
inconsolable
oh
auntie
take
me
with
you
oh
what
shall
i
do
without
you
it
not
possible
darling
your
papa
would
never
agree
but
i
tell
you
what
trotty
you
must
be
a
good
girl
and
make
haste
and
learn
all
you
can
for
soon
i
sure
he
want
you
to
come
and
be
his
little
housekeeper
and
look
after
the
other
children
sounded
on
this
subject
however
john
said
dryly
emma
influence
would
be
undesirable
for
the
little
ones
his
prejudice
in
favour
of
his
second
wife
children
was
an
eternal
riddle
to
his
sister
he
dandled
even
the
youngest
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
its
birth
with
visible
pleasure
it
must
be
the
black
eyes
said
mary
to
herself
and
shook
her
head
at
men
irrationality
for
jinny
offspring
had
none
of
the
grace
and
beauty
that
marked
the
two
elder
children
and
now
the
last
night
had
come
and
they
were
gathered
a
family
party
round
john
mahogany
the
cloth
had
been
removed
nuts
and
port
were
passing
as
it
was
a
unique
occasion
the
ladies
had
been
excused
from
withdrawing
and
the
gentlemen
left
their
cigars
unlighted
eyes
roved
fondly
from
one
face
to
another
there
was
tilly
come
over
from
her
hotel
nothing
would
induce
me
to
spend
a
night
under
his
roof
mary
tilly
sat
hugging
one
of
the
children
who
had
run
in
for
the
almonds
and
raisins
of
dessert
what
a
mother
lost
in
her
sighed
mary
once
more
there
was
zara
so
far
reconciled
to
her
brother
as
to
consent
to
be
present
but
only
speaking
at
him
not
to
him
and
dear
jerry
eager
and
alert
taking
so
intelligent
a
share
in
what
was
said
poor
ned
alone
was
wanting
neither
richard
nor
john
having
offered
to
pay
his
fare
to
town
young
johnny
seat
was
vacant
too
for
the
boy
had
vanished
directly
dinner
was
over
in
the
harmony
of
the
evening
there
was
just
one
jarring
note
for
mary
and
at
moments
she
grew
very
thoughtful
for
the
first
time
kelly
the
motherly
widow
on
whom
her
choice
had
fallen
sat
opposite
john
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
already
mary
was
the
prey
of
a
nagging
doubt
for
this
person
had
doffed
the
neat
she
had
worn
when
being
engaged
and
come
forth
in
a
cap
trimmed
with
cherry
coloured
ribbons
not
only
this
she
smiled
in
sugary
fashion
and
far
too
readily
while
the
extreme
humility
with
which
she
deferred
to
john
opinion
and
hung
on
his
lips
made
another
bad
impression
on
mary
nor
was
she
alone
in
her
observations
after
a
particularly
glaring
example
of
the
widow
complaisance
tilly
looked
across
and
shut
one
eye
in
an
unmistakable
wink
meanwhile
the
men
talk
had
gradually
petered
out
there
came
long
pauses
in
which
they
twiddled
and
twirled
their
unable
to
think
of
anything
to
say
at
heart
both
john
and
mahony
hailed
with
a
certain
relief
the
coming
break
after
all
i
dare
say
such
a
queer
faddy
fellow
is
out
of
his
element
here
he
go
down
better
over
there
was
john
mental
verdict
mahony
a
characteristic
thank
god
i
shall
not
have
to
put
up
much
longer
with
his
confounded
or
suffer
under
his
matrimonial
muddles
when
at
a
question
from
mary
john
began
animatedly
to
discuss
the
tuition
of
the
younger
children
mahony
seized
the
chance
to
slip
away
he
would
not
be
missed
he
never
was
here
or
anywhere
on
the
verandah
a
dark
form
stirred
and
made
a
hasty
movement
it
was
the
boy
johnny
now
grown
tall
as
mahony
himself
and
to
judge
from
the
smell
what
he
tried
to
smuggle
into
his
pocket
was
a
briar
oh
well
yes
i
smoking
he
said
sullenly
after
a
feeble
attempt
at
evasion
go
in
and
blab
on
me
if
you
feel
you
must
uncle
richard
nonsense
but
telling
fibs
about
a
thing
does
no
good
oh
yes
it
does
it
saves
a
hiding
retorted
the
boy
and
added
with
a
youthful
vehemence
i
hanged
if
i
let
the
governor
take
a
stick
to
me
nowadays
i
turned
sixteen
and
if
he
dares
to
touch
me
come
come
you
know
you
been
something
of
a
disappointment
to
your
father
johnny
that
the
root
of
the
trouble
glad
if
i
have
he
hates
me
anyway
he
never
cared
for
my
children
answered
johnny
with
a
quaint
dignity
i
think
he
have
cared
for
her
either
there
you
wrong
he
was
devoted
to
her
her
death
nearly
broke
his
she
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
i
have
ever
seen
my
boy
was
she
said
johnny
civilly
but
with
meagre
interest
this
long
dead
mother
had
bequeathed
him
not
even
a
memory
of
herself
was
as
unreal
to
him
as
a
dream
at
second
hand
from
the
chilly
contemplation
of
her
he
turned
back
impatiently
to
his
own
affairs
which
were
burning
insistent
and
scenting
a
vague
sympathy
in
this
stranger
uncle
who
like
himself
had
drifted
out
from
the
intimacy
of
the
room
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
his
troubles
i
ca
stand
the
life
here
uncle
richard
and
i
not
going
to
not
if
father
cuts
me
off
with
a
shilling
i
mean
to
see
the
world
this
is
the
world
this
old
country
though
it
got
to
seem
like
it
to
the
governor
he
been
here
so
long
and
he
cleared
out
from
his
before
he
was
even
as
old
as
i
am
of
course
there
another
blessed
old
australia
for
me
to
decamp
to
he
might
be
a
bit
sweeter
about
it
if
there
was
but
america
good
enough
for
me
and
i
off
there
yes
even
if
i
have
to
work
my
passage
out
early
next
morning
fully
equipped
for
their
journey
the
mahonys
stood
on
the
william
town
pier
the
centre
of
the
usual
crowd
of
relatives
and
friends
this
had
been
further
swelled
by
the
advent
of
devine
who
came
panting
up
followed
by
her
husband
and
by
agnes
ocock
and
amelia
grindle
who
had
contrived
to
reach
melbourne
the
previous
evening
even
john
children
were
tacked
on
clad
in
their
sunday
best
everybody
talked
at
once
and
laughed
or
wept
while
the
children
played
round
the
ladies
crinolines
strange
eyes
were
bent
on
their
party
strange
ears
cocked
in
their
direction
and
yet
once
again
mahony
dislike
to
a
commotion
in
public
choked
off
his
gratitude
towards
these
good
and
kindly
people
but
his
star
was
rising
tears
and
farewells
and
vows
of
constancy
had
to
be
cut
short
a
jaunt
planned
by
the
whole
company
to
the
ship
itself
abandoned
for
a
favourable
wind
had
sprung
up
and
the
captain
was
impatient
to
weigh
anchor
and
so
the
very
last
kisses
and
handclasps
exchanged
the
travellers
climbed
down
into
a
boat
already
deep
in
the
water
with
other
and
their
luggage
and
were
rowed
out
to
where
lay
that
good
the
red
jacket
sitting
side
by
side
husband
and
wife
watched
with
feelings
that
had
little
in
common
the
receding
quay
mary
fluttering
her
damp
handkerchief
till
the
separate
figures
had
merged
in
one
dark
mass
and
even
tilly
planted
in
front
her
handkerchief
tied
flagwise
to
the
top
of
jerry
cane
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
from
the
rest
mahony
foot
met
the
ribbed
teak
of
the
deck
with
the
liveliest
satisfaction
his
nostrils
drank
in
the
smell
of
tarred
ropes
and
oiled
brass
having
escorted
mary
below
seen
to
the
stowing
away
of
their
belongings
and
changed
his
town
clothes
for
a
set
of
comfortable
baggy
garments
he
returned
to
the
deck
where
he
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
tirelessly
pacing
they
made
good
headway
and
soon
the
ports
and
towns
at
the
water
edge
were
become
mere
whitey
smudges
the
hills
in
the
background
lasted
longer
but
first
the
macedon
group
faded
from
sight
then
the
dandenong
ranges
grown
bluer
and
bluer
were
also
lost
in
the
sky
the
vessel
crept
round
the
outside
of
the
great
bay
to
clear
shoals
and
sandbanks
and
by
afternoon
with
the
sails
close
rigged
in
the
freshening
wind
they
were
running
parallel
with
the
cliff
the
cliff
thought
mahony
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
and
indeed
there
was
no
other
nothing
but
low
sandhills
which
flattened
out
till
they
were
almost
level
with
the
sea
the
passage
through
the
heads
was
at
hand
impulsively
he
went
down
to
fetch
mary
threading
his
way
through
the
saloon
in
the
middle
of
which
grew
up
one
of
the
masts
he
opened
a
door
leading
off
it
come
on
deck
my
dear
and
take
your
last
look
at
the
old
place
not
likely
you
ever
see
it
again
but
mary
was
already
encoffined
in
her
narrow
berth
do
ask
me
even
to
lift
my
head
from
the
pillow
richard
besides
i
seen
it
so
often
before
he
lingered
to
make
some
arrangements
for
her
comfort
fidgeted
to
know
where
she
had
put
his
books
then
mounted
a
locker
and
craned
his
neck
at
the
porthole
now
for
the
rip
wife
by
god
mary
i
little
thought
this
time
last
year
that
i
should
be
crossing
it
but
the
cabin
was
too
dark
and
small
to
hold
him
climbing
the
steep
he
went
on
deck
again
and
resumed
his
flittings
to
and
fro
he
was
no
more
able
to
be
still
than
was
the
good
ship
under
him
he
felt
himself
one
with
her
and
gloried
in
her
growing
unrest
she
was
now
come
to
the
narrow
channel
between
two
converging
headlands
where
the
waters
of
hobson
bay
met
those
of
the
open
sea
they
boiled
and
churned
in
an
eternal
commotion
over
treacherous
reefs
which
thrust
far
out
below
the
surface
and
were
betrayed
by
straight
white
lines
of
foam
once
safely
out
the
vessel
hove
to
to
drop
the
pilot
leaning
over
the
gunwale
mahony
watched
a
boat
come
alongside
the
man
of
oilskins
climb
down
the
and
row
away
here
in
the
open
a
heavy
swell
was
running
but
he
kept
his
foot
on
the
swaying
boards
long
after
the
last
of
his
had
vanished
a
tall
thin
figure
with
an
eager
pointed
face
and
hair
just
greying
at
the
temples
contrary
to
habit
he
had
a
word
for
every
one
who
passed
from
mate
to
and
he
drank
a
glass
of
wine
with
the
captain
in
his
cabin
their
start
had
been
auspicious
said
the
latter
seldom
had
he
had
such
a
fair
wind
to
come
out
with
then
the
sun
fell
into
the
sea
and
it
was
night
a
fine
starry
night
clear
with
the
hard
cold
radiance
of
the
south
mahony
looked
up
at
the
familiar
constellations
and
thought
of
those
others
long
missed
that
he
was
soon
to
see
over
this
page
of
his
history
was
turned
and
done
with
and
he
had
every
reason
to
feel
thankful
for
many
and
many
a
man
though
escaping
with
his
life
had
left
youth
and
health
and
hope
on
these
difficult
shores
he
had
got
off
still
in
his
prime
his
faculties
green
his
zest
for
living
unimpaired
he
was
heading
for
the
dear
old
mother
country
for
home
alone
and
unaided
he
could
never
have
accomplished
it
strength
to
will
the
enterprise
steadfastness
in
the
face
of
obstacles
had
been
lent
him
from
above
and
as
he
stood
gazing
down
into
the
black
and
fathomless
deep
which
sent
crafty
licking
tongues
up
the
side
he
freely
acknowledged
his
debt
gave
honour
where
honour
was
from
thee
cometh
victory
from
thee
cometh
wisdom
and
thine
is
the
glory
and
i
am
thy
servant
the
last
spark
of
a
went
out
buffeted
by
the
rising
wind
the
good
ship
began
to
pitch
and
roll
her
canvas
rattled
her
joints
creaked
and
groaned
as
lunging
forward
she
cut
her
way
through
the
troubled
seas
that
break
on
the
coasts
of
this
old
new
world
