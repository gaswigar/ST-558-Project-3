and

is
dancing
the

of
the

on

it
is
a
brilliant
ball
the
band
is
complete
the
room
is
spacious
the
large
conservatory
opening
out
of
it
is
pleasantly
lighted
with
chinese
lanterns
and
beautifully
decorated
with
shrubs
and
flowers
all
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
who
are
present
wear
their
uniforms
in
honor
of
the
occasion
among
the
ladies
the
display
of
dresses
a
subject
which
the
men
don
t
understand
is
bewildering
and
the
average
of
beauty
a
subject
which
the
men
do
understand
is
the
highest
average
attainable
in
all
parts
of
the
room
for
the
moment
the
dance
which
is
in
progress
is
a
quadrille
general
admiration
selects
two
of
the
ladies
who
are
dancing
as
its
favorite
objects
one
is
a
dark
beauty
in
the
prime
of
womanhood
the
wife
of
first
lieutenant
crayford
of
the
the
other
is
a
young
girl
pale
and
delicate
dressed
simply
in
white
with
no
ornament
on
her
head
but
her
own
lovely
brown
hair
this
is
miss
clara
burnham
an
orphan
she
is
crayford
s
dearest
friend
and
she
is
to
stay
with
crayford
during
the
lieutenant
s
absence
in
the
arctic
regions
she
is
now
dancing
with
the
lieutenant
himself
for
partner
and
with
crayford
and
captain
helding
commanding
officer
of
the
for
in
plain
english
for
opposite
couple
the
conversation
between
captain
helding
and
crayford
in
one
of
the
intervals
of
the
dance
turns
on
miss
burnham
the
captain
is
greatly
interested
in
clara
he
admires
her
beauty
but
he
thinks
her
manner
for
a
young
girl
strangely
serious
and
subdued
is
she
in
delicate
health
crayford
shakes
her
head
sighs
mysteriously
and
answers
in
delicate
health
captain
consumptive
not
in
the
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
she
is
a
charming
creature
crayford
she
interests
me
indescribably
if
i
was
only
twenty
years
younger
perhaps
as
i
am
not
twenty
years
younger
i
had
better
not
finish
the
sentence
is
it
indiscreet
my
dear
lady
to
inquire
what
the
matter
with
her
it
might
be
indiscreet
on
the
part
of
a
stranger
said
crayford
an
old
friend
like
you
may
make
any
inquiries
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
what
is
the
matter
with
clara
it
is
a
mystery
to
the
doctors
themselves
some
of
the
mischief
is
due
in
my
humble
opinion
to
the
manner
in
which
she
has
been
brought
ay
ay
a
bad
school
i
very
bad
captain
helding
but
not
the
sort
of
school
which
you
have
in
your
mind
at
this
moment
clara
s
early
years
were
spent
in
a
lonely
old
house
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
ignorant
people
about
her
were
the
people
who
did
the
mischief
which
i
have
just
been
speaking
of
they
filled
her
mind
with
the
superstitions
which
are
still
respected
as
truths
in
the
wild
north
especially
the
superstition
called
the
second
god
bless
me
cried
the
captain
you
don
t
mean
to
say
she
believes
in
such
stuff
as
that
in
these
enlightened
times
too
crayford
looked
at
her
partner
with
a
satirical
smile
in
these
enlightened
times
captain
helding
we
only
believe
in
dancing
tables
and
in
messages
sent
from
the
other
world
by
spirits
who
can
t
spell
by
comparison
with
such
superstitions
as
these
even
the
second
sight
has
something
in
the
shape
of
poetry
to
recommend
it
surely
estimate
for
yourself
she
continued
seriously
the
effect
of
such
surroundings
as
i
have
described
on
a
delicate
sensitive
young
creature
a
girl
with
a
naturally
imaginative
temperament
leading
a
lonely
neglected
life
is
it
so
very
surprising
that
she
should
catch
the
infection
of
the
superstition
about
her
and
is
it
quite
incomprehensible
that
her
nervous
system
should
suffer
accordingly
at
a
very
critical
period
of
her
life
not
at
all
crayford
not
at
all
ma
am
as
you
put
it
still
it
is
a
little
startling
to
a
commonplace
man
like
me
to
meet
a
young
lady
at
a
ball
who
believes
in
the
second
sight
does
she
really
profess
to
see
into
the
future
am
i
to
understand
that
she
positively
falls
into
a
trance
and
sees
people
in
distant
countries
and
foretells
events
to
come
that
is
the
second
sight
is
it
not
that
is
the
second
sight
captain
and
that
is
really
and
positively
what
she
the
young
lady
who
is
dancing
opposite
to
us
the
young
lady
who
is
dancing
opposite
to
the
captain
waited
a
little
letting
the
new
flood
of
information
which
had
poured
in
on
him
settle
itself
steadily
in
his
mind
this
process
accomplished
the
arctic
explorer
proceeded
resolutely
on
his
way
to
further
discoveries
may
i
ask
ma
am
if
you
have
ever
seen
her
in
a
state
of
trance
with
your
own
eyes
he
inquired
my
sister
and
i
both
saw
her
in
the
trance
little
more
than
a
month
since
crayford
replied
she
had
been
nervous
and
irritable
all
the
morning
and
we
took
her
out
into
the
garden
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
suddenly
without
any
reason
for
it
the
color
left
her
face
she
stood
between
us
insensible
to
touch
insensible
to
sound
motionless
as
stone
and
cold
as
death
in
a
moment
the
first
change
we
noticed
came
after
a
lapse
of
some
minutes
her
hands
began
to
move
slowly
as
if
she
was
groping
in
the
dark
words
dropped
one
by
one
from
her
lips
in
a
lost
vacant
tone
as
if
she
was
talking
in
her
sleep
whether
what
she
said
referred
to
past
or
future
i
can
not
tell
you
she
spoke
of
persons
in
a
foreign
country
perfect
strangers
to
my
sister
and
to
me
after
a
little
interval
she
suddenly
became
silent
a
momentary
color
appeared
in
her
face
and
left
it
again
her
eyes
closed
her
feet
failed
her
and
she
sank
insensible
into
our
sank
insensible
into
your
arms
repeated
the
captain
absorbing
his
new
information
most
extraordinary
and
in
this
state
of
health
she
goes
out
to
parties
and
dances
more
extraordinary
still
you
are
entirely
mistaken
said
crayford
she
is
only
here
to
please
me
and
she
is
only
dancing
to
please
my
husband
as
a
rule
she
shuns
all
society
the
doctor
recommends
change
and
amusement
for
her
she
won
t
listen
to
him
except
on
rare
occasions
like
this
she
persists
in
remaining
at
captain
helding
brightened
at
the
allusion
to
the
doctor
something
practical
might
be
got
out
of
the
doctor
scientific
man
sure
to
see
this
very
obscure
subject
under
a
new
light
how
does
it
strike
the
doctor
now
said
the
captain
viewed
simply
as
a
case
ma
am
how
does
it
strike
the
doctor
he
will
give
no
positive
opinion
crayford
answered
he
told
me
that
such
cases
as
clara
s
were
by
no
means
unfamiliar
to
medical
practice
we
know
he
told
me
that
certain
disordered
conditions
of
the
brain
and
the
nervous
system
produce
results
quite
as
extraordinary
as
any
that
you
have
described
and
there
our
knowledge
ends
neither
my
science
nor
any
man
s
science
can
clear
up
the
mystery
in
this
case
it
is
an
especially
difficult
case
to
deal
with
because
miss
burnham
s
early
associations
dispose
her
to
attach
a
superstitious
importance
to
the
malady
the
hysterical
malady
as
some
doctors
would
call
it
from
which
she
suffers
i
can
give
you
instructions
for
preserving
her
general
health
and
i
can
recommend
you
to
try
some
change
in
her
life
provided
you
first
relieve
her
mind
of
any
secret
anxieties
that
may
possibly
be
preying
on
the
captain
smiled
the
doctor
had
justified
his
anticipations
the
doctor
had
suggested
a
practical
solution
of
the
difficulty
ay
ay
at
last
we
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
secret
anxieties
yes
yes
plain
enough
now
a
disappointment
in
love
eh
crayford
i
don
t
know
captain
helding
i
am
quite
in
the
dark
clara
s
confidence
in
me
in
other
matters
unbounded
is
in
this
matter
of
her
supposed
anxieties
a
confidence
still
withheld
in
all
else
we
are
like
sisters
i
sometimes
fear
there
may
indeed
be
some
trouble
preying
secretly
on
her
mind
i
sometimes
feel
a
little
hurt
at
her
incomprehensible
captain
helding
was
ready
with
his
own
practical
remedy
for
this
difficulty
encouragement
is
all
she
wants
ma
am
take
my
word
for
it
this
matter
rests
entirely
with
you
it
s
all
in
a
nutshell
encourage
her
to
confide
in
you
and
she
i
am
waiting
to
encourage
her
captain
until
she
is
left
alone
with
me
after
you
have
all
sailed
for
the
arctic
seas
in
the
meantime
will
you
consider
what
i
have
said
to
you
as
intended
for
your
ear
only
and
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
own
that
the
turn
the
subject
has
taken
does
not
tempt
me
to
pursue
it
any
further
the
captain
took
the
hint
he
instantly
changed
the
subject
choosing
on
this
occasion
safe
professional
topics
he
spoke
of
ships
that
were
ordered
on
foreign
service
and
finding
that
these
as
subjects
failed
to
interest
crayford
he
spoke
next
of
ships
that
were
ordered
home
again
this
last
experiment
produced
its
effect
an
effect
which
the
captain
had
not
bargained
for
do
you
know
he
began
that
the
is
expected
back
from
the
west
coast
of
africa
every
day
have
you
any
acquaintances
among
the
officers
of
that
ship
as
it
so
happened
he
put
those
questions
to
crayford
while
they
were
engaged
in
one
of
the
figures
of
the
dance
which
brought
them
within
hearing
of
the
opposite
couple
at
the
same
moment
to
the
astonishment
of
her
friends
and
admirers
miss
clara
burnham
threw
the
quadrille
into
confusion
by
making
a
mistake
everybody
waited
to
see
her
set
the
mistake
right
she
made
no
attempt
to
set
it
right
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
caught
her
partner
by
the
arm
the
heat
she
said
faintly
take
me
away
take
me
into
the
air
lieutenant
crayford
instantly
led
her
out
of
the
dance
and
took
her
into
the
cool
and
empty
conservatory
at
the
end
of
the
room
as
a
matter
of
course
captain
helding
and
crayford
left
the
quadrille
at
the
same
time
the
captain
saw
his
way
to
a
joke
is
this
the
trance
coming
on
he
whispered
if
it
is
as
commander
of
the
arctic
expedition
i
have
a
particular
request
to
make
will
the
second
sight
oblige
me
by
seeing
the
shortest
way
to
the
northwest
passage
before
we
leave
england
crayford
declined
to
humor
the
joke
if
you
will
excuse
my
leaving
you
she
said
quietly
i
will
try
and
find
out
what
is
the
matter
with
miss
at
the
entrance
to
the
conservatory
crayford
encountered
her
husband
the
lieutenant
was
of
middle
age
tall
and
comely
a
man
with
a
winning
simplicity
and
gentleness
in
his
manner
and
an
irresistible
kindness
in
his
brave
blue
eyes
in
one
word
a
man
whom
everybody
loved
including
his
wife
don
t
be
alarmed
said
the
lieutenant
the
heat
has
overcome
her
that
s
crayford
shook
her
head
and
looked
at
her
husband
half
satirically
half
fondly
you
dear
old
innocent
she
exclaimed
that
excuse
may
do
for
for
my
part
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
go
and
get
another
partner
and
leave
clara
to
she
entered
the
conservatory
and
seated
herself
by
clara
s
side
chapter
now
my
dear
crayford
began
what
does
this
mean
that
won
t
do
clara
try
the
heat
of
the
room
that
won
t
do
either
say
that
you
choose
to
keep
your
own
secrets
and
i
shall
understand
what
you
clara
s
sad
clear
gray
eyes
looked
up
for
the
first
time
in
crayford
s
face
and
suddenly
became
dimmed
with
tears
if
i
only
dared
tell
you
she
murmured
i
hold
so
to
your
good
opinion
of
me
lucy
and
i
am
so
afraid
of
losing
crayford
s
manner
changed
her
eyes
rested
gravely
and
anxiously
on
clara
s
face
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
nothing
can
shake
my
affection
for
you
she
said
do
justice
my
child
to
your
old
friend
there
is
nobody
here
to
listen
to
what
we
say
open
your
heart
clara
i
see
you
are
in
trouble
and
i
want
to
comfort
clara
began
to
yield
in
other
words
she
began
to
make
conditions
will
you
promise
to
keep
what
i
tell
you
a
secret
from
every
living
creature
she
began
crayford
met
that
question
by
putting
a
question
on
her
side
does
every
living
creature
include
my
husband
your
husband
more
than
anybody
i
love
him
i
revere
him
he
is
so
noble
he
is
so
good
if
i
told
him
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
he
would
despise
me
own
it
plainly
lucy
if
i
am
asking
too
much
in
asking
you
to
keep
a
secret
from
your
nonsense
child
when
you
are
married
you
will
know
that
the
easiest
of
all
secrets
to
keep
is
a
secret
from
your
husband
i
give
you
my
promise
now
begin
clara
hesitated
painfully
i
don
t
know
how
to
begin
she
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
despair
the
words
won
t
come
to
then
i
must
help
you
do
you
feel
ill
tonight
do
you
feel
as
you
felt
that
day
when
you
were
with
my
sister
and
me
in
the
garden
oh
you
are
not
ill
you
are
not
really
affected
by
the
heat
and
yet
you
turn
as
pale
as
ashes
and
you
are
obliged
to
leave
the
quadrille
there
must
be
some
reason
for
there
is
a
reason
captain
helding
captain
helding
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
has
the
captain
to
do
with
it
he
told
you
something
about
the
he
said
the
was
expected
back
from
africa
well
and
what
of
that
is
there
anybody
in
whom
you
are
interested
coming
home
in
the
ship
somebody
whom
i
am
afraid
of
is
coming
home
in
the
crayford
s
magnificent
black
eyes
opened
wide
in
amazement
my
dear
clara
do
you
really
mean
what
you
say
wait
a
little
lucy
and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
we
must
go
back
if
i
am
to
make
you
understand
me
to
the
year
before
we
knew
each
other
to
the
last
year
of
my
father
s
life
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
my
father
moved
southward
for
the
sake
of
his
health
to
a
house
in
kent
that
was
lent
to
him
by
a
friend
no
my
dear
i
don
t
remember
ever
hearing
of
the
house
in
kent
tell
me
about
there
is
nothing
to
tell
except
this
the
new
house
was
near
a
fine
standing
in
its
own
park
the
owner
of
the
place
was
a
gentleman
named
wardour
he
too
was
one
of
my
father
s
kentish
friends
he
had
an
only
she
paused
and
played
nervously
with
her
fan
crayford
looked
at
her
attentively
clara
s
eyes
remained
fixed
on
her
fan
clara
said
no
more
what
was
the
son
s
name
asked
crayford
quietly
am
i
right
clara
in
suspecting
that
richard
wardour
admired
you
the
question
produced
its
intended
effect
the
question
helped
clara
to
go
on
i
hardly
knew
at
first
she
said
whether
he
admired
me
or
not
he
was
very
strange
in
his
ways
headstrong
terribly
headstrong
and
passionate
but
generous
and
affectionate
in
spite
of
his
faults
of
temper
can
you
understand
such
a
character
such
characters
exist
by
thousands
i
have
my
faults
of
temper
i
begin
to
like
richard
already
go
the
days
went
by
lucy
and
the
weeks
went
by
we
were
thrown
very
much
together
i
began
little
by
little
to
have
some
suspicion
of
the
and
richard
helped
to
confirm
your
suspicions
of
course
no
he
was
not
unhappily
for
me
he
was
not
that
sort
of
man
he
never
spoke
of
the
feeling
with
which
he
regarded
me
it
was
i
who
saw
it
i
couldn
t
help
seeing
it
i
did
all
i
could
to
show
that
i
was
willing
to
be
a
sister
to
him
and
that
i
could
never
be
anything
else
he
did
not
understand
me
or
he
would
not
i
can
t
say
would
not
is
the
most
likely
my
dear
go
it
might
have
been
as
you
say
there
was
a
strange
rough
bashfulness
about
him
he
confused
and
puzzled
me
he
never
spoke
out
he
seemed
to
treat
me
as
if
our
future
lives
had
been
provided
for
while
we
were
children
what
could
i
do
lucy
do
you
could
have
asked
your
father
to
end
the
difficulty
for
impossible
you
forget
what
i
have
just
told
you
my
father
was
suffering
at
that
time
under
the
illness
which
afterward
caused
his
death
he
was
quite
unfit
to
was
there
no
one
else
who
could
help
you
no
no
lady
in
whom
you
could
confide
i
had
acquaintances
among
the
ladies
in
the
neighborhood
i
had
no
what
did
you
do
then
nothing
i
hesitated
i
put
off
coming
to
an
explanation
with
him
unfortunately
until
it
was
too
what
do
you
mean
by
too
late
you
shall
hear
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
richard
wardour
is
in
the
navy
indeed
i
am
more
interested
in
him
than
ever
well
one
spring
day
richard
came
to
our
house
to
take
leave
of
us
before
he
joined
his
ship
i
thought
he
was
gone
and
i
went
into
the
next
room
it
was
my
own
and
it
opened
on
to
the
yes
richard
must
have
been
watching
me
he
suddenly
appeared
in
the
garden
without
waiting
for
me
to
invite
him
he
walked
into
the
room
i
was
a
little
startled
as
well
as
surprised
but
i
managed
to
hide
it
i
said
what
is
it
wardour
he
stepped
close
up
to
me
he
said
in
his
quick
rough
way
clara
i
am
going
to
the
african
coast
if
i
live
i
shall
come
back
promoted
and
we
both
know
what
will
happen
he
kissed
me
i
was
half
frightened
half
angry
before
i
could
compose
myself
to
say
a
word
he
was
out
in
the
garden
again
he
was
gone
i
ought
to
have
spoken
i
know
it
was
not
honorable
not
kind
toward
him
you
can
t
reproach
me
for
my
want
of
courage
and
frankness
more
bitterly
than
i
reproach
myself
my
dear
child
i
don
t
reproach
you
i
only
think
you
might
have
written
to
i
did
plainly
yes
i
told
him
in
so
many
words
that
he
was
deceiving
himself
and
that
i
could
never
marry
plain
enough
in
all
conscience
having
said
that
surely
you
are
not
to
blame
what
are
you
fretting
about
now
suppose
my
letter
has
never
reached
him
why
should
you
suppose
anything
of
the
sort
what
i
wrote
required
an
answer
lucy
for
an
answer
the
answer
has
never
come
what
is
the
plain
conclusion
my
letter
has
never
reached
him
and
the
is
expected
back
richard
wardour
is
returning
to
england
richard
wardour
will
claim
me
as
his
wife
you
wondered
just
now
if
i
really
meant
what
i
said
do
you
doubt
it
still
crayford
leaned
back
absently
in
her
chair
for
the
first
time
since
the
conversation
had
begun
she
let
a
question
pass
without
making
a
reply
the
truth
is
crayford
was
thinking
she
saw
clara
s
position
plainly
she
understood
the
disturbing
effect
of
it
on
the
mind
of
a
young
girl
still
making
all
allowances
she
felt
quite
at
a
loss
so
far
to
account
for
clara
s
excessive
agitation
her
quick
observing
faculty
had
just
detected
that
clara
s
face
showed
no
signs
of
relief
now
that
she
had
unburdened
herself
of
her
secret
there
was
something
clearly
under
the
surface
here
something
of
importance
that
still
remained
to
be
discovered
a
shrewd
doubt
crossed
crayford
s
mind
and
inspired
the
next
words
which
she
addressed
to
her
young
friend
my
dear
she
said
abruptly
have
you
told
me
all
clara
started
as
if
the
question
terrified
her
feeling
sure
that
she
now
had
the
clew
in
her
hand
crayford
deliberately
repeated
her
question
in
another
form
of
words
instead
of
answering
clara
suddenly
looked
up
at
the
same
moment
a
faint
flush
of
color
appeared
in
her
face
for
the
first
time
looking
up
instinctively
on
her
side
crayford
became
aware
of
the
presence
in
the
conservatory
of
a
young
gentleman
who
was
claiming
clara
as
his
partner
in
the
coming
waltz
crayford
fell
into
thinking
once
more
had
this
young
gentleman
she
asked
herself
anything
to
do
with
the
untold
end
of
the
story
was
this
the
true
secret
of
clara
burnham
s
terror
at
the
impending
return
of
richard
wardour
crayford
decided
on
putting
her
doubts
to
the
test
a
friend
of
yours
my
dear
she
asked
innocently
suppose
you
introduce
us
to
each
clara
confusedly
introduced
the
young
gentleman
mr
francis
aldersley
lucy
aldersley
belongs
to
the
arctic
attached
to
the
expedition
crayford
repeated
i
am
attached
to
the
expedition
too
in
my
way
i
had
better
introduce
myself
aldersley
as
clara
seems
to
have
forgotten
to
do
it
for
me
i
am
crayford
my
husband
is
lieutenant
crayford
of
the
do
you
belong
to
that
ship
i
have
not
the
honor
crayford
i
belong
to
the
crayford
s
superb
eyes
looked
shrewdly
backward
and
forward
between
clara
and
francis
aldersley
and
saw
the
untold
sequel
to
clara
s
story
the
young
officer
was
a
bright
handsome
lad
just
the
person
to
seriously
complicate
the
difficulty
with
richard
wardour
there
was
no
time
for
making
any
further
inquiries
the
band
had
begun
the
prelude
to
the
waltz
and
francis
aldersley
was
waiting
for
his
partner
with
a
word
of
apology
to
the
young
man
crayford
drew
clara
aside
for
a
moment
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
whisper
one
word
my
dear
before
you
return
to
the
it
may
sound
conceited
after
the
little
you
have
told
me
but
i
think
i
understand
your
position
better
than
you
do
yourself
do
you
want
to
hear
my
opinion
i
am
longing
to
hear
it
lucy
i
want
your
opinion
i
want
your
you
shall
have
both
in
the
plainest
and
fewest
words
first
my
opinion
you
have
no
choice
but
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
wardour
as
soon
as
he
returns
second
my
advice
if
you
wish
to
make
the
explanation
easy
to
both
sides
take
care
that
you
make
it
in
the
character
of
a
free
she
laid
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
three
words
and
looked
pointedly
at
francis
aldersley
as
she
pronounced
them
i
won
t
keep
you
from
your
partner
any
longer
clara
she
resumed
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
chapter
the
burden
on
clara
s
mind
weighs
on
it
more
heavily
than
ever
after
what
crayford
has
said
to
her
she
is
too
unhappy
to
feel
the
inspiriting
influence
of
the
dance
after
a
turn
round
the
room
she
complains
of
fatigue
francis
aldersley
looks
at
the
conservatory
still
as
invitingly
cool
and
empty
as
ever
leads
her
back
to
it
and
places
her
on
a
seat
among
the
shrubs
she
tries
very
feebly
to
dismiss
him
don
t
let
me
keep
you
from
dancing
he
seats
himself
by
her
side
and
feasts
his
eyes
on
the
lovely
downcast
face
that
dares
not
turn
toward
him
he
whispers
to
her
call
me
she
longs
to
call
him
frank
she
loves
him
with
all
her
heart
but
crayford
s
warning
words
are
still
in
her
mind
she
never
opens
her
lips
her
lover
moves
a
little
closer
and
asks
another
favor
men
are
all
alike
on
these
occasions
silence
invariably
encourages
them
to
try
again
clara
have
you
forgotten
what
i
said
at
the
concert
yesterday
may
i
say
it
again
no
we
sail
for
the
arctic
seas
i
may
not
return
for
years
don
t
send
me
away
without
hope
think
of
the
long
lonely
time
in
the
dark
north
make
it
a
happy
time
for
though
he
speaks
with
the
fervor
of
a
man
he
is
little
more
than
a
lad
he
is
only
twenty
years
old
and
he
is
going
to
risk
his
young
life
on
the
frozen
deep
clara
pities
him
as
she
never
pitied
any
human
creature
before
he
gently
takes
her
hand
she
tries
to
release
it
what
not
even
that
little
favor
on
the
last
night
her
faithful
heart
takes
his
part
in
spite
of
her
her
hand
remains
in
his
and
feels
its
soft
persuasive
pressure
she
is
a
lost
woman
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
now
clara
do
you
love
me
there
is
a
pause
she
shrinks
from
looking
at
him
she
trembles
with
strange
contradictory
sensations
of
pleasure
and
pain
his
arm
steals
round
her
he
repeats
his
question
in
a
whisper
his
lips
almost
touch
her
little
rosy
ear
as
he
says
it
again
do
you
love
me
she
closes
her
eyes
faintly
she
hears
nothing
but
those
words
feels
nothing
but
his
arm
round
her
forgets
crayford
s
warning
forgets
richard
wardour
himself
turns
suddenly
with
a
loving
woman
s
desperate
disregard
of
everything
but
her
love
nestles
her
head
on
his
bosom
and
answers
him
in
that
way
at
last
he
lifts
the
beautiful
drooping
head
their
lips
meet
in
their
first
kiss
they
are
both
in
heaven
it
is
clara
who
brings
them
back
to
earth
again
with
a
start
it
is
clara
who
says
oh
what
have
i
done
as
usual
when
it
is
too
late
frank
answers
the
question
you
have
made
me
happy
my
angel
now
when
i
come
back
i
come
back
to
make
you
my
she
shudders
she
remembers
richard
wardour
again
at
those
words
mind
she
says
nobody
is
to
know
we
are
engaged
till
i
permit
you
to
mention
it
remember
that
he
promises
to
remember
it
his
arm
tries
to
wind
round
her
once
more
no
she
is
mistress
of
herself
she
can
positively
dismiss
him
now
after
she
has
let
him
kiss
her
go
she
says
i
want
to
see
crayford
find
her
say
i
am
here
waiting
to
speak
to
her
go
at
once
frank
for
my
sake
there
is
no
alternative
but
to
obey
her
his
eyes
drink
a
last
draught
of
her
beauty
he
hurries
away
on
his
errand
the
happiest
man
in
the
room
five
minutes
since
she
was
only
his
partner
in
the
dance
he
has
spoken
and
she
has
pledged
herself
to
be
his
partner
for
life
chapter
it
was
not
easy
to
find
crayford
in
the
crowd
searching
here
and
searching
there
frank
became
conscious
of
a
stranger
who
appeared
to
be
looking
for
somebody
on
his
side
he
was
a
dark
man
dressed
in
a
shabby
old
naval
officer
s
uniform
his
manner
strikingly
resolute
and
was
unmistakably
the
manner
of
a
gentleman
he
wound
his
way
slowly
through
the
crowd
stopping
to
look
at
every
lady
whom
he
passed
and
then
looking
away
again
with
a
frown
little
by
little
he
approached
the
conservatory
entered
it
after
a
moment
s
reflection
detected
the
glimmer
of
a
white
dress
in
the
distance
through
the
shrubs
and
flowers
advanced
to
get
a
nearer
view
of
the
lady
and
burst
into
clara
s
presence
with
a
cry
of
delight
she
sprang
to
her
feet
she
stood
before
him
speechless
motionless
struck
to
stone
all
her
life
was
in
her
eyes
the
eyes
which
told
her
she
was
looking
at
richard
wardour
he
was
the
first
to
speak
i
am
sorry
i
startled
you
my
darling
i
forgot
everything
but
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
again
we
only
reached
our
moorings
two
hours
since
i
was
some
time
inquiring
after
you
and
some
time
getting
my
ticket
when
they
told
me
you
were
at
the
ball
wish
me
joy
clara
i
am
promoted
i
have
come
back
to
make
you
my
a
momentary
change
passed
over
the
blank
terror
of
her
face
her
color
rose
faintly
her
lips
moved
she
abruptly
put
a
question
to
him
did
you
get
my
letter
he
started
a
letter
from
you
i
never
received
the
momentary
animation
died
out
of
her
face
again
she
drew
back
from
him
and
dropped
into
a
chair
he
advanced
toward
her
astonished
and
alarmed
she
shrank
in
the
chair
shrank
as
if
she
was
frightened
of
him
clara
you
have
not
even
shaken
hands
with
me
what
does
it
mean
he
paused
waiting
and
watching
her
she
made
no
reply
a
flash
of
the
quick
temper
in
him
leaped
up
in
his
eyes
he
repeated
his
last
words
in
louder
and
sterner
tones
what
does
it
mean
she
replied
this
time
his
tone
had
hurt
her
his
tone
had
roused
her
sinking
courage
it
means
wardour
that
you
have
been
mistaken
from
the
how
have
i
been
mistaken
you
have
been
under
a
wrong
impression
and
you
have
given
me
no
opportunity
of
setting
you
in
what
way
have
i
been
wrong
you
have
been
too
hasty
and
too
confident
about
yourself
and
about
me
you
have
entirely
misunderstood
me
i
am
grieved
to
distress
you
but
for
your
sake
i
must
speak
plainly
i
am
your
friend
always
wardour
i
can
never
be
your
he
mechanically
repeated
the
last
words
he
seemed
to
doubt
whether
he
had
heard
her
aright
you
can
never
be
my
wife
never
why
there
was
no
answer
she
was
incapable
of
telling
him
a
falsehood
she
was
ashamed
to
tell
him
the
truth
he
stooped
over
her
and
suddenly
possessed
himself
of
her
hand
holding
her
hand
firmly
he
stooped
a
little
lower
searching
for
the
signs
which
might
answer
him
in
her
face
his
own
face
darkened
slowly
while
he
looked
he
was
beginning
to
suspect
her
and
he
acknowledged
it
in
his
next
words
something
has
changed
you
toward
me
clara
somebody
has
influenced
you
against
me
is
it
you
force
me
to
ask
the
question
is
it
some
other
man
you
have
no
right
to
ask
me
he
went
on
without
noticing
what
she
had
said
to
him
has
that
other
man
come
between
you
and
me
i
speak
plainly
on
my
side
speak
plainly
on
i
spoken
i
have
nothing
more
to
there
was
a
pause
she
saw
the
warning
light
which
told
of
the
fire
within
him
growing
brighter
and
brighter
in
his
eyes
she
felt
his
grasp
strengthening
on
her
hand
he
appealed
to
her
for
the
last
time
reflect
he
said
reflect
before
it
is
too
late
your
silence
will
not
serve
you
if
you
persist
in
not
answering
me
i
shall
take
your
silence
as
a
confession
do
you
hear
me
i
hear
clara
burnham
i
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
clara
burnham
i
insist
on
the
truth
are
you
false
to
me
she
resented
that
searching
question
with
a
woman
s
keen
sense
of
the
insult
that
is
implied
in
doubting
her
to
her
face
mr
wardour
you
forget
yourself
when
you
call
me
to
account
in
that
way
i
never
encouraged
you
i
never
gave
you
promise
or
pledge
he
passionately
interrupted
her
before
she
could
say
more
you
have
engaged
yourself
in
my
absence
your
words
own
it
your
looks
own
it
you
have
engaged
yourself
to
another
man
if
i
engaged
myself
what
right
have
you
to
complain
of
it
she
answered
firmly
what
right
have
you
to
control
my
actions
the
next
words
died
away
on
her
lips
he
suddenly
dropped
her
hand
a
marked
change
appeared
in
the
expression
of
his
eyes
a
change
which
told
her
of
the
terrible
passions
that
she
had
let
loose
in
him
she
read
dimly
read
something
in
his
face
which
made
her
tremble
not
for
herself
but
for
frank
little
by
little
the
dark
color
faded
out
of
his
face
his
deep
voice
dropped
suddenly
to
a
low
and
quiet
tone
as
he
spoke
the
parting
words
say
no
more
miss
burnham

have
said
enough
i
am
answered

he
paused
and
stepping
close
up
to
her
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
the
time
may
come
he
said
when
i
shall
forgive
you
but
the
man
who
has
robbed
me
of
you
shall
rue
the
day
when
you
and

left

few
minutes
later
crayford
entering
the
conservatory
was
met
by
one
of
the
attendants
at
the
ball
the
man
stopped
as
if
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
what
do
you
want

asked

pardon

room
on
her
way
out

anxious
to

how
her
young
friend

the
night
to
her
astonishment

found

if

moment

ease
until
i
have
seen
frank
with
my
own
eyes
safe
in
the
boat
which
takes
him
to
his
ship
you
have
got
your
bonnet
on
what
are
we
stopping
here
for
come
or
i
shall
go
without
you
look
at
the
clock
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
it
was
useless
to
contend
with
her
crayford
yielded
the
two
women
left
the
house
together
the
as
crayford
had
predicted
was
thronged
with
spectators
not
only
the
relatives
and
friends
of
the
arctic
voyagers
but
strangers
as
well
had
assembled
in
large
numbers
to
see
the
ships
sail
clara
s
eyes
wandered
affrightedly
hither
and
thither
among
the
strange
faces
in
the
crowd
searching
for
the
one
face
that
she
dreaded
to
see
and
not
finding
it
so
completely
were
her
nerves
unstrung
that
she
started
with
a
cry
of
alarm
on
suddenly
hearing
frank
s
voice
behind
her
the
s
boats
are
waiting
he
said
i
must
go
darling
how
pale
you
are
looking
clara
are
you
ill
she
never
answered
she
questioned
him
with
wild
eyes
and
trembling
lips
has
anything
happened
to
you
frank
anything
out
of
the
common
frank
laughed
at
the
strange
question
anything
out
of
the
common
he
repeated
nothing
that
i
know
of
except
sailing
for
the
arctic
seas
that
s
out
of
the
common
i
suppose
isn
t
it
has
anybody
spoken
to
you
since
last
night
has
any
stranger
followed
you
in
the
street
frank
turned
in
blank
amazement
to
crayford
what
on
earth
does
she
mean
crayford
s
lively
invention
supplied
her
with
an
answer
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
do
you
believe
in
dreams
frank
of
course
you
don
t
clara
has
been
dreaming
about
you
and
clara
is
foolish
enough
to
believe
in
dreams
that
s
all
it
s
not
worth
talking
about
hark
they
are
calling
you
say
or
you
will
be
too
late
for
the
frank
took
clara
s
hand
long
afterward
in
the
dark
arctic
days
in
the
dreary
arctic
nights
he
remembered
how
coldly
and
how
passively
that
hand
lay
in
his
courage
clara
he
said
gayly
a
sailor
s
sweetheart
must
accustom
herself
to
partings
the
time
will
soon
pass
my
darling
my
wife
he
kissed
the
cold
hand
he
looked
his
last
for
many
a
long
year
perhaps
at
the
pale
and
beautiful
face
how
she
loves
me
he
thought
how
the
parting
distresses
her
he
still
held
her
hand
he
would
have
lingered
longer
if
crayford
had
not
wisely
waived
all
ceremony
and
pushed
him
away
the
two
ladies
followed
him
at
a
safe
distance
through
the
crowd
and
saw
him
step
into
the
boat
the
oars
struck
the
water
frank
waved
his
cap
to
clara
in
a
moment
more
a
vessel
at
anchor
hid
the
boat
from
view
they
had
seen
the
last
of
him
on
his
way
to
the
frozen
deep
no
richard
wardour
in
the
boat
said
crayford
no
richard
wardour
on
the
shore
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
dear
never
be
foolish
enough
to
believe
in
presentiments
clara
s
eyes
still
wandered
suspiciously
to
and
fro
among
the
crowd
are
you
not
satisfied
yet
asked
crayford
no
clara
answered
i
am
not
satisfied
what
still
looking
for
him
this
is
really
too
absurd
here
is
my
husband
coming
i
shall
tell
him
to
call
a
cab
and
send
you
clara
drew
back
a
few
steps
i
won
t
be
in
the
way
lucy
while
you
are
taking
leave
of
your
good
husband
she
said
i
will
wait
wait
here
what
for
for
something
which
i
may
yet
see
or
for
something
which
i
may
still
richard
wardour
richard
crayford
turned
to
her
husband
without
another
word
clara
s
infatuation
was
beyond
the
reach
of
remonstrance
the
boats
of
the
took
the
place
at
the
vacated
by
the
boats
of
the
a
burst
of
cheering
among
the
outer
ranks
of
the
crowd
announced
the
arrival
of
the
commander
of
the
expedition
on
the
scene
captain
helding
appeared
looking
right
and
left
for
his
first
lieutenant
finding
crayford
with
his
wife
the
captain
made
his
apologies
for
interfering
with
his
best
grace
give
him
up
to
his
professional
duties
for
one
minute
crayford
and
you
shall
have
him
back
again
for
half
an
hour
the
arctic
expedition
is
to
blame
my
dear
lady
not
the
captain
for
parting
man
and
wife
in
crayford
s
place
i
should
have
left
it
to
the
bachelors
to
find
the
northwest
passage
and
have
stopped
at
home
with
you
excusing
himself
in
those
bluntly
complimentary
terms
captain
helding
drew
the
lieutenant
aside
a
few
steps
accidentally
taking
a
direction
that
led
the
two
officers
close
to
the
place
at
which
clara
was
standing
both
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
were
too
completely
absorbed
in
their
professional
business
to
notice
her
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
had
the
faintest
suspicion
that
she
could
and
did
hear
every
word
of
the
talk
that
passed
between
them
you
received
my
note
this
morning
the
captain
began
certainly
captain
helding
or
i
should
have
been
on
board
the
ship
before
i
am
going
on
board
myself
at
once
the
captain
proceeded
but
i
must
ask
you
to
keep
your
boat
waiting
for
half
an
hour
more
you
will
be
all
the
longer
with
your
wife
you
know
i
thought
of
that
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
captain
helding
i
suppose
there
is
some
other
reason
for
inverting
the
customary
order
of
things
and
keeping
the
lieutenant
on
shore
after
the
captain
is
on
board
quite
true
there
another
reason
i
want
you
to
wait
for
a
volunteer
who
has
just
joined
a
volunteer
yes
he
has
his
outfit
to
get
in
a
hurry
and
he
may
be
half
an
hour
it
s
rather
a
sudden
appointment
isn
t
it
no
doubt
very
and
pardon
me
it
s
rather
a
long
time
as
we
are
situated
to
keep
the
ships
waiting
for
one
man
quite
true
again
but
a
man
who
is
worth
having
is
worth
waiting
for
this
man
is
worth
having
this
man
is
worth
his
weight
in
gold
to
such
an
expedition
as
ours
seasoned
to
all
climates
and
all
fatigues
a
strong
fellow
a
brave
fellow
a
clever
fellow
in
short
an
excellent
officer
i
know
him
well
or
i
should
never
have
taken
him
the
country
gets
plenty
of
work
out
of
my
new
volunteer
crayford
he
only
returned
yesterday
from
foreign
he
only
returned
yesterday
from
foreign
service
and
he
volunteers
this
morning
to
join
the
arctic
expedition
you
astonish
i
dare
say
i
do
you
can
t
be
more
astonished
than
i
was
when
he
presented
himself
at
my
hotel
and
told
me
what
he
wanted
why
my
good
fellow
you
have
just
got
home
i
said
are
you
weary
of
your
freedom
after
only
a
few
hours
experience
of
it
his
answer
rather
startled
me
he
said
i
am
weary
of
my
life
sir
i
have
come
home
and
found
a
trouble
to
welcome
me
which
goes
near
to
break
my
heart
if
i
don
t
take
refuge
in
absence
and
hard
work
i
am
a
lost
man
will
you
give
me
a
refuge
that
s
what
he
said
crayford
word
for
did
you
ask
him
to
explain
himself
further
not
i
i
knew
his
value
and
i
took
the
poor
devil
on
the
spot
without
pestering
him
with
any
more
questions
no
need
to
ask
him
to
explain
himself
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
in
these
cases
the
old
story
my
good
friend
there
s
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
it
of
crayford
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
husband
as
patiently
as
she
could
was
startled
by
feeling
a
hand
suddenly
laid
on
her
shoulder
she
looked
round
and
confronted
clara
her
first
feeling
of
surprise
changed
instantly
to
alarm
clara
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot

is
the
matter

has
frightened
you

dear

over
my
blanket
every
time
i
have
snored
i
ve
frozen
something
when
a
man
gets
the
cold
into
him
to
that
extent
that
he
ices
his

bed

much
longer
never

crayford
tapped
the
saucepan
of
bones
impatiently
john
want
lowered
himself
to
the
floor
grumbling
all
the
way
by
a
rope
attached
to
the
rafters
at
his
bed
head
instead
of
approaching
his
superior
officer
and
his
saucepan
he
hobbled
shivering
to
the
and
held
his
chin
as
close
as
he
possibly
could
over
the
fire
crayford
looked
after
him
halloo
what
are
you
doing
there
thawing
my
beard
come
here
directly
and
set
to
work
on
these
john
want
remained
immovably
attached
to
the
holding
something
else
over
the
fire
crayford
began
to
lose
his
temper
what
the
devil
are
you
about
now
thawing
my
watch
sir
it
s
been
under
my
pillow
all
night
and
the
cold
has
stopped
it
cheerful
wholesome
bracing
sort
of
climate
to
live
in
isn
t
it
sir
never
mind
don
t
no
we
all
know
that
look
here
are
these
bones
pounded
small
enough
john
want
suddenly
approached
the
lieutenant
and
looked
at
him
with
an
appearance
of
the
deepest
interest
you
ll
excuse
me
sir
he
said
how
very
hollow
your
voice
sounds
this
morning
never
mind
my
voice
the
bones
the
bones
yes

bones
they

take
a
trifle
more
pounding
i
ll
do
my
best
with
them
sir
for
your
what
do
you
mean
john
want
shook
his
head
and
looked
at
crayford
with
a
dreary
smile
i
don
t
think
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
making
much
more
bone
soup
for
you
sir
do
you
think
yourself
you
ll
last
long
sir
i
don
t
saving
your
presence
i
think
about
another
week
or
ten
days
will
do
for
us
all
never
mind
don
t
he
poured
the
bones
into
the
mortar
and
began
to
pound
them
under
protest
at
the
same
moment
a
sailor
appeared
entering
from
the
inner
hut
a
message
from
captain
ebsworth
well
the
captain
is
worse
than
ever
with
his
freezing
pains
sir
he
wants
to
see
you
i
will
go
at
once
rouse
the
answering
in
those
terms
crayford
returned
to
the
inner
hut
followed
by
the
sailor
john
want
shook
his
head
again
and
smiled
more
drearily
than
ever
rouse
the
doctor
he
repeated
suppose
the
doctor
should
be
frozen
he
hadn
t
a
ha
porth
of
warmth
in
him
last
night
and
his
voice
sounded
like
a
whisper
in
a
will
the
bones
do
now
yes
the
bones
will
do
now
into
the
saucepan
with
you
cried
john
want
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
flavor
the
hot
water
if
you
can
when
i
remember
that
i
was
once
an
apprentice
at
a
s
when
i
think
of
the
gallons
of
that
this
hand
has
stirred
up
in
a
jolly
hot
kitchen
and
when
i
find
myself
mixing
bones
and
hot
water
for
soup
and
turning
into
ice
as
fast
as
i
can
if
i
wasn
t
of
a
cheerful
disposition
i
should
feel
inclined
to
grumble
john
want
john
want
whatever
had
you
done
with
your
natural
senses
when
you
made
up
your
mind
to
go
to
sea
a
new
voice
hailed
the
cook
speaking
from
one
of
the
in
the
side
of
the
hut
it
was
the
voice
of
francis
aldersley
who
s
that
croaking
over
the
fire
croaking
repeated
john
want
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
considered
himself
the
object
of
a
gratuitous
insult
croaking
you
don
t
find
your
own
voice
at
all
altered
for
the
worse
do
you
frank
i
don
t
give
john
proceeded
speaking
confidentially
to
himself
more
than
six
hours
to
last
he
s
one
of
your
what
are
you
doing
there
asked
frank
i
m
making
bone
soup
sir
and
wondering
why
i
ever
went
to
well
and
why
did
you
go
to
sea
i
m
not
certain
frank
sometimes
i
think
it
was
natural
perversity
sometimes
i
think
it
was
false
pride
at
getting
over
sometimes
i
think
it
was
reading
robinson
crusoe
and
books
warning
of
me
to
go
to
frank
laughed
you
re
an
odd
fellow
what
do
you
mean
by
false
pride
at
getting
over
did
you
get
over
in
some
new
way
john
want
s
dismal
face
brightened
in
spite
of
himself
frank
had
recalled
to
the
cook
s
memory
one
of
the
noteworthy
passages
in
the
cook
s
life
that
s
it
sir
he
said
if
ever
a
man

in
a
new
way
yet

i
saw

nasty
lopp

moment

says
the
captain
never
you
give
in
to
your
stomach
and
your
stomach
will
end
in
giving
in
to
having
stated
the
moral
purpose
of
his
story
in
those
unanswerable
words
john
want
took
himself
and
his
saucepan
into
the
kitchen
a
moment
later
crayford
returned
to
the
hut
and
astonished
frank
aldersley
by
an
unexpected
question
have
you
anything
in
your
berth
frank
that
you
set
a
value
on
nothing
that
i
set
the
smallest
value
on
when
i
am
out
of
it
he
replied
what
does
your
question
mean
we
are
almost
as
short
of
fuel
as
we
are
of
provisions
crayford
proceeded
your
berth
will
make
good
firing
i
have
directed
bateson
to
be
here
in
ten
minutes
with
his
very
attentive
and
considerate
on
your
part
said
frank
what
is
to
become
of
me
if
you
please
when
bateson
has
chopped
my
bed
into
can
t
you
guess
i
suppose
the
cold
has
stupefied
me
the
riddle
is
beyond
my
reading
suppose
you
give
me
a
hint
certainly
there
will
be
beds
to
spare
soon
there
is
to
be
a
change
at
last
in
our
wretched
lives
here
do
you
see
it
now
frank
s
eyes
sparkled
he
sprang
out
of
his
berth
and
waved
his
fur
cap
in
triumph
see
it
he
exclaimed
of
course
i
do
the
exploring
party
is
to
start
at
last
do
i
go
with
the
expedition
it
is
not
very
long
since
you
were
in
the
doctor
s
hands
frank
said
crayford
kindly
i
doubt
if
you
are
strong
enough
yet
to
make
one
of
the
exploring
strong
enough
or
not
returned
frank
any
risk
is
better
than
pining
and
perishing
here
put
me
down
crayford
among
those
who
volunteer
to
volunteers
will
not
be
accepted
in
this
case
said
crayford
captain
helding
and
captain
ebsworth
see
serious
objections
as
we
are
situated
to
that
method
of
do
they
mean
to
keep
the
appointments
in
their
own
hands
asked
frank
i
for
one
object
to
wait
a
little
said
crayford
you
were
playing
backgammon
the
other
day
with
one
of
the
officers
does
the
board
belong
to
him
or
to
you
it
belongs
to
me
i
have
got
it
in
my
locker
here
what
do
you
want
with
it
i
want
the
dice
and
the
box
for
casting
lots
the
captains
have
arranged
most
wisely
as
i
think
that
chance
shall
decide
among
us
who
goes
with
the
expedition
and
who
stays
behind
in
the
huts
the
officers
and
crew
of
the
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
to
cast
the
lots
neither
you
nor
any
one
can
object
to
that
way
of
deciding
among
us
officers
and
men
alike
take
their
chance
together
nobody
can
i
am
quite
satisfied
said
frank
but
i
know
of
one
man
among
the
officers
who
is
sure
to
make
who
is
the
man
you
know
him
well
enough
too
the
bear
of
the
expeditions
richard
frank
frank
you
have
a
bad
habit
of
letting
your
tongue
run
away
with
you
don
t
repeat
that
stupid
nickname
when
you
talk
of
my
good
friend
richard
your
good
friend
crayford
your
liking
for
that
man
amazes
crayford
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
frank
s
shoulder
of
all
the
officers
of
the
crayford
s
favorite
was
frank
why
should
it
amaze
you
he
asked
what
opportunities
have
you
had
of
judging
you
and
wardour
have
always
belonged
to
different
ships
i
have
never
seen
you
in
wardour
s
society
for
five
minutes
together
how
can
form
a
fair
estimate
of
his
character
i
take
the
general
estimate
of
his
character
frank
answered
he
has
got
his
nickname
because
he
is
the
most
unpopular
man
in
his
ship
nobody
likes
him
there
must
be
some
reason
for
there
is
only
one
reason
for
it
crayford
rejoined
nobody
understands
richard
wardour
i
am
not
talking
at
random
remember
i
sailed
from
england
with
him
in
the
and
i
was
only
transferred
to
the
long
after
we
were
locked
up
in
the
ice
i
was
richard
wardour
s
companion
on
board
ship
for
months
and
i
learned
there
to
do
him
justice
under
all
his
outward
defects
i
tell
you
there
beats
a
great
and
generous
heart
suspend
your
opinion
my
lad
until
you
know
my
friend
as
well
as
i
do
no
more
of
this
now
give
me
the
dice
and
the
frank
opened
his
locker
at
the
same
moment
the
silence
of
the
snowy
waste
outside
was
broken
by
a
shouting
of
voices
hailing
the
hut
ahoy
chapter
the
sailor
on
watch
opened
the
outer
door
there
plodding
over
the
ghastly
white
snow
were
the
officers
of
the
approaching
the
hut
there
scattered
under
the
merciless
black
sky
were
the
crew
with
the
dogs
and
the
sledges
waiting
the
word
which
was
to
start
them
on
their
perilous
and
doubtful
journey
captain
helding
of
the
accompanied
by
his
officers
entered
the
hut
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
a
change
behind
them
lounging
in
slowly
by
himself
was
a
dark
sullen
man
he
neither
spoke
nor
offered
his
hand
to
anybody
he
was
the
one
person
present
who
seemed
to
be
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
fate
in
store
for
him
this
was
the
man
whom
his
brother
officers
had
nicknamed
the
bear
of
the
expedition
in
other
words
richard
wardour
crayford
advanced
to
welcome
captain
helding
frank
remembering
the
friendly
reproof
which
he
had
just
received
passed
over
the
other
officers
of
the
and
made
a
special
effort
to
be
civil
to
crayford
s
friend
wardour
he
said
we
may
congratulate
each
other
on
the
chance
of
leaving
this
horrible
may
think
it
horrible
wardour
retorted
i
like
like
it
good
heavens
why
because
there
are
no
women
frank
turned
to
his
brother
officers
without
making
any
further
advances
in
the
direction
of
richard
wardour
the
bear
of
the
expedition
was
more
unapproachable
than
ever
in
the
meantime
the
hut
had
become
thronged
by
the
officers
and
men
of
the
two
ships
captain
helding
standing
in
the
midst
of
them
with
crayford
by
his
side
proceeded
to
explain
the
purpose
of
the
contemplated
expedition
to
the
audience
which
surrounded
him
he
began
in
these
words
brother
officers
and
men
of
the
and
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
very
briefly
the
reasons
which
have
decided
captain
ebsworth
and
myself
on
dispatching
an
exploring
party
in
search
of
help
without
recalling
all
the
hardships
we
have
suffered
for
the
last
two
years
the
destruction
first
of
one
of
our
ships
then
of
the
other
the
death
of
some
of
our
bravest
and
best
companions
the
vain
battles
we
have
been
fighting
with
the
ice
and
snow
and
boundless
desolation
of
these
inhospitable
regions
without
dwelling
on
these
things
it
is
my
duty
to
remind
you
that
this
the
last
place
in
which
we
have
taken
refuge
is
far
beyond
the
track
of
any
previous
expedition
and
that
consequently
our
chance
of
being
discovered
by
any
rescuing
parties
that
may
be
sent
to
look
after
us
is
to
say
the
least
of
it
a
chance
of
the
most
uncertain
kind
you
all
agree
with
me
gentlemen
so
far
the
officers
with
the
exception
of
wardour
who
stood
apart
in
sullen
silence
all
agreed
so
far
the
captain
went
on
it
is
therefore
urgently
necessary
that
we
should
make
another
and
probably
a
last
effort
to
extricate
ourselves
the
winter
is
not
far
off
game
is
getting
scarcer
and
scarcer
our
stock
of
provisions
is
running
low
and
the
sick
especially
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
sick
in
the
s
hut
are
increasing
in
number
day
by
day
we
must
look
to
our
own
lives
and
to
the
lives
of
those
who
are
dependent
on
us
and
we
have
no
time
to
the
officers
echoed
the
words
cheerfully
right
right
no
time
to
captain
helding
resumed
the
plan
proposed
is
that
a
detachment
of
the
officers
and
men
among
us
should
set
forth
this
very
day
and
make
another
effort
to
reach
the
nearest
inhabited
settlements
from
which
help
and
provisions
may
be
dispatched
to
those
who
remain
here
the
new
direction
to
be
taken
and
the
various
precautions
to
be
adopted
are
all
drawn
out
ready
the
only
question
now
before
us
is
who
is
to
stop
here
and
who
is
to
undertake
the
journey
the
officers
answered
the
question
with
one
accord
volunteers
the
men
echoed
their
officers
ay
ay
wardour
still
preserved
his
sullen
silence
crayford
noticed
him
standing
apart
from
the
rest
and
appealed
to
him
personally
do
you
say
nothing
he
asked
nothing
wardour
answered
go
or
stay
it
s
all
one
to
i
hope
you
don
t
really
mean
that
said
crayford
i
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
captain
helding
answered
the
general
suggestion
in
favor
of
volunteering
by
a
question
which
instantly
checked
the
rising
enthusiasm
of
the
meeting
well
he
said
suppose
we
say
volunteers
who
volunteers
to
stop
in
the
huts
there
was
a
dead
silence
the
officers
and
men
looked
at
each
other
confusedly
the
captain
continued
you
see
we
can
t
settle
it
by
volunteering
you
all
want
to
go
every
man
among
us
who
has
the
use
of
his
limbs
naturally
wants
to
go
but
what
is
to
become
of
those
who
have
not
got
the
use
of
their
limbs
some
of
us
must
stay
here
and
take
care
of
the
everybody
admitted
that
this

kept
silence

of
the
and
your

crayford

wardour
persisted
in
letting
the
dice
fall
out
carelessly
just
as
they
lay
in
the
box
not
i
he
muttered
to
himself
i
ve
done
with
saying
those
words
he
threw
down
the
empty
box
and
seated
himself
on
the
nearest
chest
without
looking
to
see
how
the
dice
had
fallen
crayford
examined
them
six
he
exclaimed
there

a
second
chance
in
spite
of
yourself
you
are
neither
under
nor
over
you
throw

growled
the

not

trouble
of

suddenly
looked
at
frank
you
you
have
got
what
the
women
call
a
lucky
frank

to
crayford

crayford

wardour

hurrah

said
wardour
the
chance

yours

thriven
on
my
ill
he
rose
as
he
spoke
to
leave
the
hut
crayford
stopped
him
have
you
anything
particular
to
do
richard
what
has
anybody
to
do
here
wait
a
little
then
i
want
to
speak
to
you
when
this
business
is
are
you
going
to
give
me
any
more
good
advice
don
t
look
at
me
in
that
sour
way
richard
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
about
something
which
concerns
wardour
yielded
without
a
word
more
he
returned
to
his
chest
and
cynically
composed
himself
to
slumber
the
casting
of
the
lots
went
on
rapidly
among
the
officers
and
men
in
another
chance
had
decided
the
question
of
go
or
stay
for
all
alike
the
men
left
the
hut
the
officers
entered
the
inner
apartment
for
a
last
conference
with
the
captain
of
the
wardour
and
crayford
were
left
together
alone
chapter
crayford
touched
his
friend
on
the
shoulder
to
rouse
him
wardour
looked
up
impatiently
with
a
frown
i
was
just
asleep
he
said
why
do
you
wake
me
look
round
you
richard
we
are
well
and
what
of
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
privately
and
this
is
my
opportunity
you
have
disappointed
and
surprised
me
why
did
you
say
it
was
all
one
to
you
whether
you
went
or
stayed
why
are
you
the
only
man
among
us
who
seems
to
be
perfectly
indifferent
whether
we
are
rescued
or
not
can
a
man
always
give
a
reason
for
what
is
strange
in
his
manner
or
his
words
wardour
retorted
he
can
try
said
crayford
quietly
when
his
friend
asks
wardour
s
manner
softened
that
s
true
he
said
i
try
do
you
remember
the
first
night
at
sea
when
we
sailed
from
england
in
the
as
well
as
if
it
was
a
calm
still
night
the
other
went
on
thoughtfully
no
clouds
no
stars
nothing
in
the
sky
but
the
broad
moon
and
hardly
a
ripple
to
break
the
path
of
light
she
made
in
the
quiet
water
mine
was
the
middle
watch
that
night
you
came
on
deck
and
found
me
alone
he
stopped
crayford
took
his
hand
and
finished
the
sentence
for
him
alone
and
in
the
last
i
shall
ever
shed
wardour
added
bitterly
don
t
say
that
there
are
times
when
a
man
is
to
be
pitied
indeed
if
he
can
shed
no
tears
go
on
wardour
proceeded
still
following
the
old
recollections
still
preserving
his
gentler
tones
i
should
have
quarreled
with
any
other
man
who
had
surprised
me
at
that
moment
he
said
there
was
something
i
suppose
in
your
voice
when
you
asked
my
pardon
for
disturbing
me
that
softened
my
heart
i
told
you
i
had
met
with
a
disappointment
which
had
broken
me
for
life
there
was
no
need
to
explain
further
the
only
hopeless
wretchedness
in
this
world
is
the
wretchedness
that
women
and
the
only
unalloyed
happiness
said
crayford
the
happiness
that
women
that
may
be
your
experience
of
them
wardour
answered
mine
is
different
all
the
devotion
the
patience
the
humility
the
worship
that
there
is
in
man
i
laid
at
the
feet
of
a
woman
she
accepted
the
offering
as
women
do
accepted
it
easily
gracefully
unfeelingly
accepted
it
as
a
matter
of
course
i
left
england
to
win
a
high
place
in
my
profession
before
i
dared
to
win
i
braved
danger
and
faced
death
i
staked
my
life
in
the
fever
swamps
of
africa
to
gain
the
promotion
that
i
only
desired
for
her
sake
and
gained
it
i
came
back
to
give
her
all
and
to
ask
nothing
in
return
but
to
rest
my
weary
heart
in
the
sunshine
of
her
smile
and
her
own
lips
the
lips
i
had
kissed
at
parting
told
me
that
another
man
had
robbed
me
of
her
i
spoke
but
few
words
when
i
heard
that
confession
and
left
her
forever
the
time
may
come
i
told
her
when
i
shall
forgive
but
the
man
who
has
robbed
me
of
you
shall
rue
the
day
when
you
and
he
first
don
t
ask
me
who
he
was
i
have
yet
to
discover
him
the
treachery
had
been
kept
secret
nobody
could
tell
me
where
to
find
him
nobody
could
tell
me
who
he
was
what
did
it
matter
when
i
had
lived
out
the
first
agony
i
could
rely
on
myself
i
could
be
patient
and
bide
my
your
time
what
time
the
time
when
i
and
that
man
shall
meet
face
to
face
i
knew
it
then
i
know
it
now
it
was
written
on
my
heart
then
it
is
written
on
my
heart
now
we
two
shall
meet
and
know
each
other
with
that
conviction
strong
within
me
i
volunteered
for
this
service
as
i
would
have
volunteered
for
anything
that
set
work
and
hardship
and
danger
like
ramparts
between
my
misery
and
me
with
that
conviction
strong
within
me
still
i
tell
you
it
is
no
matter
whether
i
stay
here
with
the
sick
or
go
hence
with
the
strong
i
shall
live
till
i
have
met
that
man
there
is
a
day
of
reckoning
appointed
between
us
here
in
the
freezing
cold
or
away
in
the
deadly
heat
in
battle
or
in
shipwreck
in
the
face
of
starvation
under
the
shadow
of
pestilence
i
though
hundreds
are
falling
round
me
i
shall
live
live
for
the
coming
of
one
day
live
for
the
meeting
with
one
man
he
stopped
trembling
body
and
soul
under
the
hold
that
his
own
terrible
superstition
had
fastened
on
him
crayford
drew
back
in
silent
horror
wardour
noticed
the
action
he
resented
it
he
appealed
in
defense
of
his
one
cherished
conviction
to
crayford
s
own
experience
of
him
look
at
me
he
cried
look
how
i
have
lived
and
thriven
with
the
gnawing
at
me
at
home
and
the
winds
of
the
icy
north
whistling
round
me
here
i
am
the
strongest
man
among
you
why
i
have
fought
through
hardships
that
have
laid
the
men
of
all
our
party
on
their
backs
why
what
have
done
that
my
life
should
throb
as
bravely
through
every
vein
in
my
body
at
this
minute
and
in
this
deadly
place
as
ever
it
did
in
the
wholesome
breezes
of
home
what
am
i
preserved
for
i
tell
you
again
for
the
coming
of
one
day
for
the
meeting
with
one
he
paused
once
more
this
time
crayford
spoke
richard
he
said
since
we
first
met
i
have
believed
in
your
better
nature
against
all
outward
appearance
i
have
believed
in
you
firmly
truly
as
your
brother
might
you
are
putting
that
belief
to
a
hard
test
if
your
enemy
had
told
me
that
you
had
ever
talked
as
you
talk
now
that
you
had
ever
looked
as
you
look
now
i
would
have
turned
my
back
on
him
as
the
utterer
of
a
vile
calumny
against
a
just
a
brave
an
upright
man
oh
my
friend
my
friend
if
ever
i
have
deserved
well
of
you
put
away
these
thoughts
from
your
heart
face
me
again
with
the
stainless
look
of
a
man
who
has
trampled
under
his
feet
the
bloody
superstitions
of
revenge
and
knows
them
no
more
never
never
let
the
time
come
when
i
can
not
offer
you
my
hand
as
i
offer
it
now
to
the
man
i
can
still
admire
to
the
brother
i
can
still
love
the
heart
that
no
other
voice
could
touch
felt
that
appeal
the
fierce
eyes
the
hard
voice
softened
under
crayford
s
influence
richard
wardour
s
head
sank
on
his
breast
you
are
kinder
to
me
than
i
deserve
he
said
be
kinder
still
and
forget
what
i
have
been
talking
about
no
no
more
about
me
i
am
not
worth
it
we
ll
change
the
subject
and
never
go
back
to
it
again
let
s
do
something
work
crayford
that
s
the
true
elixir
of
our
life
work
that
stretches
the
muscles
and
sets
the
blood
work
that
tires
the
body
and
rests
the
mind
is
there
nothing
in
hand
that
i
can
do
nothing
to
cut
nothing
to
carry
the
door
opened
as
he
put
the
question
bateson
appointed
to
chop
frank
s
into
firing
appeared
punctually
with
his
ax
wardour
without
a
word
of
warning
snatched
the
ax
out
of
the
man
s
hand
what
was
this
wanted
for
he
asked
to
cut
up
aldersley
s
berth
there
into
firing
i
ll
do
it
for
you
i
ll
have
it
down
in
no
time
he
turned
to
crayford
you
needn
t
be
afraid
about
me
old
friend
i
am
going
to
do
the
right
thing
i
am
going
to
tire
my
body
and
rest
my
the
evil
spirit
in
him
was
plainly
subdued
for
the
time
at
least
crayford
took
his
hand
in
silence
and
then
followed
by
bateson
left
him
to
his
work
chapter
ax
in
hand
wardour
approached
frank
s
if
i
could
only
cut
the
thoughts
out
of
me
he
said
to
himself
as
i
am
going
to
cut
the
billets
out
of
this
wood
he
attacked
the
with
the
ax
like
a
man
who
well
knew
the
use
of
his
instrument
oh
me
he
thought
sadly
if
i
had
only
been
born
a
carpenter
instead
of
a
gentleman
a
good
ax
master
bateson
i
wonder
where
you
got
it
something
like
a
grip
my
man
on
this
handle
poor
crayford
his
words
stick
in
my
throat
a
fine
fellow
a
noble
fellow
no
use
thinking
no
use
regretting
what
is
said
is
said
work
work
work
plank
after
plank
fell
out
on
the
floor
he
laughed
over
the
easy
task
of
destruction
aha
young
aldersley
it
doesn
t
take
much
to
demolish
your
i
ll
have
it
down
i
would
have
the
whole
hut
down
if
they
would
only
give
me
the
chance
of
chopping
at
it
a
long
strip
of
wood
fell
to
his
ax
long
enough
to
require
cutting
in
two
he
turned
it
and
stooped
over
it
something
caught
his
eye
letters
carved
in
the
wood
he
looked
closer
the
letters
were
very
faintly
and
badly
cut
he
could
only
make
out
the
first
three
of
them
and
even
of
those
he
was
not
quite
certain
they
looked
like
c
l
a
if
they
looked
like
anything
he
threw
down
the
strip
of
wood
irritably
d
n
the
fellow
whoever
he
is
who
cut
this
why
should
he
carve
name
of
all
the
names
in
the
world
he
paused
considering
then
determined
to
go
on
again
with
his
labor
he
was
ashamed
of
his
own
outburst
he
looked
eagerly
for
the
ax
work
work
nothing
for
it
but
he
found
the
ax
and
went
on
again
he
cut
out
another
plank
he
stopped
and
looked
at
it
suspiciously
there
was
carving
again
on
this
plank
the
letters
and
appeared
on
it
he
put
down
the
ax
there
were
vague
misgivings
in
him
which
he
was
not
able
to
realize
the
state
of
his
own
mind
was
fast
becoming
a
puzzle
to
him
more
carving
he
said
to
himself
that
s
the
way
these
young
idlers
employ
their
long
hours
those
must
be
initials
frank
aldersley
who
carved
the
letters
on
the
other
plank
frank
aldersley
too
he
turned
the
piece
of
wood
in
his
hand
nearer
to
the
light
and
looked
lower
down
it
more
carving
again
lower
down
under
the
initials
were
two
more
letters
b
c
he
repeated
to
himself
his
sweet
heart
s
initials
i
suppose
of
course
at
his
age
his
sweetheart
s
he
paused
once
more
a
spasm
of
inner
pain
showed
the
shadow
of
its
mysterious
passage
outwardly
on
his
face
cipher
is
he
said
in
low
broken
tones
c
clara
he
waited
with
the
plank
in
his
hand
repeating
the
name
over
and
over
again
as
if
it
was
a
question
he
was
putting
to
himself
clara
burnham
clara
burnham
he
dropped
the
plank
and
turned
deadly
pale
in
a
moment
his
eyes
wandered
furtively
backward
and
forward
between
the
strip
of
wood
on
the
floor
and
the
berth
oh
god
what
has
come
to
me
now
he
said
to
himself
in
a
whisper
he
snatched
up
the
ax
with
a
strange
cry
something
between
rage
and
terror
he
tried
fiercely
desperately
tried
to
go
on
with
his
work
no
strong
as
he
was
he
could
not
use
the
ax
his
hands
were
helpless
they
trembled
incessantly
he
went
to
the
fire
he
held
his
hands
over
it
they
still
trembled
incessantly
they
infected
the
rest
of
him
he
shuddered
all
over
he
knew
fear
his
own
thoughts
terrified
him
crayford
he
cried
out
crayford
come
here
and
let
s
go
no
friendly
voice
answered
him
no
friendly
face
showed
itself
at
the
door
an
interval
passed
and
there
came
over
him
another
change
he
recovered
his
almost
as
suddenly
as
he
had
lost
it
a
smile
a
horrid
deforming
unnatural
smile
spread
slowly
stealthily
devilishly
over
his
face
he
left
the
fire
he
put
the
ax
away
softly
in
a
corner
he
sat
down
in
his
old
place
deliberately
to
a
frenzy
of
vindictive
joy
he
had
found
the
man
there
at
the
end
of
the
world
there
at
the
last
fight
of
the
arctic
voyagers
against
starvation
and
death
he
had
found
the
man
the
minutes
passed
he
became
conscious
on
a
sudden
of
a
freezing
stream
of
air
pouring
into
the
room
he
turned
and
saw
crayford
opening
the
door
of
the
hut
a
man
was
behind
him
wardour
rose
eagerly
and
looked
over
crayford
s
shoulder
was
it
could
it
be
the
man
who
had
carved
the
letters
on
the
plank
yes
frank
aldersley

still
at
work
crayford
exclaimed
looking
at
the
give
yourself
a
little
rest
richard
the
exploring
party
is
ready
to
start
if
you
wish
to
take
leave
of
your
brother
officers
before
they
go
you
have
no
time
to
he
checked
himself
there
looking
wardour
full
in
the
face
good
heavens
he
cried
how
pale
you
are
has
anything
happened
frank
searching
in
his
locker
for
articles
of
clothing
which
he
might
require
on
the
journey
looked
round
he
was
startled
as
crayford
had
been
startled
by
the
sudden
change
in
wardour
since
they
had
last
seen
him
are
you
ill
he
asked
i
hear
you
have
been
doing
bateson
s
work
for
him
have
you
hurt
yourself
wardour
suddenly
moved
his
head
so
as
to
hide
his
face
from
both
crayford
and
frank
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wound
it
clumsily
round
his
left
hand
yes
he
said
i
hurt
myself
with
the
ax
it
s
nothing
never
mind
pain
always
has
a
curious
effect
on
me
i
tell
you
it
s
nothing
don
t
notice
it
he
turned
his
face
toward
them
again
as
suddenly
as
he
had
turned
it
away
he
advanced
a
few
steps
and
addressed
himself
with
an
uneasy
familiarity
to
frank
i
didn
t
answer
you
civilly
when
you
spoke
to
me
some
little
time
since
i
mean
when
i
first
came
in
here
along
with
the
rest
of
them
i
apologize
shake
hands
how
are
you
ready
for
the
march
frank
met
the
oddly
abrupt
advance
which
had
been
made
to
him
with
perfect
good
humor
i
am
glad
to
be
friends
with
you
wardour
i
wish
i
was
as
well
seasoned
to
fatigue
as
you
wardour
burst
into
a
hard
joyless
unnatural
laugh
not
strong
eh
you
don
t
look
it
the
dice
had
better
have
sent
me
away
and
kept
you
here
i
never
felt
in
better
condition
in
my
he
paused
and
added
with
his
eye
on
frank
and
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
words
we
men
of
kent
are
made
of
tough
frank
advanced
a
step
on
his
side
with
a
new
interest
in
richard
wardour
you
come
from
kent
he
said
yes
from
east
he
waited
a
little
once
more
and
looked
hard
at
frank
do
you
know
that
part
of
the
country
he
asked
i
ought
to
know
something
about
east
kent
frank
answered
some
dear
friends
of
mine
once
lived
friends
of
yours
wardour
repeated
one
of
the
county
families
i
suppose
as
he
put
the
question
he
abruptly
looked
over
his
shoulder
he
was
standing
between
crayford
and
frank
crayford
taking
no
part
in
the
conversation
had
been
watching
him
and
listening
to
him
more
and
more
attentively
as
that
conversation
went
on
within
the
last
moment
or
two
wardour
had
become
instinctively
conscious
of
this
he
resented
crayford
s
conduct
with
needless
irritability
why
are
you
staring
at
me
he
asked
why
are
you
looking
unlike
yourself
crayford
answered
quietly
wardour
made
no
reply
he
renewed
the
conversation
with
frank
one
of
the
county
families
he
resumed
the
winterbys
of
yew
grange
i
dare
say
no
said
frank
but
friends
of
the
witherbys
very
likely
the
desperately
as
he
struggled
to
maintain
it
wardour
s
failed
him
he
started
violently
the
handkerchief
fell
off
his
hand
still
looking
at
him
attentively
crayford
picked
it
up
there
is
your
handkerchief
richard
he
said
strange
what
is
strange
you
told
us
you
had
hurt
yourself
with
the
ax
well
there
is
no
blood
on
your
wardour
snatched
the
handkerchief
out
of
crayford
s
hand
and
turning
away
approached
the
outer
door
of
the
hut
no
blood
on
the
handkerchief
he
said
to
himself
there
may
be
a
stain
or
two
when
crayford
sees
it
he
stopped
within
a
few
paces
of
the
door
and
spoke
to
crayford
you
recommended
me
to
take
leave
of
my
brother
officers
before
it
was
too
late
he
said
i
am
going
to
follow
your
the
door
was
opened
from
the
outer
side
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
lock
one
of
the
quartermasters
of
the
entered
the
hut
is
captain
helding
here
sir
he
asked
addressing
himself
to
wardour
wardour
pointed
to
crayford
the
lieutenant
will
tell
you
he
said
crayford
advanced
and
questioned
the
quartermaster
what
do
you
want
with
captain
helding
he
asked
i
have
a
report
to
make
sir
there
has
been
an
accident
on
the
to
one
of
your
men
no
sir
to
one
of
our
wardour
on
the
point
of
going
out
paused
when
the
quartermaster
made
that
reply
for
a
moment
he
considered
with
himself
then
he
walked
slowly
back
to
the
part
of
the
room
in
which
frank
was
standing
crayford
directing
the
quartermaster
pointed
to
the
arched
door
way
in
the
side
of
the
hut
i
am
sorry
to
hear
of
the
accident
he
said
you
will
find
captain
helding
in
that
for
the
second
time
with
singular
persistency
wardour
renewed
the
conversation
with
frank
so
you
knew
the
burnhams
he
said
what
became
of
clara
when
her
father
died
frank
s
face
flushed
angrily
on
the
instant
clara
he
repeated
what
authorizes
you
to
speak
of
miss
burnham
in
that
familiar
manner
wardour
seized
the
opportunity
of
quarreling
with
him
what
right
have
you
to
ask
he
retorted
coarsely
frank
s
blood
was
up
he
forgot
his
promise
to
clara
to
keep
their
engagement
secret
he
forgot
everything
but
the
unbridled
insolence
of
wardour
s
language
and
manner
a
right
which
i
insist
on
your
respecting
he
answered
the
right
of
being
engaged
to
marry
crayford
s
steady
eyes
were
still
on
the
watch
and
wardour
felt
them
on
him
a
little
more
and
crayford
might
openly
interfere
even
wardour
recognized
for
once
the
necessity
of
controlling
his
temper
cost
him
what
it
might
he
made
his
apologies
with
overstrained
politeness
to
frank
impossible
to
dispute
such
a
right
as
yours
he
said
perhaps
you
will
excuse
me
when
you
know
that
i
am
one
of
miss
burnham
s
old
friends
my
father
and
her
father
were
neighbors
we
have
always
met
like
brother
and
sister
frank
generously
stopped
the
apology
there
say
no
more
he
interposed
i
was
in
the
wrong
i
lost
my
temper
pray
forgive
wardour
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
reluctant
interest
while
he
was
speaking
wardour
asked
an
extraordinary
question
when
he
had
done
is
she
very
fond
of
you
frank
burst
out
laughing
my
dear
fellow
he
said
come
to
our
wedding
and
judge
for
come
to
your
wedding
as
he
repeated
the
words
wardour
stole
one
glance
at
frank
which
frank
employed
in
buckling
his
knapsack
failed
to
see
crayford
noticed
it
and
crayford
s
blood
ran
cold
comparing
the
words
which
wardour
had
spoken
to
him
while
they
were
alone
together
with
the
words
that
had
just
passed
in
his
presence
he
could
draw
but
one
conclusion
the
woman
whom
wardour
had
loved
and
lost
was
clara
burnham
the
man
who
had
robbed
him
of
her
was
frank
aldersley
and
wardour
had
discovered
it
in
the
interval
since
they
had
last
met
thank
god
thought
crayford
the
dice
have
parted
them
frank
goes
with
the
expedition
and
wardour
stays
behind
with
the
reflection
had
barely
occurred
to
him
frank
s
thoughtless
invitation
to
wardour
had
just
passed
his
lips
when
the
canvas
screen
over
the
doorway
was
drawn
aside
captain
helding
and
the
officers
who
were
to
leave
with
the
exploring
party
returned
to
the
main
room
on
their
way
out
seeing
crayford
captain
helding
stopped
to
speak
to
him
i
have
a
casualty
to
report
said
the
captain
which
diminishes
our
numbers
by
one
my
second
lieutenant
who
was
to
have
joined
the
exploring
party
has
had
a
fall
on
the
ice
judging
by
what
the
quartermaster
tells
me
i
am
afraid
the
poor
fellow
has
broken
his
i
will
supply
his
place
cried
a
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
hut
everybody
looked
round
the
man
who
had
spoken
was
richard
wardour
crayford
instantly
interfered
so
vehemently
as
to
astonish
all
who
knew
him
no
he
said
not
you
richard
not
you
why
not
wardour
asked
sternly
why
not
indeed
added
captain
helding
wardour
is
the
very
man
to
be
useful
on
a
long
march
he
is
in
perfect
health
and
he
is
the
best
shot
among
us
i
was
on
the
point
of
proposing
him
crayford
failed
to
show
his
customary
respect
for
his
superior
officer
he
openly
disputed
the
captain
s
conclusion
wardour
has
no
right
to
volunteer
he
rejoined
it
has
been
settled
captain
helding
that
chance
shall
decide
who
is
to
go
and
who
is
to
and
chance
decided
it
cried
wardour
do
you
think
we
are
going
to
cast
the
dice
again
and
give
an
officer
of
the
a
chance
of
replacing
an
officer
of
the
there
is
a
vacancy
in
our
party
not
in
yours
and
we
claim
the
right
of
filling
it
as
we
please
i
volunteer
and
my
captain
backs
me
whose
authority
is
to
keep
me
here
after
that
gently
wardour
said
captain
helding
a
man
who
is
in
the
right
can
afford
to
speak
with
he
turned
to
crayford
you
must
admit
yourself
he
continued
that
wardour
is
right
this
time
the
missing
man
belongs
to
my
command
and
in
common
justice
one
of
my
officers
ought
to
supply
his
it
was
impossible
to
dispute
the
matter
further
the
dullest
man
present
could
see
that
the
captain
s
reply
was
unanswerable
in
sheer
despair
crayford
took
frank
s
arm
and
led
him
aside
a
few
steps
the
last
chance
left
of
parting
the
two
men
was
the
chance
of
appealing
to
frank
my
dear
boy
he
began
i
want
to
say
one
friendly
word
to
you
on
the
subject
of
your
health
i
have
already
if
you
remember
expressed
my
doubts
whether
you
are
strong
enough
to
make
one
of
an
exploring
party
i
feel
those
doubts
more
strongly
than
ever
at
this
moment
will
you
take
the
advice
of
a
friend
who
wishes
you
well
wardour
had
followed
crayford
wardour
roughly
interposed
before
frank
could
reply
let
him
alone
crayford
paid
no
heed
to
the
interruption
he
was
too
earnestly
bent
on
withdrawing
frank
from
the
expedition
to
notice
anything
that
was
said
or
done
by
the
persons
about
him
don
t
pray
don
t
risk
hardships
which
you
are
unfit
to
bear
he
went
on
entreatingly
your
place
can
be
easily
filled
change
your
mind
frank
stay
here
with
again
wardour
interfered
again
he
called
out
leave
him
alone
more
roughly
than
ever
still
deaf
and
blind
to
every
consideration
but
one
crayford
pressed
his
entreaties
on
frank
you
owned
yourself
just
now
that
you
were
not
well
seasoned
to
fatigue
he
persisted
you
feel
you
feel
how
weak
that
last
illness
has
left
you
you
know
i
am
sure
you
know
how
unfit
you
are
to
brave
exposure
to
cold
and
long
marches
over
the
irritated
beyond
endurance
by
crayford
s
obstinacy
seeing
or
thinking
he
saw
signs
of
yielding
in
frank
s
face
wardour
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
seize
crayford
by
the
arm
and
attempt
to
drag
him
away
from
frank
crayford
turned
and
looked
at
him
richard
he
said
very
quietly
you
are
not
yourself
i
pity
you
drop
your
wardour
relaxed
his
hold
with
something
of
the
sullen
submission
of
a
wild
animal
to
its
keeper
the
momentary
silence
which
followed
gave
frank
an
opportunity
of
speaking
at
last
i
am
gratefully
sensible
crayford
he
began
of
the
interest
which
you
take
in
me
and
you
will
follow
my
advice
crayford
interposed
eagerly
my
mind
is
made
up
old
friend
frank
answered
firmly
and
sadly
forgive
me
for
disappointing
you
i
am
appointed
to
the
expedition
with
the
expedition
i
he
moved
nearer
to
wardour
in
his
innocence
of
all
suspicion
he
clapped
wardour
heartily
on
the
shoulder
when
i
feel
the
fatigue
said
poor
simple
frank
you
will
help
me
comrade
won
t
you
come
along
wardour
snatched
his
gun
out
of
the
hands
of
the
sailor
who
was
carrying
it
for
him
his
dark
face
became
suddenly
irradiated
with
a
terrible
joy
come
he
cried
over
the
snow
and
over
the
ice
come
where
no
human
footsteps
have
ever
trodden
and
where
no
human
trace
is
ever
blindly
instinctively
crayford
made
an
effort
to
part
them
his
brother
officers
standing
near
pulled
him
back
they
looked
at
each
other
anxiously
the
merciless
cold
striking
its
victims
in
various
ways
had
struck
in
some
instances
at
their
reason
first
everybody
loved
crayford
was
he
too
going
on
the
dark
way
that
others
had
taken
before
him
they
forced
him
to
seat
himself
on
one
of
the
lockers
steady
old
fellow
they
said
kindly
steady
crayford
yielded
writhing
inwardly
under
the
sense
of
his
own
helplessness
what
in
god
s
name
could
he
do
could
he
denounce
wardour
to
captain
helding
on
bare
suspicion
without
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
proof
to
justify
what
he
said
the
captain
would
decline
to
insult
one
of
his
officers
by
even
mentioning
the
monstrous
accusation
to
him
the
captain
would
conclude
as
others
had
already
concluded
that
crayford
s
mind
was
giving
way
under
stress
of
cold
and
privation
no
hope
literally
no
hope
now
but
in
the
numbers
of
the
expedition
officers
and
men
they
all
liked
frank
as
long
as
they
could
stir
hand
or
foot
they
would
help
him
on
the
way
they
would
see
that
no
harm
came
to
him
the
word
of
command
was
given
the
door
was
thrown
open
the
hut
emptied
rapidly
over
the
merciless
white
snow
under
the
merciless
black
sky
the
exploring
party
began
to
move
the
sick
and
helpless
men
whose
last
hope
of
rescue
centered
in
their
departing
messmates
cheered
faintly
some
few
whose
days
were
numbered
sobbed
and
cried
like
women
frank
s
voice
faltered
as
he
turned
back
at
the
door
to
say
his
last
words
to
the
friend
who
had
been
a
father
to
him
god
bless
you
crayford
crayford
broke
away
from
the
officers
near
him
and
hurrying
forward
seized
frank
by
both
hands
crayford
held
him
as
if
he
would
never
let
him
go
god
preserve
you
frank
i
would
give
all
i
have
in
the
world
to
be
with
you
frank
waved
his
hand
dashed
away
the
tears
that
were
gathering
in
his
eyes
and
hurried
out
crayford
called
after
him
the
last
the
only
warning
that
he
could
give
while
you
can
stand
keep
with
the
main
body
frank
wardour
waiting
till
the
last
wardour
following
frank
through
the
stopped
stepped
back
and
answered
crayford
at
the
door
while
he
can
stand
he
keeps
with
third
scene
the
iceberg
chapter
alone
alone
on
the
frozen
deep
the
arctic
sun
is
rising
dimly
in
the
dreary
sky
the
beams
of
the
cold
northern
moon
mingling
strangely
with
the
dawning
light
clothe
the
snowy
plains
in
hues
of
livid
gray
an
on
the
far
horizon
is
moving
slowly
southward
in
the
spectral
light
nearer
a
stream
of
open
water
rolls
its
slow
black
waves
past
the
edges
of
the
ice
nearer
still
following
the
drift
an
iceberg
rears
its
crags
and
pinnacles
to
the
sky
here
glittering
in
the
moonbeams
there
looming
dim
and
in
the
ashy
light
midway
on
the
long
sweep
of
the
lower
slope
of
the
iceberg
what
objects
rise
and
break
the
desolate
monotony
of
the
scene
in
this
awful
solitude
can
signs
appear
which
tell
of
human
life
yes
the
black
outline
of
a
boat
just
shows
itself
hauled
up
on
the
berg
in
an
behind
the
boat
the
last
red
embers
of
a
dying
fire
flicker
from
time
to
time
over
the
figures
of
two
men
one
is
seated
resting
his
back
against
the
side
of
the
cavern
the
other
lies
prostrate
with
his
head
on
his
comrade
s
knee
the
first
of
these
men
is
awake
and

fourth

the
garden
chapter
the
spring
has
come
the
air
of
the
april
night
just
lifts
the
leaves
of
the
sleeping
flowers
the
moon
is
queen
in
the
cloudless
and
starless
sky
the
stillness
of
the
midnight
hour
is
abroad
over
land
and
over
sea
in
a
villa
on
the
westward
shore
of
the
isle
of
wight
the
glass
doors
which
lead
from
the
to
the
garden
are
yet
open
the
shaded
lamp
yet
burns
on
the
table
a
lady
sits
by
the
lamp
reading
from
time
to
time
she
looks
out
into
the
garden
and
sees
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
pacing
slowly
to
and
fro
in
the
soft
brightness
of
the
moonlight
on
the
lawn
sorrow
and
suspense
have
set
their
mark
on
the
lady
not
rivals
only
but
friends
who
formerly
admired
her
agree
now
that
she
looks
worn
and
aged
the
more
merciful
judgment
of
others
remarks
with
equal
truth
that
her
eyes
her
hair
her
simple
grace
and
grandeur
of
movement
have
lost
but
little
of
their
olden
charms
the
truth
lies
as
usual
between
the
two
extremes
in
spite
of
sorrow
and
suffering
crayford
is
the
beautiful
crayford
still
the
delicious
silence
of
the
hour
is
softly
disturbed
by
the
voice
of
the
younger
lady
in
the
garden
go
to
the
piano
lucy
it
is
a
night
for
music
play
something
that
is
worthy
of
the
crayford
looks
round
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
my
dear
clara
it
is
past
twelve
remember
what
the
doctor
told
you
you
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
an
hour
half
an
hour
lucy
give
me
half
an
hour
more
look
at
the
moonlight
on
the
sea
is
it
possible
to
go
to
bed
on
such
a
night
as
this
play
something
lucy
something
spiritual
and
earnestly
pleading
with
her
friend
clara
advances
toward
the
window
she
too
has
suffered
under
the
wasting
influences
of
suspense
her
face
has
lost
its
youthful
freshness
no
delicate
flush
of
color
rises
on
it
when
she
speaks
the
soft
gray
eyes
which
won
frank
s
heart
in
the
time
are
sadly
altered
now
in
repose
they
have
a
dimmed
and
wearied
look
in
action
they
are
wild
and
restless
like
eyes
suddenly
wakened
from
startling
dreams
robed
in
white
her
soft
brown
hair
hanging
loosely
over
her
shoulders
there
is
something
weird
and
in
the
girl
as
she
moves
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
window
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
pleading
for
music
that
shall
be
worthy
of
the
mystery
and
the
beauty
of
the
night
will
you
come
in
here
if
i
play
to
you
crayford
asks
it
is
a
risk
my
love
to
be
out
so
long
in
the
night
no
no
i
like
it
play
while
i
am
out
here
looking
at
the
sea
it
quiets
me
it
comforts
me
it
does
me
she
glides
back
over
the
lawn
crayford
rises
and
puts
down
the
volume
that
she
has
been
reading
it
is
a
record
of
explorations
in
the
arctic
seas
the
time
has
gone
by
when
the
two
lonely
women
could
take
an
interest
in
subjects
not
connected
with
their
own
anxieties
now
when
hope
is
fast
failing
them
now
when
their
last
news
of
the
and
the
is
news
that
is
more
than
two
years
old
they
can
read
of
nothing
they
can
think
of
nothing
but
dangers
and
discoveries
losses
and
rescues
in
the
terrible
polar
seas
unwillingly
crayford
puts
her
book
aside
and
opens
the
piano
mozart
s
air
in
a
with
variations
lies
open
on
the
instrument
one
after
another
she
plays
the
lovely
melodies
so
simply
so
purely
beautiful
of
that
unpretending
and
unrivaled
work
at
the
close
of
the
ninth
variation
clara
s
favorite
she
pauses
and
turns
toward
the
garden
shall
i
stop
there
she
asks
there
is
no
answer
has
clara
wandered
away
out
of
hearing
of
the
music
that
she
loves
the
music
that
harmonizes
so
subtly
with
the
tender
beauty
of
the
night
crayford
rises
and
advances
to
the
window
no
there
is
the
white
figure
standing
alone
on
the
slope
of
the
lawn
the
head
turned
away
from
the
house
the
face
looking
out
over
the
calm
sea
whose
gently
rippling
waters
end
in
the
dim
line
on
the
horizon
which
is
the
line
of
the
hampshire
coast
crayford
advances
as
far
as
the
path
before
the
window
and
calls
to
her
clara
again
there
is
no
answer
the
white
figure
still
stands
immovably
in
its
place
with
signs
of
distress
in
her
face
but
with
no
appearance
of
alarm
crayford
returns
to
the
room
her
own
sad
experience
tells
her
what
has
happened
she
summons
the
servants
and
directs
them
to
wait
in
the
until
she
calls
to
them
this
done
she
returns
to
the
garden
and
approaches
the
mysterious
figure
on
the
lawn
dead
to
the
outer
world
as
if
she
lay
already
in
her
grave
insensible
to
touch
insensible
to
sound
motionless
as
stone
cold
as
stone
clara
stands
on
the
moonlit
lawn
facing
the
seaward
view
crayford
waits
at
her
side
patiently
watching
for
the
change
which
she
knows
is
to
come
catalepsy
as
some
call
it
hysteria
as
others
say
this
alone
is
certain
the
same
interval
always
passes
the
same
change
always
appears
it
comes
now
not
a
change
in
her
eyes
they
still
remain
wide
open
fixed
and
glassy
the
first
movement
is
a
movement
of
her
hands
they
rise
slowly
from
her
side
and
waver
in
the
air
like
the
hands
of
a
person
groping
in
the
dark
another
interval
and
the
movement
spreads
to
her
lips
they
part
and
tremble
a
few
minutes
more
and
words
begin
to
drop
one
by
one
from
those
parted
lips
words
spoken
in
a
lost
vacant
tone
as
if
she
is
talking
in
her
sleep
crayford
looks
back
at
the
house
sad
experience
makes
her
suspicious
of
the
servants
curiosity
sad
experience
has
long
since
warned
her
that
the
servants
are
not
to
be
trusted
within
hearing
of
the
wild
words
which
clara
speaks
in
the
trance
has
any
one
of
them
ventured
into
the
garden
no
they
are
out
of
hearing
at
the
window
waiting
for
the
signal
which
tells
them
that
their
help
is
needed
turning
toward
clara
once
more
crayford
hears
the
vacantly
uttered
words
falling
faster
and
faster
from
her
lips
frank
frank
frank
don
t
drop
behind
don
t
trust
richard
wardour
while
you
can
stand
keep
with
the
other
men
frank
the
farewell
warning
of
crayford
in
the
solitudes
of
the
frozen
deep
repeated
by
clara
in
the
garden
of
her
english
home
a
moment
of
silence
follows
and
in
that
moment
the
vision
has
changed
she
sees
him
on
the
iceberg
now
at
the
mercy
of
the
bitterest
enemy
he
has
on
earth
she
sees
him
drifting
over
the
black
water
through
the
ashy
light
wake
frank
wake
and
defend
yourself
richard
wardour
knows
that
i
love
you
richard
wardour
s
vengeance
will
take
your
life
wake
frank
wake
you
are
drifting
to
your
death
a
low
groan
of
horror
bursts
from
her
sinister
and
terrible
to
hear
drifting
drifting
she
whispers
to
herself
drifting
to
his
death
her
glassy
eyes
suddenly
soften
then
close
a
long
shudder
runs
through
her
a
faint
flush
shows
itself
on
the
deadly
pallor
of
her
face
and
fades
again
her
limbs
fail
her
she
sinks
into
crayford
s
arms
the
servants
answering
the
call
for
help
carry
her
into
the
house
they
lay
her
insensible
on
her
bed
after
half
an
hour
or
more
her
eyes
open
again
this
time
with
the
light
of
life
in
them
open
and
rest
languidly
on
the
friend
sitting
by
the
bedside
i
have
had
a
dreadful
dream
she
murmurs
faintly
am
i
ill
lucy
i
feel
so
even
as
she
says
the
words
sleep
gentle
natural
sleep
takes
her
suddenly
as
it
takes
young
children
weary
with
their
play
though
it
is
all
over
now
though
no
further
watching
is
required
crayford
still
keeps
her
place
by
the
bedside
too
anxious
and
too
wakeful
to
retire
to
her
own
room
on
other
occasions
she
is
accustomed
to
dismiss
from
her
mind
the
words
which
drop
from
clara
in
the
trance
this
time
the
effort
to
dismiss
them
is
beyond
her
power
the
words
haunt
her
vainly
she
recalls
to
memory
all
that
the
doctors
have
said
to
her
in
speaking
of
clara
in
the
state
of
trance
what
she
vaguely
dreads
for
the
lost
man
whom
she
loves
is
mingled
in
her
mind
with
what
she
is
constantly
reading
of
trials
dangers
and
escapes
in
the
arctic
seas
the
most
startling
things
that
she
may
say
or
do
are
all
attributable
to
this
cause
and
may
all
be
explained
in
this
so
the
doctors
have
spoken
and
thus
far
crayford
has
shared
their
view
it
is
only
that
the
girl
s
words
ring
in
her
ear
with
a
strange
prophetic
sound
in
them
it
is
only
that
she
asks
herself
is
clara
present
in
the
spirit
with
our
loved
and
lost
ones
in
the
lonely
north
can
mortal
vision
see
the
dead
and
living
in
the
solitudes
of
the
frozen
deep
chapter
the
night
had
passed
far
and
near
the
garden
view
looked
its
gayest
and
brightest
in
the
light
of
the
noonday
sun
the
cheering
sounds
which
tell
of
life
and
action
were
audible
all
round
the
villa
from
the
garden
of
the
nearest
house
rose
the
voices
of
children
at
play
along
the
road
at
the
back
sounded
the
roll
of
wheels
as
carts
and
carriages
passed
at
intervals
out
on
the
blue
sea
the
distant
splash
of
the
paddles
the
distant
thump
of
the
engines
told
from
time
to
time
of
the
passage
of
steamers
entering
or
leaving
the
strait
between
the
island
and
the
mainland
in
the
trees
the
birds
sang
gayly
among
the
rustling
leaves
in
the
house
the
were
laughing
over
some
jest
or
story
that
cheered
them
at
their
work
it
was
a
lively
and
pleasant
time
a
bright
enjoyable
day
the
two
ladies
were
out
together
resting
on
a
garden
seat
after
a
walk
round
the
grounds
they
exchanged
a
few
trivial
words
relating
to
the
beauty
of
the
day
and
then
said
no
more
possessing
the
same
consciousness
of
what
she
had
seen
in
the
trance
which
persons
in
general
possess
of
what
they
have
seen
in
a
dream
believing
in
the
vision
as
a
supernatural
revelation
clara
s
worst
forebodings
were
now
to
her
mind
realized
as
truths
her
last
faint
hope
of
ever
seeing
frank
again
was
now
at
an
end
intimate
experience
of
her
told
crayford
what
was
passing
in
clara
s
mind
and
warned
her
that
the
attempt
to
reason
and
remonstrate
would
be
little
better
than
a
voluntary
waste
of
words
and
time
the
disposition
which
she
had
herself
felt
on
the
previous
night
to
attach
a
superstitious
importance
to
the
words
that
clara
had
spoken
in
the
trance
had
vanished
with
the
return
of
the
morning
rest
and
reflection
had
quieted
her
mind
and
had
restored
the
composing
influence
of
her
sober
sense
sympathizing
with
clara
in
all
besides
she
had
no
sympathy
as
they
sat
together
in
the
pleasant
sunshine
with
clara
s
gloomy
despair
of
the
future
she
who
could
still
hope
had
nothing
to
say
to
the
sad
companion
who
had
done
with
hope
so
the
quiet
minutes
succeeded
each
other
and
the
two
friends
sat
side
by
side
in
silence
an
hour
passed
and
the
of
the
villa
rang
they
both
started
they
both
knew
the
ring
it
was
the
hour
when
the
postman
brought
their
newspapers
from
london
in
past
days
what
hundreds
on
hundreds
of
times
they
had
torn
off
the
cover
which
inclosed
the
newspaper
and
looked
at
the
same
column
with
the
same
weary
mingling
of
hope
and
despair
there
as
it
was
yesterday
as
it
would
be
if
they
lived
there
was
the
servant
with
lucy
s
newspaper
and
clara
s
newspaper
in
his
hand
would
both
of
them
do
again
what
both
had
done
so
often
in
the
days
that
were
gone
no
crayford
removed
the
cover
from
her
newspaper
as
usual
clara
laid
newspaper
aside
unopened
on
the
garden
seat
in
silence
crayford
looked
where
she
always
looked
at
the
column
devoted
to
the
latest
intelligence
from
foreign
parts
the
instant
her
eye
fell
on
the
page
she
started
with
a
loud
cry
of
joy
the
newspaper
fell
from
her
trembling
hand
she
caught
clara
in
her
arms
oh
my
darling
my
darling
news
of
them
at
without
answering
without
the
slightest
change
in
look
or
manner
clara
took
the
newspaper
from
the
ground
and
read
the
top
line
in
the
column
printed
in
capital
letters
the
arctic
expedition
she
waited
and
looked
at
crayford
can
you
bear
to
hear
it
lucy
she
asked
if
i
read
it
aloud
crayford
was
too
agitated
to
answer
in
words
she
signed
impatiently
to
clara
to
go
on
clara
read
the
news
which
followed
the
heading
in
capital
letters
thus
it
ran
the
following
intelligence
from
johns
newfoundland
has
reached
us
for
publication
the
is
reported
to
have
met
with
the
surviving
officers
and
men
of
the
expedition
in
davis
strait
many
are
stated
to
be
dead
and
some
are
supposed
to
be
missing
the
list
of
the
saved
as
collected
by
the
people
of
the
whaler
is
not
vouched
for
as
being
absolutely
correct
the
circumstances
having
been
adverse
to
investigation
the
vessel
was
pressed
for
time
and
the
members
of
the
expedition
all
more
or
less
suffering
from
exhaustion
were
not
in
a
position
to
give
the
necessary
assistance
to
inquiry
further
particulars
may
be
looked
for
by
the
next
the
list
of
the
survivors
followed
beginning
with
the
officers
in
the
order
of
their
rank
they
both
read
the
list
together
the
first
name
was
captain
helding
the
second
was
lieutenant
crayford
there
the
wife
s
joy
overpowered
her
after
a
pause
she
put
her
arm
around
clara
s
waist
and
spoke
to
her
oh
my
love
she
murmured
are
you
as
happy
as
i
am
is
frank
s
name
there
too
the
tears
are
in
my
eyes
read
for
me
i
can
t
read
for
the
answer
came
in
still
sad
tones
i
have
read
as
far
as
your
husband
s
name
i
have
no
need
to
read
crayford
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
steadied
herself
and
looked
at
the
newspaper
on
the
list
of
the
survivors
the
search
was
vain
frank
s
name
was
not
among
them
on
a
second
list
headed
dead
or
missing
the
first
two
names
that
appeared
were
francis
aldersley
richard
wardour
in
speechless
distress
and
dismay
crayford
looked
at
clara
had
she
force
enough
in
her
feeble
health
to
sustain
the
shock
that
had
fallen
on
her
yes
she
bore
it
with
a
strange
unnatural
resignation
she
looked
she
spoke
with
the
sad
of
despair
i
was
prepared
for
it
she
said
i
saw
them
in
the
spirit
last
night
richard
wardour
has
discovered
the
truth
and
frank
has
paid
the
penalty
with
his
life
and
i
i
alone
am
to
she
shuddered
and
put
her
hand
on
her
heart
we
shall
not
be
long
parted
lucy
i
shall
go
to
him
he
will
not
return
to
those
words
were
spoken
with
a
calm
certainty
of
conviction
that
was
terrible
to
hear
i
have
no
more
to
say
she
added
after
a
moment
and
rose
to
return
to
the
house
crayford
caught
her
by
the
hand
and
forced
her
to
take
her
seat
again
don
t
look
at
me
don
t
speak
to
me
in
that
horrible
manner
she
exclaimed
clara
it
is
unworthy
of
a
reasonable
being
it
is
doubting
the
mercy
of
god
to
say
what
you
have
just
said
look
at
the
newspaper
again
see
they
tell
you
plainly
that
their
information
is
not
to
be
depended
on
they
warn
you
to
wait
for
further
particulars
the
very
words
at
the
top
of
the
list
show
how
little
they
knew
of
the
truth
dead
missing
on
their
own
showing
it
is
quite
as
likely
that
frank
is
missing
as
that
frank
is
dead
for
all
you
know
the
next
mail
may
bring
a
letter
from
him
are
you
listening
to
me
can
you
deny
what
i
say
yes
no
is
that
the
way
to
answer
me
when
i
am
so
distressed
and
so
anxious
about
you
i
am
sorry
i
spoke
as
i
did
lucy
we
look
at
some
subjects
in
very
different
ways
i
don
t
dispute
dear
that
yours
is
the
reasonable
you
don
t
dispute
retorted
crayford
warmly
no
you
do
what
is
worse
you
believe
in
your
own
opinion
you
persist
in
your
own
conclusion
with
the
newspaper
before
you
do
you
or
do
you
not
believe
the
newspaper
i
believe
in
what
i
saw
last
in
what
you
saw
last
night
you
an
educated
woman
a
clever
woman
believing
in
a
vision
of
your
own
fancy
a
mere
dream
i
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
to
acknowledge
it
call
it
a
dream
if
you
like
lucy
i
have
had
other
dreams
at
other
times
and
i
have
known
them
to
be
yes
said
crayford
for
once
in
a
way
they
may
have
been
fulfilled
by
chance
and
you
notice
it
and
remember
it
and
pin
your
faith
on
it
come
clara
be
honest
what
about
the
occasions
when
the
chance
has
been
against
you
and
your
dreams
have
not
been
fulfilled
you
superstitious
people
are
all
alike
you
conveniently
forget
when
your
dreams
and
your
presentiments
prove
false
for
my
sake
dear
if
not
for
your
own
she
continued
in
gentler
and
tenderer
tones
try
to
be
more
reasonable
and
more
hopeful
don
t
lose
your
trust
in
the
future
and
your
trust
in
god
god
who
has
saved
my
husband
can
save
frank
while
there
is
doubt
there
is
hope
don
t
embitter
my
happiness
clara
try
to
think
as
i
think
if
it
is
only
to
show
that
you
love
she
put
her
arm
round
the
girl
s
neck
and
kissed
her
clara
returned
the
kiss
clara
answered
sadly
and
submissively
i
do
love
you
lucy
i
having
answered
in
those
terms
she
sighed
to
herself
and
said
no
more
it
would
have
been
plain
only
too
plain
to
far
less
observant
eyes
than
crayford
s
that
no
salutary
impression
had
been
produced
on
her
she
had
ceased
to
defend
her
own
way
of
thinking
she
spoke
of
it
no
more
but
there
was
the
terrible
conviction
of
frank
s
death
at
wardour
s
hands
rooted
as
firmly
as
ever
in
her
mind
discouraged
and
distressed
crayford
left
her
and
walked
back
toward
the
house
chapter
at
the
window
of
the
villa
there
appeared
a
polite
little
man
with
bright
intelligent
eyes
and
cheerful
sociable
manners
neatly
dressed
in
professional
black
he
stood
a
prosperous
country
doctor
successful
and
popular
in
a
wide
circle
of
patients
and
friends
as
crayford
approached
him
he
stepped
out
briskly
to
meet
her
on
the
lawn
with
both
hands
extended
in
courteous
and
cordial
greeting
my
dear
madam
accept
my
heartfelt
congratulations
cried
the
doctor
i
have
seen
the
good
news
in
the
paper
and
i
could
hardly
feel
more
rejoiced
than
i
do
now
if
i
had
the
honor
of
knowing
lieutenant
crayford
personally
we
mean
to
celebrate
the
occasion
at
home
i
said
to
my
wife
before
i
came
out
a
bottle
of
the
old
madeira
at
dinner
mind
to
drink
the
lieutenant
s
health
god
bless
him
and
how
is
our
interesting
patient
the
news
is
not
altogether
what
we
could
wish
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
i
felt
a
little
anxious
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
the
effect
of
it
and
i
have
paid
my
visit
before
my
usual
time
not
that
i
take
a
gloomy
view
of
the
news
myself
no
there
is
clearly
a
doubt
about
the
correctness
of
the
information
so
far
as
aldersley
is
concerned
and
that
is
a
point
a
great
point
in
aldersley
s
favor
i
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
the
lawyers
say
does
miss
burnham
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
too
i
hardly
dare
hope
it
i
miss
burnham
has
grieved
and
alarmed
me
crayford
answered
i
was
just
thinking
of
sending
for
you
when
we
met
with
those
introductory
words
she
told
the
doctor
exactly
what
had
happened
repeating
not
only
the
conversation
of
that
morning
between
clara
and
herself
but
also
the
words
which
had
fallen
from
clara
in
the
trance
of
the
past
night
the
doctor
listened
attentively
little
by
little
its
easy
smiling
composure
vanished
from
his
face
as
crayford
went
on
and
left
him
completely
transformed
into
a
grave
and
thoughtful
man
let
us
go
and
look
at
her
he
said
he
seated
himself
by
clara
s
side
and
carefully
studied
her
face
with
his
hand
on
her
pulse
there
was
no
sympathy
here
between
the
dreamy
mystical
temperament
of
the
patient
and
the
downright
practical
character
of
the
doctor
clara
secretly
disliked
her
medical
attendant
she
submitted
impatiently
to
the
close
investigation
of
which
he
made
her
the
object
he
questioned
her
and
she
answered
irritably
advancing
a
step
further
the
doctor
was
not
easily
discouraged
he
adverted
to
the
news
of
the
expedition
and
took
up
the
tone
of
remonstrance
which
had
been
already
adopted
by
crayford
clara
declined
to
discuss
the
question
she
rose
with
formal
politeness
and
requested
permission
to
return
to
the
house
the
doctor
attempted
no
further
resistance
by
all
means
miss
burnham
he
answered
resignedly
having
first
cast
a
look
at
crayford
which
said
plainly
stay
here
with
clara
bowed
her
acknowledgments
in
cold
silence
and
left
them
together
the
doctor
s
bright
eyes
followed
the
girl
s
wasted
yet
still
graceful
figure
as
it
slowly
receded
from
view
with
an
expression
of
grave
anxiety
which
crayford
noticed
with
grave
misgiving
on
her
side
he
said
nothing
until
clara
had
disappeared
under
the
veranda
which
ran
round
the
of
the
house
i
think
you
told
me
he
began
that
miss
burnham
has
neither
father
nor
mother
living
yes
miss
burnham
is
an
has
she
any
near
relatives
no
you
may
speak
to
me
as
her
guardian
and
her
friend
are
you
alarmed
about
her
i
am
seriously
alarmed
it
is
only
two
days
since
i
called
here
last
and
i
see
a
marked
change
in
her
for
the
worse
physically
and
morally
a
change
for
the
worse
don
t
needlessly
alarm
yourself
the
case
is
not
i
trust
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
remedy
the
great
hope
for
us
is
the
hope
that
aldersley
may
still
be
living
in
that
event
i
should
feel
no
misgivings
about
the
future
her
marriage
would
make
a
healthy
and
a
happy
woman
of
her
but
as
things
are
i
own
i
dread
that
settled
conviction
in
her
mind
that
aldersley
is
dead
and
that
her
own
death
is
soon
to
follow
in
her
present
state
of
health
this
idea
haunting
her
as
it
certainly
will
night
and
day
will
have
its
influence
on
her
body
as
well
as
on
her
mind
unless
we
can
check
the
mischief
her
last
reserves
of
strength
will
give
way
if
you
wish
for
other
advice
by
all
means
send
for
it
you
have
my
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
your
opinion
crayford
replied
for
god
s
sake
tell
me
what
can
we
do
we
can
try
a
complete
change
said
the
doctor
we
can
remove
her
at
once
from
this
she
will
refuse
to
leave
it
crayford
rejoined
i
have
more
than
once
proposed
a
change
to
her
and
she
always
says
the
doctor
paused
for
a
moment
like
a
man
collecting
his
thoughts
i
heard
something
on
my
way
here
he
proceeded
which
suggests
to
my
mind
a
method
of
meeting
the
difficulty
that
you
have
just
mentioned
unless
i
am
entirely
mistaken
miss
burnham
will
not
say
no
to
the
change
that
i
have
in
view
for
what
is
it
asked
crayford
eagerly
pardon
me
if
i
ask
you
a
question
on
my
part
before
i
reply
said
the
doctor
are
you
fortunate
enough
to
possess
any
interest
at
the
admiralty
certainly
my
father
is
in
the
secretary
s
office
and
two
of
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
are
friends
of
excellent
now
i
can
speak
out
plainly
with
little
fear
of
disappointing
you
after
what
i
have
said
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
only
change
in
miss
burnham
s
life
which
will
be
of
any
use
to
her
is
a
change
that
will
alter
the
present
tone
of
her
mind
on
the
subject
of
aldersley
place
her
in
a
position
to
discover
not
by
reference
to
her
own
distempered
fancies
and
visions
but
by
reference
to
actual
evidence
and
actual
fact
whether
aldersley
is
or
is
not
a
living
man
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
hysterical
delusions
which
now
threaten
to
fatally
undermine
her
health
even
taking
matters
at
their
worst
even
assuming
that
aldersley
has
died
in
the
arctic
seas
it
will
be
less
injurious
to
her
to
discover
this
positively
than
to
leave
her
mind
to
feed
on
its
own
morbid
superstitions
and
speculations
for
weeks
and
weeks
together
while
the
next
news
from
the
expedition
is
on
its
way
to
england
in
one
word
i
want
you
to
be
in
a
position
before
the
week
is
out
to
put
miss
burnham
s
present
conviction
to
a
practical
test
suppose
you
could
say
to
her
we
differ
my
dear
about
francis
aldersley
you
declare
without
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
it
that
he
is
certainly
dead
and
worse
still
that
he
has
died
by
the
act
of
one
of
his
brother
officers
i
assert
on
the
authority
of
the
newspaper
that
nothing
of
the
sort
has
happened
and
that
the
chances
are
all
in
favor
of
his
being
still
a
living
man
what
do
you
say
to
crossing
the
atlantic
and
deciding
which
of
us
is
right
you
or
i
do
you
think
miss
burnham
will
say
no
to
that
crayford
if
i
know
anything
of
human
nature
she
will
seize
the
opportunity
as
a
means
of
converting
you
to
a
belief
in
the
second
good
heavens
doctor
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
we
are
to
go
to
sea
and
meet
the
arctic
expedition
on
its
way
home
admirably
guessed
crayford
that
is
exactly
what
i
but
how
is
it
to
be
done
i
will
tell
you
immediately
i
mentioned
didn
t
i
that
i
had
heard
something
on
my
road
to
this
well
i
met
an
old
friend
at
my
own
gate
who
walked
with
me
a
part
of
the
way
here
last
night
my
friend
dined
with
the
admiral
at
portsmouth
among
the
guests
there
was
a
member
of
the
ministry
who
had
brought
the
news
about
the
expedition
with
him
from
london
this
gentleman
told
the
company
there
was
very
little
doubt
that
the
admiralty
would
immediately
send
out
a
to
meet
the
rescued
men
on
the
shores
of
america
and
bring
them
home
wait
a
little
crayford
nobody
knows
as
yet
under
what
rules
and
regulations
the
vessel
will
sail
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
privileged
people
have
been
received
as
passengers
or
rather
as
guests
in
her
majesty
s
ships
and
what
has
been
conceded
on
former
occasions
may
by
bare
possibility
be
conceded
now
i
can
say
no
more
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
voyage
for
yourself
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
nay
i
am
all
in
favor
of
it
on
medical
grounds
for
my
patient
what
do
you
say
will
you
write
to
your
father
and
ask
him
to
try
what
his
interest
will
do
with
his
friends
at
the
admiralty
crayford
rose
excitedly
to
her
feet
write
she
exclaimed
i
will
do
better
than
write
the
journey
to
london
is
no
great
matter
and
my
housekeeper
here
is
to
be
trusted
to
take
care
of
clara
in
my
absence
i
will
see
my
father
he
shall
make
good
use
of
his
interest
at
the
admiralty
you
may
rely
on
that
oh
my
dear
doctor
what
a
prospect
it
is
my
husband
clara
what
a
discovery
you
have
made
what
a
treasure
you
are
how
can
i
thank
you
compose
yourself
my
dear
madam
don
t
make
too
sure
of
success
we
may
consider
miss
burnham
s
objections
as
disposed
of
beforehand
but
suppose
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
say
no
in
that
case
i
shall
be
in
london
doctor
and
i
shall
go
to
them
myself
lords
are
only
men
and
men
are
not
in
the
habit
of
saying
no
to
so
they
parted
in
a
week
from
that
day
her
majesty
s
ship
sailed
for
north
america
certain
privileged
persons
specially
interested
in
the
arctic
voyagers
were
permitted
to
occupy
the
empty
on
board
on
the
list
of
these
favored
guests
of
the
ship
were
the
names
of
two
ladies
crayford
and
miss
burnham

seated
on
a
chest
with
a
piece
of
cord
in
his
hand
looking
out
idly
at
the
sea
on
the
rough
carpenter
s
table
near
him
lies
a
strange
object
to
be
left
in
such
a
place
a
woman
s
veil
what
is
the
vessel
lying
at
anchor
in
the
offing
the
vessel
is
the
dispatched
from
england
to
receive
the
surviving
officers
and
men
of
the
arctic
expedition
the
meeting
has
been
successfully
effected
on
the
shores
of
north
america
three
days
since
but
the
homeward
voyage
has
been
delayed
by
a
storm
which
has
driven
the
ship
out
of
her
course
taking
advantage
on
the
third
day
of
the
first
returning
calm
the
commander
of
the
has
anchored
off
the
coast
of
newfoundland
and
has
sent
ashore
to
increase
his
supplies
of
water
before
he
sails
for
england
the
weary
passengers
have
landed
for
a
few
hours
to
refresh
themselves
after
the
discomforts
of
the
tempest
among
them
are
the
two
ladies
the
veil
left
on
the
table
in
the
is
clara
s
veil
and
who
is
the
man
sitting
on
the
chest
with
the
cord
in
his
hand
looking
out
idly
at
the
sea
the
man
is
the
only
cheerful
person
in
the
ship
s
company
in
other
words
john
want
still
reposing
on
the
chest
our
friend
who
never
grumbles
is
surprised
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
sailor
at
the
door
look
sharp
with
your
work
there
john
want
says
the
sailor
lieutenant
crayford
is
just
coming
in
to
look
after
with
this
warning
the
messenger
disappears
again
john
want
rises
with
a
groan
turns
the
chest
up
on
one
end
and
begins
to
fasten
the
cord
round
it
the
ship
s
cook
is
not
a
man
to
look
back
on
his
rescue
with
the
feeling
of
unmitigated
satisfaction
which
animates
his
companions
in
trouble
on
the
contrary
he
is
ungratefully
disposed
to
regret
the
north
pole
if
i
had
only
known
thus
runs
the
train
of
thought
in
the
mind
of
john
want
if
i
had
only
known
before
i
was
rescued
that
i
was
to
be
brought
to
this
place
i
believe
i
should
have
preferred
staying
at
the
north
pole
i
was
very
happy
keeping
up
everybody
s
spirits
at
the
north
pole
taking
one
thing
with
another
i
think
i
must
have
been
very
comfortable
at
the
north
pole
if
i
had
only
known
it
another
man
in
my
place
might
be
inclined
to
say
that
this
newfoundland
was
rather
a
sloppy
slimy
draughty
fishy
sort
of
a
habitation
to
take
shelter
in
another
man
might
object
to
perpetual
newfoundland
fogs
perpetual
newfoundland
and
perpetual
newfoundland
dogs
we
had
some
very
nice
bears
at
the
north
pole
never
mind
it
s
all
one
to
me
don
t
have
you
done
cording
that
box
this
time
the
voice
is
a
voice
of
authority
the
man
at
the
doorway
is
lieutenant
crayford
himself
john
want
answers
his
officer
in
his
own
cheerful
way
i
ve
done
it
as
well
as
i
can
sir
but
the
damp
of
this
place
is
beginning
to
tell
upon
our
very
ropes
i
say
nothing
about
our
lungs
i
only
say
our
crayford
answers
sharply
he
seems
to
have
lost
his
former
relish
for
the
humor
of
john
want
pooh
to
look
at
your
wry
face
one
would
think
that
our
rescue
from
the
arctic
regions
was
a
downright
misfortune
you
deserve
to
be
sent
back
i
could
be
just
as
cheerful
as
ever
sir
if
i
sent
back
again
i
hope
i
m
thankful
but
i
don
t
like
to
hear
the
north
pole
run
down
in
such
a
fishy
place
as
this
it
was
very
clean
and
snowy
at
the
north
pole
and
it
s
very
damp
and
sandy
here
do
you
never
miss
your
sir
do
it
mightn
t
have
been
strong
but
it
was
very
hot
and
the
cold
seemed
to
give
it
a
kind
of
a
meaty
flavor
as
it
went
down
was
it
you
that
was
so
long
last
night
sir
i
don
t
presume
to
say
anything
against
the
air
of
these
latitudes
but
i
should
be
glad
to
know
it
wasn
t
you
that
was
so
hollow
would
you
be
so
obliging
as
just
to
feel
the
state
of
these
ropes
with
the
ends
of
your
fingers
sir
you
can
dry
them
afterward
on
the
back
of
my
you
ought
to
have
a
stick
laid
on
the
back
of
your
jacket
take
that
box
down
to
the
boat
directly
you
croaking
vagabond
you
would
have
grumbled
in
the
garden
of
the
philosopher
of
the
expedition
was
not
a
man
to
be
silenced
by
referring
him
to
the
garden
of
eden
paradise
itself
was
not
perfect
to
john
want
i
hope
i
could
be
cheerful
anywhere
sir
said
the
ship
s
cook
but
you
mark
my
words
there
must
have
been
a
deal
of
troublesome
work
with
the
in
the
garden
of
having
entered
that
unanswerable
protest
john
want
shouldered
the
box
and
drifted
drearily
out
of
the
left
by
himself
crayford
looked
at
his
watch
and
called
to
a
sailor
outside
where
are
the
ladies
he
asked
mrs
crayford
is
coming
this
way
sir
she
was
just
behind
you
when
you
came
is
miss
burnham
with
her
no
sir
miss
burnham
is
down
on
the
beach
with
the
passengers
i
heard
the
young
lady
asking
after
you
asking
after
me
crayford
considered
with
himself
as
he
repeated
the
words
he
added
in
lower
and
graver
tones
you
had
better
tell
miss
burnham
you
have
seen
me
the
man
made
his
salute
and
went
out
crayford
took
a
turn
in
the
rescued
from
death
in
the
arctic
wastes
and
reunited
to
a
beautiful
wife
the
lieutenant
looked
nevertheless
unaccountably
anxious
and
depressed
what
could
he
be
thinking
of
he
was
thinking
of
clara
on
the
first
day
when
the
rescued
men
were
received
on
board
the
clara
had
embarrassed
and
distressed
not
crayford
only
but
the
other
officers
of
the
expedition
as
well
by
the
manner
in
which
she
questioned
them
on
the
subject
of
francis
aldersley
and
richard
wardour
she
had
shown
no
signs
of
dismay
or
despair
when
she
heard
that
no
news
had
been
received
of
the
two
missing
men
she
had
even
smiled
sadly
to
herself
when
crayford
out
of
compassionate
regard
for
her
declared
that
he
and
his
comrades
had
not
given
up
the
hope
of
seeing
frank
and
wardour
yet
it
was
only
when
the
lieutenant
had
expressed
himself
in
those
terms
and
when
it
was
hoped
that
the
painful
subject
had
been
dismissed
that
clara
had
startled
every
one
present
by
announcing
that
she
had
something
still
to
say
in
relation
to
frank
and
wardour
which
had
not
been
said
yet
though
she
spoke
guardedly
her
next
words
revealed
suspicions
of
foul
play
lurking
in
her
mind
exactly
reflecting
similar
suspicions
lurking
in
crayford
s
mind
which
so
distressed
the
lieutenant
and
so
surprised
his
comrades
as
to
render
them
quite
incapable
of
answering
her
the
warnings
of
the
storm
which
shortly
afterward
broke
over
the
vessel
were
then
visible
in
sea
and
sky
crayford
made
them
his
excuse
for
abruptly
leaving
the
cabin
in
which
the
conversation
had
taken
place
his
brother
officers
profiting
by
his
example
pleaded
their
duties
on
deck
and
followed
him
out
on
the
next
day
and
the
next
the
tempest
still
raged
and
the
passengers
were
not
able
to
leave
their
but
now
when
the
weather
had
moderated
and
the
ship
had
anchored
now
when
officers
and
passengers
alike
were
on
shore
with
leisure
time
at
their
disposal
clara
had
opportunities
of
returning
to
the
subject
of
the
lost
men
and
of
asking
questions
in
relation
to
them
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
crayford
to
plead
an
excuse
for
not
answering
her
how
was
he
to
meet
those
questions
how
could
he
still
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
these
were
the
reflections
which
now
troubled
crayford
and
which
presented
him
after
his
rescue
in
the
strangely
inappropriate
character
of
a
depressed
and
anxious
man
his
brother
officers
as
he
well
knew
looked
to
him
to
take
the
chief
responsibility
if
he
declined
to
accept
it
he
would
instantly
confirm
the
horrible
suspicion
in
clara
s
mind
the
emergency
must
be
met
but
how
to
meet
it
at
once
honorably
and
mercifully
was
more
than
crayford
could
tell
he
was
still
lost
in
his
own
gloomy
thoughts
when
his
wife
entered
the
turning
to
look
at
her
he
saw
his
own
perturbations
and
anxieties
plainly
reflected
in
crayford
s
face
have
you
seen
anything
of
clara
he
asked
is
she
still
on
the
beach
she
is
following
me
to
this
place
crayford
replied
i
have
been
speaking
to
her
this
morning
she
is
just
as
resolute
as
ever
to
insist
on
your
telling
her
of
the
circumstances
under
which
frank
is
missing
as
things
are
you
have
no
alternative
but
to
answer
help
me
to
answer
her
lucy
tell
me
before
she
comes
in
how
this
dreadful
suspicion
first
took
possession
of
her
all
she
could
possibly
have
known
when
we
left
england
was
that
the
two
men
were
appointed
to
separate
ships
what
could
have
led
her
to
suspect
that
they
had
come
together
she
was
firmly
persuaded
william
that
they
come
together
when
the
expedition
left
england
and
she
had
read
in
books
of
arctic
travel
of
men
left
behind
by
their
comrades
on
the
march
and
of
men
adrift
on
with
her
mind
full
of
these
images
and
forebodings
she
saw
frank
and
wardour
or
dreamed
of
them
in
one
of
her
attacks
of
trance
i
was
by
her
side
i
heard
what
she
said
at
the
time
she
warned
frank
that
wardour
had
discovered
the
truth
she
called
out
to
him
while
you
can
stand
keep
with
the
other
men
frank
good
god
cried
crayford
i
warned
him
myself
almost
in
those
very
words
the
last
time
i
saw
him
don
t
acknowledge
it
william
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
what
you
have
just
told
me
she
will
not
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
startling
coincidence
and
nothing
more
she
will
accept
it
as
positive
confirmation
of
the
faith
the
miserable
superstitious
faith
that
is
in
her
so
long
as
you
don
t
actually
know
that
frank
is
dead
and
that
he
has
died
by
wardour
s
hand
deny
what
she
says
mislead
her
for
her
own
sake
dispute
all
her
conclusions
as
i
dispute
them
help
me
to
raise
her
to
the
better
and
nobler
belief
in
the
mercy
of
god
she
stopped
and
looked
round
nervously
at
the
doorway
hush
she
whispered
do
as
i
have
told
you
clara
is
chapter
clara
stopped
at
the
doorway
looking
backward
and
forward
distrustfully
between
the
husband
and
wife
entering
the
and
approaching
crayford
she
took
his
arm
and
led
him
away
a
few
steps
from
the
place
in
which
crayford
was
standing
there
is
no
storm
now
and
there
are
no
duties
to
be
done
on
board
the
ship
she
said
with
the
faint
sad
smile
which
it
wrung
crayford
s
heart
to
see
you
are
lucy
s
husband
and
you
have
an
interest
in
me
for
lucy
s
sake
don
t
shrink
on
that
account
from
giving
me
pain
i
can
bear
pain
friend
and
brother
will
you
believe
that
i
have
courage
enough
to
hear
the
worst
will
you
promise
not
to
deceive
me
about
frank
the
gentle
resignation
in
her
voice
the
sad
pleading
in
her
look
shook
crayford
s
at
the
outset
he
answered
her
in
the
worst
possible
manner
he
answered
evasively
my
dear
clara
he
said
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
suspect
me
of
deceiving
you
she
looked
him
searchingly
in
the
face
then
glanced
with
renewed
distrust
at
crayford
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
before
any
of
the
three
could
speak
again
they
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
one
of
crayford
s
brother
officers
followed
by
two
sailors
carrying
a
hamper
between
them
crayford
instantly
dropped
clara
s
arm
and
seized
the
welcome
opportunity
of
speaking
of
other
things
any
instructions
from
the
ship
steventon
he
asked
approaching
the
officer
verbal
instructions
only
steventon
replied
the
ship
will
sail
with
the
we
shall
fire
a
gun
to
collect
the
people
and
send
another
boat
ashore
in
the
meantime
here
are
some
refreshments
for
the
passengers
the
ship
is
in
a
state
of
confusion
the
ladies
will
eat
their
luncheon
more
comfortably
hearing
this
crayford
took
opportunity
of
silencing
clara
next
come
my
dear
she
said
let
us
lay
the
cloth
before
the
gentlemen
come
clara
was
too
seriously
bent
on
attaining
the
object
which
she
had
in
view
to
be
silenced
in
that
way
i
will
help
you
directly
she
answered
then
crossed
the
room
and
addressed
herself
to
the
officer
whose
name
was
steventon
can
you
spare
me
a
few
minutes
she
asked
i
have
something
to
say
to
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
miss
answering
in
those
words
steventon
dismissed
the
two
sailors
crayford
looked
anxiously
at
her
husband
crayford
whispered
to
her
don
t
be
alarmed
about
steventon
i
have
cautioned
him
his
discretion
is
to
be
depended
clara
beckoned
to
crayford
to
return
to
her
i
will
not
keep
you
long
she
said
i
will
promise
not
to
distress
steventon
young
as
i
am
you
shall
both
find
that
i
am
capable
of
i
won
t
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
story
of
your
past
sufferings
i
only
want
to
be
sure
that
i
am
right
about
one
thing
i
mean
about
what
happened
at
the
time
when
the
exploring
party
was
dispatched
in
search
of
help
as
i
understand
it
you
cast
lots
among
yourselves
who
was
to
go
with
the
party
and
who
was
to
remain
behind
frank
cast
the
lot
to
she
paused
shuddering
and
richard
wardour
she
went
on
cast
the
lot
to
remain
behind
on
your
honor
as
officers
and
gentlemen
is
this
the
truth
on
my
honor
crayford
answered
it
is
the
on
my
honor
steventon
repeated
it
is
the
she
looked
at
them
carefully
considering
her
next
words
before
she
spoke
again
you
both
drew
the
lot
to
stay
in
the
huts
she
said
addressing
crayford
and
steventon
and
you
are
both
here
richard
wardour
drew
the
lot
to
stay
and
richard
wardour
is
not
here
how
does
his
name
come
to
be
with
frank
s
on
the
list
of
the
missing
the
question
was
a
dangerous
one
to
answer
steventon
left
it
to
crayford
to
reply
once
again
he
answered
evasively
it
doesn
t
follow
my
dear
he
said
that
the
two
men
were
missing
together
because
their
names
happen
to
come
together
on
the
clara
instantly
drew
the
inevitable
conclusion
from
that
reply
frank
is
missing
from
the
party
of
relief
she
said
am
i
to
understand
that
wardour
is
missing
from
the
huts
both
crayford
and
steventon
hesitated
crayford
cast
one
indignant
look
at
them
and
told
the
necessary
lie
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
yes
she
said
wardour
is
missing
from
the
quickly
as
she
had
spoken
she
had
still
spoken
too
late
clara
had
noticed
the
momentary
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
two
officers
she
turned
to
steventon
i
trust
to
your
honor
she
said
quietly
am
i
right
or
wrong
in
believing
that
crayford
is
mistaken
she
had
addressed
herself
to
the
right
man
of
the
two
steventon
had
no
wife
present
to
exercise
authority
over
him
steventon
put
on
his
honor
and
fairly
forced
to
say
something
owned
the
truth
wardour
had
replaced
an
officer
whom
accident
had
disabled
from
accompanying
the
party
of
relief
and
wardour
and
frank
were
missing
together
clara
looked
at
crayford
you
hear
she
said
it
is
you
who
are
mistaken
not
i
what
you
call
accident
what
i
call
fate
brought
richard
wardour
and
frank
together
as
members
of
the
same
expedition
after
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
again
turned
to
steventon
and
surprised
him
by
changing
the
painful
subject
of
the
conversation
of
her
own
accord
have
you
been
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
she
asked
i
have
never
been
in
the
highlands
the
lieutenant
replied
have
you
ever
read
in
books
about
the
highlands
of
such
a
thing
as
the
second
sight
do
you
believe
in
the
second
sight
steventon
politely
declined
to
commit
himself
to
a
direct
reply
i
don
t
know
what
i
might
have
done
if
i
had
ever
been
in
the
highlands
he
said
as
it
is
i
have
had
no
opportunities
of
giving
the
subject
any
serious
i
won
t
put
your
credulity
to
the
test
clara
proceeded
i
won
t
ask
you
to
believe
anything
more
extraordinary
than
that
i
had
a
strange
dream
in
england
not
very
long
since
my
dream
showed
me
what
you
have
just
acknowledged
and
more
than
that
how
did
the
two
missing
men
come
to
be
parted
from
their
companions
were
they
lost
by
pure
accident
or
were
they
deliberately
left
behind
on
the
march
crayford
made
a
last
vain
effort
to
check
her
inquiries
at
the
point
which
they
had
now
reached
neither
steventon
nor
i
were
members
of
the
party
of
relief
he
said
how
are
we
to
answer
you
your
brother
officers
who
members
of
the
party
must
have
told
you
what
happened
clara
rejoined
i
only
ask
you
and
steventon
to
tell
me
what
they
told
crayford
interposed
again
with
a
practical
suggestion
this
time
the
luncheon
is
not
unpacked
yet
she
said
come
clara
this
is
our
business
and
the
time
is
the
luncheon
can
wait
a
few
minutes
longer
clara
answered
bear
with
my
obstinacy
she
went
on
laying
her
hand
caressingly
on
crayford
s
shoulder
tell
me
how
those
two
came
to
be
separated
from
the
rest
you
have
always
been
the
kindest
of
friends
don
t
begin
to
be
cruel
to
me
now
the
tone
in
which
she
made
her
entreaty
to
crayford
went
straight
to
the
sailor
s
heart
he
gave
up
the
hopeless
struggle
he
let
her
see
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
on
the
third
day
out
he
said
frank
s
strength
failed
him
he
fell
behind
the
rest
from
surely
they
waited
for
him
it
was
a
serious
risk
to
wait
for
him
my
child
their
lives
and
the
lives
of
the
men
they
had
left
in
the
huts
depended
in
that
dreadful
climate
on
their
pushing
on
but
frank
was
a
favorite
they
waited
half
a
day
to
give
frank
the
chance
of
recovering
his
there
he
stopped
there
the
imprudence
into
which
his
fondness
for
clara
had
led
him
showed
itself
plainly
and
closed
his
lips
it
was
too
late
to
take
refuge
in
silence
clara
was
determined
on
hearing
more
she
questioned
steventon
next
did
frank
go
on
again
after
the
s
rest
she
asked
he
tried
to
go
on
and
failed
what
did
the
men
do
when
he
failed
did
they
turn
cowards
did
they
desert
frank
she
had
purposely
used
language
which
might
irritate
steventon
into
answering
her
plainly
he
was
a
young
man
he
fell
into
the
snare
that
she
had
set
for
him
not
one
among
them
was
a
coward
miss
burnham
he
replied
warmly
you
are
speaking
cruelly
and
unjustly
of
as
brave
a
set
of
fellows
as
ever
lived
the
strongest
man
among
them
set
the
example
he
volunteered
to
stay
by
frank
and
to
bring
him
on
in
the
track
of
the
exploring
there
steventon
stopped
conscious
on
his
side
that
he
had
said
too
much
would
she
ask
him
who
this
volunteer
was
no
she
went
straight
on
to
the
most
embarrassing
question
that
she
had
put
yet
referring
to
the
volunteer
as
if
steventon
had
already
mentioned
his
name
what
made
richard
wardour
so
ready
to
risk
his
life
for
frank
s
sake
she
said
to
crayford
did
he
do
it
out
of
friendship
for
frank
surely
you
can
tell
me
that
carry
your
memory
back
to
the
days
when
you
were
all
living
in
the
huts
were
frank
and
wardour
friends
at
that
time
did
you
never
hear
any
angry
words
pass
between
them
there
crayford
saw
her
opportunity
of
giving
her
husband
a
timely
hint
my
dear
child
she
said
how
can
you
expect
him
to
remember
that
there
must
have
been
plenty
of
quarrels
among
the
men
all
shut
up
together
and
all
weary
of
each
other
s
company
no
plenty
of
quarrels
crayford
repeated
and
every
one
of
them
made
up
and
every
one
of
them
made
up
again
crayford
reiterated
in
her
turn
there
a
plainer
answer
than
that
you
can
t
wish
to
have
now
are
you
satisfied
steventon
come
and
lend
a
hand
as
you
say
at
sea
with
the
hamper
clara
won
t
help
me
william
don
t
stand
there
doing
nothing
this
hamper
holds
a
great
deal
we
must
have
a
division
of
labor
your
division
shall
be
laying
the
tablecloth
don
t
handle
it
in
that
clumsy
way
you
unfold
a
as
if
you
were
unfurling
a
sail
put
the
knives
on
the
right
and
the
forks
on
the
left
and
the
napkin
and
the
bread
between
them
clara
if
you
are
not
hungry
in
this
fine
air
you
ought
to
be
come
and
do
your
duty
come
and
have
some
lunch
she
looked
up
as
she
spoke
clara
appeared
to
have
yielded
at
last
to
the
conspiracy
to
keep
her
in
the
dark
she
had
returned
slowly
to
the
doorway
and
she
was
standing
alone
on
the
threshold
looking
out
approaching
her
to
lead
her
to
the
crayford
could
hear
that
she
was
speaking
softly
to
herself
she
was
repeating
the
farewell
words
which
richard
wardour
had
spoken
to
her
at
the
ball
a
time
may
come
when
i
shall
forgive
but
the
man
who
has
robbed
me
of
you
shall
rue
the
day
when
you
and
he
first
oh
frank
frank
does
richard
still
live
with
your
blood
on
his
conscience
and
my
image
in
his
heart
her
lips
suddenly
closed
she
started
and
drew
back
from
the
doorway
trembling
violently
crayford
looked
out
at
the
quiet
seaward
view
anything
there
that
frightens
you
my
dear
she
asked
i
can
see
nothing
except
the
boats
drawn
up
on
the
can
see
nothing
either
and
yet
you
are
trembling
as
if
there
was
something
dreadful
in
the
view
from
this
there
something
dreadful
i
feel
it
though
i
see
nothing
i
feel
it
nearer
and
nearer
in
the
empty
air
darker
and
darker
in
the
sunny
light
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
take
me
away
no
not
out
on
the
beach
i
can
t
pass
the
door
somewhere
else
somewhere
else
crayford
looked
round
her
and
noticed
a
second
door
at
the
inner
end
of
the
she
spoke
to
her
husband
see
where
that
door
leads
to
crayford
opened
the
door
it
led
into
a
desolate
inclosure
half
garden
half
yard
some
nets
stretched
on
poles
were
hanging
up
to
dry
no
other
objects
were
visible
not
a
living
creature
appeared
in
the
place
it
doesn
t
look
very
inviting
my
dear
said
crayford
i
am
at
your
service
however
what
do
you
say
she
offered
her
arm
to
clara
as
she
spoke
clara
refused
it
she
took
crayford
s
arm
and
clung
to
him
i
m
frightened
dreadfully
frightened
she
said
to
him
faintly
you
keep
with
me
a
woman
is
no
protection
i
want
to
be
with
she
looked
round
again
at
the
doorway
oh
she
whispered
i
m
cold
all
over
i
m
frozen
with
fear
of
this
place
come
into
the
yard
come
into
the
yard
leave
her
to
me
said
crayford
to
his
wife
i
will
call
you
if
she
doesn
t
get
better
in
the
open
he
took
her
out
at
once
and
closed
the
yard
door
behind
them
mr
steventon
do
you
understand
this
asked
crayford
what
can
she
possibly
be
frightened
of
she
put
the
question
still
looking
mechanically
at
the
door
by
which
her
husband
and
clara
had
gone
out
receiving
no
reply
she
glanced
round
at
steventon
he
was
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
with
his
eyes
fixed
attentively
on
the
view
from
the
main
doorway
of
the
crayford
looked
where
steventon
was
looking
this
time
there
was
something
visible
she
saw
the
shadow
of
a
human
figure
projected
on
the
stretch
of
smooth
yellow
sand
in
front
of
the
in
a
moment
more
the
figure
appeared
a
man
came
slowly
into
view
and
stopped
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
chapter
the
man
was
a
sinister
and
terrible
object
to
look
at
his
eyes
glared
like
the
eyes
of
a
wild
animal
his
head
was
bare
his
long
gray
hair
was
torn
and
tangled
his
miserable
garments
hung
about
him
in
rags
he
stood
in
the
doorway
a
speechless
figure
of
misery
and
want
staring
at
the
table
like
a
hungry
dog
steventon
spoke
to
him
who
are
you
he
answered
in
a
hoarse
hollow
voice
a
starving
he
advanced
a
few
steps
slowly
and
painfully
as
if
he
were
sinking
under
fatigue
throw
me
some
bones
from
the
table
he
said
give
me
my
share
along
with
the
there
was
madness
as
well
as
hunger
in
his
eyes
while
he
spoke
those
words
steventon
placed
crayford
behind
him
so
that
he
might
be
easily
able
to
protect
her
in
case
of
need
and
beckoned
to
two
sailors
who
were
passing
the
door
of
the
at
the
time
give
the
man
some
bread
and
meat
he
said
and
wait
near
the
outcast
seized
on
the
bread
and
meat
with
lean
hands
that
looked
like
claws
after
his
first
mouthful
of
the
food
he
stopped
considered
vacantly
with
himself
and
broke
the
bread
and
meat
into
two
portions
one
portion
he
put
into
an
old
canvas
wallet
that
hung
over
his
shoulder
the
other
he
devoured
voraciously
steventon
questioned
him
where
do
you
come
from
from
the
wrecked
steventon
turned
to
crayford
there
may
be
some
truth
in
the
poor
wretch
s
story
he
said
i
heard
something
of
a
strange
boat
having
been
cast
on
the
beach
thirty
or
forty
miles
higher
up
the
coast
when
were
you
wrecked
my
man
the
starving
creature
looked
up
from
his
food
and
made
an
effort
to
collect
his
thoughts
to
exert
his
memory
it
was
not
to
be
done
he
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
his
language
when
he
spoke
was
as
wild
as
his
looks
i
can
t
tell
you
he
said
i
can
t
get
the
wash
of
the
sea
out
of
my
ears
i
can
t
get
the
shining
stars
all
night
and
the
burning
sun
all
day
out
of
my
brain
when
was
i
wrecked
when
was
i
first
adrift
in
the
boat
when
did
i
get
the
tiller
in
my
hand
and
fight
against
hunger
and
sleep
when
did
the
gnawing
in
my
breast
and
the
burning
in
my
head
first
begin
i
have
lost
all
reckoning
of
it
i
can
t
think
i
can
t
sleep
i
can
t
get
the
wash
of
the
sea
out
of
my
ears
what
are
you
baiting
me
with
questions
for
let
me
eat
even
the
sailors
pitied
him
the
sailors
asked
leave
of
their
officer
to
add
a
little
drink
to
his
meal
we
ve
got
a
drop
of
grog
with
us
sir
in
a
bottle
may
we
give
it
to
him
certainly
he
took
the
bottle
fiercely
as
he
had
taken
the
food
drank
a
little
stopped
and
considered
with
himself
again
he
held
up
the
bottle
to
the
light
and
marking
how
much
liquor
it
contained
carefully
drank
half
of
it
only
this
done
he
put
the
bottle
in
his
wallet
along
with
the
food
are
you
saving
it
up
for
another
time
said
steventon
i
m
saving
it
up
the
man
answered
never
mind
what
for
that
s
my
he
looked
round
the
as
he
made
that
reply
and
noticed
crayford
for
the
first
time
a
woman
among
you
he
said
is
she
english
is
she
young
let
me
look
closer
at
he
advanced
a
few
steps
toward
the
table
don
t
be
afraid
crayford
said
steventon
i
am
not
afraid
crayford
replied
he
frightened
me
at
first
he
interests
me
now
let
him
speak
to
me
if
he
wishes
it
he
never
spoke
he
stood
in
dead
silence
looking
long
and
anxiously
at
the
beautiful
englishwoman
well
said
steventon
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
drew
back
again
with
a
heavy
sigh
no
he
said
to
himself
that
s
not
face
no
not
found
crayford
s
interest
was
strongly
excited
she
ventured
to
speak
to
him
who
is
it
you
want
to
find
she
asked
your
wife
he
shook
his
head
again
who
then
what
is
she
like
he
answered
that
question
in
words
his
hoarse
hollow
voice
softened
little
by
little
into
sorrowful
and
gentle
tones
young
he
said
with
a
fair
sad
face
with
kind
tender
eyes
with
a
soft
clear
voice
young
and
loving
and
merciful
i
keep
her
face
in
my
mind
though
i
can
keep
nothing
else
i
must
wander
wander
wander
restless
sleepless
homeless
till
i
find
over
the
ice
and
over
the
snow
tossing
on
the
sea
tramping
over
the
land
awake
all
night
awake
all
day
wander
wander
wander
till
i
find
he
waved
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
farewell
and
turned
wearily
to
go
out
at
the
same
moment
crayford
opened
the
yard
door
i
think
you
had
better
come
to
clara
he
began
and
checked
himself
noticing
the
stranger
who
is
that
the
shipwrecked
man
hearing
another
voice
in
the
room
looked
round
slowly
over
his
shoulder
struck
by
his
appearance
crayford
advanced
a
little
nearer
to
him
crayford
spoke
to
her
husband
as
he
passed
her
it
s
only
a
poor
mad
creature
william
she
whispered
shipwrecked
and
mad
crayford
repeated
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
man
am
in
my
right
senses
he
suddenly
sprang
on
the
outcast
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
richard
wardour
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
fury
alive
alive
to
answer
for
frank
the
man
struggled
crayford
held
him
where
is
frank
he
said
you
villain
where
is
frank
the
man
resisted
no
longer
he
repeated
vacantly
villain
and
where
is
frank
as
the
name
escaped
his
lips
clara
appeared
at
the
open
yard
door
and
hurried
into
the
room
i
heard
richard
s
name
she
said
i
heard
frank
s
name
what
does
it
mean
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
outcast
renewed
the
struggle
to
free
himself
with
a
sudden
frenzy
of
strength
which
crayford
was
not
able
to
resist
he
broke
away
before
the
sailors
could
come
to
their
officer
s
assistance
down
the
length
of
the
room
he
and
clara
met
one
another
face
to
face
a
new
light
sparkled
in
the
poor
wretch
s
eyes
a
cry
of
recognition
burst
from
his
lips
he
flung
one
hand
up
wildly
in
the
air
found
he
shouted
and
rushed
out
to
the
beach
before
any
of
the
men
present
could
stop
him
crayford
put
her
arms
round
clara
and
held
her
up
she
had
not
made
a
movement
she
had
not
spoken
a
word
the
sight
of
wardour
s
face
had
petrified
her
the
minutes
passed
and
there
rose
a
sudden
burst
of
cheering
from
the
sailors
on
the
beach
near
the
spot
where
the
fishermen
s
boats
were
drawn
up
every
man
left
his
work
every
man
waved
his
cap
in
the
air
the
passengers
near
at
hand
caught
the
infection
of
enthusiasm
and
joined
the
crew
a
moment
more
and
richard
wardour
appeared
again
in
the
doorway
carrying
a
man
in
his
arms
he
staggered
breathless
with
the
effort
that
he
was
making
to
the
place
where
clara
stood
held
up
in
crayford
s
arms
saved
clara
he
cried
saved
for
he
released
the
man
and
placed
him
in
clara
s
arms
frank
and
weary
but
living
saved
saved
for
now
clara
cried
crayford
which
of
us
is
right
i
who
believed
in
the
mercy
of
god
or
you
who
believed
in
a
dream
she
never
answered
she
clung
to
frank
in
speechless
ecstasy
she
never
even
looked
at
the
man
who
had
preserved
him
in
the
first
absorbing
joy
of
seeing
frank
alive
step
by
step
slower
and
slower
richard
wardour
drew
back
and
left
them
by
themselves
i
may
rest
now
he
said
faintly
i
may
sleep
at
last
the
task
is
done
the
struggle
is
his
last
reserves
of
strength
had
been
given
to
frank
he
stopped
he
staggered
his
hands
waved
feebly
in
search
of
support
but
for
one
faithful
friend
he
would
have
fallen
crayford
caught
him
crayford
laid
his
old
comrade
gently
on
some
sails
strewn
in
a
corner
and
pillowed
wardour
s
weary
head
on
his
own
bosom
the
tears
streamed
over
his
face
richard
dear
richard
he
said
remember
and
forgive
richard
neither
heeded
nor
heard
him
his
dim
eyes
still
looked
across
the
room
at
clara
and
frank
i
have
made
happy
he
murmured
i
may
lay
down
my
weary
head
now
on
the
mother
earth
that
hushes
all
her
children
to
rest
at
last
sink
heart
sink
sink
to
rest
oh
look
at
them
he
said
to
crayford
with
a
burst
of
grief
they
have
forgotten
it
was
true
the
interest
was
all
with
the
two
lovers
frank
was
young
and
handsome
and
popular
officers
passengers
and
sailors
they
all
crowded
round
frank
they
all
forgot
the
martyred
man
who
had
saved
him
the
man
who
was
dying
in
crayford
s
arms
crayford
tried
once
more
to
attract
his
attention
to
win
his
recognition
while
there
was
yet
time
richard
speak
to
me
speak
to
your
old
friend
he
look
round
he
vacantly
repeated
crayford
s
last
word
friend
he
said
my
eyes
are
dim
friend
my
mind
is
dull
i
have
lost
all
memories
but
the
memory
of
dead
thoughts
all
dead
thoughts
but
that
one
and
yet
you
look
at
me
kindly
why
has
your
face
gone
down
with
the
wreck
of
all
the
rest
he
paused
his
face
changed
his
thoughts
drifted
back
from
present
to
past
he
looked
at
crayford
vacantly
lost
in
the
terrible
remembrances
that
were
rising
in
him
as
the
shadows
rise
with
the
coming
night
hark
ye
friend
he
whispered
never
let
frank
know
it
there
was
a
time
when
the
fiend
within
me
hungered
for
his
life
i
had
my
hands
on
the
boat
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
tempter
speaking
to
me
launch
it
and
leave
him
to
die
i
waited
with
my
hands
on
the
boat
and
my
eyes
on
the
place
where
he
slept
leave
him
leave
him
the
voice
whispered
love
him
the
lad
s
voice
answered
moaning
and
murmuring
in
his
sleep
love
him
clara
for
helping
i
heard
the
morning
wind
come
up
in
the
silence
over
the
great
deep
far
and
near
i
heard
the
groaning
of
the
floating
ice
floating
floating
to
the
clear
water
and
the
balmy
air
and
the
wicked
voice
floated
away
with
it
away
away
away
forever
love
him
love
him
clara
for
helping
no
wind
could
float
that
away
love
him
clara
his
voice
sank
into
silence
his
head
dropped
on
crayford
s
breast
frank
saw
it
frank
struggled
up
on
his
bleeding
feet
and
parted
the
friendly
throng
round
him
frank
had
not
forgotten
the
man
who
had
saved
him
let
me
go
to
him
he
cried
i
must
and
will
go
to
him
clara
come
with
clara
and
steventon
supported
him
between
them
he
fell
on
his
knees
at
wardour
s
side
he
put
his
hand
on
wardour
s
bosom
richard
the
weary
eyes
opened
again
the
sinking
voice
was
heard
feebly
once
more
ah
poor
frank
i
didn
t
forget
you
frank
when
i
came
here
to
beg
i
remembered
you
lying
down
outside
in
the
shadow
of
the
boats
i
saved
you
your
share
of
the
food
and
drink
too
weak
to
get
at
it
now
a
little
rest
frank
i
shall
soon
be
strong
enough
to
carry
you
down
to
the
the
end
was
near
they
all
saw
it
now
the
men
reverently
uncovered
their
heads
in
the
presence
of
death
in
an
agony
of
despair
frank
appealed
to
the
friends
round
him
get
something
to
strengthen
him
for
god
s
sake
oh
men
men
i
should
never
have
been
here
but
for
him
he
has
given
all
his
strength
to
my
weakness
and
now
see
how
strong
i
am
and
how
weak
is
clara
i
held
by
his
arm
all
over
the
ice
and
snow
kept
watch
when
i
was
senseless
in
the
open
boat
hand
dragged
me
out
of
the
waves
when
we
were
wrecked
speak
to
him
clara
speak
to
him
his
voice
failed
him
and
his
head
dropped
on
wardour
s
breast
she
spoke
as
well
as
her
tears
would
let
her
richard
have
you
forgotten
me
he
rallied
at
the
sound
of
that
beloved
voice
he
looked
up
at
her
as
she
knelt
at
his
head
forgotten
you
still
looking
at
her
he
lifted
his
hand
with
an
effort
and
laid
it
on
frank
should
i
have
been
strong
enough
to
save
him
if
i
could
have
forgotten
you
he
waited
a
moment
and
turned
his
face
feebly
toward
crayford
stay
he
said
someone
was
here
and
spoke
to
a
faint
light
of
recognition
glimmered
in
his
eyes
ah
crayford
i
recollect
now
dear
crayford
come
nearer
my
mind
clears
but
my
eyes
grow
dim
you
will
remember
me
kindly
for
frank
s
sake
poor
frank
why
does
he
hide
his
face
is
he
crying
nearer
clara
i
want
to
look
my
last
at
my
sister
clara
kiss
me
sister
kiss
me
before
i
die
she
stooped
and
kissed
his
forehead
a
faint
smile
trembled
on
his
lips
it
passed
away
and
stillness
possessed
the
face
the
stillness
of
death
crayford
s
voice
was
heard
in
the
silence
the
loss
is
ours
he
said
the
gain
is
his
he
has
won
the
greatest
of
all
conquests
the
conquest
of
himself
and
he
has
died
in
the
moment
of
victory
not
one
of
us
here
but
may
live
to
envy
glorious
the
distant
report
of
a
gun
came
from
the
ship
in
the
offing
and
signaled
the
return
to
england
and
to
home
