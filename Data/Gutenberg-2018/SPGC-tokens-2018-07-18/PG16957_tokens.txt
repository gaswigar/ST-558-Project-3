honourable
lord
elcho
in
gratitude
for
many
seasons
of
excellent
sport
with
his
hounds
on

author
preface
the
author
gladly
avails
himself
of
the
convenience
of
a
preface
for
stating
that
it
will
be
seen
at
the
close
of
the
work
why
he
makes
such
a
characterless
character
as
sponge
the
hero
of
his
tale
he
will
be
glad
if
it
serves
to
put
the
rising
generation
on
their
guard
against
specious
promiscuous
acquaintance
and
trains
them
on
to
the
noble
sport
of
hunting

chapter
i
our
hero
illustration
it
was
a
murky
october
day
that
the
hero
of
our
tale
sponge
or
soapey
sponge
as
his
friends
call
him
was
seen
mizzling
along
oxford
street
wending
his
way
to
the
west
not
that
there
was
anything
unusual
in
sponge
being
seen
in
oxford
street
for
when
in
town
his
daily
perambulations
consist
of
a
circuit
commencing
from
the
bantam
hotel
in
bond
street
into
piccadilly
through
leicester
square
and
so
on
to
aldridge
in
martin
lane
thence
by
moore
shop
and
on
through
some
of
those
ambiguous
and
tortuous
streets
that
appearing
to
lead
all
ways
at
once
and
none
in
particular
land
the
explorer
sooner
or
later
on
the
south
side
of
oxford
street
oxford
street
acts
to
the
north
part
of
london
what
the
strand
does
to
the
south
it
is
sure
to
bring
one
up
sooner
or
later
a
man
can
hardly
get
over
either
of
them
without
knowing
it
well
soapey
having
got
into
oxford
street
would
make
his
way
at
a
squarey
sort
of
pace
regulated
by
the
bonnets
the
vehicles
and
the
equestrians
he
met
to
criticize
for
of
women
vehicles
and
horses
he
had
voted
himself
a
consummate
judge
indeed
he
had
fully
established
in
his
own
mind
that
kiddey
downey
and
he
were
the
only
men
in
london
who
knew
anything
about
horses
and
fully
impressed
with
that
conviction
he
would
halt
and
stand
and
stare
in
a
way
that
with
any
other
man
would
have
been
considered
impertinent
perhaps
it
was
impertinent
in
soapey
we
do
mean
to
say
it
was
but
he
had
done
it
so
long
and
was
of
so
sporting
a
gait
and
cut
that
he
felt
himself
somewhat
privileged
moreover
the
majority
of
horsemen
are
so
satisfied
with
the
animals
they
bestride
that
they
cock
up
their
jibs
and
ride
along
with
a
any
fault
with
either
me
or
my
horse
if
you
can
sort
of
air
thus
sponge
proceeded
leisurely
along
now
nodding
to
this
man
now
jerking
his
elbow
to
that
now
smiling
on
a
phaeton
now
sneering
at
a
if
he
did
not
look
in
at
shackell
or
bartley
or
any
of
the
dealers
on
the
line
he
was
always
to
be
found
about
five
at
cumberland
gate
from
whence
he
would
strike
leisurely
down
the
park
and
after
coming
to
a
long
check
at
rotten
row
rails
from
whence
he
would
pass
all
the
cavalry
in
the
park
in
review
he
would
wend
his
way
back
to
the
bantam
much
in
the
style
he
had
come
this
was
his
summer
proceeding
sponge
had
pursued
this
enterprising
life
for
some
ten
at
least
and
supposing
him
to
have
begun
at
twenty
or
he
would
be
about
thirty
at
the
time
we
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
him
to
our
readers
a
period
of
life
at
which
men
begin
to
suspect
they
were
not
quite
so
wise
at
twenty
as
they
thought
not
that
sponge
had
any
particular
indiscretions
to
reflect
upon
for
he
was
tolerably
sharp
but
he
felt
that
he
might
have
made
better
use
of
his
time
which
may
be
shortly
described
as
having
been
spent
in
hunting
all
the
winter
and
in
talking
about
it
all
the
summer
with
this
popular
sport
he
combined
the
diversion
of
though
we
are
concerned
to
say
that
his
success
up
to
the
period
of
our
introduction
had
not
been
commensurate
with
his
deserts
let
us
however
hope
that
brighter
days
are
about
to
dawn
upon
him
having
now
introduced
our
hero
to
our
male
and
female
friends
under
his
interesting
pursuits
of
fox
and
it
becomes
us
to
say
a
few
words
as
to
his
qualifications
for
carrying
them
on
sponge
was
a
rather
man
at
a
distance
say
ten
yards
his
height
figure
and
carriage
gave
him
somewhat
of
a
commanding
appearance
but
this
was
rather
marred
by
a
jerky
twitchy
uneasy
sort
of
air
that
too
plainly
showed
he
was
not
the
natural
or
what
the
lower
orders
call
the
gentleman
not
that
sponge
was
shy
far
from
it
he
never
hesitated
about
offering
to
a
lady
after
a
three
acquaintance
or
in
asking
a
gentleman
to
take
him
a
horse
in
with
whom
he
might
chance
to
come
in
contact
in
the
and
he
did
it
all
in
such
a
cool
sort
of
way
that
people
who
would
have
stared
with
astonishment
if
anybody
else
had
hinted
at
such
a
proposal
really
seemed
to
come
into
the
humour
and
spirit
of
the
thing
and
to
look
upon
it
rather
as
a
matter
of
course
than
otherwise
then
his
dexterity
in
getting
into
people
houses
was
only
equalled
by
the
difficulty
of
getting
him
out
again
but
this
we
must
waive
for
the
present
in
favour
of
his
portraiture
in
height
sponge
was
above
the
middle
size
five
feet
eleven
or
so
with
a
well
borne
up
not
badly
shaped
closely
cropped
oval
head
a
tolerably
good
but
somewhat
receding
forehead
bright
hazel
eyes
roman
nose
with
carefully
tended
whiskers
reaching
the
corners
of
a
mouth
and
thence
descending
in
semicircles
into
a
vast
expanse
of
hair
beneath
the
chin
having
mentioned
sponge
groomy
gait
and
horsey
propensities
it
were
almost
needless
to
say
that
his
dress
was
in
the
sporting
style
you
saw
what
he
was
by
his
clothes
every
article
seemed
to
be
made
to
defy
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
elements
his
hat
lincoln
and
bennett
was
hard
and
heavy
it
sounded
upon
an
table
like
a
drum
a
little
magical
loop
in
the
lining
explained
the
cause
of
its
weight
somehow
his
hats
were
never
either
old
or
new
not
that
he
bought
them
but
when
he
got
a
new
one
he
took
its
off
as
he
called
it
with
a
singeing
lamp
and
made
it
look
as
if
it
had
undergone
a
few
probationary
showers
when
a
good
london
hat
recedes
to
a
certain
point
it
gets
no
worse
it
is
not
like
a
thing
that
keeps
going
and
going
until
it
declines
into
a
thing
with
no
sort
of
resemblance
to
its
original
self
barring
its
weight
and
hardness
the
sponge
hat
had
no
particular
character
apart
from
the
sponge
head
it
was
not
one
of
those
punty
ovals
or
flats
or
things
that
enables
one
to
say
who
is
in
a
house
and
who
is
not
by
a
glance
at
the
hats
in
the
entrance
but
it
was
just
a
quiet
round
hat
without
anything
remarkable
either
in
the
binding
the
lining
or
the
band
but
still
it
was
a
very
becoming
hat
when
sponge
had
it
on
there
is
a
great
deal
of
character
in
hats
we
have
seen
hats
that
bring
the
owners
to
the
recollection
far
more
forcibly
than
the
generality
of
portraits
but
to
our
hero
that
there
may
be
a
dandified
simplicity
in
dress
is
exemplified
every
day
by
our
friends
the
quakers
who
adorn
their
beautiful
brown
saxony
coats
with
little
inside
velvet
collars
and
fancy
silk
buttons
and
even
the
severe
order
of
sporting
costume
adopted
by
our
friend
sponge
is
not
devoid
of
capability
in
the
way
of
tasteful
adaptation
this
sponge
chiefly
showed
in
promoting
a
resemblance
between
his
and
waistcoats
thus
if
he
wore
a
cravat
he
would
have
a
waistcoat
if
a
striped
waistcoat
then
the
starcher
would
be
imbued
with
somewhat
of
the
same
colour
and
pattern
the
ties
of
these
varied
with
their
texture
the
silk
ones
terminated
in
a
sort
of
coaching
fold
and
were
secured
by
a
golden
pin
while
the
striped
starchers
with
the
aid
of
a
pin
on
each
side
just
made
a
neat
unpretending
tie
in
the
middle
a
sort
of
miniature
of
the
flagrant
flyaway
ones
of
aspiring
youth
of
the
present
day
his
coats
were
of
the
order
with
pockets
outside
and
generally
either
oxford
mixture
or
some
dark
colour
that
required
you
to
place
him
in
a
favourable
light
to
say
what
it
was
his
waistcoats
of
course
were
of
the
most
correct
form
and
material
generally
either
pale
buff
or
buff
with
a
narrow
stripe
similar
to
the
undress
vests
of
the
servants
of
the
royal
family
only
with
the
pattern
run
across
instead
of
lengthways
as
those
worthies
mostly
have
theirs
and
made
with
good
honest
step
collars
instead
of
the
roll
collars
they
sometimes
convert
their
upright
ones
into
when
in
deep
thought
calculating
perhaps
the
value
of
a
passing
horse
or
considering
whether
he
should
have
beefsteaks
or
lamb
chops
for
dinner
sponge
thumbs
would
rest
in
the
of
his
waistcoat
in
which
easy
but
not
very
elegant
attitude
he
would
sometimes
stand
until
all
trace
of
the
idea
that
elevated
them
had
passed
away
from
his
mind
in
the
trouser
line
he
adhered
to
the
costume
of
former
days
and
many
were
the
trials
the
easings
and
the
alterings
ere
he
got
a
pair
exactly
to
his
mind
many
were
the
customers
who
turned
away
on
seeing
his
manly
figure
filling
the
swing
mirror
in
and
sneiders
a
monopoly
that
some
tradesmen
might
object
to
only
sponge
trousers
being
admitted
to
be
perfect
of
the
art
the
more
such
a
walking
advertisement
was
seen
in
the
shop
the
better
indeed
we
believe
it
would
have
been
worth
snip
and
while
to
have
let
him
have
them
for
nothing
they
were
easy
without
being
tight
or
rather
they
looked
tight
without
being
so
there
was
a
bag
a
wrinkle
or
a
crease
that
there
be
and
strong
and
as
they
seemed
they
were
yet
as
soft
and
as
supple
as
a
lady
glove
they
looked
more
as
if
his
legs
had
been
blown
in
them
than
as
if
such
irreproachable
garments
were
the
work
of
hands
many
were
the
nudges
and
many
the
at
this
chap
trousers
that
were
given
by
ambitious
men
emulous
of
his
appearance
as
he
passed
along
and
many
were
the
turnings
round
to
examine
their
faultless
fall
upon
his
radiant
boot
the
boots
perhaps
might
come
in
for
a
little
of
the
glory
for
they
were
beautifully
soft
and
to
the
foot
easy
without
being
loose
and
he
preserved
the
lustre
of
their
polish
even
up
to
the
last
moment
of
his
walk
there
never
was
a
better
man
for
getting
through
dirt
either
on
foot
or
horseback
than
our
friend
to
the
frequenters
of
the
it
were
almost
superfluous
to
mention
that
he
is
a
constant
attendant
he
has
several
volumes
of
with
the
prices
the
horses
have
brought
set
down
in
the
margins
and
has
a
rare
knack
at
recognizing
old
friends
altered
disguised
or
disfigured
as
they
may
be
seen
that
rip
before
he
will
say
with
a
knowing
shake
of
the
head
as
some
devil
goes
best
leg
foremost
up
to
the
hammer
or
is
that
old
beast
back
why
he
here
every
day
no
man
can
impose
upon
soapy
with
a
horse
he
can
detect
the
plausibilities
of
the
equally
with
the
metamorphosis
of
the
clipper
or
singer
his
practised
eye
is
not
to
be
imposed
upon
either
by
the
blandishments
of
the
or
the
bereavements
of
the
dock
tattersall
will
hail
him
from
his
rostrum
with
a
horse
will
suit
you
sponge
cheap
good
and
handsome
come
and
buy
him
but
it
is
needless
describing
him
here
for
every
groom
and
man
knows
him
by
sight
chapter
ii
benjamin
buckram
having
dressed
and
sufficiently
described
our
hero
to
enable
our
readers
to
form
a
general
idea
of
the
man
we
have
now
to
request
them
to
return
to
the
day
of
our
introduction
sponge
had
gone
along
oxford
street
at
a
somewhat
improved
pace
to
his
usual
wont
had
paused
for
a
shorter
period
in
the
perplexed
and
pulled
up
seldomer
than
usual
between
the
circus
and
the
limits
of
his
stroll
behold
him
now
at
the
edgeware
road
end
eyeing
the
with
a
like
air
instead
of
the
contemptuous
sneer
he
generally
adopts
towards
those
uncouth
productions
red
green
blue
drab
passed
and
crossed
and
jostled
and
stopped
and
blocked
and
the
cads
telegraphed
and
winked
and
nodded
and
smiled
and
slanged
but
sponge
regarded
them
not
he
had
a
sort
of
panorama
in
his
head
knew
the
run
of
them
all
whence
they
started
where
they
stopped
where
they
watered
where
they
changed
and
wonderful
to
relate
had
never
been
entrapped
into
a
sixpenny
fare
when
he
meant
to
take
a
threepenny
one
in
cab
and
geography
there
is
not
a
more
learned
man
in
london
mark
him
as
he
stands
at
the
corner
he
sees
what
he
wants
it
the
chequered
one
with
the
red
and
blue
wheels
that
the
bayswater
ones
have
got
between
them
and
that
the
john
wood
and
two
western
railway
ones
are
trying
to
get
into
trouble
by
crossing
what
a
row
how
the
ruffians
whip
and
stamp
and
storm
and
all
but
pick
each
other
horses
teeth
with
their
poles
how
the
cads
gesticulate
and
the
passengers
imprecate
now
the
bonnets
are
out
of
the
windows
and
the
row
increases
six
coachmen
cutting
and
storming
six
cads
sawing
the
air
sixteen
ladies
in
flowers
screaming
sturdy
passengers
swearing
they
will
them
all
and
sponge
is
the
only
cool
person
in
the
scene
he
does
rush
into
the
throng
and
in
for
fear
the
should
extricate
itself
and
drive
on
without
him
he
does
make
confusion
worse
confounded
by
intimating
his
behest
he
does
soil
his
bright
boots
by
stepping
off
the
but
quietly
waiting
the
evaporation
of
the
steam
and
the
disentanglement
of
the
vehicles
by
the
smallest
possible
sign
in
the
world
given
at
the
opportune
moment
and
a
steady
adhesion
to
the
flags
the
is
obliged
either
to
to
or
lose
the
fare
and
he
steps
quietly
in
and
squeezes
along
to
the
far
end
as
though
intent
on
going
the
whole
hog
of
the
journey
away
they
rumble
up
the
edgeware
road
the
gradual
emergence
from
the
brick
and
mortar
of
london
being
marked
as
well
by
the
telling
out
of
passengers
as
by
the
increasing
distances
between
the
houses
first
it
is
all
close
huddle
with
both
austere
iron
railings
guard
the
subterranean
kitchen
areas
and
austere
looks
indicate
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
passengers
to
guard
their
own
pockets
gradually
little
gardens
usurp
the
places
of
the
cramped
areas
and
with
their
humanizing
appearance
softer
looks
assume
the
place
of
frowning
ones
presently
a
glimpse
of
green
country
or
of
distant
hills
may
be
caught
between
the
wider
spaces
of
the
houses
and
frequent
settings
down
increase
the
space
between
the
passengers
gradually
conservatories
appear
and
conversation
strikes
up
then
come
the
exclusiveness
of
villas
some
detached
and
others
running
out
at
last
into
real
pure
green
fields
studded
with
trees
and
picturesque
before
one
of
which
latter
a
sudden
wheel
round
and
a
jerk
announces
the
journey
done
the
last
passenger
if
there
is
one
is
then
unceremoniously
turned
loose
upon
the
country
our
readers
will
have
the
kindness
to
suppose
our
hero
sponge
shot
out
of
an
omnibus
at
the
sign
of
the
cat
and
compasses
in
the
full
rurality
of
grass
country
sprinkled
with
fallows
and
we
should
state
that
this
unwonted
journey
was
a
desire
to
pay
a
visit
to
benjamin
buckram
the
farm
at
scampley
distant
some
mile
and
a
half
from
where
he
was
set
down
a
space
that
he
now
purposed
travelling
on
foot
benjamin
buckram
was
a
small
small
at
least
when
he
was
buying
though
great
when
he
was
selling
it
would
do
a
youngster
good
to
see
ben
filling
the
two
capacities
he
dealt
in
second
hand
that
is
to
say
past
mark
of
mouth
horses
but
on
the
present
occasion
sponge
sought
his
services
in
the
capacity
of
a
letter
rather
than
a
seller
of
horses
sponge
wanted
to
job
a
couple
of
horses
with
the
option
of
buying
them
provided
he
sponge
could
sell
them
for
more
than
he
would
have
to
give
buckram
exclusive
of
the
hire
buckram
job
price
we
should
say
was
as
near
twelve
pounds
a
month
containing
days
as
he
could
screw
the
hirer
of
course
keeping
the
animals
scampley
is
one
of
those
pretty
little
suburban
farms
peculiar
to
the
north
and
side
of
london
farms
varying
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
acres
of
gravelly
soil
each
farm
with
its
picturesque
little
buildings
consisting
of
small
brick
houses
with
small
flat
roofs
and
and
hard
by
a
large
three
times
the
size
of
the
house
or
a
desolate
barn
half
as
big
as
all
the
rest
of
the
buildings
from
the
smallness
of
the
holdings
the
farmhouses
are
dotted
about
as
thickly
and
at
such
varying
distances
from
the
roads
as
to
look
like
inferior
falling
out
of
rank
most
of
them
have
a
sort
of
look
the
rustics
who
cultivate
them
or
rather
look
after
them
are
neither
exactly
town
nor
country
they
have
the
clownish
dress
and
boorish
gait
of
the
regular
with
a
good
deal
of
the
quick
suspicious
sour
sauciness
of
the
low
london
resident
if
you
can
get
an
answer
from
them
at
all
it
is
generally
delivered
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
that
the
answerer
thinks
you
are
what
they
call
them
asking
them
what
you
know
these
farms
serve
the
double
purpose
of
purveyors
to
the
london
stables
and
hospitals
for
sick
overworked
or
unsaleable
horses
all
the
great
and
have
these
retreats
in
the
country
and
the
smaller
ones
pretend
to
have
from
whence
in
due
course
they
can
draw
any
sort
of
an
animal
a
customer
may
want
just
as
little
cellarless
can
get
you
any
sort
of
wine
from
real
establishments
if
you
only
give
them
time
there
was
a
good
deal
of
mystery
about
scampley
it
was
sometimes
in
the
hands
of
benjamin
buckram
sometimes
in
the
hands
of
his
assignees
sometimes
in
those
of
his
cousin
abraham
brown
and
sometimes
john
doe
and
richard
roe
were
the
occupants
of
it
benjamin
buckram
though
very
far
from
being
one
had
the
advantage
of
looking
like
a
respectable
man
there
was
a
certain
plump
rosiness
about
him
which
aided
by
a
dress
joined
to
a
continual
fumble
in
the
pockets
of
his
drab
trousers
gave
him
the
air
of
a
sort
of
man
moreover
he
sported
a
velvet
collar
to
his
blue
coat
a
more
imposing
ornament
than
it
appears
at
first
sight
to
be
sure
there
are
two
sorts
of
velvet
collars
the
legitimate
velvet
collar
commencing
with
the
coat
and
the
adopted
velvet
collar
put
on
when
the
cloth
one
gets
shabby
buckram
was
always
the
legitimate
velvet
collar
new
from
the
first
and
we
really
believe
a
permanent
velvet
collar
adhered
to
in
storm
and
in
sunshine
has
a
very
impression
on
the
world
it
shows
a
spirit
superior
to
feelings
of
paltry
economy
and
we
think
a
person
would
be
much
more
excusable
for
being
victimized
by
a
man
with
a
good
velvet
collar
to
his
coat
than
by
one
exhibiting
that
spurious
sign
of
gentility
a
horse
and
gig
the
reader
will
now
have
the
kindness
to
consider
sponge
arriving
at
scampley
mr
sponge
exclaimed
buckram
who
having
seen
our
friend
advancing
up
the
little
twisting
approach
from
the
road
to
his
house
through
a
little
square
window
almost
blinded
with
irish
ivy
out
of
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
contemplating
the
arrival
of
his
occasional
lodgers
doe
and
roe
mr
sponge
exclaimed
he
with
gaiety
should
have
been
here
yesterday
sent
away
two
sich
osses
perfect
the
werry
best
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
either
would
have
bin
the
werry
oss
for
your
money
but
come
in
sponge
sir
come
in
continued
he
backing
himself
through
a
little
of
a
green
portico
to
a
narrow
passage
which
branched
off
into
little
rooms
on
either
side
as
buckram
made
this
retrograde
movement
he
gave
a
gentle
pull
to
the
wooden
handle
of
an
wire
in
the
midst
of
buggy
and
other
whips
hanging
in
the
entrance
a
touch
that
was
acknowledged
by
a
single
tinkle
of
the
bell
in
the
they
then
entered
the
little
room
on
the
right
whose
walls
were
decorated
with
various
sporting
prints
chiefly
illustrative
of
with
here
and
there
a
stunted
tossing
about
as
a
duster
the
room
reeked
with
the
effluvia
of
stale
smoke
and
the
faded
green
baize
of
a
little
round
table
in
the
centre
was
covered
with
and
empty
the
whole
furniture
of
the
room
was
worth
five
pounds
sponge
being
now
on
the
dealing
tack
commenced
in
the
strain
adapted
to
the
occasion
having
deposited
his
hat
on
the
floor
taken
his
left
leg
up
to
nurse
and
given
his
hair
a
backward
rub
with
his
right
hand
he
thus
commenced
buckram
said
he
tell
you
how
it
is
i
deuced
regularly
in
short
gardens
i
lost
eighteen
on
the
derby
and
seven
on
the
leger
the
best
part
of
my
year
income
indeed
and
i
just
want
to
hire
two
or
three
horses
for
the
season
with
the
option
of
buying
if
i
like
and
if
you
supply
me
well
i
may
be
the
means
of
bringing
grist
to
your
mill
you
twig
eh
sponge
replied
buckram
sliding
several
consecutive
down
the
incline
plane
of
his
pocket
sponge
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
my
best
for
you
i
wish
you
come
yesterday
though
as
i
said
before
i
jest
had
two
of
the
neatest
nags
a
bay
and
a
grey
not
that
colour
makes
any
matter
to
a
judge
like
you
there
no
sounder
than
that
a
good
oss
is
not
never
of
a
bad
colour
only
to
a
young
gemman
you
know
it
well
to
have
smart
and
the
ticket
in
short
howsomever
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
and
if
there
nothin
in
that
tickles
your
fancy
why
you
must
give
me
a
few
days
to
see
if
i
can
arrange
an
exchange
with
some
other
gent
but
the
present
is
like
to
be
a
werry
haggiwatin
season
had
more
happlications
for
osses
nor
ever
i
remembers
and
i
been
a
dealer
now
man
and
boy
turned
of
years
but
young
gents
is
whimsical
and
it
was
a
young
wot
got
these
and
there
no
sayin
but
he
may
like
them
indeed
one
rayther
difficult
to
ride
that
to
say
the
grey
the
neatest
of
the
two
and
he
come
back
and
if
so
you
shall
have
him
and
a
safer
sweeter
oss
was
never
seen
or
one
more
like
to
do
credit
to
a
gent
but
you
knows
what
an
oss
is
sponge
and
can
do
justice
to
me
and
i
should
like
to
put
summut
good
into
your
hands
i
should
with
conversation
or
rather
with
balderdash
such
as
this
buckram
beguiled
the
few
minutes
necessary
for
removing
the
bandages
hiding
the
bottles
and
stirring
up
the
cripples
about
to
be
examined
and
the
heavy
flap
of
the
door
announcing
that
all
was
ready
he
forthwith
led
the
way
through
a
door
in
a
brick
wall
into
a
little
of
a
square
yard
formed
of
stables
and
loose
boxes
with
a
dilapidated
above
a
pump
in
the
centre

peter
leather
nothing
bespeaks
the
character
of
a
dealer
trade
more
than
the
servants
and
of
the
establishment
the
civiler
in
manner
and
the
better
they
are
on
the
higher
the
standing
of
the
master
and
the
better
the
stamp
of
the
horses
those
about
buckram
were
of
a
very
shady
order
sloggering
fellows
with
the
word
indelibly
imprinted
on
their
faces
peter
leather
the
head
man
was
one
of
the
fallen
angels
of
servitude
he
had
once
driven
a
duke
the
duke
of
dazzleton
having
nothing
whatever
to
do
but
dress
himself
and
climb
into
his
richly
fringed
throne
with
a
helper
at
each
horse
head
to
go
at
a
nod
from
his
broad
laced
hat
then
having
got
in
his
cargo
or
rubbish
as
he
used
to
call
them
he
would
start
off
at
a
pace
that
was
truly
terrific
cutting
out
this
vehicle
shooting
past
that
all
but
grazing
a
third
anathematizing
the
and
abusing
the
draymen
we
do
know
how
he
might
be
with
the
queen
but
he
certainly
drove
as
though
he
thought
nobody
had
any
business
in
the
street
while
the
duchess
of
dazzleton
wanted
it
the
duchess
liked
going
fast
and
peter
accommodated
her
the
duke
jobbed
his
horses
and
did
care
about
pace
and
so
things
might
have
gone
on
very
comfortably
if
peter
one
afternoon
had
run
his
pole
into
the
panel
of
a
very
plain
but
very
neat
yellow
barouche
passing
the
end
of
new
bond
street
which
having
nothing
but
a
simple
crest
a
stag
head
on
the
panel
made
him
think
it
belonged
to
some
bulky
cit
taking
the
air
with
his
rib
but
who
unfortunately
turned
out
to
be
no
less
a
person
than
sir
giles
nabem
knight
the
great
police
magistrate
upon
one
of
whose
myrmidons
in
plain
clothes
who
came
to
the
rescue
peter
committed
a
most
violent
assault
for
which
unlucky
casualty
his
worship
furnished
him
with
rotatory
occupation
for
his
fat
calves
in
the
of
as
the
clerk
shortly
designated
the
house
of
correction
thither
peter
went
and
in
lieu
of
his
coat
plushes
stockings
and
buckled
shoes
he
was
dressed
up
in
a
suit
of
yellow
and
worsteds
that
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
wasp
without
wings
peter
leather
then
tumbled
regularly
down
the
staircase
of
servitude
the
greatness
of
his
fall
being
occasionally
broken
by
landing
in
some
inferior
place
from
the
duke
of
dazzleton
or
rather
from
the
he
went
to
the
marquis
of
mammon
whom
he
very
soon
left
because
he
would
wear
a
wig
from
the
marquis
he
got
hired
to
the
great
irish
earl
of
coarsegab
who
expected
him
to
wash
the
carriage
wait
at
table
and
do
other
incidentals
never
contemplated
by
a
london
coachman
peter
threw
this
place
up
with
indignation
on
being
told
to
take
the
letters
to
the
post
he
then
lived
on
his
for
a
while
a
thing
that
is
much
finer
in
theory
than
in
practice
and
having
about
exhausted
his
substance
and
placed
the
bulk
of
his
apparel
in
safe
keeping
he
condescended
to
take
a
place
as
job
coachman
in
a
a
let
by
the
hour
day
or
one
in
which
he
enacted
as
many
characters
at
least
made
as
many
different
appearances
as
the
late
mathews
used
to
do
in
his
celebrated
homes
one
day
peter
would
be
seen
ducking
under
the
mews
entrance
in
one
of
those
greasy
painfully
hats
the
certain
precursors
of
soiled
linen
and
seedy
most
buttoned
coats
that
would
puzzle
a
conjuror
to
say
whether
they
were
black
or
grey
or
olive
or
invisible
green
turned
visible
brown
then
another
day
he
might
be
seen
in
old
gadabout
livery
with
a
tarnished
hat
nodding
over
his
nose
and
on
a
third
he
would
shine
forth
in
flareup
cockaded
one
with
a
worsted
and
a
much
light
drab
livery
coat
with
crimson
inexpressibles
so
tight
as
to
astonish
a
beholder
how
he
ever
got
into
them
humiliation
however
has
its
limits
as
well
as
other
things
and
peter
having
been
invited
to
descend
from
his
box
alas
a
regular
country
patent
leather
one
and
invest
himself
in
a
blue
coat
with
a
red
vest
and
a
pair
of
blue
trousers
with
a
broad
red
stripe
down
the
sides
to
drive
the
honourable
old
miss
wrinkleton
of
harley
street
to
court
in
a
oss
as
he
called
a
clarence
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
chucking
the
nether
garments
into
the
fire
he
rushed
frantically
up
the
mounted
his
box
and
quilted
the
old
crocodile
of
a
horse
all
the
way

so
that
by
the
time
he
got
home
he
had
established
a
considerable
lather
on
the
old
nag
which
his
master
resenting
a
row
ensued
the
sequel
of
which
may
readily
be
imagined
after
assisting

peter

having
a

well
as

had
given
himself
an

of
one
of

noble
employers
in
hopes
that
sponge

might
lead
to

peter
was
about
sick
of

that

in

of
military

the

had
a
good
understanding

fallen
into

tacit

at
liberty
to
make

again
letting

a
reaccumulated
rush
of
silver
down
his

giving
the
little
tinkler
of
a
bell

as
he
spoke

in

leather
passing
through
a
stable
into
a
wooden
projection
beyond
where
the
gentleman
in
question
was
enjoying
a
nap
said
he
repeated
he
in
a
louder
tone
as
he
saw
the
object
of
his
search
nose
popping
through
the
midst
of
the
straw
now
exclaimed
sam
starting
up
and
looking
wildly
around
now
repeated
he
rubbing
his
eyes
with
the
backs
of
his
hands
out
ercles
said
leather
the
lad
was
a
mere
stripling
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
perhaps
tall
slight
and
neat
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
was
dressed
in
a
brown
jacket
a
real
boy
jacket
without
laps
white
cords
and
it
was
his
business
to
risk
his
neck
and
limbs
at
all
hours
of
the
day
on
all
sorts
of
horses
over
any
sort
of
place
that
any
person
chose
to
require
him
to
put
a
horse
at
and
this
he
did
with
the
daring
pleasure
of
youth
as
yet
undaunted
by
any
serious
fall
sam
now
bestirred
himself
to
get
out
the
horse
the
clambering
of
hoofs
presently
announced
his
approach
whether
hercules
was
called
hercules
on
account
of
his
amazing
strength
or
from
a
fanciful
relationship
to
the
famous
horse
of
that
name
we
know
not
but
his
strength
and
his
colour
would
favour
either
supposition
he
was
an
immense
tall
powerful
dark
brown
sixteen
hands
horse
with
an
arched
neck
and
crest
well
set
on
clean
lean
head
and
loins
that
looked
as
if
they
could
shoot
a
man
into
the
next
county
his
condition
was
perfect
his
coat
lay
as
close
and
even
as
satin
with
cleanly
developed
muscle
and
altogether
he
looked
as
hard
as
a
he
had
a
famous
switch
tail
reaching
nearly
to
his
hocks
and
making
him
look
less
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
sponge
was
too
well
versed
in
to
imagine
that
such
an
animal
would
be
in
the
possession
of
such
a
dealer
as
buckram
unless
there
was
something
radically
wrong
about
him
and
as
sam
and
leather
were
paying
the
horse
those
stable
attentions
that
always
precede
a
show
out
sponge
settled
in
his
own
mind
that
the
observation
about
his
requiring
a
horseman
to
ride
him
meant
that
he
was
vicious
nor
was
he
wrong
in
his
anticipations
for
not
all
leather
whistlings
or
endearings
and
watchings
could
conceal
the
sunken
scowling
eye
that
as
good
as
said
better
keep
clear
of
me
sponge
however
was
a
dauntless
horseman
what
man
dared
he
dared
and
as
the
horse
stepped
proudly
and
freely
out
of
the
stable
sponge
thought
he
looked
very
like
a
hunter
nor
were
buckram
laudations
wanting
in
the
animal
behalf
an
exclaimed
he
drawing
his
right
hand
out
of
his
trouser
pocket
and
flourishing
it
towards
him
that
were
down
in
leicestersheer
added

three
guineas
sir
richard
would
him
in
a
minnit
he
would
added
he
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
as
he
saw
the
animal
beginning
to
set
up
his
back
and
wince
at
the
approach
of
the
lad
we
may
here
mention
by
way
of
parenthesis
that
buckram
had
brought
him
out
of
warwicksheer
for
thirty
pounds
where
the
horse
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
as
well
by
kicking
off
sundry
scarlet
swells
in
the
gaily
thronged
streets
of
leamington
as
by
running
away
with
divers
others
over
the
grazing
grounds
of
southam
and
dunchurch
but
to
our
story
the
horse
now
stood
staring
on
view
fire
in
his
eye
and
vigour
in
his
every
limb
leather
at
his
head
the
lad

his
side

by
a
little
wince
and
hoist
of
the
hind
quarters
on
the
nearer
approach
of
the

sharp
boy
said
he
in
a
very
different
tone
to
the
soothing
one
in
which
he
had
just
been
addressing
the
horse
the
lad
lifted
up
his
leg
for
a
hoist
leather
gave
him
one
as
quick
as
thought
and
led
on
the
horse
as
the
lad
gathered
up
his
reins
they
then
made
for
a
large
field
at
the
back
of
the
house
with
hurdles
and
offs
and
outs
all
sorts
of
fancy
leaps
scattered
about
having
got
him
fairly
in
and
the
lad
having
got
himself
fairly
settled
in
the
saddle
he
gave
the
horse
a
touch
with
the
spur
as
leather
let
go
his
head
and
after
a
desperate
plunge
or
two
started
off
at
a
gallop

confidentially
to
sponge

short
of

put
every

would
put

timid
cocknified

on

he
were

i
does
know

that
we
might
get

but
the
playful

he
got
a
workman
on
his
back

how
he
gives
to
the
lad
though
he
only
fifteen
and
not
strong
of
his
hage
nouther
continued
buckram
i
guess
if
he
had
sich
a
consternation
of
talent
as
you
on
his
back
he
wery
soon
be
as
quiet
as
a

not
that
he
wicious
far
from
it
only
play
full
of
play
i
may
say
though
to
be
sure
if
a
man
gets
spilt
it
do
argufy
much
whether
it
done
from
play
or
from
wice
during
this
time
the
horse
was
going
through
his
evolutions
hopping
over
this
thing
popping
over
that
making
as
little
of
everything
as
practice
makes
them
do
having
gone
through
the
usual
routine
the
lad
now
walked
the
glowing
coated
snorting
horse
back
to
where
the
trio
stood
sponge
again
looked
him
over
and
still
seeing
no
exception
to
take
to
him
bid
the
lad
get
off
and
lengthen
the
stirrups
for
him
to
take
a
ride
that
was
the
difficulty
the
first
two
minutes
always
did
it
sponge
however
nothing
daunted
borrowed
sam
spurs
and
making
leather
hold
the
horse
by
the
head
till
he
got
well
into
the
saddle
and
then
lead
him
on
a
bit
he
gave
the
animal
such
a
dig
in
both
sides
as
fairly
threw
him
off
his
guard
and
made
him
start
away
at
a
gallop
instead
of
standing
and
delivering
as
was
his
wont
away
sponge
shot
pulling
him
about
trying
all
his
paces
and
putting
him
at
all
sorts
of
leaps
emboldened
by
the
nerve
and
dexterity
displayed
by
sponge
buckram
stood
meditating
a
further
trial
of
his
equestrian
ability
as
he
watched
him
bucketing
about
hercules
had
so
many
triers
and
the
hideous
contraction
of
his
resolute
back
had
deterred
so
many
from
mounting
that
buckram
had
begun
to
fear
he
would
have
to
place
him
in
the
only
remaining
school
for
incurables
the
riders
are
seldom
great
horsemen
the
very
fact
of
their
being
riders
shows
they
are
little
accustomed
to
horses
or
they
would
not
give
the
of
an
animal
for
a
few
weeks
work
a
wonderful
clever
little
oss
observed
buckram
as
sponge
returned
with
a
and
a
satisfied
air
on
the
late
resolute
animal
back
i
can
call
continued
buckram
he
low
but
you
knows
that
the
of
an
oss
has
nothin
to
do
with
his
size
now
this
is
a
perfect
in
miniature
an
gent
lookin
at
him
day
christen
him
multum
in
parvo
but
though
he
so
strong
he
has
the
knack
o
goin
specially
in
deep
and
if
you
not
to
sir
richard
but
into
some
o
them
plough
sheers
shires
i
him
to
you
have
a
look
at
him
replied
sponge
throwing
his
right
leg
over
hercules
head
and
sliding
from
the
saddle
on
to
the
ground
as
if
he
were
alighting
from
the
quietest
shooting
pony
in
the
world
all
then
was
hurry
scurry
and
scamper
to
get
this
second
prodigy
out
presently
he
appeared
multum
in
parvo
certainly
was
all
that
buckram
described
him
a
long
low
chestnut
with
a
long
tail
and
great
large
flat
white
legs
without
mark
or
blemish
upon
them
unlike
hercules
there
was
nothing
indicative
of
vice
or
mischief
about
him
indeed
he
was
rather
a
sedate
animal
and
instead
of
the
watchful
sort
of
way
leather
and
treated
hercules
they
jerked
and
punched
parvo
about
as
if
he
were
a
cow
still
parvo
had
his
foibles
he
was
a
resolute
animal
that
would
go
his
own
way
in
spite
of
all
the
pulling
and
hauling
in
the
world
if
he
took
it
into
his
obstinate
head
to
turn
into
a
particular
field
into
it
he
would
be
or
against
the
he
would
bump
the
rider
leg
in
a
way
that
would
make
him
remember
the
difference
of
opinion
between
them
his
was
not
a
fiery
spirit
with
object
or
reason
for
its
guide
but
just
a
regular
downright
sort
of
stupidity
that
nobody
could
account
for
he
had
a
mouth
like
a
bull
and
would
walk
clean
through
a
gate
sometimes
rather
than
be
at
the
trouble
of
rising
to
leap
it
at
other
times
he
would
hop
over
it
like
a
bird
he
could
not
beat
buckram
men
because
they
were
always
on
the
for
objects
of
contention
with
sharp
spur
rowels
ready
to
let
into
his
sides
the
moment
he
began
to
stop
but
a
weak
or
a
timid
man
on
his
back
had
no
more
chance
than
he
would
on
an
elephant
if
the
horse
chose
to
carry
him
into
the
midst
of
the
hounds
at
the
meet
he
would
have
him
in
nay
he
would
think
nothing
of
upsetting
the
master
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
then
the
provoking
part
was
that
the
obstinate
animal
after
having
done
all
the
mischief
would
just
set
to
to
eat
as
if
nothing
had
happened
after
rolling
a
sportsman
in
the
mud
he
would
repair
to
the
nearest
or
grassy
bank
and
be
caught
he
was
now
ten
years
old
or
a
more
perhaps
and
very
wicked
years
some
of
them
had
been
his
adventures
his
sellings
and
his
returning
his
lettings
and
his
unlettings
his
bumpings
and
spillings
his
smashings
and
crashings
on
the
road
in
the
field
in
single
and
in
double
harness
would
furnish
a
volume
of
themselves
and
in
default
of
a
more
able
historian
we
purpose
blending
his
future
fortune
with
that
of
in
the
service
of
our
hero
sponge
and
his
accomplished
groom
and
undertaking
the
important
narration
of
them
ourselves
illustration
chapter
iv
laverick
wells
we
trust
our
opening
chapters
aided
by
our
friend
leech
pencil
will
have
enabled
our
readers
to
embody
such
a
sponge
in
their
mind
eye
as
will
assist
them
in
following
us
through
the
course
of
his
peregrinations
we
do
not
profess
to
have
drawn
such
a
portrait
as
will
raise
the
same
sort
of
sponge
in
the
minds
of
all
but
we
trust
we
have
given
such
a
general
outline
of
style
and
indication
of
character
as
an
ordinary
knowledge
of
the
world
will
enable
them
to
imagine
a
good
pushing
sort
of
man
wishing
to
be
a
gentleman
without
knowing
how
far
more
difficult
is
the
task
of
conveying
to
our
readers
such
information
as
will
enable
them
to
form
an
idea
of
our
hero
ways
and
means
an
accommodating
world
especially
the
female
portion
of
it
generally
attribute
ruin
to
the
racer
and
fortune
to
the
but
though
sponge
large
losses
on
the
turf
as
detailed
by
him
to
buckram
on
the
occasion
of
their
deal
or
would
bring
him
in
the
category
of
the
unfortunates
still
that
representation
was
nearly
if
not
altogether
fabulous
that
sponge
might
have
lost
a
trifle
on
the
great
races
of
the
year
we
do
mean
to
deny
but
that
he
lost
such
a
sum
as
eighteen
hundred
on
the
derby
and
seven
on
the
leger
we
are
in
a
condition
to
contradict
for
the
best
of
all
possible
reasons
that
he
had
it
to
lose
at
the
same
time
we
do
not
mean
to
attribute
falsehood
to
sponge
quite
the
contrary
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
merchants
and
traders
men
who
in
thousands
to
declare
that
they
lost
twenty
thousand
by
this
or
forty
thousand
by
that
simply
meaning
that
they
did
make
it
and
if
sponge
by
taking
the
longest
of
the
long
odds
against
the
most
wretched
of
the
outsiders
might
have
won
the
sums
he
named
he
surely
had
a
right
to
say
he
lost
them
when
he
did
get
them
it
never
does
to
be
indigenously
poor
if
we
may
use
such
a
term
and
when
a
man
gets
to
the
end
of
his
tether
he
must
have
something
or
somebody
to
blame
rather
than
his
own
extravagance
or
imprudence
and
if
there
is
no
lawyer
who
has
bolted
with
his
or
fraudulent
agent
who
has
misappropriated
his
funds
why
then
railroads
or
losses
on
the
turf
or
banks
that
have
shut
up
at
short
notice
come
in
as
the
scapegoats
very
willing
hacks
they
are
too
railways
especially
and
so
frequently
ridden
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
discriminate
between
the
real
and
the
fictitious
loser
but
though
we
are
able
to
contradict
sponge
losses
on
the
turf
we
are
sorry
we
are
not
able
to
elevate
him
to
the
riches
the
character
of
a
generally
inspires
still
like
many
men
of
whom
the
common
observation
is
knows
how
he
lives
sponge
always
seemed
well
to
do
in
the
world
there
was
no
appearance
of
want
about
him
he
always
hunted
sometimes
with
five
horses
sometimes
with
four
seldom
with
less
than
three
though
at
the
period
of
our
introduction
he
had
come
down
to
two
nevertheless
those
two
provided
he
could
but
make
them
were
well
calculated
to
do
the
work
of
four
and
hack
horses
of
all
sorts
it
may
be
observed
generally
do
double
the
work
of
private
ones
and
if
there
is
one
man
in
the
world
better
calculated
to
get
the
work
out
of
them
than
another
that
man
most
assuredly
is
sponge
and
this
reminds
us
that
we
may
as
well
state
that
his
bargain
with
buckram
was
a
sort
of
jobbing
deal
he
had
to
pay
ten
guineas
a
month
for
each
horse
with
a
sort
of
sliding
scale
of
prices
if
he
chose
to
buy
the
price
of
the
big
brown
being
fixed
at
fifty
inclusive
of
hire
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
and
gradually
rising
according
to
the
length
of
time
he
kept
him
beyond
that
while
in
parvo
the
resolute
chestnut
was
booked
at
thirty
with
the
right
of
buying
at
five
more
a
contingency
that
buckram
little
expected
he
we
may
add
had
got
him
for
ten
and
dear
he
thought
him
when
he
got
him
home
the
world
was
now
all
before
sponge
where
to
choose
and
not
being
the
man
to
keep
hack
horses
to
look
at
we
must
be
setting
him
swells
as
buckram
would
call
them
with
their
fourteen
hunters
and
four
hacks
will
smile
at
the
idea
of
a
man
going
from
home
to
hunt
with
only
a
couple
of
but
sponge
knew
what
he
was
about
and
did
want
any
one
to
counsel
him
he
knew
there
were
places
where
a
man
can
follow
up
the
effect
produced
by
a
red
coat
in
the
morning
to
great
advantage
in
the
evening
and
if
he
could
hunt
every
day
in
the
week
as
he
could
have
wished
he
felt
he
might
fill
up
his
time
perhaps
quite
as
profitably
in
other
ways
the
ladies
to
do
them
justice
are
never
at
all
suspicious
about
men
on
the
always
taking
it
for
granted
they
are
they
could
wish
and
they
know
each
other
so
well
that
any
cautionary
hint
acts
rather
in
a
man
favour

a

turn

gently
rising

hitherto
uninteresting
road
brings
the
posting
traveller
suddenly
upon
the
rich
beautifully
undulating
vale
of
fordingford
whose
fine
green
pastures
are
brightened
with
occasional
gleams
of
a
meandering
river
flowing
through
the
centre
of
the
vale
in
the
far
distance
looking
as
though
close
upon
the
blue
hills
though
in
reality
several
miles
apart
sundry
spires
and
taller
buildings
are
seen
rising
above
the
grey
mists
towards
which
a
straight
undeviating
line
of
railway
passing
up
the

the
vale
directs
the
eye
this
is
the
famed
laverick

the

indeed
all
are
according
to
newspaper
accounts
of
and
dames
and
all
that
wealth
and
lofty
lineage
claim
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
however
wells
was
in
great
feather
it
had
never
known
such
times
every
house
every
lodging
every
hole
and
corner
was
full
and
the
great
hotels
which
more
resemble
lancashire
than
english

were
sending
away
applicants
in
the
most
offhand
indifferent
way
the
laverick

hounds
had
formerly
been
under
the
management
of
the
thomas
slocdolager
a
sort
of
sportsman
whose
whole
soul
was
in
the
thing
and
who
would
have
ridden
over
his
best
friend
in
the
ardour
of
the
chase
illustration
thomas
slocdolager
late
master
of
the
laverick
wells
hounds
in
some
countries
such
a
creature
may
be
considered
an
acquisition
and
so
long
as
he
reigned
at
the
wells
people
made
the
best
they
could
of
him
though
it
was
painfully
apparent
to
the
keepers
and
others
who
had
the
best
interest
of
the
place
at
heart
that
such
a
gloveless
buffer
who
would
throw
off
at
the
right
time
and
who
resolutely
set
his
great
face
against
all
show
meets
and
social
intercourse
in
the
field
was
not
exactly
the
man
for
a
civilized
place
whether
time
might
have
enlightened
slocdolager
as
to
the
fact
that
continuous
killing
of
foxes
after
fatiguingly
long
runs
was
not
the
way
to
the
hearts
of
the
laverick
wells
sportsmen
is
unknown
for
on
attempting
to
realize
as
fine
a
subscription
as
ever
appeared
upon
paper
it
melted
so
in
the
process
of
collection
that
what
was
realized
was
hardly
worth
his
acceptance
saying
so
in
his
usual
blunt
way
that
if
he
hunted
a
country
at
his
own
expense
he
would
hunt
one
that
was
encumbered
with
fools
he
just
stamped
his
little
wardrobe
into
a
pair
of
old
black
and
rode
out
of
town
without
saying
tar
carding
or
anybody
this
was
at
the
end
of
a
season
a
circumstance
that
considerably
mitigated
the
inconvenience
so
abrupt
a
departure
might
have
occasioned
and
as
one
of
the
great
beauties
of
laverick
wells
is
that
it
is
just
as
much
in
vogue
in
summer
as
in
winter
the
inhabitants
consoled
themselves
with
the
old
aphorism
that
there
is
as
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
of
it
and
cast
about
in
search
of
some
one
to
supply
his
place
at
as
small
cost
to
themselves
as
possible
in
a
place
so
replete
with
money
and
the
enterprise
of
youth
little
difficulty
was
anticipated
especially
when
the
old
bait
of

being
all
that
was
wanted
ample
subscription
to
defray
all
expenses
figuring
in
the
background
was
held
out

among
a
host
of
most
meritorious
young
men
any
of
whom
would
get
up
behind
a
bill
for
five
hundred
pounds
without
looking
to
see
that

a
thousand

a

on

considerable

charming

the

just

father
then
was
either
a
great
grazier
or
a
great
brazier

we
are
unable
to
say

small
drop
of

having
fallen

but
like

on
the
first
letter
of
the
word
in
our
correspondent

it
may
do
for
either
but
in
one
of
which
trades
he
made
a
of
money
and
latish
on
in
life
married
a
lady
who
hitherto
had
filled
the
honourable
office
of
in
his
house
she
was
a
fine
handsome
woman
and
a
year
or
two
after
the
birth
of
this
their
only
child
he
departed
this
life
nearer
eighty
than
seventy
leaving
an
who
unfortunately
contracted
matrimony
with
a
master
before
she
got
the
fine
flattering
white
monument
up
causing
young
waffles
to
be
claimed
for
by
that
expert
matron
the
high
court
of
chancery
who
of
course
had
him
properly
educated
where
it
is
immaterial
to
relate
as
we
shall
step
on
till
we
find
him
at
college
our
friend
having
proved
rather
too
vivacious
for
the
oxford
dons
had
been
recommended
to
try
the
effects
of
the
laverick
wells
or
any
other
waters
he
liked
and
had
arrived
with
a
couple
of
hunters
and
a
hack
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
neighbouring
master
of
hounds
and
his
huntsman
for
waffles
had
ridden
over
and
maimed
more
hounds
to
his
own
share
during
the
two
seasons
he
had
been
at
oxford
than
that
gentleman
had
been
in
the
habit
of
appropriating
to
the
use
of
the
whole
university
corresponding
with
that
gentleman
delight
at
getting
rid
of
him
was
dismay
at
his
appearance
for
fully
satisfied
that
oxford
was
the
seat
of
as
well
as
of
all
the
other
arts
and
sciences
waffles
undertook
to
enlighten
him
and
his
huntsman
on
the
mysteries
of
their
calling
and
sloc
as
he
was
called
being
a
very
silent
man
while
waffles
was
a
very
noisy
one
sloc
was
nearly
talked
deaf
by
him
waffles
was
just
in
the
of
hot
rash
youthful
indiscretion
and
extravagance
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
value
of
money
and
looked
at
the
fortune
he
was
so
closely
approaching
as
perfectly
inexhaustible
his
rooms
the
most
spacious
and
splendid
at
that
most
spacious
and
splendid
hotel
the
were
filled
with
a
profusion
of
the
most
useless
but
costly
articles
jewellery
without
end
pictures
innumerable
pictures
that
represented
all
sorts
of
imaginary
sums
of
money
just
as
they
represented
all
sorts
of
imaginary
scenes
but
whose
real
worth
or
genuineness
would
never
be
tested
till
the
owner
wanted
to
them
waffles
was
a
man
tall
slim
and
slight
with
long
curly
light
hair
pink
and
white
complexion
visionary
whispers
and
a
tendency
to
moustache
that
could
best
be
seen
sideways
he
had
light
blue
eyes
while
his
features
generally
were
good
but
expressive
of
little
beyond
great
in
dress
he
was
both
smart
and
various
indeed
we
feel
a
difficulty
in
fixing
him
in
any
particular
costume
so
frequent
and
opposite
were
his
changes
he
had
coats
of
every
cut
and
colour
sometimes
he
was
the
racing
man
with
a
newmarket
brown
and
trousers
with
drab
anon
he
would
be
the
officer
and
shine
forth
in
a
fancy
forage
cap
cocked
jauntily
over
a
profusion
of
curls
a
richly
braided
surtout
with
military
overalls
strapped
down
over
highly
varnished
boots
whose
hypocritical
heels
would
sport
a
pair
of
large
rowelled
ringing
brass
spurs
sometimes
he
was
a
jack
tar
with
a
little
glazed
hat
a
tie
a
checked
shirt
a
blue
jacket
roomy
trousers
and
pumps
and
before
the
admiring
ladies
had
well
digested
him
in
that
dress
he
would
be
seen
cantering
away
on
a
white
barb
in
a
with
leather
and
tops
he
was
things
by
turns
and
nothing
long
such
was
the
gentleman
elected
to
succeed
the
silent
slocdolager
in
the
important
office
of
master
of
the
laverick
wells
hunt
and
whatever
may
be
the
merits
of
either
upon
which
we
pass
no
opinion
it
can
not
be
denied
that
they
were
essentially
different
slocdolager
was
a
man
of
few
words
and
not
at
all
a
ladies
man
he
could
not
even
talk
when
he
was
crammed
with
wine
and
though
he
could
hold
a
good
quantity
people
soon
found
out
they
might
just
as
well
pour
it
into
a
jug
as
down
his
throat
so
they
gave
up
asking
him
out
he
was
a
man
of
few
coats
as
well
as
of
few
words
one
on
and
one
off
being
the
extent
of
his
wardrobe
his
scarlet
was
growing
and
the
rest
of
his
hunting
costume
has
been
already
glanced
at
he
lodged
above
smallbones
the
veterinary
surgeon
in
a
little
back
street
where
he
lived
in
the
quietest
way
dining
when
he
came
in
from
hunting
dressing
or
rather
changing
only
when
he
was
wet
hunting
each
fox
again
over
his
and
bundling
off
to
bed
long
before
many
of
his
had
left
the
he
was
little
better
than
a
better
sort
of
huntsman
waffles
as
we
said
before
had
made
himself
conspicuous
towards
the
close
of
slocdolager
reign
chiefly
by
his
dashing
costume
his
reckless
riding
and
his
way
of
blowing
up
and
slanging
people
indeed
a
stranger
would
have
taken
him
for
the
master
a
delusion
that
was
heightened
by
his
riding
with
a
in
the
shape
of
a
horn
at
his
saddle
save
when
engaged
in
sucking
this
his
tongue
was
never
at
fault
it
was
jabber

clapper
never
was
at
rest
like
all
noisy
chaps
too
he
could
not
bear
any
one
to
make
a
noise
but
himself
in
furtherance
of
this
he
called
in
the
aid
of
his
oxfordshire
rhetoric
he
would
halloo
people
designating
them
by
some
peculiarity
that
he
thought
he
could
wriggle
out
of
if
necessary
instead
of
attacking
them
by
name
thus
if
a
man
spoke
or
placed
himself
where
waffles
thought
he
ought
not
to
be
that
is
to
say
anywhere
but
where
waffles
was
himself
he
would
exclaim
sir
hold
your
tongue
you
sir
no
sir
not
you
the
man
that
speaks
as
if
he
had
a
brush
in
his
throat
or
come
away

narrow

present

still
he
was
a
rattling
fellow

masterships
of
hounds
memberships
of
parliament
all
expensive
offices
being
things
that
most
men
are
anxious
to
foist
upon
their
friends
waffles
big
talk
and
interference
in
the
field
procured
him
the
honour
of
the
first
refusal
not
that
he
was
the
man
to
refuse
for
he
jumped
at
the
offer
and
as
he
would
be
of
age
before
the
season
came
round
and
would
have
got
all
his
money
out
of
chancery
he
disdained
to
talk
about
a
subscription
and
boldly
took
the
hounds
as
his
own
he
then
became
a
very
important
personage
at
laverick
wells
he
had
always
been
a
most
important
personage
among
the
ladies
but
as
the
men
could
marry
him
those
who
did
want
to
borrow
money
of
him
of

ran
him
down

dandified

the
sight
of
him
makes
me
sick

smeared
with

arriving
at
this
conclusion
their

assisted

magnificent

went
to
work

the
whip
who
had
toiled
at
his
calling
for
twenty
long
years
on
fifty
pounds

what
he
could
up
was
advanced
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
with
a
couple
of
men
under
him
instead
of
riding

was
mounted
on

commotion

requires
a
fine

to
put

and
many
were
the
consultations

as
to
what
it
should
be
slocdolager
had
done
nothing
in
the
decorative
department
and
many
thought
the
failure
of
funds
was
a
good
deal
attributable
to
that
fact
waffles
was
not
the
man
to
lose
an
opportunity
of
adding
another
costume
to
his
wardrobe
and
after
an
infinity
of
trouble
and
trials
of
almost
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
he
at
length
settled
the
following
uniform

at

had
the
charm
of
novelty

recommend

looked
on
the

with
other
than
feelings
of
approbation
they
thought
it
a
pity

should
take
them

wished

astray

that
it
would
make
any
difference

them
looking
significantly
at

no
fox
had
been
hunted
by
more
hounds

been
by
the

with
fifty

might
have
found

from

extracted
it

of
her

the

of
the
honourable
miss
letitia
amelia
susannah
jemimah

in

of

displaced

some

waffles
was
reputed
to
be
made
of
money
and
he
went
at
it
as
though
he
thought
it
utterly
impossible
to
get
through
it
he
was
greatly
aided
in
his
endeavours
by
the
fact
of
its
being
all
in
the
funds
a
great
convenience
to
the
spendthrift
it
keeps
him
constantly
in
cash
and
enables
him
to
and
come
again
as
quick
as
ever
he
likes

what
with
time
spent
in
investigating
a

giving
notice
to

an
industrious
man
wants
a
second
loan
by
the
time
or
perhaps
before
he
gets
the
first
acres
are
not
easy
of
conversion
and
the
mere
fact
of
wanting
to
sell
implies
a
deficiency
somewhere
with
money
in
the
funds
a
man
has
nothing
to
do
but
lodge
a
power
of
attorney
with
his
broker
and
write
up
for
four
or
five
thousand
pounds
just
as
he
would
write
to
his
bootmaker
for
four
or
five
pairs
of
boots
the
only
difference
being
that
in
all
probability
the
money
would
be
down
before
the
boots
then
with
money
in
the
funds
a
man
keeps
up
his
credit
to
the
far
end
the
last
thousand
telling
no
more
tales
than
the
first
and
making
just
as
good
a
show
we
are
almost
afraid
to
say
what
waffles
means
were
but
we
really
believe
at
the
time
he
came
of
age
that
he
had
in
the
funds
which
were
nearly
at
a
term
expressive
of
each
hundred
being
worth
a
hundred
and
not
or
ninety
pounds
as
is
now
the
case
which
makes
a
considerable
difference
in
the
melting
now
a
real
always
counts
as
three
in
common
parlance
which
latter
sum
would
yield
a
larger
income
than
gilds
the
horizon
of
the
most
mercenary
mother
mind
say
ten
thousand
which
we
believe
is
generally
allowed
to
be
a
a
ry
handsome
no
wonder
then
that
waffles
was
such
a
hero
another
great
recommendation
about
him
was
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
be
much
plucked
many
of
the
young
men
of
fortune
that
appear
upon
town
have
lost
half
their
feathers
on
the
or
the
before
the
ladies
get
a
chance
at
them
but
here
was
a
nice
youth
with
all
his
downy
verdure
full
upon
him
it
takes
a
vast
of
clothes
even
at
oxford
prices
to
come
to
a
thousand
pounds
and
if
we
allow
four
or
five
thousand
for
his
other
extravagances
he
could
not
have
done
much
harm
to
a
hundred
thousand
our
friend
soon
finding
that
he
was
of
the
walk
had
no
notion
of
exchanging
his
greatness
for
the
nothingness
of
london
and
save
going
up
occasionally
to
see
about
opening
the
of
his
fortune
he
spent
nearly
the
whole
summer
at
laverick
wells
a
fine
season
it
was
too
the
finest
season
the
wells
had
ever
known
when
at
length
the
long
london
season
closed
there
was
a
rush
of
rank
and
fashion
to
the
english
quite
unparalleled
in
the
of
the
oldest
inhabitants
there
were
blooming
widows
in
every
stage
of
grief
and
woe
from
the
becoming
cap
to
the
fashionable
corset
and
ball
flounce
widows
who
would
never
forget
the
dear
deceased
or
think
of
any
other
man
he
had
at
least
five
thousand
a
lovely
girls
who
did
care
a
farthing
if
the
man
was
handsome
and
smiling
mammas
them
on
who
would
look
very
different
when
they
came
to
the
horrid
and
this
mercantile
expression
leads
us
to
the
observation
that
we
know
nothing
so
dissimilar
as
a
trading
town
and
a
in
the
one
all
is
bustle
hurry
and
activity
in
the
other
people
seem
to
know
what
to
do
to
get
through
the
day
the
city
and
present
somewhat
of
the
contrast
but
not
to
the
extent
of
manufacturing
or
towns
and
are
a
shade
better
than
in
the
way
of
occupation
for
people
can
sit
staring
at
the
sea
counting
the
ships
or
polishing
their
nails
with
a
shell
whereas
at
they
have
generally
little
to
do
but
stare
at
and
talk
of
each
other
and
mark
the
progress
of
the
day
by
alternately
drinking
at
the
wells
eating
at
the
hotels
and
wandering
between
the
library
and
the
railway
station
the
ladies
get
on
better
for
where
there
are
ladies
there
are
always
fine
shops
and
what
between
turning
over
the
goods
and
sweeping
the
streets
with
their
trains
making
calls
and
arranging
partners
for
balls
they
get
through
their
time
very
pleasantly
but
what
is
to
them
is
often
death

the
men

the

read
in

of
the

company
assembled
at

of
the
princely

of

it
would
be
a
very
likely
place
to
suit
him
accordingly
thither
he
despatched
leather
with
the

by
the
road
intending
to
follow
in
as
many
hours
by
the
rail
as
it
took
them
days
to
trudge
on

railways
have
helped
hunting
as
well
as
other
things
and
enables
a
man
to
glide
down
into
the
grass
as
buckram
calls
them
with
as
little
trouble
and
in
as
short
a
time
almost
as
it
took
him
to
accomplish
a
meet
at
croydon
or
at
the
magpies
at
staines
but
to
our
groom
and

sponge
was
too
good
a
judge
to
disfigure
the

a
difference
of
ten
pounds
in
the
looks
of
almost
any
horse
there
is
no
need
because
a
man
rides
a
hack
horse
to
proclaim
it
to
all
the
world
a
fact
that
few
hack
horse
letters
seem
to
be
aware
of
perhaps
indeed
they
think
to
advertise
them
by
means
of
their
inferior
appointments
leather

turned
out
in
a
very
brown

riding

indignant
at
the
idea
of
any
one
attempting

him
with
such
an
old

joke
so
leather
passed
on
through
the

lit
up

the

windowed

radiant
with

exhibiting
rich

leather
established
himself
at
the
livery
and
bait
stables
in
pegasus
street
or
peg
street
as
it
is
generally
called
where
he
enacted
the
character
of
to
perfection
doing
nothing
himself
but
seeing
that
others
did
his
work
and
strutting
consequentially
with
the
at
feeding
time
after
leather
long
london
experience
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
he
would
not
be
long
in
falling
in
with
some
old
acquaintance
at
a
place
like
the
and
the
first
night
fortunately
brought
him
in
contact
with
a
couple
of
grooms
who
had
had
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
when
in
all
the
radiance
of
his
wigged
prosperity
as
to
the
duke
of
dazzleton
and
who
knew
nothing
of
the
treadmill
or
his
subsequent
career
this
introduction
served
with
his
own
easy
assurance
and
the
deference
country
servants
always
pay
to
london
ones
at
once
to
give
him
standing
and
it
is
creditable
to
the
etiquette
of
servitude
to
say
that
on
joining
the
chop
and
mealy
potato
club
at
the
cat
and
bagpipes
on
the
second
night
after
his
arrival
the
whole
club
rose
to
receive
him
on
entering
and
placed
him
in
the
post
of
honour
on
the
right
of
the
president
he
was
very
soon
quite
at
home
with
the
whole
of
them
and
ready
to
tell
anything
he
knew
of
the
great
families
in
which
he
had
lived
of
course
he
abused
the
duke
place
and
said
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
him
at
last
quite
an
unpossible
man
to
live
with
indeed
his
only
wonder
was
that
he
had
been
able
to
put
hup
with
him
so
long
the
duchess
was
a
cretur
he
said
and
indeed
it
was
mainly
on
her
account
that
he
stayed
but
as
to
the
duke
he
was
everything
that
was
bad
in
short
sponge
on
the
other
hand
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
the
colours
in
which
his
painted

of
being
the
shirtless
strapper
of
a
couple
of
vicious
hack
hunters
leather
made
himself
out
to
be
the
general
superintendent
of
the
opulent
owner
of
a
large
stud
the
exact
number
varied
with
the
number
of
glasses
of
grog
leather
had
taken
but
he
never
had
less
than
a
dozen
and
sometimes
as
many
as
twenty
hunters
under
his
care
these
he
said
were
planted
all
over
the
kingdom
some
at
melton
to
with
the

some
at
northampton
to
with

did
know
who
what
a
fine
flattering
world
this
is
when
the
speaker
can
raise
his
own
consequence
by
our
elevation
one
would
think
that
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
had
gone
to
california
a
man
might
have
his
head
turned
by
hearing
the
description
given
of
him
by
his
friends
but
hear
the
same
party
on
the
tack
when
either
his
own
importance
is
not
involved
or
dire
offence
makes
it
worth
his
while
cut
off
his
nose
to
spite
his
face
no
one
would
recognize
the
portrait
then
drawn
as
one
of
the
same
individual
leather
as
we
said
before
was
in
the
laudatory
strain
but
like
many
indiscreet
people
he
overdid
it
not
content
with
magnifying
the
stud
to
the
liberal
extent
already
described
he
must
needs
puff
his
riding
and
indulge
in
insinuations
about
them
all
the
way
and
so
on
now
nothing

so
much
as
this
sort
of
threat
and
few
things
travel
quicker
than
these
sort
of
vapourings
to
their
masters
ears
indeed
we
can
only
excuse
the
lengths
to
which
leather
went
on
the
ground
of
his
previous
coaching
career
not
having
afforded
him
a
due
insight
into
the
delicacies
of

leather
in
an
undertone
with
a
wink
of
his
roguish
eye
and
jerk
of
his
head
towards
where
a
knot
of
them
stood
eyeing
our

most
intently

looking
about
the
thinly
peopled
station

with

he
too
might
accommodate
him
the
now
touched
his
hat
indicative
of
a
wish
to
be
off
having
a
fare
waiting
elsewhere
sponge
directed
him
to
proceed
to
the
brunswick
hotel
while
accompanied
by
leather
he
proceeded
on
foot
to
the
stables
leather
of
course
had
the
valuable
stud
under
lock
and
key
with
every
crevice
and
well
stuffed
with
straw
as
if
they
had
been
the
most
valuable
horses
in
the
world
having
produced
the
from
his
pocket
leather
opened
the
door
and
having
got
his
master
in
speedily
closed
it
lest
a
breath
of
fresh
air
might
intrude
having
lighted
a
lucifer
he
turned
on
the
gas
and
exhibited
the
horses
well
littered
in
straw
showing
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
pay
shillings
a
week
for
nothing
sponge
stood
eyeing
them
for
some
seconds
with
evident
approbation
any
one
asks
you
about
the
horses
you
can
say
they
are
you
know
at
length
observed
he
casually
with
an
emphasis
on
the
mine
course
replied
leather
mean
you
need
say
anything
about
their
being
observed
sponge
fearing
leather
might
exactly
trust
me
replied
leather
with
a
knowing
wink
and
a
jerk
of
his
elbow
against
his
master
side
trust
me
repeated
he
with
a
look
as
much
as
to
say
understand
each
other
hadded
a
few
to
them
indeed
continued
leather
looking
to
see
how
his
master
took
it
you
observed
sponge
inquiringly
made
out
that
you
as
good
as
twenty
one
way
or
another
observed
leather
some
there
all
over
in
fact
and
that
you
jest
run
about
the
country
and
with
comes
and
what
the
upshot
of
it
all
inquired
sponge
thinking
his
groom
seemed
wonderfully
enthusiastic
in
his
interest
the
hupshot
of
it
is
replied
leather
the
men
are
all
mad
and
the
women
all
wild

see

the
subject
by
giving
orders
for

sponge
appearance
being
decidedly
of
the
sporting
order
and
his
horses
maintaining
the
character
did
not
alleviate
the
agitated
minds
of
the
sporting
beholders
ruffled
as
they
were
with
the
threatening
vapouring
insinuations
of
the
peter

there
is
nothing

men
backs
up
so
readily
as
a
hint
that
any
one

coming
to
take
the
out
of
them
across
country
we
have
known
the
most
deadly
feuds
engendered
between
parties
who
never
spoke
to
each
other
by
adroit
reporting
to
each
what
the
other
said
or
perhaps
did
not
say
but
what
the
knew
would
so
rouse
the
british
lion
as
to
make
each
ride
to
destruction
if
necessary
a
chap
observed
waffles
as
the
party
returned
from
the
railway
station
wonder
if
he
can
go
dare
say
try
should
wonder
if
he
floored
awfully
stiff
country
this
for
horses
that
are
not
used
to
it
most
likely
his
are
leicestershire
nags
used
to
fly
wo
do
here
if
he
attempts
to
take
some
of
our
big
banked
bullfinches
in
his
stride
with
a
yawner
on
each
side
will
get
into
grief

interrupted

thornton

good

in

there
are
exclaimed
spareneck
the
rider
no
notion
of
a
fellow
lording
it
because
he
happens
to
come
out
of
leicestershire
rejoined
thornton
i
exclaimed
spareneck
does
he
stay
in
leicestershire
asked
hoppey
now
raising
his
voice
for
the
first
time
adding
asked
him
here
indeed
sneered
thornton
in
this
mood
our
friends
arrived
at
the
imperial
hotel
where
there
was
always
a
dinner
the
day
before
hunting
a
dinner
that
somehow
was
served
up
in
waffles
rooms
who
was
allowed
the
privilege
of
paying
for
all
those
who
did
not
pay
for
themselves
rather
a
considerable
number
we
believe
the
best
of
everything
being
good
enough
for
the
guests
and
profuse
liberality
the
order
of
the
day
the
cloth
generally
disappeared
before
a
contented
audience
whatever
humour
they
might
have
set
down
in
as
the
least
people
can
do
who
dine
at
an
inn
and
do
pay
their
own
shot
is
to
drink
the
health
of
the
man
who
does
pay
waffles
was
always
lauded
and
applauded
to
the
skies
such
a
master
such
a
sportsman
such
knowledge
such
science
such
a
on
this
occasion
the
toast
was
received
with
extra
enthusiasm
for
the
proposer
caingey
thornton
who
was
desperately
in
want
of
a
mount
after
going
the
rounds
of
the
old
laudatory
course
alluded
to
the
threatened
vapourings
of
the
stranger
and
expressed
his
firm
belief
that
he
would
with
his
match
a
of
the
bull
by
the
horns
that
met
with
very
considerable
favour
from
the
party
the
majority
of
whom
at
that
moment
made
very
in
their
own
minds
of
the
biggest
fence
that
ever
was
seen
there
is
nothing
so
easy
as
going
best
pace
over
the
mahogany
waffles
who
was
received
with
considerable
applause
and
patting
of
the
table
responded
to
the
toast
in
his
usual
felicitous
style
assuring
the
company
that
he
lived
but
for
the
enjoyment
of
their
charming
society
and
that
all
the
money
in
the
world
would
be
useless
if
he
had
laverick
wells
to
spend
it
in
with
regard
to
the
vapourings
of
a
gentleman
he
thought
it
would
be
very
odd
if
some
of
them
could
not
take
the
shine
out
of
him
observing
that
was
a
good
dog
but
was
a
better
with
certain
other
sporting
similes
and
phrases
all
indicative
of
showing
fight
the
steam
is
soon
got
up
after
dinner
and
as
they
were
all
of
the
same
mind
and
all
agreed
that
a
gross
insult
had
been
offered
to
the
hunt
in
general
and
themselves
in
particular
the
only
question
was
how
to
revenge
it
at
last
they
hit
upon
it
old
slocdolager
the
late
master
of
the
hunt
had
been
in
the
habit
of
having
tom
towler
the
huntsman
to
his
lodgings
the
night
before
hunting
where
over
a
glass
of
they
discussed
the
doings
of
the
day
and
the
general
arrangements
of
the
country
waffles
had
had
him
in
sometimes
though
for
a
different
purpose
at
least
in
reality
for
a
different
purpose
though
he
always
made
hunting
the
excuse
for
sending
for
him
and
that
purpose
was
to
try
how
many
silver
foxes
heads
full
of
port
wine
tom
could
carry
off
without
tumbling
and
the
old
fellow
being
rather
liquorishly
inclined
had
never
made
any
objection
to
the
experiment
waffles
now
wanted
him
to
endeavour
under
the
mellowing
influence
of
drink
to
get
him
to
enter
cordially
into
what
he
knew
would
be
distasteful
to
the
old
sportsman
feelings
namely
to
substitute
a
for
the
legitimate
find
and
chase
of
the
fox
though
exciting
and
exhilarating
at
all
times
except
perhaps
when
the
are
flying
and
the
sportsman
feels
that
in
all
probability
the
further
he
goes
the
further
he
is
left
behind
we
say
though
exciting
and
exhilarating
does
not
when
the
real
truth
is
spoken
present
such
conveniences
for
as
people
who
take
their
ideas
from
ackermann
window
imagine
that
there
are
large
places
in
most
fences
is
perfectly
true
but
that
there
are
also
weak
ones
is
also
the
fact
and
a
practised
eye
catches
up
the
latter
uncommonly
quick
therefore
though
a
madman
may
ride
at
the
big
places
a
sane
man
is
not
expected
to
follow
and
even
should
any
one
be
tempted
so
to
do
the
madman
having
acted
pioneer
will
have
cleared
the
way
or
at
all
events
proved
its
practicability
for
the
follower
in
addition
to
this
however
hounds
having
to
smell
as
they
go
can
not
travel
at
the
ultra
pace
so
opposed
to
before
you
leap
and
so
conducive
to
danger
and
difficulty
and
as
going
even
at
a
fair
pace
depends
upon
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
scent
the
fox
leaves
behind
it
is
evident
that
where
mere
daring
hard
riding
is
the
object
a
can
not
be
depended
upon
for
furnishing
the
necessary
accommodation
a
is
quite
a
different
thing
the
drag
can
be
made
to
any
strength
enabling
hounds
to
run
as
if
they
were
tied
to
it
and
can
be
trailed
so
as
to
bring
in
all
the
dangerous
places
in
the
country
with
a
certain
air
of
plausibility
enabling
a
man
to
look
round
and
exclaim
as
he
crams
at
a
bullfinch
or
brook
leading
us
over
a
most
desperate
country
never
saw
such
fencing
in
all
my
life
however
as
we
said
before
is
not
popular
with
sportsmen
certainly
not
with
huntsmen
and
though
our
friends
with
their
wounded
feelings
determined
to
have
one
they
had
yet
to
smooth
over
old
tom
to
get
him
to
come
into
their
views
that
was
now
the
difficulty
chapter
viii
old
tom
towler
illustration
there
are
few
more
difficult
persons
to
identify
than
a
huntsman
in
undress
and
of
all
queer
ones
perhaps
old
tom
towler
was
the
queerest
tom
in
his
person
furnished
an
apt
illustration
of
the
right
appropriation
of
talent
and
the
fitness
of
things
for
he
would
neither
have
made
a
groom
nor
a
coachman
nor
a
postillion
nor
a
footman
nor
a
ploughman
nor
a
mechanic
nor
anything
we
know
of
and
yet
he
was
as
a
huntsman
he
was
too
weak
for
a
groom
too
small
for
a
coachman
too
ugly
for
a
postillion
too
stunted
for
a
footman
too
light
for
a
ploughman
too
for
almost
anything
any
one
looking
at
him
in
would
exclaim
an
unfortunate
object
and
perhaps
offer
him
a
penny
while
in
his
hunting
habiliments
lords
would
hail
him
with
tom
how
are
you
and
baronets
ask
him
he
was
commoners
felt
honoured
by
his
countenance
and
yet
but
for
hunting
tom
would
have
been
wasted
a
cypher
an
inapplicable
sort
of
man
old
tom
in
his
scarlet
coat
black
cap
and
boots
and
tom
in
his
undress
say
shorts
grey
stockings
and
shoes
bore
about
the
same
resemblance
to
each
other
that
a
three
months
dead
jay
nailed
to
a
keeper
lodge
bears
to
the
bird
when
flying
about
on
horseback
tom
was
a
cockey
little
fellow
sitting
as
though
he
and
his
horse
were
all
one
while
on
foot
he
was
the
most
shambling
scambling
crab
that
ever
was
seen
he
was
a
complete
mash
of
a
man
he
had
been
scalped
by
the
branch
of
a
tree
his
nose
knocked
into
a
thing
like
a
button
by
the
kick
of
a
horse
his
teeth
sent
down
his
throat
by
a
fall
his
fractured
his
left
leg
broken
and
his
right
arm
ditto
to
say
nothing
of
damage
to
his
ribs
fingers
and
feet
and
having
had
his
face
scarified
like
pork
by
repeated
brushings
through
strong
thorn
fences
but
we
will
describe
him
as
he
appeared
before
waffles
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
laverick
wells
hunt
on
the
night
of
sponge
arrival
tom
spirit
being
roused
at
hearing
the
boastings
of
leather
and
thinking
perhaps
his
master
might
have
something
to
say
or
thinking
perhaps
to
partake
of
the
eleemosynary
drink
generally
going
on
in
large
houses
of
public
entertainment
had
taken
up
his
quarters
in
the
bar
of
the
where
he
was
attentively
perusing
the
in
reading
how
the
atherstone
met
at
gopsall
the
bedale
at
hornby
the
cottesmore
at
tilton
wood
and
so
on
with
an
industry
worthy
of
a
better
cause
for
tom
neither
knew
country
nor
places
nor
masters
nor
hounds
nor
huntsmen
nor
anything
though
he
still
felt
an
interest
in
reading
where
they
were
going
to
hunt
thus
he
sat
with
a
quick
ear
one
of
the
few
undamaged
organs
of
his
body
cocked
to
hear
if
tom
towler
was
asked
for
when
a
waiter
dropping
his
name
from
the
landing
of
the
staircase
to
the
hall
porter
asking
if
anybody
had
seen
anything
of
him
tom
folded
up
his
paper
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
passing
his
hand
over
the
few
straggling
bristles
yet
sticking
about
his
bald
head
proceeded
hat
in
hand
upstairs
to
his
master
room
his
appearance
called
forth
a
round
of
view
halloos
hark
forwards
amidst
which
and
the
waving
of
napkins
and
general
noises
tom
proceeded
at
a
twisting
limping
halting
sideways
sort
of
scramble
up
the
room
his
crooked
legs
did
seem
to
have
an
exact
understanding
with
his
body
which
way
they
were
to
go
one
the
right
one

went

determined
to

at

he
reached
the
top
of
the
table
where
sat
his
master
with
the
glittering
fox
head
before
him
having
made
a
sort
of

tom
proceeded
to
stand
at
ease
as
it
were
on
the
left
leg
while
he
placed
the
late
recusant
right
which
was
a
trifle
shorter
as
a
prop
behind
no
one
to
look
at
the
little
wizen
old
man
in
the
loose
dark

striped

and
patent

extending
below
where
the

of

have
supposed

it
was
the
noted
huntsman

dashing

tom

whose
name
was
celebrated
throughout

he
might
have
been
a

anything
but
a

taking
up
the

at

to

he
quaffed
it
off
at

handing

another

said
old
tom
quaffing
off
the
measure
as
before
a
flush
of
life
came
into
his
face
just
as

draw
him
out
tom
was
silent
he
was
a
hunting
huntsman
not
a
riding
one
a
glass
of
something
said
waffles
again
appealing
to
the
head
you
sir
i
had
a
glass
replied
tom
sinking
the
second
one
will
you
have
asked
waffles
if
you
please
replied
tom
it
is
rejoined
waffles
again
handing
him
the
measure
up
went
the
cup
over
went
the
contents
but
tom
set
it
down
with
a
less
satisfied
face
than
before
he
had
had
enough
the
left
leg
prop
too
gave
way
and
he
was
nearly
toppling
on
the
table
having
got
a
chair
for
the
dilapidated
old
man
they
again
essayed
to
get
him
into
their
line
with
better
success
than
before
having
plied
him
well
with
port
they
now
plied
him
well
with
the
stranger
and
what
with
the
one
and
the
other
and
a
glass
or
two
of
tom
became
very
tractable
and
it
was
ultimately
arranged
that
they
should
have
a
drag
over
the
very
stiffest
parts
of
the
country
wherein
all
who
liked
should
take
part
but
that
caingey
thornton
and
spareneck
should
be
especially
deputed
to
wait
upon
sponge
and
lead
him
into
mischief
of
course
it
was
to
be
a
secret
and
equally
of
course
it
stood
a
good
chance
of
being
kept
seeing
how
many
were
in
it
the
additional
number
it
would
have
to
be
communicated
to
before
it
could
be
carried
out
and
the
happy
state
old
tom
was
in
for
arranging
matters
nevertheless
our
friends
at
the
congratulated
themselves
on
their
success
and
after
a
few
minutes
spent
in
discussing
old
tom
on
his
withdrawal
the
party
broke
up
to
array
themselves
in
the
splendid

early
to

and
early
to
rise
being
among
sponge
maxims
he
was
enjoying
the
view
of
the
pantiles
at
the
back
of
his
hotel
shortly
after
daylight
the
next
morning
a
time
about
as
difficult
to
fix
in
a
november
day
as
the
age
of
a
lady
of
a
age
it
takes
even
an
expeditious
dresser
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
extra
the
first
time
he
has
to
deal
with
boots
and
breeches
and
sponge
being
quite
a
pattern
card
in
his
peculiar
line
of
course
took
a
good
deal
more
to
get
himself
an
accustomed
eye
could
see
a
more
than
ordinary
stir
in
the
streets
that
morning
and
their
assistants
might
be
seen
going
along
with
strings
of
saddled
and
screws
flys
began
to
roll
at
an
earlier
hour
and
natty
tigers
to
kick
about
in
buckskins
prior
to
departing
with
hunters
good
bad
and
indifferent
each
man
had
told
his
partner
at
miss
jumpheavy
ball
of
the
capital
trick
they
were
going
to
play
the
stranger
and
a
desire
to
see
the
stranger
far
more
than
a
desire
to
see
the
trick
caused
many
fair
ones
to
forsake
their
downy
couches
who
had
much
better
have
kept
them
the
world
is
generally
very
complaisant
with
regard
to
strangers
so
long
as
they
strangers
generally
making
them
out
to
be
a
good
deal
better
than
they
really
are
and
sponge
came
in
for
his
full
share
of
stranger
credit
they
not
only
brought
all
the
twenty
horses
leather
said
he
had
scattered
about
to
laverick
wells
but
made
him
out
to
have
a
house
in
eaton
square
a
yacht
at
cowes
and
a
moor
in
scotland
and
some
said
a
peerage
in
expectancy
no
wonder
that
he
as
theatrical
people
say
let
us
now
suppose
him
breakfasted
and
ready
for
a
start
he
was
up
with
uncommon
care
in
the
most
complete
style
of
the
severe
order
of
sporting
costume
it
being
now
the
commencement
of
the
legitimate
hunting
season
the
first
week
in
november
he
availed
himself
of
the
privileged
period
for
turning
out
in
everything
new
rejecting
the
now
generally
worn
cap
he
adhered
to
the
heavy
hat
described
in
our
opening
chapter
whose
connexion
with
his
head
or
back
if
it
came
off
was
secured
by
a
small
black
silk
cord
hooked
through
the
band
by
a
fox
tooth
and
anchored
to
a
button
inside
the
haven
of
his
low
his
neck
was
enveloped
in
the
ample
folds
of
a
large
white
silk
cravat
tied
in
a
pointing
diamond
tie
and
secured
with
a
large
silver
pin
the
shoe
being
almost
large
enough
for
the
foot
of
a
young
donkey
his
low
coat
was
of
the
infinitesimal
order
that
is
to
say
a
coat
and
yet
as
little
of
a
coat
as
possible
very
near
a
jacket
in
fact
the
seams
of
course
were
outside
and
were
it
not
for
the
extreme
strength
and
evenness
of
the
sewing
and
the
evident
intention
of
the
thing
an
ignorant
person
might
have
supposed
that
he
had
had
his
coat
turned
a
double
layer
of
cloth
extended
the
full
length
of
the
outside
of
the
sleeves
much
in
the
fashion
of
the
greatcoats
in
former
times
and
instead
of
cuffs
the
sleeves
were
carried
out
to
the
ends
of
the
fingers
leaving
it
to
the
fancy
of
the
wearer
to
sport
a
long
cuff
or
a
short
cuff
or
no
cuff
at
all
just
as
the
weather
dictated
though
the
coat
was
he
had
a
hole
made
on
the
button
side
to
enable
him
to
keep
it
together
by
means
of
a
miniature
snaffle
instead
of
a
button
the
snaffle
passed
across
his
chest
from
whence
the
coatee
flowing
easily
back
displayed
the
broad
ridge
and
furrow
of
a
white
cord
waistcoat
with
a
low
step
collar
the
vest
reaching
low
down
his
figure
with
large
flap
pockets
and
a
nick
out
in
front
like
a
coachman
instead
of
buttons
the
waistcoat
was
secured
with
foxes
tusks
and
catgut
loops
while
a
heavy
curb
chain
passing
from
one
pocket
to
the
other
raised
the
impression
that
there
was
a
watch
in
one
and
a
bunch
of
seals
in
the
other
the
waistcoat
was
broadly
bound
with
white
binding
and
like
the
coat
evinced
great
strength
and
powers
of
resistance
his
breeches
were
of
a
still
broader
furrow
than
the
waistcoat
looking
as
if
the
ploughman
had
laid
two
ridges
into
one
they
came
low
down
the
leg
and
were
met
by
a
pair
of
well
put
on
very
brown
topped
boots
a
colour
then
unknown
at
laverick
wells
his
spurs
were
bright
and
heavy
with
formidable
necks
and
rowels
whose
slightest
touch
would
make
a
horse
wince
and
put
him
on
his
good
behaviour
nor
did
the
great
slapping
brown
horse
hercules
turn
out
less
imposingly
than
his
master
leather
though
not
the
man
to
work
himself
had
a
very
good
idea
of
work
and
right
manfully
he
made
the
helpers
at
the
eclipse
livery
and
bait
stables
strap
and
groom
his
horses
hercules
was
a
fine
animal
it
did
not
require
a
man
to
be
a
great
judge
of
a
horse
to
see
that
even
the
ladies
though
perhaps
they
would
rather
have
had
him
a
white
or
a
cream
colour
could
not
but
admire
his
muzzle
his
glossy
coat
his
silky
mane
and
the
elegant
way
in
which
he
carried
his
flowing
tail
his
step
was
delightful
to
look
at
so
free
so
accurate
and
so
easy
and
that
reminds
us
that
we
may
as
well
be
getting
sponge
up
a
feat
of
no
easy
accomplishment
few
hack
hunters
are
without
their
little
peculiarities
some
are
runaways
some
kick
some
bite
some
go
tail
first
on
the
road
some
go
tail
first
at
their
fences
some
rush
as
if
they
were
going
to
eat
them
others
baulk
them
altogether
and
few
very
few
give
satisfaction
those
that
do
generally
retire
from
the
public
stud
to
the
private
one
but
to
our
particular
quadruped
sponge
was
not
without
his
misgivings
that
regardless
of
being
on
his
preferment
the
horse
might
exhibit
more
of
his
peculiarity
than
would
forward
his
master
interests
and
independently
of
the
disagreeableness
of
being
kicked
off
at
the
cover
side
not
being
always
compensated
for
by
falling
soft
sponge
thought
as
the
meet
was
not
far
off
and
he
did
not
sport
a
cover
hack
it
would
look
quite
as
well
to
ride
his
horse
quietly
on
as
go
in
a
fly
provided
always
he
could
accomplish
the
mount
the
mount
like
the
man
walking
with
his
head
under
his
arm
being
the
first
step
to
everything
accordingly
leather
had
the
horse
saddled
and
accoutred
as
quietly
as
possible
his
warm
clothing
put
over
the
saddle
immediately
and
everything
kept
as
much
in
the
usual
course
as
possible
so
that
the
noble
temper
might
not
be
ruffled
by
unaccustomed
trouble
or
unusual
objects
leather
having
seen
that
the
horse
could
not
eject
sponge
even
in
trousers
had
little
fear
of
his
dislodging
him
in
boots
and
breeches
still
it
was
desirable
to
avoid
all
unseemly
contention
and
maintain
the
high
character
of
the
stud
by
which
means
leather
felt
that
his
own
character
and
consequence
would
best
be
maintained
accordingly
he
refrained
from
calling
in
the
aid
of
any
of
the
stable
assistants
preferring
for
once
to
do
a
little
work
himself
especially
when
the
rider
was
up
to
the
trick
and
not
gent
to
be
cajoled
into
a
horse
sponge
punctual
to
his
time
appeared
at
the
stable
and
after
much
patting
whistling
so
so
ing
my
man
and
general
ingratiation
the
redoubtable
nag
was
led
out
of
the
stable
into
a
where
though
he
might
be
gored
by
a
bull
if
he
fell
the
of
at
all
events
would
not
witness
the
floorer
horses
however
have
wonderful
memories
and
discrimination
though
so
differently
attired
to
what
he
was
on
the
occasion
of
his
trial
the
horse
seemed
to
recognize
sponge
and
independently
of
a
few
snorts
as
he
was
led
out
and
an
indignant
stamp
or
two
of
his
foot
as
it
was
let
down
after
sponge
was
mounted
he
took
things
very
quietly
said
leather
in
an
undertone
patting
the
horse
arched
neck
give
you
a
hint
they
a
goin
to
run
a
drag
to
try
what
he
made
on
so
be
on
the
do
you
know
asked
sponge
in
surprise
drawing
his
reins
as
he
spoke
replied
leather
with
a
wink
just
then
the
horse
began
to
plunge
and
paw
and
give
symptoms
of
uneasiness
and
not
wishing
to
fret
or
exhibit
his
weak
points
sponge
gave
him
his
head
and
passing
through
the
was
presently
in
the
street
he
did
exactly
understand
it
but
having
full
confidence
in
his
horsemanship
and
believing
the
one
he
was
on
required
nothing
but
riding
he
was
not
afraid
to
take
his
chance
not
being
the
man
to
put
his
candle
under
a
bushel
sponge
took
the
principal
streets
on
his
way
out
of
town
we
are
not
sure
that
he
did
not
go
rather
out
of
his
way
to
get
them
in
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
seeing
he
was
a
stranger
who
did
know
the
way
what
a
sensation
his
appearance
created
as
the
gallant
brown
stepped
proudly
and
freely
up
coronation
street
showing
his
smart
clean
head
up
and
down
on
the
unrestrained
freedom
of
the
snaffle
d
n
it
there
he
is
exclaimed
spareneck
jumping
up
from
the
and
nearly
sweeping
the
contents
off
by
catching
the
cloth
with
his
spur
exclaimed
voices
amid
a
general
rush
to
the
windows
a
fright
exclaimed
little
miss
martindale
whispering
into
miss
beauchamp
ear
sure
anybody
may
have
him
for
me
though
she
felt
in
her
heart
that
he
was
far
from
bad
looking
wonder
how
long
he
taken
to
put
on
that
choker
observed
spareneck
eyeing
him
intently
not
without
an
inward
qualm
that
he
had
set
himself
a
more
difficult
task
than
he
imagined
to
him
down
especially
when
he
looked
at
the
noble
animal
he
bestrode
and
the
masterly
way
he
sat
him
a
pair
of
profligate
boots
observed

down
from

man
in
scarlet
sets
all
the
rest
on
the
fidget
and
without
troubling
to
lay
or
that
together
they
desert
their
breakfasts
hurry
to
the
stables
get
out
their
horses
and
rattle
away
lest
their
watches
should
be
wrong
or
some
arrangement
made
that
they
are
ignorant
of
the
hounds
too
were
on
as
was
seen
as
well
by
their
footmarks
as
by
the
bob
bob
bobbing
of
sundry
black
caps
above
the
hedges
on
the
borrowdon
road
as
the
huntsman
and
whips
proceeded
at
that
pleasant
trot
that
has
roused
the
wrath
of
so
many
riders
against
horses
that
they
could
not
get
to
keep
in
time
now
look
at
old
tom
cocked
jauntily
on
the
spicey
bay
and
see
what
a
different
tom
he
is
to
what
he
was
last
night
instead
of
a
battered
limping
little
old
man
he
is
all
alive
and
rises
to
the
action
of
his
horse
as
though
they
were
all
one
a
fringe
of
grey
hair
protrudes
beneath
his
smart
velvet
cap
which
sets
off
a
but
keen
and
expressive
face
lit
up
with
little
piercing
black
eyes
see
how
chirpy
and
cheery
he
is
how
his
right
arm
keeps
rising
and
falling
with
his
whip
beating
responsive
to
the
horse
action
with
the
against
his
thigh
his
new
scarlet
coat
imparts
a
healthy
hue
to
his
face
and
good
boots
and
breeches
hide
the
imperfections
of
his
bad
legs
his
hounds
seem
to
partake
of
the
old
man
gaiety
and
gather
round
his
horse
or
frolic
forward
on
the
grassy
sidings
of
the
road
till
getting
almost
out
of
earshot
a
single
doit
arrogant
or
again
brusher
brings
them
cheerfully
back
to
whine
and
look
in
the
old
face
for
applause
nor
is
he
chary
of
his
praise
oood
betch
arrogant
g
oood
betch
says
he
leaning
over
his
shoulder
towards
her
and
jerking
his
hand
to
induce
her
to
proceed
forward
again
so
the
old
man
trots
gaily
on
now
making
of
his
horse
now
coaxing
a
hound
now
talking
to
a
now
touching
or
taking
off
his
cap
as
he
passes
a
sportsman
according
to
the
estimation
in
which
he
holds
him
as
the
hounds
reach
whirleypool
windmill
there
is
a
grand
rush
of
pedestrians
to
meet
them
first
comes
a
keeper
with
whom
tom
albeit
suspicious
of
his
honesty
thinks
it
prudent
to
shake
hands
the
miller
and
he
too
greet
and
forthwith
a
black
bottle
with
a
single
glass
make
their
appearance
and
pass
current
with
the
company
then
the
draws
nigh
and
resting
a
hand
on
tom
horse
shoulder
whispers
confidentially
in
his
ear
the
pedestrian
sportsman
of
the
country
too
has
something
to
say
also
a
while
groups
of
children
stand
staring
at
the
mighty
tom
thinking
him
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
railways
and
make
most
people
punctual
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
from
the
halting
of
the
hounds
by
the
windmill
the
various
roads
leading
up
to
it
emit
grooms
who
dismounting
proceed
to
brush
off
the
mud
sparks
and
rectify
any
little
derangement
the
horses
or
their
accoutrements
may
have
contracted
on
the
journey
presently
sponge
and
such
other
gentlemen
as
have
ridden
their
own
horses
on
cast
up
while
from
the
eminence
the
road
to
laverick
wells
is
distinctly
traceable
with
scarlet
coats
and
flys
with
furs
and
flaunting
feathers
presently
the
foremost
riders
begin
to
canter
up
the
hill
when
all
around
is
gay
men
horses
dogs
and
in
each
smiling
countenance
appears
fresh
blooming
health
and
universal
joy
then
the
ladies
mingle
with
the
scene
some
on
horseback
some
in
flys
all
chatter
and
prattle
as
usual
some
saying
smart
things
some
trying
all
making
themselves
as
agreeable
as
possible
and
of
course
as
captivating
some
were
in
ecstasies
at
dear
miss
jumpheavy
ball
she
was
such
a
creature
such
a
charming
ball
and
so
well
managed
while
others
were
anticipating
the
delights
of
tom
hoppey
and
some
again
were
asking
which
was
sponge
then
up
went
the
while
sponge
sat
looking
as
innocent
and
as
killing
as
he
could
me
exclaimed
one
younger
than
i
thought
him
is
it
observed
another
saw
him
ride
up
the
street
while
the
ones
praised
his
horse
and
said
it
was
a
beauty
the
hounds
which
they
all
had
come
to
see
were
never
looked
at
waffles
like
many
men
with
nothing
to
do
was
most
unpunctual
he
never
seemed
to
know
what
it
was
and
yet
he
had
a
watch
hung
in
chains
and
gewgaws
like
a
lady
chatelaine
hunting
partook
of
the
general
confusion
he
did
not
profess
to
throw
off
till
eleven
but
it
was
often
nearly
twelve
before
he
cast
up
then
he
would
come
up
full
tilt
surrounded
by
like
a
general
with
his
staff
and
once
at
the
meet
there
was
a
prodigious
hurry
to
begin
equalled
only
by
the
eagerness
to
leave
off
on
this
auspicious
day
he
hove
in
sight
coming
best
pace
along
the
road
about
twenty
minutes
before
twelve
with
a
more
numerous
retinue
than
usual

and
so
on
on
this
occasion
he
sported
a

three

four
blue
lines
and
then
a
white
space
followed
by
three
or
more
blue
lines
the
whole
terminating
in
blue
spots
about
the
size
of
fourpenny
pieces
at
the
points
a
blue
silk
tie
with
white
spots
and
flying
ends
his
coat
was
a
light
jackety
sort
of
thing
with
little
pockets
behind
something
in
the
style
of
sponge
a
docked
but
wanting
the
outside
seaming
back
strapping
and
general
strength
that
characterized
sponge
his
waistcoat
of
course
was
a
worked
one
mingled
with
foxes
heads
on
a
true
blue
ground
the
gift
of
we
not
say
who
his
leathers
were
of
the
finest
and
his
boots
so
thin
as
to
put
all
idea
of
wet
or
mud
out
of
the
question
such
was
the
youth
who
now
cantered
up
and
took
off
his
cap
to
the
rank
beauty
and
fashion
assembled
at
whirleypool
windmill
he
then
proceeded
to
pay
his
respects
in
detail
at
length
having
exhausted
his
and
said
the
same
thing
over
again
in
a
dozen
different
ways
to
a
dozen
different
ladies
he
gave
a
slight
jerk
of
the
head
to
tom
towler
who
forthwith
whistled
his
hounds
together
and
attended
by
the
whips
bustled
from
the
scene
illustration
captain
greatgun
epping

in
its
most
palmy
days
could
not
equal
the
exhibition
that
now
took
place
some
of
the
more
lively
of
the
horses
tired
of
waiting
perhaps
pinched
by
the
cold
for
most
of
them
were
newly
clipped
evinced
their
approbation
of
the
move
by
sundry
squeals
and
capers
which
being
caught
by
others
in
the
neighbourhood
the
infection
quickly
spread
and
in
less
than
a
minute
there
was
such
a
scene
of
rocking
and
rearing
and
kicking
and
prancing
and
neighing
and
shooting
over
heads
and
rolling
over
tails
and
hanging
on
by
manes
mingled
with
such
screamings
from
the
ladies
in
the
flys
and
such
kicks
against
splash
boards
and
fly
bottoms
from
sundry
of
the
vicious
ones
in
harness
as
never
was
witnessed
one
gentleman
in
a
scarlet
mounted
on
a
flourishing
piebald

pawing
and
fighting
the

as
if
in

circle

unfortunate
rider
clinging
round
his
neck
expecting
to
have
the
beast
back
over
upon
him
another
little
wiry
chestnut
with
abundance
of
rings
racing
martingale
and
tackle
generally
just
turned
tail
on
the
crowd
and
ran
off
home
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
lay
legs
to
the
ground

a
good

with
a

selected
the

to
lie
down
to
the
horror
of
his
rider

of
the
royal
navy

feeling
himself
suddenly
touch

he
was
going
to
be
swallowed
up
alive
and
was
only
awoke
from
the
delusion
by
the
shouts
of
the
foot

telling
him
to
get
clear
of
his
horse
before
he
began
to
roll

fain
have
joined
the
truant
set
and
at
the
first
commotion
up
went
his
great
back
and
down
went
his
ears
with
a
single
lash
out
behind
that
meant
mischief
but
sponge
was
on
the
alert
and
just
gave
him
such
a
dig
with
his
spurs
as
restored
order
without
exposing
anything
that
anybody
could
take
notice

strong
as

seeing

as
careful
of

as

as
not
to

fine
strong
steady

and
quiet

go
the

go
faster
and

is
thrown
behind
them
just
as

at

by

they
are
rewarded
by

up

the
splashing
of
some

in

and
the
shaking
of

opposite

that
as

are
pretty
true

grinning

nearly
double

well
by

too
good
to

accordingly
he
availed
himself
of
a
heavy
fallow
upon
which
he
landed
as
he
cleared
the
brook
for
pulling
up
and
returned
just
as
spareneck
assisted
by
one
of
the
whips
succeeded
in
landing
caingey
on
the
side
caingey
was
not
a
pretty
boy
at
the
best
of
times
none
but
the
most
partial
parents
could
think
him
one
and
his
short
compressed
face
and
thick
lumpy
figure
were
anything
but
improved
by
a
sort
of
of
with
which
he
arose
from
his
bath
he
was
uncommonly
well
soaked
and
had
to
be
held
up
by
the
heels
to
let
the
water
run
out
of
his
boots
pockets
and
clothes
in
this
undignified
position
he
was
found
by
waffles
and
such
of
the
field
as
had
ridden
the
line
caingey
old
boy
you
look
like
a
boiled
porpoise
with
parsley
sauce
exclaimed
waffles
pulling
up
where
the
unfortunate
youth
was
spluttering
and
getting
emptied
like
a
jug
it
added
he
as
the
water
came
gurgling
out
of
his
mouth
you
must
have
drunk
the
brook
dry
caingey
would
have
censured
his
inhumanity
but
knowing
the
imprudence
of
quarrelling
with
his
bread
and
butter
and
also
aware
of
the
laughable
figure
he
must
then
be
cutting
he
thought
it
best
to
laugh
and
take
his
change
out
of
waffles
another
time
accordingly
he
chuckled
and
laughed
too
though
his
jaws
nearly
refused
their
office
and
kindly
transferred
the
blame
of
the
accident
from
the
horse
to
himself

did
put
on
steam
enough
he
said
meanwhile
old
tom
who
had
gone
on
with
the
hounds
having
availed
himself
of
a
bridge
a
little
above
where
thornton
went
in
for
getting
over
the
brook
and
having
allowed
a
sufficient
time
to
elapse
for
the
proper
completion
of
the
farce
was
now
seen
rounding
the
opposite
hill
with
his
hounds
clustered
about
his
horse
with
his
mind
conning
over
one
of
those
imaginary
runs
that
experienced
huntsmen
know
so
well
how
to
tell
when
there
is
no
one
to
contradict
them
having
quartered
his
ground
to
get
at
his
old
friend
the
bridge
again
he
just
trotted
up
with
gaiety
as
caingey
thornton
spluttered
the
last
piece
of
green
weed
out
from
between
his
great
thick
lips
tom
exclaimed
waffles
have
you
done
with
him
him
sir
replied
tom
with
a
slight
touch
of
his
cap
as
though
was
a
matter
of
occurrence
with
them
you
indeed
exclaimed
waffles
adopting
the
lie
with
avidity
sir
said
tom
gravely
was
nearly
beat
afore
he
got
to
the
brook
indeed
i
thought
vanquisher
would
have
had
him
in
it
but
however
he
got
through
and
the
scent
failed
on
the
fallow
which
gave
him
a
chance
but
i
held
them
on
to
the
hedgerow
beyond
where
they
hit
it
off
like
wildfire
and
they
never
stopped
again
till
they
tumbled
him
over
at
the
back
of
plummey
at
shapwick
i
got
his
brush
added
tom
producing
a
much
tattered
one
from
his
pocket
you
like
to
have
it
you
no
yes
no
replied
waffles
not
wanting
to
be
bothered
with
it
stay
continued
he
as
his
eye
caught
sponge
who
was
still
on
foot
beside
his
vanquished
friend
it
to
added
he
nodding
towards
our
hero
observed
tom
in
an
undertone
giving
the
brush
to
his
master
sponge
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
accept
the
brush
asked
waffles
advancing
with
it
towards
him
adding
am
sorry
this
unlucky
bather
should
have
prevented
your
seeing
the
end
sponge
was
a
pretty
good
judge
of
brushes
and
not
a
bad
one
of
camphire
but
if
this
one
had
smelt
twice
as
strong
as
it
did
indeed
if
it
had
dropped
to
pieces
in
his
hand
or
the
moths
had
flown
up
in
his
face
he
would
have
pocketed
it
seeing
it
paved
the
way
to
what
he
wanted
an
introduction
very
much
obliged
i
sure
observed
he
advancing
to
take
it
much
obliged
indeed
been
an
extremely
good
run
and
fast
fair
very
fair
observed
waffles
as
though
it
were
nothing
in
their
way
miles
in
twenty
minutes
i
suppose
or
something
of
that
sort
interposed
tom
with
a
laudable
anxiety
for
accuracy
rejoined
waffles
thought
it
would
be
somewhere
thereabouts
well
i
suppose
we
all
had
enough
added
he
as
well
go
home
and
have
some
luncheon
and
then
a
game
at
billiards
or
rackets
or
something
how
the
old
added
he
turning
to
thornton
who
was
now
busy
emptying
his
cap
and
mopping
the
velvet
the
was
as
well
as
could
be
expected
but
did
not
quite
like
the
new
aspect
of
affairs
he
saw
that
sponge
was
a
horseman
and
also
knew
that
nothing
ingratiated
one
man
with
another
so
much
as
skill
and
boldness
in
the
field
it
was
by
that
means
indeed
that
he
had
established
himself
in
waffles
good
graces
an
ingratiation
that
had
been
pretty
serviceable
to
him
both
in
the
way
of
meat
drink
mounting
and
money
had
sponge
been
like
himself
a
needy
penniless
adventurer
caingey
would
have
tried
to
have
kept
him
out
by
some
of
those
plausible
admonitory
hints
that
poverty
makes
men
so
obnoxious
to
but
in
the
case
of
a
rich
flourishing
individual
with
such
an
astonishing
stud
as
leather
made
him
out
to
have
it
was
clearly
caingey
policy
to
knock
under
and
be
subservient
to
sponge
also
caingey
we
should
observe
was
a
bold
reckless
rider
never
seeming
to
care
for
his
neck
but
he
was
no
match
for
sponge
who
had
both
skill
and
courage
caingey
being
at
length
cleansed
from
his
weeds
wiped
from
his
mud
and
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
was
now
hoisted
on
to
the
renowned
horse
again
who
had
scrambled
out
of
the
brook
on
the
side
and
after
meandering
the
banks
for
a
certain
distance
had
been
caught
by
the
bridle
in
the
branch
of
a
willow
caingey
we
say
being
again
mounted
sponge
also
without
hindrance
from
the
resolute
brown
horse
the
first
whip
put
himself
a
little
in
advance
while
old
tom
followed
with
the
hounds
and
the
second
whip
mingled
with
the
now
increasing
field
it
being
generally
understood
by
the
uninitiated
at
least
that
hounds
have
no
business
to
go
home
so
long
as
any
gentleman
is
inclined
for
a
scurrey
no
matter
whether
he
has
joined
early
or
late
waffles
on
the
contrary
was
very
easily
satisfied
and
never
took
the
shine
off
a
run
with
a
kill
by
risking
a
subsequent
defeat
old
tom
though
keen
when
others
were
keen
was
not
indifferent
to
his
comforts
and
soon
came
into
the
way
of
thinking
that
it
was
just
as
well
to
get
home
to
his
at
two
or
three
as
to
be
groping
his
way
about
bottomless
on
dark
winter
nights
as
he
retraced
his
steps
homeward
and
overtook
the
scattered
field
of
the
morning
his
talent
for
invention
or
rather
stretching
was
again
called
into
requisition
have
you
done
with
him
tom
asked
major
bouncer
eagerly
bringing
his
sturdy
cob
alongside
of
our
huntsman
him
sir
replied
tom
with
the
slightest
possible
touch
of
the
cap
bouncer
was
no
tip
exclaimed
bouncer
gaily
with
that
sort
of
sham
satisfaction
that
most
people
express
about
things
that
ca
concern
them
in
the
least
i
deuced
glad
of
that
where
did
you
kill
him
the
back
of
plummey
at
shapwick
replied
tom
adding
my
word
he
led
us
a
dance
afore
we
got
there
up
to
ditchington
down
to
somerby
round
by
temple
bell
wood
cross
goosegreen
common
then
away
for
stubbington
brooms
skirtin
sanderwick
plantations
but
scarce
goin
into
then
by
the
round
hill
at
camerton
leavin
great
heatherton
to
the
right
and
so
straight
on
to
shapwick
where
we
killed
with
every
hound
up
bless
me
exclaimed
bouncer
apparently
lost
in
admiration
though
he
scarcely
knew
the
country
bless
me
repeated
he
a
run
the
finest
run
that
ever
was
seen
miles
in
minutes
replied
tom
tacking
on
a
little
both
for
time
and
distance
jove
exclaimed
the
major
having
shaken
hands
with
and
congratulated
waffles
most
eagerly
and
earnestly
the
major
hurried
off
to
tell
as
much
as
he
could
remember
to
the
first
person
he
met
just
as
the
at
a
christening
looks
out
for
some
one
to
give
the
cheese
to
the
on
this
occasion
was
doctor
lotion
who
was
going
to
visit
old
jackey
thompson
of
woolleyburn
jackey
being
then
in
a
somewhat
precarious
state
of
health
and
tolerably
advanced
in
life
without
any
very
heir
was
obnoxious
to
the
attentions
of
three
distinct
litters
of
cousins
some
one
or
other
of
whom
was
constantly
him
lotion
though
a
sapient
man
and
somewhat
grinding
in
his
practice
did
not
profess
to
grind
old
people
young
again
and
feeling
he
could
do
very
little
for
the
body
corporate
directed
his
attention
to
amusing
jackey
mind
and
anything
in
the
shape
of
gossip
was
extremely
acceptable
to
the
doctor
to
retail
to
his
patient
moreover
jackey
had
been
a
bit
of
a
sportsman
and
was
always
extremely
happy
to
see
the
hounds
anybody
land
but
his
so
lotion
got
primed
with
the
story
and
having
gone
through
the
usual
routine
of
asking
his
patient
how
he
was
how
he
had
slept
looking
at
his
tongue
and
reporting
on
the
weather
when
the
old
posing
question
the
news
was
put
lotion
replied
as
he
too
often
had
to
reply
for
he
was
a
very
slow
hand
at
picking
up
information
particklar
i
think
sir
adding
in
an
sort
of
way
heard
of
the
greet
run
i
sir
run
exclaimed
the
octogenarian
as
if
it
was
a
matter
of
the
most
vital
importance
to
him
run
sir
no
sir
not
a
word
the
doctor
then
retailed
it
old
jackey
got
possessed
of
this
one
idea
he
thought
of
nothing
else
whoever
came
he
out
with
it
chapter
and
verse
with
occasional
variations
he
told
it
to
all
the
in
waiting
jackey
thompson
of
carrington
ford
jackey
thompson
of
houndesley
jackey
thompson
of
the
mill
and
all
the
bobs
bills
sams
harrys
and
peters
composing
the
respective
litters
forgetting
where
he
got
it
from
he
nearly
told
it
back
to
lotion
himself
we
sometimes
see
old
people
affected
this
way
far
more
enthusiastic
on
a
subject
than
young
ones
few
dread
the
aspect
of
affairs
so
much
as
those
who
have
little
chance
of
seeing
how
they
go
but
to
the
run
the
cousins
reproduced
the
story
according
to
their
respective
powers
of
exaggeration
one
tacked
on
two
miles
another
ten
and
so
it
went
on
and
on
till
it
reached
the
ears
of
the
great
seedeyman
the
mighty
we
of
the
country
as
he
sat
in
his
den
penning
his
for
his
it
had
then
distanced
the
great
itself
in
length
having
extended
over
miles
of
country
which
seedeyman
reported
to
have
been
run
in
one
hour
and
forty
minutes
pretty
good
going
we
should
say
chapter
x
the
feeler
bag
be
they
ever
so
good
are
but
unsatisfactory
things
drag
runs
are
beyond
all
measure
unsatisfactory
after
the
bag
there
is
always
a
sort
of
suppressed
joy
a
deadly
liveliness
in
the
field
those
in
the
secret
are
afraid
of
praising
it
too
much
lest
the
secret
should
ooze
out
and
strangers
suppose
that
all
their
great
runs
are
with
bag
foxes
while
the
mere
retaking
of
an
animal
that
one
has
had
in
hand
before
is
not
calculated
to
arouse
any
very
pleasurable
emotions
nobody
ever
goes
frantic
at
seeing
an
old
donkey
of
a
deer
handed
back
into
his
carriage
after
a
canter
our
friends
on
this
occasion
soon
exhausted
what
they
had
to
say
on
the
subject
a
nice
horse
of
yours
observed
waffles
to
sponge
as
the
latter
on
the
strength
of
the
musty
brush
now
rode
alongside
the
master
of
the
hounds
think
he
is
replied
sponge
rubbing
some
of
the
now
dried
sweat
from
his
shoulder
and
neck
think
he
is
i
like
him
a
good
deal
better
than
i
did
the
first
time
i
rode
him
he
a
new
one
is
he
asked
waffles
taking
a
scented
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
giving
a
steady
sidelong
stare
at
the
horse
him
in
leicestershire
replied
sponge
belonged
to
lord
bullfrog
who
did
think
him
exactly
up
to
his
weight
to
his
weight
exclaimed
caingey
thornton
who
had
now
ridden
up
on
the
other
side
of
his
great
patron
he
must
be
another
daniel
lambert
so
replied
sponge
nineteen
stun
a
monster
exclaimed
thornton
who
was
of
the
pocket
order
thought
he
did
go
fast
enough
at
his
fences
the
first
time
i
rode
him
observed
sponge
drawing
the
curb
slightly
so
as
to
show
the
horse
fine
arched
neck
to
advantage
he
went
quick
enough
in
all
conscience
added
he
did
observed
thornton
now
bent
on
a
toadying
match
never
saw
a
finer
lepper
flew
many
feet
beyond
the
brook
observed
spareneck
who
thinking
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valour
had
pulled
up
on
seeing
his
comrade
thornton
blobbing
about
in
the
middle
of
it
and
therefore
was
qualified
to
speak
to
the
fact
so
they
went
on
talking
about
the
horse
and
his
points
and
his
speed
and
his
action
very
likely
as
much
for
want
of
something
to
say
or
to
keep
off
the
subject
of
the
run
as
from
any
real
admiration
of
the
animal
the
true
way
to
make
a
man
take
a
fancy
to
a
horse
is
to
make
believe
that
you
do
want
to
sell
him
at
all
events
that
you
are
easy
about
selling
sponge
had
played
this
game
so
very
often
that
it
came
quite
natural
to
him
he
knew
exactly
how
far
to
go
and
having
expressed
his
previous
objection
to
the
horse
he
now
most
handsomely
made
the
by
patting
him
on
the
neck
and
declaring
that
he
really
thought
he
should
keep
him
it
is
said
that
every
man
has
his
weak
or
point
if
the
sharp
ones
can
but
discover
it
this
observation
does
not
refer
we
believe
to
men
with
an
innocent
for
play
or
the
turf
or
for
buying
pictures
or
for
collecting
china
or
for
driving
coaches
and
four
all
of
which
tastes
proclaim
themselves
sooner
or
later
but
means
that
the
most
knowing
the
most
cautious
and
the
most
careful
are
all
to
be
come
over
somehow
or
another
there
are
few
things
more
surprising
in
this
remarkable
world
than
the
magnificent
way
people
talk
about
money
or
the
meannesses
they
will
resort
to
in
order
to
get
a
little
we
hear
fellows
flashing
and
talking
in
hundreds
and
thousands
who
will
do
almost
anything
for
a
note
we
have
known
men
pretending
to
hunt
countries
at
their
own
expense
and
yet
actually
out
of
the
hounds
next
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
apparently
almost
impossible
feat
comes
the
dexterity
required
for
living
by
a
little
lower
down
in
the
scale
comes
the
income
derived
from
the
profession
of
a
the
gentleman
who
can
buy
the
horse
cheaper
than
you
can
this
was
caingey
thornton
trade
he
was
always
lurking
about
people
stables
talking
to
grooms
and
worming
out
secrets
whose
horse
had
a
cough
whose
was
a
whose
was
lame
after
hunting
and
so
on
and
had
a
price
current
of
every
horse
in
the
place
knew
what
had
been
given
what
the
owners
asked
and
had
a
pretty
good
guess
what
they
would
take
waffles
would
have
been
an
invaluable
customer
to
thornton
if
the
groom
figg
had
not
been
rather
too
hard
with
his
he
insisted
on
caingey
dividing
whatever
he
got
out
of
his
master
with
him
this
reduced
profits
considerably
but
still
as
it
was
a
profession
that
did
not
require
any
capital
to
set
up
with
thornton
could
afford
to
be
liberal
having
only
to
tack
on
to
one
end
to
cut
off
at
the
other
after
the
opening
sponge
gave
as
they
rode
home
with
the
hounds
thornton
had
no
difficulty
in
sounding
him
on
the
subject
not
think
me
impertinent
i
hope
observed
caingey
in
his
most
deferential
style
to
our
hero
when
they
met
at
the
the
next
day
not
think
me
impertinent
i
hope
but
i
think
you
said
as
we
rode
home
yesterday
that
you
did
altogether
like
the
brown
horse
you
were
on
i
replied
sponge
with
apparent
surprise
think
you
must
have
misunderstood
me
no
it
was
exactly
that
rejoined
thornton
you
said
you
liked
him
better
than
you
did
i
think
i
believe
i
did
say
something
of
the
sort
replied
sponge
casually
believe
i
did
say
something
of
the
sort
but
he
carried
me
so
well
that
i
thought
better
of
him
the
fact
was
continued
sponge
confidentially
thought
him
rather
too
light
mouthed
i
like
a
horse
that
bears
more
on
the
hand
observed
thornton
people
think
a
light
mouth
a
recommendation
know
they
do
replied
sponge
know
they
do
but
i
like
a
horse
that
requires
a
little
riding
now
this
is
too
much
of
a
made
horse
too
much
of
what
i
call
an
old
man
horse
for
me
bullfrog
whom
i
bought
him
of
is
very
fat
eats
a
great
deal
of
venison
and
turtle
all
sorts
of
good
things
in
fact
and
ca
stand
much
tewing
in
the
saddle
now
i
rather
like
to
feel
that
i
am
on
a
horse
and
not
in
an
a
fine
horse
observed
thornton
he
ought
replied
sponge
gave
a
hatful
of
money
for
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
golden
sovereigns
and
not
a
guinea
back
bullfrog
the
biggest
screw
i
ever
dealt
with
that
latter
observation
was
highly
encouraging
to
thornton
it
showed
that
sponge
was
not
one
of
your
dons
who
take
offence
at
the
mere
mention
of
but
on
the
contrary
favoured
the
supposition
that
he
would
do
the
should
he
happen
to
be
a
seller
if
you
should
feel
disposed
to
part
with
him
perhaps
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
let
me
know
observed
thornton
adding
not
for
myself
of
course
but
i
think
i
know
a
man
he
would
suit
and
who
would
be
inclined
to
give
a
good
price
for
him
will
replied
sponge
will
repeated
he
adding
i
to
sell
him
i
would
take
a
farthing
under
three
for
him
three
mind
a
vast
sum
of
money
observed
thornton
a
bit
o
replied
sponge
worth
it
all
and
a
great
deal
more
indeed
i
have
said
mind
that
i
take
that
for
him
all
said
is
that
i
would
take
less
so
replied
thornton
a
horse
of
high
character
observed
sponge
he
has
no
business
out
of
leicestershire
and
i
do
know
what
set
my
fool
of
a
groom
to
bring
him
here
i
see
if
i
can
coax
my
friend
into
giving
what
you
say
observed
thornton
never
mind
coaxing
replied
sponge
with
the
utmost
indifference
mind
coaxing
if
he
not
anxious
my
name
easy
only
mind
ye
if
i
ride
him
again
and
he
carries
me
as
he
did
yesterday
i
shall
clap
on
another
fifty
a
horse
of
that
figure
ca
be
dear
at
any
price
added
he
him
in
a
and
you
get
your
money
back
in
ten
minutes
and
a
bagful
to
boot
observed
thornton
treasuring
that
fact
up
as
an
additional
inducement
to
use
to
his
friend
so
the
amiable
gentlemen
parted
chapter
xi
the
deal
and
the
disaster
if
people
are
inclined
to
deal
bargains
can
very
soon
be
struck
at
idle
where
anything
in
the
shape
of
occupation
is
a
godsend
and
bargainers
know
where
to
find
each
other
in
a
minute
everybody
knows
where
everybody
is
you
seen
jack
sprat
yes
he
just
gone
into
muddle
bazaar
with
miss
flouncey
looking
uncommon
sweet
or
you
tell
me
where
i
shall
find
mr
slowman
find
him
at
his
lodgings
no
belvidere
terrace
till
a
quarter
before
seven
he
gone
home
to
dress
to
dine
with
major
and
holdsworthy
at
grunton
villa
for
i
heard
him
order
jenkins
fly
at
that
time
caingey
thornton
knew
exactly
when
he
would
find
waffles
at
miss
lollypop
the
confectioner
eating
ices
and
making
love
to
that
very
interesting
young
lady
true
to
his
time
there
was
waffles
eating
and
eyeing
the
ribbons
floating
in
graceful
curls
along
with
her
ringlets
down
miss
lollypop
nice
fresh
plump
cheeks
after
expatiating
on
the
great
merits
of
the
horse
and
the
certainty
of
getting
all
the
money
back
by
him
in
the
spring
and
stating
his
conviction
that
sponge
would
not
take
any
part
of
the
in
pictures
or
jewellery
or
anything
of
that
sort
waffles
gave
his
consent
to
deal
on
the
terms
the
following
conversation
shows
friend
will
give
you
your
price
if
you
would
mind
taking
his
cheque
and
keeping
it
for
a
few
months
till
he
into
funds
observed
thornton
who
now
sought
sponge
out
at
the
observed
sponge
thoughtfully
know
horses
are
always
ready
money
replied
thornton
least
that
the
theory
of
the
thing
only
my
friend
is
rather
peculiarly
situated
at
present
suppose
waffles
is
your
man
observed
sponge
rightly
judging
that
there
could
be
two
such
flats
in
the
place
so
said
thornton
illustration
waffles
at
miss
lollypop
rather
take
his
stiff
than
his
cheque
observed
sponge
after
a
pause
could
get
a
bit
of
stiff
but
a
cheque
you
see
especially
a
one
is
always
objected
to
i
dare
say
that
will
make
no
difference
observed
thornton
stiff
if
you
prefer
it
say
three
months
or
perhaps
you
give
us
four
long
enough
in
all
conscience
replied
sponge
with
a
shake
of
the
head
adding
made
me
pay
down
on
the
nail
so
be
it
then
assented
thornton
draw
at
three
months
and
waffles
will
accept
payable
at
coutts
after
so
much
liberality
caingey
expected
that
sponge
would
have
hinted
at
something
handsome
for
him
but
all
sponge
said
was
be
it
too
as
he
walked
away
to
buy
a
waffles
was
more
considerate
and
promised
him
the
first
mount
on
his
new
purchase
though
caingey
would
rather
have
had
a
ten
or
even
a
note
towards
the
hour
of
ten
on
that
eventful
day
numerous
gaitered
trousered
and
jacketed
grooms
began
to
ride
up
and
down
the
high
street
most
of
them
with
their
stirrups
crossed
negligently
on
the
pommels
of
the
saddles
to
indicate
that
their
masters
were
going
to
ride
the
horses
and
not
them
the
street
grew
lively
not
so
much
with
people
going
to
hunt
as
with
people
coming
to
see
those
who
were
tattered
hibernians
with
rags
on
their
backs
and
jokes
on
their
lips
young
english
with
their
hands
ready
to
dive
into

pockets
but
their
own
stablemen
out
of

loitering
on
their
errands

helping
them
with

of

hung
over
the

after

before
mounting

asked
caingey
thornton
who
now
appeared
wiping
his
fat
lips
after
his
second
glass
of
de
sponge
replied
spareneck
in
a
low
tone
knowing
how
soon
a
man
catches
his
own
name
deuced
fine

he
is
too
observed
caingey
in
a
louder
key
adding
has
the
finest
lot
of
horses
of
any
man
in
england
in
the
world
i
may
say
sponge
himself
now
rose
from
the
breakfast
table
and
was
speedily
followed
by
waffles
and
the
rest
of
the
party
some
bearing
and
cushions
to
place
on
the
balustrades
to
loll
at
their
ease
in
imitation
of
the
coventry
club
swells
in
piccadilly
then
our
friends
smoked
their
cigars
reviewed
the

and
criticised
the

on
their
way
to

exclaimed
one
miss
bussington
coming
to
look
after
you
got
her
mamma
with
her
too
so
you
may
as
well
knock
under
at
once
for
she
determined
to
have
you
devil
of
a
woman
the
old
un
is
too
observed
ensign
downley
nearly
frightened
jack
simpers
of
ours
into
fits
by
asking
what
he
meant
after
dancing
three
dances
with
her
daughter
one
night
word
but
miss
jumpheavy
must
expect
to
do
some
execution
with
that
fine
floating
feather
and
her
crimson
satin
dress
and
ermine
observed
waffles
as
that
estimable
lady
drove
past
in
her

looks
like
the
queen

but
come
i
suppose
he
added
taking
a
most
diminutive
geneva
watch
out
of
his
should
be
going
see
there
your
nag
kicking
up
a
shindy
he
said
to
caingey
thornton
as
the
redoubtable
brown
was
led
down
the
street
by
a
groom
kicking
and
lashing
out
at
everything
he
came
near
kick
him
observed
thornton
retiring
from
the
balcony
to
the
and
helping
himself
to
a
pretty
glass
he
then
extricated
his
large
cutting
whip
from
the
confusion
of
whips
with
which
it
was
mixed
and
clonk
clonk
clonked
downstairs
to
the
door
in
parvo
stopped
the
doorway
across
whose
shoulder
leather
passed
the
following
hints
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
to
sponge
as
the
latter
stood
drawing
on
his
dogskin
gloves
the
observed
as
he
flattered
himself
of
all
observers
now
said
leather
oss
as
a
will
of
his
own
though
he
seems
so
quiet
like
he
not
always
to
be
depended
on
so
be
on
the
for
squalls
sponge
having
had
a
glass
of
brandy
just
mounted
with
the
air
of
a
man
thoroughly
at
home
with
his
horse
and
drawing
the
rein
with
a
slight
feel
of
the
spur
passed
on
from
the
door
to
make
way
for
the
redoubtable
hercules
hercules
was
evidently
not
in
a
good
humour
his
ears
were
laid
back
and
the
rolling
white
eye
showed
mischief
sponge
saw
all
this
and
turned
to
see
whether
thornton
clumsy
seat
would
be
able
to
control
the
fractious
spirit
of
the
horse
roared
thornton
as
his
first
dive
at
the
stirrup
missed
and
was
answered
by
a
hearty
kick
out
from
the
horse
the
being
given
in
a
very
different
tone
to
the
gentle
coaxing
style
of
buckram
and
his
men
had
it
not
been
for
the
brandy
within
and
the
without
there
is
no
saying
but
caingey
would
have
declined
the
horse
further
acquaintance
as
it
was
he
quickly
repeated
his
attempt
at
the
stirrup
with
the
same
sort
of
domineering
adding
as
he
landed
in
the
saddle
and
snatched
at
the
reins
you
think
i
stole
you
whatever
the
horse
opinion
might
be
on
that
point
he
did
seem
to
care
to
express
it
for
finding
kicking
alone
would
do
he
immediately
commenced
rearing
too
and
by
a
desperate
plunge
broke
away
from
the
groom
before
thornton
had
either
got
him
by
the
head
or
his
feet
in
the
stirrups
three
most
desperate
bounds
he
gave
rising
at
the
bit
as
though
he
would
come
back
over
if
the
hold
was
not
relaxed
and
the
fourth
effort
bringing
him
to
the
opposite
he
up
again
with
such
a
bound
and
impetus
that
he
crashed
right
through
frippery
and
flummery
fine
window
to
the
terror
and
astonishment
of
their
elegant
young
who
were
busy
arranging
their
ribbons
and
finery
for
the
day
right
through
the
window
hercules
went
switching
through
book
muslins
and
barèges
as
he
would
through
a
bullfinch
and
attempting
to
make
his
exit
by
a
large
mirror
against
the
wall
of
the
beyond
which
he
dashed
all
to
pieces
with
his
head
worse
remains
to
be
told
in
parvo
seeing
his
old
comrade
disappearing
through
the
window
just
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
followed
in
spite
of
sponge
every
effort
to
turn
him
and
when
at
length
he
got
him
hauled
round
the
horse
was
found
to
have
decorated
himself
with
a
trimmed
with
honiton
lace
which
he
wore
like
a
charger
on
his
way
to
the
crusades
or
a
steed
bearing
a
knight
to
the
eglinton
tournament
quick
as
it
happened
and
soon
as
it
was
over
all
laverick
wells
seemed
to
have
congregated
in
the
street
as
our
heroes
rode
out
of
the
folding

chapter
xii
an
old
friend
about
a
fortnight
after
the
above
catastrophe
and
as
the
recollection
of
it
was
nearly
effaced
by
miss
jumpheavy
abduction
of
ensign
downley
our
friend
waffles
on
visiting
his
stud
at
the
four
found
a
most
respectable
man
straddling
his
tight
legs
with
a
twisted
ash
plant
propping
his
chin
behind
the
redoubtable
hercules
he
had
a
hat
on
a
blue
coat
with
metal
buttons
that
anywhere
but
in
the
searching
glare
and
contrast
of
london
might
have
passed
for
a
new
one
a
small
striped
toilanette
vest
and
the
aforesaid
drab
trousers
in
the
pocket
of
which
his
disengaged
hand
kept
fishing
up
and
slipping
down
an
avalanche
of
silver
which
made
a
pleasant
musical
accompaniment
to
his
monetary
conversation
on
seeing
waffles
the
stranger
touched
his
hat
and
appeared
to
be
about
to
retire
when
figg
the
thus
addressed
his
master
be
buckram
sir
of

says
he

replied
waffles
the
now
began
to
descend
singly
in
the
pocket
keeping
up
a
protracted
jingle
like
the
notes
of
a
lazy
undecided
musical
by
the
time
the
last
had
dropped
buckram
had
collected
himself
sufficiently
to
resume
taking
the
away
from
his
mouth

barricading
his
lips

for
some
time
with
the
aldermen
o
bristol
and
has
thrown
up
a
vast
bad
flesh
two
stun
sin
last
season
and
he
afeared
this
oss
wo
be
able
to
carry
and
so
he
writ
to
me
to
take

to
show
he
carry
i
think
said
sponge
making
hup
his
mind
on
the
moment
jist
as
he
makes
hup
his
mind
to
ride
at
a
fence
not
that
i
think
it
a
good
plan
for
a
gent
to
show
that
he
sweet
on
an
oss
for
they
sure
to
make
him
pay
for
it
howsomever
that
nouther
here
nor
there
well
jist
as

said
this
sir
richard
driv
hup
and
havin
got
his
oss
away
we
trotted
to
the
goss
jist
below
and
the
next
thing
i
see
was
sponge
leadin
the
field
on
this
werry
nag
well
i
heard
no
more
till
i
got
to
melton
for
i
did
go
to
my
at
mount
sorrel
that
night
and
i
saw
little
of
the
run
for
my
oss
was
rather
puffy
livin
principally
on
chaff
bran
mashes
swedes
and
soft
food
and
when
i
got
to
melton
i
heard
sponge
had
bought
this
oss
buckram
nodding
his
head
at
the
horse
as
he
spoke
that
he
given
the
matter
o
two
or
i
not
sure
it
were
two
guineas
for
and
interrupted
waffles
tired
of
his
verbosity
what
did
they
say
about
the
horse
continued
buckram
thoughtfully
propping
his
chin
up
with
his
stick
and
drawing
all
the
up
to
the
top
of
his
pocket
again
fust
thing
i
heard
was
sir
digby
snaffle
grum
sam
to
captain
screwley
grum
jist
afore
the
george
inn
door
well
jack
tommy
sold

exclaimed
jack
starin
eyes
out
as
if
it
were
unpossible
he
though
said
sam
well
then
i
the
gemman
fond
o
walkin
exclaimed
jack
out
a
laughin
and
runnin
on
rayther
set
me
a
thinkin
continued
buckram
dropping
a
second
which
jinked
against
the
one
left
at
the
bottom
fearin
that
sponge
had
fallen
the
philistines
which
i
was
werry
concerned
about
for
he
a
real
nice
gent
but
thoughtless
as
many
young
gents
are
who
plenty
of
tin
i
made
it
my
business
to
inquire
this
oss
and
if
he
the
oss
that
i
saw
in
leicestersheer
and
i
little
doubt
about
it
dropping
two
consecutive
as
he
spoke
though
i
not
seen
him
out
i
well
i
bought
him
of
sponge
who
said
he
got
him
from
lord
bullfrog
interrupted
waffles
then
he
the
oss
in
course
said
buckram
with
a
sort
of
mournful
chuck
of
the
chin
the
oss
repeated
he
then
he
a
dangerous
hanimal
added
he
letting
slip
three
does
he
do
asked
waffles
repeated
buckram
he
do
for
anybody
responded
waffles
adding
could
sponge
sell
me
such
a
brute
does
mean
to
say
mind
ye
observed
buckram
drawing
back
three
as
though
he
had
gone
that
much
too
far
does
mean
to
say
mind
that
he
wot
you
call
a
misteched
runaway
but
i
mean
to
say
he
a
difficultish
oss
to
ride
himpetuous
and
one
that
if
he
got
the
hupper
would
be
werry
likely
to
try
and
keep
the
hupper
you
understand
me
said
he
eyeing
waffles
intently
and
dropping
four
as
he
spoke
tellin
you
nothin
but
the
truth
observed
buckram
after
a
pause
adding
course
it
nothin
to
me
only
bein
down
here
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
and
that
the
oss
were
i
made
bold
to
look
in
to
see
whether
it
was
or
no
no
offence
i
added
he
letting
go
the
rest
of
the
silver
and
taking
the
prop
from
under
his
chin
with
an
obeisance
as
if
he
was
about
to
be
off
no
offence
at
all
rejoined
waffles
offence
rather
the
contrary
indeed
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
what
you
have
done
just
stop
half
a
minute
added
he
thinking
he
might
as
well
try
and
get
something
more
out
of
him
while
waffles
was
considering
his
next
question
buckram
saved
him
the
trouble
of
thinking
by
the
gallop
himself
believe
to
be
a
oss
and
i
believe
to
be
a
oss
observed
buckram
sententiously
believe
that
oss
with
a
bold
rider
on
his
back
and
well
away
with
the
would
beat
most
osses
goin
but
it
the
start
that
the
difficulty
with
him
for
if
on
the
other
he
do
incline
to
go
all
the
spurrin
and
quiltin
and
leatherin
in
the
world
wo
make
it
be
a
mercy
o
providence
if
he
do
cut
out
work
for
the
crowner
some
day
the
brute
exclaimed
waffles
in
disgust
a
good
mind
to
have
his
throat
cut
replied
buckram
brightening
up
and
stirring
the
silver
round
and
round
in
his
pocket
like
a
whirlpool
replied
he
fit
for
summat
better
nor
that
much
i
think
replied
waffles
pouting
with
disgust
he
now
stood
silent
for
a
few
seconds
but
what
did
they
mean
by
hoping
sponge
was
fond
of
walking
at
length
asked
he
vy
replied
buckram
gathering
all
the
money
up
again
believe
it
was
this
beginning
to
drop
them
to
time
and
talking
very
slowly
oss
i
believe
got
the
better
of
lord
bullfrog
one
day
somewhere
a
little
on
this
side
of
thrussinton
that
you
know
is
where
sir
built
his
kennels
between
mount
sorrel
and
melton
in
fact
and
havin
got
his
lordship
off
who
i
should
tell
you
is
an
uncommon
fat
he
would
let
him
on
again
and
he
to
lead
him
the
matter
of
i
do
know
many
miles
buckram
letting
go
the
whole
balance
of
silver
in
a
rush
as
if
to
denote
that
it
was
no
joke
brute
observed
waffles
in
disgust
adding
as
you
seem
to
have
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
him
suppose
you
buy
him
i
let
you
have
him
cheap
bless
you
my
lord
that
to
say
sir
exclaimed
buckram
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
and
raising
his
eyebrows
as
high
as
they
would
go
be
of
no
use
to
me
none
votsomever
should
know
what
to
do
with
him
never
do
for
besides
i
a
werry
good
machiner
as
it
is
at
least
he
sarves
my
turn
and
that
everything
you
know
no
sir
no
continued
he
slowly
and
thoughtfully
dropping
the
silver
to
time
sir
no
if
i
might
make
free
with
a
your
helegance
continued
he
after
a
pause
i
say
sell
to
a
or
a
or
some
sich
cattle
as
those
but
i
think
i
put
into
the
of
no
that
to
say
if
i
were
at
least
added
he
then
will
you
speculate
on
him
yourself
for
the
asked
waffles
tired
alike
of
the
colloquy
and
the
quadruped
illustration
portrait
of
lord
bullfrog
formerly
owner
of
vy
as
to
that
replied
buckram
with
an
air
of
the
most
perfect
indifference
as
to
that
not
bein
nouther
a
nor
a
but
as
i
said
before
a
little
hindependence
o
my
own
vy
i
could
in
course
give
such
a
bountiful
price
as
if
i
could
turn
to
account
at
once
but
if
it
would
be
any
to
you
added
he
working
the
silver
up
into
full
cry
would
mind
givin
you
the
with
worth
of
say
deductin
expenses
hup
to
town
and
at
livery
afore
i
finds
a
customer
expenses
hup
to
town
continued
buckram
muttering
to
himself
in
apparent
calculation
at
livery
a
night
grum
and
so
on
i
would
mind
continued
he
briskly
of
you
twenty
pund
for
if
you
throw
me
back
a
continued
he
seeing
waffles
brow
did
contract
into
the
frown
he
expected
at
having
such
a
sum
offered
for
his
horse
in
the
course
of
an
hour
that
wonderful
invention
of
modern
times
the
electric
telegraph
conveyed
the
satisfactory
words
right
to
our
friend
sponge
just
as
he
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
in
a
certain
sumptuously
sanded
in
conduit
street
who
forthwith
sealed
and
posted
the
following
letter
hotel
bond
street
have
been
greatly
surprised
and
hurt
to
hear
that
you
have
thought
fit
to
impeach
my
integrity
and
insinuate
that
i
had
taken
you
in
with
the
brown
horse
such
insinuations
touch
one
in
a
tender
point
the
bargain
i
may
remind
you
was
of
your
own
seeking
and
i
told
you
at
the
time
i
knew
nothing
of
the
horse
having
only
ridden
him
once
and
i
also
told
you
where
i
got
him
to
show
how
unjust
and
unworthy
your
insinuations
have
been
i
have
now
to
inform
you
that
having
ascertained
that
lord
bullfrog
knew
he
was
vicious
i
insisted
on
his
lordship
taking
him
back
and
have
only
to
add
that
on
my
receiving
him
from
you
i
will
return
you
your
bill

sir

obedient

waffles
was
a
good
deal
vexed
and
puzzled
when
he
got
this
letter
he
had
parted
with
the
horse
who
was
gone
no
one
knew
where
and
waffles
felt
that
he
had
used
a
certain
freedom
of
speech
in
speaking
of
the
transaction
sponge
having
left
laverick
wells
had
perhaps
led
him
a
little
astray
with
his
tongue
slandering
an
absent
man
being
generally
thought
a
pretty
safe
game
it
now
seemed
waffles
was
all
wrong
and
might
have
had
his
money
back
if
he
had
not
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
part
with
the
horse
like
a
good
many
people
he
thought
he
had
best
eat
up
his
words
which
he
did
in
the
following
manner
hotel
laverick
wells
sponge
are
quite
mistaken
in
supposing
that
i
ever
insinuated
anything
against
with
regard
to
the
horse
i
said
was
a
beast
and
it
seems
lord
bullfrog
admits
it
however
never
mind
anything
more
about
him
though
i
am
equally
obliged
to
you
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
the
fact
is
i
have
parted
with
him
are
having
capital
sport
never
go
out
but
we
kill
sometimes
a
brace
sometimes
a
leash
of
foxes
hoping
you
are
recovered
from
the
effects
of
your
ride
through
the
window
and
will
soon
rejoin
us
believe
me
dear
sponge
very
sincerely

to
which
sponge
shortly
after
rejoined

i
am
glad
to
receive
a
disclaimer
of
any
unworthy
imputations
respecting
the
brown
horse
such
insinuations
are
only
for
not
for
men
of
high
gentlemanly
feeling
am
sorry
to
say
we
have
not
got
out
of
the
horse
as
i
hoped
lord
bullfrog
who
is
a
most
cantankerous
fellow
insists
upon
having
him
back
according
to
the
terms
of
my
letter
i
must
therefore
trouble
you
to
hunt
him
up
and
let
us
accommodate
his
lordship
with
him
again
if
you
will
say
where
he
is
i
may
very
likely
know
some
one
who
can
assist
us
in
getting
him
you
will
excuse
this
trouble
i
hope
considering
that
it
was
to
serve
you
that
i
moved
in
the
matter
and
insisted
on
returning
him
to
his
lordship

did
put

successfully

the

by
not
being
able
to

a

could
only
be
salved
that
way
gradually
however
we
diverged
from

a

to

the
upshot
of
it
is
that
he
will
advise
his
lordship
to
take
and
be
done
with
it
it
a
bore
but
i
did
it
for
the

it

quivering
to

a
few

expressive
of

our

had
taken

that
it

not

overjoyed
it

he
spend

half
a

go

no

it

our

now
in
good

he
had
got
a
large
price
for
his
horse
with
a
very
handsome
bonus
for
not
getting
him
back
making
him
better
off
than
he
had
been
for
some
time
gentlemen
of
his
calibre
are
generally
extremely
affluent
in
everything

cash
they
have
bills
without

nobody

such
utter
disregard

it
would
puzzle
an
accountant
to
comb
them
into
anything
like
shape
it
is
true
what
sponge
got
from

were
bills
but
they
were
good
bills

of
such
reasonable

just
got
from

now
was
where

cheery
sort
of
fellow
who
was
always
delighted
to
see
you
would
start
at
the
view
and
stand
with
open
arms
in
the
middle
of
the
street
as
though
quite
overjoyed
at
the
meeting
though
he
never
gave
dinners
nor
anything
where
he
was
he
asked
everybody
at
least
everybody
who
did
give
them
to
visit
him
at
jawleyford
court
if
a
man
was
fond
of
fishing
he
must
come
to
jawleyford
court
he
must
indeed
he
would
take
no
refusal
he
would
leave
him
alone
till
he
promised
he
would
show
him
such
fishing
no
waters
in
the
world
to
compare
with
his
the
shannon
and
the
tweed
were
not
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
same
day
as
his
waters
in
the
swiftley
shooting
the
same
way
jove
are
you
a
shooter
well
i
delighted
to
hear
it
well
now
we
shall
be
at
home
all
september
and
up
to
the
middle
of
october
and
you
must
just
come
to
us
at
your
own
time
and
i
will
give
you
some
of
the
finest
partridge
and
pheasant
shooting
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
norfolk
can
show
nothing
to
what
i
can
now
my
good
fellow
say
the
word
say
you
come
and
then
it
will
be
a
settled
thing
and
i
shall
look
forward
to
it
with
such
pleasure
he
was
equally
magnanimous
about
hunting
though
like
a
good
many
people
who
have
their
hunts
he
pretended
that
his
day
was
over
though
he
was
a
most
zealous
promoter
of
the
sport
so
he
asked
everybody
who
did
hunt
to
come
and
see
him
and
what
with
his
hearty
affable
manner
and
the
unlimited
nature
of
his
invitations
he
generally
passed
for
a
deuced
hospitable
good
sort
of
fellow
and
came
in
for
no
end
of
dinners
and
other
entertainments
for
his
wife
and
daughters
of
which
he
had
two
daughters
we
mean
not
wives
his
time
was
about
up
at
laverick
wells
when
sponge
arrived
there
nevertheless
during
the
few
days
that
remained
to
them
jawleyford
contrived
to
scrape
a
pretty
intimate
acquaintance
with
a
gentleman
whose
wealth
was
reported
to
equal
if
it
did
not
exceed
that
of
waffles
himself
the
following
was
the
closing
scene
between
them
illustration
jawleyford
of
jawleyford
court
sponge
said
he
getting
our
hero
by
both
hands
in
billiard
room
and
shaking
them
as
though
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
separation
dear
sponge
added
he
grieve
to
say
we
going
i
had
hoped
to
have
stayed
a
little
longer
and
to
have
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
your
most
agreeable
society
this
was
true
he
would
have
stayed
only
his
banker
would
let
him
have
any
more
money
however
i
wo
say
adieu
continued
he
i
say
adieu
i
live
as
you
perhaps
know
in
one
of
the
best
hunting
countries
in
england
my
lord
scamperdale
scamperdale
and
i
are
like
brothers
i
can
do
whatever
i
like
with
him
he
has
i
may
say
the
finest
pack
of
hounds
in
the
world
his
huntsman
jack
frostyface
i
really
believe
can
not
be
surpassed
come
then
my
dear
fellow
continued
jawleyford
increasing
the
grasp
and
shake
of
the
hands
and
looking
most
earnestly
in
sponge
face
as
if
deprecating
a
refusal
then
my
dear
fellow
and
see
us
we
will
do
whatever
we
can
to
entertain
and
make
you
comfortable
scamperdale
shall
keep
our
side
of
the
country
till
you
come
there
are
capital
stables
at
lucksford
close
to
the
station
and
you
shall
have
a
stall
for
your
hack
at
jawleyford
and
a
man
to
look
after
him
if
you
like
so
now
do
say
nay
your
time
shall
be
ours
we
shall
be
at
home
all
the
rest
of
the
winter
and
i
flatter
myself
if
you
once
come
down
you
will
be
inclined
to
repeat
your
visit
at
least
i
hope
so
there
are
two
common
sayings
one
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
the
other
two
of
a
trade
never
agree
which
often
seem
to
us
to
contradict
each
other
in
the
actual
intercourse
of
life
humbugs
certainly
have
the
knack
of
drawing
together
and
yet
they
are
always
excellent
friends
and
will
vouch
for
the
goodness
of
each
other
in
a
way
that
few
men
think
it
worth
their
while
to
adopt
with
regard
to
indifferent
people
indeed
humbugs
are
not
always
content
to
defend
their
absent
brother
humbugs
when
they
hear
them
abused
but
they
will
frequently
lug
each
other
in
neck
and
crop
apparently
for
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
proclaiming
what
excellent
fellows
they
are
and
see
if
anybody
will
take
up
the
cudgels
against
them
sponge
albeit
with
a
considerable
cross
of
the
humbug
himself
and
one
who
perfectly
understood
the
usual
worthlessness
of
general
invitations
was
yet
so
taken
with
jawleyford
earnest
sort
of
manner
that
adopting
the
convenient
and
familiar
solution
in
such
matters
that
there
is
no
rule
without
an
exception
concluded
that
jawleyford
was
the
exception
and
really
meant
what
he
said
independently
of
the
attractions
offered
by
hunting
which
were
both
strong
and
cogent
we
have
said
there
were
two
young
ladies
to
whom
fame
attached
the
enormous
fortunes
common
in
cases
where
there
is
a
large
property
and
no
sons
still
sponge
was
a
wary
bird
and
his
experience
of
the
worthlessness
of
most
general
invitations
made
him
think
it
just
possible
that
it
might
not
suit
jawleyford
to
receive
him
now
at
the
particular
time
he
wanted
to
go
so
after
duly
considering
the
case
and
also
the
impressive
nature
of
the
invitation
so
recently
given
too
he
determined
not
to
give
jawleyford
the
chance
of
refusing
him
but
just
to
say
he
was
coming
and
drop
down
upon
him
before
he
could
say
accordingly
he
penned
the
following
epistle
hotel
london
jawleyford
purpose
being
with
you
by
the
express
train
which
i
see
by
bradshaw
arrives
at
lucksford
a
quarter
to
three
i
shall
only
bring
two
hunters
and
a
hack
so
perhaps
you
could
oblige
me
by
taking
them
in
for
the
short
time
i
shall
stay
as
it
would
not
be
convenient
for
me
to
separate
them
hoping
to
find
jawleyford
and
the
young
ladies
well
i
remain
dear
sir
very
truly
sponge
jawleyford
jawleyford
court
lucksford
the
fellow
exclaimed
jawleyford
nearly
choking
himself
with
a
fish
bone
as
he
opened
and
read
the
foregoing
at
breakfast
the
fellow
he
repeated
stamping
the
letter
under
foot
as
though
he
would
crush
it
to
atoms
ever
saw
such
a
piece
of
impudence
as
that
the
matter
my
dear
inquired
jawleyford
alarmed
lest
it
was
her
dunning
jeweller
writing
again
shrieked
jawleyford
in
a
tone
that
sounded
through
the
thick
wall
of
the
room
and
caused
the
hobbling
old
gardener
on
the
terrace
to
peep
in
at
the
window
repeated
he
as
though
he
had
got
his
de
there
added
he
handing
over
the
letter
my
dear
rejoined
jawleyford
soothingly
as
soon
as
she
saw
it
was
not
what
she
expected
my
dear
i
sure
there
nothing
to
make
you
put
yourself
so
much
out
of
the
way
roared
jawleyford
determined
not
to
be
done
out
of
his
grievance
repeated
he
you
call
that
nothing
nothing
to
make
yourself
unhappy
about
replied
jawleyford
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
for
she
was
glad
it
was
not
from
rings
the
jeweller
and
moreover
hated
the
monotony
of
jawleyford
court
and
was
glad
of
anything
to
relieve
it
if
she
had
had
her
own
way
she
would
have
gadded
about
at
all
the
year
round
said
jawleyford
with
a
toss
of
the
head
and
a
shrug
of
resignation
have
me
in
gaol
i
see
that
my
dear
rejoined
his
wife
soothingly
sure
you
plenty
of
money
i
ejaculated
jawleyford
you
suppose
if
i
had
i
have
left
laverick
wells
without
paying
miss
bustlebey
or
given
a
bill
at
three
months
for
the
but
my
dear
you
nothing
to
do
but
tell
screwemtight
to
get
you
some
money
from
the
tenants
from
the
tenants
replied
jawleyford
tells
me
he
ca
get
another
farthing
from
any
man
on
the
estate
pooh
said
jawleyford
far
too
good
to
them
i
always
say
screwemtight
looks
far
more
to
their
interest
than
he
does
to
yours
illustration
jawleyford
we
may
observe
was
one
of
the
rather
numerous
race
of
landowners
he
always
dressed
in
the
country
as
he
would
in
james
street
and
his
communications
with
his
tenantry
were
chiefly
confined
to
dining
with
them
twice
a
year
in
the
great
after
screwemtight
had
eased
them
of
their
cash
in
the
steward
room
then
jawleyford
would
shine
forth
the
very
impersonification
of
what
a
landlord
ought
to
be
dressed
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
as
if
by
his
clothes
to
give
the
lie
to
his
words
he
would
expatiate
on
the
delights
of
such
meetings
of
equality
declare
that
next
to
those
spent
with
his
family
the
only
really
happy
moments
of
his
life
were
those
when
he
was
surrounded
by
his
tenantry
he
doated
on
the
manly
character
of
the
english
farmer
then
he
would
advert
to
the
great
antiquity
of
the
jawleyford
family
many
generations
of
whom
looked
down
upon
them
from
the
walls
of
the
old
hall
some
on
their
some
armed
some
in
some
in
spanish
ones
one
in
a
white
dress
with
gold
brocade
breeches
and
a
hat
with
an
enormous
plume
old
jawleyford
father
of
the
present
one
in
the
windsor
uniform
and
our
friend
himself
the
very
prototype
of
what
then
stood
before
them
indeed
he
had
been
painted
in
the
act
of
addressing
his
hereditary
chawbacons
in
the
hall
in
which
the
picture
was
suspended
there
he
stood
with
his
bright
auburn
hair
now
rather
perhaps
but
still
very
passable
by
candlelight
his
bright
auburn
hair
we
say
swept
boldly
off
his
lofty
forehead
his
hazy
grey
eyes
flashing
with
the
excitement
of
drink
and
animation
his
left
hand
reposing
on
the
hip
of
his
black
pantaloons
while
the
right
one
radiant
with
rings
and
trimmed
with
upturned
wristband
sawed
the
air
as
he
rounded
off
the
periods
of
the
saws
jawleyford
like
a
good
many
people
was
very
hospitable
when
in
full
fig
two
soups
two
fishes
and
the
necessary
concomitants
but
he
would
see
any
one
far
enough
before
he
would
give
him
a
dinner
merely
because
he
wanted
one
that
sort
of
ostentatious
banqueting
has
about
brought
country
society
in
general
to
a
deadlock
people
tire
of
the
constant
revision
of
plate
linen
and
china
jawleyford
on
the
other
hand
was
a
very
sort
of
woman
never
put
out
of
her
way
and
though
she
constantly
preached
the
old
doctrine
that
girls
much
better
single
than
married
she
was
always
on
the
for
opportunities
of
contradicting
her
assertions
she
was
an
irish
lady
with
a
pedigree
almost
as
long
as
jawleyford
but
more
compressible
pride
and
if
she
could
get
a
duke
she
would
take
a
marquis
or
an
earl
or
even
put
up
with
a
rich
commoner
the
perusal
therefore
of
sponge
letter
operated
differently
upon
her
to
what
it
did
upon
her
husband
and
though
she
would
have
liked
a
little
more
time
perhaps
she
did
not
care
to
take
him
as
they
were
jawleyford
however
resisted
violently
it
would
be
most
particularly
inconvenient
to
him
to
receive
company
at
that
time
if
sponge
had
gone
through
the
whole
three
hundred
and
days
in
the
year
he
could
not
have
hit
upon
a
more
inconvenient
one
for
him
besides
he
had
no
idea
of
people
writing
in
that
sort
of
a
way
saying
they
were
coming
without
giving
him
the
chance
of
saying
no
but
my
dear
i
dare
say
you
asked
him
observed
jawleyford
jawleyford
was
silent
the
scene
in
the
recurring
to
his
mind
often
told
you
my
dear
continued
jawleyford
kindly
you
should
be
so
free
with
your
invitations
if
you
do
want
people
to
come
things
are
very
different
now
to
what
they
were
in
the
old
coaching
and
posting
days
when
it
took
a
day
and
a
night
and
half
the
next
day
to
get
here
and
i
do
know
how
much
money
besides
you
might
then
invite
people
with
safety
but
it
is
very
different
now
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
put
themselves
into
the
express
train
and
whisk
down
in
a
few
hours
but
confound
him
i
did
ask
his
horses
exclaimed
jawleyford
will
i
have
them
either
continued
he
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
as
he
got
up
and
rang
the
bell
as
though
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
that
at
all
events
said
he
to
the
dirty
page
of
a
boy
who
answered
the
summons
john
watson
to
go
down
to
the
railway
tavern
directly
and
desire
them
to
get
a
stable
ready
for
a
gentleman
horses
that
are
coming
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
sponge
added
he
lest
any
one
else
should
chance
to
come
and
usurp
them
tell
john
to
meet
the
express
train
and
tell
the
gentleman
groom
where
it
is
chapter
xiv
jawleyford
court
true
to
a
minute
the
hissing
engine
drew
the
swiftly
gliding
train
beneath
the
elegant
and
costly
station
at
lucksford
an
edifice
presenting
a
rare
contrast
to
the
wretched
old
house
called
the
red
lion
where
a
blacksmith
of
a
landlord
used
to
emerge
from
the
adjoining
smithy
to
take
charge
of
any
one
who
might
arrive
per
coach
for
that
part
of
the
country
sponge
was
quickly
on
the
platform
seeing
to
the
detachment
of
his
just
as
the
cavalry
was
about
got
into
marching
order
up
rode
john
watson
a
gamekeeper
in
a
green
plush
coat
with
a
very
tarnished
laced
hat
mounted
on
a
very
shaggy
white
pony
whose
hide
seemed
quite
impervious
to
the
visitations
of
a
dogwhip
with
which
he
kept
saluting
his
shoulders
and
sides
sir
said
he
riding
up
to
sponge
with
a
touch
of
the
old
hat
got
you
a
capital
stable
at
the
railway
tavern
here
pointing
to
a
newly
built
brick
house
standing
on
the
rising
ground
but
i
going
to
jawleyford
court
responded
our
friend
thinking
the
man

the
of
the
tavern

rejoined
the
man
with
another
touch
of
the
hat

in
observed
sponge
with
an
air
of
authority
i
beg
pardon
sir
replied
the
keeper
thinking
he
had
made
a
mistake
was
sponge
whose
horses
i
had
to
bespeak
stalls
for
touching
his
hat
profusely
as
he
spoke
be
mister
sponge
observed
leather
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
what
passed
said
the
keeper
again
turning
to
our
hero
with
an
beg
pardon

but

says
he

an
emphasis

watson
him
but
he
said

with
a
sideway
shake
of
the
head
a
hack

he
added

stables

at
jawleyford

asked

watson

a
leer

couple
of
weedy
hacks

a
pair
of
old
i
can

observed
sponge
laying
his
hand
on
the
neck
of
the
piebald
as
he
spoke
as
to
that
replied
watson
with
a
shake
of
the
head

sponge
tartly

best
sir
screw
muttered
sponge
turning
away
to
give
his
orders
to
leather
him
for
it
he
added
get
rid
of
in
a
hurry
at
least
not
unless
i
can
get
a
better
billet
elsewhere
having
arranged
the
parting
with
leather
and
got
a
cart
to
carry
his
things
sponge
mounted
the
piebald
and
put
himself
under
the
guidance
of
watson
to
be
conducted
to
his
destination
the
first
part
of
the
journey
was
performed
in
silence
sponge
not
being
particularly
well
pleased
at
the
reception
his
request
to
have
his
horses
taken
in
had
met
with
this
silence
he
might
perhaps
have
preserved
throughout
had
it
not
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
pump
something
out
of
the
servant
about
the
family
he
was
going
to
visit
not
a
old
cob
of
yours
he
observed
drawing
rein
so
as
to
let
the
shaggy
white
come
alongside
of
him
belies
his
looks
then
replied
watson
with
a
grin
of
his
cadaverous
face
he
just
as
bad
a
beast
as
ever
looked
through
a
bridle
it
a
parfect
disgrace
to
a
gentleman
to
put
a
man
on
such
a
beast
sponge
saw
the
sort
of
man
he
had
got
to
deal
with
and
proceeded
accordingly
you
lived
long
with
mr
jawleyford
he
asked
nor
will
i
if
i
can
help
it
replied
watson
with
another
grin
and
another
touch
of
the
old
hat
touching
his
hat
was
about
the
only
piece
of
propriety
he
was
up
to
he
not
a
brick
then
asked
sponge
man
replied
watson
with
a
shake
of
the
head
man
he
repeated
nowise
connected
with
the
i
he
asked
with
a
look
of
suspicion
lest
he
might
be
committing
himself
replied
sponge
merely
an
acquaintance
we
met
at
laverick
wells
and
he
pressed
me
to
come
and
see
him
said
watson
feeling
at
ease
again
did
you
live
with
before
you
came
here
asked
sponge
after
a
pause
lived
many
years
the
greater
part
of
my
life
indeed
with
sir
harry
swift
was
a
gentleman
now
if
you
like
free
gentleman
none
of
your
sort
of
gentlemen
or
imitation
gentlemen
as
i
calls
them
but
a
man
who
knew
what
was
due
to
good
servants
and
gave
them
it
we
had
good
wages
and
all
the
proper
reglars
bless
you
i
could
sell
a
new
suit
of
clothes
there
every
year
instead
of
having
to
wear
the
last
keeper
and
a
hat
that
would
disgrace
anything
but
a
if
the
linin
was
stuffed
full
of
it
would
be
over
my
nose
he
observed
taking
it
off
and
adjusting
the
layer
of
wadding
as
he
spoke
should
have
stuck
to
sir
harry
observed
sponge
did
rejoined
watson
did
i
stuck
to
him
to
the
last
i
have
been
with
him
now
only
he
could
get
a
manor
at
boulogne
and
a
keeper
was
of
no
use
without
one
he
went
to
boulogne
did
he
observed
sponge
the
more
the
pity
replied
watson
was
a
gentleman
every
inch
of
him
he
added
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sigh
as
if
recurring
to
more
prosperous
times
was
what
a
gentleman
ought
to
be
he
continued
one
of
your
poor
pryin
inquisitive
critturs
what
always
themselves
cheated
i
ordered
everything
in
my
department
and
paid
for
it
too
and
never
had
a
bill
disputed
or
even
commented
on
i
might
have
charged
for
a
ton
of
powder
and
never
had
nothin
said
jawleyford
not
likely
to
find
his
way
to
boulogne
i
suppose
observed
sponge
he
exclaimed
watson
he
safe
bird
rich
i
suppose
continued
sponge
with
an
air
of
indifference
should
say
he
was
though
others
say
he
not
replied
watson
cropping
the
old
pony
with
the
as
it
nearly
fell
on
its
nose
ca
fail
to
be
rich
with
all
his
property
though
they
desperate
hands
for
gaddin
about
always
off
to
some
or
another
lookin
for
husbands
i
suppose
i
wonder
he
continued
gentlemen
ca
settle
at
home
and
amuse
themselves
with
coursin
and
shootin
watson
like
many
servants
thinking
that
the
bulk
of
a
gentleman
income
should
be
spent
in
promoting
the
particular
sport
over
which
they
preside
with
this
and
similar
discourse
they
beguiled
the
short
distance
between
the
station
and
the
court
a
distance
however
that
looked
considerably
greater
after
the
flying
rapidity
of
the
rail
but
for
these
occasional
returns
to
people
would
begin
to
fancy
themselves
birds
after
rounding
a
large
but
gently
swelling
hill
over
the
summit
of
which
the
road
after
the
fashion
of
old
roads
led
our
traveller
suddenly
looked
down
upon
the
wide
vale
of
sniperdown
with
jawleyford
court
glittering
with
a
bright
open
aspect
on
a
fine
gradual
elevation
above
the
broad
smoothly
gliding
river
a
clear
atmosphere
indicative
either
of
rain
or
frost
disclosed
a
vast
tract
of
wild
flat
country
to
the
south
little
interrupted
by
woods
or
signs
of
population
the
whole
losing
itself
as
it
were
in
an
indistinct
grey
outline
commingling
with
the
fleecy
white
clouds
in
the
distance
we
be
observed
watson
with
a
nod
towards
where
a
tarnished
flag
floated
or
rather
flapped
lazily
in
the
breeze
above
an
irregular
mass
of
towers
turrets
and
chimneys
illustration
jawleyford
court
was
a
fine
old
mansion
partaking
more
of
the
character
of
a
castle
than
a
court
with
its
keep
and
towers
battlements
heavily
grated
mullioned
windows
and
machicolated
gallery
it
stood
sombre
and
grey
in
the
midst
of
gigantic
but
now
leafless
sycamores
trees
that
had
to
thank
themselves
for
being
sycamores
for
had
they
been
oaks
or
other
marketable
wood
they
would
have
been
made
into
bonnets
or
shawls
long
before
now
the
building
itself
was
irregular
presenting
different
sorts
of
architecture
from
pure
gothic
down
to
some
even
perfectly
modern
buildings
still
viewed
as
a
whole
it
was
massive
and
imposing
and
as
sponge
looked
down
upon
it
he
thought
far
more
of
jawleyford
and
than
he
did
as
the
mere
occupants
of
a
modest
house
at
laverick
wells
nor
did
his
admiration
diminish
as
he
advanced
and
crossing
by
a
battlemented
bridge
over
the
moat
he
viewed
the
massive
character
of
the
buildings
rising
grandly
from
their
rocky
foundation
an
imposing
old
clock
began
striking
four
as
the
horsemen
rode
under
the
gothic
portico
whose
notes
and
reverberated
and
at
last
lost
themselves
among
the
towers
and
pinnacles
of
the
building
sponge
for
a
moment
was
at
the
magnificence
of
the
scene
feeling
that
it
was
what
he
would
call
good
many
cuts
above
him
but
he
soon
recovered
his
wonted
impudence
have
me
thought
he
recalling
the
pressing
nature
of
the
jawleyford
invitation
you
hold
my
nag
said
watson
throwing
himself
off
the
shaggy
white
ring
the
bell
added
he
running
up
a
wide
flight
of
steps
to
the
a
riotous
peal
announced
the
arrival
chapter
xv
the
jawleyford
establishment
the
loud
peal
of
the
jawleyford
court
announcing
arrival
with
which
we
closed
the
last
chapter
found
the
inhabitants
variously
engaged
preparing
for
his
reception
jawleyford
with
the
aid
of
a
very
indifferent
cook
was
endeavouring
to
arrange
a
becoming
dinner
the
young
ladies
with
the
aid
of
a
somewhat
better
sort
of
maid
were
attractifying
themselves
each
looking
with
considerable
jealousy
on
the
efforts
of
the
other
and
jawleyford
was
trotting
from
room
to
room
eyeing
the
various
pictures
of
himself
wondering
which
was
now
the
most
like
and
watching
the
emergence
of
curtains
carpets
and
sofas
from
their
brown
holland
covers
a
gleam
of
sunshine
seemed
to
reign
throughout
the
mansion
the
furniture
appearing
to
have
gained
freshness
by
its
retirement
just
as
a
newly
hat
surprises
the
wearer
by
its
goodness
a
few
days
however
soon
restores
the
defects
of
either
all
these
arrangements
were
suddenly
brought
to
a
close
by
the
peal
of
the
just
as
the
little
of
a
theatre
stops
preparation
and
compels
the
actors
to
stand
forward
as
they
are
jawleyford
threw
aside
her
silk
apron
and
took
a
hasty
glance
of
her
face
in
the
old
mirror
in
the
the
young
ladies
discarded
their
coarse
dirty
and
gently
drew
elaborately
fringed
ones
through
their
taper
fingers
to
give
them
an
air
of
use
as
they
took
a
hasty
review
of
themselves
in
the
swing
mirrors
the
housemaid
hurried
off
with
a
whole
armful
of
brown
holland
and
jawleyford
threw
himself
into
attitude
in
an
elaborately
carved
richly
cushioned
with
a
disraeli
of
lord
george
in
his
hand
but
thoughts
were
far
from
his
book
he
was
sitting
on
thorns
lest
there
might
not
be
a
proper
guard
of
honour
to
receive
sponge
at
the
entrance
jawleyford
as
we
said
before
was
not
the
man
to
entertain
unless
he
could
do
it
and
as
we
all
have
our
of
propriety
up
to
which
we
play
we
may
state
that
jawleyford
note
was
a
butler
and
two
footmen
a
butler
and
two
footmen
he
looked
upon
as
perfectly
indispensable
to
receiving
company
he
chose
to
have
two
footmen
to
follow
the
butler
who
followed
the
gentleman
to
the
spacious
flight
of
steps
leading
from
the
great
hall
to
the
portico
as
he
mounted
his
horse
the
world
is
governed
a
good
deal
by
appearances
jawleyford
started
life
with
two
most
unimpeachable
johns
they
were
nearly
six
feet
high
heads
well
up
and
legs
that
might
have
done
for
models
for
a
sculptor
they
powdered
with
the
greatest
propriety
and
by
two
each
day
were
and
pumped
in
jawleyford
livery
coats
with
massive
silver
and
broad
silver
seams
down
the
front
and
round
their
flaps
silver
garters
at
their
crimson
plush
knees
and
thus
attired
they
were
ready
to
turn
out
with
the
butler
to
receive
visitors
and
conduct
them
back
to
their
carriages
gradually
they
came
down
in
style
but
not
in
number
and
when
sponge
visited
jawleyford
he
had
a
sort
of
who
metamorphosed
himself
into
a
second
footman
at
short
notice
dear
mr
sponge
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
exclaimed
jawleyford
rising
from
his
and
throwing
his
disraeli
aside
as
mr
spigot
the
butler
in
a
deep
sonorous
voice
announced
our
worthy
friend
is
indeed
most
truly
kind
of
you
continued
jawleyford
advancing
to
meet
him
and
getting
our
friend
by
both
hands
he
began
working
his
arms
up
and
down
like
the
under
man
in
a
is
indeed
most
truly
kind
he
repeated
assure
you
i
shall
never
forget
it
it
just
what
i
like
it
just
what
jawleyford
likes
it
just
what
we
like
coming
without
fuss
or
ceremony
spigot
he
added
hailing
old
pomposo
as
the
latter
was
slowly
withdrawing
thinking
what
a
humbug
his
master
was
he
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
the
ladies
know
sponge
is
here
come
to
the
fire
my
dear
fellow
continued
jawleyford
clutching
his
guest
by
the
arm
and
drawing
him
towards
where
an
ample
grate
of
indifferent
coals
was
crackling
and
spluttering
beneath
a
magnificent
old
oak
mantelpiece
of
the
richest
and
costliest
carved
work
to
the
fire
my
dear
fellow
he
repeated
you
feel
cold
and
i
do
wonder
at
it
for
the
day
is
cheerless
and
uncomfortable
and
you
had
a
long
ride
will
you
take
anything
before
dinner
time
do
you
dine
asked
sponge
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
spoke
replied
jawleyford
say
six
not
particular
to
a
moment
days
are
short
you
see
days
are
short
think
i
should
like
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
then
observed
sponge
and
forthwith
the
bell
was
rung
and
in
due
course
of
time
mr
spigot
arrived
with
a
tray
followed
by
the
miss
jawleyfords
who
had
rather
expected
sponge
to
be
shown
into
the
to
them
where
they
had
composed
themselves
very
prettily
one
working
a
parrot
in
chenille
the
other
with
a
lapful
of
crochet
the
miss
jawleyfords
amelia
and
emily
were
lively
girls
hardly
beauties
at
least
not
sufficiently
so
to
attract
attention
in
a
crowd
but
still
girls
well
calculated
to
a
man
to
book
in
the
country
thackeray
who
bound
up
all
the
home
truths
in
circulation
and
many
that
exist
only
in
the
inner
chambers
of
the
heart
calling
the
whole
fair
says
we
think
though
we
do
exactly
know
where
to
lay
hand
on
the
passage
that
it
is
not
your
real
striking
beauties
who
are
the
most
dangerous
at
all
events
that
do
the
most
execution
but
sly
quiet
sort
of
girls
who
do
not
strike
the
beholder
at
first
sight
but
steal
insensibly
upon
him
as
he
gets
acquainted
the
miss
jawleyfords
were
of
this
order
seen
in
plain
morning
gowns
a
man
would
meet
them
in
the
street
without
either
turning
round
or
making
an
observation
good
bad
or
indifferent
but
in
the
close
quarters
of
a
country
house
with
all
the
able
assistance
of
london
dresses
well
flounced
and
set
out
each
bent
on
doing
the
agreeable
they
became
dangerous
the
miss
jawleyfords
were
uncommonly
well
got
up
and
juliana
their
mutual
maid
deserved
great
credit
for
the
impartiality
she
displayed
in
arraying
them
there
was
a
halfpenny
worth
of
choice
as
to
which
was
the
best
this
was
the
more
creditable
to
the
maid
inasmuch
as
the
dresses
glacés
were
rather
dashed
and
the
worse
they
looked
the
likelier
they
would
be
to
become
her
property
dresses
however
that
would
look
rather
seedy
by
contrast
come
out
very
fresh
in
the
country
especially
in
winter
when
day
begins
to
close
in
at
four
and
here
we
may
observe
what
a
dreary
time
is
that
which
intervenes
between
the
arrival
of
a
guest
and
the
dinner
hour
in
the
dead
winter
months
in
the
country
the
english
are
a
desperate
people
for
overweighting
their
conversational
powers
they
have
no
idea
of
penning
up
their
small
talk
and
bringing
it
to
bear
in
generous
flow
upon
one
particular
hour
but
they
keep
dribbling
it
out
throughout
the
day
wearying
their
listeners
without
benefiting
themselves
just
as
a
careless
waggoner
scatters
his
load
on
the
road
few
people
are
insensible
to
the
advantage
of
having
their
champagne
brisk
which
can
only
be
done
by
keeping
the
cork
in
but
few
ever
think
of
keeping
the
cork
of
their
own
conversation
in
see
a
frenchman
how
light
and
buoyant
he
trips
into
a
fresh
from
the
satisfactory
scrutiny
of
the
with
all
the
news
and
jokes
and
of
the
day
in
full
bloom
how
sparkling
and
radiant
he
is
with
something
smart
and
pleasant
to
say
to
every
one
how
thoroughly
happy
and
easy
he
is
and
what
a
contrast
to
phlegmatic
john
bull
who
stands
with
his
great
red
fists
doubled
looking
as
if
he
thought
whoever
spoke
to
him
would
be
wanting
him
to
endorse
a
bill
of
exchange
but
as
we
said
before
the
dread
hour
before
dinner
is
an
awful
time
in
the
country
frightful
when
there
are
two
hours
and
never
a
subject
in
common
for
the
company
to
work
upon
laverick
wells
and
their
mutual
acquaintance
was
all
sponge
and
jawleyford
and
that
was
a
very
small
capital
to
begin
upon
for
they
had
been
there
together
too
short
a
time
to
make
much
of
a
purse
of
conversation
even
the
young
ladies
with
their
inquiries
after
the
respective
flirtations
how
miss
sawney
and
captain
snubnose
were
on
and
whether
the
rich
widow
spankley
was
likely
to
bring
sir
thomas
greedey
to
book
failed
to
make
up
a
conversation
for
sponge
knew
little
of
the
ins
and
outs
of
these
matters
his
attention
having
been
more
directed
to
waffles
than
any
one
else
still
the
mere
questions
put
in
a
playful
womanly
way
helped
the
time
on
and
prevented
things
coming
to
that
frightful
deadlock
of
silence
that
causes
an
involuntary
inward
exclamation
of
to
get
through
the
time
with
this
man
there
are
people
who
seem
to
think
that
sitting
and
looking
at
each
other
constitutes
society
women
have
a
great
advantage
over
men
in
the
talking
way
they
have
always
something
to
say
let
a
lot
of
women
be
huddled
together
throughout
the
whole
of
a
livelong
day
and
they
will
yet
have
such
a
balance
of
conversation
at
night
as
to
render
it
necessary
to
convert
a
bedroom
into
a
to
get
rid
of
it
men
however
soon
get
high
and
dry
especially
before
dinner
and
a
host
ought
to
be
at
liberty
to
read
the
riot
act
and
disperse
them
to
their
bedrooms
till
such
times
as
they
wanted
to
eat
and
drink
a
most
scientifically
sounded
gong
beginning
low
like
distant
thunder
and
gradually
increasing
its
murmur
till
it
filled
the
whole
mansion
with
its
roar
at
length
relieved
all
parties
from
the
labour
of
further
efforts
and
looking
at
his
watch
jawleyford
asked
jawleyford
in
an
innocent
indifferent
sort
of
way
which
was
sponge
room
though
he
had
been
fussing
about
it
not
long
before
and
dusting
the
portrait
of
himself
in
his
yeomanry
uniform
with
an
old
crimson
room
my
dear
replied
the
jawleyford
and
spigot
coming
with
candles
jawleyford
preceded
sponge
up
a
splendid
richly
carved
oak
staircase
of
such
gradual
and
easy
rise
that
an
invalid
might
almost
have
been
drawn
up
it
in
a
passing
a
short
distance
along
a
spacious
corridor
jawleyford
presently
opened
a
door
to
the
right
and
led
the
way
into
a
large
gloomy
room
with
a
little
newly
lighted
wood
fire
crackling
in
an
enormous
grate
making
darkness
visible
and
drawing
the
cold
out
of
the
walls
we
need
scarcely
say
it
was
that
terrible
room
the
best
with
three
creaking
windows
and
heavy
crimson
furniture
so
old
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
sustain
its
own
weight
here
you
are
observed
jawleyford
as
he
nearly
tripped
over
sponge
luggage
as
it
stood
by
the
fire
you
are
repeated
he
giving
the
candle
a
flourish
to
show
the
size
of
the
room
and
draw
it
back
on
the
portrait
of
himself
above
the
mantelpiece
i
declare
here
an
old
picture
of
myself
said
he
holding
the
candle
up
to
the
face
as
if
he
had
seen
it
for
some
time
picture
that
was
done
when
i
was
in
the
bumperkin
yeomanry
continued
he
passing
the
light
before
the
facings
was
considered
a
good
likeness
at
the
time
said
he
looking
affectionately
at
it
and
feeling
his
nose
to
see
if
it
was
still
the
same
size
was
a
capital
corps
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
very
best
in
the
service
the
inspecting
officer
always
spoke
of
it
in
the
highest
possible
terms
especially
of
company
which
really
was
just
as
perfect
as
anything
my
lord
cardigan
or
any
of
your
crack
disciplinarians
can
produce
however
never
mind
continued
he
lowering
the
candle
seeing
sponge
did
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
be
wanting
to
dress
you
find
hot
water
on
the
table
yonder
pointing
to
the
far
corner
of
the
room
where
the
outline
of
a
jug
might
just
be
descried
a
bell
in
the
bed
if
you
want
anything
and
dinner
will
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
dressed
you
need
make
yourself
very
fine
added
he
as
he
retired
we
are
only
ourselves
hope
we
shall
have
some
of
our
neighbours
or
next
day
but
we
are
rather
badly
off
for
neighbours
just
here
at
least
for
neighbours
so
saying
he
disappeared
through
the
dark
doorway
the
latter
statement
was
true
enough
for
jawleyford
though
apparently
such
a
fine
sociable
sort
of
man
was
in
reality
a
very
quarrelsome
troublesome
fellow
he
quarrelled
with
all
his
neighbours
in
succession
generally
getting
through
them
every
two
or
three
years
and
his
acquaintance
were
divided
into
two
classes
the
best
and
the
worst
fellows
under
the
sun
a
stranger
revising
jawleyford
after
an
absence
of
a
year
or
two
would
very
likely
find
the
best
fellows
of
former
days
transformed
into
the
worst
ones
of
that
thus
parson
hobanob
that
pet
victim
of
country
caprice
would
come
in
and
go
out
of
season
like
lamb
or
asparagus
major
moustache
and
jawleyford
would
be
as
as
one
day
and
at
daggers
drawn
the
next
squire
squaretoes
of
squaretoes
house
and
he
were
continually
kissing
or
cutting
and
even
distance
nine
miles
of
bad
road
and
of
course
heavy
tolls
could
not
keep
the
peace
between
lawyer
seedywig
and
him
what
between
rows
and
reconciliations
jawleyford
was
always
at
work
chapter
xvi
the
dinner
illustration
notwithstanding
jawleyford
recommendation
to
the
contrary
sponge
made
himself
an
uncommon
swell
he
put
on
a
desperately
stiff
starcher
secured
in
front
with
a
large
gold
pin
with
carbuncle
eyes
a
fine
shirt
with
a
slight
tendency
to
pink
adorned
with
studs
of
sparkling
diamonds
or
french
paste
as
the
case
might
be
a
white
waistcoat
with
fancy
buttons
a
blue
coat
with
bright
plain
ones
and
a
velvet
collar
black
tights
with
broad
stockings
socks
rather
and
patent
leather
pumps
with
gilt
buckles
sponge
was
proud
of
his
leg
the
young
ladies
too
turned
out
rather
smart
for
amelia
finding
that
emily
was
going
to
put
on
her
new
yellow
watered
silk
instead
of
a
dyed
satin
she
had
talked
of
made
juliana
produce
her
blue
satin
dress
out
of
the
wardrobe
in
the
green
where
it
had
been
laid
away
in
an
old
tablecloth
and
bound
her
dark
hair
with
a
wreath
which
emily
met
by
crowning
herself
with
a
chaplet
of
white
roses
thus
attired
with
smiles
assumed
at
the
door
the
young
ladies
entered
the
in
the
full
fervour
of
sisterly
animosity
they
were
very
much
alike
in
size
shape
and
face
they
were
tallish
and
miss
jawleyford
features
being
rather
more
strongly
marked
and
her
eyes
a
shade
darker
than
her
sister
while
there
was
a
sort
of
subdued
air
about
her
the
result
perhaps
of
enlarged
intercourse
with
the
world
or
maybe
of
disappointments
emily
eyes
sparkled
and
glittered
without
knowing
perhaps
why
dinner
was
presently
announced
it
was
of
the
imposing
order
that
people
give
their
friends
on
a
first
visit
as
though
their
appetites
were
larger
on
that
day
than
on
any
other
they
dined
off
plate
the
sideboards
glittered
with
the
jawleyford
arms
on
cups
tankards
and
salvers
and
turner
flamed
and
swealed
in
profusion
on
the
table
while
every
now
and
then
an
expiring
lamp
on
the
sideboards
or
brackets
proclaimed
the
unwonted
splendour
of
the
scene
and
added
a
flavour
to
the
repast
not
contemplated
by
the
cook
the
room
which
was
large
and
lofty
being
but
rarely
used
had
a
cold
uncomfortable
feel
and
if
it
been
for
the
looks
of
the
thing
jawleyford
would
perhaps
as
soon
that
they
had
dined
in
the
little
breakfast
parlour
still
there
was
everything
very
smart
spigot
in
full
fig
with
a
shirt
frill
nearly
tickling
his
nose
an
acre
of
white
waistcoat
and
glorious
calves
swelling
within
his
stockings
the
improvised
footman
went
creaking
about
as
such
gentlemen
generally
do
the
style
was
perhaps
better
than
the
repast
still
they
had
shell
and
tortoise
to
be
sure
but
still
while
the
wines
were
supplied
by
the
firm
of
jawleyford
sank
where
he
got
it
and
pretended
that
it
had
been
in
his
cellar
really
had
such
a
stock
that
he
thought
he
should
never
get
through
it
to
wit
two
dozen
old
port
at
a
dozen
and
one
dozen
at
two
dozen
pale
sherry
at
and
one
dozen
brown
ditto
at
three
bottles
of
bucellas
of
the
quality
imported
at
a
dozen
lisbon
and
dry
at
and
some
marvellous
creaming
champagne
at
in
which
they
were
indulging
when
he
made
the
declaration
wait
of
me
my
dear
mr
sponge
exclaimed
jawleyford
holding
up
a
long
of
a
glass
with
the
jawleyford
crests
emblazoned
about
wait
of
me
pray
repeated
he
as
spigot
finished
dribbling
the
froth
into
sponge
glass
and
jawleyford
with
a
flourishing
bow
and
waive
of
his
empty
drank
sponge
very
good
health
adding
happy
to
see
you
at
jawleyford
court
it
was
then
jawleyford
turn
to
have
a
little
froth
and
having
sucked
it
up
with
the
air
of
a
man
drinking
nectar
he
set
down
his
glass
with
a
shake
of
the
head
saying
no
such
wine
as
that
to
be
got
wine
excellent
exclaimed
sponge
who
was
a
better
judge
of
ale
than
of
champagne
where
might
you
get
it
to
say
impossible
to
say
replied
jawleyford
throwing
up
his
hands
with
a
shake
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
have
such
a
stock
of
wine
as
is
really
quite
ridiculous
ridiculous
thought
spigot
who
by
the
aid
of
a
false
key
had
been
through
the
cellar
except
the
and
tortoise
and
the
estate
supplied
the
repast
the
carp
was
out
of
the
the
tench
or
whatever
it
was
was
out
of
the
the
mutton
was
from
the
farm
the
stewed
beef
was
from
ditto
while
the
garden
supplied
the
vegetables
that
luxuriated
in
the
massive
silver
watson
gun
furnished
the
old
hare
and
partridges
that
opened
the
ball
of
the
second
course
and
tarts
jellies
preserves
and
custards
made
their
usual
appearances
some
chateaux
margaux
again
at
in
very
richly
cut
decanters
accompanied
the
old
port
and
apples
pears
nuts
figs
preserved
fruits
occupied
the
splendid
dessert
set
everything
of
course
was
handed
about
an
ingenious
way
of
tormenting
a
person
that
has
the
ladies
sat
long
jawleyford
taking
three
glasses
of
port
when
she
could
get
it
and
it
was
a
quarter
to
eight
when
they
rose
from
the
table
jawleyford
then
moved
an
adjournment
to
the
fire
which
sponge
gladly
seconded
for
he
had
never
been
warm
since
he
came
into
the
house
the
heat
from
the
fires
seeming
to
go
up
the
chimneys
spigot
set
them
a
little
round
table
placing
the
port
and
claret
upon
it
and
bringing
them
a
plate
of
biscuits
in
lieu
of
the
dessert
he
then
reduced
the
illumination
on
the
table
and
extinguished
such
of
the
lamps
as
had
not
gone
out
of
themselves
having
cast
an
approving
glance
around
and
seen
that
they
had
what
he
considered
right
he
left
them
to
their
own
devices
you
drink
port
or
claret
mr
sponge
asked
jawleyford
preparing
to
push
whichever
he
preferred
over
to
him
take
a
little
port
if
you
please
replied
our
friend
as
much
as
to
say
finish
off
with
claret
find
that
very
good
i
expect
said
jawleyford
passing
the
bottle
to
him
wine
very
rare
wine
to
get
now
was
a
very
rich
fruity
wine
and
was
a
long
time
before
it
came
into
drinking
connoisseurs
would
give
any
money
for
it
has
still
a
good
deal
of
body
observed
sponge
turning
off
a
glass
and
smacking
his
lips
at
the
same
time
holding
the
glass
up
to
the
candle
to
see
the
oily
mark
it
made
on
the
side
sound
wine
good
sound
wine
said
jawleyford
plenty
lighter
if
you
like
the
light
wine
was
made
by
watering
the
strong
no
thank
you
replied
sponge
no
thank
you
i
like
good
strong
military
port
do
i
said
jawleyford
do
i
only
unfortunately
it
like
me
am
obliged
to
drink
claret
when
i
was
in
the
bumperkin
yeomanry
we
drank
nothing
but
port
and
then
jawleyford
diverged
into
a
long
rambling
dissertation
on
messes
and
cavalry
tactics
which
nearly
sent
sponge
asleep
did
you
say
the
hounds
are
at
length
asked
he
after
jawleyford
had
talked
himself
out
repeated
jawleyford
thoughtfully
they
hunt
not

of
their
days
next
day

dundleton

is
that
from

asked
sponge
ten
miles
say
ten
miles
replied
jawleyford
it
was
sometimes
ten
and
sometimes
fifteen
depending
upon
whether
jawleyford
wanted
the
party
to
go
or
not
these
elastic
places
however
are
common
in
all
countries
to
as
well
as
to
hunters
by
close
by
one
day
a
way
from
here
another
it
is
difficult
for
parties
who
have
nothing
in
common
to
drive
a
conversation
especially
when
each
keeps
jibbing
to
get
upon
a
private
subject
of
his
own
jawleyford
was
all
for
sounding
sponge
as
to
where
he
came
from
and
the
situation
of
his
property
for
as
yet
it
must
be
remembered
he
knew
nothing
of
our
friend
save
what
he
had
gleaned
at
laverick
wells
where
certainly
all
parties
concurred
in
placing
him
high
on
the
list
of
while
sponge
wanted
to
talk
about
hunting
the
meets
of
the
hounds
and
hear
what
sort
of
a
man
lord
scamperdale
was
so
they
kept
playing
at
without
either
getting
much
out
of
the
other
jawleyford
intimacy
with
lord
scamperdale
seemed
to
have
diminished
with
propinquity
for
he
now
no
longer
talked
of
him
this
and
scamperdale
that
scamperdale
with
whom
he
could
do
anything
he
liked
but
he
called
him
lord
scamperdale
and
spoke
of
him
in
a
reverent
and
becoming
way
distance
often
lends
boldness
to
the
tongue
as
the
poet
campbell
says
it
lends
enchantment
to
the
view
and
robes
the
mountain
in
its
azure
hue
there
are
few
great
men
who
have
a
dozen
people
at
least
who
them
right
as
they
call
it
to
hear
some
of
the
creatures
talk
one
would
fancy
a
lord
was
a
lunatic
as
a
matter
of
course
spigot
at
last
put
an
end
to
their
efforts
by
announcing
that
and
coffee
were
ready
just
as
sponge
buzzed
his
bottle
of
port
they
then
adjourned
from
the
gloom
of
the
large
to
the
effulgent
radiance
of
the
highly
gilt
where
our
fair
friends
had
commenced
talking
sponge
over
as
soon
as
they
retired
from
the
chapter
xvii
the
tea
what
do
you
think
of
asked
mamma
i
think
he
very
well
replied
emily
gaily
should
say
he
was
very
drawled
miss
jawleyford
who
reckoned
herself
rather
a
judge
and
indeed
had
had
some
experience
of
gentlemen
my
dear
rejoined
jawleyford
should
say
he
very
well
rather
indeed
should
say
replied
miss
jawleyford
height
and
figure
are
certainly
in
his
favour
but
he
is
quite
my
idea
of
a
gentleman
he
is
evidently
on
good
terms
with
himself
but
i
should
say
if
it
was
for
his
forwardness
he
be
awkward
and
uneasy
a
you
know
observed
emily
but
i
do
know
that
that
should
make
him
different
to
other
people
rejoined
her
sister
curzon
and
lancaster
and
preston
were
all
but
they
did
stare
and
blurt
and
kick
their
legs
about
as
this
man
does
you
are
so
fastidious
rejoined
her
mamma
must
take
men
as
you
find
them
wonder
where
he
lives
observed
emily
who
was
quite
ready
to
take
our
friend
as
he
was
wonder
where
he
live
chimed
in
jawleyford
for
the
suddenness
of
the
descent
had
given
them
no
time
for
inquiry
said
manchester
observed
miss
jawleyford
drily
much
the
better
observed
jawleyford
then
he
is
sure
to
have
plenty
of
money
ma
but
you
do
pa
would
ever
allow
such
a
thing
retorted
miss
recollecting
her
papa
frequent
exhortations
to
them
to
look
high
he
a
landowner
observed
jawleyford
soon
find
him
out
in
emily
my
dear
added
she
go
into
your
pa
room
and
bring
me
the
you
find
it
on
the
large
table
between
the
and
the
emily
tripped
away
to
do
as
she
was
bid
the
fair
messenger
presently
returned
bearing
both
volumes
richly
bound
and
lettered
with
the
jawleyford
crests
studded
down
the
backs
and
an
immense
coat
of
arms
on
the
side
a
careful
search
among
the
s
produced
nothing
in
the
shape
of
sponge
likely
i
should
think
observed
miss
jawleyford
with
a
toss
of
her
head
as
her
mamma
announced
the
fact
never
mind
replied
jawleyford
seeing
that
only
one
of
the
girls
could
have
him
and
that
one
was
quite
ready
mind
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
able
to
find
out
something
from
himself
and
so
they
dropped
the
subject
in
due
time
in
swaggered
our
hero
himself
kicking
his

in

she
raised
her
finely
turned
gloveless
arm
towards
where
the
glittering
appendages
stood
on
the
large
silver
tray
thank
you
said
sponge
throwing
himself
into
an
beside
jawleyford
he
then
crossed
his
legs
and
cocking
up
a
toe
for
admiration
began
to
yawn

tired
after
your
journey

jawleyford
i

yawning
again
a
good
yawn
this
time
miss
jawleyford
looked
significantly
at
her
sister
a
long
pause
ensued
knew
a
family
of
your
name
at
length
observed
jawleyford
in
the
simple
sort
of
way
women
begin
pumping
men
knew
a
family
of
your
name
repeated
she
seeing
sponge

half
asleep

ah

sponges

are
a
rather
large
family

almost
everywhere

live
in
the
same
county
perhaps
observed
jawleyford
we
do
replied
he
with
a
yawn

a
good
hunting
country
asked
jawleyford
thinking
to
sound
him
in
another
way
a
devilish
bad
replied
sponge
adding
with
a
grunt
i
would
be
here
hunts
it
asked
jawleyford
as
to
that
haw
replied
sponge
stretching
out
his
arms
and
legs
to
their
fullest
extent
and
yawning
most
vigorously
as
to
that
i
can
hardly
say
which
you
would
call
my
country
for
i
have
to
do
with
so
many
but
i
should
say
of
all
the
countries
i
am
haw
connected
with
haw
tom
scratch
is
the
worst
jawleyford
looked
at
jawleyford
as
a
counsel
who
thinks
he
has
made
a
grand
hit
looks
at
a
jury
before
he
sits
down
and
said
no
more
jawleyford
looked
as
innocent
as
most
jurymen
do
after
one
of
these
forensic
mr

beginning
his
nasal
recreations
jawleyford
motioned
the
ladies
off
to

and
his
host
presently
followed

the
evening
reflections
i
think
he
do
said
our
friend
to
himself
as
having
reached
his
bedroom
in
accordance
with
modern
fashion
he
applied
a
cedar
match
to
the
now
somewhat
better
fire
for
the
purpose
of
lighting
a
cigar
a
cigar
in
the
of
jawleyford
court
having
divested
himself
of
his
smart
blue
coat
and
white
waistcoat
and
arrayed
himself
in
a
grey
he
adjusted
the
loose
cushions
of
a
recumbent
chair
and
soused
himself
into
its
luxurious
depths
for
a
over
has
money
mused
sponge
between
the
copious
whiffs
of
the
cigar
style
he
lives
in
to
be
sure

continued
he
after
another
long
draw
as
he
adjusted
the
ash
at
the
end
of
the

in
livery

out
ca
be
done
for

puff
a
profusion
of

i
never
puff
whiff
puff
in
the
whole
course
of
my
whiff
puff
the
cigar
being
then
well
under
way
he
sucked
and
puffed
and
whiffed
in
an
apparently
vacant
stupor
his
legs
crossed
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
projecting
coal
between
the
lower
bars
as
if
intent
on
watching
the
alternations
of
flame
and
gas
though
in
reality
he
was
running
all
the
circumstances
through
his
mind
comparing
them
with
his
past
experience
and
speculating
on
the
probable
result
of
the
present
adventure
he
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
in
the
matrimonial
wars
and
was
entitled
to
as
many
bars
as
the
most
distinguished
peninsular
veteran
no
woman
with
money
or
the
reputation
of
it
ever
wanted
an
offer
while
he
was
in
the
way
for
he
would
accommodate
her
at
the
second
or
third
interview
and
always
pressed
for
an
immediate
fulfilment
lest
the
lawyers
should
interfere
and
interrupt
their
felicity
somehow
or
other
the
lawyers
always
had
interfered
and
as
sure
as
they
walked
in
sponge
walked
out
he
could
bear
the
idea
of
their
coarse
inquisitive
inquiries
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
love
light
as
air
at
sight
of
human
ties
spreads
his
light
wings
and
in
a
moment
flies
so
sponge
fled
consoling
himself
with
the
reflection
that
there
was
no
harm
done
and
hoping
for
luck
next
time
he
roved
from
flower
to
flower
like
a
butterfly
touching
here
alighting
there
but
always
passing
away
with
apparent
indifference
he
knew
if
he
could
square
matters
at
short
notice
he
would
have
no
better
chance
with
an
extension
of
time
so
if
he
saw
things
taking
the
direction
of
inquiry
he
would
just
laugh
the
offer
off
pretend
he
was
only
feeling
his
way
saw
he
was
not
acceptable
sorry
for
it
and
away
he
would
go
to
somebody
else
he
looked
upon
a
woman
much
in
the
light
of
a
horse
if
she
did
suit
one
man
she
would
another
and
there
was
no
harm
in
trying
so
he
puffed
and
smoked
and
smoked
and
puffed
gliding
gradually
into
wealth
and
prosperity
illustration
sponge
as
he
appeared
in
the
best
bedroom
a
second
cigar
assisted
his
comprehension
considerably
just
as
a
second
bottle
of
wine
not
only
helps
men
through
their
difficulties
but
shows
them
the
way
to
unbounded
wealth
many
of
the
bright
railway
schemes
of
former
days
we
make
no
doubt
were
concocted
under
the
inspiring
influence
of
the
bottle
sponge
now
saw
everything
as
he
wished
all
the
errors
of
his
former
days
were
apparent
to
him
he
saw
how
indiscreet
it
was
confiding
in
miss
trickery
cousin
the
major
why
the
rich
widow
at
chesterfield
had
him
and
how
he
was
done
out
of
the
beautiful
miss
rainbow
with
her
beautiful
estate
with
its
lake
its
heronry
and
its
perpetual
advowson
other
mishaps
he
also
considered
having
disposed
of
the
past
he
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
future
here
were
two
beautiful
girls
apparently
full
of
money
between
whom
there
was
the
of
a
halfpenny
for
choice
most
exemplary
parents
too
who
did
seem
to
care
a
farthing
about
money
he
then
began
speculating
on
what
the
girls
would
have
house
great
establishment
great
estate
doubtless
why
confound
it
continued
he
casting
his
heavy
eye
lazily
around
a
room
as
big
as
a
field
in
a
cramped
country
ca
have
less
than
fifty
thousand
i
should
say
at
the
least
jawleyford
to
be
sure
is
young
thought
he
live
a
long
time
puff
were
to
die
curse
the
cigar
burnt
my
lips
added
he
throwing
the
remnant
into
the
fire
and
rolling
out
of
the
chair
to
prepare
for
turning
into
bed
if
any
one
had
told
sponge
that
there
was
a
rich
papa
and
mamma
on
the
merely
for
amiable
young
men
to
bestow
their
fair
daughters
upon
he
would
have
laughed
them
to
scorn
and
said
you
fool
they
are
only
laughing
at
you
or
you
see
they
are
playing
you
off
against
somebody
else
but
our
hero
like
other
men
was
blind
where
he
himself
was
concerned
and
concluded
that
he
was
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
jawleyford
had
their
consultation
too
said
jawleyford
seating
himself
on
the
high
wire
fender
immediately
below
a
marble
bust
of
himself
on
the
mantelpiece
think
he
do
no
doubt
replied
jawleyford
who
never
saw
any
difficulty
in
the
way
of
a
match
should
say
he
is
a
very
nice
young
man
continued
she
brusque
in
his
manner
perhaps
observed
jawleyford
who
was
quite
the
himself
wonder
what
he
was
added
he
fingering
away
at
his
whiskers
rich
i
no
doubt
replied
jawleyford
makes
you
think
so
asked
her
loving
spouse
do
know
replied
jawleyford
i
feel
certain
he
is
but
i
ca
tell
why
all
are
do
know
that
replied
jawleyford
who
knew
some
very
poor
ones
should
like
to
know
what
he
has
continued
jawleyford
musingly
looking
up
at
the
deeply
corniced
ceiling
as
if
he
were
calculating
the
chances
among
the
filagree
ornaments
of
the
centre
hundred
thousand
perhaps
suggested
jawleyford
who
only
knew
two
sums
fifty
and
a
hundred
thousand
a
vast
of
money
replied
jawleyford
with
a
slight
shake
of
the
head
at
least
then
suggested
jawleyford
coming
down
at
once
if
he
has
that
he
do
rejoined
jawleyford
who
also
had
come
down
considerably
in
his
expectations
since
the
vision
of
his
railway
days
at
whose
bright
light
he
had
burnt
his
fingers
was
said
to
have
an
immense
fortune
i
forget
how
much
at
laverick
wells
observed
jawleyford
we
see
said
jawleyford
adding
suppose
either
of
the
girls
will
be
glad
enough
to
take
him
them
for
that
replied
jawleyford
with
a
knowing
smile
and
nod
of
the
head
them
for
that
repeated
she
amelia
does
turn
up
her
nose
and
pretend
to
be
fine
rely
upon
it
she
only
wants
to
be
sure
that
he
worth
having
seems
ready
enough
at
all
events
observed
jawleyford
never
get
the
chance
observed
jawleyford
is
a
very
prudent
girl
and
wo
commit
herself
but
she
knows
how
to
manage
the
men
then
said
jawleyford
with
a
hearty
yawn
suppose
we
may
as
well
go
to
bed
so
saying
he
took
his
candle
and
retired
chapter
xix
the
wet
day
when
the
dirty
housemaid
came
in
the
morning
with
her
to
light
sponge
fire
a
riotous
winter
day
was
in
the
full
swing
of
its
gloomy
deluging
power
the
wind
howled
and
roared
and
whistled
and
shrieked
playing
a
sort
of
æolian
harp
amongst
the
towers
pinnacles
and
irregular
castleisations
of
the
house
while
the
old
casements
rattled
and
shook
as
though
some
one
were
trying
to
knock
them
in
the
day
muttered
sponge
from
beneath
the
bedclothes
the
deuce
is
a
man
to
do
with
himself
on
such
a
day
as
this
in
the
country
thinking
how
much
better
he
would
be
flattening
his
nose
against
the
window
of
the
bantam
or
strolling
through
the
stables
in
piccadilly
or
oxford
street
presently
the
chair
before
the
fire
with
the
picture
of
jawleyford
in
the
bumperkin
yeomanry
as
seen
through
the
parted
curtains
of
the
spacious
bed
recalled
his
speculations
and
he
began
to
think
that
perhaps
he
was
just
as
well
where
he
was
he
then
his
ideas
to
where
he
had
left
off
and
again
began
speculating
on
the
chances
of
his
position
fine
girls
said
he
of
wonder
what
he
give
down
recurring
to
his
speculations
and
hitting
upon
the
point
at
which
he
had
burnt
his
lips
with
the
end
of
the
cigar
namely
jawleyford
youth
and
the
possibility
of
his
marrying
again
if
jawleyford
were
to
die
wo
do
to
raise
up
difficulties
for
one
self
however
mused
he
so
kicking
off
the
bedclothes
he
raised
himself
instead
and
making
for
a
window
began
to
gaze
upon
his
expectant
territory
it
was
a
terrible
day
the
ragged
spongy
clouds
drifted
heavily
along
and
the
lowering
gloom
was
only
enlivened
by
the
occasional
driving
rush
of
the
tempest
earth
and
sky
were
pretty
much
the
same
grey
damp
disagreeable
hue
said
sponge
to
himself
having
gazed
sufficiently
on
the
uninviting
landscape
just
as
well
it
not
a
hunting
day
should
have
got
terribly
soused
must
get
through
the
time
as
well
as
i
can
girls
to
talk
to
house
to
see
hope
i
brought
my
added
he
turning
to
his
portmanteau
and
diving
for
his
thousand
cab
having
found
the
invaluable
volume
his
almost
constant
study
he
then
proceeded
to
array
himself
in
what
he
considered
the
most
captivating
apparel
a
new
coatee
with
outside
pockets
placed
very
low
faultless
drab
trousers
a
buff
waistcoat
with
a
silk
tie
secured
by
red
cornelian
set
in
gold
for
a
pin
thus
attired
with
in
his
pocket
he
swaggered
down
to
the
which
he
hit
off
by
means
of
listening
at
the
doors
till
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
within
jawleyford
and
the
young
ladies
were
all
smiles
and
smirks
and
there
were
no
symptoms
of
miss
jawleyford
perceptible
they
all
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
our
friend
most
cordially
jawleyford
too
was
all
flourish
and
compliment
now
tilting
at
the
weather
now
congratulating
himself
upon
having
secured
sponge
society
in
the
house
that
leisurely
meal
of
protracted
ease
a
breakfast
being
at
length
accomplished
and
the
ladies
having
taken
their
departure
jawleyford
looked
out
on
the
terrace
upon
which
the
angry
rain
was
beating
the
standing
water
into
bubbles
and
observing
that
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
out
asked
sponge
if
he
could
amuse
himself
in
the
house
yes
replied
he
a
book
in
my
pocket
i
suppose
the
perhaps
observed
jawleyford
replied
sponge
of
then
i
dare
say
suggested
jawleyford
adding
reading
it
myself
nor
that
either
replied
sponge
with
a
knowing
look
much
more
useful
work
i
assure
you
added
he
pulling
the
little
volume
out
of
his
pocket
and
reading
the
gilt
letters
on
the
back
ten
thousand
cab
price
one
shilling
exclaimed
jawleyford
i
should
never
have
guessed
that
dare
say
not
replied
sponge
dare
say
not
it
a
book
i
never
travel
without
it
invaluable
in
town
and
you
may
study
it
to
great
advantage
in
the
country
with
in
my
hand
i
can
almost
fancy
myself
in
both
places
at
once
omnibus
guide
added
he
turning
over
the
leaves
and
reading
five
from
the
end
of
oxford
street
and
the
edger
road
see
ealing
edmonton
seven
from
shoreditch
church
green
man
and
still
oxford
street
shepherd
bush
and
starch
green
bank
and
whitechapel
tooting
totteridge
wandsworth
in
short
every
place
near
town
then
the
cab
fares
are
truly
invaluable
you
have
ten
thousand
of
them
here
said
he
tapping
the
book
you
may
calculate
as
many
more
for
yourself
as
ever
you
like
nothing
to
do
but
sit
in
an
on
a
wet
day
like
this
and
say
if
from
the
mile
end
turnpike
to
the
castle
on
the
kingsland
road
is
so
much
how
much
should
it
be
to
the
yorkshire
stingo
or
maida
vale
and
you
measure
by
other
fares
till
you
get
as
near
the
place
you
want
as
you
can
if
it
is
set
down
in
black
and
white
to
your
hand
in
the
book
so
said
jawleyford
so
it
must
be
a
very
useful
work
indeed
very
useful
work
i
get
one
i
get
one
how
much
did
you
say
it
was
a
guinea
a
guinea
shilling
replied
sponge
adding
may
have
mine
for
a
guinea
if
you
like
jove
what
a
day
it
is
observed
jawleyford
turning
the
conversation
as
the
wind
dashed
the
hard
sleet
against
the
window
like
a
shower
of
pebbles
to
have
a
good
house
over
one
head
such
weather
and
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
i
show
you
my
new
gallery
and
collection
of
curiosities
pictures
busts
marbles
antiques
and
so
on
there
be
fires
on
and
we
shall
be
just
as
well
there
as
here
so
saying
jawleyford
led
the
way
through
a
dark
intricate
shabby
passage
to
where
a
much
gilded
white
door
with
a
handsome
crimson
curtain
over
it
announced
the
entrance
to
something
better
said
jawleyford
bowing
as
he
threw
open
the
door
and
motioned
or
rather
flourished
his
guest
to
enter
said
he
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
sponge
entered
accordingly
and
found
himself
at
the
end
of
a
gallery
fifty
feet
by
twenty
and
fourteen
high
lighted
by
skylights
and
small
windows
round
the
top
there
were
fires
in
handsome
fireplaces
on
either
side
a
large
timepiece
and
an
organ
at
the
far
end
and
sundry
white
basins
scattered
about
catching
the
drops
from
the
skylights
the
rain
exclaimed
jawleyford
as
he
saw
it
trickling
over
a
river
scene
of
van
goyen
gentlemen
in
a
yacht
and
figures
in
boats
and
drip
drip
dripping
on
to
the
head
of
an
infant
bacchus
below
wants
an
umbrella
that
young
gentleman
observed
sponge
as
jawleyford
proceeded
to
dry
him
with
his
handkerchief
thing
observed
jawleyford
starting
off
to
a
side
and
pointing
to
it
thing
italian
marble
by
frère
cost
a
vast
of
money
was
offered
three
hundred
for
it
are
you
a
judge
of
these
things
asked
jawleyford
you
a
judge
of
these
things
little
replied
sponge
little
thinking
he
might
as
well
see
what
his
intended
personal
property
was
like
a
beautiful
thing
observed
jawleyford
pointing
to
another
group
picked
that
up
for
a
mere
nothing
twenty
guineas
worth
two
hundred
at
least
lipsalve
the
great
in
gammon
passage
offered
me
murillo
adoration
of
the
virgin
and
shepherds
for
which
he
showed
me
a
receipt
for
a
hundred
and
for
it
replied
sponge
is
it
a
bacchanal
group
after
poussin
sculptured
by
marin
i
bought
it
at
lord
breakdown
sale
it
happened
to
be
a
wet
day
much
such
a
day
as
this
and
things
went
for
nothing
this
you
know
i
presume
observed
jawleyford
laying
his
hand
on
a
bust
of
diana
in
italian
marble
i
do
replied
sponge
exclaimed
jawleyford
thought
everybody
had
known
this
this
is
my
celebrated
diana
by
noindon
one
of
the
finest
things
in
the
world
louis
philippe
sent
an
agent
over
to
this
country
expressly
to
buy
it
did
you
sell
it
him
asked
sponge
want
the
money
replied
jawleyford
want
the
money
in
addition
to
which
though
a
king
he
was
a
bit
of
a
screw
and
we
agree
upon
terms
this
observed
jawleyford
a
vase
of
the
cinque
cento
period
a
very
fine
thing
and
this
laying
his
hand
on
the
crown
of
a
much
frizzed
bust
course
you
know
i
do
replied
sponge
exclaimed
jawleyford
in
astonishment
repeated
sponge
again
my
dear
fellow
you
know
it
observed
jawleyford
suppose
it
meant
for
you
at
last
replied
sponge
seeing
his
anxiety
my
dear
fellow
why
do
you
think
it
like
there
a
resemblance
certainly
said
sponge
that
one
knows
but
i
should
have
guessed
it
was
you
my
dear
mr
sponge
exclaimed
jawleyford
in
a
tone
of
mortification
you
mean
to
say
you
do
think
it
like
yes
it
like
replied
sponge
seeing
which
way
his
host
wanted
it
like
certainly
the
want
of
expression
in
the
eye
makes
such
a
difference
between
a
bust
and
a
picture
replied
jawleyford
comforted
repeated
he
looking
affectionately
at
it
should
say
it
was
very
like
like
as
anything
can
be
you
are
rather
too
much
above
it
there
you
see
sit
down
here
continued
he
leading
sponge
to
an
ottoman
surrounding
a
huge
model
of
the
column
in
the
place
vendôme
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
down
here
now
and
look
and
say
if
you
do
think
it
like
illustration
of
course
you
know
like
replied
sponge
as
soon
as
he
had
seated
himself
see
it
now
directly
the
mouth
is
yours
to
a
the
chin
it
my
chin
is
it
asked
jawleyford
and
the
nose
and
the
forehead
and
the
whiskers
and
the
hair
and
the
shape
of
the
head
and
everything
oh
i
see
it
now
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
observed
sponge
thought
you
would
rejoined
jawleyford
comforted
thought
you
would
it
generally
considered
an
excellent
likeness
so
it
should
indeed
for
it
cost
a
vast
of
money
fifty
guineas
to
say
nothing
of
the
pedestal
it
on
that
another
of
me
continued
jawleyford
pointing
to
a
bust
above
the
fireplace
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gallery
some
years
since
ten
or
twelve
at
least
not
so
like
as
this
but
still
like
that
portrait
up
there
just
above
the
finding
of
moses
by
poussin
pointing
to
a
portrait
of
himself
attitudinizing
with
his
hand
on
his
hip
and
well
thrown
back
so
as
to
show
his
figure
and
the
silk
lining
to
advantage
done
the
other
day
by
a
very
rising
young
artist
though
he
has
hardly
done
me
justice
perhaps
particularly
in
the
nose
which
he
made
far
too
thick
and
heavy
and
the
right
hand
if
anything
is
rather
clumsy
otherwise
the
colouring
is
good
and
there
is
a
considerable
deal
of
taste
in
the
arrangement
of
the
background
and
so
on
book
is
it
you
are
pointing
to
asked
sponge
not
a
book
replied
jawleyford
a
plan
a
plan
of
this
gallery
in
fact
i
am
supposed
to
be
giving
the
final
order
for
the
erection
of
the
very
edifice
we
are
now
in
a
very
handsome
building
it
is
observed
sponge
thinking
he
would
make
it
a
when
he
got
it
it
a
handsome
thing
in
its
way
assented
jawleyford
if
it
had
been
perhaps
added
he
as
a
big
drop
splashed
upon
the
crown
of
his
head
contents
must
be
very
valuable
observed
sponge
valuable
replied
jawleyford
a
thing
i
gave
two
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
for
that
vase
it
of
parian
marble
of
the
cinque
cento
period
beautifully
sculptured
in
a
dance
of
bacchanals
arabesques
and
chimera
figures
it
was
considered

festoons
of
grapes
and

which
surround
the
neck
of

subjects
painted
in
the
highest
style
nothing
can
be
more
beautiful
or
more
chaste
assented
sponge
pictures
i
should
think
are
most
valuable
observed
jawleyford
friend
lord
sparklebury
said
to
me
the
last
time
he
was
here
he
now
in
italy
increasing
his
collection
jawleyford
old
boy
said
he
for
we
are
very
intimate
just
like
brothers
in
fact
jawleyford
old
boy
i
wonder
whether
your
collection
or
mine
would
fetch
most
money
if
they
were
oh
your
lordship
said
i
your
guidos
and
ostades
and
poussins
and
velasquez
are
not
to
be
surpassed
true
replied
his
lordship
they
are
fine
very
fine
but
you
have
the
murillos
i
like
to
give
you
a
good
round
sum
added
he
to
pick
out
pictures
out
of
your
gallery
do
you
understand
pictures
continued
jawleyford
turning
short
on
his
friend
sponge
little
replied
sponge
in
a
tone
that
might
mean
either
yes
or
no
a
great
deal
or
nothing
at
all
jawleyford
then
took
him
and
worked
him
through
his
collection
talked
of
light
and
shade
and
tone
and
depth
of
colouring
tints
and
pencillings
and
put
sponge
here
and
there
and
everywhere
to
catch
the
light
or
rain
as
the
case
might
be
made
him
convert
his
hand
into
an
and
occasionally
put
his
head
between
his
legs
to
get
an
view
a
feat
that
sponge
equestrian
experience
made
him
pretty
well
up
to
so
they
looked
and
admired
and
criticized
till
spigot
figure
came
looming
up
the
gallery
and
announced
that
luncheon
was
ready
me
exclaimed
jawleyford
pulling
a
most
diminutive
geneva
watch
hung
with
pencils
and
other
curiosities
out
of
his
pocket
me
who
have
thought
it
one
i
declare
well
if
this
does
prove
the
value
of
a
gallery
on
a
wet
day
i
do
know
what
does
however
said
he
must
tear
ourselves
away
for
the
present
and
go
and
see
what
the
ladies
are
about
if
ever
a
man
may
be
excused
for
indulging
in
luncheon
it
certainly
is
on
a
pouring
wet
day
when
he
eats
for
occupation
or
when
he
is
making
love
both
which
excuses
sponge
had
to
offer
so
he
just
sat
down
and
ate
as
heartily
as
the
best
of
the
party
not
excepting
his
host
himself
who
was
an
excellent
hand
at
luncheon
jawleyford
tried
to
get
him
back
to
the
gallery
after
luncheon
but
a
look
from
his
wife
intimated
that
sponge
was
wanted
elsewhere
so
he
quietly
saw
him
carried
off
to
the
and
presently
the
notes
of
the
piano
and
full
clear
voices
of
his
daughters
echoing
along
the
passage
intimated
that
they
were
trying
what
effect
music
would
have
upon
him
when
jawleyford
looked
in
about
an
hour
after
she
found
sponge
sitting
over
the
fire
with
his
in
his
hand
and
the
young
ladies
with
their
laps
full
of
keeping
up
a
sort
of
crossfire
of
conversation
in
the
shape
of
question
and
answer
jawleyford
company
making
matters
worse
they
soon
became
tediously
agreeable
in
course
of
time
jawleyford
entered
the
room
with
dear
sponge
your
groom
has
come
up
to
know
about
your
horse
i
told
him
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
think
of
hunting
but
he
says
he
must
have
his
orders
from
you
i
should
say
added
jawleyford
is
out
of
the
question
madness
to
think
of
it
much
better
in
the
house
such
weather
do
know
that
replied
sponge
rain
come
down
and
though
the
country
will
ride
heavy
i
do
see
why
we
should
have
sport
after
it
the
glass
is
falling
and
the
wind
gone
round
the
wrong
way
the
moon
changed
this
morning
everything
in
short
indicates
continued
wet
replied
jawleyford
rivers
are
all
swollen
and
the
low
grounds
under
water
besides
my
dear
fellow
consider
the
distance
consider
the
distance
sixteen
miles
if
it
a
yard
dundleton
tower
exclaimed
sponge
recollecting
that
jawleyford
had
said
it
was
only
ten
the
night
before
miles
and
bad
road
replied
jawleyford
deuce
it
is
muttered
sponge
adding
i
go
and
see
my
groom
at
all
events
so
saying
he
rang
the
bell
as
if
the
house
was
his
own
and
desired
spigot
to
show
him
the
way
to
his
servant
leather
of
course
was
in
the
servants
hall
refreshing
himself
with
cold
meat
and
ale
after
his
ride
up
from
lucksford
finding
that
he
had
ridden
the
hack
up
he
desired
leather
to
leave
him
there
the
groom
i
have
him
put
up
said
sponge
you
ride
the
chestnut
on
in
the
morning
how
far
is
it
to
dundleton
tower
asked
he
or
thirteen
miles
they
say
from
here
replied
leather
or
ten
from
lucksford
that
do
said
sponge
tell
the
groom
here
to
have
the
hack
saddled
for
me
at
nine
and
you
ride
multum
in
parvo
quietly
on
either
to
the
meet
or
till
i
overtake
you
how
am
i
to
get
back
to
lucksford
asked
leather
cocking
up
a
foot
to
show
how
thinly
he
was
shod
just
as
you
can
replied
sponge
the
groom
here
to
set
you
down
with
his
master
hacks
i
dare
say
they
have
been
out
and
do
them
good
so
saying
sponge
left
his
valuable
servant
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
himself
having
returned
to
the
with
the
aid
of
an
old
county
map
sponge
proceeded
to
trace
his
way
to
dundleton
tower
aided
or
rather
retarded
by
jawleyford
who
kept
pointing
out
all
sorts
of
difficulties
till
if
sponge
had
followed
his
advice
he
would
have
made
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
of
the
distance
sponge
however
being
used
to
scramble
about
strange
countries
saw
the
place
was
to
be
accomplished
in
ten
or
eleven
jawleyford
was
sure
he
would
lose
himself
and
sponge
was
equally
confident
that
he
would
at
length
the
glad
sound
of
the
gong
put
an
end
to
all
further
argument
and
the
inmates
of
jawleyford
court
retired
candle
in
hand
to
their
respective
apartments
to
adorn
for
a
repetition
of
the
yesterday
spread
with
the
addition
of
the
rev
hobanob
company
to
say
grace
and
praise
the
an
appetiteless
dinner
was
succeeded
by
tea
and
music
as
before
the
three
elegant
french
clocks
in
the
being
at
variance
one
being
of
an
hour
before
the
slowest
and
twenty
minutes
before
the
next
hobanob
much
to
the
horror
of
jawleyford
having
nearly
fallen
asleep
with
his
sèvres
in
his
hand
at
last
drew
up
his
great
silver
watch
by
its
and
finding
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
prepared
to
decamp
taking
as
affectionate
a
leave
of
the
ladies
as
if
he
had
been
going
to
china
he
was
followed
by
jawleyford
to
see
him
pocket
his
pumps
and
also
by
sponge
to
see
what
sort
of
a
night
it
was
the
sky
was
clear
stars
sparkled
in
the
firmament
and
a
young
crescent
moon
shone
with
silvery
brightness
the
scene
do
said
sponge
as
he
eyed
it
haze
there
come
added
he
to
his
as
hobanob
steps
died
out
on
the
terrace
better
go
replied
jawleyford
next
day
perhaps
scrambleford
green
better
place
much
you
may
lock
up
said
he
turning
to
spigot
who
with
both
footmen
was
in
attendance
to
see
hobanob
off
may
lock
up
and
tell
the
cook
to
have
breakfast
ready
at
nine
precisely
never
mind
about
breakfast
for
me
interposed
sponge
have
some
tea
or
coffee
and
chops
or
boiled
ham
and
eggs
or
whatever
going
in
my
bedroom
said
he
never
mind
altering
your
hour
for
me
but
my
dear
fellow
we
all
breakfast
together
jawleyford
had
no
notion
of
standing
two
breakfasts
all
breakfast
together
said
he
trouble
i
assure
you
rather
the
contrary
say
eight
eight
spigot
to
a
minute
mind
and
sponge
seeing
there
was
no
help
for
it
bid
the
ladies
good
night
and
tumbled
off
to
bed
with
little
expectation
of
punctuality

sponge
rapid
breakfast
chapter
xx
the
nor
was
sponge
wrong
in
his
conjecture
for
it
was
a
quarter
to
nine
ere
spigot
appeared
with
the
massive
silver
urn
followed
by
the
bold
bearing
the
heavy
implements
of
breakfast
then
though
the
young
ladies
were
punctual
smiling
and
affable
as
usual
jawleyford
was
absent
and
she
had
the
keys
so
it
was
nearly
nine
before
sponge
got
his
fork
into
his
first
mutton
chop
jawleyford
was
not
exactly
pleased
he
thought
it
did
look
well
for
a
young
man
to
prefer
hunting
to
the
society
of
his
lovely
and
accomplished
daughters
hunting
was
all
very
well
occasionally
but
it
did
not
do
to
make
a
business
of
it
this
however
he
kept
to
himself
have
a
fine
day
my
dear
sponge
said
he
extending
a
hand
as
he
found
our
friend
and
working
away
at
the
breakfast
said
sponge
munching
away
for
hard
life
in
less
than
ten
minutes
he
managed
to
get
as
much
down
as
with
the
aid
of
a
knotch
of
bread
that
he
pocketed
he
thought
would
last
him
through
the
day
and
with
a
hasty
adieu
he
hurried
off
to
find
the
stables
to
get
his
hack
the
piebald
was
saddled
bridled
and
turned
round
in
the
stall
for
all
servants
that
are
worth
anything
like
to
further
hunting
operations
with
the
aid
of
the
groom
instructions
who
accompanied
him
out
of
the
courtyard
sponge
was
enabled
to
set
off
at
a
hard
canter
cheered
by
the
groom
observation
that
thought
he
would
be
there
in
time
on
on
he
went
now
speculating
on
a
turn
now
pulling
a
scratch
map
he
had
made
on
a
bit
of
paper
out
of
his
now
inquiring
the
name
of
any
place
he
saw
of
any
person
he
met
so
he
proceeded
for
five
or
six
miles
without
much
difficulty
the
road
though
not
all
turnpike
being
mainly
over
good
sound
township
ones
it
was
at
the
village
of
swineley
with
its
church
and
miserable
cottages
that
his
troubles
were
to
begin
he
had
two
sharp
turns
to
make
to
ride
through
a
and
leap
over
a
wall
at
the
corner
of
a
cottage
to
get
into
swaithing
green
lane
and
so
cut
off
an
angle
of
two
miles
the
road
then
became
a
bridle
one
and
was
like
all
bridle
ones
very
plain
to
those
who
know
them
and
very
puzzling
to
those
who
do
it
was
evidently
a
road
and
what
with
looking
out
for
footmarks
now
nearly
obliterated
by
the
recent
rains
and
speculating
on
what
queer
corners
of
the
fields
the
gates
would
be
in
sponge
found
it
necessary
to
reduce
his
pace
to
a
very
moderate
trot
still
he
had
made
good
way
and
supposing
they
gave
a
law
and
he
had
not
been
deceived
as
to
distance
he
thought
he
should
get
to
the
meet
about
the
time
his
horse
too
would
be
there
and
perhaps
lord
scamperdale
might
give
a
little
extra
law
on
that
account
he
then
began
speculating
on
what
sort
of
a
man
his
lordship
was
and
the
probable
nature
of
his
reception
he
began
to
wish
that
jawleyford
had
accompanied
him
to
introduce
him
not
that
sponge
was
shy
but
still
he
thought
that
jawleyford
presence
would
do
him
good
lord
scamperdale
hunt
was
not
the
most
polished
in
the
world
the
hounds
and
the
horses
were
a
good
deal
better
bred
than
the
men
of
course
his
lordship
gave
the
to
the
whole
and
being
a
coarse
broad
sort
of
man
he
had
his
clothes
to
correspond
and
looked
like
a
drayman
in
scarlet
he
wore
a
great
round
hat
which
being
adopted
by
the
hunt
generally
procured
it
the
name
of
the
or
hat
hunt
our
readers
we
dare
say
have
noticed
it
figuring
away
in
the
list
of
hounds
during
the
winter
along
with
the
and
other
initialized
packs
his
lordship
clothes
were
of
the
large
roomy
baggy
abundant
order
with
great
pockets
great
buttons
and
lots
of
strings
flying
out
instead
of
tops
he
sported
leather
leggings
which
at
a
distance
gave
him
the
appearance
of
riding
with
his
trousers
up
to
his
knees
these
the
hunt
too
adopted
and
his
jack
jack
spraggon
the
man
whom
he
mounted
and
who
was
made
much
in
his
own
mould
sported
like
his
patron
a
pair
of
great
spectacles
of
considerable
power
jack
was
always
at
his
lordship
elbow
and
it
was
this
that
something
all
day
long
but
we
must
return
to
sponge
whom
we
left
working
his
way
through
the
intricate
fields
at
last
he
got
through
them
and
into
red
pool
common
which
by
leaving
the
windmill
to
the
right
he
cleared
pretty
cleverly
and
entered
upon
a
district
still
wilder
and
drearier
than
any
he
had
traversed
peewits
screamed
and
hovered
over
land
that
seemed
to
grow
little
but
rushes
and
with
occasional
heather
the
ground
poached
and
splashed
as
he
went
worst
of
all
time
was
nearly
up
in
vain
sponge
strained
his
eyes
in
search
of
dundleton
tower
in
vain
he
fancied
every
high
place
in
the
distance
was
the
spot
dundleton
tower
was
no
more
a
tower
than
it
was
a
town
and
would
seem
to
have
been
christened
by
the
rule
of
contrary
for
it
was
nothing
but
a
great
flat
open
space
without
object
or
incident
to
note
it
sponge
however
was
not
destined
to
see
it
as
he
went
floundering
along
through
an
apparently
interminable
and
almost
bottomless
lane
whose
sunken
places
and
deep
ruts
were
filled
with
clayey
water
which
played
the
very
deuce
with
the
cords
and
brown
boots
the
light
note
of
a
hound
fell
on
his
ear
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
something
that
he
would
have
taken
for
a
dog
had
it
not
been
for
the
note
of
the
hound
turned
as
it
were
from
him
and
went
in
a
contrary
direction
sponge
reined
in
the
piebald
and
stood
transfixed
it
was
indeed
the
fox
a
magnificent
fellow
with
a
slight
tendency
to
grey
along
the
back
and
going
with
the
light
spiry
ease
of
an
animal
full
of
strength
and
running
wish
i
may
ketch
it
said
sponge
to
himself
shuddering
at
the
idea
of
having
headed
him
it
was
however
no
time
for
thinking
the
cry
of
hounds
became
more
distinct
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
fuller
and
more
melodious
but
alas
it
was
no
music
to
sponge
presently
the
cheering
of
hunters
was
heard
for
and
anon
the
rate
of
a
whip
farther
back
another
second
and
hounds
horses
and
men
were
in
view
streaming
away
over
the
large
pasture
on
the
left
there
was
a
high
straggling
fence
between
sponge
and
the
field
thick
enough
to
prevent
their
identifying
him
but
not
sufficiently
high
to
screen
him
altogether
sponge
pulled
round
the
piebald
and
gathered
himself
together
like
a
man
going
to
be
shot
the
hounds
came
tearing
full
cry
to
where
he
was
there
was
a
scent
and
every
one
seemed
to
have
it
they
charged
the
fence
at
a
wattled
pace
a
few
yards
below
where
he
sat
and
flying
across
the
deep
dirty
lane
dashed
full
cry
into
the
pasture
beyond
back
cried
sponge
back
trying
to
turn
them
but
instead
of
the
piebald
carrying
him
in
front
of
the
pack
as
sponge
wanted
he
took
to
rearing
and
plunging
and
pawing
the
air
the
hounds
meanwhile
dashed
jealously
on
without
a
scent
till
first
one
and
then
another
feeling
ashamed
gave
in
and
at
last
a
general
lull
succeeded
the
recent
joyous
cry
awful
period
terrible
to
any
one
but
dreadful
to
a
stranger
though
sponge
was
in
the
road
he
well
knew
that
no
one
has
any
business
anywhere
but
with
hounds
when
a
fox
is
astir
hard
was
now
the
cry
and
the
perspiring
riders
and
lathered
steeds
came
to
a
standstill
twang
twang
went
a
shrill
horn
and
a
couple
of
whips
singling
themselves
out
from
the
field
flew
over
the
fence
to
where
the
hounds
were
casting
twang
twang
went
the
horn
again
meanwhile
sponge
sat
enjoying
the
following
observations
which
a
westerly
wind
wafted
into
his
ear
d
n
me
that
man
in
the
lane
headed
the
fox
puffed
one
is
it
gasped
another
washball
exclaimed
a
third
more
foxes
than
any
man
in
the
country
puffed
a
fourth
nicking
and
skirting
exclaimed
a
fifth
comes
to
the
meet
added
a
sixth
on
a
cow
observed
another
chopping
and
changing
added
another
come
on
a
giraffe
next
having
commenced
his
career
with
the
so
inauspiciously
and
yet
escaped
detection
sponge
thought
of
letting
tom
washball
enjoy
the
honours
of
his
and
of
sneaking
quietly
home
as
soon
as
the
hounds
hit
off
the
scent
but
unluckily
just
as
they
were
crossing
the
lane
what
should
heave
in
sight
cantering
along
at
his
leisure
but
the
redoubtable
multum
in
parvo
who
having
got
rid
of
old
leather
by
bumping
and
thumping
his
leg
against
a
was
enjoying
a
line
of
his
own
cried
sponge
as
he
saw
the
horse
quickening
his
pace
to
have
a
shy
at
the
hounds
as
they
crossed
o
a
y
roared
he
brandishing
his
whip
and
trying
to
turn
the
piebald
round
but
no
the
brute
answer
the
bit
and
dreading
lest
in
addition
to
heading
the
fox
he
should
kill
best
hound
in
the
pack
sponge
threw
himself
off
regardless
of
the
in
which
he
lit
and
caught
the
runaway
as
he
tried
to
dart
past
was
again
the
cry
as
the
hounds
hit
off
the
scent
while
the
late
pausing
panting
sportsmen
tackled
vigorously
with
their
steeds
and
swept
onward
like
the
careering
wind
sponge
albeit
somewhat
perplexed
had
still
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
see
the
necessity
of
immediate
action
and
though
he
had
so
lately
contemplated
beating
a
retreat
the
unexpected
appearance
of
parvo
altered
the
state
of
affairs
or
never
said
he
looking
first
at
the
disappearing
field
and
then
for
the
leather
it
i
may
as
well
see
the
run
added
he
so
hooking
the
piebald
on
to
an
old
stone
that
stood
in
the
ragged
fence
and
lengthening
a
he
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
began
lengthening
the
other
as
he
went
it
was
one
of
parvo
going
days
indeed
it
was
that
that
old
leather
and
he
had
quarrelled
about
parvo
wanting
to
follow
the
hounds
while
leather
wanted
to
wait
for
his
master
and
parvo
had
the
knack
of
going
as
well
as
the
occasional
inclination
although
such
a
animal
he
could
throw
the
ground
behind
him
amazingly
and
the
clay
in
which
he
now
found
himself
was
admirably
suited
to
his
short
powerful
legs
and
enormous
stride
the
consequence
was
that
he
was
very
soon
up
with
the
hindmost
horsemen
these
he
soon
passed
and
was
presently
among
those
who
ride
hard
when
there
is
nothing
to
stop
them
such
time
as
these
sportsmen
could
now
spare
from
looking
out
ahead
was
devoted
to
sponge
whom
they
eyed
with
the
utmost
astonishment
as
if
he
had
dropped
from
the
clouds
a
stranger
a
real
stranger
had
not
visited
their
remote
regions
since
the
days
of
poor
nimrod
could
it
be
but
pace
as
nimrod
used
to
say
too
good
to
inquire
a
little
farther
on
and
sponge
drew
upon
the
great
guns
of
the
hunt
the
men
who
ride
hounds
and
not
them
the
same
who
had
criticized
him
through
the
fence
wake
fossick
parson
blossomnose
fyle
lord
scamperdale
jack
himself
and
others
great
was
their
astonishment
at
the
apparition
and
incoherent
the
observations
they
dropped
as
they
galloped
on
is
wash
after
all
whispered
fyle
into
blossomnose
ear
as
they
rode
through
a
gate
together
replied
the
nose
eyeing
sponge
intently
a
coat
whispered
one
replied
the
other
his
brush
observed
a
third
winking
at
sponge
docked
tail
going
to
ride
over
us
all
snapped
fossick
whom
sponge
passed
at
a
as
the
former
was
blobbing
and
floundering
about
the
deep
ruts
leading
out
of
a
catch
it
just
now
said
wake
eyeing
sponge
drawing
upon
his
lordship
and
jack
as
they
led
the
field
as
usual
jack
being
at
a
respectful
distance
behind
his
great
patron
espied
sponge
first
and
having
taken
a
good
stare
at
him
through
his
formidable
spectacles
to
satisfy
himself
that
it
was
nobody
he
knew
a
stare
that
sponge
returned
as
well
as
a
man
without
spectacles
can
return
the
stare
of
one
with
jack
spurred
his
horse
up
to
his
lordship
and
rising
in
his
stirrups
shot
into
his
ear
here
the
man
on
the
cow
adding
is
washey
the
deuce
is
it
then
asked
his
lordship
looking
over
his
left
shoulder
as
he
kept
galloping
on
in
the
wake
of
his
huntsman
know
replied
jack
saw
him
before
i
said
his
lordship
with
an
air
as
much
as
to
say
makes
no
matter
his
lordship
though
well
mounted
was
not
exactly
on
the
sort
of
horse
for
the
country
they
were
in
while
sponge
in
addition
to
being
on
the
very
animal
for
it
had
the
advantage
of
the
horse
having
gone
the
first
part
of
the
run
without
a
rider
so
multum
in
parvo
whether
sponge
wished
it
or
not
insisted
on
being
as
far
forward
as
he
could
get
the
more
sponge
pulled
and
hauled
the
more
determined
the
horse
was
till
having
thrown
both
jack
and
his
lordship
in
the
rear
he
made
for
old
frostyface
the
huntsman
who
was
riding
well
up
to
the
pack
hard
sir
for
god
sake
hold
hard
screamed
frosty
who
knew
by
intuition
there
was
a
horse
behind
as
well
as
he
knew
there
was
a
man
shooting
in
front
who
in
all
probability
had
headed
the
fox
hard
sir
roared
he
as
yawning
and
boring
and
shaking
his
head
parvo
dashed
through
the
now
yelping
scattered
pack
making
straight
for
a
stiff
new
gate
which
he
smashed
through
just
as
a
circus
pony
smashes
through
a
paper
hoop
shouted
jack
spraggon
on
seeing
the
hounds
were
safe
for
the
tailor
button
himself
exclaimed
his
lordship
adding
saw
such
a
thing
in
my
life
the
deuce
is
he
asked
blossomnose
in
the
full
glow
of
exertion
know
replied
jack
adding
a
shaver
whoever
he
is
meanwhile
the
frightened
hounds
were
scattered
right
and
left
lay
a
guinea
he
one
of
those
confounded
waiting
chaps
observed
fyle
who
had
been
handled
rather
roughly
by
one
of
the
tribe
who
had
dropped
promiscuously
upon
a
field
where
he
was
just
as
sponge
had
done
with
lord
scamperdale
wonder
replied
his
lordship
eyeing
sponge
vain
endeavours
to
turn
the
chestnut
and
thinking
how
he
would
into
him
when
he
came
up
jove
added
his
lordship
the
fellow
had
taken
the
whole
country
round
he
could
have
chosen
a
worse
spot
for
such
an
exploit
for
there
never
any
scent
over
here
see
not
a
hound
can
own
it
old
harmony
herself
throws
up
the
whips
again
are
in
their
places
turning
the
astonished
pack
to
frostyface
who
sets
off
on
a
casting
expedition
the
field
as
usual
sit
looking
on
some
blessing
sponge
some
wondering
who
he
was
others
looking
what
it
is
some
dismounting
and
looking
at
their
horses
feet
you
brown
boots
exclaimed
his
lordship
as
by
dint
of
bitting
and
spurring
sponge
at
length
worked
the
beast
round
and
came
sneaking
back
in
the
face
of
the
whole
field
you
brown
boots
repeated
he
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
very
low
much
to
you
brown
boots
most
particklarly
to
you
brown
boots
with
another
low
bow
to
you
brown

d

continued
his
lordship
looking
at
sponge
as
if
he
would
eat
him

screamed
his

continued
his
lordship
pointing
to
the
mute

saying

roared
home

undertone

chapter
xxi
a
country
illustration
what
sport
asked
jawleyford
as
he
encountered
his
exceedingly
dirty
friend
crossing
the
entrance
hall
to
his
bedroom
on
his
return
from
his
day
or
rather
his
with
the
hat
hunt
not
much
that
to
say
nothing
particular
i
mean
i
not
had
any
blurted
sponge
you
had
a
run
observed
jawleyford
pointing
to
his
boots
and
breeches
stained
with
the
variation
of
each
soil
i
got
most
of
that
going
to
cover
replied
sponge
awfully
deep
roads
abominably
dirty
adding
wish
i
taken
your
advice
and
stayed
at
home
wish
you
had
replied
jawleyford
have
had
a
most
excellent
for
luncheon
however
get
changed
and
we
will
hear
all
about
it
after
so
saying
jawleyford
waved
an
adieu
and
sponge
stamped
away
in
his
dirty
boots
afraid
you
are
very
wet
sponge
observed
amelia
in
the
sweetest
tone
with
the
most
loving
smile
possible
as
our
friend
with
three
steps
at
a
time
bounded
upstairs
and
nearly
butted
her
on
the
landing
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
coming
down
am
that
exclaimed
sponge
delighted
at
the
greeting
am
that
repeated
he
slapping
his
cords
too
added
he
looking
down
at
his
nether
man
you
better
get
changed
as
quick
as
possible
asked
amelia
still
keeping
her
position
before
him
all
in
good
time
replied
sponge
in
good
time
the
sight
of
you
warms
me
more
than
a
fire
would
do
adding
declare
you
look
quite
bewitching
after
all
the
roughings
and
tumblings
about
out
of
doors
you
not
had
a
fall
have
you
exclaimed
amelia
looking
the
picture
of
despair
not
had
a
fall
have
you
do
send
for
the
doctor
and
be
bled
just
then
a
door
along
the
passage
to
the
left
opened
and
amelia
knowing
pretty
well
who
it
was
smiled
and
tripped
away
leaving
sponge
to
be
bled
or
not
as
he
thought
proper
our
hero
then
made
for
his
bedroom
where
having
sucked
off
his
adhesive
boots
and
divested
himself
of
the
rest
of
his
hunting
attire
he
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
grey
flannel
and
prepared
for
parboiling
his
legs
and
feet
amid
agreeable
anticipations
arising
out
of
the
recent
interview
and
occasional
references
to
his
old
friend
whenever
he
did
not
see
his
way
on
the
matrimonial
road
as
clearly
as
he
could
wish
have
me
that
certain
observed
he
the
water
how
hot
it
is
exclaimed
he
catching
his
foot
up
out
of
the
bath
into
which
he
had
incautiously
plunged
it
without
ascertaining
the
temperature
of
the
water
he
then
sluiced
it
with
cold
and
next
had
to
add
a
little
more
hot
at
last
he
got
it
to
his
mind
and
lighting
a
cigar
prepared
for
uninterrupted
enjoyment
said
he
by
no
means
a
girl
whiff
girl
puff
head
and
neck
and
carries
it
well
puff
eye
whiff
and
clear
puff
cataracts
there
she
all
good
together
whiff
puff
whiff
size
too
continued
he
well
set
up
whiff
puff
whiff
as
a
dairy
maid
puff
of
substance
grand
thing
substance
puff
a
weedy
woman
fifteen
two
and
a
half
that
to
say
five
feet
four
plenty
of
height
for
a
woman
puff
of
a
woman
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
size
whiff
she
had
run
off
puff
like
to
have
had
a
little
more
talk
with
her
whiff
puff
never
look
so
well
as
when
one
comes
in
wet
and
dirty
from
hunting
puff
he
then
sank
silently
back
in
the
and
whiffed
and
puffed
all
sorts
of
fantastic
clouds
and
columns
and
corkscrews
at
his
leisure
the
cigar
being
finished
and
the
water
in
the
beginning
to
get
cool
he
emptied
the
remainder
of
the
hot
into
it
and
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
began
speculating
on
how
the
match
was
to
be
accomplished
the
lady
was
safe
that
was
clear
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
that
he
would
do
in
the
evening
or
in
the
morning
or
any
time
a
man
living
in
the
house
with
a
girl
need
never
be
in
want
of
an
opportunity
that
preliminary
over
and
the
usual
answer
papa
obtained
then
came
the
question
how
was
the
old
boy
to
be
managed
for
men
with
marriageable
daughters
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
boys
be
their
ages
what
they
may
he
became
lost
in
reflection
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
jawleyford
portrait
above
the
mantelpiece
wondering
whether
he
was
the
amiable
liberal
hearty
disinterested
sort
of
man
he
appeared
to
be
indifferent
about
money
and
only
wanting
unexceptionable
young
men
for
his
daughters
or
if
he
was
a
worldly
minded
man
like
some
he
had
met
who
after
giving
him
every
possible
encouragement
sent
him
to
the
like
a
servant
so
sponge
smoked
and
thought
and
thought
and
smoked
till
the
water
in
the
again
getting
cold
and
the
shades
of
night
drawing
on
he
at
last
started
up
like
a
man
determined
to
awake
himself
and
poking
a
match
into
the
fire
lighted
the
candles
on
the
and
proceeded
to
adorn
himself
having
again
got
himself
into
the
killing
tights
and
buckled
pumps
with
a
fine
shirt
ere
he
embarked
on
the
delicacies
and
difficulties
of
the
starcher
he
stirred
the
little
pittance
of
a
fire
and
folding
himself
in
his
endeavoured
to
prepare
his
mind
for
the
calm
consideration
of
all
the
minute
bearings
of
the
question
by
a
little
more
in
idea
he
transferred
himself
to
london
now
fancying
himself
standing
at
the
end
of
burlington
arcade
hailing
a
fulham
or
turnham
green
now
wrangling
with
a
conductor
for
charging
him
sixpence
when
there
was
a
pennant
flapping
at
his
nose
with
the
words
all
the
way
upon
it
now
folding
the
wooden
doors
of
a
hansom
cab
in
oxford
street
calculating
the
extreme
distance
he
could
go
for
an
eightpenny
fare
until
at
last
he
fell
into
a
downright
vacant
sort
of
reading
without
rhyme
or
reason
just
as
one
sometimes
takes
a
read
of
a
directory
or
a
dictionary
conduit
street
george
street
to
or
from
the
adelphi
terrace
astley
amphitheatre
baker
street
king
street
bryanston
square
any
part
covent
garden
theatre
foundling
hospital
hatton
garden
and
so
on
till
the
thunder
of
the
gong
aroused
him
to
a
recollection
of
his
duties
he
then
up
and
at
his
neckcloth
ah
well
said
he
reverting
to
his
lady
love
as
he
eyed
himself
intently
in
the
glass
while
performing
the
critical
operation
i
just
sound
the
old
gentleman
after
dinner
one
can
do
that
sort
of
thing
better
over
one
wine
perhaps
than
at
any
other
time
looks
less
formal
too
added
he
giving
the
cravat
a
knowing
crease
at
the
side
and
if
it
does
seem
to
take
one
can
just
pass
it
off
as
if
it
was
done
for
somebody
else
some
young
gentleman
at
laverick
wells
for
instance
so
saying
he
on
with
his
white
waistcoat
and
crowned
the
conquering
suit
with
a
blue
coat
and
metal
buttons
returning
his
to
his
pocket
he
blew
out
the
candles
and
groped
his
way
downstairs
in
the
dark
in
passing
the
he
looked
in
to
see
if
there
were
any
set
we
believe
when
he
saw
that
he
should
not
have
an
opportunity
of
sounding
his
intended
after
dinner
for
he
found
the
table
laid
for
twelve
and
a
great
display
of
plate
linen
and
china
he
then
swaggered
on
to
the
which
was
in
a
blaze
of
light
the
lively
emily
had
stolen
a
march
on
her
sister
and
had
just
entered
attired
in
a
fine
new
pale
yellow
silk
dress
with
a
berthe
and
other
adornments
high
words
had
ensued
between
the
sisters
as
to
the
meanness
of
amelia
in
trying
to
take
her
beau
from
her
especially
after
the
airs
amelia
had
given
herself
respecting
sponge
and
a
minute
observer
might
have
seen
the
slight
tinge
of
red
on
emily
eyelids
denoting
the
usual
issue
of
such
scenes
the
result
was
that
each
determined
to
do
the
best
she
could
for
herself
and
free
trade
being
proclaimed
emily
proceeded
to
dress
with
all
expedition
calculating
that
as
sponge
had
come
in
wet
he
would
very
likely
dress
at
once
and
appear
in
the
in
good
time
nor
was
she
out
in
her
reckoning
for
she
had
hardly
enjoyed
an
approving
glance
in
the
mirror
ere
our
hero
came
swaggering
in
twitching
his
arms
as
if
he
had
got
his
wristbands
adjusted
and
working
his
legs
as
if
they
belong
to
him
ah
my
dear
miss
emley
exclaimed
he
advancing
gaily
towards
her
with
extended
hand
which
she
took
with
all
the
pleasure
in
the
world
adding
and
how
have
you
been
oh
pretty
well
thank
you
replied
she
looking
as
though
she
would
have
said
as
well
as
i
can
be
without
you
sponge
though
a
consummate
judge
of
a
horse
and
all
the
minutiae
connected
with
them
was
still
rather
green
in
the
matter
of
woman
and
having
settled
in
his
own
mind
that
amelia
should
be
his
choice
he
concluded
that
emily
knew
all
about
it
and
was
working
on
her
account
instead
of
doing
the
agreeable
for
herself
and
there
it
is
where
elder
sisters
have
such
an
advantage
over
younger
ones
they
are
always
shown
or
contrive
to
show
themselves
first
and
if
a
man
once
makes
up
his
mind
that
the
elder
one
will
do
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
and
it
is
neither
a
deeper
shade
or
two
of
blue
nor
a
brighter
tinge
of
brown
nor
a
little
smaller
foot
nor
a
more
elegant
waist
that
will
make
him
change
for
a
younger
sister
the
younger
ones
immediately
become
sisters
in
the
men
minds
and
retire
or
are
retired
from
the
field
scratched
as
sponge
would
say
amelia
however
was
not
going
to
give
emily
a
chance
for
having
dressed
with
all
the
expedition
compatible
with
an
attractive
toilet
a
satin
with
broad
black
lace
flounces
and
some
heavy
jewellery
on
her
arms
she
came
sidling
in
so
gently
as
almost
to
catch
emily
in
the
act
of
playing
the
agreeable
turning
the
sidle
into
a
stately
sail
with
a
haughty
sort
of
sneer
and
toss
of
the
head
to
her
sister
as
much
as
to
say
are
you
doing
with
my
man
a
sneer
that
suddenly
changed
into
a
sweet
smile
as
her
eye
encountered
sponge
she
just
motioned
him
off
to
a
sofa
where
she
commenced
a
conversation
in
the
style
illustration
sponge
and
the
misses
jawleyford
the
plot
then
began
to
thicken
first
came
jawleyford
in
a
terrible
stew
this
is
too
bad
exclaimed
he
stamping
and
flourishing
a
scented
note
with
a
crest
and
initials
at
the
top
is
too
bad
repeated
he
accepting
invitations
and
then
crying
off
at
the
last
moment
is
it
ca
come
papa
the
foozles
asked
emily
foozles
be
hanged
sneered
jawleyford
always
come
blossomnoses
replied
he
with
an
emphasis
blossomnoses
exclaimed
both
girls
clasping
their
hands
and
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
all
of
them
asked
emily
of
them
rejoined
jawleyford
that
four
observed
emily
be
sure
it
is
replied
jawleyford
if
you
count
them
by
appetites
for
old
blossom
always
eats
and
drinks
as
much
as
two
people
excuse
do
they
give
asked
amelia
taken
suddenly
ill
replied
jawleyford
if
that
any
excuse
when
there
are
within
half
a
dozen
miles
would
have
been
stopped
hunting
for
want
of
a
horse
i
dare
say
observed
amelia
dare
say
it
all
a
lie
observed
jawleyford
adding
the
invitation
shall
go
for
a
dinner
all
the
same
the
denunciation
was
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
spigot
who
came
looming
up
the
spacious
in
the
full
magnificence
of
black
shorts
silk
stockings
and
buckled
pumps
followed
by
a
red
young
gentleman
whom
he
announced
as
robert
foozle
robert
was
the
hope
of
the
house
of
foozle
and
it
was
fortunate
his
parents
were
satisfied
with
him
for
few
other
people
were
he
was
a
young
gentleman
who
shook
hands
with
everybody
assented
to
anything
that
anybody
said
and
in
answering
a
question
wherein
indeed
his
conversation
chiefly
consisted
he
always
followed
the
words
of
the
interrogation
as
much
as
he
could
for
instance
robert
have
you
been
at
dulverton
answer
i
not
been
at
dulverton
question
you
going
to
dulverton
answer
i
not
going
to
dulverton
having
shaken
hands
with
the
party
all
round
and
turned
to
the
fire
to
warm
his
red
fists
jawleyford
having
stood
at
for
such
time
as
he
thought
foozle
would
be
occupied
before
the
glass
in
his
study
arranging
her
and
seeing
no
symptoms
of
any
further
announcement
at
last
asked
foozle
if
his
papa
and
mamma
were
not
coming
my
papa
and
mamma
are
not
coming
replied
he
you
sure
asked
jawleyford
in
a
tone
of
excitement
sure
replied
foozle
in
the
most
voice
illustration
robert
foozle
deuce
exclaimed
jawleyford
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
soft
rug
adding
never
rains
but
it
pours
you
any
note
or
anything
asked
jawleyford
who
had
followed
robert
foozle
into
the
room
i
have
a
note
replied
he
diving
into
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
and
producing
one
the
note
was
a
letter
a
letter
from
foozle
to
jawleyford
three
sides
and
crossed
and
seeing
the
magnitude
thereof
jawleyford
quietly
put
it
into
her
reticule
observing
she
hoped
and
foozle
were
well
they
are
well
replied
robert
notwithstanding
he
had
express
orders
to
say
that
his
papa
had
the
toothache
and
his
mamma
the
earache
jawleyford
then
gave
a
furious
ring
at
the
bell
for
dinner
and
in
due
course
of
time
the
party
of
six
proceeded
to
a
table
for
twelve
sponge
pawned
jawleyford
off
upon
robert
foozle
which
gave
sponge
the
right
to
the
fair
amelia
who
walked
off
on
his
arm
with
a
toss
of
her
head
at
emily
as
though
she
thought
him
the
finest
sprightliest
man
under
the
sun
emily
followed
and
jawleyford
came
sulking
in
alone
sore
put
out
at
the
failure
of
what
he
meant
for
grand
entertainment
lights
blazed
in
profusion
lamps
more
accustomed
had
now
become
better
behaved
and
the
whole
strength
of
the
plate
was
called
in
requisition
sadly
puzzling
the
unfortunate
cook
to
find
something
to
put
upon
the
dishes
she
however
was
a
real
woman
who
would
undertake
to
cook
a
lord
mayor
feast
soups
sweets
joints
entrées
and
all
jawleyford
was
nearly
silent
during
the
dinner
indeed
he
was
too
far
off
for
conversation
had
there
been
any
for
him
to
join
in
which
was
not
the
case
for
amelia
and
sponge
kept
up
a
hum
of
words
while
emily
worked
robert
foozle
with
question
and
answer
such
as
were
your
sisters
out
yes
my
sisters
were
out
are
your
sisters
going
to
the
christmas
ball
yes
my
sisters
are
going
to
the
christmas
ball
still
nearly
daft
as
robert
was
he
was
generally
asked
where
there
was
anything
going
on
and
more
than
one
young
la
but
we
will
not
tell
about
that
as
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
story
by
the
time
the
ladies
took
their
departure
jawleyford
had
somewhat
recovered
from
the
annoyance
of
his
disappointment
and
as
they
retired
he
rang
the
bell
and
desired
spigot
to
set
in
the
table
and
bring
a
bottle
of
the
green
seal
being
the
colour
affixed
on
the
bottles
of
a
hamper
of
port
curious
old
port
at
that
had
arrived
from
wintle
by
rail
goods
train
of
course
that
morning
there
exclaimed
jawleyford
as
spigot
placed
the
richly
cut
decanter
on
the
table
there
repeated
he
drawing
the
green
curtain
as
if
to
shade
it
from
the
fire
but
in
reality
to
hide
the
dulness
the
recent
shaking
had
given
it
that
wine
said
he
is
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
bottle
at
the
very
least
observed
sponge
it
was
drunk
quarter
of
a
century
gaped
robert
foozle
of
a
century
if
it
a
day
replied
jawleyford
smacking
his
lips
as
he
set
down
his
glass
after
imbibing
the
precious
beverage
fine
observed
sponge
adding
as
he
sipped
off
his
glass
odd
to
find
such
old
wine
so
now
tell
us
all
about
your
day
proceedings
said
jawleyford
thinking
it
advisable
to
change
the
conversation
at
once
sport
had
you
with
my
lord
why
i
really
ca
tell
you
much
drawled
sponge
with
an
air
of
bewilderment
country
strange
faces
nobody
i
knew
and
true
replied
jawleyford
it
occurred
to
me
after
you
were
gone
that
perhaps
you
might
not
know
any
one
ours
you
see
is
rather
an
country
few
of
our
people
go
to
town
or
indeed
anywhere
else
they
are
all
birds
but
they
receive
you
with
great
politeness
i
sure
if
they
knew
you
came
from
here
at
least
added
he
sponge
was
silent
and
took
a
great
gulp
of
the
dull
to
save
himself
from
answering
my
lord
scamperdale
out
asked
jawleyford
seeing
he
was
not
going
to
get
a
reply
i
can
really
hardly
tell
you
that
replied
sponge
were
two
men
out
either
of
whom
might
be
him
at
least
they
both
seemed
to
take
the
lead
and
and
he
was
going
to
say
up
the
people
but
he
thought
he
might
as
well
keep
that
to
himself
men
dressed
much
alike
with
great
broad
spectacles
on
asked
jawleyford
so
replied
sponge
you
are
right
then
rejoined
jawleyford
would
be
my
lord
who
was
the
other
inquired
our
friend
that
jack
spraggon
replied
jawleyford
curling
up
his
nose
as
if
he
was
going
to
be
sick
of
the
most
odious
wretches
under
the
sun
i
really
do
know
any
man
that
i
have
so
great
a
dislike
to
so
utter
a
contempt
for
as
that
jack
as
they
call
him
is
he
asked
sponge
just
a
of
his
lordship
the
creature
has
nothing
nothing
whatever
he
lives
on
my
lord
eats
his
venison
drinks
his
claret
rides
his
horses
bullies
those
his
lordship
does
like
to
tackle
with
and
makes
himself
generally
useful
seems
a
man
of
that
sort
observed
sponge
as
he
thought
over
the
compliment
he
had
received
who
else
had
you
out
then
asked
jawleyford
tom
washball
there
replied
sponge
was
out
i
know
that
unfortunate
observed
jawleyford
helping
himself
and
passing
the
bottle
a
capital
fellow
a
perfect
gentleman
great
friend
of
mine
if
he
been
out
you
have
had
nothing
to
do
but
mention
my
name
and
he
have
put
you
all
right
in
a
minute
who
else
was
there
then
continued
he
was
a
tall
man
in
black
on
a
young
brown
horse
rather
rash
at
his
fences
but
a
fine
style
of
goer
exclaimed
jawleyford
in
drab
cords
and
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
rather
turning
upwards
so
replied
sponge
a
double
ribbon
for
a
master
blossomnose
observed
jawleyford
scarcely
able
to
contain
his
indignation
master
blossomnose
repeated
he
taking
a
back
hand
at
the
port
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
to
his
credit
if
he
were
to
stay
at
home
and
attend
to
his
parish
added
jawleyford
meaning
it
would
have
been
more
to
his
credit
if
he
had
fulfilled
his
engagement
to
him
that
evening
instead
of
going
out
hunting
in
the
morning
the
two
then
sat
silent
for
a
time
sponge
seeing
where
the
sore
place
was
and
robert
foozle
as
usual
seeing
nothing
well
observed
jawleyford
at
length
breaking
silence
was
unfortunate
you
went
this
morning
i
did
my
best
to
prevent
you
told
you
what
a
long
way
it
was
and
so
on
however
never
mind
we
will
put
all
right
his
lordship
i
sure
will
be
most
happy
to
see
you
so
help
yourself
continued
he
passing
the
we
will
drink
his
health
and
success
to
sponge
filled
a
bumper
and
drank
his
lordship
health
with
the
accompaniment
as
desired
and
turning
to
robert
foozle
who
was
doing
likewise
said
you
fond
of
hunting
i
fond
of
hunting
replied
foozle
you
hunt
you
know
robert
observed
jawleyford
i
do
hunt
replied
robert
the
seal
being
demolished
jawleyford
ordered
a
bottle
of
the
attributing
the
slight
discoloration
which
he
did
not
discover
until
they
had
nearly
finished
the
bottle
to
change
of
atmosphere
in
the
outer
cellar
sponge
tackled
vigorously
with
the
which
was
better
than
the
first
and
robert
foozle
drinking
as
he
spoke
by
pattern
kept
filling
away
much
to
jawleyford
dissatisfaction
who
was
compelled
to
order
a
third
during
the
progress
of
its
demolition
the
host
tongue
became
considerably
loosened
he
talked
of
hunting
and
the
charms
of
the
chase
of
the
good
fellowship
it
produced
and
expatiated
on
the
advantages
it
was
of
to
the
country
in
a
national
point
of
view
promoting
as
it
did
a
spirit
of
manly
enterprise
and
encouraging
our
unrivalled
breed
of
horses
both
of
which
he
looked
upon
as
national
objects
well
worthy
the
attention
of
enlightened
men
like
himself
jawleyford
was
a
great
patron
of
the
chase
and
his
keeper
watson
always
had
a
ready
to
turn
down
when
my
lord
hounds
met
there
jawleyford
covers
were
never
known
to
be
drawn
blank
though
they
had
been
shot
in
the
day
before
they
always
held
a
fox
the
next
if
a
fox
was
wanted
sponge
being
quite
at
home
on
the
subjects
of
horses
and
hunting
lauded
all
his
observations
up
to
the
skies
occasionally
considering
whether
it
would
be
advisable
to
sell
him
a
horse
and
thinking
if
he
did
whether
he
should
let
him
have
one
of
the
three
he
had
down
or
should
get
old
buckram
to
buy
some
quiet
screw
that
would
stand
a
little
work
and
yield
him
sponge
a
little
profit
and
yet
not
demolish
the
great
patron
of
english
sports
the
more
jawleyford
drank
the
more
energetic
he
became
and
the
greater
pleasure
he
anticipated
from
the
meet
of
the
morrow
he
docked
the
lord
and
spoke
of
as
an
excellent
fellow
a
real
good
hearty
honest
englishman
a
man
that
more
you
knew
the
more
you
liked
all
of
which
was
very
encouraging
to
sponge
spigot
at
length
appeared
to
read
the
tea
and
coffee
when
jawleyford
determined
not
to
be
done
out
of
another
bottle
pointing
to
the
nearly
emptied
decanter
said
to
robert
foozle
suppose
you
not
take
any
more
wine
to
which
robert
replied
i
not
take
any
more
wine
whereupon
pushing
out
his
chair
and
throwing
away
his
napkin
jawleyford
arose
and
led
the
way
to
the
followed
by
sponge
and
this
entertaining
young
gentleman
a
round
game
followed
tea
which
in
its
turn
was
succeeded
by
a
massive
silver
tray
chiefly
decorated
with
cold
water
and
tumblers
and
as
the
various
independent
clocks
in
the
began
chiming
and
striking
eleven
jawleyford
thought
he
would
try
to
get
rid
of
foozle
by
asking
him
if
he
had
better
stay
all
night
i
think
i
better
stay
all
night
replied
foozle
wo
they
be
expecting
you
at
home
robert
asked
jawleyford
not
feeling
disposed
to
be
caught
in
his
own
trap
they
be
expecting
me
at
home
replied
foozle
perhaps
you
had
better
not
alarm
them
by
staying
suggested
jawleyford
perhaps
i
better
not
alarm
them
by
staying
repeated
foozle
whereupon
they
all
rose
and
wishing
him
a
very
good
night
jawleyford
handed
him
over
to
spigot
who
transferred
him
to
one
footman
who
passed
him
to
another
to
button
into
his
shandridan
after
talking
robert
over
and
expatiating
on
the
misfortune
it
would
be
to
have
such
a
boy
jawleyford
rang
the
bell
for
the
banquet
of
water
to
be
taken
away
and
ordering
breakfast
earlier
than
usual
our
friends
went
to
bed
chapter
xxii
the
again
gentlemen
unaccustomed
to
public
hunting
often
make
queer
figures
of
themselves
when
they
go
out
we
have
seen
them
in
all
sorts
of
odd
dresses
half
half
fishermen
half
half
sailors
with
now
and
then
a
good
sturdy
cross
of
the
farmer
jawleyford
was
a
cross
between
a
military
dandy
and
a
squire
the
bumperkin
with
the
letters
in
front
was
cocked
jauntily
on
one
side
of
his
head
while
he
played
sportively
with
the
patent
leather
strap
now
toying
with
it
on
his
lip
now
dropping
it
below
his
chin
now
hitching
it
up
on
to
the
peak
he
had
a
tremendously
stiff
stock
on
so
hard
that
no
pressure
made
it
wrinkle
and
so
high
that
his
pointed
gills
could
hardly
peer
above
it
his
coat
was
a
bright
green
made
when
collars
were
worn
very
high
and
very
hollow
and
when
waists
were
supposed
to
be
about
the
middle
of
a
back
jawleyford
back
buttons
occupying
that
remarkable
position
these
which
were
of
dead
gold
with
a
bright
rim
represented
a
hare
full
stretch
for
her
life
and
were
the
buttons
of
the
old
muggeridge
hunt
a
hunt
that
had
died
many
years
ago
from
want
of
the
necessary
funds
to
carry
it
on
the
coat
which
was
and
was
extremely
presenting
a
remarkable
contrast
to
the
roomy
roundabouts
of
the
members
of
the
flat
hat
hunt
the
collar
rising
behind
in
the
shape
of
a
gothic
arch
exhibited
all
the
stitchings
and
threadings
incident
to
that
department
of
the
garment
but
if
jawleyford
coat
went
to
his
waistcoat
was
fox
and
all
on
a
bright
blue
ground
he
sported
such
an
infinity
of
that
there
is
no
saying
that
he
would
have
been
safe
in
a
kennel
of
unsteady
hounds
one
thing
to
be
sure
was
in
his
favour
namely
that
they
were
just
as
much
like
cats
heads
as
foxes
the
coat
and
waistcoat
were
old
stagers
but
his
nether
man
was
encased
in
tweed
pantaloons
of
the
newest
make
a
species
of
material
extremely
soft
and
comfortable
to
wear
but
not
so
well
adapted
for
roughing
it
across
country
these
had
a
broad
brown
stripe
down
the
sides
and
were
shaped
out
over
the
foot
of
his
fine
paper
boots
the
heels
of
which
were
decorated
with
ringing
spurs
thus
attired
with
a
little
whip
which
he
kept
flourishing
about
he
encountered
sponge
in
the
after
breakfast
sponge
like
all
men
who
are
natty
themselves
men
who
would
have
a
button
out
of
place
if
it
was
ever
so
hardly
knew
what
to
think
of
jawleyford
costume
it
was
clear
he
was
no
sportsman
and
then
came
the
question
whether
he
was
of
the
privileged
few
who
may
do
what
they
like
and
who
can
carry
off
any
kind
of
absurdity
whatever
uneasiness
sponge
felt
on
that
score
jawleyford
however
was
quite
at
his
ease
and
swaggered
about
like
an
at
a
review
we
should
be
going
i
suppose
said
he
drawing
on
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
and
sabreing
the
air
with
his
whip
lord
scamperdale
punctual
asked
sponge
replied
jawleyford
wait
for
i
suppose
observed
sponge
thinking
to
try
jawleyford
on
that
infallible
criterion
of
favour
if
he
knew
i
was
coming
i
dare
say
he
would
replied
jawleyford
slowly
and
deliberately
feeling
it
was
now
no
time
for
flashing
he
knew
i
was
coming
i
dare
say
he
would
repeated
he
i
make
no
doubt
he
would
but
one
does
like
putting
great
men
out
of
their
way
besides
which
it
just
as
easy
to
be
punctual
as
otherwise
when
i
was
in
the
bumperkin
your
horse
is
on
is
it
interrupted
sponge
see
your
horse
there
you
know
on
my
dear
fellow
exclaimed
jawleyford
on
no
certainly
not
how
should
i
get
there
myself
if
my
horse
was
on
to
be
sure
replied
sponge
striking
a
light
for
his
cigar
but
then
i
should
have
no
groom
to
go
with
me
observed
jawleyford
adding
must
make
a
certain
appearance
you
know
but
come
my
dear
sponge
continued
he
laying
hold
of
our
hero
arm
us
get
to
the
door
for
that
cigar
of
yours
will
fumigate
the
whole
house
and
jawleyford
hates
the
smell
of
tobacco
spigot
with
his
attendants
in
livery
here
put
a
stop
to
the
confab
by
hurrying
past
drawing
the
bolts
and
throwing
back
the
spacious
folding
doors
as
if
royalty
or
daniel
lambert
himself
were
out
the
noise
they
made
was
heard
outside
and
on
reaching
the
top
of
the
spacious
flight
of
steps
sponge
piebald
in
charge
of
a
dirty
village
lad
and
jawleyford
steeds
with
a
groom
were
seen
scuttling
under
the
portoco
for
the
owners
to
mount
the
jawleyford
cavalry
was
none
of
the
best
but
jawleyford
was
pleased
with
it
and
that
is
a
great
thing
indeed
a
thing
had
only
to
be
jawleyford
to
make
jawleyford
excessively
fond
of
it
exclaimed
he
as
they
reached
the
third
step
from
the
bottom
repeated
he
seizing
sponge
by
the
arm
what
i
call
shape
you
do
see
such
an
animal
as
that
every
day
pointing
to
a
not
badly
formed
but
evidently
bay
that
stood
knuckling
and
trembling
for
jawleyford
to
mount
of
the
has
beens
i
should
say
replied
sponge
puffing
a
cloud
of
smoke
right
past
jawleyford
nose
adding
a
pity
but
you
could
get
him
four
new
legs
i
do
see
that
he
wants
anything
of
the
sort
retorted
jawleyford
nettled
as
well
at
the
smoke
as
the
observation
where
ignorance
is
bliss
replied
sponge
with
another
great
puff
which
nearly
blinded
jawleyford
on
and
let
see
how
he
goes
added
he
passing
on
to
the
piebald
as
he
spoke
jawleyford
then
mounted
and
having
settled
himself
into
a
military
seat
touched
the
old
screw
with
the
spur
and
set
off
at
a
canter
the
piebald
perhaps
mistaking
the
portico
for
a
booth
and
thinking
it
was
a
good
place
to
exhibit
it
proceeded
to
die
in
the
most
approved
form
and
not
all
sponge
or
kicks
could
induce
him
to
rise
before
he
had
gone
through
the
whole
ceremony
at
length
with
a
mane
full
of
gravel
a
side
well
smeared
and
a
kidd
sadly
scratched
the
actor
arose
much
to
the
relief
of
the
village
lad
who
having
indulged
in
a
gallop
as
he
brought
him
from
lucksford
expected
his
death
would
be
laid
at
his
door
no
sooner
was
he
up
than
without
waiting
for
him
to
shake
himself
soapey
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
seizing
him
by
the
head
let
in
the
latchfords
in
a
style
that
satisfied
the
hack
he
was
not
going
to
canter
in
a
circle
away
he
went
best
pace
for
like
all
sponge
horses
he
had
the
knack
of
going
the
general
difficulty
being
to
get
them
to
go
the
way
they
were
wanted
sponge
presently
overtook
jawleyford
who
had
been
brought
up
by
a
gate
which
he
was
making
sundry
ineffectual
passes
and
efforts
to
open
the
gate
and
his
horse
seeming
to
have
combined
to
prevent
his
getting
through
though
an
expert
swordsman
he
had
never
been
able
to
accomplish
the
art
of
opening
a
gate
especially
one
of
those
gingerly
balanced
things
that
require
to
be
taken
at
the
nick
of
time
or
else
they
drop
just
as
the
horse
gets
his
nose
to
them
are
you
here
to
open
the
gate
asked
jawleyford
snappishly
as
the
blue
boy
bustled
up
as
his
master
efforts
became
more
hopeless
at
each
attempt
the
lad
like
a
wise
fellow
dropped
from
his
horse
and
opening
it
with
his
hands
ran
it
back
on
foot
jawleyford
and
sponge
then
rode
through
canter
canter
canter
went
jawleyford
with
an
arm
akimbo
head
well
up
legs
well
down
toes
well
pointed
as
if
he
were
going
to
a
race
where
his
work
would
end
on
arriving
instead
of
to
a
where
it
would
only
begin
illustration
jawleyford
going
to
the
hunt
are
rather
hard
on
the
old
nag
are
you
at
length
asked
sponge
as
having
cleared
the
rushy
swampy
park
they
came
upon
the
macadamized
turnpike
and
jawleyford
selected
the
middle
of
it
as
the
scene
of
his
further
progression
no
replied
jawleyford
along
with
a
loose
rein
as
if
he
was
on
the
soundest
horse
in
the
world
no
my
horses
are
used
to
it
but
if
you
mean
to
hunt
him
observed
sponge
be
blown
before
he
gets
to
cover
him
in
wind
my
dear
fellow
replied
jawleyford
him
in
wind
touching
the
horse
with
the
spur
as
he
spoke
but
if
he
was
as
well
on
his
legs
as
he
is
in
his
wind
he
not
be
amiss
rejoined
sponge
so
they
cantered
and
trotted
and
trotted
and
cantered
away
sponge
thinking
he
could
afford
pace
as
well
as
jawleyford
indeed
a
horse
has
only
to
become
a
hack
to
be
able
to
do
double
the
work
he
was
ever
supposed
to
be
capable
of
but
to
the
meet
scrambleford
green
was
a
small
straggling
village
on
the
top
of
a
somewhat
high
hill
that
divided
the
vale
in
which
jawleyford
court
was
situated
from
the
more
fertile
one
of
farthinghoe
in
which
lord
scamperdale
lived
it
was
one
of
those
places
at
which
the
meet
of
the
hounds
and
a
love
feast
or
fair
consisting
of
two
fiddlers
one
for
each
a
few
unlicensed
packmen
three
or
four
gingerbread
stalls
a
drove
of
cows
and
some
sheep
form
the
great
events
of
the
year
among
a
people
who
are
thoroughly
happy
and
contented
with
that
amount
of
gaiety
think
of
that
you
up
young
gentlemen
of
twenty
who
have
exhausted
the
pleasures
of
the
world
the
hounds
did
not
come
to
scrambleford
green
often
for
it
was
not
a
favourite
meet
and
when
they
did
come
frosty
and
the
men
generally
had
them
pretty
much
to
themselves
this
day
however
was
the
exception
and
old
tom
yarnley
whom
age
had
bent
nearly
double
and
who
hobbled
along
on
two
sticks
declared
that
never
in
the
course
of
his
recollection
a
period
extending
over
the
best
part
of
a
century
had
he
seen
such
a
of
red
coats
as
mustered
that
morning
at
scrambleford
green
it
seemed
as
if
there
had
been
a
sudden
rising
of
sportsmen
what
brought
them
all
out
what
brought
puffington
the
master
of

been
out

observed
fossick
looking
washy
over

the
field
sat
in
a
ring
about
the
hounds
in
the
centre
of
which
as
usual
were
jack
and
lord
scamperdale
looking
with
their
great
spectacles
and
short
grey
whiskers
trimmed
in
a
curve
up
to
their
noses
like
a
couple
of
horned
owls
in
hats
the
man
on
the
cow
exclaimed
jack
as
he
espied
sponge
and
jawleyford
rising
the
hill
together
easing
their
horses
by
standing
in
their
stirrups
and
holding
on
by
their
manes
do
say
so
exclaimed
lord
scamperdale
turning
his
horse
in
the
direction
jack
was
looking
and
staring
for
hard
life
too
there
is
i
declare
observed
he
and
who
the
deuce

this
with
him

jack
as
the
servant
now
hove
in
sight
it
is
said
lord
scamperdale
confounded
humbug
boy
be
after
one
of
the
young
ladies
observed
jack
one
of
the
writing
chaps
we
thought
he
was
wonder
replied
lord
scamperdale
adding
in
an
undertone
vote
we
have
a
rise
out
of
old
jaw
i
let
you
in
for
a
good
thing

shall
dine
with
him
i
replied
jack
though
replied
his
lordship
firmly
do
entreated
jack
the
powers
if
you
do
rejoined
his
lordship
shall
not
have
a
mount
out
of
me
for
a
month
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
jawleyford
and
sponge
having
risen
the
hill
had
resumed
their
seats
in
the
saddle
and
jawleyford
setting
himself
in
attitude
tickled
his
horse
with
his
spur
and
proceeded
to
canter
becomingly
up
to
the
pack
sponge
and
the
groom
following
a
little
behind
jawleyford
my
dear
fellow
exclaimed
lord
scamperdale
putting
his
horse
on
a
few
steps
to
meet
him
as
he
came
flourishing
up
jawleyford
my
dear
fellow
i
delighted
to
see
you
extending
a
hand
as
he
spoke
here
told
me
that
he
saw
your
flag
flying
as
he
passed
and
i
said
what
a
pity
it
was
but
i
known
before
for
jawleyford
said
i
is
a
real
good
fellow
one
of
the
best
fellows
i
know
and
has
asked
me
to
dine
so
often
that
i
almost
ashamed
to
meet
him
and
it
would
have
been
such
a
nice
opportunity
to
have
volunteered
a
visit
the
hounds
being
here
you
see
that
so
kind
of
your
lordship
exclaimed
jawleyford
quite
delighted
so
kind
of
your
lordship
that
just
what
i
like
that
just
what
jawleyford
likes
that
just
what
we
all
like
coming
without
fuss
or
ceremony
just
as
my
friend
sponge
here
does
by
the
way
will
your
lordship
give
me
leave
to
introduce
my
friend
sponge
my
lord
scamperdale
jawleyford
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
manoeuvring
the
ceremony
i
made
sponge
acquaintance
yesterday
observed
his
lordship
drily
giving
a
sort
of
servants
touch
of
his
hat
as
he
scrutinized
our
friend
through
his
formidable
glasses
adding
tell
you
the
truth
addressing
himself
in
an
underone
to
sponge
took
you
for
one
of
those
nasty
writing
chaps
who
i
but
continued
his
lordship
returning
to
jawleyford
tell
you
what
i
said
about
the
dinner
jack
here
told
me
the
flag
was
flying
and
i
said
i
only
wished
i
known
before
and
i
would
certainly
have
proposed
that
jack
and
i
should
dine
with
you
either
or
but
unfortunately
i
engaged
myself
to
my
lord
barker
not
five
minutes
before
my
lord
exclaimed
jawleyford
throwing
out
his
hand
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
if
in
despair
tantalize
me
you
do
indeed
you
should
have
come
or
said
nothing
about
it
you
distress
me
you
do
indeed
i
wrong
perhaps
replied
his
lordship
patting
jawleyford
encouragingly
on
the
shoulder
however
i
tell
you
what
said
he
here
not
engaged
and
he
shall
come
to
you
happy
to
see
ha
hum
haw
jack
that
to
say
spraggon
replied
jawleyford
bowing
very
low
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
as
if
quite
overpowered
at
the
idea
of
the
honour
that
a
bargain
jack
said
his
lordship
looking
knowingly
round
at
his
much
disconcerted
friend
dine
and
stay
all
night
at
jawleyford
court
and
mind
added
he
yourself
to
the
girls
ladies
that
to
say
your
lordship
arrange
it
so
that
we
might
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
both
on
some
future
day
asked
jawleyford
anxious
to
avert
the
jack
calamity
next
week
continued
he
suppose
you
meet
at
the
court
he
hum
meet
at
the
court
mumbled
his
lordship
at
the
court
ha
he
ha
hum
no
got
no
foxes
of
foxes
i
assure
you
my
lord
exclaimed
jawleyford
of
foxes
repeated
he
never
find
them
then
somehow
observed
his
lordship
drily
least
none
but
those
beggars
in
the
laurels
at
the
back
of
the
stables
that
will
be
the
fault
of
the
hounds
replied
jawleyford
take
sufficient
time
to
draw
run
through
the
covers
too
quickly
of
the
hounds
be
hanged
exclaimed
jack
who
was
the
champion
of
the
pack
generally
not
a
more
patient
painstaking
pack
in
the
world
than
his
lordship
well
ah
never
mind
that
replied
his
lordship
and
you
can
settle
that
point
over
your
wine
meanwhile
if
your
friend
here
get
his
horse
continued
his
lordship
addressing
himself
to
jawleyford
but
looking
at
sponge
who
was
still
on
the
piebald
throw
off
you
my
lord
replied
sponge
i
mount
at
the
cover
side
sponge
not
being
inclined
to
let
the
flat
hat
hunt
field
see
the
difference
of
opinion
that
occasionally
existed
between
the
gallant
brown
and
himself
you
please
rejoined
his
lordship
you
please
jerking
his
head
at
frostyface
who
forthwith
gave
the
office
to
the
hounds
whereupon
all
was
commotion
away
the
cavalcade
went
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
late
bustling
village
resumed
its
wonted
quiet
the
old
man
on
sticks
two
crones
gossiping
at
a
door
a
going
about
with
a
donkey
and
a
parcel
of
dirty
children
tumbling
about
on
the
green
being
all
that
remained
on
the
scene
all
the
men
had
followed
the
hounds
why
the
hounds
had
ever
climbed
the
long
hill
seemed
a
mystery
seeing
that
they
returned
the
way
they
came
jawleyford
though
sore
disconcerted
at
having
pawned
upon
him
stuck
to
my
lord
and
rode
on
his
right
with
the
air
of
a
general
he
felt
he
was
doing
his
duty
as
an
englishman
in
thus
patronizing
the
hounds
encouraging
a
manly
spirit
of
independence
and
promoting
our
unrivalled
breed
of
horses
the
trot
at
which
hounds
travel
to
be
sure
is
not
well
adapted
for
dignity
but
jawleyford
nourished
and
vapoured
as
well
as
he
could
under
the
circumstances
and
considering
they
were
going
down
hill
lord
scamperdale
rode
along
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
the
idea
of
the
pleasant
evening
jack
and
jawleyford
would
have
together
occasionally
complimenting
jawleyford
on
the
cut
and
condition
of
his
horse
and
advising
him
to
be
careful
of
the
switching
raspers
with
which
the
country
abounded
and
which
might
be
fatal
to
his
nice
nutmeg
coloured
trousers
the
rest
of
the
followed
the
fall
of
the
ground
enabling
them
to
see
thick
jawleyford
was
with
my
lord
old
blossomnose
who
we
should
observe
had
slipped
away
unperceived
on
jawleyford
arrival
took
a
view
from
the
rear
naughty
blossom
was
riding
the
horse
that
ought
to
have
gone
in
the

jawleyford
court
chapter
xxiii
the
great
run
our
hero
having
inveigled
the
brown
under
lee
of
an
as
the
field
moved
along
was
fortunate
enough
to
achieve
the
saddle
without
disclosing
the
secrets
of
the
stable
and
as
he
rejoined
the
throng
in
all
the
pride
of
shape
action
and
condition
even
the
fossick
fyle
bliss
and
others
admitted
that
hercules
was
not
a
horse
while
the
ones
eyed
sponge
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
envy
thinking
what
a
fine
trade
literature
must
be
to
stand
such
a
horse
your
friend
a
workman
asked
lord
scamperdale
nodding
towards
sponge
as
he
trotted
hercules
gently
past
on
the
turf
by
the
side
of
the
road
along
which
they
were
riding
no
replied
jawleyford
tartly
no
gentleman
man
of
property
did
not

he
a

explained
his
lordship
drily
a

jawleyford

all

observed
his
lordship
adding
to
himself
jack

take
the
conceit
out
of
him
halloaed
he
over
his
shoulder
to
his
friend
who
was
jogging
a
little
behind
repeated
he
something
observed
jawleyford
with
an
emphasis
sponge
continued
his
lordship
a
stranger
in
the
country

the
kindness
to
take
of
him
you
know
what
i
mean
so
replied
jack
take

of
him
polite
of
your
lordship
i
sure
said
jawleyford
with
a
low
bow
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
breast
can
assure
you
i
shall
never
forget
the
marked
attention
i
have
received
from
your

this

himself

ere

had
reached
the
last
angle
of
the
long
hill
frostyface
was
rolling
about
on

in
the
luxuriant
evergreen
now
wholly
visible
now
all
but
overhead
like
a
man
buffeting
among
the
waves
of
the
sea
save
frosty
cheery
voice
encouraging
the
invisible
pack
to
him
and
him
out
an
injunction
that
the
shaking
of
the
gorse
showed
they
willingly
obeyed
and
an
occasional
exclamation
from
jawleyford
of
beautiful
never
saw
better
hounds
ca
be
a
finer
pack
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
scene
the
waggoners
on
the
road
stopped
their
wains
the
late
noisy
ploughmen
leaned
vacantly
on
their
stilts
the
stood
erect

the
shepherds

deserted

varying
the
entertainment
with
a
loud
crack
of
his
heavy
whip
when
he
could
get
upon
a
piece
of
rising
ground
to
clear
the
thong
screamed
jawleyford
hoisting
the
bumperkin
yeomanry

in
the

repeated
he
looking
triumphantly
round
as
much
as

was
posted
a

he
amidst

uproarious
mirth
of
the
company

your
great
staring
specs
on
or
i
should
have
seen
he
had
a
tail
retorted
jawleyford
nettled
at
the
tone
in
which
jack
had
addressed
him
be
replied
jack
with
a
sneer
but
a
tailor
would
call
it
a
tail
just
then
a
light
low
squeak
of
a
whimper
was
heard
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
gorse
and
frostyface
cheered
the
hound
to
the
echo
to

screamed
he
in
a
note
that
thrilled
through
every
frame
and
set
the
horses
ere
frosty
prolonged
screech
was
fairly
finished
there
was
such
an
outburst
of
melody
and
such
a
shaking
of
the
as
plainly
showed
there
was
no
safety
for

the
bustle

stealing
gently
forward
on

of
a
thick
fence
for
the
double
purpose
of
shirking
jawleyford
and
getting
a
good
start
in

and
similar
preparations
for

up
went

at

a
volley
of
burst
from

whisking

was
seen
stealing
away
over

was
there
how
pale

looked
how
happy

out

for

roared
jack
clapping
spurs
into
his
grey
or
rather
into
his
lordship
grey
dashing
in
front
and
drawing
the
horse
across
the
road
to
stop
the
progression
of
the
field
hard
repeated
jack
standing
erect
in
his
stirrups
and
menacing
them
with
his
whip
a
most
formidable
one
you
do
let
them
get
away
do
spoil
your
own
sport
pray
remember
they
his

hounds
that
they
cost
him
under
two
thousand
five
under
a
year
and
where
let
me
ax
with
wheat
down
to
nothing
would
you
get
another
if
he
was
to
throw
up
as
jack
made
this
inquiry
he
took
a
hurried
glance
at
the
now
pack
and
seeing
they
were
safe
away
he
wiped
the
foam
from
his
mouth
on
his
sleeve
dropped
into
his
saddle
and
catching
his
horse
short
round
by
the
head
clapped
spurs
into
his
sides
and
galloped
away
exclaiming
ye
tinkers
we
all
start
fair
then
there
was
such
a
scrimmage
such
jostling
and
elbowing
among
the
jealous
ones
such
ramming
and
cramming
among
the
eager
ones
such
among
the
polite
ones
such
spurting
of
ponies
such
clambering
of
all
were
bent
on
going
as
far
as
they
could
all
except
jawleyford
who
sat
curvetting
and
prancing
in
the
patronizing
sort
of
way
gentlemen
do
who
encourage
hounds
for
the
sake
of
the
manly
spirit
the
sport
engenders
and
the
advantage
hunting
is
of
in
promoting
our
unrivalled
breed
of
horses
his
lordship
having
slipped
away

in

under
pretence
of
blowing
the
hounds
out
of

as
soon
as
he
set

at

pocketing
his

then
flew
the

together
screamed
jack
in
the
air
as
he
saw
the
hounds
packing
well
together
and
racing
with
a
scent
screamed
his
lordship
who
was
a
sort
of
echo
to
his
huntsman
just
as
jack
spraggon
was
echo
to
his
lordship
away
for
gunnersby
craigs
observed
jack
pointing
that
way
for
they
were
a
good
ten
miles
off
so
replied
his
lordship
for
whom
the
distance
could
never
be
too
great
provided
the
pace
corresponded
screamed
jack
screeched
his
lordship
so
they
went
flying
and
together
none
of
the
field
thanks
to
jack
spraggon
being
able
to
overtake
them
he
goes
at
last
cried
frosty
taking
off
his
cap
as
he
viewed
the
fox
some
ahead
stealing
away
round
the
side
of
newington
hill
screeched
his
lordship
riding
with
his
flat
hat
in
the
air
by
way
of
exciting
the
striving
field
to
still
further
exertion
a
good
exclaimed
frosty
eyeing
the
fox
going
is
that
replied
his
lordship
staring
at
him
with
all
his
might
then
they
rode
on
and
were
presently
rounding
newington
hill
themselves
the
hounds
packing
well
together
and
carrying
a
famous
head
his
lordship
now
looked
to
see
what
was
going
on
behind
scrambleford
hill
was
far
in
the
rear
jawleyford
and
the
boy
in
blue
were
altogether
lost
in
the
distance
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
this
way
were
a
couple
of
dots
of
horsemen
one
on
a
white
the
other
on
a
dark
colour
most
likely
jones
the
keeper
and
farmer
stubble
on
the
foaly
mare
then
a
little
nearer
was
a
man
in
a
hedge
trying
to
coax
his
horse
after
him
stopping
the
way
of
two
boys
in
white
trousers
whose
ponies
looked
like
rats
again
a
little
nearer
were
some
of
the
persevering
ones
men
who
still
hold
on
in
the
forlorn
hopes
of
a
check
all
and
mostly
trousered
then
came
the
last
of
the
tom
washball
charley
joyce
and
sam
sloman
riding
well
in
the
first
flight
of
second
horsemen
his
lordship
fossick
man
in
drab
with
a
green
collar
wake
in
blue
also
a
lad
in
scarlet
and
a
flat
hat
with
a
second
horse
for
the
huntsman
drawing
still
nearer
came
the
ruck
men
in
red
men
in
brown
men
in
livery
a
farmer
or
two
in
fustian
all
mingled
together
and
a
few
hundred
yards
before
these
and
close
upon
his
lordship
were
the
of
the
field
five
men
in
scarlet
and
one
in
black
let
us
see
who
they
are
by
the
powers
sponge
is
first
sponge
sailing
away
at
his
ease
followed
by
jack
who
is
staring
at
him
through
his
great
lamps
longing
to
launch
out
at
him
but
as
yet
wanting
an
excuse
sponge
having
ridden
with
judgement
judgement
at
least
in
everything
except
in
having
taken
the
lead
of
jack
after
jack
comes
old
blossomnose
and
wake
fossick
and
fyle
complete
our
complement
of
five
they
are
all
riding
steadily
and
well
all
very
irate
however
at
the
stranger
for
going
before
them
and
ready
to
back
jack
in
anything
he
may
say
or
do
on
on
they
go
the
hounds
still
pressing
forward
though
not
carrying
quite
so
good
a
head
as
before
in
truth
they
have
run
four
miles
in
twenty
minutes
pretty
good
going
anywhere
except
upon
paper
where
they
always
go
unnaturally
fast
however
there
they
are
still
pressing
on
though
with
considerably
less
music
than
before
after
rounding
newington
hill
they
got
into
a
wilder
and
worse
sort
of
country
among
moorish
land
with
cold
fallows
the
day
too
seemed
changing
for
the
worse
a
heavy
black
cloud
hanging
overhead
the
hounds
were
at
length
brought
to
their
noses
his
lordship
who
had
been
riding
all
eyes
ears
and
fears
foresaw
the
probability
of
this
and
his
horse
held
up
his
hand
the
usual
signal
for
jack
to
out
and
stop
the
field
sponge
saw
the
signal
but
unfortunately
hercules
did
and
tearing
along
with
his
head
to
the
ground
resolutely
bore
our
friend
not
only
past
his
lordship
but
right
on
to
where
the
now
stooping
pack
were
barely
feathering
on
the
line
then
jack
and
his
lordship
sang
out
together
hard
screeched
his
lordship
in
a
dreadful
state
of
excitement
hard
thundered
jack
sponge
holding
hard
hard
enough
to
split
the
horse
jaws
but
the
beast
would
go
on
notwithstanding
the
powers
he
among
again
shouted
his
lordship
as
the
resolute
beast
with
his
upturned
head
almost
pulled
round
to
knee
went
on
like
the
blind
man
in
regent
street
out
jack
sing
out
for
heaven
sake
sing
out
shrieked
his
lordship
shutting
his
eyes
as
he
added
he
kill
every
man
jack
of
them
sur
roared
jack
you
steer
that
quadruped
of
yours
you
pestilential
son
of
a
screeched
his
lordship
as
brilliant
ran
yelping
away
from
under
sponge
horse
feet
out
jack
sing
out
gasped
his
lordship
again
you
scandalous
hypocritical
son
of
a
puffing
why
do
you
turn
your
attention
to
feeding
hens
cultivating
cabbages
or
making
pantaloons
for
small
folk
instead
of
killing
hounds
in
this
wholesale
way
roared
jack
an
inquiry
that
set
him
foaming
again
you
unsightly
sanctified
idolatrous
coppersmith
you
think
because
i
a
lord
and
ca
swear
or
use
coarse
language
that
you
may
do
what
you
like
rot
you
sir
i
present
you
with
a
testimonial
i
settle
a
hundred
a
year
upon
you
if
you
quit
the
country
by
the
powers
they
away
again
added
his
lordship
who
with
one
eye
on
sponge
and
the
other
on
the
pack
had
been
watching
frosty
lifting
them
over
the
bad
till
holding
them
on
to
a
hedgerow
beyond
they
struck
the
scent
on
good
sound
pasture
and
went
away
at
score
every
hound
throwing
his
tongue
and
filling
the
air
with
joyful
melody
away
they
swept
like
a
hurricane
was
again
the
cry
it
jack
exclaimed
lord
scamperdale
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
as
they
galloped
alongside
of
each
other
it
jack
see
if
you
ca
sarve
out
this
unrighteous
if
you
die
for
it
i
bury
your
remainders
genteelly
patent
coffin
with
brass
nails
all
to
yourself
put
frosty
and
all
the
fellows
in
black
and
raise
a
white
marble
monument
to
your
memory
declaring
you
were
the
most
spotless
virtuous
man
under
the
sun
me
off
dining
with
jaw
and
i
do
my
best
replied
jack
screamed
his
lordship
flourishing
his
right
arm
in
the
air
as
he
flew
over
a
great
stone
wall
a
good
many
of
the
horses
and
sportsmen
too
had
had
enough
before
the
hounds
checked
and
the
quick
way
frosty
lifted
them
and
hit
off
the
scent
did
not
give
them
much
time
to
recruit
many
of
them
now
sat
hat
in
hand
mopping
and
puffing
and
turning
their
red
perspiring
faces
to
the
wind
gasped
one
as
if
he
was
going
to
be
sick
went
another
but
it
exclaimed
a
third
pulling
off
his
limp
neckcloth
if
there
any
ale
hereabouts
cried
a
fourth
run
observed
a
fifth
miles
at
least
gasped
another
meanwhile
the
hounds
went
streaming
on
and
it
is
wonderful
how
soon
those
who
follow
are
left
hopelessly
in
the
rear
of
the
few
that
did
follow
sponge
however
was
one
nothing
daunted
by
the
compliments
that
had
been
paid
him
he
got
hercules
well
in
hand
and
the
horse
dropping
again
on
the
bit
resumed
his
place
in
front
going
as
strong
and
steadily
as
ever
thus
he
went
throwing
the
mud
in
the
faces
of
those
behind
regardless
of
the
oaths
and
imprecations
that
followed
sponge
knowing
full
well
they
would
do
the
same
by
him
if
they
could
jealousy
said
sponge
spurring
his
horse
saw
such
a
jealous
set
of
dogs
in
my
life
an
accommodating
lane
soon
presented
itself
along
which
they
all
pounded
with
the
hounds
running
parallel
through
the
enclosures
on
the
left
sponge
sending
such
volleys
of
pebbles
and
mud
in
his
rear
as
made
it
advisable
to
keep
a
good
way
behind
him
the
line
was
now
apparently
for
firlingham
woods
but
on
nearing
the
thatched
cottage
on
gasper
heath
the
fox
most
likely
being
headed
had
turned
short
to
the
right
and
the
chase
now
lay
over
sheeplow
water
meadows
and
so
on
to
bolsover
when
the
pack
again
changed
from
hunting
to
racing
and
the
pace
for
a
time
was
severe
his
lordship
having
got
his
second
horse
at
the
turn
was
ready
for
the
tussle
and
plied
away
vigorously
riding
as
usual
with
all
his
heart
with
all
his
mind
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
strength
while
jack
still
on
the
grey
came
plodding
diligently
along
in
the
rear
saving
his
horse
as
much
as
he
could
his
lordship
charged
a
stiff
flight
of
rails
in
the
while
jack
thinking
to
save
his
rode
at
a
weak
place
in
the
fence
a
little
higher
up
and
in
an
instant
was
soused
overhead
in
a
under
jack
duck
under
screamed
his
lordship
as
jack
head
rose
to
the
surface
under
you
have
it
full
directly
added
he
eyeing
sponge
and
the
rest
coming
up
sponge
however
saw
the
splash
and
turning
a
little
lower
down
landed
safe
on
sound
ground
while
poor
blossomnose
who
was
next
went
floundering
overhead
also
but
the
pace
was
too
good
to
stop
to
fish
them
out
it
said
sponge
looking
at
them
splashing
about
that
was
a
near
go
for
me
jack
being
thus
disposed
of
sponge
with
increased
confidence
rose
in
his
stirrups
easing
the
redoubtable
hercules
and
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
at
the
same
time
that
he
gave
him
the
gentlest
possible
touch
of
the
spur
exclaimed
the
powers
we
show
these
old
flat
hats
the
trick
he
then
commenced
humming
mister
sponge
the
raspers
taking
sets
the
junkers
nerves
a
shaking
and
riding
cheerfully
on
he
at
length
found
himself
on
the
confines
of
a
wild
moor
with
an
undulating
range
of
hills
in
the
distance
frostyface
and
lord
scamperdale
here
for
the
first
time
diverged
from
the
line
the
hounds
were
running
and
made
for
the
neck
of
a
smooth
flat
rather
piece
of
ground
instead
of
crossing
it
sponge
thinking
to
get
a
niche
rode
to
it
and
the
and
deeper
still
sort
of
flounder
his
horse
made
soon
let
him
know
that
he
was
in
a
bog
the
impetuous
hercules
rushed
and
reared
onwards
as
if
to
clear
the
wide
expanse
and
alighting
still
lower
shot
sponge
right
overhead
in
the
middle
illustration
cooked
goose
exclaimed
his
lordship
eyeing
sponge
and
his
horse
floundering
about
in
the
black
mess
my
horse
hallooed
sponge
to
the
first
whip
who
came
galloping
up
as
hercules
was
breasting
his
way
out
again
him
yourself
grunted
the
man
galloping
on
a
more
humane
received
the
horse
as
he
emerged
from
the
black
sea
exclaiming
as
the
sponge
came
lobbing
after
on
foot
sir
but
ye
should
niver
set
tee
to
ride
through
sic
a
place
as
that
sponge
having
generously
rewarded
the
man
with
a
fourpenny
piece
for
catching
his
horse
and
scraping
the
thick
of
the
mud
off
him
again
mounted
and
cantered
round
the
point
he
should
at
first
have
gone
but
his
chance
was
out
the
farther
he
went
the
farther
he
was
left
behind
till
at
last
pulling
up
he
stood
watching
the
diminishing
pack
rolling
like
marbles
over
the
top
of
rotherjade
hill
followed
by
his
lordship
hugging
his
horse
round
the
neck
as
he
went
and
the
huntsman
and
whips
leading
and
driving
theirs
up
before
them
jealous
old
beggar
said
sponge
eyeing
his
lessening
lordship
disappearing
over
the
hill
too
sponge
then
performed
the
sickening
ceremony
of
turning
away
from
hounds
running
not
but
that
he
might
have
plodded
on
on
the
line
and
perhaps
seen
or
heard
what
became
of
the
fox
but
sponge
did
hunt
on
those
terms
like
a
good
many
other
gentlemen
he
would
be
first
or
nowhere
if
it
was
any
consolation
to
him
he
had
plenty
of
companions
in
misfortune
the
line
was
dotted
with
horsemen
back
to
the
the
first
person
he
overtook
wending
his
way
home
in
the
discontented
moody
humour
of
a
man
was
puffington
master
of
the
hanby
hounds
at
whose
appearance
at
the
meet
we
expressed
our
surprise
neighbouring
masters
of
hounds
are
often
more
or
less
jealous
of
each
other
no
man
in
the
world
is
too
insignificant
for
censure
lord
scamperdale
an
undoubted
sportsman
while
poor
puffington
thought
of
nothing
but
how
to
be
thought
one
hearing
the
mistaken
rumour
that
a
great
writer
was
down
he
thought
that
his
chance
of
immortality
was
arrived
and
ordering
his
best
horse
and
putting
on
his
best
apparel
had
braved
the
jibes
and
sneers
of
jack
and
his
lordship
for
the
purpose
of
scraping
acquaintance
with
the
stranger
in
that
he
had
been
foiled
there
was
no
time
at
the
meet
to
get
introduced
neither
could
he
get
jostled
beside
sponge
in
going
down
to
the
cover
while
the
quick
find
the
quick
get
away
followed
by
the
quick
thing
we
have
described
were
equally
unfavourable
to
the
undertaking
nevertheless
puffington
had
held
on
beyond
the
and
had
he
but
persevered
a
little
farther
he
would
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
helping
sponge
out
of
the
bog
sponge
now
seeing
a
red
coat
a
little
before
trotted
on
and
quickly
overtook
a
fine
nippy
dandified
looking
gentleman
with
marvellously
smart
leathers
and
boots
a
great
contrast
to
the
large
roomy
bargemanlike
costume
of
the
members
of
the
flat
hat
hunt
not
hurt
i
hope
exclaimed
puffington
with
anxiety
as
he
looked
at
sponge
clothes
no

sponge
no

more

exclaimed
puffington
eyeing
the
hercules
over
head
replied
sponge
saw
me
going
and
the
grace
to
halloa
that
like
him
replied
puffington
like
him
nothing
pleases
him
so
much
as
getting
fellows
into
grief
very
polite
to
a
stranger
observed
sponge
it
is
replied
puffington
it
is
far
from
it
indeed
far
from
it
but
low
be
it
spoken
added
he
lordship
is
only
a
roughish
sort
of
customer
he
is
replied
sponge
who
thought
it
fine
to
abuse
a
nobleman
fact
is
said
puffington
flat
hat
chaps
are
all
snobs
they
think
there
are
no
such
fine
fellows
as
themselves
under
the
sun
and
if
ever
a
stranger
looks
near
them
they
make
a
point
of
being
as
rude
and
disagreeable
to
him
as
they
possibly
can
this
is
what
they
call
keeping
the
hunt
select
observed
sponge
recollecting
how
they
had
complimented
him
adding
seem
a
queer
set
a
fellow
they
call
jack
observed
puffington
acts
as
a
sort
of
bulldog
to
his
lordship
and
worries
whoever
his
lordship
sets
him
upon
he
got
into
a
a
little
farther
back
and
a
precious
splashing
he
was
making
along
with
the
chaplain

blossomnose
i
saw

puffington

a
sort
of
general
acquaintance

the
meets
of

bowing
adding
something
about

sponge

understand

down
upon
you
as

said

booking
it
in
his
mind
and
eyeing
his
victim
show
you
a
fine
pack
of
hounds
said
puffington
finer
animals
than
those
of
old
scamperdale

that
wo

without

frantic
devils
that
will
tear
over
half
a

without

and

and

puffington
was
interrupted
in
the
comparison
he
was
about
to
draw
between
his
lordship
hounds
and
his
by
arriving
at
the
bolsover
and
seeing
jack
and
blossomnose
horse
in
hand
running
to
and
fro
while
sundry
countrymen
blobbed
about
in
the
they
had
so
recently
occupied
tom
washball
wake
fyle
fossick
and
several
horsemen
and
boys
were
congregated
around
jack
had
lost
his
spectacles
and
blossomnose
his
whip
and
the
countrymen
were
diving
for
them
hurt
i
hope
said
puffington
in
the
most
dandified
tone
of
indifference
as
he
rode
up
to
where
jack
and
blossomnose
were
churning
the
water
in
their
boots
stamping
up
and
down
trying
to
get
themselves
warm

hanged
replied
jack
who
had
a
frightful
squint
that
turned
his
eyes
inside
out
when
he
was
in
a
passion

hanged
said
he
have
been
drownded
for
anything
you
have
cared
should
have
been
sorry
for
that

puffington
adding

could
ill

to

so
useful
and
ornamental
a
member
do
know
what
the

jack
who
had
got
all
the
clay
out
of
his
mouth
i
know
they
can
afford
to
do
without
the
company
of
certain
gentlemen
who
shall
be
nameless
said
he
looking
at
sponge
and
puffington
as
he
thought
but
in
reality
showing
nothing
but
the
whites
of
his
eyes
told
you
so
said
puffington
jerking
his
head
towards
jack
as

and
he
turned
their
horses
heads
to
ride
away

repeated
he
a

of
their

jogged
on

as

lord

we
fear
our

will
expect
something
gay
from
the
above

outside
fiddlers
feathers
and
flirters

fair
ladies
nothing
of
the
sort
lord
scamperdale
home
simply
means
that
his
lordship
was
not
out
hunting
that
he
had
got
his
dirty
boots
and
breeches
off
and
dry
tweeds
and
tartans
on
lord
scamperdale
was
the
eighth
earl
and
according
to
the
usual
alternating
course
of
great
english
families
one
generation
living
and
the
next
starving
it
was
his
lordship
turn
to
live
but
the
seventh
earl
having
been
rather
unreasonable
in
the
length
of
his
lease
the
present
earl
who
during
the
lifetime
of
his
father
was
lord
hardup
had
contracted
such
parsimonious
habits
that
when
he
came
into
possession
he
could
not
shake
them
off
and
but
for
the
fortunate
friendship
of
abraham
brown
the
village
blacksmith
who
had
given
his
young
idea
a
sporting
turn
entering
him
with
ferrets
and
rabbits
and
so
training
him
on
with
terriers
and
and
up
to
the
noble
sport
of
itself
in
all
probability
his
lordship
would
have
been
a
regular
miser
as
it
was
he
did
not
spend
a
halfpenny
upon
anything
but
hunting
and
his
hunting
though
well
was
still
economically
done
costing
him
some
couple
of
thousand
a
year
to
which
for
the
sake
of
euphony
jack
used
to
add
an
extra
five
hundred
thousand
five
under
a
year
under
a
year
sounding
better
as
jack
thought
and
more
imposing
than
a
couple
of
thousand
or
two
thousand
a
year
there
were
few
days
on
which
jack
did
inform
the
field
what
the
hounds
cost
his
lordship
or
rather
what
they
did
cost
him
woodmansterne
his
lordship
principal
residence
was
a
fine
place
it
stood
in
an
undulating
park
of
acres
with
its
church
and
its
lakes
and
its
heronry
and
its
decoy
and
its
racecourse
and
its
varied
grasses
of
the
choicest
kinds
for
feeding
the
numerous
herds
of
deer
so
well
known
at
temple
bar
and
charing
cross
as
the
woodmansterne
venison
the
house
was
a
modern
edifice
built
by
the
sixth
earl
who
having
been
a
had
run
himself
aground
by
his
enormous
outlay
on
this
italian
structure
which
was
just
finished
when
he
died
the
fourth
earl
who
we
should
have
stated
was
a
too
was
a
man
of
a
great
traveller
and
collector
of
coins
pictures
statues
marbles
and
curiosities
generally
things
that
are
very
dear
to
buy
but
oftentimes
extremely
cheap
when
sold
and
having
collected
a
vast
quantity
from
all
parts
of
the
world
no
easy
feat
in
those
days
he
made
them
heirlooms
and
departed
this
life
leaving
the
next
earl
the
pleasure
of
contemplating
them
the
fifth
earl
having
duly
starved
through
life
then
made
way
for
the
sixth
who
finding
such
a
quantity
of
valuables
stowed
away
as
he
thought
in
rather
a
confined
way
sent
to
london
for
a
architect
sir
thomas
squareall
who
always
posted
with
four
horses
who
forthwith
pulled
down
the
old
elizabethan
mansion
and
built
the
present
splendid
italian
structure
of
the
finest
polished
stone
at
an
expense
of
furniture
and
all
say
sir
estimates
being
the
seventh
earl
of
course
they
starved
and
the
present
lord
at
the
age
of
found
himself
in
possession
of
house
and
coins
and
curiosities
and
best
of
all
of
some
in
the
funds
which
had
quietly
rolled
up
during
the
latter
part
of
his
venerable
parent
existence
his
lordship
then
took
counsel
with
himself
first
whether
he
should
marry
or
remain
single
secondly
whether
he
should
live
or
starve
having
considered
the
subject
with
all
the
attention
a
limited
allowance
of
brains
permitted
he
came
to
the
resolution
that
the
second
proposition
depended
a
good
deal
upon
the
first
said
he
to
himself
i
marry
my
lady
perhaps
may
me
live
and
therefore
said
he
i
better
remain
single
at
all
events
he
came
to
the
determination
not
to
marry
in
a
hurry
and
until
he
did
he
felt
there
was
no
occasion
for
him
to
inconvenience
himself
by
living
so
he
had
the
house
put
away
in
brown
holland
the
carpets
rolled
up
the
pictures
covered
the
statues
shrouded
in
muslin
the
cabinets
of
curiosities
locked
the
plate
secured
the
china
closeted
and
everything
arranged
with
the
greatest
care
against
the
time
which
he
put
before
him
in
the
distance
like
a
target
when
he
should
marry
and
begin
to
live
at
first
he
gave
two
or
three
great
dinners
a
year
about
the
height
of
the
fruit
season
and
when
it
was
getting
too
ripe
for
carriage
to
london
by
the
old
coaches
when
a
grand
airing
of
the
used
to
take
place
and
ladies
from
all
parts
of
the
county
used
to
sit
shivering
with
their
bare
shoulders
all
anxious
for
the
honours
of
the
head
of
the
table
his
lordship
always
held
out
that
he
was
a
marrying
man
but
even
if
he
they
would
have
come
all
the
same
an
unmarried
man
being
always
clearly
on
the
cards
and
though
he
was
stumpy
and
clumsy
and
ugly
with
as
little
to
say
for
himself
as
could
well
be
conceived
they
all
agreed
that
he
was
a
most
engaging
attractive
man
quite
a
pattern
of
a
man
even
on
horseback
and
in
his
hunting
clothes
in
which
he
looked
far
the
best
he
was
only
a
coarse
square
looking
man
with
hard
dry
round
features
that
never
looked
young
and
yet
somehow
never
get
old
indeed
barring
the
change
from
brown
to
grey
of
his
short
stubbly
whiskers
which
he
trained
with
great
care
into
a
curve
almost
on
to
his
he
looked
very
little
older
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
writing
than
he
did
a
dozen
years
before
when
he
was
lord
hardup
these
dozen
years
however
had
brought
him
down
in
his
doings
the
dinners
had
gradually
dwindled
away
altogether
and
he
had
had
all
the
large
tablecloths
and
napkins
rough
dried
and
locked
away
against
he
got
married
an
event
that
he
seemed
more
anxious
to
provide
for
the
more
unlikely
it
became
he
had
also
abdicated
the
main
body
of
the
mansion
and
taken
up
his
quarters
in
what
used
to
be
the
steward
room
into
which
he
could
creep
quietly
by
a
side
door
opening
from
the
outer
entrance
and
so
save
frequent
exposure
to
the
cold
and
damp
of
the
large
hall
beyond
through
the
steward
room
was
what
used
to
be
the
muniment
room
which
he
converted
into
a
bedroom
for
himself
and
a
little
farther
along
the
passage
was
another
small
chamber
made
out
of
what
used
to
be
the
whereof
jack
or
whoever
was
in
office
had
the
possession
all
three
rooms
were
furnished
in
the
roughest
coarsest
homeliest
way
his
lordship
wishing
to
keep
all
the
good
furniture
against
he
got
married
the
or
parlour
as
his
lordship
called
it
had
an
old
grey
drugget
for
a
carpet
an
old
round
black
mahogany
table
on
castors
that
the
last
steward
had
ejected
as
too
bad
for
him
four
walnut
an
old
sideboard
with
very
little
middle
over
which
swung
a
few
bookshelves
with
the
termination
of
their
green
strings
surmounted
by
a
couple
of
brushes
small
as
the
shelves
were
they
were
larger
than
his
lordship
wanted
two
books
one
for
jack
and
one
for
himself
being
all
they
contained
while
the
other
shelves
were
filled
with
odd
spurs
knots
of
whipcord
piles
of
halfpence
boxes
and
miscellaneous
articles
his
lordship
fare
was
as
rough
as
his
furniture
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
tripe
and
delicacies
of
that
kind
he
had
tripe
twice
a
week
boiled
one
day
fried
another
he
was
also
a
great
patron
of
beefsteaks
which
he
ate
with
slices
of
cold
onion
served
in
a
saucer
with
water
it
was
a
day
on
which
the
foregoing
run
took
place
and
his
lordship
and
jack
having
satisfied
nature
off
their
respective
dishes
for
they
only
had
vegetables
in
common
and
having
finished
off
with
some
very
strong
cheshire
cheese
wheeled
their
chairs
to
the
fire
while
bags
the
butler
cleared
the
table
and
placed
it
between
them
they
were
dressed
in
full
suits
of
flaming
tartans
the
tartan
of
that
noble
clan
the
with
shetland
hose
and
red
slippers
his
lordship
and
jack
had
related
their
mutual
adventures
by
cross
visits
to
each
other
bedrooms
while
dressing
and
dinner
being
announced
by
the
time
they
were
ready
they
had
fallen
to
and
applied
themselves
diligently
to
the
victuals
and
now
very
considerately
unbuttoned
their
waistcoats
and
stuck
out
their
legs
to
give
it
a
fair
chance
of
digesting
they
seldom
spoke
much
until
his
lordship
had
had
his
nap
which
he
generally
took
immediately
after
dinner
but
on
this
particular
night
he
sat
bending
forward
in
his
chair
picking
his
teeth
and
looking
at
his
toes
evidently
ill
at
ease
in
his
mind
jack
guessed
the
cause
but
did
say
anything
sponge
he
thought
had
beat
him
at
length
his
lordship
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
stretching
his
little
queer
legs
out
before
him
began
to
breathe
thicker
and
thicker
till
at
last
he
got
the
melody
up
to
a
grunt
it
was
not
the
fine
generous
snore
of
a
sleep
that
he
usually
enjoyed
but
short
fitful
broken
naps
that
generally
terminated
in
spasmodic
jerks
of
the
arms
or
legs
these
grew
worse
till
at
last
all
four
went
at
once
like
the
limbs
of
a
peter
waggey
when
throwing
himself
forward
with
a
violent
effort
he
awoke
and
finding
his
horse
was
not
of
him
as
he
thought
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
the
following
ejaculations
jack
i
onhappy
exclaimed
he
distressed
continued
he
wretched
added
he
slapping
his
knees
perfectly
he
concluded
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
the
matter
asked
jack
who
was
himself
illustration
his
lordship
and
jack
that
mister
something
he
be
the
death
of
me
observed
his
lordship
thought
so
replied
jack
the
chap
been
after
now
dreamt
he
killed
old
lablache
best
hound
i
have
replied
his
lordship
be
grunted
jack
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
he
be
this
and
he
be
that
but
i
can
tell
you
what
that
fellow
is
going
to
be
a
very
awkward
customer
a
terrible
thorn
in
my
side
grunted
jack
who
did
see
how
mischief
about
that
fellow
continued
his
lordship
pouring
himself
out
half
a
tumbler
of
gin
and
filling
it
up
with
water
mischief
about
the
fellow
i
do
like
his
looks
i
do
like
his
coat
i
do
like
his
boots
i
do
like
anything
about
him
i
rather
see
the
back
of
him
than
the
front
he
must
be
got
rid
of
added
his
lordship
i
did
my
best
i
sure
replied
jack
was
deuced
near
wanting
the
patent
coffin
you
were
so
good
as
to
promise
me
did
your
work
well
replied
his
lordship
did
your
work
well
and
you
shall
have
my
other
specs
till
i
can
get
you
a
new
pair
from
town
and
if
you
serve
me
again
i
remember
you
in
my
will
i
leave
you
something
handsome
your
man
replied
jack
never
was
so
bothered
with
a
fellow
in
my
life
observed
his
lordship
topsawyer
was
bad
enough
and
always
pressed
far
too
close
on
the
hounds
but
he
would
pull
up
at
a
check
but
this
seems
to
think
the
hounds
are
kept
for
him
to
ride
over
he
must
be
got
rid
of
somehow
repeated
his
lordship
we
shall
have
no
peace
while
here
he
after
either
of
the
jawley
girls
he
be
bad
to
shake
off
observed
jack
just
the
point
replied
his
lordship
quaffing
off
his
gin
with
the
air
of
a
man
most
thoroughly
thirsty
just
the
point
repeated
he
setting
down
his
tumbler
think
if
he
is
i
could
cook
his
goose
for
him
so
asked
jack
drinking
off
his
glass
i
tell
you
replied
his
lordship
replenishing
his
tumbler
and
passing
the
old
blue
bottle
over
to
jack
see
a
cunning
old
file
picks
up
all
the
news
and
gossip
of
the
country
when
he
out
at
exercise
with
the
hounds
or
in
going
to
cover
knows
everything
who
licks
his
wife
and
whose
wife
licks
him
who
after
such
a
girl
and
so
on
and
he
found
out
somehow
that
this
is
the
man
of
metal
he
passing
for
exclaimed
jack
raising
his
eyebrows
and
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
jack
opinion
of
a
man
being
entirely
regulated
by
his
purse
a
fact
said
his
lordship
with
a
knowing
shake
of
his
head
we
were
toddling
home
with
the
hounds
i
said
to
frosty
i
hope
that
something
comfortable
in
his
bath
meaning
gobblecow
bog
which
he
rode
into
why
said
frosty
it
no
great
odds
what
comes
of
such
rubbage
as
that
now
frosty
you
know
in
a
general
way
is
a
most
polite
man
specially
before
christmas
when
he
begins
to
look
for
the
tips
and
as
we
are
not
much
troubled
with
strangers
thanks
to
your
sensible
way
of
handling
them
i
thought
frosty
would
have
made
the
most
of
this
natural
son
of
dives
and
been
as
polite
to
him
as
possible
however
he
was
evidently
no
favourite
of
frosty
so
i
just
asked
not
that
one
likes
to
be
familiar
with
servants
you
know
but
still
this
beggar
is
enough
to
excite
one
curiosity
and
make
any
one
go
out
of
way
a
little
so
i
just
asked
frosty
what
he
knew
about
him
all
over
the
left
said
frosty
jerking
his
thumb
back
over
his
shoulder
and
looking
as
knowing
as
a
goose
with
one
eye
all
over
the
left
repeated
he
what
over
the
left
said
i
why
this
sponge
said
he
how
so
asked
i
why
said
frosty
he
come
gammonin
down
here
that
he
a
great
man
full
of
money
and
horses
and
so
on
but
it
all
my
eye
no
more
a
great
man
than
i
am
deuce
exclaimed
jack
who
had
sat
squinting
and
listening
intently
as
his
lordship
proceeded
now
hang
me
i
thought
he
was
a
snob
the
moment
i
saw
him
continued
he
jack
being
one
of
those
clever
gentlemen
who
know
everything
after
they
are
told
well
how
do
you
know
jack
said
i
to
frosty
oh
i
knows
replied
he
as
if
he
was
certain
about
it
however
i
was
satisfied
without
knowing
too
and
as
we
kept
jogging
on
we
came
to
the
old
coach
and
horses
and
i
said
to
jack
we
may
as
well
have
a
drop
of
something
to
warm
us
so
we
halted
and
had
glasses
of
brandy
apiece
whips
and
all
and
then
as
we
jogged
on
again
i
just
said
to
jack
casually
did
you
say
it
was
blossomnose
told
you
about
old
brown
boots
no
blossomnose
no
replied
he
as
if
blossom
never
had
anything
half
so
good
to
tell
it
was
a
young
woman
said
he
in
an
undertone
who
told
me
and
she
had
it
from
old
brown
boots
groom
that
good
observed
jack
diving
his
hands
into
the
very
bottom
of
his
great
tartan
trouser
pockets
and
shooting
his
legs
out
before
him
that
good
repeated
he
falling
into
a
sort
of
reverie
but
what
can
we
make
of
it
at
length
inquired
he
after
a
long
pause
during
which
he
ran
the
facts
through
his
mind
and
thought
they
could
not
be
much
ruder
to
sponge
than
they
had
been
can
we
make
of
it
said
he
fellow
can
ride
and
we
ca
prevent
him
hunting
and
his
having
nothing
only
makes
him
less
careful
of
his
neck
that
was
just
what
i
thought
replied
lord
scamperdale
taking
another
tumbler
of
gin
was
just
what
i
thought
the
fellow
can
ride
and
we
ca
prevent
him
and
just
as
i
settled
that
in
my
sleep
i
thought
i
saw
him
come
staring
along
with
his
great
brown
horse
head
in
the
air
and
crash
right
of
old
lablache
but
i
see
my
way
clearer
with
him
now
but
help
yourself
continued
his
lordship
passing
the
over
to
jack
feeling
that
what
he
had
to
say
required
a
little
recommendation
think
i
can
turn
frosty
information
to
some
account
do
see
how
observed
jack
replenishing
his
glass
do
though
replied
his
lordship
adding
i
must
have
your
assistance
anything
in
moderation
replied
jack
who
had
had
to
turn
his
hand
to
some
very
queer
jobs
occasionally
tell
you
what
think
observed
his
lordship
think
there
are
two
ways
of
getting
rid
of
this
haughty
philistine
this
unclean
spirit
this
of
a
man
i
think
in
the
first
place
if
old
chatterbox
knew
that
he
had
nothing
he
would
very
soon
bow
him
out
of
jawleyford
court
and
in
the
second
that
we
might
get
rid
of
him
by
buying
his
horses
replied
jack
do
know
but
you
right
chatterbox
would
soon
wash
his
hands
of
him
as
he
has
done
of
many
promising
young
gentlemen
before
if
he
has
nothing
but
people
differ
so
in
their
ideas
of
what
nothing
consists
of
jack
spoke
feelingly
for
he
was
a
gentleman
who
was
generally
spoken
of
as
having
nothing
a
year
paid
quarterly
and
yet
he
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
an
annuity
of
sixty
pounds
why
when
i
say
he
has
nothing
replied
lord
scamperdale
mean
that
he
has
not
what
jawleyford
who
is
a
bumptious
sort
of
an
ass
would
consider
sufficient
to
make
him
a
fit
match
for
one
of
his
daughters
he
may
have
a
few
hundreds
a
year
but
jaw
i
sure
will
look
at
nothing
under
thousands
certainly
not
said
jack
no
doubt
about
that
then
you
see
i
was
thinking
observed
lord
scamperdale
eyeing
jack
countenance
if
you
would
dine
there
as
we
fixed
dash
it
i
could
do
that
interrupted
jack
drawing
himself
together
in
his
chair
like
a
horse
refusing
a
leap
could
do
that
i
could
dine
with
jaw
not
at
no
price
not
asked
lord
scamperdale
give
you
a
good
dinner
fricassees
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
far
finer
fare
than
you
have
here
may
all
be
replied
jack
i
do
want
none
of
his
food
i
hate
the
sight
of
the
fellow
and
detest
him
fresh
every
time
i
see
him
consider
too
you
said
you
let
me
off
if
i
sarved
out
sponge
and
sure
i
did
my
best
i
led
him
over
some
awful
places
and
then
what
a
ducking
i
got
my
ears
are
full
of
water
still
added
he
laying
his
head
on
one
side
to
try
to
run
it
out
did
well
observed
lord
scamperdale
did
well
and
i
fully
intended
to
let
you
off
but
then
i
did
know
what
a
beggar
i
had
to
deal
with
come
say
you
go
that
a
good
fellow
replied
jack
squinting
frightfully
me
observed
lord
scamperdale
well
i
do
anything
to
oblige
your
lordship
replied
jack
thinking
of
the
corner
in
the
will
do
anything
to
oblige
your
lordship
but
the
fact
is
sir
i
not
prepared
to
go
i
lost
my
specs
i
got
no
swell
clothes
i
ca
go
in
the
stunner
tartan
added
he
eyeing
his
chest
and
diving
his
hands
into
the
capacious
pockets
of
his
illustration
manage
all
that
replied
his
lordship
got
a
pair
of
splendid
spectacles
in
the
indian
cabinet
in
the
that
i
kept
to
be
married
in
i
lend
them
to
you
and
there
no
saying
but
you
may
captivate
miss
jawleyford
in
them
then
as
to
clothes
my
new
velvet
waistcoat
with
the
steel
buttons
and
my
fine
blue
coat
with
the
velvet
collar
silk
facings
and
our
button
on
it
altogether
i
rig
you
out
and
make
you
such
a
swell
as
there
no
saying
but
miss
jawleyford
offer
to
you
by
way
of
consoling
herself
for
the
loss
of
sponge
afraid
you
have
to
make
a
settlement
for
me
then
observed
our
friend
you
are
a
good
fellow
jack
said
his
lordship
i
as
soon
make
one
on
you
as
on
any
one
you
send
me
on
wheels
observed
jack
course
replied
his
lordship
name
behind
right
honourable
the
earl
of
scamperdale
lad
with
cockade
everything
genteel
adding
jove
they
take
you
for
me
having
settled
all
these
matters
and
arranged
how
the
information
was
to
be
communicated
to
jawleyford
the
friends
at
length
took
their
candlesticks
with
their
candles
and
retired

embassy
to
jawleyford
court
illustration
when
sponge
returned
all
dirtied
and
stained
from
the
chase
he
found
his
host
sitting
in
an
over
the
study
fire
and
slippered
with
a
tied
about
his
head
shamming
illness
preparatory
to
putting
off
spraggon
to
be
sure
he
played
rather
a
better
knife
and
fork
at
dinner
than
is
usual
with
persons
with
that
peculiar
ailment
but
sponge
being
very
hungry
and
well
attended
to
by
the
fair
moreover
not
suspecting
any
ulterior
design
just
ate
and
jabbered
away
as
usual
with
the
exception
of
omitting
his
sick
in
the
round
of
his
observations
so
the
dinner
passed
over
me
a
tumbler
and
some
hot
water
and
sugar
said
jawleyford
pressing
his
head
against
his
hand
as
spigot
having
placed
some
bottle
ends
on
the
table
and
reduced
the
glare
of
light
was
preparing
to
retire
me
some
hot
water
and
sugar
said
he
tell
harry
he
will
have
to
go
over
to
lord
scamperdale
with
a
note
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
young
ladies
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
mamma
who
seeing
what
was
wanted
looked
at
papa
and
asked
he
was
going
to
ask
lord
scamperdale
over
amelia
among
her
many
had
long
enjoyed
one
that
she
was
destined
to
be
lady
scamperdale
no
snapped
jawleyford
should
put
that
in
your
head
i
thought
as
sponge
was
here
you
might
think
it
a
good
time
to
ask
him
lordship
knows
he
can
come
when
he
likes
replied
jawleyford
adding
to
put
that
john
spraggon
off
who
thinks
he
may
do
the
same
spraggon
exclaimed
both
the
young
ladies
spraggon
what
should
set
him
here
indeed
asked
jawleyford
man
i
dare
say
there
no
harm
in
him
observed
jawleyford
who
was
always
ready
for
anybody
good
either
replied
jawleyford
all
events
we
be
just
as
well
without
him
you
know
him
do
you
added
he
turning
to
sponge
coarse
man
in
spectacles
yes
i
know
him
replied
sponge
great
ruffian
he
is
too
added
he
ought
to
be
in
robust
health
to
encounter
such
a
man
observed
jawleyford
have
time
to
get
a
man
or
two
of
the
same
sort
to
meet
him
can
do
nothing
with
such
a
man
i
ca
understand
how
his
lordship
puts
up
with
such
a
fellow
him
useful
i
suppose
observed
sponge
spigot
presently
appeared
with
a
massive
silver
salver
bearing
tumblers
sugar
lemon
nutmeg
and
other
implements
of
negus
you
join
me
in
a
little
asked
jawleyford
pointing
to
the
apparatus
and
bottle
ends
will
you
have
a
fresh
bottle
plenty
in
the
cellar
added
he
with
a
flourish
of
his
hand
though
he
kept
looking
steadfastly
at
the
why
i
afraid
i
doubt
i
think
i
should
hardly
be
able
to
do
justice
to
a
bottle
replied
sponge
have
negus
said
jawleyford
find
it
very
refreshing
medical
men
recommend
it
after
violent
exercise
in
preference
to
wine
but
pray
have
wine
if
you
prefer
it
well
i
finish
off
with
a
little
negus
perhaps
replied
sponge
adding
the
ladies
i
dare
say
would
like
a
little
wine
ladies
drink
white
wine
sherry
rejoined
jawleyford
determined
to
make
a
last
effort
to
save
his
port
you
can
have
a
bottle
of
port
to
yourself
you
know
well
said
sponge
condition
i
must
attach
said
jawleyford
is
that
you
the
bottle
do
let
us
have
any
waste
you
know
do
my
best
said
sponge
determined
to
have
it
whereupon
jawleyford
growled
the
word
to
the
butler
who
had
been
witnessing
his
master
efforts
to
direct
attention
to
the
negus
thwarted
in
his
endeavour
jawleyford
headache
became
worse
and
the
ladies
seeing
how
things
were
going
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
leaving
our
hero
to
his
fate
leave
a
note
on
my
when
i
go
to
bed
observed
jawleyford
to
spigot
as
the
latter
was
retiring
after
depositing
the
bottle
tell
harry
to
start
with
it
early
in
the
morning
so
as
to
get
to
woodmansterne
about
breakfast
nine
or
so
at
latest
added
he
sir
replied
spigot
withdrawing
with
an
air
sponge
then
wanted
to
narrate
the
adventures
of
the
day
but
independently
of
jawleyford
natural
indifference
for
hunting
he
was
too
much
out
of
humour
at
being
done
out
of
his
wine
to
lend
a
willing
ear
and
after
sundry
sponge
thought
he
might
as
well
think
the
run
over
to
himself
as
trouble
to
put
it
into
words
whereupon
a
long
silence
ensued
interrupted
only
by
the
tinkling
of
jawleyford
spoon
against
his
glass
and
the
bumps
of
the
decanter
as
sponge
helped
himself
to
his
wine
at
length
jawleyford
having
had
as
much
negus
as
he
wanted
excused
himself
from
further
attendence
under
the
plea
of
increasing
illness
and
retired
to
his
study
to
concoct
his
letter
to
jack
at
first
he
was
puzzled
how
to
address
him
if
he
had
been
jack
spraggon
living
in
old
mother
nipcheese
lodgings
at
starfield
as
he
was
when
lord
scamperdale
took
him
by
the
hand
he
would
have
addressed
him
as
sir
or
perhaps
in
the
third
person
jawleyford
presents
his
compliments
to
spraggon
but
as
my
lord
man
jack
carried
a
certain
weight
and
commanded
a
certain
influence
that
he
would
never
have
acquired
of
himself
jawleyford
spoilt
three
sheets
of
crested
and
ciphered
before
he
pleased
himself
with
a
beginning
first
he
had
it
sir
which
he
thought
looked
too
stiff
then
he
had
it
dear
sir
which
he
thought
looked
too
loving
next
he
had
it
spraggon
which
he
considered
as
too
familiar
and
then
he
tried
spraggon
which
he
thought
would
do
thus
he
wrote
spraggon
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
put
you
off
but
since
i
came
in
from
hunting
i
have
been
attacked
with
influenza
which
will
incapacitate
me
from
the
enjoyment
of
society
at
least
for
two
or
three
days
i
therefore
think
the
kindest
thing
i
can
do
is
to
write
to
put
you
off
and
in
the
hopes
of
seeing
both
you
and
my
lord
at
no
distant
day
remain
dear
sir
yours
sincerely
james
jawleyford
john
spraggon
this
he
sealed
with
the
great
seal
of
jawleyford
court
a
coat
of
arms
containing
innumerable
quarterings
and
heraldic
devices
having
then
refreshed
his
memory
by
looking
through
a
bundle
of
bills
and
selected
the
most
threatening
of
the
lawyers
letters
to
answer
the
next
day
he
proceeded
to
keep
up
the
delusion
of
sickness
by
retiring
to
sleep
in
his
our
readers
will
now
have
the
kindness
to
accompany
us
to
lord
scamperdale
time
the
morning
after
the
foregoing
me
love
my
dog
being
a
favourite
saying
of
his
lordship
he
fed
himself
his
friends
and
his
hounds
on
the
same
meal
jack
and
he
were
busy
with
two
great
basins
full
of
porridge
which
his
lordship
diluted
with
milk
while
jack
stirred
his
up
with
hot
dripping
when
the
note
arrived
his
lordship
was
still
in
a
complete
suit
of
the
great
stunner
tartan
but
as
jack
was
going
from
home
he
had
got
himself
into
a
pair
of
his
lordship
leathers
and
new
while
he
wore
the
stunner
jacket
and
waistcoat
to
save
his
lordship
sunday
green
cutaway
with
metal
buttons
and
waistcoat
his
lordship
did
not
eat
his
porridge
with
his
usual
appetite
for
he
had
had
a
disturbed
night
sponge
having
appeared
to
him
in
his
dreams
in
all
sorts
of
forms
and
predicaments
now
jumping
of
him
now
upsetting
jack
now
riding
over
frostyface
now
crashing
among
his
hounds
and
he
awoke
fully
determined
to
get
rid
of
him
by
fair
means
or
foul
buying
his
horses
did
not
seem
so
good
a
speculation
as
blowing
his
credit
at
jawleyford
court
for
independently
of
disliking
to
part
with
his
cash
his
lordship
remembered
that
there
were
other
horses
to
get
and
he
should
only
be
giving
sponge
the
means
of
purchasing
them
the
more
however
he
thought
of
the
jawleyford
project
the
more
satisfied
he
was
that
it
would
do
and
jack
and
he
were
in
a
sort
of
rehearsal
wherein
his
lordship
personated
jawleyford
and
was
showing
jack
who
was
only
a
clumsy
diplomatist
how
to
draw
up
to
the
subject
of
sponge
pecuniary
deficiencies
when
the
dirty
old
butler
came
with
jawleyford
note
here
exclaimed
his
lordship
fearing
from
its
smartness
that
it
was
from
a
lady
here
repeated
he
as
he
inspected
the
direction
it
for
exclaimed
he
chucking
it
over
to
jack
considerably
relieved
by
the
discovery
replied
jack
can
be
writing
to
me
said
he
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
at
the
seal
he
opened
it
court
read
he
the
deuce
can
be
writing
to
me
from
jawleyford
court
when
i
going
there
for
a
guinea
exclaimed
his
lordship
so
muttered
jack
replied
his
lordship
is
exclaimed
jack
reading
spraggon
and
so
on
humbug
muttered
lord
scamperdale
adding
be
bound
he
got
no
more
influenza
than
i
have
observed
jack
sweeping
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
with
which
he
had
been
protecting
his
leathers
off
into
his
pocket
an
end
of
that
go
so
quick
replied
his
lordship
ladling
in
the
porridge
retorted
jack
what
can
you
do
why
to
be
sure
replied
his
lordship
can
i
go
asked
jack
the
sinner
written
to
put
me
off
replied
his
lordship
i
just
send
word
back
by
the
servant
that
you
had
started
before
the
note
arrived
but
that
you
shall
have
it
as
soon
as
you
return
and
you
just
cast
up
there
as
if
nothing
had
happened
so
saying
his
lordship
took
hold
of
the
and
gave
the
bell
a
peal
no
beating
you
observed
jack
bags
now
made
his
appearance
again
the
servant
here
that
brought
this
note
asked
his
lordship
holding
it
up
lord
replied
bags
tell
him
to
tell
his
master
with
my
compliments
that
spraggon
had
set
off
for
jawleyford
court
before
it
came
but
that
he
shall
have
it
as
soon
as
he
returns
you
understand
lord
replied
bags
looking
at
jack
supping
up
the
fat
porridge
and
wondering
how
the
lie
would
go
down
with
harry
who
was
then
discussing
his
master
merits
and
a
horn
of
small
beer
with
the
lad
who
was
going
to
drive
jack
jawleyford
court
was
twenty
miles
from
woodmansterne
as
the
crow
flies
and
any
distance
anybody
liked
to
call
it
by
the
road
the
road
indeed
would
seem
to
have
been
set
out
with
a
view
of
getting
as
many
hills
and
as
little
level
ground
over
which
a
traveller
could
make
play
as
possible
and
where
it
did
not
lead
over
the
tops
of
the
highest
hills
it
wound
round
their
bases
in
such
little
vexatious
wavy
dips
as
completely
to
do
away
with
all
chance
of
expedition
the
route
was
not
along
one
continuous
trust
but
here
over
a
bit
of
turnpike
and
there
over
a
bit
of
turnpike
with
ever
and
anon
long
interregnums
of
township
roads
repaired
in
the
usual
primitive
style
with
mud
and
soft
that
turned
up
like
flitches
of
bacon
a
man
would
travel
from
london
to
exeter
by
rail
in
as
short
a
time
and
with
far
greater
ease
than
he
would
drive
from
lord
scamperdale
to
jawleyford
court
his
lordship
being
aware
of
this
fact
and
thinking
moreover
it
was
no
use
trashing
a
good
horse
over
such
roads
had
desired
frostyface
to
put
an
old
spavined
grey
mare
that
he
had
bought
for
the
kennel
into
the
and
out
of
which
his
lordship
thought
if
he
could
get
a
day
work
or
two
she
would
come
all
the
cheaper
to
the
boiler
a
beast
observed
his
lordship
as
she
now
came
hitching
round
to
the
door
really
think
she
would
make
a
cover
hack
you
ride
her
than
me
replied
jack
seeing
his
lordship
was
coming
the
dealer
over
him
praising
the
shape
when
he
could
say
nothing
for
the
action
but
she
take
you
to
jawleyford
court
as
quick
as
the
best
of
them
rejoined
his
lordship
adding
roads
are
wretched
and
stables
are
a
disgrace
to
humanity
might
as
well
put
a
horse
in
a
cellar
observed
jack
retiring
from
the
parlour
window
to
his
little
den
along
the
passage
to
put
the
finishing
touch
to
his
toilet
the
green
cutaway
and
buff
waistcoat
which
he
further
set
off
with
a
black
satin
stock
said
he
must
when
a
certain
gentleman
drives
he
presently
reappeared
full
fig
rubbing
a
fine
new
hat
round
and
round
with
a
substantial
bandana
for
the
specs
exclaimed
he
with
the
gaiety
of
a
man
in
his
sunday
best
bound
on
a
holiday
trip
for
the
silver
specs
repeated
he
true
replied
his
lordship
forgot
the
specs
he
had
only
he
thought
his
ones
would
be
safer
in
his
keeping
than
in
jack
forgot
the
specs
however
never
mind
you
shall
have
these
said
he
taking
his
ones
off
his
nose
and
handing
them
to
jack
illustration
spraggon
embassy
to
jawleyford
court
promised
me
the
silver
ones
observed
our
friend
jack
who
wanted
to
be
smart
i
replied
his
lordship
declare
i
forgot
ah
yes
i
believe
i
did
added
he
with
an
air
of
sudden
enlightenment
pair
upstairs
but
how
the
deuce
to
get
at
them
i
do
know
for
the
key
of
the
indian
cabinet
is
locked
in
the
old
oak
press
in
the
and
the
key
of
the
is
locked
away
in
the
in
the
green
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
the
key
of
the
green
is
in
a
drawer
at
the
bottom
of
the
wardrobe
in
the
and
the
well
never
mind
grunted
jack
interrupting
the
labyrinth
of
lies
dare
say
these
will
do
i
dare
say
these
will
do
putting
them
on
adding
if
you
lend
me
a
shawl
for
my
neck
and
a
mackintosh
my
name
shall
be
make
it
replied
his
lordship
the
distance
you
have
to
go
said
jack
mounting
and
driving
away
will
be
a
blessing
if
we
get
there
observed
jack
to
the
liveried
as
the
old
bag
of
bones
of
a
mare
went
hitching
and
limping
away
she
can
go
when
she
warm
replied
the
lad
taking
her
across
the
ears
with
the
point
of
the
whip
the
wheels
followed
merrily
over
the
sound
hard
road
through
the
park
and
the
gentle
though
almost
imperceptible
fall
of
the
ground
giving
an
impetus
to
the
vehicle
they
bowled
away
as
if
they
had
four
of
the
soundest
freshest
legs
in
the
world
before
them
instead
of
nothing
but
a
between
them
and
eternity
when
however
they
cleared
the
noble
lodge
and
got
upon
the
unscraped
mud
of
the
deepdebt
turnpike
the
pace
soon
slackened
and
instead
of
the
gig
running
away
with
the
old
mare
she
was
fairly
brought
to
her
collar
being
a
game
one
however
she
struggled
on
with
a
trot
till
at
length
turning
up
the
deeply
spurlinged
clayey
bottomed
between
rookgate
and
clamley
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
drag
the
gig
through
the
holding
mire
bump
bump
jolt
jolt
creak
creak
went
the
vehicle
jack
now
diving
his
elbow
into
the
lad
ribs
the
lad
now
diving
his
into
jack
both
now
threatening
to
go
over
on
the
same
side
and
again
both
nearly
chucked
on
to
the
old
mare
quarters
a
sharp
cutting
sleet
driving
pins
and
needles
directly
in
their
faces
further
disconcerted
our
travellers
jack
felt
acutely
for
his
new
hat
it
being
the
only
article
of
dress
he
had
on
of
his
own
long
and
tedious
as
was
the
road
weak
and
jaded
as
was
the
mare
and
long
as
jack
stopped
at
starfield
he
yet
reached
jawleyford
court
before
the
messenger
harry
as
our
friend
jawleyford
was
stamping
about
his
study
anathematizing
a
letter
he
had
received
from
the
solicitor
to
the
directors
of
the
doembrown
and
sinkall
railway
informing
him
that
they
were
going
to
indulge
in
the
act
he
chanced
to
look
out
of
his
window
just
as
the
contracted
limits
of
a
winter
day
were
drawing
the
first
folds
of
night
muslin
curtain
over
the
landscape
when
he
espied
a
gig
drawn
by
a
white
horse
with
a
sort
of
action
hopping
its
way
up
the
slumpey
avenue
buggins
the
bailiff
exclaimed
he
to
himself
as
the
recollection
of
an
unanswered
lawyer
letter
flashed
across
his
mind
and
he
was
just
darting
off
to
the
bell
to
warn
spigot
not
to
admit
any
one
when
the
cockade
standing
in
relief
against
the
caused
him
to
pause
and
gaze
again
at
the
unwonted
apparition
the
deuce
can
it
be
asked
he
of
himself
looking
at
his
watch
and
seeing
it
was
a
four
surely
ca
be
my
lord
or
that
jack
spraggon
coming
after
all
added
he
drawing
out
a
telescope
and
opening
a
as
i
live
exclaimed
he
as
he
caught
jack
harsh
spectacled
features
and
saw
him
titivating
his
hair
and
arranging
his
collar
and
stock
as
he
approached
that
beats
everything
exclaimed
jawleyford
burning
with
rage
as
he
fastened
the
window
again
he
stood
for
a
few
seconds
transfixed
to
the
spot
not
knowing
what
on
earth
to
do
at
last
resolution
came
to
his
aid
and
rushing
upstairs
to
his
he
quickly
divested
himself
of
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
slipped
on
a
and
he
then
stood
door
in
hand
listening
for
the
arrival
he
could
just
hear
the
gig
grinding
under
the
portico
and
distinguish
jack
gruff
voice
saying
to
the
servant
from
the
top
of
the
steps
start
after
breakfast
mind
a
tremendous
peal
of
the
bell
immediately
followed
convulsing
the
whole
house
for
nobody
had
seen
the
vehicle
approaching
and
the
establishment
had
fallen
into
the
usual
state
of
undress
torpor
that
intervenes
between
calling
hours
and
the
bell
not
being
answered
as
quickly
as
jack
expected
he
just
opened
the
door
himself
and
when
spigot
arrived
with
such
a
force
as
he
could
raise
at
the
moment
jack
was
in
the
act
of
himself
as
he
called
it
time
do
we
dine
asked
he
with
the
air
of
a
man
with
the
entrée
my
lord
that
to
say
sir
that
to
say
my
lord
for
spigot
really
did
know
whether
it
was
jack
or
his
master
muttered
jack
the
deuce
is
the
use
of
dinin
at
such
an
hour
as
that
in
winter
jack
and
my
lord
always
dined
as
soon
as
they
got
home
from
hunting
jack
having
got
himself
out
of
his
wraps
and
run
his
bristles
backwards
with
a
was
ready
for
presentation
name
shall
i
asked
mr
spigot
fearful
of
committing
himself
before
the
ladies
spraggon
to
be
sure
exclaimed
jack
thinking
because
he
knew
who
he
was
that
everybody
else
ought
to
know
too
spigot
then
led
the
way
to
the
the
peal
at
the
bell
had
caused
a
suppressed
commotion
in
the
apartment
buried
in
the
luxurious
depths
of
a
low
chair
sponge
sat
in
hand
with
a
toe
cocked
up
now
dipping
leisurely
into
his
work
now
whispering
something
sweet
into
amelia
ear
who
sat
with
her
at
his
side
while
emily
played
the
piano
and
jawleyford
kept
in
the
background
in
the
discreet
way
mothers
do
when
there
is
a
little
business
going
on
the
room
was
in
that
happy
state
of
misty
light
that
usually
precedes
the
entrance
of
candles
a
light
that
no
one
likes
to
call
darkness
lest
their
eyes
might
be
supposed
to
be
failing
it
is
a
convenient
light
however
for
a
timid
stranger
especially
where
there
are
not
many
footstools
set
to
trip
him
up
an
exemption
we
grieve
to
say
not
accorded
to
every
one
though
spraggon
was
such
a
cool
impudent
fellow
with
men
he
was
the
most
awkward
frightened
wretch
among
ladies
that
ever
was
seen
his
conversation
consisted
principally
of
coughing
cough
mum
hem
cough
cough
day
hem
cough
is
hem
cough
hem
cough
cold
but
we
will
introduce
him
to
our
family
circle
spraggon
exclaimed
spigot
in
a
tone
equal
to
the
one
in
which
jack
had
announced
himself
in
the
entrance
and
forthwith
there
was
such
a
stir
in
the
twilit
apartment
such
suppressed
exclamations
of
spraggon
mr
spraggon
what
can
bring
him
here
our
traveller
creaking
boots
and
radiant
leathers
eclipsing
the
sombre
habiliments
of
mr
spigot
jawleyford
quickly
rose
from
her
pembroke
and
proceeded
to
greet
him
daughters
i
think
you
know
spraggon
also
sponge
spraggon
continued
she
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
to
where
our
hero
was
ensconced
in
his
form
in
case
they
should
not
have
made
each
speaking
acquaintance
the
young
ladies
rose
and
curtsied
prettily
while
sponge
gave
a
sort
of
backward
hitch
of
his
head
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
as
much
as
to
say
know
as
much
of
spraggon
as
i
want
your
master
spraggon
is
here
added
jawleyford
to
spigot
as
that
worthy
was
leaving
the
room
a
cold
day
spraggon
you
come
near
the
fire
continued
jawleyford
addressing
our
friend
who
had
come
to
a
full
stop
just
under
the
chandelier
in
the
centre
of
the
room
cough
hem
thank
ye
mum
muttered
jack
not
hem
cough
cold
thank
ye
mum
his
face
and
hands
were
purple
notwithstanding
is
my
lord
scamperdale
asked
amelia
who
had
a
strong
inclination
to
keep
in
with
all
parties
cough
hem
my
lord
that
to
say
my
lady
hem
cough
i
mean
to
say

coming
asked
amelia

with

friend
lord
bubbley
jock
hem
cough
i
mean
barker
cough
jack
and
lord
scamperdale
were
so
in
the
habit
of
calling
his
lordship
by
this
nickname
that
jack
let
it
slip
or
rather
cough
out
inadvertently
in
due
time
spigot
returned
with
compliments
and
he
was
very
sorry
but
he
was
so
unwell
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
see
any
one
dear
exclaimed
jawleyford
pa
lisped
amelia
a
pity
observed
sponge
must
go
and
see
him
observed
jawleyford
hurrying
off
cough
hem
hope
he
not
much
hem
damaged
observed
jack
the
old
lady
being
thus
got
rid
of
and
jawleyford
disposed
of
apparently
for
the
night
spraggon
felt
more
comfortable
and
presently
yielded
to
amelia
entreaties
to
come
near
the
fire
and
thaw
himself
spigot
brought
candles
and
sponge
sat
moodily
in
his
chair
alternately
studying
cab
bailey
newgate
street
to
or
from
the
adelphi
the
terrace
admiralty
and
so
on
and
hazarding
promiscuous
sidelong
sort
of
observations
that
might
be
taken
up
by
jack
or
not
as
he
liked
he
seemed
determined
to
pay
jack
off
for
his
impudence
amelia
on
the
other
hand
seemed
desirous
of
making
up
for
her
suitor
rudeness
and
kept
talking
to
jack
with
an
assiduity
that
perfectly
astonished
her
sister
who
had
always
heard
her
speak
of
him
with
the
utmost
abhorrence
jawleyford
found
her
husband
in
a
desperate
state
of
excitement
his
influenza
being
greatly
aggravated
by
harry
having
returned
very
drunk
with
the
mare
knees
desperately
broken
a
fall
as
harry
hiccuped
out
or
by
his
her
down
as
jawleyford
declared
horses
with
their
masters
servants
them
down
what
a
happiness
it
is
when
people
can
send
their
servants
on
errands
by
coaches
or
railways
instead
of
being
kept
on
the
fidget
all
day
lest
a
horse
should
be
the
price
of
a
bodkin
or
a
basket
of
fish
amelia
condescension
quite
turned
jack
head
and
when
he
went
upstairs
to
dress
he
squinted
at
his
lordship
best
clothes
all
neatly
laid
out
for
him
on
the
bed
with
inward
satisfaction
at
having
brought
them
me
said
he
really
think
that
girl
has
a
fancy
for
me
then
he
examined
himself
minutely
in
the
glass
brushed
his
whiskers
up
into
a
curve
on
his
cheeks
the
curves
almost
corresponding
with
the
curve
of
his
spectacles
above
then
he
gave
his
bristly
head
a
backward
rub
with
a
sort
of
thing
like
a
i
only
had
the
silver
specs
thought
he
should
have
done
he
then
began
to
dress
an
operation
that
ever
and
anon
was
interrupted
by
the
outburst
of
volleys
of
smoke
from
the
little
spluttering
smouldering
fire
in
the
little
shabby
room
jawleyford
insisted
on
having
him
put
into
jack
tried
all
things
opening
the
window
and
shutting
the
door
shutting
the
window
and
opening
the
door
but
finding
that
instead
of
curing
it
he
only
produced
the
different
degrees
of
comparison
bad
worse
worst
he
at
length
shut
both
and
applied
himself
vigorously
to
dressing
he
soon
got
into
his
stockings
and
pumps
also
his
black
saxony
trousers
then
came
a
fine
black
laced
fringe
cravat
and
the
velvet
waistcoat
with
the
buttons
me
but
i
look
pretty
well
in
this
said
he
eyeing
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
as
he
buttoned
it
he
then
stuck
a
chased
and
figured
fine
gold
brooch
with
two
pendant
set
with

that
he
had
abstracted
from
his
lordship
into
his
or
rather
his
lordship
finely
worked
and
crowned
the
toilet
with
his
lordship
best
new
blue
coat
with
velvet
collar
silk
facings
and
the
flat
hat
hunt
button
striding
fox
with
the
letters
below
shall
say
spraggon
not
a
gentleman
said
he
as
he
perfumed
one
of
his
lordship
fine
coronetted
cambric
handkerchiefs
with
scent
in
jack
opinion
was
one
of
the
criterions
of
a
gentleman
somehow
jack
felt
quite
differently
towards
the
house
of
jawleyford
and
though
he
did
not
expect
much
pleasure
in
sponge
company
he
thought
nevertheless
that
the
ladies
and
he
amelia
and
he
at
least
would
get
on
very
well
forgetting
that
he
had
come
to
eject
sponge
on
the
score
of
insufficiency
he
really
began
to
think
he
might
be
a
very
desirable
match
for
one
of
them
himself
spraggons
are
a
most
respectable
family
said
he
eyeing
himself
in
the
glass
not
very
handsome
at
all
events
very
genteel
added
he
speaking
of
himself
in
particular
so
saying
he
adorned
himself
with
his
spectacles
and
set
off
to
explore
his
way
downstairs
after
divers
mistakes
he
at
length
found
himself
in
the
where
the
rest
of
the
party
being
assembled
they
presently
proceeded
to
dinner
jack
amended
costume
did
not
produce
any
difference
in
behaviour
who
treated
him
with
the
utmost
indifference
in
truth
sponge
had
rather
a
large
balance
against
jack
for
his
impudence
to
him
in
the
field
nevertheless
the
fair
amelia
continued
her
attentions
and
talked
of
hunting
occasionally
diverging
into
observations
on
lord
fine
riding
and
manly
character
and
appearance
in
the
roundabout
way
ladies
send
their
messages
and
compliments
to
their
friends
the
dinner
was
flat
jawleyford
had
stopped
the
champagne
tap
though
the
glasses
stood
to
tantalize
the
party
till
about
the
time
that
the
beverage
ought
to
have
been
flowing
when
spigot
took
them
off
the
flatness
then
became
flatter
nevertheless
jack
worked
away
in
his
usual
carnivorous
style
and
finished
by
paying
his
respects
to
all
the
sweets
jellies
and
things
in
succession
he
never
got
any
of
these
he
said
at
meaning
at
lord
scamperdale
amelia
thought
if
she
was
lady
he
would
not
get
any
meat
there
either
illustration
enter
jack
spraggon
full
dress
at
length
jack
finished
and
having
discussed
cheese
porter
and
red
herrings
the
cloth
was
drawn
and
a
dessert
consisting
principally
of
apples
followed
the
wine
having
made
a
couple
of
melancholy
circuits
the
strained
conversation
about
came
to
a
full
stop
and
spigot
having
considerately
placed
the
little
round
table
as
if
to
keep
the
peace
between
them
the
ladies
left
the
male
worthies
to
discuss
their
port
and
sherry
together
jack
according
to
woodmansterne
fashion
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
and
stuck
his
legs
out
before
him
an
example
that
sponge
quickly
followed
and
each
assumed
an
attitude
that
as
good
as
said
do
care
twopence
for
you
a
dead
silence
then
prevailed
interrupted
only
by
the
snap
snap
snapping
of
jack
toothpick
against
his
when
he
was
not
busy
exploring
his
mouth
with
it
it
seemed
to
be
a
match
which
should
keep
silence
longest
jack
sat
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
at
sponge
while
sponge
pretended
to
be
occupied
with
the
fire
the
wine
being
with
sponge
and
at
length
wanting
some
he
was
constrained
to
make
the
first
move
by
passing
it
over
to
jack
who
helped
himself
to
port
and
sherry
simultaneously
a
glass
of
sherry
after
dinner
in
jack
opinion
denoting
a
gentleman
having
smacked
his
lips
over
that
he
presently
turned
to
the
glass
of
port
he
checked
his
hand
in
passing
it
to
his
mouth
and
bore
the
glass
up
to
his
nose
by
jove
exclaimed
he
setting
the
glass
down
on
the
table
with
a
thump
of
disgust
it
is
curious
what
unexpected
turns
things
sometimes
take
in
the
world
and
how
completely
whole
trains
of
plans
are
often
turned
aside
by
mere
accidents
such
as
this
if
it
had
been
for
the
corked
bottle
of
port
there
is
no
saying
but
these
two
worthies
would
have
held
a
quakers
meeting
without
the
moving
either
of
them
by
jove
exclaimed
jack
is
rejoined
sponge
smelling
at
his
glass
have
another
bottle
observed
jack
replied
sponge
ringing
the
bell
this
corked
observed
sponge
as
old
pomposo
entered
the
room
it
said
spigot
with
the
most
perfect
innocence
though
he
knew
it
came
out
of
the
corked
batch
bring
another
bottle
added
he
carrying
it
off
as
if
he
had
a
whole
pipe
at
command
though
in
reality
he
had
but
another
out
this
fortunately
was
less
corked
than
the
first
and
jack
having
given
an
approving
smack
of
his
great
thick
lips
sponge
took
it
on
his
judgement
and
gave
a
nod
to
spigot
who
forthwith
took
his
departure
trick
that
observed
jack
with
a
shake
of
the
head
as
spigot
shut
the
door
it
observed
sponge
taking
up
the
observation
though
in
reality
it
was
addressed
to
the
fire
for
it
replied
jack
squinting
at
the
sideboard
though
he
was
staring
intently
at
sponge
to
see
how
he
took
it
i
thought
we
had
a
bottle
with
a
queer
smatch
the
other
night
observed
sponge
blossomnose
corked
half
a
dozen
in
succession
one
night
replied
jack
he
had
corked
three
but
jawleyford
them
and
spigot
was
now
reproducing
them
to
our
friends
although
they
had
now
got
the
ice
broken
and
entered
into
something
like
a
conversation
it
nevertheless
went
on
very
slowly
and
they
seemed
to
weigh
each
word
before
it
was
uttered
jack
too
had
time
to
run
his
peculiar
situation
through
his
mind
and
ponder
on
his
mission
from
lord
scamperdale
on
his
lordship
detestation
of
sponge
his
anxiety
to
get
rid
of
him
his
promised
corner
in
his
will
and
his
lordship
hint
about
buying
sponge
horses
if
he
could
not
get
rid
of
him
in
any
other
way
sponge
on
his
part
was
thinking
if
there
was
any
possibility
of
turning
jack
to
account
it
may
seem
strange
to
the
uninitiated
that
there
should
be
prospect
of
gain
to
a
in
the
matter
of
a
save
in
the
legitimate
trade
of
auctioneers
and
commission
but
we
are
sorry
to
say
we
have
known
men
calling
themselves
gentlemen
who
have
not
thought
it
derogatory
to
accept
a
for
their
good
offices
in
the
cause
can
buy
cheaper
than
you
they
say
we
may
as
well
divide
the
trifle
between
us
that
was
spraggon
principle
only
that
the
word
inadequately
conveys
his
opinion
on
the
point
jack
notion
being
that
a
man
was
entitled
to
per
cent
as
of
right
and
as
much
more
as
he
could
get
it
was
not
often
that
jack
got
a
at
my
lord
which
perhaps
made
him
think
it
the
more
incumbent
on
him
not
to
miss
an
opportunity
having
been
told
of
course
he
knew
exactly
the
style
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with
in
sponge
a
style
of
men
of
whom
there
is
never
any
difficulty
in
asking
if
they
will
sell
their
horses
price
being
the
only
consideration
they
are
indeed
a
sort
of
unlicensed
from
whose
presence
few
hunts
are
wholly
free
spraggon
thought
if
he
could
get
sponge
to
make
it
worth
his
while
to
get
my
lord
to
buy
his
horses
the
whatever
he
might
get
would
come
in
very
comfortably
to
pay
his
christmas
bills
by
the
time
the
bottle
drew
to
a
close
our
friends
were
rather
better
friends
and
seemed
more
inclined
to
fraternize
jack
had
the
advantage
of
sponge
for
he
could
stare
or
rather
squint
at
him
without
sponge
knowing
it
the
pint
of
wine
apiece
at
least
as
near
a
pint
apiece
as
spigot
could
afford
to
let
them
have
somewhat
strung
jack
nerves
as
well
as
his
eyes
and
he
began
to
show
more
of
the
pupils
and
less
of
the
whites
than
he
did
he
buzzed
the
bottle
with
such
a
hearty
good
will
as
settled
the
fate
of
another
which
sponge
rang
for
as
a
matter
of
course
there
was
but
the
rejected
one
which
however
spigot
put
into
a
different
decanter
and
brought
in
with
such
an
air
as
precluded
either
of
them
saying
a
word
in
disparagement
of
it
are
the
hounds
next

jack
oh

unless
the

when
there
an

of
it
at

an

pulling

off

the
stiff
clayey
rides

a
long
way
from

jack

jack
sixteen
from
us
it

a
good
deal
more
from

lordship
will
lay
out
overnight
then
observed
sponge
he
replied
jack
better
care
of
his
sixpences
than
that
up
in
the
dark
breakfast
by
candlelight
grope
our
ways
to
the
stable
and
blunder
along
the
deep
lanes
and
through
all
the
in
the
country
get
there
somehow
or
another
hand
observed
sponge
replied
jack
they
then
paid
their
mutual
respects
to
the
port
hunts
there
on
tuesdays
observed
jack
setting
down
his
glass
that
he
may
have
all
wednesday
to
get
home
in
and
be
sure
of
appearing
on
thursday
there
no
saying
where
he
may
finish
with
a
meet
by
the
time
the
worthies
had
finished
the
bottle
they
had
got
a
certain
way
into
each
other
confidence
the
hint
lord
scamperdale
had
given
about
buying
sponge
horses
still
occupied
jack
mind
and
the
more
he
considered
the
subject
and
the
worth
of
a
corner
in
his
lordship
will
the
more
sensible
he
became
of
the
truth
of
the
old
adage
that
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
lord
thought
jack
fair
but
it
is
a
chance
and
a
remote
one
he
may
live
many
years
as
long
perhaps
longer
than
me
indeed
he
puts
me
on
horses
that
are
anything
but
calculated
to
promote
longevity
then
he
may
marry
a
wife
who
may
eject
me
as
some
wives
do
eject
their
husbands
agreeable
friends
or
he
may
change
his
mind
and
leave
me
nothing
after
all
all
things
considered
jack
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
should
not
be
doing
himself
justice
if
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
such
fair
opportunities
as
chance
placed
in
his
way
and
therefore
he
thought
he
might
as
well
be
picking
up
a
penny
during
his
lordship
life
as
be
waiting
for
a
contingency
that
might
never
occur
indisposition
preventing
jack
making
the
announcement
he
was
sent
to
do
made
it
incumbent
on
him
as
he
argued
to
see
what
could
be
done
with
the
alternative
his
lordship
had
proposed
namely
buying
sponge
horses
at
least
jack
salved
his
conscience
over
with
the
old
plea
of
duty
and
had
come
to
that
conclusion
as
he
again
helped
himself
to
the
last
glass
in
the
bottle
you
like
a
little
claret
asked
sponge
with
all
the
hospitality
of
a
host
hang
your
claret
replied
jack
little
brandy
perhaps
suggested
sponge
should
mind
a
glass
of
brandy
replied
jack
way
of
a
nightcap
spigot
at
this
moment
entering
to
announce
tea
and
coffee
was
interrupted
in
his
oration
by
sponge
demanding
some
brandy
replied
spigot
pretending
to
be
quite
taken
by
surprise
sorry
sir
but
sir
master
sir

sir

him
sir
dash
it
never

that
exclaimed
jack
him

to
make
jack
rather
inarticulate
him

responded
spigot
with
a
shake
of
his
head
as
my
place
sir
is
worth
sir
you
a
little
drop
in
your
pantry
think
you
asked
sponge
perhaps
has
replied
mr
spigot
as
if
it
was
quite
out
of
his
line
go
and
ask
her
said
sponge
bring
some
hot
water
and
things
the
same
as
we
had
last
night
you
know
mr
spigot
retired
and
presently
returned
bearing
a
tray
with
of
a
bottle
of
brandy
which
he
impressed
upon
their
minds
was
the
dare
say
hiccuped
jack
holding
the
bottle
up
to
the
light
she
was
using
it
herself

jack
pouring
a
liberal
potation
into

all

muttered
spigot
to
himself
as
he
sauntered
back
to
his
pantry
jaw
stand
smoking
asked
jack
as
spigot
disappeared
i
should
think
so
replied
sponge
friend
like
you
i
sure
would
be
welcome
sponge
thinking
to
indulge
in
a
cigar
and
lay
the
blame
on
jack
if
you
think
so
said
jack
pulling
out
his
or
rather
his
lordship
and
staggering
to
the
for
a
match
though
there
was
a
candle
at
his
elbow
have
a
pipe
i
said
sponge
you
give
me
a

mine

jack
handing
him
his
lordship
richly
embroidered
case
with
coronets
and
ciphers
on
either
side
the
gift
of
one
of
the
many
lady
scamperdales

light
hiccuped
jack
who
had
now
got
a
end
to
his
said
sponge
availing
himself
of
the
friendly
overture
our
friends
now
whiffed
and
puffed
away
together
whiffing
and
puffing
where
whiffing
and
puffing
had
never
been
known
before
the
brandy
began
to
disappear
pretty
quickly
it
was
better
than

ensued
jack
thinking
whether

should
put
the
question
boldly
as
to
what
sponge
would
give
him
for
effecting
a
sale
or
should
beat
about

a

at

it

bleful
apiece
added
he
helping
himself
to
about
of
what
there
was
taken
your
share
observed
sponge
as
the
bottle
suspended
payment
before
he
got
half
the
quantity
that
jack
had
ee
eze
it
replied
jack
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
working
away
at
an
exhausted
lemon
at
length
they
finished
i
we
may
as
well
go
and
have
some
tea
observed
jack
not
announced
yet
said
sponge
i
make
no
doubt
it
will
be
ready
so
saying
the
worthies
rose
and
after
sundry
bumps
and
certain
irregularities
of
course
they
each
succeeded
in
reaching
the
door
the
passage
lamp
had
died
out
and
filled
the
corridor
with
its
fragrance
sponge
however
knew
the
way
and
the
darkness
favored
the
adjustment
of
cravats
and
the
fingering
of
hair
having
got
up
a
sort
of
drunken
simper
sponge
opened
the
door
expecting
to
find
smiling
ladies
in
a
blaze
of
light
all
however
was
darkness
save
the
expiring
embers
in
the
grate
the
tick
tick
tick
ticking
of
the
clocks
sounded
wonderfully
clear
to
bed
exclaimed
sponge
shrieked
jack
at
the
top
of
his
voice
smatter
gentlemen
what
smatter
exclaimed
spigot
rushing
in
rubbing
his
eyes
with
one
hand
and
holding
a
block
tin
candlestick
in
the
other
replied
jack
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
adding
me
a
devilled
hiccup
know
how
to
do
them
here
sir
snapped
spigot
turkey
leg
though
you
do
you
rascal
rejoined
jack
doubling
his
fists
and
putting
himself
in
posture
pardon
sir
replied
spigot
the
cook
sir
is
gone
to
bed
sir
do
you
know
sir
what
it
is
sir
replied
jack
time
is
it
asked
sponge
minutes
to
two
replied
spigot
holding
up
a
sort
of
pocket
which
he
called
a
watch
deuce
exclaimed
sponge
ha
thought
it
muttered
jack
then
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
go
to
bed
observed
sponge
so
replied
jack
more
to
get
you
know
your
room
asked
sponge
be
sure
i
do
replied
jack
think
i
d
d
dr
drunk
do
you
likely
rejoined
sponge
jack
then
commenced
a
very
ascent
of
the
stairs
which
fortunately
were
easy
or
he
would
never
have
got
up
sponge
who
still
occupied
the
state
apartments
took
leave
of
jack
at
his
own
door
and
jack
went
bumping
and
blundering
on
in
search
of
the
branch
passage
leading
to
his
piggery
he
found
the
green
baize
door
that
usually
distinguishes
the
entrance
to
these
secondary
suites
and
was
presently
lurching
along
its
contracted
passage
as
luck
would
have
it
however
he
got
into
his
where
that
worthy
slept
and
when
jawleyford
jumped
up
in
the
morning
as
was
his
wont
to
see
what
sort
of
a
day
it
was
he
trod
on
jack
face
who
had
fallen
down
in
his
clothes
alongside
of
the
bed
and
jawleyford
broke
jack
spectacles
across
the
bridge
of
his
nose
it
roared
jack
jumping
up
ride
over
a
fellow
that
way
when
shaking
himself
to
try
whether
any
limbs
were
broken
he
found
he
was
in
his
dress
clothes
instead
of
in
the
roomy
garments
of
the
flat
hat
hunt
are
you
where
am
i
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
by
breaking
my
specs
he
exclaimed
squinting
frightfully
at
his
host
dear
sir
exclaimed
jawleyford
from
the
top
of
his
very
sorry
but
your
you
should
ride
so
near
a
man
exclaimed
jack
gathering
up
the
fragments
of
his
spectacles
when
recollecting
himself
he
finished
by
saying
i
better
go
to
my
own
room
you
had
replied
jawleyford
advancing
towards
the
door
to
show
him
the
way
me
have
a
candle
said
jack
preparing
to
follow
my
dear
fellow
why
it
broad
daylight
replied
his
host
it
said
jack
apparently
unconscious
of
the
fact
the
hour
minutes
to
eight
replied
jawleyford
looking
at
a
timepiece
when
jack
got
into
his
own
den
he
threw
himself
into
an
old
invalid
chair
and
sat
rubbing
the
fractured
spectacles
together
as
if
he
thought
they
would
unite
by
friction
though
in
reality
he
was
endeavouring
to
run
the
overnight
proceedings
through
his
mind
the
more
he
thought
of
winning
ways
the
more
satisfied
he
was
that
he
had
made
an
impression
and
then
the
more
vexed
he
was
at
having
his
spectacles
broken
for
though
he
considered
himself
very
presentable
without
them
still
he
could
not
but
feel
that
they
were
a
desirable
addition
then
too
he
had
a
splitting
headache
and
finding
that
breakfast
was
not
till
ten
and
might
be
a
good
deal
later
all
things
considered
he
determined
to
be
off
and
follow
up
his
success
under
more
favourable
auspices
considering
that
all
the
clothes
he
had
with
him
were
his
lordship
he
thought
it
immaterial
which
he
went
home
in
so
to
save
trouble
he
just
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
mackintosh
and
travelled
in
the
dress
ones
he
had
on
illustration
it
was
fortunate
for
sponge
that
he
went
for
when
jawleyford
smelt
the
indignity
that
had
been
offered
to
his
he
broke
out
in
such
a
torrent
of
indignation
as
would
have
been
extremely
unpleasant
if
there
had
not
been
some
one
to
lay
the
blame
on
indeed
he
was
not
particularly
gracious
to
sponge
as
it
was
but
that
arose
as
much
from
certain
dark
hints
that
had
worked
their
way
from
the
servants
hall
into
lady
chamber
as
to
our
friend
pecuniary
resources
and
prospects
jawleyford
began
to
suspect
that
sponge
might
not
be
quite
the
great
he
was
represented
beyond
however
putting
a
few
searching
questions
which
sponge
skilfully
parried
advising
his
daughters
to
be
cautious
lessening
the
number
of
lights
and
lowering
the
scale
of
his
entertainments
generally
jawleyford
did
not
take
any
decided
step
in
the
matter
spraggon
comforted
lord
scamperdale
with
the
assurance
that
amelia
had
no
idea
of
sponge
who
he
made
no
doubt
would
very
soon
be
out
of
the
country
and
his
lordship
went
to
church
and
prayed
most
devoutly
for
him
to
go
chapter
xxvi
and
springwheat
scamperdale
foxhounds
meet
on
monday
at
larkhall
hill
the
flat
hat
hunt
had
relapsed
into
its
wonted
quiet
and
saw
none
but
the
regular
attendants
men
without
the
slightest
particle
of
curve
in
their
hats
hats
indeed
that
looked
as
if
the
owners
sat
upon
them
when
they
had
them
on
their
heads
there
was
fyle
and
fossick
and
blossomnose
and
sparks
and
joyce
and
capon
and
dribble
and
a
few
others
but
neither
washball
nor
puffington
nor
any
of
the
holiday
birds
illustration
his
lordship
has
it
all
to
himself
precisely
at
ten
my
lord
and
his
hounds
and
his
huntsman
and
his
whips
and
his
jack
trotted
round
farmer
springwheat
spacious
back
premises
and
appeared
in
due
form
before
the
green
rails
in
front
attends
us
all
as
the
poet
says
and
if
his
lordship
had
ridden
into
the
yard
and
halloaed
out
for
a
glass
of
springwheat
would
have
trapped
every
fox
on
his
farm
and
the
blooming
springwheat
would
have
had
an
interminable
against
the
hunt
whereas
simply
by
things
pleasant
that
is
to
say
coming
to
breakfast
springwheat
saw
his
corn
trampled
on
nay
led
the
way
over
it
himself
and
springwheat
saw
her
dorkings
disappear
without
a
murmur
unless
indeed
an
inquiry
when
his
lordship
would
be
coming
could
be
considered
in
that
light
larkhall
hill
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
on
a
gentle
eminence
commanding
a
view
over
a
farm
whose
fertile
fields
and
fences
sufficiently
indicated
its
boundaries
and
looked
indeed
as
if
all
the
good
of
the
country
had
come
up
to
it
it
was
green
and
luxuriant
even
in
winter
while
the
strong
stubbles
showed
what
a
crop
there
had
been
turnips
as
big
as
cheeses
swelled
above
the
ground
in
a
little
narrow
dell
whose
existence
was
more
plainly
indicated
from
the
house
by
several
healthy
spindling
larches
shooting
up
from
among
the
green
gorse
was
the
cover
an
almost
certain
find
with
the
almost
equal
certainty
of
a
run
from
it
it
occupied
both
sides
of
the
sandy
dell
through
which
ran
a
sparkling
stream
and
it
possessed
the
great
advantage
to
of
letting
them
see
the
fox
found
larkhall
hill
was
therefore
a
favourite
both
with
horse
and
foot
so
much
good
at
all
events
so
much
land
would
seem
to
justify
a
better
or
more
house
the
present
one
consisting
exclusive
of
the
projecting
garret
ones
in
the
dutch
tile
roof
of
the
usual
four
windows
and
a
door
that
so
well
tell
their
own
tale
passage
in
the
middle
staircase
in
front
parlour
on
the
right
best
ditto
on
the
left
with
rooms
to
correspond
above
to
be
sure
there
was
a
great
depth
of
house
to
the
back
but
this
in
no
way
contributed
to
the
importance
of
the
front
from
which
point
alone
the
springwheats
chose
to
have
it
contemplated
if
the
back
arrangements
could
have
been
divided
and
added
to
the
sides
they
would
have
made
two
very
good
wings
to
the
old
red
brick
mansion
having
mentioned
that
its
colour
was
red
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
add
that
the
door
and
rails
were
green
this
was
a
busy
morning
at
larkhall
hill
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
season
of
my
lord
hounds
meeting
there
and
the
handsome
springwheat
had
had
as
much
trouble
in
overhauling
the
china
and
linen
and
in
dressing
the
children
preparatory
to
breakfast
as
springwheat
had
had
in
collecting
knives
and
forks
and
and
tumblers
for
his
department
of
the
entertainment
to
say
nothing
of
looking
after
his
new
tops
and
cords
hill
as
the
country
people
call
it
was
fig
and
a
bright
balmy
winter
day
softened
the
atmosphere
and
felt
as
though
a
summer
day
had
been
shaken
out
of
its
place
into
winter
it
is
not
often
that
the
english
climate
is
accommodating
enough
to
lend
its
aid
to
set
off
a
place
to
advantage
be
that
however
as
it
may
things
looked
smiling
both
without
and
within
springwheat
by
dint
of
early
rising
and
superintendence
had
got
things
into
such
a
state
of
forwardness
as
to
be
able
to
adorn
herself
with
a
little
jaunty
cap
curious
in
microscopic
punctures
and
ribbon
interlardments
placed
so
far
back
on
her
head
as
to
proclaim
beyond
all
possibility
of
cavil
that
it
was
there
for
ornament
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
the
liberties
of
time
with
her
clearly
parted
hair
liberties
of
time
forsooth
springwheat
was
in
the
heighday
of
womanhood
and
though
she
had
presented
springwheat
with
twins
three
times
in
succession
besides
an
eldest
son
she
was
as
young
and
finely
figured
as
she
was
the
day
she
was
married
she
was
now
dressed
in
a
very
fine
french
grey
merino
with
a
very
small
collar
and
of
course
capacious
muslin
sleeves
the
high
flounces
to
her
dress
set
off
her
smart
waist
to
great
advantage
springwheat
had
got
everything
ready
and
herself
too
by
the
time
lord
scamperdale
second
horseman
rode
into
the
yard
and
demanded
a
stall
for
his
horse
knowing
how
soon
the
balloon
follows
the
pilot
she
immediately
ranged
the
children
in
the
and
as
the
first
whip
rate
sounded
as
he
rode
round
the
corner
she
sank
into
an
by
the
fire
with
a
kerchief
in
the
one
hand
and
the
lane
in
the
other
springey
followed
by
the
heavy
crack
of
a
whip
announced
the
arrival
of
his
lordship
before
the
green
palings
and
a
loud
view
halloa
burst
from
jack
as
the
object
of
inquiry
was
seen
dancing
about
the
room
above
with
his
face
all
flushed
with
the
exertion
of
pulling
on
a
very
tight
boot
in
my
lord
pray
come
in
the
missis
is
below
exclaimed
springwheat
from
the
window
and
just
at
the
moment
the
emerged
from
the
house
and
ran
to
his
lordship
horse
head
his
lordship
and
jack
then
dismounted
and
gave
their
hacks
in
charge
of
the
servant
while
wake
and
fyle
and
archer
who
were
also
of
the
party
scanned
the
countenances
of
the
surrounding
idlers
to
see
in
whose
hands
they
had
best
confide
their
nags
in
lord
scamperdale
stamped
followed
by
his
bold
and
maria
the
maid
being
duly
stationed
in
the
passage
threw
open
the
parlour
door
on
the
left
and
discovered
springwheat
sitting
in
attitude
my
lady
and
how
are
you
exclaimed
his
lordship
advancing
gaily
and
seizing
both
her
pretty
hands
as
she
rose
to
receive
him
declare
you
look
younger
and
prettier
every
time
i
see
you
my
lord
simpered
springwheat
gentlemen
are
always
so
complimentary
a
bit
of
it
exclaimed
his
lordship
eyeing
her
intently
through
his
silver
spectacles
for
he
had
been
obliged
to
let
jack
have
the
other
pair
of
ones
a
bit
of
it
repeated
his
lordship
always
tell
jack
you
are
the
handsomest
woman
in
christendom
do
i
jack
inquired
his
lordship
appealing
to
his
factotum
my
lord
replied
jack
who
always
swore
to
whatever
his
lordship
said
jove
continued
his
lordship
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
i
could
find
such
a
woman
i
marry
her
not
such
women
as
you
to
pick
up
every
day
and
what
a
lot
of
pretty
pups
exclaimed
his
lordship
starting
back
pretending
to
be
struck
with
the
row
of
staring
children
that
what
i
call
a
good
entry
continued
his
lordship
scrutinizing
them
attentively
and
pointing
them
out
to
jack
dogs
all
boys
i
mean
added
he
my
lord
replied
springwheat
laughing
are
girls
laying
her
hand
on
the
heads
of
two
of
them
who
were
now
full
giggle
at
the
idea
of
being
taken
for
boys
they
devilish
handsome
anyhow
replied
his
lordship
thinking
he
might
as
well
be
done
with
the
inspection
springwheat
himself
now
made
his
appearance
as
fine
a
sample
of
a
man
as
his
wife
was
of
a
woman
his
face
was
flushed
with
the
exertion
of
pulling
on
his
tight
boots
and
his
lordship
felt
the
creases
the
hooks
had
left
as
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
springey
said
he
was
just
asking
your
wife
after
the
new
babby
thank
you
my
lord
replied
springey
with
a
shake
of
his
curly
head
you
my
lord
no
new
babbies
my
lord
with
wheat
below
forty
my
lord
but
you
got
a
pair
of
new
boots
at
all
events
observed
his
lordship
eyeing
springwheat
refractory
calves
bagging
over
the
tops
of
them
have
i
replied
springwheat
a
pair
of
uncommon
awkward
tight
customers
they
are
added
he
trying
to
move
his
feet
about
in
them
you
should
always
have
a
chap
to
wear
your
boots
a
few
times
before
you
put
them
on
yourself
observed
his
lordship
never
have
a
pair
of
tight
uns
added
he
here
always
does
the
needful
by
mine
all
very
well
for
lords
replied
springwheat
us
farmers
wear
out
our
boots
fast
enough
ourselves
without
anybody
to
help
us
but
i
we
may
as
well
fall
to
observed
his
lordship
casting
his
eye
upon
the
table
these
good
things
are
meant
to
eat
i
added
he
and
sweets
and
jellies
without
end
and
as
to
your
sideboard
said
he
turning
round
and
looking
at
it
a
match
for
any
lord
mayor

round
of
beef
a
ham
a
tongue
and
is
that
a
goose
or
a
turkey

my
lord
replied
springwheat
my
lord
indeed
ejaculated
his
lordship
with
a
shake
of
the
head
wish
i
could
feed
at
home
the
man
who
said
that
from
the
peasant
to
the
lord
the
turkey
smokes
on
every
board
told
a
big
un
for
i
sure
none
ever
smokes
on
mine
a
little
here
then
observed
springwheat
cutting
deep
into
the
white
breast

replied
his
lordship
will
and
a
slice
of
tongue
too
added
he
are
some
hot
sausingers
comin

springwheat
say
so
replied
his
lordship
apparently
thunderstruck
at
the
announcement
i
must
have
all
three
by
jove
jack
said
he
appealing
to
his
friend
you
lit
on
your
legs
coming

a
breakfast
fit

and

let
me
advise
you
to
make
the
best
use
of
your
time
for

twenty
minutes
continued
his
lordship
looking
at
his
watch

and
crumpets

your
way
every
day
they
do
replied
jack
with
a
grin
your
lordship
take
tea
or
coffee
asked
springwheat
who
had
now
taken
her
seat
at
the
top
of
the
table
behind
a
richly
chased
equipage
for
the
distribution
of
those
beverages
my
word
replied
his
lordship
apparently
bewildered
my
word
i
do
know
what
to
say
tea
or
coffee
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
going
to
take
something
out
of
my
black
friend
yonder
nodding
to
where
a
french
bottle
like
a
tall
bully
was
lifting
its
head
above
an
encircling
stand
of
you
have
a
little
of
what
we
call
laced
tea
my
lord
tea
with
a
dash
of
brandy
in
it
suggested
springwheat
tea
repeated
his
lordship
tea
so
i
will
said
he
good
idea
deuced
good
idea
continued
he
bringing
the
bottle
and
seating
himself
on
springwheat
right
while
his
host
helped
him
to
a
most
plentiful
plate
of
turkey
and
tongue
the
table
was
now
about
full
as
was
the
room
the
guests
just
rolling
in
as
they
would
to
a
and
helping
themselves
to
whatever
they
liked
great
was
the
noise
of
eating
as
his
lordship
was
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
plateful
of
meat
he
happened
to
look
up
and
the
space
between
him
and
the
window
being
clear
he
saw
something
that
caused
him
to
drop
his
knife
and
fork
and
fall
back
in
his
chair
as
if
he
was
shot
lord
ill
exclaimed
springwheat
who
being
the
only
man
with
his
nose
up
was
the
first
to
perceive
it
him
on
the
back
shrieked
springwheat
who
considered
that
an
infallible
recipe
for
the
ailments
of
children
mr
spraggon
exclaimed
both
as
they
rushed
to
his
assistance
is
the
matter
with
my
lord
that
mister
something
gasped
his
lordship
bending
forward
in
his
chair
and
venturing
another
glance
through
the
window
sure
enough
there
was
sponge
in
the
act
of
dismounting
from
the
piebald
and
resigning
it
with
becoming
dignity
to
his
trusty
groom
leather
who
stood
most
respectfully
parvo
in
hand
waiting
to
receive
it
sponge
being
of
opinion
that
a
red
coat
is
a
passport
everywhere
having
stamped
the
mud
sparks
off
his
boots
at
the
door
swaggered
in
with
the
greatest
coolness
exclaiming
as
he
bobbed
his
head
to
the
lady
and
looked
round
at
the
company
grubbing
away
grubbing
away
eh
you
take
a
little
refreshment
asked
springwheat
in
the
hearty
way
these
hospitable
fellows
welcome
everybody
i
will
replied
sponge
turning
to
the
sideboard
as
though
it
were
an
inn
a
monstrous
fine
ham
observed
he
does
somebody
cut
it
me
help
you
to
some
sir
replied
springwheat
seizing
the
knife
and
fork
and
diving
deep
into
the
rich
red
meat
with
the
knife
sponge
having
got
two
bountiful
slices
with
a
knotch
of
brown
bread
and
some
mustard
on
his
plate
now
made
for
the
table
and
elbowed
himself
into
a
place
between
fossick
and
sparks
immediately
opposite
spraggon
morning
said
he
to
that
worthy
as
he
saw
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showing
through
his
spectacles
muttered
jack
as
if
his
mouth
was
either
too
full
to
articulate
or
he
did
want
to
have
anything
to
say
to
sponge
a
fine
hunting
morning
my
lord
observed
sponge
addressing
himself
to
his
lordship
who
sat
on
jack
left
a
very
fine
hunting
morning
my
lord
repeated
sponge
not
getting
an
answer
to
his
first
assertion
it
blurted
his
lordship
pretending
to
be
desperately
busy
with
the
contents
of
his
plate
though
in
reality
his
appetite
was
gone
a
dead
pause
now
ensued
interrupted
only
by
the
clattering
of
knives
and
forks
and
the
occasional
exclamations
of
parties
in
want
of
some
particular
article
of
food
a
chill
had
come
over
the
scene
a
chill
whose
cause
was
apparent
to
every
one
except
the
worthy
host
and
hostess
who
had
not
heard
of
sponge
descent
upon
the
country
they
attributed
it
to
his
lordship
indisposition
and
springwheat
endeavoured
to
cheer
him
up
with
the
prospect
of
sport
a
brace
if
not
a
leash
of
foxes
in
cover
my
lord
observed
he
seeing
his
lordship
was
only
playing
with
the
contents
of
his
plate
there
exclaimed
his
lordship
brightening
up
be

added
he
jumping
up
and
diving
under
the

his
flat
hat
and
heavy
iron
whip

my
dear
springwheat
exclaimed
he
putting
on
his
hat
and
seizing
both
her
soft
hands
and
squeezing
them
ardently
morning
my
dear
springwheat
repeated
he
adding
jove
if
ever
there
was
an
angel
in
petticoats
you
her
i
give
a
hundred
pounds
for
such
a
wife
as

give
a
thousand
pounds
for
such
a
wife
as
you
by
the
powers
i
give
five
thousand
pounds
for
such
a
wife
as
you
with
which
asseverations
his
lordship
stamped
away
in
his
great
clumsy
boots
amidst
the
laughter
of
the
party
hurry
gentlemen
no
hurry
observed
springwheat
as
some
of
the
keen
ones
were
preparing
to
follow
and
began
sorting
their
hats
and
making
the
mistakes
incident
to
their
being
all
the
same
shape
hurry
sir
no
hurry
sir
repeated
springwheat
addressing
sponge
specifically
lordship
will
have
a
talk
to
his
hounds
yet
and
his
horse
is
still
in
the
stable
with
this
assurance
sponge
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
where
several
of
the
hungry
ones
were
plying
their
knives
and
forks
as
if
they
were
indeed
breaking
their
fasts
old
boy
and
how
are
you
asked
sponge
as
the
whites
of
eyes
again
settled
upon
him
on
the
latter
looking
up
from
his
plateful
of
sausages
how
are
you
asked
jack
too
replied
sponge
in
the
laconic
way
men
speak
who
have
been
engaged
in
some
common
enterprise
getting
drunk
pelting
people
with
rotten
eggs
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
the
ladies
well
asked
jack
in
the
same
strain
nicely
said
sponge

glass
of

the
hospitable
springwheat
like
a
drop
of
something
for
steadying
the
nerves
replied
sponge
meanwhile
i
trouble
the
missis
for
a
cup
of
coffee
coffee
without
sugar
said
sponge
addressing
the
lady
pleasure
replied
springwheat
glad
to
get
a
little
custom
for
her
goods
most
of
the
gentlemen
had
been
at
the
bottles
and
sideboard
springwheat
seeing
sponge
the
only
person
who
as
a
stranger
there
was
any
occasion
for
him
to
attend
to
in
the
care
of
his
wife
now
slipped
out
of
the
room
and
mounting
his
horse
whose
tail
stuck
out
like
the
long
horn
of
a
coach
as
his
ploughman
groom
said
rode
off
to
join
the
hunt
the
powers
but
those
are
capital
sarsingers
observed
jack
smacking
his
lips
and
eating
away
for
hard
life

if
my
lord

his
horse
yet
added
he
to
one
of
the
children
who
had
begun
to
hover
round
the
table
and
dive
their
fingers
into
the
sweets
replied
the
child
still
on
foot
playing
with
the
dogs
goes
then
said
jack
another
plate
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
running
with
his
plate
to
the
a
hot
one
exclaimed
springwheat
adding
will
be
done
in
a
minute
thank
ye
replied
jack
with
a
shake
of
the
head
adding

be
done
in
a
minute
too
wait
for
you
i
suppose
observed
sponge
addressing
jack
so
clear
about
that
replied
jack
gobbling
away
and
my
lord
wait
for
no
man
but
it
hardly
the
yet
added
he
looking
at
his
watch
he
then
fell
to
with
the
voracity
of
a
hound
after
hunting
sponge
too
made
the
most
of
his
time
as
did
two
or
three
others
who
still
remained
for
the
at
length
exclaimed
sponge
looking
round
for
the
bottle
shall
it
be
cherry
or
neat
continued
he
pointing
to
the
two
for
me
replied
jack
squinting
and
eating
away
without
looking
up
say
rejoined
sponge
helping
himself
out
of
the
french
bottle
be
hard
to
hold
after
that
observed
jack
as
he
eyed
sponge
tossing
it
off
hope

horse

replied
sponge
remembering
he
was
going
to
ride
the
resolute
chestnut

us
the
way

dare
say
observed
jack

replied
sponge
helping
himself
to
a
second
glass
at
it
again
exclaimed
jack
adding
care

do
ride
over
my
lord
take
care
of
the
old

sponge
would
do
to
kill
the

chuckled
jack

sponge

jack
he

likely
but
that
you
must
mind
i
replied
sponge
who
was
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
must
mind
me
either
observed
jack
sweeping
the
last
piece
of
sausage
into
his
mouth
with
his
knife
and
jumping
up
from
the
table

rushing
to
the
window

responded
jack
standing
transfixed
on
one
leg
to
the
spot

away
exclaimed
sponge
as
his
lordship
was
seen

in
hand
careering
over
the
meadow

straining
to
overtake
their
flying

went
the
ponderous
thongs
of
the

and
yells
and
yelps
and
whoops
and
halloas
proclaimed
the
usual
wild
excitement
of
this
privileged
period
of
the
chase
all
was
joy
save
among
the
gourmands
assembled
at
the
door
they
looked
blank
indeed
a
sell
exclaimed
sponge
in
disgust
who
with
jack
saw
the
hopelessness
of
the
case
he
goes
exclaimed
a
lad
who
had
run
up
from
the
cover
to
see
the
hunt
from
the
rising
ground
exclaimed
sponge

his

who
now
caught
sight
of
the
fox
emerging
from
the
turnips
on
to
a
grass
field
beyond
jack
stood
staring
through
his
great
spectacles
without
deigning
a
word
shall

do
asked
sponge
replied
jack
with
his
chin
still
up
home
i
should
think
a
man
down
exclaimed
a
groom
who
formed
one
of
the
group
as
a

their
length
on
a
pasture

another
adding
always
rolling

setting

preparatory

fourth
as
the

flew
over

without
an

several
as
the
second
whip
went
galloping
up
on
the
line
of
the
gate
he
wo

the
cry
as
the
horse
suddenly
stopped
short
nearly
shooting
tom
over
his
head

a

observed
another
pig

and
so
they
criticized
the
laggers

my
lord
get
his
horse

spraggon
of
the
groom

had
brought
them

the

went
in
on

and
the
horse
went
round

back

the
horse
was
there
half
a
minute
before
he
was
wanted
for
no
sooner
were
the
hounds
in
at
one
end
than
out
popped
the

squinting
frightfully
at
the
man
adding
get
me
my
hack
and
do
be
talking
nonsense
there
our
friends
then
remounted
their
hacks
and
parted
company
in
very
moderate
humours
feeling
fully
satisfied
that
his
lordship
had
done
it
on
purpose

the
finest

was

illustration
jack
exclaimed
lord
scamperdale
bursting
into
his
sanctum
where
spraggon
sat
in
his
hunting
coat
and
slippers
spelling
away
at
a
copy
of
by
the
light
of
a
melancholy
mould
candle
jack
hooray
repeated
he
waving
that
proud
trophy
a
splendid
fox
brush
over
his
grizzly
head
his
lordship
was
the
picture
of
delight
he
had
had
a
tremendous
run
the
finest
run
that
ever
was
seen
his
hounds
had
behaved
to
perfection
his
horse
though
he
had
downed
him
three
times
had
carried
him
well
and
his
lordship
stood
with
his
crownless
flat
hat
in
his
hand
and
one
coat
lap
in
the
pocket
of
the
other
a
grinning
exulting
specimen
of
a
happy
englishman
what
a
sight
you
are
observed
jack
turning
the
light
of
the
candle
upon
his
lordship
dirty
person
i
declare
you
an
inch
thick
with
mud
he
added
from
head
to
foot
he
continued
working
the
light
up
and
down
mind
the
mud
you
old
badger
roared
his
lordship
still
waving
the
brush
over
his
head
mind
the
mud
you
old
badger
the
mud
come
off
or
may
stay
on
but
such
a
run
as
we
had
does
not
come
off
every
day
i
glad
you
have
had
a
run
replied
jack
glad
you
have
had
a
run
adding
was
afraid
at
one
time
that
your
day
sport
was
spoiled
do
you
know
replied
his
lordship
i
saw
that
unrighteous
snob
i
was
near
sick
if
it
were
possible
for
a
man
to
faint
i
should
have
thought
i
was
going
to
do
so
at
first
i
thought
of
going
home
taking
the
hounds
away
too
then
i
thought
of
going
myself
and
leaving
the
hounds
then
i
thought
if
i
left
the
hounds
it
would
only
make
the
sinful
scaramouch
more
outrageous
and
i
should
be
sitting
on
pins
and
needles
till
they
came
home
thinking
how
he
was
crashing
among
them
next
i
thought
of
drawing
all
the
unlikely
places
in
the
country
and
making
a
blank
day
of
it
then
i
thought
that
would
only
be
like
cutting
off
my
nose
to
spite
my
face
then
i
did
know
what
on
earth
to
do
at
last
when
i
saw
the
critter
great
pecker
steadily
down
in
his
plate
i
thought
i
would
try
and
steal
a
march
upon
him
and
get
away
with
my
fox
while
he
was
feeding
and
oh
how
thankful
i
was
when
i
looked
back
from
bramblebrake
hill
and
saw
no
signs
of
him
in
the
distance
was
likely
you
see
him
interrupted
jack
he
never
got
away
from
the
front
door
i
twigged
what
you
were
after
and
kept
him
up
in
talk
about
his
horses
and
his
ridin
till
i
saw
you
were
fairly
away
did
well
exclaimed
lord
scamperdale
patting
jack
on
the
back
did
well
my
old
and
by
jove
we
have
a
bottle
of
port
a
bottle
of
port
as
i
live
repeated
his
lordship
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
a
most
magnificent
act
what
happened
you
behind
what
happened
you
behind
asked
jack
as
his
lordship
turned
to
the
fire
and
exhibited
his
docked
tail
hang
the
coat
it
neither
here
nor
there
replied
his
lordship
neither
he
added
exhibiting
its
crushed
proportions
blossomnose
did
the
coat
and
as
to
the
hat
i
did
it
myself
at
least
old
daddy
longlegs
and
i
did
it
between
us
we
got
into
a
of
which
they
had
cut
a
few
roods
of
fence
just
enough
to
tempt
a
man
out
of
a
very
deep
lane
and
away
we
sailed
in
the
enjoyment
of
fine
sound
sward
with
the
rest
of
the
field
plunging
and
floundering
and
holding
and
grinning
and
thinking
what
fools
they
were
for
not
following
my
example
when
lo
and
behold
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
field
and
found
there
was
no
way
out
no
chance
of
a
bore
through
the
great
thick
high
hedge
except
at
a
branchy
willow
where
there
was
just
enough
room
to
squeeze
a
horse
through
provided
he
did
rise
at
the
ditch
on
the
far
side
at
first
i
was
for
getting
off
indeed
had
my
right
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
when
the
hounds
dashed
forrard
with
such
energy
looking
like
running
and
remembering
the
tremendous
climb
i
should
have
to
get
on
to
old
daddy
back
again
and
seeing
some
of
the
nasty
jealous
chaps
in
the
lane
eyeing
me
through
the
fence
thinking
how
i
was
floored
i
determined
to
stay
where
i
was
and
gathering
the
horse
together
tried
to
squeeze
through
the
hole
well
he
went
shuffling
and
sliding
down
to
it
as
though
he
were
conscious
of
the
difficulty
and
poked
his
head
quietly
past
the
tree
when
getting
a
sight
of
the
ditch
on
the
far
side
he
rose
and
banged
my
head
against
the
branch
above
crushing
my
hat
right
over
my
eyes
and
in
that
position
he
carried
me
through
blindfold
exclaimed
jack
turning
his
spectacles
full
upon
his
lordship
and
adding
lucky
he
did
crack
your
crown
is
assented
his
lordship
feeling
his
head
to
satisfy
himself
that
he
had
not
done
so
how
did
you
lose
your
tail
asked
jack
having
got
the
information
about
the
hat
tail
ah
the
tail
replied
his
lordship
feeling
behind
where
it
was
i
tell
you
how
that
was
you
see
we
went
away
like
blazes
from
springwheat
gorse
nice
gorse
it
is
and
nice
woman
he
has
for
a
wife
but
however
that
neither
here
nor
there
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
was
the
run
and
how
i
lost
my
tail
well
we
got
away
like
winking
no
sooner
were
the
hounds
in
on
one
side
than
away
went
the
fox
on
the
other
not
a
soul
shouted
till
he
was
clean
gone
hats
in
the
air
was
all
that
told
his
departure
the
fox
thus
had
time
to
run
matters
through
his
mind
think
whether
he
should
go
to
ravenscar
craigs
or
make
for
the
main
earths
at
painscastle
grove
he
chose
the
latter
doubtless
feeling
himself
strong
and
full
of
running
and
if
we
had
chosen
his
ground
for
him
he
could
not
have
taken
us
a
finer
line
he
went
as
straight
as
an
arrow
through
bramblebrake
wood
and
then
away
down
the
hill
over
those
great
enormous
pastures
to
haselbury
park
which
he
skirted
leaving
evercreech
green
on
the
left
pointing
as
if
for
dormston
dean
here
he
was
chased
by
a
cur
and
the
hounds
were
brought
to
a
momentary
check
frosty
however
was
well
up
and
a
hat
being
held
up
on
hothersell
hill
he
clapped
forrard
and
laid
the
hounds
on
beyond
we
then
viewed
the
fox
sailing
away
over
eddlethorp
downs
still
pointing
for
painscastle
grove
with
the
hamerton
brook
lighting
up
here
and
there
in
the
distance
field
i
should
tell
you
were
fairly
taken
by
surprise
there
a
man
ready
for
a
start
my
horse
had
only
just
come
down
fossick
was
on
foot
drawing
his
girths
fyle
was
striking
a
light
to
smoke
a
cigar
on
his
hack
blossomnose
and
capon
grooms
were
fistling
and
wisping
their
horses
dribble
as
usual
was
all
behind
and
altogether
there
was
such
a
scene
of
hurry
and
confusion
as
never
was
seen
they
came
to
the
brook
they
got
somewhat
into
line
and
one
saw
who
was
there
five
or
six
of
us
charged
it
together
and
two
went
under
one
was
springwheat
on
his
bay
who
was
somewhat
pumped
out
the
other
was
said
to
be
hook
old
daddy
longlegs
skimmed
it
like
a
swallow
and
getting
his
well
under
him
shot
over
the
pastures
beyond
as
if
he
was
going
upon
turf
the
hounds
all
this
time
had
been
running
or
rather
racing
nearly
mute
they
now
however
began
to
feel
for
the
scent
and
as
they
got
upon
the
cold
bleak
grounds
above
somerton
quarries
they
were
fairly
brought
to
their
noses
uncommon
glad
i
was
to
see
them
for
ten
minutes
more
at
the
pace
they
had
been
going
would
have
shaken
off
every
man
jack
of
us
as
it
was
it
was
bellows
to
mend
and
calcott
roarer
roared
as
surely
roarer
never
roared
before
you
could
hear
him
half
a
mile
off
we
had
barely
time
however
to
turn
our
horses
to
the
wind
and
ease
them
for
a
few
moments
before
the
pace
began
to
mend
and
from
a
catching
to
a
holding
scent
they
again
poured
across
wallingburn
pastures
and
away
to
roughacres
court
it
was
between
these
places
that
i
got
my
head
duntled
into
my
hat
continued
his
lordship
knocking
the
crownless
hat
against
his
knee
i
did
care
a
button
though
i
not
worn
it
above
two
years
and
it
might
have
lasted
me
a
long
time
about
home
but
misfortunes
seldom
come
singly
and
i
was
soon
to
have
another
the
few
of
us
that
were
left
were
all
for
the
lanes
and
very
accommodating
the
one
between
newton
bushell
and
the
bank
was
the
hounds
running
parallel
within
a
hundred
yards
on
the
left
for
nearly
a
mile
when
however
we
got
to
the
old
in
the
fields
below
the
fox
made
a
bend
to
the
left
as
if
changing
his
mind
and
making
for
newtonbroome
woods
and
we
were
obliged
to
try
the
fortunes
of
war
in
the
fields
the
first
fence
we
came
to
looked
like
nothing
and
there
was
a
weak
place
right
in
my
line
that
i
rode
at
expecting
the
horse
would
easily
bore
through
a
few
twigs
that
crossed
the
upper
part
of
it
these
however
happened
to
be
twisted
to
stop
the
gap
and
not
having
put
on
enough
steam
they
checked
him
as
he
rose
and
brought
him
right
down
on
his
head
in
the
broad
ditch
on
the
far
side
old
blossomnose
who
was
following
close
behind
not
making
any
allowance
for
falls
was
in
the
air
before
i
was
well
down
and
his
horse
came
with
a
forefoot
into
my
pocket
and
tore
the
lap
clean
off
by
the
skirt
his
lordship
exhibiting
the
lap
as
he
spoke
your
new
coat
too
observed
jack
examining
it
with
concern
as
he
spoke
is
it
replied
his
lordship
with
a
shake
of
the
head
is
it
that
the
consequence
of
having
gone
out
to
breakfast
if
it
had
been
for
instance
i
should
have
had
number
two
on
or
maybe
number
three
his
lordship
having
coats
of
every
shade
and
grade
from
stainless
scarlet
down
to
tattered
mulberry
colour
mend
however
observed
his
lordship
taking
it
back
from
jack
mend
however
he
said
fitting
it
round
to
the
skirt
as
he
spoke
nicely
replied
jack
come
off
clean
by
the
skirt
but
what
said
old
blossom
inquired
jack
he
was
full
of
apologies
and
could
helps
it
as
usual
replied
his
lordship
was
down
too
i
should
tell
you
with
his
horse
on
his
left
leg
but
there
was
much
time
for
apologies
or
explanation
for
the
hounds
were
running
pretty
sharp
considering
how
long
they
had
been
at
work
and
there
was
the
chance
of
others
jumping
upon
us
if
we
did
get
out
of
the
way
so
we
both
scrambled
up
as
quick
as
we
could
and
got
into
our
places
again
way
did
you
go
then
asked
jack
who
had
listened
with
the
attention
of
a
man
who
knows
every
yard
of
the
country
continued
his
lordship
casting
back
to
where
he
got
his
fall
fox
crossed
the
coatenburn
township
picking
all
the
plough
and
ground
as
he
went
but
it
was
of
no
use
his
fate
was
sealed
and
though
he
began
to
run
short
and
dodge
and
thread
the
they
hunted
him
yard
by
yard
till
he
again
made
an
effort
for
his
life
and
took
over
mossingburn
moor
pointing
for
penrose
tower
on
the
hill
here
frosty
horse
little
jumper
declined
and
we
left
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
with
a
stiff
neck
kicking
and
staring
and
looking
mournfully
at
his
flanks
daddy
longlegs
too
had
begun
to
sob
and
in
vain
i
looked
back
in
hopes
of
seeing
coming
up
well
said
i
to
myself
i
got
a
pair
of
good
strong
boots
on
and
i
finish
the
run
on
foot
but
i
see
it
when
just
at
the
moment
the
pack
broke
from
scent
to
view
and
rolled
the
fox
up
like
a
hedgehog
amongst
them
done
exclaimed
jack
adding
was
a
run
with
a
vengeance
it
replied
his
lordship
rubbing
his
hands
and
stamping
finest
run
that
ever
was
seen
the
finest
run
that
ever
was
seen
it
could
be
less
than
twelve
miles
from
point
to
point
observed
jack
thinking
it
over
a
yard
replied
his
lordship
a
yard
and
from
fourteen
to
fifteen
as
the
hounds
ran
would
be
all
that
assented
jack
long
were
you
in
doing
it
he
asked
hour
and
forty
minutes
replied
his
lordship
hour
and
forty
minutes
from
the
find
to
the
finish
adding
stick
the
brush
and
present
it
to
mrs
springwheat
to
be
hoped
springy
out
of
the
brook
observed
jack
be
hoped
so
replied
his
lordship
thinking
if
he
was
whether
he
should
marry
springwheat
or
not
well
now
after
all
that
we
fancy
we
hear
our
fair
friends
exclaim
goodness
there
an
end
of
lord
scamperdale
and
his
hunting
he
has
had
a
good
run
and
will
rest
quiet
for
a
time
we
shall
now
hear
something
of
amelia
and
emily
and
the
doings
at
jawleyford
court
mistaken
lady
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
marry
an
you
will
find
that
a
good
run
is
only
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
only
making
him
anxious
for
more
lord
scamperdale
sporting
fire
was
in
full
blaze
his
bumps
and
his
thumps
his
rolls
and
his
scrambles
only
brought
out
the
beauties
and
perfections
of
the
thing
he
cared
nothing
for
his
no
nor
for
his
either
nay
he
would
have
cared
if
it
had
been
made
into
a
spencer
monday
said
his
lordship
answering
himself
he
repeated
i
guess
sooner
it
ready
the
better
for
i
did
do
to
that
nice
breakfast
at
springy
that
nasty
buffer
completely
threw
me
off
my
feed
by
the
way
what
became
of
the
animal
home
replied
jack
place
for
him
he
stay
there
rejoined
his
lordship
fear
of
his
being
at
the
roads
is
there
replied
jack
told
him
it
was
quite
an
impossible
distance
from
him
twenty
miles
at
least
grand
exclaimed
his
lordship
grand
then
we
have
a
rare
hey
away
pop
there
be
no
end
of
those
nasty
jealous
puffington
dogs
out
and
if
we
have
half
such
a
scent
as
we
had
we
sew
some
of
them
up
we
show
what
hunting
is
now
he
added
you
go
and
get
the
bottle
of
port
i
clean
myself
and
then
have
dinner
as
quick
as
we
can
chapter
xxviii
the
faithful
groom
we
left
our
friend
sponge
wending
his
way
home
moodily
after
having
lost
his
day
at
larkhall
hill
some
of
our
readers
will
perhaps
say
why
did
he
clap
on
and
try
to
catch
up
the
hounds
at
a
check
or
at
all
events
rejoin
them
for
an
afternoon
fox
gentle
reader
sponge
did
not
hunt
on
those
terms
he
was
a
or
a
man
and
independently
of
catching
hounds
up
being
always
a
fatiguing
and
hazardous
speculation
especially
on
a
day
the
exertion
would
have
taken
more
out
of
his
horse
than
would
have
been
desirable
for
successful
display
in
a
second
run
sponge
therefore
determined
to
go
home
as
he
sauntered
along
musing
on
the
mishaps
of
the
chase
wondering
how
miss
jawleyford
would
look
and
playing
himself
an
occasional
tune
with
his
spur
against
his
stirrup
who
should
come
trotting
behind
him
but
leather
on
the
redoubtable
chestnut
sponge
beckoned
him
alongside
the
horse
looked
blooming
and
bright
his
eye
was
clear
and
cheerful
and
there
was
a
sort
of
springy
graceful
action
that
looked
like
easy
going
one
always
fancies
a
horse
most
with
another
man
on
him
we
see
all
his
good
points
without
feeling
his
imperfections
his
trippings
or
startings
or
snatchings
or
borings
or
roughness
of
action
and
sponge
proceeded
to
make
a
silent
estimate
of
multum
in
parvo
qualities
as
he
trotted
gently
along
on
the
grassy
side
of
the
somewhat
wide
road
jove
it
a
pity
but
his
lordship
had
seen
him
thought
sponge
as
the
emulation
of
companionship
made
the
horse
gradually
increase
his
pace
and
steal
forward
with
the
lightest
freest
action
imaginable
he
was
but
all
right
continued
sponge
with
a
shake
of
the
head
would
be
worth
any
money
for
he
has
the
strength
of
a
with
the
symmetry
and
action
of
a
racer
then
sponge
thought
he
should
have
an
opportunity
of
showing
the
horse
till
thursday
for
jack
had
satisfied
him
that
the
next
day
meet
was
quite
beyond
distance
from
jawleyford
court
a
bore
said
he
rising
in
his
stirrups
and
tickling
the
piebald
with
his
spurs
as
if
he
were
going
to
for
a
race
he
thought
of
having
a
trial
of
speed
with
the
chestnut
up
a
slip
of
turf
they
were
now
approaching
but
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
and
he
desisted
horses
have
done
nothing
he
said
should
i
send
the
chestnut
on
for
you
know
where
the
are
he
asked
his
groom
what
replied
leather
the
hounds
meet
the
at
somethin
burn
rejoined
leather
thoughtfully
i
do
he
added
all
they
seem
to
be
somewhere
on
the
far
side
of
the
world
that
was
not
a
very
encouraging
answer
and
feeling
it
would
require
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
to
induce
leather
to
go
in
search
of
them
without
clothing
and
the
necessary
requirements
for
his
horses
sponge
went
trotting
on
in
hopes
of
seeing
some
place
where
he
might
get
a
sight
of
the
map
of
the
county
so
they
proceeded
in
silence
till
a
sudden
turn
of
the
road
brought
them
to
the
spire
and
housetops
of
the
little
agricultural
town
of
barleyboll
it
differed
nothing
from
the
ordinary
run
of
small
towns
it
had
a
pond
at
one
end
an
inn
in
the
middle
a
church
at
one
side
a
fashionable
milliner
from
london
a
merchant
tailor
from
the
same
place
and
a
hardware
shop
or
two
where
they
also
sold
treacle
dartford
gunpowder
patent
medicines
cheese
blacking
marbles
men
hats
and
other
miscellaneous
articles
it
was
quite
enough
of
a
town
however
to
raise
a
presumption
that
there
would
be
a
map
of
the
county
at
the
inn
just
put
the
horses
up
for
a
few
minutes
i
think
said
sponge
turning
into
the
at
the
end
of
the
red
lion
hotel
and
posting
house
adding
want
to
write
a
letter
and
perhaps
said
he
looking
at
his
watch
may
be
wanting
your
dinner
having
resigned
his
horse
to
his
servant
sponge
walked
in
receiving
the
marked
attention
usually
paid
to
a
red
coat
mine
host
left
his
bar
where
he
was
engaged
in
the
usual
occupation
of
drinking
with
customers
for
the
of
the
house
a
map
of
the
county
of
such
liberal
dimensions
was
speedily
produced
as
would
have
terrified
any
one
unaccustomed
to
distances
and
scales
on
which
maps
are
laid
down
for
instance
jawleyford
court
as
the
crow
flies
was
the
same
distance
from
the
at
dallington
burn
as
york
was
from
london
in
a
map
of
england
hanging
beside
it
a
goodish
way
said
sponge
getting
a
lighter
off
the
and
measuring
the
distances
jawleyford
court
to
billingsborough
rise
say
seven
miles
from
billingsborough
rise
to

which
seems
the
nearest
point
will
be

perhaps
nineteen
or
twenty
in
all
well
my
work
he
observed
scratching
his
head
least
my
hack
and
from
here
home
he
continued
measuring
away
as
he
spoke
be
twelve
or
thirteen
well
that
nothing
he
said
for
the

he
continued
again
applying
the

in
a
different
direction

be
say
eight
miles
from
hardington
to
bewley

and
there
i
should
say
he
might
sleep
that
would
leave
ten
or
twelve
miles
for
the
morning
nothing
for
a
hack
hunter
such
a
horse
as
that
and
one
that
done
nothing
for
i
do
know
how
long
altogether
sponge
determined
to
try
it
especially
considering
that
if
he
did
get
tuesday
there
would
be
nothing
till
thursday
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
keep
a
hack
hunter
standing
idle
accordingly
he
sought
leather
whom
he
found
busily
engaged
in
the
servants
apartment
with
a
cold
round
of
beef
and
a
foaming
flagon
of
ale
before
him
he
said
in
a
tone
of
authority
hunt
ride
the
horse
i
should
have
ridden
at
asked
leather
diving
his
fork
into
a
bottle
of
pickles
and
fishing
out
an
onion
replied
sponge
be
fifty
miles
from
here
cried
leather
rejoined
sponge
just
measured
the
distance
it
nothing
of
the
sort
far
do
you
make
it
then
asked
leather
tucking
in
the
beef
from
here
to
hardington
is
about
six
and
from
hardington
to
bewley
four
ten
in
all
replied
sponge
can
stay
at
bewley
all
night
and
then
it
is
but
a
few
miles
on
in
the
morning
whativer
am
i
to
do
for
clothin
asked
leather
adding
nothin
with
me
nothin
nouther
for
oss
nor
man
the
ostler
lend
you
what
you
want
replied
sponge
in
a
tone
of
determination
adding
can
make
shift
for
one
night
surely
night
surely
retorted
leather
d
think
an
oss
ca
be
ruined
in
one
night
humph
risk
it
said
sponge
i
wo
replied
leather
blowing
the
foam
from
the
tankard
and
taking
a
long
swig
at
the
ale
thinks
i
knows
my
duty
to
my
better
nor
that
continued
he
setting
it
down
not
see
his
waluable
stowed
away
in
pigsties
not
i
indeed
the
fact
was
leather
had
an
invitation
to
sup
with
the
servants
at
jawleyford
court
that
night
and
he
was
not
going
to
be
done
out
of
his
engagement
especially
as
sponge
only
allowed
him
two
shillings
a
day
for
expenses
wherever
he
was
illustration
leather
and
sponge
have
a
difference
of
opinion
you
a
cool
hand
anyhow
observed
sponge
quite
taken
by
surprise
or
not
cool
replied
leather
munching
away
do
my
duty
to
my
master
i
not
one
o
your
coatless
characterless
scamps
wot
about
ready
to
do
anything
they
bid
no
sir
no
he
continued
pronging
another
onion
have
some
regard
for
the
hinterest
o
my
master
i
do
my
duty
in
the
station
o
life
in
which
i
placed
and
wo
be
to
face
no
man
so
saying
leather
cut
himself
a
grand
circumference
of
beef
sponge
was
taken
aback
for
he
had
never
seen
a
conscientious
helper
before
and
did
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
such
articles
however
here
was
leather
assuming
a
virtue
whether
he
had
it
or
not
and
sponge
being
in
the
man
power
of
course
durst
not
quarrel
with
him
it
was
clear
that
leather
would
not
go
and
the
question
was
what
should
sponge
do
should
i
go
myself
he
thought
shutting
his
eyes
as
if
to
keep
his
faculties
free
from
outward
distraction
he
ran
the
thing
quickly
over
in
his
mind
leather
can
do
i
can
do
he
said
remembering
that
a
groom
never
demeaned
himself
by
working
where
there
was
an
ostler
things
i
have
on
will
do
quite
well
for
at
least
among
such
dogs
as
the
flat
hat
men
who
seem
as
if
they
had
their
clothes
pitched
on
with
a
fork
his
mind
was
quickly
made
up
and
calling
for
pen
ink
and
paper
he
wrote
a
hasty
note
to
jawleyford
explaining
why
he
would
not
cast
up
till
the
morrow
he
then
got
the
chestnut
out
of
the
stable
and
desiring
the
ostler
to
give
the
note
to
leather
and
tell
him
to
go
home
with
his
hack
he
just
rode
out
of
the
yard
without
giving
leather
the
chance
of
saying
he
then
jogged
on
at
a
pace
suitable
to
the
accurate
measurement
of
the
distance
the
horse
seemed
to
like
having
sponge
red
coat
on
better
than
brown
and
champed
his
bit
and
stepped
away
quite
gaily
it
exclaimed
sponge
laying
the
rein
on
its
neck
and
leaning
forward
to
pat
him
a
pity
but
you
were
always
in
this
humour
be
worth
a
mint
of
money
if
you
were
he
then
resumed
his
seat
in
the
saddle
and
bethought
him
how
he
would
show
them
the
way
on
the
morrow
he
does
beat
every
horse
in
the
field
it
sha
be
my
fault
thought
he
and
thereupon
he
gave
him
the
slightest
possible
touch
with
the
spur
and
the
horse
shot
away
up
a
strip
of
grass
like
an
arrow
jove
but
you
go
said
he
pulling
up
as
the
grass
ran
out
upon
the
hard
road
thus
he
reached
the
village
of
hardington
which
he
quickly
cleared
and
took
the
road
to
bewley
a
road
adorned
with
milestones
and
set
out
with
a
liberal
at
either
side
day
had
closed
ere
our
friend
reached
bewley
but
the
children
returning
from
school
and
the
country
folks
leaving
their
work
kept
assuring
him
that
he
was
on
the
right
line
till
the
lights
of
the
town
bursting
upon
him
as
he
rounded
the
hill
above
showed
him
the
end
of
his
journey
the
best
stalls
at
the
head
inn
the
bull
head
were
all
full
several
trusty
grooms
having
arrived
with
the
usual
and
rolls
of
clothing
on
their
horses
denoting
the
object
of
their
mission
most
of
the
horses
had
been
in
some
hours
and
were
now
standing
well
littered
up
with
straw
while
the
grooms
were
in
the
tap
talking
over
their
masters
discussing
the
merits
of
their
horses
or
arguing
whether
lord
scamperdale
was
mad
or
not
they
had
just
come
to
the
conclusion
that
his
lordship
was
mad
but
not
incapable
of
taking
care
of
his
affairs
when
the
trampling
of
sponge
horse
feet
drew
them
out
to
see
who
was
coming
next
red
coat
at
once
told
his
tale
and
procured
him
the
usual
attention
leather
fear
of
the
want
of
clothing
for
the
valuable
hunter
proved
wholly
groundless
for
each
groom
having
come
with
a
plentiful
supply
for
his
own
horse
all
the
inn
stock
was
at
the
service
of
the
stranger
the
stable
to
be
sure
was
not
quite
so
good
as
might
be
desired
but
it
was
warm
and
and
the
corn
was
far
from
bad
altogether
sponge
thought
he
would
do
very
well
and
having
seen
to
his
horse
proceeded
to
choose
between
and
mutton
chops
for
his
own
entertainment
and
with
the
aid
of
the
old
country
paper
and
some
very
questionable
port
he
passed
the
evening
in
anticipation
of
the
sports
of
the
morrow
chapter
xxix
the
at
dallington
burn
illustration
when
his
lordship
and
jack
mounted
their
hacks
in
the
morning
to
go
to
the
at
dallington
burn
it
was
so
dark
that
they
could
not
see
whether
they
were
on
bays
or
browns
it
was
a
dull
murky
day
with
heavy
spongy
clouds
overhead
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
rain
in
the
night
and
the
horses
poached
and
squashed
as
they
went
our
sportsmen
however
were
prepared
as
well
for
what
had
fallen
as
for
what
might
come
for
they
were
encased
in
enormously
thick
boots
with
baggy
overalls
and
coats
and
waistcoats
of
the
stoutest
and
most
abundant
order
they
had
each
a
sack
of
a
mackintosh
strapped
on
to
their
saddle
fronts
thus
they
went
blobbing
and
groping
their
way
along
varying
the
monotony
of
the
journey
by
an
occasional
spurt
of
muddy
water
up
into
their
faces
or
the
more
noise
of
a
floundering
stumble
over
a
heap
of
stones
by
the
roadside
the
country
people
stared
with
astonishment
as
they
passed
and
the
muggers
and
tinkers
who
were
withdrawing
their
horses
from
the
farmers
fields
stood
trembling
lest
they
might
be
the
coming
after
them
think
it
be
a
fine
day
observed
his
lordship
after
they
had
bumped
for
some
time
in
silence
without
its
getting
much
lighter
think
it
will
be
a
fine
day
he
said
taking
his
chin
out
of
his
great
neckcloth
and
turning
his
spectacled
face
up
to
the
clouds
want
of
light
is
its
chief
fault
observed
jack
adding
deuced
dark
it
get
better
of
that
observed
his
lordship
not
much
after
eight
yet
he
added
staring
at
his
watch
and
with
difficulty
making
out
that
it
was
take
off
terribly
about
this
time
of
year
he
observed
seen
about
christmas
when
it
has
never
been
rightly
light
all
day
long
they
then
floundered
on
again
for
some
time
further
as
before
wonder
if
we
have
a
large
field
at
length
observed
jack
bringing
his
hack
alongside
his
lordship
wonder
if
puff
himself
was
to
come
all
over
brooches
and
rings
as
usual
replied
his
lordship
charley
slapp
i
be
bund
to
say
observed
jack
a
regular
of
puff
that
slapp
said
his
lordship
the
sight
of
him
do
i
replied
jack
adding
a
are
the
hounds
said
his
lordship
as
they
now
approached
culverton
dean
and
a
line
of
something
white
was
discernible
travelling
the
road
on
the
opposite
side
they
think
you
replied
jack
staring
through
his
great
spectacles
they
think
you
it
looks
to
me
more
like
a
flock
of
sheep
believe
you
right
said
his
lordship
staring
too
i
hear
the
dog
the
hounds
however
ca
be
far
ahead
they
then
drew
into
single
file
to
take
the
broken
through
the
steep
woody
dean
is
the
longest
sixteen
miles
i
know
observed
jack
as
they
emerged
from
it
and
overtook
the
sheep
is
replied
his
lordship
spurring
his
hack
who
was
now
beginning
to
lag
fact
is
it
eighteen
he
continued
if
i
was
to
tell
frosty
it
was
eighteen
he
would
want
to
lay
overnight
and
that
do
besides
the
trouble
and
inconvenience
it
would
spoil
the
best
part
of
a
note
and
notes
do
grow
upon
at
least
not
in
my
garden
scarce
in
all
gardens
just
now
i
think
observed
jack
least
i
never
hear
of
anybody
with
one
to
spare
like
snow
said
his
lordship
very
meltable
article
and
talking
of
snow
he
said
looking
up
at
the
heavy
clouds
wish
we
may
be
going
to
have
some
i
do
like
the
look
of
things
overhead
replied
jack
however
it
due
about
now
or
not
due
said
his
lordship
a
thing
one
never
wishes
to
come
anybody
may
have
my
share
of
snow
that
likes
frost
too
the
road
or
rather
track
now
passed
over
blobbington
moor
and
our
friends
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
their
horses
out
of
and
bogs
without
indulging
in
conversation
at
length
they
cleared
the
moor
and
pulling
out
a
gap
at
the
corner
of
the
inclosures
cut
across
a
few
fields
and
got
on
to
the
stumpington
turnpike
hounds
are
here
said
jack
after
studying
the
muddy
road
for
some
time
not
be
there
long
replied
his
lordship
grabtintoll
gate
is
far
ahead
and
we
do
waste
our
substance
on
pikes
his
lordship
was
right
the
imprints
soon
diverged
up
a
muddy
lane
on
the
right
and
our
sportsmen
now
got
into
a
road
so
deep
and
bottomless
as
to
put
the
idea
of
stones
quite
out
of
the
question
the
road
exclaimed
his
lordship
as
his
hack
nearly
came
on
his
nose
the
road
repeated
he
adding
puff
was
such
an
ass
i
really
think
i
give
him
up
the
country
bad
to
get
at
from
us
observed
jack
who
did
like
such
trashing
distances
but
it
a
rare
good
country
when
you
get
to
it
replied
his
lordship
shortening
his
rein
and
spurring
his
steed
the
lane
being
at
length
cleared
the
road
became
more
practicable
passing
over
large
pastures
where
a
horseman
could
choose
his
own
ground
instead
of
being
bound
by
the
narrow
limits
of
the
law
but
though
the
road
improved
the
day
did
not
a
thick
fog
coming
drifting
up
from
the
in
aid
of
the
general
obscurity
of
the
scene
day
gettin
observed
jack
snuffling
and
staring
about
blow
over
replied
his
lordship
who
was
not
easily
disheartened
blow
over
repeated
he
adding
rare
scents
such
days
as
these
but
we
must
put
on
continued
he
looking
at
his
watch
and
we
are
a
mile
or
more
off
yet
so
saying
he
clapped
spurs
to
his
hack
and
shot
away
at
a
canter
followed
by
jack
at
a
and
pincers
trot
a
hunt
is
something
like
an
assize
circuit
where
certain
great
guns
show
everywhere
and
smaller
men
drop
in
here
and
there
snatching
a
day
or
a
brief
as
the
case
may
be
sergeant
bluff
and
sergeant
huff
rustle
and
wrangle
in
every
court
while
meeke
and
sneeke
enjoy
their
frights
on
the
forensic
arenas
of
their
respective
towns
on
behalf
of
simple
neighbours
who
look
upon
them
as
thorough
solomons
so
with
hunts
certain
men
who
seem
to
have
been
sent
into
the
world
for
the
express
purpose
of
hunting
arrive
at
every
meet
far
and
near
with
a
punctuality
that
is
truly
surprising
and
rarely
associated
with
pleasure
if
you
listen
to
their
conversation
it
is
generally
a
dissertation
on
the
previous
day
sport
with
inquiries
as
to
the
nearest
way
to
cover
the
next
sometimes
it
is
seasoned
with
censure
of
some
other
pack
they
have
been
seeing
these
men
are
mounted
and
appointed
in
a
manner
that
shows
what
a
perfect
profession
hunting
is
with
them
of
course
they
come
cantering
to
cover
lest
any
one
should
suppose
they
ride
their
horses
on
the
was
like
two
hunts
or
two
circuits
joining
for
it
generally
drew
the
picked
men
from
each
to
say
nothing
of
outriggers
and
chance
customers
the
regular
attendants
of
either
hunt
were
sufficiently
distinguishable
as
well
by
the
flat
hats
and
baggy
garments
of
the
one
as
by
the
dandified
jemmy
jessamy
air
of
the
other
if
a
lord
had
not
been
at
the
head
of
the
flat
hats
the
puffington
men
would
have
considered
them
insufferable
snobs
but
to
our
day
as
usual
where
hounds
have
to
travel
a
long
distance
the
field
were
assembled
before
they
arrived
almost
all
the
cantering
gentlemen
had
cast
up
one
meet
being
so
much
like
another
it
will
not
be
worth
while
describing
the
one
at
dallington
burn
the
reader
will
have
the
kindness
to
imagine
a
couple
of
roads
crossing
an
open
common
with
an
armless
on
one
side
and
a
bridge
with
several
of

a

a

its

with

unwonted

trotting
up
to
them
and
throwing
himself
off
his

like
a

having
divested
himself
of
his
muddy
overalls
he
mounted
the
brown
a
splendid
horse
in

and
again
made
for
the
field
in
all
the
pride
of
masterly
equestrianism
a
momentary
gleam
of

shot
the

a

a
large

formed
partly
of

partly
of

with

there
a
sprinkling
of

his
lordship
paid
two
pounds
a
year
for
it
having
vainly
tried
to
get
it
for
thirty
shillings
which
was
about
the
actual
value
of
the
land
but
the
proprietor
claimed
a
little
compensation
for
the
trampling
of
horses
about
it
moreover
the
puffington
men
would
have
taken
it
at
two
pounds
it
was
a
sure
find
and
the
hounds
dashed
into
it

in
a
medley

a

caused
all
tongues
to
stop
and
all

to

as

with
the
eager

rushing
at

then
as
the
hounds
crossed
the
line
of

there
was
such
an
outburst
of
melody
in
cover
and
such
gathering
of
reins
and
thrusting
on
of
hats
outside
the
hounds
dashed
out
of

as
if
somebody
was
kicking
them

in

again
having
arrived
late
he
had
posted
himself
unseen
by
the
cover
side
and
the
fox
had
broke
close
to
him
unfortunately
he
had
headed
him
back
and
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
was
the
result
not
only
had
he
headed
him
back
but
the
resolute
chestnut
having
taken
it
into
his
head
to
run
away
had
snatched
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
carried
him
to
the
far
side
of
a
field
ere
sponge
managed
to
manoere
him
round
on
a
very
liberal
and
face
the
now
flying
sportsmen
who
came
hurrying
on
through
the
mist
like
a
charge
of
yeomanry
after
a
salute
all
was
excitement
and
with
the
usual
spurring
elbowing
and
exertion
to
get

had

much
right

apparently
being
all
the

to
the
chestnut
which
way
he
went
so
long
as
he
had
his
run
he
now
bore
sponge
back
as
quickly
as
he
had
carried
him
away
and
with
yawning
mouth
and
head
in
the
air
he
dashed
right
at
the
coming
horsemen
charging
lord
scamperdale
full
tilt
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
returning
his
horn

a

in

he
was
scattered
all
over
in

instant
he
lay
the
centre
of
a
circle
kicking
on
his
back
like
a

roared

out

bolting
the
badger
when
a
man
and
his
horse
differ
seriously
in
public
and
the
man
feels
the
horse
has
the
best
of
it
it
is
wise
for
the
man
to
appear
to
accommodate
his
views
to
those
of
the
horse
rather
than
risk
a
defeat
it
is
best
to
let
the
horse
go
his
way
and
pretend
it
is
yours
there
is
no
secret
so
close
as
that
between
a
rider
and
his
horse
sponge
having
scattered
lord
scamperdale
in
the
summary
way
described
in
our
last
chapter
let
the
chestnut
gallop
away
consoling
himself
with
the
idea
that
even
if
the
hounds
did
hunt
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
show
his
horse
to
advantage
on
so
dark
and
unfavourable
a
day
he
therefore
just
let
the
beast
gallop
till
he
began
to
flag
and
then
he
spurred
him
and
made
him
gallop
on
his
account
he
thus
took
his
change
out
of
him
and
arrived
at
jawleyford
court
a
little
after
luncheon
time
brief
as
had
been
his
absence
things
had
undergone
a
great
change
certain
dark
hints
respecting
his
ways
and
means
had
worked
their
way
from
the
servants
hall
to
my
lady
chamber
and
into
the
upper
regions
generally
these
had
been
augmented
by
leather
the
trusty
groom
overnight
visit
in
fulfilment
of
his
engagement
to
sup
with
the
servants
nor
was
leather
anger
abated
by
the
unceremonious
way
sponge
rode
off
with
the
horse
leaving
him
to
hear
of
his
departure
from
the
ostler
having
broken
faith
with
him
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
be
with
him
and
tell
the
servants
all
he
knew
about
him
accordingly
he
let
out
in
strict
confidence
of
course
to
spigot
that
so
far
from
sponge
being
a
gentleman
of
as
he
called
it
with
a
dozen
or
two
hunters
planted
here
and
there
he
was
nothing
but
the
hirer
of
a
couple
of
hacks
with
himself
as
a
by
the
week
spigot
who
was
on
the
best
of
terms
with
the
and
had
his
clothes
washed
on
the
sly
in
the
laundry
could
not
do
less
than
communicate
the
intelligence
to
her
from
whom
it
went
to
the
and
thence
circulated
in
the
upper
regions

the
maid
finding
miss
amelia
less
indisposed
to
hear
sponge
run
down
than
she
expected
proceeded
to
add
her
own
observations
to
the
information
derived
from
leather
the
groom
she
could
say
that
she
thought
much
of
sponge
herself
his
shirts
were
coarse
so
were
his
and
she
never
yet
saw
a
real
gent
without
a
valet
amelia
without
any
positive
intention
of
giving
up
sponge
at
least
not
until
she
saw
further
had
nevertheless
got
an
idea
that
she
was
destined
for
a
much
higher
sphere
having
duly
considered
all
the
circumstances
of
spraggon
visit
to
jawleyford
court
conned
over
several
mysterious
coughs
and
sentences
he
had
indulged
in
she
had
about
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
real
object
of
his
mission
was
to
negotiate
a
matrimonial
alliance
on
behalf
of
lord
scamperdale
his
lordship
constantly
expressed
intention
of
getting
married
was
well
calculated
to
mislead
one
whose
experience
of
the
world
was
not
sufficiently
great
to
know
that
those
men
who
are
always
talking
about
it
are
the
least
likely
to
get
married
just
as
men
who
are
always
talking
about
buying
horses
are
the
men
who
never
do
buy
them
be
that
however
as
it
may
amelia
was
tolerably
easy
about
sponge
if
he
had
money
she
could
take
him
if
he
had
she
could
let
him
alone
jawleyford
too
who
was
more
hospitable
at
a
distance
and
in
imagination
than
in
reality
had
had
about
enough
of
our
friend
indeed
a
man
whose
talk
was
of
hunting
and
his
reading
was
not
likely
to
have
much
in
common
with
a
gentleman
of
taste
and
elegance
as
our
friend
set
up
to
be
the
delicate
inquiry
that
jawleyford
now
made
as
to
he
knew
sponge
to
be
a
man
of
fortune
set
him
off
at
a
tangent
know
he
a
man
of
fortune
know
nothing
of
his
fortune
you
asked
him
here
not
me
exclaimed
jawleyford
stamping
furiously
my
dear
replied
jawleyford
mildly
asked
himself
you
know
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
said
something
that
say
anything
interrupted
jawleyford
never
said
anything
at
least
nothing
that
any
man
with
a
particle
of
sense
would
think
anything
of
continued
he
remembering
the
scene
in
the
one
thing
to
tell
a
man
if
he
comes
your
way
be
glad
to
see
him
and
another
to
ask
him
to
come
bag
and
baggage
as
this
impudent
sponge
has
done
added
he
replied
jawleyford
who
saw
where
the
shoe
was
pinching
her
bear
wish
he
was
off
observed
jawleyford
after
a
pause
bothers
me
excessively
i
try
and
get
rid
of
him
by
saying
we
are
going
from
home
can
you
say
we
are
going
to
asked
jawleyford
anywhere
replied
jawleyford
does
know
the
people
about
here
the
tewkesbury
the
woolerton
the
brown
anybody
before
they
had
got
any
definite
plan
of
proceeding
arranged
sponge
returned
from
the
chase
my
dear
sir
exclaimed
jawleyford
extending
a
couple
of
fingers
as
sponge
entered
his
study
thought
you
had
taken
french
leave
of
us
and
were
off
sponge
asked
if
his
groom
had
not
delivered
his
note
replied
jawleyford
boldly
though
he
had
it
in
his
pocket
least
not
that
i
seen
jawleyford
perhaps
may
have
got
it
added
he
exclaimed
sponge
was
very
idle
of
him
he
then
proceeded
to
detail
to
jawleyford
what
the
reader
already
knows
how
he
had
lost
his
day
at
larkhall
hill
and
had
tried
to
make
up
for
it
by
going
to
the
exclaimed
jawleyford
when
he
was
done
a
pity
great
pity
monstrous
pity
never
knew
anything
so
unlucky
in
my
life
will
happen
replied
sponge
in
a
tone
of
unconcern
it
was
so
much
the
loss
of
the
hunt
i
was
thinking
of
replied
jawleyford
the
arrangements
we
have
made
in
consequence
of
thinking
you
were
gone
are
they
asked
sponge
my
lord
barker
a
great
friend
of
ours
known
him
from
a
boy
just
like
brothers
in
short
sent
over
this
morning
to
ask
us
all
there
shooting
party
charades
that
sort
of
thing
and
we
accepted
that
need
make
no
difference
replied
sponge
go
too
jawleyford
was
taken
aback
he
had
not
calculated
upon
so
much
coolness
stammered
he
might
do
to
be
sure
but
if
i
not
quite
sure
that
i
could
take
any
one
if
you
as
thick
as
you
say
you
can
have
no
difficulty
replied
our
friend
replied
jawleyford
then
we
go
a
large
party
ourselves
two
and
two
four
said
he
say
nothing
of
servants
besides
his
lordship
may
have
room
house
will
most
likely
be
full
a
single
man
can
always
be
put
up
anything
does
for
him
replied
sponge
you
would
lose
your
hunting
replied
jawleyford
tower
is
quite
out
of
lord
scamperdale
country
does
matter
replied
sponge
adding
do
think
i
trouble
his
lordship
much
more
these
flat
hat
gentlemen
are
not
over
and
above
civil
in
my
opinion
replied
jawleyford
nettled
at
this
thwarting
of
his
attempt
for
your
consideration
however
as
you
come
i
talk
to
jawleyford
and
see
if
we
can
get
off
the
barkington
expedition
do
get
off
on
my
account
replied
sponge
can
stay
here
quite
well
i
dare
say
you
not
be
away
long
this
was
worse
still
it
held
out
no
hope
of
getting
rid
of
him
jawleyford
therefore
resolved
to
try
and
smoke
and
starve
him
out
when
our
friend
went
to
dress
he
found
his
old
apartment
the
put
away
the
heavy
brocade
curtains
the
jugs
turned
upside
down
the
bed
stripped
of
its
clothes
and
the
laid
of
it
the
smirking
housemaid
who
was
just
rolling
the
up
in
the
greeted
him
with
a
sir
we
shifted
you
into
the
brown
room
east
leading
the
way
to
the
condemned
cell
that
had
occupied
where
a
newly
lit
fire
was
puffing
out
dense
clouds
of
brown
smoke
obscuring
even
the
gilt
letters
on
the
back
of
cab
as
the
little
volume
lay
on
the
happened
now
asked
our
friend
of
the
maid
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
giving
her
a
hearty
squeeze
happened
now
that
you
put
me
into
this
asked
he
i
do
know
replied
she
laughing
they
afraid
bring
the
old
rotten
curtains
down
in
the
other
room
with
smokin
a
sad
old
wife
added
she
a
great
change
had
come
over
everything
the
fare
the
lights
the
footmen
the
everything
underwent
grievous
diminution
the
lamps
were
extinguished
and
the
transparent
wax
gave
way
to
palmer
composites
under
the
mild
influence
of
whose
unsearching
light
the
young
ladies
sported
their
dashed
dresses
with
impunity
competition
between
them
indeed
was
about
an
end
amelia
claimed
sponge
should
he
be
worth
having
and
should
the
scamperdale
scheme
fail
while
emily
having
her
mamma
assurance
that
he
would
not
do
for
either
of
them
resigned
herself
complacently
to
what
she
could
not
help
illustration
sponge
demanding
an
explanation
sponge
on
his
part
saw
that
all
things
portended
a
close
he
cared
nothing
about
the
old
set
usurping
the
place
of
the
china
but
the
contents
of
the
dishes
were
bad
and
the
wine
if
possible
worse
most
palpable
marsala
did
duty
for
sherry
and
the
corked
port
was
again
in
requisition
jawleyford
was
no
longer
the
brisk
jawleyford
of
laverick
wells
but
a
crusty
fidgety
sort
of
fellow
desperately
given
to
his
worst
of
all
when
sponge
retired
to
his
den
to
smoke
a
cigar
and
study
his
dear
cab
fares
he
was
so
suffocated
with
smoke
that
he
was
obliged
to
put
out
the
fire
notwithstanding
the
weather
was
cold
indeed
inclining
to
frost
he
lit
his
cigar
notwithstanding
and
as
he
indulged
in
it
he
ran
all
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
through
his
mind
his
pressing
invitation
his
magnificent
reception
the
attention
of
the
ladies
and
now
the
sudden
change
everything
had
taken
he
could
make
it
out
somehow
but
the
consequences
were
plain
enough
fellow
a
humbug
at
length
said
he
throwing
the
away
and
turning
into
bed
when
the
information
watson
the
keeper
gave
him
on
arriving
recurred
to
his
mind
and
he
was
satisfied
that
jawleyford
was
a
humbug
it
was
clear
sponge
had
made
a
mistake
in
coming
the
best
thing
he
could
do
now
was
to
back
out
and
see
if
the
fair
amelia
would
take
it
to
heart
in
the
midst
of
his
cogitations
puffington
pressing
invitation
occurred
to
his
mind
and
it
appeared
to
be
the
very
thing
for
him
affording
him
an
immediate
asylum
within
reach
of
the
fair
lady
should
she
be
likely
to
die
next
day
he
wrote
to
volunteer
a
visit
puffington
who
was
still
in
ignorance
of
our
friend
real
character
and
still
believed
him
to
be
a
second
out
on
a
was
overjoyed
at
his
letter
and
strange
to
relate
the
same
post
that
brought
his
answer
jumping
at
the
proposal
brought
a
letter
from
lord
scamperdale
to
jawleyford
saying
that
soon
as
jawleyford
was
scored
under
he
would
like
to
pay
him
a
visit
his
lordship
we
should
inform
the
reader
notwithstanding
his
recent
mishap
still
held
out
against
jack
spraggon
recommendation
to
get
rid
of
sponge
by
buying
his
horses
and
he
determined
to
try
this
experiment
first
his
lordship
thought
at
one
time
of
entering
into
an
explanation
telling
jawleyford
the
damage
sponge
had
done
him
and
the
nuisance
he
was
entailing
upon
him
by
harbouring
him
but
not
being
a
great
scholar
and
several
hard
words
turning
up
that
his
lordship
could
not
well
clear
in
the
spelling
he
just
confined
himself
to
a
laconic
which
as
it
turned
out
was
a
most
fortunate
course
indeed
he
had
another
difficulty
besides
the
spelling
for
the
hounds
having
as
usual
had
a
great
run
after
sponge
had
floored
him
knocked
his
right
eye
into
the
heel
of
his
left
boot
as
he
said
in
the
course
of
which
run
his
lordship
horse
had
rolled
over
him
on
a
road
he
was
like
the
railway
people
unable
to
distinguish
between
capital
and
income
unable
to
say
which
were
sponge
bangs
and
which
his
own
so
like
a
hard
sort
of
a
man
as
he
was
he
just
pocketed
all
and
wrote
as
we
have
described
his
lordship
and
puffington
letters
diffused
joy
into
a
house
that
seemed
likely
to
be
distracted
with
trouble
so
then
endeth
our
thirtieth
chapter
and
a
very
pleasant
ending
it
is
for
we
leave
everyone
in
perfect
good
humour
and
spirits
sponge
pleased
at
having
got
a
fresh
billet
jawleyford
delighted
at
the
coming
of
the
lord
and
each
fair
lady
practising
in
private
how
to
sign
her
christian
name
in
conjunction
with
chapter
xxxi
puffington
or
the
young
man
about
town
puffington
took
the
mangeysterne
now
the
hanby
hounds
because
he
thought
they
would
give
him
consequence
not
that
he
was
particularly
deficient
in
that
article
but
being
a
new
man
in
the
county
he
thought
that
taking
them
would
make
him
popular
and
give
him
standing
he
had
no
natural
inclination
for
hunting
but
seeing
friends
who
had
no
taste
for
the
turf
take
upon
themselves
the
responsibility
of
stewardships
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
make
a
similar
sacrifice
at
the
shrine
of
diana
indeed
puff
was
not
bred
for
a
sportsman
his
father
a
most
estimable
man
and
one
with
whom
we
have
spent
many
a
convivial
evening
was
a
great
at
stepney
and
his
mother
was
the
daughter
of
an
eminent
worcestershire
maker
save
such
ludicrous
hunts
as
they
might
have
seen
on
their
brown
jugs
we
do
not
believe
either
of
them
had
any
acquaintance
whatever
with
the
chase
old
puffington
was
however
what
a
wise
heir
esteems
a
great
deal
more
an
excellent
man
of
business
and
amassed
mountains
of
money
to
see
his
establishment
at
stepney
one
would
think
the
whole
world
was
going
to
be
starched
enormous
emerged
with
ponderous
waggons
heaped
up
to
the
very
skies
while
others
would
come
rumbling
in
laden
with
wheat
potatoes
and
other
ingredients
puffington
blue
roans
were
well
known
about
town
and
were
considered
the
handsomest
horses
of
the
day
quite
equal
to
barclay
and
perkin
piebalds
old
puffington
was
not
like
a
sportsman
he
was
a
little
soft
rosy
roundabout
man
with
stiff
resolute
legs
that
did
not
look
as
if
they
could
be
bent
to
a
saddle
he
was
great
however
in
a
gig
and
slouched
like
a
sack
puffington
smith
was
a
tall
handsome
woman
who
thought
a
good
deal
of
herself
when
she
and
her
spouse
married
they
lived
close
to
the
manufactory
in
a
sweet
little
villa
replete
with
every
elegance
and
convenience
a
pond
which
they
called
a
lake
laburnums
without
end
a
yew
clipped
into
a
standing
for
three
horses
and
gigs
with
an
acre
and
half
of
land
for
a
cow
old
puffington
however
being
unable
to
keep
those
dearest
documents
of
the
british
merchant
his
to
himself
and
puffington
finding
a
considerable
sum
going
to
the
every
year
insisted
on
the
birth
of
their
only
child
our
friend
upon
migrating
to
the
as
she
called
it
and
at
one
bold
stroke
they
established
themselves
in
heathcote
street
mecklenburgh
square
novelists
had
not
then
written
this
part
down
as
and
it
was
quite
as
genteel
as
harley
or
wimpole
street
are
now
their
chief
object
then
was
to
increase
their
wealth
and
make
their
only
son
gentleman
they
sent
him
to
eton
and
in
due
time
to
christ
church
where
of
course
he
established
a
red
coat
to
persecute
sir
thomas
mostyn
and
the
duke
of
beaufort
hounds
much
to
the
annoyance
of
their
respective
huntsmen
stephen
goodall
and
philip
payne
and
the
aggravation
of
poor
old
griff
lloyd
what
between
the
field
and
college
young
puffington
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
very
dashing
young
sparks
lord
firebrand
lord
mudlark
lord
deuceace
sir
harry
blueun
and
others
whom
he
always
spoke
of
as
in
the
easy
style
that
marks
the
perfect
gentleman
how
proud
the
old
people
were
of
him
how
they
would
sit
listening
to
him
flashing
and
telling
how
deuceace
and
he
floored
a
charley
or
blueun
and
he
pitched
a
snob
out
of
the
boxes
into
the
pit
this
was
in
the
old
days
when
fisticuffs
were
the
fashion
one
evening
after
he
had
indulged
us
with
a
more
than
usual
dose
and
was
leaving
the
room
to
dress
for
an
eight
dinner
at
long
exclaimed
the
old
man
clutching
our
arm
as
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
that
an
instance
of
a
man
and
certainly
if
a
large
acquaintance
is
a
criterion
of
popularity
young
puffington
as
he
was
then
called
had
his
fair
share
he
once
did
us
the
honour
an
honour
we
shall
never
forget
of
walking
down
bond
street
with
us
in
the
of
fashion
of
a
glorious
summer
day
when
you
could
not
cross
conduit
street
under
a
lapse
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
carriages
seemed
to
have
come
to
an
interminable
lock
at
the
piccadilly
end
of
the
street
in
those
days
great
people
went
about
like
great
people
in
handsome
coaches
with
plethoric
coachmen
and
gigantic
johnnies
instead
of
rumbling
along
like
apothecaries
in
with
a
handle
inside
to
let
themselves
out
young
men
too
dressed
as
if
they
were
dressed
as
if
they
were
got
up
with
some
care
and
attention
instead
of
wearing
the
loose
careless
flowing
garments
they
do
now
we
remember
the
day
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
puffington
overtook
us
in
oxford
street
where
we
were
taking
our
usual
sauntering
stare
into
the
shop
windows
and
instead
of
shirking
or
slipping
behind
our
back
he
actually
ran
his
arm
up
to
the
hilt
in
ours
and
turned
us
into
the
middle
of
the
flags
with
an
buzzer
old
boy
what
are
you
doing
in
this
debauched
part
of
the
town
come
along
with
me
and
i
show
you
life
so
saying
he
linked
arms
and
pursuing
our
course
at
a
proper
sort
of
pace
we
were
at
length
brought
up
at
the
end
of
vere
street
along
which
there
was
a
regular
rush
of
carriages
cutting
away
as
if
they
were
going
to
a
fire
instead
of
to
a
finery
shop
many
were
the
smiles
and
bows
and
nods
and
finger
kisses
and
bright
eyes
and
sweet
glances
that
the
fair
flyers
shot
at
our
friend
as
they
darted
past
we
were
lost
in
astonishment
at
the
sight
said
we
the
old
man
was
right
this
an
instance
of
a
man
young
puffington
was
then
in
the
heyday
of
youth
about
or
so
slim
and
standing
with
the
aid
of
boots
little
under
six
feet
high
he
had
taken
after
his
mother
not
after
old
tom
trodgers
as
they
called
his
papa
at
length
we
crossed
over
oxford
street
and
taking
the
shady
side
of
bond
street
were
quickly
among
the
real
swells
of
the
world
men
who
crawled
along
as
if
life
was
a
perfect
burden
to
them
men
with
fixed
and
tasselled
canes
in
their
hands
scarcely
less
ponderous
than
those
borne
by
the
footmen
great
heavens
but
they
were
tight
and
smart
and
shiny
and
puffington
was
just
as
tight
and
smart
and
shiny
as
any
of
them
he
was
as
much
in
his
element
here
as
he
appeared
to
be
out
of
it
in
oxford
street
it
might
be
prejudice
or
want
of
penetration
on
our
part
but
we
thought
he
looked
as
as
any
of
them
they
all
seemed
to
know
each
other
and
the
nodding
and
winking
and
jerking
began
as
soon
as
we
got
across
puff
kindly
acted
as
cicerone
or
we
should
not
have
been
aware
of
the
consequence
we
were
encountering
jemmy
exclaimed
a
youth
to
our
friend
are
you
breakfasted
yet
to
replied
puffington
whom
they
called
jemmy
because
his
name
was
tommy
said
he
in
an
undertone
a
fellow
lord
legbail
eldest
son
of
the
marquis
of
loosefish
will
be
lord
loosefish
we
were
at
the
finish
together
till
six
this
morning
such
fun
bonneted
a
charley
stole
his
rattle
and
broke
an
early
stall
all
to
shivers
just
then
up
came
a
hat
above
a
confused
mass
of
greatcoats
and
coloured
shawls
jack
exclaimed
puffington
laying
hold
of
a
button
nearly
as
large
as
a
off
yet
going
replied
jack
with
a
touch
of
his
hat
as
he
rolled
on
adding
aught
down
the
road
coachman
is
that
asked
we
replied
puff
with
a
snort
jack
linchpin
honourable
jack
linchpin
son
of
lord
splinterbars
best
gentleman
coachman
in
england
so
puffington
sauntered
along
good
morninging
harrys
and
jameses
and
johns
and
toms
till
seeing
a
batch
of
irreproachable
dandies
flattening
their
noses
against
the
windows
of
the
sailors
old
club
in
whose
eyes
he
perhaps
thought
our
city
coat
and
country
gaiters
would
not
find
much
favour
he
gave
us
a
hasty
parting
squeeze
of
the
arm
and
bolted
into
long
just
as
a
mountainous
was
rumbling
between
us
and
them
but
to
the
old
man
time
rolled
on
and
at
length
old
puffington
paid
the
debt
of
nature
the
only
debt
by
the
way
that
he
was
slow
in
discharging
and
our
friend
found
himself
in
possession
not
only
of
the
starch
manufactory
but
of
a
very
great
accumulation
of
consols
so
great
that
though
starch
is
as
inoffensive
a
thing
as
a
man
can
well
deal
in
a
thing
that
never
obtrudes
itself
or
indeed
appears
in
a
shop
unless
it
is
asked
for
notwithstanding
all
this
and
though
it
was
bringing
him
in
lots
of
money
our
friend
determined
to
the
shop
and
be
done
with
trade
altogether
accordingly
he
sold
the
premises
and
with
all
the
stock
of
potatoes
and
wheat
to
the
foreman
old
soapsuds
at
something
below
what
they
were
really
worth
rather
than
make
any
row
in
the
way
of
advertising
and
the
name
of
brothers
reigns
on
the
where
formerly
that
of
puffington
stood
supreme
it
is
a
melancholy
fact
which
those
best
acquainted
with
london
society
can
vouch
for
that
her
are
a
very
ephemeral
race
take
the
last
years
say
from
the
days
of
the
golden
ball
and
hayne
down
to
those
of
molly
c
l
and
and
see
what
a
succession
of
joyous
no
not
joyous
but
rattling
careless
dashing
youths
we
have
had
and
where
are
they
all
now
some
dead
some
at
some
in
denman
lodge
some
perhaps
undergoing
the
polite
attentions
of
commissioner
phillips
or
figuring
in
hemp
periodical
publication
of
gentlemen
are
wanted
in
speaking
of
of
course
we
are
not
alluding
to
men
with
reference
to
their
clothes
alone
but
to
men
whose
dashing
and
perhaps
eccentric
exteriors
are
but
indicative
of
their
general
system
of
extravagance
the
man
who
rests
his
claims
to
distinction
solely
on
his
clothes
will
very
soon
find
himself
in
want
of
society
many
things
contribute
to
thin
the
ranks
of
our
swells
many
as
we
said
before
outrun
the
constable
some
get
fat
some
get
married
some
get
tired
and
a
few
get
wiser
there
is
however
always
a
fine
pushing
crop
coming
on
a
man
like
puffington
who
starts
a
dandy
in
contradistinction
to
a
swell
and
adheres
steadily
to
clothes
talking
eternally
of
the
cuts
of
coats
or
the
ties
of
cravats
up
to
the
sober
age
of
forty
must
be
always
falling
back
on
the
rising
generation
for
society
puffington
was
not
what
the
old
ladies
call
a
profligate
young
man
on
the
contrary
he
was
naturally
a
nice
steady
young
man
and
only
indulged
in
the
vagaries
we
have
described
because
they
were
indulged
in
by
the
and
gay
tom
and
jerry
had
a
great
deal
to
answer
for
in
the
way
of
leading
young
men
astray
and
old
puffington
having
had
the
misfortune
to
christen
our
friend
of
course
his
companions
dubbed
him
tom
by
which
name
he
has
been
known
ever
since
a
man
of
such
undoubted
wealth
could
not
be
otherwise
than
a
great
favourite
with
the
fair
and
innumerable
were
the
invitations
that
poured
into
his
chambers
in
the
albany
dinner
parties
evening
parties
balls
concerts
boxes
for
the
opera
and
as
each
succeeding
season
drew
to
a
close
invitations
to
those
last
efforts
of
the
desperate
boating
and
whitebait
parties
corinthian
tom
went
to
them
all
at
least
to
as
many
as
he
could
manage
always
dressing
in
the
most
exemplary
way
as
though
he
had
been
asked
to
show
his
fine
clothes
instead
of
to
make
love
to
the
ladies
manifold
were
the
hopes
and
expectations
that
he
raised
puff
could
not
understand
that
though
it
is
all
very
well
to
be
instance
of
a
man
with
the
men
that
the
same
sort
of
thing
does
not
do
with
the
ladies
we
have
heard
that
there
were
six
mammas
bowling
about
in
their
barouches
at
the
close
of
his
second
season
innuendoing
nodding
and
hinting
to
their
friends
when
there
was
one
of
their
daughters
who
had
penetrated
the
hide
of
his
own
conceit
the
consequence
was
that
all
these
ladies
all
their
daughters
all
the
relations
and
connexions
of
this
life
thought
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
our
friend
puff
proclaim
how
infamously
he
had
behaved
all
because
he
had
danced
three
supper
dances
with
one
girl
brought
another
a
fine
bouquet
from
covent
garden
walked
a
third
away
from
her
party
at
a
picnic
at
erith
begged
the
mamma
of
a
fourth
to
take
her
to
a
woolwich
ball
sent
a
fifth
a
ticket
for
a
toxophilite
meeting
and
dangled
about
the
carriage
of
the
sixth
at
a
review
at
the
scrubbs
poor
puff
never
thought
of
being
more
than
an
instance
of
a
man
not
that
the
ladies
denunciations
did
the
corinthian
any
harm
at
first
old
ladies
know
each
other
better
than
that
and
each
new
mamma
had
no
doubt
but
depecarde
or
mainchance
as
the
case
might
be
had
been
deceiving
herself
always
doing
so
indeed
her
ugly
girls
were
not
likely
to
attract
any
one
certainly
not
such
an
elegant
man
as
corinthian
tom
but
as
season
after
season
passed
away
and
the
corinthian
still
played
the
old
game
still
went
the
old
rounds
the
dinner
and
ball
invitations
gradually
dwindled
away
till
he
became
a
mere

the
one

a
appendage

the

the

now

puffington
fat
fair
and
rather
more
than
forty
puffington
no
longer
the
light
limber
lad
who
patronized
us
in
bond
street
but
puffington
a
plump
portly
sort
of
personage
filling
his
smart
clothes
uncommonly
full
men
no
longer
hailing
him
heartily
from
bay
windows
or
greeting
him
cheerily
in
short
but
familiar
terms
but
bowing
ceremoniously
as
they
passed
with
their
wives
or
perhaps
turning
down
streets
or
into
shops
to
avoid
him
what
is
the
last
rose
of
summer
to
do
under
such
circumstances
what
indeed
but
retire
into
the
country
a
man
may
shine
there
long
after
he
is
voted
a
bore
in
town
provided
none
of
his
old
friends
are
there
to
proclaim
him
country
people
are
tolerant
of
twaddle
and
slow
of
finding
things
out
for
themselves
puff
now
turned
his
attention
to
the
country
or
rather
to
the
advertisements
of
estates
for
sale
and
immortal
george
robins
soon
fitted
him
with
one
of
his
earthly
paradises
a
mansion
replete
with
every
modern
elegance
luxury
and
convenience
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
most
lovely
scenery
in
the
world
with
eight
hundred
acres
of
land
of
the
finest
quality
capable
of
growing
forty
bushels
of
wheat
after
turnips
in
addition
to
the
estate
there
was
a
lordship
or
reputed
lordship
to
shoot
over
a
river
to
fish
in
a
pack
of
to
hunt
with
and
the
advertisements
gave
a
sly
hint
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
property
influencing
the
representation
of
the
neighbouring
borough
of
swillingford
if
not
of
returning
the
member
itself
this
was
hanby
house
and
though
the
description
undoubtedly
partook
of
george
usual
style
the
manor
being
only
a
manor
provided
the
owner
sacrificed
his
interest
in
swillingford
by
driving
off
its
poachers
and
the
river
being
only
a
river
when
the
tiny
swill
was
swollen
into
one
still
hanby
house
was
a
very
nice
attractive
sort
of
place
and
seen
in
the
rich
foliage
of
its
summer
dress
with
all
its
roses
and
flowering
shrubs
in
full
blow
the
description
was
not
so
wide
of
the
mark
as
robins
descriptions
usually
were
puff
bought
it
and
became
what
he
called
man
of
to
be
sure
after
he
got
possession
he
found
that
it
was
only
an
acre
here
and
there
that
would
grow
forty
bushels
of
wheat
after
turnips
and
that
there
was
a
good
deal
more
to
do
at
the
house
than
he
expected
the
furniture
of
the
late
occupants
having
hidden
many
defects
added
to
which
they
had
walked
off
with
almost
everything
they
could
wrench
down
under
the
name
of
fixtures
indeed
there
was
not
a
peg
to
hang
up
his
hat
when
he
entered
this
however
was
nothing
and
puff
very
soon
made
it
into
one
of
the
most
perfect
bachelor
residences
that
ever
was
seen
not
but
that
it
was
a
family
house
with
good
nurseries
and
offices
of
every
description
but
puff
used
to
take
a
sort
of
wicked
pleasure
in
telling
the
ladies
who
came
trooping
over
with
their
daughters
pretending
they
thought
he
was
from
home
and
wishing
to
see
the
elegant
furniture
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
nurseries
which
he
was
going
to
convert
into
billiard
and
this
and
a
few
similar
sallies
earned
our
friend
the
reputation
of
a
wit
in
the
country
there
was
great
rush
of
gentlemen
to
call
upon
him
many
of
the
mammas
seemed
to
think
that
first
come
would
be
first
served
and
sent
their
husbands
over
before
he
was
fairly
squatted
various
and
contradictory
were
the
accounts
they
brought
home
men
are
so
stupid
at
seeing
and
remembering
things
old
muddle
came
back
bemused
with
sherry
declaring
that
he
thought
puffington
was
as
old
as
he
was
while
mousetrap
thought
he
was
more
than
thirty
at
the
outside
she
described
him
as
handsome
slowan
could
tell
whether
the
furniture
was
chintz
or
damask
or
what
it
was
indeed
he
was
sure
that
he
was
in
the
at
all
while
gapes
insisted
that
the
carpet
was
a
turkey
carpet
whereas
it
was
a
royal
cut
pile
it
might
be
that
the
smartness
and
freshness
of
everything
confused
the
bucolic
minds
little
accustomed
to
wholesale
grandeur
puffington
quite
eclipsed
all
the
old
country
families
with
their
rooms
and
furniture
then
when
he
began
to
grind
about
the
country
in
his
lofty
with
a
pair
of
spanking
bays
and
a
couple
of
lolling
grooms
shedding
his
cards
in
return
for
their
calls
there
was
such
a
talk
such
a
commotion
as
had
never
been
known
before
then
indeed
he
was
appreciated
at
his
true
worth
illustration
an
man
puffington
was
here
the
other
day
said
smirk
to
mrs
smooth
in
the
style
such
a
charming
man
such
ease
such
manners
such
knowledge
of
high
life
puff
had
been
at
his
old
tricks
he
had
resuscitated
lord
legbail
now
earl
of
loosefish
imported
sir
harry
blueun
from
somewhere
near
geneva
whither
he
had
retired
on
marrying
his
mistress
and
resuscitated
lord
mudlark
who
had
broken
his
neck
many
years
before
from
his
tandem
in
piccadilly
whatever
was
said
puff
always
had
a
duplicate
or
illustration
involving
a
nobleman
the
great
names
might
be
rather
at
times
to
be
sure
but
when
people
are
inclined
to
be
pleased
they
do
keep
putting
that
and
that
together
to
see
how
they
fit
and
whether
they
come
naturally
or
are
lugged
in
neck
and
heels
puff
talk
was
very
telling
one
great
man
to
a
house
is
the
usual
country
allowance
and
many
are
not
very
long
in
letting
out
who
theirs
are
but
puffington
seemed
to
have
the
whole
peerage
baronetage
and
knightage
at
command
old
slyboots
indeed
thought
that
he
must
be
connected
with
the
peerage
some
way
his
mother
perhaps
had
been
the
daughter
of
a
peer
and
she
gave
herself
an
infinity
of
trouble
in
hunting
through
the
with
what
success
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
the
old
ladies
unanimously
agreed
that
he
was
a
most
agreeable
interesting
young
man
and
though
the
young
ones
did
pretend
to
run
him
down
among
themselves
calling
him
ugly
and
so
on
it
was
only
in
the
vain
hope
of
dissuading
each
other
from
thinking
of
him
puffington
still
stuck
to
the
man
character
a
character
that
is
not
so
convenient
to
support
in
the
country
as
it
is
in
town
the
borough
of
swillingford
as
we
have
already
intimated
was
not
the
best
conducted
borough
in
the
world
indeed
when
we
say
that
the
principal
trade
of
the
place
was
poaching
our
country
readers
will
be
able
to
form
a
very
accurate
opinion
on
that
head
when
puff
took
possession
of
hanby
there
was
a
fair
show
of
pheasants
about
the
house
and
a
good
sprinkling
of
hares
and
partridges
over
the
estate
and
manor
generally
but
refusing
to
prosecute
the
first
poachers
that
were
caught
the
rest
took
the
hint
and
cleared
everything
off
in
a
week
dividing
the
plunder
among
them
they
also
burnt
his
river
and
bagged
his
fine
dorking
fowls
and
all
these
feats
being
accomplished
with
impunity
they
turned
their
attention
to
his
fat
sheep
is
only
a
mild
term
for
puff
was
a
perfect
in
the
way
of
generosity
he
gave
to
everything
and
everybody
and
did
not
seem
to
be
acquainted
with
any
smaller
sum
than
a
note
a
note
to
replace
giles
jolter
that
used
to
carry
his
own
game
for
the
poachers
to
the
poulterers
at
plunderstone
five
pounds
to
buy
dame
doubletongue
another
pig
though
she
had
only
just
given
three
pounds
for
the
one
that
died
five
pounds
towards
the
fire
at
farmer
scratchley
though
it
had
taken
place
two
years
before
puff
came
into
the
country
and
scratchley
had
been
living
upon
it
ever
since
and
sundry
other
five
pounds
to
other
equally
deserving
and
amiable
people
he
put
his
name
down
for
fifty
to
the
mangeysterne
hounds
without
ever
being
asked
which
reminds
us
that
we
ought
to
be
directing
our
attention
to
that
noble
establishment
it
is
hard
to
have
to
go
behind
the
scenes
of
an
hunt
and
we
will
be
as
brief
and
tender
with
the
cripples
as
we
can
the
mangeysterne
hounds
wanted
that
great
ingredient
of
prosperity
a
large
subscriber
to
whom
all
others
could
be
tributary
paying
or
not
as
might
be
convenient
the
consequence
was
they
were
always
up
the
spout
they
were
neither
a
scratch
pack
nor
a
regular
pack
but
something
betwixt
and
between
they
were
hunted
by
a
saddler
who
found
his
own
horses
and
sometimes
he
had
a
whip
and
sometimes
he
had
the
establishment
died
as
often
as
old
mantalini
himself
every
season
that
came
to
a
close
was
proclaimed
to
be
their
last
but
somehow
or
other
they
always
managed
to
scramble
into
existence
on
the
approach
of
another
it
is
a
way
indeed
that
delicate
packs
have
of
recruiting
their
finances
nevertheless
the
mangeysternes
did
look
very
like
coming
to
an
end
about
the
time
that
puffington
bought
hanby
house
the
saddler
huntsman
had
failed
john
doe
had
taken
one
of
his
screws
and
richard
roe
the
other
and
anybody
might
have
the
hounds
that
liked
puffington
then
turned
up
great
was
the
joy
diffused
throughout
the
mangeysterne
country
when
it
transpired
through
the
medium
of
his
valet
louis
bergamotte
that
lor
had
habit
in
his
wardrobe
not
only
habit
rouge
but
habit
blue
and
buff
that
he
used
to
sport
with
beaufort
and
the
badminton
hunt
coats
that
he
certainly
had
no
chance
of
ever
getting
into
again
but
still
which
he
kept
as
memorials
of
the
past
souvenirs
of
the
days
when
he
was
young
and
slim
the
could
just
as
soon
have
got
into
his
quart
bottle
as
puff
could
into
the
beaufort
coat
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
the
intelligence
of
their
existence
was
quickly
followed
by
the
aforesaid
cheque
a
meeting
of
the
mangeysterne
hunt
was
called
at
the
sign
of
the
thirsty
freeman
in
swillingford
sir
charles
figgs
knight
a
but
badly
paying
subscriber
in
the
chair
when
it
was
proposed
and
carried
unanimously
that
puffington
was
eminently
qualified
for
the
mastership
of
the
hunt
and
that
it
be
offered
to
him
accordingly
puff
he
recalled
his
early
exploits
with
and
old
beaufort
and
resolved
that
the
hunt
had
taken
a
right
view
of
his
abilities
in
coming
to
this
decision
he
perhaps
was
not
altogether
uninfluenced
by
a
plausible
subscription
list
which
seemed
about
equal
to
the
ordinary
expenses
supposing
that
any
reliance
could
be
placed
on
the
figures
and
calculations
of
sir
charles
all
those
however
who
have
had
anything
to
do
with
subscription
lists
and
in
these
days
of
universal
testimonializing
who
has
not
well
know
that
pounds
upon
paper
and
pounds
in
the
pocket
are
very
different
things
above
all
puff
felt
that
he
was
a
new
man
in
the
country
and
that
taking
the
hounds
would
give
him
weight
the
dogs
then
began
to
up
puffington
took
to
them
in
earnest
bought
a
and
shortened
his
military
stirrups
to
a
hunting
seat
chapter
xxxiii
a
swell
huntsman
one
evening
the
rattle
of
puff
brought
in
addition
to
the
usual
rush
of
helpers
an
extremely
smart
dapper
little
man
who
might
be
either
a
jockey
or
a
gentleman
or
both
or
neither
he
was
a
spruce
little
fellow
remarkably
natty
about
the
legs
indeed
all
over
his
hat
was
carefully
brushed
and
what
little
hair
appeared
below
its
slightly
curved
brim
was
of
the
mixture
of
say
fifty
years
his
face
though
somewhat
wrinkled
and
was
bright
and
healthy
and
there
was
a
twinkle
about
his
little
grey
eyes
that
spoke
of
quickness
and
watchful
observation
altogether
he
was
a
very
little
man
a
sort
of
man
that
would
know
what
you
were
going
to
say
before
you
had
well
broke
ground
he
wore
no
gills
and
his
neatly
tied
starcher
had
a
white
ground
with
small
black
spots
about
the
size
of
currants
the
slight
interregnum
between
it
and
his
striped
vest
blue
stripe
on
a
ground
showed
three
golden
foxes
heads
acting
as
studs
to
his
neatly
plaited
shirt
while
a
sort
of
careless
turn
back
of
the
right
cuff
showed
similar
ornaments
at
his
wrists
his
cutaway
coat
was
oxford
mixture
with
a
thin
cord
binding
and
very
natty
light
kerseymere
buttoned
breeches
met
a
pair
of
bright
beautifully
fitting
tops
that
wrinkled
most
elegantly
down
to
the
spur
he
was
a
remarkably
well
got
up
little
man
and
looked
the
horseman
all
over
as
he
emerged
from
the
stable
where
he
had
been
mastering
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
establishment
learning
what
was
allowed
and
what
was
not
what
had
not
been
found
fault
with
and
therefore
might
be
presumed
upon
and
so
on
he
carried
the
smart
dogskin
leather
glove
of
one
hand
in
the
other
while
the
fox
head
of
a
massive
peered
from
under
his
arm
on
a
ring
round
the
fox
neck
was
the
following
inscription
jack
bragg
to
his
cousin
dick
puffington
having
drawn
up
his
and
thrown
the
ribbons
to
the
active
grooms
at
the
horses
heads
in
the
true
coaching
style
proceeded
to
descend
from
his
throne
and
had
reached
the
ground
ere
he
was
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
stranger
seeing
him
then
he
made
the
sort
of
of
a
man
that
does
not
know
whether
he
is
addressing
a
gentleman
or
a
servant
or
maybe
a
scamp
going
about
with
a
prospectus
puff
had
been
bit
in
the
matter
of
some
maps
in
london
and
was
wary
as
all
people
ought
to
be
of
these
birds
the
stranger
came
sidling
up
with
a
of
the
hat
drawling
out
me
sir
me
sir
with
another
and
another
of
the
hat
mister
bragg
sir
mister
richard
bragg
sir
of
whom
you
have
most
likely
heard
richard
bragg
repeated
our
friend
thoughtfully
while
he
scanned
the
man
features
and
ran
his
sporting
acquaintance
through
his
eye
bragg
repeated
he
without
hitting
him
off
was
huntsman
sir
to
my
lord
reynard
sir
observed
the
stranger
with
a
touch
of
the
hat
to
each
you
might
have
known
his
ludship
sir
before
him
sir
i
held
office
sir
under
the
duke
of
downeybird
sir
of
downeybird
castle
sir
in
downeybirdshire
sir
replied
puffington
with
a
and
a
smile
of
politeness
sir
you
had
taken
these
mangeysterne
sir
continued
the
stranger
with
rather
a
significant
emphasis
on
the
word
sir
you
had
taken
these
mangeysterne
sir
it
occurred
to
me
that
possibly
i
might
be
useful
to
you
sir
in
your
new
calling
sir
and
if
you
were
of
the
same
opinion
sir
why
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
negotiate
a
connexion
sir
hem
hem
coughed
puffington
the
way
of
a
huntsman
do
you
mean
afraid
to
talk
of
servitude
to
so
fine
a
gentleman
so
said
bragg
with
a
chuck
of
his
head
so
the
fact
is
though
i
used
to
the
grass
countries
sir
and
could
go
to
the
marquis
of
maneylies
sir
sir
i
should
prefer
a
quiet
place
in
a
somewhat
inferior
country
sir
to
a
one
in
the
best
five
and
six
days
a
week
sir
is
a
terrible
tax
sir
on
the
constitution
sir
and
though
sir
i
thankful
to
say
sir
i
pretty
good
sir
yet
sir
you
know
sir
it
do
do
sir
to
take
too
great
liberties
with
oneself
sir
bragg
sawing
away
at
his
hat
as
he
spoke
measuring
off
a
touch
as
it
were
to
each
the
action
becoming
quick
towards
the
end
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
puff
looking
rather
sheepish
tell
you
the
truth
i
intended
i
thought
at
least
of
of
of
hunting
them
myself
that
another
pair
of
shoes
altogether
as
we
say
in
france
replied
bragg
with
a
low
bow
and
a
copious
round
of
the
hand
to
the
hat
pair
of
shoes
altogether
repeated
he
tapping
his
boot
with
his
whip
i
of
it
rejoined
puff
not
feeling
quite
sure
whether
he
could
or
not
said
bragg
drawing
on
his
dogskin
glove
as
if
to
be
off
friend
swellcove
does
it
observed
puff
replied
bragg
but
my
lord
swellcove
is
one
of
a
thousand
see
how
many
have
failed
for
one
that
has
succeeded
why
even
my
lord
scamperdale
was
to
give
it
up
and
no
man
rides
harder
than
my
lord
scamperdale
always
goes
as
if
he
had
a
spare
neck
in
his
pocket
but
he
could
a
pack
of
your
are
all
very
well
on
fine
scentin
days
when
everything
goes
smoothly
and
well
and
the
are
tied
to
their
fox
as
it
were
but
see
them
in
difficulties
a
failing
scent
pressed
upon
by
the
field
fox
chased
by
a
dog
storm
in
the
air
big
brook
to
get
over
to
make
a
cast
oh
sir
sir
it
makes
even
me
with
all
my
acknowledged
science
and
experience
shudder
to
think
of
the
ordeal
one
undergoes
exclaimed
puffington
staring
and
beginning
to
think
it
might
be
quite
so
easy
as
it
looked
do
wish
sir
to
dissuade
you
sir
from
the
attempt
sir
continued
bragg
from
it
sir
for
he
sir
who
never
makes
an
effort
sir
never
risks
a
failure
sir
and
in
great
attempts
sir
is
glorious
to
fail
sir
bragg
sawing
away
at
his
hat
as
he
spoke
and
then
sticking
the
handle
of
his
whip
under
his
chin
puff
stood
mute
for
some
seconds
lord
scamperdale
continued
bragg
scrutinizing
our
friend
attentively
as
likely
a
man
sir
as
ever
i
see
sir
to
make
an
for
he
had
a
deal
of
ret
rat
ketchin
cunnin
about
him
and
as
i
said
before
did
care
one
dim
for
his
neck
but
a
more
signal
disastrous
failure
was
never
recognized
it
was
quite
lamentable
to
witness
his
proceeding
asked
puffington
sir
repeated
bragg
sir
in
all
wayses
he
had
no
dog
language
to
begin
with
he
had
little
idea
of
making
a
cast
no
science
no
judgement
no
manner
no
nothin
i
dim
if
ever
i
see
sich
a
mess
as
he
made
puff
looked
unutterable
things
never
did
no
good
in
fact
till
i
fit
him
with
frostyface
taught
frosty
continued
bragg
whipped
in
to
me
when
i
the
duke
of
downeybird
nice
civil
chap
he
was
of
all
my
pupils
and
i
made
some
i
dim
if
i
do
think
frostyface
does
me
about
as
much
credit
as
any
on
ah
sir
continued
bragg
with
a
shake
of
his
head
my
word
for
it
sir
nothin
like
a
professional
me
sir
added
he
with
a
low
bow
and
a
sort
of
military
salute
of
his
hat
dim
all
say
i
bragg
had
talked
himself
into
several
good
places
lord
reynard
and
the
duke
of
downeybird
among
others
he
had
never
been
able
to
keep
any
beyond
his
third
season
his
sauce
or
his
science
being
always
greater
than
the
sport
he
showed
still
he
kept
up
appearances
and
was
nothing
daunted
it
being
a
maxim
of
his
that
one
door
closed
another
opened
puffington
was
the
door
that
now
opened
for
him
what
greater
humiliation
can
a
briton
be
subjected
to
than
paying
a
man
eighty
or
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
finding
him
house
coals
and
candles
and
perhaps
a
cow
to
be
his
master
such
was
the
case
with
poor
puffington
and
such
we
grieve
to
say
is
the
case
with
of
the
men
who
keep
hounds
with
all
indeed
save
those
who
can
hunt
themselves
or
who
are
blest
with
an
aspiring
whip
ready
to
step
into
the
huntsman
boots
if
he
seems
inclined
to
put
them
off
in
the
field
how
many
portly
butlers
are
kept
in
subjection
by
having
a
footman
ready
to
supplant
them
of
all
cards
in
the
servitude
pack
however
the
huntsman
is
the
most
difficult
one
to
play
a
man
may
say
dim
if
i
wo
clean
my
own
boots
or
my
own
horse
before
i
put
up
with
such
a
fellow
impudence
but
when
it
comes
to
hunting
his
own
hounds
it
is
quite
another
pair
of
shoes
as
bragg
would
say
bragg
regularly
took
possession
of
poor
puff
as
regularly
as
a
policeman
takes
possession
of
a
prisoner
the
reader
knows
the
sort
of
feeling
one
has
when
a
lawyer
a
doctor
an
architect
or
any
one
whom
we
have
called
in
to
assist
takes
the
initiative
and
treats
one
as
a
nonentity
all
one
pet
ideas
and
upsetting
all
arrangements
bragg
soon
saw
he
had
a
greenhorn
to
deal
with
and
treated
puff
accordingly
if
a
servant
is
only
to
be
got
out
of
the
establishments
of
the
great
bragg
might
be
looked
upon
as
a
paragon
of
perfection
and
now
combined
in
his
own
person
all
the
bad
practices
of
all
the
places
he
had
been
in
having
puffington
situation
as
the
elegant
phraseology
of
servitude
goes
he
considered
that
puffington
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
hounds
and
that
any
interference
in
department
was
a
piece
of
impertinence
puffington
felt
like
a
man
who
has
bought
a
good
horse
but
which
he
finds
on
riding
is
rather
more
of
a
horse
than
he
likes
he
had
no
doubt
that
bragg
was
a
good
man
but
he
thought
he
was
rather
more
of
a
gentleman
than
he
required
on
the
other
hand
bragg
opinion
of
his
master
may
be
gleaned
from
the
following
letter
which
he
wrote
to
his
successor
mr
brick
at
lord
reynard
house
swillingford
brick
your
old
man
is
done
daffling
with
your
draft
i
should
like
to
have
the
pick
of
it
i
with
one
puffington
a
city
gent
his
father
was
a
great
confectioner
in
the
poultry
just
by
the
mansion
house
and
made
his
money
out
of
lord
mares
i
shall
only
stay
with
him
till
i
can
get
myself
suited
in
the
rank
of
life
in
which
i
have
been
accustomed
to
move
but
in
the
meantime
i
consider
it
necessary
for
my
own
credit
to
do
things
as
they
should
be
you
know
my
sort
of
hound
good
shoulders
deep
chests
strong
loins
straight
legs
round
feet
with
plenty
of
bone
all
over
i
hate
a
weedy
animal
a
small
hound
light
of
bone
is
only
fit
to
hunt
a
kat
in
a
kitchen
shall
also
want
a
couple
of
whips
not
fellows
like
waiters
from
hotel
but
light
active
not
boys
i
have
nothin
to
do
with
boys
every
boy
requires
a
man
to
look
arter
him
no
a
couple
of
short
light
active
men
say
from
to
thirty
with
and
good
cheery
voices
as
nearly
of
the
same
make
as
you
can
find
them
i
shall
not
give
them
large
wage
you
know
but
they
will
have
opportunities
of
improving
themselves
under
me
and
qualifying
themselves
for
high
places
but
mind
they
be
i
keep
no
unsteady
servants
the
first
act
of
drunkenness
with
me
is
the
last
shall
also
want
a
second
horseman
and
here
i
would
mind
a
mute
boy
who
could
keep
his
elbows
down
and
never
touch
the
curb
but
he
must
be
bred
in
the
line
a
huntsman
second
horseman
is
a
critical
article
and
the
sporting
world
must
not
be
put
in
mourning
for
dick
bragg
the
lad
will
have
to
clean
my
boots
and
wait
at
table
when
i
have
company
yourself
for
instance
is
only
a
poor
rough
ungentlemanly
sort
of
shire
as
far
as
i
have
seen
it
and
however
they
got
on
with
the
things
i
found
that
they
called
hounds
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
i
understand
they
went
stringing
over
the
country
like
a
flock
of
wild
geese
however
i
have
rectified
that
in
a
manner
by
knocking
all
the
fast
and
slow
on
the
head
and
i
shall
require
at
least
twenty
couple
before
i
can
take
the
field
in
your
official
report
of
what
your
old
file
puts
back
you
have
the
kindness
to
cobble
us
up
good
long
pedigrees
and
carry
half
of
them
at
least
back
to
the
beaufort
justice
my
man
has
got
a
crochet
into
his
head
about
that
hound
and
i
dimmed
if
he
does
think
half
the
hounds
in
england
are
descended
from
the
beaufort
justice
these
hounds
are
at
present
called
the
mangeysternes
a
very
proper
title
i
should
say
from
all
i
seen
and
heard
that
however
must
be
changed
and
we
must
have
a
button
struck
instead
of
the
plain
pewter
plates
the
men
have
been
in
the
habit
of
hunting
in
to
horses
i
sure
i
do
know
what
we
are
to
do
in
that
line
our
pastrycook
seems
to
think
that
a
hunter
like
one
of
his
pa
pies
can
be
made
and
baked
in
a
day
he
talks
of
going
over
to
rowdedow
fair
and
picking
some
up
himself
but
i
should
say
a
gentleman
demeans
himself
sadly
who
interferes
with
the
just
prerogative
of
the
groom
it
has
never
been
allowed
i
know
in
any
place
i
have
lived
nor
do
i
think
servants
do
justice
to
themselves
or
their
order
who
submit
to
it
howsomever
the
crittur
has
what
cobden
would
call
the
raw
material
for
sport
that
is
to
say
plenty
of
money
and
i
must
see
and
apply
it
in
such
a
way
as
will
produce
it
i
do
the
thing
as
it
should
be
or
not
at
all
hope
your
good
lady
is
well
also
all
the
little
bricks
i
purpose
making
a
little
tower
of
some
of
the
best
kennels
as
soon
as
the
drafts
are
arranged
and
will
spend
a
day
or
two
with
you

see

i
hope
your
old
man
keeps
a
cleaner
tongue
in
his
head
than
he
did

i
was

always
say
there
was
a
good
bargeman

made

chapter
xxxiv
the
beaufort
justice
there
is
nothing
more
indicative
of
real
fine
people
than
the
easy
indifferent
sort
of
way
they
take
leave
of
their
friends
they
never
seem
to
care
a
farthing
for
parting
our
friend
jawleyford
was
quite
a
man
of
fashion
in
this
respect
he
saw
sponge
preparations
for
departure
with
an
unconcerned
air
and
a
you
going
was
all
that
accompanied
an
imitation
shake
or
rather
touch
of
the
hand
on
leaving
there
was
no
hope
we
shall
see
you
again
soon
or
look
in
if
you
are
passing
our
way
or
that
you
found
your
way
here
we
hope
you
not
be
long
in
being
back
or
any
of
those
blarneyments
that
fools
take
for
earnest
and
wise
men
for
nothing
jawleyford
had
been
bit
once
and
he
was
not
going
to
give
sponge
a
second
chance
amelia
too
we
are
sorry
to
say
did
not
seem
particularly
distressed
though
she
gave
him
just
as
much
of
a
sweet
look
as
he
squeezed
her
hand
as
said
if
you
be
a
man
of
money
and
my
lord
scamperdale
does
not
make
me
my
lady
you
may
there
is
an
old
saying
that
it
is
well
to
be
with
the
old
love
before
one
is
on
with
the
new
and
amelia
thought
it
was
well
to
be
on
with
the
new
love
before
she
was
off
with
the
old
sponge
therefore
was
to
be
in
abeyance
we
mentioned
the
delight
infused
into
jawleyford
court
by
the
receipt
of
lord
scamperdale
letter
volunteering
a
visit
nor
was
his
lordship
less
gratified
at
hearing
in
reply
that
sponge
was
on
the
eve
of
departure
leaving
the
coast
clear
for
his
reception
his
lordship
was
not
only
delighted
at
getting
rid
of
his
horror
but
at
proving
the
superiority
of
his
judgement
over
that
of
jack
who
had
always
stoutly
maintained
that
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
sponge
was
by
buying
his
horses
that
said
his
lordship
as
he
read
the
letter
repeated
he
with
a
hearty
slap
of
his
thigh
not
such
a
bad
chap
after
all
worse
chaps
in
the
world
than
jaw
and
his
lordship
worked
away
at
the
point
till
he
very
nearly
got
him
up
to
be
a
good
chap
they
say
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
and
letters
seldom
come
singly
at
least
if
they
do
they
are
quickly
followed
by
others
as
jack
and
his
lordship
were
discussing
their
gin
after
a
repast
of
and
baggs
entered
with
the
old
brown
containing
a
county
paper
the
copy
of
that
his
lordship
and
frostyface
took
in
between
them
and
a
very
natty
paper
note
must
be
from
a
woman
observed
jack
squinting
ardently
at
the
writing
as
his
lordship
inspected
the
fine
seal
far
wrong
replied
his
lordship
a
bitch
of
a
fellow
at
all
events
said
he
reading
the
words
house
in
the
wax
can
old
puffey
be
wanting
now
inquired
jack
bother
about
hounds
most
likely
replied
his
lordship
breaking
the
seal
adding
thing
always
amusing
itself
with
playing
at
sportsman
hang
his
impudence
exclaimed
his
lordship
as
he
opened
the
note
happened
now
asked
jack
d
think
he
begins
asked
his
lordship
looking
at
his
friend
tell
i
sure
said
jack
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
scamp
exclaimed
his
lordship
throwing
out
his
arms
scamp
repeated
jack
in
astonishment
must
be
a
mistake
it
must
be
dear
frost
not
dear
scamp
scamp
is
the
word
replied
his
lordship
again
applying
himself
to
the
letter
scamp
repeated
he
with
a

jack
exclaimed
his
lordship
adding
lay

his
lordship
then
picked
the
letter
from
the

and
resumed

his

his
reading

repeated
his
lordship
beaufort
justice

for
a

interrupted
jack
adding
got
the
name
into
his
head
at
oxford
and
has
been
harping
upon
it
ever
since
i
think
i
have
a
hound
that
may
be
useful
to
you
resumed
his
lordship
for
the
third
time
it
is
old
merriman
a
remarkably
stout
true
line
hunting
hound
but
who
is
getting
slow
for
me
slow
for
you
you
beggar
exclaimed
his
lordship
should
have
thought
nothin
short
of
a
wooden
would
have
been
too
slow
for
you
he
a
hunter
and
is

his

if

did

that
as
well
as
him
by
the
brocklesby
that
marmion
out
of
petre
matchless
and
marmion
was
by
that
undeniable
hound
the
the
what
asked
his
lordship
justice
to
be
sure
replied
jack
the
beaufort
justice
read
his
lordship
with
due
emphasis
exclaimed
jack
waving
the
dirty
mustardy
copy
of
over
his
head
i
told
you
so
hark
to
justice
exclaimed
his
lordship
resuming
his
reading
always
been
a
great
admirer
of
the
beaufort
justice
blood
doubt
said
jack
the
only
blood
you
know
it
was
in
great
repute
in
the
badminton
country
in
old
beaufort
time
with
whom
i
hunted
a
great
deal
many
years
ago
i
sorry
to
say
the
late
warde
who
of
course
was
very
justly
partial
to
his
own
sort
had
never
any
objection
to
breeding
from
this
justice
he
was
of
lord
egremont
blood
by
the
new
forest
justice
justice
by
jasper
and
jasper
bred
by
egremont
oh
the
hosier
exclaimed
his
lordship
be
the
death
of
me
that
all
asked
jack
as
his
lordship
seemed
lost
in
meditation
no
replied
he
starting
up
adding
something
about
you
exclaimed
jack
if
spraggon
is
with
you
and
you
like
to
bring
him
i
can
manage
to
put
him
up
too
read
his
lordship
think
you
of
that
asked
his
lordship
turning
to
our
friend
who
was
now
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
with
anger
of
it
retorted
jack
kicking
out
his
legs
of
it
why
i
think
he
a
dim
impittant
feller
as
bragg
would
say
he
is
replied
his
lordship
my
friend
jack
so
a
good
mind
to
go
observed
jack
after
a
pause
thinking
he
might
punish
puff
and
try
to
do
a
little
business
with
sponge
a
good
mind
to
go
repeated
he
by
way
of
paying
master
puff
off
he
a
consequential
jackass
and
wants
taking
down
a
peg
or
two
think
you
may
as
well
go
and
do
it
replied
his
lordship
after
thinking
the
matter
over
think
you
may
as
well
go
and
do
it
not
that
he
be
good
to
take
the
conceit
out
of
but
you
may
vex
him
a
bit
and
also
learn
something
of
the
movements
of
his
friend
sponge
if
he
sarves
puff
out
as
he
sarved
me
continued
his
lordship
rubbing
his
ribs
with
his
elbows
very
soon
have
enough
of
him
said
jack
really
think
it
will
be
worth
doing
i
never
been
at
the
beggar
shop
and
they
say
he
lives
well
aye
exclaimed
his
lordship
o
the
land
dare
say
that
man
has
fish
and
soup
every
day
to
read
by
most
likely
observed
jack
squinting
at
the
dim
that
baggs
now
brought
in
so
grand
as
that
observed
his
lordship
doubting
whether
any
man
could
be
guilty
of
such
extravagance
it
being
decided
that
jack
should
answer
puffington
invitation
as
well
and
saucily
as
he
could
and
a
sheet
of
very
inferior
paper
being
at
length
discovered
in
the
sideboard
drawer
our
friends
forthwith
proceeded
to
concoct
it
jack
having
at
length
got
all
square
and
the
lines
introduced
below
dipped
his
pen
in
the
little
stone
and
squinting
up
at
his
lordship
said
shall
i
begin
replied
he
oh
let
see
begin
begin
dear
puff
to
be
sure
do
said
jack
writing
away
puff
sneered
our
friend
when
he
read
it
idea
of
a
fellow
like
that
writing
to
a
man
of
my
that
way
scamp
continued
his
lordship
dictating
again
is
engaged
but
i
be
with
you
at
engaged
read
puffington
with
a
contemptuous
curl
of
the
lip
engaged
i
like
the
impudence
of
a
fellow
like
that
calling
noblemen
nicknames
the
letter
concluded
by
advising
puffington
to
stick
to
the
beaufort
justice
blood
for
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
like
it
and
now
having
got
both
our
friends
booked
for
visits
we
must
yield
precedence
to
the
nobleman
and
accompany
him
to
jawleyford
court
illustration
lord
scamperdale
as
he
appeared
in
his
clothes
chapter
xxxv
lord
scamperdale
at
jawleyford
court
although
we
have
hitherto
depicted
lord
scamperdale
either
in
his
great
uncouth
or
in
the
red
and
yellow
stunner
tartan
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
he
had
not
fine
clothes
when
he
chose
to
wear
them
only
he
wanted
to
save
them
as
he
said
to
be
married
in
that
he
had
fine
ones
indeed
was
evident
from
the
he
lent
jack
when
that
worthy
went
to
jawleyford
court
and
in
addition
to
those
which
were
of
the
evening
order
he
had
an
uncommonly
smart
stultz
with
a
velvet
collar
facings
and
cuffs
and
a
silk
lining
though
so
rough
and
ready
among
the
men
he
was
quite
the
dandy
among
the
ladies
and
was
as
anxious
about
his
appearance
as
a
girl
of
sixteen
he
got
himself
clipped
and
trimmed
and
shaved
with
the
greatest
care
curving
his
whiskers
high
on
to
the
cheekbones
leaving
a
great
breadth
of
bare
fallow
below
baggs
the
butler
was
despatched
betimes
to
jawleyford
court
with
the
freighted
with
clothes
driven
by
a
groom
to
attend
to
the
horses
while
his
lordship
mounted
his
galloping
grey
hack
towards
noon
and
dashed
through
the
country
like
a
comet
the
people
who
were
only
accustomed
to
see
him
in
his
short
baggy
breeches
and
shapeless
boots
could
hardly
recognize
the
swell
as
lord
scamperdale
even
titus
grabbington
the
superintendent
of
police
declared
that
he
would
have
known
him
but
for
his
hat
and
specs
the
latter
we
need
hardly
say
were
the
silver
ones
the
pair
that
he
would
not
let
jack
have
when
he
went
to
jawleyford
court
so
his
lordship
went
capering
and
careering
along
avoiding
of
course
all
the
of
which
he
had
a
mortal
aversion
jawleyford
court
was
in
full
dress
to
receive
him
everything
was
full
fig
spigot
appeared
in
buckled
shorts
and
black
silk
stockings
while
vases
of
evergreens
and
winter
flowers
mounted
sentry
on
passage
tables
and
everything
bespoke
the
elegant
presence
of
the
fair
to
the
credit
of
dame
fortune
let
us
record
that
everything
went
smoothly
and
well
even
the
kitchen
fire
behaved
as
it
ought
neither
did
lord
scamperdale
arrive
before
he
was
wanted
a
very
common
custom
with
people
unused
to
public
visiting
he
cast
up
just
when
he
was
wanted
his
ring
of
the
acted
like
the
little
tinkling
bell
at
a
theatre
sending
all
parties
to
their
places
for
the
curtain
to
rise
spigot
and
his
two
footmen
answered
the
summons
while
his
lordship
groom
rushed
out
of
a
with
his
mouth
full
of
cold
meat
to
take
his
hack
having
given
his
flat
hat
to
spigot
his
to
one
footman
and
his
gloves
to
the
other
he
proceeded
to
the
family
tableau
in
the
though
his
lordship
lived
so
much
by
himself
he
was
neither
nor
stupid
when
he
went
into
society
unlike
spraggon
he
had
a
tremendous
determination
of
words
to
the
mouth
and
went
best
pace
with
his
tongue
instead
of
coughing
and
hemming
and
stammering
and
stuttering
wishing
himself
out
of
it
as
the
saying
is
his
seclusion
only
seemed
to
sharpen
his
faculties
and
make
him
enjoy
society
more
he
gushed
forth
like
a
fountain
he
was
not
a
bit
afraid
of
the
ladies
rather
the
contrary
indeed
he
would
make
love
to
them
all
all
that
were
at
least
for
he
always
candidly
said
that
he
have
anything
to
do
with
the
ugly
if
anything
he
was
rather
too
vehement
and
talked
to
the
ladies
in
such
an
earnest
interested
sort
of
way
as
made
even
bystanders
think
there
was
in
it
whereas
in
point
of
fact
it
was
mere
manner
he
began
as
soon
as
ever
he
got
to
jawleyford
court
at
least
as
soon
as
he
had
paid
his
respects
all
round
and
got
himself
partially
thawed
at
the
fire
for
the
cold
had
struck
through
his
person
his
fine
clothes
being
a
poor
substitute
for
his
thick
red
coat
blankety
waistcoat
and
jersey
shirt
there
are
some
people
in
this
world
who
think
that
can
talk
of
nothing
but
hunting
and
who
put
themselves
to
very
serious
inconvenience
in
endeavouring
to
get
up
a
little
conversation
for
them
we
knew
a
bulky
old
boy
of
this
sort
who
invariably
after
the
cloth
was
drawn
and
he
had
given
each
leg
a
kick
out
to
see
if
they
were
on
commenced
with
i
suppose
harkington
has
a
fine
set
of
dogs
this
season
fine
set
of
dogs
this
season
an
observation
how
on
earth
could
any
one
hope
to
drive
a
conversation
on
the
subject
with
such
a
commencement
some
ladies
are
equally
obliging
in
this
respect
they
can
stoop
to
almost
any
subject
that
they
think
will
procure
them
husbands
music
if
a
man
is
fond
of
music
they
will
sing
themselves
into
his
good
graces
in
no
time
painting
oh
they
adore
painting
though
in
general
they
do
profess
to
be
great
hands
at
it
themselves
balls
boating
archery
racing
all
these
they
can
take
a
lively
interest
in
or
if
occasion
requires
can
go
on
the
serious
tack
and
hunt
a
parson
with
penny
subscriptions
for
a
or
we
do
not
know
that
is
so
safe
a
speculation
for
young
ladies
as
any
of
the
foregoing
there
are
many
pros
and
cons
in
the
matter
of
the
chase
a
man
may
think
especially
in
these
hard
times
with
below
forty
as
springwheat
would
say
that
it
will
be
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
mount
himself
again
he
may
not
think
a
lady
looks
any
better
for
running
down
with
perspiration
and
being
daubed
with
mud
above
all
if
he
belongs
to
the
worshipful
company
of
craners
he
may
not
like
for
his
wife
to
be
seen
beating
him
across
country
still
there
are
many
ways
that
young
ladies
may
insinuate
themselves
into
the
good
graces
of
sportsmen
without
following
them
into
the
talking
about
their
horses
above
all
admiring
them
taking
an
interest
in
their
sport
seeing
that
they
have
nice
papers
of
sandwiches
to
take
out
with
them
or
recommending
them
to
be
bled
when
they
come
home
with
dirty
faces
after
falls
miss
amelia
jawleyford
who
was
most
elegantly
attired
in
a
silk
dress
with
large
imitation
pearl
buttons
claiming
the
usual
privilege
of
seniority
of
birth
very
soon
led
the
charge
against
lord
scamperdale
what
a
lovely
horse
that
is
you
were
riding
observed
she
as
his
lordship
kept
stooping
with
both
his
little
red
fists
close
into
the
bars
of
the
grate
it
exclaimed
he
rubbing
his
hands
heartily
together
it
repeated
he
adding
what
i
call
a
clipper
do
you
call
it
so
asked
she
i
do
mean
that
clipper
is
its
name
replied
he
we
call
her
cherry
bounce
in
the
stable
but
she
what
they
call
a
clipper
a
good
to
go
you
know
continued
he
staring
at
the
fair
speaker
through
his
great
formidable
spectacles
we
believe
there
is
nothing
frightens
a
woman
so
much
as
staring
at
her
through
spectacles
a
barrister
in
barnacles
is
a
far
more
formidable
than
one
without
but
to
his
lordship
back
he
eat
bread
out
of
your
hand
asked
amelia
adding
so
like
a
horse
that
would
eat
bread
out
of
my
hand
yes
or
cheese
either
replied
his
lordship
who
was
a
bit
of
a
wag
and
as
likely
to
try
a
horse
with
one
as
the
other
how
delightful
what
a
charming
horse
exclaimed
amelia
turning
her
fine
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
you
fond
of
horses
asked
his
lordship
smacking
one
hand
against
the
other
making
a
noise
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
so
fond
exclaimed
amelia
with
a
start
for
she
had
got
through
her
favourite
and
as
she
thought
most
attractive
attitude
now
that
nice
said
his
lordship
giving
his
other
hand
a
similar
bang
adding
like
a
woman
that
fond
of
horses
and
you
nicely
observed
jawleyford
who
was
always
ready
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
her
own
daughters
at
least
do
doubt
it
replied
his
lordship
with
emphasis
and
a
third
bang
of
his
hand
louder
if
possible
than
before
do
like
horses
asked
his
lordship
darting
sharply
round
on
emily
who
had
been
yielding
or
rather
submitting
to
the
precedence
of
her
sister
yes
and
hounds
too
replied
she
eagerly
hounds
too
exclaimed
his
lordship
with
a
start
and
another
hearty
bang
of
the
fist
adding
now
i
like
a
woman
that
likes
hounds
amelia
frowned
at
the
unhandsome
march
her
sister
had
stolen
upon
her
just
then
in
came
jawleyford
much
to
the
annoyance
of
all
parties
a
host
should
never
show
before
the
rings
when
that
glad
sound
was
at
length
heard
the
ladies
as
usual
immediately
withdrew
and
of
course
the
first
thing
amelia
did
when
she
got
to
her
room
was
to
run
to
the
glass
to
see
how
she
had
been
looking
when
grievous
to
relate
she
found
an
angry
hot
spot
in
the
act
of
breaking
out
on
her
nose
what
a
distressing
situation
for
a
young
lady
especially
one
with
a
spectacled
suitor
dear
she
thought
as
she
eyed
it
in
the
glass
will
look
like
vesuvius
itself
through
his
formidable
inquisitors
worst
of
all
it
was
on
the
side
she
would
have
next
him
at
dinner
should
he
choose
to
sit
with
his
back
to
the
fire
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
the
maid
kindly
assuring
her
as
she
worked
away
at
her
hair
that
it
never
be
seen
she
ceased
to
watch
it
and
turned
her
attention
to
her
toilette
the
fine
new
flounced
satin
dress
a
dress
so
much
like
a
ball
dress
as
to
be
only
appreciable
as
a
dinner
one
by
female
eyes
was
again
in
requisition
while
her
fine
arms
were
encircled
with
chains
and
armlets
of
various
brilliance
and
devices
thus
attired
with
a
parting
inspection
of
the
spot
she
swept
downstairs
with
as
smart
a
bouquet
as
the
season
would
afford
as
luck
would
have
it
she
encountered
his
lordship
himself
wandering
about
the
passage
in
search
of
the
of
whose
door
he
had
not
made
a
sufficient
observation
on
leaving
he
too
was
uncommonly
smart
with
the
identical
spraggon
wore
a
white
waistcoat
with
turquoise
buttons
a
shirt
and
a
most
extensive
joinville
he
had
been
eminently
successful
in
accomplishing
a
tie
that
would
almost
rival
the
sticks
farmers
put
upon
truant
geese
to
prevent
their
getting
through
gaps
or
under
gates
well
miss
amelia
having
come
to
his
lordship
assistance
and
eased
him
of
his
candle
now
showed
him
into
the
and
his
hands
being
disengaged
like
a
true
englishman
he
must
be
doing
and
accordingly
he
commenced
an
attack
on
her
bouquet
a
fine
nosegay
exclaimed
he
staring
and
rubbing
his
snub
nose
into
the
midst
of
it
me
give
you
a
piece
replied
amelia
proceeding
to
detach
some
of
the
best
replied
his
lordship
banging
one
hand
against
the
other
adding
wear
it
next
my
heart
of
hearts
in
sidled
miss
emily
just
as
his
lordship
was
adjusting
it
in
his
and
the
inconstant
man
immediately
chopped
over
to
her
now
that
a
beautiful
nosegay
exclaimed
he
turning
upon
her
in
precisely
the
same
way
with
a
bang
of
the
hand
and
a
dive
of
his
nose
into
emily
she
did
not
offer
him
any
and
his
lordship
continued
his
attentions
to
her
until
jawleyford
entered
dinner
was
presently
announced
but
his
lordship
instead
of
choosing
to
sit
with
his
back
to
the
fire
took
the
single
chair
opposite
which
gave
him
a
commanding
view
of
the
young
ladies
he
did
not
however
take
any
advantage
of
his
position
during
the
repast
neither
did
he
talk
much
his
maxim
being
to
let
his
meat
stop
his
mouth
the
preponderance
of
his
observations
perhaps
were
addressed
to
amelia
though
a
watchful
observer
might
have
seen
that
the
spectacles
were
oftener
turned
upon
emily
up
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
cloth
however
there
was
no
perceptible
advantage
on
either
side
illustration
as
his
lordship
settled
to
the
sweets
at
which
he
was
a
great
hand
at
dessert
amelia
essayed
to
try
her
influence
with
the
popular
subject
of
a
ball
wish
the
members
of
your
hunt
would
give
us
a
ball
my
lord
observed
she
hay
hum
ball
replied
he
ladling
up
the
syrup
of
some
preserved
peaches
that
he
had
been
eating
ball
ball
no
place
to
give
it
no
place
to
give
it
repeated
he
give
it
in
the
or
the
long
room
at
the
angel
replied
she

at
the
angel
angel
at
the
long
room
of
the
oh
certainly

muttered
he
scraping
away
at
the
contents
of
his
plate
that
a
bargain
mind
observed
amelia
significantly
bargain

certainly
replied
he
i
lead
off
with
you
or
you
lead
off
with
me
whichever
way
it
is
meanwhile
trouble
you
for
a
piece
of
that
gingerbread
having
supplied
him
with
a
most
liberal
slice
she
resumed
the
subject
of
the
ball
we
fix
it
so
observed
she
fix
it
so
certainly
certainly
fix
it
so
replied
his
lordship
filling
his
mouth
full
of
gingerbread
we
have
it
on
the
day
of
the
races
continued
amelia
be
better
replied
his
lordship
be
better
repeated
he
eyeing
her
intently
through
his
formidable
specs
his
lordship
was
quite
in
the
assenting
humour
and
would
have
agreed
to
anything
anything
short
of
lending
one
a
note
amelia
was
charmed
with
her
success
despite
the
spot
on
her
nose
she
felt
she
was
winning
his
lordship
sat
like
a
target
shot
at
by
all
but
making
the
most
of
his
time
both
in
the
way
of
eating
and
staring
between
questions
at
length
the
ladies
withdrew
and
his
lordship
having
waddled
to
the
door
to
assist
their
egress
now
availed
himself
of
jawleyford
invitation
to
occupy
an
during
the
enjoyment
of
his
whether
it
was
the
excellence
of
the
beverage
or
that
his
lordship
was
unaccustomed
to
or
that
jawleyford
conversation
was
unusually
agreeable
we
know
not
but
the
summons
to
tea
and
coffee
was
disregarded
and
when
at
length
they
did
make
their
appearance
his
lordship
was
what
the
ladies
call
rather
elevated
and
talked
thicker
than
there
was
any
occasion
for
he
was
very
voluble
at
first
told
all
how
sponge
had
knocked
him
about
how
he
detested
him
and
would
allow
him
to
come
to
the
hunt
ball
but
he
gradually
died
out
and
at
last
fell
asleep
beside
jawleyford
on
the
sofa
with
his
little
legs
crossed
and
a
in
his
hand
which
jawleyford
and
she
kept
anxiously
watching
expecting
the
contents
to
be
over
the
fine
satin
furniture
every
moment
in
this
pleasant
position
they
remained
till
he
awoke
himself
with
a
hearty
snore
and
turned
the
coffee
over
on
to
the
carpet
fortunately
there
was
little
damage
done
and
it
being
nearly
twelve
his
lordship
waddled
off
to
bed
amelia
when
she
came
to
think
matters
over
in
the
retirement
of
her
own
room
was
well
satisfied
with
the
progress
she
had
made
she
thought
she
only
wanted
opportunity
to
capture
him
though
she
was
most
anxious
for
a
good
night
in
order
that
she
might
appear
to
advantage
in
the
morning
sleep
forsook
her
eyelids
and
she
lay
awake
long
thinking
what
she
would
do
when
she
was
my
lady
how
she
would
warm
woodmansterne
and
what
a
dashing
equipage
she
would
keep
at
length
she
dropped
off
just
as
she
thought
she
was
getting
into
her
chariot
showing
a
becoming
portion
of
her
elegantly
turned
ankles
in
the
morning
she
attired
herself
in
her
new
light
blue
satin
robe
corsage
albanaise
with
a
sort
of
sleeves
and
muslin
under
ones
something
we
believe
out
of
the
last
book
of
fashion
she
also
had
her
hair
uncommonly
well
arranged
and
sported
a
pair
of
clean
gloves
for
victory
said
she
as
she
took
a
parting
glance
at
herself
in
general
and
the
hot
spot
in
particular
judge
of
her
disgust
on
meeting
her
mamma
on
the
staircase
at
learning
that
his
lordship
had
got
up
at
six
and
had
gone
to
meet
his
hounds
on
the
other
side
of
the
county
that
baggs
had
boiled
his
oatmeal
porridge
in
his
bedroom
and
his
lordship
had
eaten
it
as
he
was
dressing
it
may
be
asked
what
was
the
maid
about
not
to
tell
her
the
fact
is
that
are
only
numb
hands
in
all
that
relates
to
hunting
and
though
juliana
knew
that
his
lordship
was
up
she
thought
he
had
gone
to
have
his
hunt
before
breakfast
just
as
the
young
gentlemen
in
the
last
place
she
lived
in
used
to
go
and
have
a
bathe
illustration
baggs
we
may
add
was
a
married
man
and
juliana
and
he
had
not
had
much
conversation
chapter
xxxvi
bragg
kennel
management
the
reader
will
now
have
the
kindness
to
consider
that
puffington
has
undergone
his
swell
huntsman
dick
bragg
for
three
whole
years
during
which
time
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
his
winter
service
or
his
summer
impudence
was
most
oppressive
either
way
puffington
had
had
enough
both
of
him
and
the
honours
of
bragg
was
not
a
judicious
tyrant
he
lorded
it
too
much
over
puffington
was
too
fond
of
showing
himself
off
and
exposing
his
master
ignorance
before
the
servants
and
field
a
stranger
would
have
thought
that
bragg
and
not
puff
as
bragg
called
him
kept
the
hounds
puffington
took
it
pretty
quietly
at
first
bragg
inundating
him
with
what
they
did
at
the
duke
of
downeybird
lord
reynard
and
the
other
great
places
in
which
he
had
lived
till
he
almost
made
puff
believe
that
such
treatment
was
a
necessary
consequence
of
moreover
the
cost
was
heavy
and
the
promised
subscriptions
were
almost
wholly
imaginary
even
if
they
had
been
paid
they
would
not
have
covered
a
quarter
of
the
expense
bragg
ran
him
to
and
worst
of
all
there
was
an
increasing
instead
of
a
diminishing
expenditure
trust
a
servant
for
keeping
things
up
to
the
mark
all
things
however
have
an
end
and
bragg
began
to
get
to
the
end
of
mr
puff
patience
as
puff
got
older
he
got
fonder
of
his
notes
and
began
to
scrutinize
bills
and
ask
questions
to
be
as
bragg
said
little
of
the
gentleman
bragg
however
being
quite
one
of
your
sort
and
knowing
too
well
the
style
of
man
to
calculate
on
a
lengthened
duration
of
office
just
put
on
the
steam
of
extravagance
and
seemed
inclined
to
try
how
much
he
could
spend
for
his
master
his
bills
for
draft
hounds
were
enormous
he
was
continually
chopping
and
changing
his
horses
often
almost
without
consulting
his
master
he
had
a
perfect
museum
of
saddles
and
bridles
in
which
every
invention
and
variety
of
bit
was
exhibited
and
he
had
paid
as
much
as
twenty
pounds
to
different
and
grooms
for
invaluable
recipes
for
cleaning
leather
breeches
and
gloves
altogether
bragg
overdid
the
thing
and
when
puffington
in
the
solitude
of
a
winter
day
took
pen
ink
and
paper
and
drew
out
a
sheet
he
found
that
on
the
average
of
six
brace
of
foxes
to
the
season
they
had
cost
him
about
three
hundred
pounds
a
head
killing
it
was
true
that
bragg
always
returned
five
or
six
and
twenty
brace
but
that
was
as
between
bragg
and
the
public
as
between
bragg
and
his
master
the
smaller
figure
was
the
amount
puffington
had
had
enough
of
it
and
he
now
thought
if
he
could
get
sponge
who
he
still
believed
to
be
a
sporting
author
on
his
travels
to
immortalize
him
he
might
retire
into
privacy
and
talk
of
kept
hounds
hunted
the
country
was
master
of
hounds
did
this
and
did
that
and
fuss
and
be
important
as
we
often
see
of
hounds
when
they
go
out
with
other
packs
it
was
this
erroneous
impression
with
regard
to
sponge
that
took
our
friend
to
the
meet
of
lord
scamperdale
hounds
at
scrambleford
green
when
he
gave
sponge
a
general
invitation
to
visit
him
before
he
left
the
country
an
invitation
that
was
as
acceptable
to
sponge
on
his
expulsion
from
jawleyford
court
as
it
was
agreeable
to
puffington
by
opening
a
route
by
which
he
might
escape
from
the
penalty
of
and
the
persecution
of
his
huntsman
the
reader
will
therefore
now
have
the
kindness
to
consider
puffington
in
receipt
of
sponge
note
volunteering
a
visit
with
gay
and
cheerful
steps
our
friend
hurried
off
to
the
kennel
to
communicate
the
intelligence
to
bragg
of
an
intended
honour
that
he
inwardly
hoped
would
have
the
effect
of
extinguishing
that
great
sporting
luminary
arriving
at
the
kennel
he
learned
from
the
old
feeder
jack
horsehide
who
as
usual
was
sluicing
the
flags
with
water
though
the
weather
was
wet
that
bragg
was
in
the
house
a
house
that
had
been
the
in
the
days
of
the
former
owner
of
hanby
house
thither
puffington
proceeded
and
the
front
door
being
open
he
entered
and
made
for
the
little
parlour
on
the
right
opening
the
door
without
knocking
what
should
he
find
but
the
swell
huntsman
bragg
full
fig
in
his
cap
best
scarlet
and
leathers
astride
a
sitting
for
his
portrait
dim
it
exclaimed
bragg
clasping
the
front
of
the
stand
as
if
it
was
a
horse
and
throwing
himself
off
an
operation
that
had
the
effect
of
bringing
the
new
saddle
on
which
he
was
seated
bang
on
the
floor
me
sir
seeing
it
was
his
master
thought
it
was
my
servant
this
sir
continued
he
blushing
and
looking
as
foolish
as
men
do
when
caught
getting
their
hair
curled
or
sitting
for
their
portraits
sir
is
my
friend
ruddle
the
painter
sir
yes
sir
very
talented
young
man
sir
asked
me
to
sit
for
my
portrait
sir
is
going
to
publish
a
series
of
portraits
of
all
the
best
huntsmen
in
england
sir
masters
of
hounds
interposed
ruddle
casting
a
sheep
eye
at
puffington
masters
of
hounds
sir
repeated
bragg
sir
and
masters
of
hounds
sir
bragg
being
still
somewhat
flurried
at
the
unexpected
intrusion
well
interrupted
puffington
who
was
still
eager
about
his
mission
talk
about
that
after
at
present
i
come
to
tell
you
continued
he
holding
up
sponge
note
we
must
brush
up
a
little
going
to
have
a
visit
of
inspection
from
the
great
mr
sponge
sir
replied
bragg
with
the
slightest
possible
touch
of
his
cap
which
he
still
kept
on
sponge
sir
indeed
sir
sponge
sir
pray
who
may
be
sir
why
hay
hum
haw
he
sponge
you
know
been
hunting
with
lord
scamperdale
you
know
great
sportsman
in
fact
great
authority
you
know
great
authority
is
he
indeed
oh
yes
thinks
so
me
sir
but
sir
i
forgot
more
sir
than
sponge
ever
knew
sir
but
you
must
tell
him
so
observed
puffington
fearful
that
bragg
might
spoil
sport
tell
him
no
sneered
bragg
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
him
no
i
not
exactly
such
a
donkey
as
that
on
the
contrary
i
make
things
pleasant
sir
sugar
his
milk
for
him
sir
in
short
sir
his
milk
exclaimed
puffington
who
was
only
a
man
his
milk
i
dare
say
he
takes
tea
then
sugar
his
tea
replied
bragg
with
a
smile
adding
myself
sir
to
circumstances
sir
at
the
same
time
taking
off
his
cap
and
setting
a
chair
for
his
master
you
but
i
not
going
to
stay
replied
puffington
only
came
up
to
let
you
know
who
you
had
to
expect
so
that
you
might
prepare
you
know
have
all
on
the
square
you
know
best
horses
best
hounds
best
appearance
in
general
you
know
i
attend
to
replied
bragg
with
a
toss
of
the
head
attend
to
repeated
he
with
an
emphasis
on
the
as
much
as
to
say
you
meddle
with
what
does
concern
you
puffington
would
fain
have
rebuked
him
for
his
impertinence
as
indeed
he
often
would
fain
have
rebuked
him
but
bragg
had
so
overpowered
him
with
science
and
impressed
him
with
the
necessity
of
keeping
him
albeit
puffington
was
sensible
that
he
killed
very
few
foxes
that
having
put
up
with
him
so
long
he
thought
it
would
never
do
to
risk
a
quarrel
which
might
lose
him
the
chance
of
getting
rid
of
him
and
hounds
altogether
therefore
puffington
instead
of
saying
conceited
humbug
get
out
of
this
or
indulging
in
any
observations
that
might
lead
to
controversy
said
with
a
satisfied
confidential
nod
of
the
head
sure
you
will
i
sure
you
will
and
took
his
departure
leaving
bragg
to
remount
the
and
take
the
remainder
of
his
sitting
chapter

puffington
domestic
arrangements
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
that
bragg
did
take
the
kennel
management
upon
himself
or
there
is
no
saying
but
what
with
that
and
the
house
department
coupled
with
the
usual
fussiness
of
a
bachelor
the
sponge
visit
might
have
proved
too
much
for
our
master
the
notice
of
the
intended
visit
was
short
and
there
were
invitations
to
send
out
and
answers
to
get
bedrooms
to
prepare
and
culinary
arrangements
to
make
arrangements
that
people
in
town
with
all
their
tradespeople
at
their
elbows
can
have
no
idea
of
the
difficulty
of
effecting
in
the
country
puffington
was
fully
employed
in
addition
to
the
parties
mentioned
as
asked
in
his
note
to

captain

of
that
noble
corps
the

marines
and
others
who
accepted
spraggon
was
a
sort
of
volunteer
at
all
events
an
undesired
guest
unless
his
lordship
accompanied
him
it
so
happened
that
the
least
wanted
guest
was
the
first
to
arrive
on
the
day
lord
scamperdale
knowing
our
friend
jack
was
not
over
affluent
had
no
idea
of
spoiling
him
by
too
much
luxury
and
as
the
railway
would
serve
a
certain
distance
in
the
line
of
hanby
house
he
despatched
jack
to
the
station
with
the
and
told
him
he
would
be
sure
to
find
a
or
to
get
some
sort
of
conveyance
at
the
squandercash
station
to
take
him
up
to
puffington
at
all
events
his
lordship
added
to
himself
he
does
it
do
him
no
harm
to
walk
and
he
can
easily
get
a
boy
to
carry
his
bag
the
latter
was
the
case
for
though
the
assured
jack
on
his
arrival
at
squandercash
that
there
was
a
or
a
mail
gig
or
a
something
to
every
other
train
there
was
nothing
in
connexion
with
the
one
that
brought
him
nor
would
he
undertake
to
leave
his
at

before
the
next
morning
illustration
jack
protests
against
all
railways
jack
was
highly
enraged
and
proceeded
to
squint
his
eyes
inside
out
and
abuse
all
railways
and
chairmen
and
directors
and
secretaries
and
clerks
and
porters
vowing
that
railways
were
the
greatest
nuisances
under
the
sun
that
they
were
a
perfect
impediment
instead
of
a
facility
to
travelling
and
declared
that
formerly
a
gentleman
had
nothing
to
do
but
order
his
four
horses
and
have
them
turned
out
at
every
stage
as
he
came
up
instead
of
being
stopped
in
the
manner
he
then
was
and
he
strutted
and
stamped
about
the
station
as
if
he
would
put
a
stop
to
the
whole
line
his
vehemence
and
big
talk
operated
favourably
on
the
cockney
who
thinking
he
must
be
a
duke
or
some
great
man
began
to
consider
how
to
get
him
forwarded
it
being
only
a
thinly
populated
district
though
there
was
a
station
equal
to
any
mercantile
emergency
indeed
to
the
requirements
of
the
whole
county
he
ran
the
resources
of
the
immediate
neighbourhood
through
his
mind
and
at
length
was
obliged
to
admit
humbly
and
respectfully
that
he
really
was
afraid
martha
donkey
was
the
only
available
article
jack
fumed
and
bounced
at
the
very
mention
of
such
a
thing
vowing
that
it
was
a
downright
insult
to
propose
it
and
he
was
so
bumptious
that
the
who
had
nothing
to
gain
by
the
transaction
sought
the
privacy
of
the
electric
telegraph
office
and
left
him
to
vent
the
balance
of
his
wrath
upon
the
porters
of
course
they
could
do
nothing
more
than
the
king
of
their
little
colony
had
suggested
and
finding
there
was
no
help
for
it
spraggon
at
last
submitted
to
the
humiliation
and
set
off
to
follow
young
muggins
with
his
bag
on
the
donkey
in
his
best
worn
under
his
trousers
an
unpleasant
operation
to
any
one
but
especially
to
a
man
like
jack
who
preferred
wearing
his
tops
out
against
the
flaps
of
his
friends
saddles
rather
than
his
soles
by
walking
upon
them
however
necessity
said
yes
and
cocking
his
flat
hat
jauntily
on
his
head
he
stuck
a
cheroot
in
his
mouth
and
went
smoking
and
swaggering
on
looking
or
rather
squinting
bumptiously
at
everybody
he
met
as
much
as
to
say
suppose
i
walking
from
necessity
i
plenty
of
tin
the
third
cheroot
brought
jack
and
his
suite
within
sight
of
hanby
house
puffington
had
about
got
through
all
the
fuss
of
his
preparations
arranged
the
billets
of
the
guests
and
of
those
scarcely
less
important
personages
their
servants
allotted
the
stables
and
rehearsed
the
wines
when
a
chance
glance
through
the
gaily
furnished
window
discovered
jack
trudging
up
the
trimly
kept
avenue
that
nasty
spraggon
exclaimed
he
eyeing
jack
dragging
his
legs
along
adding
be
bound
to
say
he
never
think
of
wiping
his
filthy
feet
if
i
do
go
to
meet
him
so
saying
puffington
rushed
to
the
entrance
and
crowning
himself
with
a
white
advanced
cheerily
to
do
so
jack
who
was
more
used
to
shoulder
than
cordial
reception
squinted
and
stared
with
surprise
at
the
unwonted
warmth
so
different
to
their
last
interview
when
jack
was
fresh
out
of
his
in
the
brick
fields
but
not
being
easily
put
out
of
his
way
he
just
took
puff
as
puff
took
him
they
talked
of
scamperdale
and
they
talked
of
frostyface
and
the
number
of
foxes
he
had
killed
the
price
of
corn
and
the
difference
its
price
made
in
the
keep
of
hounds
and
horses
altogether
they
were
very
how
our
friend
sponge
asked
puffington
as
the
conversation
at
length
began
to
flag
he
nicely
replied
jack
adding
he
come
yet
that
i
seen
answered
puffington
adding
thought
perhaps
you
might
come
together
grunted
jack
comes
from
jawleyford
you
know
i
from
woodmansterne
go
and
see
if
he
come
observed
puffington
opening
a
door
in
the
into
which
he
had
manoeuvred
jack
communicating
with
the
courtyard
of
the
stable
are
his
horses
observed
puffington
as
leather
rode
through
the
great
gates
on
the
opposite
side
with
the
renowned
hunters
in
full
marching
order
fine
animals
they
are
said
jack
squinting
intently
at
them
are
that
replied
puffington
sponge
seems
a
very
pleasant
gentlemanly
man
observed
puffington
he
is
replied
jack
you
tell
me
can
you
inform
me
that
to
say
can
you
give
me
any
idea
hesitated
puffington
is
the
usual
practice
the
usual
course
the
usual
understanding
as
to
the
treatment
of
those
sort
of
gentlemen
the
best
of
everything
good
enough
for
them
replied
jack
adding
as
it
is
with
me
i
do
mean
in
the
way
of
eating
and
drinking
but
in
the
way
of
encouragement
in
the
way
of
a
present
you
know
adding
did
my
lord
do
seeing
jack
was
slow
at
comprehension
my
lord
him
well
replied
jack
adding
did
get
much
encouragement
from
him
that
the
worst
of
my
lord
observed
puffington
rather
coarse
rather
too
indifferent
to
public
opinion
in
a
case
of
this
sort
you
know
that
does
happen
every
day
or
perhaps
more
than
once
in
a
man
life
it
just
as
well
to
be
favourably
spoken
of
as
not
you
know
adding
as
he
looked
intently
at
jack
you
understand
me
jack
who
was
tolerably
quick
at
a
chance
now
began
to
see
how
things
were
and
to
fathom
puffington
mistake
his
ready
imagination
immediately
saw
there
might
be
something
made
of
it
so
he
prepared
to
keep
up
the
delusion
said
he
straddling
out
his
legs
clasping
his
hands
together
and
squinting
steadily
through
his
spectacles
to
try
and
see
by
puffington
countenance
how
much
he
would
stand
repeated
he
should
think
though
mind
it
mere
conjectur
on
my
part
that
you
could
offer
him
less
than
twenty
or
punds
or
say
from
that
to
thirty
continued
jack
seeing
that
puff
countenance
remained
complacent
under
the
rise
that
you
think
would
be
sufficient
asked
puff
adding
one
does
the
thing
at
all
you
know
it
as
well
to
do
it
handsomely
replied
jack
sticking
out
his
great
thick
lips
i
a
great
advocate
for
doing
things
handsomely
many
a
row
i
have
with
my
lord
for
thanking
fellows
and
saying
he
them
instead
of
giving
them
sixpence
or
a
shilling
but
really
i
should
say
if
you
were
to
give
him
forty
or
fifty
pund
say
a
fifty
pund
note
he
be
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
by
the
appearance
of
sponge
cantering
up
the
avenue
on
the
conspicuous
piebald
puffington
and
spraggon
greeted
him
as
he
alighted
at
the
door
sponge
was
quickly
followed
by
tom
washball
then
came
charley
slapp
and
lumpleg
and
captain
guano
came
in
a
gig
mutual
bows
and
bobs
and
shakes
of
the
hand
being
exchanged
amid
offers
of
before
dinner
from
the
host
the
guests
were
at
length
shown
to
their
respective
apartments
from
which
in
due
time
they
emerged
looking
like
so
many
bridegrooms
first
came
the
worthy
master
of
the
hounds
himself
in
his
scarlet
lined
with
white
satin
tom
washball
and
charley
slapp
also
sported
puff
uniform
while
captain
guano
who
was
proud
of
his
leg
sported
the
uniform
of
the
muffington
hunt
a
coat
lined
with
yellow
and
a
yellow
collar
white
shorts
with
gold
garters
and
black
silk
stockings
spraggon
had
been
obliged
to
put
up
with
lord
scamperdale
second
best
coat
his
lordship
having
taken
the
best
one
himself
but
it
was
passable
enough
by
candle
light
and
the
seediness
of
the
blue
cloth
was
relieved
by
a
velvet
collar
and
a
new
set
of
the
flat
hat
hunt
buttons
sponge
wore
a
plain
scarlet
with
a
crimson
velvet
collar
and
a
bright
fox
on
the
frosted
ground
of
a
gilt
button
with
tights
as
before
and
when
crane
arrived
he
was
found
to
be
attired
in
a
dress
composed
partly
of
puffington
and
partly
of
the
muggeridge
hunt
uniform
the
red
coat
of
the
former
surmounting
the
white
shorts
and
black
stockings
of
the
other
altogether
however
they
were
uncommonly
smart
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
appreciated
each
other
the
dinner
was
sumptuous
puff
of
course
was
in
the
chair
and
captain
guano
coming
last
into
the
room
and
being
very
fond
of
office
was
vice
when
men
run
to
the
science
of
gastronomy
they
generally
outstrip
the
ladies
in
the
art
of
for
they
admit
of
no
makeweight
or
merely
ornamental
dishes
but
concentrate
the
cook
energies
on
sterling
and
approved
dishes
everything
men
set
on
is
meant
to
be
eaten
above
all
men
are
not
too
fine
to
have
the
in
the
room
the
deficiency
of
hot
plates
proving
fatal
to
many
a
fine
feast
it
was
evident
that
puff
prided
himself
on
his
table
his
linen
was
the
finest
and
whitest
his
glass
the
most
elegant
and
transparent
his
plate
the
brightest
and
his
wines
the
most
costly
and
like
many
people
however
who
are
not
much
in
the
habit
of
he
was
anxious
and
fussy
too
intent
upon
making
people
comfortable
to
allow
of
their
being
so
and
too
anxious
to
get
victuals
and
drink
down
their
throats
to
allow
of
their
enjoying
either
he
not
only
produced
a
tremendous
assortment
of
wines
hock
sauterne
champagne
barsack
burgundy
but
descended
into
endless
varieties
of
sherries
and
madeiras
these
he
pressed
upon
people
always
insisting
that
the
last
sample
was
the
best
in
these
hospitable
exertions
puffington
was
ably
assisted
by
captain
guano
who
being
fond
of
wine
came
in
for
a
good
quantity
first
of
all
by
asking
everyone
to
take
wine
with
him
and
then
in
return
every
one
asking
him
to
do
the
same
with
them
the
present
absurd
system
was
not
then
in
vogue
the
great
captain
noisy
and
talkative
at
all
times
began
to
be
boisterous
almost
before
the
cloth
was
drawn
puffington
was
equally
promiscuous
with
his
wines
he
had
all
sorts
of
clarets
and
old
ports
the
party
did
not
seem
to
have
any
objection
to
spoil
their
digestions
for
the
next
day
and
took
whatever
he
produced
with
great
alacrity
lengthened
were
the
candle
examinations
solemn
the
sips
and
sounding
the
smacks
that
preceded
the
delivery
of
their
judgements
the
conversation
which
at
first
was
altogether
upon
wine
gradually
diverged
upon
sporting
and
they
presently
brewed
up
a
very
considerable
cry
foremost
among
the
noisy
ones
was
captain
guano
he
seemed
inclined
to
take
the
shine
out
of
everybody
if
they
could
but
find
a
good
fox
that
would
give
them
a
run
of
ten
miles
say
ten
miles
just
ten
miles
would
satisfy
him
say
from
barnesley
wold
to
chingforde
wood
or
from
carleburg
clump
to
wetherden
head
he
was
going
to
ride
his
famous
horse
the
finest
horse
that
ever
was
foaled
no
day
too
long
for
him
no
pace
too
great
for
him
no
fence
too
stiff
for
him
no
brook
too
broad
for
him
tom
washball
too
talked
as
if
wearing
a
red
coat
was
not
the
only
purpose
for
which
he
hunted
and
altogether
they
seemed
to
be
an
amazing
sporting
set
when
at
length
they
rose
to
go
to
bed
it
struck
each
man
as
he
followed
his
neighbour
upstairs
that
the
one
before
him
walked
very
crookedly
chapter
xxxviii
a
day
with
puffington
hounds
day
dawned
cheerfully
if
there
was
rather
more
sun
than
the
strict
rules
of
beckford
prescribe
still
sunshine
is
not
a
thing
to
quarrel
with
under
any
circumstances
certainly
not
for
a
gentleman
to
quarrel
with
who
wants
his
place
seen
to
advantage
on
the
occasion
of
a
meet
of
hounds
everything
at
hanby
house
was
in
order
all
the
stray
leaves
that
the
capricious
wintry
winds
still
kept
raising
from
unknown
quarters
and
whisking
about
the
trim
lawns
were
hunted
and
caught
while
a
heavy
roller
passed
over
the
kensington
gravel
pressing
out
the
hoof
and
wheelmarks
of
the
previous
day
the
servants
were
up
betimes
preparing
the
house
for
those
that
were
in
it
and
a
à
la
for
chance
customers
from
without
they
were
equally
busy
at
the
stable
although
bragg
did
profess
such
indifference
for
sponge
opinion
he
nevertheless
thought
it
might
perhaps
be
as
well
to
be
condescending
to
the
stranger
accordingly
he
ordered
his
whips
to
be
on
the
alert
to
tie
their
ties
and
put
on
their
boots
as
they
ought
to
be
and
to
hoist
their
caps
becomingly
on
the
appearance
of
our
friend
bragg
like
a
good
many
huntsmen
had
a
sort
of
tariff
of
politeness
that
he
indicated
by
the
manner
in
which
he
saluted
the
field
to
a
lord
he
made
a
sweep
of
his
cap
like
the
dome
of
paul
a
baronet
came
in
for
about
half
as
much
a
knight
to
a
quarter
bragg
had
also
a
sort
of
city
or
monetary
tariff
of
politeness
a
tariff
that
was
oftener
called
in
requisition
than
the
one
in
puffington
country
to
a
good
he
vouchsafed
as
much
cap
as
he
gave
to
a
lord
to
a
middling
he
gave
a
sort
of
move
that
might
either
pass
for
a
touch
of
the
cap
or
a
more
comfortable
adjustment
of
it
to
his
head
a
very
small
had
a
forefinger
to
the
peak
while
he
who
gave
nothing
at
all
got
a
good
stare
or
a
good
morning
or
something
of
that
sort
a
man
watching
the
arrival
of
the
field
could
see
who
gave
the
fives
who
the
fours
who
the
threes
who
the
twos
who
the
ones
and
who
were
the
great
o
but
to
our
day
with
puffington
hounds
our
friends
were
not
quite
so
brisk
in
the
morning
as
the
servants
and
parties
outside
puffington
told
upon
a
good
many
of
them
washball
had
a
headache
so
had
lumpleg
crane
was
seedy
and
captain
guano
was
in
great
request
there
was
a
splendid
breakfast
table
and
sideboard
looking
as
if
fortnum
and
mason
or
morel
had
opened
a
branch
establishment
at
hanby
house
though
the
staying
guests
could
not
do
much
for
the
good
things
set
out
they
were
not
wasted
for
the
place
was
fairly
taken
by
storm
shortly
before
the
advertised
hour
of
meeting
and
what
at
one
time
looked
like
a
most
extravagant
supply
at
another
seemed
likely
to
prove
a
deficiency
each
man
helped
himself
to
whatever
he
fancied
without
waiting
for
the
ceremony
of
an
invitation
in
the
usual
style
of
hospitality
a
few
minutes
before
eleven
a
rantaway
accompanied
by
a
slight
crack
of
a
whip
drew
the
seedy
and
satisfied
parties
to
the
oriel
window
to
see
bragg
pass
along
with
his
hounds
they
were
just
gliding
noiselessly
over
the
green
sward
bragg
rising
in
his
stirrups
as
spruce
as
a
with
his
thoroughbred
bay
gambolling
and
pawing
with
delight
at
the
frolic
of
the
hounds
some
clustering
around
him
others
shooting
forward
a
little
as
if
to
show
how
obediently
they
would
return
at
his
whistle
bragg
was
known
as
the
whistling
huntsman
and
was
a
great
man
for
telegraphing
and
signalizing
with
his
arms
boasting
that
he
could
make
hounds
so
handy
that
they
could
do
everything
except
pay
the
at
his
appearance
the
men
all
began
to
shuffle
to
the
passage
and
to
look
for
their
hats
and
whips
and
presently
there
was
a
great
outpouring
of
red
coats
upon
the
lawn
all
straddling
and
waddling
of
course
then
bragg
seeing
an
audience
with
a
slight
whistle
and
wave
of
his
right
arm
wheeled
his
forces
round
and
trotted
gaily
towards
where
our
guests
had
grouped
themselves
within
the
light
iron
railing
that
separated
the
smooth
slope
from
the
field
as
he
reined
in
his
horse
he
gave
his
cap
an
aerial
sweep
taking
off
perpendicularly
and
finishing
at
his
horse
ears
an
example
that
was
immediately
followed
by
the
whips
and
also
by

mister

rising
in
his
stirrups
with
a
gracious
smile
passed
a
very
polite
bow
along
the
line
a
fine
morning
bragg
observed
tom
washball
who
thought
it
knowing
to
talk
to
servants
sir
replied
bragg
with
a
slight
inclination
to
cap
more
than
desirable

he
raising
his

towards
the

who
having
vaulted
the
iron
hurdles
was
now
among

here
our
old
rummager
i

repeated
he
laying
his
whip
on
the
head
of
a
black
and
white
hound
somewhat
down
in
the
toes
and
looking
as
if
he
was
about
done
me

replied
bragg
leaning
over
his
horse
shoulder
and
whispering
into
jack
ear
me
sir
but
that
sir
if
you
please

what
asked
jack
squinting
through
his
great

up
into

replied
jack
squinting
if
possible
more
frightfully
than
before
that
the
hound
i
offered
to

observed
puffington
seeing
the
movement
and
coming
up
to
where
jack
stood
the

i
offered
to
scamperdale
repeated
he
taking
the
old
dog
head
between
his
hands
no
better
hound
in
the
world
than
this
continued
he
patting
and
smoothing
him
no
better
hound
either
added
he
rubbing
the
dog
sides
with
his
whip
is
he
bred
asked
jack
who
knew
the
hound
pedigree
better
than
he
did
his
own
i
got
him
from
reynard
no
i
mean
from
downeybird
the
duke
you
know
but
he
was
bred

of

by
the
rutland
rallywood
out
of

but
to
make
a
long
story
short
he
lineally
descended
from
the
beaufort
justice
exclaimed
jack
hardly
able
to
contain
himself
undeniable
blood
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
replied
puffington
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
for
you
understand
these
things
no
man
better
and
i
confess
i
a
warm
side
to
that
beaufort

wonder
at
it
replied
jack
laughing
his
waistcoat
strings
off
great
warde
continued
puffington
was
justly
partial
to
his
own
sort
had
never
any
objection
to
breeding
from
the
beaufort
justice
nor
nobody
else
that
knew
what
he
was
about
replied
jack
turning
away
to
conceal
his
laughter
should
be
moving
i
think
sir
observed
bragg
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
the
conversation

be

repeated
he
with
a
rap
of
his
forefinger
against
his

he
looking
at
his
gold
watch
and
shutting
it
against
his

would
have
said

the
move
of
the

caused
a
rush
of
gentlemen
to
their
horses
and
there
was
the
usual
scramblings
up
and
fidgetings
and
funkings
and
and
drawing
of
girths
and
taking
up
of
curbs

lengthening

the

tom

shot
across

over

so

almost
as
soon
as

into

their
brows

there
was
not

hitting
off

much
in

manner
of

crossed
the

of

before
he
had
got
his
circle
and
away
the

dashed
at
a
pace
and
with
a
cry
that
looked
very
like
killing
bragg
was
in
ecstasies
and
rode
in
a
manner
very
contrary
to
his
wont
all
again
was
life
energy
and
action
and
even
some
who
hoped
there
was
an
end
of
the
thing
and
that
they
might
go
home
and
say
as
usual
they
had
had
a
very
good
run
but
not
killed
were
induced
to
proceed
away
they
all
went
as
before
at
the
end
of
eighteen
minutes
more
the
hounds
ran
into
their
fox
in
the
little
green
valley
below

stood
glorying
in
the
splendour
of

all
had
a
direct
interest
in
making
it
out
as
good
as
possible

was
quite
ready
to
appropriate

abuse

it
was
on
the
present
occasion
the
men
of
the
hunt
charley
slapp
lumpleg
guano
crane
washball
and
others
lauded
and
magnified
it
into
something
magnificent
while
fossick
fyle
wake
blossomnose
and
others
of
the
hat
hunt
pronounced
it
a
niceish
thing
a
pretty
burst
and
vosper
who
had
hunted
for
seasons
without
ever
subscribing
one
farthing
to
hounds
always
declaring
that
each
season
was
last
or
that
he
was
going
to
confine
himself
entirely
to
some
other
pack
said
it
was
nothing
to
make
a
row
about
that
he
had
seen
fifty
better
things
with
the
tinglebury
harriers
and
never
a
word
said
said
sponge
to
spraggon
between
the
whiffs
of
a
cigar
as
they
rode
together
was
so
bad
was
it
no
squinted
jack
good
for
puff
at
least
adding
question
he
had
a
better
this
season
we
are
in
luck
observed
tom
washball
riding
up
and
joining
them
are
in
luck
to
have
a
satisfactory
thing
with
you
great
connoisseurs
out
pretty
thing
enough
replied
jack
thing
enough
i
do
mean
to
say
it
equal
to
many
we
had
this
season
replied
washball
like
the
boughton
hill
day
nor
yet
the
hembury
forest
one
but
still
considering
the
meet
and
the
state
of
the
country
the
country
good
enough
growled
jack
who
hated
washball
adding
good
fox
makes
any
country
good
with
which
observation
he
sidled
up
to
sponge
leaving
washball
in
the
middle
of
the
road
reminds
me
said
jack
to
sponge
the
crittur
wants
his
run
puffed
and
he
thinks
you
can
do
it
exclaimed
sponge
put
that
in
his
head
you
see
exclaimed
jack
first
time
you
came
out
with
our
hounds
at
dundleton
tower
you
remember
or
rather
the
first
time
we
saw
you
when
your
horse
ran
away
with
you
somebody
fyle
i
think
it
was
said
you
were
a
literary
cove
and
puff
catchin
at
the
idea
has
never
been
able
to
get
rid
of
it
since
and
the
fact
is
he
like
to
be
flattered
he
be
uncommonly
pleased
if
you
were
to
soft
sawder
him
handsomely
exclaimed
sponge
your
heart
man
i
ca
write
anything
nothing
fit
to
print
at
least
fiddle
retorted
spraggon

write
as
well
as
any
other
man
see
what
lots
of
fellows
write
and
nobody
ever
finds
fault
the
spellin
bothers
one
replied
sponge
with
a
shake
of
his
elbow
and
body
as
if
the
idea
was
quite
out
of
the
question
the
spellin
muttered
jack
can
always
borrow
a
dictionary
or
let
the
man
of
the
paper
the
editor
as
they
call
him
smooth
out
the
spellin
you
say
at
the
end
of
your
letter
that
your
hands
are
cold
or
your
hand
aches
with
holdin
a
pullin
horse
and
you
thank
him
to
correct
any
inadvertencies
you
need
call
them
errors
you
know
where
the
use
of
it
exclaimed
sponge
do
us
no
good
you
know
praisin
puff
pack
or
himself
or
anything
about
him
just
the
point
said
jack
just
the
point
i
can
make
it
answer
both
our
purposes
said
he
with
a
nudge
of
the
elbow
and
an
squint
of
his
eyes
that
another
matter
replied
our
friend
we
can
turn
the
thing
to
account
well
and
good
i
your
man
for
a
shy
turn
it
to
account
rejoined
jack
turn
it
to
account
at
least
can
but
then
you
must
do
it
he
would
take
it
as
any
compliment
from
me
it
the
stranger
that
sees
all
things
in
their
true
lights
d
understand
asked
he
eagerly
twig
replied
sponge
write
the
account
continued
jack
i
manage
the
rest
must
help
me
observed
sponge
replied
jack
do
it
together
and
go
halves
in
the
plunder
mused
sponge
said
he
to
himself
what
will
you
give
me
for
my
half
asked
he
you
exclaimed
jack
brightening
up
you
let
me
see
continued
he
pretending
to
consider
rich
puff
a
liberal
fellow
puff
a
conceited
beggar
mix
it
strong
said
jack
give
you
ten
pounds
it
twelve
replied
sponge
after
a
pause
if
jack
had
said
twelve
sponge
would
have
asked
fourteen
said
jack
with
a
shake
of
the
head
really
is
with
worth
the
money
the
two
then
rode
on
in
silence
for
some
little
distance
tell
you
what
i
do
said
jack
spurring
his
horse
and
trotting
up
the
space
that
the
other
had
now
shot
ahead
split
the
difference
with
you
give
me
the
said
sponge
holding
out
his
hand
for
earnest
i
have
a
sov
upon
me
replied
jack
honour
bright
i
do
what
i
say
me
eleven
golden
sovereigns
for
my
chance
repeated
sponge
slowly
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
golden
sovereigns
for
your
chance
repeated
jack
replied
sponge
repeated
jack
jog
on
and
do
it
at
once
while
the
thing
fresh
in
our
minds
said
jack
working
his
horse
into
a
trot
sponge
did
the
same
and
the
of
orlantire
parkwall
favouring
their
design
they
increased
the
trot
to
a
canter
they
soon
passed
the
park
bounds
and
entering
upon
one
of
those
rarities
an
unenclosed
common
angled
its
limits
so
as
to
escape
the
and
turning
up
farningham
green
lane
came
out
upon
the
kingsworth
and
swillingford
turnpike
within
sight
of
hanby

up
and
walk
the
horses
gently
in
observed
sponge
reining
his
in
i
was
only
wantin
to
get
home
before
the
rest
observed
jack
pulling
up
too
they
then
proceeded
more
leisurely
together
better
get
into
one
of
our
bedrooms
to
do
it
observed
jack
as
they
passed
the
lodge
so
replied
sponge
adding

say
we
shall
want
all
the
quiet
we
can
get
no

jack
thing
simple
enough

such
a

said
sponge
riding
into
the
and
resigning
his
steed
to
the
care
of
his
groom
illustration
jack
did
the
same
by
sponge
other
horse
which
he
had
been
riding
and
in
reply
to
leather
inquiry
who
stood
with
his
right
hand
ready
as
if
to
shake
hands
with
him
the
horse
had
carried
him
replied
ill
and
stamped
away
without
giving
him
anything

muttered
leather
as
he
led
the
horse
away
come
exclaimed
jack
to
sponge
let
get
in
before
any
of
those
bothersome
fellows
come
adding
as
he
dived
into
a
passage
show
you
the
back
way
after
passing
a
scullery
a
and
a
spacious
upon
a
table
in
which
stood
the
perpetual
and
a
green
baize
door
let
them
into
the
regions
of
upper
service
and
passing
the
dashed
carpets
of
the
housekeeper
room
and
butler
pantry
a
red
baize
door
let
them
into
the
of
the
front
entrance
having
deposited
their
hats
and
whips
they
bounded
up
the
richly
carpeted
staircase
to
their
rooms
hanby
house
as
we
have
already
said
was
splendidly
furnished
all
the
grandeur
did
not
run
to
the
entertaining
rooms
but
each
particular
apartment
from
the
state
bedroom
down
to
the
smallest
bachelor
snuggery
was
replete
with
elegance
and
comfort
like
many
houses
however
the
bedrooms
possessed
every
imaginable
luxury
except
and
pens
that
would
write
in
sponge
room
for
instance
there
were
and
a

hot
and
cold
baths
adjoining

without

every
imaginable
requirement
of
correspondence
except
a
pen
that
would
write
there
pens
indeed
there
almost
always
are
but
they
were
miserable
apologies
of
things
some
were
mere
sort
of
of
pens
while
others
were
great
clumsy
sort
of
things
clotted
up
to
the
hocks
with
ink
or
split
all
the
way
through
vexatious
apologies
that
throw
a
person
over
just
at
the
critical
moment
when
he
has
got
his
sheet
prepared
and
his
ideas
all
ready
to
pour
upon
paper
then
splut
splut
splutter
goes
the
pen
and
away
goes
the
train
of
thought
bold
is
the
man
who
undertakes
to
write
his
letters
in
his
bedroom
with
pens
but
to
our
friends
jack
and
sponge
slept
next
door
to
each
other
sponge
as
we
have
already
said
occupying
the
with
its
bedstead
carved
and
panelled
sides
and
elegant
chintz
curtains
lined
with
pink
and
massive
tassels
while
jack
occupied
the
which
was
the
state
bedroom
in
miniature
only
a
good
deal
more
comfortable
the
rooms
communicated
with
double
doors
and
our
friends
very
soon
effected
a
passage
you
any
asked
jack
waddling
in
in
his
slippers
after
having
sucked
off
his
tops
without
the
aid
of
a
some
in
my
jacket
pocket
replied
sponge
nodding
to
where
it
hung
in
the
wardrobe
it
wo
do
to
smoke
here
will
it
asked
he
not
inquired
jack
a
fine
room
replied
sponge
looking
around
fine
be
hanged
replied
jack
adding
as
he
made
for
the
jacket
place
too
fine
for
smokin
in
having
helped
himself
to
one
of
the
best
cigars
and
lighted
it
jack
composed
himself
in
an
easy
spring
stuffed
chair
while
sponge
fussed
about
among
the
writing
implements
watering
and
stirring
up
the
clotted
ink
and
denouncing
each
pen
in
succession
as
he
gave
it
the
initiatory
trial
in
writing
the
word
the
pens
exclaimed
he
throwing
the
last
bright
crisp
yellow
thing
from
him
in
disgust
not
one
among
that
can
go
all
stumped
up
you
a
penknife
asked
jack
taking
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
i
replied
sponge
a
razor
then
said
jack
who
was
good
at
an
expedient
take
one
of
yours
said
sponge
going
into
the
for
one
it
but
you
rather
too
sharp
exclaimed
jack
with
a
shake
of
his
head
more
than
your
razor
be
when
i
done
with
it
replied
sponge
having
at
length
with
the
aid
of
jack
razor
succeeded
in
getting
a
pen
that
would
write
sponge
selected
a
sheet
of
best
satin
paper
and
taking
a
chair
placed
himself
at
the
table
in
an
attitude
for
writing
dipping
the
fine
yellow
pen
in
the
ink
he
looked
in
jack
face
for
an
idea
jack
who
had
now
got
well
advanced
in
the
cigar
sat
squinting
through
his
spectacles
at
our
scribe
though
apparently
looking
at
the
top
of
the
bed
said
sponge
with
a
look
of
inquiry
replied
jack
in
a
tone
of
indifference
shall
i
begin
asked
sponge
twirling
the
pen
between
his
fingers
and
spluttering
the
ink
over
the
paper
replied
jack
oh
begin
just
as
you
usually
begin
a
letter
asked
sponge
so
replied
jack
would
you
think
i
do
know
replied
sponge
try
your
hand
added
he
holding
out
the
pen
i
busy
just
now
you
see
said
he
pointing
to
his
cigar
that
horse
of
yours
jack
had
ridden
the
redoubtable
chestnut
who
had
gone
very
well
in
the
company
of
hercules
pulled
so
confoundedly
that
i
almost
lost
the
use
of
my
fingers
continued
he
working
away
as
if
he
had
got
the
cramp
in
both
hands
i
prompt
you
added
he
prompt
you
do
you
begin
then
asked
sponge
exclaimed
jack
taking
the
cigar
from
his
lips
repeated
he
i
begin
directly
did
know
you
were
ready
jack
then
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
sticking
out
his
little
bandy
legs
turned
the
whites
of
his
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
as
if
lost
in
meditation
said
he
after
a
pause
this
splendid
pack
had
a
stunning
run
we
must
put
pack
first
observed
sponge
writing
the
words
puffington
hounds
at
the
top
of
the
paper
said
he
writing
on
stunning
pack
had
a
splendid
run
not
stunning
growled
jack
pack
this
splendid
pack
had
a
stunning
run
exclaimed
sponge
writing
it
down
said
he
looking
up
got
it
stunning
pack
had
a
splendid
run
repeated
jack
squinting
away
at
the
ceiling
thought
you
said
pack
observed
sponge
i
did
replied
jack
said
stunning
just
now
rejoined
he
that
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue
said
jack
splendid
pack
had
a
stunning
run
repeated
jack
appealing
again
to
his
cigar
for
inspiration
then
said
he
after
a
pause
just
go
on
as
usual
you
know
continued
he
with
a
flourish
of
his
great
red
hand
usual
exclaimed
sponge
do
one
pen
goes
of
itself
no
replied
jack
knocking
the
ashes
off
his
cigar
on
to
the
tapestry
carpet
no
not
exactly
but
these
things
you
know
are
a
good
deal
matter
of
course
just
describe
what
you
saw
you
know
and
butter
puff
well
that
the
main
point
you
forget
replied
sponge
do
know
the
country
i
do
know
the
people
i
do
know
anything
at
all
about
the
run
i
never
once
looked
at
the
hounds
nothin
replied
jack
be
plenty
like
you
in
that
respect
however
continued
he
gathering
himself
up
in
his
chair
as
if
for
an
effort
can
say
let
me
see
what
you
can
say
you
can
say
this
splendid
pack
had
a
stunning
run
from
hollyburn
hanger
the
property
of
its
truly
popular
master
puffington
or
stop
said
jack
checking
himself
the
property
of
its
truly
popular
and
sporting
master
mr
puffington
the
cover
just
as
much
mine
as
it
his
observed
jack
belongs
to
old
sir
timothy
tensthemain
who
vegetating
at
but
puff
says
he
buy
it
when
it
comes
to
the
hammer
so
we
flatter
him
by
considering
it
his
already
just
as
we
flatter
him
by
calling
him
a
sportsman
added
jack
with
a
sneer
just
as
much
taste
for
the
thing
as
a
cow
said
sponge
looking
up
got
truly
popular
and
sporting
master
puffington
adding
we
better
say
something
about
the
meet
and
the
grand
spread
here
before
we
begin
with
the
run
replied
jack
after
a
whiff
and
another
adjustment
of
the
end
of
his
cigar
that
a
splendid
field
of
sportsmen
splendid
field
of
sportsmen
wrote
sponge
among
whom
we
recognized
several
distinguished
strangers
and
members
of
lord
scamperdale
hunt
that
means
you
and
i
observed
jack
of
lord
scamperdale
hunt
that
means
you
and
i
read
sponge
as
he
wrote
it
you
not
to
put
in
that
you
not
to
write
that
means
you
and
i
my
man
observed
jack
i
thought
that
was
part
of
the
sentence
replied
sponge
no
said
jack
meant
to
say
that
you
and
i
were
the
distinguished
strangers
and
members
of
lord
scamperdale
hunt
but
that
between
ourselves
you
know
said
sponge
i
strike
that
out
running
his
pen
through
the
words
means
you
and
i
get
on
said
he
appealing
to
jack
adding
a
deal
to
do
yet
said
jack
after
partaking
of
the
profuse
and
splendid
hospitality
of
hanby
house
they
proceeded
at
once
to
hollyburn
hanger
where
a
fine
seasoned
fox
though
some
said
he
was
a
bag
one
they
exclaimed
sponge
adding
i
thought
he
went
away
rather
queerly
it
was
only
old
bung
the
brewer
who
runs
down
every
run
he
ride
never
mind
replied
sponge
make
the
best
of
it
whatever
it
was
writing
away
as
he
spoke
and
repeating
the
words
one
as
he
penned
them
broke
away
continued
jack
in
view
of
the
whole
field
added
sponge
so
assented
jack
every
hound
scoring
to
cry
and
making
the
the
the
what
d
call
the
thing
asked
jack
suggested
sponge
replied
jack
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
dale
tried
sponge
again
exclaimed
jack
hitting
it
off
himself
makin
the
welkin
ring
with
their
melody
makin
the
welkin
ring
with
their

repeated
he
with
exultation
observed
sponge
as
he
wrote
it
to
littlelegs
said
jack
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
make
a
grand
thing
of
it
observed
sponge

will
replied
jack
adding
we
had
but
a
book

some
lines
here

a
book

no
sort
with
you
that

he
replied
sponge
thoughtfully

observed
jack
with
a
shake
of
the
head
stay
said
he
are
some
books
over
yonder
pointing
to
the
top
of
an
indian
cabinet
and
squinting
in
a
totally
different
direction
see
what
they
are
added
he
rising
and
stumping
away
to
where
they
stood
promessi
read
he
off
the
back
of
one
can
that
mean
ah
latin
said
he
opening
the
volume
à
ma
read
he
off
the
back
of
another
sounds
like
racin
observed
he
opening
the
volume
latin
too
said
he
returning
it
never
mind
we
sugar
puff
milk
as
bragg
would
say
without
so
saying
spraggon
stumped
back
to
his
now
said
he
seating
himself
comfortably
in
it
see
where
did
we
go
first
he
broke
at
the
lower
end
of
the
cover
and
crossing
the
brook
made
straight
for
fleecyhaugh
water
meadows
over
which
you
may
say
there
always
a
ravishing
scent
you
got
that
asked
jack
after
what
he
thought
a
sufficient
lapse
of
time
for
writing
it
ravishing
scent
repeated
sponge
as
he
wrote
the
words
good
said
jack
smoking
and
considering
from
there
continued
he
he
made
a
bit
of
a
bend
as
if
inclining
for
the
plantations
at
winstead
but
changing
his
mind
he
faced
the
rising
ground
and
crossing
over
nearly
the
highest
part
of
shillington
hill
made
direct
for
the
little
village
of
berrington
roothings
below
exclaimed
sponge
have
got
half
that
i
only
got
to
the
plantations
at
winstead
sponge
made
play
with
his
pen
and
presently
held
it
up
in
token
of
being
done
pondered
jack
was
a
check
there
say
continued
he
addressing
himself
to
sponge
here
the
hounds
came
to
a
check
the
hounds
came
to
a
check
wrote
sponge
we
say
anything
about
distance
asked
he
we
may
as
well
replied
jack
shall
have
to
stretch
it
though
a
bit
see
continued
he
the
cover
to
berrington
roothings
over
by
shillington
hill
and
fleecyhaugh
water
meadows
will
be
say
two
miles
and
a
half
or
three
miles
at
the
most
call
it
four
well
four
miles
say
four
miles
in
twelve
minutes
twenty
miles
an
hour
too
quick
four
miles
in
fifteen
minutes
sixteen
miles
an
hour
no
i
think
it
be
safer
to
lump
the
distance
at
the
end
and
put
in
a
place
or
two
that
nobody
knows
the
name
of
for
the
convenience
of
those
who
were
not
out
those
who
out
will
blab
wo
they
asked
sponge
to
each
other
replied
jack
all
stand
up
for
the
truth
of
it
as
against
strangers
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
the
puddin
for
those
that
were
out
then
observed
sponge
looking
at
his
paper
to
report
progress
got
the
hounds
to
a
check
here
the
hounds
came
to
a
check
read
he
now
then
said
jack
in
a
tone
of
disgust
must
say
summut
handsome
of
bragg
and
of
all
conceited
animals
under
the
sun
he
certainly
is
the
most
conceited
i
never
saw
such
a
man
how
that
unfortunate
infatuated
master
of
his
keeps
him
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
faith
bragg
the
continued
jack
who
now
began
to
foam
at
the
mouth
laughs
at
old
puff
to
his
face
yet
it
wonderful
the
influence
bragg
has
over
him
i
really
believe
he
has
talked
puff
into
believing
that
there
not
such
another
huntsman
under
the
sun
and
really
he
as
great
a
muff
as
ever
walked
he
can
just
dress
the
character
and
that
all
so
saying
jack
wiped
his
mouth
on
the
sleeve
of
his
red
coat
preparatory
to
displaying
bragg
upon
paper
now
we
are
at
fault
said
jack
motioning
sponge
to
resume
are
at
fault
now
say
but
bragg
who
had
ridden
gallantly
on
his
favourite
bay
as
fine
an
animal
as
ever
went
though
somewhat
past
mark
of
mouth
he
a
good
horse
at
least
observed
jack
adding
sold
puff
him
he
was
one
of
old
sugarlip
meaning
lord
scamperdale
to
be
a
good
then
replied
sponge
with
a
wink
adding
wonder
if
he
like
to
buy
any
more
talk
about
that
after
replied
jack
present
let
us
get
on
with
our
run
said
sponge
got
it
bragg
who
had
ridden
gallantly
on
his
favourite
bay
as
fine
an
animal
as
ever
went
though
somewhat
past
mark
of
mouth
was
well
up
with
his
hounds
continued
jack
and
with
a
gently
rantipole
and
a
single
wave
of
his
arm
proceeded
to
make
one
of
those
scientific
casts
for
which
this
eminent
huntsman
is
so
justly
celebrated
justly
repeated
jack
spitting
on
the
carpet
with
a
hawk
of
disgust
conceited
never
made
a
cast
worth
a
copper
or
rode
a
yard
but
when
he
thought
somebody
was
looking
at
him
got
it
said
sponge
who
had
plied
his
pen
to
good
purpose
celebrated
repeated
jack
with
a
snort
then
say
hitting
off
the
scent
like
a
workman
big
h
you
know
for
a
fresh
sentence
they
went
away
again
at
score
and
passing
by
moorlinch
farm
buildings
and
threading
the
strip
of
plantation
by
bexley
burn
he
crossed
silverbury
green
leaving
longford
hutch
to
the
right
and
passing
straight
on
by
the
gibbet
at
harpen
those
are
all
bits
of
places
observed
jack
none
but
the
country
folks
know
indeed
i
should
have
known
them
but
for
shootin
over
them
when
old
bloss
lived
at
the
green
well
now
have
you
got
all
that
asked
he
gibbet
at
harpen
read
sponge
as
he
wrote
it
here
then
the
gallant
pack
breaking
from
scent
to
view
continued
jack
speaking
slowly
ran
into
their
fox
in
the
open
close
upon
mountnessing
wood
evidently
his
point
from
the
first
and
into
which
a
few
more
strides
would
have
carried
him
it
was
as
fine
a
run
as
ever
was
seen
and
the
hunting
of
the
hounds
was
the
admiration
of
all
who
saw
it
the
distance
could
have
been
less
than
than
what
shall
we
say
asked
jack
twelve
miles
as
the
crow
flies
suggested
sponge
said
jack
that
would
be
too
much
say
ten
adding
will
be
four
miles
more
than
it
was
mind
said
sponge
as
he
wrote
it
like
good
measure
with
runs
as
well
as
ribbons
we
must
butter
old
puff
observed
spraggon
can
we
say
for
him
asked
sponge
he
never
went
off
the
road
by
jove
said
jack
spoil
all
if
you
do
that
better
leave
it
alone
altogether
than
do
that
say
the
justly
popular
owner
of
this
most
celebrated
pack
though
riding
good
fourteen
stone
he
rides
far
more
observed
jack
least
sixteen
but
it
please
him
to
make
out
that
he
ride
fourteen
led
the
welters
on
his
famous
chestnut
horse
tappey
lappey
shall
we
say
about
the
rest
asked
sponge
slapp
guano
and
all
those
illustration
jack
and
sponge
write
an
article
for
the
swillingford
paper
say
nothin
replied
jack
nothin
to
do
with
nobody
but
puff
and
we
could
mention
them
without
bringin
in
our
flat
hat
men
too
blossomnose
fyle
fossick
and
so
on
besides
it
would
spoil
all
to
say
that
guano
was
up
people
would
say
directly
it
could
have
been
much
of
a
run
if
guano
was
there
you
might
finish
off
observed
jack
after
a
pause
saying
that
after
this
truly
brilliant
affair
puffington
like
a
thorough
sportsman
and
one
who
never
trashes
his
hounds
unnecessarily
unlike
some
masters
you
may
say
who
never
know
when
to
leave
off
that
will
be
a
hit
at
old
scamp
observed
jack
with
a
frightful
squint
returned
to
hanby
house
where
a
distinguished
party
of
sportsmen
or
say
a
distinguished
party
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
that
please
the
ass
more
a
large
party
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
were
partaking
of
his
his
what
shall
we
call
it
said
sponge
no
summut
genteel
his
his
his
splendid
hospitality
concluded
jack
waving
his
arm
triumphantly
over
his
head
work
authorship
exclaimed
sponge
as
he
finished
writing
and
threw
down
the
pen
i
do
know
replied
jack
adding
could
go
on
for
an
hour
that
all
very
well
replied
sponge
you
squatting
comfortably
in
your
but
consider
me
toiling
with
my
pen
bothered
with
the
writing
and
craning
at
the
spelling
mind
we
done
it
replied
jack
adding
be
as
pleased
as
punch
we
polished
him
off
uncommon
that
just
the
sort
of
account
to
tickle
the
beggar
he
go
riding
about
the
country
showing
it
to
everybody
and
wondering
who
wrote
it
what
shall
we
send
it
to
the
or
what
asked
sponge
magazine
no
replied
jack
be
out
till
next
year
quick
the
word
in
these
railway
times
send
it
to
a
newspaper
or
one
of
the
swillingford
papers
either
of
them
would
be
glad
to
put
it
in
hope
they
be
able
to
read
it
observed
sponge
looking
at
the
blotched
and
scrawled
manuscript
them
for
that
replied
jack
adding
there
any
word
that
bothers
them
they
nothing
to
do
but
look
in
the
dictionary
these
folks
all
have
dictionaries
wonderful
fellows
for
spellin
just
then
a
little
buttony
page
in
green
and
gold
came
in
to
ask
if
there
were
any
letters
for
the
post
and
our
friends
hastily
made
up
their
packet
directing
it
to
the
editor
of
the
swillingford
to
glory
and
freeman
friend
words
that
in
the
hurried
style
of
penmanship
looked
very
like
to
grog
and
friend
chapter
xl
a
literary
bloomer
time
was
when
the
independent
borough
of
swillingford
supported
two
newspapers
or
rather
two
editors
the
editor
of
the
and
the
editor
of
the
guide
to
but
those
were
stirring
days
when
politics
ran
high
and
votes
and
corn
commanded
good
prices
the
papers
were
never
very
prosperous
concerns
as
may
be
supposed
when
we
say
that
the
circulation
of
the
former
at
its
best
time
was
barely
seven
hundred
while
that
of
the
latter
never
exceeded
a
thousand
they
were
both
started
at
the
reform
times
when
the
reduction
of
the
brought
so
many
aspiring
candidates
for
literary
fame
into
the
field
and
for
a
time
they
were
conducted
with
all
the
bitter
hostility
that
a
contracted
neighbourhood
and
a
constant
crossing
by
the
editors
of
each
other
path
could
engender
the
competition
too
for
advertisements
was
keen
and
the
editors
were
continually
taunting
each
other
with
taking
them
for
the
duty
alone
æneas
was
the
editor
of
the
and
felix
grimes
that
of
the
to
we
need
hardly
say
was
a
scotsman
a
big
sawney
formidable
in
as
he
called
his
trousers
and
terrific
in
kilts
while
grimes
was
a
native
of
swillingford
an
and
parish
clerk
and
now
an
auctioneer
a
hatter
a
dyer
and
bleacher
a
to
which
the
wits
said
when
he
set
up
his
paper
he
added
the
trade
of
at
first
the
rival
editors
carried
on
a
to
the
knife
sort
of
contest
with
one
another
each
denouncing
his
adversary
in
terms
of
the
most
unmeasured
severity
in
this
they
were
warmly
supported
by
a
select
knot
of
admirers
to
whom
they
read
their
weekly
effusions
at
their
respective
of
call
the
evening
before
publication
gradually
the
fire
of
bitterness
began
to
pale
and
the
excitement
of
friends
to
die
out
presently
put
forth
a
signal
of
distress
to
accommodate
large
and
influential
number
of
its
subscribers
and
patrons
he
determined
to
publish
on
a
tuesday
instead
of
on
a
saturday
as
heretofore
whereupon
grimes
who
had
never
been
able
to
fill
a
single
sheet
properly
now
doubled
his
paper
lowered
his
charge
for
advertisements
and
hinted
at
his
intention
of
publishing
an
occasional
supplement
however
exciting
it
may
be
for
a
time
parties
soon
tire
of
carrying
on
a
losing
game
for
the
mere
sake
of
abusing
each
other
and
æneas
not
being
behind
the
generality
of
his
countrymen
in
and
shrewdness
of
intellect
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
no
use
doing
so
in
this
case
especially
as
the
few
remaining
friends
who
still
applauded
would
be
very
sorry
to
subscribe
anything
towards
his
losses
he
therefore
very
quietly
negotiated
the
sale
of
his
paper
to
the
rival
editor
and
having
concluded
a
satisfactory
bargain
he
placed
the
bulk
of
his
property
in
the
poke
of
his
plaid
and
walked
out
of
swillingford
just
as
if
bent
on
taking
the
air
leaving
grimes
in
undisputed
possession
of
both
papers
who
forthwith
commenced
leading
both
whig
and
tory
mind
the
one
on
the
tuesday
the
other
on
the
saturday
the
pot
and
pipe
companions
of
course
saw
how
things
were
but
the
majority
of
the
readers
living
in
the
country
just
continued
to
pin
their
faith
to
the
printed
declarations
of
their
oracles
while
grimes
kept
up
the
delusion
of
sincerity
by
every
now
and
then
fulminating
a
tremendous
denunciation
against
his
trimming
vacillating
inconsistent
opponent
on
the
tuesday
and
then
retaliating
with
equal
vigour
upon
himself
on
the
saturday
he
wrote
his
own
both
whig
and
tory
the
arguments
of
one
side
pointing
out
answers
for
the
other
sometimes
he
led
the
way
for
a
triumphant
refutal
while
the
general
tone
of
the
articles
was
quite
of
the
a
ministry
style
indeed
grimes
strutted
and
swaggered
as
if
the
fate
of
the
nation
rested
with
him
the
papers
themselves
were
not
very
concerns
the
paragraphs
the
staring
type
the
catching
advertisements
forming
a
curious
contrast
to
the
close
packing
of
the
percha
company
female
pills
cough
lozenges
and
the
of
medicine
all
with
staring
woodcuts
and
royal
arms
occupied
conspicuous
places
in
every
paper
a
new
advertisement
was
a
novelty
however
the
two
papers
answered
a
great
deal
better
than
either
did
singly
and
any
lack
of
matter
was
easily
supplied
from
the
magazines
and
new
books
in
this
department
indeed
in
the
department
of
elegant
light
literature
generally
grimes
was
ably
assisted
by
his
eldest
daughter
lucy
a
young
lady
of
a
certain
age
say
liberal
thirty
an
ardent
bloomer
with
a
considerable
taste
for
sentimental
poetry
with
which
she
generally
filled
the
poet
corner
this
assistance
enabled
grimes
to
look
after
his
auctioneering
bleaching
and
concerns
and
it
so
happened
that
when
the
foregoing
run
arrived
at
the
office
he
having
seen
the
next
paper
ready
for
press
had
gone
to
vosper
some
ten
miles
off
to
paper
his
consequently
the
duties
of
deciding
upon
its
publication
devolved
on
the
bloomer
now
she
was
a
most
refined
puritanical
young
woman
full
of
sentiment
and
elegance
with
a
strong
objection
to
what
she
considered
the
inhumanities
of
the
chase
at
first
she
was
for
rejecting
the
article
altogether
and
had
it
been
a
run
with
the
tinglebury
harriers
or
even
we
believe
with
lord
scamperdale
hounds
she
would
have
consigned
it
to
the
box
but
seeing
it
was
with
puffington
hounds
whose
house
they
had
papered
and
who
advertised
with
them
she
condescended
to
read
it
and
though
her
delicacy
was
shocked
at
encountering
the
word
at
the
outset
and
also
at
the
term
scent
farther
on
she
nevertheless
sent
the
manuscript
to
the
compositors
after
making
such
alterations
and
corrections
as
she
thought
would
fit
it
for
eyes
polite
the
consequence
was
that
the
article
appeared
in
the
following
form
though
whether
all
the
absurdities
were
owing
to
miss
lucy
corrections
or
the
carelessness
of
the
writer
or
the
printers
had
anything
to
do
with
it
we
are
not
able
to
say
the
errors
some
of
them
arising
from
the
mere
alteration
or
substitution
of
a
letter
will
strike
a
sporting
more
than
a
general
reader
thus
it
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
third
sheet
of
the
splendid
run
with
puffington
hounds
this
splendid
pack
had
a
superb
run
from
hollyburn
hanger
the
property
of
its
truly
popular
and
sporting
owner
puffington
a
splendid
field
of
sportsmen
among
whom
we
recognized
several
distinguished
strangers
and
members
of
lord
scamperdale
hunt
were
present
after
partaking
of
the
profuse
and
splendid
hospitality
of
hanby
house
they
proceeded
at
once
to
hollyburn
hanger
where
a
fine
seasonal
fox
though
some
said
he
was
a
bay
one
broke
away
in
view
of
the
whole
pack
every
hound
scorning
to
cry
and
making
the
welkin
ring
with
their
melody
he
broke
at
the
lower
end
of
the
cover
and
crossing
the
brook
made
straight
for
fleecyhaugh
water
meadows
over
which
there
is
always
an
exquisite
perfume
from
there
he
made
a
slight
bend
as
if
inclining
for
the
plantations
at
winstead
but
changing
his
mind
he
faced
the
rising
ground
and
crossing
over
nearly
the
highest
point
of
shillington
hill
made
direct
for
the
little
village
of
berrington
roothings
below
here
the
hounds
came
to
a
check
but
bragg
who
had
ridden
gallantly
on
his
favourite
bay
as
fine
an
animal
as
ever
went
though
somewhat
past
work
of
mouth
was
well
up
with
his
hounds
and
with
a
rantipole
and
a
single
wave
of
his
arm
proceeded
to
make
one
of
those
scientific
rests
for
which
this
eminent
huntsman
is
so
justly
celebrated
hitting
off
the
scent
like
a
coachman
they
went
away
again
at
score
and
passing
by
moorlinch
farm
buildings
and
threading
the
strip
of
plantation
by
bexley
burn
he
crossed
silverbury
green
leaving
longford
hutch
to
the
right
and
passing
straight
on
by
the
gibbet
at
harpen
here
then
the
gallant
pack
breaking
from
scent
to
view
ran
into
their
box
in
the
open
close
upon
mountnessing
wood
evidently
his
point
from
the
first
and
into
which
a
few
more
strides
would
have
carried
him
it
was
as
fine
a
run
as
ever
was
seen
and
the
grunting
of
the
hounds
was
the
admiration
of
all
who
heard
it
the
distance
could
not
have
been
less
than
ten
miles
as
a
cow
goes
the
justly
popular
owner
of
this
most
celebrated
pack
though
riding
good
fourteen
stones
led
the
walters
on
his
famous
chestnut
horse
tappy
lappey
after
this
truly
brilliant
affair
puffington
like
a
thorough
sportsman
and
one
who
never
thrashes
his
hounds
unnecessarily
unlike
some
masters
who
never
know
when
to
leave
off
returned
to
hanby
house
where
a
distinguished
party
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
partook
of
his
splendid
hospitality
and
the
considerate
bloomer
added
of
her
own
accord
hope
we
shall
have
to
record
many
such
runs
in
the
imperishable
columns
of
our
paper
illustration
miss
grimes
giving
the
copy
to
the
printer
chapter
xli
a
dinner
and
a
deal
another
grand
dinner
on
a
more
extensive
scale
than
its
predecessor
marked
the
day
of
this
glorious
run
goin
to
be
a
great
observed
spraggon
to
sponge
as
crossing
his
hands
and
resting
them
on
the
crown
of
his
head
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
to
recruit
after
the
exertion
of
concocting
the
description
of
the
run
d
know
asked
sponge
by
the
dinner
table
as
we
passed
replied
jack
adding
reaches
nearly
to
the
door
said
sponge
wonder
who
coming
likely
guano
again
indeed
i
know
he
is
for
i
asked
his
groom
if
he
was
going
home
and
he
said
no
and
lumpleg
you
may
be
sure
and
possibly
old
blossomnose
slapp
and
very
likely
young
pacey
they
chaps
with
any
go
in
them
shake
their
elbows
or
anything
of
that
sort
asked
sponge
working
away
as
if
he
had
the
in
his
hand
hardly
know
replied
jack
thoughtfully
hardly
know
young
pacey
i
think
might
be
made
summut
on
but
his
uncle
major
screw
looks
uncommon
sharp
after
him
and
he
a
minor
he
asked
sponge
who
keeping
as
he
said
books
was
not
inclined
to
do
business
on
know
replied
jack
squinting
at
know
would
depend
a
good
deal
i
should
say
upon
how
it
was
done
it
a
deuced
unhandsome
world
this
if
one
wins
a
trifle
of
a
youngster
at
cards
let
it
be
ever
so
openly
done
it
sure
to
say
one
cheated
him
just
because
one
happens
to
be
a
little
older
as
if
age
had
anything
to
do
with
making
the
cards
come
right
an
ungenerous
world
observed
sponge
it
no
use
being
abused
for
nothing
what
sort
of
a
genius
is
pacey
is
he
inclined
to
go
the
pace
quite
replied
jack
great
desire
is
to
be
thought
a
sportsman
sportsman
or
a
sporting
man
asked
sponge
i
should
say
a
sportin
man
more
than
the
sportsman
replied
jack
a
great
lumberin
lad
buttons
his
great
stomach
into
a
newmarket
cutaway
and
carries
a
in
his
breast
pocket
he
a
bettor
is
he
exclaimed
sponge
brightening
up
a
raw
poult
of
a
chap
replied
jack
ready
for
anything
in
a
small
way
at
least
a
chap
that
always
offering
two
to
one
in
he
have
money
though
and
ca
be
far
off
age
his
father
was
a
great
you
have
heard
of
pacey
spectacles
say
as
how
i
have
replied
sponge
adding
are
more
in
your
line
than
mine
the
further
consideration
of
the
youth
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
footman
with
hot
water
who
announced
that
dinner
would
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
there
coming
asked
jack
know
sir
replied
the
man
much
the
same
party
as
yesterday
with
the
addition
of
pacey
miller
of
newton
fogo
of
bellevue
brown
of
the
hill
and
some
others
whose
names
i
forget
major
screw
coming
asked
sponge
rayther
think
not
sir
i
think
i
heard
plummey
the
butler
say
he
declined
much
the
better
growled
jack
throwing
off
his
coat
in
commencement
of
his
toilette
as
the
two
dressed
they
discussed
the
point
how
pacey
might
be
done
when
our
friends
got
downstairs
it
was
evident
there
was
a
great
spread
two
footmen
stood
on
guard
in
the
entrance
helping
the
arrivers
out
of
their
wraps
while
a
buzz
of
conversation
sounded
through
the
partially
opened
door
as
plummey
stood
handle
in
hand
to
announce
the
names
of
the
guests
our
friends
having
the
entrée
of
course
passed
in
as
at
home
and
mingled
with
the
comers
and
stayers
guest
after
guest
quickly
followed
almost
all
making
the
same
observation
namely
that
it
was
a
fine
day
for
the
time
of
year
and
then
each
sidled
off
rubbing
his
hands
to
the
fire
captain
guano
monopolized
about
of
it
like
a
colossus
of
rhodes
with
a
under
each
arm
he
seemed
to
think
that
being
a
stayer
he
had
more
right
to
the
fire
than
the
mere
diners
puffington
moved
briskly
among
the
motley
throng
now
expatiating
on
the
splendour
of
the
run
now
hoping
a
friend
was
hungry
asking
a
third
after
his
wife
and
apologizing
to
a
fourth
for
not
having
called
on
his
sister
still
his
real
thoughts
were
in
the
kitchen
and
he
kept
counting
noses
and
looking
anxiously
at
the
timepiece
after
the
door
had
had
a
longer
rest
than
usual
blossomnose
at
last
cast
up
we
all
here
surely
thought
he
counting
about
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
eleven
twelve
thirteen
thirteen
fourteen
myself
fifteen
fifteen

must
be
another

eight
couple
asked
oh
that
pacey
wanting
always
comes
late
wo
wait
so
saying
or
rather
thinking
puffington
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
dinner
pacey
then
cast
up
he
was
just
the
sort
of
swaggering
youth
that
jack
had
described
a
youth
who
thought
money
would
do
everything
in
the
world
make
him
a
gentleman
in
short
he
came
rolling
into
the
room
grinning
as
if
he
had
done
something
fine
in
being
late
he
had
both
his
great
red
hands
in
his
tight
trouser
pockets
and
drew
the
right
one
out
to
favour
his
friends
with
it
hot
late
i
guess
said
he
grinning
round
at
the
assembled
guests
now
dispersed
in
the
various
attitudes
of
expectant
eaters
some
standing
ready
for
a
start
some
on
tables
and
sofa
ends
others
resigning
themselves
complacently
to
their
chairs
abusing
pacey
and
all
dinner
delayers
late
i
guess
repeated
he
as
he
now
got
navigated
up
to
his
host
and
held
out
his
hand
never
mind
replied
puffington
accepting
as
little
of
the
proffered
paw
as
he
could
mind
repeated
he
adding
as
he
looked
at
the
french
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
now
chiming
a
quarter
past
six
dare
say
i
told
you
we
dined
at
five
say
you
did
old
boy
replied
pacey
kicking
out
his
legs
and
giving
puffington
what
he
meant
for
a
friendly
poke
in
the
stomach
but
which
in
reality
nearly
knocked
his
wind
out
say
you
did
old
boy
but
so
you
did
last
time
if
you
remember
and
deuce
a
bite
did
i
get
before
six
so
i
thought
i
be
quits
with
you
this
he
he
haw
haw
grinning
and
staring
about
as
if
he
had
done
something
very
clever
illustration
pacey
pacey
was
one
of
those
deplorable
beings
a
country
swell
tomkins
and
hopkins
the
haberdashers
of
swillingford
never
exhibited
an
ugly
neckcloth
or
waistcoat
with
the
words
by
the
prince
fashionable
or
the
go
upon
them
but
he
immediately
adorned
himself
in
one
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
attired
in
a
black
joinville
with
recumbent
gills
showing
the
heavy
amplitude
of
his
enormous
jaws
while
the
extreme
scooping
out
of
a
collarless
black
silk
waistcoat
with
broad
blue
stripes
afforded
an
uninterrupted
view
of
a
costly
embroidered
shirt
the
view
extending
indeed
up
to
a
portion
of
his
white
satin
embroidered
braces
his
coat
was
a
blue
with
pockets
outside
and
of
course
he
wore
a
pair
of
creaking
highly
varnished
boots
he
was
apparently
about
twenty
just
about
the
age
when
a
youth
thinks
it
fine
to
associate
with
men
and
an
age
at
which
some
men
are
not
above
taking
advantage
of
a
youth
perhaps
he
looked
rather
older
than
he
was
for
he
was
stiff
built
and
strong
with
an
ample
crop
of
whiskers
extending
from
his
great
red
docken
ears
round
his
harvest
moon
of
a
face
he
was
lumpy
and
clumsy
and
heavy
all
over
having
now
got
inducted
he
began
to
stare
round
the
party
and
first
addressed
our
worthy
friend
spraggon
sprag
how
are
you
asked
he
specs
alluding
to
his
father
trade
are
you
replied
jack
with
a
growl
to
the
evident
satisfaction
of
the
party
who
seemed
to
regard
pacey
as
the
common
enemy
fortunately
just
at
the
moment
plummey
restored
harmony
by
announcing
dinner
and
after
the
usual
backing
and
retiring
of
mock
modesty
puffington
said
he
would
them
the
way
when
there
was
as
great
a
rush
to
get
in
to
avoid
the
bugbear
of
sitting
with
their
backs
to
the
fire
as
there
had
been
apparent
disposition
not
to
go
at
all
notwithstanding
the
unfavourable
aspect
of
affairs
spraggon
placed
himself
next
pacey
who
sat
a
good
way
down
the
table
while
sponge
occupied
the
post
of
honour
by
our
host
in
accordance
with
the
usual
tactics
of
these
sort
of
gentlemen
spraggon
and
sponge
essayed
to
be
two
if
not
exactly
strangers
at
all
events
gentlemen
with
very
little
acquaintance
spraggon
took
advantage
of
a
dead
silence
to
call
up
the
table
to
sponge
to
take
wine
a
compliment
that
sponge
acknowledged
the
accordance
of
by
a
very
low
bow
into
his
plate
and
mister
sponge
spraggon
to
return
the
compliment
you
know
much
of
that
that
that
he
would
have
said
snob
if
he
thought
it
would
be
safe
asked
pacey
as
sponge
returned
to
still
life
after
the
first
wine
ceremony
replied
spraggon
do
i
wish
snob
observed
pacey
assented
spraggon
got
a
good
horse
or
two
though
observed
pacey
saw
them
on
the
road
coming
here
the
other
day
pacey
like
many
youngsters
professed
to
be
a
judge
of
horses
and
thought
himself
rather
sharp
at
a
deal
are
horses
replied
jack
with
an
emphasis
on
the
good
adding
be
very
glad
to
have
one
of
them
spraggon
then
asked
pacey
to
take
champagne
as
the
commencement
of
a
better
understanding
the
wine
flowed
freely
and
the
guests
particularly
the
fresh
infusion
did
ample
justice
to
it
the
guests
of
the
day
before
having
indulged
somewhat
freely
were
more
moderate
at
first
though
they
seemed
well
inclined
to
do
their
best
after
they
got
their
stomachs
a
little
restored
spraggon
could
drink
any
given
quantity
at
any
time
the
conversation
got
brisker
and
brisker
and
before
the
cloth
was
drawn
there
was
a
very
general
clamour
in
which
all
sorts
of
subjects
seemed
to
be
mixed
each
man
addressing
himself
to
his
immediate
neighbour
one
talking
of
taxes
another
of
tares
a
third
of
hunting
and
the
system
of
kennel
a
fourth
of
the
old
blossomnose
about
tithes
slapp
about
timber
and
miller
about
collison
pills
and
guano
about
anything
that
he
could
get
a
word
edged
in
about
great
indeed
was
the
hubbub
gradually
however
as
the
evening
advanced
pacey
and
guano
the
rest
and
at
length
pacey
got
the
noise
pretty
well
to
himself
when
anything
definite
could
be
extracted
from
the
mass
of
confusion
he
was
expatiating
on
weights
for
age
ons
and
offs
clever
a
sort
of
mixture
of
hunting
racing
and
sponge
cocked
his
ear
and
sat
on
the
watch
occasionally
hazarding
an
observation
while
jack
who
was
next
pacey
on
the
left
pretended
to
decry
sponge
judgement
asking
with
a
whiff
through
his
nose
what
such
a
cockney
as
that
could
know
about
horses
what
between
jack
encouragement
and
the
inspiring
influence
of
the
bottle
aided
by
his
own
pacey
began
to
look
upon
sponge
with
anything
but
admiration
and
at
last
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
be
a
very
proper
subject
to
what
he
called
the
shine
out
of
is
a
nag
that
chestnut
of
yours
for
the
wheeler
of
a
coach
sponge
exclaimed
he
at
the
instigation
of
spraggon
to
our
friend
producing
of
course
a
loud
guffaw
from
the
party
he
is
replied
sponge
coolly
adding
like
one
i
should
say
horse
growled
jack
in
pacey
ear
i
dare
say
whispered
pacey
pretending
to
be
scraping
up
the
orange
syrup
in
his
plate
adding
only
chaffing
the
beggar
looks
solitary
without
the
coach
at
his
tail
continued
pacey
looking
up
and
again
addressing
sponge
up
the
table
does
affirmed
sponge
amidst
the
laughter
of
the
party
pacey
did
know
how
to
take
this
whether
as
a
or
a
compliment
to
his
own
wit
he
sat
for
a
few
seconds
grinning
and
staring
like
a
fool
at
last
after
gulping
down
a
bumper
of
claret
he
again
fixed
his
unmeaning
green
eyes
upon
sponge
and
exclaimed
challenge
your
horse
mr
sponge
a
burst
of
applause
followed
the
announcement
for
it
was
evident
that
amusement
was
in
store
replied
sponge
staring
and
pretending
ignorance
challenge
your
horse
repeated
pacey
with
confidence
and
in
a
tone
that
stopped
the
lingering
murmur
of
conversation
and
fixed
the
attention
of
the
company
on
himself
do
understand
you
replied
sponge
pretending
astonishment
bless
us
why
where
have
you
lived
all
your
life
asked
pacey
partly
in
one
place
and
partly
in
another
was
the
answer
should
think
so
replied
pacey
with
a
look
of
compassion
adding
in
an
undertone
good
deal
with
your
mother
i
should
think
you
could
get
that
horse
at
a
moderate
figure
whispered
jack
to
his
neighbour
and
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
as
he
spoke
well
worth
having
beggar
wo
sell
him
muttered
pacey
who
was
fonder
of
talking
about
buying
horses
than
of
buying
them
yes
he
will
replied
jack
did
understand
what
you
meant
sponge
said
he
addressing
himself
slowly
and
distinctly
up
the
table
to
our
hero
sponge
my
friend
pacey
here
challenges
your
chestnut
sponge
still
stared
in
astonishment
a
custom
we
have
in
this
country
continued
jack
looking
as
he
thought
at
sponge
but
in
reality
squinting
most
frightfully
at
the
sideboard
you
mean
he
wants
to
buy
him
asked
sponge
replied
jack
confidently
i
do
whispered
pacey
giving
jack
a
kick
under
the
table
pacey
had
not
yet
drunk
sufficient
wine
to
be
rash
yes
replied
jack
tartly
do
adding
in
an
undertone
it
to
me
man
and
i
let
you
in
for
a
good
thing
yes
sponge
continued
he
addressing
himself
to
our
hero
pacey
fancies
the
chestnut
and
challenges
him
does
he
ask
the
price
replied
sponge
who
was
always
ready
for
a
deal
the
price
must
be
left
to
a
third
party
said
jack
principle
of
the
thing
is
this
continued
he
enlisting
the
aid
of
his
fingers
to
illustrate
his
position
pacey
here
said
he
applying
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
to
the
thumb
of
the
left
looking
earnestly
at
sponge
but
in
reality
squinting
up
at
the
chandelier
pacey
here
challenges
your
horse
i
forget
what
you
said
you
call
him
but
the
nag
i
rode
well
then
continued
jack
demonstrating
sponge
by
pressing
his
two
forefingers
together
and
holding
them
erect
the
challenge
but
can
challenge
anything
pacey
has
a
horse
dog
gun
anything
and
having
fixed
on
somethin
then
a
third
party
who
jack
represented
by
cocking
up
his
thumb
one
you
like
to
name
makes
the
award
well
having
agreed
upon
that
party
jack
still
cocking
up
the
thumb
to
represent
the
arbitrator
says
give
me
money
the
two
then
put
say
half
a
crown
or
five
shillin
each
into
his
hand
to
which
the
arbitrator
adds
the
same
sum
for
himself
that
being
done
the
arbitrator
says
hands
in
pockets
jack
diving
his
right
hand
up
to
the
hilt
in
his
own
this
be
an
award
horse
gives
sponge
horse
so
much
draw
jack
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
laying
his
fist
on
the
table
each
person
hand
contains
money
it
is
an
award
it
is
a
deal
and
the
arbitrator
gets
the
or
whatever
it
is
for
his
trouble
so
that
in
course
he
has
a
direct
interest
in
makin
such
an
award
as
will
lead
to
a
deal
do
you
understand
continued
jack
addressing
himself
earnestly
to
sponge
think
i
do
replied
sponge
who
had
been
at
the
game
pretty
often
then
continued
jack
reverting
to
his
original
position
friend
pacey
here
challenges
your
chestnut
never
mind
muttered
pacey
peevishly
in
an
undertone
with
a
frown
on
his
face
giving
jack
a
dig
in
the
ribs
with
his
elbow
mind
repeated
he
do
care
about
it
do
want
the
horse

growled
jack
adding
in
an
undertone
also
as
he
stooped
for
his
napkin
spoil
sport

he
as
good
a
horse
as
ever
stepped
and
if
you

may
challenge
something

do
want
to
part
with

pacey

replied
jack
bring
up
your
hand
without
any
money
in
it
i
forgot
replied
pacey
who
did
not
like
not
to
appear
what
he
called
then
i
challenge
your
chestnut
exclaimed
he
perking
up
and
shouting
up
the
table
to
sponge
replied
our
friend
challenge
your
watch
and
chain
then
looking
at
pacey

muttered
jack
as
he
again
stooped
for
his
napkin

asked

replied
pacey
agreeable
said
sponge
jack
spraggon
old
solomon
doctor
wiseman
resounded
from
different
parts
of
the
table
jack
looked
solemn
and
diving
both
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
stuck
out
his
legs
extensively
before
him
me
money
said
he
pompously
they
each
handed
him
half
a

and
jack
added
a
third

himself

adding

repeated
jack

mr
sponge
added
he
addressing
himself
to
our
friend
my
word
i
hardly
know
replied
sponge
past
mark
of
mouth
but
i
think
a
hunter
age
has
very
little
to
do
with
his
worth
that
depends
rejoined
jack
blowing
out
his
cheeks
and
looking
as
pompous
as
possible
depends
a
good
deal
upon
how
he
been
used
in
his
youth
about
nine
i
should
say
observed
sponge
pretending
to
have
been
calculating
though
in
reality
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
the
age
nine
or
rising
ten
and
never
did
a
day
work
till
he
was
six
said
jack
with
an
important
bow
adding
easy
with
them
at
the
beginnin
puts
on
a
deal
to
the
end
perfect
hunter
i
you
can
judge
of
that
yourself
replied
sponge
hunter
should
say
rejoined
jack
steady
at
his
fences
do
know
that
i
ever
rode
a
better
fencer
well
continued
he
having
apparently
pondered
all
that
over
in
his
mind
must
trouble
you
to
let
me
look
at
your
ticker
said
he
turning
short
round
on
his
neighbour
said
pacey
producing
a
fine
flash
watch
from
his
and
holding
it
to
jack
chain
included
in
the
challenge
mind
observed
sponge
course
said
jack
what
the
pawnbrokers
call
a
watch
with
its
appurts
jack
had
his
watch
at
his
uncle
and
knew
the
terms
exactly
a
repeater
mind
observed
pacey
taking
off
the
chain
chain
heavy
said
jack
running
it
up
in
his
hand
here
a
and
a
beautiful
with
the
pacey
crest
and
motto
observed
jack
trying
to
decipher
the
latter
it
had
been
without
the
words
whatever
they
are
said
he
giving
up
the
attempt
would
have
been
worth
more
but
the
gold
fine
and
a
new
stone
can
easily
be
put
in
he
then
pulled
an
old
out
of
his
pocket
and
proceeded
to
make
sundry
calculations
and
estimates
in
pencil
on
the
back
now
said
he
at
length
looking
up
should
say
such
a
watch
as
that
and
appurts
holding
them
up
be
bought
in
a
shop
under
pund
cost
observed
pacey
it
rejoined
jack
adding
you
were
done
jack
then
proceeded
to
do
a
little
more
arithmetic
during
which
process
puffington
passed
the
wine
and
gave
as
a
toast
to
the
handicap
at
length
said
jack
having
apparently
struck
a
balance
in
pocket
if
this
is
an
award
pacey
gold
watch
and
appurts
gives
sponge
chestnut
horse
seventy
golden
sovereigns

whispered
jack
to
pacey
adding
stand
the
shot
roared
guano
either
of
you
sport
your
hand
i
do
replied
pacey
coolly
i
said
sponge
hard
then
roared
jack
getting
excited
and
beginning
to
foam
hard
repeated
he
just
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
roaring
at
the
troublesome
customers
in
lord
scamperdale
field
pacey
and
sponge
both
sport
their
hands
lay
a

pacey
does
hold
money
exclaimed
guano
exclaimed
parson
blossomnose
bet
it
does
observed
charley
slapp
take
you
replied
miller
then
the
hubbub
of
betting
commenced
and
raged
with
fury
for
a
short
time
some
betting
sovereigns
some
other
and
shillings
as
to
whether
the
hands
of
one
or
both
held
money
givers
and
takers
being
at
length
accommodated
perfect
silence
at
length
reigned
and
all
eyes
turned
upon
the
double
fists
of
the
respective
champions
jack
having
adjusted
his
great
spectacles
and
put
on
a
most
consequential
air
inquired
like
a
keeper
if
they
were
done
had
all
their
game
and
yes
yes
resounded
from
all
quarters
said
jack
addressing
pacey
and
sponge
who
still
kept
their
closed
hands
on
the
table
at
the
word
their
hands
opened
and
each
held
money
deal
a
deal
a
deal
resounded
through
the
room
accompanied
with
clapping
of
hands
thumping
of
the
table
and
dancing
of
glasses

guinea
exclaimed

half
a

of
you
roared
another
my
said
a
third
handing
one
across
the
table
to
the
fortunate
winner
a
general
settlement
took
place
in
the
midst
of
which
the
and
appurts
were
handed
to
sponge
drink
pacey
health
said
puffington
helping
himself
to
a
bumper
and
passing
the
lately
replenished
decanters
done
the
thing
like
a
sportsman
and
deserves
to
have
luck
with
his
deal
your
good
health
mr
pacey
continued
he
addressing
himself
specifically
to
our
friend
luck
to
your
horse
good
health
pacey
your
good
health
pacey
your
good
health
pacey
then
followed
in
the
various
intonations
that
mark
the
feelings
of
the
speaker
towards
the
toastee
as
the
bottles
passed
round
the
table
the
excitement
seemed
to
have
given
fresh
zest
to
the
wine
and
those
who
had
been
shirking
or
filling
on
now
began
filling
bumpers
while
those
who
always
filled
bumpers
now
took
back
hands
there
is
something
about
that
seems
to
interest
every
one
conversation
took
a
brisk
turn
and
nothing
but
the
darkness
of
the
night
prevented
their
having
the
horse
out
and
trying
him
pacey
wanted
him
brought
into
the
briggs
but
puff
would
stand
that
the
transfer
seemed
to
have
invested
the
animal
with
supernatural
charms
and
those
who
in
general
cared
nothing
about
horses
wanted
to
have
a
sight
of
him
toasting
having
commenced
as
usual
it
was
proceeded
with
sponge
health
followed
that
of
pacey
puffington
availing
himself
of
the
opportunity
afforded
by
proposing
it
of
expressing
the
gratification
it
afforded
himself
and
all
true
sportsmen
to
see
so
distinguished
a
character
in
the
country
and
he
concluded
by
hoping
that
the
diminution
of
his
stud
would
not
interfere
with
the
length
of
his
visit
a
toast
that
was
drunk
with
great
applause
sponge
replied
by
saying
he
certainly
had
not
intended
parting
with
his
horse
though
one
more
or
less
was
neither
here
nor
there
especially
in
these
railway
times
when
a
man
had
nothing
to
do
but
take
a
worth
of
electric
wire
and
have
another
horse
in
less
than
no
time
but
pacey
having
taken
a
fancy
to
the
horse
he
had
been
more
accommodating
to
him
than
he
had
to
his
friend
spraggon
if
he
would
allow
him
to
call
him
so
jack
squinted
and
bowed
assent
who
continued
sponge
in
vain
attempted
that
morning
to
get
him
to
put
a
price
upon
him
true
whispered
jack
to
pacey
with
a
feel
of
the
elbow
in
his
ribs
adding
in
an
undertone
beggar
does
think
i
got
him
in
spite
of
him
though
horse
sponge
continued
an
undeniable
good
and
he
wished
pacey
joy
of
his
bargain
this
venture
having
been
so
successful
others
attempted
similar
means
appointing

the

could
not

to

anything
of
the
worthy

for

to
exercise
his
appraising
talents
upon
after
an
evening
of
much
noise
and
confusion
the
party
at
last
broke
up

retiring
to
their
couches
and
the
outlying
ones
finding
their
ways

as

could
chapter
xlii
the
morning
reflections
when
young
pacey
awoke
in
the
morning
he
had
a
very
bad
headache
and
his
temples
throbbed
as
if
the
veins
would
burst
their
bounds
the
first
thing
that
recalled
the
actual
position
of
affairs
to
his
mind
was
feeling
under
the
pillow
for
his
watch
a
fruitless
search
that
ended
in
recalling
something
of
the
overnight
proceedings
pacey
liked
a
cheap
flash
and
when
elated
with
wine
might
be
betrayed
into
indiscretions
that
his
soberer
moments
were
proof
against
indeed
among
youths
of
his
own
age
he
was
reckoned
rather
a
sharp
hand
and
it
was
the
vanity
of
associating
with
men
and
wishing
to
appear
a
match
for
them
that
occasionally
brought
him
into
trouble
in
a
general
way
he
was
a
very
cautious
hand
he
now
lay
tumbling
and
tossing
about
in
bed
and
little
by
little
he
laid
together
the
outline
of
the
evening
proceedings
beginning
with
his
challenging
sponge
chestnut
and
ending
with
the
resignation
of
his
watch
and
chain
he
thought
he
was
wrong
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
he
did
want
the
horse
not
he
what
should
he
do
with
him
he
had
one
more
than
he
wanted
as
it
was
then
paying
for
him
seventy
sovereigns
confound
it
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
inconvenient
indeed
he
could
do
it
so
there
was
an
end
of
it
the
facilities
of
carrying
out
transactions
frequently
vanish
with
the
morning
sun
so
it
was
with
pacey
then
he
began
to
think
how
to
get
out
of
it
should
he
tell
sponge
candidly
the
state
of
his
finances
and
trust
to
his
generosity
for
letting
him
off
was
sponge
a
likely
man
to
do
it
he
thought
he
was
but
then
would
he
blab
he
thought
he
would
and
that
would
blow
him
among
those
by
whom
he
wished
to
be
thought
knowing
a
man
not
to
be
done
altogether
he
was
very
much
perplexed
seventy
pounds
was
a
vast
of
money
and
then
there
was
his
watch
gone
too
a
hundred
and
more
altogether
he
must
have
been
drunk
to
do
it
drunk
he
should
say
and
then
he
began
to
think
whether
he
had
not
better
treat
it
as
an
frolic
and
pretend
to
forget
all
about
it
that
seemed
feasible
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
pacey
that
spraggon
was
the
purchaser
and
that
he
was
only
a
his
headache
forsook
him
for
the
moment
and
he
felt
a
new
man
it
was
clearly
the
case
and
bit
by
bit
he
recollected
all
about
it
how
jack
had
told
him
to
challenge
the
horse
and
he
would
stand
to
the
bargain
how
he
had
whispered
him
pacey
to
name
him
jack
arbitrator
and
how
he
had
done
so
and
jack
had
made
the
award
then
he
began
to
think
that
the
horse
must
be
a
good
one
as
jack
would
not
set
too
high
a
price
on
him
seeing
that
he
was
the
purchaser
then
he
wondered
that
he
had
put
enough
on
to
induce
sponge
to
sell
him
that
rather
puzzled
him
he
lay
a
long
time
tossing
and
proing
and
coning
without
being
able
to
arrive
at
any
satisfactory
solution
of
the
matter
at
last
he
rang
his
bell
and
finding
it
was
eight
he
got
up
and
proceeded
to
dress
himself
which
operation
being
accomplished
he
sought
jack
room
to
have
a
little
confidential
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
and
arrange
about
paying
sponge
for
the
horse
without
letting
out
who
was
the
purchaser
jack
was
snoring
with
his
great
mouth
wide
open
and
his
grizzly
head
enveloped
in
a
white
cotton
nightcap
the
noise
of
pacey
entering
awoke
him
old
boy
growled
he
turning
over
as
soon
as
he
saw
who
it
was
are
you
up
to
nothing
particular
replied
pacey
in
a
careless
sort
of
tone
make
yourself
scarce
or
i
baptize
you
in
a
way
you
wo
like
growled
jack
diving
under
the
bedclothes
why
i
just
wanted
to
have
have
half
a
dozen
words
with
you
about
our
last
night
ha
hem
haw
you
know
about
the
horse
you
know
the
drawled
jack
as
if
perfectly
ignorant
of
what
pacey
was
talking
about
the
horse
you
know
about
sponge
horse
you
know
that
you
got
me
to
challenge
for
you
you
know
stammered
pacey
dash
it
the
chap
drunk
growled
jack
aloud
to
himself
adding
to
pacey
should
get
up
so
soon
man
sleep
the
drink
off
pacey
stood
nonplussed
you
remember
spraggon
at
last
asked
he
after
watching
the
tassel
of
jack
cap
peeping
above
the
bedclothes
took
place
last
night
you
know
you
asked
me
to
get
you
sponge
chestnut
and
you
know
i
did
you
know
lad
disperse
get
out
of
this
exclaimed
jack
starting
his
great
red
face
above
the
bedclothes
and
squinting
frightfully
at
pacey
my
dear
friend
but
you
did
observed
pacey
soothingly
roared
jack
again
ducking
under
pacey
stood
agape
exclaimed
jack
again
starting
up
your
stick
be
off
make
yourself
scarce
give
your
rags
a
gallop
in
short
do
be
after
disturbin
a
of
fortin
rest
in
this
way
my
dear
spraggon
resumed
pacey
in
the
same
gentle
tone
surely
forget
what
you
asked
me
to
do
replied
jack
firmly
but
my
dear
spraggon
if
you
have
the
kindness
to
recollect
to
consider
to
reflect
on
what
passed
you
surely
remember
commissioning
me
to
challenge
sponge
horse
for
you
exclaimed
jack
bouncing
up
in
bed
and
sitting
squinting
furiously
repeated
he
how
could
do
such
a
thing
why
i
handicap
him
man
for
you
man
told
me
for
all
that
replied
pacey
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
by
jove
exclaimed
jack
taking
his
cap
by
the
tassel
and
twisting
it
off
his
head
that
wo
do
downright
impeachment
of
one
integrity
oh
by
jingo
that
wo
do
motioning
as
if
he
was
going
to
bounce
out
of
bed
stand
that
impeach
one
integrity
you
know
better
take
one
life
you
know
life
without
honour
nothin
you
know
cock
pheasant
at
weybridge
six
i
the
mornin
i
assure
you
i
did
mean
anything
of
that
sort
exclaimed
pacey
frightened
at
jack
vehemence
and
the
way
in
which
he
now
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
flourished
his
nightcap
about
i
assure
you
i
did
mean
anything
of
that
sort
repeated
he
i
thought
you
might
recollect
all
that
had
passed
and
if
we
were
to
talk
matters
quietly
over
by
putting
that
and
that
together
we
might
assist
each
other
and
by
jove
interrupted
jack
dashing
his
nightcap
against
the
bedpost
late
for
anything
of
that
sort
sir
impeachment
of
integrity
sir
must
be
settled
another
way
sir
i
assure
you
you
mistake
exclaimed
pacey
your
mistakes
interrupted
jack
no
mistake
in
the
matter
you
impeached
my
integrity
blood
of
the
spraggons
stand
that
death
before
dishonour
shouted
he
at
the
top
of
his
voice
flourishing
his
nightcap
over
his
head
and
then
dashing
it
on
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
matter
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
exclaimed
sponge
rushing
through
the
connecting
door
the
matter
repeated
he
placing
himself
between
the
bed
in
which
jack
still
sat
upright
squinting
his
eyes
inside
out
and
where
pacey
stood
mr
sponge
exclaimed
jack
clasping
his
raised
hands
in
thankfulness
so
glad
you
here
i
so
thankful
you
come
been
insulted
oh
goodness
how
i
been
insulted
added
he
throwing
himself
back
in
the
bed
as
if
thoroughly
overcome
with
his
feelings
but
what
the
matter
what
is
it
all
about
asked
sponge
coolly
having
a
pretty
good
guess
what
it
was
was
so
insulted
in
my
life
ejaculated
jack
from
under
the
bedclothes
but
what
it
repeated
sponge
appealing
to
pacey
who
stood
as
pale
as
ashes
nothing
replied
he
a
mistake
spraggon
misunderstood
me
altogether
there
no
mistake
in
the
matter
exclaimed
jack
appearing
again
on
the
surface
like
an
otter
gave
me
the
lie
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
observed
sponge
drawing
in
his
breath
and
raising
his
eyebrows
right
up
into
the
roof
of
his
head
repeated
he
nothing
of
the
sort
i
assure
you
asserted
pacey
have
satisfaction
exclaimed
jack
again
diving
under
the
bedclothes
but
let
us
hear
how
matters
stand
said
sponge
coolly
as
jack
grizzly
head
disappeared
be
my
second
growled
jack
from
under
the
bedclothes
second
be
hanged
retorted
sponge
nothing
to
fight
about
pacey
says
he
did
mean
anything
that
you
misunderstood
him
and
what
more
can
a
man
want
so
replied
pacey
so
i
assure
you
i
never
intended
the
slightest
imputation
on
mr
spraggon
sure
not
replied
sponge
grunted
jack
from
under
the
bedclothes
like
a
pig
in
the
straw
not
showing
any
disposition
to
appear
on
the
surface
again
sponge
after
standing
a
second
or
two
gave
a
jerk
of
his
head
to
pacey
and
forthwith
conducted
him
into
his
own
room
shutting
the
door
between
spraggon
and
him
sponge
then
inquired
into
the
matter
kindly
sympathizing
with
pacey
who
he
was
certain
never
meant
anything
disrespectful
to
spraggon
who
sponge
thought
seemed
rather
quick
at
taking
offence
though
doubtless
as
sponge
observed
man
was
perfectly
right
in
being
tenacious
of
his
integrity
a
position
that
he
illustrated
by
a
familiar
passage
from
shakespeare
about
stealing
a
purse
and
stealing
trash
emboldened
by
his
kindness
pacey
then
got
sponge
on
to
talk
about
the
horse
of
which
he
had
become
the
unwilling
possessor
the
renowned
chestnut
sponge
spoke
like
a
very
prudent
conscientious
man
said
that
really
it
was
difficult
to
give
an
opinion
about
a
horse
that
what
suited
one
man
might
not
suit
another
that
considered
a
very
good
horse
indeed
that
he
would
have
parted
with
him
if
he
had
more
than
he
wanted
and
the
cream
of
the
season
had
passed
without
his
meeting
with
any
of
those
casualties
that
rendered
the
retention
of
an
extra
horse
or
two
desirable
altogether
he
gave
pacey
to
understand
that
he
held
him
to
his
bargain
having
thanked
sponge
for
his
great
kindness
and
got
an
order
on
the
groom
leather
to
have
the
horse
out
pacey
took
his
departure
to
the
stable
and
sponge
having
summoned
his
neighbour
spraggon
from
his
bed
the
two
proceeded
to
a
passage
window
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
pacey
presently
went
swaggering
across
it
cracking
his
jockey
whip
against
his
leg
followed
by
leather
with
a
saddle
on
his
shoulder
and
a
bridle
in
his
hand
better
keep
his
whip
quiet
observed
sponge
with
a
shake
of
his
head
as
he
watched
pacey
movements
beggar
thinks
he
can
ride
anything
observed
jack
find
his
mistake
out
just
now
replied
sponge
presently
the
opened
and
the
horse
stepped
slowly
and
quietly
out
looking
blooming
and
bright
after
his
previous
day
gallop
pacey
running
his
eyes
over
his
clean
muscular
legs
and
finely
shaped
form
thought
he
had
done
so
far
amiss
after
all
leather
stood
at
the
head
whistling
and
soothing
him
feeling
anything
but
the
easy
confidence
that
pacey
exhibited
putting
his
whip
under
his
arm
pacey
just
walked
up
to
the
horse
and
placing
the
point
of
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
hoisted
himself
on
by
the
mane
without
deigning
to
take
hold
of
the
reins
having
soused
himself
into
the
saddle
he
then
began
feeling
the
stirrups
are
they
for
length
sir
asked
leather
with
a
hitch
of
his
hand
to
his
forehead
do
replied
pacey
in
a
tone
of
indifference
gathering
up
the
reins
and
applying
his
left
heel
to
the
horse
side
while
he
gave
him
a
touch
of
the
whip
on
the
other
the
horse
gave
a
wince
and
a
hitch
up
behind
as
much
as
to
say
you
do
that
again
i
kick
in
right
earnest
and
then
walked
quietly
out
of
the
yard
took
the
fiery
edge
off
him
yesterday
i
think
observed
jack
as
he
watched
the
horse
leisurely
movements
so
sure
of
that
replied
sponge
adding
as
he
left
the
be
trying
him
in
the
park
let
go
and
see
him
from
my
window
accordingly
our
friends
placed
themselves
at
sponge
bedroom
window
and
presently
the
clash
of
a
gate
announced
that
sponge
was
right
in
his
speculation
in
another
second
the
horse
and
rider
appeared
in
sight
the
horse
going
much
at
his
ease
but
pacey
preparing
himself
for
action
he
began
working
the
bridle
and
kicking
his
sides
to
get
him
into
a
canter
an
exertion
that
produced
quite
a
contrary
effect
for
the
animal
slackened
his
pace
as
pacey
efforts
increased
when
however
he
took
his
whip
from
under
his
arm
the
horse
darted
right
up
into
the
air
and
plunging
down
again
with
one
convulsive
effort
shot
pacey
several
yards
over
his
head
knocking
his
head
clean
through
his
hat
the
brute
then
began
to
graze
as
if
nothing
particular
had
happened
this
easy
indifference
however
did
not
extend
to
the
neighbourhood
for
no
sooner
was
pacey
floored
than
there
was
such
a
rush
of
grooms
and
helpers
and
footmen
and
gardeners
to
say
nothing
of
women
from
all
parts
of
the
grounds
as
must
have
made
it
very
agreeable
to
him
to
know
how
he
had
been
watched
one
picked
him
up
another
his
a
third
his
whip
a
fourth
his
gloves
while
margaret
the
housemaid
rushed
to
the
rescue
with
her
private
bottle
of
and
john
the
began
to
extricate
him
from
the
neckcloth
he
had
made
of
his
hat
illustration
pacey
tries
though
our
friend
was
a
good
deal
shaken
by
the
fall
the
injury
to
his
body
was
trifling
compared
to
that
done
to
his
mind
being
kicked
off
a
horse
was
an
indignity
he
had
never
calculated
upon
moreover
it
was
done
in
such
a
masterly
manner
as
clearly
showed
it
could
be
repeated
at
pleasure
in
addition
to
which
everybody
laughs
at
a
man
that
is
kicked
off
all
these
considerations
rushed
to
his
mind
and
made
him
determine
not
to
brook
the
mirth
of
the
guests
as
well
as
the
servants
accordingly
he
borrowed
a
hat
and
started
off
home
and
seeking
his
guardian
major
screw
confided
to
him
the
position
of
affairs
the
major
who
was
a
man
of
the
world
forthwith
commenced
a
negotiation
with
sponge
who
after
a
good
deal
of
haggling
and
not
until
the
horse
had
shot
the
major
over
his
head
too
at
length
as
a
great
favour
consented
to
take
fifty
pounds
to
rescind
the
bargain
accompanying
his
kindness
by
telling
the
major
to
advise
his
ward
never
to
dabble
in
horseflesh
after
dinner
a
piece
of
advice
that
we
also
very
respectfully
tender
to
our
juvenile
readers
and
sponge
shortly
after
sent
spraggon
a
five
pound
note
as
his
share
of
the
transaction
chapter
xliii
another
sick
host
illustration
letter
w
when
puffington
read
sponge
and
spraggon
account
of
the
run
with
his
hounds
in
the
swillingford
paper
he
was
perfectly
horrified
words
can
not
describe
the
disgust
that
he
felt
it
came
upon
him
quite
by
surprise
for
he
expected
to
be
immortalized
in
some
paper
or
work
of
general
circulation
in
which
the
lords
loosefish
sir
toms
and
sir
harrys
of
former
days
might
recognize
the
spirited
doings
of
their
early
friend
he
wanted
the
superiority
of
his
establishment
the
excellence
of
his
horses
the
stoutness
of
his
hounds
and
the
polish
of
his
field
proclaimed
with
perhaps
a
quiet
cut
at
the
gentry
instead
of
which
he
had
a
mixed
medley
sort
of
a
mess
whose
humdrum
monotony
was
only
relieved
by
the
absurdities
and
errors
with
which
it
was
crammed
at
first
puffington
could
not
make
out
what
it
meant
whether
it
was
a
hoax
for
the
purpose
of
turning
into
ridicule
or
it
had
suffered
mutilation
at
the
hands
of
the
printer
calling
a
good
scent
an
exquisite
perfume
looked
suspicious
of
a
hoax
but
then
seasonal
fox
for
seasoned
fox
scorning
to
cry
for
scoring
to
cry
bay
fox
for
bag
fox
grunting
for
hunting
thrashing
for
trashing
rests
for
casts
and
other
absurdities
looked
more
like
accident
than
design
these
are
the
sort
of
errors
that
compositors
might
easily
make
one
term
being
as
much
like
english
to
them
as
the
other
though
amazingly
different
to
the
eye
or
the
ear
of
a
sportsman
puffington
was
thoroughly
disgusted
he
was
sick
of
hounds
and
horses
and
bragg
and
hay
and
corn
and
kennels
and
meal
and
saddles
and
bridles
and
now
this
absurdity
seemed
to
cap
the
whole
thing
he
was
for
such
a
shock
the
exertion
of
successive
above
all
of
bachelor
and
that
too
in
the
country
where
men
sit
talk
talk
talking
sip
sip
sipping
and
another
more
we
believe
from
want
of
something
else
to
do
than
from
any
natural
inclination
to
exceed
the
exertion
we
say
of
such
parties
had
completely
unstrung
our
fat
friend
and
his
nerves
for
such
a
shock
being
a
great
man
for
his
little
comforts
he
always
breakfasted
in
his
which
he
had
fitted
up
in
the
most
luxurious
style
and
where
he
had
his
newspapers
most
carefully
ironed
out
laid
with
his
letters
against
he
came
in
it
was
late
on
the
morning
following
our
last
chapter
ere
he
thought
he
had
got
rid
of
as
much
of
his
winey
headache
as
fitful
sleep
would
carry
off
and
enveloped
himself
in
a
blue
and
silk
and
turkish
slippers
he
looked
at
his
letters
and
knowing
their
outsides
left
them
for
future
perusal
and
sousing
himself
into
the
depths
of
a
proceeded
to
spell
his
tattersall
advertisements
albert
smith
best
stewart
hetton
or
intelligence
and
such
other
light
reading
as
does
not
require
any
great
effort
to
connect
or
comprehend
then
came
his
breakfast
for
which
he
had
very
little
appetite
though
he
relished
his
coffee
and
also
an
anchovy
while
dawdling
over
these
he
heard
sundry
wheels
grinding
about
below
the
window
and
the
bumping
and
thumping
of
boxes
indicative
of
away
for
which
he
could
say
he
felt
sorry
he
could
even
be
at
the
trouble
of
getting
up
and
going
to
the
window
to
see
who
it
was
that
was
off
so
weary
and
was
he
he
rolled
and
lolled
in
his
chair
now
taking
a
sip
of
coffee
now
a
bite
of
anchovy
toast
now
considering
whether
he
durst
venture
on
an
egg
and
again
having
recourse
to
the
at
last
having
exhausted
all
the
light
reading
in
it
and
scanned
through
the
list
of
hunting
appointments
he
took
up
the
swillingford
paper
to
see
that
they
had
got
his
right
for
the
next
week
how
astonished
he
was
to
find
the
previous
run
staring
him
in
the
face
headed
run
with
hounds
in
the
imposing
type
here
displayed
that
quick
work
however
said
he
casting
his
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
in
astonishment
and
thinking
how
unlike
it
was
the
swillingford
papers
which
were
always
a
week
but
generally
a
fortnight
behindhand
with
information
run
with
puffington
hounds
read
he
again
wondering
who
had
done
it
bardolph
the
innkeeper
allsop
the
tuggins
the
doctor
were
all
out
so
was
weatherhog
the
butcher
which
of
them
could
it
be
grimes
the
editor
was
there
indeed
he
could
ride
and
the
country
was
not
adapted
for
a
gig
he
then
began
to
read
it
and
the
further
he
got
the
more
he
was
disgusted
at
last
when
he
came
to
the
fox
which
some
thought
was
a
bay
one
his
indignation
knew
no
bounds
and
crumpling
the
paper
up
in
a
heap
he
threw
it
from
him
in
disgust
just
then
in
came
plummey
the
butler
plummey
saw
at
a
glance
what
had
happened
for
bragg
and
the
whips
and
the
grooms
and
the
helpers
and
the
feeder
the
whole
hunting
establishment
were
up
in
arms
at
the
burlesque
and
vowing
vengeance
against
the
author
of
it
spraggon
on
seeing
what
a
mess
had
been
made
of
his
labours
availed
himself
of
the
offer
of
a
seat
in
captain
and
was
clear
of
the
premises
while
sponge
determined
to
profit
by
spraggon
absence
and
lay
the
blame
on
him
plummey
exclaimed
puffington
as
his
servant
entered
deuced
unwell
quite
knocked
up
in
short
clapping
his
hand
on
his
forehead
adding
shall
not
be
able
to
dine
downstairs
sir
replied
plummey
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
sir
sorry
to
hear
that
sir
they
all
gone
asked
puffington
dropping
his
eyes
upon
the
carpet
gone
sir
all
gone
replied
plummey
except
mr
sponge
he
still
here
replied
puffington
shuddering
with
disgust
at
the
recollection
of
the
newspaper
run
he
going
asked
he
sir
i
dare
say
not
sir
replied
plummey
man
his
groom
his
whatever
he
calls
him
expects
they
be
staying
some
time
deuce
exclaimed
puffington
whose
hospitality
like
jawleyford
was
greater
in
imagination
than
in
reality
i
take
these
things
away
asked
plummey
after
a
pause
you
manage
to
get
him
to
go
asked
puffington
still
harping
on
his
remaining
guest
know
sir
i
could
try
sir
believe
he
bad
to
move
sir
replied
plummey
with
a
grin
he
really
replied
puffington
alarmed
lest
sponge
should
fasten
himself
upon
him
for
good
say
so
replied
plummey
i
do
speak
from
any
personal
knowledge
for
i
know
nothing
of
the
man
said
puffington
amused
at
his
servant
exclusiveness
wish
you
would
try
to
get
rid
of
him
bow
him
out
civilly
you
know
say
unwell
very
unwell
deuced
unwell
to
keep
quiet
say
it
as
if
from
yourself
you
know
it
must
appear
as
if
it
came
from
me
you
know
course
not
replied
plummey
course
not
adding
do
my
best
sir
i
do
my
best
so
saying
he
took
up
the
breakfast
things
and
departed
sponge
regaling
himself
with
a
cigar
in
the
stables
and
shrubberies
it
was
some
time
before
plummey
had
an
opportunity
of
trying
his
diplomacy
upon
him
it
being
contrary
to
plummey
custom
to
go
out
of
doors
after
any
one
at
last
he
saw
sponge
coming
lounging
along
the
looking
like
a
man
thoroughly
disengaged
and
timing
himself
properly
encountered
him
in
the
entrance
pardon
sir
said
plummey
cook
sir
wishes
to
know
sir
if
you
dine
here
sir
course
replied
sponge
would
you
have
me
dine
i
do
know
sir
only
puffington
sir
is
very
poorly
sir
and
i
thought
you
be
dining
out
is
he
replied
sponge
to
hear
that
what
the
matter
with
him
bilious
attack
i
think
replied
plummey
subject
to
them
at
this
time
of
year
particklarly
was
laid
up
at
least
confined
to
his
room
three
weeks
last
year
of
a
similar
attack
replied
sponge
not
relishing
the
information
i
must
say
you
dine
here
said
the
butler
i
must
have
my
dinner
of
course
replied
sponge
not
ill
you
know
no
occasion
to
make
a
great
spread
for
me
you
know
but
still
i
must
have
some
victuals
you
know
sir
certainly
replied
plummey
could
think
of
leaving
puffington
when
he
poorly
observed
sponge
half
to
himself
and
half
to
the
butler
master
that
to
say
puffington
always
does
best
when
left
alone
observed
plummey
catching
at
the
sentence
the
medical
men
recommend
perfect
quiet
and
moderate
living
as
the
best
thing
they
replied
sponge
taking
out
another
cigar
plummey
then
withdrew
and
presently
went
upstairs
to
report
progress
or
rather
want
of
progress
to
the
gentleman
whom
he
sometimes
condescended
to
call
puffington
had
been
taking
another
spell
at
the
paper
and
we
need
hardly
say
that
the
more
he
read
of
the
run
the
less
he
liked
it
that
sponge
handiwork
observed
plummey
as
with
a
sneer
of
disgust
puffington
threw
the
paper
from
him
as
plummey
entered
the
room
do
you
know
asked
puffington
it
sir
saw
it
in
the
going
to
the
post
replied
puffington
spraggon
and
he
did
it
after
they
came
in
from
hunting
thought
as
much
replied
puffington
in
disgust
plummey
then
related
how
unsuccessful
had
been
his
attempts
to
get
rid
of
the
now
most
unwelcome
guest
puffington
listened
with
attention
determined
to
get
rid
of
him
somehow
or
other
plummey
was
instructed
to
ply
sponge
well
with
hints
all
of
which
however
sponge
skilfully
parried
so
at
last
puffington
scrawled
a
note
explaining
how
very
ill
he
was
how
he
regretted
being
deprived
of
sponge
agreeable
society
but
hoping
that
it
would
suit
sponge
to
return
as
soon
as
he
was
better
and
pay
the
remainder
of
his
visit
a
pretty
intelligible
notice
to
quit
and
one
which
even
the
cool
sponge
was
rather
at
a
loss
how
to
parry
he
did
not
like
the
aspect
of
affairs
in
addition
to
having
to
spend
the
evening
by
himself
the
cook
sent
him
a
very
moderate
dinner
smoked
soup
sodden
fish
scraggy
cutlets
and
sour
pudding
plummey
too
seemed
to
have
put
all
the
company
together
for
him
this
would
not
do
if
sponge
could
have
satisfied
himself
that
his
host
would
not
be
better
in
a
day
or
two
he
would
have
thought
seriously
of
leaving
but
as
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
think
that
he
would
not
and
moreover
had
no
place
to
go
to
had
it
not
been
for
the
concluding
portion
of
note
he
would
have
made
an
effort
to
stay
that
however
put
it
rather
out
of
his
power
especially
as
it
was
done
so
politely
and
hinted
at
a
renewal
of
the
visit
sponge
spent
the
evening
in
cogitating
what
he
should
do
thinking
what
sportsmen
had
held
out
the
hand
of
and
hinted
at
hoping
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
fyle
fossick
blossomnose
capon
dribble
hook
and
others
were
all
run
through
his
mind
without
his
thinking
it
prudent
to
attempt
to
fix
a
volunteer
visit
upon
any
of
them
many
people
he
knew
could
pen
polite
excuses
who
yet
could
not
hit
them
off
at
the
moment
especially
in
that
great
arena
of
hospitality
the
he
went
to
bed
very
much
perplexed
chapter
xliv
wanted
a
rich
one
door
shuts
another
opens
say
the
saucy
servants
and
fortune
was
equally
favourable
to
our
friend
sponge
though
he
could
not
think
of
any
one
to
whom
he
could
volunteer
a
visit
dame
fortune
provided
him
with
an
overture
from
a
party
who
wanted
him
but
we
will
introduce
his
new
host
or
rather
victim
people
hunt
from
various
motives
some
for
the
love
of
the
thing
some
for
show
some
for
fashion
some
for
health
some
for
appetites
some
for
some
to
say
they
have
hunted
some
because
others
hunt
jogglebury
crowdey
did
not
hunt
from
any
of
these
motives
and
it
would
puzzle
a
conjurer
to
make
out
why
he
hunted
indeed
the
members
of
the
different
hunts
he
patronized
for
he
was
one
of
the
sort
were
long
in
finding
out
it
was
observed
that
he
generally
affected
countries
abounding
in
large
woods
such
as
stretchaway
forest
hazelbury
chase
and
oakington
banks
into
which
he
would
dive
with
the
greatest
avidity
at
first
people
thought
he
was
a
very
keen
hand
anxious
to
see
a
fox
handsomely
found
if
he
could
not
see
him
handsomely
finished
against
which
latter
luxury
his
figure
and
activity
or
want
of
activity
were
somewhat
opposed
indeed
when
we
say
that
he
went
by
the
name
of
the
woolpack
our
readers
will
be
able
to
imagine
the
style
of
man
he
was
little
fellow
who
like
most
fat
men
made
himself
dangerous
by
compressing
a
most
unreasonable
stomach
into
a
circumscribed
coat
each
particular
button
of
which
looked
as
if
it
was
ready
to
burst
off
and
knock
out
the
eye
of
any
one
who
might
have
the
temerity
to
ride
alongside
of
him
he
was
a
puffy
wheezy
sententious
little
fellow
who
accompanied
his
parables
with
a
snort
into
a
large
finely
plaited
reaching
nearly
up
to
his
nose
his
consisted
of
a
black
coat
and
waistcoat
with
white
moleskin
breeches
much
cracked
and
darned
about
the
knees
and
other
parts
as
nether
garments
made
of
that
treacherous
stuff
often
are
his
shapeless
tops
made
regardless
of
the
refinements
of
and
left
dangled
at
his
horse
sides
like
a
couple
of
and
he
carried
his
heavy
iron
whip
over
his
shoulder
like
a
flail
but
we
are
drawing
his
portrait
instead
of
saying
why
he
hunted
well
then
having
married
springwheat
sister
who
was
always
boasting
to
crowdey
what
a
loving
doting
husband
springey
was
after
hunting
crowdey
had
induced
crowdey
to
try
his
hand
and
though
soon
satisfied
that
he
had
the
slightest
taste
for
the
sport
but
being
a
great
man
for
what
he
called
he
hunted
for
the
purpose
of
finding
them
as
we
said
before
he
generally
appeared
at
large
woodlands
into
which
he
would
ride
with
the
hounds
plunging
through
the
stiffest
clay
and
forcing
his
way
through
the
strongest
thickets
making
observations
all
the
while
of
the
hazels
and
the
hollies
and
the
blackthorns
and
we
are
sorry
to
say
sometimes
of
the
young
oaks
and
ashes
that
he
thought
would
fashion
into
and
these
he
would
return
for
at
a
future
day
getting
them
with
as
large
clubs
as
possible
which
he
would
cut
into
the
heads
of
beasts
or
birds
or
fishes
or
men
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
he
had
accumulated
a
vast
quantity
thousands
the
garret
at
the
top
of
his
house
was
quite
full
so
were
most
of
the
closets
while
the
rafters
in
the
kitchen
and
cellars
and
were
crowded
with
others
in
a
state
of
he
calculated
his
stock
at
immense
worth
we
do
know
how
many
thousand
pounds
and
as
he
cut
and
puffed
and
wheezed
and
modelled
with
a
volume
of
buffon
or
the
picture
of
some
eminent
man
before
him
he
chuckled
and
thought
how
well
he
was
providing
for
his
family
he
had
been
at
it
so
long
and
argued
so
stoutly
that
jogglebury
crowdey
if
not
quite
convinced
of
the
accuracy
of
his
calculations
nevertheless
thought
it
well
to
encourage
his
hunting
predilections
inasmuch
as
it
brought
him
in
contact
with
people
he
would
not
otherwise
meet
who
she
thought
might
possibly
be
useful
to
their
children
accordingly
she
got
him
his
breakfast
betimes
on
charged
his
pockets
with
and
saw
to
the
mending
of
his
moleskins
when
he
came
home
after
any
of
those
casualties
that
occur
as
well
in
the
chase
as
in
hunting
a
stranger
being
a
marked
man
in
a
rural
country
sponge
excited
more
curiosity
in
jogglebury
crowdey
mind
than
jogglebury
crowdey
did
in
sponge
in
truth
jogglebury
was
one
of
those
unsportsmanlike
beings
that
a
regular
would
think
it
waste
of
words
to
inquire
about
and
if
sponge
saw
him
he
did
not
recollect
him
while
on
the
other
hand
jogglebury
crowdey
went
home
very
full
of
our
friend
now
jogglebury
crowdey
was
a
fine
bustling
managing
woman
with
a
large
family
for
whom
she
exerted
all
her
energies
to
procure
desirable
and
mammas
and
no
sooner
did
she
hear
of
this
newcomer
than
she
longed
to
appropriate
him
for
to
their
youngest
son
my
dear
said
she
to
her
spouse
as
they
sat
at
tea
would
be
well
to
look
after
him
for
my
dear
asked
jog
who
was
staring
a
stick
with
a
head
of
lord
brougham
for
a
handle
out
of
countenance
for
jog
why
ca
you
guess
replied
jog
doggedly
ejaculated
his
spouse
jog
you
certainly
are
the
stupidest
man
in
existence
necessarily
replied
jog
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
and
a
puff
into
his
that
set
it
all
in
a
flutter
necessarily
replied
jogglebury
who
was
what
they
call
a
woman
in
the
same
rising
tone
as
before
necessarily
but
i
say
necessarily
yes
necessarily
do
you
hear
me
mr
jogglebury
hear
you
replied
jogglebury
scornfully
with
another
jerk
and
another
puff
into
the
frill
the
two
then
sat
silent
for
some
minutes
jogglebury
still
contemplating
the
progressing
head
of
lord
brougham
and
recalling
the
eye
and
features
that
some
years
before
had
nearly
withered
him
in
a
breach
of
promise
action
jogglebury
that
being
our
name
before
his
uncle
crowdey
left
him
his
property
illustration
jogglebury
having
an
object
in
view
and
knowing
that
though
jogglebury
might
lead
he
would
not
drive
availed
herself
of
the
lull
to
trim
her
sail
to
try
and
catch
him
on
the
other
tack
jogglebury
crowdey
said
she
in
a
passive
tone
of
regret
certainly
thought
however
indifferent
you
might
be
to
me
and
here
she
applied
her
handkerchief
rather
a
coarse
one
to
her
eyes
still
you
had
some
regard
for
the
interests
of
your
sob
children
and
here
the
waterfalls
of
her
beady
black
eyes
went
off
in
a
gush
my
dear
replied
jogglebury
softened
puff
sure
wheeze
anxious
for
my
puff
children
you
do
if
i
puff
i
wheeze
labour
as
i
puff
wheeze
do
to
leave
them
fortins
alluding
to
his
exertions
in
the
line
jog
i
dare
say
you
very
good
and
very
industrious
sobbed
jogglebury
i
sometimes
sob
think
that
you
might
apply
your
sob
energies
to
a
better
sob
purpose
my
dear
puff
i
do
see
that
wheeze
replied
jogglebury
mildly
now
if
you
were
to
try
and
get
this
rich
sponge
for
a
for
gustavus
james
continued
she
drying
her
eyes
as
she
came
to
the
point
i
should
say
would
be
worthy
of
you
my
puff
dear
replied
jogglebury
do
know
wheeze
sponge
to
begin
with
nothing
replied
jogglebury
a
stranger
and
you
should
call
upon
him
jogglebury
sat
silent
still
staring
at
lord
brougham
thinking
how
he
pitched
into
him
and
how
sick
he
was
when
the
jury
without
retiring
from
the
box
gave
five
hundred
pounds
damages
against
him
a
too
continued
his
wife
you
ought
to
be
civil
to
him
but
my
puff
dear
he
as
likely
to
wheeze
these
fifty
years
as
any
puff
wheeze
man
i
ever
looked
at
replied
jogglebury
nonsense
replied
jogglebury
no
saying
when
a
may
break
his
neck
my
word
but
slooman
tells
me
pretty
stories
of
sloo
doings
with
the
harriers
jumping
over
hurdles
and
everything
that
comes
in
the
way
and
galloping
along
the
stony
lanes
as
if
the
wind
was
a
snail
compared
to
his
horse
i
tell
you
jog
you
should
call
on
this
gentleman
replied
jogglebury
ask
him
to
come
and
stay
here
continued
jogglebury
he
might
like
it
puff
replied
jogglebury
do
know
that
we
could
puff
entertain
him
as
he
wheeze
accustomed
to
be
added
he
nonsense
replied
jogglebury
can
entertain
him
well
enough
you
always
say
are
not
ceremonious
i
tell
you
what
jog
you
do
think
half
enough
of
yourself
you
are
far
too
easily
set
aside
my
word
but
i
know
some
people
who
would
give
themselves
pretty
airs
if
their
husband
was
chairman
of
a
board
of
guardians
and
trustee
of
i
do
know
how
many
of
her
majesty
turnpike
roads
mrs
jog
here
thinking
of
her
sister
springwheat
who
she
used
to
say
had
married
a
mere
farmer
tell
you
jog
you
far
too
humble
you
do
think
half
enough
of
yourself
but
my
puff
dear
you
do
puff
consider
that
all
people
puff
fond
of
wheeze
children
observed
jogglebury
after
a
pause
i
puff
observed
that
some
wheeze
do
like
them
but
those
will
be
nasty
little
brats
like
james
wakenshaw
or
tom
cheek
but
such
children
as
ours
such
charmers
such
delights
there
is
a
man
in
the
county
from
the
downwards
who
would
be
proud
who
would
think
it
a
compliment
to
be
asked
to
be
to
such
children
i
tell
you
what
jogglebury
crowdey
it
would
be
far
better
to
get
them
rich
and
than
to
leave
them
a
whole
house
full
of
sticks
but
my
puff
dear
the
wheeze
sticks
will
prove
very
wheeze
hereafter
replied
jogglebury
bridling
up
at
the
imputation
on
his
hobby
so
replied
jogglebury
in
a
tone
of
incredulity
but
my
puff
dear
i
wheeze
you
that
they
will
be
indeed
puff
i
may
wheeze
say
that
they
puff
are
it
was
only
the
other
puff
day
that
wheeze
patrick
offered
me
wheeze
shillings
for
my
puff
blackthorn
daniel
which
is
by
no
means
so
puff
good
as
the
wheeze
one
or
indeed
puff
as
the
one
that
i
wheeze
out
of
spankerley
park
have
taken
it
if
i
been
you
observed
jogglebury
he
puff
worth
far
more
retorted
jogglebury
angrily
wheeze
lumpleg
offered
me
as
much
for
disraeli
i
have
taken
it
too
rejoined
jogglebury
i
should
have
wheeze
spoilt
my
puff
set
replied
the
man
any
wheeze
body
was
to
puff
offer
me
five
guineas
a
puff
piece
for
the
puff
pick
of
my
puff
collection
my
puff
wellingtons
my
wheeze
napoleons
my
puff
byrons
my
wheeze
walter
scotts
my
puff
lord
johns
d
think
i
take
it
should
hope
so
replied
jogglebury
should
puff
do
no
such
thing
snorted
her
husband
into
his
frill
should
hope
continued
he
speaking
slowly
and
solemnly
a
puff
wise
ministry
will
purchase

joggle
wiping
a

from
the
corner
of
his

his
a

exclaimed
jogglebury
soothingly
like
a

the
discomfited
diplomatist
well
then
as
we
said
before
when
one
door
shuts
another
opens
and
just
as
puffington
door
was
closing
on
poor
sponge
who
should
cast
up
but
our
newly
introduced
friend
jogglebury
crowdey
sponge
was
sitting
in
solitary
state
in
the
fine
studying
his
old
friend
calculating
what
he
could
ride
from
spur
street
leicester
square
by
short
gardens
and
across
waterloo
bridge
to
the
elephant
and
castle
for
when
the
grinding
of
a
vehicle
on
the
gravelled
ring
attracted
his
attention
looking
out
of
the
window
he
saw
a
horse
head
in
a
bridle
with
the
letters
on
the
winkers
not
writhing
in
the
elegant
contortions
of
modern
science
but
in
the
good
plain
characters
we
have
depicted
above
be
the
doctor
said
sponge
to
himself
as
he
resumed
his
reading
and
calculations
amidst
a
peal
of
the
well
calculated
to
arouse
the
whole
house
a
good
un
to
ring
added
he
looking
up
and
wondering
when
the
last
lingering
tinkle
would
cease
before
the
fact
was
ascertained
there
was
a
hurried
tramp
of
feet
past
the
door
and
presently
the
entrance
one
opened
and
let
in
a
rush
of
wind
sponge
at
home
demanded
a
slow
voice
evidently
from
the
vehicle
was
the
immediate
answer
can
that
be
exclaimed
sponge
pocketing
his
then
there
was
a
creaking
of
springs
and
a
jingling
against
iron
steps
and
presently
a
body
was
heard
crossing
the
while
an
footman
announced
jogglebury
crowdey
leaving
the
owner
to
follow
his
name
at
his
leisure
jogglebury
had
insisted
on
jog
putting
on
his
new
black
frock
a
very
long
coat
fitting
like
a
sack
with
the
pockets
bagging
behind
like
a
poor
man
dinner
wallet
in
lieu
of
the
shrunk
and
darned
white
moleskins
receding
in
apparent
disgust
from
the
dingy
tops
he
had
got
his
nether
man
enveloped
in
a
pair
of
fine
tweeds
with
broad
blue
stripes
down
the
sides
and
shaped
out
over
the
clumsy
foot

jogglebury
introducing
himself
to

he
now
came
waddling
and
labouring
along

hurrying
after
the

and
he
found
himself
in
the
room
servant
sir
said
he
sticking
himself
out
behind
and
addressing
sponge
making
a
ground
sweep
with
his
woolly
hat
said
sponge
with
a
similar
bow

observed
jogglebury
blowing

sponge
adding

gasped
our
visitor
sousing
himself
upon
one
of
the
rosewood
chairs
in
a
way
that
threatened
destruction
to
the
slender
fabric
he
pretty
middling
should
say
replied
sponge
now
making
up
his
mind
that
he
was
addressing
the
doctor
middlin
puff
repeated
jogglebury
blowing
into
his
frill
middlin

i
that
means

got

my
third
wheeze
girl
margaret
henrietta
has
one
you
want
to
see
him
asked
sponge
after
a
pause
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
his
friend
conversation
had
come
to
a
period
or
full
stop
replied
jogglebury
unconcernedly
i
leave
a
puff
card
for
him
wheeze
added
he
fumbling
in
his
wallet
behind
for
his
puff
object
is
to
pay
my
wheeze
respects
to
you
observed
he
drawing
a
great
carved
indian
case
from
his
pocket
and
pulling
off
the
top
with
a
noise
like
the
drawing
of
a
cork
obliged
for
the
compliment
observed
sponge
as
jogglebury
fumbled
and
broke
his
nails
in
attempting
to
get
a
card
out
you
stay
long
in
this
part
of
the
world
asked
he
as
at
last
he
succeeded
and
commenced
tapping
the
corners
of
the
card
on
the
table
really
do
know
replied
sponge
as
the
particulars
of
his
situation
flashed
across
his
mind
could
this
man
be
a
chap
puffington
had
got
to
come
and
sound
him
thought
he
jogglebury
sat
silent
for
a
time
examining
his
feet
attentively
as
if
to
see
they
were
pairs
and
scrutinizing
the
bags
of
his
trousers
was
going
to
say
hem
cough
hem
at
length
observed
he
looking
up
to
say
i
was
thinking
hem
wheeze
cough
hem
or
rather
i
should
say
jogglebury
crowdey
sent
me
to
say

mean

continued
he
stamping
one
of
his
ponderous
feet
against
the
floor
as
if
to
force
out
his
words
jogglebury
crowdey
and
i
would
be
glad
happy
that
to
say
hem
if
you
would
arrange
hem
to

pay
us
a
visit
hem

i
sure
exclaimed
sponge
jumping
at
the
offer

go

continued
our
visitor
taking
up
the
sentence
where
sponge
had
interrupted
him
hem
live
about
nine
miles
hem
from
here
hem
there

jogglebury

and
that
give
our
friend
here
time
to
come
round
but
puff
wheeze
gasp
started
jogglebury
the
blood
rushing
to
his
great
yellow
whiskerless
cheeks
not
quite
gasp
sure
that
gasp
jogglebury
puff
crowdey
would
be
puff
wheeze
gasp
prepared
preparation
interrupted
sponge
take
you
as
you
are
never

me
i
hate

made
company
of
just
treat
me
like
one
of
yourselves
and
rabbits
and
onions
anything
nothing
comes
amiss
to
me
so
saying
and
while
jogglebury
sat
purple
and
unable
to
articulate
sponge
applied
his
hand
to
the
ivory
and
sounded
an
imposing
peal
jogglebury
sat
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
and
thinking
what
a
wigging
he
would
get
from
if
he
did
manage
to
shake
off
his
friend
above
all
he
recollected
that
they
had
nothing
but
haddocks
and
hashed
mutton
for
dinner
leather
i
want
him
said
sponge
in
a
tone
of
authority
as
the
footman
answered
the
summons
then
turning
to
his
guest
as
the
man
was
leaving
the
room
he
said
you
take
something
after
your
drive
cold
meat
glass
of
sherry
bottled
porter
anything
in
that
line
in
an
ordinary
way
jogglebury
would
have
said
you
please
at
the
sound
of
the
words
meat
for
he
was
a
dead
hand
at
luncheon
but
the
fix
he
was
in
completely
took
away
his
appetite
and
he
sat
wheezing
and
thinking
whether
to
make
another
effort
or
to
wait
the
arrival
of
leather
presently
leather
appeared
and
gaitered
smoothing
his
hair
over
his
forehead
after
the
manner
of
the
brotherhood
said
sponge
in
the
same
tone
of
importance
going
to
this
gentleman
for
as
yet
he
had
not
sufficiently
mastered
the
name
to
be
able
to
venture
upon
it
in
the
owner
presence
i
going
to
this
gentleman
and
i
want
you
to
bring
me
a
horse
over
in
the
morning
or
stay
said
he
interrupting
himself
and
turning
to
jogglebury
he
exclaimed
dare
say
you
could
manage
to
put
me
up
a
couple
of
horses
could
you
and
then
we
should
be
all
cosy
and
jolly
together
you
know
my
word
gasped
jogglebury
nearly
choked
by
the
proposal
my
word
i
can
hardly
puff
say
i
hardly
wheeze
know
but
if
puff
wheeze
allow
me
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
puff
wheeze
home
and
see
what
i
can
puff
do
in
the
way
of
entertainment
for
puff
wheeze
man
as
well
as
for
puff
wheeze
horse
my
dear
fellow
exclaimed
sponge
seeing
the
intended
dodge
my
dear
fellow
repeated
he
that
giving
you
too
much
trouble
too
much
trouble
could
think
of
such
a
thing
no
indeed
i
could
tell
you
what
we
do
tell
you
what
we
do
you
shall
drive
me
over
in
that
thing
of
yours
sponge
looking
out
of
the
window
as
he
spoke
at
the
vehicle
with
a
turnover
seat
behind
now
in
charge
of
a
attired
youth
with
a
shabby
hat
looped
up
by
a
thin
silver
cord
to
an
acorn
on
the
crown
and
baggy
berlin
gloves
i
just
see
what
there
is
in
the
way
of
stabling
and
if
i
think
it
will
do
then
i
give
a
boy
sixpence
or
a
shilling
to
come
over
to
leather
here
jerking
his
head
towards
his
factotum
it
wo
do
why
then
shall
want
stalls
sir
recollect
sir
leather
who
did
not
wish
to
move
his
quarters
i
forgot
replied
sponge
with
a
frown
at
his
officiousness
if
we
can
get
two
good
stalls
for
the
hunters
said
he
manage
the
hack
somehow
or
other
replied
leather
in
a
tone
of
resignation
knowing
how
hopeless
it
was
arguing
with
his
master
really
think
gasped
jogglebury
crowdey
encouraged
by
the
apparent
sympathy
of
the
servant
to
make
a
last
effort
really
think
repeated
he
as
the
hashed
mutton
and
haddocks
again
flashed
across
his
mind
my
puff
wheeze
plan
is
the
puff
best
let
me
puff
wheeze
home
and
see
how
all
puff
wheeze
things
are
and
then
i
write
you
a
puff
wheeze
line
or
send
a
puff
wheeze
servant
over
no
replied
sponge
no
that
far
too
much
trouble
i
just
go
over
with
you
now
and
reconnoitre
afraid
puff
wheeze
crowdey
will
hardly
be
prepared
for
puff
wheeze
visitors
ejaculated
our
friend
recollecting
it
was
and
that
mary
ann
would
be
wanted
in
the
laundry
mention
it
exclaimed
sponge
mention
it
i
hate
to
be
made
company
of
just
give
me
what
you
have
yourselves
just
give
me
what
you
have
yourselves
where
two
can
dine
three
can
dine
you
know
jogglebury
crowdey
was
nonplussed
now
said
sponge
turning
again
to
leather
go
upstairs
and
help
me
to
pack
up
my
things
and
addressing
himself
to
our
visitor
he
said
you
amuse
yourself
with
the
paper
the
or
i
lend
you
my
continued
he
offering
the
little
volume
as
he
spoke
replied
jogglebury
who
was
still
tapping
away
at
the
card
which
he
had
now
worked
very
soft
sponge
then
left
him
with
the
volume
in
his
hand
and
proceeded
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
the
vehicle
was
got
under
way
jogglebury
crowdey
and
sponge
occupying
the
roomy
seats
in
front
and
bartholomew
badger
the
tiger
and
sponge
portmanteau
and
being
in
the
very
diminutive
turnover
seat
behind
the
carriage
was
followed
by
the
straining
eyes
of
sundry
johns
and
janes
who
unanimously
agreed
that
sponge
was
the
meanest
shabbiest
gent
they
had
ever
had
in
house
leather
was
therefore
roasted
in
the
servants
hall
where
the
sins
of
the
masters
are
oft
visited
upon
the
servants
but
to
our
travellers
little
conversation
passed
between
our
friends
for
the
first
few
miles
for
in
addition
to
the
road
being
rough
the
was
so
high
and
the
other
so
low
that
jogglebury
crowdey
parables
broke
against
sponge
instead
of
dropping
into
his
ear
besides
which
the
unwilling
host
mind
was
a
good
deal
occupied
with
wishing
that
there
had
been
three
haddocks
instead
of
two
and
speculating
whether
crowdey
would
be
more
pleased
at
the
success
of
his
mission
or
put
out
of
her
way
by
sponge
unexpected
coming
above
all
he
had
marked
some
very
sticks
two
blackthorns
and
a
holly
to
cut
on
his
way
home
and
he
was
intent
on
not
missing
them
so
sudden
was
the
jerk
that
announced
his
coming
on
the
first
one
as
nearly
to
throw
the
old
family
horse
on
his
knees
and
almost
to
break
sponge
nose
against
the
brass
edge
of
the
ere
sponge
recovered
his
equilibrium
the
whip
was
in
the
case
the
reins
dangling
about
the
old
screw
heels
and
crowdey
scrambling
up
a
steep
bank
to
where
a
very
thick
shut
out
the
view
of
the
adjacent
country
presently
chop
chop
chop
was
heard
from
crowdey
pocket
axe
with
a
tug
wheeze
puff
from
himself
next
a
crash
of
separation
and
then
the
crowdey
came
bearing
down
the
bank
dragging
a
great
blackthorn
bush
after
him
have
you
got
there
inquired
sponge
with
surprise
wheeze
puff
wheeze
replied
crowdey
pulling
up
short
and
mopping
his
perspiring
brow
with
a
great
bandana
i
puff
wheeze
got
what
i
wheeze
think
will
puff
into
a
most
elaborate
and
wheeze
valuable
this
i
puff

continued
he
eyeing
the
great
ball
with
which
he
had
got
it
up
wheeze
come
in
most
valuably
puff
for
my
great
puff

asked
sponge
astonished
at
his
vehemence
puff
wheeze
gasp
have
you
heard
exclaimed
jogglebury
taking
off
his
great
woolly
hat
and
giving
his
lank
dark
hair
streaked
with
grey
a
sweep
round
his
low
forehead
with
the
bandana
puff
gasp
have
you
heard
repeated
he
getting
a
little
more
breath
wheeze
undertaking
a
series
of
gasp
sticks
representing
gasp
immortalizing
i
may
say
puff
all
the
wheeze
crowned
heads
of
england
puff
replied
sponge
be
a
most
valuable
collection
wheeze
puff
continued
jogglebury
still
eyeing
the
knob
added
he
be
william
the
fourth
he
then
commenced
lopping
and
docking
the
sides
making
bartholomew
badger
bury
them
in
a
hard
by
observing
in
a
confidential
wheeze
to
sponge
he
had
once
been
for
a
similar
trespass
before
the
top
and
lop
being
at
length
disposed
of
crowdey
grasping
the
struck
the
other
forcibly
against
the
ground
exclaiming
there
a
puff
stick
who
knows
what
that
puff
wheeze
stick
may
be
worth
some
day
he
then
bundled
into
his
carriage
and
drove
on
two
more
stoppages
marked
their
arrival
at
the
other
sticks
which
being
duly
captured
and
fastened
within
the
straps
of
the
crowdey
drove
on
somewhat
more
at
ease
in
his
mind
at
all
events
somewhat
comforted
at
the
thoughts
of
having
increased
his
wealth
he
did
not
become
talkative
indeed
that
was
not
his
forte
but
he
puffed
into
his
and
made
a
few
observations
which
if
they
did
not
possess
much
originality
at
all
events
showed
that
he
was
not
asleep
are
said
he
after
a
hearty
stare
at
a
then
about
five
minutes
after
he
blew
again
and
said
do
think
puff
that
wheeze
draining
without
gasp
manuring
will
constitute
high
farming
puff
so
he
jolted
and
wheezed
and
jerked
and
jagged
the
old
quadruped
mouth
occasionally
hissing
between
his
teeth
and
stamping
against
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
when
other
persuasive
efforts
failed
to
induce
it
to
keep
up
the
semblance
of
a
trot
at
last
the
hobble
died
out
into
a
walk
and
crowdey
complacently
dropping
his
fat
hand
on
his
fat
knees
seemed
to
resign
himself
to
his
fate
so
they
crawled
along
the
piece
of
road
below
poplarton
plantations
jogglebury
keeping
a
sharp
eye
upon
the
underwood
for
sticks
after
passing
these
they
commenced
the
gradual
ascent
of
roundington
hill
when
a
sudden
sweep
of
the
road
brought
them
in
view
of
the
panorama
of
the
rich
vale
of
butterflower
a
box
observed
sponge
as
he
at
length
espied

crowdey
slowly
and
pompously
adding
an

to
make
it
sound
better
the

mutton
and
all
the
horrors
of
impromptu
hospitality
rushing
upon
his

things
began
to
look
worse
the
nearer
he
got
home
he
did
care
to
aggravate
the
old
animal
into
a
trot
he
again
wondered
whether
would
be
pleased
at
the
success
of
his

angry
at

brightening
up
thinking
there
would
be
old
hay
and
corn
they
now
came
to
a
little
cottage
of
a
lodge
and
the

turned
instinctively
into
the

with

jogglebury
convulsively
as
a
tall
woman
in

and
yellow

with
a
swarm
of
little
children
similarly
attired
suddenly
appeared
at
an

exclaimed
she
as

repeated
she
in
a
sharper

holding
her

across
the

but
taking
no

of
our

who
in
truth
she
took
for

he
winking
his

motioning
with
his

finding
himself
in
the

of
his
handsome
hostess

made
her
one
of
his
best
bows
and
offered
to
resign
his
seat
in
the
carriage
to
her
this
she
declined
alleging
that
she
had
the
children
with
her
looking
round
on
the
grinning
gaping
group
the
majority
of
them
with
their
mouths
smeared
with
lollipops
crowdey
who
was
not
so
stupid
as
he
looked
was
nettled
at
sponge
attempting
to
fix
his
wife
upon
him
at
such
a
critical
moment
and
immediately
retaliated
with
puff

to
puff
out
and

walk
there

no

for

to

gave

with

two

with

jingled
away
with
a
bevy
of

shouting

from

husband
observed
sponge
as
he
now
overtook
his
hostess
and
proceeded
with
her
towards
the
house
insisted
upon
bringing
me
over
to
spend
a
few
days
till
my

puffington
recovers
he
just
got
the
gout
i
said
i
was
it
might
be
quite
convenient
to
you
but
crowdey
assured
me
you
were
in
the
habit
of
receivin
at
short
notice
and
so
i
have
taken
him
at
his
word
you
see
and
come
jogglebury
who
was
still
out
of
wind
from
her
run
after
the
carriage
assured
him
that
she
was
extremely
happy
to
see
him
though
she
help
thinking
what
a
noodle
jog
was
to
bring
a
stranger
on
a
that
however
was
a
point
she
would
reserve
for
jog
just
then
a
loud
outburst
from
the
children
announced
the
approach
of
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
in
the
person
of
gustavus
james
in
the
arms
with
a
curly
blue
feather
nodding
over
his
nose
black
eyes
brightened
with
delight
as
she
ran
forward
to
meet
him
and
in
her
mind
eye
she
saw
him
inheriting
a
splendid
mansion
with
a
retinue
of
powdered
footmen
in
liveries
and
broad
hats
great
prospectively
great
at
least
as
had
been
her
successes
in
the
sponsor
line
with
her
other
children
she
really
thought
getting
sponge
for
a
for
gustavus
james
eclipsed
all
her
other
doings
sponge
having
been
liberal
in
his
admiration
of
the
other
children
of
course
could
not
refuse
unbounded
applause
to
the
evident
object
of
a
mother
regards
and
chucking
the
young
gentleman
under
his
double
chin
asked
him
how
he
was
and
said
something
about
something
he
had
in
his
alluding
to
a
paper
of
cheap
comfits
he
had
bought
at
sugarchalk
the
confectioner
sale
in
oxford
street
and
which
he
carried
about
for
contingencies
like
the
present
this
pleased
crowdey
looking
as
she
thought
as
if
he
had
come
predetermined
to
do
what
she
wanted
amidst
praises
and
stories
of
the
prodigy
they
reached
the
house
if
a
means
a
house
with
an
puddingpote
bower
did
not
aspire
to
be
one
a
visitor
dived
medias
into
the
passage
at
once
in
it
stood
an
family
clock
and
a
large
with
an
stuffed
cat
on
an
imitation
marble
slab
underneath
the
slab
indeed
all
about
the
passage
were
scattered
children
hats
and
caps
hoops
tops
spades
and
mutilated
toys
spotted
horses
without
heads
soldiers
without
arms
windmills
without
sails
and
wheelbarrows
without
wheels
in
a
corner
were
a
bunch
of
in
the
rough
and
alongside
the
hung
jog
formidable
flail
of
a
sponge
found
his
portmanteau
standing
bolt
upright
in
the
passage
with
the
bag
alongside
of
it
just
as
they
had
been
chucked
out
of
the
phaeton
by
bartholomew
badger
who
having
got
orders
to
put
the
horse
right
and
then
to
put
himself
right
to
wait
at
dinner
jogglebury
proceeded
to
vociferate
ann
murry
ann
in
such
a
way
that
mary
ann
thought
either
that
the
cat
had
got
young
crowdey
or
the
house
was
on
fire
murry
ann
exclaimed
jogglebury
as
she
came
darting
into
the
passage
from
the
back
settlements
up
to
the
elbows
in
want
you
to
puff
upstairs
with
me
and
help
to
get
my
wheeze
out
of
the
best
room
there
a
puff
gentleman
coming
to
wheeze
here
indeed
sir
replied
mary
ann
smiling
and
dropping
down
her
sleeves
glad
to
find
it
was
no
worse
they
then
proceeded
upstairs
together
all
the
were
bundled
out
both
the
finished
ones
that
were
varnished
and
laid
away
carefully
in
the
wardrobe
and
those
that
were
undergoing
surgical
treatment
in
the
way
of
twistings
and
bendings
and
tyings
in
the
closets
as
they
routed
them
out
of
hole
and
corner
jogglebury
kept
up
a
sort
of
running
recommendation
to
mercy
mingled
with
an
inquiry
into
the
state
of
the
household
affairs
puff
murry
ann
exclaimed
he
care
you
do
scratch
that
puff
franky
burdett
handing
her
a
highly
varnished
oak
stick
with
the
head
of
sir
francis
for
a
handle
how
many
gasp
haddocks
d
say
there
are
in
the
house
sir
replied
mary
ann
repeated
he
with
an
emphasis
thought
your
gasp
missus
told
me
there
were
but
puff
two
and
murry
ann
you
must
put
the
new
puff
quilt
on
the
gasp
bed
and
puff
just
look
under
it
gasp
and
find
the
puff
old
truro
rolled
up
in
a
dirty
puff
pocket
hankercher
and
murry
ann
d
think
the
new
wheeze
purtaters
came
that
i
bought
of
puff
billy
bloxom
if
so
you
better
puff
some
for
dinner
and
get
the
best
wheeze
decanters
out
and
murry
ann
there
are
two
gibbeys
on
the
puff
surbase
at
the
back
of
the
bed
which
you
may
as
well
puff
away
ah
here
he
is
added
jogglebury
as
sponge
voice
rose
now
from
the
passage
into
the
room
above
things
now
looked
pretty
promising
sponge
attentions
to
the
children
generally
and
to
gustavus
james
in
particular
coupled
with
his
mode
of
introducing
himself
made
crowdey
feel
far
more
at
her
ease
with
regard
to
entertaining
him
than
she
would
have
done
if
her
neighbour
makepeace
or
the
rev
facey
himself
had
dropped
in
to
take
luck
as
they
called
it
with
either
of
these
she
would
have
wished
to
appear
as
if
their
form
was
more
in
accordance
with
their
company
style
whereas
jog
and
she
wanted
to
get
something
out
of
sponge
instead
of
electrifying
him
with
their
grandeur
that
gustavus
james
was
destined
for
greatness
she
had
not
the
least
doubt
she
began
to
think
whether
it
might
not
be
advisable
to
call
him
gustavus
james
sponge
jog
too
was
comforted
at
hearing
there
were
three
haddocks
for
though
hospitably
inclined
he
did
not
at
all
like
the
idea
of
being
on
short
commons
himself
he
had
sufficient
confidence
in
management
especially
as
the
guest
was
of
her
own
seeking
to
know
that
she
would
make
up
a
tolerable
dinner
illustration
nor
was
he
out
of
his
reckoning
for
at
five
bartholomew
announced
dinner
when
in
sailed
crowdey
fresh
from
the
composition
of
it
and
from
the
becoming
revision
of
her
own
dress
instead
of
the
loose
flowing
gipsified
stunner
tartan
of
the
morning
she
was
attired
in
a
french
grey
silk
showing
as
well
the
fulness
and
whiteness
of
her
exquisite
bust
as
the
beautiful
formation
of
her
arms
her
raven
hair
was
ably
parted
and
flattened
on
either
side
of
her
head
sponge
felt
proud
of
the
honour
of
having
such
a
fine
creature
on
his
arm
and
kicked
about
in
his
tights
more
than
usual
the
dinner
though
it
might
show
symptoms
of
hurry
was
yet
plentiful
and
good
of
its
kind
and
if
bartholomew
had
not
been
always
getting
in
murry
ann
way
would
have
been
well
set
on
and
served
jog
quaffed
quantities
of
foaming
bottled
porter
during
the
progress
of
it
and
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
at
the
end
as
if
thoroughly
overcome
with
his
exertions
scarcely
were
the
wine
and
dessert
set
on
ere
a
violent
outbreak
in
the
nursery
caused
crowdey
to
hurry
away
leaving
sponge
to
enjoy
the
company
of
her
husband
drink
puff
i
observed
jog
after
a
pause
helping
himself
to
a
bumper
of
port
and
passing
the
bottle
to
sponge
all
my
heart
replied
our
hero
filling
up
puff
wheeze
amusement
observed
crowdey
with
a
yawn
after
another
pause
and
beating
the
devil
tattoo
upon
the
table
to
keep
himself
awake
replied
sponge
wondering
how
such
a
chap
as
jog
managed
to
partake
of
it
puff
wheeze
appetizer
observed
jogglebury
after
another
pause
is
replied
sponge
presently
jog
began
to
snore
and
as
the
increasing
melody
of
his
nose
gave
little
hopes
of
returning
animation
sponge
had
recourse
to
his
old
friend
and
amidst
speculations
as
to
time
and
distances
managed
to
finish
the
port
we
will
now
pass
to
the
next
morning
whatever
deficiency
there
might
be
at
dinner
was
amply
atoned
for
at
breakfast
which
was
both
good
and
abundant
bread
and
cake
of
all
sorts
eggs
muffins
toast
honey
jellies
and
preserves
without
end
on
the
was
a
dish
of
hot
kidneys
and
a
magnificent
red
ham
but
a
greater
treat
far
as
jogglebury
thought
was
in
the
guests
set
around
there
were
arranged
all
her
tulips
in
succession
beginning
with
that
greatest
of
all
wonders
gustavus

and
running
on
with
anna

down
to
peter

the
heir
who
sat
next
his

these
formed
a
close
line
on
the
side
of
the
table
opposite
the
fire
that
side
being
left
for
sponge
all
the
children
had
clean
pinafores
on
and
their
hairs
plastered
according
to
nursery
regulation
sponge
appearance
was
a
signal
for
silence
and
they
all
sat
staring
at
him
in
mute
astonishment
baby
gustavus
james
did
more
for
after
reconnoitring
him
through
a
sort
of
lattice
window
formed
of
his
fingers
he
whined
out
that
man
ma
amidst
the
titter
of
the
rest
of
the
line
my
dear
exclaimed
crowdey
hoping
sponge
had
heard
but
gustavus
james
was
not
to
be
put
down
and
he
renewed
the
charge
as
his
mamma
began
pouring
out
the
tea
that
man
away
ma
whined
he
in
a
louder
tone
at
which
all
the
children
burst
out
puff
gustavus

exclaimed
jog
knocking
with
the
handle
of
his
knife
against
the
table
and
frowning
at
the
prodigy
pa
he
a
man
replied
the
child
amid
the
laughter
of
the
rest
but
what
have
got
exclaimed
sponge
producing
a
gaudily
paper
of
comfits
from
his
pocket
opening
and
distributing
the
unwholesome
contents
along
the
line
stopping
the
orator
mouth
first
with
a
great
almond
comfit
breakfast
was
then
proceeded
with
without
further
difficulty
as
it
drew
to
a
close
and
sponge
began
nibbling
at
the
sweets
instead
of
continuing
his
attack
on
the
solids
jogglebury
began
eyeing
and
telegraphing
her
husband
my
dear
said
she
looking
significantly
at
him
and
then
at
the
which
still
contained
three
eggs
my
dear
replied
jog
with
a
vacant
stare
pretending
not
to
understand
better
eat
them
said
she
looking
again
at
the
eggs
puff
breakfasted
my
wheeze
dear
replied
jog
pompously
wiping
his
mouth
on
his
bandana
be
wasted
if
you
do
replied
mrs
jog
but
they
be
wasted
if
i
eat
them
without
wheeze
wanting
them
rejoined
he
jog
you
always
say
that
retorted
his
wife
puff
nonsense
wheeze
i
say
they
say
they
replied
mrs
jog
will
they
mr
sponge
continued
she
appealing
to
our
friend
no
not
so
much
as
if
they
went
out
replied
our
friend
thinking
mrs
jog
was
the
one
to
side
with
you
better
puff
wheeze
gasp
eat
them
between
you
replied
jog
getting
up
and
strutting
out
of
the
room
presently
he
appeared
in
front
of
the
house
crowned
in
a
with
a
gibbey
in
his
hand
and
as
sponge
did
not
want
to
offend
him
and
moreover
wanted
to
get
his
horses
billeted
on
him
he
presently
made
an
excuse
for
joining
him
although
his
horses
were
standing
gratis
as
he
called
it
at
puffington
and
though
he
would
have
thought
nothing
of
making
leather
come
over
with
one
each
hunting
morning
still
he
felt
that
if
the
hounds
were
much
on
the
other
side
of
puddingpote
bower
it
would
not
be
so
convenient
as
having
them
there
despite
the
egg
controversy
he
thought
a
judicious
application
of
soft
sawder
might
accomplish
what
he
wanted
at
all
events
he
would
try
jog
had
brought
himself
short
up
and
was
standing
glowering
with
his
hands
in
his
as
if
he
had
never
seen
the
place
before
you
have
here
jogglebury
observed
sponge
joining
him
replied
jog
still
cogitating
the
egg
question
and
thinking
he
would
have
so
many
boiled
the
next
day
yours
asked
sponge
waving
his
hand
as
he
spoke
puff
goes
up
to
those
wheeze
firs
in
the
on
the
hill
replied
jogglebury
pompously
said
sponge
are
fine
trees
thinking
what
a
finish
they
would
make
for
a
puff
uncle
crowdey
planted
those
wheeze
trees
observed
jog
observe
added
he
it
is
easier
to
cut
down
a
puff
tree
than
to
make
it
wheeze
again
believe
you
right
replied
sponge
idea
has
struck
me
very
often
it
replied
jog
puffing
voluminously
into
his
frill
they
then
advanced
a
few
paces
and
leaning
on
the
iron
hurdles
commenced
staring
at
the
cows
are
the
stables
at
last
asked
sponge
seeing
no
inclination
to
move
on
the
part
of
his
host
wheeze
stables
puff
replied
jogglebury
recollecting
sponge
previous
day
proposal
wheeze
are
behind
said
he
the
back
there
puff
nothin
to
see
at
them
wheeze
be
the
horse
you
drove
yesterday
wo
you
go
to
see
how
he
is
asked
sponge
sure
to
be
well
puff
never
nothing
the
matter
with
him
wheeze
replied
jogglebury
as
well
see
rejoined
sponge
turning
up
a
narrow
walk
that
seemed
to
lead
to
the
back
jog
followed
doggedly
he
had
a
good
deal
of
john
bull
in
him
and
did
not
fancy
being
taken
possession
of
in
that
sort
of
way
and
thought
moreover
that
sponge
had
not
behaved
very
well
in
the
matter
of
the
egg
controversy
the
stables
certainly
were
nothing
to
boast
of
they
were
in
an
old
building
without
even
the
delicacy
of
a
ceiling
nevertheless
there
was
plenty
of
room
even
after
jogglebury
had
cut
off
one
end
for
a
you
might
hunt
the
country
with
all
this
stabling
observed
sponge
as
he
entered
the
low
door
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
nine
stalls
i
declare
added
he
after
counting
them
puff
uncle
used
to
wheeze
a
good
deal
of
his
own
puff
land
replied
jogglebury
well
i
tell
you
what
these
stables
will
be
much
better
for
being
occupied
observed
sponge
i
tell
you
what
i
do
for
you
they
occupied
gasped
jogglebury
convulsively
half
replied
sponge
a
quarter
i
may
say
not
even
that
indeed
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
have
my
horses
over
here
and
you
shall
find
them
in
straw
in
return
for
the
manure
and
just
charge
me
for
hay
and
corn
at
market
price
you
know
that
make
it
all
square
and
fair
and
no
obligation
you
know
i
hate
obligations
added
he
eyeing
jog
disconcerted
face
but
puff
wheeze
gasp
exclaimed
jogglebury
reddening
up
do
puff
know
that
i
can
gasp
that
i
mean
puff
that
this
wheeze
stable
is
all
the
gasp
i
have
and
if
we
had
puff
company
or
gasp
anything
of
that
sort
i
do
know
where
we
should
wheeze
their
horses
continued
he
i
do
puff
wheeze
know
about
the
market
price
of
gasp
corn
my
wheeze
tenant
tom
hayrick
at
the
puff
farm
on
the
wheeze
hill
yonder
supplies
me
with
the
puff
quantity
i
wheeze
want
and
we
just
puff
wheeze
gasp
settle
once
a
puff
or
so
i
see
replied
sponge
mean
to
say
you
would
know
how
to
strike
the
average
so
as
to
say
what
i
ought
to
pay
so
rejoined
jogglebury
jumping
at
the
idea
well
said
sponge
in
a
tone
of
indifference
no
great
odds
it
no
great
odds
more
the
name
of
the
thing
than
anything
else
one
likes
to
be
independent
you
know
one
likes
to
be
independent
but
as
i
sha
be
with
you
long
i
just
put
up
with
it
for
once
i
just
put
up
with
it
for
once
and
let
you
find
me
and
let
you
find
me
so
saying
he
walked
away
leaving
jogglebury
petrified
at
his
impudence
husband
of
yours
is
a
monstrous
good
fellow
observed
sponge
to
jogglebury
who
he
now
met
coming
out
with
her
tail
insist
on
my
having
my
horses
over
here
most
liberal
handsome
thing
of
him
sure
and
that
reminds
me
can
you
manage
to
put
up
my
servant
dare
say
we
can
replied
jogglebury
thoughtfully
not
a
very
fine
gentleman
is
he
asked
she
knowing
that
servants
were
often
more
difficult
to
please
than
their
masters
not
at
all
replied
sponge
at
all
would
suit
me
if
he
was
would
suit
me
if
he
was
just
then
up
waddled
jogglebury
puffing
and
wheezing
like
a
stranded
grampus
the
idea
having
just
struck
him
that
he
might
get
off
on
the
plea
of
not
having
room
for
the
servant
very
unfortunate
wheeze
that
to
say
it
never
occurred
to
me
puff
but
i
quite
forgot
gasp
that
we
have
wheeze
room
for
your
puff
servant
you
are
a
good
fellow
replied
sponge
devilish
good
fellow
i
was
just
telling
jogglebury
was
i
mrs
jogglebury
what
an
excellent
fellow
you
are
and
how
kind
you
been
about
the
horses
and
corn
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
be
convenient
to
put
up
a
servant
but
your
wife
assures
me
that
it
will
so
that
settles
the
matter
you
know
that
settles
the
matter
and
i
now
send
for
the
horses
forthwith
jog
was
utterly
disconcerted
and
did
know
which
way
to
turn
for
an
excuse
jogglebury
though
she
would
rather
have
been
without
the
establishment
did
not
like
to
peril
gustavus
james
prospects
by
appearing
displeased
so
she
smilingly
said
she
would
see
and
do
what
they
could
sponge
then
procured
a
messenger
to
take
a
note
to
hanby
house
for
leather
and
having
written
it
amused
himself
for
a
time
with
his
cigars
and
his
in
his
bedroom
and
then
turned
out
to
see
the
stable
got
ready
and
pick
up
any
information
about
the
hounds
or
anything
else
from
anybody
he
could
lay
hold
of
as
luck
would
have
it
he
fell
in
with
a
groom
travelling
a
horse
to
hunt
with
sir
harry
scattercash
hounds
which
he
said
met
at
snobston
green
some
eight
or
nine
miles
off
the
next
day
and
whither
sponge
decided
on
going
jogglebury
equanimity
returning
at
dinner
time
sponge
was
persuasive
enough
to
induce
him
to
accompany
him
and
it
was
finally
arranged
that
leather
should
go
on
with
the
horses
and
jog
should
drive
sponge
to
cover
in
the
chapter
xlvii
a
family
breakfast
on
a
hunting
morning
illustration
jogglebury
crowdey
was
a
good
deal
disconcerted
at
gustavus
irreverence
to
his
intended
and
did
her
best
both
by
promises
and
entreaties
to
bring
him
to
a
more
becoming
state
of
mind
she
promised
him
abundance
of
good
things
if
he
would
astonish
sponge
with
some
of
his
wonderful
stories
and
expatiated
on
sponge
goodness
in
bringing
him
the
nice
comfits
though
jogglebury
could
not
but
in
her
heart
blame
them
for
some
little
internal
inconvenience
the
wonder
had
experienced
during
the
night
however
she
brought
him
to
breakfast
in
pretty
good
form
where
he
was
cocked
up
in
his
high
chair
beside
his
mamma
the
rest
of
the
infantry
occupying
the
position
of
the
previous
day
all
under
orders
unfortunately
sponge
not
having
been
able
to
get
himself
up
to
his
satisfaction
was
late
in
coming
down
and
when
he
did
make
his
appearance
the
unusual
sight
of
a
man
in
a
red
coat
a
green
tie
a
blue
vest
brown
boots
completely
upset
their
propriety
and
deranged
the
order
of
the
young
gentleman
performance
sponge
too
conscious
that
he
was
late
was
more
eager
for
his
breakfast
than
anxious
to
be
astonished
so
what
with
repressing
the
demands
of
the
youngster
watching
that
the
others
did
not
break
loose
and
getting
jog
and
sponge
what
they
wanted
crowdey
had
her
hands
full
at
last
having
got
them
set
she
took
a
lump
of
sugar
out
of
the
basin
and
showing
it
to
the
wonder
laid
it
beside
her
plate
whispering
my
beauty
into
his
ear
as
she
adjusted
him
in
his
chair
the
child
who
had
been
wound
up
like
a
musical
then
went
off
as
follows
bah

i
three
bags
full
un
for
ye
master
un
for
ye
dame
un
for
ye
boy
about

but
unfortunately
sponge
was
busy
with
his
breakfast
and
the
prodigy
wasted
his
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
jogglebury
who
had
sat
listening
in
ecstasies
saw
the
offended
eye
and
pouting
lip
of
the
boy
and
attempted
to
make
up
with
exclamations
of
a
clever
fellow
that
a
wonder
at
the
same
time
showing
him
the
sugar
little
more
puff
tea
my
wheeze
dear
said
jogglebury
thrusting
his
great
cup
up
the
table
jog
hush
exclaimed
crowdey
holding
up
her
forefinger
and
looking
significantly
first
at
him
and
then
at
the
urchin
obin
and
ichard
my
darling
continued
she
addressing
herself
coaxingly
to
gustavus
james
obin
and
ichard
replied
the
child
peevishly
my
darling

interposed
jogglebury
knocking
with
his
knuckles
on
the
table

replied
jogglebury
snappishly
but

snobston

jogglebury

replied
sponge
eating
away
crowdey

only

jogglebury
crowdey
then
prepared
to
pour
her
husband
out
another
cup
of
tea
and
the
musical
being
now
left
to
itself
went
off
of
its
own
accord
with
diddle
doubt
my
candle
out
my
dame

delighted
and
found
herself
pouring
the

jogglebury
tartly

jogglebury
slowly
and
solemnly
with

into

our

they

jogglebury
crowdey
necessarily
mistress
jogglebury
crowdey
replied
the
pertinacious
jog
with
another
heavy
snort
now
you
coming
your
fine
guardian
knowledge
rejoined
his
wife
jog
was
chairman
of
the
union
while
this
was
going
on
young
hopeful
was
sitting
cocked
up
in
his
high
chair
evidently
mortified
at
the
want
of
attention
crowdey
saw
how
things
were
going
and
turning
from
the
cow
question
endeavoured
to
him
in
his
recitations
my
angel
exclaimed
she
again
showing
him
the
sugar
us
about
obin
and
ichard
not
obin
and
ichard
pouted
the
child
yes

the
pretty
coat
who

the
nice
things

to
hear

out
with
it
young
man
exclaimed
sponge
now
putting
a
large
piece
of
cold
beef
into
his
mouth
a
man
muttered
the
child
bursting
out
and
extending
his
little
fat
arms
to
his
mamma
my
angel
not
a
man
yet
replied
jogglebury
taking
him
out
of
the
chair
and
hugging
him
to
her
bosom
be
a
man
before
his
mother
for
all
that
observed
sponge
nothing
disconcerted
by
the
noise
jog
had
now
finished
his
breakfast
and
having
pocketed
three
buns
and
two
pieces
of
toast
with
a
thick
layer
of
cold
ham
between
them
looked
at
his
great
of
a
watch
and
said
to
his
guest
you
wheeze
i
puff
so
saying
he
got
up
and
gave
his
great
legs
one
or
two
convulsive
shakes
as
if
to
see
that
they
were
on
jogglebury
looked
reproachfully
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
you
behave
so
sponge
as
he
eyed
jog
queerly
put
on
garments
wished
that
he
had
not
desired
leather
to
go
to
the
meet
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
got
the
horses
a
little
way
off
and
have
shirked
jog
who
did
not
look
like
a
desirable
introducer
to
a
hunting
field
be
with
you
directly
replied
sponge
gulping
down
the
remains
of
his
tea
adding
just
got
to
run
upstairs
and
get
a
cigar
so
saying
he
jumped
up
and
disappeared
murry
ann
not
approving
of
sponge
smoking
in
his
bedroom
had
hid
the
under
the
toilet
cover
at
the
back
of
the
glass
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
found
it
jogglebury
availed
herself
of
the
lapse
of
time
and
his
absence
to
pacify
her
young
turk
and
try
to
coax
him
into
reciting
the
marvellous
and
ichard
as
sponge
came
clanking
downstairs
with
the
in
his
hand
she
met
him
accidentally
of
course
at
the
bottom
with
the
boy
in
her
arms
and
exclaimed
sponge
here
gustavus
james
wants
to
tell
you
a
little
story
sponge
stopped
inwardly
hoping
that
it
would
not
be
a
long
one
my
darling
said
she
sticking
the
boy
up
straight
to
get
him
to
begin
then
exclaimed
crowdey
in
the
true
style
from
the
vehicle
at
the
door
in
which
he
had
composed
himself
jog
coming
replied
crowdey
with
a
frown
on
her
brow
at
the
untimely
interruption
then
appealing
again
to
the
child
who
was
nestling
in
his
mother
bosom
as
if
disinclined
to
show
off
she
said
my
darling
let
the
gentleman
hear
how
nicely
you
say
it
the
child
still
slunk
a
fine
fellow
out
with
it
said
sponge
taking
up
his
hat
to
be
off
then
exclaimed
his
host
again
replied
sponge
as
if
to
thwart
him
the
child
then
began
jogglebury
holding
up
her
forefinger
as
well
in
admiration
as
to
keep
silence
and
ichard
two
pretty
men
lay
in
bed
till
clock
struck
ten
up
starts
obin
and
looks
at
the
sky
and
then
the
brat
stopped
beautiful
exclaimed
sponge
beautiful
one
of
moore
is
it
thank
you
my
little
dear
thank
you
added
he
chucking
him
under
the
chin
and
putting
on
his
hat
to
be
off
but
stop
mr
sponge
exclaimed
jogglebury
have
heard
it
all
there
more
yet
then
turning
to
the
child
she
thus
attempted
to
give
him
the
cue
ho
bother
then
time
hup
again
shouted
jogglebury
into
the
passage
dear
jogglebury
will
you
hold
your
stoopid
tongue
exclaimed
she
adding
certainly
are
the
most
tiresome
man
under
the
sun
she
then
turned
to
the
child
with
ho
bother
ichard
again
but
the
child
was
mute
and
sponge
fearing
from
some
indistinct
growling
that
proceeded
from
the
carriage
that
a
storm
was
brewing
endeavoured
to
cut
short
the
entertainment
by
exclaiming
pity
he
not
in
the
darby
dare
say
he
tell
me
the
rest
when
i
come
back
but
this
only
added
fuel
to
the
fire
of
jogglebury
ardour
and
made
her
more
anxious
that
sponge
should
not
lose
a
word
of
it
accordingly
she
gave
the
fat
dumpling
another
jerk
up
on
her
arm
and
repeated
ho
bother
ichard
the
what
very
high
asked
jogglebury
coaxingly
very
high
replied
the
child
my
darling
exclaimed
the
delighted
mamma
jogglebury
then
proceeded
with
go
before
bottle
and
bag
i
follow
after
jack
nag
now
that
wonderful
exclaimed
sponge
hurrying
on
his
gloves
and
wishing
both
obin
and
ichard
farther
it
exclaimed
jogglebury
in
ecstasies
then
addressing
the
child
she
said
that
a
good
boy
that
a
fine
fellow
now
could
he
say
it
all
over
by
himself
does
he
think
jogglebury
looking
at
sponge
as
if
she
was
meditating
the
richest
possible
treat
for
him
replied
sponge
quite
tired
of
the
detention
tell
me
it
when
i
return
he
tell
me
it
when
i
return
at
the
same
time
giving
the
child
another
parting
chuck
under
the
chin
but
the
child
was
not
to
be
put
off
in
that
way
and
instead
of
crouching
and
nestling
and
hiding
its
face
it
looked
up
quite
boldly
and
after
a
little
hesitation
went
through
and
ichard
to
the
delight
of
jogglebury
the
mortification
of
sponge
and
the
growling
denunciations
of
old
jog
who
still
kept
his
place
in
the
vehicle
sponge
could
not
but
stay
the
poem
out
at
last
they
got
started
jog
driving
sponge
occupying
the
low
seat
flail
and
sponge
cane
stuck
in
the
straps
of
the
apron
jog
was
very
crusty
at
first
and
did
little
but
whip
and
flog
the
old
horse
and
puff
and
growl
about
being
late
keeping
people
waiting
the
horse
and
so
on
a
cigar
at
last
asked
sponge
opening
the
case
and
tendering
that
olive
branch
to
his
companion
wheeze
cigar
puff
replied
jog
eyeing
the
case
no
not
i
think
wheeze
you
never
smoke
asked
sponge
puff
wheeze
not
often
replied
jogglebury
looking
about
him
with
an
air
of
indifference
he
did
not
like
to
say
no
because
springwheat
smoked
though
springey
highly
disapproved
of
it
find
them
very
mild
observed
sponge
taking
one
out
for
himself
and
again
tendering
the
case
to
his
friend
wheeze
mild
puff
are
they
said
jog
thinking
he
would
try
one
sponge
then
struck
a
light
and
getting
his
own
cigar
well
under
way
lit
one
for
his
friend
and
presented
it
to
him
they
then
went
puffing
and
whipping
and
smoking
in
silence
jog
spoke
first
going
to
be
puff
sick
observed
he
slowly
and
solemnly
not
replied
sponge
with
a
hearty
whiff
up
into
the
air
going
to
be
puff
sick
observed
jog
after
another
pause
sick
on
your
own
side
then
replied
sponge
with
another
hearty
whiff
the
puff
powers
i
puff
sick
exclaimed
jogglebury
after
another
pause
and
throwing
away
the
cigar
dear
exclaimed
he
should
have
given
me
that
nasty
puff
thing
dear
fellow
i
did
know
it
would
make
you
sick
replied
sponge
but
puff
if
they
wheeze
other
people
sick
in
all
puff
probability
they
wheeze
me
there
exclaimed
he
pulling
up
again
the
delays
occasioned
by
these
catastrophes
together
with
the
time
lost
by
and
ichard
threw
our
sportsmen
out
considerably
when
they
reached
chalkerley
gate
it
wanted
ten
minutes
to
eleven
and
they
had
still
three
miles
to
go
shall
be
late
observed
sponge
inwardly
denouncing
and
ichard
wonder
replied
jog
adding
with
a
puff
into
his
frill
of
making
me
sick
you
see
dear
fellow
if
you
do
know
your
own
stomach
by
this
time
you
did
ought
to
do
replied
sponge
puff
flatter
myself
i
wheeze
my
own
stomach
replied
jogglebury
tartly
they
then
rumbled
on
for
some
time
in
silence
when
they
came
within
sight
of
snobston
green
the
coast
was
clear
not
a
red
coat
or
hunting
indication
of
any
sort
was
to
be
seen
told
you
so
puff
growled
jog
blowing
full
into
his
frill
and
pulling
up
short
be
gone
to
hackberry
dean
said
an
old
man
breaking
stones
by
the
roadside
dean
puff
hackberry
dean
wheeze
replied
jog
thoughtfully
we
must
puff
by
tollarton
mill
and
through
the
wheeze
village
to
stewley
drawled
the
man
jog
then
drove
on
a
few
paces
and
turned
up
a
lane
to
the
left
whose
directed
the
road
tollarton
he
seemed
less
disconcerted
than
sponge
who
kept
inwardly
anathematizing
not
only
and
ichard
but
diddle
doubt
bah
black
sheep
the
whole
tribe
of
nursery
ballads
in
short
the
fact
was
jog
wanted
to
be
into
hackberry
dean
which
was
full
of
fine
straight
hollies
fit
either
for
gibbeys
or
and
the
hounds
being
there
gave
him
the
entrée
it
was
for
helping
himself
there
without
this
excuse
that
he
had
been
and
he
did
not
care
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
the
judge
he
now
whipped
and
jagged
the
old
nag
as
if
intent
on
catching
the
hounds
sponge
liberated
his
whip
from
the
and
lent
a
hand
when
jog
began
to
flag
so
they
rattled
and
jingled
away
at
an
amended
pace
still
it
seemed
to
sponge
as
if
they
would
never
get
there
having
passed
through
tollarton
and
cleared
the
village
of
stewley
sponge
strained
his
eyes
in
every
direction
where
there
was
a
bit
of
wood
in
hopes
of
seeing
something
of
the
hounds
meanwhile
jog
was
shuffling
his
little
axe
from
below
the
cushion
of
the
into
the
pocket
of
his
all
of
a
sudden
he
pulled
up
as
they
were
passing
a
bank
of
wood
hackberry
dean
and
handing
the
reins
to
his
companion
said
lay
hold
for
a
minute
whilst
i
puff
out
happened
asked
sponge
sick
again
are
you
puff
not
exactly
wheeze
sick
but
i
want
to
be
out
all
the
puff
same
so
saying
out
he
bundled
and
crushing
through
the
woodbiney
fence
darted
into
the
wood
in
a
way
that
astonished
our
hero
presently
the
chop
chop
chop
of
the
axe
revealed
the
mystery
the
powers
the
fool
at
his
sticks
exclaimed
sponge
disgusted
at
the
contretemps
jogglebury
roared
he
jogglebury
we
shall
never
catch
up
the
hounds
at
this
rate
but
jog
was
deaf
chop

was
all
the
answer
sponge
got

me
if

he
would
drive
on
if

jogglebury

from
the
wood
replied
sponge
was
the
answer
and
the
chop
chop
chopping
was
resumed
man
mad
muttered
sponge
throwing
himself
back
in
the
seat
at
length
jog
appeared
brushing
and
tearing
his
way
out
of
the
wood
with
two
fine
hollies
under
his
arm
he
was
running
down
with
perspiration
and
looked
anxiously
up
and
down
the
road
as
he
blundered
through
the
fence
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
coming
really
think
puff
this
will
make
a
wheeze
exclaimed
he
as
he
advanced
towards
the
carriage
holding
a
holly
so
as
to
show
its
full
length
that
i
puff
wheeze
gasp
do
much
in
that
puff
wheeze
line
but
really
it
is
such
a
puff
wheeze
beauty
that
i
puff

gasp
resist
it
but
i
thought
we
were
going
to
hunt
observed
sponge
dryly
puff
so
we
are
wheeze
but
there
are
no
hounds
gasp
my
good
puff
man
continued
he
addressing
a
countryman
who
now
came
up
you

anything
of
the
wheeze

replied
the
man
be
gone
to
brookdale
plantin
we

after
them
said
jog
running
the
stick
through
the
and
bundling
into
the
phaeton
with
the
long
one
in
his
hand
away
they
rattled
and
jingled
as
before
far
is
it
asked
sponge
vexed
at
the
detention
puff
close
by
wheeze
replied
jog
by
as
most
of
our
sporting
readers
well
know
to
their
cost
is
generally
anything
but
close
by
nor
was
jog
close

on
this
occasion
said
jog
after
they
had
got
crawled
up
trampington
hill
it
puff
to
the
right
by
the
wheeze
water
there
pointing
to
a
plantation
about
a
mile
off
with
a
pond
shining
at
the
end
just
as
sponge
caught
view
of
the
water
the
twang
of
a
horn
was
heard
and
the
hounds
came
pouring
full
cry
out
of
cover
followed
by
about
twenty
variously
clad
horsemen
and
our
friend
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
run
clean
out
of
sight
over
as
fine
a
country
as
ever
was
crossed
worst
of
all
he
thought
he
saw
leather
pounding
away
on
the

hill
whose
summit
they
had
just
reached
as
the
hounds
broke
cover
commanded
an
extensive
view
over
the
adjoining
vale
and
as
sponge
sat
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
from
a
bright
wintry
sun
he
thought
he
saw
them
come
to
a
check
and
afterwards
bend
to
the
left
really
think
said
he
addressing
his
still
perspiring
companion
if
you
were
to
make
for
that
road
on
the
left
pointing
one
out
as
seen
between
the
low
in
the
distance

catch
them
up
yet
puff
left
wheeze
replied
jogglebury
crowdey
staring
about
with
anything
but
the
quickness
that
marked
his
movements
when
he
dived
into
hackberry
dean
you
see
asked
sponge
tartly
a
road
by
the
yonder
pointing
them
out
see
replied
jogglebury
blowing
freely
into
his
see
repeated
he
staring
that
way
i
think
puff
that
a
mere
wheeze
occupation
road
leading
to
gasp
nowhere
mind
let
try
exclaimed
sponge
giving
the
rein
a
jerk
to
get
the
horse
into
motion
again
adding
no
use
sitting
here
you
know
like
a
couple
of
fools
when
the
hounds
are
running
of
puff
growled
jog
not
liking
the
appellation
and
wishing
to
be
home
with
the
long
holly
do
see
anything
wheeze
foolish
in
the
puff
business
they
are
exclaimed
sponge
who
had
kept
his
eye
on
the
spot
he
last
viewed
them
and
now
saw
the
horsemen
across
a
grass
field
in
the
easy
way
that
distance
makes
very
uneasy
riding
look
along
exclaimed
he
laying
into
the
horse
with
his
the
horse
is
puff
tired
retorted
jog
angrily
holding
the
horse
instead
of
letting
him
go
to
sponge
salute
a
bit
o
exclaimed
sponge
as
paint
spring
him
a
bit
that
a
good
fellow
added
he
jog
did
fancy
being
dictated
to
in
this
way
and
just
crawled
along
at
his
own
pace
some
six
miles
an
hour
his
dull
phlegmatic
face
contrasting
with
the
eager
excitement
of
sponge
countenance
if
it
had
not
been
that
jog
wanted
to
see
that
leather
did
not
play
any
tricks
with
his
horse
he
would
not
have
gone
a
yard
to
please
sponge
jog
might
however
have
been
easy
on
that
score
for
leather
had
just
buckled
the
of
the
horse
bridle
round
a
tree
in
the
plantations
where
they
found
and
the
animal
being
used
to
this
sort
of
work
had
quite
contentedly
upon
the
grass
within
reach
bilkington
pike
now
appeared
in
view
and
jog
drew
in
as
he
spied
it
he
knew
the
damage
sixpence
for
carriages
and
he
doubted
that
sponge
would
pay
it
no
use
going
any
wheeze
farther
observed
he
drawing
up
into
a
walk
as
he
eyed
the
gable
end
of
the
and
the
formidable
white
gate
across
the
road
tom
coppers
had
heard
the
hounds
and
knowing
the
hurry
sportsmen
are
often
in
had
taken
the
precaution
to
lock
the
gate
a
farther
exclaimed
sponge
soothingly
whose
anxiety
in
looking
after
the
hounds
had
prevented
his
seeing
this
formidable
impediment
you
would
just
drive
up
to
that
farmhouse
on
the
hill
pointing
to
one
about
half
a
mile
off
think
we
should
be
able
to
decide
whether
it
worth
going
on
or
not
puff
well
wheeze
well
gasp
pondered
jogglebury
still
staring
at
the
gate
you
puff
think
it
worth
wheeze
while
going
through
the
gasp
gate
nodding
towards
it
as
he
spoke
never
mind
the
gate
replied
sponge
with
an
ostentatious
dive
into
his
breeches
pocket
as
if
he
was
going
to
pay
it
he
kept
his
hand
in
his
pocket
till
he
came
close
up
to
the
gate
when
suddenly
drawing
it
out
he
said
hang
it
i
left
my
purse
at

never
mind
drive

to
his

asked
he
seeing
the
importance
of
the
person
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
a
trustee
of
that
and
other
roads
and
one
who
always
availed
himself
of
his
privilege
of
going
to
the
meetings
replied
jog
pompously
handing
sponge
the
whip
and
reins
he
then
rose
deliberately
from
his
seat
and
slowly
unbuttoned
each
particular
button
of
the
brown
he
had
over
the
tight
black
hunting
one
he
then
unbuttoned
the
black
and
next
the
pocket
of
the
white
moleskins
in
which
he
carried
his
money
he
then
deliberately
fished
up
his
purse
a
souvenir
of

smiler
jogglebury
and
holding
it
with
both
hands
before
his
eyes
to
see
which
end
contained
the
silver
he
slowly
drew
the
slide
and
took
out
a
shilling
though
there
were
plenty
of
sixpences
in
this
gave
the
man
an
errand
into
the
to
get
one
and
by
way
of
marking
his
attention
when
he
returned
he
said
in
the

that

against

to
set
the

nothin
observed
jog
drily
drawing
the
reins
as
the
man
again
returned
to
the
a
considerable
delay
then
took
place
first
pikey
had
to
find
his
glasses
as
he
called
his
spectacles
to
look
out
a
ticket
then
he
had
to
look
out
the
tickets
when
he
found
he
had
all
sorts
except
a
one
ready
waggons
hearses
chaises
and
pair
mules
asses
every
sort
but
the
one
that
was
wanted
well
then
he
had
to
fill
one
up
and
to
do
this
he
had
first
to
find
the
and
then
a
pen
that
would
so
that
altogether
a
delay
took
place
that
would
have
been
peculiarly
edifying
to
a
kennington
common
or
lambeth
to
witness
but
it
was
not
all
over
yet
having
got
the
ticket
jog
examined
it
minutely
to
see
that
it
was
all
right
then
held
it
to
his
nose
to
smell
it
and
ultimately
drew
the
purse
slide
and
deposited
it
among
the
sovereigns
he
then
restored
that
expensive
trophy
to
his
pocket
shook
his
leg
to
send
it
down
then
buttoned
the
pocket
and
took
the
tight
black
coat
with
both
hands
and
dragged
it
across
his
chest
so
as
to
get
his
stomach
in
he
then
gasped
and
held
his
breath
making
himself
as
small
as
possible
while
he
coaxed
the
buttons
into
the
holes
and
that
difficult
process
being
at
length
accomplished
he
stood
still
awhile
to
take
breath
after
the
exertion
then
he
began
to
rebutton
the
easy
brown
going
deliberately
up
the
whole
series
from
the
small
button
below
to
keep
the
laps
together
up
to
the
one
on
the
neck
or
where
the
neck
would
have
been
if
jog
had
not
been
all
stomach
up
to
the
chin
he
then
soused
himself
into
his
seat
and
snorting
heavily
through
his
nostrils
took
the
reins
and
whip
and
long
holly
from
sponge
and
drove
leisurely
on
sponge
sat
anathematizing
his
slowness
when
they
reached
the
farmhouse
on
the
hill
the
hounds
were
fairly
in
view
the
huntsman
was
casting
them
and
the
horsemen
were
grouped
about
as
usual
while
the
laggers
were
stealing
quietly
up
the
lanes
and
thinking
nobody
would
see
them
save
the
whites
or
the
greys
our
friends
in
the
were
not
sufficiently
near
to
descry
the
colours
of
the
horses
but
sponge
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
recognized
the
outline
of
the
wicked
chestnut
the
powers
but
if
it
is
him
muttered
he
to
himself
clenching
his
fist
and
grinding
his
teeth
as
he
spoke
i
i
i
make
an
example
of
you
meaning
of
leather
sponge
could
not
exactly
say
what
he
would
do
for
it
was
by
no
means
a
settled
point
whether
leather
or
he
were
master
but
to
the
hounds
if
it
had
not
been
for
sponge
shabbiness
at
the
turnpike
gate
we
really
believe
he
might
now
have
caught
them
up
for
the
road
to
them
was
down
hill
all
the
way
and
the
impetus
of
the
vehicle
would
have
sent
the
old
screw
along
that
delay
however
was
fatal
before
they
had
gone
a
quarter
of
the
distance
the
hounds
suddenly
struck
the
scent
at
a
and
with
heads
up
and
sterns
down
went
straight
away
at
a
pace
that
annihilated
all
hope
they
were
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
it
was
clearly
a
case
of
kill
there
a
go
exclaimed
sponge
folding
his
arms
and
throwing
himself
back
in
the
phaeton
in
disgust
think
i
never
saw
such
a
mess
as
we
made
this
morning
and
he
looked
at
the
stick
in
the
apron
and
the
long
holly
between
legs
and
longed
to
lay
them
about
his
great
back
puff
i
wheeze
we
may
as
well
puff
home
now
observed
jog
looking
about
him
quite
unconcernedly
think
so
snapped
sponge
adding
done
it
for
once
at
all
events
the
observation
however
was
lost
upon
jog
whose
mind
was
occupied
with
thinking
how
to
get
the
phaeton
round
without
upsetting
the
road
was
narrow
at
best
and
the
newly
laid
had
encroached
upon
its
bounds
he
first
tried
to
back
between
two
but
only
succeeded
in
running
a
wheel
into
one
he
then
tried
the
forward
tack
with
no
better
success
till
sponge
seeing
matters
were
getting
worse
just
jumped
out
and
taking
the
old
horse
by
the
head
executed
the
manoeuvre
that
jogglebury
crowdey
first
attempted
they
then
commenced
retracing
their
steps
rather
a
long
trail
even
for
people
in
an
amiable
mood
but
a
terribly
long
one
for
disagreeing
ones
jog
to
be
sure
was
pretty
comfortable
he
had
got
all
he
wanted
all
he
went
out
for
and
as
he
hissed
and
jerked
the
old
horse
along
he
kept
casting
an
eye
at
the
contents
of
the
apron
thinking
what
crowned
or
great
man
head
the
now
rough
knobs
should
be
fashioned
to
represent
and
indulged
in
speculations
as
to
their
prospective
worth
and
possible
destination
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
a
thousand
sticks
to
each
of
his
children
would
be
as
good
as
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
sometimes
he
thought
more
but
never
less
sponge
on
the
other
hand
brooded
over
the
loss
of
the
run
indulged
in
all
sorts
of
speculations
as
to
the
splendour
of
the
affair
pictured
the
figure
he
would
have
cut
on
the
chestnut
and
the
price
he
might
have
got
for
him
in
the
field
then
he
thought
of
the
bucketing
leather
would
give
him
the
way
he
would
ram
him
at
everything
how
he
would
let
him
go
with
a
slack
rein
in
the
deep
very
likely
making
him
nay
there
was
no
saying
but
he
might
stake
him
then
he
thought
over
all
the
misfortunes
and
mishaps
of
the
day
the
unpropitious
toilet
the
aggravation
of
and
ichard
the
delay
caused
by
jog
being
sick
with
his
cigar
the
divergence
into
hackberry
dean
and
the
long
protracted
wait
at
the
reviewing
all
the
circumstances
fairly
and
dispassionately
sponge
came
to
the
determination
of
having
nothing
more
to
do
with
jogglebury
crowdey
in
the
hunting
way
these
or
similar
cogitations
and
resolutions
were
at
length
interrupted
by
their
arriving
at
home
as
denoted
by
an
outburst
of
children
rushing
from
the
lodge
to
receive
them
gustavus
james
in
his
nurse
arms
bringing
up
the

were

we
do
not

to
say
that
they
had
not
plenty
to

their

sir
harry
was
what
is
technically
called

like
our
noble
friend
lord
now
earl
of
scamperdale
he
had
worked
through
the
morning
of
life
without
knowing
what
it
was
to
be
troubled
with
money
but
unlike
his
lordship
now
that
he
had
unexpectedly
come
into
some
he
seemed
bent
upon
trying
how
fast
he
could
get
through
it
in
this
laudable
endeavour
he
was
ably
assisted
by
lady
scattercash
late

lovely
and
elegant

him

having
at
the
time
some
intention
of
trying
his
luck
on
the

but
he
always
declared
that
he
never
regretted
his
choice
on
the
contrary
he
said
if
he
had
gone
among

could
not
have

himself

lady
scattercash
could

indeed
she
used
to
do
scenes
in
the
circle

horses
and
a
flag
and
she
could
drive
and
smoke
and
sing
and
was
possessed
of
many
other
accomplishments

harry
would
sometimes
drink
straight
on

for
a

and
then
not
taste

again
for

sometimes

hunted

sometimes
they

they
were
advertized
and
sometimes
they
were

they
went
out
on
one
day
and
sometimes
on
another
sometimes
they
were
fixed
to
be
at
such
a
place
and
went
to
quite
a
different

the

were
of

of
no
particular
stamp

the
men
scamps
and
vagabonds
of
the
first

such

and
such
an
establishment
we
need
hardly
say
that
no
stranger
ever
came
into

for
the
purpose
of

sir

entirely
composed
of
his
own
choice
and
a
few
farmers

people
whom
he
could
abuse

do

he
liked

crowdey
to
be
sure
had
mentioned
sir
harry
approvingly
when
he
went
to

to
inveigle
sponge
over
to
puddingpote
bower
but
what
might
suit
jogglebury
who
went
out
to
seek
gibbey
sticks
might
not
suit
a
person
who
went
out
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
a
fox
in
order
to
show
off
and
sell
his
horses
in
fact
puddingpote
bower
was
an
exceedingly
bad
hunting
quarter
as
things
turned
out
sir
harry
scattercash
having
had
the
run
described
in
our
two
preceding
chapters
and
having
just
imported
a
few
of
the
sort
from
town
was
not
likely
to
be
going
out
again
for
a
time
while
puffington
finding
where
sponge
had
taken
refuge
determined
not
to
meet
within
reach
of
puddingpote
bower
if
he
could
possibly
help
it
and
lord
scamperdale
was
almost
always
beyond
distance
unless
horse
and
rider
lay
out
a
proceeding
always
deprecated
by
prudent
sportsmen
sponge
therefore
got
more
of
jogglebury
crowdey
company
than
he
wanted
and
crowdey
got
more
of
sponge
than
he
desired
in
vain
jog
took
him
up
into
his
attics
and
his
closets
and
his
various
holes
and
corners
and
showed
him
his
enormous
stock
of
sticks
some
tied
in
sheaves
like
corn
some
put
up
more
sparingly
and
others
again
wrapped
in
silver
paper
with
their
valuable
heads
enveloped
in
old
gloves
jog
would
untie
the
strings
of
these
and
placing
the
heads
in
the
most
favourable
position
before
our
friend
just
as
an

question
him

holding

after

replied

with
great
dignity
returning
the
head
to
the

he
showed
several
others
with
little
better
success
sponge
seeming
rather
to
take
a
pleasure
in
finding
ridiculous
likenesses
instead
of
helping
his
host
out
in
his
conceits
the
was
a
failure
as
far
as
sponge
was
concerned
neither
were
the
peregrinations
about
the
farms
or
as
jog
called
his
estate
more
successful
a
estate
like
his
children
being
seldom
of
much
interest
to
any
but
himself
jog
and
sponge
were
soon
most
heartily
sick
of

for
the
young
rogue
having
been
in

room
while
murry
ann
was
doing
it
out
had
torn
the
back
off
sponge
and
made
such
a
mess
of
his
by
cleaning
his
shoes
with
it
as
never
was
seen
sponge
soon
began
to
think
it
was
not
worth
while
staying
at
puddingpote
bower
for
the
mere
sake
of
his
keep
seeing
there
was
no
hunting
to
be
had
from
it
and
it
did
not
do
to
keep
hack
hunters
idle
especially
in
open
weather
leather
and
he
for
once
were
of
the
same
opinion
and
that
worthy
shook
his
head
and
said
crowdey
was
mean
at
the
same
time
pulling
out
a
sample
of
bad
ship
oats
that
he
had
got
from
a
neighbouring
ostler
to
show
the
their
were
a
eatin
of
the
fact
was
jog
beer
was
nothing
like
so
strong
as
puffington
added
to
which
crowdey
carried
the
principles
of
the
union
into
his
own
establishment
and
dieted
his
servants
upon
certain
rules
sunday
roast
beef
potatoes
and
pudding
under
the
meat
monday
fried
beef
and
as
they
profanely
called
a
certain
pudding
wednesday
leg
of
mutton
and
so
on
the
allowance
of
beer
was
a
pint
and
a
half
per
diem
to
bartholomew
and
a
pint
to
each
woman
and
crowdey
used
to
observe
from
the
head
of
the
servants
on
the
arrival
of
each
cargo
this
puff
beer
is
to
wheeze
a
month
and
if
you
choose
to
drink
it
in
a
gasp
day
you
go
without
any
for
the
rest
of
the
wheeze
time
an
intimation
that
had
a
very
favourable
effect
upon
the
tap
leather
however
did
not
like
it
servants
he
said
beer
whenever
they
chose
and
he
thought
it
mean
restricting
the
quantity
mr
jog
however
was
not
to
be
moved
thus
time
crawled
heavily
on
and
mrs
jog
had
a
long
confab
one
night
on
the
expediency
of
getting
rid
of
sponge
mrs
jog
wanted
to
keep
him
on
till
after
the
christening
while
jog
combated
her
reasons
by
representing
the
improbability
of
its
doing
gustavus
james
any
good
having
him
for
a
godpapa
seeing
sponge
age
and
the
probability
of
his
marrying
himself
mrs
jog
however
was
very
determined
rather
too
much
so
indeed
for
she
awakened
jog
jealousy
who
lay
tossing
and
tumbling
about
all
through
the
night
he
was
up
very
early
and
as
mrs
jog
was
falling
into
a
comfortable
nap
she
was
aroused
by
his
voice
hallooing
as
loud
as
he
could
in
the
middle
of
the
the
last
syllable
being
pronounced
or
prolonged
like
a
mew
of
a
cat
repeated
he
not
getting
an
answer
to
the
first
shout
ann
shouted
he
after
another
pause
ann
exclaimed
he
still
louder
just
then
the
iron
latch
of
a
door
at
the
top
of
the
house
opened
and
a
female
voice
exclaimed
hurriedly
over
the
banisters

replied
mary

all
this
was
said
in
such
a
tone
as
could
not
fail
to
be
heard
all
over
the
house
certainly
into

room

was
midway

speakers

the
reason
sponge
did
not
take
his
departure
after
the
pretty
intelligible
hint
given
by
his
host
was
that
as
he
was
passing
his
shilling
army

over

soapy
chin

saw
a
stockingless
lad
in
a
purply

burn
which
being
communicated
to
our
friends
about
midnight
in
the
at
nonsuch
house
it
was
resolved
to
hunt
him
forthwith
especially
as
one
of
the
guests
orlando
bugles
of
the
surrey
theatre
was
obliged
to
return
to
town
immediately
and
as
he
sometimes
enacted
the
part
of
squire
tallyho
it
was
thought
a
little
of
the
reality
might
correct
the
tom
and
jerry
style
in
which
he
did
it
accordingly
orders
were
issued
for
a
hunt
notwithstanding
the
hounds
were
fed
and
the
horses
watered
sir
harry
did
a
rap
let
them
go
as
fast
as
they
could
all
these
circumstances
conspired
to
make
them
late
added
to
which
when
watchorn
the
huntsman
cast
up
which
he
did
on
a
higgler
horse
he
found
the
only
sound
one
in
his
stud
had
gone
to
the
neighbouring
town
to
get
some
fiddlers
her
ladyship
having
determined
to
compliment
visit
by
a
quadrille
party
bugles
and
she
were
old
friends
when
sponge
cast
up
at
eleven
things
were
still
sir
harry
and
party
had
had
a
wet
night
of
it
and
were
all
more
or
less
drunk
they
had
kept
up
the
excitement
with
a
champagne
breakfast
and
various
liqueurs
to
say
nothing
of
cigars
they
were
a
sad
set
some
of
them
scarcely
out
of
their
teens
with
pallid
cheeks
trembling
hands
sunken
eyes
and
all
the
symptoms
of
premature
decay
others
the
ones
were
a
wigged
and
padded
set
bugles
was
resplendent
he
had
on
a
dress
scarlet
coat
lined
and
faced
with
yellow
satin
one
of
the
properties
we
believe
of
the
victoria
a
beautifully
worked
pink
a
coloured
waistcoat
white
ducks
and
with
brass
heel
spurs
he
carried
his
whip
in
the
of
a
circus
master
following
a
horse
some
dozen
of
these
curiosities
were
staggering
and
swaggering
and
smoking
in
front
of
nonsuch
house
to
the
edification
of
a
lot
of
gaping
grooms
and
chawbacons
when
sponge
cantered
becomingly
up
on
the
piebald
lady
scattercash
with
several
elegantly
dressed
females
all
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
were
conversing
with
them
from
the
open
windows
above
while
sundry
damsels
ogled
them
from
the
attics
above
such
was
the
tableau
that
presented
itself
to
sponge
as
he
cantered
round
the
turn
that
brought
him
in
front
of
the
elizabethan
mansion
of
nonsuch
house
sir
harry
who
was
still
rather
drunk
thinking
that
every
person
there
must
be
either
one
of
his
party
or
a
friend
of
one
of
his
party
or
a
neighbour
or
some
one
that
he
had
seen
before
reeled
up
to
our
friend
as
he
stopped
and
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand
asked
him
to
come
in
and
have
something
to
eat
this
was
a
godsend
to
sponge
who
accepted
the
proffered
hand
most
readily
shaking
it
in
a
way
that
quite
satisfied
sir
harry
he
was
right
in
some
one
or
other
of
his
conjectures
bugles
and
all
the
reeling
swaggering
bucks
looked
respectfully
at
the
man
and
bugles
determined
to
have
a
pair
of
tops
as
soon
as
ever
he
got
back
to
town
sir
harry
was
a
tall
wan
pale
young
man
with
a
strong
tendency
to
delirium
tremens
that
and
consumption
appeared
to
be
running
a
match
for
his
person
he
was
a
fellow
all
strings
and
tapes
and
ends
and
flue
he
looked
as
if
he
slept
in
his
clothes
his
hat
was
fastened
on
with
a
ribbon
or
rather
a
ribbon
passed
round
near
the
band
in
order
to
fasten
it
on
for
it
was
seldom
or
ever
applied
to
the
purpose
and
the
ends
generally
went
flying
out
behind
like
a
chinaman
tail
then
his
flashy
cravats
stared
and
straggled
in
all
directions
while
his
untied
protruded
between
the
laps
of
his
old
scarlet
mixing
in
glorious
confusion
with
those
of
his
breeches
behind
the
were
generally
also
loose
the
web
straps
of
his
boots
were
seldom
in
and
what
with
one
set
of
strings
and
another
he
had
acquired
the
name
of
jack
sponge
having
dismounted
and
given
his
hack
to
the
now
leather
followed
sir
harry
through
a
foil
and
hall
to
the
deserted
where
chairs
stood
in
all
directions
and
crumpled
napkins
strewed
the
floor
the
litter
of
eggs
and
remnants
of
muffins
and
diminished
piles
of
toast
and
broken
bread
and
empty
toast
racks
and
cups
and
saucers
and
glasses
and
wholly
emptied
champagne
bottles
were
scattered
up
and
down
a
disorderly
table
further
littered
with
newspapers
letter
backs
county
court
summonses
mustard
pots
anchovies
pickles
all
the
odds
and
ends
of
a
most
miscellaneous
meal
the
exhibited
cold
joints
game
poultry
lukewarm
hashed
venison
and
sundry
dishes
of
savoury
grills
you
are
exclaimed
sir
harry
taking
his
and
sweeping
the
contents
of
one
end
of
the
table
on
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
that
brought
in
the
butler
and
some
servants
those
filthy
things
away
hiccup
exclaimed
sir
harry
crushing
the
broken
china
smaller
under
his
heels
hiccup
bring
some
and
what
the
deuce
does
the
hiccup
cook
mean
by
not
hiccuping
things
as
he
ought
now
said
he
addressing
sponge
and
raking
the
plates
and
dishes
up
to
him
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
just
as
a
keeper
rakes
up
the
stakes
said
he
your
hiccup
game
there
be
some
hot
hiccup
in
directly
he
meant
to
say
but
the
word
failed
him
sponge
fell
to
with
avidity
he
was
always
ready
to
eat
and
attacked
first
one
thing
and
then
another
as
though
he
had
not
had
any
breakfast
at
puddingpote
bower
sir
harry
remained
mute
for
some
minutes
sitting
and
backwards
in
his
chair
with
his
throbbing
temples
resting
upon
the
back
wondering
where
it
was
that
he
had
met
sponge
he
looked
different
without
his
hat
and
though
he
saw
it
was
no
one
he
knew
particularly
he
could
not
help
thinking
he
had
seen
him
before
indeed
he
thought
it
was
clear
from
sponge
manner
that
they
had
met
and
he
was
just
going
to
ask
him
whether
it
was
at
offley
or
the
coal
hole
when
a
sudden
move
outside
attracted
his
attention
it
was
the
hounds
the
huntsman
horse
having
at
length
returned
from
the
fiddler
hunt
and
being
whisped
over
and
made
tolerably
decent
watchorn
having
exchanged
the
postilion
saddle
in
which
it
had
been
ridden
for
a
hunting
one
had
mounted
and
opening
the
had
liberated
the
pack
who
came
tearing
out
full
cry
and
spread
themselves
over
the
country
regardless
alike
of
the
twang
twang
twang
of
the
horn
and
the
furious
onslaught
of
a
couple
of
stable
lads
in
scarlet
and
caps
who
true
to
the
title
of
let
drive
at
all
they
could
get
within
reach
of
the
hounds
had
not
been
out
even
to
exercise
since
the
day
and
were
as
wild
as
hawks
they
were
ready
to
run
anything
furious
and
furrier
tackled
with
a
cow
bountiful
ran
a
black
and
made
him

while
old
thunderer
and
supposed
to
be

scamperdale
joined
in
pursuit
of
a
cur
watchorn
however
did
not
care
for
these
little
ebullitions
of
spirit
and
never
having
been
accustomed
to
exercise
the
camberwell
and
balham
hill
union
harriers
he
did
not
see
any
occasion
for
troubling
the
would
soon
settle
he
said
they
got
a
scent
it
was
this
riotous
start
that
diverted
jack
attention
from
our
friend
and
looking
out
of
the
window
sponge
saw
all
the
company
preparing
to
be
off
there
was
the
elegant
bugles
mounting
her
ladyship
white
arab
the
brothers
spangles
climbing
on
to
their
mr
this
getting
on
to
the
postman
pony
and
that
on
to
the
gamekeeper
sponge
hurried
out
to
get
to
the
brown
ere
his
anger
arose
at
being
left
behind
and
provoked
a
scene
he
only
just
arrived
in
time
for
the
twang
of
the
horn
the
cracks
of
the
whips
the
clamorous
rates
of
the
servants
the
yelping
of
the
hounds
and
the
general
commotion
had
got
up
his
courage
and
he
launched
out
in
such
a
way
when
sponge
mounted
as
would
have
shot
a
loose
rider
into
the
air
as
it
was
sponge
grappled
manfully
with
him
and
letting
the
latchfords
into
his
sides
shoved
him
in
front
of
the
throng
as
if
nothing
had
happened
leather
then
slunk
back
to
the
stables
to
get
out
the
hack
to
have
a
hunt
in
the
distance
the
hounds
as
we
said
before
were
desperately
wild
but
at
length
by
dint
of
coaxing
and
cracking
and
whooping
and
hallooing
they
got
some
ten
couples
out
of
the
gathered
together
and
watchorn
putting
himself
at
their
head
trotted
briskly
on
blowing
most
lustily
in
the
hopes
that
the
rest
would
follow
so
he
clattered
along
the
avenue
formed
between
rows
of
firs
and
sweeping
spruce
out
of
which
whirred
clouds
of
pheasants
and
scuttling
rabbits
and
stupid
hares
kept
crossing
and
recrossing
to
the
derangement
of
watchorn
temper
and
the
detriment
of
the
unsteady
pack
squeak
squeak
squeal
sounded
right
and
left
followed
sometimes
by
the
heavy
retributive
hand
of
justice
on
the
offenders
hides
and
sometimes
by
the
snarl
snap
and
worry
of
a
couple
of
hounds
contending
for
the
prey
twang
twang
twang
still
went
the
horn
and
when
the
huntsman
reached
the
gates
between
looking
lodges
he
found
himself
in
possession
of
a
clear
majority
of
his
unsizable
pack
some
were
rather
bloody
to
be
sure
and
a
few
carried
scraps
of
game
which
fastidious
masters
would
as
soon
have
seen
them
without
but
neither
sir
harry
nor
his
huntsman
cared
about
appearances
on
clearing
the
lodges
and
passing
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
the
hardington
road
ceased
and
they
came
upon
farleyfair
downs
across
which
watchorn
now
struck
making
for
a
square
plantation
near
the
first
where
it
had
been
arranged
the
should
be
shook
it
was
a
fine
day
rather
brighter
perhaps
than
sportsmen
like
and
there
was
a
crispness
in
the
air
indicative
of
frost
but
then
there
is
generally
a
burning
scent
just
before
one
so
thought
watchorn
as
he
turned
his
feverish
face
up
to
the
bright
blue
sky
imbibing
the
fine
fresh
air
of
the
downs
instead
of
the
stale
tobacco
smoke
of
the
fetid
as
he
trotted
over
the
springy
sward
up
the
gently
rising
ground
he
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
laying
hold
of
his
horse
mane
turned
to
survey
the
lagging
field
behind
have
to
look
sharp
my
hearties
said
he
to
himself
as
he
ran
them
over
in
his
eye
and
thought
there
might
be
twenty
or
horsemen
have
to
look
sharp
my
hearties
said
he
you
mean
to
get
away
for
wily
tom
has
his
hat
on
the
ground
which
shows
he
has
put
him
down
and
if
he
the
sort
of
i
expect
he
not
be
long
in
cover
so
saying
he
resumed
his
seat
in
the
saddle
and
easing
his
horse
endeavoured
by
sundry
dog
noises
such
as
doit
ravager
paragon
again
mercury
to
restrain
the
ardour
of
the
leading
hounds
so
as
to
let
the
rebellious
tail
ones
up
and
go
into
cover
with
something
like
a
body
this
was
rather
a
difficult
task
to
accomplish
for
those
with
him
being
light
and
consequently
anxious
to
be
doing
and
ready
for
riot
were
difficult
to
restrain
from
dashing
forward
while
those
that
had
taken
their
diversion
and
refreshment
among
the
game
were
easy
whether
they
did
anything
more
or
not
while
watchorn
was
thus
manoeuvring
his
forces
wily
tom
beckoned
him
on
and
old
cruiser
and
marmion
who
had
often
been
at
the
game
before
and
knew
what
wily
tom
hat
on
the
ground
meant
flew
to
him
full
cry
drawing
all
their
companions
after
them
think
he
away
to
the
west
said
tom
in
an
undertone
resting
his
hand
on
watchorn
horse
shoulder
home
added
he
jerking
his
head
with
a
knowing
leer
of
his
roguish
eye
on
him
exclaimed
he
after
a
pause
as
the
outburst
of
melody
proclaimed
that
the
hounds
had
crossed
his
line
then
there
was
such
racing
and
striving
among
the
field
to
get
up
and
such
squeezing
and
crowding
and
my
horse
kicks
at
the
little
white
hunting
wicket
leading
into
cover
down
the
wall
exclaimed
one
out
of
the
way

it
roared
another

here
all

vociferated
a
third
a

cried
another
as
a
clatter
of
stones
was
followed
by
a
pair
of
white
breeches
summerseting
in
the
air
with
a
horse
underneath

the
doctor
exclaimed
one
he

himself

but

shrieked
another
a
bit
of
it
added
a
third
as
the
dead
man
rose
and
ran
after
his
horse
bugles
through
cried
sir
harry
seeing
his
friend
or
rather
his
wife
friend
was
fretting
the
arab
meanwhile
the
melody
of
hounds
increased
and
each
man
as
he
got
through
the
little
gate
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
hustled
his
horse
along
the
green
ride
to
catch
up
those
on
before
the
plantation
was
about
twenty
acres
rather
thick
and
briary
at
the
bottom
and
master
reynard
finding
it
was
pretty
safe
and
moreover
having
attempted
to
break
just
by
where
some
chawbacons
were
ploughing
had
headed
short
back
so
that
when
the
excited
field
rushed
through
the
parallel
gate
on
the
far
side
of
the
plantation
expecting
to
see
the
pack
streaming
away
over
the
downs
they
found
most
of
the
hounds
with
their
heads
in
the
air
some
looking
for
halloos
others
watching
their
companions
trying
to
carry
the
scent
over
the
fallow
watchorn
galloped
up
in
the
frantic
state
huntsmen
generally
are
and
one
of
the
impromptu
whips
being
in
attendance
got
quickly
round
the
hounds
and
commenced
a
series
of
assaults
upon
them
that
very
soon
sent
them
scuttling
to
watchorn
for
safety
if
they
had
been
at
the
hares
again
or
even
worrying
sheep
he
could
not
have
rated
or
flogged
more
severely
marksman
ye
old
divil
get
to
him
roared
the
whip
aiming
a
stinging
cut
with
his
heavy
whip
at
a
venerable
sage
who
still
snuffed
down
a
furrow
to
satisfy
himself
the
fox
was
not
on
before
he
returned
to
cover
an
exertion
that
overbalanced
the
whip
and
would
have
landed
him
on
the
ground
had
not
he
caught
by
the
spur
in
the
old
mare
flank
then
he
went
on
scrambling
and
rating
after
marksman
the
field

as

bugles
through
at
last
he
got
shuffled
back
into
the
saddle
and
the
cry
of
hounds
in
cover
attracting
the
outsiders
back
the
scene
quickly
changed
and
the
horsemen
were
again
overhead
in
wood
they
now
swept
up
the
grass
ride
to
the
exposed
part
of
the
higher
ground
the
trees
gradually
diminishing
in
size
till
on
reaching
the
top
they
did
not
come
much
above
a
shoulder
this
point
commanded
a
fine
view
over
the
adjacent
country
behind
was
the
rich
vale
of
dairylow
with
its
villages
and
spires
and
trees
and
enclosures
while
in
front
was
nothing
but
the
undulating
downs
reaching
to
the
soft
grey
hills
in
the
distance
there
was
not
however
much
time
for
contemplating
scenery
for
wily
tom
who
had
stolen
to
this
point
immediately
the
hounds
took
up
the
scent
now
viewed
the
fox
stealing
over
a
gap
in
the
wall
and
the
field
catching
sight
there
was
such
a
hullabaloo
as
would
have
made
a
more
composed
and
orderly
minded
fox
think
it
better
to
break
instead
of
running
the
outside
of
the
wall
as
this
one
intended
to
do
what
wind
there
was
swept
over
the
downs
and
putting
himself
straight
to
catch
it
he
went
away
whisking
his
brush
in
the
air
as
if
he
was
fresh
out
of
his
kennel
instead
of
a
sack
then
what
a
commotion
there
was
such
jumpings
off
to
lead
down
such
huggings
and
holdings
and
of
those
that
sat
on
such
slidings
and
scramblings
and
loosenings
and
rollings
of
stones
then
the
frantic
horses
began
to
bound
and
the
frightened
riders
to
exclaim
get
out
of
my
way
sir
sir
i
of
you
him
his
head
and
let
him
go
exclaimed
the
still
drunken
brother
bob
spangles
sliding
his
horse
down
with
a
slack
rein
your
sort
roared
sir
harry
and
just
as
he
said
it
his
horse
dropped
on
his
like
a
rabbit
landing
sir
harry
comfortably
on
his
feet
amid
the
roars
of
the
and
the
mirth
of
such
of
the
horsemen
as
were
not
too
frightened
to
laugh

preparing
for

where
he
was
hunting
said
he
getting
off
the
fidgety
arab
dangerous
the
parties
who
accomplished
the
descent
had
now
some
fine
plain
sailing
for
their
trouble
the
line
lay
across
the
open
downs
composed
of
sound
springy
turf
extremely
well
adapted
for
trying
the
pace
either
of
horses
or
hounds
and
very
soon
it
did
try
the
pace
of
them
for
they
had
not
gone
above
a
mile
before
there
was
very
considerable
tailing
with
both
to
be
sure
they
had
never
been
very
well
together
but
still
the
line
lengthened
instead
of
contracting
horses
that
could
hardly
be
held
downhill
and
that
applied
themselves
to
the
turf
on
landing
as
if
they
could
never
have
enough
of
it
now
began
to
bear
upon
the
rein
and
hang
back
to
those
behind
while
the
hounds
came
straggling
along
like
a
flock
of
wild
geese
with
full
half
a
mile
between
the
leader
and
the
last
however
they
all
threw
their
tongues
and
each
man
flattered
himself
that
the
hound
he
was
with
was
the
first
in
vain
the
galloping
watchorn
looked
back
and
tootled
his
horn
in
vain
he
worked
with
his
cap
in
vain
the
whips
rode
at
the
tail
hounds
cursing
and
swearing
and
vowing
they
would
cut
them
in
two
there
was
no
getting
them
together
every
now
and
then
the
fox
might
be
seen
looking
about
the
size
of
a
marble
as
he
rounded
some
distant
hill
each
succeeding
view
making
him
less
till
at
last
he
seemed
no
bigger
than
a
pea
minutes
best
pace
over
downs
is
calculated
to
try
the
mettle
of
anything
and
long
before
the
leading

reached

the

was
choked
by
the

been

in

watchorn

alone
in

rather

was
in

exclaimed

as
he
heard
by
the

and
pincering
of

it
was
all

with
him
the
horse
stopped
as
if

and
getting
the

sponge
went
on
the
brown
laying
himself
out
as
if
still
full
of
running
cockthropple
dean
was
now
close
at
hand
and
in
all
probability
the
fox
would
not
leave
it
so
thought

as
he
dived
into
it
astonished
at
the
chorus

of

a

on

point
he
made
for
it
at
a

in

to
blow
as
soon
as
he
got
there
away
cried
the
man
as
soon
as
our
friend
appeared
tornops
added
he
pointing
with
his
hoe
sponge
then
put
his
horse
head
that
way
and
blew
a
long
shrill
reverberating
blast
as
he
paused
to
take
breath
and
listen
he
heard
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
presently
a
stentorian
voice
half
frantic
with
rage
exclaimed
from
behind
the
dickens
are
you
the
dickens
are

retorted
sponge
without
looking
round
commonly
call

the

roared
the
same
sweet
voice
those
are
my

not

snapped
sponge
now
looking
round
on
his

who
was
closely
followed
by
his

throwing

roared
jack
now
rising
in
his

and
brandishing
his

his

and
thereupon
jack
wiped
the
foam
from
his

on
his

exclaimed
sponge
again
putting
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
blowing
another
shrill
blast
harry
screeched
his
lordship
in
disgust
for
he
hated
the
very
sound
of

harry
oh
you

tell

that
to

repeated
jack
again

and
jack
sinking
exhausted
on

again
wiped
the
foam
from

then
went
at
sponge
again
you

you

use

that

said
he
brandishing
his
brother
to
whip
you
sir
i
fight
you
sir
any

you
like

just
then
the
clatter
and
blowing
of
horses
was
heard
and
frostyface
emerged
from
the
wood
followed
by
the
hounds
who
swinging
themselves
over
the
turnips
hit
off
the
scent
and
went
away
full
cry
followed
by
his
lordship
and
jack
leaving
sponge
transfixed
with
astonishment
foxes
at
length
said
sponge
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
just
then
the
cry
of
hounds
on
the
opposite
bank
confirmed
his
conjecture
and
he
got
to
sir
harry
in
time
to
take
up
his
lordship
fox
his
lordship
hounds
ran
into
sir
harry
fox
about
two
miles
farther
on
but
the
hounds
would
not
break
him
up
and
on
examining
him
he
was
found
to
have
been
aniseeded
and
worst
of
all
by
the
mark
on
his
ear
to
be
one
that
they
had
turned
down
themselves
the
season
before
being
one
of
a
litter
that
sly
had
stolen

to

that
they
never
think
there
is
any
difficulty
in
getting
them
there
and
it
is
only
a
combat
with
the

that
shows
them
that
the

does
not
bring
the

up
in

mouth
like

on

memory
as
gordon
cumming
would
derive
from
his
first
interview
with
a
lion
our
friend
sponge
was
now
engaged
with
a
game
of
devil
pull
baker
with
the
hounds
for
the
fox
the
difficulty
of
his
situation
being
heightened
by
having
to
contend
with
the
impetuous
temper
of
a
dangerous
horse
to
be
sure
the
gallant
hercules
was
a
good
deal
subdued
by
the
distance
and
severity
of
the
pace
but
there
are
few
horses
that
get
to
the
end
of
a
run
that
have
not
sufficient
kick
left
in
them
to
do
mischief
to
hounds
especially
when
raised
or
frightened
by
the
smell
of
blood
nevertheless
there
was
no
help
for
it
sponge
knew
that
unless
he
carried
off
some
trophy
it
would
never
be
believed
he
had
killed
the
fox
considering
all
this
and
also
that
there
was
no
one
to
tell
what
damage
he
did
he
just
rode
slap
into
the
middle
of
the
pack
as
marksman

bountiful
were
in
the

of

repeated
he
throwing
himself
off
his
horse
by
the
fox
and
clearing
a
circle
with
his
whip
aided
by
the
hoofs
of
the
animal
there
lay
the
fox
before
him
killed
but
as
yet
little
broken
by
the
pack
he
was
a
noble
fellow
bright
and
brown
in
the
full
vigour
of
life
and
condition
with
a
gameness
even
in
death
that
no

animal
shows
sponge
put
his
foot
on
the
body
and
quickly
whipped
off
his
brush
before
he
had
time
to
pocket
it
the
repulsed
pack
broke
in
upon
him
and
carried
off
the
carcass

ye
you
may
have
said
he
cutting
at
them
with
his
whip
as
they
clustered
upon
it
like
a
swarm
of
bees
they
had
not
had
a
wild
fox
for
five
weeks
cried
sponge
in
the
hopes
of
attracting
some
of
the
field
repeated
he
as
loud
as
he
could
halloo
can
they
all
be
i
wonder
said
he
looking
around
and
echo
answered
where
the
hounds
had
now
crunched
their
fox
or
as
much
of
him
as
they
wanted
old
marksman
ran
about
with
his
head
and
warrior
with
a
haunch
it
you
old
beggar
cried
sponge
cutting
at
marksman
with
his
whip
and
sponge
being
too
near
to
make
a
trial
of
speed
prudent
the
old
dog
did
as
he
was
bid
and
slunk
away
our
friend
then
appended
this
proud
trophy
to
his
by
a
piece
of
whipcord
and
mounting
the
now
tractable
hercules
began
to
cast
about
in
search
of
a
landmark
like
most
down
countries
this
one
was
somewhat
deceptive
there
were
plenty
of
landmarks
but
they
were
all
the
same
sort
clumps
of
trees
on
and
plantations
on
but
nothing
of
a
distinguishing
character
nothing
that
a
stranger
could
say
remember
seeing
that
as
i
came
or
remember
passing
that
in
the
run
the
landscape
seemed
all
alike
north
south
east
and
west
equally
indifferent
the
thing
said
sponge
adjusting
himself
in
his
saddle
and
looking
about
have
the
idea
where
i
am
i
blow
the
horn
and
see
if
that
will
bring
any
one
so
saying
he
applied
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
keen
shrill
blast
that
spread
over
the
surrounding
country
and
was
echoed
back
by
the
distant
hills
a
few
lost
hounds
cast
up
from
various
quarters
in
the
unexpected
way
that
hounds
do
come
to
a
horn
among
them
were
a
few
branded
with
s
who
did
not
at
all
set
off
the
beauty
of
the
rest
rot
you
you
belong
to
that
old
ruffian
do
you
said
sponge
riding
and
cutting
at
one
with
his
whip
exclaiming
away
to
him
ye
beggar
or
i
tuck
you
up
short
he
now
for
the
first
time
saw
them
together
in
anything
like
numbers
and
was
struck
with
the
queerness
and
inequality
of
the
whole
they
were
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
from
the
solemn
towering
down
to
the
little
wriggling
harrier
they
seemed
too
to
be
troubled
with
various
complaints
and
infirmities
some
had
the
mange
some
had
blear
eyes
some
had
but
one
many
were
out
at
the
elbows
and
not
a
few
down
at
the
toes
however
they
had
killed
a
fox
and
is
that
handsome
does
said
sponge
as
with
his
horse
surrounded
by
them
he
moved
on
in
quest
of
his
way
home
at
first
he
thought
to
retrace
his
steps
by
the
marks
of
his
hoofs
and
succeeded
in
getting
back
to
the
dean
where
sir
harry
hounds
changed
foxes
with
lord
scamperdale
but
he
got
confused
with
the
imprints
of
the
other
horses
and
very
soon
had
to
trust
entirely
to
chance
chance
we
are
sorry
to
say
did
not
befriend
him
for
after
wandering
over
the
downs
he
came
upon
the
little
hamlet
of
tinkler
hatch
and
was
informed
that
he
had
been
riding
in
a
semicircle
he
there
got
some
gruel
for
his
horse
and
with
day
closing
in
now
set
off
as
directed
on
the
ribchester
road
with
the
assurance
that
he
miss
his
way
some
of
the
hounds
here
declined
following
him
any
farther
and
slunk
into
cottages
and
outhouses
as
they
passed
along
sponge
however
did
not
care
for
their
company
having
travelled
musingly
along
two
or
three
miles
of
road
now
thinking
over
the
glorious
run
now
of
the
gallant
way
in
which
hercules
had
carried
him
now
of
the
pity
it
was
that
there
was
nobody
there
to
see
now
of
the
encounter
with
lord
scamperdale
just
as
he
passed
a
stackyard
that
had
shut
out
the
view
of
a
flaming
red
brick
house
with
a
door
and
windows
an
outburst
of
followed
by
one
cheer
more
made
the
remaining
wild
hounds
prick
up
their
ears
and
our
friend
rein
in
his
horse
to
hear
what
was
a
bright
fire
in
a
room
on
the
right
of
the
door
overpowered
the
clouds
of
with
which
the
room
was
enveloped
and
revealed
sundry
scarlet
coats
in
the
full
glow
of
joyous
hilarity
it
was
sir
harry
and
friends
recruiting
at
fanner
peastraw
after
their
exertions
for
though
they
could
not
make
much
of
hunting
they
were
always
ready
to
drink
they
were
having
a
rare
rashers
of
bacon
wedges
of
cheese
with
oceans
of
it
was
the
appearance
of
a
magnificent
cold
round
of
beef
red
with
saltpetre
and
flaky
with
white
fat
borne
on
high
by
their
host
that
elicited
the
applause
and
the
one
cheer
more
that
broke
on
sponge
ear
as
he
was
passing
applause
that
was
renewed
as
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
red
coat
not
on
account
of
his
safety
or
that
of
the
hounds
but
simply
because
being
in
the
cheering
mood
they
were
ready
to
cheer
anything
there
mr
exclaimed
brother
bob
spangles
as
he
caught
view
of
sponge
and
the
hounds
passing
the
window

three
more

the

throwing
up
the
window

refreshment
there
asked

reining
in
the
brown
we

holding
up
a
tumbler
of
hot
all
here
sir
harry
and
all
added
he
what
shall

do

asked
sponge
looking
down
upon
the
confused
pack
now
crowding
about
his
horse
head
let

the
i
meant
to
say
the

exclaimed
sponge
looking
back
on
the
deserted
road
of
them
here
hiccuped
sir
harry
who
had
now
got
reeled
to
the
window
of
them
here
repeated
he
staring
vacantly
at
the
uneven
pack

want
to

up
to

still
sat
on

in
mute
astonishment
at

tarnished
green
purse
and
exhibiting

at
the
other
i
dare
say

a
good
feller

one
of
the

he
grasping
the
latter
by
the
arm
all
these
gentlemen
severally
bobbed
their
heads
as
sir
harry
called
them
over
and
then
resumed
their
respective
occupations
eating
drinking
and
smoking
these
were
some
of
the
debauched
gentlemen
sponge
had
seen
before
nonsuch
house
in
the
morning
they
were
all
captains
or
captains
by
courtesy
ladofwax
had
been
a
painter
and
glazier
in
the
borough
where
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
captain
quod
while
that
gentleman
was
an
inmate
of
captain
hudson
strong
house
captain
bouncey
was
the
too
keeper
and
seedeybuck
was
such
a
constant
customer
of
commissioner
fonblanque
court
that
that
worthy
legal
luminary
on
discharging
him
for
the
fifth
time
said
to
him
with
a
very
significant
shake
of
the
head
better
not
come
here
again
sir
seedeybuck
being
of
the
same
opinion
had
since
fastened
himself
on
to
sir
harry
scattercash
who
found
him
in
meat
drink
washing
and
lodging
they
were
all
attired
in
red
coats
of
one
sort
or
another
though
some
of
which
were
of
a
very
antediluvian
and
others
of
a
very
cut
had
a
hare
on
the
button
and
seedeybuck
coat
sat
on
him
like
a
sack
still
a
scarlet
coat
is
a
scarlet
coat
in
the
eyes
of
some
and
the
coats
were
not
a
bit
more
unsportsmanlike
than
the
men
to
astonishment
instead
of
breaking
out
in
inquiries
as
to
where
they
had
run
to
the
time
the
distance
who
was
up
who
was
down
and
so
on
they
began
recommending
the
victuals
and
drink
and
this
notwithstanding
sponge
kept
flourishing
the
brush
had
a
rare
run
said

addressing
himself

frothing
himself
a
tumblerful
out
of
the
tall
brown
jug

this
rejoined
captain
quod
pouring
himself
out

mistake
well
but
there
somebody
on

sir
harry
staring
wildly
round
old

him
so
that
he
went
home
crying
replied
bob
spangles
he
did
lose
him
asked
sir
harry
no
replied
bob
gave
a
lad
a
shilling
to
lead
him
and
they
trudged
away
very
quietly
together
old
hiccup
exclaimed
sir
harry
told
me
he
was
a
member
of
the
surrey
something
sorry
union
replied
captain
quod
out
with
them
once
and
fell
off
on
his
head
and
knocked
his
out
but
i
was
telling
you
about
the
run
interposed
sponge
again
endeavouring
to
enlist
an
audience
was
telling
you
about
the
run
repeated
he
trouble
yourself
my
dear
sir
interrupted
captain
bouncey
know
all
about
it
found
checked
killed
killed
found
checked
know
all
about
it
snapped
sponge
there
was
a
soul
there
but
myself
much
to
my
horror
for
i
had
a
row
with
old
scamperdale
and
never
a
soul
to
back
me
you
fell
in
with
that
gentleman
who
ca
hiccup
swear
because
he
a
hiccup
lord
did
you
asked
sir
harry
his
attention
being
now
drawn
to
our
friend
replied
sponge
a
pretty
passage
of
politeness
we
had
of
it
hiccup
exclaimed
sir
harry
us
hiccup
all
about
it
said
sponge
laying
the
brush
lengthways
before
him
on
the
table
as
if
he
was
going
to
demonstrate
upon
it
you
see
we
had
a
devil
of
a
run
i
do
know
how
many
miles
as
hard
as
ever
we
could
lay
legs
to
the
ground
one
by
one
the
field
all
dropped
astern
except
the
huntsman
and
myself
at
last
he
gave
in
or
rather
his
horse
did
and
i
was
left
alone
in
my
glory
well
we
went
over
the
downs
at
a
pace
that
nothing
but
blood
could
live
with
and
though
my
horse
has
never
been
beat
and
is
as
as
eclipse
a
horse
that
i
have
refused
three
hundred
guineas
for
over
and
over
again
i
really
did
begin
to
think
i
might
get
to
the
bottom
of
him
when
all
of
a
sudden
we
came
to
a
dean
cockthropple
that
would
be
observed
sir
harry
say
replied
sponge
for
me
well
when
we
got
there
i
thought
we
should
have
some
breathing
time
for
the
fox
would
be
sure
to
hug
it
but
no
no
sooner
had
i
got
there
than
a
countryman
hallooed
him
away
on
the
far
side
i
got
to
the
halloo
as
quick
as
i
could
and
just
as
i
was
blowing
the
horn
producing
watchorn
from
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
i
must
tell
you
said
he
when
i
saw
the
huntsman
horse
was
beat
i
took
this
from
him
a
horn
to
a
foot
huntsman
being
of
no
more
use
you
know
than
a
to
a
cow
or
a
frilled
shirt
to
a
pig
well
as
i
was
tootleing
the
horn
for
hard
life
who
should
turn
out
of
the
wood
but
old
himself
as
you
call
him
and
a
pretty
volley
of
abuse
he
let
drive
at
me
doubt
hiccuped
sir
harry
what
was
doing
there
i
should
tell
you
replied
sponge
hounds
had
run
a
fox
into
it
and
were
on
him
full
cry
when
i
got
there
be
bund
cried
sir
harry
was
all
sham
that
he
just
hiccup
and
excuse
for
getting
into
that
cover
the
old
hiccup
beggar
is
always
at
some
trick
hiccup
my
foxes
or
disturbing
my
covers
or
something
sir
harry
being
just
enough
of
a
master
of
hounds
to
be
jealous
of
the
neighbouring
ones
however
there
he
was
continued
sponge
the
first
intimation
i
had
of
the
fact
was
a
great
gruff
voice
exclaiming
who
the
dickens
are
you
who
the
dickens
are
you
replied
i
shouted
sir
harry
exclaimed
seedeybuck
it
you
cripples
newgate
on
fire
shouted
captain
quod
what
said
he
asked
sir
harry
they
commonly
call
me
the
earl
of
scamperdale
roared
he
and
those
are
my
hounds
they
your
hounds
replied
i
whose
are
they
then
asked
he
sir
harry
scattercash
a
devilish
deal
better
fellow
replied
i
oh
by
jove
roared
he
there
an
end
of
everything
jack
shouted
he
to
old
spraggon
this
gentleman
says
these
are
not
my
hounds
i
tell
you
what
it
is
my
lord
said
i
gathering
my
whip
and
riding
close
up
as
if
i
was
goin
to
pitch
into
him
i
tell
you
what
it
is
you
think
because
you
a
lord
you
may
abuse
people
as
you
like
but
by
jingo
you
mistaken
your
man
i
not
put
up
with
any
of
your
nonsense
the
sponges
are
as
old
a
family
as
the
scamperdales
and
i
fight
you
any
day
you
like
with
pistols
broadswords
fists
or
done
you
bravo
that
your
sort
with
loud
thumping
of
tables
and
clapping
of
hands
resounded
from
all
parts
jove
fill
him
up
a
he
deserves
a
good
drink
after
that
exclaimed
sir
harry
pouring
sponge
out
a
beaker
equal
parts
brandy
and
water
sponge
immediately
became
a
hero
and
was
freely
admitted
into
their
circle
he
was
clearly
a
choice
spirit
a
trump
of
the
first
water
and
they
only
wanted
his
name
to
be
uncommonly
thick
with
him
as
it
was
they
plied
him
with
victuals
and
drink
all
seeming
anxious
to
bring
him
up
to
the
same
happy
state
of
inebriety
as
themselves
they
talked
and
they
chattered
and
they
abused
old
scamperdale
and
jack
spraggon
and
lauded
sponge
up
to
the
skies
thus
day
closed
in
with
farmer
peastraw
bright
fire
shedding
its
cheering
glow
over
the
now
encircling
group
one
would
have
thought
that
with
their
hearts
mellow
and
their
bodies
comfortable
their
minds
would
have
turned
to
that
sport
in
whose
honour
they
sported
the
scarlet
but
no
hunting
was
never
mentioned
they
were
quite
as
genteel
as
nimrod
swell
friends
at
melton
who
cut
it
altogether
they
rambled
from
subject
to
subject
chiefly
on
indoor
and
london
topics
billiards
coal
holes
cremorne
cider
cellars
judge
and
jury
courts
there
being
an
evident
confusion
in
their
minds
between
the
characters
of
sportsmen
and
sporting
men
or
gents
as
they
are
called
sponge
tried
hard
to
get
them
on
the
right
tack
were
it
only
for
the
sake
of
singing
the
praises
of
the
horse
for
which
he
had
so
often
refused
three
hundred
guineas
but
he
never
succeeded
in
retaining
an
hearing
talkers
were
far
more
plentiful
than
listeners
at
last
they
got
to
singing
and
when
men
begin
to
sing
it
is
a
sign
that
they
are
either
drunk
or
have
had
enough
of
each
other
company
sir
harry
hiccup
from
which
he
was
never
wholly
free
increased
tenfold
and
he
hiccuped
and
spluttered
at
almost
every
word
his
hand
which
shook
so
at
starting
that
it
was
odds
whether
he
got
his
glass
to
his
mouth
or
his
ear
was
now
steadied
but
his
glazed
eye
and
green
haggard
countenance
showed
at
what
a
fearful
sacrifice
the
temporary
steadiness
had
been
obtained
at
last
his
jaw
dropped
on
his
chest
his
left
arm
hung
listlessly
over
the
back
of
the
chair
and
he
fell
asleep
captain
quod
too
was
overcome
and
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
captain
seedeybuck
began
to
talk
thick
just
as
they
were
all
about
brought
to
a
standstill
the
trampling
of
horses
the
rumbling
of
wheels
and
the
shrill
twang
twang
twang
of
the
now
almost
forgotten
mail
horn
roused
them
from
their
reveries
it
was
sir
harry
drag
scouring
the
country
in
search
of
our
party
it
had
been
to
all
the
and
within
a
radius
of
some
miles
of
nonsuch
house
and
was
now
taking
a
speculative
blow
through
the
centre
of
the
circle
it
was
a
clear
frosty
night
and
the
horses
hoofs
rang
and
the
wheels
rolled
soundly
over
the
hard
road
cracking
the
thin
ice
yet
hardly
sufficiently
frozen
to
prevent
a
slight
upshot
from
the
wheels
illustration
bugles
prefers
dancing
to
hunting
twang
twang
twang
went
the
horn
full
upon
farmer
peastraw
house
causing
the
sleepers
to
start
and
the
waking
ones
to
make
for
the
window
cried
bob
spangles
smashing
a
pane
in
a
vain
attempt
to
get
the
window
up
the
coachman
pulled
up
at
the
sound
we
are
sir
harry
cried
bob
spangles
into
his
ear
but
sir
harry
was
too
far
gone
he
could
not
to
time
presently
a
footman
entered
with
furred
coats

those
who
were
sufficiently
sober
enveloped
themselves
and
those
who
were
too
far
gone
were
huddled
by
peastraw
and
the
man
and
amid
much
hurry
and
confusion
and
jostling
for
inside
seats
the
party
freighted
the
coach
and
whisked
away
before
sponge
knew
where

was

they
arrived
at

found

a
moonlight
ride
the
position
then
of
sponge
was
this
he
was
left
on
a
frosty
moonlight
night
at
the
door
of
a
strange
farmhouse
staring
after
a
receding
coach
containing
all
his
recent
companions
not
be
goin
wi
then
observed
peastraw
who
stood
beside
him
listening
to
the
shrill
notes
of
the
horn
dying
out
in
the
distance

peastraw
with
a
sneer
diving
his
hands
into
the
depths
of
his
pockets
we
better
go
in
added
he
pulling
his
hands
out
and
rubbing
them
to
betoken
that
he
felt
cold
sponge
not
being
much
of
a
drinker
was
more
overcome
with
what
he
had
taken
than
a
seasoned
cask
would
have
been
added
to
which
the
keen
night
air
striking
upon
his
heated
frame
soon
sent
the
liquor
into
his
head
he
began
to
feel
queer
said
he
to
his

then
go

and
a
half
or
two

till
you
come

at

hoisting
himself
into
the
saddle
and
holding
out
a

take

his

sir
good

peastraw
shaking
it

replied
sponge
riding
off
peastraw
directions
were
well
calculated
to
confuse
a
clearer
head
than
sponge
then
carried
and
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
long
before
he
reached
the
winslow
woods
he
was
regularly
bewildered
indeed
there
is
no
surer
way
of
losing
oneself
than
trying
to
follow
a
long
train
of
directions
in
a
strange
country
it
is
far
better
to
establish
one
own
landmarks
and
make
for
them
as
the
natural
course
of
the
country
seems
to
direct
our
forefathers
had
a
wonderful
knack
of
getting
to
points
with
as
little
circumlocution
as
possible
sponge
however
knew
no
points
and
was
quite
at
sea
indeed
even
if
he
had
they
would
have
been
of
little
use
for
a
fitful
and
frequently
obscured
moon
threw
such
bewildering
lights
and
shades
around
that
a
native
would
have
had
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
country
the
frost
grew
more
intense
the
stars
shone
clear
and
bright
and
the
cold
took
our
friend
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
shooting
across
his
and
right
down
his
back
sponge
wished
and
wished
he
was
anywhere
but
where
he
was
flattening
his
nose
against
the
window
of
the
bantam
tooling
in
a
hansom
as
hard
as
he
could
go
squaring
along
oxford
street
criticizing
horses
nay
he
would
care
to
be
undergoing
gustavus
james
himself
anything
rather
than
rambling
about
a
strange
country
in
a
cold
winter
night
with
nothing
but
the
hooting
of
owls
and
the
occasional
bark
of
shepherds
dogs
to
enliven
his
solitude
the
houses
were
few
and
far
between
the
lights
in
the
cottages
had
long
been
extinguished
and
the
occupiers
of
such
of
the
farmhouses
as
would
come
to
his
knocks
were
gruff
in
their
answers
and
short
in
their
directions
at
length
after
riding
and
riding
and
riding
more
with
a
view
of
keeping
himself
awake
than
in
the
expectation
of
finding
his
way
just
as
he
was
preparing
to
arouse
the
inmates
of
a
cottage
by
the
roadside
a
sudden
gleam
of
moonlight
fell
upon
the
building
revealing
the
lodge
of
puddingpote
bower
chapter
liii
puddingpote
bower
we
must
now
back
the
train
a
little
and
have
a
look
at
jog
and
and
mrs
jog
had
had
another
squabble
after
sponge
departure
in
the
morning
mr
jog
reproving
mrs
jog
for
the
interest
she
seemed
to
take
in
sponge
as
shown
by
her
going
to
the
door
to
see
him
amble
away
on
the
piebald
hack
mrs
jog
justified
herself
on
the
score
of
gustavus
james
with
whom
she
was
quite
sure
sponge
was
much
struck
and
to
whom
she
made
no
doubt
he
would
leave
his
ample
fortune
jog
on
the
other
hand
wheezed
and
puffed
into
his
frill
and
reasserted
that
sponge
was
as
likely
to
live
as
gustavus
james
and
to
marry
and
to
have
a
bushel
of
children
of
his
own
while
mrs
jog
rejoined
that
he
was
to
break
his
neck
breaking
their
necks
being
as
she
conceived
the
inevitable
end
of
jog
who
had
not
prosecuted
the
sport
of
hunting
long
enough
to
be
able
to
gainsay
her
assertion
though
he
took
especial
care
to
defer
the
operation
of
breaking
his
own
neck
as
long
as
he
could
fell
back
upon
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
keeping
sponge
and
his
three
horses
and
his
saucy
servant
who
had
taught
their
domestics
to
turn
up
their
noses
at
his
diet
table
above
all
at
his
and
undeniable
so
they
went
fighting
and
squabbling
on
till
at
last
the
scene
ended
as
usual
by
jogglebury
bursting
into
tears
and
declaring
that
jog
did
care
a
farthing
either
for
her
or
her
children
jog
then
bundled
off
to
try
and
fashion
a
most
knotty
blackthorn
into
a
head
of
lord
chancellor
lyndhurst
he
afterwards
took
a
turn
at
a
hazel
that
he
thought
would
make
a
joe
hume
having
occupied
himself
with
these
till
the
children
he
took
a
wandering
snatching
sort
of
meal
and
then
put
on
his
paletot
with
a
little
hatchet
in
the
pocket
and
went
off
in
search
of
the
raw
material
in
his
own
and
the
neighbouring
hedges
evening
came
and
with
it
came
jog
laden
as
usual
with
an
armful
of
gibbeys
but
the
shades
of
night
followed
evening
ere
there
was
any
tidings
of
the
sporting
inmates
of
his
house
at
length
just
as
jog
was
taking
his
last
stroll
prior
to
going
in
for
good
he
espied
a
pair
of
vacillating
white
breeches
coming
up
the
avenue
with
a
clearly
drunken
man
inside
them
jog
stood
straining
his
eyes
watching
their
movements
wondering
whether
they
would
keep
the
saddle
or
come
off
whenever
the
breeches
seemed
irrevocably
gone
they
invariably
recovered
themselves
with
a
jerk
or
a
lurch
jog
now
saw
it
was
leather
on
the
piebald
and
though
he
had
no
fancy
for
the
man
he
stood
to
let
him
come
up
thinking
to
hear
something
of
sponge
leather
in
due
time
saw
the
great
looming
outline
of
our
friend
and
came
staring
and
shaking
his
head
endeavouring
to
identify
it
he
thought
at
first
it
was
the
squire
next
he
thought
it
was
then
he
was
sure
it
was
it
you
old
boy
is
it
at
last
exclaimed
he
pulling
up
beside
the
large
holly
against
which
our
friend
had
placed
himself
you
old
boy
is
it
repeated
he
extending
his
right
hand
and
nearly
overbalancing
himself
adding
as
he
recovered
his
equilibrium
thought
it
was
the
old
woolpack
at
first
nodding
his
head
towards
the
house
spluttered
he
pulling
up
and
sitting
as
he
thought
quite
straight
in
the
saddle
had
the
finest
day
sport
and
the
most
equitable
drink
i
enjoyed
for
many
a
long
day
bless
us
what
a
gent
that
sir
is
he
the
sort
of
man
that
should
have
money
i
blowed
if
i
were
queen
but
melt
all
the
great
fellows
like
this
crowdey
down
and
make
one
sich
man
as
sir
out
of
the
on
beer
they
know
wot
beer
is
there
nothin
but
the
werry
strongest
hale
instead
of
the
puzzon
one
gets
at
this
awful
mean
place
that
looks
like
nothin
but
the
weshin
o
brewers
haprons
oh
i
begs
pardon
exclaimed
he
dropping
from
his
horse
on
to
his
knees
on
discovering
that
he
was
addressing
crowdey
thought
it
was
robins
the
it
was
robins
the
growled
jog
have
you
to
do
with
puff
robins
the
wheeze
jog
boiled
over
with
indignation
at
first
he
thought
of
kicking
leather
a
feat
that
his
suppliant
position
made
extremely
convenient
if
not
tempting
prudence
however
suggested
that
leather
might
have
him
up
for
the
assault
so
he
stood
puffing
and
wheezing
and
eyeing
the
old
drunkard
with
as
he
thought
a
withering
look
of
contempt
and
then
though
the
man
was
drunk
and
the
night
was
dark
he
waddled
off
leaving
leather
on
his
once
white
breeches
knees
if
jog
had
had
reasonable
time
say
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
twenty
minutes
to
improvise
it
in
he
would
have
said
something
uncommonly
sharp
as
it
was
he
left
him
with
the
pertinent
inquiry
we
have
recorded
have
you
to
do
with
robins
the
we
need
hardly
say
that
this
little
incident
did
not
at
all
ingratiate
sponge
with
his
host
who
his
house
in
a
worse
humour
than
ever
it
was
insulting
a
gentleman
on
his
own
bearding
an
englishman
in
his
own
castle
to
be
borne
puff
said
jog
it
was
now
nearly
five
jog
dinner
hour
and
still
no
sponge
mrs
jog
proposed
waiting
half
an
hour
indeed
she
had
told
susan
the
cook
to
keep
the
dinner
back
a
little
to
give
sponge
a
chance
who
could
not
possibly
change
his
tight
hunting
things
for
his
evening
tights
in
the
short
space
of
time
that
jog
could
drop
off
his
garments
wash
his
hands
and
run
the
comb
through
his
lank
hair
five
struck
and
jog
was
just
applying
his
hand
to
the
fat
worsted
when
mrs
jog
announced
what
she
had
done
off
the
dinner
wheeze
put
off
the
dinner
puff
repeated
he
blowing
furiously
into
his
clean
which
stuck
up
under
his
nose
like
a
off
the
dinner
wheeze
put
off
the
dinner
puff
i
wish
you
would
do
such
wheeze
things
without
consulting
gasp
me
but
my
dear
you
could
possibly
sit
down
without
him
observed
mrs
jog
mildly
puff
possibly
wheeze
repeated
jog
no
possibly
in
the
matter
retorted
he
blowing
more
furiously
into
the
frill
mrs
jog
was
silent
man
should
conform
to
the
puff
hours
of
the
wheeze
house
observed
jog
after
a
pause
but
my
dear
you
know
hunters
are
always
allowed
a
little
law
observed
mrs
jog
puff
law
wheeze
retorted
jog
never
want
any
law
thinking
of
smiler
jogglebury
five
came
and
still
no
sponge
and
mrs
jog
thinking
it
would
be
better
to
arrange
to
have
something
hot
for
him
when
he
came
than
to
do
further
battle
with
her
husband
gave
the
bell
the
double
ring
indicative
of
dinner
puff
nay
wheeze
when
you
have
gasp
ed
so
long
growled
jog
taking
the
other
tack
might
as
well
have
wheez
ed
a
little
longer
snorting
into
his
frill
as
he
spoke
jogglebury
said
nothing
but
slipped
quietly
out
as
if
after
her
keys
to
tell
susan
to
keep
in
the
and
have
a
few
potatoes
ready
to
boil
against
sponge
arrived
she
then
sidled
back
quietly
into
the
room
jog
and
she
presently
proceeded
to
that
meal
jog
blowing
out
the
company
candles
on
the
as
he
passed
jog
munched
away
with
a
capital
appetite
but
mrs
jog
who
took
the
bulk
of
her
lading
in
at
the
children
dinner
sat
trifling
with
the
contents
of
her
plate
listening
alternately
for
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
outside
and
for
nursery
squalls
in
dinner
passed
over
and
the
fruity
port
and
sugary
sherry
soon
usurped
the
places
that
pudding
and
cheese
had
occupied
puff
sponge
must
be
wheeze
i
think
observed
jog
hauling
his
great
silver
watch
out
like
a
bucket
from
his
fob
on
seeing
that
it
only
wanted
ten
minutes
to
seven
jog
exclaimed
mrs
jog
clasping
her
beautiful
hands
and
casting
her
bright
beady
eyes
up
to
the
low
ceiling
jog
what
the
matter
now
puff
wheeze
gasp
exclaimed
our
friend
reddening
up
and
fixing
his
stupid
eyes
intently
on
his
wife
nothing
replied
mrs
jog
unclasping
her
hands
and
bringing
down
her
eyes
nothin
retorted
jog
repeated
he
do
get
into
such
tantrums
for
nothin
then
jog
i
was
thinking
if
anything
should
have
ha
ha
happened
sponge
how
gustavus
ja
ja
james
will
have
lost
his
chance
and
thereupon
she
dived
for
her
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
but
mrs
jog
had
said
quite
enough
to
make
the
caldron
of
jog
jealousy
boil
over
and
he
sat
staring
into
the
fire
imagining
all
sorts
of
horrible
devices
in
the
coals
and
cinders
and
conjuring
up
all
sorts
of
evils
until
he
felt
himself
possessed
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
devils
get
shot
of
this
chap
at
last
said
he
with
a
knowing
jerk
of
his
head
and
a
puff
into
his
frill
as
he
drew
his
thick
legs
under
his
chair
and
made
a
to
get
at
the
bottle
get
shot
of
this
chap
repeated
he
pouring
himself
out
a
bumper
of
the
syrupy
port
and
eyeing
it
at
the
composite
candle
he
drained
off
the
glass
and
immediately
filled
another
that
too
went
down
then
he
took
another
and
another
and
another
and
seeing
the
bottle
get
low
he
thought
he
might
as
well
finish
it
he
felt
better
after
it
not
that
he
was
a
bit
more
reconciled
to
our
friend
sponge
but
he
felt
more
equal
to
cope
with
him
he
even
felt
as
if
he
could
fight
him
there
did
not
however
seem
to
be
much
likelihood
of
his
having
to
perform
that
ceremony
for
nine
struck
and
no
sponge
and
at
crowdey
stumped
off
to
bed
crowdey
having
given
bartholomew
and
susan
a
dirty
pack
of
cards
to
play
with
to
keep
them
awake
till
sponge
arrived
went
to
bed
too
and
the
house
was
presently
tranquil
it
however
happened
that
that
amazing
prodigy
gustavus
james
having
been
out
on
a
sort
of
eleemosynary
excursion
among
the
neighbouring
farmers
and
people
exhibiting
as
well
his
fine
hat
as
his
astonishing
proficiency
in
bah
black
sheep
and
and
ichard
getting
from
one
sponge
cake
from
another
and
toffy
from
a
third
was
troubled
with
a
very
bad
during
the
night
of
which
he
soon
made
the
house
sensible
by
his
screams
and
his
cries
jog
and
his
wife
were
presently
at
him
and
as
jog
sat
in
his
white
cotton
nightcap
and
flowing
flannel
in
an
easy
chair
in
the
nursery
he
heard
the
crack
of
the
whip
and
the
prolonged

the

passed
round

from

presently
the
shooting

bolts
the
withdrawal

and
the
opening

were
heard

gone

asked

in

voice

the

looked
upon
his

jogglebury
crowdey
returned
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
sleep
there
was
none
for
him
he
was
full
of
indignation
and
jealousy
and
felt
suspicious
of
the
very
bolster
itself
he
had
been
insulted
grossly
insulted
three
such
names
the
and
no
gentleman
surely
ever
was
called
before
by
a
guest
in
his
own
house
called
too
before
his
own
servant
what
veneration
what
respect
could
a
servant
feel
for
a
master
whom
he
heard
called
it
damaged
the
respect
inspired
by
the
chairmanship
of
the
union
to
say
nothing
of
the
trusteeship
of
the
sloppyhocks
tolpuddle
and
other
it
annihilated
everything
so
he
fumed
and
fretted
and
snorted
and
snored
worst
of
all
he
had
no
one
to
whom
he
could
unburden
his
grievance
he
could
not
make
the
partner
of
his
bosom
a
partner
in
his
woes
because
and
he
bounced
about
so
that
he
almost
shot
the
clothes
off
the
bed
at
the
thoughts
of
the
thus
he
lay
tumbling
and
tossing
and
fuming
and
wheezing
and
puffing
now
vowing
vengeance
against
leather
who
he
recollected
had
called
him
the
and
determining
to
have
him
turned
off
in
the
morning
for
his
impudence
now
devising
schemes
for
getting
rid
of
sponge
and
him
together
oh
could
he
but
see
them
off
could
he
but
see
the
portmanteau
and
again
standing
in
the
passage
he
would
gladly
lend
his
phaeton
to
carry
them
anywhere
he
would
drive
it
himself
for
the
pleasure
of
knowing
and
feeling
he
was
clear
of
them
he
would
haggle
about
the
pikes
nay
he
would
even
give
sponge
a
gibbey
any
he
liked
the
pick
of
the
whole
wellington
napoleon
bonaparte
a
crowned
head
even
though
it
would
damage
the
set
so
he
lay
rolling
and
restless
hearing
every
clock
strike
now
trying
to
divert
his
thoughts
by
making
a
rough
calculation
what
all
his
gibbeys
put
together
were
worth
now
considering
whether
he
had
forgotten
to
go
for
any
he
had
marked
in
the
course
of
his
peregrinations
now
wishing
he
had
laid
one
about
old
leather
when
he
fell
on
his
knees
after
calling
him
the
then
wondering
whether
leather
would
have
had
him
before
the
county
court
for
damages
or
taken
him
before
justice
slowcoach
for
the
assault
as
morning
advanced
his
thoughts
again
turned
upon
the
best
mode
of
getting
rid
of
his
most
unwelcome
guests
and
he
arose
and
dressed
with
the
full
determination
of
trying
what
he
could
do
having
tried
the
effects
of
an
upstairs
shout
the
morning
before
he
decided
to
see
what
a
down
one
would
do
accordingly
he
mounted
the
stairs
and
climbed
the
sort
of
that
led
to
the
servants
attics
where
he
kept
a
stock
of
gibbeys
in
the
rafters
having
reached
this
he
cleared
his
throat
laid
his
head
over
the
banisters
and
putting
an
open
hand
on
each
side
of
his
mouth
to
direct
the
sound
exclaimed
with
a
loud
and
audible
voice
e
tho
lo
e
e
repeated
he
after
a
pause
with
a
full
separation
of
the
syllables
and
a
prolonged
intonation
of
the
e
no
bartholomew
answered
ann
then
hallooed
jog
in
a
sharper
quicker
key
ann
repeated
he
still
louder
after
a
pause
sir
here
sir
exclaimed
that
invaluable
servant
tidying
her
cap
as
she
hurried
into
the
passage
below
looking
up
she
caught
sight
of
her
master
great
sallow
chaps
hanging
like
a
flitch
of
bacon
over
the
garret
banister
murry
ann
bellowed
mr
jog
at
the
top
of
his
voice
still
holding
his
hands
to
his
mouth
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
murry
ann

replied
mary
ann
raising
her
voice
to
correspond
with
that
of
her
master

replied
mr

in
the

tone

then
just

rejoined
jog
adding
be
wheezing
away
as
soon
as
he
gets
it
i
puff
expect
he
said
sponge
to
himself
as
with
throbbing
head
he
lay
tumbling
about
in
bed
alleviating
the
recollections
of
the
previous
debauch
with
an
occasional
dive
into
his
old
friend
corporeally
he
was
in
bed
at
puddingpote
bower
but
mentally
he
was
at
the
door
of
the
goose
and
gridiron
in
paul
churchyard
waiting
for
the
three
bus
coming
from
the
bank
to
take
him
to
isleworth
gate
jog
bellow
to
e
interrupted
the
journey
just
as
in
imagination
sponge
was
putting
his
foot
on
the
wheel
and
hallooing
to
the
driver
to
hand
him
the
strap
to
help
him
on
to
the
box
he
said
sponge
to
himself
as
he
heard
jog
reiterated
assertion
that
he
would
be
wheezing
away
that
day
you
may
get
it
old
boy
added
he
tucking
the
now
backless
under
his
pillow
and
turning
over
for
a
snooze
when
he
got
down
he
found
the
party
ranged
at
breakfast
minus
the
interesting
prodigy
gustavus
james
whom
sponge
proceeded
to
inquire
after
as
soon
as
he
had
made
his
obeisance
to
his
host
and
hostess
and
distributed
a
round
of
daubed
comfits
to
the
rest
of
the
juvenile
party
where
my
little
friend
augustus
james
asked
he
on
arriving
at
the
wonder
high
chair
by
the
side
of
mamma
my
little
friend
augustus
james
asked
he
with
an
air
of
concern
james
replied
mrs
jog
with
an
emphasis
on
gustavus
james
is
not
very
well
this
morning
had
a
little
indigestion
during
the
night
little
hound
observed
sponge
filling
his
mouth
with
hot
kidney
glad
to
be
rid
for
a
time
of
the
prodigy
thought
i
heard
a
row
when
i
came
home
which
was
rather
late
for
an
early
man
like
me
but
the
fact
was
nothing
would
serve
sir
harry
but
i
should
go
with
him
to
get
some
refreshment
at
a
tenant
of
his
and
we
got
on
talking
first
about
one
thing
and
then
about
another
and
the
time
slipped
away
so
quickly
that
day
was
gone
before
i
knew
where
i
was
and
though
sir
harry
was
most
anxious
indeed
would
hardly
take
a
refusal
for
me
to
go
home
with
him
i
felt
that
being
a
guest
here
i
could
do
it
at
least
not
then
so
i
got
my
horse
and
tried
to
find
my
way
with
such
directions
as
the
farmer
gave
me
and
soon
lost
my
way
for
the
moon
was
uncertain
and
the
country
all
strange
both
to
me
and
my
horse
farmer
was
it
asked
jog
with
the
butter
streaming
down
the
gutters
of
his
chin
from
a
mouthful
of
thick
toast
farmer
farmer
let
me
see
what
farmer
it
was
replied
sponge
thoughtfully
again
attacking
the
kidneys
farmer
beanstraw
i
should
say
suggested
jog
colouring
up
and
staring
intently
at
sponge
peastraw
was
the
name
replied
sponge
know
him
said
jog
of
stoke
he
said
he
knew
you
replied
sponge
he
asked
jog
eagerly
did
he
say
let
me
see
what
he
said
replied
he
pretending
to
recollect
he
said
you
are
a
deuced
good
feller
and
i
to
make
his
compliments
to
you
and
to
say
that
there
were
some
nice
young
ash
saplings
on
his
farm
that
you
were
welcome
to
cut
he
exclaimed
jog
sure
that
very
puff
polite
of
him
wheeze
over
there
the
first
opportunity
what
did
you
make
of
sir
harry
asked
mrs
jog
you
puff
say
you
were
going
to
wheeze
over
to
him
asked
jog
eagerly
told
him
i
go
to
him
before
i
left
the
country
replied
sponge
carelessly
adding
harry
is
rather
too
fast
a
man
for
me
fast
for
himself
i
should
think
observed
mrs
jog
puff
wheeze
young
man
growled
jog
into
the
bottom
of
his
cup
you
known
him
long
asked
jogglebury
we
all
know
each
other
replied
sponge
evasively
now
that
what
i
tell
jogglebury
exclaimed
she
jog
so
shy
that
there
no
getting
him
to
do
what
he
ought
added
the
lady
one
to
hear
him
would
think
he
the
great
man
he
is
puff
ought
wheeze
retorted
jog
puffing
furiously
into
his
capacious
one
puff
thing
to
know
puff
people
out
with
the
wheeze
hounds
and
another
to
go
calling
upon
them
at
their
gasp
houses
but
my
dear
that
the
way
people
make
acquaintance
replied
his
wife
it
mr
sponge
continued
she
appealing
to
our
friend
certainly
replied
sponge
all
men
are
equal
out
hunting
i
say
exclaimed
jogglebury
yet
i
ca
get
jog
to
call
on
sir
george
stiff
though
he
meets
him
frequently
out
hunting
but
then
i
ca
puff
upon
him
out
hunting
wheeze
and
then
we
not
all
equal
gasp
when
we
go
home
so
saying
our
friend
rose
from
his
chair
and
after
giving
each
leg
its
usual
shake
and
banging
his
pockets
behind
to
feel
that
he
had
his
keys
safe
he
strutted
consequentially
up
to
the
window
to
see
how
the
day
looked
sponge
not
being
desirous
of
continuing
the
controversy
especially
as
it
might
lead
to
inquiries
relative
to
his
acquaintance
with
sir
harry
finished
the
contents
of
his
plate
quickly
drank
up
his
tea
and
was
presently
alongside
of
his
host
asking
him
whether
he
good
for
a
ride
a
walk
or
what
puff
ride
a
wheeze
walk
or
a
gasp
what
repeated
jog
thoughtfully
i
puff
think
i
stay
at
puff
home
thinking
that
would
be
the
safest
plan
hang
it
you
never
lie
at
earth
such
a
day
as
this
exclaimed
sponge
looking
out
on
the
bright
sunny
landscape
a
great
deal
to
do
retorted
jog
who
like
all
thoroughly
idle
men
was
always
dreadfully
busy
he
then
dived
into
a
bundle
of
rough
sticks
and
proceeded
to
select
one
to
fashion
into
the
head
of
hume
sponge
being
unable
to
make
anything
of
him
was
obliged
to
exhaust
the
day
in
the
stable
and
in
sauntering
about
the
country
it
was
clear
jog
was
determined
to
be
rid
of
him
and
he
was
sadly
puzzled
what
to
do
dinner
found
his
host
in
no
better
humour
and
after
a
sort
of
quakers
meeting
of
an
evening
they
parted
heartily
sick
of
each
other
chapter
lv
the
trigger
jog
slept
badly
again
and
arose
next
morning
full
of
projects
for
getting
rid
of
his
impudent
unceremonious
guest
having
tried
both
an
up
and
a
downstairs
shout
he
now
went
out
and
planted
himself
immediately
under
sponge
bedroom
window
and
clearing
his
voice
commenced
his
usual
vociferations
e
whined
he
m
e
repeated
he
somewhat
louder
tholo
e
roared
he
in
a
voice
of
thunder
bartholomew
did
not
answer
ann
exclaimed
jog
after
a
pause
ann
repeated
he
still
louder
ann
roared
he
at
the
top
of
his
voice
sir
comin
exclaimed
mary
ann
peeping
down
upon
him
from
the
murry
ann
cried
mr
jog
looking
up
and
catching
the
ends
of
her
blue
ribbons
streaming
past
the
as
she
changed
her
nightcap
for
a
day
one
murry
ann
you
better
be
puff
in
forrard
with
the
gasp
breakfast
sponge
most
likely
be
wheeze
in
away
sir
replied
mary
ann
adjusting
the
cap
becomingly
puffing
wheezing
gasping
old
blockhead
it
is
growled
sponge
wishing
he
could
get
to
his
former
earth
at
puffington
or
anywhere
else
when
he
got
down
he
found
jog
in
a
very
roomy
bright
with
pockets
innumerable
and
a
whistle
suspended
to
a
his
nether
man
was
encased
in
a
pair
of
most
dilapidated
white
moleskins
that
had
been
degraded
from
hunting
into
shooting
ones
and
whose
cracks
and
darns
showed
the
perils
to
which
their
wearer
had
been
exposed
below
these
were
drab
gaiters
and
shoes
are
you
asked
sponge
after
the
morning
salutation
which
jog
returned
most
gruffly
go
with
you
said
sponge
at
once
dispelling
the
delusion
of
his
wheezing
away
going
to
frighten
the
puff
rooks
off
the
gasp
wheat
replied
jog
carelessly
not
wishing
to
let
sponge
see
what
a
numb
hand
he
was
with
a
gun
thought
you
told
me
you
were
going
to
get
me
a
hare
observed
mrs
jog
adding
sure
shooting
is
a
much
more
rational
amusement
than
tearing
your
clothes
going
after
the
hounds
eyeing
the
much
dilapidated
moleskins
as
she
spoke
mrs
jog
found
shooting
more
useful
than
hunting
if
a
puff
hare
comes
in
my
gasp
way
i
turn
her
over
replied
jog
carelessly
as
if
turning
them
over
was
quite
a
matter
of
course
with
him
adding
i
not
wheezing
out
for
the
express
purpose
of
shooting
one
well
observed
sponge
go
with
you
all
the
same
i
only
got
one
gun
gasped
jog
thinking
it
would
be
worse
to
have
sponge
laughing
at
his
shooting
than
even
leaving
him
at
home
we
shoot
turn
and
turn
about
replied
the
pertinacious
guest
jog
did
his
best
to
dissuade
him
observing
that
the
birds
were
puff
scarce
and
wheeze
wild
and
the
gasp
hares
much
troubled
with
poachers
but
sponge
wanted
a
walk
and
moreover
had
a
fancy
for
seeing
jog
handle
his
gun
having
cut
himself
some
extremely
substantial
sandwiches
and
filled
his
full
of
sherry
our
friend
jog
slipped
out
the
back
way
to
loosen
old
ponto
who
acted
the
triple
part
of
pointer
and
horse
to
gustavus
james
he
was
a
great
fat
brute
with
a
head
like
a
a
tail
like
a
and
a
back
as
broad
as
a
sheep
the
old
brute
was
so
frantic
at
the
sight
of
his
master
in
his
green
coat
and
to
match
that
he
jumped
and
bounced
and
barked
and
rattled
his
chain
and
set
up
such
yells
that
his
noise
sounded
all
over
the
house
and
soon
brought
sponge
to
the
scene
of
action
where
stood
our
friend
loading
his
gun
and
looking
as
consequential
as
possible
shall
only
just
take
a
puff
stroll
over
moy
wheeze
observed
jog
as
sponge
emerged
at
the
back
door
illustration
frantic
delight
of
ponto
jog
pace
was
about
two
miles
and
a
half
an
hour
stoppages
included
and
he
thought
it
advisable
to
prepare
sponge
for
the
trial
he
then
shouldered
his
gun
and
waddled
away
first
over
the
stile
into
farmer
stiffland
stubble
round
which
ponto
ranged
in
the
most
riotous
independent
way
regardless
of
jog
whistles
and
rates
and
the
crack
of
his
little
knotty
whip
jog
then
crossed
the
old

on

and
brought
him
to
a
more
subdued
pace
still
the

had
a
good
deal
more
energy
than
his
master
round
he
went
sniffing
and
hunting
then
dashing
right
through
the
middle
of
the
field
as
if
he
was
out
on

having

began
to

in

stop
flap
their

of

he
always
let
drive
far

even
if
he
shot
a

which
he
sometimes
did
with

he
always
popped

thinking
it
better
to

most
energetically
the

was
left
behind
till
the

scuttled
out
of

he
wheeled
about
and
came
leisurely
back
as
if
he
was
doing
all
right

was
very
wroth
and
vented
his
anger
on
the
dog
which
he
declared
had
caused
him
to
miss
vowing
as
he
rammed
away
at
the
charge
that
he
never
missed
such
a
shot
before
sponge
stood
eyeing
him
with
a
look
of
incredulity
thinking
that
a
man
who
could
miss
such
a
shot
could
miss
anything
they
were
now
all
ready
for
a
fresh
start
and

having
pocketed
his
objurgation
dashed
forward
again
up
the
rising
ground
over
which
the
covey
had
dropped
jog
thick
wind
was
a
serious
impediment
to
the
expeditious
mounting
of
the
hill
and
the
dog
seemed
aware
of
his
infirmity
and
to
take
pleasure
in
aggravating
him
gasped
jog
as
he
slipped
and
scrambled
and
toiled
sorely
impeded
by
the
encumbrance
of
his

heeded
him
not

knew
his

catch

if

durst
flog
him
gasped
jog
again
still
louder
catching
at
a
bush
to
prevent
his
slipping

he
but
the
dog
just
rolled
his

and
bustled
about
more
actively

replied
sponge
whistling
and
eyeing
the
independent
animal
gasped
jog
as
he
dashed
forward
on
reaching
level
ground
more
eagerly
than
ever
repeated
he
in
a
still
louder
tone
with
the

success

however
blundered
on
at

the

was
now
fast
drawing
upon
where
the
birds
lit
and
sponge
and
jog
having
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
sponge
stood
still
to
watch
the
result
up
whirred
four
birds
out
of
a
patch
of
gorse
behind
the
dog
all
presenting
most
beautiful
shots
jog
blazed
a
barrel
at
them
without
touching
a
feather
and
the
report
of
the
gun
immediately
raised
three
brace
more
into
the
thick
of
which
he
fired
with
similar
success
they
all
skimmed
away
unhurt

exclaimed
sponge
again
what
they
call
a
good
shooter
but
a
bad
hitter
what
they
call
a
wheeze
fellow
growled
jog
he
meant
to
say
but
the
word
would
rise
he
then
commenced
reloading
his
gun
and
lecturing
who
still
continued
his
exertions
and
inwardly
anathematizing
sponge
he
wished
he
had
left
him
at
home
then
recollecting
mrs
jog
he
thought
perhaps
he
was
as
well
where
he
was
still
his
presence
made
him
shoot
worse
than
usual
and
there
was
no
occasion
for
that
have
a
shot
now
said
sponge
puff
shot
wheeze
well
take
a
shot
if
you
choose
replied
he
just
as
sponge
got
the
gun
up
rose
the
eleventh
bird
and
he
knocked
it
over

sponge
gives
ponto
a
lesson
the
way
to
do
it
exclaimed
sponge
as
the
bird
fell
dead
before
ponto
the
excited
dog
unused
to
such
descents
snatched
it
up
and
ran
off
just
as
he
was
getting
out
of
shot
sponge
fired
the
other
barrel
at
him
causing
him
to
drop
the
bird
and
run
yelping
and
howling
away
jog
was
furious
he
stamped
and
gasped
and
fumed
and
wheezed
and
seemed
like
to
burst
with
anger
and
indignation
though
the
dog
ran
away
as
hard
as
he
could
lick
jog
insisted
that
he
was
mortally
wounded
and
would
die
never
saw
so
wheeze
a

done
he
would
have
taken
twenty
pounds
for

no
he
would

forty
would
have

him
he
was
worth
fifty
of
anybody
money
and
so
he
went
on
fuming
and
advancing
his
value
as
he
spoke
sponge
stole
away
to
where
the
dog
had
dropped
the
bird
and
mr
jog
availing
himself
of
his
absence
retraced
his
steps
down
the
hill
and
struck
off
home
at
a
much
faster
pace
than
he
came
arrived
there
he
found
the
dog
in
the
kitchen
somewhat
sore
from
the
visitation
of
the
shot
but
not
sufficiently
injured
to
prevent
his
enjoying
a
most
liberal
plate
of
pudding
supplied
by
a
general
contribution
of
the
servants
wrath
was
then
turned
in
another
direction
and
he
blew
up
for
the
waste
and
extravagance
of
the
act
hinting
pretty
freely
that
he
knew
who
it
was
that
had
set
them
against
it
altogether
he
was
full
of
troubles
vexations
and
annoyances
and
after
spending
another
most
disagreeable
evening
with
our

his
hints
the
next
morning
after

prefatory
anns
and
he
at
length
got
the
latter
to
answer
when
raising
his
voice
so
as
to
fill
the
whole
house
he
desired
him
to
go
to

old
buck
growled
leather
as
he
heard
the
foregoing
to

by
this
time
and
sure
enough
sponge
was
as
none
knew
better
than
leather
who
had
got
him
his
horse

hack
being
indisposed
that
is
to
say
having
been
out
all
night
with
leather
on
a
drinking
excursion

having
just
got
home
in
time
to
receive
the
runner
of
nonsuch
house
who
dropped
in
to
see
if
there
was
anything
to
stow
away
in
his
roomy
and
leave
word
that
sir
harry
was
going
to
hunt
and
would
meet
before
the
house
leather
though
somewhat
muzzy
was
sufficiently
sober
to
be
able
to
deliver
this
message
and
acquaint
sponge
with
the
impossibility
of
his
the
indeed
he
truly
said
that
he
had
hup
with
him
all
night
and
at
one
time
thought
it
was
all

with
him

consisting
of

being
nearly
all
over
the
head
in
consequence
of
the
animal
shying
at
another
drunken
man
lying
across
the
road
sponge
listened
to
the
recital
with
the
indifference
of
a
man
who
rides
and
coolly
observed
that
leather
must
take
on
the
chestnut
and
he
would
ride
the
brown
to
cover
sir
could
replied
leather
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
a
twinkle
of
his
roguish
watery
grey
eyes
not
asked
sponge
who
never
saw
any

replied
leather
in
a
tone
of
despondency

be
quite
unpossible

wot
a

the
last
one
was
why
he
did

along
with
a
flourish

to
crawl
if
you
ride

leather
not
walk
bless
you

been
of

and
the
most
the
night
replied
sponge
who
began
to
be
alarmed
lest
his
hunting
might
be
brought
to
an
abrupt
termination
as
i
rejoined
leather
just
as
much
off
his
grub
as

vos
when

com

interrupting
the

sponge
tired
of
his
loquacity
it
a

repeated
leather
thoughtfully
it
a

vy
no
i
should
say
it
a
frost
at

not
a
frost
to
there
may
be
a
little
rind
on
the
ground
and
a
little
rawness
in
the
hair
but
the
general
concatenation
tout
exclaimed
sponge
have
none
of
your
dictionary
words
leather
stood
silent
twisting
his
hat
about
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
that
sponge
determined
to
ride
over
to
nonsuch
house
to
breakfast
which
would
give
his
horse
half
an
hour
in
the
stable
to
eat
a
feed
of
corn
accordingly
he
desired
leather
to
bring
him
his
and
have
the
horse
ready
in
the
stable
in
half
an
hour
whither
in
due
time
sponge
emerged
by
the
back
door
without
encountering
any
of
the
family
the
ambling
piebald
looked
so
crestfallen
and
woebegone
in
all
the
in
which
leather
had
got
him
enveloped
that
sponge
did
not
care
to
look
at
the
gallant
hercules
who
occupied
a
temporary
at
the
far
end
of
the
dark
stable
lest
he
might
look
worse
he
therefore
just
mounted
as
leather
led
him
out
at
the
door
and
set
off
without
a
word
hang
me
but
you
are
a
good
judge
of
weather
exclaimed
sponge
to
himself
as
he
got
into
the
field
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
found
the
horse
made
little
impression
on
the
grass
frost
repeated
he
breathing
into
the
air
it
freezing
now
out
of
the
sun
on
getting
into
marygold
lane
our
friend
drew
rein
and
was
for
turning
back
but
the
resolute
chestnut
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
shook
his
head
as
if
determined
to
go
on
you
brute
growled
sponge
letting
the
spurs
into
his
sides
with
a
hearty
which
caused
the
animal
to
kick
as
if
he
meant
to
stand
on
his
head
you
will
ye
exclaimed
sponge
letting
the
spurs
in
again
as
the
animal
replaced
his
legs
on
the
ground
up
they
went
again
if
possible
higher
than
before
the
brute
was
clearly
full
of
mischief
and
even
if
the
hounds
did
not
throw
off
which
there
was
little
prospect
of
their
doing
from
the
appearance
of
the
weather
sponge
felt
that
it
would
be
well
to
get
some
of
the
nonsense
taken
out
of
him
and
moreover
going
to
nonsuch
house
would
give
him
a
chance
of
establishing
a
billet
there
a
chance
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
by
sir
harry
abrupt
departure
from
farmer
peastraw
so
saying
our
friend
gathered
his
horse
together
and
settling
himself
in
his
saddle
made
his
sound
hoofs
ring
upon
the
hard
road
hunt
thought
sponge
as
he
rattled
along
a
rum
beggar
as
sir
harry
may
think
it
fun
to
go
out
in
a
frost
it
hard
too
said
he
as
he
saw
the
poor
enveloped
in
their
thick
shawls
and
watched
them
thumping
their
arms
against
their
sides
to
drive
the
cold
from
their
was
a
good
horse
hard
and
firm
as
a
a
horse
that
would
not
turn
a
hair
for
a
trifle
even
on
a
hunting
morning
let
alone
on
such
a
thorough
chiller
as
this
one
was
and
sponge
after
going
along
at
a
good
round
pace
and
getting
over
the
ground
much
quicker
than
he
did
when
the
road
was
all
new
to
him
and
he
had
to
ask
his
way
at
length
drew
in
to
see
what
it
was
it
was
only
nine
and
already
in
the
far
distance
he
saw
the
encircling
woods
of
nonsuch
house
be
early
said
sponge
returning
his
watch
to
his
and
diving
into
his
cutty
for
the
having
struck
a
light
he
now
laid
the
rein
on
the
horse
neck
and
proceeded
leisurely
along
the
animal
stepping
gaily
and
throwing
its
head
about
as
if
he
was
the
quietest
most
trustworthy
nag
in
the
world
if
he
got
there
at
ten
sponge
calculated
he
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
see
after
his
horse
get
his
own
breakfast
and
see
how
the
land
lay
for
a
billet
it
would
be
impossible
to
hunt
before
twelve
so
he
went
smoking
and
sauntering
along
now
wondering
whether
he
would
be
able
to
establish
a
billet
now
thinking
how
he
would
like
to
sell
sir
harry
a
horse
then
considering
whether
he
would
be
likely
to
pay
for
him
and
enlivening
the
general
reflections
by
ringing
his
spurs
against
his
having
passed
the
lodges
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
he
cocked
his
hat
twiddled
his
hair
felt
his
tie
and
arranged
for
a
becoming
appearance
the
sudden
turn
of
the
road
brought
him
full
upon
the
house
how
changed
the
scene
instead
of
the
youths
thronging
the
gravelled
ring
flourishing
their
scented
kerchiefs
and
instead
of
buxom
abigails
and
handsome
mistresses
hanging
out
of
the
windows
flirting
and
chatting
and
ogling
the
door
was
shut
the
blinds
were
down
the
shutters
closed
and
the
whole
house
had
the
appearance
of
mourning
sponge
reined
up
involuntarily
startled
at
the
change
of
scene
what
could
have
happened
could
sir
harry
be
dead
could
my
lady
have
eloped
that
horrid
bugles
thought
he
looked
like
a
gay
deceiver
and
sponge
felt
as
if
he
had
sustained
a
personal
injury
just
as
these
thoughts
were
passing
in
his
mind
a
drowsy
slatternly
charwoman
in
an
old
black
straw
bonnet
and
grey
opened
one
of
the
shutters
and
throwing
up
the
sash
of
the
window
by
where
sponge
sat
disclosed
the
contents
of
the
apartment
the
last
waxlight
was
just
dying
out
in
the
centre
of
a
splendid
candelabra
on
the
middle
of
a
table
scattered
about
with
glasses
decanters
tops
cakes
plates
devilled
all
the
concomitants
of
a
sumptuous
entertainment
harry
at
home
asked
sponge
making
the
woman
sensible
of
his
presence
by
cracking
his
whip
close
to
her
ear
replied
the
dame
gruffly
commencing
an
assault
upon
the
nearest
chair
with
a
duster
is
he
asked
our
friend
to
be
sure
replied
the
woman
in
the
same
tone
illustration
sponge
red
coat
commands
no
respect
to
be
sure
repeated
sponge
do
think
there
any
in
the
case
do
you
know
what
it
is
asked
he
replied
the
woman
flopping
away
at
another
chair
and
arranging
the
crimson
velvet
curtains
on
the
holders
sponge
was
rather
nonplussed
his
red
coat
did
not
command
the
respect
that
a
red
coat
generally
does
the
fact
was
they
had
such
queer
people
in
red
coats
at
nonsuch
house
that
a
red
coat
was
rather
an
object
of
suspicion
than
otherwise
but
my
good
woman
continued
sponge
softening
his
tone
you
tell
me
where
i
shall
find
anybody
who
can
tell
me
anything
about
the
hounds
growled
the
woman
still
flopping
and
whisking
and
knocking
the
furniture
about
remember
you
for
your
trouble
observed
sponge
diving
his
right
hand
into
his
breeches

gone

observed
the
woman
now
ceasing
her
evolutions
and
parting
her
grisly
disordered
tresses
as
she
advanced
and
stood
staring
with
her
arms
akimbo
out
of
the
window
she
was
the
deputy
all
the
servants
at
nonsuch
house
doing
the
rough
of
their
work
by

a
lady
and
liked
to
have
the
credit
of

of
course

only
be
done
by
letting
the
upper
servants
do
nothing

observed
the

repeated

replied
she
astonished
that
any
person
should
have
to
ask
who
such
an
important
personage
was

call
him
asked
sponge
still
fumbling
in
his
pocket
if
it
was
ever
so
replied
the
dame
smoothing
her
dirty
apron
with
her
still
dirtier
hand
not
asked
sponge
not
repeated
the
woman

be
disturbed
by

said
when
he
went
to

then
observed
she
again
giving
symptoms
of
a
desire
to
return
to
her
dusting
sponge
who
still
kept
his
hand
in
his
pocket
sat
on
his
horse
in
a
state
of
stupid
bewilderment
he
had
never
seen
a
case
of
this
sort
before
a
house
shut
up
and
a
master
of
hounds
in
bed
when
the
hounds
were
to
meet
before
the
door
it
could
be
the
case
the
woman
must
be
dreaming
or
drunk
or
both
but
my
good
woman
exclaimed
he
as
she
gave
a
punishing
cut
at
the
chair
as
if
to
make
up
for
lost
time
but
my
good
woman
i
wish
you
would
try
and
find
somebody
who
can
tell
me
something
about
the
hounds
i
sure
they
must
be
going
to
hunt
i
remember
you
for
your
trouble

will
added
he
again
diving
his
hand
up
to
the
wrist
in
his
pocket

replied
the
woman
slowly
and
deliberately
be
no

exclaimed
she
can
they

when
all
had
to
be
carried
to

to

had
they
exclaimed
sponge
were
they
drunk
aye
to
be
sure
what
would
you
have
them
be
replied
the
crone
who
seemed
to
think
that
drinking
was
a
necessary
concomitant
of
hunting
but
i
can
see
the
footman
or
somebody
surely
observed
sponge
fearing
that
his
chance
was
out
for
a
billet
and
recollecting
old
and
anns
and
intimations
for
him
to
start
you
ca
replied
the
dame
can
see
nebody
but
me
added
she
fixing
her
twinkling
eyes
intently
upon
him
as
she
spoke
that
a
pretty
go
observed
sponge
aloud
to
himself
ringing
his
spurs
against
his
go
or
ugly
go
snapped
the
woman
thinking
it
was
a
reflection
on
herself
all
you
get
and
thereupon
she
gave
the
back
of
the
chair
a
hearty
bastinadoing
as
if
in
exemplification
of
the
way
she
would
like
to
serve
sponge
out
for
the
observation
came
here
thinking
to
get
some
breakfast
observed
sponge
casting
an
eye
upon
the
disordered
table
and
reconnoitring
the
bottles
and
the
remains
of
the
dessert
you
said
the
woman
wish
you
may
get
it
wish
i
may
replied
he
you
would
manage
that
for
me
just
some
coffee
and
a
mutton
chop
or
two
i
remember
you
said
he
still
tantalizing
her
with
the
sound
of
the
silver
in
his
pocket
manish
it
exclaimed
the
woman
her
hopes
again
rising
at
the
sound
manish
it
how
d
think
i
to
manish
sich
things
asked
she

the
cook
or
the

many
hours

added
she

asked
he
no

zactly
that
drawled
the
woman
when
sarvants
are
kept
up
three
nights
out
of
four
they
must
make
up
for
lost
time
when
they
can
mused
sponge
is
a
bother
at
all
events
get
no
breakfast
lose
my
hunt
and
perhaps
a
billet
into
the
bargain
well
there
sixpence
for

my
good
woman
said
he
at
length
drawing
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
and
handing
her
the
contents
through
the
window
adding
make
a
beast
of
yourself
with
it
nabbut
observed
the
woman
holding
it
out
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
well
you
welcome
to
it
whatever
it
is
replied
our
friend
turning
his
horse
to
go
away
a
thought
then
struck
him
you
get
me
a
pen
and
ink
think
you
asked
he
want
to
write
a
line
to
sir
harry
and
ink
replied
the
woman
who
had
pocketed
the
groat
and
resumed
her
dusting
do
know
where
they
keep
no
such
things
as
penses
and
inkses
likely
in
the
or
the
or
perhaps
in
the
butler
pantry
observed
sponge
you
can
come
in
and
see
replied
the
woman
thinking
there
was
no
occasion
to
give
herself
any
more
trouble
for
the
our
worthy
friend
sat
on
his
horse
a
few
seconds
staring
intently
into
the
window
thinking
that
lapse
of
time
might
cause
the
to
be
sufficiently
respected
to
procure
him
something
like
directions
how
to
proceed
as
well
to
get
rid
of
his
horse
as
to
procure
access
to
the
house
the
door
of
which
stood
frowningly
shut
in
this
however
he
was
mistaken
for
no
sooner
had
the
woman
uttered
the
words
you
can
come
in
and
see
than
she
flaunted
into
the
interior
of
the
room
and
commenced
a
regular
series
of
assaults
upon
the
furniture
throwing
the
over
one
chair
back
depositing
the
in
another
rearing
the
steel
fender
up
against
the
carrara
marble
and
knocking
things
about
in
the
independent
way
that
servants
treat
unoffending
furniture
when
master
and
mistress
are
comfortably
esconced
in
bed
went
the
duster
again
went
the
furniture
this
chair
went
against
that
and
she
seemed
bent
upon
putting
all
things
into
that
happy
state
of
sixes
and
sevens
that
characterizes
a
sale
of
household
furniture
when
chairs
mount
tables
and
the
whole
system
of
domestic
economy
is
revolutionized
seeing
that
he
was
not
going
to
get
anything
more
for
his
money
our
friend
at
length
turned
his
horse
and
found
his
way
to
the
stables
by
the
unerring
drag
of
all
things
there
being
as
matters
were
in
the
house
he
put
the
redoubtable
nag
into
a
stall
and
helped
him
to
a
liberal
measure
of
oats
out
of
the
unlocked
he
then
sought
the
back
of
the
house
by
the
worn
that
connected
it
with
the
stables
the
back
yard
was
in
the
admired
confusion
that
might
be
expected
from
the
woman
account
empty
casks
and
hampers
were
piled
and
stowed
away
in
all
directions
while
regiments
of
champagne
and
other
bottles
stood
and
lay
about
among
blacking
bottles
bottles
old
brushes
and
besoms
several
pair
of
dirty
most
of
them
with
the
spurs
on
were
chucked
into
the
just
as
they
had
been
taken
off
the
kitchen
into
which
our
friend
now
entered
was
in
the
same
disorderly
state
numerous
copper
pans
stood
simmering
on
the
charcoal
stoves
and
the
jointless
jack
still
revolved
on
the
spit
a
dirty
girl
sat
sleeping
with
her
apron
thrown
over
her
head
which
rested
on
the
end
of
a
table
the
open
door
of
the
servants
hall
hard
by
disclosed
a
pile
of
dress
and
other
clothes
which
after
mopping
up
the
ale
and
other
slops
would
be
carefully
folded
and
taken
back
to
the
rooms
of
their
respective
owners

cried
sponge
shaking
the
sleeping
girl
by
the
shoulder
which
caused
her
to
start
up
stare
and
rub
her
eyes
in
wild
affright
repeated
he
happened

exclaimed
she

she
clasping
her
hands

the

other
petty
larceny

was
inquiring
about

of

he
indeed

asked
sponge
wondering
at
her
vehemence
sir
about
what

said
sobbed
the
girl
applying
the
corner
of
her
dirty
apron
to
her
eyes

the
girl
mad
rejoined
our
friend
brushing
by
and
making
for
the
passage
beyond
this
brought
him
past
the
the
room
the
housekeeper
room
and
the
butler
pantry
all
were
in
most
glorious
confusion
in
the
latter
captain

were
reposing
in
the
silver

and
captain
bouncey
varnished
pumps
were
stuffed
into
a
the
last
detachment
of
empty
bottles
stood
or
lay
about
the
floor
commingling
with
boxes
plates
lanterns
oil
bottles
corkscrews
the
usual
miscellaneous
appendages
of
a
butler
pantry
all
was
still
and
quiet
not
a
sound
save
the
loud
ticking
of
a
timepiece
or
the
occasional
creak
of
a
jarring
door
disturbed
the
solemn
silence
of
the
house
a
mugger
or
tramp
might
have
carried
off
whatever
he
liked
passing
onward
sponge
came
to
a
door
which
opening
freely
on
a
patent
spring
revealed
the
fine
proportions
of
a
light
with
which
the
bright
mahogany
doors
of
the
entertaining
rooms
communicated
opening
the
first
door
he
came
to
our
friend
found
himself
in
the
elegant
on
whose
round
table
in
the
centre
were
huddled
all
the
candles
of
the
previous
night
illumination
it
was
a
handsome
apartment
fitted
up
in
the
most
costly
style
with
brocaded
satin
damask
the
curtains
trimmed
with
silk
tassel
fringe
and
ornamented
with
massive
bullion
tassels
on
cornices
cupids
supporting
wreaths
under
an
arch
with
open
and
enrichments
in
burnished
gold
the
room
save
the
muster
of
the
candles
was
just
as
it
had
been
left
and
the
richly
gilt
sofa
still
retained
the
indentations
of
the
sitters
with
the
luxurious
down
pillows
left
as
they
had
been
supporting
their
backs
the
room
reeked
of
tobacco
and
the
ends
and
ashes
of
cigars
dotted
the
tables
and
white
marble
and
the
gilt
slabs
and
the
finely
flowered
tournay
carpet
just
as
the
fires
of
gipsies
dot
and
disfigure
the
fair
face
of
a
country
costly
china
and
of
all
sorts
were
scattered
about
in
profusion
altogether
it
was
a
beautiful
room
want
of
money
here
said
sponge
to
himself
as
he
eyed
it
and
thought
what
havoc
gustavus
james
would
make
among
the
ornaments
if
he
had
a
chance
he
then
looked
about
for
pen
ink
and
paper
these
were
distributed
so
wide
apart
as
to
show
the
little
request
they
were
in
having
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
what
he
wanted
gathered
together
sponge
sat
down
on
the
luxurious
sofa
considering
how
he
should
address
his
host
as
he
hoped
sponge
was
not
a
shy
man
but
considering
the
circumstances
under
which
he
made
sir
harry
scattercash
acquaintance
together
with
his
design
upon
his
hospitality
above
all
considering
the
crew
by
whom
sir
harry
was
surrounded
it
required
some
little
tact
to
pave
the
way
without
raising
the
present
inmates
of
the
house
against
him
there
are
no
people
so
anxious
to
protect
others
from
robbery
as
those
who
are
robbing
them
themselves
sponge
thought
and
thought
and
thought
at
last
he
resolved
to
write
on
the
subject
of
the
hounds
after
sundry
attempts
on
pink
blue
and
paper
he
at
last
succeeded
in
hitting
off
the
following
on
yellow
house
sir
harry
i
rode
over
this
morning
hearing
you
were
to
hunt
and
am
sorry
to
find
you
indisposed
i
wish
you
would
drop
me
a
line
to
crowdey
puddingpote
bower
saying
when
next
you
go
out
as
i
should
much
like
to
have
another
look
at
your
splendid
pack
before
i
leave
this
country
which
i
fear
will
have
to
be
yours
in
haste
sponge
i
hope
you
all
got
safe
home
the
other
night
from
mr
peastraw
having
put
this
into
a
richly
gilt
and
embossed
envelope
our
friend
directed
it
conspicuously
to
sir
harry
scattercash
and
stuck
it
in
the
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
he
then
retraced
his
steps
through
the
back
regions
informing
the
sleeping
beauty
he
had
before
disturbed
and
who
was
now
busy
scouring
a
pan
that
he
had
left
a
letter
in
the
for
sir
harry
and
if
she
would
see
that
he
got
it
he
sponge
would
remember
her
the
next
time
he
came
which
he
inwardly
hoped
would
be
soon
he
then
made
for
the
stable
and
got
his
horse
to
go
home
sauntering
more
leisurely
along
than
one
would
expect
of
a
man
who
had
not
got
his
breakfast
especially
one
riding
a
hack
hunter
the
truth
was
sponge
did
not
much
like
the
aspect
of
affairs
sir
harry
was
evidently
a
desperately
house
added
to
which
the
guests
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
were
clearly
of
the
order
who
could
not
spare
any
pickings
for
a
stranger
indeed
sponge
felt
that
they
rather
him
at
farmer
peastraw
and
were
in
a
greater
hurry
to
be
off
when
the
drag
came
than
the
mere
difference
between
inside
and
outside
seats
required
he
much
questioned
whether
he
got
into
sir
harry
at
all
if
it
came
to
a
vote
he
thought
he
should
not
then
what
was
he
to
do
old
jog
was
clearly
tired
of
him
and
he
had
nowhere
else
to
go
to
the
thought
made
him
stick
spurs
into
the
chestnut
and
hurry
home
to
puddingpote
bower
where
he
endeavoured
to
soothe
his
host
by
more
than
insinuating
that
he
was
going
on
a
visit
to
nonsuch
house
jog
inwardly
prayed
that
he
might
chapter
lvii
the
debate
it
was
just
as
sponge
predicted
with
regard
to
his
admission
to
nonsuch
house
the
first
person
who
spied
his
note
to
sir
harry
scattercash
was
captain
seedeybuck
who
going
into
the
the
day
after
sponge
visit
to
look
for
the
top
of
his
saw
it
occupying
the
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
having
mastered
its
contents
the
captain
refolded
and
placed
it
where
he
found
it
with
the
simple
observation
to
himself
of
cock
wo
fight
captain
quod
saw
it
next
then
captain
bouncey
who
told
captain
cutitfat
what
was
in
it
who
agreed
with
bouncey
that
it
would
do
to
have
sponge
there
indeed
it
seemed
agreed
on
all
hands
that
their
party
rather
wanted
weeding
than
increasing
thus
in
due
time
everybody
in
the
house
knew
the
contents
of
the
note
save
sir
harry
though
none
of
them
thought
it
worth
while
telling
him
of
it
on
the
third
morning
however
as
the
party
were
assembling
for
breakfast
he
came
into
the
room
reading
it
hiccup
note
ought
to
have
been
delivered
before
observed
he
holding
it
up
my
dear
replied
lady
scattercash
who
was
sitting
gloriously
fine
and
very
beautiful
at
the
head
of
the
table

sir

sir

observed
captain
bouncey
we

old
peastraw

assented
captain
cutitfat
adding
business
has
he
with
the
hounds
wants
to
know
when
we
are
going
to
hiccup
again
observed
sir
harry
he
replied
captain
seedeybuck
i
suppose
will
depend
upon
watchorn
the
party
now
got
settled
to
breakfast
and
as
soon
as
the
first
burst
of
appetite
was
appeased
the
conversation
again
turned
upon
our
friend
sponge
this
mr
sponge
asked
captain
bouncey
the
with
the
air
of
a
thorough
exclusive
nobody
answered
your
friend
asked

sir
harry
direct

replied
sir
harry
from
between
the
mouthfuls
of
a
highly
cayenned
grill
a
bolting
keeper
suggested
captain
ladofwax
who
hated
captain
bouncey
looks
more
like
a
glazier
i
think
retorted
captain
bouncey
with
a
look
of
defiance
at
the
speaker
if
he
is
one
retorted
captain
ladofwax
reddening
up
to
the
eyes
may
have
a
chance
of
repairing
somebody

the
captain
raising
his
saucer
to
discharge
it
at
his
opponent
head
with
the
cheney
exclaimed
lady
scattercash
who
was
too
much
used
to
such
scenes
to
care
about
the
belligerents
bob
spangles
caught
ladofwax
arm
at
the
nick
of
time
and
saved
the
saucer
you
hiccup
fellows
are
always
hiccup
ing
exclaimed
sir
harry
declare
i
have
you
both
hiccup
ed
over
to
keep
the
peace
they
then
broke
out
into
wordy
recrimination
and
abuse
each
declaring
that
he
would
stay
a
day
longer
in
the
house
if
the
other
remained
but
as
they
had
often
said
so
before
and
still
gave
no
symptoms
of
going
their
assertion
produced
little
effect
upon
anybody
sir
harry
would
not
have
cared
if
all
his
guests
had
gone
together
peace
and
order
being
at
length
restored
the
conversation
again
turned
upon
sponge
suppose
we
must
have
another
hiccup
hunt
soon
observed
sir
harry
course
replied
bob
spangles
no
use
keeping
the
hungry
brutes
unless
you
work
them
have
a
bagman
i
presume
observed
captain
seedeybuck
who
did
not
like
the
trouble
of
travelling
about
the
country
to
draw
for
a
fox
yes
replied
sir
harry
will
manage
all
that
he
always
hiccup
in
that
line
we
better
have
a
hunt
soon
and
then
hiccup
bugles
you
can
see
it
sir
harry
addressing
himself
to
a
gentleman
he
was
as
anxious
to
get
rid
of
as
jogglebury
crowdey
was
to
get
rid
of
mr
sponge
bugles
wo
go
out
any
more
replied
lady
scattercash
peremptorily
was
nearly
killed
last
time
her
ladyship
casting
an
angry
glance
at
her
husband
and
a
very
loving
one
on
the
object
of
her
solicitude
nought
never
in
danger
observed
bob
spangles
can
go
bob
snapped
his
sister
intend
replied
bob
hiccup
gentlemen
i
think
i
just
write
this
hiccup
to
hiccup
over
here
observed
sir
harry
then
be
ready
for
the
hiccup
hunt
whenever
we
choose
to
hiccup
one
the
proposition
fell
among
the
party
you
think
we
can
do
without
him
at
last
suggested
captain
seedeybuck
think
so
observed
the
elder
spangles
without
looking
up
from
his
plate
is
it
asked
lady
scattercash
man
that
was
here
the
other
morning
the
man
in
the
queer
boots
replied
orlando
bugles
i
think
he
rather
i
vote
we
have
him
replied
her
ladyship
that
was
rather
a
damper
for
sir
harry
but
upon
reflection
he
thought
he
could
not
be
worse
off
with
sponge
and
bugles
than
he
was
with
bugles
alone
so
having
finished
a
poor
appetiteless
breakfast
he
repaired
to
what
he
called
his
and
with
a
feeble
shaky
hand
scrawled
an
invitation
to
sponge
to
come
over
to
nonsuch
house
and
take
his
chance
of
a
run
with
his
hounds
he
then
sealed
and
posted
the
letter
without
further
to
do

four
days
had
now
elapsed
since
sponge
penned
his
overture
to
sir
harry
and
each
succeeding
day
satisfied
him
more
of
the
utter
impossibility
of
holding
on
much
longer
in
his
then
billet
at
puddingpote
bower
not
only
was
jog
coarse
and
incessant
in
his
hints
to
him
to
be
off
but
he
had
lowered
the
standard
of
entertainment
so
greatly
that
if
it
had
been
that
sponge
had
his
servant
and
horses
kept
also
he
might
as
well
have
been
living
at
his
own
expense
the
company
lights
were
all
extinguished
great
moulds
that
were
always
wanting

usurped
the
place
of
belmont
wax
napkins
were
withdrawn
introduced
marsala
did
duty
for
sherry
and
the

pudding
assumed
a
consistency
that
was
almost
incompatible
with
articulation
in
the
course
of
this
time
sponge
wrote
to
puffington
saying
if
he
was
better
he
would
return
and
finish
his
visit
but
the
wary
puff
sent
a
messenger
off
express
with
a
note
lamenting
that
he
was
ordered
to
handley
cross
for
his
health
but
man
like
hoping
that
the
pleasure
of
sponge
company
was
only
deferred
for
another
season
jawleyford
even
sponge
thought
hopeless
and
altogether
he
was
very
much
perplexed
he
had
made
a
little
money
certainly
with
his
horses
but
a
permanent
investment
of
his
elegant
person
such
as
he
had
long
been
on
the
for
seemed
as
far
off
as
ever
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
as
he
was
taking
a
solitary
stroll
about
the
country
having
about
made
up
his
mind
to
be
off
to
town
just
as
he
was
crossing
jog
buttercup
meadow
on
his
way
to
the
stable
a
rapid
bang
bang
caused
him
to
start
and
looking
over
the
hedge
he
saw
a
sportsman
in
brown
reloading
his
gun
with
a
brace
of
setters
crouching
like
statues
in
the
stubble
dead
presently
said
the
shooter
with
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
and
in
an
instant
each
dog
was
picking
up
his
bird
have
a
word
with
you
said
sponge
and
the
hedge
his
beat
causing
the
shooter
to
start
and
look
as
if
inclined
for
a
run
second
thoughts
said
sponge
was
too
near
and
he
better
brave
it
sport
asked
sponge
striding
towards
him
pretty
middling
replied
the
shooter
a
great
freckly
faced
fellow
with
whiskers
crowned
in
a
drab
rustic
pretty
middling
repeated
he
not
knowing
whether
to
act
on
the
friendly
or
defensive
day
said
sponge
eyeing
his
whiskers
and
stout
muscular
frame
is
replied
the
shooter
adding
followed
my
birds
over
the
boundary
no

said
sponge
i
dessay
be
very
glad
to
see
you

observed
the

to
a
conclusion

our

everybody
knows

very
glad
to
make
your
tendering
sponge
a
great
rough
heavy
hand
was
goin
to
call
upon
you
observed
the
stranger
as
he
ceased
swinging
sponge
arm
to
and
fro
like
a
was
goin
to
call
upon
you
to
see
if
you
come
over
to

and
have
some
shootin
at
me

exclaimed
sponge
thinking
it
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
a
day
with
the
harriers
too
if
you
like
continued
the
shooter
increasing
the
temptation
still
thought
sponge
only
bachelor
to
offer
you
but
you
not
mind
roughing
it
a
bit
observed
romford
faith
not

replied
sponge
thinking
of
the
luxuries
of
puffington
bachelor
habitation
sort
of

you
asked

excellent

the

iron

covered
with

beautiful
oats
capital
beans
splendacious

exclaimed
sponge
thinking
he
had
lit
on
his
legs
and
might
snap
his
fingers
at
jog
and
his
hints
he
take
the
high
hand
and
give
jog
up
your
man
said
sponge
in
high
glee
will
you
come
asked
romford
replied
sponge
firmly
be
it
rejoined
his
proffered
host
and
with
another
hearty
swing
of
the
arm
the
newly
made
friends
parted
charley
romford
or
facey
as
he
was
commonly
called
from
his
being
the
admitted
most
impudent
man
in
the
country
was
a
great
sort
of
fellow
who
lived
chiefly
by
his
wits
which
he
exercised
in
all
the
legitimate
lines
of
industry
poaching
betting
boxing
cards
quoits
anything
that
came
uppermost
that
he
was
a
man
of
enterprise
we
need
hardly
add
when
he
had
formed
a
scheme
for
doing
our
sponge
a
man
that
we
do
not
think
any
of
our
readers
would
trouble
themselves
to
try
a
upon
this
impudent
facey
as
if
in
contradiction
of
terms
was
originally
intended
for
a
civil
engineer
but
having
early
in
life
voted
himself
heir
to
his
uncle
gilroy
of
queercove
hill
a
great
with
a
independence
of
his
own
three
hundred
a
year
perhaps
which
a
kind
world
called
six
facey
thought
he
would
just
hang
about
until
his
uncle
was
done
with
his
shoes
and
then
be
lord
of
queercove
hill
now
oncle
gilroy
of
whom
facey
was
constantly
talking
had
a
wife
and
promising
family
in
the
sylvan
retirement
of
john
wood
whither
he
used
to
retire
after
his
business
in
was
over
so
that
facey
for
once
was
out
in
his
calculations
gilroy
however
being
as
knowing
as
nevvey
as
he
called
him
just
encouraged
facey
in
his
shooting
fishing
and
idle
propensities
generally
doubtless
finding
it
more
convenient
to
have
his
fish
and
game
for
nothing
than
to
pay
for
them
facey
having
the
apparently
inexhaustible
sum
of
a
thousand
pounds
began
life
as
a
in
a
very
small
way
to
be
sure
more
for
the
purpose
of
selling
horses
than
anything
else
but
having
succeeded
in
all
the
gentlemen
both
with
the
and
go
and
cranerfield
hounds
his
occupation
was
gone
it
requiring
an
extended
field
such
as
our
friend
sponge
roamed
to
carry
on
cheating
in
horses
for
any
length
of
time
facey
was
soon
blown
his
name
in
connexion
with
a
horse
being
enough
to
prevent
any
one
looking
at
him
indeed
we
question
that
there
is
any
less
desirable
mode
of
making
or
trying
to
make
money
than
by
cheating
or
even
dealing
in
horses
many
people
fancy
themselves
cheated
whatever
they
get
while
the
man
who
is
really
cheated
never
forgets
it
and
proclaims
it
to
the
end
of
time
moreover
no
one
can
go
on
cheating
in
horses
for
any
length
of
time
without
putting
himself
in
the
power
of
his
groom
and
let
those
who
have
seen
how
servants
lord
it
over
each
other
say
how
they
would
like
to
subject
themselves
to
similar
but
to
our
story
facey
romford
had
now
a
splendid
horse
in
nobbington
and
lord
leader
hunts
as
hobler
but
who
facey
kindly
rechristened
the
which
the
now
rising
price
of
oats
and
falling
state
of
his
finances
made
him
particularly
anxious
to
get
rid
of
ere
the
horse
performed
the
equestrian
feat
of
its
head
off
he
was
a
very
looking
horse
but
his
misfortune
consisted
in
having
such
shocking
seedy
toes
that
he
could
keep
his
shoes
on
if
he
got
through
the
first
field
with
them
on
they
were
sure
to
be
off
at
the
fence
this
horse
facey
voted
to
be
the
very
thing
for
sponge
and
hearing
that
he
had
come
into
the
country
to
hunt
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
a
capital
thing
if
he
could
get
him
to
take
mother
spare
bed
and
lodge
with
him
twelve
shillings
a
week
being
more
than
facey
liked
paying
for
his
rooms
not
that
he
paid
twelve
shillings
for
the
rooms
alone
on
the
contrary
he
had
a
stable
with
a
sort
of
kennel
for
his
pointers
and
a
sty
for
his
pig
into
the
bargain
this
pig
which

times

at

butcher
and
facey
larder
was
uncommonly
well
found
in
sausages
spare
ribs
and
the
other
component
parts
of
a

so
that
he
was
in
very
hospitable
circumstances
at
least
in
his
rough
and
ready
idea
of
what
hospitality
ought
to
be
indeed
whether
he
had
or
not
he
have
risked
it
being
quite
as
good
at
carrying
things
off
with
a
high
hand
as
sponge
himself
the
invitation
came
most
opportunely
for
worn
out
with
jealousy
and
watching
jog
had
made
up
his
mind
to
cut
to
australia
and
when
sponge
returned
after
meeting
facey
jog
was
in
the
act
of
combing
out
an
advertisement
offering
all

desirable

how
gratefully
sponge
inquiry
if
he
knew
romford
fell
on
his
ear
as
they
sat
moodily
together
after
dinner
over
some
very
port
yes

rejoined

so
that
the

stout
fellow
with
whiskers
i
going
to
stay
with
him
to
shoot
at
old
gil
where

exclaimed
jog
almost
choked
with
delight
at
the
information

repeated
he
for
the
third
time
at
puff

gasp
cough
washingforde
yes
at

ten
miles
from

here
when
d
go
replied
sponge
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
jog
was
so
rejoiced
that
he
could
hardly
sit
on
his
chair
mrs
jog
when
she
heard
it
felt
that
gustavus
james
chance
of
independence
was
gone
for
well
she
knew
that
jog
would
never
let
sponge
come
back
to
the
bower
we
need
scarcely
say
that
jog
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
most
anxious
to
forward
sponge
departure
he
offered
to
allow
bartholomew
to
convey
him
and
his
in
the
phaeton
an
offer
that
sponge
availed
himself
of
as
far
as
his
were
concerned
though
he
preferred
cantering
over
on
his
piebald
to
trailing
along
in
jog
jingling
chay
so
matters
were
arranged
and
sponge
forthwith
proceeded
to
put
his
brown
boots
his
substantial
cords
his
superfine
tights
his
cuttey
scarlet
his
dress
blue
saxony
his
clean
linen
his
heavy
spurs
and
though
last
not
least
in
importance
his
now
backless
into
his
solid
leather
portmanteau
sweeping
the
surplus
of
his
wardrobe
into
a
capacious
while
the
guest
was
thus
busy
upstairs
the
host
wandered
about
restlessly
now
stirring
up
this
person
now
hurrying
that
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
departure
his
pleasure
was
perhaps
rather
damped
by
a
running
commentary
he
overheard
through
the
of
the
stable
from
leather
as
he
stripped
his
horses
and
tried
to
roll
up
their
clothing
in
a
moderate
compass
rot
your
great
carcass
exclaimed
he
giving
the
roll
a
hearty
kick
in
its
stomach
on
finding
that
he
had
not
got
it
as
small
as
he
wanted
rot
your
great
carcass
repeated
he
scratching
his
head
and
eyeing
it
as
it
lay
is
all
the
consequence
of
your
nasty
brewers
hapron
weshins
blowin
of
one
out
like
a
bladder
and
thereupon
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
stomach
to
feel
how
his
own
was
see
sich
a
house
or
sich
an
awful
mean
man
continued
he
stooping
and
pommelling
the
package
with
his
fists
it
was
of
no
use
he
could
not
get
it
as
small
as
he
wished
have
my
jacket
out
on
you
i
do
believe
added
he
seeing
where
the
impediment
was
in
your
gizzard
just
like
a
lump
of
old
puddin
and
then
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
folds
of
the
clothing
and
pulled
out
the
greasy
garment
said
he
stooping
again
think
we
may
manish
ye
and
he
took
the
roll
in
his
arms
and
hoisted
it
on
to
hercules
whom
he
meant
to
make
the
led
horse
observing
aloud
as
he
adjusted
it
on
the
saddle
and
whacked
it
well
with
his
hands
to
make
it
lie
right
wish
it
was
old
jog
would
i
sarve
him
out
he
then
turned
his
horses
round
in
their
stalls
tucked
his
greasy
jacket
under
the
flap
of
the
took
his
from
the
crook
and
led
them
out
of
the
capacious
door
jog
looked
at
him
with
mingled
feelings
of
disgust
and
delight
leather
just
gave
his
old
hat
flipe
a
rap
with
his
forefinger
as
he
passed
with
the
horses
a
salute
that
jog
did
not
condescend
to
return
having
eyed
the
receding
horses
with
great
satisfaction
jog
the
house
by
the
kitchens
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
sponge
off
he
found
the
portmanteau
and
standing
in
the
passage
and
just
at
the
moment
the
sound
of
the
phaeton
wheels
fell
on
his
ear
as
bartholomew
drove
round
from
the
to
the
door
sponge
was
already
in
the
parlour
making
his
adieus
to
mrs
jog
and
the
children
who
were
all
assembled
for
the
purpose
are
you
goin
puff
asked
jog
with
an
air
of
surprise
replied
sponge
adding
as
he
tendered
his
hand
best
friends
must
part
you
know
puff
but
you
better
have
your
wheeze
horse
round
observed
jog
anxious
to
avoid
any
overture
for
a
return
replied
sponge
making
a
parting
bow
get
him
at
the
stable
go
with
you
said
jog
leading
the
way
leather
had
saddled
and
bridled
and
turned
him
round
in
the
stall
with
one
of
mr
jog
on
which
sponge
just
swept
over
his
tail
into
the
manger
and
led
the
horse
out
said
he
offering
his
hand
to
his
host
good
puff
sport
to
you
said
jog
shaking
it
heartily
sponge
then
mounted
his
hack
and
cocking
out
his
toe
rode
off
at
a
canter
at
the
same
moment
bartholomew
drove
away
from
the
front
door
and
jog
having
stood
watching
the
phaeton
over
the
rise
of
pennypound
hill
scraped
his
feet
his
house
and
rubbing
them
heartily
on
the
mat
as
he
closed
the
observed
aloud
to
himself
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
now
that
the
most
puff
impittent
feller
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
catch

again
chapter
lix
the
adjourned
debate
the
fatal
invitation
to
sponge
having
been
sent
the
question
that
now
occupied
the
minds
of
the
assembled
sharpers
at
nonsuch
house
was
whether
he
was
a
pigeon
or
one
of
themselves
that
point
occupied
their
very
deep
and
serious
consideration
if
he
was
a
they
could
clearly
accommodate
him
but
if
on
the
other
hand
he
was
one
of
themselves
it
was
painfully
apparent
that
there
were
far
too
many
of
them
there
already
of
course
the
subject
was
not
discussed
in
full
and
open
conclave
they
were
all
highly
honourable
men
in
the
gross
and
it
was
only
in
the
small
and
secret
groups
of
those
accustomed
to
hunt
together
and
unburden
their
minds
that
the
real
truth
was
elicited
an
ass
sir
harry
is
to
ask
this
sponge
observed
captain
quod
to
captain
seedeybuck
as
cigar
in
mouth
they
paced
backwards
and
forwards
under
the
flagged
veranda
on
the
west
side
of
the
house
on
the
morning
that
sir
harry
had
announced
his
intention
of
asking
him
ass
assented
seedeybuck
from
between
the
whiffs
of
his
cigar
it
one
would
think
he
had
more
money
than
he
knew
what
to
do
with
observed
the
first
speaker
of
not
knowing
where
to
lay
hands
on
a
halfpenny
be
here
observed
quod
with
a
shake
of
the
head
so
replied
seedeybuck
you
heard
anything
fresh
particular
the
county
court
bailiff
was
here
with
some
summonses
which
of
course
he
put
in
the
fire
that
what
he
always
does
he
got
tired
of
papering
the
with
them
replied
seedeybuck
it
a
pity
observed
quod
spitting
as
he
spoke
what
can
you
expect
eaten
up
as
he
is
by
such
a
set
of
rubbish
replied
seedeybuck
thinking
how
long
he
and
his
friend
might
have
fattened
there
together
you
know
anything
of
this
mr
sponge
asked
captain
quod
after
a
pause
replied
seedeybuck
what
we
saw
of
him
here
but
sure
he
wo
do
i
think
not
either
replied
quod
did
like
his
looks
he
seems
quite
one
of
the
sort
observed
seedeybuck
determined
to
make
a
set
against
him
instead
of
cultivating
his
acquaintance
sponge
wo
be
any
great
addition
to
our
party
i
think
muttered
captain
bouncey
to
captain
cutitfat
as
they
stood
within
the

of
the
library
window
in
apparent
contemplation
of
the
cows
but
in
reality
conning
the
sponge

captain
cutitfat
with
an
emphasis
what
made

ask
him
whispered
bouncey
adding
aloud
for
the
bystanders
to
hear

fine
cow

replied
cutitfat
in
the
same
key
adding
in
a
whisper
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
what

him
ask
half
the

distinguished
sponge
entering
the
village
or
what
the
natives
call
the
town
of
washingforde
towards
the
close
of
a
short
december
day
on

the
stud
groom

because

best
stables

replied
the
man
where

asked
sponge
seeing
there

a

lower
down
with
the
words
overend

and
to
the

a
very
meagrely
stocked
shop
devil
replied
sponge
boiling
up
as
he
eyed
the
dimensions
of
the
place
the
dialogue
was
interrupted
by
a
blow
on
sponge
back
followed
by
such
a
proffered
hand
as
could
proceed
from
none
but
his
host
to

exclaimed
facey
swinging
sponge
arm
to

continued
he
half
dragging
him
down
let

in
for
beastly
cold
and
dinner

time
so
saying
he
led
the
captive
sponge
down
street
like
a
prisoner
by
the
arm
and
opening
the
thin
pushed
him
up
a
very
straight
staircase
into
a
little
low
room
hung
with
foils
and
pictures
of
fighters
and
ballet
girls
to

continued
he
backing
sponge
across
the
staircase
landing
to
where
a
couple
of
little
black
doors
opened
into
rooms
formed
by
dividing
what
had
been
the
duplicate
of
the

two
exclaimed
facey
pointing
to

portmanteau
and

standing
midway
between

there

your
traps
yonder
the
you

below
the
the

pointing
to
a
fragment
of
glass
nailed
against
the
stencilled
wall
all
of
which
sponge
stood
eyeing
with
a
mingled
air
of
resignation
and
contempt
but
when
facey
pointed
to
chest
contrived
a
double
debt
to
pay
a
bed
by
night
a
chest
of
drawers
by
and
said
that
was
where
sponge
would
have
to
curl
himself
up
our
friend
shook
his
head
and
declared
he
could
not
fiddle
replied
facey
weatherley

in
it
for
months
and
he
half
a
hand
higher
than
you
sixteen
hands
if

an

jerked
his
head
and
bit
his
lips

saying
facey
rolled
out
of
the
room
and
sponge
presently
heard
him
pulling
off
his
clogs
of
shoes
in
the
adjoining
one
dinner
spoke
for
itself
for
the
house
reeked
with
the
smell
of
fried
onions
and
roast
pork
now
sponge
did
like
pork
and
there
was
nothing
but

black
puddings
all
very
good
in
their
way
but
which
came
with
a
bad
grace
after
the
comforts
of
jog
the
elegance
of
puffington
and
the
early
splendour
of
jawleyford
our
hero
was
a
good
deal
put
out
and
felt
as
if
he
was
imposed
upon
what
business
had
a
man
like
this
to
ask
him
to
stay
with
him
a
man
who
dined
by
daylight
and
ladled
his
meat
with
a
great
fork
facey
though
he
saw
sponge
was
pleased
praised
and
pressed
everything
in
succession
down
to
a
very
strong
cheese
and
as
the
girl
whisked
away
crumbs
and
all
in
the
coarse
tablecloth
he
exclaimed
in
a
most
air
now
what
shall
we
have
to
drink
adding
smoke
of
course
shall
it
be
gin
rum
or
hollands
hollands
rum
or
gin
sponge
was
half
inclined
to
propose
wine
but
recollecting
what
sort
of
stuff
it
was
sure
to
be
and
that
facey
in
all
probability
would
make
him
finish
it
he
just
replied
i
do
care
we
say
gin
be
it
said
facey
rising
from
his
seat
and
making
for
a
little
closet
in
the
wall
he
produced
a
bottle
labelled
london
spirit
and
hallooing
to
the
girl
to
get
a
few
out
of
the
box
under
his
bed
he
scattered
a
lot
of
glasses
about
the
table
and
placed
a
green
for
the
biscuits
against
they
came
night
had
now
closed
in
a
keen
boisterous
wintry
night
making
the
pocketful
of
coals
that
ornamented
the
grate
peculiarly
acceptable
jove
what
a
night
exclaimed
facey
as
a
blash
of
sleet
dashed
across
the
window
as
if
some
one
had
thrown
a
handful
of
pebbles
against
it
jove
what
a
night
repeated
he
rising
and
closing
the
shutters
and
letting
down
the
little
scanty
red
curtain
us
draw
in
and
have
a
hot
brew
continued
he
stirring
the
fire
under
the
kettle
and
handing
a
lot
of
cigars
out
of
the
they
then
sat
smoking
and
sipping
and
smoking
and
sipping
each
making
a
mental
estimate
of
the
other
we
have
a
game
at
cards
or
what
shall
we
do
to
pass
the
evenin
at
length
asked
our
host
have
a
game
at
cards
continued
he
no
no
i
a
book
in
my
pocket
replied
sponge
diving
into
his
adding
as
he
fished
up
his
carry
a
book
of
light
reading
about
with
me
you
a
literary
cove
are
you
asked
facey
in
a
tone
of
surprise
exactly
that
replied
sponge
i
like
to
improve
my
mind
he
then
opened
the
valuable
work
taking
a
dip
into
the
omnibus
guide
from
hyde
park
corner
european
coffee
house
near
the
bank
daily
and
so
worked
his
way
on
through
the
railway
station
brixton
bromley
both
in
kent
and
middlesex
bushey
heath
camberwell
camden
town
and
carshalton
right
into
cheam
when
facey
who
had
been
eyeing
him
intently
not
at
all
relishing
his
style
of
proceeding
and
wishing
to
be
doing
suddenly
exclaimed
as
he
darted
up
illustration
facey
romford
treats
sponge
to
a
little
music
jove
you
not
heard
me
play
the
flute
no
more
you
have
dash
it
how
remiss
continued
he
making
for
the
little
bookshelf
on
which
it
lay
adding
as
he
blew
into
it
and
sucked
the
joints
musical
of
course
i
can
stand
music
muttered
sponge
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
as
if
a
tune
was
neither
here
nor
there
with
him
jingo
you
should
see
me
oncle
gilroy
when
playin
the
old
man
sheds
tears
of
delight
he
so
pleased
replied
sponge
now
passing
on
into
cab
street
hare
court
to
or
from
bagnigge
wells
and
so
on
when
facey
struck
up
the
most
squeaking
discordant
jim
that
ever
was
heard
making
the
sensitive
sponge
shudder
and
setting
all
his
teeth
on
edge
me
but
that
flute
of
yours
wants
nitre
or
a
dose
of
physic
or
something
most
dreadful
at
length
exclaimed
he
squeezing
up
his
face
as
if
in
the
greatest
agony
as
the
laboured
about
and
wheel
completely
threw
sponge
over
in
his
calculation
as
to
what
he
could
ride
from
aldgate
pump
to
the
pied
bull
at
islington
for
no
replied
facey
with
an
air
of
indifference
as
he
took
off
the
end
and
jerked
out
the
steam
no
only
wants
work
only
wants
work
added
he
putting
it
together
again
exclaiming
as
he
looked
at
the
now
sulky
sponge
what
shall
it
be
you
please
replied
our
friend
dipping
frantically
into
his
then
i
play
you
me
oncle
favourite
tune
the
merry
swiss
boy
whereupon
facey
set
to
most
vigorously
with
that
once
most
popular
air
it
however
came
off
as
rustily
as
crow
for
whose
feats
facey
evidently
had
a
partiality
for
no
sooner
did
he
get
squeaked
through
oncle
tune
than
he
returned
to
the
nigger
melody
with
redoubled
zeal
and
puffed
and
blew
sponge
calculations
as
to
what
he
could
ride
from
redcap
at
camden
town
down
liquorpond
street
up
snow
hill
and
so
on
to
the
in
ratcliff
highway
for
clean
out
of
his
head
nor
did
there
seem
any
prospect
of
relief
for
no
sooner
did
facey
get
through
one
tune
than
he
at
the
other
again
it
at
length
exclaimed
sponge
throwing
his
from
him
in
despair
deafen
me
with
that
abominable
noise
my
heart
exclaimed
facey
in
surprise
my
heart
why
i
thought
you
liked
music
my
dear
feller
adding
was
playin
to
please
you
deuce
you
were
snapped
sponge
wish
i
known
sooner
have
saved
you
a
deal
of
wind
my
dear
feller
replied
facey
wished
to
entertain
you
the
best
in
my
power
one
must
do
somethin
you
know
rather
do
anything
than
undergo
that
horrid
noise
replied
sponge
ringing
his
left
ear
with
his
forefinger
have
a
game
at
cards
then
rejoined
facey
soothingly
seeing
he
had
sufficiently
agonized
sponge
replied
sponge
repeated
he
thoughtfully
stroking
his
hairy
chin
added
he
for
the
third
time
as
he
conned
rotund
visage
and
wondered
if
he
was
a
sharper
if
the
cards
were
fair
sponge
did
care
trying
his
luck
it
all
depended
upon
that
said
he
in
a
tone
of
indifference
as
he
picked
up
his
thinking
he
would
pay
if
he
lost
give
you
a
turn
what
shall
it
be
we
say
replied
facey
in
an
sort
of
way
drawled
sponge
pocketing
his
preparatory
to
action
have
a
clean
pack
have
you
asked
sponge
as
facey
diving
into
a
drawer
produced
a
very
dirty
set
no
i
have
replied
facey
no
i
have
but
honour
bright
these
are
all
right
and
fair
would
cheat
a
man
if
it
was
ever
so
you
would
replied
sponge
nothing
comforted
by
the
assertion
they
then
resumed
their
seats
opposite
each
other
at
the
little
table
with
the
hot
water
and
sugar
and
london
spirit
bottle
equitably
placed
between
them
at
first
sponge
was
the
victor
and
by
nine
had
scored
shillings
against
his
host
when
he
was
inclined
to
leave
off
alleging
that
he
was
an
early
man
and
would
go
to
bed
an
arrangement
that
facey
seemed
to
come
into
only
pressing
sponge
to
accompany
the
gin
he
was
now
helping
himself
to
with
another
cigar
this
seemed
all
fair
and
reasonable
and
as
sponge
conned
matters
over
through
the
benign
influence
of
the
he
really
thought
facey
might
be
such
a
bad
beggar
after
all
then
said
he
as
he
finished
cigar
and
glass
together
give
me
bob
i
be
off
to
bedfordshire
give
me
my
revenge
surely
exclaimed
facey
in
pretended
astonishment
night
replied
sponge
firmly
thinking
it
would
have
to
go
hard
with
him
if
he
remained
there
to
give
it
rejoined
facey
adding
quite
early
me
oncle
gilroy
and
i
always
play
much
later
at
queercove
hill
sponge
hesitated
if
he
had
got
the
money
he
would
have
refused
as
it
was
he
thought
perhaps
the
only
chance
of
getting
it
was
to
go
on
with
no
small
reluctance
and
misgivings
he
mixed
himself
another
tumbler
of
gin
and
water
and
changing
seats
resumed
the
game
nor
was
our
discreet
friend
far
wrong
in
his
calculations
for
luck
now
changed
and
facey
seemed
to
have
the
king
quite
at
command
in
less
than
an
hour
he
had
not
only
wiped
off
the
shillings
but
had
scored
three
pound
fifteen
against
his
guest
facey
would
now
leave
off
sponge
on
the
other
hand
wanted
to
go
on
facey
however
was
firm
cut
you
double
or
quits
then
cried
sponge
in
rash
despair
facey
accommodated
him
and
doubled
the
debt
exclaimed
sponge
with
desperate
energy
no
more
thank
ye
replied
facey
coolly
play
a
jewel
it
is
assented
sponge
thinking
he
had
had
it
continued
facey
poking
into
the
and
producing
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
with
a
little
pocket
you
give
me
an
we
shut
up
shop
retorted
sponge
looking
virtuously
indignant
i
give
you
your
money
i
the
mornin
know
you
will
replied
facey
coolly
putting
himself
in
boxing
attitude
exclaiming
as
he
measured
out
a
distance
feel
the
biceps
muscle
of
my
arm
do
believe
i
could
fell
an
ox
however
never
mind
continued
he
seeing
sponge
declined
the
feel
uncertain
so
you
give
me
an
and
we
be
all
right
and
square
short
make
long
friends
you
know
added
he
pointing
peremptorily
to
the
paper
better
give
you
a
cheque
at
once
retorted
sponge
looking
the
very
essence
of
chivalry
if
you
please
replied
facey
muttering
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
like
paper
the
renowned
sponge
for
once
was
posed
he
had
the
money
but
he
like
to
part
with
it
so
he
gave
the
and
lighting
a
candle
sulked
off
to
undress
and
crawl
into
the
little
impossibility
of
a
bed
night
however
brought
no
relief
to
our
distinguished
friend
for
little
though
the
bed
was
it
was
large
enough
to
admit
lodgers
and
poor
sponge
was
nearly
worried
by
the
vermin
who
seemed
bent
on
making
up
for
the
long
fast
they
had
endured
since
the
left
worst
of
all
as
day
dawned
the
eternal
crow
recommenced
his
saltations
varied
only
with
the
arouse
ye
arouse
ye
my
merry
swiss
of
oncle
gilroy
dash
my
buttons
groaned
sponge
as
the
discordant
noise
shot
through
his
aching
head
this
is
the
worst
spec
i
ever
made
in
my
life
fed
on
pork
fluted
deaf
bit
with
bugs
and
robbed
at
cards
fairly
downrightly
robbed
never
was
a
more
plant
put
on
a
man
thank
goodness
however
i
have
paid
him
never
will
either
such
a
confounded
disreputable
scoundrel
deserves
to
be
punished
big
bad
fellow
how
the
deuce
i
could
ever
be
taken
in
by
such
a
fellow
believe
he
nothing
but
a
great
poaching
blackleg
has
the
faintest
outlines
of
a
gentleman
about
him
not
the
slightest
particle
not
the
remotest
glimmerin
these
and
similar
reflections
were
interrupted
by
a
great
thump
against
the
thin
wall
that
separated
their
rooms
or
rather
closets
accompanied
by
an
exclamation
of
old
boy
how
goes
it
an
inquiry
to
which
our
friend
deigned
no
answer
rot
ye
you
awake
muttered
facey
to
himself
well
knowing
that
no
one
could
sleep
after
such
a
and
as
he
had
given
him
he
therefore
resumed
his
battery
thumping
as
though
he
would
knock
the
partition
in
at
last
exclaimed
sponge
there
old
how
goes
it
asked
facey
in
a
tone
of
the
keenest
irony
be
growled
sponge
in
disgust
in
half
an
hour
resumed
facey
and
sarsingers
all
pipin
continued
our
host
you
were
pipin
growled
sponge
as
he
jerked
himself
out
of
his
little
berth
though
facey
pumped
him
pretty
hard
during
this
second
pig
repast
he
could
make
nothing
out
of
sponge
with
regard
to
his
movements
our
friend
parrying
all
his
inquiries
with
his
and
assurances
that
he
could
amuse
himself
in
vain
facey
represented
that
his
oncle
gilroy
would
be
expecting
them
that
hobler
was
ready
for
him
to
ride
over
on
sponge
was
inclined
to
shoot
but
begged
facey
would
stay
at
home
on
his
account
the
fact
was
sponge
meditated
a
bolt
and
was
in
close
confab
with
leather
in
the
rose
and
crown
stables
arranging
matters
when
the
sound
of
his
name
in
the
yard
caused
him
to
look
out
when
oh
welcome
sight
a
puddingpote
bower
messenger
put
sir
harry
note
in
his
hand
which
had
at
length
arrived
at
jog
through
their
very
miscellaneous
transit
called
a
post
sponge
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
actually
gave
the
lad
a
shilling
he
now
felt
like
a
new
man
he
did
care
a
rap
for
facey
and
ordering
leather
to
give
him
the
hack
and
follow
with
the
hunters
he
presently
cantered
out
of
town
as
sprucely
as
if
all
was
on
the
square
when
however
facey
found
how
matters
stood
he
determined
to
stop
sponge
things
which
leather
resisted
and
facey
showing
fight
leather
butted
him
with
his
head
sending
him
backwards
downstairs
and
putting
his
shoulder
out
leather
than
marched
off
with
the
kit

my

the
gallant

resolved
themselves
into
a
committee
of
speculation
as
to
whether

was
coming
or
not
indeed
they
had
been
betting
upon
it
the
odds
at
first
being
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
came
though
they
had

the

somewhere
observed

adding
to
the
footman
better

piloting

up
to
her

said
he
in

low
and
deferential
a
tone
as
if

got
his

her

and
so
on
whereupon
miss
glitters
curtsied
the
gentlemen
bobbed
their
heads
and
drew
near
our
hero
who
had
now
stationed
himself
before
the
fire
said
he
stooping
and
placing
both
hands
to
the
bars
repeated
he
rubbing
his
hands
and
looking
around
illustration
generally
is
about
this
time
of
year
i
think
observed
miss
glitters
who
was
quite
ready
to
enter
for
our
friend
it
wo
stop
hunting
said
sponge
not
replied
sir
harry
be
a
bore
if
it
did
wonder
you
gentlemen
do
prefer
hunting
in
a
frost
observed
miss
howard
would
think
it
would
be
just
the
time
you
want
a
good
warming
do
agree
with
you
there
replied
sponge
looking
at
her
and
thinking
she
was
not
nearly
so
pretty
as
miss
glitters
you
hunt
asked
he
of
sir
harry
not
having
been
able
to
obtain
any
information
at
the
stables
hiccup
oh
i
dare
say
we
shall
replied
sir
harry
who
kept
his
hounds
as
he
did
his
carriages
to
be
used
when
wanted
say
we
shall
repeated
he
but
though
sir
harry
spoke
thus
encouragingly
of
their
prospects
he
took
no
steps
as
far
as
sponge
could
learn
to
carry
out
the
design
indeed
the
subject
of
hunting
was
never
once
mentioned
the
conversation
after
dinner
instead
of
being
about
the
quorn
or
the
pytchley
or
jack
thompson
with
the
atherstone
turning
upon
the
elegance
and
lighting
of
the
casinos
in
the
adelaide
gallery
and
windmill
street
and
the
relative
merits
of
those
establishments
over
the
casino
de
venise
in
high
holborn
nor
did
morning
produce
any
change
for
the
better
for
sir
harry
and
all
the
captains
came
down
in
their
usual
flashy
attire
their
whole
thoughts
being
absorbed
in
arranging
for
a
pool
at
billiards
in
which
the
ladies
took
part
so
with
billiards
brandy
and
brandy
and
billiards
varied
with
an
occasional
stroll
about
the
grounds
the
inmates
of
nonsuch
house
beguiled
the
time
much
to
sponge

whose
soul
was
on
fire
and
eager
for
the
fray
the

perhaps
being
the
same
we
will
skip
christmas
and
pass
on
to
new
year
day
chapter
lxii
a
family
breakfast
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
new
year
day
is
always
a
great
holiday
it
is
a
day
on
which
custom
commands
people
to
be
happy
and
idle
whether
they
have
the
means
of
being
happy
and
idle
or
not
it
is
a
day
for
which
happiness
and
idleness
are
and
parties
are
planned
and
arranged
long
beforehand
some
go
to
the
town
some
to
the
country
some
take
rail
some
take
steam
some
take
greyhounds
some
take
gigs
while
others
take
guns
and
pop
at
all
the
little
that
come
in
their
way
the
rural
population
generally
incline
to
a
hunt
they
are
not
very
particular
as
to
style
so
long
as
there
are
a
certain
number
of
hounds
and
some
men
in
scarlet
to
blow
their
horns
halloo
and
crack
their
whips
the
population
especially
the
rising
population
about
nonsuch
house
all
inclined
that
way
a
new
year
day
hunt
with
sir
harry
had
long
been
looked
forward
to
by
the
little
raws
and
the
little
spooneys
and
the
big
and
little
cheeks
and
we
do
know
how
many
others
nay
it
had
been
talked
of
by
the
elder
boys
at
their
respective
schools
we
beg
pardon
academies
switchington
latherington
skelper
and
a
liberal
allowance
of
boasting
indulged
in
as
to
how
they
would
show
each
other
the
way
over
the
hedges
and
ditches
the
thing
had
long
been
talked
of
old
johnny
raw
had
asked
sir
harry
to
arrange
the
day
so
long
ago
that
sir
harry
had
forgotten
all
about
it
sir
harry
was
one
of
those
souls
who
ca
say
to
any
one
if
anybody
had
asked
if
they
might
set
fire
to
his
house
he
would
have
said
hiccup
certainly
my
dear
hiccup
fellow
if
it
will
give
you
any
hiccup
pleasure
now
for
the
hiccup
day
it
is
generally
a
frost
on
new
year
day
however
wet
and
sloppy
the
weather
may
be
up
to
the
end
of
the
year
it
generally
turns
over
a
new
leaf
on
that
day
new
year
day
is
generally
a
bright
bitter
sunshiny
day
with
starry
ice
and
a
most
decided
feeling
about
it
light
airy
ringy
anything
but
cheery
for
hunting
thus
it
was
in
sir
harry
scattercash
county
having
smoked
and
drunk
the
old
year
out
the
captains
and
company
retired
to
their
couches
without
thinking
about
hunting
sponge
indeed
was
about
tired
of
asking
when
the
hounds
would
be
going
out
it
was
otherwise
however
with
the
rising
generation
who
were
up
betimes
and
began
pouring
in
upon
nonsuch
house
in
every
species
of
garb
on
every
description
of
steed
by
every
line
and
avenue
of
approach
what

now
exclaimed
lady

as
she
caught

she
in

undertone
as

in

long
way
through

since

his
two
hind

growled
george
amidst
the
mirth
of
his
comrades
makin
a
fool
o
one
but
what
must
i
do
with
all
these
little
hiccup
creatures
asked
sir
harry
again
seeing
the
plot
still
thickening
outside
them
out
a
bagman
suggested
sponge
in
an
undertone
adding
has
a
i
know
in
the
watchorn
would
hiccup
on
such
a
day
as
this
replied
sir
harry
year
day
too
most
likely
away
seeing
his
young
hounds
at
walk
might
see
at
all
events
observed
sponge
assented
sir
harry
ringing
the
bell
said
he
as
the
servant
answered
the
summons
wish
you
would
hiccup
to
watchorn
and
ask
if
he
have
the
kindness
to
hiccup
down
here
sir
harry
was
obliged
to
be
polite
for
watchorn
too
was
on
the
list
as
miss
glitters
called
it
sir
harry
replied
peter
leaving
the
room
presently
peter
white
legs
were
seen
wending
their
way
among
the
laurels
and
evergreens
in
the
direction
of
watchorn
house
he
having
a
house
and
grass
for
six
cows
all
whose
milk
he
declared
went
to
the
puppies
and
young
hounds
luckily
or
unluckily
perhaps
watchorn
was
at
home
and
was
in
the
act
of
shaving
as
peter
entered
he
was
a
fellow
who
cultivated
his
face
on
the
system
of
husbandry
first
he
had
a
bare
fallow
we
mean
a
clean
shave
that
of
course
was
followed
by
a
full
crop
of
hair
all
over
except
on
his
upper
lip
then
he
had
a
soldier
shave
off
by
the
ear
which
in
turn
was
followed
by
a
newgate
frill
the
latter
was
his
present
style
he
had
now
no
whiskers
but
an
immense
protuberance
of
bristly
black
hair
rising
like
a
wave
above
his
kerchief
though
he
cared
no
more
about
hunting
than
his
master
he
was
very
fond
of
his
red
coat
which
he
wore
on
all
occasions
substituting
a
hat
for
a
cap
when
duty
as
he
called
it
having
attired
himself
in
his
best
scarlet
of
which
he
claimed
three
a
year
one
for
wet
days
one
for
dry
days
another
for
high
days
very
natty
kerseymere
shorts
and
gaiters
with
a
toilenette
waistcoat
he
proceeded
to
obey
the
summons
said
sir
harry
as
the
important
gentleman
appeared
at
the
door
these
young
hiccup
gentlemen
want
a
hiccup
hunt
want
must
be
their
master
sir
replied
watchorn
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
flushed
face
for
he
had
been
drinking
all
night
and
was
half
drunk
then
you
manage
it
asked
sir
harry
mildly
possible
sir
asked
the
huntsman
possible
no
man
fonder
of
than
i
am
but
to
turn
out
on
sich
a
day
as
this
would
be
a
daring
a
desperate
violation
of
all
the
laws
of
registered
propriety
the
pope
bull
would
be
nothin
to
it
so
asked
sir
harry
puzzled
with
the
jumble
so
repeated
watchorn
so
why
in
the
fust
place
it
a
mortal
frost
nor
hiron
in
the
second
place
i
got
no
arrangements
made
you
ca
turn
out
a
pack
of
as
you
would
a
lot
of
staggers
or
muggers
and
in
the
third
place
you
knock
all
your
nags
to
bits
and
they
are
a
deal
better
in
their
wind
than
they
are
on
their
legs
as
it
is
no
sir
no
continued
he
slowly
and
thoughtfully
sir
no
be
cardinal
wiseman
for
once
sir
be
cardinal
wiseman
for
once
and
do
of
it
replied
sir
harry
looking
at
george
cheek
suppose
there
no
help
for
it
was
quite
a
thaw
where
i
came
from
observed
cheek
half
to
sir
harry
and
half
to
the
huntsman
sir
replied
watchorn
with
a
chuck
of
his
fringed
chin
generally
is
a
thaw
everywhere
but
where
hounds
meet
uncle
jollyboy
would
be
stopped
by
such
a
frost
as
this
observed
cheek
sir
replied
watchorn
uncle
jellyboy
a
very
fine
feller
i
dare
say
very
fine
feller
no
such
conjurers
in
these
parts
as
he
is
what
man
dare
i
dare
he
who
dares
more
is
no
man
added
watchorn
giving
his
fat
thigh
a
hearty
slap
done
old
talliho
exclaimed
miss
glitters
have
you
on
the
stage
next
will
you
wet
your
whistle
with
after
your
fine
speech
asked
lady
scattercash
a
tumbler
of
chumpine
if
there
is
any
replied
watchorn
looking
about
for
a
bottle
you
come
on
badly
observed
captain
seedeybuck
holding
up
an
empty
one
bouncey
and
i
have
just
finished
the
last
the
captain
chucking
the
bottle
sideways
on
to
the
floor
and
rolling
it
towards
its
companion
in
the
corner
a
fresh
bottle
suggested
lady
scattercash
drawing
the

her
chair
said
her

as
the
footman
answered
the
summons
on
exclaimed
captain
bouncey
shouted
sir
harry
have
a
regular
observed
miss
howard
who
was
fond
of

replied
bouncey

observed
presently
fiz

fiz

went
the
bottles
and
as
the
hissing
beverage
foamed
over
the
glasses
were
sought
and
held
out
to
catch
the
creaming
contents
a
hiccup
happy
new
year
to
us
all
exclaimed
sir
harry
drinking
off
his
wine
exclaimed
the
company
in
irregular
order
as
they
drank
off
theirs
drink
watchorn
and
the
nonsuch
hounds
exclaimed
bob
spangles
as
watchorn
having
drained
off
his
tumbler
replaced
it
on
the
sideboard
all
the
honours
exclaimed
captain
cutitfat
filling
his
glass
and
rising
to
give
the
time
your
good
health
your
good
health
sounded
from
all
parts
which
watchorn
kept
acknowledging
and
looking
about
for
the
means
to
return
the
compliment
his
friends
being
more
intent
upon
drinking
his
health
than
upon
supplying
him
with
wine
at
last
he
caught
the
third
of
a
bottle
of
and
emptying
it
into
his
tumbler
held
it
up
while
he
thus
addressed
them
all
said
he
thank
you
most
for
this
mark
of
your
applause
it
most
gratifying
to
my
feelins
to
be
thus
remembered
applause
i
could
say
a
great
deal
more
but
the
liquor
wait
so
saying
he
drained
off
his
glass
while
the
wine
effervesced
and
what
d
hiccup
of
the
weather
now
asked
sir
harry
as
his
huntsman
again
deposited
his
tumbler
on
the
sideboard
my
soul
sir
replied
watchorn
quite
briskly
really
think
we
we
might
try
at
all
events
the
day
seems
changed
added
he
staring
vacantly
out
of
the
window
on
the
bright
sunny
landscape
with
the
leafless
trees
dancing
before
his
eyes
think
so
said
sir
harry
do
you
think
mr
sponge
added
he
appealing
to
our
hero
an
hour
may
make
a
great
difference
observed
sponge
sun
will
then
be
at
its
best
try
at
all
events
observed
sir
harry
right
exclaimed
george
cheek
waving
a
scarlet
bandana
over
his
head
shall
expect
you
to
ride
up
to
the
young
gent
observed
watchorn
darting
an
angry
look
at
the
speaker
i
old
boy
exclaimed
george
over
you
if
you
do
get
out
of
the
way
sneered
the
huntsman
whisking
about
to
leave
the
room
muttering
as
he
passed
behind
the
large
indian
screen
at
the
door
something
about
jackanapes
well
called
cheek
in
an
hour
exclaimed
watchorn
from
the
steps
of
the
front
door
an
announcement
that
was
received
by
the
little
raws
and
little
spooneys
and
little
baskets
and
little
bulgeys
and
little
bricks
and
little
others
with
rapturous
applause
all
was
now
commotion
and
inside
and
out
glasses
were
drained
lips
wiped
and
napkins
thrown
hastily
away
while
ladies
and
gentlemen
began
grouping
and
talking
about
hats
and
habits
and
what
they
should
ride
go
with
me
orlando
said
lady
scattercash
to
our

asked
captain
seedeybuck
examining
the
skirts
of
a
much
frayed
surtout
coat
replied
captain
quod
can
lend
you
a
joinville
if
that
will
do
as
well
the
captain
feeling
his
own
extensive
one
as
he
spoke
said
seedeybuck
turning
about
to
ask
sir
harry
you
are
going
to
give
watchorn
a
tussle
are
you
asked
captain
cutitfat
of
george
cheek
as
the
latter
began
adjusting
the
riband
about
his
hat
believe
you
replied
george
with
a
knowing
jerk
of
his
head
adding
wo
take
much
to
beat
him
he
a
slow
is
he
asked
cutitfat
in
an
undertone
coach
i
ever
saw
growled
george
ride
wo
he
asked
the
captain
if
he
can
help
it
replied
george
adding
he
such
a
shocking
huntsman
never
saw
such
a
huntsman
in
all
my
life
george
experience
lay
between
his
uncle
jellyboy
who
rode
eighteen
stone
and
a
half
tom
scramble
the
pedestrian
huntsman
of
the
slowfoot
hounds
near
latherington
and
watchorn
but
critics
especially
hunting
ones
are
all
ready
made
as
lord
byron
said
we
better
disperse
and
get
ready
observed
bob
spangles
making
for
the
door
whereupon
the
tide
of
population
flowed
that
way
and
the
room
was
presently
cleared
george
cheek
and
the
juveniles
then
returned
to
their
friends
in
the
front
and
george
got
up
pony
races
among
the
johnny
raws
the
baskets
the
bulgeys
and
the
spooneys
thrice
round
the
carriage
ring
and
a
distance
to
the
detriment
of
the
gravel
and
the
discomfiture
of
the
in
the
centre
chapter
lxiv
the
kennel
and
the
stud
we
will
now
accompany
watchorn
to
the
stable
whither
his
resolute
legs
carried
him
as
soon
as
the
champagne
wrought
the
wonderful
change
in
his
opinion
of
the
weather
though
as
he
every
now
and
then
crossed
a
spangled
piece
of
ground
upon
which
the
sun
had
not
struck
or
stopped
to
crack
a
piece
of
ice
with
his
toe
he
shook
his
heated
head
and
doubted
whether
was
cardinal
wiseman
for
making
the
attempt
nothing
but
the
fact
of
his
considering
it
perfectly
immaterial
whether
he
was
with
his
hounds
or
not
encouraged
him
in
the
undertaking
them
said
he
must
just
take
care
of
themselves
with
which
laudable
resolution
and
an
inward
anathema
at
george
cheek
he
left
off
trying
the
ground
and
tapping
the
ice
watchorn
hurried
excited
appearance
produced
little
satisfaction
among
the
grooms
and
helpers
at
the
stables
who
were
congratulating
themselves
on
the
opportune
arrival
of
the
frost
and
arranging
how
they
should
spend
their
new
year
day
sharp
lads
look
sharp
exclaimed
he
clapping
his
hands
as
he
ran
up
the
yard
sharp
lads
look
sharp
repeated
he
as
the
astonished
helpers
showed
their
bare
arms
and
dirty
shirts
at
the
partially
opened
doors
responsive
to
the
sound
snaffle
here
send
brown
here
send
green
here
send
snooks
here
exclaimed
he
with
the
air
of
a
man
in
authority
now
snaffle
was
the
a
personage
altogether
independent
of
the
huntsman
and
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
snaffle
had
just
as
much
right
to
send
for
watchorn
as
watchorn
had
to
send
for
him
but
watchorn
being
as
we
said
before
some
way
connected
with
lady
scattercash
he
just
did
as
he
liked
among
the
whole
of
them
and
they
were
too
good
judges
to
rebel
said
he
as
the
portly
personage
waddled
up
to
him
said
he
many
sound
have
you
sir
replied
snaffle
confidently
many
have
you
that
can
go
then
a
good
many
replied
snaffle
raising
his
hands
to
tell
them
off
on
his
fingers
and
hannah
bell
hannibal
and
ugly
jade
and
the
baronet
as
we
calls
him
and
harkaway
and
and
and
and
groggytoes
and
greedyboy
and
that
to
say
and
at
least
observed
snaffle
qualifying
his
original
assertion
well
said
watchorn
do
two
legs
are
too
many
for
some
of
the
rips
they
have
to
carry
let
me
see
continued
he
thoughtfully
ride
sir
said
snaffle
you
put
him
on
asked
snaffle
replied
watchorn
i
wants
to
save
the
i
wants
to

the

sir
must
ride
her

going
asked
snaffle

replied
watchorn
you

addressing
a
helper
traces
to
turn
her
out
a
pony
phaeton
and
pair
with
fresh
rosettes
and
all
complete
you
know
sir
said
snooks
with
a
touch
of
his
forelock
you
better
tell
leather
to
have
a
horse
for
his
master
observed
watchorn
to
snaffle
as
how
you
wish
to
put
him
on
one
of
yours
i
exclaimed
snaffle
enough
to
mount
without
him
d
know
how
many
be
goin
asked
he
replied
watchorn
hurrying
off
adding
as
he
went
hang
just
saddle
all
and
let
scramble
for
the
scene
then
changed
instead
of
hissing
helpers
pursuing
their
vocations
in
stable
or
they
began
bustling
about
with
saddles
on
their
heads
and
bridles
in
their
hands
the
day
of
expected
ease
being
changed
into
one
of
unusual
trouble
leather
declared
as
he
swept
the
clothes
over
tail
that
it
was
the
most
unconscionable
proceeding
he
had
ever
witnessed
and
muttered
something
about
the
quiet
comforts
he
had
left
at
jogglebury
crowdey
hinting
his
regret
at
having
come
to
sir
harry
in
a
sort
of
dialogue
with
himself
as
he
saddled
the
horse
the
beauties
of
the
last
place
always
come
out
strong
when
a
servant
gets
to
another
but
we
must
accompany
watchorn
though
his
early
career
with
the
camberwell
and
balham
hill
union
harriers
had
not
initiated
him
much
into
the
delicacies
of
the
chase
yet
recollecting
the
presence
of
sponge
he
felt
suddenly
seized
with
a
desire
of
things
as
they
should
be
and
he
went
muttering
to
the
kennel
thinking
how
he
would
leave
dinnerbell
and
prosperous
at
home
and
how
the
pack
would
look
quite
as
well
without
frantic
running
half
a
field
ahead
or
old
stormer
and
stunner
bringing
up
the
rear
with
long
protracted
howls
he
doubted
indeed
whether
he
would
take
desperate
who
was
an
incorrigible
skirter
but
as
she
was
not
much
worse
in
this
respect
than
chatterer
or
harmony
who
was
also
an
inveterate
babbler
and
the
pack
would
look
rather
short
without
them
he
reserved
the
point
for
further
consideration
as
the
judges
say
his
speculations
were
interrupted
by
arriving
at
the
kennel
and
finding
the
door
fast
he
looked
under
the
slate
and
above
the
frame
and
inside
the
window
and
on
the
wall
for
the
key
and
his
shake
and
kick
and
clatter
were
only
answered
by
a
full
chorus
from
the
excited
company
within
the
feller
what
got
exclaimed
he
meaning
joe
haggish
the
feeder
whom
he
expected
to
find
there
joe
however
was
absent
not
but
on
a
diplomatic
visit
to
greystones
the
miller
at
splashford
who
had
positively
refused
to
supply
any
more
meal
until
his
bill
for
the
three
previous
years
was
settled
and
flesh
being
very
scarce
in
the
country
the
hounds
were
quite
light
and
fit
to
go
joe
had
gone
to
try
and
coax
greystones
out
of
a
ton
or
two
of
meal
on
the
strength
of
its
being
new
year
day
the
feller
wot
exclaimed
watchorn
seizing
the
latch
and
rattling
it
furiously
the
melody
of
the
hungry
pack
increased
rot
the
door
exclaimed
the
infuriated
huntsman
setting
his
back
against
it
at
the
first
push
open
it
flew
watchorn
fell
back
and
the
astonished
pack
poured
over
his
prostrate
body
regardless
alike
of
his
holiday
coat
his
tidy
tie
and
toilenette
vest
what
a
scrimmage
what
a
was
there
away
the
hounds
scampered
towling
and
howling
some
up
to
the
fleshwheel
to

reversing

watchorn
was
too

she
met
her

in
the

with
the

deposited
himself

a
roomy
house

been
the

there
was
anything
to

to

on

with

buckled
on

hurried
off

to

came

where

the
frosty

then
resounded
with
the
twang
twang
twang
of
his
horn
and

began
drawing
up
from
all
quarters
just
as
sportsmen
cast
up
at
a
meet
from
no
one
knows
where

he
coaxing
and
making
much
of
the
galloper
old
boy
continued
he
diving
into
his
and
throwing
him
a
bit
of
biscuit
the
appearance
of
food
had
a
very
encouraging
effect
for
forthwith
there
was
a
general
rush
towards
watchorn
and
it
was
only
by
rating
and
swinging
his
about
that
he
prevented
the
pack
from
pawing
and
perhaps
downing
him
at
length
having
got
them
somewhat
tranquillized
he
set
off
on
his
return
to
the
stables
coaxing
the
shy
hounds
and
rating
and
rapping
those
that
seemed
inclined
to
break
away
thus
he
managed
to
march
into
the
in
pretty
good
order
just
as
the
house

arrived
in
the
opposite
direction
attired
in
the
most
extraordinary
and
incongruous

drab
little

baggy
scarlet
whose
gaping
showed
that
they
had
carried
its
late
owner
hands
as
well
as
his

the
clumsy
device
on
the
tarnished

looking
quite
as
much
like
as

tight
tweed

in
a
venerable

of
the

made
in
the
popular
reign
of

whose
and
smeared
silk
facings
bore
testimony
to
the
good
cheer
it
had
seen
as

in

on
a

large

on

of

a
pair
of
old

of
his

into
long
with

giving
the
whole
a

unique

novel
appearance

going

it

came
hitching

limping
along

working

as

captain

seized
her
pretty
little
uplifted

and
vaulted
her
into
the
saddle
as
light
as
a
cork
taking
the
horse
gently
by
the
mouth
she
gave
him
the
slightest
possible
touch
with
the

and
moved
him
about
at
will
instead
of
fretting
and
fighting
him
as
the
clumsy
bugles
had
done
she
looked
beautiful
on
horseback
and
for
a
time
riveted
the
attention
of
our
sportsmen
at
length
they
began
to
think
of
themselves
and
then
there
were
such
climbings
on
and
clutchings
and
catchings
and
clingings
and
and
and
and
questionings
if

the

the
hunt
while
the
foregoing
arrangements
were
in
progress
watchorn
had
desired
slarkey
the
to
go
into
the
old
and
take
the
fox
he
would
find
and
put
him
down
among
the
laurels
by
the
where
he
would
draw
up
to
him
all
like
accordingly
slarkey
went
but
the
old
cripple
having
mounted
the
rafters
slarkey
did
see
him
or
rather
seeing
but
one
fox
he
clutched
him
with
a
greater
regard
to
his
not
biting
him
than
to
seeing
how
many
legs
he
had
consequently
he
bagged
an
uncommonly
fine
old
dog
fox
that
wiley
tom
had
just
stolen
from
lord
scamperdale
new
cover
at
faggotfurze
and
it
was
not
until
slarkey
put
him
down
among
the
bushes
and
saw
how
lively
he
went
that
he
found
out
his
mistake
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
he
had
just
time
to
pocket
the
bag
when
watchorn
cheer
and
the
reverberating
cracks
of
ponderous
whips
on
either
side
of
the
dean
announced
the
approach
of
the
pack
in
there
cried
watchorn
to
the
hounds

slippy
said
he
to
himself
at
him

exclaimed
he
as
his

slid
a
long
slide
in
conqueror

continued
he
exclaiming
loud
enough
for

who
was
drawing
near
to
hear
us

fox
that

five
and
forty

watchorn
not
exactly
knowing
what
the
term
of
the
globes
meant
d
call
that
exclaimed
he
taking
off
his
cap
as
he
viewed
the
fox
stealing
along
the
gravel
walk
adding
to
himself
as
he
saw
his
even
action
and
full
brush
rot
him
got
hold
of
the
wrong
it
was
however
no
time
for
thought
in
an
instant
the
welkin
rang
with
the
outburst
of
the
pack
and
the
clamour
of
the
field
ho
ho
ho
cried
a
score
of
voices
and
twang
twang
went
the
shrill
horn
of
the
huntsman
the
whips
too
stood
in
their
stirrups
cracking
their
ponderous
thongs
which
sounded
like
guns
upon
the
frosty
air
and
contributed
their
together
get
together
hounds
away
away
away
to
the
general
uproar
oh
what
a
row
what
a
riot
what
a
racket
watchorn
being
for
it
and
recollecting
how
many
saw
a
start
who
never
thought
of
seeing
a
finish
immediately
got
his
horse
by
the
head
and
singled
himself
out
from
the
crowd
now
pressing
at
his
horse
heels
determining
if
the
hounds
did
run
into
their
fox
in
the
park
to
ride
them
off
the
scent
at
the
very
first
opportunity
the
being
still
alive
within
him
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
leaped
the
leading
out
of
the
shrubberies
into
the
park
the
noise
the
horse
made
in
taking
off
resembling
the
trampling
on
it
but
it
exclaimed
he
as
the
horse
slid
two
or
three
yards
as
he
alighted
on
the
frozen
field
george
cheek
followed
him
and
taking
the
bit
deliberately
between
his
teeth
just
walked
through
the
gate
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
paper
ye
brute
groaned
sponge
in
disgust
digging
the
latchfords
into
his
sides
as
if
he
intended
to
make
them
meet
in
the
middle
ye
brute
repeated
he
giving
him
a
hearty
cropper
as
he
put
up
his
head
after
trying
to
kick
him
off
you
exclaimed
miss
glitters
cantering
up
adding
cleared
the
way
nicely
for
me
nicely
he
had
cleared
it
for
them
all
and
the
tide
of
equestrianism
now
poured
over
the
park
like
the
flood
of
an
irrigated
water
meadow
such
ponies
such
horses
such
hugging
such
kicking
such
scrambling
and
so
little
progress
with
many
the
park
being
extensive
three
hundred
acres
or
more
there
was
ample
space
for
the
aspiring
ones
to
single
themselves
out
and
as
lady
scattercash
and
orlando
sat
in
the
on
the
rising
ground
by
the
keeper
house
they
saw
a
horseman
george
cheek
old
gingerbread
boots
as
they
called
sponge
with
lucy
glitters
alongside
of
him
gradually
stealing
away
from
the
crowd
and
creeping
up
to
watchorn
who
was
sailing
away
with
the
hounds
a
scrimmage
exclaimed
her
ladyship
standing
up
in
the
carriage
and
eyeing
the
strange
confusion
in
the
vale
below
bob
in
his
old
purple
said
she
eyeing
her
brother
hustling
along
there
fat
in
his
new
moses
and
son
and
bouncey
in
poor
wax
coat
and
there
harry
all
legs
and

as
usual
added
she
as
her

was
seen
it
along
there
lucy

where

observed
orlando
straining
his
eyes
after
the
scrambling
field
nothing
but
the
inspiriting
aid
of
and
the
hope
that
the
thing
would
soon
terminate
sustained
watchorn
under
the
infliction
in
which
he
so
unexpectedly
found
himself
for
nothing
would
have
tempted
him
to
brave
such
a
frost
with
the
burning
scent
of
a
game
fox
the
park
being
spacious
and
enclosed
by
a
high
plank
paling
he
hoped
the
fox
would
have
the
manners
to
confine
himself
within
it
and
so
long
as
his
threadings
and
windings
favoured
the
supposition
our
huntsman
bustled
along
yelling
and
screaming
in
apparent
ecstasy
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
hounds
to
be
sure
wanted
keeping
together
for
frantic
as
usual
had
shot
ahead
while
the
gorged
pigpailers
could
never
extricate
themselves
from
the
ponies
elongated
watchorn
rising
in
his
stirrups
and
looking
back
with
a
grin
at
george
cheek
who
was
plying
his
weed
with
the
whip
exclaiming
you
confounded
young
warmint
i
give
you
a
warmin
i
teach
you
to
jaw
about
as
he
turned
his
head
straight
to
look
at
his
hounds
he
was
shocked
to
see
frantic
falling
backwards
from
a
first
attempt
to
leap
the
and
just
as
she
gathered
herself
for
a
second
effort
desperate
chatterer
and
galloper
charged
in
line
and
got
over
then
came
the
general
rush
of
the
pack
attended
with
the
usual
success
some
over
some
back
some
of
others
the
devil
exclaimed
watchorn
pulling
up
short
in
a
perfect
agony
of
despair
the
devil
repeated
he
in
a
lower
tone
as
sponge
approached
there
a
gate
roared
our
friend
skating
up
there
never
a
gate
within
a
mile
and
that
locked
replied
watchorn
sulkily
here
goes
replied
sponge
gathering
the
chestnut
together
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
purging
himself
of
his
previous
goes
repeated
he
thrusting
his
hard
hat
firmly
on
his
head
taking
his
horse
back
a
few
paces
sponge
crammed
him
manfully
at
the
palings
and
got
over
with
a
rap
done

exclaimed
miss

in
delight
adding
to
watchorn

beardey
was
irresolute
he
pretended
to
be
anxious
to
get
the

over
the
way
then
exclaimed
miss
glitters
putting
her
horse
back
her
bright
eyes
flashing
as
she
spoke
she
took
him
back
as
far
as
sponge
had
done
touched
him
with
the
whip
and
in
an
instant
she
was
high
in
the
air
landing
safely
on
the

side
exclaimed

by

giving
him
a
hearty
with
his

ran
him
full
tilt
at

palings
and
carried
away
half

in

in

the
scene
then
changed
in
lieu
of
the
green
though
hard
sward
of
the
undulating
park
our
friends
now
found
themselves
on
large
frozen
fallows
upon
whose
uneven
surface
the
heaviest
horses
made
no
impression
while
the
shuffling
rats
of
ponies
toiled
and
floundered
about
almost
receding
in
their
progress

was
just
topping
the
fence
out
of
the
first
one
and
miss
glitters
was
gathering
her
horse
to
ride
at
it
as
watchorn
and
emerged
from
the
park
rounding
the
beyond
the
leading
hounds
were
racing
with
a
scent
followed
by
the
pack
in
file
a
mess
said
watchorn
to
himself
shading
the
sun
from
his
eyes
with
his
hand
when
remembering
his
he
exclaimed
they
go
as
if
in
ecstasies
at
the
sight
seeing
a
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
field
he
got
his
horse
by
the
head
and
rattled
him
across
the
fallow
blowing
his
horn
more
in
hopes
of
stopping
the
pack
than
with
a
view
of
bringing
up
the
he
might
have
saved
his
breath
for
the
music
of
the
pack
completely
drowned
the
noise
of
the
horn

said
he
thumping
the
broad
end
against
his
thigh
wish
i
was
quietly
back
in
my
parlour
hold
up
horse
roared
he
as
harkaway
nearly
came
on
his
haunches
in
pulling
up
at
the
gate
know
who
cardinal
wiseman
continued
he
stooping
to
open
it
the
gate
was
fast
and
he
had
to
alight
and
lift
it
off
its
hinges
just
as
he
had
done
so
and
had
got
it
sufficiently
open
for
a
horse
to
pass
george
cheek
came
up
from
behind
and
slipped
through
before
him
you
unrighteous
young
renegade
did
ever
mortal
see
sich
an
uncivilized
trick
roared
watchorn
adding
as
he
climbed
on
to
his
horse
again
and
went
spluttering
through
the
frozen
turnips
after
the
offender
no
with
lord
john
manners
i
think
dear
oh
dear
exclaimed
he
as
his
horse
nearly
came
on
his
head
this
is
the
most
punishin
affair
i
ever
was
in
at
puseyism
to
it
and
thereupon
he
indulged
in
no
end
of
anathemas
at
slarkey
for
bringing
the
wrong
fox
time
to
take
soundings
and
cast
anchor
is
it
gasped
captain
bouncey
toiling
up
on
his
pulling
horse
in
a
state
of
utter
exhaustion
as
watchorn
stood
craneing
and
looking
at
a
rasper
through
which
sponge
and
miss
glitters
had
passed
without
disturbing
a
twig
a
s
t
anchor
exclaimed
watchorn
in
a
tone
of
derision
this
yet
i
hope
not
this
forty
minnits
yet
i
hope
not
this
hour
and
twenty
minnits
yet
i
hope
continued
he
putting
his
horse
irresolutely
at
the
fence
the
horse
blundered
through
it
barking
watchorn
nose
with
a
branch
rot
it
cut
off
my
nose
exclaimed
he
muffling
it
up
in
his
hand
off
my
nose
clean
by
my
face
i
do
believe
continued
he
venturing
to
look
into
his
hand
for
it
said
he
eyeing
the
slight
stain
of
blood
on
his
glove
will
be
a
lesson
to
me
as
long
as
i
live
if
ever
i
again
in
a
frost
may
i
be
thank
goodness
they
checked
at
last
exclaimed
he
as
the
music
suddenly
ceased
and
sponge
and
miss
glitters
sat
motionless
together
on
their
panting
smoking
steeds
watchorn
then
stuck
spurs
to
his
horse
and
being
now
on
a
flat
rushy
pasture
with
a
into
the
field
where
the
hounds
were
casting
he
hustled
across
preparing
his
horn
for
a
blow
as
soon
as
he
got
there
twang
twang
twang
he
went
riding
up
the
hedgerow
in
the
contrary
direction
to
what
the
hounds
leant
twang
twang
he
continued
inwardly
congratulating
himself
that
the
fox
would
never
face
the
troop
of
urchins
he
saw
coming
down
with
their
guns
him
he
never
that
way
observed
sponge
to
miss
glitters
never
that
way
repeated
he
seeing
how
frantic
flung
to
the
right
twang
twang
went
the
horn
but
the
hounds
regarded
it
not
sponge
put
the
hounds
to
me
roared
watchorn
dreading
lest
they
might
hit
off
the
scent
sponge
answered
the
appeal
by
turning
his
horse
the
way
the
hounds
were
feathering
and
giving
them
a
slight
cheer
rot
it
roared
watchorn
let
alone
that
a
fox
ours
is
over
the
pointing
towards
bonnyfield
hill
hallooed
sponge
taking
off
his
hat
as
frantic
hit
off
the
scent
to
the
right
and
galloper
and
melody
and
all
the
rest
scored
to
cry
you
confounded
beggar
exclaimed
watchorn
returning
his
horn
to
its
case
and
eyeing
sponge
and
miss
glitters
sailing
away
with
the
again
pack
you
exorbitant
usurer
continued
he
gathering
his
horse
to
skate
after
them
now
the
most
disgraceful
proceedin
i
ever
saw
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
hang
me
if
i
stand
such
work
dash
me
but
i
the
queen
i
tell
sir
george
grey
i
write
to
walpole
hallooed
he
as
bob
spangles
and
bouncey
popped
upon
him
unexpectedly
from
behind
exclaiming
with
glee
as
he
pointed
to
the
streaming
pack
with
his
whip
dash
it
but
we
in
for
a
good
thing
little
bouncey
horse
was
still
yawning
and
and
bouncey
being
quite
unequal
to
riding
him
and
exhausted
him
against
a
in
the
middle
of
a
field
making
a
with
his
own
and
his
horse
head
and
was
immediately
the
centre
of
attraction
for
the
panting
tail
bouncey
got
near
a
pint
of
sherry
from
among
them
before
he
recovered
from
the
shock
so
anxious
were
they
about
him
that
not
one
of
them
thought
of
resuming
the
chase
even
the
lagging
whips
leave
him
george
cheek
was
presently
de
in
a
hedge
and
watchorn
seeing
him
exclaimed
as
he
slipped
through
a
gate
send
your
mar
to
you
you
young
watchorn
would
gladly
have
stopped
too
for
the
fumes
of
the
champagne
were
dead
within
him
and
the
riding
was
becoming
every
minute
more
dangerous
he
trotted
on
hoping
each
jump
of
brown
boots
would
be
the
last
and
inwardly
wishing
the
wearer
at
the
devil
thus
he
passed
through
a
considerable
extent
of
country
over
harrowdale
lordship
or
reputed
lordship
past
roundington
tower
down
sloppyside
banks
and
on
to
cheeseington
green
the
severity
of
his
affliction
being
alone
mitigated
by
the
intervention
of
accommodating
roads
and
lines
of
field
gates
these
however
sponge
generally
declined
and
went
crashing
on
now
over
high
places
now
over
low
just
as
they
came
in
his
way
closely
followed
by
the
fair
lucy
glitters
i
never
see

a

exclaimed
watchorn
eyeing
sponge
clearing
a
stiff
flight
of
rails
with
a
gap

at

added
he
as

did
the

continued
he
thumping
his
hand
against
his
thick
thigh
as
the
white
nearly
slipped
upon

hoop
screeched
he
as
he
saw

looking
back
to
see
where
he
was
repeated
he
adding
in
apparent
delight
eyes
but
we
in
for
a
stinger
hold
up

roared
he
as
his
horse
now
went
starring
up
to
the
knees
through
a
long
sheet
of
ice
squirting
the
clayey
water
into
his
rider

up
repeated
he
adding

every

the

adding
i

he
after
a
long
skate
down
the
grassy

of

as
on

gimmerhog
hill
he
saw
farmer

wheeling
and
clustering
indicative
of
the
fox
having

relief
at

repeated
he
reining
up
his
horse
to
see
the
hounds
charge
them
sponge
and
miss
glitters
were
now
in
the
bottom
below
fighting
their
way
across
a
broad
with
a
very
stiff
fence
on
the
side
up
roared
sponge
as
having
bored
a
hole
through
the
fence
he
found
himself
on
the
margin
of
the
the
horse
did
hold
up
and
landed
him
not
without
a
scramble
on
the
far
side
him
at
it
lucy
exclaimed
sponge
turning
his
horse
half
round
to
his
fair
companion
him
at
it
lucy
repeated
he
and
lucy
fortunately
hitting
the
gap
skimmed
the
water
like
a
swallow
on
a
summer
eve
done
you
a
trump
exclaimed
sponge
standing
in
his
stirrups
and
holding
on
by
the
mane
as
his
horse
rose
the
opposing
hill
he
just
got
up
in
time
to
save
the
muttons
another
second
and
the
hounds
would
have
been
into
them
holding
up
his
hand
to
beckon
lucy
to
stop
he
sat
eyeing
them
intently
many
of
them
had
their
heads
up
and
not
a
few
were
casting
sheep
eyes
at
the
sheep
some
few
of
the
line
hunters
were
persevering
with
the
scent
over
the
greasy
ground
it
was
a
critical
moment
they
cast
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
and
again
took
a
wider
sweep
in
advance
returning
however
towards
the
sheep
as
if
they
thought
them
the
best
spec
after
all
to
me
said
sponge
giving
miss
glitters
his
whip
to
me
said
he
hallooing
hounds
which
being
interpreted
means
again
hounds
here
again
the
conceited
beggar
exclaimed
watchorn
to
himself
as
disappointed
of
his
finish
he
sat
feeling
his
nose
mopping
his
face
and
watching
the
proceedings
the
conceited
beggar
repeated
he
adding
bouts
is
a
goin
to
kest
them
cast
them
however
he
did
proceeding
very
cautiously
in
the
direction
the
hounds
seemed
to
lean
they
were
on
a
piece
of
cold
scenting
ground
across
which
they
could
hardly
own
the
scent
hurry
cried
sponge
to
miss
glitters
who
was
acting
with
rather
unnecessary
vigour
as
they
got
under
the
lee
of
the
hedge
the
scent
improved
a
little
and
from
an
occasional
feathering
stern
a
hound
or
two
indulged
in
a
whimper
until
at
length
they
fairly
broke
out
in
a
cry
lose
a
shoe
said
watchorn
to
himself
looking
first
at
the
formidable
leap
before
him
and
then
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
coming
up
behind
lose
a
shoe
said
he
notion
of
lippin
of
a
navigable
river
a
downright
arm
of
the
sea
added
he
getting
off
forward
screeched
sponge
capping
the
hounds
on
when
away
they
went
heads
up
and
sterns
down
as
before
mimicked
watchorn
adding
enough
at
all
events
after
running
about
of
a
mile
at
best
pace
sponge
viewed
the
fox
crossing
a
large
grass
field
with
all
the
steam
up
he
could
raise
a
few
hundred
yards
ahead
of
the
pack
who
were
streaming
along
most
beautifully
not
viewing
but
gradually
gaining
upon
him
at
last
they
broke
from
scent
to
view
and
presently
rolled
him
over
and
over
among
them
screamed
sponge
throwing
himself
off
his
horse
and
rushing
in
amongst
them
repeated
he
still
louder
holding
the
fox
up
in
grim
death
above
the
baying
pack
exclaimed
miss
glitters
reining
up
in
delight
alongside
the
chestnut
repeated
she
diving
into
the
for
her
handkerchief
me
my
whip
cried
sponge
repelling
the
attacks
of
the
hounds
from
behind
with
his
heels
having
got
it
he
threw
the
fox
on
the
ground
and
clearing
a
circle
he
off
with
his
brush
in
an
instant
him
and
eat
him
cried
he
as
the
pack
broke
in
on
the
carcass
him
and
eat
him
repeated
he
as
he
made
his
way
up
to
miss
glitters
with
the
brush
exclaiming
put
this
in
your
hat
alongside
the
cock

the
fair
lady
leant
towards
him
and
as
he
adjusted
it
becomingly
in
her
hat
looking
at
her
bewitching
eyes
her
lovely
face
and
feeling
the
sweet
fragrance
of
her
breath
a
something
shot
through
sponge
coat
his
corduroy
waistcoat
his
eureka
shirt
angola
vest
and
penetrated
the
very
cockles
of
his
heart
he
gave
her
such
a
series
of
smacking
kisses
as
startled
her
horse
and
astonished
a
poacher
who
happened
to
be
hid
in
the
adjoining
hedge
sponge
was
never
so
happy
in
his
life
he
could
have
stood
on
his

or
been
guilty
of
any
sort
of
extravagance
short
of
wasting
his
money
oh
he
was
happy
oh
he
was
joyous
he
was
intoxicated
with
pleasure
as
he
eyed
his
angelic
charmer
her
lustrous
eyes
her
glowing
cheeks
her
pearly
teeth
the
bewitching
fulness
of
her
elegant
and

lucy
was
an
angel
about
that
there
was
no
dispute
he
would
make
her
sponge
at
all
events
touring

very
expensive
he
could
only
counterbalance
the
extravagance
of
inns
by
the
rigid
rule
of
giving
nothing
to
servants
at
private
houses

thought

for
your
thoughts
repeated
she
as
sponge
sauntered
leisurely
along
regardless
of
the
bitter
cold
followed
by
such
of
the
hounds
as
chose
to
accompany
him
replied
he
brightening
up
was
just
thinking
what
a
deuced
good
run
we
had
pouted
the
fair
lady
my
darling
i
was
thinking
what
a
very
pretty
girl
you
are
rejoined
he
sidling
his
horse
up
and
encircling
her
neat
waist
with
his
arm
a
sweet
smile
dimpled
her
plump
cheeks
and
chased
the
recollection
of
the
former
answer
away
it
would
not
be
pretty
indeed
we
could
not
pretend
to
give
even
the
outline
of
the
conversation
that
followed
it
was
carried
on
in
such
broken
and
disjointed
sentences
eyes
and
squeezes
doing
so
much
more
work
than
words
that
even
a
reporter
would
have
had
to
draw
largely
upon
his
imagination
for
the
substance
suffice
it
to
say
that
though
the
thermometer
was
below
zero
they
never
moved
out
of
a
foot
pace
the
very
hounds
growing
tired
of
the
trail
and
slinking
off
one
by
one
as
the
opportunity
occurred
a
dazzling
sun
was
going
down
with
a
glare
and
the
partially
softened
ground
was
fast
resuming
its
fretwork
of
frost
as
our
hero
and
heroine
were
seen
sauntering
up
the
western
avenue
to
nonsuch
house
as
slowly
and
quietly
as
if
it
had
been
the
hottest
evening
in
summer
old
coppertops
exclaimed
captain
seedeybuck
as
turning
round
in
the
to
chalk
his
cue
he
espied
them
crawling
along
lucy
added
he
as
he
stood
watching
them
slowly
they
come
observed
bob
spangles
going
to
the
window
have
tired
their
horses
suggested
captain
quod
the
sort
of
man
to
tire
a
horse
rejoined
bob
spangles
that
sponge
observed
captain
cutitfat
do
i
replied
captain
quod
never
mind
the
beggar
it
you
to
play
exclaimed
bob
spangles
to
captain
seedeybuck
but
lady
scattercash
who
was
observing
our
friends
from
her
boudoir
window
saw
with
a
woman
eye
that
there
was
something
more
than
a
mere
case
of
tired
horses
and
tripping
downstairs
she
arrived
at
the
front
door
just
as
the
fair
lucy
dropped
smilingly
from
her
horse
into
sponge
extended
arms
hurrying
up
into
the
boudoir
lucy
gave
her
ladyship
one
of
sponge
modified
kisses
revealing
the
truth
more
eloquently
than
words
could
convey
lady
scattercash
was
glad
delighted
charmed
sponge
was
a
man
and
she
was
sure
he
was
rich
could
hunt
if
he
was
would
advise
lucy
to
have
a
good
settlement
in
case
he
broke
his
neck
and
was
most
useful
no
husband
ever
let
his
wife
have
enough
money
must
forget
all
about
harry
dacre
and
charley
brown
and
the
swell
in
the
blues
must
be
prudent
for
the
future
sponge
would
never
know
anything
of
the
past
then
she
reverted
to
the
interesting
subject
of
settlements
had
sponge
got
and
what
would
he
do
this
lucy
could
tell
he
told
her
where
is
estates
were
was
his
dad
dead
this
lucy
did
know
either
they
had
got
no
further
than
the
tender
prop
well
would
get
it
all
out
of
him
by
degrees
and
with
the
reiteration
of
her
glads
and
the
repayment
of
the
kiss
lucy
had
advanced
her
ladyship
advised
her
to
get
off
her
habit
and
make
herself
comfortable
while
she
ran
downstairs
to
communicate
the
astonishing
intelligence
to
the
party
below

she
bursting
into
the
where
the
party
were
still
engaged
in
a
game
at

sported
his

in

for
nothing

better

captain

that
asked
lady

fat
coolly
but
he
has
a
very
good
property

her

i

rejoined
fat
in

retorted
her

great
expectations
from
an

added
she
he
looks
like
a

to

on
good
terms
with
his

sneered
captain

no

he
pays

many
a

seedeybuck
that

seedey

said
seedey
with
an
emphasis

settling

illustration
sponge
was
most
warmly
congratulated
by
sir
harry
and
all
the
assembled
captains
who
inwardly
hoped
his
marriage
would
have
the
effect
of
him
out
as
they
said
and
they
had
a
most
glorious
jollification
on
the
strength
of
it
they
drank
lucy
and
his
health
nine
times
over
with
nine
times
nine
each
time
the
consequence
was
that
the
footmen
and
shutter
were
in
earlier
requisition
than
usual
to
carry
them
to
their
respective
apartments
sponge
head
throbbed
a
good
deal
the
next
morning
nor
was
the
pulsation
abated
by
the
recollection
of
his
matrimonial
engagement
and
his
total
inability
to
keep
the
angel
who
had
ridden
herself
into
his
affections
however
like
all
untried
men
he
was
strong
in
the
confidence
of
his
own
ability
and
the
sight
of
his
smiling
charmer
chased
away
all
prudential
considerations
as
quickly
as
they
arose
he
made
no
doubt
there
would
something
turn
up
meanwhile
he
was
in
good
quarters
and
lady
scattercash
having
warmly
espoused
his
cause
he
assumed
a
considerable
standing
in
the
establishment
old
beardey
having
ventured
to
complain
of
his
interference
in
the
kennel
my
lady
curtly
told
him
he
might
himself
scarce
if
he
liked
a
step
that
beardey
was
quite
ready
to
take
having
heard
of
a
desirable

newington
butts
provided
sir
harry
paid
him
his
wages
this
not
being
quite
convenient
sir
harry
gave
him
an
order
on
and
for
three
suits
of
clothes
and
acquiesced
in
his
taking
a
massive
silver
on
which
beneath
the
many
quartered
scattercash
arms
watchorn
placed
an
inscription
stating
that
it
was
presented
to
him
by
sir
harry
scattercash
baronet
and
the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
of
his
hunt
in
admiration
of
his
talents
as
a
huntsman
and
his
character
as
a
man
sponge
then
became
still
more
at
home
it
was
very
soon
hounds

horses
and

he
wrote
to
jawleyford
and
puffington
and
guano
and
lumpleg

to
make

to

even
to
mount
them
if
required
his
was
quite
neglected
in
favour
of
lucy
and
it
says
much
for
the
influence
of
female
charms
that
before
they
had
been
engaged
a
fortnight
he
who
had
been
a
perfect
oracle
in
cab
fares
would
have
been
puzzled
to
tell
the
most
ordinary
fare
on
the
most
frequented
route
he
had
forgotten
all
about
them
nevertheless
lucy
and
he
went
out
hunting
as
often
as
they
could
raise
hounds
and
when
they
had
a
good
run
and
killed
he
saluted
her
and
when
they
did
kill
why
he
just
did
the
same
he
headed
and
tailed
the
stringing
pack
drafted
the
skirters
and
babblers
which
he
sent
to
lord
scamperdale
with
his
compliments
and
presently
had
the
uneven
kennel
in
something
like
shape
illustration
nor
was
this
the
only
way
in
which
he
made
himself
useful
for
nonsuch
house
being
now
supported
almost
entirely
by
voluntary
contributions
that
is
to
say
by
the
gullibility
of
tradesmen
his
street
and
shop
knowledge
was
valuable
in
determining
who

down
came
the

with
such
alacrity
such
thanks
for
the
past
and
hopes
for
the
future
as
we
poor
devils
of
the
untitled
world
are
quite
unacquainted
with

not
content
with
giving

of

paid

here
in
the
midst
of
love
luxury
and
let
us
for
a
time
leave
our
enterprising
friend
sponge
while
we
take
a
look
at
a
species
of
cruelty
that
some
people
call
for
this
purpose
we
will
begin
a
fresh
chapter
chapter
lxvii
how
they
got
up
the
aristocratic
there
is
no
saying
what
advantages
railway
communication
may
confer
upon
a
country
but
for
the
granddiddle
junction
shire
never
would
have
had
a
an
at
least
for
it
is
observable
that
the
more
snobbish
a
thing
is
the
more
certain
they
are
to
call
it
aristocratic
when
it
is
too
bad
for
anything
they
call
it
well
as
we
said
before
but
for
the
granddiddle
junction
shire
would
never
have
had
a
aristocratic
a
few
friends
or
farmers
might
have
got
up
a
quiet
thing
among
themselves
but
it
would
never
have
seen
a
regular
trade
transaction
with
its
swell
mob
sham
captains
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
odd
laying
tips
and
market
rigging
who
will
deny
the
benefit
that
must
accrue
to
any
locality
by
the
infusion
of
all
the
loose
fish
of
the
kingdom
formerly
the
were
the
perquisite
of
the
publicans
they
it
was
who
arranged
for
shaggy

to
pound
harry
billy
nob
upon
land
the
preference
being
given
to
the
locality
that
subscribed
the
most
money
to
the
fight
since
the
decline
of

and
that
still
smaller
grade
of
gambling
coursing
have
come
to
their
aid
of
the
and
are
got
up
by
for
the
good
of
their
houses
some
of
the
town
publicans
indeed
seem
to
think
that
the
country
was
just
made
for
their
matches
to
come
off
in
and
scarcely
condescend
to
ask
the
leave
of
the
landowners
we
saw
an
advertisement
the
other
day
where
a
low
publican
in
a
manufacturing
town
assured
the
subscribers
to
his
that
he
would
take
care
to
select
open
ground
with
of
stout
hares
as
if
all
the
estates
in
the
neighbourhood
were
at
his
command

was
got
up
on
the
principle
whatever
benefit
the
granddiddle
junction
conferred
upon
the
country
at
large
it
had
a
very
prejudicial
effect
upon
the
old
duke
of
cumberland
hotel
and
posting
house
which
it
left
high
and
dry
at
an
angle
sufficiently
near
to
be
tantalized
by
the
whirr
and
the
whistle
of
the
trains
and
yet
too
far
off
to
be
benefited
by
the
parties
they
brought
this
once
hostelry
was
kept
by
one
viney
a
former
butler
in
the
scattercash
family
and
who
still
retained
the
usual
and
faithful
servant
of
nonsuch
house
having
his
beefsteak
and
bottle
of
wine
in
the
steward
room
whenever
he
chose
to
call
viney
had
done
good
at
the
old
duke
of
cumberland
and
no
one
seeing
him
fig
would
recognize
in
the
solemn
grandeur
of
his
stately
person
the
dirty
who
had
filled
the
place
now
occupied
by
the
still
dirtier
slarkey
but
the
days
of
road
travelling
departed
and
viney
who
beneath
the
portico
of
his
hotel
modulated
the
ovations
of
his
cauliflower
head
to
every
description
of
traveller
from
the
lordly
occupant
of
the
down
to
the
humble
sitter
in
a
gig
was
cut
off
by
one
fell
swoop
from
all
further
traffic
he
was
extinguished
like
a
gaslight
and
the
pipe
was
laid
on
a
fresh
line
fortunately
viney
was
pretty
warm
he
had
done
pretty
well
and
having
enjoyed
the
intimacy
of
the
great
of
railway
times
had
got
a
hint
not
to
engage
the
hotel
beyond
the
opening
of
the
line
consequently
he
now
had
the
great
house
for
a
mere
nothing
until
such
times
as
the
owner
could
convert
it
into
that
last
refuge
for
deserted
houses
an
academy
or
a
ladies
seminary
viney
now
having
plenty
of
leisure
frequently
drove
his
once
a
lady
maid
in
a
quality
family
up
to
nonsuch
house
as
well
for
the
sake
of
the
airing
for
the
road
was
pleasant
and
picturesque
as
to
see
if
he
could
get
the
trifle
sir
harry
owed
him
for
bottles
of
and
such
trifles
as
country
gentlemen
run
up
scores
for
at
their
scores
that
seldom
get
smaller
by
standing
in
these
excursions
viney
made
the
acquaintance
of
watchorn
and
a
huntsman
being
a
character
with
whom
even
the
landlord
of
an
inn
we
beg
pardon
hotel
and
may
associate
without
degradation
viney
and
watchorn
became
intimate
watchorn
sympathized
with
viney
and
never
failed
to
take
a
glass
in
passing
either
at
exercise
or
out
hunting
to
deplore
that
such
a
house
so
the
station
too
should
be
ruined
as
an
inn
it
was
after
a
more
than
usual
libation
that
watchorn
trotting
merrily
along
with
the
hounds
having
accomplished
three
blank
days
in
succession
asked
himself
as
he
looked
upon
the
surrounding
vale
from
the
rising
ground
of
hammercock
hill
with
the
station
and
the
hotel
peeping
through
the
trees
whether
something
might
not
be
done
to
give
the
latter
a
lift
at
first
he
thought
of
a
pigeon
match
a
sweepstake
open
to
all
england
fifty
members
say
at
two
pound
ten
each
seven
pigeons
seven
sparrows
yards
rise
two
ounces
of
shot
and
so
on
but
then
again
he
thought
there
would
be
a
difficulty
in
getting
guns
a
coursing
match
how
would
that
do
answer
hares
the
farmers
had
made
such
an
outcry
about
the
game
that
the
landowners
had
shot
them
all
off
and
now
the
farmers
were
grumbling
that
they
could
get
a
course
my
buttons
exclaimed
watchorn
would
be
the
very
thing
for
a
there
old
puff
hounds
and
old
scamp
hounds
and
these
hounds
looking
down
on
the
lot
around
him
the
deuce
is
in
it
if
we
could
give
the
thing
such
a
start
as
would
bring
down
the
lads
of
the
village
and
a
vast
amount
of
good
business
might
be
done
i
dashed
if
it
is
the
very
country
for
a
continued
watchorn
casting
his
eye
over
cloverly
park
round
the
enclosure
of
langworth
grange
and
up
the
rising
ground
of
lark
lodge
the
more
watchorn
thought
of
it
the
more
he
was
satisfied
of
its
feasibility
and
he
trotted
over
the
next
day
to
the
old
duke
of
cumberland
to
see
his
friend
on
the
subject
viney
like
most
victuallers
was
more
given
to
games
of
skill
billiards
shuttlecock
skittles
dominoes
and
so
on
than
to
the
rude
chances
of
flood
and
field
and
at
first
he
doubted
his
ability
to
grapple
with
the
details
but
on
watchorn
assurance
that
he
would
keep
him
straight
he
gave
viney
a
key
desiring
her
to
go
into
the
inner
cellar
and
bring
out
a
bottle
of
the
green
seal
this
was
sherry
very
good
stuff
to
take
and
by
the
time
they
got
into
the
second
bottle
they
had
got
into
the
middle
of
the
scheme
too
viney
was
cautious
and
thoughtful
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
watchorn
sagacity
and
so
long
as
watchorn
confined
himself
to
weights
and
stakes
and
forfeits
and
so
on
he
was
content
to
leave
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
huntsman
but
when
watchorn
came
to
talk
of
putting
this
person
and
that
together
viney
experience
came
in
aid
viney
knew
a
good
deal
he
had
not
stood
twisting
a
napkin
negligently
before
a
sideboard
without
picking
up
a
good
many
waifs
and
strays
in
the
shape
of
those
ins
and
outs
those
likings
and
dislikings
those
hatreds
and
jealousies
that
foolish
people
let
fall
so
freely
before
servants
as
if
for
all
the
world
the
servants
were
sideboards
themselves
and
he
had
kept
up
his
stock
of
knowledge
by
a
liberal
though
not
a
intercourse
for
there
is
no
greater
aristocrat
than
your
servant
among
the
upper
servants
of
all
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood
so
that
he
knew
to
a
nicety
who
would
pull
together
and
who
would
whose
name
it
would
not
do
to
mention
to
this
person
and
who
it
would
not
do
to
apply
to
before
that
neither
watchorn
nor
viney
being
sportsmen
they
thought
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
apply
to
two
friends
who
were
and
after
thinking
over
who
hunted
in
couples
they
were
unfortunate
enough
to
select
our
flat
hat
friends
fyle
and
fossick
fyle
was
indignant
beyond
measure
at
being
asked
to
be
steward
to
a
and
thrust
the
application
into
the
fire
while
fossick
just
wrote
below
see
you
hanged
first
and
sent
it
back
without
putting
even
a
fresh
head
on
the
envelope
nothing
daunted
however
they
returned
to
the
charge
and
without
troubling
the
reader
with
unnecessary
detail
we
think
it
will
be
generally
admitted
that
they
at
length
made
an
excellent
selection
in
puffington
guano
and
tom
washball
illustration
viney
and
watchorn
getting
up
grand
aristocratic
fortune
favoured
them
also
in
getting
a
locality
to
run
in
for
timothy
scourgefield
of
broom
hill
whose
farm
commanded
a
good
circular
three
miles
of
country
with
every
variety
of
obstacle
having
thrown
up
his
lease
for
a
reduction
a
giving
up
that
had
been
most
unhandsomely
accepted
by
his
landlord
timothy
was
most
anxious
to
pay
him
off
by
doing
every
conceivable
injury
to
the
farm
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
promising
than
having
a
run
over
it
scourgefield
therefore
readily
agreed
to
let
viney
and
watchorn
do
whatever
they
liked
on
condition
that
he
received
at
the
gate
the
name
occupied
their
attention
some
time
for
it
did
not
begin
as
the
the
national
the
naval
and
military
the
the
the
the
were
all
considered
and
canvassed
and
its
being
called
the
at
length
turned
upon
whether
they
got
lord
scamperdale
to
subscribe
or
not
this
was
accomplished
by
a
deferential
call
by
viney
upon
spraggon
with
a
little
bill
for
three
pound
odd
which
he
presented
with
the
most
urgent
request
that
jack
would
think
of
it
then
any
time
that
was
most
convenient
to
spraggon
and
then
the
introduction
of
the
it
was
lucky
that
viney
was
so
easily
satisfied
for
poor
jack
had
only
thirty
shillings
of
which
he
owed
his
washerwoman
eight
and
he
was
very
glad
to
stuff
viney
bill
into
his
stunner
and
apply
himself
exclusively
to
the
contemplated
like
most
of
us
jack
had
no
objection
to
make
a
little
money
and
as
he
squinted
his
frightful
eyes
inside
out
at
the
paper
he
thought
over
what
horses
they
had
in
the
stable
that
were
like
the
thing
and
then
he
sounded
viney
as
to
whether
he
would
put
him
one
up
for
nothing
if
he
could
induce
his
lordship
to
send
this
of
course
viney
readily
assented
to
and
again
requesting
jack
not
to
of
his
little
bill
till
it
was
convenient
to
him
a
favour
that
jack
was
pretty
sure
to
accord
him
viney
took
his
departure
jack
undertaking
to
write
him
the
result
the
next
day
post
brought
viney
the
document
unpaid
of
course
with
a
great
scrawled
across
the
top
and
forthwith
it
was
decided
that
the
should
be
called
the
aristocratic
other
names
quickly
followed
and
it
soon
assumed
an
importance
advertisements
appeared
in
all
the
sporting
and
sporting
papers
headed
with
the
imposing
names
of
the
stewards
secretary
and
clerk
of
the
course
viney
the
aristocratic
stakes
of
sovs
each
and
only
if
declared
the
winner
to
give
two
dozen
of
champagne
to
the
ordinary
and
the
second
horse
to
save
his
stake
gentlemen
riders
titled
ones
to
be
allowed
over
about
three
miles
of
fine
hunting
country
under
the
usual
conditions
then
the
game
of
the
toms
and
sams
and
joes
and
jems
with
their
tips
and
distribution
of
prints
began
tom
counselling
his
numerous
and
daily
increasing
clients
to
get
well
on
to
no
sardanapalus
the
as
watchorn
called
him
while
recommended
his
friends
and
patrons
to
be
sweet
on
no
hercules
and
jem
was
all
for
something
else
a
gentleman
who
took
the
trouble
of
getting
tips
from
half
a
dozen
of
them
found
that
no
two
of
them
agreed
in
any
particular
what
information
to
make
books
upon
what
good
as
our
excellent
friend
thackeray
eloquently
asks
came
out
of
or
went
into
a
betting
book
if
i
could
be
caliph
omar
for
a
week
says
he
would
pitch
every
one
of
those
despicable
manuscripts
into
the
flames
from
who
is
in
with
jack
snaffle
stable
and
is
overreaching
rogues
and
swindling
greenhorns
down
to
sam
the
butcher
boy
who
books
odds
in
the
and
stands
to
win
bob
we
say
ditto
to
that
and
are
not
sure
that
we
would
hang
a
or
a
man
or
two
into
the
bargain
watchorn
had
a
prophet
of
his
own
one
enoch
wriggle
who
having
tried
his
hand
unsuccessfully
first
at
tailoring
next
as
an
accountant
then
in
the
watercress
afterwards
in
the
buy
and
lastly
in
the
stale
lobster
and
periwinkle
line
had
set
up
as
an
oracle
on
turf
matters
forwarding
the
most
accurate
and
infallible
information
to
flats
in
exchange
for
heading
his
advertisements
it
be
a
sin
to
covet
honour
i
am
the
most
offending
soul
alive
enoch
did
a
considerable
stroke
of
business
and
couched
his
advice
in
such
dubious
terms
as
generally
to
be
able
to
claim
a
victory
whichever
way
the
thing
went
so
the
soul
prospered
and
from
scarcely
having
shoes
to
his
feet
he
very
soon
set
up
a
gig
chapter
lxviii
how
the
aristocratic
came
off
are
generally
crude
things
few
sportsmen
will
act
as
stewards
a
second
time
while
the
victim
to
the
popular
delusion
of
patronizing
our
sports
considers
like
gentlemen
who
have
served
the
office
of
sheriff
or
that
once
in
a
lifetime
is
enough
hence
there
is
always
the
air
of
amateur
actorship
about
them
there
is
always
something
wanting
or
forgotten
either
they
forget
the
ropes
or
they
forget
the
scales
or
they
forget
the
weights
or
they
forget
the
bell
or
more
commonly
still
some
of
the
parties
forget
themselves
farmers
too
are
easily
satisfied
with
the
benefits
of
an
irresponsible
mob
careering
over
their
farms
even
though
some
of
them
are
attired
in
the
miscellaneous
garb
of
hunting
and
racing
costume
indeed
it
is
just
this
mixture
of
two
sports
that
spoils
both
being
neither
hunting
nor
racing
it
has
not
the
wild
excitement
of
the
one
nor
the
accurate
calculating
qualities
of
the
other
the
very
horses
have
a
peculiar
air
about
them
neither
hunters
nor
hacks
nor
yet
exactly
some
of
them
doubtless
are
fine
animals
but
the
majority
are
lean
lathy
brutes
lacking
all
the
lively
energy
that
characterizes
the
movements
of
the
hunter
in
the
early
days
of
a
popular
fiction
existed
that
the
horses
were
hunters
and
grooms
and
fellows
used
to
come
nicking
and
grinning
up
to
masters
of
hounds
at
checks
and
critical
times
requesting
them
to
note
that
they
were
out
in
order
to
ask
for
certificates
of
the
horses
having
been
hunted
a
species
of
regularity
than
which
nothing
could
be
more
irregular
that
nuisance
thank
goodness
is
abated
a
now
generally
stands
on
his
own
merits
a
change
for
which
sportsmen
may
be
thankful
but
to
our
story
the
whole
country
was
in
a
commotion
about
this
the
unsophisticated
looked
upon
it
as
a
grand
of
the
aristocracy
and
smart
bonnets
and
cloaks
and
jackets
and
parasols
were
ordered
with
the
liberality
incident
to
a
distant
view
of
christmas
as
viney
sipped
his
of
an
evening
he
laughed
at
the
idea
of
a
like
himself
raising
such
a
dust
letters
came
pouring
in
to
the
clerk
of
the
course
from
all
quarters
some
asking
about
beds
some
about
breakfasts
some
about
stakes
some
about
stables
some
about
this
thing
some
about
that
every
room
in
the
old
duke
of
cumberland
was
speedily
bespoke
rose
in
price
and
dobbin
and
smiler
and
jumper
and
cappy
and
jessy
and
tumbler
were
jobbed
from
the
neighbouring
farmers
and
converted
for
the
occasion
into
posters
at
last
came
the
great
and
important
day
day
big
with
the
fate
of
thousands
of
pounds
for
the
vermin
had
been
plying
their
trade
briskly
throughout
the
kingdom
and
all
sorts
of
rumours
had
been
raised
relative
to
the
qualities
and
conditions
of
the
horses
who
does
know
the
chilling
feel
of
an
english
spring
or
rather
of
a
day
at
the
turn
of
the
year
before
there
is
any
spring
our
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
order
a
white
frost
succeeded
by
a
bright
sun
with
an
east
wind
warming
one
side
of
the
face
and
starving
the
other
it
was
neither
a
day
for
fishing
nor
hunting
nor
coursing
nor
anything
but
farming
the
country
save
where
there
were
a
few
lingering
patches
of
turnips
was
all
one
dingy
drab
with
abundant
scalds
on
the
undrained
fallows
the
grass
was
more
like
hemp
than
anything
else
the
very
rushes
were
yellow
and
sickly
long
before
midday
the
whole
country
was
in
commotion
the
same
sort
of
people
commingled
that
one
would
expect
to
see
if
there
was
a
balloon
to
go
up
and
a
man
to
go
down
or
be
hung
at
the
same
place
fine
ladies
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
swarthy
dames
with
their
stalwart
comrades
gentle
young
people
from
behind
the
counter
dandy
candy
merchants
from
behind
the
hedge
dandies
with
their
whips
and
shaggyford
roughs
in
their
baggy
coats
and
formidable
clubs
carriages
and
four
and
carriages
and
pairs
and
gigs
and
and
whitechapels
and
newport
pagnels
and
long
carts
and
short
carts
and
donkey
carts
converged
from
all
quarters
upon
the
point
of
attraction
at
broom
hill
if
farmer
scourgefield
had
made
a
mob
he
could
not
have
got
one
that
would
be
more
likely
to
do
damage
to
his
farm
than
this
one
nor
was
the
assemblage
confined
to
the
people
of
the
country
for
the
granddiddle
junction
by
its
connection
with
the
great
network
of
railways
enabled
all
patrons
of
this
truly
national
sport
to
sweep
down
upon
the
spot
like
flocks
of
wolves
and
train
after
train
disgorged
a
generous
mixture
of
sharps
and
flats
commingling
with
coatless
vagabonds
the
emissaries
most
likely
of
the
peeping
toms
and
infallible
joes
if
not
the
worthies
themselves
but
it
a
noble
sight
exclaimed
viney
to
watchorn
as
they
sat
on
their
horses
below
a
rickety
scaffold
labelled
stand
admission
raised
against
wall
eyeing
the
population
pouring
in
from
all
parts
but
it
a
noble
sight

shading
the

from
his

endeavouring
to

the
different

in

what

how
great
viney
was
some
people
who
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
horses
think
it
incumbent
upon
them
when
they
have
to
sport
and
accordingly
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
viney
appears
in
a
pair
of
remarkably
hard
tight
boots
above
which
are
a
pair
of
baggy
white
cords
with
the
dirty
of
the
tailor
still
upon
them
he
sports
a
green
cutaway
coat
with
a
black
satin
waistcoat
and
a
new
white
silk
hat
that
shines
in
the
bright
sun
like
a

kerchief

secured
by
a
butterfly
brooch
who
ever
saw
an
innkeeper
that
could
resist
a
brooch
he
is
riding
a
miserable
rat
of
a
badly
clipped
pony
that
looks
like
a
velocipede
under
him
his
companion
watchorn
is
very
great
and
hardly
condescends
to
know
the
country

who
claim
his
acquaintance
as
a

he
is
a

and
taking
all
the
odds
he
can
get

in

watchorn
knows
that
it
is
easier
to

astride

meanwhile
the
old
fiddler
regardless
of
the
shouts
of
the
men
and
the
shrieks
of
the
ladies
scrapes
away
with
the
appropriate
tune
of
devil
among
the
tailors
a
rush
to
the
horses
heads
arrests
further
mischief
the
dislodged
captains
are
at
length
righted
the
nerves
of
the
ladies
composed
and
sir
harry
once
more
essays
to
drive
them
up
the
hill
to
the
stand
that
feat
being
accomplished
then
came
the
unloading
and
consternation
and
huddling
of
the
occupants
at
the
idea
of
these
female
coming
amongst
them
and
the
usual
peeping
and
spying
and
eyeing
of
the
impudence
i
think
my
word
next
exclamations
that
were
pretty
well
lost
upon
the
fair
objects
of
them
amid
the
noise
and
flutter
and
confusion
of
the
scene
but
hark
again
what
up
now
illustration
cheers
for
the

old
puff
as
we
live
the
instance
of
a
greeted
by
the
swillingford
snobs
the
old
dandy
is
flattered
by
the
cheers
and
bows
condescendingly
ere
he
alights
from
the
mail
phaeton
see
how
graciously
the
ladies
receive
him
as
having
ascended
the
stairs
he
appears
among
them
man
is
never
too
old
to
marry
is
their
maxim
the
cry
is
still
come
they
come
see
at
a
with
his
bay
pony
in
a
white
lather
rides
pacey
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
with
his
peeping
out
of
the
breast
pocket
of
his
brown
cutaway
he
is
staring
and
gaping
to
see
who
is
looking
at
him
pacey
has
made
such
a
book
as
none
but
a
boy
like
himself
could
make
he
has
been
surfeited
with
tips
peeping
tom
had
advised
him
to
back
daddy
longlegs
and
sneaking
joe
has
counselled
him
that
the
will
be
without
cholera
and
gold
without
danger
while
jemmy
something
the
jockey
who
advertises
that
his
is
not
for
falsehood
framed
though
we
should
think
it
was
framed
for
nothing
else
has
urged
him
to
back
parvo
to
half
the
amount
of
the
national
debt
altogether
pacey
has
made
such
a
mess
that
he
can
not
possibly
win
and
may
lose
almost
any
sum
from
a
thousand
pounds
down
to
a
hundred
and
eighty
sponge
has
got
well
on
with
him
through
the
medium
of
jack
spraggon
pacey
is
now
going
to
what
he
calls
see
that
he
has
got
his
bets
booked
right
and
throwing
his
right
leg
over
his
cob
neck
he
blobs
on
to
the
ground
and
leaving
the
pony
to
take
care
of
itself
disappears
in
the
crowd
what
a
hubbub
what
roarings
and
shoutings
and
recognizings
my
heart
who
have
thought
of
seeing
you
and
jingo
what
sent
here
dear
waffles

jawleyford
rushing
up
to
our
laverick

friend
who
is
looking
very
debauched
overjoyed
to
see
you
do
come
upstairs
and
see
jawleyford
and
the
dear

it
was
only
last
night
we
were
talking
about

so
jawleyford
hurries

off
just
as

about
his
horse
looking
around
the

there
seems
to
be
everybody

we
have
had
the
pleasure
of
introducing

the

in
the
course
of

in
the
ugly

running
down
with
perspiration
having
run
over

with

come
to
look
after
that
which
we

hark
there
a
row
below
the
stand
and
viney
is
seen
in
a
state
of
excitement
inquiring
for
washball
pacey
has
objected
to
a
gentleman
rider
and
guano
and
puffington
have
differed
on
the
point
a
nice
slim
lad
buckram
rough
rider
has
come
to
the
scales
and
claimed
to
be
allowed
lb
as
the
honourable
captain
boville
finding
the
point
questioned
he
abandons
the
and
sinks
into
plain
captain
boville
pacey
now
objects
to
him
altogether
me
sir
me
sir
simpers
our
friend
dick
bragg
sidling
up
to
the
objector
with
a
sort
of
tendency
of
his
hand
to
his
hat
me
sir
me
repeats
he
i
think
you
was
wrong
sir
in
objecting
to
captain
boville
sir
as
a
rider
sir
demands
pacey
in
the
full
flush
of
victory
sir
because
sir
in
fact
sir
he
a
sir
a
gentleman
how
do
know
demands
pacey
in
the
same
tone
as
before
sir
he
a
an
undoubted
everything
about
him
shows
that
does
nothing
breeches
by
anderson
boots
by
bartley
besides
which
he
drinks
wine
every
day
and
has
a
whole
box
of
cigars
in
his
bedroom
but
do
take
my
word
for
it
pray
continued
bragg
seeing
pacey
was
wavering
take
my
word
for
it
pray
there
a
a
countryman
of
his
somewhere
about
added
he
looking
anxiously
into
the
surrounding
crowd
there
a
a
countryman
of
his
somewhere
about
if
we
could
but
find
him
bragg
standing
on
his
tiptoes
and
exclaiming
buckram
buckram
has
anybody
seen
anything
of
mr
buckram
replied
a
meek
voice
from
behind
upon
which
there
was
an
elbowing
through
the
crowd
and
presently
a
most
respectable
man
attired
in
a
new
brown
cutaway
with
bright
buttons
and
a
velvet
collar
with
a
buff
waistcoat
came
twirling
an
in
one
hand
and
fumbling
the
silver
in
his
drab
trousers
pocket
with
the
other
in
front
of
the
bystanders
he
is
exclaimed
bragg
appealing
to
the
stranger
with
a
hasty
know
captain
boville
do
you
now
as
to
the
matter
of
that
replied
the
gentleman
gathering
all
the
loose
silver
up
into
his
hand
and
speaking
very
slowly
just
as
a
country
gentleman
who
has
all
the
day
to
do
nothing
in
may
be
supposed
to
speak
why
now
as
to
the
matter
of
that
said
he
eyeing
pacey
intently
and
beginning
to
drop
the
silver
slowly
as
he
spoke
ca
say
that
i
any
very
with
the
captin
i
knows
him
in
course
just
as
one
knows
a
neighbour
son
the
captin
a
good
deal
younger
nor
me
continued
he
raising
his
new
parisian
as
if
to
show
his
sandy
grey
hair
sixty
and
he
i
dare
say
is
little
more
nor
twenty
dropping
a
as
he
said
it
the
captin
a
nice
young
gent
a
nice
young
gent
without
any
blandishment
i
should
say
and
that
more
nor
one
can
say
of
all
young
gents
nowadays
said
buckram
looking
at
pacey
as
he
spoke
and
dropping
two
consecutive
but
you
live
near
him
do
you
interrupted
bragg
him
repeated
buckram
feeling
his
chin
thoughtfully
yes
that
to
say
near
his
dad
the
fact
is
continued
he
a
little
independence
of
my
own
dropping
a
heavy
piece
as
he
said
it
and
his
father
old
bo
as
i
call
him
adjoins
me
and
if
either
of
us
to
have
a
or
a
of
wenzun
and
a
few
friends
we
inwite
each
other
and
wicey
wersey
you
know
letting
off
a
lot
of
shillings
and
sixpences
and
just
at
the
moment
the
blind
fiddler
struck
up
devil
among
the
tailors
when
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
mob
closed
the
scene
and
now
gentlemen
who
heretofore
have
shown
no
more
of
the
jockey
than
cinderella
feet
in
the
early
part
of
the
pantomime
disclose
of
her
ball
attire
suddenly
cast
off
the
and
bearskin
wraps
and
shawls
and
overcoats
of
winter
and
shine
forth
in
all
the
silken
flutter
of
summer
heat
we
know
of
no
more
humiliating
sight
than
misshapen
gentlemen
playing
at
jockeys
playing
at
soldiers
is
bad
enough
but
playing
at
jockeys
is
infinitely
worse
above
all
playing
at
jockeys
combining
as
they
generally
do
all
the
worst
features
of
the
and
racecourse
unsympathizing
boots
and
breeches
dirty
jackets
that
never
fit
and
caps
that
wo
keep
on
what
a
farce
to
see
the
great
bulky
fellows
go
to
scale
with
their
saddles
strapped
to
their
backs
as
if
to
illustrate
the
impossibility
of
putting
a
round
of
beef
upon
a
pudding
plate
but
the
ones
are
mounting
see
there
jack
spraggon
getting
a
hoist
on
to
daddy
longlegs
did
ever
mortal
see
such
a
man
for
a
jockey
he
has
cut
off
the
laps
of
a
stunner
tartan
jacket
and
looks
like
a
great
he
has
got
his
head
into
an
old
military
which
comes
down
almost
on
to
the
rims
of
his
great
spectacles
lord
scamperdale
stands
with
his
hand
on
the
horse
mane
talking
earnestly
to
jack
doubtless
giving
him
his
final
instructions
other
jockeys
emerge
from
various
parts
of
the
some
out
of
stables
some
out
of
others
from
beneath
the
scene
becomes
enlivened
with
the
varied
colours
of
the
riders
red
yellow
green
blue
violet
and
stripes
without
end
then
comes
the
usual
difficulty
of
identifying
the
parties
many
of
whose
mothers
would
know
them
captain
tongs
observes
miss
simperley
the
blue
i
remember
dancing
with
him
at
bath
and
he
did
nothing
but
talk
about
who
that
in
yellow
asks
miss
hardy
captain
gander
replies
the
gentleman
on
her
left
i
think
he
win
replies
the
lady
bet
you
a
pair
of
gloves
he
does

miss

who
fancies

in
the

a
squat
little
jockey
exclaims
miss
hamilton
as
a
little
dumpling
of
a
man
in
lincoln
green
is
led
past
the
stand
on
a
fine
bay
horse
some
one
recognizing
the
rider
as
our
old
friend
caingey
thornton
look
who
comes
here
whispers
miss
jawleyford
to
her
sister
as
sponge
having
accomplished
a
mount
without
derangement
of
temper
rides
hercules
quietly
past
the
stand
his
resting
on
his
thigh
and
his
head
turned
to
his
fair
companion
on
the
white
the
wretch
sneers
miss
amelia
and
the
fair
sisters
look
at
lucy
and
then
at
him
with
the
utmost
disgust
sponge
may
now
be
doubled
up
by
half
a
dozen
falls
ere
either
of
them
would
suggest
the
propriety
of
having
him
bled
lucy
cheeks
are
rather
blanched
with
the
cast
of
thought
for
she
is
not
sufficiently
initiated
in
the
mysteries
of
to
know
that
it
is
often
quite
as
good
for
a
man
to
lose
as
to
win
which
it
had
just
been
quietly
arranged
between
sponge
and
buckram
should
be
the
case
on
this
occasion
buckram
having
got
uncommonly
on
to
the
losing
tune
perhaps
however
lucy
was
thinking
of
the
peril
not
the
profit
of
the
thing
the
young
ladies
on
the
stand
eye
her
with
mingled
feelings
of
pity
and
disdain
while
the
elderly
ones
shake
their
heads
call
her
a
bold
hussy
declare
she
not
so
pretty
adding
that
they
have
come
if
they
known
but
it
is
two
an
hour
and
a
half
after
time
and
there
is
at
last
a
disposition
evinced
by
some
of
the
parties
to
go
to
the
post
jockeys
are
seen
converging
that
way
and
the
close
in
getting
more
and
more
clamorous
for
odds
what
a
hubbub
how
they
bellow
how
they
roar
a
universal
deafness
seems
to
have
come
over
the
whole
of
them
to
one
the
screams
one
take
eight
roars
another
to
one
agen
cries
a
third
roars
a
fourth
over
rejoins
the
other
replies
the
taker
take
five
to
one
agin
the
daddy
lay
six
any
one
lay
parvo
and
so
they
raise
such
an
uproar
that
the
squeak
squeak
squeak
of
the
among
the
is
hardly
heard
then
in
a
partial
lull
the
voice
of
lord
scamperdale
rises
exclaiming
you
hideous
hobgoblin
of
a
boy
you
think
because
a
lord
and
ca
swear
or
use
coarse
language
and
again
the
hubbub
led
on
by
the
among
the
tailors
drowns
the
exclamations
of
the
speaker
it
that
pacey
again
accusing
the
virtuous
spraggon
of
handing
his
extra
weight
to
lord
scamperdale
and
jack
in
the
full
consciousness
of
injured
guilt
intimates
that
the
blood
of
the
spraggons
wo
stand
that
that
way
of
settling
it
and
he
be
ready
for
pacey
half
an
hour
after
the
race
at
length
the
horses
are
all
out
one
two

ten
eleven
twelve
thirteen
fourteen
fifteen
fifteen
of

moving
about
in
all
directions
some
taking
an
others
a
down
some
a
spicy
trot
others
walking
to
and
fro
while
one
has
still
his
muzzle
on
lest
he
should
unship
his
rider
and
eat
him
and
another
groom
follows
imploring
the
mob
to
keep
off
his
heels
if
they
do
want
their
heads
in
their
hands
the
noisy
bell
at
length
summons
the
scattered
forces
to
the
post
and
the
variegated
riders
form
into
as
good
a
line
as
circumstances
will
allow
just
as
sponge
turns
his
horse
head
lucy
hands
him
her
little
silver
which
our
friend
drains
to
the
dregs
as
he
returns
it
with
a
warm
pressure
of
her
soft
hand
a
flood
of
tears
burst
their
bounds
and
suffuse
her
lustrous
eyes
she
turns
away
to
hide
her
emotion
at
the
same
instant
a
wild
shout
rends
the
air
they
off
thirteen
get
away
one
turns
tail
and
our
friend
in
the
lincoln
green
is
left
performing
a
asking
the
rearing
horse
with
an
oath
if
he
thinks
stole
him
while
the
mob
shout
and
roar
and
one
wicked
wag
in
coaching
parlance
advises
him
to
pay
the
difference
and
get
inside
but
what
a
display
of
horsemanship
is
exhibited
by
the
flyers
tongs
comes
off
at
the
first
fence
the
horse
making
straight
for
a
pond
while
the
rest
rattle
on
in
a
mass
the
second
fence
is
small
but
there
a
ditch
on
the
far
side
and
pusher
and
gander
severally
measure
their
lengths
on
the
rushy
pasture
beyond
still
there
are
ten
left
and
nobody
ever
reckoned
upon
these
getting
to
the
far
end
wins
for
a
exclaims
leather
as
getting
into
the
third
field
sponge
takes
a
decided
lead
and
lucy
encouraged
by
the
sound
looks
up
and
sees
her
jacket
throwing
the
dry
fallow
in
the
faces
of
the
field
how
i
hope
he
will
exclaims
she
clasping
her
hands
with
upturned
eyes
but
when
she
ventures
on
another
look
she
sees
old
spraggon
drawing
upon
him
hangallows
flaming
red
jacket
not
far
off
and
several
others
nearer
than
she
liked
still
the
tail
was
beginning
to
form
another
fence
and
that
a
big
one
draws
it
out
a
striped
jacket
is
down
and
the
horse
after
a
vain
effort
to
rise
sinks
lifeless
on
the
ground
on
they
go
all
the
same
loud
yells
of
exciting
betting
burst
from
the
spectators
and
buckram
gets
well
on
for
the
cross
there
are
now
five
in
front
sponge
spraggon
hangallows
boville
and
another
and
already
the
pace
begins
to
tell
it
was
possible
to
run
it
at
the
rate
they
started
spraggon
makes
a
desperate
effort
to
get
the
lead
and
sponge
seeing
boville
handy
pulls
his
horse
and
lets
the
make
play
over
a
rough
heavy
fallow
with
the
chestnut
jack
spurs
and
flogs
and
grins
and
foams
at
the
mouth
thus
they
get
half
round
the

at

was
most
overpowering
each
found

lucy
sobbed
and

and

and
laughed

and
seemed
as
if
her
little
heart
would
burst
its
bounds
the

ever
open
to
sentiment
especially
the
sentiment
of

cheered

a
tall
shaggyford
rough
taking
off
his
woolly
cap
and
waving
it
shouted
a
group
of
navvies
for

then
roared
a
butcher
who
had
won
as
many
on
the
three
cheers
were
given
for
the
unwilling
winner
my
poor
dear
jack
exclaimed
his
lordship
throwing
himself
off
his
horse
and
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
as
a
select
party
of
who
had
gone
to
jack
assistance
raised
him
up
and
turned
his
ghastly
face
with
his
eyes
squinting
inside
out
and
the
foam
still
on
his
mouth
full
upon
him
my
poor
dear
jack
repeated
his
lordship
sinking
on
his
knees
beside
him
and
grasping
his
stiffening
hand
as
he
spoke
his
lordship
sank
overpowered
upon
the
body
the
then
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
ease
his
lordship
and
jack
of
their
watches
and
the
few
shillings
they
had
about
them
and
departed
when
a
lord
is
in
distress
consolation
is
never
long
in
coming
and
lord
scamperdale
had
hardly
got
over
the
first
paroxysms
of
grief
and
gathered
up
jack
cap
and
the
fragments
of
his
spectacles
ere
jawleyford
who
had
noticed
his
abrupt
departure
from
the
stand
and
scurry
across
the
country
arrived
at
the
spot
his
lordship
was
still
in
the
full
agony
of
woe
still
grasping
and
bedewing
jack
cold
hand
with
his
tears
my
dear
jack
oh
my
dear
jawleyford
oh
my
dear
jack
he
as
he
mopped
the
tears
from
his
grizzly
cheeks
with
a
red
cotton
kerchief
my
dear
jack
oh
my
dear
jawleyford
oh
my
dear
jack
he
as
a
fresh
flood
spread
the
rugged
surface
what
a
what
a
tr
tr
trump
he
was
shall
never
get
such
another
nobody
could

as
he
could
no
hu
hu
humbug
him
never
was
su
su
such
a
fine
natural
bl
bl
blackguard
and
then
his
feelings
wholly
choked
his
utterance
as
he
recollected
how
easily
jack
was
satisfied
how
he
could
dine
off
tripe
and
mop
up
fat
porridge
for
breakfast
and
never
grumbled
at
being
put
on
a
bad
horse
the
news
of
a
man
being
killed
soon
reached
the
hill
and
drew
the
attention
of
the
mob
from
our
hero
and
heroine
causing
such
a
spread
of
population
over
the
farm
as
must
have
been
highly
gratifying
to
scourgefield
who
stood
watching
the
crashing
of
the
fences
and
the
demolition
of
the
gates
thinking
how
he
was
paying
his
landlord
off
seeing
the
rude
unmannerly
character
of
the
mob
jawleyford
got
his
lordship
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
towards
the
hill
his
lordship
reeling
rather
than
walking
and
indulging
in
all
sorts
of
wild
incoherent
cries
and
lamentations
out
jack
sing
out
he
would
exclaim
as
if
in
the
agony
of
having
his
hounds
ridden
over
then
checking
himself
he
would
shake
his
head
and
say
poor
jack
poor
jack
shall
never
look
upon
his
like
again
shall
never
get
such
a
man
to
read
the
riot
act
and
keep
all
square
and
then
a
fresh
gush
of
tears
suffused
his
grizzly
face
the
minor
casualties
of
those
few
butchering
spasmodic
moments
may
be
briefly
dismissed
though
they
were
more
numerous
than
most
sportsmen
see
out
hunting
in
a
lifetime
one
horse
broke
his
back
another
was
drowned
was
cut
all
to
pieces
his
rider
had
two
ribs
and
a
thumb
broken
while
farmer
slyfield
stackyard
was
fired
by
some
of
the
itinerant
tribe
and
all
its
uninsured
contents
destroyed
so
that
his
landlord
was
not
the
only
person
who
suffered
by
the
grand
occasion
nor
was
this
all
for
numboy
the
coroner
hearing
of
jack
death
held
an
inquest
on
the
body
and
having
empanelled
a
jury
men
who
did
not
see
the
advantage
of
either
in
a
political
commercial
agricultural
or
national
point
of
view
and
who
having
surveyed
the
line
and
found
nearly
every
fence
dangerous
and
the
wall
and
brook
doubly
so
returned
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
against
viney
for
setting
it
out
who
was
forthwith
committed
to
the
county
gaol
of
limbo
castle
for
trial
at
the
ensuing
assizes
from
whence
let
us
join
the
benevolent
clerk
of
arraigns
in
wishing
him
a
good
deliverance
many
of
the
hardy
sounded
the
loud
trump
of
victory
proclaiming
that
their
innumerable
friends
had
feathered
their
nests
through
their
agency
but
peeping
tom
and
infallible
joe
and

wriggle
offending
soul
c
found
it
convenient
to
bolt
from
their
respective
establishments
carrying
with
them
their
large
and
boards
for
posting
up
their
lists
and
setting
up
in
new
names
in
other
quarters
while
the
hen
angel
was
shortly
afterwards
closed
and
the
made
into
soup
so
much
for
the
deer

will
now
devote
a
concluding
chapter
to
the
guns
of
our
story
chapter
lxx
how
lord
scamperdale
and
co
came
off
our
noble
master
nerves
were
so
dreadfully
shattered
by
the
lamentable
catastrophe
to
poor
jack
that
he
stepped
or
rather
was
pushed
into
jawleyford
carriage
almost
insensibly
and
driven
from
the
course
to
jawleyford
court
there
he
remained
sufficiently
long
for
jawleyford
to
persuade
him
that
he
would
be
far
better
married
and
that
either
of
her
amiable
daughters
would
make
him
a
most
excellent
wife
his
lordship
after
very
mature
consideration
and
many
most
scrutinizing
stares
at
both
of
them
through
his
formidable
spectacles
wondering
which
would
be
the
least
likely
to
ruin
him
at
length
decided
upon
taking
miss
emily
the
youngest
though
for
a
long
time
the
victory
was
doubtful
and
amelia
practised
her
singing
with
unabated
ardour
and
confidence
up
to
the
last
we
believe
if
the
truth
were
known
it
was
a
slight
touch
of
rouge
that
amelia
thought
would
clench
the
matter
that
decided
his
lordship
against
her
emily
we
are
happy
to
say
makes
him
an
excellent
wife
and
has
not
got
her
head
turned
by
becoming
a
countess
she
has
improved
his
lordship
amazingly
got
him
smart
new
clothes
and
persuaded
him
to
grow
bushy
whiskers
right
down
under
his
chin
and
is
now
feeling
her
way
to
a
pair
of
moustaches
woodmansterne
is
quite
another
place
she
has
marshalled
a
proper
establishment
and
got
him
coaxed
into
the
long
company
rooms
though
he
still
indulges
in
his
former
and
other
delicacies
they
do
not
appear
upon
table
while
he
sports
his
specs
on
all
occasions
the
fruit
and
venison
are
freely
distributed
and
we
have
come
in
for
a
haunch
in
return
for
our
attentions
best
of
all
lady
scamperdale
has
got
his
lordship
to
erect
a
handsome
marble
monument
to
poor
jack
instead
of
the
cheap
country
stone
he
intended
the
inscription
states
that
it
was
erected
by
samuel
eighth
earl
of
scamperdale
and
viscount
hardup
in
the
peerage
of
ireland
to
the
memory
of
john
spraggon
esquire
the
best
of
sportsmen
and
the
firmest
of
friends
who
or
what
jack
was
nobody
ever
knew
and
as
he
only
left
a
hat
and
eighteen
pence
behind
him
no
next
of
kin
has
as
yet
cast
up
jawleyford
has
not
stood
the
honour
of
the
scamperdale
alliance
quite
so
well
as
his
daughter
and
when
our
instance
of
a
man
instigated
perhaps
by
the
desire
to
have
old
scamp
for
a
offered
to
amelia
jaw
got
throaty
and
consequential
hemmed
and
hawed
and
pretended
to
be
stiff
about
it
puff
however
produced
such
weighty
testimonials
as
soon
exercised
their
wonted
influence
in
due
time
puff
very
magnanimously
proposed
uniting
his
pack
with
lord
scamperdale
dividing
the
expense
of
one
establishment
between
them
to
which
his
lordship
readily
assented
advising
puff
to
get
rid
of
bragg
by
giving
him
the
hounds
which
he
did
and
that
great
sporting
luminary
may
be
seen
himself
and
offering
his
service
to
masters
of
hounds
any
monday
at
tattersall
though
he
still
prefers
a
place
benjamin
buckram
the
gentleman
with
the
small
independence
of
his
own
we
are
sorry
to
say
has
gone
to
the
aggravated
by
the
loss
he
sustained
by
his
horse
winning
the
he
made
an
onslaught
on
the
of
the
london
and
westminster
bank
and
at
three
score
years
and
ten
this
distinguished
who
had
participated
with
impunity
in
nearly
all
the
great
robberies
of
the
last
forty
years
was
doomed
to
transportation
and
yet
we
have
seen
this
cracksman
captain
for
he
too
was
a
captain
at
times
jostling
and
bellowing
for
odds
among
some
of
the
highest
and
noblest
of
the
land
leather
has
descended
to
the
of
which
he
promises
to
be
a
distinguished
ornament
he
haunts
the
piccadilly
stands
and
has
what
he
calls
a
raw
on
sponge
to
the
extent
of
a
week
under
threats
of
exposing
the
robbery
sponge
committed
on
our
friend
waffles
that
volatile
genius
we
are
happy
to
add
is
quite
well
and
open
to
the
attentions
of
any
young
lady
who
thinks
she
can
tame
a
wild
young
man
his
financial
affairs
are
not
irretrievable
and
now
for
the
hero
and
heroine
of
our
tale
the
sponges
for
our
friend
married
lucy
shortly
after
the
stayed
at
nonsuch
house
until
the
bailiffs
walked
in
sir
harry
then
bolted
to
boulogne
where
he
shortly
afterwards
died
and
bugles
very
properly
married
my
lady
they
are
now
living
at
wandsworth
bugles
and
lady
scattercash
very
thought
of
as
bugles
says
although
sponge
did
not
gain
as
much
by
winning
the
as
he
would
have
done
had
hercules
allowed
him
to
lose
it
he
still
did
pretty
well
and
being
at
length
starved
out
of
nonsuch
house
he
arrived
at
his
old
quarters
the
bantam
in
bond
street
where
he
turned
his
attention
very
seriously
to
providing
for
lucy
and
the
little
sponge
who
had
now
issued
its
prospectus
he
thought
over
all
the
ways
and
means
of
making
money
without
capital
rejecting
australia
and
california
as
unfit
for
sportsmen
and
men
fond
of
their
professional
lucy
decried
declaring
she
would
rather
return
to
her
at
astley
as
soon
as
she
was
able
than
have
her
dear
sponge
risking
his
neck
that
way
our
friend
at
length
began
to
fear
was
not
so
easy
as
he
thought
indeed
he
was
soon
sure
of
it
one
day
as
he
was
staring
vacantly
out
of
the
bantam
window
between
the
gilt
labels
soups
and
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
fit
of
virtuous
indignation
at
the
disreputable
frauds
practised
by
unprincipled
adventurers
on
the
unwary
public
in
the
way
of
betting
offices
and
resolved
that
he
would
be
the
george
to
slay
this
great
dragon
of
abuse
accordingly
after
due
consultation
with
lucy
he
invested
his
all
in
fitting
up
and
decorating
the
splendid
establishment
in
jermyn
street
james
now
known
as
the
sponge
and
cigar
betting
rooms
whose
richness
neither
pen
nor
pencil
can
do
justice
to
we
must
therefore
entreat
our
readers
to
visit
this
emporium
of
honesty
where
in
addition
to
finding
lists
posted
on
all
the
great
events
of
the
day
they
can
have
the
use
of
a
while
they
indulge
in
one
of
unrivalled
cigars
and
noblemen
gentlemen
and
officers
in
the
household
troops
may
be
accommodated
with
loans
on
their
personal
security
to
any
amount
we
see
by
sponge
last
advertisements
that
he
has
to
lend
at
three
and
a
half
per
a
farce
we
fancy
we
hear
some
enterprising
youngster
exclaim
a
farce
to
suppose
that
such
a
needy
scamp
as
sponge
who
has
been
cheating
everybody
has
any
money
to
lend
or
to
pay
bets
with
if
he
loses
right
young
gentleman
right
but
not
a
bit
greater
farce
than
to
suppose
that
any
of
the
plausible
or
infallible
with
whom
you
perhaps
have
had
connection
have
any
either
in
case
it
called
for
nay
bad
as
he
is
we
back
old
soapey
to
be
better
than
any
of
them
with
which
encomium
we
most
heartily
bid
him
