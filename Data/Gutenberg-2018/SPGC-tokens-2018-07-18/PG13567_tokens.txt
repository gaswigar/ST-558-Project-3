i
the
landlord
the
lady
and
charles
wogan
were
all
three
it
seemed
in
luck
way
that
september
morning
of
the
year
wogan
was
not
surprised
his
luck
for
the
moment
was
altogether
in
so
that
even
when
his
horse
stumbled
and
went
lame
at
a
desolate
part
of
the
road
from
florence
to
bologna
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
somehow
fortune
would
serve
him
his
horse
stepped
gingerly
on
for
a
few
yards
stopped
and
looked
round
at
his
master
wogan
and
his
horse
were
on
the
best
of
terms
is
it
so
bad
as
that
said
he
and
dismounting
he
gently
felt
the
strained
leg
then
he
took
the
bridle
in
his
hand
and
walked
forward
whistling
as
he
walked
yet
the
place
and
the
hour
were
most
unlikely
to
give
him
succour
it
was
early
morning
and
he
walked
across
an
empty
basin
of
the
hills
the
sun
was
not
visible
though
the
upper
air
was
golden
and
the
green
peaks
of
the
hills
rosy
the
basin
itself
was
filled
with
a
broad
uncoloured
light
and
lay
naked
to
it
and
extraordinarily
still
there
were
as
yet
no
shadows
the
road
rose
and
dipped
across
low
ridges
of
turf
a
ribbon
of
dead
and
unillumined
white
and
the
grass
at
any
distance
from
the
road
had
the
darkness
of
peat
he
led
his
horse
forward
for
perhaps
a
mile
and
then
turning
a
corner
by
a
knot
of
trees
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
wayside
inn
in
front
of
the
inn
stood
a
travelling
carriage
with
its
team
of
horses
the
backs
of
the
horses
smoked
and
the
candles
of
the
lamps
were
still
burning
in
the
broad
daylight
wogan
quickened
his
pace
he
would
beg
a
seat
on
the
box
to
the
next
posting
stage
fortune
had
served
him
as
he
came
near
he
heard
from
the
interior
of
the
inn
a
woman
voice
not
unmusical
so
much
as
shrill
with
impatience
which
perpetually
ordered
and
protested
as
he
came
nearer
he
heard
a
man
voice
obsequiously
answering
the
protests
and
as
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
rang
in
front
of
the
inn
both
voices
immediately
stopped
the
door
was
flung
hastily
open
and
the
landlord
and
the
lady
ran
out
onto
the
road
sir
said
the
lady
in
italian
i
need
a
postillion
to
wogan
thinking
she
needed
much
more
than
a
postillion
she
needed
certainly
a
retinue
of
servants
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
she
did
not
need
a
nurse
for
she
was
a
creature
of
an
exquisite
fragility
with
the
pouting
face
of
a
child
and
the
childishness
was
exaggerated
by
a
great
muslin
bow
she
wore
at
her
throat
her
pale
hair
where
it
showed
beneath
her
hood
was
fine
as
silk
and
as
glossy
her
eyes
had
the
colour
of
an
italian
sky
at
noon
and
her
cheeks
the
delicate
tinge
of
a
carnation
the
many
laces
and
ribbons
knotted
about
her
dress
in
a
manner
most
mysterious
to
wogan
added
to
her
gossamer
appearance
and
in
a
word
she
seemed
to
him
something
too
flowerlike
for
the
rough
usage
i
must
have
a
postillion
she
continued
presently
madam
said
the
landlord
smiling
with
all
a
tuscan
peasant
desire
to
please
in
a
minute
in
less
than
a
minute
he
looked
complacently
about
him
as
though
at
any
moment
now
a
crop
of
postillions
might
be
expected
to
flower
by
the
roadside
the
lady
turned
from
him
with
a
stamp
of
the
foot
and
saw
that
wogan
was
curiously
regarding
her
carriage
a
boy
stood
at
the
horses
heads
but
his
dress
and
sleepy
face
showed
that
he
had
not
been
half
an
hour
out
of
bed
and
there
was
no
one
else
wogan
was
wondering
how
in
the
world
she
had
travelled
as
far
as
this
inn
the
lady
explained
the
postillion
who
drove
me
from
florence
was
drunk
oh
but
drunk
he
rolled
off
his
horse
just
here
opposite
the
door
see
i
beat
him
and
she
raised
the
beribboned
handle
of
a
cane
but
it
was
no
use
i
broke
my
cane
over
his
back
but
he
would
not
get
up
he
crawled
into
the
passage
where
he
lies
wogan
had
some
ado
not
to
smile
neither
the
cane
nor
the
hand
which
wielded
it
would
be
likely
to
interfere
even
with
a
sober
slumbers
and
i
must
reach
bologna
she
cried
in
an
extreme
agitation
it
is
of
the
last
importance
fortune
is
kind
to
us
both
madam
said
wogan
with
a
bow
my
horse
is
lamed
as
you
see
i
will
be
your
charioteer
for
i
too
am
in
a
desperate
hurry
to
reach
bologna
immediately
the
lady
drew
back
oh
she
said
with
a
start
looking
at
wogan
wogan
looked
at
her
ah
said
he
thoughtfully
they
eyed
each
other
for
a
moment
each
silently
speculating
what
the
other
was
doing
alone
at
this
hour
and
in
such
a
haste
to
reach
bologna
you
are
english
she
said
with
a
great
deal
of
unconcern
and
she
asked
in
english
that
was
english
wogan
already
knew
from
her
accent
his
italian
however
was
more
than
passable
and
he
was
a
wary
man
by
nature
as
well
as
by
some
ten
years
training
in
a
service
where
wariness
was
the
first
need
though
it
was
seldom
acquired
he
could
have
answered
no
quite
truthfully
being
irish
he
preferred
to
answer
her
in
italian
as
though
he
had
not
understood
i
beg
your
pardon
yes
i
will
drive
you
to
bologna
if
the
landlord
will
swear
to
look
after
my
horse
and
he
was
very
precise
in
his
directions
the
landlord
swore
very
readily
his
anxiety
to
be
rid
of
his
vociferous
guest
and
to
get
back
to
bed
was
extreme
wogan
climbed
into
the
postillion
saddle
describing
the
while
such
remedies
as
he
desired
to
be
applied
to
the
sprained
leg
the
horse
is
a
favourite
asked
the
lady
madam
said
wogan
with
a
laugh
i
would
not
lose
that
horse
for
all
the
world
for
the
woman
i
shall
marry
will
ride
on
it
into
my
city
of
dreams
the
lady
stared
as
she
well
might
she
hesitated
with
her
foot
upon
the
step
is
he
sober
she
asked
of
the
landlord
madam
said
the
landlord
unabashed
in
this
district
he
is
nicknamed
the
water
drinker
you
know
him
then
he
is
italian
he
is
more
he
is
of
tuscany
the
landlord
had
never
seen
wogan
in
his
life
before
but
the
lady
seemed
to
wish
some
assurance
on
the
point
so
he
gave
it
he
shut
the
carriage
door
and
wogan
cracked
his
whip
the
postillion
desires
were
of
a
piece
with
the
lady
they
raced
across
the
valley
and
as
they
climbed
the
slope
beyond
the
sun
came
over
the
crests
one
moment
the
dew
upon
the
grass
was
like
raindrops
the
next
it
shone
like
polished
jewels
the
postillion
shouted
a
welcome
to
the
sun
and
the
lady
proceeded
to
breakfast
in
her
carriage
wogan
had
to
snatch
a
meal
as
best
he
could
while
the
horses
were
changed
at
the
posting
stage
the
lady
would
not
wait
and
wogan
for
his
part
was
used
to
a
light
fare
he
drove
into
bologna
that
afternoon
the
lady
put
her
head
from
the
window
and
called
out
the
name
of
a
street
her
postillion
however
paid
no
heed
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
deaf
he
whipped
up
his
horses
shouted
encouragements
to
them
and
warnings
to
the
pedestrians
on
the
roads
the
carriage
rocked
round
corners
and
bounced
over
the
uneven
stones
wogan
had
clean
forgotten
the
fragility
of
the
traveller
within
he
saw
men
going
busily
about
talking
in
groups
and
standing
alone
and
all
with
consternation
upon
their
faces
the
quiet
streets
were
alive
with
them
something
had
happened
that
day
in
bologna
some
catastrophe
or
news
had
come
that
day
bad
news
wogan
did
not
stop
to
inquire
he
drove
at
a
gallop
straight
to
a
long
white
house
which
fronted
the
street
the
green
latticed
shutters
were
closed
against
the
sun
but
there
were
servants
about
the
doorway
and
in
their
aspect
too
there
was
something
of
disorder
wogan
called
to
one
of
them
jumped
down
from
his
saddle
and
ran
through
the
open
doorway
into
a
great
hall
with
frescoed
walls
all
ruined
by
neglect
at
the
back
of
the
hall
a
marble
staircase
guarded
by
a
pair
of
marble
lions
ran
up
to
a
landing
and
divided
wogan
set
foot
on
the
staircase
and
heard
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
looked
up
a
burly
man
in
the
gay
embroideries
of
a
courtier
was
descending
towards
him
you
cried
the
courtier
already
and
then
laughed
he
was
the
only
man
whom
wogan
had
seen
laugh
since
he
drove
into
bologna
and
he
drew
a
great
breath
of
hope
then
nothing
has
happened
whittington
there
is
no
bad
news
there
is
news
so
bad
my
friend
that
you
might
have
jogged
here
on
a
mule
and
still
have
lost
no
time
your
hurry
is
clean
wasted
answered
whittington
wogan
ran
past
him
up
the
stairs
and
so
left
the
hall
and
the
open
doorway
clear
whittington
looked
now
straight
through
the
doorway
and
saw
the
carriage
and
the
lady
on
the
point
of
stepping
down
onto
the
kerb
his
face
assumed
a
look
of
extreme
surprise
then
he
glanced
up
the
staircase
after
wogan
and
laughed
as
though
the
conjunction
of
the
lady
and
wogan
was
a
rare
piece
of
amusement
wogan
did
not
hear
the
laugh
but
the
lady
did
she
raised
her
head
and
at
the
same
moment
the
courtier
came
across
the
hall
to
meet
her
as
soon
as
he
had
come
close
harry
said
she
and
gave
him
her
hand
he
bent
over
it
and
kissed
it
and
there
was
more
than
courtesy
in
the
warmth
of
the
kiss
but
i
glad
you
come
i
did
not
look
for
you
for
another
week
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
did
not
however
offer
to
help
her
to
alight
this
is
your
lodging
she
asked
no
said
he
the
king
and
the
woman
shrank
suddenly
back
amongst
her
cushions
in
a
moment
however
her
face
was
again
at
the
door
then
who
was
he
my
postillion
your
postillion
asked
whittington
glancing
at
the
servant
who
held
the
horses
yes
the
tall
man
who
looked
as
if
he
should
have
been
a
scholar
and
had
twisted
himself
all
awry
into
a
soldier
you
must
have
passed
him
in
the
hall
whittington
stared
at
her
then
he
burst
again
into
a
laugh
your
postillion
was
he
that
the
oddest
thing
and
he
lowered
his
voice
your
postillion
was
charles
wogan
who
comes
from
rome
with
the
pope
procuration
for
the
marriage
you
have
helped
him
on
his
way
it
seems
here
a
good
beginning
to
be
sure
the
lady
uttered
a
little
cry
of
anger
and
her
face
hardened
out
of
all
its
softness
she
clenched
her
fists
viciously
and
her
blue
eyes
grew
cold
and
dangerous
as
steel
at
this
moment
she
hardly
looked
the
delicate
flower
she
had
appeared
to
wogan
fancy
but
you
need
not
blame
yourself
said
whittington
and
he
lowered
his
head
to
a
level
with
hers
all
the
procurations
in
christendom
will
not
marry
james
stuart
to
clementina
sobieski
she
has
not
come
then
no
nor
will
she
come
there
is
news
lean
back
from
the
window
and
i
will
tell
you
she
has
been
arrested
at
innspruck
the
lady
could
not
repress
a
crow
of
delight
hush
said
whittington
then
he
withdrew
his
head
and
resumed
in
his
ordinary
voice
i
have
hired
a
house
for
your
ladyship
which
i
trust
will
be
found
convenient
my
servant
will
drive
you
thither
he
summoned
his
servant
from
the
group
of
footmen
about
the
entrance
gave
him
his
orders
bowed
to
the
ground
and
twisting
his
cane
sauntered
idly
down
the
street
chapter
ii
wogan
mounted
the
stairs
not
daring
to
speculate
upon
the
nature
of
the
bad
news
but
his
face
was
pale
beneath
its
sunburn
and
his
hand
trembled
on
the
balustrade
for
he
knew
in
his
heart
he
knew
there
could
be
only
one
piece
of
news
which
would
make
his
haste
or
tardiness
matters
of
no
account
both
branches
of
the
stairs
ran
up
to
a
common
landing
and
in
the
wall
facing
him
midway
between
the
two
stairheads
was
a
great
door
of
tulip
wood
an
usher
stood
by
the
door
and
at
wogan
approach
opened
it
wogan
however
signed
to
him
to
be
silent
he
wished
to
hear
not
to
speak
and
so
he
slipped
into
the
room
unannounced
the
door
was
closed
silently
behind
him
and
at
once
he
was
surprised
by
the
remarkable
silence
almost
a
cessation
of
life
it
seemed
in
a
room
which
was
quite
full
wherever
the
broad
bars
of
sunshine
fell
as
they
slanted
dusty
with
motes
through
the
open
lattices
of
the
shutters
they
striped
a
woman
dress
or
a
man
velvet
coat
yet
if
anyone
shuffled
a
foot
or
allowed
a
petticoat
to
rustle
that
person
glanced
on
each
side
guiltily
a
group
of
people
were
gathered
in
front
of
the
doorway
their
backs
were
towards
wogan
and
they
were
looking
towards
the
centre
of
the
room
wogan
raised
himself
on
his
toes
and
looked
that
way
too
having
looked
he
sank
down
again
aware
at
once
that
he
had
travelled
of
late
a
long
way
in
a
little
time
and
that
he
was
intolerably
tired
for
that
one
glance
was
enough
to
deprive
him
of
his
last
possibility
of
doubt
he
had
seen
the
chevalier
de
george
his
king
sitting
apart
in
a
little
open
space
and
over
against
him
a
short
squarish
man
dusty
as
wogan
himself
who
stood
and
sullenly
waited
it
was
sir
john
hay
the
man
who
had
been
sent
to
fetch
the
princess
clementina
privately
to
bologna
and
here
he
now
was
back
at
bologna
and
alone
wogan
had
counted
much
upon
this
marriage
more
indeed
than
any
of
his
comrades
it
was
to
be
the
first
step
of
the
pedestal
in
the
building
up
of
a
throne
it
was
to
establish
in
europe
a
party
for
james
stuart
as
strong
as
the
party
of
hanover
but
so
much
was
known
to
everyone
in
that
room
to
wogan
the
marriage
meant
more
for
even
while
he
found
himself
muttering
over
and
over
with
dry
lips
as
white
and
exhausted
he
leaned
against
the
door
clementina
qualifications
daughter
of
the
king
of
poland
cousin
to
the
emperor
and
to
the
king
of
portugal
niece
to
the
electors
of
treves
bavaria
and
palatine
the
image
of
the
girl
herself
rose
up
before
his
eyes
and
struck
her
titles
from
his
thoughts
she
was
the
chosen
woman
chosen
by
him
out
of
all
europe
and
lost
by
john
hay
he
remembered
very
clearly
at
that
moment
his
first
meeting
with
her
he
had
travelled
from
court
to
court
in
search
of
the
fitting
wife
and
had
come
at
last
to
the
palace
at
ohlau
in
silesia
it
was
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
as
he
was
ushered
into
the
great
stone
hall
hung
about
and
carpeted
with
barbaric
skins
he
had
seen
standing
by
the
blazing
wood
fire
in
the
huge
chimney
a
girl
in
a
riding
dress
she
raised
her
head
and
the
firelight
struck
upwards
on
her
face
adding
a
warmth
to
its
bright
colours
and
a
dancing
light
to
the
depths
of
her
dark
eyes
her
hair
was
drawn
backwards
from
her
forehead
and
the
frank
sweet
face
revealed
to
him
from
the
broad
forehead
to
the
rounded
chin
told
him
that
here
was
one
who
joined
to
a
royal
dignity
the
simple
nature
of
a
peasant
girl
who
works
in
the
fields
and
knows
more
of
animals
than
of
mankind
wogan
was
back
again
in
that
stone
hall
when
the
voice
of
the
chevalier
with
its
strong
french
accent
broke
in
upon
his
vision
well
we
will
hear
the
story
well
you
left
ohlau
with
the
princess
and
her
mother
and
a
train
of
servants
in
spite
of
my
commands
of
secrecy
there
was
more
anger
and
less
despondency
than
was
often
heard
in
his
voice
wogan
raised
himself
again
on
tiptoes
and
noticed
that
the
chevalier
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
bright
with
wrath
sir
pleaded
hay
the
princess
mother
would
not
abate
a
man
well
you
reached
ratisbon
and
there
there
the
english
minister
came
forward
from
the
town
to
flout
us
with
an
address
of
welcome
in
which
he
used
not
our
incognitos
but
our
true
names
from
ratisbon
then
no
doubt
you
hurried
since
you
were
discovered
you
shed
your
retinue
and
hurried
sir
we
hurried
to
augsburg
faltered
hay
he
stopped
and
then
in
a
burst
of
desperation
he
said
at
augsburg
we
stayed
eight
days
eight
days
there
was
a
stir
throughout
the
room
a
murmur
began
and
ceased
wogan
wiped
his
forehead
and
crushed
his
handkerchief
into
a
hard
ball
in
his
palm
it
seemed
to
him
that
here
in
this
room
he
could
see
the
princess
clementina
face
flushed
with
the
humiliation
of
that
loitering
and
why
eight
days
in
augsburg
the
princess
mother
would
have
her
jewels
reset
augsburg
is
famous
for
its
jewellers
stammered
hay
the
murmur
rose
again
it
became
almost
a
cry
of
stupefaction
the
chevalier
sprang
from
his
chair
her
jewels
reset
he
said
he
repeated
the
words
in
bewilderment
her
jewels
reset
then
he
dropped
again
into
his
seat
i
lose
a
wife
gentlemen
and
very
likely
a
kingdom
too
so
that
a
lady
may
have
her
jewels
reset
at
augsburg
where
to
be
sure
there
are
famous
jewellers
his
glance
wandering
in
a
dazed
way
about
the
room
settled
again
on
hay
he
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
in
a
feverish
irritation
and
those
eight
days
gave
just
the
time
for
a
courier
from
the
emperor
at
vienna
to
pass
you
on
the
road
and
not
press
his
horse
one
should
be
glad
of
that
it
would
have
been
a
pity
had
the
courier
killed
his
horse
oh
i
can
fashion
the
rest
of
the
story
for
myself
you
trailed
on
to
innspruck
where
the
governor
marched
out
with
a
troop
and
herded
you
in
they
let
go
however
no
doubt
they
bade
you
hurry
back
to
me
sir
i
did
hurry
said
hay
who
was
now
in
a
pitiable
confusion
i
travelled
hither
without
rest
the
anger
waned
in
the
chevalier
eyes
as
he
heard
the
plea
and
a
great
dejection
crept
over
his
face
yes
you
would
do
that
said
he
that
would
be
the
time
for
you
to
hurry
with
a
pigeon
swiftness
so
that
your
king
might
taste
his
bitter
news
not
a
minute
later
than
need
be
and
what
said
she
upon
her
arrest
the
princess
mother
asked
hay
barely
aware
of
what
he
said
no
her
highness
the
princess
clementina
what
said
she
sir
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
perhaps
the
space
of
a
minute
then
she
leaned
forward
to
the
governor
who
stood
by
her
carriage
and
cried
four
walls
about
me
quick
i
could
sink
into
the
earth
for
shame
wogan
in
those
words
heard
her
voice
as
clearly
as
he
saw
her
face
and
the
dry
lips
between
which
the
voice
passed
he
had
it
in
his
heart
to
cry
aloud
to
send
the
words
ringing
through
that
hushed
room
she
would
have
tramped
here
barefoot
had
she
had
one
guide
with
a
spirit
to
match
hers
for
a
moment
he
almost
fancied
that
he
had
spoken
them
and
that
he
heard
the
echo
of
his
voice
vibrating
down
to
silence
but
he
had
not
and
as
he
realised
that
he
had
not
a
new
thought
occurred
to
him
no
one
had
remarked
his
entrance
into
the
room
the
group
in
front
still
stood
with
their
backs
towards
him
since
his
entrance
no
one
had
remarked
his
presence
at
once
he
turned
and
opened
the
door
so
gently
that
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
click
of
the
latch
he
opened
it
just
wide
enough
for
himself
to
slip
through
and
he
closed
it
behind
him
with
the
same
caution
on
the
landing
there
was
only
the
usher
wogan
looked
over
the
balustrade
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
below
you
can
keep
a
silent
tongue
he
said
to
the
usher
there
profit
in
it
and
wogan
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
you
have
not
seen
me
if
any
ask
sir
said
the
man
any
bright
object
disturbs
my
vision
you
can
see
a
crown
though
said
wogan
through
a
breeches
pocket
but
if
i
held
it
in
my
hand
it
would
dazzle
you
so
much
that
i
should
be
blind
to
the
giver
the
crown
was
offered
and
taken
wogan
went
quietly
down
the
stairs
into
the
hall
there
were
a
few
lackeys
at
the
door
but
they
would
not
concern
themselves
at
all
because
wogan
had
returned
to
bologna
he
looked
carefully
out
into
the
street
chose
a
moment
when
it
was
empty
and
hurried
across
it
he
dived
into
the
first
dark
alley
that
he
came
to
and
following
the
wynds
and
byways
of
the
town
made
his
way
quickly
to
his
lodging
he
had
the
key
to
his
door
in
his
pocket
and
he
now
kept
it
ready
in
his
hand
from
the
shelter
of
a
corner
he
watched
again
till
the
road
was
clear
he
even
examined
the
windows
of
the
neighbouring
houses
lest
somewhere
a
pair
of
eyes
might
happen
to
be
alert
then
he
made
a
run
for
his
door
opened
it
without
noise
and
crept
secretly
as
a
thief
up
the
stairs
to
his
rooms
where
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
his
servant
wogan
had
no
need
to
sign
to
him
to
be
silent
the
man
was
a
veteran
corporal
of
french
guards
who
after
many
seasons
of
campaigning
in
spain
and
the
low
countries
had
now
for
five
years
served
wogan
he
looked
at
his
master
and
without
a
word
went
off
to
make
his
bed
wogan
sat
down
and
went
carefully
over
in
his
mind
every
minute
of
the
time
since
he
had
entered
bologna
no
one
had
noticed
him
when
he
rode
in
as
the
lady
postillion
no
one
he
was
sure
of
that
the
lady
herself
did
not
know
him
from
adam
and
fancied
him
an
italian
into
the
bargain
of
that
too
he
had
no
doubt
the
handful
of
lackeys
at
the
door
of
the
king
house
need
not
be
taken
into
account
they
might
gossip
among
themselves
but
wogan
appearances
and
disappearances
were
so
ordinary
a
matter
even
that
was
unlikely
the
usher
silence
he
had
already
secured
there
was
only
one
acquaintance
who
had
met
and
spoken
with
him
and
that
by
the
best
of
good
fortune
was
harry
whittington
the
idler
who
took
his
banishment
and
his
misfortunes
with
an
equally
light
heart
and
gave
never
a
thought
at
all
to
anything
weightier
than
a
gamecock
wogan
spirits
revived
he
had
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
his
luck
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
short
letter
and
sealed
it
up
marnier
he
called
out
in
a
low
voice
and
his
servant
came
from
the
adjoining
room
take
this
to
edgar
the
king
secretary
as
soon
as
it
grows
dusk
have
a
care
that
no
one
sees
you
deliver
it
lock
the
parlour
door
when
you
go
and
take
the
key
i
am
not
yet
back
from
rome
with
that
wogan
remembered
that
he
had
not
slept
for
hours
within
two
minutes
he
was
between
the
sheets
within
five
he
was
asleep
chapter
iii
wogan
waked
up
in
the
dark
and
was
seized
with
a
fear
that
he
had
slept
too
long
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
pushed
open
the
door
of
his
parlour
there
was
a
lighted
lamp
in
the
room
and
marnier
was
quietly
laying
his
master
supper
at
what
hour
asked
wogan
ten
monsieur
at
the
little
postern
in
the
garden
wall
and
the
time
now
nine
wogan
dressed
with
some
ceremony
supped
and
at
eight
minutes
to
ten
slipped
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
doors
he
had
crushed
his
hat
down
upon
his
forehead
and
he
carried
his
handkerchief
at
his
face
but
the
streets
were
dark
and
few
people
were
abroad
at
a
little
distance
to
his
left
he
saw
above
the
housetops
a
glow
of
light
in
the
air
which
marked
the
wogan
avoided
it
he
kept
again
to
the
alleys
and
emerged
before
the
chevalier
lodging
this
he
passed
but
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
he
turned
down
a
side
street
and
doubled
back
upon
his
steps
along
a
little
byway
between
small
houses
the
line
of
houses
however
at
one
point
was
broken
by
a
garden
wall
under
this
wall
wogan
waited
until
a
clock
struck
ten
and
while
the
clock
was
still
striking
he
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
the
brushing
of
footsteps
amongst
leaves
and
grass
wogan
tapped
gently
on
a
little
door
in
the
wall
it
was
opened
no
less
gently
and
edgar
the
secretary
admitted
him
led
him
across
the
garden
and
up
a
narrow
flight
of
stairs
into
a
small
lighted
cabinet
two
men
were
waiting
in
that
room
one
of
them
wore
the
scarlet
robe
an
old
man
with
white
hair
and
a
broad
bucolic
face
whom
wogan
knew
for
the
pope
legate
cardinal
origo
the
slender
figure
of
the
other
clad
all
in
black
but
for
the
blue
ribbon
of
the
garter
across
his
breast
brought
wogan
to
his
knee
wogan
held
out
the
pope
procuration
to
the
chevalier
who
took
it
and
devoutly
kissed
the
signature
then
he
gave
his
hand
to
wogan
with
a
smile
of
friendliness
you
have
outsped
your
time
by
two
days
wogan
that
is
unwise
since
it
may
lead
us
to
expect
again
the
impossible
of
you
but
here
alas
your
speed
for
once
brings
us
no
profit
you
have
heard
no
doubt
her
highness
the
princess
clementina
is
held
at
innspruck
in
prison
wogan
rose
to
his
feet
prisons
sir
he
said
quietly
have
been
broken
before
i
myself
was
once
put
to
that
necessity
the
words
took
the
chevalier
completely
by
surprise
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
wogan
an
army
could
not
rescue
her
he
said
no
but
one
man
might
you
he
exclaimed
he
pressed
down
the
shade
of
the
lamp
to
throw
the
light
fully
upon
wogan
face
it
is
impossible
then
i
beg
your
majesty
to
expect
the
impossible
again
the
chevalier
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
stared
afresh
at
wogan
the
audacity
of
the
exploit
and
the
imperturbable
manner
of
its
proposal
caught
his
breath
away
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
took
a
turn
or
two
across
the
room
wogan
watched
his
every
gesture
it
would
be
difficult
he
knew
to
wring
the
permission
he
needed
from
his
dejected
master
and
his
unruffled
demeanour
was
a
calculated
means
of
persuasion
an
air
of
confidence
was
the
first
requisite
in
reality
however
wogan
was
not
troubled
at
this
moment
by
any
thought
of
failure
it
was
not
that
he
had
any
plan
in
his
head
but
he
was
fired
with
a
conviction
that
somehow
this
chosen
woman
was
not
to
be
wasted
that
some
day
released
by
some
means
in
spite
of
all
the
pressure
english
ministers
could
bring
upon
the
emperor
she
would
come
riding
into
bologna
the
chevalier
paused
in
his
walk
and
looked
towards
the
cardinal
what
does
your
eminence
say
that
to
the
old
the
impulsiveness
of
youth
is
eternally
charming
said
the
cardinal
with
a
foppish
delicacy
of
speaking
in
an
odd
contrast
to
his
person
wogan
understood
that
he
had
a
second
antagonist
i
am
not
a
youth
your
eminence
he
exclaimed
with
all
the
indignation
of
years
i
am
a
man
but
an
irishman
and
that
spells
youth
you
write
poetry
too
i
believe
wogan
it
is
a
heady
practice
wogan
made
no
answer
though
the
words
stung
an
argument
with
the
cardinal
would
be
sure
to
ruin
his
chance
of
obtaining
the
consent
he
merely
bowed
to
the
cardinal
and
waited
for
the
chevalier
to
speak
look
you
wogan
while
the
emperor
at
war
with
spain
while
england
fleet
could
strip
him
of
sicily
he
england
henchman
he
dare
not
let
the
princess
go
we
know
it
general
heister
the
governor
of
innspruck
is
under
pain
of
death
to
hold
her
safe
but
sir
would
the
world
stop
if
general
heister
died
a
german
scaffold
if
you
fail
in
the
matter
of
scaffolds
i
have
no
leaning
towards
any
one
nationality
the
cardinal
smiled
he
liked
a
man
of
spirit
though
he
might
think
him
absurd
the
chevalier
resumed
his
restless
pacing
to
and
fro
it
is
impossible
but
he
seemed
to
utter
the
phrase
with
less
decision
this
second
time
wogan
pressed
his
advantage
at
the
expense
of
his
modesty
sir
will
you
allow
me
to
tell
you
a
story
a
story
of
an
impossible
escape
from
newgate
in
the
heart
of
london
by
a
man
in
fetters
there
were
nine
grenadiers
with
loaded
muskets
standing
over
him
there
were
two
courtyards
to
cross
two
walls
to
climb
and
beyond
the
walls
the
unfriendly
streets
the
man
hoodwinked
his
sentries
climbed
his
two
walls
crossed
the
unfriendly
streets
and
took
refuge
in
a
cellar
where
he
was
discovered
from
the
cellar
in
broad
daylight
he
fought
his
way
to
the
roofs
and
on
the
roofs
he
played
such
a
game
of
among
the
wogan
broke
off
from
his
story
with
a
clear
thrill
of
laughter
it
was
a
laugh
of
enjoyment
at
a
pleasing
recollection
then
he
suddenly
flung
himself
down
on
his
knee
at
the
feet
of
his
sovereign
give
me
leave
your
majesty
he
cried
passionately
let
me
go
upon
this
errand
if
i
fail
if
the
dressed
for
me
why
where
the
harm
your
majesty
loses
one
servant
out
of
his
many
whereas
if
i
win
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
aye
and
i
shall
win
there
the
princess
too
a
prisoner
sir
she
has
ventured
much
i
beg
you
give
me
leave
the
chevalier
laid
his
hand
gently
upon
wogan
shoulder
but
he
did
not
assent
he
looked
again
doubtfully
to
the
cardinal
who
said
with
his
pleasant
smile
i
will
wager
wogan
a
box
at
the
opera
on
the
first
night
that
he
returns
that
he
will
return
wogan
rose
to
his
feet
and
replied
it
a
wager
i
take
the
more
readily
in
that
your
eminence
can
not
win
though
you
may
lose
for
if
i
return
upon
my
honour
i
not
return
at
all
the
cardinal
condescended
to
laugh
wogan
laughed
too
he
had
good
reason
for
here
was
his
eminence
in
a
kindly
temper
and
the
chevalier
warming
out
of
his
melancholy
and
indeed
while
he
was
still
laughing
the
chevalier
caught
him
by
the
arm
as
a
friend
might
do
and
in
an
outburst
of
confidence
very
rare
with
him
he
said
i
would
that
i
could
laugh
so
you
and
whittington
i
do
envy
you
an
honest
laugh
there
the
purge
for
melancholy
but
i
can
not
compass
it
and
he
turned
away
sure
sir
you
put
us
all
to
shame
when
i
bring
her
royal
highness
out
of
innspruck
oh
that
said
the
chevalier
as
though
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
it
is
impossible
and
the
phrase
was
spoken
now
in
an
accent
of
hesitation
moreover
he
sat
down
at
a
table
and
drawing
a
sheet
of
paper
written
over
with
memoranda
he
began
to
read
aloud
with
a
glance
towards
wogan
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
the
house
stands
in
the
of
innspruck
there
is
an
avenue
of
trees
in
front
of
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
avenue
there
is
a
tavern
with
the
sign
of
white
chamois
wogan
committed
the
words
to
memory
the
princess
and
her
mother
continued
the
chevalier
are
imprisoned
in
the
east
side
of
the
house
and
how
guarded
sir
asked
wogan
the
chevalier
read
again
from
his
paper
a
sentry
at
each
door
a
third
beneath
the
prisoners
windows
they
keep
watch
night
and
day
besides
twice
a
day
the
magistrate
visits
the
house
at
what
hours
at
ten
in
the
morning
the
same
hour
at
night
and
on
each
visit
the
magistrate
sees
the
princess
yes
though
she
lies
abed
wogan
stroked
his
chin
the
cardinal
regarded
him
quizzically
i
trust
wogan
that
we
shall
hear
farini
there
is
talk
of
his
coming
to
bologna
wogan
did
not
answer
he
was
silent
he
saw
the
three
sentinels
standing
watchfully
about
the
house
he
heard
them
calling
all
well
each
to
the
other
then
he
asked
has
the
princess
her
own
servants
to
attend
her
only
chateaudoux
her
chamberlain
ah
wogan
leaned
forward
with
a
question
on
his
tongue
he
hardly
dared
to
ask
so
much
hung
upon
the
answer
and
chateaudoux
is
allowed
to
come
and
go
in
the
daylight
wogan
turned
to
the
cardinal
the
box
will
be
the
best
box
in
the
house
wogan
suggested
oh
sir
replied
the
cardinal
on
the
first
tier
to
be
sure
wogan
turned
back
to
the
chevalier
all
that
i
need
now
is
a
letter
from
your
majesty
to
the
king
of
poland
and
a
few
rascally
guineas
i
can
leave
bologna
before
a
soul
astir
in
the
morning
no
one
but
whittington
saw
me
and
a
word
will
keep
him
silent
there
will
be
secrecy
but
the
chevalier
suddenly
cut
him
short
no
said
he
bringing
the
palm
of
his
hand
down
upon
the
table
here
a
blow
that
we
must
bend
to
it
a
dream
this
plan
of
yours
but
a
dream
i
dream
so
hard
sir
that
i
dream
it
true
cried
wogan
in
despair
no
no
said
the
chevalier
we
talk
no
more
of
it
there
will
evident
in
this
arrest
and
we
must
bend
to
it
and
at
once
wogan
remembered
his
one
crowning
argument
it
was
so
familiar
to
his
thoughts
it
had
lain
so
close
at
his
heart
that
he
had
left
it
unspoken
taking
it
as
it
were
for
granted
that
others
were
as
familiar
with
it
as
he
sir
said
he
eagerly
i
have
never
told
you
but
the
princess
clementina
when
a
child
amongst
her
playmates
had
a
favourite
game
they
called
it
kings
and
queens
and
in
that
game
the
princess
was
always
chosen
queen
of
england
the
chevalier
started
is
that
so
and
he
gazed
into
wogan
eyes
making
sure
that
he
spoke
the
truth
in
very
truth
it
is
and
the
two
men
stood
looking
each
at
the
other
and
quite
silent
it
was
the
truth
a
mere
coincidence
if
you
will
but
to
both
these
men
omens
and
auguries
were
the
gravest
matters
there
indeed
is
god
finger
pointing
cried
wogan
sir
give
me
leave
to
follow
it
the
chevalier
still
stood
looking
at
him
in
silence
then
he
said
suddenly
go
then
and
god
speed
you
you
are
a
gallant
gentleman
he
sat
down
thereupon
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
king
of
poland
asking
him
to
entrust
the
rescue
of
his
daughter
into
wogan
hands
this
letter
wogan
took
and
money
for
his
journey
you
will
have
preparations
to
make
said
the
chevalier
i
will
not
keep
you
you
have
horses
wogan
had
two
in
a
stable
at
bologna
but
he
added
there
is
a
horse
i
left
this
morning
six
miles
this
side
of
fiesole
a
black
horse
and
i
would
not
lose
it
nor
shall
you
said
the
chevalier
wogan
crept
back
to
his
lodging
as
cautiously
as
he
had
left
it
there
was
no
light
in
any
window
but
in
his
own
where
his
servant
marnier
awaited
him
wogan
opened
the
door
softly
and
found
the
porter
asleep
in
his
chair
he
stole
upstairs
and
made
his
preparations
these
however
were
of
the
simplest
kind
and
consisted
of
orders
to
marnier
and
the
getting
into
bed
in
the
morning
he
woke
before
daybreak
and
found
marnier
already
up
they
went
silently
out
of
the
house
as
the
dawn
was
breaking
marnier
had
the
key
to
the
stables
and
they
saddled
the
two
horses
and
rode
through
the
blind
and
silent
streets
with
their
faces
muffled
in
their
cloaks
they
met
no
one
however
until
they
were
come
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
but
then
as
they
passed
the
mouth
of
an
alley
a
man
came
suddenly
out
and
as
suddenly
drew
back
the
morning
was
chill
and
the
man
was
closely
wrapped
wogan
could
not
distinguish
his
face
or
person
and
looking
down
the
alley
he
saw
at
the
end
of
it
only
a
garden
wall
and
over
the
top
of
the
wall
a
thicket
of
trees
and
the
of
a
low
house
embosomed
amongst
them
he
rode
on
secure
in
the
secrecy
of
his
desperate
adventure
but
that
same
morning
whittington
paid
a
visit
to
wogan
lodging
and
asked
to
be
admitted
he
was
told
that
wogan
had
not
yet
returned
to
bologna
so
indeed
i
thought
said
he
and
he
sauntered
carelessly
along
not
to
his
own
house
but
to
one
smaller
situated
at
the
bottom
of
a
and
secluded
amongst
trees
at
the
door
he
asked
whether
her
ladyship
was
yet
visible
and
was
at
once
shown
into
a
room
with
long
windows
which
stood
open
to
the
garden
her
ladyship
lay
upon
a
sofa
sipping
her
coffee
and
teasing
a
spaniel
with
the
toe
of
her
slipper
you
are
early
she
said
with
some
surprise
and
yet
no
earlier
than
your
ladyship
said
whittington
i
have
to
make
my
obeisance
to
my
king
said
she
stifling
a
yawn
could
one
i
ask
you
sleep
on
so
important
a
day
whittington
laughed
genially
then
he
opened
the
door
and
glanced
along
the
passage
when
he
turned
back
into
the
room
her
ladyship
had
kicked
the
spaniel
from
the
sofa
and
was
sitting
bolt
upright
with
all
her
languor
gone
well
she
asked
quickly
whittington
took
a
seat
on
the
sofa
by
her
side
charles
wogan
left
bologna
at
daybreak
moreover
i
have
had
a
message
from
the
chevalier
bidding
me
not
to
mention
that
i
saw
him
in
bologna
yesterday
one
could
hazard
a
guess
at
the
goal
of
so
secret
a
journey
ohlau
exclaimed
the
lady
in
a
whisper
then
she
nestled
back
upon
the
sofa
and
bit
the
fragment
of
lace
she
called
her
handkerchief
so
there
an
end
of
wogan
she
said
pleasantly
whittington
made
no
answer
for
there
no
chance
that
he
succeed
she
continued
with
a
touch
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
whittington
neither
agreed
nor
contradicted
he
asked
a
question
instead
what
is
the
sharpest
spur
a
man
can
know
what
is
it
that
gives
a
man
audacity
to
attempt
and
wit
to
accomplish
the
impossible
the
lady
smiled
the
poets
tell
us
love
said
she
demurely
whittington
nodded
his
head
wogan
speaks
very
warmly
of
the
princess
clementina
her
ladyship
red
lips
lost
their
curve
her
eyes
became
thoughtful
apprehensive
i
wonder
she
said
slowly
yes
i
too
wonder
said
whittington
outside
the
branches
of
the
trees
rustled
in
the
wind
and
flung
shadows
swift
as
ripples
across
the
sunlit
grass
but
within
the
little
room
there
was
a
long
silence
chapter
iv
chateaudoux
the
chamberlain
was
a
little
portly
person
with
a
round
red
face
like
a
cherub
he
was
a
creature
of
the
house
one
that
walked
with
delicate
steps
a
conductor
of
ceremonies
an
expert
in
the
subtleties
of
etiquette
and
once
he
held
his
wand
of
office
in
his
hand
there
was
nowhere
to
be
found
a
being
so
precise
and
consequential
but
out
of
doors
he
had
the
timidity
of
a
cat
he
lived
however
by
rule
and
rote
and
since
it
had
always
been
his
habit
to
take
the
air
between
three
and
four
of
the
afternoon
he
was
to
be
seen
between
those
hours
at
innspruck
on
any
fine
day
mincing
along
the
avenue
of
trees
before
the
villa
in
which
his
mistress
was
held
prisoner
on
one
afternoon
during
the
month
of
october
he
passed
a
hawker
who
tired
with
his
day
tramp
was
resting
on
a
bench
in
the
avenue
and
who
carried
upon
his
arm
a
basket
of
cheap
wares
the
man
was
ragged
his
toes
were
thrusting
through
his
shoes
it
was
evident
that
he
wore
no
linen
and
a
week
growth
of
beard
dirtily
stubbled
his
chin
in
a
word
he
was
a
man
from
whom
chateaudoux
prim
soul
positively
shrank
chateaudoux
went
quickly
by
fearing
to
be
pestered
for
alms
the
hawker
however
remained
seated
upon
the
bench
drawing
idle
patterns
upon
the
gravel
with
a
hazel
stick
stolen
from
a
hedgerow
the
next
afternoon
the
hawker
was
in
the
avenue
again
only
this
time
on
a
bench
at
the
opposite
end
and
again
he
paid
no
heed
to
chateaudoux
but
sat
moodily
scraping
the
gravel
with
his
stick
on
the
third
afternoon
chateaudoux
found
the
hawker
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
avenue
and
over
against
the
door
of
the
guarded
villa
chateaudoux
when
his
timidity
slept
was
capable
of
good
nature
there
was
a
soldier
with
a
loaded
musket
in
full
view
the
hawker
besides
had
not
pestered
him
he
determined
to
buy
some
small
thing
a
mirror
perhaps
which
was
always
useful
and
he
approached
the
hawker
who
for
his
part
wearily
flicked
the
gravel
with
his
stick
and
drew
a
curve
here
and
a
line
there
until
as
chateaudoux
stopped
before
the
bench
there
lay
sketched
at
his
feet
the
rude
semblance
of
a
crown
the
stick
swept
over
it
the
next
instant
and
left
the
gravel
smooth
but
chateaudoux
had
seen
and
his
heart
fluttered
and
sank
for
here
were
plots
possibly
dangers
most
certainly
trepidations
he
turned
his
back
as
though
he
had
seen
nothing
and
constraining
himself
to
a
slow
pace
walked
towards
the
door
of
the
villa
but
the
hawker
was
now
at
his
side
whining
in
execrable
german
and
a
strong
french
accent
the
remarkable
value
of
his
wares
there
were
samplers
most
exquisitely
worked
jewels
for
the
most
noble
gentleman
honoured
sweetheart
and
purses
which
emperors
would
give
a
deal
to
buy
chateaudoux
was
urged
to
take
notice
that
emperors
would
give
sums
to
lay
a
hand
on
the
purses
chateaudoux
pretended
not
to
hear
i
want
nothing
he
said
nothing
in
the
world
and
he
repeated
the
statement
in
order
to
drown
the
other
voice
a
purse
good
gentleman
persisted
the
hawker
and
he
dangled
one
before
chateaudoux
eyes
not
for
anything
would
chateaudoux
take
that
purse
go
away
he
cried
i
have
a
sufficiency
of
purses
and
i
will
not
be
plagued
by
you
they
were
now
at
the
steps
of
the
villa
and
the
sentry
lifting
the
butt
of
his
musket
roughly
thrust
the
hawker
back
what
have
you
there
bring
your
basket
here
said
he
and
to
chateaudoux
consternation
the
hawker
immediately
offered
the
purse
to
the
sentinel
it
is
only
the
poor
who
have
kind
hearts
he
said
here
the
proper
purse
for
a
soldier
it
is
so
hard
to
get
the
money
out
that
a
man
is
saved
an
ocean
of
drink
the
hawker
readiness
destroyed
any
suspicions
the
sentinel
may
have
felt
go
away
he
said
quick
you
will
buy
the
purse
the
sentinel
raised
his
musket
again
then
the
kind
gentleman
will
said
the
hawker
and
he
thrust
the
purse
into
chateaudoux
reluctant
hand
chateaudoux
could
feel
within
the
purse
a
folded
paper
he
was
committed
now
without
a
doubt
and
in
an
extreme
alarm
he
flung
a
coin
into
the
roadway
and
got
him
into
the
house
the
sentinel
carelessly
dropped
the
butt
of
his
musket
on
the
coin
go
said
he
and
with
a
sudden
kick
he
lifted
the
hawker
half
across
the
road
the
hawker
happened
to
be
charles
wogan
who
took
a
little
matter
like
that
with
the
necessary
philosophy
he
picked
himself
up
and
limped
off
now
the
next
day
a
remarkable
thing
happened
chateaudoux
swerved
from
the
regularity
of
his
habits
he
walked
along
the
avenue
it
is
true
but
at
the
end
of
it
he
tripped
down
a
street
and
turned
out
of
that
into
another
which
brought
him
to
the
arcades
he
did
not
appear
to
enjoy
his
walk
indeed
any
hurrying
footsteps
behind
startled
him
exceedingly
and
made
his
face
turn
white
and
red
and
his
body
hot
and
cold
however
he
proceeded
along
the
arcades
to
the
cathedral
which
he
entered
and
just
as
the
clock
struck
three
in
a
dark
corner
opposite
to
the
third
of
the
great
statues
he
drew
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
the
handkerchief
flipped
out
a
letter
which
fell
onto
the
ground
in
the
gloom
it
was
barely
visible
and
chateaudoux
walked
on
apparently
unconscious
of
his
loss
but
a
comfortable
citizen
in
a
suit
picked
it
up
and
walked
straight
out
of
the
cathedral
to
the
golden
fleece
inn
in
the
hochstrasse
where
he
lodged
he
went
up
into
his
room
and
examined
the
letter
it
was
superscribed
to
chateaudoux
and
the
seal
was
broken
nevertheless
the
finder
did
not
scruple
to
read
it
it
was
a
to
the
little
gentleman
from
one
friederika
i
am
wrote
friederika
but
my
fidelity
to
my
chateaudoux
has
not
faltered
nor
will
not
whatever
i
may
be
called
upon
to
endure
i
can
not
however
be
so
undutiful
as
to
accept
my
chateaudoux
addresses
without
my
father
consent
and
my
mother
who
is
of
the
same
mind
with
me
insists
that
even
with
that
consent
a
runaway
marriage
is
not
to
be
thought
of
unless
my
chateaudoux
can
provide
me
with
a
suitable
woman
for
an
attendant
these
conditions
fulfilled
friederika
was
willing
to
follow
her
chateaudoux
to
the
world
end
the
comfortable
citizen
in
the
suit
sat
for
some
while
over
that
letter
with
a
strange
light
upon
his
face
and
a
smile
of
great
happiness
the
comfortable
citizen
was
charles
wogan
and
he
could
dissociate
the
obstructions
of
the
mother
from
the
willingness
of
the
girl
the
october
evening
wove
its
veils
from
the
mountain
crests
across
the
valleys
the
sun
and
the
daylight
had
gone
from
the
room
before
wogan
tore
that
letter
up
and
wrote
another
to
the
chevalier
at
bologna
telling
him
that
the
princess
clementina
would
venture
herself
gladly
if
he
could
secure
the
consent
of
prince
sobieski
her
father
and
the
next
morning
he
drove
out
in
a
carriage
towards
ohlau
in
silesia
it
was
as
the
chevalier
warner
that
he
had
first
journeyed
thither
to
solicit
for
his
king
the
princess
clementina
hand
consequently
he
used
the
name
again
winter
came
upon
him
as
he
went
the
snow
gathered
thick
upon
the
hills
and
crept
down
into
the
valleys
encumbering
his
path
the
cold
nipped
his
bones
he
drove
beneath
great
clouds
and
through
a
stinging
air
but
of
these
discomforts
he
was
not
sensible
for
the
mission
he
was
set
upon
filled
his
thoughts
and
ran
like
a
fever
in
his
blood
he
lay
awake
at
nights
inventing
schemes
of
evasion
and
each
morning
showed
a
flaw
and
the
schemes
crumbled
not
that
his
faith
faltered
at
some
one
moment
he
felt
sure
the
perfect
plan
swift
and
secret
would
be
revealed
to
him
and
he
lived
to
seize
the
moment
the
people
with
whom
he
spoke
became
as
shadows
the
inns
where
he
rested
were
confused
into
a
common
semblance
he
was
like
a
man
in
a
trance
seeing
ever
before
his
eyes
the
guarded
villa
at
innspruck
and
behind
the
walls
patient
and
watchful
the
face
of
the
chosen
woman
so
that
it
was
almost
with
surprise
that
he
looked
down
one
afternoon
from
the
brim
of
a
pass
in
the
hills
and
saw
beneath
him
hooded
with
snow
the
roofs
and
towers
of
ohlau
at
ohlau
wogan
came
to
the
end
of
his
luck
from
the
moment
when
he
presented
his
letter
he
was
aware
of
it
the
prince
was
broken
by
his
humiliation
and
the
sufferings
of
his
wife
and
daughter
he
was
even
inclined
to
resent
them
at
the
expense
of
the
chevalier
for
in
his
welcome
to
wogan
there
was
a
measure
of
embarrassment
his
shoulders
which
had
before
been
erect
now
stooped
his
eyes
were
veiled
the
fire
had
burnt
out
in
him
he
was
an
old
man
visibly
ageing
to
his
grave
he
read
the
letter
and
it
no
said
he
impatiently
i
must
now
think
of
my
daughter
her
dignity
and
her
birth
forbid
that
she
should
run
like
a
criminal
in
fear
of
capture
and
at
the
peril
very
likely
of
her
life
to
a
king
who
after
all
is
as
yet
without
a
crown
and
then
seeing
wogan
flush
at
the
words
he
softened
them
i
frankly
say
to
you
warner
that
i
know
no
one
to
whom
i
would
sooner
entrust
my
daughter
than
yourself
were
i
persuaded
to
this
project
but
it
is
doomed
to
fail
it
would
make
us
the
of
europe
and
i
ask
you
to
forget
it
do
you
fancy
the
emperor
guards
my
daughter
so
ill
that
you
can
take
her
from
beneath
his
hand
your
highness
i
shall
choose
some
tried
friends
to
help
me
there
is
no
single
chance
of
success
i
ask
you
to
forget
it
and
to
pass
your
christmas
here
as
my
very
good
friend
the
sight
is
longer
in
age
warner
than
in
youth
and
i
see
far
enough
now
to
know
that
the
days
of
don
quixote
are
dead
here
is
a
matter
where
all
europe
is
ranged
and
alert
on
one
side
or
the
other
you
can
not
practise
secrecy
at
ohlau
your
face
is
known
your
incognito
too
warner
came
to
ohlau
once
before
and
the
business
on
which
he
came
is
common
knowledge
the
motive
of
your
visit
now
which
i
tell
you
openly
is
very
grateful
to
me
will
surely
be
suspected
wogan
had
reason
that
night
to
acknowledge
the
justice
of
the
argument
he
accepted
his
hospitality
thinking
that
with
time
he
would
persuade
him
to
allow
the
attempt
and
after
supper
while
making
riddles
in
verse
to
amuse
some
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
one
of
them
the
countess
of
berg
came
forward
from
a
corner
where
she
had
been
busy
with
pencil
and
paper
and
said
it
is
our
turn
now
here
warner
is
an
acrostic
which
i
ask
you
to
solve
for
me
and
with
a
smile
which
held
a
spice
of
malice
she
handed
him
the
paper
upon
it
there
were
ten
rhymed
couplets
wogan
solved
the
first
four
and
found
that
the
initial
letters
of
the
words
were
c
l
e
the
answer
to
the
acrostic
was
clementina
wogan
gave
the
paper
back
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
said
he
the
attempt
is
beyond
my
powers
ah
said
she
drily
you
own
as
much
i
would
never
have
believed
you
would
have
owned
it
but
what
is
the
answer
asked
a
voice
at
which
wogan
started
the
answer
replied
the
countess
is
mary
queen
of
scots
who
was
most
unjustly
imprisoned
in
fotheringay
and
she
tore
the
paper
into
tiny
pieces
wogan
turned
towards
the
voice
which
had
so
startled
him
and
saw
the
gossamer
lady
whom
he
had
befriended
on
the
road
from
florence
at
once
he
rose
and
bowed
to
her
i
should
have
presented
you
before
to
my
friend
lady
featherstone
said
the
countess
but
it
seems
you
are
already
acquainted
indeed
warner
did
me
a
great
service
at
a
pinch
said
lady
featherstone
he
was
my
postillion
though
i
never
paid
him
as
i
do
now
in
thanks
your
postillion
cried
one
or
two
of
the
ladies
and
they
gathered
about
the
great
stove
as
lady
featherstone
told
the
story
of
charioting
i
bade
him
hurry
said
she
and
he
outsped
my
bidding
never
was
there
a
postillion
so
considerately
inconsiderate
i
was
tossed
like
a
tennis
ball
i
was
one
black
bruise
i
bounced
from
cushion
to
cushion
and
then
he
drew
up
with
a
jerk
sprang
off
his
horse
vanished
into
a
house
and
left
me
panting
and
dishevelled
a
twist
of
torn
ribbons
and
lace
alone
in
my
carriage
in
the
streets
of
bologna
bologna
ah
said
the
countess
with
a
smile
of
significance
at
wogan
wogan
was
looking
at
lady
featherstone
his
curiosity
thrust
into
the
back
of
his
mind
by
the
more
important
matter
of
his
mission
now
revived
what
had
been
this
lady
business
who
travelled
alone
to
bologna
and
in
such
desperate
haste
your
ladyship
i
remember
he
said
gave
me
to
understand
that
you
were
sorely
put
to
it
to
reach
bologna
her
ladyship
turned
her
blue
eyes
frankly
upon
wogan
then
she
lowered
them
my
brother
she
explained
lay
at
death
door
in
venice
i
had
just
landed
at
leghorn
where
i
left
my
maid
to
recover
from
the
sea
and
hurrying
across
italy
as
i
did
i
still
feared
that
i
should
not
see
him
alive
the
explanation
was
made
readily
in
a
low
voice
natural
to
one
remembering
a
great
distress
but
without
any
affectation
of
gesture
or
so
much
as
a
glance
sideways
to
note
whether
wogan
received
it
trustfully
or
not
wogan
indeed
was
reassured
in
a
great
measure
true
the
countess
of
berg
was
now
his
declared
enemy
but
he
need
not
join
all
her
friends
in
that
hostility
i
was
able
most
happily
continued
lady
featherstone
to
send
my
brother
homewards
in
a
ship
a
fortnight
back
and
so
to
stay
with
my
friend
here
on
my
way
to
vienna
for
we
english
are
all
bitten
with
the
madness
of
travel
warner
will
bear
me
out
to
be
sure
i
will
said
wogan
stoutly
for
here
am
i
in
the
depths
of
winter
journeying
to
the
carnival
in
italy
the
countess
smiled
all
disbelief
and
amusement
and
lady
featherstone
turned
quickly
towards
him
for
my
frankness
i
claim
a
like
frankness
in
return
said
she
with
a
pretty
imperiousness
wogan
was
a
little
startled
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
pretended
to
know
no
english
on
the
road
to
bologna
nor
had
he
given
any
reason
for
his
haste
but
it
was
upon
neither
of
these
matters
that
she
desired
to
question
him
you
spoke
in
parables
said
she
which
are
detestable
things
you
said
you
would
not
lose
your
black
horse
for
the
world
because
the
lady
you
were
to
marry
would
ride
upon
it
into
your
city
of
dreams
there
a
saying
that
has
a
provoking
prettiness
i
claim
a
frank
answer
wogan
was
silent
and
his
face
took
on
the
look
of
a
dreamer
come
said
one
it
was
the
princess
charlotte
the
second
daughter
of
the
prince
sobieski
who
spoke
we
shall
not
let
you
off
said
she
wogan
knew
that
she
would
not
she
was
a
girl
who
was
never
checked
by
any
inconvenience
her
speech
might
cause
her
tongue
was
a
rattle
and
she
never
spoke
but
she
laughed
to
point
the
speech
be
frank
said
the
countess
it
is
a
matter
of
the
heart
and
so
proper
food
for
women
true
answered
wogan
lightly
it
is
a
matter
of
the
heart
and
in
such
matters
can
one
be
frank
even
to
oneself
wogan
was
immediately
puzzled
by
the
curious
look
lady
featherstone
gave
him
the
words
were
a
mere
excuse
yet
she
seemed
to
take
them
very
seriously
her
eyes
sounded
him
yes
she
said
slowly
are
you
frank
even
to
yourself
and
she
spoke
as
though
a
knowledge
of
the
answer
would
make
a
task
easier
to
her
wogan
speculations
however
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
princess
casimira
sobieski
eldest
daughter
wogan
welcomed
her
coming
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
for
she
was
a
a
person
of
an
extraordinary
decorum
according
to
wogan
she
was
that
black
care
upon
the
horseman
back
which
the
poets
write
about
her
first
question
if
she
was
spoken
to
was
whether
the
speaker
was
from
top
to
toe
fitly
attired
her
second
whether
the
words
spoken
were
at
this
moment
however
her
mere
presence
put
an
end
to
the
demands
for
an
explanation
of
wogan
saying
about
his
horse
and
in
a
grateful
mood
to
her
he
slipped
from
the
room
this
evening
was
but
one
of
many
during
that
christmastide
wogan
must
wear
an
easy
countenance
though
his
heart
grew
heavy
as
lead
the
countess
of
berg
was
the
prince
constantine
favourite
and
wogan
was
not
slow
to
discover
that
her
smiling
face
and
quiet
eyes
hid
the
most
masterful
woman
at
that
court
he
made
himself
her
assiduous
servant
whether
in
hunting
amid
the
snow
or
in
the
entertainments
at
the
palace
but
a
quizzical
deliberate
word
would
now
and
again
show
him
that
she
was
still
his
enemy
with
the
princess
casimira
he
was
a
profound
critic
of
observances
he
invented
a
new
cravat
and
was
most
careful
that
there
should
never
be
a
wrinkle
in
his
stockings
with
the
princess
charlotte
he
laughed
till
his
head
sang
he
played
all
manner
of
parts
the
palace
might
have
been
the
stage
of
a
pantomime
and
himself
the
harlequin
but
for
all
his
efforts
it
did
not
seem
that
he
advanced
his
cause
and
if
he
made
headway
one
evening
with
the
prince
the
next
morning
he
had
lost
it
and
so
christmas
came
and
passed
but
two
days
after
christmas
a
courier
brought
a
letter
to
the
castle
he
came
in
the
evening
and
the
letter
was
carried
to
wogan
while
he
was
at
table
he
noticed
at
once
that
it
was
in
his
king
hand
and
he
slipped
it
quickly
into
his
pocket
it
may
have
been
something
precipitate
in
his
manner
or
it
may
have
been
merely
that
all
were
on
the
alert
to
mark
his
actions
but
at
once
curiosity
was
aroused
no
plain
words
were
said
but
here
and
there
heads
nodded
together
and
whispered
and
while
some
eyed
wogan
suspiciously
a
few
women
whose
hearts
were
tuned
to
a
sympathy
with
the
princess
in
her
imprisonment
or
touched
with
the
notion
of
a
romantic
attachment
smiled
upon
him
their
encouragement
the
countess
of
berg
for
once
was
unobservant
however
wogan
made
his
escape
from
the
company
as
soon
as
he
could
and
going
up
to
his
apartments
read
the
letter
the
moon
was
at
its
full
and
what
with
the
clear
frosty
air
and
the
snow
stretched
over
the
world
like
a
white
counterpane
he
was
able
to
read
the
letter
by
the
window
without
the
light
of
a
candle
it
was
written
in
the
chevalier
own
cipher
and
hand
it
asked
anxiously
for
news
and
gave
some
wogan
had
had
occasion
before
to
learn
that
cipher
by
heart
he
stood
by
the
window
and
spelled
the
meaning
then
he
turned
to
go
down
but
at
the
door
his
foot
slipped
upon
the
polished
boards
and
he
stumbled
onto
his
knee
he
picked
himself
up
and
thinking
no
more
of
the
matter
rejoined
the
company
in
a
room
where
the
countess
of
berg
was
playing
upon
a
harp
the
king
said
wogan
drawing
the
prince
apart
leaves
bologna
for
rome
so
the
letter
came
from
him
asked
the
prince
with
an
eagerness
which
could
not
but
seem
hopeful
to
his
companion
and
in
his
own
hand
replied
wogan
the
prince
shuffled
and
hesitated
as
though
he
was
curious
to
hear
particulars
wogan
thought
it
wise
to
provoke
his
curiosity
by
disregarding
it
it
seemed
that
there
was
wisdom
in
his
reticence
for
a
little
later
the
prince
took
him
aside
while
the
countess
of
berg
was
still
playing
upon
her
harp
and
said
you
could
do
nothing
you
would
need
friends
wogan
took
a
slip
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
prince
on
that
slip
said
he
i
wrote
down
the
names
of
all
the
friends
whom
i
could
trust
and
by
the
side
of
the
names
the
places
where
i
could
lay
my
hands
upon
them
one
after
the
other
i
erased
the
names
until
only
three
remained
the
prince
nodded
and
read
out
the
names
gaydon
misset
they
are
good
men
the
flower
of
ireland
those
three
names
have
been
my
comfort
these
last
three
weeks
and
all
the
three
at
schlestadt
how
comes
that
about
your
highness
they
are
all
three
officers
in
dillon
irish
regiment
and
so
have
that
further
advantage
advantage
your
highness
said
wogan
schlestadt
is
near
to
strasbourg
which
again
is
not
far
from
innspruck
and
being
in
french
territory
would
be
the
most
convenient
place
to
set
off
from
there
was
a
sound
of
a
door
shutting
the
prince
started
looked
at
wogan
and
laughed
he
had
been
upon
the
verge
of
yielding
but
for
that
door
wogan
felt
sure
he
would
have
yielded
now
however
he
merely
walked
away
to
the
countess
of
berg
and
sitting
beside
her
asked
her
to
play
a
particular
tune
but
he
still
held
the
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
paid
but
a
scanty
heed
to
the
music
now
and
then
looking
doubtfully
towards
wogan
now
and
then
scanning
that
long
list
of
names
his
lips
too
moved
as
though
he
was
framing
the
three
selected
names
gaydon
misset
and
schlestadt
as
a
bracket
uniting
them
then
he
suddenly
rose
up
and
crossed
the
room
to
wogan
my
daughter
wrote
that
a
woman
must
attend
her
it
is
a
necessary
provision
your
highness
misset
has
a
wife
and
the
wife
matches
him
they
are
warned
to
be
ready
at
your
highness
first
word
that
slip
of
paper
travels
to
schlestadt
it
is
unsigned
it
imperils
no
one
it
betrays
nothing
but
it
will
tell
its
story
none
the
less
surely
to
those
three
men
for
gaydon
knows
my
hand
the
prince
smiled
in
approval
you
have
prudence
warner
as
well
as
audacity
said
he
he
gave
the
paper
back
listened
for
a
little
to
the
countess
who
was
bending
over
her
and
then
remarked
the
prince
letter
was
in
his
own
hand
too
but
in
cipher
ah
the
prince
was
silent
for
a
while
he
balanced
himself
first
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
ciphers
said
he
are
curious
things
compelling
to
the
imagination
and
a
provocation
to
the
intellect
wogan
kept
a
grave
face
and
he
replied
with
unconcern
though
his
heart
beat
quick
for
if
the
prince
had
so
much
desire
to
see
the
chevalier
letter
he
must
be
well
upon
his
way
to
consenting
to
wogan
plan
if
your
highness
will
do
me
the
honour
to
look
at
this
cipher
it
has
baffled
the
most
expert
his
highness
condescended
to
be
pleased
with
wogan
suggestion
wogan
crossed
the
room
towards
the
door
but
before
he
reached
it
the
countess
of
berg
suddenly
took
her
fingers
from
her
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
warner
she
said
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
screw
this
wire
tighter
and
once
or
twice
she
struck
it
with
her
fingers
may
i
claim
that
privilege
said
the
prince
your
highness
does
me
too
much
honour
said
the
countess
but
the
prince
was
already
at
her
side
at
once
she
pointed
out
to
him
the
particular
string
wogan
went
from
the
room
and
up
the
great
staircase
he
was
lodged
in
a
wing
of
the
palace
from
the
head
of
the
staircase
he
proceeded
down
a
long
passage
towards
the
end
of
this
passage
another
short
passage
branched
off
at
a
right
angle
on
the
side
at
the
corner
of
the
two
passages
stood
a
table
with
a
lamp
and
some
candlesticks
this
time
wogan
took
a
candle
and
lighting
it
at
the
lamp
turned
into
the
short
passage
it
was
dark
but
for
the
light
of
candle
and
at
the
end
of
it
facing
him
were
two
doors
side
by
side
both
doors
were
closed
and
of
these
the
one
on
the
left
gave
onto
his
room
wogan
had
walked
perhaps
halfway
from
the
corner
to
his
door
before
he
stopped
he
stopped
suddenly
and
held
his
breath
then
he
shaded
his
candle
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
looked
forward
immediately
he
turned
and
walking
on
tiptoe
came
silently
back
into
the
big
passage
even
this
was
not
well
lighted
it
stretched
away
upon
his
right
and
left
full
of
shadows
but
it
was
silent
the
only
sounds
which
reached
wogan
as
he
stood
there
and
listened
were
the
sounds
of
people
moving
and
speaking
at
a
great
distance
he
blew
out
his
candle
cautiously
replaced
it
on
the
table
and
crept
down
again
towards
his
room
there
was
no
window
in
this
small
passage
there
was
no
light
there
at
all
except
a
gleam
of
silver
in
front
of
him
and
close
to
the
ground
that
gleam
of
silver
was
the
moonlight
shining
between
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
doors
and
the
boards
of
the
passage
and
that
door
was
not
the
door
of
wogan
room
but
the
room
beside
it
where
his
door
stood
there
might
have
been
no
door
at
all
yet
the
moon
which
shone
through
the
windows
of
one
room
must
needs
also
shine
into
the
other
unless
indeed
the
curtains
were
drawn
but
earlier
in
the
evening
wogan
had
read
a
letter
by
the
moonlight
at
his
window
the
curtains
were
not
drawn
there
was
therefore
a
rug
an
obstruction
of
some
sort
against
the
bottom
of
the
door
but
earlier
in
the
evening
wogan
foot
had
slipped
upon
the
polished
boards
there
had
been
no
mat
or
skin
at
all
it
had
been
pushed
there
since
wogan
could
not
doubt
for
what
reason
it
was
to
conceal
the
light
of
a
lamp
or
candle
within
the
room
someone
in
a
word
was
prying
in
wogan
room
and
wogan
began
to
consider
who
it
was
not
the
countess
who
was
engaged
upon
her
harp
but
the
countess
had
tried
to
detain
him
wogan
was
startled
as
he
understood
the
reason
of
her
harp
becoming
so
suddenly
untuned
she
had
spoken
to
him
with
so
natural
a
spontaneity
she
had
accepted
the
prince
aid
with
so
complete
an
absence
of
embarrassment
but
none
the
less
wogan
was
sure
that
she
knew
moreover
a
door
had
shut
yes
while
he
was
speaking
to
the
prince
a
door
had
shut
so
far
wogan
speculations
had
travelled
when
the
moonlight
streamed
out
beneath
his
door
too
it
made
now
a
silver
line
across
the
passage
broken
at
the
middle
by
the
wall
between
the
rooms
the
mat
had
been
removed
the
candle
put
out
the
prying
was
at
an
end
in
another
moment
the
door
would
surely
open
now
wogan
however
anxious
to
discover
who
it
was
that
spied
was
yet
more
anxious
that
the
spy
should
not
discover
that
the
spying
was
detected
he
himself
knew
and
so
was
armed
he
did
not
wish
to
arm
his
enemies
with
a
like
knowledge
there
was
no
corner
in
the
passage
to
conceal
him
there
was
no
other
door
behind
which
he
could
slip
when
the
spy
came
out
wogan
would
inevitably
be
discovered
he
made
up
his
mind
on
the
instant
he
crept
back
quickly
and
silently
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
passage
then
he
made
a
noise
with
his
feet
turned
again
into
the
passage
and
walked
loudly
towards
his
door
even
so
he
was
only
just
in
time
had
he
waited
a
moment
longer
he
would
have
been
detected
for
even
as
he
turned
the
corner
there
was
already
a
vertical
line
of
silver
on
the
passage
wall
the
door
had
been
already
opened
but
as
his
footsteps
sounded
on
the
boards
that
line
disappeared
he
walked
slowly
giving
his
spy
time
to
replace
the
letter
time
to
hide
he
purposely
carried
no
candle
he
reached
his
door
and
opened
it
the
room
to
all
seeming
was
empty
wogan
crossed
to
a
table
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
above
all
not
looking
towards
the
bed
hangings
he
found
the
letter
upon
the
table
just
as
he
had
left
it
it
could
convey
no
knowledge
of
his
mission
he
was
sure
it
had
not
even
the
appearance
of
a
letter
in
cipher
it
might
have
been
a
mere
expression
of
christmas
good
wishes
from
one
friend
to
another
but
to
make
his
certainty
more
sure
and
at
the
same
time
to
show
that
he
had
no
suspicion
anyone
was
hiding
in
the
room
he
carried
the
letter
over
to
the
window
and
at
once
he
was
aware
of
the
spy
it
was
not
the
bed
hangings
but
close
at
his
side
the
heavy
window
curtain
bulged
the
spy
was
at
his
very
elbow
he
had
but
to
lift
his
arm
and
of
a
sudden
the
letter
slipped
from
his
hand
to
the
floor
he
did
not
drop
it
on
purpose
he
was
fairly
surprised
for
looking
down
to
read
the
letter
he
had
seen
protruding
from
the
curtain
a
jewelled
shoe
buckle
and
the
foot
which
the
buckle
adorned
seemed
too
small
and
slender
for
a
man
wogan
had
an
opportunity
to
make
certain
he
knelt
down
and
picked
up
the
letter
the
foot
was
a
woman
as
he
rose
up
again
the
curtain
ever
so
slightly
stirred
wogan
pretended
to
have
remarked
nothing
he
stood
easily
by
the
window
with
his
eyes
upon
his
letter
and
his
mind
busy
with
guessing
what
woman
his
spy
might
be
and
he
remained
on
purpose
for
some
while
in
this
attitude
designing
it
as
a
punishment
so
long
as
he
stood
by
the
window
that
unknown
woman
cheek
by
jowl
with
him
must
hold
her
breath
must
never
stir
must
silently
endure
an
agony
of
fear
at
each
movement
that
he
made
at
last
he
moved
and
as
he
turned
away
he
saw
something
so
unexpected
that
it
startled
him
indeed
for
the
moment
it
did
more
than
startle
him
it
chilled
him
he
understood
that
slight
stirring
of
the
curtain
the
woman
now
held
a
dagger
in
her
hand
and
the
point
of
the
blade
stuck
out
and
shone
in
the
moonlight
like
a
flame
wogan
became
angry
it
was
all
very
well
for
the
woman
to
come
spying
into
his
room
but
to
take
a
dagger
to
him
to
think
a
dagger
in
a
woman
hand
could
cope
with
him
that
was
too
preposterous
wogan
felt
very
much
inclined
to
sweep
that
curtain
aside
and
tell
his
visitor
how
he
had
escaped
from
newgate
and
played
amongst
the
and
although
he
restrained
himself
from
that
he
allowed
his
anger
to
get
the
better
of
his
prudence
under
the
impulse
of
his
anger
he
acted
it
was
a
whimsical
thing
that
he
did
and
though
he
suffered
for
it
he
could
never
afterwards
bring
himself
to
regret
it
he
deliberately
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
instep
of
the
foot
which
protruded
from
the
curtain
he
felt
the
muscles
of
the
foot
tighten
but
the
foot
was
not
withdrawn
the
curtain
shivered
and
shook
but
no
cry
came
from
behind
it
and
again
the
curtain
hung
motionless
wogan
went
out
of
the
room
and
carried
the
letter
to
the
prince
the
countess
of
berg
was
still
playing
upon
her
harp
and
she
gave
no
sign
that
she
remarked
his
entrance
she
did
not
so
much
as
shoot
one
glance
of
curiosity
towards
him
the
prince
carried
the
letter
off
to
his
cabinet
while
wogan
sat
down
beside
the
countess
and
looked
about
the
room
i
have
not
seen
lady
featherstone
this
evening
said
he
have
you
not
asked
the
countess
easily
not
so
much
as
her
foot
replied
wogan
the
conviction
came
upon
him
suddenly
her
hurried
journey
to
bologna
and
her
presence
at
ohlau
were
explained
to
him
now
by
her
absence
from
the
room
his
own
arrival
at
bologna
had
not
remained
so
secret
as
he
had
imagined
the
fragile
and
gossamer
lady
too
flowerlike
for
the
world
rough
usage
was
the
woman
who
had
spied
in
his
room
and
who
had
possessed
the
courage
to
stand
silent
and
motionless
behind
the
curtain
after
her
presence
there
had
been
discovered
wogan
had
a
picture
before
his
eyes
of
the
dagger
she
had
held
it
was
plain
that
she
would
stop
at
nothing
to
hinder
this
marriage
to
prevent
the
success
of
his
design
and
somehow
the
contrast
between
her
appearance
and
her
actions
had
something
uncanny
about
it
wogan
was
inclined
to
shiver
as
he
sat
chatting
with
the
countess
he
was
not
reassured
when
lady
featherstone
boldly
entered
the
room
she
meant
to
face
him
out
he
remarked
however
with
a
trifle
of
satisfaction
that
for
the
first
time
she
wore
rouge
upon
her
cheeks
chapter
v
wogan
however
was
not
immediately
benefited
by
his
discovery
he
knew
that
if
a
single
whisper
of
it
reached
the
prince
ear
there
would
be
at
once
an
end
to
his
small
chances
the
old
man
would
take
alarm
he
might
punish
the
offender
but
he
would
none
the
less
surely
refuse
his
consent
to
wogan
project
wogan
must
keep
his
lips
quite
closed
and
let
his
antagonists
do
boldly
what
they
would
and
that
they
were
active
he
found
a
way
to
discover
the
countess
from
this
time
plied
him
with
kindness
he
must
play
cards
with
her
and
prince
constantine
in
the
evening
he
must
take
his
coffee
in
her
private
apartments
in
the
morning
so
upon
one
of
these
occasions
he
spoke
of
his
departure
from
ohlau
i
shall
go
by
way
of
prague
and
he
stopped
in
confusion
and
corrected
himself
quickly
at
least
i
am
not
sure
there
are
other
ways
into
italy
the
countess
showed
no
more
concern
than
she
had
shown
over
her
she
talked
indifferently
of
other
matters
as
though
she
had
barely
heard
his
remark
but
she
fell
into
the
trap
wogan
was
aware
that
the
governor
of
prague
was
her
kinsman
and
that
afternoon
he
left
the
castle
alone
and
taking
the
road
to
vienna
turned
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
and
hurried
round
the
town
until
he
came
out
upon
the
road
to
prague
he
hid
himself
behind
a
hedge
a
mile
from
ohlau
and
had
not
waited
half
an
hour
before
a
man
came
riding
by
in
hot
haste
the
man
wore
the
countess
livery
of
green
and
scarlet
wogan
decided
not
to
travel
by
way
of
prague
and
returned
to
the
castle
content
with
his
afternoon
work
he
had
indeed
more
reason
to
be
content
with
it
than
he
knew
for
he
happened
to
have
remarked
the
servant
face
as
well
as
his
livery
and
so
at
a
later
time
was
able
to
recognise
it
again
he
had
no
longer
any
doubt
that
a
servant
in
the
same
livery
was
well
upon
his
way
to
vienna
the
roads
were
bad
it
was
true
and
the
journey
long
but
wogan
had
not
the
prince
consent
and
could
not
tell
when
he
would
obtain
it
the
servant
might
return
with
the
emperor
order
for
his
arrest
before
he
had
obtained
it
wogan
was
powerless
he
sent
his
list
of
names
to
gaydon
in
schlestadt
but
that
was
the
only
precaution
he
could
take
the
days
passed
wogan
spent
them
in
unavailing
persuasions
and
new
year
day
came
and
found
him
still
at
ohlau
and
in
a
great
agitation
and
distress
upon
that
morning
however
while
he
was
dressing
there
came
a
rap
upon
his
door
and
when
he
opened
it
he
saw
the
prince
treasurer
a
foppish
gentleman
very
dainty
in
his
words
warner
said
the
treasurer
his
highness
has
hinted
to
me
his
desires
he
has
moulded
them
into
the
shape
of
a
prayer
or
a
request
in
a
word
he
has
bidden
you
said
wogan
fie
sir
there
a
barbarous
and
improper
word
an
word
upon
my
honour
a
word
without
dignity
or
merit
and
banishable
from
polite
speech
his
highness
did
most
prettily
entreat
me
with
a
fine
gentleness
of
condescension
befitting
a
sunday
or
a
new
year
day
to
bring
and
present
and
communicate
from
hand
to
hand
a
gift
a
most
incomparable
proper
gift
the
mirror
and
image
of
his
most
incomparable
proper
friendship
wogan
bowed
and
requested
the
treasurer
to
enter
and
be
seated
the
while
he
recovered
his
breath
nay
warner
i
must
be
concise
puritanical
and
unadorned
in
my
language
as
any
or
the
cruel
irrevocable
moments
pass
i
could
consume
an
hour
sir
before
i
touched
as
i
may
say
the
hem
of
the
reason
of
my
coming
sir
i
do
not
doubt
it
said
wogan
but
i
will
not
hinder
you
from
forthwith
immediately
and
at
once
incorporating
with
your
most
particular
and
inestimable
treasures
this
jewel
this
turquoise
of
heaven
own
charming
blue
encased
and
decorated
with
gold
the
treasurer
drew
the
turquoise
from
his
pocket
it
was
of
the
size
of
an
egg
he
placed
it
in
wogan
hand
who
gently
returned
it
i
can
not
take
it
said
he
gemini
cried
the
treasurer
but
it
is
more
than
a
turquoise
warner
jewellers
have
delved
in
it
it
has
become
subservient
to
necessities
it
is
a
i
can
not
take
it
king
john
of
poland
he
whom
the
vulgar
call
glorious
john
did
rescue
and
enlarge
it
from
its
slavery
to
the
grand
vizier
of
turkey
at
the
great
battle
of
vienna
there
is
no
other
in
the
world
wogan
cut
the
treasurer
short
you
will
take
it
again
to
his
highness
you
will
express
to
him
my
gratitude
for
his
kindness
and
you
will
say
furthermore
these
words
warner
can
not
carry
back
into
italy
a
present
for
himself
and
a
refusal
for
his
prince
wogan
spoke
with
so
much
dignity
that
the
treasurer
had
no
words
to
answer
him
he
stood
utterly
bewildered
he
stared
at
the
jewel
here
is
a
quandary
he
exclaimed
i
do
declare
every
circumstance
of
me
trembles
and
shaking
his
head
he
went
away
but
in
a
little
he
came
again
his
highness
distinguishes
you
warner
with
imperishable
honours
his
highness
solicits
your
company
to
a
solitary
dinner
you
shall
dine
with
him
alone
his
presence
and
unfettered
conversation
shall
season
your
soup
and
be
the
condiments
of
your
meat
wogan
heart
jumped
there
could
be
only
one
reason
for
so
unusual
an
invitation
on
such
a
day
and
he
was
not
mistaken
for
as
soon
as
the
prince
was
served
in
a
little
room
he
dismissed
the
lackeys
and
presented
again
the
turquoise
with
his
own
hands
see
wogan
your
persuasions
and
your
conduct
have
gained
me
over
said
he
your
refusal
of
this
bagatelle
assures
me
of
your
honour
i
trust
myself
entirely
to
your
discretion
i
confide
my
beloved
daughter
to
your
care
take
from
my
hands
the
gift
you
refused
this
morning
and
be
assured
that
no
prince
ever
gave
to
any
man
such
full
powers
as
i
will
give
to
you
wogan
gratitude
wellnigh
overcame
him
the
thing
that
he
had
worked
for
and
almost
despaired
of
had
come
to
pass
for
a
while
he
could
not
speak
he
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
and
kissed
the
prince
hand
that
very
night
he
received
the
letter
giving
him
full
powers
and
the
next
morning
he
drove
off
in
a
carriage
of
his
highness
drawn
by
six
polish
horses
towards
the
town
of
strahlen
on
the
road
to
prague
at
strahlen
he
stayed
a
day
feigning
a
malady
and
sent
the
carriage
back
the
following
day
however
he
took
horse
and
riding
along
and
lanes
avoided
prague
and
hurried
towards
schlestadt
he
rode
watchfully
avoiding
towns
and
with
an
eye
alert
for
every
that
he
was
ahead
of
any
courier
from
the
emperor
at
vienna
he
did
not
doubt
but
on
the
other
hand
the
countess
of
berg
and
lady
featherstone
had
the
advantage
of
him
by
some
four
days
there
would
be
no
lack
of
money
to
hinder
him
there
would
be
no
scruple
as
to
the
means
wogan
remembered
the
moment
in
his
bedroom
when
he
had
seen
the
dagger
bright
in
the
moon
rays
if
he
could
not
be
arrested
there
were
other
ways
to
stop
him
accidents
may
happen
to
any
man
however
he
rode
unhindered
with
the
prince
commission
safe
against
his
breast
he
felt
the
paper
a
hundred
times
a
day
to
make
sure
that
it
was
not
stolen
nor
lost
nor
reduced
to
powder
by
a
miracle
day
by
day
his
fears
diminished
since
day
by
day
he
drew
a
day
journey
nearer
to
schlestadt
the
paper
became
a
talisman
in
his
thoughts
a
thing
endowed
with
magic
properties
to
make
him
invisible
like
the
cloak
or
cap
of
the
fairy
tales
those
few
lines
in
writing
not
a
week
back
had
seemed
an
unattainable
prize
yet
he
had
them
and
so
now
they
promised
him
that
other
unattainable
thing
the
enlargement
of
the
princess
it
was
in
his
nature
too
to
grow
buoyant
in
proportion
to
the
difficulties
of
his
task
he
rode
forward
therefore
with
a
good
heart
and
one
sombre
evening
of
rain
came
to
a
village
some
miles
beyond
augsburg
the
village
was
a
straggling
of
low
cottages
lost
as
it
were
on
the
level
of
a
wide
plain
across
this
plain
bare
but
for
a
few
lines
of
poplars
and
stunted
wogan
had
ridden
all
the
afternoon
and
so
little
did
the
thatched
cottages
break
the
monotony
of
the
plain
appearance
that
though
he
had
had
the
village
within
his
vision
all
that
while
he
came
upon
it
unawares
the
dusk
was
gathering
and
already
through
the
tiny
windows
the
meagre
lights
gleamed
upon
the
road
and
gave
to
the
falling
raindrops
the
look
of
steel
beads
four
days
would
now
bring
wogan
to
schlestadt
the
road
was
bad
and
full
of
holes
he
determined
to
go
no
farther
that
night
if
he
could
find
a
lodging
in
the
village
and
coming
upon
a
man
who
stood
in
his
path
he
stopped
his
horse
is
there
an
inn
where
a
traveller
may
sleep
he
asked
assuredly
replied
the
man
and
find
forage
for
his
horse
the
last
house
but
i
will
myself
show
your
honour
the
way
there
is
no
need
my
friend
that
you
should
take
a
colic
said
wogan
i
shall
earn
enough
drink
to
correct
the
colic
said
the
man
he
had
a
sack
over
his
head
and
shoulders
to
protect
him
from
the
rain
and
stepped
out
in
front
of
wogan
horse
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
street
and
passed
on
into
the
open
darkness
about
twenty
yards
farther
a
house
stood
by
itself
at
the
roadside
but
there
were
only
lights
in
one
or
two
of
the
upper
windows
and
it
held
out
no
promise
of
hospitality
in
front
of
it
however
the
man
stopped
he
opened
the
door
and
halloaed
into
the
passage
wogan
stopped
too
and
above
his
head
something
creaked
and
groaned
like
a
gibbet
in
the
wind
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
glimmering
in
the
dusk
with
a
new
coat
of
white
paint
he
had
undoubtedly
come
to
the
inn
and
he
dismounted
the
landlord
advanced
at
that
moment
to
the
door
my
man
said
he
will
take
your
horse
to
the
stable
and
the
fellow
who
had
guided
wogan
led
the
horse
off
oh
is
he
your
man
said
wogan
ah
and
he
followed
the
landlord
into
the
house
it
was
not
only
the
which
had
been
newly
painted
for
in
the
narrow
passage
the
landlord
stopped
wogan
have
a
care
sir
said
he
the
walls
are
wet
it
will
be
best
if
you
stand
still
while
i
go
forward
and
bring
a
light
he
went
forward
in
the
dark
and
opened
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
a
glow
of
ruddy
light
came
through
the
doorway
and
wogan
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
kitchen
and
a
great
open
chimney
and
one
or
two
men
on
a
bench
before
the
fire
then
the
door
was
again
closed
the
closing
of
the
door
seemed
to
wogan
a
churlish
act
the
hospitality
said
he
to
himself
which
plants
a
man
in
the
road
so
that
a
traveller
on
a
rainy
night
may
not
miss
his
bed
should
at
least
leave
the
kitchen
door
open
why
should
i
stay
here
in
the
dark
wogan
went
forward
and
from
the
careful
way
in
which
he
walked
a
way
so
careful
and
stealthy
indeed
that
his
footsteps
made
no
sound
it
might
have
been
inferred
that
he
believed
the
floor
to
be
newly
painted
too
he
had
at
all
events
no
such
scruples
about
the
kitchen
door
for
he
seized
the
handle
and
flung
it
open
quickly
he
was
met
at
once
by
a
cold
draught
of
wind
a
door
opposite
and
giving
onto
a
yard
at
the
back
had
been
opened
at
precisely
the
same
moment
and
as
wogan
stepped
quickly
in
at
his
door
a
man
stepped
quickly
out
by
the
door
opposite
and
was
lost
in
the
darkness
what
are
you
going
the
landlord
cried
after
him
as
he
turned
from
the
fire
at
which
he
was
lighting
a
candle
wilhelm
has
a
wife
and
needs
must
at
once
said
a
woman
who
was
reaching
down
some
plates
from
a
dresser
the
landlord
turned
towards
the
passage
and
saw
wogan
in
the
doorway
you
found
your
way
sir
said
he
looking
at
wogan
anxiously
nor
are
your
walls
any
poorer
of
paint
on
that
account
said
wogan
as
he
took
his
wet
cloak
and
flung
it
over
a
chair
the
landlord
blew
out
his
candle
and
busied
himself
about
laying
the
table
a
great
iron
pot
swung
over
the
fire
by
a
chain
and
the
lid
danced
on
the
top
and
allowed
a
savoury
odour
to
escape
wogan
sat
himself
down
before
the
fire
and
his
clothes
began
to
steam
you
laugh
at
my
paint
sir
said
the
landlord
he
was
a
fat
man
communicative
in
his
manner
as
a
boniface
should
be
and
his
wife
was
his
very
complement
you
laugh
at
my
paint
but
it
is
after
all
a
very
important
thing
what
is
a
great
lady
without
her
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
the
same
with
an
inn
it
must
wear
paint
if
it
is
to
attract
attention
and
make
a
profit
there
is
philosophy
in
the
comparison
said
wogan
sir
an
innkeeper
can
not
fail
of
philosophy
if
he
has
his
eyes
and
a
spark
of
intelligence
the
man
who
took
refuge
in
a
tub
because
the
follies
of
his
fellows
so
angered
him
was
the
greatest
fool
of
them
all
he
should
have
kept
an
inn
on
the
road
to
athens
for
then
the
follies
would
have
put
money
into
his
pocket
and
made
him
laugh
instead
of
growl
his
wife
came
over
to
the
fireplace
and
lifted
the
lid
of
the
pot
the
supper
is
ready
said
she
and
perhaps
sir
while
you
are
eating
it
you
can
think
of
a
name
for
my
inn
why
it
has
a
already
said
wogan
and
a
name
too
i
suppose
it
has
a
but
without
a
device
said
the
landlord
and
while
wogan
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
he
explained
his
predicament
there
is
another
inn
five
miles
along
the
road
and
travellers
prefer
to
make
their
halt
there
they
will
not
stop
here
my
father
sir
set
it
all
down
to
paint
it
was
his
dream
sir
to
paint
the
house
from
floor
to
ceiling
his
last
words
bade
me
pinch
and
save
until
i
could
paint
well
here
is
the
house
painted
and
i
am
anxious
for
a
new
device
and
name
which
shall
obliterate
the
memory
of
the
other
black
eagle
is
its
old
name
ask
any
traveller
familiar
with
the
road
between
augsburg
and
schlestadt
and
he
will
counsel
you
to
avoid
black
eagle
you
are
travelling
to
schlestadt
perhaps
wogan
had
started
ever
so
slightly
to
strasbourg
he
said
and
thereafter
ate
his
supper
in
silence
taking
count
with
himself
my
friend
so
his
thoughts
ran
the
sooner
you
reach
schlestadt
the
better
here
are
you
bleating
like
a
sheep
at
a
mere
chance
mention
of
your
destination
you
have
lived
too
close
with
this
fine
scheme
of
yours
you
need
your
friends
wogan
began
to
be
conscious
of
an
unfamiliar
sense
of
loneliness
it
grew
upon
him
that
evening
while
he
sat
at
the
table
it
accompanied
him
up
the
stairs
to
bed
other
men
of
his
age
were
now
seated
comfortably
by
their
own
hearths
while
he
was
hurrying
about
europe
a
vagabond
adventurer
risking
his
life
for
and
at
once
the
reason
why
he
was
risking
his
life
rose
up
to
convict
him
a
grumbler
the
landlord
led
him
into
a
room
in
the
front
of
the
house
which
held
a
great
canopied
bed
and
little
other
furniture
there
was
not
even
a
curtain
to
the
window
wogan
raised
his
candle
and
surveyed
the
dingy
walls
you
have
not
spent
much
of
your
new
paint
on
your
my
friend
sir
you
have
not
marked
the
door
said
his
host
reproachfully
true
said
wogan
with
a
yawn
the
door
is
admirably
white
the
frame
of
the
door
does
not
suffer
in
a
comparison
the
landlord
raised
and
lowered
his
candle
that
wogan
might
see
i
do
not
wish
to
be
unjust
to
the
frame
of
the
door
said
wogan
and
he
drew
off
his
boots
the
landlord
bade
his
guest
and
descended
the
stairs
wogan
being
a
campaigner
was
methodical
even
though
lost
in
reflection
he
was
reflecting
now
why
in
the
world
he
should
lately
have
become
sensible
of
loneliness
but
at
the
same
time
he
put
the
letter
beneath
his
pillow
and
a
sheathed
beside
the
letter
he
had
always
been
lonely
and
the
fact
had
never
troubled
him
he
placed
a
chair
on
the
left
of
the
bed
and
his
candle
on
the
chair
besides
he
was
not
really
lonely
having
a
host
of
friends
whom
he
had
merely
to
seek
out
he
took
the
charges
from
his
pistol
lest
they
should
be
damp
and
renewed
them
and
placed
the
pistols
by
the
candle
he
had
even
begun
to
pity
himself
for
his
loneliness
and
pity
of
that
sort
he
recognised
was
a
discreditable
quality
the
matter
was
altogether
very
disquieting
he
propped
his
sword
against
the
chair
and
undressed
wogan
cast
back
in
his
memories
for
the
first
sensations
of
loneliness
they
were
recent
since
he
had
left
ohlau
indeed
he
opened
the
window
the
rain
splashed
in
on
the
sill
pattered
in
the
street
puddles
below
and
fell
across
the
country
with
a
continuous
roar
as
though
the
level
plain
was
a
stretched
drum
no
he
had
only
felt
lonely
since
he
had
come
near
to
schlestadt
since
in
a
word
he
had
deemed
himself
to
have
outstripped
pursuit
he
got
into
his
bed
and
blew
out
the
candle
for
a
moment
the
room
was
black
as
pitch
then
on
his
left
side
the
darkness
thinned
at
one
point
and
a
barred
square
of
grey
became
visible
the
square
of
grey
was
the
window
wogan
understood
that
his
loneliness
came
upon
him
with
the
respite
from
his
difficulties
and
concluded
that
after
all
it
was
as
well
that
he
had
not
a
comfortable
fireside
whereby
to
sun
himself
he
turned
over
on
his
right
side
and
saw
the
white
door
and
its
white
frame
the
rain
made
a
dreary
sound
outside
the
window
but
in
three
days
he
would
be
at
schlestadt
besides
he
fell
asleep
and
in
a
little
he
dreamed
he
dreamed
that
he
was
swinging
on
a
gibbet
before
the
whole
populace
of
innspruck
that
he
died
to
his
bewilderment
without
any
pain
whatever
but
that
pain
came
to
him
after
he
was
quite
dead
not
bodily
pain
at
all
but
an
anguish
of
mind
because
the
chains
by
which
he
was
hanged
would
groan
and
creak
and
the
populace
mistaking
that
groaning
for
his
cries
scoffed
at
him
and
ridiculed
his
king
for
sending
to
rescue
the
princess
clementina
a
marrowless
thing
that
could
not
die
like
a
man
wogan
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
waked
up
the
rain
had
ceased
and
a
light
wind
blew
across
the
country
outside
the
creaked
and
groaned
upon
its
stanchion
once
he
became
aware
of
that
sound
he
could
no
longer
sleep
for
listening
to
it
and
at
last
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
leaning
out
of
the
window
lifted
the
off
the
stanchion
and
into
his
bedroom
it
was
a
plain
white
board
without
any
device
on
it
true
thought
wogan
the
man
wants
a
new
name
for
his
inn
he
propped
the
board
against
the
left
side
of
his
bed
since
that
was
nearest
to
the
window
got
between
the
sheets
and
began
to
think
over
names
he
turned
on
his
right
side
and
fell
asleep
again
he
was
not
to
sleep
restfully
that
night
he
waked
again
but
very
slowly
and
without
any
movement
of
his
body
he
lay
with
his
face
towards
the
door
dreamily
considering
that
the
landlord
for
all
his
pride
in
his
new
paint
had
employed
a
bad
workman
who
had
left
a
black
strip
of
the
door
unpainted
a
fairly
wide
strip
too
which
his
host
should
never
have
overlooked
wogan
was
lazily
determining
to
speak
to
the
landlord
about
it
when
his
mind
was
diverted
by
a
curious
phenomenon
a
delusion
of
the
eyes
such
as
he
had
known
to
have
befallen
him
before
when
he
had
stared
for
a
long
while
on
any
particular
object
the
strip
of
black
widened
and
widened
wogan
waited
for
it
to
contract
as
it
would
be
sure
to
do
but
it
did
not
contract
and
so
wogan
waked
up
completely
he
waked
up
with
a
shock
of
the
heart
with
all
his
senses
startled
and
strained
but
he
had
been
gradually
waking
before
and
so
by
neither
movement
nor
cry
did
he
betray
that
he
was
awake
he
had
not
locked
the
door
of
his
room
that
widening
strip
of
black
ran
vertically
down
from
the
lintel
to
the
ground
and
between
the
white
door
and
the
white
door
frame
the
door
was
being
cautiously
pushed
open
the
strip
of
black
was
the
darkness
of
the
passage
coming
through
wogan
slid
his
hand
beneath
his
pillow
and
drew
the
knife
from
its
sheath
as
silently
as
the
door
opened
the
strip
of
black
ceased
to
widen
there
was
a
slight
scuffling
sound
upon
the
floor
which
wogan
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
it
was
the
sound
of
a
man
crawling
into
the
room
upon
his
hands
and
knees
wogan
lay
on
his
side
and
felt
grateful
to
his
host
an
admirable
man
for
he
had
painted
his
door
white
and
now
he
crawled
through
it
on
his
hands
and
knees
no
doubt
he
would
crawl
to
the
side
of
the
bed
he
did
to
feel
no
doubt
for
wogan
coat
and
breeches
and
any
little
letter
which
might
be
hiding
in
the
pockets
but
here
wogan
was
wrong
for
he
saw
a
dark
thing
suddenly
on
the
counterpane
at
the
edge
of
the
bed
the
dark
thing
travelled
upwards
very
softly
it
had
four
fingers
and
a
thumb
it
was
no
doubt
travelling
towards
the
pillow
and
as
soon
as
it
got
there
but
wogan
watching
that
hand
beneath
his
dosed
eyelids
had
again
to
admit
that
he
was
wrong
it
did
not
travel
towards
the
pillow
to
his
astonishment
it
stole
across
towards
him
it
touched
his
chest
very
gently
and
then
he
understood
the
hand
was
creeping
upwards
towards
his
throat
meanwhile
wogan
had
seen
no
face
though
the
face
must
be
just
below
the
level
of
the
bed
he
only
saw
the
hand
and
the
arm
behind
it
he
moved
as
if
in
his
sleep
and
the
hand
disappeared
as
if
in
his
sleep
he
flung
out
his
left
arm
and
felt
for
the
standing
beside
his
bed
the
bed
was
soft
wogan
wanted
something
hard
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
the
would
very
well
serve
his
turn
an
idea
too
which
seemed
to
him
diverting
had
presented
itself
to
his
mind
with
a
loud
sigh
and
a
noisy
movement
such
as
a
man
halfway
between
wakefulness
and
sleep
may
make
he
flung
himself
over
onto
his
left
side
at
the
same
moment
he
lifted
the
white
onto
the
bed
it
seemed
that
he
could
not
rest
on
his
left
side
for
he
flung
over
again
to
his
right
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
over
as
he
turned
the
now
lay
flat
upon
the
bed
but
on
the
right
side
between
himself
and
the
man
upon
the
floor
his
mouth
uttered
a
little
murmur
of
contentment
he
drew
down
the
hand
beneath
the
pillow
and
in
a
second
was
breathing
regularly
and
peacefully
illustration
with
his
right
arm
he
drove
his
hunting
knife
down
into
the
back
of
the
hand
the
hand
crept
onto
the
bed
again
and
upwards
and
suddenly
lay
spread
out
upon
the
board
and
quite
still
just
for
a
second
the
owner
of
that
hand
had
been
surprised
and
paralysed
by
the
unexpected
it
was
only
that
second
which
wogan
needed
he
sat
up
and
with
his
right
arm
he
drove
his
hunting
knife
down
into
the
back
of
the
hand
and
pinned
it
fast
to
the
board
with
his
left
he
felt
for
found
and
gripped
a
mouth
already
open
to
cry
out
he
dropped
his
hunting
knife
caught
the
intruder
round
the
waist
lifted
him
onto
the
bed
and
setting
a
knee
upon
his
chest
gagged
him
with
an
end
of
the
sheet
the
man
fought
wildly
with
his
free
hand
beating
the
air
wogan
knelt
upon
that
arm
with
his
other
knee
wogan
needed
a
rope
but
since
he
had
none
he
used
the
sheets
and
bound
his
prisoner
to
the
bed
then
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
the
house
was
quite
silent
quite
dark
wogan
shut
the
door
gently
there
was
no
key
in
the
lock
and
bending
over
the
bed
looked
into
the
face
of
his
assailant
the
face
was
twisted
with
pain
the
whites
of
the
eyes
glared
horribly
but
wogan
could
see
that
the
man
was
his
landlord
he
stood
up
and
thought
there
was
another
man
who
had
met
him
in
the
village
and
had
guided
him
to
the
inn
there
was
still
a
third
who
had
gone
out
of
the
kitchen
as
wogan
had
entered
it
there
was
the
wife
too
who
might
be
awake
wogan
crossed
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
window
was
perhaps
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
but
the
stanchion
was
three
feet
below
the
window
he
quickly
put
on
his
clothes
slipped
the
letter
from
under
his
pillow
into
a
pocket
strapped
his
and
lowered
it
from
the
window
by
a
blanket
he
had
already
one
leg
on
the
sill
when
a
convulsive
movement
of
the
man
on
the
bed
made
him
stop
he
climbed
back
into
the
room
drew
the
knife
out
of
the
board
and
out
of
the
hand
pinned
to
the
board
and
making
a
bandage
wrapped
the
wound
up
you
must
lie
there
till
morning
my
friend
wogan
whispered
in
his
ear
but
here
a
thing
to
console
you
i
have
found
a
name
for
your
inn
i
have
painted
the
device
upon
your
the
of
the
five
red
fingers
there
never
a
but
will
stop
to
inquire
the
reason
of
so
conspicuous
a
sign
and
wogan
climbed
out
of
the
window
lowered
himself
till
he
hung
at
the
full
length
of
his
arms
from
the
stanchion
and
dropped
on
the
ground
he
picked
up
his
and
crept
round
the
house
to
the
stable
the
door
needed
only
a
push
to
open
it
in
the
above
he
heard
a
man
snoring
wogan
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
disturb
him
he
saddled
his
horse
walked
it
out
into
the
yard
mounted
and
rode
quietly
away
he
had
escaped
but
without
much
credit
to
himself
there
was
no
key
in
the
door
he
thought
i
should
have
noticed
it
misset
the
man
of
resources
would
have
tilted
a
chair
backwards
against
that
door
with
its
top
bar
wedged
beneath
the
door
handle
certainly
wogan
needed
misset
if
he
was
to
succeed
in
his
endeavour
he
was
sunk
in
humiliation
his
very
promise
to
rescue
the
princess
shrank
from
its
grandeur
and
became
a
mere
piece
of
impertinence
but
he
still
had
his
letter
in
his
pocket
and
in
time
that
served
to
enhearten
him
only
two
more
days
he
thought
on
the
third
night
he
would
sleep
in
schlestadt
chapter
vi
the
next
afternoon
wogan
came
to
the
town
of
ulm
gaydon
he
said
to
himself
as
he
watched
its
towers
and
the
smoke
curling
upwards
from
its
chimneys
would
go
no
further
with
this
letter
in
his
pocket
gaydon
the
cautious
gaydon
would
sleep
in
this
town
and
in
its
most
populous
quarter
gaydon
would
put
up
at
the
busiest
inn
charles
wogan
will
follow
gaydon
example
wogan
rode
slowly
through
the
narrow
streets
of
gabled
houses
until
he
came
to
the
market
square
the
square
was
frequented
its
great
fountain
was
playing
citizens
were
taking
the
air
with
their
wives
and
children
the
chief
highway
of
the
town
ran
through
it
on
one
side
stood
the
frescoed
rathhaus
and
opposite
to
it
there
was
a
spacious
inn
wogan
drew
up
at
the
doorway
and
saw
that
the
hall
was
encumbered
with
baggage
gaydon
would
stop
here
said
he
and
he
dismounted
the
porter
came
forward
and
took
his
horse
i
need
a
room
said
wogan
and
he
entered
the
house
there
were
people
going
up
and
down
the
stairs
while
he
was
unstrapping
his
valise
in
his
bedroom
a
servant
with
an
apron
about
his
waist
knocked
at
the
door
and
inquired
whether
he
could
help
him
no
said
wogan
and
he
thought
with
more
confidence
than
ever
here
to
be
sure
is
where
gaydon
would
sleep
he
supped
at
the
ordinary
in
the
company
of
linen
merchants
and
travellers
and
quite
recovered
his
spirits
he
smoked
a
pipe
of
tobacco
on
a
bench
under
the
trees
of
the
square
and
giving
an
order
that
he
should
be
called
at
five
went
up
to
his
bedroom
there
was
a
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door
which
wogan
turned
he
also
tilted
a
chair
and
wedged
the
handle
he
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
his
room
was
on
the
first
floor
and
not
very
high
from
the
ground
a
man
might
possibly
climb
through
the
window
gaydon
would
assuredly
close
the
shutters
and
the
window
so
that
no
one
could
force
an
entrance
without
noise
wogan
accordingly
did
what
gaydon
would
assuredly
have
done
and
when
he
blew
out
his
candle
found
himself
in
consequence
in
utter
darkness
no
glimmer
of
light
was
anywhere
visible
he
had
his
habits
like
another
and
one
of
them
was
to
sleep
without
blinds
or
curtains
drawn
his
present
deflection
from
this
habit
made
him
restless
he
was
tired
he
wished
above
all
things
to
sleep
but
sleep
would
not
come
he
turned
from
one
side
to
the
other
he
punched
his
pillows
he
tried
to
sleep
with
his
head
low
and
when
that
failed
with
his
head
high
he
resigned
himself
in
the
end
to
a
sleepless
night
and
lying
in
his
bed
drew
some
comfort
from
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
tread
of
feet
in
the
passages
and
the
rooms
about
him
these
at
all
events
were
companionable
and
they
assured
him
of
safety
but
in
a
while
they
ceased
and
he
was
left
in
a
silence
as
absolute
as
the
darkness
he
endured
this
silence
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
and
then
all
manner
of
infinitesimal
sounds
began
to
stir
about
him
the
lightest
of
footsteps
moved
about
his
bed
faint
sighs
breathed
from
very
close
at
hand
even
his
name
was
softly
whispered
he
sat
suddenly
up
in
his
bed
and
at
once
all
these
sounds
became
explained
to
him
they
came
from
the
street
and
the
square
outside
the
window
so
long
as
he
sat
up
they
were
remote
but
the
moment
he
lay
down
again
they
peopled
the
room
sure
said
wogan
here
is
a
lesson
for
architects
build
no
shutters
to
a
house
when
the
man
that
has
to
live
in
it
has
a
spark
of
imagination
else
will
he
go
stark
raving
mad
before
the
mortar
dry
window
shutters
are
window
shutters
but
they
are
the
doors
of
bedlam
as
well
now
gaydon
should
have
slept
in
this
room
gaydon
a
great
man
gaydon
has
a
great
deal
of
observation
and
common
sense
and
was
never
plagued
with
a
of
fancies
to
be
sure
i
need
gaydon
but
since
i
have
not
gaydon
i
light
a
candle
with
that
wogan
got
out
of
bed
he
had
made
himself
so
secure
with
his
key
and
his
tilted
chair
and
his
shutters
that
he
had
not
thought
of
placing
his
candle
by
his
bedside
it
stood
by
his
on
the
table
now
the
room
was
so
pitch
dark
that
wogan
could
do
no
more
than
guess
at
the
position
even
of
the
window
the
table
he
remembered
was
not
far
from
the
door
and
the
door
was
at
some
distance
from
his
bed
and
in
the
wall
on
his
right
he
moved
forward
in
the
darkness
with
his
hands
in
front
of
him
groping
for
the
table
the
room
was
large
in
a
little
his
hands
touched
something
and
that
something
was
a
pillar
of
the
bed
he
had
missed
his
way
in
his
bedroom
wogan
laughed
to
himself
and
started
off
again
and
the
next
thing
which
his
outstretched
hands
touched
was
a
doorknob
the
table
should
now
be
a
little
way
to
his
left
he
was
just
turning
away
in
that
direction
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
to
have
felt
the
rim
of
the
top
bar
of
his
tilted
chair
underneath
the
he
stooped
down
and
felt
for
the
chair
there
was
no
chair
and
he
stood
very
still
the
fears
bred
of
imagination
had
now
left
him
he
was
restored
by
the
shock
of
an
actual
danger
he
leaned
forward
quietly
and
felt
if
the
key
was
still
in
the
lock
but
there
was
no
lock
to
this
door
wogan
felt
the
surface
of
the
door
it
was
of
paper
it
was
plainly
the
door
of
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
papered
after
the
same
pattern
as
the
wall
which
by
the
flickering
light
of
his
single
candle
he
had
overlooked
he
opened
the
door
and
stretched
out
his
arms
into
the
cupboard
he
touched
something
that
moved
beneath
his
hand
a
stiff
short
crop
of
hair
the
hair
of
a
man
head
he
drew
his
arm
away
as
though
an
adder
had
stung
it
he
did
not
utter
a
cry
or
make
a
movement
he
stood
for
a
moment
paralysed
and
during
that
moment
a
strong
hand
caught
him
by
the
throat
wogan
was
borne
backwards
his
assailant
sprang
at
him
from
the
cupboard
he
staggered
under
the
unexpected
vigour
of
the
attack
he
clutched
his
enemy
and
the
two
men
came
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
even
as
he
fell
wogan
thought
gaydon
would
never
have
overlooked
that
cupboard
it
was
the
only
reflection
however
for
which
he
could
afford
time
he
was
undermost
and
the
hand
at
his
throat
had
the
grip
of
a
steel
glove
he
fought
with
blows
from
his
fists
and
his
bent
knees
he
twisted
his
legs
about
the
legs
of
his
enemy
he
writhed
his
body
if
so
he
might
dislodge
him
he
grappled
wildly
for
his
throat
but
all
the
time
his
strength
grew
less
he
felt
that
his
temples
were
swelling
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
eyes
must
burst
the
darkness
of
the
room
was
spotted
with
sparks
of
fire
the
air
was
filled
with
a
continuous
roar
like
a
million
chariots
in
a
street
he
saw
the
face
of
his
chosen
woman
most
reproachful
and
yet
kind
gazing
at
him
from
behind
the
bars
which
now
would
never
be
broken
and
then
there
came
a
loud
banging
at
the
door
the
summons
surprised
them
both
so
hotly
had
they
been
engaged
so
unaware
were
they
of
the
noise
which
their
fall
had
made
wogan
felt
his
assailant
hand
relax
and
heard
him
say
in
a
low
muffled
voice
it
is
nothing
go
to
bed
i
fell
over
a
chair
in
the
dark
that
momentary
relaxation
was
he
knew
his
last
chance
he
gathered
his
strength
in
a
supreme
effort
lurched
over
onto
his
left
side
and
getting
his
right
arm
free
swung
it
with
all
his
strength
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
his
clenched
fist
caught
his
opponent
full
under
the
point
of
the
chin
and
the
hand
at
wogan
throat
clutched
once
and
fell
away
limp
as
an
empty
glove
wogan
sat
up
on
the
floor
and
drew
his
breath
that
after
all
was
more
than
his
antagonist
was
doing
the
knocking
at
the
door
continued
wogan
could
not
answer
it
he
had
not
the
strength
his
limbs
were
shaking
the
sweat
clotted
his
hair
and
dripped
from
his
face
but
his
opponent
was
quieter
still
at
last
he
managed
to
gather
his
legs
beneath
him
to
kneel
up
to
stand
shakily
upon
his
feet
he
could
no
longer
mistake
the
position
of
the
door
he
tottered
across
to
it
removed
the
chair
and
opened
it
the
landlord
with
a
couple
of
servants
stepped
back
as
wogan
showed
himself
to
the
light
of
their
candles
wogan
heard
their
exclamations
though
he
did
not
clearly
understand
them
for
his
ears
still
buzzed
he
saw
their
startled
faces
but
only
dimly
for
he
was
dazzled
by
the
light
he
came
back
into
the
room
and
pointing
to
his
assailant
a
sturdy
broad
man
who
now
sat
up
opening
and
shutting
his
eyes
in
a
dazed
way
who
is
that
he
asked
gasping
rather
than
speaking
the
words
who
is
that
repeated
the
landlord
staring
at
wogan
who
is
that
said
wogan
leaning
against
the
why
sir
your
servant
who
should
he
be
wogan
was
silent
for
a
little
considering
as
well
as
his
rambling
wits
allowed
this
new
development
ah
said
wogan
he
came
here
with
me
yes
since
he
is
your
servant
the
landlord
was
evidently
mystified
he
was
no
less
evidently
speaking
with
sincerity
wogan
reflected
that
to
proffer
a
charge
against
the
assailant
would
involve
his
own
detention
in
ulm
to
be
sure
said
he
i
know
this
is
my
servant
that
is
precisely
what
i
mean
his
wits
were
at
work
to
find
a
way
out
of
his
difficulty
this
is
my
servant
what
then
he
asked
fiercely
but
i
do
understand
said
the
landlord
you
do
understand
cried
wogan
was
there
ever
such
a
landlord
he
does
not
understand
this
is
my
servant
i
tell
you
yes
sir
but
but
well
we
were
roused
there
was
a
noise
a
noise
of
men
fighting
there
would
have
been
no
noise
said
wogan
triumphantly
if
you
had
prepared
a
bed
for
my
servant
he
would
not
have
crept
into
my
cupboard
to
sleep
off
his
drunkenness
but
sir
there
was
a
bed
you
should
have
seen
that
he
was
carried
to
it
as
it
is
here
have
i
been
driven
to
beat
him
and
to
lose
my
night
rest
in
consequence
it
is
not
fitting
i
do
not
think
that
your
inn
is
well
managed
wogan
expressed
his
indignation
with
so
majestic
an
air
that
the
landlord
was
soon
apologising
for
having
disturbed
a
gentleman
in
the
proper
exercise
of
belabouring
his
valet
we
will
carry
the
fellow
away
said
he
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
wogan
he
shall
get
back
into
his
cupboard
and
there
he
shall
remain
till
daybreak
come
get
up
wogan
valet
got
to
his
feet
there
was
no
possibility
of
an
escape
for
him
since
there
were
three
men
between
him
and
the
door
on
the
other
hand
obedience
to
wogan
might
save
him
from
a
charge
of
attempted
theft
in
with
you
said
wogan
and
the
man
obeyed
his
head
no
doubt
was
still
spinning
from
the
blow
and
he
had
the
stupid
look
of
one
dazed
there
is
no
lock
to
the
door
said
the
landlord
there
is
no
need
of
a
lock
said
wogan
so
long
as
one
has
a
chair
the
fellow
will
do
very
well
till
the
morning
but
i
will
take
your
three
candles
for
it
is
not
likely
that
i
shall
sleep
wogan
smoked
his
pipe
all
the
rest
of
the
night
reclining
on
a
couple
of
chairs
in
front
of
the
cupboard
in
the
morning
he
made
his
valet
walk
three
miles
by
his
horse
side
the
man
dared
not
disobey
and
when
wogan
finally
let
him
go
he
was
so
far
from
the
town
that
had
he
confederates
there
he
could
do
no
harm
wogan
continued
his
journey
towns
it
was
proved
were
no
safer
to
him
than
villages
he
began
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
no
traps
had
been
laid
for
him
on
the
earlier
stages
of
his
journey
and
he
suddenly
hit
upon
the
explanation
it
was
that
night
said
he
to
himself
when
the
prince
sat
by
the
countess
with
the
list
of
my
friends
in
his
hands
the
names
were
all
erased
but
three
and
against
those
three
was
that
other
name
of
schlestadt
no
doubt
the
countess
while
she
bent
over
her
took
a
look
at
that
list
i
must
run
the
gauntlet
into
schlestadt
towards
evening
he
came
to
stuttgart
and
rode
through
the
schloss
platz
and
along
the
königstrasse
wogan
would
not
sleep
there
since
there
the
duke
of
würtemberg
held
his
court
and
in
that
court
the
countess
of
berg
was
very
likely
to
have
friends
he
rode
onwards
through
the
valley
along
the
banks
of
the
nesen
brook
until
he
came
to
its
junction
with
the
neckar
a
mile
farther
a
wooden
mill
stood
upon
the
beyond
the
mill
was
a
tavern
and
beyond
the
tavern
stood
a
few
cottages
at
some
distance
from
the
cottages
along
the
road
wogan
could
see
a
high
brick
wall
and
over
the
top
the
chimneys
and
the
slate
roof
of
a
large
house
wogan
stopped
at
the
tavern
it
promised
no
particular
comfort
it
was
a
small
dilapidated
house
but
it
had
the
advantage
that
it
was
free
from
new
paint
it
seemed
to
wogan
however
wellnigh
useless
to
take
precautions
in
the
choice
of
a
lodging
danger
leaped
at
him
from
every
quarter
for
this
last
night
he
must
trust
to
his
luck
and
besides
there
was
the
splash
of
the
water
falling
over
the
it
was
always
something
to
wogan
to
fall
asleep
with
that
sound
in
his
ears
he
dismounted
accordingly
and
having
ordered
his
supper
asked
for
a
room
you
will
sleep
here
exclaimed
his
host
i
will
at
all
events
lie
in
bed
returned
wogan
the
innkeeper
took
a
lamp
and
led
the
way
up
a
narrow
winding
stair
have
a
care
sir
said
he
the
stairs
are
steep
i
prefer
them
steep
i
am
afraid
that
i
keep
the
light
from
you
but
there
is
no
room
for
two
to
walk
abreast
it
is
an
advantage
i
do
not
like
to
be
jostled
on
the
stairs
the
landlord
threw
open
a
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
room
is
a
garret
he
said
in
apology
so
long
as
it
has
no
cupboards
it
will
serve
my
turn
ah
you
do
not
like
cupboards
they
fill
a
poor
man
with
envy
of
those
who
have
clothes
to
hang
in
them
wogan
ascertained
that
there
were
no
cupboards
there
was
a
key
too
in
the
lock
and
a
chest
of
drawers
which
could
be
moved
very
suitably
in
front
of
the
door
it
is
a
good
garret
said
wogan
laying
down
his
bag
upon
a
chair
the
window
is
small
continued
the
landlord
one
will
be
less
likely
to
fall
out
said
wogan
one
would
also
he
thought
be
less
likely
to
climb
in
he
looked
out
of
the
window
it
was
a
good
height
from
the
ground
there
was
no
stanchion
or
projection
in
the
wall
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
man
could
get
his
shoulders
through
the
opening
wogan
opened
the
window
to
try
it
and
the
sound
of
someone
running
came
to
his
ears
oho
said
he
but
he
said
it
to
himself
here
a
man
in
a
mighty
hurry
a
mist
was
rising
from
the
ground
the
evening
too
was
dark
wogan
could
see
no
one
in
the
road
below
but
he
heard
the
footsteps
diminishing
into
a
faint
patter
then
they
ceased
altogether
the
man
who
ran
was
running
in
the
direction
of
stuttgart
yes
your
garret
will
do
said
wogan
in
quite
a
different
voice
he
had
begun
to
think
that
this
night
he
would
sleep
and
he
realised
now
that
he
must
not
the
man
might
be
running
on
his
own
business
but
this
was
the
last
night
before
wogan
would
reach
his
friends
stuttgart
was
only
three
miles
away
he
could
take
no
risks
and
so
he
must
stay
awake
with
his
sword
upon
his
knees
had
his
horse
been
able
to
carry
him
farther
he
would
have
ridden
on
but
the
horse
was
even
more
weary
than
its
master
besides
the
narrow
staircase
made
his
room
an
excellent
place
to
defend
get
my
supper
said
he
for
i
am
very
tired
will
your
excellency
sup
here
asked
the
landlord
by
no
manner
of
means
returned
wogan
who
had
it
in
his
mind
to
spy
out
the
land
i
detest
nothing
so
much
as
my
own
company
he
went
downstairs
into
the
common
room
and
supped
off
a
smoked
ham
and
a
bottle
of
execrable
wine
while
he
ate
a
man
came
in
and
sat
him
down
by
the
fire
the
man
had
a
hot
flushed
face
and
when
he
saluted
wogan
he
could
hardly
speak
you
have
been
running
said
wogan
politely
sir
running
is
a
poor
man
overcoat
for
a
chilly
evening
besides
it
helps
me
to
pay
with
patience
the
price
of
wine
for
vinegar
and
the
fellow
called
the
landlord
presently
two
other
men
entered
and
taking
a
seat
by
the
fire
chatted
together
as
though
much
absorbed
in
their
private
business
these
two
men
wore
swords
you
have
a
good
trade
said
wogan
to
the
landlord
the
mill
brings
me
custom
the
door
opened
as
the
landlord
spoke
and
a
big
man
cheerily
wished
the
company
good
evening
the
two
companions
at
the
fire
paid
no
heed
to
the
civility
the
third
who
had
now
quite
recovered
his
breath
replied
to
it
wogan
pushed
his
plate
away
and
called
for
a
pipe
he
thought
it
might
perhaps
prove
well
worth
his
while
to
study
his
landlord
clients
before
he
retired
up
those
narrow
stairs
the
four
men
gave
no
sign
of
any
common
agreement
nor
were
they
at
all
curious
as
to
wogan
if
they
spoke
at
all
they
spoke
as
strangers
speak
but
while
wogan
was
smoking
his
first
pipe
a
fifth
man
entered
and
he
just
gave
one
quick
glance
at
wogan
wogan
behind
a
cloud
of
saw
the
movement
of
the
head
and
detected
the
look
it
might
signify
nothing
but
curiosity
of
course
but
wogan
felt
glad
that
the
stairs
were
narrow
he
finished
his
pipe
and
was
knocking
out
the
ashes
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
seen
that
fifth
man
before
and
wogan
looked
at
him
more
carefully
and
though
the
fellow
was
disguised
by
the
growth
of
a
beard
he
recognised
him
it
was
the
servant
whom
wogan
had
seen
one
day
in
the
countess
of
berg
livery
of
green
and
red
galloping
along
the
road
to
prague
i
know
enough
now
thought
wogan
i
can
go
to
bed
the
staircase
is
a
pretty
place
with
which
we
shall
all
be
more
familiar
in
an
hour
or
two
he
laughed
quietly
to
himself
with
a
little
thrill
of
enjoyment
his
fatigue
had
vanished
he
was
on
the
point
of
getting
up
from
the
table
when
the
two
men
by
the
fire
looked
round
towards
the
last
comer
and
made
room
for
him
upon
their
settle
but
he
said
i
find
the
room
hot
and
will
stay
by
the
door
wogan
changed
his
mind
at
the
words
he
did
not
get
up
on
the
contrary
he
filled
his
pipe
a
second
time
very
thoughtfully
he
had
stayed
too
long
in
the
room
it
seemed
the
little
staircase
was
after
all
likely
to
prove
of
no
service
he
did
not
betray
himself
by
any
start
or
exclamation
he
did
not
even
look
up
but
bending
his
head
over
his
pipe
he
thought
over
the
disposition
of
the
room
the
fireplace
was
on
his
right
the
door
was
opposite
to
him
the
window
in
the
wall
at
his
left
the
window
was
high
from
the
ground
and
at
some
distance
on
the
other
hand
he
had
certain
advantages
he
was
in
a
corner
he
had
the
five
men
in
front
of
him
and
between
them
and
himself
stood
a
solid
table
a
loaded
pistol
was
in
his
belt
his
sword
hung
at
his
side
and
his
hunting
knife
at
his
waist
still
the
aspect
of
affairs
was
changed
five
men
thought
he
upon
a
narrow
staircase
are
merely
one
man
who
has
to
be
killed
five
times
but
five
men
in
a
room
are
five
simultaneous
assailants
i
need
here
i
need
six
feet
four
and
the
length
of
his
arm
and
the
weight
of
him
these
things
i
need
but
are
there
five
or
only
four
and
he
was
at
once
aware
that
the
two
men
at
the
fire
had
ceased
to
talk
of
their
business
no
one
indeed
was
speaking
at
all
and
no
one
so
much
as
shuffled
a
foot
wogan
raised
his
head
and
proceeded
to
light
his
pipe
and
he
saw
that
all
the
five
men
were
silently
watching
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
those
five
pairs
of
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
however
he
appeared
to
be
entirely
concerned
with
his
pipe
which
however
hard
he
puffed
at
it
would
not
draw
no
doubt
the
tobacco
was
packed
too
tight
in
the
bowl
he
loosened
it
and
when
he
had
loosened
it
the
pipe
had
gone
out
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
discovered
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
a
letter
this
letter
he
glanced
through
to
make
sure
that
it
was
of
no
importance
and
having
informed
himself
upon
the
point
he
folded
it
into
a
long
spill
and
walked
over
to
the
hearth
the
five
pairs
of
eyes
followed
his
movements
he
however
had
no
attention
to
spare
he
bent
down
lit
his
spill
in
the
flame
and
deliberately
lighted
his
pipe
the
tobacco
rose
above
the
rim
of
the
bowl
like
a
head
of
ale
in
a
tankard
wogan
still
holding
the
burning
spill
in
his
right
hand
pressed
down
the
tobacco
with
the
little
finger
of
his
left
and
lighted
the
pipe
again
by
this
time
his
spill
had
burned
down
to
his
fingers
he
dropped
the
end
into
the
fire
and
walked
back
to
his
seat
the
five
pairs
of
eyes
again
turned
as
he
turned
he
stumbled
at
a
crack
in
the
floor
fell
against
the
table
with
a
clatter
of
his
sword
and
rolled
noisily
into
his
seat
when
he
sat
down
a
careful
observer
might
have
noticed
that
his
pistol
was
now
at
full
cock
he
had
barely
seated
himself
when
the
polite
man
who
had
come
first
hot
and
short
of
breath
into
the
room
crossed
the
floor
and
leaning
over
the
table
said
with
a
smile
and
the
gentlest
voice
i
think
sir
you
ought
to
know
that
we
are
all
very
poor
men
i
too
replied
wogan
am
an
irishman
the
polite
man
leaned
farther
across
the
table
his
voice
became
wheedling
in
its
suavity
i
think
you
ought
to
know
that
we
are
all
very
poor
men
the
repetition
of
the
remark
said
wogan
argues
certainly
a
poverty
of
ideas
we
wish
to
become
less
poor
it
is
an
aspiration
which
has
pushed
many
men
to
creditable
feats
you
can
help
us
my
prayers
are
at
your
disposal
said
wogan
by
more
than
your
prayers
and
he
added
in
a
tone
of
apology
there
are
five
of
us
then
i
have
a
guinea
apiece
for
you
and
wogan
thrust
the
table
a
little
away
from
him
to
search
his
pockets
it
also
gave
him
more
play
we
do
not
want
your
money
you
have
a
letter
which
we
can
coin
wogan
smiled
there
sir
you
are
wrong
the
polite
man
waved
the
statement
aside
a
letter
from
prince
sobieski
said
he
i
had
such
a
letter
a
minute
ago
but
i
lit
my
pipe
with
it
under
your
nose
the
polite
man
stepped
back
his
four
companions
started
to
their
feet
the
servant
from
ohlau
cried
out
with
an
oath
it
a
lie
wogan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
crossed
his
legs
here
a
fine
world
said
he
a
damned
rag
of
a
lackey
gives
a
gentleman
the
lie
you
will
give
me
the
letter
said
the
polite
man
coming
round
the
table
he
held
his
right
hand
behind
his
back
you
can
sweep
up
the
ashes
from
the
hearth
said
wogan
who
made
no
movement
of
any
kind
the
polite
man
came
close
to
his
side
wogan
let
him
come
the
polite
man
stretched
out
his
left
hand
towards
pocket
wogan
knocked
the
hand
away
and
the
man
right
arm
swung
upwards
from
behind
his
back
with
a
gleaming
pistol
in
the
hand
wogan
was
prepared
for
him
he
had
crossed
his
legs
to
be
prepared
and
as
the
arm
came
round
he
kicked
upwards
from
the
knee
the
toe
of
his
heavy
boot
caught
the
man
upon
the
point
of
the
elbow
his
arm
was
flung
up
the
pistol
exploded
and
then
dropped
onto
the
floor
that
assailant
was
for
the
time
out
of
action
but
at
the
same
moment
the
lackey
came
running
across
the
floor
his
shoulders
thrust
forward
a
knife
in
his
hand
wogan
had
just
time
to
notice
that
the
lackey
coat
was
open
at
his
breast
he
stood
up
leaned
over
the
table
caught
the
lapels
one
in
each
hand
as
the
fellow
rushed
at
him
and
lifting
the
coat
up
off
his
shoulders
violently
jammed
it
backwards
down
his
arms
as
though
he
would
strip
him
of
it
the
lackey
stood
with
his
arms
pinioned
at
his
elbows
for
a
second
during
that
second
wogan
drew
his
hunting
knife
from
his
belt
and
drove
it
with
a
terrible
strength
into
the
man
chest
there
a
new
year
gift
for
your
mistress
the
countess
of
berg
cried
wogan
and
the
lackey
swung
round
with
the
force
of
the
blow
and
then
hopped
twice
in
a
horrible
fashion
with
his
feet
together
across
the
room
as
though
returning
to
his
place
and
fell
upon
the
floor
where
he
lay
twisting
the
polite
man
was
nursing
his
elbow
in
a
corner
there
were
three
others
left
the
man
with
the
cheery
voice
who
had
no
weapon
but
a
knobbed
stick
and
the
companions
on
the
settle
these
two
had
swords
and
had
drawn
them
they
leaped
over
the
lackey
body
and
rushed
at
wogan
one
a
little
in
advance
of
the
other
wogan
tilted
the
heavy
table
and
flung
it
over
to
make
a
barricade
in
front
of
him
it
fell
with
a
crash
and
the
lower
rim
struck
upon
the
instep
of
the
leader
and
pinned
his
foot
his
companion
drew
back
he
himself
uttered
a
cry
and
wrenched
at
his
foot
wogan
with
his
left
hand
drew
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
and
with
the
same
movement
passed
it
through
his
opponent
body
the
man
stood
swaying
pinned
there
by
his
foot
and
held
erect
then
he
made
one
desperate
lunge
fell
forward
across
the
barricade
and
hung
there
wogan
parried
the
lunge
the
sword
fell
from
the
man
hand
and
clattered
onto
the
floor
within
the
barricade
wogan
stamped
upon
it
with
his
heel
and
snapped
the
blade
he
had
still
two
opponents
and
as
they
advanced
again
he
suddenly
sprung
onto
the
edge
of
the
table
gave
one
sweeping
cut
in
a
circle
with
his
sword
and
darted
across
the
room
the
two
men
gave
ground
wogan
passed
between
them
before
they
could
strike
at
his
back
he
was
facing
them
again
he
had
no
longer
his
barricade
but
on
the
other
hand
his
shoulders
were
against
the
door
the
swordsman
crossed
blades
with
him
and
at
the
first
pass
wogan
realised
with
dismay
that
his
enemy
was
a
swordsman
in
knowledge
as
well
as
in
the
possession
of
the
weapon
he
had
a
fencer
suppleness
of
wrist
and
balance
of
body
he
pressed
wogan
hard
and
without
flurry
the
blade
of
his
sword
made
glittering
rings
about
wogan
and
the
point
struck
at
his
breast
like
an
adder
wogan
was
engaged
with
his
equal
if
not
with
his
better
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
with
one
man
and
he
would
have
to
fight
for
it
with
two
nay
with
three
for
over
his
opponent
shoulder
he
saw
his
first
polite
antagonist
cross
to
the
table
and
pick
up
from
the
ground
the
broken
sword
one
small
consolation
wogan
had
the
fellow
picked
it
up
with
his
left
hand
his
right
elbow
was
still
useless
but
even
that
consolation
lasted
him
for
no
long
time
for
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
could
see
the
big
fellow
creeping
up
with
his
stick
raised
along
the
wall
at
his
right
wogan
suddenly
pressed
upon
his
opponent
delivering
thrust
upon
thrust
and
forced
him
to
give
ground
as
the
swordsman
drew
back
wogan
swept
his
weapon
round
and
slashed
at
the
man
upon
his
right
but
the
stroke
was
wide
of
its
mark
and
the
big
man
struck
at
the
sword
with
his
stick
struck
with
all
his
might
so
that
wogan
arm
tingled
from
the
wrist
to
the
shoulder
that
however
was
the
least
part
of
the
damage
the
stick
did
it
broke
wogan
sword
short
off
at
the
hilt
both
men
gave
a
cry
of
delight
wogan
dropped
the
hilt
i
have
a
loaded
pistol
my
friends
you
have
forgotten
that
he
cried
and
plucked
the
pistol
from
his
belt
at
the
same
moment
he
felt
behind
him
with
his
left
hand
for
the
knob
of
the
door
he
fired
at
the
swordsman
and
his
pistol
missed
he
flung
it
at
the
man
with
the
stick
and
as
he
flung
it
he
sprang
to
the
right
threw
open
the
door
darted
into
the
passage
and
slammed
the
door
to
it
was
the
work
of
a
second
the
men
sprang
at
him
as
he
opened
the
door
as
he
slammed
it
close
a
pierced
the
thin
panel
and
bit
like
a
searing
iron
into
his
shoulder
wogan
uttered
a
cry
he
heard
an
answering
shout
in
the
room
he
clung
to
the
handle
setting
his
foot
against
the
wall
and
was
then
stabbed
in
the
back
for
his
host
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
passage
wogan
dropped
the
and
turned
that
last
blow
had
thrown
him
into
a
violent
rage
possessed
by
rage
he
was
no
longer
conscious
of
wounds
or
danger
he
was
conscious
only
of
superhuman
strength
the
knife
was
already
lifted
to
strike
again
wogan
seized
the
wrist
which
held
the
knife
grappled
with
the
innkeeper
and
caught
him
about
the
body
the
door
of
the
room
now
behind
him
was
flung
violently
open
wogan
who
was
wrought
to
a
frenzy
lifted
up
the
man
he
wrestled
with
and
swinging
round
hurled
him
headlong
through
the
doorway
the
three
men
were
already
on
the
threshold
the
new
missile
bounded
against
them
tumbled
them
one
against
the
other
and
knocked
them
sprawling
and
struggling
on
the
floor
wogan
burst
into
a
laugh
of
exultation
he
saw
his
most
dangerous
enemy
striving
to
disentangle
himself
and
his
sword
aha
my
friend
he
cried
you
handle
a
sword
very
prettily
but
i
am
the
better
man
at
and
shutting
the
door
to
be
ran
down
the
passage
into
the
road
he
had
seen
a
house
that
afternoon
with
a
high
garden
wall
about
it
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
wogan
ran
towards
it
the
mist
was
still
thick
but
he
now
began
to
feel
his
strength
failing
he
was
wounded
in
the
shoulder
he
was
stabbed
in
the
back
and
from
both
wounds
the
blood
was
flowing
warm
moreover
he
looked
backwards
once
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
a
lantern
dancing
in
the
road
he
kept
doggedly
running
though
his
pace
slackened
he
heard
a
shout
and
an
answering
shout
behind
him
he
stumbled
onto
his
knees
picked
himself
up
and
staggered
on
labouring
his
breath
dizzy
he
stumbled
again
and
fell
but
as
he
fell
he
struck
against
the
sharp
corner
of
the
wall
if
he
could
find
an
entrance
into
the
garden
beyond
that
wall
he
turned
off
the
road
to
the
left
and
ran
across
a
field
keeping
close
along
the
side
of
the
wall
he
came
to
another
corner
and
turned
to
the
right
as
he
turned
he
heard
voices
in
the
road
the
pursuers
had
stopped
and
were
searching
with
the
lantern
for
traces
of
his
passage
he
ran
along
the
back
of
the
wall
feeling
for
a
projection
a
tree
anything
which
would
enable
him
to
climb
it
the
wall
was
smooth
and
though
the
branches
of
trees
swung
and
creaked
above
his
head
their
stems
grew
in
the
garden
upon
the
other
side
he
was
pouring
with
sweat
his
breath
whistled
in
his
ears
he
had
the
sound
of
innumerable
armies
marching
across
the
earth
but
he
stumbled
on
and
at
last
though
his
right
side
brushed
against
the
wall
he
none
the
less
struck
against
it
also
with
his
chest
he
was
too
dazed
for
the
moment
to
understand
what
had
happened
all
the
breath
he
had
left
was
knocked
clean
out
of
his
body
he
dropped
in
a
huddle
on
the
ground
in
a
little
he
recovered
his
breath
he
listened
and
could
no
longer
hear
any
sound
of
voices
he
began
to
consider
he
reached
a
hand
out
in
front
of
him
and
touched
the
wall
he
reached
out
a
hand
to
the
right
of
him
and
touched
the
wall
again
the
wall
projected
then
abruptly
and
made
a
right
angle
now
wogan
had
spent
his
boyhood
at
rathcoffey
among
cliffs
and
rocks
this
wall
he
reflected
could
not
be
more
than
twelve
feet
high
would
his
strength
last
out
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
must
he
took
off
his
heavy
boots
and
flung
them
one
by
one
over
the
wall
then
he
pulled
off
his
coat
at
the
cost
of
some
pain
and
an
added
weakness
for
the
coat
was
stuck
to
his
wounds
and
had
roughly
staunched
them
he
could
feel
the
blood
again
soaking
his
shirt
there
was
all
the
more
need
then
for
hurry
he
stood
up
jammed
his
back
into
the
angle
of
the
wall
stretched
out
his
arms
on
each
side
pressing
with
his
elbows
and
hands
and
then
bending
his
knees
crossed
his
legs
tailor
fashion
and
set
the
soles
of
his
stockinged
feet
firmly
against
the
bricks
on
each
side
he
was
thus
seated
as
it
were
upon
nothing
but
retaining
his
position
by
the
pressure
of
his
arms
and
feet
and
his
whole
body
still
retaining
this
position
very
slowly
very
laboriously
he
worked
himself
up
the
angle
stopping
now
and
then
to
regain
his
breath
now
and
then
slipping
back
an
inch
but
he
mounted
towards
the
top
and
after
a
while
the
back
of
his
head
no
longer
touched
the
bricks
his
head
was
above
the
coping
of
the
wall
it
was
at
this
moment
that
he
saw
the
lantern
again
just
at
the
corner
where
he
had
turned
the
lantern
advanced
slowly
it
was
now
held
aloft
now
close
to
the
ground
wogan
was
very
glad
he
had
thrown
his
boots
and
coat
into
the
garden
he
made
a
few
last
desperate
struggles
he
could
now
place
the
palms
of
his
hands
behind
him
upon
the
coping
and
he
hoisted
himself
up
and
sat
on
the
wall
the
lantern
was
nearer
to
him
he
lay
flat
upon
his
face
on
the
coping
and
then
lowering
himself
upon
the
garden
side
to
the
full
length
of
his
arms
he
let
go
he
fell
into
a
litter
of
dead
leaves
very
soft
and
comfortable
he
would
not
have
exchanged
them
at
that
moment
for
the
emperor
own
bed
he
lay
upon
his
back
and
saw
the
dark
branches
above
his
head
grow
bright
and
green
his
pursuers
were
flashing
their
lantern
on
the
other
side
there
was
only
the
thickness
of
the
wall
between
him
and
them
he
could
even
hear
them
whispering
and
the
brushing
of
their
feet
he
lay
still
as
a
mouse
and
then
the
earth
heaved
up
and
fell
away
altogether
beneath
him
wogan
had
fainted
chapter
vii
it
was
still
night
when
wogan
opened
his
eyes
but
the
night
was
now
clear
of
mist
there
was
no
moon
however
to
give
him
a
guess
at
the
hour
he
lay
upon
his
back
among
the
dead
leaves
and
looking
upwards
at
the
stars
caught
as
it
seemed
in
a
of
branches
floated
back
into
consciousness
he
moved
and
the
movement
turned
him
sick
with
pain
the
knowledge
of
his
wounds
came
to
him
and
brought
with
it
a
clear
recollection
of
the
last
three
nights
the
black
strip
in
the
door
on
the
first
night
the
clutch
at
his
throat
and
the
leap
from
the
cupboard
on
the
second
the
silent
watching
of
those
five
pairs
of
eyes
on
the
third
and
the
lackey
with
the
knife
in
his
breast
hopping
with
both
feet
horribly
across
the
floor
the
horror
of
these
recollections
swept
in
upon
him
and
changed
him
from
a
man
into
a
timorous
child
he
lay
and
shuddered
until
in
every
creak
of
the
branches
he
heard
the
whisper
of
an
enemy
in
every
flutter
of
leaves
across
the
lawn
a
stealthy
footstep
and
behind
every
he
caught
the
flap
of
a
cloak
stiff
and
sore
he
raised
himself
from
the
ground
he
groped
for
his
boots
and
coat
and
putting
them
on
moved
cautiously
through
the
trees
supporting
himself
from
stem
to
stem
he
came
to
the
borders
of
a
wide
smooth
lawn
and
on
the
farther
side
stood
the
house
a
long
house
with
level
tiers
of
windows
stretching
to
the
right
and
the
left
and
a
bowed
tower
in
the
middle
through
one
of
the
windows
in
the
wogan
saw
the
spark
of
a
lamp
and
about
that
window
a
fan
of
yellow
light
was
spread
upon
the
lawn
wogan
at
this
moment
felt
in
great
need
of
companionship
he
stole
across
the
lawn
and
looked
into
the
room
an
old
gentleman
with
a
delicate
face
who
wore
his
own
white
hair
was
bending
over
a
book
at
a
desk
the
room
was
warmly
furnished
the
door
of
the
stove
stood
open
and
wogan
could
see
the
logs
blazing
merrily
a
chill
wind
swept
across
the
lawn
very
drear
and
ghostly
wogan
crept
closer
to
the
window
a
great
rose
at
the
old
man
feet
and
growled
then
the
old
man
rose
and
crossing
to
the
window
pressed
his
face
against
the
panes
with
his
hands
curved
about
his
eyes
wogan
stepped
forward
and
stood
within
the
fan
of
light
spreading
out
his
arms
to
show
that
he
came
as
a
supplicant
and
with
no
ill
intent
the
old
man
with
a
word
to
his
hound
opened
the
window
who
is
it
he
asked
and
with
a
thrill
not
of
fear
but
of
expectation
in
his
voice
a
man
wounded
and
in
sore
straits
for
his
life
who
would
gladly
sit
for
a
few
minutes
by
your
fire
before
he
goes
upon
his
way
the
old
man
stood
aside
and
wogan
entered
the
room
he
was
spattered
from
head
to
foot
with
mud
his
clothes
were
torn
his
eyes
sunken
his
face
was
of
a
ghastly
pallor
and
marked
with
blood
i
am
the
chevalier
warner
said
wogan
a
gentleman
of
ireland
you
will
pardon
me
but
i
have
gone
through
so
much
these
last
three
nights
that
i
can
barely
stand
and
dropping
into
a
chair
he
dragged
it
up
to
the
door
of
the
stove
and
crouched
there
shivering
the
old
man
closed
the
window
i
am
count
otto
von
ahlen
and
in
my
house
you
are
safe
as
you
are
welcome
he
went
to
a
sideboard
and
filling
a
glass
carried
it
to
wogan
the
liquor
was
brandy
wogan
drank
it
as
though
it
had
been
so
much
water
he
was
in
that
condition
of
fatigue
when
the
most
extraordinary
events
seem
altogether
commonplace
and
natural
but
as
he
felt
the
spirit
warming
his
blood
he
became
aware
of
the
great
difference
between
his
battered
appearance
and
that
of
the
old
gentleman
with
the
rich
dress
and
the
white
linen
who
stooped
so
hospitably
above
him
and
he
began
to
wonder
at
the
readiness
of
the
hospitality
wogan
might
have
been
a
thief
a
murderer
for
all
count
otto
knew
yet
the
count
with
no
other
protection
than
his
dog
had
opened
his
window
and
at
that
late
hour
of
the
night
had
welcomed
him
without
a
word
of
a
question
sir
said
wogan
my
visit
is
the
most
unceremonious
thing
in
the
world
i
plump
in
upon
you
in
the
dark
of
the
morning
as
i
take
it
to
be
and
disturb
you
at
your
books
without
so
much
as
knocking
at
the
door
it
is
as
well
you
did
not
knock
at
the
door
returned
the
count
for
my
servants
are
long
since
in
bed
and
your
knock
would
very
likely
have
reached
neither
their
ears
nor
mine
and
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
opposite
to
wogan
bending
forward
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
the
firelight
played
upon
his
pale
indoor
face
and
it
seemed
to
wogan
that
he
regarded
his
guest
with
a
certain
wistfulness
wogan
spoke
his
thought
aloud
yet
i
might
be
any
hedgerow
rascal
with
a
taste
for
your
plate
and
no
particular
scruples
as
to
a
life
or
two
lying
in
the
way
of
its
gratification
the
count
smiled
your
visit
is
not
so
unexampled
as
you
are
inclined
to
think
nearly
thirty
years
ago
a
young
man
as
you
are
came
in
just
such
a
plight
as
you
and
stood
outside
this
window
at
two
of
a
dark
morning
even
so
early
in
my
life
i
was
at
my
books
and
he
smiled
rather
sadly
i
let
him
in
and
he
talked
to
me
for
an
hour
of
matters
strange
and
dreamlike
and
enviable
to
me
i
have
never
forgotten
that
hour
nor
to
tell
the
truth
have
i
ever
ceased
to
envy
the
man
who
talked
to
me
during
it
though
many
years
since
he
suffered
a
dreadful
doom
and
vanished
from
among
his
fellows
i
shall
be
glad
therefore
to
hear
your
story
if
you
have
a
mind
to
tell
it
me
the
young
man
who
came
upon
that
other
night
was
count
philip
christopher
von
königsmarck
wogan
started
at
the
mention
of
this
name
it
seemed
strange
that
that
fitful
and
brilliant
man
whose
brief
passionate
guilty
life
and
mysterious
end
had
made
so
much
noise
in
the
world
had
crossed
that
lawn
and
stood
before
that
window
at
just
such
an
hour
and
maybe
had
sat
shivering
in
wogan
very
chair
i
have
no
such
story
as
count
philip
von
königsmarck
no
doubt
had
to
tell
said
wogan
chevalier
said
count
otto
with
a
nod
of
approval
königsmarck
had
the
like
reticence
though
he
was
not
always
so
discreet
i
fear
the
princess
sophia
dorothea
was
at
that
time
on
a
visit
to
the
duke
of
würtemberg
at
the
palace
in
stuttgart
but
königsmarck
told
me
only
that
he
had
snatched
a
breathing
space
from
the
wars
in
the
low
countries
and
was
bound
thither
again
rumour
told
me
afterwards
of
his
fatal
attachment
he
sat
where
you
sit
chevalier
wounded
as
you
are
a
fugitive
from
pursuit
even
the
stains
and
disorder
of
his
plight
could
not
disguise
the
singular
beauty
of
the
man
or
make
one
insensible
to
the
charm
of
his
manner
but
i
forget
my
duties
and
he
rose
it
would
be
as
well
no
doubt
if
i
did
not
wake
my
servants
he
suggested
count
otto
returned
wogan
with
a
smile
they
have
their
day
work
the
old
man
nodded
and
taking
a
lamp
from
a
table
by
the
door
went
out
of
the
room
wogan
remained
alone
the
dog
nuzzled
at
his
hand
but
it
seemed
to
wogan
that
there
was
another
in
the
room
besides
himself
and
the
dog
the
sleeplessness
and
tension
of
the
last
few
days
the
fatigue
of
his
arduous
journey
the
fever
of
his
wounds
no
doubt
had
their
effect
upon
him
he
felt
that
königsmarck
was
at
his
side
his
eyes
could
almost
discern
a
shadowy
and
beautiful
figure
his
ears
could
almost
hear
a
musical
vibrating
voice
and
the
voice
warned
him
in
some
strange
unaccountable
way
the
voice
warned
and
menaced
him
i
fought
i
climbed
that
wall
i
crossed
the
lawn
i
took
refuge
here
for
love
of
a
queen
for
love
of
a
queen
all
my
short
life
i
lived
for
love
of
a
queen
i
died
most
horribly
and
the
queen
lives
though
it
would
have
gone
better
with
her
had
she
died
as
horribly
wogan
had
once
seen
the
lonely
castle
of
ahlden
where
that
queen
was
imprisoned
he
had
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
driving
in
the
dusk
across
the
heath
surrounded
by
her
guards
with
their
flashing
swords
he
sat
chilled
with
apprehensions
and
forebodings
they
crowded
in
upon
his
mind
all
the
more
terrible
because
he
could
not
translate
them
into
definite
perils
which
beyond
this
and
that
corner
of
his
life
might
await
him
he
was
the
victim
of
illusions
he
assured
himself
at
which
safe
in
schlestadt
he
would
laugh
but
the
illusions
were
real
königsmarck
was
with
him
königsmarck
was
by
some
mysterious
alchemy
becoming
incorporate
with
him
the
voice
which
spoke
and
warned
and
menaced
was
as
much
his
as
königsmarck
the
old
count
opened
the
door
and
heard
wogan
muttering
to
himself
as
he
crouched
over
the
fire
the
count
carried
a
basin
of
water
in
his
hand
and
a
sponge
and
some
linen
he
insisted
upon
washing
wogan
wounds
and
dressing
them
in
a
simple
way
they
are
not
deep
he
said
a
few
days
rest
and
a
clever
surgeon
will
restore
you
he
went
from
the
room
again
and
brought
back
a
tray
on
which
were
the
remains
of
a
pie
a
loaf
of
bread
and
some
fruit
while
you
eat
chevalier
i
will
mix
you
a
cordial
said
he
and
he
set
about
his
hospitable
work
you
ask
me
why
i
so
readily
opened
my
window
to
you
it
was
because
i
took
you
for
königsmarck
himself
come
back
as
mysteriously
as
he
disappeared
i
did
not
think
that
if
he
came
back
now
his
hair
would
be
as
white
his
shoulders
as
bent
as
mine
indeed
one
can
not
think
of
königsmarck
except
as
a
youth
you
had
the
very
look
of
him
as
you
stood
in
the
light
upon
the
lawn
you
have
if
i
may
say
so
something
of
his
gallant
bearing
and
something
of
his
grace
wogan
could
have
heard
no
words
more
distressing
to
him
at
this
moment
oh
stop
sir
i
pray
you
stop
he
cried
out
violently
and
noting
the
instant
he
had
spoken
the
surprise
on
count
otto
face
there
sir
i
give
you
at
once
by
my
discourtesy
an
example
of
how
little
i
merit
a
comparison
with
that
courtly
nobleman
let
me
repair
it
by
telling
you
since
you
are
willing
to
hear
of
my
night
adventure
and
as
he
ate
he
told
his
story
omitting
the
precise
object
of
his
journey
the
nature
of
the
letter
which
he
had
burned
and
any
name
which
might
give
a
clue
to
the
secret
of
his
enterprise
the
count
otto
listened
with
his
eyes
as
well
as
his
ears
he
hung
upon
the
words
shuddering
at
each
danger
that
sprang
upon
wogan
exclaiming
in
wonder
at
the
shift
by
which
he
escaped
from
it
and
at
times
he
looked
over
towards
his
books
with
a
glance
of
veritable
dislike
to
feel
the
blood
run
hot
in
one
veins
to
be
bedfellows
with
peril
to
go
gallantly
forward
hand
in
hand
with
endeavour
he
mused
and
broke
off
see
i
own
a
sword
being
a
gentleman
but
it
is
a
toy
an
ornament
it
stands
over
there
in
the
corner
from
day
to
day
and
my
servants
clean
it
from
rust
as
they
will
now
you
sir
i
suppose
my
horse
and
my
sword
count
said
wogan
when
the
pinch
comes
they
are
one
only
servants
it
would
be
an
ill
business
if
i
did
not
see
to
their
wants
the
old
man
was
silent
for
a
while
then
he
said
timidly
it
was
for
a
woman
no
doubt
that
you
ran
this
hazard
for
a
woman
yes
the
count
folded
his
hands
and
leaned
forward
sir
a
woman
is
a
strange
inexplicable
thing
to
me
their
words
their
looks
their
graceful
delicate
shapes
the
motives
which
persuade
them
the
thoughts
which
their
eyes
conceal
all
these
qualities
make
them
beings
of
another
world
to
me
i
do
envy
men
at
times
who
can
stand
beside
them
talk
with
them
without
fear
be
intimate
with
them
and
understand
their
intricate
thoughts
are
there
such
men
asked
wogan
men
who
love
such
as
count
königsmarck
and
yourself
wogan
held
up
his
hand
with
a
cry
count
such
men
we
are
told
are
the
blindest
of
all
did
not
königsmarck
prove
it
as
for
myself
not
even
in
that
respect
can
i
be
ranked
with
königsmarck
i
am
a
mere
whose
is
a
clash
of
steel
but
this
risk
you
ran
you
told
me
it
was
for
a
woman
for
a
woman
yes
for
love
of
a
woman
no
no
no
he
exclaimed
with
surprising
violence
then
he
rose
from
his
chair
but
i
have
stayed
my
time
said
he
you
have
never
had
a
more
grateful
guest
i
beg
you
to
believe
it
count
otto
barely
heard
the
words
he
was
absorbed
in
the
fanciful
dreams
born
of
many
long
solitary
evenings
and
like
most
timid
and
uncommunicative
men
he
made
his
confidence
in
a
momentary
enthusiasm
to
a
stranger
königsmarck
spoke
for
an
hour
mentioning
no
names
so
that
i
who
from
my
youth
have
lived
apart
could
not
make
a
guess
he
spoke
with
a
deal
of
passion
it
seemed
that
one
hour
his
life
was
paradise
and
the
next
a
hell
even
as
he
spoke
he
was
one
instant
all
faith
and
the
next
all
despair
one
moment
he
was
filled
with
his
unworthiness
and
wonder
that
so
noble
a
creature
as
a
woman
should
bend
her
heart
and
lips
from
her
heaven
down
to
his
earth
the
next
he
could
not
conceive
any
man
should
be
such
a
witless
ass
as
to
stake
his
happiness
on
the
steadiness
of
so
manifest
a
weathercock
as
a
woman
favour
it
was
all
very
strange
talk
it
opened
to
me
just
as
when
a
fog
lifts
and
rolls
down
again
a
momentary
vision
of
a
world
of
colours
in
which
i
had
no
share
and
to
tell
the
truth
it
left
me
with
a
suspicion
which
has
recurred
again
and
again
that
all
my
solitary
years
over
my
books
all
the
delights
which
the
delicate
turning
of
a
phrase
or
the
chase
and
capture
of
an
elusive
idea
can
bring
to
one
may
not
be
worth
after
all
one
single
minute
of
living
passion
passion
chevalier
there
is
a
word
of
which
i
know
the
meaning
only
by
hearsay
but
i
wonder
at
times
whatever
harm
it
works
whether
there
can
be
any
great
thing
without
it
but
you
are
anxious
to
go
forward
upon
your
way
he
again
took
up
his
lamp
and
requesting
wogan
to
follow
him
unlatched
the
window
wogan
however
did
not
move
i
am
wondering
said
he
whether
i
might
be
yet
deeper
in
your
debt
i
left
behind
me
a
sword
count
otto
set
his
lamp
down
and
took
a
sword
from
the
corner
of
the
room
i
called
it
an
ornament
and
yet
in
other
hands
it
might
well
prove
a
serviceable
weapon
the
blade
is
of
spanish
steel
you
will
honour
me
by
wearing
it
wogan
was
in
two
minds
with
regard
to
the
count
on
the
one
hand
he
was
most
grateful
on
the
other
he
could
not
but
think
that
over
his
books
he
had
fallen
into
a
sickly
way
of
thought
he
was
quite
ready
however
to
wear
his
sword
moreover
when
he
had
hooked
the
hanger
to
his
belt
he
looked
about
the
room
i
had
a
pistol
he
said
carelessly
a
very
useful
thing
is
a
pistol
more
useful
at
times
than
a
sword
i
keep
one
in
my
bedroom
said
the
count
setting
the
lamp
down
if
you
can
wait
the
few
moments
it
will
take
me
to
fetch
it
wogan
was
quite
able
to
wait
he
was
indeed
sufficiently
generous
to
tell
count
otto
that
he
need
not
hurry
the
count
fetched
the
pistol
and
took
up
the
lamp
again
will
you
now
follow
me
wogan
looked
straight
before
him
into
the
air
and
spoke
to
no
one
in
particular
a
pistol
is
to
be
sure
more
useful
than
a
sword
but
there
is
just
one
thing
more
useful
on
an
occasion
than
a
pistol
and
that
is
a
hunting
knife
count
otto
shook
his
head
there
chevalier
i
doubt
if
i
can
serve
you
but
upon
my
word
said
wogan
picking
up
a
from
the
tray
here
is
the
very
thing
it
has
no
sheath
wogan
was
almost
indignant
at
the
suggestion
that
he
would
go
so
far
as
to
ask
even
his
dearest
friend
for
a
sheath
besides
he
had
a
sheath
and
he
fitted
the
knife
into
it
now
said
he
pleasantly
all
that
i
need
is
a
sound
swift
thoroughbred
horse
about
six
or
seven
years
old
count
otto
for
the
fourth
time
took
up
his
lamp
will
you
follow
me
he
said
for
the
fourth
time
wogan
followed
the
old
man
across
the
lawn
and
round
a
corner
of
the
house
until
he
came
to
a
long
low
building
surmounted
by
a
cupola
the
building
was
the
stable
and
the
count
otto
roused
one
of
his
grooms
saddle
me
flavia
said
he
flavia
is
a
mare
who
i
fancy
fulfils
your
requirements
wogan
had
no
complaint
to
make
of
her
she
had
the
manners
of
a
courtier
it
seemed
too
that
she
had
no
complaint
to
make
of
wogan
count
otto
laid
his
hand
upon
the
bridle
and
led
the
mare
with
her
rider
along
a
lane
through
a
thicket
of
trees
and
to
a
small
gate
here
then
we
part
chevalier
said
he
no
doubt
i
shall
sit
down
at
my
table
knowing
that
i
talked
a
deal
of
folly
ill
befitting
an
old
man
no
doubt
i
shall
be
aware
that
my
books
are
the
true
happiness
after
all
but
well
i
would
fain
be
twenty
years
of
age
that
i
might
fling
my
books
over
the
hedge
and
ride
out
with
you
my
sword
at
my
side
my
courage
in
my
hand
into
the
world
highway
i
will
beg
you
to
keep
the
mare
as
a
token
and
a
memory
of
our
meeting
there
is
no
better
beast
i
believe
in
christendom
wogan
was
touched
by
the
old
gentleman
warmth
count
said
wogan
i
will
gladly
keep
your
mare
in
remembrance
of
your
great
goodwill
to
a
stranger
but
there
is
one
better
beast
in
christendom
indeed
and
which
is
that
why
sir
the
black
horse
which
the
lady
i
shall
marry
will
ride
into
my
city
of
dreams
and
so
he
rode
off
upon
his
way
the
morning
was
just
beginning
to
gleam
pale
in
the
east
here
was
a
night
passed
which
he
had
not
thought
to
live
through
and
he
was
still
alive
to
help
the
chosen
woman
imprisoned
in
the
hollow
of
the
hills
at
innspruck
wogan
had
reason
to
be
grateful
to
that
old
man
who
stood
straining
his
eyes
after
him
there
was
something
pathetical
in
his
discontent
with
his
secluded
life
which
touched
wogan
to
the
heart
wogan
was
not
sure
that
in
the
morning
the
old
man
would
know
that
the
part
he
had
chosen
was
after
all
the
best
besides
wogan
had
between
his
knees
the
most
friendly
and
intelligent
beast
which
he
had
ridden
since
that
morning
when
he
met
lady
featherstone
on
the
road
to
bologna
but
he
had
soon
other
matters
to
distract
his
thoughts
however
easily
flavia
cantered
or
trotted
she
could
not
but
sharply
remind
him
of
his
wounds
he
had
forty
miles
to
travel
before
he
could
reach
schlestadt
and
in
the
villages
on
the
road
there
was
gossip
that
day
of
a
man
with
a
tormented
face
who
rode
rocking
in
his
saddle
as
though
the
furies
were
at
his
back
chapter
viii
the
little
town
of
schlestadt
went
to
bed
betimes
by
ten
its
burghers
were
in
their
a
belated
visitor
going
home
at
that
hour
found
his
footsteps
ring
upon
the
pavement
with
surprising
echoes
and
traversed
dark
street
after
dark
street
seeing
in
each
window
perhaps
a
mimic
moon
but
no
other
light
unless
his
path
chanced
to
lie
through
herzogstrasse
in
that
street
a
couple
of
windows
on
the
first
floor
showed
bright
and
unabashed
and
the
curious
could
detect
upon
the
blind
the
shadows
of
men
growing
to
monstrous
giants
and
dwindling
to
pigmies
according
as
they
approached
or
retired
from
the
lamp
in
the
room
there
were
three
men
in
that
room
booted
as
for
a
journey
their
dress
might
have
misled
one
into
the
belief
that
they
were
merchants
but
their
manner
of
wearing
it
proclaimed
them
soldiers
of
the
three
one
a
short
spare
man
sat
at
the
table
with
his
head
bent
over
a
slip
of
paper
his
peruke
was
pushed
back
from
his
forehead
and
showed
that
the
hair
about
his
temples
was
grey
he
had
a
square
face
of
some
strength
and
thoughtful
eyes
the
second
of
the
three
stood
by
the
window
he
was
perhaps
a
few
years
younger
an
observer
might
have
guessed
to
the
forty
and
his
face
revealed
a
character
quite
different
his
features
were
sharp
his
eyes
quick
if
prudence
was
the
predominating
quality
of
the
first
resource
took
its
place
in
the
second
while
the
first
man
sat
patiently
at
the
table
this
one
stood
impatiently
at
the
window
now
he
lifted
the
blind
now
he
dropped
it
again
the
third
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
with
his
face
upturned
to
the
ceiling
he
was
a
tall
big
man
with
mighty
legs
which
sprawled
one
on
each
side
of
the
hearth
he
was
the
youngest
of
the
three
by
five
years
but
his
forehead
at
this
moment
was
so
creased
his
mouth
so
pursed
up
his
cheeks
so
wrinkled
he
had
the
look
of
sixty
years
he
puffed
and
breathed
very
heavily
once
or
twice
he
sighed
and
at
each
sigh
his
chair
creaked
under
him
major
of
dillon
regiment
was
thinking
gaydon
said
he
suddenly
the
man
at
the
table
looked
up
quickly
misset
the
man
at
the
window
turned
impatiently
i
have
an
idea
misset
shrugged
his
shoulders
gaydon
said
let
us
hear
it
drew
himself
up
his
chair
no
longer
creaked
it
groaned
and
cracked
it
is
a
lottery
said
he
and
we
have
made
our
fortunes
we
three
are
the
winners
and
so
our
names
are
not
crossed
out
but
i
have
put
no
money
in
a
lottery
objected
gaydon
nor
i
said
misset
and
where
should
i
find
money
either
said
but
charles
wogan
has
borrowed
it
for
us
and
paid
it
in
and
so
we
all
rich
men
what
i
buy
with
it
misset
paced
the
room
the
paper
came
four
days
ago
he
said
yes
in
the
morning
five
days
then
and
he
stood
listening
then
he
ran
to
the
window
and
opened
it
gaydon
followed
him
and
drew
up
the
blind
both
men
listened
and
were
puzzled
that
the
sound
of
horseshoes
said
gaydon
but
there
another
sound
keeping
pace
with
the
horseshoes
said
misset
leaned
on
their
shoulders
crushing
them
both
down
upon
the
sill
of
the
window
it
is
very
like
the
sound
a
gentleman
makes
when
he
reels
home
from
a
tavern
gaydon
and
misset
raised
themselves
with
a
common
effort
springing
from
a
common
thought
and
shot
back
into
the
room
what
if
it
is
began
misset
he
was
never
drunk
in
his
life
said
gaydon
it
possible
that
he
has
reformed
said
and
the
three
men
precipitated
themselves
down
the
stairs
the
drunkard
was
wogan
he
was
drunk
with
fatigue
and
sleeplessness
and
pain
but
he
had
retained
just
enough
of
his
sober
nature
to
spare
a
tired
mare
who
had
that
day
served
him
well
the
first
intimation
he
received
that
his
friends
were
on
the
watch
was
voice
bawling
down
the
street
to
him
is
it
a
lottery
tell
me
we
all
rich
men
and
he
felt
himself
grasped
in
arms
i
tell
you
more
wonderful
things
than
that
stammered
wogan
when
you
have
shown
me
the
way
to
a
stable
there
one
at
the
back
of
the
house
said
gaydon
i
take
the
horse
no
said
wogan
stubbornly
and
would
not
yield
the
bridle
to
gaydon
nodded
approval
there
are
two
things
said
he
a
man
never
trusts
to
his
friends
one
his
horse
t
other
his
wife
wogan
suddenly
stopped
and
looked
at
answered
the
look
loftily
it
is
a
little
maxim
of
philosophy
i
have
others
they
come
to
me
in
the
night
misset
laughed
wogan
walked
on
to
the
stable
it
was
a
long
building
and
a
light
was
still
burning
moreover
a
groom
was
awake
for
the
door
was
opened
before
they
had
come
near
enough
to
knock
there
were
twelve
stalls
of
which
nine
were
occupied
and
three
of
the
nine
horses
stood
ready
saddled
and
bridled
wogan
sat
down
upon
a
and
waited
while
his
mare
was
groomed
and
fed
the
mare
looked
round
once
or
twice
in
the
midst
of
her
meal
twisting
her
neck
as
far
as
her
halter
allowed
i
am
not
gone
yet
my
lady
said
he
take
your
time
wogan
made
a
ghostly
figure
in
the
dim
shadowy
light
his
face
was
of
an
extraordinary
pallor
his
teeth
chattered
his
eyes
burned
gaydon
looked
at
him
with
concern
and
said
to
the
groom
you
can
take
the
saddles
off
we
shall
need
no
horses
the
four
men
returned
to
the
house
wogan
went
upstairs
first
gaydon
held
back
the
other
two
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
not
a
word
not
a
question
till
he
has
eaten
or
we
shall
have
him
in
bed
for
a
twelvemonth
misset
do
you
run
for
a
doctor
see
what
you
can
find
in
the
larder
wogan
sat
before
the
fire
without
a
word
while
spread
the
table
and
set
a
couple
of
cold
partridges
upon
it
and
a
bottle
of
red
wine
wogan
ate
mechanically
for
a
little
and
afterwards
with
some
enjoyment
he
picked
the
partridges
till
the
bones
were
clean
and
he
finished
the
bottle
of
wine
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
sigh
of
something
very
like
to
contentment
and
felt
along
the
with
his
hands
however
had
foreseen
his
wants
and
handed
him
a
pipe
newly
filled
while
wogan
was
lighting
the
tobacco
misset
came
back
into
the
room
with
word
that
the
doctor
was
out
upon
his
last
rounds
but
would
come
as
soon
as
he
had
returned
home
the
four
men
sat
down
about
the
fire
and
wogan
reached
out
his
hand
and
felt
arm
it
is
you
he
said
there
you
are
the
three
of
you
my
good
friends
and
this
is
schlestadt
but
it
is
strange
and
he
laughed
a
little
to
himself
and
looked
about
the
room
assuring
himself
that
this
indeed
was
gaydon
lodging
you
received
a
slip
of
paper
said
he
four
days
back
said
gaydon
and
understood
that
we
were
to
be
ready
good
then
it
not
a
lottery
murmured
and
we
drawn
no
prizes
ah
but
we
are
going
to
cried
wogan
we
are
safe
here
no
one
can
hear
us
no
one
can
burst
in
but
i
am
sure
of
that
misset
knows
the
trick
that
will
make
us
safe
from
interruption
eh
misset
looked
blankly
at
wogan
why
one
can
turn
the
key
said
he
to
be
sure
said
wogan
with
a
laugh
of
admiration
for
that
device
of
which
he
had
bethought
himself
and
which
he
ascribed
to
misset
if
there
a
key
but
if
there
no
key
why
a
chair
tilted
against
the
door
to
catch
the
handle
eh
misset
locked
the
door
not
at
all
comprehending
that
device
and
returned
to
his
seat
we
are
to
draw
the
greatest
prize
that
ever
was
drawn
resumed
wogan
and
he
broke
off
but
is
there
a
cupboard
in
the
room
no
matter
i
forgot
that
this
is
gaydon
lodging
and
gaydon
not
the
man
to
overlook
a
cupboard
gaydon
jumped
up
from
his
chair
but
upon
my
word
there
is
a
cupboard
he
cried
and
crossing
to
a
corner
of
the
room
he
opened
a
door
and
looked
in
wogan
laughed
again
as
though
gaydon
examination
of
the
cupboard
was
a
very
good
joke
there
will
be
nobody
in
it
he
cried
gaydon
will
never
feel
a
hand
gripping
the
life
out
of
his
throat
because
he
forgot
to
search
a
cupboard
the
cupboard
was
empty
as
it
happened
but
gaydon
had
left
the
door
of
the
street
open
when
he
went
out
to
meet
wogan
there
had
been
time
and
to
spare
for
any
man
to
creep
upstairs
and
hide
himself
had
there
been
a
man
in
schlestadt
that
night
minded
to
hear
gaydon
returned
to
his
chair
we
are
to
draw
the
biggest
prize
in
all
europe
said
wogan
there
cried
will
you
be
pleased
to
remember
when
next
i
have
an
idea
that
i
was
right
but
not
for
ourselves
added
wogan
face
fell
oh
we
are
to
hand
it
on
to
a
third
party
said
he
yes
well
after
all
that
quite
of
a
piece
with
our
luck
who
is
the
third
party
asked
misset
the
king
misset
started
up
from
his
chair
and
leaned
forward
his
hands
upon
the
arms
the
king
said
to
be
sure
that
makes
a
difference
gaydon
asked
quietly
and
what
is
the
prize
the
princess
clementina
said
wogan
we
are
to
rescue
her
from
her
prison
in
innspruck
even
gaydon
was
startled
we
four
he
exclaimed
we
four
repeated
misset
staring
at
wogan
his
mouth
was
open
his
eyes
started
from
his
head
he
stammered
in
his
speech
we
four
against
a
nation
against
half
europe
simply
crossed
to
a
corner
of
the
room
picked
up
his
sword
and
buckled
it
to
his
waist
i
am
ready
said
he
wogan
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
smiled
i
know
that
said
he
so
are
we
all
all
ready
is
not
that
so
my
friends
we
four
are
ready
and
he
looked
to
misset
and
to
gaydon
here
an
exploit
if
we
but
carry
it
through
which
even
antiquity
will
be
at
pains
to
match
it
more
than
an
exploit
for
it
has
the
sanctity
of
a
crusade
on
the
one
side
there
tyranny
oppression
injustice
the
one
woman
who
most
deserves
a
crown
robbed
of
it
and
on
the
other
there
the
king
said
gaydon
and
the
three
brief
words
seemed
somehow
to
quench
and
sober
wogan
yes
said
he
there
the
king
and
we
four
to
serve
him
in
his
need
we
are
few
but
in
that
lies
our
one
hope
they
will
never
look
for
four
men
but
for
many
four
men
travelling
to
the
shrine
of
loretto
with
the
pope
passport
may
well
stay
at
innspruck
and
escape
a
close
attention
i
am
ready
repeated
but
we
shall
not
start
there
the
passport
to
be
got
a
plan
to
be
arranged
oh
there
a
plan
said
to
be
sure
there
always
a
plan
and
he
sat
down
again
heavily
as
though
he
put
no
faith
in
plans
misset
and
gaydon
drew
their
chairs
closer
to
wogan
and
instinctively
lowered
their
voices
to
the
tone
of
a
whisper
is
her
highness
warned
of
the
attempt
asked
gaydon
as
soon
as
i
obtained
the
king
permission
replied
wogan
i
hurried
to
innspruck
there
i
saw
chateaudoux
the
chamberlain
of
the
mother
here
is
a
letter
he
dropped
in
the
cathedral
for
me
to
pick
up
he
drew
the
letter
from
his
fob
and
handed
it
to
gaydon
gaydon
read
it
and
handed
it
to
misset
misset
nodded
and
handed
it
to
who
read
it
four
times
and
handed
it
back
to
gaydon
with
a
flourish
of
the
hand
as
though
the
matter
was
now
quite
plain
to
him
chateaudoux
has
a
sweetheart
said
he
sententiously
very
good
i
do
not
think
the
worse
of
him
gaydon
glanced
a
second
time
through
the
letter
the
princess
says
that
you
must
have
the
prince
sobieski
written
consent
i
went
from
innspruck
to
ohlau
said
wogan
i
had
some
trouble
and
the
reason
of
my
coming
leaked
out
the
countess
de
berg
suspected
it
from
the
first
she
had
a
friend
an
englishwoman
lady
featherstone
who
was
at
ohlau
to
outwit
me
lady
featherstone
said
misset
who
can
she
be
wogan
told
them
of
his
first
meeting
with
lady
featherstone
on
the
florence
road
but
he
knew
no
more
about
her
and
not
one
of
the
three
knew
anything
at
all
so
the
secret
out
said
gaydon
but
you
outstripped
it
barely
said
wogan
forty
miles
away
i
had
last
night
to
fight
for
my
life
but
you
have
the
prince
written
consent
said
misset
i
had
last
night
but
i
made
a
spill
of
it
to
light
my
pipe
there
were
six
men
against
me
had
that
been
found
on
my
dead
body
why
there
was
proof
positive
of
our
attempt
and
the
attempt
foiled
by
sure
safeguards
as
it
is
if
we
lie
still
a
little
while
their
fears
will
cease
and
the
rumour
become
discredited
misset
leaned
across
gaydon
arm
and
scanned
the
letter
but
her
highness
writes
most
clearly
she
will
not
move
without
that
sure
token
of
her
father
consent
wogan
drew
from
his
breast
pocket
a
made
from
a
single
turquoise
here
a
token
no
less
sure
it
was
prince
sobieski
new
year
gift
to
me
a
jewel
unique
and
in
an
unique
setting
this
must
persuade
her
his
father
great
king
john
of
poland
took
it
from
the
grand
tent
when
the
turks
were
routed
at
vienna
reached
out
his
hand
and
engulfed
the
jewel
sure
said
he
it
is
a
pretty
sort
of
toy
it
would
persuade
any
woman
to
anything
so
long
as
she
was
promised
it
to
hang
about
her
neck
you
must
promise
it
to
the
princess
but
not
give
it
to
her
no
lest
when
she
has
got
it
she
should
be
content
to
remain
in
innspruck
i
know
you
must
promise
it
wogan
bowed
to
wisdom
and
took
back
the
i
will
not
forget
to
promise
it
said
he
but
here
another
point
said
gaydon
her
highness
the
mother
insists
that
a
woman
shall
attend
upon
her
daughter
and
where
shall
we
find
a
woman
with
the
courage
and
the
strength
i
have
thought
of
that
said
wogan
misset
has
a
wife
by
the
luckiest
stroke
in
the
world
misset
took
a
wife
this
last
spring
there
was
at
once
a
complete
silence
gaydon
stared
into
the
fire
looked
with
intense
interest
at
the
ceiling
misset
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
wogan
was
filled
with
consternation
was
wife
dead
he
asked
himself
he
had
spoken
lightly
laughingly
and
he
went
hot
and
cold
as
he
recollected
the
raillery
of
his
words
he
sat
in
his
chair
shocked
at
the
pain
which
he
had
caused
his
friend
moreover
he
had
counted
surely
upon
misset
then
misset
raised
his
head
from
his
hands
and
in
a
trembling
voice
he
said
slowly
my
boy
would
only
live
to
serve
his
king
why
should
he
not
serve
his
king
before
he
lives
my
wife
will
say
the
like
there
was
a
depth
of
quiet
feeling
in
his
words
which
wogan
would
never
have
expected
from
misset
and
the
words
themselves
were
words
which
he
felt
no
man
no
king
however
much
beloved
however
generous
to
his
servants
had
any
right
to
expect
they
took
wogan
breath
away
and
not
wogan
only
but
gaydon
and
too
a
longer
silence
than
before
followed
upon
them
the
very
simplicity
with
which
they
had
been
uttered
was
startling
and
made
those
three
men
doubt
at
the
first
whether
they
had
heard
aright
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
there
never
was
a
father
since
adam
who
was
not
absolutely
sure
in
his
heart
that
his
must
be
a
boy
when
you
come
to
think
philosophically
about
it
you
see
that
if
fathers
had
their
way
the
world
would
be
peopled
with
sons
with
never
a
bit
of
a
lass
in
any
corner
to
marry
them
reflection
if
not
a
reason
for
laughter
made
a
pretext
for
it
at
which
all
even
misset
who
was
a
trifle
ashamed
of
his
display
of
feeling
eagerly
caught
wogan
held
his
hand
out
and
clasped
misset
that
was
a
great
saying
said
he
but
so
much
sacrifice
is
not
to
be
accepted
misset
however
was
firm
his
wife
he
said
though
naturally
timid
could
show
a
fine
spirit
on
occasion
and
would
never
forgive
one
of
them
if
she
was
left
behind
he
argued
until
a
compromise
was
reached
misset
should
lay
the
matter
openly
before
his
wife
and
the
four
crusaders
to
use
wogan
term
would
be
bound
by
her
decision
so
you
may
take
it
that
matter
settled
said
misset
there
will
be
five
of
us
six
said
wogan
there
another
man
to
join
us
then
said
gaydon
i
have
it
your
servant
marnier
no
not
marnier
nor
any
man
listen
it
is
necessary
that
when
once
her
highness
is
rescued
we
must
get
so
much
start
as
will
make
pursuit
vain
we
shall
be
hampered
with
a
coach
and
a
coach
will
travel
slowly
on
the
passes
of
tyrol
the
pursuers
will
ride
horses
they
must
not
come
up
with
us
from
innspruck
to
italy
if
we
have
never
an
accident
will
take
us
at
the
least
four
days
it
will
take
our
pursuers
three
we
must
have
one
clear
day
before
her
highness
evasion
is
discovered
now
the
chief
magistrate
of
innspruck
visits
her
highness
apartments
twice
a
day
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
at
ten
of
the
night
the
princess
must
be
rescued
at
night
and
if
her
escape
is
discovered
in
the
morning
she
will
never
reach
italy
she
will
be
behind
the
bars
again
but
the
princess
mother
will
be
left
said
gaydon
she
can
plead
that
her
daughter
is
the
magistrate
forces
his
way
into
the
very
bedroom
we
must
take
with
us
a
woman
who
will
lie
in
her
highness
bed
with
the
curtains
drawn
about
her
and
a
voice
so
weak
with
suffering
that
she
can
not
raise
it
above
a
whisper
with
eyes
so
tired
from
sleeplessness
she
can
not
bear
a
light
near
them
help
me
in
this
name
me
a
woman
with
the
fortitude
to
stay
behind
gaydon
shook
his
head
she
will
certainly
be
discovered
the
part
she
plays
in
the
escape
must
certainly
be
known
she
will
remain
for
the
captors
to
punish
as
they
will
i
know
no
woman
nay
said
wogan
you
exaggerate
her
danger
once
the
escape
is
brought
to
an
issue
once
her
highness
is
in
bologna
safe
the
emperor
can
not
wreak
vengeance
on
a
woman
it
would
be
too
paltry
and
now
he
made
his
appeal
to
misset
no
my
friend
misset
replied
i
know
no
woman
with
the
fortitude
but
you
do
interrupted
so
do
i
there
no
difficulty
whatever
in
the
matter
misset
has
a
maid
oho
said
gaydon
the
maid
name
is
jenny
aha
said
wogan
she
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
cried
misset
indignantly
my
wife
maid
a
very
good
friend
of
yours
sure
she
is
and
you
did
know
it
said
with
a
chuckle
i
am
the
cunning
man
after
all
she
would
do
a
great
deal
for
me
would
jenny
but
has
she
courage
asked
wogan
faith
her
father
was
a
french
grenadier
and
her
mother
a
it
would
be
a
queer
thing
if
she
was
frightened
by
a
little
matter
of
lying
in
bed
and
pretending
to
be
someone
else
but
can
we
trust
her
with
the
secret
asked
gaydon
no
exclaimed
misset
and
he
rose
angrily
from
his
chair
my
maid
my
wife
maid
did
ever
one
hear
the
like
my
friend
said
quietly
it
seems
almost
as
if
you
wished
to
reflect
upon
jenny
character
which
would
not
be
right
misset
looked
angrily
at
who
was
not
at
all
disturbed
then
he
said
well
at
all
events
she
gossips
we
can
not
take
her
she
would
tell
the
whole
truth
of
our
journey
at
the
first
halt
that
true
said
then
for
the
second
time
that
evening
he
cried
i
have
an
idea
well
we
not
tell
her
the
truth
at
all
i
doubt
if
she
would
come
if
we
told
it
her
jenny
very
likely
has
never
heard
of
her
highness
the
princess
and
i
doubt
if
she
cares
a
button
for
the
king
besides
she
would
never
believe
but
that
we
were
telling
her
a
lie
no
we
make
up
a
probable
likely
sort
of
story
and
then
she
believe
it
to
be
the
truth
i
have
it
cried
wogan
we
tell
her
that
we
are
going
to
abduct
an
heiress
who
is
dying
for
love
of
and
whose
merciless
parents
are
forcing
her
into
a
loveless
despicable
marriage
with
a
tottering
pantaloon
brought
his
hand
down
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
there
the
very
story
he
cried
to
be
sure
you
are
a
great
man
charles
the
most
probable
convincing
story
that
was
ever
invented
oh
but
you
hear
jenny
sob
with
pity
for
the
heiress
and
lucius
when
she
hears
it
it
will
be
a
bad
day
too
for
the
merciless
parents
when
they
discover
jenny
in
her
highness
bed
she
stands
six
feet
in
her
stockings
six
feet
exclaimed
wogan
in
her
stockings
returned
her
height
is
her
one
vanity
therefore
in
her
shoes
she
is
six
feet
four
well
she
must
take
her
heels
off
and
make
herself
as
short
as
she
can
you
will
have
trouble
my
friend
to
persuade
her
to
that
said
hush
said
gaydon
he
rose
and
unlocked
the
door
the
doctor
was
knocking
for
admission
below
gaydon
let
him
in
and
he
dressed
wounds
with
an
assurance
that
they
were
not
deep
and
that
a
few
quiet
would
restore
him
i
will
sleep
the
night
here
if
i
may
said
wogan
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
gone
a
blanket
and
a
chair
will
serve
my
turn
they
took
him
into
gaydon
bedroom
where
three
beds
were
ranged
we
have
slept
in
the
one
room
and
lived
together
since
your
message
came
four
days
ago
said
gaydon
take
your
choice
of
the
beds
for
there
not
one
of
us
has
so
much
need
of
a
bed
as
you
wogan
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
oh
but
it
good
to
be
with
you
he
cried
suddenly
and
caught
at
gaydon
arm
i
shall
sleep
how
i
shall
sleep
he
stretched
out
his
aching
limbs
between
the
cool
white
sheets
and
when
the
lamp
was
extinguished
he
called
to
each
of
his
three
friends
by
name
to
make
sure
of
their
company
answered
with
a
grunt
on
his
right
misset
on
his
left
and
gaydon
from
the
corner
of
the
room
but
i
have
wanted
you
these
last
three
days
said
wogan
when
i
tell
you
the
story
of
them
you
will
know
how
much
i
have
wanted
you
they
got
however
some
inkling
of
wogan
need
before
the
morrow
came
in
the
middle
of
the
night
they
were
wakened
by
a
wild
scream
and
heard
wogan
whispering
in
an
agony
for
help
they
lighted
a
lamp
and
saw
him
lying
with
his
hand
upon
his
throat
and
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
with
horror
quick
said
he
the
hand
at
my
throat
it
not
the
letter
so
much
it
my
life
they
want
it
your
own
hand
said
gaydon
and
taking
the
hand
he
found
it
lifeless
wogan
arm
in
that
position
had
gone
to
sleep
as
the
saying
is
he
had
waked
suddenly
in
the
dark
with
the
cold
pressure
at
his
throat
and
in
the
moment
of
waking
was
back
again
alone
in
the
inn
near
augsburg
wogan
indeed
needed
his
friends
chapter
ix
the
next
morning
wogan
was
tossing
from
side
to
side
in
a
high
fever
the
fever
itself
was
of
no
great
importance
but
it
had
consequences
of
a
influence
for
it
left
wogan
weak
and
tied
to
his
bed
so
that
it
was
gaydon
who
travelled
to
rome
and
obtained
the
passport
gaydon
consequently
saw
what
otherwise
wogan
would
have
seen
and
gaydon
the
cautious
prudent
gaydon
was
careful
to
avoid
making
an
inopportune
discovery
whereas
wogan
would
never
have
rested
until
he
had
made
it
gaydon
stayed
in
rome
a
week
lying
snug
and
close
in
a
lodging
only
one
street
removed
from
that
house
upon
the
tiber
where
his
king
lived
secrets
had
a
way
of
leaking
out
and
gaydon
was
determined
that
this
one
should
not
through
any
inattention
of
his
he
therefore
never
went
abroad
until
dark
and
even
then
kept
aloof
from
the
house
which
overlooked
the
tiber
his
business
he
conducted
through
his
servant
sending
him
to
and
fro
between
edgar
the
secretary
and
himself
one
audience
of
his
king
alone
he
asked
and
that
was
to
be
granted
him
on
the
day
of
his
departure
from
rome
thus
the
time
hung
very
heavily
upon
him
from
daybreak
to
dusk
he
was
cooped
within
a
little
insignificant
room
which
looked
out
upon
a
little
insignificant
street
his
window
however
though
it
promised
little
diversion
was
his
one
resource
gaydon
was
a
man
of
observation
and
found
a
pleasure
in
guessing
at
this
and
that
person
business
from
his
appearance
his
dress
and
whether
he
went
fast
or
slow
so
he
sat
steadily
at
his
window
and
after
a
day
or
two
had
passed
he
began
to
be
puzzled
the
moment
he
was
puzzled
he
became
interested
on
the
second
day
he
drew
his
chair
a
little
distance
back
from
the
window
and
watched
on
the
third
day
he
drew
his
chair
close
to
the
window
but
at
the
side
and
against
the
wall
in
this
way
he
could
see
everything
that
happened
and
everyone
who
passed
and
yet
remain
himself
unobserved
almost
opposite
to
his
window
stood
a
small
mean
house
fallen
into
neglect
and
disrepair
the
windows
were
curtained
with
dust
many
of
the
panes
were
broken
the
shutters
hung
upon
broken
hinges
the
paint
was
peeling
from
the
door
the
house
had
the
most
melancholy
aspect
of
long
disuse
it
seemed
to
belong
to
no
one
and
to
be
crumbling
pitifully
to
ruin
like
an
aged
man
who
has
no
friends
yet
this
house
had
its
uses
which
gaydon
could
not
but
perceive
were
of
a
secret
kind
on
the
very
first
day
that
gaydon
sat
at
his
window
a
man
who
seemed
from
his
dress
to
be
of
a
high
consideration
came
sauntering
along
that
sordid
thoroughfare
where
he
seemed
entirely
out
of
place
like
a
butterfly
on
the
high
seas
to
gaydon
surprise
he
stopped
at
the
door
gave
a
cautious
look
round
and
rapped
quickly
with
his
stick
at
once
the
door
of
that
uninhabited
house
was
opened
the
man
entered
the
door
was
closed
upon
him
and
a
good
hour
by
gaydon
watch
elapsed
before
it
was
opened
again
to
let
him
out
in
the
afternoon
another
man
came
and
was
admitted
with
the
same
secrecy
both
men
had
worn
their
hats
drawn
down
upon
their
foreheads
and
whereas
one
of
them
held
a
muffler
to
his
face
the
other
had
thrust
his
chin
within
the
folds
of
his
cravat
gaydon
had
not
been
able
to
see
the
face
of
either
after
nightfall
he
remarked
that
such
visits
became
more
frequent
moreover
they
were
repeated
on
the
next
day
and
the
next
gaydon
watched
but
never
got
any
nearer
to
a
solution
of
the
mystery
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
day
he
was
more
puzzled
and
interested
than
ever
for
closely
as
he
had
watched
he
had
not
seen
the
face
of
any
man
who
had
passed
in
and
out
of
that
door
but
he
was
to
see
a
face
that
night
at
nine
a
messenger
from
edgar
the
secretary
brought
him
a
package
which
contained
a
letter
and
the
passport
for
these
six
days
delayed
the
letter
warned
him
that
edgar
himself
would
come
to
fetch
him
in
the
morning
to
his
audience
with
james
the
passport
gave
authority
to
a
flemish
nobleman
the
count
of
cernes
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
loretto
with
his
wife
and
family
the
name
of
warner
had
served
its
turn
and
could
no
longer
be
employed
as
soon
as
the
messenger
had
gone
gaydon
destroyed
edgar
letter
put
the
passport
safely
away
in
his
breast
and
since
he
had
not
left
his
room
that
day
put
on
his
hat
being
a
prudent
man
with
a
turn
for
economy
he
also
extinguished
his
lamp
he
had
also
a
liking
for
fresh
air
so
he
opened
the
window
and
at
the
same
moment
the
door
of
the
house
opposite
was
opened
a
tall
burly
man
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
stepped
out
into
the
street
he
was
followed
by
a
slight
man
of
a
short
stature
both
men
were
wrapped
in
their
cloaks
but
the
shorter
one
tripped
on
a
break
in
the
road
and
his
cloak
fell
apart
his
companion
turned
at
once
and
held
his
lantern
aloft
just
for
a
second
the
light
therefore
flashed
upon
a
face
and
gaydon
at
his
dark
window
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
the
face
was
the
face
of
his
king
gaydon
was
more
than
ever
puzzled
he
had
only
seen
the
face
for
an
instant
moreover
he
was
looking
down
upon
it
so
that
he
might
be
mistaken
he
felt
however
that
he
was
not
and
he
began
to
wonder
at
the
business
that
could
take
his
king
to
this
mysterious
house
but
there
was
one
thing
of
which
he
was
sure
amidst
all
his
doubts
rome
was
not
the
safest
city
in
the
world
for
a
man
to
walk
about
at
nights
his
king
would
be
none
the
worse
off
for
a
second
guardian
who
would
follow
near
enough
to
give
help
and
far
enough
for
discretion
gaydon
went
down
his
stairs
into
the
street
the
lantern
twinkled
ahead
gaydon
followed
it
until
it
stopped
before
a
great
house
which
had
lights
burning
here
and
there
in
the
windows
the
smaller
man
mounted
the
steps
and
was
admitted
his
big
companion
with
the
lantern
remained
outside
gaydon
wishing
to
make
sure
of
his
conjectures
one
way
or
the
other
walked
quickly
past
him
and
stole
a
glance
sideways
at
his
face
but
the
man
with
the
lantern
looked
at
gaydon
at
the
same
moment
their
eyes
met
and
the
lantern
was
immediately
held
aloft
it
is
major
gaydon
gaydon
had
to
make
the
best
of
the
business
he
bowed
whittington
i
think
sir
said
whittington
politely
i
am
honoured
by
your
memory
for
myself
i
never
forget
a
face
though
i
see
it
but
for
a
moment
between
the
light
and
the
dark
but
i
do
not
expect
the
like
from
my
acquaintances
we
did
meet
i
believe
in
paris
you
are
of
regiment
and
on
leave
in
rome
said
gaydon
a
trifle
hastily
on
leave
said
whittington
idly
well
so
far
as
towns
go
rome
is
as
good
as
another
though
to
tell
the
truth
i
find
them
all
quite
unendurable
would
i
were
on
leave
but
i
am
pinned
here
a
watchman
with
a
lantern
i
do
but
lack
a
rattle
though
to
be
sure
i
could
not
spring
it
we
are
secret
major
do
you
know
what
house
this
is
no
replied
gaydon
but
i
am
waited
for
and
will
bid
you
he
had
a
thought
that
the
chevalier
since
he
would
be
secret
had
chosen
his
watchman
rather
ill
he
had
no
wish
to
pry
and
so
was
for
returning
to
his
lodging
but
that
careless
imprudent
man
whittington
would
not
lose
a
companion
so
easily
he
caught
gaydon
by
the
arm
well
it
is
the
house
of
maria
vittoria
mademoiselle
de
caprara
the
heiress
of
bologna
who
has
only
this
evening
come
to
rome
and
so
no
later
than
this
evening
i
am
playing
appointed
by
letters
patent
one
might
say
but
what
will
you
youth
is
youth
whether
in
a
ploughboy
or
a
but
my
tongue
needs
a
gag
another
word
and
i
had
said
too
much
well
since
you
will
be
going
we
shall
meet
no
doubt
in
a
certain
house
that
overlooks
the
tiber
hardly
said
gaydon
since
i
leave
rome
indeed
you
leave
rome
said
whittington
i
would
i
were
as
fortunate
and
he
jerked
his
thumb
dolefully
towards
the
caprara
palace
gaydon
hesitated
for
a
moment
considering
whether
or
not
he
should
ask
whittington
to
be
silent
upon
their
meeting
but
he
determined
the
man
was
too
incautious
in
his
speech
if
he
begged
him
not
to
mention
gaydon
presence
in
rome
he
would
remember
it
the
more
surely
and
if
nothing
was
said
he
might
forget
it
gaydon
wished
him
and
went
back
to
his
lodging
walking
rather
moodily
whittington
looked
after
him
and
chuckled
meanwhile
in
a
room
of
the
house
two
people
sat
one
the
slight
graceful
man
who
had
accompanied
whittington
and
whom
gaydon
had
correctly
guessed
to
be
his
king
the
other
maria
vittoria
de
caprara
the
chevalier
de
george
was
speaking
awkwardly
with
a
voice
which
broke
maria
listened
with
a
face
set
and
drawn
she
was
a
girl
both
in
features
and
complexion
of
a
remarkable
purity
of
colour
but
for
her
red
lips
she
had
none
her
hair
was
black
her
face
of
a
clear
pallor
which
her
hair
made
yet
more
pale
her
eyes
matched
her
hair
and
were
so
bright
and
quick
a
starry
spark
seemed
to
glow
in
the
depths
of
them
she
was
a
poet
simile
for
night
the
chevalier
ended
and
sat
with
his
eyes
turned
away
maria
vittoria
did
not
change
her
attitude
nor
for
a
while
did
she
answer
but
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
welled
over
they
ran
down
her
cheeks
she
did
not
wipe
them
away
she
did
not
sob
nor
did
her
face
alter
from
its
fixity
she
did
not
even
close
her
eyes
only
the
tears
rained
down
so
silently
that
the
prince
was
not
aware
of
them
he
had
even
a
thought
as
he
sat
with
his
head
averted
that
she
might
have
shown
a
trifle
more
of
distress
and
it
was
almost
with
a
reproach
upon
his
lips
that
he
turned
to
her
never
was
a
man
more
glad
that
he
had
left
a
word
unspoken
this
silent
grief
of
tears
cut
him
to
the
heart
maria
he
cried
and
moved
towards
her
she
made
no
gesture
to
repel
him
she
did
not
move
but
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
his
holiness
the
pope
had
consented
to
our
marriage
what
would
i
not
have
done
for
you
the
chevalier
stooped
over
her
and
took
her
hand
the
hand
remained
inert
in
his
maria
would
that
i
were
poor
would
that
i
were
powerless
but
i
am
rich
so
rich
i
could
have
done
so
much
i
am
alone
so
much
alone
what
would
i
not
have
done
for
you
maria
his
voice
choked
upon
the
word
his
lips
touched
her
hair
and
she
shivered
from
head
to
foot
then
her
hand
tightened
fast
upon
his
she
drew
him
down
almost
fiercely
until
he
sank
upon
his
knees
by
her
side
she
put
an
arm
about
his
shoulder
and
held
him
to
her
breast
but
you
love
me
she
said
quickly
tell
me
so
say
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
oh
that
we
both
could
die
you
saying
it
i
hearing
it
die
like
this
my
arm
about
you
your
face
against
my
heart
my
lord
my
lord
and
then
she
flung
him
from
her
holding
him
at
arm
length
say
it
with
your
eyes
on
mine
i
can
see
though
the
tears
fall
i
shall
never
hear
the
words
again
after
do
not
stint
me
of
them
let
them
flow
just
as
these
tears
flow
they
will
leave
no
more
trace
than
do
my
tears
maria
i
love
you
said
the
chevalier
how
i
do
love
you
he
took
her
hands
from
his
shoulders
and
pressed
his
forehead
upon
them
she
leaned
forward
and
in
a
voice
so
low
it
seemed
her
heart
was
whispering
not
her
mouth
she
made
her
prayer
say
that
you
have
no
room
in
your
thoughts
except
for
me
say
that
you
have
no
scrap
of
love
he
dropped
her
hands
and
drew
away
she
caught
him
to
her
no
no
say
that
you
have
no
scrap
of
love
to
toss
to
the
woman
there
in
innspruck
maria
he
exclaimed
hush
said
she
with
a
woful
smile
you
shall
love
her
i
will
not
ask
your
eyes
to
dwell
on
mine
or
your
hand
to
quiver
as
it
touches
mine
but
love
no
one
but
me
for
answer
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
she
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
gave
the
kiss
back
gently
as
though
her
lips
feared
to
bruise
his
slowly
as
though
this
one
moment
must
content
her
for
all
her
life
then
she
looked
at
him
for
a
little
and
with
a
childish
movement
that
was
infinitely
sad
she
laid
his
face
side
by
side
with
hers
so
that
his
cheek
touched
hers
shall
i
tell
you
my
thought
she
asked
shall
i
dare
to
tell
you
it
tell
it
me
god
has
died
hush
do
not
move
do
not
speak
perhaps
the
world
will
slip
and
crumble
if
we
but
stay
still
and
they
remained
thus
cheek
to
cheek
silent
in
the
room
staring
forward
with
eyes
wide
open
and
hopeful
the
very
air
seemed
to
them
with
expectation
they
too
had
an
expectant
smile
upon
their
lips
but
there
was
no
crack
of
thunder
overhead
no
roar
of
a
slipping
world
illustration
cheek
to
cheek
silent
in
the
room
staring
forward
with
eyes
wide
open
and
hopeful
the
chevalier
was
the
first
to
move
but
we
are
children
he
cried
starting
up
is
it
not
strange
the
very
pain
which
tortures
us
because
we
are
man
and
woman
should
sink
us
into
children
we
sit
hoping
that
a
miracle
will
split
the
world
in
pieces
this
is
the
caprara
palace
whittington
drowses
outside
over
his
lantern
and
gaydon
rides
with
his
passport
northwards
to
charles
wogan
the
name
hurt
maria
vittoria
like
a
physical
torture
she
beat
her
hands
together
with
a
cry
i
hate
him
i
hate
him
yet
i
have
no
better
servant
speak
no
good
word
of
him
in
my
ears
he
robs
me
of
you
he
risks
his
life
for
me
i
will
pray
that
he
may
lose
it
maria
the
chevalier
started
thrilled
and
almost
appalled
by
the
violence
of
her
passion
i
do
pray
she
cried
every
fibre
in
me
tingles
with
the
prayer
oh
i
hate
him
why
did
you
give
him
leave
to
rescue
her
could
i
refuse
i
did
delay
him
i
did
hesitate
only
gaydon
receives
the
passport
and
even
so
i
have
delayed
too
long
indeed
maria
i
dare
not
think
of
the
shame
the
danger
her
highness
has
endured
for
me
lest
my
presence
here
even
for
this
farewell
should
too
bitterly
reproach
me
at
that
all
maria
vittoria
vehemence
left
her
she
fell
to
beseechings
and
entreaties
with
her
vehemence
went
also
her
dignity
she
dropped
upon
her
knees
and
dragged
herself
across
the
room
to
him
to
james
her
humility
was
more
terrible
than
her
passion
for
passion
had
always
distinguished
her
and
he
was
familiar
with
it
but
pride
had
always
gone
hand
in
hand
with
it
he
stepped
forward
and
would
have
raised
her
from
the
ground
but
maria
would
have
none
of
his
help
she
crouched
at
his
feet
pleading
you
told
me
business
would
call
you
to
spain
go
there
stay
there
for
a
little
oh
not
for
long
but
for
a
month
say
after
your
princess
comes
triumphing
into
bologna
promise
me
that
i
could
not
bear
that
you
should
meet
her
as
she
comes
there
would
be
shouts
i
can
hear
them
no
i
will
not
have
it
i
can
see
her
proud
cursed
face
no
you
think
too
much
of
what
she
has
suffered
if
i
could
have
suffered
too
but
suffering
shame
humiliation
these
fall
to
women
always
have
fallen
we
have
learnt
to
bear
them
so
that
we
feel
them
less
than
you
my
dear
lord
believe
me
her
suffering
is
no
great
thing
if
we
love
we
welcome
it
each
throb
of
pain
endured
for
love
becomes
a
thrill
of
joy
if
i
could
have
suffered
too
it
was
strange
to
hear
this
girl
with
the
streaming
eyes
and
tormented
face
bewail
her
fate
in
that
she
had
not
won
that
great
privilege
of
suffering
she
knelt
on
the
ground
a
splendid
image
of
pain
and
longed
for
pain
that
she
might
prove
thereby
how
little
a
thing
she
made
of
it
the
chevalier
drew
a
stool
to
her
side
and
seating
himself
upon
it
clasped
her
about
the
waist
she
laid
her
cheek
upon
his
knee
just
as
a
dog
will
do
sweetheart
said
he
i
would
have
no
woman
suffer
a
pang
for
me
had
i
my
will
of
the
world
but
since
that
may
not
be
i
do
not
believe
that
any
woman
could
be
deeper
hurt
than
you
are
now
not
clementina
no
maria
uttered
a
little
sigh
her
pain
gave
her
a
sort
of
ownership
of
the
man
who
caused
it
nor
can
she
love
as
deep
she
continued
quietly
a
sobieski
from
the
snows
love
was
born
here
in
italy
she
robs
me
of
you
i
hate
her
then
she
raised
her
face
eagerly
charles
wogan
may
fail
you
do
not
know
him
the
cleverest
have
made
mistakes
and
died
for
them
wogan
makes
mistakes
like
another
but
somehow
gets
the
better
of
them
in
the
end
there
was
a
word
he
said
to
me
when
he
begged
for
my
permission
i
told
him
his
plan
was
a
mere
dream
he
answered
he
would
dream
it
true
he
will
you
should
have
waked
him
you
were
the
master
he
the
servant
you
were
the
king
and
when
can
the
king
do
what
he
wills
instead
of
what
he
must
maria
if
you
and
i
had
met
before
i
sent
charles
wogan
to
search
out
a
wife
for
me
maria
vittoria
knelt
up
she
drew
herself
away
he
chose
her
as
your
wife
if
only
i
had
had
time
to
summon
him
back
he
chose
her
charles
wogan
how
i
hate
him
i
sent
him
to
make
the
choice
and
he
might
have
gone
no
step
beyond
bologna
there
was
i
not
a
mile
distant
ready
to
his
hand
but
i
was
too
mean
too
despicable
maria
hush
and
the
troubled
voice
in
which
he
spoke
rang
with
so
much
pain
that
she
was
at
once
contrite
with
remorse
my
lord
i
hurt
you
so
you
see
how
i
am
proven
mean
give
me
your
hand
and
laugh
to
me
laugh
with
your
heart
and
eyes
and
lips
i
am
jealous
of
your
pain
i
am
a
woman
i
would
have
it
all
gather
it
all
into
my
bosom
and
cherish
each
sharp
stab
like
a
flower
my
lover
gives
to
me
i
am
glad
of
them
they
are
flowers
that
will
not
wither
add
a
kiss
sweetheart
the
sharpest
stab
and
so
the
chief
flower
the
very
rose
of
flowers
there
that
is
well
and
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
turned
away
so
she
stood
for
a
little
and
when
she
turned
again
she
wore
upon
her
face
the
smile
which
she
had
bidden
rise
in
his
would
we
were
free
cried
the
chevalier
but
since
we
are
not
let
us
show
brave
faces
to
the
world
and
hide
our
hearts
i
do
wish
you
all
happiness
but
you
will
go
to
spain
a
friend
hand
in
warrant
of
the
wish
she
held
out
a
hand
which
clasped
his
firmly
without
so
much
as
a
tremor
my
friend
said
she
speak
those
same
words
to
me
and
no
word
more
i
am
tired
with
the
day
doings
i
have
need
of
sleep
oh
great
need
of
it
the
chevalier
read
plainly
the
overwhelming
strain
her
counterfeit
of
friendliness
put
upon
her
he
dared
not
prolong
it
even
as
he
looked
at
her
her
lips
quivered
and
her
eyes
swam
my
friend
said
he
she
conducted
him
along
a
wide
gallery
to
the
great
staircase
where
her
lackeys
waited
then
he
bowed
to
her
and
she
curtsied
low
to
him
but
no
word
was
spoken
by
either
this
little
comedy
must
needs
be
played
in
pantomime
lest
the
actors
should
spoil
it
with
a
show
of
broken
hearts
maria
vittoria
went
back
to
the
room
she
could
have
hindered
wogan
if
she
had
had
the
mind
she
had
the
time
to
betray
him
she
knew
of
his
purpose
but
the
thought
of
betrayal
never
so
much
as
entered
her
thoughts
she
hated
him
she
hated
clementina
but
she
was
loyal
to
her
king
she
sat
alone
in
her
palace
her
chin
propped
upon
her
hands
and
in
a
little
in
her
wide
unblinking
eyes
the
tears
gathered
again
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
on
her
hands
she
wept
silently
and
without
a
movement
like
a
statue
weeping
the
chevalier
found
whittington
waiting
for
him
but
the
candle
in
his
lantern
had
burned
out
i
have
kept
you
here
a
wearisome
long
time
he
said
with
an
effort
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
speak
upon
an
indifferent
matter
i
had
some
talk
with
major
gaydon
which
helped
me
to
beguile
it
said
whittington
gaydon
exclaimed
the
chevalier
are
you
certain
a
man
may
make
mistakes
in
the
darkness
said
whittington
to
be
sure
and
i
never
had
an
eye
for
faces
it
was
not
gaydon
then
said
the
chevalier
it
may
not
have
been
said
whittington
and
by
the
best
of
good
fortune
i
said
nothing
to
him
of
any
significance
whatever
the
chevalier
was
satisfied
with
the
reply
he
had
chosen
the
right
attendant
for
this
nocturnal
visit
had
gaydon
met
with
a
more
observant
man
than
whittington
outside
the
caprara
palace
he
might
have
got
a
number
of
foolish
suspicions
into
his
head
gaydon
however
was
at
that
moment
in
his
bed
saying
to
himself
that
there
were
many
matters
concerning
which
it
would
be
an
impertinence
for
him
to
have
one
meddlesome
thought
by
god
blessing
he
was
a
soldier
and
no
politician
he
fell
asleep
comforted
by
that
conclusion
in
the
morning
edgar
the
chevalier
secretary
came
privately
to
him
the
king
will
receive
you
now
said
he
let
us
go
it
is
broad
daylight
we
shall
be
seen
not
if
the
street
is
empty
said
edgar
looking
out
of
the
window
the
street
as
it
chanced
was
for
the
moment
empty
edgar
crossed
the
street
and
rapped
quickly
with
certain
pauses
between
the
raps
on
the
door
of
that
deserted
house
into
which
gaydon
had
watched
men
enter
the
door
was
opened
follow
me
said
edgar
gaydon
followed
him
into
a
bare
passage
unswept
and
with
discoloured
walls
a
man
in
a
little
hutch
in
the
wall
opened
and
closed
the
door
with
a
string
edgar
walked
forward
to
the
end
of
the
passage
with
gaydon
at
his
heels
the
two
men
came
to
a
flight
of
stone
steps
which
they
descended
the
steps
led
to
a
dark
and
dripping
cellar
with
no
pavement
but
the
mud
and
that
depressed
into
puddles
the
air
was
cold
and
noisome
the
walls
to
the
touch
of
gaydon
hand
were
greasy
with
slime
he
followed
edgar
across
the
cellar
into
a
sort
of
tunnel
here
edgar
drew
an
end
of
candle
from
his
pocket
and
lighted
it
the
tunnel
was
so
low
that
gaydon
though
a
shortish
man
could
barely
hold
his
head
erect
he
followed
edgar
to
the
end
and
up
a
flight
of
winding
steps
the
air
grew
warmer
and
dryer
they
had
risen
above
ground
the
spiral
wound
within
the
thickness
of
a
wall
the
steps
ended
abruptly
there
was
no
door
visible
in
face
of
them
and
on
each
side
the
bare
stone
walls
enclosed
them
edgar
stooped
down
and
pressed
with
his
finger
on
a
round
insignificant
discolouration
of
the
stone
then
he
stood
up
again
you
will
breathe
no
word
of
this
passage
major
gaydon
said
he
the
house
was
built
a
century
ago
when
rome
was
more
troubled
than
it
is
but
the
passage
was
never
more
useful
than
now
men
from
england
whose
names
it
would
astonish
you
to
know
have
trodden
these
steps
on
a
secret
visit
to
the
king
ah
from
the
wall
before
their
faces
a
great
slab
of
the
size
of
a
door
sank
noiselessly
down
and
disclosed
a
wooden
panel
the
panel
slid
aside
edgar
and
gaydon
stepped
into
a
little
cabinet
lighted
by
a
single
window
the
room
was
empty
gaydon
took
a
peep
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
tiber
eddying
beneath
edgar
went
to
a
corner
and
touched
a
spring
the
stone
slab
rose
from
its
grooves
the
panel
slid
back
across
it
at
the
same
moment
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
the
chevalier
stepped
across
the
threshold
gaydon
could
no
longer
even
pretend
to
doubt
who
had
walked
with
whittington
to
the
caprara
palace
the
night
before
it
was
none
of
his
business
however
he
assured
himself
if
his
king
dwelt
with
emphasis
upon
the
dangers
of
the
enterprise
it
was
not
his
business
to
remark
upon
it
or
to
be
thereby
disheartened
the
king
said
very
graciously
that
he
would
hold
the
major
and
his
friends
in
no
less
esteem
if
by
any
misfortune
they
came
back
that
was
most
kind
of
him
but
it
was
none
of
gaydon
business
the
king
was
ill
at
ease
and
looked
as
though
he
had
not
slept
a
wink
the
livelong
night
well
swollen
eyes
and
a
patched
pallid
face
disfigure
all
men
at
times
and
in
any
case
they
were
none
of
gaydon
business
he
rode
out
of
rome
that
afternoon
as
the
light
was
failing
he
rode
at
a
quick
trot
and
did
not
notice
at
the
corner
of
a
street
a
big
stalwart
man
who
sauntered
along
swinging
his
stick
by
the
tassel
with
a
vacant
look
of
idleness
upon
the
he
stopped
and
directed
the
same
vacant
look
at
gaydon
but
he
was
thinking
curiously
will
he
tell
charles
wogan
the
stalwart
man
was
harry
whittington
gaydon
however
never
breathed
a
word
about
the
caprara
palace
when
he
handed
the
passport
to
charles
wogan
at
schlestadt
wogan
was
sitting
propped
up
with
pillows
in
a
chair
and
he
asked
gaydon
many
questions
of
the
news
at
rome
and
how
the
king
bore
himself
the
king
was
not
in
the
best
of
spirits
said
gaydon
with
this
cried
wogan
flourishing
the
passport
we
find
a
means
to
hearten
him
gaydon
filled
a
pipe
and
lighted
it
will
you
tell
me
wogan
he
asked
i
am
by
nature
curious
was
it
the
king
who
proposed
this
enterprise
to
you
or
was
it
you
who
proposed
it
to
the
king
the
question
had
an
extraordinary
effect
wogan
was
startled
out
of
his
chair
what
do
you
mean
he
exclaimed
fiercely
there
was
something
more
than
fierceness
in
the
words
an
accent
of
fear
it
almost
seemed
to
gaydon
there
was
a
look
almost
of
fear
in
his
eyes
as
though
he
had
let
some
appalling
secret
slip
gaydon
stared
at
him
in
wonder
and
wogan
recovered
himself
with
a
laugh
faith
said
he
it
is
a
question
to
perplex
a
man
i
misdoubt
but
we
both
had
the
thought
about
the
same
time
said
he
the
princess
with
a
chain
on
her
leg
so
to
speak
and
i
answered
him
chain
a
galling
sort
of
thing
to
a
lady
ankle
there
was
little
more
said
if
i
remember
right
gaydon
nodded
as
though
his
curiosity
was
now
satisfied
wogan
alarm
was
strange
no
doubt
strange
and
unexpected
like
the
chevalier
visit
to
the
caprara
palace
gaydon
had
a
glimpse
of
dark
and
troubled
waters
but
he
turned
his
face
away
they
were
none
of
his
business
chapter
x
in
an
hour
however
he
returned
out
of
breath
and
with
a
face
white
from
despair
wogan
was
still
writing
at
his
table
but
at
his
first
glance
towards
gaydon
he
started
quickly
to
his
feet
and
altogether
forgot
to
cover
over
his
sheet
of
paper
he
carefully
shut
the
door
you
have
bad
news
said
he
there
was
never
worse
answered
gaydon
he
had
run
so
fast
he
was
so
discomposed
that
he
could
with
difficulty
speak
but
he
gasped
his
bad
news
out
in
the
end
i
went
to
my
brother
major
to
report
my
return
he
was
entertaining
his
friends
he
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
strasbourg
and
he
read
it
aloud
the
letter
said
a
rumour
was
running
through
the
town
that
the
chevalier
wogan
had
already
rescued
the
princess
and
was
being
hotly
pursued
on
the
road
to
trent
if
wogan
felt
any
disquietude
he
was
careful
to
hide
it
he
sat
comfortably
down
upon
the
sofa
i
expected
rumour
would
be
busy
with
us
said
he
but
never
that
it
would
take
so
favourable
a
shape
favourable
exclaimed
gaydon
to
be
sure
for
its
falsity
will
be
established
and
ridicule
cast
upon
those
who
spread
and
believed
it
false
alarms
are
the
proper
strategy
to
conceal
the
real
assault
the
rumour
does
us
a
service
our
secret
is
very
well
kept
for
here
am
i
in
schlestadt
and
people
living
in
schlestadt
believe
me
on
the
road
to
trent
i
will
go
back
with
you
to
the
major
and
have
a
laugh
at
his
correspondent
courage
my
friend
we
will
give
our
enemies
a
month
let
them
cry
wolf
as
often
as
they
will
during
that
month
we
get
into
the
fold
all
the
more
easily
in
the
end
wogan
took
his
hat
to
accompany
gaydon
but
at
that
moment
he
heard
another
man
stumbling
in
a
great
haste
up
the
stairs
misset
broke
into
the
room
with
a
face
as
discomposed
as
gaydon
had
been
here
another
who
has
heard
the
same
rumour
said
wogan
it
is
more
than
a
rumour
said
misset
it
is
an
order
and
most
peremptory
from
the
court
of
france
forbidding
any
officer
of
regiment
to
be
absent
for
more
than
hours
from
his
duties
on
pain
of
being
broke
our
secret
out
that
the
plain
truth
of
the
matter
he
stood
by
the
table
drumming
with
his
fingers
in
a
great
agitation
then
his
fingers
stopped
he
had
been
drumming
upon
wogan
sheet
of
paper
and
the
writing
on
the
sheet
had
suddenly
attracted
his
notice
it
was
writing
in
unusually
regular
lines
gaydon
arrested
by
change
from
restlessness
to
fixity
looked
that
way
for
a
second
too
but
he
turned
his
head
aside
very
quickly
wogan
handwriting
was
none
of
his
business
we
will
give
them
a
month
said
wogan
who
was
conjecturing
at
the
motive
of
this
order
from
the
court
of
france
no
doubt
we
are
suspected
i
never
had
a
hope
that
we
should
not
be
the
court
of
france
you
see
can
do
no
less
than
forbid
us
but
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
it
winks
at
us
on
the
sly
we
will
give
them
a
month
colonel
lally
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
friend
of
the
king
we
will
get
an
abatement
of
that
order
so
that
not
one
of
you
shall
be
cashiered
i
do
flinch
at
that
said
misset
but
the
secret
out
then
we
must
use
the
more
precautions
said
wogan
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
somehow
he
would
bring
the
princess
safely
out
of
her
prison
to
bologna
it
could
not
be
that
she
was
born
to
be
wasted
misset
however
was
not
so
confident
upon
the
matter
a
strange
imperturbable
man
is
charles
wogan
said
he
to
gaydon
and
the
same
evening
did
you
happen
by
any
chance
to
cast
your
eye
over
the
paper
i
had
my
hand
on
i
did
not
said
gaydon
in
a
great
hurry
it
was
a
private
letter
no
doubt
it
was
poetry
there
no
need
for
you
to
hurry
my
friend
it
was
more
than
mere
poetry
it
was
in
latin
i
read
the
first
line
on
the
page
and
it
ran
dum
spernit
arat
novus
accola
max
ubi
gaydon
tore
his
arm
away
from
misset
i
hear
no
more
of
it
he
cried
poetry
is
none
of
my
business
there
dick
you
are
wrong
said
sententiously
both
misset
and
gaydon
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
stared
never
had
poetry
so
strange
an
advocate
set
his
great
legs
apart
and
his
arms
akimbo
he
rocked
himself
backwards
and
forwards
on
his
heels
and
toes
while
a
benevolent
smile
of
superiority
wrinkled
across
his
broad
face
from
ear
to
ear
yes
i
done
it
said
he
i
written
poetry
it
is
a
thing
a
polite
gentleman
should
be
able
to
do
so
i
did
it
it
was
in
latin
because
the
young
lady
it
was
written
to
did
understand
latin
her
name
was
lucy
and
i
rhymed
her
to
and
the
pleasure
of
it
made
her
purple
in
the
face
there
were
to
have
been
four
lines
but
there
were
never
more
than
three
and
a
half
because
i
could
not
think
of
a
suitable
rhyme
to
lucy
said
she
knew
one
but
she
would
never
tell
it
me
wogan
poetry
however
was
of
quite
a
different
kind
and
had
gaydon
looked
at
it
a
trifle
more
closely
he
would
have
experienced
some
relief
it
was
all
about
the
sorrows
and
miseries
of
his
unfortunate
race
and
the
cruel
oppression
of
england
england
owed
all
its
great
men
to
ireland
and
was
currish
enough
never
to
acknowledge
the
debt
wogan
always
grew
melancholy
and
on
that
subject
when
he
had
the
leisure
to
be
idle
he
thought
bitterly
of
the
many
irish
officers
sent
into
exile
and
killed
in
the
service
of
alien
countries
his
sense
of
injustice
grew
into
a
passionate
sort
of
despair
and
the
despair
tumbled
out
of
him
in
sonorous
latin
verse
written
in
the
virgilian
measure
he
wrote
a
deal
of
it
during
this
month
of
waiting
and
a
long
while
afterwards
sent
an
extract
to
dr
swift
and
received
the
great
man
compliments
upon
its
felicity
as
anyone
may
see
for
himself
in
the
doctor
correspondence
how
the
month
passed
for
james
stuart
in
rome
may
be
partly
guessed
from
a
letter
which
was
brought
to
wogan
by
michael
vezozzi
the
the
letter
announced
that
king
george
of
england
had
offered
the
princess
clementina
a
dowry
of
if
she
would
marry
the
prince
of
baden
and
that
the
prince
of
baden
with
a
numerous
following
was
already
at
innspruck
to
prosecute
his
suit
i
do
not
know
but
what
her
highness
he
wrote
will
receive
the
best
consolation
for
her
sufferings
on
my
account
if
she
accepts
so
favourable
a
proposal
rather
than
run
so
many
hazards
as
she
must
needs
do
as
my
wife
for
myself
i
have
been
summoned
most
urgently
into
spain
and
am
travelling
thither
on
the
instant
wogan
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
letter
why
should
the
king
go
to
spain
at
the
time
when
the
princess
clementina
might
be
expected
at
bologna
it
was
plain
that
he
did
not
expect
wogan
would
succeed
he
was
disheartened
wogan
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
the
whole
meaning
of
the
letter
he
was
however
for
other
reasons
glad
to
receive
it
it
is
very
well
i
have
this
letter
said
he
for
until
it
came
i
had
no
scrap
of
writing
whatever
to
show
either
to
her
highness
or
what
i
take
to
be
more
important
to
her
highness
mother
and
he
went
back
to
his
poetry
misset
and
his
wife
on
the
other
hand
drove
forward
to
the
town
of
colmar
where
they
bought
a
travelling
carriage
and
the
necessaries
for
the
journey
misset
left
his
wife
at
colmar
but
returned
every
hours
himself
they
made
the
excuse
that
misset
had
won
a
deal
of
money
at
play
and
was
minded
to
lay
it
out
in
presents
to
his
wife
the
stratagem
had
a
wonderful
success
at
schlestadt
especially
amongst
the
ladies
who
could
do
nothing
day
and
night
but
praise
in
their
husbands
hearing
so
excellent
a
mode
of
disposing
of
winnings
spent
his
month
in
polishing
his
pistols
and
sharpening
his
sword
it
is
true
that
he
had
to
persuade
jenny
to
bear
them
company
but
that
was
the
work
of
an
afternoon
he
told
her
the
story
of
the
rich
austrian
heiress
promised
her
a
hundred
guineas
and
a
damask
gown
gave
her
a
kiss
and
the
matter
was
settled
jenny
passed
her
month
in
a
delicious
excitement
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
camp
and
had
no
fears
whatever
she
was
a
conspirator
she
was
trusted
with
a
tremendous
secret
she
was
to
help
the
beautiful
and
enormous
to
a
rich
and
beautiful
wife
she
was
to
outwit
an
old
curmudgeon
of
an
uncle
she
was
to
succour
a
maiden
and
imprisoned
jenny
was
quite
uplifted
never
had
a
been
born
to
so
high
a
destiny
her
only
difficulty
was
to
keep
silence
and
when
the
silence
became
no
longer
endurable
she
would
run
on
some
excuse
or
another
to
wogan
and
divert
him
with
the
properest
sentiments
to
me
she
would
cry
there
nothing
sinful
in
changing
clothes
with
the
beautiful
mistress
of
christian
charity
says
we
are
to
make
others
happy
i
am
a
christian
and
as
to
the
uncle
he
can
go
to
the
devil
he
can
do
nothing
to
me
but
talk
and
i
do
understand
his
stupid
language
jenny
was
the
one
person
really
happy
during
this
month
it
was
effort
to
keep
her
so
for
she
was
the
very
pivot
of
his
plan
there
remains
yet
one
other
who
had
most
reason
of
all
to
repine
at
the
delay
the
princess
clementina
her
mother
wearied
her
with
perpetual
complaints
the
prince
of
baden
who
was
allowed
admittance
to
the
villa
persecuted
her
with
his
attentions
she
knew
nothing
of
what
was
planned
for
her
escape
and
the
rigorous
confinement
was
not
relaxed
it
was
not
a
happy
time
for
clementina
yet
she
was
not
entirely
unhappy
a
thought
had
come
to
her
and
stayed
with
her
which
called
the
colour
to
her
cheeks
and
a
smile
to
her
lips
it
accounted
to
her
for
the
delay
her
pride
was
restored
by
it
because
of
it
she
became
yet
more
patient
with
her
mother
more
gentle
with
the
prince
of
baden
more
to
her
gaolers
it
sang
at
her
heart
like
a
bird
it
lightened
in
her
grey
eyes
it
had
come
to
her
one
sleepless
night
and
the
morning
had
not
revealed
it
as
a
mere
phantasy
born
of
the
night
the
more
she
pondered
it
the
more
certain
was
she
of
its
truth
her
king
was
coming
himself
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
to
rescue
her
chapter
xi
therefore
she
waited
in
patience
it
was
still
winter
at
innspruck
though
the
calendar
declared
it
to
be
spring
april
was
budless
and
cold
a
month
of
storms
the
snow
drifted
deep
along
the
streets
and
chateaudoux
was
much
inconvenienced
during
his
promenades
in
the
afternoon
he
would
come
back
with
most
reproachful
eyes
for
clementina
in
that
she
so
stubbornly
clung
to
her
vagabond
exile
and
refused
so
fine
a
match
as
the
prince
of
baden
on
the
afternoon
of
the
however
clementina
read
more
than
reproach
in
his
eyes
more
than
discomfort
in
the
agitation
of
his
manner
the
little
chamberlain
was
afraid
clementina
guessed
the
reason
of
his
fear
he
has
come
she
cried
the
exultation
of
her
voice
the
deep
breath
she
drew
the
rush
of
blood
to
her
face
and
the
sudden
dancing
light
in
her
eyes
showed
how
much
constraint
she
had
set
upon
herself
she
was
like
an
ember
blown
to
a
flame
you
were
stopped
in
your
walk
you
have
a
message
for
me
he
has
come
the
height
of
her
joy
was
the
depth
of
chateaudoux
regret
i
was
stopped
in
my
walk
said
he
but
not
by
the
chevalier
wogan
who
it
was
i
do
not
know
can
you
not
guess
cried
clementina
i
would
not
trust
a
stranger
said
her
mother
would
you
not
asked
clementina
with
a
smile
describe
him
to
me
his
face
was
wrinkled
said
chateaudoux
it
was
disguised
his
figure
was
slight
and
not
chateaudoux
gave
a
fairly
accurate
description
of
gaydon
i
know
no
one
whom
the
portrait
fits
said
the
mother
and
again
clementina
cried
can
you
not
guess
then
mother
i
will
punish
you
for
though
i
know
in
very
truth
i
know
i
will
not
tell
you
she
turned
back
to
chateaudoux
well
his
message
he
did
fix
a
time
a
day
an
hour
for
my
escape
the
is
the
day
and
at
eight
of
the
night
i
will
be
ready
he
will
come
here
to
fetch
your
highness
meanwhile
he
prays
your
highness
to
fall
sick
and
keep
your
bed
i
can
choose
my
malady
said
clementina
it
will
not
all
be
counterfeit
for
indeed
i
shall
fall
sick
of
joy
but
why
must
i
fall
sick
he
brings
a
woman
to
take
your
place
who
lying
in
bed
with
the
curtains
drawn
will
the
later
be
discovered
the
princess
mother
saw
here
a
hindrance
to
success
and
eagerly
she
spoke
of
it
how
will
the
woman
enter
how
too
will
my
daughter
leave
chateaudoux
coughed
and
hemmed
in
a
great
confusion
he
explained
in
delicate
hints
that
he
himself
was
to
bribe
the
sentry
at
the
door
to
let
her
pass
for
a
few
moments
into
the
house
the
princess
broke
into
a
laugh
her
name
is
friederika
i
warrant
she
cried
my
poor
chateaudoux
they
give
you
a
sweetheart
it
is
most
cruel
well
friederika
thanks
to
the
sentry
for
a
burning
heart
friederika
slips
in
at
the
door
which
i
have
taken
care
should
stand
unlatched
she
changes
clothes
with
your
highness
and
your
highness
slips
out
in
her
stead
but
he
is
to
come
for
you
he
says
exclaimed
her
mother
and
how
will
he
do
that
besides
we
do
not
know
his
name
and
there
must
be
a
fitting
companion
who
will
travel
with
you
has
he
that
companion
your
highness
said
chateaudoux
upon
all
those
points
he
bade
me
say
you
should
be
satisfied
all
he
asks
is
that
you
will
be
ready
at
the
time
a
gust
of
hail
struck
the
window
and
made
the
room
tremble
clementina
laughed
her
mother
shivered
the
prince
of
baden
said
she
with
a
sigh
clementina
shrugged
her
shoulders
a
prince
said
chateaudoux
persuasively
with
much
territory
to
his
princeliness
a
vain
fat
pudgy
man
said
clementina
a
sober
honest
gentleman
said
the
mother
a
sober
butler
to
an
honest
gentleman
said
clementina
he
has
an
air
said
chateaudoux
he
has
indeed
replied
clementina
as
though
he
handed
himself
upon
a
plate
to
you
and
said
is
a
miracle
thank
god
for
it
well
i
must
take
to
my
bed
i
am
very
ill
i
have
a
fever
on
me
and
truth
she
moved
towards
the
door
but
before
she
had
reached
it
there
came
a
knocking
on
the
street
door
below
clementina
stopped
chateaudoux
looked
out
of
the
window
it
is
the
prince
carriage
said
he
i
will
not
see
him
exclaimed
clementina
my
child
you
must
said
her
mother
if
only
for
the
last
time
each
time
he
comes
it
is
for
the
last
time
yet
the
next
day
sees
him
still
in
innspruck
my
patience
and
my
courtesy
are
both
outworn
besides
now
that
i
have
heard
this
great
news
we
have
waited
for
how
long
oh
mother
oh
mother
i
can
not
i
shall
betray
myself
the
princess
mother
made
an
effort
clementina
you
must
receive
him
i
will
have
it
so
i
am
your
mother
i
will
be
your
mother
she
said
in
a
tremulous
tone
as
though
the
mere
utterance
of
the
command
frightened
her
by
its
audacity
clementina
was
softened
on
the
instant
she
ran
across
to
her
chair
and
kneeling
by
it
said
with
a
laugh
so
you
shall
i
would
not
barter
mothers
with
any
girl
in
christendom
but
you
understand
i
am
pledged
in
honour
to
my
king
i
will
receive
the
prince
but
indeed
i
would
he
had
not
come
and
rising
again
she
kissed
her
mother
on
the
forehead
she
received
the
prince
of
baden
alone
he
was
a
stout
man
of
much
ceremony
and
took
some
while
to
elaborate
a
compliment
upon
altered
looks
before
he
had
always
seen
her
armed
and
helmeted
with
dignity
now
she
had
much
ado
to
keep
her
lips
from
twitching
into
a
smile
and
the
smile
in
her
eyes
she
could
not
hide
at
all
the
prince
took
the
change
to
himself
his
persistent
wooing
had
not
been
after
all
in
vain
he
was
not
however
the
man
to
make
the
least
of
his
sufferings
in
the
pursuit
which
seemed
to
end
so
suitably
madam
he
said
with
his
grandest
air
i
think
to
have
given
you
some
proof
of
my
devotion
even
on
this
inclement
day
i
come
to
pay
my
duty
though
the
streets
are
deep
in
snow
oh
sir
exclaimed
clementina
then
your
feet
are
wet
never
run
such
risks
for
me
i
would
have
no
man
weep
on
my
account
though
it
were
only
from
a
cold
in
the
head
the
prince
glanced
at
clementina
suspiciously
was
this
devotion
he
preferred
to
think
so
madam
have
no
fears
said
he
tenderly
wishing
to
set
the
anxious
creature
at
her
ease
i
drove
here
in
my
carriage
but
from
the
carriage
to
the
door
you
walked
no
madam
i
was
carried
clementina
lips
twitched
again
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
seen
you
carried
she
said
demurely
i
suppose
you
would
not
repeat
the
no
it
would
be
to
ask
too
much
besides
from
my
windows
here
in
the
side
of
the
house
i
could
not
see
and
she
sighed
deeply
the
fatuous
gentleman
took
comfort
from
the
sigh
madam
you
have
but
to
say
the
word
and
your
windows
shall
look
whichever
way
you
will
clementina
however
did
not
say
the
word
she
merely
sighed
again
the
prince
thought
it
a
convenient
moment
to
assert
his
position
i
have
stayed
a
long
while
in
innspruck
setting
my
constancy
which
bade
me
stay
above
my
dignity
which
bade
me
go
for
three
months
i
have
stayed
a
long
while
madam
i
do
not
think
three
years
could
have
been
longer
said
clementina
with
the
utmost
sympathy
so
now
in
the
end
i
have
called
my
pride
to
help
me
the
noblest
gift
that
heaven
has
given
a
man
said
clementina
fervently
the
prince
bowed
low
clementina
curtsied
majestically
illustration
the
prince
strutted
to
the
window
clementina
solemnly
kept
pace
with
him
will
you
give
me
your
hand
said
he
as
far
as
your
window
certainly
sir
and
out
of
it
clementina
laid
her
hand
in
his
the
prince
strutted
to
the
window
clementina
solemnly
kept
pace
with
him
what
do
you
see
a
sentinel
fixed
there
guarding
you
at
the
door
stands
a
second
sentinel
answer
me
as
i
would
be
answered
your
window
and
your
door
are
free
refuse
me
and
i
travel
into
italy
my
trunks
are
already
packed
neatly
packed
i
hope
said
clementina
her
cheek
was
flushed
her
lips
no
longer
smiled
but
she
spoke
most
politely
and
the
prince
was
at
a
loss
will
you
give
me
your
hand
said
she
as
far
as
my
table
the
prince
doubtfully
stretched
out
his
hand
and
the
couple
paced
in
a
stately
fashion
to
clementina
table
what
do
you
see
upon
my
table
said
she
with
something
of
the
prince
pomposity
a
picture
said
he
reluctantly
whose
the
pretender
he
answered
with
a
sneer
the
king
said
she
pleasantly
his
picture
is
fixed
there
guarding
me
against
my
heart
there
lies
a
second
i
wish
your
highness
all
speed
to
italy
she
dropped
his
hand
bowed
to
him
again
in
sign
that
the
interview
was
ended
the
prince
had
a
final
argument
you
refuse
a
dowry
of
i
would
have
you
think
of
that
sir
you
think
of
it
for
both
of
us
the
prince
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
stature
i
have
your
answer
then
you
have
sir
you
had
it
yesterday
and
if
i
remember
right
the
day
before
i
will
stay
yet
two
more
days
madam
you
need
not
fear
i
shall
not
importune
you
i
give
you
those
two
days
for
reflection
unless
i
hear
from
you
i
shall
leave
innspruck
in
two
days
time
suddenly
exclaimed
clementina
on
the
evening
of
the
said
the
prince
clementina
laughed
softly
in
a
way
which
he
did
not
understand
she
was
altogether
in
a
strange
incomprehensible
mood
that
afternoon
and
when
he
learnt
next
day
that
she
had
taken
to
her
bed
he
was
not
surprised
perhaps
he
was
not
altogether
grieved
it
seemed
right
that
she
should
be
punished
for
her
stubbornness
punishment
might
soften
her
but
no
message
came
to
him
during
those
two
days
and
on
the
morning
of
the
he
set
out
for
italy
at
the
second
posting
stage
which
he
reached
about
three
of
the
afternoon
he
crossed
a
hired
carriage
on
its
way
to
innspruck
the
carriage
left
the
inn
door
as
the
prince
drove
up
to
it
he
noticed
the
great
size
of
the
coachman
on
the
box
he
saw
also
that
a
man
and
two
women
were
seated
within
the
carriage
and
that
a
servant
rode
on
horseback
by
the
door
the
road
however
was
a
busy
one
day
and
night
travellers
passed
up
and
down
the
prince
gave
only
a
passing
scrutiny
to
that
carriage
rolling
down
the
hill
to
innspruck
besides
he
was
acquainted
neither
with
gaydon
who
rode
within
the
carriage
nor
with
wogan
the
servant
at
the
door
nor
with
the
fat
man
on
the
box
at
nightfall
the
prince
came
to
nazareth
a
lonely
village
amongst
the
mountains
with
a
single
tavern
where
he
thought
to
sleep
the
night
there
was
but
one
however
which
was
already
bespoken
by
a
flemish
lady
the
countess
of
cernes
who
had
travelled
that
morning
to
innspruck
to
fetch
her
niece
the
prince
grumbled
for
a
little
since
the
evening
was
growing
stormy
and
wild
but
there
was
no
remedy
he
could
not
dispute
the
matter
for
he
was
shown
the
countess
berlin
waiting
ready
for
her
return
a
servant
of
the
count
household
also
had
been
left
behind
at
nazareth
to
retain
the
room
and
this
man
while
using
all
proper
civilities
refused
to
give
up
possession
the
prince
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
officers
of
dillon
irish
regiment
so
that
he
had
no
single
suspicion
that
captain
misset
was
the
servant
he
drove
on
for
another
stage
where
he
found
a
lodging
meanwhile
the
hired
carriage
rolled
into
innspruck
and
a
storm
of
extraordinary
violence
burst
over
the
country
chapter
xii
in
fact
just
about
the
time
when
the
prince
horses
were
being
unharnessed
from
his
carriage
on
the
heights
of
mount
brenner
the
hired
carriage
stopped
before
a
little
inn
under
the
town
wall
of
innspruck
hard
by
the
bridge
and
half
an
hour
later
when
the
prince
was
sitting
down
to
his
supper
before
a
blazing
fire
and
thanking
his
stars
that
on
so
gusty
and
wild
a
night
he
had
a
stout
roof
above
his
head
a
man
and
a
woman
came
out
from
the
little
tavern
under
the
town
wall
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
they
had
the
streets
to
themselves
for
that
night
the
city
was
a
whirlpool
of
the
winds
each
separate
chasm
in
the
encircling
hills
was
a
mouth
to
discharge
a
separate
blast
the
winds
swept
down
into
the
hollow
and
charged
in
a
riotous
combat
about
the
squares
and
lanes
at
each
corner
was
an
ambuscade
and
everywhere
they
clashed
with
artilleries
of
hail
and
sleet
the
man
and
woman
staggered
hand
in
hand
and
floundered
in
the
deep
snow
they
were
soaked
to
the
skin
frozen
by
the
cold
and
whipped
by
the
stinging
hail
though
they
bent
their
heads
and
bodies
though
they
clung
hand
in
hand
though
they
struggled
with
all
their
strength
there
were
times
when
they
could
not
advance
a
foot
and
must
needs
wait
for
a
lull
in
the
shelter
of
a
porch
at
such
times
the
man
would
perhaps
quote
a
line
of
virgil
about
the
cave
of
the
winds
and
the
woman
curse
like
a
grenadier
they
however
were
not
the
only
people
who
were
distressed
by
the
storm
outside
the
villa
in
which
the
princess
was
imprisoned
stood
the
two
sentinels
one
beneath
the
window
the
other
before
the
door
there
were
icicles
upon
their
beards
they
were
so
shrouded
in
white
they
had
the
look
of
snow
men
built
by
schoolboys
their
coats
of
frieze
could
not
keep
out
the
searching
sleet
nor
their
caps
protect
their
ears
from
the
intolerable
cold
their
hands
were
so
numbed
they
could
not
feel
the
muskets
they
held
the
sentinel
before
the
door
suffered
the
most
for
whereas
his
companion
beneath
the
window
had
nothing
but
the
house
wall
before
his
eyes
he
on
his
part
could
see
on
the
other
side
of
the
alley
of
trees
the
red
blinds
of
the
white
chamois
that
inn
which
the
chevalier
de
george
had
mentioned
to
charles
wogan
the
red
blinds
shone
very
cheery
and
comfortable
upon
that
stormy
night
the
sentinel
envied
the
men
gathered
in
the
warmth
and
light
behind
them
and
cursed
his
own
miserable
lot
as
heartily
as
the
woman
in
the
porch
did
hers
the
red
blinds
made
it
unendurable
he
left
his
post
and
joined
his
companion
rudolf
he
said
bawling
into
his
ear
come
with
me
our
birds
will
not
fly
away
the
two
sentries
came
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
stared
at
the
blinds
what
a
night
cried
rudolf
not
a
citizen
would
thrust
his
nose
out
of
doors
not
even
the
little
chateaudoux
sweetheart
replied
the
other
with
a
grin
they
stared
again
at
the
red
blinds
and
in
a
lull
of
the
wind
a
clock
struck
nine
there
is
an
hour
before
the
magistrate
comes
said
rudolf
you
take
that
hour
said
his
companion
i
will
have
the
hour
after
the
magistrate
has
gone
rudolf
ran
across
to
the
inn
the
sentinel
at
the
door
remained
behind
both
men
were
pleased
rudolf
because
he
had
his
hour
immediately
his
because
once
the
magistrate
had
come
and
gone
he
would
take
as
long
as
he
pleased
meanwhile
the
man
and
woman
hand
in
hand
drew
nearer
to
the
villa
but
very
slowly
for
apart
from
the
weather
hindrances
the
woman
anger
had
grown
she
stopped
she
fell
down
when
there
was
no
need
to
fall
she
wept
she
struggled
to
free
her
hand
and
finally
when
they
had
taken
shelter
beneath
a
portico
she
sank
down
on
the
stone
steps
and
with
many
oaths
and
many
tears
refused
to
budge
a
foot
strangely
enough
it
was
not
so
much
the
inclemency
of
the
night
or
the
danger
of
the
enterprise
which
provoked
this
obstinacy
as
some
outrage
and
dishonour
to
her
figure
you
may
talk
all
night
she
cried
between
her
sobs
about
and
his
beautiful
german
they
can
go
hang
for
me
i
am
only
a
servant
i
know
i
am
poor
i
admit
it
but
poverty
is
a
crime
it
gives
no
one
the
right
to
make
a
dwarf
of
me
no
no
this
as
wogan
bent
down
to
lift
her
from
the
ground
plague
on
you
all
i
will
sit
here
and
die
and
when
i
am
found
frozen
and
dead
perhaps
you
will
be
sorry
for
your
cruelty
to
a
poor
girl
who
wanted
nothing
better
than
to
serve
you
here
jenny
was
so
moved
by
the
piteousness
of
her
fate
that
her
tears
broke
out
again
she
wept
loudly
wogan
was
in
an
extremity
of
alarm
lest
someone
should
pass
or
the
people
of
the
house
be
aroused
he
tried
most
tenderly
to
comfort
her
she
would
have
none
of
the
consolations
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
raised
her
to
her
feet
she
swore
more
loudly
than
she
had
wept
she
kicked
at
his
legs
she
struck
at
his
head
with
her
fist
in
another
moment
she
would
surely
have
cried
murder
wogan
had
to
let
her
sink
back
upon
the
steps
where
she
fell
to
whimpering
i
am
not
beautiful
i
know
i
never
boasted
that
i
was
but
i
have
a
figure
and
limbs
that
a
painter
would
die
to
paint
and
what
do
you
make
of
me
a
maggot
a
thing
all
body
like
a
nasty
bear
oh
curse
the
day
that
i
set
out
with
such
tyrants
a
pretty
figure
of
fun
i
should
make
before
your
beautiful
german
covered
with
mud
to
the
knees
no
you
shall
hang
me
first
why
could
do
his
own
work
the
ninny
i
hate
him
he
tall
enough
the
great
donkey
but
no
i
must
do
it
who
am
shorter
and
even
then
not
short
enough
for
him
and
you
but
you
must
drag
me
through
the
dirt
without
heels
wogan
let
her
run
on
he
was
at
his
wits
end
what
to
do
all
this
turmoil
these
tears
these
oaths
and
blows
came
from
nothing
more
serious
than
this
that
jenny
to
make
her
height
less
remarkable
must
wear
no
heels
it
was
ludicrous
it
was
absurd
but
none
the
less
the
whole
expedition
carried
to
the
very
point
of
completion
must
fail
utterly
and
irretrievably
fail
because
jenny
would
not
for
one
day
go
without
her
heels
the
princess
must
remain
in
her
prison
at
innspruck
the
chevalier
must
lose
his
wife
the
exertions
of
wogan
and
his
friends
their
risks
their
ingenuity
must
bear
no
fruit
because
jenny
would
not
show
herself
three
inches
short
of
her
ordinary
height
had
warned
him
there
would
be
a
difficulty
but
that
the
difficulty
should
become
an
absolute
hindrance
should
spoil
a
scheme
of
so
much
consequence
that
was
inconceivable
yet
there
was
jenny
sobbing
her
heart
out
on
the
steps
not
half
a
mile
from
the
villa
the
minutes
were
passing
the
inconceivable
thing
was
true
wogan
could
have
torn
his
hair
in
the
rage
of
his
despair
he
could
have
laughed
out
loudly
and
passionately
until
even
on
that
stormy
night
he
brought
the
guard
he
thought
of
the
perils
he
had
run
the
difficulties
he
had
surmounted
he
had
outwitted
the
countess
de
berg
and
lady
featherstone
he
had
persuaded
the
reluctant
prince
sobieski
he
had
foiled
his
enemies
on
the
road
to
schlestadt
he
had
made
his
plans
he
had
gathered
his
friends
he
had
crept
out
with
them
from
strasbourg
yet
in
the
end
they
had
come
to
innspruck
to
be
foiled
because
jenny
would
not
go
without
her
heels
wogan
could
have
wept
like
jenny
but
he
did
not
on
the
contrary
he
sat
down
by
her
side
on
the
steps
and
took
her
hand
gentle
as
a
sheep
you
are
in
the
right
of
it
jenny
said
he
in
a
most
remorseful
voice
jenny
looked
up
yes
he
continued
i
was
in
the
wrong
is
the
most
selfish
man
in
the
whole
world
cowardly
too
but
there
never
was
a
selfish
man
who
was
not
at
heart
a
bit
of
a
coward
sure
enough
sooner
or
later
the
cowardice
comes
out
it
is
a
preposterous
thing
that
should
think
that
you
and
i
are
going
to
rescue
his
heiress
for
him
while
he
sits
at
his
ease
by
the
inn
fire
no
let
us
go
back
to
him
and
tell
him
to
his
face
the
selfish
cowardly
man
he
is
it
seemed
however
that
jenny
was
not
entirely
pleased
to
hear
her
own
sentiments
so
frankly
uttered
by
wogan
besides
he
seemed
to
exaggerate
them
for
she
said
with
a
little
reluctance
i
would
not
say
that
he
was
a
coward
but
i
would
exclaimed
wogan
hotly
moreover
i
do
with
all
my
heart
i
say
it
a
great
lubberly
monster
of
a
coward
he
is
envious
too
jenny
jenny
had
by
this
time
stopped
weeping
why
envious
she
asked
with
an
accent
of
rebellion
which
was
very
much
to
wogan
taste
it
as
plain
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
why
should
he
make
a
dwarf
of
you
jenny
for
it
the
truth
he
has
done
that
he
has
made
a
little
dwarf
out
of
the
finest
girl
in
the
land
by
robbing
her
of
her
heels
jenny
was
on
the
point
of
interrupting
with
some
indignation
but
wogan
would
not
listen
to
her
a
dwarf
he
continued
it
was
your
own
word
jenny
i
could
say
nothing
to
comfort
you
when
you
spoke
it
for
it
was
so
true
and
suitable
an
epithet
a
little
dwarf
he
has
made
of
you
all
body
and
no
legs
like
a
bear
a
of
course
and
why
if
it
is
not
that
he
envies
you
your
figure
and
is
jealous
of
it
in
a
mean
and
discreditable
way
sure
he
wants
to
have
all
the
looks
and
to
appear
quite
incomparable
to
the
eyes
of
his
beautiful
german
so
he
makes
a
dwarf
of
you
a
little
bear
dwarf
jenny
however
had
heard
this
phrase
often
enough
by
now
she
interrupted
wogan
hotly
and
it
seemed
her
anger
was
now
as
much
directed
against
him
as
it
had
been
before
against
he
is
not
envious
said
she
a
fine
friend
he
has
in
you
i
am
thinking
he
has
no
need
to
be
envious
captain
could
carry
me
to
the
house
in
his
arms
if
he
wished
which
is
more
than
you
could
do
if
you
tried
till
midday
and
she
turned
her
shoulder
to
wogan
who
in
no
way
abashed
by
her
contempt
cried
triumphantly
but
he
did
wish
he
let
you
drag
through
the
mud
and
snow
without
so
much
as
a
patten
to
keep
you
off
the
ground
why
tell
me
that
jenny
why
did
he
wish
jenny
was
silent
you
see
if
he
is
not
envious
he
is
at
all
events
a
coward
argued
wogan
else
he
would
have
run
his
own
risks
and
come
in
your
stead
but
that
would
not
have
served
cried
jenny
it
was
her
turn
now
to
speak
triumphantly
how
could
have
run
away
with
his
heiress
and
at
the
same
time
remained
behind
in
her
bed
to
escape
suspicion
as
i
am
to
do
i
had
forgotten
that
to
be
sure
said
wogan
meekly
jenny
laughed
derisively
is
the
man
with
the
head
on
his
shoulders
said
she
and
a
pitiful
calculating
head
it
is
exclaimed
wogan
think
of
the
inconvenience
of
your
position
when
you
are
discovered
think
of
the
angry
uncle
has
thought
of
him
and
so
keeps
out
of
his
way
here
a
nice
world
where
hulking
shapeless
giants
like
hide
themselves
from
angry
uncles
behind
a
petticoats
bah
we
will
go
back
and
kick
wogan
rose
to
his
feet
jenny
did
not
move
she
sat
and
laughed
scornfully
kick
you
might
once
if
he
happened
to
be
asleep
but
he
would
take
you
up
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
the
legs
and
beat
your
face
against
your
knees
until
you
were
dead
besides
what
do
i
care
for
an
angry
uncle
i
am
well
paid
to
put
up
with
his
insults
well
paid
said
wogan
with
a
sneer
a
hundred
guineas
and
a
damask
gown
three
hundred
guineas
and
a
gown
all
lace
and
gold
tags
would
not
be
enough
besides
i
wager
he
has
not
paid
you
a
farthing
cheat
you
jenny
he
a
rare
bite
is
between
you
and
me
jenny
he
is
a
beggarly
fellow
he
has
already
paid
me
half
cried
jenny
it
was
no
knowledge
to
wogan
who
however
counterfeited
a
deal
of
surprise
well
said
he
he
has
only
done
it
to
cheat
you
the
more
easily
of
the
other
fifty
we
will
go
straight
back
and
tell
him
that
it
costs
three
hundred
guineas
money
down
and
the
best
gown
in
paris
to
turn
a
fine
figure
of
a
girl
into
a
he
leaned
down
and
took
jenny
by
the
arm
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
twisted
herself
free
no
she
said
you
can
go
back
if
you
will
and
show
him
what
a
good
friend
you
are
to
him
but
i
go
on
the
poor
captain
shall
have
one
person
in
the
world
though
she
only
a
servant
to
help
him
when
he
wants
thus
wogan
won
the
victory
but
he
was
most
careful
to
conceal
it
he
walked
by
her
side
humble
as
a
whipped
dog
if
he
had
to
point
out
the
way
he
did
it
with
the
most
penitent
air
when
he
offered
his
hand
to
help
her
over
a
and
she
struck
it
aside
he
merely
bowed
his
head
as
though
her
contempt
was
well
deserved
he
even
whispered
in
her
ear
in
a
trembling
voice
jenny
you
will
not
say
a
word
to
about
the
remarks
i
made
of
him
he
is
a
strong
hasty
man
i
know
not
what
might
come
of
it
jenny
sneered
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
would
not
speak
to
wogan
any
more
and
so
they
came
silently
into
the
avenue
of
trees
between
the
white
chamois
and
the
villa
the
windows
in
the
front
of
the
villa
were
dark
and
through
the
blinding
wogan
could
not
have
distinguished
the
position
of
the
house
at
all
but
for
the
red
blinds
of
the
tavern
opposite
which
shone
out
upon
the
night
and
gave
the
snow
falling
before
them
a
tinge
of
pink
wogan
crept
nearer
to
the
house
and
heard
the
sentinel
stamping
in
the
snow
he
came
back
to
jenny
and
pointed
the
sentinel
out
to
her
give
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
so
far
as
you
can
judge
then
pass
the
sentinel
and
go
up
the
steps
into
the
house
the
sentinel
is
prepared
for
your
coming
and
if
he
stops
you
you
must
say
in
a
whisper
and
he
will
understand
you
will
find
the
door
of
the
house
open
and
a
man
waiting
for
you
jenny
made
no
answer
but
wogan
was
sure
of
her
now
he
left
her
standing
beneath
the
dripping
trees
and
crept
towards
the
side
of
the
house
a
sentry
was
posted
beneath
her
highness
windows
and
through
those
windows
he
had
to
climb
he
needed
that
quarter
of
an
hour
to
wait
for
a
suitable
moment
when
the
sentry
would
be
at
the
far
end
of
his
beat
but
that
sentry
was
fuddling
himself
with
a
vile
spirit
distilled
from
the
gentian
flower
in
the
kitchen
of
the
white
chamois
wogan
creeping
stealthily
through
the
found
the
side
of
the
house
unguarded
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
were
dark
those
on
the
first
floor
which
lighted
her
highness
apartments
were
ablaze
he
noticed
with
a
pang
of
dismay
that
one
of
those
lighted
windows
was
wide
open
to
the
storm
he
wondered
whether
it
meant
that
the
princess
had
been
removed
to
another
lodging
he
climbed
on
the
sill
of
the
lower
window
by
the
side
of
that
window
a
stone
pillar
ran
up
the
side
of
the
house
to
the
windows
on
the
first
floor
wogan
had
taken
note
of
that
pillar
months
back
when
he
was
hawking
chattels
in
innspruck
he
set
his
hands
about
it
and
got
a
grip
with
his
foot
against
the
sash
of
the
lower
window
he
was
just
raising
himself
when
he
heard
a
noise
above
him
he
dropped
back
to
the
ground
and
stood
in
the
fixed
attitude
of
a
sentinel
a
head
appeared
at
the
window
a
woman
head
the
light
was
behind
within
the
room
so
that
wogan
could
not
see
the
face
but
the
shape
of
the
head
its
gracious
poise
upon
the
young
shoulders
the
curve
of
the
neck
the
bright
hair
drawn
backwards
from
the
brows
here
were
marks
wogan
could
not
mistake
they
had
been
present
before
his
eyes
these
many
months
the
head
at
the
open
window
was
the
head
of
the
princess
wogan
felt
a
thrill
run
through
his
blood
to
a
lover
the
sight
of
his
mistress
is
always
unexpected
though
he
foreknows
the
very
moment
of
her
coming
to
wogan
the
sight
of
his
queen
had
the
like
effect
he
had
not
seen
her
since
he
had
left
ohlau
two
years
before
with
her
promise
to
marry
the
chevalier
it
seemed
to
him
though
for
this
he
had
lived
and
worked
up
early
and
down
late
for
so
long
a
miraculous
thing
that
he
should
see
her
now
she
leaned
forward
and
peered
downwards
into
the
lane
the
light
streamed
out
bathing
her
head
and
shoulders
wogan
could
see
the
snow
fall
upon
her
dark
hair
and
whiten
it
it
fell
too
upon
her
neck
but
that
it
could
not
whiten
she
leaned
out
into
the
darkness
and
wogan
set
foot
again
upon
the
lower
at
the
same
moment
another
head
appeared
beside
clementina
and
a
sharp
cry
rang
out
a
cry
of
terror
then
both
heads
disappeared
and
a
heavy
curtain
swung
across
the
window
shutting
the
light
in
wogan
remained
motionless
his
heart
sinking
with
alarm
had
that
cry
been
heard
had
the
wind
carried
it
to
the
sentry
at
the
door
he
waited
but
no
sound
of
running
footsteps
came
to
his
ears
the
cry
had
been
lost
in
the
storm
he
was
now
so
near
to
success
that
dangers
which
a
month
ago
would
have
seemed
of
small
account
showed
most
menacing
and
fatal
it
was
the
who
cried
out
he
thought
and
was
reminded
that
the
need
of
persuasions
was
not
ended
for
the
night
with
the
conquest
of
jenny
he
had
to
convince
the
of
his
authority
without
a
line
of
prince
sobieski
writing
to
support
him
he
had
to
overcome
her
timidity
but
he
was
prepared
for
the
encounter
he
had
foreseen
it
and
had
an
argument
ready
for
the
though
he
would
have
preferred
to
wring
the
old
lady
neck
her
cry
might
spoil
everything
however
it
had
not
been
heard
and
since
it
had
not
been
heard
wogan
was
disposed
to
forgive
it
for
the
window
was
still
open
and
now
that
the
curtain
was
drawn
no
ray
of
light
escaped
from
the
room
to
betray
the
man
who
climbed
into
it
chapter
xiii
meanwhile
within
the
room
the
clung
to
clementina
the
terror
which
her
sharp
cry
had
expressed
was
visible
in
her
strained
and
startled
face
her
eyes
bright
with
terror
stared
at
the
drawn
curtain
she
could
not
avert
them
she
still
must
gaze
fascinated
by
her
fears
and
her
dry
whispering
lips
were
tremulous
heaven
have
mercy
she
whispered
shut
the
window
shut
it
fast
and
as
clementina
moved
in
surprise
she
clung
the
closer
to
her
daughter
no
do
not
leave
me
come
away
jesu
here
are
we
alone
two
women
mother
said
clementina
soothing
her
and
gently
stroking
her
hair
as
though
she
in
truth
was
the
mother
and
the
mother
her
daughter
no
cause
for
fear
no
cause
for
fear
i
saw
him
the
sentry
he
is
climbing
up
ah
and
again
her
voice
rose
to
a
cry
as
wogan
foot
grated
on
the
hush
mother
a
cry
will
ruin
us
it
not
the
sentinel
said
clementina
clementina
was
laughing
and
by
her
laughter
the
was
in
some
measure
reassured
who
is
it
then
she
asked
can
you
not
guess
said
clementina
incredulously
it
is
so
evident
yet
i
would
not
have
you
guess
it
is
my
secret
my
discovery
i
tell
you
she
heard
a
man
behind
the
curtain
spring
lightly
from
the
window
to
the
floor
she
raised
her
voice
that
he
might
know
she
had
divined
him
your
sentinel
is
the
one
man
who
has
the
right
to
rescue
me
your
sentinel
the
king
at
that
moment
wogan
pushed
aside
the
curtain
no
your
highness
said
he
but
the
king
servant
the
dropped
into
a
chair
and
looked
at
her
visitor
with
despair
it
was
not
the
sentinel
to
be
sure
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
wogan
whom
she
knew
for
a
very
insistent
man
with
a
great
liking
for
his
own
way
she
drew
little
comfort
from
wogan
coming
it
seemed
too
that
he
was
not
very
welcome
to
clementina
for
she
drew
back
a
step
and
in
a
voice
which
dropped
and
had
a
tremble
of
disappointment
wogan
she
said
the
king
is
well
served
and
she
stood
there
without
so
much
as
offering
him
her
hand
wogan
had
not
counted
on
so
cold
a
greeting
but
he
understood
the
reason
and
was
not
sure
but
what
he
approved
of
it
after
all
she
had
encountered
perils
on
the
king
account
she
had
some
sort
of
a
justification
to
believe
the
king
would
do
the
like
for
her
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
or
indeed
to
anyone
before
but
now
that
he
saw
the
chosen
woman
so
plainly
wounded
he
felt
a
trifle
hot
against
his
king
for
having
disappointed
her
he
set
his
wits
to
work
to
dispel
the
disappointment
your
highness
the
truth
is
there
are
great
matters
brewing
in
spain
his
majesty
was
needed
there
most
urgently
he
had
to
decide
between
innspruck
and
cadiz
and
it
seemed
that
he
would
honour
your
great
confidence
in
him
and
at
the
same
time
serve
you
best
clementina
would
not
allow
him
to
complete
the
sentence
her
cheek
flushed
and
she
said
quickly
you
are
right
wogan
the
king
is
right
mine
was
a
girl
thought
i
am
ashamed
of
it
and
she
frankly
gave
him
her
hand
wogan
was
fairly
well
pleased
with
his
apology
for
his
king
it
was
not
quite
the
truth
no
doubt
but
it
had
spared
clementina
a
trifle
of
humiliation
and
had
the
king
in
her
thoughts
he
bent
over
her
hand
and
would
have
kissed
it
but
she
stopped
him
no
said
she
an
honest
handclasp
if
you
please
for
no
woman
can
have
ever
lived
who
had
a
truer
friend
and
wogan
looking
into
her
frank
eyes
was
not
after
all
nearly
so
well
pleased
with
the
untruth
he
had
told
her
she
was
an
uncomfortable
woman
to
go
about
with
shifts
and
contrivances
her
open
face
with
its
broad
forehead
and
the
clear
steady
eyes
of
darkest
blue
claimed
truth
as
a
prerogative
the
blush
which
had
faded
from
her
cheeks
appeared
on
his
and
he
began
to
babble
some
foolish
word
about
his
unworthiness
when
the
interrupted
him
in
a
grudging
voice
wogan
you
were
to
bring
a
written
authority
from
the
prince
my
husband
wogan
drew
himself
up
straight
your
highness
said
he
with
a
bow
of
the
utmost
respect
i
was
given
such
an
authority
the
held
out
her
hand
will
you
give
it
me
i
said
that
i
was
given
such
an
authority
but
i
have
it
no
longer
i
was
attacked
on
my
way
from
ohlau
there
were
five
men
against
me
all
of
whom
desired
that
letter
the
room
was
small
i
could
not
run
away
neither
had
i
much
space
wherein
to
resist
five
men
i
knew
that
were
i
killed
and
that
letter
found
on
me
your
highness
would
thereafter
be
too
surely
guarded
to
make
escape
possible
and
his
highness
prince
sobieski
would
himself
incur
the
emperor
hostility
so
when
i
had
made
sure
that
those
five
men
were
joined
against
me
i
twisted
that
letter
into
a
taper
and
before
their
faces
lit
my
pipe
with
it
clementina
eyes
were
fixed
steadily
and
intently
upon
wogan
face
when
he
ended
she
drew
a
deep
breath
but
otherwise
she
did
not
move
the
however
was
unmistakably
relieved
she
spoke
with
a
kindliness
she
had
never
shown
before
to
wogan
she
even
smiled
at
him
in
a
friendly
way
we
do
not
doubt
you
wogan
but
that
written
letter
giving
my
daughter
leave
to
go
i
needs
must
have
before
i
let
her
go
a
authority
i
can
not
take
that
upon
myself
clementina
took
a
quick
step
across
to
her
mother
side
you
did
not
hear
she
said
i
heard
indeed
that
wogan
had
burnt
the
letter
but
under
what
stress
and
to
spare
my
father
and
to
leave
me
still
a
grain
of
hope
mother
this
gentleman
has
run
great
risks
for
me
how
great
i
did
not
know
even
now
in
this
one
instance
we
can
only
guess
and
still
fall
short
of
the
mark
the
visibly
stiffened
with
maternal
authority
my
child
without
some
sure
sign
the
prince
consents
you
must
not
go
clementina
looked
towards
wogan
for
assistance
wogan
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
that
sure
sign
i
have
said
he
it
is
a
surer
sign
than
any
written
letter
for
handwriting
may
always
be
counterfeit
this
could
never
be
and
he
held
out
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
turquoise
which
the
prince
had
given
him
on
new
year
day
it
is
a
jewel
unique
in
all
the
world
and
the
prince
gave
it
me
it
is
a
jewel
he
treasured
not
only
for
its
value
but
its
history
yet
he
gave
it
me
it
was
won
by
the
great
king
john
of
poland
and
remains
as
a
memorial
of
the
most
glorious
day
in
all
that
warrior
glorious
life
yet
his
son
gave
it
me
with
his
own
hands
he
put
it
into
mine
to
prove
to
me
with
what
confidence
he
trusted
your
highness
daughter
to
my
care
that
confidence
was
written
large
in
the
letter
i
burnt
but
i
am
thinking
it
is
engraved
for
ever
upon
this
stone
the
took
the
reluctantly
and
turned
it
over
and
over
she
was
silent
clementina
answered
for
her
i
am
ready
she
said
and
she
pointed
to
a
tiny
bundle
on
a
chair
in
which
a
few
clothes
were
wrapped
my
jewels
are
packed
in
the
bundle
but
i
can
leave
them
behind
me
if
needs
be
wogan
lifted
up
the
bundle
and
laughed
your
highness
teaches
a
lesson
to
soldiers
for
there
is
never
a
knapsack
but
can
hold
this
and
still
have
half
its
space
to
spare
the
front
door
is
unlatched
chateaudoux
is
watching
in
the
hall
and
the
hall
unlighted
yes
jenny
should
be
here
in
a
minute
and
before
she
comes
i
must
tell
you
she
does
not
know
the
importance
of
our
undertaking
she
is
the
servant
to
misset
who
attends
your
highness
into
italy
we
did
not
let
her
into
the
secret
we
made
up
a
comedy
in
which
you
have
your
parts
to
play
your
highness
and
he
turned
to
clementina
is
a
rich
austrian
heiress
deeply
enamoured
of
captain
lucius
captain
lucius
exclaimed
the
mother
in
horror
my
daughter
enamoured
of
a
captain
lucius
he
is
one
of
my
three
companions
said
wogan
imperturbably
moreover
he
is
six
foot
four
the
most
creditable
lover
in
the
world
well
said
clementina
with
a
laugh
i
am
deeply
enamoured
of
the
engaging
captain
lucius
go
on
sir
your
parents
are
of
a
most
unexampled
cruelty
they
will
not
smile
upon
the
fascinating
but
have
locked
you
up
on
bread
and
water
until
you
shall
agree
to
marry
a
wealthy
but
decrepit
gentleman
of
i
will
not
cried
clementina
i
will
starve
myself
to
death
first
i
will
marry
my
six
feet
four
or
no
other
man
in
christendom
clementina
cried
her
mother
deprecatingly
but
at
this
moment
continued
wogan
there
very
properly
appears
the
fairy
godmother
in
the
person
of
a
romantical
maiden
aunt
oh
said
clementina
i
have
a
romantical
maiden
aunt
yes
said
wogan
and
turning
with
a
bow
to
the
your
highness
i
she
exclaimed
starting
up
in
her
chair
your
highness
has
written
an
encouraging
letter
to
captain
resumed
wogan
the
gasped
a
letter
to
captain
and
she
flung
up
her
hands
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
on
the
receipt
of
the
letter
captain
gathers
his
friends
borrows
a
horse
here
a
carriage
there
and
a
hundred
guineas
from
heaven
knows
whom
comes
to
the
rescue
like
a
and
retells
the
old
story
of
how
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
as
wogan
ended
the
mother
rose
from
her
chair
it
may
have
been
that
she
revolted
at
the
part
she
was
to
play
it
may
have
been
because
a
fiercer
gust
shook
the
curtain
and
bellied
it
inwards
at
all
events
she
flung
the
curtain
aside
the
snow
drifted
through
the
open
window
onto
the
floor
outside
the
open
window
it
was
falling
like
a
cascade
and
the
air
was
icy
wogan
she
said
stubbornly
working
herself
into
a
heat
to
make
more
sure
of
her
resolution
my
daughter
can
not
go
if
the
sky
clears
yes
but
no
you
do
not
know
sir
being
a
man
but
my
daughter
has
fasted
through
this
lent
and
that
leaves
a
woman
weak
i
do
forbid
her
going
as
her
father
would
the
very
dogs
running
the
streets
for
food
keep
kennel
on
such
a
night
she
must
not
go
wogan
did
not
give
way
though
he
felt
a
qualm
of
despair
knowing
all
the
stubbornness
of
which
the
weak
are
capable
knowing
how
impervious
to
facts
or
arguments
your
highness
he
said
quickly
we
are
not
birds
of
passage
to
rule
our
flight
by
seasons
we
must
take
the
moment
when
it
comes
and
it
comes
now
your
daughter
can
escape
for
here
a
night
made
for
an
escape
and
for
my
part
cried
clementina
i
would
the
snow
fell
faster
she
crossed
to
the
open
window
and
held
out
her
hands
to
catch
the
flakes
would
they
did
not
melt
i
believe
heaven
sends
the
snow
to
shelter
me
it
the
white
canopy
spread
above
my
head
that
i
may
go
in
state
to
meet
my
king
she
stood
eager
and
exultant
her
eyes
shining
her
cheek
on
fire
her
voice
thrilling
with
pride
she
seemed
not
to
feel
the
cold
she
welcomed
the
hardships
of
wind
and
falling
snow
as
her
opportunity
she
desired
not
only
for
escape
but
also
to
endure
wogan
looked
her
over
from
head
to
foot
filled
with
pride
and
admiration
he
had
made
no
mistake
he
had
plucked
this
rose
of
the
world
to
give
to
his
king
his
eyes
said
it
and
the
girl
reading
them
drew
a
breath
and
rippled
out
a
laugh
of
gladness
that
his
trusted
servant
was
so
well
content
with
her
but
the
stood
unmoved
my
daughter
can
not
go
she
repeated
resentfully
i
do
forbid
it
wogan
had
his
one
argument
this
one
argument
was
his
last
resource
he
had
chosen
it
carefully
with
an
eye
to
the
woman
whom
it
was
to
persuade
it
was
not
couched
as
an
inducement
it
did
not
claim
the
discharge
of
an
obligation
it
was
not
a
reply
to
any
definite
objection
such
arguments
would
only
have
confirmed
her
in
her
stubbornness
he
made
accordingly
an
appeal
to
sentiment
your
highness
daughter
said
he
spoke
a
minute
since
of
the
hazards
my
friends
and
i
have
run
to
compass
her
escape
as
regards
four
of
us
the
words
reached
beyond
our
deserts
for
we
are
men
such
hazards
are
our
portion
they
are
seldom
lightened
by
so
high
an
aim
but
the
fifth
the
words
however
kind
were
still
below
that
fifth
one
merits
for
the
fifth
is
a
woman
i
know
with
all
my
heart
i
thank
her
with
all
my
heart
i
pity
her
but
there
is
one
thing
your
highness
does
not
know
she
runs
our
risks
the
risk
of
capture
the
risk
of
the
night
the
storm
the
snow
she
a
woman
by
nature
timid
and
frail
yet
with
never
in
all
her
life
so
great
a
reason
for
timidity
or
so
much
frailty
of
health
as
now
we
venture
our
lives
but
she
ventures
more
the
mother
bowed
her
head
clementina
looked
fixedly
at
wogan
speak
plainly
my
friend
she
said
there
are
no
children
here
madam
i
need
but
quote
to
you
the
words
her
husband
used
for
my
part
i
think
that
nobler
words
were
never
spoken
and
with
her
whole
heart
she
repeats
them
they
are
these
boy
would
only
live
to
serve
his
king
why
should
he
not
serve
his
king
before
he
lives
the
mother
was
still
silent
but
wogan
could
see
that
the
tears
overbrimmed
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
clementina
was
silent
for
a
while
too
and
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
on
wogan
then
she
said
gently
her
name
wogan
told
her
it
and
she
said
no
more
but
it
was
plain
that
she
would
never
forget
it
that
she
had
written
it
upon
her
heart
wogan
waited
looking
to
the
princess
who
drying
her
tears
rose
from
her
chair
and
said
with
great
and
unexpected
dignity
how
comes
it
sir
that
with
such
servants
your
king
still
does
not
sit
upon
his
throne
my
daughter
shall
not
fall
below
the
great
example
set
to
her
my
fears
are
shamed
by
it
my
daughter
goes
with
you
it
was
time
that
she
consented
for
even
as
wogan
flung
himself
upon
his
knee
and
raised
her
hand
chateaudoux
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
finger
on
his
lips
and
behind
him
one
could
hear
a
voice
grumbling
and
cursing
on
the
stairs
jenny
said
wogan
and
jenny
stumbled
into
the
room
quiet
said
he
you
will
wake
the
house
well
if
you
had
to
walk
upstairs
in
the
dark
in
these
horrible
shoes
oh
jenny
your
cloak
quick
take
the
thing
a
good
riddance
to
it
it
dripping
wet
and
weighs
a
ton
dripping
wet
moaned
the
mother
i
shall
not
wear
it
long
said
clementina
advancing
from
the
embrasure
of
the
window
jenny
turned
and
looked
her
over
critically
from
head
to
foot
then
she
turned
away
without
a
word
and
let
the
cloak
fall
to
the
ground
it
fell
about
her
feet
she
kicked
it
viciously
away
and
at
the
same
time
she
kicked
off
one
of
those
shoes
of
which
she
so
much
complained
jenny
was
never
the
woman
to
mince
her
language
and
she
was
in
her
surliest
mood
so
she
swore
simply
and
heartily
to
the
mother
utter
astonishment
and
indignation
damn
she
said
hobbling
across
the
room
to
the
corner
whither
her
shoe
had
fallen
there
there
old
lady
do
hold
your
hands
to
your
ears
as
though
a
clean
oath
would
poison
them
the
fell
back
in
her
chair
does
she
speak
to
me
she
asked
helplessly
yes
said
wogan
and
turning
to
jenny
this
is
the
aunt
jenny
turned
to
clementina
who
was
picking
the
cloak
from
the
floor
and
you
are
the
beautiful
heiress
she
said
sourly
well
if
you
are
going
to
put
that
wet
cloak
on
your
shoulders
i
wish
you
joy
of
the
first
kiss
gives
you
when
you
jump
into
his
arms
the
screamed
wogan
hastened
to
interfere
jenny
there
the
bedroom
to
bed
with
you
and
he
took
out
his
watch
at
once
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
affright
wogan
had
miscalculated
the
time
which
he
would
require
it
had
taken
longer
than
he
had
anticipated
to
reach
the
villa
against
the
storm
his
conflict
with
jenny
in
the
portico
had
consumed
valuable
minutes
he
had
been
at
some
pains
to
the
jenny
herself
amongst
the
trees
in
the
darkness
had
waited
more
than
the
quarter
of
an
hour
demanded
of
her
wogan
himself
absorbed
each
moment
in
that
particular
business
now
bending
all
his
wits
to
vanquish
jenny
now
to
vanquish
the
even
wogan
had
neglected
how
the
time
sped
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
minutes
to
ten
and
at
ten
the
magistrate
would
be
knocking
at
the
door
i
am
ready
said
clementina
drawing
the
wet
cloak
about
her
shoulders
and
its
hood
over
her
head
she
barely
shivered
under
its
wet
heaviness
there
one
more
thing
to
be
done
before
you
go
said
wogan
but
before
he
could
say
what
that
one
thing
was
jenny
who
had
now
recovered
her
shoe
ran
across
the
room
and
took
the
beautiful
heiress
by
both
hands
jenny
was
impulsive
by
nature
the
distress
and
clementina
fearlessness
made
her
suddenly
ashamed
that
she
had
spoken
so
sourly
there
there
old
lady
she
said
soothingly
do
you
fret
they
are
very
good
friends
your
niece
is
going
with
then
she
drew
clementina
close
to
her
i
do
wonder
they
are
all
mad
about
you
for
i
but
say
you
are
very
handsome
and
richly
worth
the
pains
you
have
occasioned
us
she
kissed
clementina
plump
upon
the
cheek
and
whispered
in
her
ear
wo
mind
the
wet
cloak
my
dear
when
he
sees
you
clementina
laughed
happily
and
returned
her
kiss
with
no
less
sincerity
if
with
less
noise
quick
jenny
said
wogan
to
bed
with
you
he
pointed
to
the
door
which
led
to
the
princess
bedroom
now
you
must
write
a
letter
he
added
to
clementina
in
a
low
voice
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
upon
jenny
a
letter
to
your
mother
relieving
her
of
all
complicity
in
your
escape
her
highness
will
find
it
night
slipped
under
the
cover
of
her
toilette
clementina
ran
to
a
table
and
taking
up
a
pen
you
think
of
everything
she
said
perhaps
you
have
written
the
letter
wogan
pulled
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
fob
i
scribbled
down
a
few
dutiful
sentiments
said
he
as
we
drove
down
from
nazareth
thinking
it
might
save
time
mother
exclaimed
clementina
not
content
with
contriving
my
escape
he
will
write
my
letters
to
you
well
sir
let
us
hear
what
you
have
made
of
it
wogan
dictated
a
most
beautiful
letter
in
which
a
mother
claims
for
obedience
were
strongly
set
out
as
a
justification
one
must
suppose
for
a
daughter
disobedience
but
clementina
was
betrothed
to
his
majesty
king
james
and
that
engagement
must
be
ever
the
highest
consideration
with
her
on
pain
of
forfeiting
her
honour
it
was
altogether
a
noble
and
stately
letter
written
in
formal
irreproachable
phrases
which
no
daughter
in
the
world
would
ever
have
written
to
a
mother
clementina
laughed
over
it
but
said
that
it
would
serve
wogan
looked
at
his
watch
again
it
was
then
a
quarter
to
ten
quick
said
he
your
highness
will
wait
for
me
under
the
fourth
tree
of
the
avenue
counting
from
the
end
he
left
the
mother
and
daughter
alone
that
his
presence
might
not
check
the
tenderness
of
their
farewell
and
went
down
the
stairs
into
the
dark
hall
chateaudoux
was
waiting
there
with
his
teeth
chattering
in
the
extremity
of
his
alarm
wogan
unlatched
the
door
very
carefully
and
saw
through
the
chink
the
sentry
standing
by
the
steps
the
snow
still
fell
he
was
glad
to
note
the
only
light
was
a
white
glimmering
from
the
waste
of
snow
upon
the
ground
you
must
go
out
with
her
wogan
whispered
to
chateaudoux
and
speak
a
word
to
the
sentry
at
any
moment
the
magistrate
may
come
said
chateaudoux
though
he
trembled
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
all
the
more
reason
for
the
sentinel
to
let
your
sweetheart
run
home
at
her
quickest
step
said
wogan
and
above
him
he
heard
clementina
come
out
upon
the
landing
he
crept
up
the
stairs
to
her
here
is
my
hand
said
he
in
a
low
voice
she
laid
her
own
in
his
and
bending
towards
him
in
the
darkness
she
whispered
promise
me
it
shall
always
be
at
my
service
i
shall
need
friends
i
am
young
and
i
have
no
knowledge
promise
me
she
was
young
indeed
the
freshness
of
her
voice
its
little
tremble
of
modesty
the
earnestness
of
its
appeal
carried
her
youth
quite
home
to
wogan
heart
she
was
sweet
with
youth
wogan
felt
it
more
clearly
as
they
stood
together
in
the
darkness
than
when
he
had
seen
her
plainly
in
the
lighted
room
with
youth
mantling
her
cheeks
and
visible
in
the
buoyancy
of
her
walk
then
she
had
been
always
the
chosen
woman
wogan
could
just
see
her
eyes
steady
and
mysteriously
dark
shining
at
him
out
of
the
gloom
and
a
pang
of
remorse
suddenly
struck
through
him
that
one
step
she
was
to
take
was
across
the
threshold
of
a
prison
it
was
true
but
a
prison
familiar
and
warm
and
into
a
night
of
storm
and
darkness
and
ice
the
road
lay
before
her
into
italy
but
it
was
a
road
of
unknown
perils
through
mountains
deep
in
snow
and
this
escape
of
from
the
villa
this
thunderous
flight
with
its
hardships
and
its
dangers
which
followed
the
escape
was
only
the
symbol
of
her
life
she
stepped
from
the
shelter
of
her
girlhood
as
she
stepped
across
the
threshold
of
the
villa
into
a
womanhood
dark
with
many
trials
and
wandering
she
might
reach
the
queendom
which
was
her
due
as
the
berlin
in
which
she
was
to
travel
might
nay
surely
would
rush
one
day
from
the
gorges
into
the
plains
and
the
sunlight
of
italy
but
had
wogan
travelled
to
rome
in
gaydon
place
and
talked
with
whittington
outside
the
caprara
palace
it
is
very
likely
that
she
would
never
have
been
allowed
by
him
to
start
up
till
now
he
had
thought
only
of
her
splendid
courage
of
the
humiliation
of
her
capture
of
her
wounded
pride
she
was
the
chosen
woman
now
he
thought
of
the
girl
and
wondered
of
her
destiny
and
was
stricken
with
remorse
promise
me
she
repeated
and
her
hand
tightened
upon
his
and
clung
to
it
wogan
had
no
fine
sentiments
wherewith
to
answer
her
but
his
voice
took
a
depth
of
sincerity
and
tenderness
quite
strange
to
her
her
fingers
ceased
to
tremble
they
went
down
into
the
hall
chateaudoux
who
had
been
waiting
in
an
agony
of
impatience
opened
the
door
and
slipped
out
clementina
followed
him
the
door
was
left
ajar
behind
them
and
wogan
in
the
hall
saw
chateaudoux
speak
with
the
sentinel
saw
the
sentinel
run
hurriedly
to
clementina
saw
clementina
disappear
into
the
snow
chateaudoux
ran
back
into
the
hall
and
you
he
asked
as
he
barred
and
locked
the
door
the
magistrate
is
coming
i
saw
the
lights
of
the
guard
across
the
avenue
clementina
was
outside
in
the
storm
wogan
was
within
the
house
and
the
lights
of
the
guard
were
already
near
i
go
by
the
way
i
came
said
he
i
have
time
and
he
ran
quickly
up
the
stairs
in
the
room
he
found
the
weeping
silently
and
again
as
he
saw
this
weak
elderly
woman
left
alone
to
her
fears
and
forebodings
remorse
took
hold
on
him
courage
madam
said
he
as
he
crossed
the
room
she
goes
to
wed
a
king
sir
i
am
her
mother
replied
the
princess
gaining
at
this
moment
a
suitable
dignity
from
her
tears
i
was
wondering
not
of
the
king
but
of
the
man
the
king
conceals
you
need
not
madam
said
wogan
who
had
no
time
for
eulogies
upon
his
master
take
his
servant
loyalty
as
the
measure
of
his
merits
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
suddenly
drew
back
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
great
fear
upon
his
face
for
the
sentinel
was
back
at
his
post
wogan
dared
not
at
this
moment
risk
a
struggle
and
perhaps
an
outcry
clementina
was
waiting
under
the
avenue
of
trees
wogan
was
within
the
house
and
the
lights
of
the
guard
were
already
flaring
in
the
roadway
even
as
wogan
stood
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
he
heard
a
heavy
knocking
on
the
door
chapter
xiv
wogan
closed
the
window
cautiously
the
snow
had
drifted
through
and
lay
melting
in
a
heap
beneath
the
sill
he
drew
the
curtain
across
the
embrasure
and
then
he
crossed
to
the
bedroom
door
jenny
he
whispered
are
you
in
bed
yes
lie
close
do
not
show
your
face
nor
speak
only
groan
and
groan
most
delicately
or
we
are
lost
he
closed
the
door
upon
jenny
and
turning
about
came
face
to
face
with
the
she
stood
confronting
him
a
finger
on
her
lips
and
terror
in
her
eyes
and
he
heard
the
open
and
clang
to
below
the
magistrate
she
whispered
courage
your
highness
keep
them
from
the
bed
say
that
her
eyes
are
weak
and
can
not
bear
the
light
he
slipped
behind
the
curtain
into
the
embrasure
picturing
to
himself
the
disposition
of
the
room
lest
he
should
have
left
behind
a
trifle
to
betray
him
he
had
in
a
supreme
degree
that
gift
of
recollection
which
takes
the
form
of
a
mental
vision
he
did
not
have
to
count
over
the
details
of
the
room
he
summoned
a
picture
of
it
to
his
mind
and
saw
it
and
its
contents
from
corner
to
corner
and
thus
while
the
footsteps
yet
sounded
on
the
stair
he
saw
clementina
bundle
lying
forgotten
on
a
couch
he
darted
from
his
seized
it
and
ran
back
he
had
just
sufficient
and
not
a
second
more
time
for
the
curtain
had
not
ceased
to
swing
when
the
magistrate
knocked
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
entered
he
was
followed
by
two
soldiers
and
these
he
ordered
to
wait
without
the
door
your
highness
he
said
in
a
polite
voice
and
stopped
abruptly
it
seemed
to
wogan
behind
the
curtain
that
his
heart
stopped
at
the
same
moment
and
with
no
less
abruptness
there
was
no
evidence
of
clementina
flight
to
justify
that
sudden
silence
then
he
grew
faint
as
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
made
lady
mistake
that
his
boot
protruded
into
the
room
he
clenched
his
teeth
expecting
a
swift
step
and
the
curtain
to
be
torn
aside
the
window
was
shut
he
would
never
have
time
to
open
it
and
leap
out
and
take
his
chance
with
the
sentry
underneath
he
was
caught
in
a
trap
and
clementina
waited
for
him
in
the
avenue
under
the
fourth
tree
all
was
lost
it
seemed
and
by
his
own
folly
his
own
confidence
had
he
only
told
her
of
the
tavern
under
the
city
wall
where
the
carriage
stood
with
its
horses
harnessed
in
the
shafts
she
might
still
have
escaped
though
he
was
trapped
the
sweat
passed
down
his
face
yet
no
swift
step
was
taken
nor
was
the
curtain
torn
aside
for
within
the
room
the
magistrate
a
kindly
citizen
of
innspruck
who
had
no
liking
for
this
addition
to
his
duties
stood
gazing
at
the
with
a
respectful
pity
it
was
the
sight
of
her
face
which
had
checked
his
words
for
two
days
clementina
had
kept
her
bed
and
the
mother
tears
alarmed
him
her
highness
your
daughter
suffers
so
much
said
he
sir
it
is
little
to
be
wondered
at
the
magistrate
bowed
that
question
was
not
one
with
which
he
had
a
mind
to
meddle
she
still
lies
in
bed
said
he
and
he
crossed
to
the
door
the
mother
flung
herself
in
the
way
she
lies
in
pain
and
you
would
disturb
her
you
would
flash
your
lanterns
in
her
eyes
that
if
perchance
she
sleeps
she
may
wake
into
a
world
of
pain
sir
you
will
not
your
highness
it
is
the
mother
who
beseeches
you
sir
would
you
have
me
on
my
knees
wogan
but
this
moment
recovered
from
his
alarm
became
again
uneasy
her
highness
protested
too
much
she
played
her
part
in
the
comedy
too
strenuously
he
judged
by
the
ear
the
magistrate
had
the
quivering
face
before
his
eyes
and
his
pity
deepened
your
highness
he
said
i
must
pray
you
to
let
me
pass
i
have
general
heister
orders
to
obey
the
now
gave
wogan
reason
to
applaud
her
she
saw
that
the
magistrate
for
all
his
politeness
was
quite
inflexible
go
then
she
said
with
a
quiet
dignity
which
once
before
she
had
shown
that
evening
since
there
is
no
humiliation
to
be
spared
us
take
a
candle
sir
and
count
the
marks
of
suffering
in
my
daughter
face
and
with
her
own
hand
she
opened
the
bedroom
door
and
stood
aside
madam
i
would
not
press
my
duty
an
inch
beyond
its
limits
said
the
magistrate
i
will
stand
in
the
doorway
and
do
you
bid
your
daughter
speak
the
did
not
move
from
her
position
my
child
she
said
jenny
in
the
bedroom
groaned
and
turned
from
one
side
to
the
other
you
are
in
pain
jenny
groaned
again
the
magistrate
himself
closed
the
door
believe
me
said
he
no
one
could
more
regret
than
i
the
incivilities
to
which
i
am
compelled
he
crossed
the
room
wogan
heard
him
and
his
men
descending
the
stairs
he
heard
the
door
open
and
shut
he
heard
chateaudoux
draw
the
bolts
then
he
stepped
out
from
the
curtain
your
highness
that
was
bravely
done
said
he
and
kneeling
he
kissed
her
hand
he
went
back
into
the
embrasure
slipped
the
bundle
over
his
arm
and
opened
the
window
very
silently
he
saw
the
snow
was
still
falling
the
wind
still
moaning
about
the
crannies
and
roaring
along
the
streets
he
set
his
knee
upon
the
climbed
out
and
drew
the
window
to
behind
him
the
waited
in
the
room
with
her
hand
upon
her
heart
she
waited
it
seemed
to
her
for
an
eternity
then
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
heavy
fall
and
the
clang
of
a
musket
against
the
wall
of
the
villa
but
she
heard
no
cry
she
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
out
but
strain
her
eyes
as
she
might
she
could
distinguish
nothing
in
that
blinding
storm
she
could
not
see
the
sentinel
nor
was
this
strange
for
the
sentinel
lay
senseless
on
the
snow
against
the
and
wogan
was
already
running
down
the
avenue
under
the
fourth
tree
he
found
clementina
she
took
his
arm
and
they
set
off
together
wrestling
with
the
wind
wading
through
the
snow
it
seemed
to
clementina
that
her
companion
was
possessed
by
some
new
fear
he
said
no
single
word
to
her
he
dragged
her
with
a
fierce
grip
upon
her
wrist
if
she
stumbled
he
jerked
her
roughly
to
her
feet
she
set
her
teeth
and
kept
pace
with
him
only
once
did
she
speak
they
had
come
to
a
depression
in
the
road
where
the
melted
snow
had
made
a
wide
pool
wogan
leaped
across
it
and
said
give
me
your
hand
there
a
white
stone
midway
where
you
can
set
your
foot
the
princess
stepped
as
he
bade
her
the
stone
yielded
beneath
her
tread
and
she
stood
in
the
water
wogan
sprang
to
her
side
and
lifted
her
out
she
had
uttered
no
cry
and
now
she
only
laughed
as
she
stood
shivering
on
the
further
edge
it
was
that
low
musical
laugh
to
which
wogan
had
never
listened
without
a
thrill
of
gladness
but
it
waked
no
response
in
him
now
you
told
me
of
a
white
stone
on
which
i
might
safely
set
my
foot
she
said
well
sir
your
white
stone
was
straw
they
were
both
to
remember
these
words
afterwards
and
to
make
of
them
a
parable
but
it
seemed
that
wogan
barely
heard
them
now
come
he
said
and
taking
her
arm
he
set
off
running
again
clementina
understood
that
something
inopportune
something
terrible
had
happened
since
she
had
left
the
villa
she
asked
no
questions
she
trusted
herself
without
reserve
to
these
true
friends
who
had
striven
at
such
risks
for
her
she
desired
to
prove
to
them
that
she
was
what
they
would
have
her
be
a
girl
who
did
not
pester
them
with
inconvenient
chatter
but
who
could
keep
silence
when
silence
was
helpful
and
face
hardships
with
a
buoyant
heart
they
crossed
the
bridge
and
stopped
before
a
pair
of
high
folding
doors
they
were
the
doors
of
the
tavern
wogan
drew
a
breath
of
relief
pulled
the
bobbin
and
pushed
the
doors
open
clementina
slipped
through
and
in
darkness
she
took
a
step
forward
and
bruised
herself
against
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
wogan
closed
the
door
and
ran
to
her
side
this
way
said
he
and
held
out
his
hand
he
guided
clementina
round
the
carriage
to
a
steep
narrow
stairway
it
was
more
a
ladder
than
a
stair
fixed
against
the
inner
wall
at
the
top
of
this
stairway
shone
a
horizontal
line
of
yellow
light
wogan
led
the
princess
up
the
stairs
the
line
of
light
shone
out
beneath
a
door
wogan
opened
the
door
and
stood
aside
clementina
passed
into
a
small
bare
room
lighted
by
a
single
candle
where
misset
gaydon
and
waited
for
her
coming
not
a
word
was
said
but
their
eyes
spoke
their
admiration
of
the
woman
their
knees
expressed
their
homage
to
the
queen
there
was
a
fire
blazing
on
the
hearth
misset
had
a
dry
change
of
clothes
ready
and
warm
wogan
laid
the
princess
bundle
on
a
chair
and
with
gaydon
and
went
down
the
stairs
the
horses
he
asked
i
have
ordered
them
said
gaydon
at
the
i
will
fetch
them
and
he
hurried
off
upon
his
errand
wogan
turned
to
and
the
bill
i
have
paid
it
there
is
no
one
awake
in
the
house
no
one
but
the
landlady
good
can
you
keep
her
engaged
until
we
are
ready
to
be
sure
i
can
she
shall
never
give
a
thought
to
any
man
of
you
but
myself
passed
through
a
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
into
the
of
the
inn
wogan
gently
opened
the
big
doors
and
dragged
the
carriage
out
into
the
road
gaydon
with
the
horses
galloped
silently
up
through
the
snow
and
together
the
two
men
feverishly
harnessed
them
to
the
carriage
there
were
six
for
the
carriage
and
a
seventh
for
to
ride
the
expedition
which
wogan
and
gaydon
showed
was
matched
by
the
princess
for
while
they
were
fastening
the
last
buckles
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
opened
and
again
that
night
clementina
whispered
i
am
ready
come
replied
wogan
she
wore
a
scarlet
cloak
upon
her
shoulders
and
muffling
it
about
her
head
she
ran
down
with
misset
wogan
opened
the
lower
door
of
the
inn
and
called
for
came
running
out
before
wogan
had
ended
his
words
and
sprang
into
his
saddle
gaydon
was
already
on
the
box
with
the
reins
gathered
in
his
hand
wogan
had
the
carriage
door
open
before
clementina
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
it
was
shut
upon
her
and
her
companion
almost
before
they
were
aware
they
were
within
it
the
carriage
started
almost
before
the
door
was
shut
yet
when
it
did
start
wogan
was
beside
gaydon
upon
the
box
their
movements
indeed
occurred
with
so
exact
a
rapidity
that
though
the
hostess
at
once
followed
to
bid
her
guests
farewell
when
she
reached
the
big
doors
she
saw
only
the
back
of
the
carriage
lurching
through
the
ruts
of
snow
quick
cried
wogan
we
have
lost
too
much
time
a
bare
twenty
minutes
said
gaydon
a
good
twelve
hours
said
wogan
gaydon
lashed
the
horses
into
a
gallop
the
horses
strained
at
their
collars
the
carriage
raced
out
of
the
town
and
up
the
slopes
of
the
brenner
the
princess
clementina
had
been
rescued
from
her
prison
but
we
must
keep
her
free
cried
wogan
as
he
blew
through
his
gloves
upon
his
frozen
fingers
faster
faster
the
incline
was
steep
the
snow
clogged
the
wheels
the
horses
sank
deep
in
it
gaydon
might
ply
his
whip
as
he
would
the
carriage
might
lurch
and
leap
from
side
to
side
the
pace
was
all
too
slow
for
wogan
we
have
lost
twelve
hours
he
cried
oh
would
to
god
we
were
come
to
italy
and
turning
backwards
he
strained
his
eyes
down
through
the
darkness
and
snow
to
the
hidden
roofs
of
innspruck
almost
fearing
to
see
the
windows
from
one
end
of
the
town
to
the
other
leap
to
a
blaze
of
light
and
to
hear
a
roar
of
many
voices
warn
him
that
the
escape
was
discovered
but
the
only
cry
that
he
heard
came
from
the
lips
of
misset
who
put
her
head
from
the
carriage
and
bade
him
stop
gaydon
brought
the
horses
to
a
standstill
three
miles
out
of
innspruck
chapter
xv
wogan
jumped
down
from
his
box
and
ran
to
the
her
highness
is
ill
he
cried
in
suspense
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
returned
clementina
whose
voice
for
once
in
a
way
jarred
upon
wogan
ears
nothing
short
of
a
positive
sickness
could
justify
the
delay
what
is
it
then
he
asked
curtly
almost
roughly
of
misset
you
carried
a
packet
for
her
highness
it
is
left
behind
at
the
tavern
wogan
stamped
impatiently
on
the
ground
and
for
this
for
a
petticoat
or
two
you
hinder
us
he
cried
in
a
heat
there
no
petticoat
in
the
world
though
it
were
so
stiff
with
gold
that
it
stood
on
end
of
itself
that
worth
a
single
second
of
the
next
hours
but
it
contains
her
highness
jewels
wogan
impatience
became
an
exasperation
were
all
women
at
heart
then
no
better
than
indian
squaws
a
string
of
beads
outweighed
the
sacrifices
of
friends
and
the
chance
of
a
crown
there
was
a
blemish
in
his
idol
since
at
all
costs
she
must
glitter
wogan
however
was
the
master
here
her
highness
must
lose
her
jewels
he
said
roughly
and
was
turning
away
when
her
highness
herself
spoke
you
are
unjust
my
friend
she
said
i
would
lose
them
very
willingly
were
there
a
chance
no
one
else
would
discover
them
but
there
no
chance
the
woman
of
the
tavern
will
find
the
bundle
will
open
it
very
likely
she
has
done
so
already
we
shall
have
all
innspruck
on
our
heels
in
half
an
hour
and
for
the
first
time
that
night
wogan
heard
her
voice
break
and
grieved
to
know
that
the
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
he
called
to
ride
back
to
the
tavern
bring
the
packet
without
fail
galloped
off
and
gaydon
drove
the
carriage
to
the
side
of
the
road
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
and
they
waited
in
silence
counting
up
the
chances
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
landlady
if
once
she
discovered
the
jewels
hidden
away
in
a
common
packet
of
clothing
must
suspect
the
travellers
who
had
left
them
behind
she
would
be
terrified
by
their
value
she
would
be
afraid
to
retain
them
lest
harm
should
come
to
her
and
all
innspruck
would
be
upon
the
fugitives
heels
they
waited
for
half
an
hour
thirty
minutes
of
gloom
and
despair
clementina
wept
over
this
new
danger
which
her
comrades
ran
misset
wept
for
that
her
negligence
was
to
blame
gaydon
sat
on
the
box
in
the
falling
snow
with
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
and
felt
his
head
already
loose
upon
his
shoulders
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
had
any
comfort
of
that
was
wogan
for
he
had
been
wrong
the
chosen
woman
had
no
wish
to
glitter
at
all
costs
though
to
be
sure
she
could
not
help
glittering
with
the
refulgence
of
her
great
merits
his
idol
had
no
blemish
wogan
paced
up
and
down
the
road
while
he
listened
for
return
and
that
thought
cheated
the
time
for
him
at
last
he
heard
very
faintly
the
sound
of
galloping
hoofs
below
him
on
the
road
he
ran
back
to
gaydon
it
might
be
a
courier
to
arrest
us
if
i
shout
drive
fast
as
you
can
to
nazareth
and
from
nazareth
to
italy
he
hurried
down
the
road
and
was
hailed
by
i
have
it
said
he
wogan
turned
and
ran
by
stirrup
to
the
carriage
the
landlady
has
a
good
conscience
and
sleeps
well
said
i
found
the
house
dark
and
the
doors
shut
they
were
only
secured
however
by
a
wooden
beam
dropped
into
a
couple
of
sockets
on
the
inside
but
how
did
you
open
them
asked
clementina
your
highness
i
have
after
all
a
pair
of
arms
said
i
just
pressed
on
the
doors
till
till
the
sockets
gave
no
till
the
beam
broke
said
he
and
clementina
laughed
that
my
six
foot
four
said
she
did
not
understand
but
he
smiled
with
great
condescension
and
dignity
and
continued
his
story
i
groped
my
way
up
the
stairs
into
the
room
and
found
the
bundle
untouched
in
the
corner
he
handed
it
to
the
princess
wogan
sprang
again
onto
the
box
and
gaydon
whipped
up
the
horses
they
reached
the
first
posting
stage
at
two
the
second
at
four
the
third
at
six
and
at
each
they
wasted
no
time
all
that
night
their
horses
strained
up
the
mountain
road
amid
the
whirling
sleet
at
times
the
wind
roaring
down
a
gorge
would
set
the
carriage
rocking
at
times
they
stuck
fast
in
drifts
and
wogan
and
gaydon
must
leap
from
the
box
and
plunging
in
the
snow
must
drag
at
the
horses
and
push
at
the
wheels
the
pace
was
too
slow
wogan
seemed
to
hear
on
every
gust
of
wind
the
sound
of
a
galloping
company
we
have
lost
twelve
hours
more
than
twelve
hours
now
he
repeated
and
repeated
to
gaydon
all
the
way
to
ala
they
would
still
be
in
the
emperor
territory
it
needed
only
a
single
courier
to
gallop
past
them
and
at
either
roveredo
or
trent
they
would
infallibly
be
taken
wogan
fingered
his
pistols
straining
his
eyes
backwards
down
the
road
at
daybreak
the
snow
stopped
the
carriage
rolled
on
high
among
the
mountains
under
a
grey
sky
and
here
and
there
at
a
wind
of
the
road
wogan
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
towers
and
of
innspruck
or
had
within
his
view
a
stretch
of
the
slope
they
had
climbed
but
there
was
never
a
black
speck
visible
upon
the
white
of
the
snow
as
yet
no
courier
was
overtaking
them
as
yet
innspruck
did
not
know
its
captive
had
escaped
at
eight
in
the
morning
they
came
to
nazareth
and
found
their
own
berlin
ready
harnessed
at
the
door
the
postillion
already
in
his
saddle
and
misset
waiting
with
an
uncovered
head
her
highness
will
breakfast
here
no
doubt
said
gaydon
misset
will
have
seen
to
it
cried
wogan
that
the
berlin
is
furnished
we
can
breakfast
as
we
go
they
waited
no
more
than
ten
minutes
at
nazareth
the
order
of
travelling
was
now
changed
wogan
and
gaydon
now
travelled
in
the
berlin
with
misset
and
clementina
gaydon
being
the
oldest
of
the
party
figured
as
the
count
of
cernes
misset
as
his
wife
clementina
as
his
niece
and
wogan
as
a
friend
of
the
family
and
misset
rode
beside
the
carriage
in
the
guise
of
servants
thus
they
started
from
nazareth
and
had
journeyed
perhaps
a
mile
when
without
so
much
as
a
moan
clementina
swooned
and
fell
forward
into
wogan
arms
misset
uttered
a
cry
wogan
clasped
the
princess
to
his
breast
her
head
fell
back
across
his
arm
pale
as
death
her
eyes
were
closed
her
bosom
strained
against
his
neither
rose
nor
fell
she
has
fasted
all
lent
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
she
has
eaten
nothing
since
we
left
innspruck
misset
burst
into
tears
she
caught
clementina
hand
and
clasped
it
she
had
no
eyes
but
for
her
with
gaydon
it
was
different
wogan
was
holding
the
princess
in
a
clasp
too
loverlike
though
to
be
sure
it
was
none
of
his
business
we
must
stop
the
carriage
he
said
no
cried
wogan
desperately
that
we
must
not
do
and
he
caught
her
still
closer
to
him
he
had
a
fear
that
she
was
dying
even
so
she
should
not
be
recaptured
though
she
were
dead
he
would
still
carry
her
dead
body
into
bologna
and
lay
it
white
and
still
before
his
king
europe
from
london
to
the
bosphorus
should
know
the
truth
of
her
and
ring
with
the
wonder
of
her
though
she
were
dead
attracted
by
the
noise
of
misset
lamentations
bent
down
over
his
horse
neck
and
looked
into
the
carriage
her
highness
is
dead
he
cried
drive
on
replied
wogan
through
his
clenched
teeth
upon
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
misset
shouted
through
the
window
there
is
a
spring
by
the
roadside
drive
on
said
wogan
gaydon
touched
him
on
the
arm
you
will
stifle
her
man
wogan
woke
to
a
comprehension
of
his
attitude
and
placed
clementina
back
on
her
seat
misset
by
good
fortune
had
a
small
bottle
of
carmelite
water
in
her
pocket
she
held
it
to
the
princess
nostrils
who
in
a
little
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
her
companions
in
tears
about
her
imploring
her
to
wake
it
is
nothing
she
said
take
courage
my
poor
marmosets
and
with
a
smile
she
added
there
my
six
feet
four
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
did
ever
a
woman
have
such
friends
the
sun
came
out
in
the
sky
as
she
spoke
they
had
topped
the
pass
and
were
now
driving
down
towards
italy
there
was
snow
about
them
still
on
the
and
deep
in
drifts
upon
the
roads
the
air
was
musical
with
the
sound
of
innumerable
freshets
they
could
be
seen
leaping
and
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
the
valleys
below
were
green
with
the
young
green
of
spring
and
the
winds
were
tempered
with
the
warmth
of
italy
a
like
change
came
upon
the
fugitives
they
laughed
where
before
they
had
wept
from
under
the
seat
they
pulled
out
chickens
which
misset
had
cooked
with
his
own
hands
at
nazareth
bottles
of
the
wine
of
laurent
and
bread
and
wogan
allowed
a
halt
long
enough
to
get
water
from
a
spring
by
the
roadside
there
is
no
salt
said
gaydon
indeed
there
is
replied
misset
indignant
at
the
aspersion
on
his
catering
i
have
it
in
my
he
took
his
from
his
pocket
and
passed
it
into
the
carriage
clementina
made
sandwiches
and
passed
them
out
to
the
horsemen
the
chickens
turned
out
to
be
old
cocks
impervious
to
the
soundest
tooth
no
one
minded
except
misset
who
had
brought
them
the
jolts
of
the
carriage
became
matter
for
a
jest
they
picnicked
with
the
merriment
of
children
and
finally
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
emperor
fired
off
both
his
loaded
pistols
in
the
air
at
that
wogan
anxiety
returned
he
blazed
up
into
anger
he
thrust
his
head
from
the
window
is
this
your
respect
for
her
highness
he
cried
is
this
your
consideration
nay
interposed
clementina
you
shall
not
chide
my
six
feet
four
but
he
is
mad
your
highness
i
do
say
but
what
a
trifle
of
madness
is
salt
to
a
man
but
clean
daft
to
be
firing
his
pistols
off
to
let
the
whole
world
know
who
we
are
here
are
we
not
six
stages
from
innspruck
and
already
we
have
lost
twelve
hours
when
last
night
before
we
left
innspruck
between
the
time
when
you
escaped
from
the
villa
and
when
i
joined
you
in
the
avenue
i
climbed
out
of
the
window
to
descend
as
i
had
entered
but
the
sentinel
had
returned
i
waited
on
the
crouched
against
the
wall
until
he
should
show
me
his
back
after
five
minutes
or
so
he
did
he
stamped
on
the
snow
and
marched
up
the
lane
i
let
myself
down
and
hung
by
my
hands
but
he
turned
on
his
beat
before
i
could
drop
he
marched
back
i
clung
to
the
ledge
thinking
that
in
the
darkness
he
would
pass
on
beneath
me
and
never
notice
he
did
not
notice
but
my
fingers
were
frozen
and
numbed
with
the
cold
i
felt
them
slipping
i
could
cling
no
longer
and
i
fell
luckily
i
fell
just
as
he
passed
beneath
me
i
dropped
feet
foremost
upon
his
shoulders
and
he
went
down
without
a
cry
i
left
him
lying
stunned
there
on
the
snow
but
he
will
be
found
or
he
will
recover
either
way
our
escape
will
be
discovered
and
no
later
than
this
morning
nay
it
must
already
have
been
discovered
already
innspruck
bells
are
ringing
the
alarm
already
the
pursuit
is
begun
and
he
leaned
his
head
from
the
window
and
cried
faster
faster
for
his
part
shouted
trinkgeldt
it
was
the
only
word
of
german
which
he
knew
but
said
he
there
was
a
saracen
lady
i
learned
about
at
school
who
travelled
over
europe
and
found
her
lover
in
an
alehouse
in
london
with
no
word
but
his
name
to
help
her
over
the
road
sure
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
if
i
could
travel
all
over
germany
with
the
help
of
the
word
certainly
had
its
efficacy
with
the
postillion
trinkgeldt
cried
and
the
berlin
rocked
and
lurched
and
leaped
down
the
pass
the
snow
was
now
less
deep
the
drifts
fewer
the
road
wound
along
a
at
one
window
rose
the
rock
from
the
other
the
travellers
looked
down
hundreds
of
feet
to
the
bed
of
the
valley
and
the
boiling
torrent
of
the
adige
it
was
a
mere
narrow
ribbon
of
a
road
made
by
the
romans
without
a
thought
for
the
convenience
of
travellers
in
a
later
day
and
as
the
carriage
turned
a
corner
mounted
on
his
horse
saw
ahead
a
heavy
cart
crawling
up
towards
them
the
carter
saw
the
berlin
thundering
down
towards
him
behind
its
four
maddened
horses
and
he
drew
his
cart
to
the
inside
of
the
road
against
the
rock
the
postillion
tugged
at
his
reins
he
had
not
sufficient
interval
of
space
to
check
his
team
he
threw
a
despairing
glance
at
it
seemed
impossible
the
berlin
could
pass
there
was
no
use
to
cry
out
fell
behind
the
carriage
with
his
mind
made
up
he
looked
down
the
precipice
he
saw
in
his
imagination
the
huge
carriage
with
its
tangled
struggling
horses
falling
sheer
into
the
foam
of
the
river
he
could
not
ride
back
to
bologna
with
that
story
to
tell
he
and
his
horse
must
take
the
same
quick
steep
road
the
postillion
drove
so
close
to
the
cart
that
he
touched
it
as
he
passed
we
are
lost
he
shouted
in
an
agony
and
saw
the
hind
wheel
of
the
berlin
slip
off
the
road
and
revolve
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
the
air
he
was
already
putting
his
horse
at
the
precipice
as
though
it
was
a
ditch
to
be
jumped
when
the
berlin
made
to
his
astonished
eyes
an
effort
to
recover
its
balance
like
a
live
thing
it
seemed
to
spring
sideways
from
the
brink
of
the
precipice
it
not
only
seemed
it
did
spring
and
drawing
rein
in
the
great
revulsion
of
his
feelings
saw
as
he
rocked
unsteadily
in
his
saddle
the
carriage
tearing
safe
and
unhurt
down
the
very
centre
of
the
road
set
his
spurs
to
his
horse
and
galloped
after
it
the
postillion
looked
back
and
laughed
trinkgeldt
he
cried
swore
loudly
and
getting
level
beat
him
with
his
whip
head
popped
out
of
the
window
silence
said
he
in
a
rage
mademoiselle
is
asleep
and
then
seeing
white
and
disordered
face
he
asked
what
is
it
no
one
in
the
coach
had
had
a
suspicion
of
their
danger
but
still
saw
before
his
eyes
that
wheel
slip
over
the
precipice
and
revolve
in
air
he
still
felt
his
horse
beneath
him
quiver
and
refuse
this
leap
into
air
in
broken
tones
he
gasped
out
his
story
to
wogan
and
as
he
spoke
the
princess
stirred
hush
said
wogan
she
need
not
know
ride
behind
your
blue
eyes
are
green
with
terror
your
face
will
tell
the
story
if
once
she
sees
it
fell
back
again
behind
the
carriage
and
at
four
that
afternoon
they
stopped
before
the
at
brixen
they
had
crossed
the
brenner
in
a
storm
of
snow
and
howling
winds
they
had
travelled
ten
leagues
from
innspruck
wogan
called
a
halt
of
half
an
hour
the
princess
had
eaten
barely
a
mouthful
since
her
supper
of
the
night
before
wogan
forced
her
to
alight
forced
her
to
eat
a
couple
of
eggs
and
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
before
the
had
passed
she
was
anxious
to
start
again
from
brixen
the
road
was
easier
and
either
from
the
smoothness
of
the
travelling
or
through
some
partial
relief
from
his
anxieties
wogan
who
had
kept
awake
so
long
suddenly
fell
fast
asleep
and
when
he
woke
up
again
the
night
was
come
he
woke
up
without
a
start
or
even
a
movement
as
was
his
habit
and
sat
silently
and
bitterly
reproaching
himself
for
that
he
had
yielded
to
fatigue
it
was
within
the
carriage
he
stared
through
the
window
and
saw
dimly
the
moving
and
here
and
there
a
clump
of
trees
rush
past
the
steady
breathing
of
gaydon
on
his
left
and
of
misset
in
the
corner
opposite
to
gaydon
showed
that
those
two
guardians
slept
as
well
his
reproaches
became
more
bitter
and
then
suddenly
ceased
for
over
against
him
in
the
darkness
a
young
fresh
voice
was
singing
very
sweetly
and
very
low
it
was
the
princess
clementina
and
she
sang
to
herself
thinking
all
three
of
her
companions
were
asleep
wogan
had
not
caught
the
sound
at
first
above
the
clatter
of
the
wheels
and
even
now
that
he
listened
it
came
intermittently
to
his
ears
he
heard
enough
however
to
know
and
to
rejoice
that
there
was
no
melancholy
in
the
music
the
song
had
the
clear
bright
thrill
of
the
blackbird
note
in
june
wogan
listened
entranced
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
written
the
song
with
which
clementina
solaced
herself
in
the
darkness
to
have
composed
the
melody
on
which
her
voice
rose
and
sank
the
carriage
drew
up
at
an
inn
the
horses
were
changed
the
flight
was
resumed
wogan
had
not
moved
during
this
delay
neither
had
misset
nor
come
to
the
door
but
an
ostler
had
flashed
a
lantern
into
the
berlin
and
for
a
second
the
light
had
fallen
upon
wogan
face
and
open
eyes
clementina
however
did
not
cease
she
sang
on
until
the
lights
had
been
left
behind
and
the
darkness
was
about
them
then
she
stopped
and
said
how
long
is
it
since
you
woke
wogan
was
taken
by
surprise
i
should
never
have
slept
at
all
stammered
he
i
promised
myself
that
not
a
wink
of
sleep
betwixt
innspruck
and
italy
and
here
was
i
fast
as
a
log
this
side
of
trent
i
think
our
postillion
sleeps
too
and
letting
down
the
window
he
quietly
called
misset
we
have
fresh
relays
said
he
and
we
travel
at
a
the
relays
are
only
fresh
to
us
returned
misset
we
can
go
no
faster
there
is
someone
ahead
with
three
stages
start
of
us
someone
of
importance
it
would
seem
and
who
travels
with
a
retinue
for
he
takes
all
the
horses
at
each
stage
wogan
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
the
horses
lagged
in
this
hurried
flight
the
most
trifling
hindrance
was
a
monumental
danger
and
this
was
no
trifling
hindrance
for
the
hue
and
cry
was
most
certainly
raised
behind
them
the
pursuit
from
innspruck
had
begun
twelve
hours
since
on
the
most
favourable
reckoning
at
any
moment
they
might
hear
the
jingle
of
a
horse
harness
on
the
road
behind
and
now
here
was
a
man
with
a
great
retinue
blocking
their
way
in
front
we
can
do
no
more
but
make
a
fight
of
it
in
the
end
said
he
they
may
be
few
who
follow
us
but
who
is
he
ahead
misset
did
not
know
i
can
tell
you
said
clementina
with
a
slight
hesitation
it
is
the
prince
of
baden
and
he
travels
to
italy
wogan
remembered
a
certain
letter
which
his
king
had
written
to
him
from
rome
and
the
hesitation
in
the
girl
voice
told
him
the
rest
of
the
story
wogan
would
have
given
much
to
have
had
his
fingers
about
the
scruff
of
that
pompous
gentleman
neck
with
the
precipice
handy
at
his
feet
it
was
intolerable
that
the
fellow
should
pester
the
princess
in
prison
and
hinder
her
flight
when
she
had
escaped
from
it
well
we
can
do
no
more
said
he
and
he
drew
up
the
window
neither
gaydon
nor
misset
were
awakened
clementina
and
wogan
were
alone
in
the
darkness
she
leaned
forward
to
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
tell
me
of
the
king
i
shall
make
mistakes
in
this
new
world
will
he
have
patience
with
me
while
i
learn
she
had
spoken
upon
the
same
strain
in
the
darkness
of
the
staircase
only
the
night
before
wogan
gently
laughed
her
fears
aside
i
will
tell
you
the
truest
thing
about
the
king
he
needs
you
at
his
side
for
all
his
friends
he
is
at
heart
a
lonely
man
throned
upon
sorrows
i
dare
to
tell
you
that
knowing
you
he
needs
not
a
mere
wife
but
a
mate
a
helpmate
to
strive
with
him
her
hand
in
his
every
man
needs
the
helpmate
as
i
read
the
world
for
it
can
not
but
be
that
a
man
falls
below
himself
when
he
comes
home
always
to
an
empty
room
the
princess
was
silent
wogan
hoped
that
he
had
reassured
her
but
her
thoughts
were
now
turned
from
herself
she
leaned
yet
further
forward
with
her
elbows
upon
her
knees
and
in
a
yet
lower
voice
she
asked
a
question
which
fairly
startled
him
does
she
not
love
you
wogan
indeed
had
spoken
unconsciously
with
a
deep
note
of
sadness
in
his
voice
which
had
sounded
all
the
more
strange
and
sad
to
her
from
its
contrast
with
the
quick
cheerful
vigorous
tones
she
had
come
to
think
the
mark
of
him
he
had
spoken
as
though
he
looked
forward
with
a
poignant
regret
through
a
weary
span
of
days
and
saw
himself
always
in
youth
and
middle
years
and
age
coming
home
always
to
an
empty
room
therefore
she
put
her
question
and
wogan
was
taken
off
his
guard
there
is
no
one
he
said
in
a
flurry
clementina
shook
her
head
i
wish
that
i
may
hear
the
king
speak
so
and
in
that
voice
i
shall
be
very
sure
he
loves
me
she
said
in
a
musing
voice
and
so
changing
almost
to
a
note
of
raillery
tell
me
her
name
she
pleaded
what
is
amiss
with
her
that
she
is
not
thankful
for
a
true
man
love
like
yours
is
she
haughty
i
bring
her
on
her
knees
to
you
does
she
think
her
birth
sets
her
too
high
in
the
world
i
show
her
so
much
contempt
you
so
much
courtesy
that
she
shall
fall
from
her
arrogance
and
dote
upon
your
steps
perhaps
she
is
too
sure
of
your
devotion
why
then
i
make
her
jealous
wogan
interrupted
her
and
the
agitation
of
his
voice
put
an
end
to
her
raillery
somehow
she
had
wounded
him
who
had
done
so
much
for
her
madam
i
beg
you
to
believe
me
there
is
no
one
and
casting
about
for
a
sure
argument
to
dispel
her
conjectures
he
said
on
an
impulse
listen
i
will
make
your
highness
a
confidence
he
stopped
to
make
sure
that
gaydon
and
misset
were
still
asleep
then
he
laughed
uneasily
like
a
man
that
is
and
resumed
i
am
lord
and
king
of
a
city
of
dreams
here
the
opening
of
a
fairy
tale
you
will
say
but
when
i
am
asleep
my
city
very
real
and
even
now
that
i
am
awake
i
could
draw
you
a
map
of
it
though
i
could
not
name
its
streets
that
my
town
one
blemish
its
streets
are
nameless
it
has
taken
a
long
while
in
the
building
ever
since
my
boyhood
and
indeed
the
not
finished
yet
nor
do
i
think
it
ever
will
be
finished
till
i
die
since
my
brain
its
architect
when
i
was
asleep
but
now
i
discovered
a
new
villa
and
an
avenue
of
trees
and
a
tavern
with
red
blinds
which
i
had
never
remarked
before
at
the
first
there
was
nothing
but
a
queer
white
house
of
which
the
original
has
fallen
to
ruins
at
rathcoffey
in
ireland
this
house
stood
alone
in
a
wide
flat
emerald
plain
that
stretched
like
an
untravelled
sea
to
a
circle
of
curving
sky
there
was
room
to
build
you
see
and
when
i
left
rathcoffey
and
became
a
wanderer
the
building
went
on
apace
there
are
dark
lanes
there
from
avignon
between
great
frowning
houses
narrow
climbing
streets
from
meran
arcades
from
verona
and
a
park
of
many
thickets
and
tall
with
a
long
silver
stretch
of
water
one
day
you
will
see
that
park
from
the
windows
of
james
it
has
a
wall
too
my
city
a
round
wall
enclosing
it
within
a
perfect
circle
and
from
whatever
quarter
of
the
plain
you
come
towards
it
you
only
see
this
wall
there
not
so
much
as
a
chimney
visible
above
it
once
you
have
crowded
with
the
caravans
and
traders
through
the
gates
for
my
town
is
busy
you
are
at
once
in
the
ringing
streets
i
think
my
architect
in
that
took
aigues
mortes
for
his
model
outside
you
have
the
flat
silent
plain
across
which
the
merchants
creep
in
long
trailing
lines
within
the
noise
of
markets
the
tramp
of
horses
hoofs
the
talk
of
men
and
women
and
if
you
listen
hard
the
whispers
too
of
lovers
oh
my
city
populous
there
are
quiet
alleys
with
windows
opening
onto
them
where
on
summer
nights
you
may
see
a
young
girl
face
with
the
moonlight
on
it
like
a
glory
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
beneath
the
cloaked
figure
of
a
youth
well
i
have
a
notion
and
then
he
broke
off
abruptly
there
a
black
horse
i
own
my
favourite
horse
you
rode
it
the
first
time
you
came
to
ohlau
said
the
princess
do
you
indeed
remember
that
cried
wogan
with
so
much
pleasure
that
gaydon
stirred
in
his
corner
and
clementina
said
hush
wogan
waited
in
a
suspense
lest
gaydon
should
wake
up
which
to
be
sure
would
be
the
most
inconsiderate
thing
in
the
world
gaydon
however
settled
himself
more
comfortably
and
in
a
little
his
regular
breathing
might
be
heard
again
well
resumed
wogan
i
have
a
notion
that
the
lady
i
shall
marry
will
come
riding
some
sunrise
on
my
black
horse
across
the
plain
and
into
my
city
of
dreams
and
she
has
not
ah
said
clementina
here
a
subterfuge
my
friend
the
lady
you
shall
marry
you
say
but
tell
me
this
has
the
lady
you
love
ridden
on
your
black
horse
into
your
city
of
dreams
no
said
wogan
for
there
is
no
lady
whom
i
love
there
wogan
should
have
ended
but
he
added
rather
sadly
nor
is
there
like
to
be
then
i
am
sure
said
clementina
sure
that
i
speak
truth
no
sure
that
you
mislead
me
it
is
not
kind
for
here
perhaps
i
might
give
you
some
small
token
of
my
gratitude
would
you
but
let
me
oh
it
is
no
matter
i
shall
find
out
who
the
lady
is
you
need
not
doubt
it
i
shall
set
my
wits
and
eyes
to
work
there
shall
be
marriages
when
i
am
queen
i
will
find
out
wogan
face
was
not
visible
in
the
darkness
but
he
spoke
quickly
and
in
a
startled
voice
that
you
must
never
do
promise
that
you
never
will
promise
me
that
you
will
never
try
and
again
gaydon
stirred
in
his
corner
clementina
made
no
answer
to
the
passionate
words
she
did
not
promise
but
she
drew
a
breath
and
then
from
head
to
foot
she
shivered
wogan
dared
not
repeat
his
plea
for
a
promise
but
he
felt
that
though
she
had
not
given
it
none
the
less
she
would
keep
it
they
sat
for
awhile
silent
then
clementina
came
back
to
her
first
question
tell
me
of
the
king
she
said
very
softly
and
as
the
carriage
rolled
down
the
mountain
valley
through
the
night
and
its
wheels
struck
flashes
of
fire
from
the
stones
wogan
drew
a
picture
for
her
of
the
man
she
was
to
marry
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
escape
from
the
dangerous
talk
of
the
last
hour
and
he
spoke
fervently
the
poet
in
him
had
always
been
sensitive
to
the
glamour
of
that
wandering
prince
he
had
his
countrymen
instinctive
devotion
for
a
failing
cause
this
was
no
suitable
moment
for
dwelling
upon
the
defects
and
weaknesses
wogan
told
her
the
story
of
the
campaign
in
scotland
of
the
year
residence
in
avignon
he
spoke
most
burningly
a
girl
would
no
doubt
like
to
hear
of
her
love
achievements
and
if
james
stuart
had
not
so
many
to
his
name
as
a
man
could
wish
that
was
merely
because
chance
had
served
him
ill
so
a
fair
tale
was
told
not
to
be
found
in
any
history
book
of
a
night
attack
in
scotland
and
how
the
chevalier
de
george
surprised
and
already
to
all
purposes
a
prisoner
forced
a
way
alone
through
nine
grenadiers
with
loaded
muskets
and
escaped
over
the
it
was
a
good
breathless
story
as
he
told
it
and
he
had
just
come
to
an
end
of
it
when
the
carriage
drove
through
the
village
of
wellishmile
and
stopped
at
the
wogan
opened
the
door
and
shook
gaydon
by
the
shoulder
let
us
try
if
we
can
get
stronger
horses
here
said
he
and
he
got
out
gaydon
woke
up
with
surprising
alacrity
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
said
he
i
beseech
your
forgiveness
i
have
slept
this
long
while
it
was
no
business
of
his
if
wogan
chose
to
attribute
his
own
escape
from
newgate
as
an
exploit
of
the
king
the
story
was
a
familiar
one
at
bologna
whither
they
were
hurrying
it
was
sufficiently
known
that
charles
wogan
was
its
hero
all
this
was
wogan
business
not
gaydon
nor
had
gaydon
anything
to
do
with
any
city
of
dreams
or
with
any
lady
that
might
ride
into
it
or
with
any
black
horse
that
chanced
to
carry
her
poets
no
doubt
talked
that
way
it
was
their
business
gaydon
was
not
sorry
that
he
had
slept
so
heartily
through
those
last
stages
he
got
down
from
the
carriage
and
met
wogan
coming
from
the
inn
with
a
face
of
dismay
we
are
stopped
here
there
is
no
help
for
it
we
have
gained
on
the
prince
of
baden
who
is
no
more
than
two
stages
ahead
the
relays
which
carried
him
from
here
to
the
next
stage
have
only
this
instant
come
back
they
are
too
tired
to
move
so
we
must
stay
until
they
are
refreshed
and
we
are
still
three
posts
this
side
of
trent
he
cried
i
would
not
mind
were
trent
behind
us
but
there
no
help
for
it
i
have
hired
a
room
where
the
countess
and
her
niece
can
sleep
until
such
time
as
we
can
start
clementina
and
misset
descended
and
supped
in
company
with
gaydon
and
wogan
while
misset
and
waited
upon
them
as
servants
it
was
a
silent
sort
of
supper
very
different
from
the
meal
they
had
made
that
morning
for
though
the
fare
was
better
it
lacked
the
exhilaration
this
delay
weighed
heavily
upon
them
all
for
the
country
was
now
for
a
sure
thing
raised
behind
them
and
if
they
had
gained
on
the
prince
of
baden
their
pursuers
had
no
less
certainly
gained
on
them
would
we
were
side
of
trent
exclaimed
wogan
and
looking
up
he
saw
that
clementina
was
watching
him
with
a
strange
intentness
her
eyes
were
on
him
again
while
they
sat
at
supper
and
when
he
led
her
to
the
door
of
her
room
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
she
stood
for
a
little
while
looking
deep
into
his
eyes
and
though
she
had
much
need
of
sleep
when
she
had
got
into
the
room
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
her
she
remained
staring
at
the
logs
of
the
fire
for
she
knew
his
secret
and
to
her
eyes
he
was
now
another
man
before
wogan
was
the
untiring
servant
the
unflinching
friend
now
he
was
the
man
who
loved
her
the
risks
he
had
run
his
journeyings
his
unswerving
confidence
in
the
result
his
laborious
days
and
nights
of
preparation
and
the
swift
execution
love
as
well
as
service
claimed
a
share
in
these
he
was
changed
for
ever
to
her
eyes
she
knew
his
secret
there
was
the
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
for
she
must
needs
think
over
all
that
he
had
said
and
done
by
the
new
light
the
secret
shed
when
did
he
first
begin
to
care
why
she
recalled
his
first
visit
long
ago
to
ohlau
when
he
rode
across
the
park
on
his
black
horse
charged
with
his
momentous
errand
she
had
been
standing
she
remembered
before
the
blazing
in
the
great
stone
hall
much
as
she
was
standing
now
great
changes
had
come
since
then
she
was
james
stuart
chosen
wife
and
this
man
loved
her
he
had
no
hope
of
any
reward
he
desired
even
that
she
should
not
know
she
should
no
doubt
have
been
properly
sorry
and
compassionate
but
she
was
a
girl
simple
and
frank
to
be
loved
by
a
man
who
could
so
endure
and
strive
and
ask
no
guerdon
that
lifted
her
she
thought
the
more
worthily
of
herself
because
he
loved
her
she
was
raised
thereby
she
could
not
be
sorry
her
blood
pulsed
her
heart
sang
the
starry
eyes
shone
with
a
brighter
light
he
loved
her
she
knew
his
secret
a
little
clock
chimed
the
hour
upon
the
and
lifting
her
eyes
she
saw
that
just
hours
had
passed
since
she
had
driven
out
of
innspruck
up
the
brenner
as
she
got
into
bed
a
horse
galloped
up
to
the
inn
and
stopped
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
ridden
on
his
black
horse
out
of
the
sunrise
across
the
plain
he
loved
her
and
since
he
loved
her
surely
she
fell
asleep
puzzled
and
wondering
why
she
was
waked
up
some
two
hours
afterwards
by
a
rapping
on
the
door
and
she
grew
hot
and
she
recognised
wogan
voice
cautiously
whispering
to
her
to
rise
with
all
speed
for
in
her
dreams
from
which
she
had
wakened
she
had
ridden
across
the
flat
green
plain
into
the
round
city
of
dreams
chapter
xvi
when
the
horse
galloped
up
to
the
door
the
princess
turned
on
her
side
and
went
to
sleep
in
the
below
gaydon
and
wogan
were
smoking
a
pipe
of
tobacco
over
the
fire
both
men
rose
on
the
instant
wogan
stealthily
opened
the
door
an
inch
or
so
and
looked
down
the
passage
gaydon
raised
a
corner
of
the
blind
and
peered
through
the
window
the
two
remaining
members
of
the
party
misset
and
who
as
lackeys
had
served
the
supper
of
the
princess
were
now
eating
their
own
when
the
princess
turned
over
on
her
side
and
wogan
stepped
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
and
gaydon
peeped
through
the
window
misset
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
drawing
a
flask
from
his
pocket
emptied
its
contents
into
an
earthenware
which
stood
upon
the
table
for
his
part
simply
continued
to
eat
he
is
getting
off
his
horse
said
gaydon
has
he
ridden
hard
do
you
think
asked
misset
he
looks
in
a
mighty
looked
up
from
his
plate
and
became
gradually
aware
that
something
was
occurring
before
he
could
speak
however
gaydon
dropped
the
blind
he
is
coming
in
it
will
never
do
for
him
to
find
the
four
of
us
together
he
may
not
be
the
courier
from
innspruck
on
the
other
hand
he
may
and
seeing
the
four
of
us
he
will
ask
questions
of
the
landlord
seeing
no
more
than
two
he
will
very
likely
ask
none
began
to
understand
he
understood
at
all
events
that
for
him
there
was
to
be
no
more
supper
if
two
were
to
make
themselves
scarce
he
knew
that
he
would
be
one
of
the
two
very
well
said
he
heaving
a
sigh
which
made
the
glasses
on
the
table
dance
and
laying
his
napkin
down
he
got
up
to
his
surprise
however
he
was
bidden
to
stay
gaydon
and
i
will
go
said
wogan
jack
will
find
out
the
business
misset
nodded
his
head
took
up
his
knife
and
fork
again
he
leaned
across
the
table
to
as
the
others
stepped
out
of
the
room
you
speak
only
french
lucius
you
come
from
savoy
he
had
no
time
to
say
more
for
the
stamped
blustering
down
the
passage
and
flung
into
the
room
the
man
as
gaydon
had
remarked
was
in
a
mighty
his
clothes
and
his
face
were
splashed
with
mud
and
he
seemed
moreover
in
the
last
stage
of
exhaustion
for
though
he
bawled
for
the
landlord
it
was
in
a
weak
hoarse
voice
which
did
not
reach
beyond
the
door
misset
looked
at
him
with
sympathy
you
have
no
doubt
come
far
said
he
and
the
landlord
a
laggard
here
something
that
may
comfort
you
till
he
comes
and
he
filled
a
glass
half
full
with
red
tyrol
wine
from
the
bottle
at
his
elbow
the
man
thanked
him
and
advanced
to
the
table
it
is
a
raw
hot
wine
continued
misset
and
goes
better
with
water
and
he
filled
up
the
glass
from
the
the
courier
reached
out
his
hand
for
it
i
am
the
thirstiest
man
in
all
germany
said
he
and
he
took
a
gulp
of
the
wine
and
immediately
fell
to
spluttering
save
us
said
he
but
this
wine
is
devilishly
strong
try
some
more
water
said
misset
and
again
he
filled
up
the
glass
the
courier
drank
it
all
in
a
single
draught
and
stood
winking
his
eyes
and
shaking
his
head
that
warms
a
man
said
he
it
does
one
good
and
again
he
called
for
the
landlord
and
this
time
in
a
strange
voice
the
landlord
still
lagged
however
and
misset
did
not
doubt
that
wogan
had
found
a
means
to
detain
him
he
filled
up
the
courier
glass
again
half
wine
half
water
the
courier
sat
heavily
down
in
a
chair
i
take
the
liberty
gentlemen
said
he
i
am
no
better
than
a
to
sit
beside
gentlemen
but
indeed
i
can
stand
no
longer
never
have
i
stridden
across
such
vile
cattle
as
they
keep
for
travellers
on
the
brenner
road
i
have
sprained
my
legs
with
spurring
seven
times
he
cried
with
an
oath
seven
times
has
a
horse
dropped
under
me
there
not
an
inch
of
me
unbruised
curse
me
if
there
is
i
a
cake
of
mud
misset
knew
very
well
why
the
courier
had
suffered
these
falls
the
horses
he
had
ridden
had
first
been
tired
by
the
prince
of
baden
and
then
had
the
last
spark
of
fire
flogged
out
of
them
by
the
postillions
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
however
and
said
that
looks
ill
for
us
the
courier
gazed
suddenly
at
misset
then
at
with
a
dull
sort
of
suspicion
in
his
eyes
and
which
way
might
you
gentlemen
be
travelling
to
innspruck
we
from
trent
said
misset
boldly
the
courier
turned
to
and
you
too
sir
turned
a
stolid
uncomprehending
face
upon
the
courier
pour
moi
monsieur
je
suis
savoyard
monsieur
qui
vous
parle
mon
compagnon
de
négoce
the
courier
gazed
with
blank
heavy
eyes
at
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
fuddled
with
drink
he
heaved
a
sigh
or
two
will
you
repeat
that
he
said
at
length
and
slowly
repeated
his
remark
and
the
courier
nodded
at
him
very
strange
said
he
solemnly
wagging
his
head
i
do
not
dispute
its
truth
but
it
is
most
strange
i
will
tell
my
wife
of
it
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
a
twinge
from
his
bruises
made
him
cry
out
i
shall
be
as
stiff
as
a
mummy
in
the
morning
he
exclaimed
and
swore
loudly
at
the
bandits
who
had
caused
him
this
deplorable
journey
misset
and
exchanged
a
quick
glance
and
misset
pushed
the
glass
across
the
table
the
courier
took
it
and
his
eyes
lighted
up
you
have
come
from
trent
said
he
did
you
pass
a
travelling
carriage
on
the
road
yes
said
misset
the
prince
of
baden
with
a
large
following
drove
into
trent
as
we
came
out
yes
yes
said
the
courier
but
no
second
party
behind
the
prince
misset
shook
his
head
he
made
a
pretence
of
consulting
in
french
and
shook
his
head
then
i
shall
have
the
robbers
cried
the
courier
they
are
to
be
flayed
alive
and
they
deserve
it
he
shouted
fiercely
to
misset
he
dropped
his
head
upon
his
arms
and
muttered
again
it
seemed
that
he
was
falling
asleep
but
he
suddenly
sat
up
and
beat
on
the
table
with
his
fist
i
have
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
ah
flayed
alive
and
hanged
no
hanged
and
flayed
alive
no
that
impossible
he
drank
off
the
wine
which
misset
had
poured
out
for
him
and
rose
from
his
chair
where
the
landlord
i
want
supper
i
want
besides
to
speak
to
him
and
he
staggered
towards
the
door
as
for
supper
said
misset
we
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
share
ours
travellers
should
be
friendly
caught
the
courier
by
the
arm
and
with
a
polite
speech
in
french
drew
him
again
down
into
his
chair
the
courier
stared
at
and
forgot
all
about
the
landlord
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
and
the
wine
and
the
had
gone
to
his
head
he
put
a
long
forefinger
on
knee
say
that
again
said
he
and
obeyed
a
slow
fat
smile
spread
all
over
the
courier
face
i
tell
my
wife
about
it
said
he
he
tried
to
clap
on
the
back
and
missing
him
fell
forward
with
his
face
on
the
table
the
next
minute
he
was
snoring
misset
walked
round
the
table
and
deftly
picked
his
pockets
there
was
a
package
in
one
of
them
superscribed
to
prince
taxis
the
governor
of
trent
misset
deliberately
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
contents
he
handed
the
package
to
who
read
it
and
then
flinging
it
upon
the
ground
danced
upon
it
misset
went
out
of
the
room
and
found
wogan
and
gaydon
keeping
watch
by
clementina
door
to
them
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
the
fellow
brings
letters
from
general
heister
to
the
governor
of
trent
to
stop
us
at
all
costs
but
his
letters
are
destroyed
and
he
lying
on
the
table
the
three
men
quickly
concerted
a
plan
the
princess
must
be
roused
a
start
must
be
made
at
once
and
must
be
left
behind
to
keep
a
watch
upon
the
courier
wogan
rapped
at
the
door
and
waked
clementina
he
sent
gaydon
to
the
stables
to
bribe
the
ostlers
and
with
misset
went
down
to
inform
however
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
nodding
surrounded
by
scraps
of
the
letter
which
he
had
danced
to
pieces
wogan
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
fatuously
he
means
to
tell
his
wife
he
said
with
a
foolish
gurgle
of
laughter
he
must
be
an
ass
i
do
think
if
i
had
a
wife
i
should
tell
her
would
you
wogan
tell
your
wife
if
you
had
one
misset
would
tell
his
wife
misset
interrupted
him
what
have
you
drank
since
i
went
out
of
the
room
he
asked
roughly
he
took
up
the
and
turned
it
it
was
quite
empty
only
water
said
dreamily
and
he
laughed
again
now
i
would
mind
telling
my
wife
that
said
he
misset
let
him
go
and
turned
with
a
gesture
of
despair
to
wogan
i
poured
my
flask
out
into
the
it
was
full
of
burnt
strasbourg
brandy
of
double
strength
it
is
as
potent
as
opium
neither
of
them
will
have
his
wits
before
it
will
not
help
us
to
leave
to
guard
the
courier
and
we
can
not
take
him
said
wogan
there
is
the
princess
to
be
thought
of
we
must
leave
him
and
we
can
not
leave
him
alone
for
his
neck
in
danger
more
than
in
danger
if
the
courier
wakes
before
him
he
picked
up
carefully
the
scraps
of
the
letter
and
placed
them
in
the
middle
of
the
fire
they
were
hardly
burnt
before
gaydon
came
into
the
room
with
word
that
horses
were
already
being
harnessed
to
the
berlin
wogan
explained
their
predicament
we
must
choose
which
of
us
three
shall
stay
behind
said
he
which
of
us
two
misset
corrected
pointing
to
gaydon
and
himself
when
the
princess
drives
into
bologna
charles
wogan
who
first
had
the
high
heart
to
dare
this
exploit
the
brain
to
plot
the
hand
to
execute
it
charles
wogan
must
ride
at
her
side
not
misset
not
gaydon
i
take
no
man
honours
he
shook
wogan
by
the
hand
as
he
spoke
and
he
had
spoken
with
an
extraordinary
warmth
of
admiration
gaydon
could
do
no
less
than
follow
his
companion
example
though
there
was
a
shade
of
embarrassment
in
his
manner
of
assenting
it
was
not
that
he
had
any
envy
of
wogan
or
any
desire
to
rob
him
of
a
single
tittle
of
his
due
credit
there
was
nothing
mean
in
gaydon
nature
but
here
was
a
halving
of
clementina
protectors
and
he
could
not
stifle
a
suspicion
that
the
best
man
of
the
four
to
leave
behind
was
really
charles
wogan
himself
not
a
word
however
of
this
could
he
say
and
so
he
nodded
his
assent
to
misset
proposal
it
is
i
then
who
stay
behind
with
and
the
courier
he
said
misset
has
a
wife
the
lot
evidently
falls
to
me
we
will
make
a
shift
somehow
or
another
to
keep
the
fellow
quiet
till
sundown
which
time
should
see
you
out
of
danger
he
unbuckled
the
sword
from
his
waist
and
laid
it
on
the
table
and
that
simple
action
somehow
touched
wogan
to
the
heart
he
slipped
his
arm
into
gaydon
and
said
remorsefully
dick
i
do
hate
to
leave
you
you
and
lucius
i
swept
you
into
the
peril
you
two
my
friends
and
now
i
leave
you
in
the
thick
of
it
to
find
a
way
out
for
yourselves
but
there
is
no
remedy
is
there
i
shall
not
rest
until
i
see
you
both
again
goodbye
lucius
he
looked
at
sprawling
with
outstretched
legs
upon
his
groaning
chair
my
six
feet
four
said
he
turning
to
gaydon
you
must
give
me
the
passport
have
a
good
care
of
him
dick
and
he
gripped
affectionately
by
the
arms
for
a
second
and
then
taking
the
passport
hurried
from
the
room
gaydon
had
seldom
seen
wogan
so
moved
the
berlin
was
brought
round
to
the
door
the
princess
rosy
with
sleep
stepped
into
it
wogan
had
brought
with
him
a
muff
and
he
slipped
it
over
clementina
feet
to
keep
her
warm
during
the
night
misset
took
gaydon
place
and
the
postillion
cracked
his
whip
and
set
off
towards
trent
gaydon
sitting
before
the
fire
in
the
parlour
heard
the
wheels
grate
upon
the
road
he
had
a
vision
of
the
berlin
thundering
through
the
night
with
a
trail
of
sparks
from
the
wheels
and
he
wondered
whether
misset
was
asleep
or
merely
leaning
back
with
his
eyes
shut
and
thus
visiting
incognito
woman
of
dreams
however
gaydon
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
chapter
xvii
but
gaydon
was
out
of
his
reckoning
there
were
no
fairy
tales
told
for
misset
to
overhear
and
the
princess
clementina
slept
in
her
corner
of
the
carriage
if
a
jolt
upon
a
stone
wakened
her
a
movement
opposite
told
her
that
her
sentinel
was
watchful
and
alert
three
times
the
berlin
stopped
for
a
change
of
horses
and
on
each
occasion
wogan
was
out
of
the
door
and
hurrying
the
ostlers
before
the
wheels
had
ceased
to
revolve
you
should
sleep
my
friend
said
she
not
till
we
reach
italy
he
replied
and
with
the
confidence
of
a
child
she
nestled
warmly
in
her
cloak
again
and
closed
her
eyes
this
feeling
of
security
was
a
new
luxury
to
her
after
the
months
of
anxiety
and
prison
the
grey
light
of
the
morning
stole
into
the
berlin
and
revealed
to
her
the
erect
and
tireless
figure
of
her
saviour
the
sun
leaped
down
the
and
the
grey
of
the
light
was
now
a
sparkling
gold
wogan
bade
her
highness
look
from
the
carriage
window
and
she
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
delight
on
her
left
rose
behind
away
to
the
towering
limestone
cliffs
of
monte
scanupia
on
her
right
the
white
peaks
of
the
orto
flashed
to
the
sun
and
between
the
hills
the
broad
valley
of
the
adige
rolled
southwards
a
summer
country
of
villages
and
vines
of
and
fields
of
maize
in
the
midst
of
which
rose
the
belfries
of
an
italian
town
this
is
italy
she
cried
but
the
emperor
italy
answered
wogan
and
at
nine
that
morning
the
carriage
stopped
in
the
public
square
of
trent
as
wogan
stepped
onto
the
ground
he
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
and
wrapped
in
that
cloud
men
on
horseback
like
soldiers
in
the
smoke
of
battle
he
heard
too
the
sound
of
wheels
the
prince
of
baden
had
that
instant
driven
away
and
he
had
taken
every
procurable
horse
in
the
town
wogan
own
horses
could
go
no
further
he
came
back
to
the
door
of
the
carriage
i
must
search
through
trent
said
he
on
the
mere
chance
of
finding
what
will
serve
us
your
highness
must
wait
in
the
inn
and
clementina
muffling
her
face
said
to
him
i
dare
not
my
face
is
known
in
trent
though
this
is
the
first
time
ever
i
saw
it
but
many
gentlemen
from
trent
came
to
the
innspruck
carnival
and
of
these
a
good
number
were
kind
enough
to
offer
me
their
hearts
they
were
allowed
to
besiege
me
to
their
content
i
must
needs
remain
in
the
shelter
of
the
carriage
wogan
left
misset
to
stand
sentinel
and
hurried
off
upon
his
business
he
ran
from
stable
to
stable
from
inn
to
inn
the
prince
of
baden
had
hired
horses
six
more
were
nowhere
to
be
found
wogan
would
be
content
with
four
he
ended
in
a
prayer
for
two
at
each
house
the
door
was
shut
in
his
face
wogan
was
in
despair
nowhere
could
delay
be
so
dangerous
as
at
trent
where
there
were
soldiers
and
a
governor
who
would
not
hesitate
to
act
without
orders
if
he
suspected
the
princess
clementina
was
escaping
through
his
town
two
hours
had
passed
in
wogan
vain
search
two
hours
of
daylight
during
which
clementina
had
sat
in
an
unharnessed
carriage
in
the
market
square
wogan
ran
back
to
the
square
half
expecting
to
find
that
she
had
been
recognised
and
arrested
as
he
reached
the
square
he
saw
that
curious
people
were
loitering
about
the
carriage
as
he
pushed
through
them
he
heard
them
questioning
why
travellers
should
on
so
hot
a
morning
of
spring
sit
muffled
up
in
a
close
dark
carriage
when
they
could
take
their
ease
beneath
trees
in
the
one
man
laughed
out
at
the
princess
and
the
comical
figure
she
made
with
her
scarlet
cloak
drawn
tight
about
her
face
wogan
himself
had
bought
that
cloak
in
strasbourg
to
guard
his
princess
from
the
cold
of
the
brenner
and
guessed
what
discomfort
its
ermine
lining
must
now
be
costing
her
and
this
lout
dared
to
laugh
and
make
her
this
incomparable
woman
a
butt
for
his
ridicule
wogan
took
a
step
towards
the
fellow
with
his
fists
clenched
but
thought
the
better
of
his
impulse
and
turning
away
ran
to
the
palace
of
prince
taxis
this
desperate
course
alone
remained
to
him
he
must
have
speech
with
the
himself
at
the
palace
however
he
was
informed
that
the
prince
was
in
bed
with
the
gout
wogan
however
insisted
you
will
present
my
duties
to
the
prince
you
will
show
him
my
passport
you
will
say
that
the
count
of
cernes
has
business
of
the
last
importance
in
italy
and
begs
permission
since
the
prince
of
baden
has
hired
every
in
the
town
to
requisition
half
a
dozen
from
the
fields
wogan
kicked
his
heels
in
the
courtyard
while
the
message
was
taken
at
any
moment
some
rumour
of
the
curious
spectacle
in
the
square
might
be
brought
to
the
palace
and
excite
inquiry
there
might
be
another
courier
in
pursuit
besides
the
man
whom
gaydon
kept
a
prisoner
wogan
was
devoured
with
a
fever
of
impatience
it
seemed
to
him
hours
before
the
prince
secretary
returned
to
him
the
secretary
handed
him
back
his
passport
and
on
the
part
of
the
prince
made
a
speech
full
of
civilities
here
a
great
deal
of
jam
sir
said
wogan
i
misdoubt
me
but
what
there
a
most
unpalatable
pill
hidden
away
in
it
indeed
said
the
secretary
the
prince
begs
you
to
be
content
and
to
wait
for
the
to
return
ah
ah
cried
wogan
but
that
the
one
thing
i
can
not
do
i
must
speak
plainly
it
appears
he
drew
the
secretary
out
of
and
resumed
my
particular
business
is
to
catch
up
the
prince
of
baden
he
is
summoned
back
to
innspruck
do
you
understand
he
asked
significantly
sir
we
are
well
informed
in
trent
as
to
the
emperor
wishes
said
the
secretary
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
no
no
my
friend
said
wogan
it
is
not
by
the
emperor
the
prince
of
baden
is
summoned
though
i
have
no
doubt
the
summons
is
much
to
his
taste
the
secretary
stepped
back
in
surprise
by
her
highness
the
princess
he
exclaimed
she
changes
her
mind
she
is
willing
where
before
she
was
obdurate
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
prince
plied
her
too
hard
and
she
would
have
none
of
him
now
that
he
turns
his
back
and
puts
the
miles
as
fast
as
he
can
between
himself
and
her
she
can
not
sleep
for
want
of
him
the
secretary
nodded
his
head
sagaciously
her
highness
is
a
woman
said
he
and
that
explains
all
but
it
will
do
her
no
harm
to
suffer
a
little
longer
for
her
obstinacy
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
prince
taxis
is
so
tormented
with
the
gout
that
that
you
are
unwilling
to
approach
him
a
second
time
interrupted
wogan
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
i
have
myself
seen
prelates
in
a
most
unprelatical
mood
but
here
is
a
case
where
needs
must
i
have
not
told
you
all
there
is
a
devil
of
a
fellow
called
charles
wogan
the
secretary
nodded
his
head
a
mad
irishman
who
has
vowed
to
free
her
highness
he
has
set
out
from
strasbourg
with
that
aim
he
will
hang
for
it
then
but
he
will
never
rescue
her
and
the
secretary
began
to
laugh
i
can
not
upon
my
honour
vex
the
prince
again
because
a
has
prated
in
his
cups
no
no
said
wogan
you
do
not
follow
me
charles
wogan
will
come
to
the
gallows
over
this
adventure
for
my
part
i
would
have
him
broken
on
the
wheel
and
tortured
in
many
uncomfortable
ways
these
irishmen
all
the
world
over
are
pestilent
fellows
but
the
trouble
is
this
if
her
highness
hears
of
his
attempt
she
is
as
you
sagely
discovered
a
woman
a
trivial
trifling
thing
she
will
be
absurd
enough
to
imagine
her
rescue
possible
she
will
again
change
her
mind
and
it
is
precisely
that
which
general
heister
fears
he
would
have
her
formally
betrothed
to
the
prince
of
baden
before
charles
wogan
is
caught
and
hanged
therefore
since
i
was
pressing
into
italy
he
charged
me
with
this
message
to
the
prince
of
baden
now
observe
this
if
you
please
suppose
that
i
do
not
overtake
the
prince
suppose
that
her
highness
hears
of
wogan
coming
and
again
changes
her
mind
who
will
be
to
blame
not
i
for
i
have
done
my
best
not
prince
taxis
for
he
is
not
informed
but
prince
taxis
secretary
the
secretary
yielded
to
wogan
argument
he
might
be
in
a
great
fear
of
prince
taxis
but
he
was
in
a
greater
of
the
emperor
wrath
he
left
wogan
again
and
in
a
little
while
came
back
with
the
written
permission
which
wogan
desired
wogan
wasted
no
time
in
unnecessary
civilities
the
morning
had
already
been
wasted
the
clocks
were
striking
one
as
he
hurried
away
from
the
palace
and
before
two
the
princess
clementina
was
able
to
throw
back
her
cloak
from
about
her
face
and
take
the
air
for
the
berlin
was
on
the
road
from
trent
to
roveredo
those
were
the
four
worst
hours
since
we
left
innspruck
she
said
i
thought
i
should
suffocate
the
revulsion
from
despair
the
knowledge
that
each
beat
of
the
hoofs
brought
them
nearer
to
safety
the
glow
of
the
sun
upon
a
country
which
was
italy
in
all
but
name
raised
them
all
to
the
top
of
their
spirits
clementina
was
in
her
gayest
mood
she
lavished
caresses
upon
her
little
woman
as
she
called
misset
she
would
have
wogan
give
her
an
account
of
his
interview
with
prince
taxis
secretary
she
laughed
with
the
merriest
enjoyment
over
his
abuse
of
charles
wogan
but
it
was
not
myself
alone
whom
i
slandered
said
he
your
highness
had
a
share
of
our
abuse
our
heads
wagged
gravely
over
inconstancies
it
was
not
in
nature
but
you
must
change
your
mind
indeed
your
highness
would
have
laughed
but
at
all
events
her
highness
did
not
laugh
now
on
the
contrary
her
eyes
lost
all
their
merriment
and
her
blood
rushed
hotly
into
her
cheeks
she
became
for
that
afternoon
a
creature
of
moods
now
talking
quickly
and
perhaps
a
trifle
wildly
now
relapsing
into
long
silences
wogan
was
troubled
by
a
thought
that
the
strain
of
her
journey
was
telling
its
tale
even
upon
her
vigorous
youth
it
may
be
that
she
noted
his
look
of
anxiety
but
she
said
to
him
abruptly
and
with
a
sort
of
rebellion
you
would
despise
any
woman
who
had
the
temerity
to
change
her
mind
nay
i
do
not
say
that
but
it
is
merely
politeness
that
restrains
you
you
would
despise
her
judging
her
by
men
when
a
man
changes
his
mind
why
it
is
so
he
changes
his
mind
but
when
a
girl
does
it
may
well
be
that
for
the
first
time
she
is
seriously
exercising
her
judgment
for
her
upbringing
renders
it
natural
that
she
should
allow
others
to
make
up
her
mind
for
her
at
the
first
that
i
think
is
very
true
said
wogan
clementina
however
was
not
satisfied
with
his
assent
she
attacked
him
again
and
almost
vindictively
you
of
course
would
never
change
your
mind
for
any
reason
once
it
was
fixed
you
are
resolute
you
are
quite
quite
perfect
wogan
could
not
imagine
what
he
had
done
thus
to
provoke
her
irony
madam
he
pleaded
i
am
not
in
truth
so
obstinate
a
fellow
as
you
make
me
out
i
have
often
changed
my
mind
i
take
some
pride
in
it
on
occasion
her
highness
inclined
to
a
greater
graciousness
i
am
glad
to
know
it
you
shall
give
me
examples
one
may
have
a
stiff
neck
and
yet
no
cause
for
pride
wogan
looked
so
under
this
reproof
that
clementina
suddenly
broke
out
into
a
laugh
and
so
showed
herself
in
a
fresh
and
more
familiar
mood
the
continued
she
sat
opposite
to
wogan
if
she
moved
her
hand
her
knee
her
foot
must
needs
touch
his
she
made
him
tell
her
stories
of
his
campaigns
and
so
the
evening
came
upon
them
an
evening
of
stars
and
mysterious
quiet
and
a
clear
dark
sky
they
passed
roveredo
they
drew
near
to
ala
the
last
village
in
the
emperor
territories
five
miles
beyond
ala
they
would
be
on
venetian
soil
and
already
they
saw
the
lights
of
the
village
twinkling
like
so
many
golden
candles
but
the
berlin
which
had
drawn
them
so
stoutly
over
these
rugged
failed
them
at
the
last
one
of
the
hind
wheels
jolted
violently
upon
a
great
stone
there
was
a
sudden
cracking
of
wood
and
the
carriage
lurched
over
throwing
its
occupants
one
against
the
other
wogan
disentangled
himself
opened
the
door
and
sprang
out
he
sprang
out
into
a
pool
of
water
one
glance
at
the
carriage
dark
though
the
night
was
told
him
surely
what
had
happened
the
was
broken
he
saw
that
clementina
was
about
to
follow
him
there
is
water
said
he
it
is
and
no
white
stone
she
answered
with
a
laugh
whereon
i
can
safely
set
my
foot
no
said
he
but
you
can
trust
without
fear
to
my
arms
and
he
reached
them
out
to
her
can
i
said
she
in
a
curious
voice
and
when
he
had
lifted
her
from
the
carriage
she
was
aware
that
she
could
not
he
lifted
her
daintily
like
a
piece
of
porcelain
but
to
lift
her
was
not
enough
he
must
carry
her
his
arms
tightened
about
her
waist
hers
in
spite
of
herself
about
his
shoulders
he
took
a
step
or
two
from
the
carriage
with
the
water
washing
over
his
boots
and
the
respectful
support
of
a
servant
became
the
warm
grip
of
a
man
he
no
longer
held
her
daintily
he
clipped
her
close
to
him
straining
her
breasts
against
his
chest
he
was
on
fire
with
her
she
could
not
but
know
it
his
arms
shook
his
bosom
heaved
she
felt
the
quick
hammering
of
his
heart
and
a
murmur
an
inarticulate
murmur
of
infinite
longing
trembled
from
his
throat
and
something
of
his
madness
passed
into
her
and
made
a
sweet
tumult
in
her
blood
he
stopped
still
holding
her
he
felt
her
fingers
clasp
tighter
he
looked
downwards
into
her
face
upturned
to
his
they
were
alone
for
a
moment
these
two
alone
in
an
uninhabited
world
the
broken
carriage
the
busy
fingers
about
it
the
smoking
horses
the
lights
of
ala
twinkling
in
the
valley
had
not
even
the
substance
of
shadows
they
simply
were
not
and
they
never
had
been
there
were
just
two
people
alive
between
the
poles
not
princess
and
servant
but
man
and
woman
in
the
primitive
relationship
of
rescuer
and
rescued
and
they
stood
in
the
dark
of
a
translucent
night
of
spring
with
the
stars
throbbing
above
them
to
the
time
of
their
passionate
hearts
and
the
earth
stretching
about
them
rich
as
black
velvet
he
looked
down
into
her
eyes
as
once
in
the
he
had
done
before
and
again
he
marvelled
at
their
steadiness
and
their
mysterious
depths
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
and
did
not
flinch
her
arms
were
close
about
his
neck
he
bent
his
head
towards
her
and
she
said
in
a
queer
toneless
voice
low
but
as
steady
as
her
eyes
i
know
ah
but
well
i
know
last
night
i
dreamed
i
rode
on
your
black
horse
into
your
city
of
dreams
and
the
moment
of
passion
ended
in
farce
for
wogan
startled
by
the
words
set
her
down
there
and
then
into
the
pool
she
stood
over
her
ankles
in
water
she
uttered
a
little
cry
and
shivered
then
she
laughed
and
sprang
lightly
onto
dry
soil
making
much
of
her
companion
awkwardness
wogan
joined
in
the
laughter
finding
therein
as
she
did
a
cover
and
a
cloak
we
must
walk
to
ala
said
he
it
is
as
well
said
she
there
was
a
time
when
cavaliers
laid
their
cloaks
in
the
mud
to
save
a
lady
madam
said
wogan
the
chivalry
of
has
the
same
intention
but
in
its
effect
said
she
it
is
more
rheumatical
wogan
searched
in
the
carriage
and
drew
out
a
coil
of
rope
which
he
slung
across
his
shoulders
like
a
bandolier
clementina
laughed
at
him
for
his
precautions
but
wogan
was
very
serious
i
would
not
part
with
it
said
he
i
never
travelled
for
four
days
without
being
put
to
it
for
a
piece
of
rope
they
left
the
postillion
to
make
what
he
could
of
the
berlin
and
walked
forward
in
the
clear
night
to
ala
the
shock
of
the
tumble
had
alarmed
misset
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
had
strained
her
endurance
to
the
utmost
she
made
no
complaint
but
she
could
walk
but
slowly
and
with
many
rests
by
the
way
it
took
a
long
while
for
them
to
reach
the
village
they
saw
the
lights
diminish
in
the
houses
the
stars
grew
pale
there
came
a
hint
of
morning
in
the
air
the
laughter
at
awkwardness
had
long
since
died
away
and
they
walked
in
silence
hours
had
passed
since
the
berlin
left
innspruck
hours
ago
clementina
knew
wogan
secret
now
he
was
aware
that
she
knew
it
they
could
not
look
into
each
other
faces
but
their
eyes
conversed
of
it
if
they
turned
their
heads
sharply
away
that
aversion
of
their
gaze
spoke
no
less
clearly
there
was
a
link
between
them
now
and
a
secret
link
the
sweeter
on
that
account
perhaps
certainly
the
more
dangerous
the
cloud
had
grown
much
bigger
than
a
man
hand
moreover
she
had
never
seen
james
stuart
she
had
his
picture
it
is
true
but
the
picture
could
not
recall
it
must
create
not
revivify
his
image
to
her
thoughts
and
that
it
could
not
do
so
that
he
remained
a
shadowy
figure
to
her
a
mere
number
of
features
almost
an
abstraction
on
the
other
hand
the
king
emissary
walked
by
her
side
sat
sleepless
before
her
had
held
her
in
his
arms
had
talked
with
her
had
risked
his
life
for
her
she
knew
him
what
she
knew
of
james
stuart
she
knew
chiefly
from
the
lips
of
this
emissary
on
this
walk
to
ala
he
spoke
of
his
master
and
remorsefully
in
the
highest
praise
but
she
knew
his
secret
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
and
therefore
every
remorseful
loyal
word
he
spoke
praised
him
more
than
it
praised
his
master
and
it
happened
that
just
as
they
came
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
she
dropped
a
handkerchief
which
hung
loosely
about
her
neck
for
a
moment
she
did
not
remark
her
loss
when
she
did
and
turned
she
saw
that
her
companion
was
rising
from
the
ground
on
which
no
handkerchief
longer
lay
and
that
he
had
his
right
hand
in
his
breast
she
turned
again
without
a
word
and
walked
forward
but
she
knew
that
kerchief
was
against
his
heart
and
the
cloud
still
grew
chapter
xviii
they
reached
ala
towards
two
of
the
morning
the
town
had
some
reputation
in
those
days
for
its
velvets
and
silks
and
wogan
made
no
doubt
that
somewhere
he
would
procure
a
carriage
to
convey
them
the
necessary
five
miles
into
venetian
territory
the
prince
of
baden
was
still
ahead
of
them
however
the
inn
of
the
golden
lion
had
not
a
single
horse
fit
for
their
use
in
its
stables
wogan
however
obtained
there
a
few
likely
addresses
and
set
out
alone
upon
his
search
he
returned
in
a
couple
of
hours
with
a
little
cart
drawn
by
a
pony
and
sent
word
within
that
he
was
ready
clementina
herself
with
her
hood
thrown
back
from
her
face
came
out
to
him
at
the
door
an
oil
lamp
swung
in
the
passage
and
lit
up
her
face
wogan
could
see
that
the
face
was
grave
and
anxious
your
highness
and
misset
can
ride
in
the
cart
it
has
no
springs
to
be
sure
and
may
shake
to
pieces
like
plaster
but
if
it
carries
you
five
miles
it
will
serve
misset
and
i
can
run
by
the
side
but
lucy
misset
must
not
go
said
clementina
she
is
ill
and
no
wonder
she
must
not
take
one
step
more
there
would
be
great
danger
and
indeed
she
has
endured
enough
for
me
the
gravity
of
the
girl
face
as
much
as
her
words
convinced
wogan
that
here
was
no
occasion
for
encouragement
or
resistance
he
said
with
some
embarrassment
yet
we
can
not
leave
her
here
alone
and
of
us
two
men
her
husband
must
stay
with
her
dare
we
wait
till
the
morning
asked
clementina
lucy
may
be
recovered
then
wogan
shook
his
head
the
courier
we
stopped
at
wellishmile
was
not
the
only
man
sent
after
us
of
that
we
may
be
very
sure
here
are
we
five
miles
from
safety
and
while
those
five
miles
are
still
unbridged
listen
wogan
leaned
his
head
forward
and
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
in
the
still
night
they
could
hear
far
away
the
galloping
of
a
horse
the
sound
grew
more
distinct
as
they
listened
the
rider
comes
from
italy
said
clementina
but
he
might
have
come
from
trent
cried
wogan
we
left
trent
behind
twelve
hours
ago
and
more
for
twelve
hours
we
crept
and
crawled
along
the
road
these
last
miles
we
have
walked
any
moment
the
emperor
troopers
might
come
riding
after
us
ah
but
we
are
not
safe
i
am
afraid
clementina
turned
sharply
towards
him
as
he
spoke
this
unwonted
confession
you
she
exclaimed
with
a
wondering
laugh
yet
he
had
spoken
the
truth
his
face
was
twitching
his
eyes
had
the
look
of
a
man
scared
out
of
his
wits
yes
i
am
afraid
he
said
in
a
low
uneasy
voice
when
i
have
all
but
won
through
the
danger
then
comes
my
moment
of
fear
in
the
thick
of
it
perils
tread
too
close
upon
the
heels
of
peril
for
a
man
to
count
them
up
each
minute
claims
your
hands
and
eyes
and
brain
claims
you
and
inspires
you
but
when
the
danger
less
and
though
less
still
threatens
when
you
just
this
side
of
safety
frontier
and
not
safe
indeed
indeed
one
should
be
afraid
a
vain
spirit
of
confidence
and
the
tired
head
nods
and
the
blow
falls
on
it
from
nowhere
oh
but
i
have
seen
examples
times
out
of
mind
i
beg
you
no
delay
the
hoofs
of
the
approaching
horse
sounded
ever
louder
while
wogan
spoke
and
as
he
ended
a
man
rode
out
from
the
street
into
the
open
space
before
the
inn
the
gallop
became
a
trot
he
is
riding
to
the
door
said
wogan
the
light
falls
on
your
face
and
he
drew
clementina
into
the
shadow
of
the
wall
but
at
the
same
moment
the
rider
changed
his
mind
he
swerved
it
seemed
too
that
he
used
his
spurs
for
his
horse
bounded
beneath
him
and
galloped
past
the
inn
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
and
the
sound
of
the
horse
diminished
wogan
listened
until
they
had
died
away
he
rides
into
austria
said
he
he
rides
to
trent
to
brixen
to
innspruck
and
in
haste
let
us
go
i
had
even
a
fancy
that
i
knew
his
voice
from
a
single
oath
uttered
in
anger
nay
you
are
all
fears
for
my
part
i
was
afraid
that
he
had
it
in
his
mind
to
stay
here
at
this
inn
where
my
little
woman
lies
what
if
suspicion
fall
on
her
what
if
those
troopers
of
the
emperor
find
her
and
guess
the
part
she
played
you
make
her
safe
by
seeking
safety
returned
wogan
you
are
the
prey
the
emperor
flies
at
once
you
are
out
of
reach
his
mere
dignity
must
hold
him
in
from
wreaking
vengeance
on
your
friends
wogan
went
into
the
inn
and
calling
misset
told
him
of
his
purpose
he
would
drive
her
highness
to
peri
a
little
village
ten
miles
from
ala
but
in
italy
at
peri
misset
and
her
husband
were
to
rejoin
them
in
the
morning
and
from
peri
they
could
travel
by
slow
stages
to
bologna
the
tears
flowed
from
clementina
eyes
when
she
took
her
farewell
of
her
little
woman
though
her
reason
bowed
to
argument
she
had
a
sense
of
cowardice
in
deserting
so
faithful
a
friend
misset
however
joined
in
wogan
prayer
and
she
mounted
into
the
trap
and
at
wogan
side
drove
out
of
the
town
by
that
street
along
which
the
horseman
had
ridden
clementina
was
silent
her
driver
was
no
more
talkative
they
were
alone
and
together
on
the
road
to
italy
that
embarrassment
from
which
confession
of
fear
had
procured
them
some
respite
held
them
in
a
stiff
constraint
they
were
conscious
of
it
as
of
a
tide
engulfing
them
neither
dared
to
speak
dreading
what
might
come
of
speech
the
most
careless
question
the
most
indifferent
comment
might
as
it
seemed
to
both
be
the
spark
to
fire
a
mine
neither
had
any
confidence
to
say
once
they
had
begun
to
talk
whither
the
talk
would
lead
but
they
were
very
much
afraid
and
they
sat
very
still
lest
a
movement
of
the
one
should
provoke
a
question
in
the
other
she
knew
his
secret
and
he
was
aware
that
she
knew
it
she
could
not
have
found
it
even
then
in
her
heart
to
part
willingly
with
her
knowledge
she
had
thought
upon
it
during
the
last
day
she
had
withdrawn
herself
into
it
from
the
company
of
her
as
into
a
private
chamber
it
was
familiar
and
near
nor
would
wogan
have
desired
now
that
she
had
the
knowledge
to
deprive
her
of
it
but
he
knew
it
instinctively
for
a
dangerous
thing
he
drove
on
in
silence
while
the
stars
paled
in
the
heavens
and
a
grey
pure
light
crept
mistily
up
from
the
under
edges
of
the
world
and
the
morning
broke
hard
and
empty
and
cheerless
wogan
suddenly
drew
in
the
reins
and
stopped
the
cart
there
is
a
high
wall
behind
us
it
stretches
across
the
fields
from
either
side
said
he
it
makes
a
gateway
of
the
road
clementina
turned
the
wall
was
perhaps
ten
yards
behind
them
a
gateway
said
she
through
which
we
have
passed
the
gateway
of
italy
answered
wogan
and
he
drew
the
lash
once
or
twice
across
the
pony
back
and
so
was
silent
clementina
looked
at
his
set
and
cheerless
face
cheerless
as
that
chill
morning
and
she
too
was
silent
she
looked
back
along
the
road
which
she
had
traversed
through
snow
and
sunshine
and
clear
nights
of
stars
she
saw
it
winding
out
from
the
gates
of
innspruck
over
the
mountains
above
the
foaming
river
and
after
a
while
she
said
very
wistfully
there
are
worse
lives
than
a
gipsy
are
there
any
better
answered
wogan
so
this
was
what
wogan
fine
project
had
come
to
he
remembered
another
morning
when
the
light
had
welled
over
the
hills
sunless
and
clear
and
cold
on
the
road
to
bologna
the
morning
of
the
day
when
he
had
first
conceived
the
rescue
of
clementina
and
the
rescue
had
been
effected
and
here
was
clementina
safe
out
of
austria
and
wogan
sure
of
a
deathless
renown
of
the
accomplishment
of
an
endeavour
held
absurd
and
preposterous
and
these
two
short
sentences
were
their
summary
and
comment
there
are
worse
lives
than
a
gipsy
are
there
any
better
both
had
at
this
supreme
crisis
of
their
fortunes
but
the
one
thought
that
the
only
days
through
which
they
had
really
lived
were
those
last
two
days
of
flight
of
hurry
of
hope
alternating
with
despair
of
companionship
days
never
to
be
forgotten
when
each
snatched
meal
was
a
picnic
seasoned
with
laughter
days
of
unharnessed
freedom
lived
in
the
open
air
clementina
was
the
first
to
perceive
that
her
behaviour
fell
below
the
occasion
she
was
safe
in
italy
journeying
henceforward
safely
to
her
betrothed
she
spurred
herself
to
understand
it
she
forced
her
lips
to
sing
aloud
the
te
deum
wogan
looked
at
her
in
surprise
as
the
first
notes
were
sung
and
the
woful
appeal
in
her
eyes
compelled
him
to
as
brave
a
show
as
he
could
make
of
joining
in
the
hymn
but
the
words
faltered
the
tune
wavered
joyless
and
hollow
in
that
empty
morning
drive
on
said
clementina
suddenly
and
she
had
a
sense
that
she
was
being
driven
into
bondage
she
who
had
just
been
freed
wogan
drove
on
towards
peri
it
was
the
morning
of
sunday
the
of
april
and
as
the
little
cart
drew
near
to
this
hamlet
of
thirty
cottages
the
travellers
could
hear
the
single
bell
in
the
church
belfry
calling
the
villagers
to
mass
wogan
spoke
but
once
to
clementina
and
then
only
to
point
out
a
wooden
hut
which
stood
picturesquely
on
a
wooded
bluff
of
monte
lessini
high
up
upon
the
left
a
narrow
gorge
down
which
a
torrent
foamed
led
upwards
to
the
bluff
and
the
hut
of
which
the
windows
were
shuttered
and
which
seemed
at
that
distance
to
have
been
built
with
an
unusual
elegance
was
to
wogan
thinking
a
clementina
looked
up
at
the
bluff
indifferently
and
made
no
answer
she
only
spoke
as
wogan
drove
past
the
and
the
sound
of
the
priest
voice
came
droning
out
to
them
will
you
wait
for
me
she
asked
i
will
not
be
long
wogan
stopped
the
pony
you
would
give
thanks
said
he
i
understand
i
would
pray
for
an
honest
heart
wherewith
to
give
honest
thanks
said
clementina
in
a
low
voice
and
she
added
hastily
there
is
a
life
of
ceremonies
there
is
a
life
of
cities
before
me
i
have
lived
under
the
skies
these
last
two
days
she
went
into
the
church
shrouding
her
face
in
her
hood
and
kneeled
down
before
a
rush
chair
close
to
the
door
a
sense
of
gratitude
however
was
not
that
morning
to
be
got
by
any
prayers
however
earnest
it
was
merely
a
distaste
for
ceremonies
and
observances
she
strenuously
assured
herself
that
had
grown
upon
her
during
these
ten
days
she
sought
to
get
rid
of
that
distaste
as
she
kneeled
by
picturing
in
her
thoughts
the
prince
to
whom
she
was
betrothed
she
recalled
the
exploits
the
virtues
which
wogan
had
ascribed
to
him
she
stamped
them
upon
the
picture
it
is
the
king
she
said
to
herself
and
the
picture
answered
her
it
is
the
king
servant
and
lo
the
face
of
the
picture
was
the
face
of
charles
wogan
she
covered
her
cheeks
with
her
hands
in
a
burning
rush
of
shame
she
struck
in
her
thoughts
at
the
face
of
that
image
with
her
clenched
fists
to
bruise
to
annihilate
it
it
is
the
king
it
is
the
king
it
is
the
king
she
cried
in
her
remorse
but
the
image
persisted
it
still
wore
the
likeness
of
charles
wogan
it
still
repeated
no
it
is
the
king
servant
there
was
more
of
the
primitive
woman
in
this
girl
bred
in
the
rugged
of
silesia
than
even
wogan
was
aware
of
and
during
the
halts
in
their
journey
she
had
learned
from
misset
details
which
wogan
had
been
at
pains
to
conceal
it
was
wogan
who
had
conceived
the
idea
of
her
rescue
in
the
king
place
in
the
king
place
wogan
had
come
to
innspruck
and
effected
it
in
the
king
place
he
had
taken
her
by
the
hand
and
cleft
a
way
for
her
through
her
enemies
he
was
the
man
the
rescuer
she
was
the
woman
the
rescued
she
became
conscious
of
the
futility
of
her
attitude
of
prayer
she
raised
her
head
and
saw
that
a
man
kneeling
close
to
the
altar
had
turned
and
was
staring
fixedly
towards
her
the
man
was
the
prince
of
baden
had
he
recognised
her
she
peered
between
her
fingers
she
remarked
that
his
gaze
was
puzzled
he
was
not
then
sure
though
he
suspected
she
waited
until
he
turned
his
head
again
and
then
she
silently
rose
to
her
feet
and
slipped
out
of
the
church
she
found
wogan
waiting
for
her
in
some
anxiety
did
he
recognise
you
he
asked
he
was
not
sure
answered
clementina
how
did
you
know
he
was
at
mass
a
native
i
spoke
with
told
me
clementina
climbed
up
into
the
cart
the
prince
is
not
a
generous
man
she
said
hesitatingly
wogan
understood
her
the
prince
of
baden
must
not
know
that
she
had
come
to
peri
escorted
by
a
single
cavalier
he
would
talk
bitterly
he
would
make
much
of
his
good
fortune
in
that
he
had
not
married
the
princess
clementina
he
would
pity
the
chevalier
de
george
there
was
a
fine
tale
there
wogan
could
trace
it
across
the
of
europe
and
hear
the
malicious
inextinguishable
laughter
which
winged
it
on
its
way
he
drove
off
quickly
from
the
church
door
he
leaves
peri
at
nine
said
wogan
he
will
have
no
time
to
make
inquiries
we
have
but
to
avoid
the
inn
he
stays
at
there
is
a
second
at
the
head
of
the
village
which
we
passed
to
this
second
inn
wogan
drove
and
was
welcomed
by
a
shrewish
woman
whose
sour
face
was
warmed
for
once
in
a
way
into
something
like
enthusiasm
a
lodging
indeed
you
shall
have
cried
she
and
a
better
lodging
than
the
prince
of
baden
can
look
back
upon
though
he
pay
never
so
dearly
for
it
poor
man
he
will
have
slept
wakefully
this
night
here
sir
you
will
find
honest
board
and
an
honest
bed
for
yourself
and
your
sweet
lady
and
an
honest
bill
to
set
you
off
in
a
sweet
humour
in
the
morning
nay
my
good
woman
interrupted
wogan
hastily
this
is
no
sweet
lady
of
mine
nor
are
we
like
to
stay
until
the
morrow
the
truth
is
we
are
a
party
of
four
but
our
carriage
snapped
its
axle
some
miles
back
the
young
lady
uncle
and
aunt
are
following
us
and
we
wait
only
for
their
arrival
wogan
examined
the
inn
and
thought
the
disposition
of
it
very
convenient
it
made
three
sides
of
a
courtyard
open
to
the
road
on
the
right
and
the
bottom
were
and
a
stable
the
inn
was
the
wing
upon
the
left
hand
the
guest
rooms
of
which
there
were
four
were
all
situated
upon
the
first
floor
and
looked
out
upon
a
little
thicket
of
at
the
back
of
the
wing
they
were
approached
by
a
staircase
which
ran
up
with
a
couple
of
turns
from
the
courtyard
itself
and
on
the
outside
of
the
wogan
was
very
pleased
with
that
staircase
it
was
narrow
he
was
pleased
too
because
there
were
no
other
travellers
in
the
inn
he
went
back
to
the
landlady
it
is
very
likely
said
he
that
my
friends
when
they
come
will
after
all
choose
to
stay
here
for
the
night
i
will
hire
all
the
rooms
upon
the
first
floor
the
landlady
was
no
less
pleased
than
wogan
she
had
a
thought
that
they
were
a
runaway
couple
and
served
them
breakfast
in
a
little
parlour
up
the
stairs
with
many
sly
and
confusing
allusions
she
became
confused
however
when
after
breakfast
clementina
withdrew
to
bed
and
wogan
sauntered
out
into
the
where
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
bank
to
watch
for
captain
misset
all
day
he
sat
resolutely
with
his
back
towards
the
inn
the
landlady
inferred
that
here
were
lovers
quarrelling
and
she
was
yet
more
convinced
of
it
when
she
entered
the
parlour
in
the
afternoon
to
lay
the
table
for
dinner
and
saw
clementina
standing
wistfully
at
the
window
with
her
eyes
upon
that
unmoving
back
wogan
meanwhile
for
all
his
vigilance
watched
the
road
but
merchants
pedlars
friars
and
gentlemen
travelling
for
their
pleasure
passed
down
the
road
into
italy
wogan
saw
them
not
or
saw
them
with
unseeing
eyes
his
eyes
were
turned
inwards
and
he
gazed
at
a
picture
that
his
heart
held
of
a
room
in
that
inn
behind
him
where
after
all
her
dangers
and
fatigues
a
woman
slept
in
peace
towards
evening
fewer
travellers
passed
by
but
there
came
one
party
of
six
men
whose
leader
suddenly
bowed
his
head
down
upon
his
horse
neck
as
he
rode
past
wogan
had
preached
a
sermon
on
the
carelessness
which
comes
with
danger
diminutions
but
he
was
very
tired
the
head
was
nodding
the
blow
might
fall
from
nowhere
and
he
not
know
at
nightfall
he
returned
and
mounted
to
the
parlour
where
clementina
awaited
him
there
is
no
sign
of
captain
misset
said
he
wogan
was
puzzled
by
the
way
in
which
clementina
received
the
news
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
her
eyes
lightened
and
that
she
was
glad
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
eyes
clouded
and
suddenly
as
if
with
pain
nor
was
her
voice
a
guide
to
him
for
she
spoke
her
simple
question
without
significance
must
we
wait
then
till
the
morning
there
is
a
chance
that
they
may
come
before
the
morning
i
will
watch
on
the
top
stair
and
if
they
come
i
will
make
bold
to
wake
your
highness
their
hostess
upon
this
brought
their
supper
into
the
room
and
wogan
became
at
once
aware
of
a
change
in
her
demeanour
she
no
longer
embarrassed
them
with
her
patronage
nor
did
she
continue
her
sly
allusions
to
the
escapades
of
lovers
on
the
contrary
she
was
of
an
extreme
deference
under
the
deference
too
wogan
seemed
to
remark
a
certain
excitement
have
you
other
lodgers
he
asked
carelessly
no
sir
said
she
travellers
are
taken
by
a
big
house
and
a
bustle
of
servants
they
stay
at
the
vapore
inn
when
they
stay
at
peri
and
to
their
cost
as
soon
as
she
had
left
the
room
wogan
asked
of
clementina
when
did
her
manner
change
i
had
not
remarked
the
change
till
now
replied
clementina
wogan
became
uneasy
he
went
down
into
the
courtyard
and
found
it
empty
there
was
a
light
in
the
kitchen
and
he
entered
the
room
the
landlady
was
having
her
supper
in
company
with
her
few
servants
and
there
were
one
or
two
peasants
from
the
village
wogan
chatted
with
them
for
a
few
minutes
and
came
out
again
much
relieved
of
his
fears
he
thought
however
it
might
be
as
well
to
see
that
his
pony
was
ready
for
an
emergency
he
crossed
silently
to
the
stable
which
he
found
dark
as
the
courtyard
the
door
was
latched
but
not
locked
he
opened
it
and
went
in
the
building
was
long
with
many
stalls
ranged
side
by
side
wogan
pony
stood
in
the
end
stall
opposite
to
the
door
wogan
took
down
the
harness
from
the
pegs
and
began
to
fix
it
ready
on
the
pony
he
had
just
put
the
collar
over
its
head
when
he
heard
a
horse
stamping
in
one
of
the
stalls
at
the
other
end
of
the
stables
now
he
had
noticed
in
the
morning
that
there
were
only
two
horses
in
the
building
and
those
two
were
tied
up
in
the
stalls
next
to
that
which
his
pony
occupied
he
walked
along
the
range
of
stalls
the
two
horses
were
there
then
came
a
gap
of
empty
stalls
and
beyond
the
gap
he
counted
six
other
horses
wogan
became
at
once
curious
about
those
six
other
horses
they
might
of
course
be
but
he
wished
to
know
it
was
quite
dark
within
the
building
he
had
only
counted
the
horses
by
the
noise
of
their
movements
in
their
stalls
the
rattle
of
their
and
the
pawing
of
their
feet
he
dared
not
light
a
lamp
but
horses
as
a
rule
knew
him
for
a
friend
he
went
into
the
stall
of
the
first
petted
it
for
a
moment
and
ran
his
hand
down
its
legs
he
repeated
the
process
with
the
second
and
with
so
much
investigation
he
was
content
no
that
ever
wogan
had
seen
had
such
a
smooth
sleek
skin
or
such
fine
legs
as
had
those
two
over
which
he
had
passed
his
hands
now
where
are
the
masters
of
those
horses
he
asked
himself
why
do
they
leave
their
cattle
at
this
inn
and
not
show
themselves
in
the
kitchen
or
the
courtyard
why
do
they
not
ask
for
a
couple
of
my
rooms
wogan
stood
in
the
dark
and
reflected
then
he
stepped
out
of
the
door
with
even
more
caution
than
he
had
used
when
entering
by
it
he
stole
silently
along
to
the
shed
where
his
trap
was
housed
and
felt
beneath
the
seat
from
beneath
the
seat
he
drew
out
a
coil
of
rope
and
a
lamp
the
rope
he
wound
about
him
under
his
coat
then
he
went
back
to
his
staircase
and
the
parlour
clementina
could
read
in
his
face
that
something
was
amiss
but
she
had
a
great
gift
of
silence
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
wogan
unwound
the
coil
of
rope
from
his
body
your
highness
laughed
at
me
for
that
i
would
not
part
with
my
rope
i
have
a
fear
this
night
will
prove
my
wisdom
and
with
that
he
began
deliberately
to
break
up
the
chairs
in
the
room
clementina
asked
no
questions
she
watched
him
take
the
rungs
and
bars
of
the
chairs
and
test
their
strength
then
he
cut
the
coil
of
rope
in
half
and
tied
loops
at
intervals
into
the
loops
he
fitted
the
wooden
rungs
wogan
worked
expeditiously
for
an
hour
without
opening
his
mouth
in
an
hour
he
had
fashioned
a
he
went
to
the
window
which
looked
out
on
the
back
of
the
wing
upon
the
little
thicket
of
he
opened
the
window
cautiously
and
dropped
the
ladder
down
the
wall
your
highness
has
courage
said
he
the
ladder
does
not
touch
the
ground
but
it
will
not
be
far
to
drop
should
there
be
need
the
window
of
clementina
bedroom
was
next
to
that
of
the
parlour
and
looked
out
in
the
same
direction
wogan
fixed
the
securely
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
drew
the
bed
close
to
the
window
he
left
the
lamp
upon
a
chair
and
went
back
to
the
parlour
and
explained
your
highness
he
added
there
may
be
no
cause
for
any
alarm
on
the
other
hand
the
governor
of
trent
may
have
taken
a
leaf
from
my
own
book
he
may
have
it
in
mind
to
snatch
your
highness
out
of
italy
even
as
i
did
out
of
austria
and
of
a
truth
it
would
be
the
easier
undertaking
here
are
we
five
miles
from
the
border
and
in
a
small
tavern
set
apart
from
a
small
village
instead
of
in
the
thick
of
an
armed
town
but
we
might
start
now
she
said
we
might
leave
a
message
behind
for
misset
and
wait
for
her
in
verona
i
had
thought
of
that
but
if
my
mere
suspicion
is
the
truth
the
six
men
will
not
be
so
far
from
their
six
horses
that
we
could
drive
away
unnoticed
by
any
one
of
them
nor
could
we
hope
to
outpace
them
and
six
men
upon
an
open
road
indeed
i
would
sooner
face
them
at
the
head
of
my
staircase
here
and
while
i
hold
them
back
your
highness
can
creep
down
that
ladder
and
hide
in
the
thicket
she
interrupted
yet
yet
that
leaves
you
alone
i
could
give
you
some
help
and
her
face
coloured
you
were
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
i
had
courage
i
could
at
the
least
load
your
pistols
you
would
do
that
cried
wogan
aye
but
you
would
you
would
for
the
first
time
that
day
he
forgot
to
address
her
with
the
ceremony
of
her
title
all
that
day
he
had
schooled
his
tongue
to
the
use
of
it
they
were
not
man
and
woman
though
his
heart
would
have
it
so
they
were
princess
and
servant
and
every
minute
he
must
remember
it
but
he
forgot
it
now
delicate
she
was
to
look
upon
as
any
princess
who
had
ever
adorned
a
court
delicate
and
fresh
and
young
but
here
was
the
rare
woman
flashing
out
like
a
light
over
stormy
seas
the
spirit
of
her
and
her
courage
you
would
load
my
pistols
he
repeated
his
whole
face
alight
to
be
sure
you
would
do
that
but
i
ask
you
i
think
for
a
higher
courage
i
ask
you
to
climb
down
that
ladder
to
run
alone
taking
shelter
when
there
need
back
to
that
narrow
gorge
we
saw
where
the
path
leads
upwards
to
the
bluff
there
was
a
hut
two
hours
would
take
you
to
it
and
there
you
should
be
safe
i
will
keep
the
enemy
back
till
you
are
gone
if
i
can
when
all
is
over
here
i
follow
you
if
i
do
not
come
why
you
must
ah
but
you
will
come
said
she
with
a
smile
i
have
no
fears
but
that
you
will
come
and
she
added
else
would
you
never
persuade
me
to
go
well
then
i
will
come
at
all
events
captain
misset
and
his
wife
will
surely
come
down
the
road
if
i
rap
twice
upon
your
door
you
will
take
that
for
my
signal
but
it
is
very
likely
i
shall
not
rap
at
all
wogan
shivered
as
he
spoke
it
was
not
for
the
first
time
during
that
conversation
and
a
little
later
as
they
stood
together
in
the
passage
by
the
clementina
twice
remarked
that
he
shivered
again
there
was
an
oil
lamp
burning
against
the
passage
wall
and
by
its
light
she
could
see
that
on
that
warm
night
of
spring
his
face
was
pinched
with
cold
he
was
in
truth
chilled
to
the
bone
through
lack
of
sleep
his
eyes
had
the
strained
look
of
a
man
strung
to
the
breaking
point
and
at
the
sight
of
him
the
mother
in
her
was
touched
what
if
i
watched
she
said
what
if
you
slept
wogan
laughed
the
suggestion
aside
i
shall
sleep
very
well
said
he
upon
that
top
stair
i
can
count
upon
waking
though
only
the
lowest
step
tremble
beneath
a
foot
this
he
said
meaning
not
to
sleep
at
all
as
clementina
very
well
understood
she
leaned
over
the
balustrade
by
wogan
side
and
looked
upwards
to
the
sky
the
night
was
about
them
like
a
perfume
of
flowers
a
stream
bubbled
and
sang
over
stones
behind
the
inn
the
courtyard
below
was
very
silent
she
laid
a
hand
upon
his
sleeve
and
said
again
in
a
pleading
voice
let
me
watch
there
is
no
danger
you
are
racked
by
sleeplessness
and
phantoms
born
of
it
wear
the
face
of
truth
to
you
we
are
safe
we
are
in
italy
the
stars
tell
me
so
let
me
watch
and
at
once
she
was
startled
he
withdrew
his
arm
so
roughly
that
it
seemed
he
flung
off
his
hand
he
spoke
in
a
voice
so
hoarse
and
rough
she
did
not
know
it
for
his
and
indeed
it
was
a
different
man
who
now
confronted
her
a
man
different
from
the
dutiful
servant
who
had
rescued
her
different
even
from
the
man
who
had
held
her
so
tenderly
in
his
arms
on
the
road
to
go
to
your
room
said
he
you
must
not
stay
here
she
stepped
back
in
her
surprise
and
faced
him
every
minute
he
cried
in
a
sort
of
exasperation
i
bid
myself
remember
the
great
gulf
between
you
and
me
every
minute
you
forget
it
i
make
a
curtain
of
your
rank
your
title
and
let
us
be
frank
your
destiny
i
hang
the
curtain
up
between
us
and
with
a
gentle
hand
you
tear
it
down
at
the
end
of
it
all
i
am
flesh
and
blood
why
did
i
sit
the
whole
long
dreary
day
out
on
the
bank
by
the
roadside
there
to
watch
i
could
not
describe
to
you
one
traveller
out
of
them
all
who
passed
why
then
ask
yourself
it
was
not
that
i
might
stand
by
your
side
afterwards
in
the
glamour
of
an
italian
night
with
the
stars
pulsing
overhead
like
a
smile
upon
your
lips
and
all
the
world
whispering
you
must
not
stay
here
his
eyes
burnt
upon
her
his
hands
shook
from
head
to
foot
he
was
hot
and
fierce
with
passion
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
kindled
to
it
that
he
loved
she
knew
before
but
his
description
of
his
city
of
dreams
had
given
to
him
in
her
thoughts
a
touch
of
fancifulness
had
led
her
to
conceive
of
his
love
as
something
dreamlike
had
somehow
spiritualised
him
to
the
hindrance
of
her
grasp
of
him
as
flesh
and
blood
thus
she
understood
she
might
well
have
seemed
to
be
trifling
with
him
though
nothing
was
further
from
her
thoughts
but
now
he
was
dangerous
love
had
made
him
dangerous
and
to
her
she
knew
it
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
gloried
in
the
knowledge
her
heart
leaped
into
her
eyes
and
shone
there
responsive
unafraid
the
next
moment
she
lowered
her
head
but
he
had
seen
the
unmistakable
look
in
her
eyes
even
as
she
stood
with
her
bowed
head
he
could
not
but
feel
that
every
fibre
in
her
body
thrilled
he
could
not
but
know
the
transfigured
expression
of
her
face
i
had
no
thought
to
hurt
you
she
said
and
her
voice
trembled
and
it
was
not
with
fear
or
any
pain
wogan
took
a
step
towards
her
and
checked
himself
he
spoke
sharply
between
clenched
teeth
lock
your
door
said
he
the
curtain
between
them
was
down
wogan
had
patched
and
patched
it
before
but
it
was
torn
down
now
and
they
had
seen
each
other
without
so
much
as
that
patched
semblance
of
a
screen
to
veil
their
eyes
clementina
did
not
answer
him
or
raise
her
head
she
went
quietly
into
her
room
wogan
did
not
move
until
she
had
locked
the
door
then
he
disposed
himself
for
the
night
he
sat
down
across
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
with
his
back
propped
against
the
passage
wall
facing
him
was
the
door
of
clementina
room
on
his
left
hand
the
passage
with
the
oil
lamp
burning
on
a
bracket
stretched
to
the
on
his
right
the
stairs
descended
straight
for
some
steps
then
turned
to
the
left
and
ran
down
still
within
view
to
a
point
where
again
they
turned
outwards
into
the
courtyard
wogan
saw
to
the
priming
of
his
pistols
and
laid
them
beside
him
he
looked
out
to
his
right
over
the
buildings
opposite
and
saw
the
black
mountains
with
their
glimmering
crests
and
just
above
one
spur
a
star
which
flashed
with
a
particular
brightness
he
was
very
tired
and
very
cold
he
drew
his
cloak
about
him
he
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
watched
that
star
so
long
as
he
saw
that
he
was
awake
and
therefore
he
watched
it
at
what
time
sleep
overtook
him
he
could
never
discover
it
seemed
to
him
always
that
he
did
not
even
for
a
second
lose
sight
of
that
star
only
it
dilated
it
grew
brighter
it
dropped
towards
earth
and
he
was
not
in
any
way
surprised
he
was
merely
pleased
with
it
for
behaving
in
so
attractive
and
natural
a
way
then
however
the
strange
thing
happened
when
the
star
was
hung
in
the
air
between
earth
and
sky
and
nearer
to
the
earth
it
opened
like
a
flower
and
disclosed
in
its
bright
heart
the
face
of
a
girl
which
was
yet
brighter
and
that
girl
face
with
the
broad
low
brows
and
the
dark
eyes
and
the
smile
which
held
all
earth
and
much
of
heaven
stooped
and
stooped
out
of
fire
through
the
cool
dark
towards
him
until
her
lips
touched
his
it
was
then
that
he
woke
quietly
as
was
his
wont
without
any
start
without
opening
his
eyes
and
at
once
he
was
aware
of
someone
breathing
he
raised
his
eyelids
imperceptibly
and
peered
through
his
eyelashes
he
saw
close
beside
him
the
lower
part
of
a
woman
frock
and
it
was
the
frock
which
clementina
wore
one
wild
question
set
his
heart
leaping
within
his
breast
was
there
truth
in
the
dream
he
asked
himself
and
while
he
was
yet
formulating
the
question
clementina
breathing
was
suddenly
arrested
it
seemed
to
him
too
from
the
little
that
he
saw
between
his
closed
eyes
that
she
stiffened
from
head
to
foot
she
stood
in
that
rigid
attitude
very
still
something
new
had
plainly
occurred
something
that
brought
with
it
a
shock
of
surprise
wogan
without
moving
his
head
or
opening
his
eyes
a
fraction
wider
looked
down
the
staircase
and
saw
just
above
the
edge
of
one
of
the
steep
stairs
a
face
watching
them
a
face
with
bright
birdlike
eyes
and
an
indescribable
expression
of
cunning
wogan
had
need
of
all
his
he
felt
that
his
eyelids
were
fluttering
on
his
cheeks
that
his
breath
had
stopped
even
as
clementina
had
for
the
face
which
he
saw
was
one
quite
familiar
to
him
though
never
familiar
with
that
expression
it
was
the
face
of
an
gentleman
who
made
up
for
the
lack
of
his
wit
by
the
heartiness
of
his
laugh
and
to
whom
wogan
had
been
drawn
because
of
his
simplicity
there
was
no
simplicity
in
henry
whittington
face
now
it
remained
above
the
edge
of
the
step
staring
at
them
with
a
look
of
crafty
triumph
a
very
image
of
intrigue
then
it
disappeared
silently
wogan
remembered
the
voice
of
the
man
who
had
spurred
past
the
doorway
of
the
inn
at
ala
he
knew
now
why
he
had
thought
to
recognise
it
the
exclamation
had
been
one
of
anger
because
he
had
seen
clementina
and
himself
in
italy
he
had
spurred
onwards
towards
trent
there
were
those
six
horses
in
the
stables
whittington
face
had
disappeared
very
silently
an
honest
man
thought
wogan
does
not
take
off
his
boots
before
he
mounts
the
stairs
clementina
was
still
standing
at
his
side
without
changing
his
attitude
he
rapped
with
his
knuckles
gently
twice
upon
the
boards
of
the
stair
she
turned
towards
him
with
a
gasp
of
the
breath
he
rapped
again
twice
fearful
lest
she
should
speak
to
him
she
understood
that
he
had
given
her
the
signal
to
go
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
slipped
back
into
her
room
chapter
xix
wogan
did
not
move
in
a
few
minutes
he
heard
voices
whispering
in
the
courtyard
below
by
that
time
the
princess
should
have
escaped
into
the
thicket
the
stairs
creaked
and
again
he
saw
a
face
over
the
edge
of
a
step
it
was
the
flabby
face
of
a
stranger
who
turned
and
whispered
in
german
to
others
behind
him
the
face
rose
a
pair
of
shoulders
a
portly
body
and
a
pair
of
unbooted
legs
became
visible
the
man
carried
a
drawn
sword
between
his
closed
eyelashes
wogan
saw
that
four
others
with
the
like
arms
followed
there
should
have
been
six
but
the
sixth
was
harry
whittington
who
to
be
sure
was
not
likely
to
show
himself
to
wogan
awake
the
five
men
passed
the
first
turn
of
the
stairs
without
noise
wogan
was
very
well
pleased
with
their
noiselessness
men
without
boots
to
their
feet
were
at
a
very
great
disadvantage
when
it
came
to
a
fight
he
allowed
them
to
come
up
to
the
second
turn
he
allowed
the
leader
to
ascend
the
last
straight
flight
until
he
was
almost
within
and
then
he
quietly
rose
to
his
feet
gentlemen
said
he
i
grieve
to
disappoint
you
but
i
have
hired
this
lodging
for
the
night
the
leader
stopped
discountenanced
and
leaned
back
against
his
followers
you
are
awake
he
stammered
it
is
a
habit
of
mine
the
leader
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
assumed
an
appearance
of
dignity
then
we
are
saved
some
loss
of
time
for
we
were
coming
to
awake
you
it
was
on
that
account
no
doubt
said
wogan
folding
his
arms
that
you
have
all
taken
off
your
boots
but
pardon
me
your
four
friends
behind
appear
in
spite
of
what
i
have
said
to
be
thrusting
you
forward
i
beg
you
to
remain
on
the
step
on
which
you
stand
for
if
you
mount
one
more
you
will
put
me
to
the
inconvenience
of
drawing
my
sword
wogan
leaned
back
idly
against
the
wall
the
princess
should
now
be
on
the
road
and
past
the
inn
unless
perhaps
whittington
was
at
watch
beneath
the
windows
that
did
not
seem
likely
however
whittington
would
work
in
the
dark
and
not
risk
detection
the
leader
of
the
four
had
stepped
back
at
wogan
words
but
he
said
very
bravely
i
warn
you
to
use
no
violence
to
officers
in
discharge
of
their
duty
we
hold
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
indeed
said
wogan
with
a
great
show
of
surprise
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
it
on
what
counts
firstly
in
that
you
stole
away
her
highness
the
princess
clementina
from
the
emperor
guardianship
on
the
night
of
the
of
april
at
innspruck
did
i
indeed
do
that
said
wogan
carelessly
upon
my
word
this
cloak
of
mine
is
frayed
i
had
not
noticed
it
and
he
picked
at
the
fringe
of
his
cloak
with
some
annoyance
in
the
second
place
you
did
kill
and
put
to
death
at
a
wayside
inn
outside
stuttgart
one
anton
gans
servant
to
the
countess
of
berg
wogan
smiled
amicably
i
should
be
given
a
medal
for
that
with
a
most
beautiful
ribbon
of
salmon
colour
i
fancy
salmon
or
aquamarine
which
would
look
best
do
you
think
on
a
coat
of
black
velvet
i
wear
black
velvet
as
your
relations
will
too
my
friend
if
you
forget
which
step
your
foot
is
on
shall
we
say
salmon
colour
for
the
ribbon
the
servant
was
a
noxious
fellow
we
will
the
leader
of
the
four
who
had
set
his
foot
on
the
forbidden
step
withdrew
it
quickly
wogan
continued
in
the
same
quiet
voice
you
say
you
have
a
warrant
and
a
voice
very
different
from
his
leader
a
voice
loud
and
decisive
which
came
from
the
last
of
the
four
answered
him
we
have
the
emperor
warrant
and
how
comes
it
asked
wogan
that
the
emperor
warrant
runs
in
venice
because
the
emperor
arm
strikes
in
venice
cried
the
hindermost
again
and
he
pushed
past
the
man
in
front
of
him
that
we
have
yet
to
see
cried
wogan
and
his
sword
flashed
naked
in
his
hand
at
the
same
moment
the
man
who
had
spoken
drew
a
pistol
and
fired
he
fired
in
a
hurry
the
bullet
cut
a
groove
in
the
rail
of
the
stair
and
flattened
itself
against
the
passage
wall
the
emperor
arm
shakes
it
seems
said
wogan
with
a
laugh
the
leader
of
the
party
thrust
forward
by
those
behind
him
was
lifted
to
the
forbidden
step
i
warned
you
cried
wogan
and
his
sword
darted
out
but
whether
from
design
or
accident
the
man
uttered
a
cry
and
stumbled
forward
on
his
face
wogan
sword
flashed
over
his
shoulder
and
its
point
sank
into
the
throat
of
the
soldier
behind
him
that
second
soldier
fell
back
with
the
blood
spurting
from
his
wound
upon
the
man
with
the
smoking
pistol
who
thrust
him
aside
with
an
oath
make
room
he
cried
and
lunged
over
the
fallen
leader
here
a
fellow
in
the
most
desperate
hurry
said
wogan
and
parrying
the
thrust
he
disengaged
circled
disengaged
again
and
lunging
felt
the
soldier
leather
coat
yield
to
his
point
the
emperor
arm
is
weak
too
one
might
believe
he
laughed
and
he
drove
his
sword
home
the
man
fell
upon
the
stairs
but
as
wogan
spoke
the
leader
crouched
on
the
step
plucked
violently
at
his
cloak
below
his
knees
wogan
had
not
recovered
from
his
lunge
the
jerk
at
the
cloak
threw
him
off
his
balance
his
legs
slipped
forward
under
him
in
another
moment
he
would
have
come
crashing
down
the
stairs
upon
his
back
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
there
stood
one
man
absolutely
unharmed
supporting
his
comrade
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
throat
wogan
felt
the
jerk
understood
the
danger
and
saw
its
remedy
at
the
same
instant
he
did
not
resist
the
impetus
he
threw
his
body
into
it
he
sprang
from
the
stairs
forwards
tearing
his
cloak
from
the
leader
hands
he
sprang
across
the
leader
across
the
soldier
who
had
fired
at
him
and
he
dropped
with
all
his
weight
into
the
arms
of
the
third
man
with
the
pierced
throat
the
blood
poured
out
from
the
wound
over
wogan
face
and
breast
in
a
blinding
jet
the
fellow
uttered
one
choking
cry
and
reeling
back
carried
the
comrade
who
supported
him
against
the
balustrade
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
wogan
did
not
give
that
fourth
man
time
to
disengage
himself
but
dropping
his
sword
caught
him
by
the
throat
as
the
third
wounded
man
slipped
between
them
to
the
ground
wogan
bent
his
new
opponent
backwards
over
the
balustrade
and
felt
the
muscles
of
his
back
resist
and
then
slacken
wogan
bent
him
further
and
further
over
until
it
seemed
his
back
must
break
but
it
was
the
balustrade
which
broke
wogan
heard
it
crack
he
had
just
time
to
loose
his
hands
and
step
back
and
the
railing
and
the
man
poised
on
the
rail
fell
outwards
into
the
courtyard
wogan
stepped
forward
and
peered
downwards
the
soldier
had
not
broken
his
neck
for
wogan
saw
him
writhe
upon
the
ground
he
bent
his
head
to
see
the
better
he
heard
a
report
behind
him
and
a
bullet
passed
through
the
crown
of
his
hat
he
swung
round
and
saw
the
leader
of
the
four
with
one
of
his
own
pistols
smoking
in
his
hand
you
cried
wogan
sure
here
a
rabbit
attacking
a
terrier
dog
and
he
sprang
up
the
stairs
the
man
threw
away
the
pistol
fell
on
his
knees
and
held
up
his
hands
for
mercy
now
what
will
i
do
to
you
said
wogan
did
you
not
fire
at
my
back
that
reprehensible
cowardice
and
with
my
own
pistol
too
which
is
sheer
impertinence
what
will
i
do
with
you
the
man
expression
was
so
pitiable
his
heavy
cheeks
hung
in
such
despairing
folds
that
wogan
was
stirred
to
laughter
well
you
have
put
me
to
a
deal
of
inconvenience
said
he
but
i
will
be
merciful
being
strong
being
most
extraordinary
strong
i
send
you
back
to
your
master
the
emperor
with
a
message
from
me
that
four
men
are
no
manner
of
use
at
all
come
in
here
for
a
bit
wogan
took
the
unfortunate
man
and
led
him
into
the
parlour
then
he
lit
a
lamp
and
making
his
captive
sit
where
he
could
see
any
movement
that
he
made
he
wrote
a
very
polite
note
to
his
most
catholic
majesty
the
emperor
wherein
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
a
cruel
thing
to
send
four
poor
men
who
had
never
done
harm
to
capture
charles
wogan
that
no
king
or
emperor
before
who
had
wanted
to
capture
charles
wogan
of
whom
there
were
already
many
and
by
god
grace
he
hoped
there
would
be
more
had
ever
despatched
less
than
a
regiment
of
horse
upon
so
hazardous
an
expedition
and
that
when
captain
might
be
expected
to
be
standing
side
by
side
with
wogan
it
was
usually
thought
necessary
to
add
seven
batteries
of
artillery
and
a
field
marshal
wogan
thereupon
went
on
to
point
out
that
peri
was
in
venetian
territory
which
his
most
catholic
majesty
had
violated
and
that
charles
wogan
would
accordingly
feel
it
his
bounden
duty
not
to
sleep
night
or
day
until
he
had
made
a
confederation
of
italian
states
to
declare
war
and
captivity
upon
his
most
catholic
majesty
wogan
concluded
with
the
assurances
of
his
profoundest
respects
and
was
much
pleased
by
his
letter
which
he
sealed
and
compelled
his
prisoner
upon
his
knees
to
promise
to
deliver
into
the
emperor
own
hands
now
where
is
that
pretty
warrant
said
wogan
as
soon
as
this
important
function
was
accomplished
it
is
signed
by
the
governor
of
trent
said
the
man
who
in
those
regions
is
the
emperor
deputy
hand
it
over
the
man
handed
it
over
reluctantly
now
continued
wogan
here
is
paper
and
ink
and
a
chair
sit
down
and
write
a
full
confession
of
your
audacious
incursion
into
a
friendly
country
and
just
write
if
you
please
how
much
you
paid
the
landlady
to
hear
nothing
of
what
was
doing
you
will
not
force
me
to
that
cried
the
fellow
by
no
means
the
confession
must
be
voluntary
and
written
of
your
own
free
will
so
write
it
my
friend
without
any
compulsion
whatever
or
i
throw
you
out
of
the
window
then
followed
a
deal
of
sighing
and
muttering
but
the
confession
was
written
and
handed
to
wogan
who
glanced
over
it
but
there
an
omission
said
he
you
make
mention
of
only
five
men
there
were
only
five
men
on
the
staircase
but
there
are
six
horses
in
the
stables
will
you
be
good
enough
to
write
down
at
what
hour
on
what
day
harry
whittington
knocked
at
the
governor
door
in
trent
and
told
the
poor
man
that
the
princess
and
wogan
had
put
up
at
the
cervo
inn
at
the
soldier
turned
a
startled
face
on
wogan
so
you
knew
he
cried
oh
i
knew
answered
wogan
suddenly
look
at
me
did
you
ever
see
eyes
so
heavy
with
want
of
sleep
a
face
so
worn
by
it
a
body
so
jerked
upon
strings
like
a
showman
puppet
write
i
tell
you
we
who
serve
the
king
are
trained
to
wakefulness
write
i
am
in
haste
yet
your
king
does
not
reign
said
the
man
wonderingly
and
he
wrote
he
wrote
the
truth
about
harry
whittington
for
wogan
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
did
he
pay
you
to
keep
silence
as
to
his
share
in
the
business
asked
wogan
as
the
man
scattered
some
sand
over
the
paper
there
is
no
word
of
it
in
your
handwriting
the
man
added
a
sentence
and
a
figure
that
will
do
said
wogan
i
may
need
it
for
a
particular
purpose
and
he
put
the
letter
carefully
away
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
for
a
very
particular
purpose
he
added
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
convey
your
party
back
with
all
haste
to
trent
you
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
border
chapter
xx
wogan
went
from
the
parlour
and
climbed
out
of
the
house
by
the
he
left
it
hanging
at
the
window
and
walked
up
the
glimmering
road
a
ribbon
of
ghostly
white
between
dim
hills
it
was
then
about
twelve
of
the
night
and
not
a
feather
of
cloud
stained
the
perfection
of
the
sky
it
curved
above
his
head
spangled
like
a
fair
lady
fan
and
unfathomably
blue
like
clementina
eyes
when
her
heart
stirred
in
their
depths
he
reached
the
little
footway
and
turned
into
the
upward
cleft
of
the
hills
he
walked
now
into
the
thick
night
of
a
clump
of
which
weaved
so
dense
a
thatch
above
his
head
that
he
knocked
against
the
boles
the
trees
thinned
he
crossed
here
and
there
a
dimpled
lawn
in
the
pure
starshine
he
traversed
a
sparse
grove
of
larches
in
the
dreamy
twilight
he
came
out
again
upon
the
grassy
lip
of
a
mountain
torrent
which
henceforth
kept
him
company
and
which
speaking
with
many
voices
seemed
a
friend
trying
to
catch
his
mood
for
here
it
leaped
over
an
edge
of
rock
and
here
in
a
tiny
waterfall
and
splashed
into
a
pellucid
pool
and
the
reverberating
noise
filled
the
dell
with
a
majestic
din
there
it
ran
smoothly
kissing
its
banks
with
a
murmur
of
contentment
embosoming
the
stars
beyond
it
chafed
hoarsely
between
narrow
walls
and
again
half
a
mile
higher
up
it
sang
on
shallows
and
evaded
the
stones
with
a
tinkling
laugh
but
wogan
was
deaf
to
the
voices
he
mounted
higher
the
trees
ceased
he
came
into
a
desolate
country
of
boulders
and
the
higher
he
ascended
the
more
heavily
he
walked
he
stopped
and
washed
his
face
and
hands
clean
of
in
the
stream
above
him
and
not
very
far
away
was
the
lonely
hut
he
came
upon
it
quite
suddenly
for
the
path
climbed
steeply
at
the
back
and
slipping
from
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
gully
he
stood
upon
the
edge
of
a
small
plateau
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
the
cabin
a
little
house
of
pinewood
built
with
some
decoration
and
elegance
one
unglazed
window
was
now
unshuttered
and
the
light
from
a
lantern
streamed
out
of
it
in
a
yellow
fan
marking
the
segment
of
a
circle
upon
the
rough
rocky
ground
and
giving
to
the
dusk
of
the
starshine
a
sparkle
of
gold
through
the
window
wogan
could
see
into
the
room
it
was
furnished
simply
but
with
an
eye
to
comfort
he
saw
too
the
girl
he
had
dared
to
bear
off
from
the
thick
of
a
hostile
town
she
was
lying
upon
a
couch
her
head
resting
upon
her
folded
arms
she
was
asleep
and
in
a
place
most
solitary
behind
the
cabin
rose
a
black
forest
of
pines
pricking
the
sky
with
their
black
spires
and
in
front
of
it
the
ground
fell
sharply
to
the
valley
in
which
no
light
gleamed
beyond
the
valley
rose
the
dim
hills
again
nor
was
there
any
sound
except
the
torrent
the
air
at
this
height
was
keen
and
fresh
with
a
smell
of
primeval
earth
wogan
hitched
his
cloak
about
his
throat
and
his
boots
rang
upon
the
rock
the
princess
raised
her
head
wogan
walked
to
the
door
and
stood
for
a
little
with
his
hand
upon
the
latch
he
lifted
it
and
entered
clementina
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
curiously
she
had
no
questions
as
to
how
his
struggle
with
the
governor
of
trent
emissaries
had
fared
wogan
could
understand
by
some
unspoken
sympathy
that
that
matter
had
no
place
in
her
thoughts
she
stood
up
in
an
attitude
of
expectation
it
grows
towards
morning
said
she
in
two
hours
we
shall
have
the
dawn
he
replied
and
there
was
a
silence
between
them
you
found
this
cabin
open
said
wogan
the
door
was
latched
i
loosed
a
shutter
the
night
is
very
still
one
might
fancy
there
were
no
others
alive
but
you
and
me
across
all
the
width
of
the
world
one
could
wish
it
she
said
beneath
her
breath
and
crossed
to
the
window
where
she
stayed
breathing
the
fresh
night
the
sigh
however
had
reached
to
wogan
ears
he
took
his
pistols
from
his
belt
and
to
engage
his
thoughts
loaded
the
one
which
had
been
fired
at
him
after
a
little
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
clementina
eyes
dwelt
upon
him
with
that
dark
steady
look
which
held
always
so
much
of
mystery
and
told
always
one
thing
plainly
her
lack
of
fear
and
she
said
suddenly
there
was
trouble
at
peri
i
climbed
from
the
window
i
had
almost
forgotten
as
i
ran
down
the
road
past
the
open
court
i
saw
a
little
group
of
men
gathered
about
the
foot
of
the
staircase
i
was
in
two
minds
whether
to
come
back
and
load
your
pistols
or
to
obey
you
i
obeyed
but
i
was
in
much
fear
for
you
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
seems
so
long
ago
tell
me
you
conquered
it
is
no
new
thing
tell
me
how
she
did
not
move
from
the
window
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
wogan
while
he
told
his
story
but
it
was
quite
clear
to
him
that
she
did
not
hear
one
half
of
it
and
when
he
had
done
she
said
how
long
is
it
till
the
morning
wogan
had
spun
his
tale
out
but
half
an
hour
enclosed
it
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
he
became
silent
again
but
he
was
aware
at
once
that
silence
was
more
dangerous
than
speech
for
in
the
silence
he
could
hear
both
their
hearts
speaking
he
began
hurriedly
to
talk
of
their
journey
and
there
could
be
no
more
insidious
topic
for
him
to
light
upon
for
he
spoke
of
the
road
and
he
had
already
been
given
a
warning
that
to
the
romance
of
the
road
her
heart
turned
like
a
to
the
north
they
were
both
gipsies
for
all
that
they
had
no
egyptian
blood
that
southward
road
from
innspruck
was
much
more
than
a
mere
highway
of
travel
between
a
and
a
goal
even
to
these
two
to
whom
the
meant
peril
and
the
goal
the
first
opportunity
of
sleep
even
in
our
short
journey
said
clementina
how
it
climbed
hillsides
angle
upon
angle
how
it
swept
through
the
high
solitudes
of
ice
where
no
trees
grow
where
silence
lives
how
it
dropped
down
into
green
valleys
and
the
noise
of
streams
and
it
still
sweeps
on
through
dark
and
light
a
glimmer
at
night
a
glare
in
the
midday
between
lines
of
poplars
hidden
amongst
vines
through
lighted
cities
down
to
venice
and
the
sea
if
one
could
travel
it
never
retracing
a
step
pitching
a
tent
by
the
roadside
when
one
willed
that
were
freedom
she
stopped
with
a
remarkable
abruptness
she
turned
her
eyes
out
of
the
window
for
a
little
then
again
she
asked
how
long
till
morning
but
one
more
hour
she
came
back
into
the
room
and
seated
herself
at
the
table
you
gave
me
some
hint
at
innspruck
of
an
adventurous
ride
from
ohlau
and
she
drew
her
breath
sharply
at
the
word
as
though
the
name
with
all
its
associations
struck
her
a
blow
into
strasbourg
tell
me
its
history
so
will
this
hour
pass
he
told
her
as
he
walked
about
the
room
though
his
heart
was
not
in
the
telling
nor
hers
in
the
hearing
until
he
came
to
relate
the
story
of
his
escape
from
the
inn
a
mile
or
so
beyond
stuttgart
he
described
how
he
hid
in
the
garden
how
he
crossed
the
rich
level
of
lawn
to
the
lighted
window
how
to
his
surprise
he
was
admitted
without
a
question
by
an
old
bookish
gentleman
and
thereupon
he
ceased
so
suddenly
that
clementina
turned
her
head
aside
and
listened
did
you
hear
a
step
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
no
and
they
both
listened
no
noise
came
to
their
ears
but
the
brawling
of
the
torrent
that
however
filled
the
room
drowning
all
the
natural
murmurs
of
the
night
indeed
one
would
not
hear
a
company
of
soldiers
said
clementina
she
crossed
to
the
window
yet
you
heard
my
step
and
it
waked
you
said
wogan
as
he
followed
her
i
listened
for
it
in
my
sleep
said
she
for
a
second
time
that
night
they
stood
side
by
side
looking
upon
darkness
and
the
spangled
sky
only
there
was
no
courtyard
with
its
signs
of
habitation
clementina
drew
herself
away
suddenly
from
the
sill
wogan
at
once
copied
her
example
you
saw
he
began
no
one
said
she
bending
her
dark
eyes
full
upon
him
will
you
close
the
shutter
wogan
drew
back
instinctively
he
had
a
sense
that
this
open
window
though
there
was
no
one
to
spy
through
it
was
in
some
way
a
security
suppose
that
he
closed
it
that
mere
act
of
shutting
himself
and
her
apart
though
it
gave
not
one
atom
more
of
privacy
still
had
a
semblance
of
giving
it
he
was
afraid
he
said
there
is
no
need
who
should
spy
on
us
what
would
it
matter
if
we
were
spied
upon
i
ask
you
to
close
that
shutter
from
the
quiet
level
voice
he
could
infer
nothing
of
the
thought
behind
the
request
and
her
unwavering
eyes
told
him
nothing
why
because
i
am
afraid
as
you
are
said
she
and
she
shivered
you
would
not
have
it
shut
i
am
afraid
while
it
stays
open
there
is
too
much
expectation
in
the
night
those
great
black
pines
stand
waiting
the
stars
are
very
bright
and
still
they
wait
holding
their
breath
it
seems
to
me
the
whirl
of
the
earth
has
stopped
never
was
there
a
night
so
hushed
in
expectation
and
these
words
too
she
spoke
without
a
falter
or
a
lifting
note
breathing
easily
like
a
child
asleep
and
not
changing
her
direct
gaze
from
wogan
face
i
am
afraid
she
continued
of
you
and
me
i
am
the
more
afraid
and
wogan
set
the
shutter
in
its
place
and
let
the
bar
fall
clementina
with
a
breath
of
relief
came
back
to
her
seat
at
the
table
how
long
is
it
till
dawn
she
said
we
have
half
an
hour
said
wogan
well
that
old
man
count
von
ahlen
you
said
received
you
heaped
logs
upon
his
fire
stanched
your
wounds
and
asked
no
questions
well
you
stopped
suddenly
tell
me
all
wogan
looked
doubtfully
at
her
and
then
quickly
seated
himself
over
against
her
all
i
will
it
will
be
no
new
thing
to
you
and
as
clementina
raised
her
eyes
curiously
to
his
he
met
her
gaze
and
so
spoke
the
rest
looking
at
her
with
her
own
direct
gaze
why
did
he
ask
no
question
seeing
me
disordered
wounded
a
bandit
for
all
he
knew
with
a
murder
on
my
hands
because
thirty
years
before
count
philip
christopher
von
königsmarck
had
come
in
just
that
same
way
over
the
lawn
to
the
window
and
had
sat
by
that
and
charmed
the
old
gentleman
into
an
envy
by
his
incomparable
elegance
and
wit
königsmarck
exclaimed
the
girl
she
knew
the
history
of
that
brilliant
and
baleful
adventurer
at
the
court
of
hanover
he
came
as
you
did
and
wounded
the
princess
sophia
dorothea
was
visiting
the
duke
of
würtemberg
wogan
explained
and
clementina
nodded
count
otto
von
ahlen
my
host
he
continued
had
a
momentary
thought
that
i
was
königsmarck
mysteriously
returned
as
he
had
mysteriously
vanished
and
through
these
thirty
years
retention
of
his
youth
count
otto
could
never
think
of
königsmarck
but
as
a
man
young
and
tossed
in
a
froth
of
passion
he
would
have
it
to
the
end
that
i
had
escaped
from
such
venture
as
had
königsmarck
he
would
have
it
my
wounds
were
the
mere
offset
to
a
love
well
worth
them
he
envy
me
said
he
passion
there
can
be
no
great
thing
and
the
saying
lived
in
your
thoughts
cried
clementina
i
do
not
wonder
passion
there
can
be
no
great
thing
can
books
teach
a
man
so
much
nay
it
was
an
hour
talk
with
königsmarck
which
set
the
old
thoughts
that
way
and
though
königsmarck
talked
never
so
well
i
would
not
likely
infer
from
his
talk
an
eternal
and
universal
truth
count
otto
left
me
alone
while
he
fetched
me
food
and
he
left
me
in
a
panic
a
panic
said
clementina
with
a
little
laugh
you
yes
that
first
mistake
of
me
for
königsmarck
that
insistence
that
my
case
was
königsmarck
there
was
a
shadow
of
truth
in
it
even
then
said
clementina
suddenly
leaning
across
the
table
towards
him
wogan
strove
not
to
see
the
light
of
her
joy
suddenly
sparkling
in
her
eyes
i
sat
alone
feeling
the
ghost
of
königsmarck
in
the
room
with
me
he
resumed
quickly
and
his
voice
dropped
and
he
looked
round
the
little
cabin
clementina
looked
round
quickly
too
then
their
eyes
met
again
i
heard
his
voice
menacing
me
love
of
a
queen
i
lived
for
love
of
a
queen
i
died
most
horribly
and
it
would
have
gone
better
with
the
queen
had
she
died
the
same
death
at
the
same
time
and
clementina
interrupted
him
with
a
cry
which
was
fierce
ah
who
can
say
that
and
know
it
for
the
truth
except
the
queen
you
must
ask
her
in
her
prison
at
ahlden
and
that
you
can
not
do
she
has
her
memories
maybe
maybe
she
has
built
herself
within
these
thirty
years
a
world
of
thought
so
real
it
makes
her
gaolers
shadows
and
that
prison
a
place
of
no
account
save
that
it
gives
her
solitude
and
is
so
more
desirable
than
a
palace
i
can
imagine
it
and
then
she
stopped
and
her
voice
dropped
to
the
low
tone
which
wogan
had
used
you
looked
round
you
but
now
and
most
fearfully
is
spirit
here
no
exclaimed
wogan
i
would
to
god
it
were
i
would
i
felt
its
memories
chilling
me
as
they
chilled
me
that
night
but
i
can
not
i
can
not
as
much
as
hear
a
whisper
all
the
heavens
are
dumb
he
cried
and
the
earth
waits
said
clementina
she
did
not
move
neither
did
wogan
they
both
sat
still
as
statues
they
had
come
to
the
great
crisis
of
their
destiny
a
change
of
posture
a
gesture
an
assumed
expression
which
might
avert
the
small
the
merely
awkward
indiscretions
of
the
tongue
they
both
knew
to
be
futile
it
was
in
the
mind
of
each
of
them
that
somehow
without
their
participation
the
truth
would
out
that
night
for
the
dawn
was
so
long
in
coming
all
the
way
up
from
peri
said
wogan
suddenly
i
strove
to
make
real
to
myself
the
ignominy
the
odium
the
scandal
but
you
could
not
said
clementina
with
a
nod
of
comprehension
as
though
that
inability
was
a
thing
familiar
to
her
when
i
reached
the
hut
and
saw
that
fan
of
light
spreading
from
the
window
as
it
spread
over
the
lawn
beyond
stuttgart
i
remembered
otto
von
ahlen
and
his
talk
of
königsmarck
i
tried
to
hear
the
menaces
but
you
could
not
no
i
saw
you
through
the
window
he
cried
stretched
out
upon
that
couch
supple
and
young
and
sweet
i
saw
the
lamplight
on
your
hair
searching
out
the
gold
in
its
dark
brown
i
could
only
remember
how
often
i
have
at
nights
wakened
and
reached
out
my
hands
in
the
vain
dream
that
they
would
meet
in
its
thick
coils
that
i
should
feel
its
silk
curl
and
nestle
about
my
fingers
there
the
truth
out
though
it
a
familiar
truth
to
you
ever
since
i
held
you
in
my
arms
beneath
the
stars
upon
the
road
to
it
was
known
to
me
a
day
before
said
she
but
it
was
known
to
you
so
long
ago
as
that
night
in
the
garden
oh
before
then
cried
wogan
when
let
the
whole
truth
be
known
since
we
know
so
much
why
on
that
first
day
at
ohlau
in
the
great
hall
i
stood
by
the
fire
and
raised
my
head
and
our
eyes
met
i
do
remember
but
i
had
no
thought
ever
to
let
you
know
i
was
the
as
i
am
now
and
he
burst
into
a
harsh
laugh
madness
the
king
dumps
him
down
in
the
king
chair
i
had
a
thought
to
live
to
you
if
you
understand
as
a
man
writes
a
poem
to
his
mistress
to
make
my
life
the
poem
an
unsigned
poem
that
you
would
never
read
and
yet
unsigned
unread
would
make
its
creator
glad
and
fill
his
days
and
here
the
poem
and
at
that
a
great
cry
of
terror
leaped
from
clementina
lips
and
held
them
both
aghast
wogan
had
risen
from
his
seat
with
a
violent
gesture
he
had
thrown
back
his
cloak
and
his
coat
beneath
was
stained
and
dark
with
blood
clementina
stood
opposite
to
him
all
her
quiet
and
her
calmness
gone
there
was
no
longer
any
mystery
in
her
eyes
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
she
pointed
a
trembling
hand
towards
his
breast
you
are
hurt
again
for
love
of
me
you
are
hurt
it
is
not
my
wound
he
answered
it
is
blood
i
spilt
for
you
he
took
a
step
towards
her
and
in
a
second
she
was
between
his
arms
sobbing
with
all
the
violence
of
passion
which
she
had
so
long
restrained
wogan
was
wrung
by
it
that
she
should
weep
at
all
was
a
thought
strange
to
him
that
he
should
cause
the
tears
was
a
sorrow
which
tortured
him
he
touched
her
hair
with
his
lips
he
took
her
by
the
arms
and
would
have
set
her
apart
but
she
clung
to
him
hiding
her
face
and
the
sobs
shook
her
her
breast
was
strained
against
him
he
felt
the
beating
of
her
heart
a
fever
ran
through
all
his
blood
and
as
he
held
her
close
a
queer
inconsequential
thought
came
into
his
mind
it
shocked
him
and
he
suddenly
held
her
off
the
blood
upon
my
coat
is
wet
he
cried
the
odium
the
scandal
of
a
flight
which
would
make
her
name
a
byword
from
london
to
budapest
that
he
could
envisage
but
that
this
blood
upon
his
coat
should
stain
the
dress
she
wore
no
he
saw
indeed
that
the
bodice
was
smeared
a
dark
red
see
the
blood
stains
you
he
cried
why
then
i
share
it
she
answered
with
a
ringing
voice
of
pride
i
share
it
with
you
and
she
smiled
through
her
tears
and
a
glowing
blush
brightened
upon
her
face
she
stood
before
him
erect
and
beautiful
through
wogan
mind
there
tripped
a
procession
of
delicate
ladies
who
would
swoon
gracefully
at
the
sight
of
a
pricked
finger
that
john
sobieski
speaking
he
exclaimed
and
with
an
emphasis
of
despair
poland
king
but
i
was
mad
indeed
i
blame
myself
blame
she
cried
passionately
her
whole
nature
rising
in
revolt
against
the
word
are
we
to
blame
we
are
man
and
woman
who
shall
cast
the
stone
are
you
to
blame
for
that
you
love
me
who
shall
blame
you
not
i
who
thank
you
from
my
heart
am
i
to
blame
what
have
we
hearts
for
then
if
not
to
love
i
have
a
thought
it
may
be
very
wrong
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
trouble
to
think
that
i
should
be
much
more
to
blame
did
i
not
love
you
too
there
the
word
spoken
at
the
last
and
she
lowered
her
head
even
at
that
moment
her
gesture
struck
upon
wogan
as
strange
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
never
before
seen
her
drop
her
eyes
from
his
he
had
an
intuitive
fancy
that
she
would
never
do
it
but
as
a
deliberate
token
of
submission
nor
was
he
wrong
her
next
words
told
him
it
was
her
white
flag
of
surrender
i
believe
the
spoken
truth
is
best
she
said
simply
in
a
low
voice
which
ever
so
slightly
trembled
unspoken
and
yet
known
by
both
of
us
i
think
it
would
breed
thoughts
and
humours
we
are
best
without
unspoken
our
eyes
would
question
each
to
other
at
every
meeting
there
would
be
no
health
in
our
thoughts
but
here
the
truth
out
and
i
am
glad
in
whichever
way
you
find
its
consequence
she
stood
before
him
with
her
head
bent
she
made
no
movement
save
with
her
hands
which
worked
together
slowly
and
gently
in
whichever
way
i
repeated
wogan
yes
she
answered
there
is
bologna
say
that
bologna
is
our
goal
i
shall
go
with
you
to
bologna
there
is
venice
and
the
sea
bid
me
go
then
hoist
a
poor
scrap
of
a
sail
in
an
open
boat
i
shall
adventure
over
the
wide
seas
with
you
what
will
you
do
wogan
drew
a
long
breath
the
magnitude
of
the
submission
paralysed
him
the
picture
which
she
evoked
was
one
to
blind
him
as
with
a
glory
of
sunlight
he
remained
silent
for
a
while
then
he
said
timidly
there
is
ohlau
the
girl
shivered
the
name
meant
her
father
her
mother
their
grief
the
disgrace
upon
her
home
but
she
answered
only
with
her
question
what
will
you
do
you
would
lose
a
throne
he
said
and
even
while
he
spoke
was
aware
that
such
a
plea
had
not
with
her
now
the
weight
of
thistledown
you
would
become
the
mock
of
europe
you
that
are
its
wonder
and
he
saw
the
corner
of
her
lip
curve
in
a
smile
of
scorn
what
will
you
do
she
asked
and
he
ceased
to
argue
it
was
he
who
must
decide
she
willed
it
so
he
turned
towards
the
door
of
the
hut
and
opened
it
as
he
passed
through
he
heard
her
move
behind
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
that
she
leaned
down
upon
the
table
and
kissed
the
pistol
which
he
had
left
loaded
there
he
stepped
out
of
the
cabin
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
dark
blue
of
the
sky
had
faded
to
a
pure
and
pearly
colour
a
colourless
grey
light
invaded
it
the
pale
stars
were
drowning
and
all
about
him
the
trees
shivered
to
the
morning
wogan
walked
up
and
down
that
little
plateau
torn
by
indecision
inside
the
sheltered
cabin
sat
waiting
the
girl
whose
destiny
was
in
his
hands
he
had
a
sentence
to
speak
and
by
it
the
flow
of
all
her
years
would
be
irrevocably
ordered
she
had
given
herself
over
to
him
she
with
her
pride
her
courage
her
endurance
wogan
had
seen
too
closely
into
her
heart
to
bring
any
foolish
charge
of
unmaidenliness
against
her
no
the
very
completeness
of
her
submission
raised
her
to
a
higher
pinnacle
if
she
gave
herself
she
did
so
without
a
condition
or
a
reserve
body
and
bone
heart
and
soul
wogan
knew
amongst
the
women
of
his
time
many
who
made
their
bargain
with
the
world
buying
a
semblance
of
esteem
with
a
double
payment
of
lies
this
girl
stood
apart
from
them
she
loved
therefore
she
entrusted
herself
simply
to
the
man
she
loved
and
bade
him
dispose
of
her
that
very
simplicity
was
another
sign
of
her
strength
she
was
the
more
priceless
on
account
of
it
he
went
back
into
the
hut
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutter
the
morning
stretched
a
grey
finger
the
room
was
filled
with
a
vaporous
twilight
we
travel
to
bologna
said
he
i
will
not
have
you
wasted
other
women
may
slink
into
kennels
and
stop
their
ears
not
you
the
king
is
true
to
you
you
are
for
the
king
as
she
had
not
argued
before
she
did
not
argue
now
she
nodded
her
head
and
fastened
her
cloak
about
her
throat
she
followed
him
out
of
the
hut
and
down
the
gorge
in
the
northeast
the
sky
already
flamed
and
the
sun
was
up
before
they
reached
the
road
they
walked
silently
towards
peri
and
wogan
was
wondering
whether
in
her
heart
she
despised
him
when
she
stopped
i
am
to
marry
the
king
said
she
yes
said
wogan
but
you
she
said
with
her
brows
in
a
frown
there
is
no
compulsion
on
you
to
marry
anyone
wogan
was
relieved
of
his
fears
he
broke
into
a
laugh
to
which
she
made
no
reply
she
still
waited
frowning
for
his
answer
no
woman
he
said
will
ride
on
my
black
horse
into
my
city
of
dreams
you
may
be
very
sure
i
will
not
marry
no
i
would
not
have
you
married
wogan
laughed
again
but
clementina
was
very
serious
that
she
had
no
right
to
make
any
such
claim
did
not
occur
to
her
she
was
merely
certain
and
resolved
that
wogan
must
not
marry
she
did
not
again
refer
to
the
matter
nor
could
she
so
have
done
had
she
wished
for
a
little
later
and
while
they
were
not
yet
come
to
peri
they
were
hailed
from
behind
and
turning
about
they
saw
gaydon
and
riding
after
them
had
his
story
to
tell
gaydon
and
he
had
put
the
courier
to
bed
and
taken
his
clothes
and
his
money
and
after
the
fellow
had
waked
up
they
had
sat
for
a
day
in
the
bedroom
keeping
him
quiet
and
telling
the
landlord
he
was
very
finished
his
story
as
they
came
to
peri
they
went
boldly
to
the
cervo
inn
where
all
traces
of
the
conflict
had
been
removed
and
neither
wogan
nor
the
landlady
thought
it
prudent
to
make
any
mention
of
the
matter
they
waited
for
misset
and
his
wife
who
came
the
next
day
and
thus
reunited
they
passed
one
evening
into
the
streets
of
bologna
and
stopped
at
the
pilgrim
inn
chapter
xxi
in
the
parlour
of
the
pilgrim
inn
the
four
friends
took
their
leave
of
the
princess
she
could
not
part
from
them
lightly
she
spoke
with
a
faltering
voice
five
days
ago
i
was
in
prison
at
innspruck
perpetually
harassed
and
with
no
hope
of
release
but
in
you
now
i
am
in
bologna
and
free
i
could
not
believe
that
any
girl
could
find
such
friends
except
in
fairyland
you
make
the
world
very
sweet
and
clean
to
me
i
should
thank
you
see
my
tears
fall
will
you
take
them
for
my
thanks
i
have
no
words
which
can
tell
as
much
of
my
thoughts
towards
you
my
little
woman
i
keep
with
me
but
to
you
gentlemen
i
would
gladly
give
a
token
each
so
that
you
may
know
i
will
never
forget
and
so
that
you
too
may
keep
for
me
a
home
within
your
memories
to
major
gaydon
she
gave
a
ring
from
off
her
finger
to
captain
misset
a
chain
which
she
wore
about
her
neck
to
her
six
feet
four
as
she
said
between
laughter
and
tears
her
watch
each
with
a
word
of
homage
took
his
leave
clementina
spoke
to
wogan
last
of
all
and
when
the
room
was
empty
but
for
these
two
to
you
my
friend
said
she
i
give
nothing
there
is
no
need
but
i
ask
for
something
i
would
be
in
debt
to
you
still
deeper
than
i
am
i
ask
for
a
handkerchief
which
i
dropped
from
my
shoulders
one
evening
under
the
stars
upon
the
road
to
wogan
bowed
to
her
without
a
word
he
drew
the
handkerchief
from
his
breast
slowly
it
is
true
said
he
i
have
no
right
to
it
and
he
gave
it
back
but
his
voice
showed
that
he
was
hurt
you
do
not
understand
said
she
with
a
great
gentleness
you
have
every
right
which
the
truest
loyalty
can
confer
i
ask
you
for
this
handkerchief
because
i
think
at
times
to
wear
it
in
memory
of
a
white
stone
on
which
i
could
safely
set
my
foot
for
the
stone
was
not
straw
wogan
could
not
trust
his
voice
to
answer
her
he
took
her
hand
to
lift
it
to
his
lips
no
said
she
as
at
innspruck
an
honest
handclasp
if
you
please
wogan
joined
his
three
companions
in
the
road
and
they
stood
together
for
a
little
recounting
to
one
another
the
incidents
of
the
flight
here
a
great
work
ended
said
gaydon
at
last
we
shall
be
historical
said
it
is
my
one
ambition
i
want
to
figure
in
the
and
be
a
great
plague
and
nuisance
to
children
at
school
i
would
sooner
be
cursed
daily
by
schoolboys
than
have
any
number
of
golden
statues
in
galleries
it
means
the
more
solid
reputation
and
then
he
became
silent
gaydon
had
besides
his
joy
at
the
rescue
of
clementina
a
private
satisfaction
that
matters
which
were
none
of
his
business
had
had
no
uncomfortable
issue
misset
too
was
thankful
for
that
his
wife
had
come
safely
to
the
journey
end
alone
had
a
weight
upon
his
mind
and
when
gaydon
said
well
we
may
go
to
bed
and
sleep
without
alarms
till
sundown
he
remarked
there
jenny
it
was
on
my
account
she
ventured
with
us
that
true
said
wogan
but
we
shall
put
an
end
to
her
captivity
now
we
are
safe
at
bologna
i
have
friends
here
who
can
serve
me
so
far
i
have
no
doubt
was
willing
to
leave
the
matter
in
wogan
hands
if
wogan
once
pledged
himself
to
jenny
release
why
jenny
released
and
he
went
to
bed
now
with
a
quite
equable
mind
wogan
hurried
off
to
the
palace
of
the
cardinal
origo
whom
he
found
sitting
at
his
supper
the
cardinal
welcomed
wogan
back
very
warmly
i
trust
your
eminence
said
wogan
that
farini
is
now
at
bologna
you
come
in
the
nick
of
time
replied
the
cardinal
this
is
his
last
week
there
is
a
great
demand
for
the
seats
but
you
will
see
to
it
wogan
that
the
box
is
in
the
first
tier
there
was
to
be
a
dinner
too
if
i
recollect
aright
i
have
not
dined
for
days
your
eminence
i
shall
be
extraordinarily
hungry
you
will
order
what
you
will
wogan
i
am
a
man
of
a
small
appetite
and
have
no
preferences
your
eminence
cook
will
be
the
better
judge
of
what
is
seasonable
your
eminence
will
be
the
more
likely
to
secure
the
box
in
the
first
tier
shall
we
fix
a
day
if
it
please
you
i
shall
have
the
honour
then
to
be
your
eminence
guest
the
cardinal
started
up
from
the
table
and
stared
at
his
visitor
you
are
jesting
said
he
so
little
replied
wogan
that
her
highness
the
princess
clementina
is
now
at
the
pilgrim
inn
at
bologna
in
bologna
cried
the
cardinal
and
he
stood
frowning
in
a
great
perturbation
of
spirit
this
is
great
news
he
said
but
in
a
doubtful
voice
which
wogan
did
not
understand
this
is
great
news
to
be
sure
and
he
took
a
turn
or
two
across
the
room
not
wholly
pleasant
news
one
might
almost
think
said
wogan
in
some
perplexity
never
was
better
news
exclaimed
the
cardinal
hastily
a
trifle
too
hastily
it
seemed
to
wogan
but
it
surprises
one
even
the
king
did
not
expect
this
most
desirable
issue
for
the
king
in
spain
it
is
that
which
troubles
me
her
highness
comes
to
bologna
and
the
king
in
spain
yes
said
wogan
with
a
wary
eye
upon
his
eminence
why
is
the
king
in
spain
there
is
pressing
business
in
spain
an
expedition
from
cadiz
the
king
presence
there
was
urged
most
earnestly
he
had
no
hope
you
would
succeed
i
myself
have
some
share
in
the
blame
i
did
not
hide
from
you
my
thought
mr
wogan
wogan
was
not
all
reassured
he
could
not
but
remember
that
the
excuse
for
the
king
absence
which
the
cardinal
now
made
to
him
was
precisely
that
which
he
himself
had
invented
to
appease
clementina
at
innspruck
it
was
the
simple
natural
excuse
which
came
first
of
all
to
the
tongue
tip
but
but
it
did
not
satisfy
there
was
besides
too
much
flurry
and
agitation
in
the
cardinal
manner
even
now
that
he
was
taking
snuff
he
spilled
the
most
of
it
from
the
trembling
of
his
fingers
moreover
he
must
give
reason
upon
reason
for
his
perturbation
the
while
he
let
his
supper
get
cold
her
highness
i
can
not
but
feel
will
have
reason
to
think
slightly
of
our
welcome
a
young
girl
she
will
expect
and
rightly
something
more
of
ceremony
as
her
due
your
eminence
does
not
know
her
interrupted
wogan
with
some
sharpness
his
eminence
was
adroit
enough
to
seize
the
occasion
of
ending
a
conversation
which
was
growing
with
every
minute
more
embarrassing
i
shall
make
haste
to
repair
my
defect
said
he
i
beg
you
to
present
my
duty
to
her
highness
and
to
request
her
to
receive
me
at
ten
by
that
i
will
hope
to
have
discovered
a
lodging
more
suitable
to
her
dignity
wogan
made
his
prayer
for
the
pope
intervention
on
jenny
behalf
and
then
returned
to
the
pilgrim
inn
dashed
and
fallen
in
spirit
he
had
thought
that
their
troubles
were
at
an
end
but
here
was
a
new
difficulty
at
which
in
truth
he
rather
feared
to
guess
the
departure
to
spain
had
been
a
puzzle
to
him
before
he
remembered
now
that
the
chevalier
had
agreed
with
reluctance
to
his
enterprise
and
had
never
been
more
than
lukewarm
in
its
support
that
reluctance
that
lukewarmness
he
had
attributed
to
a
natural
habit
of
discouragement
but
the
evasiveness
of
cardinal
origo
seemed
to
propose
a
different
explanation
wogan
would
not
guess
at
it
the
king
is
to
marry
the
princess
said
he
fiercely
i
brought
her
out
of
innspruck
to
bologna
the
king
must
marry
the
princess
and
quite
unawares
he
set
off
running
towards
the
inn
as
he
drew
near
to
it
he
heard
a
confused
noise
of
shouting
he
quickened
his
pace
and
rushing
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
side
street
into
the
square
where
the
inn
stood
came
suddenly
to
a
stop
the
square
was
filled
with
a
great
mob
of
people
and
in
face
of
the
inn
the
crowd
was
so
thick
wogan
could
have
walked
upon
the
shoulders
many
of
the
people
carried
blazing
torches
which
they
waved
in
the
air
dropping
the
burning
resin
upon
their
companions
others
threw
their
hats
skywards
here
were
boys
beating
drums
and
grown
men
blowing
upon
toy
trumpets
and
all
were
shouting
and
cheering
with
a
deafening
enthusiasm
the
news
of
the
princess
arrival
had
spread
like
wildfire
through
the
town
spirits
rose
at
a
bound
here
was
a
welcome
very
different
from
the
cardinal
wogan
rejoiced
in
the
good
sense
of
the
citizens
of
bologna
who
could
appreciate
the
great
qualities
of
his
chosen
woman
their
enthusiasm
did
them
credit
he
could
have
embraced
them
one
by
one
he
strove
to
push
his
way
towards
the
door
but
he
would
hardly
have
pierced
through
that
throng
had
not
a
man
by
the
light
of
a
torch
recognised
him
and
bawled
out
his
name
he
was
lifted
shoulder
high
in
a
second
he
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
over
the
heads
of
the
people
he
was
set
tenderly
down
in
the
very
doorway
of
the
pilgrim
inn
and
he
found
clementina
at
the
window
of
an
unlighted
room
gazing
unperceived
at
the
throng
here
a
true
welcome
madam
said
he
cordially
with
his
thoughts
away
upon
that
bluff
of
hillside
where
the
acclamations
had
seemed
so
distant
and
unreal
it
is
possible
that
they
seemed
of
small
account
to
clementina
now
for
though
they
rang
in
ears
and
were
visible
to
her
eyes
she
sat
quite
unmoved
by
them
this
is
one
tiny
square
in
a
little
town
he
continued
but
its
shouts
will
ring
across
europe
and
she
turned
her
head
to
him
and
said
quietly
the
king
is
still
in
spain
is
he
not
wogan
enthusiasm
was
quenched
in
alarm
her
voice
had
rung
for
all
its
quietude
with
pride
what
if
she
guessed
what
he
for
one
would
not
let
his
wildest
fancy
dwell
upon
wogan
repeated
to
himself
the
resolve
which
he
had
made
though
with
an
alteration
the
king
must
marry
the
princess
he
had
said
now
he
said
the
princess
must
marry
the
king
he
began
hurriedly
to
assure
her
that
the
king
had
doubted
his
capacity
to
bring
the
enterprise
to
a
favourable
issue
but
that
now
he
would
without
doubt
return
cardinal
origo
would
tell
her
more
upon
that
head
if
she
would
be
good
enough
to
receive
him
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
while
wogan
was
yet
speaking
a
torch
waved
and
amongst
that
throng
of
faces
below
him
in
the
street
one
sprang
to
his
view
with
a
remarkable
distinctness
a
face
most
menacing
and
vindictive
it
was
the
face
of
harry
whittington
just
for
a
second
it
shone
out
angles
and
lines
so
clearly
revealed
that
it
was
as
though
the
crowd
had
vanished
and
that
one
contorted
face
glared
alone
at
the
windows
in
a
flare
of
clementina
saw
the
face
too
for
she
drew
back
instinctively
within
the
curtains
of
the
window
the
man
at
peri
said
she
in
a
whisper
your
highness
will
pardon
me
exclaimed
wogan
and
he
made
a
movement
towards
the
door
then
he
stopped
hesitated
for
a
second
and
came
back
he
had
a
question
to
put
as
difficult
perhaps
as
ever
lips
had
to
frame
at
peri
he
said
in
a
stumbling
voice
i
waked
from
a
dream
and
saw
that
man
and
cunning
watching
over
the
rim
of
the
stairs
i
was
dreaming
that
a
star
out
of
heaven
stooped
towards
me
that
a
woman
face
shone
out
of
the
star
bright
heart
that
her
lips
deigned
to
bend
downwards
to
my
earth
and
i
wonder
i
wonder
whether
those
cunning
eyes
had
cunning
enough
to
interpret
my
dream
and
clementina
answered
him
simply
i
think
it
very
likely
that
they
had
so
much
skill
and
wogan
ran
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
he
forced
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
point
where
whittington
face
had
shown
but
his
hesitation
his
question
had
consumed
time
whittington
had
vanished
nor
did
he
appear
again
for
some
while
in
bologna
wogan
searched
for
him
high
and
low
here
was
another
difficulty
added
to
the
reluctance
of
his
king
the
pride
of
his
queen
whittington
had
a
piece
of
dangerous
knowledge
and
could
not
be
found
wogan
said
nothing
openly
of
the
man
treachery
though
he
kept
very
safely
the
paper
in
which
that
treachery
was
confessed
but
he
did
not
cease
from
his
search
he
was
still
engaged
upon
it
when
he
received
the
summons
from
cardinal
origo
he
hurried
to
the
palace
wondering
what
new
thing
had
befallen
and
was
at
once
admitted
to
the
cardinal
it
was
no
bad
thing
at
all
events
as
wogan
could
judge
from
the
cardinal
smiling
face
wogan
said
he
our
holy
father
the
pope
wishes
to
testify
his
approbation
of
your
remarkable
enterprise
on
behalf
of
a
princess
who
is
his
he
bids
me
hand
you
therefore
your
patent
of
roman
senator
and
request
you
to
present
yourself
at
the
capitol
in
rome
on
june
when
you
will
be
installed
with
all
the
ancient
ceremonies
wogan
thanked
his
eminence
dutifully
but
laid
the
patent
on
the
table
you
hardly
know
what
you
refuse
said
his
eminence
the
holy
father
has
no
greater
honour
to
bestow
and
believe
me
he
bestows
it
charily
nay
your
eminence
said
wogan
i
do
not
undervalue
so
high
a
distinction
but
i
had
three
friends
with
me
who
shared
every
danger
i
can
not
accept
an
honour
which
they
do
not
share
for
indeed
they
risked
more
than
i
did
for
they
hold
service
under
the
king
of
france
the
cardinal
was
pleased
to
compliment
wogan
upon
his
loyalty
to
his
friends
they
shall
not
be
the
losers
said
he
i
think
i
may
promise
indeed
that
each
will
have
a
step
in
rank
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
when
the
holy
father
hears
what
you
have
said
to
me
i
shall
have
three
other
patents
like
to
this
and
he
locked
wogan
away
in
a
drawer
and
what
of
the
king
in
spain
asked
wogan
i
sent
a
messenger
thither
on
the
night
of
your
coming
said
the
cardinal
but
it
is
a
long
journey
into
spain
we
must
wait
to
wogan
it
seemed
the
waiting
would
never
end
the
cardinal
had
found
a
little
house
set
apart
from
the
street
with
a
great
garden
of
lawns
and
and
laurels
and
in
that
garden
now
fresh
with
spring
flowers
and
made
private
by
high
walls
the
princess
passed
her
days
wogan
saw
her
but
seldom
during
this
time
but
each
occasion
sent
him
back
to
his
lodging
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
she
had
grown
silent
and
her
silence
alarmed
him
she
had
lost
the
sparkling
buoyancy
of
her
spirits
misset
who
attended
her
told
him
that
she
would
sit
for
long
whiles
with
a
red
spot
burning
in
each
cheek
wogan
feared
that
her
pride
was
chafing
her
gentleness
that
she
guessed
there
was
reluctance
in
the
king
delay
but
she
must
marry
the
king
he
still
persevered
in
declaring
her
hardships
her
imprisonment
her
perilous
escape
the
snows
of
innspruck
these
were
known
now
and
if
at
the
last
the
end
for
which
they
had
been
endured
wogan
broke
off
from
his
reflections
to
hear
the
world
laughing
the
world
would
not
think
it
would
laugh
for
her
own
sake
she
must
marry
he
cried
as
he
paced
about
his
rooms
for
ours
too
for
a
country
sake
and
he
looked
northwards
towards
england
but
for
her
own
sake
was
the
reason
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
but
the
days
passed
the
three
promised
patents
came
from
rome
and
cardinal
origo
unlocked
the
drawer
and
joined
wogan
to
them
he
presented
all
four
at
the
same
time
the
patents
carry
the
titles
of
said
he
beamed
with
delight
sure
said
he
i
will
have
a
toga
with
the
arms
of
the
embroidered
on
the
back
to
appear
in
at
the
capitol
it
is
on
june
your
eminence
upon
my
soul
i
have
not
much
time
and
he
grew
thoughtful
a
toga
will
hardly
take
a
month
even
with
the
embroidery
which
i
do
not
greatly
recommend
said
the
cardinal
drily
i
was
not
at
the
moment
thinking
of
the
toga
said
gloomily
and
what
of
the
king
in
spain
asked
wogan
we
must
wait
my
friend
said
the
cardinal
in
a
week
there
was
brought
to
wogan
one
morning
a
letter
in
the
hand
he
fingered
it
for
a
little
not
daring
to
break
the
seal
when
he
did
break
it
he
read
a
great
many
compliments
upon
his
success
and
after
the
compliments
a
statement
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
at
montefiascone
as
soon
as
the
king
could
depart
from
spain
and
after
that
statement
a
declaration
that
since
her
highness
position
was
not
meanwhile
one
that
suited
either
her
dignity
or
the
love
the
king
had
for
her
a
marriage
by
proxy
should
take
place
at
bologna
the
chevalier
added
that
he
had
written
to
cardinal
origo
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
the
ceremony
and
he
appointed
herewith
charles
wogan
to
act
as
his
proxy
in
recognition
of
his
great
services
wogan
felt
a
natural
distaste
for
the
part
he
was
to
take
in
the
ceremony
to
stand
up
before
the
cardinal
and
take
clementina
hand
in
his
and
speak
another
marriage
vows
and
receive
hers
as
deputy
there
was
a
certain
mockery
in
the
situation
for
which
he
had
no
liking
the
memory
of
the
cabin
on
the
was
something
too
near
but
at
all
events
the
king
was
to
marry
the
princess
and
wogan
distaste
was
swallowed
up
in
a
great
relief
there
would
be
no
laughter
rippling
over
europe
like
the
wind
over
a
field
of
corn
he
stood
by
his
window
in
the
spring
sunshine
with
a
great
contentment
of
spirit
and
then
there
came
a
loud
rapping
on
his
door
he
caught
his
breath
he
grew
white
with
a
sudden
fear
you
would
have
thought
it
was
his
heart
that
was
knocked
upon
for
there
was
another
side
to
the
business
the
king
would
marry
the
princess
but
how
would
the
princess
take
this
marriage
by
proxy
and
the
king
continued
absence
she
had
her
pride
as
he
knew
well
the
knocking
was
repeated
wogan
in
a
voice
of
suspense
bade
his
visitor
enter
the
visitor
was
one
of
her
highness
new
servants
without
a
doubt
thought
wogan
she
has
received
a
letter
by
the
same
messenger
who
brought
me
mine
the
servant
handed
him
a
note
from
the
princess
begging
him
to
attend
on
her
at
once
she
must
marry
the
king
said
wogan
to
himself
he
took
his
hat
and
cane
and
followed
the
servant
into
the
street
chapter
xxii
wogan
was
guided
through
the
streets
to
the
mouth
of
a
blind
alley
at
the
bottom
of
which
rose
a
high
garden
wall
and
over
the
wall
the
smoking
chimneys
of
a
house
among
the
tops
of
many
trees
freshly
green
which
shivered
in
the
breeze
and
shook
the
sunlight
from
their
leaves
this
alley
from
the
first
day
when
the
princess
came
to
lodge
in
the
house
had
worn
to
wogan
a
familiar
air
and
this
morning
as
he
pondered
dismally
whether
after
all
those
laborious
months
since
he
had
ridden
hopefully
out
of
bologna
to
ohlau
were
to
bear
no
fruit
he
chanced
to
remember
why
he
had
passed
that
alley
at
the
moment
of
grey
dawn
when
he
was
starting
out
upon
this
adventure
and
he
had
seen
a
man
muffled
in
a
cloak
step
from
its
mouth
and
suddenly
draw
back
as
his
horse
hoofs
rang
in
the
silent
street
as
though
to
elude
recognition
wogan
wondered
for
a
second
who
at
that
time
had
lived
in
the
house
but
he
was
admitted
through
a
door
in
the
wall
and
led
into
a
little
room
with
french
windows
opening
on
a
lawn
the
garden
seen
from
here
was
a
wealth
of
white
blossoms
and
yellow
and
amongst
them
clementina
paced
alone
the
richest
and
the
whitest
blossom
of
them
all
she
was
dressed
simply
in
a
white
gown
of
muslin
and
a
little
hat
of
straw
but
wogan
knew
as
he
advanced
towards
her
that
it
was
not
merely
the
hat
which
threw
the
dark
shadow
on
her
face
she
took
a
step
or
two
towards
him
and
began
at
once
without
any
friendly
greeting
in
a
cold
formal
voice
you
have
received
a
letter
this
morning
from
his
majesty
yes
your
highness
why
does
the
king
linger
in
spain
the
expedition
from
cadiz
which
left
harbour
a
week
ago
well
wogan
she
asked
in
biting
tones
how
does
that
expedition
now
on
the
high
seas
detain
his
majesty
in
spain
wogan
was
utterly
dumfounded
he
stood
and
gazed
at
her
a
great
trouble
in
his
eyes
and
his
wits
with
that
expedition
all
at
sea
is
your
highness
sure
he
babbled
oh
indeed
most
sure
she
replied
with
the
hardest
laugh
which
he
had
ever
heard
from
a
woman
lips
i
did
not
know
he
said
in
dejection
and
she
took
a
step
nearer
to
him
and
her
cheeks
flamed
is
that
the
truth
she
asked
her
voice
trembling
with
anger
you
did
not
know
and
wogan
understood
that
the
real
trouble
with
her
at
this
moment
was
not
so
much
the
king
delay
in
spain
as
a
doubt
whether
he
himself
had
played
with
her
and
spoken
her
false
for
if
he
was
proved
untrue
here
why
he
might
have
been
untrue
throughout
on
the
stairway
at
innspruck
on
the
road
to
ala
in
the
hut
on
the
bluff
of
the
hills
he
could
see
how
harshly
the
doubt
would
buffet
her
pride
how
it
would
wound
her
to
the
soul
it
is
the
truth
he
answered
you
will
believe
it
i
pledge
my
soul
upon
it
lay
your
hand
in
mine
i
will
repeat
it
standing
so
could
i
speak
false
with
your
hand
close
in
mine
he
held
out
his
hand
she
did
not
move
nor
did
her
attitude
of
distrust
relent
could
you
not
she
asked
icily
wogan
was
baffled
he
was
angered
have
i
ever
told
you
lies
he
asked
passionately
and
she
answered
yes
and
steadily
looked
him
in
the
face
the
monosyllable
quenched
him
like
a
pail
of
cold
water
he
stood
silent
perplexed
trying
to
remember
when
he
asked
in
the
berlin
between
brixen
and
wellishmile
wogan
remembered
that
he
had
told
her
of
his
city
of
dreams
but
it
was
plainly
not
to
that
that
she
referred
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
can
not
remember
you
told
me
of
an
attack
made
upon
a
scottish
town
what
time
the
king
was
there
in
the
year
he
forced
a
passage
through
nine
grenadiers
with
loaded
muskets
and
escaped
over
the
where
he
played
a
game
of
among
the
chimneys
ah
you
remember
the
story
now
there
was
a
chain
i
remember
which
even
then
as
you
told
of
it
puzzled
me
he
threw
the
chain
over
the
head
of
one
of
those
nine
grenadiers
and
crossing
his
arms
jerked
it
tight
about
the
man
neck
stifling
his
cry
of
warning
chain
i
asked
and
you
answered
oh
sir
with
a
practised
readiness
chain
he
wore
about
his
neck
do
you
remember
that
the
chain
linked
your
wogan
it
was
your
own
escape
of
which
you
told
me
why
did
you
ascribe
your
exploits
to
your
king
your
highness
he
said
we
know
the
king
we
who
have
served
him
day
in
and
day
out
for
years
we
can
say
freely
to
each
other
achievements
they
are
to
come
we
were
in
scotland
with
him
and
we
know
they
will
not
fail
to
come
but
with
you
it
different
you
did
not
know
him
you
asked
what
he
had
done
and
i
told
you
you
asked
for
more
you
said
his
throng
of
adventurers
each
of
whom
has
something
to
his
credit
what
has
he
the
chief
adventurer
well
sir
why
not
the
truth
in
answer
to
the
question
because
the
truth
unfair
to
him
and
was
the
untruth
fair
to
me
wogan
was
silent
i
think
i
understand
she
continued
bitterly
you
thought
here
a
foolish
girl
aflame
for
knights
and
monsters
overthrown
she
cries
for
deeds
not
statecraft
well
out
of
your
many
you
would
toss
her
one
and
call
it
the
king
you
could
afford
the
loss
and
she
please
god
would
be
content
with
it
she
spoke
with
an
extraordinary
violence
in
a
low
trembling
voice
and
she
would
not
listen
to
wogan
stammered
interruption
very
likely
too
the
rest
of
your
words
to
me
was
of
a
piece
i
was
a
girl
and
girls
are
to
have
gallant
speeches
given
to
them
like
so
many
lollipops
oh
but
you
have
hurt
me
beyond
words
i
would
not
have
thought
i
could
have
suffered
so
much
pain
that
last
cry
wrung
wogan
heart
she
turned
away
from
him
with
the
tears
brimming
in
her
eyes
it
was
this
conjecture
of
hers
which
he
had
dreaded
which
at
all
costs
he
must
dispel
do
not
believe
it
he
exclaimed
think
should
i
have
been
at
so
much
pains
to
refrain
from
speech
if
speech
was
what
i
had
intended
how
should
i
know
but
what
that
concealment
was
part
of
the
gallantry
a
necessary
preface
to
the
pretty
speeches
should
i
have
urged
your
rescue
on
the
king
had
i
believed
you
what
you
will
have
it
that
i
did
a
mere
witless
girl
to
be
pampered
with
follies
then
you
admit
she
cried
you
the
king
should
i
have
travelled
over
europe
to
search
for
a
wife
and
lit
on
you
should
i
have
ridden
to
ohlau
and
pestered
your
father
till
he
yielded
should
i
have
ridden
across
europe
to
strasbourg
should
i
have
endangered
my
friends
in
the
rush
to
innspruck
no
no
no
from
first
to
last
you
were
the
chosen
woman
the
vehemence
and
fire
of
sincerity
with
which
he
spoke
had
its
effect
on
her
she
turned
again
towards
him
with
a
gleam
of
hopefulness
in
her
face
but
midway
in
the
turn
she
stopped
you
spoke
to
me
words
which
i
have
not
forgotten
she
said
doubtfully
you
said
the
king
had
need
of
me
i
will
be
frank
hoping
that
you
will
match
my
frankness
on
that
morning
when
we
climbed
down
the
gorge
and
ever
since
i
cheered
myself
with
that
one
thought
the
king
had
need
of
me
never
was
truer
word
spoken
said
wogan
stoutly
then
why
is
the
king
in
spain
they
had
come
back
to
the
first
question
wogan
had
no
new
answer
to
it
he
said
i
do
not
know
for
a
moment
or
two
clementina
searched
his
eyes
it
seemed
in
the
end
that
she
was
satisfied
he
spoke
the
truth
for
she
said
in
a
voice
of
greater
gentleness
then
i
will
acquaint
you
will
you
walk
with
me
for
half
a
mile
wogan
bowed
and
followed
her
out
of
the
garden
he
could
not
think
whither
she
was
leading
him
or
for
what
purpose
she
walked
without
a
word
to
him
he
followed
without
a
question
and
so
pacing
with
much
dignity
they
came
to
the
steps
of
a
great
house
then
clementina
halted
sir
said
she
can
you
put
a
name
to
the
house
upon
my
word
your
highness
i
can
not
it
is
the
caprara
palace
said
she
suddenly
and
suddenly
she
bent
her
eyes
upon
wogan
the
name
however
conveyed
no
meaning
whatever
to
him
and
his
blank
face
told
her
so
clearly
she
nodded
in
a
sort
of
approval
no
she
said
relenting
you
did
not
know
she
mounted
the
steps
and
knocking
upon
the
door
was
admitted
by
an
old
broken
who
told
her
that
the
princess
caprara
was
away
it
was
permitted
him
however
to
show
the
many
curiosities
and
treasures
of
the
palace
to
such
visitors
as
desired
it
clementina
did
desire
it
the
old
man
led
her
and
her
companion
to
the
armoury
where
he
was
for
spending
much
time
and
breath
over
the
trophies
which
the
distinguished
general
caprara
had
of
old
rapt
from
the
infidels
but
clementina
quickly
broke
in
upon
his
garrulity
i
have
a
great
wish
to
see
the
picture
gallery
said
she
and
the
old
man
tottered
onwards
through
many
shrouded
and
darkened
rooms
in
the
picture
gallery
he
drew
up
the
blinds
and
then
took
a
wand
in
his
hand
will
you
show
me
first
the
portrait
of
mlle
de
caprara
said
clementina
it
was
a
portrait
painted
with
remarkable
skill
maria
vittoria
de
caprara
was
represented
in
a
black
dress
and
the
warm
italian
colouring
of
her
face
made
a
sort
of
glow
in
the
dark
picture
her
eyes
watched
you
from
the
canvas
with
so
a
glance
you
had
a
thought
when
you
turned
that
they
turned
after
you
clementina
gazed
at
the
picture
for
a
long
while
and
the
blood
slowly
mounted
on
her
neck
and
transfused
her
cheeks
there
is
a
face
wogan
a
passionate
beautiful
face
which
might
well
set
a
seal
upon
a
man
heart
i
do
not
wonder
i
can
well
believe
that
though
that
face
gladdens
the
streets
of
rome
a
lover
in
spain
might
see
it
through
all
the
thick
earth
of
the
pyrenees
there
sir
i
promised
to
acquaint
you
why
the
king
lingered
in
spain
i
have
fulfilled
that
promise
and
making
a
present
to
the
custodian
she
walked
back
through
the
rooms
and
down
the
steps
to
the
street
wogan
followed
her
and
pacing
with
much
dignity
they
walked
back
to
the
little
house
among
the
trees
and
so
came
again
into
the
garden
of
blossoms
the
anger
had
now
gone
from
her
face
but
it
was
replaced
by
a
great
weariness
it
is
strange
is
it
not
she
said
with
a
faltering
smile
that
on
a
spring
morning
beneath
this
sky
amongst
these
flowers
i
should
think
with
envy
of
the
snows
of
innspruck
and
my
prison
there
but
i
owe
you
a
reparation
she
added
you
said
the
king
had
need
of
me
for
that
saying
of
yours
i
find
an
apt
simile
call
it
a
stone
on
which
you
bade
me
set
my
foot
and
step
i
stepped
and
found
that
your
stone
was
straw
no
madam
cried
wogan
i
had
a
thought
she
continued
you
knew
the
stone
was
straw
when
you
commended
it
to
me
as
stone
but
this
morning
i
have
learned
my
error
i
acquit
you
and
ask
your
pardon
you
did
not
know
that
the
king
had
no
need
of
me
and
she
bowed
to
him
as
though
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
wogan
however
would
not
let
her
go
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
her
engrossed
in
his
one
thought
she
must
marry
the
king
he
spoke
however
none
the
less
with
sincerity
when
he
cried
nor
do
i
know
now
no
and
i
shall
not
know
you
have
walked
with
me
to
the
caprara
palace
this
morning
or
did
i
dream
we
walked
what
your
highness
has
shown
me
i
can
not
gainsay
for
this
is
the
first
time
that
ever
i
heard
of
mlle
de
caprara
but
i
am
very
sure
that
you
draw
your
inference
amiss
you
sit
in
judgment
on
the
king
not
knowing
him
you
push
aside
the
firm
trust
of
us
who
know
him
as
a
thing
of
no
account
and
because
once
in
a
mood
of
remorse
at
my
own
presumption
i
ascribed
one
trivial
exploit
at
the
best
a
success
of
muscle
and
not
brain
to
the
king
which
was
not
his
you
strip
him
of
all
merit
on
the
instant
he
saw
that
her
face
flushed
here
at
all
events
he
had
hit
the
mark
and
he
cried
out
with
a
ringing
confidence
your
stone
is
stone
not
straw
prove
it
me
said
she
what
do
you
know
of
the
princess
caprara
at
the
end
of
it
all
you
have
told
me
this
morning
all
you
know
i
will
go
bail
if
the
whole
truth
were
out
the
matter
would
take
a
very
different
complexion
again
she
said
prove
that
to
me
and
then
she
looked
over
his
shoulder
wogan
turned
and
saw
that
a
servant
was
coming
from
the
house
across
the
lawn
with
a
letter
on
a
salver
the
princess
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
then
she
turned
again
to
wogan
his
eminence
the
cardinal
fixes
the
marriage
in
bologna
here
for
fortnight
you
have
thus
two
weeks
wherein
to
make
your
word
good
two
weeks
and
wogan
had
not
an
idea
in
his
head
as
to
how
he
was
to
set
about
the
business
but
he
bowed
imperturbably
within
two
weeks
i
will
convince
your
highness
said
he
and
for
a
good
he
sauntered
with
her
about
the
garden
before
he
took
his
leave
chapter
xxiii
but
his
thoughts
had
been
busy
during
that
and
as
soon
as
he
had
come
out
from
the
mouth
of
the
alley
he
ran
to
gaydon
lodging
gaydon
however
was
not
in
lodged
in
the
same
house
and
wogan
mounted
to
his
apartments
hoping
there
to
find
news
of
whereabouts
but
was
taking
the
air
too
but
wogan
found
servant
where
will
i
find
captain
asked
wogan
you
will
find
his
excellency
said
the
servant
with
a
reproachful
emphasis
upon
the
title
at
the
little
bookseller
in
the
piazza
wogan
sprang
down
the
stairs
and
hurried
to
the
piazza
wondering
what
in
the
world
was
doing
at
a
bookseller
was
bending
over
the
counter
which
was
spread
with
open
books
and
wogan
hailed
him
from
the
doorway
turned
and
blushed
a
deep
crimson
he
came
to
the
door
as
if
to
prevent
wogan
entrance
into
the
shop
wogan
however
had
but
one
thought
in
his
head
where
shall
i
find
gaydon
he
asked
he
went
towards
the
via
san
vitale
replied
wogan
set
off
again
and
in
an
hour
came
upon
gaydon
he
had
lost
an
hour
of
his
fortnight
with
the
during
which
he
had
sauntered
in
the
garden
an
hour
and
a
half
you
went
to
rome
in
the
spring
said
he
there
you
saw
the
king
did
you
see
anyone
else
by
any
chance
whilst
you
were
in
rome
edgar
replied
gaydon
with
a
glance
from
the
tail
of
his
eye
which
wogan
did
not
fail
to
remark
aha
said
he
edgar
to
be
sure
since
you
saw
the
king
but
besides
edgar
did
you
see
anyone
else
whittington
said
gaydon
oho
said
wogan
thoughtfully
so
you
saw
my
friend
harry
whittington
at
rome
did
you
see
him
with
the
king
gaydon
was
becoming
manifestly
uncomfortable
he
was
waiting
for
the
king
he
replied
indeed
and
whereabouts
was
he
waiting
for
the
king
oh
outside
a
house
in
rome
said
gaydon
as
though
he
barely
remembered
the
incident
it
was
no
business
of
mine
that
i
could
see
none
whatever
to
be
sure
answered
wogan
cordially
but
why
in
the
world
should
whittington
be
waiting
for
the
king
outside
a
house
in
rome
it
was
he
carried
a
lantern
of
course
if
it
was
exclaimed
wogan
in
his
most
unsuspicious
accent
and
the
king
wished
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
house
in
rome
he
would
take
an
attendant
with
a
lantern
a
servant
though
one
would
have
thought
unless
of
course
it
was
a
private
sort
of
visit
it
was
no
business
of
mine
gaydon
interrupted
and
so
i
made
no
inquiries
of
whittington
but
whittington
did
not
wait
for
inquiries
eh
said
wogan
shrewdly
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
my
friend
something
which
that
good
honest
simpleton
of
a
whittington
blurted
out
to
you
without
the
least
thought
of
making
any
disclosure
oh
i
know
my
whittington
and
i
know
you
too
dick
i
do
not
blame
you
for
when
the
king
goes
the
princess
caprara
privately
at
while
the
girl
to
whom
he
is
betrothed
suffers
in
prison
for
her
courageous
loyalty
to
him
and
his
best
friends
are
risking
their
heads
to
set
her
free
why
knowledge
a
man
would
be
glad
to
keep
even
out
of
his
own
hearing
so
you
see
i
know
more
than
you
credit
me
with
so
tell
me
the
rest
fob
me
off
do
plead
it
is
none
of
your
business
for
upon
my
soul
it
is
gaydon
suddenly
changed
his
manner
he
spoke
with
no
less
earnestness
than
wogan
you
are
in
the
right
it
is
my
business
and
why
because
it
touches
you
charles
wogan
and
you
are
my
friend
therefore
you
will
tell
me
cried
wogan
therefore
i
will
not
tell
you
answered
gaydon
he
had
a
very
keen
recollection
of
certain
pages
of
poetry
he
had
seen
on
the
table
at
schlestadt
of
certain
conversations
in
the
berlin
when
he
had
feigned
to
sleep
wogan
caught
him
by
the
arm
i
must
know
here
have
i
lost
two
hours
out
of
one
poor
fortnight
i
must
know
why
gaydon
stood
quite
unmoved
and
with
a
remarkable
sternness
of
expression
wogan
understood
that
only
the
truth
would
unlock
his
lips
and
he
cried
because
unless
i
do
in
a
fortnight
her
highness
will
refuse
to
marry
the
king
and
he
recounted
to
him
the
walk
he
had
taken
and
the
conversation
he
had
held
with
clementina
that
morning
gaydon
listened
with
an
unfeigned
surprise
the
story
put
wogan
in
quite
a
different
light
and
moreover
it
was
told
with
so
much
sincerity
of
voice
and
so
clear
a
simplicity
of
language
gaydon
could
not
doubt
one
syllable
i
am
afraid
my
friend
said
he
my
thoughts
have
done
you
some
wrong
leave
me
out
of
them
cried
wogan
impatiently
he
had
no
notion
and
no
desire
to
hear
what
gaydon
meant
tell
me
from
first
to
last
what
you
saw
in
rome
gaydon
told
him
thereupon
of
that
secret
passage
from
the
house
into
the
back
street
and
of
that
promenade
to
the
house
which
he
had
spied
upon
wogan
listened
without
any
remark
and
yet
without
any
attempt
to
quicken
his
informant
but
as
soon
as
he
had
the
story
he
set
off
at
a
run
towards
the
cardinal
palace
so
the
princess
he
thought
had
more
than
a
rumour
to
go
upon
though
how
she
came
by
her
knowledge
the
devil
only
knows
at
the
palace
he
was
told
that
the
cardinal
was
gone
to
the
archiginnasio
i
will
wait
said
wogan
and
he
waited
in
the
library
for
an
hour
another
priceless
hour
of
that
swiftly
passing
fortnight
and
he
was
not
a
whit
nearer
to
his
end
he
made
it
his
business
however
to
show
a
composed
face
to
his
eminence
and
since
his
eminence
dinner
was
ready
to
make
a
pretence
of
sharing
the
meal
the
cardinal
was
in
a
mood
of
great
contentment
it
is
your
presence
wogan
puts
me
in
a
good
humour
he
was
pleased
to
say
or
a
certain
letter
your
eminence
received
from
spain
asked
wogan
true
the
letter
was
one
to
cause
all
the
king
friends
satisfaction
and
some
few
of
them
perhaps
relief
said
wogan
the
cardinal
glanced
at
wogan
but
with
a
quite
impassive
countenance
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
inhaled
it
delicately
then
he
glanced
at
wogan
again
i
have
a
hope
wogan
said
he
with
a
great
cordiality
you
shall
tell
me
if
it
is
to
fall
i
see
much
of
you
of
late
and
i
have
a
hope
that
you
are
thinking
of
the
priesthood
we
should
welcome
you
very
gladly
you
may
be
sure
who
knows
but
what
there
is
a
cardinal
hat
hung
up
in
the
anteroom
of
the
future
for
you
to
take
down
from
its
peg
the
suggestion
was
sufficiently
startling
to
wogan
who
had
thought
of
nothing
less
than
of
entering
into
orders
but
he
was
not
to
be
diverted
by
this
piece
of
ingenuity
your
eminence
said
he
although
i
hold
myself
unworthy
of
priestly
vows
i
am
here
in
truth
in
the
character
of
a
catechist
catechise
then
my
friend
said
the
cardinal
with
a
smile
first
then
i
would
ask
your
eminence
how
many
of
the
king
followers
have
had
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
the
princess
clementina
very
few
might
i
know
the
names
to
be
sure
cardinal
origo
repeated
three
or
four
names
they
were
the
names
of
men
known
to
wogan
for
irreproachable
loyalty
not
one
of
them
would
have
gone
about
the
princess
with
slanders
upon
his
master
he
would
have
gone
bail
for
them
all
at
least
a
month
ago
he
would
he
reflected
though
now
indeed
he
hardly
knew
where
to
put
his
trust
her
highness
lives
as
you
know
a
very
suitable
secluded
life
continued
origo
but
might
not
others
have
had
access
to
her
at
the
pilgrim
inn
nay
she
was
there
but
the
one
night
the
night
of
her
arrival
i
do
not
think
it
likely
for
if
you
remember
i
myself
went
to
her
early
the
next
morning
and
by
a
stroke
of
good
luck
i
had
already
come
upon
the
little
house
in
the
garden
which
was
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
of
yours
for
her
highness
service
on
the
evening
of
our
arrival
a
friend
of
mine
offered
you
the
house
said
wogan
puzzling
over
who
that
friend
could
be
yes
harry
whittington
wogan
started
to
his
feet
so
after
all
whittington
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
trouble
wogan
wondered
whether
he
had
done
wisely
not
to
publish
the
fellow
treachery
but
he
could
not
no
he
had
to
make
his
account
with
the
man
alone
there
were
reasons
it
was
harry
whittington
who
offered
the
house
for
her
highness
use
wogan
exclaimed
it
was
an
offer
most
apt
and
kind
and
made
on
the
evening
of
our
arrival
not
an
hour
after
you
left
me
but
you
are
surprised
wogan
was
reflecting
that
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
and
indeed
just
before
whittington
made
his
offer
to
origo
he
had
seen
face
by
the
torchlight
in
the
square
that
face
lived
very
plainly
in
wogan
thoughts
it
was
certainly
not
for
clementina
service
that
whittington
had
offered
the
house
wogan
resumed
his
seat
saying
carelessly
i
was
surprised
for
i
had
a
notion
that
whittington
lodged
opposite
the
torre
garisenda
and
not
at
the
house
nor
did
he
he
hired
it
for
a
friend
who
has
now
left
bologna
man
or
woman
asked
wogan
remembering
that
visitor
who
had
drawn
back
into
the
alley
one
early
morning
of
last
autumn
the
man
might
very
likely
have
been
whittington
i
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
said
the
cardinal
but
wogan
why
do
you
ask
me
these
questions
i
have
not
come
yet
to
the
end
of
them
answered
wogan
there
is
one
more
ask
it
said
his
eminence
crossing
his
legs
will
your
eminence
oblige
me
with
a
history
of
the
affection
of
maria
vittoria
mlle
de
caprara
for
the
king
the
cardinal
uncrossed
his
legs
and
bounced
in
his
chair
here
is
a
question
indeed
he
stuttered
and
a
history
of
the
king
response
to
it
continued
wogan
implacably
with
a
particular
account
of
why
the
king
lingers
in
spain
after
the
cadiz
expedition
has
put
out
to
sea
origo
was
now
quite
still
his
face
was
pale
and
he
had
lost
in
an
instant
that
air
of
affectation
which
so
contrasted
with
his
broad
features
this
is
very
dangerous
talk
said
he
solemnly
not
so
dangerous
as
silence
some
foolish
slanderer
has
been
busy
at
your
ears
not
at
my
ears
returned
wogan
the
cardinal
took
his
meaning
is
it
so
indeed
said
he
thoughtfully
once
or
twice
then
he
reached
out
his
hand
towards
an
escritoire
but
here
the
king
letter
come
this
morning
it
is
not
enough
said
wogan
for
the
king
lingers
in
spain
and
the
portrait
of
maria
vittoria
glows
on
the
walls
of
the
caprara
palace
whither
i
was
bidden
to
escort
her
highness
this
morning
the
cardinal
walked
thoughtfully
to
and
fro
about
the
room
but
made
up
his
mind
in
the
end
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
of
the
matter
wogan
the
king
saw
mlle
de
caprara
for
the
first
time
while
you
were
searching
europe
for
a
wife
for
him
he
saw
her
here
one
morning
at
mass
in
the
church
of
the
crucifixion
and
came
away
most
silent
of
their
acquaintance
i
need
not
speak
the
king
just
for
one
month
became
an
ardent
youth
he
appealed
to
the
pope
for
his
consent
to
marry
mlle
de
caprara
and
the
pope
consented
the
king
was
just
sending
off
a
message
to
bid
you
cease
your
search
when
you
came
back
with
the
news
that
her
highness
the
princess
clementina
had
accepted
the
king
hand
and
would
shortly
set
out
for
bologna
sir
the
king
was
in
despair
though
he
showed
to
you
a
smiling
grateful
face
mlle
de
caprara
went
to
rome
the
king
stayed
here
awaiting
his
betrothed
there
came
the
news
of
her
imprisonment
the
king
after
all
is
a
man
if
his
heart
leaped
a
little
at
the
news
who
shall
blame
him
do
you
remember
how
you
came
privately
one
night
to
the
king
cabinet
and
found
me
there
in
the
king
company
but
stammered
wogan
i
do
remember
that
evening
i
remember
that
the
king
was
pale
discouraged
and
why
said
origo
because
her
highness
journey
had
been
interrupted
because
the
marriage
now
seemed
impossible
no
but
because
charles
wogan
was
back
in
bologna
because
charles
wogan
had
sought
for
a
private
interview
because
the
king
had
no
more
doubt
than
i
as
to
what
charles
wogan
intended
to
propose
and
because
the
king
knew
that
what
wogan
set
his
hand
to
was
as
good
as
done
you
remember
i
threw
such
hindrances
as
i
could
in
your
way
and
made
much
of
the
risks
you
must
run
and
the
impossibility
of
your
task
now
you
know
why
never
was
a
man
more
confused
than
wogan
at
this
story
of
the
cardinal
it
makes
me
out
a
mere
meddlesome
fool
he
cried
and
sat
stunned
it
is
an
unprofitable
question
at
this
time
of
day
said
the
cardinal
with
a
smile
matters
have
gone
so
far
that
they
can
no
longer
be
remedied
this
marriage
must
take
place
true
said
wogan
the
king
indeed
is
firmly
inclined
to
it
yet
he
lingers
in
spain
that
i
can
not
explain
to
you
but
he
has
been
most
loyal
that
you
must
take
my
word
for
so
must
your
princess
yet
this
winter
when
i
was
at
schlestadt
preparing
the
expedition
to
innspruck
wogan
said
with
a
certain
timidity
for
he
no
longer
felt
that
it
was
within
his
right
to
make
reproaches
the
king
was
in
rome
visiting
mlle
de
caprara
the
cardinal
flushed
with
some
anger
at
wogan
persistence
come
sir
said
he
what
has
soured
you
with
suspicions
upon
my
word
here
is
a
man
sitting
with
me
who
bears
your
name
but
few
of
those
good
qualities
the
name
is
linked
with
in
my
memories
your
king
saw
mlle
de
caprara
once
in
rome
once
only
major
gaydon
had
come
at
your
request
to
rome
to
fetch
a
letter
in
the
king
hand
bidding
her
highness
entrust
herself
to
you
up
to
that
moment
the
issue
of
your
exploit
was
in
the
balance
but
your
request
was
to
the
king
a
very
certain
sign
that
you
would
indeed
succeed
so
the
night
before
he
wrote
the
letter
he
went
to
the
caprara
palace
and
took
his
farewell
of
the
woman
he
loved
so
much
may
be
pardoned
to
any
man
even
by
you
who
it
seems
stand
pinnacled
above
these
earthly
affections
the
blood
rushed
into
wogan
face
at
the
sneer
but
he
bowed
his
head
to
it
being
much
humbled
by
origo
disclosures
this
story
i
have
told
you
continued
the
cardinal
i
will
make
bold
to
tell
to
her
highness
but
you
must
also
explain
why
the
king
lingers
in
spain
wogan
objected
i
am
very
certain
of
it
the
princess
has
her
pride
she
will
not
marry
a
reluctant
man
well
that
i
can
not
do
cried
the
cardinal
now
fairly
exasperated
pride
she
has
her
pride
is
it
to
ruin
a
cause
this
pride
of
hers
is
it
to
wreck
a
policy
no
cried
wogan
starting
up
i
have
a
fortnight
i
beg
your
eminence
not
to
speak
one
word
to
her
highness
until
this
fortnight
is
gone
until
the
eve
of
the
marriage
in
bologna
give
me
till
then
i
have
a
hope
there
will
be
no
need
for
us
to
speak
at
all
the
cardinal
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
must
do
more
than
hope
will
you
pledge
your
word
to
it
here
it
seemed
to
wogan
was
an
occasion
when
a
man
must
dare
yes
he
said
and
so
went
out
of
the
house
he
had
spoken
under
a
sudden
inspiration
the
cardinal
words
had
shown
him
a
way
which
with
careful
treading
might
lead
to
his
desired
result
he
went
first
to
his
lodging
and
ordered
his
servant
marnier
to
saddle
his
black
horse
then
he
hurried
again
to
lodging
and
found
his
friend
back
from
the
bookseller
indeed
but
breathing
very
hard
of
a
book
which
he
slid
behind
his
back
i
am
to
go
on
a
journey
said
wogan
and
there
a
delicate
sort
of
work
i
would
trust
to
you
looked
distantly
at
wogan
said
he
in
a
voice
i
want
you
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
little
house
in
the
garden
nodded
hortus
said
he
and
he
fingered
the
book
at
his
back
no
horto
do
you
know
my
friend
that
the
difference
between
the
second
and
fourth
declensions
was
solely
invented
by
the
grammarians
for
their
own
profit
it
is
of
no
manner
of
use
and
the
most
plaguy
business
that
ever
i
heard
of
cried
wogan
with
a
bang
of
his
fist
you
are
no
more
listening
to
me
than
this
table
at
once
face
brightened
and
with
a
shout
of
pride
he
reeled
out
mensa
mensam
mensae
mensae
wogan
sprang
up
in
a
rage
do
me
when
i
am
talking
most
seriously
to
you
what
is
it
you
are
after
what
that
book
you
are
hiding
let
me
look
at
it
blushed
on
every
visible
inch
of
him
and
handed
the
book
to
wogan
it
a
latin
grammar
my
friend
said
he
meekly
and
what
in
the
world
do
you
want
to
be
addling
your
brains
with
a
latin
grammar
for
when
there
other
need
for
your
eyes
are
we
to
be
enrolled
at
the
capitol
in
june
as
roman
senators
with
all
the
ancient
honours
it
is
so
which
are
psalters
or
pshawms
well
what
then
you
do
understand
charles
the
difficulty
of
my
position
you
have
latin
at
your
sure
i
have
often
admired
you
for
your
extraordinary
comprehension
of
latin
but
never
more
than
i
do
now
it
will
be
no
trouble
in
the
world
for
you
to
trip
off
a
neat
little
speech
thanking
the
senators
kindly
for
the
great
honour
they
are
doing
themselves
in
electing
us
into
their
noble
body
but
it
will
not
be
easy
for
me
said
with
a
sigh
how
can
i
get
enough
latin
through
my
skull
by
june
not
to
disgrace
myself
he
looked
so
utterly
miserable
and
distressed
that
wogan
never
felt
less
inclined
to
laugh
i
sit
up
at
nights
with
a
lamp
but
the
most
unaccountable
thing
happens
i
may
come
in
here
as
lively
as
any
cricket
but
the
moment
i
take
this
book
in
my
hands
i
am
overpowered
with
sleep
oh
listen
to
me
cried
wogan
i
have
only
a
fortnight
and
i
have
only
till
june
sighed
but
there
i
am
listening
i
have
no
doubt
my
friend
your
business
is
more
important
than
mine
he
said
with
the
simplicity
of
which
not
one
of
his
friends
could
resist
the
appeal
wogan
could
not
now
my
business
he
said
is
only
more
important
because
you
have
no
need
of
your
latin
grammar
at
all
there
a
special
deputy
a
learned
professor
appointed
on
these
occasions
to
make
a
speech
for
us
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
sit
still
and
nod
our
heads
wisely
when
he
looks
towards
us
is
that
all
cried
jumping
up
swear
it
i
do
said
wogan
and
here
to
the
devil
with
the
latin
grammar
exclaimed
he
flung
open
his
window
and
hurled
the
book
out
across
the
street
with
the
full
force
of
his
prodigious
arm
there
followed
a
crash
and
then
the
tinkle
of
falling
glass
beamed
contentedly
and
shut
the
window
now
what
will
i
do
for
you
in
return
for
this
he
asked
keep
a
watch
on
the
little
house
and
the
garden
i
will
tell
you
why
when
i
return
observe
who
goes
in
to
visit
the
princess
but
hinder
no
one
only
remember
who
they
are
and
let
me
know
and
wogan
got
back
to
his
lodging
and
mounted
his
black
horse
he
could
trust
to
play
watchdog
in
his
absence
if
the
mysterious
visitor
who
had
bestowed
upon
clementina
with
so
liberal
a
hand
so
much
innuendo
and
such
an
artful
combination
of
truth
and
falsity
were
to
come
again
to
the
little
house
to
confirm
the
slanders
wogan
in
the
end
would
not
fail
to
discover
the
visitor
identity
he
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
and
rode
out
from
bologna
four
days
afterwards
he
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
the
caprara
palace
chapter
xxiv
maria
vittoria
received
the
name
of
her
visitor
with
a
profound
astonishment
then
she
stamped
her
foot
and
said
violently
send
him
away
i
hate
him
but
curiosity
got
the
better
of
her
hate
she
felt
a
strong
desire
to
see
the
meddlesome
man
who
had
thrust
himself
between
her
and
her
lover
and
before
her
woman
had
got
so
far
as
the
door
she
said
let
him
up
to
me
she
was
again
surprised
when
wogan
was
admitted
for
she
expected
a
stout
and
burly
soldier
stupid
and
confident
of
the
type
which
blunders
into
success
through
sheer
ignorance
of
the
probabilities
of
defeat
wogan
for
his
part
saw
the
glowing
original
of
the
picture
at
bologna
but
armed
at
all
points
with
hostility
your
business
said
she
curtly
wogan
no
less
curtly
replied
that
he
had
a
wish
to
escort
mlle
de
caprara
to
bologna
he
spoke
as
though
he
was
suggesting
a
walk
on
the
campagna
and
why
should
i
travel
to
bologna
she
asked
wogan
explained
the
explanation
required
delicacy
but
he
put
it
in
as
few
words
as
might
be
there
were
slanderers
at
work
her
highness
the
princess
clementina
was
in
great
distress
a
word
from
mlle
de
caprara
would
make
all
clear
why
should
i
trouble
because
the
princess
clementina
has
a
crumpled
in
her
bed
i
will
not
go
said
mlle
de
caprara
yet
her
highness
may
justly
ask
why
the
king
lingers
in
spain
wogan
saw
a
look
a
smile
of
triumph
brighten
for
an
instant
on
the
angry
face
it
is
no
doubt
a
humiliation
to
the
princess
clementina
said
maria
vittoria
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
but
she
must
learn
to
bear
humiliation
like
other
women
but
she
will
reject
the
marriage
urged
wogan
the
fool
cried
maria
vittoria
and
she
laughed
almost
gaily
i
will
not
budge
an
inch
to
persuade
her
to
it
let
her
fancy
what
she
will
and
weep
over
it
i
hate
her
therefore
she
is
out
of
my
thought
wogan
was
not
blind
to
the
inspiriting
effect
of
his
argument
upon
maria
vittoria
he
had
however
foreseen
it
and
he
continued
imperturbably
no
doubt
you
think
me
something
of
a
fool
too
to
advance
so
unlikely
a
plea
but
if
her
highness
rejects
the
marriage
who
suffers
her
highness
name
is
already
widely
praised
for
her
endurance
her
constancy
if
after
all
at
the
last
moment
she
scornfully
rejects
that
for
which
she
has
so
stoutly
ventured
whose
name
whose
cause
will
suffer
most
it
will
be
one
more
misfortune
one
more
disaster
to
add
to
the
crushing
weight
under
which
the
king
labours
there
will
be
ignominy
who
will
be
dwarfed
by
it
there
will
be
laughter
whom
will
it
souse
there
will
be
scandal
who
will
be
splashed
by
it
the
princess
or
the
king
maria
vittoria
stood
with
her
brows
drawn
together
in
a
frown
i
will
not
go
she
said
after
a
pause
never
was
there
so
presumptuous
a
request
no
i
will
not
wogan
made
his
bow
and
retired
but
he
was
at
the
caprara
palace
again
in
the
morning
and
again
he
was
admitted
he
noticed
without
regret
that
maria
vittoria
bore
the
traces
of
a
restless
night
what
should
i
say
if
i
went
with
you
she
asked
you
would
say
why
the
king
lingers
in
spain
maria
vittoria
gave
a
startled
look
at
wogan
do
you
know
why
you
told
me
yesterday
not
in
words
there
are
other
ways
of
speech
that
one
smile
of
triumph
had
assured
wogan
that
the
king
delay
was
her
doing
and
a
condition
of
their
parting
how
will
my
story
though
i
told
it
help
asked
mlle
de
caprara
wogan
had
no
doubts
upon
that
score
the
story
of
the
chevalier
and
maria
vittoria
had
a
strong
parallel
in
clementina
own
history
circumstance
and
duty
held
them
apart
as
it
held
apart
clementina
and
wogan
himself
in
hearing
maria
vittoria
story
clementina
would
hear
her
own
she
must
be
moved
to
sympathy
with
it
she
would
regard
with
her
own
generous
eyes
those
who
played
unhappy
parts
in
its
development
she
could
have
no
word
of
censure
no
opportunity
for
scorn
tell
the
story
said
wogan
i
will
warrant
the
result
no
i
will
not
go
said
she
and
again
wogan
left
the
house
and
again
he
came
the
next
morning
why
should
i
go
said
maria
vittoria
rebelliously
say
what
you
have
said
to
me
to
her
speak
to
her
of
the
ignominy
which
will
befall
the
king
tell
her
how
his
cause
will
totter
why
talk
of
this
to
me
if
she
loves
the
king
your
words
will
persuade
her
for
on
my
life
they
have
nearly
persuaded
me
if
she
loves
the
king
said
wogan
quietly
and
maria
vittoria
stared
at
him
there
was
something
she
had
not
conjectured
before
oh
she
does
not
love
him
she
said
in
wonderment
her
wonderment
swiftly
changed
to
contempt
the
fool
let
her
go
on
her
knees
and
pray
for
a
modest
heart
there
my
message
to
her
who
is
she
that
she
should
not
love
him
but
it
nevertheless
altered
a
trifle
pleasurably
maria
vittoria
view
of
the
position
it
was
pain
to
her
to
contemplate
the
chevalier
marriage
a
deep
gnawing
rancorous
pain
but
the
pain
was
less
once
she
could
believe
he
was
to
marry
a
woman
who
did
not
love
him
she
despised
the
woman
for
her
stupidity
none
the
less
that
was
the
wife
she
would
choose
if
she
must
needs
choose
another
than
herself
i
have
a
mind
to
see
this
of
yours
she
said
doubtfully
why
does
she
not
love
the
king
wogan
could
have
answered
that
she
had
never
seen
him
he
thought
silence
however
was
the
more
expressive
the
silence
led
maria
vittoria
to
conjecture
is
there
another
picture
at
her
heart
she
asked
and
again
wogan
was
silent
whose
then
you
will
not
tell
me
it
might
have
been
something
in
wogan
attitude
or
face
which
revealed
the
truth
to
her
it
might
have
been
her
recollection
of
what
the
king
had
said
concerning
wogan
enthusiasm
it
might
have
been
merely
her
woman
instinct
but
she
started
and
took
a
step
towards
wogan
her
eyes
certainly
softened
i
will
go
with
you
to
bologna
she
said
and
that
afternoon
with
the
smallest
equipment
she
started
from
rome
wogan
had
ridden
alone
from
bologna
to
rome
in
four
days
he
had
spent
three
days
in
rome
he
now
took
six
days
to
return
in
company
with
mlle
de
caprara
and
her
few
servants
he
thus
arrived
in
bologna
on
the
eve
of
that
day
when
he
was
to
act
as
the
king
proxy
in
the
marriage
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
tiny
cavalcade
clattered
through
the
porta
castiglione
wogan
led
the
way
to
the
pilgrim
inn
where
he
left
maria
vittoria
saying
that
he
would
return
at
nightfall
he
then
went
on
foot
to
lodging
however
had
no
news
for
him
there
has
been
no
mysterious
visitor
said
he
there
will
be
one
answered
wogan
i
shall
need
you
i
am
ready
said
the
two
friends
walked
back
to
the
pilgrim
inn
they
were
joined
by
maria
vittoria
and
they
then
proceeded
to
the
little
house
among
the
trees
outside
the
door
in
the
garden
wall
wogan
posted
let
no
one
pass
said
he
till
we
return
he
knocked
on
the
door
and
after
a
little
delay
for
the
night
had
fallen
and
there
was
no
longer
a
porter
at
the
gate
a
little
hatch
was
opened
and
a
servant
inquired
his
business
i
come
with
a
message
of
the
utmost
importance
said
wogan
i
beg
you
to
inform
her
highness
that
the
chevalier
wogan
prays
for
two
words
with
her
the
hatch
was
closed
and
the
servant
footsteps
were
heard
to
retreat
wogan
anxieties
had
been
increasing
with
every
mile
of
that
homeward
journey
on
his
ride
to
rome
he
had
been
sensible
of
but
one
obstacle
the
difficulty
of
persuading
the
real
vittoria
to
return
with
him
but
once
that
had
been
removed
others
sprang
to
view
and
each
hour
enlarged
them
there
was
but
this
one
night
this
one
interview
upon
the
upshot
of
it
depended
whether
a
woman
destined
by
nature
for
a
queen
should
set
her
foot
upon
the
whether
a
cause
should
suffer
its
worst
of
many
eclipses
whether
europe
should
laugh
or
applaud
these
five
minutes
while
he
waited
outside
the
door
threw
him
into
a
fever
you
will
be
friendly
he
implored
mlle
de
caprara
oh
you
can
not
but
be
she
must
marry
the
king
i
plead
for
him
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
for
her
for
his
sake
she
must
complete
the
work
she
has
begun
she
is
not
obstinate
she
has
her
pride
as
a
woman
should
you
will
tell
her
just
the
truth
of
the
king
loyalty
and
yours
hearts
can
not
be
commanded
alas
mademoiselle
it
is
a
hard
world
at
the
end
of
it
it
is
mortised
with
the
blood
of
broken
hearts
but
duty
mademoiselle
duty
a
consciousness
of
rectitude
these
are
very
noble
qualities
it
will
be
a
high
consolation
mademoiselle
one
of
these
days
when
the
king
sits
upon
his
throne
in
england
to
think
that
your
had
set
him
there
and
wogan
hopped
like
a
bear
on
hot
bricks
twittering
irreproachable
sentiments
until
the
garden
door
was
opened
beyond
the
door
stretched
a
level
space
of
grass
intersected
by
a
gravel
path
along
this
path
the
servant
led
wogan
and
his
companion
into
the
house
there
were
lights
in
the
windows
on
the
upper
floor
and
a
small
lamp
illuminated
the
hall
but
the
lower
rooms
were
dark
the
servant
mounted
the
stairs
and
opening
the
door
of
a
little
library
announced
the
chevalier
wogan
wogan
led
his
companion
in
by
the
hand
your
highness
said
he
i
have
the
honour
to
present
to
you
the
princess
maria
vittoria
caprara
he
left
the
two
women
standing
opposite
to
and
measuring
each
other
silently
he
closed
the
door
and
went
down
stairs
into
the
hall
a
door
in
the
hall
opened
on
to
a
small
parlour
with
windows
giving
on
to
the
garden
there
once
before
lady
featherstone
and
harry
whittington
had
spoken
of
wogan
love
for
the
princess
clementina
and
speculated
upon
its
consequences
now
wogan
sat
there
alone
in
the
dark
listening
to
the
women
voices
overhead
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
efforts
and
could
only
wait
at
all
events
the
women
were
talking
that
was
something
if
he
could
only
hear
them
weeping
the
sound
of
tears
would
have
been
very
comforting
to
wogan
at
that
moment
but
he
only
heard
the
low
voices
talking
talking
he
assured
himself
over
and
over
again
that
this
meeting
could
not
fail
of
its
due
result
that
maria
vittoria
had
exacted
some
promise
which
held
his
king
in
spain
he
was
now
aware
she
would
say
what
that
promise
was
the
condition
of
their
parting
she
had
come
prepared
to
say
it
and
the
thread
of
wogan
reasonings
was
abruptly
cut
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
something
more
than
the
night
breeze
through
the
trees
a
sound
of
feet
upon
the
gravel
path
a
whispering
of
voices
the
windows
were
closed
but
not
shuttered
wogan
pressed
his
eyes
to
the
pane
and
looked
out
the
night
was
dark
and
the
sky
overclouded
but
he
had
been
sitting
for
some
minutes
in
the
darkness
and
his
eyes
were
able
to
prove
that
his
ears
had
not
deceived
him
for
he
saw
the
dim
figures
of
two
men
standing
on
the
lawn
before
the
window
they
appeared
to
be
looking
at
the
lighted
windows
on
the
upper
floor
then
one
of
them
waved
to
his
companion
to
stand
still
and
himself
walked
towards
the
door
wogan
noticed
that
he
made
no
attempt
at
secrecy
he
walked
with
a
firm
tread
careless
whether
he
set
his
foot
on
gravel
or
on
grass
as
this
man
approached
the
door
wogan
slipped
into
the
hall
and
opened
it
but
he
blocked
the
doorway
wondering
whether
these
men
had
climbed
the
wall
or
whether
had
deserted
his
post
had
not
deserted
his
post
but
he
had
none
the
less
admitted
these
two
men
for
wogan
and
maria
vittoria
had
barely
been
ten
minutes
within
the
house
when
heard
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
in
the
entrance
of
the
alley
they
stopped
just
within
the
entrance
distinguished
three
horses
he
saw
the
three
riders
dismount
and
while
one
of
the
three
held
the
horses
the
other
two
walked
on
foot
towards
the
eased
his
sword
in
its
scabbard
the
little
fellows
thought
to
catch
charles
wogan
napping
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
and
he
let
them
come
quite
close
to
him
he
was
standing
motionless
in
the
embrasure
of
the
door
nor
did
he
move
when
the
two
men
stopped
and
whispered
together
nor
when
they
advanced
again
one
behind
the
other
but
he
remarked
that
they
held
their
cloaks
to
their
faces
at
last
they
came
to
a
halt
just
in
front
of
the
leader
produced
a
key
you
stand
in
my
way
my
friend
said
he
pleasantly
and
he
pushed
by
to
the
lock
of
the
door
put
out
a
hand
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
and
sent
him
spinning
into
the
road
the
man
came
back
however
and
though
out
of
breath
spoke
no
less
pleasantly
than
before
i
wish
to
enter
said
he
i
have
important
business
bowed
with
the
utmost
dignity
civis
said
he
senator
too
latinam
linguam
amicus
drew
a
breath
he
could
not
but
feel
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
with
credit
he
half
began
to
regret
that
there
was
to
be
a
learned
professor
to
act
as
proxy
on
that
famous
day
at
the
capitol
his
antagonist
drew
back
a
little
and
spoke
no
longer
pleasantly
here
tomfoolery
that
would
be
as
seasonable
at
a
funeral
said
he
and
he
advanced
again
still
hiding
his
face
sir
you
are
blocking
my
way
i
have
authority
to
pass
through
that
door
in
the
wall
asked
he
shook
his
head
in
refusal
and
by
what
right
do
you
refuse
me
had
an
inspiration
he
swept
his
arm
proudly
round
and
gave
the
reason
of
his
refusal
aedificabat
said
he
and
a
voice
that
made
start
cried
enough
of
this
stand
aside
whoever
you
may
be
it
was
the
second
of
the
two
men
who
spoke
and
he
dropped
the
cloak
from
his
face
the
king
exclaimed
and
he
stood
aside
the
two
men
passed
into
the
garden
and
wogan
saw
them
from
the
window
just
as
had
blocked
the
king
entrance
into
the
garden
so
did
wogan
bar
his
way
into
the
house
who
in
heaven
name
are
you
cried
the
chevalier
nay
there
a
question
for
me
to
ask
said
wogan
wogan
cried
the
chevalier
and
the
king
cried
wogan
in
one
breath
wogan
fell
back
the
chevalier
pushed
into
the
hall
and
turned
so
it
is
true
i
could
not
did
not
believe
it
i
came
from
spain
to
prove
it
false
i
find
it
true
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
whom
i
so
trusted
god
help
me
where
shall
i
look
for
honour
here
your
majesty
answered
wogan
without
an
hesitation
here
in
this
hall
there
in
the
rooms
above
he
had
seized
the
truth
in
the
same
second
when
he
recognised
his
king
and
the
king
first
words
had
left
him
in
no
doubt
he
knew
now
why
he
had
never
found
harry
whittington
in
any
corner
of
bologna
harry
whittington
had
been
riding
to
spain
the
chevalier
laughed
harshly
sir
i
suspect
honour
which
needs
such
barriers
to
protect
it
you
are
here
in
this
house
at
this
hour
with
a
sentinel
to
forbid
intrusion
at
the
garden
door
explain
me
this
honourably
i
had
the
honour
to
escort
a
visitor
to
her
highness
and
i
wait
until
the
visit
is
at
an
end
what
can
you
not
better
that
excuse
said
the
chevalier
a
visitor
we
will
make
acquaintance
wogan
with
your
visitor
unless
you
have
another
sentinel
to
bar
my
way
and
he
put
his
foot
upon
the
step
of
the
stairs
i
beg
your
majesty
to
pause
said
wogan
firmly
your
thoughts
wrong
me
and
not
only
me
prove
me
that
i
say
boldly
is
a
servant
who
loves
his
queen
what
then
this
that
you
should
say
is
a
man
who
loves
a
woman
loves
her
so
well
he
gives
his
friends
the
slip
and
with
the
woman
comes
alone
to
peri
ah
to
peri
so
i
thought
began
wogan
and
the
chevalier
whispered
silence
you
raise
your
voice
too
high
you
no
doubt
are
anxious
in
your
great
respect
that
there
should
be
some
intimation
of
my
coming
but
i
dispense
with
ceremony
i
will
meet
this
fine
visitor
of
yours
at
once
and
he
ran
lightly
up
the
stairs
then
wogan
did
a
bold
thing
he
followed
he
sprang
past
the
king
he
turned
at
the
and
barred
the
way
sir
i
beg
you
to
listen
to
me
he
said
quietly
beg
said
the
chevalier
leaning
back
against
the
wall
with
his
dark
eyes
blazing
from
a
white
face
you
insist
your
majesty
will
yet
thank
me
for
my
insistence
he
drew
a
out
of
his
coat
at
peri
in
italy
we
were
attacked
by
five
soldiers
sent
over
the
border
by
the
governor
of
trent
who
guided
those
five
soldiers
your
majesty
confidant
and
friend
who
is
now
i
thank
god
waiting
in
the
garden
here
is
the
written
confession
of
the
leader
of
the
five
i
pray
your
majesty
to
read
it
wogan
held
out
the
paper
the
chevalier
hesitated
and
took
it
then
he
read
it
once
and
glanced
at
it
again
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
whom
shall
i
trust
said
he
in
a
voice
of
weariness
what
honest
errand
was
taking
whittington
to
peri
asked
wogan
and
again
the
chevalier
read
a
piece
here
and
there
of
the
confession
wogan
pressed
his
advantage
whittington
is
not
the
only
one
of
walpole
men
who
has
hoodwinked
us
the
while
he
filled
his
pockets
there
are
others
one
at
all
events
who
did
not
need
to
travel
to
spain
for
an
ear
to
poison
and
he
leaned
forward
towards
the
chevalier
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
chevalier
in
a
startled
voice
why
sir
that
the
same
sort
of
venomous
story
breathed
to
you
in
spain
has
been
spoken
here
in
bologna
only
with
altered
names
i
told
your
majesty
i
brought
a
visitor
to
this
house
i
did
there
was
no
need
i
should
since
the
marriage
is
fixed
for
i
brought
her
all
the
way
from
rome
from
rome
exclaimed
the
chevalier
yes
and
wogan
flung
open
the
door
of
the
library
and
drawing
himself
up
announced
in
his
loudest
voice
the
king
a
loud
cry
came
through
the
opening
it
was
not
clementina
voice
which
uttered
it
the
chevalier
recognised
the
cry
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
looking
at
wogan
then
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
wogan
closed
the
door
behind
him
but
as
he
closed
it
he
heard
maria
vittoria
speak
she
said
your
majesty
a
long
while
ago
when
you
bade
me
farewell
i
demanded
of
you
a
promise
which
i
have
but
this
moment
explained
to
the
princess
who
now
deigns
to
call
me
friend
your
majesty
has
broken
the
promise
i
had
no
right
to
demand
it
i
am
very
glad
wogan
went
downstairs
he
could
leave
the
three
of
them
shut
up
in
that
room
to
come
by
a
fitting
understanding
besides
there
was
other
work
for
him
below
work
of
a
simple
kind
to
which
he
had
now
for
some
weeks
looked
forward
he
crept
down
the
stairs
very
stealthily
the
hall
door
was
still
open
he
could
see
dimly
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
on
the
grass
when
the
chevalier
came
down
into
the
garden
an
hour
afterwards
a
man
was
still
standing
on
the
grass
the
man
advanced
to
him
who
is
it
asked
the
chevalier
drawing
back
the
voice
which
answered
him
was
wogan
and
whittington
he
has
gone
replied
wogan
you
have
sent
him
away
i
took
so
much
upon
myself
the
chevalier
held
out
his
hand
to
wogan
i
have
good
reason
to
thank
you
said
he
and
before
he
could
say
another
word
a
door
shut
above
and
maria
vittoria
came
down
the
stairs
towards
them
was
still
standing
sentry
at
the
and
the
three
men
escorted
the
princess
caprara
to
the
pilgrim
inn
she
had
spoken
no
word
during
the
walk
but
as
she
turned
in
the
doorway
of
the
inn
the
light
struck
upon
her
face
and
showed
that
her
eyes
glistened
to
the
chevalier
she
said
i
wish
you
my
lord
all
happiness
and
the
boon
of
a
great
love
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
it
and
as
he
bowed
over
her
hand
she
looked
across
his
shoulder
to
wogan
i
will
bid
you
farewell
she
said
with
a
smile
and
the
chevalier
explained
her
saying
afterwards
as
they
accompanied
him
to
his
lodging
mlle
de
caprara
will
honour
us
with
her
presence
you
will
still
act
as
my
proxy
wogan
i
am
not
yet
returned
from
spain
i
wish
no
questions
or
talk
about
this
evening
doings
your
friend
will
remember
that
my
friend
sir
said
wogan
who
was
with
me
at
innspruck
is
captain
lucius
of
dillon
regiment
senator
too
said
the
chevalier
with
a
laugh
and
he
added
a
friendly
word
or
two
which
sent
back
to
his
lodging
in
a
high
pleasure
wogan
walked
thither
with
him
and
held
out
his
hand
at
the
door
but
you
will
come
up
with
me
said
we
will
drink
a
glass
together
for
god
knows
when
we
speak
together
again
i
go
back
to
schlestadt
ah
you
go
back
said
wogan
and
he
came
in
at
the
door
and
mounted
the
stairs
at
the
first
landing
he
stopped
let
me
rouse
gaydon
gaydon
went
three
days
ago
ah
and
misset
is
with
his
wife
here
are
we
all
once
more
scattered
and
as
you
say
god
knows
when
we
shall
speak
together
again
and
he
went
on
to
the
upper
storey
remarked
that
he
dragged
in
his
walk
and
that
his
voice
had
a
strange
sad
note
of
melancholy
my
friend
said
he
you
have
the
black
fit
upon
you
you
are
plainly
discouraged
yet
sees
the
labour
of
many
months
brought
to
its
due
close
and
as
he
lit
the
candles
on
his
chimney
he
was
quite
amazed
by
the
white
tired
face
which
the
light
showed
to
him
wogan
indeed
harassed
by
misgivings
and
worn
with
many
vigils
presented
a
sufficiently
picture
the
effect
was
heightened
by
the
disorder
of
his
clothes
which
were
all
daubed
with
clay
in
a
manner
quite
surprising
to
who
knew
the
ground
to
be
dry
underfoot
true
answered
wogan
the
work
ends
months
ago
i
rode
down
this
street
in
the
early
morning
and
with
what
high
hopes
the
work
ends
and
may
god
forgive
me
for
a
meddlesome
fellow
cup
and
ball
a
fine
game
but
it
is
ill
playing
it
with
women
hearts
and
he
broke
off
suddenly
i
give
you
a
toast
lucius
here
to
the
princess
clementina
and
draining
his
glass
he
stood
for
a
while
lost
in
the
recollecting
of
that
flight
from
innspruck
he
was
far
away
from
bologna
thundering
down
the
brenner
through
the
night
with
the
sparks
striking
from
the
wheels
of
the
berlin
and
all
about
him
a
glimmering
shapeless
waste
of
snow
to
the
princess
no
to
the
queen
she
was
born
to
be
cried
and
wogan
sprang
at
him
you
saw
that
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
lighting
his
face
transfigured
in
the
intensity
of
this
moment
relief
aye
to
love
a
nation
that
is
her
high
destiny
for
others
a
husband
a
man
for
her
a
nation
and
you
saw
it
it
is
evident
to
be
sure
yet
this
or
that
thing
she
did
this
or
that
word
she
spoke
assured
you
eh
tell
me
what
proved
to
you
here
was
no
mere
woman
but
a
queen
the
morning
had
dawned
before
wogan
had
had
his
fill
was
very
well
content
to
see
his
friend
face
once
more
quivering
like
a
with
pleasure
to
hear
him
laugh
to
watch
the
despondency
vanish
from
his
aspect
there
another
piece
of
good
news
he
said
at
the
end
which
i
had
almost
forgotten
to
tell
you
jenny
and
the
mother
are
happily
set
free
it
seems
jenny
swore
from
daybreak
to
daybreak
and
the
pope
used
his
kindliest
offices
and
for
those
two
reasons
the
emperor
was
glad
to
let
them
go
but
there
a
question
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
little
matter
puzzles
me
ask
your
question
said
wogan
through
that
door
in
the
garden
wall
which
i
guarded
there
went
in
yourself
and
a
lady
the
king
and
a
companion
he
had
with
him
four
people
out
of
that
door
there
came
yourself
the
lady
and
the
king
three
people
ah
said
wogan
as
he
stood
up
with
a
strange
smile
upon
his
lips
i
have
a
deal
of
clay
upon
my
clothes
nodded
his
head
wisely
once
or
twice
i
am
answered
he
said
is
it
indeed
so
he
understood
however
nothing
except
that
the
room
had
suddenly
grown
cold
chapter
xxv
an
account
remains
of
the
marriage
ceremony
which
took
place
the
next
morning
in
cardinal
origo
house
it
was
of
the
simplest
kind
and
was
witnessed
by
few
murray
misset
and
his
wife
and
maria
vittoria
de
caprara
made
the
public
part
of
the
company
wogan
stood
for
the
king
and
the
marquis
of
monti
boulorois
for
james
sobieski
the
father
bride
and
bridegroom
played
their
parts
bravely
and
well
one
must
believe
for
the
chronicler
speaks
of
their
grace
and
modesty
of
bearing
clementina
rose
at
five
in
the
morning
dressed
in
a
robe
of
white
tied
a
white
ribbon
about
her
hair
and
for
her
only
ornament
fixed
a
white
collar
of
pearls
about
her
neck
in
this
garb
she
went
at
once
to
the
church
of
san
domenico
where
she
made
her
confession
and
from
the
church
to
the
cardinal
palace
there
the
cardinal
with
one
maas
an
english
priest
from
rome
at
his
elbow
was
already
waiting
for
her
wogan
thereupon
read
the
procuration
for
which
he
had
ridden
to
rome
in
haste
so
many
months
before
and
pronounced
the
consent
of
the
king
his
master
to
its
terms
origo
asked
the
princess
whether
she
likewise
consented
and
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
her
one
word
yes
seems
to
have
stirred
the
historian
to
pæans
it
seems
that
all
the
virtues
launched
that
one
little
word
and
were
clearly
expressed
in
it
the
graces
too
for
once
in
a
way
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
virtues
never
was
a
yes
so
sweetly
spoken
since
the
earth
rose
out
of
the
sea
in
a
word
there
was
no
ruffle
of
the
great
passion
which
these
two
man
and
woman
had
trodden
beneath
their
feet
she
did
not
hint
of
iphigenia
he
borrowed
no
plumes
from
don
quixote
nor
need
one
fancy
that
their
contentment
was
all
counterfeit
they
were
neither
of
them
grumblers
and
fate
and
destiny
were
words
seldom
upon
their
lips
one
incident
indeed
is
related
which
the
chronicler
thought
to
be
curious
though
he
did
not
comprehend
it
the
princess
clementina
brought
from
her
confessional
box
a
wisp
of
straw
which
clung
to
her
dress
at
the
knee
until
wogan
had
placed
the
king
ring
upon
her
finger
she
did
not
apparently
remark
it
but
no
sooner
had
that
office
been
performed
than
she
stooped
and
with
a
friendly
smile
at
her
makeshift
bridegroom
she
plucked
it
from
her
skirt
and
let
it
fall
beneath
her
foot
and
that
was
all
no
words
passed
between
them
after
the
ceremony
for
her
royal
highness
went
straight
back
to
the
little
house
in
the
garden
and
that
same
forenoon
set
out
for
rome
she
was
not
the
only
witness
of
the
ceremony
to
take
that
road
that
day
for
some
three
hours
later
to
be
precise
at
two
maria
vittoria
stepped
into
her
coach
before
the
pilgrim
inn
wogan
held
the
carriage
door
open
for
her
he
was
still
in
the
bravery
of
his
wedding
clothes
and
maria
vittoria
looked
him
over
whimsically
from
the
top
of
his
peruke
to
his
i
came
to
see
a
said
she
and
i
saw
a
well
well
and
she
suddenly
lowered
her
voice
to
a
passionate
whisper
why
oh
why
did
you
not
take
your
fortunes
in
your
hands
at
peri
wogan
leaned
forward
to
her
do
you
know
so
much
she
answered
him
quickly
i
will
never
forgive
you
yes
i
know
she
forced
her
lips
into
a
smile
i
suppose
you
are
content
you
have
your
black
horse
you
know
of
the
horse
too
said
wogan
colouring
to
the
edge
of
his
peruke
you
know
i
have
no
further
use
for
it
say
that
again
and
i
will
beg
it
of
you
nay
it
is
yours
then
i
will
send
him
after
you
to
rome
will
you
said
maria
vittoria
why
then
i
accept
there
my
hand
and
she
thrust
it
through
the
window
to
him
if
ever
you
come
to
rome
the
caprara
palace
stands
where
it
did
at
your
last
visit
i
do
not
say
you
will
be
welcome
no
i
do
not
forgive
you
but
you
may
come
having
your
horse
i
could
hardly
bar
the
door
against
you
so
you
may
come
wogan
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
aye
said
she
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
kiss
my
hand
you
have
had
your
way
here
are
two
people
crossmated
and
two
others
not
mated
at
all
you
have
made
four
people
entirely
unhappy
and
a
kiss
on
the
glove
sets
all
right
nay
not
four
protested
wogan
your
manners
she
continued
remorselessly
ticking
off
the
names
upon
her
fingers
will
hinder
you
from
telling
me
to
my
face
the
king
is
happy
and
the
princess
she
was
born
to
be
a
queen
replied
wogan
stubbornly
happiness
mademoiselle
it
does
not
come
by
the
striving
after
it
that
the
royal
road
to
miss
it
you
may
build
up
your
house
of
happiness
with
all
your
care
through
years
and
you
will
find
you
have
only
built
it
up
to
draw
down
the
blinds
and
hang
out
the
hatchment
above
the
door
for
the
tenant
to
inhabit
it
is
dead
maria
vittoria
listened
very
seriously
till
he
came
to
the
end
then
she
made
a
pouting
grimace
that
is
very
fine
moral
and
poetical
your
princess
was
born
to
be
a
queen
but
what
if
her
throne
is
set
up
only
in
your
city
of
dreams
well
it
is
some
consolation
to
know
that
you
are
one
of
the
four
nay
i
will
make
a
shift
not
to
plague
myself
upon
the
way
the
world
treats
you
ah
but
because
it
treats
you
well
cried
she
there
will
be
work
for
you
hurryings
to
and
fro
the
opportunities
of
excelling
nights
in
the
saddle
and
perhaps
again
the
quick
red
life
of
battlefields
it
is
well
with
you
but
what
of
me
wogan
what
of
me
and
she
leaned
back
in
her
carriage
and
drove
away
wogan
had
no
answer
to
that
despairing
question
he
stood
with
his
head
bared
till
the
carriage
passed
round
a
corner
and
disappeared
but
the
voice
rang
for
a
long
while
in
his
ears
and
for
a
long
while
the
dark
eyes
abrim
with
tears
and
the
tortured
face
kept
him
company
at
nights
he
walked
slowly
back
to
his
lodging
and
mounting
a
horse
rode
out
of
bologna
and
towards
the
apennines
on
one
of
the
lower
slopes
he
came
upon
a
villa
just
beyond
a
curve
of
the
road
and
reined
in
his
horse
the
villa
nestled
on
the
hillside
below
him
in
a
terraced
garden
of
oleander
and
magnolias
very
pretty
to
the
eye
cypress
hedges
enclosed
it
the
spring
had
made
it
a
bower
of
rose
blossoms
and
depths
of
shade
out
of
whose
green
darkness
glowed
here
and
there
a
red
statue
like
a
tutelary
god
wogan
dismounted
and
led
his
horse
down
the
path
to
the
door
he
inquired
for
lady
featherstone
and
was
shown
into
a
room
from
the
windows
of
which
he
looked
down
on
bologna
that
city
of
colonnades
lady
featherstone
however
had
heard
the
tramp
of
his
horse
she
came
running
up
from
the
garden
and
without
waiting
to
hear
any
particulars
of
her
visitor
burst
eagerly
into
the
room
well
she
said
and
stopped
and
swayed
upon
the
threshold
wogan
turned
from
the
window
towards
her
your
ladyship
was
wise
i
think
to
leave
bologna
the
little
house
in
the
trees
there
had
no
such
wide
prospect
as
this
he
spoke
rather
to
give
her
time
than
out
of
any
sarcasm
she
set
a
hand
against
the
jamb
of
the
door
and
even
so
barely
sustained
her
trifling
weight
her
knees
shook
her
childlike
face
grew
white
as
paper
a
great
terror
glittered
in
her
eyes
i
am
not
the
visitor
whom
you
expect
continued
wogan
nor
do
i
bring
the
news
which
you
would
wish
to
hear
and
at
that
she
raised
a
trembling
hand
i
beg
you
a
moment
silence
then
i
will
hear
you
mr
warner
she
made
a
sort
of
stumbling
run
and
reached
a
couch
wogan
shut
the
door
and
waited
he
was
glad
that
she
had
used
the
name
of
warner
it
recalled
to
him
that
evening
at
ohlau
when
she
had
stood
behind
the
curtain
with
a
stiletto
in
her
hand
and
the
three
last
days
of
his
perilous
ride
to
schlestadt
he
needed
his
most
vivid
recollections
to
steel
his
heart
against
her
for
he
was
beginning
to
think
it
was
his
weary
lot
to
go
up
and
down
the
world
causing
pain
to
women
after
a
while
she
said
now
your
news
and
she
held
her
hand
lightly
to
her
heart
to
await
the
blow
the
king
married
this
morning
the
princess
clementina
said
wogan
lady
featherstone
did
not
move
her
hand
she
still
waited
it
was
just
to
hinder
this
marriage
that
she
had
come
to
italy
but
her
failure
was
at
this
moment
of
no
account
she
heard
of
it
with
indifference
it
had
no
meaning
to
her
she
waited
wogan
mere
presence
at
the
villa
told
her
there
was
more
to
come
he
continued
last
night
whittington
came
with
the
king
to
bologna
you
understand
no
doubt
why
and
she
nodded
without
moving
her
eyes
from
his
face
she
made
no
pretence
as
to
the
part
she
had
played
in
the
affair
all
the
world
might
know
it
that
was
a
matter
at
this
moment
of
complete
indifference
she
waited
the
king
and
whittington
came
at
nine
of
the
night
to
the
little
house
which
you
once
occupied
i
was
there
but
i
was
not
there
alone
can
your
ladyship
conjecture
whom
i
brought
there
your
ladyship
as
i
learned
last
night
from
whittington
own
lips
had
paid
a
visit
secretly
using
a
key
which
you
had
retained
to
the
house
on
an
excuse
that
you
had
left
behind
jewels
of
some
value
you
saw
her
highness
the
princess
you
told
her
a
story
of
the
king
and
mlle
de
caprara
i
rode
to
rome
and
when
the
king
came
last
night
mlle
de
caprara
was
with
the
princess
i
had
evidence
against
whittington
a
confession
of
one
of
the
soldiers
of
the
governor
of
trent
the
leader
of
a
party
of
five
who
attacked
me
at
peri
no
doubt
you
know
of
that
little
matter
too
and
again
lady
featherstone
nodded
thus
your
double
plot
to
set
the
king
against
the
princess
and
the
princess
against
the
king
doubly
failed
go
on
said
lady
featherstone
moistening
her
dry
lips
wogan
told
her
how
from
the
little
on
the
he
had
seen
the
king
and
whittington
cross
the
lawn
he
described
his
interview
with
the
king
and
how
he
had
come
quietly
down
the
stairs
i
went
into
the
garden
he
went
on
and
touched
whittington
on
the
elbow
i
told
him
just
what
i
have
explained
to
you
i
said
are
a
coward
a
liar
a
slanderer
of
women
and
i
beat
him
on
the
mouth
lady
featherstone
uttered
a
cry
and
drew
herself
into
an
extraordinary
crouching
attitude
with
her
eyes
blazing
steadily
at
him
he
thought
she
meant
to
spring
at
him
he
looked
at
that
hand
upon
her
heart
to
see
whether
it
held
a
weapon
hidden
in
the
fold
of
her
bosom
go
on
she
said
and
he
he
answered
me
in
the
strangest
quiet
way
imaginable
insulted
lady
featherstone
at
ohlau
wogan
said
he
evening
when
she
hid
behind
your
curtain
it
was
a
very
delicate
piece
of
drollery
no
doubt
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
show
you
another
view
of
it
it
is
strange
how
that
had
rankled
in
his
thoughts
i
liked
him
for
it
upon
my
soul
i
did
though
it
was
the
only
thing
i
liked
in
him
go
on
said
lady
featherstone
wogan
likes
or
dislikes
were
of
no
more
interest
to
her
than
the
failure
of
her
effort
to
hinder
the
marriage
we
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
where
there
is
a
little
square
of
lawn
hedged
in
with
the
night
was
very
dark
so
we
stripped
to
our
shirts
from
the
waist
upwards
we
were
visible
to
each
other
as
a
vague
glimmer
of
white
and
thus
we
fought
foot
to
foot
among
the
we
could
not
see
so
much
as
our
swords
unless
they
clashed
more
than
usually
hard
and
a
spark
struck
from
them
we
fought
by
guesswork
and
feel
and
in
the
end
luck
served
me
i
drove
my
sword
through
his
chest
until
the
hilt
rang
upon
his
then
just
a
movement
from
lady
featherstone
as
though
she
drew
up
her
feet
beneath
her
he
lived
for
perhaps
five
minutes
he
was
in
great
distress
lest
harm
should
come
to
you
and
since
there
was
no
one
but
his
enemy
to
whom
he
could
speak
why
he
spoke
to
his
enemy
i
promised
him
madam
that
with
his
death
the
story
should
be
closed
if
you
left
italy
within
the
week
and
he
she
interrupted
he
died
there
well
you
know
the
laurel
hedge
by
the
there
is
an
where
the
gardener
keeps
his
tools
i
found
a
spade
there
and
beneath
that
laurel
hedge
i
buried
him
lady
featherstone
rose
to
her
feet
she
spoke
no
word
she
uttered
no
cry
her
face
was
white
and
terrible
she
stood
rigid
like
one
paralysed
then
she
swayed
round
and
fell
in
a
swoon
upon
the
floor
and
as
she
fell
something
bright
slipped
from
her
hand
and
dropped
at
wogan
feet
he
picked
it
up
it
was
a
stiletto
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
childish
figure
with
a
queer
compassionate
smile
upon
his
face
she
could
love
said
he
yes
she
could
love
he
walked
out
of
the
house
led
his
horse
back
onto
the
road
and
mounted
it
the
night
was
gathering
there
were
purple
shadows
upon
the
apennines
wogan
rode
away
alone
epilogue
sir
charles
wogan
had
opportunities
enough
to
appreciate
in
later
years
the
accuracy
of
maria
vittoria
prophecy
here
are
two
people
said
she
and
events
bore
her
out
the
jealousies
of
courtiers
no
doubt
had
their
share
in
the
estrangement
of
that
unhappy
couple
but
that
was
no
consolation
to
wogan
who
saw
within
so
short
a
time
of
that
journey
into
italy
james
separated
from
the
chosen
woman
and
the
chosen
woman
herself
seeking
the
seclusion
of
a
convent
as
his
reward
he
was
made
governor
of
la
mancha
in
spain
and
no
place
could
have
been
found

lived
for
many
years
writing
a
deal
of
latin

upon

of
the

matters
of

left

ride
on
his

horse
into
his
city
of

he
lived
and
died
a

the
memory
of
that
week
when
he
had
rescued
his
princess
and
carried
her
through
the
snows
was
to
the
last
too
vivid
in
his
thoughts
the
thunderous
roll
of
the
carriage
down
the
slopes
the
sparks
striking
from
the
wheels
the
sound
of
clementina
voice
singing
softly
in
the
darkness
of
the

the

coming
of
the

about
that

the
world

gone
awry
