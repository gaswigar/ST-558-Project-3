the
majesty
of
calmness
calmness
is
the
rarest
quality
in
human
life
it
is
the
poise
of
a
great
nature
in
harmony
with
itself
and
its
ideals
it
is
the
moral
atmosphere
of
a
life
and
calmness
is
singleness
of
purpose
absolute
confidence
and
conscious
power
ready
to
be
focused
in
an
instant
to
meet
any
crisis
the
sphinx
is
not
a
true
type
of
calmness
petrifaction
is
not
calmness
it
is
death
the
silencing
of
all
the
energies
while
no
one
lives
his
life
more
fully
more
intensely
and
more
consciously
than
the
man
who
is
calm
the
fatalist
is
not
calm
he
is
the
coward
slave
of
his
environment
hopelessly
surrendering
to
his
present
condition
recklessly
indifferent
to
his
future
he
accepts
his
life
as
a
rudderless
ship
drifting
on
the
ocean
of
time
he
has
no
compass
no
chart
no
known
port
to
which
he
is
sailing
his
inferiority
to
all
nature
is
shown
in
his
existence
of
constant
surrender
it
is
not
calmness
the
man
who
is
calm
has
his
course
in
life
clearly
marked
on
his
chart
his
hand
is
ever
on
the
helm
storm
fog
night
tempest
danger
hidden
reefs
he
is
ever
prepared
and
ready
for
them
he
is
made
calm
and
serene
by
the
realization
that
in
these
crises
of
his
voyage
he
needs
a
clear
mind
and
a
cool
head
that
he
has
naught
to
do
but
to
do
each
day
the
best
he
can
by
the
light
he
has
that
he
will
never
flinch
nor
falter
for
a
moment
that
though
he
may
have
to
tack
and
leave
his
course
for
a
time
he
will
never
drift
he
will
get
back
into
the
true
channel
he
will
keep
ever
headed
toward
his
harbor
he
will
reach
it
he
will
reach
it
matters
not
to
him
he
rests
in
calmness
knowing
he
has
done
his
best
if
his
best
seem
to
be
overthrown
or
overruled
then
he
must
still
bow
his
head
in
calmness
to
no
man
is
permitted
to
know
the
future
of
his
life
the
finality
god
commits
to
man
ever
only
new
beginnings
new
wisdom
and
new
days
to
use
the
best
of
his
knowledge
calmness
comes
ever
from
within
it
is
the
peace
and
restfulness
of
the
depths
of
our
nature
the
fury
of
storm
and
of
wind
agitate
only
the
surface
of
the
sea
they
can
penetrate
only
two
or
three
hundred
feet
below
that
is
the
calm
unruffled
deep
to
be
ready
for
the
great
crises
of
life
we
must
learn
serenity
in
our
daily
living
calmness
is
the
crown
of
when
the
worries
and
cares
of
the
day
fret
you
and
begin
to
wear
upon
you
and
you
chafe
under
the
friction
be
calm
stop
rest
for
a
moment
and
let
calmness
and
peace
assert
themselves
if
you
let
these
irritating
outside
influences
get
the
better
of
you
you
are
confessing
your
inferiority
to
them
by
permitting
them
to
dominate
you
study
the
disturbing
elements
each
by
itself
bring
all
the
will
power
of
your
nature
to
bear
upon
them
and
you
will
find
that
they
will
one
by
one
melt
into
nothingness
like
vapors
fading
before
the
sun
the
glow
of
calmness
that
will
then
pervade
your
mind
the
tingling
sensation
of
an
inflow
of
new
strength
may
be
to
you
the
beginning
of
the
revelation
of
the
supreme
calmness
that
is
possible
for
you
then
in
some
great
hour
of
your
life
when
you
stand
face
to
face
with
some
awful
trial
when
the
structure
of
your
ambition
and
crumbles
in
a
moment
you
will
be
brave
you
can
then
fold
your
arms
calmly
look
out
undismayed
and
undaunted
upon
the
ashes
of
your
hope
upon
the
wreck
of
what
you
have
faithfully
built
and
with
brave
heart
and
unfaltering
voice
you
may
say
so
let
it
be
i
will
build
again
when
the
tongue
of
malice
and
slander
the
persecution
of
inferiority
tempts
you
for
just
a
moment
to
retaliate
when
for
an
instant
you
forget
yourself
so
far
as
to
hunger
for
revenge
be
calm
when
the
grey
heron
is
pursued
by
its
enemy
the
eagle
it
does
not
run
to
escape
it
remains
calm
takes
a
dignified
stand
and
waits
quietly
facing
the
enemy
unmoved
with
the
terrific
force
with
which
the
eagle
makes
its
attack
the
boasted
king
of
birds
is
often
impaled
and
run
through
on
the
quiet
bill
of
the
heron
the
means
that
man
takes
to
kill
another
character
becomes
suicide
of
his
own
no
man
in
the
world
ever
attempted
to
wrong
another
without
being
injured
in
return
someway
somehow
sometime
the
only
weapon
of
offence
that
nature
seems
to
recognize
is
the
boomerang
nature
keeps
her
books
admirably
she
puts
down
every
item
she
closes
all
accounts
finally
but
she
does
not
always
balance
them
at
the
end
of
the
month
to
the
man
who
is
calm
revenge
is
so
far
beneath
him
that
he
can
not
reach
it
even
by
stooping
when
injured
he
does
not
retaliate
he
wraps
around
him
the
royal
robes
of
calmness
and
he
goes
quietly
on
his
way
when
the
hand
of
death
touches
the
one
we
hold
dearest
paralyzes
our
energy
and
eclipses
the
sun
of
our
life
the
calmness
that
has
been
accumulating
in
long
years
becomes
in
a
moment
our
refuge
our
reserve
strength
the
most
subtle
of
all
temptations
is
the
success
of
the
wicked
it
requires
moral
courage
to
see
without
flinching
material
prosperity
coming
to
men
who
are
dishonest
to
see
politicians
rise
into
prominence
power
and
wealth
by
trickery
and
corruption
to
see
virtue
in
rags
and
vice
in
velvets
to
see
ignorance
at
a
premium
and
knowledge
at
a
discount
to
the
man
who
is
really
calm
these
puzzles
of
life
do
not
appeal
he
is
living
his
life
as
best
he
can
he
is
not
worrying
about
the
problems
of
justice
whose
solution
must
be
left
to
omniscience
to
solve
when
man
has
developed
the
spirit
of
calmness
until
it
becomes
so
absolutely
part
of
him
that
his
very
presence
radiates
it
he
has
made
great
progress
in
life
calmness
can
not
be
acquired
of
itself
and
by
itself
it
must
come
as
the
culmination
of
a
series
of
virtues
what
the
world
needs
and
what
individuals
need
is
a
higher
standard
of
living
a
great
realizing
sense
of
the
privilege
and
dignity
of
life
a
higher
and
nobler
conception
of
individuality
with
this
great
sense
of
calmness
permeating
an
individual
man
becomes
able
to
retire
more
into
himself
away
from
the
noise
the
confusion
and
strife
of
the
world
which
come
to
his
ears
only
as
faint
rumblings
or
as
the
tumult
of
the
life
of
a
city
heard
only
as
a
buzzing
hum
by
the
man
in
a
balloon
the
man
who
is
calm
does
not
selfishly
isolate
himself
from
the
world
for
he
is
intensely
interested
in
all
that
concerns
the
welfare
of
humanity
his
calmness
is
but
a
holy
of
holies
into
which
he
can
retire
the
world
to
get
strength
to
live
the
world
he
realizes
that
the
full
glory
of
individuality
the
crowning
of
his
is
the
majesty
of
calmness
ii
hurry
the
scourge
of
america
the
first
sermon
in
the
world
was
preached
at
the
creation
it
was
a
divine
protest
against
hurry
it
was
a
divine
object
lesson
of
perfect
law
perfect
plan
perfect
order
perfect
method
six
days
of
work
carefully
planned
scheduled
and
completed
were
followed
by
rest
whether
we
accept
the
story
as
literal
or
as
figurative
as
the
account
of
successive
days
or
of
ages
comprising
millions
of
years
matters
little
if
we
but
learn
the
lesson
nature
is
very
nature
never
hurries
every
phase
of
her
working
shows
plan
calmness
reliability
and
the
absence
of
hurry
hurry
always
implies
lack
of
definite
method
confusion
impatience
of
slow
growth
the
tower
of
babel
the
world
first
skyscraper
was
a
failure
because
of
hurry
the
workers
mistook
their
arrogant
ambition
for
inspiration
they
had
too
many
builders
and
no
architect
they
thought
to
make
up
the
lack
of
a
head
by
a
superfluity
of
hands
this
is
a
characteristic
of
hurry
it
seeks
ever
to
make
energy
a
substitute
for
a
clearly
defined
plan
the
result
is
ever
as
hopeless
as
trying
to
transform
a
into
a
real
steed
by
brisk
riding
hurry
is
a
counterfeit
of
haste
haste
has
an
ideal
a
distinct
aim
to
be
realized
by
the
quickest
direct
methods
haste
has
a
single
compass
upon
which
it
relies
for
direction
and
in
harmony
with
which
its
course
is
determined
hurry
says
i
must
move
faster
i
will
get
three
compasses
i
will
have
them
different
i
will
be
guided
by
all
of
them
one
of
them
will
probably
be
right
hurry
never
realizes
that
slow
careful
foundation
work
is
the
quickest
in
the
end
hurry
has
ruined
more
americans
than
has
any
other
word
in
the
vocabulary
of
life
it
is
the
scourge
of
america
and
is
both
a
cause
and
a
result
of
our
civilization
hurry
adroitly
assumes
so
many
masquerades
of
disguise
that
its
identity
is
not
always
recognized
hurry
always
pays
the
highest
price
for
everything
and
usually
the
goods
are
not
delivered
in
the
race
for
wealth
men
often
sacrifice
time
energy
health
home
happiness
and
honor
everything
that
money
can
not
buy
the
very
things
that
money
can
never
bring
back
hurry
is
a
phantom
of
paradoxes
business
men
in
their
desire
to
provide
for
the
future
happiness
of
their
family
often
sacrifice
the
present
happiness
of
wife
and
children
on
the
altar
of
hurry
they
forget
that
their
place
in
the
home
should
be
something
greater
than
being
merely
the
man
that
pays
the
bills
they
expect
consideration
and
thoughtfulness
that
they
are
not
giving
we
hear
too
much
of
a
wife
duties
to
a
husband
and
too
little
of
the
other
side
of
the
question
the
wife
they
tell
us
should
meet
her
husband
with
a
smile
and
a
kiss
should
tactfully
watch
his
moods
and
be
ever
sweetness
and
sunshine
why
this
continual
swinging
of
the
censer
of
devotion
to
the
man
of
business
why
should
a
woman
have
to
look
up
with
timid
glance
at
the
face
of
her
husband
to
size
up
his
mood
has
not
her
day
too
been
one
of
care
and
responsibility
and
watchfulness
has
not
been
working
over
perplexing
problems
and
worries
of
home
and
of
the
training
of
the
children
that
wifely
love
may
make
her
seek
to
solve
in
secret
is
man
then
the
weaker
sex
that
he
must
be
pampered
and
treated
as
tenderly
as
a
boil
trying
to
keep
from
contact
with
the
world
in
their
hurry
to
attain
some
ambition
to
gratify
the
dream
of
a
life
men
often
throw
honor
truth
and
generosity
to
the
winds
politicians
dare
to
stand
by
and
see
a
city
poisoned
with
foul
water
until
they
see
where
they
come
in
on
a
appropriation
if
it
be
necessary
to
poison
an
army
that
too
is
but
an
incident
in
the
hurry
for
wealth
this
is
the
age
of
the
hothouse
the
element
of
natural
growth
is
pushed
to
one
side
and
the
hothouse
and
the
are
substituted
nature
looks
on
tolerantly
as
she
says
so
far
you
may
go
but
no
farther
my
foolish
children
the
educational
system
of
is
a
monumental
institution
dedicated
to
hurry
the
children
are
forced
to
go
through
a
series
of
studies
that
sweep
the
circle
of
all
human
wisdom
they
are
given
everything
that
the
ambitious
ignorance
of
the
age
can
force
into
their
minds
they
are
taught
everything
but
the
essentials
how
to
use
their
senses
and
how
to
think
their
minds
become
congested
by
a
great
mass
of
undigested
facts
and
still
the
cruel
barbarous
forcing
goes
on
you
watch
it
until
it
seems
you
can
not
stand
it
a
moment
longer
and
you
instinctively
put
out
your
hand
and
say
stop
this
modern
slaughter
of
the
innocents
must
go
on
education
smiles
suavely
waves
her
hand
complacently
toward
her
thousands
of
over
the
country
and
says
who
are
you
that
dares
speak
a
word
against
our
sacred
school
system
education
is
in
a
hurry
because
she
fails
in
fifteen
years
to
do
what
half
the
time
should
accomplish
by
better
methods
she
should
not
be
too
boastful
incompetence
is
not
always
a
reason
for
pride
and
they
hurry
the
children
into
a
hundred
textbooks
then
into
then
into
the
colleges
then
into
a
diploma
then
into
life
with
a
dazed
mind
untrained
and
unfitted
for
the
real
duties
of
living
hurry
is
the
deathblow
to
calmness
to
dignity
to
poise
the
courtesy
went
out
when
the
hurry
came
in
hurry
is
the
father
of
dyspepsia
in
the
rush
of
our
national
life
the
bolting
of
food
has
become
a
national
vice
the
words
quick
lunches
might
properly
be
placed
on
thousands
of
headstones
in
our
cemeteries
man
forgets
that
he
is
the
only
animal
that
dines
the
others
merely
feed
why
does
he
abrogate
his
right
to
dine
and
go
to
the
end
of
the
line
with
the
mere
feeders
his
stomach
rebels
and
expresses
its
indignation
by
indigestion
then
man
has
to
go
through
life
with
a
little
bottle
of
pepsin
tablets
in
his
he
is
but
another
victim
to
this
craze
for
speed
hurry
means
the
breakdown
of
the
nerves
it
is
the
royal
road
to
nervous
prostration
everything
that
is
great
in
life
is
the
product
of
slow
growth
the
newer
and
greater
and
higher
and
nobler
the
work
the
slower
is
its
growth
the
surer
is
its
lasting
success
mushrooms
attain
their
full
power
in
a
night
oaks
require
decades
a
fad
lives
its
life
in
a
few
weeks
a
philosophy
lives
through
generations
and
centuries
if
you
are
sure
you
are
right
do
not
let
the
voice
of
the
world
or
of
friends
or
of
family
swerve
you
for
a
moment
from
your
purpose
accept
slow
growth
if
it
must
be
slow
and
know
the
results
come
as
you
would
accept
the
long
lonely
hours
of
the
night
with
absolute
assurance
that
the
moments
bring
the
morning
let
us
as
individuals
banish
the
word
hurry
from
our
lives
let
us
care
for
nothing
so
much
that
we
would
pay
honor
and
as
the
price
of
hurrying
it
let
us
cultivate
calmness
restfulness
poise
sweetness
doing
our
best
bearing
all
things
as
bravely
as
we
can
living
our
life
undisturbed
by
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
or
the
malice
of
the
envious
let
us
not
be
impatient
chafing
at
delay
fretting
over
failure
wearying
over
results
and
weakening
under
opposition
let
us
ever
turn
our
face
toward
the
future
with
confidence
and
trust
with
the
calmness
of
a
life
in
harmony
with
itself
true
to
its
ideals
and
slowly
and
constantly
progressing
toward
their
realization
let
us
see
that
cowardly
word
hurry
in
all
its
most
degenerating
phases
let
us
see
that
it
ever
kills
truth
loyalty
thoroughness
and
let
us
determine
that
day
by
day
we
will
seek
more
and
more
to
substitute
for
it
the
calmness
and
repose
of
a
true
life
nobly
lived
iii
the
power
of
personal
influence
the
only
responsibility
that
a
man
can
not
evade
in
this
life
is
the
one
he
thinks
of
least
his
personal
influence
man
conscious
influence
when
he
is
on
when
he
is
posing
to
impress
those
around
him
is
woefully
small
but
his
unconscious
influence
the
silent
subtle
radiation
of
his
personality
the
effect
of
his
words
and
acts
the
trifles
he
never
considers
is
tremendous
every
moment
of
life
he
is
changing
to
a
degree
the
life
of
the
whole
world
every
man
has
an
atmosphere
which
is
affecting
every
other
so
silent
and
unconsciously
is
this
influence
working
that
man
may
forget
that
it
exists
all
the
forces
of
nature
heat
light
electricity
and
gravitation
are
silent
and
invisible
we
never
them
we
only
know
that
they
exist
by
seeing
the
effects
they
produce
in
all
nature
the
wonders
of
the
seen
are
dwarfed
into
insignificance
when
compared
with
the
majesty
and
glory
of
the
unseen
the
great
sun
itself
does
not
supply
enough
heat
and
light
to
sustain
animal
and
vegetable
life
on
the
earth
we
are
dependent
for
nearly
half
of
our
light
and
heat
upon
the
stars
and
the
greater
part
of
this
supply
of
energy
comes
from
stars
millions
of
miles
from
the
earth
in
a
thousand
ways
nature
constantly
seeks
to
lead
men
to
a
keener
and
deeper
realization
of
the
power
and
the
wonder
of
the
invisible
into
the
hands
of
every
individual
is
given
a
marvellous
power
for
good
or
for
evil
the
silent
unconscious
unseen
influence
of
his
life
this
is
simply
the
constant
radiation
of
what
a
man
really
not
what
he
pretends
to
be
every
man
by
his
mere
living
is
radiating
sympathy
or
sorrow
or
morbidness
or
cynicism
or
happiness
or
hope
or
any
of
a
hundred
other
qualities
life
is
a
state
of
constant
radiation
and
absorption
to
exist
is
to
radiate
to
exist
is
to
be
the
recipient
of
radiations
there
are
men
and
women
whose
presence
seems
to
radiate
sunshine
cheer
and
optimism
you
feel
calmed
and
rested
and
restored
in
a
moment
to
a
new
and
stronger
faith
in
humanity
there
are
others
who
focus
in
an
instant
all
your
latent
distrust
morbidness
and
rebellion
against
life
without
knowing
why
you
chafe
and
fret
in
their
presence
you
lose
your
bearings
on
life
and
its
problems
your
moral
compass
is
disturbed
and
unsatisfactory
it
is
made
untrue
in
an
instant
as
the
magnetic
needle
of
a
ship
is
deflected
when
it
passes
near
great
mountains
of
iron
ore
there
are
men
who
float
down
the
stream
of
life
like
icebergs
cold
reserved
unapproachable
and
in
their
presence
you
involuntarily
draw
your
wraps
closer
around
you
as
you
wonder
who
left
the
door
open
these
refrigerated
human
beings
have
a
most
depressing
influence
on
all
those
who
fall
under
the
spell
of
their
radiated
chilliness
but
there
are
other
natures
warm
helpful
genial
who
are
like
the
gulf
stream
following
their
own
course
flowing
undaunted
and
undismayed
in
the
ocean
of
colder
waters
their
presence
brings
warmth
and
life
and
the
glow
of
sunshine
the
joyous
stimulating
breath
of
spring
there
are
men
who
are
like
malarious
swamps
poisonous
depressing
and
weakening
by
their
very
presence
they
make
heavy
oppressive
and
gloomy
the
atmosphere
of
their
own
homes
the
sound
of
the
children
play
is
stilled
the
ripples
of
laughter
are
frozen
by
their
presence
they
go
through
life
as
if
each
day
were
a
new
big
funeral
and
they
were
always
chief
mourners
there
are
other
men
who
seem
like
the
ocean
they
are
constantly
bracing
stimulating
giving
new
draughts
of
tonic
life
and
strength
by
their
very
presence
there
are
men
who
are
insincere
in
heart
and
that
insincerity
is
radiated
by
their
presence
they
have
a
wondrous
interest
in
your
welfare
when
they
need
you
they
put
on
a
property
smile
so
suddenly
when
it
serves
their
purpose
that
it
seems
the
smile
must
be
connected
with
some
electric
button
concealed
in
their
clothes
their
voice
has
a
simulated
cordiality
that
long
training
may
have
made
almost
natural
but
they
never
play
their
part
absolutely
true
the
mask
slip
down
sometimes
their
cleverness
can
not
teach
their
eyes
the
look
of
sterling
honesty
they
may
deceive
some
people
but
they
can
not
deceive
all
there
is
a
subtle
power
of
revelation
which
makes
us
say
well
i
can
not
explain
how
it
is
but
i
know
that
man
is
not
honest
man
can
not
escape
for
one
moment
from
this
radiation
of
his
character
this
constantly
weakening
or
strengthening
of
others
he
can
not
evade
the
responsibility
by
saying
it
is
an
unconscious
influence
he
can
the
qualities
that
he
will
permit
to
be
radiated
he
can
cultivate
sweetness
calmness
trust
generosity
truth
justice
loyalty
nobility
make
them
vitally
active
in
his
character
and
by
these
qualities
he
will
constantly
affect
the
world
discouragement
often
comes
to
honest
souls
trying
to
live
the
best
they
can
in
the
thought
that
they
are
doing
so
little
good
in
the
world
trifles
unnoted
by
us
may
be
links
in
the
chain
of
some
great
purpose
in
william
godwin
wrote
the
inquirer
a
collection
of
revolutionary
essays
on
morals
and
politics
this
book
influenced
thomas
malthus
to
write
his
essay
on
population
published
in
malthus
book
suggested
to
charles
darwin
a
point
of
view
upon
which
he
devoted
many
years
of
his
life
resulting
in
in
the
publication
of
the
origin
of
species
the
most
influential
book
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
book
that
has
revolutionized
all
science
these
were
but
three
links
of
influence
extending
over
sixty
years
it
might
be
possible
to
trace
this
genealogy
of
influence
back
from
godwin
through
generation
and
generation
to
the
word
or
act
of
some
shepherd
in
early
britain
watching
his
flock
upon
the
hills
living
his
quiet
life
and
dying
with
the
thought
that
he
had
done
nothing
to
help
the
world
men
and
women
have
duties
to
others
and
duties
to
themselves
in
justice
to
ourselves
we
should
refuse
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
that
keeps
us
from
living
our
best
if
the
fault
be
in
us
we
should
master
it
if
it
be
the
personal
influence
of
others
that
like
a
noxious
vapor
kills
our
best
impulses
we
should
remove
from
that
influence
if
we
can
move
without
forsaking
duties
if
it
be
wrong
to
move
then
we
should
take
strong
doses
of
moral
quinine
to
counteract
the
malaria
of
influence
it
is
not
what
those
around
us
for
us
that
counts
it
is
what
they
to
us
we
carry
our
from
one
window
to
another
to
give
them
the
proper
heat
light
air
and
moisture
should
we
not
be
at
least
as
careful
of
ourselves
to
make
our
influence
felt
we
must
live
our
faith
we
must
practice
what
we
believe
a
magnet
does
not
attract
iron
as
iron
it
must
first
convert
the
iron
into
another
magnet
before
it
can
attract
it
it
is
useless
for
a
parent
to
try
to
teach
gentleness
to
her
children
when
she
herself
is
cross
and
irritable
the
child
who
is
told
to
be
truthful
and
who
hears
a
parent
lie
cleverly
to
escape
some
little
social
unpleasantness
is
not
going
to
cling
very
zealously
to
truth
the
parent
words
say
do
lie
the
influence
of
the
parent
life
says
do
lie
no
man
can
ever
isolate
himself
to
evade
this
constant
power
of
influence
as
no
single
corpuscle
can
rebel
and
escape
from
the
general
course
of
the
blood
no
individual
is
so
insignificant
as
to
be
without
influence
the
changes
in
our
varying
moods
are
all
recorded
in
the
delicate
barometers
of
the
lives
of
others
we
should
ever
let
our
influence
filter
through
human
love
and
sympathy
we
should
not
be
merely
an
influence
we
should
be
an
inspiration
by
our
very
presence
we
should
be
a
tower
of
strength
to
the
hungering
human
souls
around
us
iv
the
dignity
of
without
is
as
useless
as
a
cooking
recipe
without
food
sees
the
possibilities
of
the
individual
realizes
them
sees
the
angel
in
the
unhewn
block
of
marble
carves
it
out
for
himself
the
man
who
is
says
ever
no
one
can
realize
my
possibilities
for
me
but
me
no
one
can
make
me
good
or
evil
but
myself
he
works
out
his
own
salvation
financially
socially
mentally
physically
and
morally
life
is
an
individual
problem
that
man
must
solve
for
himself
nature
accepts
no
vicarious
sacrifice
no
vicarious
service
nature
never
recognizes
a
proxy
vote
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
she
deals
only
with
the
individual
nature
is
constantly
seeking
to
show
man
that
he
is
his
own
best
friend
or
his
own
worst
enemy
nature
gives
man
the
option
on
which
he
will
be
to
himself
all
the
athletic
exercises
in
the
world
are
of
no
value
to
the
individual
unless
he
compel
those
bars
and
to
yield
to
him
in
strength
and
muscle
the
power
for
which
he
himself
pays
in
time
and
effort
he
can
never
develop
his
muscles
by
sending
his
valet
to
a
gymnasium
the
of
the
world
are
powerless
in
all
the
united
efforts
to
help
the
individual
until
he
reach
out
and
take
for
himself
what
is
needed
for
his
individual
weakness
all
the
religions
of
the
world
are
but
speculations
in
morals
mere
theories
of
salvation
until
the
individual
realize
that
he
must
save
himself
by
relying
on
the
law
of
truth
as
he
sees
it
and
living
his
life
in
harmony
with
it
as
fully
as
he
can
but
religion
is
not
a
pullman
car
with
seats
where
he
has
but
to
pay
for
his
ticket
and
some
one
else
does
all
the
rest
in
religion
as
in
all
other
great
things
he
is
ever
thrown
back
on
his
he
should
accept
all
helps
but
he
must
live
his
own
life
he
should
not
feel
that
he
is
a
mere
passenger
he
is
the
engineer
and
the
train
is
his
life
we
must
rely
on
ourselves
live
our
own
lives
or
we
merely
drift
through
existence
losing
all
that
is
best
all
that
is
greatest
all
that
is
divine
all
that
others
can
do
for
us
is
to
give
us
opportunity
we
must
ever
be
prepared
for
the
opportunity
when
it
comes
and
to
go
after
it
and
find
it
when
it
does
not
come
or
that
opportunity
is
to
us
nothing
life
is
but
a
succession
of
opportunities
they
are
for
good
or
evil
as
we
make
them
many
of
the
alchemists
of
old
felt
that
they
lacked
but
one
element
if
they
could
obtain
that
one
they
believed
they
could
transmute
the
baser
metals
into
pure
gold
it
is
so
in
character
there
are
individuals
with
rare
mental
gifts
and
delicate
spiritual
discernment
who
fail
utterly
in
life
because
they
lack
the
one
element
this
would
unite
all
their
energies
and
focus
them
into
strength
and
power
the
man
who
is
not
is
weak
hesitating
and
doubting
in
all
he
does
he
fears
to
take
a
decisive
step
because
he
dreads
failure
because
he
is
waiting
for
some
one
to
advise
him
or
because
he
dare
not
act
in
accordance
with
his
own
best
judgment
in
his
cowardice
and
his
conceit
he
sees
all
his
due
to
others
he
is
not
appreciated
not
recognized
he
is
kept
down
he
feels
that
in
some
subtle
way
society
is
conspiring
against
him
he
grows
almost
vain
as
he
thinks
that
no
one
has
had
such
poverty
such
sorrow
such
affliction
such
failure
as
have
come
to
him
the
man
who
is
seeks
ever
to
discover
and
conquer
the
weakness
within
him
that
keeps
him
from
the
attainment
of
what
he
holds
dearest
he
seeks
within
himself
the
power
to
battle
against
all
outside
influences
he
realizes
that
all
the
greatest
men
in
history
in
every
phase
of
human
effort
have
been
those
who
have
had
to
fight
against
the
odds
of
sickness
suffering
sorrow
to
him
defeat
is
no
more
than
passing
through
a
tunnel
is
to
a
traveller
he
knows
he
must
emerge
again
into
the
sunlight
the
nation
that
is
strongest
is
the
one
that
is
most
the
one
that
contains
within
its
boundaries
all
that
its
people
need
if
with
its
ports
all
blockaded
it
has
not
within
itself
the
necessities
of
life
and
the
elements
of
its
continual
progress
then
it
is
weak
held
by
the
enemy
and
it
is
but
a
question
of
time
till
it
must
surrender
its
independence
is
in
proportion
to
its
to
its
power
to
sustain
itself
from
within
what
is
true
of
nations
is
true
of
individuals
the
history
of
nations
is
but
the
biography
of
individuals
magnified
intensified
multiplied
and
projected
on
the
screen
of
the
past
history
is
the
biography
of
a
nation
biography
is
the
history
of
an
individual
so
it
must
be
that
the
individual
who
is
most
strong
in
any
trial
sorrow
or
need
is
he
who
can
live
from
his
inherent
strength
who
needs
no
scaffolding
of
commonplace
sympathy
to
uphold
him
he
must
ever
be
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
ancient
rome
relying
on
her
slaves
to
do
the
real
work
of
the
nation
proved
the
nation
downfall
the
constant
dependence
on
the
captives
of
war
to
do
the
thousand
details
of
life
for
them
killed
in
the
nation
and
in
the
individual
then
through
weakened
and
the
increased
opportunity
for
idle
luxurious
ease
that
came
with
it
rome
a
nation
of
fighters
became
a
nation
of
men
more
effeminate
than
women
as
we
depend
on
others
to
do
those
things
we
should
do
for
ourselves
our
weakens
and
our
powers
and
our
control
of
them
becomes
continuously
less
man
to
be
great
must
be
though
he
may
not
be
so
in
all
things
he
must
be
in
the
one
in
which
he
would
be
great
this
is
not
the
of
conceit
it
is
daring
to
stand
alone
be
an
oak
not
a
vine
be
ready
to
give
support
but
do
not
crave
it
do
not
be
dependent
on
it
to
develop
your
true
you
must
see
from
the
very
beginning
that
life
is
a
battle
you
must
fight
for
yourself
you
must
be
your
own
soldier
you
can
not
buy
a
substitute
you
can
not
win
a
reprieve
you
can
never
be
placed
on
the
retired
list
the
retired
list
of
life
is
death
the
world
is
busy
with
its
own
cares
sorrows
and
joys
and
pays
little
heed
to
you
there
is
but
one
great
password
to
success
if
you
would
learn
to
converse
put
yourself
into
positions
where
you
speak
if
you
would
conquer
your
morbidness
mingle
with
the
bright
people
around
you
no
matter
how
difficult
it
may
be
if
you
desire
the
power
that
some
one
else
possesses
do
not
envy
his
strength
and
dissipate
your
energy
by
weakly
wishing
his
force
were
yours
emulate
the
process
by
which
it
became
his
depend
on
your
pay
the
price
for
it
and
equal
power
may
be
yours
the
individual
must
look
upon
himself
as
an
investment
of
untold
possibilities
if
rightly
developed
a
mine
whose
resources
can
never
be
known
but
by
going
down
into
it
and
bringing
out
what
is
hidden
man
can
develop
his
by
seeking
constantly
to
surpass
himself
we
try
too
much
to
surpass
others
if
we
seek
ever
to
surpass
ourselves
we
are
moving
on
a
uniform
line
of
progress
that
gives
a
harmonious
unifying
to
our
growth
in
all
its
parts
daniel
morrell
at
one
time
president
of
the
cambria
rail
works
that
employed
men
and
made
a
rail
famed
throughout
the
world
was
asked
the
secret
of
the
great
success
of
the
works
we
have
no
secret
he
said
but
this
we
always
try
to
beat
our
last
batch
of
rails
competition
is
good
but
it
has
its
danger
side
there
is
a
tendency
to
sacrifice
real
worth
to
mere
appearance
to
have
seeming
rather
than
reality
but
the
true
competition
is
the
competition
of
the
individual
with
himself
his
present
seeking
to
excel
his
past
this
means
real
growth
from
within
develops
it
and
it
develops
let
the
individual
feel
thus
as
to
his
own
progress
and
possibilities
and
he
can
almost
create
his
life
as
he
will
let
him
never
fall
down
in
despair
at
dangers
and
sorrows
at
a
distance
they
may
be
harmless
like
bunyan
stone
lions
when
he
nears
them
the
man
who
is
does
not
live
in
the
shadow
of
some
one
else
greatness
he
thinks
for
himself
depends
on
himself
and
acts
for
himself
in
throwing
the
individual
thus
back
upon
himself
it
is
not
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
stimulus
and
light
and
new
life
that
come
with
the
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
the
kindly
word
and
the
sincere
expressions
of
true
friendship
but
true
friendship
is
rare
its
great
value
is
in
a
crisis
like
a
lifeboat
many
a
boasted
friend
has
proved
a
leaking
worthless
lifeboat
when
the
storm
of
adversity
might
make
him
useful
in
these
great
crises
of
life
man
is
strong
only
as
he
is
strong
from
within
and
the
more
he
depends
on
himself
the
stronger
will
he
become
and
the
more
able
will
he
be
to
help
others
in
the
hour
of
their
need
his
very
life
will
be
a
constant
help
and
a
strength
to
others
as
he
becomes
to
them
a
living
lesson
of
the
dignity
of
v
failure
as
a
success
it
ofttimes
requires
heroic
courage
to
face
fruitless
effort
to
take
up
the
broken
strands
of
a
to
look
bravely
toward
the
future
and
proceed
undaunted
on
our
way
but
what
to
our
eyes
may
seem
hopeless
failure
is
often
but
the
dawning
of
a
greater
success
it
may
contain
in
its
debris
the
foundation
material
of
a
mighty
purpose
or
the
revelation
of
new
and
higher
possibilities
some
years
ago
it
was
proposed
to
send
logs
from
canada
to
new
york
by
a
new
method
the
ingenious
plan
of
joggins
was
to
bind
great
logs
together
by
cables
and
iron
girders
and
to
tow
the
cargo
as
a
raft
when
the
novel
craft
neared
new
york
and
success
seemed
assured
a
terrible
storm
arose
in
the
fury
of
the
tempest
the
iron
bands
snapped
like
icicles
and
the
angry
waters
scattered
the
logs
far
and
wide
the
chief
of
the
hydrographic
department
at
washington
heard
of
the
failure
of
the
experiment
and
at
once
sent
word
to
shipmasters
the
world
over
urging
them
to
watch
carefully
for
these
logs
which
he
described
and
to
note
the
precise
location
of
each
in
latitude
and
longitude
and
the
time
the
observation
was
made
hundreds
of
captains
sailing
over
the
waters
of
the
earth
noted
the
logs
in
the
atlantic
ocean
in
the
mediterranean
in
the
south
seas
for
into
all
waters
did
these
venturesome
ones
travel
hundreds
of
reports
were
made
covering
a
period
of
weeks
and
months
these
observations
were
then
carefully
collated
systematized
and
tabulated
and
discoveries
were
made
as
to
the
course
of
ocean
currents
that
otherwise
would
have
been
impossible
the
loss
of
the
joggins
raft
was
not
a
real
failure
for
it
led
to
one
of
the
great
discoveries
in
modern
marine
geography
and
navigation
in
our
superior
knowledge
we
are
disposed
to
speak
in
a
patronizing
tone
of
the
follies
of
the
alchemists
of
old
but
their
failure
to
transmute
the
baser
metals
into
gold
resulted
in
the
birth
of
chemistry
they
did
not
succeed
in
what
they
attempted
but
they
brought
into
vogue
the
natural
processes
of
sublimation
filtration
distillation
and
crystallization
they
invented
the
alembic
the
retort
the
the
and
other
valuable
instruments
to
them
is
due
the
discovery
of
antimony
sulphuric
ether
and
phosphorus
the
cupellation
of
gold
and
silver
the
determining
of
the
properties
of
saltpetre
and
its
use
in
gunpowder
and
the
discovery
of
the
distillation
of
essential
oils
this
was
the
success
of
failure
a
wondrous
process
of
nature
for
the
highest
growth
a
mighty
lesson
of
comfort
strength
and
encouragement
if
man
would
only
realize
and
accept
it
many
of
our
failures
sweep
us
to
greater
heights
of
success
than
we
ever
hoped
for
in
our
wildest
dreams
life
is
a
successive
unfolding
of
success
from
failure
in
discovering
america
columbus
failed
absolutely
his
ingenious
reasoning
and
experiment
led
him
to
believe
that
by
sailing
westward
he
would
reach
india
every
redman
in
america
carries
in
his
name
indian
the
perpetuation
of
the
memory
of
the
failure
of
columbus
the
genoese
navigator
did
not
reach
india
the
cargo
of
souvenirs
he
took
back
to
spain
to
show
to
ferdinand
and
isabella
as
proofs
of
his
success
really
attested
his
failure
but
the
discovery
of
america
was
a
greater
success
than
was
any
finding
of
a
to
india
when
david
livingstone
had
supplemented
his
theological
education
by
a
medical
course
he
was
ready
to
enter
the
missionary
field
for
over
three
years
he
had
studied
tirelessly
with
all
energies
concentrated
on
one
aim
to
spread
the
gospel
in
china
the
hour
came
when
he
was
ready
to
start
out
with
noble
enthusiasm
for
his
chosen
work
to
consecrate
himself
and
his
life
to
his
unselfish
ambition
then
word
came
from
china
that
the
opium
war
would
make
it
folly
to
attempt
to
enter
the
country
disappointment
and
failure
did
not
long
daunt
him
he
offered
himself
as
missionary
to
africa
and
he
was
accepted
his
glorious
failure
to
reach
china
opened
a
whole
continent
to
light
and
truth
his
study
proved
an
ideal
preparation
for
his
labors
as
physician
explorer
teacher
and
evangel
in
the
wilds
of
africa
business
reverses
and
the
failure
of
his
partner
threw
upon
the
broad
shoulders
and
the
still
broader
honor
and
honesty
of
sir
walter
scott
a
burden
of
responsibility
that
forced
him
to
write
the
failure
spurred
him
to
almost
effort
the
masterpieces
of
scotch
historic
fiction
that
have
thrilled
entertained
and
uplifted
millions
of
his
are
a
glorious
monument
on
the
field
of
a
seeming
failure
when
millet
the
painter
of
the
angelus
worked
on
his
almost
divine
canvas
in
which
the
very
air
seems
pulsing
with
the
regenerating
essence
of
spiritual
reverence
he
was
painting
against
time
he
was
antidoting
sorrow
he
was
racing
against
death
his
brush
strokes
put
on
in
the
early
morning
hours
before
going
to
his
menial
duties
as
a
railway
porter
in
the
dusk
like
that
perpetuated
on
his
canvas
meant
strength
food
and
medicine
for
the
dying
wife
he
adored
the
art
failure
that
cast
him
into
the
depths
of
poverty
unified
with
marvellous
intensity
all
the
finer
elements
of
his
nature
this
rare
spiritual
unity
this
purging
of
all
the
dross
of
triviality
as
he
passed
through
the
furnace
of
poverty
trial
and
sorrow
gave
eloquence
to
his
brush
and
enabled
him
to
paint
as
never
before
as
no
prosperity
would
have
made
possible
failure
is
often
the
the
pivot
of
circumstance
that
swings
us
to
higher
levels
it
may
not
be
financial
success
it
may
not
be
fame
it
may
be
new
draughts
of
spiritual
moral
or
mental
inspiration
that
will
change
us
for
all
the
later
years
of
our
life
life
is
not
really
what
comes
to
us
but
what
we
get
from
it
whether
man
has
had
wealth
or
poverty
failure
or
success
counts
for
little
when
it
is
past
there
is
but
one
question
for
him
to
answer
to
face
boldly
and
honestly
as
an
individual
alone
with
his
conscience
and
his
destiny
how
will
i
let
that
poverty
or
wealth
affect
me
if
that
trial
or
deprivation
has
left
me
better
truer
nobler
then
poverty
has
been
riches
failure
has
been
a
success
if
wealth
has
come
to
me
and
has
made
me
vain
arrogant
contemptuous
uncharitable
cynical
closing
from
me
all
the
tenderness
of
life
all
the
channels
of
higher
development
of
possible
good
to
my
making
me
the
mere
custodian
of
a
then
wealth
has
lied
to
me
it
has
been
failure
not
success
it
has
not
been
riches
it
has
been
dark
treacherous
poverty
that
stole
from
me
even
myself
all
things
become
for
us
then
what
we
take
from
them
failure
is
one
of
god
educators
it
is
experience
leading
man
to
higher
things
it
is
the
revelation
of
a
way
a
path
hitherto
unknown
to
us
the
best
men
in
the
world
those
who
have
made
the
greatest
real
successes
look
back
with
serene
happiness
on
their
failures
the
turning
of
the
face
of
time
shows
all
things
in
a
wondrously
illuminated
and
satisfying
perspective
many
a
man
is
thankful
that
some
petty
success
for
which
he
once
struggled
melted
into
thin
air
as
his
hand
sought
to
clutch
it
failure
is
often
the
foundation
of
real
success
if
man
in
a
few
instances
of
his
life
can
say
those
failures
were
the
best
things
in
the
world
that
could
have
happened
to
me
should
he
not
face
new
failures
with
undaunted
courage
and
trust
that
the
miraculous
ministry
of
nature
may
transform
these
new
into
new
our
highest
hopes
are
often
destroyed
to
prepare
us
for
better
things
the
failure
of
the
caterpillar
is
the
birth
of
the
butterfly
the
passing
of
the
bud
is
the
becoming
of
the
rose
the
death
or
destruction
of
the
seed
is
the
prelude
to
its
resurrection
as
wheat
it
is
at
night
in
the
darkest
hours
those
preceding
dawn
that
plants
grow
best
that
they
most
increase
in
size
may
this
not
be
one
of
nature
gentle
showings
to
man
of
the
times
when
he
grows
best
of
the
darkness
of
failure
that
is
evolving
into
the
sunlight
of
success
let
us
fear
only
the
failure
of
not
living
the
right
as
we
see
it
leaving
the
results
to
the
guardianship
of
the
infinite
if
we
think
of
any
supreme
moment
of
our
lives
any
great
success
any
one
who
is
dear
to
us
and
then
consider
how
we
reached
that
moment
that
success
that
friend
we
will
be
surprised
and
strengthened
by
the
revelation
as
we
trace
each
one
back
step
by
step
through
the
genealogy
of
circumstances
we
will
see
how
logical
has
been
the
course
of
our
joy
and
success
from
sorrow
and
failure
and
that
what
gives
us
most
happiness
is
inextricably
connected
with
what
once
caused
us
sorrow
many
of
the
rivers
of
our
greatest
prosperity
and
growth
have
had
their
source
and
their
trickling
increase
into
volume
among
the
dark
gloomy
recesses
of
our
failure
there
is
no
honest
and
true
work
carried
along
with
constant
and
sincere
purpose
that
ever
really
fails
if
it
sometime
seem
to
be
wasted
effort
it
will
prove
to
us
a
new
lesson
of
how
to
walk
the
secret
of
our
failures
will
prove
to
us
the
inspiration
of
possible
successes
man
living
with
the
highest
aims
ever
as
best
he
can
in
continuous
harmony
with
them
is
a
success
no
matter
what
statistics
of
failure
a
and
world
of
critics
and
commentators
may
lay
at
his
door
high
ideals
noble
efforts
will
make
seeming
failures
but
trifles
they
need
not
dishearten
us
they
should
prove
sources
of
new
strength
the
rocky
way
may
prove
safer
than
the
slippery
path
of
smoothness
birds
can
not
fly
best
with
the
wind
but
against
it
ships
do
not
progress
in
calm
when
the
sails
flap
idly
against
the
unstrained
masts
the
alchemy
of
nature
superior
to
that
of
the
paracelsians
constantly
transmutes
the
baser
metals
of
failure
into
the
later
pure
gold
of
higher
success
if
the
mind
of
the
worker
be
kept
true
constant
and
untiring
in
the
service
and
he
have
that
sublime
courage
that
defies
fate
to
its
worst
while
he
does
his
best
vi
doing
our
best
at
all
times
life
is
a
wondrously
complex
problem
for
the
individual
until
some
day
in
a
moment
of
illumination
he
awakens
to
the
great
realization
that
he
can
make
it
simple
never
quite
simple
but
always
simpler
there
are
a
thousand
mysteries
of
right
and
wrong
that
have
baffled
the
wise
men
of
the
ages
there
are
depths
in
the
great
fundamental
questions
of
the
human
race
that
no
plummet
of
philosophy
has
ever
sounded
there
are
wild
cries
of
honest
hunger
for
truth
that
seek
to
pierce
the
silence
beyond
the
grave
but
to
them
ever
echo
back
only
a
repetition
of
their
unanswered
cries
to
us
all
comes
at
times
the
great
note
of
questioning
despair
that
darkens
our
horizon
and
paralyzes
our
effort
if
there
really
be
a
god
if
eternal
justice
really
rule
the
world
we
say
why
should
life
be
as
it
is
why
do
some
men
starve
while
others
feast
why
does
virtue
often
languish
in
the
shadow
while
vice
triumphs
in
the
sunshine
why
does
failure
so
often
dog
the
footsteps
of
honest
effort
while
the
success
that
comes
from
trickery
and
dishonor
is
greeted
with
the
world
applause
how
is
it
that
the
loving
father
of
one
family
is
taken
by
death
while
the
worthless
incumbrance
of
another
is
spared
why
is
there
so
much
unnecessary
pain
sorrowing
and
suffering
in
the
world
why
indeed
should
there
be
any
neither
philosophy
nor
religion
can
give
any
final
satisfactory
answer
that
is
capable
of
logical
demonstration
of
absolute
proof
there
is
ever
even
after
the
best
explanations
a
residuum
of
the
unexplained
we
must
then
fall
back
in
the
eternal
arms
of
faith
and
be
wise
enough
to
say
i
will
not
be
disconcerted
by
these
problems
of
life
i
will
not
permit
them
to
plunge
me
into
doubt
and
to
cloud
my
life
with
vagueness
and
uncertainty
man
arrogates
much
to
himself
when
he
demands
from
the
infinite
the
full
solution
of
all
his
mysteries
i
will
found
my
life
on
the
impregnable
rock
of
a
simple
fundamental
truth
glorious
creation
with
its
millions
of
wondrous
phenomena
pulsing
ever
in
harmony
with
eternal
law
must
have
a
creator
that
creator
must
be
omniscient
and
omnipotent
but
that
creator
himself
can
not
in
justice
demand
of
any
creature
more
than
the
best
that
that
individual
can
give
i
will
do
each
day
in
every
moment
the
best
i
can
by
the
light
i
have
i
will
ever
seek
more
light
more
perfect
illumination
of
truth
and
ever
live
as
best
i
can
in
harmony
with
the
truth
as
i
see
it
if
failure
come
i
will
meet
it
bravely
if
my
pathway
then
lie
in
the
shadow
of
trial
sorrow
and
suffering
i
shall
have
the
restful
peace
and
the
calm
strength
of
one
who
has
done
his
best
who
can
look
back
upon
the
past
with
no
pang
of
regret
and
who
has
heroic
courage
in
facing
the
results
whatever
they
be
knowing
that
he
could
not
make
them
different
upon
this
this
foundation
man
may
erect
any
superstructure
of
religion
or
philosophy
that
he
conscientiously
can
erect
he
should
add
to
his
equipment
for
living
every
shred
of
strength
and
inspiration
moral
mental
or
spiritual
that
is
in
his
power
to
secure
this
simple
working
faith
is
opposed
to
no
creed
is
a
substitute
for
none
it
is
but
a
primary
belief
a
citadel
a
refuge
where
the
individual
can
retire
for
strength
when
the
battle
of
life
grows
hard
a
mere
theory
of
life
that
remains
but
a
theory
is
about
as
useful
to
a
man
as
a
menu
is
to
a
starving
sailor
on
a
raft
in
it
is
irritating
but
not
stimulating
no
rule
for
higher
living
will
help
a
man
in
the
slightest
until
he
reach
out
and
appropriate
it
for
himself
until
he
make
it
practical
in
his
daily
life
until
that
seed
of
theory
in
his
mind
blossom
into
a
thousand
flowers
of
thought
and
word
and
act
if
a
man
honestly
seeks
to
live
his
best
at
all
times
that
determination
is
visible
in
every
moment
of
his
living
no
trifle
in
his
life
can
be
too
insignificant
to
reflect
his
principle
of
living
the
sun
illuminates
and
beautifies
a
fallen
leaf
by
the
roadside
as
impartially
as
a
towering
mountain
peak
in
the
alps
every
drop
of
water
in
the
ocean
is
an
epitome
of
the
chemistry
of
the
whole
ocean
every
drop
is
subject
to
precisely
the
same
laws
as
dominate
the
united
infinity
of
billions
of
drops
that
make
that
miracle
of
nature
men
call
the
sea
no
matter
how
humble
the
calling
of
the
individual
how
uninteresting
and
dull
the
round
of
his
duties
he
should
do
his
best
he
should
dignify
what
he
is
doing
by
the
mind
he
puts
into
it
he
should
vitalize
what
little
he
has
of
power
or
energy
or
ability

when
they

this
will
never
lead
man
to
that
weak
content
that
is
satisfied
with
whatever
falls

it
will
rather
fill
his
mind
with
that

discontent
that
cheerfully
accepts

as

the
man
who
is

ever
to
do
his
best
is
the
man
who
is
keen
active
and
aggressive
he
is
ever
watchful
of
himself
in
trifles
his

not

is
it
worthy

edwin
booth
one
of
the
greatest
actors
on
the
american
stage
would
never
permit
himself
to
assume
an
ungraceful
attitude
even
in
his
hours
of
privacy
in
this
simple
thing
he
ever
lived
his
best
on
the
stage
every
move
was
one
of
unconscious
grace
those
of
his
company
who
were
conscious
of
their
motions
were
the
awkward
ones
who
were
seeking
in
public
to
undo
or
to
conceal
the
carelessness
of
the
gestures
and
motions
of
their
private
life
the
man
who
is
slipshod
and
thoughtless
in
his
daily
speech
whose
vocabulary
is
a
collection
of
anaemic
commonplaces
whose
repetitions
of
phrases
and
extravagance
of
interjections
act
but
as
feeble
disguises
to
his
lack
of
ideas
will
never
be
brilliant
on
an
occasion
when
he
longs
to
outshine
the
stars
living
at
one
best
is
constant
preparation
for

use
it
can
never
make
one
affected
or
priggish
education
in
its
highest
sense
is
training
of
mind
or
body
to
act
it
is
conscious
formation
of
mental
habits
not
mere
acquisition
of
information
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
the
individual
unwisely
eclipses
himself
is
in
his
worship
of
the
fetich
of
luck
he
feels
that
all
others
are
lucky
and
that
whatever
he
attempts
fails
he
does
not
realize
the
untiring
energy
the
unremitting
concentration
the
heroic
courage
the
sublime
patience
that
is
the
secret
of
some
men
success
their
luck
was
that
they
had
prepared
themselves
to
be
equal
to
their
opportunity
when
it
came
and
were
awake
to
recognize
it
and
receive
it
his
own
opportunity
came
and
departed
unnoted
it
would
not
waken
him
from
his
dreams
of
some
untold
wealth
that
would
fall
into
his
lap
so
he
grows
discouraged
and
envies
those
whom
he
should
emulate
and
he
bandages
his
arm
and
chloroforms
his
energies
and
performs
his
duties
in
a
perfunctory
way
or
he
passes
through
life
just
ever
sampling
lines
of
activity
the
honest
faithful
struggler
should
always
realize
that
failure
is
but
an
episode
in
a
true
man
life
never
the
whole
story
it
is
never
easy
to
meet
and
no
philosophy
can
make
it
so
but
the
steadfast
courage
to
master
conditions
instead
of
complaining
of
them
will
help
him
on
his
way
it
will
ever
enable
him
to
get
the
best
out
of
what
he
has
he
never
knows
the
long
series
of
vanquished
failures
that
give
solidity
to
some
one
else
success
he
does
not
realize
the
price
that
some
rich
man
the
innocent
football
of
political
malcontents
and
demagogues
has
heroicly
paid
for
wealth
and
position
the
man
who
has
a
pessimist
doubt
of
all
things
who
demands
a
certified
guarantee
of
his
future
who
ever
fears
his
work
will
not
be
recognized
or
appreciated
or
that
after
all
it
is
really
not
worth
while
will
never
live
his
best
he
is
dulling
his
capacity
for
real
progress
by
his
hypnotic
course
of
excuses
for
inactivity
instead
of
a
strong
tonic
of
reasons
for
action
one
of
the
most
weakening
elements
in
the
individual
is
the
surrender
to
the
oncoming
of
years
man
dims
and
dies
in
the
fear
of
age
this
new
thought
he
says
of
some
suggestion
tending
to
higher
development
is
good
it
is
what
we
need
i
am
glad
to
have
it
for
my
children
i
would
have
been
happy
to
have
had
some
such
help
when
i
was
at
school
but
it
is
too
late
for
me
i
am
a
man
advanced
in
years
this
is
but
blind
closing
of
life
to
wondrous
possibilities
the
knell
of
lost
opportunity
is
never
tolled
in
this
life
it
is
never
too
late
to
recognize
truth
and
to
live
by
it
it
requires
only
greater
effort
closer
attention
deeper
consecration
but
the
impossible
does
not
exist
for
the
man
who
is
and
is
willing
to
pay
the
price
in
time
and
struggle
for
his
success
or
development
later
in
life
the
assessments
are
heavier
in
progress
as
in

insurance
but
that
matters
not

that
mighty
that
not

a

nobler
and

the

and
the

you

the

has
gone
back
with
all
its

all

all
its

to
the
god
who
loaned
you
the
golden
moments
to
use
in
obedience
to
his
law
vii
the
royal
road
to
happiness
during
my
whole
life
i
have
not
had
hours
of
happiness
so
said
prince
bismarck
one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
of
the
nineteenth
century
years
of
wealth
fame
honors
power
influence
prosperity
and
triumph
years
when
he
held
an
empire
in
his
fingers
but
not
one
day
of
happiness
happiness
is
the
greatest
paradox
in
nature
it
can
grow
in
any
soil
live
under
any
conditions
it
defies
environment
it
comes
from
within
it
is
the
revelation
of
the
depths
of
the
inner
life
as
light
and
heat
proclaim
the
sun
from
which
they
radiate
happiness
consists
not
of
having
but
of
being
not
of
possessing
but
of
enjoying
it
is
the
warm
glow
of
a
heart
at
peace
with
itself
a
martyr
at
the
stake
may
have
happiness
that
a
king
on
his
throne
might
envy
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
it
is
the
aroma
of
a
life
lived
in
harmony
with
high
ideals
for
what
a
man
he
may
be
dependent
on
others
what
he
rests
with
him
alone
what
he
in
life
is
but
acquisition
what
he
is
growth
happiness
is
the
soul
joy
in
the
possession
of
the
intangible
absolute
perfect
continuous
happiness
in
life
is
impossible
for
the
human
it
would
mean
the
consummation
of
attainments
the
individual
consciousness
of
a
perfectly
fulfilled
destiny
happiness
is
paradoxic
because
it
may
coexist
with
trial
sorrow
and
poverty
it
is
the
gladness
of
the
heart
rising
superior
to
all
conditions
happiness
has
a
number
of
gratification
satisfaction
content
and
pleasure
clever
imitators
that
simulate
its
appearance
rather
than
emulate
its
method
gratification
is
a
harmony
between
our
desires
and
our
possessions
it
is
ever
incomplete
it
is
the
thankful
acceptance
of
part
it
is
a
mental
pleasure
in
the
quality
of
what
one
receives
an
unsatisfiedness
as
to
the
quantity
it
may
be
an
element
in
happiness
but
in
itself
it
is
not
happiness
satisfaction
is
perfect
identity
of
our
desires
and
our
possessions
it
exists
only
so
long
as
this
perfect
union
and
unity
can
be
preserved
but
every
realized
ideal
gives
birth
to
new
ideals
every
step
in
advance
reveals
large
domains
of
the
unattained
every
feeding
stimulates
new
appetites
then
the
desires
and
possessions
are
no
longer
identical
no
longer
equal
new
cravings
call
forth
new
activities
the
equipoise
is
destroyed
and
dissatisfaction
reenters
man
might
possess
everything
tangible
in
the
world
and
yet
not
be
happy
for
happiness
is
the
satisfying
of
the
soul
not
of
the
mind
or
the
body
dissatisfaction
in
its
highest
sense
is
the
keynote
of
all
advance
the
evidence
of
new
aspirations
the
guarantee
of
the
progressive
revelation
of
new
possibilities
content
is
a
greatly
overrated
virtue
it
is
a
kind
of
diluted
despair
it
is
the
feeling
with
which
we
continue
to
accept
substitutes
without
striving
for
the
realities
content
makes
the
trained
individual
swallow
vinegar
and
try
to
smack
his
lips
as
if
it
were
wine
content
enables
one
to
warm
his
hands
at
the
fire
of
a
past
joy
that
exists
only
in
memory
content
is
a
mental
and
moral
chloroform
that
deadens
the
activities
of
the
individual
to
rise
to
higher
planes
of
life
and
growth
man
should
never
be
contented
with
anything
less
than
the
best
efforts
of
his
nature
can
possibly
secure
for
him
content
makes
the
world
more
comfortable
for
the
individual
but
it
is
the
of
progress
man
should
be
content
with
each
step
of
progress
merely
as
a
station
discontented
with
it
as
a
destination
contented
with
it
as
a
step
discontented
with
it
as
a
finality
there
are
times
when
a
man
should
be
content
with
what
he
but
never
with
what
he
but
content
is
not
happiness
neither
is
pleasure
pleasure
is
temporary
happiness
is
continuous
pleasure
is
a
note
happiness
is
a
symphony
pleasure
may
exist
when
conscience
utters
protests
happiness
never
pleasure
may
have
its
dregs
and
its
lees
but
none
can
be
found
in
the
cup
of
happiness
man
is
the
only
animal
that
can
be
really
happy
to
the
rest
of
the
creation
belong
only
weak
imitations
of
the
understudies
happiness
represents
a
peaceful
attunement
of
a
life
with
a
standard
of
living
it
can
never
be
made
by
the
individual
by
himself
for
himself
it
is
one
of
the
incidental
of
an
unselfish
life
no
man
can
make
his
own
happiness
the
one
object
of
his
life
and
attain
it
any
more
than
he
can
jump
on
the
far
end
of
his
shadow
if
you
would
hit
the
of
happiness
on
the
target
of
life
aim
above
it
place
other
things
higher
than
your
own
happiness
and
it
will
surely
come
to
you
you
can
buy
pleasure
you
can
acquire
content
you
can
become
satisfied
but
nature
never
put
real
happiness
on
the
it
is
the
undetachable
accompaniment
of
true
living
it
is
calm
and
peaceful
it
never
lives
in
an
atmosphere
of
worry
or
of
hopeless
struggle
the
basis
of
happiness
is
the
love
of
something
outside
self
search
every
instance
of
happiness
in
the
world
and
you
will
find
when
all
the
incidental
features
are
eliminated
there
is
always
the
constant
unchangeable
element
of
love
love
of
parent
for
child
love
of
man
and
woman
for
each
other
love
of
humanity
in
some
form
or
a
great
life
work
into
which
the
individual
throws
all
his
energies
happiness
is
the
voice
of
optimism
of
faith
of
simple
steadfast
love
no
cynic
or
pessimist
can
be
really
happy
a
cynic
is
a
man
who
is
morally
and
brags
about
it
he
sees
the
evil
in
his
own
heart
and
thinks
he
sees
the
world
he
lets
a
mote
in
his
eye
eclipse
the
sun
an
incurable
cynic
is
an
individual
who
should
long
for
death
for
life
can
not
bring
him
happiness
death
might
the
keynote
of
bismarck
lack
of
happiness
was
his
profound
distrust
of
human
nature
there
is
a
royal
road
to
happiness
it
lies
in
consecration
concentration
conquest
and
conscience
consecration
is
dedicating
the
individual
life
to
the
service
of
others
to
some
noble
mission
to
realizing
some
unselfish
ideal
life
is
not
something
to
be
lived
it
is
something
to
be
lived
it
is
a
privilege
not
a
penal
servitude
of
so
many
decades
on
earth
consecration
places
the
object
of
life
above
the
mere
acquisition
of
money
as
a
finality
the
man
who
is
unselfish
kind
loving
tender
helpful
ready
to
lighten
the
burden
of
those
around
him
to
hearten
the
struggling
ones
to
forget
himself
sometimes
in
remembering
others
is
on
the
right
road
to
happiness
consecration
is
ever
active
bold
and
aggressive
fearing
naught
but
possible
disloyalty
to
high
ideals
concentration
makes
the
individual
life
simpler
and
deeper
it
cuts
away
the
shams
and
pretences
of
modern
living
and
limits
life
to
its
truest
essentials
worry
fear
useless
regret
all
the
great
wastes
that
sap
mental
moral
or
physical
energy
must
be
sacrificed
or
the
individual
needlessly
destroys
half
the
possibilities
of
living
a
great
purpose
in
life
something
that
unifies
the
strands
and
threads
of
each
day
thinking
something
that
takes
the
sting
from
the
petty
trials
sorrows
sufferings
and
blunders
of
life
is
a
great
aid
to
concentration
soldiers
in
battle
may
forget
their
wounds
or
even
be
unconscious
of
them
in
the
inspiration
of
battling
for
what
they
believe
is
right
concentration
dignifies
an
humble
life
it
makes
a
great
life
sublime
in
morals
it
is
a
to
simplicity
it
leads
to
right
for
right
sake
without
thought
of
policy
or
of
reward
it
brings
calm
and
rest
to
the
individual
a
serenity
that
is
but
the
sunlight
of
happiness
conquest
is
the
overcoming
of
an
evil
habit
the
rising
superior
to
opposition
and
attack
the
spiritual
exaltation
that
comes
from
resisting
the
invasion
of
the
grovelling
material
side
of
life
sometimes
when
you
are
worn
and
weak
with
the
struggle
when
it
seems
that
justice
is
a
dream
that
honesty
and
loyalty
and
truth
count
for
nothing
that
the
devil
is
the
only
good
paymaster
when
hope
grows
dim
and
flickers
then
is
the
time
when
you
must
tower
in
the
great
sublime
faith
that
right
must
prevail
then
must
you
throttle
these
imps
of
doubt
and
despair
you
must
master
yourself
to
master
the
world
around
you
this
is
conquest
this
is
what
counts
even
a
log
can
float
with
the
current
it
takes
a
man
to
fight
sturdily
against
an
opposing
tide
that
would
sweep
his
craft
out
of
its
course
when
the
jealousies
the
petty
intrigues
and
the
meannesses
and
the
misunderstandings
in
life
assail
you
rise
above
them
be
like
a
lighthouse
that
illumines
and
beautifies
the
snarling
swashing
waves
of
the
storm
that
threaten
it
that
seek
to
undermine
it
and
seek
to
wash
over
it
this
is
conquest
when
the
chance
to
win
fame
wealth
success
or
the
attainment
of
your
heart
desire
by
sacrifice
of
honor
or
principle
comes
to
you
and
it
does
not
affect
you
long
enough
even
to
seem
a
temptation
you
have
been
the
victor
that
too
is
conquest
and
conquest
is
part
of
the
royal
road
to
happiness
conscience
as
the
mentor
the
guide
and
compass
of
every
act
leads
ever
to
happiness
when
the
individual
can
stay
alone
with
his
conscience
and
get
its
approval
without
using
force
or
specious
logic
then
he
begins
to
know
what
real
happiness
is
but
the
individual
must
be
careful
that
he
is
not
appealing
to
a
conscience
perverted
or
deadened
by
the
wrongdoing
and
subsequent
deafness
of
its
owner
the
man
who
is
honestly
seeking
to
live
his
life
in
consecration
concentration
and
conquest
living
from
day
to
day
as
best
he
can
by
the
light
he
has
may
rely
explicitly
on
his
conscience
he
can
shut
his
ears
to
what
the
world
says
and
find
in
the
approval
of
his
own
conscience
the
highest
earthly
tribune
the
voice
of
the
infinite
communing
with
the
individual
unhappiness
is
the
hunger
to
get
happiness
is
the
hunger
to
give
true
happiness
must
ever
have
the
tinge
of
sorrow
outlived
the
sense
of
pain
softened
by
the
mellowing
years
the
chastening
of
loss
that
in
the
wondrous
mystery
of
time
transmutes
our
suffering
into
love
and
sympathy
with
others
if
the
individual
should
set
out
for
a
single
day
to
give
happiness
to
make
life
happier
brighter
and
sweeter
not
for
himself
but
for
others
he
would
find
a
wondrous
revelation
of
what
happiness
really
is
the
greatest
of
the
world
heroes
could
not
by
any
series
of
acts
of
heroism
do
as
much
real
good
as
any
individual
living
his
whole
life
in
seeking
from
day
to
day
to
make
others
happy
each
day
there
should
be
fresh
resolution
new
strength
and
renewed
enthusiasm
just
for
today
might
be
the
daily
motto
of
thousands
of
societies
throughout
the
country
composed
of
members
bound
together
to
make
the
world
better
through
constant
simple
acts
of
kindness
constant
deeds
of
sweetness
and
love
and
happiness
would
come
to
them
in
its
highest
and
best
form
not
because
they
would
seek
to
it
but
because
they
seek
to
it
