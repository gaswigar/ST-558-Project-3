dedication
to
the
seventies
that
body
of
men
upon
whom
under
the
direction
of
the
twelve
apostles
devolves
the
responsibility
of
preaching
the
gospel
and
defending
the
truth
in
all
the
world
this
work
is
affectionately
dedicated
a
word
with
students
and
teachers
before
you
take
up
the
study
of
outlines
of
ecclesiastical
history
i
beg
leave
to
call
your
attention
to
the
structure
of
the
work
and
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
written
first
then
as
to
its
structure
the
work
is
divided
into
four
parts
each
with
a
distinct
idea
running
through
it
part
i
deals
with
the
establishment
of
the
church
through
the
ministry
of
messiah
and
his
apostles
part
ii
with
the
apostasy
brought
about
through
the
severe
persecution
to
which
the
early
saints
were
subjected
the
rise
of
false
teachers
changing
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
intermingling
pagan
philosophy
with
christian
doctrine
and
a
transgression
of
the
laws
of
god
part
iii
deals
with
the
reformation
treating
it
however
as
a
revolution
instead
of
a
reformation
since
the
reformation
by
no
means
primitive
christianity
either
in
its
form
or
essence
but
it
did
overthrow
the
power
of
the
catholic
church
in
the
greater
part
of
western
europe
gave
larger
liberty
to
the
people
and
thus
prepared
the
way
for
the
great
work
which
followed
it
the
introduction
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
part
iv
treats
of
the
restoration
of
the
gospel
in
the
aforesaid
dispensation
through
the
revelations
which
god
gave
to
the
prophet
joseph
smith
the
parts
above
enumerated
are
separated
into
sections
these
subdivisions
being
determined
by
the
several
subjects
into
which
the
main
idea
of
the
respective
parts
naturally
divides
the
sections
are
again
separated
into
topics
the
iv
titles
of
which
are
printed
in
type
and
the
paragraphs
are
numbered
these
divisions
it
is
believed
will
better
enable
the
student
to
discern
the
relation
of
the
respective
parts
to
the
main
subject
and
at
the
same
time
afford
a
convenient
division
for
the
assignment
of
lessons
to
classes
ordinarily
it
will
be
found
that
a
section
will
be
sufficient
for
a
lesson
for
either
a
class
or
quorum
but
in
some
instances
two
of
the
shorter
sections
may
be
taken
for
a
lesson
but
some
of
the
longer
sections
should
be
divided
into
two
or
more
at
the
end
of
each
section
will
be
found
a
collection
of
notes
bearing
upon
the
important
points
treated
in
the
text
of
the
work
at
which
place
reference
will
be
found
to
the
note
at
the
end
of
the
section
the
author
can
not
in
his
opinion
too
emphatically
urge
upon
the
student
the
importance
of
turning
to
the
notes
to
which
he
is
directed
in
the
text
and
reading
them
they
will
be
found
to
throw
additional
light
upon
the
subject
treated
in
the
text
either
by
giving
the
statement
of
a
recognized
authority
supplying
pointed
argument
with
which
it
has
been
thought
best
not
to
burden
the
body
of
the
work
or
giving
illustrations
to
the
statement
made
in
the
text
another
purpose
for
placing
these
notes
at
the
end
of
the
sections
has
been
to
arouse
an
interest
in
the
works
of
the
authors
quoted
that
the
students
of
this
text
book
may
be
induced
to
delve
deeper
into
the
study
of
ecclesiastical
history
than
a
perusal
of
these
pages
will
enable
them
to
do
and
here
let
the
author
confess
while
he
believes
he
is
presenting
a
very
valuable
collection
of
facts
to
those
who
will
take
up
the
study
of
his
work
yet
if
the
study
of
these
pages
shall
result
in
merely
awakening
in
the
minds
of
the
elders
and
the
youth
of
israel
an
interest
in
the
subject
he
will
account
the
objects
of
his
efforts
successfully
attained
at
the
end
of
each
section
also
will
be
found
review
questions
covering
the
main
points
treated
in
the
text
and
in
the
notes
it
is
hoped
that
they
will
be
found
useful
in
conducting
v
class
exercises
and
to
the
private
student
who
wishes
to
ascertain
if
he
has
mastered
the
subject
matter
of
each
section
let
him
put
to
himself
the
questions
found
in
the
review
at
the
end
of
the
section
when
completing
it
and
if
he
can
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
each
one
the
author
feels
assured
that
the
student
has
mastered
the
salient
points
the
purpose
of
the
work
is
first
it
is
to
sustain
the
position
taken
by
the
church
of
christ
in
the
last
days
what
that
position
is
may
be
readily
discerned
by
the
very
first
revelation
the
lord
gave
to
joseph
smith
in
answering
the
young
question
which
of
all
the
sects
of
religion
was
acknowledged
of
him
as
his
church
and
kingdom
the
lord
said
they
were
all
wrong
that
all
their
creeds
were
an
abomination
in
his
sight
that
those
professors
were
all
corrupt
that
they
drew
near
to
him
with
their
lips
but
their
hearts
were
far
from
him
that
they
taught
for
doctrine
the
commandments
of
men
having
a
form
of
godliness
but
denying
the
power
thereof
it
has
been
to
bring
together
the
historical
evidences
of
the
truth
of
this
divine
announcement
that
in
part
this
work
has
been
written
and
therefore
prominence
has
been
given
to
those
facts
of
history
which
support
that
announcement
but
no
fact
has
been
suppressed
that
has
a
tendency
to
support
the
opposite
view
no
such
fact
either
of
history
or
prophecy
exists
the
whole
stream
of
evidence
proves
that
there
has
been
a
universal
apostasy
from
the
religion
taught
by
jesus
christ
and
his
apostles
and
the
existing
differences
between
the
present
teachings
of
christendom
and
the
doctrines
of
the
scriptures
is
a
proof
so
palpable
that
it
admits
of
no
contradiction
as
this
position
of
the
church
is
one
which
the
seventies
and
elders
will
have
to
maintain
against
all
the
world
it
is
of
first
importance
that
they
become
familiar
with
those
facts
of
history
and
of
prophecy
that
will
enable
them
to
maintain
that
position
intelligently
and
successfully
the
second
purpose
of
the
work
is
to
teach
the
principles
of
the
gospel
this
the
author
is
convinced
can
best
be
done
in
connection
with
their
history
relate
the
historical
events
which
resulted
in
the
introduction
and
establishment
of
the
gospel
and
the
church
of
christ
then
in
all
the
centuries
from
the
second
to
the
tenth
show
how
the
doctrines
of
messiah
were
departed
from
how
the
ordinances
were
changed
and
the
laws
of
god
transgressed
relate
the
principal
events
of
the
sixteenth
century
revolution
miscalled
the
reformation
and
point
out
how
that
revolution
however
salutary
in
bringing
to
pass
an
enlargement
of
popular
liberty
failed
to
the
gospel
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
or
the
church
as
at
first
founded
by
messiah
then
relate
the
events
connected
with
the
restoration
of
the
gospel
through
the
revelations
given
to
the
great
prophet
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
joseph
smith
and
in
so
doing
you
are
not
only
teaching
the
interesting
facts
of
ecclesiastical
history
to
your
students
but
at
the
same
time
you
are
making
them
acquainted
with
the
principles
of
the
gospel
under
such
a
presentation
the
students
without
being
conscious
of
it
perhaps
will
examine
those
principles
under
a
variety
of
circumstances
they
will
see
them
stated
in
connection
with
the
leading
events
of
the
messiah
life
they
will
see
them
corrupted
by
an
apostate
church
they
will
hear
them
discussed
by
men
during
the
attempt
at
reformation
and
after
witnessing
the
unavailing
efforts
of
the
reformers
to
the
gospel
and
the
church
of
christ
they
will
see
how
the
heavens
were
opened
and
every
principle
doctrine
ordinance
law
officer
and
institution
known
to
the
church
of
christ
restored
such
a
presentation
of
the
principles
of
the
gospel
we
repeat
must
lead
to
a
very
comprehensive
understanding
of
them
and
such
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
work
and
one
which
the
author
hopes
will
give
it
a
claim
upon
the
attention
of
all
those
desiring
information
on
the
subject
of
the
gospel
as
well
as
to
the
quorums
of
seventies
and
elders
to
whom
we
believe
it
will
be
of
special
service
before
the
work
went
to
press
the
manuscript
was
submitted
to
a
committee
of
brethren
appointed
by
the
first
presidency
elders
john
nicholson
george
reynolds
and
james
talmage
constituted
that
committee
the
author
is
very
much
indebted
to
them
for
their
patient
consideration
of
his
manuscript
and
for
the
very
valuable
suggestions
and
corrections
made
by
them
they
reported
favorably
to
the
first
presidency
on
the
work
and
it
is
now
presented
to
the
students
of
ecclesiastical
history
in
which
the
church
of
christ
should
abound
in
the
hope
that
it
will
be
of
service
to
them
in
their
researches
in
this
most
interesting
department
of
knowledge
this
the
fifth

is

the
place
of
his
birth
was
bethlehem
a
small
town
about
four
miles
south
of
jerusalem
the
of
messiah
was
foretold
by
micah
the
prophet
more
than
seven
hundred
years
before
the
event
in
the
following
prophecy
but
thou
bethlehem
ephratah
though
thou
be
little
among
the
thousands
of
judah
yet
out
of
thee
shall
he
come
forth
unto
me

is
to
be
ruler
in
israel
whose
goings

been
from
of
old
from
everlasting
parentage
of
messiah
was
born
of
the
virgin
mary
a
descendant
of
david
and
the
espoused
wife
of
joseph
a
carpenter
in
the
little
village
of
nazareth
who
notwithstanding
his
humble
station
in
life
was
also
a
descendant
of
the
royal
house
of
david
an
angel
appeared
unto
mary
previous
to
her
conception
and
thus
addressed
her
hail
thou
that
art
highly
favored
the
lord
is
with
thee
blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
when
she
saw
him
she
was
troubled
at
his
saying
and
cast
in
her
mind
what
manner
of
salutation
this
should
be
and
the
angel
said
unto
her
fear
not
mary
for
thou
hast
found
favor
with
god
and
behold
thou
shalt
conceive
in
thy
womb
and
bring
forth
a
son
and
shall
call
his
name
jesus
he
shall
be
great
and
shalt
be
called
the
son
of
the
highest
and
the
lord
god
shall
give
unto
him
the
throne
of
his
father
david
and
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
forever
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
end
then
said
mary
unto
the
angel
how
shall
this
be
seeing
i
know
not
a
man
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
her
the
holy
ghost
shall
come
upon
thee
and
the
power
of
the
highest
shall
overshadow
thee
therefore
also
that
holy
thing
which
shall
be
born
of
thee
shall
be
called
the
son
of
god
and
mary
said
behold
the
handmaid
of
the
lord
be
it
unto
me
according
to
thy
word
these
two
the
mother
of
jesus
and
her
betrothed
husband
had
left
their
home
in
nazareth
to
enroll
their
names
as
members
of
the
house
of
david
in
a
census
which
had
been
ordered
by
the
emperor
augustus
and
while
at
bethlehem
mary
was
delivered
of
her
son
the
enrollment
ordered
by
the
emperor
had
called
so
many
strangers
into
the
little
town
of
bethlehem
that
on
the
arrival
of
joseph
and
mary
there
was
no
room
at
the
inn
for
them
and
they
had
to
take
up
quarters

end
of

the
angelic
the
birth
of
christ
was
announced
to
a
few
shepherds
watching
their
flock
by
night
about
a
mile
distant
from
the
village
of
bethlehem
by
an
angel
surrounded
about
by
the
glory
of
god
who
said
fear
not
for
behold
i
bring
you
good
tidings
of
great
joy
which
shall
be
to
all

for
unto

city
of
david
a
savior
which
is
christ
the
lord
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you
ye
shall
find
the
babe
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes
lying
in
a
manger
and
suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
god
and
saying
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
good
will
toward
men
a
visit
to
the
village
confirmed
the
strange
proclamation
of
the
angel
they
found
the
mother
and
child
the
inquiry
of
the
not
alone
by
voice
of
angels
was
the
birth
of
messiah
announced
but
wise
men
from
the
east
who
had
seen
his
star
in
the
firmament
came
to
jerusalem
about
the
time
of
his
birth
inquiring
where
is
he
that
is
born
king
of
the
jews
for
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
are
come
to
worship
him
nor
were
signs
of
messiah
birth
seen
alone
on
the
eastern
hemisphere
to
the
people
of
the
western
hemisphere
signs
were
also
given
a
new
star
did
appear
according
to
the
words
of
the
nephite
prophets
at
zarahemla
the
nephites
saw
it
and
to
them
as
well
as
to
the
wise
men
of
the
east
a
star
announced
the
birth
of
him
who
was
to
be
king
of
the
jews
and
the
savior
of
the
world
another
sign
was
given
to
the
nephites
which
had
also
been
predicted
by
their
prophets
the
night
before
jesus
was
born
remained
beautifully
light
on
the
western
hemisphere
this
event
is
thus
recorded
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
words
which
came
unto
nephi
were
fulfilled
according
as
they
had
been
spoken
for
behold
at
the
going
down
of
the
sun
there
was
no
darkness
and
the
people
began
to
be
astonished
because
there
was
no
darkness
when
the
time
of
night
came
there
was
no
darkness
in
all
that
night
but
it
was
light
as
though
it
was
midday
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sun
did
rise
in
the
morning
again
according
to
its
proper
order
and
they
the
nephites
knew
that
it
was
the
day
that
the
lord
should
be
born
because
of
the
sign
which
had
been
given
the
alarm
of
king
the
inquiry
made
by
the
wise
men
from
the
east
concerning
the
one
who
was
born
king
of
the
jews
alarmed
the
jealousy
of
herod
and
learning
from
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
that
bethlehem
was
the
place
where
the
deliverer
of
israel
was
to
be
born
he
sent
the
wise
men
there
strictly
charging
them
to
search
diligently
and
when
they
had
found
the
child
to
bring
him
word
that
he
too
might
worship
him
on
the
way
to
bethlehem
the
star
they
had
seen
in
the
east
went
before
them
until
it
stood
over
where
the
child
was
they
found
the
babe
with
mary
his
mother
and
they
worshipped
him
giving
him
presents
of
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
they
were
commanded
of
god
in
a
dream
however
not
to
return
to
herod
so
they
departed
into
their
own
country
another
way
joseph
too
after
the
departure
of
the
wise
men
was
warned
in
a
dream
to
flee
out
of
the
land
for
herod
would
seek
the
young
child
to
destroy
him
he
was
commanded
to
go
into
egypt
and
remain
there
until
the
lord
should
call
him
to
return
in
obedience
to
these
divine
commandments
joseph
took

notes
the
year
of
messiah
the
birth
of
christ
was
first
made
an
era
from
which
to
reckon
dates
says
the
learned
translator
of
mosheim
murdock
by
dionysius
exiguus
about
he
supposed
christ
to
have
been
born
on
the
of
december
in
the
year
of
rome
and
this
computation
has
been
followed
in
practice
to
this
day
notwithstanding
the
learned
are
well
agreed
that
it
must
be
incorrect
it
will
be
seen
however
from
what
follows
from
the
same
author
that
all
is
uncertainty
with
the
learned
in
respect
to
this
subject
to
ascertain
the
true
time
of
christ
birth
there
are
two
principal
data
afforded
by
the
evangelists
i
it
is
clear
from
matt
ii
that
christ
was
born
before
the
death
of
herod
the
great
who
died
about
easter
in
the
year
of
rome
or
now
if
christ
was
born
in
the
december
next
before
herod
death
it
must
have
been
in
the
year
of
rome
or
and
of
course
four
if
not
five
years
anterior
to
the
dionysian
or
vulgar
era
ii
it
is
probable
from
luke
iii
that
jesus
was
thirty
years
of
age
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
tiberius
caesar
now
the
reign
of
tiberius
may
be
considered
as
commencing
at
the
time
he
became
sole
emperor
in
august
of
the
year
of
rome
or
as
there
is
some
reason
to
suppose
that
augustus
made
him
partner
in
the
government
two
years
before
he
died
we
may
begin
his
reign
in
the
year
of
rome
the
fifteenth
year
of
tiberius
will
therefore
be
either
the
year
of
rome
or
from
which
deduct
and
we
have
the
year
of
rome
or
for
the
year
of
christ
birth
the
former
two
and
the
latter
four
years
earlier
than
the
dionysian
computation
comparing
these
results
with
those
obtained
from
the
death
of
herod
it
is
generally
supposed
the
true
time
of
christ
birth
was
the
year
of
rome
or
four
years
before
the
vulgar
era
the
conclusion
is
not
certain
because
there
is
uncertainty
in
the
it
is
not
certain
that
we
ought
to
reckon
tiberius
reign
as
beginning
two
years
before
the
death
of
augustus
luke
says
thirty
years
of
age
this
is
indefinite
and
may
be
understood
of
thirty
or
years
it
is
not
certain
in
which
of
the
two
years
mentioned
herod
died
nor
how
long
before
that
event
the
savior
was
born
respecting
the
month
and
day
of
christ
birth
we
are
left
almost
wholly
to
conjecture
it
will
be
demanded
on
what
authority
i
have
gone
counter
to
the
conclusions
of
the
learned
on
this
subject
by
keeping
to
the
dionysian
date
so
far
at
least
as
the
year
is
concerned
my
answer
is
that
in
the
revelation
on
church
government
in
the
doctrine
and
covenants
sec
xx
the
following
in
respect
to
the
rise
of
the
church
is
given
the
rise
of
the
church
of
christ
in
these
last
days
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
years
since
the
coming
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
in
the
it
being
regularly
organized
and
established
agreeable
to
the
laws
of
our
country
by
the
will
and
commandments
of
god
in
the
fourth
month
and
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
month
which
is
called
april
i
believe
that
this
better
than
any
other
authority
fixes
the
time
of
the
birth
or
the
coming
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
in
the
flesh
and
that
as
to
the
year
at
least
agrees
with
the
dionysian
computation
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
revelation
in
section
twenty
of
the
doctrine
and
covenants
was
given
before
the
church
was
organized
at
sundry
times
between
the
first
and
the
sixth
of
april
and
that
the
prophet
was
instructed
to
organize
the
church
on
the
sixth
day
of
april
hence
it
was
not
mere
chance
that
determined
the
day
on
which
that
organization
took
place

star

fact
that
is
significant
in
view
of
the
above
considerations
and
those
which
follow
in

roberts
the
day
of
messiah
strictly
speaking
if
this
church
was
organized
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
years
since
the
coming
of
our
lord
and
savior
in
the
flesh
then
the
sixth
of
april
must
have
been
the
anniversary
of
the
savior
birthday
if
the
organization
of
the
church
had
been
before
or
subsequent
to
that
date
if
only
by
one
or
any
number
of
days
the
great
event
would
have
been
more
or
less
than
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
years
by
just
so
many
days
this
argument
also
holds
good
as
to
the
year
of
birth
options
formed
by
the
study
of
chronological
events
may
or
may
not
be
accurate
but
we
would
scarcely
think
the

would
make
any
mistake
about
dates

of
all
he
who
was
born
on
that
day
and
on
that
day
years
later
was
joseph
smith
let
us
inquire
if
the
day
observed
by
the
christian
world
as
the
day
of
his
christ
birth
the
of
december
is
or
is
not
the
real
christmas
day
a
great
many
authors
have
found
out
from
their
researches
that
it
is
not
i
think
that
there
is
scarcely
an
author
at
the
present
day
that
believes
that
the
of
december
was
the
day
that
christ
was
born
on
it
is
generally
believed
and
conceded
by
the
learned
who
have
investigated
the
matter
that
christ
was
born
in
april
it
is
stated
that
according
to
the
best
of
their
the
learned
judgment
from
the
researches
they
have
made
christ
was
crucified
on
the
sixth
of
april
that
is
the
day
on
which
this
church
was
organized
but
when
these
learned
men
go
back
from
the
day
of
his
crucifixion
to
the
day
of
his
birth
they
are
at
a
loss
having
no
certain
evidence
or
testimony
by
which
they
can
determine
orson
pratt
in
support
of
elder
pratt
contention
relative
to
the
uncertainty
of

scholars
as
to
the

to
his

and
the

which
he
bestowed
on

there

no

who
had
the

respect
for

to
deny

that
he

punishment
he
inflicted
and
the
injuries
he
did
not

to
his
subjects
but
to
his
nearest
relatives
and
takes
notice
of
his
severe
and
unrelenting
disposition
there
he
will
be
forced
to
allow
that

brutish

a
stranger
to

anyone
was

very
obsequious

would
not

but
seemed
to
think
of

he
was
not
able
to
contain
himself
but
prosecuted
his
very
kindred
and
friends
and
punished
them
as
if
they
were
enemies
and
this
wickedness
he
undertook
out
of
a
desire
that
he
might
be
himself

a
man
he
was

which
did

from

the

maintained
that

were
universally

and
they
therefore
gave
the
names

own

the

every

at

to
the

supposed

the
worship
of
these

consisted
in
numerous
ceremonies

the
ceremonies
for
the
most
part
were
absurd
and
ridiculous
and
what
was
worse
yet
debasing
obscene
and
cruel
the
whole
pagan
system
had
not
the
least
efficacy
to
excite
and
cherish
virtuous
emotions
in
the
soul
for
in
the
first
place
the
gods
and
goddesses
to
whom
the
public
homage
was
paid
instead
of
being
patterns
of
virtue
were
patterns
rather
of
enormous
vices
and
crimes
they
were
considered
as
superior
to
mortals
in
power

as
exempt
from
death

in
all
things

the
ministers
of
this
religion
neither
by
precept
nor
by
example
exhorted
the
people
to
lead
honest
and
virtuous
lives
but
gave
them
to
understand
that
all
the
homage
required
of
them
by
the
gods
was
comprised
in
the
observance
of
the
traditional
rites
and
ceremonies
and
lastly
the
doctrines
inculcated
respecting
the
rewards
of
the
righteous
and
the
punishments
of
the
wicked
in
the
future
world
were
some
of
them
dubious
and
uncertain
and
others
more
adapted
to
promote

virtue
hence
the

pagans
themselves
about
the

birth
contemned
and
ridiculed
the
whole
system

contended
by
those
who
would
dignify
paganism
that
back
of
its
common
worship
among
the
orientals
and
greeks
at
least
certain
recondite
and
concealed
rites
called
mysteries
containing
in
them
the
essence
of
true
religion
existed
and
that
back
of
its
idolatry
stood
and
was
recognized
the
true
god
of
which
the
images
worshiped
were
but
the
material
representatives
to
these
mysteries
however
very
few
were
admitted
candidates
for
initiation
had
first
to
give
satisfactory
proof
of
their
good
faith
and
patience
by
various
most
troublesome
ceremonies
when
initiated
they
could
not
divulge
anything
they
had
seen
without
exposing
their
lives
to
imminent
danger
hence
the
interior
of
these
hidden
rites
is
at
this
day
but
little
known
and
therefore
but
an
imperfect
judgment
may
be
formed
as
to
their
virtue
but
what
glimpses
are
obtained
of
the
rites
of
these
mysteries
do
not
prepossess
one
in
their
favor
for
in
many
of
them
many
things
were
done
which
are
repugnant
to
modesty
and
decency
and
in
all
of
them
that
are
known
the
discerning
may
see
that
the
deities
there
worshipped
were
more

former

principles

they
differed
on
questions
of

such
as
related
to

salvation
of

first
they
disagreed
respecting
the

had
given
them
the
pharisees
superadded
to
the
written
law
an
oral
or
unwritten
law
handed
down
by
tradition
which
the
sadducees
rejected
adhering
alone
to
the
written
law
they
differed
too
as
to
the
import
of
the
law
the
pharisees
held
to
a
double
sense
of
the
scripture
the
one
literal
the
other
figurative

the
sadducees
held

literal

others
on

of
the
highest
moment
particularly
in
respect
to

rewards

punishments
announced
in

sacred
writings
the
pharisees
supposed
them
to
affect
both
body
and
spirit
in
whose
and
eternal
existence
they
believed
and
that
punishments
and
rewards
extended
beyond
the
present
life
the
sadducees
believed
in
no
future
retributions
they
were
sceptical
of
the
miraculous
and
denied
the
existence
of
spiritual
beings
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
resurrection
of
the
body
they
were
deists
in
fact
viewing
the
supreme
being
as
a
quiescent
providence
calmly
surveying
and
ruling
the
regular
working
of
natural
laws
they
gave
themselves
up
to
ease
luxury
and
were
not
indisposed
to
view
with
indifferent
liberality
the
laxity
of
heathen
morals
and
the
profanity
of
idol
worship
they
included
in
their
numbers
the
leading
men
of
the
nation
were
the
aristocracy
in

while
the
pharisees
on
the
other
hand
were
the
common
people
proud
of
their
unblemished
descent
from
abraham
exclusive
formal
strict
observers
of

even
beyond

were
the

there
were

they
were

sadducees

and
there
was
no
known
remedy
for
the
horror
and
ruin
which
it
was
causing
in
a
thousand
hearts
remorse
itself
seemed
to
be
exhausted
so
that
men
were
past
feeling
there
was
a
callosity
of
heart
a
petrifying
of
the
moral
sense
which
even
those
who
suffered
from
it
felt
to
be
abnormal
and
portentous
even
the
heathen
world
felt
that
the
fullness
of
the
time
had
canon
farrar
policy
of
rome
in
respect
to
the
policy
of
the
emperors
and
the
senate
so
far
as
it
concerned
religion
was
happily
seconded
by
the
reflections
of
the
enlightened
and
by
the
habits
of
the
superstitious
part
of
their
subjects
the
various
modes
of
worship
which
prevailed
in
the
roman
world
were
all
considered
by
the
people
as
equally
true
by
the
philosopher
as
equally
false
and
by
the
magistrate
as
equally
useful
and
this
toleration
produced
not
only
mutual
indulgence
but
even
religious
concord
avarice
and
taste
very
frequently
despoiled
the
vanquished
nations
of
the
elegant
statues
of
their
gods
and
the
rich
ornaments
of
their
temples
but
in
the
exercise
of
the
religion
which
they
derived
from
their
ancestors
they
uniformly
experienced
the
indulgence
and
even
protection
of
the
roman
conquerors
the
province
of
gaul
seems
and
indeed
only
seems
an
exception
to
this
universal
toleration
under
the
specious
pretext
of
abolishing
human
sacrifices
the
emperors
tiberius
and
claudius
suppressed
the
dangerous
power
of
the
druids
but
the
priests
themselves
their
gods
and
their
altars
subsisted
in
peaceful
obscurity
till
the
final
fall
of
paganism
rome
gradually
became
the
common
temple
of
her
subjects
and
the
freedom
of
the
city
was
bestowed
on
all
the
gods
of
gibbon
mysteries
of
the
pagan
it
has
been
maintained
that
the
design
of
at
least
some
of
these
mysteries
was
to
inculcate
the
grand
principles
of
natural
religion
such
as
the
unity
of
god
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
importance
of
virtue
and
to
explain
the
vulgar
polytheism
as
symbolical
of
these
great
truths
but
this
certainly
needs
better
proof
it
is
more
probable
that
the
later
pagan
philosophers
who
lived
after
the
light
of
christianity
had
exposed
the
abominations
of
polytheism
were
the
principal
authors
of
this
moral
interpretation
of
the
vulgar
religion
which
they
falsely
pretended
was
taught
in
the
mysteries
while
in
reality
those
mysteries
were
probably
mere
supplements
to
the
vulgar
mythology
and
worship
and
of
the
same
general
character

of

all

that

jesus
when

him
he
hesitated
and
knowing
by
the
inspiration
within
him
what
he
was
soon
to
know
by
a
more
splendid
manifestation
of
god
power
that
this
was
the
son

said
i
have
need

thee
and
comest
thou
to
me
suffer
it
to
be
so
now
replied
jesus
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
then
john
baptized
him
and
as
jesus
came
up
out
of
the

the

were
opened
unto
him

unto
john
see

and
he
saw
the
spirit
of
god
descending
like
a
dove
and
lighting
upon
him
and
he
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
this
splendid
spiritual
manifestation
was
a
sign
to
john
that
this
was
the
son
of
god
the
one
who
was
to
baptize
with
fire
and
the
holy
ghost

was

away

it

have
her
herod
at
the
instance
of
herodias
cast
john
into
prison
for
his
temerity
in
reproving
their
wicked
course
and
would
have
put
him
to
death
but
he
feared
the
multitude
who
esteemed

revengeful
spirit
of

however
was
not
satisfied
with

bonds

determined
to
have
his
life
on

in

she
sent
her

to
dance
for

amusement

which
greatly
pleased
herod
and
he
promised
her
with
an
oath
that
he
would
give
her
whatsoever
she
should
ask
and
the
damsel
being
instructed
of
her
mother
demanded
the
head

it
was
with
sorrow
that
herod
bad
as
he
was
heard
this
demand
yet
for
his
oath

and
ashamed
to
manifest
weakness

spoke
a

which
was
rough
harsh
and
uncouth
having

so
was

a

being
a

obscure

place
accordingly
its
inhabitants
were
held
in

consideration
by

of
course
by

that
the

understood
this
institution
to
prefigure
the
sufferings
of
the
christ
is
evident
not

from
the

from
the

things
said

in

hymn
composed
of

songs

is
the
suffering
of

for
which
they
refer

also
denotes
the
whole
solemnity
commencing
on
the
fourteenth
and
ending
on
the
day
of
kitto
the
youth
of
it
is
written
that
there
was
once
a
pious
godly
bishop
who
had
often
earnestly
prayed
that
god
would
manifest
unto
him
what
jesus
had
done
in
his
youth
once
the
bishop
had
a
dream
to
this
effect
he
seemed
in
his
sleep
to
see
a
carpenter
working
at
his
trade
and
beside
him
a
little
boy
who
was
gathering
up
chips
then
came
in
a
maiden
clothed
in
green
who
called
them
both
to
come
to
the
meal
and
set
porridge
before
them
all
this
the
bishop
seemed
to
see
in
his
dream
himself
standing
behind
the
door
that
he
might
not
be
perceived
then
the
little
boy
began
and
said
why
does
that
man
stand
there
shall
he
not
also
eat
with
us
and
this
so
frightened
the
bishop
that
he
awoke
let
this
be
what
it
may
a
true
history
or
a
fable
i
none
the
less
believe
that
christ
in
his
childhood
and
youth
looked
and
acted
like
other
children
yet
without
sin
in
fashion
like
a
martin
luther
messiah
life
for
thirty
what
was
his
manner
of
life
during
those
thirty
years
it
is
a
question
which
the
christians
can
not
help
asking
in
deep
reverence
and
with
yearning
love
but
the
words
in
which
the
gospels
answer
it
are
very
calm
and
very
few
his
development
was
a
strictly
human
development
he
did
not
come
to
the
world
endowed
with
infinite
knowledge
but
as
luke
tells
us
he
gradually
advanced
in
wisdom
he
was
not
clothed
with
infinite
power
but
experienced
the
weakness
and
imperfections
of
human
infancy
he
grew
as
other
children
grow
only
in
a
childhood
of
stainless
and
sinless
beauty
as
the
flower
of
roses
in
the
spring
of
the
year
and
as
lilies
by
the
waters
it
was
in
utter
stillness
in
prayerfulness
in
the
quiet
round
of
daily
duties
like
moses
in
the
wilderness
like
david
among
the
sheep
folds
like
elijah
among
the
tents
of
the
bedouin
like
jeremiah
in
his
quiet
home
at
anathoth
like
amos
in
the
sycamore
groves
of
tekoa
that
the
boy
jesus
prepared
himself
amid
a
hallowed
obscurity
for
his
mighty
work
on
earth
his
outward
life
was
the
life
of
all
those
of
his
age
and
station
and
place
of
birth
he
lived
as
lived
other
children
of
peasant
parents
in
that
quiet
town
and
in
great
measure
as
they
live
canon
farrar
was
john
the
elias
art
thou
elias
said
the
messengers
from
jesus
to
john
and
he
saith
i
am
not
john
i
afterwards
as
jesus
peter
james
and
john
were
descending
the
mountain
on
whose
summit
they
had
seen
in
vision
moses
and
elias
the
following
conversation
occurred
jesus
tell
the
vision
to
no
man
until
the
son
of
man
be
risen
again
from
the
dead
disciples
why
then
say
the
scribes
that
elias
must
first
come
jesus
elias
truly
shall
first
come
restore
all
but
i
say
unto
you
that
elias
is
come
already
and
they
knew
him
not
but
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
listed
then
the
disciples
knew
that
he
spake
unto
them
of
john
the
baptist
matt
xvii
from
this
it
appears
that
john
denied
being
elias
while
jesus
declared
that
he
was
and
in
consequence
much
controversy
has
arisen
on
this
subject
the
matter
may
be
easily
understood
however
when
it
is
known
that
elias
is
the
name
of
a
person
the
name
of
a
prophet
who
lived
doubtless
in
the
days
of
abraham
doc
and
cov
sec
cx
and
who
also
appeared
to
jesus
on
the
occasion
above
named
elias
is
also
the
name
of
an
office
the
office
of
restorer
the
spirit
of
elias
said
the
prophet
joseph
march
is
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
greater
revelation
of
god
which
is
the
priesthood
of
elias
and
when
god
sends
a
man
into
the
world
to
prepare
for
a
greater
work
holding
the
keys
of
the
power
of
elias
it
was
called
the
doctrine
of
elias
even
from
the
early
ages
of
the
world
hence
any
man
who
came
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
greater
revelation
was
an
elias
and
in
this
sense
john
the
baptist
was
elias
but
it
is
equally
true
that
he
was
elias
the
prophet
who
lived
in
the
days
of
abraham
who
appeared
unto
jesus
in
the
mountain
and
who
also
appeared
to
the
prophet
joseph
and
oliver
cowdery
in
the
kirtland
temple
in
the
revision
of
the
new
testament
by
the
prophet
joseph
smith
often
improperly
called
the
new
translation
the
difficulty
in
respect
to
the
denial
of
john
that
he
was
elias
is
easily
understood
we
quote
the
passage
this
is
the
record
of
john
when
the
jews
sent
priests
and
seventies
from
jerusalem
to
ask
him
who
art
thou
and
he
confessed
and
denied
not
that
he
was
elias
but
he
confessed
saying
i
am
not
the
christ
and
they
asked
him
saying
how
art
thou
then
elias
and
he
said
am
not
that
elias
who
was
to
restore
all
and
they
asked
him
saying
art
thou
that
prophet
and
he
answered
no
john
i
from
the
above
it
may
be
plainly
seen
that
while
john
was
not
the
particular
elias
who
is
to
restore
things
yet
he
is
an
elias
because
he
restored
some
things
in
respect
to
the
roberts
john
the
only
witness
of
the
descent
of
the
holy
i
suppose
that
john
the
baptist
was
the
only
one
who
was
a
witness
of
the
holy
ghost
resting
upon
jesus
in
the
form
of
a
dove
in
all
the
accounts
given
of
this
event
except
by
luke
the
pronoun
he
referring
to
john
is
used
while
in
luke
it
is
not
said
that
anyone
else
saw
it
but
it
is
merely
stated
that
the
holy
ghost
descended
in
a
bodily
shape
like
a
dove
upon
him
john
own
testimony
is
as
follows
i
saw
the
spirit
descending
from
heaven
like
a
dove
and
it
abode
upon
him
and
i
knew
him
not
but
he
that
sent
me
to
baptize
with
water
the
same
said
unto
me
upon
whom
thou
shalt

yet
jesus
claimed
that
he
came
not
to
destroy
the
law
nor
the
prophets
but
to
fulfill
them
and
declared
that
though
heaven
and
earth
should
pass
away
not
one
jot
nor
tittle
of
the
law
should
pass
away
but
all
should
be
fulfilled
still
it
can
not
be
denied
that
some
of
his
teachings
set
aside
many
parts
of
the
law
of
moses
and
seemed
to
be
in
conflict
with
its
spirit
the
gospel
supplants
the
the
seeming
conflict
referred
to
in
the
last
paragraph
between
the
law
of
moses
and
the
teachings
of
messiah
disappears
when
it
is
understood
that
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
was
about
to
supplant
the
law
the
gospel
under
moses
was
offered
to
ancient
israel
before
they
received
the
law
of
carnal
commandments
but
they
would
not
live
in
accordance
with
its
divine
precepts
but
hardened
their
hearts
against
it
until
the
gospel
as
also
the
higher
priesthood
was
taken
from
among
them
the
lesser
priesthood
which
holds
the
keys
of
the
ministering
of
angels
and
the
preparatory
gospel
repentance
and
baptism
and
the
law
of
carnal
commandments
the
spirit
of
which
is
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
remained
with
them
to
educate
and
instruct
them
that
they
might
be
prepared
eventually
for
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
when
jesus
began
his
ministry
by
proclaiming
his
gospel
the
law
of
moses
was
about
fulfilled
and
many
of
the
carnal
commandments
and
precepts
were
being
pushed
aside
by
the
more
excellent
precepts
of
the
gospel
even
as
many
of
the
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
were
to
be
discontinued
after
messiah
should
be
offered
up
as
a
sacrifice

the
sacrifices

twelve
apostles
from
among

perhaps
to
distinguish
him
from
james
the

because
of
his
small
stature
lebbaeus
usually
called
by
his
surname
thaddaeus
simon
the
canaanite
judas
iscariot
who
betrayed
him
these
twelve
men
jesus
sent
out
on
a
mission
to
the
cities
of
israel
forbidding
them
to
go
into
the
way
of
the
gentiles
or
into
the
cities
of
the
samaritans
their
mission
was
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
they
were
sent
without
purse
and
without
scrip
nor
were
they
to
provide
themselves
with
two
coats
nor
take
thought
as
to
what
they
should
eat
or
wherewithal
they
would
be
clothed
but
they
were
to
trust
to
the
lord
being
assured
that
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
the
burden
of
their
message
was
to
be
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
they
also
received
power
from
their
master
to
heal
the
sick
cleanse
the
lepers
raise
the
dead
cast
out
devils
and
were
admonished
since
they
had
received
freely
to
give
as
freely
to
others
jesus
told
them
they
were
going
as
sheep
among
wolves
that
they
would
be
brought
before
governors
and
kings
for
his
sake
that
they
would
be
delivered
up
to
councils
and
scourged
in
the
synagogues
that
they
would
be
hated
of
all
men
for
his
sake
but
they
were
also
given
the
comforting
assurance
that
they
who
would
endure
to
the
end
should
be
saved
these
apostles
went
forth
through
the
towns
of
judea

the
gospel
and

sick
seventies
the
harvest
being
great
and
the
laborers
few
jesus
called
seventies
into
the
ministry
to
aid
the
twelve
apostles
he
sent
them
two
and
two
before
him
into
every
city
and
place
where
he
himself
expected
to
go
the
commission
powers
and
instructions
which
the
seventies
received
were
nearly
the
same
as
those
given
to
the
twelve
apostles
these
seventies
went
forth
as
the
apostles
had
done
and
returning
from
their
labor
bore
record
that
the
power
of
god
was
with
them
in
their
ministry
and
that
the
very
devils
were
subject
to
them
in
the
name
of
jesus
the
order
of
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
relate
even
the
chief
events
in
the
life
of
messiah
in
the
order
in
which
they
occurred
since
no
little
confusion
exists
in
respect
to
the
succession
of
events
in
the
narratives
of
the
new
testament
see

end
of

nor
is
it
necessary
to
our
purpose
to
dwell
in
detail
or
in
sequence
upon
those
matters
it
is
sufficient
for
us
to
know
that
after
the
events
we
have
already
noted
messiah
mission
was
more
boldly
declared
he
proclaimed
himself
to
be
the
son
of
god
the
messiah
of
which
the
scriptures
had
borne
record
he
taught
men
that
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
to
redeem
it
that
whosoever
would
believe
in
him
might
have
everlasting
life
in
addition
to
this
great
doctrine
we
have
seen
that
he
taught
repentance
he
likewise
taught
that
men
must
be
born
baptized
of
the
water
and
of
the
spirit
before
they
could
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
he
made
and
baptized
more
disciples
than
john
he
also
taught
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
announced
himself
as
possessing
the
keys
and
powers
thereof
the
divinity
of
messiah
jesus
sustained
the
divinity
of
his
mission
by
pointing
to
the
conformity
of
the
facts
connected
with
his
career
with
the
predictions
of
the
scriptures
by
the
testimony
which
john
the
baptist
bore
by
the
works
which
he
did
his
wonderful
miracles
wherein
the
power
of
god
was
made
manifest
and
lastly
and
best
of
all
the
testimony
of
the
father
himself
which
was
promised
unto
all
those
who
would
do
his
the
father
will
notes
order
of
the
the
order
of
the
temptations
is
given
differently
by
matthew
and
luke
matthew
placing
second
the
scene
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
luke
the
vision
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
both
orders
can
not
be
right
and
possibly
luke
may
have
been
influenced
in
his
arrangement
by
the
thought
that
a
temptation
to
spiritual
pride
and
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
miraculous
power
was
a
subtler
and
less
transparent
and
therefore
more
powerful
one
than
the
temptation
to
fall
down
and
recognize
the
power
of
evil
the
consideration
that
matthew
as
one
of
the
apostles
is
more
likely
to
have
heard
the
narrative
immediately
from
the
lips
of
christ
gives
greater
weight
to
the
order
which
he
canon
farrar
more
than
three
the
positive
temptations
of
jesus
were
not
confined
to
that
particular
point
of
time
when
they
assailed
him
with
concentrated
force
in
the
wilderness
but
still
more
frequently
in
after
life
was
he
called
to
endure
temptation
of
another
kind
the
temptation
of
suffering
and
this
culminated
on
two
occasions
in
the
conflict
of
gethsemane
and
in
that
moment
of
agony
on
the
cross
when
he
cried
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
ullman
manner
of
christ
next
to
what
our
savior
taught
may
be
considered
the
manner
of
his
teaching
which
was
extremely
peculiar
yet
i
think
precisely
adapted
to
the
peculiarity
of
his
character
and
situation
his
lessons
did
not
consist
of
disquisitions
of
anything
like
moral
essays
or
like
sermons
or
like
set
treatises
upon
several
points
which
he
mentioned
when
he
delivered
a
precept
it
was
seldom
that
he
added
any
proof
or
argument
still
more
seldom
that
he
accompanied
it
with
what
all
precepts
require
limitations
and
distinctions
his
instructions
were
conceived
in
short
emphatic
sententious
rules
in
occasional
reflections
or
in
sound
maxims
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
natural
or
would
it
have
been
a
proper
method
for
a
philosopher
or
a
moralist
or
that
it
is
a
method
which
can
be
successfully
imitated
by
us
but
i
contend
that
it
was
suitable
to
the
character
which
christ
assumed
and
to
the
situation
in
which
as
a
teacher
he
was
placed
he
produced
himself
as
a
messenger
from
god
he
put
the
truth
of
what
he
taught
upon
authority
i
say
unto
you
swear
not
at
all
i
say
unto
you
resist
not
evil
i
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
in
the
choice
therefore
of
his
mode
of
teaching
the
purpose
by
him
to
be
consulted
was
because
conviction
which
forms
the
principal
end
of
our
discourse
was
to
arise
in
the
minds
of
his
followers
from
a
different
source
from
their
respect
to
his
person
and
authority
now
for
the
purpose
of
impression
singly
and
exclusively
i
know
nothing
which
would
have
so
great
force
as
strong
ponderous
maxims
frequently
urged
and
frequently
brought
back
to
the
thoughts
of
the
hearers
i
know
nothing
that
could
in
this
view
be
said
better
than
do
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
others
should
do
unto
you
the
first
and
great
commandment
is
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
and
the
second
is
like
unto
it
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor

paley
the
law
added
to
the
the
mosaic
law
never
was
considered
by
those
who
understood
it
an
everlasting
covenant
it
was
given
for
a
special
purpose
and
when
it
had
accomplished
that
purpose
it
was
laid
aside
we
read
in
galatians
that
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
abraham
saying
in
thee
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
from
this
it
appears
that
the
gospel
was
preached
unto
abraham
in
hebrews
paul
speaking
of
ancient
israel
says
for
unto
us
was
the
gospel
preached
as
well
as
unto
them
ancient
israel
but
the
word
preached
did
not
profit
them
not
being
mixed
with
faith
in
them
that
heard
it
not
only
then
was
the
gospel
preached
unto
abraham
but
also
unto
the
children
of
israel
now
let
us
go
back
to
the
third
chapter
of
galatians
for
paul
having
stated
that
the
gospel
was
preached
unto
abraham
asks
this
question
verse
wherefore
then
serveth
the
law
if
the
gospel
was
preached
unto
abraham
it
was
added
because
of
transgression
till
the
seed
christ
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made
added
added
to
what
added
to
the
gospel
which
before
that
time
had
been
preached
unto
abraham
and
also
to
ancient
israel
but
the
israelites
under
moses
were
unable
to
live
the
perfect
law
of
the
gospel
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
overcome
evil
with
good
as
the
gospel
requires
so
a
law
of
carnal
commandments
was
added
to
the
gospel
a
law
which
breathed
of
the
spirit
of
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
a
law
which
was
suited
to
their
capacity
paul
speaking
of
this
subject
in
the
same
chapter
of
galatians
verses
says
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
under
the
law
shut
up
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
revealed
wherefore
the
law
the
law
of
moses
was
our
to
bring
us
unto
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
but
after
that
faith
has
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
from
these
passages
of
scripture
we
learn
this
the
gospel
was
preached
unto
abraham
and
also
unto
ancient
israel
the
israelites
were
unable
to
live
the
law
of
the
gospel
hence
a
law
of
carnal
commandments
known
as
the
law
of
moses
was
given
as
a
to
bring
them
up
to
a
higher
law
christ
came
and
introduced
that
higher
law
the
gospel
explained
its
principles
and
pointed
out
the
difference
between
it
and
the
law
of
moses
the
gospel
took
the
place
of
the
law
of
moses
which
was
laid
aside
having
fulfilled
the
object
for
which
it
was
added
to
the
lecture
on
mission
of
joseph
smith
roberts
neglect
of
chronological
order
in
new
testament
the
four
gospels
narrate
the
principal
events
connected
with
our
lord
abode
on
earth
from
his
birth
to
his
ascension
there
must
therefore
be
a
general
resemblance
between
them
though
that
of
john
contains
little
in
common
with
the
others
being
apparently
supplementary
to
them
yet
there
are
considerable
diversities
both
in
the
order
in
which
facts
are
narrated
and
in
the
facts
themselves
hence
the
difficulty
of
weaving
the
accounts
of
the
four
into
a
continuous
and
chronological
history
it
is
our
decided
conviction
that
all
the
evangelists
have
not
adhered
to
chronological
arrangement
the
question
then
arises
have
all
neglected
the

the
mission
of
jesus
was
full
of
comfort
to
the
poor
as
one
of
the
signs
that
he
was
the
promised
messiah
he
said
to
a
delegation
of
john
disciples
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
them
he
claimed
to
be
anointed
of
the
lord
to
that
work
and
in
doing
it
was
fulfilling
that
which
had
been
predicted
by
the
prophets
he
often
reproved
the
rich
not
merely
because
they
were
rich
however
but
because
of
their
pride
and
hypocrisy
which
led
them
to
oppress
the
poor
in
like
manner
he
reproved
the
chief
elders
and
scribes
and
pharisees
who
loved
fine
clothing
and
loved
to
receive
salutations
in
the
market
places
who
coveted
the
chief
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
uppermost
rooms
at
the
feasts
who
devoured
widows
houses
and
for
a
pretense
made
long
prayers
this
with
a
free
reproof
of
their
other
vices
and
crimes
brought
upon
him
the
enmity
of
the
wealthy
and
of
the
rulers
of
the
people

the
common
people
heard
him

end
of
section
religious
jealousy
political
another
thing
which
embittered
the
minds
of
the
chief
priests
and
elders
against
jesus
was
religious
jealousy
the
numerous
evidences
of
his
divine
authority
to
be
seen
in
his
character
and
works
led
many
of
the
jews
to
revere
him
as
the
son
of
god
especially
was
this
the
case
after
he
raised
lazarus
from
the
dead
they
said
if
we
let
this
man
alone
all
men
will
believe
in
him
and
the
romans
will
come
and
take
away
both

it
was
religious
jealousy
that
dictated

first
half
of
the
sentence
and
political
fear
the
rest
the
jews
had
but
a
precarious
hold
upon
their
political
rights
already
it
had
been
intimated
that
jesus
was
king
of
the
jews
and
if
the
people
should
under
a
sudden
impulse
accept
him
as
king
the
result
in
their
judgment
must
be

the
night

jesus
with

ate

took

also
took
wine
gave

as
he
gave
it
to
them
this

is
the

testament
in
my
blood

is
shed

after

supper
was
over
having
sung
a
hymn
jesus
with
the
twelve
excepting
judas
iscariot
went
out
to
the
garden
of
gethsemane

jesus
prayed
in
great
agony
of
spirit
so
that
he
sweat
great
drops
of
blood
he
prayed
that
the
bitter
cup
of
suffering

might
be
removed
from
him

judas
iscariot
having

out

went
to

directed
a
multitude
with
a
company
of
roman
soldiers
to
the
garden
and
running
to
jesus
cried
hail
master

kissed
him

agreed
upon

traitor

who
came
to
make

him

they
sought
for
witnesses

would
testify
something
against
him

would
furnish
a
pretext
for
putting
him
to
death
many
false
witnesses
testified
against
him

their
testimony
was
unsatisfactory

failed

evidently
losing
patience
at
the
silence
of
the
prisoner

he
made
no

him

the

claimed
that

was
guilty

because
he
claimed
to
be
the
son

answer

love
of
self
indulgence

destitute

having
no

they
act

the

hours
in

while
jesus
hung
upon
the
cross
from
the
sixth
hour
there
was
darkness
over
all
the
land
to
the
ninth
hour
most
of
the
ancient
commentators
believed
that
this
darkness
extended
to
the
whole
world
but
their
arguments
are
now
seldom
regarded
as
satisfactory
and
their
proofs
even
less
so
of
the
latter
the
strongest
is
the
mention
of
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
which
is
referred
to
this
time
by
phlegon
trallianus
and
after
him
by
thallus
but
even
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
could
not
be
visible
to
the
whole
world
and
neither
of
these
writers
names
the
places
of
the
eclipse
some
think
it
was
rome
but
it
is
impossible
that
an
eclipse
could
have
happened
from
the
sixth
to
the
ninth
hour
both
at
rome
and
jerusalem
that
the
darkness
could
not
have
proceeded
from
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
is
further
placed
beyond
all
doubt
by
the
fact
that
it
being
then
the
time
of
the
passover
the
moon
was
at
the
full
this
darkness
may
therefore
be
ascribed
to
an
extraordinary
and
preternatural
obscuration
of
the
solar
light
which
might
precede
and
accompany
the
earthquake
which
took

should
come

them
from
punishment
it
was
in

way

the
disappearance

was

forty
days
after

during

time
he
taught
them
all
things
pertaining

and
authorized
them
to
go

creature

them
in
the
name
of
the
father

of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
he
had
commanded
them
and
promised
that
he
would
be
with
them
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
moreover
he
told
them
that
these
signs
should
follow
them
that
believed
in
his
name
they
should
cast
out
devils
they
should
speak
with
new
tongues
take
up
serpents
and
even
if
they
drank
any
deadly
thing

should

they
should

the
people

hemisphere
organized
his
church
and
commissioned
his
apostles
to
teach
the
gospel
to
all
nations
he
prepared
to
depart
from
them
it
was
most
probably
at
bethany
that
this
solemn
parting
occurred
his
forerunner
john
the
baptist
had
promised
that
he
who
should
come
after
him
jesus
christ
would
baptize
them
with
the
holy
ghost
and
just
previous
to
leaving
the
apostles
he
told
them
that
the
promise
was
about
to
be
fulfilled
he
therefore
commanded
them
to
tarry
in
jerusalem
until
they
were
endowed
with
that
power
from
on
high
then
he
lifted
up
his
hands
and
blessed
them
after
which
he
was
parted
from
them
and
a
cloud
received
him
out
of
their
sight
as
they
were
still
looking
steadfastly
toward
heaven
two
men
angels
in
white
apparel
stood
by
them
and
declared
that
this
same
jesus
whom
they
had
seen
go
into
heaven
should
come
in
like
manner
that
is
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
in
great
glory
the
appearing
of
messiah
to
the
jesus
before
his
crucifixion
told
his
disciples
at
jerusalem
that
he
was
the
good
shepherd
that
would
lay
down
his
life
for
the
sheep
he
told
them
plainly
also
that
he
had
other
sheep
which
were
not
of
that
fold
them
also
i
must
bring
said
he
and
they
must
hear
my
voice
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
this
saying
like
many
others
which
he
delivered
to
them
the
apostles
did
not
understand
because
of
their
unbelief
and
because
of
their
unbelief
and
their
stiffneckedness
jesus
was
commanded
by
his
father
to
say
no
more
to
them
about
it
but
it
was
the
nephites
on
the
continent
of
america
whom
jesus
had
in
mind
when
he
uttered
the
saying
recorded
in
john
gospel
other
sheep
i
have
which
are
not
of
this
fold
etc
what
length
of
time
intervened
between
messiah
departure
from
his
disciples
at
jerusalem
and
his
appearance
among
the
nephites
is
not
known
it
was
not
however
until
after
he
had
ascended
into
heaven
his
appearing
to
them
was
in
this
manner
the
few
people
upon
the
western
hemisphere
and
they
were
the
more
righteous
part
both
of
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
who
survived
that
terrible
period
of
destruction
which
lasted
during
the
time
that
jesus
hung
upon
the
cross
and
the
three
succeeding
days
of
darkness
were
gathered
together
about
the
temple
in
the
land
bountiful
and
as
they
were
pointing
out
to
each
other
the
changes
that
had
occurred
because
of
the
earthquakes
and
other
convulsions
of
the
elements
while
the
messiah
suffered
upon
the
cross
they
heard
a
voice
speaking
unto
them
as
if
from
heaven
they
at
first
did
not
understand
the
voice
they
heard
but
the
third
time
it
spoke
they
understood
it
and
it
made
their
hearts
burn
within
them
and
their
whole
frame
to
quake
and
these
are
the
words
which
the
voice
spake
behold
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
in
whom
i
have
glorified
my
name
hear
ye
him
and
looking
up
into
heaven
from
whence
the
voice
came
they
saw
a
man
descending
clothed
in
a
white
robe
the
multitude
were
breathlessly
silent
for
they
supposed
an
angel
had
appeared
unto
them
but
as
soon
as
jesus
was
in
their
midst
he
stretched
out
his
arm
and
said
behold
i
am
jesus
christ
whom
the
prophets
testified
should
come
into
the
world
i
am
the
light
and
life
of
the
world
and
i
have
drunk
out
of
that
bitter
cup
which
the
father
hath
given
me
and
have
glorified
the
father
in
taking
upon
me
the
sins
of
the
world
at
this
announcement
the
people
fell
prostrate
and
worshiped
him
but
he
commanded
them
to
arise
and
come
unto
him
that
they
might
thrust
their
hands
into
his
side
and
feel
the
prints
of
the
nails
in
his
hands
and
in
his
feet
that
they
might
know
that
he
was
the
god
of
israel
and
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
who
had
been
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world
see
notes
and
end
of
section
this
the
people
did
and
then
again
they
worshiped
him
and
shouted
aloud
hosanna
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
most
high
god
the
church
established
in
after
these
things
jesus
proceeded
to
teach
them
his
gospel
and
establish
his
church
among
them
it
will
be
sufficient
to
say
here
that
the
messiah
taught
the
people
on
the
western
continent
the
same
great
moral
truths
that
he
taught
the
jews
that
he
established
the
same
ordinances
for
the
salvation
of
the
people
that
he
chose
twelve
apostles
to
whom
he
committed
power
to
preach
his
gospel
and
administer
in
its
ordinances
that
a
church
was
organized
which
was
called
the
church
of
christ
that
jesus
bore
record
of
the
great
truth
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
that
the
saints
enjoyed
the
same
spiritual
graces
and
powers
that
the
church
in
palestine
did
only
more
abundantly
because
of
their
greater
faith
that
two
years
after
the
appearance
of
messiah
all
the
people
on
the
continent
accepted
the
gospel
and
were
baptized
that
they
had
all
things
common
and
were
a
blessed
and
prosperous
people
among
whom
were
no
strifes
or
jealousies
or
contentions
and
every
man
did
deal
justly
one
with
another
they
increased
rapidly
in
numbers
and
went
forth
and
built
up
the
waste
places
and
rebuilded
many
of
the
cities
which
had
been
ruined
by
the
earthquakes
and
by
fires
they
walked
no
more
after
the
ordinances
of
the
law
of
moses
but
they
practiced
the
principles
of
the
doctrines
of
the
gospel
of
christ
and
thus
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
passed
away
all
the
members
of
the
first
quorum
of
the
twelve
whom
jesus
called
on
the
western
hemisphere
died
within
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
except
the
three
to
whom
he
had
granted
the
privilege
as
he
did
unto
john
the
beloved
disciple
of
remaining
on
the
earth
until
he
should
come
in
his
glory
the
places
of
those
who
died
were
filled
by
ordaining
others
and
thus
the
quorum
of
apostles
was
perpetuated
notes
the
gospels
but
fragmentary
although
skeptics
have
dwelt
with
disproportioned
persistency
upon
a
multitude
of
discrepancies
in
the
narrative
of
christ
trial
condemnation
death
and
resurrection
yet
these
are
not
of
a
nature
to
cause
the
slightest
anxiety
to
a
christian
scholar
nor
need
they
awaken
the
most
momentary
distrust
in
anyone
who
even
if
he
have
no
deeper
feelings
in
the
matter
approaches
the
gospels
with
no
preconceived
theory
whether
of
infallibility
or
of
dishonesty
to
support
and
merely
accept
them
for
that
which
at
the
lowest
they
claim
to
be
histories
honest
and
faithful
up
to
the
full
knowledge
of
the
writers
each
if
taken
alone
confessedly
fragmentary
and
obviously
after
repeated
study
i
declare
quite
fearlessly
that
though
the
slight
variations
are
numerous
though
the
lesser
particulars
can
not
in
every
instance
be
rigidly
and
minutely
accurate
though
no
one
of
the
narratives
taken
singly
would
give
us
an
adequate
impression
yet
so
far
from
there
being
in
this
part
of
the
gospel
story
any
irreconcilable
contradiction
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
discover
how
one
evangelist
supplements
the
details
furnished
by
another
and
perfectly
possible
to
understand
the
true
sequence
of
the
incidents
by
combining
into
one
whole
the
separate
indications
which
they
the
bible
corrupted
by
the
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
beheld
that
they
the
gentiles
did
prosper
in
the
land
america
and
i
beheld
a
book
the
bible
and
it
was
carried
forth
among
them
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
book
and
i
said
unto
him
i
know
not
and
he
said
unto
me
the
book
which
thou
beholdest
is
a
record
of
the
jews
which
contains
the
covenants
of
the
lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
israel
thou
hast
beheld
that
the
book
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
jew
and
when
it
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
the
jew
it
contained
the
plainness
of
the
gospel
of
the
lord
of
whom
the
twelve
apostles
bear
record
and
they
bear
record
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
lamb
of
god
wherefore
these
things
go
forth
from
the
jews
in
purity
unto
the
gentiles
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
god
and
after
they
go
forth
by
the
hand
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
from
the
jews
unto
the
gentiles
thou
seest
the
foundation
of
a
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
most
abominable
above
all
other
churches
for
behold
they
have
taken
away
from
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
many
parts
which
are
plain
and
most
precious
and
also
many
covenants
of
the
lord
have
they
taken
away
and
all
this
have
they
done
that
they
might
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
that
they
might
blind
the
eyes
and
harden
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
because
of
these
things
which
are
taken
away
out
of
the
gospel

missing
parts
of
the
no
better
evidence
can
be
given
that
the
jewish
scriptures
are
fragmentary
and
corrupted
than
the
fact
that
reference
is
made
in
them
to
books
and
scriptures
which
are
not
now
extant
that
have
been
destroyed
the
following
are
a
such
references
taken

scripture

that

heathen
through
faith
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
abraham
gal
the
christian
world
says
moses
was
first
pen
but
it
appears
from
the
above
quotation
that
some
one
wrote
scriptures
even
before
abraham
days
and
he
read
them
learned
the
gospel
from
them
and
also
learned
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
of
speaking
of
characters
who
were
like
raging
waves
of
the
sea
foaming
out
their

shame
jude
says

also
the

prophesied
of
these
saying
behold
the

cometh
with
ten
thousand
of
his

from
this
it
appears
that
enoch
had
a
revelation
concerning
the
glorious
coming
of
the
son
of
god
to
judgment
may
not
the
prophecy
of
enoch
have
been
among
the
scripture
with
which
abraham

acquainted

not
the

our
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
is
really
not
the
first
since
paul
in
it
speaks
of
a
former
letter
he
had
written
and
which
was
doubtless
as
good
scripture
as
the
two
which
have
been

a

the

of

says

in

was
quetzalcoatl
the
gentle
god

of
the
air
controller
of
the
sun
and
rain
and
source
of
all
prosperity
from
toward
the
rising

quetzalcoatl
had
come
and
he
was
white
with
large
eyes
and
long
black
hair
and
copious
beard
he
finally
set
out
for
some
other
country
and
as
he
departed
from
them
his
last
words
were
that
one
day
bearded
white
men
brethren
of
his
perhaps
he
himself
would
come
by
way
of
the
sea
in
which
the
sun
rises
and
would
enter
in
and
rule
the
land
and
from
that
day
with
a
fidelity
befitting
hebrews
waiting
for
the
coming
of
messiah
the
mexican
people
watched
for
the
fulfillment
of

prophecy

promised
them
a
gentle
rule

from

sacrifices

truly

it
to
find
that
the
mexicans
who
seemed
to
have
been
unacquainted
with
the
doctrine
of

migration

should
have

supreme
god

in

plate

god
is
represented
painted
in
the
attitude
of
a
person
crucified
with
the
impression
of
nails
in
his
hands
and
feet
but
not
actually
upon

the
plate
of
the
borgian
is
the
most
remarkable
of
all
for
there
quetzalcoatl
is
not
only
represented
as
crucified
upon
a
cross
of
greek
form
but
his
burial
and
descent
into
hell
are
also
depicted
in
a
very
curious
manner
the
mexicans
believe
that
quetzalcoatl
took
human
nature
upon
him
partaking
of
all
the
infirmities
of
man
and
was
not
exempt
from
sorrow
pain
or
death
which
he
suffered
voluntarily

atone

the
sins

christ
and
the
story

quetzalcoatl

of
the
savior
so
closely
indeed
that
we
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
that
quetzalcoatl
and
christ
are
the

being

the
history
of

been
handed

the
only
instance
of
the
kind
mentioned
in

new
testament
may
be
taken
as
a
proof
that
it
was
clearly
the
understanding
of
the
apostles
that
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
was
to
be
perpetuated
it
was
so
understood
in
the
church
on
the
western
hemisphere
for
the
fourth
nephi
informs
us
that
as
the
apostles
whom
jesus
had
chosen
passed
away
others
were
ordained
in
their
stead
and
thus
the
quorum
was
kept
full
but
for
how
long
can
not
be
ascertained
the
holy
ghost
the
first
time
the
gospel
was
preached
publicly
after
the
ascension
of
messiah
was
on
the
day
of
pentecost
most
probably
seven
days
after
the
ascension
the
church
had
assembled
and
suddenly
the
promised
baptism
of
the
holy
ghost
promised
both
by
john
the
baptist
and
messiah
took
place
for
the
spirit
came
like
the
rushing
of
a
mighty
wind
and
filled
the
house
where
the
saints
were
assembled
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
it
rested
upon
them
visibly
like
cloven
tongues
of
fire
and
they
began
speaking
in
other
tongues
that
is
in
languages
before
unknown
to
them
as
the
spirit
gave
them
utterance
the
occurrence
was
soon
noised
about
the
city
and
the
multitude
came
together
to
witness
this
strange
event
in
that
great
concourse
of
people
thus
hastily
assembled
were
devout
men
out
of
every
nation
under
heaven
see
note
end

and
they
were
confounded
with
astonishment
since
every
man
heard
the
gospel
in
his
own
language

not
all
these
which
speak
galileans
said
they
and
how
hear
we
every
man
in

tongue
wherein
we
were
born
all
were
amazed
and
some
inquired
one
of
another
what
meaneth
this
others
mockingly
said
these
men
are
full
of
new
wine
to
this
latter
remark
the
apostle
peter
replied
that
the
brethren
were
not
drunken
as
had
been
supposed
and
reminded
the
accusers
that
it
was
but
the
third
hour
of
the
day
men
were
not
likely
to
be
drunk
so
early
the
apostle
further
informed
them
that
his
power
which
they
witnessed
was
the
same
as
that
of
which
joel
spoke
when
he
said
that
in
the
last
days
the
spirit
of
god
should
be
poured
out
upon
all
flesh

having
corrected
the
slander
uttered
by
those
inclined
to
mock
at
the
power
of
god
peter
continued
his
discourse
and
proved
from
the
scriptures
and
from
the
marvelous
works
of
the
lord
jesus
while
among
them
that
he
was
both
lord
and
christ
then
a
great
multitude
was
converted
and
cried
as
with
one
voice
men
and
brethren
what
shall
we
do
to
which
peter
answered
repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
he
informed
them
that
this
promise
of
the
holy
ghost
and
of
course
of
salvation
was
both
to
them
and
to
their
children
in
fact
to
all
whom
god
should
call
there
were
added
to
the
church
that
day
three
thousand
souls
the
rise
of
being
now
endowed
with
power
from
on
high
the
apostles
continued
to
preach
in
and
about
jerusalem
with
great
success
the
lord
working
with
them
and
confirming
their
ministry
by
signs
and
wonders
following
the
believers
the
chief
priests
and
rulers
among
the
jews
became
alarmed
at
the
boldness
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
and
the
rapidity
with
which
faith
in
the
gospel
spread
among
the
people
they
were
in
imminent
danger
of
being
adjudged
by
the
people
guilty
of
executing
an
innocent
man
nay
more
of
putting
to
death
messiah
they
therefore
had
some
of
the
apostles
brought
before
them
and
sought
to
intimidate
them
with
threats
not
to
preach
any
more
in
the
name
of
jesus
to
these
threats
the
apostles
made
answer
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
god
judge
ye
leaving
the
presence
of
the
council
the
apostles
preached
even
more
boldly
in
the
name
of
jesus
a
second
time
they
were
brought
before
the
chief
rulers
to
answer
for
a
disregard
of
the
orders
of
the
council
which
charged
them
with
threats
not
to
teach
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
behold
said
they
ye
have
filled
jerusalem
with
your
doctrine
and
mean
to
bring
this
man
blood
upon
us
the
answer
of
peter
who
spoke
also
for
the
rest
of
the
apostles
was
even
bolder
than
before
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
said
he
the
god
of
our
fathers
raised
up
jesus
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree
him
hath
god
exalted
with
his
right
hand
to
be
a
prince
and
a
savior
for
to
give
repentance
to
israel
and
forgiveness
of
sins
and
we
are
witnesses
of
these
things
and
so
is
also
the
holy
ghost
whom
god
hath
given
to
them
that
obey
him
the
boldness
of
his
answer
gave
deep
offense
and
led
the
chief
rulers
to
take
counsel
how
they
might
slay
them
but
gamaliel
a
learned
doctor
of
the
law
advised
them
against
such
proceedings
his
advice
was
to
let
the
men
alone
for
if
the
work
they
had
in
hand
was
of
men
it
would
come
to
naught
if
it
was
of
god
nothing
which
they
could
do
would
overthrow
it
and
they
might
be
found
fighting
against
god
the
counsel
of
gamaliel
prevailed
in
part
at
least
the
apostles
were
not
killed
at
that
time
but
they
were
once
more
forbidden
to
speak
in
the
name
of
jesus
beaten
and
then
set
free
the
apostles
rejoiced
at
being
found
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
the
name
of
jesus
and
not
heeding
the
orders
of
the
council
continued
preaching
in
the
temple
and
in
private
houses
temporal
so
completely
did
the
apostles
and
the
other
disciples
give
themselves
to
the
work
of
the
ministry
that
complaint
was
made
by
the
grecians
because
the
widows
and
poor
were
neglected
whereupon
the
twelve
called
the
church
together
and
proposed
that
seven
men
of
good
report
be
chosen
and
set
apart
to
see
to
these
affairs
that
they
themselves
might
give
their
attention
wholly
to
the
ministry
as
it
was
not
profitable
for
them
to
neglect
that
in
order
to
wait
on
tables
the
plan
pleased
the
church
and
the
seven
men
were
appointed
all
things
in
the
effect
of
the
gospel
upon
the
saints
of
jerusalem
was
very
marked
they
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
mind
they
had
all
things
in
common
and
those
who
possessed
houses
or
lands
sold
them
and
brought
the
price
of
the
things
and
laid
it
at
the
apostles
feet
distribution
was
made
unto
every
man
as
he
had
need
and
there
was
none
among
them
that
lacked
for
that
which
was
necessary
a
great
persecution
arose
against
the
church
at
jerusalem
within
the
first
year
after
messiah
ascension
so
that
most
of
the
brethren
except
the
apostles
were
scattered
abroad
throughout
judea
and
samaria
everywhere
they
went
they
preached
the
gospel
so
that
great
good
came
out
of
what
was
intended
to
be
an
evil

the
gospel
was
more
widely
preached

one
of
the
seven
who
had
been
appointed
to
look
after
the
temporal
affairs
of
the
church
was
among
the
number
driven
from
jerusalem
by
the
persecution
he
went
to
the
city
of
samaria
where
the
people
listened
to
his
teachings
accepted
his
testimony
and
were
baptized
both
men
and
women
the
apostles
hearing
of
his
success
sent
to
samaria
peter
and
john
and
when
they
came
they
laid
their
hands
upon
those
who
had
been
baptized
and
they
received
the
holy
ghost
and
thus
the
work
was
established
there
it
was
during
this
persecution
that
saul
of
tarsus
afterwards
better
known
as
paul
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
manifested
his
bitterness
toward
the
saints
he
witnessed
the
stoning
to
death
of
stephen
one
of
the
seven
men
appointed
to
look
after
the
temporal
affairs
of
the
church
at
jerusalem
he
held
the
clothes
of
those
who
killed
him
and
being
exceedingly
vexed
at
what
he
regarded
as
a
superstition
he
followed
the
saints
into
distant
cities
breathing
out
threatenings
and
slaughter
against
them
he
went
to
the
high
priest
and
obtained
letters
of
authority
from
him
to
the
rulers
of
the
synagogue
at
damascus
that
if
he
found
any
of
the
saints
there
he
might
bring
them
bound
to
jerusalem
on
his
way
to
damascus
however
the
lord
jesus
appeared
to
him
and
paul
blinded
by
the
glory
of
the
vision
and
humbled
because
he
found
he
had
been
fighting
against
god
was
led
by
his
companions
into
the
city
where
a
disciple
of
the
name
of
ananias
was
sent
by
the
lord
to
restore
to
paul
his
sight
and
baptize
him
he
was
afterwards
made
an
apostle
and
became
zealous
for
the
truth

never
eaten
anything
that
is
common
or
unclean
what
god
hath
cleansed
said
the
voice
that
spoke
to
him
that
call
not
thou
common
or
unclean
this
was
done
thrice
and
as
he
was
yet
pondering
what
the
vision
could
mean
the
messengers
of
cornelius
were
at
the
gates
enquiring
for
him
and
he
was
commanded
by
the
spirit
to
go
with
them
doubting
nothing
for
god
had
sent
them
peter
was
obedient
to
the
inspired
commandment
and
went
to
the
house
of
cornelius
where
he
found
many
of
the
devout
friends
and
kinsmen
gathered
together
in
anticipation
of
his
coming
cornelius
having
informed
the
apostle
how
he
came
to
send
for
him
peter
exclaimed
of
a
truth
i
perceive
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
but
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
him
and
worketh
righteousness
is
accepted
with
him
he
then
proceeded
to
preach
the
gospel
to
cornelius
and
all
present
as
he
did
so
the
holy
ghost
fell
upon
them
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
jews
who
had
accompanied
peter
for
they
heard
them
speak
in
new
tongues
and
magnify
god
cornelius
and
his
friends
were
baptized
and
thus
the
door
of
the
gospel
was
opened
to
the
gentiles
rapid
growth
of
the
the
knowledge
once
established
in
the
minds
of
the
apostles
that
god
granted
to
the
gentiles
repentance
unto
life
seemed
to
unshackle
those
who
were
to
preach
the
gospel
and
gave
a
broader
meaning
in
their
minds
to
their
commission
to
go
unto
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
unto
every
creature
evidently
before
this
they
did
not
comprehend
it
in
its
fullest
sense
the
apostles
appear
to
have
remained
in
jerusalem
a
number
of
years
twelve
years
tradition

over
the
church
and
directing
the
labors
of
those
preaching
the
gospel
churches
or
more
correctly
speaking
branches
of
the
church
were
built
up
in
antioch
damascus
and
other
cities
of
syria
the
work
also
spread
into
asia
minor
greece
and
rome
and
everywhere
great
success
attended
the
preaching
of
the
elders
until
the
gospel
was
firmly
established
in
various
parts
of
the
gentile
world
so
extensive
was
the
preaching
of
the
ambassadors
of
christ
in
those
early
days
of
the
church
that
we
have
paul
saying
about
thirty
years
after
the
ascension
of
messiah
that
it
had
been
preached
to
every
creature
under

see
note
end
of
section
notes
was
matthias
called
of
god
in
consequence
of
matthias
having
been
chosen
by
lot
it
may
be
a
question
in
the
minds
of
some
as
to
his
being
called
of
god
a
careful
consideration
of
all
that
was
done
in
connection
with
that
circumstance
will
dispel
all
doubt
in
relation
to
it
it
must
be
observed
that
after
joseph
barsabas
and
matthias
were
nominated
for
the
place
in
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
the
apostles
prayed
saying
thou
lord
which
knowest
the
hearts
of
all
men
show
whether
of
these
two
thou
hast
chosen
before
his
ascension
jesus
had
said
to
these
men
if
ye
abide
in
me
and
my
words
abide
in
you
ye
shall
ask
what
ye
will
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
you
ye
have
not
chosen
me
but
i
have
chosen
you
and
ordained
you
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
of
the
father
in
my
name
he
may
give
it
you
therefore
when
these
apostles
asked
which
of
the
two
men
nominated
god
had
chosen
and
they
gave
their
votes
and
matthias
was
the
one
selected
god
in
that
way
answered
their
prayer
and
matthias
was
thus
called
of
god
again
to
be
called
by
a
divinely
appointed
authority
is
to
be
called
of
god
no
one
can
deny
that
the
apostles
were
a
divinely
appointed
authority
hence
to
be
called
by
them
was
to
be
called
of
roberts
pentecost
is
the
name
given
in
the
new
testament
to
the
feast
of
weeks
or
of
ingathering
celebrated
on
the
fiftieth
day
from
the
passover
it
was
a
festival
of
thanks
for
the
harvest
it
was
also
one
of
the
three
great
yearly
festivals
in
which
all
the
males
were
required
to
appear
before
the
lord
at
the
place
of
his
sanctuary
josephus
in
three
places
in
his
writings
in
the
fourteenth
book
of
antiquities
ch
ibid
xvii
ch
and
in
his
second
book
of
the
wars
of
the
jews
ch
speaks
of
this
festival
as
bringing
together
great
numbers
of
the
jews
from
all
parts
of
the
world
and
sustains
the
statement
in
acts
ii
that
there
were
in
jerusalem
at
pentecost
jews
devout
men
out
of
every
nation
under
heaven
who
came
running
together
on
hearing
that
the
disciples
of
jesus
were
speaking
in
unknown
tongues
we
can
not
refrain
from
remarking
that
it
was
a
most
opportune
time
for
such
a
demonstration
since
these
men
would
carry
the
rumor
of
these
things
and
the
substance
of
the
remarkable
sermon
they
heard
to
the
distant
lands
from
which
they
had
come
and
thus
the
news
of
the
gospel
would
be
spread
roberts
joel
it
is
very
generally
supposed
among
christians
that
this
outpouring
of
the
holy
ghost
on
the
day
of
pentecost
was
the
fulfillment
of
joel
prophecy
that
is
its
complete
fulfillment
a
careful
examination
of
the
prophecy
however
will
clearly
demonstrate
that
this
is
not
the
case
the
prophecy
will
be
found
in
joel
and
the
particulars
enumerated
in
it
are
as
follows
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
to
be
poured
out
upon
all
flesh
at
pentecost
it
was
poured
out
upon
a
few
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
only
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
people
were
to
prophesy
we
have
no
account
of
their
doing
so
at
pentecost
old
men
were
to
dream
dreams
and
young
men
see
visions
there
is
no
account
of
this
taking
place
on
the
occasion
in
question
wonders
were
to
be
shown
in
the
heavens
and
in
the
earth
blood
and
fire
and
pillars
of
smoke
the
sun
is
to
be
turned
into
darkness
the
moon
into
blood
before
the
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
lord
come
yet
on
mount
zion
and
in
jerusalem
deliverance
was
to
be
found
these
things
unquestionably
point
to
the
glorious
coming
of
the
son
of
god
to
judgment
see
matt
xxiv
and
certainly
they
were
not
fulfilled
on
the
day
of
pentecost
by
the
outpouring
of
the
holy
ghost
on
a
few
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
still
peter
said
referring
to
the
spirit
poured
out
upon
the
disciples
this
is
that
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
joel
and
then
quoted
the
passage
he
doubtless
meant
this
spirit
which
you
now
see
poured
out
upon
these
few
men
is
that
spirit
which
joel
spoke
of
and
which
will
eventually
be
poured
out
upon
all
flesh
not
only
upon
men
and
women
but
upon
the
brute
creation
as
well
so
that
the
lion
and
lamb
shall
lie
down
together
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
and
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
god
holy
mountain
i
have
deemed
it
necessary
to
make
this
note
first
because
of
the
very
general
belief
among
christians
that
the
prophecy
of
joel
was
fulfilled
on
the
day
of
pentecost
and
second
because
the
prophecy
is
one
that
was
quoted
by
the
angel
moroni
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
joseph
smith
concerning
which
he
said
it
was
not
yet
fulfilled
but
soon
would
be
pearl
of
great
price
page
hence
since
this
heavenly
messenger
puts
its
fulfillment
in
the
future
it
could
not
have
been
fulfilled
on
the
day

pentecost

penetrating

round

a

when

then
it
almost
resembled

of

paul
was
small
in
size
and
his
personal
appearance
did
not
correspond
with
the
greatness
of
his
soul
he
was
ugly
stout
short
and
stooping
and
his
broad
shoulders
awkwardly
sustained
a
little
bald
head
his
sallow
countenance
was
half
hidden
in
a
thick
beard
his
nose
was
aquiline
his
eyes
piercing
and
his
heavy
and
joined
across
his
forehead
nor
was
there
anything
imposing
in
his
speech
for
his
timid
and
embarrassed
air
gave
but
a
poor
idea
of
his
eloquence
he
shrewdly
however
admitted
his
exterior
defects
and
even
drew
advantage
therefrom
the
jewish
race
possesses
the
peculiarity
of
at
the
same
time
presenting
types
of
the
greatest
beauty
and
the
most
thorough
ugliness
but
this
jewish
ugliness
is
something
quite
apart
by
itself

of

of

the

of

on
leaving
jerusalem
traveled
over
a
great
part
of
the
world
and
in
a
short
time
collected
numerous
religious
societies
in
various
countries
of
the
churches
they
founded
not
a
small
number
is
mentioned
in
the
sacred
books
especially
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
besides
these
there
can
be
no
doubt
they
collected
many
others
both
by
their
own
efforts
and
by
the
efforts
of
their
followers
but
how
far
they
traveled
what
nations
they
visited
or
when
and
where
they
died
is
exceedingly
dubious

they
too
jews
that
is
persons
odious
to

nations
in
so
short
a
time
to
persuade
a
great
part
of
mankind
to
abandon
the
religion
of
their
fathers
and
to
embrace
a
new
religion
which
is
opposed
to
the
natural
dispositions
of
men
in
the
words
they
uttered
there
must
have
been
an
amazing
and
a
divine
power

the
minds
of

which
may
be
added
miracles

the

secret

magnanimity

contempt

worse
than
death
as
well
as
of

itself

finally

the
purest
and
most
unblemished
character
that
the
ambassadors
of
jesus
christ
were
in
fact
thus
furnished
for
their
work
is
a
truth
perfectly
clear
and
obvious
and
if
we
suppose
them
not
to
have
been
so
furnished
no

can
be

by

may
now
review
the
doctrines
that
he
taught
which
taken
in
the
aggregate
constitute
the
gospel
and
examine
the
character
of
the
organization
he
founded
the
church
the
mission
of
jesus
christ
came
into
the
earth
to
accomplish
three
great
purposes
first
to
redeem
mankind
from
the
consequences
of
adam
transgression
second
to
save
them
from
the
consequences
of
their
own
sins
the
first
is
a
general
salvation
which
without
any
conditions
whatever
will
be
applied
to
all
mankind
irrespective
of
their
obedience
or
disobedience
to
god
their
righteousness
or
wickedness
their
belief
or
unbelief
the
redemption
will
be
as
universal
as
the
fall
the
second
may
be
regarded
as
a
particular
salvation
dependent
upon
faith
in
and
obedience
to
the
gospel
of
christ
by
the
individual
the
when
adam
and
eve
were
placed
in
the
garden
of
eden
there
were
certain
laws
given
them
by
their
creator
the
penalty
of
violating
which
was
death
and
banishment
from
the
presence
of
god
they
transgressed
the
laws
and
became
subject
to
the
penalty
nor
was
that
all
but
by
their
transgression
having
become
mortal
they
bequeathed
that
mortality
to
their
offspring
and
thus
death
passed
upon
all
mankind
and
that
too
through
no
act
or
fault
of
theirs
their
agency
was
not
exercised
in
the
matter
and
therefore
justice
would
require
that
they
should
receive
a
full
and
complete
redemption
from
the
evil
which
overtakes
them
through
the
actions
of
others
over
which
they
had
no
control
general
such
a
redemption
was
wrought
out
through
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
and
that
its
benefits
are
to
be
universal
so
far
as
redeeming
mankind
for
the
consequences
of
transgression
is
concerned
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
is
universal
as
the
scriptures
witness
and
many
of
them
that
sleep
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
shall
awake
some
to
everlasting
life
and
some
to
shame
and
everlasting
contempt
for
as
the
father
hath
life
in
himself
so
hath
he
given
to
the
son
to
have
life
in
himself
marvel
not
at
this
for
the
hour
is
coming
in
which
all
that
are
in
their
graves
shall
hear
his
voice
and
shall
come
forth
they
that
have
done
good
unto
the
resurrection
of
life
and
they
that
have
done
evil
unto
the
resurrection
of
damnation
or
as
the
last
two
clauses
were
given
to
the
prophet
joseph
smith
by
inspiration
they
who
have
done
good
in
the
resurrection
of
the
just
and
they
who
have
done
evil
in
the
resurrection
of
the
unjust
after
giving
a
full
account
of
the
resurrection
of
the
righteous
and
their
reign
upon
the
earth
for
a
thousand
years
the
writer
of
the
apocalypse
says
and
i
saw
the
dead
small
and
great
stand
before
god
and
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
it
and
death
and
hell
delivered
up
the
dead
which
were
in
them
and
they
were
judged
every
man
according
to
his
works
the
scriptures
plainly
declare
that
the
redemption
of
men
from
the
consequences
of
adam
transgression
shall
be
universal
therefore
as
by
the
offense
of
one
adam
judgment
came
upon
to
condemnation
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
free
gift
came
all
to
the
justification
of
life
since
by
man
came
death
by
man
came
also
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
for
as
in
adam
even
so
in
christ
shall
be
made
but
every
man
in
his
own
order
christ
the
first
fruits
afterward
they
that
are
christ
at
his
coming
then
cometh
the
end
when
he
shall
have
delivered
the
kingdom
to
god
even
the
father
when
he
shall
have
put
down
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
power
for
he
must
reign
till
he
hath
put
all
enemies
under
his
feet
the
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
behold
he
created
adam
and
by
adam
came
the
fall
of
man
and
because
of
the
fall
of
man
came
jesus
christ
even
the
father
and
the
son
and
because
of
jesus
christ
came
the
redemption
of
man
and
because
of
the
redemption
of
man
which
came
by
jesus
christ
they
are
brought
back
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
yea
this
is
wherein
all
men
are
redeemed
because
the
death
of
christ
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
which
bringeth
to
pass
a
redemption
from
an
endless
sleep
from
which
sleep
all
men
shall
be
awakened
by
the
power
of
god
when
the
trump
shall
sound
and
they
shall
come
forth
both
small
and
great
and
all
shall
stand
before
his
bar
being
redeemed
and
loosed
from
this
eternal
band
of
death
which
death
is
a
temporal
death
through
the
atonement
made
by
messiah
therefore
a
full
and
complete
redemption
from
the
consequences
of
adam
transgression
is
brought
about
that
is
a
victory
over
the
grave
is
secured
and
that
too
through
the
merits
of
jesus
christ
and
while
the
law
transgressed
by
adam
has
been
vindicated
the
posterity
of
adam
who
became
subject
to
death
through
his
disobedience
are
redeemed
from
the
grave
without
anything
being
required
of
them
for
as
their
agency
was
not
concerned
in
bringing
about
the
mischief
nothing
is
required
of
them
in

to
obtain
redemption

the
atonement
a
fact
proven
by
it
is
often
asked
how
is
it
that
through
the
sacrifice
of
one
who
is
innocent
salvation
may
be
purchased
for
those
under
the
dominion
of
death
we
observe
in
passing
that
what
should
most
concern
man
is
not
so
much
it
is
that
such
is
the
case
but
is
it
a
is
it
true
that
god
has
established
such
a
scheme
of
redemption
is
what
should
concern
him
to
that
question
the
blood
sprinkled
upon
a
thousand
jewish
altars
and
the
smoke
that
darkened
the
heavens
for
ages
from
burnt
offerings
answer
yes
for
those
sacrifices
and
that
sprinkled
blood
were
but
typical
of
the
great
sacrifice
to
be
made
by
the
messiah
even
the
mythology
of
heathen
nations
retains
the
idea
of
an
atonement
that
either
has
been
or
is
to
be
made
for
mankind
fantastic
distorted
confused
buried
under
the
rubbish
of
savage
superstition
it
may
be
but
it
nevertheless
exists
so
easily
traced
so
distinct
is
this
feature
of
heathen
mythology
that
some
writers
have
endeavored
to
prove
that
the
gospel
plan
of
redemption
was
derived
from
heathen
mythology
whereas
the
fact
is
that
the
gospel
was
understood
and
extensively
preached
in
the
earliest
ages
men
retained
in
their
tradition
a
knowledge
of
those
principles
or
parts
of
them
and
however
much
they
may
have
been
distorted
traces
of
them
may
still
be
found
in
nearly
all
the
mythologies
of
the
world
the
prophets
of
the
jewish
scriptures
answer
the
question
in
the
affirmative
the
writers
of
the
new
testament
make
christ
atonement
the
principal
theme
of
their
discourses
and
epistles
the
book
of
mormon
speaking
as
the
voice
of
entire
nations
of
people
whose
prophets
and
righteous
men
sought
and
found
god
testify
to
the
same
great
fact
the
revelations
of
god
as
given
through
the
prophet
joseph
smith
are
replete
with
passages
confirming
this
doctrine
the
evidence
is
more
than
sufficient
to
establish
the
of
the
atonement
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
and
if
there
are
some
things
in
it
not
within
the
scope
of
our
comprehension
still
there
is
sufficient
foundation
for
the
glorious
hope
of
eternal
life
through
its
power
claims
of
mercy
and
justice
in
the
atonement
there
is
a
nice
balancing
of
the
relative
claims
of
justice
and
mercy
the
law
given
to
man
having
been
transgressed
justice
demanded
the
payment
of
the
penalty
which
was
death
and
as
adam
had
no
power
to
liberate
himself
from
the
captivity
thereof
his
sleep
in
the
grave
must
have
been
eternal
so
also
with
all
his
posterity
to
whom
his
mortality
was
bequeathed
as
an
evil
legacy
had
not
mercy
put
in
her
claims
and
prevented
justice
from
being
cruel
the
son
of
god
having
it
given
to
him
to
have
life
in
himself
and
being
capable
of
making
an
infinite
atonement
he
stood
forth
as
the
great
friend
of
man
and
offered
himself
as
a
sacrifice
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
justice
that
offering
was
accepted
by
the
great
law
giver
and
upon
the
demands
of
justice
being
satisfied
the
law
having
no
further
claim
upon
him
the
captive
is
set
free
from
the
dominion
of
death
mercy
is
not
permitted
to
rob
justice
but
she
claims
her
own
justice
is
not
permitted
to
be
cruel
but
he
retains
his
dignity
his
demands
are
satisfied
as
the
late
president
taylor
very
beautifully
says
is
justice
dishonored
no
it
is
satisfied
the
debt
is
paid
is
righteousness
departed
from
no
there
is
a
righteous
act
all
requirements
are
met
is
judgment
violated
no
its
demands
are
fulfilled
is
mercy
triumphant
no
she
simply
claims
her
own
justice
judgment
mercy
and
truth
all
harmonize
as
the
attributes
of
deity
justice
and
truth
have
met
together
righteousness
and
peace
have
kissed
each
other
justice
and
judgment
triumph
as
well
as
mercy
and
peace
all
the
attributes
of
deity
harmonize
in
this
great
momentous
just
equitable
merciful
and
meritorious
act
the
sacrifice
of
messiah
unbelievers
delight
to
represent
god
the
great
law
giver
as
unspeakably
cruel
in
demanding
such
an
atonement
as
christ
made
for
the
salvation
of
the
children
of
men
but
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
he
who
made
the
atonement
did
so
voluntarily
testifying
to
his
disciples
respecting
the
matter
he
says
therefore
doth
my
father
love
me
be
cause
i
lay
down
my
life
that
i
may
take
it
up
again
no
man
taketh
it
from
me
but
i
lay
it
down
of
myself
i
have
power
to
lay
it
down
and
i
have
power
to
take
it
again
this
commandment
have
i
received
of
my
father
when
his
enemies
gathered
about
him
a
former
friend
betraying
him
with
a
kiss
and
peter
prepared
to
defend
him
with
the
sword
he
chided
him
for
his
rashness
commanding
him
to
put
up
his
sword
and
added
thinkest
thou
that
i
can
not
now
pray
to
my
father
and
he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
but
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled
that
thus
it
must
be
thus
down
to
the
very
last
moment
it
appears
that
jesus
could
have
been
delivered
from
the
sacrifice
had
he
so
willed
it
but
the
principle
which
was
the
guiding
star
of
his
life
father
not
my
will
but
thy
will
be
done
influenced
him
in
this
instance
and
he
drank
of
the
cup
given
him
of
his
father
and
wrung
out
the
dregs
in
agony
but
he
did
it
voluntarily
and
that
too
out
of
his
great
love
for
mankind
the
love
of
god
made
manifest
in
the
by
this
atonement
of
messiah
there
is
especially
one
fact
thrown
out
in
bold
relief
that
is
the
great
love
of
god
and
christ
for
mankind
when
one
thinks
of
the
unspeakable
agony
of
the
anguish
of
heart
of
the
pains
that
racked
the
body
and
distressed
the
mind
of
the
savior
at
the
time
of
his
betrayal
and
during
his
trial
and
crucifixion
he
may
see
how
great
the
love
of
the
father
for
mankind
must
be
when
he
would
consent
for
his
only
begotten
son
to
pass
through
this
great
humiliation
and
affliction
in
order
to
redeem
mankind
from
the
bonds
of
death
on
such
contemplation
increased
emphasis
will
be
given
to
the
passage
in
this
was
manifested
the
love
of
god
towards
us
because
that
god
sent
his
only
begotten
son
into
the
world
that
we
might
live
through
him
and
also
to
this
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
for
god
sent
not
his
son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
world
but
that
the
world
through
him
might
be
saved
equally
great
appears
the
love
of
the
son
of
god
who
of
his
own
free
will
volunteered
to
take
upon
himself
the
task
of
man
redemption
individual
as
before
stated
messiah
came
not
only
to
redeem
man
from
the
consequences
of
the
fall
but
to
save
him
also
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
personal
sins
the
redemption
from
the
fall
is
universal
and
unconditional
because
the
penalties
following
it
were
entailed
upon
the
race
through
no
action
of
theirs
but
through
the
transgressions
of
adam
the
redemption
from
the
consequences
of
man
personal
sins
however
is
bottomed
upon
conditions
because
his
agency
is
more
completely
a
factor
in
the
violations
of
the
law
he
sins
knowingly
willfully
and
sometimes
wantonly
he
transgresses
the
laws
of
god
and
of
nature
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
his
conscience
the
convictions
of
his
reason
and
the
promptings
of
his
judgment
he
becomes
desperately
wicked
and
so
depraved
that
in
some
cases
he
actually
seeks
evil
and
loves
it
he
hugs
it
to
his
bosom
and
cries
evil
be
thou
my
good
sin
be
thou
my
refuge
in
cases
of
such
violation
of
the
laws
of
god
justice
demands
that
the
outraged
laws
should
be
vindicated
by
the
punishment
of
the
transgressor
but
here
again
the
principle
of
mercy
is
active
by
the
sacrifice
which
he
made
messiah
purchased
mankind
as
an
inheritance
for
himself
and
they
came
of
right
under
his
dominion
for
he
not
only
ransomed
them
from
an
endless
sleep
in
the
grave
but
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
by
his
stripes
we
are
healed
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
see
note
end
of
section
it
was
these
considerations
doubtless
which
led
the
apostle
to
say
to
the
saints
ye
are
not
your
own
for
ye
are
bought
with
a
price
still
more
plain
in
relation
to
the
effect
that
messiah
atonement
has
upon
the
personal
sins
of
men
is
the
word
of
the
lord
through
the
prophet
joseph
smith
to
martin
harris
warning
him
to
repent
lest
his
sufferings
be
sore
how
sore
how
exquisite
how
hard
to
bear
he
knew
not
for
behold
i
god
have
suffered
these
things
for
all
that
they
might
not
suffer
if
they
would
repent
but
if
they
would
not
repent
they
must
suffer
even
as
i
which
suffering
caused
myself
even
god

greatest
of
all
to
tremble
because
of
pain

to
bleed
at

benefits
of

atonement
shall

these
conditions

saying
all

therefore

one

remission
of
sins
and
promised
them
on
the
condition

their
obedience
the

ghost
by
repentance
they
meant
a
deep
and
sorrow

messiah
during
his
personal
ministry
organized
a
quorum

twelve
apostles
to
whom
he
gave
very
great
powers
and
authority
even
to
be
witnesses
of
him
among
the
people
to
build
up
his
church
by
the
proclamation
of
the
gospel
to
heal
the
sick
open
the
eyes
of
the
blind
raise
the
dead
and
cast
out

he
likewise
organized
quorums
of

whom
he
gave
similar
powers

bestowed
upon
the
apostles
after
his
resurrection
messiah
was
with
his
apostles
and
disciples
forty
days
during
which
time
he
was
teaching
them
all
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god
hence
we
have
these
men
after
his
ascension
organizing
branches
of
the
church
wherever
they
found
people
who
received
their
testimony
in

instances
they
ordained

a
description
of
the
organization
of
the
church
says
and
god
hath
set
some
in
the
church
first
apostles
secondarily
prophets
thirdly
teachers
after
that
miracles
then
gifts
of
healing
helps
governments
diversities
of
tongues
are
all
apostles
are
all
prophets
are
all
teachers
are
all
workers
of
miracles
have
all
the
gifts
of
healing
do
all
speak
with
tongues
do
all
interpret
the
implied
answer
is
that
all
are
not
apostles
nor
prophets
nor
teachers
in
the
church
of
christ
but
that
the
whole
body
is
fitly
joined
together
and
compacted
by
that
which
every
part
and
every
joint
supplieth
preceding
the
first
quotation
we
made
from
paul
he
compares
the
church
of
christ
to
the
body
of
a
man
which
though
it
be
composed
of
many
members
yet
it
is
but
one
body
and
all
the
members
thereof
are
needful
to
it
the
eye
can
not
say
unto
the
hand
i
have
no
need
of
thee
nor
again
the
head
to
the
feet
i
have
no
need
of
thee
nay
much
more
those
members
of
the
body
which
seem
to
be
more
feeble
are
necessary
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
apostle
can
not
say
to
the
elder
i
have
no
need
of
thee
nor
the
deacon
to
the
bishop
i
have
no
need
of
thee
nor
the
seventy
to
the
priest
i
have
no
need
of
thee
the
argument
is
that
all
the
offices
even
those
which
seem
the
least
necessary
are
all
needful
to
the
existence
of
the
church
of
christ
and
everyone
is
forbidden
to
hold
as
unnecessary
his
brother
officer
moreover
the
apostle
insists
that
there
should
be
the
same
bond
of
sympathy
between
the
members
of
the
church
of
christ
that
there
is
in
the
members
of
the
human
body
that
there
should
be
no
schism
in
it
and
that
the
members
should
have
a
care
one
for
another
that
when
one
member
suffers
all
the
members
suffer
with
it
or
if
one
member
be
honored
all
rejoice
with
it
in
another
description
of
the
church
the
same
writer
after
saying
again
that
god
had
given
to
men
some
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
he
also
enumerates
the
objects
for
which
this
peculiar
organization
was
given
for
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
the
work
of
the
ministry
edifying
the
body
of
christ
to
prevent
the
saints
being
carried
about
by
every
wind
of
doctrine
by
the
sleight
of
men
and
cunning
craftiness
whereby
they
lie
in
wait
to
deceive
he
very
plainly
intimates
too
that
this
organization
was
designed
to
be
perpetuated
until
the
saints
all
come
to
the
unity
of
the
faith
and
the
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
unto
a
perfect
man
unto
the
measure
of
the
stature
of
the
fullness
of
christ
furthermore
we
suggest
that
it
must
be
obvious
since
the
church
organization
was
given
to
perfect
the
saints
to
the
work
of
the
ministry
to
edify
the
body
of
christ
to
prevent
the
saints
being
carried
about
by
every
wind
of
doctrine
or
being
deceived
by
cunning
men
that
so
long
as
there
are
saints
who
need
perfecting
so
long
as
there
is
a
necessity
for
work
in
the
ministry
so
long
as
the
church
of
christ
needs
edifying
or
the
saints
need
to
be
guarded
from
heresy
or
the
deceitfulness
of
false
teachers
just
so
long
will
this
organization
of
the
church
with
apostles
and
prophets
seventies
and
elders
bishops
and
teachers
and
deacons
be
needed
and
since
the
kinds
of
work
enumerated
in
the
foregoing
will
always
be
necessary
we
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
church
organization
as
established
by
the
apostles
was
designed
to
be
perpetual
see

officers
of
the
church
to
be
divinely
moreover
it
is
apparent
that
these
officers
of
the
church
were
called
of
god
concerning
the
apostles
jesus
said
ye
have
not
chosen
me
but
i
have
chosen
you
and
ordained
you
that
ye
may
bring
forth
fruit
when
seven
men
were
chosen
to
look
after
the
poor
and
minister
to
them
they
set
them
before
the
apostles
who
when
they
had
prayed
laid
their
hands
upon
them
and
ordained
them
to
their
calling
so
in
the
case
of
paul
it
was
not
enough
that
he
saw
and
spoke
with
messiah
for
afterwards
when
the
lord
would
have
him
engage
in
the
work
of
preaching
the
gospel
and
administering
in
the
ordinances
thereof
the
holy
ghost
said
unto
certain
prophets
at
antioch
separate
me
barnabas
and
saul
for
the
work
whereunto
i
have
called
them
and
when
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
and
laid
their
hands
on
them
they
sent
them
away
furthermore
as
paul
went
about
confirming
the
souls
of
saints
he
ordained
elders
in
every
church
he
did
not
suffer
men
to
take
the
authority
on
themselves
to
minister
in
the
things
of
god
but
warned
the
saints
against
such
characters
take
heed
unto
yourselves
said
he
to
the
elders
of
ephesus
and
to
all
the
flock
over
which
the
holy
ghost
hath
made
you
overseers
to
feed
the
flock
of
god
for
i
know
this
that
after
my
departing
shall
grievous
wolves
enter
in
not
sparing
the
flock
and
of
your
own
selves
shall
men
arise
speaking
perverse
things
to
draw
away
disciples
after
them
the
general
law
of
the
church
is
expressed
in
the
following
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
ordained
for
men
in
things
pertaining
to
god
that
he
may
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
sins
and
no
man
taketh
this
honor
unto
himself
but
he
that
is
called
of
god
as
was
aaron
the
manner
in
which
aaron
was
called
to
the
priest
office
is
recorded
in
the
writings
of
moses
as
follows
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
that
prophet
saying
take
thou
unto
thee
aaron
thy
brother
and
his
sons
with
him
from
among
the
children
of
israel
that
he
may
minister
unto
me
in
the
priest
office
even
aaron
nadab
and
abihu
eleazer
and
ithamar
aaron
sons
it
may
be
objected
that
this
was
the
law
relating
to
the
calling
of
high
priests
alone
but
if
high
priests
were
to
be
called
in
this
manner
is
it
not
reasonable
to
conclude
that
all
who
administer
in
things
pertaining
to
god
must
be
called
in
the
same
manner
that
is
of
god
so
far
as
the
scriptures
are
concerned
and
on
subjects
of
this
character
their
authority
is
conclusive
wherever
we
have
an
account
of
men
administering
in
the
things
pertaining
to
god
and
their
administrations
are
accepted
of
him
they
have
either
been
called
directly
by
revelation
from
him
or
through
inspiration
in
those
who
already
had
authority
from
god
to
act
in
his
name
and
to
be
called
by
a
legitimate
divinely
established
authority
is
to
be
called
of
god

of
section
the
church
on
the
western
the
book
of
mormon
is
no
more
explicit
in
its
description
of
the
church
organization
than
the
new
testament
this
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
book
of
mormon
is
but
an
abridgement
of
the
nephite
annals
and
we
are
informed
by
mormon
who
made
the
abridgement
that
not
an
hundredth
part
of
the
things
which
jesus
taught
to
the
nephites
could
be
recorded
in
his
abridged
record
hence
the
meagre
description
of
the
church
organization
from
mormon
abridged
account
of
messiah
visit
and
labors
among
the
nephites
however
it
appears
that
jesus
chose
from
among
the
faithful
men
who
believed
on
him
twelve
apostles
unto
whom
he
gave
power
to
preach
repentance
baptize
for
remission
of
sins
lay
on
hands
for
the
holy
ghost
and
organize
the
church
but
the
details
of
this
work
are
not
given
it
is
evident
however
that
the
twelve
disciples
ordained
subordinate
officers
since
moroni
informs
us
of
the
manner
in
which
they
ordained
priests
and
teachers
and
he
also
refers
to
the
office
of
elders
thus
in
the
book
of
mormon
as
in
the
new
testament
may
be
seen
only
the
faint
outlines
of
the
organization
the
church
of
christ
a

description
of
it

with

of

officers
and

of
which
it
is
composed
will
be
reserved
for
part
iv
of
this
work
the
acceptance
of
the
gospel
by
the
nephites
was
followed
by
the
same
results
as
when
accepted
by
the
jews
and
gentiles
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
the
sick
were
healed
the
dead
were
raised
the
lame
walked
the
deaf
heard
and
the
blind
received
their
sight
peace
love
sobriety
justice
and
an
absence
of
greed
and
pride
characterized
the
conduct
of
the
saints
of
the
western
hemisphere
and
here
too
they
had
all
things
common
among
them
therefore
they
were
not
rich
and
poor
bond
and
free
but
they
were
all
made
free
and
partakers
of
the
heavenly
gifts
notes
the
redemption
we
believe
that
through
the
sufferings
death
and
atonement
of
jesus
christ
all
mankind
without
one
exception
are
to
be
completely
and
fully
redeemed
both
body
and
spirit
from
the
endless
banishment
and
curse
to
which
they
were
consigned
by
adam
transgression
and
that
this
universal
salvation
and
redemption
of
the
whole
human
family
from
the
endless
penalty
of
the
original
sin
is
effected
without
any
conditions
whatsoever
on
their
part
that
is
that
they
are
not
required
to
believe
or
repent
or
be
baptized
or
do
anything
else
in
order
to
be
redeemed
from
that
penalty

whether
they
believe
or
disbelieve
whether
they
repent
or
remain
impenitent
whether
they
are
baptized
or
unbaptized
whether
they
keep
the
commandments
or
break
them
whether
they
are
righteous
or
unrighteous
it
will
make
no
difference
in
relation
to
their
redemption
both
soul
and
body
from
the
penalty
of
transgression
the
most
righteous
man
that
ever
lived
on
the
earth
and
the
most
wicked
wretch
of
the
whole
human
family
were
both
placed
under
the
same
curse
without
any
transgression
or
agency
of
their
own
and
they
both
alike
will
be
redeemed
from
that
curse

as

in

jesus
assumed
the
responsibility
which
naturally
would
have
devolved
upon

but
which
could
only
be
accomplished
through

by
taking
upon
himself
their

to

happiness
never
more
to
be
banished
from
the

of
god
if
they
themselves
have
committed
no

we
believe
that
all
mankind
in
consequence
of
the
fall
after
they
grow
up
from
their
infant
state
and
come
to
the
years
of
understanding
know
good
and
evil
and
are
capable
of
obeying
or
disobeying
law
and
that
a
law
is
given
against
doing
evil
and
that
the
penalty
affixed
is
a
second
banishment
from
the
presence
of
god
both
body
and
spirit
after
they
have
been
redeemed
from
the
first
banishment
and
restored
into
his
presence
we
believe
that
all
who
have
done
evil
having
a
knowledge
of
the
law
or
afterwards
in
this
life
coming
to
the
knowledge
thereof
are
under
its
penalty
which
is
not
inflicted
in
this
world
but
in
the
world
to
come
but
inquires
the
sinner
is
there
no
way
of
escape
is
my
case
hopeless
the
answer
is
if
thou
canst
hide
thyself
from
the
eye
of
an
omnipresent
god
that
he
shall
not
find
thee
or
if
thou
canst
prevail
with
him
to
deny
justice
its
claim
or
if
thou
canst
clothe
thyself
with
power
and
contend
with
the
almighty
and
prevent
him
from
executing
the
sentence
of
the
law
then
thou
canst
escape
but
be
assured
o
sinner
that
thou
canst
not
devise
any
way
of
thine
own
to
escape
nor
do
anything
which
will
atone
for
thy
sins
therefore
thy
case
is
hopeless
unless
god
hath
devised
some
way
for
thy
deliverance
but
do
not
let
despair
seize
upon
thee
for
he
who
gave
the
law
has
devised
a
way
for
thy
deliverance
that
same
jesus
who
hath
atoned
for
the
original
sin
transgression
and
will
redeem
all
mankind
from
the
penalty
thereof
hath
also
atoned
for
thy
sins
and
offereth
salvation
and
deliverance
to
thee
on
certain
conditions
to
be
complied
with
on
thy
part
the
first
condition
to
be
complied
with
on
the
part
of
sinners
is
to
believe
in
god
and
in
the
sufferings
and
death
of
his
son
jesus
christ
and
in
the
holy
ghost
that
the
second
condition
is
to
repent
that
the
third
condition
is
to
be
baptized
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
that
the
fourth
condition
is
to
receive
the
laying
on
of
hands
for
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
they
are
then
required
to
be
humble
to
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
to

and

four
opinions
on
church
how
far
even
wise
men
and
christian
scholars
have
gone
astray
in
relation
to
church
government
may
be
judged
from
the
following
opinions
on
the
subject
those
who
imagine
that
christ
himself
or
the
apostles
by
his
direction
or
authority
appointed
a
certain
fixed
form
of
church
government
are
not
agreed
what
that
form
was
the
principal
opinions
that
have
been
adopted
upon
this
head
may
be
reduced
to
the
four
following
is
that
of
the
roman
catholics
maintain
that
intention
and
appointment
was
that
his
followers
should
be
collected
into
one
sacred
empire
subject
to
the
government
of
peter
and
his
successors
and
divided
like
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
into
several
provinces
that
in
consequence
thereof
peter
fixed
the
seat
of
ecclesiastical
dominion
at
rome
but
afterwards
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
his
office
divided
the
church
into
three
greater
provinces
according
to
the
division
of
the
world
at
that
time
and
appointed
a
person
to
preside
in
each
who
was
dignified
with
the
title
of
patriarch
that
the
european
patriarch
resided
at
rome
the
asiatic
at
antioch
and
the
african
at
alexandria
that
the
bishops
of
each
province
among
whom
there
were
various
ranks
were
to
reverence
the
authority
of
their
respective
patriarchs
and
that
both
bishops
and
patriarchs
were
to
be
passively
subject
to
the
supreme
dominion
of
the
roman
pontiff
this
romantic
account
scarcely
deserves
a
serious
refutation
the
opinion
concerning
the
government
of
the
church
makes
no
mention
of
a
supreme
head
or
of
patriarchs
constituted
by
a
divine
authority
but
it
supposes
that
the
apostles
divided
the
roman
empire
into
as
many
ecclesiastical
provinces
as
there
were
secular
or
civil
ones
that
the
metropolitan
bishops
that
is
the
prelate
who
resides
in
the
capital
city
of
each
province
presides
over
the
clergy
of
that
province
and
that
the
other
bishops
were
subject
to
his
authority
this
opinion
has
been
adopted
by
some
of
the
most
learned
of
the
romish
church
and
has
also
been
favored
by
some
of
the
most
eminent
british
divines
some
protestant
writers
of
note
have
endeavored
to
prove
that
it
is
not
supported
by
sufficient
evidence
the
opinion
is
that
of
those
who
acknowledge
that
when
the
christians
began
to
multiply
exceedingly
metropolitans
patriarchs
and
archbishops
were
indeed
created
but
only
by
human
appointment
and
authority
though
they
confess
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
consonant
to
the
orders
and
intentions
of
christ
and
his
apostles
that
there
should
be
in
every
christian
church
one
person
invested
with
the
highest
authority
and
clothed
with
certain
rights
and
privileges
above
the
other
doctors
of
that
assembly
this
opinion
has
been
embraced
by
many
english
divines
of
the
first
rank
in
the
learned
world
and
also
by
many
in
other
countries
and
communions
the
and
last
opinion
is
that
of
the
presbyterians
who
affirm
that
christ
intention
was
that
the
christian
doctors
and
ministers
should
all
enjoy
the
same
rank
and
authority
without
any
sort
of
or
subordination
or
distinction

the
truth
of
the
matter
is
remarks
maclaine
that
christ
by
leaving
this
matter
undetermined
has
of
consequence
left
christian
societies
a
discretionary
power
of
modeling
the
government
of
the
church
in
such
a
manner
as
the
circumstantial
reasons
of
times
places
may
require
and
therefore
the
wisest
government
of
the
church
is
the
best
and
the
most
divine
and
every
christian
society
has
a
right
to
make
laws
for
itself
provided
that
these
laws
are
consistent
with
charity
and
peace
and
with
the
fundamental
doctrines
and
principles
of
christianity
of
this
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
christ
did
not
leave
this
matter
undetermined
but
established
his
church
government
as
explained
in
the
text
of
this
work
the
wisest
form
of
church
government
is
that
which
god
gave
it
is
at
the
same
time
the
best
and
not
only
the
most
divine
but
the
only
one
that
can
lay
any
claim
to
being
so
and
for
the
church
or
any
branch
thereof
to
establish
any
other
government
for
itself
is
an
unjustifiable
departure
from
the
order
of
roberts
authority
from
god
we
are
informed
in
the
scriptures
that
the
lord
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
paul
whom
he
had
called
to
be
his
servant
the
sick
were
healed
and
evil
spirits
were
cast
out
of
those
who
were
possessed
then
certain
of
the
vagabond
jews
exorcists
took
upon
them
to
call
over
them
which
had
evil
spirits
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
saying
we
adjure
you
by
jesus
whom
paul
preacheth
and
there
were
seven
sons
of
one
sceva
a
jew
and
chief
of
the
priests
which
did
so
and
the
evil
spirit
answered
and
said
jesus
i
know
and
paul
i
know
but
who
are
ye
and
the
man
in
whom
the
evil
spirit
was
leaped
on
them
and
overcame
them
and
prevailed
against
them
so
that
they
fled
out
of
the
house
naked
and
wounded
acts
xix
these
men
presumptuously
took
it
upon
themselves
to
act
as
those
who
had
authority
and
the
result
was
that
not
even
the
devils
would
respect
their
administrations
much
less
the
lord
there
is
a
principle
of
great
moment
associated
with
this
incident
the
question
is
if
these
men
when
acting
without
authority
from
god
could
not
drive
out
an
evil
spirit
would
their
administration
be
of
force
or
have
any
virtue
in
it
had
they
administered
in
some
other
ordinance
of
the
gospel
say
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
or
the
laying
on
of
hands
for
the
reception
of
the
holy
ghost
manifestly
it
would
not
hence
we
come
to
the
conclusion
so
well
expressed
in
one
of
our
articles
of
faith
a
man
must
be
called
of
god
by
prophecy
and
by

in

comment

christ
the
learned
mosheim
has
a
note
on
this
passage
in
which
his
aim
is
to
prove
that
the
correct
translation
from
the
greek
of
the
phrase
usually
rendered
they
gave
forth
their
lots
should
be
they
gave
their

while
it
is
but
proper
to
say
that
the
doctor
translation
is
very
generally
rejected
by
the
learned
still
there
will
be
no
question
with
those
who
understand
the
order
of
the
priesthood
and
the
manner
of
filling
vacancies
in
its
quorums
that
mosheim
is
correct
in
his
interpretation
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
passage

pentecost

acts
days
of
the
fifty

are
accounted
for
leaving

seven
days
between

think
it

here
to
call
the
attention

the
student
to
the
fact
that
the
principles
of
the
gospel
in
this
discourse
of
are
stated
in
the
same
order
that
they
were
unfolded
in
the
ministry

john
the
baptist
and
messiah
first
john
came
bearing
witness
of
one
who
should
come
after
him

hence
he
taught
faith
in
god
john
also
verses
after
that
the
burden
of
his
message
was
repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
then
followed
his
baptism
in
water
with
a
promise
that
they
should
receive
the
holy
ghost
so
peter
first
taught
the
people
faith
in
the
lord
proving
from
the
scripture
that
jesus
was
both
lord
and
christ
and
when
they
believed
that
then
he
taught
them
repentance
and
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
promised
them
the
holy
ghost
acts
acts
acts
acts
it
is
generally
supposed
by
biblical
scholars
mosheim
neander
kitto
murdock
and
many
others
that
these
men
were
deacons
only
there
is
nothing
however
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
or
other
parts
of
the
new
testament
which
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
such
was
the
case
we
have
evidence
on
the
other
hand
that
one
of
them
at
least
held
a
higher
priesthood
than
the
office
of
deacon
in
modern
revelation
we
have
it
stated
that
neither
teachers
nor
deacons
have
authority
to
baptize
administer
the
sacrament
or
lay
on
hands
for
the
holy
ghost
doc
and
sec
yet
we
have
philip
one
of
the
seven
going
down
into
samaria
teaching
the
gospel
and
baptizing
the
people
acts
viii
hence
we
may
know
that
he
held
a
higher
priesthood
than
that
of
deacon
yet
when
it
became
necessary
to
confer
the
holy
ghost
upon
these
same
converts
by
the
laying
on
of
hands
philip
it
would
seem
had
not
the
authority
to
do
it
but
the
apostles
hearing
that
samaria
had
received
the
word
sent
peter
and
john
down
and
they
conferred
upon
the
samaritans
the
holy
ghost
and
though
philip
was
present
he
appears
to
have
taken
no
part
in
it
it
is
therefore
reasonable
to
conclude
that
since
philip
had
authority
to
baptize
he
therefore
must
have
held
an
office
higher
than
that
of
deacon
or
even
of
teacher
but
since
he
evidently
had
not
authority
to
lay
on
hands
for
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
his
office
was
something
less
than
that
of
an
elder
hence
it
is
most
likely
that
he
was
a
priest
priests
have
the
right
to
baptize
but
not
to
lay
on
hands
for
the
reception
of
the
holy
ghost

the
student
will
observe
that
the
same
order
of
presenting
and
accepting
the
gospel
is
observed
in
the
account
given
of
its
introduction
into
samaria
as
was
observed
in

this
case
of
cornelius
marks
an
exception
the
only
one
recorded
in
the
new
testament
to
that
order
in
the
gospel
to
which
attention
has
been
drawn
several
times
in
this
section
that
is
these
gentiles
received
the
holy
ghost
before
baptism
in
water
the
object
of
the
deviation
from
the
rule
is
obvious
it
was
that
the
jews
might
have
a
witness
from
god
that
the
gospel
was
for
the
gentiles
as
well
as
for
the
house
of
israel
but
according
to
the
scriptures
and
i
may
say
according
to
the
nature
and
relationship
of
these
several
principles
and
ordinances
of
the
gospel
to
each
other

reception
of

the
persecution

forewarned
his
disciples
that
they
would
be
persecuted
by
the
world
pointed
out
the
reasons
for
it
and
comforted
them
by
reminding
them
that
the
world
had
hated
him
before
it
hated
them
that
the
servant
was
not
greater
than
his
lord
and
for
that
matter
all
the
prophets
which
were
before
them
had
been
persecuted
by
the
generations
in
which
they
lived
and
that
for
the
reason
that
they
were
not
of
the
world
therefore
the
world
hated
and
destroyed
them
two
special
reasons
may
be
assigned
for
the
persecution
of
the
saints
by
the
jews
they
looked
upon
christianity
as
a
rival
religion
to
judaism
a
thing
of
itself
sufficient
to
engender
bitterness
jealousy
persecution
if
christianity
should
live
and
obtain
a
respectable
standing
the
jews
of
that
generation
must
ever
be
looked
upon
as
not
only
putting
an
innocent
man
to
death
but
as
rejecting
and
slaying
the
son
of
god
to
crush
this
rival
religion
and
escape
the
odium
which
the
successful
establishment
of
it
would
inevitably
fix
upon
them
were
the
incentives
which
prompted
that
first
general
persecution
which
arose
against
the
church
in
jerusalem
and
that
commenced
in
the
very
first
year
after
messiah
ascension
the
extent
of
the
persecution
or
the
time
of
its
continuance
may
not
be
determined
but
that
it
was
murderous
may
be
learned
from
the
fact
that
stephen
was
slain
as
was
also
james
the
son
of
zebedee
and
james
the
just
brother
of
the
lord
the
apostle
peter
was
imprisoned
and
would
doubtless
have
shared
the
fate
of
the
other
martyrs
but
that
he
was
delivered
by
an
angel
nor
was
this
persecution
confined
alone
to
jerusalem
on
the
contrary
the
high
priests
and
elders
of
the
jews
in
palestine
conferred
with
the
jews
throughout
the
roman
provinces
and
everywhere
incited
them
to
hatred
of
the
christians
exhorting
them
to
have
no
connection
with
and
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
destroy
the
superstition
as
the
christian
religion
was
then
called
nor
were
they
content
with
what
they
themselves
could
do
but
they
exhausted
their
ingenuity
in
efforts
to
incite
the
romans
against
them
to
accomplish
this
they
charged
that
the
christians
had
treasonable
designs
against
the
roman
government
as
appeared
by
their
acknowledging
as
their
king
one
jesus
a
malefactor
whom
pilate
had
most
justly
put
to
death
the
jews
themselves
however
were
in
no
great
favor
with
the
romans
since
their
impatience
of
roman
restraint
led
them
to
be
constantly
on
the
eve
of
rebellion
and
sedition
and
frequently
to
break
out
into
deeds
of
violence
against
the
roman
authority
this
lack
of
favor
rendered
the
power
of
the
jews
unequal
to
their
malice
against
the
church
of
christ
the
imperious
nation
too
whose
forefathers
had
rejected
the
prophets
and
at
the
last
had
crucified
the
son
of
god
with
every
circumstance
of
cruelty
crying
out
in
the
streets
of
their
holy
city
crucify
him
and
let
his
blood
be
upon
us

on
our
children

about
to
meet
the
calamities
which
their
wickedness
called
down
upon
them
the
roman
emperor
vespasian
tired
of
their
repeated
seditions
at
last
sent
an
army
under
titus
to
subjugate
them
the
jews
made
a
stubborn
resistance
and
a
terrible
war
followed
jerusalem

with
people
who
had
come
into
the
city
from
the
surrounding
country

attend

passover
was
besieged
for
six
months
during
which
time
more
than
a
million
of
her
wretched
inhabitants
perished
of
famine
the
city
was
finally
taken
the
walls
thereof
thrown
down
and
the
temple
so
completely
destroyed
that
not
one
stone
was
left
upon
another
thousands
of
jews
were
cut
to
pieces
and
nearly
a

the
author
of

decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
claims
that
this
period
of
roman
history
was
the
golden
age
of
religious
liberty
and
such
was
the
multitude
of
deities
collected
in
rome
from
various
nations
and
such
the
variety
of
worship
to
be
seen
in
the
great
capital
of
the
empire
that
gibbon
has
said
rome
gradually
became
the
common
temple
of
her
subjects
and
the
freedom
of
the
city
was
bestowed
on
all
the
gods
of
mankind
furthermore
the
same
high
authority
says
the
various
modes
of
worship
which
prevailed
in
the
roman
world
were
all
considered
by
the
people
as
being
equally
true
by
the
philosophers
as
all
equally
false
and
by
the
magistrates
as
equally
useful
and
thus
toleration
produced
not
only
mutual
indulgences
but
even
religious
concord
the
student
who
would
learn
why
the
mild
and
beautiful
christian
religion
was
alone
selected
to
bear
the
wrath
and
feel
the
vengeful
power
of
rome
must
look
deeper
than
the
reasons
usually
assigned
for
the
strange
circumstance
it
is
superficial
to
say
that
the
persecution
was
caused
by
the
charges
of
immorality
the
roman
authorities
had
the
best
of
evidence
that
the
charges
were
false
see
note
end

equally
absurd
is
it
to
assign
as
a
cause
the
supposed
atheism
of
the
christians
for
that
was
the
condition
of
nearly
all
rome
while
the
charge
that
they
were
traitors
to
the
emperor

expected
to
see
the
empire
supplanted
by
the
kingdom

some

roman
persecution
was

the
true
cause
of
the
persecution
was
this
satan
knew
there
was
no
power
of
salvation
in
the
idolatrous
worship
of
the
heathen
and
hence
let
them
live
on
in
peace
but
when
jesus
of
nazareth
and
his
followers
came
in

authority
of
god
preaching
the
gospel
he
recognized
in
that
the
principles

against
which
he
had
rebelled
in
heaven
and
stirred
up
the
hearts
of
men
to
rebellion

the
truth

was
the

fourteen

it
was
in
vain
that
the

miserable
citizens
whose
all

difficult

determine
from

it
would
seem
that
the
decrees

were

as

afterwards
passed
by

the

discredited

pliny
testimony
to
the

of
the
the
character
which
this

gives
of

that

his
celebrated
letter
was
written
to
trajan
early
in

which
was
drawn
from
a
pretty
accurate
inquiry
because
he
considered
their
moral
principles
as
the
point
in
which
the
magistrate
was
interested
is
as
follows
he
tells
the
emperor
that
some
of
those
who
had
relinquished
the
society
or
who
to
save
themselves
pretended
that
they
had
relinquished
it
affirmed
that
they
were
wont
to
meet
together
on
a
stated
day
before
it
was
light
and
sang
among
themselves
alternately
a
hymn
to
christ
as
a
god
and
to
bind
themselves
by
an
oath
not
to
the
commission
of
any
wickedness

that
they
would
not

deny

asked

the

the

fact

is
that
the

suffered
most

allowed

to

edicts
of
early
in
the
third
century
a
law
was
enacted
by
the
emperor
severus
making
it
criminal
for
any
reason
to
abandon
the
religion
of
his
fathers
for
that
of
the
christians
or
the
jews
the
object
of
the
law
was
to
stay
the
propagation
of
christianity
which
was
spreading
abroad
on
every
hand
and
while
it
was
not
intended
to
increase
the
hardships
of
those
already
christians
it
nevertheless
encouraged
the
governors
and
judges
of
some
of
the
provinces
especially
those
of
egypt
and
other
parts
of
africa
and
asia
to
sorely
afflict
the
saints
many
of
the
poor
were
put
to
death
thousands
of
them
if
we
may
credit
eusebius
and
many
of
the
rich
intimidated
into
paying

this

after
it
subsided
there
was
a
long

it

that
we
have
to

the
severest
and
most
disastrous
persecution
of

the

the
emperor
must
have
been
impelled
both
by
his
fear
of
the
christians
and
his
attachment
to
the
ancient
religion
of
the
romans
to
publish
his
terrible
edicts
by
which
he
hoped
to
destroy
the
christian
church
the
governors
of

were
ordered
on

of
forfeiting
their
own
lives
either
to
exterminate
all
christians
utterly
or
bring
them
back
by
pains
and
tortures
to
the
religion
of
their
fathers
even
gibbon
whose
constant
effort
is
to
belittle
the
sufferings
of
the
early
christians
says
of
this
persecution
the
bishops
of
the
most
considerable
cities
were
removed
by
exile
or
death
the
vigilance
of
the
magistrates
prevented
the
clergy
of
rome
during
sixteen
months
from
proceeding
to
a
new
election
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
christians
that
the
emperor
would
more
patiently
endure
a
competitor
for
the
purple
than
a
bishop
in
the
capital
for
more
than
two
years
the
persecution
raged
with
unmitigated
fury
and
great
multitudes
of
christians
in
all
the
roman
provinces
were
butchered
in
the
most
inhuman
manner
this
persecution
writes
mosheim
was
more
cruel
and
terrific
than
any
which
preceded
it
and
immense
numbers
dismayed
not
so
much
by
the
fear
of
death
as
by
the
dread
of
the
long
continued
tortures
by
which
the
magistrates
endeavored
to
overcome
the
constancy
of
the
christians
professed
to
renounce
christ
and
procured
for
themselves
safety

by

the
immediate
successors
of
decius
continued
this
persecution
which
with
a
pestilential
disease
which
prevailed
in
many
of
the
roman
provinces
greatly
increased
the
hardships
of
the
saints
but
the

the
diocletian
in
the
commencement
of
the
fourth
century
a
peculiar
state
of
affairs
existed
in
the
roman
empire
in
diocletian
a
native
of
dalmatia
whose
parents
were
slaves
was
proclaimed
emperor
the
year
following
feeling
that
the
extent
of
the
empire
was
too
vast
to
be
managed
by
a
single
mind
he
chose
a
colleague
one
maximian
an
unlettered
soldier
with
whom
he
shared
the
authority
of
emperor
and
the
title
of
augustus
soon
afterwards
they
each
chose
a
colleague
with
whom
they
shared
their
authority
these
were
constantinus
chlorus
and
galerius
on
their
ascension
to
this
honor
they
each
took
the
title
of
caesar
and
so
matters
stood
at
the
opening
of
the
fourth
century
the
church
had
peace
at
the
opening
of
this
century
and
at
first
there
were
no
indications
that
it
would
be
broken
but
early
within
that
period
diocletian
was
persuaded
to
undertake
the
suppression
of
the
christian
religion
this
he
attempted
by
demanding
that
the
christians
give
up
their
sacred
books
if
they
refused
they
were
put
to
death
the
constancy
of
all
the
christians
no
not
even
that
of
all
their
bishops
and
clergy
was
equal
to
this
trial
and
many
voluntarily
surrendered
the
sacred
writings
in
their
possession
to
save
themselves
from
punishment
and
death
the
royal
palace
at
nicomedia
being
twice
set
on
fire
soon
after
the
first
edict
of
diocletian
was
published
the
crime
was
charged
to
the
christians
and
led
to
the
issuance
of
a
second
edict
which
caused
many
christians
to
suffer
the
penalties
inflicted
on
incendiaries
torture
and
death
following
this
came
rebellion
against
roman
authority
in
nicomedia
and
syria
this
too
was
charged
to
the
intrigue
of
christians
see
notes
and
end
of
section
and
was
made
a
pretext
for
throwing
all
bishops
and
ministers
into
prison
a
third
edict
authorized
the
employment
of
torture
to
compel
them
to
offer
sacrifices
to
the
gods
of
the
heathen
it
was
hoped
by
diocletian
that
if
these
leaders
of
the
church
could
be
forced
into
acts
of
apostasy
the
people
would
follow
a
great
multitude
therefore
of
excellent
men
in
all
parts
of
christendom
excepting
gaul
were
put
to
death
and
others
condemned
to
labor
in
the
mines
but
diocletian
was
disappointed
in
the
effects
of
these
assaults
on
the
leaders
of
the
church
the
members
thereof
remained
obdurate
in
their
adherence
to
the
christian
faith
whereupon
he
issued
a
fourth
edict
directing
the
magistrates
to
compel
all
christians
to
offer
sacrifice
to
the
gods
and
to
use
tortures
for
that
purpose
as
the
governors
yielded
strict
obedience
to
these
orders
the
christian
church
was
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
with
the
exception
of
gaul
says
schlegel
streams
of
christian
blood
flowed
in
the
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
everywhere
the
christian
temples
lay
in
ruins
and
assemblies
for
worship
were
all
suspended
the
major
part
had
forsaken
the
provinces
and
taken
refuge
among
the
barbarians
such
as
were
unable
or
unwilling
to
do
this
kept
themselves
concealed
and
were
afraid
for
their
lives
if
they
appeared
in
public
the
ministers
of
christ
were
either
slain
or
mutilated
and
sent
to
the
mines
or
banished
from
the
country
the
avaricious
magistrates
had
seized
upon
nearly
all
their
church
property
and
their
private
possessions
many
through
dread
of
undergoing
torture
had
made
away
with
their
own
lives
and
many
apostatized
from
the
faith
and
what
remained
of
the
christian
community
consisted
of
weak
poor

persons

him
to
make

the
circumstance
is
related
at
great
length
in
the
life
of
constantine
by
eusebius
on
whose
sole
authority
the
story
rests

story
is
altogether
rejected
by

writers
as
the
cunning
invention

priests
seeking
to
make
the
cross
an
object
of
veneration
and
even
christian
writers
of

standing

mosheim
consider
the
story
to
be
doubtful
constantine
and
his
friendliness
to
with
the
accession
of
constantine
to
the
imperial
throne
as
before
remarked
the
peace
of
the
church
was
assured
his
father
had
favored
the
christians
and
in
the
cruel
persecution
under
diocletian
he
kept
the
provinces
of
gaul
free
from
the
effusion
of
christian
blood
and
his
son
seems
to
have
fallen
heir
to
his
father
friendliness
for
the
christian
faith
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
motives
of
constantine
for
favoring
the
christian
cause
and
resolving
upon
the
destruction
of
the
pagan
religion
whether
it
was
the
appearance
of
the
miraculous
cross
in
the
heavens
as
some
aver
the
influence
of
helena
his
mother
as
theodoret
claims

through
the
arguments
of
an
egyptian
priest
who
promised
him
absolution
for
the
crime
of
murder
if
he
would
accept
christianity
but
let
the
motive
be
what
it
may
benevolence
policy
conviction
or
remorse
coupled
with
a
hope
of
forgiveness
constantine
from
the
time
of
his
accession
to
the
throne
became
the
avowed
protector
of
the
christian
church
and
at
length
by
his
powerful
influence
made
christianity
the
reigning
religion
of
the
roman
empire
the
exiles
were
recalled
those
condemned
to
labor
in
the
mines
were
released
those
who
had
been
robbed
of
their
property
were
reinstated
in

exalted

throne
of

yet
these
things
which
are
usually
accounted
among

good
fortunes
of

were
as
we

disastrous

but
it
is
to
be
feared
that
it
was
the
hope
of
wealth
and
honor
the
example
of
the
emperor
his
exhortations
his
irresistible
smile
rather
than
the
truths
of
christianity

wrought
a
change
in
the
hearts
of
the
obsequious
crowd
that
filled

palace
a
number
of
cities
manifested
a
forward
zeal
in
a
voluntary
destruction
of

but
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
municipal
distinctions
and
popular
donations
which
were
held
out
as
a
reward
for
such
conduct
rather
than
belief
in

christian

are
what
inspired

iconoclasts
twelve
thousand
men

the
conversion
of

great
number
nor
was
the
influence
of
constantine
in
respect
to
the
christian
religion
confined
within
the
provinces
of
the
empire
it
extended
to
the
barbarous
peoples
outside
who
while
they
had
held
in
disdain
a
despised
and
proscribed
sect
soon
learned
to
esteem
a
religion
which
had
been
so
lately
embraced
by
the
greatest
monarch
and
the
most
civilized
nation
of
the
globe
the
character
of
it
is
as
difficult
to
come
to
a
right
conclusion
as
to
the
real
character
of
constantine
as
it
is
to
decide
the
motives
which
led
him
to
accept
the
christian
religion
for
in
the
former
as
in
the
latter
case
the
authorities
are
conflicting
the
christians
who
were
favored
by
his
actions
extol
him
for
his
virtues
while
the
pagans
who
were
despoiled
by
him
execrate
him
for
his
crimes
it
is
certain
however
that
he
put
to
death
his
own
son
crispus
and
his
wife
fausta
on
a
suspicion
that
was
at
least
precarious
he
cut
off
his
licinius
and
his
offending
son
contrary
to
his
plighted
word
and
according
to
schlegel
and
gibbon
he
was
much
addicted
to
pride
and
voluptuousness
he
pursued
the
great
objects
of
his
ambition
through
the
dark
and
bloody
paths
of
war
and
policy
and
after
the
victory
abandoned
himself
without
moderation
to
the
abuse
of
his
good
fortune
as
he
advanced
in
years
he
seems
to
have
declined
in
the
practice
of
virtue
blighting
in
his
old
age
when
a
convert
to
the
christian
faith
and
famed
as
the
protector
of
the
christian
church
the
fair
promises
he
gave
in
his
youth
and
while
a
pagan
of
being
a
truly
virtuous
prince
it
is
not
likely
that
the
patronage
of
such
an
emperor
would
contribute
to
the
real
progress
of
religion
or
assist
in
the
establishment
of
the

by
the

at

had
lived
with

which
letter
is
entitled
a
relation
of
that
bishop
martyrdom
the
sufferings
say
they
of
all
the
other
martyrs
were
blessed
and
generous
which
they
underwent
according
to
the
will
of
god
for
so
it
becomes
us
who
are
more
religious
than
others
to
ascribe
the
power
and
ordering
of
all
things
unto
him
and
indeed
who
can
choose
but
admire
the
greatness
of
their
minds
and
that
admirable
patience
and
love
of
their
master
which
then
appeared
in
them
who
when
they
were
so
flayed
with
whipping
that
the
frame
and
structure
of
their
bodies
were
laid
open
to
their
very
inward
veins
and
arteries
nevertheless
endured
it
in
like
manner
those
who
were
condemned
to
the
beasts
and
kept
a
long
time
in
prison
underwent
many
cruel
torments
being
forced
to
lie
upon
sharp
spikes
laid
under
their
bodies
and
tormented
with
divers
other
sorts
of
punishments
that
so
if
it
were
possible
the
tyrants
by
the
length
of
their
sufferings
might
have
brought
them
to
deny
paley
the
persecution
under
decius
this
persecution
was
more
terrible
than
any
preceding
one
because
it
extended
over
the
whole
empire
and
because
its
object
was
to
worry
the
christians
into
apostasy

extreme
and
persevering
the
certificated
or
libellatici
are
supposed
to
be
such
as
purchased
certificates
from
the
corrupt
magistrates
in
which
it
was
declared
that
they
were
pagans
and
had
complied
with
the
demands
of
the
law
when
neither
of
these
was
fact
to
purchase
such
a
certificate
was
not
only
to
be
partaker
in
the
fraudulent
transaction
but
it
was
to
prevaricate
before
the
public
in
regard
to
christianity
and
was
inconsistent
with
that
open
confession
of
christ
before
men
which

the
insurrection
of
syria
and
some
degree
of
probability
could
be
attached
to
the
charge
against
the
christians
of
causing
the
insurrection
from
the
fact
that
their
inconsiderate
zeal
sometimes
led
them
to
deeds
which
had
an
aspect
of
rebellion
at
the
commencement
of
this
persecution
for
example
a
very
respectable
christian
tore
down
the
imperial
edict
against
the
christians
which
was
set
up
in
a
public
schlegel
unwise
zeal
of
the
several
examples
have
been
preserved
of
a
zeal
impatient
of
those
restraints
which
the
emperors
had
provided
for
the
security
of
the
church
the
christians
sometimes
supplied
by
their
voluntary
declaration
the
want
of
an
accuser

disturbed
the
public
service
of
paganism
and
rushing
in
crowds
round
the
tribunal
of
the
magistrates
called
upon
them
to
pronounce
and
to
inflict
the
sentence
of
the
law
the
behavior
of
the
christians
was
too
remarkable
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
ancient
philosophers
but
they
seemed
to
have
considered
it
with
much
less
admiration
than
astonishment
incapable
of
conceiving
the
motives
which
sometimes
transported
the
fortitude
of
believers
beyond
the
bounds
of
prudence
or
reason
they
treated
such
an
eagerness
to
die
as
the
strange
result
of
obstinate
despair
of
stupid
insensibility
or
of
suspicious
gibbon
spirit
of
the
christian
the
spirit
of
the
christian
martyrs
at
least
of
the
first
three
centuries
may
be
learned
from
the
epistle
of
ignatius
of
antioch
who
early
in
the
second
century
was
taken
from
syria
to
rome
where
he
suffered
martyrdom
by
being
thrown
to
the
wild
beasts
on
his
journey
to
rome
under
sentence
of
death
he
wrote
an
epistle
to
the
roman
saints
from
which
the
following
passage
is
taken
i
write
to
the
churches
and
i
declare
to
all
that
willingly
i
die
for
god
if
it
be
that
you
hinder
me
not
i
beg
of
you
do
not
become
to
me
an
unseasonable
love
let
me
be
of
the
beasts
by
whose
means
i
am
enabled
to
obtain
god
i
am
god
wheat
and
by
the
teeth
of
the
beasts
am
i
ground
that
i
may
be
found

pure
bread
rather
entreat
kindly
the
beasts
that
they
may
be
a
grave
for
me
and
may
leave
nothing
of
my
body
that
not
even
when
i
am
fallen
asleep
i
may
be
a
burden
upon
any
man
then
i
shall
be
in
truth
a
disciple
of
jesus
christ
when
the
world
seeth
not
even
my
body
supplicate
our
lord
for
me
that
by
these
instruments
i
may
be
found
a
sacrifice
to
god
i
am
not
commanding
you
like
peter
and
paul
they
were
apostles
i
am
a
condemned
convict
they
were
free
i
am
hitherto
a
slave
but
if
i
suffer
i
am
a
free
man
of
jesus
christ
and
i
shall
rise
from
the
dead
in
him
a
free
man
and
now
since
i
am
in
bonds
i
learn
to
desire
nothing
from
syria
to
rome
i
am
cast
among
beasts
by
sea
and
by
land
by
night
and
by
day
since
i
am
bound
between
ten
leopards
who
get
worse
when
i
do
good
to
them
but
by
their
i
am
furthered
in
my
apprenticeship
still
by
that
i
am
not
justified
may
i
have
to
rejoice
of
the
beasts
prepared
for
me
and
i
pray
that
they
may
be
found
ready
for
me
and
i
will
kindly
entreat
them
quickly
to
devour
me
and
not
as
they
have
done
to
some
being
afraid
of
them
to
keep
from
touching
me
and
should
they
not
be
willing

the
accusations
of
the
the
simplicity

the
christian
religion
was
made
a
reproach
to
the
church
of
christ
by
the
pagan
priests
the
saints
were
accused
of
atheism
an
accusation
which
found
support
in
the
fact
that
the
primitive
church
had
no
temples
no
incense
no
sacrifice
no
incantations
pomp
or
ceremony
in
its
worship
the
christians
have
no
temples
therefore
they
have
no
gods
was
an
argument
sufficiently
convincing
to
the
heathen
it
was
but
natural
perhaps
that
the
christians
should
seek
to
cast
off
this
reproach
but
the
desire
to
do
so
led
to
the
introduction
of
many
ceremonies
quite
at
variance
with
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
and
eventually
subverted

altogether
outward
ordinances
of
the
christian
the
outward
ordinances
of
the
gospel
consisted
of

laying

the
laying
on

was
also
employed
in

men
to
the
priesthood

in
administering

the
sick
in

it
was
accompanied
by
anointing
with
oil
while
it
does
not
appear
that
there
was
any
specific
law
commanding
or

the
ancient
saints
occasionally
joined
abstinence
from
their
food
with

engaged

undertakings

baptism
was
administered
by
immersing

candidate
in
water
the
only
were
faith
in

and
repentance
as
soon
as
the
candidate
professed
these
he
was
admitted
into
the
church
by
baptism
in
a
short
time
however
the
simplicity
of
this
ordinance
was
corrupted
and
burdened
with
useless
ceremonies
in
the
second
century
the
newly
baptized
converts
since
by
baptism
they
had
been
born
again
were
taught
to
exhibit
in
their
conduct
the
innocence
of
little
infants
milk
and
honey
the
common
food
of
infants
were
administered
to
them
after
their
baptism
to
remind
them
of
their
infancy
in
the
church
moreover
since
by
baptism
they
were
released
from
being
servants
of
the
devil
and
became
free
men
certain
forms
borrowed
from
the
roman
ceremony
of
manumission
of
slaves
were
employed
in
baptism
as
by
baptism
also
they
were
supposed
to
be
made
god
soldiers
like
newly
enlisted
soldiers
in
the
roman
army
they
were
sworn
to
obey
their
commander
etc
further
additions
of
ceremonies
to
a
century
later
the
third
further
ceremonies
were
added
it
was
supposed
that
some
evil
spirit
was
resident
in
all
vicious
persons
and
impelled
them
to
sin
therefore
before
entering
the
sacred
font
for
baptism
an
exorcist
by
a
solemn
menacing
formula
declared
them
free
from
the
bondage
of
satan
and
hailed
them
servants
of
christ
after
baptism
the
new
converts
returned
home
decorated
with
a
crown
and
a
white
robe
the
first
being
indicative
of
their
victory
over
the
world
and
their
lusts
the
latter
of
their
acquired
innocence
we
have
already
noted
the
fact
that
baptism
was
administered
in
the
days
of
the
apostles
as
soon
as
profession
of
faith
and
repentance
were
declared
but
in
the
second
and
third
century
baptism
was
only
administered
twice
a
year
and
then
only
to
such
candidates
as
had
gone
through
a
long
preparation
and
trial
the
times
chosen
for
the
administration
of
the
ordinance
were
on
the
vigils
of
easter
and
whitsuntide
and
in
the
fourth
century
it
had
become
the
custom
to
accompany
the
ceremony
with
lighted
wax
candles
to
put
salt
an
emblem
of
purity
and
wisdom
in
the
mouth
of
the
baptized
and
everywhere
a
double
anointing
was
administered
to
the
candidates
the
one
before
the
other
after
baptism
the
form
of
baptism
it
must
have
been
early
in
the
third
century
that
the
form
of
baptism
began
to
be
changed
up
to
this
time
it
had
been
performed
only
by
immersion
of
the
whole
body
but
in
the
first
half
of
the
third
century
cyprian
bishop
of
carthage
during
a
controversy
respecting
the
of
those
who
in
times
of
persecution
had
denied
the
faith
decided
that
those
whose
weak
state
of
health
did
not
permit
them
to
be
immersed
were
sufficiently
baptized
by
being
sprinkled
the
first
case
of
this
kind
of
baptism
is
related
by
eusebius
the
person
to
whom
it
was
so
administered
was
novatus
a
desperate
heretic
who
created
a
schism
in
the
church
and
became
the
founder
of
a
sect
he
was
among
the
number
of
christians
who
put
off
baptism
as
long
as
he
dared
in
order
to
enjoy
a
life
of
sin
and
then
through
baptism
just
before
death
obtain
forgiveness
for
them
a
custom
very
prevalent
in
those
times
novatus
being
attacked
with
an
obstinate
disease
and
supposed
to
be
at
the
point
of
death
was
baptized
by
having
water
sprinkled
upon
him
as
he
lay
in
bed
if
indeed
says
eusebius
it
be
proper
to
say
one
like
him
did
receive
baptism
this
innovation
continued
to
spread
until
now
the
general
rule
among
christian
sects
is
to
baptize
by
sprinkling
or
pouring
for
this
change
there
is
no
warrant
of
revelation
it
destroys
the
symbol
there
is
in
baptism
as
taught
by
messiah
and
his
apostles
that
of
a
burial
and
resurrection
of
a
death
and
a
birth
a
death
unto
sin
a
birth

sin
a

innovations
which

ordinance

about
the
time
that
the
form
of
administering
baptism
was
changed
it
began
to

just
when

no
truth
is
more
plainly
taught
by
the
apostles
than
that
baptism
is
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
must
be
preceded
by
faith
and
repentance
and
as
infants
are
incapable
of
sin
or
of
exercising
faith
or
of
repenting
evidently
they
are
not
fit
subjects
for
baptism
still
it
became
the
custom
in
the

part
of

second
century

early
in

to
baptize
infants
in
the
year
a
council
of
sixty
bishops
in

at
which
cyprian
bishop
of

presided
took
under
consideration
the
question
whether
infants
should
be
baptized
within
two
or
three
days
after
birth
or
whether
it
should
be
deferred
until
the
eighth
day
as
was
the
custom
of
the
jews
in
respect
to
circumcision
the
council
decided
that
they
should
be
baptized
at
once
that
is
within
a
day
or
two
after
birth
it
will
be
observed
that
the
question
was
not
as
to
whether
infants
should
be
baptized
or
not
but
when
they
should
be
baptized
within
a
day
or
two
after
birth
or
not
until
they
were
eight
days
old
the
matter
was
treated
in
the
council
as
if
infant
baptism
was
a
custom
of
long
standing
this
proves
not
that
infant
baptism
is
a
correct
doctrine
or
that
it
was
derived
from
the
teachings
and
examples
of
the
apostles
as
some
aver
but
that
in
a
century
or
so
after
the
introduction
of
the
gospel
men
began
to
pervert
it
by
changing
and
misapplying
its
ordinances
the
false
doctrine
of
infant
baptism
is
now
practiced
by
nearly
all
christian
churches
catholic
and
protestant
the
much
as
the
simple
rite
of
baptism
was
burdened
with
useless
ceremonies
changed
in
its
form
and
misapplied
it
was
not
more
distorted
than
was
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
the
nature
of
the
sacrament
usually
called
the
eucharist
and
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
instituted
are
so
plain
that
he
who
runs
may
read
from
paul
description
of
the
ordinance
it
is
clear
that
the
broken
bread
was
an
emblem
of
messiah
broken
body
the
wine
an
emblem
of
his
blood
shed
for
sinful
man
and
his
disciples
were
to
eat
the
one
and
drink
the
other
in
remembrance
of
him
until
he
should
return
and
by
this
ceremony
show
forth
the
lord
death
it
was
designed
as
a
memorial
of
messiah
great
atonement
for
mankind
a
token
and
witness
unto
the
father
that
the
son
was
always
remembered
it
was
to
be
a
sign
that
those
partaking
of
it
were
willing
to
take
upon
them
the
name
of
christ
to
always
remember
him
and
keep
his
commandments
in
consideration
of
these
things
being
observed
the
saints
were
always
to
have
the
spirit
of
the
lord
to
be
with
them
in
this
spirit

were

arose

some

most
suitable
time
all
were
not
agreed
either
as
to
how
often

should
be
celebrated
gold
and
silver
vessels
were
used
and
neither
those
doing
penance
nor
those
unbaptized
though
believers
were
permitted
to
be
present
at
the
celebration
of
the
ordinance
which
practice
it
is
well
known
was
derived
from
the
pagan
mysteries
very
much
of
mystery
began
to
be
associated
with
it
even
at
an
early
date
the
bread
and
the
wine
through
the
prayer
of
consecration
were
considered
to
undergo
a
mystic
change
by
which
they
were
converted
into
and
became
the
very
body
and
the
very
blood
of
jesus
christ
so
that
they
were
no
longer
regarded
as
emblems
of
messiah
body
and
blood
but
the
body
and
blood
itself
this
is
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
the
dogma
established
it
was
but
a
short
step
to
the
elevation
of
the
host
that
is
the
elevation
of
the
bread
and
wine
before
they
were
distributed
so
that
they
might
be
viewed
with
reverence
by
the
people
thus
came
the
adoration
of
the
symbols
institution
of
the
hence
came
also
the
mass
or
the
idea
of
a
sacrifice
being
connected
with
the
celebration
of
the
eucharist
it
was
held
that
as
jesus
was
truly
present
in
the
bread
and
wine
he
could
be
offered
up
and
was
truly
offered
up
as
an
oblation
to
his
eternal
father
the
death
of
the
victim
was
not
supposed
to
occur
in
reality
but
mystically
in
such
a
way
however
as
to
constitute
a
true
sacrifice
commemorative
of
that
of
the
cross
and
not
different
from
it
in
essence
the
same
victim
was
present
and
offered
up
by
christ
through
his
minister
the
priest
the
sacrifice
at
the
cross
was
offered
with
real
suffering
true
shedding
of
blood
and
real
death
of
the
victim
in
the
mass
it
was
taught
there
was
a
mystical
shedding
of
blood
and
a
mystical
death
of
the
same
victim
into
such
absurdities
was
the
simple
sacrament
of
the
supper
distorted
when
attended
with
all
the
pomp
and
ceremony
of
splendid
altars
lighted
tapers
processions
elevations
and
chantings
offered
up
by
priests
and
bishops
clad
in
splendid
vestments
and
in
the
midst
of
clouds
of
incense
accompanied
by
mystic
movements
and
genuflections
of
bishops
and
priests
the
church
could
congratulate
itself
on
having
removed
the
reproach
at
the
first
fastened
upon
the
christians
for
not
having
altars
and
sacrifice
the
mass
took
away
the
reproach
and
the
new
converts
to
christianity
were
accustomed
to
see
the
same
rites
and
ceremonies
employed
in
this
mystical
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
as
they
had

employed

species

christians
celebrated
the

supper
which
they
were
accustomed
to
do
chiefly
on
sundays
they
consecrated
a
part
of
the
bread
and
wine

the
oblations
by
certain
prayers
pronounced
by
the
president
the
bishop
of
the
congregation
the
wine
was
mixed
with
water
and
the
bread
was
divided
into
small
pieces
portions
of
the
consecrated
bread
and
wine
were
commonly
sent
to
the
absent
and
the
sick
in
testimony
of
fraternal
affection
towards
them

is
much
evidence

this

holy
rite
was
regarded
as
very
necessary

the
attainment

rites

rites

which
formerly
the
greeks

romans

other
nations
had
manifested
their
piety
and
reverence
towards
their
imaginary
deities
supposing
that
the
people
would
more
readily
embrace
christianity
if
they
saw
that
the
rites
handed
down
to
them
from
their
fathers
still
existed
unchanged

the
christians

perceived
that
christ
and
the
martyrs
were
worshiped
in
the
same
manner

formerly
their
gods
were
there
was
of

little
difference

these
times

the
public
worship

the
christians

fact

that
aside
from
filling
up
the
vacancy
in
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
occasioned
by
the
fall
of
judas
iscariot
there
is
no
account
in

of

writings
of
the
apostles
or
fathers
of

eastern

of
any
attempt

perpetuate
the

vacancies
occasioned

death
of

the
same
may
also
be
said
of

seventies
the
reason
for
this
will
doubtless
be
found
in
the
fact
that
in
the
very
days
of
the
apostles
the
great
apostasy
which
was
to
end
eventually
in
the
subversion
of
the
christian
religion
had
begun

note
end
of

and
since
the
mystery
of
iniquity
had
already
begun
its
work
in
the
days
of
the
apostles
and
men
were
rapidly
proving
themselves
unworthy
of
the
church
of
christ
the
lord
did
not
permit
his
servants
to
perpetuate
these
quorums
of
the

priesthood
establishment
of
the
church
by
the
whenever
in
their
travels
the
apostles
converted
any
considerable
number
of
persons
in
a
city
or
district
they
organized
them
into
a
church
or
speaking
more
precisely
into
a
branch
of
the
great
universal
church
of
christ
and
appointed
either
a
bishop
or
an
elder
to
preside
over
them
as
long
as
the
apostles
lived
they
were
regarded
as
the
presiding
authority
of
the
universal
church
and
were
looked
to
for
counsel
and
instruction
in
all
difficult
matters
that
arose
concerning
doctrine
or
discipline
their
decisions
were
accepted
as
final
and
well
might
it
be
so
since
these
men
were
guided
in
their
counsels
by
revelation
as
well
as
by
the
wisdom
which
their
large
experience
in
company
with
jesus
christ
had
given
them
but
when
the
apostles
died
and
no
one
succeeded
to
their
authority
the
branches
of
the
church
were
left
separate
and
independent
organizations
united

the

of

in

and
in
the
greater
part
of
the
second

were
limited
to
conducting

ordinances

gospel

which
arose
between

equality
among

this
equality
of

among
the

together
with
the
simple
form
of

government
described

was

the

of

bishops
presiding
in

city
very
naturally
perhaps
felt
themselves
under
the
protection
and
dependent
upon
the
city
bishops
this
idea
continued
to
grow
until
these
bishops
of
the
suburbs
and
the
fields
were
looked
upon
as
a
distinct
order
of
officers
possessing
a
dignity
and
authority
above
the
elders
and
yet
subordinate
to
the
bishops

came

origin
of
gradually
and
almost
imperceptibly

government
began
to
follow
the
civil
divisions
of
the
roman
empire
the
bishops
of
the
metropolis
of

civil
province

time
came
to
be
regarded
as
having
a
general
supervision
of
all
the
churches
in

province
over

archbishops
and

over
the
suburban
bishops

as
they
began
to
be
called
and
finally

the
bishops
of
these
provinces
were

the
rise
and
influence
of
concurrent
with
these
changes
arose
the
custom
first
derived
from
the
greeks
of
holding
provincial
councils
the
bishops
living
in
a
single
province
met
in
council
to
confer
upon
matters
of
common
interest
to
the
churches
of
the
province
these
provincial
councils
met
at
stated
times
of
the
year
usually
in
the
spring
and
autumn
at
the
first
the
attending
bishops
looked
upon
themselves
as
merely
the
representatives
of
their
respective
churches
without
jurisdiction
further
than
to
discuss
and
come
to
agreement
on
matters
of
common
concern
but
gradually
they
usurped
the
power
to
order
by
decree
where
at
first
they
were
accustomed
to
advise
or
entreat
so
easy
is
it
to
change
the
language
of
exhortation
to
that
of
command
nor
was
it
long
ere
the
decrees
of
these
provincial
councils
were
forced
upon
the
respective
churches
as
laws
to
be
implicitly
obeyed
there
was
some
resistance
to
this
at
first
from
the
lower
orders
of
the
clergy
but
that
resistance
was
quickly
overcome
by
the
activity
and
ambition
of
the
bishops
who
were
only
too
glad
to
escape
from
the
restraints
which
the
doctrine
of
common
consent

doctrine

made
it
necessary
for

completely
modeled

to
witness
more
pride

in

increase
of
vices
both
in

and
people
early
in
this
century
it
will
be
remembered
constantine
the
emperor
of
rome
avowed
his
conversion
to
christianity
and
as
might
have
been
expected
that
fact
produced
great
changes
in
the
fortunes
of
the
church
it
not
only
put
an
end
to
its
persecutions
but
loaded
its
bishops
with
new
honors
and
enlarged
powers
in
saying
that
the
church
government
was
modeled
upon
the
plan
of
the
civil
government
we
would
not
be
understood
as
saying
that
the
first
was
a
of
the
second
there
were
some
differences
between
them
but
the
civil
divisions
of
the
empire
suggested
the
ecclesiastical
divisions
under
constantine
the
roman
empire
was
divided
into
four
prefectures
containing
thirteen
dioceses
embracing
one
hundred
and
sixteen
provinces
officers
called
praetorian
prefects
presided
over
the
four
prefectures
exarchs
over
the
dioceses
and
governors
over
the
provinces
the
bishops
of
rome
constantinople
antioch
and
alexandria
having
gained
a
over
all
other
metropolitans
were
made
to
correspond
with
the
four
prefectures
by
constantine
and
assumed
before
the
close
of
the
century
the
title
of
patriarchs
next
to
the
patriarchs
stood
the
bishops
whose
jurisdiction
extended
over
several
provinces
corresponding
to
the
civil
exarchs
though
the
bishops
of
this
dignity
did
not
equal
in
number
the
civil
exarchs
next
came
the
metropolitan
bishops
whose
jurisdiction
was
limited
to
a
single
province
they
corresponded
to
the
civil
governors
of
the
provinces
whose
authority
was
limited
in
like
manner
after
the
metropolitans
came
the
and
then
the
bishops
some
of
the
latter
were
exempt
from
the
jurisdiction
of
both
metropolitans
and
and
hence
were
called
independent
bishops
of
the
bishops
of
the
distinctions
of
rank
among
the
bishops
of
the
christian
church
first
arose
largely
through
the
opulence
and
civil
importance
of
the
respective
cities
and
provinces
over
which
they
presided
the
membership
of
the
church
and
its
wealth
usually
bearing
a
just
proportion
to
the
size
and
civil
importance
of
the
city
in
which
it
was
located
it
is
not
surprisingg
therefore
that
the
metropolitans
and
patriarchs
also
struggled
for
upon
the
same
basis
that
basis
gave
the
bishop
of
rome
great
advantage
for
as
stated
by
gibbon
the
roman
church
was
the
greatest
the
most
numerous
and
in
regard
to
the
west
the
most
ancient
of
all
the
christian
establishments
many
of
which
had
received
their
religion
from
the
pious
labors
of
here
missionaries
the
fact
too
that
for
so
many
ages
rome
had
been
the
capital
of
the
great
empire
led
men
naturally
to
give
to
the
church
established
there
another
thing
which
went
far
to
establish
the
supremacy
of
the
bishop
of
rome
was
the
tradition
that
peter
the
chief
or
prince
of
the
apostles
had
founded
that
church
that
he
became
its
first
bishop
that
the
bishops
succeeding
him
succeeded
to
his
apostleship
and
to
whatever
of
he
held
over
his
fellow
apostles
and
that
it
is
claimed
amounted
to
the
right
of
presidency
over
the
universal
church
objections
to
the
claims
of
the
bishop
of
that
peter
aided
by
paul
did
found
the
church
at
rome
there
is
little
cause
to
doubt
it
is
also
true
that
peter
was
the
chief
or
president
of
the
apostles
that
to
him
had
been
given
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
that
he
became
the
bishop
of
rome
or
that
the
bishops
of
rome
succeeded
to
the
apostleship
and
to
that
power
which
made
him
the
president
of
the
universal
church
of
christ
we
can
not
allow
our
first
reason
for
saying
that
peter
was
not
bishop
of
rome
is
that
the
office
of
apostle
and
bishop
are
not
identical
if
peter
presided
at
all
over
the
church
at
rome
he
did
so
by
virtue
of
his
apostleship
not
by
becoming
its
bishop
but
as
his
apostleship
would
give
him
the
right
to
act
in
minor
offices
of
the
church
on
the
principle
that
the
greater
authority
includes
the
lesser
he
may
have
presided
for
a
time
over
the
church
at
rome
our
second
reason
is
that
according
to
the
very
best
authority
on
the
subject
one
linus
and
not
peter
was
the
first
bishop
of
rome
irenaeus
writing
in
the
second
century
says
the
blessed
apostles
peter
and
paul
then
upon
founding
and
erecting
the
church
at
rome
committed
the
office
of
administering
the
church
to
linus
of
this
linus
paul
speaks
in
the
epistle
to
timothy
to
him
succeeded
anacletus
and
after
him
in
the
third
place
from
the
apostles
clement
received
the
bishopric
from
this
it
plainly
appears
that
peter
and
paul
organized
a
church
at
rome
and
as
in
other
cities
they
appointed
a
bishop
to
preside
over
it
peter
no
more
became
the
bishop
of
rome
than
he
did
of
the
church
at
jerusalem
or
paul
of
antioch
ephesus
or
corinth
the
bishop
of
rome
did
not
succeed
to
the
apostleship
of
peter
much
less
to
the
which
he
held
among
the
apostles
and
that
for
the
very
good
reason
that
the
office
of
bishop
and
that
of
apostle
as
remarked
above
are
not
identical
it
would
require
an
apostle
to
succeed
an
apostle
and
as
there
is
no
account
of
an
apostle
being
ordained
to
succeed
to
peter
office
we
conclude
he
had
no
successor
here
we
might
let
the
matter
rest
but
it
will
be
proper
to
notice
the
arguments
which
are
made
by
those
who
contend
that
the
bishops
of
rome
are
the
true
successors
to
the
office
and
mission
of
the
apostle
peter
scripture
basis
of
the
claims
of
the
bishop
of
rome
to
on
one
occasion
jesus
said
to
his
disciples
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
and
simon
peter
answered
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
to
this
jesus
said
blessed
art
thou
simon
barjona
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
thee
but
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
and
i
say
unto
thee
that
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
he
then
gave
to
peter
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
power
to
bind
and
loose
on
earth
and
in
heaven
the
argument
is
that
since
peter
some
time
before
this
had
been
given
the
name
cephas
which
means
a
stone
therefore
when
jesus
said
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
it
is
claimed
that
he
meant
than
on
peter
he
would
build
his
church
that
this
is
a
clear
misconception
of
the
scripture
is
apparent
if
messiah
had
meant
to
found
the
church
on
peter
how
unfortunate
that
he
did
not
say
thou
art
cephas
a
stone
and
upon
will
i
build
my
church
etc
but
he
did
not
he
first
assured
peter
that
the
knowledge
he
had
received
that
jesus
was
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
was
received
by
revelation
from
god
and
i
say
unto
thee
that
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
principle
will
i
build
my
church
etc
upon
the
principle
of
god
revealing
to
men
that
jesus
was
the
christ
on
the
principle
of
revelation
another
passage
quoted
in
support
of
the
theory
that
the
apostles
had
successors
in
the
bishops
of
rome
is
found
in
the
following
jesus
after
his
resurrection
said
to
his
apostles
all
power
is
given
unto
me
in
heaven
and
in
earth
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
and
lo
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
this
is
the
argument
the
apostles
themselves
were
only
to
live
the
ordinary
term
of
man
life
therefore
the
commission
of
preaching
and
ministering
together
with
the
promise
of
divine
assistance
regards
the
successors
of
the
apostles
no
less
than
the
apostles
themselves
this
proves
that
there
must
have
been
an
uninterrupted
series
of
successors
of
the
apostles
in
every
age
since
their
time
that
is
to
say
successors
to
their
doctrine
to
their
jurisdiction
to
their
orders
and
to
their
mission
against
this
argument
we
put
that
of
the
late
apostle
orson
pratt
we
do
not
admit
that
the
promise
lo
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
had
any
reference
to
any
persons
whatever
only
the
eleven
disciples
mentioned
they
were
the
only
persons
whom
he
jesus
addressed
and
to
whom
he
made
this
great
promise
but
says
milner
they
were
only
to
live
the
ordinary
term
of
man
life
and
consequently
he
draws
the
conclusion
that
the
promise
could
not
be
fulfilled
to
them
without
successors
according
to
this
curious
inference
of
the
learned
bishop
the
lord
must
have
forsaken
the
eleven
disciples
as
soon
as
they
died
for
if
he
admit
that
jesus
continued
with
them
after
the
period
of
the

however
the

peoples

everywhere
they
went
they
taught
submission
to

not
only
did

send

to
the

but
the
barbarians
came

they
came
with

in

and
as
conquerors
it
is
true
and
in

obtained

as
humble
submission
to
the
wand
of
the

another
reason
why
the
roman
pontiff
outstripped
his
eastern
rival
in
the
struggle
for
supremacy
will
be
found
in
the
superstitious
reverence
in
which
the
barbarous
nations
that
fell
under
the
influence
of
roman
missionaries
were
accustomed
to
hold
their

the
chief
druid
was
actually
worshiped
when
these
people
became
christians
they
supposed
that
the
bishop
of
rome
was
such
a
chief
druid
and
that
the
must
be
honored
accordingly
and
this
was
one
cause
why
the
roman
pontiff
obtained
in
process
of
time
such
an
ascendency
in
the
western
countries
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
rose
indeed
to
a
great
elevation
but
he
never
attained
the
high
rank
and
authority
of
the
roman
patriarch
the
reason
was
that
the
people
of
the

had
not
the

of

of

this
plan
was
undoubtedly
suggested
to
him
by
the
roman
pontiff
who
persuaded
the
emperor
perhaps
by
showing
him
some
ancient
though
forged
papers
and
documents
that
constantine
the
great
to
whose
place
and

charles
now
succeeded
when
he
removed
the
seat
of

possession

we

causes
and
manner
of
it
appears
to
have
been
the
custom
of
the
apostles
in
the
case
of
members
of
the
church
grievously
transgressing
the
moral
law
of
the
gospel
to
require
repentance
and
confession
before
the
church
and
in
the
event
of
a
stubborn
adherence
to
sin
the
offender
was
excommunicated
that
is
he
was
excluded
from
the
communion
of
the
church
and
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
for
the
crimes
of
murder
idolatry
and
adultery
some
of
the
churches
excommunicated
those
guilty
of
them
forever
in
other
churches
they
were
received
back
but
only
after
long
and
painful
probation
the
manner
in
which
excommunication
was
performed
in
apostolic
times
is
not
clear
but
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
the
process
was
very
simple
in
the
course
of
time
however
this
simple
order
of
excommunication
was
changed
by
being
burdened
with
many
rites
and
ceremonies
borrowed
from
pagan
sources
it
was
not
enough
that
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
be
withdrawn
from
the
offender
and
he
left
to
the
mercy
of
god
or
the
buffetings
of
satan
according
as
he
was
worthy
of
the
one
or
the
other
but
the
church
must
load
him
down
with
anathemas
too
terrible
to
contemplate
the
power
of
excommunication
too
eventually
passed
from
the
body
of
the
church
into
the
hands
of
the
bishops
and
finally
into
those
of
the
pope
at
first
excommunication
meant
the
loss
of
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
and
such
other
punishments
as
god
himself
might
see
fit
to
inflict
the
church
leaving
the
lord
to
be
the
minister
of
his
own
vengeance
but
gradually
it
came
to
mean
in
some
instances
banishment
from
home
and
country
the
confiscation
of
property
the
loss
not
only
of
religious
fellowship
with
the
saints
but
the
loss
of
civil
rights
and
the
rights
of
christian
burial
in
the
case
of
a
monarch
excommunication
absolved
his
subjects
from
their
allegiance
and
in
the
case
of
a
subject
it
robbed
him
of
the
protection
of
his
sovereign
no
anathema
was
so
terrible
but
it
was
pronounced
against
the
excommunicated
until
the
sweet
mercies
of
god
were
overshadowed
by
the
black
pall
of
inhumanity
admixture
of
pagan
philosophy
with
the
christian
the
thing
which
contributed
most
to
the
subversion
of
the
christian
religion
was
the
employment
of
pagan
philosophy
to
explain
christian
doctrine
this
brought
about
an
admixture
of
these
two
discordant
elements
that
while
it
failed
to
purge
pagan
philosophy
of
its
errors
corrupted
the
doctrines
of
christ
and
laid
the
foundations
for
those
false
notions
in
respect
of
god
which
obtain
in
the
christian
world

holy
ghost
descend
upon
him
and
at
the
same
time
the
voice
of
the
father
was
heard
speaking
from
heaven
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
here
we
have
the
persons
of
the
godhead
present
but
distinct
from
each
other
stephen
the
martyr
in
the
presence
of
the
angry
crowd
which
took
his
life
saw
the
heavens
open
and
jesus
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
here
too
the
father
and
son
are
seen
and
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
holy
man
they
are
distinct
personalities
yet
jesus
said
to
the
jews
i
and
my
father
are
one
believe
that
the
father
is
in
me
and
i
in
him
but
this
oneness
can
not
have
reference
to
the
persons
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
which
we
have
seen
are
distinct
their
oneness
therefore
must
consist
in
a
unity

attributes

jesus
in
his
great
prayer
just
previous
to
his
betrayal
said
in
praying
for
his
disciples
holy
father
keep
through
thine
own
name
those
whom
thou
hast
given
me
that
they
may
be
one
that
they
all
may
be
one
as
thou
father
art
in
me

i
in
thee
that
they
also
may
be

clearly
it
is
not
the
uniting
of
the
persons
of
his
disciples
into
one
person
or
body
that
jesus
prayed
for
but
he
would
have
them
of
one
mind
and
one
spirit
as
he
and
the
father
are
one
so
also
he
had
no
wish
that
the
person
of
one
of
his
disciples
should
be
crowded
into
that
of
another
and
so
on
until
they
all
became
one

but
as
thou
father
art
in
me
and
i
in
thee
that
is
while
remaining
distinct
as

messiah
would
have
the
mind
or
spirit
of
god
in
his
disciples
as
it
was
in
him
and
as
his
was
in
the
father
that
god
might
be
all

the
father
to
be
honored
as
the
head
and
worshiped
in
the
name
of
the
son

ghost

be
revered
as
the
witness

of
both
the

the
spirit
of
the
son
had
an
existence
with
the
father
before
he
was
born
in
the
flesh
and
indeed
it
was
by
him
and
through
him
under
the
direction
of
the
father
that
the
worlds
were
made
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
such
is
the
simple
doctrine
of
the
godhead
taught
to
the
primitive
saints
by
the
apostles
it
was
implicitly
believed
as
revelation
to
them
upon
the
subject
and
they
were
content
to
allow
the
revelation
to
excite
their
reverence
without
arousing
their
curiosity
to
the
point
where
men
of
finite
minds
attempt
to
grasp
the
infinite
or
circumscribe
god
in
their
understandings
in
a
short
time
however
a
change
came
and
men
sought
to
explain
the
revelation
that
god
had
given
of
himself
by
the
vain
babblings
of
pagan
science
and
that
led
not
only
to
much
contention
within
the
church
but
to
the
adoption
in
the
christian
creed
of
erroneous
ideas
in
respect
of
deity
gnostic
and
new
platonic
in
order
to
give
a
clear
explanation
of
this
matter
it
will
be
necessary
to
invite
the
attention
of
the
student
to
gnosticism
and
the
eclectic
or
new
platonic
philosophy
which
arose
in
the
early
christian
centuries
first
then
as
to
gnosticism
the
gnostics
taught
there
existed
from
eternity
a
being
that
embodied
within
himself
all
the
virtues
a
being
who
is
the
purest
light
and
is
diffused
throughout
boundless
space
which
they
called
pleroma
this
being
after
dwelling
alone
and
in
absolute
repose
for
an
infinite
period
by
an
operation
purely
mental
or
by
acting
upon
himself
produced
two
spirits
of
different
sexes
by
the
marriage
of
these
two
spirits
others
of
similar
nature
were
produced
who
in
their
turn
produced
others
thus
a
celestial
family
was
formed
in
the
pleroma
these
emanations
from
deity
whether
directly
or
from
those
spirits
first
begotten
by
deity
acting
upon
himself
were
called
aeons
a
term
which
was
doubtless
employed
to
signify
their
eternal
duration
and
perhaps
the
mode
of
their
production
beyond
this
pleroma
where
god
and
his
family
dwelt
existed
a
rude
and
unformed
mass
of
matter
heaving
itself
continually
in
wild
commotion
this
mass
of
the
aeons
wandering
beyond
the
pleroma
discovered
and
reduced
to
order
and
beauty
and
then
peopled
it
with
human
beings
and
with
animals
of
different
species
this
builder
of
the
world
the
gnostics
called
the
demiurge
though
possessed
of
many
shining
qualities
the
demiurge
was
by
nature
arrogant
and
domineering
hence
he
claims
absolute
authority
over
the
new
world
to
the
exclusion
altogether
of
the
authority
of
the
supreme
god
and
requires
mankind
to
pay
divine
honors
exclusively
to
him
man
according
to
the
gnostic
philosophy
is
composed
of
a
terrestial
and
therefore
a
vicious
body
and
of
a
celestial
spirit
which
in
some
sense
is
a
particle
of
the
deity
himself
the
spirit
is
oppressed
by
the
body
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
seat
of
all
the
lusts
and
other
evils
that
flesh
is
heir
to
and
by
the
spirit
of
man
is
drawn
away
from
the
knowledge
and
worship
of
the
true
god
and
led
to
pay
reverence
to
the
demiurge
and
his
associates
from
this
wretched
bondage
of
evil
god
labors
to
rescue
his
offspring
but
the
demiurge
and
his
associates
eager
to
retain
their
power
resist
the
divine
purpose
and
labor
to
efface
all
knowledge
of
the
supreme
deity
the
philosophy
maintained
however
that
god
would
ultimately
prevail
and
having
restored
to
liberty
most
of
the
spirits
now
imprisoned
in
bodies
he
will
dissolve
the
fabric
of
the
world
then
the
primitive
tranquility
will
return
and
god
will
reign
with
the
redeemed
spirits
in
perfect
happiness
to
all
eternity
when
the
followers
of
this
philosophy
became
converted
to
christianity
they
looked
upon
jesus
christ
and
the
holy
ghost
as
the
latest
aeons
or
emanations
from
the
deity
sent
forth
to
emancipate
men
from
the
tyranny
of
matter
by
revealing
to
them
the
true
god
to
fit
them
though
perfect
knowledge
to
enter
the
sacred
pleroma
in
connection
with
this
however
some
of
these
christian
gnostics
held
that
jesus
had
no
body
at
all
but
was
an
unsubstantial
phantom
that
constantly
deceived
the
senses
of
those
who
thought
they
associated
with
him
others
of
them
said
there
doubtless
was
a
man
called
jesus
born
of
human
parents
upon
whom
one
of
the
aeons
called
christ
descended
at
his
baptism
having
quitted
the
pleroma
for
that
purpose
but
who
previous
to
the
crucifixion
of
the
man
jesus
withdrew
from
him
and
returned
to
the
deity

end
of

the
two
modes
of
life
to
which
gnosticism
the
gnostic
philosophy
led
to
two
widely
different
methods
of
life
one
extremely
ascetic
and
the
other
as
extremely
profligate
gnostics
believed
matter
to
be
utterly
malignant
the
source
of
all
evil
therefore
it
was
recommended
by
one
party
that
the
body
should
be
weakened
by
fastings
and
the
practice
of
other
austerities
that
the
spirit
might
enjoy
the
greater
liberty
and
be
better
able
to
contemplate
heavenly
things
the
other
party
on
the
contrary
maintained
that
men
could
safely
indulge
all
their
appetites
and
lustful
desires
and
that
there
was
no
moral
difference
in
human
actions
one
leader
of
this
persuasion
carpocrates
of
alexandria
who
flourished
in
the
second
century
not
only
gave
his
disciples
license
to
sin
but
imposed
on
them
the
necessity
of
sinning
by
teaching
them
the
way
to
eternal
salvation
was
open
to
those
souls
only
which
committed
all
kinds
of
enormity
and
wickedness
such
were
the
errors
that
grew
out
of
gnosticism
and
which
contributed
to
the
corruption
of
the
gospel
soon
after
it
was
founded
by
the
preaching
of
the
apostles
the
new
platonic
the
eclectic
or
new
platonic
philosophy
which
came
into
existence
in
the
early
christian
centuries
was
compounded
from
all
the
systems
which
had
preceded
it
though
following
plato
more
closely
than
any
other
teacher
for
which
reason
its
disciples
assumed
the
name
of
new
platonics
the
founders
of
this
philosophy
professed
simply
to
follow
truth
gathering
up
whatever
was
accordant
with
it
regardless
of
its
source
or
in
what
school
it
was
taught
hence
the
name
eclectic
still
the
teachings
of
plato
formed
the
basis
of
their
doctrines
and
they
embraced
most
of
his
dogmas
concerning
god
the
human
soul
and
the
universe
we
shall
therefore
learn
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
eclectics
by
considering
what
the
athenian
sage
taught
on
these
subjects
plato
held
that
god
and
matter
existed
from
all
eternity
that
they
were
before
the
creation
of
the
world
matter
had
in
itself
a
principle
of
motion
but
without
end
or
laws
this
principle
of
motion
plato
called
the
immortal
soul
of
the
universe
god
wished
to
give
form
to
this
mass
of
eternal
matter
regulate
its
motion
subject
it
to
some
end
and
to
certain
laws
everything
which
exists
in
heaven
or
in
earth
except
deity
and
unorganized
matter
according
to
plato
philosophy
had
a
beginning
there
was
a
time
when
it
did
not
exist
but
there
never
was
a
time
when
the
idea
that
is
the
form
or
plan
of
the
thing
did
not
exist
in
the
mind
of
deity
this
idea
or
intelligence
existing
with
god
from
all
eternity
is
what
plato
called
the
logos
the
word
or
intelligence
of
deity
many
in
the
age
of
which
we
write
saw
in
these
doctrines
a
threefold
expression
of
the
divine
nature
the
first
cause
the
reason
or
logos
and
the
spirit
of
the
universe
while
others
saw
in
these
three
principles
three
gods
united
with
each
other
by
a
mysterious
and
ineffable
generation
in
which
the
logos
is
regarded
in
the
character
of
the
son
of
an
eternal
father
and
the
creator
and
governor
of
the
work

commencing
in

word

the

in

verse
of
his
opening
chapter
declares
was
made
flesh
and
dwelt
among
men
plainly
alluding
to
the
and
birth
of

the
new
platonics
saw
the
incarnation
of
the
logos
of
plato
and
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
times
attempted

to
the
rank
of

in
the

merely
the

substance
under

aspects
the
orthodox
the
view
held
to
be
orthodox
was
that
in
god
there
are
three
persons
father
son
and
holy
spirit
each
really
distinct
yet
so
united
as
to
constitute

substance
and
equal
as
to
their
eternity
power
and
glory
and
all
other
perfections
sabellian
on
one
side
of
this
orthodox
theory
stood
the
doctrine
of
sabellius
who
held
that
there
was
but
one
divine
person
in
the
godhead
and
that
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
were
but
different
aspects
of
the
same
god
and
that
the
trinity
was
one
of
names
merely
not
of
distinct
persons
the
logos
in
hi
theory
is
an
attribute
of
deity
rather
than
a
person
and
its
incarnation
is
reduced
to
an
energy
or
inspiration
of
the
divine
wisdom
which
filled
the
soul
and
directed
all
the
actions
of
the
man
jesus
the
arian
on
the
other
side
of
the
orthodox
line
stood
the
theory
of
arius
who
while
he
maintained
a
real
distinction
in
the
persons
of
the
divine
trinity
taught
that
the
son
was
created
out
of
nothing
by
the
will
of
the
father
and
though
the
longest
astronomical
periods
would
not
measure
the
time
of
his
duration
yet
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
was
not
upon
the
son
thus
created
the
father
bestowed
great
glory
yet
he
shone
only
by
a
reflected
light
and
governed
the
universe
only
in
obedience
to
the
will
of
the
father
in
other
words
the
son
was
subordinate
to
the
father
unequal
as
to
eternity
power
and
glory
the
nicene
it
was
to
still
the
rising
commotion
which
arose
in
the
church
through
the
violent
discussion
of
these
several
theories
that
the
emperor
constantine
assembled
the
council
of
nice
nes
in
that
council
the
theories
of
arius
were
condemned
and
the
orthodox
creed
stated
thus
we
believe
in
one
god
the
father
almighty
the
maker
of
all
things
visible
and
invisible
and
in
one
lord
jesus
christ
the
son
of

whom
all

those
who
say
there
was
a
time
when
he
the
son
was
not
and
that
he
was
not
before
he
was
begotten
and
that
he
was
made
out
of
nothing
or
affirm
that
he
is
of
any
other
substance
or
essence
of
that
the
son
of
god
was
created
and
mutable
or
changeable
the
catholic
church
doth
pronounce
accursed
athanasius
who
was
the
most
active
opponent
of
arius
thus
explains
the
nicene
doctrine
in
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
creed
of
athanasius
we
worship
one
god
in
trinity
and
trinity
and
unity
neither
confounding
the
persons
nor
dividing

for
there
is
one
person
of
the

another

another
of

the

the

the
son
eternal
and

and
yet
these
are
not
three
eternals
but
one
eternal
as
also
there
are
not
three
incomprehensibles
nor
three
uncreated
but
one
uncreated
and

incomprehensible
so
likewise
the

is
almighty
the
son
almighty
and
the
holy
ghost
almighty
and
yet
they
are
not

almighties

the

is

the

god
everlasting
without
body
parts
or
passions
of
infinite
power
wisdom
and
goodness
etc
this
plainly
teaches
the
great
error
of
the
immateriality
of
god
and
indeed
that
is
the
orthodox
notion
in
respect
to
deity
notwithstanding
it
finds
so
many
express
contradictions
in
the
scriptures
in
the
work
of
creation
god
proposed
to
make
man
in
his
own
image
and
likeness
and
the
proposition
was
executed
moreover
jesus
is
said
to
be
the
brightness
of
god
glory
and
the
express
image
of
his
person
again
it
is
said
that
jesus
being
in
the
form
of
god
thought
it
not
robbery
to
be
equal
with
god
all
this
teaches
that
god
has
a
form
similar
to
that
of
man
that
he
has
organs
dimensions
proportions
that
he
occupies
space
and
has
relation
to
other
objects
in
space
that
he
moves
from
place
to
place
and
that
so
far
as
his
actual
person
is
concerned
he
can
not
be
in
two
places
at
one
and
the
same
instant
the
question
here
arises
as
to
those
passages
of
scripture
which
declare
the
omnipresence
of
god
a
thing
which
is
impossible
speaking
of
his
person
if
what
is
here
contended
for
be
true
but
god
may
be
and
is
omnipresent
by
his
influence
by
his
power
if
not
in
his
person
while
his
person
is
confined
to
one
place
at
a
time
as
other
substances
are
his
influence
extends
throughout
the
universe
as
does
also
his
power
and
through
this
means
he
is
omnipotent
and
omnipresent
to
assert
the
immateriality
of
god
is
not
only
to
deny
his
personality
but
his
very
existence
for
an
immaterial
substance
can
not
exist
it
can
have
no
relation
to
time
or
space
no
form
no
extension
no
parts
an
immaterial
substance
is
simply
no
substance
at
all
it
is
a
contradiction
of
terms
to
say
a
substance
is
immaterial
it
is
the
description
of
an
infinite
vacuum
and
the
difference
between
the
atheist
and
the
orthodox
christian
is
one
of
terms
not
of
fact
the
former
says
there
is
no
god
the
latter
in
his

says
god
is
nothing

allowed

give

the

itself

both
what
precedes

place
beyond

he
allowed
them
at

sepulchres
of

on

to
dance
to
use

to

hoping
that

they
would

deadly

all
of

have
been
introduced
into

by
the
wickedness
of

the

of

are
bestowed
to

curses
therefore
as
long

the

are
needed

would

were
common

for
more
than
two

three
centuries
we
seldom
hear
of
them
after
that
fatal
period
when
the
emperor
constantine
called
himself
a
christian

from
a
vain
imagination
of
promoting
the
christian
cause
thereby
heaped
riches

honor
upon
christians
in
general

in

upon
the
christian
clergy
from
this
time
they
the
spiritual
gifts
almost
totally
ceased
very
few
instances
of
the
kind
were
found
the
cause
of
this
was
not
as
has
been
supposed
because
there
was
no
more
occasion
for
them
because
all
the
world
was
become
christians
this
is
a
miserable
mistake
not
a
twentieth
part
of
it
was
then
nominally
christian
the
real
cause
of
it
was
the
love
of
many
almost
all
christians
was
waxed
cold
the
christians
had
no
more
of
the
spirit
of
christ
than
the
other
heathens
the
son
of
man
when
he
came
to
examine
his
church
could
hardly
find
faith
upon
the
earth
this
was
the
real
cause
why
the
extraordinary
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
were
no
longer
to
be
found
in
the
christian
church

neither

could
make

only
a

because
the

is
impossible
the

who
wished
to
excel
in
virtue
they
considered
many
things
forbidden
to
them
which
were
proper
for
ordinary
christians
to
indulge
in
such
as
wine
flesh
matrimony
and
secular
business
they
thought
the
holiness
of
life
they
aspired
to
could
sooner
be
attained
by
emaciating
the
body
by
fastings
watchings
excessive
toil
hunger
insufficient
and
coarse
raiment
in
short
they
thought
to
merit
heaven
by
making
earth
a
hell
those
who
engaged
in
this
kind
of
life
soom
came
to
distinguish
themselves
by
their
dress
as
well
as
by
the
austerity
of
their
lives
they
soon
began
to
withdraw
themselves
from
association
with
their
fellow
christians
and
the
world
and
retire
to
the
deserts
and
the
wilderness
where
by
severe
meditation
they
sought
to
abstract
their
minds
from
external
objects
and
those
things
which
minister
to
sensual
delights
they
sometimes
lived
alone
but
oftener
in
association
with
those
devoted
to
the
same
manner
of
life
when
peace
was
assured
to
the
christian
church
early
in
the
fourth
century
the
number
of
those
who
became
ambitious
for
this
austere
righteousness
greatly
increased
until
vast
multitudes
of
monk
and
sacred
virgins
spread
with
remarkable
rapidity
throughout
christendom
about
the
year
the
practice
of
collecting
these
people
into
associated
communities
and
regulating
their
mode
of
living
by
fixed
rules
was
introduced
st
anthony
of
egypt
was
the
prime
mover
in
this
work
thus
monasteries
and
nunneries
were
established
and
in
a
short
time
the
east
especially
swarmed
with
persons
who
abandoned
the
conveniences
associations
and
business
of
ordinary
life
to
pine
away
in
these
institutions
and
hardships
and
sufferings
in
order
to
attain
a
closer
communion
with
god
and
a
more
excellent
salvation
origin
of
the
false
idea
of
moral
the
christian
church
would
have
remained
free
from
these
numerous
tortures
of
the
mond
and
body
remarks
mosheim
had
not
that
great
and
fascinating
doctrine
of
the
ancient
philosophy
gained
credence
among
christians
that
to
attain
to
happiness
and
communion
with
god
the
soul
must
be
freed
from
the
influence
of
the
body
and
for
this
purpose
the
body
must
be
subdued
as
a
further
evidence
that
these
false
notions
of
life
and
virtue
came
from
the
pagan
philosophy
rather
than
from
the
christian
religion
we
quote
again
from
mosheim
the
causes
of
this
institution
austere
method
of
life
are
at
hand
first
the
christians
did
not
like
to
appear
inferior
to
the
greeks
the
romans
and
the
other
people
among
whom
were
many
philosophers
and
sages
who
were
distinguished
from
the
vulgar
by
their
dress
and
their
whole
mode
of
life
and
who
were
held
in
high
honor
now
among
these
philosopher
as
is
well
known
none
better
pleased
the
christians
than
the
platonists
and
pythagoreans
who
are
known
to
have
recommended
two
modes
of
living
the
one
for
philosophers
who
wished
to
excel
in
virtue
and
the
other
for
the
people
engaged
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
the
platonists
prescribed
the
following
rules
for
philosophers
the
mind
of
a
wise
man
must
be
withdrawn
as
far
as
possible
from
the
contagious
influence
of
the
body
and
as
the
oppressive
load
of
the
body
and
social
intercourse
are
most
adverse
to
this
design
therefore
all
sensual
gratifications
are
to
be
avoided
the
body
is
to
be
sustained
or
rather
mortified
with
coarse
and
slender
fare
solitude
is
to
be
sought
for
and
the
mind
is
to
be
and
absorbed
in
contemplation
so
as
to
be
detached
as
much
as
possible
from
the
body
whoever
lives
in
this
manner
shall
in
the
present
life
have
converse
with
god
and
when
freed
from
the
load
of
the
body
shall
ascend
without
delay
to
the
celestial
mansions
and
shall
not
need
like
the
souls
of
other
men
to
undergo
purgation
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
christians
adopted
the
pagan
philosophy
of
which
the
teachings
of
plato
were
the
basis
and
employed
it
to
explain
the
christian
religion
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
they
adopted
its
moral
precepts
and
by
so
doing
corrupted
that
reasonable
and
healthy
moral
life
enjoined
upon
all
alike
in
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
celibacy
of
the
from
the
same
source
came
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
it
was
considered
that
those
who
lived
in
wedlock
were
more
subject
to
the
assaults
of
evil
spirits
than
those
who
lived
in
celibacy
hence
those
who
were
appointed
to
teach
and
govern
others
were
supposed
to
be
all
the
better
qualified
for
their
work
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
conjugal
life
it
was
a
matter
however
which
during
the
first
centuries
was
not
strictly
enjoined
by
any
formal
regulations
of
the
church
it
was
left
for
pope
gregory
vii
in
the
eleventh
century
to
bind
such
a
wicked
regulation
upon
the
clergy
by
express
law
in
the
third
century
the
most
shameful
abuses
arose
out
of
this
doctrine
for
men
sought
to
fulfill
its
requirements
with
the
least
violence
to
their
inclinations
and
many
of
those
who
had
taken
upon
themselves
vows
of
chastity
took
to
their
houses
and
even
to
their
beds
some
one
of
those
holy
females
under
like
vows
of
chastity
yet
maintained
that
there
was
no
improper
relations
between
them
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
many
bishops
condemned
this
shameful
practice
but
it
was
some
time
before
the
church
was
rid
of
it
and
the
scandal
it
created
and
even
when
such
practices
did
cease
openly
it
may
well
be
doubted
if
it
really
ceased
among
those
forced
into
such
unnatural
conditions
deceiving
and
lying
accounted
another
evil
which
went
far
toward
corrupting
the
church
was
the
idea
that
to
deceive
and
lie
are
virtues
when
religion
can
be
promoted
by
them
this
pernicious
doctrine
was
accepted
early
in
the
first
centuries
and
it
accounts
for
the
existence
and
circulation
of
that
great
mass
of
childish
fable
and
falsehood
respecting
the
infancy
and
youth
of
messiah
and
the
miraculous
power
of
the
relics
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
from
which
the
cause
of
the
christian
religion
has
suffered
so
much
if
some
inquisitive
person
were
to
examine
the
conduct
and
the
writings
of
the
greatest
and
most
pious
teachers
of
this
century
the
fourth
writes
mosheim
i
fear
he
would
find
about
all
of
them
infected
with
this
leprosy
i
can
not
except
ambrose
nor
hilary
nor
augustine
nor
gregory
nazianzen
nor
jerome
immoral
condition
of
the
church
in
the
wickedness
of
the
clergy
in
the
last
centuries
the
ambition
of
the
bishops
and
their
imitating
in
their
lives
the
voluptuousness
of
princes
we
have
already
noted
in
section
four
of
part
ii
and
therefore
little
need
be
said
here
further
than
to
remark
that
those
vices
very
rapidly
increased
as
time
rolled
on
worldly
prosperity
seemed
to
relax
the
nerves
of
discipline
fraud
envy
and
malice
prevailed
in
every
congregation
the
presbyters
aspired
to
the
episcopal
office
which
every
day
became
an
object
more
worthy
their
ambition
the
bishops
who
contended
with
each
other
for
ecclesiastical
appeared
by
their
conduct
to
claim
a
secular
and
tyrannical
power
in
the
church
and
the
lively
faith
which
still
distinguished
the
christians
from
the
gentiles
was
shown
much
less
in
their
lives
than
in
their
controversial
writings
sometimes
these
struggles
for
place
and
power
resulted
in
war
and
bloodshed
such
was
the
case
in
the
fourth
century
when
a
new
pope
was
to
be
elected
to
succeed
liberius
one
party
in
rome
was
for
one
damasus
and
another
party
for
ursicinus
the
contest
resulted
in
a
bloody
conflict
houses
were
burned
and
many
lost
their
lives
in
one
church
alone
one
morning
after
the
conflict
there
were
found
one
hundred
and
corpses
to
bear
witness
to
the
violence
of
the
struggle
for
what
was
claimed
to
be
the
office
of
viceregent
of
god
on
earth
moral
condition
of
the
church
in
the
fourth
in
the
fourth
century
if
we
look
at
the
lives
and
morals
of
the
christians
we
shal
find
as
heretofore
that
good
men
were
commingled
with
bad
yet
the
number
of
the
bad
began
gradually
to
increase
so
that
the
truly
pious
and
godly
appeared
more
rare
when
there
was
no
more
to
fear
from
enemies
from
without
when
the
character
of
most
bishops
was
tarnished
with
arrogance
luxury
effeminacy
animosity
resentments
and
other
defects
when
the
lower
clergy
neglected
their
proper
duties
and
were
more
attentive
to
controversies
than
to
the
promotion
of
piety
and
the
instruction
of
the
people
when
vast
numbers
were
induced
not
by
a
rational
conviction
but
by
the
fear
of
punishment
and
the
hope
of
worldly
advantage
to
enroll
themselves
as
christians
how
can
it
surprise
us
that
on
all
sides
the
vicious
appeared
a
host
and
the
pious
a
little
band
almost
overpowered
by
them
against
the
flagitious
and
those
guilty
of
heinous
offenses
the
same
rules
for
penance
were
prescribed
as
before
the
reign
of
constantine
but
as
the
times
continually
waxed
worse
and
worse
the
more
honorable
and
powerful
could
sin
with
impunity
and
only
the
poor
and
the
unfortunate
felt
the
severity
of
the
laws
moral
condition
of
the
church
in
the
fifth
about
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
we
have
salvian
saying
the
very
church
which
should
be
the
body
to
appease
the
anger
of
god
alas
what
reigns
there
but
disorders
calculated
to
incense
the
most
high
it
is
more
common
to
meet
with
christians
who
are
guilty
of
the
greatest
abominations
than
with
those
who
are
wholly
exempt
from
crime
so
that
today
it
is
a
sort
of
sanctity
among
us
to
be
less
vicious
than
the
generality
of
christians
we
insult
the
majesty
of
the
most
high
at
the
foot
of
his
altars
men
the
most
steeped
in
crime
enter
the
holy
places
without
respect
for
them
true
all
men
ought
to
pay
their
vows
to
god
but
why
should
they
seek
his
temples
to
propitiate
him
only
to
go
forth
to
provoke
him
why
enter
the
church
to
deplore
their
former
sins
and
upon
going
forth
what
do
i
say
in
those
very
courts
the
commit
fresh
sins
their
mouths
and
their
hearts
contradict
one
another
their
prayers
are
criminal
meditations
rather
than
vows
of
expiation
scarcely
is
the
service
ended
before
each
returns
to
his
old
practices
some
go
to
their
wine
others
to
their
impurities
still
others
to
robbing
and
brigandage
so
that
we
can
not
doubt
that
these
things
had
been
occupying
them
while
they
were
in
the
church
nor
is
it
the
lowest
of
the
people
who
are
thus
guilty
there
is
no
rank
whatever
in
the
church
which
does
not
commit
all
sorts
of
crimes
it
may
be
urged
that
we
are
at
heart
better
than
the
barbarians
who
oppose
us
suppose
this
to
be
granted
we
ought
to
be
better
than
they
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
more
virtuous
than
we
the
mass
of
christians
are
below
the
barbarians
in
probity
true
all
kinds
of
sins
are
found
among
them
but
what
one
is
not
found
among
us
the
several
nations
have
their
peculiar
sin
the
saxons
are
cruel
the
franks
perfidious
the
gepidae
inhuman
the
huns
lewd
but
we
having
the
law
of
god
to
restrain
us
are
given
over
to
all
these
offenses
then
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
single
sin
of
swearing
can
many
be
found
among
the
faithful
who
have
not
the
name
of
jesus
christ
constantly
upon
their
lips
in
support
of
their
perjuries
this
practice
coming
down
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
classes
has
so
prevailed
that
christians
might
be
deemed
pagans
this
although
the
law
of
god
expressly
forbids
to
take
his
name
in
vain
we
read
this
law
but
we
do
not
practice
it
as
a
consequence
the
pagans
taunt
us
that
we
boast
ourselves
the
sole
possessors
of
god
law
and
of
the
rules
of
truth
and
of
what
that
law
enjoins
christians
indeed
to
the
shame
of
jesus
christ
say
they
in
book
vi
on
providence
of
salvian
continues
his
arraignment
we
rush
from
the
churches
to
the
theatres
even
in
the
midst
of
our
perils
in
carthage
the
theatres
were
thronged
while
the
enemy
were
before
the
walls
and
the
cries
of
those
perishing
outside
under
the
sword
mingled
with
the
shouts
of
the
spectators
in
the
circus
nor
are

it

no
better
in

the
eighth
indeed
the
concurrent
testimony
of

authorities
is
to
the
effect
that

grew

mosheim

the
ungodly
lives
of
most
of
those
intrusted
with
the
care
and

of

a
subject
of
complaint
with
all
the
ingenuous

writers
of

designs

round

indulged
themselves

species
of

had

founding
of

by
messiah
and
to
trace
the
goodness

taking

by

says
the
famous
annalist
of
the
roman
church
whose
partiality
to
the
see
of
rome
is
notorious
has
however
the
candor
to
own
that
this
the
tenth
century
was
an
iron
age
barren
of
all
goodness
a
leaden
age
abounding
in
all
wickedness
and
a
dark
age
remarkable
above
all
other
things
for
the
scarcity
of
writers
and
men
of
learning
christ
was
then
as
it
appears
in
a
very
deep
sleep
when
the
ship
was
covered
with

what
seemed
worse
when
the
lord
was
thus
asleep
there
were

wake

themselves
all

asleep

allusion
by
no

incongruous
with
the
oriental
abd
scriptural
taste
this
writer
baronius
represents
the
divine
head
of
the
church
as
having
given
up
the
church
for
its
wickedness
to
a
judicial
impenitency
which
continued
the
longer
because
there
was
scarcely
any
zealous
spirits
who
had
the
charity
to
pray
for
the
cause

infidel
malice
has
with
pleasure
recorded
the
vices
and

crimes
of

popes
of

century
nor
is
it
my
intention
to
attempt
to
palliate
the
account
of
their
wickedness
it
was
as
deep
and
atrocious
as
language
can
paint
nor
can

reasonable
man
desire
more
authentic
evidence
of

that

we
have
considered
those
events
that
occurred
in
the
church
by
which
its
form
and
spirit
of
government
were
altered
its
doctrines
corrupted
its
ordinances
changed
and
its
truths
and
powers
subverted
we
now
turn
to
the
scriptures
to
show
that
all
these
things
were
predicted
by
the
apostles
and
prophets
of
god
being
foreseen
by
the
spirit
of
revelation
false
teachers
to
arise
in
the
on
the
occasion
of
paul
last
visit
to
ephesus
he
had
the
elders
assembled
and
in
the
course
of
his
address
to
them
said
i
have
not
shunned
to
declare
unto
you
all
the
counsel
of
god
taken
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves
and
to
all
the
flock
over
which
the
holy
ghost
hath
made
you
overseers
to
feed
the
church
of
god
which
he
hath
purchased
with
his
own
blood
for
i
know
this
that
after
my
departing
shall
grievous
wolves
enter
in
among
you
not
sparing
the
flock
also
of
your
own
selves
shall
men
arise
speaking
perverse
things
to
lead
away
disciples
after
them
in
his
second
letter
to
timothy
the
same
apostle
again
prophesies
of
the
coming
of
these
false
teachers
i
charge
thee
therfore
said
he
before
god
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
at
his
appearing
and
his
kingdom
preach
the
word
be
instant
in
season
out
of
season
reprove
rebuke
with
all
long
suffering
and
doctrine
for
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
not
endure
sound
doctrine
but
after
their
own
lusts
shall
they
heap
to
themselves
teachers
having
itching
ears
and
they
the
false
teachers
shall
turn
their
ears
from
the
truth
and
shall
be
turned
unto
fables
peter
also
prophesied
the
rise
of
false
teachers
in
the
church
in
his
second
epistle
addressed
to
them
that
have
obtained
like
precious
faith
with
himself
that
is
to
the
saints
after
saying
that
prophecy
in
olden
time
came
by
men
speaking
as
they
were
moved
upon
by
the
holy
ghost
he
then
remarks
but
there
were
false
prophets
also
among
the
people
that
is
among
the
ancient
saints
even
as
there
shall
be
false
teachers
among
you
who
privily
shall
bring
in
damnable
heresies
even
denying
the
lord
that
bought
them
and
bring
upon
themselves
swift
destruction
and
many
shall
follow
their
pernicious
ways
by
reason
of
whom
the
way
of
truth
shall
be
evil
spoken
of
and
through
covetousness
with
feigned
words
make
merchandise
of
you
whose
judgment
now
of
a
long
time
lingereth
not
and
their
damnation
slumbereth
not
hypocrisy
and
austerity
paul
also
appears
to
have
foreseen
the
hypocrisy
that
would
creep
into
the
church
together
with
that
useless
austerity
of
life
with
which
men
and
women
would
become
infatuated
and
which
became
the
fountain
of
so
much
corruption
he
thus
speaks
of
it
now
the
spirit
speaketh
expressly
that
in
the
latter
times
some
shall
depart
from
the
faith
giving
heed
to
seducing
spirits
and
doctrines
of
devils
speaking
lies
in
hypocrisy
having
their
conscience
seared
with
a
hot
iron
forbidding
to
marry
and
commanding
to
abstain
from
meats
the
rise
of
moreover
the
prophet
paul
foretold
the
rise
of
before
the
glorious
coming
of
messiah
to
judgment
he
plainly
foresaw
the
falling
away
the
long
night
of
spiritual
darkness
and
apostasy
that
would
brood
over
the
world
before
the
coming
of
the
son
of
god
in
the
glory
of
his
father
to
reward
the
righteous
to
condemn
the
wicked
he
said
of
this
apostasy
now
we
beseech
you
brethren
by
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
by
our
gathering
together
unto
him
that
ye
be
not
soon
shaken
in
mind
or
be
troubled
neither
by
spirit
nor
by
word
nor
by
letter
as
from
us
as
that
the
day
of
christ
is
at
hand
let
no
man
deceive
you
by
any
means
for
that
day
shall
not
come
except
there
come
a
falling
away
first
and
that
man
of
sin
be
revealed
the
son
of
perdition
who
opposeth
and
exalteth
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
or
that
is
worshiped
so
that
he
as
god
sitteth
in
the
temple
of
god
showing
himself
that
he
is
god
remember
ye
not
that
when
i
was
yet
with
you
i
told
you
these
things
and
now
ye
know
what
withholdeth
that
he
might
be
revealed
in
his
own
time
for
the
mystery
of
iniquity
doth
already
work
only
he
who
now
letteth
hindereth
will
let
will
hinder
until
he
be
taken
out
of
the
way
and
then
shall
that
wicked
be
revealed
whom
the
lord
shall
consume
with
the
spirit
of
his
mouth
and
shall
destroy
with
the
brightness
of
his
coming
even
him
whose
coming
is
after
the
working
of
satan
with
all
power
and
signs
and
lying
wonders
and
with
all
deceivableness
of
unrighteousness
in
them
that
perish
because
they
received
not
the
love
of
the
truth
that
they
might
be
saved
and
for
this
cause
god
shall
send
them
strong
delusions
that
they
should
believe
a
lie
that
they
all
might
be
damned
who
believe
not
the
truth
but
had
pleasure
in
unrighteousness
isaiah
great
prophecy
of
the
isaiah
also
prophesied
of
the
universal
apostasy
from
the
gospel
of
christ
after
describing
the
earth
as
mourning
and
fading
away
together
with
its
haughty
people
he
said
the
earth
also
is
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof
because
they
have
transgressed
the
laws
changed
the
ordinance
broken
the
everlasting
covenant
therefore
hath
the
curse
devoured
the
earth
and
they
that
dwell
therein
are
desolate
therefore
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
burned
and
few
men
left
it
is
sometimes
claimed
that
this
prophecy
refers
to
the
mosaic
law
and
the
mosaic
covenant
instead
of
the
gospel
of
christ
the
answer
to
such
claim
is
that
the
prophecy
has
reference
to
an
everlasting
covenant
that
is
to
be
broken
and
the
mosaic
law
or
covenant
never
was
intended
to
be
an
everlasting
covenant
while
the
gospel
of
christ
is
such
a
covenant
paul
said
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
preached
before
the
gospel
to
abraham
wherefore
then
serveth
the
law
that
is
if
the
gospel
was
preached
unto
abraham
of
what
use
is
the
law
of
moses
the
law
of
carnal
commandments
how
came
it
into
existence
it
was
added
because
of
transgression
till
the
seed
christ
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made
wherefore
the
law
was
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
unto
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
but
after
that
faith
is
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
schoolmaster
from
this
it
appears
that
the
gospel
was
preached
in
very
ancient
times
that
afterwards
because
of
transgression
doubtless
apostasy
the
law
of
moses
was
added
or
given
in
the
place
of
the
gospel
that
it
might
act
as
a
schoolmaster
to
bring
the
people
to
christ
that
is
prepare
them
for
the
gospel
therefore
when
the
gospel
was
introduced
by
the
personal
ministry
of
messiah
the
law
of
moses
the
carnal
law
having
served
its
purpose
was
set
aside
and
the
gospel
was
reinstated
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
the
mosaic
law
was
not
an
everlasting
covenant
but
a
temporary
law
given
for
a
specific
purpose
having
accomplished
which
it
is
supplanted
by
a
more
excellent
law
and
covenant
it
is
clear
that
isaiah
great
prophecy
had
no
reference
to
the
law
of
moses
but
to
an
everlasting
covenant
which
was
to
be
broken
its
ordinance
changed
its
laws
transgressed
that
covenant
is
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
whose
blood
is
spoken
of
as
the
blood
of
the
everlasting
covenant
moreover
the
prophecy
ends
by
saying
that
in
consequence
of
the
transgression
of
the
law
the
changing
of
the
ordinance
the
breaking
of
the
covenant
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
burned
and
few
men
left
this
predicted
calamity
did
not
overtake
the
people
for
breaking
the
mosaic
law
it
has
not
yet
taken
place
it
is
a
judgment
still
hanging
over
mankind
for
their
great
apostasy
from
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
john
vision
foreshadowing
the
among
the
many
revelations
given
to
the
apostle
john
while
a
prisoner
on
the
isle
of
patmos
was
one
in
which
he
saw
an
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
to
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
saying
with
a
loud
voice
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment
is
come
and
worship
him
that
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
fountains
of
waters
from
this
it
is
learned
that
in
the
hour
of
god
judgment
the
gospel
will
be
brought
to
the
earth
by
an
angel
and
thence
proclaimed
to
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
a
very
good
evidence
that
in
the
hour
of
god
judgment
all
the
world
would
be
without
the
gospel
or
why
this
restoration
at
that
time
and
its
universal
proclamation
if
the
nations
at
the
time
indicated
already
possessed
it
thus
through
revelation
the
ancient
prophets
foresaw
the
great
apostasy
from
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
we
who
live
now
after
the
great
event
has
occurred
in
the
light
of
historical
facts
see
it
no
more
plainly
than
did
these
ancient
servants
of
god
through
the
gift
of
prophecy
they
read
the
history
of
it
by
the
light
of

we
by

and
the
former
is
a
light
no
less
certain
than
the
latter
review
by
what
means
were
the

and
still
more
ancient
prophets
made
acquainted
with
the
great
apostasy
from

christian
religion
repeat
the
several
prophecies

you

the
objection
what
great

wicked
apostasy
what

viii
the
nephite
christian
for
nearly
two
centuries
the
nephite
christian
church
flourished
in
great
prosperity
for
that
length
of
time
the
truth
seems
to
have
been
preserved
in
its
fullness
and
the
church
in
its
unity
with
the
third
century
however
began
that
apostasy
which
eventually
terminated
by
a
complete
subversion
of
the
church
of
christ
on
the
western
hemisphere
pride
of
wealth
and
class
the
peace
and
righteousness
of
two
centuries
brought
great
prosperity
and
wealth
to
the
nephite
christians
to
the
entire
western
hemisphere
but
the
commencement
of
the
third

began
to
develop
the
fact
that
pride
was
pressing
fast
upon
the
heels
of
that
prosperity
up
to
the
commencement
of
the
third

the

christians
had
all
things
common

early
in
the
third
century
that
order
of
things
was
broken
up

arose
men
began
to
pride
themselves
on

jewels
they
began
to
build
churches
to
get
gain
and
to
deny
the
true
church
of

others
professing
to
be
christians
denied
much
of
that
which
messiah
taught
and

jesus
selected
from

three
desired
that

might
remain
upon

messiah
should
come
in

this

was

them

of

they

do
not

our

was

took
upon
him
both

the
antiquity

the
idea

that
proves
as

that
the

is
true

those

taught

the
appeal
had
no
other
significance
than
that
clement
the
third
bishop
of
rome
is
my
authority
for
the
above
statement
it
appears
that
the
corinthians
had
deposed
some
of
their
bishops
and
clement
in
an
epistle
which
he
wrote
to
them
said
our
apostles
knew
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
there
would
be
strife
over
the
name
of
the
bishop
office
for
this
cause
therefore
having
received
complete
foreknowledge
they
appointed
the
aforesaid
persons
the
bishops
and
afterward
they
provided
a
continuance
gave
instructions
that
if
these
should
fall
asleep
other
approved
men
should
succeed
to
their
ministration
those
therefore
who
were
appointed
by
other
men
of
repute
with
the
consent
of
the
whole

ministered
unblamably

mosheim
in

states
that
next
to
the

were
bishops
called

but
this
his
translator
murdock
denies
certain
it
is
however
that
there
were
bishops
who
presided
over
several
provinces
just
as
the
civil
exarchs
did
these
mosheim
may
have
considered
as
corresponding
to
the
civil
exarchs
while
his
translator
insists
that
they
were
merely
the
first
metropolitans
of
the
civil
dioceses
the
difference
seems
to
be
one
of
terms
rather
than
of
facts
but
there
is
this
to
say
in
favor
of
the
translator
that
the
bishops
exercising
jurisdiction
over
several
provinces
did
not
correspond
to
the
number
of
civil
exarchs
there
was
not
an
exarch
bishop
over
each
civil
diocese
and
perhaps
this
is
the
reason
the
learned
translator
objects
to
the
term
of
ecclesiastical
exarch
in

professor
of

states
that
the

with

like
him
without

the
gnostics
desired
to
avoid
making
god
the
author
of
evil
hence
it
is
a
leading
principle
in
their
philosophy
that
all
evil
has
its
origin
in
matter
and
as
matter
was
created
by
one
of

not
by

the
subject
is
difficult

the
following
will
perhaps
aid
the
student
to
grasp
the
sabellian
doctrine

let
us
next
imagine
it
frozen
into

next
as
entirely
dissolved
into

here
we
have
the

substance
in
three
different
aspects
but
whether
we
speak
of
it
as
the
liquid
ocean
the
frozen
ocean
or
the
ocean
dissolved
into
vapor
it
is
always
the
same
ocean
the
same
substance
but
under
different
aspects
whether
he
appeared
as
the
father
the
son
or
the
holy
ghost
he
was
always
the
same
god
such
was
the
sabellian
theory
in
respect
to
deity
mosheim
represents
sabellius
as
teaching
that
the
divine
nature
was
divided
into
portions
that
one
portion
became
separate

called
the
son
and
was

the

was

the
weight

is

how

will
reason
upon
the

in

the

it

the

both
the

is
absolute
nonsense
a
contradiction
in

either
therefore
we
must
affirm
it
to
be

or
we
deny
its
existence
now
apply
that
correct
reasoning
to
the
immaterial
god
of
the
orthodox
christian
and
what
is
the
result
let
us
try
the
experiment
by
substituting
the
word
god
for

it

intellectual
pursuits
became
not
only
a
pleasure
but
a
passion
and
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
maxim
that
wherever
the
progress
of
intelligence
is
a
true
pleasure
a
desire
for
liberty
is
soon
felt
nor
is
it
long
in
passing
from
the
public
mind
to
the
state
it
was
so
in
europe
for
the
revival

there
can
be
no

that
it
did
much
to
produce
that
struggle

in
the

began

released
to
some
extent
from
the
serfdom
of
former
times
and
to
be
given
some
share
of
civil
and
political
freedom
this
change
was
largely
due
to
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
feudal
system
of
land
tenure
and
service
according
to
feudal
principles
all
the
land
of
a
country
belonged
to
the
king
not
as
representing
the
community
but
as
sovereign
feudal
lord
out
of
this
land
the
king
granted
portions
to
his
subjects
on
condition
of
their
paying
him
homage
and
fealty
and
rendering
him
active
military
service
a
certain
number
of
days
in
every
year
the
estates
the
king
granted
to
his
more
immediate
and
distinguished
followers
whom
he
called
his
barons
were
styled
baronies
and
were
of
large
extent
the
barons
in
their
turn
made
undergrants
to
their
own
retainers
on
similar
conditions
to
those
imposed
upon
themselves
by
the
king
the
relation
between
landlord
and
tenant
though
at
first
merely
lifelong
soon
came
to
be
regarded
as
hereditary
the
heir
becoming
entitled
on
the
death
of
the
tenant
to
occupy
his
land
upon
the
same
terms
this
order
of
things
established
a
powerful

aristocracy

the
destruction
of

the
crusades
their
influence
on
feudalism
and
liberty
the
crusades
were
religious
wars
carried
on
in
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
between
the
christian
nations
of
the
west
and
the
mohammedans
of
the
east
it
had
for
ages
been
looked
upon
as
an
act
of
piety
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
palestine
and
visit
the
various
places
hallowed
by
the
presence
of
messiah
during
his
earthly
career
especially
his
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
these
christian
pilgrims
had
been
respected
by

saracens
for
centuries
but
when
the
seljuk
turks
captured
jerusalem
towards
the
close
of

eleventh

the
christians
met
with
insult

cruelty
the
western

fervent

to
the
distant
east
the
barons
had
to
sell
their

which
had
the
effect
of
breaking
down
to
a
very
great
extent
the
feudal
system
of
land
tenure
and
with
it
the
obligations
that
it
imposed
the
direct
result
of
this
was
to
enlarge
the
liberties
of
the
people
for
the
same
purpose
to
raise

for
carrying

political
privileges
a
circumstance
which
also
contributed
vastly
to

progress

thus
the
way
was
prepared
for
that
religious
revolution
of
the
sixteenth
century
known
in
history
as
the
reformation
martin
the
reformation
is
usually
considered
to
have
begun
with
the
fearless
preaching
of
martin
luther
against
the
sale
of
indulgences
luther
was
born
at
eisleben
germany
his
father
was
a
miner
of
mansfield
in
the
same
country
after
attending
the
school
of
magdeburg
and
eisenach
he
was
sent
to
study
philosophy
and
jurisprudence
at
erfurt
much
against
the
will
of
his
father
he
abandoned
the
pursuit
of
these
studies
and
joined
himself
to
the
augustine
eremites
a
rigid
order
of
mendicant
monks
his
good
temper
industry
and
abilities
won
for
him
the
good
opinions
of
his
superiors
in
he
was
sent
by
his
to
be
professor
of
philosophy
at
wittemburg
while
here
he
applied
himself
to
biblical
theology
and
soon
discovered
a
wide
discrepancy
between
the
religion
of
the
scriptures
and
that
of
the
church
two
years
after
becoming
a
professor
at
wittemburg
he
made
a
journey
to
rome
on
some
business
connected
with
the
augustine
order
of
monks
and
was
not
a
little
shocked
at
the
corruption
and
depravity
of
the
italian
clergy
that
visit
to
rome
did
much
to
dispel
the
veneration
in
which
he
had
held
the
holy
see
and
armed
him
for
his
subsequent
conflict
with
it

their

which
provoked
luther
opposition
to
the
church
of
rome
was
the
reckless
sale
of
indulgences
by
the
agents
of
the
pope
in
germany
the
origin
of
indulgences
according
to
the
learned
schlegel
must
be
sought
in
the
earliest
history
of
the
church
in
the
first
centuries
of
the
christian
era
such
christians
as
were
excluded
from
the
communion
of
the
church
on
account
of
their
apostasy
in
the
times
of
persecutions
or
on
account
of
other
heinous
sins
had
to
seek
a
restoration
to
fellowship
by
a
public
penance
in
which
they
entreated
the
brethren
to
forgive
them
frequently
standing
before
the
door
of
the
church
clothed
in
the
garb
of
mourning
this
punishment
was
regarded
as
a
sort
of
satisfaction
made
to
the
community
of
saints
and
was
called
by
that
name
in
the
case
of
aged
or
infirm
christians
this
satisfaction
was
sometimes
omitted
and
this
omission
was
called
indulgence
originally
therefore
indulgences
were
merely
the
remission
of
ecclesiastical
punishments
imposed
on
grave
offenders
against
church
laws
it
is
maintained
however
in
the
decretal
of
pope
clement
vi
that
one
drop
of
christ
blood
being
sufficient
to
redeem
the
whole
human
race
the
remaining
quantity
that
was
shed
in
the
garden
and
upon
the
cross
was
left
as
a
legacy
to
the
church
to
be
a
treasure
from
whence
indulgences
were
to
be
drawn
and
administered
by
the
roman
pontiffs
the
doctrine
was
held
that
messiah
had
atoned
for
the
eternal
punishment
of
sins
but
not
for
its
temporary
punishment
the
temporary
punishment
the
catholic
church
divided
into
that
of
the
present
life
and
that
of
the
future
life
or
of
purgatory
it
was
held
that
every
man
who
attained
salvation
must
suffer
the
temporary
punishment
of
his
sins
either
in
the
present
world
or
in
the
flames
of
purgatory
it
was
also
held
that
the
priest
to
whom
a
man
confessed
his
sins
had
the
power
to
adjudge
and
impose
the
necessary
punishment
the
punishment
usually
consisted
of
fastings
pilgrimages
whippings
etc
but
people
of
distinction
and
wealth
were
permitted
to
employ
substitutes
to
receive
this
punishment
and
there
were
monks
ever
ready
to
endure
the
punishment
of
the
transgressor
for
a
consideration
paid
in
money
this
penance
was
finally
changed
to
paying
to
the
church
the
money
instead
of
employing
monks
to
endure
the
punishment
whoever
for
instance
was
bound
to
whip
himself
with
so
many
stripes
each
day
for
several
weeks
might
pay
to
the
church
or
to
the
monastery
a
certain
sum
of
money
or
give
it
a
piece
of
land
and
then
be
released
from
the
penance
as
the
popes
perceived
that
something
might
be
gained
in
this
way
they
assumed
to
themselves
the
right
of
commuting
penances
for
pecuniary
satisfactions
which
every
bishop
had
before
exercised
in
his
own
diocese
at
first
they
released
only
from
the
punishments
of
sin
in
the
present
world
but
in
the
fourteenth
century
they
extended
this
release
also
to
the
punishment
in
purgatory
the
traffic
in
when
such
indulgences
were
to
be
published
the
disposal
of
them
was
commonly
farmed
out
the
papal
court
could
not
always
wait
to
have
the
money
conveyed
from
every
country
of
europe
and
there
were
rich
merchants
at
genoa
milan
venice
and
augsburg
who
purchased
the
indulgences
for
a
particular
province
and
paid
to
the
papal
treasury
handsome
sums
for
them
thus
both
parties
were
benefited
the
pope
came
at
once
into
possession
of
large
sums
of
money
and
the
farmers
did
not
fail
of
a
good
bargain
they
were
careful
to
employ
skillful
hawkers
of
the
indulgences
persons
whose
boldness
and
impudence
bore
due
proportion
to
the
eloquence
with
which
they
imposed
upon
the
simple
people
yet
that
this
traffic
might
have
a
religious
aspect
the
pope
appointed
the
archbishops
of
the
several
provinces
to
be
his
commissioners
who
in
his
name
published
that
indulgences
were
to
be
sold
and
usually
selected
the
persons
to
hawk
them
and
for
this
service
shared
the
profits
with
the
merchants
who
farmed
them

in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
sale
of
indulgences
was
pushed
vigorously
and
became
most
offensive
the
reason
for
resorting
to
this
mode
of
raising
revenue
was
justified
by
the
pope
on
the
plea
of
completing

church

by
julius
ii
john

of
the
boldest
most
eloquent
and
the
most
profligate
of
men
see
note
end
of

his
reckless
preaching
of
these
papal
wares
aroused
the
indignation
of
luther
who
published
propositions
against
the
sale
of
indulgences
in
which
he
even
gently
censured
the
pope
for
permitting
the
people
to
be
diverted
from
christ
the
indifference
of
leo
x
to
the
agitation
in
the
dispute
which
arose
between
luther
and
tetzel
was
looked
upon
at
rome
as
the
wrangle
between
two
monks
luther
was
an
augustine
monk
tetzel
a
dominican
and
it
was
supposed
that
the
former
was
jealous
because
the
dominicans
had
been
preferred
for
this
work
of
selling
indulgences
in
addition
to
assailing
tetzel
luther
wrote
a
protest
to
albert
archbishop
of
mentz
and
magdeburg
and
was
as
surprised
as
he
was
indignant
to
learn
that
the
archbishop
received
of
the
profits
arising
from
this
wretched
traffic
his
assault
upon
tetzel
provoked
a
protracted
controversy
a
war
of
pamphlets
between
himself
and
tetzel
and
his
friends
among
whom
was
john
eckius
a
theologian
of
ingolstadt
the
dispute
on
both
sides
was
more
noted
for
its
warmth
than
for
its
christian
character
at
last
leo
x
was
aroused
from
his
indifference
to
the
controversy
that
had
arisen
in
germany
by
the
emperor
maximilian
i
informing
him
that
the
agitation
was
serious
and
that
germany
was
taking
sides
in
respect
to
it
he
therefore
appointed
cardinal
thomas
cajetan
then
at
the
diet
of
augsburg
to
hear
the
cause
of
luther
the
cardinal
summoned
the
monk
before
him
at
augsburg
in
october
they
had
three
interviews
but
nothing
was
accomplished
towards
reconciliation
as
the
cardinal
treated
luther
imperiously
and
peremptorily
ordered
him
to
submit
his
judgment
to
the
authority
of
the
pope
this
the
reformer
refused
to
do
until
he
was
convinced
of
his
error
and
appealed
from
the
pope
to
the
pope
this
took
the
matter
out
of
the
hands
of
the
cardinal
an
appeal
to
a
general
there
was
a
difference
between
the
reformer
and
the
cardinal
in
their
views
in
respect
to
authorities
appealed
to
the
latter
sought
to
convince
the
former
of
his
errors
by
appealing
to
the
canon
law
and
the
authority
of
lombard
but
luther
refused
to
admit
of
any
proof
except
that
of
the
holy
scripture
and
as
the
cardinal
seems
not
to
have
been
able
to
make
good
his
censure
of
the
reformer
doctrines
by
proofs
from
the
scriptures
luther
appealed
to
the
pope
better
informed
but
leo
x
the
month
following
issued
an
edict
requiring
the
church
to
believe
in
his
power
to
forgive
sins
learning
of
this
luther
promptly
appealed
from
the
pope
to
a
future
council
of
the
whole
church
discussion
on
free
meantime
the
points
of
disagreement
between
the
reformer
and
the
church
of
rome
increased
in
john
eckius
challenged
andrew
carlstadt
a
friend
and
colleague
of
luther
to
a
discussion
on
the
subject
of
free
will
about
which
there
was
a
disagreement
between
the
reformer
and
those
who
thought
with
him
among
whom
was
carlstadt
and
the
adherents
of
the
church
of
rome
in
this
dispute
carlstadt
maintained
and
of
course
his
were
luther
views
that
since
the
fall
the
natural
freedom
of
man
is
not
strong
enough
to
move
him
to
that
which
is
morally
good
or
to
do
the
will
of
god
eckius
on
the
contrary
insisted
that
the
free
will
of
man
produces
good
works
and
not
merely
the
grace
of
god
that
our
free
will
with
divine
grace
in
the
production
of
good
works
and
that
it
depends
on
man
free
power
whether
he
will
give
place
to
the
operations
of
grace
or
will
resist
them
luther
and
after
this
dispute
with
carlstadt
eckius
drew
luther
who
had
been
present
at
the
discussion
on
free
will
into
a
public
debate
on
the
foundation
of
the
authority
of
the
pope
eckius
maintained
the
orthodox
view
that
the
supremacy
of
the
pope
was
founded
on
divine
right
that
he
was
the
successor
of
peter
and
the
vicar
of
christ
luther
allowed
the
superiority
of
the
pope
over
other
bishops
but
based
that
superiority
on
other
grounds
he
could
not
deny
that
the
pontiffs
had
possessed
a
decided
from
age
to
age
and
therefore
he
conceived
it
as
his
duty
not
to
resist
the
powers
that
be
unless
it
had
been
the
will
of
god
he
went
on
to
say
the
pope
could
never
have
attained
so
great
and
durable
a
dominion
the
whole
body
of
the
christians
own
themselves
to
be
under
the
roman
pontiff
this
universal
consent
is
a
consideration
of
the
greatest
weight
the
unity
of
the
church
should
be
preserved
in
everything
that
is
not
directly
contrary
to
the
word
of
god
in
all
these
admissions
however
it
will
be
observed
that
the
reformer
placed
the
supremacy
of
the
pontiffs
on
human
not
divine
right
it
was
based
upon
tradition
upon
human
arrangement
to
the
contention
of
eckius
that
the
expressions
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
evinced
the
supremacy
of
peter
and
his
successors
that
this
was
the
explanation
given
by
the
holy
fathers
luther
replied
that
even
if
all
the
fathers
without
exception
had
understood
the
passages
in
that
sense
he
would
confute
them
by
the
authority
of
paul
and
by
peter
himself
who
said
that
jesus
christ
is
the
only
foundation
and
of
the
church
and
further
if
the
words
thou
art
peter
be
construed
strictly
then
they
must
be
confined
to
the
person
of
peter
and
therefore
the
authority
conveyed
by
them
ceased
when
that
apostle
died
the
dispute
amounted
to
nothing
except
that
it
widened
the
breach
between
the
see
of
rome
and
the
reformer
the
latter
while
preparing
for
his
discussion
with
eckius
had
his
suspicions
aroused
that
the
pope
was
the
very
of
the
new
testament
at
the
conclusion
of
the
debate
george
duke
of
saxony
said
to
the
disputants
privately
whether
the
pope
exists
by
divine
or
by
human
right
he
is
however
the
pope
and
that
remark
doubtless
expressed
the
sentiments
of
the
papist
party
luther
condemned
and
eckius
hastened
to
rome
after
the
discussion
at
leipsic
where
with
the
assistance
of
other
enemies
of
luther
among
them
cardinal
cajetan
he
urged
leo
x
to
condemn
him
and
his
works
this
leo
did
by
issuing
a
bull
in
which
of
his
tenets
were
pronounced
heretical
his
writings
condemned
to
the
flames
and
he
himself
commanded
to
confess
his
faults
within
sixty
days
beg
the
forgiveness
of
the
pope
or
be
excommunicated
from
the
church
this
bull
of
condemnation
luther
burned

the
pontifical
canon

presence
of
a
vast

acknowledged

speech

some
length
he
explained
his
motives
in

thus
concluded

some

frederic
the
wise
elector
of

of

died
he
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
john
frederic
had
ever
been
an
ardent
admirer
of
luther
but
was
extremely
cautions
in
giving
him
any
direct
assistance
john
was
of
a
different
temperament
he
believed
the
principles
which
the
reformer
taught
but
saw
quite
clearly
that
they
must
either
be
abandoned
or
the
authority
of
the
pope
discarded
he
resolved
upon
the
latter
and
taking
matters
in
his
own
hands
determined
to
organize
a
church
altogether
distinct
from
that
of
rome
to
accomplish
this
he
called
upon
luther
and
philip
melancthon
to
draw
up
a
formula
for
public
worship
and
draft
a
form
of
church
government
in
harmony
with
their
principles
fixing
the
salaries
of
the
clergy
defining
their
official
duties
etc
this
the
reformers
gladly
undertook
and
shortly
afterwards
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
other
german
princes
pursue
the
same
course
that
john
had
taken
and
adopt
the
system
of
worship
they
had
formulated
the
rupture
between
the
pope
and
the
this
bold
step
threatened
for
a
time
to
disrupt
the
german
empire
for
the
princes
who
remained
true
to
the
old
religion
openly
consulted
together
upon
the
advisability
of
taking
up
arms
against
the
lutherans
and
the
princes
favoring
the
reformers
met
to
consider
the
necessity
of
forming
an
alliance
to
resist
their
enemies
in
the
midst
of
these
threatening
prospects
an
event
happened
which
was
of
great
advantage
to
the
lutheran
cause
and
prevented
for
the
moment
any
action
against
them
the
emperor
charles

and

clement

became
open
enemies
the
pontiff
fearing
the
increasing
power
of
charles
had
formed
an
alliance
with
francis
i
king
of
france
against
him
this
so
incensed
charles
that
he
abolished
the
authority
of
the
pope
in
spain
made
war
upon
him
in
italy
captured
the
cities
of
rome
besieged
the
pontiff
in
his
castle
of
angelo
and
subjected
him
to
great
indignities
the
diet
at
spire
the
difficulties
between
charles
and
the
pope
were
finally
settled
however
and
a
diet
was
called
at
spire
in
in
which
a
majority
voted
to
deprive
the
princes
of
germany
of
the
right
to
regulate
religious
matters
within
their
respective
territories
a
right
which
a
diet
held
three
years
before
at
spire
had
granted
that
is
such
power
was
granted
pending
the
settlement
of
religious
difficulties
by
a
free
general
council
the
diet
also
declared
all
changes
made
in
the
public
religion
unlawful
this
action
was
considered
a
hardship
by
those
princes
who
had
made
such
changes
and
they
protested
against
the
action
of
the
diet
and
appealed
to
the
emperor
it
was
this
protest
which
gave
to
the
dissenting
princes
and
the
followers
of
luther
generally
the
name
protestants
the
envoys
of
the
dissenting
princes

to
inform
charles
of
the
stand
they
had
taken
in
relation
to
the
religious
controversy
in
germany
were
imprisoned
by
him
a
circumstance
which
threatened
hostility
and
the
protestant
princes
at
once
took
counsel
for
their
safety
and
sought
to
form
closer
alliances
with
each
other
for
mutual
defense
unfortunately
however
the
reformers
of
religion
were
not
united
in
doctrine
and
the
efforts
of
the
princes
at
union
were
rendered
vain
by
the
disputes
of
the

protestant
confession
of

emperor
finally
determined
to
settle
this
religious
controversy
within
his
empire
and
appointed
a
diet
to
be
assembled
at
augsburg
for
that
purpose
in
order
that
the
faith
of
the
protestants
might
be
clearly
set
forth
together
with
their
reasons
for
separation
from
the
roman
church
luther
and
melancthon
at
the
instance
of
the
princes
who
favored
their
doctrines
drew
up
a
confession
of
faith
known
as
the
augsburg
confession
it
consisted
of
articles
of
which
stated
the
doctrines
of
the
reformers
and
the
other
seven
stated
their
reason
for
withdrawing
from
the
roman
church
these
in
brief
were
communion
in
one
kind
by
which
the
sacramental
cup
was
denied
the
laity
imposing
celibacy
on
the
clergy
private
masses
auricular
confession
legendary
traditions
monastic
vows
and
lastly
the
excessive
power
of
the
church
in
respect
to
this
last
abuse
as
these
several
above
things
are
called
they
discriminate
between
civil
and
ecclesiastical
power
and
insist
that
neither
should
infringe
upon
the
domain
of
the
other
the
diet
of
augsburg
assembled
on
the
of
june
and
after
the
confession
of
faith
was
read
to
the
emperor
it
was
signed
by
john
elector
of
saxony
four
princes
of
the
empire
and
the
representatives
of
two
imperial
cities
nuremberg
and
reutlingen
the
friends
of
the
pope
at
the
diet
presented
a
confutation
of
the
protestant
confession
and
thereupon
the
emperor
commanded
the
protestants
to
abandon
their
whole
cause
of
controversy
in
reply
they
protested
they
were
not
satisfied
with
the
confutation
and
asked
that
a
copy
of
it
might
be
given
them
that
they
might
make
answer
to
it
this
the
emperor
would
not
grant
nor
would
he
permit
an
answer
to
be
read
before
the
diet
which
philip
melanchthon
had
written
out
from
memory
a
number
of
conferences
were
held
between
the
leaders
of
the
contending
parties
with
a
view
to
reach
an
honorable
compromise
but
they
had
drifted
too
far
apart
and
all
hope
of
reconciliation
was
lost
at
last
the
emperor
issued
a
decree
commanding
back
to
their
allegiance
to
the
pontiff
the
princes
and
cities
that
had
become
alienated
from
the
holy
see
of
rome
on
pain
of
incurring
the
vengeance
of
the
emperor
the
religious
changes
made
in
some
of
the
principalities
were
censured
and
the
edict
of
worms
against
luther
and
his
adherents
received
new
force
the
league
of
nothing
daunted
by
the
unfavorable
decree
of
the
emperor
the
protestant
princes
assembled
at
smalcald
and
entered
into
a
league
among
themselves
and
made
every
effort
to
induce
the
kings
of
england
france
denmark
and
other
princes
to
join
their
confederacy
this
movement
seriously
embarrassed
charles
for
he
was
just
on
the
eve
of
a
war
with
the
turks
and
needed
the
entire
strength
of
his
empire
he
therefore
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
protestant
princes
and
finally
agreed
to
annual
the
edict
of
worms
and
of
augsburg
allow
the
protestants
to
regulate
religious
matters
to
please
themselves
until
either
a
council
of
the
church
or
a
diet
of
the
empire
should
determine
what
religious
principles
should
be
approved
and
obeyed
the
council
to
be
called
within
six
months
such
were
the
concessions
of
the
emperor
on
their
part
the
protestant
princes
were
to
contribute
money
for
the
turkish
war
and
acknowledge
ferdinand

treaty

being
drawn
up
and
accepted
in
the
city

was
known
as
the
truce
of
nuremberg
and
under
it
the
protestant
cause
was
materially
strengthened
for
every
day

and
cities
threw
off
their
allegiance
to
the

urged
the
pontiff
to
call
the
council
which
was
to
settle
these
unhappy
difficulties
but
this
clement
vii
seemed
not
anxious
to
do
when
he
did
propose
a
council
it
was
at
places
in
italy
and
to
this
the
germans
would
not
consent
as
a
council
held
there
would
be
under
the
influence
of
the
pope
besides
the
controversy
had
arisen
in
germany
and
there
it
should
be
settled
the
protestants
also
insisted
that
the
decision
should
be
founded
solely
on
the
scriptures
a
point
which
required
the
church
of
rome
to
set
aside
all
the
former
decisions
of
her
great
councils
a
thing
her
pontiffs
were
in
no
temper
to
do
as
they
considered
themselves
in
the
position
of
a
parent
having
absolute
jurisdiction
dealing
with
a
refractory
child
finally
the
successor
of
clement
vii
paul
iii
with
the
approval
of
the
emperor
called
a
council
to
meet
at
trent
in
austria
in
the
austrian
tyrol
but
this
was
not
satisfactory
to
the
protestants
and
charles
x
despairing
of
settling
the
difficulties
by
peaceful
methods
and
being
urged
to
it
by
pope
paul
iii
prepared
to
settle
them
by
resorting
to
force
while
the
catholics
and
protestants
were
preparing
for
this
conflict

by
the

to
consent
to
refer
the
religious
controversy
to
the
council
of

but
it
being
reported
that

was

hence
it
became
necessary
to
formulate
a
treaty
which
should
bind
both
parties

the
convening
of
a
council
this
treaty
was
called
the

and
was
of
course
most
favorable
to
the
victorious
party
the
catholics
and
went
far
towards
establishing

at
last
the
emperor
persuaded
the
pope
to
the
council
of
trent
and
gave
notice
to
the
protestants
to
attend
promising
to
use
his
best
endeavor
to
have
everything
done
in
a
christian
manner
and
without
passion
but
before
this
council
could
assemble
the
protestant
princes
revolted
took
the
emperor
by
surprise
and
forced
him
into
signing
a
treaty
at
paussau
in
which
guaranteed
religious
liberty
to
the
protestants
this
treaty
was
by
the
emperor
in
the
diet
at
augsburg
by
that
treaty
all
who
had
accepted
the
confession
of
augsburg
were
declared
free
from
all

roman
pontiff
and
his
bishops
they
were
to
be
permitted
to
live
in
peace
and
the
quiet
enjoyment

liberty
men
were
to
be
left
free

the
reformed
or
the
catholic
church

any

the
fruit

tended

its
result
was
indeed
glorious
worth
all
the

it
had
cost
to
gain
it
but
it
was
not
a
reformation
if
by
that
is
meant
the
bringing
back
of
primitive
christianity
that
the
reformers
did
not
do
indeed
they
left
more
truth
in
the
catholic
church
than
they
brought
out
with
them
or
found
in
their
speculations

church

humiliation
of

was
the
fourth
day
on
which
he
had
borne
the
humiliating
garb
of
an
affected
penitent
and
in
that
sordid
raiment
he
drew
near
on
his
bare
feet
to
the
more
than
imperial
majesty
of
the
church
and
prostrated
himself
in
more
than
servile
deference
before
the
diminutive
and
emaciated
old
man
from
the
terrible
glance
of
whose
countenance
we
are
told
the
eyes
of
every
beholder
recoiled
as
from
the
lightning
hunger
cold
and
nakedness

shame

moment
crushed

cried
for
mercy
again
and
again
renewing
his
entreaties
until
he
had
reached
the
lowest
level
of
abasement
to
which
his
own
enfeebled
heart
or
the
haughtiness
of
his
great
antagonist
could
depress
him

its

as

antiquity
it
must
be
allowed
whether
as
regards
politics
philosophy
or
literature
was
greatly
superior
to
the
europe
of

fourteenth

centuries
it
is
not

therefore
that
it
should
have
exercised
so
great
an
influence
that
lofty
vigorous
elegant
and
fastidious
minds
should
have
been
disgusted
with
the
coarse
manners
the
confused
ideas
the
barbarous
modes
of

time
and
should
have
devoted
themselves
with
enthusiasm
and
almost
with
veneration
to
the
study
of
a
state
of
society
at
once
more
regular
and
more
perfect
than
their
own
thus
was
formed
that
school
of
bold
thinkers
which
appeared
at
the
commencement
of
the
fifteenth
century

and
men
of

luther
on

was
compelled
in
my
conscience
to
expose
the
scandalous
sale
of
indulgences
i
saw
some
seduced
by
them
into
mischievous
errors
others
tempted
into
an
audacious
profaneness
in
a
word
the
proclaiming
and
selling
of
pardons
proceeded
to
such
an
unbounded
licentiousness
that
the
holy
church
and
its
authorities
became
subjects
of
open
derision
in
the
public
taverns
there
was
no
occasion
to
excite
the
hatred
of
mankind
against
priests
to
a
greater
degree
the
avarice
and
profligacy
of
the
clergy
had
for
many
years
past
kindled
the
indignation
of
the
laity
alas
they
have
not
a
particle
of
respect
or
honor
for
the
priesthood
except
what
solely
arises
from
fear
of

george

corruption

george

regarded
as
a
bigoted
papist
esteemed
by
the
roman
catholics
as
a
most
sincere
and
active
defender
of
the
faith
of
his
day
his
testimony
therefore
to
the
sale
and
evils
of
indulgences
and
the
corruption
of
the
clergy
is
the
more
valuable
he
entirely
approved
of
luther
condemnation

which
ought
to
be
obtained
by
prayer

neighbor

other
good
works
said
the

sold
for
money
their
value
is
extolled
beyond
all
decency
the
sole
object
is
to
gain
a
deal
of
money
hence
the
preachers
who
are
bound
to
set
forth
truth
teach
men
nothing
but
lies
and
frauds
they
are
not
only
suffered
to
go
on
thus
but
they
are
well
paid
for
their
fraudulent
harangues
the
reason
is
the
more
conviction
they
can
produce
among
their
hearers
the
more
money
flows
into
the
chest
rivers
of
scandalous
proceedings
arise
from
this
corrupt
fountain
the
officials
of
the
bishops
are
equally
attentive
to
scrape
money
together
they
vex
the
poor
with
their
censures
for
great
crimes
as
whoredom
adultery
blasphemy
but
they
spare
the
rich
the
clergy
commit
the
very
same
crimes
and
nobody
censures
them
faults
which
ought
to
be
expiated
by
prayers
and
fastings
are
atoned
for
by
money
in
order
that
the
officials
may
pay
large
sums
to
their
respective
bishops
and
retain
a
portion
of
the
gain
for
themselves
neither
when
a
fine
is
inflicted
is
it
done
in
a
way
to
stop
the
commission
of
the
same
fault
in
the
future
but
rather
so
that
the
delinquent
understands
he
may
soon
do
that
very
thing
again
provided
he
be
but
ready
to
pay
hence
all
the
sacraments
are
sold
for
money
and
where
that
is
not
to
be
had
they
are
absolutely
neglected

even
from
those
of
which
only
the
pope
can
take
cognizance
he
released
from
all
the
punishments
of
purgatory
gave
permission
to
come
to
the
sacraments
and
promised
to
those
who
purchased
their
indulgences
that
the
gates
of

should
be
closed

on
the
of

a
placard
was
posted
on
the
walls
of

inviting
the
professors
and
students
to
be
present
at
nine
in
the
morning
at
the
eastern
gate
near
the
holy
cross
a
great
number
of
doctors
and
students
assembled
and
luther
walking
at
their
head
conducted
the
procession
to
the
appointed
place
how
many
burning
piles
has
rome
erected
during
the
course
of
ages
luther
resolves
to
make
a
better
application
of
the
great
roman
principle
it
is
only
a
few
old
papers
that
are
to
be
destroyed
and
fire
thinks
he
is
intended
for
that
purpose
a
scaffold
had
been
prepared
one
of
the
oldest
masters
of
arts
set
fire
to
it
as
the
flames
rose
high
into
the
air
the
formidable
augustine
wearing
his
frock
approached
the
pile
carrying
the
canon
law
the
decretals
the
clementines
the
papal
extravagants
some
writings
by
eckius
and
emser
and
the
pope
bull
luther
held
up
the
bull
and
said
since
thou
hast
vexed
the
holy
one
of
the
lord
may
everlasting
fire
vex
and
consume
thee
he
then
flung
it
into
the
flames
never
had
war
been
declared
with
greater
energy
and
resolution
after
this

calmly
returned
to

of

testifying
their
approval

loud
cheers

of

excommunication
of
the
excommunication
bull
was
an
attack
upon
the
rights
of
the
german
churches
for
luther
had
appealed
to
an
ecclesiastical
council
and
in
consequence
of
this
appeal
the
pope
could
no
longer
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case
hence
the
number
of
luther
friends
increased
the
more
after
the
publication
of
this
schlegel
the
character
of
seckendorf
defies
all
the
adversaries
of
luther
to
fix
any
just
censure
on
his
character
except
what
may
be
ranked
under
two
heads
a
disposition
to
anger
and
an
indulgence
in
jesting
beyond
all
doubt
the
saxon
reformer
was
of
a
choleric
temper
and
he
too
often
gave
way
to
this
constitutional
evil
as
he
himself
laments
neither
is
it
to
be
denied
that
he
also
too
much
encouraged
his
natural
propensity
to
facetiousness
the
monks
of
his
time
were
in
general
guilty
of
the
like
fault
and
often
to
so
great
a
degree
as
very
improperly
to
mix
scurrilities
with
sacred
subjects
moreover
the
vices
and
follies
of
those
whom
luther
opposed
afforded
a
strong
temptation
both
to
the
spirit
of
anger
and
of
ridicule
for
however
severe
he
may
be
thought
in
many
of
his
invectives
we
are
compelled
by
unquestionable
evidence
to
confess
that
his
keenest
satirical
pieces
never
reached
the
demerits
of
those
who
ruled
the
church
in
that
age
but
after
all
that
can
be
said
in
mitigation
it
must
be
owned
that
a
reformer
ought
to
have
considered
not
so
much
what
they
deserved
as
what
became
the
character
he
had
to
support
that
of
a
serious
christian
zealous
for
the
honor
of
his
god
displeased
with
the
vices
of
his
clerical
brethren
and
grieved
on
account
of
the
pitiable
ignorance
of
the
people
yet
more
desirous
of
curing
the
prevailing
evils
than
of
exposing
milner
the
pestilence
and
the
council
of
the
report
of
a
pestilence
was
a
mere
pretense
the
pope
paul
iii
was
equally
zealous
of
the
council
which
had
not
been
disposed
in
all
respects
to
govern
itself
by
his
prescription
and
of
the
governing
power
of
the
emperor
which
he
did
not
wish
to
see
farther
increased
by
the
council
he
indeed
hated
the
protestants
but
he
did
not
wish
to
see
the
emperor
under
color
of
enforcing
the
decrees
of
the
council
acquire
a
more
absolute
authority
over
germany
he
had
already
withdrawn
his
troops
from
the
imperial
army
and
he
now
wished
to
see
the
council
dispersed
the
spanish
members
opposed
him
but
he
found
means
to
schlegel

centuries
may
be
considered

age
of

section
ii
controversy
on
the
question
of
it
is
now
for
us
to
consider
the
principles
at
issue
in
the
reformation
luther
at
the
first
began
his
opposition
to
the
pope
by
denouncing
indulgences
and
there
can
be
no
question
but
he
and
every
other
honest
christian
had
just
cause
of
complaint
and
indignation
against
this
infamous
traffic
and
against
the
church
for
permitting
it
yet
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
was
a
wide
difference
between
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church
respecting
indulgences
see
note
end
of
section
and
the
things
taught
by
the
infamous
john
tetzel
this
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
tetzel
with
other
agents
of
the
pope
were
censured
for
their
over
zeal
and
excesses
in
dealing
in
indulgences
miltitz
whom
the
pope
had
appointed
to
treat

luther

his
reconciliation

twice
rebuked
him
with
the
greatest
severity
before
the
bishops
of
his
province
on
account
of
his
iniquitous
proceedings
in
the
sale
of
indulgences
and
he
finally
died
neglected
and
alone
deserted
by
all
the
world
see
note
end
of
section
these
abuses
in
the
sale
of
indulgences
and
the
other
corruptions
which
had
crept
into
the
church
formed
a
just
cause
of
complaint
but
they
were
not
the
true
point
at
issue
in
the
controversy
some
time
before
he
opposed
indulgences
luther
if
we
may
believe
had
imbibed
ideas
in
respect
to
the
part
which
the
grace
of
god
takes
in
the
salvation
of
man
that
would
have
led
him
to
oppose
the
church
of
rome
if
the
abuses
in
the
matter
of
indulgences
had
never
existed
in
order
that
the
student
may
grasp
this
subject
in
its
fullness
and
the
better
understand
this
controversy
between
luther
and
the
catholic
church
we
shall
make
a
careful
statement
of
the
facts
which
enter
into
the
question
of
grace
and
the
free
will
of
man
of
the
mind
is
conscious
of
a
power
of
deliberation
before
the
intellect
passes
the
different
motives
of
action
interests
passions
opinions
etc
the
intellect
considers
compares
estimates
and
finally
judges
them
this
is
a
preparatory
work
which
precedes
the
act
of
will
free
agency
or
when
deliberation
has
taken
place
when
man
has
taken
full
cognizance
of
the
motives
which
present
themselves
to
him
he
takes
a
resolution
of
which
he
looks
upon
himself
as
the
author
which
arises
because
he
wishes
it
and
which
would
not
arise
unless
he
did
wish
it
here
the
fact
of
agency
is
shown
it
resides
complete
in
the
resolution
which
man
makes
after
deliberation
it
is
the
resolution
which
is
the
proper
act
of
man
which
subsists
by
him
alone
a
simple
fact
independent
of
all
the
facts
which
precede
it
or
surround
it
will
or
agency
at
the
same
time
that
man
feels
himself
free
he
recognizes
the
fact
that
his
freedom
is
not
arbitrary
that
it
is
placed
under
the
dominion
of
a
law
which
will
preside
over
it
and
influence
it
what
that
law
is
will
depend
upon
the
education
of
each
individual
upon
his
surroundings
etc
to
act
in
harmony
with
that
law
is
what
man
recognizes
as
his
duty
it
will
be
the
task
of
his
liberty
he
will
soon
see
however
that
he
never
fully
acquits
himself
of
his
task
never
acts
in
full
harmony
with
his
moral
law
morally
capable
of
conforming
himself
to
his
law
he
falls
short
of
doing
it
he
does
not
accomplish
all
that
he
ought
nor
all
that
he
can
this
fact
is
evident
one
of
which
all
may
give
witness
and
it
often
happens
that
the
best
men
that
is
those
who
have
best
conformed
their
will
to
reason
have
often
been
the
most
struck
with
their
insufficience
of
external
this
weakness
in
man
leads
him
to
feel
the
necessity
of
an
external
support
to
operate
as
a
fulcrum
for
the
human
will
a
power
that
may
be
added
to
its
present
power
and
sustain
it
at
need
man
seeks
this
fulcrum
on
all
sides
he
demands
it
in
the
encouragement
of
friends
in
the
councils
of
the
wise
but
as
the
visible
world
the
human
society
do
not
always
answer
to
his
desires
the
soul
goes
beyond
the
visible
world
above
human
relations
to
seek
this
fulcrum
of
which
it
has
need
hence
the
religious
sentiment
develops
itself
man
addresses
himself
to
god
and
invokes
his
aid
through
prayer
finds
the
help
he
such
is
the
nature
of
man
that
when
he
sincerely
asks
this
support
he
obtains
it
that
is
seeking
it
is
almost
sufficient
to
secure
it
whosoever
feeling
his
will
weak
invokes
the
encouragement
of
a
friend
the
influence
of
wise
councils
the
support
of
public
opinion
or
who
addresses
himself
to
god
by
prayer
soon
feels
his
will
fortified
in
a
certain
measure
and
for
a
certain
time
of
spiritual
world
on
there
are
spiritual
influences
at
work
on
man
the
empire
of
the
spiritual
world
upon
liberty
there
are
certain
changes
certain
moral
events
which
manifest
themselves
in
man
without
his
being
able
to
refer
their
origin
to
an
act
of
his
will
or
being
able
to
recognize
the
author
certain
facts
occur
in
the
interior
of
the
human
soul
which
it
does
not
refer
to
itself
which
it
does
not
recognize
as
the
work
of
its
own
will
there
are
certain
days
certain
moments
in
which
it
finds
itself
in
a
different
moral
state
from
that
which
it
was
last
conscious
of
under
the
operations
of
its
own
will
in
other
words
the
moral
man
does
not
wholly
create
himself
he
is
conscious
that
causes
that
powers
external
to
himself
act
upon
and
modify
him
imperceptibly
this
fact
has
been
called
the
grace
of
god
which
helps
the
will
of
man
while
others
see
in
it
the
evidences
of
predestination
the
pelagian
from
these
facts
men
arrive
at
different
conclusions
some
regarding
only
the
power
of
man
to
deliberate
on
any
proposed
course
of
conduct
and
his
ability
to
decide
for
himself
what
course
he
will
pursue
ignoring
the
spiritual
influences
which
operate
on
him
and
taking
no
account
of
the
aid
which
comes
to
man
through
prayer
believe
that
man
conduct
depends
entirely
upon
his
will
tis
in
ourselves
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
say
they
and
hence
reject
the
fact
of
the
grace
of
god
and
the
influence
it
exerts
on
human
conduct
such
was
the
conclusion
arrived
at
by
pelagius
who
flourished
early
in
the
fifth
century
he
asserted
that
human
nature
is
not
fallen
that
there
is
no
hereditary
corruption
and
that
man
having
the
power
to
do
good
has
only
to
will
in
order
to
perform
his
doctrine
has
been
revised
several
times
and
has
drawn
to
it
not
a
few
believers
catholic
others
regarding
all
the
facts
elsewhere
enumerated
man
power
to
deliberate
his
ability
to
decide
upon
his
course
his
failure
to
do
all
that
his
reason
teaches
him
it
is
his
duty
to
do
his
need
of
help
from
a
source
external
to
himself
the
assistance
he
can
and
does
obtain
through
prayer
and
lastly
the
influence
of
spiritual
forces
upon
man
leads
them
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
through
a
union
of
the
grace
of
god
and
the
free
will
of
man
that
men
arrive
at
last
at
righteousness
such
was
the
teaching
of
the
roman
catholic
church
protestant
others
still
looking
only
upon
the
influence
of
the
spiritual
world
on
man
and
noting
how
very
far
short
he
comes
of
doing
all
his
reason
teaches
him
it
is
his
duty
to
do
conclude
that
man
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
do
good
of
himself
that
he
can
exercise
no
will
to
work
righteousness
until
after
the
grace
of
god
makes
him
righteous
and
that
it
is
that
grace
altogether
which
causes
him
both
to
will
and
to
do
good
works
luther
fundamental
luther
belonged
to
this
class
long
before
he
came
to
an
open
rupture
with
the
pope
he
taught
the
doctrine
of
predestination
and
of
salvation
through
faith
alone
the
excellent
infallible
and
sole
preparation
for
grace
is
the
eternal
election
and
predestination
of
god
on
the
side
of
man
there
is
nothing
that
goes
before
grace
unless
it
be
impotency
and
even
rebellion
we
do
not
become
righteous
by
doing
what
is
righteous
but
having
become
righteous
we
do
what
is
righteous
since
the
fall
of
man
free
will
is
but
an
idle
word
and
if
man
does
all
he
can
he
still
sins
mortally
a
man
who
imagines
to
arrive
at
grace
by
doing
all
that
he
is
able
to
do
adds
sin
to
sin
and
is
doubly
guilty
that
man
is
not
justified
who
performs
many
works
but
he
who
without
works
has
much
faith
in
christ
what
gives
peace
to
our
consciences
is
this
by
faith
our
sins
are
no
longer
ours
but
christ
on
whom
god
has
laid
them
all
and
on
the
other
hand
all
christ
righteousness
belongs
to
us
to
whom
god
has
given
it
thus
taught
luther
and
this
became
the
first
the
main
theological
question
of
the
reformation
the
point
which
the
reformer
had
most
at
heart
in
all
his
labors
contests
and
dangers
says
a
respectable
authority
was
the
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
alone
note
end
of
section
it
is
but
just
to
the
reformer
however
that
it
should
be
known
that
he
did
not
himself
reject
good
works
but
on
the
contrary
exhorted
men
to
practice
them
but
he
condemns
those
who
did
them
with
an
idea
that
by
them
they
would
be
justified
or
that
they
were
necessary
to
salvation
he
held
also
that
in
order
to
do
good
works
men
must
first
be
justified
and
that
good
works
done
before
justification
were
even
sinful
the
mischief
of
luther
though
luther
did
not
reject
good
works
and
though
he
held
that
justifying
faith
would
produce
them
yet
his
doctrine
has
been
the
source
of
much
mischief
in
the
world
when
it
was
charged
by
his
vicar
general
staupitius
that
his
doctrines
were
the
delight
of
debauches
and
that
many
scandalous
practices
were
the
consequences
of
some
of
his
publications
he
could
not
deny
the
charge
but
contented
himself
by
saying
i
am
neither
afraid
of
such
censorious
representations
nor
surprised
to
hear
them
luther
doctrine
of
salvation
by
faith
alone
as
stated
by
melanchthon
with
his
approval
stands
thus
man
justification
before
god
proceeds
from
faith
alone
this
faith
enters
man
heart
by
the
grace
of
god
alone
this
leaves
man
a
passive
creature
in
relation
to
his
salvation
he
is
helpless
to
procure
it
he
can
do
nothing
to
hasten
it
he
is
helpless
he
must
wait
the
divine
workings
of
the
grace
of
god
as
all
things
which
happen
says
melanchthon
happen
necessarily
according
to
the
divine
predestination

is

far

their
doctrine
threw
open

licentiousness

it
furnished

with
this
defense
for
the
crimes
they
committed

our
fate
did
not
permit

to
do
otherwise
by
saying
that
good
works
were
not

to

and
assisted
in
no
way
to
procure
it
the
reformers
took
away
the
chief
incentive
to
good
works
and
removed
the
principal
restraint
to
the
doing
of
evil
moreover
their
doctrine
rendered
void
the
ordinances
and
works
required
by
the
gospel
neither
repentance
nor
baptism
nor
any
other
act
of
obedience
to
god
is
essential
if
salvation
is
by

to
say
that
it
is
a
doctrine
adverse

isolated
passages
depended
upon
by
the

their
successors
to
support
it
is
not
necessary
here
it
is
sufficient
to
remark
that
it
is
a
doctrine
which
would
render
the
commandments
of
god
incompatible
with
the
powers
and
capacity
of
his
creatures
a
doctrine
which
destroys
at
once
the
consistency
of
god
and
the
moral
responsibility
of
man

therefore
a
doctrine
most
pernicious

dangerous

had
abolished

therefore

mankind
will
interpret
the
doctrine
in
a
carnal
way

so
understand
spiritual
liberty
as
to
allow
indulgences

this
we
may
see
in
all
the
ranks
of
life
all
profess
themselves
to
be

boast
of
their
christian
liberty

i
could
wish

counts
for
nothing
that
luther
denounced
this
corrupt
state
of
morals
among
his
followers
it
was
the
legitimate
outgrowth
of
his
fundamental
doctrine
the
doctrine
of
nearly
all
protestants
of
justification
by
faith
alone
a
faith
which
man
had
no
part
in
generating

which
came
through
the
grace
of

the
tree
of
his

was
vain
for
him
to

against
the
fruit

have
been

for

church

did
not

attached

great
importance
to
external
marks
of
repentance
to
works

penance

voluntary

were
added
to
these

punishments
see
note
end

and
men
learned
to
look
upon
these
works
of
penance
as
purchasing
a
forgiveness
of
sins
and
paid
little
attention
to
the
inward
regeneration
of
the
heart
as
confession
and
penance
are
easier
than
the
extirpation
of
sin
and
the
abandonment
of
vice
many
ceased
contending
against
the
lusts

the
flesh

preferred
gratifying

consideration
the

trusted

in
the
works

did
not
insist
stoutly
enough
upon
repentance
a
godly
sorrow

worketh
a
reformation

the
reformers
went
to
one
extreme
in
attributing
man
justification
wholly
to

act

the
catholic

the
growth
of

the
thing
most
important
the
one
which
drew
with
it
the
gravest
consequences
and
which
led
to
the
greatest
good
produced
by
the
reformation
was
the
rebellion
of
luther
against
the
authority
of
the
pope
he
did
not
come
out
in
open
rebellion
at
the
first
but
arrived
at
that
state
by
gradual
and
imperceptible
steps
when
his
opposition
to
the
sale
of
indulgences
met
with
reproof
from
the
pontiff
he
appealed
from
the
pope
to
the
pope
when
that
pope
still
held
him
to
be
in
error
and
refractory
he
appealed
to
a
general
free
council
of
the
whole
church
but
when
no
heed
was
taken
of
this
appeal
and
leo
pressed
by
eckius
cajetan
and
others
excommunicated
him
he
then
answered
by
burning
the
pope
bull
of
excommunication
and
stood
in
open
rebellion
to
the
authority
of
the
pontiff
when
the
pope
appealed
to
emperor
charles
to
make
the
excommunication
of
some
force
by
the
power
of
the
secular
authority
vested
in
him
the
emperor
contrary
to
the
protests
of
the
pope
legates
resolved
to
give
the
reformer
a
hearing
before
proceeding
against
him
accordingly
luther
was
summoned
before
the
diet
at
worms
where
he
not
only
insisted
upon
having
a
hearing
before
a
free
general
council
of
the
church
but
a
council
that
would
accept
the
bible
as
the
final
authority
upon
the
questions
at
issue
between
himself
and
the
pontiff
the
catholic
rule
of
this
was
demanding
more
than
the
pope
could
grant
for
the
catholics
have
never
exalted
the
bible
above
the
church
but
have
always
held
that
the
scriptures
must
be
accepted
as
construed
by
the
church
and
in
the
days
of
luther
the
pope
was
the
church
the
catholic
rule
of
faith
in
respect
to
the
laws
by
which
the
church
is
to
be
governed
is
the
word
of
god
at
large
whether
written
in
the
bible
or
handed
down

as

no

it

beyond
all
questioning
a

but
the
difficulty
with
the
roman

church
was
that
it
was
no
longer
the
church
of
christ
as
already
proven
in

of

it
had
no

no

who
had
a
right
to

the
popes
and

of
the
church
taught
that
revelation
had
ceased
and
they
depended
on
scripture
and
tradition
alone
interpreted
by
themselves
for
their
guide
the
power
the

possessed
was
usurped

the
growth
of

it
had
become
both
arrogant

insolent

at

intolerable

when
a
man
was
found
possessing
the
courage
to
resent
its
presumption
and
defy
it
he
found
plenty
to
applaud
and
sanction
his
act
true
cause
of
the
we
can
not
ascribe
the
reformation
to
accidents
and
mischances
such
for
instance
as
the
jealousy
of
luther
because
the
sale
of
indulgences
was
entrusted
to
the
dominican
monks
instead
of
to
the
order
of
augustine
monks
to
which
he
belonged
we
can
not
assign
the
cause
of
the
reformation
to
this
neither
can
we
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
say
that
the
great
revolution
of
the
sixteenth
century
resulted
solely
from
a
pure
desire
to
reform
the
abuses
that
had
arisen
in
the
church
or
bring
back
christianity
to
its
primitive
purity
not
a
few
of
the
princes
that
favored
luther
in
his
revolt
against
the
pope
did
so
from
other
motives
than
those
prompted
by
a
desire
to
reform
the
church
many
of
the
temporal
monarchs
and
princes
were
jealous
of
the
power
exercised
within
their
dominions
by
the
roman
pontiffs
as
it
lowered
the
dignity
of
their
own
position
they
were
tired
moreover
of
the
assumed
right
of
the
pope
to
enter
their
dominions
and
under
one
pretext
or
another
tax
their
subjects
and
thus
not
only
impoverish
the
people
but
reduce
the
revenue
of
the
temporal
ruler
it
will
be
found
therefore
that
the
jealousy
ambition
and
interest
of
these
princes
and
not
a
desire
to
establish
pure
religion
made
them
factors
in

refused

he
still
was
aware
that

he
held
up

a
number
of

proceeding
on

principle
rejected
some
of

austere
man

he
more
than
any
other
man
luther
excepted
influenced
the
character
of
the
protestant
churches
he
held
many
views
that
were
at
variance
with
those
of
zwingle
the
latter
taught
that
civil
rulers
possessed
absolute
power
in
religious
matters
and
subjected
the
ministers
altogether
to
their
authority
calvin
held
that
the
church
should
be
free
and
independent
of
the
state
that
it
should
govern
itself
by
its
own
officers
whom
the

should

zwingle
recognized
a
gradation
of
officers
in
the
christian
church
calvin
held
that
all
were
equal
suitable
persons
appointed
and
ordained
with
the
consent
of
the
members
of
the
church
constituted
in
his
theory
of
church
government
a
legitimate
ministry
to
preach
the
gospel
and
administer
the
sacraments
but
for
the
government
of
the
church
a
number
of
men
were
chosen
by
the
people
from
among
the
most
venerable
and
respectable
of
the
congregation
these
men
were
called
presbyters
or
elders
they
were
all
equal
in
authority
and
even
the
preaching
minister
was
in
no
sense
superior
to
them
in
office
the
elders
of
a
single
church
or
congregation
convened

session
councils
composed

from

constituted

while
a
general
council
composed
of
elders
from
all
the
churches
was
known
as
the
general
assembly
the
elders
in
these
several
councils
were
all
regarded
as
equal
in
authority
and
had
full
power
to
enact
laws
relating
to
religious
matters
and
to
establish
the
discipline
of
the
church
such
is
the
order
of
church
government
founded
by
calvin
and
known
as
presbyterianism
difference
of
opinion
on
the
as
already
stated
in
a
previous
section
the
catholics
maintained
that
in
the
eucharist
the
bread
and
the
wine
were
converted
by
consecration
into
the
very
body
and
blood
of
messiah
zwingle
maintained
that
the
bread
and
wine
were
symbols
merely
of
christ
flesh
and
blood
employed
to
call
to
mind
his
death
and
the
blessings
procured
to
man
by
that
death
calvin
stood
between
these
two
extremes
as
also
did
luther
and
while
they
disagreed
with
catholics
and
would
not
concede
that
the
bread
and
wine
were
changed
to
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
neither
would
they
concede
that
the
bread
and
wine
were
merely
symbols
but
insisted
upon
a
sort
of
spiritual
presence
that
is
they
held
that
the
saints
in
the
exercise
of
faith
in
partaking
of
the
sacrament
do
become
united
in
a
certain
mystic
way
with
christ
and
from
this
union
received
an
increase
of
spiritual
life
another
thing
in
which
calvin
differed
from
zwingle
was
in
relation
to
the
celebrated
doctrine
of
an
absolute
decree
of
god
respecting
the
salvation
of
men
calvin
emphasized
the
doctrines
of
luther
and
melanchthon
in
regard
to
the
part
which
the
grace
of
god
takes
in
the
salvation
of
men
and
perhaps
carried
it
further
than
they
would
have
done
certainly
further
than
zwingle
did
on
this
point
calvin
taught
that
god
had
elected
some
persons
from
all
eternity
to
everlasting
life
and
had
appointed
others
to
everlasting
punishments
and
that
for
this
he
had
no
other
ground
except
his
own
pleasure
or
his
most
free
and
sovereign
will
this
is
the
doctrine
of
predestination
the
spread
of
calvin
it
was
some
time
before
the
swiss
could
be
brought
to
accept
these
doctrines
so
at
variance
with
or
not
found
in
the
teachings
of
zwingle
yet
by
the
perseverance
and
the
high
reputation
for
learning
and
piety
of
calvin
they
were
very
generally
accepted
in
switzerland
and
after
him
such
was
the
success
of
his
pupils
that
large
bodies
of
protestants
in
other
nations
accepted
his
doctrines
especially
was
this
the
case
in
france
england
scotland
and
even
in
germany
the
reformation
in
in
france
though
in
the
main
her
people
adhered
to
the
catholic
church
the
reformation
found
its
most
faithful
adherents
and
there
they
suffered
the
most
violent
persecutions
the
protestants
were
opprobriously
called
huguenots
the
origin
of
the
appellation
is
uncertain
among
these
french
protestants
were
men
of
high
character
and
not
a
few
bishops
of
the
church
the
king

the
magistrates
however
protected
the
ancient
religion
by
the
sword

penal
inflictions

to

nation
after

the

set

himself

as
he

his

conspired

banished
him

had
been

established

he
was
more
prudent
than
his

permitted
the
leaders

the

a
circumstance

mitigates
if

the

took
on

different
aspect

it
did
in

other
countries
when
luther
began
his
assault
upon
the
church
of
rome
the
english
monarch
henry
viii
appeared
as
a
champion
on
the
side
of
the
roman
pontiffs
he
wrote
a
book
against
luther
in
defense
of
the
seven
sacraments
of
the
catholic
church
which
met
with
such
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
pope
that
he
conferred
upon
henry
the
title
of
defender
of
the
faith
book
appeared
in
soon
after
this
the
king
began
to
question
the
legality
of
his
marriage
with
catherine
of
aragon
catherine
had
been
the
wife
of
the
king
deceased
brother
arthur
and
a
marriage
with
a
deceased
brother
widow
was
regarded
as
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
henry
therefore
applied
to
the
pope
for
the
annulment
of
his
marriage
since
his
conscience
would
not
permit
him
to
cohabit
longer
with
his
deceased
brother
wife
the
conduct
of
the
king
however
was
such
as
to
give
strong
ground
to
the
belief
that
it
was
his
love
for
ann
boleyn
an
english
lady
of
high
birth
and
not
conscientious
scruples
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
his
marriage
with
catherine
the
queen
beauty
had
faded
and
some
disease
it
is
said
had
rendered
her
person
less
agreeable
still
to
do
henry
justice
it
must
not
be
concealed
that
his
father
had
scrupled
the
legitimacy
of
the
marriage
a
foreign
court
had
made
it
an
objection
to
intermarriage
with
his
children
by
his
wife
and
the
people
of
england
very
generally
entertained
fears
respecting
the
succession
to
his
crown
and
these
political
considerations
doubtless
had
their
influence
still
it
will
not
be
denied
that
after
the
king
had
fallen
in
love
with
ann
boleyn
his
love
for
her
and
not
political
considerations
or
religious
scruples
was
the
incentive
that
prompted
him
to
seek
a
divorce
the
rupture
with
the
the
pope
clement
vii
evaded
a
direct
answer
to

appeal
catherine
was
the
aunt
of
charles

and
perhaps
clement
feared
that
he
would
offend
that
monarch
to
whom
he
looked
to
suppress
the
reformation
in
germany
if
he
granted
the
divorce
henry
impatient
of
these
enforced
delays
consulted
the
universities
of
europe
and
as
most
of
them
pronounced
marriage
with
a
deceased
brother

unlawful
he
divorced
catherine
without

consent
of

a
quarrel
ensued
between
the
king

resulted
in

off

learned
and
became
attached
to

compelled
the

in

to

to
scotland
where

denunciations
of

ensued

through
the
assistance
of

a
truce
was
proclaimed
and
a
parliament
chosen

met

which

after

the

difficulties
were
far
from

a
controversy
arose
between
the
church
and
the
crown
on
the
subject
of
authority
it
will
be
remembered
that
calvin
insisted
that
the
church
should
be
independent
of
the
state
and
nowhere
was
it
so
strenuously
insisted
upon
as
in
scotland
not
only
did
it
demand
of
the
secular
authority
freedom
from
interference
but
assumed
the
right
to
reprove
the
king
and
his
court
and
that
too
in
no
guarded
language
in
andrew
melville
was
summoned
before
the
king
council
to
give
an
account
of
some
seditious
language
employed
by
him
in
the
pulpit
against
the
court
he
declined
the
jurisdiction
of
the
council
on
the
ground
that
he
was
responsible
only
to
the
church
for
such
language
and
the
king
could
not
judge
of
the
matter
without
violating
the
immunities
of
the
church
the
king
and
council
however
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
the
supremacy
of
the
secular
power
and
thus
was
begun
a
controversy
which
united
with
the
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
sovereigns
and
parliament
to
restore
the
episcopal
form
of
church
government
led
to
violent
persecutions
on

part

secular

of
the

declared
publicly
that
he
would
rather
resign
his
crown
and
retire
from
the
kingdom
than
rule
over
a
people
subjected
to
the
laws
and
authority
of
the
roman
pontiff
and
more
obedient
to
their
bishops
than
to
their
mosheim
the
danish
and
swedish
bishops
stripped
of
violent
measures
were
adopted
and
the
bishops
against
their
wills
and
their
efforts
to
the
contrary
were
deprived
of
their
honors
their
prerogatives
and
their
possessions
yet
this
reformation
of
the
clergy
in
both
those
northern
kingdoms
was
not
a
religious
but
a
mere
civil
and
secular
transaction
and
it
was
so
necessary
that
it
must
have
been
undertaken
if
no
luther
had
arisen
for
the
bishops
had
by
corrupt
artifices
got
possession
of
so
much
wealth
so
many
cattle
such
revenues
and
so
great
authority
that
they
were
far
more
powerful
than
the
kings
and
were
able
to
govern
the
whole
realm
at
their
pleasure
indeed
they
had
appropriated
to
themselves
a
large
portion
of
the
patrimony
of
the
kings
and
of
the
public
revenues
such
therefore
was
the
state
both
of
the
danish
and
the
swedish
commonwealths
in
the
time
of
luther
that
either
the
bishops
who
shamefully
abused
their
riches
their
prerogatives
and
their
honors
must
be
divested
of
the
high
rank
they
held
in
the
state
and
be
deprived
of
their
wealth
or
the
ruin
of
those
kingdoms
the
irreparable
detriment
of
the
public
safety
and
tranquility
and
the
sinking
of
their
kings
into
contempt

man
of

of
earnest

manly
courage
he
made
a
strong
impression
upon

an
impression
that
was
not
effaced
at
the
time
of
the

the
lollards
as
his
disciples
were
called
were
to
be

among

any

than
occasional

which
had

never

would
at
no
great
distance

been
effected
under
the
names
of

other
reformers
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
learned
doubtfully
and
with
caution
the
ignorant
with
zeal
and
eagerness
were
tending
to
depart
from
the
faith
and
rites
which
authority
prescribed
but
probably
not
even
germany
was
so
far
advanced
on
this
course
as
england
almost
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
luther
nearly
the
same
doctrines
as
he
taught
had
been
maintained
by
wycliffe
whose
disciples
usually
called
lollards
lasted
as
a
numerous
though
obscure
and
proscribed
sect
till
aided
by
the
confluence
of
foreign
streams
they
swelled
into
the
protestant
church
of
england
we
hear
indeed
little
of
them
during
some
parts
of
the
fifteenth
century
for
they
generally
shunned
persecution
and
it
is
chiefly
through
records
of
persecution
that
we
learn
of
the
existence
of
heretics
but
immediately
before
the
name
of
luther
was
known
they
seem
to
have
become
more
numerous
or
to
have
attracted
more
attention
since
several
persons
were
burned
for
heresy
and
others
abjured
their
errors
in
the
first
years
of
henry
viii
reign
some
of
these
as
usual
among
ignorant
men
engaging
in
religious
speculation
are
charged
with
very
absurd
notions
but
it
is
not
so
material
to
observe
their
peculiar
tenets
as
the
general
fact
that
an
inquisitive
and
sectarian
spirit
had
begun
to
hallam

henry
viii
and
his
revolt
against
soon
after
henry
was
declared
by
parliament
the
only
supreme
head
on
earth
of
the
church
of
england
the
authority
of
the
pope
was
finally
abolished
and
all
tributes
paid
to
him
were
declared
illegal
but
although
the
king
thus
separated
from
the
church
of
rome
he
professed
to
maintain
the
catholic
doctrine
in
its
purity
and
persecuted
the
reformers
most
violently
so
that
while
many
were
burned
as
heretics
for
denying
the
doctrines
of
catholicism
others
were
executed
for
maintaining
the
supremacy
of
the
pope
as
therefore
the
earnest
adherents
of
both
religions
were
equally
persecuted
and
equally
encouraged
both
parties
were
induced
to
court
the
favor
of
the
king
who
was
thus
enabled
to
assume
an
absolute
authority
over
the
nation
and
to
impose
upon
it
his
own
doctrines
as
those
of
the
only
true
church
when
news
of
these
proceedings
reached

the
most
terrible
fulminations
were
hurled
by

a

a
dread
which

was
also
obvious
from

that
there
would
be
perpetual
temptations

in

of

poverty
they
could
give
their

but
very
limited
opportunities
for
attending
school
yet
joseph
learned
to
read
to
write
and
had
some
knowledge
of
the
rudimentary
principles
of
arithmetic
when
joseph
was
ten
years
of
age
his
father
moved
from
the
state

to
that
of

settling

years
later
the
family
moved
from

to
manchester
in
the
same
county
religious
while
the
smith
family
lived
in
manchester
when
joseph
was
in
his
fifteenth
year
there
was
an
unusual
excitement
on
the
subject
of
religion
it
began
with
the
methodists
but
soon
became
general
among
all
the
sects
and
union
revival
meetings
in
which
all
sects
took
part
were
held
in
the
vicinity
of
manchester
the
smith
family
being
by
nature
religiously
inclined
became
interested
in

meetings
and
several
of
them
joseph
mother
his
brothers
hyrum
and
samuel
harrison
and
his
sisters
lucy
and
sophronia
were
converted
to
the
presbyterian
faith
joseph
own
mind
was
much
wrought
up
by
this
religious
agitation
and
at
one
time
he
became
somewhat
partial
to
the
methodist
persuasion
he
was
greatly
perplexed
however
by
the
strife
among
the
sects
and
the
divisions
which
existed
the
presbyterians
were
opposed
to
the
methodists
and
baptists
and
these
last
named
sects
though
not
agreeing
with
each
other
were
equally
opposed
to
the
presbyterians
why
should
the
church
of
christ
be
split
up
into
fractions
is
god
the
author
of
confusion
would
he
teach
one
society
to
worship
one
way
and
administer
one
set
of
ordinances
and
then
teach
another
society
quite
a
different
system
of
worship
and
another
set
of
principles
and
ordinances
different
from
those
taught
the
first
such
were
the
questions
joseph
smith
frequently
asked
himself
when
he
reflected
upon
the
confusion
he
witnessed
in
the
midst
of
the
war
of
words
and
tumult
of
opinion
that
accompanied
this
agitation
joseph
would
often
say
to
himself
what
is
to
be
done
who
of
all
these
parties
are
right
joseph
smith
first
prayer
and
while
floundering
in
the
midst
of
these
difficulties
he
came
to
the
following
passage
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
epistle
of
james
if
any
of
you
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
that
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
and
it
shall
be
given
him
this
passage
impressed
him
with
great
force
it
was
the
voice
of
god
to
him
if
any
man
lacked
wisdom
he
did
and
here
was
counsel
given
directly
how
to
obtain
it
with
a
promise
that
he
should
receive
it
and
not
be
unbraided
for
asking
he
at
last
decided
to
follow
the
divine
injunction
it
was
in
the
morning
of
a
beautiful
clear
day
early
in
the
spring
of
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
that
joseph
put
his
resolution
into
effect
he
selected
a
place
in
a
grove
near
his
father
house
for
that
purpose
it
was
his
first
attempt
to
pray
vocally
and
he
was
somewhat
timid
but
finding
himself
alone
he
knelt
down
and
began
to
offer
up
the
desires
of
his
heart
to
the
lord
he
had
scarcely
began
to
pray
when
he
was
seized
by
some
power
which
threw
him
violently
to
the
ground
and
it
seemed
for
a
time
that
he
was
doomed
to
a
sudden
destruction
it
was
no
imaginary
power
but
some
actual
being
from
the
unseen
world
his
tongue
for
a
time
was
bound
that
he
could
not
speak
darkness
gathered
about
him
but
exerting
all
his
powers
he
called
upon
god
to
deliver
him
out
of
the
hands
of
his
enemy
and
at
the
very
moment
he
was
ready
to
give
up
in
despair
and
abandon
himself
to
destruction
he
beheld
a
pillar
of
light
immediately
over
his
head
descending
towards
him
its
brightness
was
above
that
of
the
sun
at
and
no
sooner
did
it
appear
than
he
was
freed
from
the
enemy
which
had
held
him
bound
when
the
light
rested
upon
him
he
beheld
within
it
two
personages
standing
above
him
in
the
air
whose
brightness
and
glory
defy
all
description
but
they
exactly
resembled
each
other
in
form
and
features
one
of
them
pointing
to
the
other
said
joseph
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
him
joseph
purpose
in
calling
upon
the
lord
was
to
learn
which
of
the
sects
was
right
that
he
might
know
which
to
join
as
soon
therefore
as
he
gained
his
he
addressed
these
questions
to
the
personage
to
whom
he
was
directed
to
his
astonishment
he
was
told
that
none
of
the
sects
were
right
and
that
he
must
join
none
of
them
he
was
further
told
by
the
person
who
addressed
him
that
all
their
creeds
were
an
abomination
in
his
sight
that
those
professors
were
all
corrupt
that
they
drew
near
to
him
with
their
lips
but
their
hearts
were
far
from
him
that
they
taught
for
doctrine
the
commandments
of
men
that
they
had
a
form
of
godliness
but
denied
the
power
of
god
and
he
was
commanded
the
second
time
to
join
none
of
them
there
were
many
other
things
which
jesus
said
to
joseph
on
this
occasion
but
the
prophet
never
recorded
them
further
than
to
say
that
he
received
a
promise
that
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
would
at
some
future
time
be
made
known
to
him
the
importance
of
the
this
splendid
revelation
is
of
vast
importance
first
it
dispels
the
vagaries
that
men
had
conjured
up
in
respect
to
the
person
of
deity
instead
of
being
a
personage
without
body
parts
or
passions
it
revealed
the
fact
that
he
had
both
body
and
parts
that
he
was
in
the
form
of
man
or
rather
that
man
had
been
made
in
his
image
second
it
clearly
proves
that
the
father
and
son
are
distinct
persons
and
not
one
person
as
the
christian
world
believes
the
oneness
of
the
godhead
so
frequently
spoken
of
in
scripture
must
therefore
relate
to
oneness
of
sentiment
and
agreement
in
purpose
third
it
swept
away
the
rubbish
of
human
dogma
and
tradition
that
had
accumulated
in
all
the
ages
since
personal
ministry
on
earth
by
announcing
that
god
did
not
acknowledge
any
of
the
sects
of
christendom
as
his
church
nor
their
creeds
as
his
gospel
thus
the
ground
was
cleared
for
the
planting
of
the
truth
fourth
it
showed
how
mistaken
the
christian
world
was
in
claiming
that
all
revelation
had
ceased
that
god
would
no
more
reveal
himself
to
man
fifth
the
vision
created
a
witness
for
god
on
the
earth
a
man
lived
who
could
say
to
some
purpose
that
god
lived
and
that
jesus
was
the
christ
for
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
them
thus
was
laid
the
foundation
for
faith
we
shall
see
anon
how
the
foundation
was
broadened
the
interval
of
three
for
three
years
after
this
first
vision
joseph
received
no
other
visitation
or
revelation
and
as
he
had
been
forbidden
to
join
any
of
the
religious
sects
then
existing
he
stood
alone
it
was
a
period
of
severe
trial
a
few
days
after
his
first
vision
he
related
the
circumstance
to
a
methodist
minister
who
had
been
active
in
the
religious
agitation
before
mentioned
to
the
lad
surprise
he
treated
his
story
with
the
utmost
contempt
and
declared
it
to
be
from
the
devil
as
the
lord
gave
no
revelations
in
these
days
those
things
having
ceased
with
the
apostles
making
his
vision
public
brought
upon
him
the
ridicule
and
indignation
of
the
whole
neighborhood
especially
of
the
ministers
in
this
trying
period
of
three
years
according
to
his
own
statement
he
was
guilty
of
some
youthful
follies
but
he
was
true
to
god
and
continued
in
the
face
of
all
opposition
to
maintain
that
he
had
received
a
revelation
from
him
the
first
visit
of
on
the
of
september
having
retired
for
the
night
he
betook
himself
to
prayer
to
obtain
the
forgiveness
of
his
sins
and
a
manifestation
that
would
enable
him
to
know
his
standing
before
the
lord
while
thus
engaged
the
room
began
to
be
filled
with
light
and
presently
a
personage
appeared
by
his
bedside
standing
in
the
air
see
note
end
of
section
he
said
that
he
was
a
messenger
sent
from
the
presence
of
god
and
that
his
name
was
moroni
he
announced
to
joseph
smith
that
the
lord
had
a
work
for
him
to
do
and
that
his
name
would
be
had
for
good
and
evil
among
all
nations
the
book

angel
informed
joseph
of
the
existence

book

record
engraven
upon
golden
plates
giving
an
account
of
the
ancient
inhabitants

by

relating
these
things

then
the

will
not
hear
that
prophet
shall
be
destroyed
from
among
the
people
moroni
explained
that
the
prophet
here
spoken
of
was
jesus
christ
but
the
day
when
they
who
would
not
hear
his
voice
should
be
cut
off
from
among
the
people
had
not
yet
come
but
it
would
soon
come
b
the
angel
quoted
from
the
verse
to
the
end
of
the
second
chapter
of
joel
and
said
that
it
was
soon
to
be
fulfilled
it
predicts
the
outpouring
of
god
spirit
upon
all
flesh
the
signs
in
the
heavens
and
the
earth
which
are
to
precede
the
glorious
coming
of
messiah
and
foretells
the
safety
which
shall
be
found
in
mount
zion
and
jerusalem
in
those
troublous
times
the
warnings
of
after
making
these
and
other
explanations
the
light
within
the
room
seemed
to
condense
about
the
person
of
the
angel
and
he
departed
shortly
however
he
returned
and
repeated
what
he
had
said
on
his
first
appearance
and
again
withdrew
to
joseph
astonishment
he
appeared
the
third
time
and
again
repeated
his
message
in
his
first
appearance
that
eventful
night
the
angel
told
joseph
that
when
he
obtained
the
plates
containing
the
record
of
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
america
together
with
the
and
the
urim
and
thummim
the
full
time
for
them
to
be
given
to
him
had
not
then
arrived
he
was
to
show
them
to
no
person
except
those
to
whom
he
would
be
commanded
to
show
them
he
was
told
that
if
he
violated
his
commandment
he
would
be
destroyed
at
his
third
appearing
that
same
night
the
angel
cautioned
joseph
saying
that
satan
would
try
to
tempt
him
in
consequence
of
the
poverty
of
his
father
family
to
obtain
the
plates
for
the
purpose
of
getting
rich
this
he
forbade
him
saying
that
he
must
have
no
other
object
in
view
in
getting
the
plates
but
to
glorify
god
and
must
be
influenced
by
no
other
motive
than
that
of
building
up
his
kingdom
the
fourth
appearance
of
the
whole
night
was
consumed
in
these
interviews
with
the
angel
in
the
morning
of
the
day
following
joseph
went
to
his
usual
labors
but
was
so
exhausted
and
faint
that
he
found
himself
unable
to
pursue
them
his
father
who
was
laboring
with
him
observing
that
he
was
ailing
directed
him
to
go
home
in
attempting
to
climb
the
fence
out
of
the
field
where
he
was
working
his
strength
entirely
failed
him
and
he
fell
unconscious
to
the
ground
when
he
became
conscious
the
angel
who
had
visited
him
the
night
before
was
standing
by
him
calling
his
name
he
repeated
again
the
things
of
the
night
before
and
commanded
joseph
to
go
and
tell
his
father
of
them
this
he
did
and
his
father
testified
that
they
were
of
god
and
counseled
his
son
to
be
obedient
to
the
heavenly
vision
cumorah
and
its
joseph
went
immediately
to
the
hill
cumorah
where
the
ancient
record
was
hidden
so
vivid
had
been
his
vision
of
the
place
the
night
before
that
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
it

of
section
on
the
west
side
of
the
hill
cumorah
not
far
from
the
top
under
a
stone
of
considerable
size
lay
the
plates
deposited
in
a
stone
box
removing
the
soil
from
around
the
edges
of
the
stone
box
with
the
aid
of
a
lever
he
raised
it
up
and
to
his
joy
beheld
the
plates
the
urim
and
thummim
and
just
as
described
by
the
angel
he
was
about
to
take
these
treasures
from
the
box
when
the
messenger
of
the
previous
night
again
stood
before
him
and
told
him
again
that
the
time
for
bringing
them
forth
had
not
yet
arrived
and
would
not
until
four
years
from
that
date
the
angel
instructed
him
to
come
to
that
place
in
just
one
year
from
that
time
and
he
would
meet
with
him
and
that
he
would
continue
to
do
so
until
the
time
for
obtaining
the
plates
for
translation
had
come
accordingly
at
the
end
of
each
year
joseph
went
to
the
place
appointed
and
every
time
met
the
same
heavenly
messenger
who
gave
him
instruction
and
intelligence
in
respect
to
the
work
of
the
lord
and
how
the
christ
kingdom
was
to
be
conducted
in
these
last
days
translation
and

of
the
book
of
on
the
of
september
the
plates
together
with
the
urim
and
thummim
and
were
given
into
the
hands
of
joseph
smith
by
the
angel
moroni
with
a
strict
charge
to
keep
them
safe
saying
that
he
joseph
would
be
held
responsible
for
them
that
if
he
should
carelessly
or
through
any
neglect
of
his
let
them
go
he
would
be
cut
off
but
if
he
would
use
his
best
endeavors
to
preserve
them
they
should
be
protected
he
soon
learned
the
necessity
of
the
strict
charge
given
to
him
by
moroni
for
no
sooner
was
it
learned
that
he
had
the
plates
than
every
kind
of
device
not
even
omitting
that
of
violence
was
employed
to
wrest
them
from
him
he
guarded
them
safely
however
and
in
the
midst
of
much
persecution
and
many
difficulties
succeeded
by
the
help
of
the
lord
and
the
assistance
of
martin
harris
a
farmer
oliver
cowdery
a
young
school
teacher
who
acted
as
his
scribe
in
much
of
the
work
of
translation
and
the
whitmer
family
with
this
assistance
he
succeeded
in
completing
the
translation
and
publishing
the
work
in
the
year
the
in
the
course
of
the
work
of
translation
joseph
and
those
assisting
him
learned
from
the
record
itself
that
it
would
be
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
that
the
eyes
of
none
might
behold
it
except
three
witnesses
that
should
see
it
by
the
power
of
god
besides
him
to
whom
the
record
would
be
given
to
translate
and
a
few
others
who
should
view
it
that
they
might
bear
witness
of
the
work
of
god
to
the
children
of
men
oliver
cowdery
david
whitmer
and
martin

desired
to
become
the
three
witness
named
and
obtained
that
privilege
from
the
lord
some
time
in
june
the
promise
that
they
should
have
a
view
of
the
plates
the
urim
and
thummim
and
was
fulfilled
the
angel
moroni
appeared
unto
them
exhibited
to
them
those
sacred
things
and
commanded
them
to
bear
witness
of
their
existence
to
the
world
this
they
did
and
their
testimony
is
published
in
all
copies
of

the
plates
were
exhibited
by

also
published

the

of
now
the
thing
to
be
known
is
what
the
fullness
of

means
or
the
extent

thereof
it
means
this
that
the

the
dispensations
that
have
ever
been
given

is

to
know
that
god
spoke
to
him
with
his
own
voice
in
the
garden
and
gave
him
the
promise
of
the

description
of
he
had
on
a
loose
robe
of
most
exquisite
whiteness
it
was
a
whiteness
beyond
anything
earthly
i
had
ever
seen
nor
do
i
believe
any
earthly
thing
could
be
made
to
appear
so
exceedingly
white
and
brilliant
his
hands
were
naked
and
his
arms
also
a
little
above
the
wrist
so
also
were
his
feet
naked
as
were
his
legs
a
little
above
the
ankles
his
head
and
neck
were
also
bare
i
could
discover
that
he
had
no
other
clothing
on
but
this
robe
as
it
was
open
so
that
i
could
see
into
his
bosom
not
only
was
his
robe
exceedingly
white
but
his
whole
person
was
glorious
beyond
description
and
his
countenance
truly
like
joseph

of
great
price
description
of
as
you
pass
on
the
mailroad
from
palmyra
wayne
county
to
canandaigua
ontario
county
new
york
before
arriving
at
the
little
village
of
palmyra
you
pass
a
large
hill
on
the
east
side
of
the
road
why
i
say
large
is
because
it
is
as
large
perhaps
as
any
in
that
country
the
north
end
rises
quite
suddenly
until
it
assumes
a
level
with
the
more
southerly
extremity
and
i
think
i
may
say
an
elevation
higher
than
at
the
south
a
short
distance
say
half
or
of
a
mile
as
you
pass
towards
canandaigua
it
lessens
gradually
until
the
surface
assumes
its
common
level
or
is
broken
by
other
smaller
hills
or
ridges
and
ravines
i
think
i
am
justified
in
saying
that
this
is
the
highest
hill
for
some
distance
round
and
i
am
certain
that
its
appearance
as
it
rises
suddenly
from
a
plain
on
the
north
must
attract
the
notice
of
the
traveler
as
he
passes
by
the
north
end
which
has
been
described
as
rising
suddenly
from
the
plain
forms
a
promontory
without
timber
but
covered
with
grass
as
you
pass
to
the
south
you
soon
come
to
scattering
timber
the
surface
having
been
cleared
by
art
or
wind
and
a
short
distance
further
left
you
are
surrounded
with
the
common
forest
of
the
country
it
is
necessary
to
observe
that
even
the
part
cleared
was
only
occupied
for
pasturage
its
steep
ascent
and
narrow
summit
not
admitting
the
plough
of
the
husbandman
with
any
degree
of
ease
or
profit
it
was
at
the
second
mentioned
place
where
the
record
was
found
to
be
deposited
on
the
west
side
of
the
hill
not
far
from
the
top
down
its
side
and
when
myself
visited
the
place
in
the
year
there
were
several
trees
standing
enough
to
cause
a
shade
in
summer
but
not
so
much
as
to
prevent
the
surface
being
covered
with
grass
which
was
also
the
case
when
the
record
was

of

is
an
abridgment
made
from
more
extensive
records
kept
by
the
ancient
civilized
people
of
america
chiefly
by
the
people
known
in
the
book
of
mormon
as
nephites
the
abridgment
for
the
most
part
is
made
by
one
mormon
a
nephite
prophet
who
was
born
and
slain
by
his
enemies
in
the
year
the
parts
which
are
not
his
abridgment
are
the
first
pages
which
bring
us
to
the
words
of
mormon
page
and
from
page
to
the
end
of
the
volume
sixty
pages
this
latter
part
of
the
record
was
made
by
moroni
the
son
of
mormon
who
was
also
the
one
who
hid
up
the
plates
containing
his
father
and
his
own
abridgment
in
the
year
and
who
having
been
raised
from
the
dead
revealed
the
existence
of
these
plates
to
joseph
smith
the
first
pages
are
a
verbatim
translation
from
what
are
known
as
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
we
will
explain
the
first
nephi
who
left
jerusalem
with
a
small
company
of
colonists
led
out
from
that
city
by
his
father
lehi
and
who
afterwards
became
their
leader
prophet
and
their
first
king
made
two
sets
of
plates
on
which
he
proposed
engraving
the
history
of
his
people
on
the
larger
of
these
two
sets
he
engraved
an
account
of
his
life
travels
prophecies
together
with
his
genealogy
and
upon
them
also
he
recorded
a
full
history
of
the
wars
and
contentions
of
his
people
as
also
their
travels
and
an
account
of
the
cities
they
founded
and
colonies
they
established
these
larger
plates
were
preserved
in
the
care
of
succeeding
kings
or
judges
of
the
republic
when
the
kingdom
was
transformed
into
one
and
in
a
word
upon
them
was
written
a
full
history
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
nations
which
existed
in
america
from
the
landing
of
this
colony
from
jerusalem
to
a
period
of
nearly
one
thousand
years
it
is
quite
evident
that
as
these
plates
were
transmitted
from
king
to
king
or
from
one
ruling
judge
of
the
republic
to
another
or
given
into
the
possession
of
a
prophet
that
each
recorded
the
historical
events
of
his
own
day
and
gave
to
such
account
his
own
name
hence
mormon
found
in
these
larger
plates
of
nephi
the
book
of
mosiah
the
book
of
alma
the
book
of
helaman
etc
furthermore
it
happened
that
there
were
colonies
from
time
to
time
that
drifted
off
into
distant
parts
of
the
land
and
became
lost
for
a
season
to
the
main
body
of
the
people
and
there
were
missionary
expeditions
formed
for
the
conversion
of
the
lamanites
and
these
parties
whether
missionary
or
colonial
generally
kept
records
and
when
these
colonists
or
missionary
parties
were
found
or
returned
to
the
main
body
of
the
people
their
records
were
incorporated
within
the
main
record
being
kept
by
the
historian
hence
there
was
sometimes
a
book
within
a
book
and
the
current
of
events
was
interrupted
to
record
the
history
of
these
detached
portions
of
the
people
or
some
important
missionary
expedition
mormon
when
abridging
these
plates
of
nephi
gave
to
each
particular
division
of
his
abridgment
the
name
of
the
book
from
which
he
had
taken
his
account
of
the
events
recorded
hence
the
books
of
mosiah
alma
helaman
and
iii
and
iv
nephi
in
his
abridgment
he
also
in
some
instances
at
least
followed
the
we
have
alluded
to
hence
we
have
the
record
of
zeniff
within
the
book
of
mosiah
page
the
account
of
the
church
founded
by
the
first
alma
page
and
the
account
of
the
missionary
expeditions
of
the
sons
of
mosiah
to
the
lamanites
within
the
book
of
alma
page
of
the
literary
structure
of
the
again
we
caution
the
student
to
remember
that
the
book
of
mormon
is
for
the
most
part
an
abridgment
from
the
larger
plates
of
nephi
but
it
is
quite
evident
that
mormon
frequently
came
to
passages
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
which
pleased
him
so
well
that
he
transcribed
them
verbatim
upon
the
plates
containing
his
abridgment
an
example
of
this
will
be
found
beginning
on
page
in
the
second
line
of
the
ninth
paragraph
and
ending
with
page
the
words
of
king
benjamin
to
his
people
the
words
of
king
benjamin
are
also
renewed
on
page
in
the
second
line
of
the
fourth
paragraph
and
continue
to
the
close
of
the
chapter
there
are
many
such
passages
throughout
mormon
abridgment
in
addition
to
this
mormon
frequently
introduces
remarks
of
his
own
by
way
of
comment
warning
prophecy
or
admonition
and
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
neither
quotation
marks
nor
a
change
of
type
to
indicate
where
these
comments
or
what
we
might
call
annotations
begin
or
end
they
are
liable
to
confuse
the
reader
a
difficulty
that
we
hope
will
be
obviated
by
this
caution
so
much
for
mormon
abridgment
now
to
consider
the
part
of
the
work
done
by
his
son
moroni
this
is
from
page
to
the
end
of
the
volume
he
closes
up
the
record
of
his
father
mormon
and
then
gives
us
an
abridgment
of
the
plates
of
ether
which
were
found
in
north
america
by
the
people
of
limhi
in
the
second
century
and
then
concludes
his
work
with
notes
on
the
manner
of
ordaining
priests
and
teachers
administering
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
baptism
spiritual
gifts
together
with
a
sermon
and
some
of
his
father
letters
in
his
abridgment
of
the
record
of
the
jaredites
the
peculiarity
of
mixing
up
his
comments
admonitions
and
prophecies
with
his
narrative
is
even
more
marked
than
in
the
abridgment
of
mormon
therefore
the
reader
will
need
to
be
doubly
on
his
guard
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
came
to
be
attached
to
we
have
already
said
that
the
first
pages
of
the
book
of
mormon
were
not
a
part
of
mormon
abridgment
those
pages
are
a
verbatim
translation
of
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
and
became
connected
with
mormon
abridgment
in
this
manner
mormon
had
abridged
the
larger
plates
of
nephi
as
far
as
the
reign
of
king
benjamin
and
in
searching
through
the
records
which
had
been
delivered
to
him
he
found
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
they
contained
a
brief
history
of
events
connected
with
the
departure
of
lehi
and
his
colony
from
jerusalem
to
their
landing
in
america
and
thence
down
to
the
reign
of
this
king
benjamin
covering
a
period
of
about
years
these
plates
were
made
by
nephi
that
upon
them
might
be
engraven
an
account
of
the
ministry
of
the
servants
of
god
among
his
people
together
with
their
prophecies
and
teachings
they
contain
in
other
words
an
ecclesiastical
history
of
the
nephites
while
the
larger
plates
of
nephi
contained
a
political
or
secular
history
of
the
same
people
i
nephi
ix
xix
mormon
was
particularly
well
pleased
with
the
contents
of
these
smaller
plates
of
nephi
because
upon
them
had
been
engraven
so
many
prophecies
concerning
the
coming
and
mission
of
the
messiah
and
instead
of
condensing
the
history
recorded
on
them
into
an
abridgment
he
took
the
plates
themselves
and
attached
them
to
the
abridgment
of
nephi
larger
plates
and
i
do
this
for
a
wise
purpose
says
mormon
for
thus
it
whispereth
me
according
to
the
workings
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
is
in
me
words
of
mormon
page
nephi
also
in
speaking
of
these
smaller
plates
says
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
to
make
these
plates
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
which
purpose
i
know
not
i
nephi
wise
by
mormon
attaching
these
smaller
plates
of
nephi
to
his
own
abridgment
of
nephi
larger
plates
it
will
be
observed
there
was
a
double
line
of
history
of
the
nephites
for
about
years
and
the
wisdom
of
this
arrangement
is
seen
in
the
following
when
joseph
smith
had
translated
the
first
part
of
abridgment
amounting
to
pages
of
manuscript
he
listened
to
the
importunities
of
martin
harris
who
was
giving
him
some
assistance
in
the
work
of
translating
and
who
desired
to
show
that
portion
of
the
work
to
his
friends
the
result
was
the
manuscript
was
stolen
from
harris
the
records
were
taken
from
joseph
by
the
angel
and
for
a
season
he
lost
his
power
to
translate
after
a
time
however
he
was
permitted
to
go
on
with
the
work
but
the
lord
made
it
known
to
him
that
it
was
the
design
of
those
into
whose
hands
the
manuscript
had
fallen
to
wait
until
he
had
translated
that
part
again
and
then
by
changing
the
manuscript
in
their
possession
would
bring
it
forth
and
claim
that
he
could
not
translate
the
same
record
twice
alike
and
thus
they
would
seek
to
overthrow
the
work
of
god
but
the
heavenly
messenger
commanded
joseph
smith
not
to
translate
again
the
part
he
had
already
translated
but
instead
thereof
he
should
translate
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
and
that
account
was
to
take
the
place
of
mormon
abridgment
up
to
the
latter
days
of
the
reign
of
king
benjamin
doc
and
sec
thus
it
is
that
we
have
the
words
of
mormon
beginning
on
page
explaining
how
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
came
into
his
possession
and
attached
to
the
plates
containing
the
record
he
himself
was
making
and
connecting
the
historical
narrative
of
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
with
his
own
abridgment
of
nephi
larger
plates
the
words
of
mormon
interrupting
as
they
do
the
history
of
the
nephites
have
caused
no
little
confusion
in
the
minds
of
unthoughtful
readers
but
after
it
is
understood
that
they
are
merely
the
link
connecting
the
ecclesiastical
history
engraven
on
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
to
abridgment
and
that
they
take
the
place
of
the
first
part
of
record
the
difficulty
will
disappear
in
the
literary
style
of
the
smaller
plates
and
mormon
one
thing
we
can
not
forbear
to
mention
and
that
is
in
the
parts
of
the
book
of
mormon
translated
from
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
we
find
none
of
those
comments
or
annotations
mixed
up
with
the
record
that
we
have
already
spoken
of
as
being
peculiar
to
the
abridgment
made
by
mormon
a
circumstance
we
take
it
which
proves
the
book
of
mormon
to
be
consistent
with
the
account
given
of
the
original
records
from
which
it
was
translated
the
value
of
this
fact
appears
if
we
stop
to
consider
how
destructive
to
the
claims
of
the
book
it
would
be
if
the
peculiarity
of
mormon
abridgment
were
found
in
that
part
of
the
book
which
claims
to
be
a
verbatim
translation
of
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
there
will
be
found
however
in
this
translation
direct
from
the
smaller
plates
of
nephi
as
also
in
mormon
abridgment
extracts
from
the
old
jewish
scriptures
especially
from
the
writings
of
isaiah
this
is
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
when
lehi
colony
left
jerusalem
they
took
with
them
copies
of
the
books
of
moses
and
the
writings
of
the
prophets
and
the
record
of
the
jews
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
all
of
which
were
engraven
on
plates
of
brass
see
i
nephi
v
and
the
nephite
historians
transcribed
passages
from
these
sacred
records
into
their
own
writings
transcribed
there
are
a
few
suggestions
about
these
transcribed
passages
which
may
be
valuable
to
the
student
as
they
furnish
an
indirect
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
book
of
mormon
the
nephites
having
transcribed
passages
from
the
brass
plates
they
carried
with
them
from
jerusalem
into
their
records
wherever
such
passages
occur
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
corresponding
passages
are
found
in
our
english
bible
it
will
be
seen
by
the
reader
that
so
far
we
have
two
translations
of
the
writings
of
the
old
hebrew
prophets
and
it
will
be
found
on
comparison
that
the
passages
in
the
book
of
mormon
are
stronger
and
more
in
keeping
with
the
sense
sought
to
be
expressed
by
the
prophet
than
the
corresponding
passages
and
chapters
in
the
bible
as
a
proof
of
this
i
ask
the
student
to
compare
i
nephi
xx
and
xxi
with
isaiah
xlvii
and
xlix
in
some
instances
there
are
sentences
in
the
book
of
mormon
version
of
passages
from
isaiah
not
to
be
found
in
our
english
version
as
witness
the
following
book
of
mormon
o
house
of
jacob
come
ye
and
let
us
walk
in
the
light
of
the
lord
come
for
ye
have
all
gone
astray
every
one
to
his
wicked
ii
nephi
xii
bible
o
house
of
jacob
come
ye
and
let
us
walk
in
the
light
of
the
isa
ii
in
other
instances
it
will
be
found
that
the
sense
of
the
passages
is
different
and
that
the
passages
in
the
book
of
mormon
best
accord
with
the
sense
of
the
whole
book
of
mormon
therefore
o
lord
thou
hast
forsaken
thy
people
the
house
of
jacob
because
they
be
replenished
from
the
east
and
hearken
unto
soothsayers
like
the
philistines
and
they
please
themselves
in
the
children
of
ii
nephi
xii
their
land
is
also
full
of
idols
they
worship
the
work
of
their
own
hands
that
which
their
own
fingers
have
made
and
the
mean
man
boweth
not
down
and
the
great
man
humbleth
himself
not
therefore
forgive
him
ii
nephi
xii
thou
hast
multiplied
the
nation
and
increased
the
joy
they
joy
before
thee
according
to
the
joy
in
harvest
and
as
men
rejoice
when
they
divide
the
ii
nephi
xix
bible
therefore
thou
hast
forsaken
thy
people

of

observe
too
the
difference
in
the
clearness
of
the

of

when
they
shall
say
unto
you
seek
unto

that
have
familiar

and
unto

and

isa
viii
again
the
english
translators
of
the
bible
in
order
to
make
the
sense
of
various
passages
more
clear
inserted
here
and
there
words
of
their
own
which
are
always
written
in
that
the
reader
might
know
what
words
have
been
inserted
by
the
translator
and
for
which
he
will
find
no
equivalent
in
the
original
text
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
in
those
transcribed
passages
from
the
brass
plates
into
the
book
of
mormon
in
almost
every
instance
the
words
in
the
book
of
mormon
version
are
different
to
those
substituted
by
the
translators
of
the
common
english
version
or
are
left
out
as
follows
book
of
mormon
what
mean
ye
ye
beat
my
people
to
pieces
and
grind
the
faces
of
the
ii
nephi
xiii
bible
what
mean
ye
ye
beat
my
people
to
pieces
and
grind
the
faces
of
the
poor
isa
iii
the
above
is
a
case
where
the
inserted
word
of
the
translator
which
i
have
written
in
is
omitted
and
to
my
mind
the
passage
as
it
stands
in
the
book
of
mormon
is
the
stronger
and
more
beautiful
here
is
a
passage
where
different
words
are
used
than
those
inserted
by
the
translators
book
of
mormon
say
unto
the
righteous
that
it
is
well
with
them
for
they
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
their
doings
woe
unto
the
wicked
for
they
shall
perish
for
the
reward
of
their
hands
shall
be
upon
ii
nephi
xiii
bible
say
ye
to
the
righteous
that
shall
well
for
they
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
their
doings
woe
unto
the
wicked
shall
be
ill
with
for
the
reward
of
his
hands
shall
be
given
isa
iii
i
think
it
will
be
readily
conceived
that
the
above
passage
as
it
stands
in
the
book
of
mormon
is
much
superior
to
the
version
given
in
our
common
bible
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
joseph
smith
and
those
who
assisted
in
translating
that
work
were
most
likely
uninformed
as
to
the
supplied
words
of
the
translators
being
written
in
it
is
an
incidental
evidence
that
those
passages
in
the
book
of
mormon
to
which
are
found
corresponding
passages
in
the
bible
were
not
merely
copied
from
the
bible
but
in
the
book
of
mormon
we
have
really
another
translation
of
those
passages
taken
from
original
records
of
the
hebrews
uncorrupted
by
the
hand
of
man
and
hence
more
perfect
means
of
testing
the
truth
of
the
book
of
one
suggestion
more
i
would
make
to
the
readers
of
the
book
of
mormon
that
is
that
they
read
it
prayerfully
with
a
real
desire
to
know
if
it
is
of
god
if
they
will
peruse
it
with
that
desire
in
their
hearts
i
am
sanguine
that
the
spirit
of
god
which
searches
all
things
yea
the
deep
things
of
god
will
bear
witness
to
their
understanding
that
the
book
is
of
divine
origin
and
they
will
have
a
witness
from
god
of
its
truth
such
a
promise
in
fact
is
contained
within
the
book
itself
when
moroni
was
closing
up
the
sacred
record
previous
to
hiding
it
up
unto
the
lord
until
the
time
should
come
for
it
to
be
revealed
as
a
witness
for
god
he
engraved
the
following
passage
on
the
plates
as
words
of
counsel
to
those
into
whose
hands
the
record
should
fall
and
when
ye
shall
receive
these
things
the
things
written
in
the
book
of
mormon
i
would
exhort
you
that
ye
would
ask
god
the
eternal
father
in
the
name
of
christ
if
these
things
are
not
true
and
if
ye
shall
ask
with
a
sincere
heart
with
real
intent
having
faith
in
christ
he
will
manifest
the
truth
of
it
unto
you
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
ye
may
know
the
truth
of
all
things
moroni
x
here
then
is
a
means
by
which
every
person
into
whose
hands
the
book
of
mormon
falls
may
find
out
for
himself
not
from
human
testimony
not
from
the
deductions
of
logic
but
through
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
whether
the
book
of
mormon
is
of
divine
origin
or
not
this
test
must
be
final
either
for
or
against
it
to
every
individual
who
complies
with
the
conditions
enjoined
by
moroni
those
conditions
are
that
they
into
whose
hands
the
record
falls
shall
inquire
of
god
with
a
sincere
heart
with
real
intent
and
having
faith
in
christ
and
to
those
who
so
proceed
he
promises
without
equivocation
that
they
shall
receive
a
manifestation
of
its
truth
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
therefore
if
these
directions
are
complied
with
faithfully
and
honestly
and
the
manifestation
follows
not
then
they
may
know
it
is
not
of
god
if
the
manifestation
comes
of
course
the
divine
origin
of
the
book
is
confirmed
for
the
holy
ghost
would
not
confirm
by
any
manifestation
of
its
power

imposition

is

they
went
into

about
it

engaged
a
messenger
from
heaven
descended
in
a
cloud

light
and
announced
himself
to
be
john
the
same
that
is
called
the
baptist
in
the
new
testament
he
placed
his
hands
upon
the
heads
of
joseph
and
oliver
and
ordained
them
to
the
aaronic
priesthood
he
explained
that
this
priesthood
held
the
keys
of
the
ministration
of
angels
the
gospel
of
repentance
and
of
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
but
had
not
the
power
of
laying
on
hands
for
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
he
promised
them
also
that
the
priesthood
he
then
conferred
upon
them
should
never
be
taken
again
from
the
earth
until
the
sons
of
levi
offer
an
offering

stated
that
he
was
acting
under
the
direction
of
peter
james
and
john
who
held
the
keys
of
the
melchisedek
priesthood
which
he
said
would
in
due
time
be
conferred
upon
them
he
then
commanded
joseph
to
baptize
oliver
and
afterwards
oliver
to
baptize
joseph
after
their
baptism
they
were
both
filled
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
predicted
many
things
concerning
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
work
the
angel
also
commanded
them
to
each
the
other
to
the
priesthood
joseph
to
first
ordain
oliver
and
afterwards
oliver
to
ordain
joseph
to
this
commandment
they
were
obedient
and
thus

aaronic

from
god

gives
the
right
to
those
who
receive
it
to
preach
repentance
and
to

remission
of
sins
was
restored
to
men
for
a
season
doubtless
in
order
to
avoid
persecution
which
constantly
increased
in
bitterness
joseph
and
oliver
kept
their
baptism
and
ordination
to
the
aaronic
priesthood
a
secret
but
as
minds
were
wrought
upon
to
inquire
after
the
truth
they
at
last
let
it
be
known
that
they
had
received
authority
to
baptize
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
a
number
of
people
received
the
ordinance
at
their
hands
restoration
of
the
melchisedek

time
in

promise
made
by
john

conferred
the
aaronic
priesthood
upon
them
that
they
should
receive
the
higher
or
melchisedek
priesthood
was
fulfilled
this
priesthood
was
conferred
upon
them
by
peter
james
and
john
probably
in

it
is
quite
evident
from
the
prominence
given
to
these
three
apostles
in
the
new
testament
that
they
held
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
and
that
of

three
peter
was
the

be
bound
in

and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose

shall
be
loosed

was
eminently
proper

that
these
three
apostles
should
be
the
ones
to
restore
to
the
earth
the
melchisedek
priesthood

conferring
the
apostleship

did
not
undertake
to
organize
the
church
until
he
commanded
them
it
was
in
obedience
to
a
commandment
from
the
lord
therefore
that
they
appointed
the
sixth
day
of
april
as
the
time
to
organize
the
church
six
persons
who
had
been
baptized
and
a

met
at
the
house
of
peter
whitmer
in

seneca
county

to
effect
that
organization
the
meeting
was
opened
by
solemn
prayer
after
which
according
to
previous
commandment
the
prophet
joseph
called
upon
the
brethren
present
to
know
if
they
would
accept
himself
and
oliver
cowdery
as
their
teachers
in
the
things
of
the
kingdom

god

if
they
were
willing
that
they
should
proceed
to
organize
the
church
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
to
this
they
consented
by
unanimous
vote
joseph
then
ordained
oliver
an
elder
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
after
which
oliver
ordained
joseph
an
elder
of
the
said
church
the
sacrament
was
administered
and
those
who
had
been
previously
baptized
were
confirmed
members

the
church

received

holy
ghost

laying
on

enjoyed
the
gift
of

and

rejoiced
exceedingly
see
note
end
of
section
while
the
church
was
yet
assembled
a
revelation
was
received
from
the
lord
directing
that
a
record
be
kept
in
the
church
and
that
in
it
joseph
be
called
a
seer
a
translator
a
prophet
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
an
elder
of
the
church
and
the
church
was
commanded
to
give
heed
to
all
his
words
and
commandments
which
he
should
receive
from
the
lord
accepting
his
word
as
the
word
of
god
in
all
patience
and
faith
on
condition
of
their
doing
this
the
lord
promised
them
that
the
gates
of
hell
should
not
prevail
against
the
church
but
on
the
contrary
he
would
disperse
the
powers
of
darkness
from
before
them
and
shake
the
heavens
for
their
good
the
voice
of
god
and
the
voice
of
the
people
in
church
thus
the
church
was
organized
and
in
that
organization
we
see
the
operation
of
two
mighty
principles
the
voice
of
god
the
consent
of
the
people
at
the
time
that
joseph
and
oliver
received
instruction
to
ordain
each
other
to
be
elders
of
the
church
they
were
told
to
defer
their
ordination
until
such
time
as
would
be
practicable
to
get
their
brethren
who
had
been
and
who
would
be
baptized
assembled
together
for
they
must
have
the
sanction
of
their
brethren
before
they
ordained
each
other
elders
of
the
church
and
their
brethren
must
decide
by
vote
whether
they
would
accept
them
joseph
and
oliver
as
spiritual
teachers
thus
notwithstanding
joseph
and
oliver
had
been
ordained
apostles
under
the
hands
of
peter
james
and
john
and
had
doubtless
each
other
as
already
stated
yet
when
it
came
to
being
ordained
of
the
and
made
the
spiritual
leaders
of
it
it
must
be
done
by
the
common
consent
of
the
church
and
thus
early
we
see
enforced
that
law
which
says
all
things
shall
be
done
by
common
consent
in
the
church
by
much
prayer
and
faith
but
no
sooner
was
the
church
organized
than
a
prophet
a
seer
a
translator
is
appointed
and
the
church
commanded
to
give
heed
to
his
words
and
to
receive
them
as
coming
from
the
mouth
of
of
the
lord
himself
here
in
the
very
inception
of
the
church
organization
is
clearly
established
the
great
truth
the
grand
principle
that
in
the
government
of
the
church
there
is
to
be
a
union
of
the
voice
of
god
and
the
consent
or
voice
of
the
people

revelation
on
church
government
and
previous
to
the
organization
of
the
church
a
very
important
revelation
was
given
in
fact
it
was
the
revelation
which
pointed
out
the
date
on
which
the
church
was
to
be
organized
which
teaches
many
important
truths
and
points
out
the
duties
of
the
members
of
the
church
and
also
the
duties
of
the
officers
of
the
church
so
far
as
the
officers
of
the
church
at
that
time
had
been
given
that
revelation
announces
the
following
doctrines
of
the
existence
of
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
who
is
infinite
and
eternal
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
unchangeable
the
framer
of
heaven
and
earth
and
all
things
which
are
in
them
of
the
creation
and
fall
of
god
created
man
male
and
female
after
his
own
image
and
in
his
own
likeness
created
he
them
he
gave
them
commandment
that
they
should
love
and
serve
him
and
that
he
should
be
the
sole
object
of
their
worship
but
by
the
transgression
of
these
holy
laws
man
became
sensual
and
devilish
fallen
man
of
jesus
the
almighty
god
gave
his
only
begotten
son
as
a
ransom
for
fallen
man
as
it
is
written
of
him
in
the
scriptures
he
suffered
temptations
but
gave
no
heed
to
them
he
was
crucified
died
and
rose
again
the
third
day
he
ascended
into
heaven
to
sit
on
the
right
hand
of
his
father
to
reign
with
almighty
power
according
to
the
will
of
god
as
many
as
believe
on
him
and
are
baptized
in
his
holy
name
enduring
in
faith
to
the
end
shall
be
saved
not
only
those
who
believed
after
he
came
in
the
flesh
but
all
those
who
from
the
beginning
believed
in
the
words
of
the
holy
prophets
who
testified
of
him
in
all
things

the
holy
ghost

the

ghost
beareth

the

sanctification
and
it
is
for
man
to
apply
those
means
of
salvation
the
means
or
conditions
of
justification
and
sanctification
are
that
men
love
and
serve
god
with
all
their
might
mind
and
strength
that
would
lead
them
to
exercise
faith
in

repentance

baptism
for
the
remission

laying
on

for
the

and
the
pursuit
of
a
godly
life
and

the
old
conditions
of
salvation
of
falling
from
it
is
possible
for
men
to
fall
from
grace
and
depart
from
the
living
god
therefore
the
saints
are
admonished
to
take
heed
and
pray
always
least
they
fall
into
temptation
even
those
who
are
sanctified
are
cautioned
to
take
heed
of
all
who
humble
themselves
before
god
and
desire
to
be
baptized
and
come
forth
with
broken
hearts
and
contrite
spirits
and
witness
before
the
church
that
they
have
truly
repented
of
all
their
sins
and
are
willing
to
take
upon
them
the
name
of
jesus
christ
having
a
determination

serve
him
to
the
end

manifest
by
their
works
that

received

the
remission

no
person
however
can
be
received
into
the
church
of
christ
unless
he
has
arrived
unto
the
years
of
accountability
before
god
and
is
capable
of
repentance
of
the
manner
of
the
person
who
is
called
of
god
and
has
authority
from

him

shall
say
calling
him

i
baptize
you
in
the
name

immerse
him

is
performed
by

laying

is
imparted
in
the

manner

is
no
form
of
exact
words
given
so
far
as
we
know
for
confirming
persons
into
the
church
and
imparting
the
holy
ghost
but
judging
from
the
forms
given
for
baptism
administering
the
sacrament
a
simple
form
would
be
most
proper
but
whatever
other
words
are
used
the
following
should
not
be
omitted
i
confirm
you
a
member
of
the
church
of

christ

saints
and
say
unto
you
receive
ye
the
holy
ghost
those
officiating
would
of
course
be
careful
to
do
this
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ

their
administration
would
be
of
none

members

manifest
righteousness

godly
walk

conversation
to
abstain
from
ill
feeling
toward
each
other
neither
indulging
in
lying
nor
evil
speaking

is
also

pray
vocally

meet
together
often
to
partake
of
bread

into

saints
in

church
to
which
they
go
such
is
the
plan
of
government
and
discipline
contained
in
the
revelation
given
just
previous
to
the
organization
of
the
church
and
in
it
one
may
observe
the
outlines
of
that
more
complete
organization
of
the
church
which
will
be
treated
more
fully
in
another
section
the
above
was
sufficient
for
the
church
in
its
infancy
commencement
of
the
public
on
sunday
the
of
april
the
first
public
discourse
was
preached
it
was
delivered
by
elder
oliver
cowdery
at
the
house
of
peter
whitmer
in
fayette
after
the
services
six
persons
were
baptized
thus
began
the
public
ministry
of
the
church
first
miracle
in
the
in
this
same
month
of
april
the
first
miracle
in
the
church
was
performed
it
occurred
in
this
manner
the
prophet
joseph
went
on
a
visit
to
joseph
knight
at
colesville
broome
county
new
york
this
gentleman
had
rendered
the
prophet
some
timely
assistance
while
translating
the
book
of
mormon
and
he
was
anxious
that
knight
and
his
family
should
receive
the
truth
while
in
knight
neighborhood
the
prophet
held
a
number
of
meetings
among
those
who
regularly
attended
was
newel
knight
son
of
joseph
knight
he
and
the
prophet
had
many
serious
conversations
on
the
subject
of
man
salvation
in
the
meetings
held
the
people
prayed
much
and
in
one
of
the
aforesaid
conversations
with
the
prophet
newel
knight
promised
that
he
would
pray
publicly
when
the
time
came
however
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
refused
saying
that
he
would
wait
until
he
got
into
the
woods
by
himself
the
next
morning
when
he
attempted
to
pray
in
the
woods
he
was
overwhelmed
with
a
sense
of
having
neglected
his
duty
the
evening
before
in
not
praying
in
the
presence
of
others
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
and
continued
to
grow
worse
both
in
mind
and
body
until
upon
reaching
home
his
appearance
was
such
as
to
alarm
his
wife
he
sent
for
the
prophet
who
when
he
came
found
newel
in
a
sad
condition
and
suffering
greatly
his
visage
and
limbs
were
distorted
and
twisted
in
every
shape
imaginable
at
last
he
was
caught
up
off
the
floor
and
tossed
about
most
fearfully
the
neighbors
hearing
of
his
condition
came
running
in
after
he
had
suffered
for
a
time
the
prophet
succeeded
in
getting
him
by
the
hand
when
immediately
newel
spoke
to
him
saying
he
knew
he
was
possessed
of
the
devil
and
that
the
prophet
had
power
to
cast
him
out
if
you
know
i
can
it
shall
be
done
replied
the
prophet
and
then
almost
unconsciously
he
rebuked
satan
and
commanded
him
to
depart
from
the
man
immediately
newel
contortions
stopped
and
he
spoke
out
and
said
he
saw
the
devil
leave
him
and
vanish
from
sight
this
was
the
first
miracle
which
was
done
in
this
church
or
by
any
member
of
it
writes
the
prophet
and
it
was
done
not
by
man
nor
by
the
power
of
man
but
it
was
done
by
god
and
by
the
power
of
godliness
therefore
let
the
honor
and
praise
the
dominion
and
the
glory
be
ascribed
to
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
for
ever
and
ever
amen
the
first
the
first
conference
of
the
church
was
held
the
first
day
of
june
about
thirty
members
were
in
attendance
besides
a
number
of
unbaptized
believers
and
others
anxious
to
learn
the
sacrament
was
administered
a
number
who
had
been
baptized
were
confirmed
and
brethren
were
called
and
ordained
to
various
offices
of
the
priesthood
the
time
was
spent
in
prayer
singing
instruction
and
exhortation
the
holy
ghost
was
abundantly
poured
out
upon
the
saints
some
prophesied
and
others
were
wrapped
in
heavenly
vision
until
their
bodily
strength
was
exhausted
when
restored
they
shouted
hosannah
to
god
and
the
lamb
and
related
the
glorious
things
they
had
seen
and
felt
while
in
vision
see
note
end
of
section
thus
the
ministry
of
god
servants
began
to
be
confirmed
by
the
signs
and
the
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
following
those
who
believed
errors
of
the
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
the
members
of
the
church
fell
into
no
errors
some
time
in
the
summer
of
while
the
prophet
was
still
living
in
harmony
and
oliver
cowdery
was
with
the
whitmer
family
in
new
york
he
received
a
letter
from
oliver
informing
him
that
he
oliver
had
discovered
an
error
in
one
of
the
revelations
and
added
i
command
you
in
the
name
of
god
to
erase
these
words
having
named
the
passage
that
no
priestcraft
be
among
us
the
prophet
wrote
immediately
asking
by
what
authority
oliver
took
it
upon
himself
to
command
him
to
alter
or
erase
to
add
to
or
diminish
a
revelation
or
commandment
from
almighty
god
joseph
followed
his
letter
in
a
few
days
and
was
grieved
beyond
measure
to
find
that
the
whole
whitmer
family
sustained
oliver
in
the
position
he
had
taken
by
labor
and
perseverance
however
he
convinced
them
that
they
were
in
error
and
the
difficulty
was
settled
scarcely
had
this
trouble
subsided
when
another
arose
in
the
month
of
august
in
consequence
of
persecution
having
grown
extremely
bitter
in
harmony
and
vicinity
the
prophet
removed
with
his
family
to
fayette
new
york
at
the
invitation
of
the
whitmers
to
live
with
them
on
arriving
there
he
learned
that
hyrum
page
was
in
possession
of
a
stone
which
he
called
a
seer
stone
and
through
which
he
was
receiving
revelations
for
the
church
in
respect
to
the
of
zion
church
government
etc
the
whitmers
and
the
inconstant
oliver
accepted
these
revelations
and
much
harm
was
being
done
a
conference
was
to
convene
on
the
first
of
september
but
before
it
assembled
the
prophet
inquired
of
the
lord
and
obtained
a
revelation
on
the
subject
which
was
directed
more
especially
to
oliver
cowdery
in
regard
to
the
subject
in
hand
it
contained
the
following
oliver
was
to
be
heard
by
the
church
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
taught
by
the
comforter
concerning
the
revelations
and
commandments
and
if
led
by
the
comforter
to
teach
by
way
of
commandment
he
had
permission
to
do
it
but
thou
shalt
not
write
by
way
of
commandment
said
the
lord
to
him
but
by
wisdom
and
thou
shalt
not
command
him
who
is
at
thy
head
and
at
the
head
of
the
church
no
one
was
to
receive
commandments
and
revelations
in
the
church
that
is
for
the
church
except
joseph
the
prophet
for
the
lord
had
given
him
the
keys
of
the
mysteries
and
revelations
until
he
appointed
unto
the
church
another
in
his
stead
oliver
was
commanded
to
take
hyrum
page
aside
by
himself
and
tell
him
that
the
revelations
which
he
had
written
from
that
stone
were
not
of
the
lord
but
that
satan
had
deceived
him
and
they
must
be
given
up
for
he
had
not
been
appointed
to
receive
revelations
neither
would
any
one
be
appointed
contrary
to
the
church
covenants
which
provided
that
all
things
must
be
done
in
order
and
by
common
consent
of
the
church
during
the
conference
the
subject
of
the
revelations
from
hyrum
page
seer
stone
was
discussed
and
after
much
consideration
the
whole
church
including
hyrum
page
renounced
the
stone
and
all
things
connected
with
it
and
the
church
was
made
to
understand
more
clearly
that
there
is
but
one
on
the
earth
at
a
time
who
is
authorized
to
receive
the
word
and
commandment
of
the
lord
for
the
church
notes
the
visitation
of
john
the
on
a
sudden
as
from
the
midst
of
eternity
the
voice
of
the
redeemer
spake
peace
to
us
while
the
vail
was
parted
and
the
angel
of
god
came
down
clothed
with
glory
and
delivered
the
anxiously
looked
for
message
and
the
keys
of
the
gospel
of
repentance
what
joy
what
wonder
what
amazement
while
the
world
was
racked
and
distracted
while
millions
were
groping
as
the
blind
for
the
wall
and
while
all
men
were
resting
on
uncertainty
as
a
general
mass
our
eyes
beheld
our
ears
heard
as
in
the
blaze
of
day
yes
more
above
the
glitter
of
the
may
sunbeam
which
then
shed
its
brilliancy
over
the
face
of
nature
then
this
voice
though
mild
pierced
to
the
center
and
his
words
i
am
thy
fellow
servant
dispelled
every
fear
we
listened
we
gazed
we
admired
was
the
voice
of
an
angel
from
glory
was
a
message
from
the
most
high
and
as
we
heard
we
rejoiced
while
his
love
enkindled
upon
our
souls
and
we
were
wrapped
in
the
vision
of
the
almighty
where
was
room
for
doubt
nowhere
uncertainty
had
fled
doubt
had
sunk
more
more
to
rise
while
fiction
and
deception
had
fled
forever
think
for
a
moment
what
joy
filled
our
hearts
and
with
what
surprise
we
must
have
bowed
for
who
would
not
have
bowed
the
knee
for
such
a
blessing
when
we
received
under
his
hand
the
holy
priesthood
as
he
said
upon
you
my
fellow
servants
in
the
name
of
messiah
i
confer
this
priesthood
and
this
authority
which
shall
remain
upon
the
earth
that
the
sons
of
levi
may
yet
offer
an
offering
to
the
lord
in
righteousness
oliver
cowdery
melchisedek
priesthood
we
can
not
fix
the
exact
date
when
this
priesthood
was
restored
but
it
occurred
sometime
between
the
of
may
and
the
of
april
we
can
approximate
within
a
few
months
of
the
exact
time
but
no
further
from
any
of
the
records
of
the
church
joseph
the
prophet
designates
the
place
where
their
ordination
took
place
in
his
address
to
the
saints
written
september
as
follows
again
what
do
we
hear
the
voice
of
peter
james
and
john
in
the
wilderness
between
harmony
susquehanna
county
and
colesville
broome
county
on
the
susquehanna
river
declaring
themselves
as
possessing
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
and
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
and
in
a
revelation
given
september
referring
to
joseph
and
oliver
the
lord
said
in
reference
to
partaking
again
of
the
sacrament
on
the
earth
that
the
hour
cometh
that
i
will
drink
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
with
you
on
the
earth
and
with
moroni
and
also
with
elias
and
also
with
john
the
son
of
zacharias
and
also
with
peter
james
and
john

i
have
sent
unto
you
by
whom
i
have
ordained
you
and
confirmed
you
apostles
and
especial
witnesses
of
my
name
it
would
appear
from
the
instructions
given
in
the
revelation
dated
june
doc
and
cov
sec
xviii
that
the
apostleship
had
been
conferred
on
joseph
smith
oliver
cowdery
and
david
whitmer
if
this
supposition
is
correct
it
reduces
the
period
of
uncertainty
when
this
glorious
event
actually
took
place
to
a
few
weeks
or
from
the
middle
of

why
the
higher
priesthood
is
called
after
there
are
in
the
church
two
priesthoods
why
the
first
is
called
the
melchisedek
priesthood
is
because
melchisedek
was
such
a
great
high
priest
before
his
day
it
was
called
the
holy
priesthood
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
but
out
of
respect
or
deference
to
the
name
of
the
supreme
being
to
avoid
the
too
frequent
repetition
of
his
name
they
the
church
in
ancient
days
called
that
priesthood
after

newel
knight
who
was
so
completely
overcome
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
that
he
had
to
be
laid
on
a
bed
being
unable
to
help
himself
by
his
own
account
of
the
transaction
says
the
prophet
he
could
not
understand
why
we
should
lay
him
on
the
bed
as
he
felt
no
sensibility
of
weakness
he
felt
his
heart
filled
with
love
with
glory
and
pleasure
unspeakable
and
could
discern
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
room
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
vision
of
futurity
burst
upon
him
he
saw
there
represented
the
great
work
which
through
my
instrumentality
was
yet
to
be
accomplished
he
saw
heaven
opened
and
beheld
the
lord
jesus
christ
seated
on
the
right
hand
of
the
majesty
on
high
and
had
it
made
plain
to
his
understanding
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
would
be
admitted
into
his
presence
to
enjoy
his
society

ever

ever

the
circumstances
which
led
to
the
restoration
of

the

a
desire

imitate

led

the

law
i
the
person
desiring
to
make
the
consecration
brings
his
possessions
to
the
bishop

delivers
them
unto
him
consecrates
them
unto
the
lord
giving
them
up
absolutely
with
a
deed
and
a
covenant
that
can
not
be
broken
ii
the
person
so
consecrating
his
possessions
whether
they
be
much
or
little
if
it
be
a
full
consecration
has
claim
upon
the
bishop
for
stewardship
out

given

law

the

are

upon

the
law
is
designated
to
humble
the
rich
and
the
proud
and
raise
the
poor
and
the
lowly
that
men
might
be
equal
in
temporal
possessions
according
to

their
circumstances
their
wants

there
is
enough
in
the
earth
and
more
than
enough
to
supply
the
necessities
and
the
reasonable
luxuries
desired
by
man
if
the
wealth
created
by
his
industry
was
but
more
equally
distributed
the
plan
which
the
lord
has
revealed
to
accomplish
this
however
does
not
aim
at
the
destruction
of
the
individuality
of
men
it
makes
no
attempt
to
control
men
in
the
detail
management
of
their
stewardships
or
the
disposal
of
their
time
or
to
set
taskmasters
over

but
only
to
control
and
dispose
of
the
surplus
arising
from
their
labors
in
the
management
of
their
respective
stewardships
in
consequence
of
the
unsettled
state
of
the
church
arising
from
the
persecutions
and
drivings
inflicted
upon
the
saints
during
the
time
they
were
settling
in
missouri
coupled
with
their
inexperience
their
pride
covetousness
greed
and
disobedience
they
failed
to
live
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
law
of
consecration
and
in
the
lesser
law
of
tithing
was
given
and
has
obtained
in
the
church
unto
this
day
this
law
of
tithing
requires
that
the
saints
pay
first
their
surplus
property
to
the
bishop
and
after
that
those
who
have
been
so
tithed
shall
pay
of
their
income
annually

they
were
inclined
to
be

an

matter

for

the
prophet
joseph
to
gather
up
the
strength
of
the
lord
house
the
young
and
men
in
the
church
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
the
assistance
of
their
brethren
in
missouri
and
to
redeem
zion
in
the
spring
of
therefore
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
brethren
from
the
churches
in
the
eastern
states
assembled
at
new
portage
ohio
about
fifty
miles
from
kirtland
and
this
number
was
increased
to
about
two
hundred
by
the
time
the
camp
reached
missouri
they
took
with
them
money
to
purchase
lands
food
and
clothing
to
assist
their
destitute
brethren
and
it
was
also
the
determination
of
the
camp
to
help
their
exiled
friends
maintain
their
possessions
when
the
governor
of
missouri
them
upon
their
lands
but
en
route
to
missouri
the
brethren
did
not
live
up
to
the
requirement
made
of
the
camp
some
of
them
were
disobedient
even
rebellious
towards
the
prophet
and
the
lord
was
not
well
pleased
with
them
as
the
camp
approached
jackson
county
it
was
met
by
delegations
inquiring
into
their
designs
for
approaching
jackson
county
various
reports
had
been
spread
abroad
in
respect
to
their
intentions
and
some
of
them
were
of
a
character
to
create
alarm
in
order
to
correct
these
false
reports
the
brethren
made
the
following
statement
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
our
intention
to
commit
hostilities
against
any
man
or
set
of
men
it
is
not
our
intention
to
injure
any
man
person
or
property
except
in
defending
ourselves
it
is
our
intention
to
go
back
upon
our
lands
in
jackson
county
by
order
of
the
executive
of
the
state
if
possible
we
have
brought
our
arms
with
us
for
the
purpose
of
as
it
is
well
known
to
almost
every
man
of
the
state
we
have
every
reason
to
put
ourselves
in
an
attitude
of
defense
considering
the
abuse
we
have
suffered
in
jackson
county
we
are
anxious
for
a
settlement
of
the
difficulties
existing
between
us
upon
honorable
and
constitutional
principles
the
brethren
also
made
a
proposition
to
submit
their
losses
to
a
committee
of
impartial
arbitrators
and
another
to
buy
out
those
of
the
old
settlers
who
could
not
live
with
them
but
before
matters
were
brought
to
an
investigation
and
adjustment
the
lord
in
a
revelation
to
the
prophet
gave
instructions
which
led
to
the
abandonment
of
any
attempt
at
that
time
to
redeem
zion
the
lord
in
this
revelation
declared
that
zion
might
have
been
redeemed
by
that
time
had
it
not
been
for
the
transgressions
of
his
saints
they
had
not
been
obedient
to
the
requirements
made
of
them
they
had
withheld
their
means
and
in
their
hearts
had
said
concerning
the
saints
in
zion
where
is
their
god
behold
he
will
deliver
them
in
time
of
trouble
otherwise
we
will
not
go
up
unto
zion
and
we
will
keep
our
moneys
besides
these
evidences
of
a
want
of
faith
they
lacked
that
unity
required
by
the
law
of
the
celestial
kingdom
and
it
is
only
through
the
observance
of
that
law
that
zion
can
be
redeemed
the
lord
therefore
commanded
the
elders
to
wait
a
season
for
the
redemption
of
zion
until
the
saints
should
obtain
more
experience
learn
obedience
and
until
means
could
be
raised
to
purchase
all
the
lands
in
jackson
county
that
could
be
purchased
and
also
in
the
surrounding
counties
and
until
the
lord
army
had
become
very
great
and
sanctified
before
him
and
when
this
was
done
the
lord
promised
to
hold
his
people
guiltless
in
taking
possession
of
that
which
was
their
own
and
they
should
possess
it
forever
he
had
permitted
the
elders
composing
the
camp
to
come
thus
far
for
a
trial
of
their
faith
and
now
he
had
prepared
a
great
endowment
for
them
in
the
house
which
he
had
commanded
to
be
built
in
kirtland
those
who
could
stay
in
missouri
were
to
do
so
but
those
who
had
left
their
families
in
the
east
were
at
liberty
to
return
in
obedience
to
the
commandment
to
await
for
a
season
the
redemption
of
zion
the
camp
of
zion
was
disbanded
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
june
a
number
remained
in
missouri
but
the
most
of
the
camp
returned
to
the
east
relieved
now
of
the
immediate
responsibility
of
redeeming
zion
the
brethren
who
returned
from
missouri
and
the
churches
in
the
east
devoted
their
attention
to
building
up
kirtland
as
a
stake
of
zion
and
completing
the
temple
the
foundation
of
which
had
been
laid
about
a
year
before
the
declaration
of
the
lord
in
that
revelation
given
on
fishing
river
missouri
to
the
effect
that
he
had
prepared
a
great
endowment
for
the
faithful
elders
in
the
house
which
he
had
commanded
them
to
build
in
kirtland
hastened
the
work
as
they
were
anxious
to
receive
those
spiritual
blessings
high
meantime
the
lord
had
given
many
important
revelations
in
respect
to
the
priesthood
and
the
organization
of
the
church
in
february
a
few
months
previous
to
camp
starting
for
missouri
the
first
high
council
of
the
church
was
organized
this
council
was
appointed
by
revelation
for
the
purpose
of
settling
important
difficulties
that
might
arise
in
the
church
and
which
could
not
be
settled
in
the
bishops
courts
to
the
satisfaction
of

parties
the
high

is
composed
of
twelve
high

presided
over
by
one

three
presidents
as
circumstances
may
determine
the
high

the

their
case

its
righteousness
or

on
the
contrary
every
man
is
to
speak
according
to
equity
and
truth
and
aside
from

merely
to
see
that

organization
of
the

as
early
as
june
the

revealed
that
there
would
be
twelve
especial
witnesses
or
apostles
called
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
nations
of
the
earth
but
it
was
not
until
several
months
after
the
prophet
returned
from
the
zion
camp
expedition
that
such
a
quorum
was
organized
in
the
month
of
february
however
a
general
conference
was
called
and
the
three
especial
witnesses
to
the
book
of
mormon
selected
the
men
under
the
inspiration
of
the
holy
ghost
for
they
were
appointed
to
that
mission
by

who
were
to
constitute

quorum

in
the
same
month
february
the
first
quorum
of
seventies
was
organized
by
the
prophet
joseph
and
his
two
counselors
and
others
shortly
afterwards
the
second
quorum
was
also
organized
these
quorums
as
would
be
inferred
from
their
being
called
seventies
quorums
consist
of
seventy
men
seven
presidents
preside
over
each
quorum
and
the
first
seven
presidents
the
presidents
of
the
first
quorum
preside
over
all
the
quorums
of
seventy
in
the
church
about
a
month
after
the
organization
of
these
quorums
of
march
a
revelation
was
given
in
which
the
duties
of
the
apostles
and
seventies
are
made
clear
as
well
as
the
duties
of
other
officers
we
have
now
however
reached
a
point
in
the
historical
development
of
the
church
of
christ
where
we
can
consider
it
as
a
system
of
ecclesiastical
government
and
to
that
consideration
the
next
section
is
devoted
notes
character
of
the
old
settlers
in
jackson
speaking
of
his
arrival
in
independence
and
meeting
with
oliver
cowdery
and
other
brethren
there
the
prophet
joseph
says
it
seemed
good
and
pleasant
for
brethren
to
meet
together
in
unity
but
our
reflections
were
great
coming
as
we
had
from
a
highly
cultivated
state
of
society
in
the
east
and
standing
now
upon
the
confines
and
western
limits
of
the
united
states
and
looking
into
the
vast
wilderness
of
those
that
sat
in
darkness
how
natural
it
was
to
observe
the
degradation
leanness
of
intellect
ferocity
and
jealousy
of
a
people
that
were
nearly
a
century
behind
the
time
and
to
feel
for
those
who
roamed
about
without
the
benefit
of
civilization
refinement
or
religion
yea
and
to
exclaim
in
the
language
of
the
prophets
will
the
wilderness
blossom
as
a
rose
when
will
zion
be
built
up
in
her
glory
and
where
will
thy
temple
stand
unto
which
all
nations
shall
come

month
of

month

expulsion
of
twelve
hundred
american
citizens
from

they
had
purchased
from

the
events
of

branded
the
sovereign

with
an
infamy
that
will
cling
to
her
as
long
as
the
name
is
remembered
on
earth
or
in
heaven
and
when
her
officials
of
that
period
shall
stand
before
the
bar
of

gouts
of
blood
will
be
found
on
their
ministerial
vestments
it
will
be
the
stain
too
of
innocent
blood
early
in
the
spring
the
mob
burned
the
houses
belonging
to

saints
according
to

hear

and
in
what
manner
were
the
members
of
this
quorum
selected
when
were
seventies
quorums
first
organized
state
what
you
can
concerning
the
presidency
of
the
quorums
section
priesthood
is
power
which
god
gives
to
man
by
which
man
becomes
an
agent
of
god
an
authorized
officer
in
his
kingdom
with
the
right
and
power
to
teach
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
and
administer
the
ordinances
by
which
foreigners
and
aliens
are
admitted
to
citizenship
it
gives
man
the
right
and
power
to
act
in
stead
thus
if
a
man
endowed
with
the
proper
degree
of
the
priesthood
takes
one
who
believes
the
gospel
and
baptizes
him
for
the
remission
of
sins
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
the
act
of
that
authorized
servant
of
god
is
just
as
valid
as
if
the
lord
jesus
christ
himself
did
it
and
remission
of
sins
will
follow
so
also
if
an
authorized
servant
of
god
lays
on
hands
to
impart
the
holy
ghost
the
holy
ghost
will
be
given
inasmuch
as
all
is
done
as
the
law
of
the
lord
directs
so
in
preaching
exhorting
warning
whether
it
be
by
god
own
voice
or
the
voice
of
his
servants
it
is
the
same
man
through
receiving
the
priesthood
becomes
god
agent
and
the
lord
is
bound
to
recognize
the
ministrations
of
his
agents
so
long
as
they
act
in
accordance
with
the
terms
by
which
they
hold
that
agency
such
is
priesthood
spirit
of
government
by
the
the
government
of
the
priesthood
is
exercised
through
the
channels
of
love
knowledge
and
righteousness
the
rights
of
the
priesthood
are
inseparably
connected
with
the
powers
of
heaven
and
the
powers
of
heaven
can
only
be
controlled
upon
the
principles
of
righteousness
no
power
can
or
ought
to
be
maintained
by
virtue
of
the
priesthood
only
by
persuasion
by
by
gentleness
and
meekness
and
by
love
unfeigned
by
kindness
and
pure
knowledge
which
shall
greatly
enlarge
the
soul
without
hypocrisy
and
without
guile
reproving
betimes
with
sharpness
when
moved
upon
by
the
holy
ghost
and
then
showing
forth
afterwards
an
increase
of
love
lest
those
reproved
esteem
those
reproving
as
enemies
such
is
the
spirit
of
government
under
the
priesthood
it
may
be
summed
up
in
this
men
are
to
be
taught
correct
principles
and
then
govern
themselves
the
from
the
gospel
and
the
priesthood
comes
the
church
the
church
is
the
medium
through
which
the
gospel
is
promulgated
by
which
it
is
made
known
among
the
children
of
men
it
is
the
system
of
government
by
which
those
who
accept
the
gospel
are
controlled
in
things
religious
it
is
the
government
of
god
on
earth
pertaining
to
religious
affairs
the
lord
had
clothed
it
with
his
authority
which
is
his
power
and
it
hath
authority
not
only
to
teach
the
gospel
but
to
execute
its
laws
and
inflict
the
penalties
attached
to
a
violation
thereof
at
least
so
far
as
dealing
with
the
membership
of
trangressors
is
concerned
as
for
other
penalties
that
will
fall
upon
the
violators
of
divine
law
the
father
hath
reserved
that
to
himself
and
will
in
his
own
time
and
way
vindicate
his
own
laws
having
due
regard
to
the
relative
claims
of
justice
and
mercy
the
authority
of
the
church
comes
from
the
priesthood
and
may
be
said
to
be
the
collected
authority
of
all
the
quorums
of
the
priesthood
combined
the
aggregation
of
god
authority
in
the
earth
in
relation
to
things
religious
such
is
the
church
divisions
of
the
in
the
church
of
christ
there
are
two
grand
divisions
of
priesthood
or
rather
its
powers
are
grouped
under
two
great
heads
for
all
priesthood
comes
from
god
is
power
from
him
and
therefore
can
not
properly
be
regarded
as
two
different
priesthoods
the
two
divisions
of
priesthood
are
named
respectively
the
melchisedek
priesthood
and
the
aaronic
priesthood
the
melchisedek
priesthood

more
especially
in

it
holds
the
keys
of
all
the

entitled
to
receive
the

of
the

of

with
the

and
enjoy
the
communion
and
presence
of
god
the
father
and
his
son
jesus

the
aaronic
priesthood
ministers
more
especially
in
temporal
things
it
holds
the
keys

of

the

they
are

as
they
may
be
designated
unto
them
by

it
is
the
duty
of
the
twelve
also
to
ordain
and
set
in
order
all
other
officers
in
the
church
these
twelve
apostles
form
the
second
general
presiding
quorum
in
the
church
and
are
equal
in
authority
and

to
the
quorum
of

the

this

the
quorum
of
the
twelve
apostles
in
addition
to
presiding
over
the
first
quorum
of
seventy
to
which
quorum
they
belong
the
first
seven
presidents
were
authorized
in
the
beginning
to
choose
other
seventy
besides
the
first
until
seven
times
seventy
had
been
chosen
if
the
labor
in
the
ministry
required
it
and
preside
over
them
each
quorum
has
its
council
of
seven
presidents
but
the
first
seven
presidents
preside
over
all
these
quorums
and
all
their
presidents
the
seventies
are
special
witnesses
for
the
lord
in
all
the
world
and
are
especially
chosen
to
preach
the
gospel
abroad
the
responsibility
of
declaring
the
great
message
of
god
unto
the
world
rests
upon
them
particularly
laboring
of
course
under
the
direction
of
the
twelve
and
the
twelve
are
to
call
upon
the
seventy
in
preference
to
any
others
when
they
have
need
of
assistance
to
fill
the
calls
for
preaching
and
administering
the
gospel
we
have
spoken
of
these
three
quorums
being
equal
in
authority
but
every
decision
made
by
either
of
them
in
order
to
make
such
decision
of
the
same
power
or
validity
one
with
the
other
must
be
by
unanimous
voice
of
the
respective
quorums
that
is
every
member
in
each
quorum
must
be
agreed
to
its
decisions
or
such
decisions
are
not
entitled
to
the
same
blessings
as
the
decisions
of
the
quorum
of
the
first
presidency
when
circumstances
render
it
impossible
to
be
otherwise
a
majority
may
form
a
quorum
the
decisions
of
these
quorums
of
course
are
to
be
made
in
righteousness
in
holiness
and
lowliness
of
heart
if
so
made
there
is
no
appeal
from
their
decision
but
in
case
that
any
decision
of
these
quorums
is
made
in
unrighteousness
it
may
then
be
brought
before
a
general
assembly
of
the
several
quorums
of
the
priesthood
which
constitute
the
spiritual
authorities
of
the
church
these
officers
hold
the
keys
of
blessings
in
the
church
the
order
of
this
priesthood
was
confirmed
to
be
handed
down
from
father
to
son
and
rightly
belongs
to
the
literal
descendants
of
the
chosen
seed
to
whom
the
promises
were
made
there
is
one
general
and
a
number
of
local
patriarchs
in
the
church
the
first
is
patriarch
to
the
whole
church
and
he
may
minister
in
any
branch
or
stake
in
it
his
jurisdiction
in
blessing
the
people
being
with
the
church
he
holds
the
keys
of
the
patriarchal
blessings
upon
the
heads
of
all
the
lord
people
and
whomsoever
he
blesses
shall
be
blessed
and
whomsoever
he
curses
shall
be
cursed
and
whatsoever
he
binds
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
he
looses
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
he
holds
the
sealing
blessings
of
the
church
even
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
whereby
men
are
sealed
up
unto
the
day
of
redemption
that
they
may
not
fall
notwithstanding
the
hour
of
temptation
that
may
come
upon
them
the
local
patriarchs
referred
to
above
are
patriarchs
appointed
and
ordained
by
the
apostles
to
hold
and
exercise
the
powers
of
giving
patriarchal
blessings
to
the
saints
within
the
branches
and
stakes
of
zion
in
which
they
are
appointed
to
minister
in
this
calling
but
they
are
not
to
minister
outside
of
their
respective
districts
hence
they
call
them
local
patriarchs
they
possess
the
same
powers
in
blessing
within
the
district
where
they
are
appointed
to
labor
as
the
general
patriarch
of
the
church
does
in
his
wider
sphere
high
the
quorums
of
high
priests
are
designed
to
qualify
those
who
shall
be
appointed
standing
presidents
over
different
stakes
in
zion
and
abroad
they
may
travel
and
preach
the
gospel
if
they
choose
for
high
priests
have
power
to
preach
and
administer
all
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
but
their
calling
is
more
especially
to
preside
to
them
belongs
the
sphere
of
presidency
of
government
in
the
church
from
these
quorums
so
far
as
the
most
suitable
men
can
be
found
in
them
are
chosen
men
to
act
as
bishops
where
no
literal
descendant
of
aaron
can
be
found
the
bishops
counselors
presidents
of
stakes
and
their
counselors
and
also
high
counselors
when
men
more
suitable
for
these
positions
are
found
in
other
quorums
of
the
priesthood
then
they
are
ordained
high
priests
and
appointed
to
the
presiding
positions
enumerated
in
every
stake
there
is
a
high
quorum
presided
over
by
a
president
and
two
counselors
there
is
no
specific
number
necessary
to
form
a
quorum
of
high
priests
the
quorum
includes
all
high
priests
within
a
stake
or
branch
where
it
exists
be
they
many
or
few
the
quorum
organization
is
for
convenience
for
discipline
and
for
training
its
members
in
the
art
of
government
since
to
the
high
priests
belongs
the
sphere
of
government
we
know
of
no
position
in
the
church
which
calls
for
higher
qualities
of
heart
and
mind
than
that
of
high
priests
it
is
an
office
that
requires
the
combination
of
wisdom
and
executive
ability
a
combination
the
rarest
among
men
the
world
has
had
untold
thousands
of
learned
men
and
orators
and
multitudes
of
men
with
special
great
gifts
but
it
has
had
comparatively
few
blessed
with
that
combination
of
gifts
which
makes
men
successful
rulers
and
yet
those
qualities
which
make
men
rulers
are
the
qualities
to
be
looked
for
and
developed

they
are

are

from

as
circumstances
may
require
presidencies
in

the

already
remarked
has

with

the

the

the

are

as
the
office
of
elder

bishop
are
appendages
to
the
melchisedek
priesthood
what
is
meant
by
appendage
to
the
priesthood
is
an
addition
to
the
regular
quorums
of
the
priesthood
when
so
added
they
become
part
of
the
organization
but
in
a

way
then

called
upon

officiate
in
their
stead
when
there

present

when
the
high
priest
is
present
the
elder
has
no
right
to
act
in
his
stead
unless
called
upon
the
teacher
may
assist
the
priest
in
his
duties
as
the
deacon
may
assist
the

in
his
duty
but
in
that
event
the
lesser
quorums
act
in
subordination
to
the
ones
they
are

assist
they
were
quorums
added
to
the

of

when
the

were
so
multiplied
that
the
higher
and
regular
quorums
could
not
discharge
them
by
creating
these
appendages
to
the
priesthood
men
could
be
called
into

whose
wisdom
and
experience
would
not

placing

all

quorums
the
bishopric
of
a
ward
like
the
bishopric
of
the
church
has
to
do
chiefly
with
temporal
affairs
but
in
nearly
all
cases
in
fact
so
far
as
we
know
in
all
cases
at
present
in
the
church
the
bishops
are
high
priests
acting
in
that
capacity
and
since
in
acting
as
bishops
they
do
not
lose
their
position
as
high
priests
they
have
a
right
to
minister
in
both
temporal
and
spiritual
affairs
it
may
be
well
to
remark
however
in
passing
that
wherein
bishops
do
take
the
lead
in
spiritual
concerns
they
do
it
by
virtue
of
the
high
priesthood
which
they
hold
which
is
the
proper
authority
to
act
in
spiritual
matters
the
ward
officers
consist
of
a
quorum
of
priests
of
teachers
and
of
deacons
their
powers
and
duties
have
already
been
explained
they
labor
under
the
direction
of
the
bishop
and
are
the
standing
ministers
within
the
ward
to
be
with
and
watch
over
the
church
to
see
that
each
member
thereof
does
his
duty
and
that
no
iniquity
is
allowed
to
creep
into
the
church
to
corrupt
it
at
present
in
many
wards
there
are
not
enough
men
to
fill
up
the
quorums
of
the
lesser
priesthood
and
members
of
the
high
priesthood
are
frequently
found
officiating
as
teachers
etc
each
ward
is
divided
up
into
teachers
districts
and
two
teachers
appointed
to
take
charge
of
each
district
and
visit
every
family
and
member
within
it
to
see
that
all
are
doing
their
duty
that
they
live
so
far
as
may
be
in
peace
with
all
men
that
they
are
prayerful
diligent
in
attending
public
worship
and
that
they
are
honest
sober
and
hold
no
hardness
against
their
neighbors
branches
are
organizations
established
chiefly
out
in
the
world
where
there
are
no
regularly
organized
stakes
the
elders
while
abroad
on
missions
in
order
to
preserve
in
the
faith
those
who
receive
the
gospel
organize
branches
set
apart
elders
or
priests
to
preside
and
also
ordain
as
many
other
elders
priests
teachers
and
deacons
to
assist
the
president
of
the
branch
as
may
be
deemed
necessary
these
officers
discharge
the
same
duties
in
a
branch
that
they
would
in
a
fully
organized
ward
branches
are
also
sometimes
organized
in
outlying
districts
of
large
wards
where
there
are
not
enough
people
to
justify
a
complete
ward
organization
and
yet
the
district
is
too
far
removed
from
the
ward
to
permit
the
members
living
there
to
enjoy
the
advantages
of
the
adjacent
ward
organization
in
such
an
event
the
branch
is
usually
placed
under
the
care
of
the
neighboring
ward
helps
in
in
addition
to
these
regular
and
direct
means
of
ecclesiastical
government
in
the
church
there
are
also
helps
in
government
or
appendages
to
the
church
organization
the
chief
of
these
are
female
relief
a
woman
association
organized
in
each
ward
to
relieve
the
poor
in
their
distress
and
visit
the
sick
and
afflicted
sunday
in
every
ward
also
is
a
sunday
school
in
which
the
young
are
taught
in
the
gospel
and
educated
in
church
discipline
and
in
nearly
all
wards
also
are
young
men
and
young
ladies
mutual
improvement
associations
for
the
instruction
of
the
young
in
theology
science
history
and
literature
and
in
fact
in
all
things
that
tend
to
the
development
and
refinement
of
the
mind
of
man
but
the
main
object
of
these
organizations
is
to
establish
the
young
of
both
sexes
in
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
primary
primary
associations
are
ward
organizations
for
juveniles
too
young
to
be
connected
with
the
improvement
associations
and
were
established
to
train
the
young
in
such
moral
precepts
and
conduct
as
are
suitable
to
their
years
the
church
judiciary
so
long
as
men
are
imperfect
just
so
long
will
difficulties
and
misunderstandings
arise
among
them
and
these
things
will
beget
bitterness
of
feeling
enmities
and
animosities
unbecoming
those
striving
to
be
saints
and
hence
the
church
must
be
purged
of
these
things
moreover
although
man
by
nature
is
a
religious
creature
he
is
prone
to
be
forgetful
of
religious
duty
and
unless
a
wholesome
church
discipline
be
enforced
he
is
liable
to
become
neglectful
of
his
religious
obligations
to
settle
difficulties
then
which
may
arise
between
members
on
the
one
hand
and
to
enforce
church
discipline
on
the
other
there
exists
in
the
church
an
ecclesiastical
judiciary
system
that
is
most
admirably
adapted
to
answer
the
purposes
for
which
it
exists
first
as
to
the
settlement
of
difficulties
arising
between
members
of
the
church
the
law
of
the
lord
requires
that
if
a
brother
or
sister
offend
another
the
one
offended
should
go
alone
to
the
one
who
gave
offense
and
tell
him
his
fault
if
he
repents
and
seeks
forgiveness
and
makes
restitution
then
the
one
offended
must
forgive
his
brother
and
become
reconciled
in
the
event
of
the
offender
being
stubborn
and
impenitent
or
maintaining
that
he
has
done
no
wrong
then
the
one
aggrieved
should
take
others
with
him
one
or
more
and
in
their
presence
and
with
whatever
assistance
they
can
render
seek
justice
of
and
reconciliation
with
his
brother
if
the
offender
refuse
to
make
restitution
and
reconciliation
then
the
matter
may
be
taken
to
the
bishop
court
for
settlement
here
the
matter
is
put
on
trial
the
statements
of
the
respective
parties
received
and
the
testimony
of
witnesses
admitted
and
a
decision
rendered
by
the
bishop
according
to
his
understanding
of
the
case
in
the
event
of
either
party
being
dissatisfied
with
the
bishop
decision
they
may
appeal
to
the
high
council
of
the
stake
but
if
dissatisfied
parties
neither
take
an
appeal
to
the
high
council
nor
comply
with
the
bishop
decision
then
they
stand
in
danger
of
losing
their
fellowship
in
the
church
for
if
men
will
not
respect
the
decisions
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
then
the
officers
thereof
must
vindicate
their
decrees
and
make
the
courts
respected
by
punishing
those
who
would
treat
them
with
contempt
if
the
case
be
appealed
to
the
high
council
of
the
stake
it
is
heard
on
its
merits
in
the
manner
already
described
in
section
four
of
this
part
under
the
caption
high
councils
which
see
the
parties
or
either
of
them
may
appeal
to
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
who
will
direct
in
what
manner
the
case
shall
be
disposed
of
but
the
parties
must
abide
that
decision
or
lose
their
standing
in
the
church
now
as
to
those
who
neglect
their
duties
who
do
not
so
much
offend
against
individuals
as
against
the
church
by
failing
to
live
up
to
the
regulations
it
prescribes
for
its
members
it
is
especially
the
duty
of
the
teachers
priests
and
bishopric
to
labor
very
assiduously
to
preserve
their
people
in
the
faith
and
by
patient
watchfulness
by
teaching
and
admonition
by
warning
and
reproof
when
necessary
keep
alive
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
in
the
hearts
of
the
saints
if
however
in
spite
of
all
these
efforts
to
preserve
the
church
members
in
an
active
performance
of
their
duties
men
will
grow
careless
and
transgress
the
law
of
the
lord
they
are
amenable
to
the
church
courts
and
may
be
tried
for
their
fellowship
in
that
case
they
would
have
the
same
rights
in
the
courts
and
the
same
rights
to
appeal
as
in
the
case
of
difficulty
between
members
the
only
real
punishment
which
is
within
the
power
of
the
church
to
inflict
is
to
disfellowship
or
excommunicate
its
members
in
the
former
case
the
offender
is
merely
suspended
from
the
privileges
of
church
communion
this
punishment
may
be
inflicted
by
the
bishop
until
satisfaction
is
made
by
the
offender
in
the
latter
case
excommunication
the
person
absolutely
loses
his
membership
in
the
church
together
with
all
the
priesthood
he
holds
and
if
he
ever
regains
a
standing
it
will
be
by
baptism
and
confirmation
as
at
the
first
of
course
to
those
who
hold
lightly
their
standing
in
the
church
suspension
of
fellowship
or
excommunication
has
no
especial
terror
but
to
the
man
of
faith
whose
full
hopes
of
eternal
life
with
all
its
advantages
stand
or
fall
with
his
standing
in
the
church
of
christ
no
greater
punishment
can
threaten
him
he
remembers
that
the
lord
hath
said
wo
unto
them
who
are
cut
off
from
my
church
for
the
same
are
overcome
of
the
world
and
again
inasmuch
as
ye
are
cut
off
by
transgressions
ye
can
not
escape
the
buffetings
of
satan
until
the
day
of
redemption
the
punishment
then
of
excommunication
is
a
serious
one
in
the
estimation
of
the
faithful
and
since
man
in
his
imperfect
state
is
influenced
to
righteousness
by
his
fear
of
punishment
as
well
as
by
his
hope
of
reward
the
punishment
of
excommunication
has
a
wholesome
effect
in
preserving
the
discipline
of
the
church
conferences
of
the
there
are
two
general
conferences
of
the
church
each
year
one
convening
on
the
of
april
and
the
other
on
the
of
october
conferences
are
convened
every
three
months
in
all
the
stakes
of
zion
and
in
the
respective
wards
once
a
year
the
chief
purposes
of
holding
these
conferences
aside
from
the
giving
of
instructions
by
the
general
authorities
who
are
usually
present
is
to
sustain
by
vote
the
officers
of
the
church
the
principle
of
common
consent
operating
in
the
church
government
has
already
been
explained
and
it
only
remains
to
say
that
the
means
by
which
this
common
consent
is
expressed
voting
to
sustain
those
proposed
for
the
several
offices
virtually
amounts
to
an
election
the
elective
principle
in
government
or
in
societies
is
not
only
carried
out
by
direct
means
it
may
be
carried
out
by
indirect
means
it
is
just
as
much
a
fact
under
the
form
of
popular
acceptance
as
of
popular
choice
it
is
in
the
form
of
popular
acceptance
that
the
elective
principle
exists
in
the
church
if
a
good
system
for
the
organization
and
administration
of
authority
and
an
equally
good
system
for
the
security
of
liberty
is
the
test
of
a
good
plan
of
government
then
this
ecclesiastical
government
we
have
described
must
be
recognized
as
of
the
very
highest
order
it
is
elaborate
in
organization
but
simple
in
its
operations
there
is
in
it
a
most
excellent
assemblage
of
means
to
transmit
the
will
of
the
central
power
into
all
departments
of
the
society
and
on
the
other
hand
an
equally
efficient
assemblage
of
means
for
transmitting
the
response
of
the
society
to
the
central
organized
power
and
as
the
whole
government
exists
by
the
common
consent
of
the
church
members
and
elections
by
popular
acceptance
are
frequent
the
liberties
of
the
people
composing
the
church
are
secured
where
these
facts
exist
the
highest
order
of
government
must
result
and
we
may
say
in
conclusion
that
the
formation
of
a
free
ecclesiastical
government
on
so
extensive
a
scale
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
problems
of
humanity
it
requires
such
refined
prudence
to
form
such
a
government
such
comprehensive
knowledge
and
such
perspicacious
sagacity
united
with
such
almost
illimitable
powers
of
combination
that
it
is
nearly
in
vain
to
hope
for
qualities
so
rare
to
be
congregated
in
a
solitary
mind
indeed
it
is
in
vain
to
hope
for
these
powers
in
an
uninspired
mind
it
is
a
task
too
difficult
for
mere
human
ingenuity
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
joseph
smith
knowledge
of
government
and
history
in
his
early
life
was
exceedingly
limited
and
that
this
system
of
church
government
was
given
as
will
be
seen
by
its
gradual
development
as
portrayed
in
this
work
it
is
absurd
to
accredit
it
to
a
native
ingenuity
it
was
not
a
system
marked
out
in
theory
and
then
organized
on
the
contrary
line
was
given
upon
line
precept
upon
precept
an
officer
was
given
today
and
his
duties
explained
another
given
at
another
time
when
the
development
of
the
work
required
his
services
and
his
duties
explained
after
a
lapse
of
years
men
began
to
discover
that
these
fragments
of
government
constituted
a
most
elaborate
yet
simple
system
a
consistent
whole
based
on
the
highest
and
truest
principles
of
government
a
system
that
while
it
was
suited
to
the
conditions
of
the
church
in
the
earlier
years
of
its
existence
yet
is
capable
of
answering
the
needs
of
the
organization
should
it
be
so
expanded
as
to
fill
the
earth
this
is
a
fact
as
astonishing
to
the
world
as
it
is
gratifying
to
the
saints
the
church
is
its
own
witness
that
the
mind
which
fashioned
it
is
divine
it
is
too
great
in
its
organization
and
yet
too
simple
in
its
administration
to
be
the
creation
of
an
uninspired
mind
especially
of
a
mind
so
narrow
in
its
knowledge
and
inexperienced
in
affairs
related
to
government
as
that
of
joseph
smith
no
neither
the
hand
of
man
nor
the
mind
of
man
created

it
came
from
god

the
impress

its
divine

elijah
the

time

the
israelites

a
brief
outline
of
their
history
who
are
the
children
of
israel

the
descendants
of
abraham
through
the
loins
of
isaac
and
jacob
taking

from
the
patriarch
whose
name
was
changed
by
an
angel

from
jacob

without
the
father
knowledge
was
sold
to
merchants
who
carried
him
into
egypt
his
cruel
brethren
rent
his
clothing
and
stained
it
in
blood
then
taking
it
to
their
father
represented
that
his
son
had
been
destroyed
by
a
wild
beast
the
lord
was
with
joseph
in
egypt
and
gave
him
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
rulers
of
that
land
until
he
became
second
in
authority
in
the
kingdom
having
been
warned
in
a
dream
of
an
approaching
famine
some
years
before
it
took
place
he
laid
up
in
store
an
abundance
of
corn
so
that
while
famine
distressed
surrounding
countries
there
was
plenty
in
egypt
and
thither
the
sons
of
israel
went
to
purchase
food
joseph
revealed
his
identity
to
his
brethren
became
reconciled
to
them
and
sent
for
his
father
and
all
attached
to
his
household
about
seventy
souls
in
all
to
come
to
him
and
take
up
their
abode
in
egypt
this
the
aged
patriarch
did
and
ended
his
days
there
israel
some
time
after
joseph
death
there
arose
a
king
who
knew
him
not
and
observing
that
the
israelites
were
likely
to
become
more
numerous
than
the
egyptians
since
they
did
not
murder
their
offspring
either
before
or
at
birth
as
many
among
the
egyptians
did
this
monarch
enslaved
them
and
placed
task
masters
over
them
and
by
oppression
and
the
destruction
of
their
male
offspring
sought
to
prevent
their
increase
finally
the
lord
raised
up
moses
and
delivered
them
from
bondage
amid
a
splendid
display
of
his
almighty
power
and
eventually
settled
them
in
the
land

canaan

the
captivity
of

the
lost
this
kingdom
of
israel
continued
its
existence
for
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
in
that
time
the
people
may
be
said
to
have
departed
wholly
from
the
paths
of
righteousness
becoming
drunken
licentious
and
idolatrous
so
the
lord
gave
them
up

shalmaneser
a
noted
assyrian
king
made
war
upon
them
utterly
overcame
them

led
them
captives
into
assyria
from
thence
the
lord
led
many
of
them
away
into
the
northern
country
where
no
man
knoweth
and
hence
they
are
denominated
the
lost
tribes
our
reason
for
saying
they
were
led
away
into
the
north
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
many
predictions
of
the
prophets
plainly
declare
that
they
shall
come
from
the
land
of
the
north
a
great
company
etc
and
it
must
be
manifest
that
they
can
not
come
from
the
land
of
the
north
unless
they
are
there
messiah
when
he
visited
the
nephites
after
his
resurrection
plainly
told
them
that
the
other
tribes
of
the
house
of
israel
meaning
the
ten
tribes
the
lord
had
led
away
out
of
the
land
and
he
also
announced
his
intention
of
visiting
them
and
commanded
the
nephites
to
make
a
record
of
it
that
a
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
these
other

might
be
made
known
unto
the

should

messiah
spoke

not
to
be
of

land

the
land
of

neither
in
any
parts

i
have

the
apocryphal
writer
esdras

relating
one
of
his
visions
describes
one
of
the
great
characters
that
figured
in
those
visions
as
calling
unto
himself
a
peaceful
people
those
said
the
angel
sent
to
interpret
the
vision
are
the
tribes

were
carried
away

the
king
whom
salmanaser
the
king
of
the
assyrians
took
captive
and
crossed
them
beyond
the
river
so
were
they
brought
into
another
land
but
they
took
counsel
to
themselves
that
they
would
leave
the
multitude
of
the
heathen
and
go
forth
unto
a
further
country
where
never
man
dwelt
that
they
there
might
keep
their
statutes
which
they
never
kept
in
their
own
land
and
they
entered
in
at
the
narrow
passage
of
the
river
euphrates
for
the
most
high
then
showed
them
signs
and
stayed
the
springs
of
the
flood
till
they
were
passed
over
for
through
the
country
there
was
great
journey
even
of
a
year
and
a
half
and
the
same
region
is
called
arsareth
or
ararah
then
dwelt
they
there
until
the
latter
time
and
when
they
come
forth
again
the
most
high
shall
hold
still
the
springs
of
the
river
again
that
they
may
go
through
therefore
sawest
thou
the
multitude
peaceable
whatever
doubt
may
be
entertained
respecting
the
writings
of
esdras
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
respect
to
the
ten
tribes
and
what
became
of
them
he
is
in
harmony
with
the
statement
made
by
jesus
to
the
nephites
that
the
lord
had
led
them
away
out
of
the
land
the
most
high
according
to

staying
the
springs
of
the
flood
of
the
euphrates
as
he
will
do
when
the
time
comes
for
them
to
return
he
is
also
in
harmony
with
the

who
predict

during

lifetime
of

about
forty
years
after

there
were

founded

united

the
blood
of
israel
sprinkled
among
all
the
jews
since
the
destruction
of
their
city
and
nation
by
the
romans
have
been
scattered
among
all
nations
but
they
have
succeeded
in
a
remarkable
manner
in
preserving
their
identity
as
a
distinct
people
still
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
there
are
instances
where
jews
have
married
and
intermarried
with
the
gentiles
among
whom
they
lived
until
they
lost
their
identity
and
thus
the
blood
of
israel
unrecognized
is
in
the
veins
of
many
supposed
to
be
gentiles
the
tribes
of
israel
sent
into
babylon
assyria
and
the
surrounding
countries
in
like
manner
their
blood
with
the
people
of
those
nations
moreover
there
are
good
reasons
to
believe
that
in
that
exodus
of
the
ten
tribes
from
assyria
to
the
north
many
became
discouraged
and
stopped
by
the
way
others
unable
to
prosecute
the
journey
also
abandoned
the
expedition
and
these
that
thus
halted
uniting
and
intermarrying
with
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
land
constituted
those
prolific
races
that
the
western
division
of
the
roman
empire
in
this
manner
the
blood
of
israel
has
been
sprinkled
almost
among
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
until
the
word
of
the
lord
which
says
i
will
sift
the
house
of
israel
among
all
nations
has
been
literally
fulfilled
the

israel
and
judah
have
thus
been
scattered

destroyed

trodden

the
remnant
of
this
favored
people
of

to
the
promises
of
the

promised

his
appearing
to
him
and
to
oliver
cowdery
in

temple
and
the
work
has
begun
i
think
it
proper
here
to
give
some
of
the
passages
of
scripture
which
promise
the
gathering
of
israel
from
the
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
ye
nations
and
declare
it
in
the
isles
afar
off
and
say
he
that
scattered
israel
will
gather
him
and
keep
him
as
a
shepherd
doth
his
flock
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
jacob
and
ransomed
him
from
the
hand
of
him
that
was
stronger
than
he
therefore
they
shall
come
and
sing
in
the
height
of

shall
flow
together
to
the
goodness
of
the
lord
for
wheat

for
wine

for

for
the
young
of
the
flock

of
the

and
their
soul
shall
be

they
shall
not

extends
to
all

it

how
do
you

salvation
for
the
the
appearing
of
elijah
the
prophet
in
the
kirtland
temple
on
the
of
april
was
the
introduction
of
another
great
work
connected
with
the
redemption
of
the
human
race
that
work
is
salvation
for
the
dead
the
keys
of
which
were
given
to
the
prophet
joseph
smith
by
elijah
on
the
occasion
of
the
appearing
mentioned
above
that
event
was
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
this
great
dispensation
it
began
a
revolution
in
the
theology
of
the
christian
world
up
to
that
time
it
was
universally
believed
by
orthodox
christians
that
the
souls
of
men
who
died
without
conversion
to
the
christian
religion
were
everlastingly
lost
it
was
believed
that
the
application
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
was
limited
to
this
life
and
those
who
failed
through
whatever
cause
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
means
of
salvation
it
affords
are
forever
barred
from
such
benefits
if
the
tree
fall
toward
the
south
or
toward
the
north
in
the
place
where
the
tree
falleth
there
it
shall
lie
and
they
argued
from
this
that
in
whatever
state
a
man
died
so
he
remained
if
he
died
in
a
state
of
justification
his
salvation
was
assured
but
if
not
then
justification
and
consequently
salvation
was
forever
beyond
his
hope
this
sectarian
doctrine
which
does
so
much
violence
to
the
justice
of
god
since
it
closes
the
door
of
salvation
against
so
many
thousands
of
god
children
through
no
other
circumstances
than
that
they
never
so
much
as
heard
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
and
therefore
could
not
either
believe
or
obey
first
through
a
misconception
of
the
doctrine
of
eternal
punishment
with
which
the
wicked
are
threatened
in
the
scriptures
and
second
through
a
very
narrow
conception
of
the
sure
mercies
of
god
christian
dogma
of
eternal
christians
believe
that
to
receive
eternal
punishment
was
to
be
punished
eternally
this
popular
christian
error
was
corrected
in
a
revelation
to
martin
harris
through
joseph
smith
even
before
the
church
was
organized
in
that
revelation
it
is
explained
that
god
is
endless
that
is
one
of
his
names
as
also
is
eternal
one
of
his
names
therefore
eternal
punishment
is
god
punishment
endless
punishment
is
punishment
in
other
words
the
punishment
that
will
overtake
the
wicked
is
eternal
punishment
endless
punishment
but
christians
mistaking
the
name
of
the
punishment
for
the
sign
of
its
duration
taught
that
men
were
punished
eternally
for
the
sins
committed
in
this
life
then
again
god
punishment
is
eternal
that
is
it
always
exists
it
is
eternal
as
god
is
but
the
transgressor
receives
only
so
much
of
it
endures
it
only
so
long
as
may
be
necessary
to
satisfy
the
reasonable
claims
of
justice
tempered
with
mercy
then
when
the
insulted
law
is
vindicated
the
offender
is
released
from
the
punishment
but
as
the
bars
survive
the
captive
they
enthrall
as
the
prison
remains
after
the
transgressor
has
served
his
time
in
it
so
in
god
government
the
punishment
eternally
remains
after
transgressors
have
satisfied
the
claims
of
justice
and
are
relieved
from
its
pains
and
penalties
it
remains
to
vindicate
the
law
of
god
whenever
it
shall
be
broken
but
men
read
he
that
believeth
not
the
gospel
shall
be
damned
and
they
are
taught
to
believe
that
they
were
damned
to
all
eternity
that
they
were
consigned
forever
to
the
flames
of
hell
see
note
end
of
section
one
would
think
that
right
conceptions
of
the
attributes
of
justice
and
mercy
as
they
exist
in
god
character
would
lead
men
to
the
rejection
of
the
horrible
dogma
of
eternal
punishment
as
taught
by
orthodox
christianity
but
if
that
be
not
sufficient
then
the
scriptures
themselves
refute
it
as
will
appear
in
the
following
paragraphs
preaching
to
the
spirits
in
from
a
remark
made
in
the
writings
of
the
apostle
peter
we
learn
that
after
messiah
was
put
to
death
in
the
flesh
he
went
and
preached
to
the
spirits
in
prison
which
sometime
aforetime
were
disobedient
when
once
the
of
god
waiting
in
the
days
of
noah
during
the
three
days
then
that
messiah
body
lay
in
the
tomb
at
jerusalem
his
spirit
was
in
the
world
of
spirits
preaching
to
those
who
had
rejected
the
preaching
of
righteous
noah
the
christian
traditions
no
less
than
the
scriptures
teach
that
jesus
went
down
into
hell
and
preached
to
those
there
held
in
ward
see
note
end
of
section
not
only
is
the
mere
fact
of
messiah
going
to
the
spirit
prison
stated
in
the
scripture
but
the
purpose
of
his
going
there
is
learned
from
the
same
source
for
this
cause
was
the
gospel
preached
also
to
them
that
are
dead
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
but
live
according
to
god
in
the
spirit
this
manifestly
means
that
these
spirits
who
had
once
rejected
the
counsels
of
god
against
themselves
had
the
gospel
again
preached
to
them
and
had
the
privilege
of
living
according
to
its
precepts
in
the
spirit
life
and
of
being
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
or
as
men
in
the
flesh
are
judged
that
is
according
to
the
degree
of
their
faithfulness
to
the
precepts
of
the
gospel
naturally
the
question
arises
why
was
the
gospel
preached
to
the
spirits
in
prison
who
had
once
been
disobedient
if
there
were
no
means
by
which
it
could
be
applied
to
them
for
their
salvation
we
can
scarcely
suppose
that
messiah
would
preach
the
gospel
to
them
if
it
could
do
them
no
good
he
did
not
go
there
to
mock
their
sufferings
or
to
add
something
to
the
torture
of
their
damnation
by
explaining
the
beauties
of
that
salvation
now
forever
beyond
their
reach
such
a
supposition
would
at
once
be
revolting
to
reason
insulting
to
the
justice
of
god
and
utterly
repugnant
to
the
dictates
of
mercy
following
that
question
comes
another
if
the
gospel
is
preached
again
to
those
who
have
once
rejected
it
how
much
sooner
will
it
be
presented
to
those
who
have
never
heard
it
who
have
lived
in
those
generations
when
the
gospel
and
the
authority
to
administer
its
ordinances
were
not
in
the
earth
seeing
that
those
who
once
rejected
the
offer
of
salvation
had
it
presented
to
them
again
after
paying
the
penalty
of
their
first
disobedience
it
would
seem
that
those
who
lived
when
it
was
not
upon
the
earth
or
who
when
it
was
upon
the
earth
perished
in
ignorance
of
it
will
much
sooner
come
to
salvation
of
the
things
we
have
written
this
is
the
sum
the
gospel
was
preached
by
messiah
to
the
spirits
in
prison
who
had
rejected
the
teachings
of
noah
therefore
there
must
be
some
means
through
which
its
precepts
and
ordinances
may
be
applied
to
them
if
the
gospel
can
be
made
available
to
those
who
once
rejected
the
proffered
mercies
of
god
its
privileges
will
much
sooner
and
doubtless
more
abundantly
be
granted
to
those
who
died
in
ignorance
of
it
baptism
for
the
the
manner
in
which
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
may
be
administered
to
those
who
have
died
without
receiving
them
is
hinted
at
by
paul
writing
to
the
corinthians
on
the
subject
of
the
resurrection
correcting
those
who
said
there
was
no
resurrection
he
asks
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
dead
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
all
why
are
they
then
baptized
for
the
dead
in
this
the
apostle
manifestly
referred
to
a
practice
which
existed
among
the
christian
saints
of
the
living
being
baptized
for
the
dead
and
argues
from
the
existence
of
that
practice
that
the
dead
must
rise
or
why
the
necessity
of
being
baptized
for
the
dead
though
this
is
the
only
passage
in
the
new
testament
or
in
the
whole
bible
that
refers
directly
to
the
subject
yet
of
itself
it
is
sufficient
to
establish
the
fact
that
such
a
principle
was
known
among
the
ancient
saints
see

god
to

church
in
this
dispensation
the
following
may
be
learned
elijah
in
the
fulfillment
of
ancient
prophecy
appeared
unto
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
and
delivered
to
them
those
keys
or
powers
of
the
priesthood
which
give
to
the
living
the
right
to
do
a
work
for
the
salvation
of
the
dead
as
a
consequence
the
hearts
of
the
children
are
turned
to
the
fathers
and
of
course
since
the
fathers
in
the
spirit
world
through
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
learn
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
their
children
to
do
a
work
for
them
their
hearts
are
turned
to
the
children
and
thus
the
predicted
result
to
follow
elijah
mission
is
fulfilled
the
work
that
the
living
may
do
for
the
dead
is
that
of
attending
to
outward
ordinances
baptisms
confirmations
ordinations
washings
anointings
and
sealings
all
being
appointed
by
revelation
and
the
direction
of
the
lord
and
all
sealed
and
ratified
by
the
power
of
the
priesthood
of
god
which
binds
on
earth
and
in
heaven
it
is
required
that
all
baptisms
and
other
ordinances
of
the
gospel
performed
for
the
dead
be
attended
to
in
houses
and
more
properly
in
temples
specially
dedicated
for
holy
purposes
those
ordinances
are
to
be
faithfully
recorded
by
those
who
see
and
hear
them
performed
that
there
may
be
valid
testimony
that
the
work
has
been
done
these
ordinances
attended
to
on
earth
by
the
living
and
accepted
in
the
spirit
world
by
those
for
whom
they
are
performed
will
make
them
a
patent
means
of
salvation
to
the
dead
and
of
exaltation
to
the
living
since
they
become
in
very
deed
saviors
upon
mount
zion
this
work
that
can
be
done
for
the
dead
enlarges
one
view
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
one
begins
to
see
indeed
that
it

associated
with
the
subjects
treated
in
the
forgoing
paragraphs
of
this
section
is
the
subject
of
the
different
degrees
of
glory
nothing
is
more
clearly
stated
in
holy
writ
than
that
men
will
be
judged
and
rewarded
according
to
their
works
and
as
their
works
vary
in
degree
or
righteousness
so
will
their
rewards
vary
and
so
will
they
have
bestowed
upon
them
different
degrees
of
glory
according
as
their
works
shall
merit
and
their
intelligence
be
capable
of
comprehending
messiah
said
to
his
disciples
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
if
it
were
not
so
i
would
have
told
you
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
that
where
i
am
there
ye
may
be
also
still
it
is
commonly
held
among
christian
sects
that
he
who
attains
heaven
partakes
immediately
of
the
highest
glories
while
he
who
misses
heaven
goes
direct
to
hell
and
partakes
of
all
its
miseries
forever
yet
nothing
is
clearer
than
the
fact
that
there
are
different
heavens
spoken
of
in
scripture
and
different
degrees
of
glory
when
solomon
dedicated
the
temple
he
had
builded
he
exclaimed
in
his
prayer
behold
the
heaven
and
heaven
of
heavens
can
not
contain
thee
how
much
less
this
house
which
i
have
builded
paul
in
writing
to
the
corinthians
says
i
knew
a
man
in
christ
above
fourteen
years
ago
such
an
one
caught
up
to
the
third
heaven
and
i
knew
such
a
man
how
that
he
was
caught
up
into
paradise
and
heard
unspeakable
words
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
utter
reasoning
on
the
resurrection
the
last
writer
quoted
says
there
are
also
celestial
bodies
and
bodies
terrestrial
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
another
there
is
one
glory
of
the
sun
and
another
glory
of
the
moon
and
another
glory
of
the
stars
for
as
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
in
glory
so
also
is
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
in
all
this
however
the
great
subject
is
but
vaguely
hinted
at
for
a
full
understanding
of
it
we
are
indebted
to
a
revelation
given
to
joseph
smith
february
from
that
revelation
we
summarized
the
following
the
celestial
they
who
receive
the
testimony
of
jesus
that
believe
on
his
name
and
are
baptized
after
the
manner
of
his
burial
that
by
keeping
the
commandments
they
might
be
washed
and
cleansed
from
all
sin
and
receive
the
holy
ghost
by
the
laying
on
of
hands
by
those
having
authority
who
overcome
by
faith
and
are
sealed
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
these
become
the
church
of
the
first
born
they
are
they
into
whose
hands
the
father
hath
given
all
things
they
are
priests
and
kings
who
have
received
of
fullness
and
of
his
glory
they
are
priests
of
the
most
high
after
the
order
of
melchisedek
which
is
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
therefore
they
are
gods
even
the
sons
of
god
all
things
are
theirs
whether
life
or
death
or
things
present
or
things
to
come
all
are
theirs
and
they
are
christ
and
christ
is
god
they
shall
overcome
all
things
they
shall
dwell
in
the
presence
of
god
and
christ
forever
and
forever
they
are
they
whom
christ
will
bring
with
him
when
he
shall
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
to
reign
on
the
earth
over
his
people
they
have
part
in
the
resurrection
of
the
just
their
names
are
written
in
heaven
where
god
and
christ
dwell
they
are
just
men
made
perfect
through
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
these
are
they
whose
bodies
are
celestial
whose
glory
the
sun
in
heaven
is
spoken
of
as
typical
they
inherit
the
celestial
glory
they
see
as
they
are
seen
and
know
as
they
are
known
the
terrestrial
the
terrestrial
glory
differs
from
the
celestial
glory
as
the
light
of
the
moon
differs
from
the
light
of
the
sun
these
are
they
who
died
without
law
and
also
they
who
are
the
spirits
of
men
in
prison
whom
the
son
visited
and
preached
the
gospel
unto
them
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
who
received
not
the
testimony
of
jesus
in
the
flesh
but
afterwards
received
it
these
are
they
who
are
honorable
men
of
the
earth
who
were
blinded
by
the
craftiness
of
men
these
are
they
who
receive
of
god
glory
but
not
of
his
fullness
they
may
enjoy
the
presence
of
the
son
but
not
of
the
presence
of
the
father
these
are
they
who
are
not
valiant
in
the
testimony
of
jesus
therefore
they
obtain
not
the
crown
over
the
kingdom
of
god
the
telestial
the
telestial
glory
differs
from
the
terrestrial
as
the
light
of
the
stars
differs
from
the
light
of
the
moon
the
inhabitants
of
the
telestial
glory
are
those
who
neither
received
the
gospel
of
christ
in
the
flesh
nor
the
testimony
of
jesus
in
the
spirit
world
these
are
they
who
are
thrust
down
to
hell
and
will
not
be
redeemed
from
the
devil
until
the
last
resurrection
when
christ
shall
have
finished
his
work
these
are
they
who
are
of
paul
and
of
apollos
and
of
cephas
some
of
christ
and
some
of
john
some
of
moses
and
some
of
elias
but
received
not
the
gospel
nor
the
testimony
of
jesus
these
are
they
who
will
not
be
gathered
with
the
saints
to
be
caught
up
unto
the
church
of
the
first
born
and
received
into
the
cloud
these
are
liars
and
sorcerers
and
adulterers
and
whoremongers
and
whosoever
loves
and
makes
a
lie
they
suffer
the
wrath
of
god
on
earth
and
the
vengeance
of
eternal
fire
but
they
will
be
judged
every
man
according
to
his
works
and
receive
according
to
his
works
his
own
dominion
in
the
mansions
which
are
prepared
and
they
shall
be
servants
of
the
most
high
but
where
god
and
christ
dwell
they
can
not
come
worlds
without
end
they
of
the
telestial
glory
enjoy
neither
the
presence
of
the
father
nor
the
son
but
receive
the
ministration
of
angels
and
of
the
holy
ghost
for
even
they
of
the
telestial
glory
are
accounted
heirs
of
salvation
the
prophet
joseph
and
sidney
rigdon
in
their
vision
saw
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
telestial
glory
were
as
innumerable
as
the
stars
in
the
firmament
of
heaven
or
as
the
sand
upon
the
sea
shore
and
they
heard
the
voice
of
god
saying
these
all
shall
bow
the
knee
and
every
tongue
shall
confess
to
him
who
sits
upon
the
throne
forever
and
ever
for
they
shall
be
judged
according
to
their
works
and
every
man
shall
receive
according
to
his
own
works
his
own
dominions
in
the
mansions
which
are
prepared
and
they
shall
be
servants
of
the
most
high
but
where
god
and
christ
dwell
they
can
not
come
worlds
without
end
degrees
within
the
three
great
kingdoms
of
these
are
the
three
great
divisions
of
glory
in
the
world
to
come
but
within
these
great
divisions
are
subdivisions
or
degrees
the
prophet
joseph
taught
that
in
the
celestial
glory
there
are
three
heavens
or
degrees
of
the
telestial
glory
it
is
written
and
the
glory
of
the
telestial
is
one
even
as
the
glory
of
the
stars
is
one
for
as
one
star
differs
from
another
star
in
glory
even
so
differs
one
from
another
in
glory
in
the
telestial
world
from
this
it
is
evident
that
there
are
different
degrees
of
glory
within
the
celestial
and
telestial
glories
and
though
we
have
no
direct
authority
for
the
statement
it
seems
but
reasonable
to
conclude
that
there
are
different
degrees
of
glory
in
the
terrestrial
world
also
it
appears
but
rational
that
it
should
be
so
since
the
degrees
of
worthiness
in
men
are
almost
infinite
in
their
variety
and
as
every
man
is
to
be
judged
according
to
his
works
it
will
require
a
corresponding
infinity
of
degrees
in
glory
to
mete
out
to
every
man
that
reward
of
which
he
is
worthy
and
that
also
which
his
intelligence
will
enable
him
to
enjoy
progress
within
and
from
different
degrees
of
the
question
of
advancement
within
the
great
divisions
of
glory
celestial
terrestrial
and
telestial
as
also
the
question
of
advancement
from
one
sphere
of
glory
to
another
remains
to
be
considered
in
the
revelation
from
which
we
have
summarized
what
has
been
written
here
in
respect
to
the
different
degrees
of
glory
it
is
said
that
those
of
the
terrestrial
glory
will
be
ministered
unto
by
those
of
the
celestial
and
those
of
the
telestial
will
be
ministered
unto
by
those
of
the
terrestrial
that
is
those
of
the
higher
glory
minister
to
those
of
a
lesser
order
of
glory
we
can
conceive
of
no
reason
for
all
this
administration
of
the
higher
to
the
lower
unless
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
our
father
children
along
the
lines
of
eternal
progression
whether
or
not
in
the
great
future
full
of
so
many
possibilities
now
hidden
from
us
they
of
the
lesser
glories
after
education
and
advancement
within
those
spheres
may
at
last
emerge
from
them
and
make
their
way
to
the
higher
degrees
of
glory
until
at
last
they
attain
to
the
highest
is
not
revealed
in
the
revelations
of
god
and
any
statement
made
on
the
subject
must
partake
more
or
less
of
the
nature
of
conjecture
but
if
it
be
granted
that
such
a
thing
is
possible
they
who
at
the
first
entered
into
the
celestial
glory
having
before
them
the
privilege
also
of
eternal
progress
have
been
moving
onward
so
that
the
relative
distance
between
them
and
those
who
have
fought
their
way
up
from
the
lesser
glories
may
be
as
great
when
the
latter
have
come
into
the
degrees
of
celestial
glory
in
which
the
righteous
at
first
stood
as
it
was
at
the
commencement
and
thus
between
them
is
an
impassable
gulf
which
time
can
not
destroy
thus
those
whose
faith
and
works
are
such
only
as
to
entitle
them
to
inherit
a
telestial
glory
may
arrive
at
last
where
those
whose
works
in
this
life
were
such
as
to
entitle
them
to
entrance
into
the
celestial
kingdom
they
may
arrive
where
these
were
but
never
where
they
are
sons
of
there
is
a
class
of
souls
with
whom
the
justice
of
god
must
deal
which
will
not
and
can
not
be
classified
in
the
celestial
terrestrial
or
telestial
glories
they
are
the
sons
of
perdition
but
though
they
will
not
be
assigned
a
place
in
either
of
these
grand
divisions
of
glory
the
revelation
from
which
we
have
drawn
our
information
respecting
man
future
state
describes
the
condition
of
these
sons
of
perdition
so
far
as
it
is
made
known
unto
the
children
of
men
it
also
informs
us
as
to
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
calls
for
such
grievous
punishment
the
sons
of
perdition
are
they
of
whom
god
hath
said
that
it
had
been
better
for
them
never
to
have
been
born
for
they
are
vessels
of
wrath
doomed
to
suffer
the
wrath
of
god
with
the
devil
and
his
angels
in
eternity
concerning
whom
he
hath
said
there
is
no
forgiveness
in
this
world
nor
the
world
to
come
these
are
they
who
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
punishment
with
the
devil
and
his
angels
and
the
only
ones
on
whom
the
second
death
shall
have
any
power
the
only
ones
who
will
not
be
redeemed
in
the
due
time
of
the
lord
after
the
sufferings
of
his
wrath
he
saves
all
the
works
of
his
hands
except
these
sons
of
perdition
but
they
go
away
to
reign
with
the
devil
and
his
angels
in
eternity
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
which
is
their
torment
the
end
thereof
the
place
thereof
no
man
knoweth
it
has
not
been
revealed
nor
will
it
be
revealed
unto
man
except
to
them
who
are
made
partakers
thereof
it
has
been
partially
shown
to
some
in
vision
and
may
be
shown
again
in
the
same
partial
manner
to
others
but
the
end
the
width
the
height
the
depth
and
the
misery
thereof
they
understand
not
nor
will
any
one
but
those
who
receive
the
terrible
condemnation
such
the
punishment
now
as
to
the
crime
that
merits
it
it
is
the
crime
of
high
treason
to
god
which
pulls
down
on
men
this
fearful
doom
it
falls
upon
men
who
know
the
power
of
god
and
who
have
been
made
partakers
of
it
and
then
permit
themselves
to
be
so
far
overcome
of
the
devil
that
they
deny
the
truth
that
has
been
revealed
to
them
and
defy
the
power
of
god
they
deny
the
holy
ghost
after
having
received
it
they
deny
the
only
begotten
son
of
the
father
after
the
father
hath
revealed
him
and
in
this
crucify
him
unto
themselves
anew
and
put
him
to
an
open
shame
they
commit
the
same
act
of
high
treason
that
lucifer
in
the
rebellion
of
heaven
did
and
hence
are
worthy
of
the
same
punishment
with
him
thank
god
the
number
who
commit
that
fearful
crime
is
but
few
it
is
only
those
who
attain
to
a
very
great
knowledge
of
the
things
of
god
that
are
capable
of
committing
it
and
the
number
among
such
are
few
indeed
who
become
so
recklessly
wicked
as
to
rebel
against
and
defy
the
power
of
god
but
when
such
characters
do
fall
they
fall
like
lucifer
never
to
rise
again
they
get
beyond
the
power
of
repentance
or
the
hope
of
forgiveness

sectarian
dogma

is
nothing
more
obnoxious

such
a
thing
as
a
living
man
being
baptized
for
one
who
is
dead
the
writer
in
biblical
literature
kitto
expresses
these
views
from
the
wording
of
the
sentence
why
then
are
they
baptized
for
the
dead
the
most
simple
impression
certainly
is
that
paul
speaks
of
a
baptism
which
a
living
man
receives
in
the
place
of
a
dead
one
this
interpretation
is
particularly
adopted
by
those
expounders
with
whom
grammatical
construction
is
of
paramount
importance
and
the
first
thing
to
be
considered
this
view
is
also
upheld
by
ambrose
among
the
early
christian
writers
and
by
erasmus
scaliger
grotius
calixtus
among
the
moderns
and
still

this
the
only
possible
meaning

words

writer
of

marcionites

sect
of
christians
to
whom
he
was
opposed
says
in
this
country
i
mean
asia
and
even
galatea
their
school
flourished
eminently
and
a
traditional
fact
concerning
them
has
reached
us
that
when
any
of
them
had
died
without
baptism
they
used
to
baptize
others
in
their
name
lest
in
the
resurrection
they
should
suffer
punishment
as
unbaptized
heresies
this
proves
beyond
controversy
the
fact
that
vicarious
baptism
for
the
dead
was
practiced
among
some
sects
of
the
early
christians
another
fact
proves
it
still
more
emphatically
than
this
statement

epiphanius
the
council
of
carthages
held
in
its
sixth
canon
forbids
the
administration
of
baptism
and
holy
communion
for

it
was
in

also
that
the

introduced
celestial
marriage
the
marriage
system
which
obtains
in

it
consists
of
the
eternity
of
the
marriage
covenant
that
is
the
marriage
covenant
between
a
man
and

made
for
time
and
all

and
being
sealed
by
that
power
of
the
priesthood
which
binds
on
earth
and
in
heaven
the
covenant
holds
good
in
heaven
as
well
as
on

and
by
reason
of
it
men
will
have
claim
upon

upon
their
husbands

and
after
the
resurrection
celestial
marriage
may
also
include
a
plurality
of
wives
eternity
of
the
marriage
this
new
marriage
system
new
at
least
to
this
generation
completely
revolutionized
the
ideas
of
the
saints
in
respect
to
the
marriage
institution
in
common
with
the
christian
sects
they
had
regarded
marriage
vaguely
as
an
institution
to
exist
in
this
world
only
and
married
their
wives
as
other
christians
did
and
now
do
until
death
shall
them
part
but
by
the
revelation
which
the
prophet
made
known
at
nauvoo
they
learned
that
in
celestial
spheres
the
marriage
covenant
exists
eternally
and
that
the
pleasing
joys
of
family
ties
and
associations
coupled
with
the
power
of
endless
increase
contributes
to
the
happiness
power
and
dominion
of
those
who
attain
to
the
celestial
glory
what
a
revelation
was
here
instead
of
the
power
of
being
one
of
the
things
that
is
to
pass
away
it
is
one
of
the
chief
means
of
exaltation
and
glory
in
that
great
eternity
which
like
an
endless
vista
stretches
out
before
him
through
it
man
attains
to
the
glory
of
the
endless
increase
of
eternal
lives
and
the
right
of
presiding
as
priest
and
patriarch
king
and
lord
over
his
posterity
instead
of
the
commandment
be
fruitful
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
being
an
unrighteous
law
it
is
one
by
means
of
which
the
race
of
gods
is
perpetuated
and
it
is
as
holy
and
pure
as
the
commandment
repent
and
be
baptized
through
that
law
in
connection
with
an
observance
of
all
the
other
laws
of
the
gospel
man
will
yet
attain
unto
the
power
of
the
godhead
and
like
his
father
god
his
chief
glory
shall
be
to
bring
to
pass
the
eternal
life
and
happiness
of
man
plurality
of
celestial
marriage
as
already
observed
may
include
a
plurality
of
wives
this
was
as
great
an
innovation
as
marriage
for
eternity
it
came
in
conflict
with
the
education
and
tradition
of
the
saints
and
the
sentiments
of
the
age
still
god
had
commanded
it
through
his
prophet

though
their
prejudices
the
fruit
of
their
traditions
revolted
against
it
the
faithful
to
whom
it
was
revealed
resolved
to
obey
it
it
was
in
that
plural
marriage
was
first
made
known
to
joseph
smith
in
that
year
he
was
engaged
in
revising
by
inspiration
the
jewish
scriptures
and
observing
with
what
favor
the
lord
regarded
the
early
patriarchs
and
many
of
the
kings
and
prophets
of
the
jews
who
had
a
plurality
of
wives
he
inquired
of
god
how
it
was
he
justified
them
in
that
thing
the
lord
in
answer
revealed
the
law
of
celestial
marriage
but
the
time
had
not
come
for
the
saints
to
enter
into
its
practice
and
hence
the
prophet
kept
it
locked
up
a
secret
in
his
own
breast
with
the
exception
of
saying
to
one
or
two
of
his
most
confidential
friends
that
plural
marriage
was
a
correct
principle

has
published
a
work
on
this
subject
the
divine
authenticity
of
the
book
of
abraham
which
should
be
carefully
studied
by
every
elder
in
israel
the
establishment
of
plural
the
principle
of
plural
marriage
was
first
revealed
to
joseph
smith
in
but
being
forbidden
to
make
it
public
or
to
teach
it
as
a
doctrine
of
the
gospel
at
that
time
he
confided
the
facts
to
only
a
very
few
of
his
intimate
associates
among
them
were
oliver
cowdery
and
lyman
johnson
the
latter
confiding
the
fact
to
his
traveling
companion
elder
orson
pratt
in
the
year
and
this
great
principle
remained
concealed
in
the
bosoms
of
the
prophet
joseph
smith
and
the
few
to
whom
he
revealed
it
until
he
was
commanded
about
to
instruct
the
leading
members
of
the
priesthood
and
those
who
were
most
faithful
and
intelligent
and
best
prepared
to
receive
it
in
relation
thereto
at
which
time
and
subsequently
until
his
martyrdom
the
subject
in
connection
with
the
great
principles
of
baptism
redemption
and
sealing
for
the
dead
became
the
great
theme
of
his
life
and
as
the
late
president
george
smith
repeatedly
said
to
me
and
others
the
prophet
seemed
irresistibly
moved
by
the
power
of
god
to
establish
that
principle
not
only
in
theory
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
his
brethren

in
practice

it

circumstances

it

how
plural
marriage
was
introduced
and
practiced
in
nauvoo
after
the
church
settled
in
salt
lake
valley
it
was
publicly
proclaimed
as
a
doctrine
of
the
church
in
the
practice
of
it
then
was
public
the
whole
church
and
at
that
time
the
members
of
the
church
comprised
nearly
the
whole
community
approving
the
principle
which
was
at
once
recognized
as
a
proper
religious
institution
enactments
of
congress
against
plural
for
ten
years
the
practice
in
utah
of
this
system
of
marriage
met
with
no
opposition
from
the
united
states
but
in
a
law
was
enacted
by
congress
to
punish
and
prevent
the
practice
of
polygamy
in
the
territories
of
the
united
states
the
penalties
affixed
were
a
fine
not
to
exceed
five
hundred
dollars
and
imprisonment
not
to
exceed
five
years
for
twenty
years
however
the
law
remained
practically
a
dead
letter
it
was
claimed
by
the
saints
that
it
was
an
infringement
of
the
religious
liberty
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
since
it
prohibited
the
free
exercise
of
religion
for
twenty
years
no
pronounced
effort
was
made
by
the
officers
of
the
general
government
to
enforce
the
law
in
however
the
law
enacted
twenty
years
before
was
supplemented
by
what
is
known
as
the
edmunds
law
in
addition
to
defining
the
crime
polygamy
for
which
it
retained
the
same
penalties
as
the
law
of
the
edmunds
law
also
made
the
cohabiting
with
more
than
one
woman
a
crime
punishable
by
a
fine
not
to
exceed
three
hundred
dollars
and
by
imprisonment
not
to
exceed
six
months
this
law
also
rendered
persons
who
were
living
in
polygamy
or
who
believed
in
its
rightfulness
incompetent
to
act
as
grand
or
petit
jurors
and
also
disqualified
all
polygamists
for
voting
or
holding
office
this
law
of
was
supplemented
by
the
law
enacted
in
which
made
the
legal
wife
or
husband
in
case
of
polygamy
or
unlawful
cohabitation
a
competent
witness
provided
the
accused
consented
thereto
it
also
enlarged
the
powers
of
united
states
commissioners
and
marshals
and
required
certificates
of
all
marriages
to
be
filed
in
the
office
of
the
probate
court
the
violation
of
this
last
provision
was
a
fine
of
one
thousand
dollars
and
imprisonment
for
two
years
the

disincorporated
the
church

up

every

of

to
deprive
the

was

church
to
proclaim
its
discontinuance
and
the
people
with
hearts
bursting
with
grief
submitted
to
the
will
of
heaven
and
there
the
matter
rests
if
the
labors
and
sufferings
of
the
church
of
christ
for
this
principle
have
done
nothing
more
this
much
at
least
has
been
accomplished
the
saints
have
borne
testimony
to
the
truth
and
it
is
for
god
to
vindicate
his
own
law
and
open
the
way
for
its
establishment
on
the
earth
which
doubtless
he
will
do
when
his
kingdom
shall
come
in
power
and
when
his
will
shall
be
done
in
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
laying

one
of
the
most
pleasing
and
at
the

time
one
of
the
most
important
events
in
the
history
of
the
church
during
the
administration
of

a
resolution
was
adopted
to
complete
the
sacred

dedicate
it

the
of
april
forty
years
from
the
time
the
thereof
was
laid

growth
and
present
condition
of
the
church
since
the
saints
settled
in
the
valleys
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
church
has
been
making
steady
growth
in
numbers
and
its
territorial
boundaries

the

noted
for
peace
and
good
order
for
the
cleanliness
thrift
sobriety
and
the
comfortable
circumstances
of
the
people
but
few
individuals
in
the
church
can
be
considered
wealthy
yet
as
a
whole
the
community
is
rich
most
of
the
people
owning
their
homes
the
lands
they
cultivate
and
the
flocks
and
herds
they
tend
the
land
has
been
blessed
for
their
sakes
and
made
to
yield
in
its
strength
they
are
a
contented
happy
and
fast
becoming
a
mighty
people
they
are
diligently
preaching
the
gospel
to
the
world

sent
missionaries
to
nearly
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
in
the
british
isles
and
among
the
scandinavian
and
german
people
the
missionaries
have
been
especially
successful
of
late
years
great
progress
has
been
made
also
among
the
natives
of
new

sandwich
islands
and
other

notably
in
samoa
the
church
is
also
devoting
much
of
its
energies
to
the
work
for
the

four
magnificent
temples
have
been
reared
by

one
in

another
in
manti
dedicated
of

and
one
in
salt

dedicated
on
the

in
these
temples
the
faithful
saints
are
doing
a
noble
and
a
mighty
work
for
their
ancestors
as
well
as
a
very
important
work
for
the
living
a
preparatory
the
work
of
god
as
revealed
through
the
prophet
joseph
smith
has
a
peculiar
significance
to
this
generation
it
is
essentially
a
preparatory
work
its
direct
mission
is
to
prepare
for
the
glorious
coming
of
the
son
of
god
to
reign
over
the
earth
nothing
can
be
more
explicitly
stated
in
the
scripture
than
the
fact
that
the
son
of
god
will
come
to
the
earth
in
the
glory
of
his
father
to
reward
the
righteous
with
a
speedy
resurrection
from
the
dead
and
destroy
the
wicked
by
the
judgments
of
famine
pestilence
and
war
to
establish
his
kingdom
in
power
bringing
in
a
reign
of
peace
liberty
and
righteousness
in
proof
of
this
let
the
student
consider
the
following
scripture
promise
of
messiah
glorious
return
and
when
he
had
spoken
these
things
while
they
beheld
he
was
taken
up
and
a
cloud
received
him
out
of
their
sight
and
while
they
looked
steadfastly
toward
heaven
as
he
went
up
behold
two
men
angels
stood
by
them
in
white
apparel
which
also
said
ye
men
of
galilee
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven
this
same
jesus
which
is
taken
up
from
you
into
heaven
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
seen
him
go
into
heaven
for
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
father
with
his
angels
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works
messiah
to
come
to
judgment
for
if
we
believe
that
jesus
died
and
rose
again
even
so
them
also
which
sleep
in
jesus
will
god
bring
with
him
for
this
we
say
unto
you
by
the
word
of
the
lord
that
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
unto
the
coming
of
the
lord
shall
not
prevent
them
which
are
asleep
for
the
lord
himself
shall
descend
from
heaven
with
a
shout
with
the
voice
of
the
archangel
and
with
the
trump
of
god
and
the
dead
in
christ
shall
rise
first
then
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
shall
be
caught
up
together
with
them
in
the
clouds
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
air
and
so
shall
we
ever
be
with
the
lord
and
to
you
who
are
troubled
rest
with
us
when
the
lord
jesus
shall
be
revealed
from
heaven
with
his
mighty
angels
in
flaming
fire
taking
vengeance
on
them
that
know
not
god
and
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
from
the
glory
of
his
power
when
he
shall
come
to
be
glorified
in
his
saints
and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that
believe
because
our
testimony
among
you
was
believed
in
that
day
for
the
son
of
man
cometh
at
an
hour
when
we
think
not
see
note
end
of
section
the
world
to
be
warned
of
coming
judgments
to
a
number
of
elders
in
kirtland
in
who
had
been
called
to
the
ministry
the
lord
gave
these
instructions
and
of
course
they
apply
to
all
elders
called
to
the
same
ministry
teach
ye
diligently
and
my
grace
shall
attend
you
that
you
may
be
instructed
more
perfectly
in
theory
in
principle
in
doctrine
in
the
law
of
the
gospel
in
all
things
that
pertain
unto
the
kingdom
of
god
that
is
expedient
for
you
to
understand
that
ye
may
be
prepared
in
all
things
when
i
shall
send
you
again
to
magnify
the
calling
whereunto
i
have
called
you
and
the
mission
with
which
i
have
commissioned
you
behold
i
sent
you
out
to
testify
and
warn
the
people
and
it
becometh
every
man
who
hath
been
warned
to
warn
his
neighbor
therefore
they
are
left
without
excuse
and
their
sins
are
upon
their
own
heads
therefore
tarry
ye
and
labor
diligently
that
ye
may
be
perfected
in
your
ministry
to
go
forth
among
the
gentiles
for
the
last
time
as
many
as
the
mouth
of
the
lord
shall
name
to
bind
up
the
law
and
seal
up
the
testimony
and
to
prepare
the
saints
for
the
hour
of
judgment
which
is
to
come
that
their
souls
may
escape
the
wrath
of
god
the
desolation
of
abomination
which
awaits
the
wicked
both
in
this
world
and
the
world
to
come
abide
ye
in
the
liberty
wherewith
ye
are
made
free
entangle
not
yourselves
in
sin
but
let
your
hands
be
clean
until
the
lord
come
for
not
many
days
hence
and
the
earth
shall
tremble
and
reel
to
and
fro
as
a
drunken
man
and
the
sun
shall
hide
his
face
and
shall
refuse
to
give
light
and
the
moon
shall
be
bathed
in
blood
and
the
stars
shall
become
exceeding
angry
and
shall
cast
themselves
down
as
a
fig
that
falleth
from
off
a
fig
tree
and
after
your
testimony
cometh
wrath
and
indignation
upon
the
people
for
after
your
testimony
cometh
the
testimony
of
earthquakes
that
shall
cause
groanings
in
the
midst
of
her
and
men
shall
fall
upon
the
ground
and
shall
not
be
able
to
stand
and
also
cometh
the
testimony
of
the
voice
of
thunderings
and
the
voice
of
lightnings
and
the
voice
of
the
tempest
and
the
voice
of
the
waves
of
the
sea
heaving
themselves
beyond
their
bounds
and
all
things
shall
be
in
commotion
and
surely
men
hearts
shall
fail
them
for
fear
shall
come
upon
all
people
and
angels
shall
fly
through
the
midst
of
heaven
crying
with
a
loud
voice
sounding
the
trump
of
god
saying

it

but
was
not
the
cause
of
our

many
a
time
have
i
listened
to
the
voice
of
our
beloved
prophet
while
in
council
dwell
on
this
subject
with
delight
his
eyes
sparkling
with
animation
and
his
soul
fired
with
the
inspiration
of
the
spirit
of
the
living
god
it
was
a
theme
that
caused
the
bosoms
of
all
who
were
privileged
to
listen
to
thrill
with
delight
intimately
connected
with
this
were
themes
upon

to

died
without

sight
my
spirit
glows
with
sacred
fire

i
reflect

established
let

may
add

the

not

enemies
but
came
here
because
it
was
their

come
because
the

would
have
them
here

the

the

which
discontinued

is
as

inasmuch
as
laws
have
been
enacted
by

forbidding
plural
marriages
which

have
been
pronounced
constitutional
by

to
use
my
influence
with
the
members
of

over

i
preside
to
have
them
do
likewise
and
i
now
publicly
declare
that
my
advice
to
the
saints
is
to
refrain
from
contracting
any
marriage
forbidden
by
the
law
of
the
land
following
is
the
resolution
presented
to
the
conference
in
the
october
following
it
was
presented
by

the
president

the
twelve
apostles
i
move
that
recognizing
wilford
woodruff
as
the
president
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
and
the
only
man
on
the
earth
at
the
present
time
who
holds
the
keys
of
the
sealing
ordinances
we
consider
him
fully
authorized
by
virtue
of
his
position
to
issue
the
manifesto
which
has
been
read
in
our
hearing
and
which
is
dated
september
and
that
as
a
church
in
general
conference
assembled
we
accept
his
declaration
concerning
plural
marriage
as
authoritative
and
binding
the
vote
to
sustain
the
foregoing
motion
was
unanimous
basis
on
which
the
manifesto
was
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
when
i
give
a
commandment
to
any
of
the
sons
of
men
to
do
a
work
unto
my
name
and
those
sons
of
men
go
with
all
their
might
and
with
all
they
have
to
perform
that
work
and
cease
not
their
diligence
and
their
enemies
come
upon
them
and
hinder
them
from
performing
that
work
behold
it
behooveth
me
to
require
that
work
no
more
at
the
hands
of
those
sons
of
men
but
to
accept
of
their
offerings
revelation
given
doc
and
sec
cxxiv
it
is
on
this
basis
that
president
woodruff
has
felt
himself
justified
in
issuing
this
manifesto
we
have
waited
for
the
lord
to
move
in
this
matter
and
on
the
of
september
president
woodruff
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
write
something
and
he
had
the
spirit
of
it
he
had
prayed
about
it
and
he
had
besought
the
lord
repeatedly
to
show
him
what
to
do
at
that
time
the
spirit
came
upon
him
and
the
document
that
has
been
read
in
your
hearing
was
the
result
i
know
that
it
was
right
much
as
it
has
gone
against
the
grain
with
me
in
many
respects
but
when
god
speaks
and
when
god
makes
known
his
mind
and
will
i
hope
that
i
and
all
saints
will
bow
in
submission
to
geo
cannon
in
a
sermon
i
want
to
say
to
all
israel
that
the
step
which
i
have
taken
in
issuing
this
manifesto
has
not
been
done
without
earnest
prayer
before
the
lord
i
have
done
my
duty
and
the
nation
of
which
we
form
a
part
must
be
responsible
for
that
which
has
been
done
in
relation
to
that
principle

president
woodruff
in
a
sermon
testimony
from
god
promised
that
the
manifesto
was
i
have
received
a
revelation
and
commandment
from
the
lord
which
i
have
not
revealed
to
any
man
which
i
shall
reveal
to
this
assembly
and
the
command
of
the
lord
i
shall
give
to
this
people
which
is
this
the
lord
has
revealed
to
me
that
there
are
many
in
the
church
who
feel
badly
tried
about
the
manifesto
and
also
about
the
testimony
of
the
presidency
and
apostles
before
the
master
in
chancery
the
lord
has
commanded
me
to
put
the
following
question
to
the
saints
and
those
who
will
give
strict
attention
to
it
shall
have
the
holy
ghost
to
be
with
them
to
inspire
them
to
answer
that
question
for
themselves
and
the
lord
has
promised
that
the
answer
will
be
to
all
alike
the
question
is
this
which
is
the
wisest
course
for
the
saints
to
pursue
to
continue
to
attempt
to
practice
plural
marriage
with
the
laws
of
the
nation
against
it
and
the
opposition
of
of
people
and
at
the
cost
of
the
confiscation
and
loss
of
all
the
temples
and
the
stopping
of
the
ordinances
therein
both
for
the
living
and
the
dead
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
first
presidency
and
the
twelve
and
the
leaders
of
heads
of
families
in
the
church
and
the
confiscation
of
the
personal
property
of
the
people
all
of
which
of
themselves
would
stop
the
practice
or
after
doing
and
suffering
what
we
have
through
our
adherence
to
this
principle
to
cease
the
practice
and
submit
to
the
law
and
through
doing
so
leave
the
prophets
apostles
and
fathers
at
home
so
that
they
can
instruct
the
people
and
attend
to
the
duties
of
the
church
and
also
leave
the
temples
in
the
hands
of
the
saints
so
that
they
can
attend
to
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
both
for
the
living
and
the
dead
now
the
inspiration
of
the
lord
will
reveal
to
any
person
which
course
wisdom
would
dictate
us
to
pursue
and
the
saints
throughout
all
israel
should
understand
that
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
and
the
twelve
apostles
are
led
and
guided
by
the
inspiration
of
the
lord
and

reasonable
to
conclude
that
he

the
organization
of
the
church
early
in
the
month
of
august
when
the
prophet
joseph
left
his
house
in
harmony
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
wine
to
administer
the
sacrament
to
a
few
saints
visiting
him
at
his
home
he
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
when
he
was
met
by
a
heavenly
messenger
and
received
the
revelation
contained
in
the
doc
and
cov
sec
xxvii
a
portion
of
which
is
as
follows
listen
to
the
voice
of
jesus
christ
your
lord
your
god
and
your
redeemer
whose
word
is
quick
and
powerful
for
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
it
mattereth
not
what
ye
shall
eat
or
what
ye
shall
drink
when
ye
partake
of
the
sacrament
if
it
so
be
that
ye
do
it
with
an
eye
single
to
my
glory
remembering
unto
the
father
my
body
which
was
laid
down
for
you
and
my
blood
which
was
shed
for
the
remission
of
your
sins
wherefore
a
commandment
i
give
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
purchase
wine
neither
strong
drink
of
your
enemies
wherefore
you
shall
partake
of
none
except
it
is
made
new
among
you
yea
in
this
my
father
kingdom
which
shall
be
built
up
on
the
earth
this
revelation
is
the
authority
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
has
for
using
water
instead
of
wine
in
the
sacrament
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
revelation
was
given
before
the
church
was
organized
at
that
time
there
were
a
number
who
had
been
baptized
and
who
had
children
not
old
enough
to
be
baptized
and
had
not
yet
been
blessed
of
the
elders
this
commandment
therefore
was
directed
more
especially
to
them
but
applies
of
course
to
people
placed
in
like
circumstances
subsequently
in
november
the
lord
said
inasmuch
as
parents
have
children
in
zion
or
in
any
of
her
stakes
which
are
organized
who
teach
them
not
to
understand
the
doctrine
of
repentance
faith
in
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
and
of
baptism
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost

laying
on

acknowledged

prophet

he
inquire
of

for

obtain

worthiness
has
not
inspired
us
to
make
this
request

our
unworthiness
we
have
unitedly
asked
god
our
heavenly
father
to
grant
unto
us
through
his
seer
a
revelation
of
his
mind
and
will
concerning

aquinas
of

school
of
theologians
rising

above
divines
of
his
day
teaches
in
his
summa
theologia
that
the
fire
of
hell
is
of
the
same
nature
as
ordinary
fire
though
with
different
properties
that
the
place
of
punishment
though
not
definitely
known
is
probably
under

he
also
taught
that
there
was
no
redemption
for
those
once
damned
their
punishment
is
to
be
eternal
coming
to
more
modern
times
we
read
in
the
westminster
confession
of
faith
adopted
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
the
puritan
party
in
england
the
following
on
the
subject
ch
xxxiii
the
wicked
who
know
not
god
and
obey
not
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
shall
be
cast
into
eternal
torment
and
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
from
the
glory
of
his
power
question
of
the
larger
catechism
and
the
answer
to
it
are
as
follows
what
are
the
punishments
of
sin
in
the
world
to
come
ans
the
punishments
of
sin
in
the
world
to
come
are
everlasting
separation
from
the
comfortable
presence
of
god
and
most
grievous
torment
in
soul
and
body
without
intermission
in

fire

the
westminster
confession
and
the

are
still

standards

an
exception
must
be
made
in
the
case
of
the
roman
catholic
church
catholics
do
not
believe
that
all
christians
at
death
go
immediately
into
heaven
but
on
the
contrary
believe
that
a
christian
who
dies
after
the
guilt
and
everlasting
punishment
of
mortal
sins
have
been
forgiven
him
but
who
either
from
want
of
opportunity
or
through
his
negligence
has
not
discharged
the
debt
of
temporal
punishment
due
to
his
sin
will
have
to
discharge
that
debt
to
the
justice
of
god
in
purgatory
purgatory
is
a
state
of
suffering
after
this
life
in
which
those
souls
are
for
a
time
detained
which
depart
this
life
after
their
deadly
sins
have
been
remitted
as
to
the
stain
and
guilt
and
as
to
the
everlasting
pain
that
was
due
to
them
but
which
souls
have
on
account
of
those
sins
still
some
temporal
punishment
to
pay
as
also
those
souls
which
leave
this
world
guilty
only
of
venial
pardonable
sins
in
purgatory
these
souls
are
purified
and
rendered
fit
to
enter
into

nothing
defiled

the

joseph
and

were
engaged
in
revising
the
jewish
scriptures
when
they
came
to
john

speaking
of

of

concerning
those
that
should
hear
the
voice
of
the
son

this
reading
of

caused

to
marvel

learning
who
shall
add
something
by

perhaps
from
that
germ
shall
come
a
profound
historian
a

to
sway
the
reason

passions
of
men

guide
them

better

from
such
a
germ
as
this
in
the
cradle
may
come
such
an
unfolding
of
power
as
we
see
in
the
highest

noblest
manhood
may
it
not
be
that
taking
that
highest
and
noblest
manhood
as
the
germ
that
from
it
may
come
under
the
guiding
hand
of
our
father
in
heaven
a
still
more
wonderful
unfolding
until
the
germ
of
highest

noblest
manhood
shall
develop
into
a

distance
between
the
noblest
man

the
position

a
god

greater
than
that
between
the
infant
in

highest
development

so
there
is
a
longer

arrive
