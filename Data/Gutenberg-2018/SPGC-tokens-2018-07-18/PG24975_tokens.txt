gift
by
charles
fontenay
could
well
have
been
montcalm
greatest
opportunity
a
chance
to
bring
mankind
priceless
gifts
from
worlds
beyond
but
montcalm
was
a
solid
family
man
and
what
about
that
nude
statue
in
the
park
it
was
one
of
those
rare
strokes
of
poetic
that
the
whole
business
occurred
the
morning
after
the
stormy
meeting
of
the
traskmore
censorship
board
like
the
good
general
he
was
richard
montcalm
had
foreseen
trouble
at
this
meeting
for
it
was
the
boldest
invasion
yet
into
the
territory
of
evil
and
laxity
his
forces
were
marshaled
several
of
the
ministers
who
had
been
with
him
on
other
issues
had
balked
on
this
one
but
he
had
three
of
them
present
as
well
as
heads
of
several
clubs
as
he
had
anticipated
the
irresponsible
liberals
were
present
to
do
battle
headed
by
patrick
levitt
this
board
said
levitt
in
his
strong
sarcastic
voice
has
gone
too
far
it
was
all
right
to
get
rid
of
the
actual
filth
and
everyone
will
agree
there
was
some
but
when
you
banned
the
sale
of
some
magazines
and
books
because
they
had
racy
covers
or
because
the
contents
were
a
little
too
sophisticated
to
suit
the
taste
of
members
of
this
board
well
you
can
carry
protection
of
our
youth
to
the
point
of
insulting
the
intelligence
of
adults
who
have
a
right
to
read
what
they
want
to
you
talking
about
something
that
already
in
the
past
levitt
said
montcalm
mildly
let
keep
to
the
issue
at
hand
you
wo
deny
that
children
see
this
indecent
statue
every
day
no
i
wo
deny
it
snapped
levitt
why
should
they
see
it
they
can
see
the
plate
of
the
original
in
the
encyclopaedia
it
a
fine
copy
of
a
work
of
art
montcalm
waited
for
some
rebuttal
from
his
supporters
but
none
was
forthcoming
on
this
matter
they
apparently
were
unwilling
to
go
farther
than
the
moral
backing
of
their
presence
i
do
not
consider
the
statue
of
a
naked
woman
art
even
if
it
is
called
he
said
bitingly
he
looked
at
his
two
colleagues
and
received
their
nods
of
acquiescence
he
ruled
the
statue
must
be
removed
from
the
park
and
from
public
view
levitt
had
one
parting
shot
would
it
solve
the
board
problem
if
we
put
a
brassiere
and
panties
on
the
statue
he
demanded
levitt
levity
is
not
amusing
the
board
has
ruled
said
montcalm
coldly
arising
to
signify
the
end
of
the
meeting
that
night
montcalm
slept
the
satisfied
sleep
of
the
just
he
awoke
shortly
after
dawn
to
find
a
strange
utterly
beautiful
naked
woman
in
his
bedroom
for
a
bemused
instant
montcalm
thought
the
statue
of
dawn
in
the
park
had
come
to
haunt
him
his
mouth
fell
open
but
he
was
unable
to
speak
take
me
to
your
president
said
the
naked
woman
musically
with
an
accent
that
could
have
been
martian
montcalm
awoke
what
that
what
is
it
richard
she
asked
sleepily
do
look
millie
exclaimed
montcalm
clapping
a
hand
over
her
eyes
nonsense
she
snapped
pushing
his
hand
aside
and
sitting
up
she
gasped
and
her
eyes
went
wide
and
in
an
instinctive
unreasonable
reaction
she
clutched
the
covers
up
around
her
own
nightgowned
bosom
who
are
you
young
woman
demanded
montcalm
indignantly
how
did
you
get
in
here
i
am
a
visitor
from
what
you
would
call
an
alien
planet
she
said
of
course
she
added
thoughtfully
it
is
alien
to
me
the
woman
mad
said
montcalm
to
his
wife
a
warning
noise
sounded
in
the
adjoining
bedroom
alarmed
he
instructed
go
and
keep
the
children
out
of
here
until
i
can
get
her
to
put
on
some
clothes
they
must
see
her
like
this
montcalm
got
out
of
bed
but
she
gave
her
husband
a
searching
glance
are
you
sure
i
can
trust
you
in
here
with
her
she
asked
millie
exclaimed
montcalm
sternly
shocked
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
left
the
room
when
the
door
closed
behind
her
he
turned
to
the
strange
woman
and
said
now
look
young
lady
i
get
you
one
of
millie
dresses
have
to
get
some
clothes
on
and
leave
are
you
going
to
ask
me
my
name
asked
the
woman
of
course
unpronounceable
to
you
but
i
thought
that
was
the
first
thing
all
earth
people
asked
of
visitors
from
other
planets
all
right
he
said
in
exasperation
what
your
name
she
said
an
unpronounceable
word
and
added
you
may
call
me
liz
montcalm
went
to
the
closet
and
found
one
of
millie
house
dresses
he
held
it
out
to
her
beseechingly
as
he
did
so
he
was
stricken
with
a
sudden
sharp
feeling
of
regret
that
she
must
don
it
her
figure
why
millie
had
never
had
a
figure
like
that
at
once
he
felt
ashamed
and
disloyal
and
sterner
than
ever
liz
rejected
the
proffered
garment
i
would
think
of
adopting
your
alien
custom
of
wearing
clothing
she
said
sweetly
now
look
said
montcalm
i
do
know
whether
you
drunk
or
crazy
but
you
going
to
have
to
put
something
on
and
get
out
of
here
before
i
call
the
police
i
anticipated
doubt
said
liz
i
prepared
to
prove
my
identity
with
the
words
the
two
of
them
were
no
longer
standing
in
the
montcalm
bedroom
but
in
a
broad
expanse
of
green
fields
and
woodland
unmarred
by
any
habitation
montcalm
did
recognize
the
spot
but
it
looked
vaguely
like
it
might
be
somewhere
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
montcalm
was
dismayed
to
find
that
he
was
as
naked
as
his
companion
oh
my
lord
he
exclaimed
trying
to
cover
himself
with
a
september
morn
pose
oh
i
sorry
apologized
liz
and
instantly
montcalm
pajamas
were
lying
at
his
feet
he
got
into
them
hurriedly
how
did
we
get
here
he
asked
his
astonished
curiosity
overcoming
his
disapproval
of
this
immodest
woman
by
a
mode
of
transportation
common
to
my
people
in
planetary
atmospheres
she
answered
it
one
of
the
things
i
propose
to
teach
your
people
she
sat
down
on
the
grass
montcalm
averted
his
eyes
like
the
gentleman
he
was
you
see
said
liz
the
people
of
your
world
are
on
the
verge
of
going
to
space
and
joining
the
community
of
worlds
it
only
natural
the
rest
of
us
should
wish
to
help
you
we
have
a
good
many
things
to
give
you
to
help
you
control
the
elements
and
natural
conditions
of
your
world
the
weather
for
example
suddenly
out
of
nowhere
a
small
cloud
appeared
above
them
and
spread
blocking
out
the
early
sun
it
began
to
rain
hard
the
rain
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
and
the
cloud
dissipated
montcalm
stood
shivering
in
his
soaked
pajamas
and
liz
got
to
her
feet
her
skin
glistening
with
moisture
you
have
a
problem
raising
food
for
your
population
in
some
areas
she
said
a
small
tree
near
them
suddenly
began
to
grow
at
an
amazing
rate
of
speed
it
doubled
its
size
in
three
minutes
put
forth
fruit
and
dropped
it
to
the
ground
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
things
i
give
to
your
planet
she
said
at
her
words
they
were
back
in
the
bedroom
this
time
she
had
been
thoughtful
montcalm
was
still
clad
in
wet
pajamas
i
do
know
what
sort
of
hypnosis
this
is
he
began
aggressively
but
you
ca
fool
me
young
lady
into
believing
millie
came
into
the
room
she
had
donned
a
robe
over
her
nightgown
richard
where
have
you
been
with
this
woman
she
demanded
why
my
dear
you
been
roaming
around
the
house
somewhere
with
her
i
came
in
here
a
moment
ago
and
you
were
gone
now
richard
i
want
you
to
do
something
about
her
and
stop
fooling
around
i
ca
keep
the
children
in
their
room
all
day
it
had
been
hypnosis
then
liz
was
for
real
a
vision
rose
before
montcalm
of
mankind
given
wonders
powers
benefits
representing
advances
of
thousands
of
years
the
world
could
become
a
paradise
with
the
things
she
offered
to
teach
millie
this
woman
from
another
planet
he
exclaimed
excitedly
and
turned
to
liz
why
did
you
choose
me
to
contact
on
earth
why
i
happened
to
land
near
your
house
she
answered
i
know
how
your
primitive
social
organization
is
set
up
but
is
one
human
being
just
as
good
as
another
to
lead
me
to
the
proper
authorities
yes
he
said
joyfully
visualizing
black
headlines
and
his
picture
in
the
papers
millie
stood
to
one
side
puzzled
and
grim
at
once
montcalm
picked
up
the
house
dress
he
had
taken
from
the
closet
earlier
now
miss
he
said
if
you
just
put
this
on
i
take
you
to
the
mayor
and
he
can
get
in
touch
with
washington
at
once
i
told
you
said
liz
i
do
want
to
adopt
your
custom
of
wearing
clothing
but
you
ca
go
out
in
public
like
that
said
the
dismayed
montcalm
if
you
going
to
move
among
earth
people
you
must
dress
as
we
do
my
people
would
demand
that
earth
people
disrobe
to
associate
with
us
she
countered
reasonably
millie
had
had
enough
she
went
into
action
you
can
argue
with
this
hussy
all
you
like
richard
but
i
going
to
call
the
police
she
said
and
left
the
room
with
determination
in
her
eye
the
next
fifteen
minutes
were
agonizing
for
montcalm
as
he
tried
futilely
to
get
liz
to
dress
like
a
decent
person
he
was
torn
between
realization
of
what
the
things
she
offered
would
mean
to
the
world
and
his
own
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
his
children
the
children
of
traskmore
the
children
of
the
world
what
would
be
the
effect
on
their
tender
morals
to
realize
that
a
sane
adult
was
willing
to
walk
around
in
brazen
nakedness
there
was
a
pounding
on
the
front
door
and
the
voice
of
millie
inviting
the
law
into
the
house
now
i
afraid
you
due
to
go
to
jail
said
montcalm
mournfully
but
when
they
get
some
clothes
on
you
i
try
to
explain
it
and
get
you
an
audience
with
the
mayor
two
policemen
entered
the
room
one
policeman
took
the
house
dress
from
montcalm
lax
fingers
and
tossed
it
over
liz
head
without
further
ado
liz
did
not
struggle
she
looked
at
montcalm
with
a
quizzical
expression
i
sorry
she
said
my
people
made
a
mistake
if
you
earth
people
are
tolerant
enough
to
accept
a
difference
in
customs
of
dress
afraid
you
too
immature
with
that
she
was
gone
like
a
puff
of
air
the
astonished
policemen
held
an
empty
dress
montcalm
did
see
the
flying
saucer
that
whizzed
over
traskmore
that
morning
and
disappeared
into
the
sky
but
he
did
doubt
the
reports
he
debated
with
himself
for
a
long
time
whether
he
had
taken
the
right
attitude
but
decided
he
had
after
all
there
were
the
children
to
consider
the
end
