sidenote
space
was
electrified
as
that
harsh
challenge
rang
out
but
john
endlich
hesitated
for
he
saw
beyond
his
own
murder
saw
the
horror
and
destruction
his
death
would
unleash
and
knew
he
dared
not
fight
back
the
space
ship
landed
briefly
and
john
endlich
lifted
the
huge
asteroids
homesteaders
office
box
which
contained
everything
from
a
prefabricated
house
to
toothbrushes
for
his
family
down
from
the
without
help
or
visible
effort
in
the
tiny
gravity
of
the
asteroid
vesta
doing
this
was
no
trouble
at
all
but
beyond
this
point
the
situation
was
bitter
his
two
kids
bubs
seven
and
evelyn
nine
clad
in
that
were
slightly
oversize
to
allow
for
the
growth
of
young
bodies
were
both
bawling
he
could
hear
them
through
his
radiophones
around
him
under
the
airless
sky
of
space
stretched
desolation
that
he
of
course
known
about
beforehand
but
which
now
had
assumed
that
special
and
terrible
starkness
of
reality
at
his
elbow
his
wife
rose
her
face
and
grey
eyes
framed
by
the
wide
of
her
armor
was
trying
desperately
to
choke
back
tears
and
be
brave
remember
we
to
make
good
here
johnny
she
was
saying
remember
what
the
homesteaders
office
people
told
us
that
with
modern
equipment
and
the
right
frame
of
mind
life
can
be
nice
out
here
worked
on
other
asteroids
what
if
we
are
the
first
farmers
to
come
to
vesta
do
listen
to
those
crazy
miners
they
just
kidding
us
do
listen
to
them
and
do
for
gosh
sakes
get
sore
rose
words
were
now
like
dim
echoes
of
his
conscience
and
of
his
recent
grim
determination
to
master
his
hot
temper
his
sensitiveness
his
wanderlust
and
his
penchant
for
poker
and
the
social
glass
qualities
of
an
otherwise
agreeable
and
industrious
nature
that
on
earth
had
always
been
his
undoing
recently
back
in
illinois
he
had
even
spent
six
months
in
jail
for
all
but
inflicting
murder
with
his
bare
fists
on
a
bullying
neighbor
whom
he
had
caught
whipping
a
horse
sure
but
during
those
six
months
his
farm
the
fifth
he
tried
to
run
in
scattered
parts
of
north
america
had
gone
to
weeds
in
spite
of
rose
valiant
efforts
to
take
care
of
it
alone
oh
yes
the
lessons
of
all
that
past
personal
history
should
be
strong
in
his
mind
but
now
will
power
and
rose
frightened
tones
of
wisdom
both
seemed
to
fade
away
in
his
brain
as
jeering
words
from
another
source
continued
to
drive
jagged
splinters
into
the
weakest
portion
of
his
soul
hi
you
hydroponic
how
yuh
like
your
new
claim
nice
ai
it
how
about
some
fresh
turnips

take
our
money
wifey
boy
let
make
him
sociable
hydroponic
it
was
a
medley
of
coarse
voices
and
laughter
matching
the
row
of
a
dozen
coarse
faces
and
grins
that
lined
the
of
the
ship
these
men
were
asteroid
miners
and
been
back
to
earth
for
a
while
to
raise
hell
and
freshen
up
and
spend
the
money
in
their
pockets
coming
out
again
from
earth
across
the
orbit
of
mars
to
the
asteroid
belt
they
had
had
the
endlichs
as
fellow
passengers
john
endlich
had
battled
valiantly
with
his
feebler
side
and
with
his
social
inclinations
all
through
that
long
dreary
voyage
to
keep
clear
of
the
inevitable
griefs
that
were
sure
to
come
to
a
chap
like
himself
from
involvement
with
such
characters
in
the
main
it
had
been
a
rather
tattered
victory
but
now
at
the
final
moment
of
bleak
anticlimax
they
took
their
revenge
in
guffaws
and
ridicule
hurling
the
noise
at
him
through
the
radiophones
of
the
helmets
that
they
held
in
their
laps
being
always
kept
handy
beneath
the
of
every
interplanetary
vessel
drop
over
to
our
camp
sometime
for
a
little
drink
and
a
little
game
eh
pantywaist
tai
far
sure
just
drop
in
on
us
when
the
pressure
of
domesticity
in
this
beootiful
country
gets
you
down
when
the
turnips
get
you
down
bring
the
wife
along
she
kinda
pretty
ought
to
have
a
fella
just
ask
for
me
alf
neely
yeah
alf
neely
was
the
loudest
and
the
ugliest
of
john
baiters
he
had
gigantic
arms
and
shoulders
small
squinty
eyes
and
a
pendulous
nose
and
the
others
yelling
and
hooting
made
it
a
pack
man
do
he
wish
he
was
back
in
podunk
what
no
tomatas
dutch
what
did
they
tell
yuh
back
at
the
homestead
office
in
chicago
that
we
were
in
need
of
fresh
vegetables
out
here
well
where
are
they
papa
under
the
barrage
john
endlich
last
shreds
of
were
all
but
blotted
out
by
the
red
murk
of
fury
he
was
small
and
broad
a
years
old
but
now
his
round
and
usually
placid
face
was
as
red
as
a
fiery
moon
and
his
underlip
curled
in
a
snarl
he
might
have
taken
the
savage
ribbing
more
calmly
but
there
was
too
much
grim
fact
behind
what
these
asteroid
miners
said
besides
out
here
he
had
thought
that
he
would
have
a
better
chance
to
lick
the
weaknesses
in
himself
because
he
to
work
to
keep
his
family
alive
because
he
been
told
that
there
be
no
one
around
to
distract
him
from
duty
yah
the
irony
of
that
now
was
maddening
for
the
moment
john
endlich
was
speechless
and
strangled
but
like
an
ignited
firecracker
uhunh
ready
to
explode
his
hard
body
hunched
as
if
ready
to
spring
and
the
baiting
waxed
louder
it
was
like
the
yammering
of
crows
or
the
roar
of
a
wild
surf
in
his
ears
then
came
the
last
straw
the
kids
had
kept
on
bawling
more
and
more
violently
but
now
they
got
down
to
verbal
explanations
of
what
they
thought
was
the
matter
papa
we
the
timing
could
not
have
been
better
or
worse
the
shrieks
and
howls
of
mirth
from
the
miners
a
moment
ago
were
as
nothing
to
what
they
were
now
tell
it
to
daddy
kids
that
was
a
mouthful
wow
there
is
a
point
at
which
an
extremity
of
masculine
embarrassment
can
lead
to
but
one
thing
mayhem
whether
the
latter
is
to
be
inflicted
on
the
attacked
or
the
attacker
remains
the
only
question
mark
i
get
you
alf
neely
endlich
snarled
right
now
and
i
get
all
the
damned
rest
of
you
guys
endlich
was
hardly
lacking
in
vigor
himself
like
a
squat
but
streamlined
fighting
rooster
rendered
a
hundred
times
more
agile
by
the
puny
gravity
he
would
have
reached
the
threshold
in
a
single
lithe
skip
had
not
rose
despairing
grabbed
him
around
the
middle
to
restrain
him
together
they
slid
several
yards
across
the
surface
of
the
asteroid
do
johnny
please
do
she
wailed
her
begging
could
not
have
stopped
him
nor
could
her
physical
interference
for
more
than
an
instant
nor
could
his
conscience
nor
his
recent
determination
to
keep
out
of
trouble
not
the
certainty
of
being
torn
limb
from
limb
and
not
hell
itself
could
have
held
him
back
anymore
then
yet
he
was
brought
to
a
halt
it
certainly
was
cowardice
that
accomplished
this
no
suddenly
there
was
no
laughter
among
the
miners
but
in
a
body
they
arose
from
their
aboard
the
ship
suddenly
there
was
no
more
humor
in
their
faces
beyond
the
they
were
itching
to
be
assaulted
the
glitter
in
alf
neely
small
eyes
was
about
as
reassuring
as
the
glitter
in
the
eyes
of
a
slightly
prankish
gorilla
we
waitin
for
yuh
civilization
he
rumbled
softly
after
that
all
space
was
still
electrified
the
icy
stars
gleamed
in
the
black
sky
the
shrunken
sun
looked
on
and
john
endlich
saw
beyond
his
own
murder
to
the
thought
of
his
kids
and
his
wife
left
alone
out
here
hundreds
of
millions
of
miles
from
earth
and
real
law
and
order
with
these
lugs
these
guys
who
had
been
starved
emotionally
and
warped
inside
by
raw
space
coldness
crawled
into
john
endlich
guts
and
seemed
to
twist
steel
hooks
there
making
him
sick
the
silence
of
a
vacuum
and
of
unthinkable
distances
and
of
ghostly
remains
which
must
be
left
on
this
fragment
of
a
world
that
had
blown
up
maybe
fifty
million
or
more
years
ago
added
its
weight
to
john
endlich
feelings
and
for
his
family
he
was
scared
what
hell
could
not
have
accomplished
became
fact
his
almost
suicidal
impulse
to
inflict
violence
on
his
tormenters
was
strangled
brutally
repressed
and
left
to
impose
the
pangs
of
neurosis
on
his
tormented
soul
narrowing
domesticity
had
won
a
battle
except
of
course
that
what
he
had
already
said
to
alf
neely
and
friends
was
sufficient
to
start
the
juggernaut
that
they
represented
rolling
as
he
picked
himself
and
rose
up
from
the
ground
he
saw
that
the
miners
were
grimly
donning
their
in
preparation
to
their
coming
out
of
the
ship
to
lay
him
low
oh
tired
hunh
alf
neely
growled
it
do
matter
dutch
we
finish
you
off
without
you
liftin
a
finger
in
john
endlich
the
rage
of
intolerable
insults
still
seethed
but
there
was
no
question
now
of
outcome
between
it
and
the
brassy
taste
of
danger
on
his
tongue
he
knew
that
even
knuckling
down
and
changing
from
man
to
worm
to
take
back
his
fighting
words
could
do
any
good
he
felt
like
a
martyr
left
with
his
family
in
a
roman
arena
while
the
lions
approached
his
butchery
was
as
good
as
over
reprieve
came
presumably
by
way
of
the
of
the
pilot
of
the
space
ship
the
was
closed
abruptly
by
a
mechanism
that
could
be
operated
only
from
the
main
the
rocket
jets
of
the
craft
emitted
a
single
weak
burst
of
flame
like
a
boulder
grown
agile
and
flighty
the
ship
leaped
from
the
landscape
and
arced
outward
toward
the
stars
to
curve
around
the
asteroid
and
disappear
behind
the
scene
jagged
brim
the
craft
had
gone
to
make
its
next
and
final
stop
among
the
of
the
huge
mining
camp
on
the
other
side
of
vesta
the
side
of
torn
rocks
and
rich
radioactive
ores
but
before
the
ship
had
vanished
from
sight
john
endlich
heard
alf
neely
grim
promise
in
his
helmet
radiophones
we
be
back
tonight
greenhorn
lots
of
times
we
work
when
it
daytime
on
this
side
of
vesta
we
be
free
stick
around
i
rub
what
left
of
you
in
the
dust
of
your
claim
endlich
was
alone
then
with
the
fright
in
his
wife
eyes
the
squalling
of
his
children
and
his
own
abysmal
disgust
and
worry
for
once
he
ceased
to
be
a
gentle
parent
bubs
evelyn
he
snapped
the
startled
silence
which
ensued
was
his
first
personal
victory
on
vesta
but
the
silence
itself
was
an
insidious
enemy
it
made
his
ears
ring
it
made
even
his
audible
pulsebeats
seemed
to
ache
it
bored
into
his
nerves
like
a
drill
when
after
a
moment
rose
spoke
quaveringly
he
was
almost
grateful
what
do
we
do
johnny
we
still
got
to
do
what
we
supposed
to
do
do
we
whereupon
john
endlich
allowed
himself
the
luxury
and
the
slight
relief
of
a
torrent
of
silent
cussing
inside
his
head
damn
the
obvious
questions
of
women
damn
the
miners
damn
the
the
asteroids
homesteaders
office
and
their
corny
slogans
and
posters
meant
to
hook
suckers
like
himself
damn
his
own
dumb
hide
damn
the
mighty
urge
to
get
drunk
damn
all
the
bitter
circumstances
that
made
doing
so
impossible
damn
damn
damn
finished
with
this
orgy
he
said
meekly
i
guess
so
hon
all
members
of
the
endlich
family
had
been
looking
around
them
at
the
weird
vestal
landscape
through
john
endlich
mind
again
there
flashed
a
picture
of
what
this
asteroid
was
like
at
the
asteroids
school
in
chicago
where
his
dependents
and
he
had
been
given
several
weeks
of
orientation
instruction
suitable
to
their
separate
needs
he
had
been
shown
diagrams
and
photographs
of
vesta
later
he
had
of
course
seen
it
from
space
it
was
not
round
like
a
major
planet
or
most
moons
rather
it
was
like
a
or
even
more
like
a
shard
of
a
gigantic
broken
vase
it
was
several
hundred
miles
long
and
half
as
thick
one
side
of
it
this
side
was
curved
for
it
had
been
a
segment
of
the
surface
of
the
shattered
planet
from
which
all
of
the
asteroids
had
come
the
other
side
was
jagged
and
broken
for
it
had
been
torn
from
the
mesoderm
of
that
tortured
mother
world
from
the
desolation
of
his
own
thoughts
in
which
the
of
alf
neely
lurked
with
its
pendent
promise
of
catastrophe
soon
to
come
and
from
his
own
view
of
other
desolation
all
around
him
john
endlich
was
suddenly
distracted
by
the
comments
of
his
kids
all
at
once
conforming
to
the
changeable
weather
of
children
natures
regardless
of
circumstance
their
mood
had
once
more
turned
bright
and
adventurous
look
pop
bubs
chirped
his
round
red
face
beaming
now
from
his
helmet
in
spite
of
his
undried
tears
this
land
all
around
here
was
fields
once
you
can
even
see
the
rows
of
some
kind
of
stubble
like
and
over
there
a
a
almost
like
a
fence
an
up
there
is
hills
with
trees
on
some
of
not
even
knocked
over
but
everything
is
all
and
black
and
grey
and
dead
gosh
we
can
see
all
that
dopey
evelyn
who
was
older
snapped
at
bubs
we
know
that
something
like
people
lived
on
a
regular
planet
here
awful
long
ago
why
do
you
look
over
the
other
way
there
the
house
and
maybe
the
barn
and
the
sheds
and
the
old
garden
bubs
turned
around
his
eyes
got
very
big
oh
he
gasped
in
wonder
pop
mom
look
do
you
see
yeah
we
see
bubs
john
endlich
answered
for
a
long
moment
he
been
staring
at
those
blocklike
structures
one
maybe
the
house
was
of
grey
stone
it
had
odd
triangular
windows
which
may
once
have
been
glazed
some
of
the
others
were
of
a
blackened
material
perhaps
cellulose
wood
that
is
all
of
the
buildings
were
pushed
askew
and
partly
crumpled
from
top
to
bottom
like
great
cardboard
cartons
that
had
been
half
crushed
endlich
imagination
seemed
forced
to
follow
a
groove
trying
to
picture
that
last
terrible
moment
years
ago
had
the
blast
been
caused
by
natural
atomic
forces
at
the
heart
of
the
planet
as
one
theory
claimed
or
had
a
great
bomb
as
large
as
an
oversized
meteor
come
from
space
to
bury
itself
deep
in
that
ancient
world
a
world
as
big
as
mars
its
possible
enemy
whose
weird
inhabitants
had
been
wiped
out
in
a
less
spectacular
way
perhaps
in
the
same
conflict
endlich
mind
grabbed
at
that
brief
instant
of
explosion
the
awful
jolt
which
must
have
ended
all
consciousness
and
all
capacity
for
eyes
to
see
what
followed
perhaps
there
was
a
short
and
terrible
passing
of
flame
but
in
swift
seconds
great
chunks
of
the
planet
crust
must
have
been
hurled
outward
in
a
moment
the
flame
must
have
died
dissipated
with
the
suddenly
vanishing
atmosphere
into
the
cold
vacuum
of
the
void
almost
instantly
the
sky
which
had
been
deep
blue
before
must
have
turned
to
its
present
black
with
the
voidal
stars
blazing
there
had
been
no
air
left
to
sustain
combustion
so
buildings
and
trees
had
not
continued
to
burn
if
there
had
been
time
at
all
to
ignite
them
and
with
the
same
swiftness
all
remaining
artifacts
and
surface
features
of
this
chip
of
a
world
crust
that
was
vesta
had
been
plunged
into
the
dual
preservatives
of
the
interplanetary
regions
and
all
but
absolute
dryness
yes
the
motion
of
the
few
scattered
molecules
in
space
was
very
fast
indicating
a
high
temperature
but
without
substance
to
be
hot
there
can
be
no
heat
and
so
few
molecules
were
there
in
the
void
that
while
the
concept
of
a
hot
space
remained
true
it
became
tangled
at
once
with
the
fact
that
a
complete
vacuum
can
have
no
temperature
which
meant
again
in
practice
all
but
absolute
zero
john
endlich
knew
he
heard
the
lectures
at
the
homesteaders
school
here
was
a
hundreds
of
square
miles
in
extent
a
region
that
had
been
shifted
in
a
few
seconds
from
the
full
prime
of
life
and
motion
to
moveless
and
timeless
silence
it
was
like
the
mummy
of
a
man
in
its
presence
there
was
a
chill
a
revulsion
and
yet
a
fascination
the
kids
continued
to
jabber
more
excitedly
now
than
before
pop
mom
bubs
urged
let
go
look
inside
them
buildings
maybe
the
are
still
there
the
people
i
mean
all
black
and
dried
up
like
the
one
in
the
showcase
at
school
four
tentacles
they
had
instead
of
arms
and
legs
the
teacher
said
sure
let
go
evelyn
joined
in
i
not
scared
to
yeah
kids
tastes
could
be
pretty
gruesome
when
you
thought
most
that
you
had
to
shelter
them
from
horror
they
were
less
bothered
by
it
than
you
were
john
endlich
lips
made
a
sour
line
stay
here
the
pair
of
you
rose
ordered
aw
mom
evelyn
began
to
protest
you
heard
me
the
first
time
their
mother
answered
john
endlich
moved
to
the
great
box
which
had
come
with
them
from
earth
the
nervous
tension
that
tore
at
him
unpleasant
and
chilling
driving
him
toward
straining
effort
was
more
than
the
result
of
the
shameful
and
embarrassing
memory
of
his
very
recent
trouble
with
alf
neely
and
companions
and
the
certainty
of
more
trouble
to
come
from
that
source
for
there
was
another
and
even
worse
enemy
endlich
knew
what
it
was
the
awful
silence
he
still
looked
shamefaced
and
furious
but
now
he
felt
a
gentler
sharing
of
circumstances
we
let
the
snooping
go
till
later
kids
he
growled
right
now
we
got
ta
do
what
we
got
ta
do
the
youngsters
seemed
to
join
up
with
his
mood
as
he
tore
the
pinchbar
which
had
been
conveniently
attached
to
the
side
of
the
box
free
of
its
staples
and
proceeded
to
break
out
supplies
their
whimsical
musings
fell
close
to
what
he
was
thinking
vesta
evelyn
said
they
told
us
at
school
remember
vesta
was
the
old
roman
goddess
of
hearth
and
home
funny
hunh
dad
bubs
fancy
was
vivid
too
look
pop
he
said
again
pointing
to
a
ribbon
of
what
might
be
concrete
cracked
and
crumpled
as
by
a
terrific
quake
curving
away
toward
the
hills
and
the
broken
mountains
beyond
that
was
a
road
ca
you
almost
hear
some
kinda
cars
and
trucks
by
john
endlich
wife
helping
him
open
the
great
box
also
had
things
to
say
in
spite
of
the
worry
showing
in
her
face
she
touched
the
dessicated
soil
with
a
gauntleted
hand
johnny
she
remarked
wonderingly
you
can
see
the
of
the
last
rain
that
ever
fell
here
yeah
endlich
growled
without
any
further
comment
inside
himself
he
was
fighting
the
battle
of
lost
things
the
blue
sky
the
shifting
beauty
of
clouds
in
sunshine
the
warm
whisper
of
wind
in
trees
the
rattle
of
traffic
the
babble
of
water
the
buzz
of
insects
the
smell
of
flowers
the
sight
of
grass
waving
in
short
all
the
evidences
of
life
a
lot
of
things
that
was
here
once
we
bring
back
wo
we
pop
bubs
questioned
with
astonishing
maturity
hope
so
john
endlich
answered
keeping
his
doubts
hidden
behind
gruffness
maybe
it
was
a
grim
joke
that
here
and
now
every
force
in
himself
was
concentrated
on
substantial
objectives
to
the
exclusion
of
his
defects
the
drive
in
him
was
to
end
the
maddening
silence
and
to
rub
out
the
mood
of
harsh
barrenness
and
his
own
aching
homesickness
by
struggling
to
bring
back
a
little
beauty
of
scenery
and
a
little
of
living
motion
it
was
a
civilized
urge
a
urge
maybe
a
narrow
urge
but
how
could
anybody
stand
being
here
very
long
unless
such
things
were
done
if
they
ever
could
be
maybe
willfully
he
had
led
himself
into
a
grimmer
trap
than
it
had
even
seemed
to
be
or
than
he
had
ever
wanted
inside
his
space
suit
he
had
begun
to
sweat
furiously
and
it
was
more
because
of
the
tension
of
his
nerves
than
because
of
the
vigor
with
which
he
plied
his
pinchbar
doing
the
first
task
which
had
to
be
done
steel
ribbons
were
snapped
nails
were
yanked
silently
from
the
great
box
boards
were
jerked
loose
in
another
minute
john
endlich
and
his
wife
were
setting
up
an
airtight
tent
which
when
the
time
came
could
be
inflated
from
bottles
they
worked
somewhat
awkwardly
for
their
instruction
period
had
been
brief
and
they
were
green
but
the
job
was
speedily
finished
the
first
requirement
shelter
was
assured
digging
again
into
the
vast
and
varied
contents
of
the
box
john
endlich
found
some
things
he
had
not
expected
a
fine
rifle
a
pistol
and
ammunition
at
which
moment
an
ironic
imp
seemed
to
sit
on
his
shoulder
and
laugh
derisively
the
asteroids
homesteaders
office
had
filled
these
boxes
according
to
a
precise
survey
of
the
needs
of
a
peaceful
settler
on
vesta
it
was
like
bubs
with
the
inquisitiveness
of
a
to
ask
what
did
they
think
we
needed
guns
for
when
they
knew
there
was
no
rabbits
to
shoot
at
i
guess
they
kind
of
suspected
there
be
guys
like
alf
neely
son
john
endlich
answered
dryly
even
if
they
did
tell
us
about
it
the
next
task
prescribed
by
the
homesteaders
school
was
to
secure
a
supply
of
air
and
water
in
quantity
again
following
the
instructions
they
had
received
the
endlichs
uncrated
and
set
up
an
drill
in
an
hour
it
had
bored
to
a
depth
of
feet
hauling
up
the
drill
endlich
lowered
an
electric
heating
unit
on
a
cable
from
an
atomic
and
then
capped
the
casing
pipe
yes
strangely
enough
there
was
still
sufficient
water
beneath
the
surface
of
vesta
its
parent
planet
like
the
earth
had
had
water
in
its
crust
that
could
be
tapped
by
means
of
wells
and
so
suddenly
had
vesta
been
chilled
in
the
cold
of
space
at
the
time
of
the
parent
explosion
that
this
water
had
not
had
a
chance
to
dissipate
itself
as
vapor
into
the
void
but
had
been
frozen
solid
the
drying
soil
above
it
had
formed
a
tough
shell
which
had
protected
the
ice
beneath
from
disappearance
through
sublimation
drill
down
to
it
melt
it
with
heat
and
it
was
water
again
ready
to
be
pumped
and
put
to
use
and
water
by
electrolysis
was
also
an
easy
source
of
oxygen
to
breathe
the
soil
once
thawed
over
a
few
acres
would
also
yield
considerable
nitrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
the
makings
of
many
cubic
meters
of
atmosphere
the
survey
expeditions
here
on
vesta
and
on
other
similar
asteroids
which
were
crustal
chips
of
the
original
planet
had
done
their
work
well
pathfinding
a
means
of
survival
here
when
john
endlich
pumped
the
first
turbid
liquid
which
immediately
froze
again
in
the
surface
cold
he
might
under
other
better
circumstances
have
felt
like
cheering
his
well
was
a
success
but
his
tense
mind
was
racing
far
ahead
to
all
the
endless
tasks
that
were
yet
to
be
done
to
make
any
sense
at
all
out
of
his
claim
besides
the
short
day
eighteen
hours
long
instead
of
and
already
far
advanced
at
the
time
of
his
tumultuous
landing
was
drawing
to
a
close
it
be
dark
here
mighty
quick
johnny
rose
said
she
was
looking
scared
again
john
endlich
considered
setting
up
floodlights
and
working
on
through
the
hours
of
darkness
but
such
lights
would
be
a
dangerous
beacon
for
prowlers
and
when
you
were
inside
their
area
of
illumination
it
was
difficult
to
see
into
the
gloom
beyond
still
one
did
not
know
if
the
mask
of
darkness
did
not
afford
a
greater
invitation
to
those
with
evil
intent
for
a
long
moment
endlich
was
in
an
agony
of
indecision
then
he
said
we
knock
off
from
work
now
get
in
the
tent
eat
supper
maybe
sleep
but
he
was
remembering
neely
promise
to
return
tonight
in
another
minute
the
small
but
dazzling
sun
had
disappeared
behind
the
broken
mountains
as
vesta
unspherical
and
malformed
tumbled
rather
than
rotated
on
its
center
of
gravity
and
several
hours
later
amid
heavy
cooking
odors
inside
the
now
inflated
plastic
bubble
that
was
the
tent
endlich
was
sprawled
on
his
stomach
unable
through
worry
even
to
remove
his
space
suit
or
to
allow
his
family
to
do
so
though
there
was
breathable
air
around
them
they
lay
with
their
helmet
open
rose
and
evelyn
breathed
evenly
in
peaceful
sleep
bubs
trying
to
be
very
much
a
man
battled
slumber
and
yawns
and
kept
his
dad
company
with
scraps
of
conversation
let
come
pop
he
said
cheerfully
hope
they
do
we
shoot
all
wo
we
pop
you
got
the
rifle
and
the
pistol
ready
pop
yes
john
endlich
had
his
guns
ready
beside
him
all
right
for
what
it
was
worth
he
wished
wryly
that
things
could
be
as
simple
as
his
son
seemed
to
think
thank
the
lord
that
bubs
was
so
trusting
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
the
prankish
and
savage
nature
of
certain
kinds
of
men
with
liquor
in
their
bellies
being
what
it
was
for
john
endlich
having
been
on
occasion
mildly
kindred
to
such
men
was
well
able
to
understand
that
nature
and
understanding
now
chilled
his
blood
peering
from
the
small
plastic
windows
of
the
tent
he
kept
watching
for
hulking
black
shapes
to
silhouette
themselves
against
the
stars
and
he
listened
on
his
helmet
phones
for
scraps
of
telltale
conversation
exchanged
by
radio
by
men
in
space
armor
once
he
thought
he
heard
a
grunt
or
a
malicious
chuckle
but
it
may
have
been
just
vagrant
static
otherwise
from
all
around
the
stillness
of
the
vacuum
was
absolute
it
was
unnerving
on
this
airless
piece
of
a
planet
an
enemy
could
sneak
up
on
you
almost
without
stealth
against
that
maddening
silence
however
bubs
presently
had
a
helpful
and
unprompted
suggestion
hey
pop
he
whispered
hoarsely
put
the
side
of
your
helmet
against
the
and
listen
john
endlich
obeyed
his
kid
in
a
second
cold
sweat
began
to
break
out
on
his
body
as
intermittent
thudding
noises
reached
his
ear
in
the
absence
of
an
atmosphere
sounds
could
still
be
transmitted
through
the
solid
substance
of
the
asteroid
it
took
endlich
a
moment
to
realize
that
the
noises
came
not
from
nearby
but
from
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
vesta
the
thudding
was
vibrated
straight
through
many
miles
of
solid
rock
it
nothing
bubs
he
growled
nothing
but
the
blasting
in
the
mines
bubs
said
oh
as
if
disappointed
not
long
thereafter
he
was
asleep
leaving
his
harrassed
sire
to
endure
the
vigil
alone
endlich
dared
not
doze
off
to
rest
a
little
even
for
a
moment
he
could
only
wait
if
an
evil
visitation
came
as
he
had
been
all
but
sure
it
must
that
would
be
bad
indeed
if
it
did
come
well
that
still
meant
a
sleepless
night
and
the
postponement
of
the
inevitable
he
could
win
thus
the
hours
slipped
away
until
the
luminous
dial
of
the
clock
in
the
tent
it
had
been
synchronized
to
vestal
time
told
him
that
dawn
was
near
that
was
when
through
the
ground
he
heard
the
faint
scraping
a
rustle
it
might
have
been
made
by
heavy
it
came
and
then
it
stopped
it
came
again
and
stopped
once
more
as
if
skulking
forms
paused
to
find
their
way
out
where
the
ancient
and
ghostly
buildings
were
he
saw
a
star
wink
out
briefly
as
if
a
shape
blocked
the
path
of
its
light
then
it
burned
peacefully
again
john
endlich
hackles
rose
his
fists
tightened
on
both
his
rifle
and
pistol
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
great
box
looming
blackly
the
box
that
contained
the
means
of
survival
for
his
family
and
himself
as
if
he
foresaw
the
future
a
moment
away
for
suddenly
huge
as
it
was
the
box
rocked
and
began
to
move
off
as
if
it
had
sprouted
legs
and
come
alive
john
endlich
scrambled
to
action
he
slammed
and
sealed
the
of
the
helmets
of
the
members
of
his
family
to
protect
them
from
suffocation
he
did
the
same
for
himself
and
then
unzipped
the
he
darted
out
with
the
outrushing
air
this
was
a
moment
with
murder
poised
in
every
tattered
fragment
of
it
john
endlich
knew
murder
was
engrained
in
his
own
nerves
that
raged
to
destroy
the
trespassers
whose
pranks
had
passed
the
level
of
practical
humor
and
become
by
the
tampering
with
vital
necessities
an
attack
on
life
itself
but
there
was
a
more
immediate
menace
in
these
roughnecks
strike
back
at
them
even
in
and
have
it
proven
he
had
not
the
faintest
doubt
who
they
were
even
though
he
could
not
see
their
faces
in
the
blackness
maybe
he
should
lay
low
let
them
have
their
way
but
how
could
he
even
apart
from
his
raging
temper
and
his
honor
as
a
man
when
they
were
making
off
with
his
family
and
his
own
means
of
survival
he
had
to
throw
rose
and
the
kids
into
the
balance
risking
them
to
the
danger
that
he
knew
lay
beyond
his
own
possible
ignoble
demise
he
did
just
that
when
he
raised
his
pistol
struggling
against
the
awful
impulse
of
the
rage
in
him
lifted
it
high
enough
so
that
the
explosive
bullets
that
spewed
from
it
would
be
sure
to
pass
over
the
heads
of
the
dark
silhouettes
that
were
moving
about
damn
you
neely
endlich
yelled
into
his
helmet
mike
his
finger
tightening
on
the
trigger
drop
that
stuff
at
that
moment
the
sun
rim
appeared
at
the
landscape
jagged
edge
and
on
this
side
of
airless
vesta
complete
night
was
transformed
to
complete
day
as
abruptly
as
if
a
switch
had
been
turned
alf
neely
and
john
endlich
blinked
at
each
other
maybe
neely
was
embarrassed
a
little
by
his
sudden
exposure
but
if
he
was
it
show
probably
the
bully
in
him
was
scared
but
this
he
covered
in
a
common
manner
with
a
studiedly
easy
swagger
and
a
bravado
that
was
not
good
sense
but
bordered
on
childish
recklessness
yet
he
had
a
trump
card
by
the
aggressive
glint
in
his
eyes
and
his
unpleasant
grin
endlich
knew
that
neely
knew
that
he
was
afraid
for
his
wife
and
would
start
anything
unless
driven
and
goaded
sheerly
wild
even
now
they
were
seven
to
his
one
why
good
morning
neighbor
neely
crooned
his
voice
a
burlesque
of
sweetness
glad
to
oblige
he
hurled
the
great
box
down
as
he
did
so
something
glinted
in
his
gloved
paw
he
flicked
it
expertly
into
the
open
side
of
the
wooden
case
which
contained
so
many
things
that
were
vital
to
the
endlichs
it
was
only
a
tiny
nuclear
and
the
blast
was
feeble
even
so
the
box
burst
apart
splintered
crates
sealed
cans
great
torn
bundles
and
what
not
went
skittering
far
across
the
plain
in
every
direction
or
were
hurled
high
toward
the
stars
to
begin
falling
at
last
with
the
laziness
of
a
descending
feather
neely
and
his
companions
had
attempted
to
move
out
of
the
way
of
the
explosion
they
only
rolled
with
its
force
protected
by
their
space
suits
endlich
rolled
too
helplessly
clutching
his
pistol
and
rifle
still
by
some
superhuman
effort
he
managed
to
regain
his
feet
before
the
far
more
practiced
neely
who
was
hampered
no
doubt
by
a
few
too
many
drinks
had
even
stopped
rolling
but
when
neely
got
up
he
had
drawn
his
blaster
a
useful
tool
of
his
trade
but
a
hellish
weapon
too
at
short
range
still
endlich
retained
the
drop
on
him
alf
neely
chuckled
fourth
of
july
dutch
he
said
sweetly
what
the
matter
do
you
think
it
fun
honest
to
gosh
you
just
ai
neighborly
then
he
switched
his
tone
it
became
a
soft
snarl
that
did
alter
his
insolent
and
confident
smirk
and
a
challenge
he
laughed
derisively
almost
softly
i
dare
you
to
try
to
shoot
straight
pal
he
said
even
you
got
more
sense
than
that
and
john
endlich
was
spang
against
his
terrible
blank
wall
again
seven
to
one
suppose
he
got
three
there
be
four
left
and
more
in
the
camp
but
the
four
would
survive
him
space
crazy
lugs
anyway
half
drunk
ready
to
hoot
at
the
stars
even
if
they
found
no
better
diversion
ready
to
push
even
any
of
their
own
bunch
around
who
seemed
weaker
than
they
for
spite
maybe
or
just
for
the
hell
of
it
as
a
reaction
against
the
awful
confinement
of
being
out
here
i
was
gon
na
smear
you
all
over
the
place
greenhorn
neely
rumbled
but
maybe
this
way
is
more
fun
hunh
maybe
we
be
back
tonight
but
do
wait
up
for
us
our
best
regards
to
your
sweet
family
john
endlich
blazing
and
just
rage
was
strangled
by
that
same
crawling
dread
as
before
as
he
saw
them
arc
upward
and
away
propelled
by
the
miniature
attached
to
the
belts
of
their
their
return
to
camp
hundreds
of
miles
distant
could
be
accomplished
in
a
couple
of
minutes
rose
and
the
kids
were
crouched
in
the
deflated
tent
but
returning
there
john
endlich
hardly
saw
them
he
hardly
heard
their
frightened
questions
to
the
trouble
with
neely
he
could
see
no
end
just
one
destructive
visitation
following
another
maybe
already
mortal
damage
had
been
done
but
endlich
could
lie
down
and
quit
any
more
than
a
snake
tossed
into
a
fire
could
stop
trying
to
crawl
out
of
it
as
long
as
life
lasted
whether
doing
so
made
sense
or
not
did
matter
in
endlich
was
the
savage
energy
of
despair
he
was
fighting
not
just
neely
and
his
crowd
but
that
other
enemy
which
was
perhaps
neely
main
trouble
too
yeah
the
stillness
the
nostalgia
the
harshness
no
do
want
any
breakfast
he
replied
sharply
to
rose
last
question
got
ta
work
he
was
like
an
rebuilding
a
trampled
nest
oblivious
to
the
certainty
of
its
being
trampled
again
first
he
scrambled
and
leaped
around
collecting
his
scattered
and
damaged
gear
he
found
that
his
main
atomic
battery
so
necessary
to
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
damaged
and
unworkable
and
he
had
no
hope
that
he
could
repair
it
but
this
did
stop
his
feverish
activity
now
he
started
unrolling
great
bolts
of
a
transparent
plastic
patching
with
an
adhesive
where
had
to
be
repaired
he
cut
strips
and
with
rose
help
laid
them
edge
to
edge
and
fastened
them
together
to
make
a
continuous
sheet
next
all
around
its
perimeter
he
dug
a
shallow
trench
the
edges
of
the
plastic
were
then
attached
to
massive
metal
rails
which
he
buried
in
the
trench
sealed
to
the
ground
along
all
the
sides
honey
he
growled
to
rose
next
we
fit
in
the
airlock
cabinet
at
one
corner
then
we
got
to
see
if
we
can
get
up
enough
air
to
inflate
the
whole
business
the
tough
part
the
way
things
are
by
then
the
sun
was
already
high
and
endlich
was
panting
raggedly
mostly
from
worry
after
the
massive
airlock
was
in
place
they
attached
their
electrolysis
apparatus
to
the
small
atomic
battery
which
had
been
used
to
run
the
the
well
was
in
the
area
covered
by
the
sheet
of
plastic
which
was
now
propped
up
here
and
there
with
long
pieces
of
board
from
the
great
box
over
their
heads
the
tough
clear
material
sagged
like
a
which
has
not
yet
been
run
up
all
the
way
on
its
poles
sluggishly
the
electrolysis
apparatus
broke
down
the
water
discharging
the
hydrogen
as
waste
through
a
pipe
out
over
the
airless
surface
of
vesta
but
freeing
the
oxygen
under
the
plastic
roof
yet
from
the
start
it
was
obvious
that
with
insufficient
electric
power
the
process
was
too
slow
and
we
need
to
use
to
thaw
the
ground
johnny
rose
said
and
to
keep
the
place
warm
and
to
bring
nitrogen
gas
up
out
of
the
soil
the
few
cylinders
of
the
compressed
stuff
that
we
got
wo
be
enough
to
make
a
start
and
the
carbon
dioxide
so
john
endlich
had
to
try
to
repair
that
main
battery
he
thought
after
a
while
that
he
might
succeed
in
time
but
then
rose
opened
the
airlock
and
the
kids
came
in
to
bother
him
with
all
the
triumph
of
a
favorite
puppy
dragging
an
bone
into
the
house
bubs
bore
a
crooked
piece
of
a
black
substance
hard
as
wood
and
more
gruesome
than
a
dried
and
moldy
a
tentacle
evelyn
shrilled
we
were
up
to
those
old
buildings
we
found
the
people
what
left
of
them
and
lots
of
stuff
we
saw
one
of
their
cars
and
there
was
lots
more
dad
you
got
ta
come
and
see
harassed
as
he
was
john
endlich
yielded
because
he
had
a
hunch
an
idea
of
a
possibility
so
he
went
with
his
children
he
passed
through
a
garden
where
a
pool
had
been
and
where
the
blackened
remains
of
plants
still
projected
from
beds
of
dried
soil
set
in
odd
he
passed
into
chambers
far
too
low
for
comfortable
human
habitation
and
what
did
he
know
of
the
uses
of
most
of
what
he
saw
there
the
niches
in
the
stone
walls
the
slanting
ramplike
object
of
blackened
wood
beside
which
three
weird
corpses
lay
the
glazed
plaque
on
the
wall
which
could
have
been
a
religious
emblem
a
calendar
of
some
kind
a
decoration
or
something
beyond
human
imagining
yeah
leave
such
stuff
for
cousin
ernest
the
school
teacher
if
he
ever
got
here
in
the
cylindrical
stone
shed
nearby
john
endlich
had
a
look
at
the
car
low
slung
a
tiller
no
seats
just
a
flat
platform
all
he
could
figure
out
about
the
motor
was
that
steam
seemed
the
link
between
atomic
energy
and
mechanical
motion
beyond
the
car
was
what
might
be
a
small
tractor
and
a
lot
of
odd
tools
but
the
thing
which
interested
him
most
was
the
pattern
of
copper
ribbons
insulated
with
a
heavy
glaze
similar
to
that
which
he
had
seen
traversing
walls
and
ceiling
in
the
first
building
he
had
entered
here
as
before
they
connected
with
queer
apparatus
which
might
be
stoves
and
motors
for
all
he
knew
and
also
with
the
globes
overhead
the
suggestiveness
of
all
this
was
plain
and
now
at
the
far
end
of
that
cylindrical
shed
john
endlich
found
the
square
case
where
all
of
those
copper
ribbons
came
together
it
was
sealed
and
apparently
nothing
could
have
damaged
it
very
much
in
the
frigid
stillness
of
millions
of
years
its
secrets
were
hidden
within
it
but
they
could
not
be
too
unfamiliar
and
its
presence
was
logical
a
small
compact
power
unit
nervously
he
turned
a
little
wheel
a
faint
vibration
was
transmitted
to
his
gloved
hand
and
the
globe
in
the
ceiling
began
to
glow
he
shut
the
thing
off
again
but
how
long
did
it
take
him
to
run
back
to
his
sagging
creation
of
clear
plastic
while
the
kids
howled
gleefully
around
him
and
return
with
the
end
of
a
long
cable
and
pliers
how
long
did
it
take
him
to
disconnect
all
of
the
glazed
copper
ribbons
and
substitute
the
wires
of
the
cable
attaching
them
to
queer
no
not
long
the
power
was
not
as
great
as
that
which
his
own
large
atomic
battery
would
have
supplied
but
it
proved
sufficient
and
the
current
was
direct
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
electrolysis
apparatus
bubbled
vigorously
slowly
the
tentlike
roof
began
to
rise
under
the
beginnings
of
a
tiny
that
does
it
pops
bubs
shrilled
yeah
maybe
so
john
endlich
agreed
almost
optimistically
he
felt
really
tender
toward
his
kids
just
then
they
really
helped
him
for
once
yes
almost
he
was
hopeful
until
he
glanced
at
the
rapidly
declining
sun
an
vigil
no
probably
worse
oh
lord
how
long
could
he
last
like
this
even
if
he
managed
to
keep
neely
and
company
at
bay
night
after
night
all
that
he
had
accomplished
seemed
useless
he
just
had
so
much
more
that
could
be
wrecked
pushed
over
with
a
harsh
laugh
as
if
it
really
was
something
funny
john
endlich
flesh
crawled
and
in
his
thinking
now
he
went
a
little
against
his
own
determinations
probably
because
in
the
present
state
of
his
disgust
he
needed
a
drink
bad
nuts
he
growled
lugubriously
if
i
only
been
a
little
more
sociable
that
was
where
the
trouble
started
i
might
have
got
broke
but
i
would
made
friends
they
think
i
snooty
rose
jaw
hardened
as
if
she
took
his
regrets
as
an
accusation
that
she
had
led
him
along
the
straight
and
narrow
path
which
by
an
exasperating
shift
in
philosophical
principle
now
seemed
the
shortest
route
to
destruction
but
he
felt
very
sorry
for
her
too
and
he
believe
that
what
he
had
just
said
was
entirely
the
truth
so
he
added
i
do
mean
it
honey
i
just
griping
she
softened
you
got
to
eat
johnny
she
said
you
have
eaten
all
day
and
tonight
you
got
to
sleep
i
keep
watch
maybe
be
all
right
well
anyway
it
was
nice
to
know
that
his
wife
was
like
that
yeah
gentle
and
fairminded
after
they
had
all
eaten
supper
he
tried
hard
to
keep
awake
fear
helped
him
to
do
so
more
than
ever
their
tent
was
now
covered
by
the
rising
plastic
roof
but
beyond
the
clear
substance
he
could
still
watch
for
starlight
to
be
stopped
by
prowling
forms
out
there
at
the
jagged
rim
of
vesta
it
was
hell
to
feel
your
skin
puckering
and
yet
to
have
exhaustion
pushing
your
eyelids
down
inexorably
somewhere
he
lost
the
hold
on
himself
and
he
dreamed
that
alf
neely
and
he
were
fighting
with
their
fists
and
he
was
being
beaten
to
a
pulp
but
he
was
wishing
desperately
that
he
could
win
then
they
could
have
a
drink
and
maybe
be
friends
but
he
knew
hopelessly
that
things
quite
that
simple
either
he
awoke
to
blink
at
blazing
sunshine
then
his
whole
body
became
clammy
with
perspiration
as
he
thought
of
his
lapse
from
responsibility
glancing
over
he
saw
that
rose
was
sleeping
as
soundly
as
the
kids
his
wide
eyes
searched
for
the
disaster
that
he
knew
he
find
but
the
wide
roof
was
all
the
way
up
now
intact
it
made
a
great
squarish
bubble
the
skin
of
which
was
specially
treated
to
stop
the
hard
and
dangerous
part
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
also
the
lethal
portion
of
the
cosmic
rays
it
even
had
an
layer
of
gum
that
could
seal
the
punctures
that
meteors
might
make
but
meteors
though
plentiful
in
the
asteroid
belt
were
curiously
innocuous
they
all
moved
in
much
the
same
direction
as
the
large
asteroids
and
at
much
the
same
velocity
so
their
relative
speed
had
to
be
low
the
walls
of
the
small
tent
around
endlich
sagged
where
they
had
bulged
tautly
before
showing
that
there
was
now
a
firm
and
equal
pressure
beyond
them
the
electrolysis
apparatus
had
been
left
active
all
night
and
the
heating
units
this
was
the
result
john
endlich
was
at
first
almost
unbelieving
when
he
saw
that
nothing
had
been
wrecked
during
the
night
for
a
moment
he
was
elated
he
woke
up
his
family
by
shouting
look
the
bums
stayed
away
they
come
look
we
got
five
acres
of
ground
covered
by
air
that
we
can
breathe
his
sense
of
triumph
however
was
soon
dampened
yes
he
been
left
unmolested
for
one
night
but
had
that
been
done
only
to
keep
him
at
a
fruitless
and
sleepless
watch
probably
another
delicate
form
of
hazing
and
it
meant
nothing
for
the
night
to
come
or
for
those
to
follow
so
he
was
in
the
same
harrowing
position
as
before
pursued
only
by
a
wild
and
defenseless
drive
to
get
things
done
to
find
some
slight
illusion
of
security
by
working
to
build
a
sham
of
normal
earthly
life
to
shut
out
the
cold
vacuum
and
a
little
of
the
bluntness
of
the
voidal
stars
to
make
certain
reassuring
sounds
possible
around
him
got
to
patch
up
the
pieces
of
the
house
first
and
bolt
together
rose
he
said
feverishly
kids
maybe
you
could
help
by
setting
out
some
of
the
hydroponic
troughs
for
planting
we
got
ta
break
plain
ground
too
as
soon
as
it
thawed
enough
we
got
ta
his
words
raced
on
with
his
flying
thoughts
it
was
a
mad
day
of
toil
the
hours
were
pitifully
short
they
be
stretched
to
cover
more
than
a
fraction
of
all
the
work
that
endlich
wanted
to
get
done
but
the
low
gravity
reduced
the
problem
of
heavy
lifting
to
almost
zero
at
least
and
he
did
get
the
house
assembled
so
that
rose
and
the
kids
and
he
could
sleep
inside
its
sealed
doors
sealed
that
is
if
neely
or
somebody
did
use
a
blaster
or
an
explosive
cap
or
bullet
in
an
orgy
of
perverted
humor
he
still
had
no
answer
for
that
rose
and
the
children
toiled
almost
as
hard
as
he
did
rose
even
managed
to
find
a
couple
of
dozen
eggs
that
by
being
carefully
packed
to
withstand
a
spaceship
takeoff
had
withstood
the
effects
of
idea
of
fun
she
set
up
an
incubator
and
put
them
inside
to
be
hatched
but
of
course
sunset
came
again
with
the
same
pendent
threat
as
before
terrible
and
a
vigil
was
all
but
impossible
john
endlich
was
out
on
his
feet
far
more
than
just
that
damned
neely
he
groaned
almost
too
weary
even
to
swallow
his
food
in
spite
of
the
luxury
of
a
real
supper
table
he
does
lose
sleep
he
can
pick
his
time
to
come
here
and
raise
hob
rose
glance
was
strange
almost
guilty
tonight
i
think
he
might
have
to
stay
home
too
she
said
john
endlich
blinked
at
her
all
right
she
answered
rather
defensively
so
to
speak
johnny
i
called
the
cops
yesterday
with
the
small
radio
transmitter
when
you
and
bubs
and
evelyn
were
up
in
those
old
buildings
i
reported
neely
and
his
companions
reported
them
sure
to
mahoney
the
boss
at
the
mining
camp
i
was
glad
to
find
out
that
there
is
a
little
law
and
order
around
here
mahoney
was
nice
he
said
that
he
would
be
surprised
if
they
were
cooled
in
the
can
for
a
few
days
and
then
confined
to
the
camp
area
matter
of
fact
i
radioed
him
again
last
night
it
been
done
john
endlich
vast
sigh
of
relief
was
slightly
tainted
by
the
idea
that
to
call
on
a
policing
power
for
protection
was
a
little
bit
on
the
timid
side
oh
he
grunted
thanks
i
never
thought
of
doing
that
johnny
yeah
i
kind
of
got
the
notion
though
from
between
the
lines
of
what
mahoney
said
that
there
was
heavy
trouble
brewing
at
the
camp
about
conditions
and
and
increased
maybe
danger
of
riots
and
johnny
anyhow
mahoney
said
that
we
should
on
exercising
all
reasonable
caution
mahoney
is
nice
ai
he
endlich
growled
you
stop
that
johnny
rose
ordered
but
her
husband
had
already
passed
beyond
thoughts
of
jealousy
he
was
thinking
of
the
time
when
neely
would
have
worked
out
his
sentence
and
would
be
free
to
roam
around
again
no
doubt
with
increased
annoyance
at
the
endlich
clan
for
causing
his
restraint
if
a
riot
or
something
did
spring
him
beforehand
john
endlich
itched
to
try
to
tear
his
head
off
but
of
course
the
same
consequences
as
before
still
applied
as
it
turned
out
the
endlichs
had
a
reprieve
of
two
months
and
fourteen
days
almost
to
the
hour
and
figured
on
a
strictly
scale
for
what
it
was
worth
they
accomplished
a
great
deal
in
their
great
plastic
greenhouse
supported
like
a
colossal
bubble
by
the
humid
air
inside
it
long
troughs
were
filled
with
pebbles
and
hydroponic
solution
and
therein
tomatoes
were
planted
and
lettuce
radishes
corn
onions
melons
just
about
everything
in
the
vegetable
line
there
remained
plenty
of
ground
left
over
from
the
five
acres
so
john
endlich
tinkered
with
that
tractor
figured
out
its
principle
and
used
it
to
help
harrow
up
the
ancient
soil
of
a
smashed
planet
he
added
commercial
fertilizers
and
nitrates
to
it
the
nitrates
were
of
course
distinct
from
the
gaseous
nitrogen
that
had
been
held
spongelike
by
the
subsoil
and
had
helped
supply
the
greenhouse
with
atmosphere
then
he
harrowed
the
ground
again
the
tractor
worked
fine
except
that
the
feeble
gravity
made
the
lugs
of
its
wheels
slip
a
lot
he
repeated
his
planting
in
the
manner
under
ideal
conditions
the
inside
of
the
great
bubble
was
soon
a
mass
of
growing
things
rose
had
planted
flowers
to
be
admired
and
to
help
out
the
hive
of
bees
which
were
essential
to
some
of
the
other
plants
as
well
nor
was
the
flora
limited
to
the
earthly
some
seeds
or
spores
had
survived
here
from
the
mother
world
of
the
asteroids
they
came
out
of
their
eons
of
suspended
animation
to
become
root
and
tough
spiky
stalk
and
to
mix
themselves
sparsely
with
vegetation
that
had
immigrated
from
earth
now
that
livable
conditions
had
been
restored
over
this
little
piece
of
ground
but
whether
they
were
fruit
or
weed
it
was
difficult
to
say
sometimes
john
endlich
was
misled
sometimes
listening
to
familiar
sounds
and
smelling
familiar
odors
toward
the
latter
part
of
his
reprieve
he
almost
imagined
that
he
accomplished
his
basic
desires
here
on
vesta
when
he
had
always
failed
on
earth
there
was
the
smell
of
warm
soil
flowers
greenery
he
heard
irrigation
water
trickling
the
sweetcorn
rustled
in
the
wind
of
fans
he
set
up
to
circulate
the
air
bees
buzzed
chickens
approaching
adolescence
peeped
contentedly
as
they
dusted
themselves
and
stretched
luxuriously
in
the
shadows
of
the
cornfield
for
john
endlich
it
was
all
like
the
echo
of
a
somnolent
summer
of
his
boyhood
there
was
peace
in
it
it
was
like
a
yearning
fulfilled
an
end
of
wanderlust
for
him
here
on
vesta
in
contrast
to
the
airless
desolation
outside
the
interior
of
this
greenhouse
was
the
one
most
desirable
place
to
be
so
except
for
the
vaguest
of
stirrings
sometimes
in
his
mind
there
was
not
much
incentive
to
seek
fun
elsewhere
if
he
ever
had
time
and
there
was
a
lot
of
the
legendary
too
in
what
his
family
and
he
had
accomplished
it
was
like
returning
a
little
of
the
blue
sky
and
the
sounds
of
life
to
this
land
of
ruins
and
roadways
and
the
ghosts
of
dead
beauty
maybe
there
be
a
lot
more
of
all
that
soon
when
the
rumored
major
influx
of
homesteaders
reached
vesta
yes
johnny
rose
said
once
is
a
lot
nicer
word
than
and
the
ghosts
are
changing
their
name
to
legends
rose
had
to
teach
the
kids
their
regular
lessons
that
children
would
be
taught
was
part
of
the
agreement
you
had
to
sign
at
the
before
you
could
be
shipped
out
with
them
but
the
kids
had
time
for
whimsy
too
in
they
took
their
excursions
far
back
to
former
ages
they
played
that
they
were
old
people
endlich
having
repaired
his
atomic
battery
did
draw
power
anymore
from
the
unit
that
had
supplied
the
ancient
buildings
but
the
relics
remained
from
a
device
like
a
phonograph
there
was
even
a
voice
that
chanted
when
a
lever
was
pressed
and
it
was
the
kids
who
found
the
first
bug
a
day
after
its
trills
were
heard
from
among
the
new
foliage
the
sound
was
like
that
of
a
little
wheel
humming
with
the
speed
of
rotation
and
then
slowing
to
a
scratchy
stop
a
hopper
with
a
thin
but
rigid
gliding
wing
of
horn
opalescent
in
its
colors
it
had
evidently
hatched
from
a
tiny
egg
preserved
by
the
cold
for
ages
wise
enough
not
to
clutch
it
with
his
bare
hands
bubs
came
running
with
it
held
in
a
leaf
it
proved
harmless
it
was
ugly
and
beautiful
its
great
charm
was
that
it
was
a
vocal
echo
from
the
far
past
sure
life
got
to
be
fairly
okay
in
spite
of
hard
work
the
endlichs
had
conquered
the
awful
stillness
with
growing
plants
kept
the
air
in
their
greenhouse
fresh
and
breathable
by
photosynthesis
john
endlich
did
a
lot
of
grinning
and
whistling
his
temper
never
flared
once
deep
down
in
him
there
was
only
a
brooding
certainty
that
the
calm
could
last
for
from
all
reports
trouble
seethed
at
the
mining
camp
at
any
time
there
might
be
a
blowup
a
reign
of
terror
that
would
roll
over
all
of
vesta
a
thing
to
release
forces
in
men
who
had
seen
too
many
hard
stars
and
had
heard
too
much
stillness
they
were
like
the
stuff
inside
a
complaining
volcano
the
endlichs
had
sought
to
time
their
various
crops
so
that
they
would
all
be
ready
for
market
on
as
nearly
as
possible
the
same
day
it
was
intended
as
a
trick
of
advertising
a
dramatically
sudden
appearance
of
much
fresh
produce
so
one
morning
in
a
endlich
arced
out
for
the
mining
camp
inside
the
suit
he
carried
samples
from
his
garden
six
tomatoes
beauties
have
luck
with
them
johnny
but
watch
out
rose
flung
after
him
by
helmet
phone
with
a
warm
laugh
just
for
a
moment
he
felt
maybe
a
little
silly
tomatoes
but
they
were
what
he
was
banking
on
and
had
forced
toward
maturity
most
the
way
he
figured
they
were
the
kind
of
fruit
that
the
guys
in
the
camp
gagged
by
a
diet
of
canned
and
dehydrated
stuff
because
they
were
too
busy
chasing
mineral
wealth
to
keep
a
decent
hydroponic
garden
going
would
be
hungriest
for
well
he
was
rather
too
right
in
some
ways
to
be
fortunate
yeah
they
still
call
what
happened
the
tomato
war
poor
johnny
endlich
he
was
headed
for
the
commissary
dome
to
display
his
wares
but
vague
urges
sidetracked
him
and
he
went
into
the
recreation
dome
of
the
camp
instead
and
into
the
bar
the
petty
sin
of
two
drinks
hardly
merits
the
punishing
trouble
which
came
his
way
as
at
least
partially
a
result
with
his
open
he
stood
at
the
bar
with
men
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
and
he
began
to
have
minor
delusions
of
grandeur
he
became
a
little
too
proud
of
his
accomplishments
his
wariness
slipped
into
abeyance
he
had
a
queer
idea
that
as
a
farmer
with
concrete
evidence
of
his
skills
to
show
he
would
win
respect
that
had
been
denied
him
dread
of
consequences
of
some
things
that
he
might
do
became
blurred
his
hot
temper
began
to
smolder
under
the
spark
of
memory
and
the
fury
of
insult
and
malicious
tricks
that
considering
the
safety
of
his
loved
ones
he
had
had
no
way
to
fight
back
against
frustration
is
a
dangerous
force
released
a
little
it
excited
him
more
and
the
tense
mood
of
the
camp
a
thing
in
the
very
air
of
the
domes
stirred
him
up
more
the
camp
ready
to
explode
into
sudden
open
barbarism
for
days
was
now
at
a
point
where
nothing
so
dramatic
as
fresh
tomatoes
and
farmers
in
a
bar
was
needed
to
set
the
fireworks
off
john
endlich
had
his
two
drinks
then
with
calm
and
foolhardy
detachment
he
set
the
six
tomatoes
out
in
a
row
before
him
on
the
synthetic
mahogany
he
did
have
to
wait
at
all
for
results
bloodshot
eyes
some
of
them
belonging
to
men
who
had
been
as
gentle
as
lambs
in
their
ordinary
lives
on
earth
turned
swiftly
alert
bristly
faces
showed
swift
changes
of
expression
surprise
interest
greed
for
possession
but
most
of
all
aggressive
and
satanic
humor
tamadas
somebody
growled
amazed
under
the
circumstances
to
be
aware
of
opportunity
was
to
act
big
paws
some
bare
and
calloused
some
in
the
gloves
of
space
suits
reached
out
grabbed
teeth
bit
juice
squirted
landing
on
hard
metal
shaped
for
the
interplanetary
regions
so
far
fine
john
endlich
felt
prouder
of
himself
he
expected
a
certain
fierceness
and
lack
of
manners
but
knowing
all
he
did
know
he
should
have
taken
time
to
visualize
the
inevitable
thanks
pal
you
a
prince
sure
but
the
thanks
were
more
of
a
mockery
than
a
formality
hey
none
for
me
whatsa
idea
shuddup
mic
who
dis
guy
say
friend
you
would
be
that
we
been
hearin
about
would
you
well
my
gracious
bet
you
are
dis
be
nice
to
watch
where
alf
neely
cranston
what
we
need
is
excitement
seen
him
out
by
the
the
bar
is
still
out
of
bounds
for
him
he
ca
come
in
here
says
who
boss
man
mahoney
for
dis
much
sport
neely
can
go
straight
to
hell
and
take
boss
man
with
him
on
a
pitchfork
the
big
man
whose
name
was
called
lumbered
to
the
window
at
the
entrance
to
the
bar
and
peered
inside
during
the
last
couple
of
months
been
in
a
perpetual
grouch
over
his
deprivation
of
liberty
which
had
rankled
him
more
as
an
affront
to
his
dignity
when
he
saw
the
husband
of
the
authoress
of
his
woes
the
little
bum
who
being
unable
to
guard
his
own
had
allowed
his
woman
to
holler
cop
neely
let
out
a
yell
of
sheer
glee
his
huge
shoulders
hunched
his
pendulous
nose
wobbled
his
squinty
eyes
gleamed
and
he
charged
into
the
bar
john
endlich
first
reaction
was
curiously
similar
to
neely
he
felt
a
flash
of
savage
triumph
under
the
stimulus
of
the
thought
of
immediate
battle
with
the
cause
of
most
of
his
troubles
temper
blazed
in
him
belatedly
however
the
awareness
came
into
his
mind
that
he
had
started
an
emotional
avalanche
that
went
far
beyond
the
weight
and
fury
of
one
man
like
neely
lord
would
he
ever
learn
it
was
tough
as
hell
to
crawl
but
how
could
a
man
put
his
wife
and
kids
in
awful
jeopardy
at
the
hands
of
a
flock
of
guys
whom
space
had
turned
into
gorillas
endlich
tried
for
peace
it
was
to
his
credit
that
he
did
so
quite
coolly
he
turned
toward
his
charging
adversary
and
grinned
hi
neely
he
said
have
a
drink
on
me
the
big
man
stopped
short
almost
in
unbelief
that
anyone
could
stoop
so
low
as
to
offer
appeasement
then
he
laughed
uproariously
why
i
be
delighted
he
said
in
a
tone
let
bygones
be
bygones
hey
charlie
hear
what
says
the
drinks
are
all
on
him
and
how
is
the
little
lady
lonesome
i
bet
glad
to
hear
it
i
gon
na
fix
that
with
a
sudden
lunge
neely
gripped
endlich
hand
and
gave
it
a
savage
if
momentary
twist
that
sent
needles
of
pain
shooting
up
the
homesteader
arm
it
was
a
goading
invitation
to
battle
which
grim
knowledge
of
the
sequel
now
compelled
endlich
to
pass
up
do
call
him
neely
somebody
yelled
it
ai
polite
to
mispronounce
a
name
it
mr
tomatoes
i
just
saw
bet
he
got
a
million
of
out
there
on
the
farm
the
whole
crowd
in
the
bar
broke
into
coarse
shouts
and
laughs
and
comments
we
ai
good
neighbors
neglecting
our
social
duties
let
pay
a
visit
what
else
you
got
besides
tamadas
let
go
on
a
picnic
hell
with
the
boss
man
we
need
some
diversion
i
not
goin
on
shift
come
on
everybody
there
gon
na
be
a
fight
a
moider
hell
with
the
boss
man
like
the
flicker
of
flame
flashing
through
dry
gunpowder
you
could
feel
the
excitement
spread
out
of
the
bar
out
of
the
it
would
soon
ignite
the
whole
tense
camp
john
endlich
heart
was
in
his
mouth
as
his
mind
pictured
the
part
of
all
this
that
would
affect
him
and
his
a
bunch
of
men
gone
wild
kicking
over
the
traces
arcing
around
vesta
sacking
and
destroying
in
sheer
exuberance
like
brats
on
they
would
stop
at
nothing
and
rose
and
the
kids
this
was
it
what
he
been
so
scared
of
all
along
it
was
at
least
partly
his
own
fault
and
there
was
no
way
to
stop
it
now
i
love
tomatoes
neely
rumbled
at
endlich
side
reaching
for
the
drink
that
had
been
set
before
him
but
first
gon
na
smear
you
all
over
the
camp
take
my
time
do
a
good
job
because
give
me
any
tomatoes
whereat
john
endlich
took
the
only
slender
advantage
at
hand
for
him
surprise
with
all
the
strength
of
his
muscular
body
backed
up
by
dread
and
fury
he
sent
a
gloved
fist
crashing
straight
into
neely
open
even
the
pang
in
his
knuckles
was
a
satisfaction
for
he
knew
that
the
damage
to
neely
ugly
features
must
be
many
times
greater
the
blow
occurring
under
the
conditions
of
vesta
tiny
gravity
had
an
entirely
effect
neely
eyes
glazing
floated
gently
up
and
away
and
endlich
since
he
had
at
the
last
instant
clutched
arm
was
drawn
along
with
the
miner
in
a
graceful
arcing
flight
through
the
smoky
air
of
the
bar
both
armored
bodies
lacking
nothing
in
inertia
tore
through
the
tough
plastic
window
and
they
bounced
lightly
on
the
pavement
of
the
main
section
of
the
neely
was
as
limp
as
a
wet
rag
sleeping
peacefully
blood
all
over
his
crushed
face
but
that
he
was
out
of
action
signified
no
peace
when
so
many
of
his
buddies
were
nearby
and
beginning
to
seethe
like
a
swarm
of
hornets
so
there
was
an
element
of
despair
in
endlich
quick
actions
as
he
slammed
neely
and
his
own
shut
picked
up
his
enemy
and
used
his
jets
to
propel
him
in
the
long
leap
to
the
airlock
of
the
dome
he
had
no
real
plan
he
just
had
the
ragged
and
all
but
hopeless
thought
of
using
neely
as
a
hostage
as
a
weapon
in
the
bitter
and
desperate
attempt
to
defend
his
wife
and
children
from
the
mob
that
would
be
following
close
behind
him
tumbling
end
over
end
with
his
light
but
bulky
burden
he
sprawled
at
the
threshold
of
the
airlock
where
the
guard
posted
there
had
stepped
hastily
out
of
his
way
again
capricious
luck
surprise
and
swift
action
were
on
his
side
he
pressed
the
of
the
lock
and
squirmed
through
its
double
valves
before
the
startled
guard
could
stop
him
then
he
slammed
his
jets
wide
and
aimed
for
the
horizon
it
was
a
wild
journey
for
to
fly
straight
in
a
frictionless
vacuum
any
missile
must
be
very
well
balanced
and
the
inertia
and
the
slight
but
unwieldy
weight
of
neely
bulk
disturbed
such
balance
in
his
own
space
suit
the
journey
was
made
then
not
in
a
smooth
arc
but
in
a
series
of
erratic
waverings
but
what
endlich
lacked
in
precise
direction
he
made
up
in
sheer
reckless
speed
from
the
very
start
of
that
wild
flight
he
heard
voices
in
his
helmet
phones
damn
greenhorn
did
you
see
how
he
hit
neely
schmidt
yeah
by
surprise
yeah
kuzak
i
saw
he
hit
without
warning
damn
yella
yokel
who
comin
along
to
get
him
sure
there
was
another
side
to
it
other
voices
shucks
neely
had
it
coming
to
him
i
hope
the
farmer
really
murders
that
big
lunkhead
you
ai
kiddin
muir
i
was
glad
to
see
his
face
splatter
like
a
rotten
tamata
okay
fine
it
was
good
to
know
you
had
some
sensible
guys
on
your
side
but
what
good
was
it
when
the
camp
as
a
whole
was
boiling
over
from
its
internal
troubles
there
were
more
than
enough
roughnecks
to
do
a
mighty
messy
job
fast
panting
with
tension
endlich
swooped
down
before
his
greenhouse
and
dragged
neely
inside
through
the
airlock
for
a
fleeting
instant
the
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
that
impinged
on
his
senses
as
he
opened
his
once
more
brought
him
a
regret
the
rustle
of
corn
the
odor
of
greenery
the
chicken
voices
there
was
home
in
all
of
this
something
pastoral
and
beautiful
and
orderly
gained
with
hard
work
and
something
brought
back
restored
from
the
remote
past
the
buzzing
of
the
bug
was
even
a
real
echo
from
that
smashed
yet
undoubtedly
once
beautiful
world
of
antiquity
but
these
were
fragile
concerns
beside
the
desperate
question
of
the
immediate
safety
of
rose
and
the
kids
already
cries
and
shouts
and
comments
were
coming
faintly
through
his
helmet
phones
again
get
the
yokel
get
the
bum
we
fix
his
wagon
good
the
pack
was
on
the
way
getting
closer
with
every
heartbeat
never
in
his
life
had
endlich
experienced
so
harrowing
a
time
as
this
never
if
by
some
miracle
he
lived
could
he
expect
another
equal
to
it
to
stand
and
fight
as
he
would
have
done
if
he
were
alone
would
mean
simply
that
he
would
be
cut
down
to
try
the
peacemaking
of
appeasement
would
have
probably
the
same
result
plus
for
himself
the
dishonor
of
contempt
so
where
was
there
to
turn
with
grim
unanswering
blankness
on
every
side
john
endlich
felt
mightily
an
old
yearning
that
of
a
fundamentally
peaceful
man
for
a
way
to
oppose
and
win
against
brutal
overpowering
odds
without
using
either
serious
violence
or
the
even
more
futile
course
of
supine
submission
here
on
vesta
this
had
been
the
issue
he
had
faced
all
along
in
many
ages
and
many
nations
and
probably
on
many
planets
throughout
the
universe
others
had
faced
it
before
him
to
his
straining
and
tortured
mind
the
trite
and
somewhat
mocking
answers
came
psychology
salesmanship
the
selling
of
respect
for
self
ah
yes
these
were
fine
words
glib
words
but
the
question
how
was
more
bitter
and
derisive
than
ever
still
he
had
to
try
something
to
make
at
least
a
forlorn
effort
and
now
from
certain
beliefs
that
he
had
coupled
with
some
vague
observations
that
he
had
made
during
the
last
hour
a
tattered
suggestion
of
what
form
that
effort
might
take
came
to
him
as
for
his
personal
defects
that
had
given
him
trouble
in
the
past
well
he
was
lugubriously
sure
that
he
had
learned
a
final
lesson
about
liquor
for
him
it
always
meant
trouble
as
for
wanderlust
and
the
gambling
and
urge
he
had
been
willing
to
stay
put
on
vesta
named
for
the
goddess
of
home
for
weeks
now
and
he
was
now
about
to
make
his
last
great
gamble
if
he
lost
he
would
be
alive
to
gamble
again
if
by
great
he
won
well
he
was
certain
that
all
the
charm
of
unnecessary
would
by
the
memory
of
these
awful
moments
be
forever
poisoned
in
him
now
rose
and
the
youngsters
came
hurrying
toward
him
back
so
soon
johnny
rose
called
what
this
what
happened
who
the
guy
pop
evelyn
asked
oh
baloney
nose
what
are
you
doing
with
him
but
by
then
they
all
had
guessed
some
of
the
tense
mood
and
its
probable
meaning
neely
pals
are
coming
honey
endlich
said
quietly
it
the
showdown
hide
the
kids
and
yourself
quick
under
the
house
maybe
rose
pale
eyes
met
his
they
were
comprehending
they
were
worried
but
they
were
cool
he
could
see
that
she
did
want
to
leave
him
evelyn
looked
as
though
she
might
begin
to
whimper
but
her
small
jaw
hardened
bubs
lower
lip
trembled
but
he
said
valiantly
i
get
the
guns
pop
i
stayin
with
yuh
no
you
not
son
john
endlich
answered
get
going
orders
get
the
guns
to
keep
with
you
to
watch
out
for
mom
and
sis
rose
took
the
kids
away
with
her
without
a
word
endlich
wondered
how
to
describe
what
was
maybe
her
last
look
at
him
there
were
no
fancy
words
in
his
mind
just
love
and
deep
concern
alf
neely
was
showing
signs
of
returning
consciousness
which
was
good
still
dragging
him
endlich
went
and
got
a
bushel
basket
it
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
ripe
red
tomatoes
but
he
could
carry
its
tiny
weight
on
the
palm
of
one
hand
scarcely
noticing
that
it
was
there
for
an
instant
endlich
scanned
the
sky
through
the
clear
plastic
roof
of
the
great
bubble
he
saw
at
least
a
score
of
shapes
in
space
armor
arcing
nearer
specks
in
human
form
glowing
with
reflected
sunlight
like
little
hurtling
moons
among
the
stars
neely
pals
in
a
moment
they
would
arrive
endlich
took
neely
and
the
loaded
basket
close
to
the
transparent
side
of
the
greenhouse
nearest
the
approaching
roughnecks
there
he
removed
neely
oxygen
helmet
hoping
that
maybe
this
might
deter
his
friends
a
little
from
rupturing
the
plastic
of
the
huge
bubble
and
letting
the
air
out
it
was
a
feeble
safeguard
for
in
all
probability
in
case
of
such
rupture
neely
would
be
rescued
from
death
by
smothering
and
cold
and
the
boiling
of
his
blood
simply
by
having
his
helmet
slammed
back
on
again
next
endlich
dumped
the
contents
of
the
basket
on
the
ground
inverted
it
and
sat
neely
upon
it
the
big
man
had
recovered
consciousness
enough
to
be
merely
groggy
by
now
endlich
slapped
his
battered
face
vigorously
to
help
clear
his
head
after
having
of
course
relieved
him
of
the
blaster
at
his
belt
endlich
left
his
own
open
so
that
the
sounds
of
voice
could
penetrate
to
the
mike
of
his
own
helmet
phone
thus
to
be
transmitted
to
the
helmet
phones
of
neely
buddies
endlich
was
anything
but
calm
inside
with
the
wild
horde
as
irresponsible
in
their
present
state
of
mind
as
a
pack
of
idiot
baboons
bearing
down
on
him
but
he
forced
his
tone
to
be
conversational
when
he
spoke
hello
neely
he
said
you
mentioned
you
liked
tomatoes
maybe
you
were
kidding
anyhow
i
brought
you
along
home
with
me
so
you
could
have
some
here
on
the
ground
right
in
front
of
you
is
a
whole
bushel
the
regular
asteroids
price
considering
the
trouble
it
takes
to
grow
and
the
amount
of
dough
a
guy
like
you
can
make
for
himself
out
here
is
five
bucks
apiece
but
for
you
right
now
they
all
free
here
have
a
nice
fresh
ripe
one
neely
the
big
man
glared
at
his
captor
for
a
second
after
he
had
looked
dazedly
around
he
would
have
leaped
to
his
feet
except
that
the
muzzle
of
his
own
blaster
was
leveled
at
the
center
of
his
chest
at
a
range
of
not
over
twenty
inches
for
a
fleeting
instant
neely
looked
scared
and
prudent
then
he
saw
his
pals
landing
like
a
flock
of
birds
just
beyond
the
transparent
side
of
the
greenhouse
and
he
heard
their
shouts
coming
loudly
from
endlich
we
come
after
you
neely
we
get
the
damn
yokel
off
your
neck
come
on
guys
let
turn
the
damn
place
upside
down
neely
grew
courageous
yes
maybe
it
did
take
a
certain
animal
nerve
to
do
what
he
did
his
battered
and
bloodied
lip
curled
whatdayuh
think
you
up
to
he
snarled
slowly
his
tone
dripping
contempt
for
the
insanely
foolish
he
laughed
sourly
then
his
face
twisted
into
a
confident
and
mocking
leer
to
carry
the
mockery
farther
a
big
paw
reached
out
and
grabbed
the
proffered
tomato
from
endlich
hand
sure
thanks
anything
to
oblige
he
took
a
great
bite
from
the
fruit
clowning
the
action
with
a
forced
expression
of
relish
ummm
he
grunted
in
danger
he
was
being
the
showman
playing
for
the
approval
of
his
pals
he
was
proving
his
comic
coolness
that
even
now
he
was
master
of
the
situation
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
be
rescued
come
on
punk
he
ordered
endlich
where
is
the
next
one
seeing
you
so
generous
be
polite
to
your
guest
endlich
handed
him
a
second
tomato
but
as
he
did
so
it
seemed
all
the
things
he
dreaded
would
happen
were
breathing
down
his
back
for
the
faces
that
he
glimpsed
beyond
the
plastic
showed
the
twisted
expressions
that
betray
the
point
where
savage
humor
imperceptibly
becomes
murderous
a
dozen
blasters
were
leveled
at
him
but
the
eyes
of
the
men
outside
showed
too
the
kind
of
interest
that
any
odd
procedure
can
command
they
stood
still
for
a
moment
watching
commenting
hey
neely
see
if
you
can
down
the
next
one
with
one
bite
eat
all
neely
save
some
for
us
endlich
was
following
no
complete
plan
he
had
only
the
feeling
that
somewhere
here
there
might
be
a
dramatic
touch
that
by
a
long
chance
would
yield
him
a
toehold
on
the
situation
without
a
word
he
gave
neely
a
third
tomato
then
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
neely
kept
gobbling
and
clowning
yeah
but
can
this
sort
of
horseplay
go
on
until
one
man
has
consumed
an
entire
bushel
of
tomatoes
the
question
began
to
shine
speculatively
in
the
faces
of
the
onlookers
it
began
to
appeal
to
their
wolfish
sense
of
comedy
and
it
started
to
betray
itself
in
another
manner
in
face
after
the
fifteenth
tomato
he
burped
and
balked
that
enough
around
he
growled
get
away
with
your
damned
garden
truck
i
should
be
beatin
you
to
a
right
this
minute
why
i
then
neely
tried
to
lunge
for
the
blaster
as
endlich
squeezed
the
trigger
he
turned
the
weapon
aside
a
trifle
so
that
the
beam
of
energy
flicked
past
neely
ear
and
splashed
garden
soil
that
turned
incandescent
instantly
john
endlich
might
have
died
in
that
moment
cut
down
from
behind
that
he
was
probably
meant
that
from
the
position
of
complete
underdog
among
the
spectators
his
popularity
had
risen
some
neely
he
said
with
a
grin
how
can
you
start
beatin
when
you
done
eatin
neely
here
i
am
trying
to
be
friendly
and
hospitable
and
you
are
a
whole
bushel
of
juicy
tomatoes
symbols
of
civilization
way
the
hell
out
here
in
the
asteroids
and
you
even
made
a
dent
in
yet
what
the
matter
neely
lose
your
appetite
here
eat
endlich
tone
was
falsely
persuasive
for
there
was
a
steely
note
of
command
in
it
and
the
blaster
in
endlich
hand
was
pointed
straight
at
neely
chest
neely
eyes
began
to
look
frightened
and
sullen
he
shifted
uncomfortably
and
the
bushel
basket
creaked
under
his
weight
yella
as
any
damn
he
said
loudly
you
do
fight
fair
guys
what
the
matter
with
you
get
this
nut
with
the
blaster
offa
me
hmm
yella
endlich
seemed
to
muse
maybe
not
as
yella
as
you
were
once
coming
around
here
at
night
with
a
whole
gang
not
so
long
ago
call
yella
nelly
hollered
why
you
lousy
damn
yokel
if
you
did
have
that
blaster
endlich
said
grimly
but
i
got
it
friend
he
sent
a
stream
of
energy
from
the
blaster
right
past
neely
head
so
close
that
a
shock
of
the
other
hair
smoked
and
curled
into
black
wisps
and
watch
your
language
my
wife
and
kids
can
hear
you
neely
thick
shoulders
hunched
he
ducked
nervously
rubbing
his
head
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
hint
of
genuine
alarm
in
his
voice
all
right
he
growled
all
right
take
it
easy
something
deep
within
john
endlich
relaxed
a
cold
tight
knot
seemed
to
unwind
for
at
that
moment
he
knew
that
neely
was
beginning
to
lose
the
big
man
evident
discomfort
and
fear
were
the
marks
of
weakness
to
his
followers
at
least
and
with
them
he
could
never
be
a
leader
again
moreover
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
maneuvered
into
the
position
of
being
the
butt
of
a
practical
joke
that
by
his
own
code
must
be
followed
up
to
its
nasty
if
interesting
outcome
the
spectators
began
to
resemble
romans
at
the
circus
with
neely
the
victim
and
the
victim
downfall
was
tragically
swift
come
on
neely
you
heard
what
said
somebody
yelled
jeez
a
whole
bushel
let
see
how
many
you
can
eat
neely
damned
if
this
ai
gon
na
be
rich
do
let
us
down
neely
nobody
yuh
all
you
have
to
do
is
eat
all
them
nice
tamadas
hey
neely
if
that
bushel
ai
enough
for
you
i
personally
buy
you
another
at
the
price
lucky
neely
look
at
him
having
a
swell
banquet
better
than
if
he
was
home
come
on
make
him
eat
yeah
under
certain
conditions
human
nature
can
be
pretty
fickle
wonderingly
john
endlich
felt
himself
to
be
respected
the
top
man
the
guy
who
had
shown
courage
and
ingenuity
and
was
winning
by
the
harsh
code
of
men
who
had
been
roughened
and
soured
by
space
by
life
among
the
asteroids
for
a
little
while
then
he
had
to
be
hard
he
thrust
another
tomato
toward
neely
at
the
same
time
directing
a
thin
stream
from
the
blaster
just
past
the
big
nose
neely
ate
six
more
tomatoes
with
a
will
his
eyes
popping
sweat
streaming
down
his
forehead
endlich
next
barely
missed
neely
booted
toe
the
persuasive
shot
was
worth
more
dollars
in
garden
fruit
consumed
the
crowd
gave
with
mock
cheers
and
bravos
and
demanded
more
action
that
makes
come
on
neely
that
just
a
good
start
you
got
a
long
long
ways
to
go
come
on
bet
you
can
stuff
fifty
into
him
to
goad
neely
on
in
this
ludicrous
and
savage
game
endlich
next
just
scorched
the
metal
at
neely
shoulder
it
is
to
be
said
that
endlich
did
enjoy
his
revenge
for
all
the
anguish
and
real
danger
that
neely
had
caused
him
but
as
this
fierce
yet
childish
sport
went
on
and
the
going
turned
really
rough
for
the
big
asteroid
miner
endlich
anger
began
to
be
mixed
with
he
always
be
a
guy
he
could
help
that
but
now
satisfaction
and
a
hopeful
glimpse
of
peace
ahead
burned
the
fury
out
of
him
and
touched
him
with
shame
still
for
a
little
more
he
had
to
go
on
again
and
again
as
before
he
used
that
blaster
but
as
he
did
so
he
talked
ramblingly
knowing
that
the
audience
too
would
hear
what
he
said
maybe
in
a
way
it
was
a
lecture
but
he
could
help
that
have
another
tomato
neely
sorry
to
do
things
like
this
but
it
your
own
way
so
why
should
you
complain
funny
ai
it
a
man
can
get
even
too
many
tomatoes
civilized
tomatoes
part
of
something
most
guys
around
here
have
been
homesick
for
for
a
long
time
maybe
what
has
been
most
of
the
trouble
out
here
in
the
asteroids
not
enough
civilization
on
earth
we
were
used
to
certain
standards
in
spite
of
being
rough
enough
there
too
here
the
traces
got
kicked
over
but
on
this
side
of
vesta
an
idea
begins
to
soak
in
this
used
to
be
nice
country
blue
sky
trees
growing
some
of
that
is
coming
back
neely
and
order
with
it
because
deep
in
our
guts
that
what
we
all
want
and
fresh
vegetables
help
have
another
tomato
neely
or
should
we
call
it
enough
guys
illustration
voice
was
steely
sorry
to
do
things
like
this
but
it
your
way
neely
you
ai
gon
na
quit
now
somebody
guffawed
you
almost
good
neely
face
was
purple
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
mouth
hung
partly
open
gawd
no
please
he
croaked
an
embarrassed
hush
fell
over
the
crowd
back
home
on
earth
they
had
all
been
average
men
finally
someone
said
expressing
the
intrusion
among
them
of
the
better
dignity
of
man
aw
let
the
poor
dope
go
then
and
there
john
endlich
sold
what
was
left
of
his
first
bushel
of
tomatoes
one
of
his
customers
the
once
schmidt
even
said
rather
stiffly
you
all
right
and
these
guys
were
the
real
roughnecks
of
the
mining
camp
is
it
necessary
to
mention
that
as
they
were
leaving
neely
lost
his
pride
completely
soiling
the
inside
of
his
helmet
so
that
he
could
scarcely
see
out
of
it
that
amid
the
raucous
laughter
of
his
companions
which
still
sounded
slightly
and
pitying
thus
alf
neely
sank
at
last
to
the
level
of
helpless
oblivion
and
nonentity
a
week
of
vestal
days
later
in
the
afternoon
rose
and
the
kids
came
to
john
endlich
who
was
toiling
over
his
cucumbers
their
name
is
harper
pop
bubs
shouted
and
they
got
three
children
evelyn
added
john
endlich
straightened
shaking
a
kink
out
of
his
tired
back
who
he
questioned
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
our
new
neighbors
johnny
rose
said
happily
we
just
picked
up
the
news
on
the
radio
from
their
ship
which
is
approaching
from
space
right
now
i
hope
they
nice
folks
and
johnny
there
used
to
be
country
schools
with
no
more
than
five
pupils
sure
john
endlich
said
something
felt
warm
around
his
heart
leave
it
to
a
woman
to
think
of
a
school
the
symbol
of
civilization
marching
now
across
the
void
john
endlich
thought
of
the
trouble
at
the
mining
camp
which
his
first
load
of
fresh
vegetables
picked
up
by
a
small
space
boat
had
perhaps
helped
to
end
he
thought
of
the
relics
in
this
strange
land
things
that
were
like
legends
of
a
lost
pastoral
beauty
things
that
could
come
back
the
second
family
of
homesteaders
was
almost
here
endlich
was
reconciled
to
domesticity
he
felt
at
home
he
felt
proud
bees
buzzed
near
him
a
bug
from
a
perished
era
hummed
and
scraped
out
a
mournful
sound
i
wonder
if
the
harper
kids
call
you
pop
bubs
remarked
like
the
miners
still
do
john
endlich
laughed
but
somehow
he
was
prouder
than
ever
maybe
the
name
would
be
a
legend
too
