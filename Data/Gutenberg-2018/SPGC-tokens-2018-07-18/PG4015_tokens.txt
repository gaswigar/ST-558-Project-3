scene
i
scene
firemen
forecastle
of
a
transatlantic
liner
an
hour
after
sailing
from
new
york
for
the
voyage
across
tiers
of
narrow
steel
bunks
three
deep
on
all
sides
an
entrance
in
rear
benches
on
the
floor
before
the
bunks
the
room
is
crowded
with
men
shouting
cursing
laughing
singing
a
confused
inchoate
uproar
swelling
into
a
sort
of
unity
a
meaning
the
bewildered
furious
baffled
defiance
of
a
beast
in
a
cage
nearly
all
the
men
are
drunk
many
bottles
are
passed
from
hand
to
hand
all
are
dressed
in
dungaree
pants
heavy
ugly
shoes
some
wear
singlets
but
the
majority
are
stripped
to
the
treatment
of
this
scene
or
of
any
other
scene
in
the
play
should
by
no
means
be
naturalistic
the
effect
sought
after
is
a
cramped
space
in
the
bowels
of
a
ship
imprisoned
by
white
steel
the
lines
of
bunks
the
uprights
supporting
them
cross
each
other
like
the
steel
framework
of
a
cage
the
ceiling
crushes
down
upon
the
men
heads
they
can
not
stand
upright
this
accentuates
the
natural
stooping
posture
which
shovelling
coal
and
the
resultant
of
back
and
shoulder
muscles
have
given
them
the
men
themselves
should
resemble
those
pictures
in
which
the
appearance
of
neanderthal
man
is
guessed
at
all
are
with
long
arms
of
tremendous
power
and
low
receding
brows
above
their
small
fierce
resentful
eyes
all
the
civilized
white
races
are
represented
but
except
for
the
slight
differentiation
in
color
of
hair
skin
eyes
all
these
men
are
curtain
rises
on
a
tumult
of
sound
yank
is
seated
in
the
foreground
he
seems
broader
fiercer
more
truculent
more
powerful
more
sure
of
himself
than
the
rest
they
respect
his
superior
strength
the
grudging
respect
of
fear
then
too
he
represents
to
them
a
the
very
last
word
in
what
they
are
their
most
highly
developed

loud

out
in
a
voice
full
of
old
we
belong
to

saying
we
make

ship
to

saying

that
almighty

voice
runs
into
the
wail
of
a
keen
he
rocks
back
and
forth
on
his
bench
the
men
stare
at
him
startled
and
impressed
in
spite
of
oh
to
be
back
in
the
fine
days
of
my
youth
ochone
oh
there
was
fine
beautiful
ships
them
days
clippers
wid
tall
masts
touching
the
sky
fine
strong
men
in
them
men
that
was
sons
of
the
sea
as
if
was
the
mother
that
bore
them
oh
the
clean
skins
of
them
and
the
clear
eyes
the
straight
backs
and
full
chests
of
them
brave
men
they
was
and
bold
men
surely
we
be
sailing
out
bound
down
round
the
horn
maybe
we
be
making
sail
in
the
dawn
with
a
fair
breeze
singing
a
chanty
song
wid
no
care
to
it
and
astern
the
land
would
be
sinking
low
and
dying
out
but
give
it
no
heed
but
a
laugh
and
never
a
look
behind
for
the
day
that
was
was
enough
for
we
was
free
men
and
i
thinking
is
only
slaves
do
be
giving
heed
to
the
day
that
gone
or
the
day
to
come
until
they
old
like
me
a
sort
of
religious
oh
to
be
scudding
south
again
wid
the
power
of
the
trade
wind
driving
her
on
steady
through
the
nights
and
the
days
full
sail
on
her
nights
and
days
nights
when
the
foam
of
the
wake
would
be
flaming
wid
fire
when
the
sky
be
blazing
and
winking
wid
stars
or
the
full
of
the
moon
maybe
then
you
see
her
driving
through
the
gray
night
her
sails
stretching
aloft
all
silver
and
white
not
a
sound
on
the
deck
the
lot
of
us
dreaming
dreams
till
you
believe
was
no
real
ship
at
all
you
was
on
but
a
ghost
ship
like
the
flying
dutchman
they
say
does
be
roaming
the
seas
forevermore
widout
touching
a
port
and
there
was
the
days
too
a
warm
sun
on
the
clean
decks
sun
warming
the
blood
of
you
and
wind
over
the
miles
of
shiny
green
ocean
like
strong
drink
to
your
lungs
work
aye
hard
work
but
who
mind
that
at
all
sure
you
worked
under
the
sky
and
was
work
wid
skill
and
daring
to
it
and
wid
the
day
done
in
the
dog
watch
smoking
me
pipe
at
ease
the
lookout
would
be
raising
land
maybe
and
we
see
the
mountains
of
south
americy
wid
the
red
fire
of
the
setting
sun
painting
their
white
tops
and
the
clouds
floating
by
them
tone
of
exaltation
ceases
he
goes
on
yerra
what
the
use
of
talking
is
a
dead
man
whisper
yank

scene
ii
scene
two
days
out
a
section
of
the
promenade
deck
mildred
douglas
and
her
aunt
are
discovered
reclining
in
deck
chairs
the
former
is
a
girl
of
twenty
slender
delicate
with
a
pale
pretty
face
marred
by
a
expression
of
disdainful
superiority
she
looks
fretful
nervous
and
discontented
bored
by
her
own
anemia
her
aunt
is
a
pompous
and
proud
and
fat
old
lady
she
is
a
type
even
to
the
point
of
a
double
chin
and
lorgnettes
she
is
dressed
pretentiously
as
if
afraid
her
face
alone
would
never
indicate
her
position
in
life
mildred
is
dressed
all
in
white
the
impression
to
be
conveyed
by
this
scene
is
one
of
the
beautiful
vivid
life
of
the
sea
all
about
sunshine
on
the
deck
in
a
great
flood
the
fresh
sea
wind
blowing
across
it
in
the
midst
of
this
these
two
incongruous
artificial
figures
inert
and
disharmonious
the
elder
like
a
gray
lump
of
dough
touched
up
with
rouge
the
younger
looking
as
if
the
vitality
of
her
stock
had
been
sapped
before
she
was
conceived
so
that
she
is
the
expression
not
of
its
life
energy
but
merely
of
the
artificialities
that
energy
had
won
for
itself
in
the
spending
mildred
up
with
affected
how
the
black
smoke
swirls
back
against
the
sky
is
it
not
beautiful
aunt
looking
i
dislike
smoke
of
any
kind
mildred
my
smoked
a
pipe
a
clay
pipe
aunt
vulgar
mildred
she
was
too
distant
a
relative
to
be
vulgar
time
mellows
pipes
aunt
boredom
but
did
the
sociology
you
took
up
at
college
teach
you
that
to
play
the
ghoul
on
every
possible
occasion
excavating
old
bones
why
not
let
your
rest
in
her
grave
mildred
with
her
pipe
beside
her
puffing
in
paradise
aunt
yes
you
are
a
natural
born
ghoul
you
are
even
getting
to
look
like
one
my
dear
mildred
a
passionless
i
detest
you
aunt
at
her
do
you
know
what
you
remind
me
of
of
a
cold
pork
pudding
against
a
background
of
linoleum
tablecloth
in
the
kitchen
of
a
but
the
possibilities
are
wearisome
closes
her
aunt
a
bitter
merci
for
your
candor
but
since
i
am
and
must
be
your
chaperone
in
appearance
at
least
let
us
patch
up
some
sort
of
armed
truce
for
my
part
you
are
quite
free
to
indulge
any
pose
of
eccentricity
that
beguiles
you
as
long
as
you
observe
the
amenities
mildred
the
inanities
aunt
on
as
if
she
had
after
exhausting
the
morbid
thrills
of
social
service
work
on
new
york
east
side
how
they
must
have
hated
you
by
the
way
the
poor
that
you
made
so
much
poorer
in
their
own
eyes
you
are
now
bent
on
making
your
slumming
international
well
i
hope
whitechapel
will
provide
the
needed
nerve
tonic
do
not
ask
me
to
chaperone
you
there
however
i
told
your
father
i
would
not
i
loathe
deformity
we
will
hire
an
army
of
detectives
and
you
may
investigate
everything
they
allow
you
to
see
mildred
with
a
trace
of
genuine
please
do
not
mock
at
my
attempts
to
discover
how
the
other
half
lives
give
me
credit
for
some
sort
of
groping
sincerity
in
that
at
least
i
would
like
to
help
them
i
would
like
to
be
some
use
in
the
world
is
it
my
fault
i
do
know
how
i
would
like
to
be
sincere
to
touch
life
somewhere
weary
but
i
afraid
i
have
neither
the
vitality
nor
integrity
all
that
was
burnt
out
in
our
stock
before
i
was
born
grandfather
blast
furnaces
flaming
to
the
sky
melting
steel
making
millions
then
father
keeping
those
home
fires
burning
making
more
millions
and
little
me
at
the
of
it
all
i
a
waste
product
in
the
bessemer
process
like
the
millions
or
rather
i
inherit
the
acquired
trait
of
the
wealth
but
none
of
the
energy
none
of
the
strength
of
the
steel
that
made
it
i
am
sired
by
gold
and
darned
by
it
as
they
say
at
the
race
track
damned
in
more
ways
than
one
laughs
aunt
you
seem
to
be
going
in
for
sincerity
it
is
becoming
to
you
really
except
as
an
obvious
pose
be
as
artificial
as
you
are
i
advise
there
a
sort
of
sincerity
in
that
you
know
and
after
all
you
must
confess
you
like
that
better
mildred
affected
and
yes
i
suppose
i
do
pardon
me
for
my
outburst
when
a
leopard
complains
of
its
spots
it
must
sound
rather
grotesque
a
mocking
purr
little
leopard
purr
scratch
tear
kill
gorge
yourself
and
be
happy
only
stay
in
the
jungle
where
your
spots
are
camouflage
in
a
cage
they
make
you
conspicuous
aunt
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
mildred
it
would
be
rude
to
talk
about
anything
to
you
let
just
talk
looks
at
her
wrist
well
thank
goodness
about
time
for
them
to
come
for
me
that
ought
to
give
me
a
new
thrill
aunt
aunt
you
do
mean
to
say
you
really
going
the
dirt
the
heat
must
be
frightful
mildred
grandfather
started
as
a
puddler
i
should
have
inherited
an
immunity
to
heat
that
would
make
a
salamander
shiver
it
will
be
fun
to
put
it
to
the
test
aunt
but
do
you
have
to
have
the
captain
or
someone
permission
to
visit
the
stokehole
mildred
a
triumphant
i
have
it
both
his
and
the
chief
engineer
oh
they
did
want
to
at
first
in
spite
of
my
social
service
credentials
they
did
seem
a
bit
anxious
that
i
should
investigate
how
the
other
half
lives
and
works
on
a
ship
so
i
had
to
tell
them
that
my
father
the
president
of
nazareth
steel
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
this
line
had
told
me
it
would
be
all
right
aunt
he
did
mildred
how
naive
age
makes
one
but
i
said
he
did
aunt
i
even
said
he
had
given
me
a
letter
to
them
which
i
had
lost
and
they
were
afraid
to
take
the
chance
that
i
might
be
lying
so
ho
for
the
stokehole
the
second
engineer
is
to
escort
me
at
her
watch
it
time
and
here
he
comes
i
think
second
engineer
enters
he
is
a
husky
man
of
or
so
he
stops
before
the
two
and
tips
his
cap
visibly
embarrassed
and
second
engineer
miss
douglas
mildred
yes
off
her
rugs
and
getting
to
her
are
we
all
ready
to
start
second
engineer
in
just
a
second
i
waiting
for
the
fourth
he
coming
along
mildred
a
scornful
you
do
care
to
shoulder
this
responsibility
alone
is
that
it
second
engineer
a
two
are
better
than
one
by
her
eyes
glances
out
to
sea
blurts
a
fine
day
we
having
mildred
is
it
second
engineer
a
nice
warm
breeze
mildred
it
feels
cold
to
me
second
engineer
but
it
hot
enough
in
the
sun
mildred
not
hot
enough
for
me
i
do
like
nature
i
was
never
athletic
second
engineer
a
well
you
find
it
hot
enough
where
you
going
mildred
do
you
mean
hell
second
engineer
decides
to
no
i
mean
the
stokehole
mildred
my
grandfather
was
a
puddler
he
played
with
boiling
steel
second
engineer
at
sea
is
that
so
hum
excuse
me
but
are
you
intending
to
wear
that
dress
mildred
why
not
second
engineer
you
likely
rub
against
oil
and
dirt
it
ca
be
helped
mildred
it
does
matter
i
have
lots
of
white
dresses
second
engineer
i
have
an
old
coat
you
might
throw
over
mildred
i
have
fifty
dresses
like
this
i
will
throw
this
one
into
the
sea
when
i
come
back
that
ought
to
wash
it
clean
do
you
think
second
engineer
there
ladders
to
climb
down
that
are
none
too
clean
and
dark
alleyways
mildred
i
will
wear
this
very
dress
and
none
other
second
engineer
no
offence
meant
it
none
of
my
business
i
was
only
warning
you
mildred
warning
that
sounds
thrilling
second
engineer
down
the
deck
with
a
sigh
of
there
the
fourth
now
he
waiting
for
us
if
you
come
mildred
go
on
i
follow
you
goes
mildred
turns
a
mocking
smile
on
her
an
oaf
but
a
handsome
virile
oaf
aunt
poser
mildred
take
care
he
said
there
were
dark
alleyways
aunt
the
same
poser
mildred
her
lips
you
are
right
but
would
that
my
millions
were
not
so
anemically
chaste
aunt
yes
for
a
fresh
pose
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
drag
the
name
of
douglas
in
the
gutter
mildred
from
which
it
sprang
aunt
do
pray
too
hard
that
i
may
fall
into
the
fiery
furnace

old
hag
slaps
her
aunt
insultingly
across
the

scene
iii
scene
the
stokehole
in
the
rear
the
bulks
of
the
furnaces
and
boilers
high
overhead
one
hanging
electric
bulb
sheds
just
enough
light
through
the
murky
air
laden
with
coal
dust
to
pile
up
masses
of
shadows
everywhere
a
line
of
men
stripped
to
the
waist
is
before
the
furnace
doors
they
bend
over
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
handling
their
shovels
as
if
they
were
part
of
their
bodies
with
a
strange
awkward
swinging
rhythm
they
use
the
shovels
to
throw
open
the
furnace
doors
then
from
these
fiery
round
holes
in
the
black
a
flood
of
terrific
light
and
heat
pours
full
upon
the
men
who
are
outlined
in
silhouette
in
the
crouching
inhuman
attitudes
of
chained
gorillas
the
men
shovel
with
a
rhythmic
motion
swinging
as
on
a
pivot
from
the
coal
which
lies
in
heaps
on
the
floor
behind
to
hurl
it
into
the
flaming
mouths
before
them
there
is
a
tumult
of
noise
the
brazen
clang
of
the
furnace
doors
as
they
are
flung
open
or
slammed
shut
the
grating
grind
of
steel
against
steel
of
crunching
coal
this
clash
of
sounds
stuns
one
ears
with
its
rending
dissonance
but
there
is
order
in
it
rhythm
a
mechanical
regulated
recurrence
a
tempo
and
rising
above
all
making
the
air
hum
with
the
quiver
of
liberated
energy
the
roar
of
leaping
flames
in
the
furnaces
the
monotonous
throbbing
beat
of
the
engines
as
the
curtain
rises
the
furnace
doors
are
shut
the
men
are
taking
a
breathing
spell
one
or
two
are
arranging
the
coal
behind
them
pulling
it
into
more
accessible
heaps

steps

turning
to
get
coal
when
the
whistle
sounds
again
in
a
peremptory
irritating
note
this
drives
yank
into
a
sudden
fury
while
the
other
men
have
turned
full
around
and
stopped
dumfounded
by
the
spectacle
of
mildred
standing
there
in
her
white
dress
yank
does
not
turn
far
enough
to
see
her
besides
his
head
is
thrown
back
he
blinks
upward
through
the
murk
trying
to
find
the
owner
of
the
whistle
he
brandishes
his
shovel
murderously
over
his
head
in
one
hand
pounding
on
his
chest
with
the

shouting

conscious
of
all
the
other

staring
at
something
directly
behind
his
back
he
whirls
defensively
with
a
snarling
murderous
growl
crouching
to
spring
his
lips
drawn
back
his
teeth
his
small
eyes
gleaming
ferociously
he
sees
mildred
like
a
white
apparition
in
the
full
light
from
the
open
furnace
doors
he
glares
into
her
eyes
turned
to
stone
as
for
her
during
his
speech
she
has
listened
paralyzed
with
horror
terror
her
whole
personality
crushed
beaten
in
collapsed
by
the
terrific
impact
of
this
unknown
abysmal
brutality
naked
and
shameless
as
she
looks
at
his
gorilla
face
as
his
eyes
bore
into
hers
she
utters
a
low
choking
cry
and
shrinks
away
from
him
putting
both
hands
up
before
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
his
face
to
protect
her
own
this
startles
yank
to
a
reaction
his
mouth
falls
open
his
eyes
grow
mildred
to
faint
to
the
engineers
who
now
have
her
one
by
each
arm
take
me
away
oh
the
filthy
beast
faints
they
carry
her
quickly
back
disappearing
in
the
darkness
at
the
left
rear
an
iron
door
clangs
shut
rage
and
bewildered
fury
rush
back
on
yank
he
feels
himself
insulted
in
some
unknown
fashion
in
the
very
heart
of
his
pride
he
roars
god
damn
yuh
hurls
his
shovel
after
them
at
the
door
which
has
just
closed
it
hits
the
steel
bulkhead
with
a
clang
and
falls
clattering
on
the
steel
floor
from
overhead
the
whistle
sounds
again
in

long
angry
insistent
scene

around
their
eyes
where
a
hasty
dousing
does
not
touch
the
coal
dust
sticks
like
black
giving
them
a
queer
sinister
expression

not

stands
out
in

to
them
a
blackened
brooding
figure

attitude
of

gray
light
falls
on
the
front
of
one
cage
so
that
the
interior
can
be
seen
the
other
cages
are
vague
shrouded
in
shadow
from
which
chatterings
pitched
in
a
conversational
tone
can
be
heard
on
the
one
cage
a
sign
from
which
the

stands
out

attitude

leaning
over
the
railing
stares
in
at
its
occupant
who
stares
back
at
him
silent
and
motionless
there
is
a
pause
of
dead
stillness
then
yank
begins
to
talk
in
a
friendly
confidential
tone
but
with
a
deep
undercurrent
of
