a
chambermaid
diary
by
octave
mirbeau
translated
from
the
french
by
benj
tucker
new
york
benj
tucker
publisher
a
french
chambermaid
who
has
served
in
paris
in
the
houses
of
the
nobility
the
bourgeois
and
professional
people
finally
enters
the
service
of
a
rich
couple
living
in
the
country
and
there
begins
to
keep
a
diary
in
describing
the
events
of
her
daily
life
and
the
people
about
her
she
is
frequently
reminded
of
episodes
in
her
past
and
digresses
to
relate
them
thus
her
diary
becomes
a
piquant
panorama
of
social
life
and
institutions
it
is
a
terrific
social
exposure
a
grim
social
satire
crammed
with
humor
bitterness
and
truth
it
has
been
described
by
a
french
critic
as
an
attempt
to
show
that
nearly
all
the
masters
are
wretches
and
that
nearly
all
the
servants
are
as
near
like
them
as
they
know
how
to
be
to
monsieur
octave
mirbeau
i
offer
you
my
sincere
apology
for
mutilating
your
brave
and
admirable
work
in
publishing
it
in
english
i
have
omitted
certain
portions
much
against
my
inclination
perhaps
you
who
live
in
a
land
that
enjoys
a
greater
freedom
of
the
press
than
we
know
in
the
united
states
will
wonder
why
i
was
forced
to
do
this
let
me
then
explain
to
you
that
the
men
whose
ugly
souls
your
célestine
does
not
hesitate
to
lay
bare
are
types
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
of
most
of
the
men
whom
we
place
in
our
halls
of
legislation
to
make
our
laws
in
our
halls
of
administration
to
execute
them
and
in
our
halls
of
justice
to
interpret
and
enforce
them
and
that
among
the
laws
which
they
have
made
are
some
aimed
ostensibly
at
the
suppression
of
obscene
literature
that
are
really
intended
to
protect
from
exposure
their
own
obscene
lives
and
those
of
others
of
their
ilk
and
to
protect
from
attack
the
social
evils
and
political
institutions
upon
which
they
thrive
these
lawless
hope
by
obscuring
the
sufficiently
sharp
line
that
divides
the
vulgar
appeal
to
eroticism
from
the
earnest
narrative
of
the
honest
thinker
and
the
truthful
picture
of
the
conscientious
artist
to
brand
both
with
the
same
condemnation
and
thus
secure
immunity
for
those
who
by
all
the
various
forms
of
exploitation
deal
as
célestine
bluntly
says
in
human
meat
this
is
why
it
is
unsafe
to
publish
in
the
english
language
those
portions
of
her
diary
which
i
have
omitted
but
if
as
i
hope
and
believe
the
portions
that
are
here
printed
shall
do
something
to
change
the
public
opinion
that
sanctions
the
claim
of
these
to
legislative
power
i
am
sure
that
you
will
excuse
a
liberty
which
under
other
circumstances
would
be
an
inexcusable
act
of
vandalism
benj
tucker
to
monsieur
jules
huret
my
dear
friend
for
two
reasons
very
strong
and
very
precise
it
is
my
wish
to
inscribe
your
name
at
the
head
of
these
pages
first
that
you
may
know
how
dear
your
name
is
to
me
second
and
i
say
it
with
a
tranquil
pride
because
you
will
like
this
book
and
you
will
like
it
in
spite
of
all
its
faults
because
it
is
a
book
free
from
hypocrisy
because
it
portrays
life
life
as
you
and
i
understand
it
i
have
always
in
my
mind
eye
my
dear
huret
many
of
the
faces
so
strangely
human
which
you
have
arrayed
in
procession
in
a
long
series
of
social
and
literary
studies
they
haunt
me
it
is
because
no
one
better
than
you
and
more
profoundly
than
you
has
felt
when
surveying
these
human
masqueraders
how
sad
and
how
comical
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
man
may
you
find
again
in
these
pages
that
sadness
which
makes
lofty
souls
laugh
that
comicality
which
makes
them
weep
octave
mirbeau
may
book
that
i
publish
under
this
title
a
chambermaid
diary
was
really
written
by
mlle
célestine
r
chambermaid
when
i
was
asked
to
revise
the
manuscript
to
correct
it
and
to
rewrite
some
parts
of
it
i
refused
at
first
thinking
not
without
reason
that
just
as
it
was
in
all
its
disorder
this
diary
had
a
certain
originality
a
special
savor
and
that
i
could
only
render
it
commonplace
by
putting
into
it
anything
of
myself
but
mlle
célestine
r
was
very
pretty
she
insisted
i
finally
yielded
for
after
all
i
am
a
confess
that
i
was
wrong
in
doing
this
work
which
she
asked
of
me
that
is
in
adding
here
and
there
some
accents
to
this
book
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
i
have
impaired
its
somewhat
corrosive
grace
diminished
its
sad
power
and
above
all
substituted
simple
literature
for
the
emotion
and
life
which
these
pages
say
this
to
answer
in
advance
the
objections
which
certain
grave
and
learned
and
how
noble
critics
will
not
fail
to
a
chambermaid
diary
i
september
at
three
in
the
afternoon
in
mild
gray
and
rainy
weather
i
have
entered
upon
my
new
place
it
is
the
twelfth
in
two
years
of
course
i
say
nothing
of
the
places
which
i
held
in
previous
years
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
count
them
ah
i
can
boast
of
having
seen
interiors
and
faces
and
dirty
souls
and
the
end
is
not
yet
judging
from
the
really
extraordinary
and
dizzy
way
in
which
i
have
rolled
here
and
there
successively
from
houses
to
and
from
to
houses
from
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
the
bastille
from
the
observatory
to
montmartre
from
the
ternes
to
the
gobelins
everywhere
without
ever
succeeding
in
establishing
myself
anywhere
the
masters
in
these
days
must
be
hard
to
please
it
is
incredible
the
affair
was
arranged
through
an
advertisement
in
the
figaro
and
without
any
interview
with
madame
we
wrote
letters
to
each
other
that
is
all
a
risky
method
often
resulting
in
surprises
on
both
sides
madame
letters
are
well
written
it
is
true
but
they
reveal
a
meddlesome
and
fastidious
character
ah
the
explanations
and
the
commentaries
that
she
insisted
upon
the
whys
and
the
becauses
i
do
not
know
whether
madame
is
stingy
at
any
rate
she
is
hardly
ruining
herself
with
her
it
is
bought
at
the
louvre
i
am
not
rich
but
i
have
more
elegance
than
that
i
write
on
paper
perfumed
la
peau
beautiful
paper
some
of
it
pink
some
light
blue
which
i
have
collected
from
my
former
mistresses
some
of
it
even
bears
a
countess
coronet
engraved
upon
it
that
must
have
been
a
crusher
for
her
well
at
last
here
i
am
in
normandy
at
madame
estate
which
is
not
far
from
the
country
is
called
the
priory
this
is
almost
all
that
i
know
of
the
spot
where
henceforth
i
am
to
live
i
am
not
without
anxiety
or
without
regret
at
having
come
in
consequence
of
a
moment
rashness
to
bury
myself
in
the
depths
of
the
country
what
i
have
seen
of
it
frightens
me
a
little
and
i
ask
myself
what
further
is
going
to
happen
to
me
here
doubtless
nothing
good
and
the
usual
worries
to
worry
is
the
clearest
of
our
privileges
for
every
one
who
succeeds
that
is
for
every
one
who
marries
a
worthy
young
fellow
or
forms
an
alliance
with
an
old
man
how
many
of
us
are
destined
to
swept
away
in
the
great
whirlwind
of
poverty
after
all
i
had
no
choice
and
this
is
better
than
nothing
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
had
a
place
in
the
country
four
years
ago
i
had
one
oh
not
for
long
and
in
really
exceptional
circumstances
i
remember
this
adventure
as
if
it
had
occurred
yesterday
although
the
details
are
slightly
indecorous
and
even
horrible
i
wish
to
relate
it
moreover
i
charitably
warn
my
readers
that
it
is
my
intention
in
writing
this
diary
to
keep
nothing
back
in
relation
either
to
myself
or
to
others
on
the
contrary
i
intend
to
put
into
it
all
the
frankness
that
is
in
me
and
when
necessary
all
the
brutality
that
is
in
life
it
is
not
my
fault
if
the
souls
from
which
we
tear
the
veils
and
which
then
appear
in
all
their
nakedness
exhale
so
strong
an
odor
of
rottenness
well
here
it
is
i
was
engaged
in
an
by
a
sort
of
fat
governess
to
be
a
chambermaid
in
the
house
of
a
certain
rabour
in
touraine
the
conditions
accepted
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
take
the
train
on
such
a
day
at
such
an
hour
for
such
a
station
which
was
done
according
to
the
programme
as
soon
as
i
had
given
up
my
ticket
at
the
exit
i
found
outside
a
sort
of
coachman
with
a
rubicund
and
churlish
face
who
asked
me
are
you
rabour
new
chambermaid
yes
have
you
a
trunk
yes
i
have
a
trunk
give
me
your
baggage
ticket
and
wait
for
me
here
he
made
his
way
to
the
platform
the
employees
hastened
about
him
they
called
him
monsieur
louis
in
a
tone
of
friendly
respect
louis
looked
for
my
trunk
in
the
pile
of
baggage
and
had
it
placed
in
an
english
cart
that
stood
near
the
exit
well
will
you
get
in
i
took
my
seat
beside
him
and
we
started
the
coachman
looked
at
me
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
i
examined
him
similarly
i
saw
at
once
that
i
had
to
do
with
a
countryman
an
unpolished
peasant
an
untrained
domestic
who
had
never
served
in
grand
establishments
that
annoyed
me
for
my
part
i
like
handsome
liveries
i
dote
on
nothing
so
much
as
on
white
leather
tightly
fitting
nervous
thighs
and
how
lacking
in
elegance
he
was
this
louis
without
with
a
full
suit
of
drugget
that
was
too
big
for
him
and
a
flat
cap
of
glazed
leather
ornamented
with
a
double
row
of
gold
lace
no
indeed
they
are
slow
in
this
region
and
with
all
a
scowling
brutal
air
but
not
a
bad
fellow
at
bottom
i
know
these
types
at
first
they
assume
a
knowing
air
with
the
new
people
and
later
a
more
friendly
footing
is
arrived
at
often
more
friendly
than
one
would
like
we
sat
a
long
time
without
saying
a
word
he
assumed
the
manners
of
a
grand
coachman
holding
the
reins
high
and
swinging
his
whip
with
rounded
gestures
oh
how
ridiculous
he
was
for
my
part
with
much
dignity
i
surveyed
the
landscape
which
had
no
special
feature
simply
fields
trees
and
houses
just
as
everywhere
else
he
brought
his
horse
down
to
a
walk
in
order
to
ascend
a
hill
and
then
suddenly
with
a
quizzing
smile
he
asked
i
suppose
that
at
least
you
have
brought
a
good
supply
of
shoes
undoubtedly
said
i
astonished
at
this
question
which
rhymed
with
nothing
and
still
more
at
the
singular
tone
in
which
he
put
it
to
me
why
do
you
ask
me
that
it
is
a
rather
stupid
question
do
you
know
my
old
man
he
nudged
me
slightly
with
his
elbow
and
gliding
over
me
a
strange
look
whose
expression
of
keen
irony
and
indeed
of
jovial
obscenity
was
unintelligible
to
me
he
said
with
a
chuckle
oh
yes
pretend
that
you
know
nothing
you
are
a
good
one
you
are
a
jolly
good
one
then
he
clacked
his
tongue
and
the
horse
resumed
its
rapid
gait
i
was
puzzled
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
perhaps
nothing
at
all
i
concluded
that
the
good
man
was
a
little
silly
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
talk
with
women
and
that
he
had
been
able
to
think
of
no
other
way
to
start
a
conversation
which
however
i
did
not
see
fit
to
continue
rabour
estate
was
sufficiently
large
and
beautiful
a
pretty
house
painted
light
green
and
surrounded
by
broad
lawns
adorned
with
flowers
and
by
a
pine
forest
which
gave
forth
an
odor
of
turpentine
i
adore
the
country
but
oddly
enough
it
makes
me
sad
and
sleepy
i
was
utterly
stupid
when
i
entered
the
vestibule
where
the
governess
was
awaiting
me
she
who
had
engaged
me
at
the
paris
god
knows
after
how
many
indiscreet
questions
as
to
my
private
habits
and
tastes
which
ought
to
have
made
me
distrustful
but
in
vain
does
one
see
and
endure
things
stronger
and
stronger
they
never
teach
you
anything
the
governess
had
not
pleased
me
at
the
here
she
instantly
disgusted
me
she
seemed
to
me
to
have
the
air
of
an
old
procuress
she
was
a
fat
woman
and
short
with
yellowish
flesh
hair
brushed
flat
and
turning
gray
huge
and
rolling
breasts
and
soft
damp
hands
as
transparent
as
gelatine
her
grey
eyes
indicated
wickedness
a
cold
calculating
vicious
wickedness
the
tranquil
and
cruel
way
in
which
she
looked
at
you
searching
soul
and
flesh
was
almost
enough
to
make
you
blush
she
escorted
me
into
a
little
and
at
once
left
me
saying
that
she
was
going
to
notify
monsieur
that
monsieur
wished
to
see
me
before
i
should
begin
my
service
for
monsieur
has
not
seen
you
she
added
i
have
taken
you
it
is
true
but
then
it
is
necessary
that
you
please
monsieur
i
inspected
the
room
it
was
extremely
clean
and
orderly
the
brasses
the
furniture
the
floor
the
doors
thoroughly
polished
waxed
varnished
shone
like
mirrors
no
no
heavy
hangings
no
embroidered
stuffs
such
as
are
seen
in
certain
paris
houses
but
serious
comfort
an
air
of
rich
decency
of
substantial
country
life
regular
and
calm
but
my
how
tiresome
it
must
be
to
live
here
monsieur
entered
oh
the
queer
man
and
how
he
amused
me
fancy
a
little
old
man
looking
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
freshly
shaven
and
as
pink
as
a
doll
very
erect
very
sprightly
very
inviting
in
fact
he
hopped
about
in
walking
like
a
little
grasshopper
in
the
fields
he
saluted
me
and
then
asked
with
infinite
politeness
what
is
your
name
my
child
célestine
monsieur
célestine
he
exclaimed
célestine
the
devil
it
is
a
pretty
name
that
i
do
not
deny
but
too
long
my
child
much
too
long
i
will
call
you
marie
if
you
are
willing
that
is
a
very
nice
name
too
and
it
is
short
and
besides
i
have
called
all
my
chambermaids
marie
it
is
a
habit
which
it
would
distress
me
to
abandon
i
would
rather
abandon
the
person
they
all
have
this
queer
mania
of
never
calling
you
by
your
real
name
i
was
not
too
much
astonished
having
already
borne
all
the
names
of
all
the
saints
in
the
calendar
he
persisted
so
it
will
not
displease
you
if
i
call
you
marie
that
is
agreed
is
it
why
certainly
monsieur
a
pretty
girl
good
character
very
well
very
well
he
had
said
all
this
to
me
in
a
sprightly
and
extremely
respectful
way
and
without
staring
at
me
without
seeming
to
undress
me
with
his
eyes
after
the
fashion
of
men
generally
scarcely
had
he
looked
at
me
from
the
moment
that
he
entered
the
room
his
eyes
had
remained
obstinately
fixed
upon
my
shoes
you
have
others
he
asked
after
a
short
silence
during
which
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
eyes
became
strangely
brilliant
other
names
monsieur
no
my
child
other
shoes
and
with
a
slender
tongue
he
licked
his
lips
after
the
manner
of
cats
i
did
not
answer
at
once
this
word
shoes
reminding
me
of
the
coachman
salacious
joke
had
astounded
me
then
that
had
a
meaning
on
a
more
pressing
interrogation
i
finally
answered
but
in
a
voice
somewhat
hoarse
and
thick
as
if
i
were
confessing
a
sin
of
gallantry
yes
monsieur
i
have
others
glazed
yes
monsieur
highly
highly
glazed
why
yes
monsieur
good
good
and
of
yellow
leather
i
have
none
of
that
kind
monsieur
you
will
have
to
have
some
i
will
give
you
some
thank
you
monsieur
good
good
be
still
i
was
frightened
for
dull
gleams
had
just
passed
over
his
eyes
and
drops
of
sweat
were
rolling
down
his
forehead
thinking
that
he
was
about
to
faint
i
was
on
the
point
of
shouting
of
calling
for
help
but
the
crisis
quieted
down
and
after
a
few
minutes
he
continued
in
a
calmer
voice
though
a
little
saliva
still
foamed
at
the
corner
of
his
lips
it
is
nothing
it
is
over
understand
me
my
child
i
am
a
little
of
a
maniac
at
my
age
that
is
allowed
is
it
not
for
instance
i
do
not
think
it
proper
that
a
woman
should
black
her
own
shoes
much
less
mine
i
have
a
great
respect
for
women
marie
and
can
not
endure
that
so
i
will
black
your
shoes
your
little
shoes
your
dear
little
shoes
i
will
take
care
of
them
listen
to
me
every
evening
before
going
to
bed
you
will
carry
your
shoes
into
my
room
you
will
place
them
near
the
bed
on
a
little
table
and
every
morning
on
coming
to
open
my
windows
you
will
take
them
away
again
and
as
i
manifested
a
prodigious
astonishment
he
added
oh
now
it
is
nothing
enormous
that
i
ask
of
you
it
is
a
very
natural
thing
after
all
and
if
you
are
very
nice
quickly
he
took
from
his
pocket
two
louis
which
he
handed
to
me
if
you
are
very
nice
very
obedient
i
will
often
make
you
little
presents
the
governess
will
pay
you
your
wages
every
month
but
between
ourselves
marie
i
shall
often
make
you
little
presents
and
what
is
it
that
i
ask
of
you
come
now
it
is
not
extraordinary
is
it
then
indeed
so
extraordinary
monsieur
was
getting
excited
again
as
he
spoke
his
eyelids
rapidly
rose
and
fell
like
leaves
in
a
tempest
why
do
you
say
nothing
marie
say
something
why
do
you
not
walk
walk
a
little
that
i
may
see
them
move
that
i
may
see
them
live
your
little
shoes
he
knelt
down
kissed
my
shoes
kneaded
them
with
his
feverish
and
caressing
fingers
unlaced
them
and
while
kissing
kneading
and
caressing
them
he
said
in
a
supplicating
voice
in
the
voice
of
a
weeping
child
oh
marie
marie
your
little
shoes
give
them
to
me
directly
directly
directly
i
want
them
directly
give
them
to
me
i
was
powerless
astonishment
had
paralyzed
me
i
did
not
know
whether
i
was
really
living
or
dreaming
of
monsieur
eyes
i
saw
nothing
but
two
little
white
globes
streaked
with
red
and
his
mouth
was
all
daubed
with
a
sort
of
soapy
foam
at
last
he
took
my
shoes
away
and
shut
himself
up
with
them
in
his
room
for
two
hours
monsieur
is
much
pleased
with
you
said
the
governess
to
me
in
showing
me
over
the
house
try
to
continue
to
please
him
the
place
is
a
good
one
four
days
later
in
the
morning
on
going
at
the
usual
hour
to
open
the
windows
i
came
near
fainting
with
horror
in
the
chamber
monsieur
was
dead
stretched
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
he
lay
with
all
the
rigidity
of
a
corpse
he
had
not
struggled
the
was
not
disarranged
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
shock
of
agony
of
clinched
hands
striving
to
strangle
death
and
i
should
have
thought
him
asleep
if
his
face
had
not
been
violet
frightfully
violet
the
sinister
violet
of
the
and
terrifying
spectacle
which
still
more
than
this
face
caused
me
to
quake
with
fear
monsieur
held
pressed
between
his
teeth
one
of
my
shoes
so
firmly
pressed
between
his
teeth
that
after
useless
and
horrible
efforts
i
was
obliged
to
cut
the
leather
with
a
razor
in
order
to
tear
it
from
him
i
am
no
saint
i
have
known
many
men
and
i
know
by
experience
all
the
madness
all
the
vileness
of
which
they
are
capable
but
a
man
like
monsieur
oh
indeed
is
it
not
ridiculous
all
the
same
that
such
types
exist
and
where
do
they
go
in
search
of
all
their
conceits
when
it
is
so
simple
and
so
good
to
love
each
other
prettily
as
other
people
do
i
do
not
think
that
anything
of
that
kind
will
happen
to
me
here
here
evidently
they
are
of
another
sort
but
is
it
better
is
it
worse
as
to
that
i
know
nothing
there
is
one
thing
that
torments
me
i
ought
perhaps
to
have
finished
once
for
all
with
all
these
dirty
places
and
squarely
taken
the
step
from
domesticity
into
gallantry
like
so
many
others
that
i
have
known
and
who
i
say
it
without
pride
had
fewer
advantages
than
i
though
i
am
not
what
is
called
pretty
i
am
better
without
conceit
i
may
say
that
i
have
an
atmosphere
a
style
which
many
society
women
and
many
women
of
the
have
often
envied
me
a
little
tall
perhaps
but
supple
slender
and
with
very
beautiful
blonde
hair
very
beautiful
eyes
an
audacious
mouth
and
finally
an
original
manner
and
a
turn
of
mind
very
lively
and
languishing
at
once
that
pleases
men
i
might
have
succeeded
but
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
by
my
own
fault
i
have
missed
some
astonishing
opportunities
which
probably
will
never
come
to
me
again
i
have
been
afraid
i
have
been
afraid
for
one
never
knows
where
that
will
lead
you
i
have
rubbed
against
so
many
miseries
in
that
sphere
of
life
i
have
received
so
many
distressing
confidences
and
those
tragic
calvaries
from
the
depot
to
the
hospital
which
one
does
not
always
escape
and
for
a
background
to
the
picture
the
hell
of
such
things
cause
one
to
reflect
and
shudder
who
knows
too
whether
i
should
have
had
as
woman
the
same
success
that
i
have
had
as
chambermaid
the
particular
charm
which
we
exercise
over
men
does
not
lie
solely
in
ourselves
however
pretty
we
may
be
it
depends
largely
as
i
have
had
occasion
to
know
on
our
environment
on
the
luxury
and
vice
of
our
surroundings
on
our
mistresses
themselves
and
on
the
desire
which
they
excite
in
loving
us
it
is
a
little
of
them
and
much
of
their
mystery
that
men
love
in
us
but
there
is
something
else
in
spite
of
my
dissolute
life
i
have
luckily
preserved
in
the
depths
of
my
being
a
very
sincere
religious
feeling
which
saves
me
from
definitive
falls
and
holds
me
back
at
the
edge
of
the
worst
abysses
ah
if
there
were
no
religion
if
on
evenings
of
gloom
and
moral
distress
there
were
no
prayer
in
the
churches
if
it
were
not
for
the
holy
virgin
and
saint
anthony
of
padua
and
all
the
rest
of
the
outfit
we
should
be
much
more
unhappy
that
is
sure
and
what
would
become
of
us
and
how
far
we
should
go
the
devil
only
knows
finally
and
this
is
more
serious
i
have
not
the
least
defence
against
men
i
should
be
the
constant
victim
of
my
disinterestedness
and
their
pleasure
i
am
too
amorous
yes
i
am
too
much
in
love
with
love
to
draw
any
profit
whatever
out
of
love
it
is
stronger
than
i
i
can
not
ask
money
of
one
who
gives
me
happiness
and
sets
ajar
for
me
the
radiant
gates
of
ecstasy
so
here
i
am
then
at
the
priory
awaiting
what
indeed
i
do
not
know
the
wisest
way
would
be
not
to
think
about
it
and
trust
everything
to
luck
perhaps
it
is
thus
that
things
go
best
provided
that
and
pursued
even
here
by
that
pitiless
mischance
which
never
leaves
me
i
am
not
forced
once
more
to
quit
my
place
that
would
annoy
me
for
some
time
i
have
had
pains
in
my
loins
a
feeling
of
weariness
in
my
whole
body
my
stomach
is
becoming
impaired
my
memory
is
weakening
i
am
growing
more
irritable
and
nervous
just
now
when
looking
in
the
glass
i
discovered
that
my
face
had
a
really
tired
look
and
that
my
complexion
that
amber
complexion
of
which
i
was
so
proud
had
taken
on
an
almost
ashen
hue
can
i
be
growing
old
already
i
do
not
wish
to
grow
old
yet
in
paris
it
is
difficult
to
take
care
of
one
self
there
is
no
time
for
anything
life
there
is
too
feverish
too
tumultuous
one
comes
continually
in
contact
with
too
many
people
too
many
things
too
many
pleasures
too
much
of
the
unexpected
but
you
have
to
go
on
just
the
same
here
it
is
calm
and
what
silence
the
air
that
one
breathes
must
be
healthy
and
good
ah
if
at
the
risk
of
being
bored
i
could
but
rest
a
little
in
the
first
place
i
have
no
confidence
certainly
madame
is
nice
enough
with
me
she
has
seen
fit
to
pay
me
some
compliments
on
my
appearance
and
to
congratulate
herself
on
the
reports
that
she
has
received
concerning
me
oh
her
head
if
she
knew
that
these
reports
are
false
or
at
least
that
they
were
given
simply
to
oblige
what
especially
astonishes
her
is
my
elegance
and
then
as
a
rule
they
are
nice
the
first
day
these
camels
while
all
is
new
all
is
beautiful
that
is
a
song
yes
and
the
next
day
the
air
changes
into
another
one
equally
well
known
especially
as
madame
has
very
cold
hard
eyes
which
do
not
please
me
the
eyes
of
a
miser
full
of
keen
suspicion
and
spying
inquiry
nor
do
i
like
her
dry
and
too
thin
lips
which
seem
to
be
covered
with
a
whitish
crust
or
her
curt
cutting
speech
which
turns
an
amiable
word
almost
into
an
insult
or
a
humiliation
when
in
questioning
me
concerning
this
or
that
concerning
my
aptitudes
and
my
past
she
looked
at
me
with
that
tranquil
and
sly
impudence
of
an
old
customs
official
which
they
all
have
i
said
to
myself
there
is
no
mistake
about
it
here
is
another
one
who
is
bound
to
put
everything
under
lock
and
key
to
count
every
evening
her
grapes
and
her
lumps
of
sugar
and
to
put
marks
on
the
bottles
oh
yes
indeed
we
change
and
change
but
we
find
always
the
same
thing
nevertheless
it
will
be
necessary
to
see
and
not
rely
on
this
first
impression
among
so
many
mouths
that
have
spoken
to
me
among
so
many
looks
that
have
searched
my
soul
i
shall
find
perhaps
some
day
who
knows
a
friendly
mouth
a
sympathetic
look
it
costs
me
nothing
to
hope
as
soon
as
i
had
arrived
still
under
the
deadening
influence
of
four
hours
in
a
railway
carriage
and
before
any
one
in
the
kitchen
had
even
thought
of
offering
me
a
slice
of
bread
madame
took
me
over
the
house
from
cellar
to
garret
in
order
to
immediately
familiarize
me
with
my
duties
oh
she
does
not
waste
her
time
or
mine
how
big
this
house
is
and
how
many
things
and
corners
it
contains
oh
no
thank
you
to
keep
it
in
order
as
it
should
be
four
servants
would
not
suffice
besides
the
ground
floor
which
in
itself
is
very
important
for
there
are
two
little
pavilions
in
the
form
of
a
terrace
which
constitute
additions
and
continuations
it
has
two
stories
in
which
i
shall
have
to
be
forever
going
up
and
down
since
madame
who
stays
in
a
little
room
near
the
has
had
the
ingenious
idea
of
placing
the
where
i
am
to
work
at
the
top
of
the
house
by
the
side
of
our
chambers
and
cupboards
and
bureaus
and
drawers
and
and
litters
of
all
sorts
if
you
like
these
things
there
are
plenty
of
them
never
shall
i
find
myself
in
all
this
at
every
minute
in
showing
me
something
madame
said
to
me
you
will
have
to
be
careful
about
this
my
girl
this
is
very
pretty
my
girl
this
is
very
rare
my
girl
this
is
very
expensive
my
girl
she
could
not
then
call
me
by
my
name
instead
of
saying
all
the
time
my
girl
this
my
girl
that
in
that
tone
of
wounding
domination
which
discourages
the
best
wills
and
straightway
puts
such
a
distance
so
much
hatred
between
our
mistresses
and
us
do
i
call
her
little
mother
and
then
madame
has
always
on
her
lips
the
words
very
expensive
it
is
provoking
everything
that
belongs
to
her
even
paltry
articles
that
cost
four
sous
are
very
expensive
one
has
no
idea
where
the
vanity
of
the
mistress
of
a
house
can
hide
itself
it
is
really
pitiful
in
explaining
to
me
the
working
of
an
oil
lamp
which
in
no
way
differed
from
all
other
lamps
she
said
to
me
my
girl
you
know
that
this
lamp
is
very
expensive
and
that
it
can
be
repaired
only
in
england
take
care
of
it
as
if
it
were
the
apple
of
your
eye
oh
the
cheek
that
they
have
and
the
fuss
that
they
make
about
nothing
and
when
i
think
that
it
is
all
done
just
to
humiliate
you
to
astonish
you
and
the
house
is
not
so
much
after
all
there
is
really
no
reason
to
be
so
proud
of
it
the
exterior
to
be
sure
with
the
great
clusters
of
trees
that
sumptuously
frame
it
and
the
gardens
that
descend
to
the
river
in
gentle
slopes
ornamented
with
broad
rectangular
lawns
gives
an
impression
of
some
importance
but
within
it
is
sad
old
rickety
and
has
a
musty
smell
i
do
not
understand
how
they
can
live
in
it
nothing
but
rats
nests
wooden
stairways
whose
warped
steps
tremble
and
creak
beneath
your
feet
low
and
dark
whose
floors
instead
of
being
covered
with
soft
carpets
consist
of
tiles
of
a
faded
red
color
and
glazed
glazed
slippery
slippery
the
too
thin
partitions
made
of
too
dry
planks
make
the
chambers
as
sonorous
as
the
inside
of
a
violin
oh
it
is
all
hollow
and
provincial
it
surely
is
not
furnished
in
the
paris
fashion
in
all
the
rooms
old
mahogany
old
stuffs
old
faded
rugs
and
and
sofas
ridiculously
stiff
without
springs
and
rickety
how
they
must
grind
one
shoulders
really
i
who
am
so
fond
of
hangings
broad
elastic
divans
where
one
can
stretch
voluptuously
on
heaps
of
cushions
and
all
these
pretty
modern
furnishings
so
luxurious
so
rich
and
so
gay
i
feel
utterly
saddened
by
the
gloomy
sadness
of
these
and
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
never
get
accustomed
to
such
an
absence
of
comfort
to
such
a
lack
of
elegance
to
so
much
old
dust
and
so
many
dead
forms
nor
is
madame
dressed
in
parisian
fashion
she
is
lacking
in
style
and
is
unacquainted
with
the
great
dressmakers
she
is
somewhat
of
a
fright
as
they
say
although
she
shows
a
certain
pretension
in
her
costumes
she
is
at
least
ten
years
behind
the
fashion
and
what
a
fashion
still
she
would
not
be
if
she
chose
not
to
be
at
least
she
would
not
be
too
her
worst
fault
is
that
she
awakens
in
you
no
sympathy
that
she
is
a
woman
in
nothing
but
she
has
regular
features
pretty
hair
naturally
blonde
and
a
beautiful
skin
in
fact
she
has
too
much
color
as
if
she
were
suffering
from
some
internal
malady
i
know
this
type
of
woman
and
i
am
not
to
be
deceived
by
the
brilliancy
of
their
complexion
they
are
pink
on
the
surface
yes
but
within
they
are
rotten
they
can
not
stand
up
straight
they
can
not
walk
they
can
not
live
except
by
the
aid
of
girdles
trusses
pessaries
and
a
whole
collection
of
secret
horrors
and
complex
mechanisms
which
does
not
prevent
them
from
making
a
show
in
society
yes
indeed
they
are
coquettish
if
you
please
they
flirt
in
the
corners
they
exhibit
their
painted
flesh
they
ogle
they
wiggle
and
yet
they
are
fit
for
nothing
but
preservation
in
alcohol
oh
misfortune
one
has
but
little
satisfaction
with
them
i
assure
you
and
it
is
not
always
agreeable
to
be
in
their
service
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
from
temperament
or
from
organic
indisposition
but
judging
from
the
expression
of
madame
face
her
severe
gestures
and
the
stiff
bending
of
her
body
she
cares
nothing
at
all
for
love
she
has
the
sharpness
and
sourness
of
an
old
maid
and
her
whole
person
seems
dried
up
and
mummified
a
rare
thing
with
blondes
not
such
women
as
madame
does
beautiful
music
like
that
of
faust
oh
that
faust
cause
to
fall
with
languor
and
swoon
voluptuously
in
the
arms
of
a
handsome
man
oh
no
indeed
she
does
not
belong
to
that
class
of
very
ugly
women
into
whose
faces
the
ardor
of
sex
sometimes
puts
so
much
of
radiant
life
so
much
of
seductive
beauty
after
all
though
one
can
not
trust
too
securely
in
airs
like
those
of
madame
i
have
known
women
of
the
most
severe
and
crabbed
type
who
drove
away
all
thought
of
desire
and
love
and
who
yet
were
famous
rovers
although
madame
forces
herself
to
be
amiable
she
surely
is
not
up
to
date
like
some
that
i
have
seen
i
believe
her
to
be
very
wicked
very
spying
very
a
dirty
character
and
a
wicked
heart
she
must
be
continually
at
people
heels
pestering
them
in
all
ways
do
you
know
how
to
do
this
and
do
you
know
how
to
do
that
or
again
are
you
in
the
habit
of
breaking
things
are
you
careful
have
you
a
good
memory
are
you
orderly
there
is
no
end
to
it
and
also
are
you
clean
i
am
very
particular
about
cleanliness
i
pass
over
many
things
but
i
insist
upon
cleanliness
does
she
take
me
for
a
farm
girl
a
peasant
a
country
servant
cleanliness
oh
i
know
that
chestnut
they
all
say
that
and
often
when
one
goes
to
the
bottom
of
things
when
one
turns
up
their
skirts
and
examines
their
linen
how
filthy
they
are
sometimes
it
is
disgusting
enough
to
turn
stomach
consequently
i
distrust
madame
cleanliness
when
she
showed
me
her
i
did
not
notice
any
bath
or
any
of
the
things
that
are
necessary
to
a
woman
who
takes
proper
care
of
herself
and
what
a
scant
supply
she
has
of
bottles
and
all
those
private
and
perfumed
articles
with
which
i
am
so
fond
of
messing
i
long
for
the
sake
of
amusement
to
see
madame
naked
she
must
be
a
pretty
sight
in
the
evening
as
i
was
setting
the
table
monsieur
entered
the
he
had
just
returned
from
a
hunt
he
is
a
very
tall
man
with
broad
shoulders
a
heavy
black
moustache
and
a
dull
complexion
his
manners
are
a
little
heavy
and
awkward
but
he
seems
evidently
he
is
not
a
man
of
genius
like
jules
lemaître
whom
i
have
so
often
served
in
the
rue
or
a
man
of
elegance
like
de
janzé
ah
de
janzé
there
was
a
man
for
you
yet
he
is
sympathetic
his
thick
and
curly
hair
his
bull
neck
his
calves
that
look
like
a
wrestler
his
thick
intensely
red
and
smiling
lips
testify
to
his
strength
and
good
humor
he
is
not
indifferent
that
i
saw
directly
from
his
mobile
sniffing
sensual
nose
and
from
his
extremely
brilliant
eyes
which
are
at
once
gentle
and
never
i
think
have
i
met
a
human
being
with
such
eyebrows
thick
to
the
point
of
obscenity
and
with
so
hairy
hands
like
most
men
of
little
intelligence
and
great
muscular
development
he
is
very
timid
he
surveyed
me
with
a
very
queer
air
an
air
in
which
there
was
kindness
surprise
and
satisfaction
something
also
of
salaciousness
but
without
impudence
something
of
an
undressing
look
but
without
brutality
it
is
evident
that
monsieur
is
not
accustomed
to
such
chambermaids
as
i
that
i
astonish
him
and
that
i
have
made
a
great
impression
on
him
at
the
start
he
said
to
me
with
a
little
embarrassment
ah
ah
so
you
are
the
new
chambermaid
i
bent
forward
slightly
lowered
my
eyes
and
then
modest
and
mutinous
at
once
i
answered
simply
in
my
gentlest
voice
why
yes
monsieur
then
he
stammered
so
you
have
come
that
very
good
that
very
good
he
would
have
liked
to
say
something
further
was
trying
indeed
to
think
of
something
to
say
but
being
neither
eloquent
or
at
his
ease
he
did
not
find
anything
i
was
greatly
amused
at
his
embarrassment
but
after
a
short
silence
he
asked
you
come
from
paris
like
that
yes
monsieur
that
very
good
that
very
good
and
growing
bolder
what
is
your
name
célestine
monsieur
he
rubbed
his
hands
a
mannerism
of
his
and
went
on
célestine
ah
ah
that
very
good
not
a
common
name
in
fact
a
pretty
name
provided
madame
does
not
oblige
you
to
change
it
she
has
that
mania
i
answered
in
a
tone
of
dignified
submission
i
am
at
madame
disposition
undoubtedly
undoubtedly
but
it
is
a
pretty
name
i
almost
burst
out
laughing
monsieur
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
then
suddenly
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
stretched
out
his
legs
and
putting
into
his
look
something
like
an
apology
and
into
his
voice
something
like
a
prayer
he
asked
well
célestine
for
my
part
i
shall
always
call
you
célestine
will
you
help
me
to
take
off
my
boots
that
does
not
annoy
you
i
hope
certainly
not
monsieur
because
you
see
these
confounded
boots
are
very
difficult
to
manage
they
come
off
very
hard
with
a
movement
that
i
tried
to
make
harmonious
and
supple
and
even
provocative
i
knelt
before
him
and
while
i
was
helping
him
to
take
off
his
boots
which
were
damp
and
covered
with
mud
i
was
perfectly
conscious
that
the
perfumes
of
my
neck
were
exciting
his
nose
and
that
his
eyes
were
following
with
increasing
interest
the
outlines
of
my
form
as
seen
through
my
gown
suddenly
he
murmured
great
heavens
célestine
but
you
smell
good
without
raising
my
eyes
i
assumed
an
air
of
innocence
i
monsieur
surely
you
it
can
hardly
be
my
feet
oh
monsieur
and
this
oh
monsieur
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
a
protest
in
favor
of
his
feet
was
also
a
sort
of
friendly
reprimand
friendly
to
the
point
of
encouragement
for
his
familiarity
did
he
understand
i
think
so
for
again
with
more
force
and
even
with
a
sort
of
amorous
trembling
he
repeated
célestine
you
smell
awfully
good
awfully
good
ah
but
the
old
gentleman
is
making
free
i
appeared
as
if
slightly
scandalized
by
his
insistence
and
kept
silence
timid
as
he
is
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
tricks
of
women
monsieur
was
disturbed
he
feared
undoubtedly
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
suddenly
changing
his
idea
he
asked
are
you
getting
accustomed
to
the
place
célestine
that
question
was
i
getting
accustomed
to
the
place
and
i
had
been
there
but
three
hours
i
had
to
bite
my
lips
to
keep
from
laughing
the
old
gentleman
has
queer
ways
and
really
he
is
a
little
stupid
but
that
makes
no
difference
he
does
not
displease
me
in
his
very
vulgarity
he
reveals
a
certain
power
and
masculinity
which
are
not
disagreeable
to
me
when
his
boots
had
been
taken
off
and
to
leave
him
with
a
good
impression
of
me
i
asked
him
in
my
turn
i
see
monsieur
is
a
hunter
has
monsieur
had
a
good
hunt
i
never
have
good
hunts
célestine
he
answered
shaking
his
head
i
hunt
for
the
sake
of
walking
for
the
sake
of
riding
that
i
may
not
be
here
where
i
find
it
tiresome
ah
monsieur
finds
it
tiresome
here
after
a
pause
he
gallantly
corrected
himself
that
is
to
say
i
did
find
it
tiresome
for
now
you
see
it
is
different
then
with
a
stupid
and
moving
smile
célestine
monsieur
will
you
get
me
my
slippers
i
ask
your
pardon
but
monsieur
it
is
my
business
yes
to
be
sure
they
are
under
the
stairs
in
a
little
dark
closet
at
the
left
i
believe
that
i
shall
get
all
that
i
want
of
this
type
he
is
not
shrewd
he
surrenders
at
the
start
ah
one
could
lead
him
far
the
dinner
not
very
luxurious
consisting
of
the
leavings
from
the
day
before
passed
off
without
incident
almost
silently
monsieur
devours
and
madame
picks
fastidiously
at
the
dishes
with
sullen
gestures
and
disdainful
mouthings
but
she
absorbs
powders
syrups
drops
pills
an
entire
pharmacy
which
you
have
to
be
very
careful
to
place
on
the
table
at
every
meal
beside
her
plate
they
talked
very
little
and
what
they
did
say
concerned
local
matters
and
people
of
little
or
no
interest
to
me
but
i
gathered
that
they
have
very
little
company
moreover
it
was
plain
that
their
thoughts
were
not
on
what
they
were
saying
they
were
watching
me
each
according
to
the
ideas
that
prompted
him
or
her
each
moved
by
a
different
curiosity
madame
severe
and
stiff
contemptuous
even
more
and
more
hostile
and
dreaming
already
of
all
the
dirty
tricks
that
she
would
play
me
monsieur
slyly
with
very
significant
winks
and
although
he
tried
to
conceal
them
with
strange
looks
at
my
hands
really
i
do
know
what
there
is
about
my
hands
that
so
excites
men
for
my
part
i
seemed
to
be
taking
no
notice
of
their
game
i
went
and
came
with
dignity
reserved
adroit
and
distant
ah
if
they
could
have
seen
my
soul
if
they
could
have
heard
my
soul
as
i
saw
and
heard
theirs
i
adore
waiting
on
table
it
is
there
that
one
surprises
one
masters
in
all
the
filthiness
in
all
the
baseness
of
their
inner
natures
prudent
at
first
and
watchful
of
each
other
little
by
little
they
reveal
themselves
exhibit
themselves
as
they
are
without
paint
and
without
veils
forgetting
that
some
one
is
hovering
around
them
listening
and
noting
their
defects
their
moral
humps
the
secret
sores
of
their
existence
and
all
the
infamies
and
ignoble
dreams
that
can
be
contained
in
the
respectable
brains
of
respectable
people
to
collect
these
confessions
to
classify
them
to
label
them
in
our
memory
for
use
as
a
terrible
weapon
on
the
day
of
settlement
is
one
of
the
great
and
intense
joys
of
our
calling
and
the
most
precious
revenge
for
our
humiliations
from
this
first
contact
with
my
new
masters
i
have
obtained
no
precise
and
formal
indications
but
i
feel
that
things
do
not
go
well
here
that
monsieur
is
nothing
in
the
house
that
madame
is
everything
that
monsieur
trembles
before
madame
like
a
little
child
oh
he
has
a
merry
time
of
it
the
poor
man
surely
he
sees
hears
and
suffers
all
sorts
of
things
i
fancy
that
i
shall
get
some
amusement
out
of
it
at
times
at
dessert
madame
who
during
the
meal
had
been
continually
sniffing
at
my
hands
my
arms
and
my
waist
said
in
a
clear
and
cutting
tone
i
do
not
like
the
use
of
perfumes
as
i
did
not
answer
pretending
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
remark
was
addressed
to
me
she
added
do
you
hear
célestine
very
well
madame
then
i
looked
stealthily
at
poor
monsieur
who
likes
perfumes
or
who
at
least
likes
my
perfume
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
apparently
indifferent
but
really
humiliated
and
distressed
he
was
following
the
flight
of
a
wasp
which
had
been
lingering
over
a
plate
of
fruit
and
there
was
now
a
dismal
silence
in
this
which
the
twilight
had
just
invaded
and
something
inexpressibly
sad
something
unspeakably
heavy
fell
from
the
ceiling
on
these
two
beings
concerning
whom
i
really
asked
myself
of
what
use
they
are
and
what
they
are
doing
on
earth
the
lamp
célestine
it
was
madame
voice
sharper
than
ever
in
the
silence
and
the
shade
it
made
me
start
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
dark
i
should
not
have
to
ask
you
for
the
lamp
let
it
be
the
last
time
while
lighting
the
lamp
this
lamp
which
can
be
repaired
only
in
england
i
had
a
strong
desire
to
cry
out
to
poor
monsieur
just
wait
a
little
my
old
man
and
fear
nothing
and
do
distress
yourself
you
shall
eat
and
drink
the
perfumes
that
you
so
love
and
of
which
you
are
so
deprived
you
shall
breathe
them
i
promise
you
you
shall
breathe
them
in
my
hair
on
my
lips
on
my
neck
and
the
two
of
us
will
lead
this
blockhead
a
merry
dance
i
answer
for
it
and
to
emphasize
this
silent
invocation
i
took
care
as
i
placed
the
lamp
upon
the
table
to
slightly
brush
against
monsieur
arm
and
i
went
out
the
servants
hall
is
not
gay
besides
myself
there
are
only
two
domestics
a
cook
who
is
always
scolding
and
a
who
never
says
a
word
the
cook
name
is
marianne
that
of
the
joseph
stupid
peasants
and
what
heads
they
have
she
fat
soft
flabby
sprawling
a
neck
emerging
in
a
triple
cushion
from
a
dirty
neckkerchief
which
looks
as
if
she
wiped
her
kettles
with
it
two
enormous
and
shapeless
breasts
rolling
beneath
a
sort
of
blue
cotton
camisole
covered
with
grease
her
too
short
dress
disclosing
thick
ankles
and
big
feet
encased
in
grey
woolen
he
in
and
wooden
shoes
shaven
dry
nervous
with
an
evil
grimace
on
his
lips
which
stretch
from
ear
to
ear
and
a
devious
gait
the
sly
movements
of
a
sacristan
such
are
my
two
companions
no
for
the
servants
we
take
our
meals
in
the
kitchen
at
the
same
table
where
during
the
day
the
cook
does
her
dirty
work
carves
her
meats
cleans
her
fish
and
cuts
up
her
vegetables
with
fingers
fat
and
round
as
sausages
really
that
is
scarcely
proper
the
fire
in
the
stove
renders
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
stifling
odors
of
old
grease
of
rancid
sauces
of
continual
fryings
circulate
in
the
air
while
we
eat
a
kettle
in
which
the
dogs
soup
is
boiling
exhales
a
fetid
vapor
that
attacks
your
throat
and
makes
you
cough
one
almost
vomits
more
respect
is
shown
for
prisoners
in
their
cells
and
dogs
in
their
kennels
we
had
bacon
and
cabbage
and
stinking
cheese
for
drink
sour
cider
nothing
else
earthen
plates
with
cracked
enamel
and
which
smell
of
burnt
grease
and
tin
forks
complete
this
pretty
service
being
too
new
in
the
house
i
did
not
wish
to
complain
but
neither
did
i
wish
to
eat
do
further
damage
to
my
stomach
no
thank
you
why
do
you
eat
asked
the
cook
i
am
not
hungry
i
uttered
this
in
a
very
dignified
tone
then
marianne
grunted
perhaps
mademoiselle
must
have
truffles
without
showing
anger
but
with
a
stiff
and
haughty
air
i
replied
why
you
know
i
have
eaten
truffles
not
everybody
here
can
say
as
much
that
shut
her
up
meantime
the
was
filling
his
mouth
with
big
pieces
of
bacon
and
examining
me
stealthily
i
can
not
say
why
but
this
man
has
an
embarrassing
look
and
his
silence
troubles
me
although
he
is
no
longer
young
i
am
astonished
at
the
suppleness
and
elasticity
of
his
movements
the
undulations
of
his
loins
are
reptilian
let
me
describe
him
in
greater
detail
his
stiff
grizzled
hair
his
low
forehead
his
oblique
eyes
his
prominent
his
broad
strong
jaw
and
his
long
fleshy
chin
give
him
a
strange
character
that
i
can
not
define
is
he
a
simpleton
is
he
a
rascal
i
can
not
tell
yet
it
is
curious
that
this
man
holds
my
attention
as
he
does
after
a
time
this
obsession
lessens
and
disappears
and
i
realize
that
this
is
simply
another
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
tricks
of
my
excessive
magnifying
and
romantic
imagination
which
causes
me
to
see
things
and
people
as
too
beautiful
or
as
too
ugly
and
which
compels
me
to
make
of
this
miserable
joseph
a
being
superior
to
the
stupid
countryman
to
the
heavy
peasant
that
he
really
is
towards
the
end
of
the
dinner
joseph
still
without
saying
a
word
took
from
his
the
libre
parole
and
began
to
read
it
attentively
and
marianne
softened
by
having
drunk
two
full
decanters
of
cider
became
more
amiable
sprawling
on
her
chair
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
revealing
bare
arms
her
cap
set
a
little
awry
upon
her
uncombed
hair
she
asked
me
where
i
came
from
where
i
had
been
if
i
had
had
good
places
and
if
i
was
against
the
jews
and
we
talked
for
some
time
in
an
almost
friendly
way
in
my
turn
i
asked
her
for
information
concerning
the
house
whether
many
people
came
and
what
sort
of
people
whether
monsieur
was
attentive
to
the
chambermaids
whether
madame
had
a
lover
oh
but
you
should
have
seen
her
head
and
that
of
joseph
too
whose
reading
was
suddenly
interrupted
now
and
then
by
my
questions
how
scandalized
and
ridiculous
they
were
you
have
no
idea
how
far
behind
the
times
they
are
in
the
country
they
know
nothing
they
see
nothing
they
understand
nothing
the
most
natural
thing
abashes
them
and
yet
he
with
his
awkward
respectability
she
with
her
virtuous
disorder
nothing
will
get
it
out
of
my
mind
that
they
are
intimate
oh
indeed
one
must
really
be
in
a
bad
way
to
be
satisfied
with
a
type
like
that
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
come
from
paris
from
i
know
not
where
remarked
the
cook
in
a
tone
of
bitter
reproach
whereupon
joseph
with
a
toss
of
his
head
curtly
added
sure
and
he
began
to
read
the
libre
parole
again
marianne
rose
heavily
and
took
the
kettle
from
the
fire
we
talked
no
more
then
i
thought
of
my
last
place
of
monsieur
jean
the
valet
so
distinguished
with
his
black
and
his
white
skin
for
which
he
cared
as
if
he
were
a
woman
ah
he
was
such
a
handsome
fellow
monsieur
jean
so
gay
so
nice
so
delicate
so
artful
when
at
night
he
read
aloud
to
us
from
the
fin
de
siècle
or
told
us
salacious
and
touching
stories
or
familiarized
us
with
the
contents
of
monsieur
letters
things
have
changed
how
did
i
ever
come
to
get
stranded
here
among
such
people
and
far
from
everything
that
i
like
i
almost
want
to
cry
and
i
am
writing
these
lines
in
my
chamber
a
dirty
little
chamber
at
the
top
of
the
house
open
to
all
winds
to
the
winter
cold
to
the
summer
burning
heat
no
other
furniture
than
a
paltry
iron
bed
and
a
paltry
wardrobe
which
does
not
close
and
where
i
have
not
room
enough
to
arrange
my
things
no
other
light
than
a
tallow
candle
that
smokes
and
runs
down
into
a
brass
candlestick
it
is
pitiful
if
i
wish
to
continue
to
write
this
diary
or
even
to
read
the
novels
that
i
have
brought
or
to
tell
my
fortune
with
the
cards
i
shall
have
to
buy
wax
candles
with
my
own
money
for
as
for
madame
wax
candles
nit
as
monsieur
jean
would
say
they
are
under
lock
and
key
i
will
try
to
get
a
little
settled
over
my
bed
i
will
nail
my
little
gilt
crucifix
and
on
the
mantel
i
will
place
my
painted
porcelain
virgin
together
with
my
little
boxes
my
and
the
photographs
of
monsieur
jean
so
as
to
penetrate
this
hole
with
a
ray
of
privacy
and
joy
marianne
room
is
next
to
mine
a
thin
partition
separates
us
and
you
can
hear
everything
that
goes
on
i
thought
that
joseph
who
sleeps
in
the
might
visit
marianne
but
no
for
a
long
time
marianne
turned
about
in
her
room
coughing
hawking
dragging
chairs
moving
a
heap
of
things
now
she
is
snoring
it
is
doubtless
in
the
that
they
have
their
clandestine
meetings
a
dog
barks
far
away
in
the
country
it
is
nearly
two
and
my
light
is
going
out
i
too
am
obliged
to
go
to
bed
but
i
feel
that
i
shall
not
sleep
ah
how
old
i
shall
grow
in
this
hovel
yes
indeed
ii
i
have
not
yet
written
a
single
time
the
name
of
my
masters
it
is
a
ridiculous
and
comical
name
lanlaire
monsieur
and
madame
lanlaire
you
see
at
once
the
plays
that
can
be
made
on
such
a
name
and
the
jokes
to
which
it
is
bound
to
give
rise
as
for
their
christian
names
they
are
perhaps
more
ridiculous
than
their
surname
and
if
i
may
say
so
they
complete
it
that
of
monsieur
is
isidore
that
of
madame
euphrasie
euphrasie
think
of
it
i
have
just
been
to
the
haberdasher
to
match
some
silk
and
the
woman
who
keeps
the
shop
has
given
me
some
information
as
to
the
house
it
is
not
delightful
but
to
be
just
i
must
say
that
i
have
never
met
such
a
chattering
jade
if
the
dealers
of
whom
my
masters
buy
speak
in
this
way
of
them
what
must
be
said
of
them
by
those
whom
they
do
not
patronize
my
but
they
have
good
tongues
in
the
country
monsieur
father
was
a
manufacturer
of
cloths
and
a
banker
at
louviers
he
went
into
a
fraudulent
bankruptcy
that
emptied
all
the
little
purses
of
the
region
and
was
condemned
to
ten
imprisonment
which
in
view
of
the
forgeries
abuses
of
confidence
thefts
and
crimes
of
all
sorts
that
he
had
committed
was
deemed
a
very
light
sentence
while
he
was
serving
his
time
at
gaillon
he
died
but
he
had
taken
care
to
put
aside
and
in
a
safe
place
it
seems
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
which
artfully
withheld
from
the
ruined
creditors
constitute
monsieur
entire
personal
fortune
ah
you
see
it
is
no
trick
at
all
to
be
rich
madame
father
was
much
worse
although
he
was
never
sentenced
to
imprisonment
and
departed
this
life
respected
by
all
the
respectable
people
he
was
a
dealer
in
men
the
haberdasher
explained
to
me
that
under
napoleon
iii
when
everybody
was
not
obliged
to
serve
in
the
army
as
is
the
case
the
rich
young
men
who
were
drawn
by
lot
for
service
had
the
right
to
send
a
substitute
they
applied
to
an
agency
or
to
a
monsieur
who
in
consideration
of
a
premium
varying
from
one
to
two
thousand
francs
according
to
the
risks
at
the
time
found
them
a
poor
devil
who
consented
to
take
their
place
in
the
regiment
for
seven
years
and
in
case
of
war
to
die
for
them
thus
was
carried
on
in
france
the
trade
in
whites
as
in
africa
the
trade
in
blacks
there
were
like
but
for
a
more
horrible
butchery
that
does
not
greatly
astonish
me
are
there
then
none
what
i
should
like
to
know
are
the
and
the
public
houses
if
not
for
the
sale
of
human
meat
according
to
the
haberdasher
it
was
a
very
lucrative
business
and
madame
father
who
had
a
monopoly
of
it
for
the
entire
department
showed
great
skill
in
it
that
is
to
say
he
kept
for
himself
and
put
in
his
pocket
the
larger
part
of
the
premium
ten
years
ago
he
died
mayor
of
substitute
justice
of
the
peace
president
of
the
board
of
vestrymen
treasurer
of
the
charity
bureau
decorated
and
leaving
in
addition
to
the
priory
which
he
had
bought
for
nothing
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
of
which
six
hundred
thousand
went
to
madame
for
madame
has
a
brother
who
has
gone
to
the
bad
and
they
do
not
know
what
has
become
of
him
well
say
what
you
will
that
is
money
that
can
hardly
be
called
clean
if
indeed
there
be
any
clean
money
for
my
part
it
is
very
simple
i
have
seen
nothing
but
dirty
money
and
wicked
wealth
the
lanlaires
is
it
not
enough
to
disgust
you
have
then
more
then
a
million
they
do
nothing
but
economize
and
they
spend
hardly
a
third
of
their
income
curtailing
everything
depriving
others
and
themselves
haggling
bitterly
over
bills
denying
their
words
recognizing
no
agreements
save
those
that
are
written
and
signed
one
must
keep
an
eye
on
them
and
in
business
affairs
never
open
the
door
for
any
dispute
whatever
they
immediately
take
advantage
of
it
to
avoid
payment
especially
with
the
little
dealers
who
can
not
afford
the
costs
of
a
lawsuit
and
the
poor
devils
who
are
defenceless
naturally
they
never
give
anything
except
from
time
to
time
to
the
church
for
they
are
very
pious
as
for
the
poor
they
may
die
of
hunger
before
the
door
of
the
priory
imploring
and
wailing
the
door
remains
always
closed
i
even
believe
said
the
haberdasher
that
if
they
could
take
something
from
the
beggar
sack
they
would
do
it
remorselessly
with
a
savage
joy
and
she
added
by
way
of
a
monstrous
example
all
of
us
here
who
earn
our
living
with
difficulty
when
giving
hallowed
bread
buy
cake
for
the
purpose
it
is
a
point
of
propriety
and
pride
they
the
dirty
misers
they
distribute
what
bread
my
dear
young
woman
and
not
bread
at
that
not
even
white
bread
no
workman
bread
is
it
not
shameful
people
as
rich
as
they
are
why
one
day
the
wife
of
paumier
the
cooper
heard
madame
lanlaire
say
to
the
priest
who
was
mildly
reproaching
her
for
this
avarice
le
curé
that
is
always
good
enough
for
these
people
one
must
be
just
even
with
his
masters
though
there
is
only
one
voice
in
regard
to
madame
they
have
nothing
against
monsieur
they
do
not
detest
monsieur
all
agree
in
declaring
that
monsieur
is
not
proud
that
he
would
be
generous
to
people
and
would
do
much
good
if
he
could
the
trouble
is
that
he
can
not
monsieur
is
nothing
in
his
own
house
less
than
the
servants
badly
treated
as
they
are
less
than
the
cat
to
whom
everything
is
allowed
little
by
little
and
for
the
sake
of
tranquillity
he
has
abrogated
all
his
authority
as
master
of
the
house
all
his
dignity
as
a
man
into
the
hands
of
his
wife
madame
directs
regulates
organizes
administers
everything
madame
attends
to
the
stable
to
the
yard
to
the
garden
to
the
cellar
and
to
the
and
is
sure
to
find
something
amiss
everywhere
never
do
things
go
to
her
liking
and
she
continually
pretends
that
they
are
being
robbed
what
an
eye
she
has
it
is
inconceivable
they
play
her
no
tricks
be
sure
for
she
knows
them
all
she
pays
the
bills
collects
the
dividends
and
rents
and
makes
the
bargains
she
has
the
devices
of
an
old
bookkeeper
the
indelicacies
of
a
corrupt
the
ingenious
strategy
of
a
usurer
it
is
incredible
of
course
she
holds
the
purse
and
ferociously
and
she
never
loosens
the
strings
except
to
let
in
more
money
she
leaves
monsieur
without
a
sou
the
poor
man
has
hardly
enough
to
buy
his
tobacco
in
the
midst
of
his
wealth
he
is
even
more
destitute
than
the
rest
of
us
here
however
he
does
not
balk
he
never
balks
he
obeys
like
the
comrades
oh
how
queer
he
is
at
times
with
his
air
of
a
tired
and
submissive
dog
when
madame
being
out
there
comes
a
dealer
with
a
bill
a
poor
man
with
his
poverty
a
messenger
who
wants
a
tip
you
ought
to
see
monsieur
monsieur
is
really
a
comical
sight
he
fumbles
in
his
pockets
gropes
about
blushes
apologizes
and
says
with
a
sorrowful
face
why
i
have
no
change
about
me
i
have
only
bills
have
you
change
for
a
thousand
francs
no
then
you
will
have
to
call
again
bills
he
who
never
has
a
hundred
sous
about
him
even
his
madame
keeps
locked
in
a
closet
of
which
she
holds
the
key
and
she
gives
it
out
to
him
sheet
by
sheet
grumbling
thank
you
but
you
use
a
tremendous
amount
of
paper
to
whom
then
can
you
be
writing
that
you
use
so
much
the
only
thing
that
they
reproach
him
with
the
only
thing
that
they
do
not
understand
is
the
undignified
weakness
in
consequence
of
which
he
allows
himself
to
be
led
in
this
way
by
such
a
shrew
for
no
one
is
ignorant
of
the
fact
indeed
madame
shouts
it
from
the
that
monsieur
and
madame
are
no
longer
anything
to
each
other
madame
who
has
some
internal
disease
and
can
have
no
children
will
not
allow
him
to
approach
her
then
asked
the
haberdasher
in
finishing
her
conversation
why
is
monsieur
so
good
and
so
cowardly
toward
a
woman
who
denies
him
not
only
money
but
pleasure
i
would
bring
him
to
his
senses
and
rudely
too
and
this
is
what
happens
when
monsieur
who
is
a
vigorous
man
and
who
is
also
a
kindly
man
wishes
to
enjoy
himself
away
from
home
or
to
bestow
a
little
charity
upon
a
poor
man
he
is
reduced
to
ridiculous
expedients
to
clumsy
excuses
to
not
very
dignified
loans
the
discovery
of
which
by
madame
brings
on
terrible
scenes
quarrels
that
often
last
for
months
then
monsieur
is
seen
going
off
through
the
fields
walking
walking
like
a
madman
making
furious
and
threatening
gestures
crushing
the
turf
beneath
his
feet
talking
to
himself
in
the
wind
in
the
rain
in
the
snow
and
then
coming
back
at
night
more
timid
more
bowed
more
trembling
more
conquered
than
ever
the
curious
and
also
the
melancholy
part
of
the
matter
is
that
amid
the
worst
recriminations
of
the
haberdasher
among
these
unveiled
infamies
this
shameful
vileness
which
is
hawked
from
mouth
to
mouth
from
shop
to
shop
from
house
to
house
it
is
evident
that
the
jealousy
of
the
toward
the
lanlaires
is
even
greater
than
their
contempt
for
them
in
spite
of
their
criminal
uselessness
of
their
social
in
spite
of
all
that
they
crush
under
the
weight
of
their
hideous
million
this
million
none
the
less
surrounds
them
with
a
halo
of
respectability
and
almost
of
glory
the
people
bow
lower
to
them
than
to
others
and
receive
them
more
warmly
than
others
they
call
with
what
fawning
civility
the
dirty
hovel
in
which
they
live
in
the
filth
of
their
soul
the
château
to
strangers
coming
to
inquire
concerning
the
curiosities
of
the
region
i
am
sure
that
the
haberdasher
herself
hateful
though
she
is
would
answer
we
have
a
beautiful
church
a
beautiful
fountain
and
above
all
we
have
something
else
very
beautiful
the
lanlaires
who
possess
a
million
and
live
in
a
château
they
are
frightful
people
and
we
are
very
proud
of
them
the
worship
of
the
million
it
is
a
low
sentiment
common
not
only
to
the
but
to
most
of
us
also
the
little
the
humble
the
penniless
of
this
world
and
i
myself
with
my
frank
ways
and
my
threats
to
break
everything
even
i
am
not
free
from
this
i
whom
wealth
oppresses
i
who
owe
to
it
my
sorrows
my
vices
my
hatreds
the
bitterest
of
my
humiliations
and
my
impossible
dreams
and
the
perpetual
torment
of
my
life
well
as
soon
as
i
find
myself
in
presence
of
a
rich
man
i
can
not
help
looking
upon
him
as
an
exceptional
and
beautiful
being
as
a
sort
of
marvellous
divinity
and
in
spite
of
myself
surmounting
my
will
and
my
reason
i
feel
rising
from
the
depths
of
my
being
toward
this
rich
man
who
is
very
often
an
imbecile
and
sometimes
a
murderer
something
like
an
incense
of
admiration
is
it
not
stupid
and
why
why
on
leaving
this
dirty
haberdasher
and
this
strange
shop
where
by
the
way
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
match
my
silk
i
reflected
with
discouragement
upon
all
that
this
woman
had
told
me
about
my
masters
it
was
drizzling
the
sky
was
as
dirty
as
the
soul
of
this
dealer
in
pinchbeck
i
slipped
along
the
slimy
pavement
of
the
street
and
furious
against
the
haberdasher
and
against
my
masters
and
against
myself
furious
against
this
country
sky
against
this
mud
in
which
my
heart
and
my
feet
were
splashing
against
the
incurable
sadness
of
the
little
town
i
kept
on
repeating
to
myself
well
here
is
a
clean
place
for
you
i
had
seen
everything
but
this
a
nice
hole
i
have
fallen
into
ah
yes
a
nice
hole
indeed
and
here
is
something
more
madame
dresses
herself
all
alone
and
does
her
own
hair
she
locks
herself
securely
in
her
and
it
is
with
difficulty
that
i
can
obtain
an
entrance
god
knows
what
she
does
in
there
for
hours
and
hours
this
evening
unable
to
restrain
myself
i
knocked
at
the
door
squarely
and
here
is
the
little
conversation
that
ensued
between
madame
and
myself
tac
tac
who
is
there
ah
that
sharp
shrill
voice
which
one
would
like
to
force
back
into
her
throat
with
one
fist
it
is
i
madame
what
do
you
want
i
come
to
do
the
it
is
done
go
away
and
come
only
when
i
ring
for
you
that
is
to
say
that
i
am
not
even
the
chambermaid
here
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
here
and
what
my
duties
are
and
yet
to
dress
and
undress
my
mistresses
and
to
do
their
hair
is
the
only
part
of
my
work
that
i
like
i
like
to
play
with
with
dresses
and
ribbons
to
dabble
among
the
linens
the
hats
the
laces
the
furs
to
rub
my
mistresses
after
the
bath
to
powder
them
to
rub
their
feet
with
to
perfume
their
breasts
to
oxygenize
their
hair
to
know
them
in
short
from
the
tips
of
their
slippers
to
the
peak
of
their
chignon
to
see
them
all
naked
in
this
way
they
become
for
you
something
else
than
a
mistress
almost
a
friend
or
an
accomplice
often
a
slave
one
inevitably
becomes
the
confidant
of
a
heap
of
things
of
their
pains
of
their
vices
of
their
disappointments
in
love
of
the
inner
secrets
of
the
household
of
their
diseases
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
when
one
is
adroit
one
holds
them
by
a
multitude
of
details
which
they
do
not
even
suspect
one
gets
much
more
out
of
them
it
is
at
once
profitable
and
amusing
that
is
how
i
understand
the
work
of
a
chambermaid
you
can
not
imagine
how
many
there
are
how
shall
i
say
that
how
many
there
are
who
are
indecent
and
lewd
in
their
privacy
even
among
those
who
in
society
pass
for
the
most
reserved
and
the
most
strict
and
whose
virtue
is
supposed
to
be
unassailable
ah
in
the
how
the
masks
fall
how
the
proudest
fronts
crack
and
crumble
well
what
am
i
going
to
do
here
in
this
country
hole
with
an
impertinent
minx
like
my
new
mistress
i
have
no
favors
to
dream
of
no
distractions
to
hope
for
i
shall
do
stupid
housework
wearisome
sewing
and
nothing
else
ah
when
i
remember
the
places
where
i
have
served
that
makes
my
situation
still
sadder
more
intolerably
sad
and
i
have
a
great
desire
to
go
away
to
make
my
bow
once
for
all
to
this
country
of
savages
just
now
i
met
monsieur
on
the
stairs
he
was
starting
for
a
hunt
monsieur
looked
at
me
with
a
salacious
air
again
he
asked
me
well
célestine
are
you
getting
accustomed
to
the
place
decidedly
it
is
a
mania
with
him
i
answered
i
do
not
know
yet
monsieur
then
with
effrontery
and
monsieur
is
he
getting
accustomed
here
monsieur
burst
out
laughing
monsieur
takes
a
joke
well
monsieur
is
really
you
must
get
accustomed
célestine
you
must
get
accustomed
i
was
in
a
humor
for
boldness
again
i
answered
i
will
try
monsieur
with
monsieur
aid
i
think
that
monsieur
was
going
to
say
something
very
stiff
to
me
his
eyes
shone
like
two
coals
but
madame
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
monsieur
was
off
in
his
direction
i
in
mine
it
was
a
pity
this
evening
through
the
door
of
the
i
heard
madame
saying
to
monsieur
in
the
amiable
tone
that
you
can
imagine
i
wish
no
familiarity
with
my
servants
her
servants
are
not
madame
servants
monsieur
servants
well
indeed
iii
this
morning
sunday
i
went
to
mass
i
have
already
declared
that
without
being
pious
i
have
religion
all
the
same
say
and
do
what
you
like
religion
is
always
religion
the
rich
perhaps
can
get
along
without
it
but
it
is
necessary
for
people
like
us
i
know
very
well
that
there
are
individuals
who
make
use
of
it
in
a
rather
queer
fashion
that
many
priests
and
good
sisters
scarcely
do
it
honor
but
never
mind
when
one
is
unhappy
and
in
our
calling
we
get
more
than
our
share
of
unhappiness
it
is
the
only
thing
that
will
soothe
you
only
that
and
love
yes
but
love
that
is
another
sort
of
consolation
consequently
even
in
impious
houses
i
never
missed
mass
in
the
first
place
mass
is
an
excursion
a
distraction
time
gained
from
the
daily
ennui
of
the
household
and
above
all
we
meet
comrades
hear
stories
and
form
acquaintances
ah
if
on
going
out
of
the
chapel
of
the
assumptionists
i
had
wished
to
listen
to
the
old
gentlemen
who
whispered
psalms
of
a
curious
sort
in
my
ears
perhaps
i
should
not
be
here
the
weather
is
improved
there
is
a
beautiful
sun
one
of
those
misty
suns
that
make
walking
agreeable
and
sadness
less
burdensome
i
know
not
why
but
under
the
influence
of
this
blue
and
gold
morning
i
have
something
like
gaiety
in
my
heart
we
are
about
a
mile
from
the
church
the
way
leading
to
it
is
a
pleasant
one
a
little
path
winding
between
hedges
in
spring
it
must
be
full
of
flowers
wild
cherry
trees
and
the
hawthorns
that
smell
so
good
i
love
the
hawthorns
they
remind
me
of
things
when
i
was
a
little
girl
otherwise
the
country
is
like
the
country
everywhere
else
there
is
nothing
astonishing
about
it
it
is
a
very
wide
valley
and
then
yonder
at
the
end
of
the
valley
there
are
hills
in
the
valley
there
is
a
river
on
the
hills
there
is
a
forest
all
covered
with
a
veil
of
fog
transparent
and
gilded
which
hides
the
landscape
too
much
to
suit
me
oddly
enough
i
keep
my
fidelity
to
nature
as
it
is
in
brittany
i
have
it
in
my
blood
nowhere
else
does
it
seem
to
me
as
beautiful
nowhere
else
does
it
speak
better
to
my
soul
even
among
the
richest
and
most
fertile
fields
of
normandy
i
am
homesick
for
the
moors
and
for
that
tragic
and
splendid
sea
where
i
was
born
and
this
recollection
suddenly
called
up
casts
a
cloud
of
melancholy
into
the
gaiety
of
this
delightful
morning
on
the
way
i
meet
women
and
women
with
under
their
arms
they
too
are
going
to
mass
cooks
chambermaids
and
scullions
and
clumsy
and
with
the
slow
and
swaying
gait
of
animals
how
queerly
they
are
rigged
out
in
their
holiday
garb
perfect
mops
they
smell
powerfully
of
the
country
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
they
have
not
served
in
paris
they
look
at
me
with
curiosity
a
curiosity
at
once
distrustful
and
sympathetic
they
note
enviously
in
detail
my
hat
my
gown
my
little
baize
jacket
and
my
umbrella
rolled
in
its
green
silk
cover
my
costume
that
of
a
lady
astonishes
them
and
especially
i
think
my
coquettish
and
smart
way
of
wearing
it
they
nudge
each
other
with
their
elbows
make
enormous
eyes
and
open
their
mouths
immoderately
to
show
each
other
my
luxury
and
my
style
and
i
go
tripping
along
nimbly
and
lightly
with
my
pointed
shoes
and
boldly
lifting
up
my
dress
which
makes
a
sound
of
rustling
silk
against
the
skirts
beneath
what
can
you
expect
for
my
part
i
am
glad
to
be
admired
as
they
pass
by
me
i
hear
them
say
to
each
other
in
a
whisper
that
is
the
new
chambermaid
at
the
priory
one
of
them
short
fat
asthmatic
and
who
seems
to
have
great
difficulty
in
carrying
an
immense
paunch
on
legs
widely
spread
apart
undoubtedly
to
the
better
steady
it
approaches
me
with
a
smile
a
thick
glutinous
smile
on
her
gluttonous
lips
you
are
the
new
chambermaid
at
the
priory
your
name
is
célestine
you
arrived
from
paris
four
days
ago
she
knows
everything
already
she
is
familiar
with
everything
and
with
me
and
there
is
nothing
about
this
paunchy
body
about
this
walking
goatskin
that
so
amuses
me
as
the
musketeer
hat
a
large
black
felt
hat
whose
plumes
sway
in
the
breeze
she
continues
my
name
is
rose
rose
i
am
at
mauger
the
next
place
to
yours
he
is
a
former
captain
perhaps
you
have
already
seen
him
no
mademoiselle
you
might
have
seen
him
over
the
hedge
that
separates
the
two
estates
he
is
always
working
in
the
garden
he
is
still
a
fine
man
you
know
we
walk
more
slowly
for
rose
is
almost
stifling
she
wheezes
like
a
foundered
mare
with
every
breath
her
chest
expands
and
contracts
then
to
expand
again
she
says
chopping
her
words
i
have
one
of
my
attacks
oh
how
people
suffer
these
days
it
is
incredible
then
between
wheezes
and
hiccoughs
she
encourages
me
you
must
come
and
see
me
my
little
one
if
you
need
anything
good
advice
no
matter
what
do
not
hesitate
i
am
fond
of
young
people
we
will
drink
a
little
glass
of
peach
brandy
as
we
talk
many
of
these
young
women
come
to
our
house
she
stops
a
moment
takes
breath
and
then
in
a
lower
voice
and
a
confidential
tone
continues
and
say
mademoiselle
célestine
if
you
wish
to
have
your
letters
addressed
in
our
care
it
would
be
more
prudent
a
bit
of
good
advice
that
i
give
you
madame
lanlaire
reads
the
letters
all
the
letters
once
she
came
very
near
being
sentenced
for
it
by
the
justice
of
the
peace
i
repeat
do
not
hesitate
i
thank
her
and
we
continue
to
walk
although
her
body
pitches
and
rolls
like
an
old
vessel
in
a
heavy
sea
mademoiselle
rose
seems
now
to
breathe
more
easily
and
we
go
on
gossiping
oh
it
will
be
a
change
for
you
here
surely
in
the
first
place
my
little
one
at
the
priory
they
never
keep
a
chambermaid
for
any
length
of
time
that
is
a
settled
matter
when
madame
does
not
discharge
them
monsieur
gets
them
into
trouble
a
terrible
man
monsieur
lanlaire
the
pretty
the
ugly
the
young
the
old
all
are
alike
to
him
oh
the
house
is
well
known
and
everybody
will
tell
you
what
i
tell
you
you
are
there
you
have
no
liberty
you
are
crushed
with
work
and
chiding
and
scolding
all
the
time
a
real
hell
one
needs
only
to
see
you
pretty
and
well
brought
up
as
you
are
to
know
beyond
a
doubt
that
you
are
not
made
to
stay
with
such
curmudgeons
all
that
the
haberdasher
told
me
mademoiselle
rose
tells
me
again
with
more
disagreeable
variations
so
violent
is
this
woman
passion
for
chattering
that
she
finally
forgets
her
suffering
her
malice
gets
the
better
of
her
asthma
and
the
scandal
of
the
house
goes
its
course
mingled
with
the
private
affairs
of
the
neighborhood
although
already
i
know
them
all
rose
stories
are
so
black
and
her
words
are
so
discouraging
that
again
i
am
thoroughly
saddened
i
ask
myself
if
i
had
not
better
go
away
at
once
why
try
an
experiment
in
which
i
am
conquered
in
advance
other
women
have
overtaken
us
curious
nosy
accompanying
with
an
energetic
for
sure
each
of
the
revelations
of
rose
who
less
and
less
winded
continues
to
jabber
mauger
is
a
very
good
man
and
all
alone
my
little
one
as
much
as
to
say
that
i
am
the
mistress
why
a
former
captain
it
is
natural
is
it
he
is
no
manager
he
knows
nothing
of
household
affairs
he
likes
to
be
taken
care
of
and
coddled
have
his
linen
well
kept
his
caprices
respected
nice
dishes
prepared
for
him
if
he
had
not
beside
him
a
person
in
whom
he
had
confidence
he
would
be
plundered
right
and
left
my
god
there
is
no
lack
of
thieves
here
the
intonation
of
her
spasmodic
utterances
and
her
winks
clearly
revealed
to
me
her
exact
situation
in
captain
mauger
house
why
you
know
a
man
all
alone
and
who
still
has
ideas
and
besides
there
is
work
to
do
all
the
same
and
we
are
going
to
hire
a
boy
to
assist
this
rose
is
lucky
i
too
have
often
dreamed
of
entering
an
old
service
it
is
disgusting
but
at
least
one
is
tranquil
and
has
a
future
we
traverse
the
entire
district
oh
indeed
it
is
not
pretty
it
in
no
way
resembles
the
boulevard
malesherbes
dirty
narrow
winding
streets
and
houses
that
stand
neither
square
or
straight
dark
houses
of
old
rotten
wood
with
high
tottering
gables
and
bulging
stories
that
project
one
past
the
other
in
the
olden
fashion
the
people
who
pass
are
ugly
ugly
and
i
have
not
seen
a
single
handsome
fellow
the
industry
of
the
neighborhood
is
the
manufacture
of
most
of
the
shoemakers
having
been
unable
to
deliver
a
week
product
at
the
factory
are
still
at
work
and
behind
the
i
see
poor
sickly
faces
bent
backs
and
black
hands
hammering
leather
soles
that
adds
still
further
to
the
dismal
sadness
of
the
place
it
seems
like
a
prison
but
here
is
the
haberdasher
who
standing
at
her
threshold
smiles
at
us
and
bows
you
are
going
to
eight
mass
i
went
to
seven
mass
you
have
plenty
of
time
will
you
not
come
in
a
moment
rose
thanks
her
she
warns
me
against
the
haberdasher
who
is
a
malicious
woman
and
speaks
ill
of
everybody
a
real
pest
then
she
begins
again
to
boast
of
her
master
virtues
and
of
her
easy
place
i
ask
her
then
the
captain
has
no
family
no
family
she
cries
scandalized
well
my
little
one
you
are
not
on
oh
yes
there
is
a
family
and
a
nice
one
indeed
heaps
of
nieces
and
cousins
loafers
penniless
people
all
of
whom
were
plundering
him
and
robbing
him
you
should
have
seen
that
it
was
an
abomination
so
you
can
imagine
whether
i
set
that
right
i
cleared
the
house
of
all
this
vermin
why
my
dear
young
woman
but
for
me
the
captain
now
would
be
on
his
uppers
ah
the
poor
man
he
is
well
satisfied
with
the
way
things
are
now
i
insist
with
an
ironical
intention
which
however
she
does
not
understand
and
undoubtedly
mademoiselle
rose
he
will
remember
you
in
his
will
prudently
she
replies
monsieur
will
do
as
he
likes
he
is
free
surely
i
do
not
influence
him
i
ask
nothing
of
him
i
do
not
ask
him
even
to
pay
me
wages
i
stay
with
him
out
of
devotion
but
he
knows
life
he
knows
those
who
love
him
who
care
for
him
with
disinterestedness
who
coddle
him
no
one
need
think
that
he
is
stupid
as
certain
persons
pretend
madame
lanlaire
at
the
head
who
says
things
about
us
it
is
she
on
the
contrary
who
is
mademoiselle
célestine
and
who
has
a
will
of
her
own
depend
upon
it
upon
this
eloquent
apology
for
the
captain
we
arrive
at
the
church
the
fat
rose
does
not
leave
me
she
obliges
me
to
take
a
chair
near
hers
and
begins
to
mumble
prayers
to
make
genuflections
and
signs
of
the
cross
oh
this
church
with
its
rough
timbers
that
cross
it
and
sustain
the
staggering
vault
it
resembles
a
barn
with
the
people
in
it
coughing
hawking
running
against
benches
and
dragging
chairs
around
it
seems
also
like
a
village
i
see
nothing
but
faces
stupefied
by
ignorance
bitter
mouths
contracted
by
hatred
there
are
none
here
but
wretched
creatures
who
come
to
ask
god
to
do
something
against
somebody
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
concentrate
my
thoughts
and
i
feel
a
sort
of
cold
penetrating
me
and
surrounding
me
perhaps
it
is
because
there
is
not
even
an
organ
in
this
church
queer
it
but
i
can
not
pray
without
an
organ
an
anthem
on
the
organ
fills
my
chest
and
then
my
stomach
it
completely
restores
me
like
love
if
i
could
always
hear
the
strains
of
an
organ
i
really
believe
that
i
should
never
sin
here
instead
of
an
organ
there
is
an
old
woman
in
the
choir
with
blue
spectacles
and
a
poor
little
black
shawl
over
her
shoulders
who
painfully
drums
on
a
sort
of
piano
wheezy
and
out
of
tune
and
the
people
are
always
coughing
and
hawking
the
droning
of
the
priest
and
the
responses
of
the
choristers
being
drowned
by
a
sound
of
catarrh
and
how
bad
it
all
smells
mingled
odors
of
the
of
the
stable
of
the
soil
of
sour
straw
of
wet
leather
of
damaged
incense
really
they
are
very
in
the
country
the
mass
drags
along
and
i
grow
weary
i
am
especially
vexed
at
finding
myself
among
people
so
ordinary
and
so
ugly
and
who
pay
so
little
attention
to
me
not
a
pretty
spectacle
not
a
pretty
costume
with
which
to
rest
my
thought
or
cheer
my
eyes
never
did
i
better
understand
that
i
am
made
for
the
joy
of
elegance
and
style
instead
of
being
lifted
up
as
at
mass
in
paris
all
my
senses
take
offence
and
rebel
at
once
for
distraction
i
follow
attentively
the
movements
of
the
officiating
priest
oh
thank
you
he
is
a
sort
of
tall
jovial
fellow
very
young
with
an
ordinary
face
and
a
complexion
with
his
dishevelled
hair
his
greedy
jaw
his
gluttonous
lips
his
obscene
little
eyes
and
his
eyelids
circled
with
black
i
have
sized
him
up
at
once
how
he
must
enjoy
himself
at
the
table
and
at
the
confessional
too
the
dirty
things
that
he
must
say
rose
perceiving
that
i
am
watching
him
bends
toward
me
and
says
in
a
very
low
voice
that
is
the
new
vicar
i
recommend
him
to
you
there
is
no
one
like
him
to
confess
the
women
the
curate
is
a
holy
man
certainly
but
he
is
looked
upon
as
too
strict
whereas
the
new
vicar
she
clacks
her
tongue
and
goes
back
to
her
prayer
her
head
bent
over
the
well
he
would
not
please
me
the
new
vicar
he
has
a
dirty
and
brutal
air
he
looks
more
like
a
ploughman
than
a
priest
for
my
part
i
require
delicacy
poetry
the
beyond
and
white
hands
i
like
men
to
be
gentle
and
as
monsieur
jean
was
after
mass
rose
drags
me
to
the
grocery
store
with
a
few
mysterious
words
she
explains
to
me
that
it
is
necessary
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
woman
who
keeps
it
and
that
all
the
domestics
pay
her
assiduous
court
another
little
dump
decidedly
this
is
the
country
of
fat
women
her
face
is
covered
with
freckles
and
through
her
thin
light
flaxen
hair
which
is
lacking
in
gloss
can
be
seen
portions
of
her
skull
on
top
of
which
a
chignon
stands
up
in
a
ridiculous
fashion
like
a
little
broom
at
the
slightest
movement
her
breast
beneath
her
brown
cloth
waist
shakes
like
a
liquid
in
a
bottle
her
eyes
bordered
with
red
circles
are
bloodshot
and
her
ignoble
mouth
makes
of
her
every
smile
a
grimace
rose
introduces
me
madame
gouin
i
bring
you
the
new
chambermaid
at
the
priory
the
grocer
observes
me
attentively
and
i
notice
that
her
eyes
fasten
themselves
upon
my
waist
with
an
embarrassing
obstinacy
she
says
in
a
meaningless
voice
mademoiselle
is
at
home
here
mademoiselle
is
a
pretty
girl
mademoiselle
is
a
parisienne
undoubtedly
it
is
true
madame
gouin
i
come
from
paris
that
is
to
be
seen
that
is
to
be
seen
directly
one
need
not
look
at
you
twice
i
am
very
fond
of
the
parisiennes
they
know
what
it
is
to
live
i
too
served
in
paris
when
i
was
young
i
served
in
the
house
of
a
midwife
in
the
rue
guénégaud
madame
tripier
perhaps
you
know
her
no
that
makes
no
difference
oh
it
was
a
long
time
ago
but
come
in
mademoiselle
célestine
she
escorts
us
with
ceremony
into
the
back
shop
where
four
other
domestics
are
already
gathered
about
a
round
table
oh
you
will
have
an
anxious
time
of
it
my
poor
young
woman
groaned
the
grocer
as
she
offered
me
a
chair
it
is
not
because
they
do
not
patronize
me
at
the
château
but
i
can
truly
say
that
it
is
an
infernal
house
infernal
is
it
not
so
mesdemoiselles
for
sure
answer
in
chorus
with
like
gestures
and
like
grimaces
the
four
domestics
thus
appealed
to
madame
gouin
continues
oh
thank
you
i
would
not
like
to
sell
to
people
who
are
continually
haggling
and
crying
out
like
that
they
are
being
robbed
that
they
are
being
injured
they
may
go
where
they
like
the
chorus
of
servants
responds
surely
they
may
go
where
they
like
to
which
madame
gouin
addressing
rose
more
particularly
adds
in
a
firm
tone
they
do
not
run
after
them
do
they
rose
thank
god
we
have
no
need
of
them
do
we
rose
contents
herself
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
putting
into
this
gesture
all
the
concentrated
gall
spite
and
contempt
at
her
command
and
the
huge
musketeer
hat
emphasizes
the
energy
of
these
violent
sentiments
by
the
disorderly
swaying
of
its
black
plumes
then
after
a
silence
oh
well
let
us
talk
no
more
about
these
people
every
time
that
i
speak
of
them
it
turns
my
stomach
thereupon
the
stories
and
gossip
begin
again
an
uninterrupted
flow
of
filth
is
vomited
from
these
sad
mouths
as
from
a
sewer
the
seems
infected
with
it
the
impression
is
the
more
disagreeable
because
the
room
is
rather
dark
and
the
faces
take
on
fantastic
deformities
it
is
lighted
only
by
a
narrow
window
opening
on
a
damp
and
filthy
court
a
sort
of
shaft
formed
by
walls
an
odor
of
pickle
of
rotting
vegetables
of
red
herring
persists
around
us
impregnating
our
garments
it
is
intolerable
then
each
of
these
creatures
heaped
up
on
their
chairs
like
bundles
of
dirty
linen
plunges
into
the
narration
of
some
dirty
action
some
scandal
some
crime
coward
that
i
am
i
try
to
smile
with
them
to
applaud
with
them
but
i
feel
something
insurmountable
something
like
frightful
disgust
a
nausea
turns
my
stomach
forces
its
way
to
my
throat
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
and
presses
my
temples
i
should
like
to
go
away
i
can
not
and
i
remain
there
like
an
idiot
heaped
up
like
them
on
my
chair
making
the
same
gestures
that
they
make
i
remain
there
stupidly
listening
to
these
shrill
voices
that
sound
to
me
like
gurgling
and
dripping
through
sinks
and
pipes
i
know
very
well
that
we
have
to
defend
ourselves
against
our
masters
and
i
am
not
the
last
to
do
it
i
assure
you
but
no
here
all
the
same
that
passes
imagination
these
women
are
odious
to
me
i
detest
them
and
i
say
to
myself
in
a
low
voice
that
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
them
education
contact
with
stylish
people
the
habit
of
seeing
beautiful
things
the
reading
of
paul
bourget
novels
have
saved
me
from
these
turpitudes
ah
the
pretty
and
amusing
of
the
servants
halls
in
paris
they
are
far
away
as
we
are
leaving
the
grocer
says
to
me
with
an
amiable
smile
pay
no
attention
to
the
fact
that
your
masters
do
not
patronize
me
you
must
come
and
see
me
again
i
go
back
with
rose
who
finishes
familiarizing
me
with
the
daily
doings
of
the
neighborhood
i
had
supposed
that
her
stock
of
infamies
was
exhausted
not
at
all
she
discovers
and
invents
new
and
more
frightful
ones
in
the
matter
of
calumny
her
resources
are
infinite
and
her
tongue
goes
on
forever
without
stopping
it
does
not
forget
anybody
or
anything
it
is
astonishing
how
in
a
few
minutes
one
can
dishonor
people
in
the
country
thus
she
escorts
me
back
to
the
priory
gate
even
there
she
can
not
make
up
her
mind
to
leave
me
talks
on
talks
incessantly
tries
to
envelop
and
stun
me
with
her
friendship
and
devotion
as
for
me
my
head
is
broken
by
all
that
i
have
heard
and
the
sight
of
the
priory
fills
me
with
a
feeling
of
discouragement
ah
these
broad
flowerless
lawns
and
this
immense
building
that
has
the
air
of
a
barrack
or
a
prison
and
where
from
behind
each
window
a
pair
of
eyes
seems
to
be
spying
you
the
sun
is
warmer
the
fog
has
disappeared
and
the
view
of
the
landscape
has
become
clearer
beyond
the
plain
on
the
hills
i
perceive
little
villages
gilded
by
the
light
and
enlivened
by
red
roofs
the
river
running
through
the
plain
yellow
and
green
shines
here
and
there
in
silvery
curves
and
a
few
clouds
decorate
the
sky
with
their
light
and
charming
frescoes
but
i
take
no
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
all
this
i
have
now
but
one
desire
one
will
one
obsession
to
flee
from
this
sun
from
this
plain
from
these
hills
from
this
house
and
from
this
fat
woman
whose
malicious
voice
hurts
and
tortures
me
at
last
she
gets
ready
to
leave
me
takes
my
hand
and
presses
it
affectionately
in
her
fat
fingers
gloved
with
mittens
she
says
to
me
and
then
my
little
one
madame
gouin
you
know
is
a
very
amiable
and
very
clever
woman
you
must
go
to
see
her
often
she
lingers
longer
and
adds
more
mysteriously
she
has
relieved
many
young
girls
as
soon
as
they
are
in
any
trouble
they
go
to
her
neither
seen
or
known
one
can
trust
her
take
my
word
for
it
she
is
a
very
very
expert
woman
with
eyes
more
brilliant
and
fastening
her
gaze
on
me
with
a
strange
tenacity
she
repeats
very
expert
and
clever
and
discreet
she
is
the
providence
of
the
neighborhood
now
my
little
one
do
not
forget
to
come
to
see
us
when
you
can
and
go
often
to
madame
gouin
you
will
not
regret
it
we
will
see
each
other
soon
again
she
has
gone
i
see
her
with
her
rolling
gait
moving
away
skirting
first
the
wall
and
then
the
hedge
with
her
enormous
person
and
suddenly
burying
herself
in
a
road
where
she
disappears
i
pass
by
joseph
the
who
is
raking
the
paths
i
think
that
he
is
going
to
speak
to
me
he
does
not
speak
to
me
he
simply
looks
at
me
obliquely
with
a
singular
expression
that
almost
frightens
me
fine
weather
this
morning
monsieur
joseph
joseph
grunts
i
know
not
what
between
his
teeth
he
is
furious
that
i
have
allowed
myself
to
walk
in
the
path
that
he
is
raking
what
a
queer
man
he
is
and
how
and
why
does
he
never
say
a
word
to
me
and
why
does
he
never
answer
when
i
speak
to
him
in
the
house
i
find
madame
by
no
means
contented
she
gives
me
a
very
disagreeable
reception
treats
me
very
roughly
i
beg
you
not
to
stay
out
so
long
in
future
i
desire
to
reply
for
i
am
vexed
irritated
unnerved
but
fortunately
i
restrain
myself
i
confine
myself
to
muttering
a
little
what
that
you
say
i
say
nothing
it
is
lucky
and
furthermore
i
forbid
you
to
walk
with
servant
she
is
very
bad
company
for
you
see
everything
is
late
this
morning
because
of
you
i
say
to
myself
zut
and
you
make
me
tired
i
will
speak
to
whom
i
like
i
will
see
anyone
that
it
pleases
me
to
see
you
shall
lay
down
no
law
for
me
camel
i
need
only
to
see
once
more
her
wicked
eyes
and
hear
her
shrill
voice
and
her
tyrannical
orders
in
order
to
lose
at
once
the
bad
impression
the
impression
of
disgust
that
i
brought
back
from
the
mass
from
the
grocer
and
from
rose
rose
and
the
grocer
are
right
the
haberdasher
also
is
right
all
of
them
are
right
and
i
promise
myself
that
i
will
see
rose
that
i
will
see
her
often
that
i
will
return
to
the
grocer
that
i
will
make
this
dirty
haberdasher
my
best
friend
since
madame
forbids
me
to
do
so
and
i
repeat
internally
with
savage
energy
camel
camel
camel
but
i
would
have
been
much
more
relieved
if
i
had
had
the
courage
to
hurl
and
shout
this
insult
full
in
her
face
during
the
day
after
lunch
monsieur
and
madame
went
out
driving
the
the
chambers
monsieur
desk
all
the
closets
all
the
cupboards
all
the
sideboards
were
locked
what
did
i
tell
you
ah
well
thank
you
no
means
of
reading
a
letter
or
of
making
up
any
little
packages
so
i
have
remained
in
my
room
i
have
written
to
my
mother
and
to
monsieur
jean
and
i
have
read
en
famille
what
a
delightful
book
and
how
well
written
it
is
queer
all
the
same
i
am
very
fond
of
hearing
dirty
things
but
i
do
not
like
to
read
them
i
like
only
the
books
that
make
me
cry
for
dinner
they
had
boiled
beef
and
broth
it
seemed
to
me
that
monsieur
and
madame
were
very
cool
toward
each
other
monsieur
read
the
petit
journal
with
provoking
ostentation
he
crumpled
the
paper
rolling
all
the
time
his
kind
comical
gentle
eyes
even
when
he
is
in
anger
monsieur
eyes
remain
gentle
and
timid
at
last
doubtless
to
start
the
conversation
monsieur
with
his
nose
still
buried
in
his
paper
exclaimed
hello
another
woman
cut
to
pieces
madame
made
no
answer
very
stiff
very
straight
austere
in
her
black
silk
dress
her
forehead
wrinkled
her
look
stern
she
did
not
cease
her
dreaming
about
what
it
is
perhaps
because
of
me
that
madame
is
sulky
with
monsieur
iv
for
a
week
i
have
been
unable
to
write
a
single
line
in
my
diary
when
it
comes
night
i
am
tired
exhausted
at
the
end
of
my
strength
i
think
of
nothing
but
going
to
bed
and
to
sleep
to
sleep
if
i
could
always
sleep
oh
what
a
shabby
place
my
god
you
can
have
no
idea
of
it
for
a
yes
for
a
no
madame
makes
you
run
up
and
down
the
two
cursed
flights
of
stairs
one
has
not
even
time
to
sit
down
in
the
and
breathe
a
little
when
drinn
drinn
drinn
one
has
to
get
up
and
start
again
it
makes
no
difference
if
one
is
not
feeling
well
drinn
drinn
drinn
in
these
days
i
have
pains
in
my
loins
that
bend
me
in
two
and
gripe
my
stomach
and
almost
make
me
cry
out
that
cuts
no
figure
drinn
drinn
drinn
one
has
no
time
to
be
sick
one
has
not
the
right
to
suffer
suffering
is
a
master
luxury
we
we
must
walk
and
fast
and
forever
walk
at
the
risk
of
falling
drinn
drinn
drinn
and
if
one
is
a
little
slow
in
coming
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
then
there
are
reproaches
and
angry
scenes
well
what
are
you
about
you
do
not
hear
then
are
you
deaf
i
have
been
ringing
for
three
hours
it
is
getting
to
be
very
provoking
and
this
is
what
generally
happens
drinn
drinn
drinn
that
throws
you
from
your
chair
as
if
impelled
by
a
spring
bring
me
a
needle
i
go
for
the
needle
all
right
bring
me
some
thread
i
go
for
the
thread
very
good
bring
me
a
button
i
go
for
the
button
what
is
this
button
i
did
not
ask
for
this
button
you
never
understand
anything
a
white
button
number
four
and
be
quick
about
it
and
i
go
for
the
white
button
number
four
you
can
imagine
how
i
storm
and
rage
and
abuse
madame
within
myself
during
these
goings
and
comings
these
ascents
and
descents
madame
has
changed
her
mind
she
wants
something
else
or
she
wants
nothing
at
all
no
take
away
the
needle
and
the
button
i
have
no
time
my
back
is
broken
my
knees
absolutely
stiff
i
can
do
no
more
that
suffices
for
madame
she
is
satisfied
and
to
think
that
there
is
a
society
for
the
protection
of
animals
in
the
evening
when
making
her
examination
of
the
she
storms
what
you
have
done
nothing
what
do
you
do
all
day
long
then
i
do
not
pay
you
to
be
idle
from
morning
till
night
i
reply
rather
curtly
for
this
injustice
fills
me
with
rebellion
why
madame
has
been
interrupting
me
all
day
i
have
been
interrupting
you
i
in
the
first
place
i
forbid
you
to
answer
me
i
want
no
remarks
do
you
understand
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
and
she
goes
away
slamming
the
door
and
grumbling
as
if
she
would
never
stop
in
the
corridors
in
the
kitchen
in
the
garden
her
shrill
voice
can
be
heard
for
hours
oh
how
tiresome
she
is
really
one
knows
not
how
to
take
her
what
can
she
have
in
her
body
that
keeps
her
always
in
such
a
state
of
irritation
and
how
quickly
i
would
drop
her
if
i
were
sure
of
finding
a
place
directly
just
now
i
was
suffering
even
more
than
usual
i
felt
so
sharp
a
pain
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
beast
were
tearing
the
interior
of
my
body
with
its
teeth
and
claws
already
in
the
morning
on
rising
i
had
fainted
because
of
loss
of
blood
how
have
i
had
the
courage
to
keep
up
and
drag
myself
about
and
do
my
work
i
do
not
know
occasionally
on
the
stairs
i
was
obliged
to
stop
and
cling
to
the
banister
in
order
to
get
my
breath
and
keep
from
falling
i
was
green
with
cold
sweats
that
wet
my
hair
it
was
enough
to
make
one
scream
but
i
am
good
at
bearing
pain
and
it
is
a
matter
of
pride
with
me
never
to
complain
in
presence
of
my
masters
madame
surprised
me
at
a
moment
when
i
thought
that
i
was
about
to
faint
everything
was
revolving
about
me
the
banister
the
stairs
and
the
walls
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
said
to
me
rudely
nothing
and
i
tried
to
straighten
up
if
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
you
rejoined
madame
why
these
manners
i
do
not
like
to
see
funereal
faces
you
have
a
very
disagreeable
way
of
doing
your
work
in
spite
of
my
pain
i
could
have
boxed
her
ears
amid
these
trials
i
am
always
thinking
of
my
former
places
it
is
my
place
in
the
rue
lincoln
that
i
most
regret
there
i
was
second
chambermaid
and
had
so
to
speak
nothing
to
do
we
passed
the
day
in
the
a
magnificent
with
a
red
felt
carpet
and
lined
from
ceiling
to
floor
with
great
mahogany
cupboards
with
gilded
locks
and
we
laughed
and
we
amused
ourselves
in
talking
nonsense
in
reading
in
mimicking
madame
receptions
all
under
the
eye
of
an
english
governess
who
made
tea
for
us
the
good
tea
that
madame
bought
in
england
for
her
little
morning
breakfasts
sometimes
from
the
servants
hall
the
butler
one
who
was
up
to
date
brought
us
cakes
caviare
on
toast
slices
of
ham
and
a
heap
of
good
things
i
remember
that
one
afternoon
they
obliged
me
to
put
on
a
very
swell
costume
belonging
to
monsieur
to
coco
as
we
called
him
among
ourselves
naturally
we
played
at
all
sorts
of
games
we
even
went
very
far
in
our
ah
that
was
a
place
i
am
beginning
to
know
monsieur
well
they
were
right
in
saying
that
he
is
an
excellent
and
generous
man
for
if
he
were
not
there
would
not
be
in
the
world
a
worse
rascal
a
more
perfect
sharper
the
need
the
passion
that
he
feels
for
being
charitable
impel
him
to
do
things
that
are
not
very
admirable
his
intention
is
praiseworthy
but
the
result
upon
others
is
often
disastrous
all
the
same
it
must
be
confessed
that
his
kindness
has
been
the
cause
of
dirty
little
tricks
like
the
following
last
tuesday
a
very
simple
old
man
father
pantois
brought
some
that
monsieur
had
ordered
of
course
without
knowledge
it
was
toward
the
end
of
the
day
i
had
come
down
for
some
hot
water
for
a
belated
bath
madame
who
had
gone
to
town
had
not
yet
returned
and
i
was
chattering
in
the
kitchen
with
marianne
when
monsieur
cordial
joyous
unreserved
and
noisy
brought
in
father
pantois
he
immediately
had
him
served
with
bread
cheese
and
cider
and
then
he
began
to
talk
with
him
the
good
man
excited
my
pity
so
worn
thin
and
dirtily
clad
was
he
his
pantaloons
were
in
rags
his
cap
was
a
mass
of
filth
and
his
open
shirt
revealed
a
part
of
his
bare
breast
chapped
crimped
seasoned
like
old
leather
he
ate
greedily
well
father
pantois
cried
monsieur
rubbing
his
hands
that
goes
better
eh
the
old
man
with
his
mouth
full
thanked
him
you
are
very
good
monsieur
lanlaire
because
you
see
since
this
morning
at
four
when
i
left
home
i
have
put
nothing
in
my
stomach
nothing
at
all
well
eat
away
father
pantois
regale
yourself
while
you
are
about
it
you
are
very
good
monsieur
lanlaire
pray
excuse
me
the
old
man
cut
off
enormous
pieces
of
bread
which
he
was
a
long
time
in
chewing
for
he
had
no
teeth
left
when
he
was
partially
satisfied
monsieur
asked
him
and
the
father
pantois
they
are
fine
this
year
eh
there
are
some
that
are
fine
there
are
some
that
are
not
so
fine
there
are
almost
all
sorts
monsieur
lanlaire
indeed
one
can
scarcely
choose
and
they
are
hard
to
pull
up
you
can
believe
and
besides
monsieur
porcellet
will
not
let
us
take
them
from
his
woods
any
more
we
have
to
go
a
long
way
now
to
find
them
a
very
long
way
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
come
from
the
forest
of
raillon
more
than
three
leagues
from
here
yes
indeed
monsieur
lanlaire
while
the
good
man
was
talking
monsieur
had
taken
a
seat
at
the
table
beside
him
gay
almost
uproarious
he
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
exclaimed
five
leagues
you
are
a
jolly
good
one
father
pantois
always
strong
always
young
not
so
much
as
that
monsieur
lanlaire
not
so
much
as
that
nonsense
insisted
monsieur
strong
as
an
old
turk
and
yes
indeed
they
do
make
any
more
like
you
these
days
father
pantois
you
are
of
the
old
school
you
are
the
old
man
shook
his
head
his
gaunt
head
of
the
color
of
old
wood
and
repeated
not
so
much
as
that
my
legs
are
weakening
monsieur
lanlaire
my
arms
are
getting
soft
and
then
my
back
oh
my
confounded
back
my
strength
is
almost
gone
and
then
the
wife
who
is
sick
and
who
never
leaves
her
bed
what
a
bill
for
medicines
one
has
little
luck
one
has
little
luck
if
at
least
one
did
not
grow
old
that
you
see
monsieur
lanlaire
that
is
the
worst
of
the
matter
monsieur
sighed
made
a
vague
gesture
and
then
summing
up
the
question
philosophically
said
oh
yes
but
what
do
you
expect
father
pantois
such
is
life
one
can
not
be
and
have
been
that
the
way
it
is
to
be
sure
one
must
be
reasonable
that
it
we
live
while
we
can
is
it
so
monsieur
lanlaire
indeed
it
is
and
after
a
pause
he
added
in
a
voice
that
had
become
melancholy
besides
everybody
has
his
sorrows
father
pantois
no
doubt
of
it
there
was
a
silence
marianne
was
cutting
up
herbs
it
was
growing
dark
in
the
garden
the
two
big
sunflowers
which
could
be
seen
in
the
perspective
of
the
open
door
were
losing
their
color
and
disappearing
in
the
shade
and
father
pantois
kept
on
eating
his
glass
had
remained
empty
monsieur
filled
it
and
then
suddenly
abandoning
his
metaphysical
heights
he
asked
and
what
are
worth
this
year
monsieur
lanlaire
well
this
year
taking
them
as
they
come
are
worth
francs
a
hundred
it
is
a
little
dear
i
know
but
i
can
not
get
them
for
less
really
i
can
not
like
a
generous
man
who
despises
considerations
of
money
monsieur
interrupted
the
old
man
who
was
getting
ready
to
justify
himself
by
explanations
it
is
all
right
father
pantois
it
is
agreed
do
i
ever
haggle
with
you
in
fact
instead
of
francs
i
will
pay
you
for
your
ah
monsieur
lanlaire
you
are
too
good
no
no
i
am
just
i
am
for
the
people
i
am
for
labor
do
you
know
and
with
a
blow
on
the
table
he
went
higher
still
no
not
thirty
father
pantois
i
will
pay
you
thirty
francs
do
you
hear
that
the
good
man
lifted
his
poor
eyes
to
monsieur
in
astonishment
and
gratitude
and
stammered
i
hear
very
well
it
is
a
pleasure
to
work
for
you
monsieur
lanlaire
you
know
what
work
is
you
do
monsieur
put
an
end
to
these
effusions
and
i
will
go
to
pay
you
let
us
see
is
tuesday
i
will
go
to
pay
you
on
sunday
does
that
suit
you
and
at
the
same
time
i
will
take
my
gun
is
it
agreed
the
gleam
of
gratitude
which
had
been
shining
in
the
eyes
of
father
pantois
faded
out
he
was
embarrassed
troubled
he
stopped
eating
you
see
said
he
timidly
well
in
short
if
you
could
pay
it
that
would
oblige
me
greatly
monsieur
lanlaire
francs
that
all
pray
excuse
me
you
are
joking
father
pantois
replied
monsieur
with
superb
assurance
certainly
i
will
pay
you
that
directly
i
proposed
that
only
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
little
trip
and
paying
you
a
little
visit
he
fumbled
in
the
pockets
of
his
pantaloons
then
in
those
of
his
vest
and
waistcoat
and
assuming
an
air
of
surprise
he
cried
well
there
here
i
am
again
without
change
i
have
nothing
but
confounded
bills
with
a
forced
and
really
sinister
laugh
he
asked
i
will
bet
that
you
have
not
change
for
a
thousand
francs
father
pantois
seeing
monsieur
laugh
father
pantois
thought
that
it
was
proper
for
him
to
laugh
too
and
he
answered
jovially
ha
ha
ha
i
have
never
even
seen
these
confounded
bills
well
on
sunday
then
concluded
monsieur
monsieur
had
poured
out
a
glass
of
cider
for
himself
and
was
drinking
with
father
pantois
when
madame
whom
they
had
not
heard
coming
suddenly
entered
the
kitchen
like
a
gust
of
wind
ah
her
eye
when
she
saw
that
when
she
saw
monsieur
sitting
at
table
beside
the
poor
old
man
and
drinking
with
him
what
this
she
exclaimed
her
lips
all
white
monsieur
stammered
and
hemmed
and
hawed
it
is
some
you
know
very
well
my
pet
some
father
pantois
has
brought
me
some
all
the
were
frozen
this
winter
i
have
ordered
no
we
need
no
here
this
was
said
in
a
cutting
tone
then
she
made
a
of
the
room
and
went
out
slamming
the
door
and
showering
insults
in
her
anger
she
had
not
noticed
me
monsieur
and
the
poor
old
puller
of
had
risen
embarrassed
they
looked
at
the
door
through
which
madame
had
just
disappeared
then
they
looked
at
each
other
without
daring
to
say
a
word
monsieur
was
the
first
to
break
this
painful
silence
well
then
on
sunday
father
pantois
on
sunday
monsieur
lanlaire
and
take
good
care
of
yourself
father
pantois
you
also
monsieur
lanlaire
and
thirty
francs
mind
you
i
do
not
take
back
what
i
said
you
are
very
good
and
the
old
man
trembling
on
his
legs
and
with
back
bent
went
away
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
poor
monsieur
he
must
have
received
his
lecture
and
as
for
father
pantois
if
ever
he
gets
his
thirty
francs
well
he
will
be
lucky
i
do
not
wish
to
justify
madame
but
i
think
that
monsieur
is
wrong
in
talking
familiarly
with
people
that
are
too
far
beneath
him
it
is
not
dignified
i
know
very
well
that
he
does
lead
a
gay
life
to
be
sure
and
that
he
takes
such
opportunities
as
offer
that
is
not
always
convenient
when
he
comes
back
late
from
a
hunt
dirty
and
wet
and
singing
to
keep
up
his
courage
madame
gives
him
a
warm
reception
ah
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
leave
me
alone
all
day
but
you
know
very
well
my
pet
be
still
she
sulks
for
hours
and
hours
her
forehead
stern
her
mouth
ugly
he
follows
her
about
everywhere
trembling
and
stammering
excuses
but
my
pet
you
know
very
well
let
me
alone
you
make
me
tired
the
next
day
naturally
monsieur
does
not
go
out
and
madame
exclaims
why
do
you
wander
about
thus
in
the
house
like
a
soul
in
torment
but
my
pet
you
would
do
much
better
to
go
out
to
go
hunting
the
devil
knows
where
you
annoy
me
you
unnerve
me
go
away
so
that
he
never
knows
what
to
do
whether
to
go
or
stay
to
be
here
or
elsewhere
a
difficult
problem
but
as
in
either
case
madame
scolds
monsieur
has
taken
the
course
of
going
away
as
often
as
possible
in
that
way
he
does
not
hear
her
scold
ah
it
is
really
pitiful
the
other
morning
as
i
was
going
to
spread
a
little
linen
on
the
hedge
i
saw
him
in
the
garden
monsieur
was
gardening
the
wind
having
blown
down
some
dahlias
during
the
night
he
was
refastening
them
to
their
props
very
often
when
he
does
not
go
out
before
lunch
monsieur
works
in
the
garden
at
least
he
pretends
to
be
occupying
himself
with
something
or
other
in
his
platbands
it
is
always
time
gained
from
the
ennui
of
the
household
during
these
moments
there
are
no
scenes
away
from
madame
he
is
no
longer
the
same
man
his
face
lightens
up
his
eyes
shine
naturally
gay
his
gaiety
comes
to
the
surface
really
he
is
not
disagreeable
in
the
house
indeed
he
rarely
speaks
to
me
now
and
though
still
bent
on
his
idea
seems
to
pay
no
attention
to
me
but
outside
he
never
fails
to
address
me
a
pleasant
little
word
after
making
sure
however
that
madame
can
not
be
spying
him
when
he
does
not
dare
to
speak
to
me
he
looks
at
me
and
his
look
is
more
eloquent
than
his
words
moreover
i
amuse
myself
in
exciting
him
in
all
ways
although
i
have
taken
no
resolution
concerning
him
in
passing
by
him
in
the
path
where
he
was
working
bent
over
his
dahlias
with
bits
of
string
between
his
teeth
i
said
to
him
without
slackening
my
pace
oh
how
hard
monsieur
is
working
this
morning
yes
indeed
he
answered
these
confounded
dahlias
you
see
he
invited
me
to
stop
a
minute
well
célestine
i
hope
you
are
getting
accustomed
to
the
place
now
always
his
mania
always
the
same
difficulty
in
engaging
in
conversation
to
please
him
i
replied
with
a
smile
why
yes
monsieur
certainly
i
am
getting
accustomed
here
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
it
is
not
bad
here
really
it
is
not
bad
he
quite
straightened
up
gave
me
a
very
tender
look
and
repeated
it
is
not
bad
thus
giving
himself
time
to
think
of
something
ingenious
to
say
to
me
he
took
from
his
teeth
the
bits
of
string
tied
them
at
the
top
of
the
prop
and
with
legs
spread
apart
and
his
two
palms
resting
on
his
hips
with
a
knowing
look
and
frankly
obscene
eyes
he
cried
i
bet
célestine
that
you
led
a
gay
life
in
paris
say
now
did
you
i
was
not
expecting
this
and
i
had
a
great
desire
to
laugh
but
i
lowered
my
eyes
modestly
with
an
offended
air
and
trying
to
blush
as
was
proper
under
the
circumstances
i
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
reproach
oh
monsieur
well
what
he
insisted
a
pretty
girl
like
you
with
such
eyes
oh
yes
you
must
have
had
a
gay
time
and
so
much
the
better
for
my
part
i
am
for
amusement
yes
i
am
for
love
monsieur
was
becoming
strangely
animated
and
on
his
robust
muscular
person
i
recognized
the
most
evident
signs
of
amorous
exaltation
he
was
on
fire
desire
was
flaming
in
his
eyes
i
deemed
it
my
duty
to
pour
a
good
shower
of
cold
water
on
this
fire
in
a
very
dry
tone
and
at
the
same
time
very
loftily
i
said
monsieur
is
mistaken
monsieur
thinks
that
he
is
speaking
to
his
other
chambermaids
monsieur
must
know
however
that
i
am
a
good
girl
and
with
great
dignity
to
show
exactly
to
what
extent
this
outrage
had
offended
me
i
added
it
will
serve
monsieur
right
if
i
go
to
complain
to
madame
directly
and
i
made
a
pretence
of
starting
monsieur
quickly
grasped
me
by
the
arm
no
no
he
stammered
how
did
i
ever
say
all
that
without
bursting
how
did
i
ever
succeed
in
burying
in
my
throat
the
laugh
that
was
ringing
there
really
i
know
monsieur
was
prodigiously
ridiculous
livid
now
with
mouth
wide
open
his
whole
person
bearing
a
expression
of
annoyance
and
fear
he
remained
silent
digging
into
his
neck
with
his
nails
near
us
an
old
pear
tree
twisted
its
pyramid
of
branches
eaten
by
lichens
and
mosses
a
few
pears
hung
within
reach
of
his
hand
a
magpie
was
chattering
ironically
at
the
top
of
a
neighboring
chestnut
tree
crouching
behind
the
border
of
box
the
cat
was
pawing
at
a
the
silence
was
becoming
more
and
more
painful
for
monsieur
at
last
after
efforts
that
were
almost
sorrowful
efforts
that
brought
grotesque
grimaces
to
his
lips
monsieur
asked
do
you
like
pears
célestine
yes
monsieur
i
did
not
disarm
i
answered
in
a
tone
of
lofty
indifference
in
the
fear
of
being
surprised
by
his
wife
he
hesitated
a
few
seconds
and
suddenly
like
a
thieving
child
he
took
a
pear
from
the
tree
and
gave
it
to
me
oh
how
piteously
his
knees
bent
his
hand
trembled
there
célestine
hide
that
in
your
apron
you
never
have
any
in
the
kitchen
do
you
no
monsieur
well
i
will
give
you
some
occasionally
because
because
i
wish
you
to
be
happy
the
sincerity
and
ardor
of
his
desire
his
awkwardness
his
clumsy
gestures
his
bewildered
words
and
also
his
masculine
power
all
had
a
softening
effect
upon
me
i
relaxed
my
face
a
little
veiled
the
severity
of
my
look
with
a
sort
of
smile
and
half
ironically
half
coaxingly
i
said
to
him
oh
monsieur
if
madame
were
to
see
you
again
he
became
troubled
but
as
we
were
separated
from
the
house
by
a
thick
curtain
of
chestnut
trees
he
quickly
recovered
himself
and
growing
more
defiant
as
i
became
less
severe
he
exclaimed
with
easy
gestures
well
what
madame
and
what
of
her
i
care
nothing
for
madame
i
do
not
intend
that
she
shall
annoy
me
i
have
enough
of
her
i
am
over
my
head
in
madame
i
declared
gravely
monsieur
is
wrong
monsieur
is
not
just
madame
is
a
very
amiable
woman
he
gave
a
start
very
amiable
she
ah
great
god
but
you
do
not
know
then
what
she
has
done
she
has
spoiled
my
life
i
am
no
longer
a
man
i
am
nothing
at
all
i
am
the
of
the
neighborhood
and
all
on
account
of
my
wife
my
wife
she
she
she
is
a
hussy
yes
célestine
a
hussy
a
hussy
a
hussy
i
gave
him
a
moral
lecture
i
talked
to
him
gently
hypocritically
boasting
of
madame
energy
and
order
and
all
her
domestic
virtues
at
each
of
my
phrases
he
became
more
exasperated
no
no
a
hussy
a
hussy
however
i
succeeded
in
calming
him
a
little
poor
monsieur
i
played
with
him
with
marvelous
ease
with
a
simple
look
i
made
him
pass
from
anger
to
emotion
then
he
stammered
oh
you
are
so
gentle
you
are
you
are
so
pretty
you
must
be
so
good
whereas
that
hussy
oh
come
monsieur
come
come
he
continued
you
are
so
gentle
and
yet
what
you
are
only
a
chambermaid
for
a
moment
he
drew
nearer
to
me
and
in
a
low
voice
said
if
you
would
célestine
if
i
would
what
if
you
would
you
know
very
well
yes
you
know
very
well
monsieur
wishes
me
perhaps
to
betray
madame
with
monsieur
he
misunderstood
the
expression
of
my
face
and
with
eyes
standing
out
of
his
head
the
veins
in
his
neck
swollen
his
lips
moist
and
frothy
he
answered
in
a
smothered
voice
yes
yes
indeed
monsieur
does
think
of
such
a
thing
i
think
of
nothing
else
célestine
he
was
very
red
his
face
congested
ah
monsieur
is
going
to
begin
again
he
tried
to
grasp
my
hand
to
draw
me
to
him
well
yes
he
stammered
i
am
going
to
begin
again
i
am
going
to
begin
again
because
because
i
am
mad
over
you
célestine
because
i
think
of
nothing
else
because
i
can
not
sleep
because
i
feel
really
sick
and
do
be
afraid
of
me
have
no
fears
i
am
not
a
brute
no
indeed
i
swear
it
i
i
another
word
monsieur
and
this
time
i
tell
everything
to
madame
suppose
some
one
were
to
see
you
in
the
garden
in
this
condition
he
stopped
short
distressed
ashamed
thoroughly
stupid
he
knew
not
what
to
do
with
his
hands
with
his
eyes
with
his
whole
person
and
he
looked
without
seeing
them
at
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
at
the
old
pear
tree
at
the
garden
conquered
at
last
he
untied
the
bits
of
string
at
the
top
of
the
prop
bent
again
over
the
fallen
dahlias
and
sad
infinitely
so
and
supplicating
he
groaned
just
now
célestine
i
said
to
you
i
said
that
to
you
as
i
would
have
said
anything
else
to
you
as
i
would
have
said
no
matter
what
i
am
an
old
fool
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
and
above
all
you
must
not
say
anything
to
madame
you
are
right
though
suppose
some
one
had
seen
us
in
the
garden
i
ran
away
to
keep
from
laughing
yes
i
wanted
to
laugh
and
nevertheless
there
was
an
emotion
singing
in
my
heart
something
what
shall
i
call
it
something
maternal
and
besides
it
would
have
been
amusing
because
of
madame
we
shall
see
later
monsieur
did
not
go
away
all
day
he
straightened
his
dahlias
and
during
the
afternoon
he
did
not
leave
the
where
he
split
wood
furiously
for
more
than
four
hours
from
the
i
listened
with
a
sort
of
pride
to
the
blows
of
the
axe
yesterday
monsieur
and
madame
spent
the
entire
afternoon
at
louviers
monsieur
had
an
appointment
with
his
lawyer
madame
with
her
dressmaker
her
dressmaker
i
took
advantage
of
this
moment
of
rest
to
pay
a
visit
to
rose
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
that
famous
sunday
and
i
was
not
averse
to
making
the
acquaintance
of
captain
mauger
a
true
type
of
an
old
this
man
and
such
as
you
seldom
see
i
assure
you
fancy
a
carp
head
with
a
moustache
and
a
long
gray
tuft
of
beard
very
dry
very
nervous
very
restless
he
can
not
stay
in
one
place
for
any
length
of
time
and
is
always
at
work
either
in
his
garden
or
in
a
little
room
where
he
does
carpentering
humming
military
airs
or
imitating
the
bugle
of
the
regiment
the
garden
is
very
pretty
an
old
garden
divided
into
square
beds
in
which
flowers
are
cultivated
those
very
old
flowers
that
are
found
now
only
in
very
old
fields
and
in
the
gardens
of
very
old
priests
when
i
arrived
rose
comfortably
seated
in
the
shade
of
an
acacia
beside
a
rustic
table
on
which
lay
her
was
mending
stockings
and
the
captain
squatting
on
the
grass
and
wearing
an
old
on
his
head
was
stopping
the
leaks
in
a
which
had
burst
the
night
before
they
welcomed
me
enthusiastically
and
rose
ordered
the
little
servant
who
was
weeding
a
bed
of
marguerites
to
go
for
the
bottle
of
peach
brandy
and
some
glasses
the
first
courtesies
exchanged
the
captain
asked
well
he
has
not
yet
croaked
then
your
lanlaire
oh
you
can
boast
of
serving
in
a
famous
den
i
really
pity
you
my
dear
young
woman
he
explained
to
me
that
formerly
monsieur
and
he
had
lived
as
good
neighbors
as
inseparable
friends
a
discussion
apropos
of
rose
had
brought
on
a
deadly
quarrel
monsieur
it
seems
reproached
the
captain
with
not
maintaining
his
dignity
with
his
servant
with
admitting
her
to
his
table
interrupting
his
story
the
captain
forced
my
testimony
to
my
table
well
have
i
not
the
right
is
it
any
of
his
business
certainly
not
captain
rose
in
a
modest
voice
sighed
a
man
living
all
alone
it
is
very
natural
is
it
since
this
famous
discussion
which
had
come
near
ending
in
blows
the
two
old
friends
had
passed
their
time
in
lawsuits
and
tricks
they
hated
each
other
savagely
as
for
me
declared
the
captain
when
i
find
any
stones
in
my
garden
i
throw
them
over
the
hedge
into
lanlaire
so
much
the
worse
if
they
fall
on
his
and
on
his
or
rather
so
much
the
better
oh
the
pig
wait
now
let
me
show
you
having
noticed
a
stone
in
the
path
he
rushed
to
pick
it
up
approached
the
hedge
cautiously
creeping
like
a
trapper
and
threw
the
stone
into
our
garden
with
all
his
might
we
heard
a
noise
of
breaking
glass
then
returning
to
us
triumphantly
shaking
stifled
twisted
with
laughter
he
exclaimed
another
square
broken
the
glazier
will
have
to
come
again
rose
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
maternal
admiration
and
said
is
he
not
droll
what
a
child
and
how
young
for
his
age
after
we
had
sipped
a
little
glass
of
brandy
captain
mauger
desired
to
do
me
the
honors
of
the
garden
rose
excused
herself
for
her
inability
to
accompany
us
because
of
her
asthma
and
counselled
us
not
to
stay
too
long
besides
said
she
jokingly
i
am
watching
you
the
captain
took
me
through
the
paths
among
the
beds
bordered
with
box
and
filled
with
flowers
he
told
me
the
names
of
the
prettiest
ones
remarking
each
time
that
there
were
no
such
to
be
seen
in
the
garden
of
that
pig
of
a
lanlaire
suddenly
he
plucked
a
little
flower
odd
and
charming
twirled
the
stem
gently
in
his
fingers
and
asked
me
did
you
ever
eat
any
of
these
i
was
so
surprised
by
this
preposterous
question
that
i
stood
with
mouth
closed
the
captain
declared
well
i
have
eaten
them
they
are
perfect
to
the
taste
i
have
eaten
all
the
flowers
that
are
here
some
are
good
some
are
not
so
good
and
some
do
amount
to
much
but
as
for
me
i
eat
everything
he
winked
clacked
his
tongue
tapped
his
belly
and
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
in
which
an
accent
of
defiance
was
uppermost
i
eat
everything
i
do
the
way
in
which
the
captain
had
just
proclaimed
this
strange
confession
of
faith
revealed
to
me
that
his
vanity
in
life
was
to
eat
everything
i
amused
myself
in
humoring
his
mania
and
you
are
right
captain
surely
he
answered
not
without
pride
and
it
is
not
only
plants
that
i
eat
i
eat
animals
also
animals
that
nobody
else
has
eaten
animals
that
are
not
known
i
eat
everything
i
do
we
continued
our
walk
among
the
through
the
narrow
paths
where
pretty
corollas
blue
yellow
and
red
were
swaying
in
the
breeze
and
as
he
looked
at
the
flowers
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
captain
belly
gave
little
starts
of
joy
his
tongue
passed
over
his
chapped
lips
with
a
slight
smack
he
said
to
me
further
and
i
am
going
to
confess
to
you
there
are
no
insects
no
birds
no
that
i
have
not
eaten
i
have
eaten
skunks
and
snakes
rats
and
crickets
and
caterpillars
i
have
eaten
everything
it
is
well
known
in
the
neighborhood
when
they
find
a
beast
dead
or
alive
a
beast
unknown
to
anybody
they
say
to
themselves
must
take
it
to
captain
mauger
they
bring
it
to
me
and
i
eat
it
in
winter
especially
when
it
is
very
cold
unknown
birds
pass
this
way
coming
from
america
or
from
a
greater
distance
perhaps
they
bring
them
to
me
and
i
eat
them
i
will
bet
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
world
who
has
eaten
as
many
things
as
i
have
i
eat
everything
the
walk
over
we
returned
to
sit
down
under
the
acacia
and
i
was
getting
ready
to
leave
when
the
captain
cried
oh
i
must
show
you
something
curious
something
that
you
have
never
seen
i
am
sure
and
he
called
in
a
loud
voice
kléber
kléber
between
two
calls
he
explained
to
me
kléber
is
my
ferret
a
phenomenon
and
he
called
again
kléber
kléber
then
on
a
branch
above
us
between
green
and
golden
leaves
there
appeared
a
pink
snout
and
two
little
black
sharp
bright
eyes
oh
i
knew
well
that
he
was
not
far
away
come
come
here
kléber
psstt
the
animal
crept
along
the
branch
ventured
upon
the
trunk
and
descended
carefully
burying
its
claws
in
the
bark
his
body
covered
with
white
fur
and
marked
with
pale
yellow
spots
had
the
supple
movements
the
graceful
undulations
of
a
serpent
he
touched
ground
and
in
two
bounds
was
on
the
knees
of
the
captain
who
began
to
caress
him
joyfully
oh
the
good
kléber
oh
the
charming
little
kléber
he
turned
to
me
did
you
ever
see
a
ferret
as
tame
as
that
he
follows
me
about
the
garden
everywhere
like
a
little
dog
i
have
only
to
call
him
and
he
is
there
directly
his
tail
frisking
his
head
lifted
he
eats
with
us
sleeps
with
us
indeed
i
love
the
little
beast
as
if
he
were
a
person
why
mademoiselle
célestine
i
have
refused
three
hundred
francs
for
him
i
would
not
sell
him
for
a
thousand
francs
no
not
for
two
thousand
francs
here
kléber
the
animal
lifted
its
head
toward
its
master
then
it
climbed
upon
him
mounted
his
shoulders
and
after
a
thousand
caresses
and
a
thousand
pretty
tricks
rolled
itself
around
the
captain
neck
like
a
handkerchief
rose
said
nothing
she
seemed
vexed
then
an
infernal
idea
flashed
into
my
mind
i
will
bet
you
i
said
suddenly
i
will
bet
you
captain
that
you
would
not
eat
your
ferret
the
captain
looked
at
me
with
profound
astonishment
and
then
with
infinite
sadness
his
eyes
became
round
his
lips
quivered
kléber
he
stammered
eat
kléber
evidently
this
question
had
never
occurred
to
him
who
had
eaten
everything
a
sort
of
new
world
strangely
comestible
appeared
before
him
i
will
bet
i
repeated
ferociously
that
you
would
not
eat
your
ferret
bewildered
distressed
moved
by
a
mysterious
and
invincible
shock
the
old
captain
had
risen
from
his
bench
he
was
extraordinarily
agitated
just
say
that
again
and
see
he
stammered
for
the
third
time
violently
separating
each
word
i
said
i
will
bet
that
you
would
not
eat
your
ferret
i
would
not
eat
my
ferret
what
that
you
say
you
say
that
i
would
not
eat
it
yes
you
say
that
well
you
shall
see
i
tell
you
that
i
eat
everything
he
seized
the
ferret
as
one
breaks
a
loaf
of
bread
he
broke
the
little
beast
back
with
a
snap
and
threw
it
dead
without
a
shock
without
a
spasm
on
the
sandy
path
shouting
to
rose
make
me
a
stew
out
of
that
for
dinner
and
madly
gesticulating
he
ran
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
house
for
some
minutes
i
felt
a
real
and
unspeakable
horror
still
completely
dazed
by
the
abominable
action
that
i
had
just
committed
i
rose
to
go
i
was
very
pale
rose
accompanied
me
with
a
smile
she
confided
to
me
i
am
not
sorry
for
what
has
just
happened
he
was
too
fond
of
his
ferret
i
do
not
wish
him
to
love
anything
he
loves
his
flowers
already
too
much
to
suit
me
after
a
short
silence
she
added
but
he
will
never
forgive
you
for
that
he
is
not
a
man
to
be
defied
an
old
soldier
you
know
then
a
few
steps
farther
on
pay
attention
my
little
one
they
are
beginning
to
gossip
about
you
in
the
neighborhood
it
seems
that
you
were
seen
the
other
day
in
the
garden
with
monsieur
lanlaire
it
is
very
imprudent
believe
me
he
will
get
you
into
trouble
if
he
has
already
done
so
you
want
to
look
out
for
yourself
and
as
she
closed
the
gate
behind
me
well
revoir
now
i
must
go
to
make
my
stew
all
day
long
i
saw
before
my
eyes
the
body
of
the
poor
little
ferret
lying
there
on
the
sandy
path
this
evening
at
dinner
when
dessert
was
being
served
madame
said
to
me
very
severely
if
you
like
prunes
you
have
only
to
ask
me
for
them
i
will
see
if
i
can
give
you
any
but
i
forbid
you
to
take
them
i
answered
i
am
not
a
thief
madame
and
i
do
not
like
prunes
madame
insisted
i
tell
you
that
you
have
taken
some
prunes
i
replied
if
madame
thinks
me
a
thief
madame
has
only
to
pay
me
and
let
me
go
madame
snatched
the
plate
of
prunes
from
my
hand
monsieur
ate
five
this
morning
there
were
now
there
are
but
then
you
have
taken
two
do
let
that
happen
again
it
was
true
i
had
eaten
two
of
them
she
had
counted
them
did
you
ever
in
your
life
v
my
mother
is
dead
i
received
the
news
this
morning
in
a
letter
from
home
although
i
have
never
had
anything
but
blows
from
her
the
news
has
given
me
pain
and
i
have
cried
and
cried
and
cried
seeing
me
crying
madame
said
again
these
manners
i
answered
my
mother
my
poor
mother
is
dead
then
madame
in
her
ordinary
voice
it
is
a
pity
but
i
can
do
nothing
about
it
at
any
rate
the
work
must
not
suffer
and
that
was
all
oh
indeed
madame
kindness
will
never
kill
her
what
has
made
me
most
unhappy
is
the
fact
that
i
have
seen
a
coincidence
between
my
mother
death
and
the
murder
of
the
little
ferret
it
seems
to
me
like
a
punishment
from
heaven
and
that
perhaps
my
mother
would
not
be
dead
if
i
had
not
obliged
the
captain
to
kill
poor
kléber
in
vain
have
i
repeated
to
myself
that
my
mother
died
before
the
ferret
that
had
no
effect
the
idea
has
pursued
me
all
day
long
like
a
remorse
i
should
have
liked
to
go
home
but
audierne
is
so
far
away
at
the
end
of
the
world
it
seems
and
i
have
no
money
when
i
shall
receive
my
first
month
wages
i
shall
have
to
pay
the
i
shall
not
have
enough
to
even
pay
the
few
little
debts
contracted
during
the
days
when
i
was
on
the
pavement
and
then
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
go
my
brother
is
in
the
naval
service
and
his
vessel
is
in
china
i
believe
for
it
is
a
very
long
time
since
we
had
any
news
from
him
and
my
sister
louise
where
is
she
now
i
do
not
know
since
she
left
us
to
follow
jean
le
duff
to
concarneau
nothing
has
been
heard
from
her
she
must
have
rolled
hither
and
thither
the
devil
knows
where
perhaps
she
is
in
a
public
house
perhaps
she
too
is
dead
and
perhaps
also
my
brother
is
dead
yes
why
should
i
go
there
in
what
way
would
it
help
me
there
is
no
one
there
now
who
interests
me
and
surely
my
mother
has
left
nothing
her
rags
and
the
little
furniture
that
she
had
certainly
will
not
pay
her
brandy
bill
it
is
queer
all
the
same
as
long
as
she
was
living
i
almost
never
thought
of
her
i
felt
no
desire
to
see
her
again
i
wrote
to
her
only
when
i
changed
my
place
and
then
simply
to
give
her
my
address
she
has
beaten
me
so
much
i
was
so
unhappy
with
her
she
being
always
drunk
and
yet
on
learning
suddenly
that
she
is
dead
my
soul
is
plunged
in
mourning
and
i
feel
more
alone
than
ever
and
i
remember
my
childhood
with
singular
clearness
i
see
again
all
the
things
and
beings
among
whom
i
began
the
stern
apprenticeship
of
life
there
is
really
too
much
sorrow
on
one
side
too
much
happiness
on
the
other
the
world
is
not
just
one
night
i
remember
i
was
very
small
moreover
i
remember
that
we
were
awakened
with
a
start
by
the
whistle
of
the
boat
oh
those
calls
in
the
tempest
and
in
the
darkness
how
lugubrious
they
are
since
the
night
before
the
wind
had
been
blowing
a
gale
the
harbor
bar
was
white
and
furious
only
a
few
sloops
had
been
able
to
get
back
the
others
the
poor
others
were
surely
in
danger
knowing
that
my
father
was
fishing
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ile
de
sein
my
mother
was
not
too
anxious
she
hoped
that
he
had
put
into
the
island
harbor
as
he
had
done
so
often
before
nevertheless
on
hearing
the
whistle
of
the
boat
she
arose
trembling
and
very
pale
wrapped
me
hurriedly
in
a
thick
woolen
shawl
and
started
for
the
breakwater
my
sister
louise
who
was
already
grown
and
my
younger
brother
followed
her
crying
oh
holy
virgin
oh
our
jesus
and
she
too
cried
oh
holy
virgin
oh
our
jesus
the
narrow
streets
were
full
of
people
women
old
men
children
a
crowd
of
frightened
shadows
were
hastening
to
the
pier
where
the
groaning
of
the
boats
could
be
heard
but
they
could
not
stay
on
the
breakwater
because
of
the
strong
wind
and
especially
because
of
the
waves
which
beating
against
the
stone
embankment
swept
it
from
end
to
end
with
the
noise
of
a
cannonade
my
mother
took
the
path
oh
holy
virgin
oh
our
jesus
took
the
path
that
winds
around
the
estuary
to
the
everything
was
black
on
land
and
on
the
sea
which
was
black
also
could
be
seen
from
time
to
time
in
the
distance
by
the
rays
from
the
the
white
breaking
of
enormous
waves
in
spite
of
the
shocks
oh
holy
virgin
oh
our
jesus
in
spite
of
the
shocks
and
in
a
way
lulled
by
them
in
spite
of
the
wind
and
in
a
way
stunned
by
it
i
went
to
sleep
in
my
mother
arms
i
awoke
in
a
low
room
and
i
saw
among
sombre
backs
gloomy
faces
and
waving
arms
i
saw
on
a
camp
bed
lighted
by
two
tallow
candles
a
great
corpse
oh
holy
virgin
oh
our
jesus
a
frightful
corpse
long
and
naked
perfectly
rigid
the
face
crushed
the
limbs
streaked
with
bleeding
gashes
and
covered
with
black
and
blue
spots
it
was
my
father
i
see
him
still
his
hair
was
glued
to
his
skull
and
filled
with
a
mass
of
that
made
a
sort
of
crown
men
were
bending
over
him
rubbing
his
skin
with
warm
flannels
and
forcing
air
into
his
mouth
there
was
the
mayor
there
was
the
rector
there
was
the
captain
of
customs
there
was
the
marine
policeman
i
was
frightened
i
freed
myself
from
my
shawl
and
running
between
the
legs
of
these
men
over
the
wet
stone
floor
i
began
to
cry
to
call
papa
to
call
mamma
a
neighbor
took
me
away
from
that
moment
my
mother
took
to
drinking
furiously
at
first
she
really
tried
to
work
in
the
establishments
but
as
she
was
always
drunk
none
of
her
employers
would
keep
her
then
she
stayed
at
home
to
intoxicate
herself
quarrelsome
and
gloomy
and
when
she
was
full
of
brandy
she
beat
us
how
does
it
happen
that
she
did
not
kill
me
i
avoided
the
house
as
much
as
i
could
i
spent
my
days
in
playing
on
the
pier
in
thieving
in
the
gardens
and
in
paddling
in
the
puddles
when
the
tide
was
low
or
else
on
the
plogoff
road
at
the
bottom
of
a
grassy
decline
sheltered
from
the
sea
wind
and
covered
with
thick
bushes
i
misbehaved
with
the
little
boys
among
the
hawthorns
on
returning
at
night
i
generally
found
my
mother
stretched
on
the
tile
floor
across
the
threshold
inert
her
mouth
covered
with
vomit
and
a
broken
bottle
in
her
hands
often
i
had
to
step
over
her
body
her
awakenings
were
terrible
she
was
seized
with
a
passion
for
destruction
without
listening
to
my
prayers
or
my
cries
she
tore
me
from
the
bed
pursued
me
kicked
me
and
knocked
me
against
the
furniture
crying
i
have
your
hide
i
have
your
hide
many
times
i
thought
i
should
die
and
then
she
debauched
herself
to
get
money
with
which
to
buy
liquor
at
night
every
night
low
knocks
were
heard
at
the
door
of
our
house
a
sailor
entered
filling
the
room
with
a
strong
odor
of
and
fish
he
lay
down
remained
an
hour
and
went
away
and
another
came
after
him
lay
down
also
remained
another
hour
and
went
away
there
were
struggles
and
terrifying
uproars
in
the
darkness
of
these
abominable
nights
and
several
times
the
police
interfered
thus
years
rolled
by
i
was
not
wanted
anywhere
nor
was
my
sister
or
my
brother
they
avoided
us
in
the
streets
the
respectable
people
drove
us
with
stones
from
their
houses
to
which
we
went
sometimes
to
steal
sometimes
to
beg
one
day
my
sister
louise
who
also
had
got
into
bad
ways
with
the
sailors
ran
away
and
then
my
brother
enlisted
as
a
i
was
left
alone
with
my
mother
at
the
age
of
ten
i
was
no
longer
chaste
made
familiar
with
love
by
the
sad
example
of
mamma
perverted
by
the
little
boys
with
whom
i
associated
my
physical
development
had
been
very
rapid
in
spite
of
deprivations
and
blows
living
continually
in
the
open
sea
air
free
and
strong
i
had
grown
so
fast
that
at
the
age
of
eleven
i
experienced
the
first
awakenings
of
womanhood
beneath
my
girlish
exterior
i
was
almost
a
woman
at
the
age
of
twelve
i
was
a
woman
quite
and
no
longer
a
virgin
raped
no
not
exactly
consenting
yes
almost
at
least
in
the
degree
in
which
the
artlessness
of
my
vice
and
the
candor
of
my
depravity
were
consistent
with
consent
the
thing
occurred
one
sunday
after
high
mass
near
the
beach
on
the
saint
jean
side
in
a
recess
in
the
cliff
in
a
dark
hole
among
the
rocks
where
the
came
to
build
their
nests
and
where
the
sailors
sometimes
hid
the
wreckage
which
they
found
at
sea
the
man
was
the
foreman
of
a
establishment
an
old
hairy
man
whose
face
was
nothing
but
a
dirty
mass
of
beard
and
hair
he
gave
me
an
orange
he
had
a
funny
name
cléophas
biscouille
and
here
is
an
incomprehensible
thing
of
which
i
have
found
no
explanation
in
any
novel
ugly
brutal
and
repulsive
though
biscouille
was
when
i
think
of
him
now
and
i
often
do
how
happens
it
that
it
is
never
with
a
feeling
of
detestation
for
him
never
with
a
disposition
to
curse
him
at
this
recollection
which
i
call
up
with
satisfaction
i
feel
a
sort
of
great
gratitude
a
sort
of
great
tenderness
and
also
a
sort
of
real
regret
at
having
to
say
to
myself
that
never
shall
i
see
this
disgusting
personage
again
in
this
connection
may
i
be
permitted
to
offer
here
humble
though
i
am
my
personal
contribution
to
the
biography
of
great
men
paul
bourget
was
the
intimate
friend
and
spiritual
guide
of
the
countess
fardin
in
whose
house
last
year
i
served
as
chambermaid
i
had
always
heard
it
said
that
he
alone
knew
even
to
its
subsoil
the
complex
soul
of
woman
and
many
times
i
had
had
the
idea
of
writing
to
him
in
order
to
submit
to
him
this
case
of
passional
psychology
i
had
not
dared
do
not
be
too
much
astonished
at
the
gravity
of
such
preoccupations
they
are
not
usual
among
domestics
i
admit
but
in
the
of
the
countess
they
never
talked
of
anything
but
psychology
it
is
an
admitted
fact
that
our
mind
is
modeled
on
that
of
our
masters
and
that
what
is
said
in
the
is
said
also
in
the
servants
hall
unhappily
we
had
not
in
the
servants
hall
a
paul
bourget
capable
of
elucidating
and
solving
the
cases
of
feminism
that
we
discussed
there
the
explanations
of
monsieur
jean
himself
were
not
satisfactory
to
me
one
day
my
mistress
sent
me
to
carry
an
urgent
letter
to
the
illustrious
master
he
handed
me
the
reply
himself
then
i
made
bold
to
put
to
him
the
question
that
tormented
me
pretending
however
that
the
heroine
of
this
ticklish
and
obscure
story
was
a
friend
of
mine
paul
bourget
asked
what
is
your
friend
a
woman
of
the
people
a
poor
woman
undoubtedly
a
chambermaid
like
myself
illustrious
master
a
superior
grimace
a
look
of
disdain
appeared
on
bourget
face
ah
he
does
not
like
the
poor
i
do
not
occupy
myself
with
these
souls
said
he
these
are
too
little
souls
they
are
not
even
souls
they
are
outside
the
province
of
my
psychology
i
understood
that
in
this
province
one
begins
to
be
a
soul
only
with
an
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
not
so
jules
lemaitre
also
a
familiar
of
the
house
when
i
asked
him
the
same
question
he
answered
prettily
catching
me
about
the
waist
well
charming
célestine
your
friend
is
a
good
girl
that
is
all
and
if
she
resembles
you
i
would
say
a
couple
of
words
to
her
you
know
hey
hey
hey
he
at
least
with
his
face
of
a
little
humpbacked
and
faun
put
on
no
airs
and
he
was
what
a
pity
that
he
has
fallen
among
the
priests
with
all
that
i
know
not
what
would
have
become
of
me
in
that
hell
of
an
audierne
if
the
little
sisters
of
finding
me
intelligent
and
pretty
had
not
taken
me
in
out
of
pity
they
did
not
take
advantage
of
my
age
of
my
ignorance
of
my
trying
and
despised
situation
to
make
use
of
me
to
secrete
me
for
their
benefit
as
often
happens
in
such
establishments
which
carry
human
exploitation
to
the
point
of
crime
they
were
poor
candid
timid
charitable
little
beings
who
were
not
rich
and
who
did
not
even
dare
to
extend
their
hands
to
or
to
beg
at
the
doors
of
houses
there
was
sometimes
much
poverty
among
them
but
they
got
along
as
best
they
could
and
amid
all
the
difficulties
of
living
they
continued
none
the
less
to
be
gay
and
to
sing
continually
like
larks
their
ignorance
of
life
had
something
touching
about
it
something
which
brings
the
tears
to
my
eyes
now
that
i
can
better
understand
their
infinite
and
pure
kindness
they
taught
me
to
read
to
write
to
sew
to
do
housework
and
when
i
had
become
almost
expert
in
these
necessary
things
they
got
me
a
place
as
a
little
housemaid
in
the
house
of
a
retired
colonel
who
came
every
summer
with
his
wife
and
his
two
daughters
to
occupy
a
sort
of
dilapidated
little
château
near
comfort
worthy
people
certainly
but
so
sad
so
sad
and
maniacs
too
never
a
smile
on
their
faces
never
a
sign
of
joy
in
their
garments
which
were
always
black
the
colonel
had
had
a
lathe
put
in
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
there
all
day
long
he
turned
egg
cups
out
of
or
else
those
oval
balls
called
eggs
which
housewives
use
in
mending
stockings
madame
drew
up
petition
after
petition
in
order
to
obtain
a
and
the
two
daughters
saying
nothing
doing
nothing
one
with
a
duck
beak
the
other
with
a
rabbit
face
yellow
and
thin
angular
and
faded
dried
up
on
the
spot
like
two
plants
lacking
everything
soil
water
sunshine
they
bored
me
enormously
at
the
end
of
eight
months
i
left
them
in
a
moment
of
rashness
which
i
have
regretted
but
then
i
heard
paris
breathing
and
living
around
me
its
breath
filled
my
heart
with
new
desires
although
i
did
not
go
out
often
i
had
admired
with
a
prodigious
astonishment
the
streets
the
the
crowds
the
palaces
the
brilliant
equipages
the
jeweled
women
and
when
at
night
i
went
to
bed
in
the
sixth
story
i
envied
the
other
domestics
of
the
house
and
their
pranks
which
i
found
charming
and
their
stories
which
left
me
in
a
state
of
marvelous
surprise
though
i
remained
in
the
house
but
a
short
time
i
saw
there
at
night
in
the
sixth
story
all
sorts
of
debaucheries
and
took
my
part
in
them
with
the
enthusiasm
and
emulation
of
a
novice
oh
the
vague
hopes
and
the
uncertain
ambitions
that
i
cherished
there
in
that
fallacious
ideal
of
pleasure
and
vice
alas
yes
one
is
young
one
knows
nothing
of
life
one
entertains
imaginations
and
dreams
oh
the
dreams
stupidities
i
have
supped
on
them
in
the
words
of
xavier
a
prettily
perverted
boy
of
whom
i
shall
have
something
to
say
later
and
i
have
rolled
oh
how
i
have
rolled
it
is
frightful
when
i
think
of
it
yet
i
am
not
old
but
i
have
had
a
very
close
view
of
things
i
have
seen
people
naked
and
i
have
sniffed
the
odor
of
their
linen
of
their
skin
of
their
soul
in
spite
of
perfumes
they
do
not
smell
good
all
that
a
respected
interior
all
that
a
respectable
family
can
hide
in
the
way
of
filth
shameful
vices
and
base
crimes
beneath
the
appearance
of
virtue
ah
i
know
it
well
it
makes
no
difference
if
they
are
rich
if
they
have
rags
of
silk
and
velvet
and
gilded
furniture
it
makes
no
difference
if
they
wash
in
silver
tubs
and
make
a
great
show
i
know
them
they
are
not
clean
and
their
heart
is
more
disgusting
than
was
my
mother
bed
oh
how
a
poor
domestic
is
to
be
pitied
and
how
lonely
she
is
she
may
live
in
houses
full
of
joyous
and
noisy
people
but
how
lonely
she
is
always
solitude
does
not
consist
in
living
alone
it
consists
in
living
with
others
with
people
who
take
no
interest
in
you
with
whom
you
count
for
less
than
a
dog
gorged
with
goodies
or
than
a
flower
cared
for
as
tenderly
as
a
rich
man
child
people
of
whom
you
have
nothing
but
their
garments
or
the
spoiled
remains
of
their
table
you
may
eat
this
pear
it
is
rotten
finish
this
chicken
in
the
kitchen
it
smells
bad
every
word
is
contemptuous
of
you
every
gesture
disparaging
of
you
placing
you
on
a
level
lower
than
that
of
the
beasts
and
you
must
say
nothing
you
must
smile
and
give
thanks
unless
you
would
pass
for
an
ingrate
or
a
wicked
heart
sometimes
when
doing
my
mistresses
hair
i
have
had
a
mad
desire
to
tear
their
neck
to
scratch
their
bosom
with
my
nails
fortunately
one
is
not
always
under
the
influence
of
these
gloomy
ideas
one
shakes
them
off
and
arranges
matters
to
get
all
the
fun
one
can
by
himself
this
evening
after
dinner
marianne
seeing
that
i
was
utterly
sad
was
moved
to
pity
and
tried
to
console
me
she
went
to
get
a
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
depths
of
the
sideboard
where
it
stood
among
a
heap
of
old
papers
and
dirty
rags
you
must
not
grieve
like
that
she
said
to
me
you
must
shake
yourself
a
little
my
poor
little
one
you
must
console
yourself
and
having
poured
me
out
a
drink
she
sat
for
an
hour
with
elbows
on
the
table
and
in
a
drawling
and
lamenting
voice
told
me
gloomy
stories
of
sickness
of
of
the
death
of
her
mother
of
her
father
and
of
her
sister
with
every
minute
her
voice
became
thicker
her
eyes
moistened
and
she
repeated
as
she
licked
her
glass
you
must
not
grieve
like
that
the
death
of
your
mamma
oh
it
is
a
great
misfortune
but
what
do
you
expect
we
are
all
mortal
oh
my
god
oh
my
poor
little
one
then
she
suddenly
began
to
weep
and
weep
and
while
she
wept
and
wept
she
did
not
cease
to
wail
you
must
not
grieve
you
must
not
grieve
at
first
it
was
a
plaint
but
soon
it
became
a
sort
of
frightful
bray
which
grew
louder
and
louder
and
her
big
belly
and
her
big
breasts
and
her
triple
chin
shaken
by
her
sobs
heaved
in
enormous
surges
be
still
then
marianne
i
said
to
her
madame
might
hear
you
and
come
but
she
did
not
listen
to
me
and
crying
louder
than
ever
exclaimed
ah
what
a
misfortune
what
a
great
misfortune
so
that
i
too
my
stomach
turned
by
drink
and
my
heart
moved
by
marianne
tears
began
to
sob
like
a
madeleine
all
the
same
she
is
not
a
bad
girl
but
i
am
getting
tired
here
i
am
getting
tired
i
am
getting
tired
i
should
like
to
get
a
place
in
the
house
of
some
member
of
the
or
else
in
america
vi
poor
monsieur
i
believe
that
i
was
too
sharp
with
him
the
other
day
in
the
garden
perhaps
i
went
further
than
i
should
he
is
such
a
simpleton
that
he
imagines
that
he
has
given
me
serious
offence
and
that
my
virtue
is
impregnable
oh
his
humiliated
imploring
looks
which
never
cease
to
ask
my
pardon
although
i
have
become
more
teasing
and
agreeable
he
says
no
more
to
me
about
the
matter
and
can
not
make
up
his
mind
to
try
a
new
direct
attack
not
even
the
classic
device
of
a
button
to
be
sewed
on
a
pair
of
pantaloons
a
clumsy
device
but
one
that
does
not
often
fail
of
its
effect
my
god
how
many
such
buttons
have
i
sewed
on
and
yet
it
is
plain
that
he
desires
me
that
he
is
dying
of
desire
more
and
more
the
least
of
his
words
betrays
a
confession
an
indirect
confession
of
his
desire
and
what
a
confession
but
he
is
also
more
and
more
timid
he
is
afraid
to
come
to
a
decision
he
fears
that
it
might
bring
about
a
definite
rupture
and
he
no
longer
trusts
in
my
encouraging
looks
on
one
occasion
approaching
me
with
a
strange
expression
with
a
sort
of
haggard
look
in
his
eyes
he
said
to
me
célestine
you
you
black
my
shoes
very
well
very
very
well
never
have
my
shoes
been
blacked
like
that
then
i
expected
the
button
trick
but
no
monsieur
gasped
and
slobbered
as
if
he
had
eaten
a
pear
that
was
too
big
and
juicy
then
he
whistled
for
his
dog
and
started
off
but
here
is
something
stronger
yesterday
madame
had
gone
to
market
for
she
does
her
own
marketing
monsieur
had
been
out
since
dawn
with
his
gun
and
his
dog
he
came
back
early
having
killed
three
thrushes
and
immediately
went
up
to
his
to
take
a
tub
and
dress
as
usual
oh
for
that
matter
monsieur
is
very
clean
and
he
is
not
afraid
of
water
i
thought
it
a
favorable
opportunity
to
try
something
that
might
at
last
put
him
at
his
ease
with
me
leaving
my
work
i
started
for
the
and
for
a
few
seconds
i
stood
there
listening
with
my
ear
glued
to
the
door
monsieur
was
walking
back
and
forth
in
his
room
he
was
whistling
and
singing
et
allez
donc
suzon
et
ron
ronron
petit
patapon
a
habit
that
he
has
of
mingling
a
number
of
refrains
when
singing
i
heard
chairs
moving
about
cupboards
opening
and
closing
and
then
the
water
streaming
into
the
tub
and
the
ahs
and
ohs
and
fuuiis
and
brrrs
which
the
shock
of
the
cold
water
wrung
from
monsieur
then
suddenly
i
opened
the
door
monsieur
stood
facing
me
shivering
with
wet
skin
and
the
sponge
in
his
hands
running
like
a
fountain
oh
his
head
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
stand
transfixed
i
think
i
never
saw
a
man
so
astounded
having
nothing
with
which
to
cover
his
body
with
a
gesture
instinctively
modest
and
comical
he
used
the
sponge
as
a
it
required
great
strength
of
will
on
my
part
to
suppress
the
laugh
which
this
spectacle
loosened
within
me
i
noticed
that
monsieur
had
thick
tufts
of
hair
on
his
shoulders
and
that
his
chest
was
like
a
bear
but
my
he
is
a
fine
man
all
the
same
naturally
i
uttered
a
cry
of
alarmed
modesty
as
was
proper
and
closed
the
door
again
violently
but
once
outside
the
door
i
said
to
myself
surely
he
will
call
me
back
and
what
is
going
to
happen
then
i
waited
some
minutes
not
a
sound
except
the
crystalline
sound
of
a
drop
of
water
falling
from
time
to
time
into
the
tub
he
is
reflecting
thought
i
he
does
not
dare
to
come
to
a
decision
but
he
will
call
me
back
in
vain
soon
the
water
streamed
again
then
i
heard
monsieur
wiping
and
rubbing
himself
and
clearing
his
throat
old
slippers
dragged
over
the
floor
chairs
moved
about
and
cupboards
opened
and
closed
finally
monsieur
began
again
to
sing
et
allez
donc
suzon
et
ron
ronron
petit
patapon
no
really
he
is
too
stupid
i
murmured
in
a
low
voice
furiously
spiteful
and
i
went
back
to
the
firmly
resolved
to
take
no
further
pity
on
him
in
the
afternoon
monsieur
kept
revolving
around
me
in
an
way
he
joined
me
in
the
yard
whither
i
had
gone
to
throw
some
refuse
on
the
and
as
i
for
the
sake
of
laughing
a
little
at
his
embarrassment
apologized
for
what
had
happened
in
the
morning
he
whispered
that
is
nothing
that
is
nothing
on
the
contrary
he
tried
to
detain
me
stammering
i
know
not
what
but
i
dropped
him
then
and
there
in
the
middle
of
the
phrase
in
which
he
was
floundering
and
in
a
cutting
voice
i
said
these
words
i
ask
monsieur
pardon
i
have
no
time
to
talk
to
monsieur
madame
is
waiting
for
me
célestine
listen
to
me
a
moment
no
monsieur
when
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
path
leading
to
the
house
i
could
see
monsieur
he
had
not
stirred
from
the
spot
with
head
lowered
and
irresolute
legs
he
was
still
looking
at
the
scratching
his
neck
after
dinner
in
the
monsieur
and
madame
had
a
hot
quarrel
madame
said
i
tell
you
that
you
are
paying
attention
to
this
girl
monsieur
answered
i
well
indeed
that
an
idea
come
my
pet
such
a
loose
creature
a
dirty
thing
and
possibly
diseased
oh
really
that
is
too
much
madame
resumed
do
you
think
then
that
i
do
know
your
conduct
and
your
tastes
permit
me
oh
permit
me
and
all
the
dirty
creatures
whom
you
meet
in
the
fields
i
heard
the
floor
creak
under
monsieur
feet
as
he
walked
back
and
forth
in
the
with
feverish
animation
i
well
indeed
such
ideas
as
you
have
where
did
you
find
them
all
my
pet
madame
was
obstinate
and
the
little
jézureau
and
only
fifteen
years
old
you
wretch
and
on
whose
account
i
had
to
pay
five
hundred
francs
but
for
which
you
perhaps
would
be
in
prison
like
your
thief
of
a
father
monsieur
stopped
walking
he
sank
into
a
chair
he
became
silent
the
discussion
ended
with
these
words
from
madame
however
it
is
all
one
to
me
i
am
not
jealous
you
can
behave
as
you
like
with
this
célestine
but
it
must
not
cost
me
any
money
oh
no
now
i
have
them
both
this
evening
we
remained
longer
than
usual
in
the
kitchen
i
helped
marianne
to
make
up
her
accounts
she
did
not
succeed
in
getting
them
straight
i
have
noticed
that
like
all
trusted
persons
she
pinches
here
and
steals
there
all
that
she
can
she
even
has
tricks
that
astonish
me
but
she
has
to
make
her
accounts
square
with
them
sometimes
she
gets
lost
in
her
figures
which
embarrasses
her
greatly
with
madame
who
is
very
quick
to
find
out
anything
wrong
in
them
joseph
is
becoming
a
little
more
human
with
us
now
from
time
to
time
he
condescends
to
speak
to
me
this
evening
for
instance
he
did
not
go
as
usual
to
see
the
sacristan
his
intimate
friend
and
while
marianne
and
i
were
working
he
read
the
libre
parole
that
is
his
newspaper
he
does
not
admit
that
any
other
is
fit
to
read
i
have
noticed
that
several
times
while
reading
he
looked
at
me
with
a
new
expression
in
his
eyes
the
reading
finished
joseph
saw
fit
to
tell
me
what
his
political
opinions
are
he
is
weary
of
the
republic
which
is
ruining
and
disgracing
him
he
wants
a
sword
as
long
as
we
do
not
have
a
sword
and
a
very
red
one
there
will
be
nothing
done
said
he
he
is
for
religion
because
in
short
well
he
is
for
religion
until
religion
shall
have
been
restored
in
france
as
we
used
to
have
it
until
everybody
is
obliged
to
go
to
mass
and
to
confession
there
will
be
nothing
done
my
god
he
has
hung
up
in
his
portraits
of
the
pope
and
of
drumont
in
his
chamber
that
of
déroulède
in
the
little
those
of
guérin
and
general
mercier
terrible
fellows
patriots
real
frenchmen
he
preciously
collects
all
the
songs
all
the
colored
portraits
of
the
generals
all
the
caricatures
of
the
circumcised
for
joseph
is
violently
he
belongs
to
all
the
religious
military
and
patriotic
societies
of
the
department
he
is
a
member
of
the
youth
of
rouen
a
member
of
the
old
age
of
louviers
and
a
member
also
of
an
infinite
number
of
groups
and
such
as
the
national
cudgel
the
norman
the
bayados
du
vexin
etc
when
he
speaks
of
the
jews
there
are
sinister
gleams
in
his
eyes
and
his
gestures
show
bloodthirsty
ferocity
and
he
never
goes
to
town
without
a
club
as
long
as
there
is
a
jew
left
in
france
there
is
nothing
done
and
he
adds
ah
my
god
if
i
were
in
paris
i
would
kill
and
burn
and
gut
these
cursed
sheenies
there
is
no
danger
that
the
traitors
will
come
to
live
at
they
know
very
well
what
they
are
about
these
mercenaries
he
joins
in
one
and
the
same
hatred
protestants
free
masons
freethinkers
all
the
brigands
who
never
set
foot
in
the
churches
and
who
are
moreover
nothing
but
jews
in
disguise
but
he
does
not
belong
to
the
clerical
party
he
is
for
religion
that
all
as
for
the
ignoble
dreyfus
he
had
better
not
think
of
coming
back
to
france
from
devil
island
oh
no
and
joseph
strongly
advises
the
unclean
zola
not
to
come
to
louviers
to
give
a
lecture
as
it
is
reported
that
he
intends
to
do
his
hash
would
be
settled
and
joseph
himself
would
settle
it
this
miserable
traitor
of
a
zola
who
for
six
hundred
thousand
francs
has
delivered
the
entire
french
army
and
also
the
entire
russian
army
to
the
germans
and
the
english
and
this
is
no
humbug
no
gossip
no
word
no
joseph
is
sure
of
it
joseph
has
it
from
the
sacristan
who
has
it
from
the
priest
who
has
it
from
the
bishop
who
has
it
from
the
pope
who
has
it
from
drumont
ah
the
jews
may
visit
the
priory
they
will
find
written
by
joseph
in
the
cellar
in
the
attic
in
the
stable
in
the
under
the
lining
of
the
harnesses
and
even
on
the
and
everywhere
these
words
long
live
the
army
death
to
the
jews
from
time
to
time
marianne
approves
these
violent
remarks
with
nods
of
her
head
and
silent
gestures
she
too
undoubtedly
is
being
ruined
and
disgraced
by
the
republic
she
too
is
for
the
sword
for
the
priests
and
against
the
jews
about
whom
she
knows
nothing
by
the
way
except
that
they
are
lacking
something
somewhere
and
certainly
i
too
am
for
the
army
for
the
country
for
religion
and
against
the
jews
who
then
among
us
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
does
not
profess
these
doctrines
say
what
you
will
of
the
domestics
it
is
possible
that
they
have
many
faults
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
they
are
patriots
take
myself
for
instance
politics
is
not
in
my
line
and
it
bores
me
but
a
week
before
i
started
for
this
place
i
squarely
refused
to
serve
as
chambermaid
in
the
house
of
labori
and
all
the
comrades
who
were
at
the
that
day
refused
also
work
for
that
dirty
creature
oh
no
indeed
never
yet
when
i
seriously
question
myself
i
do
not
know
why
i
am
against
the
jews
for
i
used
to
serve
in
their
houses
in
the
days
when
one
could
still
do
so
with
dignity
i
find
that
at
bottom
the
jews
and
the
catholics
are
very
much
alike
they
are
equally
vicious
have
equally
vile
characters
equally
ugly
souls
they
all
belong
to
the
same
world
you
see
and
the
difference
in
religion
counts
for
nothing
perhaps
the
jews
make
more
show
more
noise
perhaps
they
make
a
greater
display
of
the
money
that
they
spend
but
in
spite
of
what
you
hear
about
their
management
and
their
avarice
i
maintain
that
it
is
not
bad
to
be
in
their
houses
where
there
is
even
more
leakage
than
in
catholic
houses
but
joseph
will
hear
nothing
of
all
this
he
reproached
me
with
being
a
bogus
patriot
and
a
bad
frenchwoman
and
with
prophecies
of
massacre
on
his
lips
and
with
bloody
visions
of
broken
heads
and
gashed
bellies
before
his
eyes
he
went
off
to
bed
straightway
marianne
took
the
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
sideboard
we
needed
to
recover
ourselves
and
we
talked
of
something
else
marianne
who
every
day
becomes
more
confiding
told
me
of
her
childhood
of
the
hard
time
that
she
had
in
her
youth
and
how
when
in
the
employ
as
a
servant
of
a
woman
who
kept
a
at
caen
she
was
seduced
by
a
a
delicate
slender
blonde
young
fellow
who
had
blue
eyes
and
a
pointed
short
and
silky
beard
oh
how
silky
she
became
pregnant
and
the
tobacco
merchant
who
herself
was
intimate
with
any
number
of
people
including
all
the
of
the
garrison
turned
her
out
so
young
on
the
pavements
of
a
great
city
and
carrying
a
child
ah
the
poverty
that
she
experienced
her
friend
having
no
money
and
surely
she
would
have
died
of
hunger
if
the
surgeon
had
not
found
her
a
queer
place
in
the
medical
school
my
god
yes
she
said
at
the
boratory
i
killed
rabbits
and
it
was
very
nice
and
the
recollection
brought
to
marianne
thick
lips
a
smile
that
seemed
to
me
strangely
melancholy
after
a
silence
i
asked
her
and
the
kid
what
became
of
it
marianne
made
a
vague
and
gesture
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
pull
aside
the
heavy
veils
from
the
limbos
where
her
child
was
sleeping
she
answered
in
that
harsh
voice
which
alcohol
produces
oh
well
you
can
imagine
what
should
i
have
done
with
it
my
god
like
the
little
then
that
it
and
she
poured
herself
out
a
drink
we
went
up
to
our
rooms
somewhat
intoxicated
vii
decidedly
autumn
is
here
frosts
which
were
not
expected
so
soon
have
browned
the
last
flowers
of
the
garden
the
dahlias
the
poor
dahlias
witnesses
of
monsieur
amorous
timidity
are
dried
up
dried
up
also
are
the
big
sunflowers
that
mounted
guard
at
the
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
devastated
nothing
but
a
few
geraniums
here
and
there
and
five
or
six
clusters
of
asters
whose
blue
flowers
the
dull
blue
of
rottenness
are
bending
toward
the
ground
in
anticipation
of
death
the
of
captain
mauger
whom
i
saw
just
now
over
the
hedge
present
a
scene
of
veritable
disaster
and
everything
is
of
the
color
of
tobacco
the
trees
through
the
fields
are
beginning
to
turn
yellow
and
to
lose
their
foliage
and
the
sky
is
funereal
for
four
days
we
have
been
living
in
a
thick
fog
a
brown
fog
that
smelt
of
soot
and
that
did
not
dissipate
even
in
the
afternoon
now
it
is
raining
an
icy
beating
rain
which
a
fierce
wind
blowing
in
squalls
from
the
northwest
occasionally
intensifies
ah
i
am
not
comfortably
situated
here
in
my
room
it
is
bitter
cold
the
wind
blows
into
it
and
the
water
penetrates
the
cracks
in
the
roof
principally
around
the
two
windows
which
stingily
illuminate
this
dark
hole
and
the
noise
of
lifting
slates
of
shocks
that
shake
the
roof
of
creaking
timbers
and
of
squeaking
hinges
is
deafening
in
spite
of
the
urgent
need
of
repairs
i
have
had
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
in
getting
madame
to
order
the
plumber
to
come
morning
and
i
do
not
dare
yet
to
ask
for
a
stove
although
being
very
chilly
i
feel
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
live
in
this
mortal
room
through
the
winter
this
evening
to
stop
the
wind
and
the
rain
i
have
had
to
stuff
old
skirts
into
the
cracks
and
this
above
my
head
never
ceasing
to
turn
on
its
rusty
pivot
at
times
shrieks
out
so
sharply
in
the
night
that
one
would
take
it
for
madame
voice
in
the
corridors
after
a
scene
my
first
feelings
of
revolt
having
quieted
down
a
little
my
life
proceeds
here
monotonously
and
stupidly
and
i
am
gradually
getting
accustomed
to
it
without
too
great
moral
suffering
no
one
ever
comes
here
one
would
take
it
for
a
cursed
house
and
outside
of
the
petty
domestic
incidents
that
i
have
related
never
does
anything
happen
all
the
days
are
alike
and
all
the
tasks
and
all
the
faces
it
is
ennui
and
death
but
i
am
beginning
to
be
so
stupid
that
i
am
accommodating
myself
to
this
ennui
as
if
it
were
a
natural
thing
even
the
deprivation
of
love
does
not
cause
me
too
much
embarrassment
and
i
endure
without
too
painful
struggles
this
chastity
to
which
i
am
condemned
or
to
which
rather
i
have
condemned
myself
for
i
have
abandoned
monsieur
i
have
dropped
monsieur
finally
monsieur
bores
me
and
i
am
angry
with
him
for
having
out
of
cowardice
disparaged
me
so
grossly
in
talking
with
madame
not
that
he
is
becoming
resigned
or
ceasing
to
pay
attention
to
me
on
the
contrary
he
persists
in
revolving
about
me
with
eyes
that
grow
rounder
and
rounder
and
a
mouth
that
grows
more
and
more
frothy
according
to
an
expression
that
i
have
read
in
i
have
forgotten
what
book
it
is
always
toward
my
trough
that
he
drives
the
pigs
of
his
desire
to
drink
now
that
the
days
are
shortening
monsieur
spends
the
afternoon
at
his
desk
where
he
does
the
devil
knows
what
occupying
his
time
in
moving
about
old
papers
without
reason
in
checking
off
and
medical
advertisements
and
in
distractedly
turning
the
leaves
of
old
you
should
see
him
when
i
go
in
at
night
to
close
the
blinds
or
attend
to
his
fire
then
he
rises
coughs
sneezes
clears
his
throat
runs
against
the
furniture
upsets
objects
and
tries
in
all
sorts
of
stupid
ways
to
attract
my
attention
it
is
enough
to
make
one
twist
with
laughter
i
make
a
pretence
of
hearing
nothing
of
not
understanding
his
puerile
tricks
and
i
go
away
silent
and
haughty
without
looking
at
him
any
more
than
if
he
were
not
there
last
evening
however
we
exchanged
the
following
brief
remarks
célestine
monsieur
desires
something
célestine
you
are
unkind
to
me
why
are
you
unkind
to
me
why
monsieur
knows
very
well
that
i
am
a
loose
creature
oh
come
a
dirty
thing
oh
come
come
and
possibly
diseased
oh
heavens
célestine
come
célestine
listen
to
me
bah
oh
i
have
enough
of
him
it
no
longer
amuses
me
to
upset
his
head
and
his
heart
by
my
coquetries
in
fact
nothing
amuses
me
here
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
nothing
bores
me
either
is
it
the
air
of
this
dirty
country
the
silence
of
the
fields
the
heavy
coarse
food
that
i
eat
a
feeling
of
torpor
is
taking
possession
of
me
a
feeling
moreover
which
is
not
without
charm
at
any
rate
it
dulls
my
sensibility
deadens
my
dreams
and
helps
me
to
endure
madame
insolence
and
scolding
thanks
to
it
also
i
feel
a
certain
content
in
chattering
at
night
for
hours
with
marianne
and
joseph
this
strange
joseph
who
does
not
go
out
any
more
and
seems
to
find
pleasure
in
remaining
with
us
the
idea
that
joseph
perhaps
is
in
love
with
me
well
that
flatters
me
yes
indeed
i
have
got
to
that
point
and
then
i
read
and
read
novels
novels
and
more
novels
i
have
reread
paul
bourget
his
books
do
not
excite
my
enthusiasm
as
they
used
to
in
fact
they
tire
me
and
i
consider
them
false
and
superficial
they
are
conceived
in
that
state
of
soul
which
i
know
well
from
having
experienced
it
when
dazzled
and
fascinated
i
came
in
contact
with
wealth
and
luxury
i
am
all
over
it
and
these
things
no
longer
astonish
me
they
still
astonish
paul
bourget
oh
i
would
not
be
so
silly
now
as
to
go
to
him
for
psychological
explanations
for
i
know
better
than
he
what
there
is
behind
a
parlor
portière
and
under
a
lace
dress
a
thing
to
which
i
can
not
get
accustomed
is
the
receiving
of
no
letters
from
paris
every
morning
when
the
carrier
comes
i
feel
a
sort
of
laceration
in
my
heart
at
realizing
that
i
am
so
abandoned
by
everybody
and
it
is
in
this
way
that
i
can
best
measure
the
extent
of
my
solitude
in
vain
have
i
written
to
my
old
comrades
and
especially
to
monsieur
jean
urgent
and
disconsolate
letters
in
vain
have
i
implored
them
to
pay
some
attention
to
me
to
take
me
out
of
my
hell
to
find
me
a
place
in
paris
however
humble
it
may
be
not
one
of
them
answers
me
i
would
never
have
believed
in
so
much
indifference
in
so
much
ingratitude
and
this
forces
me
to
cling
more
tightly
to
what
i
have
left
my
memories
and
the
past
memories
in
which
in
spite
of
everything
joy
dominates
suffering
a
past
which
renews
my
hope
that
all
is
not
over
with
me
and
that
it
is
not
true
that
an
accidental
fall
means
irreparable
ruin
that
is
why
alone
in
my
room
while
on
the
other
side
of
my
partition
marianne
snoring
represents
to
me
the
distressing
present
i
try
to
drown
this
ridiculous
sound
in
the
sound
of
my
joys
and
i
passionately
scrutinize
this
past
in
order
to
reconstruct
from
its
scattered
bits
the
illusion
of
a
future
this
very
day
october
is
a
date
full
of
recollections
during
the
five
years
that
have
elapsed
since
the
tragedy
which
i
now
desire
to
relate
all
the
details
have
remained
within
me
there
is
a
dead
boy
in
this
tragedy
a
poor
little
dead
boy
sweet
and
pretty
whom
i
killed
by
giving
him
too
many
caresses
and
too
many
joys
by
giving
him
too
much
of
life
and
during
the
five
years
since
he
died
died
of
me
this
will
be
the
first
time
that
i
have
not
gone
on
the
sixth
of
october
to
cover
his
grave
with
the
usual
flowers
but
of
these
flowers
which
i
shall
not
carry
to
his
grave
i
will
make
a
more
durable
bouquet
which
will
adorn
and
perfume
his
beloved
memory
better
than
the
graveyard
flowers
adorn
and
perfume
the
bit
of
earth
in
which
he
sleeps
for
the
flowers
of
which
the
bouquet
that
i
shall
make
will
be
composed
i
will
gather
one
by
one
in
the
garden
of
my
heart
in
the
garden
of
my
heart
where
not
only
grow
the
mortal
flowers
of
debauchery
but
where
bloom
also
the
great
white
lilies
of
love
i
remember
that
it
was
on
a
saturday
at
the
in
the
rue
du
colisée
which
i
had
visited
regularly
every
morning
for
a
week
in
search
of
a
place
i
was
introduced
to
an
old
lady
in
mourning
never
had
i
met
a
face
more
engaging
a
look
more
gentle
manners
more
simple
never
had
i
heard
more
winning
words
she
received
me
with
a
great
politeness
that
warmed
my
heart
my
child
she
said
to
me
mme
that
was
the
name
of
the
woman
who
kept
the
has
spoken
to
me
of
you
in
terms
of
the
highest
praise
i
believe
that
you
deserve
it
for
you
have
an
intelligent
face
frank
and
gay
which
pleases
me
greatly
i
am
in
need
of
a
person
worthy
of
trust
and
capable
of
devotion
devotion
ah
i
know
that
i
am
asking
a
thing
that
it
is
not
easy
to
give
for
after
all
you
do
not
know
me
and
you
have
no
reason
to
be
devoted
to
me
let
me
explain
to
you
my
situation
but
do
not
remain
standing
my
child
come
and
sit
down
beside
me
the
moment
i
am
spoken
to
gently
the
moment
that
i
am
not
looked
upon
as
a
being
outside
of
others
and
on
the
fringe
of
life
as
something
between
a
dog
and
a
parrot
in
that
moment
i
am
touched
and
at
once
i
feel
the
soul
of
my
childhood
reborn
within
me
all
my
spite
all
my
hatred
all
my
spirit
of
rebellion
i
forget
as
by
a
miracle
and
toward
the
people
who
speak
to
me
in
a
human
fashion
i
feel
no
sentiments
save
those
of
sacrifice
and
love
i
know
also
from
experience
that
it
is
only
the
unfortunate
who
place
the
suffering
of
the
humble
on
a
footing
with
their
own
there
is
always
insolence
and
distance
in
the
kindness
of
the
fortunate
when
i
had
taken
my
seat
beside
this
venerable
lady
in
mourning
i
already
loved
her
i
really
loved
her
she
sighed
it
is
not
a
very
gay
place
that
i
offer
you
my
child
with
a
sincerity
of
enthusiasm
that
did
not
escape
her
i
earnestly
protested
that
does
not
matter
madame
anything
that
madame
may
ask
of
me
i
will
do
and
it
was
true
i
was
ready
for
anything
she
thanked
me
with
a
kind
and
tender
look
and
continued
well
this
is
it
i
have
had
many
trials
in
my
life
i
have
lost
all
of
my
family
with
the
exception
of
a
grandson
who
now
he
also
is
threatened
with
death
from
the
terrible
disease
of
which
the
others
have
died
fearing
to
pronounce
the
name
of
this
terrible
disease
she
indicated
it
to
me
by
placing
upon
her
chest
her
old
hand
gloved
in
black
and
then
with
a
more
painful
expression
continued
poor
little
fellow
he
is
a
charming
child
an
adorable
being
in
whom
i
have
placed
my
last
hopes
for
when
he
is
gone
i
shall
be
all
alone
and
my
god
what
shall
i
do
upon
earth
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
wiped
them
away
with
her
handkerchief
and
went
on
the
doctors
assure
me
that
they
can
save
him
that
the
disease
is
not
yet
they
have
prescribed
a
from
which
they
expect
very
good
results
every
afternoon
georges
must
take
a
or
rather
he
must
dip
himself
for
a
second
in
the
sea
then
his
whole
body
must
be
rubbed
vigorously
with
a
to
stimulate
the
circulation
then
he
must
be
obliged
to
drink
a
glass
of
old
port
and
then
he
must
lie
stretched
for
at
least
an
hour
in
a
very
warm
bed
that
is
what
i
want
of
you
in
the
first
place
my
child
but
understand
me
well
what
i
specially
want
is
youth
grace
gaiety
life
in
my
house
it
is
these
things
that
are
most
lacking
i
have
two
very
devoted
servants
but
they
are
old
and
sad
and
possessed
of
manias
georges
can
not
endure
them
and
i
myself
with
my
old
white
head
and
my
perpetual
wearing
of
mourning
i
feel
that
i
am
an
affliction
to
him
and
what
is
worse
still
i
feel
also
that
i
often
am
unable
to
hide
from
him
my
apprehensions
oh
i
know
that
this
perhaps
is
not
exactly
the
for
a
young
girl
like
you
beside
so
young
a
boy
as
georges
for
he
is
only
nineteen
the
world
undoubtedly
will
find
something
to
say
about
it
but
i
care
not
for
the
world
i
care
only
for
my
sick
grandchild
and
i
have
confidence
in
you
you
are
a
good
woman
i
suppose
oh
yes
madame
i
cried
certain
in
advance
of
being
the
sort
of
saint
of
whom
this
disconsolate
grandmother
was
in
search
for
the
salvation
of
her
child
and
he
the
poor
little
one
my
god
in
his
condition
in
his
condition
you
see
he
needs
more
than
perhaps
the
continual
companionship
of
a
pretty
face
a
fresh
young
laugh
something
to
drive
from
his
mind
the
idea
of
death
some
one
to
give
him
confidence
in
life
will
you
undertake
it
i
accept
madame
i
answered
moved
to
the
depths
of
my
being
and
madame
may
be
sure
that
i
will
take
good
care
of
m
georges
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
enter
upon
my
duties
that
very
evening
and
that
we
should
start
on
the
next
day
but
one
for
houlgate
where
the
lady
in
mourning
had
rented
a
beautiful
villa
near
the
beach
the
grandmother
had
not
lied
georges
was
a
charming
an
adorable
child
his
beardless
face
had
the
loveliness
of
that
of
a
beautiful
woman
womanly
also
were
his
indolent
movements
and
his
long
white
supple
hands
through
which
could
be
seen
the
network
of
his
veins
but
what
ardent
eyes
pupils
consumed
by
a
dull
fire
beneath
eyelids
ringed
with
blue
and
seemingly
burned
by
the
flaming
gaze
what
an
intense
focus
of
thought
of
passion
of
sensibility
of
intelligence
of
inner
life
and
to
what
an
extent
already
had
the
red
flowers
of
death
invaded
his
cheeks
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
not
of
disease
as
if
it
were
not
of
death
that
he
was
dying
but
of
an
excess
of
life
of
the
fever
of
life
that
was
in
him
gnawing
at
his
organs
and
withering
his
flesh
oh
how
pretty
and
how
painful
a
spectacle
when
his
grandmother
took
me
to
him
he
was
stretched
on
a
long
chair
and
holding
in
his
long
white
hands
an
odorless
rose
he
received
me
not
as
a
servant
but
almost
as
a
friend
whom
he
expected
and
from
the
first
moment
i
became
attached
to
him
with
all
the
strength
of
my
soul
our
establishment
at
houlgate
was
effected
without
incident
as
our
journey
had
been
also
everything
was
ready
when
we
arrived
we
had
only
to
take
possession
of
the
villa
a
roomy
elegant
villa
full
of
life
and
gaiety
and
separated
from
the
beach
by
a
broad
terrace
covered
with
and
tents
of
many
colors
a
stone
stairway
cut
in
the
embankment
led
to
the
sea
and
against
its
lower
steps
sounded
the
music
of
the
waves
when
the
tide
was
coming
in
georges
room
on
the
ground
floor
commanded
an
admirable
view
of
the
sea
from
large
my
own
room
not
the
room
of
a
servant
but
that
of
a
master
was
opposite
georges
across
a
and
was
hung
with
light
cretonne
from
its
windows
one
looked
out
into
a
little
garden
where
were
growing
some
and
some
to
express
in
words
my
joy
my
pride
my
emotion
and
the
pure
and
new
elevation
of
mind
that
i
felt
at
being
thus
treated
and
petted
admitted
like
a
lady
to
comfort
to
luxury
and
to
a
share
in
that
thing
so
vainly
coveted
which
is
called
the
family
to
explain
how
by
a
simple
wave
of
the
wand
of
that
miraculous
fairy
kindness
there
came
instantly
an
end
to
the
recollection
of
my
past
humiliations
and
a
conception
of
all
the
duties
laid
upon
me
by
the
dignity
that
belongs
to
a
human
being
and
at
last
vouchsafed
to
me
is
quite
beyond
me
but
i
can
say
at
least
that
i
really
perceived
the
magic
of
the
transfiguration
not
only
did
the
mirror
testify
that
i
had
suddenly
become
more
beautiful
but
my
heart
assured
me
that
i
was
really
better
i
discovered
within
me
sources
sources
sources
inexhaustible
sources
sources
of
devotion
of
sacrifice
of
heroism
and
i
had
but
one
thought
to
save
by
intelligent
care
by
watchful
fidelity
and
by
marvellous
skill
to
save
georges
from
death
with
a
robust
faith
in
my
power
of
cure
i
said
in
positive
tones
to
the
poor
grandmother
who
was
in
a
state
of
perpetual
despair
and
often
spent
her
days
in
weeping
in
the
adjoining
room
do
not
weep
madame
we
will
save
him
i
swear
to
you
that
we
will
save
him
and
in
fact
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
time
georges
was
much
improved
a
great
change
in
his
condition
had
taken
place
the
fits
of
coughing
had
diminished
in
number
and
intensity
his
sleep
and
appetite
were
becoming
more
regular
he
no
longer
had
in
the
night
those
copious
and
terrible
sweats
that
left
him
gasping
and
exhausted
in
the
morning
his
strength
was
so
far
recovered
that
we
could
take
long
drives
and
short
walks
without
serious
fatigue
it
was
a
sort
of
resurrection
as
the
weather
was
very
fine
and
the
air
very
warm
but
tempered
by
the
on
days
when
we
did
not
leave
the
premises
we
spent
most
of
the
time
on
the
terrace
in
the
shelter
of
the
tents
awaiting
the
bathing
hour
the
hour
of
the
little
dip
in
the
sea
as
georges
gaily
called
it
for
he
was
gay
always
gay
never
did
he
speak
of
his
illness
never
of
death
i
really
believe
that
in
all
those
days
he
never
once
uttered
the
terrible
word
death
on
the
other
hand
he
was
much
amused
by
my
chatter
provoking
it
if
necessary
and
i
confiding
in
his
eyes
reassured
by
his
heart
won
by
his
indulgence
and
his
grace
told
him
everything
that
came
into
my
mind
farces
follies
and
songs
my
little
childhood
my
little
desires
my
little
misfortunes
and
my
dreams
and
my
rebellions
and
my
various
experiences
with
ludicrous
or
infamous
masters
i
told
him
all
without
much
masking
of
the
truth
for
young
though
he
was
and
separated
from
the
world
and
shut
up
as
he
had
always
been
he
nevertheless
by
a
sort
of
prescience
by
a
marvelous
divination
which
the
sick
possess
understood
life
thoroughly
a
real
friendship
that
his
nature
surely
facilitated
and
that
his
solitude
caused
him
to
desire
and
above
all
that
the
intimate
and
constant
care
with
which
i
delighted
his
poor
moribund
flesh
brought
about
so
to
speak
automatically
sprang
up
between
us
i
was
happy
to
a
degree
that
i
can
not
picture
and
my
mind
gained
in
refinement
by
incessant
contact
with
his
georges
adored
poetry
for
entire
hours
on
the
terrace
to
the
music
of
the
waves
or
else
at
night
in
his
room
he
asked
me
to
read
him
the
poems
of
victor
hugo
of
baudelaire
of
verlaine
of
mæterlinck
often
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
motionless
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
breast
and
i
thinking
that
he
was
asleep
stopped
reading
but
he
smiled
and
said
go
on
little
one
i
am
not
asleep
i
can
listen
better
so
i
hear
your
voice
better
and
your
voice
is
charming
sometimes
it
was
he
who
interrupted
me
after
concentrating
his
thoughts
he
slowly
recited
with
a
prolongation
of
the
rhythms
the
lines
that
had
excited
in
him
the
greatest
enthusiasm
and
he
tried
oh
how
i
loved
him
for
that
to
make
me
understand
them
to
make
me
feel
their
beauty
one
day
he
said
to
me
and
i
have
kept
these
words
as
a
relic
the
sublimity
of
poetry
you
see
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
does
not
take
an
educated
person
to
understand
it
and
to
love
it
on
the
contrary
the
educated
do
not
understand
it
and
generally
they
despise
it
because
they
have
too
much
pride
to
love
poetry
it
is
enough
to
have
a
soul
a
little
soul
naked
like
a
flower
poets
speak
to
the
souls
of
the
simple
of
the
sad
of
the
sick
and
that
is
why
they
are
eternal
do
you
know
that
when
one
has
sensibility
one
is
always
something
of
a
poet
and
you
yourself
little
célestine
have
often
said
to
me
things
that
are
as
beautiful
as
poetry
oh
monsieur
georges
you
are
making
fun
of
me
not
in
the
least
and
you
are
unaware
that
you
have
said
these
beautiful
things
and
that
is
the
delightful
part
of
it
for
me
those
were
unique
hours
whatever
destiny
may
bring
me
they
will
sing
in
my
heart
as
long
as
i
may
live
i
felt
that
indescribably
sweet
sensation
of
becoming
a
new
being
of
witnessing
so
to
speak
from
minute
to
minute
the
revelation
of
something
unknown
in
me
and
which
yet
was
i
and
in
spite
of
worse
falls
thoroughly
reconquered
as
i
am
by
all
that
is
bad
and
embittered
in
me
if
i
have
kept
this
passionate
fondness
for
reading
and
sometimes
that
impulse
toward
things
superior
to
my
social
environment
and
to
myself
if
trying
to
regain
confidence
in
the
spontaneity
of
my
nature
i
have
dared
i
who
am
so
ignorant
to
write
this
diary
it
is
to
georges
that
i
owe
it
oh
yes
i
was
happy
happy
especially
at
seeing
the
pretty
patient
gradually
reborn
his
flesh
swelling
out
and
his
face
blooming
again
through
the
flow
of
a
new
sap
happy
at
the
joy
and
the
hopes
and
the
certainties
that
the
rapidity
of
this
resurrection
gave
to
the
entire
house
of
which
i
was
now
the
queen
and
the
fairy
they
attributed
to
me
they
attributed
to
the
intelligence
of
my
care
to
the
vigilance
of
my
devotion
and
more
still
perhaps
to
my
constant
gaiety
to
my
youth
so
full
of
charm
to
my
surprising
influence
over
georges
this
incomparable
miracle
and
the
poor
grandmother
thanked
me
overwhelmed
me
with
gratitude
and
blessings
and
also
with
presents
like
a
nurse
to
whom
has
been
confided
a
baby
almost
dead
and
who
with
her
pure
and
healthy
milk
reconstructs
his
organs
brings
back
his
smile
and
restores
him
to
life
sometimes
forgetful
of
her
station
she
took
my
hands
caressed
them
kissed
them
and
with
tears
of
joy
said
to
me
i
knew
very
well
i
when
i
saw
you
i
knew
very
well
and
already
projects
were
being
formed
journeys
to
the
land
of
sunshine
fields
full
of
roses
you
shall
never
leave
us
never
more
my
child
her
enthusiasm
often
embarrassed
me
but
i
finally
came
to
believe
that
i
deserved
it
if
as
many
others
would
have
done
in
my
place
i
had
chosen
to
abuse
her
generosity
oh
misfortune
and
what
was
to
happen
happened
on
the
day
of
which
i
speak
the
weather
had
been
very
warm
very
heavy
and
very
threatening
across
the
sky
above
the
leaden
and
perfectly
flat
sea
rolled
stifling
clouds
thick
red
clouds
through
which
the
storm
could
not
break
georges
had
not
gone
out
even
to
the
terrace
and
we
had
remained
in
his
room
more
nervous
than
usual
a
nervousness
due
undoubtedly
to
the
electricity
in
the
atmosphere
he
had
even
refused
to
let
me
read
poetry
to
him
that
would
tire
me
he
said
and
besides
i
feel
that
you
would
read
very
badly
he
had
gone
into
the
where
he
had
tried
to
play
a
little
on
the
piano
the
piano
having
plagued
him
he
had
at
once
come
back
into
the
room
where
he
had
sought
to
divert
himself
for
a
moment
by
drawing
as
it
seemed
to
me
some
feminine
profiles
but
he
had
not
been
slow
in
abandoning
paper
and
pencil
fuming
with
some
impatience
i
can
not
i
am
not
in
the
mood
my
hand
trembles
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
and
you
there
is
something
the
matter
with
you
too
you
are
restless
finally
he
had
stretched
himself
on
his
long
chair
near
the
large
through
which
one
could
see
a
vast
expanse
of
water
in
the
distance
fleeing
from
the
storm
were
the
port
of
trouville
with
a
distracted
look
he
followed
their
manoeuvres
and
their
grey
sails
as
georges
had
said
i
was
restless
i
could
not
keep
still
i
was
continually
moving
about
to
find
something
with
which
to
occupy
his
mind
of
course
i
found
nothing
and
my
agitation
did
not
have
a
quieting
influence
on
his
why
do
you
move
about
so
why
do
you
enervate
yourself
stay
beside
me
i
had
asked
him
would
you
not
like
to
be
on
one
of
those
little
boats
yonder
i
would
oh
do
not
talk
for
the
sake
of
talking
why
say
useless
things
stay
beside
me
scarcely
had
i
taken
my
seat
beside
him
when
the
sight
of
the
sea
becoming
utterly
unendurable
to
him
he
asked
me
to
lower
the
blind
this
bad
light
exasperates
me
this
sea
is
horrible
i
do
not
wish
to
look
at
it
everything
is
horrible
i
do
not
wish
to
see
anything
i
wish
to
see
you
only
i
had
gently
chided
him
oh
monsieur
georges
you
are
not
good
you
are
not
behaving
well
if
your
grandmother
were
to
come
in
and
see
you
in
this
condition
you
would
make
her
cry
again
having
raised
himself
a
little
on
the
cushions
in
the
first
place
why
do
you
call
me
georges
you
know
that
i
do
not
like
it
but
i
can
not
call
you
gaston
call
me
for
short
naughty
girl
oh
i
could
not
i
could
never
do
that
then
he
had
sighed
is
it
not
curious
are
you
then
still
a
poor
little
slave
then
he
had
lapsed
into
silence
and
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
off
half
in
enervation
half
in
silence
which
was
also
an
enervation
and
more
painful
in
the
evening
after
dinner
the
storm
at
last
broke
out
the
wind
began
to
blow
violently
the
waves
to
beat
against
the
embankment
with
a
heavy
sullen
sound
georges
would
not
go
to
bed
he
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
sleep
and
in
a
bed
sleepless
nights
are
so
long
he
on
his
long
chair
i
sitting
near
a
little
table
on
which
veiled
by
a
shade
was
burning
a
lamp
that
shed
a
soft
pink
light
about
us
we
said
nothing
although
his
eyes
were
more
brilliant
than
usual
georges
seemed
calmer
and
the
pink
reflection
from
the
lamp
heightened
his
color
and
outlined
more
clearly
in
the
light
the
features
of
his
delicate
and
charming
face
i
was
engaged
in
sewing
suddenly
he
said
to
me
leave
your
work
for
a
little
while
célestine
and
sit
beside
me
i
always
obeyed
his
desires
his
caprices
at
times
he
manifested
an
effusive
and
enthusiastic
friendship
which
i
attributed
to
gratitude
this
time
i
obeyed
as
usual
nearer
still
nearer
he
exclaimed
then
now
give
me
your
hand
without
the
slightest
mistrust
i
allowed
him
to
take
my
hand
which
he
caressed
how
pretty
your
hand
is
and
how
pretty
your
eyes
are
and
how
pretty
you
are
altogether
altogether
altogether
he
had
often
spoken
to
me
of
my
kindness
but
never
had
he
told
me
that
i
was
pretty
at
least
he
had
never
told
me
so
with
such
an
air
surprised
and
in
reality
charmed
by
these
words
which
he
uttered
in
a
grave
and
somewhat
gasping
voice
i
instinctively
drew
back
no
no
do
not
go
away
stay
near
me
close
to
me
you
can
not
know
how
much
good
it
does
me
to
have
you
near
me
how
it
warms
me
see
i
am
no
longer
nervous
agitated
i
am
no
longer
sick
i
am
content
happy
very
happy
and
having
chastely
placed
his
arm
about
my
waist
he
obliged
me
to
sit
down
beside
him
on
the
long
chair
and
he
asked
are
you
uncomfortable
so
i
was
not
reassured
in
his
eyes
burned
a
fire
more
ardent
than
ever
his
voice
trembled
more
with
that
trembling
which
i
know
oh
yes
how
i
know
it
that
trembling
which
is
given
to
the
voice
of
all
men
by
the
violent
desire
of
love
i
was
very
much
moved
and
i
was
very
cowardly
my
head
was
whirling
a
little
but
firmly
resolved
to
defend
myself
against
him
and
especially
to
energetically
defend
him
against
himself
i
answered
in
a
childish
way
yes
monsieur
georges
i
am
very
uncomfortable
let
me
get
up
his
arm
did
not
leave
my
waist
no
no
i
beg
of
you
be
nice
and
in
a
tone
the
coaxing
gentleness
of
which
i
can
not
describe
he
added
you
are
very
timid
what
are
you
afraid
of
then
at
the
same
time
he
approached
his
face
to
mine
and
i
felt
his
warm
breath
with
its
insipid
odor
something
like
an
incense
of
death
my
heart
seized
with
an
inexpressible
anguish
i
cried
monsieur
georges
oh
monsieur
georges
let
me
go
you
will
make
yourself
sick
i
beg
of
you
let
me
go
i
did
not
dare
to
struggle
because
of
his
weakness
out
of
respect
for
the
fragility
of
his
members
i
simply
tried
and
how
carefully
to
put
away
his
hand
which
awkward
timid
trembling
was
trying
to
unhook
my
waist
and
i
repeated
let
me
go
you
are
behaving
very
badly
monsieur
georges
let
me
go
his
effort
to
hold
me
against
him
had
tired
him
his
embrace
soon
weakened
for
a
few
seconds
he
breathed
with
greater
difficulty
and
then
a
dry
cough
shook
his
chest
you
see
monsieur
georges
i
said
to
him
with
all
the
gentleness
of
a
maternal
reproach
you
are
wilfully
making
yourself
sick
you
will
listen
to
nothing
and
all
will
have
to
be
begun
over
again
great
progress
we
shall
make
in
this
way
be
good
i
beg
of
you
and
if
you
were
very
nice
do
you
know
what
you
would
do
you
would
go
to
bed
directly
he
withdrew
his
hand
stretched
out
on
the
long
chair
and
as
i
replaced
beneath
his
head
the
cushions
that
had
slipped
down
he
sadly
sighed
after
all
you
are
right
i
ask
your
pardon
you
have
not
to
ask
my
pardon
monsieur
georges
you
have
to
be
quiet
yes
yes
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
in
the
ceiling
where
the
lamp
made
a
circle
of
moving
light
i
was
a
little
mad
to
have
dreamed
for
a
moment
that
you
could
love
me
me
who
have
never
had
love
me
who
have
never
had
anything
but
suffering
why
should
you
love
me
it
would
cure
me
to
love
you
since
you
have
been
here
beside
me
and
since
the
beginning
of
my
desire
for
you
since
you
have
been
here
with
your
youth
and
your
freshness
and
your
eyes
and
your
hands
your
little
silky
hands
whose
attentions
are
the
gentlest
of
caresses
since
the
time
i
began
to
dream
of
you
alone
i
have
felt
boiling
within
me
in
my
soul
and
in
my
body
new
vigor
a
wholly
unknown
life
that
is
to
say
i
did
feel
that
for
now
in
short
what
do
you
expect
i
was
mad
and
you
you
are
right
i
was
greatly
embarrassed
i
knew
not
what
to
say
i
knew
not
what
to
do
powerful
and
opposite
feelings
pulled
me
in
all
directions
an
impulse
rushed
me
toward
him
a
sacred
duty
held
me
back
and
in
a
silly
fashion
because
i
was
not
sincere
because
i
could
not
be
sincere
in
a
struggle
where
these
desires
and
this
duty
combatted
with
equal
force
i
stammered
monsieur
georges
be
good
do
not
think
of
these
ugly
things
it
makes
you
sick
come
monsieur
georges
be
very
nice
but
he
repeated
why
should
you
love
me
truly
you
are
right
in
not
loving
me
you
think
me
you
fear
to
poison
your
mouth
with
the
poisons
of
mine
you
are
afraid
of
contracting
my
disease
the
disease
of
which
i
am
dying
am
i
not
from
one
of
my
kisses
you
are
right
the
cruel
injustice
of
these
words
struck
me
to
the
heart
do
not
say
that
monsieur
georges
i
cried
wildly
what
you
say
is
horrible
and
wicked
and
you
really
give
me
too
much
pain
too
much
pain
i
seized
his
hands
they
were
moist
and
burning
i
bent
over
him
his
breath
had
the
raucous
ardor
of
a
forge
it
is
horrible
horrible
he
continued
a
kiss
from
you
that
meant
my
resurrection
my
complete
restoration
to
life
oh
you
have
believed
seriously
in
your
baths
in
your
port
wine
in
your
poor
little
one
it
is
in
your
love
that
i
have
bathed
it
is
the
wine
of
your
love
that
i
have
drunk
it
is
the
revulsion
of
your
life
that
has
set
a
new
blood
flowing
beneath
my
skin
it
is
because
i
have
so
hoped
and
longed
and
waited
for
your
kiss
that
i
have
begun
to
live
again
to
be
strong
for
i
am
strong
now
but
i
am
not
angry
with
you
for
refusing
me
you
are
right
in
refusing
i
understand
i
understand
you
are
a
timid
little
soul
without
courage
a
little
bird
that
sings
on
one
branch
and
then
on
another
and
flies
away
at
the
slightest
noise
frroutt
these
are
frightful
things
which
you
are
saying
monsieur
georges
he
still
went
on
while
i
wrung
my
hands
why
are
they
frightful
no
indeed
they
are
not
frightful
they
are
true
you
think
me
sick
you
think
that
one
is
sick
when
one
has
love
you
do
not
know
that
love
is
life
eternal
life
yes
yes
i
understand
since
your
kiss
which
is
life
for
me
might
you
fancy
be
death
for
you
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
i
could
not
listen
further
was
it
pity
was
it
the
bleeding
reproach
and
bitter
challenge
that
these
atrocious
and
sacrilegious
words
conveyed
was
it
simply
the
impulsive
and
savage
love
that
suddenly
took
possession
of
me
i
do
not
know
perhaps
it
was
all
of
these
together
what
i
know
is
that
i
allowed
myself
to
fall
like
a
mass
on
the
long
chair
and
that
lifting
in
my
hands
the
child
adorable
head
i
wildly
cried
there
naughty
boy
see
how
afraid
i
am
of
you
see
then
how
afraid
i
am
of
you
i
glued
my
lips
to
his
lips
i
pressed
my
teeth
against
his
with
such
quivering
fury
that
my
tongue
seemed
to
penetrate
the
deepest
sores
of
his
chest
to
lick
them
to
drink
from
them
to
draw
out
of
them
all
the
poisoned
blood
and
all
the
mortal
pus
his
arms
opened
and
closed
again
about
me
in
an
embrace
and
what
was
to
happen
happened
well
no
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
surer
i
am
that
what
threw
me
into
georges
arms
what
fastened
my
lips
to
his
was
first
and
only
an
imperative
spontaneous
movement
of
protest
against
the
base
sentiments
that
georges
through
strategy
perhaps
attributed
to
my
refusal
it
was
above
all
an
act
of
fervent
disinterested
and
very
pure
piety
which
meant
to
say
no
i
do
not
think
that
you
are
sick
no
you
are
not
sick
and
the
proof
is
that
i
do
not
hesitate
to
mingle
my
breath
with
yours
to
breathe
it
to
drink
it
in
to
impregnate
my
lungs
with
it
to
saturate
with
it
all
my
flesh
and
even
though
you
were
really
sick
even
though
your
disease
were
contagious
and
fatal
to
any
one
approaching
it
i
do
not
wish
you
to
entertain
concerning
me
this
monstrous
idea
that
i
am
afraid
of
contracting
it
of
suffering
from
it
and
of
dying
from
it
nor
had
i
foreseen
and
calculated
the
inevitable
result
of
this
kiss
and
that
i
would
not
have
the
strength
once
in
my
friend
arms
once
my
lips
on
his
to
tear
myself
from
this
embrace
and
put
away
this
kiss
but
there
it
is
you
see
when
a
man
holds
me
in
his
arms
my
skin
at
once
begins
to
burn
and
my
head
to
turn
and
turn
i
become
drunk
i
become
mad
i
become
savage
i
have
no
other
will
than
that
of
my
desire
i
see
only
him
i
think
only
of
him
and
i
suffer
myself
to
be
led
by
him
docile
and
terrible
even
to
crime
oh
that
first
kiss
of
georges
his
awkward
and
delicious
caresses
the
passionate
artlessness
of
all
his
movements
and
the
wondering
expression
of
his
eyes
in
presence
of
the
mystery
at
last
unveiled
of
woman
and
of
love
but
the
intoxication
passed
when
i
saw
the
poor
and
fragile
child
panting
almost
swooning
in
my
arms
i
felt
a
frightful
remorse
at
least
the
terrifying
sensation
that
i
had
just
committed
a
murder
monsieur
georges
monsieur
georges
i
have
made
you
oh
poor
little
one
but
he
with
what
feline
tender
and
trusting
grace
with
what
dazzled
gratitude
he
rolled
against
me
as
if
in
search
of
protection
and
he
said
to
me
his
eyes
filled
with
ecstasy
i
am
happy
now
i
can
die
and
as
i
cursed
my
weakness
in
my
despair
he
repeated
i
am
happy
oh
stay
with
me
do
not
leave
me
it
seems
to
me
you
see
that
if
i
were
left
alone
i
could
not
endure
the
violence
of
my
happiness
although
it
is
so
sweet
while
i
was
helping
him
to
go
to
bed
he
had
a
fit
of
coughing
fortunately
it
was
short
but
short
though
it
was
it
lacerated
my
soul
after
having
relieved
and
cured
him
was
i
going
to
kill
him
now
i
thought
that
i
should
be
unable
to
keep
the
tears
back
and
i
detested
myself
it
is
nothing
it
is
nothing
he
exclaimed
with
a
smile
you
must
not
grieve
since
i
am
so
happy
and
besides
i
am
not
sick
i
am
not
sick
you
will
see
how
soundly
i
shall
sleep
against
you
for
i
wish
to
sleep
upon
your
breast
as
if
i
were
your
little
child
my
head
upon
your
breast
and
if
your
grandmother
should
ring
for
me
monsieur
georges
oh
no
oh
no
grandmother
will
not
ring
i
wish
to
sleep
against
you
during
the
fortnight
that
followed
that
memorable
night
that
delicious
and
tragic
night
a
sort
of
fury
took
possession
of
us
mingling
our
kisses
our
bodies
our
souls
in
an
embrace
in
an
endless
possession
we
were
in
haste
to
enjoy
in
compensation
for
the
lost
past
we
desired
to
live
almost
without
rest
the
love
of
which
we
felt
that
death
now
near
at
hand
was
to
be
the
climax
a
sudden
change
had
taken
place
in
me
in
my
kiss
there
was
something
sinister
and
madly
criminal
knowing
that
i
was
killing
georges
i
was
furiously
bent
upon
killing
myself
also
of
the
same
joy
and
of
the
same
disease
deliberately
i
sacrificed
his
life
and
mine
with
a
wild
and
bitter
exaltation
i
breathed
and
drank
in
death
all
the
death
from
his
mouth
and
i
besmeared
my
lips
with
his
poison
once
when
he
was
coughing
seized
in
my
arms
with
a
more
violent
attack
than
usual
i
saw
foaming
on
his
lips
a
huge
and
unclean
clot
of
phlegm
give
give
give
and
i
swallowed
the
phlegm
with
murderous
avidity
as
i
would
have
swallowed
a
cordial
monsieur
georges
was
not
slow
in
wasting
away
his
crises
became
more
frequent
more
painful
he
spat
blood
and
had
long
periods
of
swooning
during
which
he
was
thought
to
be
dead
his
body
grew
thin
hollow
and
emaciated
until
it
really
resembled
an
anatomical
specimen
and
the
joy
that
had
regained
possession
of
the
house
changed
very
speedily
into
dismal
sorrow
the
grandmother
began
again
to
pass
her
days
in
the
crying
praying
on
the
alert
for
sounds
and
with
her
ear
glued
to
the
door
that
separated
her
from
her
child
undergoing
the
frightful
and
continual
anguish
of
hearing
a
cry
a
rattle
a
sigh
the
last
the
end
of
everything
dear
and
still
living
that
was
left
to
her
here
below
when
i
went
out
of
the
room
she
followed
me
step
by
step
about
the
house
wailing
why
my
god
why
and
what
then
has
happened
she
said
to
me
also
you
are
killing
yourself
my
poor
little
one
but
you
can
not
pass
all
your
nights
by
georges
side
i
am
going
to
send
for
a
sister
to
take
your
place
but
i
refused
and
she
cherished
me
all
the
more
for
this
refusal
seeming
to
think
that
having
already
worked
one
miracle
i
could
now
work
another
is
it
not
frightful
i
was
her
last
hope
as
for
the
doctors
summoned
from
paris
they
were
astonished
at
the
progress
of
the
disease
and
that
it
had
worked
such
ravages
in
so
short
a
time
not
for
a
moment
did
they
or
anyone
suspect
the
terrible
truth
their
intervention
was
confined
to
the
prescribing
of
quieting
potions
monsieur
georges
alone
remained
gay
happy
steadily
gay
unalterably
happy
not
only
did
he
never
complain
but
his
soul
continually
poured
itself
out
in
effusions
of
gratitude
he
spoke
only
to
express
his
joy
sometimes
at
night
in
his
room
after
terrible
crises
he
said
to
me
i
am
happy
why
grieve
and
weep
your
tears
do
something
to
spoil
my
joy
the
ardent
joy
with
which
i
am
filled
oh
i
assure
you
that
death
is
not
a
high
price
to
pay
for
the
superhuman
happiness
which
you
have
given
me
i
was
lost
death
was
in
me
nothing
could
prevent
it
from
being
in
me
you
have
rendered
it
radiant
and
pleasant
then
do
not
weep
dear
little
one
i
adore
you
and
i
thank
you
my
fever
of
destruction
had
entirely
vanished
now
i
lived
in
a
condition
of
frightful
disgust
with
myself
in
an
unspeakable
horror
of
my
crime
of
my
murder
there
was
nothing
left
me
but
the
hope
the
consolation
or
the
excuse
that
i
had
contracted
my
friend
disease
and
would
die
with
him
and
at
the
same
time
and
what
was
to
happen
happened
we
were
then
in
the
month
of
october
precisely
the
sixth
of
october
the
autumn
having
remained
mild
and
warm
that
year
the
doctors
had
counselled
a
prolongation
of
the
patient
stay
at
the
seaside
pending
the
time
when
he
could
be
taken
to
the
south
all
day
long
on
that
sixth
of
october
monsieur
georges
had
been
quieter
i
had
opened
wide
the
large
in
his
room
and
there
lying
on
his
long
chair
beside
the
window
protected
from
the
air
by
warm
coverings
he
had
breathed
for
at
least
four
hours
and
deliciously
the
iodic
emanations
from
the
offing
the
sun
the
good
sea
odors
the
deserted
beach
now
occupied
again
by
the
delighted
him
never
had
i
seen
him
gayer
and
this
gaiety
on
his
emaciated
face
where
the
skin
growing
thinner
from
week
to
week
covered
the
bones
like
a
transparent
film
had
something
funereal
about
it
and
so
painful
to
witness
that
several
times
i
had
to
leave
the
room
in
order
to
weep
freely
he
refused
to
let
me
read
poetry
to
him
when
i
opened
the
book
he
said
no
you
are
my
poem
you
are
all
my
poems
and
far
the
most
beautiful
of
all
he
was
forbidden
to
talk
the
slightest
conversation
fatigued
him
and
often
brought
on
a
fit
of
coughing
moreover
he
had
hardly
strength
enough
to
talk
what
was
left
to
him
of
life
of
thought
of
will
to
express
of
sensibility
was
concentrated
in
his
gaze
which
had
become
a
glowing
fireplace
in
which
the
soul
continually
kindled
a
flame
of
surprising
and
supernatural
intensity
that
evening
the
evening
of
the
sixth
of
october
he
seemed
no
longer
to
be
suffering
oh
i
see
him
still
stretched
upon
his
bed
his
head
high
upon
his
pillow
his
long
thin
hands
playing
tranquilly
with
the
blue
fringe
of
the
curtain
his
lips
smiling
at
me
and
his
eyes
which
in
the
shade
of
the
bed
shone
and
burned
like
a
lamp
following
all
my
goings
and
comings
they
had
placed
a
couch
in
the
room
for
me
a
nurse
couch
and
oh
irony
in
order
doubtless
to
spare
his
modesty
and
mine
a
screen
behind
which
i
could
undress
but
often
i
did
not
lie
upon
the
couch
monsieur
georges
wanted
me
always
by
his
side
he
was
really
comfortable
really
happy
only
when
i
was
near
him
after
having
slept
two
hours
almost
peacefully
he
awoke
toward
midnight
he
was
a
little
feverish
the
spots
at
the
points
of
his
were
a
little
redder
seeing
me
sitting
at
the
head
of
his
bed
my
cheeks
damp
with
tears
he
said
to
me
in
a
tone
of
gentle
reproach
what
weeping
again
you
wish
then
to
make
me
sad
and
to
give
me
pain
why
do
you
not
lie
down
come
and
lie
down
beside
me
i
cried
shaken
by
sobs
ah
monsieur
georges
do
you
wish
me
then
to
kill
you
do
you
wish
me
to
suffer
all
my
life
from
remorse
at
having
killed
you
all
my
life
i
had
already
forgotten
that
i
wanted
to
die
with
him
to
die
of
him
to
die
as
he
died
monsieur
georges
monsieur
georges
have
pity
on
me
i
implore
you
but
his
lips
were
on
my
lips
death
was
on
my
lips
be
still
he
exclaimed
gasping
i
have
never
loved
you
so
much
as
suddenly
his
arms
relaxed
and
fell
back
inert
upon
the
bed
his
lips
abandoned
mine
and
from
his
mouth
turned
upward
there
came
a
cry
of
distress
and
then
a
flow
of
hot
blood
that
spattered
my
face
with
a
bound
i
was
out
of
bed
a
mirror
opposite
revealed
my
image
red
and
bloody
i
was
mad
and
running
about
the
room
in
bewilderment
it
was
my
impulse
to
call
for
aid
but
the
instinct
of
the
fear
of
responsibilities
of
the
revelation
of
my
crime
and
i
know
not
what
else
that
was
cowardly
and
calculating
closed
my
mouth
and
held
me
back
at
the
edge
of
the
abyss
over
which
my
reason
was
tottering
very
clearly
and
very
speedily
i
realized
that
it
would
not
do
for
any
one
to
enter
the
room
in
its
present
condition
o
human
misery
there
was
something
more
spontaneous
than
my
grief
more
powerful
than
my
fear
it
was
my
ignoble
prudence
and
my
base
calculations
in
my
terror
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
open
the
door
of
the
and
then
the
door
of
the
and
listen
not
a
sound
everybody
in
the
house
was
asleep
then
i
returned
to
the
bedside
i
raised
georges
body
as
light
as
a
feather
in
my
arms
i
lifted
up
his
head
maintaining
it
in
an
upright
position
in
my
hands
the
blood
continued
to
flow
from
his
mouth
in
pitchy
filaments
i
heard
his
chest
discharging
itself
through
his
throat
with
the
sound
of
an
emptying
bottle
his
eyes
turned
up
showed
nothing
but
their
reddish
globes
between
the
swollen
eyelids
georges
georges
georges
georges
did
not
answer
these
calls
and
cries
he
did
not
hear
them
he
heard
nothing
more
of
the
cries
and
calls
of
earth
georges
georges
georges
i
let
go
his
body
his
body
sank
upon
the
bed
i
let
go
his
head
his
head
fell
back
heavily
upon
the
pillow
i
placed
my
hand
upon
his
heart
his
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
georges
georges
georges
the
horror
of
this
silence
of
these
mute
lips
of
this
corpse
red
and
motionless
and
of
myself
was
too
much
for
me
and
crushed
with
grief
crushed
with
the
frightful
necessity
of
restraining
my
grief
i
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
swoon
how
many
minutes
did
this
swoon
last
or
how
many
centuries
i
do
not
know
on
recovering
consciousness
one
torturing
thought
dominated
all
others
that
of
removing
every
accusing
sign
i
washed
my
face
i
redressed
myself
and
yes
i
had
the
frightful
courage
i
put
the
bed
and
the
room
to
rights
and
when
that
was
done
i
awoke
the
house
i
cried
the
terrible
news
through
the
house
oh
that
night
that
night
i
suffered
all
the
tortures
that
hell
contains
and
this
night
here
at
the
priory
reminds
me
of
it
the
storm
is
raging
as
it
raged
there
the
night
when
i
began
my
work
of
destruction
on
that
poor
flesh
and
the
roaring
of
the
wind
through
the
trees
in
the
garden
sounds
to
me
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
against
the
embankment
of
the
houlgate
villa
upon
our
return
to
paris
after
georges
funeral
i
did
not
wish
to
remain
in
the
poor
grandmother
service
in
spite
of
her
repeated
entreaties
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
away
that
i
might
see
no
more
of
that
tearful
face
that
i
might
no
longer
hear
the
sobs
that
lacerated
my
heart
and
above
all
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
from
her
gratitude
from
the
necessity
which
she
felt
in
her
doting
distress
of
continually
thanking
me
for
my
devotion
for
my
heroism
of
calling
me
her
daughter
her
dear
little
daughter
and
of
embracing
me
with
madly
effusive
tenderness
many
times
during
the
fortnight
in
which
i
consented
to
call
upon
her
in
obedience
to
her
request
i
had
an
intense
desire
to
confess
to
accuse
myself
to
tell
her
everything
that
was
lying
so
heavily
on
my
soul
and
often
stifling
me
but
what
would
have
been
the
use
would
it
have
given
her
any
relief
whatever
it
would
simply
have
added
a
more
bitter
affliction
to
her
other
afflictions
and
the
horrible
thought
and
the
inexpiable
remorse
that
but
for
me
her
dear
child
perhaps
would
not
be
dead
and
then
i
must
confess
that
i
had
not
the
courage
i
left
her
house
with
my
secret
worshipped
by
her
as
if
i
were
a
saint
overwhelmed
with
rich
presents
and
with
love
now
on
the
very
day
of
my
departure
as
i
was
coming
back
from
mme
i
met
in
the
a
former
comrade
a
valet
with
whom
i
had
served
for
six
months
in
the
same
house
it
was
fully
two
years
since
i
had
seen
him
after
our
first
greetings
i
learned
that
he
as
well
as
i
was
looking
for
a
place
only
having
for
the
moment
some
extra
jobs
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
find
one
this
jolly
célestine
he
exclaimed
happy
at
seeing
me
again
as
astonishing
as
ever
he
was
a
good
fellow
gay
full
of
fun
and
fond
of
a
good
time
he
proposed
suppose
we
dine
together
eh
i
needed
to
divert
myself
to
drive
far
away
from
me
a
multitude
of
sad
images
a
multitude
of
obsessing
thoughts
i
accepted
good
he
exclaimed
he
took
my
arm
and
led
me
to
a
in
the
rue
cambon
his
heavy
gaiety
his
coarse
jokes
his
vulgar
obscenity
i
keenly
appreciated
they
did
not
shock
me
on
the
contrary
i
felt
a
certain
rascally
joy
a
sort
of
crapulous
security
as
if
i
were
resuming
a
lost
habit
to
tell
the
truth
i
recognized
myself
i
recognized
my
own
life
and
my
own
soul
in
those
dissipated
eyelids
in
that
smooth
face
in
those
shaven
lips
which
betray
the
same
servile
grimace
the
same
furrow
of
falsehood
the
same
taste
for
passional
filth
in
the
actor
the
judge
and
the
valet
after
dinner
we
strolled
for
a
time
on
the
boulevards
then
he
took
me
to
see
a
cinematograph
exhibition
my
will
was
a
little
weak
from
having
drunk
too
much
saumur
wine
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
as
the
french
army
was
marching
across
the
illuminated
screen
amid
the
applause
of
the
spectators
he
caught
me
about
the
waist
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
the
back
of
my
neck
which
came
near
loosening
my
hair
you
are
astonishing
he
whispered
oh
how
good
you
smell
he
accompanied
me
to
my
hotel
and
we
stood
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
sidewalk
silent
and
a
little
stupid
he
was
tapping
his
shoes
with
the
end
of
his
cane
i
with
head
lowered
my
elbows
pressed
closely
against
my
body
and
my
hands
in
my
muff
was
crushing
a
bit
of
beneath
my
feet
well
revoir
i
said
to
him
oh
no
he
exclaimed
let
me
go
up
with
you
come
célestine
i
defended
myself
in
an
uncertain
fashion
for
the
sake
of
form
he
insisted
come
what
is
the
matter
with
you
heart
troubles
now
is
the
very
time
he
followed
me
in
this
hotel
they
did
not
look
too
closely
at
the
guests
who
returned
at
night
with
its
dark
and
narrow
staircase
its
slimy
banister
its
vile
atmosphere
its
fetid
odors
it
seemed
like
a
house
for
the
accommodation
of
transients
and
my
companion
coughed
to
give
himself
assurance
and
i
with
my
soul
full
of
disgust
reflected
oh
indeed
this
is
not
equal
to
the
houlgate
villas
or
to
the
warm
and
mansions
in
the
rue
lincoln
what
a
hussy
one
is
sometimes
oh
misery
me
and
my
life
began
again
with
its
ups
and
downs
its
changes
of
front
its
as
quickly
ended
as
begun
and
its
sudden
leaps
from
opulent
interiors
into
the
street
just
as
of
old
singular
thing
i
who
in
my
amorous
exaltation
my
ardent
thirst
for
sacrifice
had
sincerely
and
passionately
wished
to
die
was
haunted
for
long
months
by
the
fear
of
having
contracted
monsieur
disease
from
his
kisses
the
slightest
indisposition
the
most
fleeting
pain
filled
me
with
real
terror
often
at
night
i
awoke
with
mad
frights
and
icy
sweats
i
felt
of
my
chest
where
by
suggestion
i
suffered
from
pains
and
lacerations
i
examined
the
discharges
from
my
throat
in
which
i
saw
red
streaks
and
i
gave
myself
a
fever
by
frequent
counting
of
my
pulse
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
looked
in
the
glass
that
my
eyes
were
growing
hollow
and
that
my
cheeks
were
growing
pinker
with
that
mortal
pink
that
colored
monsieur
face
one
night
as
i
was
leaving
a
public
ball
i
took
cold
and
i
coughed
for
a
week
i
thought
that
it
was
all
over
with
me
i
covered
my
back
with
plasters
and
swallowed
all
sorts
of
queer
medicines
i
even
sent
a
pious
offering
to
saint
anthony
of
padua
then
as
in
spite
of
my
fear
my
health
remained
good
showing
that
i
had
equal
power
to
endure
the
fatigues
of
toil
and
of
pleasure
it
all
passed
away
last
year
on
the
sixth
of
october
i
went
to
lay
flowers
on
georges
grave
as
i
had
done
every
year
when
that
sad
date
came
round
he
was
buried
in
the
montmartre
cemetery
in
the
main
path
i
saw
a
few
steps
ahead
of
me
the
poor
grandmother
oh
how
old
she
was
and
how
old
also
were
the
two
old
servants
who
accompanied
her
arched
bent
tottering
she
walked
heavily
sustained
at
the
by
her
two
old
servants
as
arched
as
bent
as
tottering
as
their
mistress
a
porter
followed
them
carrying
a
large
bunch
of
red
and
white
roses
i
slackened
my
pace
not
wishing
to
pass
them
and
be
recognized
hidden
behind
the
wall
of
a
high
monument
i
waited
until
the
poor
and
sorrowful
old
woman
had
placed
her
flowers
told
her
beads
and
dropped
her
tears
upon
her
grandson
grave
they
came
back
with
the
same
feeble
steps
through
the
smaller
path
brushing
against
the
wall
of
the
vault
on
the
other
side
of
which
i
was
hiding
i
concealed
myself
still
more
that
i
might
not
see
them
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
my
remorse
the
phantoms
of
my
remorse
that
were
filing
by
me
would
she
have
recognized
me
ah
i
do
not
think
so
they
walked
without
looking
at
anything
without
seeing
even
the
ground
about
them
their
eyes
had
the
fixity
of
the
eyes
of
the
blind
their
lips
moved
and
moved
and
not
a
word
came
from
them
one
would
have
said
that
they
were
three
old
dead
souls
lost
in
the
labyrinth
of
the
cemetery
and
looking
for
their
graves
i
saw
again
that
tragic
night
and
my
red
face
and
the
blood
flowing
from
georges
mouth
it
sent
a
shiver
to
my
heart
at
last
they
disappeared
where
are
they
those
three
lamentable
shades
perhaps
they
are
a
little
more
dead
perhaps
they
are
dead
quite
after
having
wandered
on
for
days
and
nights
perhaps
they
have
found
the
hole
of
silence
and
of
rest
of
which
they
were
in
search
all
the
same
it
is
a
queer
idea
that
the
unfortunate
grandmother
had
in
choosing
me
as
a
nurse
for
a
young
and
pretty
boy
like
monsieur
georges
and
really
when
i
think
of
the
matter
again
and
realize
that
she
never
suspected
anything
that
she
never
saw
anything
that
she
never
understood
anything
this
seems
to
me
the
most
astonishing
feature
of
the
matter
ah
one
can
say
it
now
they
were
not
very
sharp
the
three
of
them
they
had
an
abundance
of
confidence
i
have
seen
captain
mauger
again
over
the
hedge
crouching
before
a
bed
he
was
transplanting
pansies
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
left
his
work
and
came
to
the
hedge
to
talk
he
is
no
longer
angry
with
me
for
the
murder
of
his
ferret
he
even
seems
very
gay
bursting
with
laughter
he
confides
to
me
that
this
morning
he
has
wrung
the
neck
of
the
lanlaires
white
cat
probably
the
cat
avenges
the
ferret
it
is
the
tenth
that
i
have
gently
killed
for
them
he
cries
with
ferocious
joy
slapping
his
thigh
and
then
rubbing
his
grimy
hands
ah
the
dirty
thing
will
scratch
no
more
compost
from
my
it
will
no
longer
ravage
my
the
camel
and
if
i
could
also
wring
the
necks
of
your
lanlaire
and
his
female
oh
the
pigs
oh
oh
oh
that
an
idea
this
idea
makes
him
twist
with
laughter
for
a
moment
and
suddenly
his
eyes
sparkling
with
a
stealthy
malice
he
asks
why
do
you
put
some
in
their
bed
the
dirty
creatures
oh
i
would
give
you
a
package
of
it
for
the
purpose
that
an
idea
then
by
the
way
you
know
kléber
my
little
ferret
yes
well
well
i
ate
him
alas
alas
he
was
not
very
good
was
he
alas
he
tasted
like
bad
rabbit
and
that
was
all
the
funeral
sermon
that
the
poor
animal
got
the
captain
tells
me
also
that
a
week
or
two
ago
he
caught
a
under
a
he
is
engaged
in
taming
him
he
calls
him
bourbaki
ah
that
an
idea
an
intelligent
comical
extraordinary
beast
that
eats
everything
yes
indeed
he
exclaims
in
the
same
day
this
confounded
has
eaten
beefsteak
mutton
stew
salt
bacon
gruyère
cheese
and
preserves
he
is
astonishing
it
is
impossible
to
satisfy
him
he
is
like
me
he
eats
everything
just
then
the
little
domestic
passes
the
path
with
a
wheelbarrow
full
of
stones
old
and
a
heap
of
which
he
is
carrying
to
the
come
here
calls
the
captain
and
as
in
answer
to
his
question
i
tell
him
that
monsieur
has
gone
hunting
that
madame
has
gone
to
town
and
that
joseph
has
gone
on
an
errand
he
takes
from
the
wheelbarrow
each
of
the
stones
each
bit
of
the
and
one
after
another
throws
them
into
the
garden
crying
in
a
loud
voice
there
pig
take
that
you
wretch
the
stones
fly
the
bits
of
fall
upon
a
bed
where
joseph
the
day
before
had
planted
peas
take
that
and
this
too
and
here
is
another
in
the
bargain
the
bed
soon
covered
with
becomes
a
confused
heap
the
captain
joy
finds
expression
in
a
sort
of
hooting
and
disorderly
gestures
then
turning
up
his
old
grey
moustache
he
says
to
me
with
a
triumphant
and
rakish
air
mademoiselle
célestine
you
are
a
fine
girl
for
sure
you
must
come
and
see
me
when
rose
is
no
longer
here
eh
ah
that
an
idea
well
indeed
he
has
no
cheek
viii
at
last
i
have
received
a
letter
from
monsieur
jean
it
is
very
dry
this
letter
from
reading
it
one
would
think
that
there
never
had
been
any
intimacy
between
us
not
a
word
of
friendship
not
a
particle
of
tenderness
not
a
recollection
he
tells
me
only
of
himself
if
he
is
to
be
believed
it
seems
that
jean
has
become
an
important
personage
that
is
to
be
seen
and
felt
from
the
patronizing
and
somewhat
contemptuous
air
which
he
assumes
toward
me
at
the
beginning
of
his
letter
in
short
he
writes
to
me
only
to
astonish
me
i
always
knew
that
he
was
vain
indeed
he
was
such
a
handsome
fellow
but
i
never
realized
it
so
much
as
men
can
not
stand
success
or
glory
jean
is
still
first
de
in
the
house
of
the
countess
fardin
and
at
this
moment
the
countess
is
perhaps
the
woman
in
france
to
his
capacity
of
de
jean
adds
the
of
a
participant
in
political
manifestations
and
of
royalist
conspirator
he
manifests
with
coppée
lemaitre
quesnay
de
beaurepaire
he
conspires
with
general
mercier
and
all
to
overturn
the
republic
the
other
evening
he
accompanied
coppée
to
a
meeting
of
the
patrie
française
he
strutted
on
the
platform
behind
the
great
patriot
and
held
his
overcoat
all
the
evening
for
that
matter
he
can
say
that
he
has
held
all
the
overcoats
of
all
the
great
patriots
of
this
time
that
will
count
for
something
in
his
life
another
evening
at
the
exit
of
a
dreyfusard
meeting
to
which
the
countess
had
sent
him
to
smash
the
jaws
of
the
cosmopolitans
he
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
for
having
spat
upon
these
people
without
a
country
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
death
to
the
jews
long
live
the
king
long
live
the
army
the
countess
threatened
the
government
with
an
interpellation
in
the
chamber
and
monsieur
jean
was
at
once
released
his
mistress
even
added
twenty
francs
a
month
to
his
wages
in
compensation
for
this
lofty
feat
of
arms
arthur
meyer
printed
his
name
in
the
gaulois
his
name
figures
also
opposite
the
sum
of
a
hundred
francs
in
the
libre
parole
among
the
subscribers
to
the
fund
for
a
monument
for
colonel
henry
coppée
inscribed
it
there
officially
coppée
also
made
him
an
honorary
member
of
the
patrie
française
an
astonishing
society
all
the
servants
in
the
great
houses
belong
to
it
there
are
also
counts
marquises
and
dukes
on
coming
to
breakfast
yesterday
general
mercier
said
to
jean
well
my
brave
jean
my
brave
jean
jules
guérin
in
the
has
written
under
the
heading
another
victim
of
the
sheenies
an
article
beginning
our
valiant
comrade
jean
etc
and
finally
forain
who
now
is
always
at
the
house
has
had
jean
pose
for
a
design
which
is
to
symbolize
the
soul
of
the
country
forain
thinks
that
jean
has
just
the
mug
for
that
he
receives
at
this
moment
an
astonishing
number
of
illustrious
decorations
of
serious
tips
and
of
honorary
and
extremely
flattering
distinctions
and
if
as
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
general
mercier
decides
to
summon
jean
for
the
coming
zola
trial
to
give
false
testimony
the
nature
of
which
the
staff
will
decide
upon
soon
nothing
will
be
lacking
to
complete
his
glory
this
year
in
high
society
there
is
nothing
so
fashionable
and
effective
as
false
testimony
to
be
selected
for
a
perjurer
besides
bringing
certain
and
swift
glory
is
as
good
as
winning
the
capital
prize
in
a
lottery
jean
clearly
perceives
that
he
is
making
a
greater
and
greater
sensation
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
when
in
the
evening
he
goes
to
the
café
in
the
rue
francois
to
play
pool
for
a
turkey
or
when
he
takes
the
countess
dogs
out
for
an
airing
he
is
the
object
of
universal
curiosity
and
respect
so
are
the
dogs
for
that
matter
that
is
why
in
view
of
a
celebrity
which
can
not
fail
to
spread
from
the
neighborhood
over
paris
and
from
paris
over
france
he
has
become
a
subscriber
to
a
just
as
the
countess
has
done
he
will
send
me
the
smartest
things
that
are
written
about
him
this
is
all
that
he
can
do
for
me
for
i
must
understand
that
he
has
no
time
to
attend
to
my
affairs
he
will
see
later
when
we
shall
be
in
power
he
writes
me
carelessly
everything
that
happens
to
me
is
my
fault
i
have
never
known
how
to
conduct
myself
there
has
never
been
any
sequence
in
my
ideas
i
have
wasted
the
best
places
without
profit
if
i
had
not
been
such
a
i
too
perhaps
would
be
on
the
best
terms
with
general
mercier
coppée
déroulède
and
perhaps
although
i
am
only
a
woman
i
should
see
my
name
sparkling
in
the
columns
of
the
gaulois
which
is
so
encouraging
for
all
sorts
of
domesticity
etc
to
read
this
letter
almost
made
me
cry
for
i
felt
that
monsieur
jean
is
quite
gone
from
me
and
that
i
can
no
longer
count
on
him
on
him
or
on
anybody
he
does
not
tell
me
a
word
of
my
successor
ah
i
see
her
from
here
i
see
them
from
here
both
of
them
in
the
chamber
that
i
know
so
well
kissing
and
caressing
each
other
and
making
the
round
of
the
public
balls
and
the
theatres
together
as
we
used
to
do
so
prettily
i
see
him
in
his
overcoat
returning
from
the
races
after
having
lost
his
money
and
saying
to
her
as
so
many
times
he
has
said
to
me
lend
me
your
jewels
and
your
watch
that
i
may
hang
them
up
unless
his
new
of
participant
in
political
manifestations
and
of
royalist
conspirator
has
filled
him
with
new
ambitions
and
he
has
abandoned
the
loves
of
the
servants
hall
for
the
loves
of
the
he
will
come
back
to
them
is
all
that
happens
to
me
really
my
fault
perhaps
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
a
fatality
of
which
i
have
never
been
the
mistress
has
weighed
upon
my
entire
existence
and
has
prevented
me
from
ever
staying
more
than
six
months
in
the
same
place
when
they
did
not
discharge
me
i
left
disgusted
beyond
endurance
it
is
funny
and
it
is
sad
i
have
always
been
in
a
hurry
to
be
elsewhere
i
have
always
entertained
a
mad
hope
of
those
chimerical
elsewheres
which
i
invest
with
the
vain
poesy
the
illusory
mirage
of
distances
especially
since
my
stay
at
houlgate
with
poor
georges
that
stay
has
left
me
with
a
certain
anxiety
a
certain
torturing
necessity
of
reaching
fruitlessly
after
unattainable
ideas
and
forms
i
really
believe
that
this
too
short
and
sudden
glimpse
of
a
world
which
i
had
better
never
have
known
at
all
being
unable
to
know
it
better
has
been
very
harmful
to
me
oh
how
disappointing
are
these
ways
leading
to
the
unknown
one
goes
on
and
on
and
it
is
always
the
same
thing
see
that
sparkling
horizon
yonder
it
is
blue
it
is
pink
it
is
fresh
it
is
as
light
and
luminous
as
a
dream
it
must
be
fine
to
live
there
you
approach
you
arrive
there
is
nothing
sand
pebbles
hills
as
dismal
as
walls
there
is
nothing
else
and
above
this
sand
these
pebbles
these
hills
there
is
a
gray
opaque
heavy
sky
a
sky
which
kills
the
day
and
whose
light
weeps
dirty
tears
there
is
nothing
nothing
of
that
which
one
is
looking
for
moreover
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
looking
for
and
neither
do
i
know
who
i
am
a
domestic
is
not
a
normal
being
a
social
being
he
is
an
incongruous
personage
made
up
of
pieces
and
bits
that
can
not
fit
into
one
another
that
can
only
lie
next
one
another
he
is
something
worse
a
monstrous
human
hybrid
he
is
no
longer
of
the
people
whence
he
came
neither
is
he
of
the
among
whom
he
lives
and
toward
whom
he
tends
he
has
lost
the
generous
blood
and
the
artless
strength
of
the
people
that
he
has
denied
and
has
gained
the
shameful
vices
of
the
without
having
succeeded
in
acquiring
the
means
of
satisfying
them
the
vile
sentiments
the
cowardly
fears
the
criminal
appetites
without
the
setting
and
consequently
without
the
excuse
of
wealth
with
a
soiled
soul
he
traverses
this
respectable
world
and
simply
from
having
breathed
the
mortal
odor
that
rises
from
these
putrid
sinks
he
loses
forever
the
security
of
his
mind
and
even
the
very
form
of
his
personality
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
recollections
amid
this
host
of
figures
among
whom
he
wanders
a
phantom
of
himself
he
finds
nothing
to
work
upon
but
filth
that
is
suffering
he
laughs
often
but
his
laugh
is
forced
this
laugh
does
not
come
from
joy
found
or
from
hope
realized
and
it
shows
the
bitter
grimace
of
rebellion
the
hard
and
contracted
curve
of
sarcasm
nothing
is
more
sorrowful
and
ugly
than
this
laugh
it
burns
and
withers
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
if
i
had
wept
and
then
i
do
not
know
and
then
come
what
will
but
nothing
comes
at
all
never
anything
and
i
can
not
accustom
myself
to
that
it
is
this
monotony
this
absolute
fixity
in
life
that
is
the
hardest
thing
for
me
to
endure
i
should
like
to
go
away
from
here
go
away
but
where
and
how
i
do
not
know
and
i
stay
madame
is
always
the
same
distrustful
methodical
severe
rapacious
without
an
impulse
without
a
caprice
without
a
particle
of
spontaneity
without
a
ray
of
joy
upon
her
marble
face
monsieur
has
resumed
his
habits
and
i
imagine
from
certain
sullen
airs
that
he
has
a
spite
against
me
because
of
my
severity
but
his
spites
are
not
dangerous
after
breakfast
armed
and
gaitered
he
starts
off
on
a
hunting
expedition
returns
at
night
asks
me
only
to
help
him
in
taking
off
his
boots
and
goes
to
bed
at
nine
he
is
still
awkward
comical
and
irresolute
he
is
growing
fat
how
can
people
as
rich
as
they
are
be
resigned
to
so
dismal
an
existence
sometimes
i
question
myself
regarding
monsieur
what
should
i
have
done
with
him
he
has
no
money
and
would
have
given
me
no
pleasure
and
especially
as
madame
is
not
jealous
the
terrible
thing
about
this
house
is
its
silence
i
can
not
get
used
to
it
yet
in
spite
of
myself
i
am
beginning
to
glide
to
walk
in
the
air
as
joseph
says
often
in
these
dark
alongside
these
cold
walls
i
seem
to
myself
like
a
spectre
like
a
ghost
and
i
am
stifling
in
it
all
and
i
stay
my
sole
diversion
is
to
go
on
sunday
after
mass
to
call
on
mme
gouin
the
grocer
disgust
holds
me
back
but
ennui
stronger
than
disgust
takes
me
there
there
at
least
we
are
ourselves
again
all
of
us
together
we
gossip
we
laugh
we
tell
stories
as
we
sip
our
little
cocktails
there
we
find
a
little
of
the
illusion
of
life
the
time
passes
a
few
sundays
ago
i
missed
a
little
woman
with
running
eyes
and
a
nose
whom
i
had
seen
there
previously
i
inquire
about
her
it
is
nothing
it
is
nothing
said
the
grocer
in
a
tone
to
which
she
tried
to
impart
a
certain
mystery
she
is
sick
then
yes
but
it
is
nothing
in
two
days
it
will
be
all
gone
and
rose
looks
at
me
with
confirmatory
eyes
which
seem
to
say
ah
you
see
this
is
a
very
skilful
woman
i
have
learned
at
the
grocer
that
a
party
of
hunters
found
yesterday
in
the
forest
of
raillon
among
the
briers
and
dead
leaves
the
body
of
a
little
girl
horribly
outraged
it
seems
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
she
was
known
in
the
neighborhood
as
the
little
claire
she
was
a
little
bit
simple
but
sweet
and
pretty
and
she
was
not
twelve
years
old
a
rich
windfall
as
you
can
imagine
for
a
place
like
the
grocer
shop
where
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
telling
the
same
stories
week
after
week
consequently
the
tongues
rattled
famously
according
to
rose
always
better
informed
than
the
others
the
little
claire
had
been
cut
open
with
a
knife
and
her
intestines
were
protruding
through
the
wound
her
neck
and
throat
still
bore
visible
marks
of
strangling
fingers
there
was
still
to
be
seen
in
the
short
heather
the
trampled
and
trodden
spot
where
the
crime
had
been
committed
it
must
have
happened
at
least
a
week
ago
for
the
body
was
almost
entirely
decomposed
the
assembled
domestics
relate
a
heap
of
things
they
remember
that
the
little
claire
was
always
in
the
woods
in
the
spring
she
gathered
there
jonquils
and
lilies
of
the
valley
and
anemones
of
which
she
made
pretty
bouquets
for
the
ladies
of
the
town
she
also
went
there
to
look
for
morels
which
she
sold
on
sunday
at
the
market
in
summer
there
were
mushrooms
of
all
sorts
and
other
flowers
but
at
this
time
of
year
why
did
she
go
to
the
woods
where
there
was
nothing
left
to
pick
one
says
discreetly
why
had
the
father
shown
no
anxiety
regarding
the
disappearance
perhaps
he
did
it
himself
to
which
another
no
less
discreetly
replies
but
if
he
had
wanted
to
do
it
himself
he
had
no
need
to
take
his
daughter
to
the
woods
come
now
mlle
rose
intervenes
it
all
looks
very
suspicious
to
me
with
knowing
airs
the
airs
of
one
who
is
in
possession
of
terrible
secrets
she
goes
on
in
a
lower
voice
a
voice
of
dangerous
confidence
oh
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
make
no
assertions
but
and
she
leaves
our
curiosity
hanging
on
this
but
what
then
what
then
they
cry
from
all
sides
with
outstretched
necks
and
open
mouths
but
i
should
not
be
astonished
if
it
were
we
are
breathless
monsieur
lanlaire
there
that
is
what
i
think
if
you
want
to
know
she
concludes
with
an
expression
of
base
and
atrocious
ferocity
several
protest
others
reserve
judgment
i
declare
that
monsieur
lanlaire
is
incapable
of
such
a
crime
and
i
cry
he
lord
jesus
oh
the
poor
man
he
would
be
too
much
afraid
but
rose
with
still
more
hatred
insists
incapable
ta
ta
ta
and
the
little
jézureau
and
valentin
little
girl
and
the
little
dougère
do
you
remember
them
incapable
it
is
not
the
same
thing
it
is
not
the
same
thing
in
their
hatred
of
monsieur
they
do
not
like
rose
go
so
far
as
to
make
a
formal
charge
of
murder
that
he
outrages
little
girls
who
consent
to
be
outraged
yes
that
is
possible
that
he
kills
them
that
is
scarcely
credible
but
rose
stormily
insists
she
froths
at
the
mouth
she
pounds
the
table
with
her
soft
fat
hands
she
cries
with
excited
gestures
do
i
not
tell
you
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
mme
gouin
who
has
been
listening
in
a
dreamy
fashion
finally
declares
in
her
meaningless
voice
oh
indeed
young
women
in
these
matters
one
can
never
tell
as
for
the
little
jézureau
it
was
a
famous
bit
of
luck
i
assure
you
that
he
did
not
kill
her
in
spite
of
the
authority
of
the
grocer
in
spite
of
the
obstinacy
of
rose
who
will
not
consent
to
change
the
subject
they
pass
in
review
one
after
another
all
the
people
in
the
neighborhood
who
could
have
done
the
deed
they
find
heaps
of
them
all
those
whom
they
detest
all
those
of
whom
they
have
any
jealousy
against
whom
they
have
any
spite
finally
the
pale
little
woman
with
the
nose
remarks
you
know
that
last
week
there
were
two
capuchins
begging
around
here
who
did
not
present
a
very
inviting
appearance
with
their
dirty
beards
may
it
not
have
been
they
a
cry
of
indignation
arises
worthy
and
pious
monks
the
good
god
holy
souls
it
is
abominable
and
as
we
take
our
departure
after
laying
everybody
under
suspicion
rose
bent
on
establishing
her
theory
repeats
do
i
not
tell
you
that
it
is
he
it
is
he
be
sure
before
the
house
i
stop
a
moment
in
the
where
joseph
is
polishing
his
harnesses
above
a
dresser
on
which
bottles
of
varnish
and
boxes
of
blacking
are
symmetrically
arranged
i
see
flaming
on
the
pine
wainscoting
the
portrait
of
drumont
to
give
him
greater
majesty
undoubtedly
joseph
has
recently
adorned
him
with
a
crown
of
laurel
opposite
the
portrait
of
the
pope
is
almost
entirely
hidden
by
a
hung
upon
a
nail
pamphlets
and
patriotic
songs
are
piled
up
on
a
shelf
and
in
a
corner
joseph
club
stands
lonely
among
the
brooms
suddenly
i
say
to
joseph
solely
from
a
motive
of
curiosity
do
you
know
joseph
that
the
little
claire
has
been
found
in
the
woods
murdered
and
outraged
at
first
joseph
can
not
suppress
a
movement
of
surprise
is
it
really
surprise
rapid
and
furtive
as
this
movement
was
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
sound
of
the
little
claire
name
a
sort
of
strange
shock
something
like
a
shudder
passed
through
him
he
recovers
very
quickly
yes
he
says
in
a
firm
voice
i
know
it
i
was
told
so
in
the
neighborhood
this
morning
now
he
is
indifferent
and
placid
he
rubs
his
harnesses
methodically
with
a
thick
black
cloth
i
admire
the
muscular
development
of
his
bare
arms
the
harmonious
and
powerful
suppleness
of
his
biceps
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
i
can
not
see
his
eyes
under
the
lowered
lids
his
eyes
so
obstinately
fixed
upon
his
work
but
i
see
his
mouth
his
large
mouth
his
enormous
jaw
the
jaw
of
a
cruel
and
sensual
beast
and
i
feel
a
sort
of
light
tremor
at
my
heart
i
ask
him
further
do
they
know
who
did
it
joseph
shrugs
his
shoulders
half
jesting
half
serious
he
answers
some
vagabonds
undoubtedly
some
dirty
sheenies
then
after
a
short
silence
puuutt
you
will
see
that
they
will
not
pinch
them
the
magistrates
are
all
sold
he
hangs
up
the
finished
harnesses
and
pointing
to
portrait
in
its
laurel
halo
he
adds
if
we
only
had
him
oh
misfortune
i
know
not
why
i
left
him
with
a
singular
feeling
of
uneasiness
in
my
soul
at
any
rate
this
story
is
going
to
give
us
something
to
talk
about
something
to
divert
us
a
little
sometimes
when
madame
is
out
and
i
can
not
stand
the
ennui
i
go
to
the
iron
fence
by
the
roadside
where
mlle
rose
comes
to
meet
me
always
on
the
watch
nothing
that
goes
on
in
our
place
escapes
her
she
sees
all
who
come
in
and
go
out
she
is
redder
fatter
flabbier
than
ever
her
lips
hang
more
than
they
did
and
she
is
more
and
more
haunted
by
obscene
ideas
every
time
that
we
meet
her
first
look
is
at
my
person
and
her
first
words
uttered
in
her
thick
voice
are
remember
my
advice
as
soon
as
you
notice
anything
go
straight
to
mme
gouin
straight
it
is
a
veritable
obsession
a
mania
a
little
annoyed
i
reply
but
why
do
you
expect
me
to
notice
anything
i
know
nobody
here
ah
she
exclaims
a
misfortune
comes
so
quickly
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
it
is
very
natural
and
there
you
are
sometimes
one
does
not
know
how
it
happens
i
have
seen
some
who
were
as
sure
as
you
are
and
then
it
happened
all
the
same
but
with
mme
gouin
one
can
rest
easy
so
expert
a
woman
is
a
real
blessing
to
a
town
why
formerly
my
dear
little
one
you
saw
nothing
but
children
around
here
the
town
was
poisoned
with
children
an
abomination
they
swarmed
in
the
streets
like
chickens
in
a
they
bawled
on
the
and
made
a
terrible
hullaballoo
one
saw
nothing
else
well
i
do
know
whether
you
have
noticed
it
but
there
are
no
more
to
be
seen
almost
none
at
all
with
a
more
slimy
smile
she
continues
not
that
the
girls
amuse
themselves
any
less
oh
heavens
no
on
the
contrary
you
never
go
out
in
the
evening
but
if
you
were
to
take
a
walk
at
nine
under
the
chestnut
trees
you
would
see
everywhere
couples
on
the
benches
kissing
and
caressing
it
is
a
very
pretty
spectacle
oh
to
me
you
know
love
is
so
pretty
i
perfectly
understand
that
one
can
not
live
without
love
yes
but
it
is
very
annoying
also
to
have
a
lot
of
children
tagging
at
one
heels
well
they
have
none
now
they
have
no
more
and
it
is
to
mme
gouin
that
they
owe
that
just
a
disagreeable
moment
to
pass
through
after
all
it
is
not
like
having
to
swallow
the
sea
in
your
place
i
would
not
hesitate
a
pretty
girl
like
you
so
distinguished
and
who
must
have
so
good
a
figure
a
child
would
be
a
murder
reassure
yourself
i
have
no
desire
to
have
one
yes
i
know
nobody
has
any
desire
to
have
one
only
but
tell
me
has
monsieur
never
made
advances
to
you
why
no
that
is
astonishing
for
he
has
a
great
reputation
for
that
not
even
that
morning
in
the
garden
i
assure
you
rose
shakes
her
head
you
are
unwilling
to
say
anything
you
distrust
me
well
that
is
your
business
only
we
know
what
we
know
peasants
pass
in
the
road
and
salute
rose
with
respect
how
do
you
do
rose
and
the
captain
is
he
well
very
well
thank
you
he
is
drawing
some
wine
just
now
pass
in
the
road
and
salute
rose
with
respect
how
do
you
do
rose
and
the
captain
always
vigorous
thank
you
you
are
very
good
the
priest
passes
in
the
road
with
a
slow
step
wagging
his
head
at
the
sight
of
rose
he
bows
smiles
closes
his
breviary
and
stops
ah
it
is
you
my
dear
child
and
the
captain
thank
you
father
things
are
going
very
nicely
the
captain
is
busy
in
the
cellar
so
much
the
better
so
much
the
better
i
hope
that
he
has
planted
some
beautiful
flowers
and
that
next
year
on
corpus
christi
day
we
shall
have
again
a
superb
street
altar
you
may
be
sure
of
it
father
all
my
friendships
to
the
captain
my
child
and
the
same
to
you
father
and
as
he
goes
away
his
breviary
again
open
revoir
au
revoir
all
that
a
parish
needs
is
parishioners
like
you
and
i
go
back
a
little
sad
a
little
discouraged
a
little
hateful
leaving
this
abominable
rose
to
enjoy
her
triumph
saluted
by
all
respected
by
all
fat
happy
hideously
happy
soon
i
am
sure
the
priest
will
place
her
in
a
niche
in
his
church
between
two
candles
with
a
nimbus
of
gold
about
her
like
a
saint
ix
joseph
puzzles
me
his
ways
are
really
mysterious
and
i
do
not
know
what
goes
on
in
this
silent
and
furious
soul
but
surely
something
extraordinary
his
look
sometimes
is
difficult
to
endure
so
difficult
that
mine
avoids
its
intimidating
fixity
he
has
a
slow
and
gliding
gait
that
frightens
me
one
would
say
that
he
was
dragging
a
ball
riveted
to
his
ankle
or
rather
the
recollection
of
a
ball
is
this
a
relic
of
a
prison
or
of
a
convent
both
perhaps
his
back
too
frightens
me
and
also
his
large
powerful
neck
tanned
by
the
sun
till
it
looks
like
old
leather
and
stiffened
with
sinews
that
stretch
and
strain
like
ropes
i
have
noticed
on
the
back
of
his
neck
a
collection
of
hard
muscles
that
stand
out
in
an
exaggerated
fashion
like
those
of
wolves
and
wild
beasts
which
have
to
carry
heavy
prey
in
their
jaws
apart
from
his
craze
which
indicates
in
joseph
a
great
violence
and
a
thirst
for
blood
he
is
rather
reserved
concerning
all
matters
it
is
even
impossible
to
know
what
he
thinks
he
has
none
of
the
swagger
and
none
of
the
professional
humility
by
which
true
domestics
are
to
be
recognized
never
a
word
of
complaint
never
the
slightest
disparagement
of
his
masters
he
respects
his
masters
without
servility
and
seems
to
be
devoted
to
them
without
ostentation
he
does
not
sulk
at
his
work
even
when
it
is
most
repulsive
he
is
ingenious
he
knows
how
to
do
everything
even
the
most
difficult
and
different
things
not
a
part
of
his
regular
work
he
treats
the
priory
as
if
it
were
his
own
watches
it
guards
it
jealously
defends
it
he
drives
away
the
poor
the
vagrant
and
the
unfortunate
sniffing
and
threatening
like
a
he
is
a
type
of
the
servant
of
the
domestic
of
the
days
before
the
revolution
of
joseph
they
say
in
the
neighborhood
there
is
nobody
like
him
a
pearl
i
know
that
they
try
to
get
him
away
from
the
lanlaires
from
louviers
from
elbeuf
from
rouen
he
receives
the
most
flattering
offers
he
refuses
them
and
does
not
boast
of
having
refused
them
oh
no
indeed
he
has
been
here
for
fifteen
years
and
he
considers
this
house
as
his
own
as
long
as
they
want
him
he
will
stay
madame
suspicious
as
she
is
and
seeing
evil
everywhere
places
a
blind
confidence
in
him
she
who
believes
in
nobody
believes
in
joseph
in
joseph
honesty
in
joseph
devotion
a
pearl
he
would
throw
himself
into
the
fire
for
us
she
says
and
in
spite
of
her
avarice
she
overwhelms
him
with
petty
generosities
and
little
gifts
nevertheless
i
distrust
this
man
he
disturbs
me
and
at
the
same
time
he
interests
me
prodigiously
often
i
have
seen
frightful
things
passing
in
the
troubled
water
in
the
dead
water
of
his
eyes
since
i
have
been
observing
him
i
have
changed
the
opinion
that
i
formed
of
him
when
i
first
entered
this
house
the
opinion
that
he
is
a
gross
stupid
and
clumsy
peasant
i
ought
to
have
examined
him
more
attentively
now
i
think
him
singularly
shrewd
and
crafty
and
even
better
than
shrewd
worse
than
clever
i
know
not
how
to
express
myself
concerning
him
and
then
is
it
because
i
am
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
every
day
i
no
longer
find
him
so
ugly
or
so
old
habit
like
a
fog
tends
to
palliate
things
and
beings
little
by
little
it
obscures
the
features
of
a
face
and
rubs
down
deformities
if
you
live
with
a
humpback
day
in
and
day
out
after
a
time
he
loses
his
hump
but
there
is
something
else
i
am
discovering
something
new
and
profound
in
joseph
which
upsets
me
it
is
not
harmony
of
features
or
purity
of
lines
that
makes
a
man
beautiful
to
a
woman
it
is
something
less
apparent
less
defined
a
sort
of
affinity
and
if
i
dare
say
so
a
sort
of
sexual
atmosphere
pungent
terrible
or
intoxicating
to
the
haunting
influence
of
which
certain
women
are
susceptible
even
in
spite
of
themselves
well
such
an
atmosphere
emanates
from
joseph
the
other
day
i
admired
him
as
he
was
lifting
a
cask
of
wine
he
played
with
it
like
a
child
with
its
rubber
ball
his
exceptional
strength
his
supple
skill
the
terrible
leverage
of
his
loins
the
athletic
push
of
his
shoulders
all
combined
to
make
me
dreamy
the
strange
and
unhealthy
curiosity
prompted
by
fear
as
much
as
by
attraction
which
is
excited
in
me
by
the
riddle
of
these
suspicious
manners
of
this
closed
mouth
of
this
impressing
look
is
doubled
by
this
muscular
power
this
bull
back
without
being
able
to
explain
it
to
myself
further
i
feel
that
there
is
a
secret
correspondence
between
joseph
and
me
a
physical
and
moral
tie
that
is
becoming
a
little
more
binding
every
day
from
the
window
of
the
where
i
work
i
sometimes
follow
him
with
my
eyes
in
the
garden
there
he
is
bending
over
his
work
his
face
almost
touching
the
ground
or
else
kneeling
against
the
wall
where
the
espaliers
stand
in
line
and
suddenly
he
disappears
he
vanishes
lower
your
head
and
before
you
can
raise
it
again
he
is
gone
does
he
bury
himself
in
the
ground
does
he
pass
through
the
walls
from
time
to
time
i
have
occasion
to
go
to
the
garden
to
give
him
an
order
from
madame
i
do
not
see
him
anywhere
and
i
call
him
joseph
joseph
where
are
you
suddenly
without
a
sound
joseph
arises
before
me
from
behind
a
tree
from
behind
a
he
rises
before
me
in
the
sunlight
with
his
severe
and
impenetrable
mask
his
hair
glued
to
his
skull
and
his
open
shirt
revealing
his
hairy
chest
where
does
he
come
from
from
what
hole
does
he
spring
from
what
height
has
he
fallen
oh
joseph
how
you
frightened
me
and
over
joseph
lips
and
in
his
eyes
there
plays
a
terrifying
smile
which
really
has
the
swift
short
flashes
of
a
knife
i
believe
that
this
man
is
the
devil
the
murder
of
the
little
claire
continues
to
be
the
topic
and
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
town
they
fight
for
the
local
and
paris
newspapers
that
give
the
news
the
libre
parole
accuses
the
jews
squarely
and
by
wholesale
and
declares
that
it
was
a
ritual
murder
the
magistrates
have
visited
the
spot
made
inquiries
and
examinations
and
questioned
many
people
nobody
knows
a
thing
rose
charge
which
has
been
circulating
has
been
met
everywhere
with
an
incredulous
shrug
of
the
shoulders
yesterday
the
police
arrested
a
poor
peddler
who
had
no
trouble
in
proving
that
he
was
not
in
the
vicinity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
the
father
to
whom
public
rumor
pointed
has
been
exonerated
moreover
he
bears
an
excellent
reputation
so
nowhere
is
there
any
clue
to
put
justice
on
the
track
of
the
guilty
it
seems
that
this
crime
excites
the
admiration
of
the
magistrates
and
was
committed
with
a
surprising
skill
undoubtedly
by
professionals
by
parisians
it
seems
also
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
pushing
the
affair
in
a
very
tame
fashion
and
for
the
sake
of
form
the
murder
of
a
poor
little
girl
is
not
a
very
interesting
matter
so
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
no
clue
will
ever
be
found
and
that
the
case
will
soon
be
like
so
many
others
that
have
not
told
their
secret
i
should
not
wonder
if
madame
believed
her
husband
guilty
that
is
really
comical
and
she
ought
to
know
him
better
she
has
behaved
very
queerly
ever
since
the
news
she
has
ways
of
looking
at
monsieur
that
are
not
natural
i
have
noticed
that
during
meals
whenever
the
bell
rings
she
gives
a
little
start
after
breakfast
as
monsieur
manifested
an
intention
of
going
out
she
prevented
him
really
you
may
as
well
remain
here
why
do
you
need
to
be
always
going
out
she
even
walked
with
monsieur
for
a
full
hour
in
the
garden
naturally
monsieur
perceives
nothing
he
does
not
lose
a
mouthful
of
food
or
a
puff
of
what
a
stupid
blockhead
i
had
a
great
desire
to
know
what
they
could
be
saying
to
each
other
when
they
were
alone
the
two
of
them
last
night
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
i
listened
at
the
door
of
the
i
heard
monsieur
crumpling
a
newspaper
madame
seated
at
her
little
desk
was
casting
up
her
accounts
what
did
i
give
you
yesterday
madame
asked
two
francs
answered
monsieur
you
are
sure
why
yes
my
pet
well
i
am
short
sous
it
was
not
i
who
took
them
no
it
was
the
cat
of
the
other
matter
they
said
not
a
word
in
the
kitchen
joseph
does
not
like
to
have
us
talk
about
the
little
claire
when
marianne
or
i
broach
the
subject
he
immediately
changes
it
or
else
takes
no
part
in
the
conversation
it
annoys
him
i
do
not
know
why
but
the
idea
has
come
to
me
and
it
is
burying
itself
deeper
and
deeper
in
my
mind
that
it
was
joseph
who
did
it
i
have
no
proofs
no
clues
to
warrant
my
suspicion
no
other
clues
than
his
eyes
no
other
proofs
than
the
slight
movement
of
surprise
that
escaped
him
when
on
my
return
from
the
grocer
i
suddenly
in
the
threw
in
his
face
for
the
first
time
the
name
of
the
little
claire
murdered
and
outraged
and
yet
this
purely
intuitive
suspicion
has
grown
first
into
a
possibility
and
then
into
a
certainty
undoubtedly
i
am
mistaken
i
try
to
convince
myself
that
joseph
is
a
pearl
i
say
to
myself
over
and
over
again
that
my
imagination
takes
mad
flights
obedient
to
the
influence
of
the
romantic
perversity
that
is
in
me
but
all
in
vain
the
impression
remains
in
spite
of
myself
never
leaves
me
for
a
moment
and
is
assuming
the
tormenting
and
grimacing
form
of
a
fixed
idea
and
i
have
an
irresistible
desire
to
ask
joseph
say
joseph
was
it
you
who
outraged
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
was
it
you
old
pig
the
crime
was
committed
on
a
saturday
i
remember
that
joseph
at
about
that
date
went
to
the
forest
of
raillon
to
get
some
heath
mould
he
was
absent
all
day
and
did
not
return
to
the
priory
with
his
load
till
late
in
the
evening
of
that
i
am
sure
and
an
extraordinary
coincidence
i
remember
certain
restless
movements
certain
troubled
looks
that
he
had
that
evening
when
he
came
back
i
took
no
notice
of
them
then
why
should
i
have
done
so
but
these
facial
details
come
back
to
me
forcibly
but
was
it
on
the
saturday
of
the
crime
that
joseph
went
to
the
forest
of
raillon
i
seek
in
vain
to
fix
the
date
of
his
absence
and
then
had
he
really
the
restless
movements
the
accusing
looks
that
i
attribute
to
him
and
which
denounce
him
to
me
is
it
not
i
who
am
bent
upon
suggesting
to
myself
the
unusual
strangeness
of
those
movements
and
those
looks
am
i
not
determined
without
reason
and
against
all
probability
that
it
shall
be
joseph
a
pearl
who
did
it
it
irritates
me
and
at
the
same
time
confirms
me
in
my
apprehensions
that
i
can
not
reconstruct
before
my
eyes
the
tragedy
of
the
forest
if
only
the
judicial
examination
had
revealed
fresh
tracks
of
a
cart
on
the
dead
leaves
and
on
the
heather
in
the
neighborhood
but
no
the
examination
revealed
nothing
of
the
kind
it
revealed
the
outrage
and
murder
of
a
little
girl
and
that
is
all
well
it
is
precisely
that
which
so
excites
me
this
cleverness
of
the
assassin
in
leaving
not
the
slightest
trace
of
his
crime
behind
him
this
diabolical
invisibility
i
feel
in
it
and
see
in
it
the
presence
of
joseph
enervated
i
make
bold
suddenly
after
a
silence
to
ask
him
this
question
joseph
what
day
was
it
that
you
went
to
the
forest
of
raillon
to
get
heath
mould
do
you
remember
without
haste
without
a
start
joseph
puts
down
the
newspaper
that
he
was
reading
now
his
soul
is
steeled
against
surprises
why
do
you
ask
he
says
because
i
want
to
know
joseph
looks
at
me
with
his
heavy
searching
gaze
then
without
affectation
he
seems
to
be
ransacking
his
memory
in
search
of
recollections
that
are
already
old
and
he
answers
indeed
i
do
not
remember
exactly
i
think
though
that
it
was
on
a
saturday
the
saturday
when
the
body
of
the
little
claire
was
found
in
the
woods
i
go
on
giving
to
this
inquiry
too
quickly
uttered
an
aggressive
tone
joseph
does
not
take
his
eyes
from
mine
his
look
has
become
so
sharp
and
so
terrible
that
in
spite
of
my
customary
effrontery
i
am
obliged
to
turn
away
my
head
possibly
he
says
again
indeed
i
really
think
that
it
was
that
saturday
and
he
adds
oh
these
confounded
women
you
would
do
much
better
to
think
of
something
else
if
you
read
the
newspaper
you
would
see
that
they
have
been
killing
jews
again
in
algeria
that
at
least
is
something
worth
while
apart
from
his
look
he
is
calm
natural
almost
his
gestures
are
easy
his
voice
no
longer
trembles
i
become
silent
and
joseph
picking
up
the
newspaper
that
he
had
laid
on
the
table
begins
to
read
again
in
the
most
tranquil
fashion
in
the
world
for
my
part
i
have
begun
to
dream
again
now
that
i
am
about
it
i
should
like
to
find
in
joseph
life
some
act
of
real
ferocity
his
hatred
of
the
jews
his
continual
threats
to
torture
kill
and
burn
them
all
this
perhaps
is
nothing
but
swagger
and
political
swagger
at
that
i
am
looking
for
something
more
precise
and
formal
some
unmistakable
evidence
of
joseph
criminal
temperament
and
i
find
nothing
but
vague
and
moral
impressions
hypotheses
to
which
my
desire
or
my
fear
that
they
may
be
undeniable
realities
gives
an
importance
and
a
significance
which
undoubtedly
they
do
not
possess
my
desire
or
my
fear
i
do
not
know
which
of
these
two
sentiments
it
is
that
moves
me
but
yes
here
is
a
fact
a
real
fact
a
horrible
fact
a
revealing
fact
i
do
not
invent
it
i
do
not
exaggerate
it
i
did
not
dream
it
it
is
exactly
as
i
state
it
it
is
one
of
joseph
duties
to
kill
the
chickens
rabbits
and
ducks
he
kills
the
ducks
by
the
old
norman
method
of
burying
a
pin
in
their
head
he
could
kill
them
with
a
blow
without
giving
them
pain
but
he
loves
to
prolong
their
suffering
by
skilful
refinements
of
torture
he
loves
to
feel
their
flesh
quiver
and
their
heart
beat
in
his
hands
he
loves
to
follow
to
count
to
hold
in
his
hands
their
suffering
their
convulsions
their
death
once
i
saw
joseph
kill
a
duck
he
held
it
between
his
knees
with
one
hand
he
grasped
it
by
the
neck
with
the
other
he
buried
a
pin
in
its
head
and
then
he
turned
and
turned
the
pin
in
the
head
with
a
slow
and
regular
movement
one
would
have
thought
he
was
grinding
coffee
and
as
he
turned
the
pin
joseph
said
with
savage
joy
it
is
necessary
to
make
it
suffer
the
more
it
suffers
the
better
its
blood
will
taste
the
animal
had
freed
its
wings
from
joseph
knees
they
were
beating
beating
its
neck
in
spite
of
joseph
grasp
twisted
into
a
frightful
spiral
and
beneath
its
feathers
its
flesh
heaved
then
joseph
threw
the
animal
upon
the
stone
floor
of
the
kitchen
and
with
elbows
on
his
knees
and
chin
in
his
joined
palms
he
began
to
follow
with
a
look
of
hideous
satisfaction
its
bounds
its
convulsions
the
mad
scratching
of
its
yellow
claws
upon
the
floor
stop
then
joseph
i
cried
kill
it
at
once
it
is
horrible
to
make
animals
suffer
and
joseph
answered
that
amuses
me
i
like
to
see
that
i
recall
this
memory
i
evoke
all
its
sinister
details
i
hear
all
the
words
that
were
spoken
and
i
have
a
desire
a
still
more
violent
desire
to
cry
to
joseph
it
was
you
who
outraged
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
yes
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
now
it
was
you
you
you
old
pig
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
of
it
joseph
must
be
a
tremendous
scoundrel
and
this
opinion
that
i
have
of
his
moral
personality
instead
of
driving
me
from
him
far
from
placing
a
wall
of
horror
between
us
causes
me
not
to
love
him
perhaps
but
to
take
an
enormous
interest
in
him
it
is
queer
but
i
have
always
had
a
weakness
for
scoundrels
there
is
something
unexpected
about
them
that
lashes
the
blood
a
special
odor
that
intoxicates
you
something
strong
and
bitter
that
attracts
you
sexually
however
infamous
scoundrels
may
be
they
are
never
as
infamous
as
the
respectable
people
what
annoys
me
about
joseph
is
that
he
has
the
reputation
and
to
one
who
does
not
know
his
eyes
the
manners
of
an
honest
man
i
should
like
him
better
if
he
were
a
frank
and
impudent
scoundrel
it
is
true
that
he
would
lose
that
halo
of
mystery
that
prestige
of
the
unknown
which
moves
and
troubles
and
attracts
me
yes
really
attracts
me
toward
this
old
monster
now
i
am
calmer
because
i
am
certain
and
because
nothing
henceforth
can
remove
the
certainty
from
my
mind
that
it
was
he
who
outraged
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
for
some
time
i
have
noticed
that
i
have
made
a
considerable
impression
upon
joseph
heart
his
bad
reception
of
me
is
at
an
end
his
silence
toward
me
is
no
longer
hostile
or
contemptuous
and
there
is
something
approaching
tenderness
in
his
nudges
his
looks
have
no
more
hatred
in
them
did
they
ever
have
any
however
and
if
they
are
still
so
terrible
at
times
it
is
because
he
is
seeking
to
know
me
better
always
better
and
wishes
to
try
me
like
most
peasants
he
is
extremely
distrustful
and
avoids
trusting
himself
to
others
for
he
thinks
that
they
are
planning
to
take
him
in
he
must
be
in
possession
of
numerous
secrets
but
he
hides
them
jealously
under
a
severe
scowling
and
brutal
mask
as
one
locks
treasures
in
a
equipped
with
solid
bars
and
mysterious
bolts
however
his
distrust
of
me
is
lessening
he
is
charming
toward
me
in
his
way
he
does
all
that
he
can
to
show
his
friendship
for
me
and
to
please
me
he
relieves
me
of
my
most
painful
duties
takes
upon
himself
the
heavy
work
that
is
given
me
to
do
and
all
without
roguishness
without
any
underlying
gallantry
without
seeking
to
provoke
my
gratitude
without
trying
to
get
any
profit
from
it
whatsoever
on
my
side
i
keep
his
affairs
in
order
mend
his
stockings
and
his
pantaloons
patch
his
shirts
and
arrange
his
closet
with
much
more
care
and
coquetry
than
i
do
madame
and
he
says
to
me
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
that
is
very
well
célestine
you
are
a
good
woman
an
orderly
woman
order
you
see
means
fortune
and
when
one
is
pretty
besides
when
one
is
a
beautiful
woman
there
is
nothing
better
hitherto
we
have
talked
together
only
for
brief
moments
at
night
in
the
kitchen
with
marianne
the
conversation
has
to
be
general
no
intimacy
is
permissible
between
us
two
and
when
i
see
him
alone
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
make
him
talk
he
refuses
all
long
conversations
fearing
undoubtedly
to
compromise
himself
a
word
here
a
word
there
amiable
or
crusty
and
that
is
all
but
his
eyes
speak
though
his
lips
are
silent
and
they
prowl
around
me
and
they
envelop
me
and
they
descend
into
me
into
my
very
depths
in
order
to
turn
my
soul
inside
out
and
see
what
is
in
it
for
the
first
time
we
had
a
long
talk
yesterday
it
was
at
night
the
masters
had
gone
to
bed
marianne
had
gone
to
her
room
earlier
than
usual
not
feeling
disposed
to
read
or
write
it
was
tiresome
for
me
to
remain
alone
still
obsessed
by
the
image
of
the
little
claire
i
went
to
find
joseph
in
the
where
seated
at
a
little
table
he
was
sorting
seeds
by
the
light
of
a
dark
lantern
his
friend
the
sacristan
was
there
standing
near
him
holding
under
his
two
arms
packages
of
little
pamphlets
red
green
blue
tricolor
with
big
round
eyes
surpassing
the
arch
of
the
eyebrows
flattened
skull
and
wrinkled
yellow
and
skin
he
looked
like
a
toad
he
had
also
the
bounding
heaviness
of
a
toad
under
the
table
the
two
dogs
rolled
into
a
ball
were
sleeping
with
their
heads
buried
in
their
shaggy
skins
ah
it
is
you
célestine
exclaimed
joseph
the
sacristan
tried
to
hide
his
pamphlets
but
joseph
reassured
him
we
can
talk
before
mademoiselle
she
is
an
orderly
woman
and
he
gave
him
directions
so
old
man
it
is
understood
is
it
at
bazoches
at
courtain
at
and
let
them
be
distributed
in
the
and
try
to
get
subscriptions
and
let
me
tell
you
again
go
everywhere
into
all
the
houses
even
the
houses
of
republicans
perhaps
they
will
show
you
the
door
but
that
makes
no
difference
keep
right
on
if
you
win
one
of
these
dirty
pigs
it
is
always
so
much
gained
and
then
remember
that
you
get
five
francs
for
every
republican
the
sacristan
nodded
his
head
approvingly
having
tucked
the
pamphlets
under
his
arms
he
started
off
joseph
accompanying
him
as
far
as
the
iron
fence
when
the
latter
returned
he
noticed
my
curious
face
my
inquisitive
eyes
yes
he
said
carelessly
some
songs
and
some
pictures
and
some
pamphlets
against
the
jews
which
are
being
distributed
for
propagandism
i
have
made
an
arrangement
with
the
priests
i
work
for
them
it
is
in
the
line
of
my
own
ideas
surely
but
i
must
say
also
that
i
am
well
paid
he
sat
down
again
at
the
little
table
where
he
was
sorting
his
seeds
the
two
dogs
awakened
took
a
turn
about
the
room
and
went
to
lie
down
again
farther
off
yes
yes
he
repeated
i
get
good
pay
oh
the
priests
have
money
enough
and
as
if
fearing
that
he
had
said
too
much
he
added
i
tell
you
this
célestine
because
you
are
a
good
woman
and
an
orderly
woman
and
because
i
have
confidence
in
you
it
is
between
ourselves
you
know
after
a
silence
what
a
good
idea
it
was
of
yours
to
come
out
here
he
thanked
me
it
is
very
nice
of
you
it
flatters
me
never
had
i
seen
him
so
amiable
so
talkative
i
bent
over
the
little
table
very
near
him
and
stirring
the
sorted
seeds
in
the
plate
i
answered
coquettishly
it
is
true
too
you
went
away
directly
after
dinner
we
had
no
time
to
gossip
shall
i
help
you
sort
your
seeds
thank
you
célestine
i
have
finished
he
scratched
his
head
he
exclaimed
with
annoyance
i
ought
to
go
and
see
to
my
the
do
not
leave
me
a
salad
the
vermin
but
then
no
indeed
i
must
talk
with
you
célestine
joseph
rose
closed
the
door
which
had
been
left
half
open
and
led
me
to
the
back
of
the
for
a
minute
i
was
frightened
the
little
claire
whom
i
had
forgotten
appeared
before
my
eyes
on
the
forest
heath
frightfully
pale
and
bleeding
but
there
was
nothing
wicked
in
joseph
looks
they
were
timid
rather
we
could
scarcely
see
each
other
in
this
dark
room
lighted
by
the
dull
and
hazy
gleams
of
the
lantern
up
to
this
point
joseph
voice
had
trembled
now
it
suddenly
took
on
assurance
almost
gravity
for
some
days
i
have
been
wanting
to
confide
this
to
you
célestine
he
began
well
here
it
is
i
have
a
feeling
of
friendship
for
you
you
are
a
good
woman
an
orderly
woman
now
i
know
you
very
well
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
assume
an
archly
mischievous
smile
and
i
replied
you
must
admit
that
it
has
taken
you
some
time
and
why
were
you
so
disagreeable
with
me
you
never
spoke
to
me
you
were
always
rough
with
me
you
remember
the
scenes
that
you
made
me
when
i
went
through
the
paths
that
you
had
just
raked
oh
how
crusty
you
were
joseph
began
to
laugh
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
yes
why
you
know
one
can
not
get
acquainted
with
people
at
the
very
start
and
women
especially
it
takes
the
devil
to
know
them
and
you
came
from
paris
now
i
know
you
very
well
since
you
know
me
so
well
joseph
tell
me
then
what
i
am
with
set
lips
and
serious
eyes
he
said
what
you
are
célestine
you
are
like
me
i
am
like
you
i
oh
not
in
your
features
of
course
but
you
and
i
in
the
very
depths
of
the
soul
are
the
same
thing
yes
yes
i
know
what
i
say
again
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
he
resumed
in
a
voice
that
was
less
stern
i
have
a
feeling
of
friendship
for
you
célestine
and
then
and
then
i
have
some
money
too
a
little
money
ah
yes
a
little
money
why
one
does
not
serve
forty
years
in
good
houses
without
saving
something
is
it
not
so
surely
i
answered
more
and
more
astonished
by
joseph
words
and
manner
and
you
have
much
money
oh
only
a
little
how
much
let
me
see
joseph
gave
a
slight
chuckle
you
may
know
well
that
it
is
not
here
it
is
in
a
place
where
it
is
making
little
ones
yes
but
how
much
then
in
a
low
voice
almost
a
whisper
perhaps
fifteen
thousand
francs
perhaps
more
my
but
you
are
well
fixed
you
are
oh
perhaps
less
too
one
can
not
tell
suddenly
the
two
dogs
lifted
their
heads
simultaneously
bounded
to
the
door
and
began
to
bark
i
made
a
movement
of
fright
that
nothing
said
joseph
reassuringly
giving
each
of
them
a
kick
in
the
side
simply
people
passing
in
the
road
why
it
is
rose
going
home
i
know
her
step
and
in
fact
a
few
seconds
later
i
heard
a
sound
of
dragging
steps
in
the
road
and
then
a
more
distant
sound
of
a
closing
gate
the
dogs
became
silent
again
i
had
sat
down
on
a
stool
in
a
corner
of
the
joseph
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
walked
back
and
forth
in
the
narrow
room
his
elbows
hitting
against
the
pine
wainscoting
from
which
leather
straps
were
hanging
we
did
not
speak
i
being
horribly
embarrassed
and
regretting
that
i
had
come
and
joseph
being
plainly
tormented
by
what
he
had
still
to
say
to
me
after
some
minutes
he
made
up
his
mind
there
is
another
thing
that
i
must
confide
to
you
célestine
i
am
from
cherbourg
and
cherbourg
is
a
tough
town
full
of
sailors
and
soldiers
of
jolly
lascars
who
do
not
deny
themselves
pleasure
business
is
good
there
well
i
know
a
fine
opportunity
just
now
at
cherbourg
it
is
a
matter
of
a
little
café
near
the
water
a
little
café
in
a
location
the
army
is
drinking
a
great
deal
these
days
all
the
patriots
are
in
the
street
they
shout
and
bawl
and
get
thirsty
now
is
the
time
to
get
it
one
could
make
hundreds
and
thousands
i
promise
you
only
you
see
there
must
be
a
woman
there
an
orderly
woman
a
pretty
woman
well
equipped
and
not
afraid
of
slang
and
smut
the
sailors
and
soldiers
are
and
gay
and
full
of
fun
they
get
drunk
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
they
are
fond
of
women
and
spend
much
for
them
what
do
you
think
about
it
célestine
i
i
exclaimed
stupefied
yes
just
suppose
the
case
would
you
like
it
i
i
did
not
know
what
he
was
coming
at
i
trembled
from
surprise
to
surprise
utterly
upset
i
could
think
of
no
answer
to
make
he
insisted
you
of
course
and
who
then
do
you
expect
to
come
to
the
little
café
you
are
a
good
woman
you
are
orderly
you
are
not
one
of
those
affected
creatures
who
do
not
know
even
how
to
take
a
joke
and
you
are
patriotic
and
then
you
are
pretty
very
nice
to
look
at
you
have
eyes
to
drive
the
whole
cherbourg
garrison
crazy
just
the
cheese
now
that
i
know
you
well
now
that
i
know
all
that
you
can
do
this
idea
keeps
continually
running
through
my
head
well
and
you
i
too
of
course
we
would
marry
like
good
friends
then
cried
i
with
sudden
indignation
you
want
me
to
prostitute
myself
to
make
money
for
you
joseph
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
tranquilly
all
depends
on
the
intention
célestine
that
is
understood
is
it
not
then
he
came
to
me
took
my
hands
pressed
them
so
tightly
that
i
screamed
with
pain
and
stammered
i
dream
of
you
célestine
i
dream
of
you
in
the
little
café
i
am
crazy
over
you
and
as
i
stood
in
amazement
a
little
frightened
by
this
confession
and
without
a
gesture
or
a
word
he
continued
and
then
perhaps
there
are
more
than
fifteen
thousand
francs
perhaps
more
than
eighteen
thousand
francs
one
never
knows
how
many
little
ones
this
money
makes
and
then
things
things
jewels
you
would
be
tremendously
happy
in
the
little
café
he
held
my
waist
clasped
in
the
powerful
vise
of
his
arms
and
i
felt
his
whole
body
against
me
trembling
with
desire
if
he
had
wished
he
could
have
taken
me
and
stifled
me
without
the
slightest
resistance
on
my
part
and
he
continued
to
unfold
his
dream
a
little
café
very
pretty
very
clean
very
shining
and
then
at
the
bar
before
a
large
mirror
a
beautiful
woman
dressed
in
the
costume
of
with
a
beautiful
silk
waist
and
broad
velvet
ribbons
hey
célestine
think
of
that
i
will
talk
with
you
about
it
again
one
of
these
days
i
will
talk
with
you
about
it
again
i
found
nothing
to
say
nothing
nothing
nothing
i
was
stupefied
by
this
thing
of
which
i
had
never
dreamed
but
i
was
also
without
hatred
without
horror
of
this
man
cynicism
clasping
me
with
the
same
hands
that
had
clasped
stifled
strangled
murdered
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
joseph
repeated
i
will
talk
with
you
about
it
again
i
am
old
i
am
ugly
possibly
but
to
fix
a
woman
célestine
mark
this
well
there
is
nobody
like
me
i
will
talk
with
you
about
it
again
to
fix
a
woman
how
he
fills
one
with
forebodings
is
it
a
threat
is
it
a
promise
joseph
has
resumed
his
customary
silence
one
would
think
nothing
had
happened
last
night
between
us
he
goes
he
comes
he
works
he
eats
he
reads
his
paper
just
as
usual
i
look
at
him
and
i
should
like
to
detest
him
i
wish
that
his
ugliness
would
fill
me
with
such
immense
disgust
as
to
separate
me
from
him
forever
well
no
ah
how
queer
it
is
this
man
sends
shivers
through
me
and
i
feel
no
disgust
and
it
is
a
frightful
thing
that
i
feel
no
disgust
since
it
was
he
who
killed
and
outraged
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
x
nothing
gives
me
so
much
pleasure
as
to
find
in
the
newspapers
the
name
of
a
person
in
whose
house
i
have
served
this
pleasure
i
felt
this
morning
more
keenly
than
ever
before
in
learning
from
the
petit
journal
that
victor
charrigaud
has
just
published
a
new
book
which
has
met
with
much
approval
and
of
which
everybody
speaks
in
admiration
this
book
is
entitled
from
five
to
seven
and
is
a
howling
success
it
is
says
the
article
a
series
of
brilliant
and
cutting
society
studies
which
beneath
their
light
exterior
hide
a
profound
philosophy
yes
rely
upon
it
at
the
same
time
that
they
praise
victor
charrigaud
for
his
talent
they
also
compliment
him
highly
on
his
elegance
on
his
distinguished
social
position
on
his
ah
let
us
say
a
word
of
his
for
eight
months
i
was
the
chambermaid
and
i
really
believe
that
i
have
never
met
such
boors
god
knows
however
everybody
is
familiar
with
the
name
victor
charrigaud
he
has
already
published
a
series
of
books
that
have
made
a
sensation
their
little
garters
how
they
sleep
the
sentimental
bigoudis
and
parrots
are
among
the
most
celebrated
he
is
a
man
of
infinite
wit
a
writer
of
infinite
talent
unhappily
success
and
wealth
have
come
to
him
too
quickly
his
beginnings
aroused
the
greatest
hopes
everybody
was
struck
with
his
great
faculty
of
observation
with
his
powerful
gift
of
satire
with
his
implacable
and
just
irony
that
penetrated
so
deeply
humanity
ridiculous
side
a
and
free
mind
to
which
social
conventions
were
nothing
but
falsehood
and
servility
a
generous
and
soul
which
instead
of
bending
under
the
humiliating
level
of
prejudice
bravely
directed
its
impulses
toward
a
pure
and
elevated
social
ideal
at
least
so
victor
charrigaud
was
described
to
me
by
one
of
his
friends
a
painter
who
was
stuck
on
me
and
whom
i
used
sometimes
to
go
to
see
and
from
whom
i
got
the
opinions
just
expressed
and
the
details
that
are
to
follow
regarding
the
literature
and
the
life
of
this
illustrious
man
among
the
ridiculous
things
that
charrigaud
had
lashed
so
severely
there
was
none
that
he
had
treated
so
harshly
as
snobbishness
in
his
lively
conversation
well
supported
by
facts
even
more
than
in
his
books
he
branded
its
moral
cowardice
and
its
intellectual
barrenness
with
a
bitter
precision
in
the
picturesque
a
comprehensive
and
merciless
philosophy
and
sharp
profound
terrible
words
which
taken
up
by
some
and
passed
on
by
others
were
repeated
at
the
four
corners
of
paris
and
at
once
became
classics
in
a
way
a
complete
and
astonishing
psychology
of
snobbishness
is
contained
in
the
impressions
the
traits
the
concise
profiles
the
and
silhouettes
of
which
this
prodigal
and
originality
was
an
source
it
seems
then
that
if
any
one
should
have
escaped
that
sort
of
moral
influenza
which
rages
so
violently
in
the
it
was
victor
charrigaud
better
protected
than
anybody
else
against
contagion
by
that
admirable
antiseptic
irony
but
man
is
nothing
but
surprise
contradiction
incoherence
and
folly
scarcely
had
he
felt
the
first
caresses
of
success
when
the
snob
that
was
in
him
and
that
was
the
reason
why
he
was
able
to
paint
the
snob
with
such
force
of
expression
revealed
itself
exploded
one
might
say
like
an
engine
that
has
just
received
an
electric
shock
he
began
by
dropping
those
friends
that
had
become
embarrassing
or
compromising
keeping
only
those
who
some
by
their
recognized
talent
others
by
their
position
in
the
press
could
be
useful
to
him
and
bolster
his
young
fame
by
their
persistent
puffery
at
the
same
time
he
made
dress
and
fashion
a
subject
of
most
careful
consideration
he
was
seen
in
frock
coats
of
an
audacious
philippism
wearing
collars
and
cravats
of
the
style
of
much
exaggerated
velvet
waistcoats
of
irresistible
cut
and
showy
jewels
and
he
took
from
metal
cases
inlaid
with
too
precious
stones
cigarettes
sumptuously
rolled
in
gilt
paper
but
heavy
of
limb
and
awkward
of
movement
he
retained
in
spite
of
everything
the
unwieldy
gait
of
the
auvergne
peasants
his
compatriots
too
new
in
a
too
sudden
elegance
in
which
he
did
not
feel
at
home
in
vain
did
he
study
himself
and
the
most
perfect
models
of
parisian
style
he
could
not
acquire
that
ease
that
supple
delicate
and
upright
line
which
he
saw
in
the
young
swells
at
the
clubs
at
the
at
the
theatres
and
at
the
restaurants
and
which
he
envied
them
with
a
most
violent
hatred
it
astonished
him
for
after
all
he
patronized
only
the
most
select
furnishing
houses
the
most
famous
tailors
memorable
and
what
shoemakers
what
shoemakers
examining
himself
in
the
glass
he
threw
insults
at
himself
in
his
despair
in
vain
do
i
cover
myself
with
velvets
silks
and
satin
i
always
look
like
a
boor
there
is
always
something
that
is
not
natural
as
for
madame
charrigaud
who
previously
had
dressed
very
simply
and
with
discreet
taste
she
too
sported
showy
and
stunning
costumes
with
hair
too
red
jewels
too
big
silks
too
rich
giving
her
the
air
of
a
laundry
queen
the
majesty
of
a
empress
they
made
a
great
deal
of
sport
of
her
sometimes
cruelly
old
comrades
at
once
humiliated
and
delighted
by
so
much
luxury
and
so
much
bad
taste
avenged
themselves
by
saying
jestingly
of
this
poor
victor
charrigaud
really
for
an
ironist
he
has
no
luck
thanks
to
fortunate
manoeuvres
incessant
diplomacy
and
more
incessant
platitudes
they
were
received
into
what
they
called
they
too
real
society
in
the
houses
of
jewish
bankers
venezuelan
dukes
and
vagrant
and
in
the
houses
of
very
old
ladies
crazed
over
literature
panderism
and
the
academy
they
thought
of
nothing
but
cultivating
and
developing
these
new
relations
and
of
acquiring
others
more
desirable
and
more
difficult
of
attainment
others
others
and
always
others
one
day
to
free
himself
from
an
obligation
which
he
had
stupidly
assumed
by
accepting
an
invitation
to
the
house
of
a
friend
who
was
not
a
conspicuous
personage
but
whom
he
was
not
yet
ready
to
drop
charrigaud
wrote
him
the
following
letter
dear
old
friend
we
are
disconsolate
excuse
us
for
not
keeping
our
promise
for
monday
but
we
have
just
received
for
that
very
day
an
invitation
to
dine
at
the
rothschilds
it
is
the
first
you
understand
that
we
can
not
refuse
it
would
be
disastrous
fortunately
i
know
your
heart
far
from
being
angry
with
us
i
am
sure
that
you
will
share
our
joy
and
our
pride
another
day
he
was
telling
of
the
purchase
that
he
had
just
made
of
a
villa
at
deauville
i
really
do
know
for
whom
these
people
took
us
they
undoubtedly
took
us
for
journalists
for
bohemians
but
i
quickly
let
them
see
that
i
had
a
notary
gradually
he
eliminated
all
that
remained
of
the
friends
of
his
youth
those
friends
whose
simple
presence
in
his
house
was
a
constant
and
disagreeable
reminder
of
the
past
and
a
confession
of
that
stain
of
that
social
inferiority
literature
and
labor
and
he
contrived
also
to
extinguish
the
flames
that
sometimes
kindled
in
his
brain
and
to
finally
stifle
that
cursed
wit
whose
sudden
revival
on
certain
occasions
it
frightened
him
to
feel
supposing
it
to
be
dead
forever
then
it
was
no
longer
enough
for
him
to
be
received
in
the
houses
of
others
he
desired
in
turn
to
receive
others
in
his
own
house
his
occupancy
of
a
residence
of
some
pretension
which
he
had
just
bought
in
auteuil
was
made
the
pretext
for
a
dinner
i
entered
their
service
at
the
time
when
the
charrigauds
had
at
last
resolved
to
give
this
dinner
not
one
of
those
private
dinners
gay
and
without
pose
such
as
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
giving
and
which
for
some
years
had
made
their
house
so
charming
but
a
really
elegant
really
solemn
dinner
a
stiff
and
chilly
dinner
a
select
dinner
to
which
should
be
ceremoniously
invited
together
with
some
correct
celebrities
of
literature
and
art
some
society
personalities
not
too
difficult
to
reach
not
too
regularly
established
but
sufficiently
decorative
to
shed
a
little
of
their
brilliancy
upon
their
hosts
for
the
difficult
thing
said
victor
charrigaud
is
not
to
dine
in
the
city
but
to
give
a
dinner
at
home
after
thinking
over
the
plan
for
a
long
time
victor
charrigaud
made
this
proposition
well
i
have
it
i
think
that
at
first
we
can
have
only
divorced
women
with
their
lovers
we
must
begin
somewhere
there
are
some
who
are
very
suitable
and
whom
the
most
catholic
newspapers
speak
of
with
admiration
later
when
our
connections
shall
have
become
more
extensive
and
at
the
same
time
more
select
why
we
can
let
the
divorced
people
slide
you
are
right
approved
mme
charrigaud
for
the
moment
the
important
thing
is
to
get
the
best
people
among
those
who
are
divorced
say
what
you
will
the
time
has
come
when
a
divorce
gives
a
person
a
certain
position
it
has
at
least
the
merit
of
abolishing
adultery
chuckled
charrigaud
adultery
is
now
very
nobody
but
friend
bourget
now
believes
in
adultery
christian
adultery
and
in
english
furniture
to
which
mme
charrigaud
replied
in
a
tone
of
nervous
vexation
how
you
tire
me
with
your
maliciously
wicked
remarks
you
will
see
you
will
see
that
because
of
them
we
shall
never
be
able
to
establish
a
desirable
and
she
added
if
you
really
wish
to
become
a
man
of
society
you
must
learn
first
either
to
be
an
imbecile
or
to
hold
your
tongue
they
made
unmade
and
remade
a
list
of
guests
which
after
laborious
combinations
was
finally
settled
upon
as
follows
the
countess
fergus
divorced
and
her
friend
the
economist
and
deputy
joseph
brigard
the
baroness
henri
gogsthein
divorced

her
friend
mme
tiercelet
suing
for

sir
harry
kimberly
symbolist
musician
and
his
young
friend
lucien
sartorys
as
beautiful
as
a
woman
as
supple
as
a
de
glove
as
slender
and
blonde
as
a
cigar
the
two
academicians
joseph
dupont
de

collector
of

coins
and
isidore

de

author
of

the
jacques

the

maurice
fernancourt
the
society
reporter
poult
the
invitations
were
sent
out
and
thanks
to
the
mediation
of
influential
persons
all
were
accepted
the
countess
fergus
alone
hesitated
the
charrigauds
said
she
is
theirs
really
a
proper
house
has
he
not
been
engaged
in
all
sorts
of
pursuits
on
montmartre
in
the
past
do
they
not
say
that
he
sold
obscene
photographs
for
which
he
had
posed
with
an
artificial
bust
and
are
there
not
some
disagreeable
stories
afloat
regarding
her
did
she
not
have
some
rather
vulgar
experiences
before
her
marriage
is
it
not
said
that
she
has
been
a
model
that
she
has
posed
for
the
altogether
what
a
horror
a
woman
who
stripped
before
men
who
are
not
even
her
lovers
finally
she
accepted
the
invitation
on
being
assured
that
mme
charrigaud
had
posed
only
for
the
head
that
charrigaud
who
was
very
vindictive
would
be
quite
capable
of
disgracing
her
in
one
of
his
books
and
that
kimberly
would
come
to
this
dinner
oh
if
kimberly
had
promised
to
come
kimberly
such
a
perfect
gentleman
and
so
delicate
and
so
charming
really
charming
the
charrigauds
were
informed
of
these
negotiations
and
these
scruples
far
from
taking
offence
they
congratulated
themselves
that
they
had
successfully
conducted
the
former
and
overcome
the
latter
it
was
now
a
matter
only
of
watching
themselves
and
as
mme
charrigaud
said
of
behaving
themselves
like
real
society
people
this
dinner
so
marvelously
prepared
and
planned
so
skilfully
negotiated
was
really
their
first
manifestation
in
the
new
avatar
of
their
elegant
destiny
of
their
social
ambitions
it
must
then
be
an
astonishing
affair
for
a
week
beforehand
everything
was
in
the
house
it
was
necessary
that
the
apartments
should
be
made
to
look
like
new
and
that
there
should
be
no
hitch
they
tried
various
lighting
arrangements
and
table
decorations
that
they
might
not
be
embarrassed
at
the
last
moment
over
these
matters
and
mme
charrigaud
quarreled
like
porters
for
they
had
not
the
same
ideas
and
their
æsthetic
views
differed
on
all
points
she
inclining
to
sentimental
arrangements
he
preferring
the
severe
and
artistic
it
is
idiotic
cried
charrigaud
they
will
think
that
they
are
in
a
grisette
apartments
ah
what
a
we
shall
be
you
had
better
not
talk
replied
mme
charrigaud
her
nervousness
reaching
the
point
of
paroxysm
you
are
still
what
you
used
to
be
a
dirty
tavern
bum
and
besides
i
have
enough
of
it
my
back
is
broken
with
it
well
that
it
let
us
have
a
divorce
my
little
wolf
let
us
have
a
divorce
by
that
means
we
at
least
shall
complete
the
series
and
cast
no
reflection
on
our
guests
they
perceived
also
that
there
would
not
be
enough
silverware
glassware
and
plates
they
must
rent
some
and
also
rent
some
chairs
for
they
had
only
fifteen
and
even
these
were
not
perfect
finally
the
menu
was
ordered
of
one
of
the
grand
caterers
of
the
boulevard
let
everything
be
ordered
mme
charrigaud
and
let
no
one
be
able
to
recognize
the
dishes
that
are
served
shrimp
hash
cutlets
game
that
looks
like
ham
ham
that
looks
like
cake
truffles
in
whipped
cream
and
mashed
potatoes
in
branches
cherries
in
squares
and
peaches
twisted
into
spirals
in
short
have
everything
as
stylish
as
possible
rest
easy
declared
the
caterer
i
know
so
well
how
to
disguise
things
that
i
defy
anybody
to
know
what
he
is
eating
it
is
a
specialty
of
the
house
at
last
the
great
day
arrived
monsieur
rose
early
anxious
nervous
agitated
madame
who
had
been
unable
to
sleep
all
night
and
weary
from
the
errands
of
the
day
before
and
the
preparations
of
all
sorts
could
not
keep
still
five
or
six
times
with
wrinkled
brow
out
of
breath
trembling
and
so
weary
that
as
she
said
she
felt
her
belly
in
her
heels
she
made
a
final
examination
of
the
house
upset
and
rearranged
and
furniture
without
reason
and
went
from
one
room
to
another
without
knowing
why
and
as
if
she
were
mad
she
trembled
lest
the
cooks
might
not
come
lest
the
florist
might
fail
them
and
lest
the
guests
might
not
be
placed
at
table
in
accordance
with
strict
etiquette
monsieur
followed
her
everywhere
clad
only
in
pink
silk
drawers
approving
here
criticising
there
now
that
i
think
about
it
again
said
he
what
a
queer
idea
that
was
of
yours
to
order
centauries
for
the
table
decoration
i
assure
you
that
blue
becomes
black
in
the
light
and
then
after
all
centauries
are
nothing
but
simple
it
will
look
as
if
we
had
been
to
the
fields
to
gather
oh
how
provoking
you
are
yes
indeed
and
the
as
kimberly
said
very
truly
the
other
evening
at
the
rothschilds
is
not
a
society
flower
why
not
also
corn
poppies
let
me
alone
answered
madame
you
drive
me
crazy
with
all
your
stupid
observations
a
nice
time
to
offer
them
indeed
but
monsieur
was
obstinate
all
right
all
right
you
will
see
you
will
see
provided
my
god
that
everything
goes
off
tolerably
well
without
too
many
accidents
without
too
many
delays
i
did
not
know
that
to
be
society
people
was
so
difficult
so
fatiguing
and
so
complicated
a
matter
perhaps
we
ought
to
have
remained
simple
boors
and
madame
growled
oh
for
that
matter
i
see
clearly
that
nothing
will
change
you
you
scarcely
do
honor
to
a
woman
as
they
thought
me
pretty
and
very
elegant
to
look
at
my
masters
had
allotted
to
me
also
an
important
in
this
comedy
first
i
was
to
preside
over
the
and
then
to
aid
or
rather
superintend
the
four
butlers
four
tall
lascars
with
immense
selected
from
several
to
serve
this
extraordinary
dinner
at
first
all
went
well
nevertheless
there
was
a
moment
of
alarm
at
quarter
before
nine
the
countess
fergus
had
not
yet
arrived
suppose
she
had
changed
her
mind
and
resolved
at
the
last
moment
not
to
come
what
a
humiliation
what
a
disaster
the
charrigauds
were
in
a
state
of
consternation
joseph
brigard
reassured
them
it
was
the
day
when
the
countess
had
to
preside
over
her
admirable
society
for
the
collection
of
for
the
army
and
navy
the
sessions
sometimes
did
not
end
till
very
late
what
a
charming
woman
said
mme
charrigaud
ecstatically
as
if
this
eulogy
had
the
magic
power
to
hasten
the
coming
of
this
dirty
countess
whom
at
the
bottom
of
her
soul
she
cursed
and
what
a
brain
said
charrigaud
going
her
one
better
though
really
entertaining
the
same
feeling
the
other
day
at
the
rothschilds
i
felt
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
last
century
to
find
such
perfect
grace
and
such
superiority
and
even
then
said
joseph
brigard
capping
the
climax
you
see
my
dear
monsieur
charrigaud
in
democratic
societies
based
upon
equality
he
was
about
to
deliver
one
of
those
discourses
which
he
was
fond
of
retailing
in
the
when
the
countess
fergus
entered
imposing
and
majestic
in
a
black
gown
embroidered
with
jet
and
steel
that
showed
off
the
fat
whiteness
and
soft
beauty
of
her
shoulders
and
it
was
amid
murmurs
and
whispers
of
admiration
that
they
made
their
way
ceremoniously
to
the
the
beginning
of
the
dinner
was
rather
cold
in
spite
of
her
success
perhaps
even
because
of
her
success
the
countess
fergus
was
a
little
haughty
or
at
least
too
reserved
she
seemed
to
wear
an
air
of
condescension
at
having
honored
with
her
presence
the
humble
house
of
these
little
people
charrigaud
thought
he
noticed
that
she
examined
with
a
discreetly
but
visibly
contemptuous
pout
the
rented
silverware
the
table
decoration
mme
charrigaud
green
costume
and
the
four
butlers
whose
too
long
dipped
into
the
dishes
he
was
filled
with
vague
terrors
and
agonizing
doubts
as
to
the
proper
appearance
of
his
table
and
his
wife
it
was
a
horrible
minute
after
some
commonplace
and
laborious
replies
exchanged
apropos
of
trivial
topics
then
current
the
conversation
gradually
became
general
and
finally
settled
down
upon
the
subject
of
correctness
in
society
life
all
these
poor
devils
all
these
poor
wretches
male
and
female
forgetting
their
own
social
irregularities
showed
a
strangely
implacable
severity
toward
persons
whom
it
was
allowable
to
suspect
not
even
of
stains
or
blemishes
but
simply
of
some
formal
lack
of
respect
for
society
laws
the
only
ones
that
ought
to
be
obeyed
living
in
a
certain
sense
outside
of
their
social
ideal
thrown
back
so
to
speak
to
the
margin
of
that
existence
whose
disgraced
correctness
and
regularity
they
honored
as
a
religion
they
undoubtedly
hoped
to
get
into
it
again
by
driving
out
others
the
comicality
of
this
was
really
intense
and
savory
they
divided
the
universe
into
two
great
parts
on
the
one
side
that
which
is
regular
on
the
other
that
which
is
not
here
the
people
that
one
may
receive
there
the
people
that
one
may
not
receive
and
these
two
great
parts
soon
became
pieces
and
the
pieces
became
thin
slices
the
subdivision
going
on
there
were
those
in
whose
houses
one
may
dine
and
also
those
to
whose
houses
one
may
go
only
for
the
evening
those
in
whose
houses
one
may
not
dine
but
to
which
one
may
go
for
the
evening
those
whom
one
may
receive
at
his
table
and
those
to
whom
one
may
accord
only
admission
to
his
and
even
then
only
under
certain
circumstances
clearly
defined
there
were
also
those
in
whose
houses
one
may
not
dine
and
whom
one
should
not
receive
at
one
house
and
those
whom
one
may
receive
at
one
house
and
in
whose
houses
one
may
not
dine
those
whom
one
may
receive
at
breakfast
and
never
at
dinner
and
those
in
whose
country
houses
one
may
dine
but
never
in
their
paris
residences
etc
the
whole
being
supported
with
demonstrative
and
peremptory
examples
names
being
cited
by
way
of
illustration
shades
said
the
viscount
lahyrais
sportsman
clubman
gambler
and
trickster
the
whole
thing
lies
there
it
is
by
the
strict
observance
of
shades
that
a
man
is
really
in
society
or
is
not
i
believe
that
i
never
heard
such
dreary
things
as
i
listened
to
them
i
really
felt
a
pity
for
these
unfortunates
charrigaud
neither
ate
or
drank
and
said
nothing
although
he
was
scarcely
in
the
conversation
he
nevertheless
felt
its
enormous
and
forbidding
stupidity
like
a
weight
upon
his
skull
impatient
feverish
very
pale
he
watched
the
service
tried
to
catch
favorable
or
ironical
impressions
of
the
faces
of
his
guests
and
mechanically
with
movements
more
and
more
accelerated
and
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
his
wife
rolled
big
pellets
of
between
his
fingers
when
a
question
was
put
to
him
he
answered
in
a
bewildered
distracted
voice
certainly
certainly
certainly
opposite
him
very
stiff
in
her
green
gown
upon
which
spangles
of
green
steel
glittered
with
a
phosphorescent
brilliancy
and
wearing
an
aigrette
of
red
feathers
in
her
hair
mme
charrigaud
bent
to
right
and
to
left
and
smiled
without
ever
a
word
a
smile
so
eternally
motionless
that
it
seemed
painted
on
her
lips
what
a
goose
said
charrigaud
to
himself
what
a
stupid
and
ridiculous
woman
and
what
a
carnival
costume
because
of
her
we
shall
be
the
of
parisian
society
and
on
her
side
mme
charrigaud
beneath
the
fixity
of
her
smile
was
thinking
what
an
idiot
this
victor
is
and
what
a
bad
appearance
he
makes
we
shall
catch
it
on
account
of
his
pellets
the
topic
of
correctness
in
society
being
exhausted
there
followed
an
embarrassing
lull
in
the
conversation
which
kimberly
broke
by
telling
of
his
last
trip
to
london
yes
said
he
i
spent
in
london
an
intoxicating
week
and
ladies
i
witnessed
a
unique
thing
i
attended
a
ritual
dinner
which
the
great
poet
farfadetti
gave
to
some
friends
to
celebrate
his
betrothal
to
the
wife
of
his
dear
pinggleton
how
exquisite
that
must
have
been
minced
the
countess
fergus
you
can
not
imagine
answered
kimberly
whose
look
and
gestures
and
even
the
orchid
that
adorned
the
of
his
coat
expressed
the
most
ardent
ecstasy
and
he
continued
fancy
my
dear
friends
in
a
large
hall
whose
blue
walls
though
scarcely
blue
are
decorated
with
white
peacocks
and
gold
peacocks
fancy
a
table
of
jade
inconceivably
and
delightfully
oval
on
the
table
some
cups
in
which
mauve
and
yellow
bonbons
harmonized
and
in
the
centre
a
basin
of
pink
crystal
filled
with
kanaka
preserves
and
nothing
more
draped
in
long
white
robes
we
slowly
passed
in
turn
before
the
table
and
we
took
upon
the
points
of
our
golden
knives
a
little
of
these
mysterious
preserves
which
then
we
carried
to
our
lips
and
nothing
more
oh
i
find
that
moving
sighed
the
countess
so
moving
you
can
not
imagine
but
the
most
moving
thing
a
thing
that
really
transformed
this
emotion
into
a
painful
laceration
of
our
souls
was
when
pinggleton
sang
the
poem
of
the
betrothal
of
his
wife
and
his
friend
i
know
nothing
more
tragically
more
superhumanly
beautiful
oh
i
beg
of
you
implored
the
countess
fergus
repeat
this
prodigious
poem
for
our
benefit
kimberly
the
poem
alas
i
can
not
i
can
give
you
only
its
essence
that
it
that
it
the
essence
in
spite
of
his
morals
in
which
they
cut
no
figure
kimberly
filled
women
with
mad
enthusiasm
for
his
specialty
was
subtle
stories
of
transgression
and
of
extraordinary
sensations
suddenly
a
thrill
ran
round
the
table
and
the
flowers
themselves
and
the
jewels
on
their
beds
of
flesh
and
the
glasses
on
the
took
attitudes
in
harmony
with
the
state
of
souls
charrigaud
felt
his
reason
departing
he
thought
that
he
had
suddenly
fallen
into
a
yet
by
force
of
will
he
was
still
able
to
smile
and
say
why
certainly
certainly
the
butlers
finished
passing
something
that
resembled
a
ham
from
which
in
a
flood
of
yellow
cream
cherries
poured
like
red
larvæ
as
for
the
countess
fergus
half
swooning
she
had
already
started
for
regions
kimberly
began
pinggleton
and
his
friend
farfadetti
were
finishing
their
daily
tasks
in
the
studio
which
they
occupied
in
common
one
was
the
great
painter
the
other
the
great
poet
the
former
short
and
stout
the
latter
tall
and
thin
both
alike
clad
in
drugget
robes
their
heads
alike
adorned
with
florentine
bonnets
both
alike
neurasthenics
for
they
had
in
different
bodies
like
souls
and
spirits
farfadetti
sang
in
his
verses
the
marvelous
symbols
that
his
friend
pinggleton
painted
on
his
canvases
so
that
the
glory
of
the
poet
was
inseparable
from
that
of
the
painter
and
that
their
works
and
their
immortal
geniuses
had
come
to
be
confounded
in
one
and
the
same
adoration
kimberly
stopped
for
a
moment
the
silence
was
religious
something
sacred
hovered
over
the
table
he
continued
the
day
was
nearing
its
end
a
very
soft
twilight
was
enveloping
the
studio
in
a
pallor
of
fluid
and
lunar
shade
scarcely
could
one
still
distinguish
on
the
mauve
walls
the
long
supple
waving
golden
algæ
that
seemed
to
move
in
obedience
to
the
vibration
of
some
deep
and
magic
water
farfadetti
closed
the
sort
of
antiphonary
on
the
vellum
of
which
with
a
persian
reed
he
wrote
or
rather
engraved
his
eternal
poems
pinggleton
turned
his
easel
against
a
piece
of
drapery
placed
his
palette
upon
a
fragile
piece
of
furniture
and
the
two
facing
one
another
stretched
themselves
with
august
poses
of
fatigue
upon
a
triple
row
of
cushions
of
the
color
of
hum
said
mme
tiercelet
with
a
slightly
warning
cough
no
not
at
all
said
kimberly
reassuringly
it
is
not
what
you
think
and
he
continued
in
the
centre
of
the
studio
from
a
marble
basin
in
which
the
petals
of
roses
were
bathing
a
violent
perfume
was
rising
and
on
a
little
table
narcissuses
were
dying
like
souls
in
a
narrow
vase
whose
neck
opened
into
the
calyx
of
a
lily
strangely
green
and
distorted
impossible
to
forget
said
the
countess
in
a
quivering
voice
so
low
that
it
could
scarcely
be
heard
and
kimberly
without
stopping
went
on
with
his
narration
outside
the
street
became
more
silent
because
deserted
from
the
thames
came
muffled
by
the
distance
the
distracted
voices
of
sirens
the
gasping
voices
of
marine
boilers
it
was
the
hour
when
the
two
friends
giving
themselves
over
to
dreaming
preserved
an
ineffable
silence
oh
i
see
them
so
clearly
said
madame
tiercelet
in
a
tone
of
admiration
and
that
how
evocative
it
is
applauded
the
countess
fergus
and
so
pure
kimberly
profited
by
these
flattering
interruptions
to
take
a
swallow
of
champagne
then
feeling
that
he
was
listened
to
with
more
passionate
attention
than
before
he
repeated
preserved
an
ineffable
silence
but
on
this
special
evening
farfadetti
murmured
have
a
poisoned
flower
in
my
heart
to
which
pinggleton
answered
evening
a
sorrowful
bird
has
been
singing
in
my
heart
the
studio
seemed
moved
by
this
unusual
colloquy
on
the
mauve
wall
which
was
gradually
losing
its
color
the
gold
algæ
seemed
to
spread
and
contract
and
to
spread
and
contract
again
in
harmony
with
the
new
rhythms
of
an
unusual
undulation
for
it
is
certain
that
the
soul
of
man
communicates
to
the
soul
of
things
its
troubles
its
passions
its
fervors
its
transgressions
its
life
how
true
that
is
this
cry
coming
from
several
mouths
at
once
did
not
prevent
kimberly
from
going
on
with
the
recital
which
thenceforth
was
to
unfold
itself
amid
the
silent
emotion
of
his
hearers
his
voice
became
even
more
mysterious
this
minute
of
silence
was
poignant
and
tragic
my
friend
implored
farfadetti
who
have
given
me
everything
you
whose
soul
is
so
marvelously
twin
with
mine
you
must
give
me
something
of
yourself
that
i
have
not
yet
had
and
from
the
lack
of
which
i
am
dying
it
then
my
life
that
you
ask
said
the
painter
is
yours
you
can
take
it
it
is
not
your
life
it
is
more
than
your
life
it
is
your
wife
cried
the
poet
botticellina
botticellinetta
flesh
of
your
flesh
the
soul
of
your
soul
the
dream
of
your
dream
the
magic
sleep
of
your
sorrows
alas
alas
it
was
to
be
you
have
drowned
yourself
in
her
she
has
drowned
herself
in
you
as
in
a
bottomless
lake
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
alas
alas
it
was
to
be
two
tears
phosphorescent
in
the
penumbra
rolled
from
the
eyes
of
the
painter
the
poet
answered
to
me
oh
my
friend
i
love
botticellina
and
botticellina
loves
me
and
we
shall
both
die
of
loving
one
another
and
of
not
daring
to
tell
one
another
and
of
not
daring
to
unite
she
and
i
are
two
fragments
long
ago
separated
of
one
and
the
same
living
being
which
for
perhaps
two
thousand
years
have
been
seeking
and
calling
one
another
and
which
meet
at
last
oh
my
dear
pinggleton
unknown
life
has
these
strange
terrible
and
delicious
fatalities
was
there
ever
a
more
splendid
poem
than
that
which
we
are
living
but
the
painter
kept
on
repeating
in
a
voice
more
and
more
sorrowful
this
cry
botticellina
he
rose
from
the
triple
row
of
cushions
upon
which
he
was
lying
and
walked
back
and
forth
in
the
studio
feverishly
after
some
minutes
of
anxious
agitation
he
said
was
mine
henceforth
must
she
be
thine
shall
be
ours
replied
the
poet
imperiously
god
has
chosen
you
to
be
the
point
of
suture
for
this
severed
soul
which
is
she
and
which
is
i
if
not
botticellina
possesses
the
magic
pearl
that
dissipates
dreams
i
the
dagger
that
delivers
from
corporeal
chains
if
you
refuse
we
shall
love
each
other
in
death
and
he
added
in
a
deep
tone
that
resounded
through
the
studio
like
a
voice
from
the
abyss
it
would
be
better
so
cried
the
painter
shall
live
botticellina
shall
be
thine
as
she
has
been
mine
i
will
tear
my
flesh
to
shreds
i
will
tear
my
heart
from
my
breast
i
will
break
my
head
against
the
wall
but
my
friend
shall
be
happy
i
can
suffer
suffering
too
is
voluptuousness
in
another
form
a
voluptuousness
more
powerful
more
bitter
more
fierce
than
any
other
exclaimed
farfadetti
ecstatically
envy
your
fate
do
you
know
as
for
me
i
really
believe
that
i
shall
die
either
of
the
joy
of
my
love
or
of
the
sorrow
of
my
friend
the
hour
has
come
adieu
he
rose
like
an
archangel
at
that
moment
the
drapery
moved
opening
and
closing
again
on
an
illuminating
apparition
it
was
botticellina
draped
in
a
flowing
robe
of
the
color
of
the
moonlight
her
floating
hair
shone
around
her
like
artificial
fire
in
her
hand
she
held
a
golden
key
an
ecstasy
was
on
her
lips
and
the
in
her
eyes
rushed
forward
and
disappeared
behind
the
drapery
then
pinggleton
lay
down
again
on
the
triple
row
of
cushions
of
the
color
of
and
while
he
buried
his
nails
in
his
flesh
and
while
the
blood
streamed
from
him
as
from
a
fountain
the
golden
algæ
now
scarcely
visible
gently
quivered
upon
the
wall
which
was
gradually
taking
on
a
coating
of
darkness
and
the
palette
and
the
easel
resounded
long
and
long
in
nuptial
songs
for
some
moments
kimberly
was
silent
then
while
the
emotion
that
prevailed
around
the
table
was
choking
throats
and
compressing
hearts
he
concluded
and
this
is
why
i
have
dipped
the
point
of
my
golden
knife
in
the
preserves
prepared
by
kanaka
virgins
in
honor
of
a
betrothal
more
magnificent
than
any
that
our
century
in
its
ignorance
of
beauty
has
ever
known
the
dinner
was
over
they
rose
from
the
table
in
religious
silence
but
thrilled
through
and
through
in
the
kimberly
was
closely
surrounded
and
warmly
congratulated
the
looks
of
all
the
women
converged
radiantly
upon
his
painted
face
surrounding
it
with
a
halo
of
ecstasies
ah
i
should
so
like
to
have
my
portrait
painted
by
pinggleton
cried
mme
de
rambure
i
would
give
anything
to
enjoy
such
happiness
alas
madame
answered
kimberly
since
the
sorrowful
and
sublime
event
which
i
have
related
pinggleton
has
been
unwilling
to
paint
human
faces
however
charming
they
may
be
he
paints
only
souls
and
he
is
right
i
should
so
like
to
be
painted
as
a
soul
of
what
sex
asked
maurice
fernancourt
in
a
slightly
sarcastic
tone
visibly
jealous
of
kimberly
success
the
latter
said
simply
souls
have
no
sex
my
dear
maurice
they
have
hair
on
their
paws
said
victor
charrigaud
in
a
very
low
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
only
by
the
psychological
novelist
to
whom
he
was
just
then
offering
a
cigar
and
dragging
him
into
the
he
whispered
ah
old
man
i
wish
i
could
shout
the
most
filthy
things
at
the
top
of
my
voice
in
the
faces
of
all
these
people
i
have
enough
of
their
souls
of
their
green
and
perverse
loves
of
their
magic
preserves
yes
yes
to
say
the
coarsest
things
to
besmear
one
self
with
good
black
fetid
mud
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
oh
how
exquisite
that
would
be
and
how
restful
and
how
it
would
relieve
me
of
all
these
nauseating
lilies
that
they
have
put
into
my
heart
and
you
but
the
shock
had
been
too
great
and
the
impression
of
recital
remained
they
could
no
longer
interest
themselves
in
the
vulgar
things
of
earth
in
topics
of
society
art
and
passion
the
viscount
lahyrais
himself
clubman
sportsman
gambler
and
trickster
felt
wings
sprouting
all
over
him
each
one
felt
the
need
of
collecting
his
thoughts
of
being
alone
of
prolonging
the
dream
of
realizing
it
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
kimberly
who
went
from
one
to
another
asking
did
you
ever
drink
sable
milk
ah
then
drink
sable
milk
it
is
ravishing
the
conversation
could
not
be
resumed
so
that
one
after
another
the
guests
excused
themselves
and
slipped
away
at
eleven
all
had
gone
when
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
alone
monsieur
and
madame
looked
at
each
other
for
a
long
time
steadily
and
with
hostility
before
exchanging
their
impressions
for
a
pretty
fizzle
you
know
it
is
a
pretty
fizzle
declared
monsieur
it
is
your
fault
said
madame
in
a
tone
of
bitter
reproach
well
that
a
good
one
yes
your
fault
you
paid
no
attention
to
anything
you
did
nothing
but
roll
dirty
pellets
of
bread
in
your
fat
fingers
nobody
could
get
a
word
out
of
you
how
ridiculous
you
were
it
is
shameful
well
you
need
talk
rejoined
monsieur
and
your
green
gown
and
your
smiles
and
your
blunders
it
was
i
perhaps
it
was
i
undoubtedly
who
told
of
pinggleton
sorrow
who
ate
kanaka
preserves
who
painted
souls
i
doubtless
am
the
you
are
not
even
capable
of
being
cried
madame
at
the
height
of
her
exasperation
for
a
long
time
they
hurled
insults
at
one
another
and
madame
after
having
arranged
the
silverware
and
the
opened
bottles
in
the
sideboard
took
herself
off
to
her
room
and
shut
herself
up
monsieur
continued
to
roam
about
the
house
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
suddenly
noticing
me
in
the
where
i
was
putting
things
a
little
to
rights
he
came
to
me
and
taking
me
about
the
waist
he
said
ah
célestine
you
do
not
know
the
immense
delight
that
you
give
me
to
see
a
woman
who
is
not
a
soul
to
touch
a
woman
who
is
not
a
lily
kiss
me
you
may
judge
whether
i
was
expecting
that
but
the
next
day
when
they
read
in
the
figaro
an
article
in
which
their
dinner
their
elegance
their
taste
their
wit
and
their
social
connections
were
pompously
celebrated
they
forgot
everything
and
talked
of
nothing
but
their
great
success
and
their
soul
set
sail
for
more
illustrious
conquests
and
more
sumptuous
snobberies
what
a
charming
woman
is
the
countess
fergus
said
madame
at
lunch
as
they
were
finishing
the
leavings
of
the
dinner
and
what
a
soul
said
monsieur
in
confirmation
and
kimberly
would
you
believe
it
there
an
astonishing
talker
for
you
and
so
exquisite
in
his
manners
it
is
a
mistake
to
make
sport
of
him
after
all
his
vice
concerns
no
one
but
himself
it
is
none
of
our
business
certainly
not
and
she
added
indulgently
ah
if
it
were
necessary
to
pick
everybody
to
pieces
all
day
long
in
the
i
have
amused
myself
in
calling
up
the
queer
things
that
happened
in
that
house
the
passion
for
notoriety
with
which
from
that
time
madame
was
so
filled
that
she
would
prostitute
herself
to
all
the
dirty
journalists
who
would
promise
her
an
article
on
her
husband
books
or
a
word
about
her
costumes
and
her
and
monsieur
complacency
in
letting
this
vile
conduct
go
on
though
perfectly
aware
of
it
with
admirable
cynicism
he
said
at
any
rate
it
is
less
expensive
than
paying
by
the
line
at
the
newspaper
offices
monsieur
on
his
side
fell
to
the
lowest
depths
of
baseness
and
unscrupulousness
he
called
that
the
politics
of
the
and
society
diplomacy
i
am
going
to
write
to
paris
to
have
them
send
me
my
old
master
new
book
but
how
rotten
it
must
be
at
bottom
xi
now
all
talk
of
the
little
claire
has
ceased
as
was
expected
the
case
has
been
abandoned
so
joseph
and
the
forest
of
raillon
will
keep
their
secret
forever
of
that
poor
little
human
creature
no
more
will
be
said
henceforth
than
of
the
body
of
a
blackbird
that
dies
in
the
woods
in
a
thicket
the
father
continues
to
break
stone
on
the
highway
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
the
town
stirred
and
roused
for
a
moment
by
this
crime
resumes
its
usual
aspect
an
aspect
still
more
dismal
because
of
the
winter
the
very
bitter
cold
keeps
people
shut
up
in
their
houses
one
can
scarcely
get
a
glimpse
of
their
pale
and
sleepy
faces
behind
the
frosty
windows
and
in
the
streets
one
seldom
meets
anybody
except
ragged
vagabonds
and
shivering
dogs
madame
sent
me
on
an
errand
to
the
butcher
shop
and
i
took
the
dogs
with
me
while
i
was
there
an
old
woman
timidly
entered
the
shop
and
asked
for
meat
a
little
meat
to
make
a
little
soup
for
my
sick
boy
the
butcher
selected
from
the
piled
up
in
a
large
copper
pan
a
dirty
bit
half
bone
half
fat
and
after
carefully
weighing
it
announced
fifteen
sous
fifteen
sous
exclaimed
the
old
woman
but
that
is
impossible
and
how
do
you
expect
me
to
make
soup
out
of
that
as
you
like
said
the
butcher
throwing
the
piece
back
into
the
pan
only
you
know
i
am
going
to
send
you
your
bill
if
it
is
not
paid
by
then
the
give
it
to
me
said
the
old
woman
then
with
resignation
when
she
had
gone
the
butcher
explained
to
me
nevertheless
if
we
did
not
have
the
poor
to
buy
the
inferior
parts
we
really
should
not
make
enough
out
of
an
animal
but
these
wretches
are
getting
to
be
very
exacting
nowadays
and
cutting
off
two
long
slices
of
good
red
meat
he
threw
them
to
the
dogs
the
dogs
of
the
rich
indeed
they
are
not
poor
at
the
priory
events
succeed
one
another
from
the
tragic
they
pass
to
the
comical
for
one
can
not
always
shudder
tired
of
the
and
acting
on
madame
advice
monsieur
has
at
last
brought
suit
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
he
claims
damages
and
interest
for
the
breaking
of
his
and
his
frames
and
for
the
devastation
of
the
garden
it
seems
that
the
meeting
of
the
two
enemies
in
the
office
of
the
justice
was
really
something
epic
they
blackguarded
one
another
like
of
course
the
captain
denies
with
many
oaths
that
he
has
ever
thrown
stones
or
anything
else
into
lanlaire
garden
it
is
lanlaire
who
throws
stones
into
his
have
you
witnesses
where
are
your
witnesses
dare
to
produce
witnesses
screams
the
captain
witnesses
rejoins
monsieur
there
are
the
stones
and
all
the
dirty
things
with
which
you
have
been
continually
covering
my
land
there
are
the
old
hats
and
the
old
slippers
that
i
pick
up
every
day
and
that
everybody
recognizes
as
having
belonged
to
you
you
lie
you
are
a
scoundrel
a
drunken
rake
but
it
being
impossible
for
monsieur
to
bring
admissible
and
conclusive
testimony
the
justice
of
the
peace
who
moreover
is
the
captain
friend
invites
monsieur
to
withdraw
his
complaint
and
for
that
matter
permit
me
to
say
to
you
concluded
the
magistrate
it
is
highly
improbable
it
is
quite
inadmissible
that
a
valiant
soldier
an
intrepid
officer
who
has
won
all
his
stripes
on
fields
of
battle
amuses
himself
in
throwing
stones
and
old
hats
upon
your
land
like
a
small
boy
egad
vociferates
the
captain
this
man
is
an
infamous
dreyfusard
he
insults
the
army
i
yes
you
what
you
are
trying
to
do
you
dirty
jew
is
to
disgrace
the
army
long
live
the
army
they
came
near
taking
each
other
by
the
hair
and
the
justice
had
much
difficulty
in
separating
them
since
then
monsieur
has
stationed
permanently
in
the
garden
two
invisible
witnesses
behind
a
sort
of
board
shelter
in
which
are
pierced
at
the
height
of
a
man
four
round
holes
for
the
eyes
but
the
captain
being
warned
is
lying
low
and
monsieur
is
out
the
cost
of
his
watchers
i
have
seen
the
captain
two
or
three
times
over
the
hedge
in
spite
of
the
frost
he
stays
in
his
garden
all
day
long
working
furiously
at
all
sorts
of
things
for
the
moment
he
is
putting
caps
on
his
he
tells
me
of
his
misfortunes
rose
is
suffering
from
an
attack
of
influenza
and
then
with
her
asthma
bourbaki
is
dead
he
died
of
a
congestion
of
the
lungs
from
drinking
too
much
cognac
really
the
captain
has
no
luck
and
surely
that
bandit
of
a
lanlaire
has
cast
a
spell
over
him
he
wishes
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
him
to
rid
the
country
of
him
and
he
submits
to
me
an
astonishing
plan
of
campaign
here
is
what
you
ought
to
do
mademoiselle
célestine
you
ought
to
lodge
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
louviers
a
complaint
against
lanlaire
for
outrages
on
morals
and
an
assault
on
modesty
ah
an
idea
but
captain
monsieur
has
never
outraged
my
morals
or
assaulted
my
modesty
well
what
difference
does
that
make
i
can
not
what
you
can
not
but
there
is
nothing
simpler
lodge
your
complaint
and
summon
rose
and
me
we
will
come
to
declare
to
certify
in
a
court
of
justice
that
we
have
seen
everything
everything
everything
a
soldier
word
amounts
to
something
especially
just
now
thunder
of
god
and
remember
that
after
that
it
will
be
easy
to
rake
up
the
case
of
little
claire
and
involve
lanlaire
in
it
ah
that
an
idea
think
it
over
mademoiselle
célestine
think
it
over
ah
i
have
many
things
much
too
many
things
to
think
over
just
now
joseph
is
pressing
me
for
a
decision
the
matter
can
not
be
postponed
he
has
heard
from
cherbourg
that
the
little
café
is
to
be
sold
next
week
but
i
am
anxious
troubled
i
want
to
and
i
do
want
to
one
day
the
idea
pleases
me
and
the
next
it
does
i
really
believe
that
i
am
afraid
that
joseph
wants
to
drag
me
into
terrible
things
i
can
not
come
to
a
decision
he
is
not
brutal
in
his
method
of
persuasion
he
advances
arguments
and
tempts
me
with
promises
of
liberty
of
handsome
costumes
of
secure
happy
triumphant
life
but
i
must
buy
the
little
café
he
says
to
me
i
can
not
let
such
an
opportunity
go
by
and
if
the
revolution
comes
think
of
it
célestine
that
means
fortune
right
away
and
who
knows
the
revolution
ah
bear
that
in
mind
is
the
best
thing
possible
for
the
cafés
buy
it
at
any
rate
if
it
is
not
i
it
will
be
somebody
else
no
no
it
must
be
you
nobody
else
will
do
i
am
crazy
over
you
but
you
distrust
me
no
joseph
i
assure
you
yes
yes
you
have
bad
ideas
about
me
i
do
not
know
no
really
i
do
not
know
where
at
that
moment
i
found
the
courage
to
ask
him
well
joseph
tell
me
that
it
was
you
who
outraged
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
joseph
received
the
shock
with
extraordinary
tranquillity
he
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
swayed
back
and
forth
a
few
seconds
and
then
giving
a
hitch
to
his
pantaloons
which
had
slipped
a
little
he
answered
simply
you
see
did
i
not
tell
you
so
i
know
your
thoughts
i
know
everything
that
goes
on
in
your
mind
his
voice
was
softer
but
his
look
had
become
so
terrifying
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
articulate
a
word
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
little
claire
it
is
a
question
of
you
he
took
me
in
his
arms
as
he
did
the
other
evening
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
little
café
shuddering
and
trembling
i
found
strength
to
answer
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
of
you
joseph
why
am
i
afraid
of
you
he
held
me
cradled
in
his
arms
and
disdaining
to
justify
himself
happy
perhaps
at
increasing
my
terrors
he
said
to
me
in
a
paternal
tone
well
well
since
that
is
the
case
i
will
talk
with
you
again
about
it
a
rouen
newspaper
is
circulating
in
town
in
which
there
is
an
article
that
is
creating
a
scandal
among
the
pious
it
is
a
true
story
very
droll
and
somewhat
which
happened
lately
at
a
pretty
place
situated
three
leagues
from
here
and
it
gains
in
piquancy
from
the
fact
that
everybody
knows
the
personages
here
again
is
something
for
people
to
talk
about
for
a
few
days
the
newspaper
was
brought
to
marianne
yesterday
and
at
night
after
dinner
i
read
the
famous
article
aloud
at
the
first
phrases
joseph
rose
with
much
dignity
very
severe
and
even
a
little
angry
he
declared
that
he
does
not
like
dirty
stories
and
that
he
can
not
sit
and
listen
to
attacks
on
religion
you
are
not
behaving
well
in
reading
that
célestine
you
are
not
behaving
well
and
he
went
off
to
bed
november
it
took
us
all
day
to
clean
the
silver
service
that
is
an
event
in
the
house
a
traditional
epoch
like
the
season
the
lanlaires
possess
a
magnificent
silver
service
containing
old
pieces
rare
and
very
beautiful
it
comes
from
madame
father
who
took
it
some
say
on
deposit
others
say
as
security
for
money
lent
to
a
neighboring
member
of
the
nobility
young
people
for
military
service
were
not
all
that
this
blusterer
bought
everything
was
fish
that
came
to
his
net
and
one
swindle
more
or
less
made
no
difference
to
him
if
the
grocer
is
to
be
believed
the
story
of
this
silver
service
is
one
of
the
most
doubtful
or
one
of
the
clearest
as
you
choose
to
look
at
it
it
is
said
that
madame
father
got
his
money
back
and
then
thanks
to
some
circumstance
the
nature
of
which
i
do
not
know
succeeded
in
keeping
the
silver
service
in
the
bargain
an
astonishing
piece
of
sharp
practice
of
course
the
lanlaires
never
use
it
it
remains
locked
up
at
the
back
of
a
closet
in
the
servants
hall
in
three
great
boxes
lined
with
red
velvet
and
fastened
to
the
wall
by
solid
iron
clamps
every
year
on
the
tenth
of
november
it
is
taken
from
the
boxes
and
cleaned
under
madame
supervision
and
it
is
never
seen
again
until
the
following
year
oh
madame
eyes
in
presence
of
her
silver
service
her
silver
service
in
our
hands
never
have
i
seen
in
a
woman
eyes
such
aggressive
cupidity
are
they
not
curious
these
people
who
hide
everything
who
bury
their
silver
their
jewels
all
their
wealth
all
their
happiness
and
who
being
able
to
live
in
luxury
and
joy
persist
in
living
a
life
of
ennui
bordering
on
deprivation
the
work
done
the
silver
service
locked
up
for
a
year
in
its
boxes
and
madame
having
gone
away
after
satisfying
herself
that
none
of
it
has
stuck
to
our
fingers
joseph
said
to
me
with
a
queer
air
that
is
a
very
beautiful
silver
service
you
know
célestine
especially
cruet
of
louis
xvi
ah
and
how
heavy
it
is
the
whole
business
is
worth
perhaps
thousand
francs
célestine
perhaps
more
one
does
not
know
what
it
is
worth
and
looking
at
me
steadily
and
heavily
piercing
the
very
depths
of
my
soul
he
asked
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
little
café
what
relation
can
there
be
between
madame
silver
service
and
the
little
café
at
cherbourg
really
i
do
know
why
but
slightest
words
make
me
tremble
xii
i
have
said
that
i
would
speak
of
xavier
the
memory
of
this
boy
pursues
me
runs
continually
through
my
head
among
so
many
faces
his
is
one
of
those
that
come
back
most
frequently
to
my
mind
sometimes
with
regret
sometimes
with
anger
all
the
same
he
was
prettily
droll
and
prettily
vicious
xavier
with
his
irregular
features
and
his
blonde
and
brazen
face
ah
the
little
rascal
really
one
may
say
of
him
that
he
belonged
to
his
epoch
one
day
i
was
engaged
as
chambermaid
by
mme
de
tarves
in
the
rue
de
varennes
a
establishment
an
elegant
retinue
and
handsome
wages
a
hundred
francs
a
month
with
washing
and
wine
and
everything
included
the
morning
that
i
arrived
at
the
house
in
a
highly
satisfied
state
of
mind
madame
had
me
shown
into
her
an
astonishing
room
hung
with
cream
silk
and
madame
a
tall
woman
extremely
made
up
her
skin
too
white
her
lips
too
red
her
hair
too
blonde
but
nevertheless
pretty
rustling
with
an
imposing
presence
and
style
so
much
was
not
to
be
gainsaid
i
already
possessed
a
very
keen
eye
even
from
rapidly
passing
through
a
parisian
interior
i
was
able
to
judge
of
its
habits
and
morals
and
although
furniture
lies
as
well
as
faces
i
was
rarely
mistaken
in
spite
of
the
sumptuous
and
decent
appearance
of
this
establishment
i
felt
at
once
the
disorganization
that
prevailed
there
the
broken
ties
the
intrigue
the
haste
the
feverish
life
the
private
and
hidden
filth
not
sufficiently
hidden
however
to
prevent
me
from
detecting
the
odor
always
the
same
moreover
in
the
first
looks
exchanged
between
new
and
old
servants
there
is
a
sort
of
masonic
sign
generally
spontaneous
and
involuntary
which
immediately
informs
you
regarding
the
general
spirit
of
the
establishment
as
in
all
other
professions
servants
are
very
jealous
of
each
other
and
they
defend
themselves
ferociously
against
even
i
who
am
so
easy
in
my
ways
have
suffered
from
these
jealousies
and
hatreds
especially
on
the
part
of
women
who
were
enraged
at
my
beauty
but
for
the
contrary
reason
men
i
must
do
them
this
justice
have
always
welcomed
me
cordially
in
the
look
of
the
de
who
had
opened
the
door
for
me
at
the
house
of
mme
de
tarves
i
had
clearly
read
these
words
this
is
a
queer
box
with
ups
and
downs
nothing
like
security
but
plenty
of
fun
all
the
same
you
can
come
in
my
little
one
so
in
making
my
way
to
the
i
was
prepared
to
the
extent
of
these
uncertain
and
summary
impressions
for
something
peculiar
but
i
must
confess
that
i
had
no
idea
of
that
which
really
awaited
me
madame
was
writing
letters
at
a
little
jewel
of
a
desk
a
large
skin
of
white
astrachan
served
as
a
carpet
for
the
room
on
the
cream
silk
walls
i
was
astonished
to
see
engravings
of
the
eighteenth
century
more
than
licentious
almost
obscene
not
very
far
from
the
very
old
enamels
representing
religious
scenes
in
a
glass
cabinet
a
quantity
of
old
jewels
ivories
miniature
and
gallant
little
saxon
porcelains
deliciously
fragile
on
a
table
toilet
articles
very
rich
of
gold
and
silver
a
little
yellow
dog
a
ball
of
silky
and
shiny
hair
was
asleep
on
a
long
chair
between
two
mauve
silk
cushions
madame
said
to
me
célestine
is
it
not
ah
i
do
not
like
that
name
at
all
i
will
call
you
mary
in
english
mary
you
will
remember
mary
yes
that
is
more
suitable
that
is
in
the
order
of
things
we
servants
have
not
a
right
even
to
a
name
of
our
own
because
in
all
the
houses
there
are
daughters
cousins
dogs
and
parrots
that
have
the
same
name
that
we
have
very
well
madame
i
answered
do
you
know
english
mary
no
madame
i
have
already
told
madame
so
ah
to
be
sure
i
regret
it
turn
a
little
mary
that
i
may
look
at
you
she
examined
me
from
every
point
of
view
front
back
and
profile
murmuring
from
time
to
time
well
she
is
not
bad
she
is
rather
and
suddenly
tell
me
mary
have
you
a
good
figure
a
very
good
figure
this
question
surprised
and
disturbed
me
i
did
not
grasp
the
connection
between
my
service
in
the
house
and
the
shape
of
my
body
but
without
waiting
for
my
reply
madame
said
talking
to
herself
and
surveying
my
entire
person
from
head
to
foot
through
her
yes
she
seems
to
have
a
good
figure
enough
then
addressing
me
directly
she
exclaimed
with
a
satisfied
smile
you
see
mary
i
like
to
have
about
me
only
women
with
good
figures
it
is
more
suitable
i
was
not
at
the
end
of
my
surprises
continuing
to
examine
me
minutely
she
cried
suddenly
oh
your
hair
i
desire
you
to
do
your
hair
otherwise
your
hair
is
not
done
with
elegance
you
have
beautiful
hair
you
should
make
the
most
of
it
a
fine
head
of
hair
is
a
very
important
matter
see
like
that
something
in
that
style
she
dishevelled
a
little
the
hair
on
my
forehead
repeating
something
in
that
style
she
is
charming
see
mary
you
are
charming
it
is
more
suitable
and
while
she
was
patting
my
hair
i
asked
myself
if
madame
was
not
a
little
off
when
she
had
finished
being
satisfied
with
my
hair
she
asked
is
that
your
prettiest
gown
yes
madame
it
is
not
much
your
prettiest
gown
i
will
give
you
some
of
mine
which
you
can
make
over
and
your
underwear
she
raised
my
skirt
and
turned
it
up
slightly
yes
i
see
said
she
that
will
not
do
at
all
and
your
linen
is
it
suitable
vexed
by
this
invasive
inspection
i
answered
in
a
dry
voice
i
do
not
know
what
madame
means
by
suitable
show
me
your
linen
go
and
get
me
your
linen
and
walk
a
little
again
come
back
turn
round
she
walks
well
she
has
style
as
soon
as
she
saw
my
linen
she
made
a
face
oh
this
cotton
cloth
these
stockings
these
chemises
horrible
and
this
corset
i
do
not
wish
to
see
that
in
my
house
i
do
not
wish
you
to
wear
that
in
my
house
wait
mary
help
me
she
opened
a
pink
lacker
wardrobe
pulled
out
a
large
drawer
full
of
fragrant
garments
and
emptied
its
contents
on
the
carpet
take
that
mary
take
it
all
you
will
see
there
are
some
stitches
to
be
taken
some
repairs
to
be
made
some
little
places
to
be
mended
you
will
attend
to
that
take
it
all
there
is
a
little
of
everything
there
is
enough
there
to
fit
you
out
with
a
pretty
wardrobe
a
suitable
take
it
all
indeed
there
was
everything
silk
corsets
silk
stockings
silk
and
fine
linen
chemises
loves
of
drawers
delicious
ruffs
and
ornamented
petticoats
a
strong
odor
an
odor
of
of
jasmine
of
woman
in
short
an
odor
of
love
rose
from
these
garments
whose
soft
faded
or
violent
colors
glistened
on
the
carpet
like
a
basket
of
flowers
in
a
garden
i
could
not
get
over
it
i
stood
thoroughly
stupefied
contented
and
embarrassed
at
once
before
this
pile
of
pink
mauve
yellow
and
red
stuffs
in
which
there
still
were
ribbons
of
brighter
shades
and
delicate
bits
of
lace
and
madame
stirred
up
these
old
things
that
were
still
so
pretty
these
undergarments
that
were
scarcely
worn
showed
them
to
me
selected
for
me
and
advised
me
indicating
her
preferences
i
like
the
women
in
my
service
to
be
coquettish
elegant
i
like
to
have
them
smell
good
you
are
a
brunette
here
is
a
red
skirt
that
will
become
you
marvelously
moreover
all
these
things
will
become
you
very
well
take
them
all
i
was
in
a
state
of
profound
stupefaction
i
knew
not
what
to
do
i
knew
not
what
to
say
mechanically
i
repeated
thank
you
madame
how
good
madame
is
thank
you
madame
but
madame
did
not
leave
me
time
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
my
own
thoughts
she
talked
and
talked
by
turns
familiar
shameless
maternal
pandering
and
so
strange
it
is
like
cleanliness
mary
care
of
the
body
private
toilets
oh
i
insist
upon
that
above
all
things
on
this
point
i
am
exacting
exacting
to
the
point
of
mania
she
entered
into
intimate
details
insisting
always
on
this
word
suitable
that
came
back
continually
to
her
lips
apropos
of
things
that
were
scarcely
so
at
least
to
my
thinking
as
we
finished
our
sorting
of
the
garments
she
said
to
me
a
woman
no
matter
what
woman
should
always
be
well
kept
for
the
rest
mary
you
will
do
as
i
do
this
is
a
point
of
capital
importance
take
a
bath
i
will
show
you
then
madame
took
me
to
her
room
showed
me
her
closets
her
hangings
the
place
for
everything
familiarized
me
with
the
service
all
the
time
making
remarks
that
seemed
to
me
queer
and
not
natural
now
said
she
let
us
go
to
xavier
room
that
too
will
be
in
your
charge
xavier
is
my
son
mary
very
well
madame
xavier
room
was
situated
at
the
other
end
of
the
vast
apartment
a
coquettish
room
hung
in
blue
cloth
with
yellow
trimmings
on
the
walls
colored
english
engravings
representing
hunting
and
racing
scenes
teams
châteaux
a
stood
in
front
of
a
panel
a
real
panoply
of
canes
with
a
in
the
middle
flanked
by
two
trumpets
crossed
on
the
mantel
among
many
bibelots
and
pipes
a
photograph
of
a
pretty
boy
very
young
and
still
beardless
with
the
insolent
face
of
a
precocious
dude
and
the
uncertain
grace
of
a
girl
the
whole
producing
an
effect
that
pleased
me
that
is
xavier
said
madame
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
undoubtedly
with
too
much
warmth
oh
what
a
handsome
boy
well
well
mary
exclaimed
madame
i
saw
that
my
exclamation
had
not
offended
her
for
she
had
smiled
xavier
is
like
all
young
people
she
said
to
me
he
is
not
very
orderly
you
must
be
orderly
for
him
and
his
room
must
be
perfectly
kept
you
will
enter
the
room
every
morning
at
nine
you
will
bring
him
his
tea
at
nine
you
understand
mary
sometimes
xavier
comes
home
late
perhaps
he
will
not
receive
you
well
in
the
morning
but
that
makes
no
difference
a
young
man
should
be
awakened
at
nine
she
showed
me
where
xavier
kept
his
linen
his
cravats
his
shoes
accompanying
each
detail
with
some
remark
like
this
my
son
is
a
little
sharp
but
he
is
a
charming
child
or
else
do
you
know
how
to
fold
pantaloons
oh
xavier
is
especially
particular
about
his
pantaloons
as
for
the
hats
it
was
agreed
that
i
need
pay
no
attention
to
them
the
glory
of
their
daily
ironing
belonging
to
the
de
i
found
it
extremely
odd
that
in
a
house
where
there
was
a
de
madame
should
select
me
to
serve
xavier
it
is
funny
but
perhaps
it
is
not
very
suitable
i
said
to
myself
parodying
the
word
which
my
mistress
was
constantly
repeating
apropos
of
no
matter
what
it
is
true
that
everything
seemed
odd
to
me
in
this
odd
house
in
the
evening
in
the
servants
hall
i
learned
many
things
an
extraordinary
box
they
explained
to
me
it
is
very
astonishing
at
first
and
then
you
get
used
to
it
sometimes
there
is
a
sou
in
the
whole
house
then
madame
goes
comes
runs
goes
away
and
comes
back
again
nervous
tired
her
mouth
filled
with
high
words
as
for
monsieur
he
never
leaves
the
telephone
he
shouts
threatens
begs
and
raises
the
devil
through
the
instrument
and
the
it
has
often
happened
that
the
butler
had
to
give
something
out
of
his
own
pocket
on
account
to
furious
tradesmen
who
were
unwilling
to
supply
anything
more
on
one
reception
day
the
electricity
and
gas
were
cut
off
and
then
suddenly
there
comes
a
rain
of
gold
the
house
is
overflowing
with
wealth
where
does
it
come
from
that
nobody
knows
exactly
as
for
the
servants
they
wait
months
and
months
for
their
wages
but
they
are
always
paid
at
last
only
after
what
scenes
after
what
insults
after
what
squabbles
it
is
incredible
well
indeed
a
nice
place
i
had
tumbled
into
and
such
was
my
luck
for
the
one
time
in
my
life
when
i
had
good
wages
xavier
has
not
yet
come
in
said
the
de
oh
exclaimed
the
cook
looking
at
me
persistently
perhaps
he
will
return
now
and
the
de
related
that
that
very
morning
a
creditor
of
xavier
had
come
again
to
raise
a
row
it
must
have
been
a
very
dirty
matter
for
monsieur
had
sung
small
and
had
been
obliged
to
pay
a
heavy
sum
at
least
four
thousand
francs
monsieur
was
in
a
pretty
rage
he
added
i
heard
him
say
to
madame
can
not
last
he
will
disgrace
us
he
will
disgrace
us
the
cook
who
seemed
very
philosophical
shrugged
her
shoulders
disgrace
them
said
she
with
a
chuckle
little
they
care
about
that
it
is
the
having
to
pay
that
bothers
them
this
conversation
made
me
ill
at
ease
i
understood
vaguely
that
there
might
be
some
relation
between
madame
garments
madame
words
and
xavier
but
exactly
what
it
is
having
to
pay
that
bothers
them
i
did
not
sleep
at
all
well
that
night
haunted
by
strange
dreams
and
impatient
to
see
xavier
the
de
had
not
lied
a
queer
box
indeed
monsieur
was
in
the
pilgrimages
i
do
know
exactly
what
president
director
or
something
of
that
sort
he
picked
up
pilgrims
where
he
could
among
the
jews
the
protestants
the
vagabonds
even
among
the
catholics
and
once
a
year
he
took
these
people
to
rome
to
lourdes
to
not
without
gaining
notoriety
and
profit
of
course
the
pope
did
see
through
it
and
religion
triumphed
monsieur
occupied
himself
also
with
charitable
and
political
works
the
league
against
secular
education
the
league
against
obscene
publications
the
society
of
amusing
and
christian
libraries
the
society
for
the
collection
of
congreganist
for
the
nursing
of
working
people
children
and
any
number
of
others
he
presided
over
orphan
asylums
alumnæ
convents
clubs
he
presided
over
everything
oh
the
trades
that
he
had
he
was
a
plump
little
man
very
lively
very
neat
very
whose
manners
at
the
same
time
sugary
and
cynical
were
those
of
a
shrewd
priest
full
of
the
devil
sometimes
the
newspapers
contained
references
to
him
and
his
works
naturally
some
of
them
extolled
his
humanitarian
virtues
and
his
high
apostolic
sanctity
others
treated
him
as
an
old
rascal
and
a
dirty
scoundrel
in
the
servants
hall
we
were
much
amused
over
these
quarrels
although
it
is
rather
and
flattering
to
be
in
the
service
of
masters
who
are
talked
about
in
the
newspapers
every
week
monsieur
gave
a
grand
dinner
followed
by
a
grand
reception
which
were
attended
by
celebrities
of
all
sorts
academicians
reactionary
senators
catholic
deputies
recalcitrant
priests
intriguing
monks
and
archbishops
there
was
one
especially
to
whom
they
paid
especial
attention
a
very
old
assumptionist
father
something
or
other
a
sanctimonious
and
venomous
man
who
was
always
saying
spiteful
things
with
a
contrite
and
pious
air
and
everywhere
in
every
room
there
were
portraits
of
the
pope
ah
he
must
have
seen
some
tall
things
in
that
house
the
holy
father
for
my
part
monsieur
was
not
to
my
liking
he
did
too
many
things
he
loved
too
many
people
and
yet
nobody
knew
half
the
things
that
he
did
and
half
the
people
that
he
loved
surely
he
was
a
sly
old
dog
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
as
i
was
helping
him
to
put
on
his
overcoat
in
the
he
asked
me
do
you
belong
to
my
society
the
society
of
the
servants
of
jesus
no
monsieur
you
must
join
it
it
is
indispensable
i
am
going
to
enter
your
name
thank
you
monsieur
may
i
ask
monsieur
what
this
society
is
an
admirable
society
which
takes
in
girl
mothers
and
gives
them
a
christian
education
but
monsieur
i
am
not
a
girl
mother
that
makes
no
difference
there
are
also
women
just
out
of
prison
there
are
repentant
prostitutes
there
is
a
little
of
everything
i
am
going
to
enter
your
name
he
took
from
his
pocket
some
newspapers
and
handed
them
to
me
hide
these
read
them
when
you
are
alone
they
are
very
curious
and
he
chucked
me
under
the
chin
saying
with
a
slight
clack
of
his
tongue
ah
she
is
a
queer
little
one
yes
indeed
a
very
queer
little
one
when
monsieur
had
gone
i
looked
at
the
newspapers
that
he
had
left
with
me
they
were
the
fin
de
siècle
the
rigolo
the
petites
femmes
de
paris
dirty
sheets
indeed
oh
the
what
an
eternal
farce
i
have
seen
many
of
them
and
of
the
most
different
kinds
they
are
all
alike
for
instance
i
was
once
a
domestic
in
the
house
of
a
republican
deputy
he
spent
his
time
in
railing
at
the
priests
a
blower
indeed
you
should
have
seen
him
he
would
not
hear
a
word
about
religion
or
the
pope
or
the
good
sisters
if
people
had
listened
to
him
they
would
have
overturned
all
the
churches
and
blown
up
all
the
convents
well
on
sunday
he
went
to
mass
secretly
in
parishes
at
the
slightest
ailment
he
sent
for
the
priests
and
all
his
children
were
brought
up
by
the
jesuits
he
would
never
consent
to
meet
his
brother
after
the
latter
refusal
to
marry
in
church
all
hypocrites
all
cowards
all
disgusting
each
in
his
own
way
madame
de
tarves
was
also
in
the
charity
line
she
too
presided
over
religious
committees
and
benevolent
societies
and
organized
charity
sales
that
is
to
say
she
was
never
at
home
and
things
in
the
house
went
on
as
they
could
very
often
madame
returned
late
coming
from
the
devil
knows
where
oh
i
know
these
returns
they
directly
acquainted
me
with
the
sort
of
works
in
which
madame
was
engaged
and
with
the
queer
capers
that
were
cut
in
her
committees
but
she
was
nice
with
me
never
an
abrupt
word
never
a
reproach
on
the
contrary
she
treated
me
familiarly
almost
like
a
comrade
and
so
far
did
she
carry
this
that
sometimes
she
forgetting
her
dignity
and
i
my
respect
we
talked
nonsense
together
and
said
things
she
gave
me
advice
as
to
the
arrangement
of
my
little
affairs
encouraged
my
coquettish
tastes
deluged
me
with
glycerine
and
covered
my
arms
with
cold
cream
and
sprinkled
me
with
powder
and
during
these
operations
she
was
continually
saying
you
see
mary
a
woman
must
be
well
groomed
her
skin
must
be
white
and
soft
you
have
a
pretty
face
you
must
learn
how
to
set
it
off
you
have
a
very
fine
bust
you
must
give
it
its
full
value
your
legs
are
superb
you
must
be
able
to
show
them
it
is
more
suitable
i
was
content
yet
within
i
still
was
not
free
from
anxiety
and
obscure
suspicions
i
could
not
forget
the
surprising
stories
that
they
told
me
in
the
servants
hall
there
when
i
praised
madame
and
enumerated
her
kindnesses
toward
me
the
cook
said
yes
yes
that
all
right
but
wait
and
see
what
follows
what
she
wants
of
you
is
to
be
intimate
with
her
son
that
he
may
be
kept
in
the
house
more
and
thus
may
cost
these
curmudgeons
less
money
she
has
already
tried
that
with
others
she
has
even
induced
friends
of
hers
to
come
here
married
women
young
girls
yes
young
girls
the
trollop
but
xavier
does
not
fall
in
with
this
he
prefers
to
roam
elsewhere
you
will
see
you
will
see
and
she
added
with
a
sort
of
hateful
regret
if
i
were
in
your
place
how
i
would
blackmail
them
i
would
not
hesitate
be
sure
these
words
made
me
slightly
ashamed
of
my
comrades
in
the
hall
but
to
reassure
myself
i
preferred
to
believe
that
the
cook
was
jealous
of
madame
evident
preference
for
me
i
went
every
morning
at
nine
to
open
xavier
curtains
and
carry
him
his
tea
it
is
queer
i
always
entered
his
room
with
my
heart
beating
and
a
strong
feeling
of
apprehension
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
paid
any
attention
to
me
i
turned
this
way
and
that
prepared
his
things
for
him
arranged
his
garments
trying
to
look
pretty
and
show
myself
off
to
advantage
he
spoke
to
me
only
to
complain
in
the
growling
voice
of
one
who
is
half
awake
of
being
disturbed
too
early
i
was
put
out
by
this
indifference
and
i
redoubled
the
silent
tricks
of
coquetry
which
i
had
carefully
planned
i
was
expecting
every
day
something
that
did
not
happen
and
this
silence
on
the
part
of
xavier
this
disdain
for
my
person
irritated
me
to
the
last
degree
what
should
i
have
done
if
that
which
i
expected
had
happened
i
did
not
ask
myself
i
simply
wanted
it
to
happen
xavier
was
really
a
very
pretty
boy
even
prettier
than
his
photograph
a
light
blonde
moustache
two
little
arcs
of
gold
set
off
his
lips
better
than
in
his
portrait
their
red
and
fleshy
pulp
inviting
a
kiss
his
light
blue
eyes
dusted
with
yellow
were
strangely
fascinating
and
his
movements
were
characterized
by
the
indolence
the
weary
and
cruel
grace
of
a
girl
or
young
deer
he
was
tall
slender
very
supple
in
his
elegance
and
wonderfully
seductive
through
his
evident
cynicism
and
corruption
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
he
had
pleased
me
from
the
first
his
resistance
or
rather
his
indifference
caused
my
desire
to
quickly
ripen
into
love
one
morning
i
found
xavier
awake
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
remember
that
he
wore
a
white
silk
shirt
with
blue
dots
i
modestly
started
to
withdraw
but
he
called
me
back
oh
what
is
the
matter
come
in
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
are
you
with
his
two
hands
clasped
over
his
leg
and
his
body
swaying
to
and
fro
he
surveyed
me
for
a
long
time
with
the
utmost
effrontery
while
i
with
slow
and
graceful
movements
and
blushing
a
little
placed
a
tray
on
the
little
table
near
the
mantel
and
as
if
he
then
really
saw
me
for
the
first
time
he
said
why
you
are
a
very
stylish
girl
how
long
then
have
you
been
here
three
weeks
monsieur
well
that
astonishing
what
is
astonishing
monsieur
that
i
have
never
noticed
that
you
were
so
beautiful
come
here
said
he
i
approached
trembling
a
little
without
a
word
he
took
me
by
the
waist
and
forced
me
to
sit
down
beside
him
oh
monsieur
xavier
i
sighed
struggling
but
not
very
vigorously
stop
i
beg
of
you
if
your
parents
were
to
see
you
but
he
began
to
laugh
my
parents
oh
my
parents
you
know
i
have
supped
on
them
this
was
a
phrase
that
he
was
continually
using
when
one
asked
him
anything
he
answered
i
have
supped
on
that
and
he
had
supped
on
everything
to
gain
a
little
time
i
asked
him
there
is
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
monsieur
xavier
how
does
it
happen
that
one
never
sees
you
at
madame
dinners
you
certainly
do
expect
me
my
dear
oh
no
you
know
dinners
tire
me
too
much
and
how
is
it
i
insisted
that
your
room
is
the
only
one
in
the
house
in
which
there
is
not
a
picture
of
the
pope
this
observation
flattered
him
he
answered
why
my
little
baby
i
am
an
anarchist
i
am
religion
the
jesuits
the
priests
oh
no
i
have
enough
of
them
i
have
supped
on
them
a
society
made
up
of
people
like
papa
and
mamma
oh
you
know
none
of
that
in
mine
thank
you
now
i
felt
at
ease
with
xavier
in
whom
i
found
together
with
the
same
vices
the
drawling
accent
of
the
paris
toughs
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
known
him
for
years
and
years
in
his
turn
he
asked
me
tell
me
are
you
intimate
with
papa
your
father
i
cried
pretending
to
be
scandalized
oh
monsieur
xavier
such
a
holy
man
his
laugh
redoubled
and
rang
out
loudly
papa
oh
papa
why
he
is
intimate
with
all
the
servants
here
then
you
are
not
yet
intimate
with
papa
you
astonish
me
oh
no
i
replied
laughing
also
only
he
brings
me
the
de
siècle
the
the
femmes
de
paris
that
set
him
off
in
a
delirium
of
joy
and
shaking
more
than
ever
with
laughter
he
cried
papa
oh
he
is
astonishing
and
being
now
well
started
he
continued
in
a
comical
tone
he
is
like
mamma
yesterday
she
made
me
another
scene
i
am
disgracing
her
her
and
papa
would
you
believe
it
and
religion
and
society
and
everything
it
is
twisting
then
i
declared
to
her
dear
little
mother
it
is
agreed
i
will
settle
down
to
a
regular
life
on
the
day
when
you
shall
have
given
up
your
lovers
that
was
a
hot
one
eh
that
shut
her
up
oh
no
you
know
they
make
me
very
tired
these
authors
of
my
being
i
have
supped
on
their
lectures
by
the
way
you
know
fumeau
do
you
no
monsieur
xavier
why
yes
why
yes
anthime
fumeau
i
assure
you
that
i
do
not
a
fat
fellow
very
young
very
the
finest
teams
in
paris
fumeau
an
income
of
three
millions
tartlet
the
kid
why
yes
you
know
him
but
i
tell
you
that
i
do
not
know
him
you
astonish
me
why
everybody
knows
him
do
you
know
the
fumeau
biscuit
the
young
fellow
who
had
a
judicial
adviser
appointed
for
him
two
months
ago
do
you
remember
not
at
all
i
swear
to
you
monsieur
xavier
never
mind
little
turkey
well
i
played
a
good
one
on
fumeau
last
year
a
very
good
one
guess
what
you
do
not
guess
how
do
you
expect
me
to
guess
since
i
do
not
know
him
well
it
was
this
my
little
baby
i
introduced
fumeau
to
my
mother
upon
my
word
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
discovery
and
the
funniest
part
of
it
is
that
in
two
months
mamma
succeeded
in
blackmailing
fumeau
to
the
tune
of
three
hundred
thousand
bones
what
a
godsend
that
for
papa
works
oh
they
know
a
thing
or
two
they
are
up
to
snuff
but
for
that
the
house
would
have
gone
up
we
were
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
the
priests
themselves
were
refusing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
us
what
do
you
say
to
that
eh
i
say
monsieur
xavier
that
you
have
a
queer
way
of
treating
the
family
what
do
you
expect
my
dear
i
am
an
anarchist
i
am
i
have
supped
on
the
family
that
morning
madame
was
even
nicer
than
usual
with
me
i
am
well
satisfied
with
your
service
she
said
to
me
mary
i
raise
your
wages
ten
francs
if
she
raises
me
ten
francs
every
time
thought
i
to
myself
that
will
not
be
bad
it
is
more
suitable
oh
when
i
think
of
all
that
i
too
have
supped
on
it
xavier
fancy
did
not
last
long
he
had
quickly
supped
on
me
not
for
a
moment
moreover
was
i
able
to
keep
him
in
the
house
several
times
on
entering
his
room
in
the
morning
i
found
the
bed
undisturbed
and
empty
xavier
had
been
out
all
night
the
cook
knew
him
well
and
she
had
told
the
truth
when
she
said
he
prefers
to
roam
elsewhere
he
pursued
his
old
habits
and
went
in
search
of
his
customary
pleasures
as
before
on
those
mornings
i
felt
a
sudden
pain
in
my
heart
and
all
day
long
i
was
sad
sad
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
all
is
that
xavier
had
no
feeling
he
was
not
poetical
like
georges
he
did
not
vouchsafe
me
the
slightest
attention
never
did
he
say
to
me
a
kind
and
touching
word
as
lovers
do
in
books
and
plays
moreover
he
liked
nothing
that
i
liked
he
did
not
like
flowers
with
the
exception
of
the
big
carnations
with
which
he
adorned
the
buttonhole
of
his
coat
yet
it
is
so
good
to
whisper
to
each
other
things
that
caress
the
heart
to
exchange
disinterested
kisses
to
gaze
for
eternities
into
one
another
eyes
but
men
are
such
coarse
creatures
they
do
not
feel
these
joys
these
joys
so
pure
and
blue
and
it
is
a
great
pity
xavier
knew
nothing
but
vice
found
pleasure
only
in
debauchery
in
love
all
that
was
not
vice
and
debauchery
bored
him
oh
no
you
know
that
makes
me
very
tired
i
have
supped
on
poetry
the
little
blue
flower
we
must
leave
that
to
papa
to
him
i
was
always
an
impersonal
creature
the
domestic
to
whom
he
gave
orders
and
whom
he
maltreated
in
the
exercise
of
his
authority
as
master
and
with
his
boyish
cynical
jests
and
he
often
said
to
me
with
a
laugh
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
a
frightful
laugh
that
wounded
and
humiliated
me
and
papa
really
you
are
not
yet
intimate
with
papa
you
astonish
me
once
i
had
not
the
power
to
keep
back
my
tears
they
were
choking
me
xavier
became
angry
at
once
oh
no
you
know
that
is
the
most
tiresome
thing
of
all
tears
scenes
you
must
stop
that
my
dear
or
else
good
evening
i
have
supped
on
all
that
nonsense
for
my
part
i
feel
an
immense
and
imperative
need
of
that
pure
embrace
of
that
chaste
kiss
which
is
no
longer
the
savage
bite
of
the
flesh
but
the
ideal
caress
of
the
soul
i
need
to
rise
from
the
hell
of
love
to
the
paradise
of
ecstasy
to
the
fullness
the
delicious
and
candid
silence
of
ecstasy
but
xavier
had
supped
on
ecstasy
nothing
pained
me
so
much
as
to
see
that
i
had
not
left
the
slightest
trace
of
affection
not
the
smallest
tenderness
in
his
heart
yet
i
believe
that
i
could
have
loved
the
little
scoundrel
that
i
could
have
devoted
myself
to
him
in
spite
of
everything
like
a
beast
even
i
think
regretfully
of
his
impudent
cruel
and
pretty
phiz
and
of
his
perfumed
skin
and
i
have
often
on
my
lips
from
which
since
then
so
many
lips
ought
to
have
effaced
it
the
acid
taste
the
burning
sensation
of
his
kiss
oh
monsieur
xavier
monsieur
xavier
one
evening
before
dinner
when
he
had
returned
to
dress
my
but
how
nice
he
looked
in
evening
dress
and
as
i
was
carefully
arranging
his
affairs
in
the
he
asked
me
without
embarrassment
or
hesitation
and
almost
in
a
tone
of
command
precisely
as
he
would
have
asked
me
for
hot
water
have
you
five
louis
i
am
in
absolute
need
of
five
louis
i
will
return
them
to
you
that
very
morning
madame
had
paid
me
my
wages
did
he
know
it
i
have
only
ninety
francs
i
answered
a
little
ashamed
ashamed
of
his
question
perhaps
but
more
ashamed
i
think
at
not
having
the
entire
sum
that
he
asked
that
makes
no
difference
said
he
go
and
get
me
the
ninety
francs
i
will
return
them
to
you
he
took
the
money
and
by
way
of
thanks
said
in
a
dry
curt
tone
that
froze
my
heart
that
good
then
putting
out
his
foot
with
a
brutal
movement
he
commanded
insolently
tie
my
shoes
and
be
quick
about
it
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
looked
at
him
sadly
imploringly
then
you
are
not
to
dine
here
this
evening
monsieur
xavier
no
i
dine
in
town
make
haste
as
i
tied
his
shoes
i
moaned
and
you
will
not
return
i
shall
cry
all
night
long
it
is
not
nice
of
you
monsieur
xavier
his
voice
became
hard
and
thoroughly
wicked
if
you
lent
me
your
ninety
francs
that
you
might
say
that
you
can
take
them
back
here
take
them
no
no
i
sighed
you
know
very
well
that
it
was
not
for
that
well
then
do
bother
me
he
had
quickly
finished
dressing
and
he
started
off
without
kissing
me
and
without
saying
a
word
the
next
day
nothing
was
said
about
returning
the
money
and
i
did
not
wish
to
claim
it
it
gave
me
pleasure
to
think
that
he
had
something
of
me
and
now
i
understand
the
women
who
kill
themselves
with
toil
the
women
who
sell
themselves
to
at
night
on
the
sidewalks
the
women
who
steal
and
the
women
who
kill
in
order
to
get
a
little
money
with
which
to
procure
indulgences
for
the
little
man
whom
they
love
that
is
what
has
happened
to
me
in
fact
or
has
it
really
happened
to
me
in
the
degree
that
i
say
alas
i
do
not
know
there
are
moments
when
in
presence
of
a
man
i
feel
so
soft
so
soft
without
will
without
courage
so
yielding
yes
so
yielding
madame
was
not
slow
in
changing
her
manner
toward
me
instead
of
treating
me
nicely
as
she
had
done
before
she
became
severe
exacting
i
was
only
a
blockhead
i
never
did
anything
right
i
was
awkward
unclean
forgetful
dishonest
and
her
voice
which
at
first
had
been
so
sweet
so
much
like
the
voice
of
a
comrade
now
became
as
sour
as
vinegar
she
gave
me
orders
in
a
blunt
and
humiliating
tone
no
more
gifts
of
underwear
no
more
cold
cream
and
powder
no
more
of
the
secret
counsels
and
private
confidences
that
had
so
embarrassed
me
at
first
no
more
of
that
suspicious
comradeship
which
at
bottom
i
felt
not
to
be
kindness
and
which
caused
me
to
lose
my
respect
for
this
mistress
who
raised
me
to
the
level
of
her
own
vice
i
snapped
at
her
sharply
strong
in
my
knowledge
of
all
the
open
or
hidden
infamies
of
the
house
we
got
to
quarreling
like
hurling
our
week
notice
at
each
other
heads
like
dirty
rags
what
then
do
you
take
my
house
for
she
cried
do
you
think
you
are
working
for
a
fast
woman
think
of
her
cheek
i
answered
oh
your
house
is
a
clean
one
indeed
you
can
boast
of
it
and
you
let
us
talk
about
it
yes
let
us
talk
about
it
you
are
clean
too
and
what
about
monsieur
oh
la
la
and
do
you
think
they
know
you
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
paris
why
you
are
notorious
everywhere
your
house
a
brothel
and
in
fact
there
are
brothels
which
are
not
as
dirty
as
your
house
and
so
these
quarrels
went
on
we
exchanged
the
worst
insults
and
the
lowest
threats
we
descended
to
the
vocabulary
of
the
and
the
prisons
and
then
suddenly
everything
quieted
down
xavier
had
only
to
show
signs
of
a
reviving
interest
in
me
fleeting
alas
when
straightway
began
again
the
suspicious
familiarity
the
shameful
complicities
the
gifts
of
garments
the
promises
of
doubled
wages
the
washing
with
simon
cream
it
is
more
suitable
and
the
initiations
into
the
mysteries
of
refined
perfumes
conduct
toward
me
was
the
thermometer
by
which
madame
regulated
her
own
the
latter
kindness
immediately
followed
the
former
caresses
abandonment
by
the
son
was
accompanied
by
insults
from
the
mother
i
was
the
victim
continually
tossed
back
and
forth
of
the
enervating
fluctuations
to
which
the
intermittent
love
of
this
capricious
and
heartless
boy
was
subject
one
would
have
thought
that
madame
must
have
played
the
spy
with
us
must
have
listened
at
the
door
must
have
kept
tabs
for
herself
on
the
different
phases
of
our
relations
but
no
she
simply
had
the
instinct
of
vice
that
all
she
scented
it
through
walls
and
souls
as
a
dog
inhales
in
the
breeze
the
odor
of
game
as
for
monsieur
he
continued
to
dance
about
among
all
these
events
among
all
the
hidden
dramas
of
this
house
alert
busy
cynical
and
comical
in
the
morning
he
disappeared
with
his
face
of
a
little
pink
and
shaven
faun
with
his
documents
with
his
bag
stuffed
with
pious
pamphlets
and
obscene
newspapers
in
the
evening
he
reappeared
cravated
with
respectability
armored
with
christian
socialism
his
gait
a
little
slower
his
gestures
a
little
more
oily
his
back
slightly
bent
doubtless
under
the
weight
of
the
good
works
done
during
the
day
regularly
every
friday
he
gave
me
the
week
issues
of
indecent
journals
awaiting
just
the
right
occasion
for
making
his
declaration
and
contenting
himself
with
smiling
at
me
with
the
air
of
an
accomplice
caressing
my
chin
and
saying
to
me
as
he
passed
his
tongue
over
his
lips
ho
ho
she
is
a
very
queer
little
one
indeed
as
it
amused
me
to
watch
monsieur
game
i
did
not
discourage
him
but
i
promised
myself
to
seize
the
first
exceptionally
favorable
opportunity
to
sharply
put
him
where
he
belonged
one
afternoon
i
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
him
enter
the
where
i
sat
alone
musing
sadly
over
my
work
in
the
morning
i
had
had
a
painful
scene
with
xavier
and
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
impression
it
had
left
on
me
monsieur
closed
the
door
softly
placed
his
bag
on
the
large
table
near
a
pile
of
cloth
and
coming
to
me
took
my
hands
and
patted
them
under
his
blinking
eyelid
his
eye
turned
like
that
of
an
old
hen
dazzled
by
the
sunlight
it
was
enough
to
make
one
die
of
laughter
célestine
said
he
for
my
part
i
prefer
to
call
you
célestine
that
does
not
offend
you
does
it
i
could
hardly
keep
from
bursting
why
no
monsieur
i
answered
holding
myself
on
the
defensive
well
célestine
i
think
you
charming
there
really
monsieur
adorable
in
fact
adorable
adorable
oh
monsieur
his
fingers
had
left
my
hand
and
were
caressing
my
neck
and
chin
with
fat
and
soft
little
touches
adorable
adorable
he
whispered
he
tried
to
embrace
me
i
drew
back
a
little
to
avoid
his
kiss
stay
célestine
i
beg
of
you
i
do
not
annoy
you
do
i
no
monsieur
you
astonish
me
i
astonish
you
you
little
rogue
i
astonish
you
oh
you
do
know
me
his
voice
was
no
longer
dry
a
fine
froth
moistened
his
lips
listen
to
me
célestine
next
week
i
am
going
to
lourdes
yes
i
conduct
a
pilgrimage
to
lourdes
do
you
wish
to
come
to
lourdes
i
have
a
way
of
taking
you
to
lourdes
will
you
come
nobody
will
notice
anything
you
will
stay
at
the
hotel
you
will
take
walks
or
do
what
you
like
and
i
will
meet
you
in
the
evening
what
stupefied
me
was
not
the
proposition
in
itself
for
i
had
been
expecting
it
a
long
time
but
the
unforeseen
form
which
monsieur
gave
it
yet
i
preserved
all
my
and
desirous
of
humiliating
this
old
rake
of
showing
him
that
i
had
not
been
the
dupe
of
madame
dirty
calculations
and
his
own
i
lashed
him
squarely
in
the
face
with
these
words
and
xavier
say
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
forgetting
xavier
what
is
he
to
do
while
we
are
amusing
ourselves
in
lourdes
at
the
expense
of
christianity
an
indirect
and
troubled
gleam
the
look
of
a
surprised
deer
lighted
in
the
darkness
of
his
eyes
he
stammered
m
xavier
why
yes
why
do
you
speak
to
me
of
xavier
there
is
no
question
of
xavier
xavier
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
redoubled
my
insolence
on
your
word
oh
do
pretend
to
be
ignorant
am
i
hired
yes
or
no
to
be
company
for
xavier
yes
am
i
not
well
i
am
company
for
him
but
you
oh
no
that
is
not
in
the
bargain
and
then
you
know
my
little
father
you
are
not
my
style
and
i
burst
out
laughing
in
his
face
he
turned
purple
his
eyes
flamed
with
anger
but
he
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
enter
into
a
discussion
for
which
i
was
terribly
armed
he
hastily
picked
up
his
bag
and
slunk
away
pursued
by
my
laughter
the
next
day
apropos
of
nothing
monsieur
made
some
gross
remark
to
me
i
flew
into
a
passion
madame
happened
along
i
became
mad
with
anger
the
scene
that
ensued
between
us
three
was
so
frightful
so
low
that
i
can
not
undertake
to
describe
it
in
unspeakable
terms
i
reproached
them
with
all
their
filth
and
with
all
their
infamy
i
demanded
the
return
of
the
money
that
i
had
lent
xavier
they
foamed
at
the
mouth
i
seized
a
cushion
and
hurled
it
violently
at
head
go
away
get
out
of
here
at
once
at
once
screamed
madame
threatening
to
tear
my
face
with
her
nails
i
erase
your
name
from
the
membership
of
my
society
you
no
longer
belong
to
my
society
lost
creature
prostitute
vociferated
monsieur
stuffing
his
bag
with
thrusts
of
his
fists
finally
madame
withheld
my
week
wages
refused
to
pay
the
ninety
francs
that
i
had
lent
xavier
and
obliged
me
to
return
all
the
rags
that
she
had
given
me
you
are
all
thieves
i
cried
you
are
all
pimps
and
i
went
away
threatening
them
with
the
commissary
of
police
and
the
justice
of
the
peace
oh
you
are
looking
for
trouble
yes
well
you
shall
have
it
scoundrels
that
you
are
alas
the
commissary
of
police
pretended
that
the
affair
did
not
concern
him
the
justice
of
the
peace
advised
me
to
let
it
drop
he
explained
in
the
first
place
mademoiselle
you
will
not
be
believed
and
that
is
as
it
should
be
what
would
become
of
society
if
a
servant
could
be
right
against
a
master
there
would
be
no
more
society
mademoiselle
that
would
be
anarchy
i
consulted
a
lawyer
he
demanded
two
hundred
francs
i
wrote
to
xavier
he
did
not
answer
me
then
i
counted
up
my
resources
i
had
three
francs
fifty
left
and
the
street
pavement
xiii
and
i
see
myself
again
at
neuilly
with
the
sisters
of
our
lady
of
sorrows
a
sort
of
house
of
refuge
and
also
an
for
housemaids
my
but
it
is
a
fine
establishment
with
a
white
front
and
at
the
rear
of
a
large
garden
in
the
garden
which
is
ornamented
at
intervals
of
fifty
steps
with
statues
of
the
virgin
there
is
a
little
chapel
very
new
and
sumptuous
built
from
the
proceeds
of
the
collections
large
trees
surround
it
and
every
hour
one
hears
the
tolling
of
the
bells
it
is
so
nice
to
hear
the
bells
toll
it
stirs
in
one
heart
memories
of
things
so
old
and
long
forgotten
when
the
bells
toll
i
close
my
eyes
and
listen
and
i
see
again
landscapes
which
perhaps
i
never
saw
before
and
which
i
recognize
all
the
same
very
peaceful
landscapes
imbued
with
all
the
transformed
recollections
of
childhood
and
youth
and
bagpipes
and
on
the
moor
bordering
on
the
beaches
the
panorama
of
holiday
crowds
ding
dinn
dong
it
is
not
very
gay
it
is
not
the
same
thing
as
gaiety
it
is
even
sad
at
bottom
sad
like
love
but
i
like
it
in
paris
one
never
hears
anything
but
the
fountaineer
horn
and
the
deafening
trumpet
of
the
tramway
in
the
establishment
of
the
sisters
of
our
lady
of
sorrows
you
sleep
in
attic
dormitories
you
are
fed
meagrely
on
scraps
of
meat
and
spoiled
vegetables
and
you
pay
sous
a
day
to
the
institution
that
is
to
say
the
sisters
withhold
sous
from
your
wages
when
they
have
secured
a
place
for
you
they
call
that
getting
you
a
place
for
nothing
further
you
have
to
work
from
six
in
the
morning
until
nine
in
the
evening
like
the
inmates
of
prisons
you
are
not
allowed
to
go
out
meals
and
religious
exercises
take
the
place
of
recreation
ah
the
good
sisters
do
not
bore
themselves
as
xavier
would
say
and
their
charity
is
a
famous
trap
they
rope
you
in
finely
but
there
it
is
i
shall
be
stupid
all
my
life
the
stern
lessons
of
experience
the
succession
of
misfortunes
never
teach
me
anything
are
of
no
use
to
me
i
am
always
crying
out
and
raising
a
row
but
in
the
end
i
am
always
victimized
by
everybody
several
times
comrades
had
spoken
to
me
of
the
sisters
of
our
lady
of
sorrows
yes
my
dear
it
seems
that
only
very
swell
people
come
to
the
box
countesses
marchionesses
one
may
chance
on
astonishing
places
i
believed
it
and
then
in
my
distress
i
remembered
with
some
feeling
booby
that
i
am
the
happy
years
that
i
spent
with
the
little
sisters
of
moreover
i
had
to
go
somewhere
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
when
i
arrived
there
were
forty
housemaids
there
many
came
from
a
great
distance
from
brittany
from
alsace
from
the
south
girls
who
had
never
yet
had
a
place
awkward
clumsy
with
livid
complexions
sly
airs
and
singular
eyes
that
looked
over
the
walls
of
the
convent
at
the
mirage
of
paris
lying
beyond
others
not
as
green
were
just
out
of
a
place
like
myself
the
sisters
asked
me
whence
i
came
what
i
knew
how
to
do
whether
i
had
good
references
and
whether
i
had
any
money
left
i
told
them
all
sorts
of
things
and
without
further
inquiry
they
welcomed
me
saying
this
dear
child
we
will
find
her
a
good
place
we
all
were
their
dear
children
while
waiting
for
the
promised
good
place
each
of
these
dear
children
was
put
at
some
work
according
to
her
faculties
some
did
cooking
and
housework
others
worked
in
the
garden
digging
in
the
soil
like
navvies
i
was
promptly
put
at
sewing
having
said
sister
boniface
supple
fingers
and
a
distinguished
air
i
began
by
mending
the
chaplain
pantaloons
and
the
drawers
of
a
sort
of
monk
who
was
just
then
preaching
a
retreat
in
the
chapel
oh
those
pantaloons
oh
those
drawers
surely
they
did
not
resemble
xavier
then
they
intrusted
to
me
tasks
less
ecclesiastical
quite
profane
in
fact
the
making
of
fine
and
delicate
linen
garments
among
which
i
again
found
myself
in
my
element
i
participated
in
the
making
of
elegant
bridal
of
rich
ordered
of
the
good
sisters
by
charitable
and
wealthy
ladies
who
were
interested
in
the
establishment
at
first
after
so
many
shocks
in
spite
of
the
bad
food
the
chaplain
pantaloons
the
lack
of
liberty
in
spite
of
all
the
fierce
exploitation
that
i
could
plainly
see
i
felt
a
sense
of
real
relief
amid
this
calm
and
silence
i
did
not
reason
much
i
felt
rather
a
need
of
prayer
remorse
over
my
past
conduct
or
rather
the
weariness
resulting
from
it
prompted
me
to
fervent
repentance
several
times
in
succession
i
confessed
to
the
chaplain
he
was
a
queer
man
this
chaplain
very
round
and
red
a
little
rude
in
manner
and
in
speech
and
afflicted
with
a
disagreeable
he
asked
me
strange
questions
and
insisted
on
knowing
my
favorite
authors
armand
silvestre
yes
to
be
sure
he
is
dirty
i
would
not
give
you
his
works
instead
of
the
no
not
that
yet
he
is
not
dangerous
but
you
must
not
read
impious
books
books
against
religion
voltaire
for
instance
no
never
never
read
voltaire
that
is
a
mortal
sin
or
renan
or
anatole
france
they
are
dangerous
and
paul
bourget
father
paul
bourget
he
is
entering
on
the
right
path
that
i
do
not
deny
but
his
catholicism
is
not
sincere
not
yet
at
least
it
is
much
mixed
your
paul
bourget
makes
upon
me
the
impression
of
a
yes
that
is
it
of
a
in
which
no
matter
what
has
been
washed
and
in
which
olives
from
calvary
are
swimming
amid
hair
and
soapsuds
you
should
wait
a
little
before
reading
him
huysmans
well
he
is
a
little
stiff
in
his
expressions
yes
indeed
very
stiff
but
he
is
orthodox
and
he
said
to
me
further
yes
ah
you
do
mad
things
with
your
body
that
is
not
good
no
indeed
that
is
always
bad
but
sin
for
sin
it
is
better
to
sin
with
your
masters
when
they
are
pious
persons
than
with
people
of
your
own
condition
it
is
less
serious
less
irritating
to
the
good
god
and
perhaps
these
people
have
dispensations
many
have
dispensations
as
i
named
xavier
and
his
father
he
cried
no
names
i
do
not
ask
you
for
names
never
tell
me
names
i
do
not
belong
to
the
police
besides
those
are
rich
and
respectable
people
whom
you
have
just
named
extremely
religious
people
consequently
you
are
wrong
you
are
rebellious
against
morality
and
against
society
these
ridiculous
conversations
considerably
cooled
my
religious
zeal
my
ardor
for
repentance
the
work
too
annoyed
me
it
made
me
homesick
for
my
own
calling
i
felt
impatient
desires
to
escape
from
this
prison
to
return
to
the
privacies
of
i
sighed
for
the
closets
full
of
linen
the
wardrobes
stuffed
with
silks
satins
and
velvets
so
smooth
to
the
touch
and
the
where
white
flesh
is
lathered
with
oily
soaps
and
the
stories
of
the
servants
hall
and
the
unforeseen
adventures
and
the
evenings
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
chambers
it
is
really
curious
when
i
have
a
place
these
things
disgust
me
but
when
i
am
out
of
a
place
i
miss
them
i
was
tired
also
excessively
tired
sickened
in
fact
from
having
eaten
for
a
week
nothing
but
preserves
made
out
of
spoiled
currants
of
which
the
good
sisters
had
purchased
a
large
quantity
in
the
levallois
market
anything
that
the
holy
women
could
rescue
from
the
was
good
enough
for
us
what
completed
my
irritation
was
the
evident
the
persistent
effrontery
with
which
we
were
exploited
their
game
was
a
very
simple
one
and
they
took
little
pains
to
conceal
it
they
found
places
only
for
those
girls
of
whom
they
could
make
no
use
themselves
those
from
whom
they
could
reap
any
profit
whatever
they
held
as
prisoners
taking
advantage
of
their
talents
of
their
strength
and
of
their
simplicity
as
the
height
of
christian
charity
they
had
found
a
way
of
having
servants
who
paid
for
the
privilege
of
working
and
whom
they
stripped
without
remorse
and
with
inconceivable
cynicism
of
their
modest
resources
and
their
little
savings
after
making
a
profit
out
of
their
labor
and
the
costs
kept
running
on
i
complained
at
first
feebly
and
then
more
forcibly
that
they
had
not
once
summoned
me
into
the
but
to
all
my
complaints
the
hypocrites
answered
a
little
patience
my
dear
child
we
are
planning
to
get
you
an
excellent
place
my
dear
child
for
you
we
desire
an
exceptional
place
we
know
what
sort
of
a
place
you
should
have
as
yet
not
one
has
offered
itself
such
as
we
wish
for
you
and
such
as
you
deserve
days
and
weeks
passed
the
places
were
never
good
enough
never
exceptional
enough
for
me
and
the
costs
kept
running
on
although
there
was
a
watcher
in
the
dormitory
the
things
that
went
on
every
night
were
enough
to
make
one
shudder
as
soon
as
the
watcher
had
finished
her
round
and
every
one
seemed
to
be
asleep
you
could
see
white
forms
arise
and
glide
about
among
the
beds
the
good
sisters
holy
women
closed
their
eyes
that
they
might
see
nothing
stopped
up
their
ears
that
they
might
hear
nothing
wishing
to
avoid
scandal
they
tolerated
horrors
of
which
they
feigned
ignorance
and
the
costs
kept
running
on
fortunately
when
i
was
at
the
very
depth
of
my
ennui
i
was
delighted
by
the
entrance
into
the
establishment
of
a
little
friend
clémence
whom
i
called
cléclé
and
whom
i
had
known
in
a
place
where
i
had
worked
in
the
rue
de
cléclé
was
a
charming
pink
blonde
extremely
gay
and
lively
and
very
fly
she
laughed
at
everything
accepted
everything
and
was
contented
everywhere
devoted
and
faithful
she
knew
but
one
pleasure
that
of
being
useful
to
others
vicious
to
the
marrow
of
her
bones
her
vice
had
nothing
repugnant
about
it
it
was
so
gay
artless
and
natural
she
bore
vice
as
a
plant
bears
flowers
as
a
bears
cherries
her
pretty
chatter
sometimes
made
me
forget
my
feeling
of
weariness
and
put
to
sleep
my
tendency
to
rebel
our
two
beds
were
next
to
each
other
and
one
night
she
told
me
in
a
funny
sort
of
whisper
that
she
had
just
had
a
place
in
the
house
of
a
magistrate
at
versailles
fancy
there
were
nothing
but
animals
in
the
den
cats
three
parrots
a
monkey
and
two
dogs
and
they
all
had
to
be
taken
care
of
nothing
was
good
enough
for
them
we
were
fed
on
old
scraps
the
same
as
in
this
box
here
but
they
had
what
was
left
over
of
the
poultry
they
had
cream
and
cakes
and
mineral
water
my
dear
yes
the
dirty
beasts
drank
nothing
but
evian
water
because
of
an
epidemic
of
typhoid
fever
that
was
raging
at
versailles
in
the
winter
madame
had
the
cheek
to
take
the
stove
out
of
my
chamber
and
put
it
in
the
room
where
the
monkey
and
the
cats
slept
would
you
believe
it
i
detested
them
especially
one
of
the
dogs
a
horrible
old
pug
that
was
always
sniffing
at
my
skirts
in
spite
of
the
kicks
that
i
gave
it
the
other
morning
madame
caught
me
whipping
it
you
can
imagine
the
scene
she
showed
me
the
door
in
time
oh
this
cléclé
how
agreeable
and
amusing
she
was
people
have
no
idea
of
all
the
annoyances
to
which
domestics
are
subjected
or
of
the
fierce
and
eternal
exploitation
under
which
they
suffer
now
the
masters
now
the
keepers
of
now
the
charitable
institutions
to
say
nothing
of
the
comrades
some
of
whom
are
capable
of
terrible
meanness
and
nobody
takes
any
interest
in
anybody
else
each
one
lives
grows
fat
and
is
entertained
by
the
misery
of
some
one
poorer
than
himself
scenes
change
settings
are
shifted
you
traverse
social
surroundings
that
are
different
and
even
hostile
but
everywhere
you
find
the
same
appetites
and
passions
in
the
cramped
apartments
of
the
and
in
the
elegant
mansion
of
the
banker
you
meet
the
same
filth
and
come
in
contact
with
the
inexorable
the
result
of
it
all
for
a
girl
like
me
is
that
she
is
conquered
in
advance
wherever
she
may
go
and
whatever
she
may
do
the
poor
are
the
human
manure
in
which
grow
the
harvests
of
life
the
harvests
of
joy
which
the
rich
reap
and
which
they
misuse
so
cruelly
against
us
they
pretend
that
there
is
no
more
slavery
oh
what
nonsense
and
what
are
domestics
then
if
not
slaves
slaves
in
fact
with
all
that
slavery
involves
of
moral
vileness
inevitable
corruption
and
rebellion
servants
learn
vice
in
the
houses
of
their
masters
entering
upon
their
duties
pure
and
innocent
some
of
them
they
are
quickly
made
rotten
by
contact
with
habits
of
depravity
they
see
nothing
but
vice
they
breathe
nothing
but
vice
they
touch
nothing
but
vice
consequently
from
day
to
day
from
minute
to
minute
they
get
more
and
more
used
to
it
being
defenceless
against
it
being
obliged
on
the
contrary
to
serve
it
to
care
for
it
to
respect
it
and
their
revolt
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
are
powerless
to
satisfy
it
and
to
break
down
all
the
obstacles
in
the
way
of
its
natural
expansion
oh
it
is
extraordinary
they
demand
of
us
all
the
virtues
complete
resignation
all
the
sacrifices
all
the
heroisms
and
only
those
vices
that
flatter
the
vanity
of
the
masters
and
which
yield
them
a
profit
and
all
this
in
return
for
contempt
and
wages
ranging
from
to
ninety
francs
a
month
no
it
is
too
much
add
that
we
live
in
perpetual
distress
of
mind
in
a
perpetual
struggle
between
the
ephemeral
of
the
places
that
we
fill
and
the
anguish
which
the
loss
of
these
places
causes
us
add
that
we
are
continually
conscious
of
the
wounding
suspicions
that
follow
us
everywhere
bolting
doors
padlocking
drawers
marking
bottles
numbering
cakes
and
prunes
and
continually
putting
us
to
shame
by
invasive
examination
of
our
hands
our
pockets
and
our
trunks
for
there
is
not
a
door
not
a
closet
not
a
drawer
not
a
bottle
not
an
article
that
does
not
cry
out
to
us
thief
thief
thief
and
also
the
continuous
vexation
caused
by
that
terrible
inequality
that
frightful
disproportion
in
our
destinies
which
in
spite
of
familiarities
smiles
and
presents
places
between
our
mistresses
and
ourselves
an
impassable
abyss
a
whole
world
of
sullen
hatreds
suppressed
desires
and
future
vengeances
a
disproportion
which
is
rendered
every
minute
more
perceptible
more
humiliating
more
disgracing
by
the
caprices
and
even
by
the
kindnesses
of
those
beings
that
know
no
justice
and
feel
no
love
the
rich
did
you
ever
think
for
a
moment
of
the
mortal
and
legitimate
hatred
of
the
murderous
yes
murderous
desires
with
which
we
must
be
filled
when
we
hear
one
of
our
masters
in
trying
to
describe
something
base
and
ignoble
cry
out
in
our
presence
with
a
disgust
that
casts
us
so
violently
outside
the
pale
of
humanity
he
has
the
soul
of
a
domestic
that
is
the
sentiment
of
a
domestic
then
what
do
you
expect
us
to
become
in
these
hells
do
these
mistresses
really
imagine
that
i
should
not
like
to
wear
fine
dresses
ride
in
fine
carriages
have
a
gay
time
with
lovers
and
have
servants
of
my
own
they
talk
to
us
of
devotion
of
honesty
of
fidelity
why
but
it
would
choke
you
to
death
my
little
chippies
once
in
the
rue
cambon
how
many
of
these
places
i
have
had
the
masters
were
marrying
their
daughter
they
gave
a
grand
reception
in
the
evening
at
which
the
were
exhibited
enough
of
them
to
fill
a
by
way
of
jest
i
asked
baptiste
the
de
chambre
well
baptiste
and
you
what
is
your
present
my
present
exclaimed
baptiste
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
yes
tell
me
what
is
it
a
can
of
petroleum
lighted
under
their
bed
that
is
my
present
it
was
a
smart
answer
moreover
this
baptiste
was
an
astonishing
man
in
politics
and
yours
célestine
he
asked
in
his
turn
mine
i
contracted
my
two
hands
into
the
shape
of
talons
and
pretending
to
claw
a
face
ferociously
i
answered
my
nails
in
their
eyes
the
butler
without
being
asked
remarked
quietly
while
arranging
flowers
and
fruits
in
a
glass
dish
with
his
fastidious
fingers
i
would
be
satisfied
to
sprinkle
their
faces
in
church
with
a
bottle
of
good
vitriol
and
he
stuck
a
rose
between
two
pears
oh
yes
how
we
love
them
the
extraordinary
thing
is
that
these
revenges
are
not
taken
more
frequently
when
i
think
that
a
cook
for
instance
holds
her
masters
lives
in
her
hands
every
day
a
pinch
of
arsenic
instead
of
salt
a
little
dash
of
strychnine
instead
of
vinegar
and
the
thing
is
done
well
no
it
must
be
that
we
have
servitude
in
our
very
blood
i
have
no
education
and
i
write
what
i
think
and
what
i
have
seen
well
i
say
that
all
this
is
not
beautiful
i
say
that
from
the
moment
when
any
one
installs
another
under
his
roof
though
he
were
the
last
of
poor
devils
or
the
lowest
of
disreputable
girls
he
owes
them
protection
he
owes
them
happiness
i
say
also
that
if
the
master
does
not
give
it
to
us
we
have
a
right
to
take
it
even
from
his
even
from
his
blood
but
enough
of
this
i
do
wrong
to
think
of
things
that
make
my
head
ache
and
turn
my
stomach
i
come
back
to
my
little
stories
i
had
much
difficulty
in
leaving
the
sisters
of
our
lady
of
sorrows
in
spite
of
cléclé
companionship
i
was
growing
old
in
the
box
and
beginning
to
be
hungry
for
liberty
when
they
understood
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
go
then
the
worthy
sisters
offered
me
places
and
places
there
were
places
only
for
me
but
i
am
not
always
a
fool
and
i
have
a
keen
eye
for
rascalities
all
these
places
i
refused
in
all
of
them
i
found
something
that
did
not
suit
me
you
should
have
seen
the
heads
of
these
holy
women
it
was
laughable
they
had
calculated
on
finding
me
a
place
in
the
house
of
some
old
bigot
where
they
could
get
back
out
of
my
wages
the
cost
of
my
board
with
usury
and
i
enjoyed
playing
them
a
trick
in
my
turn
one
day
i
notified
sister
boniface
that
it
was
my
intention
to
go
that
very
evening
she
had
the
cheek
to
answer
me
raising
her
arms
to
heaven
but
my
dear
child
it
is
impossible
how
so
why
is
it
impossible
why
my
dear
child
you
can
not
leave
the
house
like
that
you
owe
us
more
than
seventy
francs
you
will
have
to
pay
us
first
these
seventy
francs
and
with
what
i
replied
i
have
not
a
sou
you
can
search
me
sister
boniface
gave
me
a
hateful
look
and
then
declared
with
severe
dignity
but
mademoiselle
do
you
know
that
this
is
a
robbery
and
to
rob
poor
women
like
us
is
worse
than
robbery
it
is
a
sacrilege
for
which
the
good
god
will
punish
you
reflect
then
anger
got
the
better
of
me
and
i
cried
say
then
who
is
it
that
steals
here
you
or
i
no
but
you
are
astonishing
my
little
mothers
mademoiselle
i
forbid
you
to
speak
in
this
way
oh
do
talk
to
me
what
one
does
your
work
one
toils
like
a
beast
for
you
from
morning
to
night
one
earns
enormous
money
for
you
you
give
us
food
which
dogs
would
refuse
and
then
we
must
pay
you
into
the
bargain
indeed
you
have
no
cheek
sister
boniface
had
turned
very
pale
i
felt
that
coarse
filthy
furious
words
were
on
her
lips
and
ready
to
leave
them
but
not
daring
to
let
them
go
she
stammered
silence
you
are
a
girl
without
shame
without
religion
god
will
punish
you
go
if
you
will
but
we
keep
your
trunk
i
planted
myself
squarely
before
her
in
an
attitude
of
defiance
and
looking
her
full
in
the
face
i
said
well
i
should
like
to
see
you
try
it
just
try
to
keep
my
trunk
and
you
will
have
a
visit
from
the
commissary
of
police
in
short
order
and
if
religion
consists
in
patching
the
dirty
pantaloons
of
your
chaplains
in
stealing
bread
from
poor
girls
in
speculating
on
the
horrors
that
go
on
every
night
in
the
dormitory
the
good
sister
was
fairly
white
she
tried
to
cover
my
voice
with
her
own
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
oh
do
pretend
ignorance
of
the
dirty
things
that
go
on
every
night
in
the
dormitory
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
in
my
face
your
eyes
looking
into
mine
that
you
are
ignorant
of
them
you
encourage
them
because
they
are
profitable
to
you
yes
because
they
are
profitable
to
you
and
trembling
panting
with
dry
throat
i
completed
my
accusation
if
religion
is
all
that
if
it
is
religious
to
keep
a
prison
and
a
brothel
well
then
i
have
enough
of
religion
my
trunk
do
you
hear
i
wish
my
trunk
you
will
give
me
my
trunk
at
once
sister
boniface
was
frightened
i
do
not
wish
to
discuss
with
a
lost
creature
said
she
in
a
voice
of
dignity
all
right
you
shall
go
with
my
trunk
with
your
trunk
very
well
but
it
takes
tall
talk
to
get
one
rights
here
it
is
worse
than
at
the
i
went
in
fact
that
very
evening
cléclé
who
was
very
nice
and
who
had
saved
something
lent
me
twenty
francs
i
went
to
engage
a
room
in
a
in
the
rue
de
la
sourdière
and
i
bought
a
seat
among
the
at
the
the
play
was
the
two
orphans
how
true
it
is
almost
my
own
story
i
passed
there
a
delightful
evening
weeping
weeping
weeping
xiv
rose
is
dead
decidedly
misfortune
hangs
over
the
captain
house
poor
captain
his
ferret
dead
bourbaki
dead
and
now
it
is
rose
turn
after
a
sickness
of
some
days
she
was
carried
off
day
before
yesterday
in
the
evening
by
a
sudden
attack
of
congestion
of
the
lungs
she
was
buried
this
morning
from
the
windows
of
the
i
saw
the
procession
pass
in
the
road
the
heavy
coffin
borne
by
six
men
was
covered
with
crowns
and
with
bunches
of
white
flowers
like
that
of
a
young
virgin
a
considerable
crowd
in
long
dark
babbling
files
all
followed
captain
mauger
who
wearing
a
black
and
holding
himself
very
stiffly
led
the
mourners
in
thoroughly
military
fashion
and
the
church
bells
tolling
in
the
distance
responded
to
the
sound
of
the
rattle
waved
by
the
beadle
madame
had
warned
me
that
i
was
not
to
go
to
the
funeral
however
i
had
no
desire
to
go
i
did
not
like
this
fat
and
wicked
woman
her
death
leaves
me
very
calm
and
indifferent
yet
perhaps
i
shall
miss
rose
perhaps
i
shall
miss
my
occasional
conversations
with
her
in
the
road
but
what
a
source
of
gossip
this
event
must
be
at
the
grocer
i
was
curious
to
know
what
impression
this
sudden
death
had
made
upon
the
captain
and
as
my
masters
were
visiting
i
took
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
along
the
hedge
the
captain
garden
is
sad
and
deserted
a
spade
stuck
in
the
ground
indicates
abandoned
work
the
captain
will
not
come
into
the
garden
said
i
to
myself
he
is
undoubtedly
weeping
in
his
chamber
among
the
souvenirs
and
suddenly
i
perceive
him
he
has
taken
off
his
fine
and
put
on
his
again
and
with
his
old
on
his
head
he
is
engaged
in
manuring
his
lawns
i
even
hear
him
humming
a
march
in
a
low
voice
he
leaves
his
wheelbarrow
and
comes
toward
me
carrying
his
fork
on
his
shoulder
i
am
glad
to
see
you
mademoiselle
célestine
i
should
like
to
offer
him
consolation
or
pity
i
search
for
words
for
phrases
but
how
can
one
find
a
touching
word
in
presence
of
such
a
droll
face
i
content
myself
with
repeating
a
great
misfortune
captain
a
great
misfortune
for
you
poor
rose
yes
yes
he
says
tamely
his
face
is
devoid
of
expression
his
movements
are
uncertain
he
adds
jabbing
his
fork
into
a
soft
spot
in
the
ground
near
the
hedge
especially
as
i
can
not
get
along
without
anybody
i
insist
upon
rose
domestic
virtues
you
will
not
easily
replace
her
captain
decidedly
he
is
not
touched
at
all
one
would
say
even
from
looking
at
his
eyes
that
have
suddenly
become
brighter
and
from
watching
his
movements
now
more
alert
that
he
has
been
relieved
from
a
great
weight
bah
says
he
after
a
short
silence
everything
can
be
replaced
this
resignation
astonishes
me
and
even
scandalizes
me
a
little
to
amuse
myself
i
try
to
make
him
understand
all
he
has
lost
in
losing
rose
she
knew
so
well
your
habits
your
tastes
your
manias
she
was
so
devoted
to
you
well
if
she
had
not
been
that
would
have
been
the
last
straw
he
growled
and
making
a
gesture
by
which
he
seems
to
put
aside
all
sorts
of
objections
he
goes
on
besides
was
she
so
devoted
to
me
oh
i
may
as
well
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
had
enough
of
rose
yes
indeed
after
we
took
a
little
boy
to
help
us
she
attended
to
nothing
in
the
house
and
everything
went
badly
very
badly
i
could
not
even
have
an
egg
boiled
to
my
taste
and
the
scenes
that
went
on
from
morning
to
night
apropos
of
nothing
if
i
spent
ten
sous
there
were
cries
and
reproaches
and
when
i
talked
with
you
as
i
am
doing
now
well
there
was
a
row
indeed
for
she
was
jealous
jealous
oh
no
she
went
for
you
you
should
have
heard
her
in
short
i
was
no
longer
at
home
in
my
own
house
he
breathes
deeply
noisily
and
with
the
new
and
deep
joy
that
a
traveler
feels
on
returning
from
a
long
journey
he
contemplates
the
sky
the
bare
in
the
garden
the
violet
interlacings
of
the
branches
of
the
trees
against
the
light
and
his
little
house
this
joy
so
offensive
to
rose
memory
now
seems
to
me
very
comical
i
stimulate
the
captain
to
further
confidences
and
i
say
to
him
in
a
tone
of
reproach
captain
i
think
you
are
not
just
to
rose
egad
he
rejoins
quickly
you
do
not
know
you
do
know
anything
about
it
she
did
not
go
to
tell
you
of
all
the
scenes
that
she
made
her
tyranny
her
jealousy
her
egoism
nothing
belonged
to
me
here
any
longer
everything
in
my
house
was
hers
for
instance
you
would
not
believe
it
my
voltaire
was
never
at
my
disposition
she
had
it
all
the
time
she
had
everything
for
that
matter
to
think
that
i
could
no
longer
eat
asparagus
with
oil
because
she
did
not
like
it
oh
she
did
well
to
die
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
her
for
in
some
way
or
other
i
should
have
gotten
rid
of
her
yes
yes
i
should
have
gotten
rid
of
her
she
was
becoming
too
much
for
me
i
had
had
enough
and
let
me
tell
you
if
i
had
died
before
her
rose
would
have
been
prettily
trapped
i
had
a
bitter
pill
in
store
for
her
my
word
for
it
his
lip
curls
in
a
smile
that
ends
in
an
atrocious
grimace
he
continues
chopping
each
of
his
words
with
moist
little
puffs
of
laughter
you
know
that
i
made
a
will
in
which
i
gave
her
everything
house
money
dividends
everything
she
must
have
told
you
she
told
everybody
yes
but
what
she
did
not
tell
you
because
she
did
not
know
it
is
that
two
months
later
i
made
a
second
will
cancelling
the
first
in
which
i
did
not
leave
her
anything
not
a
sou
unable
to
contain
himself
longer
he
bursts
out
laughing
a
strident
laugh
that
scatters
through
the
garden
like
a
flight
of
scolding
sparrows
and
he
cries
ah
that
an
idea
hey
oh
her
head
you
can
see
it
from
here
on
learning
that
i
had
left
my
little
fortune
to
the
french
academy
for
my
little
célestine
it
is
true
i
had
left
my
fortune
to
the
french
academy
ah
that
an
idea
i
allow
his
laughter
to
become
quieter
and
then
i
gravely
ask
him
and
now
captain
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
captain
gives
me
a
long
sly
amorous
look
and
says
well
that
depends
on
you
on
me
yes
on
you
on
you
alone
and
how
is
that
a
moment
of
silence
follows
during
which
straightening
up
and
twisting
his
pointed
beard
he
seeks
to
envelop
me
in
a
seductive
fluid
come
he
says
suddenly
let
us
go
straight
to
the
point
let
us
speak
squarely
do
you
wish
to
take
rose
place
i
was
expecting
the
attack
i
had
seen
it
coming
from
the
depth
of
his
eyes
it
does
not
surprise
me
i
receive
it
with
a
serious
and
unmoved
expression
and
the
wills
captain
oh
i
tear
them
up
i
object
but
i
do
not
know
how
to
cook
oh
i
will
do
the
cooking
i
will
make
my
bed
i
will
do
everything
he
becomes
gallant
sprightly
his
eye
sparkles
he
leans
towards
the
hedge
stretching
out
his
neck
his
eyes
become
bloodshot
and
in
a
lower
voice
he
says
if
you
came
to
me
célestine
well
well
what
well
the
lanlaires
would
die
of
rage
ah
that
an
idea
i
lapse
into
silence
and
pretend
to
be
profoundly
dreaming
the
captain
becomes
impatient
he
digs
the
heels
of
his
shoes
into
the
sandy
path
see
célestine
francs
a
month
the
master
table
the
master
room
a
will
does
that
suit
you
answer
me
we
will
see
later
but
while
waiting
take
another
and
i
run
away
that
i
may
not
blow
into
his
face
the
tempest
of
laughter
that
is
roaring
in
my
throat
i
have
then
only
the
embarrassment
of
choice
the
captain
or
joseph
to
live
as
a
with
all
the
contingencies
that
such
a
position
involves
that
is
to
remain
still
at
the
mercy
of
a
stupid
coarse
changeable
man
and
dependent
upon
a
thousand
disagreeable
circumstances
and
a
thousand
prejudices
or
else
to
marry
and
thus
acquire
a
sort
of
regular
and
respected
liberty
in
a
situation
free
from
the
control
of
others
and
liberated
from
the
caprice
of
events
here
at
last
a
portion
of
my
dream
promises
to
be
realized
it
is
very
evident
that
i
should
have
liked
a
realization
on
a
grander
scale
but
when
i
think
how
few
chances
present
themselves
in
general
in
the
existence
of
a
woman
like
me
i
must
congratulate
myself
that
something
is
coming
to
me
at
last
other
than
this
eternal
and
monotonous
tossing
back
and
forth
from
one
house
to
another
from
one
bed
to
another
from
one
face
to
another
face
of
course
i
put
aside
at
once
the
captain
plan
moreover
i
had
no
need
of
this
last
conversation
with
him
to
know
the
sort
of
grotesque
and
sinister
mountebank
the
type
of
odd
humanity
that
he
represents
beyond
the
fact
that
his
physical
ugliness
is
complete
for
there
is
nothing
to
relieve
and
correct
it
he
gives
one
no
hold
on
his
soul
rose
believed
firmly
in
her
assured
domination
over
this
man
and
this
man
tricked
her
one
can
not
dominate
nothing
one
can
have
no
influence
over
emptiness
i
can
not
without
choking
with
laughter
think
of
myself
for
an
instant
in
the
arms
of
this
ridiculous
personage
and
caressing
him
yet
in
spite
of
this
i
am
content
and
i
feel
something
akin
to
pride
however
low
the
source
from
which
it
comes
it
is
none
the
less
an
homage
and
this
homage
strengthens
my
confidence
in
myself
and
in
my
beauty
quite
different
are
my
feelings
toward
joseph
joseph
has
taken
possession
of
my
mind
he
retains
it
he
holds
it
captive
he
obsesses
it
he
disturbs
me
bewitches
me
and
frightens
me
by
turns
certainly
he
is
ugly
brutally
horribly
ugly
but
when
you
analyze
this
ugliness
you
find
something
formidable
in
it
something
that
is
almost
beauty
that
is
more
than
beauty
that
is
above
beauty
something
elemental
i
do
not
conceal
from
myself
the
difficulty
the
danger
of
living
whether
married
or
not
with
such
a
man
of
whom
i
am
warranted
in
suspecting
everything
and
of
whom
in
reality
i
know
nothing
and
it
is
this
that
draws
me
to
him
with
a
dizzy
violence
at
least
he
is
capable
of
many
things
in
crime
perhaps
and
perhaps
also
in
the
direction
of
good
i
do
not
know
what
does
he
want
of
me
what
will
he
do
with
me
should
i
be
the
unscrupulous
instrument
of
plans
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
plaything
of
his
ferocious
passions
does
he
even
love
me
and
why
does
he
love
me
for
my
beauty
for
my
vices
for
my
intelligence
for
my
hatred
of
prejudices
he
who
makes
parade
of
all
the
prejudices
i
do
not
know
in
addition
to
this
attraction
which
the
unknown
and
mysterious
has
for
me
he
exercises
over
me
the
bitter
powerful
charm
of
force
and
this
charm
yes
this
charm
acts
more
and
more
on
my
nerves
conquers
my
passive
and
submissive
flesh
it
is
something
which
i
can
not
define
exactly
something
that
takes
me
wholly
by
my
mind
and
by
my
sex
revealing
in
me
instincts
of
which
i
was
unaware
instincts
that
slept
within
me
without
my
knowledge
and
that
no
love
no
thrill
of
voluptuousness
had
before
awakened
and
i
tremble
from
head
to
foot
when
i
remember
the
words
of
joseph
saying
to
me
you
are
like
me
célestine
oh
not
in
features
of
course
but
our
two
souls
are
alike
our
two
souls
resemble
each
other
our
two
souls
is
that
possible
these
sensations
that
i
feel
are
so
new
so
imperious
so
strongly
tenacious
that
they
do
not
leave
me
a
minute
rest
and
that
i
remain
always
under
the
influence
of
their
stupefying
fascination
in
vain
do
i
seek
to
occupy
my
mind
with
other
thoughts
i
try
to
read
and
walk
in
the
garden
when
my
masters
are
away
and
when
they
are
at
home
to
work
furiously
at
my
mending
in
the
impossible
joseph
has
complete
possession
of
my
thought
and
not
only
does
he
possess
it
in
the
present
but
he
possesses
it
also
in
the
past
joseph
so
interposes
himself
between
my
entire
past
and
myself
that
i
see
so
to
speak
nothing
but
him
and
that
this
past
with
all
its
ugly
or
charming
faces
draws
farther
and
farther
from
me
fades
away
disappears
cléophas
biscouille
jean
xavier
william
of
whom
i
have
not
yet
spoken
georges
himself
by
whom
i
believed
my
soul
to
have
been
branded
forever
as
the
shoulder
of
the
convict
is
branded
by
the
red
iron
and
all
those
to
whom
voluntarily
joyously
passionately
i
have
given
a
little
or
much
of
myself
of
my
vibrant
flesh
and
of
my
sorrowful
heart
all
of
them
shadows
already
uncertain
and
ludicrous
shadows
that
fade
away
until
they
are
hardly
recollections
and
then
become
confused
dreams
intangible
forgotten
realities
vapors
nothing
sometimes
in
the
kitchen
after
dinner
when
looking
at
joseph
and
his
criminal
mouth
and
his
criminal
eyes
and
his
heavy
and
his
low
knotty
humpy
forehead
upon
which
the
lamplight
accumulates
hard
shadows
i
say
to
myself
no
no
it
is
not
possible
i
am
under
the
influence
of
a
fit
of
madness
i
will
not
i
can
not
love
this
man
no
no
it
is
not
possible
and
yet
it
is
possible
and
it
is
true
and
i
must
at
last
confess
it
to
myself
cry
out
to
myself
i
love
joseph
ah
now
i
understand
why
one
should
never
make
sport
of
love
why
there
are
women
who
rush
with
all
the
consciencelessness
of
murder
with
all
the
invincible
force
of
nature
to
the
kisses
of
brutes
and
to
the
embraces
of
monsters
and
who
voluptuously
sound
the
in
the
sneering
faces
of
demons
and
bucks
joseph
has
obtained
from
madame
six
days
leave
of
absence
and
he
is
to
start
for
cherbourg
pretending
to
be
called
by
family
matters
it
is
decided
he
will
buy
the
little
café
but
for
some
months
he
will
not
run
it
himself
he
has
some
one
there
a
trusted
friend
who
is
to
take
charge
of
it
do
you
understand
he
says
to
me
it
must
first
be
repainted
and
made
to
look
like
new
it
must
be
very
fine
with
its
new
sign
in
gilt
letters
the
french
army
and
besides
i
can
not
leave
my
place
yet
that
i
can
not
do
why
not
joseph
because
i
can
not
now
but
when
will
you
go
for
good
joseph
scratches
his
neck
gives
me
a
sly
glance
and
says
as
to
that
i
do
not
know
perhaps
not
for
six
months
yet
perhaps
sooner
perhaps
even
later
i
can
not
tell
it
depends
i
feel
that
he
does
not
wish
to
speak
nevertheless
i
insist
it
depends
on
what
he
hesitates
to
answer
then
in
a
mysterious
and
at
the
same
time
somewhat
excited
tone
he
says
on
a
certain
matter
on
a
very
important
matter
but
what
matter
oh
on
a
certain
matter
that
all
this
is
uttered
in
a
brusque
voice
a
voice
not
of
anger
exactly
but
of
impatience
he
refuses
to
explain
further
he
says
nothing
to
me
of
myself
this
astonishes
me
and
causes
me
a
painful
disappointment
can
he
have
changed
his
mind
has
my
curiosity
my
hesitation
wearied
him
yet
it
is
very
natural
that
i
should
be
interested
in
an
event
in
the
success
or
failure
of
which
i
am
to
share
can
the
suspicion
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
hide
my
suspicion
of
the
outrage
committed
by
him
upon
the
little
claire
have
caused
joseph
to
reflect
further
and
brought
about
a
rupture
between
us
but
i
feel
from
the
tremor
of
my
heart
that
my
resolution
deferred
out
of
coquetry
out
of
a
disposition
to
tease
was
well
taken
to
be
free
to
be
enthroned
behind
a
bar
to
command
others
to
know
that
one
is
looked
at
desired
adored
by
so
many
men
and
that
is
not
to
be
and
this
dream
is
to
escape
me
as
all
the
others
have
i
do
not
wish
to
seem
to
be
throwing
myself
at
joseph
head
but
i
wish
to
know
what
he
has
in
his
mind
i
put
on
a
sad
face
and
i
sigh
when
you
have
gone
joseph
the
house
will
no
longer
be
endurable
to
me
i
have
become
so
accustomed
to
you
now
to
our
conversations
oh
indeed
i
too
shall
go
away
joseph
says
nothing
he
walks
up
and
down
the
with
anxious
brow
and
preoccupied
mind
his
hands
nervously
twirling
a
pair
of
in
the
pocket
of
his
blue
apron
the
expression
of
his
face
is
unpleasant
i
repeat
as
i
watch
him
go
back
and
forth
yes
i
shall
go
away
i
shall
return
to
paris
he
utters
not
a
word
of
protest
not
a
cry
not
even
an
imploring
glance
does
he
turn
upon
me
he
puts
a
stick
of
wood
in
the
stove
as
the
fire
is
low
and
then
begins
again
his
silent
promenade
up
and
down
the
room
why
is
he
like
this
does
he
then
accept
this
separation
does
he
want
it
has
he
then
lost
his
confidence
in
me
the
love
that
he
had
for
me
or
does
he
simply
fear
my
imprudence
my
eternal
questions
trembling
a
little
i
ask
him
will
it
cause
you
no
pain
joseph
if
we
do
not
see
each
other
again
without
halting
in
his
walk
without
even
glancing
at
me
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
in
the
manner
so
characteristic
of
him
he
says
of
course
but
what
can
you
expect
one
can
not
oblige
people
to
do
what
they
refuse
to
do
a
thing
either
pleases
or
it
does
not
please
what
have
i
refused
to
do
joseph
and
besides
you
are
always
full
of
bad
ideas
about
me
he
continues
without
answering
my
question
why
do
you
say
that
because
no
no
joseph
you
no
longer
love
me
you
have
something
else
in
mind
now
i
have
refused
nothing
i
have
reflected
that
is
all
it
is
natural
enough
is
it
one
does
not
make
a
without
reflection
my
hesitation
on
the
contrary
ought
to
make
you
think
well
of
me
it
proves
that
i
am
not
that
i
am
a
serious
woman
you
are
a
good
woman
célestine
an
orderly
woman
well
then
at
last
joseph
stops
walking
and
gazing
at
me
with
profound
and
still
suspicious
but
yet
tenderer
eyes
he
says
slowly
it
is
not
that
célestine
there
is
no
question
of
that
i
do
not
prevent
you
from
reflecting
reflect
all
you
like
there
is
plenty
of
time
and
we
will
talk
again
on
my
return
but
what
i
do
not
like
you
see
is
so
much
curiosity
there
are
things
that
do
not
concern
women
there
are
things
and
he
finishes
his
phrase
with
a
shake
of
his
head
after
a
moment
silence
he
resumes
i
have
nothing
else
in
mind
célestine
i
dream
of
you
i
am
crazy
over
you
as
true
as
the
good
god
exists
what
i
have
said
once
i
say
always
we
will
talk
it
over
again
but
you
must
not
be
curious
you
do
what
you
do
i
do
what
i
do
in
that
way
there
is
no
mistake
no
surprise
approaching
me
he
grasps
my
hands
i
have
a
hard
head
célestine
yes
indeed
but
what
is
in
it
stays
in
it
and
can
not
be
gotten
out
of
it
i
dream
of
you
célestine
of
you
in
the
little
café
xv
joseph
started
for
cherbourg
yesterday
morning
as
had
been
agreed
on
coming
down
stairs
i
find
him
already
gone
marianne
half
awake
with
swollen
eyes
and
hawking
throat
is
pumping
water
the
plate
from
which
joseph
has
just
eaten
his
soup
and
the
empty
are
still
on
the
kitchen
table
i
am
anxious
and
at
the
same
time
i
am
content
for
i
feel
that
starting
from
a
new
life
is
at
last
preparing
for
me
the
sun
has
scarcely
risen
the
air
is
cold
beyond
the
garden
the
country
is
still
sleeping
under
a
curtain
of
fog
and
in
the
distance
coming
from
an
invisible
valley
i
hear
the
very
feeble
sound
of
a
locomotive
whistle
it
is
the
train
that
bears
joseph
and
my
destiny
i
can
eat
no
breakfast
it
seems
to
me
that
something
huge
and
heavy
fills
my
stomach
i
no
longer
hear
the
whistle
the
fog
is
thickening
it
has
entered
the
garden
and
if
joseph
were
never
to
come
back
all
day
long
i
have
been
distracted
nervous
extremely
agitated
never
did
the
house
weigh
more
heavily
upon
me
never
did
the
long
corridors
seem
more
dismal
more
icily
silent
never
have
i
so
much
detested
the
crabbed
face
and
shrill
voice
of
madame
impossible
to
work
i
have
had
with
madame
a
very
violent
scene
in
consequence
of
which
i
really
thought
that
i
should
be
obliged
to
go
and
i
ask
myself
what
i
am
going
to
do
during
these
six
days
without
joseph
i
dread
the
ennui
of
being
alone
at
meals
with
marianne
i
really
need
somebody
to
talk
to
as
a
rule
as
soon
as
it
comes
night
marianne
under
the
influence
of
drink
falls
into
a
state
of
complete
stupefaction
her
brain
becomes
torpid
her
tongue
becomes
thick
her
lips
hang
and
shine
like
the
worn
brink
of
an
old
well
and
she
is
sad
sad
to
the
point
of
weeping
i
can
get
nothing
out
of
her
but
little
plaints
little
cries
something
like
the
puling
of
a
child
nevertheless
last
night
less
drunk
than
usual
she
confided
to
me
amid
groans
that
she
is
afraid
she
is
in
trouble
well
that
caps
the
climax
my
first
impulse
is
to
laugh
but
soon
i
feel
a
keen
sorrow
something
like
the
cutting
of
a
lash
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
suppose
it
were
through
joseph
i
remember
that
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
here
i
at
once
suspected
them
but
since
then
nothing
has
happened
to
justify
this
stupid
suspicion
on
the
contrary
no
no
it
is
impossible
it
can
not
be
i
ask
you
are
sure
marianne
sure
no
she
says
i
am
only
afraid
and
through
whom
she
hesitates
to
answer
then
suddenly
with
a
sort
of
pride
she
declares
through
monsieur
this
time
i
came
near
bursting
with
laughter
marianne
mistaking
my
laugh
for
one
of
admiration
begins
to
laugh
too
yes
yes
through
monsieur
she
repeats
i
am
going
to
see
madame
gouin
i
feel
a
real
pity
for
this
poor
woman
whose
brain
is
so
dark
and
whose
ideas
are
so
obscure
oh
how
melancholy
and
lamentable
she
is
and
what
is
going
to
happen
to
her
now
an
extraordinary
thing
love
has
given
her
no
radiance
no
grace
she
has
not
that
halo
of
light
with
which
voluptuousness
surrounds
the
ugliest
faces
she
has
remained
the
same
heavy
flabby
lumpy
i
left
her
with
a
somewhat
heavy
heart
now
i
laugh
no
more
i
will
never
laugh
at
marianne
again
and
the
pity
that
i
feel
for
her
turns
into
a
real
and
almost
painful
emotion
but
i
feel
that
my
emotion
especially
concerns
myself
on
returning
to
my
room
i
am
seized
with
a
sort
of
shame
and
great
discouragement
one
should
never
reflect
upon
love
how
sad
love
is
at
bottom
and
what
does
it
leave
behind
ridicule
bitterness
or
nothing
at
all
what
remains
to
me
now
of
monsieur
jean
whose
photograph
is
on
parade
on
the
mantel
in
its
red
plush
frame
nothing
except
my
disappointment
at
having
loved
a
vain
and
heartless
imbecile
can
i
really
have
loved
this
insipid
beauty
with
his
white
and
unhealthy
face
his
regulation
black
and
his
hair
parted
down
the
middle
this
photograph
irritates
me
i
can
no
longer
have
continually
before
me
those
two
stupid
eyes
that
look
at
me
with
the
unchangeable
look
of
an
insolent
and
servile
flunky
oh
no
let
it
go
to
keep
company
with
the
others
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
pending
the
time
when
i
shall
make
of
my
more
and
more
detested
past
a
fire
of
joy
and
ashes
and
i
think
of
joseph
where
is
he
at
the
present
moment
what
is
he
doing
is
he
even
thinking
of
me
undoubtedly
he
is
in
the
little
café
he
is
looking
discussing
measuring
he
is
picturing
to
himself
the
effect
that
i
shall
produce
at
the
bar
before
the
mirror
amid
the
dazzling
of
the
glasses
and
the
bottles
i
wish
that
i
knew
cherbourg
its
streets
its
squares
its
harbor
that
i
might
represent
joseph
to
myself
going
and
coming
conquering
the
city
as
he
has
conquered
me
i
turn
and
turn
again
in
my
bed
a
little
feverish
my
thought
goes
from
the
forest
of
raillon
to
cherbourg
from
the
body
of
claire
to
the
little
café
and
after
a
painful
period
of
insomnia
i
finally
go
off
to
sleep
with
the
stern
and
severe
image
of
joseph
before
my
eyes
the
motionless
image
of
joseph
outlining
itself
in
the
distance
against
a
dark
and
choppy
background
traversed
by
white
masts
and
red
yards
sunday
i
paid
a
visit
in
the
afternoon
to
joseph
room
the
two
dogs
follow
me
eagerly
they
seem
to
be
asking
me
where
joseph
is
a
little
iron
bed
a
large
cupboard
a
sort
of
low
commode
a
table
two
chairs
all
in
and
a
which
a
green
lustring
curtain
running
on
a
rod
protects
from
the
dust
these
constitute
the
furnishings
though
the
room
is
not
luxurious
it
is
extremely
orderly
and
clean
it
has
something
of
the
rigidity
and
austerity
of
a
monk
cell
in
a
convent
on
the
walls
between
the
portraits
of
déroulède
and
general
mercier
holy
pictures
unframed
virgins
an
adoration
of
the
magi
a
massacre
of
the
innocents
a
view
of
paradise
above
the
bed
a
large
crucifix
of
dark
wood
serving
as
a
basin
and
barred
with
a
branch
of
consecrated
box
it
is
not
very
delicate
to
be
sure
but
i
could
not
resist
my
violent
desire
to
search
everywhere
in
the
hope
vague
though
it
were
of
discovering
some
of
joseph
secrets
nothing
is
mysterious
in
this
room
nothing
is
hidden
it
is
the
naked
chamber
of
a
man
who
has
no
secrets
whose
life
is
pure
exempt
from
complications
and
events
the
keys
are
in
the
furniture
and
in
the
cupboards
not
a
drawer
is
locked
on
the
table
some
packages
of
seeds
and
a
book
the
good
gardener
on
the
mantel
a
whose
pages
are
yellow
and
a
little
in
which
have
been
copied
various
receipts
for
preparing
encaustic
bordelaise
stew
and
mixtures
of
nicotine
and
sulphate
of
iron
not
a
letter
anywhere
not
even
an
nowhere
the
slightest
trace
of
any
correspondence
either
on
business
politics
family
matters
or
love
in
the
commode
beside
shoes
and
old
piles
of
pamphlets
numerous
numbers
of
the
libre
parole
under
the
bed
and
i
have
felt
of
everything
turned
everything
upside
down
emptied
everything
coats
mattress
linen
and
drawers
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
cupboard
nothing
has
been
changed
it
is
just
as
i
left
it
a
week
ago
when
i
put
it
in
order
in
joseph
presence
is
it
possible
that
joseph
has
nothing
is
it
possible
that
he
is
so
lacking
in
those
thousand
little
intimate
and
familiar
things
whereby
a
man
reveals
his
tastes
his
passions
his
thoughts
a
little
of
that
which
dominates
his
life
ah
yes
here
from
the
back
of
the
i
take
a
wrapped
in
paper
and
strongly
tied
with
string
running
four
times
round
with
great
difficulty
i
untie
the
knots
i
open
the
box
and
on
a
bed
of
wadding
i
see
five
consecrated
medals
a
little
silver
crucifix
and
a
rosary
of
red
beads
always
religion
my
search
concluded
i
leave
the
room
filled
with
nervous
irritation
at
having
found
nothing
of
what
i
was
searching
for
and
having
learned
nothing
of
what
i
wanted
to
know
decidedly
joseph
communicates
his
impenetrability
to
everything
that
he
touches
the
articles
that
he
possesses
are
as
silent
as
his
lips
as
unfathomable
as
his
eyes
and
brow
the
rest
of
the
day
i
have
had
before
me
really
before
me
joseph
face
enigmatical
sneering
and
crusty
by
turns
and
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
hear
him
saying
to
me
and
much
farther
you
have
got
my
awkward
little
one
in
consequence
of
your
curiosity
ah
you
can
look
again
you
can
search
my
linen
my
trunks
my
soul
you
will
never
find
anything
out
i
do
not
wish
to
think
of
all
this
any
more
i
do
not
wish
to
think
of
joseph
any
more
my
head
aches
too
hard
and
i
believe
that
i
should
go
mad
let
us
return
to
my
memories
scarcely
had
i
left
the
good
sisters
of
neuilly
when
i
fell
again
into
the
hell
of
the
and
yet
i
had
firmly
resolved
never
to
apply
to
them
again
but
when
one
is
on
the
pavements
without
money
enough
to
buy
even
a
bit
of
bread
what
is
one
to
do
friends
old
comrades
bah
they
do
not
even
answer
you
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
they
cost
a
great
deal
and
involve
interminable
correspondence
a
great
lot
of
trouble
for
nothing
and
besides
they
are
very
risky
at
any
rate
one
must
have
something
ahead
and
cléclé
twenty
francs
had
quickly
melted
in
my
hands
prostitution
to
take
men
home
with
you
who
are
often
more
destitute
than
yourself
oh
no
indeed
for
pleasure
yes
as
much
as
you
like
but
for
money
i
can
not
i
do
not
know
how
i
am
always
victimized
i
was
even
obliged
to
hang
up
some
little
jewels
that
i
had
in
order
to
pay
for
my
board
and
lodging
inevitably
hard
luck
brings
you
back
to
the
agencies
of
usury
and
human
exploitation
oh
the
what
dirty
traps
they
are
in
the
first
place
one
must
give
ten
sous
to
have
her
name
entered
and
then
there
is
the
risk
of
getting
a
bad
place
in
these
frightful
dens
there
is
no
lack
of
bad
places
and
really
one
has
only
the
embarrassment
of
choice
between
hussies
and
blind
hussies
nowadays
women
with
nothing
at
all
keepers
of
little
fourpenny
grocery
stores
pretend
to
have
servants
and
to
play
the
of
countess
what
a
pity
if
after
discussions
and
humiliating
examinations
and
still
more
humiliating
haggling
you
succeed
in
coming
to
terms
with
one
of
these
rapacious
you
owe
to
the
keeper
of
the
three
per
cent
of
your
first
year
wages
so
much
the
worse
if
you
remain
but
ten
days
in
the
place
she
has
procured
for
you
that
does
not
concern
her
her
account
is
good
and
the
entire
commission
is
exacted
oh
they
know
the
trick
they
know
where
they
send
you
and
that
you
will
come
back
to
them
soon
once
for
instance
i
had
seven
places
in
four
months
and
a
half
a
run
on
the
black
impossible
houses
worse
than
prisons
well
i
had
to
pay
the
three
per
cent
of
seven
years
wages
that
is
including
the
ten
sous
required
for
each
fresh
entrance
of
my
name
more
than
ninety
francs
and
nothing
had
been
accomplished
and
all
had
to
be
begun
over
again
is
that
just
i
want
to
know
is
it
not
abominable
robbery
robbery
in
whatever
direction
one
turns
one
sees
nothing
but
robbery
anywhere
of
course
it
is
always
those
who
have
nothing
who
are
the
most
robbed
and
robbed
by
those
who
have
all
but
what
is
one
to
do
one
rages
and
rebels
and
then
ends
by
concluding
that
it
is
better
to
be
robbed
than
to
die
like
a
dog
in
the
street
oh
the
world
is
arranged
on
a
fine
plan
that
sure
what
a
pity
it
is
that
general
boulanger
did
not
succeed
at
least
he
it
seems
loved
domestics
the
in
which
i
was
stupid
enough
to
have
my
name
entered
is
situated
in
the
rue
du
colisée
at
the
back
of
a
on
the
third
floor
of
a
dark
and
very
old
house
almost
a
house
for
at
the
very
entrance
the
narrow
and
steep
staircase
with
its
filthy
steps
that
stick
to
your
shoes
and
its
damp
banister
that
sticks
to
your
hands
blows
into
your
face
an
infected
air
an
odor
of
sinks
and
closets
and
fills
your
heart
with
discouragement
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
fastidious
but
the
very
sight
of
this
staircase
turns
my
stomach
and
cuts
off
my
legs
and
i
am
seized
with
a
mad
desire
to
run
away
the
hope
which
on
the
way
has
been
singing
in
your
head
is
at
once
silenced
stifled
by
this
thick
and
sticky
atmosphere
by
these
vile
steps
and
these
sweating
walls
that
seem
to
be
frequented
by
glutinous
larvæ
and
cold
toads
really
i
do
not
understand
how
fine
ladies
dare
to
venture
into
this
unhealthy
hovel
frankly
they
are
not
disgusted
but
what
is
there
that
disgusts
fine
ladies
they
would
not
go
into
such
a
house
to
help
a
poor
person
but
to
worry
a
domestic
they
would
go
the
devil
knows
where
this
bureau
was
run
by
mme
a
tall
woman
of
almost
years
who
underneath
her
very
black
and
slightly
wavy
hair
and
in
spite
of
soft
flesh
crammed
into
a
terrible
corset
still
preserved
remnants
of
beauty
a
majestic
deportment
and
such
an
eye
my
but
she
must
have
had
fun
in
her
day
with
her
austere
elegance
always
wearing
a
black
dress
a
long
gold
chain
falling
in
loops
over
her
prominent
bosom
a
brown
velvet
cravat
around
her
neck
and
with
very
pale
hands
she
seemed
the
perfection
of
dignity
and
even
a
little
haughty
she
lived
outside
of
marriage
with
a
city
employee
louis
we
knew
him
only
by
his
christian
name
he
was
a
queer
type
extremely
with
mincing
movements
always
silent
and
presenting
a
very
awkward
appearance
in
a
grey
jacket
that
was
too
short
for
him
sad
timid
bent
although
young
he
seemed
not
happy
but
resigned
he
never
dared
to
speak
to
us
or
even
to
look
at
us
for
the
madame
was
very
jealous
when
he
came
in
with
his
bag
of
papers
under
his
arm
he
contented
himself
with
slightly
lifting
his
hat
in
our
direction
without
turning
his
head
toward
us
and
with
a
dragging
step
glided
into
the
hall
like
a
shadow
and
how
tired
the
poor
fellow
was
at
night
louis
attended
to
the
correspondence
kept
the
books
and
did
the
rest
mme
was
named
neither
paulhat
or
durand
these
two
names
which
go
so
well
together
she
acquired
it
seems
from
two
gentlemen
dead
with
whom
she
had
lived
and
who
had
supplied
her
with
funds
to
open
her
her
real
name
was
josephine
carp
like
many
keepers
of
she
was
an
old
chambermaid
that
was
to
be
seen
moreover
in
her
pretentious
bearing
in
her
manners
modeled
upon
those
of
the
great
ladies
in
whose
service
she
had
been
and
beneath
which
in
spite
of
her
gold
chain
and
black
silk
dress
one
could
see
the
filth
of
her
inferior
origin
she
showed
all
the
insolence
of
an
old
domestic
but
she
reserved
this
insolence
for
us
exclusively
showing
her
customers
on
the
contrary
a
servile
obsequiousness
proportioned
to
their
wealth
and
social
rank
oh
what
a
set
of
people
madame
the
countess
said
she
with
an
air
of
affectation
chambermaids
that
is
wenches
who
are
unwilling
to
do
anything
who
do
not
work
and
whose
honesty
and
morality
i
do
not
guarantee
as
many
of
those
as
you
want
but
women
who
work
who
sew
who
know
their
trade
there
are
no
more
of
them
i
have
no
more
of
them
nobody
has
any
more
of
them
that
the
way
it
is
yet
her
bureau
was
well
patronized
she
had
the
custom
especially
of
the
people
in
the
quarter
consisting
largely
of
foreigners
and
jewesses
ah
the
scandals
that
i
know
about
them
the
door
opens
into
a
hall
leading
to
the
where
mme
is
enthroned
in
her
perpetual
black
silk
dress
at
the
left
of
the
hall
is
a
sort
of
dark
hole
a
vast
with
circular
benches
and
in
the
middle
a
table
recovered
with
faded
red
serge
nothing
else
the
is
lighted
only
by
a
narrow
strip
of
glass
set
in
the
upper
part
of
the
partition
which
separates
the
room
from
the
and
running
its
entire
length
a
bad
light
a
light
more
gloomy
than
darkness
comes
through
this
glass
coating
objects
and
faces
with
something
less
than
a
twilight
glimmer
we
came
there
every
morning
and
every
afternoon
heaps
of
us
cooks
and
chambermaids
gardeners
and
valets
coachmen
and
butlers
and
we
spent
our
time
in
telling
each
other
of
our
misfortunes
in
running
down
the
masters
and
in
wishing
for
extraordinary
liberating
places
some
brought
books
and
newspapers
which
they
read
passionately
others
wrote
letters
now
gay
now
sad
our
buzzing
conversations
were
often
interrupted
by
the
sudden
irruption
of
mme
like
a
gust
of
wind
be
silent
young
women
she
cried
it
is
impossible
to
hear
ourselves
in
the
or
else
she
called
in
a
curt
shrill
voice
mademoiselle
jeanne
mlle
jeanne
rose
arranged
her
hair
a
little
followed
the
madame
into
the
bureau
from
which
she
returned
a
few
moments
later
with
a
grimace
of
disdain
upon
her
lips
her
recommendations
had
not
been
found
sufficient
what
did
they
require
then
the
monthyon
prize
a
diploma
or
else
they
had
been
unable
to
agree
upon
wages
oh
no
the
mean
things
a
dirty
dance
hall
nothing
to
pinch
she
does
her
own
marketing
oh
la
la
four
children
in
the
house
think
of
it
the
whole
punctuated
by
furious
or
obscene
gestures
we
all
passed
into
the
bureau
by
turns
summoned
by
mme
whose
voice
grew
shriller
and
shriller
and
whose
shining
flesh
at
last
became
green
with
anger
for
my
part
i
saw
directly
with
whom
i
had
to
deal
and
that
the
place
did
not
suit
me
then
to
amuse
myself
instead
of
submitting
to
their
stupid
questions
i
questioned
the
fine
ladies
themselves
madame
is
married
undoubtedly
ah
and
madame
has
children
certainly
dogs
yes
madame
makes
the
chambermaid
sit
up
when
i
go
out
in
the
evening
evidently
and
madame
often
goes
out
in
the
evening
pursing
up
her
lips
she
was
about
to
answer
but
i
casting
a
contemptuous
glance
at
her
hat
her
costume
and
her
entire
person
said
in
a
curt
and
disdainful
voice
i
regret
it
but
madame
place
does
not
please
me
i
do
not
go
into
houses
like
madame
and
i
sailed
out
triumphantly
one
day
a
little
woman
with
hair
outrageously
dyed
with
lips
painted
with
minium
with
enameled
cheeks
as
insolent
as
a
and
perfumed
like
a
bidet
after
asking
me
questions
put
a
are
you
well
behaved
do
you
receive
lovers
and
madame
i
answered
very
quietly
showing
no
astonishment
some
less
difficult
to
please
or
more
weary
or
more
timid
accepted
infected
places
they
were
hooted
voyage
we
shall
see
you
soon
again
at
the
sight
of
us
thus
piled
up
on
our
benches
with
legs
spread
apart
dreamy
stupid
or
chattering
and
listening
to
the
successive
calls
of
the
madame
mademoiselle
victoire
mademoiselle
irène
mademoiselle
zulma
it
sometimes
seemed
to
me
as
if
we
were
in
a
public
house
awaiting
the
next
caller
that
seemed
to
me
funny
or
sad
i
do
know
which
and
one
day
i
remarked
upon
it
aloud
there
was
a
general
outburst
of
laughter
each
one
immediately
delivered
herself
of
all
the
exact
and
marvelous
information
of
which
she
was
in
possession
concerning
establishments
of
that
character
a
fat
and
puffy
creature
who
was
peeling
an
orange
said
surely
that
would
be
better
they
are
sure
of
a
living
in
those
places
and
champagne
you
know
young
women
and
chemises
with
silver
stars
and
no
corsets
i
remember
that
that
day
i
thought
of
my
sister
louise
undoubtedly
shut
up
in
one
of
those
houses
i
pictured
to
myself
her
life
possibly
happy
at
least
tranquil
in
any
case
exempt
from
the
danger
of
poverty
and
hunger
and
more
than
ever
disgusted
with
my
dismal
and
beaten
youth
with
my
wandering
existence
with
my
dread
of
the
morrow
i
too
dreamed
yes
perhaps
that
would
be
better
and
evening
came
and
then
night
a
night
hardly
darker
than
the
day
we
became
silent
fatigued
from
having
talked
too
much
from
having
waited
too
long
a
gas
jet
was
lighted
in
the
hall
and
regularly
at
five
through
the
glass
in
the
door
we
could
see
the
outline
of
louis
passing
very
quickly
and
then
vanishing
it
was
the
signal
for
our
departure
often
old
women
runners
for
public
houses
pimps
with
a
respectable
air
and
quite
like
the
good
sisters
in
their
honeyed
sweetness
awaited
us
at
the
exit
on
the
sidewalk
they
followed
us
discreetly
and
in
some
darker
corner
of
the
street
behind
the
groups
of
trees
in
the
out
of
sight
of
the
police
they
approached
us
come
then
to
my
house
instead
of
dragging
out
your
poor
life
from
anxiety
to
anxiety
and
from
poverty
to
poverty
in
my
house
you
will
find
pleasure
luxury
money
you
will
find
liberty
dazzled
by
the
marvelous
promises
several
of
my
little
comrades
listened
to
these
with
sadness
i
saw
them
start
where
are
they
now
one
evening
one
of
these
prowlers
fat
and
flabby
whom
i
had
already
brutally
dismissed
succeeded
in
getting
me
to
go
with
her
to
a
café
in
the
where
she
offered
me
a
glass
of
chartreuse
i
see
her
still
with
her
hair
turning
grey
her
severe
costume
of
a
widow
her
plump
and
sticky
hands
loaded
with
rings
she
reeled
off
her
story
with
more
spirit
and
conviction
than
usual
and
as
i
remained
indifferent
to
all
her
humbug
inducements
she
cried
oh
if
you
only
would
my
little
one
i
do
not
need
to
look
at
you
twice
to
see
how
beautiful
you
are
in
all
respects
and
it
is
a
real
crime
to
let
such
beauty
go
to
waste
and
be
squandered
in
the
company
of
with
your
beauty
you
would
quickly
make
a
fortune
oh
you
would
have
a
bag
of
money
in
a
very
little
time
you
see
i
have
a
wonderful
set
of
customers
old
gentlemen
very
influential
and
very
very
generous
all
that
is
best
in
paris
comes
to
my
house
famous
generals
powerful
magistrates
foreign
ambassadors
she
drew
nearer
to
me
lowering
her
voice
and
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
the
president
of
the
republic
himself
why
yes
my
little
one
that
gives
you
an
idea
of
what
my
house
is
there
is
not
one
like
it
in
the
world
rabineau
is
nothing
side
of
my
house
and
stay
yesterday
at
five
the
president
was
so
well
pleased
that
he
promised
me
the
academic
palms
for
my
son
who
is
chief
auditor
in
a
religious
educational
institution
at
auteuil
she
looked
at
me
a
long
time
searching
me
body
and
soul
and
repeated
oh
if
you
would
what
a
success
i
offered
a
heap
of
objections
my
lack
of
fine
linen
of
costumes
of
jewels
the
old
woman
reassured
me
oh
if
that
all
said
she
you
need
not
worry
because
in
my
house
you
understand
natural
beauty
is
the
chief
adornment
yes
yes
i
know
but
still
i
assure
you
that
you
need
not
worry
she
insisted
with
benevolence
listen
sign
a
contract
with
me
for
three
months
and
i
will
give
you
an
outfit
of
the
best
such
as
no
soubrette
of
the
ever
had
my
word
for
it
i
asked
time
to
reflect
well
all
right
reflect
counseled
this
dealer
in
human
flesh
let
me
give
you
my
address
at
any
rate
when
your
heart
speaks
well
you
will
have
only
to
come
oh
i
am
perfectly
confident
and
i
am
going
to
announce
you
to
the
president
of
the
republic
we
had
finished
drinking
the
old
woman
settled
for
the
two
glasses
and
took
from
a
little
black
a
card
which
she
slyly
slipped
into
my
hand
when
she
had
gone
i
looked
at
the
card
and
i
read
madame
rebecca
ranvet
at
mme
i
witnessed
some
extraordinary
scenes
as
i
can
not
describe
them
all
unfortunately
i
select
one
to
serve
as
an
example
of
what
goes
on
daily
in
this
house
i
have
said
that
the
upper
part
of
the
partition
separating
the
from
the
bureau
consists
of
a
strip
of
glass
covered
with
transparent
curtains
in
the
middle
of
the
strip
is
a
ordinarily
closed
one
day
i
noticed
that
by
some
oversight
of
which
i
resolved
to
take
advantage
it
had
been
left
partly
open
putting
a
small
stool
upon
the
bench
i
stood
upon
it
and
thus
succeeded
in
touching
with
my
chin
the
frame
of
the
which
i
softly
pushed
i
was
thus
enabled
to
look
into
the
room
and
here
is
what
i
saw
a
lady
was
seated
in
an
a
chambermaid
was
standing
in
front
of
her
in
the
corner
mme
was
distributing
some
cards
among
the
compartments
of
a
drawer
the
lady
had
come
from
fontainebleau
in
search
of
a
servant
she
may
have
been
fifty
years
old
in
appearance
a
rich
and
rough
dressed
soberly
provincial
in
her
austerity
the
maid
puny
and
sickly
with
a
complexion
that
had
been
made
livid
by
poor
food
and
lack
of
food
had
nevertheless
a
sympathetic
face
which
under
more
fortunate
circumstances
would
perhaps
have
been
pretty
she
was
very
clean
and
trim
in
a
black
skirt
a
black
jersey
moulded
her
thin
form
and
on
her
head
she
wore
a
linen
cap
prettily
set
back
revealing
her
brow
and
her
curly
brown
hair
after
a
detailed
sustained
offensive
aggressive
examination
the
lady
at
last
made
up
her
mind
to
speak
then
said
she
you
offer
yourself
as
what
as
a
chambermaid
yes
madame
you
do
not
look
like
one
what
is
your
name
jeanne
le
godec
what
did
you
say
jeanne
le
godec
madame
the
lady
shrugged
her
shoulders
jeanne
she
exclaimed
that
is
not
a
servant
name
that
is
a
name
for
a
young
girl
if
you
enter
my
service
you
do
not
expect
i
suppose
to
keep
this
name
jeanne
as
madame
likes
jeanne
had
lowered
her
head
and
was
leaning
with
her
two
hands
on
the
handle
of
her
umbrella
raise
your
head
ordered
the
lady
stand
up
straight
do
you
see
you
are
making
a
hole
in
the
carpet
with
the
point
of
your
umbrella
where
do
you
come
from
from
from
and
she
gave
a
pout
of
disdain
that
quickly
turned
into
a
frightful
grimace
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
eyes
contracted
as
if
she
had
swallowed
a
glass
of
vinegar
from
she
repeated
then
you
are
a
breton
oh
i
do
not
like
the
bretons
they
are
obstinate
and
dirty
i
am
very
clean
madame
protested
the
poor
jeanne
you
say
so
however
we
have
reached
that
yet
how
old
are
you
not
counting
the
nursing
months
no
doubt
you
look
much
older
it
is
not
worth
while
to
deceive
me
i
am
not
deceiving
madame
i
assure
madame
i
am
only
if
i
look
older
it
is
because
i
have
been
sick
a
long
time
oh
you
have
been
sick
replied
the
in
a
voice
of
sneering
severity
oh
you
have
been
sick
a
long
time
i
warn
you
my
girl
that
the
place
though
not
a
very
hard
one
is
of
some
importance
and
that
i
must
have
a
woman
of
very
good
health
jeanne
tried
to
repair
her
imprudent
words
she
declared
oh
i
am
cured
quite
cured
that
is
your
affair
moreover
we
have
reached
that
yet
you
are
married
or
single
which
what
are
you
i
am
a
widow
madame
ah
you
have
no
child
i
suppose
and
as
jeanne
did
not
answer
directly
the
lady
insisted
more
sharply
say
have
you
children
yes
or
no
i
have
a
little
girl
she
confessed
timidly
then
making
grimaces
and
gestures
as
if
she
were
scattering
a
lot
of
flies
she
cried
oh
no
child
in
the
house
no
child
in
the
house
not
under
any
consideration
where
is
your
little
girl
she
is
with
my
husband
aunt
and
what
is
this
aunt
she
keeps
a
in
rouen
a
deplorable
calling
drunkenness
and
debauchery
that
is
a
pretty
example
for
a
little
girl
however
that
concerns
you
that
is
your
affair
how
old
is
your
little
girl
eighteen
months
madame
madame
gave
a
start
and
turned
violently
in
her
this
was
too
much
for
her
she
was
scandalized
a
sort
of
growl
escaped
from
her
lips
children
think
of
it
children
when
one
can
not
bring
them
up
or
have
them
at
home
these
people
are
incorrigible
the
devil
is
in
their
bodies
becoming
more
and
more
aggressive
and
even
ferocious
she
addressed
herself
to
jeanne
again
who
stood
trembling
before
her
gaze
i
warn
you
said
she
enunciating
each
word
separately
i
warn
you
that
if
you
enter
my
service
i
will
not
allow
you
to
bring
your
little
girl
to
my
house
no
goings
and
comings
in
the
house
i
want
no
goings
and
comings
in
the
house
no
no
no
strangers
no
vagabonds
no
unknown
people
one
is
exposed
quite
enough
with
the
ordinary
run
of
callers
oh
no
thank
you
in
spite
of
this
declaration
which
was
not
very
prepossessing
the
little
servant
dared
to
ask
nevertheless
in
that
case
madame
surely
will
permit
me
to
go
and
see
my
little
girl
once
a
year
just
once
a
year
no
such
was
the
reply
of
the
implacable
and
she
added
my
servants
never
go
out
it
is
the
principle
of
the
house
a
principle
on
which
i
am
not
willing
to
compromise
i
do
not
pay
domestics
that
they
may
make
the
round
of
doubtful
resorts
under
pretence
of
going
to
see
their
daughters
that
would
be
really
too
convenient
no
no
you
have
recommendations
yes
madame
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
paper
in
which
were
wrapped
some
recommendations
yellow
crumpled
and
soiled
and
she
silently
handed
them
to
madame
with
a
trembling
hand
madame
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
as
if
to
avoid
soiling
them
and
with
grimaces
of
disgust
unfolded
one
which
she
began
to
read
aloud
certify
that
the
girl
j
suddenly
interrupting
herself
she
cast
an
atrocious
look
at
jeanne
who
was
growing
more
anxious
and
troubled
girl
it
plainly
says
then
you
are
not
married
you
have
a
child
and
you
are
not
married
what
does
that
mean
the
servant
explained
i
ask
madame
pardon
i
have
been
married
for
three
years
and
this
recommendation
was
written
six
years
ago
madame
can
see
the
date
for
herself
well
that
is
your
affair
and
she
resumed
her
reading
of
the
recommendation
the
girl
jeanne
le
godec
has
been
in
my
service
for
thirteen
months
and
that
i
have
no
cause
of
complaint
against
her
on
the
score
of
work
behavior
and
honesty
yes
it
is
always
the
same
thing
recommendations
that
say
nothing
that
prove
nothing
they
give
one
no
information
where
can
one
write
to
this
lady
she
is
dead
she
is
dead
to
be
sure
evidently
she
is
dead
so
you
have
a
recommendation
and
the
very
person
who
gave
it
to
you
is
dead
you
will
confess
that
has
a
somewhat
doubtful
look
all
this
was
said
with
a
very
humiliating
expression
of
suspicion
and
in
a
tone
of
gross
irony
she
took
another
recommendation
and
this
person
she
is
dead
too
no
doubt
no
madame
mme
robert
is
in
algeria
with
her
husband
who
is
a
colonel
in
algeria
exclaimed
the
lady
naturally
how
do
you
expect
anybody
to
write
to
algeria
some
are
dead
others
are
in
algeria
the
idea
of
seeking
information
in
algeria
this
is
all
very
extraordinary
but
i
have
others
madame
implored
the
unfortunate
jeanne
le
godec
madame
can
see
for
herself
madame
can
inform
herself
yes
yes
i
see
you
have
many
others
i
see
that
you
have
been
in
many
places
much
too
many
places
at
your
age
that
is
not
very
prepossessing
well
leave
me
your
recommendations
and
i
will
see
now
something
else
what
can
you
do
i
can
do
housework
sew
wait
on
table
are
you
good
at
mending
yes
madame
do
you
know
how
to
fatten
poultry
no
madame
that
is
not
my
business
your
business
my
girl
declared
the
lady
severely
is
to
do
what
your
masters
tell
you
to
do
you
must
have
a
detestable
character
why
no
madame
i
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
talk
back
naturally
you
say
so
they
all
say
so
and
they
are
not
to
be
touched
with
a
pair
of
tongs
well
let
me
see
i
believe
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
place
while
not
particularly
hard
is
of
some
importance
the
servants
rise
at
five
in
winter
too
in
winter
too
yes
certainly
and
why
do
you
say
winter
too
is
there
less
work
to
be
done
in
winter
what
a
ridiculous
question
the
chambermaid
does
the
stairs
the
monsieur
study
the
chamber
of
course
and
attends
to
all
the
fires
the
cook
does
the
the
halls
and
the
i
am
very
particular
on
the
score
of
cleanliness
i
can
not
bear
to
see
a
speck
of
dust
in
the
house
the
must
be
well
polished
the
furniture
must
shine
and
the
mirrors
must
be
thoroughly
cleaned
the
chambermaid
has
charge
of
the
but
madame
i
know
nothing
about
well
you
will
learn
the
chambermaid
soaps
washes
and
irons
except
monsieur
shirts
she
does
the
sewing
i
have
no
sewing
done
outside
except
the
making
of
my
costumes
she
waits
on
table
helps
the
cook
to
wipe
the
dishes
and
does
the
polishing
there
must
be
order
perfect
order
i
am
a
stickler
for
order
and
cleanliness
and
especially
for
honesty
moreover
everything
is
under
lock
and
key
if
anything
is
wanted
i
must
be
asked
for
it
i
have
a
horror
of
waste
what
are
you
accustomed
to
take
in
the
morning
coffee
with
milk
madame
coffee
with
milk
you
do
not
stint
yourself
yes
in
these
days
they
all
take
coffee
with
milk
well
that
is
not
the
custom
in
my
house
you
will
take
soup
it
is
better
for
the
stomach
what
did
you
say
jeanne
had
said
nothing
but
it
was
evident
she
was
making
an
effort
to
say
something
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
i
ask
madame
pardon
but
what
does
madame
give
us
to
drink
six
quarts
of
cider
a
week
i
can
not
drink
cider
madame
the
doctor
has
forbidden
me
to
ah
the
doctor
has
forbidden
you
to
well
i
will
give
you
six
quarts
of
cider
if
you
want
wine
you
will
buy
it
that
concerns
you
what
pay
do
you
expect
she
hesitated
looked
at
the
carpet
the
clock
and
the
ceiling
rolled
her
umbrella
in
her
hands
and
said
timidly
forty
francs
forty
francs
exclaimed
madame
why
do
you
say
ten
thousand
francs
and
done
with
it
you
must
be
crazy
forty
francs
why
it
is
unheard
of
we
used
to
pay
fifteen
francs
and
got
much
better
service
forty
francs
and
you
do
not
even
know
how
to
fatten
poultry
you
do
not
know
how
to
do
anything
i
pay
thirty
francs
and
i
think
that
altogether
too
much
you
have
no
expenses
in
my
house
i
am
not
exacting
as
to
what
you
wear
and
you
are
washed
and
fed
god
knows
how
well
you
are
fed
i
give
out
the
portions
myself
jeanne
insisted
i
have
had
forty
francs
in
all
the
places
where
i
have
worked
but
the
lady
had
risen
and
in
a
dry
and
ugly
voice
she
exclaimed
well
you
had
better
go
back
to
them
forty
francs
such
impudence
here
are
your
recommendations
your
recommendations
from
dead
people
be
off
with
you
jeanne
carefully
wrapped
up
her
recommendations
put
them
back
into
the
pocket
of
her
dress
and
then
said
imploringly
in
a
timid
and
sorrowful
voice
if
madame
will
go
as
high
as
francs
we
could
come
to
terms
not
a
sou
be
off
with
you
go
to
algeria
to
find
again
your
mme
robert
go
where
you
like
there
is
no
lack
of
vagabonds
like
you
there
are
heaps
of
them
be
off
with
you
with
sad
face
and
slow
step
jeanne
left
the
bureau
after
curtseying
twice
i
saw
from
her
eyes
and
lips
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
crying
left
alone
the
lady
shouted
furiously
ah
these
domestics
what
a
plague
it
is
impossible
to
be
served
these
days
to
which
mme
who
had
finished
sorting
her
cards
answered
majestic
crushed
and
severe
i
had
warned
you
madame
they
are
all
like
that
they
are
unwilling
to
do
anything
and
expect
to
earn
hundreds
and
thousands
i
have
nothing
else
all
the
others
are
worse
i
will
try
to
find
you
something
oh
it
is
very
distressing
i
assure
you
i
got
down
from
my
post
of
observation
the
very
moment
that
jeanne
le
godec
was
the
amid
an
uproar
well
they
asked
her
she
went
and
sat
down
on
her
bench
at
the
rear
of
the
room
and
there
with
lowered
head
folded
arms
heavy
heart
and
empty
stomach
she
remained
in
silence
her
two
little
feet
twitching
nervously
under
her
gown
but
i
saw
things
sadder
still
among
the
girls
who
came
daily
to
mme
i
had
noticed
one
especially
in
the
first
place
because
she
wore
a
breton
cap
and
then
because
the
very
sight
of
her
filled
me
with
unconquerable
melancholy
a
peasant
girl
astray
in
paris
in
this
frightful
jostling
feverish
paris
i
know
nothing
more
lamentable
involuntarily
it
invites
me
to
a
survey
of
my
own
past
and
moves
me
infinitely
where
is
she
going
where
does
she
come
from
why
did
she
leave
her
home
what
madness
what
tragedy
what
tempest
has
pushed
her
forth
and
stranded
her
a
sorrowful
waif
in
this
roaring
human
sea
these
questions
i
asked
myself
every
day
as
i
examined
this
poor
girl
sitting
in
her
corner
so
frightfully
isolated
she
was
ugly
with
that
definitive
ugliness
which
excludes
all
idea
of
pity
and
makes
people
ferocious
because
it
is
really
an
offence
to
them
however
disgraced
she
may
be
by
nature
a
woman
rarely
reaches
the
point
of
total
and
absolute
ugliness
utter
degeneracy
from
the
human
estate
generally
she
has
something
no
matter
what
eyes
a
mouth
an
undulation
of
the
body
a
bending
of
the
hips
or
less
than
that
a
movement
of
the
arms
a
coupling
of
the
wrist
a
freshness
of
skin
upon
which
others
may
rest
their
eyes
without
being
offended
even
in
the
very
old
a
certain
grace
almost
always
survives
the
deformations
of
the
body
the
death
of
sex
and
the
seamy
flesh
betrays
some
souvenir
of
what
they
formerly
were
the
breton
had
nothing
of
the
kind
and
she
was
very
young
little
angular
with
flat
hips
and
legs
so
short
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
really
called
to
mind
those
barbarian
virgins
those
saints
shapeless
blocks
of
granite
that
have
been
leaning
for
centuries
in
loneliness
on
the
inclined
arms
of
armorican
calvaries
and
her
face
ah
the
unfortunate
an
overhanging
brow
pupils
so
dim
in
outline
that
they
seemed
to
have
been
rubbed
with
a
rag
a
horrible
nose
flat
at
the
start
gashed
with
a
furrow
down
the
middle
and
suddenly
turning
up
at
its
tip
and
opening
into
two
black
round
deep
enormous
holes
fringed
with
stiff
hair
and
over
all
this
a
gray
and
scaly
skin
the
skin
of
a
dead
adder
a
skin
that
in
the
light
looked
as
if
it
had
been
sprinkled
with
flour
yet
the
unspeakable
creature
had
one
beauty
that
many
beautiful
women
would
have
envied
her
hair
magnificent
heavy
thick
hair
of
a
resplendent
red
reflecting
gold
and
purple
but
far
from
being
a
palliation
of
her
ugliness
this
hair
only
aggravated
it
making
it
more
striking
fulgurating
irreparable
this
is
not
all
every
movement
that
she
made
was
clumsy
she
could
not
take
a
step
without
running
against
something
everything
she
took
into
her
hands
she
was
sure
to
let
fall
her
arms
hit
against
the
furniture
and
swept
off
everything
that
was
lying
on
it
when
walking
she
stepped
on
your
toes
and
dug
her
elbows
into
your
breast
then
she
excused
herself
with
a
harsh
and
sullen
voice
a
voice
that
breathed
into
your
face
a
tainted
odor
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
there
at
once
arose
among
us
a
sort
of
irritated
complaint
which
quickly
changed
into
insulting
recriminations
and
ended
in
growls
the
wretched
creature
was
hooted
as
she
crossed
the
room
rolling
along
on
her
short
legs
passed
on
from
one
to
another
like
a
ball
until
she
reached
her
bench
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
every
one
pretended
to
draw
away
from
her
with
significant
gestures
of
disgust
and
grimaces
that
were
accompanied
with
a
lifting
of
handkerchiefs
then
in
the
empty
space
instantaneously
formed
behind
the
sanitary
cordon
that
isolated
her
from
us
the
dismal
girl
sat
leaning
against
the
wall
silent
and
detested
without
a
complaint
without
revolt
without
seeming
to
understand
that
all
this
contempt
was
meant
for
her
although
not
to
be
unlike
the
others
i
sometimes
took
part
in
this
cruel
sport
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
sort
of
pity
for
the
little
breton
i
understood
that
here
was
a
being
predestined
to
misfortune
one
of
those
beings
who
whatever
they
may
do
and
wherever
they
may
go
will
be
eternally
repulsed
by
men
and
also
by
beasts
for
there
is
a
certain
height
of
ugliness
a
certain
form
of
infirmity
that
the
beasts
themselves
do
not
tolerate
one
day
overcoming
my
disgust
i
approached
her
and
asked
what
is
your
name
louise
randon
i
am
a
breton
from
audierne
and
you
too
are
a
breton
are
you
not
astonished
that
anyone
was
willing
to
speak
to
her
and
fearing
some
insult
or
practical
joke
she
did
not
answer
directly
she
buried
her
thumb
in
the
deep
caverns
of
her
nose
i
repeated
my
question
from
what
part
of
brittany
do
you
come
then
she
looked
at
me
and
seeing
undoubtedly
that
there
was
no
unkindness
in
my
eyes
she
decided
to
answer
i
am
from
near
lannion
i
knew
not
what
further
to
say
to
her
her
voice
was
repulsive
to
me
it
was
not
a
voice
it
was
something
hoarse
and
broken
like
a
hiccup
a
sort
of
gurgle
this
voice
drove
away
my
pity
however
i
went
on
you
have
relatives
living
yes
my
father
my
mother
two
brothers
four
sisters
i
am
the
oldest
and
your
father
what
does
he
do
he
is
a
blacksmith
you
are
poor
my
father
has
three
fields
three
houses
three
then
he
is
rich
surely
he
is
rich
he
cultivates
his
fields
and
rents
his
houses
and
goes
about
the
country
with
his
and
threshes
the
peasants
wheat
and
my
brother
shoes
the
horses
and
your
sisters
they
have
beautiful
lace
caps
and
embroidered
gowns
and
you
i
have
nothing
i
drew
further
away
that
i
might
not
get
the
mortal
odor
of
this
voice
why
are
you
a
domestic
i
resumed
because
why
did
you
leave
home
because
you
were
not
happy
she
spoke
very
quickly
in
a
voice
that
rushed
and
rolled
the
words
out
like
pebbles
my
father
whipped
me
my
mother
whipped
me
my
sisters
whipped
me
everybody
whipped
me
they
made
me
do
everything
i
brought
up
my
sisters
why
did
they
whip
you
i
do
not
know
just
to
whip
me
in
all
families
there
is
some
one
who
is
whipped
because
well
one
does
not
know
my
questions
no
longer
annoyed
her
she
was
gaining
confidence
and
you
she
said
to
me
did
not
your
parents
whip
you
oh
yes
of
course
that
is
how
things
are
louise
was
no
longer
exploring
her
nose
her
two
hands
with
their
nails
lay
flat
upon
her
thighs
whispering
was
going
on
around
us
laughs
quarrels
and
lamentations
prevented
the
others
from
hearing
our
conversation
but
how
did
you
happen
to
come
to
paris
i
asked
after
a
silence
last
year
answered
louise
there
was
a
lady
from
paris
at
who
was
taking
the
with
her
children
she
had
discharged
her
domestic
for
stealing
and
i
offered
to
go
to
work
for
her
and
so
she
took
me
with
her
to
paris
to
take
care
of
her
father
an
old
invalid
whose
legs
were
paralyzed
and
you
did
not
stay
in
your
place
in
paris
it
is
not
the
same
thing
no
she
exclaimed
energetically
i
could
have
remained
it
was
not
that
but
i
was
not
treated
right
her
dull
eyes
lighted
up
strangely
something
like
a
gleam
of
pride
passed
over
them
and
her
body
straightened
up
and
became
almost
transfigured
i
was
not
treated
right
she
repeated
the
old
man
made
advances
to
me
for
a
moment
i
was
stunned
by
this
revelation
was
it
possible
then
a
desire
even
that
of
a
low
and
nasty
old
man
had
been
felt
for
this
bundle
of
shapeless
flesh
this
monstrous
irony
of
nature
a
kiss
had
wished
to
place
itself
upon
these
decaying
teeth
and
mingle
with
this
rotten
breath
ah
what
filthy
things
men
are
what
a
frightful
madness
then
is
love
i
looked
at
louise
but
the
flame
had
gone
out
of
her
eyes
once
more
her
pupils
looked
like
dead
gray
spots
that
was
some
time
ago
i
asked
three
months
and
since
then
you
have
found
no
place
nobody
wants
me
i
do
not
know
why
when
i
enter
the
bureau
all
the
ladies
cry
out
at
the
sight
of
me
no
i
do
want
there
must
surely
be
some
spell
over
me
for
you
know
i
am
not
ugly
i
am
very
strong
i
know
my
work
and
my
will
is
good
if
i
am
too
small
it
is
not
my
fault
surely
some
one
has
thrown
a
spell
over
me
how
do
you
live
in
a
i
do
all
the
chambers
and
i
mend
the
linen
they
give
me
a
mattress
in
the
garret
and
a
meal
in
the
morning
there
were
some
then
that
were
more
unfortunate
than
myself
this
egoistic
thought
brought
back
the
pity
that
had
vanished
from
my
heart
listen
my
little
louise
i
said
in
a
voice
which
i
tried
to
make
as
tender
and
convincing
as
possible
places
in
paris
are
very
hard
one
has
to
know
many
things
and
the
masters
are
more
exacting
than
elsewhere
i
am
much
afraid
for
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
home
again
but
louise
became
frightened
no
no
she
exclaimed
never
i
do
not
want
to
go
home
they
would
say
that
i
had
not
succeeded
that
nobody
wanted
me
they
would
laugh
at
me
too
much
no
no
it
is
impossible
i
would
rather
die
just
then
the
door
of
the
opened
the
shrill
voice
of
mme
called
mademoiselle
louise
randon
are
they
calling
me
asked
louise
frightened
and
trembling
why
yes
it
is
you
go
quickly
and
try
to
succeed
this
time
she
arose
gave
me
a
dig
in
the
ribs
with
her
outstretched
elbows
stepped
on
my
feet
ran
against
the
table
and
rolling
along
on
her
too
short
legs
disappeared
followed
by
hoots
i
mounted
my
stool
and
pushed
open
the
to
watch
the
scene
that
was
about
to
take
place
never
did
mme
seem
to
me
gloomier
yet
god
knows
whether
it
had
frozen
my
soul
every
time
i
had
entered
it
oh
that
furniture
upholstered
in
blue
rep
turned
yellow
by
wear
that
huge
book
of
record
spread
like
the
split
carcass
of
a
beast
on
the
table
also
covered
with
blue
rep
spotted
with
ink
and
that
desk
where
louis
elbows
had
left
bright
and
shining
spots
on
the
dark
wood
and
the
sideboard
at
the
rear
upon
which
stood
foreign
glassware
and
handed
down
from
ancestors
and
on
the
mantel
between
two
lamps
which
had
lost
their
bronze
between
photographs
that
had
lost
their
color
that
tiresome
clock
whose
enervating
made
the
hours
longer
and
that
cage
in
which
two
homesick
canaries
swelled
their
damaged
plumage
and
that
mahogany
case
of
scratched
by
greedy
nails
but
i
had
not
taken
my
post
of
observation
for
the
purpose
of
taking
an
inventory
of
this
room
which
i
knew
alas
too
well
this
lugubrious
interior
so
tragic
in
spite
of
its
obscurity
that
many
times
my
maddened
imagination
transformed
it
into
a
gloomy
for
the
sale
of
human
meat
no
i
wanted
to
see
louise
randon
in
the
clutches
of
the
there
she
was
near
the
window
in
a
false
light
standing
motionless
with
hanging
arms
a
hard
shadow
like
a
thick
veil
added
confusion
to
the
ugliness
of
her
face
and
made
still
more
of
a
heap
of
the
short
and
massive
deformity
of
her
body
a
hard
light
illuminated
the
lower
locks
of
her
hair
enhanced
the
shapelessness
of
her
arms
and
breast
and
lost
itself
in
the
dark
folds
of
her
deplorable
skirt
an
old
lady
was
examining
her
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
with
her
back
toward
me
a
hostile
back
a
ferocious
neck
of
this
old
lady
i
saw
nothing
but
her
black
cap
with
its
ridiculous
plumes
her
black
cape
whose
lining
turned
up
at
the
bottom
in
grey
fur
and
her
black
gown
which
made
rings
upon
the
carpet
i
saw
especially
lying
upon
one
of
her
knees
her
hand
gloved
with
black
a
knotty
and
gouty
hand
that
moved
slowly
about
the
fingers
stretching
out
and
drawing
back
clutching
the
material
of
her
dress
as
talons
fasten
upon
living
prey
standing
near
the
table
very
erect
and
dignified
mme
was
waiting
it
seems
a
small
matter
does
it
not
the
meeting
of
these
three
commonplace
beings
in
this
commonplace
setting
in
this
very
ordinary
fact
there
was
nothing
to
cause
one
to
stop
nothing
to
move
one
nevertheless
it
seemed
to
me
an
enormous
drama
these
three
persons
silently
gazing
at
one
another
i
felt
that
i
was
witnessing
a
social
tragedy
terrible
agonizing
worse
than
a
murder
my
throat
was
dry
my
heart
beat
violently
i
do
not
get
a
good
view
of
you
my
little
one
said
the
old
lady
suddenly
do
not
stay
there
i
do
not
get
a
good
view
of
you
go
to
the
rear
of
the
room
that
i
may
see
you
better
and
she
cried
in
an
astonished
voice
my
god
how
little
you
are
in
saying
these
words
she
had
moved
her
chair
and
now
i
had
a
sight
of
her
profile
i
expected
to
see
a
hooked
nose
long
teeth
protruding
from
the
mouth
and
the
round
and
yellow
eye
of
a
hawk
not
at
all
her
face
was
calm
rather
amiable
in
truth
there
was
no
expression
at
all
in
her
eyes
either
kind
or
unkind
she
must
have
been
an
old
retired
from
business
merchants
have
this
faculty
of
acquiring
a
special
physiognomy
revealing
nothing
of
their
inner
nature
in
proportion
as
they
grow
hardened
in
their
business
and
as
the
habit
of
unjust
and
rapid
gains
develops
low
instincts
and
ferocious
ambitions
the
expression
of
their
face
softens
or
rather
becomes
neutralized
that
in
them
which
is
bad
that
which
might
inspire
distrust
in
their
customers
hides
itself
in
the
privacies
of
their
being
or
takes
refuge
on
corporeal
surfaces
that
are
ordinarily
destitute
of
any
expression
whatever
in
this
old
lady
the
hardness
of
her
soul
invisible
in
her
eyes
in
her
mouth
in
her
forehead
in
all
the
relaxed
muscles
of
her
flabby
face
was
exhibited
prominently
in
her
neck
her
neck
was
her
real
face
and
this
face
was
terrible
louise
obeying
the
old
lady
command
had
gone
to
the
rear
of
the
room
the
desire
to
please
gave
her
a
really
monstrous
look
and
a
discouraging
attitude
scarcely
had
she
placed
herself
in
the
light
when
the
lady
cried
oh
how
ugly
you
are
my
little
one
and
calling
mme
to
witness
can
there
really
be
creatures
on
earth
as
ugly
as
this
little
one
ever
solemn
and
dignified
mme
answered
undoubtedly
she
is
not
a
beauty
but
mademoiselle
is
very
honest
possibly
replied
the
lady
but
she
is
too
ugly
such
ugliness
is
in
the
last
degree
disagreeable
what
what
did
you
say
louise
had
not
uttered
a
word
she
had
simply
blushed
a
little
and
lowered
her
head
her
dull
eyes
were
surrounded
with
a
red
streak
i
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
well
let
us
look
into
this
resumed
the
lady
whose
fingers
at
this
moment
furiously
agitated
were
tearing
the
material
of
her
gown
with
the
movements
of
a
cruel
beast
she
questioned
louise
regarding
her
family
her
previous
places
and
her
capacities
for
cooking
sewing
and
doing
housework
louise
answered
yes
indeed
or
no
indeed
hoarsely
and
spasmodically
the
examination
fastidious
unkind
criminal
lasted
twenty
minutes
well
my
little
one
concluded
the
old
lady
the
clearest
thing
about
you
is
that
you
do
not
know
how
to
do
anything
i
shall
have
to
teach
you
everything
for
four
or
five
months
you
will
be
of
no
use
to
me
and
besides
such
ugliness
is
not
prepossessing
that
gash
in
your
nose
have
you
received
a
blow
no
madame
it
has
always
been
there
well
it
is
not
very
attractive
what
pay
do
you
expect
thirty
francs
washing
and
wine
declared
louise
resolutely
the
old
woman
started
thirty
francs
have
you
never
then
looked
at
yourself
it
is
senseless
what
nobody
wants
you
nobody
will
ever
want
you
if
i
take
you
it
is
because
i
am
kind
it
is
because
i
really
pity
you
and
you
ask
me
thirty
francs
well
you
have
audacity
my
little
one
undoubtedly
your
comrades
have
been
giving
you
bad
advice
you
do
wrong
to
listen
to
them
surely
said
mme
approvingly
when
they
get
together
they
get
very
big
ideas
well
offered
the
old
lady
in
a
tone
of
conciliation
i
will
give
you
fifteen
francs
and
you
will
pay
for
your
wine
it
is
too
much
but
i
do
not
wish
to
take
advantage
of
your
ugliness
and
distress
she
softened
her
voice
became
almost
caressing
you
see
my
little
one
this
is
a
unique
opportunity
such
as
you
will
not
find
again
i
am
not
like
the
others
i
am
alone
i
have
no
family
i
have
no
one
my
servant
is
my
family
and
what
do
i
ask
of
my
servant
to
love
me
a
little
that
is
all
my
servant
lives
with
me
eats
with
me
apart
from
the
wine
oh
i
am
indulgent
to
her
and
then
when
i
die
for
i
am
very
old
and
often
sick
when
i
die
surely
i
shall
not
forget
the
girl
who
has
been
devoted
to
me
served
me
well
and
taken
care
of
me
you
are
ugly
very
ugly
too
ugly
well
i
shall
get
used
to
your
ugliness
to
your
face
there
are
some
pretty
women
who
are
very
and
who
rob
you
beyond
question
ugliness
is
sometimes
a
guarantee
of
morality
in
the
house
of
course
you
will
bring
no
men
to
my
house
you
see
i
know
how
to
do
you
justice
under
these
conditions
and
as
kind
as
i
am
what
i
offer
you
my
little
one
why
it
is
a
fortune
better
than
a
fortune
it
is
a
family
louise
was
shaken
certainly
the
old
lady
words
caused
unknown
hopes
to
sing
in
her
head
with
her
peasant
rapacity
she
had
visions
of
filled
with
gold
and
fabulous
wills
and
life
in
common
with
this
good
mistress
the
table
shared
frequent
trips
to
the
squares
and
the
suburban
woods
these
things
seemed
marvelous
to
her
and
they
frightened
her
also
for
doubts
an
unconquerable
and
native
mistrust
dimmed
the
brilliancy
of
these
promises
she
knew
not
what
to
say
or
do
she
knew
not
what
course
to
take
i
felt
a
desire
to
cry
out
to
her
do
not
accept
for
i
could
see
this
life
the
exhausting
tasks
the
bitter
reproaches
the
disputed
food
and
the
stripped
bones
and
spoiled
meat
thrown
to
her
hunger
and
the
eternal
patient
torturing
exploitation
of
a
poor
defenceless
being
no
do
not
listen
to
her
go
away
but
i
repressed
this
cry
which
was
on
my
lips
come
a
little
nearer
my
little
one
ordered
the
old
lady
one
would
think
that
you
were
afraid
of
me
come
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
come
nearer
how
curious
it
is
already
you
seem
less
ugly
already
i
am
getting
used
to
your
face
louise
approached
slowly
with
stiffened
members
trying
hard
not
to
run
against
the
chairs
and
furniture
endeavoring
to
walk
with
elegance
the
poor
creature
but
she
had
scarcely
placed
herself
beside
the
old
lady
when
the
latter
repulsed
her
with
a
grimace
my
god
she
cried
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
do
you
smell
so
bad
is
your
body
rotten
it
is
frightful
it
is
incredible
never
did
any
one
smell
as
you
smell
have
you
then
a
cancer
in
your
nose
or
perhaps
in
your
stomach
mme
made
a
noble
gesture
i
had
warned
you
madame
she
said
that
is
her
great
fault
it
is
that
which
keeps
her
from
finding
a
place
the
old
lady
continued
to
groan
my
god
my
god
is
it
possible
why
you
will
taint
the
whole
house
you
can
not
stay
near
me
this
changes
the
case
entirely
and
when
i
was
beginning
to
feel
sympathy
for
you
no
no
in
spite
of
all
my
kindness
it
is
not
possible
it
is
no
longer
possible
she
had
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
was
trying
to
dissipate
the
putrid
air
as
she
repeated
no
really
it
is
no
longer
possible
come
madame
intervened
mme
make
an
effort
i
am
sure
that
this
unhappy
girl
will
always
be
grateful
to
you
grateful
that
is
all
well
enough
but
gratitude
will
not
cure
her
of
this
frightful
infirmity
well
so
be
it
but
i
can
give
her
only
ten
francs
ten
francs
no
more
she
can
take
it
or
leave
it
louise
who
had
so
far
kept
back
her
tears
was
choking
no
i
will
not
i
will
not
i
will
not
listen
mademoiselle
said
mme
dryly
you
will
accept
this
place
if
you
do
i
will
not
undertake
to
get
another
for
you
you
can
go
and
ask
for
places
at
the
other
bureaus
i
have
had
enough
and
you
are
doing
injury
to
my
house
it
is
evident
insisted
the
old
lady
and
you
ought
to
thank
me
for
these
ten
francs
it
is
out
of
pity
out
of
charity
that
i
offer
them
to
you
how
is
it
that
you
do
not
see
that
i
am
doing
a
good
work
of
which
no
doubt
i
shall
repent
as
i
have
repented
of
others
then
addressing
mme
she
added
what
do
you
expect
i
am
so
constituted
i
can
not
bear
to
see
people
suffer
in
the
presence
of
misfortune
i
become
utterly
stupid
and
at
my
age
one
does
not
change
you
know
come
my
little
one
i
take
you
with
me
just
then
a
sudden
cramp
forced
me
to
descend
from
my
post
of
observation
i
never
saw
louise
again
the
next
day
but
one
mme
had
me
ceremoniously
ushered
into
the
bureau
and
after
having
examined
me
in
rather
an
embarrassing
fashion
she
said
to
me
mademoiselle
célestine
i
have
a
good
place
for
you
a
very
good
place
only
you
have
to
go
into
the
country
oh
not
very
far
into
the
country
i
do
not
go
there
you
know
she
insisted
you
do
not
know
the
country
there
are
excellent
places
in
the
country
oh
excellent
places
what
a
humbug
i
said
in
the
first
place
there
are
no
good
places
anywhere
mme
smiled
amiably
and
affectedly
never
had
i
seen
such
a
smile
on
her
face
i
beg
your
pardon
mademoiselle
célestine
there
are
no
bad
places
indeed
i
know
it
well
there
are
only
bad
masters
no
only
bad
servants
see
i
offer
you
all
the
best
houses
it
is
not
my
fault
if
you
do
not
stay
in
them
she
looked
at
me
in
a
way
that
was
almost
friendly
especially
as
you
are
very
intelligent
you
have
a
pretty
face
a
pretty
figure
charming
hands
not
at
all
ruined
by
work
and
eyes
that
are
not
in
your
pockets
good
fortune
might
easily
come
to
you
one
does
not
know
what
good
fortune
could
come
to
you
with
conduct
with
misconduct
you
mean
that
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
for
my
part
i
call
it
conduct
she
was
melting
little
by
little
her
mask
of
dignity
fell
i
was
now
confronted
simply
with
the
former
chambermaid
expert
at
all
rascalities
now
she
had
the
piggish
eye
the
fat
and
flabby
movements
the
sort
of
ritual
lapping
of
the
mouth
characteristic
of
the
procuress
and
which
i
had
observed
on
the
lips
of
madame
rebecca
ranvet
millinery
she
repeated
for
my
part
i
call
it
conduct
it
what
i
exclaimed
come
mademoiselle
you
are
not
a
beginner
and
you
are
acquainted
with
life
one
can
talk
with
you
it
is
a
question
of
a
single
gentleman
already
old
not
extremely
far
from
paris
and
very
rich
yes
in
fact
rich
enough
you
will
keep
his
house
something
like
a
governess
do
you
understand
such
places
are
very
delicate
much
in
demand
and
highly
profitable
this
one
offers
a
certain
future
for
a
woman
like
you
as
intelligent
as
you
are
as
pretty
as
you
are
especially
i
repeat
with
conduct
this
was
my
ambition
many
times
i
had
built
marvelous
futures
on
an
old
man
fancy
and
now
this
paradise
that
i
had
dreamed
of
was
before
me
smiling
calling
me
by
an
inexplicable
irony
of
life
by
an
imbecile
contradiction
the
cause
of
which
i
can
not
understand
i
squarely
refused
this
good
fortune
which
i
had
wished
for
so
many
times
and
which
at
last
presented
itself
an
old
rake
oh
no
besides
men
are
too
disgusting
to
me
the
old
the
young
all
of
them
for
a
few
seconds
mme
stood
in
amazement
she
had
not
expected
this
sally
resuming
her
severe
and
dignified
air
which
placed
so
great
a
distance
between
the
correct
that
she
wished
to
be
and
the
bohemian
girl
that
i
am
she
said
ah
mademoiselle
what
do
you
think
then
what
do
you
take
me
for
what
are
you
imagining
i
imagine
nothing
only
i
repeat
that
i
have
had
enough
of
men
do
you
really
know
of
whom
you
are
speaking
this
gentleman
mademoiselle
is
a
very
respectable
man
he
is
a
member
of
the
society
of
he
has
been
a
royalist
deputy
i
burst
out
laughing
yes
yes
of
course
i
know
your
and
all
the
devil
saints
and
all
the
deputies
no
thank
you
then
suddenly
without
transition
i
asked
just
what
is
your
old
man
to
be
sure
one
more
or
less
will
make
no
difference
it
is
not
a
matter
of
great
consequence
after
all
but
mme
did
not
unbend
she
declared
in
a
firm
voice
it
is
useless
mademoiselle
you
are
not
the
serious
woman
the
trusty
person
that
this
gentleman
needs
i
thought
you
were
more
suitable
with
you
one
can
not
be
sure
of
anything
i
insisted
a
long
time
but
she
was
inflexible
and
i
went
back
to
the
in
a
very
uncertain
state
of
mind
oh
that
so
sad
and
dark
always
the
same
these
girls
sprawling
and
crushed
upon
the
benches
this
market
for
human
meat
to
tempt
voracity
this
flux
of
filth
and
this
reflux
of
poverty
that
bring
you
back
there
mournful
waifs
wreckage
from
the
sea
eternally
tossed
hither
and
thither
what
a
queer
type
i
am
thought
i
i
desire
things
things
things
when
i
think
them
unrealizable
and
so
soon
as
they
promise
realization
so
soon
as
they
present
themselves
to
me
in
clearer
outline
i
no
longer
want
them
there
was
something
of
this
certainly
in
my
refusal
but
there
was
also
a
childish
desire
to
humiliate
mme
a
little
and
to
take
a
sort
of
vengeance
upon
her
by
catching
the
contemptuous
and
haughty
creature
in
the
very
act
of
catering
to
lust
i
regretted
this
old
man
who
now
exercised
over
me
all
the
seductions
of
the
unknown
all
the
charms
of
an
inaccessible
ideal
and
i
found
pleasure
in
picturing
him
to
my
fancy
a
spruce
old
man
with
soft
hands
a
pretty
smile
a
pink
and
shaven
face
and
gay
and
generous
and
not
so
much
a
maniac
as
rabour
allowing
himself
to
be
led
by
me
like
a
little
dog
come
here
come
come
here
and
he
came
caressing
frisking
about
with
a
kind
and
submissive
look
now
sit
up
and
he
sat
up
in
such
a
funny
way
with
his
forepaws
beating
the
air
oh
the
good
i
gave
him
sugar
i
stroked
his
silky
skin
he
no
longer
disgusted
me
and
again
i
reflected
how
stupid
i
am
all
the
same
a
good
doggy
a
fine
garden
a
fine
house
money
tranquillity
an
assured
future
to
think
that
i
have
refused
all
these
and
without
knowing
why
and
never
to
know
what
i
want
and
never
to
will
what
i
desire
at
bottom
i
am
afraid
of
man
worse
than
that
i
have
a
disgust
for
man
when
he
is
far
away
when
he
is
near
me
i
am
capable
of
anything
i
have
no
power
of
resistance
save
against
things
that
are
not
to
happen
and
men
whom
i
shall
never
know
i
really
believe
that
i
shall
never
be
happy
the
was
oppressive
to
me
this
obscurity
this
dim
light
these
sprawling
creatures
made
my
ideas
more
and
more
lugubrious
something
heavy
and
irremediable
hovered
over
me
without
waiting
for
the
bureau
to
close
i
went
away
with
heavy
heart
and
choking
throat
on
the
stairs
i
met
louis
clinging
to
the
banister
he
was
ascending
the
steps
slowly
and
painfully
we
looked
at
each
other
for
a
second
he
did
not
say
anything
and
i
too
found
no
word
but
our
looks
said
all
ah
he
as
well
as
i
was
not
happy
i
listened
to
him
a
moment
as
he
went
up
the
steps
then
i
plunged
down
the
stairway
poor
little
wretch
in
the
street
i
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
stunned
i
looked
about
for
love
for
the
round
back
and
black
costume
of
mme
rebecca
ranvet
millinery
ah
if
i
had
seen
her
i
would
have
gone
to
her
i
would
have
delivered
myself
to
her
but
there
was
no
such
person
there
the
people
passing
were
busy
and
indifferent
and
paid
no
attention
to
my
distress
then
i
stopped
at
a
where
i
bought
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
after
strolling
about
for
a
while
still
stupid
and
with
heavy
head
i
went
back
to
my
hotel
toward
evening
late
i
heard
a
knock
at
my
door
i
lay
stretched
upon
my
bed
half
naked
stupefied
by
drink
who
is
there
i
cried
it
is
i
who
are
you
the
waiter
i
rose
with
my
loosened
hair
falling
from
my
shoulders
and
opened
the
door
what
do
you
want
the
waiter
smiled
he
was
a
tall
fellow
with
red
hair
whom
i
had
met
several
times
on
the
stairs
and
who
always
looked
at
me
strangely
what
do
you
want
i
repeated
the
waiter
smiled
again
apparently
embarrassed
and
rolling
in
his
fat
fingers
the
bottom
of
his
blue
apron
covered
with
grease
spots
he
stammered
i
he
surveyed
my
person
with
a
sort
of
dismal
desire
well
come
in
you
brute
i
cried
suddenly
and
pushing
him
into
my
room
i
closed
the
door
again
violently
oh
misery
me
the
waiter
was
discharged
i
never
knew
his
name
i
should
not
like
to
leave
the
subject
of
mme
without
giving
my
recollection
of
a
poor
devil
whom
i
met
there
he
was
a
gardener
who
had
been
a
widower
for
four
months
and
who
was
looking
for
a
place
among
the
many
lamentable
faces
that
passed
through
the
bureau
i
saw
none
as
sad
as
his
none
that
seemed
to
me
more
overwhelmed
by
life
his
wife
had
died
of
a
miscarriage
of
a
miscarriage
the
night
before
the
day
when
after
two
months
of
poverty
they
were
at
last
to
take
positions
on
an
estate
he
in
charge
of
the
garden
she
in
charge
of
the
whether
from
or
from
weariness
and
from
disgust
of
life
he
had
found
nothing
since
this
great
misfortune
he
had
not
even
looked
for
anything
and
during
this
period
of
idleness
his
little
savings
had
quickly
melted
away
although
he
was
very
suspicious
i
succeeded
in
taming
him
a
little
i
put
into
the
form
of
an
impersonal
narrative
the
simple
and
poignant
tragedy
that
he
related
to
me
one
day
when
i
greatly
moved
by
his
misfortune
had
shown
more
interest
and
pity
than
usual
here
it
is
when
they
had
examined
the
gardens
the
terraces
the
conservatories
and
the
gardener
house
at
the
park
entrance
sumptuously
clothed
with
ivies
climbing
plants
and
wild
vines
they
came
back
slowly
without
speaking
to
each
other
their
souls
in
anguish
and
suspense
toward
the
lawn
where
the
countess
was
following
with
a
loving
gaze
her
three
children
who
with
their
light
hair
their
bright
trinkets
and
their
pink
and
prosperous
flesh
were
playing
in
the
grass
under
the
care
of
the
governess
at
a
distance
of
twenty
steps
they
halted
respectfully
the
man
with
uncovered
head
and
holding
his
cap
in
his
hand
the
woman
timid
under
her
black
straw
hat
embarrassed
in
her
dark
woollen
sack
and
twisting
the
chain
of
a
little
leather
bag
to
give
herself
confidence
the
undulating
greensward
of
the
park
rolled
away
in
the
distance
between
thick
clusters
of
trees
come
nearer
said
the
countess
in
a
voice
of
kind
encouragement
the
man
had
a
brown
face
skin
tanned
by
the
sun
large
knotty
hands
of
the
color
of
earth
the
tips
of
the
fingers
deformed
and
polished
by
the
continual
handling
of
tools
the
woman
was
a
little
pale
with
a
gray
pallor
underlying
the
freckles
that
besprinkled
her
face
a
little
awkward
too
and
very
clean
she
did
not
dare
to
lift
her
eyes
to
this
fine
lady
who
was
about
to
examine
her
inconsiderately
overwhelm
her
with
torturing
questions
and
turn
her
inside
out
body
and
soul
as
others
had
done
before
and
she
looked
intently
at
the
pretty
picture
of
the
three
babies
playing
in
the
grass
already
showing
manners
well
under
control
and
studied
graces
they
advanced
a
few
steps
slowly
and
both
of
them
with
a
mechanical
and
simultaneous
movement
folded
their
hands
over
their
stomachs
well
asked
the
countess
you
have
seen
everything
madame
the
countess
is
very
good
answered
the
man
it
is
very
grand
and
very
beautiful
oh
it
is
a
superb
estate
there
must
be
plenty
of
work
indeed
and
i
am
very
exacting
i
warn
you
very
just
but
very
exacting
i
love
to
have
everything
perfectly
kept
and
flowers
flowers
flowers
always
and
everywhere
however
you
have
two
assistants
in
summer
and
one
in
winter
that
is
sufficient
oh
replied
the
man
the
work
does
not
worry
me
the
more
there
is
the
better
i
like
it
i
love
my
calling
and
i
know
it
thoroughly
trees
early
vegetables
mosaics
and
everything
as
for
flowers
with
good
arms
taste
water
good
straw
coverings
and
saving
your
presence
madame
the
countess
an
abundance
of
manure
one
can
have
as
many
as
one
wants
after
a
pause
he
continued
my
wife
too
is
very
active
very
skilful
and
a
good
manager
she
does
not
look
strong
but
she
is
courageous
and
never
sick
and
nobody
understands
animals
as
she
does
in
the
place
where
we
last
worked
there
were
three
cows
and
two
hundred
hens
the
countess
nodded
approvingly
how
do
you
like
your
lodge
the
lodge
too
is
very
fine
it
is
almost
too
grand
for
little
people
like
us
and
we
have
not
enough
furniture
for
it
but
one
need
not
occupy
the
whole
of
it
and
besides
it
is
far
from
the
château
and
it
ought
to
be
masters
do
not
like
to
have
the
gardeners
too
near
them
and
we
on
the
other
hand
are
afraid
of
being
embarrassed
here
each
is
by
himself
that
is
better
for
all
only
the
man
hesitated
seized
with
a
sudden
timidity
in
view
of
what
he
had
to
say
only
what
asked
the
countess
after
a
silence
that
increased
the
man
embarrassment
the
latter
gripped
his
cap
more
tightly
turned
it
in
his
fat
fingers
rested
more
heavily
on
the
ground
and
making
a
bold
plunge
exclaimed
well
it
is
this
i
wanted
to
say
to
madame
the
countess
that
the
wages
do
not
correspond
with
the
place
they
are
too
low
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
ends
meet
madame
the
countess
ought
to
give
a
little
more
you
forget
my
friend
that
you
are
lodged
heated
lighted
that
you
have
vegetables
and
fruits
that
i
give
a
dozen
eggs
a
week
and
a
quart
of
milk
a
day
it
is
enormous
ah
madame
the
countess
gives
milk
and
eggs
and
she
furnishes
light
and
he
looked
at
his
wife
as
if
to
ask
her
advice
at
the
same
time
murmuring
indeed
that
is
something
one
can
not
deny
it
that
is
not
bad
the
woman
stammered
surely
that
helps
out
a
little
then
trembling
and
embarrassed
madame
the
countess
no
doubt
gives
presents
also
in
the
month
of
january
and
on
saint
fiacre
day
no
nothing
it
is
the
custom
however
it
is
not
mine
in
his
turn
the
man
asked
and
for
the
weasels
and
no
nothing
for
those
either
you
can
have
the
skins
this
was
said
in
a
dry
decisive
tone
that
forbade
further
discussion
and
suddenly
ah
i
warn
you
once
for
all
that
i
forbid
the
gardener
to
sell
or
give
vegetables
to
any
one
whomsoever
i
know
very
well
that
it
is
necessary
to
raise
too
many
in
order
to
have
enough
and
that
of
them
are
wasted
so
much
the
worse
i
intend
to
allow
them
to
be
wasted
of
course
the
same
as
everywhere
else
so
it
is
agreed
how
long
have
you
been
married
six
years
answered
the
woman
you
have
no
children
we
had
a
little
girl
she
is
dead
ah
that
is
well
that
is
very
well
approved
the
countess
in
an
indifferent
tone
but
you
are
both
young
you
may
have
others
yet
they
are
hardly
to
be
desired
madame
the
countess
but
they
are
more
easily
obtained
than
an
income
of
three
hundred
francs
the
countess
eyes
took
on
a
severe
expression
i
must
further
warn
you
that
i
will
have
no
children
on
the
premises
absolutely
none
if
you
were
to
have
another
child
i
should
be
obliged
to
discharge
you
at
once
oh
no
children
they
cry
they
are
in
the
way
they
ruin
everything
they
frighten
the
horses
and
spread
diseases
no
no
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
i
tolerate
a
child
on
my
premises
so
you
are
warned
govern
yourselves
accordingly
take
your
precautions
just
then
one
of
the
children
who
had
fallen
came
crying
to
take
refuge
in
his
mother
gown
she
took
him
in
her
arms
lulled
him
with
soothing
words
caressed
him
kissed
him
tenderly
and
sent
him
back
to
rejoin
the
two
others
pacified
and
smiling
the
woman
suddenly
felt
her
heart
growing
heavy
she
thought
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
keep
back
her
tears
joy
tenderness
love
motherhood
then
were
for
the
rich
only
the
children
had
begun
to
play
again
on
the
lawn
she
hated
them
with
a
savage
hatred
she
felt
a
desire
to
insult
them
to
beat
them
to
kill
them
to
insult
and
kill
also
this
insolent
and
cruel
woman
this
egoistic
mother
who
had
just
uttered
abominable
words
words
that
condemned
not
to
be
born
the
future
humanity
that
lay
sleeping
in
her
womb
but
she
restrained
herself
and
said
simply
in
response
to
a
new
warning
more
imperative
than
the
other
we
will
be
careful
madame
the
countess
we
will
try
that
right
for
i
can
not
too
often
repeat
it
to
you
this
is
a
principle
here
a
principle
upon
which
i
can
not
compromise
and
she
added
with
an
inflection
in
her
voice
that
was
almost
caressing
moreover
believe
me
when
one
is
not
rich
it
is
better
to
have
no
children
the
man
to
please
his
future
mistress
said
by
way
of
conclusion
surely
surely
madame
the
countess
speaks
truly
but
there
was
hatred
within
him
the
sombre
and
fierce
gleam
that
passed
over
his
eyes
like
a
flash
gave
the
lie
to
the
forced
servility
of
these
last
words
the
countess
did
not
see
this
murderous
gleam
for
she
had
fixed
her
eyes
instinctively
on
the
person
of
the
woman
whom
she
had
just
condemned
to
sterility
or
infanticide
the
bargain
was
quickly
concluded
she
gave
her
orders
detailed
minutely
the
services
that
she
expected
of
her
new
gardeners
and
as
she
dismissed
them
with
a
haughty
smile
she
said
in
a
tone
that
admitted
of
no
reply
i
think
that
you
have
religious
sentiments
do
you
not
here
everybody
goes
to
mass
on
sunday
and
receives
the
sacrament
at
easter
i
insist
upon
it
absolutely
they
went
away
without
speaking
to
each
other
very
serious
very
sober
the
road
was
dusty
and
the
heat
oppressive
and
the
poor
woman
walked
painfully
dragging
her
legs
after
her
as
she
was
stifling
a
little
she
stopped
placed
her
bag
upon
the
ground
and
unlaced
her
corsets
ouf
she
exclaimed
taking
in
deep
breaths
of
air
and
her
figure
which
had
been
long
compressed
now
swelled
out
revealing
the
characteristic
roundness
the
stain
of
motherhood
the
crime
they
continued
on
their
way
a
few
steps
further
on
they
entered
an
inn
by
the
roadside
and
ordered
a
quart
of
wine
why
did
you
say
i
was
pregnant
asked
the
woman
the
man
answered
what
that
she
might
show
us
the
door
as
the
three
others
have
done
or
makes
but
little
difference
then
the
man
murmured
between
his
teeth
if
you
were
a
woman
well
you
would
go
this
very
evening
to
mother
hurlot
she
has
herbs
but
the
woman
began
to
weep
and
in
her
tears
she
groaned
do
say
that
do
say
that
that
brings
bad
luck
the
man
pounded
the
table
and
cried
must
we
then
die
my
god
the
bad
luck
came
four
days
later
the
woman
had
a
miscarriage
a
miscarriage
and
died
in
the
frightful
pains
of
peritonitis
and
when
the
man
had
finished
his
story
he
said
to
me
so
now
here
i
am
all
alone
no
wife
no
child
nothing
i
really
thought
of
revenging
myself
yes
for
a
long
time
i
thought
of
killing
those
three
children
that
were
playing
on
the
lawn
although
i
am
not
wicked
i
assure
you
but
that
woman
three
children
i
swear
to
you
i
could
have
strangled
with
joy
with
real
joy
oh
yes
but
then
i
did
not
dare
what
do
you
expect
we
are
afraid
we
are
cowards
we
have
courage
only
to
suffer
xvi
no
letter
from
joseph
knowing
how
prudent
he
is
i
am
not
greatly
astonished
at
his
silence
but
it
causes
me
a
little
suffering
to
be
sure
joseph
is
not
unaware
that
the
letters
go
through
madame
hands
before
reaching
ours
and
doubtless
he
does
not
wish
to
expose
himself
or
me
to
the
danger
of
their
being
read
by
her
or
even
have
the
fact
that
he
writes
to
me
made
a
subject
of
madame
malicious
comments
yet
with
his
great
mental
resources
it
seems
to
me
that
he
could
have
found
a
way
of
sending
me
news
he
is
to
return
morning
will
he
return
i
am
not
without
anxiety
and
can
not
keep
from
thinking
about
it
why
too
was
he
unwilling
to
give
me
his
cherbourg
address
but
i
do
not
wish
to
think
of
all
these
things
that
split
my
head
and
put
me
into
a
fever
here
everything
goes
on
in
the
same
way
except
that
there
are
fewer
events
and
still
greater
silence
joseph
work
is
done
by
the
sacristan
out
of
friendship
he
comes
every
day
punctually
to
groom
the
horses
and
to
tend
to
the
impossible
to
get
a
single
word
out
of
him
he
is
more
silent
and
suspicious
than
joseph
and
his
manners
are
more
doubtful
he
is
more
ordinary
too
and
lacks
his
greatness
and
power
i
see
him
only
when
i
have
an
order
to
deliver
to
him
he
is
a
queer
type
too
the
grocer
tells
me
that
when
young
he
studied
for
the
priesthood
and
was
expelled
from
the
seminary
on
account
of
his
indelicacy
and
immorality
may
it
not
have
been
he
who
outraged
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
since
then
he
has
tried
his
hand
at
all
trades
now
a
now
a
now
a
peddler
a
notary
clerk
a
domestic
the
town
drummer
an
auctioneer
and
an
employee
in
the
sheriff
office
for
the
last
four
years
he
has
been
sacristan
to
be
sacristan
is
to
be
also
something
of
a
priest
moreover
he
has
all
the
slimy
and
crawling
manners
of
the
ecclesiastical
bugs
surely
he
would
not
recoil
from
the
vilest
tasks
joseph
does
wrong
to
make
him
his
friend
but
is
he
his
friend
is
he
not
rather
his
accomplice
madame
has
a
sick
headache
it
seems
she
has
one
regularly
every
three
months
for
two
days
she
remains
shut
up
in
her
room
with
drawn
curtains
and
without
light
only
marianne
being
allowed
to
enter
she
does
not
want
me
madame
sickness
means
a
good
time
for
monsieur
monsieur
makes
the
most
of
it
he
does
not
leave
the
kitchen
captain
mauger
who
does
not
speak
to
me
any
more
but
casts
furious
glances
at
me
over
the
hedge
has
become
reconciled
with
his
family
at
least
with
one
of
his
nieces
who
has
come
to
live
with
him
she
is
not
a
tall
blonde
with
a
nose
that
is
too
long
but
with
a
fresh
complexion
and
a
good
figure
people
say
she
is
to
keep
the
house
and
take
rose
place
as
for
mme
gouin
rose
death
must
have
been
a
blow
to
her
sunday
mornings
she
saw
at
once
that
she
could
not
get
along
without
a
leading
lady
now
it
is
that
pest
of
a
haberdasher
who
leads
off
in
the
gossip
and
undertakes
to
maintain
the
admiration
of
the
girls
of
for
the
clandestine
talents
of
this
infamous
grocer
yesterday
being
sunday
i
went
to
the
it
was
a
very
brilliant
occasion
they
were
all
there
there
was
very
little
said
about
rose
and
when
i
told
the
story
of
the
wills
there
was
a
general
shout
of
laughter
ah
the
captain
was
right
when
he
said
to
me
everything
can
be
replaced
but
the
haberdasher
has
not
authority
for
she
is
a
woman
concerning
whom
from
the
point
of
view
of
morals
there
unhappily
is
nothing
to
be
said
in
what
a
hurry
i
am
to
see
joseph
with
what
nervous
impatience
i
await
the
moment
when
i
shall
know
what
i
must
hope
or
fear
from
destiny
i
can
no
longer
live
as
i
am
living
now
never
have
i
been
so
distressed
by
this
mediocre
life
that
i
live
by
these
people
whom
i
serve
by
all
these
dismal
mountebanks
around
me
among
whom
i
am
growing
more
stupid
from
day
to
day
if
i
were
not
sustained
by
the
strange
feeling
that
gives
a
new
and
powerful
interest
to
my
present
life
i
think
it
would
not
be
long
before
i
too
should
plunge
into
the
abyss
of
stupidity
and
vileness
which
i
see
continually
widening
around
me
ah
whether
joseph
succeeds
or
not
whether
he
changes
his
mind
about
me
or
not
i
have
come
to
a
final
decision
i
will
no
longer
stay
here
a
few
hours
more
another
whole
night
of
anxiety
and
then
i
shall
be
settled
regarding
my
future
i
am
going
to
spend
this
night
in
a
further
revival
of
old
memories
perhaps
for
the
last
time
it
is
the
only
way
that
i
have
of
avoiding
the
anxieties
of
the
present
and
not
splitting
my
head
over
the
dreams
of
in
reality
these
recollections
amuse
me
and
deepen
my
contempt
what
singular
and
monotonous
faces
all
the
same
i
have
met
on
my
path
of
servitude
when
i
see
them
again
in
my
mind
eye
they
do
not
make
on
me
the
impression
of
really
living
beings
they
live
or
at
least
give
the
illusion
of
life
only
through
their
vices
take
away
the
vices
that
sustain
them
as
bandages
sustain
mummies
and
they
are
no
longer
even
phantoms
they
are
nothing
but
dust
ashes
death
oh
that
was
a
famous
house
for
instance
to
which
a
few
days
after
my
refusal
to
go
into
the
service
of
the
old
gentleman
in
the
country
i
was
sent
with
all
sorts
of
admirable
references
by
mme
my
masters
were
a
very
young
couple
without
animals
or
children
living
in
an
interior
though
the
furniture
was
stylish
and
there
was
a
heavy
elegance
about
the
decorations
luxury
and
great
waste
a
single
glance
as
i
entered
showed
me
all
i
saw
clearly
with
whom
i
had
to
deal
it
was
my
dream
now
then
i
was
going
to
forget
all
my
miseries
xavier
and
the
good
sisters
of
neuilly
and
the
killing
sessions
in
the
of
the
and
the
long
days
of
anguish
and
the
long
nights
of
solitude
and
debauchery
now
then
i
was
going
to
plan
for
myself
an
agreeable
life
with
easy
work
and
certain
profits
made
happy
by
this
prospect
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
correct
my
caprices
repress
the
ardent
impulses
of
my
frankness
in
order
to
stay
in
this
place
a
long
long
time
in
a
twinkling
my
gloomy
ideas
vanished
and
my
hatred
of
the
flew
away
as
if
by
enchantment
i
again
became
madly
and
hilariously
gay
and
seized
anew
with
a
violent
love
of
life
i
began
to
think
that
the
masters
are
sometimes
good
the
personnel
was
not
numerous
but
it
was
select
a
cook
a
de
an
old
butler
and
myself
there
was
no
coachman
the
masters
having
abolished
their
stable
a
short
time
before
preferring
to
hire
their
teams
from
a
we
became
friends
directly
that
very
evening
they
gave
me
welcome
by
opening
a
bottle
of
champagne
my
i
exclaimed
clapping
my
hands
they
do
things
well
here
the
de
smiled
and
shook
a
bunch
of
keys
musically
in
the
air
he
had
the
keys
to
the
cellar
he
had
all
the
keys
he
was
the
trusted
servant
of
the
house
say
will
you
lend
them
to
me
i
asked
by
way
of
a
joke
giving
me
a
tender
look
he
answered
yes
if
you
are
nice
with
baby
you
will
have
to
be
nice
with
baby
oh
he
was
a
man
and
he
knew
how
to
talk
to
women
he
had
an
english
name
william
what
a
pretty
name
during
the
meal
which
lasted
for
some
time
the
old
butler
did
not
say
a
word
but
ate
and
drank
a
great
deal
they
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
he
seemed
a
little
dopy
as
for
william
he
was
charming
gallant
and
assiduous
he
paid
me
delicate
attentions
under
the
table
and
when
we
were
drinking
our
coffee
he
offered
me
russian
cigarettes
of
which
his
pockets
were
full
then
drawing
me
to
him
the
tobacco
had
made
me
a
little
dizzy
and
i
was
a
little
drunk
too
and
my
hair
was
disarranged
he
seated
me
upon
his
knees
and
whispered
audacious
things
in
my
ear
oh
but
he
was
bold
eugénie
the
cook
did
not
seem
scandalized
by
these
remarks
and
these
performances
anxious
and
dreamy
she
kept
her
neck
continually
inclined
toward
the
door
pricked
up
her
ears
at
the
slightest
sound
as
if
she
were
expecting
some
one
and
with
a
very
uncertain
eye
kept
on
guzzling
wine
glass
after
glass
she
was
a
woman
of
about
with
a
large
bust
fleshy
sensual
lips
languishing
and
passionate
eyes
and
an
air
of
great
kindness
mingled
with
melancholy
at
last
there
came
a
discreet
knock
at
the
door
eugénie
face
lighted
up
she
rose
with
a
bound
and
went
to
open
the
door
not
being
familiar
with
the
habits
of
this
servants
hall
i
wanted
to
assume
a
more
decorous
attitude
but
william
held
me
more
tightly
than
before
pressing
me
close
against
him
with
a
firm
embrace
that
nothing
he
remarked
quietly
that
is
the
little
one
meantime
a
young
man
had
entered
almost
a
child
very
slender
very
blonde
with
a
very
white
skin
underlying
the
dark
beginnings
of
a
beard
scarcely
eighteen
he
was
as
pretty
as
a
love
he
wore
an
entirely
new
and
elegant
jacket
which
set
off
his
trim
and
slender
bust
and
a
pink
cravat
he
was
the
son
of
the
janitor
in
the
next
house
he
came
it
seems
every
evening
eugénie
adored
him
was
mad
over
him
every
day
she
put
aside
in
a
big
basket
tureens
full
of
fine
slices
of
meat
bottles
of
wine
cakes
and
delicious
fruits
which
the
little
one
carried
to
his
parents
why
are
you
so
late
asked
eugénie
the
little
one
excused
himself
in
a
drawling
voice
i
had
to
look
out
for
the
lodge
mamma
had
gone
on
an
errand
your
mother
your
mother
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
young
scamp
she
sighed
and
with
her
eyes
gazing
into
the
child
eyes
and
her
two
hands
resting
on
his
shoulders
she
continued
in
a
mournful
tone
when
you
are
late
i
am
always
afraid
something
has
happened
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
late
my
darling
you
will
say
to
your
mother
that
if
that
continues
well
i
will
give
you
nothing
more
for
her
then
with
quivering
nostrils
and
her
whole
body
shaken
by
a
thrill
she
said
how
pretty
you
are
my
love
oh
your
little
phiz
your
little
phiz
why
did
you
not
wear
your
pretty
yellow
shoes
i
want
you
to
look
your
best
when
you
come
to
see
me
and
those
eyes
those
big
eyes
you
little
brigand
ah
i
bet
they
have
been
looking
at
another
woman
and
your
lips
your
lips
what
have
those
lips
been
doing
he
smilingly
reassured
her
with
a
slightly
swaying
motion
of
his
body
no
indeed
i
assure
you
nini
that
straight
mamma
had
gone
on
an
errand
yes
truly
eugénie
repeated
several
times
oh
you
scamp
you
scamp
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
looking
at
other
women
your
little
phiz
for
me
your
little
mouth
for
me
your
big
eyes
for
me
say
do
you
really
love
me
oh
yes
surely
say
it
again
oh
surely
she
leaped
upon
his
neck
and
panting
led
him
into
the
adjoining
room
stammering
words
of
love
william
said
to
me
how
she
holds
him
and
what
a
pile
this
little
chap
costs
her
last
week
she
gave
him
a
complete
new
outfit
you
would
not
love
me
like
that
this
scene
had
stirred
me
deeply
and
i
promptly
vowed
a
friendship
for
the
poor
eugénie
this
boy
resembled
xavier
at
least
there
was
a
moral
similarity
between
these
two
beings
so
pretty
though
so
rotten
and
this
reminder
made
me
sad
oh
infinitely
sad
i
saw
myself
again
in
xavier
room
the
night
when
i
gave
him
the
ninety
francs
oh
your
little
phiz
your
little
mouth
your
big
eyes
they
were
the
same
cold
and
cruel
eyes
there
was
the
same
undulation
of
the
body
there
was
the
same
vice
shining
in
the
pupils
and
imparting
a
sort
of
benumbing
poison
to
the
lips
i
released
myself
from
william
arms
and
as
i
was
arranging
my
disordered
hair
i
remarked
well
i
must
say
you
do
lose
any
time
of
course
i
did
not
want
to
change
anything
in
the
habits
of
the
house
or
in
the
service
william
did
the
housework
in
a
fashion
a
stroke
of
the
broom
here
a
stroke
of
the
duster
there
and
the
thing
was
done
the
rest
of
the
time
he
babbled
ransacked
drawers
and
closets
and
read
the
letters
that
were
dragging
about
on
every
hand
and
in
every
corner
i
did
as
he
did
i
allowed
the
dust
to
accumulate
upon
and
under
the
furniture
and
i
took
good
care
not
to
disturb
the
disorder
of
the
and
the
chambers
if
i
had
been
in
the
masters
place
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
live
in
so
untidy
an
interior
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
command
and
being
timid
and
fearing
scenes
they
never
dared
to
say
anything
if
sometimes
after
an
omission
that
was
too
patent
or
too
embarrassing
they
ventured
to
stammer
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
not
done
this
or
that
we
had
only
to
answer
in
a
tone
whose
firmness
did
not
exclude
insolence
i
really
ask
madame
pardon
madame
is
mistaken
and
if
madame
is
not
content
then
they
insisted
no
further
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
never
in
my
life
have
i
met
masters
having
less
authority
over
their
servants
or
such
ninnies
really
one
is
not
to
be
led
by
the
nose
as
they
were
it
is
necessary
to
do
william
this
justice
that
he
had
known
how
to
put
things
on
a
good
footing
in
the
box
william
had
a
passion
that
is
common
among
servants
the
passion
for
the
races
he
knew
all
the
jockeys
all
the
trainers
all
the
bookmakers
and
also
some
very
sporty
gentlemen
barons
and
viscounts
who
showed
a
certain
friendship
for
him
knowing
that
he
had
astonishing
tips
from
time
to
time
this
passion
whose
maintenance
and
satisfaction
require
numerous
suburban
excursions
does
not
harmonize
with
a
restricted
and
sedentary
calling
like
that
of
a
de
now
william
had
regulated
his
life
in
this
way
after
breakfast
he
dressed
and
went
out
how
he
was
in
his
black
and
white
check
pantaloons
his
shoes
his
overcoat
and
his
hats
oh
william
hats
hats
the
color
of
deep
water
in
which
skies
trees
streets
rivers
crowds
hippodromes
succeeded
one
another
in
prodigious
reflections
he
came
back
just
in
time
to
dress
his
master
and
often
in
the
evening
after
dinner
he
went
out
again
saying
that
he
had
an
important
rendezvous
with
the
english
i
did
not
see
him
again
until
very
late
at
night
when
he
always
came
home
a
little
drunk
from
having
taken
too
many
cocktails
every
week
he
invited
friends
to
dinner
coachmen
de
people
these
latter
very
comical
and
weird
with
their
twisted
legs
their
deformed
knees
and
their
appearance
of
crapulous
cynicism
and
ambiguous
sex
they
talked
horses
turf
women
told
all
sorts
of
disagreeable
stories
about
the
morals
of
their
masters
and
then
becoming
excited
by
the
fumes
of
the
wine
began
on
politics
william
was
a
superbly
uncompromising
and
terribly
violent
reactionary
the
man
for
me
he
cried
is
cassagnac
a
rude
lad
cassagnac
they
are
afraid
of
him
how
he
can
write
what
raps
he
gives
yes
let
the
dirty
rascals
tackle
this
strenuous
chap
if
they
dare
and
suddenly
at
the
height
of
the
noise
eugénie
rose
paler
and
with
shining
eyes
and
rushed
for
the
door
the
little
one
entered
his
face
wearing
an
expression
of
astonishment
at
sight
of
these
unusual
people
of
these
empty
bottles
of
this
reckless
pillage
of
the
table
eugénie
had
saved
a
glass
of
champagne
and
a
plate
of
goodies
for
him
then
they
both
disappeared
into
the
adjoining
room
oh
your
little
phiz
your
little
mouth
your
big
eyes
that
night
the
parents
basket
contained
larger
and
better
portions
of
course
these
worthy
people
should
profit
by
the
feast
william
often
spoke
to
me
of
edgar
the
celebrated
of
the
baron
de
borgsheim
he
was
proud
to
know
him
he
admired
him
almost
as
much
as
he
admired
cassagnac
edgar
and
cassagnac
were
the
two
great
enthusiasms
of
his
life
i
think
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
joke
him
about
them
or
even
to
discuss
them
with
him
when
he
came
home
at
night
late
william
excused
himself
by
saying
to
me
i
was
with
edgar
it
seemed
that
to
be
with
edgar
constituted
not
only
an
excuse
but
a
glory
why
do
you
bring
your
famous
edgar
to
dinner
that
i
may
see
him
i
asked
of
him
one
day
william
was
scandalized
at
this
idea
and
he
declared
loftily
what
do
you
imagine
that
edgar
would
dine
with
simple
servants
it
was
from
edgar
that
william
got
his
incomparable
method
of
polishing
his
hats
once
at
the
auteuil
races
edgar
was
approached
by
the
young
marquis
de
plérin
say
my
lad
begged
the
marquis
how
do
you
get
your
hats
my
hats
monsieur
the
marquis
responded
edgar
highly
flattered
for
the
young
plérin
a
robber
at
the
races
and
a
trickster
at
the
was
then
one
of
the
most
famous
personalities
of
parisian
society
it
is
very
simple
only
it
is
like
picking
the
winner
you
must
know
how
well
this
is
the
trick
every
morning
i
make
my
de
run
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
sweats
of
course
and
the
sweat
contains
oil
then
with
a
very
fine
silk
handkerchief
he
wipes
the
sweat
from
his
brow
and
rubs
my
hats
with
it
a
stroke
or
two
with
the
iron
finishes
the
job
but
it
takes
a
clean
and
healthy
man
preferably
a
man
with
complexion
for
some
blondes
smell
strong
and
all
sweats
are
not
suitable
last
year
i
gave
the
receipt
to
the
prince
of
wales
and
as
the
young
marquis
de
plérin
thanked
edgar
and
slyly
shook
his
hand
the
latter
added
confidently
take
baladeur
at
seven
to
one
he
is
to
be
the
winner
monsieur
the
marquis
it
is
really
funny
when
i
think
of
it
but
i
finally
came
to
feel
flattered
myself
that
william
had
such
a
relation
to
me
too
edgar
was
something
admirable
and
inaccessible
like
the
emperor
of
germany
victor
hugo
or
paul
bourget
that
is
why
i
think
it
advisable
to
fix
in
these
pages
from
all
that
william
told
me
the
portrait
of
this
more
than
illustrious
this
historic
personage
edgar
was
born
in
london
in
a
frightful
den
between
two
hiccups
of
whiskey
as
a
boy
he
was
a
vagabond
a
beggar
a
thief
and
a
later
having
the
requisite
physical
deformities
and
the
most
crapulous
instincts
he
was
pitched
on
for
a
groom
from
to
stable
rubbing
against
all
the
trickery
all
the
rapacity
all
the
vice
prevailing
among
the
servants
of
a
grand
establishment
he
became
a
lad
in
the
eaton
stud
and
he
strutted
about
in
a
scotch
cap
a
yellow
and
black
striped
waistcoat
and
light
pantaloons
loose
at
the
thighs
tight
at
the
calves
and
wrinkled
at
the
knees
in
the
form
of
a
screw
when
scarcely
an
adult
he
looked
like
a
little
old
man
with
frail
limbs
and
furrowed
face
red
at
the
yellow
at
the
temples
with
and
grimacing
mouth
with
thin
hair
brushed
over
his
ears
in
the
form
of
a
greasy
spiral
in
a
society
which
the
odor
of
causes
to
swoon
with
delight
edgar
was
already
a
personage
less
anonymous
than
a
workingman
or
a
peasant
almost
a
gentleman
at
eaton
he
learned
his
trade
thoroughly
he
knows
how
to
groom
a
stylish
horse
how
to
take
care
of
it
when
it
is
sick
and
what
detailed
and
complicated
toilets
are
most
suitable
to
the
color
of
its
coat
he
knows
the
secret
of
the
intimate
washings
the
refined
polishings
the
expert
pedicurings
and
the
ingenious
processes
of
by
which
the
beasts
of
the
like
the
beasts
of
love
are
set
out
and
beautified
in
the
he
knew
important
jockeys
celebrated
trainers
and
the
baronets
and
blackleg
dukes
and
bums
who
are
the
of
this
and
the
of
this
edgar
would
have
liked
to
become
a
jockey
for
he
soon
saw
all
the
tricks
that
could
be
played
and
the
money
that
could
be
made
but
he
had
grown
too
large
though
his
legs
had
remained
thin
and
bowed
he
had
acquired
something
of
a
corporation
he
was
too
heavy
so
being
unable
to
don
the
jockey
coat
he
decided
to
wear
the
coachman
livery
edgar
is
years
old
he
is
one
of
the
five
or
six
english
italian
and
french
of
whom
they
talk
in
elegant
society
with
wondering
admiration
his
name
triumphs
in
the
sporting
papers
and
even
in
the
paragraphs
of
the
society
and
literary
journals
the
baron
de
borgsheim
his
present
master
is
proud
of
him
more
proud
of
him
than
he
would
be
of
a
financial
operation
that
had
ruined
a
hundred
thousand
janitors
swelling
up
with
an
air
of
definitive
superiority
he
says
my
as
a
collector
of
pictures
would
say
my
rubens
and
in
fact
the
lucky
baron
has
reason
to
be
proud
for
since
he
came
into
possession
of
edgar
he
has
made
great
strides
in
fame
and
respectability
edgar
has
gained
for
him
that
admission
to
uncompromising
which
he
so
long
coveted
through
edgar
he
has
at
last
overcome
the
resistance
of
society
to
his
race
at
the
club
they
talk
of
the
famous
victory
of
the
baron
over
england
the
english
have
taken
egypt
from
us
but
the
baron
has
taken
edgar
from
the
english
and
that
restores
the
equilibrium
if
he
had
conquered
the
indies
he
would
not
have
been
more
loudly
acclaimed
this
admiration
is
accompanied
however
by
deep
jealousy
they
would
like
to
get
edgar
away
from
him
and
so
there
goes
on
around
edgar
all
sorts
of
intrigues
and
corrupting
conspiracies
and
flirtations
like
those
that
go
on
around
a
beautiful
woman
as
for
the
newspapers
they
in
their
respectful
enthusiasm
have
reached
a
point
where
they
are
no
longer
able
to
tell
exactly
which
of
the
two
edgar
or
the
baron
is
the
admirable
and
which
the
admirable
financier
they
confound
the
two
in
the
mutual
glories
of
one
and
the
same
apotheosis
provided
you
have
been
curious
enough
to
circulate
among
aristocratic
crowds
you
certainly
must
have
met
edgar
who
is
one
of
their
most
precious
ornaments
and
one
who
is
most
commonly
displayed
he
is
a
man
of
average
height
very
ugly
that
comical
english
ugliness
and
having
an
immoderately
long
nose
with
doubly
royal
curves
which
oscillate
between
the
semitic
curve
and
the
bourbon
curve
his
lips
very
short
and
reveal
black
holes
between
decaying
teeth
his
complexion
is
lightened
in
the
scale
of
the
yellows
relieved
at
the
with
some
hatchings
in
bright
lake
without
being
obese
like
the
majestic
coachman
of
the
olden
time
he
is
now
endowed
with
a
comfortable
and
regular
which
covers
with
fat
the
vulgar
protuberances
of
his
frame
and
slightly
throwing
out
his
chest
he
walks
with
an
elastic
step
his
elbows
bent
at
the
regulation
angle
scorning
to
follow
the
fashion
desirous
rather
of
setting
it
he
dresses
richly
and
fantastically
he
has
blue
with
facings
excessively
and
too
new
pantaloons
of
english
cut
that
are
too
light
cravats
that
are
too
white
jewels
that
are
too
big
handkerchiefs
that
are
too
fragrant
shoes
that
are
too
highly
polished
hats
that
are
too
shining
how
long
the
young
swells
have
envied
edgar
the
unusual
and
fulgurating
brilliancy
of
his
headgear
at
eight
in
the
morning
wearing
a
little
round
hat
and
a
overcoat
as
short
as
a
jacket
with
an
enormous
yellow
rose
in
his
edgar
descends
from
his
automobile
in
front
of
the
baron
mansion
the
grooming
is
just
finished
after
having
cast
an
look
around
the
yard
he
enters
the
stables
and
begins
his
inspection
followed
by
the
anxious
and
respectful
hostlers
nothing
escapes
his
suspicious
and
sidewise
glances
a
bucket
not
in
its
place
a
spot
on
the
steel
chains
a
scratch
on
the
silvers
and
brasses
and
he
growls
flies
into
a
passion
and
threatens
in
a
voice
his
bronchial
tubes
being
still
obstructed
by
the
fermentation
of
the
champagne
drunk
the
night
before
he
enters
each
box
and
passes
his
hand
over
the
manes
necks
bellies
and
legs
of
the
horses
if
he
finds
the
slightest
trace
of
dirt
on
his
glove
he
jaws
the
hostlers
there
is
a
flood
of
filthy
words
and
insulting
oaths
and
a
tempest
of
furious
gestures
then
he
examines
minutely
the
horses
hoofs
smells
of
the
oats
in
the
marble
mangers
feels
of
the
litter
and
long
and
carefully
studies
the
form
color
and
density
of
the
dung
which
never
suits
him
what
kind
of
dung
do
you
call
that
i
should
like
to
know
it
is
the
dung
of
a
be
sure
that
i
see
nothing
like
it
pack
of
that
you
are
sometimes
the
baron
puts
in
an
appearance
glad
of
a
chance
to
talk
with
his
scarcely
does
he
notice
his
master
presence
the
latter
timid
questions
he
answers
with
curt
and
snarling
words
never
does
he
say
monsieur
the
baron
the
baron
on
the
contrary
is
almost
tempted
to
say
monsieur
the
coachman
afraid
that
he
may
irritate
edgar
he
does
not
stay
long
and
retires
discreetly
having
finished
his
review
of
the
stables
the
and
the
and
having
given
his
orders
in
a
tone
of
military
command
edgar
gets
into
his
automobile
again
and
starts
rapidly
for
the
where
at
first
he
makes
a
short
stop
in
a
little
among
people
tipsters
who
drop
mysterious
words
into
his
ears
and
show
him
confidential
dispatches
the
rest
of
the
morning
is
devoted
to
visits
to
sundry
to
give
them
new
orders
and
receive
commissions
and
to
with
whom
such
conversations
as
the
following
take
place
well
master
edgar
well
master
poolny
i
have
a
buyer
for
the
baron
bays
they
are
not
for
sale
fifty
pounds
for
you
no
a
hundred
pounds
master
edgar
we
will
see
master
poolny
that
is
not
all
master
edgar
what
else
master
poolny
i
have
two
magnificent
sorrels
for
the
baron
we
do
not
need
them
fifty
pounds
for
you
no
a
hundred
pounds
master
edgar
we
will
see
master
poolny
a
week
later
edgar
has
spoiled
the
paces
of
the
baron
bays
in
just
the
right
degree
not
too
much
or
too
little
and
then
having
demonstrated
to
the
baron
that
it
is
high
time
to
get
rid
of
them
he
sells
them
to
poolny
who
sells
to
edgar
the
two
magnificent
sorrels
poolny
restores
the
bays
to
good
condition
by
sending
them
to
pasture
for
three
months
and
two
years
later
perhaps
sells
them
again
to
the
baron
at
noon
edgar
work
is
done
he
returns
for
lunch
to
his
apartments
in
the
rue
euler
for
he
does
not
live
in
the
baron
mansion
and
never
drives
the
baron
his
apartments
consist
of
a
heavily
upholstered
in
embroidered
plush
of
the
loudest
shades
the
walls
being
covered
with
english
lithographs
of
hunts
steeplechases
famous
cracks
and
various
portraits
of
the
prince
of
wales
one
of
which
was
presented
to
edgar
by
the
prince
himself
and
bears
a
dedication
from
him
then
there
are
canes
whips
stirrups
bits
and
horns
arranged
in
a
panoply
with
an
enormous
bust
of
queen
victoria
made
of
polychromatic
and
loyalist
terra
cotta
in
the
centre
between
two
gilded
pediments
then
free
from
care
strangling
in
his
blue
his
head
covered
with
his
radiant
beacon
edgar
devotes
the
rest
of
his
day
to
his
own
affairs
and
to
his
own
pleasures
his
affairs
are
numerous
for
he
is
in
partnership
with
a
club
cashier
a
bookmaker
and
a
horse
photographer
and
he
has
three
horses
in
training
near
chantilly
nor
are
his
pleasures
lacking
the
most
famous
little
women
know
the
way
to
the
rue
euler
where
on
days
when
they
happen
to
be
short
they
are
sure
to
find
a
cup
of
tea
and
five
louis
in
the
evening
after
having
shown
himself
at
the
ambassadeurs
at
the
cirque
and
at
the
olympia
very
correct
in
his
edgar
repairs
to
the
and
there
spends
a
long
time
in
getting
drunk
in
the
company
of
coachmen
who
assume
the
airs
of
gentlemen
and
of
gentlemen
who
assume
the
airs
of
coachmen
and
every
time
that
william
told
me
one
of
these
stories
he
concluded
with
a
voice
of
admiring
wonder
oh
this
edgar
there
is
a
man
for
you
indeed
my
masters
belonged
to
what
it
is
agreed
to
call
the
high
society
of
paris
that
is
to
say
monsieur
was
a
penniless
nobleman
and
nobody
knew
exactly
where
madame
came
from
many
stories
were
afloat
regarding
her
origin
each
more
disagreeable
than
the
others
william
very
familiar
with
the
scandals
of
high
society
pretended
that
the
madame
was
the
daughter
of
an
old
coachman
and
an
old
chambermaid
who
by
pinching
and
general
misbehavior
got
together
a
small
capital
established
themselves
as
usurers
in
a
disreputable
quarter
of
paris
and
rapidly
made
a
large
fortune
by
lending
money
mainly
to
prostitutes
and
they
struck
it
rich
indeed
it
was
certainly
true
that
madame
in
spite
of
her
apparent
elegance
and
her
very
pretty
face
had
queer
manners
and
vulgar
habits
that
were
very
disagreeable
the
dirty
creature
was
fond
of
boiled
beef
and
bacon
and
cabbage
and
like
the
cabmen
it
was
her
delight
to
pour
red
wine
into
her
soup
i
was
ashamed
of
her
often
in
her
quarrels
with
monsieur
her
anger
stirred
the
mud
that
still
remained
in
the
depths
of
her
being
not
yet
thoroughly
cleaned
by
her
luxury
and
brought
up
to
her
lips
a
filthy
foam
of
words
ah
words
that
i
who
am
not
a
lady
often
regret
having
uttered
but
there
you
are
one
does
not
imagine
how
many
women
there
are
with
mouths
and
starry
eyes
and
dresses
who
in
their
own
houses
use
coarse
language
make
filthy
gestures
and
are
disgusting
by
their
vulgarity
in
fact
strumpets
of
the
lowest
type
great
ladies
said
william
are
like
the
best
sauces
it
is
better
not
to
know
how
they
are
made
william
was
given
to
these
disenchanting
aphorisms
and
being
all
the
same
a
very
gallant
man
he
added
as
he
took
me
about
the
waist
a
little
girl
like
you
is
less
flattering
to
a
lover
vanity
but
she
is
more
serious
all
the
same
i
must
say
that
madame
spent
all
her
wrath
and
showered
all
her
coarse
words
upon
monsieur
with
us
i
repeat
she
was
rather
timid
moreover
amid
the
disorder
of
her
house
amid
all
the
reckless
waste
she
tolerated
madame
showed
queer
streaks
of
avarice
that
were
quite
unexpected
she
higgled
with
the
cook
over
two
sous
spent
for
salad
economized
in
the
matter
of
the
servants
washing
raised
objections
to
a
bill
of
three
francs
and
did
not
rest
until
after
endless
complaints
and
correspondence
and
interminable
negotiations
she
had
secured
a
refunding
of
fifteen
centimes
unwarrantably
collected
by
an
expressman
for
the
transportation
of
a
package
every
time
she
took
a
cab
there
was
a
quarrel
with
the
coachman
to
whom
she
gave
no
tip
and
whom
she
even
found
a
way
of
cheating
and
yet
she
left
her
money
about
everywhere
with
her
jewels
and
her
keys
on
the
mantels
and
on
the
furniture
she
recklessly
ruined
her
richest
costumes
and
her
finest
linen
she
suffered
herself
to
be
impudently
robbed
by
dealers
in
articles
of
luxury
and
accepted
with
without
a
frown
the
books
of
the
old
butler
as
monsieur
for
that
matter
accepted
those
of
william
and
yet
god
knows
what
frauds
they
contained
sometimes
i
said
to
william
really
you
pinch
too
much
some
day
you
will
get
into
trouble
to
which
william
replied
very
calmly
oh
let
me
alone
i
know
what
i
am
about
and
how
far
i
can
go
when
one
has
masters
as
stupid
as
these
are
it
would
be
a
crime
not
to
take
advantage
of
them
but
the
poor
fellow
scarcely
profited
by
these
continual
larcenies
which
in
spite
of
the
astonishing
tips
he
had
continually
went
to
fill
the
pockets
of
the
bookmakers
monsieur
and
madame
had
been
married
for
five
years
at
first
they
went
into
society
a
great
deal
and
gave
dinners
then
gradually
they
restricted
their
and
their
receptions
and
lived
almost
alone
saying
that
they
were
jealous
of
each
other
madame
reproached
monsieur
with
flirting
with
the
women
monsieur
accused
madame
of
looking
too
much
at
the
men
they
loved
each
other
much
that
is
to
say
they
quarreled
all
day
long
like
a
little
household
the
truth
is
that
madame
had
not
succeeded
in
society
and
that
her
manners
had
cost
her
not
a
few
insults
she
was
angry
with
monsieur
for
not
having
been
able
to
impose
her
upon
society
and
monsieur
was
angry
with
madame
for
having
made
him
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
they
did
not
confess
to
each
other
the
bitterness
of
their
feelings
finding
it
simpler
to
charge
their
dissensions
to
the
score
of
love
every
year
in
the
middle
of
june
they
started
for
the
country
madame
having
it
seems
a
magnificent
château
in
touraine
the
personnel
was
with
a
coachman
two
gardeners
a
second
chambermaid
and
some
there
were
cows
peacocks
hens
and
rabbits
how
delightful
william
told
me
the
details
of
their
country
life
with
a
bitter
and
grumbling
he
did
not
like
the
country
the
fields
the
trees
and
the
flowers
made
him
tired
nature
was
endurable
to
him
only
with
bookmakers
and
jockeys
he
was
exclusively
parisian
do
you
know
anything
more
stupid
than
a
chestnut
tree
he
often
said
to
me
take
edgar
for
instance
he
is
a
man
a
superior
man
does
he
like
the
country
i
became
enthusiastic
oh
but
the
flowers
in
the
broad
lawns
and
the
little
birds
william
sneered
the
flowers
they
are
pretty
only
on
hats
and
in
the
millinery
shops
and
the
little
birds
oh
do
talk
about
them
they
prevent
you
from
sleeping
in
the
morning
they
sound
like
bawling
children
oh
no
oh
no
i
have
enough
of
the
country
the
country
is
fit
only
for
peasants
and
straightening
up
with
a
noble
gesture
he
concluded
in
a
proud
voice
i
must
have
sport
i
am
not
a
peasant
i
am
a
sportsman
nevertheless
i
was
happy
and
i
awaited
the
month
of
june
with
impatience
oh
the
marguerites
in
the
meadows
the
little
paths
under
the
trembling
leaves
the
nests
hidden
in
the
ivies
against
the
old
walls
and
the
nightingales
on
moonlight
nights
and
the
sweet
conversations
hand
in
hand
on
the
brinks
of
wells
lined
with
honeysuckles
and
carpeted
with
and
moss
and
the
bowls
of
foaming
milk
and
the
straw
hats
and
the
little
chickens
and
the
masses
heard
in
the
village
churches
with
their
towering
steeples
and
everything
that
moves
and
charms
you
and
makes
an
impression
on
your
heart
like
one
of
those
pretty
ballads
they
sing
in
the
although
i
am
fond
of
fun
i
have
a
poetical
nature
the
old
shepherds
the
outspread
hay
the
birds
that
pursue
one
another
from
branch
to
branch
and
the
brooks
that
run
singing
over
light
pebbles
and
the
handsome
lads
with
complexions
made
purple
by
the
sun
like
grapes
on
very
old
vines
the
handsome
lads
with
robust
limbs
and
powerful
chests
all
these
things
make
me
dream
pleasant
dreams
in
thinking
of
these
things
i
become
almost
a
little
girl
again
my
soul
inundated
and
my
heart
refreshed
by
innocence
and
candor
as
a
little
rain
refreshes
the
little
flower
too
much
burned
by
the
sun
too
much
dried
by
the
wind
and
at
night
while
waiting
for
william
becoming
enthusiastic
over
the
prospects
of
this
future
of
pure
joys
i
made
verses
petite
fleur
o
toi
ma
soeur
dont
la
senteur
fait
mon
bonheur
et
toi
ruisseau
lointain
coteau
frêle
arbrisseau
au
bord
de
que
dire
dans
mon
délire
je
vous
admire
et
je
soupire
amour
amour
amour
jour
et
de
toujours
amour
amour
as
soon
as
william
returned
all
poesy
flew
away
he
brought
me
the
heavy
odor
of
the
and
his
kisses
which
smelt
of
gin
quickly
broke
the
wings
of
my
dream
i
never
wanted
to
show
him
my
verses
what
was
the
use
he
would
have
laughed
at
me
and
at
the
sentiment
that
inspired
them
and
undoubtedly
he
would
have
said
to
me
take
edgar
now
he
is
an
astonishing
man
does
he
make
verses
my
poetical
nature
was
not
the
only
cause
of
my
impatience
to
start
for
the
country
my
stomach
was
out
of
order
in
consequence
of
the
long
period
of
poverty
through
which
i
had
just
passed
and
perhaps
also
in
consequence
of
the
too
abundant
and
exciting
food
that
i
was
now
enjoying
and
the
champagne
and
the
spanish
wines
that
william
forced
me
to
drink
i
was
really
suffering
often
in
the
morning
on
getting
out
of
bed
i
was
seized
with
vertigo
during
the
day
my
legs
bent
under
me
and
i
felt
pains
in
my
head
like
the
blows
of
a
hammer
i
really
needed
a
quieter
life
to
restore
me
a
little
alas
it
was
written
that
all
this
dream
of
happiness
and
health
was
also
to
be
dashed
oh
hell
as
madame
would
say
the
scenes
between
monsieur
and
madame
always
began
in
and
always
grew
out
of
trifling
pretexts
out
of
nothing
the
more
trifling
the
pretext
the
more
violent
was
the
scene
after
which
having
vomited
all
that
their
hearts
contained
of
long
bitterness
and
wrath
they
sulked
for
entire
weeks
monsieur
retired
into
his
room
where
he
played
solitaire
and
rearranged
his
collection
of
pipes
in
new
harmonies
madame
remained
all
the
time
in
her
room
where
stretched
upon
a
long
chair
she
read
love
stories
interrupting
her
reading
only
to
rearrange
her
closets
and
her
wardrobe
with
rage
and
frenzy
such
a
pillage
they
met
only
at
meals
at
first
not
being
familiar
with
their
manias
i
thought
they
were
going
to
throw
plates
knives
and
bottles
at
each
heads
nothing
of
the
kind
alas
it
was
at
these
times
that
they
were
the
best
behaved
and
that
madame
contrived
to
appear
like
a
woman
of
society
they
talked
about
their
little
affairs
as
if
nothing
had
happened
a
little
more
ceremoniously
than
usual
with
a
little
more
cold
and
stilted
politeness
that
was
all
one
would
have
said
they
were
dining
in
town
then
the
meal
finished
with
serious
air
sad
eyes
and
very
dignified
they
retired
to
their
respective
rooms
madame
began
again
on
her
novels
and
drawers
monsieur
on
his
solitaire
and
his
pipes
sometimes
monsieur
went
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
at
his
club
but
rarely
and
they
exchanged
a
furious
correspondence
or
with
the
transmission
of
which
i
was
entrusted
all
day
long
i
played
the
bearing
terrible
ultimatums
threats
supplications
pardons
and
tears
from
the
room
of
madame
to
that
of
monsieur
it
was
enough
to
make
one
die
of
laughter
after
a
few
days
they
became
reconciled
just
as
they
had
fallen
out
without
any
apparent
reason
and
there
were
sobs
and
oh
you
naughty
boy
oh
you
naughty
girl
and
it
is
over
do
i
not
tell
you
it
is
over
and
they
went
away
to
have
a
little
fête
at
the
restaurant
and
the
next
day
arose
very
late
much
fatigued
i
at
once
understood
the
farce
that
the
two
poor
actors
were
playing
for
themselves
and
when
they
threatened
to
leave
each
other
i
knew
very
well
that
they
were
not
sincere
they
were
riveted
to
each
other
he
by
his
interest
she
by
her
vanity
monsieur
clung
to
madame
money
madame
held
fast
to
monsieur
name
and
title
but
as
in
reality
they
detested
each
other
precisely
because
of
this
bargain
that
bound
them
they
felt
the
need
of
saying
so
to
each
other
from
time
to
time
and
of
giving
to
their
disappointment
their
spite
and
their
contempt
an
expression
as
base
as
their
souls
what
are
such
lives
good
for
said
i
to
william
for
baby
answered
william
who
under
all
circumstances
found
the
accurate
and
final
word
for
immediate
and
material
proof
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
magnificent
cigar
pinched
that
very
morning
carefully
cut
off
the
tip
and
then
lighting
it
with
satisfaction
and
tranquillity
declared
between
two
fragrant
whiffs
one
should
never
complain
of
the
stupidity
of
his
masters
my
little
célestine
it
is
the
only
guarantee
of
happiness
that
we
servants
have
the
more
stupid
the
masters
the
more
fortunate
the
servants
go
and
get
me
the
fine
champagne
half
stretched
out
in
a
with
legs
cocked
up
and
crossed
with
the
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
bottle
of
old
martell
within
reach
of
his
hand
he
slowly
and
methodically
unfolded
the
autorité
and
said
with
admirable
good
nature
you
see
my
little
célestine
one
must
be
stronger
than
the
people
whom
one
serves
that
is
the
whole
secret
god
knows
whether
cassagnac
is
a
terrible
man
god
knows
whether
his
ideas
suit
me
to
a
t
and
whether
i
admire
this
tall
devil
well
do
you
know
i
would
not
like
to
be
his
servant
not
for
anything
in
the
world
and
what
i
say
of
cassagnac
i
say
also
of
edgar
remember
this
and
try
to
profit
by
it
to
serve
in
the
houses
of
intelligent
people
who
are
to
us
is
to
be
duped
my
little
pet
and
enjoying
his
cigar
he
added
after
a
silence
when
i
think
that
there
are
servants
who
pass
their
lives
in
running
down
their
masters
in
annoying
them
and
threatening
them
what
brutes
when
i
think
that
there
are
some
who
would
like
to
kill
them
kill
them
and
what
then
do
we
kill
the
cow
that
gives
us
milk
and
the
sheep
that
gives
us
wool
no
we
milk
the
cow
and
shear
the
sheep
skilfully
gently
and
he
silently
plunged
into
the
mysteries
of
conservative
politics
meanwhile
eugénie
was
prowling
around
the
kitchen
amorous
and
flabby
she
did
her
work
mechanically
like
a
somnambulist
far
from
the
people
far
from
us
far
from
herself
with
no
eye
for
their
follies
or
ours
and
with
silent
words
of
sorrowful
admiration
always
on
her
lips
your
little
mouth
your
little
hands
your
big
eyes
all
this
often
saddened
me
i
do
know
why
saddened
me
to
the
point
of
tears
yes
this
strange
house
in
which
all
the
beings
in
it
the
silent
old
butler
william
and
myself
seemed
to
me
disquieting
empty
and
dismal
like
phantoms
sometimes
filled
me
with
unspeakable
and
oppressive
melancholy
the
last
scene
that
i
witnessed
was
particularly
droll
one
morning
monsieur
entered
the
at
the
moment
when
madame
was
trying
on
a
new
corset
in
my
presence
a
frightful
mauve
satin
corset
with
yellow
flowerets
and
yellow
silk
lacings
taste
will
never
choke
her
what
said
madame
in
a
tone
of
gay
reproach
is
that
the
way
one
enters
women
rooms
without
knocking
oh
women
chirped
monsieur
in
the
first
place
you
are
not
women
i
am
not
women
what
am
i
then
monsieur
rounded
his
lips
my
what
a
stupid
air
he
had
and
very
tenderly
or
pretending
tenderness
he
buzzed
why
you
are
my
wife
my
little
wife
my
pretty
little
wife
there
is
no
harm
in
entering
the
room
of
one
little
wife
i
suppose
when
monsieur
played
the
imbecile
lover
it
was
because
he
wanted
to
get
some
money
out
of
madame
she
still
suspicious
replied
yes
there
is
harm
and
she
minced
your
little
wife
your
little
wife
it
is
not
so
sure
that
i
am
your
little
wife
what
it
is
not
so
sure
indeed
one
never
knows
men
are
so
queer
i
tell
you
you
are
my
little
wife
my
dear
my
only
little
wife
ah
and
you
my
baby
my
big
baby
his
little
wife
only
big
baby
na
i
was
lacing
madame
who
with
bare
arms
raised
was
looking
into
the
mirror
and
i
had
a
great
desire
to
laugh
how
they
tired
me
with
their
little
wife
and
their
big
baby
what
a
stupid
air
they
both
had
after
picking
up
skirts
stockings
and
towels
and
disturbing
brushes
jars
and
bottles
monsieur
took
a
fashion
journal
which
was
lying
on
the
and
sat
down
on
a
sort
of
stool
he
asked
is
there
a
rebus
in
this
number
yes
i
think
there
is
a
rebus
have
you
guessed
it
no
i
have
not
guessed
it
ah
ah
let
have
a
look
at
it
while
monsieur
with
wrinkled
brow
was
absorbed
in
the
study
of
the
rebus
madame
said
a
little
dryly
robert
my
darling
then
you
notice
nothing
no
what
in
this
rebus
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
pursed
up
her
lips
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
rebus
then
you
notice
nothing
well
you
never
notice
anything
monsieur
surveyed
the
room
from
carpet
to
ceiling
from
to
door
with
an
annoyed
and
a
very
round
look
which
was
excessively
comical
no
indeed
what
is
it
is
there
anything
new
here
then
that
i
have
not
noticed
i
see
nothing
upon
my
word
madame
became
very
sad
and
she
groaned
robert
you
no
longer
love
me
what
i
no
longer
love
you
indeed
that
is
putting
it
a
little
too
strong
he
rose
brandishing
the
fashion
journal
what
i
no
longer
love
you
he
repeated
well
that
an
idea
why
do
you
say
that
no
you
no
longer
love
me
because
if
you
still
loved
me
you
would
have
noticed
something
but
what
thing
well
you
would
have
noticed
my
corset
what
corset
oh
yes
this
corset
is
true
i
had
not
noticed
it
how
stupid
i
am
why
yes
it
is
very
pretty
you
know
ravishing
yes
you
say
that
now
and
you
do
mean
it
i
am
too
stupid
myself
i
tire
myself
out
in
trying
to
make
myself
beautiful
in
trying
to
find
things
to
please
you
and
you
care
nothing
about
it
besides
what
am
i
to
you
nothing
less
than
nothing
you
come
in
here
and
what
do
you
see
that
dirty
newspaper
in
what
are
you
interested
in
a
rebus
ah
a
pretty
life
you
give
me
here
we
do
not
see
anybody
we
do
not
go
anywhere
we
live
like
wolves
like
poor
people
oh
come
come
i
beg
of
you
do
get
angry
come
as
poor
people
indeed
he
tried
to
approach
madame
to
take
her
about
the
waist
to
kiss
her
but
she
repulsed
him
severely
no
let
me
alone
you
provoke
me
oh
come
my
darling
my
little
wife
you
provoke
me
do
you
hear
let
me
alone
do
not
approach
me
you
are
a
gross
egoist
a
clumsy
puppy
you
do
know
how
to
do
anything
for
me
you
are
a
dirty
type
there
why
do
you
say
that
it
is
madness
come
do
fly
into
a
passion
like
that
well
yes
i
was
wrong
i
ought
to
have
seen
this
corset
right
away
this
very
pretty
corset
why
did
i
not
see
it
right
away
i
do
not
understand
it
look
at
me
smile
at
me
my
how
pretty
it
is
and
how
it
becomes
you
monsieur
dwelt
too
persistently
upon
the
subject
he
irritated
me
although
i
had
no
interest
in
the
quarrel
madame
stamped
on
the
carpet
and
becoming
more
and
more
nervous
with
pale
lips
and
clenched
hands
she
rattled
on
you
provoke
me
you
provoke
me
do
you
understand
clear
out
monsieur
continued
to
stammer
beginning
now
to
show
signs
of
exasperation
my
darling
it
is
not
reasonable
just
for
a
corset
it
is
out
of
all
proportion
come
my
darling
look
at
me
smile
at
me
it
is
stupid
to
make
such
a
fuss
over
a
corset
ah
vomited
madame
in
the
voice
of
a
washerwoman
clear
out
i
had
finished
lacing
my
mistress
i
arose
at
this
word
delighted
at
having
surprised
their
two
beautiful
souls
in
all
their
nakedness
and
at
the
thought
of
the
humiliation
that
they
would
feel
in
my
presence
afterward
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
i
was
there
desiring
to
see
how
the
scene
would
end
i
kept
perfectly
still
and
made
myself
as
small
as
possible
monsieur
who
had
been
holding
in
for
a
long
time
now
got
angry
in
his
turn
he
made
the
fashion
journal
into
a
big
ball
and
flung
it
with
all
his
might
against
the
and
he
cried
flûte
this
is
really
getting
too
tiresome
it
is
always
the
same
thing
one
can
not
say
anything
or
do
anything
without
being
received
like
a
dog
and
always
brutalities
and
coarse
language
i
have
enough
of
this
life
i
have
had
enough
of
these
fishwife
manners
and
shall
i
tell
you
the
truth
your
corset
well
your
corset
is
vile
it
is
a
prostitute
corset
wretch
with
bloodshot
eye
foaming
mouth
and
clenched
and
threatening
fist
she
advanced
toward
monsieur
and
such
was
her
rage
that
the
words
came
from
her
mouth
in
a
sort
of
hoarse
belching
wretch
she
roared
again
and
it
is
you
who
dare
to
speak
to
me
in
this
way
you
oh
but
it
is
unheard
of
when
i
picked
him
up
in
the
mud
this
fine
gentleman
covered
with
dirty
debts
posted
at
his
club
when
i
saved
him
from
the
mire
he
was
not
so
proud
your
name
i
suppose
your
title
oh
clean
they
were
indeed
this
name
and
title
on
which
the
usurers
were
unwilling
to
advance
you
another
hundred
sous
you
can
take
them
back
and
welcome
and
he
talks
of
his
nobility
of
his
ancestors
this
monsieur
whom
i
have
bought
and
whom
i
support
well
the
nobility
will
have
nothing
more
from
me
not
that
and
as
for
your
ancestors
you
scoundrel
you
can
try
to
hang
them
up
you
will
see
whether
you
can
borrow
even
ten
sous
on
their
ugly
mugs
mugs
of
veterans
and
valets
nothing
more
do
you
hear
never
never
back
to
your
trickster
back
to
your
prostitutes
pimp
she
was
frightful
monsieur
timid
trembling
with
cowardly
back
and
humiliated
eye
retired
before
this
flood
of
filth
he
reached
the
door
noticed
me
and
fled
and
madame
again
cried
after
him
in
the
in
a
voice
which
had
become
more
hoarse
and
horrible
pimp
dirty
pimp
and
she
sank
upon
her
long
chair
overcome
by
a
terrible
nervous
attack
which
i
finally
quieted
by
making
her
inhale
an
entire
flask
of
ether
then
madame
began
again
the
reading
of
her
love
stories
and
the
rearrangement
of
her
drawers
monsieur
was
more
absorbed
than
ever
in
the
complexities
of
solitaire
and
in
the
revision
of
his
collection
of
pipes
and
the
correspondence
began
again
timid
and
at
first
it
was
soon
going
on
fast
and
furiously
i
became
utterly
tired
out
with
running
from
the
room
of
one
to
the
room
of
the
other
bearing
or
threats
but
oh
what
fun
i
had
three
days
after
this
scene
while
reading
a
missive
from
monsieur
on
pink
paper
and
bearing
his
coat
of
arms
madame
turned
pale
and
suddenly
asked
me
in
a
gasping
voice
célestine
do
you
really
think
that
monsieur
wants
to
kill
himself
have
you
seen
him
with
weapons
in
his
hands
my
god
if
he
were
to
kill
himself
i
burst
out
laughing
in
madame
face
and
this
laugh
which
had
escaped
me
in
spite
of
myself
increased
let
itself
loose
poured
itself
out
i
thought
i
should
die
choked
by
this
laugh
strangled
by
this
cursed
laugh
that
rose
like
a
tempest
in
my
breast
and
filled
my
throat
with
irrepressible
hiccups
for
a
moment
madame
sat
aghast
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
do
you
laugh
like
that
be
still
then
will
you
be
still
nasty
creature
but
the
laugh
held
me
fast
it
would
not
let
go
at
last
between
two
gasps
i
cried
oh
no
your
goings
on
are
too
funny
too
stupid
oh
la
la
oh
la
la
how
stupid
it
is
of
course
i
quit
the
house
that
night
and
found
myself
once
more
on
the
street
pavement
what
a
dog
of
a
trade
what
a
dog
of
a
life
the
blow
was
a
hard
one
and
i
said
to
myself
but
too
late
that
never
should
i
find
another
place
like
that
there
i
had
everything
good
wages
profits
of
all
sorts
easy
work
liberty
pleasures
i
had
only
to
let
myself
live
another
less
crazy
than
i
would
have
been
able
to
put
much
money
aside
and
gradually
accumulate
a
complete
and
beautiful
wardrobe
five
or
six
years
only
and
who
knows
one
could
marry
buy
a
little
business
have
a
home
of
one
own
secure
against
want
and
almost
a
lady
but
now
the
series
of
miseries
must
begin
over
again
and
i
submit
anew
to
the
offences
of
chance
i
was
much
put
out
by
this
accident
and
furious
furious
against
myself
against
william
against
eugénie
against
madame
against
everybody
curious
and
inexplicable
thing
instead
of
clinging
and
holding
fast
to
my
place
which
would
have
been
easy
with
a
type
like
madame
i
had
buried
myself
deeper
in
my
stupidity
and
cheeking
it
through
i
had
rendered
irreparable
that
which
could
have
been
repaired
what
strange
things
take
place
in
one
at
certain
moments
it
passes
understanding
it
is
like
a
fit
of
madness
which
falls
upon
you
you
know
not
whence
you
know
not
why
which
seizes
you
shakes
you
excites
you
and
forces
you
to
cry
out
and
shower
insults
under
the
influence
of
this
fit
of
madness
i
had
heaped
outrages
upon
madame
i
had
reproached
her
with
her
father
with
her
mother
and
with
the
imbecile
falsehood
of
her
life
i
had
treated
her
as
one
does
not
treat
a
prostitute
i
had
spat
upon
her
husband
and
this
frightens
me
when
i
think
of
it
i
feel
ashamed
of
these
sudden
descents
into
baseness
of
these
filthy
intoxications
in
which
my
reason
so
often
staggers
and
which
impel
me
to
violence
and
murder
why
did
i
not
kill
her
that
day
why
did
i
not
strangle
her
i
do
not
know
god
knows
however
that
i
am
not
wicked
i
see
again
this
poor
woman
in
my
mind
eye
i
see
again
her
sad
and
disorderly
life
with
her
coward
her
dismal
coward
of
a
husband
and
i
feel
an
immense
pity
for
her
and
i
would
like
her
to
have
strength
enough
to
leave
him
and
be
happy
after
the
terrible
scene
i
hurried
down
to
the
servants
hall
william
was
mildly
polishing
the
silverware
and
smoking
a
russian
cigarette
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
he
in
the
most
tranquil
fashion
in
the
world
i
must
go
away
i
must
quit
the
box
i
gasped
i
could
scarcely
speak
what
you
are
going
exclaimed
william
without
the
least
emotion
and
why
in
short
and
hissing
phrases
and
mimicking
their
manners
i
related
the
entire
scene
between
madame
and
monsieur
william
very
calm
and
indifferent
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
too
stupid
indeed
said
he
one
should
not
be
as
stupid
as
that
and
that
is
all
you
find
to
say
to
me
what
else
do
you
expect
me
to
say
to
you
i
say
that
it
is
stupid
there
is
nothing
else
to
say
and
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
looked
at
me
obliquely
there
was
a
sneer
on
his
lips
ah
how
ugly
was
his
look
in
that
moment
of
distress
how
ugly
and
hideous
was
his
mouth
i
said
he
pretending
not
to
understand
that
in
this
question
there
were
prayers
for
him
yes
you
i
asked
you
what
you
were
going
to
do
nothing
i
have
nothing
to
do
i
am
going
to
continue
why
you
are
crazy
my
girl
you
do
not
expect
i
burst
out
you
are
going
to
have
the
courage
to
remain
in
a
house
from
which
i
am
driven
out
he
rose
relighted
his
cigarette
and
said
icily
oh
no
scene
you
know
i
am
not
your
husband
you
have
seen
fit
to
commit
a
stupidity
i
am
not
responsible
for
it
what
do
you
expect
you
must
take
the
consequences
life
is
life
i
became
indignant
then
you
are
going
to
drop
me
you
are
a
wretch
a
scoundrel
like
the
others
do
you
know
it
william
smiled
he
was
really
a
superior
man
oh
do
say
useless
things
i
have
made
you
no
promises
nor
have
you
made
me
any
people
meet
that
is
well
they
part
that
is
well
too
life
is
life
and
he
added
sententiously
you
see
célestine
in
life
there
must
be
conduct
there
must
be
what
i
call
administration
you
have
no
conduct
you
have
no
administration
you
allow
yourself
to
be
carried
away
by
your
nerves
in
our
business
nerves
are
a
very
bad
thing
remember
this
well
life
is
life
i
think
i
should
have
thrown
myself
upon
him
and
torn
his
face
his
emotionless
and
cowardly
face
of
a
flunky
with
furious
digs
of
my
nails
if
tears
had
not
suddenly
come
to
soften
and
relax
my
overstrained
nerves
my
wrath
fell
and
i
begged
oh
william
william
my
little
william
my
dear
little
william
how
unhappy
i
am
william
tried
to
revive
my
drooping
spirits
a
little
i
must
say
that
he
made
use
of
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
and
all
his
philosophy
during
the
day
he
generously
overwhelmed
me
with
lofty
thoughts
with
grave
and
consoling
aphorisms
in
which
these
words
provoking
and
soothing
at
the
same
time
continually
recurred
life
is
life
i
must
do
him
justice
this
last
day
he
was
charming
though
a
little
too
solemn
and
he
did
things
very
well
in
the
evening
after
dinner
he
put
my
trunks
on
a
cab
and
escorted
me
to
a
where
he
was
known
paying
a
week
rent
in
advance
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
recommending
the
proprietor
to
take
good
care
of
me
but
he
could
not
stay
himself
for
he
had
an
appointment
with
edgar
you
understand
of
course
that
i
can
not
disappoint
edgar
and
perhaps
too
he
might
know
of
a
place
for
you
a
place
gotten
through
edgar
ah
that
would
be
astonishing
on
leaving
me
he
said
i
will
come
to
see
you
be
wise
no
more
stupidities
they
do
you
no
good
and
get
this
truth
well
into
your
head
célestine
that
life
is
life
the
next
day
i
waited
for
him
in
vain
he
did
not
come
it
is
life
i
said
to
myself
but
the
following
day
being
impatient
to
see
him
i
went
to
the
house
i
found
in
the
kitchen
only
a
tall
blonde
girl
bold
and
pretty
prettier
than
i
eugénie
is
not
here
i
asked
no
she
is
not
here
answered
the
tall
girl
dryly
and
william
nor
william
either
where
is
he
how
do
i
know
i
want
to
see
him
go
tell
him
i
want
to
see
him
the
tall
girl
looked
at
me
scornfully
say
am
i
your
servant
i
understood
it
all
and
being
tired
of
struggling
i
went
away
it
is
life
this
phrase
pursued
me
obsessed
me
like
a
refrain
and
as
i
went
away
i
could
not
help
thinking
not
without
a
feeling
of
sorrowful
melancholy
of
the
joy
with
which
i
had
been
welcomed
in
that
house
the
same
scene
must
have
taken
place
they
had
opened
the
usual
bottle
of
champagne
william
had
taken
the
blonde
girl
on
his
knees
and
had
whispered
in
her
ear
you
will
have
to
be
nice
with
baby
the
same
words
the
same
movements
the
same
caresses
while
eugénie
devouring
the
janitor
son
with
her
eyes
led
him
into
the
adjoining
room
your
little
phiz
your
little
hands
your
big
eyes
i
walked
on
utterly
irresolute
and
stupefied
repeating
to
myself
with
stupid
obstinacy
yes
indeed
it
is
life
it
is
life
for
more
than
an
hour
in
front
of
the
door
i
paced
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
hoping
that
william
might
come
in
or
go
out
i
saw
the
grocer
enter
a
little
milliner
with
two
big
and
the
from
the
louvre
i
saw
the
plumbers
come
out
and
i
know
not
who
or
what
else
shades
shades
shades
i
did
not
dare
to
go
into
the
janitor
lodge
in
the
next
house
the
janitress
undoubtedly
would
not
have
received
me
well
and
what
would
she
have
said
to
me
then
i
went
away
for
good
still
pursued
by
the
irritating
refrain
it
is
life
the
streets
seemed
to
me
intolerably
sad
the
made
upon
me
the
impression
of
spectres
when
i
saw
in
the
distance
a
hat
shining
on
a
gentleman
head
like
a
in
the
night
like
a
gilded
cupola
in
the
sunshine
my
heart
leaped
but
it
was
never
william
in
the
lowering
sky
no
hope
was
shining
i
returned
to
my
room
disgusted
with
everything
ah
yes
the
men
be
they
coachmen
dudes
priests
or
poets
they
are
all
the
same
wretches
i
think
that
these
are
the
last
recollections
that
i
shall
call
up
i
have
others
however
many
others
but
they
all
resemble
each
other
and
it
tires
me
to
continually
write
the
same
stories
and
to
unroll
in
a
continuous
and
monotonous
panorama
the
same
faces
the
same
souls
the
same
phantoms
and
then
i
feel
that
i
have
no
mind
left
for
it
for
i
am
becoming
more
and
more
distracted
from
the
ashes
of
this
past
by
the
new
preoccupations
of
my
future
i
could
have
told
also
of
my
stay
in
the
countess
fardin
mansion
but
what
is
the
use
i
am
too
weary
and
also
too
distressed
there
amid
the
same
social
phenomena
there
was
one
vanity
that
disgusts
me
more
than
any
other
literary
vanity
one
species
of
stupidity
that
is
lower
than
any
other
political
stupidity
there
i
knew
paul
bourget
in
all
his
glory
it
is
needless
to
say
more
ah
there
you
have
the
philosopher
the
poet
the
moralist
befitting
the
pretentious
nullity
the
intellectual
hollowness
the
falsehood
of
that
sphere
of
society
in
which
everything
is
artificial
elegance
love
cooking
religious
feeling
patriotism
art
charity
and
vice
itself
which
making
a
pretext
of
politeness
and
literature
wraps
itself
in
mystical
tinsel
and
covers
itself
with
sacred
masks
that
sphere
of
society
in
which
there
is
to
be
found
but
one
sincere
desire
the
fierce
desire
for
money
which
gives
to
these
ridiculous
mountebanks
something
even
more
odious
and
grim
than
their
ridiculousness
that
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
of
these
poor
phantoms
living
human
creatures
there
i
knew
monsieur
jean
he
too
a
psychologist
and
a
moralist
a
moralist
of
the
servants
hall
a
psychologist
of
the
scarcely
more
of
a
in
his
way
or
more
of
a
ninny
than
he
who
reigned
in
the
monsieur
jean
emptied
paul
bourget
emptied
souls
between
the
servants
hall
and
the
there
is
not
such
a
distance
of
servitude
as
we
think
but
since
i
have
put
monsieur
jean
photograph
in
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
let
his
memory
remain
similarly
buried
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
under
a
thick
layer
of
oblivion
it
is
two
in
the
morning
my
fire
is
going
out
my
lamp
is
smoking
and
i
have
no
more
wood
or
oil
i
am
going
to
bed
but
there
is
too
much
fever
in
my
brain
i
shall
not
sleep
i
shall
dream
of
him
who
is
on
the
way
to
me
i
shall
dream
of
what
is
to
happen
outside
the
night
is
calm
and
silent
a
sharp
cold
air
is
hardening
the
ground
beneath
a
sky
sparkling
with
stars
and
somewhere
in
this
night
joseph
is
on
his
way
through
space
i
see
him
yes
really
i
see
him
serious
dreaming
enormous
in
his
compartment
in
a
railway
carriage
he
is
smiling
at
me
he
is
drawing
nearer
to
me
he
is
coming
toward
me
he
is
bringing
me
at
last
peace
liberty
happiness
happiness
i
shall
see
him
xvii
it
is
eight
months
since
i
have
written
a
single
line
in
this
diary
i
have
had
something
else
to
do
and
to
think
of
and
it
is
exactly
three
months
since
joseph
and
i
left
the
priory
and
established
ourselves
in
the
little
café
at
cherbourg
near
the
harbor
we
are
married
business
is
good
i
like
the
trade
i
am
happy
born
by
the
sea
i
have
come
back
to
the
sea
i
did
not
miss
it
but
it
gives
me
pleasure
all
the
same
to
find
it
again
here
one
does
not
see
the
desolate
landscapes
of
audierne
the
infinite
sadness
of
its
coasts
the
magnificent
horror
of
its
beaches
that
howl
so
mournfully
here
nothing
is
sad
on
the
contrary
everything
contributes
to
gaiety
there
is
the
joyous
sound
of
a
military
city
the
picturesque
movement
and
varied
activity
of
a
military
harbor
crowds
in
a
hurry
to
enjoy
between
two
periods
of
exile
spectacles
incessantly
changing
and
diverting
in
which
i
inhale
that
natal
odor
of
coal
tar
and
which
i
love
although
i
never
found
it
agreeable
in
my
childhood
i
have
seen
again
the
lads
of
my
native
province
now
serving
on
state
we
have
scarcely
talked
together
and
i
have
not
dreamed
of
asking
them
for
news
of
my
brother
it
is
so
long
ago
to
me
it
is
as
if
he
were
dead
good
day
good
evening
be
good
when
they
are
not
drunk
they
are
too
stupid
when
they
are
not
stupid
they
are
too
drunk
and
they
have
heads
like
those
of
old
fishes
between
them
and
me
there
has
been
no
other
emotion
no
other
effusion
besides
joseph
does
not
like
me
to
be
familiar
with
simple
seamen
dirty
bretons
who
have
a
sou
and
who
get
drunk
on
a
glass
of
but
i
must
relate
briefly
the
events
that
preceded
our
departure
from
the
priory
it
will
be
remembered
that
at
the
priory
joseph
slept
in
the
over
the
every
day
summer
and
winter
he
rose
at
five
now
on
the
morning
of
december
just
a
month
after
his
return
from
cherbourg
he
noticed
that
the
was
wide
open
what
said
he
to
himself
can
they
have
risen
already
he
noticed
at
the
same
time
that
a
square
of
glass
had
been
cut
out
of
the
glass
door
with
a
diamond
near
the
lock
in
such
a
way
as
to
admit
the
introduction
of
an
arm
the
lock
had
been
forced
by
expert
hands
bits
of
wood
glass
and
twisted
iron
were
strewn
along
the
stone
flagging
within
all
the
doors
so
carefully
bolted
at
night
under
madame
eyes
were
open
also
one
felt
that
something
frightful
had
happened
greatly
impressed
i
tell
the
story
of
his
discovery
as
he
told
it
himself
before
the
magistrates
joseph
passed
through
the
kitchen
and
then
through
the
into
which
opened
at
the
right
the
the
and
the
at
the
left
the
servants
hall
the
and
the
little
and
at
the
end
the
grand
the
presented
a
spectacle
of
frightful
disorder
of
real
pillage
the
furniture
was
upset
the
sideboard
had
been
ransacked
from
top
to
bottom
its
drawers
as
well
as
those
of
the
two
were
turned
upside
down
on
the
carpet
and
on
the
table
among
empty
boxes
and
a
confused
heap
of
valueless
articles
a
candle
was
burning
itself
out
in
a
brass
candlestick
but
it
was
in
the
servants
hall
that
the
spectacle
became
really
imposing
in
the
servants
hall
i
believe
i
have
already
noted
the
fact
there
was
a
very
deep
closet
protected
by
a
very
complicated
system
of
locks
the
secret
of
which
was
known
only
to
madame
there
slept
the
famous
and
venerable
silver
service
in
three
heavy
boxes
with
steel
corners
and
the
boxes
were
screwed
to
the
floor
and
held
fast
against
the
wall
by
solid
iron
clamps
but
now
the
three
boxes
torn
from
their
mysterious
and
inviolable
tabernacle
lay
yawning
and
empty
in
the
middle
of
the
room
at
sight
of
these
joseph
gave
the
alarm
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
he
shouted
up
the
stairs
madame
monsieur
come
down
right
away
we
are
robbed
we
are
robbed
there
was
a
sudden
avalanche
a
frightful
plunge
down
the
stairs
madame
in
her
chemise
with
her
shoulders
scarcely
covered
by
a
light
neckkerchief
monsieur
in
his
drawers
and
shirt
and
both
of
them
dishevelled
pale
and
grimacing
as
if
they
had
been
awakened
in
the
middle
of
a
nightmare
shouted
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
we
are
robbed
we
are
robbed
we
are
robbed
what
we
are
robbed
what
in
the
madame
groaned
my
god
my
god
while
with
distorted
mouth
monsieur
continued
to
scream
we
are
robbed
what
what
guided
by
joseph
into
the
servants
hall
madame
at
sight
of
the
three
boxes
unsealed
made
a
great
gesture
uttered
a
great
cry
my
silver
service
my
god
is
it
possible
my
silver
service
and
lifting
the
empty
compartments
and
turning
the
empty
cases
upside
down
she
sank
frightened
and
horrified
upon
the
floor
scarcely
had
she
strength
enough
to
stammer
in
the
voice
of
a
child
they
have
taken
everything
they
have
taken
everything
everything
everything
everything
even
the
louis
xvi
cruet
while
madame
was
looking
at
the
boxes
as
if
she
were
looking
at
a
dead
child
monsieur
scratching
his
neck
and
rolling
haggard
eyes
moaned
persistently
in
the
voice
of
a
demented
person
name
of
a
dog
ah
name
of
a
dog
name
of
a
dog
of
name
of
a
dog
and
joseph
too
with
atrocious
grimaces
was
exclaiming
the
cruet
of
louis
xvi
the
cruet
of
louis
xvi
oh
the
bandits
then
there
was
a
minute
of
tragic
silence
a
long
minute
of
prostration
that
silence
of
death
that
prostration
of
beings
and
things
which
follows
the
fracas
of
a
terrible
downfall
the
thunder
of
a
great
cataclysm
and
the
lantern
swinging
in
joseph
hands
cast
a
red
trembling
sinister
gleam
over
the
whole
scene
over
the
dead
faces
and
the
empty
boxes
i
had
come
down
in
response
to
joseph
call
at
the
same
time
as
the
masters
in
presence
of
this
disaster
and
in
spite
of
the
prodigious
comicality
of
these
faces
my
first
feeling
was
one
of
compassion
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
misfortune
fell
upon
me
too
and
that
i
was
one
of
the
family
sharing
its
trials
and
sorrows
i
should
have
liked
to
speak
consoling
words
to
madame
whose
dejected
attitude
it
gave
me
pain
to
see
but
this
impression
of
solidarity
or
of
servitude
quickly
vanished
in
crime
there
is
something
violent
solemn
justiciary
religious
which
frightens
me
to
be
sure
but
which
also
leaves
in
me
how
shall
i
express
it
a
feeling
of
admiration
no
not
of
admiration
since
admiration
is
a
moral
feeling
a
spiritual
excitement
whereas
that
which
i
feel
influences
and
excites
only
my
flesh
it
is
like
a
brutal
shock
throughout
my
physical
being
at
once
painful
and
delicious
a
sorrowful
and
swooning
rape
of
my
sex
it
is
curious
doubtless
it
is
peculiar
perhaps
it
is
horrible
and
i
can
not
explain
the
real
cause
of
these
strange
and
powerful
sensations
but
in
me
every
crime
especially
murder
has
secret
relationships
with
love
yes
indeed
a
fine
crime
takes
hold
of
me
just
as
a
fine
man
does
i
must
say
that
further
reflection
suddenly
transformed
into
a
hilarious
gaiety
a
childish
content
that
grave
atrocious
and
powerful
enjoyment
of
crime
which
succeeded
the
impulse
to
pity
that
at
first
so
inappropriately
startled
my
heart
i
thought
here
are
two
beings
who
live
like
moles
like
larvæ
like
voluntary
prisoners
they
have
voluntarily
shut
themselves
up
in
the
jail
of
these
inhospitable
walls
all
that
constitutes
the
joy
of
life
the
smile
of
a
house
they
repress
as
something
superfluous
against
everything
that
could
excuse
their
wealth
and
pardon
their
human
uselessness
they
guard
as
they
would
guard
against
filth
they
let
nothing
fall
from
their
parsimonious
table
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
the
poor
they
let
nothing
fall
from
their
dry
hearts
to
relieve
the
pain
of
the
suffering
they
even
economize
in
making
provision
for
their
own
happiness
and
should
i
pity
them
oh
no
it
is
justice
that
has
overtaken
them
in
stripping
them
of
a
portion
of
their
goods
in
giving
air
to
the
buried
treasures
the
good
thieves
have
restored
equilibrium
what
i
regret
is
that
they
did
not
leave
these
two
maleficent
beings
totally
naked
and
miserable
more
destitute
than
the
vagabond
who
so
often
begged
at
their
door
in
vain
sicker
than
the
abandoned
creature
dying
by
the
roadside
within
two
steps
of
this
hidden
and
accursed
wealth
this
idea
of
my
masters
with
wallets
on
their
backs
having
to
drag
their
lamentable
rags
and
their
bleeding
feet
over
the
stony
highways
and
to
stand
with
outstretched
hands
at
the
implacable
threshold
of
the
rich
enchanted
me
and
filled
me
with
gaiety
but
my
gaiety
became
more
direct
and
more
intense
and
more
hateful
as
i
surveyed
madame
stranded
beside
her
empty
boxes
deader
than
if
she
had
been
really
dead
for
she
was
conscious
of
this
death
the
most
horrible
death
conceivable
to
a
being
who
had
never
loved
anything
but
the
valuation
in
money
of
those
invaluable
things
our
pleasures
our
caprices
our
charities
our
love
the
divine
luxury
of
the
soul
this
shameful
sorrow
this
crapulous
dejection
was
also
a
revenge
for
the
humiliations
and
severities
that
i
have
undergone
that
came
to
me
from
her
in
every
word
that
issued
from
her
mouth
in
every
look
that
fell
from
her
eyes
this
deliciously
grim
enjoyment
i
tasted
to
the
full
i
would
have
liked
to
cry
out
well
done
well
done
and
above
all
i
would
have
liked
to
know
these
admirable
and
sublime
thieves
in
order
to
thank
them
in
the
name
of
all
the
ragamuffins
and
to
embrace
them
as
brothers
oh
good
thieves
dear
figures
of
justice
and
pity
through
what
a
series
of
intense
and
delightful
sensations
you
have
made
me
pass
madame
was
not
slow
in
recovering
her
her
combative
aggressive
nature
suddenly
reawakened
in
all
its
violence
and
what
are
you
doing
here
she
said
to
monsieur
in
a
tone
of
anger
and
supreme
scorn
why
are
you
here
how
ridiculous
you
are
with
your
big
puffy
face
and
in
your
do
you
think
that
will
get
us
back
our
silver
service
come
shake
yourself
stir
yourself
try
to
understand
go
for
the
police
for
the
justice
of
the
peace
ought
they
not
to
have
been
here
long
ago
oh
my
god
what
a
man
monsieur
with
bent
back
started
to
go
she
interrupted
him
and
how
is
it
that
you
heard
nothing
what
they
turn
the
house
upside
down
break
in
doors
force
locks
empty
walls
and
boxes
and
you
hear
nothing
what
are
you
good
for
big
blockhead
monsieur
ventured
to
answer
but
you
too
my
pet
you
did
not
hear
anything
i
it
is
not
the
same
thing
is
it
not
a
man
business
to
hear
and
besides
you
provoke
me
clear
out
and
as
monsieur
went
to
dress
madame
turned
her
fury
upon
us
and
you
what
are
you
doing
standing
there
like
so
many
bundles
and
looking
at
me
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
i
suppose
whether
your
masters
are
plundered
or
not
and
you
too
heard
nothing
what
luck
it
is
charming
to
have
such
servants
you
think
of
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking
pack
of
brutes
that
you
are
then
addressing
joseph
directly
she
asked
why
did
the
dogs
bark
say
why
not
this
question
seemed
to
embarrass
joseph
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
but
he
quickly
recovered
himself
i
do
know
madame
said
he
in
a
most
natural
tone
it
is
true
that
the
dogs
did
bark
that
is
curious
indeed
did
you
let
them
loose
last
night
certainly
i
let
them
loose
as
i
do
every
night
that
is
curious
yes
indeed
that
is
curious
it
must
be
that
the
robbers
knew
the
house
and
the
dogs
well
joseph
how
is
it
that
you
so
devoted
and
punctual
as
a
rule
did
not
hear
anything
it
is
true
that
i
heard
nothing
that
is
another
singular
thing
for
i
do
not
sleep
soundly
if
a
cat
crosses
the
garden
i
hear
it
it
is
not
natural
all
the
same
and
those
confounded
dogs
especially
indeed
indeed
madame
interrupted
joseph
stop
leave
me
in
peace
you
are
brutes
all
of
you
and
marianne
where
is
marianne
why
is
she
here
she
is
sleeping
like
a
chump
undoubtedly
and
going
out
of
the
servants
hall
she
called
up
the
stairs
marianne
marianne
i
looked
at
joseph
who
looked
at
the
boxes
joseph
face
wore
a
grave
expression
there
was
a
sort
of
mystery
in
his
eyes
i
will
not
try
to
describe
this
day
with
all
its
varied
incidents
and
follies
the
prosecuting
attorney
summoned
by
dispatch
came
in
the
afternoon
and
began
his
investigation
joseph
marianne
and
i
were
questioned
one
after
the
other
the
first
two
for
the
sake
of
form
i
with
a
hostile
persistence
which
was
extremely
disagreeable
to
me
they
visited
my
room
and
searched
my
commode
and
my
trunks
my
correspondence
was
examined
in
detail
thanks
to
a
piece
of
good
luck
that
i
bless
the
manuscript
of
my
diary
escaped
them
a
few
days
before
the
event
i
had
sent
it
to
cléclé
from
whom
i
had
received
an
affectionate
letter
but
for
that
the
magistrates
perhaps
would
have
found
in
these
pages
a
foundation
for
a
charge
against
joseph
or
at
least
for
suspicion
of
him
i
still
tremble
at
the
thought
of
it
it
goes
without
saying
that
they
also
examined
the
garden
paths
the
platbands
the
walls
the
openings
in
the
hedges
and
the
little
yard
leading
to
the
lane
in
the
hope
of
finding
and
traces
of
but
the
ground
was
very
dry
and
hard
it
was
impossible
to
discover
the
slightest
imprint
the
slightest
clue
the
fence
the
walls
the
openings
in
the
hedges
kept
their
secret
jealously
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
outrage
in
the
woods
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
hurried
forward
asking
to
testify
one
had
seen
a
man
of
light
complexion
whose
looks
he
did
not
like
another
had
seen
a
man
of
dark
complexion
who
had
a
funny
air
in
short
the
investigation
proved
fruitless
no
scent
no
suspicion
we
shall
have
to
wait
declared
the
prosecuting
attorney
mysteriously
as
he
left
that
night
perhaps
the
paris
police
will
put
us
on
the
track
of
the
guilty
during
this
fatiguing
day
amid
the
goings
and
comings
i
had
scarcely
the
leisure
to
think
of
the
consequences
of
this
drama
which
for
the
first
time
put
a
little
animation
and
life
into
this
dismal
priory
madame
did
not
give
us
a
minute
rest
we
had
to
run
hither
and
thither
without
reason
moreover
for
madame
had
lost
her
head
a
little
as
for
marianne
she
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
anything
and
to
be
unaware
that
anything
had
happened
to
upset
the
house
like
the
sad
eugénie
she
followed
her
own
idea
and
her
own
idea
was
very
far
from
our
preoccupations
when
monsieur
appeared
in
the
kitchen
she
became
suddenly
like
one
intoxicated
and
she
looked
at
him
with
ecstatic
eyes
oh
your
big
phiz
your
big
hands
your
big
eyes
in
the
evening
after
a
silent
dinner
i
had
an
opportunity
to
reflect
the
idea
had
struck
me
immediately
and
now
it
was
fortified
within
me
that
joseph
was
not
a
stranger
to
this
bold
robbery
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
hope
that
between
his
cherbourg
trip
and
the
preparation
of
this
audacious
and
incomparably
executed
stroke
there
had
been
an
evident
connection
and
i
remembered
the
answer
he
made
to
me
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
that
depends
on
a
very
important
matter
although
he
endeavored
to
appear
natural
i
perceived
in
his
movements
in
his
attitude
in
his
silence
an
unusual
embarrassment
visible
only
to
me
i
took
so
much
satisfaction
in
this
presentiment
that
i
did
not
try
to
put
it
aside
on
the
contrary
i
felt
an
intense
joy
in
contemplating
the
idea
marianne
having
left
us
alone
a
moment
in
the
kitchen
i
approached
joseph
and
in
a
coaxing
tender
voice
moved
by
an
inexpressible
emotion
i
asked
him
tell
me
joseph
that
it
was
you
who
outraged
the
little
claire
in
the
woods
tell
me
that
it
was
you
who
stole
madame
silver
service
surprised
stupefied
by
this
question
joseph
looked
at
me
then
suddenly
without
answering
he
drew
me
to
him
and
making
my
neck
bend
under
a
kiss
that
fell
like
a
blow
of
a
club
he
said
to
me
do
talk
about
that
since
you
are
to
come
with
me
to
the
little
café
and
since
our
two
souls
are
alike
i
remember
having
seen
in
a
little
at
the
countess
fardin
a
sort
of
hindoo
idol
horribly
and
murderously
beautiful
at
this
moment
joseph
resembled
it
days
passed
and
months
naturally
the
magistrates
were
unable
to
discover
anything
and
finally
they
abandoned
the
investigation
their
opinion
was
that
the
crime
was
the
work
of
expert
burglars
from
paris
paris
has
a
broad
back
go
look
for
them
in
the
heap
this
negative
result
made
madame
indignant
she
railed
violently
at
the
magistracy
which
could
not
recover
her
silver
service
but
nevertheless
she
did
not
give
up
hope
of
finding
the
cruet
of
louis
xvi
as
joseph
called
it
every
day
she
concocted
new
and
outlandish
schemes
which
she
sent
to
the
magistrates
who
tiring
at
last
of
all
this
nonsense
did
not
even
answer
her
at
last
i
was
reassured
concerning
joseph
for
i
was
always
afraid
that
some
catastrophe
would
overtake
him
joseph
had
again
become
silent
and
devoted
the
family
servant
the
rare
pearl
i
can
not
help
puffing
with
laughter
at
the
recollection
of
a
conversation
which
on
the
very
day
of
the
robbery
i
overheard
behind
the
door
of
the
between
madame
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
a
dry
little
man
with
thin
lips
and
bilious
complexion
whose
profile
was
as
sharp
as
the
edge
of
a
sword
you
do
not
suspect
anybody
among
your
people
asked
the
prosecuting
attorney
your
coachman
joseph
cried
madame
scandalized
a
man
who
is
so
devoted
to
us
who
has
been
in
our
service
for
more
than
fifteen
years
honesty
itself
monsieur
a
pearl
he
would
throw
himself
into
the
fire
for
us
anxious
with
wrinkled
brow
she
reflected
unless
it
were
this
girl
the
chambermaid
i
do
not
know
her
perhaps
she
has
very
bad
relations
in
paris
several
times
i
have
caught
her
drinking
the
and
eating
our
prunes
a
servant
who
drinks
his
master
wine
is
capable
of
anything
and
she
murmured
one
should
never
take
servants
from
paris
she
is
singular
indeed
just
fancy
the
mean
thing
that
is
the
way
with
suspicious
people
they
suspect
everybody
save
him
who
robs
them
of
course
for
i
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
joseph
had
been
the
soul
of
this
affair
for
a
long
time
i
had
watched
him
not
from
any
hostile
feeling
as
you
may
know
but
from
curiosity
and
i
was
certain
that
this
faithful
and
devoted
servant
this
unique
pearl
was
foraging
in
the
house
for
all
he
was
worth
he
stole
oats
coal
eggs
all
sorts
of
little
things
that
could
be
sold
without
giving
any
trace
of
their
origin
and
his
friend
the
sacristan
did
not
come
to
the
in
the
evening
for
nothing
and
simply
to
discuss
the
benefits
of
being
a
circumspect
patient
prudent
methodical
man
joseph
was
not
unaware
that
petty
larcenies
committed
daily
foot
up
largely
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
i
am
persuaded
that
in
this
way
he
tripled
and
quadrupled
his
wages
a
thing
never
to
be
disdained
i
know
very
well
that
there
is
a
difference
between
these
little
thefts
and
such
an
audacious
pillage
as
that
of
the
night
of
december
that
proves
that
he
liked
also
to
work
on
the
grand
scale
how
do
i
know
that
joseph
was
not
then
a
member
of
a
gang
ah
how
i
should
have
liked
to
know
all
that
and
how
i
should
like
to
know
it
still
after
the
evening
when
he
gave
me
the
kiss
that
to
me
was
equivalent
to
a
confession
of
the
crime
when
his
confidence
went
out
to
me
in
a
moment
of
passion
joseph
steadily
denied
in
vain
did
i
turn
him
this
way
and
that
set
traps
for
him
and
wheedle
him
with
soft
words
and
caresses
he
would
not
contradict
himself
and
he
entered
into
the
madness
of
madame
hopes
he
too
concocted
schemes
and
tried
to
imagine
the
robbery
in
all
its
details
and
he
beat
the
dogs
that
did
not
bark
and
he
threatened
with
his
fist
the
unknown
thieves
the
chimerical
thieves
as
if
he
saw
them
running
at
the
horizon
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
about
this
impenetrable
man
one
day
i
believed
him
guilty
another
day
i
believed
him
innocent
and
it
was
horribly
provoking
we
met
again
in
the
in
the
evening
as
before
well
joseph
ah
it
is
you
célestine
why
do
you
speak
to
me
any
more
you
seem
to
shun
me
shun
you
i
oh
heavens
yes
since
that
famous
morning
do
talk
of
that
célestine
you
have
too
bad
ideas
and
he
sadly
wagged
his
head
come
joseph
you
know
that
i
do
that
for
fun
would
i
love
you
if
you
had
committed
such
a
crime
my
little
joseph
yes
yes
you
are
trying
to
wheedle
me
it
is
not
well
and
when
are
we
to
start
i
can
not
live
here
any
longer
not
directly
we
must
wait
awhile
but
why
because
that
can
not
be
done
at
once
a
little
piqued
i
said
in
a
tone
of
slight
anger
it
is
not
nice
of
you
you
evidently
are
in
no
hurry
for
me
i
cried
joseph
with
ardent
grimaces
why
i
am
crazy
over
you
well
then
let
us
start
but
he
was
obstinate
refusing
to
explain
further
no
no
that
can
not
be
done
yet
very
naturally
i
reflected
he
is
right
after
all
if
he
has
stolen
the
silver
service
he
can
not
go
away
now
or
set
up
in
business
perhaps
it
would
awaken
suspicion
some
time
must
be
allowed
to
pass
so
that
this
mysterious
affair
may
be
forgotten
another
evening
i
proposed
listen
my
little
joseph
i
know
a
way
of
leaving
here
we
could
get
up
a
quarrel
with
madame
and
force
her
to
discharge
us
both
but
he
protested
sharply
no
no
he
exclaimed
none
of
that
célestine
no
indeed
for
my
part
i
love
my
masters
they
are
good
masters
we
must
part
with
them
on
good
terms
we
must
go
away
from
here
like
worthy
people
like
serious
people
the
masters
must
be
sorry
to
have
us
leave
they
must
weep
to
see
us
go
with
a
sad
gravity
in
which
i
perceived
no
trace
of
irony
he
declared
i
you
know
shall
be
greatly
grieved
at
leaving
here
i
have
been
here
for
fifteen
years
one
gets
attached
to
a
house
in
that
time
and
you
célestine
will
it
give
you
no
pain
oh
no
i
shouted
laughing
it
is
not
well
it
is
not
well
one
should
love
one
masters
masters
are
masters
and
let
me
give
you
some
advice
be
very
nice
very
gentle
very
devoted
do
your
work
well
do
talk
back
in
short
célestine
we
must
leave
on
good
terms
with
them
with
madame
especially
i
followed
joseph
advice
and
during
the
months
that
we
had
to
remain
at
the
priory
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
be
a
model
chambermaid
that
i
would
be
a
pearl
too
i
lavished
upon
them
all
my
intelligence
all
my
willingness
all
my
delicacy
madame
became
human
with
me
little
by
little
she
became
really
my
friend
i
do
not
think
it
was
my
care
alone
that
brought
about
this
change
in
madame
character
madame
pride
and
even
her
reasons
for
living
had
received
a
blow
as
after
some
great
sorrow
after
the
overwhelming
loss
of
some
cherished
darling
she
no
longer
struggled
but
gently
and
plaintively
abandoned
herself
to
the
dejection
of
her
conquered
nerves
and
her
humiliated
pride
seeming
to
seek
from
those
about
her
only
consolation
pity
and
confidence
the
hell
of
the
priory
was
transformed
for
everybody
into
a
real
paradise
it
was
in
the
height
of
this
family
peace
of
this
domestic
calm
that
i
announced
one
morning
to
madame
that
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
her
i
invented
a
romantic
story
i
was
to
return
to
my
native
province
there
to
marry
a
worthy
fellow
who
had
long
been
waiting
for
me
in
words
of
tenderness
i
expressed
my
pain
my
regrets
my
appreciation
of
madame
kindness
etc
madame
was
overwhelmed
she
tried
to
keep
me
by
appealing
to
my
sentiments
and
to
my
interest
she
offered
to
increase
my
wages
and
to
give
me
a
fine
room
on
the
second
floor
but
finding
me
determined
she
had
to
be
resigned
i
have
become
so
accustomed
to
you
now
she
sighed
ah
i
have
no
luck
but
it
was
much
worse
when
a
week
later
joseph
came
in
his
turn
to
explain
that
being
too
old
and
tired
he
could
no
longer
continue
his
service
and
must
seek
the
rest
that
he
needed
you
joseph
cried
madame
you
too
it
is
not
possible
a
curse
must
have
fallen
on
the
priory
everybody
abandons
me
everything
abandons
me
madame
wept
joseph
wept
monsieur
wept
marianne
wept
you
take
with
you
all
our
regrets
joseph
alas
he
took
not
only
regrets
he
took
also
the
silver
service
once
away
i
was
much
perplexed
i
had
no
scruple
about
enjoying
joseph
money
the
stolen
money
no
it
was
not
that
where
is
the
money
that
is
not
stolen
but
i
feared
lest
my
feeling
might
prove
only
a
fleeting
curiosity
joseph
had
acquired
over
me
over
my
mind
as
well
as
my
flesh
an
ascendency
that
perhaps
would
not
last
and
perhaps
it
was
only
a
momentary
perversion
of
my
senses
there
were
moments
too
when
i
asked
myself
if
it
was
not
my
imagination
carried
to
the
heights
of
exceptional
dreams
which
had
created
joseph
as
i
saw
him
if
really
he
was
anything
more
than
a
simple
brute
a
peasant
incapable
even
of
a
fine
act
of
violence
of
a
fine
crime
the
consequences
of
this
act
frightened
me
and
then
is
it
not
really
inexplicable
this
idea
that
i
was
no
longer
to
be
in
the
service
of
others
caused
me
some
regret
formerly
i
thought
that
i
should
welcome
the
news
of
my
liberty
with
great
joy
well
no
through
being
a
domestic
one
gets
it
into
his
blood
suppose
i
should
suddenly
miss
the
spectacle
of
luxury
i
foresaw
my
own
little
interior
severe
and
cold
like
a
workman
interior
my
mediocre
life
deprived
of
all
these
pretty
things
of
all
these
pretty
stuffs
so
soft
to
the
touch
of
all
these
pretty
vices
which
it
was
my
pleasure
to
serve
to
dress
to
adorn
to
plunge
into
as
into
a
perfumed
bath
but
it
was
too
late
to
draw
back
ah
who
could
have
told
me
on
the
gray
sad
and
rainy
day
on
which
i
arrived
at
the
priory
that
i
would
end
with
this
strange
silent
and
crusty
man
who
looked
at
me
with
such
disdain
now
we
are
in
the
little
café
joseph
has
grown
young
again
he
is
no
longer
bent
and
clumsy
and
he
walks
from
one
table
to
another
and
he
runs
from
one
room
to
the
other
with
supple
leg
and
elastic
spine
his
shoulders
which
so
frightened
me
have
taken
on
good
nature
his
neck
sometimes
so
terrible
has
something
about
it
that
is
fraternal
and
restful
always
freshly
shaven
with
skin
as
dark
and
shining
as
mahogany
with
a
skull
cap
on
his
head
and
wearing
a
blue
and
very
clean
woollen
shirt
he
has
the
air
of
an
old
sailor
of
an
old
who
has
seen
extraordinary
things
and
passed
through
extravagant
countries
what
i
admire
in
him
is
his
moral
tranquillity
there
is
no
longer
any
anxiety
in
his
look
one
sees
that
his
life
rests
on
solid
foundations
more
violently
than
ever
he
is
for
the
family
for
property
for
religion
for
the
navy
for
the
army
for
the
country
he
astonishes
me
when
we
married
joseph
gave
me
a
marriage
portion
of
ten
thousand
francs
the
other
day
the
maritime
commissary
knocked
down
to
him
at
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
lot
of
wreckage
for
which
he
paid
cash
and
which
he
has
sold
again
at
a
big
profit
he
also
does
a
little
banking
business
that
is
he
lends
money
to
fishermen
and
already
he
is
thinking
of
branching
out
by
taking
the
next
house
perhaps
we
shall
start
a
there
it
puzzles
me
that
he
has
so
much
money
and
how
much
is
his
fortune
i
do
not
know
he
does
not
like
me
to
talk
to
him
about
that
he
does
not
like
me
to
talk
to
him
about
the
time
that
we
were
servants
one
would
say
that
he
has
forgotten
everything
and
that
his
life
really
began
only
on
the
day
when
he
took
possession
of
the
little
café
when
i
ask
him
a
question
that
torments
me
he
seems
not
to
understand
what
i
say
and
then
terrible
gleams
flash
through
his
eyes
as
they
used
to
do
never
shall
i
know
anything
of
joseph
never
shall
i
know
the
mystery
of
his
life
and
perhaps
it
is
this
mystery
which
so
attaches
me
to
him
joseph
looks
out
for
everything
in
the
house
and
there
is
no
hitch
anywhere
we
have
three
waiters
to
serve
the
customers
a
for
the
kitchen
and
the
household
and
everything
goes
as
to
the
beat
of
a
magic
wand
it
is
true
that
in
three
months
we
have
changed
our
servant
four
times
how
exacting
these
cherbourg
servants
are
how
thieving
and
how
shameless
no
it
is
incredible
and
it
is
disgusting
as
for
me
i
superintend
the
cash
enthroned
behind
the
bar
amid
a
forest
of
colored
bottles
i
am
there
also
on
show
and
to
chat
joseph
wishes
me
to
be
finely
arrayed
he
never
refuses
me
anything
for
the
adornment
of
my
person
and
he
likes
me
to
show
my
skin
in
the
evening
in
a
tantalizing
dress
somewhat
low
in
the
neck
it
is
necessary
to
excite
the
customer
to
keep
him
in
a
state
of
constant
joy
of
constant
desire
there
are
already
two
or
three
fat
quartermasters
two
or
three
engineers
of
the
squadron
very
well
fixed
who
pay
me
assiduous
court
naturally
to
please
me
they
spend
a
good
deal
joseph
spoils
them
especially
for
they
are
terrible
drinkers
we
have
also
taken
four
boarders
they
eat
with
us
and
every
evening
pay
for
wine
and
cordials
which
all
hands
drink
they
are
very
gallant
with
me
and
i
do
my
best
to
excite
them
but
i
am
careful
not
to
let
my
manners
go
farther
than
the
encouragement
of
commonplace
ogling
equivocal
smiles
and
illusory
promises
moreover
i
have
no
intentions
joseph
is
enough
for
me
and
i
really
think
i
should
suffer
by
the
change
even
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
deceive
him
with
the
admiral
it
is
really
funny
ugly
as
he
is
nobody
is
as
handsome
as
my
joseph
oh
the
old
monster
what
a
hold
he
has
taken
on
me
and
to
think
that
he
has
always
lived
in
the
country
and
has
been
all
his
life
a
peasant
but
where
joseph
especially
triumphs
is
in
politics
thanks
to
him
the
little
café
whose
sign
to
the
french
army
shines
over
the
whole
neighborhood
in
big
letters
of
gold
by
day
in
big
letters
of
fire
by
night
is
now
the
official
rendezvous
of
the
conspicuous
and
the
noisiest
patriots
of
the
town
these
come
here
to
fraternize
in
heroic
sprees
with
of
the
army
and
officers
of
the
navy
there
have
already
been
some
bloody
fights
and
several
times
apropos
of
nothing
the
have
drawn
their
swords
threatening
to
kill
imaginary
traitors
the
night
that
dreyfus
landed
in
france
i
thought
that
the
little
café
would
tumble
down
under
the
cries
of
long
live
the
army
and
death
to
the
jews
that
night
joseph
who
is
already
popular
in
the
town
had
a
mad
success
he
mounted
a
table
and
shouted
if
the
traitor
is
guilty
let
him
be
sent
back
if
he
is
innocent
let
him
be
shot
on
every
hand
they
shouted
yes
yes
let
him
be
shot
long
live
the
army
this
proposition
had
carried
the
enthusiasm
to
the
height
of
paroxysm
above
the
shouting
in
the
café
could
be
heard
only
the
clashing
of
swords
and
the
pounding
of
fists
on
the
marble
tables
some
one
having
ventured
to
say
nobody
knows
what
was
hooted
and
joseph
rushing
upon
him
smashed
his
mouth
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
and
broke
five
teeth
for
him
struck
repeatedly
with
the
flat
of
a
sword
torn
covered
with
blood
and
half
dead
the
unfortunate
man
was
cast
like
so
much
filth
into
the
street
always
to
the
cries
of
long
live
the
army
death
to
the
jews
there
are
moments
when
i
am
afraid
in
this
atmosphere
of
debauchery
among
all
these
bestial
faces
heavy
with
alcohol
and
murder
but
joseph
reassures
me
that
nothing
he
says
that
is
good
for
business
yesterday
coming
back
from
the
market
joseph
announced
gaily
rubbing
his
hands
bad
news
there
is
talk
of
a
war
with
england
oh
my
god
i
cried
suppose
cherbourg
should
be
bombarded
pooh
pooh
sneered
joseph
only
i
have
thought
of
something
i
have
thought
of
a
stroke
a
rich
stroke
in
spite
of
myself
i
shuddered
he
must
be
contemplating
some
immense
rascality
the
more
i
look
at
you
he
said
the
more
i
say
to
myself
that
you
have
not
the
head
of
a
breton
oh
no
you
have
not
the
head
of
a
breton
you
have
rather
an
alsatian
head
hey
that
would
make
a
fine
show
behind
the
bar
i
was
disappointed
i
thought
that
joseph
was
going
to
propose
some
terrible
thing
i
was
proud
already
at
the
thought
of
being
admitted
to
partnership
in
a
bold
undertaking
whenever
i
see
him
in
reflective
mood
my
ideas
are
immediately
inflamed
i
imagine
tragedies
nocturnal
wallscalings
robberies
drawn
knives
people
in
the
agony
of
death
on
the
forest
heath
and
it
was
nothing
but
a
petty
and
vulgar
piece
of
advertising
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
blue
on
his
head
he
swayed
to
and
fro
in
a
droll
fashion
do
you
understand
he
insisted
at
the
outbreak
of
a
war
a
very
pretty
alsatian
finely
dressed
would
inflame
hearts
and
excite
patriotism
and
there
is
nothing
like
patriotism
to
get
people
drunk
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
would
put
you
in
the
newspapers
and
perhaps
even
on
posters
i
prefer
to
remain
in
the
costume
of
a
lady
i
answered
a
little
dryly
thereupon
we
began
to
quarrel
and
for
the
first
time
we
came
to
violent
words
you
did
not
put
on
so
many
airs
when
you
were
intimate
with
everybody
cried
joseph
and
you
when
you
oh
you
had
better
let
me
alone
because
i
could
say
too
much
strumpet
thief
a
customer
came
in
the
discussion
ceased
and
at
night
there
was
a
reconciliation
with
kisses
i
am
going
to
have
a
pretty
alsatian
costume
made
for
me
of
silk
and
velvet
really
i
am
powerless
against
joseph
will
in
spite
of
this
little
fit
of
revolt
joseph
holds
me
possesses
me
like
a
demon
and
i
am
happy
in
being
his
i
feel
that
i
shall
do
whatever
he
wishes
me
to
do
and
that
i
shall
go
wherever
he
tells
me
to
go
even
to
crime
