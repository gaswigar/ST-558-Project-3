part
one
chapter
i
in
the
days
when
the
hummed
busily
in
the
farmhouses
and
even
great
ladies
clothed
in
silk
and
had
their
toy
of
polished
oak
there
might
be
seen
in
districts
far
away
among
the
lanes
or
deep
in
the
bosom
of
the
hills
certain
pallid
undersized
men
who
by
the
side
of
the
brawny
looked
like
the
remnants
of
a
disinherited
race
the
shepherd
dog
barked
fiercely
when
one
of
these
men
appeared
on
the
upland
dark
against
the
early
winter
sunset
for
what
dog
likes
a
figure
bent
under
a
heavy
bag
and
these
pale
men
rarely
stirred
abroad
without
that
mysterious
burden
the
shepherd
himself
though
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
bag
held
nothing
but
flaxen
thread
or
else
the
long
rolls
of
strong
linen
spun
from
that
thread
was
not
quite
sure
that
this
trade
of
weaving
indispensable
though
it
was
could
be
carried
on
entirely
without
the
help
of
the
evil
one
in
that
time
superstition
clung
easily
round
every
person
or
thing
that
was
at
all
unwonted
or
even
intermittent
and
occasional
merely
like
the
visits
of
the
pedlar
or
the
no
one
knew
where
wandering
men
had
their
homes
or
their
origin
and
how
was
a
man
to
be
explained
unless
you
at
least
knew
somebody
who
knew
his
father
and
mother
to
the
peasants
of
old
times
the
world
outside
their
own
direct
experience
was
a
region
of
vagueness
and
mystery
to
their
untravelled
thought
a
state
of
wandering
was
a
conception
as
dim
as
the
winter
life
of
the
swallows
that
came
back
with
the
spring
and
even
a
settler
if
he
came
from
distant
parts
hardly
ever
ceased
to
be
viewed
with
a
remnant
of
distrust
which
would
have
prevented
any
surprise
if
a
long
course
of
inoffensive
conduct
on
his
part
had
ended
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
especially
if
he
had
any
reputation
for
knowledge
or
showed
any
skill
in
handicraft
all
cleverness
whether
in
the
rapid
use
of
that
difficult
instrument
the
tongue
or
in
some
other
art
unfamiliar
to
villagers
was
in
itself
suspicious
honest
folk
born
and
bred
in
a
visible
manner
were
mostly
not
overwise
or
clever
at
least
not
beyond
such
a
matter
as
knowing
the
signs
of
the
weather
and
the
process
by
which
rapidity
and
dexterity
of
any
kind
were
acquired
was
so
wholly
hidden
that
they
partook
of
the
nature
of
conjuring
in
this
way
it
came
to
pass
that
those
scattered
emigrants
from
the
town
into
the
country
were
to
the
last
regarded
as
aliens
by
their
rustic
neighbours
and
usually
contracted
the
eccentric
habits
which
belong
to
a
state
of
loneliness
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
such
a
named
silas
marner
worked
at
his
vocation
in
a
stone
cottage
that
stood
among
the
nutty
hedgerows
near
the
village
of
raveloe
and
not
far
from
the
edge
of
a
deserted
the
questionable
sound
of
silas
loom
so
unlike
the
natural
cheerful
trotting
of
the
or
the
simpler
rhythm
of
the
flail
had
a
fascination
for
the
raveloe
boys
who
would
often
leave
off
their
nutting
or
to
peep
in
at
the
window
of
the
stone
cottage
counterbalancing
a
certain
awe
at
the
mysterious
action
of
the
loom
by
a
pleasant
sense
of
scornful
superiority
drawn
from
the
mockery
of
its
alternating
noises
along
with
the
bent
attitude
of
the
weaver
but
sometimes
it
happened
that
marner
pausing
to
adjust
an
irregularity
in
his
thread
became
aware
of
the
small
scoundrels
and
though
chary
of
his
time
he
liked
their
intrusion
so
ill
that
he
would
descend
from
his
loom
and
opening
the
door
would
fix
on
them
a
gaze
that
was
always
enough
to
make
them
take
to
their
legs
in
terror
for
how
was
it
possible
to
believe
that
those
large
brown
protuberant
eyes
in
silas
marner
pale
face
really
saw
nothing
very
distinctly
that
was
not
close
to
them
and
not
rather
that
their
dreadful
stare
could
dart
cramp
or
rickets
or
a
wry
mouth
at
any
boy
who
happened
to
be
in
the
rear
they
had
perhaps
heard
their
fathers
and
mothers
hint
that
silas
marner
could
cure
folks
rheumatism
if
he
had
a
mind
and
add
still
more
darkly
that
if
you
could
only
speak
the
devil
fair
enough
he
might
save
you
the
cost
of
the
doctor
such
strange
lingering
echoes
of
the
old
might
perhaps
even
now
be
caught
by
the
diligent
listener
among
the
peasantry
for
the
rude
mind
with
difficulty
associates
the
ideas
of
power
and
benignity
a
shadowy
conception
of
power
that
by
much
persuasion
can
be
induced
to
refrain
from
inflicting
harm
is
the
shape
most
easily
taken
by
the
sense
of
the
invisible
in
the
minds
of
men
who
have
always
been
pressed
close
by
primitive
wants
and
to
whom
a
life
of
hard
toil
has
never
been
illuminated
by
any
enthusiastic
religious
faith
to
them
pain
and
mishap
present
a
far
wider
range
of
possibilities
than
gladness
and
enjoyment
their
imagination
is
almost
barren
of
the
images
that
feed
desire
and
hope
but
is
all
overgrown
by
recollections
that
are
a
perpetual
pasture
to
fear
is
there
anything
you
can
fancy
that
you
would
like
to
eat
i
once
said
to
an
old
labouring
man
who
was
in
his
last
illness
and
who
had
refused
all
the
food
his
wife
had
offered
him
no
he
answered
i
never
been
used
to
nothing
but
common
victual
and
i
ca
eat
that
experience
had
bred
no
fancies
in
him
that
could
raise
the
phantasm
of
appetite
and
raveloe
was
a
village
where
many
of
the
old
echoes
lingered
undrowned
by
new
voices
not
that
it
was
one
of
those
barren
parishes
lying
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
inhabited
by
meagre
sheep
and
shepherds
on
the
contrary
it
lay
in
the
rich
central
plain
of
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
merry
england
and
held
farms
which
speaking
from
a
spiritual
point
of
view
paid
tithes
but
it
was
nestled
in
a
snug
hollow
quite
an
hour
journey
on
horseback
from
any
turnpike
where
it
was
never
reached
by
the
vibrations
of
the
or
of
public
opinion
it
was
an
village
with
a
fine
old
church
and
large
churchyard
in
the
heart
of
it
and
two
or
three
large
homesteads
with
orchards
and
ornamental
weathercocks
standing
close
upon
the
road
and
lifting
more
imposing
fronts
than
the
rectory
which
peeped
from
among
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
a
village
which
showed
at
once
the
summits
of
its
social
life
and
told
the
practised
eye
that
there
was
no
great
park
and
in
the
vicinity
but
that
there
were
several
chiefs
in
raveloe
who
could
farm
badly
quite
at
their
ease
drawing
enough
money
from
their
bad
farming
in
those
war
times
to
live
in
a
rollicking
fashion
and
keep
a
jolly
christmas
whitsun
and
easter
tide
it
was
fifteen
years
since
silas
marner
had
first
come
to
raveloe
he
was
then
simply
a
pallid
young
man
with
prominent
brown
eyes
whose
appearance
would
have
had
nothing
strange
for
people
of
average
culture
and
experience
but
for
the
villagers
near
whom
he
had
come
to
settle
it
had
mysterious
peculiarities
which
corresponded
with
the
exceptional
nature
of
his
occupation
and
his
advent
from
an
unknown
region
called
so
had
his
way
of
life
he
invited
no
comer
to
step
across
his
and
he
never
strolled
into
the
village
to
drink
a
pint
at
the
rainbow
or
to
gossip
at
the
wheelwright
he
sought
no
man
or
woman
save
for
the
purposes
of
his
calling
or
in
order
to
supply
himself
with
necessaries
and
it
was
soon
clear
to
the
raveloe
lasses
that
he
would
never
urge
one
of
them
to
accept
him
against
her
will
quite
as
if
he
had
heard
them
declare
that
they
would
never
marry
a
dead
man
come
to
life
again
this
view
of
marner
personality
was
not
without
another
ground
than
his
pale
face
and
unexampled
eyes
for
jem
rodney
the
averred
that
one
evening
as
he
was
returning
homeward
he
saw
silas
marner
leaning
against
a
stile
with
a
heavy
bag
on
his
back
instead
of
resting
the
bag
on
the
stile
as
a
man
in
his
senses
would
have
done
and
that
on
coming
up
to
him
he
saw
that
marner
eyes
were
set
like
a
dead
man
and
he
spoke
to
him
and
shook
him
and
his
limbs
were
stiff
and
his
hands
clutched
the
bag
as
if
they
been
made
of
iron
but
just
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
weaver
was
dead
he
came
all
right
again
like
as
you
might
say
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
and
said
and
walked
off
all
this
jem
swore
he
had
seen
more
by
token
that
it
was
the
very
day
he
had
been
on
squire
cass
land
down
by
the
old
some
said
marner
must
have
been
in
a
fit
a
word
which
seemed
to
explain
things
otherwise
incredible
but
the
argumentative
macey
clerk
of
the
parish
shook
his
head
and
asked
if
anybody
was
ever
known
to
go
off
in
a
fit
and
not
fall
down
a
fit
was
a
stroke
was
it
and
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
stroke
to
partly
take
away
the
use
of
a
man
limbs
and
throw
him
on
the
parish
if
he
got
no
children
to
look
to
no
no
it
was
no
stroke
that
would
let
a
man
stand
on
his
legs
like
a
horse
between
the
shafts
and
then
walk
off
as
soon
as
you
can
say
gee
but
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
a
man
soul
being
loose
from
his
body
and
going
out
and
in
like
a
bird
out
of
its
nest
and
back
and
that
was
how
folks
got
for
they
went
to
school
in
this
state
to
those
who
could
teach
them
more
than
their
neighbours
could
learn
with
their
five
senses
and
the
parson
and
where
did
master
marner
get
his
knowledge
of
herbs
from
and
charms
too
if
he
liked
to
give
them
away
jem
rodney
story
was
no
more
than
what
might
have
been
expected
by
anybody
who
had
seen
how
marner
had
cured
sally
oates
and
made
her
sleep
like
a
baby
when
her
heart
had
been
beating
enough
to
burst
her
body
for
two
months
and
more
while
she
had
been
under
the
doctor
care
he
might
cure
more
folks
if
he
would
but
he
was
worth
speaking
fair
if
it
was
only
to
keep
him
from
doing
you
a
mischief
it
was
partly
to
this
vague
fear
that
marner
was
indebted
for
protecting
him
from
the
persecution
that
his
singularities
might
have
drawn
upon
him
but
still
more
to
the
fact
that
the
old
in
the
neighbouring
parish
of
tarley
being
dead
his
handicraft
made
him
a
highly
welcome
settler
to
the
richer
housewives
of
the
district
and
even
to
the
more
provident
cottagers
who
had
their
little
stock
of
yarn
at
the
year
end
their
sense
of
his
usefulness
would
have
counteracted
any
repugnance
or
suspicion
which
was
not
confirmed
by
a
deficiency
in
the
quality
or
the
tale
of
the
cloth
he
wove
for
them
and
the
years
had
rolled
on
without
producing
any
change
in
the
impressions
of
the
neighbours
concerning
marner
except
the
change
from
novelty
to
habit
at
the
end
of
fifteen
years
the
raveloe
men
said
just
the
same
things
about
silas
marner
as
at
the
beginning
they
did
not
say
them
quite
so
often
but
they
believed
them
much
more
strongly
when
they
did
say
them
there
was
only
one
important
addition
which
the
years
had
brought
it
was
that
master
marner
had
laid
by
a
fine
sight
of
money
somewhere
and
that
he
could
buy
up
bigger
men
than
himself
but
while
opinion
concerning
him
had
remained
nearly
stationary
and
his
daily
habits
had
presented
scarcely
any
visible
change
inward
life
had
been
a
history
and
a
metamorphosis
as
that
of
every
fervid
nature
must
be
when
it
has
fled
or
been
condemned
to
solitude
his
life
before
he
came
to
raveloe
had
been
filled
with
the
movement
the
mental
activity
and
the
close
fellowship
which
in
that
day
as
in
this
marked
the
life
of
an
artisan
early
incorporated
in
a
narrow
religious
sect
where
the
poorest
layman
has
the
chance
of
distinguishing
himself
by
gifts
of
speech
and
has
at
the
very
least
the
weight
of
a
silent
voter
in
the
government
of
his
community
marner
was
highly
thought
of
in
that
little
hidden
world
known
to
itself
as
the
church
assembling
in
lantern
yard
he
was
believed
to
be
a
young
man
of
exemplary
life
and
ardent
faith
and
a
peculiar
interest
had
been
centred
in
him
ever
since
he
had
fallen
at
a
into
a
mysterious
rigidity
and
suspension
of
consciousness
which
lasting
for
an
hour
or
more
had
been
mistaken
for
death
to
have
sought
a
medical
explanation
for
this
phenomenon
would
have
been
held
by
silas
himself
as
well
as
by
his
minister
and
a
wilful
from
the
spiritual
significance
that
might
lie
therein
silas
was
evidently
a
brother
selected
for
a
peculiar
discipline
and
though
the
effort
to
interpret
this
discipline
was
discouraged
by
the
absence
on
his
part
of
any
spiritual
vision
during
his
outward
trance
yet
it
was
believed
by
himself
and
others
that
its
effect
was
seen
in
an
accession
of
light
and
fervour
a
less
truthful
man
than
he
might
have
been
tempted
into
the
subsequent
creation
of
a
vision
in
the
form
of
resurgent
memory
a
less
sane
man
might
have
believed
in
such
a
creation
but
silas
was
both
sane
and
honest
though
as
with
many
honest
and
fervent
men
culture
had
not
defined
any
channels
for
his
sense
of
mystery
and
so
it
spread
itself
over
the
proper
pathway
of
inquiry
and
knowledge
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
some
acquaintance
with
medicinal
herbs
and
their
preparation
a
little
store
of
wisdom
which
she
had
imparted
to
him
as
a
solemn
bequest
but
of
late
years
he
had
had
doubts
about
the
lawfulness
of
applying
this
knowledge
believing
that
herbs
could
have
no
efficacy
without
prayer
and
that
prayer
might
suffice
without
herbs
so
that
the
inherited
delight
he
had
in
wandering
in
the
fields
in
search
of
foxglove
and
dandelion
and
coltsfoot
began
to
wear
to
him
the
character
of
a
temptation
among
the
members
of
his
church
there
was
one
young
man
a
little
older
than
himself
with
whom
he
had
long
lived
in
such
close
friendship
that
it
was
the
custom
of
their
lantern
yard
brethren
to
call
them
david
and
jonathan
the
real
name
of
the
friend
was
william
dane
and
he
too
was
regarded
as
a
shining
instance
of
youthful
piety
though
somewhat
given
to
towards
weaker
brethren
and
to
be
so
dazzled
by
his
own
light
as
to
hold
himself
wiser
than
his
teachers
but
whatever
blemishes
others
might
discern
in
william
to
his
friend
mind
he
was
faultless
for
marner
had
one
of
those
impressible
natures
which
at
an
inexperienced
age
admire
imperativeness
and
lean
on
contradiction
the
expression
of
trusting
simplicity
in
face
heightened
by
that
absence
of
special
observation
that
defenceless
gaze
which
belongs
to
large
prominent
eyes
was
strongly
contrasted
by
the
suppression
of
inward
triumph
that
lurked
in
the
narrow
slanting
eyes
and
compressed
lips
of
william
dane
one
of
the
most
frequent
topics
of
conversation
between
the
two
friends
was
assurance
of
salvation
silas
confessed
that
he
could
never
arrive
at
anything
higher
than
hope
mingled
with
fear
and
listened
with
longing
wonder
when
william
declared
that
he
had
possessed
unshaken
assurance
ever
since
in
the
period
of
his
conversion
he
had
dreamed
that
he
saw
the
words
calling
and
election
sure
standing
by
themselves
on
a
white
page
in
the
open
bible
such
colloquies
have
occupied
many
a
pair
of
weavers
whose
unnurtured
souls
have
been
like
young
winged
things
fluttering
forsaken
in
the
twilight
it
had
seemed
to
the
unsuspecting
silas
that
the
friendship
had
suffered
no
chill
even
from
his
formation
of
another
attachment
of
a
closer
kind
for
some
months
he
had
been
engaged
to
a
young
waiting
only
for
a
little
increase
to
their
mutual
savings
in
order
to
their
marriage
and
it
was
a
great
delight
to
him
that
sarah
did
not
object
to
william
occasional
presence
in
their
sunday
interviews
it
was
at
this
point
in
their
history
that
cataleptic
fit
occurred
during
the
and
amidst
the
various
queries
and
expressions
of
interest
addressed
to
him
by
his
william
suggestion
alone
jarred
with
the
general
sympathy
towards
a
brother
thus
singled
out
for
special
dealings
he
observed
that
to
him
this
trance
looked
more
like
a
visitation
of
satan
than
a
proof
of
divine
favour
and
exhorted
his
friend
to
see
that
he
hid
no
accursed
thing
within
his
soul
silas
feeling
bound
to
accept
rebuke
and
admonition
as
a
brotherly
office
felt
no
resentment
but
only
pain
at
his
friend
doubts
concerning
him
and
to
this
was
soon
added
some
anxiety
at
the
perception
that
sarah
manner
towards
him
began
to
exhibit
a
strange
fluctuation
between
an
effort
at
an
increased
manifestation
of
regard
and
involuntary
signs
of
shrinking
and
dislike
he
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
break
off
their
engagement
but
she
denied
this
their
engagement
was
known
to
the
church
and
had
been
recognized
in
the
it
could
not
be
broken
off
without
strict
investigation
and
sarah
could
render
no
reason
that
would
be
sanctioned
by
the
feeling
of
the
community
at
this
time
the
senior
deacon
was
taken
dangerously
ill
and
being
a
childless
widower
he
was
tended
night
and
day
by
some
of
the
younger
brethren
or
sisters
silas
frequently
took
his
turn
in
the
with
william
the
one
relieving
the
other
at
two
in
the
morning
the
old
man
contrary
to
expectation
seemed
to
be
on
the
way
to
recovery
when
one
night
silas
sitting
up
by
his
bedside
observed
that
his
usual
audible
breathing
had
ceased
the
candle
was
burning
low
and
he
had
to
lift
it
to
see
the
patient
face
distinctly
examination
convinced
him
that
the
deacon
was
dead
had
been
dead
some
time
for
the
limbs
were
rigid
silas
asked
himself
if
he
had
been
asleep
and
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
already
four
in
the
morning
how
was
it
that
william
had
not
come
in
much
anxiety
he
went
to
seek
for
help
and
soon
there
were
several
friends
assembled
in
the
house
the
minister
among
them
while
silas
went
away
to
his
work
wishing
he
could
have
met
william
to
know
the
reason
of
his
but
at
six
as
he
was
thinking
of
going
to
seek
his
friend
william
came
and
with
him
the
minister
they
came
to
summon
him
to
lantern
yard
to
meet
the
church
members
there
and
to
his
inquiry
concerning
the
cause
of
the
summons
the
only
reply
was
you
will
hear
nothing
further
was
said
until
silas
was
seated
in
the
vestry
in
front
of
the
minister
with
the
eyes
of
those
who
to
him
represented
god
people
fixed
solemnly
upon
him
then
the
minister
taking
out
a
showed
it
to
silas
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
he
had
left
that
knife
silas
said
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
left
it
anywhere
out
of
his
own
pocket
but
he
was
trembling
at
this
strange
interrogation
he
was
then
exhorted
not
to
hide
his
sin
but
to
confess
and
repent
the
knife
had
been
found
in
the
bureau
by
the
departed
deacon
bedside
found
in
the
place
where
the
little
bag
of
church
money
had
lain
which
the
minister
himself
had
seen
the
day
before
some
hand
had
removed
that
bag
and
whose
hand
could
it
be
if
not
that
of
the
man
to
whom
the
knife
belonged
for
some
time
silas
was
mute
with
astonishment
then
he
said
god
will
clear
me
i
know
nothing
about
the
knife
being
there
or
the
money
being
gone
search
me
and
my
dwelling
you
will
find
nothing
but
three
pound
five
of
my
own
savings
which
william
dane
knows
i
have
had
these
six
months
at
this
william
groaned
but
the
minister
said
the
proof
is
heavy
against
you
brother
marner
the
money
was
taken
in
the
night
last
past
and
no
man
was
with
our
departed
brother
but
you
for
william
dane
declares
to
us
that
he
was
hindered
by
sudden
sickness
from
going
to
take
his
place
as
usual
and
you
yourself
said
that
he
had
not
come
and
moreover
you
neglected
the
dead
body
i
must
have
slept
said
silas
then
after
a
pause
he
added
or
i
must
have
had
another
visitation
like
that
which
you
have
all
seen
me
under
so
that
the
thief
must
have
come
and
gone
while
i
was
not
in
the
body
but
out
of
the
body
but
i
say
again
search
me
and
my
dwelling
for
i
have
been
nowhere
else
the
search
was
made
and
it
ended
in
william
dane
finding
the
bag
empty
tucked
behind
the
chest
of
drawers
in
chamber
on
this
william
exhorted
his
friend
to
confess
and
not
to
hide
his
sin
any
longer
silas
turned
a
look
of
keen
reproach
on
him
and
said
william
for
nine
years
that
we
have
gone
in
and
out
together
have
you
ever
known
me
tell
a
lie
but
god
will
clear
me
brother
said
william
how
do
i
know
what
you
may
have
done
in
the
secret
chambers
of
your
heart
to
give
satan
an
advantage
over
you
silas
was
still
looking
at
his
friend
suddenly
a
deep
flush
came
over
his
face
and
he
was
about
to
speak
impetuously
when
he
seemed
checked
again
by
some
inward
shock
that
sent
the
flush
back
and
made
him
tremble
but
at
last
he
spoke
feebly
looking
at
william
i
remember
now
the
knife
was
in
my
pocket
william
said
i
know
nothing
of
what
you
mean
the
other
persons
present
however
began
to
inquire
where
silas
meant
to
say
that
the
knife
was
but
he
would
give
no
further
explanation
he
only
said
i
am
sore
stricken
i
can
say
nothing
god
will
clear
me
on
their
return
to
the
vestry
there
was
further
deliberation
any
resort
to
legal
measures
for
ascertaining
the
culprit
was
contrary
to
the
principles
of
the
church
in
lantern
yard
according
to
which
prosecution
was
forbidden
to
christians
even
had
the
case
held
less
scandal
to
the
community
but
the
members
were
bound
to
take
other
measures
for
finding
out
the
truth
and
they
resolved
on
praying
and
drawing
lots
this
resolution
can
be
a
ground
of
surprise
only
to
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
that
obscure
religious
life
which
has
gone
on
in
the
alleys
of
our
towns
silas
knelt
with
his
brethren
relying
on
his
own
innocence
being
certified
by
immediate
divine
interference
but
feeling
that
there
was
sorrow
and
mourning
behind
for
him
even
then
that
his
trust
in
man
had
been
cruelly
bruised
lots
declared
that
silas
marner
was
he
was
solemnly
suspended
from
and
called
upon
to
render
up
the
stolen
money
only
on
confession
as
the
sign
of
repentance
could
he
be
received
once
more
within
the
folds
of
the
church
marner
listened
in
silence
at
last
when
everyone
rose
to
depart
he
went
towards
william
dane
and
said
in
a
voice
shaken
by
agitation
the
last
time
i
remember
using
my
knife
was
when
i
took
it
out
to
cut
a
strap
for
you
i
do
remember
putting
it
in
my
pocket
again
stole
the
money
and
you
have
woven
a
plot
to
lay
the
sin
at
my
door
but
you
may
prosper
for
all
that
there
is
no
just
god
that
governs
the
earth
righteously
but
a
god
of
lies
that
bears
witness
against
the
innocent
there
was
a
general
shudder
at
this
blasphemy
william
said
meekly
i
leave
our
brethren
to
judge
whether
this
is
the
voice
of
satan
or
not
i
can
do
nothing
but
pray
for
you
silas
poor
marner
went
out
with
that
despair
in
his
soul
that
shaken
trust
in
god
and
man
which
is
little
short
of
madness
to
a
loving
nature
in
the
bitterness
of
his
wounded
spirit
he
said
to
himself
will
cast
me
off
too
and
he
reflected
that
if
she
did
not
believe
the
testimony
against
him
her
whole
faith
must
be
upset
as
his
was
to
people
accustomed
to
reason
about
the
forms
in
which
their
religious
feeling
has
incorporated
itself
it
is
difficult
to
enter
into
that
simple
untaught
state
of
mind
in
which
the
form
and
the
feeling
have
never
been
severed
by
an
act
of
reflection
we
are
apt
to
think
it
inevitable
that
a
man
in
marner
position
should
have
begun
to
question
the
validity
of
an
appeal
to
the
divine
judgment
by
drawing
lots
but
to
him
this
would
have
been
an
effort
of
independent
thought
such
as
he
had
never
known
and
he
must
have
made
the
effort
at
a
moment
when
all
his
energies
were
turned
into
the
anguish
of
disappointed
faith
if
there
is
an
angel
who
records
the
sorrows
of
men
as
well
as
their
sins
he
knows
how
many
and
deep
are
the
sorrows
that
spring
from
false
ideas
for
which
no
man
is
culpable
marner
went
home
and
for
a
whole
day
sat
alone
stunned
by
despair
without
any
impulse
to
go
to
sarah
and
attempt
to
win
her
belief
in
his
innocence
the
second
day
he
took
refuge
from
benumbing
unbelief
by
getting
into
his
loom
and
working
away
as
usual
and
before
many
hours
were
past
the
minister
and
one
of
the
deacons
came
to
him
with
the
message
from
sarah
that
she
held
her
engagement
to
him
at
an
end
silas
received
the
message
mutely
and
then
turned
away
from
the
messengers
to
work
at
his
loom
again
in
little
more
than
a
month
from
that
time
sarah
was
married
to
william
dane
and
not
long
afterwards
it
was
known
to
the
brethren
in
lantern
yard
that
silas
marner
had
departed
from
the
town
chapter
ii
even
people
whose
lives
have
been
made
various
by
learning
sometimes
find
it
hard
to
keep
a
fast
hold
on
their
habitual
views
of
life
on
their
faith
in
the
invisible
nay
on
the
sense
that
their
past
joys
and
sorrows
are
a
real
experience
when
they
are
suddenly
transported
to
a
new
land
where
the
beings
around
them
know
nothing
of
their
history
and
share
none
of
their
ideas
where
their
mother
earth
shows
another
lap
and
human
life
has
other
forms
than
those
on
which
their
souls
have
been
nourished
minds
that
have
been
unhinged
from
their
old
faith
and
love
have
perhaps
sought
this
lethean
influence
of
exile
in
which
the
past
becomes
dreamy
because
its
symbols
have
all
vanished
and
the
present
too
is
dreamy
because
it
is
linked
with
no
memories
but
even
experience
may
hardly
enable
them
thoroughly
to
imagine
what
was
the
effect
on
a
simple
weaver
like
silas
marner
when
he
left
his
own
country
and
people
and
came
to
settle
in
raveloe
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
his
native
town
set
within
sight
of
the
widespread
hillsides
than
this
low
wooded
region
where
he
felt
hidden
even
from
the
heavens
by
the
screening
trees
and
hedgerows
there
was
nothing
here
when
he
rose
in
the
deep
morning
quiet
and
looked
out
on
the
dewy
brambles
and
rank
tufted
grass
that
seemed
to
have
any
relation
with
that
life
centring
in
lantern
yard
which
had
once
been
to
him
the
of
high
dispensations
the
whitewashed
walls
the
little
pews
where
figures
entered
with
a
subdued
rustling
and
where
first
one
voice
and
then
another
pitched
in
a
peculiar
key
of
petition
uttered
phrases
at
once
occult
and
familiar
like
the
amulet
worn
on
the
heart
the
pulpit
where
the
minister
delivered
unquestioned
doctrine
and
swayed
to
and
fro
and
handled
the
book
in
a
long
accustomed
manner
the
very
pauses
between
the
couplets
of
the
hymn
as
it
was
given
out
and
the
recurrent
swell
of
voices
in
song
these
things
had
been
the
channel
of
divine
influences
to
marner
they
were
the
fostering
home
of
his
religious
emotions
they
were
christianity
and
god
kingdom
upon
earth
a
weaver
who
finds
hard
words
in
his
knows
nothing
of
abstractions
as
the
little
child
knows
nothing
of
parental
love
but
only
knows
one
face
and
one
lap
towards
which
it
stretches
its
arms
for
refuge
and
nurture
and
what
could
be
more
unlike
that
lantern
yard
world
than
the
world
in
raveloe
orchards
looking
lazy
with
neglected
plenty
the
large
church
in
the
wide
churchyard
which
men
gazed
at
lounging
at
their
own
doors
in
the
farmers
jogging
along
the
lanes
or
turning
in
at
the
rainbow
homesteads
where
men
supped
heavily
and
slept
in
the
light
of
the
evening
hearth
and
where
women
seemed
to
be
laying
up
a
stock
of
linen
for
the
life
to
come
there
were
no
lips
in
raveloe
from
which
a
word
could
fall
that
would
stir
silas
benumbed
faith
to
a
sense
of
pain
in
the
early
ages
of
the
world
we
know
it
was
believed
that
each
territory
was
inhabited
and
ruled
by
its
own
divinities
so
that
a
man
could
cross
the
bordering
heights
and
be
out
of
the
reach
of
his
native
gods
whose
presence
was
confined
to
the
streams
and
the
groves
and
the
hills
among
which
he
had
lived
from
his
birth
and
poor
silas
was
vaguely
conscious
of
something
not
unlike
the
feeling
of
primitive
men
when
they
fled
thus
in
fear
or
in
sullenness
from
the
face
of
an
unpropitious
deity
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
power
he
had
vainly
trusted
in
among
the
streets
and
at
the
was
very
far
away
from
this
land
in
which
he
had
taken
refuge
where
men
lived
in
careless
abundance
knowing
and
needing
nothing
of
that
trust
which
for
him
had
been
turned
to
bitterness
the
little
light
he
possessed
spread
its
beams
so
narrowly
that
frustrated
belief
was
a
curtain
broad
enough
to
create
for
him
the
blackness
of
night
his
first
movement
after
the
shock
had
been
to
work
in
his
loom
and
he
went
on
with
this
unremittingly
never
asking
himself
why
now
he
was
come
to
raveloe
he
worked
far
on
into
the
night
to
finish
the
tale
of
osgood
sooner
than
she
expected
without
contemplating
beforehand
the
money
she
would
put
into
his
hand
for
the
work
he
seemed
to
weave
like
the
spider
from
pure
impulse
without
reflection
every
man
work
pursued
steadily
tends
in
this
way
to
become
an
end
in
itself
and
so
to
bridge
over
the
loveless
chasms
of
his
life
silas
hand
satisfied
itself
with
throwing
the
shuttle
and
his
eye
with
seeing
the
little
squares
in
the
cloth
complete
themselves
under
his
effort
then
there
were
the
calls
of
hunger
and
silas
in
his
solitude
had
to
provide
his
own
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
to
fetch
his
own
water
from
the
well
and
put
his
own
kettle
on
the
fire
and
all
these
immediate
promptings
helped
along
with
the
weaving
to
reduce
his
life
to
the
unquestioning
activity
of
a
spinning
insect
he
hated
the
thought
of
the
past
there
was
nothing
that
called
out
his
love
and
fellowship
toward
the
strangers
he
had
come
amongst
and
the
future
was
all
dark
for
there
was
no
unseen
love
that
cared
for
him
thought
was
arrested
by
utter
bewilderment
now
its
old
narrow
pathway
was
closed
and
affection
seemed
to
have
died
under
the
bruise
that
had
fallen
on
its
keenest
nerves
but
at
last
osgood
was
finished
and
silas
was
paid
in
gold
his
earnings
in
his
native
town
where
he
worked
for
a
wholesale
dealer
had
been
after
a
lower
rate
he
had
been
paid
weekly
and
of
his
weekly
earnings
a
large
proportion
had
gone
to
objects
of
piety
and
charity
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
five
bright
guineas
put
into
his
hand
no
man
expected
a
share
of
them
and
he
loved
no
man
that
he
should
offer
him
a
share
but
what
were
the
guineas
to
him
who
saw
no
vista
beyond
countless
days
of
weaving
it
was
needless
for
him
to
ask
that
for
it
was
pleasant
to
him
to
feel
them
in
his
palm
and
look
at
their
bright
faces
which
were
all
his
own
it
was
another
element
of
life
like
the
weaving
and
the
satisfaction
of
hunger
subsisting
quite
aloof
from
the
life
of
belief
and
love
from
which
he
had
been
cut
off
the
weaver
hand
had
known
the
touch
of
money
even
before
the
palm
had
grown
to
its
full
breadth
for
twenty
years
mysterious
money
had
stood
to
him
as
the
symbol
of
earthly
good
and
the
immediate
object
of
toil
he
had
seemed
to
love
it
little
in
the
years
when
every
penny
had
its
purpose
for
him
for
he
loved
the
then
but
now
when
all
purpose
was
gone
that
habit
of
looking
towards
the
money
and
grasping
it
with
a
sense
of
fulfilled
effort
made
a
loam
that
was
deep
enough
for
the
seeds
of
desire
and
as
silas
walked
homeward
across
the
fields
in
the
twilight
he
drew
out
the
money
and
thought
it
was
brighter
in
the
gathering
gloom
about
this
time
an
incident
happened
which
seemed
to
open
a
possibility
of
some
fellowship
with
his
neighbours
one
day
taking
a
pair
of
shoes
to
be
mended
he
saw
the
cobbler
wife
seated
by
the
fire
suffering
from
the
terrible
symptoms
of
and
dropsy
which
he
had
witnessed
as
the
precursors
of
his
mother
death
he
felt
a
rush
of
pity
at
the
mingled
sight
and
remembrance
and
recalling
the
relief
his
mother
had
found
from
a
simple
preparation
of
foxglove
he
promised
sally
oates
to
bring
her
something
that
would
ease
her
since
the
doctor
did
her
no
good
in
this
office
of
charity
silas
felt
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
raveloe
a
sense
of
unity
between
his
past
and
present
life
which
might
have
been
the
beginning
of
his
rescue
from
the
existence
into
which
his
nature
had
shrunk
but
sally
oates
disease
had
raised
her
into
a
personage
of
much
interest
and
importance
among
the
neighbours
and
the
fact
of
her
having
found
relief
from
drinking
silas
marner
stuff
became
a
matter
of
general
discourse
when
doctor
kimble
gave
physic
it
was
natural
that
it
should
have
an
effect
but
when
a
weaver
who
came
from
nobody
knew
where
worked
wonders
with
a
bottle
of
brown
waters
the
occult
character
of
the
process
was
evident
such
a
sort
of
thing
had
not
been
known
since
the
wise
woman
at
tarley
died
and
she
had
charms
as
well
as
stuff
everybody
went
to
her
when
their
children
had
fits
silas
marner
must
be
a
person
of
the
same
sort
for
how
did
he
know
what
would
bring
back
sally
oates
breath
if
he
did
know
a
fine
sight
more
than
that
the
wise
woman
had
words
that
she
muttered
to
herself
so
that
you
could
hear
what
they
were
and
if
she
tied
a
bit
of
red
thread
round
the
child
toe
the
while
it
would
keep
off
the
water
in
the
head
there
were
women
in
raveloe
at
that
present
time
who
had
worn
one
of
the
wise
woman
little
bags
round
their
necks
and
in
consequence
had
never
had
an
idiot
child
as
ann
coulter
had
silas
marner
could
very
likely
do
as
much
and
more
and
now
it
was
all
clear
how
he
should
have
come
from
unknown
parts
and
be
so
but
sally
oates
must
mind
and
not
tell
the
doctor
for
he
would
be
sure
to
set
his
face
against
marner
he
was
always
angry
about
the
wise
woman
and
used
to
threaten
those
who
went
to
her
that
they
should
have
none
of
his
help
any
more
silas
now
found
himself
and
his
cottage
suddenly
beset
by
mothers
who
wanted
him
to
charm
away
the
or
bring
back
the
milk
and
by
men
who
wanted
stuff
against
the
rheumatics
or
the
knots
in
the
hands
and
to
secure
themselves
against
a
refusal
the
applicants
brought
silver
in
their
palms
silas
might
have
driven
a
profitable
trade
in
charms
as
well
as
in
his
small
list
of
drugs
but
money
on
this
condition
was
no
temptation
to
him
he
had
never
known
an
impulse
towards
falsity
and
he
drove
one
after
another
away
with
growing
irritation
for
the
news
of
him
as
a
wise
man
had
spread
even
to
tarley
and
it
was
long
before
people
ceased
to
take
long
walks
for
the
sake
of
asking
his
aid
but
the
hope
in
his
wisdom
was
at
length
changed
into
dread
for
no
one
believed
him
when
he
said
he
knew
no
charms
and
could
work
no
cures
and
every
man
and
woman
who
had
an
accident
or
a
new
attack
after
applying
to
him
set
the
misfortune
down
to
master
marner
and
irritated
glances
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
his
movement
of
pity
towards
sally
oates
which
had
given
him
a
transient
sense
of
brotherhood
heightened
the
repulsion
between
him
and
his
neighbours
and
made
his
isolation
more
complete
gradually
the
guineas
the
crowns
and
the
grew
to
a
heap
and
marner
drew
less
and
less
for
his
own
wants
trying
to
solve
the
problem
of
keeping
himself
strong
enough
to
work
sixteen
hours
on
as
small
an
outlay
as
possible
have
not
men
shut
up
in
solitary
imprisonment
found
an
interest
in
marking
the
moments
by
straight
strokes
of
a
certain
length
on
the
wall
until
the
growth
of
the
sum
of
straight
strokes
arranged
in
triangles
has
become
a
mastering
purpose
do
we
not
wile
away
moments
of
inanity
or
fatigued
waiting
by
repeating
some
trivial
movement
or
sound
until
the
repetition
has
bred
a
want
which
is
incipient
habit
that
will
help
us
to
understand
how
the
love
of
accumulating
money
grows
an
absorbing
passion
in
men
whose
imaginations
even
in
the
very
beginning
of
their
hoard
showed
them
no
purpose
beyond
it
marner
wanted
the
heaps
of
ten
to
grow
into
a
square
and
then
into
a
larger
square
and
every
added
guinea
while
it
was
itself
a
satisfaction
bred
a
new
desire
in
this
strange
world
made
a
hopeless
riddle
to
him
he
might
if
he
had
had
a
less
intense
nature
have
sat
weaving
weaving
looking
towards
the
end
of
his
pattern
or
towards
the
end
of
his
web
till
he
forgot
the
riddle
and
everything
else
but
his
immediate
sensations
but
the
money
had
come
to
mark
off
his
weaving
into
periods
and
the
money
not
only
grew
but
it
remained
with
him
he
began
to
think
it
was
conscious
of
him
as
his
loom
was
and
he
would
on
no
account
have
exchanged
those
coins
which
had
become
his
familiars
for
other
coins
with
unknown
faces
he
handled
them
he
counted
them
till
their
form
and
colour
were
like
the
satisfaction
of
a
thirst
to
him
but
it
was
only
in
the
night
when
his
work
was
done
that
he
drew
them
out
to
enjoy
their
companionship
he
had
taken
up
some
bricks
in
his
floor
underneath
his
loom
and
here
he
had
made
a
hole
in
which
he
set
the
iron
pot
that
contained
his
guineas
and
silver
coins
covering
the
bricks
with
sand
whenever
he
replaced
them
not
that
the
idea
of
being
robbed
presented
itself
often
or
strongly
to
his
mind
hoarding
was
common
in
country
districts
in
those
days
there
were
old
labourers
in
the
parish
of
raveloe
who
were
known
to
have
their
savings
by
them
probably
inside
their
but
their
rustic
neighbours
though
not
all
of
them
as
honest
as
their
ancestors
in
the
days
of
king
alfred
had
not
imaginations
bold
enough
to
lay
a
plan
of
burglary
how
could
they
have
spent
the
money
in
their
own
village
without
betraying
themselves
they
would
be
obliged
to
run
away
a
course
as
dark
and
dubious
as
a
balloon
journey
so
year
after
year
silas
marner
had
lived
in
this
solitude
his
guineas
rising
in
the
iron
pot
and
his
life
narrowing
and
hardening
itself
more
and
more
into
a
mere
pulsation
of
desire
and
satisfaction
that
had
no
relation
to
any
other
being
his
life
had
reduced
itself
to
the
functions
of
weaving
and
hoarding
without
any
contemplation
of
an
end
towards
which
the
functions
tended
the
same
sort
of
process
has
perhaps
been
undergone
by
wiser
men
when
they
have
been
cut
off
from
faith
and
love
only
instead
of
a
loom
and
a
heap
of
guineas
they
have
had
some
erudite
research
some
ingenious
project
or
some
theory
strangely
marner
face
and
figure
shrank
and
bent
themselves
into
a
constant
mechanical
relation
to
the
objects
of
his
life
so
that
he
produced
the
same
sort
of
impression
as
a
handle
or
a
crooked
tube
which
has
no
meaning
standing
apart
the
prominent
eyes
that
used
to
look
trusting
and
dreamy
now
looked
as
if
they
had
been
made
to
see
only
one
kind
of
thing
that
was
very
small
like
tiny
grain
for
which
they
hunted
everywhere
and
he
was
so
withered
and
yellow
that
though
he
was
not
yet
forty
the
children
always
called
him
old
master
marner
yet
even
in
this
stage
of
withering
a
little
incident
happened
which
showed
that
the
sap
of
affection
was
not
all
gone
it
was
one
of
his
daily
tasks
to
fetch
his
water
from
a
well
a
couple
of
fields
off
and
for
this
purpose
ever
since
he
came
to
raveloe
he
had
had
a
brown
earthenware
pot
which
he
held
as
his
most
precious
utensil
among
the
very
few
conveniences
he
had
granted
himself
it
had
been
his
companion
for
twelve
years
always
standing
on
the
same
spot
always
lending
its
handle
to
him
in
the
early
morning
so
that
its
form
had
an
expression
for
him
of
willing
helpfulness
and
the
impress
of
its
handle
on
his
palm
gave
a
satisfaction
mingled
with
that
of
having
the
fresh
clear
water
one
day
as
he
was
returning
from
the
well
he
stumbled
against
the
step
of
the
stile
and
his
brown
pot
falling
with
force
against
the
stones
that
overarched
the
ditch
below
him
was
broken
in
three
pieces
silas
picked
up
the
pieces
and
carried
them
home
with
grief
in
his
heart
the
brown
pot
could
never
be
of
use
to
him
any
more
but
he
stuck
the
bits
together
and
propped
the
ruin
in
its
old
place
for
a
memorial
this
is
the
history
of
silas
marner
until
the
fifteenth
year
after
he
came
to
raveloe
the
livelong
day
he
sat
in
his
loom
his
ear
filled
with
its
monotony
his
eyes
bent
close
down
on
the
slow
growth
of
sameness
in
the
brownish
web
his
muscles
moving
with
such
even
repetition
that
their
pause
seemed
almost
as
much
a
constraint
as
the
holding
of
his
breath
but
at
night
came
his
revelry
at
night
he
closed
his
shutters
and
made
fast
his
doors
and
drew
forth
his
gold
long
ago
the
heap
of
coins
had
become
too
large
for
the
iron
pot
to
hold
them
and
he
had
made
for
them
two
thick
leather
bags
which
wasted
no
room
in
their
but
lent
themselves
flexibly
to
every
corner
how
the
guineas
shone
as
they
came
pouring
out
of
the
dark
leather
mouths
the
silver
bore
no
large
proportion
in
amount
to
the
gold
because
the
long
pieces
of
linen
which
formed
his
chief
work
were
always
partly
paid
for
in
gold
and
out
of
the
silver
he
supplied
his
own
bodily
wants
choosing
always
the
shillings
and
sixpences
to
spend
in
this
way
he
loved
the
guineas
best
but
he
would
not
change
the
silver
the
crowns
and
that
were
his
own
earnings
begotten
by
his
labour
he
loved
them
all
he
spread
them
out
in
heaps
and
bathed
his
hands
in
them
then
he
counted
them
and
set
them
up
in
regular
piles
and
felt
their
rounded
outline
between
his
thumb
and
fingers
and
thought
fondly
of
the
guineas
that
were
only
by
the
work
in
his
loom
as
if
they
had
been
unborn
children
thought
of
the
guineas
that
were
coming
slowly
through
the
coming
years
through
all
his
life
which
spread
far
away
before
him
the
end
quite
hidden
by
countless
days
of
weaving
no
wonder
his
thoughts
were
still
with
his
loom
and
his
money
when
he
made
his
journeys
through
the
fields
and
the
lanes
to
fetch
and
carry
home
his
work
so
that
his
steps
never
wandered
to
the
and
the
in
search
of
the
once
familiar
herbs
these
too
belonged
to
the
past
from
which
his
life
had
shrunk
away
like
a
rivulet
that
has
sunk
far
down
from
the
grassy
fringe
of
its
old
breadth
into
a
little
shivering
thread
that
cuts
a
groove
for
itself
in
the
barren
sand
but
about
the
christmas
of
that
fifteenth
year
a
second
great
change
came
over
marner
life
and
his
history
became
blent
in
a
singular
manner
with
the
life
of
his
neighbours
chapter
iii
the
greatest
man
in
raveloe
was
squire
cass
who
lived
in
the
large
red
house
with
the
handsome
flight
of
stone
steps
in
front
and
the
high
stables
behind
it
nearly
opposite
the
church
he
was
only
one
among
several
landed
parishioners
but
he
alone
was
honoured
with
the
title
of
squire
for
though
osgood
family
was
also
understood
to
be
of
timeless
origin
the
raveloe
imagination
having
never
ventured
back
to
that
fearful
blank
when
there
were
no
osgoods
still
he
merely
owned
the
farm
he
occupied
whereas
squire
cass
had
a
tenant
or
two
who
complained
of
the
game
to
him
quite
as
if
he
had
been
a
lord
it
was
still
that
glorious
which
was
felt
to
be
a
peculiar
favour
of
providence
towards
the
landed
interest
and
the
fall
of
prices
had
not
yet
come
to
carry
the
race
of
small
squires
and
yeomen
down
that
road
to
ruin
for
which
extravagant
habits
and
bad
husbandry
were
plentifully
anointing
their
wheels
i
am
speaking
now
in
relation
to
raveloe
and
the
parishes
that
resembled
it
for
our
country
life
had
many
different
aspects
as
all
life
must
have
when
it
is
spread
over
a
various
surface
and
breathed
on
variously
by
multitudinous
currents
from
the
winds
of
heaven
to
the
thoughts
of
men
which
are
for
ever
moving
and
crossing
each
other
with
incalculable
results
raveloe
lay
low
among
the
bushy
trees
and
the
rutted
lanes
aloof
from
the
currents
of
industrial
energy
and
puritan
earnestness
the
rich
ate
and
drank
freely
accepting
gout
and
apoplexy
as
things
that
ran
mysteriously
in
respectable
families
and
the
poor
thought
that
the
rich
were
entirely
in
the
right
of
it
to
lead
a
jolly
life
besides
their
feasting
caused
a
multiplication
of
orts
which
were
the
heirlooms
of
the
poor
betty
jay
scented
the
boiling
of
squire
cass
hams
but
her
longing
was
arrested
by
the
unctuous
liquor
in
which
they
were
boiled
and
when
the
seasons
brought
round
the
great
they
were
regarded
on
all
hands
as
a
fine
thing
for
the
poor
for
the
raveloe
feasts
were
like
the
rounds
of
beef
and
the
barrels
of
ale
they
were
on
a
large
scale
and
lasted
a
good
while
especially
in
the
after
ladies
had
packed
up
their
best
gowns
and
in
bandboxes
and
had
incurred
the
risk
of
fording
streams
on
pillions
with
the
precious
burden
in
rainy
or
snowy
weather
when
there
was
no
knowing
how
high
the
water
would
rise
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
they
looked
forward
to
a
brief
pleasure
on
this
ground
it
was
always
contrived
in
the
dark
seasons
when
there
was
little
work
to
be
done
and
the
hours
were
long
that
several
neighbours
should
keep
open
house
in
succession
so
soon
as
squire
cass
standing
dishes
diminished
in
plenty
and
freshness
his
guests
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
a
little
higher
up
the
village
to
osgood
at
the
orchards
and
they
found
hams
and
chines
uncut
with
the
scent
of
the
fire
in
them
spun
butter
in
all
its
freshness
everything
in
fact
that
appetites
at
leisure
could
desire
in
perhaps
greater
perfection
though
not
in
greater
abundance
than
at
squire
cass
for
the
squire
wife
had
died
long
ago
and
the
red
house
was
without
that
presence
of
the
wife
and
mother
which
is
the
fountain
of
wholesome
love
and
fear
in
parlour
and
kitchen
and
this
helped
to
account
not
only
for
there
being
more
profusion
than
finished
excellence
in
the
holiday
provisions
but
also
for
the
frequency
with
which
the
proud
squire
condescended
to
preside
in
the
parlour
of
the
rainbow
rather
than
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
dark
wainscot
perhaps
also
for
the
fact
that
his
sons
had
turned
out
rather
raveloe
was
not
a
place
where
moral
censure
was
severe
but
it
was
thought
a
weakness
in
the
squire
that
he
had
kept
all
his
sons
at
home
in
idleness
and
though
some
licence
was
to
be
allowed
to
young
men
whose
fathers
could
afford
it
people
shook
their
heads
at
the
courses
of
the
second
son
dunstan
commonly
called
dunsey
cass
whose
taste
for
swopping
and
betting
might
turn
out
to
be
a
sowing
of
something
worse
than
wild
oats
to
be
sure
the
neighbours
said
it
was
no
matter
what
became
of
dunsey
a
spiteful
jeering
fellow
who
seemed
to
enjoy
his
drink
the
more
when
other
people
went
dry
always
provided
that
his
doings
did
not
bring
trouble
on
a
family
like
squire
cass
with
a
monument
in
the
church
and
tankards
older
than
king
george
but
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
godfrey
the
eldest
a
fine
young
man
who
was
to
come
into
the
land
some
day
should
take
to
going
along
the
same
road
with
his
brother
as
he
had
seemed
to
do
of
late
if
he
went
on
in
that
way
he
would
lose
miss
nancy
lammeter
for
it
was
well
known
that
she
had
looked
very
shyly
on
him
ever
since
last
whitsuntide
twelvemonth
when
there
was
so
much
talk
about
his
being
away
from
home
days
and
days
together
there
was
something
wrong
more
than
common
that
was
quite
clear
for
godfrey
did
look
half
so
and
open
as
he
used
to
do
at
one
time
everybody
was
saying
what
a
handsome
couple
he
and
miss
nancy
lammeter
would
make
and
if
she
could
come
to
be
mistress
at
the
red
house
there
would
be
a
fine
change
for
the
lammeters
had
been
brought
up
in
that
way
that
they
never
suffered
a
pinch
of
salt
to
be
wasted
and
yet
everybody
in
their
household
had
of
the
best
according
to
his
place
such
a
would
be
a
saving
to
the
old
squire
if
she
never
brought
a
penny
to
her
fortune
for
it
was
to
be
feared
that
notwithstanding
his
incomings
there
were
more
holes
in
his
pocket
than
the
one
where
he
put
his
own
hand
in
but
if
godfrey
did
turn
over
a
new
leaf
he
might
say
to
miss
nancy
lammeter
it
was
the
once
hopeful
godfrey
who
was
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
and
his
back
to
the
fire
in
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
one
late
november
afternoon
in
that
fifteenth
year
of
silas
life
at
raveloe
the
fading
grey
light
fell
dimly
on
the
walls
decorated
with
guns
whips
and
foxes
brushes
on
coats
and
hats
flung
on
the
chairs
on
tankards
sending
forth
a
scent
of
flat
ale
and
on
a
fire
with
pipes
propped
up
in
the
signs
of
a
domestic
life
destitute
of
any
hallowing
charm
with
which
the
look
of
gloomy
vexation
on
godfrey
blond
face
was
in
sad
accordance
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
and
listening
for
some
one
approach
and
presently
the
sound
of
a
heavy
step
with
an
accompanying
whistle
was
heard
across
the
large
empty
the
door
opened
and
a
young
man
entered
with
the
flushed
face
and
the
gratuitously
elated
bearing
which
mark
the
first
stage
of
intoxication
it
was
dunsey
and
at
the
sight
of
him
godfrey
face
parted
with
some
of
its
gloom
to
take
on
the
more
active
expression
of
hatred
the
handsome
brown
spaniel
that
lay
on
the
hearth
retreated
under
the
chair
in
the
well
master
godfrey
what
do
you
want
with
me
said
dunsey
in
a
mocking
tone
you
my
elders
and
betters
you
know
i
was
obliged
to
come
when
you
sent
for
me
why
this
is
what
i
want
and
just
shake
yourself
sober
and
listen
will
you
said
godfrey
savagely
he
had
himself
been
drinking
more
than
was
good
for
him
trying
to
turn
his
gloom
into
uncalculating
anger
i
want
to
tell
you
i
must
hand
over
that
rent
of
fowler
to
the
squire
or
else
tell
him
i
gave
it
you
for
he
threatening
to
distrain
for
it
and
it
all
be
out
soon
whether
i
tell
him
or
not
he
said
just
now
before
he
went
out
he
should
send
word
to
cox
to
distrain
if
fowler
did
come
and
pay
up
his
arrears
this
week
the
squire
short
o
cash
and
in
no
humour
to
stand
any
nonsense
and
you
know
what
he
threatened
if
ever
he
found
you
making
away
with
his
money
again
so
see
and
get
the
money
and
pretty
quickly
will
you
oh
said
dunsey
sneeringly
coming
nearer
to
his
brother
and
looking
in
his
face
suppose
now
you
get
the
money
yourself
and
save
me
the
trouble
eh
since
you
was
so
kind
as
to
hand
it
over
to
me
you
not
refuse
me
the
kindness
to
pay
it
back
for
me
it
was
your
brotherly
love
made
you
do
it
you
know
godfrey
bit
his
lips
and
clenched
his
fist
do
come
near
me
with
that
look
else
i
knock
you
down
oh
no
you
wo
said
dunsey
turning
away
on
his
heel
however
because
i
such
a
brother
you
know
i
might
get
you
turned
out
of
house
and
home
and
cut
off
with
a
shilling
any
day
i
might
tell
the
squire
how
his
handsome
son
was
married
to
that
nice
young
woman
molly
farren
and
was
very
unhappy
because
he
live
with
his
drunken
wife
and
i
should
slip
into
your
place
as
comfortable
as
could
be
but
you
see
i
do
do
it
i
so
easy
and
you
take
any
trouble
for
me
you
get
the
hundred
pounds
for
me
i
know
you
will
how
can
i
get
the
money
said
godfrey
quivering
i
have
a
shilling
to
bless
myself
with
and
it
a
lie
that
you
slip
into
my
place
you
get
yourself
turned
out
too
that
all
for
if
you
begin
telling
tales
i
follow
bob
my
father
favourite
you
know
that
very
well
he
only
think
himself
well
rid
of
you
never
mind
said
dunsey
nodding
his
head
sideways
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
it
be
very
pleasant
to
me
to
go
in
your
company
you
such
a
handsome
brother
and
we
always
been
so
fond
of
quarrelling
with
one
another
i
should
know
what
to
do
without
you
but
you
like
better
for
us
both
to
stay
at
home
together
i
know
you
would
so
you
manage
to
get
that
little
sum
o
money
and
i
bid
you
though
i
sorry
to
part
dunstan
was
moving
off
but
godfrey
rushed
after
him
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
saying
with
an
oath
i
tell
you
i
have
no
money
i
can
get
no
money
borrow
of
old
kimble
i
tell
you
he
wo
lend
me
any
more
and
i
sha
ask
him
well
then
sell
wildfire
yes
that
easy
talking
i
must
have
the
money
directly
well
you
only
got
to
ride
him
to
the
hunt
there
be
bryce
and
keating
there
for
sure
you
get
more
bids
than
one
i
daresay
and
get
back
home
at
eight
splashed
up
to
the
chin
i
going
to
osgood
birthday
dance
oho
said
dunsey
turning
his
head
on
one
side
and
trying
to
speak
in
a
small
mincing
treble
and
there
sweet
miss
nancy
coming
and
we
shall
dance
with
her
and
promise
never
to
be
naughty
again
and
be
taken
into
favour
and
hold
your
tongue
about
miss
nancy
you
fool
said
godfrey
turning
red
else
i
throttle
you
what
for
said
dunsey
still
in
an
artificial
tone
but
taking
a
whip
from
the
table
and
beating
the
of
it
on
his
palm
a
very
good
chance
i
advise
you
to
creep
up
her
sleeve
again
it
be
saving
time
if
molly
should
happen
to
take
a
drop
too
much
laudanum
some
day
and
make
a
widower
of
you
miss
nancy
would
mind
being
a
second
if
she
did
know
it
and
you
got
a
brother
who
keep
your
secret
well
because
you
be
so
very
obliging
to
him
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
godfrey
quivering
and
pale
again
my
patience
is
pretty
near
at
an
end
if
you
a
little
more
sharpness
in
you
you
might
know
that
you
may
urge
a
man
a
bit
too
far
and
make
one
leap
as
easy
as
another
i
do
know
but
what
it
is
so
now
i
may
as
well
tell
the
squire
everything
myself
i
should
get
you
off
my
back
if
i
got
nothing
else
and
after
all
he
know
some
time
she
been
threatening
to
come
herself
and
tell
him
so
flatter
yourself
that
your
secrecy
worth
any
price
you
choose
to
ask
you
drain
me
of
money
till
i
have
got
nothing
to
pacify
with
and
she
do
as
she
threatens
some
day
it
all
one
i
tell
my
father
everything
myself
and
you
may
go
to
the
devil
dunsey
perceived
that
he
had
overshot
his
mark
and
that
there
was
a
point
at
which
even
the
hesitating
godfrey
might
be
driven
into
decision
but
he
said
with
an
air
of
unconcern
as
you
please
but
i
have
a
draught
of
ale
first
and
ringing
the
bell
he
threw
himself
across
two
chairs
and
began
to
rap
the
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
godfrey
stood
still
with
his
back
to
the
fire
uneasily
moving
his
fingers
among
the
contents
of
his
and
looking
at
the
floor
that
big
muscular
frame
of
his
held
plenty
of
animal
courage
but
helped
him
to
no
decision
when
the
dangers
to
be
braved
were
such
as
could
neither
be
knocked
down
nor
throttled
his
natural
irresolution
and
moral
cowardice
were
exaggerated
by
a
position
in
which
dreaded
consequences
seemed
to
press
equally
on
all
sides
and
his
irritation
had
no
sooner
provoked
him
to
defy
dunstan
and
anticipate
all
possible
betrayals
than
the
miseries
he
must
bring
on
himself
by
such
a
step
seemed
more
unendurable
to
him
than
the
present
evil
the
results
of
confession
were
not
contingent
they
were
certain
whereas
betrayal
was
not
certain
from
the
near
vision
of
that
certainty
he
fell
back
on
suspense
and
vacillation
with
a
sense
of
repose
the
disinherited
son
of
a
small
squire
equally
disinclined
to
dig
and
to
beg
was
almost
as
helpless
as
an
uprooted
tree
which
by
the
favour
of
earth
and
sky
has
grown
to
a
handsome
bulk
on
the
spot
where
it
first
shot
upward
perhaps
it
would
have
been
possible
to
think
of
digging
with
some
cheerfulness
if
nancy
lammeter
were
to
be
won
on
those
terms
but
since
he
must
irrevocably
lose
as
well
as
the
inheritance
and
must
break
every
tie
but
the
one
that
degraded
him
and
left
him
without
motive
for
trying
to
recover
his
better
self
he
could
imagine
no
future
for
himself
on
the
other
side
of
confession
but
that
of
for
a
soldier
the
most
desperate
step
short
of
suicide
in
the
eyes
of
respectable
families
no
he
would
rather
trust
to
casualties
than
to
his
own
resolve
rather
go
on
sitting
at
the
feast
and
sipping
the
wine
he
loved
though
with
the
sword
hanging
over
him
and
terror
in
his
heart
than
rush
away
into
the
cold
darkness
where
there
was
no
pleasure
left
the
utmost
concession
to
dunstan
about
the
horse
began
to
seem
easy
compared
with
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
threat
but
his
pride
would
not
let
him
recommence
the
conversation
otherwise
than
by
continuing
the
quarrel
dunstan
was
waiting
for
this
and
took
his
ale
in
shorter
draughts
than
usual
it
just
like
you
godfrey
burst
out
in
a
bitter
tone
to
talk
about
my
selling
wildfire
in
that
cool
way
the
last
thing
i
got
to
call
my
own
and
the
best
bit
of
i
ever
had
in
my
life
and
if
you
got
a
spark
of
pride
in
you
you
be
ashamed
to
see
the
stables
emptied
and
everybody
sneering
about
it
but
it
my
belief
you
sell
yourself
if
it
was
only
for
the
pleasure
of
making
somebody
feel
he
got
a
bad
bargain
aye
aye
said
dunstan
very
placably
you
do
me
justice
i
see
you
know
i
a
jewel
for
people
into
bargains
for
which
reason
i
advise
you
to
let
sell
wildfire
i
ride
him
to
the
hunt
for
you
with
pleasure
i
should
look
so
handsome
as
you
in
the
saddle
but
it
the
horse
they
bid
for
and
not
the
rider
yes
i
daresay
trust
my
horse
to
you
as
you
please
said
dunstan
rapping
the
again
with
an
air
of
great
unconcern
it
have
got
to
pay
fowler
money
it
none
of
my
business
you
received
the
money
from
him
when
you
went
to
bramcote
and
told
the
squire
it
was
paid
i
nothing
to
do
with
that
you
chose
to
be
so
obliging
as
to
give
it
me
that
was
all
if
you
do
want
to
pay
the
money
let
it
alone
it
all
one
to
me
but
i
was
willing
to
accommodate
you
by
undertaking
to
sell
the
horse
seeing
it
not
convenient
to
you
to
go
so
far
godfrey
was
silent
for
some
moments
he
would
have
liked
to
spring
on
dunstan
wrench
the
whip
from
his
hand
and
flog
him
to
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
no
bodily
fear
could
have
deterred
him
but
he
was
mastered
by
another
sort
of
fear
which
was
fed
by
feelings
stronger
even
than
his
resentment
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
tone
well
you
mean
no
nonsense
about
the
horse
eh
you
sell
him
all
fair
and
hand
over
the
money
if
you
do
you
know
everything
go
to
smash
for
i
got
nothing
else
to
trust
to
and
you
have
less
pleasure
in
pulling
the
house
over
my
head
when
your
own
to
be
broken
too
aye
aye
said
dunstan
rising
all
right
i
thought
you
come
round
i
the
fellow
to
bring
old
bryce
up
to
the
scratch
i
get
you
a
hundred
and
twenty
for
him
if
i
get
you
a
penny
but
it
perhaps
rain
cats
and
dogs
as
it
did
yesterday
and
then
you
ca
go
said
godfrey
hardly
knowing
whether
he
wished
for
that
obstacle
or
not
not
said
dunstan
i
always
lucky
in
my
weather
it
might
rain
if
you
wanted
to
go
yourself
you
never
hold
trumps
you
know
i
always
do
you
got
the
beauty
you
see
and
i
got
the
luck
so
you
must
keep
me
by
you
for
your
crooked
sixpence
you
get
along
without
me
confound
you
hold
your
tongue
said
godfrey
impetuously
and
take
care
to
keep
sober
else
you
get
pitched
on
your
head
coming
home
and
wildfire
might
be
the
worse
for
it
make
your
tender
heart
easy
said
dunstan
opening
the
door
you
never
knew
me
see
double
when
i
got
a
bargain
to
make
it
spoil
the
fun
besides
whenever
i
fall
i
warranted
to
fall
on
my
legs
with
that
dunstan
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
left
godfrey
to
that
bitter
rumination
on
his
personal
circumstances
which
was
now
unbroken
from
day
to
day
save
by
the
excitement
of
sporting
drinking
or
the
rarer
and
less
oblivious
pleasure
of
seeing
miss
nancy
lammeter
the
subtle
and
varied
pains
springing
from
the
higher
sensibility
that
accompanies
higher
culture
are
perhaps
less
pitiable
than
that
dreary
absence
of
impersonal
enjoyment
and
consolation
which
leaves
ruder
minds
to
the
perpetual
urgent
companionship
of
their
own
griefs
and
discontents
the
lives
of
those
rural
forefathers
whom
we
are
apt
to
think
very
prosaic
figures
men
whose
only
work
was
to
ride
round
their
land
getting
heavier
and
heavier
in
their
saddles
and
who
passed
the
rest
of
their
days
in
the
gratification
of
senses
dulled
by
monotony
had
a
certain
pathos
in
them
nevertheless
calamities
came
to
too
and
their
early
errors
carried
hard
consequences
perhaps
the
love
of
some
sweet
maiden
the
image
of
purity
order
and
calm
had
opened
their
eyes
to
the
vision
of
a
life
in
which
the
days
would
not
seem
too
long
even
without
rioting
but
the
maiden
was
lost
and
the
vision
passed
away
and
then
what
was
left
to
them
especially
when
they
had
become
too
heavy
for
the
hunt
or
for
carrying
a
gun
over
the
furrows
but
to
drink
and
get
merry
or
to
drink
and
get
angry
so
that
they
might
be
independent
of
variety
and
say
over
again
with
eager
emphasis
the
things
they
had
said
already
any
time
that
twelvemonth
assuredly
among
these
flushed
and
men
there
were
some
whom
thanks
to
their
native
even
riot
could
never
drive
into
brutality
men
who
when
their
cheeks
were
fresh
had
felt
the
keen
point
of
sorrow
or
remorse
had
been
pierced
by
the
reeds
they
leaned
on
or
had
lightly
put
their
limbs
in
fetters
from
which
no
struggle
could
loose
them
and
under
these
sad
circumstances
common
to
us
all
their
thoughts
could
find
no
outside
the
round
of
their
own
petty
history
that
at
least
was
the
condition
of
godfrey
cass
in
this
year
of
his
life
a
movement
of
compunction
helped
by
those
small
indefinable
influences
which
every
personal
relation
exerts
on
a
pliant
nature
had
urged
him
into
a
secret
marriage
which
was
a
blight
on
his
life
it
was
an
ugly
story
of
low
passion
delusion
and
waking
from
delusion
which
needs
not
to
be
dragged
from
the
privacy
of
godfrey
bitter
memory
he
had
long
known
that
the
delusion
was
partly
due
to
a
trap
laid
for
him
by
dunstan
who
saw
in
his
brother
degrading
marriage
the
means
of
gratifying
at
once
his
jealous
hate
and
his
cupidity
and
if
godfrey
could
have
felt
himself
simply
a
victim
the
iron
bit
that
destiny
had
put
into
his
mouth
would
have
chafed
him
less
intolerably
if
the
curses
he
muttered
half
aloud
when
he
was
alone
had
had
no
other
object
than
dunstan
diabolical
cunning
he
might
have
shrunk
less
from
the
consequences
of
avowal
but
he
had
something
else
to
curse
his
own
vicious
folly
which
now
seemed
as
mad
and
unaccountable
to
him
as
almost
all
our
follies
and
vices
do
when
their
promptings
have
long
passed
away
for
four
years
he
had
thought
of
nancy
lammeter
and
wooed
her
with
tacit
patient
worship
as
the
woman
who
made
him
think
of
the
future
with
joy
she
would
be
his
wife
and
would
make
home
lovely
to
him
as
his
home
had
never
been
and
it
would
be
easy
when
she
was
always
near
to
shake
off
those
foolish
habits
that
were
no
pleasures
but
only
a
feverish
way
of
annulling
vacancy
godfrey
was
an
essentially
domestic
nature
bred
up
in
a
home
where
the
hearth
had
no
smiles
and
where
the
daily
habits
were
not
chastised
by
the
presence
of
household
order
his
easy
disposition
made
him
fall
in
unresistingly
with
the
family
courses
but
the
need
of
some
tender
permanent
affection
the
longing
for
some
influence
that
would
make
the
good
he
preferred
easy
to
pursue
caused
the
neatness
purity
and
liberal
orderliness
of
the
lammeter
household
sunned
by
the
smile
of
nancy
to
seem
like
those
fresh
bright
hours
of
the
morning
when
temptations
go
to
sleep
and
leave
the
ear
open
to
the
voice
of
the
good
angel
inviting
to
industry
sobriety
and
peace
and
yet
the
hope
of
this
paradise
had
not
been
enough
to
save
him
from
a
course
which
shut
him
out
of
it
for
ever
instead
of
keeping
fast
hold
of
the
strong
silken
rope
by
which
nancy
would
have
drawn
him
safe
to
the
green
banks
where
it
was
easy
to
step
firmly
he
had
let
himself
be
dragged
back
into
mud
and
slime
in
which
it
was
useless
to
struggle
he
had
made
ties
for
himself
which
robbed
him
of
all
wholesome
motive
and
were
a
constant
exasperation
still
there
was
one
position
worse
than
the
present
it
was
the
position
he
would
be
in
when
the
ugly
secret
was
disclosed
and
the
desire
that
continually
triumphed
over
every
other
was
that
of
warding
off
the
evil
day
when
he
would
have
to
bear
the
consequences
of
his
father
violent
resentment
for
the
wound
inflicted
on
his
family
pride
would
have
perhaps
to
turn
his
back
on
that
hereditary
ease
and
dignity
which
after
all
was
a
sort
of
reason
for
living
and
would
carry
with
him
the
certainty
that
he
was
banished
for
ever
from
the
sight
and
esteem
of
nancy
lammeter
the
longer
the
interval
the
more
chance
there
was
of
deliverance
from
some
at
least
of
the
hateful
consequences
to
which
he
had
sold
himself
the
more
opportunities
remained
for
him
to
snatch
the
strange
gratification
of
seeing
nancy
and
gathering
some
faint
indications
of
her
lingering
regard
towards
this
gratification
he
was
impelled
fitfully
every
now
and
then
after
having
passed
weeks
in
which
he
had
avoided
her
as
the
prize
that
only
made
him
spring
forward
and
find
his
chain
all
the
more
galling
one
of
those
fits
of
yearning
was
on
him
now
and
it
would
have
been
strong
enough
to
have
persuaded
him
to
trust
wildfire
to
dunstan
rather
than
disappoint
the
yearning
even
if
he
had
not
had
another
reason
for
his
disinclination
towards
the
morrow
hunt
that
other
reason
was
the
fact
that
the
morning
meet
was
near
batherley
the
where
the
unhappy
woman
lived
whose
image
became
more
odious
to
him
every
day
and
to
his
thought
the
whole
vicinage
was
haunted
by
her
the
yoke
a
man
creates
for
himself
by
will
breed
hate
in
the
kindliest
nature
and
the
godfrey
cass
was
fast
becoming
a
bitter
man
visited
by
cruel
wishes
that
seemed
to
enter
and
depart
and
enter
again
like
demons
who
had
found
in
him
a
home
what
was
he
to
do
this
evening
to
pass
the
time
he
might
as
well
go
to
the
rainbow
and
hear
the
talk
about
the
everybody
was
there
and
what
else
was
there
to
be
done
though
for
his
own
part
he
did
not
care
a
button
for
snuff
the
brown
spaniel
who
had
placed
herself
in
front
of
him
and
had
been
watching
him
for
some
time
now
jumped
up
in
impatience
for
the
expected
caress
but
godfrey
thrust
her
away
without
looking
at
her
and
left
the
room
followed
humbly
by
the
unresenting
snuff
perhaps
because
she
saw
no
other
career
open
to
her
chapter
iv
dunstan
cass
setting
off
in
the
raw
morning
at
the
judiciously
quiet
pace
of
a
man
who
is
obliged
to
ride
to
cover
on
his
hunter
had
to
take
his
way
along
the
lane
which
at
its
farther
extremity
passed
by
the
piece
of
unenclosed
ground
called
the
where
stood
the
cottage
once
a
shed
now
for
fifteen
years
inhabited
by
silas
marner
the
spot
looked
very
dreary
at
this
season
with
the
moist
trodden
clay
about
it
and
the
red
muddy
water
high
up
in
the
deserted
quarry
that
was
dunstan
first
thought
as
he
approached
it
the
second
was
that
the
old
fool
of
a
weaver
whose
loom
he
heard
rattling
already
had
a
great
deal
of
money
hidden
somewhere
how
was
it
that
he
dunstan
cass
who
had
often
heard
talk
of
miserliness
had
never
thought
of
suggesting
to
godfrey
that
he
should
frighten
or
persuade
the
old
fellow
into
lending
the
money
on
the
excellent
security
of
the
young
squire
prospects
the
resource
occurred
to
him
now
as
so
easy
and
agreeable
especially
as
hoard
was
likely
to
be
large
enough
to
leave
godfrey
a
handsome
surplus
beyond
his
immediate
needs
and
enable
him
to
accommodate
his
faithful
brother
that
he
had
almost
turned
the
horse
head
towards
home
again
godfrey
would
be
ready
enough
to
accept
the
suggestion
he
would
snatch
eagerly
at
a
plan
that
might
save
him
from
parting
with
wildfire
but
when
dunstan
meditation
reached
this
point
the
inclination
to
go
on
grew
strong
and
prevailed
he
did
want
to
give
godfrey
that
pleasure
he
preferred
that
master
godfrey
should
be
vexed
moreover
dunstan
enjoyed
the
consciousness
of
having
a
horse
to
sell
and
the
opportunity
of
driving
a
bargain
swaggering
and
possibly
taking
somebody
in
he
might
have
all
the
satisfaction
attendant
on
selling
his
brother
horse
and
not
the
less
have
the
further
satisfaction
of
setting
godfrey
to
borrow
marner
money
so
he
rode
on
to
cover
bryce
and
keating
were
there
as
dunstan
was
quite
sure
they
would
be
he
was
such
a
lucky
fellow
heyday
said
bryce
who
had
long
had
his
eye
on
wildfire
you
on
your
brother
horse
how
that
oh
i
swopped
with
him
said
dunstan
whose
delight
in
lying
grandly
independent
of
utility
was
not
to
be
diminished
by
the
likelihood
that
his
hearer
would
not
believe
him
wildfire
mine
now
what
has
he
swopped
with
you
for
that
hack
of
yours
said
bryce
quite
aware
that
he
should
get
another
lie
in
answer
oh
there
was
a
little
account
between
us
said
dunsey
carelessly
and
wildfire
made
it
even
i
accommodated
him
by
taking
the
horse
though
it
was
against
my
will
for
i
got
an
itch
for
a
mare
jortin
as
rare
a
bit
o
blood
as
ever
you
threw
your
leg
across
but
i
shall
keep
wildfire
now
i
got
him
though
i
a
bid
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
him
the
other
day
from
a
man
over
at
flitton
he
buying
for
lord
cromleck
a
fellow
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
and
a
green
waistcoat
but
i
mean
to
stick
to
wildfire
i
get
a
better
at
a
fence
in
a
hurry
the
mare
got
more
blood
but
she
a
bit
too
weak
in
the
bryce
of
course
divined
that
dunstan
wanted
to
sell
the
horse
and
dunstan
knew
that
he
divined
it
is
only
one
of
many
human
transactions
carried
on
in
this
ingenious
manner
and
they
both
considered
that
the
bargain
was
in
its
first
stage
when
bryce
replied
ironically
i
wonder
at
that
now
i
wonder
you
mean
to
keep
him
for
i
never
heard
of
a
man
who
did
want
to
sell
his
horse
getting
a
bid
of
half
as
much
again
as
the
horse
was
worth
you
be
lucky
if
you
get
a
hundred
keating
rode
up
now
and
the
transaction
became
more
complicated
it
ended
in
the
purchase
of
the
horse
by
bryce
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
to
be
paid
on
the
delivery
of
wildfire
safe
and
sound
at
the
batherley
stables
it
did
occur
to
dunsey
that
it
might
be
wise
for
him
to
give
up
the
day
hunting
proceed
at
once
to
batherley
and
having
waited
for
bryce
return
hire
a
horse
to
carry
him
home
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
but
the
inclination
for
a
run
encouraged
by
confidence
in
his
luck
and
by
a
draught
of
brandy
from
his
at
the
conclusion
of
the
bargain
was
not
easy
to
overcome
especially
with
a
horse
under
him
that
would
take
the
fences
to
the
admiration
of
the
field
dunstan
however
took
one
fence
too
many
and
got
his
horse
pierced
with
a
his
own
person
which
was
quite
unmarketable
escaped
without
injury
but
poor
wildfire
unconscious
of
his
price
turned
on
his
flank
and
painfully
panted
his
last
it
happened
that
dunstan
a
short
time
before
having
had
to
get
down
to
arrange
his
stirrup
had
muttered
a
good
many
curses
at
this
interruption
which
had
thrown
him
in
the
rear
of
the
hunt
near
the
moment
of
glory
and
under
this
exasperation
had
taken
the
fences
more
blindly
he
would
soon
have
been
up
with
the
hounds
again
when
the
fatal
accident
happened
and
hence
he
was
between
eager
riders
in
advance
not
troubling
themselves
about
what
happened
behind
them
and
stragglers
who
were
as
likely
as
not
to
pass
quite
aloof
from
the
line
of
road
in
which
wildfire
had
fallen
dunstan
whose
nature
it
was
to
care
more
for
immediate
annoyances
than
for
remote
consequences
no
sooner
recovered
his
legs
and
saw
that
it
was
all
over
with
wildfire
than
he
felt
a
satisfaction
at
the
absence
of
witnesses
to
a
position
which
no
swaggering
could
make
enviable
reinforcing
himself
after
his
shake
with
a
little
brandy
and
much
swearing
he
walked
as
fast
as
he
could
to
a
coppice
on
his
right
hand
through
which
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
make
his
way
to
batherley
without
danger
of
encountering
any
member
of
the
hunt
his
first
intention
was
to
hire
a
horse
there
and
ride
home
forthwith
for
to
walk
many
miles
without
a
gun
in
his
hand
and
along
an
ordinary
road
was
as
much
out
of
the
question
to
him
as
to
other
spirited
young
men
of
his
kind
he
did
not
much
mind
about
taking
the
bad
news
to
godfrey
for
he
had
to
offer
him
at
the
same
time
the
resource
of
marner
money
and
if
godfrey
kicked
as
he
always
did
at
the
notion
of
making
a
fresh
debt
from
which
he
himself
got
the
smallest
share
of
advantage
why
he
would
kick
long
dunstan
felt
sure
he
could
worry
godfrey
into
anything
the
idea
of
marner
money
kept
growing
in
vividness
now
the
want
of
it
had
become
immediate
the
prospect
of
having
to
make
his
appearance
with
the
muddy
boots
of
a
pedestrian
at
batherley
and
to
encounter
the
grinning
queries
of
stablemen
stood
unpleasantly
in
the
way
of
his
impatience
to
be
back
at
raveloe
and
carry
out
his
felicitous
plan
and
a
casual
visitation
of
his
as
he
was
ruminating
awakened
his
memory
to
the
fact
that
the
two
or
three
small
coins
his
forefinger
encountered
there
were
of
too
pale
a
colour
to
cover
that
small
debt
without
payment
of
which
the
had
declared
he
would
never
do
any
more
business
with
dunsey
cass
after
all
according
to
the
direction
in
which
the
run
had
brought
him
he
was
not
so
very
much
farther
from
home
than
he
was
from
batherley
but
dunsey
not
being
remarkable
for
clearness
of
head
was
only
led
to
this
conclusion
by
the
gradual
perception
that
there
were
other
reasons
for
choosing
the
unprecedented
course
of
walking
home
it
was
now
nearly
four
and
a
mist
was
gathering
the
sooner
he
got
into
the
road
the
better
he
remembered
having
crossed
the
road
and
seen
the
only
a
little
while
before
wildfire
broke
down
so
buttoning
his
coat
twisting
the
lash
of
his
compactly
round
the
handle
and
rapping
the
tops
of
his
boots
with
a
air
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
at
all
taken
by
surprise
he
set
off
with
the
sense
that
he
was
undertaking
a
remarkable
feat
of
bodily
exertion
which
somehow
and
at
some
time
he
should
be
able
to
dress
up
and
magnify
to
the
admiration
of
a
select
circle
at
the
rainbow
when
a
young
gentleman
like
dunsey
is
reduced
to
so
exceptional
a
mode
of
locomotion
as
walking
a
whip
in
his
hand
is
a
desirable
corrective
to
a
too
bewildering
dreamy
sense
of
unwontedness
in
his
position
and
dunstan
as
he
went
along
through
the
gathering
mist
was
always
rapping
his
whip
somewhere
it
was
godfrey
whip
which
he
had
chosen
to
take
without
leave
because
it
had
a
gold
handle
of
course
no
one
could
see
when
dunstan
held
it
that
the
name
was
cut
in
deep
letters
on
that
gold
handle
they
could
only
see
that
it
was
a
very
handsome
whip
dunsey
was
not
without
fear
that
he
might
meet
some
acquaintance
in
whose
eyes
he
would
cut
a
pitiable
figure
for
mist
is
no
screen
when
people
get
close
to
each
other
but
when
he
at
last
found
himself
in
the
raveloe
lanes
without
having
met
a
soul
he
silently
remarked
that
that
was
part
of
his
usual
good
luck
but
now
the
mist
helped
by
the
evening
darkness
was
more
of
a
screen
than
he
desired
for
it
hid
the
ruts
into
which
his
feet
were
liable
to
slip
hid
everything
so
that
he
had
to
guide
his
steps
by
dragging
his
whip
along
the
low
bushes
in
advance
of
the
hedgerow
he
must
soon
he
thought
be
getting
near
the
opening
at
the
he
should
find
it
out
by
the
break
in
the
hedgerow
he
found
it
out
however
by
another
circumstance
which
he
had
not
expected
namely
by
certain
gleams
of
light
which
he
presently
guessed
to
proceed
from
silas
marner
cottage
that
cottage
and
the
money
hidden
within
it
had
been
in
his
mind
continually
during
his
walk
and
he
had
been
imagining
ways
of
cajoling
and
tempting
the
weaver
to
part
with
the
immediate
possession
of
his
money
for
the
sake
of
receiving
interest
dunstan
felt
as
if
there
must
be
a
little
frightening
added
to
the
cajolery
for
his
own
arithmetical
convictions
were
not
clear
enough
to
afford
him
any
forcible
demonstration
as
to
the
advantages
of
interest
and
as
for
security
he
regarded
it
vaguely
as
a
means
of
cheating
a
man
by
making
him
believe
that
he
would
be
paid
altogether
the
operation
on
the
miser
mind
was
a
task
that
godfrey
would
be
sure
to
hand
over
to
his
more
daring
and
cunning
brother
dunstan
had
made
up
his
mind
to
that
and
by
the
time
he
saw
the
light
gleaming
through
the
chinks
of
marner
shutters
the
idea
of
a
dialogue
with
the
weaver
had
become
so
familiar
to
him
that
it
occurred
to
him
as
quite
a
natural
thing
to
make
the
acquaintance
forthwith
there
might
be
several
conveniences
attending
this
course
the
weaver
had
possibly
got
a
lantern
and
dunstan
was
tired
of
feeling
his
way
he
was
still
nearly
of
a
mile
from
home
and
the
lane
was
becoming
unpleasantly
slippery
for
the
mist
was
passing
into
rain
he
turned
up
the
bank
not
without
some
fear
lest
he
might
miss
the
right
way
since
he
was
not
certain
whether
the
light
were
in
front
or
on
the
side
of
the
cottage
but
he
felt
the
ground
before
him
cautiously
with
his
and
at
last
arrived
safely
at
the
door
he
knocked
loudly
rather
enjoying
the
idea
that
the
old
fellow
would
be
frightened
at
the
sudden
noise
he
heard
no
movement
in
reply
all
was
silence
in
the
cottage
was
the
weaver
gone
to
bed
then
if
so
why
had
he
left
a
light
that
was
a
strange
forgetfulness
in
a
miser
dunstan
knocked
still
more
loudly
and
without
pausing
for
a
reply
pushed
his
fingers
through
the
intending
to
shake
the
door
and
pull
the
up
and
down
not
doubting
that
the
door
was
fastened
but
to
his
surprise
at
this
double
motion
the
door
opened
and
he
found
himself
in
front
of
a
bright
fire
which
lit
up
every
corner
of
the
cottage
the
bed
the
loom
the
three
chairs
and
the
table
and
showed
him
that
marner
was
not
there
nothing
at
that
moment
could
be
much
more
inviting
to
dunsey
than
the
bright
fire
on
the
brick
hearth
he
walked
in
and
seated
himself
by
it
at
once
there
was
something
in
front
of
the
fire
too
that
would
have
been
inviting
to
a
hungry
man
if
it
had
been
in
a
different
stage
of
cooking
it
was
a
small
bit
of
pork
suspended
from
the
by
a
string
passed
through
a
large
in
a
way
known
to
primitive
housekeepers
unpossessed
of
jacks
but
the
pork
had
been
hung
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
hanger
apparently
to
prevent
the
roasting
from
proceeding
too
rapidly
during
the
absence
the
old
staring
simpleton
had
hot
meat
for
his
supper
then
thought
dunstan
people
had
always
said
he
lived
on
mouldy
bread
on
purpose
to
check
his
appetite
but
where
could
he
be
at
this
time
and
on
such
an
evening
leaving
his
supper
in
this
stage
of
preparation
and
his
door
unfastened
dunstan
own
recent
difficulty
in
making
his
way
suggested
to
him
that
the
weaver
had
perhaps
gone
outside
his
cottage
to
fetch
in
fuel
or
for
some
such
brief
purpose
and
had
slipped
into
the
that
was
an
interesting
idea
to
dunstan
carrying
consequences
of
entire
novelty
if
the
weaver
was
dead
who
had
a
right
to
his
money
who
would
know
where
his
money
was
hidden
would
know
that
anybody
had
come
to
take
it
away
he
went
no
farther
into
the
subtleties
of
evidence
the
pressing
question
where
the
money
now
took
such
entire
possession
of
him
as
to
make
him
quite
forget
that
the
weaver
death
was
not
a
certainty
a
dull
mind
once
arriving
at
an
inference
that
flatters
a
desire
is
rarely
able
to
retain
the
impression
that
the
notion
from
which
the
inference
started
was
purely
problematic
and
dunstan
mind
was
as
dull
as
the
mind
of
a
possible
felon
usually
is
there
were
only
three
where
he
had
ever
heard
of
cottagers
hoards
being
found
the
thatch
the
bed
and
a
hole
in
the
floor
marner
cottage
had
no
thatch
and
dunstan
first
act
after
a
train
of
thought
made
rapid
by
the
stimulus
of
cupidity
was
to
go
up
to
the
bed
but
while
he
did
so
his
eyes
travelled
eagerly
over
the
floor
where
the
bricks
distinct
in
the
were
discernible
under
the
sprinkling
of
sand
but
not
everywhere
for
there
was
one
spot
and
one
only
which
was
quite
covered
with
sand
and
sand
showing
the
marks
of
fingers
which
had
apparently
been
careful
to
spread
it
over
a
given
space
it
was
near
the
treddles
of
the
loom
in
an
instant
dunstan
darted
to
that
spot
swept
away
the
sand
with
his
whip
and
inserting
the
thin
end
of
the
hook
between
the
bricks
found
that
they
were
loose
in
haste
he
lifted
up
two
bricks
and
saw
what
he
had
no
doubt
was
the
object
of
his
search
for
what
could
there
be
but
money
in
those
two
leathern
bags
and
from
their
weight
they
must
be
filled
with
guineas
dunstan
felt
round
the
hole
to
be
certain
that
it
held
no
more
then
hastily
replaced
the
bricks
and
spread
the
sand
over
them
hardly
more
than
five
minutes
had
passed
since
he
entered
the
cottage
but
it
seemed
to
dunstan
like
a
long
while
and
though
he
was
without
any
distinct
recognition
of
the
possibility
that
marner
might
be
alive
and
might
the
cottage
at
any
moment
he
felt
an
undefinable
dread
laying
hold
on
him
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
bags
in
his
hand
he
would
hasten
out
into
the
darkness
and
then
consider
what
he
should
do
with
the
bags
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
immediately
that
he
might
shut
in
the
stream
of
light
a
few
steps
would
be
enough
to
carry
him
beyond
betrayal
by
the
gleams
from
the
and
the
the
rain
and
darkness
had
got
thicker
and
he
was
glad
of
it
though
it
was
awkward
walking
with
both
hands
filled
so
that
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
grasp
his
whip
along
with
one
of
the
bags
but
when
he
had
gone
a
yard
or
two
he
might
take
his
time
so
he
stepped
forward
into
the
darkness
chapter
v
when
dunstan
cass
turned
his
back
on
the
cottage
silas
marner
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
from
it
plodding
along
from
the
village
with
a
sack
thrown
round
his
shoulders
as
an
overcoat
and
with
a
horn
lantern
in
his
hand
his
legs
were
weary
but
his
mind
was
at
ease
free
from
the
presentiment
of
change
the
sense
of
security
more
frequently
springs
from
habit
than
from
conviction
and
for
this
reason
it
often
subsists
after
such
a
change
in
the
conditions
as
might
have
been
expected
to
suggest
alarm
the
lapse
of
time
during
which
a
given
event
has
not
happened
is
in
this
logic
of
habit
constantly
alleged
as
a
reason
why
the
event
should
never
happen
even
when
the
lapse
of
time
is
precisely
the
added
condition
which
makes
the
event
imminent
a
man
will
tell
you
that
he
has
worked
in
a
mine
for
forty
years
unhurt
by
an
accident
as
a
reason
why
he
should
apprehend
no
danger
though
the
roof
is
beginning
to
sink
and
it
is
often
observable
that
the
older
a
man
gets
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
him
to
retain
a
believing
conception
of
his
own
death
this
influence
of
habit
was
necessarily
strong
in
a
man
whose
life
was
so
monotonous
as
marner
who
saw
no
new
people
and
heard
of
no
new
events
to
keep
alive
in
him
the
idea
of
the
unexpected
and
the
changeful
and
it
explains
simply
enough
why
his
mind
could
be
at
ease
though
he
had
left
his
house
and
his
treasure
more
defenceless
than
usual
silas
was
thinking
with
double
complacency
of
his
supper
first
because
it
would
be
hot
and
savoury
and
secondly
because
it
would
cost
him
nothing
for
the
little
bit
of
pork
was
a
present
from
that
excellent
housewife
miss
priscilla
lammeter
to
whom
he
had
this
day
carried
home
a
handsome
piece
of
linen
and
it
was
only
on
occasion
of
a
present
like
this
that
silas
indulged
himself
with
supper
was
his
favourite
meal
because
it
came
at
his
time
of
revelry
when
his
heart
warmed
over
his
gold
whenever
he
had
he
always
chose
to
have
it
for
supper
but
this
evening
he
had
no
sooner
ingeniously
knotted
his
string
fast
round
his
bit
of
pork
twisted
the
string
according
to
rule
over
his
passed
it
through
the
handle
and
made
it
fast
on
the
hanger
than
he
remembered
that
a
piece
of
very
fine
twine
was
indispensable
to
his
setting
up
a
new
piece
of
work
in
his
loom
early
in
the
morning
it
had
slipped
his
memory
because
in
coming
from
lammeter
he
had
not
had
to
pass
through
the
village
but
to
lose
time
by
going
on
errands
in
the
morning
was
out
of
the
question
it
was
a
nasty
fog
to
turn
out
into
but
there
were
things
silas
loved
better
than
his
own
comfort
so
drawing
his
pork
to
the
extremity
of
the
hanger
and
arming
himself
with
his
lantern
and
his
old
sack
he
set
out
on
what
in
ordinary
weather
would
have
been
a
twenty
errand
he
could
not
have
locked
his
door
without
undoing
his
string
and
retarding
his
supper
it
was
not
worth
his
while
to
make
that
sacrifice
what
thief
would
find
his
way
to
the
on
such
a
night
as
this
and
why
should
he
come
on
this
particular
night
when
he
had
never
come
through
all
the
fifteen
years
before
these
questions
were
not
distinctly
present
in
silas
mind
they
merely
serve
to
represent
the
foundation
of
his
freedom
from
anxiety
he
reached
his
door
in
much
satisfaction
that
his
errand
was
done
he
opened
it
and
to
his
eyes
everything
remained
as
he
had
left
it
except
that
the
fire
sent
out
a
welcome
increase
of
heat
he
trod
about
the
floor
while
putting
by
his
lantern
and
throwing
aside
his
hat
and
sack
so
as
to
merge
the
marks
of
dunstan
feet
on
the
sand
in
the
marks
of
his
own
nailed
boots
then
he
moved
his
pork
nearer
to
the
fire
and
sat
down
to
the
agreeable
business
of
tending
the
meat
and
warming
himself
at
the
same
time
any
one
who
had
looked
at
him
as
the
red
light
shone
upon
his
pale
face
strange
straining
eyes
and
meagre
form
would
perhaps
have
understood
the
mixture
of
contemptuous
pity
dread
and
suspicion
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
his
neighbours
in
raveloe
yet
few
men
could
be
more
harmless
than
poor
marner
in
his
truthful
simple
soul
not
even
the
growing
greed
and
worship
of
gold
could
beget
any
vice
directly
injurious
to
others
the
light
of
his
faith
quite
put
out
and
his
affections
made
desolate
he
had
clung
with
all
the
force
of
his
nature
to
his
work
and
his
money
and
like
all
objects
to
which
a
man
devotes
himself
they
had
fashioned
him
into
correspondence
with
themselves
his
loom
as
he
wrought
in
it
without
ceasing
had
in
its
turn
wrought
on
him
and
confirmed
more
and
more
the
monotonous
craving
for
its
monotonous
response
his
gold
as
he
hung
over
it
and
saw
it
grow
gathered
his
power
of
loving
together
into
a
hard
isolation
like
its
own
as
soon
as
he
was
warm
he
began
to
think
it
would
be
a
long
while
to
wait
till
after
supper
before
he
drew
out
his
guineas
and
it
would
be
pleasant
to
see
them
on
the
table
before
him
as
he
ate
his
unwonted
feast
for
joy
is
the
best
of
wine
and
silas
guineas
were
a
golden
wine
of
that
sort
he
rose
and
placed
his
candle
unsuspectingly
on
the
floor
near
his
loom
swept
away
the
sand
without
noticing
any
change
and
removed
the
bricks
the
sight
of
the
empty
hole
made
his
heart
leap
violently
but
the
belief
that
his
gold
was
gone
could
not
come
at
once
only
terror
and
the
eager
effort
to
put
an
end
to
the
terror
he
passed
his
trembling
hand
all
about
the
hole
trying
to
think
it
possible
that
his
eyes
had
deceived
him
then
he
held
the
candle
in
the
hole
and
examined
it
curiously
trembling
more
and
more
at
last
he
shook
so
violently
that
he
let
fall
the
candle
and
lifted
his
hands
to
his
head
trying
to
steady
himself
that
he
might
think
had
he
put
his
gold
somewhere
else
by
a
sudden
resolution
last
night
and
then
forgotten
it
a
man
falling
into
dark
waters
seeks
a
momentary
footing
even
on
sliding
stones
and
silas
by
acting
as
if
he
believed
in
false
hopes
warded
off
the
moment
of
despair
he
searched
in
every
corner
he
turned
his
bed
over
and
shook
it
and
kneaded
it
he
looked
in
his
brick
oven
where
he
laid
his
sticks
when
there
was
no
other
place
to
be
searched
he
kneeled
down
again
and
felt
once
more
all
round
the
hole
there
was
no
untried
refuge
left
for
a
moment
shelter
from
the
terrible
truth
yes
there
was
a
sort
of
refuge
which
always
comes
with
the
prostration
of
thought
under
an
overpowering
passion
it
was
that
expectation
of
impossibilities
that
belief
in
contradictory
images
which
is
still
distinct
from
madness
because
it
is
capable
of
being
dissipated
by
the
external
fact
silas
got
up
from
his
knees
trembling
and
looked
round
at
the
table
did
the
gold
lie
there
after
all
the
table
was
bare
then
he
turned
and
looked
behind
him
looked
all
round
his
dwelling
seeming
to
strain
his
brown
eyes
after
some
possible
appearance
of
the
bags
where
he
had
already
sought
them
in
vain
he
could
see
every
object
in
his
cottage
and
his
gold
was
not
there
again
he
put
his
trembling
hands
to
his
head
and
gave
a
wild
ringing
scream
the
cry
of
desolation
for
a
few
moments
after
he
stood
motionless
but
the
cry
had
relieved
him
from
the
first
maddening
pressure
of
the
truth
he
turned
and
tottered
towards
his
loom
and
got
into
the
seat
where
he
worked
instinctively
seeking
this
as
the
strongest
assurance
of
reality
and
now
that
all
the
false
hopes
had
vanished
and
the
first
shock
of
certainty
was
past
the
idea
of
a
thief
began
to
present
itself
and
he
entertained
it
eagerly
because
a
thief
might
be
caught
and
made
to
restore
the
gold
the
thought
brought
some
new
strength
with
it
and
he
started
from
his
loom
to
the
door
as
he
opened
it
the
rain
beat
in
upon
him
for
it
was
falling
more
and
more
heavily
there
were
no
footsteps
to
be
tracked
on
such
a
night
footsteps
when
had
the
thief
come
during
silas
absence
in
the
daytime
the
door
had
been
locked
and
there
had
been
no
marks
of
any
inroad
on
his
return
by
daylight
and
in
the
evening
too
he
said
to
himself
everything
was
the
same
as
when
he
had
left
it
the
sand
and
bricks
looked
as
if
they
had
not
been
moved
it
a
thief
who
had
taken
the
bags
or
was
it
a
cruel
power
that
no
hands
could
reach
which
had
delighted
in
making
him
a
second
time
desolate
he
shrank
from
this
vaguer
dread
and
fixed
his
mind
with
struggling
effort
on
the
robber
with
hands
who
could
be
reached
by
hands
his
thoughts
glanced
at
all
the
neighbours
who
had
made
any
remarks
or
asked
any
questions
which
he
might
now
regard
as
a
ground
of
suspicion
there
was
jem
rodney
a
known
poacher
and
otherwise
disreputable
he
had
often
met
marner
in
his
journeys
across
the
fields
and
had
said
something
jestingly
about
the
weaver
money
nay
he
had
once
irritated
marner
by
lingering
at
the
fire
when
he
called
to
light
his
pipe
instead
of
going
about
his
business
jem
rodney
was
the
man
there
was
ease
in
the
thought
jem
could
be
found
and
made
to
restore
the
money
marner
did
not
want
to
punish
him
but
only
to
get
back
his
gold
which
had
gone
from
him
and
left
his
soul
like
a
forlorn
traveller
on
an
unknown
desert
the
robber
must
be
laid
hold
of
marner
ideas
of
legal
authority
were
confused
but
he
felt
that
he
must
go
and
proclaim
his
loss
and
the
great
people
in
the
village
the
clergyman
the
constable
and
squire
cass
would
make
jem
rodney
or
somebody
else
deliver
up
the
stolen
money
he
rushed
out
in
the
rain
under
the
stimulus
of
this
hope
forgetting
to
cover
his
head
not
caring
to
fasten
his
door
for
he
felt
as
if
he
had
nothing
left
to
lose
he
ran
swiftly
till
want
of
breath
compelled
him
to
slacken
his
pace
as
he
was
entering
the
village
at
the
turning
close
to
the
rainbow
the
rainbow
in
marner
view
was
a
place
of
luxurious
resort
for
rich
and
stout
husbands
whose
wives
had
superfluous
stores
of
linen
it
was
the
place
where
he
was
likely
to
find
the
powers
and
dignities
of
raveloe
and
where
he
could
most
speedily
make
his
loss
public
he
lifted
the
latch
and
turned
into
the
bright
bar
or
kitchen
on
the
right
hand
where
the
less
lofty
customers
of
the
house
were
in
the
habit
of
assembling
the
parlour
on
the
left
being
reserved
for
the
more
select
society
in
which
squire
cass
frequently
enjoyed
the
double
pleasure
of
conviviality
and
condescension
but
the
parlour
was
dark
the
chief
personages
who
ornamented
its
circle
being
all
at
osgood
birthday
dance
as
godfrey
cass
was
and
in
consequence
of
this
the
party
on
the
seats
in
the
kitchen
was
more
numerous
than
usual
several
personages
who
would
otherwise
have
been
admitted
into
the
parlour
and
enlarged
the
opportunity
of
hectoring
and
condescension
for
their
betters
being
content
this
evening
to
vary
their
enjoyment
by
taking
their
where
they
could
themselves
hector
and
condescend
in
company
that
called
for
beer
chapter
vi
the
conversation
which
was
at
a
high
pitch
of
animation
when
silas
approached
the
door
of
the
rainbow
had
as
usual
been
slow
and
intermittent
when
the
company
first
assembled
the
pipes
began
to
be
puffed
in
a
silence
which
had
an
air
of
severity
the
more
important
customers
who
drank
spirits
and
sat
nearest
the
fire
staring
at
each
other
as
if
a
bet
were
depending
on
the
first
man
who
winked
while
the
chiefly
men
in
fustian
jackets
and
kept
their
eyelids
down
and
rubbed
their
hands
across
their
mouths
as
if
their
draughts
of
beer
were
a
funereal
duty
attended
with
embarrassing
sadness
at
last
snell
the
landlord
a
man
of
a
neutral
disposition
accustomed
to
stand
aloof
from
human
differences
as
those
of
beings
who
were
all
alike
in
need
of
liquor
broke
silence
by
saying
in
a
doubtful
tone
to
his
cousin
the
butcher
some
folks
say
that
was
a
fine
beast
you
druv
in
yesterday
bob
the
butcher
a
jolly
smiling
man
was
not
disposed
to
answer
rashly
he
gave
a
few
puffs
before
he
spat
and
replied
and
they
would
be
fur
wrong
john
after
this
feeble
delusive
thaw
the
silence
set
in
as
severely
as
before
was
it
a
red
durham
said
the
farrier
taking
up
the
thread
of
discourse
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
the
farrier
looked
at
the
landlord
and
the
landlord
looked
at
the
butcher
as
the
person
who
must
take
the
responsibility
of
answering
red
it
was
said
the
butcher
in
his
husky
treble
and
a
durham
it
was
then
you
need
tell
who
you
bought
it
of
said
the
farrier
looking
round
with
some
triumph
i
know
who
it
is
has
got
the
red
durhams
o
this
and
she
a
white
star
on
her
brow
bet
a
penny
the
farrier
leaned
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
as
he
put
this
question
and
his
eyes
twinkled
knowingly
well
yes
she
might
said
the
butcher
slowly
considering
that
he
was
giving
a
decided
affirmative
i
do
say
contrairy
i
knew
that
very
well
said
the
farrier
throwing
himself
backward
again
and
speaking
defiantly
if
do
know
lammeter
cows
i
should
like
to
know
who
does
that
all
and
as
for
the
cow
bought
bargain
or
no
bargain
i
been
at
the
drenching
of
her
contradick
me
who
will
the
farrier
looked
fierce
and
the
mild
butcher
conversational
spirit
was
roused
a
little
i
not
for
contradicking
no
man
he
said
i
for
peace
and
quietness
some
are
for
cutting
long
ribs
i
for
cutting
short
myself
but
do
quarrel
with
all
i
say
is
it
a
lovely
carkiss
and
anybody
as
was
reasonable
it
bring
tears
into
their
eyes
to
look
at
it
well
it
the
cow
as
i
drenched
whatever
it
is
pursued
the
farrier
angrily
and
it
was
lammeter
cow
else
you
told
a
lie
when
you
said
it
was
a
red
durham
i
tell
no
lies
said
the
butcher
with
the
same
mild
huskiness
as
before
and
i
contradick
none
not
if
a
man
was
to
swear
himself
black
he
no
meat
o
mine
nor
none
o
my
bargains
all
i
say
is
it
a
lovely
carkiss
and
what
i
say
i
stick
to
but
i
quarrel
wi
no
man
no
said
the
farrier
with
bitter
sarcasm
looking
at
the
company
generally
and
you
are
and
you
say
the
cow
was
a
red
durham
and
you
did
say
she
got
a
star
on
her
brow
stick
to
that
now
you
at
it
come
come
said
the
landlord
let
the
cow
alone
the
truth
lies
atween
you
you
both
right
and
both
wrong
as
i
allays
say
and
as
for
the
cow
being
lammeter
i
say
nothing
to
that
but
this
i
say
as
the
rainbow
the
rainbow
and
for
the
matter
o
that
if
the
talk
is
to
be
o
the
lammeters
know
the
most
upo
that
head
eh
macey
you
remember
when
first
lammeter
father
come
into
these
parts
and
took
the
warrens
macey
tailor
and
the
latter
of
which
functions
rheumatism
had
of
late
obliged
him
to
share
with
a
young
man
who
sat
opposite
him
held
his
white
head
on
one
side
and
twirled
his
thumbs
with
an
air
of
complacency
slightly
seasoned
with
criticism
he
smiled
pityingly
in
answer
to
the
landlord
appeal
and
said
aye
aye
i
know
i
know
but
i
let
other
folks
talk
i
laid
by
now
and
gev
up
to
the
young
uns
ask
them
as
have
been
to
school
at
tarley
they
learnt
pernouncing
that
come
up
since
my
day
if
you
pointing
at
me
macey
said
the
deputy
clerk
with
an
air
of
anxious
propriety
i
nowise
a
man
to
speak
out
of
my
place
as
the
psalm
says
i
know
what
right
nor
only
so
but
also
practise
what
i
know
well
then
i
wish
you
keep
hold
o
the
tune
when
it
set
for
you
if
you
for
i
wish
you
that
said
a
large
man
an
excellent
wheelwright
in
his
capacity
but
on
sundays
leader
of
the
choir
he
winked
as
he
spoke
at
two
of
the
company
who
were
known
officially
as
the
bassoon
and
the
in
the
confidence
that
he
was
expressing
the
sense
of
the
musical
profession
in
raveloe
tookey
the
who
shared
the
unpopularity
common
to
deputies
turned
very
red
but
replied
with
careful
moderation
winthrop
if
you
bring
me
any
proof
as
i
in
the
wrong
i
not
the
man
to
say
i
wo
alter
but
there
people
set
up
their
own
ears
for
a
standard
and
expect
the
whole
choir
to
follow
there
may
be
two
opinions
i
hope
aye
aye
said
macey
who
felt
very
well
satisfied
with
this
attack
on
youthful
presumption
you
right
there
tookey
allays
two
there
the
a
man
has
of
himsen
and
there
the
other
folks
have
on
him
there
be
two
about
a
cracked
bell
if
the
bell
could
hear
itself
well
macey
said
poor
tookey
serious
amidst
the
general
laughter
i
undertook
to
partially
fill
up
the
office
of
by
crackenthorp
desire
whenever
your
infirmities
should
make
you
unfitting
and
it
one
of
the
rights
thereof
to
sing
in
the
choir
else
why
have
you
done
the
same
yourself
ah
but
the
old
gentleman
and
you
are
two
folks
said
ben
winthrop
the
old
gentleman
got
a
gift
why
the
squire
used
to
invite
him
to
take
a
glass
only
to
hear
him
sing
the
red
rovier
did
he
macey
it
a
gift
there
my
little
lad
aaron
he
got
a
gift
he
can
sing
a
tune
off
straight
like
a
throstle
but
as
for
you
master
tookey
you
better
stick
to
your
amens
your
voice
is
well
enough
when
you
keep
it
up
in
your
nose
it
your
inside
as
is
right
made
for
music
it
no
better
nor
a
hollow
stalk
this
kind
of
unflinching
frankness
was
the
most
piquant
form
of
joke
to
the
company
at
the
rainbow
and
ben
winthrop
insult
was
felt
by
everybody
to
have
capped
macey
epigram
i
see
what
it
is
plain
enough
said
tookey
unable
to
keep
cool
any
longer
there
a
consperacy
to
turn
me
out
o
the
choir
as
i
should
share
the
christmas
money
that
where
it
is
but
i
shall
speak
to
crackenthorp
i
not
be
put
upon
by
no
man
nay
nay
tookey
said
ben
winthrop
we
pay
you
your
share
to
keep
out
of
it
that
what
we
do
there
things
folks
pay
to
be
rid
on
besides
varmin
come
come
said
the
landlord
who
felt
that
paying
people
for
their
absence
was
a
principle
dangerous
to
society
a
joke
a
joke
all
good
friends
here
i
hope
we
must
give
and
take
you
both
right
and
you
both
wrong
as
i
say
i
agree
wi
macey
here
as
there
two
opinions
and
if
mine
was
asked
i
should
say
they
both
right
tookey
right
and
winthrop
right
and
they
only
got
to
split
the
difference
and
make
themselves
even
the
farrier
was
puffing
his
pipe
rather
fiercely
in
some
contempt
at
this
trivial
discussion
he
had
no
ear
for
music
himself
and
never
went
to
church
as
being
of
the
medical
profession
and
likely
to
be
in
requisition
for
delicate
cows
but
the
butcher
having
music
in
his
soul
had
listened
with
a
divided
desire
for
tookey
defeat
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
peace
to
be
sure
he
said
following
up
the
landlord
conciliatory
view
we
fond
of
our
old
clerk
it
and
him
used
to
be
such
a
singer
and
got
a
brother
as
is
known
for
the
first
fiddler
in
this
eh
it
a
pity
but
what
solomon
lived
in
our
village
and
could
give
us
a
tune
when
we
liked
eh
macey
i
keep
him
in
liver
and
lights
for
nothing
that
i
would
aye
aye
said
macey
in
the
height
of
complacency
our
been
known
for
musicianers
as
far
back
as
anybody
can
tell
but
them
things
are
dying
out
as
i
tell
solomon
every
time
he
comes
round
there
no
voices
like
what
there
used
to
be
and
there
nobody
remembers
what
we
remember
if
it
is
the
old
crows
aye
you
remember
when
first
lammeter
father
come
into
these
parts
do
you
mr
macey
said
the
landlord
i
should
think
i
did
said
the
old
man
who
had
now
gone
through
that
complimentary
process
necessary
to
bring
him
up
to
the
point
of
narration
and
a
fine
old
gentleman
he
was
as
fine
and
finer
nor
the
lammeter
as
now
is
he
came
from
a
bit
so
far
as
i
could
ever
make
out
but
there
nobody
rightly
knows
about
those
parts
only
it
could
be
far
nor
much
different
from
this
country
for
he
brought
a
fine
breed
o
sheep
with
him
so
there
must
be
pastures
there
and
everything
reasonable
we
heared
tell
as
sold
his
own
land
to
come
and
take
the
warrens
and
that
seemed
odd
for
a
man
as
had
land
of
his
own
to
come
and
rent
a
farm
in
a
strange
place
but
they
said
it
was
along
of
his
wife
dying
though
reasons
in
things
as
nobody
knows
on
that
pretty
much
what
i
made
out
yet
some
folks
are
so
wise
they
find
you
fifty
reasons
straight
off
and
all
the
while
the
real
reason
winking
at
in
the
corner
and
they
niver
howsomever
it
was
soon
seen
as
we
got
a
new
as
know
the
rights
and
customs
o
things
and
kep
a
good
house
and
was
well
looked
on
by
everybody
and
the
young
man
that
the
lammeter
as
now
is
for
he
niver
a
sister
soon
begun
to
court
miss
osgood
that
the
sister
o
the
osgood
as
now
is
and
a
fine
handsome
lass
she
was
eh
you
ca
think
they
pretend
this
young
lass
is
like
her
but
that
the
way
wi
people
as
know
what
come
before
should
know
for
i
helped
the
old
rector
drumlow
as
was
i
helped
him
marry
here
macey
paused
he
always
gave
his
narrative
in
instalments
expecting
to
be
questioned
according
to
precedent
aye
and
a
thing
happened
did
it
macey
so
as
you
were
likely
to
remember
that
marriage
said
the
landlord
in
a
congratulatory
tone
i
should
think
there
did
a
thing
said
macey
nodding
sideways
for
drumlow
poor
old
gentleman
i
was
fond
on
him
though
he
got
a
bit
confused
in
his
head
what
wi
age
and
taking
a
drop
o
summat
warm
when
the
service
come
of
a
cold
morning
and
young
lammeter
he
have
no
way
but
he
must
be
married
in
janiwary
which
to
be
sure
a
unreasonable
time
to
be
married
in
for
it
is
like
a
christening
or
a
burying
as
you
ca
help
and
so
drumlow
poor
old
gentleman
i
was
fond
on
him
but
when
he
come
to
put
the
questions
he
put
by
the
rule
o
contrairy
like
and
he
says
wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
thy
wedded
wife
says
he
and
then
he
says
wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wedded
husband
says
he
but
the
thing
of
all
is
as
nobody
took
any
notice
on
it
but
me
and
they
answered
straight
off
yes
like
as
if
it
had
been
me
saying
amen
i
the
right
place
without
listening
to
what
went
before
but
knew
what
was
going
on
well
enough
did
you
macey
you
were
live
enough
eh
said
the
butcher
lor
bless
you
said
macey
pausing
and
smiling
in
pity
at
the
impotence
of
his
hearer
imagination
why
i
was
all
of
a
tremble
it
was
as
if
i
been
a
coat
pulled
by
the
two
tails
like
for
i
stop
the
parson
i
could
take
upon
me
to
do
that
and
yet
i
said
to
myself
i
says
suppose
they
should
be
fast
married
the
words
are
contrairy
and
my
head
went
working
like
a
mill
for
i
was
allays
uncommon
for
turning
things
over
and
seeing
all
round
and
i
says
to
myself
the
meanin
or
the
words
as
makes
folks
fast
wedlock
for
the
parson
meant
right
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
meant
right
but
then
when
i
come
to
think
on
it
meanin
goes
but
a
little
way
i
most
things
for
you
may
mean
to
stick
things
together
and
your
glue
may
be
bad
and
then
where
are
you
and
so
i
says
to
mysen
it
is
the
meanin
it
the
glue
and
i
was
worreted
as
if
i
got
three
bells
to
pull
at
once
when
we
went
into
the
vestry
and
they
begun
to
sign
their
names
but
where
the
use
o
talking
you
ca
think
what
goes
on
in
a
man
inside
but
you
held
in
for
all
that
did
you
mr
macey
said
the
landlord
aye
i
held
in
tight
till
i
was
by
mysen
wi
drumlow
and
then
i
out
wi
everything
but
respectful
as
i
allays
did
and
he
made
light
on
it
and
he
says
pooh
pooh
macey
make
yourself
easy
he
says
it
neither
the
meaning
nor
the
words
it
the
does
it
that
the
glue
so
you
see
he
settled
it
easy
for
parsons
and
doctors
know
everything
by
heart
like
so
as
they
are
worreted
thinking
what
the
rights
and
wrongs
o
things
as
been
many
and
many
the
time
and
sure
enough
the
wedding
turned
out
all
right
poor
lammeter
that
miss
osgood
as
was
died
afore
the
lasses
was
growed
up
but
for
prosperity
and
everything
respectable
there
no
family
more
looked
on
every
one
of
macey
audience
had
heard
this
story
many
times
but
it
was
listened
to
as
if
it
had
been
a
favourite
tune
and
at
certain
points
the
puffing
of
the
pipes
was
momentarily
suspended
that
the
listeners
might
give
their
whole
minds
to
the
expected
words
but
there
was
more
to
come
and
snell
the
landlord
duly
put
the
leading
question
why
old
lammeter
had
a
pretty
fortin
did
they
say
when
he
come
into
these
parts
well
yes
said
macey
but
i
daresay
it
as
much
as
this
lammeter
done
to
keep
it
whole
for
there
was
allays
a
talk
as
nobody
could
get
rich
on
the
warrens
though
he
holds
it
cheap
for
it
what
they
call
charity
land
aye
and
there
few
folks
know
so
well
as
you
how
it
come
to
be
charity
land
eh
mr
macey
said
the
butcher
how
should
they
said
the
old
clerk
with
some
contempt
why
my
grandfather
made
the
grooms
livery
for
that
cliff
as
came
and
built
the
big
stables
at
the
warrens
why
they
stables
four
times
as
big
as
squire
cass
for
he
thought
o
nothing
but
hosses
and
hunting
cliff
did
a
lunnon
tailor
some
folks
said
as
had
gone
mad
wi
cheating
for
he
could
ride
lor
bless
you
they
said
got
no
more
grip
o
the
hoss
than
if
his
legs
had
been
my
grandfather
heared
old
squire
cass
say
so
many
and
many
a
time
but
ride
he
would
as
if
old
harry
had
been
him
and
he
a
son
a
lad
o
sixteen
and
nothing
would
his
father
have
him
do
but
he
must
ride
and
ride
though
the
lad
was
frighted
they
said
and
it
was
a
common
saying
as
the
father
wanted
to
ride
the
tailor
out
o
the
lad
and
make
a
gentleman
on
him
not
but
what
i
a
tailor
myself
but
in
respect
as
god
made
me
such
i
proud
on
it
for
macey
tailor
been
wrote
up
over
our
door
since
afore
the
queen
heads
went
out
on
the
shillings
but
cliff
he
was
ashamed
o
being
called
a
tailor
and
he
was
sore
vexed
as
his
riding
was
laughed
at
and
nobody
o
the
gentlefolks
hereabout
could
abide
him
howsomever
the
poor
lad
got
sickly
and
died
and
the
father
did
live
long
after
him
for
he
got
queerer
nor
ever
and
they
said
he
used
to
go
out
i
the
dead
o
the
night
wi
a
lantern
in
his
hand
to
the
stables
and
set
a
lot
lights
burning
for
he
got
as
he
could
sleep
and
there
he
stand
cracking
his
whip
and
looking
at
his
hosses
and
they
said
it
was
a
mercy
as
the
stables
did
get
burnt
down
wi
the
poor
dumb
creaturs
in
but
at
last
he
died
raving
and
they
found
as
he
left
all
his
property
warrens
and
all
to
a
lunnon
charity
and
that
how
the
warrens
come
to
be
charity
land
though
as
for
the
stables
lammeter
never
uses
they
out
o
all
charicter
lor
bless
you
if
you
was
to
set
the
doors
in
it
sound
like
thunder
half
the
parish
aye
but
there
more
going
on
in
the
stables
than
what
folks
see
by
daylight
eh
mr
macey
said
the
landlord
aye
aye
go
that
way
of
a
dark
night
that
all
said
macey
winking
mysteriously
and
then
make
believe
if
you
like
as
you
did
see
lights
i
the
stables
nor
hear
the
stamping
o
the
hosses
nor
the
cracking
o
the
whips
and
howling
too
if
it
daybreak
cliff
holiday
has
been
the
name
of
it
ever
sin
i
were
a
boy
that
to
say
some
said
as
it
was
the
holiday
old
harry
gev
him
from
roasting
like
that
what
my
father
told
me
and
he
was
a
reasonable
man
though
there
folks
nowadays
know
what
happened
afore
they
were
born
better
nor
they
know
their
own
business
what
do
you
say
to
that
eh
dowlas
said
the
landlord
turning
to
the
farrier
who
was
swelling
with
impatience
for
his
cue
there
a
nut
for
to
crack
dowlas
was
the
negative
spirit
in
the
company
and
was
proud
of
his
position
say
i
say
what
a
man
say
as
does
shut
his
eyes
to
look
at
a
i
say
as
i
ready
to
wager
any
man
ten
pound
if
he
stand
out
wi
me
any
dry
night
in
the
pasture
before
the
warren
stables
as
we
shall
neither
see
lights
nor
hear
noises
if
it
the
blowing
of
our
own
noses
that
what
i
say
and
i
said
it
many
a
time
but
there
nobody
ventur
a
note
on
their
as
they
make
so
sure
of
why
dowlas
that
easy
betting
that
is
said
ben
winthrop
you
might
as
well
bet
a
man
as
he
would
catch
the
rheumatise
if
he
stood
up
to
neck
in
the
pool
of
a
frosty
night
it
be
fine
fun
for
a
man
to
win
his
bet
as
he
catch
the
rheumatise
folks
as
believe
in
cliff
holiday
are
agoing
to
ventur
near
it
for
a
matter
o
ten
pound
if
master
dowlas
wants
to
know
the
truth
on
it
said
macey
with
a
sarcastic
smile
tapping
his
thumbs
together
he
no
call
to
lay
any
bet
let
him
go
and
stan
by
himself
there
nobody
hinder
him
and
then
he
can
let
the
know
if
they
wrong
thank
you
i
obliged
to
you
said
the
farrier
with
a
snort
of
scorn
if
folks
are
fools
it
no
business
o
mine
do
want
to
make
out
the
truth
about
i
know
it
but
i
not
against
a
bet
everything
fair
and
open
let
any
man
bet
me
ten
pound
as
i
shall
see
cliff
holiday
and
i
go
and
stand
by
myself
i
want
no
company
i
as
lief
do
it
as
i
fill
this
pipe
ah
but
who
to
watch
you
dowlas
and
see
you
do
it
that
no
fair
bet
said
the
butcher
no
fair
bet
replied
dowlas
angrily
i
should
like
to
hear
any
man
stand
up
and
say
i
want
to
bet
unfair
come
now
master
lundy
i
should
like
to
hear
you
say
it
very
like
you
would
said
the
butcher
but
it
no
business
mine
you
none
o
my
bargains
and
i
are
to
try
and
your
price
if
anybody
bid
for
you
at
your
own
vallying
let
him
i
for
peace
and
quietness
i
am
yes
that
what
every
yapping
cur
is
when
you
hold
a
stick
up
at
him
said
the
farrier
but
i
afraid
o
neither
man
nor
ghost
and
i
ready
to
lay
a
fair
bet
are
a
cur
aye
but
there
this
in
it
dowlas
said
the
landlord
speaking
in
a
tone
of
much
candour
and
tolerance
there
folks
i
my
opinion
they
ca
see
not
if
they
stood
as
plain
as
a
before
and
there
reason
i
that
for
there
my
wife
now
ca
smell
not
if
she
the
strongest
o
cheese
under
her
nose
i
never
see
a
ghost
myself
but
then
i
says
to
myself
very
like
i
have
got
the
smell
for
i
mean
putting
a
ghost
for
a
smell
or
else
contrairiways
and
so
i
for
holding
with
both
sides
for
as
i
say
the
truth
lies
between
and
if
dowlas
was
to
go
and
stand
and
say
he
never
seen
a
wink
o
cliff
holiday
all
the
night
through
i
back
him
and
if
anybody
said
as
cliff
holiday
was
certain
sure
for
all
that
i
back
too
for
the
smell
what
i
go
by
the
landlord
analogical
argument
was
not
well
received
by
the
farrier
a
man
intensely
opposed
to
compromise
tut
tut
he
said
setting
down
his
glass
with
refreshed
irritation
what
the
smell
got
to
do
with
it
did
ever
a
ghost
give
a
man
a
black
eye
that
what
i
should
like
to
know
if
want
me
to
believe
in
let
leave
off
skulking
i
the
dark
and
i
lone
places
let
come
where
there
company
and
candles
as
if
want
to
be
believed
in
by
anybody
so
ignirant
said
macey
in
deep
disgust
at
the
farrier
crass
incompetence
to
apprehend
the
conditions
of
ghostly
phenomena
chapter
vii
yet
the
next
moment
there
seemed
to
be
some
evidence
that
ghosts
had
a
more
condescending
disposition
than
macey
attributed
to
them
for
the
pale
thin
figure
of
silas
marner
was
suddenly
seen
standing
in
the
warm
light
uttering
no
word
but
looking
round
at
the
company
with
his
strange
unearthly
eyes
the
long
pipes
gave
a
simultaneous
movement
like
the
antennae
of
startled
insects
and
every
man
present
not
excepting
even
the
sceptical
farrier
had
an
impression
that
he
saw
not
silas
marner
in
the
flesh
but
an
apparition
for
the
door
by
which
silas
had
entered
was
hidden
by
the
seats
and
no
one
had
noticed
his
approach
macey
sitting
a
long
way
off
the
ghost
might
be
supposed
to
have
felt
an
argumentative
triumph
which
would
tend
to
neutralize
his
share
of
the
general
alarm
had
he
not
always
said
that
when
silas
marner
was
in
that
strange
trance
of
his
his
soul
went
loose
from
his
body
here
was
the
demonstration
nevertheless
on
the
whole
he
would
have
been
as
well
contented
without
it
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
dead
silence
marner
want
of
breath
and
agitation
not
allowing
him
to
speak
the
landlord
under
the
habitual
sense
that
he
was
bound
to
keep
his
house
open
to
all
company
and
confident
in
the
protection
of
his
unbroken
neutrality
at
last
took
on
himself
the
task
of
adjuring
the
ghost
master
marner
he
said
in
a
conciliatory
tone
what
lacking
to
you
what
your
business
here
robbed
said
silas
gaspingly
i
been
robbed
i
want
the
constable
and
the
justice
and
squire
cass
and
mr
crackenthorp
lay
hold
on
him
jem
rodney
said
the
landlord
the
idea
of
a
ghost
subsiding
he
off
his
head
i
doubt
he
wet
through
jem
rodney
was
the
outermost
man
and
sat
conveniently
near
but
he
declined
to
give
his
services
come
and
lay
hold
on
him
yourself
snell
if
you
a
mind
said
jem
rather
sullenly
he
been
robbed
and
murdered
too
for
what
i
know
he
added
in
a
muttering
tone
jem
rodney
said
silas
turning
and
fixing
his
strange
eyes
on
the
suspected
man
aye
master
marner
what
do
you
want
wi
me
said
jem
trembling
a
little
and
seizing
his
as
a
defensive
weapon
if
it
was
you
stole
my
money
said
silas
clasping
his
hands
entreatingly
and
raising
his
voice
to
a
cry
give
it
me
back
and
i
wo
meddle
with
you
i
wo
set
the
constable
on
you
give
it
me
back
and
i
let
you
i
let
you
have
a
guinea
me
stole
your
money
said
jem
angrily
i
pitch
this
can
at
your
eye
if
you
talk
o
stealing
your
money
come
come
master
marner
said
the
landlord
now
rising
resolutely
and
seizing
marner
by
the
shoulder
if
you
got
any
information
to
lay
speak
it
out
sensible
and
show
as
you
in
your
right
mind
if
you
expect
anybody
to
listen
to
you
you
as
wet
as
a
drownded
rat
sit
down
and
dry
yourself
and
speak
straight
forrard
ah
to
be
sure
man
said
the
farrier
who
began
to
feel
that
he
had
not
been
quite
on
a
par
with
himself
and
the
occasion
let
have
no
more
staring
and
screaming
else
we
have
you
strapped
for
a
madman
that
was
why
i
did
speak
at
the
first
thinks
i
the
man
run
mad
aye
aye
make
him
sit
down
said
several
voices
at
once
well
pleased
that
the
reality
of
ghosts
remained
still
an
open
question
the
landlord
forced
marner
to
take
off
his
coat
and
then
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
aloof
from
every
one
else
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
and
in
the
direct
rays
of
the
fire
the
weaver
too
feeble
to
have
any
distinct
purpose
beyond
that
of
getting
help
to
recover
his
money
submitted
unresistingly
the
transient
fears
of
the
company
were
now
forgotten
in
their
strong
curiosity
and
all
faces
were
turned
towards
silas
when
the
landlord
having
seated
himself
again
said
now
then
master
marner
what
this
you
got
to
say
as
you
been
robbed
speak
out
he
better
not
say
again
as
it
was
me
robbed
him
cried
jem
rodney
hastily
what
could
i
ha
done
with
his
money
i
could
as
easy
steal
the
parson
surplice
and
wear
it
hold
your
tongue
jem
and
let
hear
what
he
got
to
say
said
the
landlord
now
then
master
marner
silas
now
told
his
story
under
frequent
questioning
as
the
mysterious
character
of
the
robbery
became
evident
this
strangely
novel
situation
of
opening
his
trouble
to
his
raveloe
neighbours
of
sitting
in
the
warmth
of
a
hearth
not
his
own
and
feeling
the
presence
of
faces
and
voices
which
were
his
nearest
promise
of
help
had
doubtless
its
influence
on
marner
in
spite
of
his
passionate
preoccupation
with
his
loss
our
consciousness
rarely
registers
the
beginning
of
a
growth
within
us
any
more
than
without
us
there
have
been
many
circulations
of
the
sap
before
we
detect
the
smallest
sign
of
the
bud
the
slight
suspicion
with
which
his
hearers
at
first
listened
to
him
gradually
melted
away
before
the
convincing
simplicity
of
his
distress
it
was
impossible
for
the
neighbours
to
doubt
that
marner
was
telling
the
truth
not
because
they
were
capable
of
arguing
at
once
from
the
nature
of
his
statements
to
the
absence
of
any
motive
for
making
them
falsely
but
because
as
macey
observed
folks
as
had
the
devil
to
back
were
not
likely
to
be
so
mushed
as
poor
silas
was
rather
from
the
strange
fact
that
the
robber
had
left
no
traces
and
had
happened
to
know
the
nick
of
time
utterly
incalculable
by
mortal
agents
when
silas
would
go
away
from
home
without
locking
his
door
the
more
probable
conclusion
seemed
to
be
that
his
disreputable
intimacy
in
that
quarter
if
it
ever
existed
had
been
broken
up
and
that
in
consequence
this
ill
turn
had
been
done
to
marner
by
somebody
it
was
quite
in
vain
to
set
the
constable
after
why
this
preternatural
felon
should
be
obliged
to
wait
till
the
door
was
left
unlocked
was
a
question
which
did
not
present
itself
it
is
jem
rodney
as
has
done
this
work
master
marner
said
the
landlord
you
must
be
your
eye
at
poor
jem
there
may
be
a
bit
of
a
reckoning
against
jem
for
the
matter
of
a
hare
or
so
if
anybody
was
bound
to
keep
their
eyes
staring
open
and
niver
to
wink
but
jem
been
here
drinking
his
can
like
the
decentest
man
i
the
parish
since
before
you
left
your
house
master
marner
by
your
own
account
aye
aye
said
macey
let
have
no
accusing
o
the
innicent
that
is
the
law
there
must
be
folks
to
swear
again
a
man
before
he
can
be
up
let
have
no
accusing
o
the
innicent
master
marner
memory
was
not
so
utterly
torpid
in
silas
that
it
could
not
be
awakened
by
these
words
with
a
movement
of
compunction
as
new
and
strange
to
him
as
everything
else
within
the
last
hour
he
started
from
his
chair
and
went
close
up
to
jem
looking
at
him
as
if
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
of
the
expression
in
his
face
i
was
wrong
he
said
yes
yes
i
ought
to
have
thought
nothing
to
witness
against
you
jem
only
you
been
into
my
house
oftener
than
anybody
else
and
so
you
came
into
my
head
i
do
accuse
you
i
wo
accuse
anybody
only
he
added
lifting
up
his
hands
to
his
head
and
turning
away
with
bewildered
misery
i
try
i
try
to
think
where
my
guineas
can
be
aye
aye
they
gone
where
it
hot
enough
to
melt
i
doubt
said
macey
tchuh
said
the
farrier
and
then
he
asked
with
a
air
how
much
money
might
there
be
in
the
bags
master
marner
two
hundred
and
pounds
twelve
and
sixpence
last
night
when
i
counted
it
said
silas
seating
himself
again
with
a
groan
pooh
why
they
be
none
so
heavy
to
carry
some
tramp
been
in
that
all
and
as
for
the
no
footmarks
and
the
bricks
and
the
sand
being
all
right
why
your
eyes
are
pretty
much
like
a
insect
master
marner
they
obliged
to
look
so
close
you
ca
see
much
at
a
time
it
my
opinion
as
if
i
been
you
or
you
been
me
for
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
you
would
have
thought
you
found
everything
as
you
left
it
but
what
i
vote
is
as
two
of
the
sensiblest
o
the
company
should
go
with
you
to
master
kench
the
constable
he
ill
i
bed
i
know
that
much
and
get
him
to
appoint
one
of
us
his
deppity
for
that
the
law
and
i
do
think
anybody
take
upon
him
to
contradick
me
there
it
is
much
of
a
walk
to
kench
and
then
if
it
me
as
is
deppity
i
go
back
with
you
master
marner
and
examine
your
premises
and
if
anybody
got
any
fault
to
find
with
that
i
thank
him
to
stand
up
and
say
it
out
like
a
man
by
this
pregnant
speech
the
farrier
had
his
and
waited
with
confidence
to
hear
himself
named
as
one
of
the
superlatively
sensible
men
let
us
see
how
the
night
is
though
said
the
landlord
who
also
considered
himself
personally
concerned
in
this
proposition
why
it
rains
heavy
still
he
said
returning
from
the
door
well
i
not
the
man
to
be
afraid
o
the
rain
said
the
farrier
for
it
look
bad
when
justice
malam
hears
as
respectable
men
like
us
had
a
information
laid
before
and
took
no
steps
the
landlord
agreed
with
this
view
and
after
taking
the
sense
of
the
company
and
duly
rehearsing
a
small
ceremony
known
in
high
ecclesiastical
life
as
the
he
consented
to
take
on
himself
the
chill
dignity
of
going
to
kench
but
to
the
strong
disgust
macey
now
started
an
objection
to
his
proposing
himself
as
a
for
that
oracular
old
gentleman
claiming
to
know
the
law
stated
as
a
fact
delivered
to
him
by
his
father
that
no
doctor
could
be
a
constable
and
you
a
doctor
i
reckon
though
you
only
a
for
a
fly
a
fly
though
it
may
be
a
concluded
macey
wondering
a
little
at
his
own
there
was
a
hot
debate
upon
this
the
farrier
being
of
course
indisposed
to
renounce
the
quality
of
doctor
but
contending
that
a
doctor
could
be
a
constable
if
he
liked
the
law
meant
he
need
be
one
if
he
did
like
macey
thought
this
was
nonsense
since
the
law
was
not
likely
to
be
fonder
of
doctors
than
of
other
folks
moreover
if
it
was
in
the
nature
of
doctors
more
than
of
other
men
not
to
like
being
constables
how
came
dowlas
to
be
so
eager
to
act
in
that
capacity
do
want
to
act
the
constable
said
the
farrier
driven
into
a
corner
by
this
merciless
reasoning
and
there
no
man
can
say
it
of
me
if
he
tell
the
truth
but
if
there
to
be
any
jealousy
and
about
going
to
kench
in
the
rain
let
them
go
as
like
it
you
wo
get
me
to
go
i
can
tell
you
by
the
landlord
intervention
however
the
dispute
was
accommodated
dowlas
consented
to
go
as
a
second
person
disinclined
to
act
officially
and
so
poor
silas
furnished
with
some
old
coverings
turned
out
with
his
two
companions
into
the
rain
again
thinking
of
the
long
before
him
not
as
those
do
who
long
to
rest
but
as
those
who
expect
to
watch
for
the
morning
chapter
viii
when
godfrey
cass
returned
from
osgood
party
at
midnight
he
was
not
much
surprised
to
learn
that
dunsey
had
not
come
home
perhaps
he
had
not
sold
wildfire
and
was
waiting
for
another
chance
perhaps
on
that
foggy
afternoon
he
had
preferred
housing
himself
at
the
red
lion
at
batherley
for
the
night
if
the
run
had
kept
him
in
that
neighbourhood
for
he
was
not
likely
to
feel
much
concern
about
leaving
his
brother
in
suspense
godfrey
mind
was
too
full
of
nancy
lammeter
looks
and
behaviour
too
full
of
the
exasperation
against
himself
and
his
lot
which
the
sight
of
her
always
produced
in
him
for
him
to
give
much
thought
to
wildfire
or
to
the
probabilities
of
dunstan
conduct
the
next
morning
the
whole
village
was
excited
by
the
story
of
the
robbery
and
godfrey
like
every
one
else
was
occupied
in
gathering
and
discussing
news
about
it
and
in
visiting
the
the
rain
had
washed
away
all
possibility
of
distinguishing
but
a
close
investigation
of
the
spot
had
disclosed
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
village
a
with
a
flint
and
steel
half
sunk
in
the
mud
it
was
not
silas
for
the
only
one
he
had
ever
had
was
still
standing
on
his
shelf
and
the
inference
generally
accepted
was
that
the
in
the
ditch
was
somehow
connected
with
the
robbery
a
small
minority
shook
their
heads
and
intimated
their
opinion
that
it
was
not
a
robbery
to
have
much
light
thrown
on
it
by
that
master
marner
tale
had
a
queer
look
with
it
and
that
such
things
had
been
known
as
a
man
doing
himself
a
mischief
and
then
setting
the
justice
to
look
for
the
doer
but
when
questioned
closely
as
to
their
grounds
for
this
opinion
and
what
master
marner
had
to
gain
by
such
false
pretences
they
only
shook
their
heads
as
before
and
observed
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
some
folks
counted
gain
moreover
that
everybody
had
a
right
to
their
own
opinions
grounds
or
no
grounds
and
that
the
weaver
as
everybody
knew
was
partly
crazy
macey
though
he
joined
in
the
defence
of
marner
against
all
suspicions
of
deceit
also
the
indeed
repudiated
it
as
a
rather
impious
suggestion
tending
to
imply
that
everything
must
be
done
by
human
hands
and
that
there
was
no
power
which
could
make
away
with
the
guineas
without
moving
the
bricks
nevertheless
he
turned
round
rather
sharply
on
tookey
when
the
zealous
deputy
feeling
that
this
was
a
view
of
the
case
peculiarly
suited
to
a
carried
it
still
farther
and
doubted
whether
it
was
right
to
inquire
into
a
robbery
at
all
when
the
circumstances
were
so
mysterious
as
if
concluded
tookey
as
if
there
was
nothing
but
what
could
be
made
out
by
justices
and
constables
now
do
you
be
for
overshooting
the
mark
tookey
said
macey
nodding
his
head
aside
admonishingly
that
what
you
allays
at
if
i
throw
a
stone
and
hit
you
think
there
summat
better
than
hitting
and
you
try
to
throw
a
stone
beyond
what
i
said
was
against
the
i
said
nothing
against
justices
and
constables
for
they
o
king
george
making
and
it
be
a
man
in
a
parish
office
to
fly
out
again
king
george
while
these
discussions
were
going
on
amongst
the
group
outside
the
rainbow
a
higher
consultation
was
being
carried
on
within
under
the
presidency
of
crackenthorp
the
rector
assisted
by
squire
cass
and
other
substantial
parishioners
it
had
just
occurred
to
snell
the
landlord
he
being
as
he
observed
a
man
accustomed
to
put
two
and
two
together
to
connect
with
the
which
as
he
himself
had
had
the
honourable
distinction
of
finding
certain
recollections
of
a
pedlar
who
had
called
to
drink
at
the
house
about
a
month
before
and
had
actually
stated
that
he
carried
a
about
with
him
to
light
his
pipe
here
surely
was
a
clue
to
be
followed
out
and
as
memory
when
duly
impregnated
with
ascertained
facts
is
sometimes
surprisingly
fertile
snell
gradually
recovered
a
vivid
impression
of
the
effect
produced
on
him
by
the
countenance
and
conversation
he
had
a
look
with
his
eye
which
fell
unpleasantly
on
snell
sensitive
organism
to
be
sure
he
say
anything
particular
no
except
that
about
the
but
it
is
what
a
man
says
it
the
way
he
says
it
moreover
he
had
a
swarthy
foreignness
of
complexion
which
boded
little
honesty
did
he
wear
crackenthorp
wished
to
know
having
some
acquaintance
with
foreign
customs
well
stay
let
me
see
said
snell
like
a
docile
clairvoyante
who
would
really
not
make
a
mistake
if
she
could
help
it
after
stretching
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
contracting
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
trying
to
see
the
he
appeared
to
give
up
the
effort
and
said
well
he
got
in
his
box
to
sell
so
it
to
suppose
he
might
wear
but
he
called
at
every
house
in
the
village
there
somebody
else
mayhap
saw
in
his
ears
though
i
ca
take
upon
me
rightly
to
say
snell
was
correct
in
his
surmise
that
somebody
else
would
remember
the
pedlar
for
on
the
spread
of
inquiry
among
the
villagers
it
was
stated
with
gathering
emphasis
that
the
parson
had
wanted
to
know
whether
the
pedlar
wore
in
his
ears
and
an
impression
was
created
that
a
great
deal
depended
on
the
eliciting
of
this
fact
of
course
every
one
who
heard
the
question
not
having
any
distinct
image
of
the
pedlar
as
immediately
had
an
image
of
him
larger
or
smaller
as
the
case
might
be
and
the
image
was
presently
taken
for
a
vivid
recollection
so
that
the
glazier
wife
a
woman
not
given
to
lying
and
whose
house
was
among
the
cleanest
in
the
village
was
ready
to
declare
as
sure
as
ever
she
meant
to
take
the
sacrament
the
very
next
christmas
that
was
ever
coming
that
she
had
seen
big
in
the
shape
of
the
young
moon
in
the
pedlar
two
ears
while
jinny
oates
the
cobbler
daughter
being
a
more
imaginative
person
stated
not
only
that
she
had
seen
them
too
but
that
they
had
made
her
blood
creep
as
it
did
at
that
very
moment
while
there
she
stood
also
by
way
of
throwing
further
light
on
this
clue
of
the
a
collection
was
made
of
all
the
articles
purchased
from
the
pedlar
at
various
houses
and
carried
to
the
rainbow
to
be
exhibited
there
in
fact
there
was
a
general
feeling
in
the
village
that
for
the
of
this
robbery
there
must
be
a
great
deal
done
at
the
rainbow
and
that
no
man
need
offer
his
wife
an
excuse
for
going
there
while
it
was
the
scene
of
severe
public
duties
some
disappointment
was
felt
and
perhaps
a
little
indignation
also
when
it
became
known
that
silas
marner
on
being
questioned
by
the
squire
and
the
parson
had
retained
no
other
recollection
of
the
pedlar
than
that
he
had
called
at
his
door
but
had
not
entered
his
house
having
turned
away
at
once
when
silas
holding
the
door
ajar
had
said
that
he
wanted
nothing
this
had
been
silas
testimony
though
he
clutched
strongly
at
the
idea
of
the
pedlar
being
the
culprit
if
only
because
it
gave
him
a
definite
image
of
a
whereabout
for
his
gold
after
it
had
been
taken
away
from
its
he
could
see
it
now
in
the
pedlar
box
but
it
was
observed
with
some
irritation
in
the
village
that
anybody
but
a
blind
creatur
like
marner
would
have
seen
the
man
prowling
about
for
how
came
he
to
leave
his
in
the
ditch
close
by
if
he
had
been
lingering
there
doubtless
he
had
made
his
observations
when
he
saw
marner
at
the
door
anybody
might
know
and
only
look
at
him
that
the
weaver
was
a
miser
it
was
a
wonder
the
pedlar
had
murdered
him
men
of
that
sort
with
rings
in
their
ears
had
been
known
for
murderers
often
and
often
there
had
been
one
tried
at
the
not
so
long
ago
but
what
there
were
people
living
who
remembered
it
godfrey
cass
indeed
entering
the
rainbow
during
one
of
frequently
repeated
recitals
of
his
testimony
had
treated
it
lightly
stating
that
he
himself
had
bought
a
of
the
pedlar
and
thought
him
a
merry
grinning
fellow
enough
it
was
all
nonsense
he
said
about
the
man
evil
looks
but
this
was
spoken
of
in
the
village
as
the
random
talk
of
youth
as
if
it
was
only
snell
who
had
seen
something
odd
about
the
pedlar
on
the
contrary
there
were
at
least
who
were
ready
to
go
before
justice
malam
and
give
in
much
more
striking
testimony
than
any
the
landlord
could
furnish
it
was
to
be
hoped
godfrey
would
not
go
to
tarley
and
throw
cold
water
on
what
snell
said
there
and
so
prevent
the
justice
from
drawing
up
a
warrant
he
was
suspected
of
intending
this
when
after
he
was
seen
setting
off
on
horseback
in
the
direction
of
tarley
but
by
this
time
godfrey
interest
in
the
robbery
had
faded
before
his
growing
anxiety
about
dunstan
and
wildfire
and
he
was
going
not
to
tarley
but
to
batherley
unable
to
rest
in
uncertainty
about
them
any
longer
the
possibility
that
dunstan
had
played
him
the
ugly
trick
of
riding
away
with
wildfire
to
return
at
the
end
of
a
month
when
he
had
gambled
away
or
otherwise
squandered
the
price
of
the
horse
was
a
fear
that
urged
itself
upon
him
more
even
than
the
thought
of
an
accidental
injury
and
now
that
the
dance
at
osgood
was
past
he
was
irritated
with
himself
that
he
had
trusted
his
horse
to
dunstan
instead
of
trying
to
still
his
fears
he
encouraged
them
with
that
superstitious
impression
which
clings
to
us
all
that
if
we
expect
evil
very
strongly
it
is
the
less
likely
to
come
and
when
he
heard
a
horse
approaching
at
a
trot
and
saw
a
hat
rising
above
a
hedge
beyond
an
angle
of
the
lane
he
felt
as
if
his
conjuration
had
succeeded
but
no
sooner
did
the
horse
come
within
sight
than
his
heart
sank
again
it
was
not
wildfire
and
in
a
few
moments
more
he
discerned
that
the
rider
was
not
dunstan
but
bryce
who
pulled
up
to
speak
with
a
face
that
implied
something
disagreeable
well
godfrey
that
a
lucky
brother
of
yours
that
master
dunsey
is
he
what
do
you
mean
said
godfrey
hastily
why
has
he
been
home
yet
said
bryce
home
no
what
has
happened
be
quick
what
has
he
done
with
my
horse
ah
i
thought
it
was
yours
though
he
pretended
you
had
parted
with
it
to
him
has
he
thrown
him
down
and
broken
his
knees
said
godfrey
flushed
with
exasperation
worse
than
that
said
bryce
you
see
i
made
a
bargain
with
him
to
buy
the
horse
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
a
swinging
price
but
i
always
liked
the
horse
and
what
does
he
do
but
go
and
stake
him
fly
at
a
hedge
with
stakes
in
it
atop
of
a
bank
with
a
ditch
before
it
the
horse
had
been
dead
a
pretty
good
while
when
he
was
found
so
he
has
been
home
since
has
he
home
no
said
godfrey
and
he
better
keep
away
confound
me
for
a
fool
i
might
have
known
this
would
be
the
end
of
it
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
bryce
after
i
bargained
for
the
horse
it
did
come
into
my
head
that
he
might
be
riding
and
selling
the
horse
without
your
knowledge
for
i
did
believe
it
was
his
own
i
knew
master
dunsey
was
up
to
his
tricks
sometimes
but
where
can
he
be
gone
he
never
been
seen
at
batherley
he
could
have
been
hurt
for
he
must
have
walked
off
hurt
said
godfrey
bitterly
he
never
be
hurt
he
made
to
hurt
other
people
and
so
you
give
him
leave
to
sell
the
horse
eh
said
bryce
yes
i
wanted
to
part
with
the
horse
he
was
always
a
little
too
hard
in
the
mouth
for
me
said
godfrey
his
pride
making
him
wince
under
the
idea
that
bryce
guessed
the
sale
to
be
a
matter
of
necessity
i
was
going
to
see
after
him
i
thought
some
mischief
had
happened
go
back
now
he
added
turning
the
horse
head
and
wishing
he
could
get
rid
of
bryce
for
he
felt
that
the
crisis
in
his
life
was
close
upon
him
you
coming
on
to
raveloe
are
you
well
no
not
now
said
bryce
i
coming
round
there
for
i
had
to
go
to
flitton
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
take
you
in
my
way
and
just
let
you
know
all
i
knew
myself
about
the
horse
i
suppose
master
dunsey
did
like
to
show
himself
till
the
ill
news
had
blown
over
a
bit
he
perhaps
gone
to
pay
a
visit
at
the
three
crowns
by
whitbridge
i
know
he
fond
of
the
house
perhaps
he
is
said
godfrey
rather
absently
then
rousing
himself
he
said
with
an
effort
at
carelessness
we
shall
hear
of
him
soon
enough
i
be
bound
well
here
my
turning
said
bryce
not
surprised
to
perceive
that
godfrey
was
rather
down
so
i
bid
you
and
wish
i
may
bring
you
better
news
another
time
godfrey
rode
along
slowly
representing
to
himself
the
scene
of
confession
to
his
father
from
which
he
felt
that
there
was
now
no
longer
any
escape
the
revelation
about
the
money
must
be
made
the
very
next
morning
and
if
he
withheld
the
rest
dunstan
would
be
sure
to
come
back
shortly
and
finding
that
he
must
bear
the
brunt
of
his
father
anger
would
tell
the
whole
story
out
of
spite
even
though
he
had
nothing
to
gain
by
it
there
was
one
step
perhaps
by
which
he
might
still
win
dunstan
silence
and
put
off
the
evil
day
he
might
tell
his
father
that
he
had
himself
spent
the
money
paid
to
him
by
fowler
and
as
he
had
never
been
guilty
of
such
an
offence
before
the
affair
would
blow
over
after
a
little
storming
but
godfrey
could
not
bend
himself
to
this
he
felt
that
in
letting
dunstan
have
the
money
he
had
already
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
trust
hardly
less
culpable
than
that
of
spending
the
money
directly
for
his
own
behoof
and
yet
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
two
acts
which
made
him
feel
that
the
one
was
so
much
more
blackening
than
the
other
as
to
be
intolerable
to
him
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
good
fellow
he
said
to
himself
but
i
not
a
scoundrel
at
least
i
stop
short
somewhere
i
bear
the
consequences
of
what
i
done
sooner
than
make
believe
i
done
what
i
never
would
have
done
i
never
have
spent
the
money
for
my
own
pleasure
i
was
tortured
into
it
through
the
remainder
of
this
day
godfrey
with
only
occasional
fluctuations
kept
his
will
bent
in
the
direction
of
a
complete
avowal
to
his
father
and
he
withheld
the
story
of
wildfire
loss
till
the
next
morning
that
it
might
serve
him
as
an
introduction
to
heavier
matter
the
old
squire
was
accustomed
to
his
son
frequent
absence
from
home
and
thought
neither
dunstan
nor
wildfire
a
matter
calling
for
remark
godfrey
said
to
himself
again
and
again
that
if
he
let
slip
this
one
opportunity
of
confession
he
might
never
have
another
the
revelation
might
be
made
even
in
a
more
odious
way
than
by
dunstan
malignity
might
come
as
she
had
threatened
to
do
and
then
he
tried
to
make
the
scene
easier
to
himself
by
rehearsal
he
made
up
his
mind
how
he
would
pass
from
the
admission
of
his
weakness
in
letting
dunstan
have
the
money
to
the
fact
that
dunstan
had
a
hold
on
him
which
he
had
been
unable
to
shake
off
and
how
he
would
work
up
his
father
to
expect
something
very
bad
before
he
told
him
the
fact
the
old
squire
was
an
implacable
man
he
made
resolutions
in
violent
anger
and
he
was
not
to
be
moved
from
them
after
his
anger
had
subsided
as
fiery
volcanic
matters
cool
and
harden
into
rock
like
many
violent
and
implacable
men
he
allowed
evils
to
grow
under
favour
of
his
own
heedlessness
till
they
pressed
upon
him
with
exasperating
force
and
then
he
turned
round
with
fierce
severity
and
became
unrelentingly
hard
this
was
his
system
with
his
tenants
he
allowed
them
to
get
into
arrears
neglect
their
fences
reduce
their
stock
sell
their
straw
and
otherwise
go
the
wrong
way
and
then
when
he
became
short
of
money
in
consequence
of
this
indulgence
he
took
the
hardest
measures
and
would
listen
to
no
appeal
godfrey
knew
all
this
and
felt
it
with
the
greater
force
because
he
had
constantly
suffered
annoyance
from
witnessing
his
father
sudden
fits
of
unrelentingness
for
which
his
own
habitual
irresolution
deprived
him
of
all
sympathy
he
was
not
critical
on
the
faulty
indulgence
which
preceded
these
fits
seemed
to
him
natural
enough
still
there
was
just
the
chance
godfrey
thought
that
his
father
pride
might
see
this
marriage
in
a
light
that
would
induce
him
to
hush
it
up
rather
than
turn
his
son
out
and
make
the
family
the
talk
of
the
country
for
ten
miles
round
this
was
the
view
of
the
case
that
godfrey
managed
to
keep
before
him
pretty
closely
till
midnight
and
he
went
to
sleep
thinking
that
he
had
done
with
inward
debating
but
when
he
awoke
in
the
still
morning
darkness
he
found
it
impossible
to
reawaken
his
evening
thoughts
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
tired
out
and
were
not
to
be
roused
to
further
work
instead
of
arguments
for
confession
he
could
now
feel
the
presence
of
nothing
but
its
evil
consequences
the
old
dread
of
disgrace
came
back
the
old
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
raising
a
hopeless
barrier
between
himself
and
nancy
the
old
disposition
to
rely
on
chances
which
might
be
favourable
to
him
and
save
him
from
betrayal
why
after
all
should
he
cut
off
the
hope
of
them
by
his
own
act
he
had
seen
the
matter
in
a
wrong
light
yesterday
he
had
been
in
a
rage
with
dunstan
and
had
thought
of
nothing
but
a
thorough
of
their
mutual
understanding
but
what
it
would
be
really
wisest
for
him
to
do
was
to
try
and
soften
his
father
anger
against
dunsey
and
keep
things
as
nearly
as
possible
in
their
old
condition
if
dunsey
did
not
come
back
for
a
few
days
and
godfrey
did
not
know
but
that
the
rascal
had
enough
money
in
his
pocket
to
enable
him
to
keep
away
still
longer
everything
might
blow
over
chapter
ix
godfrey
rose
and
took
his
own
breakfast
earlier
than
usual
but
lingered
in
the
wainscoted
parlour
till
his
younger
brothers
had
finished
their
meal
and
gone
out
awaiting
his
father
who
always
took
a
walk
with
his
before
breakfast
every
one
breakfasted
at
a
different
hour
in
the
red
house
and
the
squire
was
always
the
latest
giving
a
long
chance
to
a
rather
feeble
morning
appetite
before
he
tried
it
the
table
had
been
spread
with
substantial
eatables
nearly
two
hours
before
he
presented
himself
a
tall
stout
man
of
sixty
with
a
face
in
which
the
knit
brow
and
rather
hard
glance
seemed
contradicted
by
the
slack
and
feeble
mouth
his
person
showed
marks
of
habitual
neglect
his
dress
was
slovenly
and
yet
there
was
something
in
the
presence
of
the
old
squire
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
ordinary
farmers
in
the
parish
who
were
perhaps
every
whit
as
refined
as
he
but
having
slouched
their
way
through
life
with
a
consciousness
of
being
in
the
vicinity
of
their
betters
wanted
that
and
authoritativeness
of
voice
and
carriage
which
belonged
to
a
man
who
thought
of
superiors
as
remote
existences
with
whom
he
had
personally
little
more
to
do
than
with
america
or
the
stars
the
squire
had
been
used
to
parish
homage
all
his
life
used
to
the
presupposition
that
his
family
his
tankards
and
everything
that
was
his
were
the
oldest
and
best
and
as
he
never
associated
with
any
gentry
higher
than
himself
his
opinion
was
not
disturbed
by
comparison
he
glanced
at
his
son
as
he
entered
the
room
and
said
what
sir
have
had
your
breakfast
yet
but
there
was
no
pleasant
morning
greeting
between
them
not
because
of
any
unfriendliness
but
because
the
sweet
flower
of
courtesy
is
not
a
growth
of
such
homes
as
the
red
house
yes
sir
said
godfrey
i
had
my
breakfast
but
i
was
waiting
to
speak
to
you
ah
well
said
the
squire
throwing
himself
indifferently
into
his
chair
and
speaking
in
a
ponderous
coughing
fashion
which
was
felt
in
raveloe
to
be
a
sort
of
privilege
of
his
rank
while
he
cut
a
piece
of
beef
and
held
it
up
before
the
that
had
come
in
with
him
ring
the
bell
for
my
ale
will
you
you
youngsters
business
is
your
own
pleasure
mostly
there
no
hurry
about
it
for
anybody
but
yourselves
the
squire
life
was
quite
as
idle
as
his
sons
but
it
was
a
fiction
kept
up
by
himself
and
his
contemporaries
in
raveloe
that
youth
was
exclusively
the
period
of
folly
and
that
their
aged
wisdom
was
constantly
in
a
state
of
endurance
mitigated
by
sarcasm
godfrey
waited
before
he
spoke
again
until
the
ale
had
been
brought
and
the
door
closed
an
interval
during
which
fleet
the
had
consumed
enough
bits
of
beef
to
make
a
poor
man
holiday
dinner
there
been
a
cursed
piece
of
with
wildfire
he
began
happened
the
day
before
yesterday
what
broke
his
knees
said
the
squire
after
taking
a
draught
of
ale
i
thought
you
knew
how
to
ride
better
than
that
sir
i
never
threw
a
horse
down
in
my
life
if
i
had
i
might
ha
whistled
for
another
for
father
was
quite
so
ready
to
unstring
as
some
other
fathers
i
know
of
but
they
must
turn
over
a
new
leaf
must
what
with
mortgages
and
arrears
i
as
short
o
cash
as
a
roadside
pauper
and
that
fool
kimble
says
the
newspaper
talking
about
peace
why
the
country
would
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
prices
run
down
like
a
jack
and
i
should
never
get
my
arrears
not
if
i
sold
all
the
fellows
up
and
there
that
damned
fowler
i
wo
put
up
with
him
any
longer
i
told
winthrop
to
go
to
cox
this
very
day
the
lying
scoundrel
told
me
he
be
sure
to
pay
me
a
hundred
last
month
he
takes
advantage
because
he
on
that
outlying
farm
and
thinks
i
shall
forget
him
the
squire
had
delivered
this
speech
in
a
coughing
and
interrupted
manner
but
with
no
pause
long
enough
for
godfrey
to
make
it
a
pretext
for
taking
up
the
word
again
he
felt
that
his
father
meant
to
ward
off
any
request
for
money
on
the
ground
of
the
misfortune
with
wildfire
and
that
the
emphasis
he
had
thus
been
led
to
lay
on
his
shortness
of
cash
and
his
arrears
was
likely
to
produce
an
attitude
of
mind
the
utmost
unfavourable
for
his
own
disclosure
but
he
must
go
on
now
he
had
begun
it
worse
than
breaking
the
horse
knees
he
been
staked
and
killed
he
said
as
soon
as
his
father
was
silent
and
had
begun
to
cut
his
meat
but
i
was
thinking
of
asking
you
to
buy
me
another
horse
i
was
only
thinking
i
lost
the
means
of
paying
you
with
the
price
of
wildfire
as
i
meant
to
do
dunsey
took
him
to
the
hunt
to
sell
him
for
me
the
other
day
and
after
he
made
a
bargain
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
with
bryce
he
went
after
the
hounds
and
took
some
fool
leap
or
other
that
did
for
the
horse
at
once
if
it
had
been
for
that
i
should
have
paid
you
a
hundred
pounds
this
morning
the
squire
had
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
was
staring
at
his
son
in
amazement
not
being
sufficiently
quick
of
brain
to
form
a
probable
guess
as
to
what
could
have
caused
so
strange
an
inversion
of
the
paternal
and
filial
relations
as
this
proposition
of
his
son
to
pay
him
a
hundred
pounds
the
truth
is
sir
i
very
sorry
i
was
quite
to
blame
said
godfrey
fowler
did
pay
that
hundred
pounds
he
paid
it
to
me
when
i
was
over
there
one
day
last
month
and
dunsey
bothered
me
for
the
money
and
i
let
him
have
it
because
i
hoped
i
should
be
able
to
pay
it
you
before
this
the
squire
was
purple
with
anger
before
his
son
had
done
speaking
and
found
utterance
difficult
you
let
dunsey
have
it
sir
and
how
long
have
you
been
so
thick
with
dunsey
that
you
must
with
him
to
embezzle
my
money
are
you
turning
out
a
scamp
i
tell
you
i
have
it
i
turn
the
whole
pack
of
you
out
of
the
house
together
and
marry
again
i
have
you
to
remember
sir
my
property
got
no
entail
on
it
since
my
grandfather
time
the
casses
can
do
as
they
like
with
their
land
remember
that
sir
let
dunsey
have
the
money
why
should
you
let
dunsey
have
the
money
there
some
lie
at
the
bottom
of
it
there
no
lie
sir
said
godfrey
i
would
have
spent
the
money
myself
but
dunsey
bothered
me
and
i
was
a
fool
and
let
him
have
it
but
i
meant
to
pay
it
whether
he
did
or
not
that
the
whole
story
i
never
meant
to
embezzle
money
and
i
not
the
man
to
do
it
you
never
knew
me
do
a
dishonest
trick
sir
where
dunsey
then
what
do
you
stand
talking
there
for
go
and
fetch
dunsey
as
i
tell
you
and
let
him
give
account
of
what
he
wanted
the
money
for
and
what
he
done
with
it
he
shall
repent
it
turn
him
out
i
said
i
would
and
i
do
it
he
sha
brave
me
go
and
fetch
him
dunsey
is
come
back
sir
what
did
he
break
his
own
neck
then
said
the
squire
with
some
disgust
at
the
idea
that
in
that
case
he
could
not
fulfil
his
threat
no
he
was
hurt
i
believe
for
the
horse
was
found
dead
and
dunsey
must
have
walked
off
i
daresay
we
shall
see
him
again
i
do
know
where
he
is
and
what
must
you
be
letting
him
have
my
money
for
answer
me
that
said
the
squire
attacking
godfrey
again
since
dunsey
was
not
within
reach
well
sir
i
do
know
said
godfrey
hesitatingly
that
was
a
feeble
evasion
but
godfrey
was
not
fond
of
lying
and
not
being
sufficiently
aware
that
no
sort
of
duplicity
can
long
flourish
without
the
help
of
vocal
falsehoods
he
was
quite
unprepared
with
invented
motives
you
do
know
i
tell
you
what
it
is
sir
you
been
up
to
some
trick
and
you
been
bribing
him
not
to
tell
said
the
squire
with
a
sudden
acuteness
which
startled
godfrey
who
felt
his
heart
beat
violently
at
the
nearness
of
his
father
guess
the
sudden
alarm
pushed
him
on
to
take
the
next
step
a
very
slight
impulse
suffices
for
that
on
a
downward
road
why
sir
he
said
trying
to
speak
with
careless
ease
it
was
a
little
affair
between
me
and
dunsey
it
no
matter
to
anybody
else
it
hardly
worth
while
to
pry
into
young
men
fooleries
it
have
made
any
difference
to
you
sir
if
i
not
had
the
bad
luck
to
lose
wildfire
i
should
have
paid
you
the
money
fooleries
pshaw
it
time
you
done
with
fooleries
and
i
have
you
know
sir
you
ha
done
with
said
the
squire
frowning
and
casting
an
angry
glance
at
his
son
your
are
not
what
i
shall
find
money
for
any
longer
there
my
grandfather
had
his
stables
full
o
horses
and
kept
a
good
house
too
and
in
worse
times
by
what
i
can
make
out
and
so
might
i
if
i
had
four
fellows
to
hang
on
me
like
i
been
too
good
a
father
to
you
all
that
what
it
is
but
i
shall
pull
up
sir
godfrey
was
silent
he
was
not
likely
to
be
very
penetrating
in
his
judgments
but
he
had
always
had
a
sense
that
his
father
indulgence
had
not
been
kindness
and
had
had
a
vague
longing
for
some
discipline
that
would
have
checked
his
own
errant
weakness
and
helped
his
better
will
the
squire
ate
his
bread
and
meat
hastily
took
a
deep
draught
of
ale
then
turned
his
chair
from
the
table
and
began
to
speak
again
it
be
all
the
worse
for
you
you
know
you
need
try
and
help
me
keep
things
together
well
sir
i
often
offered
to
take
the
management
of
things
but
you
know
you
taken
it
ill
always
and
seemed
to
think
i
wanted
to
push
you
out
of
your
place
i
know
nothing
o
your
offering
or
o
my
taking
it
ill
said
the
squire
whose
memory
consisted
in
certain
strong
impressions
unmodified
by
detail
but
i
know
one
while
you
seemed
to
be
thinking
marrying
and
i
did
offer
to
put
any
obstacles
in
your
way
as
some
fathers
would
i
as
lieve
you
married
lammeter
daughter
as
anybody
i
suppose
if
i
said
you
nay
you
ha
kept
on
with
it
but
for
want
o
contradiction
you
changed
your
mind
you
a
fellow
you
take
after
your
poor
mother
she
never
had
a
will
of
her
own
a
woman
has
no
call
for
one
if
she
got
a
proper
man
for
her
husband
but
wife
had
need
have
one
for
you
hardly
know
your
own
mind
enough
to
make
both
your
legs
walk
one
way
the
lass
has
said
downright
she
wo
have
you
has
she
no
said
godfrey
feeling
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
but
i
think
she
will
think
why
have
you
the
courage
to
ask
her
do
you
stick
to
it
you
want
to
have
that
the
thing
there
no
other
woman
i
want
to
marry
said
godfrey
evasively
well
then
let
me
make
the
offer
for
you
that
all
if
you
the
pluck
to
do
it
yourself
lammeter
is
likely
to
be
loath
for
his
daughter
to
marry
into
family
i
should
think
and
as
for
the
pretty
lass
she
would
have
her
cousin
and
there
nobody
else
as
i
see
could
ha
stood
in
your
way
i
rather
let
it
be
please
sir
at
present
said
godfrey
in
alarm
i
think
she
a
little
offended
with
me
just
now
and
i
should
like
to
speak
for
myself
a
man
must
manage
these
things
for
himself
well
speak
then
and
manage
it
and
see
if
you
ca
turn
over
a
new
leaf
that
what
a
man
must
do
when
he
thinks
o
marrying
i
do
see
how
i
can
think
of
it
at
present
sir
you
would
like
to
settle
me
on
one
of
the
farms
i
suppose
and
i
do
think
come
to
live
in
this
house
with
all
my
brothers
it
a
different
sort
of
life
to
what
she
been
used
to
not
come
to
live
in
this
house
do
tell
me
you
ask
her
all
said
the
squire
with
a
short
scornful
laugh
i
rather
let
the
thing
be
at
present
sir
said
godfrey
i
hope
you
wo
try
to
hurry
it
on
by
saying
anything
i
shall
do
what
i
choose
said
the
squire
and
i
shall
let
you
know
i
master
else
you
may
turn
out
and
find
an
estate
to
drop
into
somewhere
else
go
out
and
tell
winthrop
not
to
go
to
cox
but
wait
for
me
and
tell
to
get
my
horse
saddled
and
stop
look
out
and
get
that
hack
o
dunsey
sold
and
hand
me
the
money
will
you
keep
no
more
hacks
at
my
expense
and
if
you
know
where
sneaking
i
daresay
you
do
you
may
tell
him
to
spare
himself
the
journey
o
coming
back
home
let
him
turn
ostler
and
keep
himself
he
sha
hang
on
me
any
more
i
do
know
where
he
is
sir
and
if
i
did
it
is
my
place
to
tell
him
to
keep
away
said
godfrey
moving
towards
the
door
confound
it
sir
do
stay
arguing
but
go
and
order
my
horse
said
the
squire
taking
up
a
pipe
godfrey
left
the
room
hardly
knowing
whether
he
were
more
relieved
by
the
sense
that
the
interview
was
ended
without
having
made
any
change
in
his
position
or
more
uneasy
that
he
had
entangled
himself
still
further
in
prevarication
and
deceit
what
had
passed
about
his
proposing
to
nancy
had
raised
a
new
alarm
lest
by
some
words
of
his
father
to
lammeter
he
should
be
thrown
into
the
embarrassment
of
being
obliged
absolutely
to
decline
her
when
she
seemed
to
be
within
his
reach
he
fled
to
his
usual
refuge
that
of
hoping
for
some
unforeseen
turn
of
fortune
some
favourable
chance
which
would
save
him
from
unpleasant
consequences
perhaps
even
justify
his
insincerity
by
manifesting
its
prudence
and
in
this
point
of
trusting
to
some
throw
of
fortune
dice
godfrey
can
hardly
be
called
specially
favourable
chance
i
fancy
is
the
god
of
all
men
who
follow
their
own
devices
instead
of
obeying
a
law
they
believe
in
let
even
a
polished
man
of
these
days
get
into
a
position
he
is
ashamed
to
avow
and
his
mind
will
be
bent
on
all
the
possible
issues
that
may
deliver
him
from
the
calculable
results
of
that
position
let
him
live
outside
his
income
or
shirk
the
resolute
honest
work
that
brings
wages
and
he
will
presently
find
himself
dreaming
of
a
possible
benefactor
a
possible
simpleton
who
may
be
cajoled
into
using
his
interest
a
possible
state
of
mind
in
some
possible
person
not
yet
forthcoming
let
him
neglect
the
responsibilities
of
his
office
and
he
will
inevitably
anchor
himself
on
the
chance
that
the
thing
left
undone
may
turn
out
not
to
be
of
the
supposed
importance
let
him
betray
his
friend
confidence
and
he
will
adore
that
same
cunning
complexity
called
chance
which
gives
him
the
hope
that
his
friend
will
never
know
let
him
forsake
a
decent
craft
that
he
may
pursue
the
gentilities
of
a
profession
to
which
nature
never
called
him
and
his
religion
will
infallibly
be
the
worship
of
blessed
chance
which
he
will
believe
in
as
the
mighty
creator
of
success
the
evil
principle
deprecated
in
that
religion
is
the
orderly
sequence
by
which
the
seed
brings
forth
a
crop
after
its
kind
chapter
x
justice
malam
was
naturally
regarded
in
tarley
and
raveloe
as
a
man
of
capacious
mind
seeing
that
he
could
draw
much
wider
conclusions
without
evidence
than
could
be
expected
of
his
neighbours
who
were
not
on
the
commission
of
the
peace
such
a
man
was
not
likely
to
neglect
the
clue
of
the
and
an
inquiry
was
set
on
foot
concerning
a
pedlar
name
unknown
with
curly
black
hair
and
a
foreign
complexion
carrying
a
box
of
cutlery
and
jewellery
and
wearing
large
rings
in
his
ears
but
either
because
inquiry
was
too
to
overtake
him
or
because
the
description
applied
to
so
many
pedlars
that
inquiry
did
not
know
how
to
choose
among
them
weeks
passed
away
and
there
was
no
other
result
concerning
the
robbery
than
a
gradual
cessation
of
the
excitement
it
had
caused
in
raveloe
dunstan
cass
absence
was
hardly
a
subject
of
remark
he
had
once
before
had
a
quarrel
with
his
father
and
had
gone
off
nobody
knew
whither
to
return
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
take
up
his
old
quarters
unforbidden
and
swagger
as
usual
his
own
family
who
equally
expected
this
issue
with
the
sole
difference
that
the
squire
was
determined
this
time
to
forbid
him
the
old
quarters
never
mentioned
his
absence
and
when
his
uncle
kimble
or
osgood
noticed
it
the
story
of
his
having
killed
wildfire
and
committed
some
offence
against
his
father
was
enough
to
prevent
surprise
to
connect
the
fact
of
dunsey
disappearance
with
that
of
the
robbery
occurring
on
the
same
day
lay
quite
away
from
the
track
of
every
one
thought
even
godfrey
who
had
better
reason
than
any
one
else
to
know
what
his
brother
was
capable
of
he
remembered
no
mention
of
the
weaver
between
them
since
the
time
twelve
years
ago
when
it
was
their
boyish
sport
to
deride
him
and
besides
his
imagination
constantly
created
an
for
dunstan
he
saw
him
continually
in
some
congenial
haunt
to
which
he
had
walked
off
on
leaving
wildfire
saw
him
sponging
on
chance
acquaintances
and
meditating
a
return
home
to
the
old
amusement
of
tormenting
his
elder
brother
even
if
any
brain
in
raveloe
had
put
the
said
two
facts
together
i
doubt
whether
a
combination
so
injurious
to
the
prescriptive
respectability
of
a
family
with
a
mural
monument
and
venerable
tankards
would
not
have
been
suppressed
as
of
unsound
tendency
but
christmas
puddings
brawn
and
abundance
of
spirituous
liquors
throwing
the
mental
originality
into
the
channel
of
nightmare
are
great
preservatives
against
a
dangerous
spontaneity
of
waking
thought
when
the
robbery
was
talked
of
at
the
rainbow
and
elsewhere
in
good
company
the
balance
continued
to
waver
between
the
rational
explanation
founded
on
the
and
the
theory
of
an
impenetrable
mystery
that
mocked
investigation
the
advocates
of
the
view
considered
the
other
side
a
and
credulous
set
who
because
they
themselves
were
supposed
everybody
else
to
have
the
same
blank
outlook
and
the
adherents
of
the
inexplicable
more
than
hinted
that
their
antagonists
were
animals
inclined
to
crow
before
they
had
found
any
corn
mere
in
point
of
depth
whose
consisted
in
supposing
there
was
nothing
behind
a
because
they
see
through
it
so
that
though
their
controversy
did
not
serve
to
elicit
the
fact
concerning
the
robbery
it
elicited
some
true
opinions
of
collateral
importance
but
while
poor
silas
loss
served
thus
to
brush
the
slow
current
of
raveloe
conversation
silas
himself
was
feeling
the
withering
desolation
of
that
bereavement
about
which
his
neighbours
were
arguing
at
their
ease
to
any
one
who
had
observed
him
before
he
lost
his
gold
it
might
have
seemed
that
so
withered
and
shrunken
a
life
as
his
could
hardly
be
susceptible
of
a
bruise
could
hardly
endure
any
subtraction
but
such
as
would
put
an
end
to
it
altogether
but
in
reality
it
had
been
an
eager
life
filled
with
immediate
purpose
which
fenced
him
in
from
the
wide
cheerless
unknown
it
had
been
a
clinging
life
and
though
the
object
round
which
its
fibres
had
clung
was
a
dead
disrupted
thing
it
satisfied
the
need
for
clinging
but
now
the
fence
was
broken
down
the
support
was
snatched
away
marner
thoughts
could
no
longer
move
in
their
old
round
and
were
baffled
by
a
blank
like
that
which
meets
a
plodding
ant
when
the
earth
has
broken
away
on
its
homeward
path
the
loom
was
there
and
the
weaving
and
the
growing
pattern
in
the
cloth
but
the
bright
treasure
in
the
hole
under
his
feet
was
gone
the
prospect
of
handling
and
counting
it
was
gone
the
evening
had
no
phantasm
of
delight
to
still
the
poor
craving
the
thought
of
the
money
he
would
get
by
his
actual
work
could
bring
no
joy
for
its
meagre
image
was
only
a
fresh
reminder
of
his
loss
and
hope
was
too
heavily
crushed
by
the
sudden
blow
for
his
imagination
to
dwell
on
the
growth
of
a
new
hoard
from
that
small
beginning
he
filled
up
the
blank
with
grief
as
he
sat
weaving
he
every
now
and
then
moaned
low
like
one
in
pain
it
was
the
sign
that
his
thoughts
had
come
round
again
to
the
sudden
chasm
to
the
empty
and
all
the
evening
as
he
sat
in
his
loneliness
by
his
dull
fire
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
clasped
his
head
with
his
hands
and
moaned
very
low
not
as
one
who
seeks
to
be
heard
and
yet
he
was
not
utterly
forsaken
in
his
trouble
the
repulsion
marner
had
always
created
in
his
neighbours
was
partly
dissipated
by
the
new
light
in
which
this
misfortune
had
shown
him
instead
of
a
man
who
had
more
cunning
than
honest
folks
could
come
by
and
what
was
worse
had
not
the
inclination
to
use
that
cunning
in
a
neighbourly
way
it
was
now
apparent
that
silas
had
not
cunning
enough
to
keep
his
own
he
was
generally
spoken
of
as
a
poor
mushed
creatur
and
that
avoidance
of
his
neighbours
which
had
before
been
referred
to
his
and
to
a
probable
addiction
to
worse
company
was
now
considered
mere
craziness
this
change
to
a
kindlier
feeling
was
shown
in
various
ways
the
odour
of
christmas
cooking
being
on
the
wind
it
was
the
season
when
superfluous
pork
and
black
puddings
are
suggestive
of
charity
in
families
and
silas
misfortune
had
brought
him
uppermost
in
the
memory
of
housekeepers
like
osgood
crackenthorp
too
while
he
admonished
silas
that
his
money
had
probably
been
taken
from
him
because
he
thought
too
much
of
it
and
never
came
to
church
enforced
the
doctrine
by
a
present
of
pigs
pettitoes
well
calculated
to
dissipate
unfounded
prejudices
against
the
clerical
character
neighbours
who
had
nothing
but
verbal
consolation
to
give
showed
a
disposition
not
only
to
greet
silas
and
discuss
his
misfortune
at
some
length
when
they
encountered
him
in
the
village
but
also
to
take
the
trouble
of
calling
at
his
cottage
and
getting
him
to
repeat
all
the
details
on
the
very
spot
and
then
they
would
try
to
cheer
him
by
saying
well
master
marner
you
no
worse
off
nor
other
poor
folks
after
all
and
if
you
was
to
be
crippled
the
parish
give
you
a
i
suppose
one
reason
why
we
are
seldom
able
to
comfort
our
neighbours
with
our
words
is
that
our
goodwill
gets
adulterated
in
spite
of
ourselves
before
it
can
pass
our
lips
we
can
send
black
puddings
and
pettitoes
without
giving
them
a
flavour
of
our
own
egoism
but
language
is
a
stream
that
is
almost
sure
to
smack
of
a
mingled
soil
there
was
a
fair
proportion
of
kindness
in
raveloe
but
it
was
often
of
a
beery
and
bungling
sort
and
took
the
shape
least
allied
to
the
complimentary
and
hypocritical
macey
for
example
coming
one
evening
expressly
to
let
silas
know
that
recent
events
had
given
him
the
advantage
of
standing
more
favourably
in
the
opinion
of
a
man
whose
judgment
was
not
formed
lightly
opened
the
conversation
by
saying
as
soon
as
he
had
seated
himself
and
adjusted
his
thumbs
come
master
marner
why
you
no
call
to
sit
you
a
deal
better
off
to
ha
lost
your
money
nor
to
ha
kep
it
by
foul
means
i
used
to
think
when
you
first
come
into
these
parts
as
you
were
no
better
nor
you
should
be
you
were
younger
a
deal
than
what
you
are
now
but
you
were
allays
a
staring
creatur
partly
like
a
calf
as
i
may
say
but
there
no
knowing
it
every
thing
as
old
harry
had
the
making
of
i
mean
speaking
o
toads
and
such
for
they
often
harmless
like
and
useful
against
varmin
and
it
pretty
much
the
same
wi
you
as
fur
as
i
can
see
though
as
to
the
yarbs
and
stuff
to
cure
the
breathing
if
you
brought
that
sort
o
knowledge
from
distant
parts
you
might
been
a
bit
freer
of
it
and
if
the
knowledge
was
well
come
by
why
you
might
ha
made
up
for
it
by
coming
to
church
for
as
for
the
children
as
the
wise
woman
charmed
i
been
at
the
christening
of
again
and
again
and
they
took
the
water
just
as
well
and
reasonable
for
if
old
harry
a
mind
to
do
a
bit
o
kindness
for
a
holiday
like
who
got
anything
against
it
that
my
thinking
and
i
been
clerk
o
this
parish
forty
year
and
i
know
when
the
parson
and
me
does
the
cussing
of
a
ash
wednesday
there
no
cussing
o
folks
as
have
a
mind
to
be
cured
without
a
doctor
let
kimble
say
what
he
will
and
so
master
marner
as
i
was
saying
for
there
windings
things
as
they
may
carry
you
to
the
fur
end
o
the
afore
you
get
back
to
my
advice
is
as
you
keep
up
your
sperrits
for
as
for
thinking
you
a
deep
un
and
ha
got
more
inside
you
nor
bear
daylight
i
not
o
that
opinion
at
all
and
so
i
tell
the
neighbours
for
says
i
you
talk
o
master
marner
making
out
a
tale
why
it
nonsense
that
is
it
take
a
man
to
make
a
tale
like
that
and
says
i
he
looked
as
scared
as
a
rabbit
during
this
discursive
address
silas
had
continued
motionless
in
his
previous
attitude
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
pressing
his
hands
against
his
head
macey
not
doubting
that
he
had
been
listened
to
paused
in
the
expectation
of
some
appreciatory
reply
but
marner
remained
silent
he
had
a
sense
that
the
old
man
meant
to
be
and
neighbourly
but
the
kindness
fell
on
him
as
sunshine
falls
on
the
wretched
he
had
no
heart
to
taste
it
and
felt
that
it
was
very
far
off
him
come
master
marner
have
you
got
nothing
to
say
to
that
said
macey
at
last
with
a
slight
accent
of
impatience
oh
said
marner
slowly
shaking
his
head
between
his
hands
i
thank
you
thank
you
kindly
aye
aye
to
be
sure
i
thought
you
would
said
macey
and
my
advice
is
have
you
got
a
sunday
suit
no
said
marner
i
doubted
it
was
so
said
macey
now
let
me
advise
you
to
get
a
sunday
suit
there
tookey
he
a
poor
creatur
but
he
got
my
tailoring
business
and
some
o
my
money
in
it
and
he
shall
make
a
suit
at
a
low
price
and
give
you
trust
and
then
you
can
come
to
church
and
be
a
bit
neighbourly
why
you
never
heared
me
say
amen
since
you
come
into
these
parts
and
i
recommend
you
to
lose
no
time
for
it
be
poor
work
when
tookey
has
it
all
to
himself
for
i
may
be
equil
to
stand
i
the
desk
at
all
come
another
winter
here
macey
paused
perhaps
expecting
some
sign
of
emotion
in
his
hearer
but
not
observing
any
he
went
on
and
as
for
the
money
for
the
suit
o
clothes
why
you
get
a
matter
of
a
pound
at
your
weaving
master
marner
and
you
a
young
man
eh
for
all
you
look
so
mushed
why
you
could
ha
been
when
you
come
into
these
parts
eh
silas
started
a
little
at
the
change
to
a
questioning
tone
and
answered
mildly
i
do
know
i
ca
rightly
say
it
a
long
while
since
after
receiving
such
an
answer
as
this
it
is
not
surprising
that
macey
observed
later
on
in
the
evening
at
the
rainbow
that
head
was
all
of
a
muddle
and
that
it
was
to
be
doubted
if
he
ever
knew
when
sunday
came
round
which
showed
him
a
worse
heathen
than
many
a
dog
another
of
silas
comforters
besides
macey
came
to
him
with
a
mind
highly
charged
on
the
same
topic
this
was
winthrop
the
wheelwright
wife
the
inhabitants
of
raveloe
were
not
severely
regular
in
their
and
perhaps
there
was
hardly
a
person
in
the
parish
who
would
not
have
held
that
to
go
to
church
every
sunday
in
the
calendar
would
have
shown
a
greedy
desire
to
stand
well
with
heaven
and
get
an
undue
advantage
over
their
neighbours
a
wish
to
be
better
than
the
common
run
that
would
have
implied
a
reflection
on
those
who
had
had
godfathers
and
godmothers
as
well
as
themselves
and
had
an
equal
right
to
the
at
the
same
time
it
was
understood
to
be
requisite
for
all
who
were
not
household
servants
or
young
men
to
take
the
sacrament
at
one
of
the
great
festivals
squire
cass
himself
took
it
on
while
those
who
were
held
to
be
good
livers
went
to
church
with
greater
though
still
with
moderate
frequency
winthrop
was
one
of
these
she
was
in
all
respects
a
woman
of
scrupulous
conscience
so
eager
for
duties
that
life
seemed
to
offer
them
too
scantily
unless
she
rose
at
four
though
this
threw
a
scarcity
of
work
over
the
more
advanced
hours
of
the
morning
which
it
was
a
constant
problem
with
her
to
remove
yet
she
had
not
the
vixenish
temper
which
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
a
necessary
condition
of
such
habits
she
was
a
very
mild
patient
woman
whose
nature
it
was
to
seek
out
all
the
sadder
and
more
serious
elements
of
life
and
pasture
her
mind
upon
them
she
was
the
person
always
first
thought
of
in
raveloe
when
there
was
illness
or
death
in
a
family
when
leeches
were
to
be
applied
or
there
was
a
sudden
disappointment
in
a
monthly
nurse
she
was
a
comfortable
woman
having
her
lips
always
slightly
screwed
as
if
she
felt
herself
in
a
with
the
doctor
or
the
clergyman
present
but
she
was
never
whimpering
no
one
had
seen
her
shed
tears
she
was
simply
grave
and
inclined
to
shake
her
head
and
sigh
almost
imperceptibly
like
a
funereal
mourner
who
is
not
a
relation
it
seemed
surprising
that
ben
winthrop
who
loved
his
and
his
joke
got
along
so
well
with
dolly
but
she
took
her
husband
jokes
and
joviality
as
patiently
as
everything
else
considering
that
men
be
so
and
viewing
the
stronger
sex
in
the
light
of
animals
whom
it
had
pleased
heaven
to
make
naturally
troublesome
like
bulls
and
this
good
wholesome
woman
could
hardly
fail
to
have
her
mind
drawn
strongly
towards
silas
marner
now
that
he
appeared
in
the
light
of
a
sufferer
and
one
sunday
afternoon
she
took
her
little
boy
aaron
with
her
and
went
to
call
on
silas
carrying
in
her
hand
some
small
flat
articles
much
esteemed
in
raveloe
aaron
an
youngster
of
seven
with
a
clean
starched
frill
which
looked
like
a
plate
for
the
apples
needed
all
his
adventurous
curiosity
to
embolden
him
against
the
possibility
that
the
weaver
might
do
him
some
bodily
injury
and
his
dubiety
was
much
increased
when
on
arriving
at
the
they
heard
the
mysterious
sound
of
the
loom
ah
it
is
as
i
thought
said
winthrop
sadly
they
had
to
knock
loudly
before
silas
heard
them
but
when
he
did
come
to
the
door
he
showed
no
impatience
as
he
would
once
have
done
at
a
visit
that
had
been
unasked
for
and
unexpected
formerly
his
heart
had
been
as
a
locked
casket
with
its
treasure
inside
but
now
the
casket
was
empty
and
the
lock
was
broken
left
groping
in
darkness
with
his
prop
utterly
gone
silas
had
inevitably
a
sense
though
a
dull
and
one
that
if
any
help
came
to
him
it
must
come
from
without
and
there
was
a
slight
stirring
of
expectation
at
the
sight
of
his
a
faint
consciousness
of
dependence
on
their
goodwill
he
opened
the
door
wide
to
admit
dolly
but
without
otherwise
returning
her
greeting
than
by
moving
the
armchair
a
few
inches
as
a
sign
that
she
was
to
sit
down
in
it
dolly
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
removed
the
white
cloth
that
covered
her
and
said
in
her
gravest
way
i
a
baking
yisterday
master
marner
and
the
turned
out
better
nor
common
and
i
ha
asked
you
to
accept
some
if
thought
well
i
do
eat
such
things
myself
for
a
bit
o
what
i
like
from
one
year
end
to
the
other
but
men
stomichs
are
made
so
comical
they
want
a
change
they
do
i
know
god
help
dolly
sighed
gently
as
she
held
out
the
cakes
to
silas
who
thanked
her
kindly
and
looked
very
close
at
them
absently
being
accustomed
to
look
so
at
everything
he
took
into
his
hand
eyed
all
the
while
by
the
wondering
bright
orbs
of
the
small
aaron
who
had
made
an
outwork
of
his
mother
chair
and
was
peeping
round
from
behind
it
there
letters
pricked
on
said
dolly
i
ca
read
myself
and
there
nobody
not
macey
himself
rightly
knows
what
they
mean
but
they
a
good
meaning
for
they
the
same
as
is
on
the
at
church
what
are
they
aaron
my
dear
aaron
retreated
completely
behind
his
outwork
oh
go
that
naughty
said
his
mother
mildly
well
whativer
the
letters
are
they
a
good
meaning
and
it
a
stamp
as
has
been
in
our
house
ben
says
ever
since
he
was
a
little
un
and
his
mother
used
to
put
it
on
the
cakes
and
i
allays
put
it
on
too
for
if
any
good
we
need
of
it
i
this
world
it
said
silas
at
which
proof
of
learning
aaron
peeped
round
the
chair
again
well
to
be
sure
you
can
read
off
said
dolly
ben
read
to
me
many
and
many
a
time
but
they
slip
out
o
my
mind
again
the
more
the
pity
for
they
good
letters
else
they
would
be
in
the
church
and
so
i
prick
on
all
the
loaves
and
all
the
cakes
though
sometimes
they
wo
hold
because
o
the
rising
for
as
i
said
if
there
any
good
to
be
got
we
need
of
it
i
this
world
that
we
have
and
i
hope
they
bring
good
to
you
master
marner
for
it
that
will
i
brought
you
the
cakes
and
you
see
the
letters
have
held
better
nor
common
silas
was
as
unable
to
interpret
the
letters
as
dolly
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
misunderstanding
the
desire
to
give
comfort
that
made
itself
heard
in
her
quiet
tones
he
said
with
more
feeling
than
before
thank
you
thank
you
kindly
but
he
laid
down
the
cakes
and
seated
himself
absently
drearily
unconscious
of
any
distinct
benefit
towards
which
the
cakes
and
the
letters
or
even
dolly
kindness
could
tend
for
him
ah
if
there
good
anywhere
we
need
of
it
repeated
dolly
who
did
not
lightly
forsake
a
serviceable
phrase
she
looked
at
silas
pityingly
as
she
went
on
but
you
did
hear
the
this
morning
master
marner
i
doubt
you
did
know
it
was
sunday
living
so
lone
here
you
lose
your
count
i
daresay
and
then
when
your
loom
makes
a
noise
you
ca
hear
the
bells
more
now
the
frost
kills
the
sound
yes
i
did
i
heard
said
silas
to
whom
sunday
bells
were
a
mere
accident
of
the
day
and
not
part
of
its
sacredness
there
had
been
no
bells
in
lantern
yard
dear
heart
said
dolly
pausing
before
she
spoke
again
but
what
a
pity
it
is
you
should
work
of
a
sunday
and
not
clean
yourself
if
you
go
to
church
for
if
you
a
roasting
bit
it
might
be
as
you
could
leave
it
being
a
lone
man
but
there
the
bakehus
if
you
could
make
up
your
mind
to
spend
a
twopence
on
the
oven
now
and
then
not
every
week
in
course
i
should
like
to
do
that
myself
you
might
carry
your
bit
o
dinner
there
for
it
nothing
but
right
to
have
a
bit
o
summat
hot
of
a
sunday
and
not
to
make
it
as
you
ca
know
your
dinner
from
saturday
but
now
upo
this
blessed
christmas
as
is
ever
coming
if
you
was
to
take
your
dinner
to
the
bakehus
and
go
to
church
and
see
the
holly
and
the
yew
and
hear
the
anthim
and
then
take
the
sacramen
you
be
a
deal
the
better
and
you
know
which
end
you
stood
on
and
you
could
put
your
trust
i
them
as
knows
better
nor
we
do
seein
you
ha
done
what
it
lies
on
us
all
to
do
dolly
exhortation
which
was
an
unusually
long
effort
of
speech
for
her
was
uttered
in
the
soothing
persuasive
tone
with
which
she
would
have
tried
to
prevail
on
a
sick
man
to
take
his
medicine
or
a
basin
of
gruel
for
which
he
had
no
appetite
silas
had
never
before
been
closely
urged
on
the
point
of
his
absence
from
church
which
had
only
been
thought
of
as
a
part
of
his
general
queerness
and
he
was
too
direct
and
simple
to
evade
dolly
appeal
nay
nay
he
said
i
know
nothing
o
church
i
never
been
to
church
no
said
dolly
in
a
low
tone
of
wonderment
then
bethinking
herself
of
silas
advent
from
an
unknown
country
she
said
could
it
ha
been
as
they
no
church
where
you
was
born
oh
yes
said
silas
meditatively
sitting
in
his
usual
posture
of
leaning
on
his
knees
and
supporting
his
head
there
was
churches
a
many
it
was
a
big
town
but
i
knew
nothing
of
i
went
to
chapel
dolly
was
much
puzzled
at
this
new
word
but
she
was
rather
afraid
of
inquiring
further
lest
chapel
might
mean
some
haunt
of
wickedness
after
a
little
thought
she
said
well
master
marner
it
niver
too
late
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
if
you
niver
had
no
church
there
no
telling
the
good
it
do
you
for
i
feel
so
set
up
and
comfortable
as
niver
was
when
i
been
and
heard
the
prayers
and
the
singing
to
the
praise
and
glory
o
god
as
macey
gives
out
and
crackenthorp
saying
good
words
and
more
on
sacramen
day
and
if
a
bit
o
trouble
comes
i
feel
as
i
can
put
up
wi
it
for
i
looked
for
help
i
the
right
quarter
and
gev
myself
up
to
them
as
we
must
all
give
ourselves
up
to
at
the
last
and
if
done
our
part
it
is
to
be
believed
as
them
as
are
above
us
be
worse
nor
we
are
and
come
short
o
poor
dolly
exposition
of
her
simple
raveloe
theology
fell
rather
unmeaningly
on
silas
ears
for
there
was
no
word
in
it
that
could
rouse
a
memory
of
what
he
had
known
as
religion
and
his
comprehension
was
quite
baffled
by
the
plural
pronoun
which
was
no
heresy
of
dolly
but
only
her
way
of
avoiding
a
presumptuous
familiarity
he
remained
silent
not
feeling
inclined
to
assent
to
the
part
of
speech
which
he
fully
understood
her
recommendation
that
he
should
go
to
church
indeed
silas
was
so
unaccustomed
to
talk
beyond
the
brief
questions
and
answers
necessary
for
the
transaction
of
his
simple
business
that
words
did
not
easily
come
to
him
without
the
urgency
of
a
distinct
purpose
but
now
little
aaron
having
become
used
to
the
weaver
awful
presence
had
advanced
to
his
mother
side
and
silas
seeming
to
notice
him
for
the
first
time
tried
to
return
dolly
signs
of
by
offering
the
lad
a
bit
of
aaron
shrank
back
a
little
and
rubbed
his
head
against
his
mother
shoulder
but
still
thought
the
piece
of
cake
worth
the
risk
of
putting
his
hand
out
for
it
oh
for
shame
aaron
said
his
mother
taking
him
on
her
lap
however
why
you
do
want
cake
again
yet
awhile
he
wonderful
hearty
she
went
on
with
a
little
sigh
that
he
is
god
knows
my
youngest
and
we
spoil
him
sadly
for
either
me
or
the
father
must
allays
hev
him
in
our
sight
that
we
must
she
stroked
aaron
brown
head
and
thought
it
must
do
master
marner
good
to
see
such
a
pictur
of
a
child
but
marner
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
saw
the
rosy
face
as
a
mere
dim
round
with
two
dark
spots
in
it
and
he
got
a
voice
like
a
bird
you
would
think
dolly
went
on
he
can
sing
a
christmas
carril
as
his
father
taught
him
and
i
take
it
for
a
token
as
he
come
to
good
as
he
can
learn
the
good
tunes
so
quick
come
aaron
stan
up
and
sing
the
carril
to
master
marner
come
aaron
replied
by
rubbing
his
forehead
against
his
mother
shoulder
oh
that
naughty
said
dolly
gently
stan
up
when
mother
tells
you
and
let
me
hold
the
cake
till
you
done
aaron
was
not
indisposed
to
display
his
talents
even
to
an
ogre
under
protecting
circumstances
and
after
a
few
more
signs
of
coyness
consisting
chiefly
in
rubbing
the
backs
of
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
then
peeping
between
them
at
master
marner
to
see
if
he
looked
anxious
for
the
carril
he
at
length
allowed
his
head
to
be
duly
adjusted
and
standing
behind
the
table
which
let
him
appear
above
it
only
as
far
as
his
broad
frill
so
that
he
looked
like
a
cherubic
head
untroubled
with
a
body
he
began
with
a
clear
chirp
and
in
a
melody
that
had
the
rhythm
of
an
industrious
hammer
god
rest
you
merry
gentlemen
let
nothing
you
dismay
for
jesus
christ
our
savior
was
born
on
dolly
listened
with
a
devout
look
glancing
at
marner
in
some
confidence
that
this
strain
would
help
to
allure
him
to
church
that
christmas
music
she
said
when
aaron
had
ended
and
had
secured
his
piece
of
cake
again
there
no
other
music
equil
to
the
christmas
music
hark
the
erol
angils
sing
and
you
may
judge
what
it
is
at
church
master
marner
with
the
bassoon
and
the
voices
as
you
ca
help
thinking
you
got
to
a
better
place
for
i
would
speak
ill
o
this
world
seeing
as
them
put
us
in
it
as
knows
best
but
what
wi
the
drink
and
the
quarrelling
and
the
bad
illnesses
and
the
hard
dying
as
i
seen
times
and
times
thankful
to
hear
of
a
better
the
boy
sings
pretty
do
he
master
marner
yes
said
silas
absently
very
pretty
the
christmas
carol
with
its
rhythm
had
fallen
on
his
ears
as
strange
music
quite
unlike
a
hymn
and
could
have
none
of
the
effect
dolly
contemplated
but
he
wanted
to
show
her
that
he
was
grateful
and
the
only
mode
that
occurred
to
him
was
to
offer
aaron
a
bit
more
cake
oh
no
thank
you
master
marner
said
dolly
holding
down
willing
hands
we
must
be
going
home
now
and
so
i
wish
you
master
marner
and
if
you
ever
feel
anyways
bad
in
your
inside
as
you
ca
fend
for
yourself
i
come
and
clean
up
for
you
and
get
you
a
bit
o
victual
and
willing
but
i
beg
and
pray
of
you
to
leave
off
weaving
of
a
sunday
for
it
bad
for
soul
and
body
and
the
money
as
comes
i
that
way
be
a
bad
bed
to
lie
down
on
at
the
last
if
it
does
fly
away
nobody
knows
where
like
the
white
frost
and
you
excuse
me
being
that
free
with
you
master
marner
for
i
wish
you
well
i
do
make
your
bow
aaron
silas
said
and
thank
you
kindly
as
he
opened
the
door
for
dolly
but
he
could
help
feeling
relieved
when
she
was
gone
relieved
that
he
might
weave
again
and
moan
at
his
ease
her
simple
view
of
life
and
its
comforts
by
which
she
had
tried
to
cheer
him
was
only
like
a
report
of
unknown
objects
which
his
imagination
could
not
fashion
the
fountains
of
human
love
and
of
faith
in
a
divine
love
had
not
yet
been
unlocked
and
his
soul
was
still
the
shrunken
rivulet
with
only
this
difference
that
its
little
groove
of
sand
was
blocked
up
and
it
wandered
confusedly
against
dark
obstruction
and
so
notwithstanding
the
honest
persuasions
of
macey
and
dolly
winthrop
silas
spent
his
in
loneliness
eating
his
meat
in
sadness
of
heart
though
the
meat
had
come
to
him
as
a
neighbourly
present
in
the
morning
he
looked
out
on
the
black
frost
that
seemed
to
press
cruelly
on
every
blade
of
grass
while
the
red
pool
shivered
under
the
bitter
wind
but
towards
evening
the
snow
began
to
fall
and
curtained
from
him
even
that
dreary
outlook
shutting
him
close
up
with
his
narrow
grief
and
he
sat
in
his
robbed
home
through
the
livelong
evening
not
caring
to
close
his
shutters
or
lock
his
door
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
and
moaning
till
the
cold
grasped
him
and
told
him
that
his
fire
was
grey
nobody
in
this
world
but
himself
knew
that
he
was
the
same
silas
marner
who
had
once
loved
his
fellow
with
tender
love
and
trusted
in
an
unseen
goodness
even
to
himself
that
past
experience
had
become
dim
but
in
raveloe
village
the
bells
rang
merrily
and
the
church
was
fuller
than
all
through
the
rest
of
the
year
with
red
faces
among
the
abundant
boughs
faces
prepared
for
a
longer
service
than
usual
by
an
odorous
breakfast
of
toast
and
ale
those
green
boughs
the
hymn
and
anthem
never
heard
but
at
christmas
even
the
athanasian
creed
which
was
discriminated
from
the
others
only
as
being
longer
and
of
exceptional
virtue
since
it
was
only
read
on
rare
occasions
brought
a
vague
exulting
sense
for
which
the
grown
men
could
as
little
have
found
words
as
the
children
that
something
great
and
mysterious
had
been
done
for
them
in
heaven
above
and
in
earth
below
which
they
were
appropriating
by
their
presence
and
then
the
red
faces
made
their
way
through
the
black
biting
frost
to
their
own
homes
feeling
themselves
free
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
eat
drink
and
be
merry
and
using
that
christian
freedom
without
diffidence
at
squire
cass
family
party
that
day
nobody
mentioned
dunstan
nobody
was
sorry
for
his
absence
or
feared
it
would
be
too
long
the
doctor
and
his
wife
uncle
and
aunt
kimble
were
there
and
the
annual
christmas
talk
was
carried
through
without
any
omissions
rising
to
the
climax
of
kimble
experience
when
he
walked
the
london
hospitals
thirty
years
back
together
with
striking
professional
anecdotes
then
gathered
whereupon
cards
followed
with
aunt
kimble
annual
failure
to
follow
suit
and
uncle
kimble
irascibility
concerning
the
odd
trick
which
was
rarely
explicable
to
him
when
it
was
not
on
his
side
without
a
general
visitation
of
tricks
to
see
that
they
were
formed
on
sound
principles
the
whole
being
accompanied
by
a
strong
steaming
odour
of
but
the
party
on
being
a
strictly
family
party
was
not
the
brilliant
celebration
of
the
season
at
the
red
house
it
was
the
great
dance
on
new
year
eve
that
made
the
glory
of
squire
cass
hospitality
as
of
his
forefathers
time
out
of
mind
this
was
the
occasion
when
all
the
society
of
raveloe
and
tarley
whether
old
acquaintances
separated
by
long
rutty
distances
or
cooled
acquaintances
separated
by
misunderstandings
concerning
runaway
calves
or
acquaintances
founded
on
intermittent
condescension
counted
on
meeting
and
on
comporting
themselves
with
mutual
appropriateness
this
was
the
occasion
on
which
fair
dames
who
came
on
pillions
sent
their
bandboxes
before
them
supplied
with
more
than
their
evening
costume
for
the
feast
was
not
to
end
with
a
single
evening
like
a
paltry
town
entertainment
where
the
whole
supply
of
eatables
is
put
on
the
table
at
once
and
bedding
is
scanty
the
red
house
was
provisioned
as
if
for
a
siege
and
as
for
the
spare
ready
to
be
laid
on
floors
they
were
as
plentiful
as
might
naturally
be
expected
in
a
family
that
had
killed
its
own
geese
for
many
generations
godfrey
cass
was
looking
forward
to
this
new
year
eve
with
a
foolish
reckless
longing
that
made
him
half
deaf
to
his
importunate
companion
anxiety
dunsey
will
be
coming
home
soon
there
will
be
a
great
and
how
will
you
bribe
his
spite
to
silence
said
anxiety
oh
he
wo
come
home
before
new
year
eve
perhaps
said
godfrey
and
i
shall
sit
by
nancy
then
and
dance
with
her
and
get
a
kind
look
from
her
in
spite
of
herself
but
money
is
wanted
in
another
quarter
said
anxiety
in
a
louder
voice
and
how
will
you
get
it
without
selling
your
mother
diamond
pin
and
if
you
do
get
it
well
but
something
may
happen
to
make
things
easier
at
any
rate
there
one
pleasure
for
me
close
at
hand
nancy
is
coming
yes
and
suppose
your
father
should
bring
matters
to
a
pass
that
will
oblige
you
to
decline
marrying
her
and
to
give
your
reasons
hold
your
tongue
and
do
worry
me
i
can
see
nancy
eyes
just
as
they
will
look
at
me
and
feel
her
hand
in
mine
already
but
anxiety
went
on
though
in
noisy
christmas
company
refusing
to
be
utterly
quieted
even
by
much
drinking
chapter
xi
some
women
i
grant
would
not
appear
to
advantage
seated
on
a
pillion
and
attired
in
a
drab
joseph
and
a
drab
with
a
crown
resembling
a
small
for
a
garment
suggesting
a
greatcoat
cut
out
under
an
exiguity
of
cloth
that
would
only
allow
of
miniature
capes
is
not
well
adapted
to
conceal
deficiencies
of
contour
nor
is
drab
a
colour
that
will
throw
sallow
cheeks
into
lively
contrast
it
was
all
the
greater
triumph
to
miss
nancy
beauty
that
she
looked
thoroughly
bewitching
in
that
costume
as
seated
on
the
pillion
behind
her
tall
erect
father
she
held
one
arm
round
him
and
looked
down
with
anxiety
at
the
treacherous
pools
and
puddles
which
sent
up
formidable
splashings
of
mud
under
the
stamp
of
dobbin
foot
a
painter
would
perhaps
have
preferred
her
in
those
moments
when
she
was
free
from
but
certainly
the
bloom
on
her
cheeks
was
at
its
highest
point
of
contrast
with
the
surrounding
drab
when
she
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
red
house
and
saw
godfrey
cass
ready
to
lift
her
from
the
pillion
she
wished
her
sister
priscilla
had
come
up
at
the
same
time
behind
the
servant
for
then
she
would
have
contrived
that
godfrey
should
have
lifted
off
priscilla
first
and
in
the
meantime
she
would
have
persuaded
her
father
to
go
round
to
the
instead
of
alighting
at
the
it
was
very
painful
when
you
had
made
it
quite
clear
to
a
young
man
that
you
were
determined
not
to
marry
him
however
much
he
might
wish
it
that
he
would
still
continue
to
pay
you
marked
attentions
besides
why
he
always
show
the
same
attentions
if
he
meant
them
sincerely
instead
of
being
so
strange
as
godfrey
cass
was
sometimes
behaving
as
if
he
did
want
to
speak
to
her
and
taking
no
notice
of
her
for
weeks
and
weeks
and
then
all
on
a
sudden
almost
making
love
again
moreover
it
was
quite
plain
he
had
no
real
love
for
her
else
he
would
not
let
people
have
to
say
of
him
which
they
did
say
did
he
suppose
that
miss
nancy
lammeter
was
to
be
won
by
any
man
squire
or
no
squire
who
led
a
bad
life
that
was
not
what
she
had
been
used
to
see
in
her
own
father
who
was
the
soberest
and
best
man
in
that
only
a
little
hot
and
hasty
now
and
then
if
things
were
not
done
to
the
minute
all
these
thoughts
rushed
through
miss
nancy
mind
in
their
habitual
succession
in
the
moments
between
her
first
sight
of
godfrey
cass
standing
at
the
door
and
her
own
arrival
there
happily
the
squire
came
out
too
and
gave
a
loud
greeting
to
her
father
so
that
somehow
under
cover
of
this
noise
she
seemed
to
find
concealment
for
her
confusion
and
neglect
of
any
suitably
formal
behaviour
while
she
was
being
lifted
from
the
pillion
by
strong
arms
which
seemed
to
find
her
ridiculously
small
and
light
and
there
was
the
best
reason
for
hastening
into
the
house
at
once
since
the
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
again
threatening
an
unpleasant
journey
for
such
guests
as
were
still
on
the
road
these
were
a
small
minority
for
already
the
afternoon
was
beginning
to
decline
and
there
would
not
be
too
much
time
for
the
ladies
who
came
from
a
distance
to
attire
themselves
in
readiness
for
the
early
tea
which
was
to
inspirit
them
for
the
dance
there
was
a
buzz
of
voices
through
the
house
as
miss
nancy
entered
mingled
with
the
scrape
of
a
fiddle
preluding
in
the
kitchen
but
the
lammeters
were
guests
whose
arrival
had
evidently
been
thought
of
so
much
that
it
had
been
watched
for
from
the
windows
for
kimble
who
did
the
honours
at
the
red
house
on
these
great
occasions
came
forward
to
meet
miss
nancy
in
the
hall
and
conduct
her
kimble
was
the
squire
sister
as
well
as
the
doctor
wife
a
double
dignity
with
which
her
diameter
was
in
direct
proportion
so
that
a
journey
being
rather
fatiguing
to
her
she
did
not
oppose
miss
nancy
request
to
be
allowed
to
find
her
way
alone
to
the
blue
room
where
the
miss
lammeters
bandboxes
had
been
deposited
on
their
arrival
in
the
morning
there
was
hardly
a
bedroom
in
the
house
where
feminine
compliments
were
not
passing
and
feminine
toilettes
going
forward
in
various
stages
in
space
made
scanty
by
extra
beds
spread
upon
the
floor
and
miss
nancy
as
she
entered
the
blue
room
had
to
make
her
little
formal
curtsy
to
a
group
of
six
on
the
one
hand
there
were
ladies
no
less
important
than
the
two
miss
gunns
the
wine
merchant
daughters
from
lytherly
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
with
the
tightest
skirts
and
the
shortest
waists
and
gazed
at
by
miss
ladbrook
of
the
old
pastures
with
a
shyness
not
unsustained
by
inward
criticism
partly
miss
ladbrook
felt
that
her
own
skirt
must
be
regarded
as
unduly
lax
by
the
miss
gunns
and
partly
that
it
was
a
pity
the
miss
gunns
did
not
show
that
judgment
which
she
herself
would
show
if
she
were
in
their
place
by
stopping
a
little
on
this
side
of
the
fashion
on
the
other
hand
ladbrook
was
standing
in
and
front
with
her
turban
in
her
hand
curtsying
and
smiling
blandly
and
saying
after
you
to
another
lady
in
similar
circumstances
who
had
politely
offered
the
precedence
at
the
but
miss
nancy
had
no
sooner
made
her
curtsy
than
an
elderly
lady
came
forward
whose
full
white
muslin
kerchief
and
round
her
curls
of
smooth
grey
hair
were
in
daring
contrast
with
the
puffed
yellow
satins
and
caps
of
her
neighbours
she
approached
miss
nancy
with
much
primness
and
said
with
a
slow
treble
suavity
niece
i
hope
i
see
you
well
in
health
miss
nancy
kissed
her
cheek
dutifully
and
answered
with
the
same
sort
of
amiable
primness
quite
well
i
thank
you
aunt
and
i
hope
i
see
you
the
same
thank
you
niece
i
keep
my
health
for
the
present
and
how
is
my
these
dutiful
questions
and
answers
were
continued
until
it
was
ascertained
in
detail
that
the
lammeters
were
all
as
well
as
usual
and
the
osgoods
likewise
also
that
niece
priscilla
must
certainly
arrive
shortly
and
that
travelling
on
pillions
in
snowy
weather
was
unpleasant
though
a
joseph
was
a
great
protection
then
nancy
was
formally
introduced
to
her
aunt
visitors
the
miss
gunns
as
being
the
daughters
of
a
mother
known
to
mother
though
now
for
the
first
time
induced
to
make
a
journey
into
these
parts
and
these
ladies
were
so
taken
by
surprise
at
finding
such
a
lovely
face
and
figure
in
an
country
place
that
they
began
to
feel
some
curiosity
about
the
dress
she
would
put
on
when
she
took
off
her
joseph
miss
nancy
whose
thoughts
were
always
conducted
with
the
propriety
and
moderation
conspicuous
in
her
manners
remarked
to
herself
that
the
miss
gunns
were
rather
than
otherwise
and
that
such
very
low
dresses
as
they
wore
might
have
been
attributed
to
vanity
if
their
shoulders
had
been
pretty
but
that
being
as
they
were
it
was
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
showed
their
necks
from
a
love
of
display
but
rather
from
some
obligation
not
inconsistent
with
sense
and
modesty
she
felt
convinced
as
she
opened
her
box
that
this
must
be
her
aunt
osgood
opinion
for
miss
nancy
mind
resembled
her
aunt
to
a
degree
that
everybody
said
was
surprising
considering
the
kinship
was
on
osgood
side
and
though
you
might
not
have
supposed
it
from
the
formality
of
their
greeting
there
was
a
devoted
attachment
and
mutual
admiration
between
aunt
and
niece
even
miss
nancy
refusal
of
her
cousin
gilbert
osgood
on
the
ground
solely
that
he
was
her
cousin
though
it
had
grieved
her
aunt
greatly
had
not
in
the
least
cooled
the
preference
which
had
determined
her
to
leave
nancy
several
of
her
hereditary
ornaments
let
gilbert
future
wife
be
whom
she
might
three
of
the
ladies
quickly
retired
but
the
miss
gunns
were
quite
content
that
osgood
inclination
to
remain
with
her
niece
gave
them
also
a
reason
for
staying
to
see
the
rustic
beauty
toilette
and
it
was
really
a
pleasure
from
the
first
opening
of
the
bandbox
where
everything
smelt
of
lavender
and
to
the
clasping
of
the
small
coral
necklace
that
fitted
closely
round
her
little
white
neck
everything
belonging
to
miss
nancy
was
of
delicate
purity
and
nattiness
not
a
crease
was
where
it
had
no
business
to
be
not
a
bit
of
her
linen
professed
whiteness
without
fulfilling
its
profession
the
very
pins
on
her
pincushion
were
stuck
in
after
a
pattern
from
which
she
was
careful
to
allow
no
aberration
and
as
for
her
own
person
it
gave
the
same
idea
of
perfect
unvarying
neatness
as
the
body
of
a
little
bird
it
is
true
that
her
hair
was
cropped
behind
like
a
boy
and
was
dressed
in
front
in
a
number
of
flat
rings
that
lay
quite
away
from
her
face
but
there
was
no
sort
of
coiffure
that
could
make
miss
nancy
cheek
and
neck
look
otherwise
than
pretty
and
when
at
last
she
stood
complete
in
her
silvery
twilled
silk
her
lace
tucker
her
coral
necklace
and
coral
the
miss
gunns
could
see
nothing
to
criticise
except
her
hands
which
bore
the
traces
of
and
even
still
coarser
work
but
miss
nancy
was
not
ashamed
of
that
for
even
while
she
was
dressing
she
narrated
to
her
aunt
how
she
and
priscilla
had
packed
their
boxes
yesterday
because
this
morning
was
baking
morning
and
since
they
were
leaving
home
it
was
desirable
to
make
a
good
supply
of
for
the
kitchen
and
as
she
concluded
this
judicious
remark
she
turned
to
the
miss
gunns
that
she
might
not
commit
the
rudeness
of
not
including
them
in
the
conversation
the
miss
gunns
smiled
stiffly
and
thought
what
a
pity
it
was
that
these
rich
country
people
who
could
afford
to
buy
such
good
clothes
really
miss
nancy
lace
and
silk
were
very
costly
should
be
brought
up
in
utter
ignorance
and
vulgarity
she
actually
said
mate
for
meat
for
perhaps
and
oss
for
horse
which
to
young
ladies
living
in
good
lytherly
society
who
habitually
said
even
in
domestic
privacy
and
only
said
on
the
right
occasions
was
necessarily
shocking
miss
nancy
indeed
had
never
been
to
any
school
higher
than
dame
tedman
her
acquaintance
with
profane
literature
hardly
went
beyond
the
rhymes
she
had
worked
in
her
large
sampler
under
the
lamb
and
the
shepherdess
and
in
order
to
balance
an
account
she
was
obliged
to
effect
her
subtraction
by
removing
visible
metallic
shillings
and
sixpences
from
a
visible
metallic
total
there
is
hardly
a
in
these
days
who
is
not
better
informed
than
miss
nancy
yet
she
had
the
essential
attributes
of
a
lady
high
veracity
delicate
honour
in
her
dealings
deference
to
others
and
refined
personal
habits
and
lest
these
should
not
suffice
to
convince
grammatical
fair
ones
that
her
feelings
can
at
all
resemble
theirs
i
will
add
that
she
was
slightly
proud
and
exacting
and
as
constant
in
her
affection
towards
a
baseless
opinion
as
towards
an
erring
lover
the
anxiety
about
sister
priscilla
which
had
grown
rather
active
by
the
time
the
coral
necklace
was
clasped
was
happily
ended
by
the
entrance
of
that
lady
herself
with
a
face
made
blowsy
by
cold
and
damp
after
the
first
questions
and
greetings
she
turned
to
nancy
and
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
then
wheeled
her
round
to
ascertain
that
the
back
view
was
equally
faultless
what
do
you
think
o
gowns
aunt
osgood
said
priscilla
while
nancy
helped
her
to
unrobe
very
handsome
indeed
niece
said
osgood
with
a
slight
increase
of
formality
she
always
thought
niece
priscilla
too
rough
i
obliged
to
have
the
same
as
nancy
you
know
for
all
i
five
years
older
and
it
makes
me
look
yallow
for
she
never
have
anything
without
i
have
mine
just
like
it
because
she
wants
us
to
look
like
sisters
and
i
tell
her
folks
think
it
my
weakness
makes
me
fancy
as
i
shall
look
pretty
in
what
she
looks
pretty
in
for
i
ugly
there
no
denying
that
i
feature
my
father
family
but
law
i
do
mind
do
you
priscilla
here
turned
to
the
miss
gunns
rattling
on
in
too
much
preoccupation
with
the
delight
of
talking
to
notice
that
her
candour
was
not
appreciated
the
pretty
uns
do
for
they
keep
the
men
off
us
i
no
opinion
o
the
men
miss
gunn
i
do
know
what
have
and
as
for
fretting
and
stewing
about
what
think
of
you
from
morning
till
night
and
making
your
life
uneasy
about
what
they
doing
when
they
out
your
sight
as
i
tell
nancy
it
a
folly
no
woman
need
be
guilty
of
if
she
got
a
good
father
and
a
good
home
let
her
leave
it
to
them
as
have
got
no
fortin
and
ca
help
themselves
as
i
say
is
the
best
husband
and
the
only
one
i
ever
promise
to
obey
i
know
it
is
pleasant
when
you
been
used
to
living
in
a
big
way
and
managing
hogsheads
and
all
that
to
go
and
put
your
nose
in
by
somebody
else
fireside
or
to
sit
down
by
yourself
to
a
scrag
or
a
knuckle
but
thank
god
my
father
a
sober
man
and
likely
to
live
and
if
you
got
a
man
by
the
it
does
matter
if
he
childish
the
business
need
be
broke
up
the
delicate
process
of
getting
her
narrow
gown
over
her
head
without
injury
to
her
smooth
curls
obliged
miss
priscilla
to
pause
in
this
rapid
survey
of
life
and
osgood
seized
the
opportunity
of
rising
and
saying
well
niece
you
follow
us
the
miss
gunns
will
like
to
go
down
sister
said
nancy
when
they
were
alone
you
offended
the
miss
gunns
i
sure
what
have
i
done
child
said
priscilla
in
some
alarm
why
you
asked
them
if
they
minded
about
being
ugly
you
so
very
blunt
law
did
i
well
it
popped
out
it
a
mercy
i
said
no
more
for
a
bad
un
to
live
with
folks
when
they
do
like
the
truth
but
as
for
being
ugly
look
at
me
child
in
this
silk
i
told
you
how
it
be
i
look
as
yallow
as
a
daffadil
anybody
say
you
wanted
to
make
a
mawkin
of
me
no
priscy
do
say
so
i
begged
and
prayed
of
you
not
to
let
us
have
this
silk
if
you
like
another
better
i
was
willing
to
have
choice
you
know
i
was
said
nancy
in
anxious
nonsense
child
you
know
you
set
your
heart
on
this
and
reason
good
for
you
the
colour
o
cream
it
be
fine
doings
for
you
to
dress
yourself
to
suit
skin
what
i
find
fault
with
is
that
notion
o
yours
as
i
must
dress
myself
just
like
you
but
you
do
as
you
like
with
me
you
always
did
from
when
first
you
begun
to
walk
if
you
wanted
to
go
the
field
length
the
field
length
you
go
and
there
was
no
whipping
you
for
you
looked
as
prim
and
innicent
as
a
daisy
all
the
while
priscy
said
nancy
gently
as
she
fastened
a
coral
necklace
exactly
like
her
own
round
priscilla
neck
which
was
very
far
from
being
like
her
own
i
sure
i
willing
to
give
way
as
far
as
is
right
but
who
should
dress
alike
if
it
is
sisters
would
you
have
us
go
about
looking
as
if
we
were
no
kin
to
one
another
us
that
have
got
no
mother
and
not
another
sister
in
the
world
i
do
what
was
right
if
i
dressed
in
a
gown
dyed
with
and
i
rather
choose
and
let
me
wear
what
pleases
you
there
you
go
again
you
come
round
to
the
same
thing
if
one
talked
to
you
from
saturday
night
till
saturday
morning
it
be
fine
fun
to
see
how
you
master
your
husband
and
never
raise
your
voice
above
the
singing
o
the
kettle
all
the
while
i
like
to
see
the
men
mastered
do
talk
priscy
said
nancy
blushing
you
know
i
mean
ever
to
be
married
oh
you
never
mean
a
fiddlestick
end
said
priscilla
as
she
arranged
her
discarded
dress
and
closed
her
bandbox
who
shall
have
to
work
for
when
father
gone
if
you
are
to
go
and
take
notions
in
your
head
and
be
an
old
maid
because
some
folks
are
no
better
than
they
should
be
i
have
a
bit
o
patience
with
you
sitting
on
an
addled
egg
for
ever
as
if
there
was
never
a
fresh
un
in
the
world
one
old
maid
enough
out
o
two
sisters
and
i
shall
do
credit
to
a
single
life
for
god
meant
me
for
it
come
we
can
go
down
now
i
as
ready
as
a
mawkin
be
there
nothing
awanting
to
frighten
the
crows
now
i
got
my
in
as
the
two
miss
lammeters
walked
into
the
large
parlour
together
any
one
who
did
not
know
the
character
of
both
might
certainly
have
supposed
that
the
reason
why
the
clumsy
priscilla
wore
a
dress
the
facsimile
of
her
pretty
sister
was
either
the
mistaken
vanity
of
the
one
or
the
malicious
contrivance
of
the
other
in
order
to
set
off
her
own
rare
beauty
but
the
cheeriness
and
of
priscilla
would
soon
have
dissipated
the
one
suspicion
and
the
modest
calm
of
nancy
speech
and
manners
told
clearly
of
a
mind
free
from
all
disavowed
devices
places
of
honour
had
been
kept
for
the
miss
lammeters
near
the
head
of
the
principal
in
the
wainscoted
parlour
now
looking
fresh
and
pleasant
with
handsome
branches
of
holly
yew
and
laurel
from
the
abundant
growths
of
the
old
garden
and
nancy
felt
an
inward
flutter
that
no
firmness
of
purpose
could
prevent
when
she
saw
godfrey
cass
advancing
to
lead
her
to
a
seat
between
himself
and
crackenthorp
while
priscilla
was
called
to
the
opposite
side
between
her
father
and
the
squire
it
certainly
did
make
some
difference
to
nancy
that
the
lover
she
had
given
up
was
the
young
man
of
quite
the
highest
consequence
in
the
parish
at
home
in
a
venerable
and
unique
parlour
which
was
the
extremity
of
grandeur
in
her
experience
a
parlour
where
might
one
day
have
been
mistress
with
the
consciousness
that
she
was
spoken
of
as
madam
cass
the
wife
these
circumstances
exalted
her
inward
drama
in
her
own
eyes
and
deepened
the
emphasis
with
which
she
declared
to
herself
that
not
the
most
dazzling
rank
should
induce
her
to
marry
a
man
whose
conduct
showed
him
careless
of
his
character
but
that
love
once
love
always
was
the
motto
of
a
true
and
pure
woman
and
no
man
should
ever
have
any
right
over
her
which
would
be
a
call
on
her
to
destroy
the
dried
flowers
that
she
treasured
and
always
would
treasure
for
godfrey
cass
sake
and
nancy
was
capable
of
keeping
her
word
to
herself
under
very
trying
conditions
nothing
but
a
becoming
blush
betrayed
the
moving
thoughts
that
urged
themselves
upon
her
as
she
accepted
the
seat
next
to
crackenthorp
for
she
was
so
instinctively
neat
and
adroit
in
all
her
actions
and
her
pretty
lips
met
each
other
with
such
quiet
firmness
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
her
to
appear
agitated
it
was
not
the
rector
practice
to
let
a
charming
blush
pass
without
an
appropriate
compliment
he
was
not
in
the
least
lofty
or
aristocratic
but
simply
a
man
with
his
chin
propped
by
an
ample
white
neckcloth
which
seemed
to
predominate
over
every
other
point
in
his
person
and
somehow
to
impress
its
peculiar
character
on
his
remarks
so
that
to
have
considered
his
amenities
apart
from
his
cravat
would
have
been
a
severe
and
perhaps
a
dangerous
effort
of
abstraction
ha
miss
nancy
he
said
turning
his
head
within
his
cravat
and
smiling
down
pleasantly
upon
her
when
anybody
pretends
this
has
been
a
severe
winter
i
shall
tell
them
i
saw
the
roses
blooming
on
new
year
eve
eh
godfrey
what
do
say
godfrey
made
no
reply
and
avoided
looking
at
nancy
very
markedly
for
though
these
complimentary
personalities
were
held
to
be
in
excellent
taste
in
raveloe
society
reverent
love
has
a
politeness
of
its
own
which
it
teaches
to
men
otherwise
of
small
schooling
but
the
squire
was
rather
impatient
at
godfrey
showing
himself
a
dull
spark
in
this
way
by
this
advanced
hour
of
the
day
the
squire
was
always
in
higher
spirits
than
we
have
seen
him
in
at
the
and
felt
it
quite
pleasant
to
fulfil
the
hereditary
duty
of
being
noisily
jovial
and
patronizing
the
large
silver
was
in
active
service
and
was
offered
without
fail
to
all
neighbours
from
time
to
time
however
often
they
might
have
declined
the
favour
at
present
the
squire
had
only
given
an
express
welcome
to
the
heads
of
families
as
they
appeared
but
always
as
the
evening
deepened
his
hospitality
rayed
out
more
widely
till
he
had
tapped
the
youngest
guests
on
the
back
and
shown
a
peculiar
fondness
for
their
presence
in
the
full
belief
that
they
must
feel
their
lives
made
happy
by
their
belonging
to
a
parish
where
there
was
such
a
hearty
man
as
squire
cass
to
invite
them
and
wish
them
well
even
in
this
early
stage
of
the
jovial
mood
it
was
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
supply
his
son
deficiencies
by
looking
and
speaking
for
him
aye
aye
he
began
offering
his
to
lammeter
who
for
the
second
time
bowed
his
head
and
waved
his
hand
in
stiff
rejection
of
the
offer
us
old
fellows
may
wish
ourselves
young
when
we
see
the
in
the
white
parlour
it
true
most
things
are
gone
in
these
last
thirty
years
the
country
going
down
since
the
old
king
fell
ill
but
when
i
look
at
miss
nancy
here
i
begin
to
think
the
lasses
keep
up
their
quality
ding
me
if
i
remember
a
sample
to
match
her
not
when
i
was
a
fine
young
fellow
and
thought
a
deal
about
my
pigtail
no
offence
to
you
madam
he
added
bending
to
crackenthorp
who
sat
by
him
i
did
know
when
you
were
as
young
as
miss
nancy
here
crackenthorp
a
small
blinking
woman
who
fidgeted
incessantly
with
her
lace
ribbons
and
gold
chain
turning
her
head
about
and
making
subdued
noises
very
much
like
a
that
twitches
its
nose
and
soliloquizes
in
all
company
indiscriminately
now
blinked
and
fidgeted
towards
the
squire
and
said
oh
no
no
offence
this
emphatic
compliment
of
the
squire
to
nancy
was
felt
by
others
besides
godfrey
to
have
a
diplomatic
significance
and
her
father
gave
a
slight
additional
erectness
to
his
back
as
he
looked
across
the
table
at
her
with
complacent
gravity
that
grave
and
orderly
senior
was
not
going
to
bate
a
jot
of
his
dignity
by
seeming
elated
at
the
notion
of
a
match
between
his
family
and
the
squire
he
was
gratified
by
any
honour
paid
to
his
daughter
but
he
must
see
an
alteration
in
several
ways
before
his
consent
would
be
vouchsafed
his
spare
but
healthy
person
and
firm
face
that
looked
as
if
it
had
never
been
flushed
by
excess
was
in
strong
contrast
not
only
with
the
squire
but
with
the
appearance
of
the
raveloe
farmers
generally
in
accordance
with
a
favourite
saying
of
his
own
that
breed
was
stronger
than
pasture
miss
nancy
wonderful
like
what
her
mother
was
though
is
she
kimble
said
the
stout
lady
of
that
name
looking
round
for
her
husband
but
doctor
kimble
country
apothecaries
in
old
days
enjoyed
that
title
without
authority
of
diploma
being
a
thin
and
agile
man
was
flitting
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
making
himself
agreeable
to
his
feminine
patients
with
medical
impartiality
and
being
welcomed
everywhere
as
a
doctor
by
hereditary
right
not
one
of
those
miserable
apothecaries
who
canvass
for
practice
in
strange
neighbourhoods
and
spend
all
their
income
in
starving
their
one
horse
but
a
man
of
substance
able
to
keep
an
extravagant
table
like
the
best
of
his
patients
time
out
of
mind
the
raveloe
doctor
had
been
a
kimble
kimble
was
inherently
a
doctor
name
and
it
was
difficult
to
contemplate
firmly
the
melancholy
fact
that
the
actual
kimble
had
no
son
so
that
his
practice
might
one
day
be
handed
over
to
a
successor
with
the
incongruous
name
of
taylor
or
johnson
but
in
that
case
the
wiser
people
in
raveloe
would
employ
blick
of
flitton
as
less
unnatural
did
you
speak
to
me
my
dear
said
the
authentic
doctor
coming
quickly
to
his
wife
side
but
as
if
foreseeing
that
she
would
be
too
much
out
of
breath
to
repeat
her
remark
he
went
on
immediately
ha
miss
priscilla
the
sight
of
you
revives
the
taste
of
that
i
hope
the
batch
is
near
an
end
yes
indeed
it
is
doctor
said
priscilla
but
i
answer
for
it
the
next
shall
be
as
good
my
do
turn
out
well
by
chance
not
as
your
doctoring
does
eh
kimble
because
folks
forget
to
take
your
physic
eh
said
the
squire
who
regarded
physic
and
doctors
as
many
loyal
churchmen
regard
the
church
and
the
clergy
tasting
a
joke
against
them
when
he
was
in
health
but
impatiently
eager
for
their
aid
when
anything
was
the
matter
with
him
he
tapped
his
box
and
looked
round
with
a
triumphant
laugh
ah
she
has
a
quick
wit
my
friend
priscilla
has
said
the
doctor
choosing
to
attribute
the
epigram
to
a
lady
rather
than
allow
a
that
advantage
over
him
she
saves
a
little
pepper
to
sprinkle
over
her
talk
that
the
reason
why
she
never
puts
too
much
into
her
pies
there
my
wife
now
she
never
has
an
answer
at
her
tongue
end
but
if
i
offend
her
she
sure
to
scarify
my
throat
with
black
pepper
the
next
day
or
else
give
me
the
colic
with
watery
greens
that
an
awful
here
the
vivacious
doctor
made
a
pathetic
grimace
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
said
kimble
laughing
above
her
double
chin
with
much
aside
to
crackenthorp
who
blinked
and
nodded
and
seemed
to
intend
a
smile
which
by
the
correlation
of
forces
went
off
in
small
twitchings
and
noises
i
suppose
that
the
sort
of
adopted
in
your
profession
kimble
if
you
a
grudge
against
a
patient
said
the
rector
never
do
have
a
grudge
against
our
patients
said
kimble
except
when
they
leave
us
and
then
you
see
we
have
the
chance
of
prescribing
for
ha
miss
nancy
he
continued
suddenly
skipping
to
nancy
side
you
wo
forget
your
promise
you
to
save
a
dance
for
me
you
know
come
come
kimble
do
you
be
too
said
the
squire
give
the
young
uns
there
my
son
godfrey
be
wanting
to
have
a
round
with
you
if
you
run
off
with
miss
nancy
he
bespoke
her
for
the
first
dance
i
be
bound
eh
sir
what
do
you
say
he
continued
throwing
himself
backward
and
looking
at
godfrey
you
asked
miss
nancy
to
open
the
dance
with
you
godfrey
sorely
uncomfortable
under
this
significant
insistence
about
nancy
and
afraid
to
think
where
it
would
end
by
the
time
his
father
had
set
his
usual
hospitable
example
of
drinking
before
and
after
supper
saw
no
course
open
but
to
turn
to
nancy
and
say
with
as
little
awkwardness
as
possible
no
i
not
asked
her
yet
but
i
hope
she
consent
if
somebody
else
has
been
before
me
no
i
not
engaged
myself
said
nancy
quietly
though
blushingly
if
godfrey
founded
any
hopes
on
her
consenting
to
dance
with
him
he
would
soon
be
undeceived
but
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
be
uncivil
then
i
hope
you
no
objections
to
dancing
with
me
said
godfrey
beginning
to
lose
the
sense
that
there
was
anything
uncomfortable
in
this
arrangement
no
no
objections
said
nancy
in
a
cold
tone
ah
well
you
a
lucky
fellow
godfrey
said
uncle
kimble
but
you
my
godson
so
i
wo
stand
in
your
way
else
i
not
so
very
old
eh
my
dear
he
went
on
skipping
to
his
wife
side
again
you
would
mind
my
having
a
second
after
you
were
gone
not
if
i
cried
a
good
deal
first
come
come
take
a
cup
o
tea
and
stop
your
tongue
do
said
kimble
feeling
some
pride
in
a
husband
who
must
be
regarded
as
so
clever
and
amusing
by
the
company
generally
if
he
had
only
not
been
irritable
at
cards
while
safe
personalities
were
enlivening
the
tea
in
this
way
the
sound
of
the
fiddle
approaching
within
a
distance
at
which
it
could
be
heard
distinctly
made
the
young
people
look
at
each
other
with
sympathetic
impatience
for
the
end
of
the
meal
why
there
solomon
in
the
hall
said
the
squire
and
playing
my
tune
believe
the
ploughboy
he
for
giving
us
a
hint
as
we
are
enough
in
a
hurry
to
hear
him
play
bob
he
called
out
to
his
third
son
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
open
the
door
and
tell
solomon
to
come
in
he
shall
give
us
a
tune
here
bob
obeyed
and
solomon
walked
in
fiddling
as
he
walked
for
he
would
on
no
account
break
off
in
the
middle
of
a
tune
here
solomon
said
the
squire
with
loud
patronage
round
here
my
man
ah
i
knew
it
was
the
ploughboy
there
no
finer
tune
solomon
macey
a
small
hale
old
man
with
an
abundant
crop
of
long
white
hair
reaching
nearly
to
his
shoulders
advanced
to
the
indicated
spot
bowing
reverently
while
he
fiddled
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
respected
the
company
though
he
respected
the
more
as
soon
as
he
had
repeated
the
tune
and
lowered
his
fiddle
he
bowed
again
to
the
squire
and
the
rector
and
said
i
hope
i
see
your
honour
and
your
reverence
well
and
wishing
you
health
and
long
life
and
a
happy
new
year
and
wishing
the
same
to
you
lammeter
sir
and
to
the
other
gentlemen
and
the
madams
and
the
young
lasses
as
solomon
uttered
the
last
words
he
bowed
in
all
directions
solicitously
lest
he
should
be
wanting
in
due
respect
but
thereupon
he
immediately
began
to
prelude
and
fell
into
the
tune
which
he
knew
would
be
taken
as
a
special
compliment
by
lammeter
thank
ye
solomon
thank
ye
said
lammeter
when
the
fiddle
paused
again
that
over
the
hills
and
far
away
that
is
my
father
used
to
say
to
me
whenever
we
heard
that
tune
ah
lad
come
from
over
the
hills
and
far
away
there
a
many
tunes
i
do
make
head
or
tail
of
but
that
speaks
to
me
like
the
blackbird
whistle
i
suppose
it
the
name
there
a
deal
in
the
name
of
a
tune
but
solomon
was
already
impatient
to
prelude
again
and
presently
broke
with
much
spirit
into
sir
roger
de
coverley
at
which
there
was
a
sound
of
chairs
pushed
back
and
laughing
voices
aye
aye
solomon
we
know
what
that
means
said
the
squire
rising
it
time
to
begin
the
dance
eh
lead
the
way
then
and
we
all
follow
you
so
solomon
holding
his
white
head
on
one
side
and
playing
vigorously
marched
forward
at
the
head
of
the
gay
procession
into
the
white
parlour
where
the
was
hung
and
multitudinous
tallow
candles
made
rather
a
brilliant
effect
gleaming
from
among
the
berried
and
reflected
in
the
oval
mirrors
fastened
in
the
panels
of
the
white
wainscot
a
quaint
procession
old
solomon
in
his
seedy
clothes
and
long
white
locks
seemed
to
be
luring
that
decent
company
by
the
magic
scream
of
his
fiddle
luring
discreet
matrons
in
caps
nay
crackenthorp
herself
the
summit
of
whose
perpendicular
feather
was
on
a
level
with
the
shoulder
luring
fair
lasses
complacently
conscious
of
very
short
waists
and
skirts
blameless
of
luring
burly
fathers
in
large
variegated
waistcoats
and
ruddy
sons
for
the
most
part
shy
and
sheepish
in
short
nether
garments
and
very
long
already
macey
and
a
few
other
privileged
villagers
who
were
allowed
to
be
spectators
on
these
great
occasions
were
seated
on
benches
placed
for
them
near
the
door
and
great
was
the
admiration
and
satisfaction
in
that
quarter
when
the
couples
had
formed
themselves
for
the
dance
and
the
squire
led
off
with
crackenthorp
joining
hands
with
the
rector
and
osgood
that
was
as
it
should
be
that
was
what
everybody
had
been
used
to
and
the
charter
of
raveloe
seemed
to
be
renewed
by
the
ceremony
it
was
not
thought
of
as
an
unbecoming
levity
for
the
old
and
people
to
dance
a
little
before
sitting
down
to
cards
but
rather
as
part
of
their
social
duties
for
what
were
these
if
not
to
be
merry
at
appropriate
times
interchanging
visits
and
poultry
with
due
frequency
paying
each
other
compliments
in
sound
traditional
phrases
passing
personal
jokes
urging
your
guests
to
eat
and
drink
too
much
out
of
hospitality
and
eating
and
drinking
too
much
in
your
neighbour
house
to
show
that
you
liked
your
cheer
and
the
parson
naturally
set
an
example
in
these
social
duties
for
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
the
raveloe
mind
without
a
peculiar
revelation
to
know
that
a
clergyman
should
be
a
memento
of
solemnities
instead
of
a
reasonably
faulty
man
whose
exclusive
authority
to
read
prayers
and
preach
to
christen
marry
and
bury
you
necessarily
coexisted
with
the
right
to
sell
you
the
ground
to
be
buried
in
and
to
take
tithe
in
kind
on
which
last
point
of
course
there
was
a
little
grumbling
but
not
to
the
extent
of
irreligion
not
of
deeper
significance
than
the
grumbling
at
the
rain
which
was
by
no
means
accompanied
with
a
spirit
of
impious
defiance
but
with
a
desire
that
the
prayer
for
fine
weather
might
be
read
forthwith
there
was
no
reason
then
why
the
rector
dancing
should
not
be
received
as
part
of
the
fitness
of
things
quite
as
much
as
the
squire
or
why
on
the
other
hand
macey
official
respect
should
restrain
him
from
subjecting
the
parson
performance
to
that
criticism
with
which
minds
of
extraordinary
acuteness
must
necessarily
contemplate
the
doings
of
their
fallible
the
squire
pretty
springe
considering
his
weight
said
macey
and
he
stamps
uncommon
well
but
lammeter
beats
all
for
shapes
you
see
he
holds
his
head
like
a
sodger
and
he
is
so
cushiony
as
most
o
the
oldish
gentlefolks
they
run
fat
in
general
and
he
got
a
fine
leg
the
parson
nimble
enough
but
he
has
got
much
of
a
leg
it
a
bit
too
thick
and
his
knees
might
be
a
bit
nearer
damage
but
he
might
do
worse
he
might
do
worse
though
he
has
that
grand
way
o
waving
his
hand
as
the
squire
has
talk
o
nimbleness
look
at
osgood
said
ben
winthrop
who
was
holding
his
son
aaron
between
his
knees
she
trips
along
with
her
little
steps
so
as
nobody
can
see
how
she
goes
it
like
as
if
she
had
little
wheels
to
her
feet
she
does
look
a
day
older
nor
last
year
she
the
woman
as
is
let
the
next
be
where
she
will
i
do
heed
how
the
women
are
made
said
macey
with
some
contempt
they
wear
nayther
coat
nor
breeches
you
ca
make
much
out
o
their
shapes
fayder
said
aaron
whose
feet
were
busy
beating
out
the
tune
how
does
that
big
stick
in
crackenthorp
yead
is
there
a
little
hole
for
it
like
in
my
hush
lad
hush
that
the
way
the
ladies
dress
theirselves
that
is
said
the
father
adding
however
in
an
undertone
to
macey
it
does
make
her
look
funny
though
partly
like
a
bottle
wi
a
long
quill
in
it
hey
by
jingo
there
the
young
squire
leading
off
now
wi
miss
nancy
for
partners
there
a
lass
for
you
like
a
posy
there
nobody
think
as
anybody
could
be
so
pritty
i
should
wonder
if
she
madam
cass
some
day
arter
all
and
nobody
more
rightfuller
for
they
make
a
fine
match
you
can
find
nothing
against
master
godfrey
shapes
macey
bet
a
penny
macey
screwed
up
his
mouth
leaned
his
head
further
on
one
side
and
twirled
his
thumbs
with
a
presto
movement
as
his
eyes
followed
godfrey
up
the
dance
at
last
he
summed
up
his
opinion
pretty
well
but
a
bit
too
round
i
the
and
as
for
them
coats
as
he
gets
from
the
flitton
tailor
they
a
poor
cut
to
pay
double
money
for
ah
macey
you
and
me
are
two
folks
said
ben
slightly
indignant
at
this
carping
when
i
got
a
pot
o
good
ale
i
like
to
swaller
it
and
do
my
inside
good
o
smelling
and
staring
at
it
to
see
if
i
ca
find
faut
wi
the
brewing
i
should
like
you
to
pick
me
out
a
young
fellow
nor
master
godfrey
one
as
knock
you
down
easier
or
more
when
he
piert
and
merry
tchuh
said
macey
provoked
to
increased
severity
he
come
to
his
right
colour
yet
he
partly
like
a
pie
and
i
doubt
he
got
a
soft
place
in
his
head
else
why
should
he
be
turned
round
the
finger
by
that
offal
dunsey
as
nobody
seen
o
late
and
let
him
kill
that
fine
hunting
hoss
as
was
the
talk
o
the
country
and
one
while
he
was
allays
after
miss
nancy
and
then
it
all
went
off
again
like
a
smell
o
hot
porridge
as
i
may
say
that
was
my
way
when
went
ah
but
mayhap
miss
nancy
hung
off
like
and
your
lass
did
said
ben
i
should
say
she
did
said
macey
significantly
before
i
said
sniff
i
took
care
to
know
as
she
say
snaff
and
pretty
quick
too
i
was
to
open
mouth
like
a
dog
at
a
fly
and
snap
it
to
again
wi
nothing
to
swaller
well
i
think
miss
nancy
round
again
said
ben
for
master
godfrey
does
look
so
and
i
see
for
taking
her
away
to
sit
down
now
they
at
the
end
o
the
dance
that
looks
like
sweethearting
that
does
the
reason
why
godfrey
and
nancy
had
left
the
dance
was
not
so
tender
as
ben
imagined
in
the
close
press
of
couples
a
slight
accident
had
happened
to
nancy
dress
which
while
it
was
short
enough
to
show
her
neat
ankle
in
front
was
long
enough
behind
to
be
caught
under
the
stately
stamp
of
the
squire
foot
so
as
to
rend
certain
stitches
at
the
waist
and
cause
much
sisterly
agitation
in
priscilla
mind
as
well
as
serious
concern
in
nancy
one
thoughts
may
be
much
occupied
with
but
hardly
so
as
to
be
insensible
to
a
disorder
in
the
general
framework
of
things
nancy
had
no
sooner
completed
her
duty
in
the
figure
they
were
dancing
than
she
said
to
godfrey
with
a
deep
blush
that
she
must
go
and
sit
down
till
priscilla
could
come
to
her
for
the
sisters
had
already
exchanged
a
short
whisper
and
an
glance
full
of
meaning
no
reason
less
urgent
than
this
could
have
prevailed
on
nancy
to
give
godfrey
this
opportunity
of
sitting
apart
with
her
as
for
godfrey
he
was
feeling
so
happy
and
oblivious
under
the
long
charm
of
the
with
nancy
that
he
got
rather
bold
on
the
strength
of
her
confusion
and
was
capable
of
leading
her
straight
away
without
leave
asked
into
the
adjoining
small
parlour
where
the
were
set
oh
no
thank
you
said
nancy
coldly
as
soon
as
she
perceived
where
he
was
going
not
in
there
i
wait
here
till
priscilla
ready
to
come
to
me
i
sorry
to
bring
you
out
of
the
dance
and
make
myself
troublesome
why
you
be
more
comfortable
here
by
yourself
said
the
artful
godfrey
i
leave
you
here
till
your
sister
can
come
he
spoke
in
an
indifferent
tone
that
was
an
agreeable
proposition
and
just
what
nancy
desired
why
then
was
she
a
little
hurt
that
godfrey
should
make
it
they
entered
and
she
seated
herself
on
a
chair
against
one
of
the
as
the
stiffest
and
most
unapproachable
position
she
could
choose
thank
you
sir
she
said
immediately
i
need
give
you
any
more
trouble
i
sorry
you
had
such
an
unlucky
partner
that
very
of
you
said
godfrey
standing
by
her
without
any
sign
of
intended
departure
to
be
sorry
you
danced
with
me
oh
no
sir
i
do
mean
to
say
what
at
all
said
nancy
looking
distractingly
prim
and
pretty
when
gentlemen
have
so
many
pleasures
one
dance
can
matter
but
very
little
you
know
that
is
true
you
know
one
dance
with
you
matters
more
to
me
than
all
the
other
pleasures
in
the
world
it
was
a
long
long
while
since
godfrey
had
said
anything
so
direct
as
that
and
nancy
was
startled
but
her
instinctive
dignity
and
repugnance
to
any
show
of
emotion
made
her
sit
perfectly
still
and
only
throw
a
little
more
decision
into
her
voice
as
she
said
no
indeed
godfrey
that
not
known
to
me
and
i
have
very
good
reasons
for
thinking
different
but
if
it
true
i
do
wish
to
hear
it
would
you
never
forgive
me
then
nancy
never
think
well
of
me
let
what
would
happen
would
you
never
think
the
present
made
amends
for
the
past
not
if
i
turned
a
good
fellow
and
gave
up
everything
you
did
like
godfrey
was
half
conscious
that
this
sudden
opportunity
of
speaking
to
nancy
alone
had
driven
him
beside
himself
but
blind
feeling
had
got
the
mastery
of
his
tongue
nancy
really
felt
much
agitated
by
the
possibility
godfrey
words
suggested
but
this
very
pressure
of
emotion
that
she
was
in
danger
of
finding
too
strong
for
her
roused
all
her
power
of
i
should
be
glad
to
see
a
good
change
in
anybody
godfrey
she
answered
with
the
slightest
discernible
difference
of
tone
but
it
be
better
if
no
change
was
wanted
you
very
nancy
said
godfrey
pettishly
you
might
encourage
me
to
be
a
better
fellow
i
very
miserable
but
you
no
feeling
i
think
those
have
the
least
feeling
that
act
wrong
to
begin
with
said
nancy
sending
out
a
flash
in
spite
of
herself
godfrey
was
delighted
with
that
little
flash
and
would
have
liked
to
go
on
and
make
her
quarrel
with
him
nancy
was
so
exasperatingly
quiet
and
firm
but
she
was
not
indifferent
to
him
though
the
entrance
of
priscilla
bustling
forward
and
saying
dear
heart
alive
child
let
us
look
at
this
gown
cut
off
godfrey
hopes
of
a
quarrel
i
suppose
i
must
go
now
he
said
to
priscilla
it
no
matter
to
me
whether
you
go
or
stay
said
that
frank
lady
searching
for
something
in
her
pocket
with
a
preoccupied
brow
do
want
me
to
go
said
godfrey
looking
at
nancy
who
was
now
standing
up
by
priscilla
order
as
you
like
said
nancy
trying
to
recover
all
her
former
coldness
and
looking
down
carefully
at
the
hem
of
her
gown
then
i
like
to
stay
said
godfrey
with
a
reckless
determination
to
get
as
much
of
this
joy
as
he
could
and
think
nothing
of
the
morrow
chapter
xii
while
godfrey
cass
was
taking
draughts
of
forgetfulness
from
the
sweet
presence
of
nancy
willingly
losing
all
sense
of
that
hidden
bond
which
at
other
moments
galled
and
fretted
him
so
as
to
mingle
irritation
with
the
very
sunshine
godfrey
wife
was
walking
with
slow
uncertain
steps
through
the
raveloe
lanes
carrying
her
child
in
her
arms
this
journey
on
new
year
eve
was
a
premeditated
act
of
vengeance
which
she
had
kept
in
her
heart
ever
since
godfrey
in
a
fit
of
passion
had
told
her
he
would
sooner
die
than
acknowledge
her
as
his
wife
there
would
be
a
great
party
at
the
red
house
on
new
year
eve
she
knew
her
husband
would
be
smiling
and
smiled
upon
hiding
existence
in
the
darkest
corner
of
his
heart
but
she
would
mar
his
pleasure
she
would
go
in
her
dingy
rags
with
her
faded
face
once
as
handsome
as
the
best
with
her
little
child
that
had
its
father
hair
and
eyes
and
disclose
herself
to
the
squire
as
his
eldest
son
wife
it
is
seldom
that
the
miserable
can
help
regarding
their
misery
as
a
wrong
inflicted
by
those
who
are
less
miserable
molly
knew
that
the
cause
of
her
dingy
rags
was
not
her
husband
neglect
but
the
demon
opium
to
whom
she
was
enslaved
body
and
soul
except
in
the
lingering
mother
tenderness
that
refused
to
give
him
her
hungry
child
she
knew
this
well
and
yet
in
the
moments
of
wretched
unbenumbed
consciousness
the
sense
of
her
want
and
degradation
transformed
itself
continually
into
bitterness
towards
godfrey
was
well
off
and
if
she
had
her
rights
she
would
be
well
off
too
the
belief
that
he
repented
his
marriage
and
suffered
from
it
only
aggravated
her
vindictiveness
just
and
thoughts
do
not
come
to
us
too
thickly
even
in
the
purest
air
and
with
the
best
lessons
of
heaven
and
earth
how
should
those
delicate
messengers
make
their
way
to
molly
poisoned
chamber
inhabited
by
no
higher
memories
than
those
of
a
barmaid
paradise
of
pink
ribbons
and
gentlemen
jokes
she
had
set
out
at
an
early
hour
but
had
lingered
on
the
road
inclined
by
her
indolence
to
believe
that
if
she
waited
under
a
warm
shed
the
snow
would
cease
to
fall
she
had
waited
longer
than
she
knew
and
now
that
she
found
herself
belated
in
the
ruggedness
of
the
long
lanes
even
the
animation
of
a
vindictive
purpose
could
not
keep
her
spirit
from
failing
it
was
seven
and
by
this
time
she
was
not
very
far
from
raveloe
but
she
was
not
familiar
enough
with
those
monotonous
lanes
to
know
how
near
she
was
to
her
journey
end
she
needed
comfort
and
she
knew
but
one
comforter
the
familiar
demon
in
her
bosom
but
she
hesitated
a
moment
after
drawing
out
the
black
remnant
before
she
raised
it
to
her
lips
in
that
moment
the
mother
love
pleaded
for
painful
consciousness
rather
than
oblivion
pleaded
to
be
left
in
aching
weariness
rather
than
to
have
the
encircling
arms
benumbed
so
that
they
could
not
feel
the
dear
burden
in
another
moment
molly
had
flung
something
away
but
it
was
not
the
black
remnant
it
was
an
empty
phial
and
she
walked
on
again
under
the
breaking
cloud
from
which
there
came
now
and
then
the
light
of
a
quickly
veiled
star
for
a
freezing
wind
had
sprung
up
since
the
snowing
had
ceased
but
she
walked
always
more
and
more
drowsily
and
clutched
more
and
more
automatically
the
sleeping
child
at
her
bosom
slowly
the
demon
was
working
his
will
and
cold
and
weariness
were
his
helpers
soon
she
felt
nothing
but
a
supreme
immediate
longing
that
curtained
off
all
futurity
the
longing
to
lie
down
and
sleep
she
had
arrived
at
a
spot
where
her
footsteps
were
no
longer
checked
by
a
hedgerow
and
she
had
wandered
vaguely
unable
to
distinguish
any
objects
notwithstanding
the
wide
whiteness
around
her
and
the
growing
starlight
she
sank
down
against
a
straggling
furze
bush
an
easy
pillow
enough
and
the
bed
of
snow
too
was
soft
she
did
not
feel
that
the
bed
was
cold
and
did
not
heed
whether
the
child
would
wake
and
cry
for
her
but
her
arms
had
not
yet
relaxed
their
instinctive
clutch
and
the
little
one
slumbered
on
as
gently
as
if
it
had
been
rocked
in
a
cradle
but
the
complete
torpor
came
at
last
the
fingers
lost
their
tension
the
arms
unbent
then
the
little
head
fell
away
from
the
bosom
and
the
blue
eyes
opened
wide
on
the
cold
starlight
at
first
there
was
a
little
peevish
cry
of
mammy
and
an
effort
to
regain
the
pillowing
arm
and
bosom
but
mammy
ear
was
deaf
and
the
pillow
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
backward
suddenly
as
the
child
rolled
downward
on
its
mother
knees
all
wet
with
snow
its
eyes
were
caught
by
a
bright
glancing
light
on
the
white
ground
and
with
the
ready
transition
of
infancy
it
was
immediately
absorbed
in
watching
the
bright
living
thing
running
towards
it
yet
never
arriving
that
bright
living
thing
must
be
caught
and
in
an
instant
the
child
had
slipped
on
and
held
out
one
little
hand
to
catch
the
gleam
but
the
gleam
would
not
be
caught
in
that
way
and
now
the
head
was
held
up
to
see
where
the
cunning
gleam
came
from
it
came
from
a
very
bright
place
and
the
little
one
rising
on
its
legs
toddled
through
the
snow
the
old
grimy
shawl
in
which
it
was
wrapped
trailing
behind
it
and
the
queer
little
bonnet
dangling
at
its
back
toddled
on
to
the
open
door
of
silas
marner
cottage
and
right
up
to
the
warm
hearth
where
there
was
a
bright
fire
of
logs
and
sticks
which
had
thoroughly
warmed
the
old
sack
silas
greatcoat
spread
out
on
the
bricks
to
dry
the
little
one
accustomed
to
be
left
to
itself
for
long
hours
without
notice
from
its
mother
squatted
down
on
the
sack
and
spread
its
tiny
hands
towards
the
blaze
in
perfect
contentment
gurgling
and
making
many
inarticulate
communications
to
the
cheerful
fire
like
a
gosling
beginning
to
find
itself
comfortable
but
presently
the
warmth
had
a
lulling
effect
and
the
little
golden
head
sank
down
on
the
old
sack
and
the
blue
eyes
were
veiled
by
their
delicate
lids
but
where
was
silas
marner
while
this
strange
visitor
had
come
to
his
hearth
he
was
in
the
cottage
but
he
did
not
see
the
child
during
the
last
few
weeks
since
he
had
lost
his
money
he
had
contracted
the
habit
of
opening
his
door
and
looking
out
from
time
to
time
as
if
he
thought
that
his
money
might
be
somehow
coming
back
to
him
or
that
some
trace
some
news
of
it
might
be
mysteriously
on
the
road
and
be
caught
by
the
listening
ear
or
the
straining
eye
it
was
chiefly
at
night
when
he
was
not
occupied
in
his
loom
that
he
fell
into
this
repetition
of
an
act
for
which
he
could
have
assigned
no
definite
purpose
and
which
can
hardly
be
understood
except
by
those
who
have
undergone
a
bewildering
separation
from
a
supremely
loved
object
in
the
evening
twilight
and
later
whenever
the
night
was
not
dark
silas
looked
out
on
that
narrow
prospect
round
the
listening
and
gazing
not
with
hope
but
with
mere
yearning
and
unrest
this
morning
he
had
been
told
by
some
of
his
neighbours
that
it
was
new
year
eve
and
that
he
must
sit
up
and
hear
the
old
year
rung
out
and
the
new
rung
in
because
that
was
good
luck
and
might
bring
his
money
back
again
this
was
only
a
friendly
of
jesting
with
the
oddities
of
a
miser
but
it
had
perhaps
helped
to
throw
silas
into
a
more
than
usually
excited
state
since
the
of
twilight
he
had
opened
his
door
again
and
again
though
only
to
shut
it
immediately
at
seeing
all
distance
veiled
by
the
falling
snow
but
the
last
time
he
opened
it
the
snow
had
ceased
and
the
clouds
were
parting
here
and
there
he
stood
and
listened
and
gazed
for
a
long
while
there
was
really
something
on
the
road
coming
towards
him
then
but
he
caught
no
sign
of
it
and
the
stillness
and
the
wide
trackless
snow
seemed
to
narrow
his
solitude
and
touched
his
yearning
with
the
chill
of
despair
he
went
in
again
and
put
his
right
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
to
close
it
but
he
did
not
close
it
he
was
arrested
as
he
had
been
already
since
his
loss
by
the
invisible
wand
of
catalepsy
and
stood
like
a
graven
image
with
wide
but
sightless
eyes
holding
open
his
door
powerless
to
resist
either
the
good
or
the
evil
that
might
enter
there
when
marner
sensibility
returned
he
continued
the
action
which
had
been
arrested
and
closed
his
door
unaware
of
the
chasm
in
his
consciousness
unaware
of
any
intermediate
change
except
that
the
light
had
grown
dim
and
that
he
was
chilled
and
faint
he
thought
he
had
been
too
long
standing
at
the
door
and
looking
out
turning
towards
the
hearth
where
the
two
logs
had
fallen
apart
and
sent
forth
only
a
red
uncertain
glimmer
he
seated
himself
on
his
fireside
chair
and
was
stooping
to
push
his
logs
together
when
to
his
blurred
vision
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
gold
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
hearth
gold
his
own
gold
brought
back
to
him
as
mysteriously
as
it
had
been
taken
away
he
felt
his
heart
begin
to
beat
violently
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
unable
to
stretch
out
his
hand
and
grasp
the
restored
treasure
the
heap
of
gold
seemed
to
glow
and
get
larger
beneath
his
agitated
gaze
he
leaned
forward
at
last
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
but
instead
of
the
hard
coin
with
the
familiar
resisting
outline
his
fingers
encountered
soft
warm
curls
in
utter
amazement
silas
fell
on
his
knees
and
bent
his
head
low
to
examine
the
marvel
it
was
a
sleeping
child
a
round
fair
thing
with
soft
yellow
rings
all
over
its
head
could
this
be
his
little
sister
come
back
to
him
in
a
dream
his
little
sister
whom
he
had
carried
about
in
his
arms
for
a
year
before
she
died
when
he
was
a
small
boy
without
shoes
or
stockings
that
was
the
first
thought
that
darted
across
silas
blank
wonderment
it
a
dream
he
rose
to
his
feet
again
pushed
his
logs
together
and
throwing
on
some
dried
leaves
and
sticks
raised
a
flame
but
the
flame
did
not
disperse
the
vision
it
only
lit
up
more
distinctly
the
little
round
form
of
the
child
and
its
shabby
clothing
it
was
very
much
like
his
little
sister
silas
sank
into
his
chair
powerless
under
the
double
presence
of
an
inexplicable
surprise
and
a
hurrying
influx
of
memories
how
and
when
had
the
child
come
in
without
his
knowledge
he
had
never
been
beyond
the
door
but
along
with
that
question
and
almost
thrusting
it
away
there
was
a
vision
of
the
old
home
and
the
old
streets
leading
to
lantern
yard
and
within
that
vision
another
of
the
thoughts
which
had
been
present
with
him
in
those
scenes
the
thoughts
were
strange
to
him
now
like
old
friendships
impossible
to
revive
and
yet
he
had
a
dreamy
feeling
that
this
child
was
somehow
a
message
come
to
him
from
that
life
it
stirred
fibres
that
had
never
been
moved
in
raveloe
old
quiverings
of
tenderness
old
impressions
of
awe
at
the
presentiment
of
some
power
presiding
over
his
life
for
his
imagination
had
not
yet
extricated
itself
from
the
sense
of
mystery
in
the
child
sudden
presence
and
had
formed
no
conjectures
of
ordinary
natural
means
by
which
the
event
could
have
been
brought
about
but
there
was
a
cry
on
the
hearth
the
child
had
awaked
and
marner
stooped
to
lift
it
on
his
knee
it
clung
round
his
neck
and
burst
louder
and
louder
into
that
mingling
of
inarticulate
cries
with
mammy
by
which
little
children
express
the
bewilderment
of
waking
silas
pressed
it
to
him
and
almost
unconsciously
uttered
sounds
of
hushing
tenderness
while
he
bethought
himself
that
some
of
his
porridge
which
had
got
cool
by
the
dying
fire
would
do
to
feed
the
child
with
if
it
were
only
warmed
up
a
little
he
had
plenty
to
do
through
the
next
hour
the
porridge
sweetened
with
some
dry
brown
sugar
from
an
old
store
which
he
had
refrained
from
using
for
himself
stopped
the
cries
of
the
little
one
and
made
her
lift
her
blue
eyes
with
a
wide
quiet
gaze
at
silas
as
he
put
the
spoon
into
her
mouth
presently
she
slipped
from
his
knee
and
began
to
toddle
about
but
with
a
pretty
stagger
that
made
silas
jump
up
and
follow
her
lest
she
should
fall
against
anything
that
would
hurt
her
but
she
only
fell
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
ground
and
began
to
pull
at
her
boots
looking
up
at
him
with
a
crying
face
as
if
the
boots
hurt
her
he
took
her
on
his
knee
again
but
it
was
some
time
before
it
occurred
to
silas
dull
bachelor
mind
that
the
wet
boots
were
the
grievance
pressing
on
her
warm
ankles
he
got
them
off
with
difficulty
and
baby
was
at
once
happily
occupied
with
the
primary
mystery
of
her
own
toes
inviting
silas
with
much
chuckling
to
consider
the
mystery
too
but
the
wet
boots
had
at
last
suggested
to
silas
that
the
child
had
been
walking
on
the
snow
and
this
roused
him
from
his
entire
oblivion
of
any
ordinary
means
by
which
it
could
have
entered
or
been
brought
into
his
house
under
the
prompting
of
this
new
idea
and
without
waiting
to
form
conjectures
he
raised
the
child
in
his
arms
and
went
to
the
door
as
soon
as
he
had
opened
it
there
was
the
cry
of
mammy
again
which
silas
had
not
heard
since
the
child
first
hungry
waking
bending
forward
he
could
just
discern
the
marks
made
by
the
little
feet
on
the
virgin
snow
and
he
followed
their
track
to
the
furze
bushes
mammy
the
little
one
cried
again
and
again
stretching
itself
forward
so
as
almost
to
escape
from
silas
arms
before
he
himself
was
aware
that
there
was
something
more
than
the
bush
before
him
that
there
was
a
human
body
with
the
head
sunk
low
in
the
furze
and
with
the
shaken
snow
chapter
xiii
it
was
after
the
early
at
the
red
house
and
the
entertainment
was
in
that
stage
when
bashfulness
itself
had
passed
into
easy
jollity
when
gentlemen
conscious
of
unusual
accomplishments
could
at
length
be
prevailed
on
to
dance
a
hornpipe
and
when
the
squire
preferred
talking
loudly
scattering
snuff
and
patting
his
visitors
backs
to
sitting
longer
at
the
a
choice
exasperating
to
uncle
kimble
who
being
always
volatile
in
sober
business
hours
became
intense
and
bitter
over
cards
and
brandy
shuffled
before
his
adversary
deal
with
a
glare
of
suspicion
and
turned
up
a
mean
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
disgust
as
if
in
a
world
where
such
things
could
happen
one
might
as
well
enter
on
a
course
of
reckless
profligacy
when
the
evening
had
advanced
to
this
pitch
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
it
was
usual
for
the
servants
the
heavy
duties
of
supper
being
well
over
to
get
their
share
of
amusement
by
coming
to
look
on
at
the
dancing
so
that
the
back
regions
of
the
house
were
left
in
solitude
there
were
two
doors
by
which
the
white
parlour
was
entered
from
the
hall
and
they
were
both
standing
open
for
the
sake
of
air
but
the
lower
one
was
crowded
with
the
servants
and
villagers
and
only
the
upper
doorway
was
left
free
bob
cass
was
figuring
in
a
hornpipe
and
his
father
very
proud
of
this
lithe
son
whom
he
repeatedly
declared
to
be
just
like
himself
in
his
young
days
in
a
tone
that
implied
this
to
be
the
very
highest
stamp
of
juvenile
merit
was
the
centre
of
a
group
who
had
placed
themselves
opposite
the
performer
not
far
from
the
upper
door
godfrey
was
standing
a
little
way
off
not
to
admire
his
brother
dancing
but
to
keep
sight
of
nancy
who
was
seated
in
the
group
near
her
father
he
stood
aloof
because
he
wished
to
avoid
suggesting
himself
as
a
subject
for
the
squire
fatherly
jokes
in
connection
with
matrimony
and
miss
nancy
lammeter
beauty
which
were
likely
to
become
more
and
more
explicit
but
he
had
the
prospect
of
dancing
with
her
again
when
the
hornpipe
was
concluded
and
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
very
pleasant
to
get
long
glances
at
her
quite
unobserved
but
when
godfrey
was
lifting
his
eyes
from
one
of
those
long
glances
they
encountered
an
object
as
startling
to
him
at
that
moment
as
if
it
had
been
an
apparition
from
the
dead
it
an
apparition
from
that
hidden
life
which
lies
like
a
dark
behind
the
goodly
ornamented
facade
that
meets
the
sunlight
and
the
gaze
of
respectable
admirers
it
was
his
own
child
carried
in
silas
marner
arms
that
was
his
instantaneous
impression
unaccompanied
by
doubt
though
he
had
not
seen
the
child
for
months
past
and
when
the
hope
was
rising
that
he
might
possibly
be
mistaken
crackenthorp
and
lammeter
had
already
advanced
to
silas
in
astonishment
at
this
strange
advent
godfrey
joined
them
immediately
unable
to
rest
without
hearing
every
word
trying
to
control
himself
but
conscious
that
if
any
one
noticed
him
they
must
see
that
he
was
and
trembling
but
now
all
eyes
at
that
end
of
the
room
were
bent
on
silas
marner
the
squire
himself
had
risen
and
asked
angrily
how
this
this
what
do
you
do
coming
in
here
in
this
way
i
come
for
the
doctor
i
want
the
doctor
silas
had
said
in
the
first
moment
to
crackenthorp
why
what
the
matter
marner
said
the
rector
the
here
but
say
quietly
what
you
want
him
for
it
a
woman
said
silas
speaking
low
and
just
as
godfrey
came
up
she
dead
i
think
dead
in
the
snow
at
the
not
far
from
my
door
godfrey
felt
a
great
throb
there
was
one
terror
in
his
mind
at
that
moment
it
was
that
the
woman
might
be
dead
that
was
an
evil
terror
an
ugly
inmate
to
have
found
a
in
kindly
disposition
but
no
disposition
is
a
security
from
evil
wishes
to
a
man
whose
happiness
hangs
on
duplicity
hush
hush
said
crackenthorp
go
out
into
the
hall
there
i
fetch
the
doctor
to
you
found
a
woman
in
the
snow
and
thinks
she
dead
he
added
speaking
low
to
the
squire
better
say
as
little
about
it
as
possible
it
will
shock
the
ladies
just
tell
them
a
poor
woman
is
ill
from
cold
and
hunger
i
go
and
fetch
kimble
by
this
time
however
the
ladies
had
pressed
forward
curious
to
know
what
could
have
brought
the
solitary
there
under
such
strange
circumstances
and
interested
in
the
pretty
child
who
half
alarmed
and
half
attracted
by
the
brightness
and
the
numerous
company
now
frowned
and
hid
her
face
now
lifted
up
her
head
again
and
looked
round
placably
until
a
touch
or
a
coaxing
word
brought
back
the
frown
and
made
her
bury
her
face
with
new
determination
what
child
is
it
said
several
ladies
at
once
and
among
the
rest
nancy
lammeter
addressing
godfrey
i
do
know
some
poor
woman
who
has
been
found
in
the
snow
i
believe
was
the
answer
godfrey
wrung
from
himself
with
a
terrible
effort
after
all
i
certain
he
hastened
to
add
silently
in
anticipation
of
his
own
conscience
why
you
better
leave
the
child
here
then
master
marner
said
kimble
hesitating
however
to
take
those
dingy
clothes
into
contact
with
her
own
ornamented
satin
bodice
i
tell
one
o
the
girls
to
fetch
it
no
no
i
ca
part
with
it
i
ca
let
it
go
said
silas
abruptly
it
come
to
me
i
a
right
to
keep
it
the
proposition
to
take
the
child
from
him
had
come
to
silas
quite
unexpectedly
and
his
speech
uttered
under
a
strong
sudden
impulse
was
almost
like
a
revelation
to
himself
a
minute
before
he
had
no
distinct
intention
about
the
child
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
said
kimble
in
mild
surprise
to
her
neighbour
now
ladies
i
must
trouble
you
to
stand
aside
said
kimble
coming
from
the
in
some
bitterness
at
the
interruption
but
drilled
by
the
long
habit
of
his
profession
into
obedience
to
unpleasant
calls
even
when
he
was
hardly
sober
it
a
nasty
business
turning
out
now
eh
kimble
said
the
squire
he
might
ha
gone
for
your
young
fellow
the
there
his
name
might
aye
what
the
use
of
talking
about
might
growled
uncle
kimble
hastening
out
with
marner
and
followed
by
crackenthorp
and
godfrey
get
me
a
pair
of
thick
boots
godfrey
will
you
and
stay
let
somebody
run
to
winthrop
and
fetch
dolly
she
the
best
woman
to
get
ben
was
here
himself
before
supper
is
he
gone
yes
sir
i
met
him
said
marner
but
i
could
stop
to
tell
him
anything
only
i
said
i
was
going
for
the
doctor
and
he
said
the
doctor
was
at
the
squire
and
i
made
haste
and
ran
and
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
at
the
back
o
the
house
and
so
i
went
in
to
where
the
company
was
the
child
no
longer
distracted
by
the
bright
light
and
the
smiling
women
faces
began
to
cry
and
call
for
mammy
though
always
clinging
to
marner
who
had
apparently
won
her
thorough
confidence
godfrey
had
come
back
with
the
boots
and
felt
the
cry
as
if
some
fibre
were
drawn
tight
within
him
i
go
he
said
hastily
eager
for
some
movement
i
go
and
fetch
the
woman
mrs
winthrop
oh
pooh
send
somebody
else
said
uncle
kimble
hurrying
away
with
marner
you
let
me
know
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
kimble
said
crackenthorp
but
the
doctor
was
out
of
hearing
godfrey
too
had
disappeared
he
was
gone
to
snatch
his
hat
and
coat
having
just
reflection
enough
to
remember
that
he
must
not
look
like
a
madman
but
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
into
the
snow
without
heeding
his
thin
shoes
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
on
his
rapid
way
to
the
by
the
side
of
dolly
who
though
feeling
that
she
was
entirely
in
her
place
in
encountering
cold
and
snow
on
an
errand
of
mercy
was
much
concerned
at
a
young
gentleman
getting
his
feet
wet
under
a
like
impulse
you
a
deal
better
go
back
sir
said
dolly
with
respectful
compassion
you
no
call
to
catch
cold
and
i
ask
you
if
you
be
so
good
as
tell
my
husband
to
come
on
your
way
back
he
at
the
rainbow
i
doubt
if
you
found
him
anyway
sober
enough
to
be
o
use
or
else
there
snell
happen
send
the
boy
up
to
fetch
and
carry
for
there
may
be
things
wanted
from
the
doctor
no
i
stay
now
i
once
out
i
stay
outside
here
said
godfrey
when
they
came
opposite
marner
cottage
you
can
come
and
tell
me
if
i
can
do
anything
well
sir
you
very
good
you
a
tender
heart
said
dolly
going
to
the
door
godfrey
was
too
painfully
preoccupied
to
feel
a
twinge
of
at
this
undeserved
praise
he
walked
up
and
down
unconscious
that
he
was
plunging
in
snow
unconscious
of
everything
but
trembling
suspense
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
cottage
and
the
effect
of
each
alternative
on
his
future
lot
no
not
quite
unconscious
of
everything
else
deeper
down
and
by
passionate
desire
and
dread
there
was
the
sense
that
he
ought
not
to
be
waiting
on
these
alternatives
that
he
ought
to
accept
the
consequences
of
his
deeds
own
the
miserable
wife
and
fulfil
the
claims
of
the
helpless
child
but
he
had
not
moral
courage
enough
to
contemplate
that
active
renunciation
of
nancy
as
possible
for
him
he
had
only
conscience
and
heart
enough
to
make
him
for
ever
uneasy
under
the
weakness
that
forbade
the
renunciation
and
at
this
moment
his
mind
leaped
away
from
all
restraint
toward
the
sudden
prospect
of
deliverance
from
his
long
bondage
is
she
dead
said
the
voice
that
predominated
over
every
other
within
him
if
she
is
i
may
marry
nancy
and
then
i
shall
be
a
good
fellow
in
future
and
have
no
secrets
and
the
child
shall
be
taken
care
of
somehow
but
across
that
vision
came
the
other
possibility
she
may
live
and
then
it
all
up
with
me
godfrey
never
knew
how
long
it
was
before
the
door
of
the
cottage
opened
and
kimble
came
out
he
went
forward
to
meet
his
uncle
prepared
to
suppress
the
agitation
he
must
feel
whatever
news
he
was
to
hear
i
waited
for
you
as
i
come
so
far
he
said
speaking
first
pooh
it
was
nonsense
for
you
to
come
out
why
did
you
send
one
of
the
men
there
nothing
to
be
done
she
dead
has
been
dead
for
hours
i
should
say
what
sort
of
woman
is
she
said
godfrey
feeling
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
a
young
woman
but
emaciated
with
long
black
hair
some
vagrant
quite
in
rags
she
got
a
on
however
they
must
fetch
her
away
to
the
workhouse
come
come
along
i
want
to
look
at
her
said
godfrey
i
think
i
saw
such
a
woman
yesterday
i
overtake
you
in
a
minute
or
two
kimble
went
on
and
godfrey
turned
back
to
the
cottage
he
cast
only
one
glance
at
the
dead
face
on
the
pillow
which
dolly
had
smoothed
with
decent
care
but
he
remembered
that
last
look
at
his
unhappy
hated
wife
so
well
that
at
the
end
of
sixteen
years
every
line
in
the
worn
face
was
present
to
him
when
he
told
the
full
story
of
this
night
he
turned
immediately
towards
the
hearth
where
silas
marner
sat
lulling
the
child
she
was
perfectly
quiet
now
but
not
asleep
only
soothed
by
sweet
porridge
and
warmth
into
that
calm
which
makes
us
older
human
beings
with
our
inward
turmoil
feel
a
certain
awe
in
the
presence
of
a
little
child
such
as
we
feel
before
some
quiet
majesty
or
beauty
in
the
earth
or
sky
before
a
steady
glowing
planet
or
a
eglantine
or
the
bending
trees
over
a
silent
pathway
the
blue
eyes
looked
up
at
godfrey
without
any
uneasiness
or
sign
of
recognition
the
child
could
make
no
visible
audible
claim
on
its
father
and
the
father
felt
a
strange
mixture
of
feelings
a
conflict
of
regret
and
joy
that
the
pulse
of
that
little
heart
had
no
response
for
the
yearning
in
his
own
when
the
blue
eyes
turned
away
from
him
slowly
and
fixed
themselves
on
the
weaver
queer
face
which
was
bent
low
down
to
look
at
them
while
the
small
hand
began
to
pull
marner
withered
cheek
with
loving
disfiguration
you
take
the
child
to
the
parish
asked
godfrey
speaking
as
indifferently
as
he
could
who
says
so
said
marner
sharply
will
they
make
me
take
her
why
you
would
like
to
keep
her
should
you
an
old
bachelor
like
you
till
anybody
shows
they
a
right
to
take
her
away
from
me
said
marner
the
mother
dead
and
i
reckon
it
got
no
father
it
a
lone
thing
and
i
a
lone
thing
my
money
gone
i
do
know
where
and
this
is
come
from
i
do
know
where
i
know
nothing
partly
mazed
poor
little
thing
said
godfrey
let
me
give
something
towards
finding
it
clothes
he
had
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
found
and
thrusting
it
into
silas
hand
he
hurried
out
of
the
cottage
to
overtake
kimble
ah
i
see
it
not
the
same
woman
i
saw
he
said
as
he
came
up
it
a
pretty
little
child
the
old
fellow
seems
to
want
to
keep
it
that
strange
for
a
miser
like
him
but
i
gave
him
a
trifle
to
help
him
out
the
parish
is
likely
to
quarrel
with
him
for
the
right
to
keep
the
child
no
but
i
seen
the
time
when
i
might
have
quarrelled
with
him
for
it
myself
it
too
late
now
though
if
the
child
ran
into
the
fire
your
aunt
too
fat
to
overtake
it
she
could
only
sit
and
grunt
like
an
alarmed
sow
but
what
a
fool
you
are
godfrey
to
come
out
in
your
dancing
shoes
and
stockings
in
this
way
and
you
one
of
the
beaux
of
the
evening
and
at
your
own
house
what
do
you
mean
by
such
freaks
young
fellow
has
miss
nancy
been
cruel
and
do
you
want
to
spite
her
by
spoiling
your
pumps
oh
everything
has
been
disagreeable
i
was
tired
to
death
of
jigging
and
gallanting
and
that
bother
about
the
hornpipes
and
i
got
to
dance
with
the
other
miss
gunn
said
godfrey
glad
of
the
subterfuge
his
uncle
had
suggested
to
him
the
prevarication
and
white
lies
which
a
mind
that
keeps
itself
ambitiously
pure
is
as
uneasy
under
as
a
great
artist
under
the
false
touches
that
no
eye
detects
but
his
own
are
worn
as
lightly
as
mere
trimmings
when
once
the
actions
have
become
a
lie
godfrey
reappeared
in
the
white
parlour
with
dry
feet
and
since
the
truth
must
be
told
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
gladness
that
was
too
strong
for
painful
thoughts
to
struggle
with
for
could
he
not
venture
now
whenever
opportunity
offered
to
say
the
tenderest
things
to
nancy
lammeter
to
promise
her
and
himself
that
he
would
always
be
just
what
she
would
desire
to
see
him
there
was
no
danger
that
his
dead
wife
would
be
recognized
those
were
not
days
of
active
inquiry
and
wide
report
and
as
for
the
registry
of
their
marriage
that
was
a
long
way
off
buried
in
unturned
pages
away
from
every
one
interest
but
his
own
dunsey
might
betray
him
if
he
came
back
but
dunsey
might
be
won
to
silence
and
when
events
turn
out
so
much
better
for
a
man
than
he
has
had
reason
to
dread
is
it
not
a
proof
that
his
conduct
has
been
less
foolish
and
blameworthy
than
it
might
otherwise
have
appeared
when
we
are
treated
well
we
naturally
begin
to
think
that
we
are
not
altogether
unmeritorious
and
that
it
is
only
just
we
should
treat
ourselves
well
and
not
mar
our
own
good
fortune
where
after
all
would
be
the
use
of
his
confessing
the
past
to
nancy
lammeter
and
throwing
away
his
happiness
nay
hers
for
he
felt
some
confidence
that
she
loved
him
as
for
the
child
he
would
see
that
it
was
cared
for
he
would
never
forsake
it
he
would
do
everything
but
own
it
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
happy
in
life
without
being
owned
by
its
father
seeing
that
nobody
could
tell
how
things
would
turn
out
and
that
is
there
any
other
reason
wanted
well
then
that
the
father
would
be
much
happier
without
owning
the
child
chapter
xiv
there
was
a
pauper
burial
that
week
in
raveloe
and
up
kench
yard
at
batherley
it
was
known
that
the
woman
with
the
fair
child
who
had
lately
come
to
lodge
there
was
gone
away
again
that
was
all
the
express
note
taken
that
molly
had
disappeared
from
the
eyes
of
men
but
the
unwept
death
which
to
the
general
lot
seemed
as
trivial
as
the
leaf
was
charged
with
the
force
of
destiny
to
certain
human
lives
that
we
know
of
shaping
their
joys
and
sorrows
even
to
the
end
silas
marner
determination
to
keep
the
tramp
child
was
matter
of
hardly
less
surprise
and
iterated
talk
in
the
village
than
the
robbery
of
his
money
that
softening
of
feeling
towards
him
which
dated
from
his
misfortune
that
merging
of
suspicion
and
dislike
in
a
rather
contemptuous
pity
for
him
as
lone
and
crazy
was
now
accompanied
with
a
more
active
sympathy
especially
amongst
the
women
notable
mothers
who
knew
what
it
was
to
keep
children
whole
and
sweet
lazy
mothers
who
knew
what
it
was
to
be
interrupted
in
folding
their
arms
and
scratching
their
elbows
by
the
mischievous
propensities
of
children
just
firm
on
their
legs
were
equally
interested
in
conjecturing
how
a
lone
man
would
manage
with
a
child
on
his
hands
and
were
equally
ready
with
their
suggestions
the
notable
chiefly
telling
him
what
he
had
better
do
and
the
lazy
ones
being
emphatic
in
telling
him
what
he
would
never
be
able
to
do
among
the
notable
mothers
dolly
winthrop
was
the
one
whose
neighbourly
offices
were
the
most
acceptable
to
marner
for
they
were
rendered
without
any
show
of
bustling
instruction
silas
had
shown
her
the
given
to
him
by
godfrey
and
had
asked
her
what
he
should
do
about
getting
some
clothes
for
the
child
eh
master
marner
said
dolly
there
no
call
to
buy
no
more
nor
a
pair
o
shoes
for
i
got
the
little
petticoats
as
aaron
wore
five
years
ago
and
it
ill
spending
the
money
on
them
for
the
child
grow
like
grass
i
may
bless
it
that
it
will
and
the
same
day
dolly
brought
her
bundle
and
displayed
to
marner
one
by
one
the
tiny
garments
in
their
due
order
of
succession
most
of
them
patched
and
darned
but
clean
and
neat
as
herbs
this
was
the
introduction
to
a
great
ceremony
with
soap
and
water
from
which
baby
came
out
in
new
beauty
and
sat
on
dolly
knee
handling
her
toes
and
chuckling
and
patting
her
palms
together
with
an
air
of
having
made
several
discoveries
about
herself
which
she
communicated
by
alternate
sounds
of
and
mammy
the
mammy
was
not
a
cry
of
need
or
uneasiness
baby
had
been
used
to
utter
it
without
expecting
either
tender
sound
or
touch
to
follow
anybody
think
the
angils
in
heaven
could
be
prettier
said
dolly
rubbing
the
golden
curls
and
kissing
them
and
to
think
of
its
being
covered
wi
them
dirty
rags
and
the
poor
mother
froze
to
death
but
there
them
as
took
care
of
it
and
brought
it
to
your
door
master
marner
the
door
was
open
and
it
walked
in
over
the
snow
like
as
if
it
had
been
a
little
starved
robin
did
you
say
the
door
was
open
yes
said
silas
meditatively
yes
the
door
was
open
the
gone
i
do
know
where
and
this
is
come
from
i
do
know
where
he
had
not
mentioned
to
any
one
his
unconsciousness
of
the
entrance
shrinking
from
questions
which
might
lead
to
the
fact
he
himself
suspected
namely
that
he
had
been
in
one
of
his
trances
ah
said
dolly
with
soothing
gravity
it
like
the
night
and
the
morning
and
the
sleeping
and
the
waking
and
the
rain
and
the
harvest
one
goes
and
the
other
comes
and
we
know
nothing
how
nor
where
we
may
strive
and
scrat
and
fend
but
it
little
we
can
do
arter
all
the
big
things
come
and
go
wi
no
striving
o
they
do
that
they
do
and
i
think
you
in
the
right
on
it
to
keep
the
little
un
master
marner
seeing
as
it
been
sent
to
you
though
there
folks
as
thinks
different
you
happen
be
a
bit
moithered
with
it
while
it
so
little
but
i
come
and
welcome
and
see
to
it
for
you
i
a
bit
o
time
to
spare
most
days
for
when
one
gets
up
betimes
i
the
morning
the
clock
seems
to
stan
still
ten
afore
it
time
to
go
about
the
victual
so
as
i
say
i
come
and
see
to
the
child
for
you
and
welcome
thank
you
kindly
said
silas
hesitating
a
little
i
be
glad
if
you
tell
me
things
but
he
added
uneasily
leaning
forward
to
look
at
baby
with
some
jealousy
as
she
was
resting
her
head
backward
against
dolly
arm
and
eyeing
him
contentedly
from
a
distance
but
i
want
to
do
things
for
it
myself
else
it
may
get
fond
o
somebody
else
and
not
fond
o
me
i
been
used
to
fending
for
myself
in
the
house
i
can
learn
i
can
learn
eh
to
be
sure
said
dolly
gently
i
seen
men
as
are
wonderful
handy
wi
children
the
men
are
and
contrairy
mostly
god
help
but
when
the
drink
out
of
they
are
unsensible
though
they
bad
for
leeching
and
bandaging
so
fiery
and
unpatient
you
see
this
goes
first
next
the
skin
proceeded
dolly
taking
up
the
little
shirt
and
putting
it
on
yes
said
marner
docilely
bringing
his
eyes
very
close
that
they
might
be
initiated
in
the
mysteries
whereupon
baby
seized
his
head
with
both
her
small
arms
and
put
her
lips
against
his
face
with
purring
noises
see
there
said
dolly
with
a
woman
tender
tact
she
fondest
you
she
wants
to
go
o
your
lap
i
be
bound
go
then
take
her
master
marner
you
can
put
the
things
on
and
then
you
can
say
as
you
done
for
her
from
the
first
of
her
coming
to
you
marner
took
her
on
his
lap
trembling
with
an
emotion
mysterious
to
himself
at
something
unknown
dawning
on
his
life
thought
and
feeling
were
so
confused
within
him
that
if
he
had
tried
to
give
them
utterance
he
could
only
have
said
that
the
child
was
come
instead
of
the
gold
that
the
gold
had
turned
into
the
child
he
took
the
garments
from
dolly
and
put
them
on
under
her
teaching
interrupted
of
course
by
baby
gymnastics
there
then
why
you
take
to
it
quite
easy
master
marner
said
dolly
but
what
shall
you
do
when
you
forced
to
sit
in
your
loom
for
she
get
busier
and
mischievouser
every
day
she
will
bless
her
it
lucky
as
you
got
that
high
hearth
of
a
grate
for
that
keeps
the
fire
more
out
of
her
reach
but
if
you
got
anything
as
can
be
spilt
or
broke
or
as
is
fit
to
cut
her
fingers
off
she
be
at
it
and
it
is
but
right
you
should
know
silas
meditated
a
little
while
in
some
perplexity
i
tie
her
to
the
leg
o
the
loom
he
said
at
last
tie
her
with
a
good
long
strip
o
something
well
mayhap
that
do
as
it
a
little
gell
for
they
easier
persuaded
to
sit
i
one
place
nor
the
lads
i
know
what
the
lads
are
for
i
had
four
four
i
had
god
knows
and
if
you
was
to
take
and
tie
up
they
make
a
fighting
and
a
crying
as
if
you
was
ringing
the
pigs
but
i
bring
you
my
little
chair
and
some
bits
o
red
rag
and
things
for
her
to
play
wi
an
she
sit
and
chatter
to
as
if
they
was
alive
eh
if
it
was
a
sin
to
the
lads
to
wish
made
different
bless
i
should
ha
been
glad
for
one
of
to
be
a
little
gell
and
to
think
as
i
could
ha
taught
her
to
scour
and
mend
and
the
knitting
and
everything
but
i
can
teach
this
little
un
master
marner
when
she
gets
old
enough
but
she
be
little
un
said
marner
rather
hastily
she
be
nobody
else
no
to
be
sure
you
have
a
right
to
her
if
you
a
father
to
her
and
bring
her
up
according
but
added
dolly
coming
to
a
point
which
she
had
determined
beforehand
to
touch
upon
you
must
bring
her
up
like
christened
folks
children
and
take
her
to
church
and
let
her
learn
her
catechise
as
my
little
aaron
can
say
off
the
i
believe
and
everything
and
hurt
nobody
by
word
or
deed
as
well
as
if
he
was
the
clerk
that
what
you
must
do
master
marner
if
you
do
the
right
thing
by
the
orphin
child
marner
pale
face
flushed
suddenly
under
a
new
anxiety
his
mind
was
too
busy
trying
to
give
some
definite
bearing
to
dolly
words
for
him
to
think
of
answering
her
and
it
my
belief
she
went
on
as
the
poor
little
creatur
has
never
been
christened
and
it
nothing
but
right
as
the
parson
should
be
spoke
to
and
if
you
was
noways
unwilling
i
talk
to
macey
about
it
this
very
day
for
if
the
child
ever
went
anyways
wrong
and
you
had
done
your
part
by
it
master
marner
and
everything
to
save
it
from
harm
it
be
a
thorn
i
your
bed
for
ever
o
this
side
the
grave
and
i
ca
think
as
it
be
easy
lying
down
for
anybody
when
they
got
to
another
world
if
they
had
done
their
part
by
the
helpless
children
as
come
their
own
asking
dolly
herself
was
disposed
to
be
silent
for
some
time
now
for
she
had
spoken
from
the
depths
of
her
own
simple
belief
and
was
much
concerned
to
know
whether
her
words
would
produce
the
desired
effect
on
silas
he
was
puzzled
and
anxious
for
dolly
word
christened
conveyed
no
distinct
meaning
to
him
he
had
only
heard
of
baptism
and
had
only
seen
the
baptism
of
men
and
women
what
is
it
as
you
mean
by
christened
he
said
at
last
timidly
wo
folks
be
good
to
her
without
it
dear
dear
master
marner
said
dolly
with
gentle
distress
and
compassion
had
you
never
no
father
nor
mother
as
taught
you
to
say
your
prayers
and
as
there
good
words
and
good
things
to
keep
us
from
harm
yes
said
silas
in
a
low
voice
i
know
a
deal
about
that
used
to
used
to
but
your
ways
are
different
my
country
was
a
good
way
off
he
paused
a
few
moments
and
then
added
more
decidedly
but
i
want
to
do
everything
as
can
be
done
for
the
child
and
whatever
right
for
it
i
this
country
and
you
think
do
it
good
i
act
according
if
you
tell
me
well
then
master
marner
said
dolly
inwardly
rejoiced
i
ask
macey
to
speak
to
the
parson
about
it
and
you
must
fix
on
a
name
for
it
because
it
must
have
a
name
giv
it
when
it
christened
my
mother
name
was
hephzibah
said
silas
and
my
little
sister
was
named
after
her
eh
that
a
hard
name
said
dolly
i
partly
think
it
is
a
christened
name
it
a
bible
name
said
silas
old
ideas
recurring
then
i
no
call
to
speak
again
it
said
dolly
rather
startled
by
silas
knowledge
on
this
head
but
you
see
i
no
scholard
and
slow
at
catching
the
words
my
husband
says
i
allays
like
as
if
i
was
putting
the
haft
for
the
handle
that
what
he
says
for
he
very
sharp
god
help
him
but
it
was
calling
your
little
sister
by
such
a
hard
name
when
you
got
nothing
big
to
say
like
was
it
master
marner
we
called
her
eppie
said
silas
well
if
it
was
noways
wrong
to
shorten
the
name
it
be
a
deal
handier
and
so
i
go
now
master
marner
and
i
speak
about
the
christening
afore
dark
and
i
wish
you
the
best
o
luck
and
it
my
belief
as
it
come
to
you
if
you
do
what
right
by
the
orphin
child
and
there
the
to
be
seen
to
and
as
to
washing
its
bits
o
things
you
need
look
to
nobody
but
me
for
i
can
do
wi
one
hand
when
i
got
my
suds
about
eh
the
blessed
angil
you
let
me
bring
my
aaron
one
o
these
days
and
he
show
her
his
little
cart
as
his
father
made
for
him
and
the
pup
as
he
got
baby
christened
the
rector
deciding
that
a
double
baptism
was
the
lesser
risk
to
incur
and
on
this
occasion
silas
making
himself
as
clean
and
tidy
as
he
could
appeared
for
the
first
time
within
the
church
and
shared
in
the
observances
held
sacred
by
his
neighbours
he
was
quite
unable
by
means
of
anything
he
heard
or
saw
to
identify
the
raveloe
religion
with
his
old
faith
if
he
could
at
any
time
in
his
previous
life
have
done
so
it
must
have
been
by
the
aid
of
a
strong
feeling
ready
to
vibrate
with
sympathy
rather
than
by
a
comparison
of
phrases
and
ideas
and
now
for
long
years
that
feeling
had
been
dormant
he
had
no
distinct
idea
about
the
baptism
and
the
except
that
dolly
had
said
it
was
for
the
good
of
the
child
and
in
this
way
as
the
weeks
grew
to
months
the
child
created
fresh
and
fresh
links
between
his
life
and
the
lives
from
which
he
had
hitherto
shrunk
continually
into
narrower
isolation
unlike
the
gold
which
needed
nothing
and
must
be
worshipped
in
solitude
which
was
hidden
away
from
the
daylight
was
deaf
to
the
song
of
birds
and
started
to
no
human
tones
eppie
was
a
creature
of
endless
claims
and
desires
seeking
and
loving
sunshine
and
living
sounds
and
living
movements
making
trial
of
everything
with
trust
in
new
joy
and
stirring
the
human
kindness
in
all
eyes
that
looked
on
her
the
gold
had
kept
his
thoughts
in
an
circle
leading
to
nothing
beyond
itself
but
eppie
was
an
object
compacted
of
changes
and
hopes
that
forced
his
thoughts
onward
and
carried
them
far
away
from
their
old
eager
pacing
towards
the
same
blank
limit
carried
them
away
to
the
new
things
that
would
come
with
the
coming
years
when
eppie
would
have
learned
to
understand
how
her
father
silas
cared
for
her
and
made
him
look
for
images
of
that
time
in
the
ties
and
charities
that
bound
together
the
families
of
his
neighbours
the
gold
had
asked
that
he
should
sit
weaving
longer
and
longer
deafened
and
blinded
more
and
more
to
all
things
except
the
monotony
of
his
loom
and
the
repetition
of
his
web
but
eppie
called
him
away
from
his
weaving
and
made
him
think
all
its
pauses
a
holiday
reawakening
his
senses
with
her
fresh
life
even
to
the
old
that
came
crawling
forth
in
the
early
spring
sunshine
and
warming
him
into
joy
because
had
joy
and
when
the
sunshine
grew
strong
and
lasting
so
that
the
buttercups
were
thick
in
the
meadows
silas
might
be
seen
in
the
sunny
midday
or
in
the
late
afternoon
when
the
shadows
were
lengthening
under
the
hedgerows
strolling
out
with
uncovered
head
to
carry
eppie
beyond
the
to
where
the
flowers
grew
till
they
reached
some
favourite
bank
where
he
could
sit
down
while
eppie
toddled
to
pluck
the
flowers
and
make
remarks
to
the
winged
things
that
murmured
happily
above
the
bright
petals
calling
attention
continually
by
bringing
him
the
flowers
then
she
would
turn
her
ear
to
some
sudden
and
silas
learned
to
please
her
by
making
signs
of
hushed
stillness
that
they
might
listen
for
the
note
to
come
again
so
that
when
it
came
she
set
up
her
small
back
and
laughed
with
gurgling
triumph
sitting
on
the
banks
in
this
way
silas
began
to
look
for
the
once
familiar
herbs
again
and
as
the
leaves
with
their
unchanged
outline
and
markings
lay
on
his
palm
there
was
a
sense
of
crowding
remembrances
from
which
he
turned
away
timidly
taking
refuge
in
eppie
little
world
that
lay
lightly
on
his
enfeebled
spirit
as
the
child
mind
was
growing
into
knowledge
his
mind
was
growing
into
memory
as
her
life
unfolded
his
soul
long
stupefied
in
a
cold
narrow
prison
was
unfolding
too
and
trembling
gradually
into
full
consciousness
it
was
an
influence
which
must
gather
force
with
every
new
year
the
tones
that
stirred
silas
heart
grew
articulate
and
called
for
more
distinct
answers
shapes
and
sounds
grew
clearer
for
eppie
eyes
and
ears
and
there
was
more
that
was
imperatively
required
to
notice
and
account
for
also
by
the
time
eppie
was
three
years
old
she
developed
a
fine
capacity
for
mischief
and
for
devising
ingenious
ways
of
being
troublesome
which
found
much
exercise
not
only
for
silas
patience
but
for
his
watchfulness
and
penetration
sorely
was
poor
silas
puzzled
on
such
occasions
by
the
incompatible
demands
of
love
dolly
winthrop
told
him
that
punishment
was
good
for
eppie
and
that
as
for
rearing
a
child
without
making
it
tingle
a
little
in
soft
and
safe
places
now
and
then
it
was
not
to
be
done
to
be
sure
there
another
thing
you
might
do
master
marner
added
dolly
meditatively
you
might
shut
her
up
once
i
the
that
was
what
i
did
wi
aaron
for
i
was
that
silly
wi
the
youngest
lad
as
i
could
never
bear
to
smack
him
not
as
i
could
find
i
my
heart
to
let
him
stay
i
the
more
nor
a
minute
but
it
was
enough
to
colly
him
all
over
so
as
he
must
be
new
washed
and
dressed
and
it
was
as
good
as
a
rod
to
him
that
was
but
i
put
it
upo
your
conscience
master
marner
as
there
one
of
you
must
choose
ayther
smacking
or
the
else
she
get
so
masterful
there
be
no
holding
her
silas
was
impressed
with
the
melancholy
truth
of
this
last
remark
but
his
force
of
mind
failed
before
the
only
two
penal
methods
open
to
him
not
only
because
it
was
painful
to
him
to
hurt
eppie
but
because
he
trembled
at
a
moment
contention
with
her
lest
she
should
love
him
the
less
for
it
let
even
an
affectionate
goliath
get
himself
tied
to
a
small
tender
thing
dreading
to
hurt
it
by
pulling
and
dreading
still
more
to
snap
the
cord
and
which
of
the
two
pray
will
be
master
it
was
clear
that
eppie
with
her
short
toddling
steps
must
lead
father
silas
a
pretty
dance
on
any
fine
morning
when
circumstances
favoured
mischief
for
example
he
had
wisely
chosen
a
broad
strip
of
linen
as
a
means
of
fastening
her
to
his
loom
when
he
was
busy
it
made
a
broad
belt
round
her
waist
and
was
long
enough
to
allow
of
her
reaching
the
and
sitting
down
on
it
but
not
long
enough
for
her
to
attempt
any
dangerous
climbing
one
bright
summer
morning
silas
had
been
more
engrossed
than
usual
in
setting
up
a
new
piece
of
work
an
occasion
on
which
his
scissors
were
in
requisition
these
scissors
owing
to
an
especial
warning
of
dolly
had
been
kept
carefully
out
of
reach
but
the
click
of
them
had
had
a
peculiar
attraction
for
her
ear
and
watching
the
results
of
that
click
she
had
derived
the
philosophic
lesson
that
the
same
cause
would
produce
the
same
effect
silas
had
seated
himself
in
his
loom
and
the
noise
of
weaving
had
begun
but
he
had
left
his
scissors
on
a
ledge
which
eppie
arm
was
long
enough
to
reach
and
now
like
a
small
mouse
watching
her
opportunity
she
stole
quietly
from
her
corner
secured
the
scissors
and
toddled
to
the
bed
again
setting
up
her
back
as
a
mode
of
concealing
the
fact
she
had
a
distinct
intention
as
to
the
use
of
the
scissors
and
having
cut
the
linen
strip
in
a
jagged
but
effectual
manner
in
two
moments
she
had
run
out
at
the
open
door
where
the
sunshine
was
inviting
her
while
poor
silas
believed
her
to
be
a
better
child
than
usual
it
was
not
until
he
happened
to
need
his
scissors
that
the
terrible
fact
burst
upon
him
eppie
had
run
out
by
herself
had
perhaps
fallen
into
the
silas
shaken
by
the
worst
fear
that
could
have
befallen
him
rushed
out
calling
eppie
and
ran
eagerly
about
the
unenclosed
space
exploring
the
dry
cavities
into
which
she
might
have
fallen
and
then
gazing
with
questioning
dread
at
the
smooth
red
surface
of
the
water
the
cold
drops
stood
on
his
brow
how
long
had
she
been
out
there
was
one
hope
that
she
had
crept
through
the
stile
and
got
into
the
fields
where
he
habitually
took
her
to
stroll
but
the
grass
was
high
in
the
meadow
and
there
was
no
descrying
her
if
she
were
there
except
by
a
close
search
that
would
be
a
trespass
on
osgood
crop
still
that
misdemeanour
must
be
committed
and
poor
silas
after
peering
all
round
the
hedgerows
traversed
the
grass
beginning
with
perturbed
vision
to
see
eppie
behind
every
group
of
red
sorrel
and
to
see
her
moving
always
farther
off
as
he
approached
the
meadow
was
searched
in
vain
and
he
got
over
the
stile
into
the
next
field
looking
with
dying
hope
towards
a
small
pond
which
was
now
reduced
to
its
summer
shallowness
so
as
to
leave
a
wide
margin
of
good
adhesive
mud
here
however
sat
eppie
discoursing
cheerfully
to
her
own
small
boot
which
she
was
using
as
a
bucket
to
convey
the
water
into
a
deep
while
her
little
naked
foot
was
planted
comfortably
on
a
cushion
of
mud
a
calf
was
observing
her
with
alarmed
doubt
through
the
opposite
hedge
here
was
clearly
a
case
of
aberration
in
a
christened
child
which
demanded
severe
treatment
but
silas
overcome
with
convulsive
joy
at
finding
his
treasure
again
could
do
nothing
but
snatch
her
up
and
cover
her
with
kisses
it
was
not
until
he
had
carried
her
home
and
had
begun
to
think
of
the
necessary
washing
that
he
recollected
the
need
that
he
should
punish
eppie
and
make
her
remember
the
idea
that
she
might
run
away
again
and
come
to
harm
gave
him
unusual
resolution
and
for
the
first
time
he
determined
to
try
the
a
small
closet
near
the
hearth
naughty
naughty
eppie
he
suddenly
began
holding
her
on
his
knee
and
pointing
to
her
muddy
feet
and
clothes
naughty
to
cut
with
the
scissors
and
run
away
eppie
must
go
into
the
for
being
naughty
daddy
must
put
her
in
the
he
that
this
would
be
shock
enough
and
that
eppie
would
begin
to
cry
but
instead
of
that
she
began
to
shake
herself
on
his
knee
as
if
the
proposition
opened
a
pleasing
novelty
seeing
that
he
must
proceed
to
extremities
he
put
her
into
the
and
held
the
door
closed
with
a
trembling
sense
that
he
was
using
a
strong
measure
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
but
then
came
a
little
cry
opy
opy
and
silas
let
her
out
again
saying
now
eppie
never
be
naughty
again
else
she
must
go
in
the
a
black
naughty
place
the
weaving
must
stand
still
a
long
while
this
morning
for
now
eppie
must
be
washed
and
have
clean
clothes
on
but
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
this
punishment
would
have
a
lasting
effect
and
save
time
in
future
though
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
eppie
had
cried
more
in
half
an
hour
she
was
clean
again
and
silas
having
turned
his
back
to
see
what
he
could
do
with
the
linen
band
threw
it
down
again
with
the
reflection
that
eppie
would
be
good
without
fastening
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
he
turned
round
again
and
was
going
to
place
her
in
her
little
chair
near
the
loom
when
she
peeped
out
at
him
with
black
face
and
hands
again
and
said
eppie
in
de
this
total
failure
of
the
discipline
shook
silas
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
punishment
she
take
it
all
for
fun
he
observed
to
dolly
if
i
did
hurt
her
and
that
i
ca
do
winthrop
if
she
makes
me
a
bit
o
trouble
i
can
bear
it
and
she
got
no
tricks
but
what
she
grow
out
of
well
that
partly
true
master
marner
said
dolly
sympathetically
and
if
you
ca
bring
your
mind
to
frighten
her
off
touching
things
you
must
do
what
you
can
to
keep
out
of
her
way
that
what
i
do
wi
the
pups
as
the
lads
are
allays
they
worry
and
gnaw
worry
and
gnaw
they
will
if
it
was
one
sunday
cap
as
hung
anywhere
so
as
they
could
drag
it
they
know
no
difference
god
help
it
the
pushing
o
the
teeth
as
sets
on
that
what
it
is
so
eppie
was
reared
without
punishment
the
burden
of
her
misdeeds
being
borne
vicariously
by
father
silas
the
stone
hut
was
made
a
soft
nest
for
her
lined
with
downy
patience
and
also
in
the
world
that
lay
beyond
the
stone
hut
she
knew
nothing
of
frowns
and
denials
notwithstanding
the
difficulty
of
carrying
her
and
his
yarn
or
linen
at
the
same
time
silas
took
her
with
him
in
most
of
his
journeys
to
the
farmhouses
unwilling
to
leave
her
behind
at
dolly
winthrop
who
was
always
ready
to
take
care
of
her
and
little
eppie
the
weaver
child
became
an
object
of
interest
at
several
outlying
homesteads
as
well
as
in
the
village
hitherto
he
had
been
treated
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
a
useful
gnome
or
brownie
a
queer
and
unaccountable
creature
who
must
necessarily
be
looked
at
with
wondering
curiosity
and
repulsion
and
with
whom
one
would
be
glad
to
make
all
greetings
and
bargains
as
brief
as
possible
but
who
must
be
dealt
with
in
a
propitiatory
way
and
occasionally
have
a
present
of
pork
or
garden
stuff
to
carry
home
with
him
seeing
that
without
him
there
was
no
getting
the
yarn
woven
but
now
silas
met
with
open
smiling
faces
and
cheerful
questioning
as
a
person
whose
satisfactions
and
difficulties
could
be
understood
everywhere
he
must
sit
a
little
and
talk
about
the
child
and
words
of
interest
were
always
ready
for
him
ah
master
marner
you
be
lucky
if
she
takes
the
measles
soon
and
easy
or
why
there
is
many
lone
men
ha
been
wishing
to
take
up
with
a
little
un
like
that
but
i
reckon
the
weaving
makes
you
handier
than
men
as
do
work
you
partly
as
handy
as
a
woman
for
weaving
comes
next
to
spinning
elderly
masters
and
mistresses
seated
observantly
in
large
kitchen
shook
their
heads
over
the
difficulties
attendant
on
rearing
children
felt
round
arms
and
legs
and
pronounced
them
remarkably
firm
and
told
silas
that
if
she
turned
out
well
which
however
there
was
no
telling
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
him
to
have
a
steady
lass
to
do
for
him
when
he
got
helpless
servant
maidens
were
fond
of
carrying
her
out
to
look
at
the
hens
and
chickens
or
to
see
if
any
cherries
could
be
shaken
down
in
the
orchard
and
the
small
boys
and
girls
approached
her
slowly
with
cautious
movement
and
steady
gaze
like
little
dogs
face
to
face
with
one
of
their
own
kind
till
attraction
had
reached
the
point
at
which
the
soft
lips
were
put
out
for
a
kiss
no
child
was
afraid
of
approaching
silas
when
eppie
was
near
him
there
was
no
repulsion
around
him
now
either
for
young
or
old
for
the
little
child
had
come
to
link
him
once
more
with
the
whole
world
there
was
love
between
him
and
the
child
that
blent
them
into
one
and
there
was
love
between
the
child
and
the
world
from
men
and
women
with
parental
looks
and
tones
to
the
red
and
the
round
pebbles
silas
began
now
to
think
of
raveloe
life
entirely
in
relation
to
eppie
she
must
have
everything
that
was
a
good
in
raveloe
and
he
listened
docilely
that
he
might
come
to
understand
better
what
this
life
was
from
which
for
fifteen
years
he
had
stood
aloof
as
from
a
strange
thing
with
which
he
could
have
no
communion
as
some
man
who
has
a
precious
plant
to
which
he
would
give
a
nurturing
home
in
a
new
soil
thinks
of
the
rain
and
the
sunshine
and
all
influences
in
relation
to
his
nursling
and
asks
industriously
for
all
knowledge
that
will
help
him
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
the
searching
roots
or
to
guard
leaf
and
bud
from
invading
harm
the
disposition
to
hoard
had
been
utterly
crushed
at
the
very
first
by
the
loss
of
his
gold
the
coins
he
earned
afterwards
seemed
as
irrelevant
as
stones
brought
to
complete
a
house
suddenly
buried
by
an
earthquake
the
sense
of
bereavement
was
too
heavy
upon
him
for
the
old
thrill
of
satisfaction
to
arise
again
at
the
touch
of
the
coin
and
now
something
had
come
to
replace
his
hoard
which
gave
a
growing
purpose
to
the
earnings
drawing
his
hope
and
joy
continually
onward
beyond
the
money
in
old
days
there
were
angels
who
came
and
took
men
by
the
hand
and
led
them
away
from
the
city
of
destruction
we
see
no
angels
now
but
yet
men
are
led
away
from
threatening
destruction
a
hand
is
put
into
theirs
which
leads
them
forth
gently
towards
a
calm
and
bright
land
so
that
they
look
no
more
backward
and
the
hand
may
be
a
little
child
chapter
xv
there
was
one
person
as
you
will
believe
who
watched
with
keener
though
more
hidden
interest
than
any
other
the
prosperous
growth
of
eppie
under
the
weaver
care
he
dared
not
do
anything
that
would
imply
a
stronger
interest
in
a
poor
man
adopted
child
than
could
be
expected
from
the
kindliness
of
the
young
squire
when
a
chance
meeting
suggested
a
little
present
to
a
simple
old
fellow
whom
others
noticed
with
goodwill
but
he
told
himself
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
might
do
something
towards
furthering
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
without
incurring
suspicion
was
he
very
uneasy
in
the
meantime
at
his
inability
to
give
his
daughter
her
birthright
i
can
not
say
that
he
was
the
child
was
being
taken
care
of
and
would
very
likely
be
happy
as
people
in
humble
stations
often
were
happier
perhaps
than
those
brought
up
in
luxury
that
famous
ring
that
pricked
its
owner
when
he
forgot
duty
and
followed
desire
i
wonder
if
it
pricked
very
hard
when
he
set
out
on
the
chase
or
whether
it
pricked
but
lightly
then
and
only
pierced
to
the
quick
when
the
chase
had
long
been
ended
and
hope
folding
her
wings
looked
backward
and
became
regret
godfrey
cass
cheek
and
eye
were
brighter
than
ever
now
he
was
so
undivided
in
his
aims
that
he
seemed
like
a
man
of
firmness
no
dunsey
had
come
back
people
had
made
up
their
minds
that
he
was
gone
for
a
soldier
or
gone
out
of
the
country
and
no
one
cared
to
be
specific
in
their
inquiries
on
a
subject
delicate
to
a
respectable
family
godfrey
had
ceased
to
see
the
shadow
of
dunsey
across
his
path
and
the
path
now
lay
straight
forward
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
best
wishes
everybody
said
godfrey
had
taken
the
right
turn
and
it
was
pretty
clear
what
would
be
the
end
of
things
for
there
were
not
many
days
in
the
week
that
he
was
not
seen
riding
to
the
warrens
godfrey
himself
when
he
was
asked
jocosely
if
the
day
had
been
fixed
smiled
with
the
pleasant
consciousness
of
a
lover
who
could
say
yes
if
he
liked
he
felt
a
reformed
man
delivered
from
temptation
and
the
vision
of
his
future
life
seemed
to
him
as
a
promised
land
for
which
he
had
no
cause
to
fight
he
saw
himself
with
all
his
happiness
centred
on
his
own
hearth
while
nancy
would
smile
on
him
as
he
played
with
the
children
and
that
other
child
not
on
the
hearth
he
would
not
forget
it
he
would
see
that
it
was
well
provided
for
that
was
a
father
duty
part
two
chapter
xvi
it
was
a
bright
autumn
sunday
sixteen
years
after
silas
marner
had
found
his
new
treasure
on
the
hearth
the
bells
of
the
old
raveloe
church
were
ringing
the
cheerful
peal
which
told
that
the
morning
service
was
ended
and
out
of
the
arched
doorway
in
the
tower
came
slowly
retarded
by
friendly
greetings
and
questions
the
richer
parishioners
who
had
chosen
this
bright
sunday
morning
as
eligible
for
it
was
the
rural
fashion
of
that
time
for
the
more
important
members
of
the
congregation
to
depart
first
while
their
humbler
neighbours
waited
and
looked
on
stroking
their
bent
heads
or
dropping
their
curtsies
to
any
large
ratepayer
who
turned
to
notice
them
foremost
among
these
advancing
groups
of
people
there
are
some
whom
we
shall
recognize
in
spite
of
time
who
has
laid
his
hand
on
them
all
the
tall
blond
man
of
forty
is
not
much
changed
in
feature
from
the
godfrey
cass
of
he
is
only
fuller
in
flesh
and
has
only
lost
the
indefinable
look
of
youth
a
loss
which
is
marked
even
when
the
eye
is
undulled
and
the
wrinkles
are
not
yet
come
perhaps
the
pretty
woman
not
much
younger
than
he
who
is
leaning
on
his
arm
is
more
changed
than
her
husband
the
lovely
bloom
that
used
to
be
always
on
her
cheek
now
comes
but
fitfully
with
the
fresh
morning
air
or
with
some
strong
surprise
yet
to
all
who
love
human
faces
best
for
what
they
tell
of
human
experience
nancy
beauty
has
a
heightened
interest
often
the
soul
is
ripened
into
fuller
goodness
while
age
has
spread
an
ugly
film
so
that
mere
glances
can
never
divine
the
preciousness
of
the
fruit
but
the
years
have
not
been
so
cruel
to
nancy
the
firm
yet
placid
mouth
the
clear
veracious
glance
of
the
brown
eyes
speak
now
of
a
nature
that
has
been
tested
and
has
kept
its
highest
qualities
and
even
the
costume
with
its
dainty
neatness
and
purity
has
more
significance
now
the
coquetries
of
youth
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
godfrey
cass
any
higher
title
has
died
away
from
raveloe
lips
since
the
old
squire
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
his
inheritance
was
divided
have
turned
round
to
look
for
the
tall
aged
man
and
the
plainly
dressed
woman
who
are
a
little
behind
nancy
having
observed
that
they
must
wait
for
father
and
priscilla
and
now
they
all
turn
into
a
narrower
path
leading
across
the
churchyard
to
a
small
gate
opposite
the
red
house
we
will
not
follow
them
now
for
may
there
not
be
some
others
in
this
departing
congregation
whom
we
should
like
to
see
again
some
of
those
who
are
not
likely
to
be
handsomely
clad
and
whom
we
may
not
recognize
so
easily
as
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
red
house
but
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
silas
marner
his
large
brown
eyes
seem
to
have
gathered
a
longer
vision
as
is
the
way
with
eyes
that
have
been
in
early
life
and
they
have
a
less
vague
a
more
answering
gaze
but
in
everything
else
one
sees
signs
of
a
frame
much
enfeebled
by
the
lapse
of
the
sixteen
years
the
weaver
bent
shoulders
and
white
hair
give
him
almost
the
look
of
advanced
age
though
he
is
not
more
than
but
there
is
the
freshest
blossom
of
youth
close
by
his
side
a
blonde
dimpled
girl
of
eighteen
who
has
vainly
tried
to
chastise
her
curly
auburn
hair
into
smoothness
under
her
brown
bonnet
the
hair
ripples
as
obstinately
as
a
brooklet
under
the
march
breeze
and
the
little
ringlets
burst
away
from
the
restraining
comb
behind
and
show
themselves
below
the
eppie
can
not
help
being
rather
vexed
about
her
hair
for
there
is
no
other
girl
in
raveloe
who
has
hair
at
all
like
it
and
she
thinks
hair
ought
to
be
smooth
she
does
not
like
to
be
blameworthy
even
in
small
things
you
see
how
neatly
her
is
folded
in
her
spotted
handkerchief
that
young
fellow
in
a
new
fustian
suit
who
walks
behind
her
is
not
quite
sure
upon
the
question
of
hair
in
the
abstract
when
eppie
puts
it
to
him
and
thinks
that
perhaps
straight
hair
is
the
best
in
general
but
he
does
want
eppie
hair
to
be
different
she
surely
divines
that
there
is
some
one
behind
her
who
is
thinking
about
her
very
particularly
and
mustering
courage
to
come
to
her
side
as
soon
as
they
are
out
in
the
lane
else
why
should
she
look
rather
shy
and
take
care
not
to
turn
away
her
head
from
her
father
silas
to
whom
she
keeps
murmuring
little
sentences
as
to
who
was
at
church
and
who
was
not
at
church
and
how
pretty
the
red
is
over
the
rectory
wall
i
wish
had
a
little
garden
father
with
double
daisies
in
like
winthrop
said
eppie
when
they
were
out
in
the
lane
only
they
say
it
take
a
deal
of
digging
and
bringing
fresh
soil
and
you
could
do
that
could
you
father
anyhow
i
should
like
you
to
do
it
for
it
be
too
hard
work
for
you
yes
i
could
do
it
child
if
you
want
a
bit
o
garden
these
long
evenings
i
could
work
at
taking
in
a
little
bit
o
the
waste
just
enough
for
a
root
or
two
o
flowers
for
you
and
again
i
the
morning
i
could
have
a
turn
wi
the
spade
before
i
sat
down
to
the
loom
why
did
you
tell
me
before
as
you
wanted
a
bit
o
garden
can
dig
it
for
you
master
marner
said
the
young
man
in
fustian
who
was
now
by
eppie
side
entering
into
the
conversation
without
the
trouble
of
formalities
it
be
play
to
me
after
i
done
my
work
or
any
odd
bits
o
time
when
the
work
slack
and
i
bring
you
some
soil
from
cass
garden
he
let
me
and
willing
eh
aaron
my
lad
are
you
there
said
silas
i
was
aware
of
you
for
when
eppie
talking
o
things
i
see
nothing
but
what
well
if
you
could
help
me
with
the
digging
we
might
get
her
a
bit
o
garden
all
the
sooner
then
if
you
think
well
and
good
said
aaron
i
come
to
the
this
afternoon
and
we
settle
what
land
to
be
taken
in
and
i
get
up
an
hour
earlier
i
the
morning
and
begin
on
it
but
not
if
you
do
promise
me
not
to
work
at
the
hard
digging
father
said
eppie
for
i
should
ha
said
anything
about
it
she
added
only
winthrop
said
as
aaron
be
so
good
and
and
you
might
ha
known
it
without
mother
telling
you
said
aaron
and
master
marner
knows
too
i
hope
as
i
able
and
willing
to
do
a
turn
o
work
for
him
and
he
wo
do
me
the
unkindness
to
anyways
take
it
out
o
my
hands
there
now
father
you
wo
work
in
it
till
it
all
easy
said
eppie
and
you
and
me
can
mark
out
the
beds
and
make
holes
and
plant
the
roots
it
be
a
deal
livelier
at
the
when
we
got
some
flowers
for
i
always
think
the
flowers
can
see
us
and
know
what
we
talking
about
and
i
have
a
bit
o
rosemary
and
bergamot
and
thyme
because
they
so
but
there
no
lavender
only
in
the
gentlefolks
gardens
i
think
that
no
reason
why
you
should
have
some
said
aaron
for
i
can
bring
you
slips
of
anything
i
forced
to
cut
no
end
of
when
gardening
and
throw
away
mostly
there
a
big
bed
o
lavender
at
the
red
house
the
missis
is
very
fond
of
it
well
said
silas
gravely
so
as
you
do
make
free
for
us
or
ask
for
anything
as
is
worth
much
at
the
red
house
for
cass
been
so
good
to
us
and
built
us
up
the
new
end
o
the
cottage
and
given
us
beds
and
things
as
i
could
abide
to
be
imposin
for
or
anything
else
no
no
there
no
imposin
said
aaron
there
never
a
garden
in
all
the
parish
but
what
there
endless
waste
in
it
for
want
somebody
as
could
use
everything
up
it
what
i
think
to
myself
sometimes
as
there
need
nobody
run
short
o
victuals
if
the
land
was
made
the
most
on
and
there
was
never
a
morsel
but
what
could
find
its
way
to
a
mouth
it
sets
one
thinking
o
that
gardening
does
but
i
must
go
back
now
else
mother
be
in
trouble
as
i
are
there
bring
her

this
afternoon
aaron

eppie

aaron
said
silas
she
sure
to
have
a
word
to
say
as
help
us
to
set
things
on
their
right
end
aaron
turned
back
up
the
village
while
silas
and
eppie
went
on
up
the
lonely
sheltered
lane
o
daddy
she
began
when
they
were
in
privacy
clasping
and
squeezing
silas
arm
and
skipping
round
to
give
him
an
energetic
kiss
my
little
old
daddy
i
so
glad
i
do
think
i
shall
want
anything
else
when
we
got
a
little
garden
and
i
knew
aaron
would
dig
it
for
us
she
went
on
with
roguish
triumph
i
knew
that
very
well
you
a
deep
little
puss
you
are
said
silas
with
the
mild
passive
happiness
of
age
in
his
face
but
you
make
yourself
fine
and
beholden
to
aaron
oh
no
i
sha
said
eppie
laughing
and
frisking
he
likes
it
come
come
let
me
carry
your
else
you
be
dropping
it
jumping
i
that
way
eppie
was
now
aware
that
her
behaviour
was
under
observation
but
it
was
only
the
observation
of
a
friendly
donkey
browsing
with
a
log
fastened
to
his
foot
a
meek
donkey
not
scornfully
critical
of
human
trivialities
but
thankful
to
share
in
them
if
possible
by
getting
his
nose
scratched
and
eppie
did
not
fail
to
gratify
him
with
her
usual
notice
though
it
was
attended
with
the
inconvenience
of
his
following
them
painfully
up
to
the
very
door
of
their
home
but
the
sound
of
a
sharp
bark
inside
as
eppie
put
the
key
in
the
door
modified
the
donkey
views
and
he
limped
away
again
without
bidding
the
sharp
bark
was
the
sign
of
an
excited
welcome
that
was
awaiting
them
from
a
knowing
brown
terrier
who
after
dancing
at
their
legs
in
a
hysterical
manner
rushed
with
a
worrying
noise
at
a
kitten
under
the
loom
and
then
rushed
back
with
a
sharp
bark
again
as
much
as
to
say
i
have
done
my
duty
by
this
feeble
creature
you
perceive
while
the
of
the
kitten
sat
sunning
her
white
bosom
in
the
window
and
looked
round
with
a
sleepy
air
of
expecting
caresses
though
she
was
not
going
to
take
any
trouble
for
them
the
presence
of
this
happy
animal
life
was
not
the
only
change
which
had
come
over
the
interior
of
the
stone
cottage
there
was
no
bed
now
in
the
and
the
small
space
was
well
filled
with
decent
furniture
all
bright
and
clean
enough
to
satisfy
dolly
winthrop
eye
the
oaken
table
and
oaken
chair
were
hardly
what
was
likely
to
be
seen
in
so
poor
a
cottage
they
had
come
with
the
beds
and
other
things
from
the
red
house
for
godfrey
cass
as
every
one
said
in
the
village
did
very
kindly
by
the
weaver
and
it
was
nothing
but
right
a
man
should
be
looked
on
and
helped
by
those
who
could
afford
it
when
he
had
brought
up
an
orphan
child
and
been
father
and
mother
to
her
and
had
lost
his
money
too
so
as
he
had
nothing
but
what
he
worked
for
week
by
week
and
when
the
weaving
was
going
down
too
for
there
was
less
and
less
flax
spun
and
master
marner
was
none
so
young
nobody
was
jealous
of
the
weaver
for
he
was
regarded
as
an
exceptional
person
whose
claims
on
neighbourly
help
were
not
to
be
matched
in
raveloe
any
superstition
that
remained
concerning
him
had
taken
an
entirely
new
colour
and
macey
now
a
very
feeble
old
man
of
fourscore
and
six
never
seen
except
in
his
or
sitting
in
the
sunshine
at
his
was
of
opinion
that
when
a
man
had
done
what
silas
had
done
by
an
orphan
child
it
was
a
sign
that
his
money
would
come
to
light
again
or
leastwise
that
the
robber
would
be
made
to
answer
for
it
for
as
macey
observed
of
himself
his
faculties
were
as
strong
as
ever
silas
sat
down
now
and
watched
eppie
with
a
satisfied
gaze
as
she
spread
the
clean
cloth
and
set
on
it
the
warmed
up
slowly
in
a
safe
sunday
fashion
by
being
put
into
a
dry
pot
over
a
fire
as
the
best
substitute
for
an
oven
for
silas
would
not
consent
to
have
a
grate
and
oven
added
to
his
conveniences
he
loved
the
old
brick
hearth
as
he
had
loved
his
brown
pot
and
was
it
not
there
when
he
had
found
eppie
the
gods
of
the
hearth
exist
for
us
still
and
let
all
new
faith
be
tolerant
of
that
fetishism
lest
it
bruise
its
own
roots
silas
ate
his
dinner
more
silently
than
usual
soon
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
watching
eppie
play
with
snap
and
the
cat
by
which
her
own
dining
was
made
rather
a
lengthy
business
yet
it
was
a
sight
that
might
well
arrest
wandering
thoughts
eppie
with
the
rippling
radiance
of
her
hair
and
the
whiteness
of
her
rounded
chin
and
throat
set
off
by
the
cotton
gown
laughing
merrily
as
the
kitten
held
on
with
her
four
claws
to
one
shoulder
like
a
design
for
a
while
snap
on
the
right
hand
and
puss
on
the
other
put
up
their
paws
towards
a
morsel
which
she
held
out
of
the
reach
of
both
snap
occasionally
desisting
in
order
to
remonstrate
with
the
cat
by
a
cogent
worrying
growl
on
the
greediness
and
futility
of
her
conduct
till
eppie
relented
caressed
them
both
and
divided
the
morsel
between
them
but
at
last
eppie
glancing
at
the
clock
checked
the
play
and
said
o
daddy
you
wanting
to
go
into
the
sunshine
to
smoke
your
pipe
but
i
must
clear
away
first
so
as
the
house
may
be
tidy
when
godmother
comes
i
make
haste
i
wo
be
long
silas
had
taken
to
smoking
a
pipe
daily
during
the
last
two
years
having
been
strongly
urged
to
it
by
the
sages
of
raveloe
as
a
practice
good
for
the
fits
and
this
advice
was
sanctioned
by
kimble
on
the
ground
that
it
was
as
well
to
try
what
could
do
no
harm
a
principle
which
was
made
to
answer
for
a
great
deal
of
work
in
that
gentleman
medical
practice
silas
did
not
highly
enjoy
smoking
and
often
wondered
how
his
neighbours
could
be
so
fond
of
it
but
a
humble
sort
of
acquiescence
in
what
was
held
to
be
good
had
become
a
strong
habit
of
that
new
self
which
had
been
developed
in
him
since
he
had
found
eppie
on
his
hearth
it
had
been
the
only
clew
his
bewildered
mind
could
hold
by
in
cherishing
this
young
life
that
had
been
sent
to
him
out
of
the
darkness
into
which
his
gold
had
departed
by
seeking
what
was
needful
for
eppie
by
sharing
the
effect
that
everything
produced
on
her
he
had
himself
come
to
appropriate
the
forms
of
custom
and
belief
which
were
the
mould
of
raveloe
life
and
as
with
reawakening
sensibilities
memory
also
reawakened
he
had
begun
to
ponder
over
the
elements
of
his
old
faith
and
blend
them
with
his
new
impressions
till
he
recovered
a
consciousness
of
unity
between
his
past
and
present
the
sense
of
presiding
goodness
and
the
human
trust
which
come
with
all
pure
peace
and
joy
had
given
him
a
dim
impression
that
there
had
been
some
error
some
mistake
which
had
thrown
that
dark
shadow
over
the
days
of
his
best
years
and
as
it
grew
more
and
more
easy
to
him
to
open
his
mind
to
dolly
winthrop
he
gradually
communicated
to
her
all
he
could
describe
of
his
early
life
the
communication
was
necessarily
a
slow
and
difficult
process
for
meagre
power
of
explanation
was
not
aided
by
any
readiness
of
interpretation
in
dolly
whose
narrow
outward
experience
gave
her
no
key
to
strange
customs
and
made
every
novelty
a
source
of
wonder
that
arrested
them
at
every
step
of
the
narrative
it
was
only
by
fragments
and
at
intervals
which
left
dolly
time
to
revolve
what
she
had
heard
till
it
acquired
some
familiarity
for
her
that
silas
at
last
arrived
at
the
climax
of
the
sad
story
the
drawing
of
lots
and
its
false
testimony
concerning
him
and
this
had
to
be
repeated
in
several
interviews
under
new
questions
on
her
part
as
to
the
nature
of
this
plan
for
detecting
the
guilty
and
clearing
the
innocent
and
yourn
the
same
bible
you
sure
o
that
master
marner
the
bible
as
you
brought
wi
you
from
that
country
it
the
same
as
what
they
got
at
church
and
what
eppie
to
read
in
yes
said
silas
every
bit
the
same
and
there
drawing
o
lots
in
the
bible
mind
you
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
oh
dear
dear
said
dolly
in
a
grieved
voice
as
if
she
were
hearing
an
unfavourable
report
of
a
sick
man
case
she
was
silent
for
some
minutes
at
last
she
said
there
wise
folks
happen
as
know
how
it
all
is
the
parson
knows
i
be
bound
but
it
takes
big
words
to
tell
them
things
and
such
as
poor
folks
ca
make
much
out
on
i
can
never
rightly
know
the
meaning
o
what
i
hear
at
church
only
a
bit
here
and
there
but
i
know
it
good
words
i
do
but
what
lies
upo
your
mind
it
this
master
marner
as
if
them
above
had
done
the
right
thing
by
you
they
never
ha
let
you
be
turned
out
for
a
wicked
thief
when
you
was
innicent
ah
said
silas
who
had
now
come
to
understand
dolly
phraseology
that
was
what
fell
on
me
like
as
if
it
had
been
iron
because
you
see
there
was
nobody
as
cared
for
me
or
clave
to
me
above
nor
below
and
him
as
i
gone
out
and
in
wi
for
ten
year
and
more
since
when
we
was
lads
and
went
halves
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
had
lifted
up
his
heel
again
me
and
worked
to
ruin
me
eh
but
he
was
a
bad
un
i
ca
think
as
there
another
such
said
dolly
but
i
master
marner
i
like
as
if
i
waked
and
did
know
whether
it
was
night
or
morning
i
feel
somehow
as
sure
as
i
do
when
i
laid
something
up
though
i
ca
justly
put
my
hand
on
it
as
there
was
a
rights
in
what
happened
to
you
if
one
could
but
make
it
out
and
you
no
call
to
lose
heart
as
you
did
but
talk
on
it
again
for
sometimes
things
come
into
my
head
when
leeching
or
poulticing
or
such
as
i
could
never
think
on
when
i
was
sitting
still
dolly
was
too
useful
a
woman
not
to
have
many
opportunities
of
illumination
of
the
kind
she
alluded
to
and
she
was
not
long
before
she
recurred
to
the
subject
master
marner
she
said
one
day
that
she
came
to
bring
home
washing
i
been
sore
puzzled
for
a
good
bit
wi
that
trouble
yourn
and
the
drawing
o
lots
and
it
got
twisted
and
as
i
did
know
which
end
to
lay
hold
on
but
it
come
to
me
all
clear
like
that
night
when
i
was
sitting
up
wi
poor
bessy
fawkes
as
is
dead
and
left
her
children
behind
god
help
it
come
to
me
as
clear
as
daylight
but
whether
i
got
hold
on
it
now
or
can
anyways
bring
it
to
my
tongue
end
that
i
do
know
for
i
often
a
deal
inside
me
as
never
come
out
and
for
what
you
talk
o
your
folks
in
your
old
country
niver
saying
prayers
by
heart
nor
saying
out
of
a
book
they
must
be
wonderful
cliver
for
if
i
did
know
our
father
and
little
bits
o
good
words
as
i
can
carry
out
o
church
wi
me
i
might
down
o
my
knees
every
night
but
nothing
could
i
say
but
you
can
mostly
say
something
as
i
can
make
sense
on
winthrop
said
silas
well
then
master
marner
it
come
to
me
summat
like
this
i
can
make
nothing
o
the
drawing
o
lots
and
the
answer
coming
wrong
it
mayhap
take
the
parson
to
tell
that
and
he
could
only
tell
us
i
big
words
but
what
come
to
me
as
clear
as
the
daylight
it
was
when
i
was
troubling
over
poor
bessy
fawkes
and
it
allays
comes
into
my
head
when
i
sorry
for
folks
and
feel
as
i
ca
do
a
power
to
help
not
if
i
was
to
get
up
i
the
middle
o
the
night
it
comes
into
my
head
as
them
above
has
got
a
deal
tenderer
heart
nor
what
i
got
for
i
be
anyways
better
nor
them
as
made
me
and
if
anything
looks
hard
to
me
it
because
there
things
i
do
know
on
and
for
the
matter
that
there
may
be
plenty
o
things
i
do
know
on
for
it
little
as
i
know
that
it
is
and
so
while
i
was
thinking
o
that
you
come
into
my
mind
master
marner
and
it
all
come
pouring
in
if
felt
i
my
inside
what
was
the
right
and
just
thing
by
you
and
them
as
prayed
and
drawed
the
lots
all
but
that
wicked
un
if
ha
done
the
right
thing
by
you
if
they
could
is
there
them
as
was
at
the
making
on
us
and
knows
better
and
has
a
better
will
and
that
all
as
ever
i
can
be
sure
on
and
everything
else
is
a
big
puzzle
to
me
when
i
think
on
it
for
there
was
the
fever
come
and
took
off
them
as
were
and
left
the
helpless
children
and
there
the
breaking
o
limbs
and
them
as
do
right
and
be
sober
have
to
suffer
by
them
as
are
contrairy
eh
there
trouble
i
this
world
and
there
things
as
we
can
niver
make
out
the
rights
on
and
all
as
we
got
to
do
is
to
trusten
master
marner
to
do
the
right
thing
as
fur
as
we
know
and
to
trusten
for
if
us
as
knows
so
little
can
see
a
bit
o
good
and
rights
we
may
be
sure
as
there
a
good
and
a
rights
bigger
nor
what
we
can
know
i
feel
it
i
my
own
inside
as
it
must
be
so
and
if
you
could
but
ha
gone
on
trustening
master
marner
you
would
ha
run
away
from
your
and
been
so
lone
ah
but
that
ha
been
hard
said
silas
in
an
it
ha
been
hard
to
trusten
then
and
so
it
would
said
dolly
almost
with
compunction
them
things
are
easier
said
nor
done
and
i
partly
ashamed
o
talking
nay
nay
said
silas
you
i
the
right
winthrop
you
the
right
there
good
i
this
world
i
a
feeling
o
that
now
and
it
makes
a
man
feel
as
there
a
good
more
nor
he
can
see
i
spite
the
trouble
and
the
wickedness
that
drawing
o
the
lots
is
dark
but
the
child
was
sent
to
me
there
dealings
with
us
there
dealings
this
dialogue
took
place
in
eppie
earlier
years
when
silas
had
to
part
with
her
for
two
hours
every
day
that
she
might
learn
to
read
at
the
dame
school
after
he
had
vainly
tried
himself
to
guide
her
in
that
first
step
to
learning
now
that
she
was
grown
up
silas
had
often
been
led
in
those
moments
of
quiet
outpouring
which
come
to
people
who
live
together
in
perfect
love
to
talk
with
too
of
the
past
and
how
and
why
he
had
lived
a
lonely
man
until
she
had
been
sent
to
him
for
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
hide
from
eppie
that
she
was
not
his
own
child
even
if
the
most
delicate
reticence
on
the
point
could
have
been
expected
from
raveloe
gossips
in
her
presence
her
own
questions
about
her
mother
could
not
have
been
parried
as
she
grew
up
without
that
complete
shrouding
of
the
past
which
would
have
made
a
painful
barrier
between
their
minds
so
eppie
had
long
known
how
her
mother
had
died
on
the
snowy
ground
and
how
she
herself
had
been
found
on
the
hearth
by
father
silas
who
had
taken
her
golden
curls
for
his
lost
guineas
brought
back
to
him
the
tender
and
peculiar
love
with
which
silas
had
reared
her
in
almost
inseparable
companionship
with
himself
aided
by
the
seclusion
of
their
dwelling
had
preserved
her
from
the
lowering
influences
of
the
village
talk
and
habits
and
had
kept
her
mind
in
that
freshness
which
is
sometimes
falsely
supposed
to
be
an
invariable
attribute
of
rusticity
perfect
love
has
a
breath
of
poetry
which
can
exalt
the
relations
of
the
human
beings
and
this
breath
of
poetry
had
surrounded
eppie
from
the
time
when
she
had
followed
the
bright
gleam
that
beckoned
her
to
hearth
so
that
it
is
not
surprising
if
in
other
things
besides
her
delicate
prettiness
she
was
not
quite
a
common
village
maiden
but
had
a
touch
of
refinement
and
fervour
which
came
from
no
other
teaching
than
that
of
unvitiated
feeling
she
was
too
childish
and
simple
for
her
imagination
to
rove
into
questions
about
her
unknown
father
for
a
long
while
it
did
not
even
occur
to
her
that
she
must
have
had
a
father
and
the
first
time
that
the
idea
of
her
mother
having
had
a
husband
presented
itself
to
her
was
when
silas
showed
her
the
which
had
been
taken
from
the
wasted
finger
and
had
been
carefully
preserved
by
him
in
a
little
lackered
box
shaped
like
a
shoe
he
delivered
this
box
into
eppie
charge
when
she
had
grown
up
and
she
often
opened
it
to
look
at
the
ring
but
still
she
thought
hardly
at
all
about
the
father
of
whom
it
was
the
symbol
had
she
not
a
father
very
close
to
her
who
loved
her
better
than
any
real
fathers
in
the
village
seemed
to
love
their
daughters
on
the
contrary
who
her
mother
was
and
how
she
came
to
die
in
that
forlornness
were
questions
that
often
pressed
on
eppie
mind
her
knowledge
of
winthrop
who
was
her
nearest
friend
next
to
silas
made
her
feel
that
a
mother
must
be
very
precious
and
she
had
again
and
again
asked
silas
to
tell
her
how
her
mother
looked
whom
she
was
like
and
how
he
had
found
her
against
the
furze
bush
led
towards
it
by
the
little
footsteps
and
the
outstretched
arms
the
furze
bush
was
there
still
and
this
afternoon
when
eppie
came
out
with
silas
into
the
sunshine
it
was
the
first
object
that
arrested
her
eyes
and
thoughts
father
she
said
in
a
tone
of
gentle
gravity
which
sometimes
came
like
a
sadder
slower
cadence
across
her
playfulness
we
shall
take
the
furze
bush
into
the
garden
it
come
into
the
corner
and
just
against
it
i
put
snowdrops
and
crocuses
aaron
says
they
wo
die
out
but
always
get
more
and
more
ah
child
said
silas
always
ready
to
talk
when
he
had
his
pipe
in
his
hand
apparently
enjoying
the
pauses
more
than
the
puffs
it
would
do
to
leave
out
the
furze
bush
and
there
nothing
prettier
to
my
thinking
when
it
yallow
with
flowers
but
it
just
come
into
my
head
what
we
to
do
for
a
fence
mayhap
aaron
can
help
us
to
a
thought
but
a
fence
we
must
have
else
the
donkeys
and
things
come
and
trample
everything
down
and
fencing
hard
to
be
got
at
by
what
i
can
make
out
oh
i
tell
you
daddy
said
eppie
clasping
her
hands
suddenly
after
a
minute
thought
there
lots
o
loose
stones
about
some
of
not
big
and
we
might
lay
atop
of
one
another
and
make
a
wall
you
and
me
could
carry
the
smallest
and
aaron
carry
the
rest
i
know
he
would
eh
my
precious
un
said
silas
there
is
enough
stones
to
go
all
round
and
as
for
you
carrying
why
wi
your
little
arms
you
carry
a
stone
no
bigger
than
a
turnip
you
dillicate
made
my
dear
he
added
with
a
tender
intonation
that
what
winthrop
says
oh
i
stronger
than
you
think
daddy
said
eppie
and
if
there
was
stones
enough
to
go
all
round
why
they
go
part
o
the
way
and
then
it
be
easier
to
get
sticks
and
things
for
the
rest
see
here
round
the
big
pit
what
a
many
stones
she
skipped
forward
to
the
pit
meaning
to
lift
one
of
the
stones
and
exhibit
her
strength
but
she
started
back
in
surprise
oh
father
just
come
and
look
here
she
exclaimed
come
and
see
how
the
water
gone
down
since
yesterday
why
yesterday
the
pit
was
ever
so
full
well
to
be
sure
said
silas
coming
to
her
side
why
that
the
draining
they
begun
on
since
harvest
i
osgood
fields
i
reckon
the
foreman
said
to
me
the
other
day
when
i
passed
by
master
marner
he
said
i
should
wonder
if
we
lay
your
bit
waste
as
dry
as
a
bone
it
was
godfrey
cass
he
said
had
gone
into
the
draining
he
been
taking
these
fields
o
mr
osgood
how
odd
it
seem
to
have
the
old
pit
dried
up
said
eppie
turning
away
and
stooping
to
lift
rather
a
large
stone
see
daddy
i
can
carry
this
quite
well
she
said
going
along
with
much
energy
for
a
few
steps
but
presently
letting
it
fall
ah
you
fine
and
strong
are
you
said
silas
while
eppie
shook
her
aching
arms
and
laughed
come
come
let
us
go
and
sit
down
on
the
bank
against
the
stile
there
and
have
no
more
lifting
you
might
hurt
yourself
child
you
need
have
somebody
to
work
for
you
and
my
arm
is
over
strong
silas
uttered
the
last
sentence
slowly
as
if
it
implied
more
than
met
the
ear
and
eppie
when
they
sat
down
on
the
bank
nestled
close
to
his
side
and
taking
hold
caressingly
of
the
arm
that
was
not
over
strong
held
it
on
her
lap
while
silas
puffed
again
dutifully
at
the
pipe
which
occupied
his
other
arm
an
ash
in
the
hedgerow
behind
made
a
fretted
screen
from
the
sun
and
threw
happy
playful
shadows
all
about
them
father
said
eppie
very
gently
after
they
had
been
sitting
in
silence
a
little
while
if
i
was
to
be
married
ought
i
to
be
married
with
my
mother
ring
silas
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
start
though
the
question
fell
in
with
the
of
thought
in
his
own
mind
and
then
said
in
a
subdued
tone
why
eppie
have
you
been
on
it
only
this
last
week
father
said
eppie
ingenuously
since
aaron
talked
to
me
about
it
and
what
did
he
say
said
silas
still
in
the
same
subdued
way
as
if
he
were
anxious
lest
he
should
fall
into
the
slightest
tone
that
was
not
for
eppie
good
he
said
he
should
like
to
be
married
because
he
was
in
and
had
got
a
deal
of
gardening
work
now
given
up
and
he
goes
twice
regular
to
cass
and
once
to
osgood
and
they
going
to
take
him
on
at
the
rectory
and
who
is
it
as
he
wanting
to
marry
said
silas
with
rather
a
sad
smile
why
me
to
be
sure
daddy
said
eppie
with
dimpling
laughter
kissing
her
father
cheek
as
if
he
want
to
marry
anybody
else
and
you
mean
to
have
him
do
you
said
silas
yes
some
time
said
eppie
i
do
know
when
everybody
married
some
time
aaron
says
but
i
told
him
that
was
true
for
i
said
look
at
father
he
never
been
married
no
child
said
silas
your
father
was
a
lone
man
till
you
was
sent
to
him
but
you
never
be
lone
again
father
said
eppie
tenderly
that
was
what
aaron
said
i
could
never
think
o
taking
you
away
from
master
marner
eppie
and
i
said
it
be
no
use
if
you
did
aaron
and
he
wants
us
all
to
live
together
so
as
you
need
work
a
bit
father
only
what
for
your
own
pleasure
and
he
be
as
good
as
a
son
to
you
that
was
what
he
said
and
should
you
like
that
eppie
said
silas
looking
at
her
i
should
mind
it
father
said
eppie
quite
simply
and
i
should
like
things
to
be
so
as
you
need
work
much
but
if
it
was
for
that
i
sooner
things
did
change
i
very
happy
i
like
aaron
to
be
fond
of
me
and
come
and
see
us
often
and
behave
pretty
to
you
he
always
behave
pretty
to
you
does
he
father
yes
child
nobody
could
behave
better
said
silas
emphatically
he
his
mother
lad
but
i
do
want
any
change
said
eppie
i
should
like
to
go
on
a
long
long
while
just
as
we
are
only
aaron
does
want
a
change
and
he
made
me
cry
a
bit
only
a
bit
because
he
said
i
did
care
for
him
for
if
i
cared
for
him
i
should
want
us
to
be
married
as
he
did
eh
my
blessed
child
said
silas
laying
down
his
pipe
as
if
it
were
useless
to
pretend
to
smoke
any
longer
you
young
to
be
married
we
ask
winthrop
we
ask
aaron
mother
what
thinks
if
there
a
right
thing
to
do
she
come
at
it
but
this
to
be
thought
on
eppie
things
change
whether
we
like
it
or
no
things
wo
go
on
for
a
long
while
just
as
they
are
and
no
difference
i
shall
get
older
and
helplesser
and
be
a
burden
on
you
belike
if
i
do
go
away
from
you
altogether
not
as
i
mean
think
me
a
burden
i
know
you
would
but
it
be
hard
upon
you
and
when
i
look
to
that
i
like
to
think
as
you
have
somebody
else
besides
me
somebody
young
and
strong
as
outlast
your
own
life
and
take
care
on
you
to
the
end
silas
paused
and
resting
his
wrists
on
his
knees
lifted
his
hands
up
and
down
meditatively
as
he
looked
on
the
ground
then
would
you
like
me
to
be
married
father
said
eppie
with
a
little
trembling
in
her
voice
i
not
be
the
man
to
say
no
eppie
said
silas
emphatically
but
we
ask
your
godmother
she
wish
the
right
thing
by
you
and
her
son
too
there
they
come
then
said
eppie
let
us
go
and
meet
oh
the
pipe
wo
you
have
it
lit
again
father
said
eppie
lifting
that
medicinal
appliance
from
the
ground
nay
child
said
silas
i
done
enough
for
i
think
mayhap
a
little
of
it
does
me
more
good
than
so
much
at
once
chapter
xvii
while
silas
and
eppie
were
seated
on
the
bank
discoursing
in
the
fleckered
shade
of
the
ash
tree
miss
priscilla
lammeter
was
resisting
her
sister
arguments
that
it
would
be
better
to
take
tea
at
the
red
house
and
let
her
father
have
a
long
nap
than
drive
home
to
the
warrens
so
soon
after
dinner
the
family
party
of
four
only
were
seated
round
the
table
in
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
with
the
sunday
dessert
before
them
of
fresh
filberts
apples
and
pears
duly
ornamented
with
leaves
by
nancy
own
hand
before
the
bells
had
rung
for
church
a
great
change
has
come
over
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
since
we
saw
it
in
godfrey
bachelor
days
and
under
the
wifeless
reign
of
the
old
squire
now
all
is
polish
on
which
no
yesterday
dust
is
ever
allowed
to
rest
from
the
yard
width
of
oaken
boards
round
the
carpet
to
the
old
squire
gun
and
whips
and
ranged
on
the
stag
antlers
above
the
mantelpiece
all
other
signs
of
sporting
and
outdoor
occupation
nancy
has
removed
to
another
room
but
she
has
brought
into
the
red
house
the
habit
of
filial
reverence
and
preserves
sacredly
in
a
place
of
honour
these
relics
of
her
husband
departed
father
the
tankards
are
on
the
still
but
the
bossed
silver
is
undimmed
by
handling
and
there
are
no
dregs
to
send
forth
unpleasant
suggestions
the
only
prevailing
scent
is
of
the
lavender
and
that
fill
the
vases
of
derbyshire
spar
all
is
purity
and
order
in
this
once
dreary
room
for
fifteen
years
ago
it
was
entered
by
a
new
presiding
spirit
now
father
said
nancy
there
any
call
for
you
to
go
home
to
tea
may
you
just
as
well
stay
with
us
such
a
beautiful
evening
as
it
likely
to
be
the
old
gentleman
had
been
talking
with
godfrey
about
the
increasing
and
the
ruinous
times
and
had
not
heard
the
dialogue
between
his
daughters
my
dear
you
must
ask
priscilla
he
said
in
the
once
firm
voice
now
become
rather
broken
she
manages
me
and
the
farm
too
and
reason
good
as
i
should
manage
you
father
said
priscilla
else
you
be
giving
yourself
your
death
with
rheumatism
and
as
for
the
farm
if
anything
turns
out
wrong
as
it
ca
but
do
in
these
times
there
nothing
kills
a
man
so
soon
as
having
nobody
to
find
fault
with
but
himself
it
a
deal
the
best
way
o
being
master
to
let
somebody
else
do
the
ordering
and
keep
the
blaming
in
your
own
hands
it
save
many
a
man
a
stroke
believe
well
well
my
dear
said
her
father
with
a
quiet
laugh
i
say
you
do
manage
for
everybody
good
then
manage
so
as
you
may
stay
tea
priscilla
said
nancy
putting
her
hand
on
her
sister
arm
affectionately
come
now
and
we
go
round
the
garden
while
father
has
his
nap
my
dear
child
he
have
a
beautiful
nap
in
the
gig
for
i
shall
drive
and
as
for
staying
tea
i
ca
hear
of
it
for
there
this
dairymaid
now
she
knows
she
to
be
married
turned
michaelmas
as
lief
pour
the
new
milk
into
the
as
into
the
pans
the
way
with
all
it
as
if
they
thought
the
world
be
because
they
to
be
married
so
come
and
let
me
put
my
bonnet
on
and
there
be
time
for
us
to
walk
round
the
garden
while
the
horse
is
being
put
in
when
the
sisters
were
treading
the
between
the
bright
turf
that
contrasted
pleasantly
with
the
dark
cones
and
arches
and
hedges
of
yew
priscilla
said
i
as
glad
as
anything
at
your
husband
making
that
exchange
o
land
with
cousin
osgood
and
beginning
the
dairying
it
a
thousand
pities
you
did
do
it
before
for
it
give
you
something
to
fill
your
mind
there
nothing
like
a
dairy
if
folks
want
a
bit
o
worrit
to
make
the
days
pass
for
as
for
rubbing
furniture
when
you
can
once
see
your
face
in
a
table
there
nothing
else
to
look
for
but
always
something
fresh
with
the
dairy
for
even
in
the
depths
o
winter
there
some
pleasure
in
conquering
the
butter
and
making
it
come
whether
or
no
my
dear
added
priscilla
pressing
her
sister
hand
affectionately
as
they
walked
side
by
side
you
never
be
low
when
you
got
a
dairy
ah
priscilla
said
nancy
returning
the
pressure
with
a
grateful
glance
of
her
clear
eyes
but
it
wo
make
up
to
godfrey
a
not
so
much
to
a
man
and
it
only
what
he
cares
for
that
ever
makes
me
low
i
contented
with
the
blessings
we
have
if
he
could
be
contented
it
drives
me
past
patience
said
priscilla
impetuously
that
way
the
men
always
wanting
and
wanting
and
never
easy
with
what
got
they
ca
sit
comfortable
in
their
chairs
when
they
neither
ache
nor
pain
but
either
they
must
stick
a
pipe
in
their
mouths
to
make
better
than
well
or
else
they
must
be
swallowing
something
strong
though
they
forced
to
make
haste
before
the
next
meal
comes
in
but
joyful
be
it
spoken
our
father
was
never
that
sort
o
man
and
if
it
had
pleased
god
to
make
you
ugly
like
me
so
as
the
men
would
ha
run
after
you
we
might
have
kept
to
our
own
family
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
folks
as
have
got
uneasy
blood
in
their
veins
oh
do
say
so
priscilla
said
nancy
repenting
that
she
had
called
forth
this
outburst
nobody
has
any
occasion
to
find
fault
with
godfrey
it
natural
he
should
be
disappointed
at
not
having
any
children
every
man
likes
to
have
somebody
to
work
for
and
lay
by
for
and
he
always
counted
so
on
making
a
fuss
with
when
they
were
little
there
many
another
man
hanker
more
than
he
does
the
best
of
husbands
oh
i
know
said
priscilla
smiling
sarcastically
i
know
the
way
wives
they
set
one
on
to
abuse
their
husbands
and
then
they
turn
round
on
one
and
praise
as
if
they
wanted
to
sell
but
father
be
waiting
for
me
we
must
turn
now
the
large
gig
with
the
steady
old
grey
was
at
the
front
door
and
lammeter
was
already
on
the
stone
steps
passing
the
time
in
recalling
to
godfrey
what
very
fine
points
speckle
had
when
his
master
used
to
ride
him
i
always
have
a
good
horse
you
know
said
the
old
gentleman
not
liking
that
spirited
time
to
be
quite
effaced
from
the
memory
of
his
juniors
mind
you
bring
nancy
to
the
warrens
before
the
week
out
cass
was
priscilla
parting
injunction
as
she
took
the
reins
and
shook
them
gently
by
way
of
friendly
incitement
to
speckle
i
shall
just
take
a
turn
to
the
fields
against
the
nancy
and
look
at
the
draining
said
godfrey
you
be
in
again
by
dear
oh
yes
i
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
it
was
godfrey
custom
on
a
sunday
afternoon
to
do
a
little
contemplative
farming
in
a
leisurely
walk
nancy
seldom
accompanied
him
for
the
women
of
her
generation
unless
like
priscilla
they
took
to
outdoor
management
were
not
given
to
much
walking
beyond
their
own
house
and
garden
finding
sufficient
exercise
in
domestic
duties
so
when
priscilla
was
not
with
her
she
usually
sat
with
mant
bible
before
her
and
after
following
the
text
with
her
eyes
for
a
little
while
she
would
gradually
permit
them
to
wander
as
her
thoughts
had
already
insisted
on
wandering
but
nancy
sunday
thoughts
were
rarely
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
devout
and
reverential
intention
implied
by
the
book
spread
open
before
her
she
was
not
theologically
instructed
enough
to
discern
very
clearly
the
relation
between
the
sacred
documents
of
the
past
which
she
opened
without
method
and
her
own
obscure
simple
life
but
the
spirit
of
rectitude
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
effect
of
her
conduct
on
others
which
were
strong
elements
in
nancy
character
had
made
it
a
habit
with
her
to
scrutinize
her
past
feelings
and
actions
with
solicitude
her
mind
not
being
courted
by
a
great
variety
of
subjects
she
filled
the
vacant
moments
by
living
inwardly
again
and
again
through
all
her
remembered
experience
especially
through
the
fifteen
years
of
her
married
time
in
which
her
life
and
its
significance
had
been
doubled
she
recalled
the
small
details
the
words
tones
and
looks
in
the
critical
scenes
which
had
opened
a
new
epoch
for
her
by
giving
her
a
deeper
insight
into
the
relations
and
trials
of
life
or
which
had
called
on
her
for
some
little
effort
of
forbearance
or
of
painful
adherence
to
an
imagined
or
real
duty
asking
herself
continually
whether
she
had
been
in
any
respect
blamable
this
excessive
rumination
and
is
perhaps
a
morbid
habit
inevitable
to
a
mind
of
much
moral
sensibility
when
shut
out
from
its
due
share
of
outward
activity
and
of
practical
claims
on
its
affections
inevitable
to
a
childless
woman
when
her
lot
is
narrow
i
can
do
so
little
have
i
done
it
all
well
is
the
perpetually
recurring
thought
and
there
are
no
voices
calling
her
away
from
that
soliloquy
no
peremptory
demands
to
divert
energy
from
vain
regret
or
superfluous
scruple
there
was
one
main
thread
of
painful
experience
in
nancy
married
life
and
on
it
hung
certain
scenes
which
were
the
oftenest
revived
in
retrospect
the
short
dialogue
with
priscilla
in
the
garden
had
determined
the
current
of
retrospect
in
that
frequent
direction
this
particular
sunday
afternoon
the
first
wandering
of
her
thought
from
the
text
which
she
still
attempted
dutifully
to
follow
with
her
eyes
and
silent
lips
was
into
an
imaginary
enlargement
of
the
defence
she
had
set
up
for
her
husband
against
priscilla
implied
blame
the
vindication
of
the
loved
object
is
the
best
balm
affection
can
find
for
its
wounds
a
man
must
have
so
much
on
his
mind
is
the
belief
by
which
a
wife
often
supports
a
cheerful
face
under
rough
answers
and
unfeeling
words
and
nancy
deepest
wounds
had
all
come
from
the
perception
that
the
absence
of
children
from
their
hearth
was
dwelt
on
in
her
husband
mind
as
a
privation
to
which
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
yet
sweet
nancy
might
have
been
expected
to
feel
still
more
keenly
the
denial
of
a
blessing
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
with
all
the
varied
expectations
and
preparations
solemn
and
prettily
trivial
which
fill
the
mind
of
a
loving
woman
when
she
expects
to
become
a
mother
was
there
not
a
drawer
filled
with
the
neat
work
of
her
hands
all
unworn
and
untouched
just
as
she
had
arranged
it
there
fourteen
years
ago
just
but
for
one
little
dress
which
had
been
made
the
but
under
this
immediate
personal
trial
nancy
was
so
firmly
unmurmuring
that
years
ago
she
had
suddenly
renounced
the
habit
of
visiting
this
drawer
lest
she
should
in
this
way
be
cherishing
a
longing
for
what
was
not
given
perhaps
it
was
this
very
severity
towards
any
indulgence
of
what
she
held
to
be
sinful
regret
in
herself
that
made
her
shrink
from
applying
her
own
standard
to
her
husband
it
is
very
different
it
is
much
worse
for
a
man
to
be
disappointed
in
that
way
a
woman
can
always
be
satisfied
with
devoting
herself
to
her
husband
but
a
man
wants
something
that
will
make
him
look
forward
more
and
sitting
by
the
fire
is
so
much
duller
to
him
than
to
a
woman
and
always
when
nancy
reached
this
point
in
her
meditations
trying
with
predetermined
sympathy
to
see
everything
as
godfrey
saw
it
there
came
a
renewal
of
she
done
everything
in
her
power
to
lighten
godfrey
privation
had
she
really
been
right
in
the
resistance
which
had
cost
her
so
much
pain
six
years
ago
and
again
four
years
ago
the
resistance
to
her
husband
wish
that
they
should
adopt
a
child
adoption
was
more
remote
from
the
ideas
and
habits
of
that
time
than
of
our
own
still
nancy
had
her
opinion
on
it
it
was
as
necessary
to
her
mind
to
have
an
opinion
on
all
topics
not
exclusively
masculine
that
had
come
under
her
notice
as
for
her
to
have
a
precisely
marked
place
for
every
article
of
her
personal
property
and
her
opinions
were
always
principles
to
be
unwaveringly
acted
on
they
were
firm
not
because
of
their
basis
but
because
she
held
them
with
a
tenacity
inseparable
from
her
mental
action
on
all
the
duties
and
proprieties
of
life
from
filial
behaviour
to
the
arrangements
of
the
evening
toilette
pretty
nancy
lammeter
by
the
time
she
was
had
her
unalterable
little
code
and
had
formed
every
one
of
her
habits
in
strict
accordance
with
that
code
she
carried
these
decided
judgments
within
her
in
the
most
unobtrusive
way
they
rooted
themselves
in
her
mind
and
grew
there
as
quietly
as
grass
years
ago
we
know
she
insisted
on
dressing
like
priscilla
because
it
was
right
for
sisters
to
dress
alike
and
because
she
would
do
what
was
right
if
she
wore
a
gown
dyed
with
that
was
a
trivial
but
typical
instance
of
the
mode
in
which
nancy
life
was
regulated
it
was
one
of
those
rigid
principles
and
no
petty
egoistic
feeling
which
had
been
the
ground
of
nancy
difficult
resistance
to
her
husband
wish
to
adopt
a
child
because
children
of
your
own
had
been
denied
you
was
to
try
and
choose
your
lot
in
spite
of
providence
the
adopted
child
she
was
convinced
would
never
turn
out
well
and
would
be
a
curse
to
those
who
had
wilfully
and
rebelliously
sought
what
it
was
clear
that
for
some
high
reason
they
were
better
without
when
you
saw
a
thing
was
not
meant
to
be
said
nancy
it
was
a
bounden
duty
to
leave
off
so
much
as
wishing
for
it
and
so
far
perhaps
the
wisest
of
men
could
scarcely
make
more
than
a
verbal
improvement
in
her
principle
but
the
conditions
under
which
she
held
it
apparent
that
a
thing
was
not
meant
to
be
depended
on
a
more
peculiar
mode
of
thinking
she
would
have
given
up
making
a
purchase
at
a
particular
place
if
on
three
successive
times
rain
or
some
other
cause
of
heaven
sending
had
formed
an
obstacle
and
she
would
have
anticipated
a
broken
limb
or
other
heavy
misfortune
to
any
one
who
persisted
in
spite
of
such
indications
but
why
should
you
think
the
child
would
turn
out
ill
said
godfrey
in
his
remonstrances
she
has
thriven
as
well
as
child
can
do
with
the
weaver
and
adopted
her
there
is
such
a
pretty
little
girl
anywhere
else
in
the
parish
or
one
fitter
for
the
station
we
could
give
her
where
can
be
the
likelihood
of
her
being
a
curse
to
anybody
yes
my
dear
godfrey
said
nancy
who
was
sitting
with
her
hands
tightly
clasped
together
and
with
yearning
regretful
affection
in
her
eyes
the
child
may
not
turn
out
ill
with
the
weaver
but
then
he
did
go
to
seek
her
as
we
should
be
doing
it
will
be
wrong
i
feel
sure
it
will
do
you
remember
what
that
lady
we
met
at
the
royston
baths
told
us
about
the
child
her
sister
adopted
that
was
the
only
adopting
i
ever
heard
of
and
the
child
was
transported
when
it
was
dear
godfrey
do
ask
me
to
do
what
i
know
is
wrong
i
should
never
be
happy
again
i
know
it
very
hard
for
easier
for
me
but
it
the
will
of
providence
it
might
seem
singular
that
nancy
with
her
religious
theory
pieced
together
out
of
narrow
social
traditions
fragments
of
church
doctrine
imperfectly
understood
and
girlish
reasonings
on
her
small
experience
should
have
arrived
by
herself
at
a
way
of
thinking
so
nearly
akin
to
that
of
many
devout
people
whose
beliefs
are
held
in
the
shape
of
a
system
quite
remote
from
her
knowledge
singular
if
we
did
not
know
that
human
beliefs
like
all
other
natural
growths
elude
the
barriers
of
system
godfrey
had
from
the
first
specified
eppie
then
about
twelve
years
old
as
a
child
suitable
for
them
to
adopt
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
silas
would
rather
part
with
his
life
than
with
eppie
surely
the
weaver
would
wish
the
best
to
the
child
he
had
taken
so
much
trouble
with
and
would
be
glad
that
such
good
fortune
should
happen
to
her
she
would
always
be
very
grateful
to
him
and
he
would
be
well
provided
for
to
the
end
of
his
life
provided
for
as
the
excellent
part
he
had
done
by
the
child
deserved
was
it
not
an
appropriate
thing
for
people
in
a
higher
station
to
take
a
charge
off
the
hands
of
a
man
in
a
lower
it
seemed
an
eminently
appropriate
thing
to
godfrey
for
reasons
that
were
known
only
to
himself
and
by
a
common
fallacy
he
imagined
the
measure
would
be
easy
because
he
had
private
motives
for
desiring
it
this
was
rather
a
coarse
mode
of
estimating
relation
to
eppie
but
we
must
remember
that
many
of
the
impressions
which
godfrey
was
likely
to
gather
concerning
the
labouring
people
around
him
would
favour
the
idea
that
deep
affections
can
hardly
go
along
with
callous
palms
and
scant
means
and
he
had
not
had
the
opportunity
even
if
he
had
had
the
power
of
entering
intimately
into
all
that
was
exceptional
in
the
weaver
experience
it
was
only
the
want
of
adequate
knowledge
that
could
have
made
it
possible
for
godfrey
deliberately
to
entertain
an
unfeeling
project
his
natural
kindness
had
outlived
that
blighting
time
of
cruel
wishes
and
nancy
praise
of
him
as
a
husband
was
not
founded
entirely
on
a
wilful
illusion
i
was
right
she
said
to
herself
when
she
had
recalled
all
their
scenes
of
discussion
i
feel
i
was
right
to
say
him
nay
though
it
hurt
me
more
than
anything
but
how
good
godfrey
has
been
about
it
many
men
would
have
been
very
angry
with
me
for
standing
out
against
their
wishes
and
they
might
have
thrown
out
that
they
had
in
marrying
me
but
godfrey
has
never
been
the
man
to
say
me
an
unkind
word
it
only
what
he
ca
hide
everything
seems
so
blank
to
him
i
know
and
the
land
what
a
difference
it
make
to
him
when
he
goes
to
see
after
things
if
he
children
growing
up
that
he
was
doing
it
all
for
but
i
wo
murmur
and
perhaps
if
he
married
a
woman
who
have
had
children
she
have
vexed
him
in
other
ways
this
possibility
was
nancy
chief
comfort
and
to
give
it
greater
strength
she
laboured
to
make
it
impossible
that
any
other
wife
should
have
had
more
perfect
tenderness
she
had
been
to
vex
him
by
that
one
denial
godfrey
was
not
insensible
to
her
loving
effort
and
did
nancy
no
injustice
as
to
the
motives
of
her
obstinacy
it
was
impossible
to
have
lived
with
her
fifteen
years
and
not
be
aware
that
an
unselfish
clinging
to
the
right
and
a
sincerity
clear
as
the
dew
were
her
main
characteristics
indeed
godfrey
felt
this
so
strongly
that
his
own
more
wavering
nature
too
averse
to
facing
difficulty
to
be
unvaryingly
simple
and
truthful
was
kept
in
a
certain
awe
of
this
gentle
wife
who
watched
his
looks
with
a
yearning
to
obey
them
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
he
should
ever
confess
to
her
the
truth
about
eppie
she
would
never
recover
from
the
repulsion
the
story
of
his
earlier
marriage
would
create
told
to
her
now
after
that
long
concealment
and
the
child
too
he
thought
must
become
an
object
of
repulsion
the
very
sight
of
her
would
be
painful
the
shock
to
nancy
mingled
pride
and
ignorance
of
the
world
evil
might
even
be
too
much
for
her
delicate
frame
since
he
had
married
her
with
that
secret
on
his
heart
he
must
keep
it
there
to
the
last
whatever
else
he
did
he
could
not
make
an
irreparable
breach
between
himself
and
this
wife
meanwhile
why
could
he
not
make
up
his
mind
to
the
absence
of
children
from
a
hearth
brightened
by
such
a
wife
why
did
his
mind
fly
uneasily
to
that
void
as
if
it
were
the
sole
reason
why
life
was
not
thoroughly
joyous
to
him
i
suppose
it
is
the
way
with
all
men
and
women
who
reach
middle
age
without
the
clear
perception
that
life
never
be
thoroughly
joyous
under
the
vague
dullness
of
the
grey
hours
dissatisfaction
seeks
a
definite
object
and
finds
it
in
the
privation
of
an
untried
good
dissatisfaction
seated
musingly
on
a
childless
hearth
thinks
with
envy
of
the
father
whose
return
is
greeted
by
young
voices
seated
at
the
meal
where
the
little
heads
rise
one
above
another
like
nursery
plants
it
sees
a
black
care
hovering
behind
every
one
of
them
and
thinks
the
impulses
by
which
men
abandon
freedom
and
seek
for
ties
are
surely
nothing
but
a
brief
madness
in
case
there
were
further
reasons
why
his
thoughts
should
be
continually
solicited
by
this
one
point
in
his
lot
his
conscience
never
thoroughly
easy
about
eppie
now
gave
his
childless
home
the
aspect
of
a
retribution
and
as
the
time
passed
on
under
nancy
refusal
to
adopt
her
any
retrieval
of
his
error
became
more
and
more
difficult
on
this
sunday
afternoon
it
was
already
four
years
since
there
had
been
any
allusion
to
the
subject
between
them
and
nancy
supposed
that
it
was
for
ever
buried
i
wonder
if
he
mind
it
less
or
more
as
he
gets
older
she
thought
i
afraid
more
aged
people
feel
the
miss
of
children
what
would
father
do
without
priscilla
and
if
i
die
godfrey
will
be
very
lonely
not
holding
together
with
his
brothers
much
but
i
wo
be
and
trying
to
make
things
out
beforehand
i
must
do
my
best
for
the
present
with
that
last
thought
nancy
roused
herself
from
her
reverie
and
turned
her
eyes
again
towards
the
forsaken
page
it
had
been
forsaken
longer
than
she
imagined
for
she
was
presently
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
the
servant
with
the
it
was
in
fact
a
little
before
the
usual
time
for
tea
but
jane
had
her
reasons
is
your
master
come
into
the
yard
jane
no
he
is
said
jane
with
a
slight
emphasis
of
which
however
her
mistress
took
no
notice
i
do
know
whether
you
seen
continued
jane
after
a
pause
but
there
folks
making
haste
all
one
way
afore
the
front
window
i
doubt
something
happened
there
niver
a
man
to
be
seen
i
the
yard
else
i
send
and
see
i
been
up
into
the
top
attic
but
there
no
seeing
anything
for
trees
i
hope
nobody
hurt
all
oh
no
i
daresay
there
nothing
much
the
matter
said
nancy
perhaps
snell
bull
got
out
again
as
he
did
before
i
wish
he
may
gore
anybody
then
that
all
said
jane
not
altogether
despising
a
hypothesis
which
covered
a
few
imaginary
calamities
that
girl
is
always
terrifying
me
thought
nancy
i
wish
godfrey
would
come
in
she
went
to
the
front
window
and
looked
as
far
as
she
could
see
along
the
road
with
an
uneasiness
which
she
felt
to
be
childish
for
there
were
now
no
such
signs
of
excitement
as
jane
had
spoken
of
and
godfrey
would
not
be
likely
to
return
by
the
village
road
but
by
the
fields
she
continued
to
stand
however
looking
at
the
placid
churchyard
with
the
long
shadows
of
the
gravestones
across
the
bright
green
hillocks
and
at
the
glowing
autumn
colours
of
the
rectory
trees
beyond
before
such
calm
external
beauty
the
presence
of
a
vague
fear
is
more
distinctly
felt
like
a
raven
flapping
its
slow
wing
across
the
sunny
air
nancy
wished
more
and
more
that
godfrey
would
come
in
chapter
xviii
some
one
opened
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
nancy
felt
that
it
was
her
husband
she
turned
from
the
window
with
gladness
in
her
eyes
for
the
wife
chief
dread
was
stilled
dear
i
so
thankful
you
come
she
said
going
towards
him
i
began
to
get
she
paused
abruptly
for
godfrey
was
laying
down
his
hat
with
trembling
hands
and
turned
towards
her
with
a
pale
face
and
a
strange
unanswering
glance
as
if
he
saw
her
indeed
but
saw
her
as
part
of
a
scene
invisible
to
herself
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
not
daring
to
speak
again
but
he
left
the
touch
unnoticed
and
threw
himself
into
his
chair
jane
was
already
at
the
door
with
the
hissing
urn
tell
her
to
keep
away
will
you
said
godfrey
and
when
the
door
was
closed
again
he
exerted
himself
to
speak
more
distinctly
sit
down
nancy
there
he
said
pointing
to
a
chair
opposite
him
i
came
back
as
soon
as
i
could
to
hinder
anybody
telling
you
but
me
i
had
a
great
shock
but
i
care
most
about
the
shock
it
be
to
you
it
is
father
and
priscilla
said
nancy
with
quivering
lips
clasping
her
hands
together
tightly
on
her
lap
no
it
nobody
living
said
godfrey
unequal
to
the
considerate
skill
with
which
he
would
have
wished
to
make
his
revelation
dunstan
my
brother
dunstan
that
we
lost
sight
of
sixteen
years
ago
we
found
him
found
his
body
his
skeleton
the
deep
dread
godfrey
look
had
created
in
nancy
made
her
feel
these
words
a
relief
she
sat
in
comparative
calmness
to
hear
what
else
he
had
to
tell
he
went
on
the
has
gone
dry
suddenly
from
the
draining
i
suppose
and
there
he
lies
has
lain
for
sixteen
years
wedged
between
two
great
stones
there
his
watch
and
seals
and
there
my
with
my
name
on
he
took
it
away
without
my
knowing
the
day
he
went
hunting
on
wildfire
the
last
time
he
was
seen
godfrey
paused
it
was
not
so
easy
to
say
what
came
next
do
you
think
he
drowned
himself
said
nancy
almost
wondering
that
her
husband
should
be
so
deeply
shaken
by
what
had
happened
all
those
years
ago
to
an
unloved
brother
of
whom
worse
things
had
been
augured
no
he
fell
in
said
godfrey
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
as
if
he
felt
some
deep
meaning
in
the
fact
presently
he
added
dunstan
was
the
man
that
robbed
silas
marner
the
blood
rushed
to
nancy
face
and
neck
at
this
surprise
and
shame
for
she
had
been
bred
up
to
regard
even
a
distant
kinship
with
crime
as
a
dishonour
o
godfrey
she
said
with
compassion
in
her
tone
for
she
had
immediately
reflected
that
the
dishonour
must
be
felt
still
more
keenly
by
her
husband
there
was
the
money
in
the
pit
he
continued
all
the
money
everything
been
gathered
up
and
they
taking
the
skeleton
to
the
rainbow
but
i
came
back
to
tell
you
there
was
no
hindering
it
you
must
know
he
was
silent
looking
on
the
ground
for
two
long
minutes
nancy
would
have
said
some
words
of
comfort
under
this
disgrace
but
she
refrained
from
an
instinctive
sense
that
there
was
something
behind
that
godfrey
had
something
else
to
tell
her
presently
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
face
and
kept
them
fixed
on
her
as
he
said
everything
comes
to
light
nancy
sooner
or
later
when
god
almighty
wills
it
our
secrets
are
found
out
i
lived
with
a
secret
on
my
mind
but
i
keep
it
from
you
no
longer
i
would
have
you
know
it
by
somebody
else
and
not
by
me
i
would
have
you
find
it
out
after
i
dead
i
tell
you
now
it
been
i
will
and
i
wo
with
me
all
my
life
i
make
sure
of
myself
now
nancy
utmost
dread
had
returned
the
eyes
of
the
husband
and
wife
met
with
awe
in
them
as
at
a
crisis
which
suspended
affection
nancy
said
godfrey
slowly
when
i
married
you
i
hid
something
from
you
something
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
woman
marner
found
dead
in
the
snow
eppie
mother
that
wretched
woman
was
my
wife
eppie
is
my
child
he
paused
dreading
the
effect
of
his
confession
but
nancy
sat
quite
still
only
that
her
eyes
dropped
and
ceased
to
meet
his
she
was
pale
and
quiet
as
a
meditative
statue
clasping
her
hands
on
her
lap
you
never
think
the
same
of
me
again
said
godfrey
after
a
little
while
with
some
tremor
in
his
voice
she
was
silent
i
ought
to
have
left
the
child
unowned
i
ought
to
have
kept
it
from
you
but
i
could
bear
to
give
you
up
nancy
i
was
led
away
into
marrying
her
i
suffered
for
it
still
nancy
was
silent
looking
down
and
he
almost
expected
that
she
would
presently
get
up
and
say
she
would
go
to
her
father
how
could
she
have
any
mercy
for
faults
that
must
seem
so
black
to
her
with
her
simple
severe
notions
but
at
last
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
to
his
again
and
spoke
there
was
no
indignation
in
her
voice
only
deep
regret
godfrey
if
you
had
but
told
me
this
six
years
ago
we
could
have
done
some
of
our
duty
by
the
child
do
you
think
i
have
refused
to
take
her
in
if
i
known
she
was
yours
at
that
moment
godfrey
felt
all
the
bitterness
of
an
error
that
was
not
simply
futile
but
had
defeated
its
own
end
he
had
not
measured
this
wife
with
whom
he
had
lived
so
long
but
she
spoke
again
with
more
agitation
and
oh
godfrey
if
we
had
her
from
the
first
if
you
taken
to
her
as
you
ought
she
have
loved
me
for
her
mother
and
you
have
been
happier
with
me
i
could
better
have
bore
my
little
baby
dying
and
our
life
might
have
been
more
like
what
we
used
to
think
it
be
the
tears
fell
and
nancy
ceased
to
speak
but
you
would
have
married
me
then
nancy
if
i
told
you
said
godfrey
urged
in
the
bitterness
of
his
to
prove
to
himself
that
his
conduct
had
not
been
utter
folly
you
may
think
you
would
now
but
you
would
then
with
your
pride
and
your
father
you
have
hated
having
anything
to
do
with
me
after
the
talk
have
been
i
ca
say
what
i
should
have
done
about
that
godfrey
i
should
never
have
married
anybody
else
but
i
was
worth
doing
wrong
for
nothing
is
in
this
world
nothing
is
so
good
as
it
seems
beforehand
not
even
our
marrying
was
you
see
there
was
a
faint
sad
smile
on
nancy
face
as
she
said
the
last
words
i
a
worse
man
than
you
thought
i
was
nancy
said
godfrey
rather
tremulously
can
you
forgive
me
ever
the
wrong
to
me
is
but
little
godfrey
you
made
it
up
to
me
you
been
good
to
me
for
fifteen
years
it
another
you
did
the
wrong
to
and
i
doubt
it
can
never
be
all
made
up
for
but
we
can
take
eppie
now
said
godfrey
i
wo
mind
the
world
knowing
at
last
i
be
plain
and
open
for
the
rest
o
my
life
it
be
different
coming
to
us
now
she
grown
up
said
nancy
shaking
her
head
sadly
but
it
your
duty
to
acknowledge
her
and
provide
for
her
and
i
do
my
part
by
her
and
pray
to
god
almighty
to
make
her
love
me
then
we
go
together
to
silas
marner
this
very
night
as
soon
as
everything
quiet
at
the
chapter
xix
between
eight
and
nine
that
evening
eppie
and
silas
were
seated
alone
in
the
cottage
after
the
great
excitement
the
weaver
had
undergone
from
the
events
of
the
afternoon
he
had
felt
a
longing
for
this
quietude
and
had
even
begged
winthrop
and
aaron
who
had
naturally
lingered
behind
every
one
else
to
leave
him
alone
with
his
child
the
excitement
had
not
passed
away
it
had
only
reached
that
stage
when
the
keenness
of
the
susceptibility
makes
external
stimulus
intolerable
when
there
is
no
sense
of
weariness
but
rather
an
intensity
of
inward
life
under
which
sleep
is
an
impossibility
any
one
who
has
watched
such
moments
in
other
men
remembers
the
brightness
of
the
eyes
and
the
strange
definiteness
that
comes
over
coarse
features
from
that
transient
influence
it
is
as
if
a
new
fineness
of
ear
for
all
spiritual
voices
had
sent
vibrations
through
the
heavy
mortal
frame
as
if
beauty
born
of
murmuring
sound
had
passed
into
the
face
of
the
listener
silas
face
showed
that
sort
of
transfiguration
as
he
sat
in
his
and
looked
at
eppie
she
had
drawn
her
own
chair
towards
his
knees
and
leaned
forward
holding
both
his
hands
while
she
looked
up
at
him
on
the
table
near
them
lit
by
a
candle
lay
the
recovered
gold
the
old
gold
ranged
in
orderly
heaps
as
silas
used
to
range
it
in
the
days
when
it
was
his
only
joy
he
had
been
telling
her
how
he
used
to
count
it
every
night
and
how
his
soul
was
utterly
desolate
till
she
was
sent
to
him
at
first
i
a
sort
o
feeling
come
across
me
now
and
then
he
was
saying
in
a
subdued
tone
as
if
you
might
be
changed
into
the
gold
again
for
sometimes
turn
my
head
which
way
i
would
i
seemed
to
see
the
gold
and
i
thought
i
should
be
glad
if
i
could
feel
it
and
find
it
was
come
back
but
that
did
last
long
after
a
bit
i
should
have
thought
it
was
a
curse
come
again
if
it
had
drove
you
from
me
for
i
got
to
feel
the
need
o
your
looks
and
your
voice
and
the
touch
o
your
little
fingers
you
did
know
then
eppie
when
you
were
such
a
little
un
you
did
know
what
your
old
father
silas
felt
for
you
but
i
know
now
father
said
eppie
if
it
had
been
for
you
they
have
taken
me
to
the
workhouse
and
there
have
been
nobody
to
love
me
eh
my
precious
child
the
blessing
was
mine
if
you
had
been
sent
to
save
me
i
should
ha
gone
to
the
grave
in
my
misery
the
money
was
taken
away
from
me
in
time
and
you
see
it
been
kept
kept
till
it
was
wanted
for
you
it
wonderful
our
life
is
wonderful
silas
sat
in
silence
a
few
minutes
looking
at
the
money
it
takes
no
hold
of
me
now
he
said
ponderingly
the
money
does
i
wonder
if
it
ever
could
again
i
doubt
it
might
if
i
lost
you
eppie
i
might
come
to
think
i
was
forsaken
again
and
lose
the
feeling
that
god
was
good
to
me
at
that
moment
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
eppie
was
obliged
to
rise
without
answering
silas
beautiful
she
looked
with
the
tenderness
of
gathering
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
slight
flush
on
her
cheeks
as
she
stepped
to
open
the
door
the
flush
deepened
when
she
saw
and
godfrey
cass
she
made
her
little
rustic
curtsy
and
held
the
door
wide
for
them
to
enter
we
disturbing
you
very
late
my
dear
said
cass
taking
eppie
hand
and
looking
in
her
face
with
an
expression
of
anxious
interest
and
admiration
nancy
herself
was
pale
and
tremulous
eppie
after
placing
chairs
for
and
cass
went
to
stand
against
silas
opposite
to
them
well
marner
said
godfrey
trying
to
speak
with
perfect
firmness
it
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
see
you
with
your
money
again
that
you
been
deprived
of
so
many
years
it
was
one
of
my
family
did
you
the
wrong
the
more
grief
to
me
and
i
feel
bound
to
make
up
to
you
for
it
in
every
way
whatever
i
can
do
for
you
will
be
nothing
but
paying
a
debt
even
if
i
looked
no
further
than
the
robbery
but
there
are
other
things
i
beholden
shall
be
beholden
to
you
for
marner
godfrey
checked
himself
it
had
been
agreed
between
him
and
his
wife
that
the
subject
of
his
fatherhood
should
be
approached
very
carefully
and
that
if
possible
the
disclosure
should
be
reserved
for
the
future
so
that
it
might
be
made
to
eppie
gradually
nancy
had
urged
this
because
she
felt
strongly
the
painful
light
in
which
eppie
must
inevitably
see
the
relation
between
her
father
and
mother
silas
always
ill
at
ease
when
he
was
being
spoken
to
by
betters
such
as
cass
tall
powerful
florid
men
seen
chiefly
on
horseback
answered
with
some
constraint
sir
i
a
deal
to
thank
you
for
as
for
the
robbery
i
count
it
no
loss
to
me
and
if
i
did
you
could
help
it
you
answerable
for
it
you
may
look
at
it
in
that
way
marner
but
i
never
can
and
i
hope
you
let
me
act
according
to
my
own
feeling
of
what
just
i
know
you
easily
contented
you
been
a
man
all
your
life
yes
sir
yes
said
marner
meditatively
i
should
ha
been
bad
off
without
my
work
it
was
what
i
held
by
when
everything
else
was
gone
from
me
ah
said
godfrey
applying
marner
words
simply
to
his
bodily
wants
it
was
a
good
trade
for
you
in
this
country
because
there
been
a
great
deal
of
to
be
done
but
you
getting
rather
past
such
close
work
marner
it
time
you
laid
by
and
had
some
rest
you
look
a
good
deal
pulled
down
though
you
not
an
old
man
you
as
near
as
i
can
say
sir
said
silas
oh
why
you
may
live
thirty
years
longer
look
at
old
macey
and
that
money
on
the
table
after
all
is
but
little
it
wo
go
far
either
way
whether
it
put
out
to
interest
or
you
were
to
live
on
it
as
long
as
it
would
last
it
would
go
far
if
you
nobody
to
keep
but
yourself
and
you
had
two
to
keep
for
a
good
many
years
now
eh
sir
said
silas
unaffected
by
anything
godfrey
was
saying
in
no
fear
o
want
we
shall
do
very
well
eppie
and
me
do
well
enough
there
few
have
got
so
much
laid
by
as
that
i
do
know
what
it
is
to
gentlefolks
but
i
look
upon
it
as
a
deal
almost
too
much
and
as
for
us
it
little
we
want
only
the
garden
father
said
eppie
blushing
up
to
the
ears
the
moment
after
you
love
a
garden
do
you
my
dear
said
nancy
thinking
that
this
turn
in
the
point
of
view
might
help
her
husband
we
should
agree
in
that
i
give
a
deal
of
time
to
the
garden
ah
there
plenty
of
gardening
at
the
red
house
said
godfrey
surprised
at
the
difficulty
he
found
in
approaching
a
proposition
which
had
seemed
so
easy
to
him
in
the
distance
you
done
a
good
part
by
eppie
marner
for
sixteen
years
it
be
a
great
comfort
to
you
to
see
her
well
provided
for
would
it
she
looks
blooming
and
healthy
but
not
fit
for
any
hardships
she
does
look
like
a
strapping
girl
come
of
working
parents
you
like
to
see
her
taken
care
of
by
those
who
can
leave
her
well
off
and
make
a
lady
of
her
she
more
fit
for
it
than
for
a
rough
life
such
as
she
might
come
to
have
in
a
few
years
time
a
slight
flush
came
over
marner
face
and
disappeared
like
a
passing
gleam
eppie
was
simply
wondering
cass
should
talk
so
about
things
that
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
reality
but
silas
was
hurt
and
uneasy
i
do
take
your
meaning
sir
he
answered
not
having
words
at
command
to
express
the
mingled
feelings
with
which
he
had
heard
cass
words
well
my
meaning
is
this
marner
said
godfrey
determined
to
come
to
the
point
cass
and
i
you
know
have
no
children
nobody
to
benefit
by
our
good
home
and
everything
else
we
have
more
than
enough
for
ourselves
and
we
should
like
to
have
somebody
in
the
place
of
a
daughter
to
us
we
should
like
to
have
eppie
and
treat
her
in
every
way
as
our
own
child
it
be
a
great
comfort
to
you
in
your
old
age
i
hope
to
see
her
fortune
made
in
that
way
after
you
been
at
the
trouble
of
bringing
her
up
so
well
and
it
right
you
should
have
every
reward
for
that
and
eppie
i
sure
will
always
love
you
and
be
grateful
to
you
she
come
and
see
you
very
often
and
we
should
all
be
on
the
to
do
everything
we
could
towards
making
you
comfortable
a
plain
man
like
godfrey
cass
speaking
under
some
embarrassment
necessarily
blunders
on
words
that
are
coarser
than
his
intentions
and
that
are
likely
to
fall
gratingly
on
susceptible
feelings
while
he
had
been
speaking
eppie
had
quietly
passed
her
arm
behind
silas
head
and
let
her
hand
rest
against
it
caressingly
she
felt
him
trembling
violently
he
was
silent
for
some
moments
when
cass
had
ended
powerless
under
the
conflict
of
emotions
all
alike
painful
eppie
heart
was
swelling
at
the
sense
that
her
father
was
in
distress
and
she
was
just
going
to
lean
down
and
speak
to
him
when
one
struggling
dread
at
last
gained
the
mastery
over
every
other
in
silas
and
he
said
faintly
eppie
my
child
speak
i
wo
stand
in
your
way
thank
and
mrs
cass
eppie
took
her
hand
from
her
father
head
and
came
forward
a
step
her
cheeks
were
flushed
but
not
with
shyness
this
time
the
sense
that
her
father
was
in
doubt
and
suffering
banished
that
sort
of
she
dropped
a
low
curtsy
first
to
cass
and
then
to
cass
and
said
thank
you
thank
you
sir
but
i
ca
leave
my
father
nor
own
anybody
nearer
than
him
and
i
do
want
to
be
a
lady
thank
you
all
the
same
here
eppie
dropped
another
curtsy
i
could
give
up
the
folks
i
been
used
to
eppie
lips
began
to
tremble
a
little
at
the
last
words
she
retreated
to
her
father
chair
again
and
held
him
round
the
neck
while
silas
with
a
subdued
sob
put
up
his
hand
to
grasp
hers
the
tears
were
in
nancy
eyes
but
her
sympathy
with
eppie
was
naturally
divided
with
distress
on
her
husband
account
she
dared
not
speak
wondering
what
was
going
on
in
her
husband
mind
godfrey
felt
an
irritation
inevitable
to
almost
all
of
us
when
we
encounter
an
unexpected
obstacle
he
had
been
full
of
his
own
penitence
and
resolution
to
retrieve
his
error
as
far
as
the
time
was
left
to
him
he
was
possessed
with
feelings
that
were
to
lead
to
a
predetermined
course
of
action
which
he
had
fixed
on
as
the
right
and
he
was
not
prepared
to
enter
with
lively
appreciation
into
other
people
feelings
counteracting
his
virtuous
resolves
the
agitation
with
which
he
spoke
again
was
not
quite
unmixed
with
anger
but
i
a
claim
on
you
eppie
the
strongest
of
all
claims
it
my
duty
marner
to
own
eppie
as
my
child
and
provide
for
her
she
is
my
own
child
her
mother
was
my
wife
i
a
natural
claim
on
her
that
must
stand
before
every
other
eppie
had
given
a
violent
start
and
turned
quite
pale
silas
on
the
contrary
who
had
been
relieved
by
eppie
answer
from
the
dread
lest
his
mind
should
be
in
opposition
to
hers
felt
the
spirit
of
resistance
in
him
set
free
not
without
a
touch
of
parental
fierceness
then
sir
he
answered
with
an
accent
of
bitterness
that
had
been
silent
in
him
since
the
memorable
day
when
his
youthful
hope
had
perished
then
sir
why
did
you
say
so
sixteen
year
ago
and
claim
her
before
come
to
love
her
o
coming
to
take
her
from
me
now
when
you
might
as
well
take
the
heart
out
o
my
body
god
gave
her
to
me
because
you
turned
your
back
upon
her
and
he
looks
upon
her
as
mine
you
no
right
to
her
when
a
man
turns
a
blessing
from
his
door
it
falls
to
them
as
take
it
in
i
know
that
marner
i
was
wrong
i
repented
of
my
conduct
in
that
matter
said
godfrey
who
could
not
help
feeling
the
edge
of
silas
words
i
glad
to
hear
it
sir
said
marner
with
gathering
excitement
but
repentance
does
alter
what
been
going
on
for
sixteen
year
your
coming
now
and
saying
i
her
father
does
alter
the
feelings
inside
us
it
me
she
been
calling
her
father
ever
since
she
could
say
the
word
but
i
think
you
might
look
at
the
thing
more
reasonably
marner
said
godfrey
unexpectedly
awed
by
the
weaver
direct
it
is
as
if
she
was
to
be
taken
quite
away
from
you
so
that
never
see
her
again
she
be
very
near
you
and
come
to
see
you
very
often
she
feel
just
the
same
towards
you
just
the
same
said
marner
more
bitterly
than
ever
how
she
feel
just
the
same
for
me
as
she
does
now
when
we
eat
o
the
same
bit
and
drink
o
the
same
cup
and
think
o
the
same
things
from
one
end
to
another
just
the
same
that
idle
talk
you
cut
us
i
two
godfrey
unqualified
by
experience
to
discern
the
pregnancy
of
simple
words
felt
rather
angry
again
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
weaver
was
very
selfish
a
judgment
readily
passed
by
those
who
have
never
tested
their
own
power
of
sacrifice
to
oppose
what
was
undoubtedly
for
eppie
welfare
and
he
felt
himself
called
upon
for
her
sake
to
assert
his
authority
i
should
have
thought
marner
he
said
severely
i
should
have
thought
your
affection
for
eppie
would
make
you
rejoice
in
what
was
for
her
good
even
if
it
did
call
upon
you
to
give
up
something
you
ought
to
remember
your
own
life
uncertain
and
she
at
an
age
now
when
her
lot
may
soon
be
fixed
in
a
way
very
different
from
what
it
would
be
in
her
father
home
she
may
marry
some
low
and
then
whatever
i
might
do
for
her
i
could
make
her
putting
yourself
in
the
way
of
her
welfare
and
though
i
sorry
to
hurt
you
after
what
you
done
and
what
i
left
undone
i
feel
now
it
my
duty
to
insist
on
taking
care
of
my
own
daughter
i
want
to
do
my
duty
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
it
were
silas
or
eppie
that
was
more
deeply
stirred
by
this
last
speech
of
godfrey
thought
had
been
very
busy
in
eppie
as
she
listened
to
the
contest
between
her
old
father
and
this
new
unfamiliar
father
who
had
suddenly
come
to
fill
the
place
of
that
black
featureless
shadow
which
had
held
the
ring
and
placed
it
on
her
mother
finger
her
imagination
had
darted
backward
in
conjectures
and
forward
in
previsions
of
what
this
revealed
fatherhood
implied
and
there
were
words
in
godfrey
last
speech
which
helped
to
make
the
previsions
especially
definite
not
that
these
thoughts
either
of
past
or
future
determined
her
resolution
was
determined
by
the
feelings
which
vibrated
to
every
word
silas
had
uttered
but
they
raised
even
apart
from
these
feelings
a
repulsion
towards
the
offered
lot
and
the
father
silas
on
the
other
hand
was
again
stricken
in
conscience
and
alarmed
lest
godfrey
accusation
should
be
true
lest
he
should
be
raising
his
own
will
as
an
obstacle
to
eppie
good
for
many
moments
he
was
mute
struggling
for
the
necessary
to
the
uttering
of
the
difficult
words
they
came
out
tremulously
i
say
no
more
let
it
be
as
you
will
speak
to
the
child
hinder
nothing
even
nancy
with
all
the
acute
sensibility
of
her
own
affections
shared
her
husband
view
that
marner
was
not
justifiable
in
his
wish
to
retain
eppie
after
her
real
father
had
avowed
himself
she
felt
that
it
was
a
very
hard
trial
for
the
poor
weaver
but
her
code
allowed
no
question
that
a
father
by
blood
must
have
a
claim
above
that
of
any
besides
nancy
used
all
her
life
to
plenteous
circumstances
and
the
privileges
of
respectability
could
not
enter
into
the
pleasures
which
early
nurture
and
habit
connect
with
all
the
little
aims
and
efforts
of
the
poor
who
are
born
poor
to
her
mind
eppie
in
being
restored
to
her
birthright
was
entering
on
a
too
long
withheld
but
unquestionable
good
hence
she
heard
silas
last
words
with
relief
and
thought
as
godfrey
did
that
their
wish
was
achieved
eppie
my
dear
said
godfrey
looking
at
his
daughter
not
without
some
embarrassment
under
the
sense
that
she
was
old
enough
to
judge
him
it
always
be
our
wish
that
you
should
show
your
love
and
gratitude
to
one
who
been
a
father
to
you
so
many
years
and
we
shall
want
to
help
you
to
make
him
comfortable
in
every
way
but
we
hope
you
come
to
love
us
as
well
and
though
i
have
been
what
a
father
should
ha
been
to
you
all
these
years
i
wish
to
do
the
utmost
in
my
power
for
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
provide
for
you
as
my
only
child
and
you
have
the
best
of
mothers
in
my
wife
that
be
a
blessing
you
have
known
since
you
were
old
enough
to
know
it
my
dear
you
be
a
treasure
to
me
said
nancy
in
her
gentle
voice
we
shall
want
for
nothing
when
we
have
our
daughter
eppie
did
not
come
forward
and
curtsy
as
she
had
done
before
she
held
silas
hand
in
hers
and
grasped
it
firmly
it
was
a
hand
with
a
palm
and
that
were
sensitive
to
such
pressure
while
she
spoke
with
colder
decision
than
before
thank
you
thank
you
sir
for
your
offers
they
very
great
and
far
above
my
wish
for
i
should
have
no
delight
i
life
any
more
if
i
was
forced
to
go
away
from
my
father
and
knew
he
was
sitting
at
home
of
me
and
feeling
lone
we
been
used
to
be
happy
together
every
day
and
i
ca
think
o
no
happiness
without
him
and
he
says
he
nobody
i
the
world
till
i
was
sent
to
him
and
he
have
nothing
when
i
was
gone
and
he
took
care
of
me
and
loved
me
from
the
first
and
i
cleave
to
him
as
long
as
he
lives
and
nobody
shall
ever
come
between
him
and
me
but
you
must
make
sure
eppie
said
silas
in
a
low
voice
you
must
make
sure
as
you
wo
ever
be
sorry
because
you
made
your
choice
to
stay
among
poor
folks
and
with
poor
clothes
and
things
when
you
might
ha
had
everything
o
the
best
his
sensitiveness
on
this
point
had
increased
as
he
listened
to
words
of
faithful
affection
i
can
never
be
sorry
father
said
eppie
i
should
know
what
to
think
on
or
to
wish
for
with
fine
things
about
me
as
i
have
been
used
to
and
it
be
poor
work
for
me
to
put
on
things
and
ride
in
a
gig
and
sit
in
a
place
at
church
as
make
them
as
i
fond
of
think
me
unfitting
company
for
what
could
care
for
then
nancy
looked
at
godfrey
with
a
pained
questioning
glance
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
floor
where
he
was
moving
the
end
of
his
stick
as
if
he
were
pondering
on
something
absently
she
thought
there
was
a
word
which
might
perhaps
come
better
from
her
lips
than
from
his
what
you
say
is
natural
my
dear
child
it
natural
you
should
cling
to
those
who
brought
you
up
she
said
mildly
but
there
a
duty
you
owe
to
your
lawful
father
there
perhaps
something
to
be
given
up
on
more
sides
than
one
when
your
father
opens
his
home
to
you
i
think
it
right
you
should
turn
your
back
on
it
i
ca
feel
as
i
got
any
father
but
one
said
eppie
impetuously
while
the
tears
gathered
i
always
thought
of
a
little
home
where
he
sit
i
the
corner
and
i
should
fend
and
do
everything
for
him
i
ca
think
o
no
other
home
i
was
brought
up
to
be
a
lady
and
i
ca
turn
my
mind
to
it
i
like
the
and
their
victuals
and
their
ways
and
she
ended
passionately
while
the
tears
fell
i
promised
to
marry
a
as
live
with
father
and
help
me
to
take
care
of
him
godfrey
looked
up
at
nancy
with
a
flushed
face
and
smarting
dilated
eyes
this
frustration
of
a
purpose
towards
which
he
had
set
out
under
the
exalted
consciousness
that
he
was
about
to
compensate
in
some
degree
for
the
greatest
demerit
of
his
life
made
him
feel
the
air
of
the
room
stifling
let
us
go
he
said
in
an
we
wo
talk
of
this
any
longer
now
said
nancy
rising
we
your
my
dear
and
yours
too
marner
we
shall
come
and
see
you
again
it
getting
late
now
in
this
way
she
covered
her
husband
abrupt
departure
for
godfrey
had
gone
straight
to
the
door
unable
to
say

chapter
xx
nancy
and
godfrey
walked
home
under
the
starlight
in
silence
when
they
entered
the
oaken
parlour
godfrey
threw
himself
into
his
chair
while
nancy
laid
down
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
stood
on
the
hearth
near
her
husband
unwilling
to
leave
him
even
for
a
few
minutes
and
yet
fearing
to
utter
any
word
lest
it
might
jar
on
his
feeling
at
last
godfrey
turned
his
head
towards
her
and
their
eyes
met
dwelling
in
that
meeting
without
any
movement
on
either
side
that
quiet
mutual
gaze
of
a
trusting
husband
and
wife
is
like
the
first
moment
of
rest
or
refuge
from
a
great
weariness
or
a
great
danger
not
to
be
interfered
with
by
speech
or
action
which
would
distract
the
sensations
from
the
fresh
enjoyment
of
repose
but
presently
he
put
out
his
hand
and
as
nancy
placed
hers
within
it
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
said
that
ended
she
bent
to
kiss
him
and
then
said
as
she
stood
by
his
side
yes
i
afraid
we
must
give
up
the
hope
of
having
her
for
a
daughter
it
would
be
right
to
want
to
force
her
to
come
to
us
against
her
will
we
ca
alter
her
bringing
up
and
what
come
of
it
no
said
godfrey
with
a
keen
decisiveness
of
tone
in
contrast
with
his
usually
careless
and
unemphatic
speech
there
debts
we
ca
pay
like
money
debts
by
paying
extra
for
the
years
that
have
slipped
by
while
i
been
putting
off
and
putting
off
the
trees
have
been
growing
it
too
late
now
marner
was
in
the
right
in
what
he
said
about
a
man
turning
away
a
blessing
from
his
door
it
falls
to
somebody
else
i
wanted
to
pass
for
childless
once
nancy
i
shall
pass
for
childless
now
against
my
wish
nancy
did
not
speak
immediately
but
after
a
little
while
she
asked
you
wo
make
it
known
then
about
eppie
being
your
daughter
no
where
would
be
the
good
to
anybody
only
harm
i
must
do
what
i
can
for
her
in
the
state
of
life
she
chooses
i
must
see
who
it
is
she
thinking
of
marrying
if
it
wo
do
any
good
to
make
the
thing
known
said
nancy
who
thought
she
might
now
allow
herself
the
relief
of
entertaining
a
feeling
which
she
had
tried
to
silence
before
i
should
be
very
thankful
for
father
and
priscilla
never
to
be
troubled
with
knowing
what
was
done
in
the
past
more
than
about
dunsey
it
ca
be
helped
their
knowing
that
i
shall
put
it
in
my
will
i
think
i
shall
put
it
in
my
will
i
should
like
to
leave
anything
to
be
found
out
like
this
of
dunsey
said
godfrey
meditatively
but
i
ca
see
anything
but
difficulties
that
come
from
telling
it
now
i
must
do
what
i
can
to
make
her
happy
in
her
own
way
i
a
notion
he
added
after
a
pause
it
aaron
winthrop
she
meant
she
was
engaged
to
i
remember
seeing
him
with
her
and
marner
going
away
from
church
well
he
very
sober
and
industrious
said
nancy
trying
to
view
the
matter
as
cheerfully
as
possible
godfrey
fell
into
thoughtfulness
again
presently
he
looked
up
at
nancy
sorrowfully
and
said
she
a
very
pretty
nice
girl
is
she
nancy
yes
dear
and
with
just
your
hair
and
eyes
i
wondered
it
had
never
struck
me
before
i
think
she
took
a
dislike
to
me
at
the
thought
of
my
being
her
father
i
could
see
a
change
in
her
manner
after
that
she
could
bear
to
think
of
not
looking
on
marner
as
her
father
said
nancy
not
wishing
to
confirm
her
husband
painful
impression
she
thinks
i
did
wrong
by
her
mother
as
well
as
by
her
she
thinks
me
worse
than
i
am
but
she
think
it
she
can
never
know
all
it
part
of
my
punishment
nancy
for
my
daughter
to
dislike
me
i
should
never
have
got
into
that
trouble
if
i
been
true
to
you
if
i
had
been
a
fool
i
no
right
to
expect
anything
but
evil
could
come
of
that
marriage
and
when
i
shirked
doing
a
father
part
too
nancy
was
silent
her
spirit
of
rectitude
would
not
let
her
try
to
soften
the
edge
of
what
she
felt
to
be
a
just
compunction
he
spoke
again
after
a
little
while
but
the
tone
was
rather
changed
there
was
tenderness
mingled
with
the
previous
and
i
got
nancy
in
spite
of
all
and
yet
i
been
grumbling
and
uneasy
because
i
had
something
else
as
if
i
deserved
it
you
never
been
wanting
to
me
godfrey
said
nancy
with
quiet
sincerity
my
only
trouble
would
be
gone
if
you
resigned
yourself
to
the
lot
that
been
given
us
well
perhaps
it
is
too
late
to
mend
a
bit
there
though
it
too
late
to
mend
some
things
say
what
they
will
chapter
xxi
the
next
morning
when
silas
and
eppie
were
seated
at
their
breakfast
he
said
to
her
eppie
there
a
thing
i
had
on
my
mind
to
do
this
two
year
and
now
the
money
been
brought
back
to
us
we
can
do
it
i
been
turning
it
over
and
over
in
the
night
and
i
think
we
set
out
while
the
fine
days
last
we
leave
the
house
and
everything
for
your
godmother
to
take
care
on
and
we
make
a
little
bundle
o
things
and
set
out
where
to
go
daddy
said
eppie
in
much
surprise
to
my
old
country
to
the
town
where
i
was
born
up
lantern
yard
i
want
to
see
paston
the
minister
something
may
ha
come
out
to
make
know
i
was
innicent
o
the
robbery
and
paston
was
a
man
with
a
deal
o
light
i
want
to
speak
to
him
about
the
drawing
o
the
lots
and
i
should
like
to
talk
to
him
about
the
religion
o
this
for
i
partly
think
he
does
know
on
it
eppie
was
very
joyful
for
there
was
the
prospect
not
only
of
wonder
and
delight
at
seeing
a
strange
country
but
also
of
coming
back
to
tell
aaron
all
about
it
aaron
was
so
much
wiser
than
she
was
about
most
things
it
would
be
rather
pleasant
to
have
this
little
advantage
over
him
winthrop
though
possessed
with
a
dim
fear
of
dangers
attendant
on
so
long
a
journey
and
requiring
many
assurances
that
it
would
not
take
them
out
of
the
region
of
carriers
carts
and
slow
waggons
was
nevertheless
well
pleased
that
silas
should
revisit
his
own
country
and
find
out
if
he
had
been
cleared
from
that
false
accusation
you
be
easier
in
your
mind
for
the
rest
o
your
life
master
marner
said
dolly
that
you
would
and
if
there
any
light
to
be
got
up
the
yard
as
you
talk
on
we
need
of
it
i
this
world
and
be
glad
on
it
myself
if
you
could
bring
it
back
so
on
the
fourth
day
from
that
time
silas
and
eppie
in
their
sunday
clothes
with
a
small
bundle
tied
in
a
blue
linen
handkerchief
were
making
their
way
through
the
streets
of
a
great
manufacturing
town
silas
bewildered
by
the
changes
thirty
years
had
brought
over
his
native
place
had
stopped
several
persons
in
succession
to
ask
them
the
name
of
this
town
that
he
might
be
sure
he
was
not
under
a
mistake
about
it
ask
for
lantern
yard
father
ask
this
gentleman
with
the
tassels
on
his
shoulders
at
the
shop
door
he
is
in
a
hurry
like
the
rest
said
eppie
in
some
distress
at
her
father
bewilderment
and
ill
at
ease
besides
amidst
the
noise
the
movement
and
the
multitude
of
strange
indifferent
faces
eh
my
child
he
wo
know
anything
about
it
said
silas
gentlefolks
did
ever
go
up
the
yard
but
happen
somebody
can
tell
me
which
is
the
way
to
prison
street
where
the
jail
is
i
know
the
way
out
o
that
as
if
i
seen
it
yesterday
with
some
difficulty
after
many
turnings
and
new
inquiries
they
reached
prison
street
and
the
grim
walls
of
the
jail
the
first
object
that
answered
to
any
image
in
silas
memory
cheered
him
with
the
certitude
which
no
assurance
of
the
town
name
had
hitherto
given
him
that
he
was
in
his
native
place
ah
he
said
drawing
a
long
breath
there
the
jail
eppie
just
the
same
i
are
afraid
now
it
the
third
turning
on
the
left
hand
from
the
jail
doors
that
the
way
we
must
go
oh
what
a
dark
ugly
place
said
eppie
how
it
hides
the
sky
it
worse
than
the
workhouse
i
glad
you
do
live
in
this
town
now
father
is
lantern
yard
like
this
street
my
precious
child
said
silas
smiling
it
is
a
big
street
like
this
i
never
was
easy
i
this
street
myself
but
i
was
fond
lantern
yard
the
shops
here
are
all
altered
i
think
i
ca
make
out
but
i
shall
know
the
turning
because
it
the
third
here
it
is
he
said
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
as
they
came
to
a
narrow
alley
and
then
we
must
go
to
the
left
again
and
then
straight
for
a
bit
up
shoe
lane
and
then
we
shall
be
at
the
entry
next
to
the
window
where
there
the
nick
in
the
road
for
the
water
to
run
eh
i
can
see
it
all
o
father
i
like
as
if
i
was
stifled
said
eppie
i
could
thought
as
any
folks
lived
i
this
way
so
close
together
how
pretty
the
look
when
we
get
back
it
looks
comical
to
child
now
and
smells
bad
i
ca
think
as
it
usened
to
smell
so
here
and
there
a
sallow
begrimed
face
looked
out
from
a
gloomy
doorway
at
the
strangers
and
increased
eppie
uneasiness
so
that
it
was
a
relief
when
they
issued
from
the
alleys
into
shoe
lane
where
there
was
a
broader
strip
of
sky
dear
heart
said
silas
why
there
people
coming
out
o
the
yard
as
if
they
been
to
chapel
at
this
time
o
day
a
weekday
noon
suddenly
he
started
and
stood
still
with
a
look
of
distressed
amazement
that
alarmed
eppie
they
were
before
an
opening
in
front
of
a
large
factory
from
which
men
and
women
were
streaming
for
their
midday
meal
father
said
eppie
clasping
his
arm
what
the
matter
but
she
had
to
speak
again
and
again
before
silas
could
answer
her
it
gone
child
he
said
at
last
in
strong
agitation
lantern
yard
gone
it
must
ha
been
here
because
here
the
house
with
the
window
i
know
that
it
just
the
same
but
they
made
this
new
opening
and
see
that
big
factory
it
all
gone
chapel
and
all
come
into
that
little
and
sit
down
father
they
let
you
sit
down
said
eppie
always
on
the
watch
lest
one
of
her
strange
attacks
should
come
on
perhaps
the
people
can
tell
you
all
about
it
but
neither
from
the
who
had
come
to
shoe
lane
only
ten
years
ago
when
the
factory
was
already
built
nor
from
any
other
source
within
his
reach
could
silas
learn
anything
of
the
old
lantern
yard
friends
or
of
paston
the
minister
the
old
place
is
all
swep
away
silas
said
to
dolly
winthrop
on
the
night
of
his
return
the
little
graveyard
and
everything
the
old
home
gone
i
no
home
but
this
now
i
shall
never
know
whether
they
got
at
the
truth
o
the
robbery
nor
whether
paston
could
given
me
any
light
about
the
drawing
o
the
lots
it
dark
to
me
winthrop
that
is
i
doubt
it
be
dark
to
the
last
well
yes
master
marner
said
dolly
who
sat
with
a
placid
listening
face
now
bordered
by
grey
hairs
i
doubt
it
may
it
the
will
them
above
as
a
many
things
should
be
dark
to
us
but
there
some
things
as
i
never
felt
i
the
dark
about
and
they
mostly
what
comes
i
the
day
work
you
were
hard
done
by
that
once
master
marner
and
it
seems
as
you
never
know
the
rights
of
it
but
that
does
hinder
there
a
rights
master
marner
for
all
it
dark
to
you
and
me
no
said
silas
no
that
does
hinder
since
the
time
the
child
was
sent
to
me
and
i
come
to
love
her
as
myself
i
had
light
enough
to
trusten
by
and
now
she
says
she
never
leave
me
i
think
i
shall
trusten
till
i
die
conclusion
there
was
one
time
of
the
year
which
was
held
in
raveloe
to
be
especially
suitable
for
a
wedding
it
was
when
the
great
lilacs
and
laburnums
in
the
gardens
showed
their
golden
and
purple
wealth
above
the
walls
and
when
there
were
calves
still
young
enough
to
want
bucketfuls
of
fragrant
milk
people
were
not
so
busy
then
as
they
must
become
when
the
full
and
the
mowing
had
set
in
and
besides
it
was
a
time
when
a
light
bridal
dress
could
be
worn
with
comfort
and
seen
to
advantage
happily
the
sunshine
fell
more
warmly
than
usual
on
the
lilac
tufts
the
morning
that
eppie
was
married
for
her
dress
was
a
very
light
one
she
had
often
thought
though
with
a
feeling
of
renunciation
that
the
perfection
of
a
would
be
a
white
cotton
with
the
tiniest
pink
sprig
at
wide
intervals
so
that
when
godfrey
cass
begged
to
provide
one
and
asked
eppie
to
choose
what
it
should
be
previous
meditation
had
enabled
her
to
give
a
decided
answer
at
once
seen
at
a
little
distance
as
she
walked
across
the
churchyard
and
down
the
village
she
seemed
to
be
attired
in
pure
white
and
her
hair
looked
like
the
dash
of
gold
on
a
lily
one
hand
was
on
her
arm
and
with
the
other
she
clasped
the
hand
of
her
father
silas
you
wo
be
giving
me
away
father
she
had
said
before
they
went
to
church
you
only
be
taking
aaron
to
be
a
son
to
you
dolly
winthrop
walked
behind
with
her
husband
and
there
ended
the
little
bridal
procession
there
were
many
eyes
to
look
at
it
and
miss
priscilla
lammeter
was
glad
that
she
and
her
father
had
happened
to
drive
up
to
the
door
of
the
red
house
just
in
time
to
see
this
pretty
sight
they
had
come
to
keep
nancy
company
because
cass
had
had
to
go
away
to
lytherley
for
special
reasons
that
seemed
to
be
a
pity
for
otherwise
he
might
have
gone
as
crackenthorp
and
osgood
certainly
would
to
look
on
at
the
which
he
had
ordered
at
the
rainbow
naturally
feeling
a
great
interest
in
the
weaver
who
had
been
wronged
by
one
of
his
own
family
i
could
ha
wished
nancy
had
had
the
luck
to
find
a
child
like
that
and
bring
her
up
said
priscilla
to
her
father
as
they
sat
in
the
gig
i
should
ha
had
something
young
to
think
of
then
besides
the
lambs
and
the
calves
yes
my
dear
yes
said
lammeter
one
feels
that
as
one
gets
older
things
look
dim
to
old
folks
they
need
have
some
young
eyes
about
to
let
know
the
world
the
same
as
it
used
to
be
nancy
came
out
now
to
welcome
her
father
and
sister
and
the
wedding
group
had
passed
on
beyond
the
red
house
to
the
humbler
part
of
the
village
dolly
winthrop
was
the
first
to
divine
that
old
macey
who
had
been
set
in
his
outside
his
own
door
would
expect
some
special
notice
as
they
passed
since
he
was
too
old
to
be
at
the
macey
looking
for
a
word
from
us
said
dolly
he
be
hurt
if
we
pass
him
and
say
nothing
and
him
so
racked
with
rheumatiz
so
they
turned
aside
to
shake
hands
with
the
old
man
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
occasion
and
had
his
premeditated
speech
well
master
marner
he
said
in
a
voice
that
quavered
a
good
deal
i
lived
to
see
my
words
come
true
i
was
the
first
to
say
there
was
no
harm
in
you
though
your
looks
might
be
again
you
and
i
was
the
first
to
say
you
get
your
money
back
and
it
nothing
but
rightful
as
you
should
and
i
ha
said
the
amens
and
willing
at
the
holy
matrimony
but
tookey
done
it
a
good
while
now
and
i
hope
you
have
none
the
worse
luck
in
the
open
yard
before
the
rainbow
the
party
of
guests
were
already
assembled
though
it
was
still
nearly
an
hour
before
the
appointed
feast
time
but
by
this
means
they
could
not
only
enjoy
the
slow
advent
of
their
pleasure
they
had
also
ample
leisure
to
talk
of
silas
marner
strange
history
and
arrive
by
due
degrees
at
the
conclusion
that
he
had
brought
a
blessing
on
himself
by
acting
like
a
father
to
a
lone
motherless
child
even
the
farrier
did
not
negative
this
sentiment
on
the
contrary
he
took
it
up
as
peculiarly
his
own
and
invited
any
hardy
person
present
to
contradict
him
but
he
met
with
no
contradiction
and
all
differences
among
the
company
were
merged
in
a
general
agreement
with
snell
sentiment
that
when
a
man
had
deserved
his
good
luck
it
was
the
part
of
his
neighbours
to
wish
him
joy
as
the
bridal
group
approached
a
hearty
cheer
was
raised
in
the
rainbow
yard
and
ben
winthrop
whose
jokes
had
retained
their
acceptable
flavour
found
it
agreeable
to
turn
in
there
and
receive
congratulations
not
requiring
the
proposed
interval
of
quiet
at
the
before
joining
the
company
eppie
had
a
larger
garden
than
she
had
ever
expected
there
now
and
in
other
ways
there
had
been
alterations
at
the
expense
of
cass
the
landlord
to
suit
silas
larger
family
for
he
and
eppie
had
declared
that
they
would
rather
stay
at
the
than
go
to
any
new
home
the
garden
was
fenced
with
stones
on
two
sides
but
in
front
there
was
an
open
fence
through
which
the
flowers
shone
with
answering
gladness
as
the
four
united
people
came
within
sight
of
them
o
father
said
eppie
what
a
pretty
home
ours
is
i
think
nobody
could
be
happier
than
we
are
