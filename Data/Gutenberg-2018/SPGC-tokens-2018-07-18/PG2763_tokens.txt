the
world
s
desire
by
rider
haggard
and
andrew
lang
to
richmond
preface
the
period
in
which
the
story
of
world
s
is
cast
was
a
period
when
as
miss
braddon
remarks
of
the
age
of
the
plantagenets
anything
might
recent
discoveries
mainly
by
schliemann
and
flinders
petrie
have
shown
that
there
really
was
much
intercourse
between
heroic
greece
the
greece
of
the
achaeans
and
the
egypt
of
the
ramessids
this
connection
rumoured
of
in
greek
legends
is
attested
by
egyptian
relics
found
in
the
graves
of
mycenae
and
by
very
ancient
levantine
pottery
found
in
contemporary
sites
in
egypt
homer
himself
shows
us
odysseus
telling
a
feigned
but
obviously
not
improbable
tale
of
an
achaean
raid
on
egypt
meanwhile
the
sojourn
of
the
israelites
with
their
exodus
from
the
land
of
bondage
though
not
yet
found
to
be
recorded
on
the
egyptian
monuments
was
probably
part
of
the
great
contemporary
stir
among
the
peoples
these
events
which
are
only
known
through
hebrew
texts
must
have
worn
a
very
different
aspect
in
the
eyes
of
egyptians
and
of
achaean
observers
hostile
in
faith
to
the
children
of
israel
the
topic
has
since
been
treated
in
fiction
by
ebers
in
his
in
such
a
twilight
age
fancy
has
free
play
but
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
in
this
romance
modern
fancy
has
accidentally
coincided
with
that
of
ancient
greece
most
of
the
novel
was
written
and
the
apparently
marvels
attributed
to
helen
had
been
put
on
paper
when
a
part
of
furtwängler
s
recent
great
lexicon
of
mythology
appeared
with
the
article
on
helen
the
authors
of
world
s
read
it
with
a
feeling
akin
to
amazement
their
wildest
inventions
about
the
daughter
of
the
swan
it
seemed
had
parallels
in
the
obscurer
legends
of
hellas
there
actually
is
a
tradition
preserved
by
eustathius
that
paris
beguiled
helen
by
magically
putting
on
the
aspect
of
menelaus
there
is
a
mediaeval
parallel
in
the
story
of
uther
and
ygerne
mother
of
arthur
and
the
classical
case
of
zeus
and
amphitryon
is
familiar
again
the
ruby
of
helen
in
the
tale
is
mentioned
by
servius
in
his
commentary
on
virgil
it
was
pointed
out
to
one
of
the
authors
by
mackail
but
we
did
not
know
that
the
star
of
the
story
was
actually
called
the
in
ancient
greek
fable
the
many
voices
of
helen
are
alluded
to
by
homer
in
the
she
was
also
named
in
old
tradition
to
add
that
she
could
assume
the
aspect
of
every
man
s
first
love
was
easy
goethe
introduces
the
same
quality
in
the
fair
witch
of
his
a
respectable
portrait
of
meriamun
s
secret
counsellor
exists
in
pottery
in
the
british
museum
though
as
it
chances
it
was
not
discovered
by
us
until
after
the
publication
of
this
romance
the
laestrygonian
of
the
last
battle
is
introduced
as
a
norseman
gladstone
we
think
was
perhaps
the
first
to
point
out
that
the
laestrygonians
of
the
with
their
home
on
a
fiord
in
the
land
of
the
midnight
sun
were
probably
derived
from
travellers
tales
of
the
north
borne
with
the
amber
along
the
immemorial
sacred
way
the
magic
of
meriamun
is
in
accordance
with
egyptian
ideas
her
resuscitation
of
the
dead
woman
hataska
has
a
singular
parallel
in
reginald
scot
s
of
where
the
spell
by
the
silence
of
the
night
is
not
without
poetry
the
general
conception
of
helen
as
the
world
s
desire
ideal
beauty
has
been
dealt
with
by
paul
de
victor
and
j
symonds
for
the
rest
some
details
of
battle
and
of
wounds
which
must
seem
very
to
critics
ignorant
of
greek
literature
are
borrowed
from
homer
the
world

desire
by
rider
haggard
and
andrew
lang

are
set
on

whereof
ye

the

along
the
banks
of
holy
nile
shall
echo
in
your
ears
the
while
the
fables
of
the
north

shall
mingle

the
fancies
of

book
i
i
the
silent
isle
across
the
wide
backs
of
the
waves
beneath
the
mountains
and
between
the
islands
a
ship
came
stealing
from
the
dark
into
the
dusk
and
from
the
dusk
into
the
dawn
the
ship
had
but
one
mast
one
broad
brown
sail
with
a
star
embroidered
on
it
in
gold
her
stem
and
stern
were
built
high
and
curved
like
a
bird
s
beak
her
prow
was
painted
scarlet
and
she
was
driven
by
oars
as
well
as
by
the
western
wind
a
man
stood
alone
on
the
at
the
bows
a
man
who
looked
always
forward
through
the
night
and
the
twilight
and
the
clear
morning
he
was
of
no
great
stature
but
and
very
with
many
signs
of
strength
he
had
blue
eyes
and
dark
curled
locks
falling
beneath
a
red
cap
such
as
sailors
wear
and
over
a
purple
cloak
fastened
with
a
brooch
of
gold
there
were
threads
of
silver
in
his
curls
and
his
beard
was
flecked
with
white
his
whole
heart
was
following
his
eyes
watching
first
for
the
blaze
of
the
island
beacons
out
of
the
darkness
and
later
for
the
smoke
rising
from
the
hills
but
he
watched
in
vain
there
was
neither
light
nor
smoke
on
the
grey
peak
that
lay
clear
against
a
field
of
yellow
sky
there
was
no
smoke
no
fire
no
sound
of
voices
nor
cry
of
birds
the
isle
was
deadly
still
as
they
neared
the
coast
and
neither
heard
nor
saw
a
sign
of
life
the
man
s
face
fell
the
gladness
went
out
of
his
eyes
his
features
grew
older
with
anxiety
and
doubt
and
with
longing
for
tidings
of
his
home
no
man
ever
loved
his
home
more
than
he
for
this
was
odysseus
the
son
of
laertes
whom
some
call
ulysses
returned
from
his
unsung
second
wandering
the
whole
world
has
heard
the
tale
of
his
first
voyage
how
he
was
tossed
for
ten
years
on
the
sea
after
the
taking
of
troy
how
he
reached
home
at
last
alone
and
disguised
as
a
beggar
how
he
found
violence
in
his
house
how
he
slew
his
foes
in
his
own
hall
and
won
his
wife
again
but
even
in
his
own
country
he
was
not
permitted
to
rest
for
there
was
a
curse
upon
him
and
a
labour
to
be
accomplished
he
must
wander
again
till
he
reached
the
land
of
men
who
had
never
tasted
salt
nor
ever
heard
of
the
salt
sea
there
he
must
sacrifice
to
the
and
then
at
last
set
his
face
homewards
now
he
had
endured
that
curse
he
had
fulfilled
the
prophecy
he
had
angered
by
misadventure
the
goddess
who
was
his
friend
and
after
adventures
that
have
never
yet
been
told
he
had
arrived
within
a
bowshot
of
ithaca
he
came
from
strange
countries
from
the
gates
of
the
sun
and
from
white
rock
from
the
passing
place
of
souls
and
the
people
of
dreams
but
he
found
his
own
isle
more
still
and
strange
by
far
the
realm
of
dreams
was
not
so
dumb
the
gates
of
the
sun
were
not
so
still
as
the
shores
of
the
familiar
island
beneath
the
rising
dawn
this
story
whereof
the
substance
was
set
out
long
ago
by
rei
the
instructed
egyptian
priest
tells
what
he
found
there
and
the
tale
of
the
last
adventures
of
odysseus
laertes
son
the
ship
ran
on
and
won
the
haven
sheltered
from
wind
by
two
headlands
of
sheer
cliff
there
she
sailed
straight
in
till
the
leaves
of
the
broad
olive
tree
at
the
head
of
the
inlet
were
tangled
in
her
cordage
then
the
wanderer
without
once
looking
back
or
saying
one
word
of
farewell
to
his
crew
caught
a
bough
of
the
olive
tree
with
his
hand
and
swung
himself
ashore
here
he
kneeled
and
kissed
the
earth
and
covering
his
head
within
his
cloak
he
prayed
that
he
might
find
his
house
at
peace
his
wife
dear
and
true
and
his
son
worthy
of
him
but
not
one
word
of
his
prayer
was
to
be
granted
the
gods
give
and
take
but
on
the
earth
the
gods
can
not
restore
when
he
rose
from
his
knees
he
glanced
back
across
the
waters
but
there
was
now
no
ship
in
the
haven
nor
any
sign
of
a
sail
upon
the
seas
and
still
the
land
was
silent
not
even
the
wild
birds
cried
a
welcome
the
sun
was
hardly
up
men
were
scarce
awake
the
wanderer
said
to
himself
and
he
set
a
stout
heart
to
the
steep
path
leading
up
the
hill
over
the
wolds
and
across
the
ridge
of
rock
that
divides
the
two
masses
of
the
island
up
he
climbed
purposing
as
of
old
to
seek
the
house
of
his
faithful
servant
the
swineherd
and
learn
from
him
the
tidings
of
his
home
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
he
stopped
to
rest
and
looked
down
on
the
house
of
the
servant
but
the
strong
oak
palisade
was
broken
no
smoke
came
from
the
hole
in
the
thatched
roof
and
as
he
approached
the
dogs
did
not
run
barking
as
do
at
the
stranger
the
very
path
to
the
house
was
overgrown
and
dumb
with
grass
even
a
dog
s
keen
ears
could
scarcely
have
heard
a
footstep
the
door
of
the
swineherd
s
hut
was
open
but
all
was
dark
within
the
spiders
had
woven
a
glittering
web
across
the
empty
blackness
a
sign
that
for
many
days
no
man
had
entered
then
the
wanderer
shouted
twice
and
thrice
but
the
only
answer
was
an
echo
from
the
hill
he
went
in
hoping
to
find
food
or
perhaps
a
spark
of
fire
sheltered
under
the
dry
leaves
but
all
was
vacant
and
cold
as
death
the
wanderer
came
forth
into
the
warm
sunlight
set
his
face
to
the
hill
again
and
went
on
his
way
to
the
city
of
ithaca
he
saw
the
sea
from
the
glittering
as
of
yore
but
there
were
no
brown
sails
of
on
the
sea
all
the
land
that
should
now
have
waved
with
the
white
corn
was
green
with
tangled
weeds
down
the
rugged
path
was
a
grove
of
alders
and
the
basin
into
which
water
flowed
from
the
old
fountain
of
the
nymphs
but
no
maidens
were
there
with
their
pitchers
the
basin
was
broken
and
green
with
mould
the
water
slipped
through
the
crevices
and
hurried
to
the
sea
there
were
no
offerings
of
wayfarers
rags
and
pebbles
by
the
well
and
on
the
altar
of
the
nymphs
the
flame
had
long
been
cold
the
very
ashes
were
covered
with
grass
and
a
branch
of
ivy
had
hidden
the
stone
of
sacrifice
on
the
wanderer
pressed
with
a
heavy
heart
now
the
high
roof
of
his
own
hall
and
the
wide
fenced
courts
were
within
his
sight
and
he
hurried
forward
to
know
the
worst
too
soon
he
saw
that
the
roofs
were
smokeless
and
all
the
court
was
deep
in
weeds
where
the
altar
of
zeus
had
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
court
there
was
now
no
altar
but
a
great
grey
mound
not
of
earth
but
of
white
dust
mixed
with
black
over
this
mound
the
coarse
grass
pricked
up
scantily
like
thin
hair
on
a
leprosy
then
the
wanderer
shuddered
for
out
of
the
grey
mound
peeped
the
charred
black
bones
of
the
dead
he
drew
near
and
lo
the
whole
heap
was
of
nothing
else
than
the
ashes
of
men
and
women
death
had
been
busy
here
here
many
people
had
perished
of
a
pestilence
they
had
all
been
consumed
on
one
funeral
fire
while
they
who
laid
them
there
must
have
fled
for
there
was
no
sign
of
living
man
the
doors
gaped
open
and
none
entered
and
none
came
forth
the
house
was
dead
like
the
people
who
had
dwelt
in
it
then
the
wanderer
paused
where
once
the
old
hound
argos
had
welcomed
him
and
had
died
in
that
welcome
there
unwelcomed
he
stood
leaning
on
his
staff
then
a
sudden
ray
of
the
sun
fell
on
something
that
glittered
in
the
heap
and
he
touched
it
with
the
end
of
the
staff
that
he
had
in
his
hand
it
slid
jingling
from
the
heap
it
was
the
bone
of
a
forearm
and
that
which
glittered
on
it
was
a
ring
of
gold
on
the
gold
lambda
these
characters
were
engraved
ikmalios
mepoiesen
icmalios
made
me
at
the
sight
of
the
armlet
the
wanderer
fell
on
the
earth
grovelling
among
the
ashes
of
the
pyre
for
he
knew
the
gold
ring
which
he
had
brought
from
ephyre
long
ago
for
a
gift
to
his
wife
penelope
this
was
the
bracelet
of
the
bride
of
his
youth
and
here
a
mockery
and
a
terror
were
those
kind
arms
in
which
he
had
lain
then
his
strength
was
shaken
with
sobbing
and
his
hands
clutched
blindly
before
him
and
he
gathered
dust
and
cast
it
upon
his
head
till
the
dark
locks
were
defiled
with
the
ashes
of
his
dearest
and
he
longed
to
die
there
he
lay
biting
his
hands
for
sorrow
and
for
wrath
against
god
and
fate
there
he
lay
while
the
sun
in
the
heavens
smote
him
and
he
knew
it
not
while
the
wind
of
the
sunset
stirred
in
his
hair
and
he
stirred
not
he
could
not
even
shed
one
tear
for
this
was
the
sorest
of
all
the
sorrows
that
he
had
known
on
the
waves
of
the
sea
or
on
land
among
the
wars
of
men
the
sun
fell
and
the
ways
were
darkened
slowly
the
eastern
sky
grew
silver
with
the
moon
a
s
voice
was
heard
from
afar
it
drew
nearer
then
through
the
shadow
of
the
pyre
the
black
wings
fluttered
into
the
light
and
the
carrion
bird
fixed
its
talons
and
its
beak
on
the
wanderer
s
neck
then
he
moved
at
length
tossed
up
an
arm
and
caught
the
bird
of
darkness
by
the
neck
and
broke
it
and
dashed
it
on
the
ground
his
sick
heart
was
mad
with
the
little
sudden
pain
and
he
clutched
for
the
knife
in
his
girdle
that
he
might
slay
himself
but
he
was
unarmed
at
last
he
rose
muttering
and
stood
in
the
moonlight
like
a
lion
in
some
ruinous
palace
of
forgotten
kings
he
was
faint
with
hunger
and
weak
with
long
lamenting
as
he
stepped
within
his
own
doors
there
he
paused
on
that
high
threshold
of
stone
where
once
he
had
sat
in
the
disguise
of
a
beggar
that
very
threshold
whence
on
another
day
he
had
shot
the
shafts
of
doom
among
the
wooers
of
his
wife
and
the
wasters
of
his
home
but
now
his
wife
was
dead
all
his
voyaging
was
ended
here
and
all
his
wars
were
vain
in
the
white
light
the
house
of
his
kingship
was
no
more
than
the
ghost
of
a
home
dreadful
unfamiliar
empty
of
warmth
and
love
and
light
the
tables
were
fallen
here
and
there
throughout
the
long
hall
mouldering
bones
from
the
funeral
feast
and
shattered
cups
and
dishes
lay
in
one
confusion
the
ivory
chairs
were
broken
and
on
the
walls
the
moonbeams
glistened
now
and
again
from
points
of
steel
and
blades
of
bronze
though
many
swords
were
dark
with
rust
but
there
in
its
gleaming
case
lay
one
thing
friendly
and
familiar
there
lay
the
bow
of
eurytus
the
bow
for
which
great
heracles
had
slain
his
own
host
in
his
halls
the
dreadful
bow
that
no
mortal
man
but
the
wanderer
could
bend
he
was
never
used
to
carry
this
precious
bow
with
him
on
shipboard
when
he
went
to
the
wars
but
treasured
it
at
home
the
memorial
of
a
dear
friend
foully
slain
so
now
when
the
voices
of
dog
and
slave
and
child
and
wife
were
mute
there
yet
came
out
of
the
stillness
a
word
of
welcome
to
the
wanderer
for
this
bow
which
had
thrilled
in
the
grip
of
a
god
and
had
scattered
the
shafts
of
the
vengeance
of
heracles
was
wondrously
made
and
magical
a
spirit
dwelt
within
it
which
knew
of
things
to
come
which
boded
the
battle
from
afar
and
therefore
always
before
the
slaying
of
men
the
bow
sang
strangely
through
the
night
the
voice
of
it
was
thin
and
shrill
a
ringing
and
a
singing
of
the
string
and
of
the
bow
while
the
wanderer
stood
and
looked
on
his
weapon
hark
the
bow
began
to
thrill
the
sound
was
faint
at
first
a
thin
note
but
as
he
listened
the
voice
of
it
in
that
silence
grew
clear
strong
angry
and
triumphant
in
his
ears
and
to
his
heart
it
seemed
that
the
wordless
chant
rang
thus
keen
and
low
doth
the
arrow
sing
the
song
of
the
bow
the
sound
of
the
string
the
shafts
cry
shrill
let
us
forth
again
let
us
feed
our
fill
on
the
flesh
of
men
greedy
and
fleet
do
we
fly
from
far
like
the
birds
that
meet
for
the
feast
of
war
till
the
air
of
fight
with
our
wings
be
stirred
as
it
whirrs
from
the
flight
of
the
ravening
bird
like
the
flakes
that
drift
on
the
s
breath
many
and
swift
and
winged
for
death
greedy
and
fleet
do
we
speed
from
far
like
the
birds
that
meet
on
the
bridge
of
war
fleet
as
ghosts
that
wail
when
the
dart
strikes
true
do
the
swift
shafts
hail
till
they
drink
warm
dew
keen
and
low
do
the
grey
shafts
sing
the
song
of
the
bow
the
sound
of
the
string
this
was
the
message
of
death
and
this
was
the
first
sound
that
had
broken
the
stillness
of
his
home
at
the
welcome
of
this
music
which
spoke
to
his
heart
this
music
he
had
heard
so
many
a
time
the
wanderer
knew
that
there
was
war
at
hand
he
knew
that
the
wings
of
his
arrows
should
be
swift
to
fly
and
their
beaks
of
bronze
were
whetted
to
drink
the
blood
of
men
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
the
bow
and
tried
the
string
and
it
answered
shrill
as
the
song
of
the
swallow
then
at
length
when
he
heard
the
bowstring
twang
to
his
touch
the
fountains
of
his
sorrow
were
unsealed
tears
came
like
soft
rains
on
a
frozen
land
and
the
wanderer
wept
when
he
had
his
fill
of
weeping
he
rose
for
hunger
drove
him
hunger
that
is
of
all
things
the
most
shameless
being
stronger
far
than
sorrow
or
love
or
any
other
desire
the
wanderer
found
his
way
through
the
narrow
door
behind
the
dais
and
stumbling
now
and
again
over
fallen
fragments
of
the
home
which
he
himself
had
built
he
went
to
the
inner
secret
storehouse
even
could
scarcely
find
the
door
for
saplings
of
trees
had
grown
up
about
it
yet
he
found
it
at
last
within
the
holy
well
the
water
was
yet
babbling
and
shining
in
the
moonlight
over
the
silver
sands
and
here
too
there
was
store
of
mouldering
grain
for
the
house
had
been
abundantly
rich
when
the
great
plague
fell
upon
the
people
while
he
was
far
away
so
he
found
food
to
satisfy
his
hunger
after
a
sort
and
next
he
gathered
together
out
of
his
the
beautiful
golden
armour
of
unhappy
paris
son
of
priam
the
false
love
of
fair
helen
these
arms
had
been
taken
at
the
sack
of
troy
and
had
lain
long
in
the
treasury
of
menelaus
in
sparta
but
on
a
day
he
had
given
them
to
odysseus
the
dearest
of
all
his
guests
the
wanderer
clad
himself
in
this
golden
gear
and
took
the
sword
called
euryalus
s
gift
a
bronze
blade
with
a
silver
hilt
and
a
sheath
of
ivory
which
a
stranger
had
given
him
in
a
land
already
the
love
of
life
had
come
back
to
him
now
that
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
had
heard
the
song
of
the
bow
the
slayer
of
men
he
lived
yet
and
hope
lived
in
him
though
his
house
was
desolate
and
his
wedded
wife
was
dead
and
there
was
none
to
give
him
tidings
of
his
one
child
telemachus
even
so
life
beat
strong
in
his
heart
and
his
hands
would
keep
his
head
if
any
had
come
to
the
city
of
ithaca
and
made
their
home
there
like
hawks
in
the
forsaken
nest
of
an
eagle
of
the
sea
so
he
clad
himself
in
his
armour
and
chose
out
two
spears
from
a
stand
of
lances
and
cleaned
them
and
girt
about
his
shoulders
a
quiver
full
of
shafts
and
took
in
hand
his
great
bow
the
bow
of
eurytus
which
no
other
man
could
bend
then
he
went
forth
from
the
ruined
house
into
the
moonlight
went
forth
for
the
last
time
for
never
again
did
the
high
roof
echo
to
the
footstep
of
its
lord
long
has
the
grass
grown
over
it
and
the
wailed
ii
the
vision
of
the
world
s
desire
the
fragrant
night
was
clear
and
still
the
silence
scarce
broken
by
the
lapping
of
the
waves
as
the
wanderer
went
down
from
his
fallen
home
to
the
city
on
the
sea
walking
warily
and
watching
for
any
light
from
the
houses
of
the
people
but
they
were
all
as
dark
as
his
own
many
of
them
roofless
and
ruined
for
after
the
plague
an
earthquake
had
smitten
the
city
there
were
gaping
chasms
in
the
road
here
and
there
and
through
rifts
in
the
walls
of
the
houses
the
moon
shone
strangely
making
ragged
shadows
at
last
the
wanderer
reached
the
temple
of
athene
the
goddess
of
war
but
the
roof
had
fallen
in
the
pillars
were
overset
and
the
scent
of
wild
thyme
growing
in
the
broken
pavement
rose
where
he
walked
yet
as
he
stood
by
the
door
of
the
fane
where
he
had
burned
so
many
a
sacrifice
at
length
he
spied
a
light
blazing
from
the
windows
of
a
great
chapel
by
the
sea
it
was
the
temple
of
aphrodite
the
queen
of
love
and
from
the
open
door
a
sweet
savour
of
incense
and
a
golden
blaze
rushed
forth
till
they
were
lost
in
the
silver
of
the
moonshine
and
in
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea
thither
the
wanderer
went
slowly
for
his
limbs
were
swaying
with
weariness
and
he
was
half
in
a
dream
yet
he
hid
himself
cunningly
in
the
shadow
of
a
long
avenue
of
myrtles
for
he
guessed
that
were
keeping
revel
in
the
forsaken
shrine
but
he
heard
no
sound
of
singing
and
no
tread
of
dancing
feet
within
the
fane
of
the
goddess
of
love
the
sacred
plot
of
the
goddess
and
her
chapels
were
silent
he
hearkened
awhile
and
watched
till
at
last
he
took
courage
drew
near
the
doors
and
entered
the
holy
place
but
in
the
tall
bronze
braziers
there
were
no
faggots
burning
nor
were
there
torches
lighted
in
the
hands
of
the
golden
men
and
maids
the
images
that
stand
within
the
fane
of
aphrodite
yet
if
he
did
not
dream
nor
take
moonlight
for
fire
the
temple
was
bathed
in
showers
of
gold
by
a
splendour
of
flame
none
might
see
its
centre
nor
its
fountain
it
sprang
neither
from
the
altar
nor
the
statue
of
the
goddess
but
was
everywhere
imminent
a
glory
not
of
this
world
a
fire
untended
and
unlit
and
the
painted
walls
with
the
stories
of
the
loves
of
men
and
gods
and
the
carven
pillars
and
the
beams
and
the
roof
of
green
were
bright
with
flaming
fire
at
this
the
wanderer
was
afraid
knowing
that
an
immortal
was
at
hand
for
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
gods
were
attended
as
he
had
seen
by
this
wonderful
light
of
unearthly
fire
so
he
bowed
his
head
and
hid
his
face
as
he
sat
by
the
altar
in
the
holiest
of
the
holy
shrine
and
with
his
right
hand
he
grasped
the
horns
of
the
altar
as
he
sat
there
perchance
he
woke
and
perchance
he
slept
however
it
was
it
seemed
to
him
that
soon
there
came
a
murmuring
and
a
whispering
of
the
myrtle
leaves
and
laurels
and
a
sound
in
the
tops
of
the
pines
and
then
his
face
was
fanned
by
a
breath
more
cold
than
the
wind
that
wakes
the
dawn
at
the
touch
of
this
breath
the
wanderer
shuddered
and
the
hair
on
his
flesh
stood
up
so
cold
was
the
strange
wind
there
was
silence
and
he
heard
a
voice
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
voice
of
no
mortal
but
of
a
goddess
for
the
speech
of
goddesses
was
not
strange
in
his
ears
he
knew
the
clarion
cry
of
athene
the
queen
of
wisdom
and
of
war
and
the
winning
words
of
circe
the
daughter
of
the
sun
and
the
sweet
song
of
calypso
s
voice
as
she
wove
with
her
golden
shuttle
at
the
loom
but
now
the
words
came
sweeter
than
the
moaning
of
doves
more
soft
than
sleep
so
came
the
golden
voice
whether
he
woke
or
whether
he
dreamed
odysseus
thou
knowest
me
not
nor
am
i
thy
lady
nor
hast
thou
ever
been
my
servant
where
is
she
the
queen
of
the
air
athene
and
why
comest
here
as
a
suppliant
at
the
knees
of
the
daughter
of
dione
he
answered
nothing
but
he
bowed
his
head
in
deeper
sorrow
the
voice
spake
again
behold
thy
house
is
desolate
thy
hearth
is
cold
the
wild
hare
breeds
on
thy
hearthstone
and
the
roosts
beneath
thy
thou
hast
neither
child
nor
wife
nor
native
land
and
hath
forsaken
thee
thy
lady
athene
many
a
time
didst
thou
sacrifice
to
her
the
thighs
of
kine
and
sheep
but
didst
thou
ever
give
so
much
as
a
pair
of
dove
to
hath
she
left
thee
as
the
dawn
forsook
tithonus
because
there
are
now
threads
of
silver
in
the
darkness
of
thy
hair
is
the
wise
goddess
fickle
as
a
nymph
of
the
woodland
or
the
wells
doth
she
love
a
man
only
for
the
bloom
of
his
youth
nay
i
know
not
but
this
i
know
that
on
thee
odysseus
old
age
will
soon
be
hastening
old
age
that
is
pitiless
and
ruinous
and
weary
and
weak
age
that
cometh
on
all
men
and
that
is
hateful
to
the
gods
therefore
odysseus
ere
yet
it
be
too
late
i
would
bow
even
thee
to
my
will
and
hold
thee
for
my
thrall
for
i
am
she
who
conquers
all
things
living
gods
and
beasts
and
men
and
hast
thou
thought
that
thou
only
shalt
escape
aphrodite
thou
that
hast
never
loved
as
i
would
have
men
love
thou
that
hast
never
obeyed
me
for
an
hour
nor
ever
known
the
joy
and
the
sorrow
that
are
mine
to
give
for
thou
didst
but
ensure
the
caresses
of
circe
the
daughter
of
the
sun
and
thou
wert
aweary
in
the
arms
of
calypso
and
the
sea
king
s
daughter
came
never
to
her
longing
as
for
her
who
is
dead
thy
dear
wife
penelope
thou
didst
love
her
with
a
loyal
heart
but
never
with
a
heart
of
fire
nay
she
was
but
thy
companion
thy
housewife
and
the
mother
of
thy
child
she
was
mingled
with
all
the
memories
of
the
land
thou
lovest
and
so
thou
gavest
her
a
little
love
but
she
is
dead
and
thy
child
too
is
no
more
and
thy
very
country
is
as
the
ashes
of
a
forsaken
hearth
where
once
was
a
camp
of
men
what
have
all
thy
wars
and
wanderings
won
for
thee
all
thy
labours
and
all
the
adventures
thou
hast
achieved
for
what
didst
thou
seek
among
the
living
and
the
dead
thou
soughtest
that
which
all
men
seek
thou
soughtest
world
s
they
find
it
not
nor
hast
thou
found
it
odysseus
and
thy
friends
are
dead
thy
land
is
dead
nothing
lives
but
hope
but
the
life
that
lies
before
thee
is
new
without
a
remnant
of
the
old
days
except
for
the
bitterness
of
longing
and
remembrance
out
of
this
new
life
and
the
unborn
hours
wilt
thou
not
give
what
never
before
thou
gavest
one
hour
to
me
to
be
my
servant
the
voice
as
it
seemed
grew
softer
and
came
nearer
till
the
wanderer
heard
it
whisper
in
his
very
ear
and
with
the
voice
came
a
divine
fragrance
the
breath
of
her
who
spoke
seemed
to
touch
his
neck
the
immortal
tresses
of
the
goddess
were
mingled
with
the
dark
curls
of
his
hair
the
voice
spake
again
nay
odysseus
didst
thou
not
once
give
me
one
little
hour
fear
not
for
thou
shalt
not
see
me
at
this
time
but
lift
thy
head
and
look
on
the
world
s
desire
then
the
wanderer
lifted
his
head
and
he
saw
as
it
were
in
a
picture
or
in
a
mirror
of
bronze
the
vision
of
a
girl
she
was
more
than
mortal
tall
and
though
still
in
the
first
flower
of
youth
and
almost
a
child
in
years
she
seemed
fair
as
a
goddess
and
so
beautiful
that
aphrodite
herself
may
perchance
have
envied
this
loveliness
she
was
slim
and
gracious
as
a
young
shoot
of
a
palm
tree
and
her
eyes
were
fearless
and
innocent
as
a
child
s
on
her
head
she
bore
a
shining
urn
of
bronze
as
if
she
were
bringing
water
from
the
wells
and
behind
her
was
the
foliage
of
a
plane
tree
then
the
wanderer
knew
her
and
saw
her
once
again
as
he
had
seen
her
when
in
his
boyhood
he
had
journeyed
to
the
court
of
her
father
king
tyndareus
for
as
he
entered
sparta
and
came
down
the
hill
taygetus
and
as
his
chariot
wheels
flashed
through
the
ford
of
eurotas
he
had
met
her
there
on
her
way
from
the
river
there
in
his
youth
his
eyes
had
gazed
on
the
loveliness
of
helen
and
his
heart
had
been
filled
with
the
desire
of
the
fairest
of
women
and
like
all
the
princes
of
achaia
he
had
sought
her
hand
in
marriage
but
helen
was
given
to
another
man
to
menelaus
atreus
s
son
of
an
evil
house
that
the
knees
of
many
might
be
loosened
in
death
and
that
there
might
be
a
song
in
the
ears
of
men
in
after
time
as
he
beheld
the
vision
of
young
helen
the
wanderer
too
grew
young
again
but
as
he
gazed
with
the
eyes
and
loved
with
the
first
love
of
a
boy
she
melted
like
a
mist
and
out
of
the
mist
came
another
vision
he
saw
himself
disguised
as
a
beggar
beaten
and
bruised
yet
seated
in
a
long
hall
bright
with
gold
while
a
woman
bathed
his
feet
and
anointed
his
head
with
oil
and
the
face
of
the
woman
was
the
face
of
the
maiden
and
even
more
beautiful
but
sad
with
grief
and
with
an
ancient
shame
then
he
remembered
how
once
he
had
stolen
into
troy
town
from
the
camp
of
the
achæans
and
how
he
had
crept
in
a
beggar
s
rags
within
the
house
of
priam
to
spy
upon
the
trojans
and
how
helen
the
fairest
of
women
had
bathed
him
and
anointed
him
with
oil
and
suffered
him
to
go
in
peace
all
for
the
memory
of
the
love
that
was
between
them
of
old
as
he
gazed
that
picture
faded
and
melted
in
the
mist
and
again
he
bowed
his
head
and
kneeled
by
the
golden
altar
of
the
goddess
crying
where
beneath
the
sunlight
dwells
the
golden
helen
for
now
he
had
only
one
desire
to
look
on
helen
again
before
he
died
then
the
voice
of
the
goddess
seemed
to
whisper
in
his
ear
did
i
not
say
truth
odysseus
wast
not
thou
my
servant
for
one
hour
and
did
not
love
save
thee
in
the
city
of
the
trojans
on
that
night
when
even
wisdom
was
of
no
avail
he
answered
yea
o
queen
behold
then
said
the
voice
i
would
again
have
mercy
and
be
kind
to
thee
for
if
i
aid
thee
not
thou
hast
no
more
life
left
among
men
home
and
kindred
and
native
land
thou
hast
none
and
but
for
me
thou
must
devour
thine
own
heart
and
be
lonely
till
thou
diest
therefore
i
breathe
into
thy
heart
a
sweet
forgetfulness
of
every
sorrow
and
i
breathe
love
into
thee
for
her
who
was
thy
first
love
in
the
beginning
of
thy
days
for
helen
is
living
yet
upon
the
earth
and
i
will
send
thee
on
the
quest
of
helen
and
thou
shalt
again
take
joy
in
war
and
wandering
thou
shalt
find
her
in
a
strange
land
among
a
strange
people
in
a
strife
of
gods
and
men
and
the
wisest
and
bravest
of
man
shall
sleep
at
last
in
the
arms
of
the
fairest
of
women
but
learn
this
odysseus
thou
must
set
thy
heart
on
no
other
woman
but
only
on
helen
and
i
give
thee
a
sign
to
know
her
by
in
a
land
of
magic
and
among
women
that
deal
in
sorceries
the
breast
of
helen
a
jewel
shines
a
great
the
gift
i
gave
her
on
her
when
she
was
bride
to
menelaus
from
that
stone
fall
red
drops
like
blood
and
they
drip
on
her
vestment
and
there
vanish
and
do
not
stain
by
the
star
of
love
shalt
thou
know
her
by
the
star
shalt
thou
swear
to
her
and
if
thou
knowest
not
the
portent
of
the
bleeding
star
or
if
thou
breakest
that
oath
never
in
this
life
odysseus
shalt
thou
win
the
golden
helen
and
thine
own
death
shall
come
from
the
water
the
swiftest
death
that
the
saying
of
the
dead
prophet
may
be
fulfilled
yet
first
shalt
thou
lie
in
the
arms
of
the
golden
the
wanderer
answered
queen
how
may
this
be
for
i
am
alone
on
a
seagirt
isle
and
i
have
no
ship
and
no
companions
to
speed
me
over
the
great
gulf
of
the
sea
then
the
voice
answered
fear
not
the
gods
can
bring
to
pass
even
greater
things
than
these
go
from
my
house
and
lie
down
to
sleep
in
my
holy
ground
within
the
noise
of
the
wash
of
the
waves
there
sleep
and
take
thy
rest
thy
strength
shall
come
back
to
thee
and
before
the
setting
of
the
new
sun
thou
shalt
be
sailing
on
the
path
to
the
world
s
desire
but
first
drink
from
the
chalice
on
my
altar
fare
thee
well
the
voice
died
into
silence
like
the
dying
of
music
the
wanderer
awoke
and
lifted
his
head
but
the
light
had
faded
and
the
temple
was
grey
in
the
first
waking
of
the
dawn
yet
there
on
the
altar
where
no
cup
had
been
stood
a
deep
chalice
of
gold
full
of
red
wine
to
the
brim
this
the
wanderer
lifted
and
drained
a
draught
of
nepenthe
the
magic
cup
that
puts
trouble
out
of
mind
as
he
drank
a
wave
of
sweet
hope
went
over
his
heart
and
buried
far
below
it
the
sorrow
of
remembrance
and
the
trouble
of
the
past
and
the
longing
desire
for
loves
that
were
no
more
with
a
light
step
he
went
forth
like
a
younger
man
taking
the
two
spears
in
his
hand
and
the
bow
upon
his
back
and
he
lay
down
beneath
a
great
rock
that
looked
toward
the
deep
and
there
he
slept
iii
the
slaying
of
the
sidonians
morning
broke
in
the
east
a
new
day
dawned
upon
the
silent
sea
and
on
the
world
of
light
and
sound
the
sunrise
topped
the
hill
at
last
and
fell
upon
the
golden
raiment
of
the
wanderer
where
he
slept
making
it
blaze
like
living
fire
as
the
sun
touched
him
the
prow
of
a
black
ship
stole
swiftly
round
the
headland
for
the
oarsmen
drove
her
well
with
the
oars
any
man
who
saw
her
would
have
known
her
to
be
a
vessel
of
the
merchants
of
sidon
the
most
cunning
people
and
the
greediest
of
gain
for
on
her
prow
were
two
shapes
of
dwarfs
with
gaping
mouths
and
knotted
limbs
such
gods
as
those
were
worshipped
by
the
sidonians
she
was
now
returning
from
albion
an
isle
beyond
the
pillars
of
heracles
and
the
gates
of
the
great
sea
where
much
store
of
tin
is
found
and
she
had
rich
merchandise
on
board
on
the
beside
the
steersman
was
the
captain
a
thin
sailor
who
looked
shoreward
and
saw
the
sun
blaze
on
the
golden
armour
of
the
wanderer
they
were
so
far
off
that
he
could
not
see
clearly
what
it
was
that
glittered
yellow
but
all
that
glittered
yellow
was
a
lure
for
him
and
gold
drew
him
on
as
iron
draws
the
hands
of
heroes
so
he
bade
the
helmsman
steer
straight
in
for
the
sea
was
deep
below
the
rock
and
there
they
all
saw
a
man
lying
asleep
in
golden
armour
they
whispered
together
laughing
silently
and
then
sprang
ashore
taking
with
them
a
rope
of
twisted
a
hawser
of
the
ship
and
a
strong
cable
of
byblus
the
papyrus
plant
on
these
ropes
they
cast
a
loop
and
a
running
knot
a
lasso
for
throwing
so
that
they
might
capture
the
man
in
safety
from
a
distance
with
these
in
their
hands
they
crept
up
the
cliff
for
their
purpose
was
to
noose
the
man
in
golden
armour
and
drag
him
on
board
their
vessel
and
carry
him
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
of
egypt
and
there
sell
him
for
a
slave
to
the
king
for
the
sidonians
who
were
greedy
of
everything
loved
nothing
better
than
to
catch
free
men
and
women
who
might
be
purchased
by
mere
force
or
guile
and
then
be
sold
again
for
gold
and
silver
and
cattle
many
kings
sons
had
thus
been
captured
by
them
and
had
seen
the
day
of
slavery
in
babylon
or
tyre
or
egyptian
thebes
and
had
died
sadly
far
from
the
argive
land
so
the
sidonians
went
round
warily
and
creeping
in
silence
over
the
short
grass
and
thyme
towards
the
wanderer
were
soon
as
near
to
him
as
a
child
could
throw
a
stone
like
shepherds
who
seek
to
net
a
sleeping
lion
they
came
cunningly
yet
not
so
cunningly
but
that
the
wanderer
heard
them
through
his
dreams
and
turned
and
sat
up
looking
around
him
half
awake
but
as
he
woke
the
noose
fell
about
his
neck
and
over
his
arms
and
they
drew
it
hard
and
threw
him
on
his
back
before
they
could
touch
him
he
was
on
his
feet
again
crying
his
terribly
the
cry
that
shook
the
towers
of
ilium
and
he
rushed
upon
them
clutching
at
his
sword
hilt
the
men
who
were
nearest
him
and
had
hold
of
the
rope
let
it
fall
from
their
hands
and
fled
but
the
others
swung
behind
him
and
dragged
with
all
their
force
if
his
arms
had
been
free
so
that
he
might
draw
his
sword
it
would
have
gone
ill
with
them
many
as
they
were
for
the
sidonians
have
no
stomach
for
sword
blades
but
his
arms
were
held
in
the
noose
yet
they
did
not
easily
master
him
but
as
those
who
had
fled
came
back
and
they
all
laid
hands
on
the
rope
together
they
overpowered
him
by
main
force
at
last
and
hauled
him
step
by
step
till
he
stumbled
on
a
rock
and
fell
then
they
rushed
at
him
and
threw
themselves
all
upon
his
body
and
bound
him
with
ropes
in
cunning
sailor
knots
but
the
booty
was
dearly
won
and
they
did
not
all
return
alive
for
he
crushed
one
man
with
his
knees
till
the
breath
left
him
and
the
thigh
of
another
he
broke
with
a
blow
of
his
foot
but
at
last
his
strength
was
spent
and
they
had
him
like
a
bird
in
a
snare
so
by
might
and
main
they
bore
him
to
their
ship
and
threw
him
down
on
the
of
the
vessel
there
they
mocked
him
though
they
were
half
afraid
for
even
now
he
was
terrible
then
they
hauled
up
the
sail
again
and
sat
down
to
the
oars
the
wind
blew
fair
for
the
mouth
of
the
nile
and
the
of
egypt
the
wind
was
fair
and
their
hearts
were
light
for
they
had
been
among
the
first
of
their
people
to
deal
with
the
wild
tribes
of
the
island
albion
and
had
brought
tin
and
gold
for
african
sea
shells
and
rude
glass
beads
from
egypt
and
now
near
the
very
end
of
their
adventure
they
had
caught
a
man
whose
armour
and
whose
body
were
worth
a
king
s
ransom
it
was
a
lucky
voyage
they
said
and
the
wind
was
fair
the
rest
of
the
journey
was
long
but
in
waters
they
passed
by
cephalonia
and
the
rock
of
ægilips
and
wooded
zacynthus
and
samê
and
of
all
those
isles
he
was
the
lord
whom
they
were
now
selling
into
captivity
but
he
lay
still
breathing
heavily
and
he
stirred
but
once
that
was
when
they
neared
zacynthus
then
he
strained
his
head
round
with
a
mighty
strain
and
he
saw
the
sun
go
down
upon
the
heights
of
rocky
ithaca
for
that
last
time
of
all
so
the
swift
ship
ran
along
the
coast
slipping
by
forgotten
towns
past
the
echinean
isles
and
the
elian
shore
and
pleasant
eirene
they
sped
and
it
was
dusk
ere
they
reached
dorion
deep
night
had
fallen
when
they
ran
by
pylos
and
the
light
of
the
fires
in
the
hall
of
pisistratus
the
son
of
nestor
the
old
shone
out
across
the
sandy
and
the
sea
but
when
they
were
come
near
malea
the
southernmost
point
of
land
where
two
seas
meet
there
the
storm
snatched
them
and
drove
them
ever
southwards
beyond
crete
towards
the
mouth
of
the
nile
they
scudded
long
before
the
losing
their
reckoning
and
rushing
by
island
temples
that
showed
like
ghosts
through
the
mist
and
past
havens
which
they
could
not
win
on
they
fled
and
the
men
would
gladly
have
lightened
the
ship
by
casting
the
cargo
overboard
but
the
captain
watched
the
hatches
with
a
sword
and
two
spears
in
his
hand
he
would
sink
or
swim
with
the
ship
he
would
go
down
with
his
treasure
or
reach
sidon
the
city
of
flowers
and
build
a
white
house
among
the
palms
by
the
waters
of
bostren
and
never
try
the
sea
again
so
he
swore
and
he
would
not
let
them
cast
the
wanderer
overboard
as
they
desired
because
he
had
brought
bad
luck
he
shall
bring
a
good
price
in
tanis
cried
the
captain
and
at
last
the
storm
abated
and
the
sidonians
took
heart
and
were
glad
like
men
escaped
from
death
so
they
sacrificed
and
poured
forth
wine
before
the
on
the
prow
of
their
vessel
and
burned
incense
on
their
little
altar
in
their
mirth
and
to
mock
the
wanderer
they
hung
his
sword
and
his
shield
against
the
mast
and
his
quiver
and
his
bow
they
arrayed
in
the
fashion
of
a
trophy
and
they
mocked
him
believing
that
he
knew
no
word
of
their
speech
but
he
knew
it
well
as
he
knew
the
speech
of
the
people
of
egypt
for
he
had
seen
the
cities
of
many
men
and
had
spoken
with
captains
and
mercenaries
from
many
a
land
in
the
great
wars
the
sidonians
however
jibed
and
spoke
freely
before
him
saying
how
they
were
bound
for
the
rich
city
of
tanis
on
the
banks
of
the
river
of
egypt
and
how
the
captain
was
minded
to
pay
his
toll
to
pharaoh
with
the
body
and
the
armour
of
the
wanderer
that
he
might
seem
the
comelier
and
a
gift
more
fit
for
a
king
the
sailors
slackened
his
bonds
a
little
and
brought
him
dried
meat
and
wine
and
he
ate
till
his
strength
returned
to
him
then
he
entreated
them
by
signs
to
loosen
the
cord
that
bound
his
legs
for
indeed
his
limbs
were
dead
through
the
strength
of
the
bonds
and
his
armour
was
eating
into
his
flesh
at
his
prayer
they
took
some
pity
of
him
and
loosened
his
bonds
again
and
he
lay
upon
his
back
moving
his
legs
to
and
fro
till
his
strength
came
back
so
they
sailed
southward
ever
through
smooth
waters
and
past
the
islands
that
lie
like
in
the
midland
sea
many
a
strange
sight
they
saw
vessels
bearing
slaves
whose
sighing
might
be
heard
above
the
sighing
of
wind
and
water
young
men
and
maidens
of
ionia
and
achaia
stolen
by
into
bondage
now
they
would
touch
at
the
white
havens
of
a
peaceful
city
and
again
they
would
watch
a
smoke
on
the
all
day
rising
black
into
the
heavens
but
by
nightfall
the
smoke
would
change
to
a
great
roaring
fire
from
the
beacons
of
a
beleaguered
island
town
the
fire
would
blaze
on
the
masts
of
the
ships
of
the
besiegers
and
show
on
their
sails
and
glitter
on
the
gilded
shields
that
lined
the
bulwarks
of
their
ships
but
the
sidonians
sped
on
till
one
night
they
anchored
off
a
little
isle
that
lies
over
against
the
mouth
of
the
nile
beneath
this
isle
they
moored
the
ship
and
slept
most
of
them
ashore
then
the
wanderer
began
to
plot
a
way
to
escape
though
the
enterprise
seemed
desperate
enough
he
was
lying
in
the
darkness
of
the
hold
sleepless
and
sore
with
his
bonds
while
his
guard
watched
under
an
awning
in
the
moonlight
on
the
deck
they
dreamed
so
little
of
his
escaping
that
they
visited
him
only
by
watches
now
and
again
and
as
it
chanced
the
man
whose
turn
it
was
to
see
that
all
was
well
fell
asleep
many
a
thought
went
through
the
prisoner
s
mind
and
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
vision
of
the
goddess
was
only
a
vision
of
sleep
which
came
as
they
said
through
the
false
gates
of
ivory
and
not
through
the
gates
of
horn
so
he
was
to
live
in
slavery
after
all
a
king
no
longer
but
a
captive
toiling
in
the
egyptian
mines
of
sinai
or
a
soldier
at
a
palace
gate
till
he
died
thus
he
brooded
till
out
of
the
stillness
came
a
thin
faint
thrilling
sound
from
the
bow
that
hung
against
the
mast
over
his
head
the
bow
that
he
never
thought
to
string
again
there
was
a
noise
of
a
singing
of
the
bow
and
of
the
string
and
the
wordless
song
shaped
itself
thus
in
the
heart
of
the
wanderer
lo
the
hour
is
nigh
and
the
time
to
smite
when
the
foe
shall
fly
from
the
arrow
s
flight
let
the
bronze
bite
deep
let
the
fly
upon
them
that
sleep
and
are
ripe
to
die
shrill
and
low
do
the
grey
shafts
sing
the
song
of
the
bow
the
sound
of
the
string
then
the
low
music
died
into
the
silence
and
the
wanderer
knew
that
the
next
sun
would
not
set
on
the
day
of
slavery
and
that
his
revenge
was
near
his
bonds
would
be
no
barrier
to
his
vengeance
they
would
break
like
burnt
tow
he
knew
in
the
fire
of
his
anger
long
since
in
his
old
days
of
wandering
calypso
his
love
had
taught
him
in
the
summer
leisure
of
her
isle
how
to
tie
the
knots
that
no
man
could
untie
and
to
undo
all
the
knots
that
men
can
bind
he
remembered
this
lesson
in
the
night
when
the
bow
sang
of
war
so
he
thought
no
more
of
sleeping
but
cunningly
and
swiftly
unknotted
all
the
cords
and
the
bonds
which
bound
him
to
a
bar
of
iron
in
the
hold
he
might
have
escaped
now
perhaps
if
he
had
stolen
on
deck
without
waking
the
guards
dived
thence
and
swam
under
water
towards
the
island
where
he
might
have
hidden
himself
in
the
bush
but
he
desired
revenge
no
less
than
freedom
and
had
set
his
heart
on
coming
in
a
ship
of
his
own
and
with
all
the
great
treasure
of
the
sidonians
before
the
egyptian
king
with
this
in
his
mind
he
did
not
throw
off
the
cords
but
let
them
lie
on
his
arms
and
legs
and
about
his
body
as
if
they
were
still
tied
fast
but
he
fought
against
sleep
lest
in
moving
when
he
woke
he
might
reveal
the
trick
and
be
bound
again
so
he
lay
and
waited
and
in
the
morning
the
sailors
came
on
board
and
mocked
at
him
again
in
his
mirth
one
of
the
men
took
a
dish
of
meat
and
of
lentils
and
set
it
a
little
out
of
the
wanderer
s
reach
as
he
lay
bound
and
said
in
the
phoenician
tongue
mighty
lord
art
thou
some
god
of
javan
for
so
the
sidonians
called
the
achæans
and
wilt
thou
deign
to
taste
our
sacrifice
is
not
the
savour
sweet
in
the
nostrils
of
my
lord
why
will
he
not
put
forth
his
hand
to
touch
our
offering
then
the
heart
of
odysseus
muttered
sullenly
within
him
in
wrath
at
the
insolence
of
the
man
but
he
constrained
himself
and
smiled
and
said
wilt
thou
not
bring
the
mess
a
very
little
nearer
my
friend
that
i
may
smell
the
sweet
incense
of
the
sacrifice
they
were
amazed
when
they
heard
him
speak
in
their
own
tongue
but
he
who
held
the
dish
brought
it
nearer
like
a
man
that
angers
a
dog
now
offering
the
meat
and
now
taking
it
away
so
soon
as
the
man
was
within
reach
the
wanderer
sprang
out
the
loosened
bonds
falling
at
his
feet
and
smote
the
sailor
beneath
the
ear
with
his
clenched
fist
the
blow
was
so
fierce
for
all
his
anger
went
into
it
that
it
crushed
the
bone
and
drove
the
man
against
the
mast
of
the
ship
so
that
the
strong
mast
shook
where
he
fell
there
he
lay
his
feet
kicking
the
floor
of
the
hold
in
his
then
the
wanderer
snatched
from
the
mast
his
bow
and
his
short
sword
slung
the
quiver
about
his
shoulders
and
ran
on
to
the
raised
decking
of
the
prow
the
bulwarks
of
the
deck
were
high
and
the
vessel
was
narrow
and
before
the
sailors
could
stir
for
amazement
the
wanderer
had
taken
his
stand
behind
the
little
altar
and
the
here
he
stood
with
an
arrow
on
the
string
and
the
bow
drawn
to
his
ear
looking
about
him
terribly
now
panic
and
dread
came
on
the
sidonians
when
they
saw
him
standing
thus
and
one
of
the
sailors
cried
alas
what
god
have
we
taken
and
bound
our
ship
may
not
contain
him
surely
he
is
resef
mikal
the
god
of
the
bow
whom
they
of
javan
call
apollo
nay
let
us
land
him
on
the
isle
and
come
not
to
blows
with
him
but
entreat
his
mercy
lest
he
rouse
the
waves
and
the
winds
against
but
the
captain
of
the
ship
of
the
sidonians
cried
not
so
ye
knaves
have
at
him
for
he
is
no
god
but
a
mortal
man
and
his
armour
is
worth
many
a
yoke
of
oxen
then
he
bade
some
of
them
climb
the
decking
at
the
further
end
of
the
ship
and
throw
spears
at
him
thence
and
he
called
others
to
bring
up
one
of
the
long
spears
and
charge
him
with
that
now
these
were
huge
pikes
that
were
wielded
by
five
or
six
men
at
once
and
no
armour
could
withstand
them
they
were
used
in
the
fights
to
drive
back
boarders
and
to
ward
off
attacks
on
ships
which
were
beached
on
shore
in
the
sieges
of
towns
the
men
whom
the
captain
appointed
little
liked
the
task
for
the
long
spears
were
laid
on
tressels
along
the
bulwarks
and
to
reach
them
and
unship
them
it
was
needful
to
come
within
range
of
the
bow
but
the
sailors
on
the
further
deck
threw
all
their
spears
at
once
while
five
men
leaped
on
the
deck
where
the
wanderer
stood
he
loosed
the
bowstring
and
the
shaft
sped
on
its
way
again
he
drew
and
loosed
and
now
two
of
them
had
fallen
beneath
his
arrows
and
one
was
struck
by
a
chance
blow
from
a
spear
thrown
from
the
further
deck
and
the
other
two
leaped
back
into
the
hold
then
the
wanderer
shouted
from
the
high
decking
of
the
prow
in
the
speech
of
the
sidonians
ye
dogs
ye
have
sailed
on
your
latest
seafaring
and
never
again
shall
ye
bring
the
hour
of
slavery
on
any
so
he
cried
and
the
sailors
gathered
together
in
the
hold
and
took
counsel
how
they
should
deal
with
him
but
meanwhile
the
bow
was
silent
and
of
those
on
the
hinder
deck
who
were
casting
spears
one
dropped
and
the
others
quickly
fled
to
their
fellows
below
for
on
the
deck
they
had
no
cover
the
sun
was
now
well
risen
and
shone
on
the
wanderer
s
golden
mail
as
he
stood
alone
on
the
decking
with
his
bow
drawn
the
sun
shone
there
was
silence
the
ship
swung
to
her
anchor
and
still
he
waited
looking
down
his
arrow
pointing
at
the
level
of
the
deck
to
shoot
at
the
first
head
which
rose
above
the
planking
suddenly
there
was
a
rush
of
men
on
to
the
further
decking
and
certain
of
them
tore
the
shields
that
lined
the
bulwarks
from
their
pins
and
threw
them
down
to
those
who
were
below
while
others
cast
a
shower
of
spears
at
the
wanderer
some
of
the
spears
he
avoided
others
leaped
back
from
his
mail
others
stood
fast
in
the
altar
and
in
the
bodies
of
the
while
he
answered
with
an
arrow
that
did
not
miss
its
aim
but
his
eyes
were
always
watching
most
keenly
the
hatches
nearest
him
whence
a
gangway
ran
down
to
the
lower
part
of
the
ship
where
the
oarsmen
sat
for
only
thence
could
they
make
a
rush
on
him
as
he
watched
and
drew
an
arrow
from
the
quiver
on
his
shoulder
he
felt
as
it
were
a
shadow
between
him
and
the
deck
he
glanced
up
quickly
and
there
on
the
yard
above
his
head
a
man
who
had
climbed
the
mast
from
behind
was
creeping
down
to
drop
on
him
from
above
then
the
wanderer
snatched
a
short
spear
and
cast
it
at
the
man
the
spear
sped
quicker
than
a
thought
and
pinned
his
two
hands
to
the
yard
so
that
he
hung
there
helpless
shrieking
to
his
friends
but
the
arrows
of
the
wanderer
kept
raining
on
the
men
who
stood
on
the
further
deck
and
presently
some
of
them
too
leaped
down
in
terror
crying
that
he
was
a
god
and
not
a
man
while
others
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
and
swam
for
the
island
then
the
wanderer
himself
waited
no
longer
seeing
them
all
amazed
but
he
drew
his
sword
and
leaped
down
among
them
with
a
cry
like
a
swooping
on
seamews
in
the
crevice
of
a
rock
to
right
and
left
he
smote
with
the
short
sword
making
a
havoc
and
sparing
none
for
the
sword
ravened
in
his
hand
and
some
fell
over
the
benches
and
oars
but
such
of
the
sailors
as
could
flee
rushed
up
the
gangway
into
the
further
deck
and
thence
sprang
overboard
while
those
who
had
not
the
luck
to
flee
fell
where
they
stood
and
scarcely
struck
a
blow
only
the
captain
of
the
ship
knowing
that
all
was
lost
turned
and
threw
a
spear
in
the
wanderer
s
face
but
he
watched
the
flash
of
the
bronze
and
stooped
his
head
so
that
the
spear
struck
only
the
golden
helm
and
pierced
it
through
but
scarcely
grazed
his
head
now
the
wanderer
sprang
on
the
sidonian
captain
and
smote
him
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
so
that
he
fell
senseless
on
the
deck
and
then
he
bound
him
hand
and
foot
with
cords
as
he
himself
had
been
bound
and
made
him
fast
to
the
iron
bar
in
the
hold
next
he
gathered
up
the
dead
in
his
mighty
arms
and
set
them
against
the
bulwarks
of
the
harvesting
the
fruits
of
war
above
the
deck
the
man
who
had
crept
along
the
yard
was
hanging
by
his
two
hands
which
the
spear
had
pinned
together
to
the
yard
art
thou
there
friend
cried
the
wanderer
mocking
him
hast
thou
chosen
to
stay
with
me
rather
than
go
with
thy
friends
or
seek
new
service
nay
then
as
thou
art
so
staunch
abide
there
and
keep
a
good
for
the
river
mouth
and
the
market
where
thou
shalt
sell
me
for
a
great
so
he
spoke
but
the
man
was
already
dead
of
pain
and
fear
then
the
wanderer
unbuckled
his
golden
armour
which
clanged
upon
the
deck
and
drew
fresh
water
from
the
hold
to
cleanse
himself
for
he
was
stained
like
a
lion
that
has
devoured
an
ox
next
with
a
golden
comb
he
combed
his
long
dark
curls
and
he
gathered
his
arrows
out
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
out
of
the
thwarts
and
the
sides
of
the
ship
cleansed
them
and
laid
them
back
in
the
quiver
when
all
this
was
ended
he
put
on
his
armour
again
but
strong
as
he
was
he
could
not
tear
the
spear
from
the
helm
without
breaking
the
gold
so
he
snapped
the
shaft
and
put
on
the
helmet
with
the
point
of
the
javelin
still
fixed
firm
in
the
crest
as
fate
would
have
it
so
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
his
sorrows
next
he
ate
meat
and
bread
and
drank
wine
and
poured
forth
some
of
the
wine
before
his
gods
lastly
he
dragged
up
the
heavy
stone
with
which
the
ship
was
moored
a
stone
heavier
far
they
say
than
two
other
men
could
lift
he
took
the
tiller
in
his
hand
the
steady
north
wind
the
etesian
wind
kept
blowing
in
the
sails
and
he
steered
straight
southward
for
the
mouths
of
the
nile
iv
the
sea
a
hard
fight
it
had
been
and
a
long
and
the
wanderer
was
weary
he
took
the
tiller
of
the
ship
in
his
hand
and
steered
for
the
south
and
for
the
noonday
sun
which
was
now
at
his
highest
in
the
heavens
but
suddenly
the
bright
light
of
the
sky
was
darkened
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
rush
and
the
murmur
and
the
winnowing
of
innumerable
wings
it
was
as
if
all
the
birds
that
have
their
homes
and
seek
their
food
in
the
great
salt
marsh
of
cayster
had
risen
from
the
south
and
had
flown
over
sea
in
one
hour
for
the
heaven
was
darkened
with
their
flight
and
loud
with
the
call
of
cranes
and
the
whistling
cry
of
the
wild
ducks
so
dark
was
the
thick
mass
of
flying
fowl
that
a
flight
of
swans
shone
snowy
against
the
black
cloud
of
their
wings
at
the
view
of
them
the
wanderer
caught
his
bow
eagerly
into
his
hand
and
set
an
arrow
on
the
string
and
taking
a
careful
aim
at
the
white
wedge
of
birds
he
shot
a
wild
swan
through
the
breast
as
it
swept
high
over
the
mast
then
with
all
the
speed
of
its
rush
the
wild
white
swan
flashed
down
like
lightning
into
the
sea
behind
the
ship
the
wanderer
watched
its
fall
when
lo
the
water
where
the
dead
swan
fell
splashed
up
as
red
as
blood
and
all
afoam
the
long
silver
wings
and
snowy
plumage
floated
on
the
surface
flecked
with
stains
and
the
wanderer
marvelled
as
he
bent
over
the
bulwarks
and
gazed
steadily
upon
the
sea
then
he
saw
that
the
wide
sea
round
the
ship
was
covered
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
as
it
were
with
a
scum
hither
and
thither
the
red
stain
was
tossed
like
foam
yet
beneath
where
the
deep
wave
divided
the
wanderer
saw
that
the
streams
of
the
sea
were
grey
and
green
below
the
crimson
dye
as
he
watched
he
saw
too
that
the
red
froth
was
drifted
always
onward
from
the
south
and
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
of
egypt
for
behind
the
wake
of
the
ship
it
was
most
red
of
all
though
he
had
not
marked
it
when
the
battle
raged
but
in
front
the
colour
grew
thin
as
if
the
stain
that
the
river
washed
down
was
all
but
spent
in
his
heart
the
wanderer
thought
as
any
man
must
have
deemed
that
on
the
banks
of
the
river
of
egypt
there
had
been
some
battle
of
great
nations
and
that
the
war
god
had
raged
furiously
wherefore
the
holy
river
as
it
ran
forth
stained
all
the
sacred
sea
where
war
was
there
was
his
home
no
other
home
had
he
now
and
all
the
more
eagerly
he
steered
right
on
to
see
what
the
gods
would
send
him
the
flight
of
birds
was
over
and
past
it
was
two
hours
after
noon
the
light
was
high
in
the
heaven
when
as
he
gazed
another
shadow
fell
on
him
for
the
sun
in
grew
small
and
red
as
blood
slowly
a
mist
rose
up
over
it
from
the
south
a
mist
that
was
thin
but
as
black
as
night
beyond
to
the
southward
there
was
a
bank
of
cloud
like
a
mountain
wall
steep
and
polished
and
black
tipped
along
the
ragged
crest
with
fire
and
opening
ever
and
again
with
flashes
of
intolerable
splendour
while
the
bases
were
scrawled
over
with
lightning
like
a
written
scroll
never
had
the
wanderer
in
all
his
voyaging
on
the
sea
and
on
the
great
river
oceanus
that
girdles
the
earth
and
severs
the
dead
from
the
living
men
never
had
he
beheld
such
a
darkness
presently
he
came
as
it
were
within
the
jaws
of
it
dark
as
a
wolf
s
mouth
so
dark
that
he
might
not
see
the
corpses
on
the
deck
nor
the
mast
nor
the
dead
man
swinging
from
the
yard
nor
the
captain
of
the
phoenicians
who
groaned
aloud
below
praying
to
his
gods
but
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
there
was
one
break
of
clear
blue
sky
on
the
horizon
in
which
the
little
isle
where
he
had
slain
the
sidonians
might
be
discerned
far
off
as
bright
and
white
as
ivory
now
though
he
knew
it
not
the
gates
of
his
own
world
were
closing
behind
the
wanderer
for
ever
to
the
north
whence
he
came
lay
the
clear
sky
and
the
sunny
capes
and
isles
and
the
airy
mountains
of
the
argive
lands
white
with
the
temples
of
familiar
gods
but
in
face
of
him
to
the
south
whither
he
went
was
a
cloud
of
darkness
and
a
land
of
darkness
itself
there
were
things
to
befall
more
marvellous
than
are
told
in
any
tale
there
was
to
be
a
war
of
the
peoples
and
of
the
gods
the
true
gods
and
the
false
and
there
he
should
find
the
last
embraces
of
love
the
false
love
and
the
true
foreboding
somewhat
of
the
perils
that
lay
in
front
the
wanderer
was
tempted
to
shift
his
course
and
sail
back
to
the
sunlight
but
he
was
one
that
had
never
turned
his
hand
from
the
plough
nor
his
foot
from
the
path
and
he
thought
that
now
his
path
was
so
he
lashed
the
tiller
with
a
rope
and
groped
his
way
with
his
hands
along
the
deck
till
he
reached
the
altar
of
the
where
the
embers
of
the
sacrifice
still
were
glowing
faintly
then
with
his
sword
he
cut
some
and
broken
arrows
into
white
chips
and
with
them
he
filled
a
little
brazier
and
taking
the
seed
of
fire
from
the
altar
set
light
to
it
from
beneath
presently
the
wood
blazed
up
through
the
noonday
night
and
the
fire
flickered
and
flared
on
the
faces
of
the
dead
men
that
lay
about
the
deck
rolling
to
larboard
and
to
starboard
as
the
vessel
lurched
and
the
flame
shone
red
on
the
golden
armour
of
the
wanderer
of
all
his
voyages
this
was
the
strangest
seafaring
he
cruising
alone
with
a
company
of
the
dead
deep
into
a
darkness
without
measure
or
bound
to
a
land
that
might
not
be
descried
strange
gusts
of
sudden
wind
blew
him
hither
and
thither
the
breeze
would
rise
in
a
moment
from
any
quarter
and
die
as
suddenly
as
it
rose
and
another
wind
would
chase
it
over
the
chopping
seas
he
knew
not
if
he
sailed
south
or
north
he
knew
not
how
time
passed
for
there
was
no
sight
of
the
sun
it
was
night
without
a
dawn
yet
his
heart
was
glad
as
if
he
had
been
a
boy
again
for
the
old
sorrows
were
forgotten
so
potent
was
the
draught
of
the
chalice
of
the
goddess
and
so
keen
was
the
delight
of
battle
endure
my
heart
he
cried
as
often
he
had
cried
before
a
worse
thing
than
this
thou
hast
endured
and
he
caught
up
a
lyre
of
the
dead
sidonians
and
sang
though
the
light
of
the
sun
be
hidden
though
his
race
be
run
though
we
sail
in
a
sea
forbidden
to
the
golden
sun
though
we
wander
alone
unknowing
oh
heart
of
mine
the
path
of
the
strange
of
the
brine
yet
endure
we
shall
not
be
shaken
by
things
worse
than
these
we
have
scaped
when
our
friends
were
taken
on
the
unsailed
seas
worse
deaths
have
we
faced
and
fled
from
in
the
cyclops
den
when
the
floor
of
his
cave
ran
red
from
the
blood
of
men
worse
griefs
have
we
known
undaunted
worse
fates
have
fled
when
the
isle
that
our
long
love
haunted
lay
waste
and
dead
so
he
was
chanting
when
he
descried
faint
and
far
off
a
red
glow
cast
up
along
the
darkness
like
sunset
on
the
sky
of
the
for
this
light
he
steered
and
soon
he
saw
two
tall
pillars
of
flame
blazing
beside
each
other
with
a
narrow
space
of
night
between
them
he
helmed
the
ship
towards
these
and
when
he
came
near
them
they
were
like
two
mighty
mountains
of
wood
burning
far
into
heaven
and
each
was
lofty
as
the
pyre
that
blazes
over
men
slain
in
some
red
war
and
each
pile
roared
and
flared
above
a
steep
crag
of
smooth
black
basalt
and
between
the
burning
mounds
of
fire
lay
the
water
of
a
haven
the
ship
neared
the
haven
and
the
wanderer
saw
moving
like
fireflies
through
the
night
the
lanterns
in
the
prows
of
boats
and
from
one
of
the
boats
a
sailor
hailed
him
in
the
speech
of
the
people
of
egypt
asking
him
if
he
desired
a
pilot
yea
he
shouted
the
boat
drew
near
and
the
pilot
came
aboard
a
torch
in
his
hand
but
when
his
eyes
fell
on
the
dead
men
in
the
ship
and
the
horror
hanging
from
the
yard
and
the
captain
bound
to
the
iron
bar
and
above
all
on
the
golden
armour
of
the
hero
and
on
the
fast
in
his
helm
and
on
his
terrible
face
he
shrank
back
in
dread
as
if
the
god
osiris
himself
in
the
ship
of
death
had
reached
the
harbour
but
the
wanderer
bade
him
have
no
fear
telling
him
that
he
came
with
much
wealth
and
with
a
great
gift
for
the
pharaoh
the
pilot
therefore
plucked
up
heart
and
took
the
helm
and
between
the
two
great
hills
of
blazing
fire
the
vessel
glided
into
the
smooth
waters
of
the
river
of
egypt
the
flames
glittering
on
the
wanderer
s
mail
as
he
stood
by
the
mast
and
chanted
the
song
of
the
bow
then
by
the
counsel
of
the
pilot
the
vessel
was
steered
up
the
river
towards
the
temple
of
heracles
in
tanis
where
there
is
a
sanctuary
for
strangers
and
where
no
man
may
harm
them
but
first
the
dead
sidonians
were
cast
overboard
into
the
great
river
for
the
dead
bodies
of
men
are
an
abomination
to
the
egyptians
and
as
each
body
struck
the
water
the
wanderer
saw
a
hateful
sight
for
the
face
of
the
river
was
lashed
into
foam
by
the
sudden
leaping
and
rushing
of
huge
fish
or
so
the
wanderer
deemed
them
the
sound
of
the
heavy
plunging
of
the
great
as
they
darted
forth
on
the
prey
smiting
at
each
other
with
their
tails
and
the
gnashing
of
their
jaws
when
they
bit
too
eagerly
and
only
harmed
the
air
and
the
leap
of
a
greedy
sharp
snout
from
the
waves
even
before
the
dead
man
cast
from
the
ship
had
quite
touched
the
water
these
things
were
horrible
to
see
and
hear
through
the
blackness
and
by
the
firelight
a
river
of
death
it
seemed
haunted
by
the
horrors
that
are
said
to
prey
upon
the
souls
and
bodies
of
the
dead
for
the
first
time
the
heart
of
the
wanderer
died
within
him
at
the
horror
of
the
darkness
and
of
this
dread
river
and
of
the
that
dwelt
within
it
then
he
remembered
how
the
birds
had
fled
in
terror
from
this
place
and
he
bethought
him
of
the
sea
when
the
dead
men
were
all
cast
overboard
and
the
river
was
once
more
still
the
wanderer
spoke
sick
at
heart
and
inquired
of
the
pilot
why
the
sea
had
run
so
red
and
whether
war
was
in
the
land
and
why
there
was
night
over
all
that
country
the
fellow
answered
that
there
was
no
war
but
peace
yet
the
land
was
strangely
plagued
with
frogs
and
locusts
and
lice
in
all
their
coasts
the
sacred
river
sihor
running
red
for
three
whole
days
and
now
at
last
for
this
the
third
day
darkness
over
all
the
world
but
as
to
the
cause
of
these
curses
the
pilot
knew
nothing
being
a
plain
man
only
the
story
went
among
the
people
that
the
gods
were
angry
with
khem
as
they
call
egypt
which
indeed
was
easy
to
see
for
those
things
could
come
only
from
the
gods
but
why
they
were
angered
the
pilot
knew
not
still
it
was
commonly
thought
that
the
divine
hathor
the
goddess
of
love
was
wroth
because
of
the
worship
given
in
tanis
to
one
they
called
the
strange
hathor
a
goddess
or
a
woman
of
wonderful
beauty
whose
temple
was
in
tanis
concerning
her
the
pilot
said
that
many
years
ago
some
thirty
years
she
had
first
appeared
in
the
country
coming
none
knew
whence
and
had
been
worshipped
in
tanis
and
had
again
departed
as
mysteriously
as
she
came
but
now
she
had
once
more
chosen
to
appear
visible
to
men
strangely
and
to
dwell
in
her
temple
and
the
men
who
beheld
her
could
do
nothing
but
worship
her
for
her
beauty
whether
she
was
a
mortal
woman
or
a
goddess
the
pilot
did
not
know
only
he
thought
that
she
who
dwells
in
atarhechis
hathor
of
khem
the
queen
of
love
was
angry
with
the
strange
hathor
and
had
sent
the
darkness
and
the
plagues
to
punish
them
who
worshipped
her
the
people
of
the
seaboard
also
murmured
that
it
would
be
well
to
pray
the
strange
hathor
to
depart
out
of
their
coasts
if
she
were
a
goddess
and
if
she
were
a
woman
to
stone
her
with
stones
but
the
people
of
tanis
vowed
that
they
would
rather
die
one
and
all
than
do
aught
but
adore
the
incomparable
beauty
of
their
strange
goddess
others
again
held
that
two
wizards
leaders
of
certain
slaves
of
a
strange
race
wanderers
from
the
desert
settled
in
tanis
whom
they
called
the
apura
caused
all
these
sorrows
by
as
if
forsooth
said
the
pilot
those
barbarian
slaves
were
more
powerful
than
all
the
priests
of
egypt
but
for
his
part
the
pilot
knew
nothing
only
that
if
the
divine
hathor
were
angry
with
the
people
of
tanis
it
was
hard
that
she
must
plague
all
the
land
of
khem
so
the
pilot
murmured
and
his
tale
was
none
of
the
shortest
but
even
as
he
spoke
the
darkness
grew
less
dark
and
the
cloud
lifted
a
little
so
that
the
shores
of
the
river
might
be
seen
in
a
green
light
like
the
light
of
hades
and
presently
the
night
was
rolled
up
like
a
veil
and
it
was
living
noonday
in
the
land
of
khem
then
all
the
noise
of
life
broke
forth
in
one
moment
the
kine
lowing
the
wind
swaying
the
feathery
palms
the
fish
splashing
in
the
stream
men
crying
to
each
other
from
the
river
banks
and
the
voice
of
multitudes
of
people
in
every
red
temple
praising
ra
their
great
god
whose
dwelling
is
the
sun
the
wanderer
too
praised
his
own
gods
and
gave
thanks
to
apollo
and
to
helios
hyperion
and
to
aphrodite
and
in
the
end
the
pilot
brought
the
ship
to
the
quay
of
a
great
city
and
there
a
crew
of
oarsmen
was
hired
and
they
sped
rejoicing
in
the
sunlight
through
a
canal
dug
by
the
hands
of
men
to
tanis
and
the
sanctuary
of
heracles
the
safety
of
strangers
there
the
ship
was
moored
there
the
wanderer
rested
having
a
good
welcome
from
the
shaven
priests
of
the
temple
v
meriamun
the
queen
strange
news
flies
fast
it
was
not
long
before
the
pharaoh
who
then
was
with
his
court
in
tanis
the
newly
rebuilded
city
heard
how
there
had
come
to
khem
a
man
like
a
god
wearing
golden
armour
and
cruising
alone
in
a
ship
of
the
dead
in
these
years
the
white
barbarians
of
the
sea
and
of
the
isles
were
wont
to
land
in
egypt
to
ravage
the
fields
carry
women
captive
and
fly
again
in
their
ships
but
not
one
of
them
had
dared
to
sail
in
the
armour
of
the
aquaiusha
as
the
egyptians
named
the
achæans
right
up
the
river
to
the
city
of
pharaoh
the
king
therefore
was
amazed
at
the
story
and
when
he
heard
that
the
stranger
had
taken
sanctuary
in
the
temple
of
heracles
he
sent
instantly
for
his
chief
counsellor
this
was
his
master
builder
who
bore
a
high
title
in
the
land
an
ancient
priest
named
rei
he
had
served
through
the
long
reign
of
the
king
s
father
the
divine
rameses
the
second
and
he
was
beloved
both
of
meneptah
and
of
meriamun
his
queen
him
the
king
charged
to
visit
the
sanctuary
and
bring
the
stranger
before
him
so
rei
called
for
his
mule
and
rode
down
to
the
temple
of
heracles
beyond
the
walls
when
rei
came
thither
a
priest
went
before
him
and
led
him
to
the
chamber
where
the
warrior
chanced
to
be
eating
the
lily
bread
of
the
land
and
drinking
the
wine
of
the
delta
he
rose
as
rei
entered
and
he
was
still
clad
in
his
golden
armour
for
as
yet
he
had
not
any
change
of
raiment
beside
him
on
a
bronze
tripod
lay
his
helmet
the
achæan
helmet
with
its
two
horns
and
with
the
bronze
still
fast
in
the
gold
the
eyes
of
rei
the
priest
fell
on
the
helmet
and
he
gazed
so
strangely
at
it
that
he
scarcely
heard
the
wanderer
s
salutation
at
length
he
answered
courteously
but
always
his
eyes
wandered
back
to
the
broken
is
this
thine
my
son
he
asked
taking
it
in
his
hand
while
his
voice
trembled
it
is
my
own
said
the
wanderer
though
the
in
it
was
lent
me
of
late
in
return
for
arrows
not
a
few
and
certain
and
he
smiled
the
ancient
priest
bade
the
temple
servants
retire
and
as
they
went
they
heard
him
murmuring
a
prayer
the
dead
spoke
truth
he
muttered
still
gazing
from
the
helmet
in
his
hand
to
the
wanderer
ay
the
dead
speak
seldom
but
they
never
my
son
thou
hast
eaten
and
drunk
then
said
rei
the
priest
and
master
builder
and
may
an
old
man
ask
whence
thou
camest
where
is
thy
native
city
and
who
are
thy
parents
i
come
from
alybas
answered
the
wanderer
for
his
own
name
was
too
widely
known
and
he
loved
an
artful
tale
i
come
from
alybas
i
am
the
son
of
apheidas
son
of
polypemon
and
my
own
name
is
and
wherefore
comest
thou
here
alone
in
a
ship
of
dead
men
and
with
more
treasure
than
a
king
s
ransom
it
was
men
of
sidon
who
laboured
and
died
for
all
that
cargo
said
the
wanderer
they
voyaged
far
for
it
and
toiled
hard
but
they
lost
it
in
an
hour
for
they
were
not
content
with
what
they
had
but
made
me
a
prisoner
as
i
lay
asleep
on
the
coast
of
crete
but
the
gods
gave
me
the
upper
hand
of
them
and
i
bring
their
captain
and
much
white
metal
and
many
swords
and
cups
and
beautiful
woven
stuffs
as
a
gift
to
your
king
and
for
thy
courtesy
come
with
me
and
choose
a
gift
for
then
he
led
the
old
man
to
the
of
the
temple
which
was
rich
in
the
offerings
of
many
travellers
gold
and
turquoise
and
frankincense
from
sinai
and
punt
great
horns
of
carved
ivory
from
the
unknown
east
and
south
bowls
and
baths
of
silver
from
the
khita
who
were
the
allies
of
egypt
but
amidst
all
the
wealth
the
stranger
s
cargo
made
a
goodly
show
and
the
old
priest
s
eyes
glittered
as
he
looked
at
it
take
thy
choice
i
pray
thee
said
the
wanderer
the
spoils
of
foemen
are
the
share
of
the
priest
would
have
refused
but
the
wanderer
saw
that
he
looked
ever
at
a
bowl
of
transparent
amber
from
the
northern
seas
that
was
embossed
with
curious
figures
of
men
and
gods
and
huge
fishes
such
as
are
unknown
in
the
midland
waters
the
wanderer
put
it
into
the
hands
of
rei
thou
shalt
keep
this
he
said
and
pledge
me
in
wine
from
it
when
i
am
gone
in
memory
of
a
friend
and
a
rei
took
the
bowl
and
thanked
him
holding
it
up
to
the
light
to
admire
the
golden
colour
we
are
always
children
he
said
smiling
gravely
see
an
old
child
whom
thou
hast
made
happy
with
a
toy
but
we
are
men
too
soon
again
the
king
bids
thee
come
with
me
before
him
and
my
son
if
thou
wouldst
please
me
more
than
by
any
gift
i
pray
thee
pluck
that
from
thy
helmet
before
thou
comest
into
the
presence
of
the
pardon
me
said
the
wanderer
i
would
not
harm
my
helmet
by
tearing
it
roughly
out
and
i
have
no
smith
s
tools
here
the
my
father
is
a
witness
to
the
truth
of
my
tale
and
for
one
day
more
or
two
i
must
wear
rei
sighed
bowed
his
head
folded
his
hands
and
prayed
to
his
god
amen
saying
o
amen
in
whose
hand
is
the
end
of
a
matter
lighten
the
burden
of
these
sorrows
and
let
the
vision
be
easy
of
accomplishment
and
i
pray
thee
o
amen
let
thy
hand
be
light
on
thy
daughter
meriamun
the
lady
of
then
the
old
man
led
the
wanderer
out
and
bade
the
priests
make
ready
a
chariot
for
him
and
so
they
went
through
tanis
to
the
court
of
meneptah
behind
them
followed
the
priests
carrying
gifts
that
the
wanderer
had
chosen
from
the
treasures
of
the
sidonians
and
the
miserable
captain
of
the
sidonians
was
dragged
along
after
them
bound
to
the
hinder
part
of
a
chariot
through
the
gazing
crowd
they
all
passed
on
to
the
hall
of
audience
where
between
the
great
pillars
sat
pharaoh
on
his
golden
throne
beside
him
at
his
right
hand
was
meriamun
the
beautiful
queen
who
looked
at
the
priests
with
weary
eyes
as
if
at
a
matter
in
which
she
had
no
concern
they
came
in
and
beat
the
earth
with
their
brows
before
the
king
first
came
the
officers
leading
the
captain
of
the
sidonians
for
a
gift
to
pharaoh
and
the
king
smiled
graciously
and
accepted
the
slave
then
came
others
bearing
the
cups
of
gold
fashioned
like
the
heads
of
lions
and
rams
and
the
swords
with
pictures
of
wars
and
huntings
echoed
on
their
blades
in
gold
and
the
necklets
of
amber
from
the
north
which
the
wanderer
had
chosen
as
gifts
for
pharaoh
s
queen
and
pharaoh
he
had
silks
too
embroidered
in
gold
and
needlework
of
sidonian
women
and
all
these
the
queen
meriamun
touched
to
show
her
acceptance
of
them
and
smiled
graciously
and
wearily
but
the
covetous
sidonian
groaned
when
he
saw
his
wealth
departing
from
him
the
gains
for
which
he
had
hazarded
his
life
in
unsailed
seas
lastly
pharaoh
bade
them
lead
the
wanderer
in
before
his
presence
and
he
came
unhelmeted
in
all
his
splendour
the
goodliest
man
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
khem
he
was
of
no
great
height
but
very
great
of
girth
and
of
strength
unmatched
and
with
the
face
of
one
who
had
seen
what
few
have
seen
and
lived
the
beauty
of
youth
was
gone
from
him
but
his
face
had
the
comeliness
of
a
warrior
tried
on
sea
and
land
the
eyes
were
of
a
valour
invincible
and
no
woman
could
see
him
but
she
longed
to
be
his
love
as
he
entered
murmurs
of
amazement
passed
over
all
the
company
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
save
only
the
weary
and
wandering
eyes
of
the
listless
meriamun
but
when
she
chanced
to
lift
her
face
and
gaze
on
him
they
who
watch
the
looks
of
kings
and
queens
saw
her
turn
grey
as
the
dead
and
clutch
with
her
hand
at
her
side
pharaoh
himself
saw
this
though
he
was
not
quick
to
mark
what
passed
and
he
asked
her
if
anything
ailed
her
but
she
answered
nay
only
methinks
the
air
is
sick
with
heat
and
perfume
greet
thou
this
but
beneath
her
robe
her
fingers
were
fretting
all
the
while
at
the
golden
fringes
of
her
throne
welcome
thou
wanderer
cried
pharaoh
in
a
deep
and
heavy
voice
welcome
by
what
name
art
thou
named
and
where
dwell
thy
people
and
what
is
thy
native
land
bowing
low
before
pharaoh
the
wanderer
answered
with
a
feigned
tale
that
his
name
was
eperitus
of
alybas
the
son
of
apheidas
the
rest
of
the
story
and
how
he
had
been
taken
by
the
sidonians
and
how
he
had
smitten
them
on
the
seas
he
told
as
he
had
told
it
to
rei
and
he
displayed
his
helmet
with
the
fast
in
it
but
when
she
saw
this
meriamun
rose
to
her
feet
as
if
she
would
be
gone
and
then
fell
back
into
her
seat
even
paler
than
before
the
queen
help
the
queen
she
faints
cried
rei
the
priest
whose
eyes
had
never
left
her
face
one
of
her
ladies
a
beautiful
woman
ran
to
her
knelt
before
her
and
chafed
her
hands
till
she
came
to
herself
and
sat
up
with
angry
eyes
let
be
she
said
and
let
the
slave
who
tends
the
incense
be
beaten
on
the
feet
nay
i
will
remain
here
i
will
not
to
my
chamber
let
be
and
her
lady
drew
back
afraid
then
pharaoh
bade
men
lead
the
sidonian
out
and
slay
him
in
the
for
his
treachery
but
the
man
whose
name
was
kurri
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
wanderer
praying
for
his
life
the
wanderer
was
merciful
when
the
rage
of
battle
was
over
and
his
blood
was
cool
a
boon
o
pharaoh
meneptah
he
cried
spare
me
this
man
he
saved
my
own
life
when
the
crew
would
have
cast
me
overboard
let
me
pay
my
let
him
be
spared
as
thou
wilt
have
it
so
spoke
pharaoh
but
revenge
dogs
the
feet
of
foolish
mercy
and
many
debts
are
paid
ere
all
is
thus
it
chanced
that
kurri
was
given
to
meriamun
to
be
her
jeweller
and
to
work
for
her
in
gold
and
silver
to
the
wanderer
was
allotted
a
chamber
in
the
royal
palace
for
the
pharaoh
trusted
that
he
would
be
a
leader
of
his
guard
and
took
great
pleasure
in
his
beauty
and
his
strength
as
he
left
the
hall
of
audience
with
rei
the
queen
meriamun
lifted
her
eyes
again
and
looked
on
him
long
and
her
ivory
face
flushed
rosy
like
the
ivory
that
the
sidonians
dye
red
for
the
trappings
of
the
horses
of
kings
but
the
wanderer
marked
both
the
sudden
fear
and
the
blush
of
meriamun
and
beautiful
as
she
was
he
liked
it
ill
and
his
heart
foreboded
evil
when
he
was
alone
with
rei
therefore
he
spoke
to
him
of
this
and
prayed
the
old
man
to
tell
him
if
he
could
guess
at
all
the
meaning
of
the
queen
for
to
me
he
said
it
was
as
if
the
lady
knew
my
face
and
even
as
if
she
feared
it
but
i
never
saw
her
like
in
all
my
wanderings
beautiful
she
is
and
yet
but
it
is
ill
speaking
in
their
own
land
of
kings
and
queens
at
first
when
the
wanderer
spoke
thus
rei
put
it
by
smiling
but
the
wanderer
seeing
that
he
was
troubled
and
remembering
how
he
had
prayed
him
to
pluck
the
from
his
helmet
pressed
him
hard
with
questions
thus
partly
out
of
weariness
and
partly
for
love
of
him
and
also
because
a
secret
had
long
been
burning
in
his
heart
the
old
man
took
the
wanderer
into
his
own
room
in
the
palace
and
there
he
told
him
all
the
story
of
meriamun
the
queen
vi
the
story
of
meriamun
rei
the
priest
of
amen
the
master
builder
began
his
story
unwillingly
enough
and
slowly
but
soon
he
took
pleasure
in
telling
it
as
old
men
do
and
in
sharing
the
burden
of
a
secret
the
queen
is
fair
he
said
thou
hast
seen
no
fairer
in
all
thy
voyagings
she
is
fair
indeed
answered
the
wanderer
i
pray
that
she
be
and
happy
on
her
throne
that
is
what
i
will
tell
thee
of
though
my
life
may
be
the
price
of
the
tale
said
rei
but
a
lighter
heart
is
well
worth
an
old
man
s
cheap
risk
and
thou
may
st
help
me
and
her
when
thou
knowest
all
pharaoh
meneptah
her
lord
the
king
is
the
son
of
the
divine
rameses
the
pharaoh
child
of
the
sun
who
dwelleth
in
thou
meanest
that
he
is
dead
asked
the
wanderer
he
dwelleth
with
osiris
said
the
priest
and
the
queen
meriamun
was
his
daughter
by
another
a
brother
wed
a
sister
exclaimed
the
wanderer
it
is
the
custom
of
our
royal
house
from
the
days
of
the
timeless
kings
the
children
of
horus
an
old
the
ways
of
his
hosts
are
good
in
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
said
the
wanderer
courteously
it
is
an
old
custom
and
a
sacred
said
rei
but
women
the
are
often
and
of
all
women
meriamun
least
loves
to
be
obedient
even
to
the
dead
and
yet
she
has
obeyed
and
it
came
about
thus
her
brother
meneptah
who
now
is
pharaoh
the
prince
of
kush
while
her
divine
father
lived
had
many
but
meriamun
was
the
fairest
of
them
all
she
is
beautiful
a
the
common
people
called
her
and
wise
and
she
does
not
know
the
face
of
fear
and
thus
it
chanced
that
she
learned
what
even
our
royal
women
rarely
learn
all
the
ancient
secret
wisdom
of
this
ancient
land
except
queen
taia
of
old
no
woman
has
known
what
meriamun
knows
what
i
have
taught
her
i
and
another
he
paused
here
and
his
mind
seemed
to
turn
on
unhappy
things
i
have
taught
her
from
childhood
he
went
on
would
that
i
had
been
her
only
familiar
and
after
her
divine
father
and
mother
she
loved
me
more
than
any
for
she
loved
few
but
of
all
whom
she
did
not
love
she
loved
her
royal
brother
least
he
is
slow
of
speech
and
she
is
quick
she
is
fearless
and
he
has
no
heart
for
war
from
her
childhood
she
scorned
him
mocked
him
and
mastered
him
with
her
tongue
she
even
learned
to
excel
him
in
the
chariot
races
therefore
it
was
that
the
king
his
father
made
him
but
a
general
of
the
foot
soldiers
and
in
guessing
riddles
which
our
people
love
she
delighted
to
conquer
him
the
victory
was
easy
enough
for
the
divine
prince
is
but
meriamun
was
never
tired
of
girding
at
him
plainly
even
as
a
little
child
she
grudged
that
he
should
come
to
wield
the
scourge
of
power
and
wear
the
double
crown
while
she
should
live
in
idleness
and
hunger
for
it
is
strange
then
that
of
all
his
sisters
if
one
must
be
queen
he
should
have
chosen
her
said
the
wanderer
strange
and
it
happened
strangely
the
prince
s
father
the
divine
rameses
had
willed
the
marriage
the
prince
hated
it
no
less
than
meriamun
but
the
will
of
a
father
is
the
will
of
the
gods
in
one
sport
the
divine
prince
excelled
in
the
game
of
pieces
an
old
game
in
khem
it
is
no
pastime
for
women
but
even
at
this
meriamun
was
determined
to
master
her
brother
she
bade
me
carve
her
a
new
set
of
the
pieces
fashioned
with
the
heads
of
cats
and
shaped
from
the
hard
wood
of
azebi
i
carved
them
with
my
own
hands
and
night
by
night
she
played
with
me
who
have
some
name
for
skill
at
the
sport
cyprus
one
sunset
it
chanced
that
her
brother
came
in
from
hunting
the
lion
in
the
libyan
hills
he
was
in
an
evil
humour
for
he
had
found
no
lions
and
he
caused
the
huntsmen
to
be
stretched
out
and
beaten
with
rods
then
he
called
for
wine
and
drank
deep
at
the
palace
gate
and
the
deeper
he
drank
the
darker
grew
his
humour
he
was
going
to
his
own
court
in
the
palace
striking
with
a
whip
at
his
hounds
when
he
chanced
to
turn
and
see
meriamun
she
was
sitting
where
those
three
great
are
and
was
playing
at
pieces
with
me
in
the
cool
of
the
day
there
she
sat
in
the
shadow
clad
in
white
and
purple
and
with
the
red
gold
of
the
snake
of
royalty
in
the
blackness
of
her
hair
there
she
sat
as
beautiful
as
the
hathor
the
queen
of
love
or
as
the
lady
isis
when
she
played
at
pieces
in
amenti
with
the
ancient
king
nay
an
old
man
may
say
it
there
never
was
but
one
woman
more
fair
than
meriamun
if
a
woman
she
be
she
whom
our
people
call
the
now
the
wanderer
bethought
him
of
the
tale
of
the
pilot
but
he
said
nothing
and
rei
went
on
the
prince
saw
her
and
his
anger
sought
for
something
new
to
break
itself
on
up
he
came
and
i
rose
before
him
and
bowed
myself
but
meriamun
fell
indolently
back
in
her
chair
of
ivory
and
with
a
sweep
of
her
slim
hand
she
disordered
the
pieces
and
bade
her
waiting
woman
the
lady
hataska
gather
up
the
board
and
carry
all
away
but
hataska
s
eyes
were
secretly
watching
the
prince
greeting
princess
our
royal
sister
said
meneptah
what
art
thou
doing
with
these
and
he
pointed
with
his
chariot
whip
at
the
pieces
this
is
no
woman
s
game
these
pieces
are
not
soft
hearts
of
men
to
be
moved
on
the
board
by
love
this
game
needs
wit
get
thee
to
thy
broidery
for
there
thou
may
st
greeting
prince
our
royal
brother
said
meriamun
i
laugh
to
hear
thee
speak
of
a
game
that
needs
wit
thy
hunting
has
not
prospered
so
get
thee
to
the
banquet
board
for
there
i
hear
the
gods
have
granted
thee
to
it
is
little
to
say
answered
the
prince
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
whence
i
had
risen
it
is
little
to
say
but
at
the
game
of
pieces
i
have
enough
wit
to
give
thee
a
temple
a
priest
and
five
bowmen
and
yet
win
for
these
o
wanderer
are
the
names
of
some
of
the
pieces
i
take
the
challenge
cried
meriamun
for
now
she
had
brought
him
where
she
wanted
but
i
will
take
no
odds
here
is
my
wager
i
will
play
thee
three
games
and
stake
the
sacred
circlet
upon
my
brow
against
the
royal
uraeus
on
thine
and
the
winner
shall
wear
nay
nay
lady
i
was
bold
to
say
this
were
too
high
a
high
or
low
i
accept
the
wager
answered
the
prince
this
sister
of
mine
has
mocked
me
too
long
she
shall
find
that
her
woman
s
wit
can
not
match
me
at
my
own
game
and
that
my
father
s
son
the
royal
prince
of
kush
and
the
pharaoh
who
shall
be
is
more
than
the
equal
of
a
girl
i
hold
thy
wage
meriamun
go
then
prince
she
cried
and
after
sunset
meet
me
in
my
antechamber
bring
a
scribe
to
score
the
games
rei
shall
be
the
judge
and
hold
the
stakes
but
beware
of
the
golden
cup
of
pasht
drain
it
not
lest
i
win
a
though
we
do
not
play
for
love
the
prince
went
scowling
away
and
meriamun
laughed
but
i
foresaw
mischief
the
stakes
were
too
high
the
match
was
too
strange
but
meriamun
would
not
listen
to
me
for
she
was
very
wilful
the
sun
fell
and
two
hours
after
the
royal
prince
of
kush
came
with
his
scribe
and
found
meriamun
with
the
board
of
squares
before
her
in
her
antechamber
he
sat
down
without
a
word
then
he
asked
who
should
first
take
the
field
wait
she
said
first
let
us
set
the
stakes
and
lifting
from
her
brow
the
golden
snake
of
royalty
she
shook
her
soft
hair
loose
and
gave
the
coronet
to
me
if
i
lose
she
said
never
may
i
wear
the
uraeus
that
shalt
thou
never
while
i
draw
breath
answered
the
prince
as
he
too
lifted
the
symbol
of
his
royalty
from
his
head
and
gave
it
to
me
there
was
a
difference
between
the
circlets
the
coronet
of
meriamun
was
crowned
with
one
crested
snake
that
of
the
divine
prince
was
crowned
with
twain
ay
meneptah
she
said
but
perchance
osiris
god
of
the
dead
waits
thee
for
surely
he
loves
those
too
great
and
good
for
earth
take
thou
the
field
and
to
the
at
her
words
of
evil
omen
he
frowned
but
he
took
the
field
and
readily
for
he
knew
the
game
well
she
moved
in
answer
heedlessly
enough
and
afterwards
she
played
at
random
and
carelessly
pushing
the
pieces
about
with
little
skill
and
so
he
won
this
first
game
quickly
and
crying
is
swept
the
pieces
from
the
board
see
how
i
better
thee
he
went
on
in
mockery
thine
is
a
woman
s
game
all
attack
and
no
boast
not
yet
meneptah
she
said
there
are
still
two
sets
to
play
see
the
board
is
set
and
i
take
the
this
time
the
game
went
differently
for
the
prince
could
scarce
make
a
prisoner
of
a
single
piece
save
of
one
temple
and
two
bowmen
only
and
presently
it
was
the
turn
of
meriamun
to
cry
is
and
to
sweep
the
pieces
from
the
board
this
time
meneptah
did
not
boast
but
scowled
while
i
set
the
board
and
the
scribe
wrote
down
the
game
upon
his
tablets
now
it
was
the
prince
s
turn
to
take
the
field
in
the
name
of
holy
thoth
he
cried
to
whom
i
vow
great
gifts
of
in
the
name
of
holy
pasht
she
made
answer
to
whom
i
make
daily
for
being
a
maid
she
swore
by
the
goddess
of
chastity
and
being
meriamun
by
the
goddess
of
vengeance
tis
fitting
thou
should
st
vow
by
her
of
the
cat
s
head
he
said
sneering
yes
very
fitting
she
answered
for
perchance
she
ll
lend
me
her
claws
play
thou
prince
and
he
played
and
so
well
that
for
a
while
the
game
went
against
her
but
at
length
when
they
had
struggled
long
and
meriamun
had
lost
the
most
of
her
pieces
a
light
came
into
her
face
as
though
she
had
found
what
she
sought
and
while
the
prince
called
for
wine
and
drank
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
looked
upon
the
board
then
she
moved
so
shrewdly
and
upon
so
deep
a
plan
that
he
fell
into
the
trap
that
she
had
laid
for
him
and
could
never
escape
in
vain
he
vowed
gifts
to
the
holy
thoth
and
promised
such
a
temple
as
there
was
none
in
khem
thoth
hears
thee
not
he
is
the
god
of
lettered
men
said
meriamun
mocking
him
then
he
cursed
and
drank
more
wine
fools
seek
wit
in
wine
but
only
wise
men
find
it
quoth
she
again
behold
royal
brother
is
and
i
have
won
the
match
and
beaten
thee
at
thine
own
game
rei
my
servant
give
me
that
circlet
nay
not
my
own
the
double
one
which
the
divine
prince
wagered
so
set
it
on
my
brow
for
it
is
mine
meneptah
in
this
as
in
all
things
else
i
have
conquered
and
she
rose
and
standing
full
in
the
light
of
the
lamps
the
royal
uraeus
on
her
brow
she
mocked
him
bidding
him
come
do
homage
to
her
who
had
won
his
crown
and
stretching
forth
her
small
hand
for
him
to
kiss
it
and
so
wondrous
was
her
beauty
that
the
divine
prince
of
kush
ceased
to
call
upon
the
evil
gods
because
of
his
ill
fortune
and
stood
gazing
on
her
by
ptah
but
thou
art
fair
he
cried
and
i
pardon
my
father
at
last
for
willing
thee
to
be
my
queen
but
i
will
never
pardon
him
said
meriamun
now
the
prince
had
drunk
much
wine
thou
shalt
be
my
queen
he
said
and
for
earnest
i
will
kiss
thee
this
at
the
least
being
the
strongest
i
can
and
ere
she
could
escape
him
he
passed
his
arm
about
her
and
seized
her
by
the
girdle
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
let
her
go
meriamun
grew
white
as
the
dead
by
her
side
there
hung
a
dagger
swiftly
she
drew
it
and
swiftly
struck
at
his
heart
so
that
had
he
not
shrunk
from
the
steel
surely
he
had
been
slain
and
she
cried
as
she
struck
thus
prince
i
pay
thy
kisses
but
as
it
chanced
she
only
pierced
his
arm
and
before
she
could
strike
again
i
had
seized
her
by
the
hand
thou
serpent
said
the
prince
pale
with
rage
and
fear
i
tell
thee
i
will
kiss
thee
yet
whether
thou
wilt
or
not
and
thou
shalt
pay
for
but
she
laughed
softly
now
that
her
anger
was
spent
and
i
led
him
forth
to
seek
a
physician
who
should
bind
up
his
wound
and
when
he
was
gone
i
returned
and
spoke
to
her
wringing
my
hands
oh
royal
lady
what
hast
thou
done
thou
knowest
well
that
thy
divine
father
destines
thee
to
wed
the
prince
of
kush
whom
but
now
thou
didst
smite
so
nay
rei
i
will
none
of
him
the
dull
clod
who
is
called
the
son
of
pharaoh
moreover
he
is
my
and
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
wed
my
brother
for
nature
cries
aloud
against
the
custom
of
the
nevertheless
lady

custom
of
thy
royal
house
and
thy
father

will
thus
the
gods

to
osiris
thus
great
thothmes
and
amenemhat

their
forefathers

all
their
seed
oh

speak
it
for
thine
ear
for
i
love
thee

daughter

thee
for
thou
canst
not
escape
that
pharaoh
s
bed

the
step

throne

the
gate
of
power
and
mayhap
upon
a
time
the
master
of
the
gate
shall
be
gone
and
thou
shalt
sit
in
the
gate
ah
rei
now
thou
speakest
like
the
counsellor
of
those
who
would
be
kings
oh
did
i
not
hate
him
with
this
hatred
and
yet
can
i
rule
him
why
twas
no
chance
game
that
we
played
this
night

future

upon
the
board

his
diadem
is
upon
my
brow
at
first

won
for

chose
that
he
should
win
well
so
mayhap
it
shall
be

i
shall
give
myself
to
him

while
and
then
the
next
game
that

be
for
life
and
love
and
all
things

and
i
shall
win
it
and
mine
shall
be
the
uraeus

shall
rule
like
hatshepu
the
great
queen
of
old
for
i
am
strong
and
to
the
strong
is
yes
i
made
answer
but
lady
see
thou
that
the
gods
turn
not
thy
strength
to
weakness
thou
art
too
passionate
to
be
all
strength
and
in
a
woman
s
heart
passion
is
the
door
by
which
king
folly
enters
thou
hatest
beware
lest
thou
should
st
love
she
said
gazing
scornfully
meriamun
loves
not
till
she
find
a
man
worthy
of
her
ay
and
then
and
then
she
loves
to
all
destruction
and
woe
to
them
who
cross
her
path
rei
then
suddenly
she
spoke
to
me
in
another
tongue
that
few
know
save
her
and
me
and
that
none
can
read
save
her
and
me
a
dead
tongue
of
a
dead
people
the
people
of
that
ancient
city
of
the
rock
whence
all
our
fathers
came
probably
the
mysterious
and
indecipherable
ancient
books
which
were
occasionally
excavated
in
old
egypt
were
written
in
this
dead
language
of
a
more
ancient
and
now
forgotten
people
such
was
the
book
discovered
at
coptos
in
the
sanctuary
there
by
a
priest
of
the
goddess
the
whole
earth
was
dark
but
the
moon
shone
all
about
the
a
scribe
of
the
period
of
the
ramessids
mentions
another
indecipherable
ancient
writing
thou
tellest
me
thou
understandest
no
word
of
it
good
or
bad
there
is
as
it
were
a
wall
about
it
that
none
may
climb
thou
art
instructed
yet
thou
knowest
it
not
this
makes
me

she
said
and
i
trembled
as
she
spoke
for
no
man
speaks
in
this
language
when
he
has
any
good
thought
in
his
heart
i
go
to
seek
the
counsel
of
that
thou
knowest
and
she
touched
the
golden
snake
which
she
had
won
then
i
threw
myself
on
the
earth
at
her
feet
and
clasped
her
knees
crying
my
daughter
my
daughter
sin
not
this
great
sin
nay
for
all
the
kingdom
of
the
world
wake
not
that
which
sleepeth
nor
warm
again
into
life
that
which
is
but
she
only
nodded
and
put
me
from
her
and
the
old
man
s
face
grew
pale
as
he
spoke
what
meant
she
said
the
wanderer
nay
wake
not
that
which
sleepeth
wanderer
he
said
at
length
my
tongue
is
sealed
i
tell
thee
more
that
i
would
tell
another
do
not
ask
but
hark
they
come
again
now
may
ra

and
amen
curse
them
may
the
red
swine

mouth
of

gnaw
upon

in

may
the

and
feed
and
feed
again
why
dost
thou
curse
thus
rei
and
who
are
they
that
go
by
said
the
wanderer
i
hear
their
tramping
and
their
indeed
there
came
a
light
noise
of
many
shuffling
feet
pattering
outside
the
palace
wall
and
the
words
of
a
song
rang
out
triumphantly
the
lord
our
god
he
doth
sign
and
wonder
tokens
he
shows
in
the
land
of
khem
he
hath
shattered
the
pride
of
the
kings
asunder
and
casteth
his
shoe
o
er
the
gods
of
them
he
hath
brought
forth
frogs
in
their
holy
places
he
hath
sprinkled
the
dust
upon
crown
and
hem
he
hath
hated
their
kings
and
hath
darkened
their
faces
wonders
he
works
in
the
land
of
khem
these
are
the
accursed
blaspheming
conjurors
and
slaves
the
apura
said
rei
as
the
music
and
the
tramping
died
away
their
magic
is
greater
than
the
lore
even
of
us
who
are
instructed
for
their
leader
was
one
of
ourselves
a
shaven
priest
and
knows
our
wisdom
never
do
they
march
and
sing
thus
but
evil
comes
of
it
ere
day
dawn
we
shall
have
news
of
them
may
the
gods
destroy
them
they
are
gone
for
the
hour
it
were
well
if
meriamun
the
queen
would
let
them
go
for
ever
as
they
desire
to
their
death
in
the
desert
but
she
hardens
the
king
s
vii
the
queen
s
vision
there
was
silence
without
at
last
the
clamour
and
the
tread
of
the
apura
were
hushed
in
the
distance
dying
far
away
and
rei
grew
calm
when
he
heard
no
longer
the
wild
song
and
the
clashing
of
the
timbrels
i
must
tell
thee
eperitus
he
said
how
the
matter
ended
between
the
divine
prince
and
meriamun
she
bowed
her
pride
before
her
father
and
her
brother
her
father
s
will
was
hers
she
seemed
to
let
her
secret
sleep
and
she
set
her
own
price
on
her
hand
in
everything
she
must
be
the
equal
of
pharaoh
that
was
her
price
and
in
all
the
temples
and
all
the
cities
she
was
to
be
solemnly
proclaimed
joint
heir
with
him
of
the
upper
and
lower
land
the
bargain
was
struck
and
the
price
was
paid
after
that
night
over
the
game
of
pieces
meriamun
was
changed
thenceforth
she
did
not
mock
at
the
prince
she
made
herself
gentle
and
submissive
to
his
will
so
the
time
drew
on
till
at
length
in
the
beginning
of
the
rising
of
the
waters
came
the
day
of
her
bridal
with
a
mighty
pomp
was
pharaoh
s
daughter
wedded
to
pharaoh
s
son
but
her
hand
was
cold
as
she
stood
at
the
altar
cold
as
the
hand
of
one
who
sleeps
in
osiris
proudly
and
coldly
she
sat
in
the
golden
chariot
passing
in
and
out
the
great
gates
of
tanis
only
when
she
listened
and
heard
the
acclaiming
thousands
cry
so
loudly
that
the
cry
of
was
lost
in
the
echoes
of
her
name
then
only
did
she
smile
cold
too
she
sat
in
her
white
robes
at
the
feast
that
pharaoh
made
and
she
never
looked
at
the
husband
by
her
side
though
he
looked
kindly
on
her
the
feast
was
long
but
it
ended
at
last
and
then
came
the
music
and
the
singers
but
meriamun
making
excuse
rose
and
went
out
attended
by
her
ladies
and
i
also
weary
and
sad
at
heart
passed
thence
to
my
own
chamber
and
busied
myself
with
the
instruments
of
my
art
for
stranger
i
build
the
houses
of
gods
and
kings
presently
as
i
sat
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
a
woman
entered
wrapped
in
a
heavy
cloak
she
put
aside
the
cloak
and
before
me
was
meriamun
in
all
her
bridal
robes
heed
me
not
rei
she
said
i
am
yet
free
for
an
hour
and
i
would
watch
thee
at
thy
labour
nay
it
is
my
humour
gainsay
me
not
for
i
love
well
to
look
on
that
wrinkled
face
of
thine
scored
by
the
cunning
chisel
of
thy
knowledge
and
thy
years
so
from
a
child
have
i
watched
thee
tracing
the
shapes
of
mighty
temples
that
shall
endure
when
ourselves
and
perchance
the
very
gods
we
worship
have
long
since
ceased
to
be
ah
rei
thou
wise
man
thine
is
the
better
part
for
thou
buildest
in
cold
enduring
stone
and
attirest
thy
walls
as
thy
fancy
bids
thee
but
i
i
build
in
the
dust
of
human
hearts
and
my
will
is
written
in
their
dust
when
i
am
dead
raise
me
a
tomb
more
beautiful
than
ever
has
been
known
and
write
upon
the
portal
in
the
last
temple
of
her
pride
dwells
that
tired
builder
meriamun
the
thus
she
talked
wildly
in
words
with
little
reason
nay
speak
not
so
i
said
for
is
it
not
thy
bridal
night
what
dost
thou
here
at
such
a
time
what
do
i
here
surely
i
come
to
be
a
child
again
see
rei
in
all
wide
khem
there
is
no
woman
so
shamed
so
lost
so
utterly
undone
as
is
the
royal
meriamun
whom
thou
lovest
i
am
lower
than
she
who
plies
the
street
for
bread
for
the
loftier
the
spirit
the
greater
is
the
fall
i
am
sold
into
shame
and
power
is
my
price
oh
cursed
be
the
fate
of
woman
who
only
by
her
beauty
can
be
great
oh
cursed
be
that
ancient
counsellor
thou
wottest
of
and
cursed
be
i
who
wakened
that
which
slept
and
warmed
that
which
was
in
my
breath
and
in
my
breast
and
cursed
be
this
sin
to
which
he
led
me
spurn
me
rei
strike
me
on
the
cheek
spit
upon
me
on
meriamun
the
royal
harlot
who
sells
herself
to
win
a
crown
oh
i
hate
him
hate
him
and
i
will
pay
him
in
shame
for
shame
him
the
clown
in
king
s
attire
see
here
and
from
her
robe
she
drew
a
white
flower
that
was
known
to
her
and
me
twice
have
i
been
minded
with
this
deadly
blossom
to
make
an
end
of
me
and
of
all
my
shame
and
all
my
empty
greed
of
glory
but
this
thought
has
held
my
hand
i
meriamun
will
live
to
look
across
his
grave
and
break
his
images
and
beat
out
the
writings
of
his
name
from
every
temple
wall
in
khem
as
they
beat
out
the
hated
name
of
hatshepu
i
and
suddenly
she
burst
into
a
rain
of
tears
she
who
was
not
wont
to
weep
nay
touch
me
not
she
said
they
were
but
tears
of
anger
meriamun
is
mistress
of
her
fate
not
fate
of
meriamun
and
now
my
lord
awaits
me
and
i
must
be
gone
kiss
me
on
the
brow
old
friend
whilst
yet
i
am
the
meriamun
thou
knewest
and
then
kiss
me
no
more
for
ever
at
the
least
this
is
well
for
thee
for
when
meriamun
is
queen
of
khem
thou
shalt
be
first
in
all
the
land
and
stand
on
the
footsteps
of
my
throne
and
she
gathered
up
her
raiment
and
cast
her
white
flower
of
death
in
the
flame
of
the
brazier
and
was
gone
leaving
me
yet
sadder
at
heart
for
now
i
knew
that
she
was
not
as
other
women
are
but
greater
for
good
or
evil
on
the
morrow
night
i
sat
again
at
my
task
and
again
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
again
a
woman
entered
and
threw
aside
her
wrappings
it
was
meriamun
she
was
pale
and
stern
and
as
i
rose
she
waved
me
back
has
then
the
prince
thy
husband
i
stammered
speak
not
to
me
of
the
prince
rei
my
servant
she
made
answer
yesterday
i
spoke
to
thee
wildly
my
mind
was
overwrought
let
it
be
forgotten
a
wife
am
i
a
happy
wife
and
she
smiled
so
strangely
that
i
shrunk
back
from
her
now
to
my
errand
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
a
troublous
dream
and
thou
art
wise
and
instructed
therefore
i
pray
thee
interpret
my
vision
i
slept
and
dreamed
of
a
man
and
in
my
dream
i
loved
him
more
than
i
can
tell
for
my
heart
beat
to
his
heart
and
in
the
light
of
him
i
lived
and
all
my
soul
was
his
and
i
knew
that
i
loved
him
for
ever
and
pharaoh
was
my
husband
but
in
my
dream
i
loved
him
not
now
there
came
a
woman
rising
out
of
the
sea
more
beautiful
than
i
with
a
beauty
fairer
and
more
changeful
than
the
dawn
upon
the
mountains
and
she
too
loved
this
godlike
man
and
he
loved
her
then
we
strove
together
for
his
love
matching
beauty
against
beauty
and
wit
against
wit
and
magic
against
magic
now
one
conquered
and
now
the
other
but
in
the
end
the
victory
was
mine
and
i
went
arrayed
as
for
a
and
i
clasped
a
corpse
i
woke
and
again
i
slept
and
saw
myself
wearing
another
garb
and
speaking
another
tongue
before
me
was
the
man
i
loved
and
there
too
was
the
woman
wrapped
about
with
beauty
and
i
was
changed
and
yet
i
was
the
very
meriamun
thou
seest
and
once
more
we
struggled
for
the
mastery
and
for
this
man
s
love
and
in
that
day
she
conquered
me
i
slept
and
again
i
woke
and
in
another
land
than
khem
a
strange
land
and
yet
methought
i
knew
it
from
long
ago
there
i
dwelt
among
the
graves
and
dark
faces
were
about
me
and
i
wore
that
thou
knowest
for
a
girdle
and
the
tombs
of
the
rock
wherein
we
dwelt
were
scored
with
the
writings
of
a
dead
tongue
the
tongue
of
that
land
whence
our
fathers
came
we
were
all
changed
yet
the
same
and
once
more
the
woman
and
i
struggled
for
the
mastery
and
though
i
seemed
to
conquer
yet
a
sea
of
fire
came
over
me
and
i
woke
and
i
slept
again
then
confusion
was
piled
upon
confusion
nor
can
my
memory
hold
all
that
came
to
pass
for
this
game
played
itself
afresh
in
lands
and
lives
and
tongues
without
number
only
the
last
bout
and
the
winner
were
not
revealed
to
me
and
in
my
dream
i
cried
aloud
to
the
protecting
gods
to
escape
out
of
the
dream
and
i
sought
for
light
that
i
might
see
whence
these
things
were
then
as
in
a
vision
the
past
opened
up
its
gates
it
seemed
that
upon
a
time
thousand
thousand
ages
agone
i
and
this
man
of
my
dream
had
arisen
from
nothingness
and
looked
in
each
other
s
eyes
and
loved
with
a
love
unspeakable
and
vowed
a
vow
that
shall
endure
from
time
to
time
and
world
to
world
for
we
were
not
mortal
then
but
partook
of
the
nature
of
the
gods
being
more
fair
and
great
than
any
of
human
kind
and
our
happiness
was
the
happiness
of
heaven
but
in
our
great
joy
we
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
the
that
thou
knowest
of
that
thing
rei
with
which
against
thy
counsel
i
have
but
lately
dealt
the
kiss
of
our
love
awakened
that
which
slept
the
fire
of
our
love
warmed
that
which
was
we
defied
the
holy
gods
worshipping
them
not
but
rather
each
the
other
for
we
knew
that
as
the
gods
we
were
eternal
and
the
gods
were
angered
against
us
and
drew
us
up
into
their
presence
and
while
we
trembled
they
spake
as
with
a
voice
ye
twain
who
are
one
life
each
completing
each
because
with
your
kisses
ye
have
wakened
that
which
slept
and
with
the
fire
of
your
love
have
warmed
that
which
was
because
ye
have
forgotten
them
that
gave
you
life
and
love
and
joy
hearken
to
your
doom
from
two
be
ye
made
and
through
all
time
strive
ye
to
be
twain
again
pass
from
this
holy
place
down
to
the
hell
of
earth
and
though
ye
be
immortal
put
on
the
garments
of
mortality
pass
on
from
life
to
life
live
and
love
and
hate
and
seem
to
die
have
acquaintance
with
every
lot
and
in
your
blind
forgetfulness
being
one
and
being
equal
work
each
other
s
woe
according
to
the
law
of
earth
and
for
your
love
s
sake
sin
and
be
shamed
perish
and
appear
to
conquer
and
be
conquered
pursuing
your
threefold
destiny
and
at
the
word
of
fate
the
unaltering
circle
meets
and
the
veil
of
blindness
falls
from
your
eyes
and
as
a
scroll
your
folly
is
unrolled
and
the
hid
purpose
of
your
sorrow
is
accomplished
and
once
more
ye
are
twain
and
then
as
we
trembled
clinging
each
to
each
again
the
great
voice
spoke
ye
twain
who
are
one
let
that
to
which
ye
have
hearkened
divide
you
and
enfold
you
be
ye
three
and
as
the
voice
spoke
i
was
torn
with
agony
and
strength
went
out
of
me
and
there
by
him
i
loved
stood
the
woman
of
my
dream
crowned
with
every
glory
and
adorned
with
the
star
and
we
were
three
and
between
him
and
me
yet
enfolding
him
and
me
writhed
that
thing
thou
wottest
of
and
he
whom
i
loved
turned
to
look
upon
the
fair
woman
wondering
and
she
smiled
and
stretched
out
her
arm
towards
him
as
one
who
would
take
that
which
is
her
own
and
rei
in
that
hour
though
it
was
but
in
a
dream
i
knew
the
mortal
pain
of
jealousy
and
awoke
trembling
and
now
read
thou
this
vision
rei
thou
who
art
learned
in
the
interpretation
of
dreams
and
in
the
ways
of
oh
lady
i
made
answer
this
thing
is
too
high
for
me
i
can
not
interpret
it
but
where
thou
art
there
may
i
be
to
help
i
know
thy
love
she
said
but
in
thy
words
is
little
light
so
so
let
it
pass
it
was
but
a
dream
and
if
indeed
it
came
from
the
under
world
why
it
was
from
no
helpful
god
but
rather
from
set
the
tormentor
or
from
pasht
the
terrible
who
throws
the
creeping
shadow
of
her
doom
upon
the
mirror
of
my
sleep
for
that
which
is
decreed
will
surely
come
to
pass
i
am
blown
like
the
dust
by
the
breath
of
fate
now
to
rest
upon
the
temple
s
loftiest
tops
now
to
be
trodden
underfoot
of
slaves
and
now
to
be
swallowed
by
the
bitter
deep
and
in
season
thence
rolled
forth
again
i
love
not
this
lord
of
mine
who
shall
be
pharaoh
and
never
may
come
whom
i
shall
love
tis
well
that
i
love
him
not
for
to
love
is
to
be
a
slave
when
the
heart
is
cold
then
the
hand
is
strong
and
i
am
fain
to
be
the
queen
leading
pharaoh
by
the
beard
the
first
of
all
the
ancient
land
of
khem
for
i
was
not
born
to
serve
nay
while
i
may
i
rule
awaiting
the
end
of
rule
look
forth
rei
and
see
how
the
rays
from
mother
isis
throne
flood
all
the
courts
and
all
the
city
s
streets
and
break
in
light
upon
the
water
s
breast
so
shall
the
s
flame
flood
all
this
land
of
khem
what
matters
it
if
ere
the
morn
isis
must
pass
to
her
dominion
of
the
dead
and
the
voice
of
meriamun
be
hushed
within
a
sepulchre
so
she
spoke
and
went
thence
and
on
her
face
was
no
bride
s
smile
but
rather
such
a
gaze
as
that
with
which
the
great
sphinx
horemku
looks
out
across
the
desert
a
strange
queen
rei
said
the
wanderer
as
he
paused
but
what
have
i
to
make
in
this
tale
of
a
bride
and
her
mad
dreams
more
than
thou
shalt
desire
said
rei
but
let
us
come
to
the
end
and
thou
shalt
hear
thy
part
in
the
viii
the
ka
the
bai
and
the
khou
the
divine
pharaoh
rameses
died
and
was
gathered
to
osiris
with
these
hands
i
closed
his
coffin
and
set
him
in
his
splendid
tomb
where
he
shall
rest
unharmed
for
ever
till
the
day
of
the
awakening
and
meriamun
and
meneptah
reigned
in
khem
but
to
pharaoh
she
was
very
cold
though
he
did
her
will
in
everything
and
they
had
but
one
child
so
that
in
a
while
he
wearied
of
her
loveliness
but
hers
was
the
and
she
ruled
pharaoh
as
she
ruled
all
else
for
me
my
lot
was
bettered
she
talked
much
with
me
and
advanced
me
to
great
dignity
so
that
i
was
the
first
master
builder
in
khem
and
commander
of
the
legion
of
amen
now
it
chanced
that
meriamun
made
a
feast
where
she
entertained
pharaoh
and
hataska
sat
beside
him
she
was
the
first
lady
about
the
queen
s
person
a
beautiful
but
insolent
woman
who
had
gained
pharaoh
s
favour
for
the
hour
now
wine
worked
so
with
the
king
that
he
toyed
openly
with
the
lady
hataska
s
hand
but
meriamun
the
queen
took
no
note
though
hataska
who
had
also
drunk
of
the
warm
wine
of
the
lower
land
grew
insolent
as
was
her
wont
she
quaffed
deep
from
her
cup
of
gold
and
bade
a
slave
bear
it
to
the
queen
crying
pledge
me
my
the
meaning
of
her
message
was
plain
to
all
who
heard
this
waiting
lady
openly
declared
herself
wife
to
pharaoh
and
an
equal
of
the
queen
now
meriamun
cared
nothing
for
pharaoh
s
love
but
for
power
she
did
care
and
she
frowned
while
a
light
shone
in
her
dark
eyes
yet
she
took
the
cup
and
touched
it
with
her
lips
presently
she
lifted
her
own
cup
in
turn
and
toyed
with
it
then
made
pretence
to
drink
and
said
softly
to
the
king
s
paramour
who
had
pledged
her
pledge
me
in
answer
hataska
my
servant
for
soon
methinks
thou
shalt
be
greater
than
the
now
this
foolish
woman
read
her
saying
wrong
and
took
the
golden
cup
from
the
eunuch
who
bore
it
with
a
little
nod
to
the
queen
and
a
wave
of
her
slim
hand
hataska
drank
and
instantly
with
a
great
cry
she
fell
dead
across
the
board
then
while
all
the
company
sat
in
terror
neither
daring
to
be
silent
nor
to
speak
and
while
meriamun
smiled
scornfully
on
the
dark
head
lying
low
among
the
roses
on
the
board
pharaoh
leaped
up
mad
with
wrath
and
called
to
the
guards
to
seize
the
queen
but
she
waved
them
back
and
speaking
in
a
slow
cold
voice
she
said
dare
not
to
touch
khem
s
anointed
queen
lest
your
fate
be
as
fate
for
thee
meneptah
forget
not
thy
marriage
oath
what
am
i
queen
and
shall
thy
wantons
throw
their
insolence
in
my
teeth
and
name
me
their
sister
not
so
for
if
my
eyes
be
blind
yet
my
ears
are
open
peace
she
is
rightly
served
choose
thou
a
lowlier
mistress
and
pharaoh
made
no
answer
for
he
feared
her
with
an
fear
but
she
sinking
back
in
her
seat
of
state
played
with
the
gold
kepher
on
her
breast
and
watched
them
bear
the
body
forth
to
the
house
of
osiris
one
by
one
all
the
company
made
obeisance
and
passed
thence
glad
to
be
gone
till
at
the
last
there
were
left
only
pharaoh
and
meriamun
the
queen
and
myself
rei
the
priest
for
all
were
much
afraid
then
pharaoh
spoke
looking
neither
at
her
nor
at
me
and
half
in
fear
half
in
anger
thou
hateful
woman
accursed
be
the
day
when
first
i
looked
upon
thy
beauty
thou
hast
conquered
me
but
beware
for
i
am
still
pharaoh
and
thy
lord
cross
my
purpose
once
again
and
by
him
who
sleeps
at
philæ
i
will
discrown
thee
and
give
thy
body
to
the
tormentors
and
set
thy
soul
loose
to
follow
her
whom
thou
hast
then
meriamun
answered
proudly
pharaoh
be
warned
lift
but
one
finger
against
my
majesty
and
thou
art
doomed
thou
canst
not
slay
me
but
i
can
thee
and
i
swear
by
the
same
oath
by
him
who
sleeps
at
philæ
lift
a
hand
against
me
ay
harbour
one
thought
of
treachery
and
thou
diest
not
lightly
can
i
be
deceived
for
i
have
messengers
that
thou
canst
not
hear
something
royal
meneptah
do
i
know
of
the
magic
of
that
queen
taia
who
was
before
me
now
listen
do
this
one
thing
and
all
shall
be
well
go
on
thy
path
and
leave
me
to
follow
mine
queen
i
am
queen
i
will
remain
and
in
all
matters
of
the
state
mine
must
be
an
equal
voice
though
it
is
thine
that
speaks
and
for
the
rest
we
are
apart
henceforth
for
thou
fearest
me
and
meneptah
i
love
not
thee
nor
any
as
thou
hast
spoken
so
be
it
quoth
pharaoh
for
his
heart
sank
and
his
fear
came
back
upon
him
evil
was
the
day
when
first
we
met
and
this
is
the
price
of
my
desire
henceforth
we
are
apart
in
bed
and
board
but
in
the
council
we
are
still
one
for
our
ends
are
one
i
know
thy
power
meriamun
thou
gifted
of
the
evil
gods
thou
needest
not
fear
that
i
shall
seek
to
slay
thee
for
a
spear
cast
against
the
heavens
returns
on
him
who
threw
it

my
servant
thou
art
witness
to
our
oaths
hear
now
their
undoing
meriamun
the
queen
of
ancient
khem
thou
art
no
more
wife
of
mine
and
he
went
heavily
and
stricken
with
fear
nay
she
said
gazing
after
him
no
more
am
i
meneptah
s
wife
but
still
am
i
khem
s
dreaded
queen
oh
thou
old
priest
i
am
aweary
see
what
a
lot
is
mine
who
have
all
things
but
love
and
yet
am
sick
of
all
i
longed
for
power
and
power
is
mine
and
what
is
power
it
is
a
rod
wherewith
we
beat
the
air
that
straightway
closes
on
the
stroke
yes
i
tire
of
my
loveless
days
and
of
this
dull
round
of
common
things
oh
for
one
hour
of
love
and
in
that
hour
to
die
oh
that
the
future
would
lift
its
veil
and
disclose
the
face
of
time
to
be
say
rei
wilt
thou
be
bold
and
dare
a
deed
and
she
clasped
me
by
the
sleeve
and
whispered
in
my
ear
in
the
dead
tongue
known
to
her
and
me
her
i
slew

sawest
ay
queen

saw
what
of
her
twas
ill

rightly
done

well
done
but
thou
knowest
she
is
not
yet
cold
nor
for
a
while
will
be
and
i
have
the
art
to
drag
her
spirit
back
ere
she
be
cold
from
where
she
is
and
to
force
knowledge
from
her
lips
for
being
an
osiris

future
is
open
to
her

this
nay

cried

unholy

disturb
the
dead

guardian
gods

fain
for
knowledge

thus
only
may
i
win
it

the
dread
endeavour

of

in
seeking

answered

shalt
not
go
alone
i
too
have
some
skill
in
magic
and
perchance
can
ward
evil
from
thee
so
if
indeed
thou
wilt
dare
this
dreadful
thing
behold
now
as
ever
i
am
thy
it
is
well
see
now
the
body
will
this
night
be
laid
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
of
osiris
that
is
near
the
great
gates
as
is
the
custom
to
await
the
coming
of
the
embalmers
come
ere
she
be
colder
than
my
heart
come
with
me
rei
to
the
house
of
the
lord
of
the
dead
she
passed
to
her
chamber
wrapped
herself
about
in
a
dark
robe
and
hurried
with
me
to
the
temple
doors
where
we
were
challenged
by
the
guards
who
passes
in
the
name
of
the
holy
osiris
rei
the
master
builder
and
the
anointed
priest
and
with
him
another
i
made
answer
nay
i
open
not
there
is
one
within
who
may
not
be
who
then
is
within
she
whom
the
queen
the
queen
sends
one
who
would
look
on
her
she
then
the
priest
gazed
on
the
hooded
form
beside
me
and
started
back
crying
a
token
noble
i
held
up
the
royal
signet
and
bowing
he
opened
being
come
within
the
temple
i
lit
the
tapers
that
had
been
prepared
then
by
their
feeble
light
we
passed
through
the
outer
hall
till
we
came
to
the
curtains
that
veil
the
sanctuary
of
the
holy
place
and
here
i
quenched
the
tapers
for
no
fire
must
enter
there
save
that
which
burns
upon
the
altar
of
the
dead
but
through
the
curtains
came
rays
of
light
open
said
meriamun
and
i
opened
and
hand
in
hand
we
passed
in
on
the
altar
that
is
in
the
place
the
flame
burnt
brightly
the
chamber
is
not
wide
and
great
for
this
is
the
smallest
of
the
temples
of
tanis
but
yet
so
large
that
the
light
could
not
reach
its
walls
nor
pierce
the
overhanging
gloom
and
by
much
gazing
scarcely
could
we
discover
the
outline
of
the
graven
shapes
of
the
holy
gods
that
are
upon
the
walls
but
the
light
fell
clear
upon
the
great
statue
of
the
osiris
that
was
seated
behind
the
altar
fashioned
in
the
black
stone
of
syene
wound
about
with
the
wearing
on
his
head
the
crown
of
the
upper
land
and
holding
in
his
hands
the
crook
of
divinity
and
the
awful
scourge
of
punishment
the
light
shone
all
about
the
white
and
dreadful
shape
that
was
placed
upon
his
holy
knees
the
naked
shape
of
lost
hataska
who
this
night
had
died
at
the
hand
of
meriamun
there
she
bowed
her
head
against
the
sacred
breast
her
long
hair
streaming
down
on
either
side
her
arms
tied
across
her
heart
and
her
eyes
whence
the
hues
of
life
had
scarcely
faded
widely
staring
at
the
darkness
of
the
shrine
for
at
tanis
to
this
day
it
is
the
custom
for
a
night
to
place
those
of
high
birth
or
office
who
die
suddenly
upon
the
knees
of
the
statue
of
osiris
see
i
said
to
the
queen
speaking
low
for
the
weight
of
the
haunted
place
sank
into
my
heart
see
how
she
who
scarce
an
hour
ago
was
but
a
lovely
wanton
hath
by
thine
act
been
clad
in
majesty
greater
than
all
the
glory
of
the
earth
bethink
thee
wilt
thou
dare
indeed
to
summon
back
the
spirit
to
the
body
whence
thou
hast
set
it
free
not
easily
o
queen
may
it
be
done
for
all
thy
magic
and
if
perchance
she
answereth
thee
it
may
well
be
that
the
terror
of
her
words
shall
utterly
o
erwhelm
nay
she
made
answer
i
am
instructed
i
fear
not
i
know
by
what
name
to
call
the
khou
that
hovers
on
the
threshold
of
the
double
hall
of
truth
and
how
to
send
it
back
to
its
own
place
i
fear
not
but
if
perchance
thou
fearest
rei
depart
hence
and
leave
me
to
the
task
nay
i
said
i
also
am
instructed
and
i
go
not
but
i
say
to
thee
that
this
is
then
meriamun
spoke
no
more
but
lifting
up
her
hands
she
held
them
heavenwards
and
so
for
a
while
she
stood
her
face
fixed
as
was
the
face
of
dead
hataska
then
as
must
be
done
i
drew
the
circle
round
us
and
round
the
altar
and
the
statue
of
osiris
and
that
which
sat
upon
his
knee
with
my
staff
i
drew
it
and
standing
therein
i
said
the
holy
words
which
should
ward
away
the
evil
things
that
come
near
in
such
an
hour
now
meriamun
threw
a
certain
powder
into
the
flame
upon
the
altar
thrice
she
threw
the
powder
and
as
she
threw
it
a
ball
of
flame
rose
from
the
altar
and
floated
away
each
time
that
she
threw
did
the
ball
of
fire
rise
and
this
it
was
needful
to
do
for
by
fire
only
may
the
dead
be
manifest
and
therefore
was
a
globe
of
fire
given
to
each
of
the
three
shapes
that
together
make
the
threefold
spirit
of
the
dead
and
when
the
three
globes
of
fire
had
melted
into
air
passing
over
the
head
of
the
statue
of
osiris
thrice
did
meriamun
cry
aloud
hataska
hataska
by
the
dreadful
name
i
summon
thee
i
summon
thee
from
the
threshold
of
the
double
hall
i
summon
thee
from
the
gates
of
judgment
i
summon
thee
from
the
door
of
doom
by
the
link
of
life
and
death
that
is
between
thee
and
me
i
bid
thee
come
from
where
thou
art
and
make
answer
to
that
which
i
shall
ask
of
she
ceased
but
no
answer
came
still
the
cold
osiris
smiled
and
still
the
body
on
his
knee
sat
with
open
eyes
gazing
into
nothingness
not
thus
easily
i
whispered
may
this
dreadful
thing
be
done
thou
art
instructed
in
the
word
of
fear
if
thou
darest
let
it
pass
thy
lips
or
let
us
be
nay
it
shall
be
spoken
she
said
and
thus
she
wrought
passing
to
the
statue
she
hid
her
head
within
her
cloak
and
with
both
hands
grasped
the
feet
of
the
slain
hataska
seeing
this
i
also
crouched
upon
the
floor
and
hid
my
face
for
it
is
death
to
hear
that
word
with
an
uncovered
face
then
in
so
soft
a
whisper
that
scarce
had
its
breath
stirred
a
feather
on
her
lips
meriamun
spoke
the
word
of
fear
which
may
not
be
written
whose
sound
has
power
to
pass
all
space
and
open
the
ears
of
the
dead
who
dwell
in
amenti
softly
she
said
it
for
in
a
shout
of
thunder
it
was
caught
up
and
echoed
from
her
lips
and
down
the
eternal
halls
it
seemed
to
rush
on
the
feet
of
storm
and
the
wings
of
wind
so
that
the
roof
rocked
and
the
deep
foundations
of
the
temple
quivered
like
a
tree
unveil
ye
mortals
cried
a
dreadful
voice
and
look
upon
the
sight
of
fear
that
ye
have
dared
to
and
i
rose
and
cast
my
cloak
from
about
my
face
and
gazed
then
sank
down
in
terror
for
round
about
the
circle
that
i
had
drawn
pressed
all
the
multitude
of
the
dead
countless
as
the
desert
sands
they
pressed
gazing
with
awful
eyes
upon
us
twain
and
the
fire
that
was
on
the
altar
died
away
but
yet
was
there
light
for
it
shone
from
those
dead
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
lost
hataska
there
was
light
and
ever
the
faces
changed
never
for
one
beat
of
time
did
they
cease
to
change
for
as
we
gazed
upon
a
face
it
would
melt
even
to
the
eyes
and
round
these
same
eyes
again
would
gather
but
no
more
the
same
and
like
the
sloping
sides
of
pyramids
were
the
faces
set
about
us
from
the
ground
to
the
temple
roof
and
on
us
were
fixed
their
glowing
eyes
and
i
rei
being
instructed
knew
that
to
suffer
myself
to
be
overcome
with
terror
was
death
as
it
was
death
to
pass
without
the
circle
so
in
my
heart
i
called
upon
osiris
lord
of
the
dead
to
protect
us
and
even
as
i
named
the
ineffable
name
lo
all
the
thousand
thousand
faces
bent
themselves
in
adoration
and
then
turning
looked
each
upon
the
other
even
as
though
each
spake
to
each
and
changed
and
swiftly
changed
meriamun
i
said
gathering
up
my
strength
fear
not
but
beware
nay
wherefore
should
i
fear
she
answered
because
the
veil
of
sense
is
torn
and
for
an
hour
we
see
those
who
are
ever
about
our
path
and
whose
eyes
watch
our
most
secret
thought
continually
i
fear
and
she
stepped
boldly
even
to
the
edge
of
the
circle
and
cried
all
hail
ye
sahus
spirits
of
the
awful
dead
among
whom
i
also
shall
be
and
as
she
came
the
changing
faces
shrunk
away
leaving
a
space
before
her
and
in
the
space
there
grew
two
arms
mighty
and
black
that
stretched
themselves
towards
her
until
there
was
not
the
length
of
three
grains
of
wheat
betwixt
the
clutching
fingers
and
her
breast
but
meriamun
only
laughed
and
drew
back
a
space
not
so
thou
enemy
she
said
this
circle
thou
may
st
not
break
it
is
too
strong
for
thee
but
to
the
work
hataska
once
again
by
the
link
of
life
and
death
i
summon
thee
and
this
time
thou
must
come
thou
who
wast
a
wanton
and
now
art
greater
than
the
and
as
she
spoke
from
the
dead
form
of
the
woman
on
osiris
knee
there
issued
forth
another
form
and
stood
before
us
as
a
snake
issues
from
its
slough
and
as
was
the
dead
hataska
so
was
this
form
feature
for
feature
look
for
look
and
limb
for
limb
but
still
the
corpse
rested
upon
osiris
knee
for
this
was
but
the
that
stood
before
us
and
thus
spoke
the
voice
of
hataska
in
the
lips
of
the
ka
what
wouldest
thou
with
me
who
am
no
more
of
thy
company
o
thou
by
whose
hand
my
body
did
perish
why
troublest
thou
me
and
meriamun
made
answer
i
would
this
of
thee
that
thou
shouldest
declare
unto
me
the
future
even
in
the
presence
of
this
great
company
speak
i
command
and
the
ka
said
nay
meriamun
that
i
can
not
do
for
i
am
but
the
ka
the
dweller
in
the
tomb
the
guardian
of
what
was
hataska
whom
thou
didst
slay
whom
i
must
watch
through
all
the
days
of
death
till
resurrection
is
of
the
future
i
know
naught
seek
thou
that
which
stand
thou
on
one
side
quoth
the
queen
and
the
dweller
in
the
tomb
obeyed
then
once
more
she
called
upon
hataska
and
there
came
a
sound
of
rushing
wings
and
behold
on
the
head
of
the
statue
of
osiris
sat
a
great
bird
feathered
as
it
were
with
gold
but
the
bird
had
the
head
of
a
woman
and
the
face
was
fashioned
as
the
face
of
hataska
and
thus
it
spoke
that
was
the
what
wouldest
thou
with
me
meriamun
who
am
no
more
of
thy
company
why
dost
thou
draw
me
from
the
under
world
thou
by
whose
hand
my
body
did
perish
and
meriamun
said
this
i
would
of
thee
that
thou
shouldest
declare
unto
me
the
future
speak
i
command
and
the
bai
said
nay
meriamun
that
i
can
not
do
i
am
but
the
bai
of
her
who
was
hataska
and
i
fly
from
death
to
life
and
life
to
death
till
the
hour
of
awakening
is
of
the
future
i
know
naught
seek
thou
that
which
rest
thou
where
thou
art
quoth
the
queen
and
there
it
rested
awful
to
see
then
once
more
meriamun
called
upon
hataska
bidding
her
hear
the
summons
where
she
was
and
behold
the
eyes
of
the
dead
one
that
was
upon
the
knee
of
osiris
glowed
and
glowed
the
eyes
of
the
dweller
in
the
tomb
and
of
the
winged
messenger
who
sat
above
and
then
there
was
a
sound
as
the
sound
of
wind
and
from
above
cleaving
the
darkness
descended
a
tongue
of
flame
and
rested
on
the
brow
of
the
dead
hataska
and
the
eyes
of
all
the
thousand
thousand
spirits
turned
and
gazed
upon
the
tongue
of
flame
and
then
dead
hataska
spoke
though
her
lips
moved
not
yet
she
spoke
and
this
she
said
what
wouldest
thou
with
me
meriamun
who
am
no
more
of
thy
company
why
dost
thou
dare
to
trouble
me
thou
by
whose
hand
my
body
did
perish
drawing
me
from
the
threshold
of
the
double
hall
of
truth
back
to
the
over
world
and
meriamun
the
queen
said
oh
thou
for
this
purpose
have
i
called
thee
i
am
aweary
of
my
days
and
i
fain
would
learn
the
future
the
future
fain
would
i
learn
but
the
forked
tongue
of
that
which
sleeps
tells
me
no
word
and
the
lips
of
that
which
is
are
dumb
tell
me
then
thou
i
charge
thee
by
the
word
that
has
power
to
open
the
lips
of
the
dead
thou
who
in
all
things
art
instructed
what
shall
be
the
burden
of
my
days
and
the
dread
khou
made
answer
love
shall
be
the
burden
of
thy
days
and
death
shall
be
the
burden
of
thy
love
behold
one
draws
near
from
out
the
north
whom
thou
hast
loved
whom
thou
shalt
love
from
life
to
life
till
all
things
are
accomplished
bethink
thee
of
a
dream
that
thou
dreamedst
as
thou
didst
lie
on
pharaoh
s
bed
and
read
its
riddle
meriamun
thou
art
great
and
thy
name
is
known
upon
the
earth
and
in
amenti
is
thy
name
known
high
is
thy
fate
and
through
blood
and
sorrow
shalt
thou
find
it
i
have
spoken
let
me
it
is
well
the
queen
made
answer
but
not
yet
mayest
thou
go
hence
first
i
command
thee
by
the
word
of
dread
and
by
the
link
of
life
and
death
declare
unto
me
if
here
upon
the
earth
and
in
this
life
i
shall
possess
him
whom
i
shall
love
in
sin
and
craft
and
sorrow
meriamun
thou
shalt
possess
him
in
shame
and
jealous
agony
he
shall
be
taken
from
thee
by
one
who
is
stronger
than
thou
though
thou
art
strong
by
one
more
beautiful
than
thou
though
thou
art
beautiful
and
ruin
thou
shalt
give
him
for
his
guerdon
and
ruin
of
the
heart
shalt
thou
harvest
for
thy
portion
but
for
this
time
she
shall
escape
thee
whose
footsteps
march
with
thine
and
with
his
who
shall
be
thine
and
hers
nevertheless
in
a
day
to
come
thou
shalt
pay
her
back
measure
for
measure
and
evil
for
evil
i
have
spoken
let
me
not
yet
o
khou
not
yet
i
have
still
to
learn
show
me
the
face
of
her
who
is
mine
enemy
and
the
face
of
him
who
is
my
thrice
mayest
thou
speak
to
me
o
thou
greatly
daring
answered
the
dread
khou
and
thrice
i
may
make
reply
and
then
farewell
till
i
meet
thee
on
the
threshold
of
the
hall
whence
thou
hast
drawn
me
look
now
on
the
face
of
that
hataska
whom
thou
and
we
looked
and
behold
the
face
of
dead
hataska
changed
and
changed
the
face
of
the
double
the
that
stood
on
one
side
and
the
face
of
the
great
bird
the
that
spread
his
wings
about
the
head
of
osiris
and
they
grew
beautiful
yes
most
exceeding
beautiful
so
that
it
can
not
be
told
and
the
beauty
was
that
of
a
woman
asleep
then
lo
there
hung
above
hataska
as
it
were
the
shadow
of
one
who
was
watching
her
sleeping
and
his
face
we
saw
not
o
thou
wanderer
it
was
hidden
by
the
visor
of
a
golden
helm
and
in
that
helm
stood
fast
bronze
point
of
a
broken
but
he
was
clad
in
the
armour
of
the
people
of
the
northern
sea
the
aquaiusha
and
his
hair
fell
dark
about
his
shoulders
like
the
petals
of
the
hyacinth
flower
behold
thine
enemy
and
behold
thy
love
farewell
said
the
dread
khou
speaking
through
dead
hataska
s
lips
and
as
the
words
died
the
beauty
faded
and
the
tongue
of
flame
shot
upwards
and
was
lost
and
once
more
the
eyes
of
the
thousand
thousand
dead
turned
and
looked
upon
each
other
even
as
though
their
lips
whispered
each
to
each
but
for
a
while
meriamun
stood
silent
as
one
amazed
then
awaking
she
waved
her
hand
and
cried
begone
thou
begone
thou
and
the
great
bird
whereof
the
face
was
as
the
face
of
hataska
spread
his
golden
wings
and
passed
away
to
his
own
place
and
the
ka
that
was
in
the
semblance
of
hataska
drew
near
to
the
dead
one
s
knees
and
passed
back
into
her
from
whom
she
came
and
all
the
thousand
thousand
faces
melted
though
the
fiery
eyes
still
gazed
upon
us
then
meriamun
covered
her
head
and
once
more
spoke
the
awful
word
and
i
also
covered
up
my
head
but
as
must
be
done
this
second
time
she
called
the
word
aloud
and
yet
though
she
called
it
loud
it
came
but
as
a
tiny
whisper
from
her
lips
nevertheless
at
the
sound
of
it
once
more
was
the
temple
shaken
as
by
a
storm
then
meriamun
unveiled
and
behold
again
the
fire
burned
upon
the
altar
and
on
the
knees
of
the
osiris
sat
hataska
cold
and
still
in
death
and
round
them
was
emptiness
and
silence
now
that
all
is
done
i
greatly
fear
for
that
which
has
been
and
that
which
shall
be
lead
me
hence
o
rei
son
of
pames
for
i
can
no
and
so
with
a
heavy
heart
i
led
her
forth
who
of
all
sorceresses
is
the
very
greatest
behold
thou
wanderer
wherefore
the
queen
was
troubled
at
the
coming
of
the
man
in
the
armour
of
the
north
in
whose
golden
helm
stands
fast
the
point
of
a
broken
book
ii
i
the
prophets
of
the
apura
these
things
are
not
without
the
gods
said
the
wanderer
who
was
called
eperitus
when
he
had
heard
all
the
tale
of
rei
the
priest
son
of
pames
the
head
architect
the
commander
of
the
legion
of
amen
then
he
sat
silent
for
a
while
and
at
last
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
upon
the
old
man
thou
hast
told
a
strange
tale
rei
over
many
a
sea
have
i
wandered
and
in
many
a
land
i
have
sojourned
i
have
seen
the
ways
of
many
peoples
and
have
heard
the
voices
of
the
immortal
gods
dreams
have
come
to
me
and
marvels
have
compassed
me
about
it
has
been
laid
upon
me
to
go
down
into
hades
that
land
which
thou
namest
amenti
and
to
look
on
the
tribes
of
the
dead
but
never
till
now
have
i
known
so
strange
a
thing
for
mark
thou
when
first
i
beheld
this
fair
queen
of
thine
i
thought
she
looked
upon
me
strangely
as
one
who
knew
my
face
and
now
rei
if
thou
speakest
truth
deems
that
she
has
met
me
in
the
ways
of
night
and
magic
say
then
who
was
the
man
of
the
vision
of
the
queen
the
man
with
dark
and
curling
locks
clad
in
golden
armour
after
the
fashion
of
the
achæans
whom
ye
name
the
aquaiusha
wearing
on
his
head
a
golden
helm
wherein
was
fixed
a
broken
spear
before
me
sits
such
a
man
said
rei
or
perchance
it
is
a
god
that
my
eyes
no
god
am
i
quoth
the
wanderer
smiling
though
the
sidonians
deemed
me
nothing
less
when
the
black
bow
twanged
and
the
swift
shafts
flew
read
me
the
riddle
thou
that
art
now
the
aged
priest
looked
upon
the
ground
then
turned
his
eyes
upward
and
with
muttering
lips
prayed
to
thoth
the
god
of
wisdom
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
prayer
he
spoke
art
the
man
he
said
out
of
the
sea
thou
hast
come
to
bring
the
doom
of
love
on
the
lady
meriamun
and
on
thyself
the
doom
of
death
this
i
knew
but
of
the
rest
i
know
nothing
now
i
pray
thee
oh
thou
who
comest
in
the
armour
of
the
north
thou
whose
face
is
clothed
in
beauty
and
who
art
of
all
men
the
mightiest
and
hast
of
all
men
the
sweetest
and
most
guileful
tongue
go
back
go
back
into
the
sea
whence
thou
camest
and
the
lands
whence
thou
hast
not
thus
easily
may
men
escape
their
doom
quoth
the
wanderer
my
death
may
come
as
come
it
must
but
know
this
rei
i
do
not
seek
the
love
of
then
it
well
may
chance
that
thou
shalt
find
it
for
ever
those
who
seek
love
lose
and
those
who
seek
not
i
am
come
to
seek
another
love
said
the
wanderer
and
i
seek
her
till
i
then
i
pray
the
gods
that
thou
mayest
find
her
and
that
khem
may
thus
be
saved
from
sorrow
but
here
in
egypt
there
is
no
woman
so
fair
as
meriamun
and
thou
must
seek
farther
as
quickly
as
may
be
and
now
eperitus
behold
i
must
away
to
do
service
in
the
temple
of
the
holy
amen
for
i
am
his
high
priest
but
i
am
commanded
by
pharaoh
first
to
bring
thee
to
the
feast
at
the
then
he
led
the
wanderer
from
his
chamber
and
brought
him
by
a
side
entrance
to
the
great
palace
of
the
pharaoh
at
tanis
near
the
temple
of
ptah
and
first
he
took
him
to
a
chamber
that
had
been
made
ready
for
him
in
the
palace
a
beautiful
chamber
richly
painted
with
gods
and
furnished
with
ivory
chairs
and
couches
of
ebony
and
silver
and
with
a
gilded
bed
then
the
wanderer
went
into
the
shining
baths
and
girls
bathed
him
and
anointed
him
with
fragrant
oil
and
crowned
him
with
lotus
flowers
when
they
had
bathed
him
they
bade
him
lay
aside
his
golden
armour
and
his
bow
and
the
quiver
full
of
arrows
but
this
the
wanderer
would
not
do
for
as
he
laid
the
black
bow
down
it
thrilled
with
a
thin
sound
of
war
so
rei
led
him
armed
as
he
was
to
a
certain
antechamber
and
there
he
left
him
saying
that
he
would
return
again
when
the
feast
was
done
trumpets
blared
as
the
wanderer
waited
drums
rolled
and
through
the
wide
thrown
curtains
swept
the
lovely
meriamun
and
the
divine
pharaoh
meneptah
with
many
lords
and
ladies
of
the
court
all
crowned
with
roses
and
with
lotus
blooms
the
queen
was
decked
in
royal
attire
her
shining
limbs
were
veiled
in
broidered
silk
about
her
shoulders
was
a
purple
robe
and
round
her
neck
and
arms
were
rings
of
gold
she
was
stately
and
splendid
to
see
with
pale
brows
and
beautiful
disdainful
eyes
where
dreams
seemed
to
sleep
beneath
the
shadow
of
her
eyelashes
on
she
swept
in
all
her
state
and
pride
of
beauty
and
behind
her
came
the
pharaoh
he
was
a
tall
man
but
and
and
to
the
wanderer
it
seemed
that
he
was
too
and
that
care
and
terror
of
evil
to
come
were
always
in
his
mind
meriamun
looked
up
swiftly
greeting
stranger
she
said
thou
comest
in
warlike
guise
to
grace
our
methought
royal
lady
he
made
answer
that
anon
when
i
would
have
laid
it
by
this
bow
of
mine
sang
to
me
of
present
war
therefore
i
am
come
armed
even
to
thy
has
thy
bow
such
foresight
eperitus
said
the
queen
i
have
heard
but
once
of
such
a
weapon
and
that
in
a
minstrel
s
tale
he
came
to
our
court
with
his
lyre
from
the
northern
sea
and
he
sang
of
the
bow
of
minstrel
or
not
thou
does
well
to
come
armed
wanderer
said
the
pharaoh
for
if
thy
bow
sings
my
own
heart
mutters
much
to
me
of
war
to
follow
me
wanderer
however
it
fall
out
said
the
queen
so
he
followed
her
and
the
pharaoh
till
they
came
to
a
splendid
hall
carven
round
with
images
of
fighting
and
feasting
here
on
the
painted
walls
rameses
miamun
drove
the
thousands
of
the
khita
before
his
single
valour
here
men
hunted
through
the
marshes
with
a
great
cat
for
their
hound
never
had
the
wanderer
beheld
such
a
hall
since
he
supped
with
the
sea
king
of
the
fairy
isle
on
the
daïs
raised
above
the
rest
sat
the
pharaoh
and
by
him
sat
meriamun
the
queen
and
by
the
queen
sat
the
wanderer
in
the
golden
armour
of
paris
and
he
leaned
the
black
bow
against
his
ivory
chair
now
the
feast
went
on
and
men
ate
and
drank
the
queen
spoke
little
but
she
watched
the
wanderer
beneath
the
lids
of
her
eyes
suddenly
as
they
feasted
and
grew
merry
the
doors
at
the
end
of
the
chamber
were
thrown
wide
the
guards
fell
back
in
fear
and
behold
at
the
end
of
the
hall
stood
two
men
their
faces
were
tawny
dry
wasted
with
desert
wandering
their
noses
were
hooked
like
eagles
beaks
and
their
eyes
were
yellow
as
the
eyes
of
lions
they
were
clad
in
rough
skins
of
beasts
girdled
about
their
waists
with
leathern
thongs
and
fiercely
they
lifted
their
naked
arms
and
waved
their
wands
of
cedar
both
men
were
old
one
was
the
other
was
shaven
smooth
like
the
priests
of
egypt
as
they
lifted
the
rods
on
high
the
guards
shrank
like
beaten
hounds
and
all
the
guests
hid
their
faces
save
meriamun
and
the
wanderer
alone
even
pharaoh
dared
not
look
on
them
but
he
murmured
angrily
in
his
beard
by
the
name
of
osiris
he
said
here
be
those
soothsayers
of
the
apura
once
again
now
death
waits
on
those
who
let
them
pass
the
then
one
of
the
two
men
he
who
was
shaven
like
a
priest
cried
with
a
great
voice
pharaoh
pharaoh
hearken
to
the
word
of
jahveh
wilt
thou
let
the
people
go
i
will
not
let
them
go
he
answered
pharaoh
pharaoh
hearken
to
the
word
of
jahveh
if
thou
wilt
not
let
the
people
go
then
shall
all
the
firstborn
of
khem
of
the
prince
and
the
slave
of
the
ox
and
the
ass
be
smitten
of
jahveh
wilt
thou
let
the
people
go
now
pharaoh
hearkened
and
those
who
were
at
the
feast
rose
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
o
pharaoh
let
the
people
go
great
woes
are
fallen
upon
khem
because
of
the
apura
o
pharaoh
let
the
people
go
now
pharaoh
s
heart
was
softened
and
he
was
minded
to
let
them
go
but
meriamun
turned
to
him
and
said
thou
shalt
not
let
the
people
go
it
is
not
these
slaves
nor
the
god
of
these
slaves
who
bring
the
plagues
on
khem
but
it
is
that
strange
goddess
the
false
hathor
who
dwells
here
in
the
city
of
tanis
be
not
so
fearful
ever
hadst
thou
a
coward
heart
drive
the
false
hathor
thence
if
thou
wilt
but
hold
these
slaves
to
their
bondage
i
still
have
cities
that
must
be
built
and
yon
slaves
shall
build
then
the
pharaoh
cried
hence
i
bid
you
hence
and
shall
your
people
be
laden
with
a
double
burden
and
their
backs
shall
be
red
with
stripes
i
will
not
let
the
people
go
then
the
two
men
cried
aloud
and
pointing
upward
with
their
staffs
they
vanished
from
the
hall
and
none
dared
to
lay
hands
on
them
but
those
who
sat
at
the
feast
murmured
much
now
the
wanderer
marvelled
why
pharaoh
did
not
command
the
guards
to
cut
down
these
unbidden
guests
who
spoiled
his
festival
the
queen
meriamun
saw
the
wonder
in
his
eyes
and
turned
to
him
know
thou
eperitus
she
said
that
great
plagues
have
come
of
late
on
this
land
of
ours
plagues
of
lice
and
frogs
and
flies
and
darkness
and
the
changing
of
pure
waters
to
blood
and
these
things
our
lord
the
pharaoh
deems
have
been
brought
upon
us
by
the
curse
of
yonder
magicians
conjurers
and
priests
among
certain
slaves
who
work
in
the
land
at
the
building
of
our
cities
but
i
know
well
that
the
curses
come
on
us
from
hathor
the
lady
of
love
because
of
that
woman
who
hath
set
herself
up
here
in
tanis
and
is
worshipped
as
the
why
then
o
queen
said
the
wanderer
is
this
false
goddess
suffered
to
abide
in
your
fair
city
for
as
i
know
well
the
immortal
gods
are
ever
angered
with
those
who
turn
from
their
worship
to
bow
before
strange
why
is
she
suffered
nay
ask
of
pharaoh
my
lord
methinks
it
is
because
her
beauty
is
more
than
the
beauty
of
women
so
the
men
say
who
have
looked
on
it
but
i
have
not
seen
it
for
only
those
men
see
it
who
go
to
worship
at
her
shrine
and
then
from
afar
it
is
not
meet
that
the
queen
of
all
the
lands
should
worship
at
the
shrine
of
a
strange
woman
come
like
thyself
eperitus
from
none
knows
where
if
indeed
she
be
a
woman
and
not
a
fiend
from
the
under
world
but
if
thou
wouldest
learn
more
ask
my
lord
the
pharaoh
for
he
knows
the
shrine
of
the
false
hathor
and
he
knows
who
guard
it
and
what
is
it
that
bars
the
now
the
wanderer
turned
to
pharaoh
saying
o
pharaoh
may
i
know
the
truth
of
this
mystery
then
meneptah
looked
up
and
there
was
doubt
and
trouble
on
his
heavy
face
i
will
tell
thee
readily
thou
wanderer
for
perchance
such
a
man
as
thou
who
hast
travelled
in
many
lands
and
seen
the
faces
of
many
gods
may
understand
the
tale
and
may
help
me
in
the
days
of
my
father
the
holy
rameses
miamun
the
keepers
of
the
temple
of
the
divine
hathor
awoke
and
lo
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
was
a
woman
in
the
garb
of
the
aquaiusha
who
was
beauty
s
self
but
when
they
looked
upon
her
none
could
tell
the
semblance
of
her
beauty
for
to
one
she
seemed
dark
and
to
the
other
fair
and
to
each
man
of
them
she
showed
a
diverse
loveliness
she
smiled
upon
them
and
sang
most
sweetly
and
love
entered
their
hearts
so
that
it
seemed
to
each
man
that
she
only
was
his
heart
s
desire
but
when
any
man
would
have
come
nearer
and
embraced
her
there
was
that
about
her
which
drove
him
back
and
if
he
strove
again
behold
he
fell
down
dead
so
at
last
they
subdued
their
hearts
and
desired
her
no
more
but
worshipped
her
as
the
hathor
come
to
earth
and
made
offerings
of
food
and
drink
to
her
and
prayers
so
three
years
passed
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
the
keepers
of
the
temple
looked
and
the
hathor
was
gone
nothing
remained
of
her
but
a
memory
yet
there
were
some
who
said
that
this
memory
was
dearer
than
all
else
that
the
world
has
to
give
twenty
more
seasons
went
by
and
i
sat
upon
the
throne
of
my
father
and
was
lord
of
the
double
crown
and
on
a
day
a
messenger
came
running
and
cried
now
is
hathor
come
back
to
khem
now
is
hathor
come
back
to
khem
and
as
of
old
none
may
draw
near
her
beauty
then
i
went
to
see
and
lo
before
the
temple
of
hathor
a
great
multitude
was
gathered
and
there
on
the
pylon
brow
stood
the
hathor
s
self
shining
with
changeful
beauty
like
the
dawn
and
as
of
old
she
sang
sweet
songs
and
to
each
man
who
heard
her
voice
was
the
voice
of
his
own
beloved
living
and
lost
to
him
or
dead
and
lost
now
every
man
has
such
a
grave
in
his
heart
as
that
whence
hathor
seems
to
rise
in
changeful
beauty
month
by
month
she
sings
thus
one
day
in
every
month
and
many
a
man
has
sought
to
win
her
and
her
favour
but
in
the
doorways
are
they
who
meet
him
and
press
him
back
and
if
he
still
struggles
on
there
comes
a
clang
of
swords
and
he
falls
dead
but
no
wound
is
found
on
him
and
wanderer
this
is
truth
for
i
myself
have
striven
and
have
been
pressed
back
by
that
which
guards
her
but
i
alone
of
men
who
have
looked
on
her
and
heard
her
strove
not
a
second
time
and
so
saved
myself
thou
alone
of
men
lovest
life
more
than
the
world
s
desire
said
the
queen
thou
hast
ever
sickened
for
the
love
of
this
strange
witch
but
thy
life
thou
lovest
even
better
than
her
beauty
and
thou
dost
not
dare
attempt
again
the
adventure
of
her
embrace
know
eperitus
that
this
sorrow
is
come
upon
the
land
that
all
men
love
yonder
witch
and
rave
of
her
and
to
each
she
wears
a
different
face
and
sings
in
another
voice
when
she
stands
upon
the
pylon
tower
then
thou
wilt
see
the
madness
with
which
she
has
smitten
them
for
they
will
weep
and
pray
and
tear
their
hair
then
they
will
rush
through
the
temple
courts
and
up
to
the
temple
doors
and
be
thrust
back
again
by
that
which
guards
her
but
some
will
yet
strive
madly
on
and
thou
wilt
hear
the
clash
of
arms
and
they
will
fall
dead
before
thee
accursed
is
the
land
i
tell
thee
wanderer
because
of
that
phantom
it
is
accursed
for
it
is
she
who
brings
these
woes
on
khem
from
her
not
from
our
slaves
and
their
mad
conjurers
come
plagues
i
say
and
all
evil
things
and
till
a
man
be
found
who
may
pass
her
guard
and
come
face
to
face
with
the
witch
and
slay
her
plagues
and
woes
and
evil
things
shall
be
the
daily
bread
of
khem
perchance
wanderer
thou
art
such
a
man
and
she
looked
on
him
strangely
yet
if
so
this
is
my
counsel
that
thou
go
not
up
against
her
lest
thou
also
be
bewitched
and
a
great
man
be
lost
to
now
the
wanderer
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
heart
and
made
answer
perchance
lady
my
strength
and
the
favour
of
the
gods
might
serve
me
in
such
a
quest
but
methinks
that
this
woman
is
meeter
for
words
of
love
and
the
kisses
of
men
than
to
be
slain
with
the
sharp
sword
if
indeed
she
be
not
of
the
number
of
the
now
meriamun
flushed
and
frowned
it
is
not
fitting
so
to
talk
before
me
she
said
of
this
be
sure
that
if
the
witch
may
be
come
at
she
shall
be
slain
and
given
to
osiris
for
a
now
the
wanderer
saw
that
the
lady
meriamun
was
jealous
of
the
beauty
and
renown
and
love
of
her
who
dwelt
in
the
temple
and
was
called
the
strange
hathor
and
he
held
his
peace
for
he
knew
when
to
be
silent
ii
the
night
of
dread
the
feast
dragged
slowly
on
for
fear
was
of
the
company
the
men
and
women
were
silent
and
when
they
drank
it
was
as
if
one
had
poured
a
little
oil
on
a
dying
fire
life
flamed
up
in
them
for
a
moment
their
laughter
came
like
the
crackling
of
thorns
and
then
they
were
silent
again
meanwhile
the
wanderer
drank
little
waiting
to
see
what
should
come
but
the
queen
was
watching
him
whom
already
her
heart
desired
and
she
only
of
all
the
company
had
pleasure
in
this
banquet
suddenly
a
opened
behind
the
daïs
there
was
a
stir
in
the
hall
each
guest
turning
his
head
fearfully
for
all
expected
some
evil
tidings
but
it
was
only
the
entrance
of
those
who
bear
about
in
the
feasts
of
egypt
an
effigy
of
the
dead
the
likeness
of
a
mummy
carved
in
wood
and
who
cry
drink
o
king
and
be
glad
thou
shalt
soon
be
even
as
he
drink
and
be
the
stiff
swathed
figure
with
its
folded
hands
and
gilded
face
was
brought
before
the
pharaoh
and
meneptah
who
had
sat
long
in
sullen
brooding
silence
started
when
he
looked
on
it
then
he
broke
into
an
angry
laugh
we
have
little
need
of
thee
he
cried
as
he
saluted
the
symbol
of
osiris
death
is
near
enough
we
want
not
thy
silent
preaching
death
death
is
near
he
fell
back
in
his
gilded
chair
and
let
the
cup
drop
from
his
hand
gnawing
at
his
beard
art
thou
a
man
spoke
meriamun
in
a
low
clear
voice
are
you
men
and
yet
afraid
of
what
comes
to
all
is
it
only
that
we
first
hear
the
name
of
death
remember
the
great
remember
the
old
pharaoh
who
built
the
pyramid
of
hir
he
was
just
and
kind
and
he
feared
the
gods
and
for
his
reward
they
showed
him
death
coming
on
him
in
six
short
years
did
he
scowl
and
tremble
like
all
of
you
who
are
scared
by
the
threats
of
slaves
nay
he
outwitted
the
gods
he
made
night
into
day
he
lived
out
twice
his
years
with
revel
and
love
and
wine
in
the
groves
of
persea
trees
come
my
guests
let
us
be
merry
if
it
be
but
for
an
hour
drink
and
be
brave
for
once
thou
speakest
well
said
the
king
drink
and
forget
the
gods
who
give
death
give
wine
and
his
angry
eyes
ranged
through
the
hall
to
seek
some
occasion
of
mirth
and
scorn
thou
wanderer
he
said
suddenly
thou
drinkest
not
i
have
watched
thee
as
the
cups
go
round
what
man
thou
comest
from
the
north
the
sun
of
thy
pale
land
has
not
heat
enough
to
foster
the
vine
thou
seemest
cold
and
a
drinker
of
water
why
wilt
thou
be
cold
before
thine
hour
come
pledge
me
in
the
red
wine
of
khem
bring
forth
the
cup
of
pasht
he
cried
to
them
who
waited
bring
forth
the
cup
of
pasht
the
king
drinks
then
the
chief
butler
of
pharaoh
went
to
the
and
came
again
bearing
a
huge
golden
cup
fashioned
in
the
form
of
a
lion
s
head
and
holding
twelve
measures
of
wine
it
was
an
ancient
cup
sacred
to
pasht
and
a
gift
of
the
rutennu
to
thothmes
the
greatest
of
that
name
fill
it
full
of
unmixed
wine
cried
the
king
dost
thou
grow
pale
at
the
sight
of
the
cup
thou
wanderer
from
the
north
i
pledge
thee
pledge
thou
me
nay
king
said
the
wanderer
i
have
tasted
wine
of
ismarus
before
and
i
have
drunk
with
a
wild
host
the
man
eater
for
his
heart
was
angered
by
the
king
and
he
forgot
his
wisdom
but
the
queen
marked
the
saying
then
pledge
me
in
the
cup
of
pasht
quoth
the
king
i
pray
thee
pardon
me
said
the
wanderer
for
wine
makes
wise
men
foolish
and
strong
men
weak
and
methinks
we
shall
need
our
wits
and
our
craven
cried
the
king
give
me
the
bowl
i
drink
to
thy
better
courage
wanderer
and
lifting
the
great
golden
cup
he
stood
up
and
drank
it
and
then
dropped
staggering
into
his
chair
his
head
fallen
on
his
breast
i
may
not
refuse
a
king
s
challenge
though
it
is
ill
to
contend
with
our
hosts
said
the
wanderer
turning
somewhat
pale
for
he
was
in
anger
give
me
the
bowl
he
took
the
cup
and
held
it
high
then
pouring
a
little
forth
to
his
gods
he
said
in
a
clear
voice
for
he
was
stirred
to
anger
beyond
his
wont
drink
to
the
strange
hathor
he
spoke
and
drained
the
mighty
cup
and
set
it
down
on
the
board
and
even
as
he
laid
down
the
cup
and
as
the
queen
looked
at
him
with
eyes
of
wrath
there
came
from
the
bow
beside
his
seat
a
faint
shrill
sound
a
ringing
and
a
singing
of
the
bow
a
noise
of
running
strings
and
a
sound
as
of
rushing
arrows
the
warrior
heard
it
and
his
eyes
burned
with
the
light
of
battle
for
he
knew
well
that
the
swift
shafts
should
soon
fly
to
the
hearts
of
the
doomed
pharaoh
awoke
and
heard
it
and
heard
it
the
lady
meriamun
the
queen
and
she
looked
on
the
wanderer
astonished
and
looked
on
the
bow
that
sang
the
minstrel
s
tale
was
true
this
is
none
other
but
the
bow
of
odysseus
the
sacker
of
cities
said
meriamun
hearken
thou
eperitus
thy
great
bow
sings
aloud
how
comes
it
that
thy
bow
sings
for
this
cause
queen
said
the
wanderer
because
birds
gather
on
the
bridge
of
war
soon
shall
shafts
be
flying
and
ghosts
go
down
to
doom
summon
thy
guards
i
bid
thee
for
foes
are
terror
conquered
the
drunkenness
of
pharaoh
he
bade
the
guards
who
stood
behind
his
chair
summon
all
their
company
they
went
forth
and
a
great
hush
fell
again
upon
the
hall
of
banquets
and
upon
those
who
sat
at
meat
therein
the
silence
grew
deadly
still
like
air
before
the
thunder
and
men
s
hearts
sank
within
them
and
turned
to
water
in
their
breasts
only
odysseus
wondered
and
thought
on
the
battle
to
be
though
whence
the
foe
might
come
he
knew
not
and
meriamun
sat
erect
in
her
ivory
chair
and
looked
down
the
glorious
hall
deeper
grew
the
silence
and
deeper
yet
and
more
and
more
the
cloud
of
fear
gathered
in
the
hearts
of
men
then
suddenly
through
all
the
hall
there
was
a
rush
like
the
rush
of
mighty
wings
the
deep
foundations
of
the
palace
rocked
and
to
the
sight
of
men
the
roof
above
seemed
to
burst
asunder
and
lo
above
them
against
the
distance
of
the
sky
there
swept
a
shape
of
fear
and
the
stars
shone
through
its
raiment
then
the
roof
closed
in
again
and
for
a
moment
s
space
once
more
there
was
silence
whilst
men
looked
with
white
faces
each
on
each
and
even
the
stout
heart
of
the
wanderer
stood
still
then
suddenly
all
down
the
hall
from
this
place
and
from
that
men
rose
up
and
with
one
great
cry
fell
down
dead
this
one
across
the
board
and
that
one
across
the
floor
the
wanderer
grasped
his
bow
and
counted
from
among
those
who
sat
at
meat
twenty
and
one
had
fallen
dead
yet
those
who
lived
sat
gazing
emptily
for
so
stricken
with
fear
were
they
that
scarce
did
each
one
know
if
it
was
he
himself
who
lay
dead
or
his
brother
who
had
sat
by
his
side
but
meriamun
looked
down
the
hall
with
cold
eyes
for
she
feared
neither
death
nor
life
nor
god
nor
man
and
while
she
looked
and
while
the
wanderer
counted
there
rose
a
faint
murmuring
sound
from
the
city
without
a
sound
that
grew
and
grew
the
thunder
of
myriad
feet
that
run
before
the
death
of
kings
then
the
doors
burst
asunder
and
a
woman
sped
through
them
in
her
night
robes
and
in
her
arms
she
bore
the
naked
body
of
a
boy
pharaoh
she
cried
pharaoh
and
thou
o
queen
look
upon
thy
son
thy
firstborn
son
dead
is
thy
son
o
pharaoh
dead
is
thy
son
o
queen
in
my
arms
he
died
suddenly
as
i
lulled
him
to
his
rest
and
she
laid
the
body
of
the
child
down
on
the
board
among
the
vessels
of
gold
among
the
garlands
of
lotus
flowers
and
the
beakers
of
wine
then
pharaoh
rose
and
rent
his
purple
robes
and
wept
aloud
meriamun
rose
too
and
lifting
the
body
of
her
son
clasped
it
to
her
breast
and
her
eyes
were
terrible
with
wrath
and
grief
but
she
wept
not
see
now
the
curse
that
this
evil
woman
this
false
hathor
hath
brought
upon
us
she
said
but
the
very
guests
sprang
up
crying
it
is
not
the
hathor
whom
we
worship
it
is
not
the
holy
hathor
it
is
the
gods
of
those
dark
apura
whom
thou
o
queen
wilt
not
let
go
on
thy
head
and
the
head
of
pharaoh
be
it
and
even
as
they
cried
the
murmur
without
grew
to
a
shriek
of
woe
a
shriek
so
wild
and
terrible
that
the
palace
walls
rang
again
that
shriek
rose
and
yet
a
third
time
never
was
such
a
cry
heard
in
egypt
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
days
the
face
of
the
wanderer
grew
white
with
fear
and
in
fear
of
heart
he
prayed
for
succour
to
his
goddess
to
aphrodite
the
daughter
of
dione
again
the
doors
behind
them
burst
open
and
the
guards
flocked
in
mighty
men
of
many
foreign
lands
but
now
their
faces
were
wan
their
eyes
stared
wide
and
their
jaws
hung
down
but
at
the
sound
of
the
clanging
of
their
harness
the
strength
of
the
wanderer
came
back
to
him
again
for
the
gods
and
their
vengeance
he
feared
but
not
the
sword
of
man
and
now
once
more
the
bow
sang
aloud
he
grasped
it
he
bent
it
with
his
mighty
knee
and
strung
it
crying
awake
pharaoh
awake
foes
draw
on
say
be
these
all
the
men
then
the
captain
answered
these
be
all
of
the
guard
who
are
left
living
in
the
palace
the
rest
are
stark
smitten
by
the
angry
now
as
the
captain
spake
one
came
running
up
the
hall
heeding
neither
the
dead
nor
the
living
it
was
the
old
priest
rei
the
commander
of
the
legion
of
amen
who
had
been
the
wanderer
s
guide
and
his
looks
were
wild
with
fear
hearken
pharaoh
he
cried
thy
people
lie
dead
by
thousands
in
the
streets
the
houses
are
full
of
dead
in
the
temples
of
ptah
and
amen
many
of
the
priests
have
fallen
dead
hast
thou
more
to
tell
old
man
cried
the
queen
the
tale
has
not
all
been
told
o
queen
the
soldiers
are
mad
with
fear
and
with
the
sight
of
death
and
slay
their
captains
barely
have
i
escaped
from
those
in
my
command
of
the
legion
of
amen
for
they
swear
that
this
death
has
been
brought
upon
the
land
because
the
pharaoh
will
not
let
the
apura
go
hither
then
they
come
to
slay
the
pharaoh
and
thee
also
o
queen
and
with
them
come
many
thousands
of
people
catching
up
such
arms
as
lie
to
their
now
pharaoh
sank
down
groaning
but
the
queen
spake
to
the
wanderer
anon
thy
weapon
sang
of
war
eperitus
now
war
is
at
the
little
i
fear
the
rush
of
battle
and
the
blows
men
deal
in
anger
lady
he
made
answer
though
a
man
may
fear
the
gods
without
shame
ho
guards
close
up
close
up
round
me
look
not
so
now
death
from
the
gods
is
done
with
and
we
have
but
to
fear
the
sword
of
so
great
was
his
mien
and
so
glorious
his
face
as
he
cried
thus
and
one
by
one
drew
his
long
arrows
forth
and
laid
them
on
the
board
that
the
trembling
guards
took
heart
and
to
the
number
of
fifty
and
one
ranged
themselves
on
the
edge
of
the
daïs
in
a
double
line
then
they
also
made
ready
their
bows
and
loosened
the
arrows
in
their
quivers
now
from
without
there
came
a
roar
of
men
and
anon
while
those
of
the
house
of
pharaoh
and
of
the
guests
and
nobles
who
sat
at
the
feast
and
yet
lived
fled
behind
the
soldiers
the
brazen
doors
were
burst
in
with
mighty
blows
and
through
them
a
great
armed
multitude
surged
along
the
hall
there
came
soldiers
broken
from
their
ranks
there
came
the
embalmers
of
the
dead
their
hands
were
overfull
of
work
but
they
left
their
work
undone
death
had
smitten
some
even
of
these
and
their
fellows
did
not
shrink
back
from
them
now
there
came
the
smith
black
from
the
forge
and
the
scribe
bowed
with
endless
writing
and
the
dyer
with
his
purple
hands
and
the
fisher
from
the
stream
and
the
stunted
weaver
from
the
loom
and
the
leper
from
the
temple
gates
they
were
mad
with
lust
of
life
a
starveling
life
that
the
king
had
taxed
when
he
let
not
the
apura
go
they
were
mad
with
fear
of
death
their
women
followed
them
with
dead
children
in
their
arms
they
smote
down
the
golden
furnishings
they
tore
the
silken
hangings
they
cast
the
empty
cups
of
the
feast
at
the
faces
of
trembling
ladies
and
cried
aloud
for
the
blood
of
the
king
where
is
pharaoh
they
yelled
show
us
pharaoh
and
the
queen
meriamun
that
we
may
slay
them
dead
are
our
first
born
they
lie
in
heaps
as
the
fish
lay
when
sihor
ran
red
with
blood
dead
are
they
because
of
the
curse
that
has
been
brought
upon
us
by
the
prophets
of
the
apura
whom
pharaoh
and
pharaoh
s
queen
yet
hold
in
now
as
they
cried
they
saw
pharaoh
meneptah
cowering
behind
the
double
line
of
guards
and
they
saw
the
queen
meriamun
who
cowered
not
but
stood
silent
above
the
din
then
she
thrust
her
way
through
the
guards
and
yet
holding
the
body
of
the
child
to
her
breast
she
stood
before
them
with
eyes
that
flashed
more
brightly
than
the
uraeus
crown
upon
her
brow
back
she
cried
back
it
is
not
pharaoh
it
is
not
i
who
have
brought
this
death
upon
you
for
we
too
have
death
here
and
she
held
up
the
body
of
her
dead
son
it
is
that
false
hathor
whom
ye
worship
that
witch
of
many
a
voice
and
many
a
face
who
turns
your
hearts
faint
with
love
for
her
sake
ye
endure
these
woes
on
her
head
is
all
this
death
go
tear
her
temple
stone
from
stone
and
rend
her
beauty
limb
from
limb
and
be
avenged
and
free
the
land
from
a
moment
the
people
stood
and
hearkened
muttering
as
stands
the
lion
that
is
about
to
spring
while
those
who
pressed
without
cried
forward
forward
slay
them
slay
them
then
as
with
one
voice
they
screamed
the
hathor
we
love
but
you
we
hate
for
ye
have
brought
these
woes
upon
us
and
ye
shall
they
cried
they
brawled
they
cast
footstools
and
stones
at
the
guards
and
then
a
certain
tall
man
among
them
drew
a
bow
straight
at
the
queen
s
fair
breast
he
aimed
his
arrow
and
swift
and
true
it
sped
towards
her
she
saw
the
light
gleam
upon
its
shining
barb
and
then
she
did
what
no
woman
but
meriamun
would
have
done
no
not
to
save
herself
from
death
she
held
out
the
naked
body
of
her
son
as
a
warrior
holds
a
shield
the
arrow
struck
through
and
through
it
piercing
the
tender
flesh
aye
and
pricked
her
breast
beyond
so
that
she
let
the
dead
boy
fall
the
wanderer
saw
it
and
wondered
at
the
horror
of
the
deed
for
he
had
seen
no
such
deed
in
all
his
days
then
shouting
aloud
the
terrible
of
the
achæans
he
leapt
upon
the
board
before
him
and
as
he
leapt
his
golden
armour
clanged
glancing
around
he
fixed
an
arrow
to
the
string
and
drew
to
his
ear
that
great
bow
which
none
but
he
might
so
much
as
bend
then
as
he
loosed
the
string
sang
like
a
swallow
and
the
shaft
screamed
through
the
air
down
the
glorious
hall
it
sped
and
full
on
the
breast
of
him
who
had
lifted
bow
against
the
queen
the
bitter
arrow
struck
nor
might
his
harness
avail
to
stay
it
through
the
body
of
him
it
passed
and
with
feathers
flew
on
and
smote
another
who
stood
behind
him
so
that
his
knees
also
were
loosened
and
together
they
fell
dead
upon
the
floor
now
while
the
people
stared
and
wondered
again
the
bowstring
sang
like
a
swallow
again
the
arrow
screamed
in
its
flight
and
he
who
stood
before
it
got
his
death
for
the
shield
he
bore
was
pinned
to
his
breast
then
wonder
turned
to
rage
the
multitude
rolled
forward
and
from
either
side
the
air
grew
dark
with
arrows
for
the
guards
at
the
sight
of
the
shooting
of
the
wanderer
found
heart
and
fought
well
and
manfully
boldly
also
the
slayers
came
on
and
behind
them
pressed
many
a
hundred
men
the
wanderer
s
golden
helm
flashed
steadily
a
beacon
in
the
storm
black
smoke
burst
out
in
the
hall
the
hangings
flamed
and
tossed
in
a
wind
from
the
open
door
the
lights
were
struck
from
the
hands
of
the
golden
images
arrows
stood
thick
in
the
tables
and
the
rafters
a
spear
pierced
through
the
golden
cup
of
pasht
but
out
of
the
darkness
and
smoke
and
dust
and
the
cry
of
battle
and
through
the
rushing
of
the
rain
of
spears
sang
the
swallow
string
of
the
black
bow
of
eurytus
and
the
long
shafts
shrieked
as
they
sped
on
them
who
were
ripe
to
die
in
vain
did
the
arrows
of
the
slayers
smite
upon
that
golden
harness
they
were
but
as
hail
upon
the
temple
roofs
but
as
driving
snow
upon
the
wild
stag
s
horns
they
struck
they
rattled
and
down
they
dropped
like
snow
or
bounded
back
and
lay
upon
the
board
the
swallow
string
sang
the
black
bow
twanged
and
the
bitter
arrows
shrieked
as
they
flew
now
the
wanderer
s
shafts
were
spent
and
he
judged
that
their
case
was
desperate
for
out
of
the
doors
of
the
hall
that
were
behind
them
and
from
the
chambers
of
the
women
armed
men
burst
in
also
taking
them
on
the
flank
and
rear
but
the
wanderer
was
old
in
war
and
without
a
match
in
all
its
ways
the
captain
of
the
guard
was
slain
with
a
spear
stroke
and
the
wanderer
took
his
place
calling
to
the
men
such
of
them
as
were
left
alive
to
form
a
circle
on
the
daïs
and
within
the
circle
he
set
those
of
the
house
of
pharaoh
and
the
women
who
were
at
the
feast
and
to
pharaoh
he
cast
a
slain
man
s
sword
bidding
him
strike
for
life
and
throne
if
he
never
struck
before
but
the
heart
was
out
of
pharaoh
because
of
the
death
of
his
son
and
the
wine
about
his
wits
and
the
terrors
he
had
seen
then
meriamun
the
queen
snatched
the
sword
from
his
trembling
hand
and
stood
holding
it
to
guard
her
life
for
she
disdained
to
crouch
upon
the
ground
as
did
the
other
women
but
stood
upright
behind
the
wanderer
and
heeded
not
the
spears
and
arrows
that
dealt
death
on
every
hand
but
pharaoh
stood
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
now
the
slayers
came
on
shouting
and
clambering
upon
the
daïs
then
the
wanderer
rushed
on
them
with
sword
drawn
and
shield
on
high
and
so
swift
he
smote
that
men
might
not
guard
for
they
saw
as
it
were
three
blades
aloft
at
once
and
the
sword
bit
deep
the
gift
of
phæacian
euryalus
long
ago
the
guards
also
smote
and
thrust
it
was
for
their
lives
they
fought
and
back
rolled
the
tide
of
foes
leaving
a
swathe
of
dead
so
a
second
time
they
came
on
and
a
second
time
were
rolled
back
now
of
the
defenders
few
were
left
unhurt
and
their
strength
was
spent
but
the
wanderer
cheered
them
with
great
words
though
his
heart
grew
fearful
for
the
end
and
meriamun
the
queen
also
bade
them
to
be
of
good
courage
and
if
need
were
to
die
like
men
then
once
again
the
wave
of
war
rolled
in
upon
them
and
the
strife
grew
fierce
and
desperate
the
iron
hedge
of
spears
was
broken
and
now
the
wanderer
doing
such
deeds
as
had
not
been
known
in
khem
stood
alone
between
meriamun
the
queen
and
the
swords
that
thirsted
for
her
life
and
the
life
of
pharaoh
then
of
a
sudden
from
far
down
the
great
hall
of
banquets
there
came
a
loud
cry
that
shrilled
above
the
clash
of
swords
the
groans
of
men
and
all
the
din
of
battle
pharaoh
pharaoh
rose
a
voice
now
wilt
thou
let
the
people
go
then
he
who
smote
stayed
his
hand
and
he
who
guarded
dropped
his
shield
the
battle
ceased
and
all
turned
to
look
there
at
the
end
of
the
hall
among
the
dead
and
dying
there
stood
the
two
ancient
men
of
the
apura
and
in
their
hands
were
cedar
rods
it
is
the
wizards
the
wizards
of
the
apura
men
cried
and
shrunk
this
way
and
that
thinking
no
more
on
war
the
ancient
men
drew
nigh
they
took
no
heed
of
the
dying
or
the
dead
on
they
walked
through
blood
and
wine
and
fallen
tables
and
scattered
arms
till
they
stood
before
the
pharaoh
pharaoh
pharaoh
they
cried
again
dead
are
the
of
khem
at
the
hand
of
jahveh
wilt
thou
let
the
people
go
then
pharaoh
lifted
his
face
and
cried
get
you
gone
you
and
all
that
is
yours
get
you
gone
swiftly
and
let
khem
see
your
face
no
the
people
heard
and
the
living
left
the
hall
and
silence
fell
on
the
city
and
on
the
dead
who
died
of
the
sword
and
the
dead
who
died
of
the
pestilence
silence
fell
and
sleep
and
the
gods
best
gift
forgetfulness
iii
the
baths
of
bronze
even
out
of
this
night
of
dread
the
morning
rose
and
with
it
came
rei
bearing
a
message
from
the
king
but
he
did
not
find
the
wanderer
in
his
chamber
the
palace
eunuchs
said
that
he
had
risen
and
had
asked
for
kurri
the
captain
of
the
sidonians
who
was
now
the
queen
s
jeweller
thither
rei
went
for
kurri
was
lodged
with
the
servants
in
a
court
of
the
royal
house
and
as
the
old
man
came
he
heard
the
sound
of
hammers
beating
on
metal
there
in
the
shadow
which
the
palace
wall
cast
into
a
little
court
there
was
the
wanderer
no
longer
in
his
golden
mail
but
with
bare
arms
and
dressed
in
such
a
light
smock
as
the
workmen
of
khem
were
wont
to
wear
the
wanderer
was
bending
over
a
small
brazier
whence
a
flame
and
a
light
blue
smoke
arose
and
melted
into
the
morning
light
in
his
hand
he
held
a
small
hammer
and
he
had
a
little
anvil
by
him
on
which
lay
one
of
the
golden
of
his
armour
the
other
pieces
were
heaped
beside
the
brazier
kurri
the
sidonian
stood
beside
him
with
graving
tools
in
his
hands
hail
to
thee
eperitus
cried
rei
calling
him
by
the
name
he
had
chosen
to
give
himself
what
makest
thou
here
with
fire
and
anvil
i
am
but
furbishing
up
my
armour
said
the
wanderer
smiling
it
has
more
than
one
dint
from
the
fight
in
the
hall
and
he
pointed
to
his
shield
which
was
deeply
scarred
across
the
blazon
of
the
white
bull
the
cognizance
of
dead
paris

blow
up
the
kurri
crouched
on
his
hams
and
blew
the
blaze
to
a
white
heat
with
a
pair
of
leathern
bellows
while
the
wanderer
fitted
the
plates
and
hammered
at
them
on
the
anvil
making
the
jointures
smooth
and
strong
talking
meanwhile
with
rei
strange
work
for
a
prince
as
thou
must
be
in
alybas
whence
thou
comest
quoth

leaning
on
his
long
rod
of
cedar
headed
with
an
apple
of
bluestone
in
our
country

not
labour
with
their
different
lands
different
ways
answered
eperitus
in
my
country
men
wed
not
their
sisters
as
your
kings
do
though
indeed
it
comes
into
my
mind
that
once
i
met
such
brides
in
my
wanderings
in
the
isle
of
the
king
of
the
for
the
thought
of
the
æolian
isle
where
king
æolus
gave
him
all
the
winds
in
a
bag
came
into
his
memory
my
hands
can
serve
me
in
every
need
he
went
on
mowing
the
deep
green
grass
in
spring
or
driving
oxen
or
cutting
a
clean
furrow
with
the
plough
in
heavy
soil
or
building
houses
and
ships
or
doing
smith

work
with
gold
and
bronze
and
grey
iron
they
are
all
one
to

the
work
of

said
rei
for
there
i
have
seen
thee

now
listen
thou
wanderer
the
king
meneptah
and
the
queen
meriamun
send
me
to
thee
with
this
scroll
of
their
will
and
he
drew
forth
a
roll
of
papyrus
bound
with
golden
threads
and
held
it
on
his
forehead
bowing
as
if
he
prayed
what
is
that
roll
of
thine
said
the
wanderer
who
was
hammering
at
the
bronze
that
stood
fast
in
his
helm
rei
undid
the
golden
threads
and
opened
the
scroll
which
he
gave
into
the
wanderer
s
hand
gods
what
have
we
here
said
the
wanderer
here
are
pictures
tiny
and
cunningly
drawn
serpents
in
red
and
little
figures
of
men
sitting
or
standing
axes
and
snakes
and
birds
and
beetles
my
father
what
tokens
are
these
and
he
gave
the
scroll
back
to
rei
the
king
has
made
his
chief
scribe
write
to
thee
naming
thee
captain
of
the
legion
of
pasht
the
guard
of
the
royal
house
for
last
night
the
captain
was
slain
he
gives
thee
a
high
title
and
he
promises
thee
houses
lands
and
a
city
of
the
south
to
furnish
thee
with
wine
and
a
city
of
the
north
to
furnish
thee
with
corn
if
thou
wilt
be
his
never

i
served
any
man
said
the
wanderer
flushing
red
though
i
went
near
to
being
sold
and
to
knowing
the
day
of
slavery
the
king
does
me
too
much
thou
wouldest
fain
begone
from
khem
asked
the
old
man
eagerly
i
would
fain
find
her
i
came
to
seek
wherever
she
may
be
said
the
wanderer
here
or
then
what
answer
shall
i
carry
to
the
king
time

thought
said
the
wanderer
i
would
see
the
city
if
thou
wilt
guide
me
many
cities
have
i
seen
but
none
so
great
as
this
as
we
walk
i
will
consider
my
answer
to
your
he
had
been
working
at
his
helm
as
he
spoke
for
the
rest
of
his
armour
was
now
mended
he
had
drawn
out
the
sharp
of
bronze
and
was
balancing
it
in
his
hand
and
trying
its
edge
a
good
blade
he
said
better
was
never
hammered
it
went
near
to
doing
its
work
sidonian
and
he
turned
to
kurri
as
he
spoke
two
things
of
thine
i
had
thy
life
and
thy
thy
life
i
gave
thee
thy
thou
didst
lend
me
here
take
it
again
and
he
tossed
the
to
the
queen
s
jeweller
i
thank
thee
lord
answered
the
sidonian
thrusting
it
in
his
girdle
but
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
the
gifts
of
enemies
are
gifts
of
the
wanderer
did
on
his
mail
set
the
helmet
on
his
head
and
spoke
to
rei
come
forth
friend
and
show
me
thy
but
rei
was
watching
the
smile
on
the
face
of
the
sidonian
and
he
deemed
it
cruel
and
crafty
and
warlike
like
the
laugh
of
the
sardana
of
the
sea
he
said
nought
but
called
a
guard
of
soldiers
and
with
the
wanderer
he
passed
the
palace
gates
and
went
out
into
the
city
the
sight
was
strange
and
it
was
not
thus
that
the
old
man
who
loved
his
land
would
have
had
the
wanderer
see
it
from
all
the
wealthy
houses
and
from
many
of
the
poorer
sort
rang
the
wail
of
the
women
mourners
as
they
sang
their
dirges
for
the
dead
but
in
the
meaner
quarters
many
a
hovel
was
marked
with
three
smears
of
blood
dashed
on
each
pillar
of
the
door
and
on
the
lintel
and
the
sound
that
came
from
these
dwellings
was
the
cry
of
mirth
and
festival
there
were
two
peoples
one
laughed
one
lamented
and
in
and
out
of
the
houses
marked
with
the
splashes
of
blood
women
were
ever
going
with
empty
hands
or
coming
with
hands
full
of
jewels
of
gold
of
silver
rings
of
cups
and
purple
stuffs
empty
they
went
out
laden
they
came
in
dark
men
and
women
with
keen
black
eyes
and
the
features
of
birds
of
prey
they
went
they
came
they
clamoured
with
delight
among
the
mourning
of
the
men
and
women
of
khem
and
none
laid
a
hand
on
them
none
refused
them
one
tall
fellow
snatched
at
the
staff
of
rei
lend
me
thy
staff
old
man
he
said
sneering
lend
me
thy
jewelled
staff
for
my
journey
i
do
but
borrow
it
when
yakûb
comes
from
the
desert
thou
shalt
have
it
but
the
wanderer
turned
on
the
fellow
with
such
a
glance
that
he
fell
back
i
have
seen
before
he
said
and
he
laughed
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
i
saw
thee
last
night
at
the
feast
and
heard
thy
great
bow
sing
thou
art
not
of
the
folk
of
khem
they
are
a
gentle
folk
and
yakûb
wins
favour
in
their
what
passes
now
in
this
haunted
land
of
thine
old
man
said
the
wanderer
for
of
all
the
sights
that
i
have
seen
this
is
the
strangest
none
lifts
a
hand
to
save
his
goods
from
the
rei
the
priest
groaned
aloud
evil
days
have
come
upon
khem
he
said
the
apura
spoil
the
people
of
khem
ere
they
fly
into
the
even
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
great
lady
weeping
for
her
husband
was
dead
and
her
son
and
her
brother
all
were
gone
in
the
breath
of
the
pestilence
she
was
of
the
royal
house
and
richly
decked
with
gold
and
jewels
and
the
slaves
who
fanned
her
as
she
went
to
the
temple
of
ptah
to
worship
wore
gold
chains
upon
their
necks
two
women
of
the
apura
saw
her
and
ran
to
her
crying
lend
to
us
those
golden
ornaments
thou
then
without
a
word
she
took
her
gold
bracelets
and
chains
and
rings
and
let
them
all
fall
in
a
heap
at
her
feet
the
women
of
the
apura
took
them
all
and
mocked
her
crying
where
now
is
thy
husband
and
thy
son
and
thy
brother
thou
who
art
of
pharaoh
s
house
now
thou
payest
us
for
the
labour
of
our
hands
and
for
the
bricks
that
we
made
without
straw
gathering
leaves
and
rushes
in
the
sun
now
thou
payest
for
the
stick
in
the
hand
of
the
overseers
where
now
is
thy
husband
and
thy
son
and
thy
brother
and
they
went
still
mocking
and
left
the
lady
weeping
but
of
all
sights
the
wanderer
held
this
strangest
and
many
such
there
were
to
see
at
first
he
would
have
taken
back
the
spoil
and
given
it
to
those
who
wore
it
but
rei
the
priest
prayed
him
to
forbear
lest
the
curse
should
strike
them
also
so
they
pressed
on
through
the
tumult
ever
seeing
new
sights
of
greed
and
death
and
sorrow
here
a
mother
wept
over
her
babe
here
a
bride
over
her
husband
that
night
the
groom
of
her
and
of
death
here
the
apura
clamouring
like
gulls
tore
the
silver
trinkets
from
the
children
of
those
of
the
baser
sort
or
the
sacred
amulets
from
the
mummies
of
those
who
were
laid
out
for
burial
and
here
a
wailed
over
the
carcass
of
the
ass
that
won
him
his
livelihood
at
length
passing
through
the
crowd
they
came
to
a
temple
that
stood
near
to
the
temple
of
the
god
ptah
the
pylons
of
this
temple
faced
towards
the
houses
of
the
city
but
the
inner
courts
were
built
against
the
walls
of
tanis
and
looked
out
across
the
face
of
the
water
though
not
one
of
the
largest
temples
it
was
very
strong
and
beautiful
in
its
shape
it
was
built
of
the
black
stone
of
syene
and
all
the
polished
face
of
the
stone
was
graven
with
images
of
the
holy
hathor
here
she
wore
a
cow
s
head
and
here
the
face
of
a
woman
but
she
always
bore
in
her
hands
the
staff
and
the
holy
token
of
life
and
her
neck
was
encircled
with
the
collar
of
the
gods
here
dwells
that
strange
hathor
to
whom
thou
didst
drink
last
night
eperitus
said
rei
the
priest
it
was
a
wild
pledge
to
drink
before
the
queen
who
swears
that
she
brings
these
woes
on
khem
though
indeed
she
is
guiltless
of
this
with
all
the
blood
on
her
beautiful
head
the
apura
and
their
apostate
sorcerer
whom
we
ourselves
instructed
bring
the
plagues
on
does
the
hathor
manifest
herself
this
day
asked
the
wanderer
that
we
will
ask
of
the
priests
eperitus
follow
thou
now
they
passed
down
the
avenue
of
sphinxes
within
the
wall
of
brick
into
the
garden
plot
of
the
goddess
and
so
on
through
the
gates
of
the
outer
tower
a
priest
who
watched
there
threw
them
wide
at
the
sign
that
was
given
of
rei
the
the
beloved
of
pharaoh
and
they
came
to
the
outer
court
before
the
second
tower
they
halted
and
rei
showed
to
the
wanderer
that
place
upon
the
pylon
roof
where
the
hathor
was
wont
to
stand
and
sing
till
the
hearers
hearts
were
melted
like
wax
here
they
knocked
once
more
and
were
admitted
to
the
hall
of
assembly
where
the
priests
were
gathered
throwing
dust
upon
their
heads
and
mourning
those
among
them
who
had
died
with
the
firstborn
when
they
saw
rei
the
instructed
the
prophet
of
amen
and
the
wanderer
clad
in
golden
armour
who
was
with
him
they
ceased
from
their
mourning
and
an
ancient
priest
of
their
number
came
forward
and
greeting
rei
asked
him
of
his
errand
then
rei
took
the
wanderer
by
the
hand
and
made
him
known
to
the
priest
and
told
him
of
those
deeds
that
he
had
done
and
how
he
had
saved
the
life
of
pharaoh
and
of
those
of
the
royal
house
who
sat
at
the
feast
with
pharaoh
but
when
will
the
lady
hathor
sing
upon
her
tower
top
said
rei
for
the
stranger
desires
to
see
her
and
hear
the
temple
priest
bowed
before
the
wanderer
and
answered
gravely
on
the
third
morn
from
now
the
holy
hathor
shows
herself
upon
the
temple
s
top
he
said
but
thou
mighty
lord
who
art
risen
from
the
sea
hearken
to
my
warning
and
if
indeed
thou
art
no
god
dare
not
to
look
upon
her
beauty
if
thou
dost
look
then
thy
fate
shall
be
as
the
fate
of
those
who
have
looked
before
and
have
loved
and
have
died
for
the
sake
of
the
no
god
am
i
said
the
wanderer
laughing
yet
perchance
i
shall
dare
to
look
and
dare
to
face
whatever
it
be
that
guards
her
if
my
heart
bids
me
see
her
then
there
shall
be
an
end
of
thee
and
thy
wanderings
said
the
priest
now
follow
me
and
i
will
show
thee
those
men
who
last
sought
to
win
the
he
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
through
passages
hewn
in
the
walls
till
they
came
to
a
deep
and
gloomy
cell
where
the
golden
armour
of
the
wanderer
shone
like
a
lamp
at
eve
the
cell
was
built
against
the
city
wall
and
scarcely
a
thread
of
light
came
into
the
chink
between
roof
and
wall
all
about
the
chamber
were
baths
fashioned
of
bronze
and
in
the
baths
lay
dusky
shapes
of
men
of
egypt
there
they
lay
and
in
the
faint
light
their
limbs
were
being
anointed
by
some
attendants
as
folk
were
anointed
by
merry
girls
in
the
shining
baths
of
the
wanderer
s
home
when
rei
and
eperitus
came
near
the
shrank
away
in
shame
as
dogs
shrink
from
their
evil
meat
at
night
when
a
traveller
goes
past
marvelling
at
the
strange
sight
the
bathers
and
the
bathed
the
wanderer
looked
more
closely
and
his
stout
heart
sank
within
him
for
all
these
were
dead
who
lay
in
the
baths
of
bronze
and
it
was
not
water
that
flowed
about
their
limbs
but
natron
here
lie
those
said
the
priest
who
last
strove
to
come
near
the
holy
hathor
and
to
pass
into
the
shrine
of
the
temple
where
night
and
day
she
sits
and
sings
and
weaves
with
her
golden
shuttle
here
they
lie
the
half
of
a
score
one
by
one
they
rushed
to
embrace
her
and
one
by
one
they
were
smitten
down
here
they
are
being
attired
for
the
tomb
for
we
give
them
all
rich
truly
quoth
the
wanderer
i
left
the
world
of
light
behind
me
when
i
looked
on
the
sea
and
sailed
into
the
black
gloom
off
pharos
more
evil
sights
have
i
seen
in
this
haunted
land
than
in
all
the
cities
where
i
have
wandered
and
on
all
the
seas
that
i
have
then
be
warned
said
the
priest
for
if
thou
dost
follow
where
they
went
and
desire
what
they
desired
thou
too
shalt
lie
in
yonder
bath
and
be
washed
of
yonder
waters
for
whatever
be
false
this
is
true
that
he
who
seeks
love
ofttimes
finds
doom
but
here
he
finds
it
most
the
wanderer
looked
again
at
the
dead
and
at
their
ministers
and
he
shuddered
till
his
harness
rattled
he
feared
not
the
face
of
death
in
war
or
on
the
sea
but
this
was
a
new
thing
little
he
loved
the
sight
of
the
brazen
baths
and
those
who
lay
there
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
breath
of
air
seemed
good
to
him
and
he
stepped
quickly
from
the
chamber
while
the
priest
smiled
to
himself
but
when
he
reached
the
outer
air
his
heart
came
back
to
him
and
he
began
to
ask
again
about
the
hathor
where
she
dwelt
and
what
it
was
that
slew
her
lovers
i
will
show
thee
answered
the
priest
and
brought
him
through
the
hall
of
assembly
to
a
certain
narrow
way
that
led
to
a
court
in
the
centre
of
the
court
stood
the
holy
shrine
of
the
hathor
it
was
a
great
chamber
built
of
alabaster
lighted
from
the
roof
alone
and
shut
in
with
brazen
doors
before
which
hung
curtains
of
tyrian
web
from
the
roof
of
the
shrine
a
stairway
ran
overhead
to
the
roof
of
the
temple
and
so
to
the
inner
pylon
tower
yonder
stranger
the
holy
goddess
dwells
within
the
alabaster
shrine
said
the
priest
by
that
stair
she
passes
to
the
temple
roof
and
thence
to
the
pylon
top
there
by
the
curtains
once
in
every
day
we
place
food
and
it
is
drawn
into
the
sanctuary
how
we
know
not
for
none
of
us
have
set
foot
there
nor
seen
the
hathor
face
to
face
now
when
the
goddess
has
stood
upon
the
pylon
and
sung
to
the
multitude
below
she
passes
back
to
the
shrine
then
the
brazen
outer
doors
of
the
temple
court
are
thrown
wide
and
the
doomed
rush
on
madly
one
by
one
towards
the
drawn
curtains
but
before
they
pass
the
curtains
they
are
thrust
back
yet
they
strive
to
pass
then
we
hear
a
sound
of
the
clashing
of
weapons
and
the
men
fall
dead
without
a
word
while
the
song
of
the
hathor
swells
from
and
who
are
her
swordsmen
said
the
wanderer
that
we
know
not
stranger
no
man
has
lived
to
tell
come
draw
near
to
the
door
of
the
shrine
and
hearken
maybe
thou
wilt
hear
the
hathor
singing
have
no
fear
thou
needst
not
approach
the
guarded
then
the
wanderer
drew
near
with
a
doubting
heart
but
rei
the
priest
stood
afar
off
though
the
temple
priests
came
close
enough
at
the
curtains
they
stopped
and
listened
then
from
within
the
shrine
there
came
a
sound
of
singing
wild
and
sweet
and
shrill
and
the
voice
of
it
stirred
the
wanderer
strangely
bringing
to
his
mind
memories
of
that
ithaca
of
which
he
was
lord
and
which
he
should
see
no
more
of
the
happy
days
of
youth
and
of
the
walls
of
windy
ilios
but
he
could
not
have
told
why
he
thought
on
these
things
nor
why
his
heart
was
thus
strangely
stirred
within
him
hearken
the
hathor
sings
as
she
weaves
the
doom
of
men
said
the
priest
and
as
he
spoke
the
singing
ended
then
the
wanderer
took
counsel
with
himself
whether
he
should
then
and
there
burst
the
doors
and
take
his
fortune
or
whether
he
should
forbear
for
that
while
but
in
the
end
he
determined
to
forbear
and
see
with
his
own
eyes
what
befell
those
who
strove
to
win
the
way
so
he
drew
back
wondering
much
and
bidding
farewell
to
the
aged
priest
he
went
with
rei
the
master
builder
through
the
town
of
tanis
where
the
apura
were
still
spoiling
the
people
of
khem
and
he
came
to
the
palace
where
he
was
lodged
here
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
how
he
might
see
the
strange
woman
of
the
temple
and
yet
escape
the
baths
of
bronze
there
he
sat
and
thought
till
at
length
the
night
drew
on
and
one
came
to
summon
him
to
sup
with
pharaoh
in
the
hall
then
he
rose
up
and
went
and
meeting
pharaoh
and
meriamun
the
queen
in
the
outer
chamber
passed
in
after
them
to
the
hall
and
on
to
the
daïs
which
he
had
held
against
the
rabble
for
the
place
was
clear
of
dead
and
save
for
certain
stains
upon
the
marble
floor
that
might
not
be
washed
away
and
for
some
few
arrows
that
yet
were
fixed
high
up
in
the
walls
or
in
the
lofty
roof
there
was
nothing
to
tell
of
the
great
fray
that
had
been
fought
but
one
day
gone
heavy
was
the
face
of
pharaoh
and
the
few
who
sat
with
him
were
sad
enough
because
of
the
death
of
so
many
whom
they
loved
and
the
shame
and
sorrow
that
had
fallen
upon
khem
but
there
were
no
tears
for
her
one
child
in
the
eyes
of
meriamun
the
queen
anger
not
grief
tore
her
heart
because
pharaoh
had
let
the
apura
go
for
ever
as
they
sat
at
the
sad
feast
there
came
a
sound
of
the
tramping
feet
of
armies
and
of
lowing
cattle
and
songs
of
triumph
sung
by
ten
thousand
voices
and
thus
they
sang
the
song
of
the
apura
a
lamp
for
our
feet
the
lord
hath
litten
signs
hath
he
shown
in
the
land
of
khem
the
kings
of
the
nations
our
lord
hath
smitten
his
shoe
hath
he
cast
o
er
the
gods
of
them
he
hath
made
him
a
mock
of
the
heifer
of
isis
he
hath
broken
the
chariot
reins
of
ra
on
yakûb
he
cries
and
his
folk
arises
and
the
knees
of
the
nation
are
loosed
in
awe
he
gives
us
their
goods
for
a
spoil
to
gather
jewels
of
silver
and
vessels
of
gold
for
yahveh
of
old
is
our
friend
and
father
and
cherisheth
yakûb
he
chose
of
old
the
gods
of
the
peoples
our
lord
hath
chidden
their
courts
hath
he
filled
with
his
creeping
things
the
light
of
the
face
of
the
sun
he
hath
hidden
and
broken
the
scourge
in
the
hands
of
kings
he
hath
chastened
his
people
with
stripes
and
scourges
our
backs
hath
he
burdened
with
grievous
weights
but
his
children
shall
rise
as
a
sea
that
surges
and
flood
the
fields
of
the
men
he
hates
the
kings
of
the
nations
our
lord
hath
smitten
his
shoe
hath
he
cast
o
er
the
gods
of
them
but
a
lamp
for
our
feet
the
lord
hath
litten
wonders
hath
he
wrought
in
the
land
of
khem
thus
they
sang
and
the
singing
was
so
wild
that
the
wanderer
craved
leave
to
go
and
stand
at
the
palace
gate
lest
the
apura
should
rush
in
and
spoil
the
the
king
nodded
but
meriamun
rose
and
went
with
the
wanderer
as
he
took
his
bow
and
passed
to
the
great
gates
there
they
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
gates
and
this
is
what
they
beheld
a
great
light
of
many
torches
was
flaring
along
the
roadway
in
front
then
came
a
body
of
men
rudely
armed
with
pikes
and
the
torchlight
shone
on
the
glitter
of
bronze
and
on
the
gold
helms
of
which
they
had
spoiled
the
soldiers
of
khem
next
came
a
troop
of
wild
women
dancing
and
beating
timbrels
and
singing
the
triumphant
hymn
of
scorn
next
with
a
space
between
tramped
eight
strong
men
bearing
on
their
shoulders
a
great
gilded
coffin
covered
with
carven
and
painted
signs
it
is
the
body
of
their
prophet
who
brought
them
hither
out
of
their
land
of
hunger
whispered
meriamun
slaves
ye
shall
hunger
yet
in
the
wilderness
and
clamour
for
the
of
khem
then
she
cried
in
a
loud
voice
for
her
passion
overcame
her
and
she
prophesied
to
those
who
bare
the
coffin
not
one
soul
of
you
that
lives
shall
see
the
land
where
your
conjurer
is
leading
you
ye
shall
thirst
ye
shall
hunger
ye
shall
call
on
the
gods
of
khem
and
they
shall
not
hear
you
ye
shall
die
and
your
bones
shall
whiten
the
wilderness
farewell
set
go
with
you
farewell
so
she
cried
and
pointed
down
the
way
and
so
fierce
was
her
gaze
and
so
awful
were
her
words
that
the
people
of
the
apura
trembled
and
the
women
ceased
to
sing
the
wanderer
watched
the
queen
and
marvelled
never
had
woman
such
a
hardy
heart
he
mused
and
it
were
ill
to
cross
her
in
love
or
war
they
will
sing
no
more
at
my
gates
murmured
meriamun
with
a
smile
come
wanderer
they
await
us
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
that
he
might
lead
her
so
they
went
back
to
the
banquet
hall
they
hearkened
as
they
sat
till
far
in
the
night
and
still
the
apura
passed
countless
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
at
length
all
were
gone
and
the
sound
of
their
feet
died
away
in
the
distance
then
meriamun
the
queen
turned
to
pharaoh
and
spake
bitterly
thou
art
a
coward
meneptah
ay
a
coward
and
a
slave
at
heart
in
thy
fear
of
the
curse
that
the
false
hathor
hath
laid
on
us
she
whom
thou
dost
worship
to
thy
shame
thou
hast
let
these
slaves
go
otherwise
had
our
father
dealt
with
them
great
rameses
miamun
the
hammer
of
the
khita
now
they
are
gone
hissing
curses
on
the
land
that
bare
them
and
robbing
those
who
nursed
them
up
while
they
were
yet
a
little
people
as
a
mother
nurses
her
what
then
might
i
do
said
pharaoh
there
is
nought
to
do
all
is
done
answered
meriamun
what
is
thy
counsel
wanderer
it
is
ill
for
a
stranger
to
offer
counsel
said
the
wanderer
nay
speak
cried
the
queen
i
know
not
the
gods
of
this
land
he
answered
if
these
people
be
favoured
of
the
gods
i
say
sit
still
but
if
not
then
said
the
wanderer
wise
in
war
let
pharaoh
gather
his
host
follow
after
the
people
take
them
unawares
and
smite
them
utterly
it
is
no
hard
task
they
are
so
mixed
a
multitude
and
cumbered
with
much
baggage
this
was
to
speak
as
the
queen
loved
to
hear
now
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
listen
listen
to
good
counsel
and
now
that
the
apura
were
gone
his
fear
of
them
went
also
and
as
he
drank
wine
pharaoh
grew
bold
till
at
last
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
swore
by
amen
by
osiris
by
ptah
and
by
his
father
great
rameses
that
he
would
follow
after
the
apura
and
smite
them
and
instantly
he
sent
forth
messengers
to
summon
the
captains
of
his
host
in
the
hall
of
assembly
thither
the
captains
came
and
their
plans
were
made
and
messengers
hurried
forth
to
the
governors
of
other
great
cities
bidding
them
send
troops
to
join
the
host
of
pharaoh
on
its
march
now
pharaoh
turned
to
the
wanderer
and
said
thou
hast
not
yet
answered
my
message
that
rei
carried
to
thee
this
morning
wilt
thou
take
service
with
me
and
be
a
captain
in
this
war
the
wanderer
little
liked
the
name
of
service
but
his
warlike
heart
was
stirred
within
him
for
he
loved
the
delight
of
battle
but
before
he
could
answer
yea
or
nay
meriamun
the
queen
who
was
not
minded
that
he
should
leave
her
spoke
hastily
this
is
my
counsel
meneptah
that
the
lord
eperitus
should
abide
here
in
tanis
and
be
the
captain
of
my
guard
while
thou
art
gone
to
smite
the
apura
for
i
may
not
be
here
unguarded
in
these
troublous
times
and
if
i
know
he
watches
over
me
he
who
is
so
mighty
a
man
then
i
shall
walk
safely
and
sleep
in
now
the
wanderer
bethought
him
of
his
desire
to
look
upon
the
hathor
for
to
see
new
things
and
try
new
adventures
was
always
his
delight
so
he
answered
that
if
it
were
pleasing
to
pharaoh
and
the
queen
he
would
willingly
stay
and
command
the
guard
and
pharaoh
said
that
it
should
be
so
iv
the
queen
s
chamber
at
midday
on
the
morrow
pharaoh
and
the
host
of
pharaoh
marched
in
pomp
from
tanis
taking
the
road
that
runs
across
the
desert
country
towards
the
red
sea
of
weeds
the
way
that
the
apura
had
gone
the
wanderer
went
with
the
army
for
an
hour
s
journey
and
more
in
a
chariot
driven
by
rei
the
priest
for
rei
did
not
march
with
the
host
the
number
of
the
soldiers
of
pharaoh
amazed
the
achæan
accustomed
to
the
levies
of
barren
isles
and
scattered
tribes
but
he
said
nothing
of
his
wonder
to
rei
or
any
man
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
he
came
from
among
a
little
people
he
even
made
as
if
he
held
the
army
lightly
and
asked
the
priest
if
this
was
all
the
strength
of
pharaoh
then
rei
told
him
that
it
was
but
a
fourth
part
for
none
of
the
mercenaries
and
none
of
the
soldiers
from
the
upper
land
marched
with
the
king
in
pursuit
of
the
apura
then
the
wanderer
knew
that
he
was
come
among
a
greater
people
than
he
had
ever
encountered
yet
on
land
or
sea
so
he
went
with
them
till
the
roads
divided
and
there
he
drove
his
chariot
to
the
chariot
of
pharaoh
and
bade
him
farewell
pharaoh
called
to
him
to
mount
his
own
chariot
and
spake
thus
to
him
swear
to
me
thou
wanderer
who
namest
thyself
eperitus
though
of
what
country
thou
art
and
what
was
thy
father
s
house
none
know
swear
to
me
that
thou
wilt
guard
meriamun
the
queen
faithfully
and
wilt
work
no
woe
upon
me
nor
open
my
house
while
i
am
afar
great
thou
art
and
beautiful
to
look
on
ay
and
strong
enough
beyond
the
strength
of
men
yet
my
heart
misdoubts
me
of
thee
for
methinks
thou
art
a
crafty
man
and
that
evil
will
come
upon
me
through
if
this
be
thy
mind
pharaoh
said
the
wanderer
leave
me
not
in
guard
of
the
queen
and
yet
methinks
i
did
not
befriend
thee
so
ill
two
nights
gone
when
the
rabble
would
have
put
thee
and
all
thy
house
to
the
sword
because
of
the
death
of
the
now
pharaoh
looked
on
him
long
and
doubtfully
then
stretched
out
his
hand
the
wanderer
took
it
and
swore
by
his
own
gods
by
zeus
by
aphrodite
and
athene
and
apollo
that
he
would
be
true
to
the
trust
i
believe
thee
wanderer
said
pharaoh
know
this
if
thou
keepest
thine
oath
thou
shalt
have
great
rewards
and
thou
shalt
be
second
to
none
in
the
land
of
khem
but
if
thou
failest
then
thou
shalt
die
i
ask
no
fee
answered
the
wanderer
and
i
fear
no
death
for
in
one
way
only
shall
i
die
and
that
is
known
to
me
yet
i
will
keep
my
and
he
bowed
before
pharaoh
and
leaping
from
his
chariot
entered
again
into
the
chariot
of
rei
now
as
he
drove
back
through
the
host
the
soldiers
called
to
him
saying
leave
us
not
for
he
looked
so
glorious
in
his
golden
armour
that
it
seemed
to
them
as
though
a
god
departed
from
their
ranks
his
heart
was
with
them
for
he
loved
war
and
he
did
not
love
the
apura
but
he
drove
on
as
so
it
must
be
and
came
to
the
palace
at
sundown
that
night
he
sat
at
the
feast
by
the
side
of
meriamun
the
queen
and
when
the
feast
was
done
she
bade
him
follow
her
into
her
chamber
where
she
sat
when
she
would
be
alone
it
was
a
fragrant
chamber
dimly
lighted
with
lamps
furnished
with
couches
of
ivory
and
gold
while
all
the
walls
told
painted
stories
of
strange
gods
and
kings
and
of
their
loves
and
wars
the
queen
sank
back
upon
the
embroidered
cushions
of
a
couch
and
bade
the
wise
odysseus
to
sit
guard
over
against
her
so
near
that
her
robes
swept
his
golden
greaves
this
he
did
somewhat
against
his
will
though
he
was
no
hater
of
fair
women
but
his
heart
misdoubted
the
queen
and
he
looked
upon
her
guardedly
for
she
was
strangely
fair
to
see
the
fairest
of
all
mortal
women
whom
he
had
known
save
the
golden
helen
wanderer
we
owe
thee
great
thanks
and
i
would
gladly
know
to
whom
we
are
in
debt
for
the
prices
of
our
lives
she
said
tell
me
of
thy
birth
of
thy
father
s
house
and
of
the
lands
that
thou
hast
seen
and
the
wars
wherein
thou
hast
fought
tell
me
also
of
the
sack
of
ilios
and
how
thou
camest
by
thy
golden
mail
the
unhappy
paris
wore
such
arms
as
these
if
the
minstrel
of
the
north
sang
now
the
wanderer
would
gladly
have
cursed
this
minstrel
of
the
north
and
his
songs
minstrels
will
be
lying
lady
he
said
and
they
gather
old
tales
wherever
they
go
paris
may
have
worn
my
arms
or
another
man
i
bought
them
from
a
chapman
in
crete
and
asked
nothing
of
their
first
master
as
for
ilios
i
fought
there
in
my
youth
and
served
the
cretan
idomeneus
but
i
got
little
booty
to
the
king
the
wealth
and
women
to
us
the
such
is
the
appearance
of
meriamun
listened
to
his
tale
which
he
set
forth
roughly
as
if
he
were
some
blunt
grumbling
swordsman
and
darkly
she
looked
on
him
while
she
hearkened
and
darkly
she
smiled
as
she
looked
a
strange
story
eperitus
a
strange
story
truly
now
tell
me
thus
how
camest
thou
by
yonder
great
bow
the
bow
of
the
swallow
string
if
my
minstrel
spoke
truly
it
was
once
the
bow
of
eurytus
of
now
the
wanderer
glanced
round
him
like
a
man
taken
in
ambush
who
sees
on
every
hand
the
sword
of
foes
shine
up
into
the
sunlight
the
bow
lady
he
answered
readily
enough
i
got
it
strangely
i
was
cruising
with
a
cargo
of
iron
on
the
western
coast
and
landed
on
an
isle
methinks
the
pilot
called
it
ithaca
there
we
found
nothing
but
death
a
pestilence
had
been
in
the
land
but
in
a
ruined
hall
this
bow
was
lying
and
i
made
prize
of
it
a
good
bow
a
strange
story
truly
a
very
strange
story
quoth
meriamun
the
queen
by
chance
thou
didst
buy
the
armour
of
paris
by
chance
thou
didst
find
the
bow
of
eurytus
that
bow
methinks
with
which
the
odysseus
slew
the
wooers
in
his
halls
knowest
thou
eperitus
that
when
thou
stoodest
yonder
on
the
board
in
the
place
of
banquets
when
the
great
bow
twanged
and
the
long
shafts
hailed
down
on
the
hall
and
loosened
the
knees
of
many
not
a
little
was
i
put
in
mind
of
the
song
of
the
slaying
of
the
wooers
at
the
hands
of
odysseus
the
fame
of
odysseus
has
wandered
far
ay
even
to
and
she
looked
straight
at
him
the
wanderer
darkened
his
face
and
put
the
matter
by
he
had
heard
something
of
that
tale
he
said
but
deemed
it
a
minstrel
s
feigning
one
man
could
not
fight
a
hundred
as
the
story
went
the
queen
half
rose
from
the
couch
where
she
lay
curled
up
like
a
glittering
snake
like
a
snake
she
rose
and
watched
him
with
her
melancholy
eyes
strange
indeed
most
strange
that
odysseus
laertes
son
odysseus
of
ithaca
should
not
know
the
tale
of
the
slaying
of
the
wooers
by
odysseus
self
strange
indeed
thou
eperitus
who
art
now
the
neck
of
the
wanderer
was
in
the
noose
and
well
he
knew
it
yet
he
kept
his
counsel
and
looked
upon
her
vacantly
men
say
that
this
odysseus
wandered
years
ago
into
the
north
and
that
this
time
he
will
not
come
again
i
saw
him
in
the
wars
and
he
was
a
taller
man
than
i
said
the
wanderer
i
have
always
heard
said
the
queen
that
odysseus
was
and
crafty
as
a
fox
look
me
in
the
eyes
thou
wanderer
look
me
in
the
eyes
and
i
will
show
thee
whether
or
not
thou
art
odysseus
and
she
leaned
forward
so
that
her
hair
swept
his
brow
and
gazed
deep
into
his
eyes
now
the
wanderer
was
ashamed
to
drop
his
eyes
before
a
woman
s
and
he
could
not
rise
and
go
so
he
must
needs
gaze
and
as
he
gazed
his
head
grew
strangely
light
and
the
blood
quivered
in
his
veins
and
then
seemed
to
stop
now
turn
thou
wanderer
said
the
voice
of
the
queen
and
to
him
it
sounded
far
away
as
if
there
was
a
wall
between
them
and
tell
me
what
thou
so
he
turned
and
looked
towards
the
dark
end
of
the
chamber
but
presently
through
the
darkness
stole
a
faint
light
like
the
first
grey
light
of
the
dawn
and
now
he
saw
a
shape
like
the
shape
of
a
great
horse
of
wood
and
behind
the
horse
were
black
square
towers
of
huge
stones
and
gates
and
walls
and
houses
now
he
saw
a
door
open
in
the
side
of
the
horse
and
the
helmeted
head
of
a
man
look
out
wearily
as
he
looked
a
great
white
star
slid
down
the
sky
so
that
the
light
of
it
rested
on
the
face
of
the
man
and
that
face
was
his
own
then
he
remembered
how
he
had
looked
forth
from
the
belly
of
the
wooden
horse
as
it
stood
within
the
walls
of
ilios
and
thus
the
star
had
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
doomed
city
an
omen
of
the
end
of
troy
look
again
said
the
voice
of
meriamun
from
far
away
so
once
more
he
looked
into
the
darkness
and
there
he
saw
the
mouth
of
a
cave
and
beneath
two
palms
in
front
of
it
sat
a
man
and
a
woman
the
yellow
moon
rose
and
its
light
fell
upon
a
sleeping
sea
upon
tall
trees
upon
the
cave
and
the
two
who
sat
there
the
woman
was
lovely
with
braided
hair
and
clad
in
a
shining
robe
and
her
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
that
she
might
never
shed
for
she
was
a
goddess
calypso
the
daughter
of
atlas
then
in
the
vision
the
man
looked
up
and
his
face
was
weary
and
worn
and
sick
for
home
but
it
was
his
own
face
then
he
remembered
how
he
had
sat
thus
at
the
side
of
calypso
of
the
braided
tresses
on
that
last
night
of
all
his
nights
in
her
isle
the
centre
of
the
seas
look
once
more
said
the
voice
of
meriamun
the
queen
again
he
looked
into
the
darkness
there
before
him
grew
the
ruins
of
his
own
hall
in
ithaca
and
in
the
courtyard
before
the
hall
was
a
heap
of
ashes
and
the
charred
bones
of
men
before
the
heap
lay
the
figure
of
one
lost
in
sorrow
for
his
limbs
writhed
upon
the
ground
anon
the
man
lifted
his
face
and
behold
the
wanderer
knew
that
it
was
his
own
face
then
of
a
sudden
the
gloom
passed
away
from
the
chamber
and
once
more
his
blood
surged
through
his
veins
and
there
before
him
sat
meriamun
the
queen
smiling
darkly
strange
sights
hast
thou
seen
is
it
not
so
wanderer
she
said
yea
queen
the
most
strange
of
sights
tell
me
of
thy
courtesy
how
thou
didst
conjure
them
before
my
by
the
magic
that
i
have
eperitus
i
above
all
wizards
who
dwell
in
khem
the
magic
whereby
i
can
read
all
the
past
of
those
i
love
and
again
she
looked
upon
him
ay
and
call
it
forth
from
the
storehouse
of
dead
time
and
make
it
live
again
say
whose
face
was
it
that
thou
didst
look
upon
was
it
not
the
face
of
odysseus
of
ithaca
laertes
son
and
was
not
that
face
thine
now
the
wanderer
saw
that
there
was
no
escape
therefore
he
spoke
the
truth
not
because
he
loved
it
but
because
he
must
the
face
of
odysseus
of
ithaca
it
was
that
i
saw
before
me
lady
and
that
face
is
mine
i
avow
myself
to
be
odysseus
laertes
son
and
no
other
the
queen
laughed
aloud
great
must
be
my
strength
of
magic
she
said
for
it
can
strip
the
guile
from
the
subtlest
of
men
henceforth
odysseus
thou
wilt
know
that
the
eyes
of
meriamun
the
queen
see
far
now
tell
me
truly
what
camest
thou
hither
to
seek
the
wanderer
took
swift
counsel
with
himself
remembering
that
dream
of
meriamun
of
which
rei
the
priest
had
told
him
and
which
she
knew
not
that
he
had
learned
the
dream
that
showed
her
the
vision
of
one
whom
she
must
love
and
remembering
the
word
of
the
dead
hataska
he
grew
afraid
for
he
saw
well
by
the
token
of
the
spear
point
that
he
was
the
man
of
her
dream
and
that
she
knew
it
but
he
could
not
accept
her
love
both
because
of
his
oath
to
pharaoh
and
because
of
her
whom
aphrodite
had
shown
to
him
in
ithaca
her
whom
alone
he
must
seek
the
heart
s
desire
the
golden
helen
the
strait
was
desperate
between
a
broken
oath
and
a
woman
scorned
but
he
feared
his
oath
and
the
anger
of
zeus
the
god
of
hosts
and
guests
so
he
sought
safety
beneath
the
wings
of
truth
lady
he
said
i
will
tell
thee
all
i
came
to
ithaca
from
the
white
north
where
a
curse
had
driven
me
i
came
and
found
my
halls
desolate
and
my
people
dead
and
the
very
ashes
of
my
wife
but
in
a
dream
of
the
night
i
saw
the
goddess
whom
i
have
worshipped
little
aphrodite
of
idalia
whom
in
this
land
ye
name
hathor
and
she
bade
me
go
forth
and
do
her
will
and
for
reward
she
promised
me
that
i
should
find
one
who
waited
me
to
be
my
deathless
meriamun
heard
him
so
far
but
no
further
for
of
this
she
made
sure
that
was
the
woman
whom
aphrodite
had
promised
to
the
wanderer
ere
he
might
speak
another
word
she
glided
to
him
like
a
snake
and
like
a
snake
curled
herself
about
him
then
she
spoke
so
low
that
he
rather
knew
her
thought
than
heard
her
words
was
it
indeed
so
odysseus
did
the
goddess
indeed
send
thee
to
seek
me
out
know
then
that
not
to
thee
alone
did
she
speak
i
also
looked
for
thee
i
also
waited
the
coming
of
one
whom
i
should
love
oh
heavy
have
been
the
days
and
empty
was
my
heart
and
sorely
through
the
years
have
i
longed
for
him
who
should
be
brought
to
me
and
now
at
length
it
is
done
now
at
length
i
see
him
whom
in
my
dream
i
saw
and
she
lifted
her
lips
to
the
lips
of
the
wanderer
and
her
heart
and
her
eyes
and
her
lips
said
but
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
bore
a
stout
and
patient
heart
and
a
brain
unclouded
by
danger
or
by
love
he
had
never
been
in
a
strait
like
this
caught
with
bonds
that
no
sword
could
cut
and
in
toils
that
no
skill
could
undo
on
one
side
were
love
and
pleasure
on
the
other
a
broken
oath
and
the
loss
for
ever
of
the
heart
s
desire
for
to
love
another
woman
as
he
had
been
warned
was
to
lose
helen
but
again
if
he
scorned
the
queen
nay
for
all
his
hardihood
he
dared
not
tell
her
that
she
was
not
the
woman
of
his
vision
the
woman
he
came
to
seek
yet
even
now
his
cold
courage
and
his
cunning
did
not
fail
him
lady
he
said
we
both
have
dreamed
but
if
thou
didst
dream
thou
wert
my
love
thou
didst
wake
to
find
thyself
the
wife
of
pharaoh
and
pharaoh
is
my
host
and
hath
my
i
woke
to
find
myself
the
wife
of
pharaoh
she
echoed
wearily
and
her
arms
uncurled
from
his
neck
and
she
sank
back
on
the
couch
i
am
pharaoh
s
wife
in
word
but
not
in
deed
pharaoh
is
nothing
to
me
thou
wanderer
nought
save
a
yet
is
my
oath
much
to
me
queen
meriamun
my
oath
and
the
hospitable
hearth
the
wanderer
made
answer
i
swore
to
meneptah
to
hold
thee
from
all
ill
and
there
s
an
and
if
pharaoh
comes
back
no
more
what
then
odysseus
then
will
we
talk
again
and
now
lady
thy
safety
calls
me
to
visit
thy
and
without
more
words
he
rose
and
went
the
queen
looked
after
him
a
strange
man
she
said
in
her
heart
who
builds
a
barrier
with
his
oath
betwixt
himself
and
her
he
loves
and
has
wandered
so
far
to
win
yet
methinks
i
honour
him
the
more
pharaoh
meneptah
my
husband
eat
drink
and
be
merry
for
this
i
promise
thee
short
shall
be
thy
v
the
chapel
perilous
swift
as
a
bird
or
a
thought
says
the
old
harper
of
the
northern
sea
the
wanderer
s
thoughts
in
the
morning
were
swift
as
night
birds
flying
back
and
brooding
over
the
things
he
had
seen
and
the
words
he
had
heard
in
the
queen
s
chamber
again
he
stood
between
this
woman
and
the
oath
which
of
all
oaths
was
the
worst
to
break
and
indeed
he
was
little
tempted
to
break
it
for
though
meriamun
was
beautiful
and
wise
he
feared
her
love
and
he
feared
her
magic
art
no
less
than
he
feared
her
vengeance
if
she
were
scorned
delay
seemed
the
only
course
let
him
wait
till
the
king
returned
and
it
would
go
hard
but
he
found
some
cause
for
leaving
the
city
of
tanis
and
seeking
through
new
adventures
the
world
s
desire
the
mysterious
river
lay
yonder
he
would
ascend
the
river
of
which
so
many
tales
were
told
it
flowed
from
the
land
of
the
blameless
the
most
just
of
men
at
whose
tables
the
very
gods
sat
as
guests
there
perchance
far
up
the
sacred
stream
in
a
land
where
no
wrong
ever
came
there
if
the
fates
permitted
he
might
find
the
golden
helen
if
the
fates
permitted
but
all
the
adventure
was
of
the
fates
who
had
shown
him
to
meriamun
in
a
dream
he
turned
it
long
in
his
mind
and
found
little
light
it
seemed
that
as
he
had
drifted
through
darkness
across
a
sea
to
the
shores
of
khem
so
he
should
wade
through
blood
to
that
shore
of
fate
which
the
gods
appointed
yet
after
a
while
he
shook
sorrow
from
him
arose
bathed
anointed
himself
combed
his
dark
locks
and
girded
on
his
golden
armour
for
now
he
remembered
that
this
was
the
day
when
the
strange
hathor
should
stand
upon
the
pylon
of
the
temple
and
call
the
people
to
her
and
he
was
minded
to
look
upon
her
and
if
need
be
to
do
battle
with
that
which
guarded
her
so
he
prayed
to
aphrodite
that
she
would
help
him
and
he
poured
out
wine
to
her
and
waited
he
waited
but
no
answer
came
to
his
prayer
yet
as
he
turned
away
it
chanced
that
he
saw
his
countenance
in
the
wide
golden
cup
whence
he
had
poured
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
had
grown
more
fair
and
lost
the
stamp
of
years
and
that
his
face
was
smooth
and
young
as
the
face
of
that
odysseus
who
many
years
ago
had
sailed
in
the
black
ships
and
looked
back
on
the
smoking
ruins
of
windy
troy
in
this
he
saw
the
hand
of
the
goddess
and
knew
that
if
she
might
not
be
manifest
in
this
land
of
strange
gods
yet
she
was
with
him
and
knowing
this
his
heart
grew
light
as
the
heart
of
a
boy
from
whom
sorrow
is
yet
a
long
way
off
and
who
has
not
dreamed
of
death
then
he
ate
and
drank
and
when
he
had
put
from
him
the
desire
of
food
he
arose
and
girded
on
the
sword
euryalus
s
gift
but
the
black
bow
he
left
in
its
case
now
he
was
ready
and
about
to
set
forth
when
rei
the
priest
entered
the
chamber
whither
goest
thou
eperitus
asked
rei
the
instructed
priest
and
what
is
it
that
has
made
thy
face
so
fair
as
though
many
years
had
been
lifted
from
thy
back
tis
but
sweet
sleep
rei
said
the
wanderer
deeply
i
slept
last
night
and
the
weariness
of
my
wanderings
fell
from
me
and
now
i
am
as
i
was
before
i
sailed
across
the
sea
into
the
sell
thou
the
secret
of
this
sleep
to
the
ladies
of
khem
answered
the
aged
priest
smiling
and
little
shalt
thou
lack
of
wealth
for
all
thy
thus
he
spake
as
though
he
believed
the
wanderer
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
the
thing
was
of
the
gods
the
wanderer
answered
i
go
up
to
the
temple
of
the
hathor
for
thou
dost
remember
it
is
that
she
stands
upon
the
pylon
brow
and
calls
the
people
to
her
comest
thou
also
rei
nay
nay
i
come
not
eperitus
i
am
old
indeed
but
yet
the
blood
creeps
through
these
withered
veins
and
perchance
if
i
came
and
looked
the
madness
would
seize
me
also
and
i
too
should
rush
to
my
slaying
there
is
a
way
in
which
a
man
may
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
hathor
and
that
is
to
have
his
eyes
blindfolded
as
many
do
but
even
then
he
will
tear
the
bandage
from
his
eyes
and
look
and
die
with
the
others
oh
go
not
up
eperitus
i
pray
thee
go
not
up
i
love
thee
i
know
not
why
and
am
little
minded
to
see
thee
dead
though
perchance
he
added
as
though
to
himself
it
would
be
well
for
those
i
serve
if
thou
wert
dead
thou
wanderer
with
the
eyes
of
have
no
fear
rei
said
the
wanderer
as
it
is
doomed
so
shall
i
die
and
not
otherwise
never
shall
it
be
told
he
murmured
in
his
heart
that
he
who
stood
in
arms
against
scylla
the
horror
of
the
rock
turned
back
from
any
form
of
fear
or
from
any
shape
of
then
rei
wrung
his
hands
and
went
nigh
to
weeping
for
to
him
it
seemed
a
pitiful
thing
that
so
goodly
a
man
and
so
great
a
hero
should
thus
be
done
to
death
but
the
wanderer
passed
out
through
the
city
and
rei
went
with
him
for
a
certain
distance
at
length
they
came
to
the
road
set
on
either
side
with
sphinxes
that
leads
from
the
outer
wall
of
brick
to
the
garden
of
the
temple
of
hathor
and
down
this
road
hurried
a
multitude
of
men
of
all
races
and
of
every
age
here
the
prince
was
borne
along
in
his
litter
here
the
young
noble
travelled
in
his
chariot
here
came
the
slave
bespattered
with
the
mud
of
the
fields
here
the
cripple
limped
upon
his
crutches
and
here
was
the
blind
man
led
by
a
hound
and
with
each
man
came
women
the
wife
of
the
man
or
his
mother
or
his
sisters
or
she
to
whom
he
was
vowed
in
marriage
weeping
they
came
and
with
soft
words
and
clinging
arms
they
strove
to
hold
back
him
whom
they
loved
oh
my
son
my
son
cried
a
woman
hearken
to
thy
mother
s
voice
go
not
up
to
look
upon
the
goddess
for
if
thou
dost
look
then
shalt
thou
die
and
thou
alone
art
left
alive
to
me
two
brothers
of
thine
i
bore
and
behold
both
are
dead
and
wilt
thou
die
also
and
leave
me
who
am
old
alone
and
desolate
be
not
mad
my
son
thou
art
the
dearest
of
all
ever
have
i
loved
thee
and
tended
thee
come
back
i
pray
come
but
her
son
heard
not
and
heeded
not
pressing
on
toward
the
gates
of
the
heart
s
desire
oh
my
husband
my
husband
cried
another
young
of
gentle
birth
and
fair
who
bare
a
babe
on
her
left
arm
and
with
the
right
clutched
her
lord
s
broidered
robe
oh
my
husband
have
i
not
loved
thee
and
been
kind
to
thee
and
wilt
thou
still
go
up
to
look
upon
the
deadly
glory
of
the
hathor
they
say
she
wears
the
beauty
of
the
dead
lovest
thou
me
not
better
than
her
who
died
five
years
agone
merisa
the
daughter
of
rois
though
thou
didst
love
her
first
see
here
is
thy
babe
thy
babe
but
one
week
born
even
from
my
bed
of
pain
have
i
risen
and
followed
after
thee
down
these
weary
roads
and
i
am
like
to
lose
my
life
for
it
here
is
thy
babe
let
it
plead
with
thee
let
me
die
if
so
it
must
be
but
go
not
thou
up
to
thy
death
it
is
no
goddess
whom
thou
wilt
see
but
an
evil
spirit
loosed
from
the
and
that
shall
be
thy
doom
oh
if
i
please
thee
not
take
thou
another
wife
and
i
will
make
her
welcome
only
go
not
up
to
thy
death
but
the
man
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
pylon
tops
heeding
her
not
and
at
length
she
sank
upon
the
road
and
there
with
the
babe
would
have
been
crushed
by
the
chariots
had
not
the
wanderer
borne
her
to
one
side
of
the
way
now
of
all
sights
this
was
the
most
dreadful
for
on
every
side
rose
the
prayers
and
lamentations
of
women
and
still
the
multitude
of
men
pressed
on
unheeding
now
thou
seest
the
power
of
love
and
how
if
a
woman
be
but
beautiful
enough
she
may
drag
all
men
to
ruin
said
rei
the
priest
yes
said
the
wanderer
a
strange
sight
truly
much
blood
hath
this
hathor
of
thine
upon
her
and
yet
thou
wilt
give
her
thine
that
i
am
not
minded
to
do
he
answered
yet
i
will
look
upon
her
face
so
speak
no
more
of
now
they
were
come
to
the
space
before
the
bronze
gates
of
the
pylon
of
the
outer
court
and
there
the
multitude
gathered
to
the
number
of
many
hundreds
presently
as
they
watched
a
priest
came
to
the
gates
that
same
priest
who
had
shown
the
wanderer
the
bodies
in
the
baths
of
bronze
he
looked
through
the
bars
and
cried
aloud
whoso
would
enter
into
the
court
and
look
upon
the
holy
hathor
let
him
draw

know
ye
this
all
men
the
hathor
is
to
him
who
can
win
her
but
if
he
pass
not
then
shall
he
die
and
be
buried
within
the
temple
nor
shall
he
ever
look
upon
the
sun
again
of
this
ye
are
warned
since
the
hathor
came
again
to
khem
of
men
seven
hundred
and
three
have
gone
to
win
her
and
of
bodies
seven
hundred
and
two
lie
within
the
vaults
for
of
all
these
men
pharaoh
meneptah
alone
hath
gone
back
living
yet
there
is
place
for
more
enter
ye
who
would
look
upon
the
hathor
now
there
arose
a
mighty
wailing
from
the
women
they
clung
madly
about
the
necks
of
those
who
were
dear
to
them
and
some
clung
not
in
vain
for
the
hearts
of
many
failed
them
at
the
last
and
they
shrank
from
entering
in
but
a
few
of
those
who
had
already
looked
upon
the
hathor
from
afar
perchance
a
score
in
all
struck
the
women
from
them
and
rushed
up
to
the
gates
surely
thou
wilt
not
enter
in
quoth
rei
clinging
to
the
arm
of
the
wanderer
oh
turn
thy
back
on
death
and
come
back
with
me
i
pray
thee
nay
said
the
wanderer
i
will
go
then
rei
the
priest
threw
dust
upon
his
head
wept
aloud
and
turned
and
fled
never
stopping
till
he
came
to
the
palace
where
sat
meriamun
the
queen
now
the
priest
unbarred
a
wicket
in
the
gates
of
bronze
and
one
by
one
those
who
were
stricken
of
the
madness
entered
in
for
all
of
these
had
seen
the
hathor
many
times
from
afar
without
the
wall
and
now
they
could
no
more
withstand
their
longing
and
as
they
entered
two
other
priests
took
them
by
the
hand
and
bound
their
eyes
with
cloths
so
that
unless
they
willed
it
they
might
not
see
the
glory
of
the
hathor
but
only
hear
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
but
two
there
were
who
would
not
be
blindfolded
and
of
these
one
was
that
man
whose
wife
had
fainted
by
the
way
and
the
other
was
a
man
sightless
from
his
youth
for
although
he
might
not
see
the
beauty
of
the
goddess
this
man
was
made
mad
by
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
now
when
all
had
entered
in
save
the
wanderer
there
was
a
stir
in
the
crowd
and
a
man
rushed
up
he
was
he
had
a
black
beard
black
eyes
and
a
nose
hooked
like
a
vulture
s
beak
hold
he
cried
hold
shut
not
the
gates
night
and
day
have
i
journeyed
from
the
host
of
the
apura
who
fly
into
the
wilderness
night
and
day
have
i
journeyed
leaving
wife
and
flocks
and
children
and
the
promise
of
the
land
that
i
may
once
more
look
upon
the
beauty
of
the
hathor
shut
not
the
gates
pass
in
said
the
priest
pass
in
so
shall
we
be
rid
of
one
of
those
whom
khem
nurtured
up
to
rob
he
entered
then
as
the
priest
was
about
to
bar
the
wicket
the
wanderer
strode
forward
and
his
golden
armour
clashed
beneath
the
portal
wouldst
thou
indeed
enter
to
thy
doom
thou
mighty
lord
asked
the
priest
for
he
knew
him
well
again
ay
i
enter
but
perchance
not
to
my
doom
answered
the
wanderer
then
he
passed
in
and
the
brazen
gate
was
shut
behind
him
now
the
two
priests
came
forward
to
bind
his
eyes
but
this
he
would
not
endure
not
so
he
said
i
am
come
here
to
see
what
may
be
go
to
thou
madman
go
to
and
die
the
death
they
answered
and
led
all
the
men
to
the
centre
of
the
courtyard
whence
they
might
see
the
pylon
top
then
the
priests
also
covered
up
their
eyes
and
cast
themselves
at
length
upon
the
ground
so
for
a
while
they
lay
and
all
was
silence
within
and
without
the
court
for
they
waited
the
coming
of
the
hathor
the
wanderer
glanced
through
the
bars
of
bronze
at
the
multitude
gathered
there
silent
they
stood
with
upturned
eyes
even
the
women
had
ceased
from
weeping
and
stood
in
silence
he
looked
at
those
beside
him
their
bandaged
faces
were
lifted
and
they
stared
towards
the
pylon
top
as
though
their
vision
pierced
the
cloths
the
blind
man
too
stared
upward
and
his
pale
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
now
at
the
foot
of
the
pylon
lay
a
little
rim
of
shadow
thinner
and
thinner
it
grew
as
the
moments
crept
on
towards
the
perfect
noon
now
there
was
but
a
line
and
now
the
line
was
gone
for
the
sun
s
red
disc
burned
high
in
the
blue
heaven
straight
above
the
pylon
brow
then
suddenly
and
from
afar
there
came
a
faint
sweet
sound
of
singing
and
at
the
first
note
of
the
sound
a
great
sigh
went
up
through
the
quiet
air
from
all
the
multitude
without
those
who
were
near
the
wanderer
sighed
also
and
their
lips
and
fingers
twitched
and
he
himself
sighed
though
he
knew
not
why
nearer
came
the
sweet
sound
of
singing
and
stronger
it
swelled
till
presently
those
without
the
temple
gate
who
were
on
higher
ground
caught
sight
of
her
who
sang
then
a
hoarse
roar
went
up
from
every
throat
and
madness
took
them
on
they
rushed
dashing
themselves
against
the
gates
of
bronze
and
the
steep
walls
on
either
side
and
beat
upon
them
madly
with
their
fists
and
brows
and
climbed
on
each
other
s
shoulders
gnawing
at
the
bars
with
their
teeth
crying
to
be
let
in
but
the
women
threw
their
arms
about
them
and
screamed
curses
on
her
whose
beauty
brought
all
men
to
madness
so
it
went
for
a
while
till
presently
the
wanderer
looked
up
and
lo
upon
the
pylon
s
brow
stood
the
woman
s
self
and
at
her
coming
all
were
once
more
silent
she
was
tall
and
straight
clad
in
clinging
white
but
on
her
breast
there
glowed
a
ruby
stone
fashioned
like
a
star
and
from
it
fell
red
drops
that
stained
for
one
moment
the
whiteness
of
her
robes
and
then
the
robe
was
white
again
her
golden
hair
was
tossed
this
way
and
that
and
shone
in
the
sunlight
her
arms
and
neck
were
bare
and
she
held
one
hand
before
her
eyes
as
though
to
hide
the
brightness
of
her
beauty
for
indeed
she
could
not
be
called
beautiful
but
beauty
itself
and
they
who
had
not
loved
saw
in
her
that
first
love
whom
no
man
has
ever
won
and
they
who
had
loved
saw
that
first
love
whom
every
man
has
lost
and
all
about
her
rolled
a
glory
like
the
glory
of
the
dying
day
sweetly
she
sang
a
song
of
promise
and
her
voice
was
the
voice
of
each
man
s
desire
and
the
heart
of
the
wanderer
thrilled
in
answer
to
it
as
thrills
a
harp
smitten
by
a
cunning
hand
and
thus
she
sang
whom
hast
thou
longed
for
most
true
love
of
mine
whom
hast
thou
loved
and
lost
lo
she
is
thine
she
that
another
wed
breaks
from
her
vow
she
that
hath
long
been
dead
wakes
for
thee
now
dreams
haunt
the
hapless
bed
ghosts
haunt
the
night
life
crowns
her
living
head
love
and
delight
nay
not
a
dream
nor
ghost
nay
but
divine
she
that
was
loved
and
lost
waits
to
be
thine
she
ceased
and
a
moan
of
desire
went
up
from
all
who
heard
then
the
wanderer
saw
that
those
beside
him
tore
at
the
bandages
about
their
brows
and
rent
them
loose
only
the
priests
who
lay
upon
the
ground
stirred
not
though
they
also
moaned
and
now
again
she
sang
still
holding
her
hand
before
her
face
ye
that
seek
me
ye
that
sue
me
ye
that
flock
beneath
my
tower
ye
would
win
me
would
undo
me
i
must
perish
in
an
hour
dead
before
the
love
that
slew
me
clasped
the
bride
and
crushed
the
flower
hear
the
word
and
mark
the
warning
beauty
lives
but
in
your
sight
beauty
fades
from
all
men
s
scorning
in
the
watches
of
the
night
beauty
wanes
before
the
morning
and
love
dies
in
his
delight
she
ceased
and
once
more
there
was
silence
then
suddenly
she
bent
forward
across
the
pylon
brow
so
far
that
it
seemed
that
she
must
fall
and
stretching
out
her
arms
as
though
to
clasp
those
beneath
showed
all
the
glory
of
her
loveliness
the
wanderer
looked
then
dropped
his
eyes
as
one
who
has
seen
the
brightness
of
the
noonday
sun
in
the
darkness
of
his
mind
the
world
was
lost
and
he
could
think
of
naught
save
the
clamour
of
the
people
which
fretted
his
ears
they
were
all
crying
and
none
were
listening
see
see
shouted
one
look
at
her
hair
it
is
dark
as
the
raven
s
wing
and
her
eyes
they
are
dark
as
night
oh
my
love
my
love
see
see
cried
another
were
ever
skies
so
blue
as
those
eyes
of
hers
was
ever
foam
so
white
as
those
white
arms
even
so
she
looked
whom
once
i
wed
many
summers
gone
murmured
a
third
even
so
when
first
i
drew
her
veil
hers
was
that
gentle
smile
breaking
like
ripples
on
the
water
hers
that
curling
hair
hers
that
was
ever
woman
so
queenly
made
said
a
fourth
look
now
on
the
brow
of
pride
look
on
the
deep
dark
eyes
of
storm
the
arched
lips
and
the
imperial
air
ah
here
indeed
is
a
goddess
meet
for
not
so
i
see
her
cried
a
fifth
that
man
who
had
come
from
the
host
of
the
apura
pale
she
is
and
fair
tall
indeed
but
delicately
shaped
brown
is
her
hair
and
brown
are
her
great
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
a
stag
and
ah
sadly
she
looks
upon
me
looking
for
my
my
eyes
are
opened
screamed
the
blind
man
at
the
wanderer
s
side
my
eyes
are
opened
and
i
see
the
pylon
tower
and
the
splendid
sun
love
hath
touched
me
on
the
eyes
and
they
are
opened
but
lo
not
one
shape
hath
she
but
many
shapes
oh
she
is
beauty
s
self
and
no
tongue
may
tell
her
glory
let
me
die
let
me
die
for
my
eyes
are
opened
i
have
looked
on
beauty
s
self
i
know
what
all
the
world
journeys
on
to
seek
and
why
we
die
and
what
we
go
to
find
in
vi
the
wardens
of
the
gate
the
clamour
swelled
or
sank
and
the
men
called
or
cried
the
names
of
many
women
some
dead
some
lost
others
were
mute
silent
in
the
presence
of
the
world
s
desire
silent
as
when
we
see
lost
faces
in
a
dream
the
wanderer
had
looked
once
and
then
cast
down
his
eyes
and
stood
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
he
alone
waited
and
strove
to
think
the
rest
were
abandoned
to
the
bewilderment
of
their
passions
and
their
amaze
what
was
it
that
he
had
seen
that
which
he
had
sought
his
whole
life
long
sought
by
sea
and
land
not
knowing
what
he
sought
for
this
he
had
wandered
with
a
hungry
heart
and
now
was
the
hunger
of
his
heart
to
be
appeased
between
him
and
her
was
the
unknown
barrier
and
the
invisible
death
was
he
to
pass
the
unmarked
boundary
to
force
those
guarded
gates
and
achieve
where
all
had
failed
had
a
magic
deceived
his
eyes
did
he
look
but
on
a
picture
and
a
vision
that
some
art
could
call
again
from
the
haunted
place
of
memory
he
sighed
and
looked
again
lo
in
his
charmed
sight
a
fair
girl
seemed
to
stand
upon
the
pylon
brow
and
on
her
head
she
bore
a
shining
urn
of
bronze
he
knew
her
now
he
had
seen
her
thus
at
the
court
of
king
tyndareus
as
he
drove
in
his
chariot
through
the
ford
of
eurotas
thus
he
had
seen
her
also
in
the
dream
on
the
silent
isle
again
he
sighed
and
again
he
looked
now
in
his
charmed
sight
a
woman
sat
whose
face
was
the
face
of
the
girl
grown
more
lovely
far
but
sad
with
grief
and
touched
with
shame
he
saw
her
and
he
knew
her
so
he
had
seen
her
in
troy
towers
when
he
stole
thither
in
a
beggar
s
guise
from
the
camp
of
the
achæans
so
he
had
seen
her
when
she
saved
his
life
in
ilios
again
he
sighed
and
again
he
looked
and
now
he
saw
the
golden
helen
she
stood
upon
the
pylon
s
brow
she
stood
with
arms
outstretched
with
eyes
upturned
and
on
her
shining
face
there
was
a
smile
like
the
infinite
smile
of
the
dawn
oh
now
indeed
he
knew
the
shape
that
was
beauty
s
self
the
innocent
spirit
of
love
sent
on
earth
by
the
undying
gods
to
be
the
doom
and
the
delight
of
men
to
draw
them
through
the
ways
of
strife
to
the
unknown
end
awhile
the
golden
helen
stood
thus
looking
up
and
out
to
the
worlds
beyond
to
the
peace
beyond
the
strife
to
the
goal
beyond
the
grave
thus
she
stood
while
men
scarce
dared
to
breathe
summoning
all
to
come
and
take
that
which
upon
the
earth
is
guarded
so
invincibly
then
once
more
she
sang
and
as
she
sang
slowly
drew
herself
away
till
at
length
nothing
was
left
of
the
vision
of
her
save
the
sweetness
of
her
dying
song
who
wins
his
love
shall
lose
her
who
loses
her
shall
gain
for
still
the
spirit
woos
her
a
soul
without
a
stain
and
memory
still
pursues
her
with
longings
not
in
vain
he
loses
her
who
gains
her
who
watches
day
by
day
the
dust
of
time
that
stains
her
the
griefs
that
leave
her
grey
the
flesh
that
yet
enchains
her
whose
grace
hath
passed
away
oh
happier
he
who
gains
not
the
love
some
seem
to
gain
the
joy
that
custom
stains
not
shall
still
with
him
remain
the
loveliness
that
wanes
not
the
love
that
ne
er
can
wane
in
dreams
she
grows
not
older
the
lands
of
dream
among
though
all
the
world
wax
colder
though
all
the
songs
be
sung
in
dreams
doth
he
behold
her
still
fair
and
kind
and
young
now
the
silence
died
away
and
again
madness
came
upon
those
who
had
listened
and
looked
the
men
without
the
wall
once
more
hurled
themselves
against
the
gates
while
the
women
clung
to
them
shrieking
curses
on
the
beauty
of
the
hathor
for
the
song
meant
nothing
to
these
women
and
their
arms
were
about
those
whom
they
loved
and
who
won
them
their
bread
but
most
of
the
men
who
were
in
the
outer
court
rushed
up
to
the
inner
gates
within
which
stood
the
alabaster
shrine
of
the
hathor
some
flung
themselves
upon
the
ground
and
clutched
at
it
as
in
dreams
men
fling
themselves
down
to
be
saved
from
falling
into
a
pit
that
has
no
bottom
yet
as
in
such
an
evil
slumber
the
dreamer
is
drawn
inch
by
inch
to
the
mouth
of
the
pit
by
an
unseen
hand
so
these
wretched
men
were
dragged
along
the
ground
by
the
might
of
their
own
desire
in
vain
they
set
their
feet
against
the
stones
to
hold
themselves
from
going
for
they
thrust
forward
yet
more
fiercely
with
their
hands
and
thus
little
by
little
drew
near
the
inner
gates
writhing
forwards
yet
moving
backwards
like
a
wounded
snake
dragged
along
by
a
rope
for
of
those
who
thus
entered
the
outer
court
and
looked
upon
the
hathor
few
might
go
back
alive
now
the
priests
drew
the
cloths
from
their
eyes
and
rising
flung
wide
the
second
gates
and
there
but
a
little
way
off
the
veil
of
the
shrine
wavered
as
if
in
a
wind
for
now
the
doors
beyond
the
veil
were
thrown
open
as
might
be
seen
when
the
wind
swayed
its
tyrian
web
and
through
the
curtain
came
the
sound
of
the
same
sweet
singing
draw
near
draw
near
cried
the
ancient
priest
let
him
who
would
win
the
hathor
draw
near
now
at
first
the
wanderer
was
minded
to
rush
on
but
his
desire
had
not
wholly
overcome
him
nor
had
his
wisdom
left
him
he
took
counsel
with
his
heart
and
waited
to
let
the
others
go
and
to
see
how
it
fared
with
them
the
worshippers
were
now
hurrying
back
and
now
darting
onwards
as
fear
and
longing
seized
them
till
the
man
who
was
blind
drew
near
led
by
the
hand
of
a
priest
for
his
hound
might
not
enter
the
second
court
of
the
temple
do
ye
fear
he
cried
cowards
i
fear
not
it
is
better
to
look
upon
the
glory
of
the
hathor
and
die
than
to
live
and
never
see
her
more
set
my
face
straight
ye
priests
set
my
face
straight
at
the
worst
i
can
but
so
they
led
him
as
near
the
curtains
as
they
dared
to
go
and
set
his
face
straight
then
with
a
great
cry
he
rushed
on
but
he
was
caught
and
whirled
about
like
a
leaf
in
a
wind
so
that
he
fell
he
rose
and
again
rushed
on
again
to
be
whirled
back
a
third
time
he
rose
and
rushed
on
smiting
with
his
blind
man
s
staff
the
blow
fell
and
stayed
in
and
there
came
a
hollow
sound
as
of
a
smitten
shield
and
the
staff
that
dealt
the
blow
was
shattered
then
there
was
a
noise
like
the
noise
of
clashing
swords
and
the
man
instantly
sank
down
dead
though
the
wanderer
could
see
no
wound
upon
him
draw
near
draw
near
cried
the
priest
again
this
one
is
fallen
let
him
who
would
win
the
hathor
draw
near
then
the
man
who
had
fled
from
the
host
of
the
apura
rushed
forward
crying
on
the
lion
of
his
tribe
back
he
was
hurled
and
back
again
but
at
the
third
time
once
more
there
came
the
sound
of
clashing
swords
and
he
too
fell
dead
draw
near
draw
near
cried
the
priest
another
has
fallen
let
him
who
would
win
the
hathor
draw
near
and
now
man
after
man
rushed
on
to
be
first
hurled
back
and
then
slain
of
the
clashing
swords
and
at
length
all
were
slain
save
the
wanderer
alone
then
the
priest
spake
wilt
thou
indeed
rush
on
to
doom
thou
glorious
man
thou
hast
seen
the
fate
of
many
be
warned
and
turn
never
did
i
turn
from
man
or
ghost
said
the
wanderer
and
drawing
his
short
sword
he
came
near
warily
covering
his
head
with
his
broad
shield
while
the
priests
stood
back
to
see
him
die
now
the
wanderer
had
marked
that
none
were
touched
till
they
stood
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
doorway
therefore
he
uttered
a
prayer
to
aphrodite
and
came
on
slowly
till
his
feet
were
within
a
bow
s
length
of
the
threshold
and
there
he
stood
and
listened
now
he
could
hear
the
very
words
of
the
song
that
the
hathor
sang
as
she
wove
at
her
loom
so
dread
and
sweet
it
was
that
for
a
while
he
thought
no
more
on
the
guardians
of
the
gate
nor
of
how
he
might
win
the
way
nor
of
aught
save
the
song
for
she
was
singing
shrill
and
clear
in
his
own
dear
tongue
the
tongue
of
the
achæans
paint
with
threads
of
gold
and
scarlet
paint
the
battles
fought
for
me
all
the
wars
for
argive
helen
storm
and
sack
by
land
or
sea
all
the
tale
of
loves
and
sorrows
that
have
been
and
are
to
be
paint
her
lips
that
like
a
cup
have
pledged
the
lips
of
heroes
all
paint
her
golden
hair
unwhitened
while
the
many
winters
fall
paint
the
beauty
that
is
mistress
of
the
wide
world
and
its
thrall
paint
the
storms
of
ships
and
chariots
rain
of
arrows
flying
far
paint
the
waves
of
warfare
leaping
up
at
beauty
like
a
star
like
a
star
that
pale
and
trembling
hangs
above
the
waves
of
war
paint
the
ancient
ilios
fallen
paint
the
flames
that
scaled
the
sky
when
the
foe
was
in
the
fortress
when
the
trumpet
and
the
cry
rang
of
men
in
their
last
onset
men
whose
hour
had
dawned
to
die
woe
for
me
once
loved
of
all
men
me
that
never
yet
have
known
how
to
love
the
hearts
that
loved
me
woe
for
woe
who
hear
the
moan
of
my
lovers
ghosts
that
perished
in
their
cities
overthrown
is
there
not
of
gods
or
mortals
oh
ye
gods
is
there
not
one
one
whose
heart
shall
mate
with
my
heart
one
to
love
ere
all
be
done
all
the
tales
of
wars
that
shall
be
for
my
love
beneath
the
sun
now
the
song
died
away
and
the
wanderer
once
more
bethought
him
of
the
wardens
of
the
gate
and
of
the
battle
which
he
must
fight
but
as
he
braced
himself
to
rush
on
against
the
unseen
foe
the
music
of
the
singing
swelled
forth
again
and
whether
he
willed
it
or
willed
it
not
so
sweet
was
its
magic
that
there
he
must
wait
till
the
song
was
done
and
now
stronger
and
more
gladly
rang
the
sweet
shrill
voice
like
the
voice
of
one
who
has
made
moan
through
the
livelong
winter
night
and
now
sees
the
chariot
of
the
dawn
climbing
the
eastern
sky
and
thus
the
hathor
sang
ah
within
my
heart
a
hunger
for
the
love
unfelt
unknown
stirs
at
length
and
wakes
and
murmurs
as
a
child
that
wakes
to
moan
left
to
sleep
within
some
silent
house
of
strangers
and
alone
so
my
heart
awakes
and
waking
moans
with
hunger
and
with
cold
cries
in
pain
of
dim
remembrance
for
the
joy
that
was
of
old
for
the
love
that
was
that
shall
be
half
forgot
and
half
foretold
have
i
dreamed
it
or
remembered
in
another
world
was
i
lived
and
loved
in
alien
seasons
moved
beneath
a
golden
sky
in
a
golden
clime
where
never
came
the
strife
of
men
that
die
but
the
gods
themselves
were
jealous
for
our
bliss
was
over
great
and
they
brought
on
us
division
and
the
horror
of
their
hate
and
they
set
the
snake
between
us
and
the
twining
coils
of
fate
and
they
said
go
forth
and
seek
each
other
s
face
and
only
find
shadows
of
that
face
ye
long
for
dreams
of
days
left
far
behind
love
the
shadows
and
be
loved
with
loves
that
waver
as
the
once
more
the
sweet
singing
died
away
but
as
the
wanderer
grasped
his
sword
and
fixed
the
broad
shield
upon
his
arm
he
remembered
the
dream
of
meriamun
the
queen
which
had
been
told
him
by
rei
the
priest
for
in
that
dream
twain
who
had
sinned
were
made
three
and
through
many
deaths
and
lives
must
seek
each
other
s
face
and
now
it
seemed
that
the
burden
of
the
song
was
the
burden
of
the
dream
then
he
thought
no
more
on
dreams
or
songs
or
omens
but
only
on
the
deadly
foe
that
stood
before
him
wrapped
in
darkness
and
on
helen
in
whose
arms
he
yet
should
lie
for
so
the
goddess
had
sworn
to
him
in
ithaca
he
spoke
no
word
he
named
no
god
but
sprang
forward
as
a
lion
springs
from
his
bed
of
reeds
and
lo
his
buckler
clashed
against
shields
that
barred
the
way
and
invisible
arms
seized
him
to
hurl
him
back
but
no
weakling
was
the
wanderer
thus
to
be
pushed
aside
by
magic
but
the
stoutest
man
left
alive
in
the
whole
world
now
that
aias
telamon
s
son
was
dead
the
priests
wondered
as
they
saw
how
he
gave
back
never
a
step
for
all
the
might
of
the
wardens
of
the
gate
but
lifted
his
short
sword
and
hewed
down
so
terribly
that
fire
leapt
from
the
air
where
the
short
sword
fell
the
good
short
sword
of
euryalus
the
phæacian
then
came
the
clashing
of
the
swords
and
from
all
the
golden
armour
that
once
the
paris
wore
ay
from
buckler
helm
and
greaves
and
breastplate
the
sparks
streamed
up
as
they
stream
from
the
anvil
of
the
smith
when
he
smites
great
blows
on
swords
made
white
with
fire
swift
as
hail
fell
the
blows
of
the
unseen
blades
upon
the
golden
armour
but
he
who
wore
it
took
no
harm
nor
was
it
so
much
as
marked
with
the
dint
of
the
swords
so
while
the
priests
wondered
at
this
miracle
the
viewless
wardens
of
the
gate
smote
at
the
wanderer
and
the
wanderer
smote
at
them
again
then
of
a
sudden
he
knew
this
that
they
who
barred
the
path
were
gone
for
no
more
blows
fell
and
his
sword
only
cut
the
air
then
he
rushed
on
and
passed
behind
the
veil
and
stood
within
the
shrine
but
as
the
curtains
swung
behind
him
the
singing
rose
again
upon
the
air
and
he
might
not
move
but
stood
fixed
with
his
eyes
gazing
where
far
up
a
loom
was
set
within
the
shrine
for
the
sound
of
the
singing
came
from
behind
the
great
web
gleaming
in
the
loom
the
sound
of
the
song
of
helen
as
she
heard
the
swords
clash
and
the
ringing
of
the
harness
of
those
whose
knees
were
loosened
in
death
it
was
thus
she
sang
clamour
of
iron
on
iron
and
shrieking
of
steel
upon
steel
hark
how
they
echo
again
life
with
the
dead
is
at
war
and
the
mortals
are
shaken
and
reel
the
living
are
slain
by
the
slain
clamour
of
iron
on
iron
like
music
that
chimes
with
a
song
so
with
my
life
doth
it
chime
and
my
footsteps
must
fall
in
the
dance
of
erinnys
a
revel
of
wrong
till
the
day
of
the
passing
of
time
ghosts
of
the
dead
that
have
loved
me
your
love
have
been
vanquished
of
death
but
unvanquished
of
death
is
your
hate
say
is
there
none
that
may
woo
me
and
win
me
of
all
that
draw
breath
not
one
but
is
envied
of
fate
now
the
song
died
and
the
wanderer
looked
up
and
before
him
stood
three
shadows
of
mighty
men
clad
in
armour
he
gazed
upon
them
and
he
knew
the
blazons
painted
on
their
shields
he
knew
them
for
heroes
long
dead
pirithous
theseus
and
aias
they
looked
upon
him
and
then
cried
with
one
voice
hail
to
thee
odysseus
of
ithaca
son
of
laertes
hail
to
thee
cried
the
wanderer
theseus
ægeus
son
once
before
didst
thou
go
down
into
the
house
of
hades
and
alive
thou
camest
forth
again
hast
thou
crossed
yet
again
the
stream
of
ocean
and
dost
thou
live
in
the
sunlight
for
of
old
i
sought
thee
and
found
thee
not
in
the
house
of
hades
the
semblance
of
theseus
answered
in
the
house
of
hades
i
abide
this
day
and
in
the
fields
of
asphodel
but
that
thou
seest
is
a
shadow
sent
forth
by
queen
persephone
to
be
the
guard
of
the
beauty
of
hail
to
thee
pirithous
ixion
s
son
cried
the
wanderer
again
hast
thou
yet
won
the
dread
persephone
to
be
thy
love
and
why
doth
hades
give
his
rival
holiday
to
wander
in
the
sunlight
for
of
old
i
sought
thee
and
found
thee
not
in
the
house
of
then
the
semblance
of
pirithous
answered
in
the
house
of
hades
i
dwell
this
day
and
that
thou
seest
is
but
a
shadow
which
goes
with
the
shadow
of
the
hero
theseus
for
where
he
is
am
i
and
where
he
goes
i
go
and
our
very
shadows
are
not
sundered
but
we
guard
the
beauty
of
hail
to
thee
aias
telamon
s
son
cried
the
wanderer
hast
thou
not
forgotten
thy
wrath
against
me
for
the
sake
of
those
accursed
arms
that
i
won
from
thee
the
arms
of
achilles
son
of
peleus
for
of
old
in
the
house
of
hades
i
spoke
to
thee
but
thou
wouldst
not
answer
one
word
so
heavy
was
thine
then
the
semblance
of
aias
made
answer
with
iron
upon
iron
and
the
stroke
of
bronze
on
bronze
would
i
answer
thee
if
i
were
yet
a
living
man
and
looked
upon
the
sunlight
but
i
smite
with
a
shadowy
spear
and
slay
none
but
men
foredoomed
and
i
am
the
shade
of
aias
who
dwells
in
hades
yet
the
queen
persephone
sent
me
forth
to
be
the
guard
of
the
beauty
of

the
wanderer
spake
tell
me
ye
shadows
of
the
sons
of
heroes
is
the
way
closed
and
do
the
gods
forbid
it
or
may
i
that
am
yet
a
living
man
pass
forward
and
gaze
on
that
ye
guard
on
the
beauty
of
helen
then
each
of
the
three
nodded
with
his
head
and
smote
once
upon
his
shield
saying
pass
by
but
look
not
back
upon
us
till
thou
hast
seen
thy
then
the
wanderer
went
by
into
the
innermost
chamber
of
the
alabaster
shrine
now
when
the
shadows
had
spoken
thus
they
grew
dim
and
vanished
and
the
wanderer
as
they
had
commanded
drew
slowly
up
on
the
alabaster
shrine
till
at
length
he
stood
on
the
hither
side
of
the
web
upon
the
loom
it
was
a
great
web
wide
and
high
and
hid
all
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
shrine
here
he
waited
not
knowing
how
he
should
break
in
upon
the
hathor
as
he
stood
wondering
thus
his
buckler
slipped
from
his
loosened
hand
and
clashed
upon
the
marble
floor
and
as
it
clashed
the
voice
of
the
hathor
took
up
the
broken
song
and
thus
she
sang
ever
more
sweetly
ghosts
of
the
dead
that
have
loved
me
your
love
has
been
vanquished
by
death
but
unvanquished
by
death
is
your
hate
say
is
there
none
that
may
woo
me
and
win
me
of
all
that
draw
breath
not
one
but
is
envied
of
fate
none
that
may
pass
you
unwounded
unscathed
of
invisible
spears
by
the
splendour
of
zeus
there
is
one
and
he
comes
and
my
spirit
is
touched
as
demeter
is
touched
by
the
tears
of
the
spring
and
the
kiss
of
the
sun
for
he
comes
and
my
heart
that
was
chill
as
a
lake
in
the
season
of
snow
is
molten
and
glows
as
with
fire
and
the
love
that
i
knew
not
is
born
and
he
laughs
in
my
heart
and
i
know
the
name
and
the
flame
of
desire
as
a
flame
i
am
kindled
a
flame
that
is
blown
by
a
wind
from
the
north
by
a
wind
that
is
deadly
with
cold
and
the
hope
that
awoke
in
me
faints
for
the
love
that
is
born
shall
go
forth
to
my
love
and
shall
die
as
of
old
now
the
song
sobbed
itself
away
but
the
heart
of
the
wanderer
echoed
to
its
sweetness
as
a
lyre
moans
and
thrills
when
the
hand
of
the
striker
is
lifted
from
the
strings
for
a
while
he
stood
thus
hidden
by
the
web
upon
the
loom
while
his
limbs
shook
like
the
leaves
of
the
tall
poplar
and
his
face
turned
white
as
turn
the
poplar
leaves
then
desire
overcame
him
and
a
longing
he
could
not
master
to
look
upon
the
face
of
her
who
sang
and
he
seized
the
web
upon
the
loom
and
rent
it
with
a
great
rending
noise
so
that
it
fell
down
on
either
side
of
him
and
the
gold
coils
rippled
at
his
feet
vii
the
shadow
in
the
sunlight
the
torn
web
fell
the
last
veil
of
the
strange
hathor
it
fell
and
all
its
unravelled
threads
of
glittering
gold
and
scarlet
rippled
and
coiled
about
the
wanderer
s
feet
and
about
the
pillars
of
the
loom
the
web
was
torn
the
veil
was
rent
the
labour
was
lost
the
pictured
story
of
loves
and
wars
was
all
undone
but
there
white
in
the
silvery
dusk
of
the
alabaster
shrine
there
was
the
visible
helen
the
bride
and
the
daughter
of
mystery
the
world
s
desire
there
shone
that
fabled
loveliness
of
which
no
story
was
too
strange
of
which
all
miracles
seemed
true
there
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
her
head
bowed
there
sat
she
whose
voice
was
the
echo
of
all
sweet
voices
she
whose
shape
was
the
mirror
of
all
fair
forms
she
whose
changeful
beauty
so
they
said
was
the
child
of
the
changeful
moon
helen
sat
in
a
chair
of
ivory
gleaming
even
through
the
sunshine
of
her
outspread
hair
she
was
clothed
in
soft
folds
of
white
on
her
breast
gleamed
the
starstone
the
red
stone
of
the
that
melts
in
the
sunshine
but
that
melted
not
on
the
breast
of
helen
moment
by
moment
the
red
drops
from
the
ruby
heart
of
the
star
fell
on
her
snowy
raiment
fell
and
vanished
fell
and
vanished
and
left
no
stain
the
wanderer
looked
on
her
face
but
the
beauty
and
the
terror
of
it
as
she
raised
it
were
more
than
he
could
bear
and
he
stood
like
those
who
saw
the
terror
and
the
beauty
of
that
face
which
changes
men
to
stone
for
the
lovely
eyes
of
helen
stared
wide
her
lips
yet
quivering
with
the
last
notes
of
song
were
wide
open
in
fear
she
seemed
like
one
who
walks
alone
and
suddenly
in
the
noonday
light
meets
the
hated
dead
encountering
the
ghost
of
an
enemy
come
back
to
earth
with
the
instant
summons
of
doom
for
a
moment
the
sight
of
her
terror
made
even
the
wanderer
afraid
what
was
the
horror
she
beheld
in
this
haunted
shrine
where
was
none
save
themselves
alone
what
was
with
them
in
the
shrine
then
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
golden
armour
which
paris
once
had
worn
on
the
golden
shield
with
the
blazon
of
the
white
bull
on
the
golden
helm
whose
visor
was
down
so
that
it
quite
hid
his
eyes
and
his
face
and
then
at
last
her
voice
broke
from
her
paris
paris
has
death
lost
hold
of
thee
hast
thou
come
to
drag
me
back
to
thee
and
to
shame
paris
dead
paris
who
gave
thee
courage
to
pass
the
shadows
of
men
whom
on
earth
thou
hadst
not
dared
to
face
in
war
then
she
wrung
her
hands
and
laughed
aloud
with
the
empty
laugh
of
fear
a
thought
came
into
that
crafty
mind
of
the
wanderer
s
and
he
answered
her
not
in
his
own
voice
but
in
the
smooth
soft
mocking
voice
of
the
traitor
paris
whom
he
had
heard
forswear
himself
in
the
oath
before
ilios
so
lady
thou
hast
not
yet
forgiven
paris
thou
weavest
the
ancient
web
thou
singest
the
ancient
songs
art
thou
still
unkind
as
of
old
why
art
thou
come
back
to
taunt
me
she
said
and
now
she
spoke
as
if
an
old
familiar
fear
and
horror
were
laying
hold
of
her
and
mastering
her
again
after
long
freedom
was
it
not
enough
to
betray
me
in
the
semblance
of
my
wedded
lord
why
dost
thou
mock
in
love
all
arts
are
fair
he
answered
in
the
voice
of
paris
many
have
loved
thee
lady
and
they
are
all
dead
for
thy
sake
and
no
love
but
mine
has
been
more
strong
than
death
there
is
none
to
blame
us
now
and
none
to
hinder
troy
is
down
the
heroes
are
white
dust
only
love
lives
yet
wilt
thou
not
learn
lady
how
a
shadow
can
love
she
had
listened
with
her
head
bowed
but
now
she
leaped
up
with
blazing
eyes
and
face
of
fire
begone
she
said
the
heroes
are
dead
for
my
sake
and
to
my
shame
but
the
shame
is
living
yet
begone
never
in
life
or
death
shall
my
lips
touch
the
false
lips
that
lied
away
my
honour
and
the
false
face
that
wore
the
favour
of
my
lord
for
it
was
by
and
magic
art
as
poets
tell
that
paris
first
beguiled
fair
helen
then
the
wanderer
spoke
again
with
the
sweet
smooth
voice
of
paris
son
of
priam
as
i
passed
up
the
shrine
where
thy
glory
dwells
helen
i
heard
thee
sing
and
thou
didst
sing
of
the
waking
of
thy
heart
of
the
arising
of
love
within
thy
soul
and
of
the
coming
of
one
for
whom
thou
dost
wait
whom
thou
didst
love
long
since
and
shalt
love
for
ever
more
and
as
thou
sangest
i
came
i
paris
who
was
thy
love
and
who
am
thy
love
and
who
alone
of
ghosts
and
men
shall
be
thy
love
again
wilt
thou
still
bid
me
go
i
sang
she
answered
yes
as
the
gods
put
it
in
my
heart
so
i
sang
for
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
came
who
was
my
love
of
old
and
whom
alone
i
must
love
alone
for
ever
but
thou
wast
not
in
my
heart
thou
false
paris
nay
i
will
tell
thee
and
with
the
name
will
scare
thee
back
to
hell
he
was
in
my
heart
whom
once
as
a
maid
i
saw
driving
in
his
chariot
through
the
ford
of
eurotas
while
i
bore
water
from
the
well
he
was
in
my
heart
whom
once
i
saw
in
troy
when
he
crept
thither
clad
in
beggar
s
guise
ay
paris
i
will
name
him
by
his
name
for
though
he
is
long
dead
yet
him
alone
methinks
i
loved
from
the
very
first
and
him
alone
i
shall
love
till
my
deathlessness
is
done
odysseus
son
of
laertes
odysseus
of
ithaca
he
was
named
among
men
and
odysseus
was
in
my
heart
as
i
sang
and
in
my
heart
he
shall
ever
be
though
the
gods
in
their
wrath
have
given
me
to
others
to
my
shame
and
against
my
now
when
the
wanderer
heard
her
speak
and
heard
his
own
name
upon
her
lips
and
knew
that
the
golden
helen
loved
him
alone
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
his
heart
would
burst
his
harness
no
word
could
he
find
in
his
heart
to
speak
but
he
raised
the
visor
of
his
helm
she
looked
she
saw
and
knew
him
for
odysseus
even
odysseus
of
ithaca
then
in
turn
she
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
speaking
through
them
said
oh
paris
ever
wast
thou
false
but
ghost
or
man
of
all
thy
shames
this
is
the
shamefullest
thou
hast
taken
the
likeness
of
a
hero
dead
and
thou
hast
heard
me
speak
such
words
of
him
as
helen
never
spoke
before
fie
on
thee
paris
fie
on
thee
who
wouldest
trick
me
into
shame
as
once
before
thou
didst
trick
me
in
the
shape
of
menelaus
who
was
my
lord
now
i
will
call
on
zeus
to
blast
thee
with
his
bolts
nay
not
on
zeus
will
i
call
but
on
odysseus
self
odysseus
come
thou
from
the
shades
and
smite
this
paris
this
trickster
who
even
in
death
finds
ways
to
mock
she
ceased
and
with
eyes
upturned
and
arms
outstretched
murmured
odysseus
odysseus
slowly
the
wanderer
drew
near
to
the
glory
of
the
golden
helen
slowly
slowly
he
came
till
his
dark
eyes
looked
into
her
eyes
of
blue
then
at
last
he
found
his
voice
and
spake
helen
argive
helen
he
said
i
am
no
shadow
come
up
from
hell
to
torment
thee
and
of
trojan
paris
i
know
nothing
for
i
am
odysseus
odysseus
of
ithaca
a
living
man
beneath
the
sunlight
hither
am
i
come
to
see
thee
hither
i
am
come
to
win
thee
to
my
heart
for
yonder
in
ithaca
aphrodite
visited
me
in
a
dream
and
bade
me
wander
out
upon
the
seas
till
at
length
i
found
thee
helen
and
saw
the
red
star
blaze
upon
thy
breast
and
i
have
wandered
and
i
have
dared
and
i
have
heard
thy
song
and
rent
the
web
of
fate
and
i
have
seen
the
star
and
lo
at
last
at
last
i
find
thee
well
i
saw
thou
knewest
the
arms
of
paris
who
was
thy
husband
and
to
try
thee
i
spoke
with
the
voice
of
paris
as
of
old
thou
didst
feign
the
voices
of
our
wives
when
we
lay
in
the
wooden
horse
within
the
walls
of
troy
thus
i
drew
the
sweetness
of
thy
love
from
thy
secret
breast
as
the
sun
draws
out
the
sweetness
of
the
flowers
but
now
i
declare
myself
to
be
odysseus
clad
in
the
mail
of
paris
odysseus
come
on
this
last
journey
to
be
thy
love
and
and
he
ceased
she
trembled
and
looked
at
him
doubtfully
but
at
last
she
spoke
well
do
i
remember
she
said
that
when
i
washed
the
limbs
of
odysseus
in
the
halls
of
ilios
i
marked
a
great
white
scar
beneath
his
knee
if
indeed
thou
art
odysseus
and
not
a
phantom
from
the
gods
show
me
that
great
then
the
wanderer
smiled
and
resting
his
buckler
against
the
pillar
of
the
loom
drew
off
his
golden
greave
and
there
was
the
scar
that
the
boar
dealt
with
his
tusk
on
the
parnassian
hill
when
odysseus
was
a
boy
look
lady
he
said
is
this
the
scar
that
once
thine
eyes
looked
on
in
the
halls
of
troy
yea
she
said
it
is
the
very
scar
and
now
i
know
that
thou
art
no
ghost
and
no
lying
shape
but
odysseus
self
come
to
be
my
love
and
lord
and
she
looked
most
sweetly
in
his
eyes
now
the
wanderer
wavered
no
more
but
put
out
his
arms
to
gather
her
to
his
heart
now
the
red
star
was
hidden
on
his
breast
now
the
red
drops
dripped
from
the
star
upon
his
mail
and
the
face
of
her
who
is
the
world
s
desire
grew
soft
in
the
shadow
of
his
helm
while
her
eyes
were
melted
to
tears
beneath
his
kiss
the
gods
send
all
lovers
like
joy
softly
she
sighed
softly
drew
back
from
his
arms
and
her
lips
were
opened
to
speak
when
a
change
came
over
her
face
the
kind
eyes
were
full
of
fear
again
as
she
gazed
where
through
the
window
of
the
shrine
of
alabaster
the
sunlight
flickered
in
gold
upon
the
chapel
floor
what
was
that
which
flickered
in
the
sunlight
or
was
it
only
the
dance
of
the
motes
in
the
beam
there
was
no
shadow
cast
in
the
sunshine
why
did
she
gaze
as
if
she
saw
another
watching
this
meeting
of
their
loves
however
it
chanced
she
mastered
her
fear
there
was
even
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
mirth
in
her
eyes
as
she
turned
and
spoke
again
odysseus
thou
art
indeed
the
cunningest
of
men
thou
hast
stolen
my
secret
by
thy
craft
who
save
thee
would
dream
of
craft
in
such
an
hour
for
when
i
thought
thee
paris
and
thy
face
was
hidden
by
thy
helm
i
called
on
odysseus
in
my
terror
as
a
child
cries
to
a
mother
methinks
i
have
ever
held
him
dear
always
i
have
found
him
ready
at
need
though
the
gods
have
willed
that
till
this
hour
my
love
might
not
be
known
nay
not
to
my
own
heart
so
i
called
on
odysseus
and
those
words
were
wrung
from
me
to
scare
false
paris
back
to
his
own
place
but
the
words
that
should
have
driven
paris
down
to
hell
drew
odysseus
to
my
breast
and
now
it
is
done
and
i
will
not
go
back
upon
my
words
for
we
have
kissed
our
kiss
of
troth
before
the
immortal
gods
have
we
kissed
and
those
ghosts
who
guard
the
way
to
helen
and
whom
thou
alone
couldst
pass
as
it
was
fated
are
witnesses
to
our
oath
and
now
the
ghosts
depart
for
no
more
need
they
guard
the
beauty
of
helen
it
is
given
to
thee
to
have
and
keep
and
now
is
helen
once
more
a
very
woman
for
at
thy
kiss
the
curse
was
broken
ah
friend
since
my
lord
died
in
pleasant
lacedæmon
what
things
have
i
seen
and
suffered
by
the
gods
decree
but
two
things
i
will
tell
thee
odysseus
and
thou
shalt
read
them
as
thou
mayest
though
never
before
in
thy
did
thy
lips
touch
mine
yet
i
know
that
not
now
for
the
first
time
we
kiss
and
this
i
know
also
for
the
gods
have
set
it
in
my
heart
that
though
our
love
shall
be
short
and
little
joy
shall
we
have
one
of
another
yet
death
shall
not
end
it
for
odysseus
i
am
a
daughter
of
the
gods
and
though
i
sleep
and
forget
that
which
has
been
in
my
sleep
and
though
my
shape
change
as
but
now
it
seemed
to
change
in
the
eyes
of
those
ripe
to
die
yet
i
die
not
and
for
thee
though
thou
art
mortal
death
shall
be
but
as
the
short
summer
nights
that
mark
off
day
from
day
for
thou
shalt
live
again
odysseus
as
thou
hast
lived
before
and
life
by
life
we
shall
meet
and
love
till
the
end
is
as
the
wanderer
listened
he
thought
once
more
of
that
dream
of
meriamun
the
queen
which
the
priest
rei
had
told
him
but
he
said
nothing
of
it
to
helen
for
about
the
queen
and
her
words
to
him
it
seemed
wisest
not
to
speak
it
will
be
well
to
live
lady
if
life
by
life
i
find
thee
for
a
life
by
life
thou
shalt
find
me
odysseus
in
this
shape
or
in
that
shalt
thou
find
me
for
beauty
has
many
forms
and
love
has
many
names
but
thou
shalt
ever
find
me
but
to
lose
me
again
i
tell
thee
that
as
but
now
thou
wonnest
thy
way
through
the
ranks
of
those
who
watch
me
the
cloud
lifted
from
my
mind
and
i
remembered
and
i
foresaw
and
i
knew
why
i
the
loved
of
many
might
never
love
in
turn
i
knew
then
odysseus
that
i
am
but
the
instrument
of
the
gods
who
use
me
for
their
ends
and
i
knew
that
i
loved
thee
and
thee
only
but
with
a
love
that
began
before
the
and
shall
not
be
consumed
by
the
funeral
so
be
it
lady
said
the
wanderer
for
this
i
know
that
never
have
i
loved
woman
or
goddess
as
i
love
thee
who
art
henceforth
as
the
heart
in
my
breast
that
without
which
i
may
not
now
speak
on
she
said
for
such
words
as
these
are
like
music
in
my
ay
i
will
speak
on
short
shall
be
our
love
thou
sayest
lady
and
my
own
heart
tells
me
that
it
is
born
to
be
brief
of
days
i
know
that
now
i
go
on
my
last
voyaging
and
that
death
comes
upon
me
from
the
water
the
swiftest
death
that
may
be
this
then
i
would
dare
to
ask
when
shall
we
twain
be
one
for
if
the
hours
of
life
be
short
let
us
love
while
we
now
helen
s
golden
hair
fell
before
her
eyes
like
the
bride
s
veil
and
she
was
silent
for
a
time
then
she
spoke
not
now
and
not
while
i
dwell
in
this
holy
place
may
we
be
wed
odysseus
for
so
should
we
call
down
upon
us
the
hate
of
gods
and
men
tell
me
then
where
thou
dwellest
in
the
city
and
i
will
come
to
thee
nay
it
is
not
meet
hearken
odysseus
one
hour
before
the
midnight
see
that
thou
dost
stand
without
the
pylon
gates
of
this
my
temple
then
i
will
pass
out
to
thee
as
well
i
may
and
thou
shalt
know
me
by
the
jewel
the
on
my
breast
that
shines
through
the
darkness
and
by
that
alone
and
lead
me
whither
thou
wilt
for
then
thou
shalt
be
my
lord
and
i
will
be
thy
wife
and
thereafter
as
the
gods
show
us
so
will
we
go
for
know
it
is
in
my
mind
to
fly
this
land
of
khem
where
month
by
month
the
gods
have
made
the
people
die
for
me
so
till
then
farewell
odysseus
my
love
found
after
many
it
is
well
lady
answered
the
wanderer
night
i
meet
thee
without
the
pylon
gates
i
also
am
minded
to
fly
this
land
of
witchcraft
and
of
horror
but
i
may
scarce
depart
till
pharaoh
return
again
for
he
has
gone
down
to
battle
and
left
me
to
guard
his
of
that
we
will
talk
hereafter
go
now
go
swiftly
for
here
we
may
not
talk
more
of
earthly
love
said
the
golden
helen
then
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
and
passed
from
before
her
glory
as
a
man
amazed
but
in
his
foolish
wisdom
he
spoke
no
word
to
her
of
meriamun
the
queen
viii
the
loosing
of
the
spirit
of
rei
rei
the
priest
had
fled
with
what
speed
he
might
from
the
gates
of
death
those
gates
that
guarded
the
loveliness
of
helen
and
opened
only
upon
men
doomed
to
die
the
old
man
was
heavy
at
heart
for
he
loved
the
wanderer
among
the
dark
children
of
khem
he
had
seen
none
like
this
achæan
none
so
goodly
so
strong
and
so
well
versed
in
all
arts
of
war
he
remembered
how
this
man
had
saved
the
life
of
her
he
loved
above
all
women
of
meriamun
the
the
fairest
queen
who
had
sat
upon
the
throne
of
egypt
the
fairest
and
the
most
learned
save
taia
only
he
bethought
him
of
the
wanderer
s
beauty
as
he
stood
upon
the
board
while
the
long
shafts
hailed
down
the
hall
then
he
recalled
the
vision
of
meriamun
which
she
had
told
him
long
years
ago
and
the
shadow
in
a
golden
helm
which
watched
the
changed
hataska
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
was
perplexed
and
lost
in
wonder
what
did
the
gods
intend
of
one
thing
he
was
sure
the
leaders
of
the
host
of
dreams
had
mocked
meriamun
the
man
of
her
vision
would
never
be
her
love
he
had
gone
to
meet
his
doom
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
perilous
so
rei
hasted
on
stumbling
in
his
speed
till
he
came
to
the
palace
and
passed
through
its
halls
towards
his
chamber
at
the
entrance
of
her
own
place
he
met
meriamun
the
queen
there
she
stood
in
the
doorway
like
a
picture
in
its
sculptured
frame
nor
could
any
sight
be
more
beautiful
than
she
was
clad
in
her
royal
robes
and
crowned
with
the
golden
snakes
her
black
hair
lay
soft
and
deep
on
her
and
her
eyes
looked
strangely
forth
from
beneath
the
ivory
of
her
brow
he
bowed
low
before
her
and
would
have
passed
on
but
she
stayed
him
whither
goest
thou
rei
she
asked
and
why
is
thy
face
so
sad
i
go
about
my
business
queen
he
answered
and
i
am
sad
because
no
tidings
come
of
pharaoh
nor
of
how
it
has
fared
with
him
and
the
host
of
the
perchance
thou
speakest
truth
and
yet
not
all
the
truth
she
answered
enter
i
would
have
speech
with
so
he
entered
and
at
her
command
seated
himself
before
her
in
the
very
seat
where
the
wanderer
had
sat
now
as
he
sat
thus
of
a
sudden
meriamun
the
queen
slid
to
her
knees
before
him
and
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
her
breast
was
shaken
with
sobs
and
while
he
wondered
thinking
that
she
wept
at
last
for
her
son
who
was
dead
among
the
firstborn
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
upon
his
knees
and
trembled
what
ails
thee
queen
my
fosterling
he
said
but
she
only
took
his
hand
and
laid
her
own
in
it
and
the
old
priest
s
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
so
she
sat
for
awhile
and
then
she
looked
up
but
still
she
did
not
find
words
and
he
caressed
the
beautiful
imperial
head
that
no
man
had
seen
bowed
before
what
is
it
my
daughter
he
said
and
she
answered
at
last
hear
me
old
friend
who
art
my
only
friend
for
if
i
speak
not
my
heart
will
surely
burst
or
if
it
break
not
my
brain
will
burn
and
i
shall
be
no
more
a
queen
but
a
living
darkness
where
vapours
creep
and
wandering
lights
shine
faintly
on
the
ruin
of
my
mind
mindest
thou
that
hour
it
was
the
night
after
the
hateful
night
that
saw
me
pharaoh
s
wife
when
i
crept
to
thee
and
told
thee
the
vision
that
had
come
upon
my
soul
had
come
to
mock
me
even
at
pharaoh
s
side
i
mind
it
well
said
rei
it
was
a
strange
vision
nor
might
my
wisdom
interpret
and
mindest
thou
what
i
told
thee
of
the
man
of
my
vision
the
glorious
man
whom
i
must
love
he
who
was
clad
in
golden
armour
and
wore
a
golden
helm
wherein
a
of
bronze
stood
fast
yes
i
mind
it
said
rei
and
how
is
that
man
named
she
asked
whispering
and
staring
on
him
with
wide
eyes
is
he
not
named
eperitus
the
wanderer
and
hath
he
not
come
hither
the
in
his
helm
and
is
not
the
hand
of
fate
upon
me
meriamun
hearken
rei
hearken
i
love
him
as
it
was
fated
i
should
love
when
first
i
looked
on
him
as
he
came
up
the
hall
of
audience
in
his
glory
i
knew
him
i
knew
him
for
that
man
who
shares
the
curse
laid
aforetime
on
him
and
on
the
woman
and
on
me
when
in
an
unknown
place
twain
became
three
and
were
doomed
to
strive
from
life
to
life
and
work
each
other
s
woe
upon
the
earth
i
knew
him
rei
though
he
knew
me
not
and
i
say
that
my
soul
shook
at
the
echo
of
his
step
and
my
heart
blossomed
as
the
black
earth
blossoms
when
after
flood
sihor
seeks
his
banks
again
a
glory
came
upon
me
rei
and
i
looked
back
through
all
the
mists
of
time
and
knew
him
for
my
love
and
i
looked
forward
into
the
depths
of
time
to
be
and
knew
him
for
my
love
then
i
looked
on
the
present
hour
and
naught
could
i
see
but
darkness
and
naught
could
i
hear
but
the
groans
of
dying
men
and
a
shrill
sound
as
of
a
woman
an
ill
tale
queen
said
rei
ay
an
ill
tale
rei
but
half
untold
hearken
again
i
will
tell
thee
all
madness
hath
entered
into
me
from
the
hathor
of
atarhechis
the
queen
of
desire
i
am
mad
with
love
even
i
who
never
loved
oh
rei
rei
i
would
win
this
man
nay
look
not
so
sternly
on
me
it
is
fate
that
drives
me
on
last
night
i
spoke
to
him
and
discovered
to
him
the
name
he
hides
from
us
his
own
name
odysseus
laertes
son
odysseus
of
ithaca
ay
thou
startest
but
so
it
is
i
learned
it
by
my
magic
and
wrung
the
truth
even
from
the
guile
of
the
most
crafty
of
men
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
turned
from
me
though
this
much
i
won
from
him
that
he
had
journeyed
from
far
to
seek
me
the
bride
that
the
gods
have
promised
the
priest
leaped
up
from
his
seat
lady
he
cried
lady
whom
i
serve
and
whom
i
have
loved
from
a
child
thy
brain
is
sick
and
not
thy
heart
thou
canst
not
love
him
dost
thou
not
remember
that
thou
art
queen
of
khem
and
pharaoh
s
wife
wilt
thou
throw
thy
honour
in
the
mire
to
be
trampled
by
a
wandering
stranger
ay
she
answered
i
am
queen
of
khem
and
pharaoh
s
wife
but
never
pharaoh
s
love
honour
why
dost
thou
prate
to
me
of
honour
like
nile
in
flood
my
love
hath
burst
the
bulwark
of
my
honour
and
i
mark
not
where
custom
set
it
for
all
around
the
waters
seethe
and
foam
and
on
them
like
a
broken
lily
floats
the
wreck
of
my
lost
honour
talk
not
to
me
of
honour
rei
teach
me
rather
how
i
may
win
my
hero
to
my
thou
art
mad
indeed
he
groaned
nevertheless
i
had
forgotten
this
must
needs
end
in
words
and
tears
meriamun
i
bring
thee
tidings
he
whom
thou
desireth
is
lost
to
thee
for
ever
to
thee
and
all
the
she
heard
then
sprang
from
the
couch
and
stood
over
him
like
a
lioness
over
a
smitten
stag
her
fierce
and
lovely
face
alive
with
rage
and
fear
is
he
dead
she
hissed
in
his
ear
dead
and
i
knew
it
not
then
thou
hast
murdered
him
and
thus
i
avenge
his
with
the
word
she
snatched
a
dagger
from
her
girdle
that
same
dagger
with
which
she
had
once
struck
at
meneptah
her
brother
when
he
would
have
kissed
her
and
high
it
flashed
above
rei
the
priest
nay
she
went
on
letting
the
knife
fall
after
another
fashion
shalt
thou
die
more
slowly
rei
yes
more
slowly
thou
knowest
the
torment
of
the
by
that
thou
shalt
die
she
paused
and
stood
above
him
with
quivering
limbs
and
breast
that
heaved
and
eyes
that
flashed
like
stars
stay
stay
he
cried
it
is
not
i
who
have
slain
this
wanderer
if
he
indeed
is
dead
but
his
own
folly
for
he
is
gone
up
to
look
upon
the
strange
hathor
and
those
who
look
upon
the
hathor
do
battle
with
the
unseen
swords
and
those
who
do
battle
with
the
unseen
swords
must
lie
in
the
baths
of
bronze
and
seek
the
under
the
face
of
meriamun
grew
white
at
this
word
as
the
alabaster
of
the
walls
and
she
cried
aloud
with
a
great
cry
then
she
sank
upon
the
couch
pressing
her
hand
to
her
brow
and
moaning
how
may
i
save
him
how
may
i
save
him
from
that
accursed
witch
alas
it
is
too
late
but
at
least
i
will
know
his
end
ay
and
hear
of
the
beauty
of
her
who
slays
him
rei
she
whispered
not
in
the
speech
of
khem
but
in
the
dead
tongue
of
a
dead
people
be
not
wrath
with
me
oh
have
pity
on
my
weakness
thou
knowest
of
the
of
the
spirit
is
it
not
so
i
am
instructed
he
answered
in
the
same
speech
twas
i
who
taught
thee
this
art
i
and
that
ancient
evil
which
is
true
it
was
thou
rei
thou
hast
ever
loved
me
so
thou
swearest
and
many
a
deed
of
dread
have
we
dared
together
lend
me
thy
spirit
rei
that
i
may
send
it
forth
to
the
temple
of
the
false
hathor
and
learn
what
passes
in
the
temple
and
of
the
death
of
him
whom
i
must
an
ill
deed
meriamun
and
a
fearful
he
answered
for
there
shall
my
spirit
meet
them
who
watch
the
gates
and
who
knows
what
may
chance
when
the
bodiless
one
that
yet
hath
earthly
life
meets
the
bodiless
ones
who
live
no
more
on
earth
yet
wilt
thou
dare
it
rei
for
love
of
me
as
being
instructed
thou
alone
canst
do
she
pleaded
never
have
i
refused
thee
aught
meriamun
nor
will
i
say
thee
nay
this
only
i
ask
of
thee
that
if
my
spirit
comes
back
no
more
thou
wilt
bury
me
in
that
tomb
which
i
have
made
ready
by
thebes
and
if
it
may
be
by
thy
strength
of
magic
wring
me
from
the
power
of
the
strange
wardens
i
am
prepared
thou
knowest
the
spell
say
he
sank
back
in
the
carven
couch
and
looked
upwards
then
meriamun
drew
near
to
him
gazed
into
his
eyes
and
whispered
in
his
ear
in
that
dead
tongue
she
knew
and
as
she
whispered
the
face
of
rei
grew
like
the
face
of
one
dead
she
drew
back
and
spoke
aloud
art
thou
loosed
spirit
of
rei
then
the
lips
of
rei
answered
her
saying
i
am
loosed
meriamun
whither
shall
i
go
to
the
court
of
the
temple
of
hathor
that
is
before
the
it
is
done
what
seest
thou
i
see
a
man
clad
in
golden
armour
he
stands
with
buckler
raised
before
the
doorway
of
the
shrine
and
before
him
are
the
ghosts
of
heroes
dead
though
he
may
not
see
them
with
the
eyes
of
the
flesh
from
within
the
shrine
there
comes
a
sound
of
singing
and
he
listens
to
the
what
does
he
hear
then
the
loosed
spirit
of
rei
the
priest
told
meriamun
the
queen
all
the
words
of
the
song
that
helen
sang
and
when
she
heard
and
knew
that
it
was
argive
helen
who
sat
in
the
halls
of
hathor
the
heart
of
the
queen
grew
faint
within
her
and
her
knees
trembled
yet
more
did
she
tremble
when
she
learned
those
words
that
rang
like
the
words
she
herself
had
heard
in
her
vision
long
ago
telling
of
bliss
that
had
been
of
the
hate
of
the
gods
and
of
the
unending
quest
now
the
song
ended
and
the
wanderer
went
up
against
the
ghosts
and
the
spirit
of
rei
speaking
with
the
lips
of
rei
told
all
that
befell
while
meriamun
hearkened
with
open
ears
ay
and
cried
aloud
with
joy
when
the
wanderer
forced
his
path
through
the
invisible
swords
then
once
more
the
sweet
voice
rang
and
the
loosed
spirit
of
rei
told
the
words
she
sang
and
to
meriamun
they
seemed
fateful
then
he
told
her
all
the
talk
that
passed
between
the
wanderer
and
the
ghosts
now
the
ghosts
being
gone
she
bade
the
spirit
of
rei
follow
the
wanderer
up
the
sanctuary
and
from
the
loosed
spirit
she
heard
how
he
rent
the
web
and
of
all
the
words
of
helen
and
of
the
craft
of
him
who
feigned
to
be
paris
then
the
web
was
torn
and
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
of
rei
looked
on
the
beauty
of
her
who
was
behind
it
tell
me
of
the
face
of
the
false
hathor
said
the
queen
and
the
spirit
of
rei
answered
her
face
is
that
beauty
which
gathered
like
a
mask
upon
the
face
of
dead
hataska
and
upon
the
face
of
the
bai
and
the
face
of
the
ka
when
thou
spakest
with
the
spirit
of
her
thou
hadst
now
meriamun
groaned
aloud
for
she
knew
that
doom
was
on
her
last
of
all
she
heard
the
telling
of
the
loves
of
odysseus
and
of
helen
her
undying
foe
of
their
kiss
of
their
betrothal
and
of
that
marriage
which
should
be
on
the
morrow
night
meriamun
the
queen
said
never
a
word
but
when
all
was
done
and
the
wanderer
had
left
the
shrine
again
she
whispered
in
the
ear
of
rei
the
priest
and
drew
back
his
spirit
to
him
so
that
he
awoke
as
a
man
awakes
from
sleep
he
awoke
and
saw
the
queen
sitting
over
against
him
with
a
face
white
as
the
face
of
the
dead
and
about
her
deep
eyes
were
lines
of
black
hast
thou
heard
meriamun
he
asked
i
have
heard
she
answered
what
dreadful
thing
hast
thou
heard
he
asked
again
for
he
knew
naught
of
that
which
his
spirit
had
seen
i
have
heard
things
that
may
not
be
told
she
said
but
this
i
will
tell
thee
he
of
whom
we
spoke
hath
passed
the
ghosts
he
hath
met
with
the
false
hathor
that
accursed
woman
and
he
returns
here
all
unharmed
now
go
rei
ix
the
waking
of
the
sleeper
rei
departed
wondering
and
heavy
at
heart
and
meriamun
the
queen
passed
into
her
and
there
she
bade
the
eunuchs
suffer
none
to
enter
made
fast
the
doors
and
threw
herself
down
upon
the
bed
hiding
her
face
in
its
woven
cushions
thus
she
lay
for
many
hours
as
one
dead
till
the
darkness
of
the
evening
gathered
in
the
chamber
but
though
she
moved
not
yet
in
her
heart
there
burned
a
fire
now
white
with
heat
as
the
breath
of
her
passion
fanned
it
and
now
waning
black
and
dull
as
the
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
for
now
she
knew
all
that
the
long
foreboding
sometimes
dreaded
sometimes
desired
and
again
like
a
dream
half
forgotten
was
indeed
being
fulfilled
she
knew
of
the
devouring
love
that
must
eat
her
life
away
knew
that
even
in
the
grave
she
should
find
no
rest
and
her
foe
was
no
longer
a
face
beheld
in
a
vision
but
a
living
woman
the
fairest
and
most
favoured
helen
of
troy
argive
helen
the
false
hathor
the
torch
that
fired
great
cities
the
centre
of
all
desire
whose
life
was
the
daily
doom
of
men
meriamun
was
beautiful
but
her
beauty
paled
before
the
face
of
helen
as
a
fire
is
slain
by
the
sun
magic
she
had
also
more
than
any
who
were
on
the
earth
but
what
would
her
spells
avail
against
the
magic
of
those
changing
eyes
and
it
was
helen
whom
the
wanderer
came
to
seek
for
he
had
travelled
the
wide
lands
and
sailed
the
seas
but
when
he
told
her
of
one
whom
he
desired
one
whom
he
sought
she
had
deemed
that
she
herself
was
that
one
ay
and
had
told
him
all
at
that
thought
she
laughed
out
in
the
madness
of
her
anger
and
her
shame
and
he
had
smiled
and
spoken
of
pharaoh
her
lord
and
the
while
he
spoke
he
had
thought
not
on
her
but
of
the
golden
helen
now
this
at
least
she
swore
that
if
he
might
not
be
hers
never
should
he
be
helen
s
she
would
see
him
dead
ere
that
hour
ay
and
herself
and
if
it
might
be
helen
would
she
see
dead
also
to
what
counsel
should
she
turn
on
the
morrow
night
these
two
meet
on
the
morrow
night
they
would
fly
together
then
on
the
morrow
must
the
wanderer
be
slain
how
should
he
be
slain
and
leave
no
tale
of
murder
by
poison
he
might
die
and
kurri
the
sidonian
should
be
charged
to
give
the
cup
and
then
she
would
slay
kurri
saying
that
he
had
poisoned
the
wanderer
because
of
his
hate
and
the
loss
of
his
goods
and
freedom
and
yet
how
could
she
slay
her
love
if
once
she
slew
him
then
she
too
must
die
and
seek
her
joy
in
the
kingdom
that
osiris
rules
and
there
she
might
find
little
gladness
what
then
should
she
do
no
answer
came
into
her
heart
there
was
one
that
must
answer
in
her
soul
now
she
rose
from
the
bed
and
stood
for
awhile
staring
into
the
dark
then
she
groped
her
way
to
a
place
where
there
was
a
carven
chest
of
and
ivory
and
drawing
a
key
from
her
girdle
she
opened
the
chest
within
were
jewels
mirrors
and
unguents
in
jars
of
alabaster
ay
and
poisons
of
deadly
bane
but
she
touched
none
of
these
thrusting
her
hand
deep
into
the
chest
she
drew
forth
a
casket
of
dark
metal
that
the
people
deemed
unholy
a
casket
made
of
typhon
s
bone
for
so
they
call
grey
iron
she
pressed
a
secret
spring
it
opened
and
feeling
within
she
found
a
smaller
casket
lifting
it
to
her
lips
she
whispered
over
it
words
of
no
living
speech
and
in
the
heavy
and
scented
dark
a
low
flame
flickered
and
trembled
on
her
lips
as
she
murmured
in
the
tongue
of
a
dead
people
then
slowly
the
lid
opened
of
itself
like
a
living
mouth
that
opens
and
as
it
opened
a
gleam
of
light
stole
up
from
the
box
into
the
dusk
of
the
chamber
now
meriamun
looked
and
shuddered
as
she
looked
yet
she
put
her
hand
into
the
box
and
muttering
come
forth
come
forth
thou
ancient
evil
drew
somewhat
to
her
and
held
it
out
from
her
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
behold
it
glowed
in
the
dusk
of
the
chamber
as
a
live
ember
glows
among
the
ashes
of
the
hearth
red
it
glowed
and
green
and
white
and
livid
blue
and
its
shape
as
it
lay
upon
her
hand
was
the
shape
of
a
coiling
snake
cut
as
it
were
in
opal
and
in
emerald
for
awhile
she
gazed
upon
it
shuddering
as
one
in
doubt
minded
i
am
to
let
thee
sleep
thou
horror
she
murmured
twice
have
i
looked
on
thee
and
i
would
look
no
more
nay
i
will
dare
it
thou
gift
of
the
old
wisdom
thou
frozen
fire
thou
sleeping
sin
thou
living
death
of
the
ancient
city
for
thou
alone
hast
thereon
she
unclasped
the
bosom
of
her
robe
and
laid
the
gleaming
toy
that
seemed
a
snake
of
stone
upon
her
ivory
breast
though
she
trembled
at
its
icy
touch
for
it
was
more
cold
than
death
with
both
her
hands
she
clasped
a
pillar
of
the
chamber
and
so
stood
and
she
was
shaken
with
throes
like
the
pangs
of
childbirth
thus
she
endured
awhile
till
that
which
was
grew
warm
watching
its
brightness
that
shone
through
her
silken
dress
as
the
flame
of
a
lamp
shines
through
an
alabaster
vase
so
she
stood
for
an
hour
then
swiftly
put
off
all
her
robes
and
ornaments
of
gold
and
loosing
the
dark
masses
of
her
hair
let
it
fall
round
her
like
a
veil
now
she
bent
her
head
down
to
her
breast
and
breathed
on
that
which
lay
upon
her
breast
for
the
ancient
evil
can
live
only
in
the
breath
of
human
kind
thrice
she
breathed
upon
it
thrice
she
whispered
awake
awake
and
the
first
time
that
she
breathed
the
thing
stirred
and
sparkled
the
second
time
that
she
breathed
it
undid
its
shining
folds
and
reared
its
head
to
hers
the
third
time
that
she
breathed
it
slid
from
her
bosom
to
the
floor
then
coiled
itself
about
her
feet
and
slowly
grew
as
grows
the
magician
s
magic
tree
greater
it
grew
and
greater
yet
and
as
it
grew
it
shone
like
a
torch
in
a
tomb
and
wound
itself
about
the
body
of
meriamun
wrapping
her
in
its
fiery
folds
till
it
reached
her
middle
then
it
reared
its
head
on
high
and
from
its
eyes
there
flowed
a
light
like
the
light
of
a
flame
and
lo
its
face
was
the
face
of
a
fair
woman
it
was
the
face
of
meriamun
now
face
looked
on
face
and
eyes
glared
into
eyes
still
as
a
white
statue
of
the
gods
stood
meriamun
the
queen
and
all
about
her
form
and
in
and
out
of
her
dark
hair
twined
the
flaming
snake
at
length
the
evil
spoke
spoke
with
a
human
voice
with
the
voice
of
meriamun
but
in
the
dead
speech
of
a
dead
people
tell
me
my
name
it
said
is
thy
name
answered
meriamun
the
queen
tell
me
whence
i
come
it
said
again
from
the
evil
that
is
in
me
answered
meriamun
tell
me
whither
i
where
i
go
there
thou
goest
for
i
have
warmed
thee
in
my
breast
and
thou
art
twined
about
my
then
the
snake
lifted
up
its
human
head
and
laughed
horribly
well
art
thou
instructed
it
said
so
i
love
thee
as
thou
lovest
me
and
it
bent
itself
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
i
am
that
ancient
evil
that
life
which
endures
out
of
the
first
death
i
am
that
death
which
abides
in
the
living
life
i
am
that
which
brought
on
thee
the
woe
that
is
in
division
from
the
heart
s
desire
and
the
name
thereof
is
from
life
to
life
thou
hast
found
me
at
thy
hand
now
in
this
shape
now
in
that
i
taught
thee
the
magic
which
thou
knowest
i
showed
thee
how
to
win
the
throne
now
what
wilt
thou
of
me
meriamun
my
mother
my
sister
and
my
child
from
life
to
life
i
have
been
with
thee
ever
thou
mightest
have
put
me
from
thee
ever
thou
fliest
to
the
wisdom
which
i
have
and
ever
from
thee
i
draw
my
strength
for
though
without
me
thou
mightest
live
without
thee
i
must
die
say
now
what
is
it
tell
me
and
i
will
name
my
price
no
more
will
i
ask
than
must
be
for
ah
i
am
glad
to
wake
and
live
again
glad
to
grip
thy
soul
within
these
shining
folds
to
be
fair
with
thy
beauty
to
be
foul
with
thy
sin
lay
thy
lips
against
my
ear
and
thine
ear
against
my
lips
said
meriamun
the
queen
and
i
will
say
what
it
is
that
i
will
of
thee
thou
ancient
so
the
evil
laid
its
ear
against
the
lips
of
meriamun
and
meriamun
laid
her
lips
against
its
ear
and
they
whispered
each
to
each
there
in
the
darkness
they
whispered
while
the
glittered
down
the
grey
snake
s
shining
folds
beamed
in
its
eyes
and
shone
through
the
queen
s
dark
hair
and
on
her
snowy
breast
at
length
the
tale
was
told
and
the
snake
lifted
its
woman
s
head
high
in
the
air
and
again
it
laughed
he
seeks
the
good
it
said
and
he
shall
find
the
ill
he
looks
for
light
and
in
darkness
shall
he
wander
to
love
he
turns
in
lust
he
shall
be
lost
he
would
win
the
golden
helen
whom
he
has
sought
through
many
a
way
whom
he
has
followed
o
er
many
a
sea
but
first
shall
he
find
thee
meriamun
and
through
thee
death
for
he
shall
swear
by
the
snake
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
far
hath
he
wandered
further
shall
he
wander
yet
for
thy
sin
shall
be
his
sin
darkness
shall
wear
the
face
of
light
evil
shall
shine
like
good
i
will
give
him
to
thee
meriamun
but
hearken
to
my
price
no
more
must
i
be
laid
cold
in
the
gloom
while
thou
walkest
in
the
sunshine
nay
i
must
be
twined
about
thy
body
fear
not
fear
not
i
shall
seem
but
a
jewel
in
the
eyes
of
men
a
girdle
fashioned
cunningly
for
the
body
of
a
queen
but
with
thee
henceforth
i
must
ever
go
and
when
thou
diest
with
thee
must
i
die
and
with
thee
pass
where
thou
dost
pass
with
thee
to
sleep
with
thee
to
awake
again
and
so
on
and
on
till
in
the
end
i
win
or
thou
winnest
or
she
wins
who
is
our
foe
i
give
thee
thy
price
said
meriamun
the
queen
so
once
before
thou
didst
give
it
answered
the
evil
ay
far
far
away
beneath
a
golden
sky
and
in
another
clime
happy
wast
thou
then
with
him
thou
dost
desire
but
i
twined
myself
about
thy
heart
and
of
twain
came
three
and
all
the
sorrow
that
has
been
so
woman
thou
hast
worked
so
woman
it
is
ordained
for
thou
art
she
in
whom
all
woes
are
gathered
in
whom
all
love
is
fulfilled
and
i
have
dragged
thy
glory
down
woman
and
i
have
loosed
thee
from
thy
gentleness
and
set
it
free
upon
the
earth
and
beauty
is
she
named
by
beauty
doth
work
who
is
the
golden
helen
and
for
her
beauty
s
sake
that
all
men
strive
to
win
are
wars
and
woes
are
hopes
and
prayers
and
longings
without
end
but
by
evil
dost
work
who
art
divorced
from
innocence
and
evil
shalt
thou
ever
bring
on
him
whom
thou
desireth
a
riddle
a
riddle
read
it
who
may
read
it
if
thou
canst
thou
who
art
named
meriamun
the
queen
but
who
art
less
than
queen
and
more
who
art
thou
who
is
she
they
named
the
helen
who
is
that
wanderer
who
seeks
her
from
afar
and
who
who
am
a
riddle
a
riddle
that
thou
mayst
not
read
yet
is
the
answer
written
on
earth
and
sky
and
sea
and
in
the
hearts
of
men
now
hearken
night
thou
shalt
take
me
and
twine
me
about
thy
body
doing
as
i
bid
thee
and
behold
for
a
while
thy
shape
shall
wear
the
shape
of
the
golden
helen
and
thy
face
shall
be
as
her
face
and
thine
eyes
as
her
eyes
and
thy
voice
as
her
voice
then
i
leave
the
rest
to
thee
for
as
helen
s
self
thou
shalt
beguile
the
wanderer
and
once
if
once
only
be
a
wife
to
him
whom
thou
desireth
naught
can
i
tell
thee
of
the
future
i
who
am
but
a
counsellor
but
hereafter
it
may
be
that
woes
will
come
woes
and
wars
and
death
but
what
matter
these
when
thou
hast
had
thy
desire
when
he
hath
sinned
and
hath
sworn
by
the
snake
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
and
when
he
is
bound
to
thee
by
ties
that
may
not
be
loosed
choose
meriamun
choose
put
my
counsel
from
thee
and
this
man
thou
lovest
shall
be
lost
to
thee
lost
in
the
arms
of
helen
and
alone
for
many
years
shalt
thou
bear
the
burden
of
thy
lonely
love
take
it
and
he
shall
at
least
be
thine
let
come
what
may
come
think
on
it
and
choose
thus
spake
the
ancient
evil
tempting
her
who
was
named
meriamun
while
she
hearkened
to
the
tempting
i
have
chosen
she
said
i
will
wear
the
shape
of
helen
and
be
a
wife
to
him
i
love
and
then
let
ruin
fall
sleep
thou
ancient
evil
sleep
for
no
more
may
i
endure
thy
face
of
fear
that
is
my
face
nor
the
light
of
those
flaming
eyes
that
are
my
eyes
made
again
the
thing
reared
its
human
head
and
laughed
out
in
triumph
then
slowly
it
unloosed
its
gleaming
coils
slowly
it
slid
to
the
earth
and
shrank
and
withered
like
a
flaming
scroll
till
at
length
it
seemed
once
more
but
a
shining
jewel
of
opal
and
of
amethyst
the
wanderer
when
he
left
the
inner
secret
shrine
saw
no
more
the
guardian
of
the
gates
nor
heard
the
clash
of
the
swords
unseen
for
the
gods
had
given
the
beauty
of
helen
to
odysseus
of
ithaca
as
it
was
foretold
without
the
curtains
the
priests
of
the
temple
were
gathered
wondering
little
could
they
understand
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
hero
who
was
called
eperitus
had
vanished
through
the
curtains
and
had
not
been
smitten
down
by
the
unseen
swords
and
when
they
saw
him
come
forth
glorious
and
unharmed
they
cried
aloud
with
fear
but
he
laughed
and
said
fear
not
victory
is
to
him
whom
the
gods
appoint
i
have
done
battle
with
the
wardens
of
the
shrine
and
passed
them
and
methinks
that
they
are
gone
i
have
looked
upon
the
hathor
also
and
more
than
that
seek
ye
not
to
know
now
give
me
food
for
i
am
so
they
bowed
before
him
and
leading
him
thence
to
their
chamber
of
banquets
gave
him
of
their
best
and
watched
him
while
he
ate
and
drank
and
put
from
him
the
desire
of
food
then
he
rose
and
went
from
the
temple
and
again
the
priests
bowed
before
him
moreover
they
gave
him
freedom
of
the
temple
and
keys
whereby
all
the
doors
might
be
opened
though
little
as
they
thought
had
he
any
need
of
keys
now
the
wanderer
walking
gladly
and
light
of
heart
came
to
his
own
lodging
in
the
courts
of
the
palace
at
the
door
of
the
lodging
stood
rei
the
priest
who
when
he
saw
him
ran
to
him
and
embraced
him
so
glad
was
he
that
the
wanderer
had
escaped
alive
little
did
i
think
to
look
upon
thee
again
eperitus
he
said
had
it
not
been
for
that
which
the
queen
and
he
bethought
himself
and
stayed
his
speech
nevertheless
here
i
am
unhurt
of
ghost
or
men
the
wanderer
answered
laughing
as
he
passed
into
the
lodging
but
what
of
the
queen

that
she
was
grieved
when
she
learned
that
thou
hadst
gone
up
to
the
temple
of
the
hathor
there
as
she
thought
to
perish
hearken
thou
eperitus
i
know
not
if
thou
art
god
or
man
but
oaths
are
binding
both
men
and
gods
and
thou
didst
swear
an
oath
to
pharaoh
is
it
not
so
ay
rei
i
swore
an
oath
that
i
would
guard
the
queen
well
till
pharaoh
came
art
thou
minded
to
keep
that
oath
eperitus
asked
rei
looking
on
him
strangely
art
thou
minded
to
guard
the
fair
fame
of
pharaoh
s
queen
that
is
more
precious
than
her
life
methinks
thou
dost
understand
my
meaning
eperitus
perchance
i
understand
answered
the
wanderer
know
rei
that
i
am
so
then
rei
spake
again
darkly
methinks
some
sickness
hath
smitten
meriamun
the
queen
and
she
craves
thee
for
her
physician
now
things
come
about
as
they
were
foreshown
in
the
portent
of
that
vision
whereof
i
spoke
to
thee
but
if
thou
dost
break
thy
oath
to
him
whose
salt
thou
eatest
then
eperitus
god
or
man
thou
art
a
have
i
not
said
that
i
have
no
mind
so
to
break
mine
oath
he
answered
then
sank
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
communed
with
his
crafty
heart
while
rei
watched
him
presently
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
spoke
rei
he
said
i
am
minded
to
tell
thee
a
strange
story
and
a
true
for
this
i
see
that
our
will
runs
one
way
and
thou
canst
help
me
and
in
helping
me
thyself
and
pharaoh
to
whom
i
swore
an
oath
and
her
whose
honour
thou
holdest
dear
but
this
i
warn
thee
rei
that
if
thou
dost
betray
me
not
thine
age
not
thy
office
nor
the
friendship
thou
hast
shown
me
shall
save
speak
on
odysseus
laertes
son
odysseus
of
ithaca
said
rei
may
my
life
be
forfeit
if
i
betray
thy
counsel
if
it
harm
not
those
i
now
the
wanderer
started
to
his
feet
crying
how
knowest
thou
that
name
i
know
it
said
rei
and
i
tell
thee
that
i
know
it
thou
most
crafty
of
men
to
show
this
that
with
me
thy
guile
will
not
avail
for
he
would
not
tell
him
that
he
had
it
from
the
lips
of
the
queen
thou
hast
heard
a
name
that
had
been
in
the
mouths
of
many
said
the
wanderer
perchance
it
is
mine
perchance
it
is
the
name
of
another
it
matters
not
now
know
this
i
fear
this
queen
of
thine
hither
i
came
to
seek
a
woman
but
the
queen
i
came
not
to
seek
yet
i
have
not
come
in
vain
for
yonder
rei
yonder
in
the
temple
of
the
hathor
i
found
her
on
whose
quest
i
came
and
who
awaited
me
there
well
guarded
till
i
should
come
to
take
her
on
the
morrow
night
i
go
forth
to
the
temple
and
there
by
the
gates
of
the
temple
i
shall
find
her
whom
all
men
desire
but
who
loves
me
alone
among
men
for
so
it
has
been
fated
of
the
gods
thence
i
bring
her
hither
that
here
we
may
be
now
this
is
my
mind
if
thou
wilt
aid
me
with
a
ship
and
men
that
at
the
first
light
of
dawn
we
should
flee
this
land
of
thine
and
that
thou
shouldest
keep
my
going
secret
for
awhile
till
i
have
gained
the
sea
true
it
is
that
i
swore
to
guard
the
queen
till
pharaoh
come
again
but
as
thou
knowest
things
are
so
that
i
can
best
guard
her
by
my
flight
and
if
pharaoh
thinks
ill
of
me
so
it
must
be
moreover
i
ask
thee
to
meet
me
by
the
pylon
of
the
temple
of
hathor
at
one
hour
before
midnight
there
will
we
talk
with
her
who
is
called
the
hathor
and
prepare
our
flight
and
thence
thou
shalt
go
to
that
ship
which
thou
hast
made
now
rei
thought
for
awhile
and
answered
somewhat
i
fear
to
look
upon
this
goddess
yet
i
will
dare
it
tell
me
then
how
shall
i
know
her
at
the
temple
s
gate
thou
shalt
know
her
rei
by
the
red
star
which
burns
upon
her
breast
but
fear
not
for
i
will
be
there
say
wilt
thou
make
the
ship
ready
the
ship
shall
be
ready
eperitus
and
though
i
love
thee
well
i
say
this
that
i
would
it
rode
the
waves
which
roll
around
the
shores
of
khem
and
thou
wert
with
it
and
with
thee
she
who
is
called
the
hathor
that
goddess
whom
thou
x
the
oath
of
the
wanderer
that
night
the
wanderer
saw
not
meriamun
but
on
the
morrow
she
sent
a
messenger
to
him
bidding
him
to
her
feast
that
night
he
had
little
heart
to
go
but
a
queen
s
courtesy
is
a
command
and
he
went
at
sundown
rei
also
went
to
the
feast
and
as
he
went
meeting
the
wanderer
in
the
he
whispered
to
him
that
all
things
were
made
ready
that
a
good
ship
waited
him
in
the
harbour
the
very
ship
that
he
had
captured
from
the
sidonians
and
that
he
rei
would
be
with
him
by
the
pylon
gate
of
the
temple
one
hour
before
midnight
presently
as
he
whispered
the
doors
were
flung
wide
and
meriamun
the
queen
passed
in
followed
by
eunuchs
and
she
was
royally
arrayed
her
face
was
pale
and
cold
but
her
great
eyes
glowed
in
it
low
the
wanderer
bowed
before
her
she
bent
her
head
in
answer
then
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
led
her
to
the
feast
they
sat
there
side
by
side
but
the
queen
spoke
little
and
that
little
of
pharaoh
and
the
host
of
the
apura
from
whom
no
tidings
came
when
at
length
the
feast
was
done
meriamun
bade
the
wanderer
to
her
private
chamber
and
thither
he
went
for
awhile
though
sorely
against
his
will
but
rei
came
not
in
with
them
and
thus
he
was
left
alone
with
the
queen
for
she
dismissed
the
waiting
ladies
when
they
had
gone
there
was
silence
for
a
space
but
ever
the
wanderer
felt
the
eyes
of
meriamun
watching
him
as
though
they
would
read
his
heart
i
am
weary
she
said
at
length
tell
me
of
the
wanderings
odysseus
of
ithaca
nay
tell
me
of
the
siege
of
ilios
and
of
the
sinful
helen
who
brought
all
these
woes
about
ay
and
tell
me
how
thou
didst
creep
from
the
leaguers
of
the
achæans
and
wrapped
in
a
beggar
s
weeds
seek
speech
of
this
evil
helen
now
justly
slain
of
the
angry
justly
slain
is
she
indeed
answered
the
crafty
wanderer
an
ill
thing
is
it
truly
that
the
lives
of
so
many
heroes
should
be
lost
because
of
the
beauty
of
a
faithless
woman
i
had
it
in
my
own
heart
to
slay
her
when
i
spoke
with
her
in
troy
town
but
the
gods
held
my
was
it
so
indeed
said
the
queen
smiling
darkly
doubtless
if
she
yet
lived
and
thou
sawest
her
thou
wouldst
slay
her
is
it
not
so
odysseus
she
lives
no
more
o
queen
he
answered
nay
she
lives
no
more
odysseus
now
tell
me
yesterday
thou
wentest
up
to
the
temple
of
the
hathor
tell
me
what
thou
didst
see
in
the
i
saw
a
fair
woman
or
perchance
an
immortal
goddess
stand
upon
the
pylon
brow
and
as
she
stood
and
sang
those
who
looked
were
bereft
of
reason
and
thereafter
some
tried
to
pass
the
ghosts
who
guarded
the
woman
and
were
slain
of
invisible
swords
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
a
strange
sight
surely
but
thou
didst
not
lose
thy
craft
odysseus
nor
try
to
break
through
the
ghosts
nay
meriamun
in
my
youth
i
looked
upon
the
beauty
of
argive
helen
who
was
fairer
than
she
who
stood
upon
the
pylon
tower
none
who
have
looked
upon
the
helen
would
seek
to
win
the
but
perchance
those
who
have
looked
upon
the
hathor
may
seek
to
win
the
helen
she
answered
slowly
and
he
knew
not
what
to
say
for
he
felt
the
power
of
her
magic
on
him
so
for
awhile
they
spoke
and
meriamun
knowing
all
wondered
much
at
the
guile
of
the
wanderer
but
she
showed
no
wonder
in
her
face
at
length
he
rose
and
bowing
before
her
said
that
he
must
visit
the
guard
that
watched
the
palace
gates
she
looked
upon
him
strangely
and
bade
him
go
then
he
went
and
right
glad
he
was
thus
to
be
free
of
her
but
when
the
curtains
had
swung
behind
him
meriamun
the
queen
sprang
to
her
feet
and
a
dreadful
light
of
daring
burned
in
her
eyes
she
clapped
her
hands
and
bade
those
who
came
to
her
seek
their
rest
as
she
would
also
for
she
was
weary
and
needed
none
to
wait
upon
her
so
the
women
went
leaving
her
alone
and
she
passed
into
her
sleeping
chamber
now
must
the
bride
deck
herself
for
the
bridal
she
said
and
straightway
pausing
not
drew
forth
the
ancient
evil
from
its
and
warmed
it
on
her
breast
breathing
the
breath
of
life
into
its
nostrils
now
as
before
it
grew
and
wound
itself
about
her
and
whispered
in
her
ear
bidding
her
clothe
herself
in
bridal
white
and
clasp
the
evil
around
her
then
think
upon
the
beauty
she
had
seen
gather
on
the
face
of
dead
hataska
in
the
temple
of
osiris
and
on
the
face
of
the
bai
and
the
face
of
the
ka
she
did
its
command
fearing
nothing
for
her
heart
was
alight
with
love
and
torn
with
jealous
hate
and
little
did
she
reck
of
the
sorrows
which
her
sin
should
bring
forth
so
she
bathed
herself
in
perfumes
shook
out
her
shining
hair
and
clad
herself
in
white
attire
then
she
looked
upon
her
beauty
in
the
mirror
of
silver
and
cried
in
the
bitterness
of
her
heart
to
the
evil
that
lay
beside
her
like
a
snake
asleep
ah
am
i
not
fair
enow
to
win
him
whom
i
love
say
thou
evil
must
i
indeed
steal
the
beauty
of
another
to
win
him
whom
i
love
this
must
thou
do
said
the
evil
or
lose
him
in
helen
s
arms
for
though
thou
art
fair
yet
is
she
beauty
s
self
and
her
gentleness
he
loves
and
not
thy
pride
choose
choose
swiftly
for
presently
the
wanderer
goes
forth
to
win
the
golden
then
she
doubted
no
more
but
lifting
the
shining
evil
held
it
to
her
with
a
dreadful
laugh
it
twined
itself
about
her
and
lo
it
shrank
to
the
shape
of
a
girdling
snake
of
gold
with
eyes
of
ruby
flame
and
as
it
shrank
meriamun
the
queen
thought
on
the
beauty
she
had
seen
upon
the
face
of
the
dead
hataska
on
the
face
of
the
bai
and
the
face
of
the
ka
and
all
the
while
she
watched
her
beauty
in
the
mirror
and
as
she
watched
behold
her
face
grew
as
the
face
of
death
ashen
and
hollow
then
slowly
burned
into
life
again
but
all
her
loveliness
was
changed
changed
were
her
dark
locks
to
locks
of
gold
changed
were
her
deep
eyes
to
eyes
of
blue
changed
was
the
glory
of
her
pride
to
the
sweetness
of
the
helen
s
smile
fairest
among
women
had
been
her
form
now
it
was
fairer
yet
and
now
now
she
was
beauty
s
self
and
like
to
swoon
at
the
dream
of
her
own
loveliness
so
ah
so
must
the
hathor
seem
she
said
and
lo
her
voice
rang
strangely
in
her
ears
for
the
voice
too
was
changed
it
was
more
soft
than
the
whispering
of
reeds
it
was
more
sweet
than
the
murmuring
of
bees
at
noon
now
she
must
go
forth
and
fearful
at
her
own
loveliness
and
heavy
with
her
sin
yet
glad
with
a
strange
joy
she
passes
from
her
chamber
and
glides
like
a
starbeam
through
the
still
halls
of
her
palace
the
white
light
of
the
moon
creeps
into
them
and
falls
upon
the
faces
of
the
dreadful
gods
on
the
awful
smile
of
sphinxes
and
the
pictures
of
her
forefathers
kings
and
queens
who
long
were
dead
and
as
she
goes
she
seems
to
hear
them
whisper
each
to
each
of
the
dreadful
sin
that
she
has
sinned
and
of
the
sorrow
that
shall
be
but
she
does
not
heed
and
never
stays
her
foot
for
her
heart
is
alight
as
with
a
flame
and
she
will
win
the
wanderer
to
her
arms
the
wanderer
sought
through
many
lives
found
after
many
deaths
now
the
wanderer
is
in
his
chamber
waiting
for
the
hour
to
set
forth
to
find
the
golden
helen
his
heart
is
alight
and
strange
dreams
of
the
past
go
before
his
eyes
and
strange
visions
of
long
love
to
be
his
heart
burns
like
a
lamp
in
the
blackness
and
by
that
light
he
sees
all
the
days
of
his
life
that
have
been
and
all
the
wars
that
he
has
won
and
all
the
seas
that
he
has
sailed
and
now
he
knows
that
these
things
are
dreams
indeed
illusions
of
the
sense
for
there
is
but
one
thing
true
in
the
life
of
men
and
that
is
love
there
is
but
one
thing
perfect
the
beauty
which
is
love
s
robe
there
is
but
one
thing
which
all
men
seek
and
are
born
to
find
at
last
the
heart
of
the
golden
helen
the
world
s
desire
that
is
peace
and
joy
and
rest
he
binds
his
armour
on
him
for
foes
may
lurk
in
darkness
and
takes
the
bow
of
eurytus
and
the
grey
bolts
of
death
for
perchance
the
fight
is
not
yet
done
he
must
cleave
his
way
to
joy
then
he
combs
his
locks
and
sets
the
golden
helm
upon
them
and
praying
to
the
gods
who
hear
not
he
passes
from
his
chamber
now
the
chamber
opened
into
a
great
hall
of
pillars
as
was
his
custom
when
he
went
alone
by
night
the
wanderer
glanced
warily
down
the
dusky
hall
but
he
might
see
little
because
of
the
shadows
nevertheless
the
moonlight
poured
into
the
centre
of
the
hall
from
the
clerestories
in
the
roof
and
lay
there
shining
white
as
water
beneath
black
banks
of
reeds
again
the
wanderer
glanced
with
keen
quick
eyes
for
there
was
a
sense
in
his
heart
that
he
was
no
more
alone
in
the
hall
though
whether
it
were
man
or
ghost
or
perchance
one
of
the
immortal
gods
who
looked
on
him
he
might
not
tell
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
a
shape
of
white
moving
far
away
in
the
shadow
then
he
grasped
the
black
bow
and
laid
hand
upon
his
quiver
so
that
the
shafts
rattled
now
it
would
seem
that
the
shape
in
the
shadow
heard
the
rattling
of
the
shafts
or
perchance
saw
the
moonlight
gleam
upon
the
wanderer
s
golden
harness
at
the
least
it
drew
near
till
it
came
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
of
light
there
it
paused
as
a
bather
pauses
ere
she
steps
into
the
fountain
the
wanderer
paused
also
wondering
what
the
shape
might
be
half
was
he
minded
to
try
it
with
an
arrow
from
the
bow
but
he
held
his
hand
and
watched
and
as
he
watched
the
white
shape
glided
into
the
space
of
moonlight
and
he
saw
that
it
was
the
form
of
a
woman
draped
in
white
and
that
about
her
shone
a
gleaming
girdle
and
in
the
girdle
gems
which
sparkled
like
the
eyes
of
a
snake
tall
was
the
shape
and
lovely
as
a
statue
of
aphrodite
but
who
or
what
it
was
he
might
not
tell
for
the
head
was
bent
and
the
face
hidden
awhile
the
shape
stood
thus
and
as
it
stood
the
wanderer
passed
towards
it
marvelling
much
till
he
also
stood
in
the
pool
of
moonlight
that
shimmered
on
his
golden
mail
then
suddenly
the
shape
lifted
its
face
so
that
the
light
fell
full
on
it
and
stretched
out
its
arms
towards
him
and
lo
the
face
was
the
face
of
the
argive
helen
of
her
whom
he
went
forth
to
seek
he
looked
upon
its
beauty
he
looked
upon
the
eyes
of
blue
upon
the
golden
hair
upon
the
shining
arms
then
slowly
very
slowly
and
in
silence
for
he
could
find
no
words
the
wanderer
drew
near
she
did
not
move
nor
speak
so
still
she
stood
that
scarce
she
seemed
to
breathe
only
the
shining
eyes
of
her
glittered
like
living
things
again
he
stopped
fearfully
for
he
held
that
this
was
surely
a
mocking
ghost
which
stood
before
him
but
still
she
neither
moved
nor
spoke
then
at
length
he
found
his
tongue
and
spoke
lady
he
whispered
is
it
indeed
thou
is
it
argive
helen
whom
i
look
upon
or
is
it
perchance
a
ghost
sent
by
queen
persephone
from
the
house
of
hades
to
make
a
mock
of
me
now
the
voice
of
helen
answered
him
in
sweet
tones
and
low
did
i
not
tell
thee
odysseus
of
ithaca
did
i
not
tell
thee
yesterday
in
the
halls
of
hathor
after
thou
hadst
overcome
the
ghosts
that
we
should
be
wed
wherefore
then
dost
thou
deem
me
of
the
number
of
the
bodiless
the
wanderer
hearkened
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
helen
the
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
helen
and
yet
his
heart
feared
guile
so
did
argive
helen
tell
me
of
a
truth
lady
but
this
she
said
that
i
should
find
her
by
the
pylon
of
the
temple
and
lead
her
thence
to
be
my
bride
thither
i
go
but
now
to
seek
her
but
if
thou
art
helen
how
comest
thou
to
these
palace
halls
and
where
lady
is
that
red
star
which
should
gleam
upon
thy
breast
that
star
which
weeps
out
the
blood
of
men
no
more
doth
the
red
dew
fall
from
the
star
that
was
set
upon
my
breast
odysseus
for
now
that
thou
hast
won
me
men
die
no
more
for
my
beauty
s
sake
gone
is
the
star
of
war
and
see
wisdom
rings
me
round
the
symbol
of
the
deathless
snake
that
signifies
love
eternal
thou
dost
ask
how
i
came
hither
i
who
am
immortal
and
a
daughter
of
the
gods
seek
not
to
know
odysseus
for
where
fate
puts
it
in
my
mind
to
be
there
do
the
gods
bear
me
wouldst
thou
then
that
i
leave
thee
odysseus
last
of
all
things
do
i
desire
this
he
answered
for
now
his
wisdom
went
now
he
forgot
the
words
of
aphrodite
warning
him
that
the
helen
might
be
known
by
one
thing
only
the
red
star
on
her
breast
whence
falls
the
blood
of
men
and
he
no
more
doubted
but
that
she
was
the
golden
helen
then
she
who
wore
the
helen
s
shape
stretched
out
her
arms
and
smiled
so
sweetly
that
the
wanderer
knew
nothing
any
more
save
that
she
drew
him
to
her
slowly
she
glided
before
him
ever
smiling
and
where
she
went
he
followed
as
men
follow
beauty
in
a
dream
she
led
him
through
halls
and
corridors
past
the
sculptured
statues
of
the
gods
past
sphinxes
and
pictures
of
kings
and
as
she
goes
once
more
it
seems
to
her
that
she
hears
them
whisper
each
to
each
the
horror
of
her
sin
and
the
sorrow
that
shall
be
but
naught
she
heeds
who
ever
leads
him
on
and
naught
he
hears
who
ever
follows
after
till
at
length
though
he
knows
it
not
they
stand
in
the
of
the
queen
and
by
pharaoh
s
golden
bed
then
once
more
she
speaks
odysseus
of
ithaca
whom
i
have
loved
from
the
beginning
and
whom
i
shall
love
till
all
deaths
are
done
before
thee
stands
that
loveliness
which
the
gods
predestined
to
thy
arms
now
take
thou
thy
bride
but
first
lay
thy
hand
upon
this
golden
snake
that
rings
me
round
the
new
bridal
gift
of
the
gods
and
swear
thy
marriage
oath
which
may
not
be
broken
swear
thus
odysseus
i
love
thee
woman
or
immortal
and
thee
alone
and
by
whatever
name
thou
art
called
and
in
whatever
shape
thou
goest
to
thee
i
will
cleave
and
to
thee
alone
till
the
day
of
the
passing
of
time
i
will
forgive
thy
sins
i
will
soothe
thy
sorrows
i
will
suffer
none
to
come
betwixt
thee
and
me
this
i
swear
to
thee
woman
or
immortal
who
dost
stand
before
me
i
swear
it
to
thee
woman
for
now
and
for
ever
for
here
and
hereafter
in
whatever
shape
thou
goest
on
the
earth
by
whatever
name
thou
art
known
among
swear
thou
thus
odysseus
of
ithaca
laertes
son
or
leave
me
and
go
thy
ways
great
is
the
oath
quoth
the
wanderer
for
though
now
he
feared
no
guile
yet
his
crafty
heart
liked
it
choose
and
choose
swiftly
she
answered
swear
the
oath
or
leave
me
and
never
see
me
more
leave
thee
i
will
not
and
can
not
if
i
would
he
said
lady
i
swear
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
snake
that
ringed
her
round
and
swore
the
dreadful
oath
yea
he
forgot
the
words
of
the
goddess
and
the
words
of
helen
and
he
swore
by
the
snake
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
by
the
immortal
gods
he
swore
it
by
the
symbol
of
the
snake
and
by
the
beauty
of
his
bride
and
as
he
swore
the
eyes
of
the
serpent
sparkled
and
the
eyes
of
her
who
wore
the
beauty
of
helen
shone
and
faintly
the
black
bow
of
eurytus
thrilled
forboding
death
and
war
but
little
the
wanderer
thought
on
guile
or
war
or
death
for
the
kiss
of
her
whom
he
deemed
the
golden
helen
was
on
his
lips
and
he
went
up
into
the
golden
bed
of
meriamun
xi
the
waking
of
the
wanderer
now
rei
the
priest
as
had
been
appointed
went
to
the
pylon
gate
of
the
temple
of
hathor
awhile
he
stood
looking
for
the
wanderer
but
though
the
hour
had
come
the
wanderer
came
not
then
the
priest
went
to
the
pylon
and
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
gate
as
he
stood
there
a
wicket
in
the
gate
opened
and
there
passed
out
a
veiled
figure
of
a
woman
upon
whose
breast
burned
a
red
jewel
that
shone
in
the
night
like
a
star
the
woman
waited
awhile
looking
down
the
moonlit
road
between
the
black
rows
of
sphinxes
but
the
road
lay
white
and
empty
and
she
turned
and
hid
herself
in
the
shadow
of
the
pylon
where
rei
could
see
nothing
of
her
except
the
red
star
that
gleamed
upon
her
breast
now
a
great
fear
came
upon
the
old
man
for
he
knew
that
he
looked
upon
the
strange
and
deadly
hathor
perchance
he
too
would
perish
like
the
rest
who
had
looked
on
her
to
their
ruin
he
thought
of
flight
but
he
did
not
dare
to
fly
then
he
too
stared
down
the
road
seeking
for
the
wanderer
but
no
shadow
crossed
the
moonlight
thus
things
went
for
awhile
and
still
the
hathor
stood
silently
in
the
shadow
and
still
the
star
shone
upon
her
breast
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
world
s
desire
must
wait
at
the
tryst
like
some
forsaken
village
maid
while
rei
the
priest
crouched
thus
against
the
pylon
wall
praying
for
the
coming
of
him
who
came
not
suddenly
a
voice
spoke
to
him
in
tones
sweeter
than
a
lute
who
art
thou
that
hidest
in
the
shadow
said
the
voice
he
knew
that
it
was
the
hathor
who
spoke
and
so
afraid
was
he
that
he
could
not
answer
then
the
voice
spoke
again
oh
thou
most
crafty
of
men
why
doth
it
please
thee
to
come
hither
to
seek
me
in
the
guise
of
an
aged
priest
once
odysseus
i
saw
thee
in
beggar
s
weeds
and
knew
thee
in
the
midst
of
thy
foes
shall
i
not
know
thee
again
in
peace
beneath
thy
folded
garb
and
thy
robes
of
white
rei
heard
and
knew
that
he
could
hide
himself
no
longer
therefore
he
came
forward
trembling
and
knelt
before
her
saying
oh
mighty
queen
i
am
not
that
man
whom
thou
didst
name
nor
am
i
hid
in
any
wrappings
of
disguise
nay
i
do
avow
myself
to
be
named
rei
the
chief
architect
of
pharaoh
the
commander
of
the
legion
of
amen
the
chief
of
the
treasury
of
amen
and
a
man
of
repute
in
this
land
of
khem
now
if
indeed
thou
art
the
goddess
of
this
temple
as
i
judge
by
that
red
jewel
which
burns
upon
thy
breast
i
pray
thee
be
merciful
to
thy
servant
and
smite
me
not
in
thy
wrath
for
not
by
my
own
will
am
i
here
but
by
the
command
of
that
hero
whom
thou
hast
named
and
for
whose
coming
i
await
be
merciful
therefore
and
hold
thy
fear
not
thou
rei
said
the
sweet
voice
little
am
i
minded
to
harm
thee
or
any
man
for
though
many
men
have
gone
down
the
path
of
darkness
because
of
me
who
am
a
doom
to
men
not
by
my
will
has
it
been
but
by
the
will
of
the
immortal
gods
who
use
me
to
their
ends
rise
thou
rei
and
tell
me
why
thou
art
come
hither
and
where
is
he
whom
i
have
named
then
rei
rose
and
looking
up
saw
the
light
of
the
helen
s
eyes
shining
on
him
through
her
veil
but
there
was
no
anger
in
them
they
shone
mildly
as
stars
in
an
evening
sky
and
his
heart
was
comforted
i
know
not
where
the
wanderer
is
o
thou
immortal
he
said
this
i
know
only
that
he
bade
me
meet
him
here
at
one
hour
before
midnight
and
so
i
perchance
he
too
will
come
anon
said
the
sweet
voice
but
why
did
he
whom
thou
namest
the
wanderer
bid
thee
meet
him
here
for
this
reason
o
hathor
he
told
me
that
this
night
he
should
be
wed
to
thee
and
was
minded
thereafter
to
fly
from
khem
with
thee
therefore
he
bade
me
come
who
am
a
friend
to
him
to
talk
with
thee
and
him
as
to
how
thy
flight
should
go
and
yet
he
comes
now
as
rei
spake
he
turned
his
face
upward
and
the
golden
helen
looked
upon
it
hearken
rei
she
said
but
yesterday
after
i
had
stood
upon
the
pylon
tower
as
the
gods
decreed
and
sang
to
those
who
were
ripe
to
die
i
went
to
my
shrine
and
wove
my
web
while
the
doomed
men
fell
beneath
the
swords
of
them
who
were
set
to
guard
my
beauty
but
who
now
are
gone
and
as
i
wove
one
passed
the
ghosts
and
rent
the
web
and
stood
before
me
it
was
he
whom
i
await
and
after
awhile
i
knew
him
for
odysseus
of
ithaca
laertes
son
but
as
i
looked
on
him
and
spake
with
him
behold
i
saw
a
spirit
watching
us
though
he
might
not
see
it
a
spirit
whose
face
i
knew
not
for
no
such
man
have
i
known
in
my
life
days
know
then
rei
that
the
face
of
the
spirit
was
face
and
its
robes
then
once
more
rei
trembled
in
his
fear
now
rei
i
bid
thee
tell
me
and
speak
the
truth
lest
evil
come
on
thee
not
at
my
hands
indeed
for
i
would
harm
none
but
at
the
hands
of
those
immortals
who
are
akin
to
me
what
did
thy
spirit
yonder
in
my
sacred
shrine
how
didst
thou
dare
to
enter
and
look
upon
my
beauty
and
hearken
to
my
words
oh
great
queen
said
rei
i
will
tell
thee
the
truth
and
i
pray
thee
let
not
the
wrath
of
the
gods
fall
upon
me
not
of
my
own
will
did
my
spirit
enter
into
thy
holy
place
nor
do
i
know
aught
of
what
it
saw
therein
seeing
that
no
memory
of
it
remains
in
me
nay
it
was
sent
of
her
whom
i
serve
who
is
the
mistress
of
all
magic
and
to
her
it
made
report
but
what
it
said
i
know
and
whom
dost
thou
serve
rei
and
why
did
she
send
thy
spirit
forth
to
spy
on
me
i
serve
meriamun
the
queen
and
she
sent
my
spirit
forth
to
learn
what
befell
the
wanderer
when
he
went
up
against
the
and
yet
he
said
naught
to
me
of
this
meriamun
say
rei
is
she
fair
of
all
women
who
live
upon
the
earth
she
is
the
very
of
sayest
thou
rei
look
now
and
say
if
meriamun
whom
thou
dost
serve
is
fairer
than
argive
helen
whom
thou
dost
name
the
hathor
and
she
lifted
her
veil
so
that
he
saw
the
face
that
was
beneath
now
when
he
heard
that
name
and
looked
upon
the
glory
of
her
who
is
beauty
s
self
rei
shrank
back
till
he
went
nigh
to
falling
on
the
earth
nay
he
said
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hand
nay
thou
art
fairer
than
then
tell
me
she
said
letting
fall
her
veil
again
and
for
thine
own
sake
tell
me
true
why
would
meriamun
the
queen
whom
thou
servest
know
the
fate
of
him
who
came
up
against
the
ghosts
wouldst
thou
know
daughter
of
amen
answered
rei
then
i
will
tell
thee
for
through
thee
alone
she
whom
i
serve
and
love
can
be
saved
from
shame
meriamun
doth
also
love
the
man
whom
thou
wouldst
now
when
the
golden
helen
heard
these
words
she
pressed
her
hand
against
her
bosom
so
i
feared
she
said
even
so
she
loves
him
and
he
comes
not
ah
if
it
be
so
now
rei
i
am
tempted
to
pay
this
queen
of
thine
in
her
own
craft
and
send
thy
spirit
forth
to
spy
on
her
nay
that
i
will
not
do
for
never
shall
helen
work
by
shameful
guile
or
magic
nay
but
we
will
hence
rei
we
will
go
to
the
palace
where
my
rival
dwells
there
to
learn
the
truth
fear
not
i
will
bring
no
ill
on
thee
nor
on
her
whom
thou
servest
lead
me
to
the
palace
rei
lead
me
now
the
wanderer
slept
in
the
arms
of
meriamun
who
wore
the
shape
of
argive
helen
his
golden
harness
was
piled
by
the
golden
bed
and
by
the
bed
stood
the
black
bow
of
eurytus
the
night
drew
on
towards
the
dawning
when
of
a
sudden
the
bow
awoke
and
sang
and
thus
it
sang
wake
wake
though
the
arms
of
thy
love
are
about
thee
yet
dearer
by
far
than
her
kiss
is
the
sound
of
the
fight
and
more
sweet
than
her
voice
is
the
cry
of
the
trumpet
and
goodlier
far
than
her
arms
is
the
battle
s
delight
and
what
eyes
are
so
bright
as
the
sheen
of
the
bronze
when
the
sword
is
aloft
what
breast
is
so
fair
as
the
shield
or
what
garland
of
roses
is
dear
as
the
helm
and
what
sleep
is
so
soft
as
the
sleep
of
slain
men
on
the
field
lo
the
snake
that
was
twined
about
the
form
of
her
who
wore
the
shape
of
helen
heard
the
magic
song
it
awoke
it
arose
it
twisted
itself
about
the
body
of
the
wanderer
and
the
body
of
her
who
wore
the
shape
of
helen
knitting
them
together
in
the
bond
of
sin
it
grew
and
lifting
its
woman
s
head
on
high
it
sang
in
answer
and
thus
it
sang
of
doom
sleep
be
at
rest
for
an
hour
as
in
death
men
believe
they
shall
rest
but
they
wake
and
thou
too
shalt
awake
in
the
dark
of
the
grave
do
they
stir
but
about
them
on
arms
and
on
breast
are
the
toils
and
the
coils
of
the
snake
by
the
tree
where
the
first
lovers
lay
did
i
watch
as
i
watch
where
he
lies
love
laid
on
the
bosom
of
lust
then
the
great
bow
answered
the
snake
and
it
sang
of
the
tree
where
the
first
lovers
sinned
was
i
shapen
i
bid
thee
arise
thou
slayer
that
soon
shall
be
and
the
snake
sang
reply
be
thou
silent
my
daughter
of
death
be
thou
silent
nor
wake
him
from
sleep
with
the
song
and
the
sound
of
thy
the
bow
heard
the
song
of
the
snake
the
death
heard
the
song
of
the
sin
and
again
its
thin
music
thrilled
upon
the
air
for
thus
it
sang
be
thou
silent
my
mother
of
sin
for
this
watch
it
is
given
me
to
keep
o
er
the
sleep
of
the
dealer
of
death
then
the
snake
sang
hush
hush
thou
art
young
and
thou
camest
to
birth
when
the
making
was
done
of
the
world
i
am
older
therein
and
the
bow
answered
but
without
me
thy
strength
were
as
weakness
the
prize
of
thy
strength
were
unwon
i
am
and
thy
daughter
o
sin
now
the
song
of
the
snake
and
the
song
of
the
bow
sunk
through
the
depths
of
sleep
till
they
reached
the
wanderer
s
ears
he
sighed
he
stretched
out
his
mighty
arms
he
opened
his
eyes
and
lo
they
looked
upon
the
eyes
that
bent
above
him
eyes
of
flame
that
lit
the
face
of
a
woman
the
face
of
meriamun
that
wavered
on
a
serpent
s
neck
and
suddenly
was
gone
he
cried
aloud
with
fear
and
sprang
from
the
couch
the
faint
light
of
the
dawning
crept
through
the
casements
and
fell
upon
the
bed
the
faint
light
of
the
dawning
fell
upon
the
golden
bed
of
pharaoh
s
queen
it
gleamed
upon
the
golden
armour
that
was
piled
by
the
bed
and
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
great
black
bow
it
shone
upon
the
face
of
her
who
lay
in
the
bed
then
he
remembered
surely
he
had
slept
with
the
golden
helen
who
was
his
bride
and
surely
he
had
dreamed
an
evil
dream
a
dream
of
a
snake
that
wore
the
face
of
pharaoh
s
queen
yea
there
lay
the
golden
helen
won
at
last
the
golden
helen
now
made
a
wife
to
him
now
he
mocked
his
own
fears
and
now
he
bent
to
wake
her
with
a
kiss
faintly
the
light
crept
and
gathered
on
her
face
ah
how
beautiful
she
was
in
sleep
nay
what
was
this
whose
face
was
this
beneath
his
own
not
so
had
helen
looked
in
the
shrine
of
her
temple
when
he
tore
the
web
not
so
had
helen
seemed
yonder
in
the
pillared
hall
when
she
stood
in
the
moonlit
space
not
so
had
she
seemed
when
he
sware
the
great
oath
to
love
her
and
her
alone
whose
beauty
was
it
then
that
now
he
saw
by
the
immortal
gods
it
was
the
beauty
of
meriamun
it
was
the
glory
of
the
pharaoh
s
queen
he
stared
upon
her
lovely
sleeping
face
while
terror
shook
his
soul
how
could
this
be
what
then
had
he
done
then
light
broke
upon
him
he
looked
around
the
chamber
there
on
the
walls
were
the
graven
images
of
the
gods
of
khem
there
above
the
bed
the
names
of
meneptah
and
meriamun
were
written
side
by
side
in
the
sacred
signs
of
khem
not
with
the
golden
helen
had
he
slept
but
with
the
wife
of
pharaoh
to
her
he
had
sworn
the
oath
and
she
had
worn
the
helen
s
shape
and
now
the
spell
was
broken
he
stood
amazed
and
as
he
stood
again
the
great
bow
thrilled
warning
him
of
death
to
come
then
his
strength
came
back
to
him
and
he
seized
his
armour
and
girt
it
about
him
piece
by
piece
till
he
lifted
the
golden
helm
it
slipped
from
his
hand
with
a
crash
it
fell
upon
the
marble
floor
with
a
crash
it
fell
and
she
who
slept
in
the
bed
awoke
with
a
cry
and
sprang
from
the
bed
her
dark
hair
streaming
down
her
held
to
her
by
the
golden
snake
with
gemmy
eyes
that
she
must
ever
wear
but
he
caught
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
threw
down
the
ivory
sheath
book
iii
i
the
vengeance
of
kurri
the
wanderer
and
pharaoh
s
queen
stood
face
to
face
in
the
twilight
of
the
chamber
they
stood
in
silence
while
bitter
anger
and
burning
shame
poured
into
his
heart
and
shone
from
his
eyes
but
the
face
of
meriamun
was
cold
as
the
dead
and
on
it
was
a
smile
such
as
the
carven
sphinxes
wear
only
her
breast
heaved
tumultuously
as
though
in
triumph
and
her
limbs
quivered
like
a
shaken
reed
at
length
she
spoke
why
lookest
thou
so
strangely
on
me
my
lord
and
love
and
why
hast
thou
girded
thy
harness
on
thy
back
scarcely
doth
glorious
ra
creep
from
the
breast
of
nout
and
wouldest
thou
leave
thy
bridal
bed
odysseus
still
he
spoke
no
word
but
looked
on
her
with
burning
eyes
then
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
came
towards
him
and
now
he
found
his
tongue
again
get
thee
from
me
he
said
in
a
voice
low
and
terrible
to
hear
get
thee
from
me
dare
not
to
touch
me
thou
who
art
a
harlot
and
a
witch
lest
i
forget
my
manhood
and
strike
thee
dead
before
that
thou
canst
not
do
odysseus
she
answered
soft
for
whatever
else
i
be
i
am
thy
wife
and
thou
art
bound
to
me
for
ever
what
was
the
oath
which
thou
didst
swear
not
five
short
hours
ago
i
swore
an
oath
indeed
but
not
to
thee
meriamun
i
swore
an
oath
to
argive
helen
whom
i
love
and
i
wake
to
find
thee
sleeping
at
my
side
thee
whom
i
nay
she
said
to
me
thou
didst
swear
the
oath
odysseus
for
thou
of
men
the
most
guileful
hast
at
length
been
in
guile
to
me
woman
or
immortal
thou
didst
swear
for
now
and
for
ever
for
here
and
hereafter
whatever
shape
thou
goest
on
the
earth
by
whatever
name
thou
art
known
among
oh
be
not
wroth
my
lord
but
hearken
what
matters
the
shape
in
which
thou
seest
me
at
the
least
am
i
not
fair
and
what
is
beauty
but
a
casket
that
hides
the
gem
within
tis
my
love
which
thou
hast
won
my
love
that
is
immortal
and
not
the
flesh
that
perishes
for
i
have
loved
thee
ay
and
thou
hast
loved
me
from
of
old
and
in
other
lives
than
this
and
i
tell
thee
that
we
shall
love
again
and
yet
again
when
thou
art
no
more
odysseus
of
ithaca
and
when
i
am
no
more
meriamun
a
queen
of
khem
but
while
we
walk
in
other
forms
upon
the
world
and
are
named
by
other
names
i
am
thy
doom
thou
wanderer
and
wherever
thou
dost
wander
through
the
fields
of
life
and
death
i
shall
be
at
thy
side
for
i
am
she
of
whom
thou
art
and
thou
art
he
of
whom
i
am
and
though
the
gods
have
severed
us
yet
must
we
float
together
down
the
river
of
our
lives
till
we
find
that
sea
of
which
the
spirit
knows
therefore
put
me
not
from
thee
and
raise
not
my
wrath
against
thee
for
if
i
used
my
magic
to
bring
thee
to
my
arms
yet
they
are
thy
and
once
more
she
came
towards
him
now
the
wanderer
drew
an
arrow
from
his
quiver
and
set
the
notch
against
his
breast
and
the
keen
barb
towards
the
breast
of
meriamun
draw
on
he
said
thus
will
i
take
thee
to
my
arms
again
hearken
meriamun
the
witch
meriamun
the
harlot
pharaoh
s
wife
and
queen
of
khem
to
thee
i
swore
an
oath
indeed
and
perchance
because
i
suffered
thy
guile
to
overcome
my
wisdom
because
i
swore
upon
that
which
circles
thee
about
and
not
by
the
red
star
which
gleams
upon
the
helen
s
breast
it
may
be
that
i
shall
lose
her
whom
i
love
so
indeed
the
queen
of
heaven
told
me
yonder
in
ithaca
though
to
my
sorrow
i
forgot
her
words
but
if
i
lose
her
or
if
i
win
know
this
that
i
love
her
and
her
only
and
i
hate
thee
like
the
gates
of
hell
for
thou
hast
tricked
me
with
thy
magic
thou
hast
stolen
the
shape
of
beauty
s
self
and
dared
to
wear
it
thou
hast
drawn
a
dreadful
oath
from
me
and
i
have
taken
thee
to
wife
and
more
thou
art
the
queen
of
khem
thou
art
pharaoh
s
wife
whom
i
swore
to
guard
but
thou
hast
brought
the
last
shame
upon
me
for
now
i
am
a
man
dishonoured
and
i
have
sinned
against
the
hospitable
hearth
and
the
god
of
guests
and
hosts
and
therefore
i
will
do
this
i
will
call
together
the
guard
of
which
i
am
chief
and
tell
them
all
thy
shame
ay
and
all
my
sorrow
i
will
shout
it
in
the
streets
i
will
publish
it
from
the
temple
tops
and
when
pharaoh
comes
again
i
will
call
it
into
his
ear
till
he
and
all
who
live
in
khem
know
thee
for
what
thou
art
and
see
thee
in
thy
naked
she
hearkened
and
her
face
grew
terrible
to
see
a
moment
she
stood
as
though
in
thought
one
hand
pressed
to
her
brow
and
one
upon
her
breast
then
she
spoke
is
that
thy
last
word
wanderer
it
is
my
last
word
queen
he
answered
and
turned
to
go
then
with
the
hand
that
rested
on
her
breast
she
rent
her
night
robes
and
tore
her
perfumed
hair
past
him
she
rushed
towards
the
door
and
as
she
ran
sent
scream
on
scream
echoing
up
the
painted
walls
the
curtains
shook
the
doors
were
burst
asunder
and
through
them
poured
guards
eunuchs
and
help
she
cried
pointing
to
the
wanderer
help
help
oh
save
mine
honour
from
this
evil
man
this
foreign
thief
whom
pharaoh
set
to
guard
me
and
who
guards
me
thus
this
coward
who
dares
to
creep
upon
me
the
queen
of
khem
even
as
i
slept
in
pharaoh
s
bed
and
she
cast
herself
upon
the
floor
and
threw
her
hair
about
her
and
lay
there
groaning
and
weeping
as
though
in
the
last
agony
of
shame
now
when
the
guards
saw
how
the
thing
was
a
great
cry
of
rage
and
shame
went
up
from
them
and
they
rushed
upon
the
wanderer
like
wolves
upon
a
stag
at
bay
but
he
leapt
backwards
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
even
as
he
leapt
he
set
the
arrow
in
his
hand
upon
the
string
of
the
great
black
bow
then
he
drew
it
to
his
ear
the
sang
the
arrow
rushed
forth
and
he
who
stood
before
it
got
his
death
again
the
sang
again
the
arrow
rushed
and
lo
another
man
was
sped
a
third
time
he
drew
the
bow
and
the
soul
of
a
third
went
down
the
ways
of
hell
now
they
rolled
back
from
him
as
the
waters
roll
from
a
rock
for
none
dares
face
the
shafts
of
death
they
shot
at
him
with
spears
and
arrows
from
behind
the
shelter
of
the
pillars
but
none
of
these
might
harm
him
for
some
fell
from
his
mail
and
some
he
caught
upon
his
buckler
now
among
those
who
had
run
thither
at
the
sound
of
the
cries
of
meriamun
was
that
same
kurri
the
miserable
captain
of
the
sidonians
whose
life
the
wanderer
had
spared
and
whom
he
had
given
to
the
queen
to
be
her
jeweller
and
when
kurri
saw
the
wanderer
s
plight
he
thought
in
his
greedy
heart
of
those
treasures
that
he
had
lost
and
of
how
he
who
had
been
a
captain
and
a
rich
merchant
of
sidon
was
now
nothing
but
a
slave
then
a
great
desire
came
upon
him
to
work
the
wanderer
ill
if
so
he
might
now
all
round
the
edge
of
the
chamber
were
shadows
for
the
light
was
yet
faint
and
kurri
crept
into
the
shadows
carrying
a
long
spear
in
his
hand
and
that
spear
was
hafted
into
the
bronze
point
which
had
stood
in
the
wanderer
s
helm
little
did
the
wanderer
glance
his
way
for
he
watched
the
lances
and
arrows
that
flew
towards
him
from
the
portal
so
the
end
of
it
was
that
the
sidonian
passed
round
the
chamber
unseen
and
climbed
into
the
golden
bed
of
pharaoh
on
the
further
side
of
the
bed
now
the
wanderer
stood
with
his
back
to
the
bed
and
a
spear
s
length
from
it
and
in
the
silken
hangings
were
fixed
spears
and
arrows
kurri
s
first
thought
was
to
stab
him
in
the
back
but
this
he
did
not
first
because
he
feared
lest
he
should
fail
to
pierce
the
golden
harness
and
the
wanderer
should
turn
and
slay
him
and
again
because
he
hoped
that
the
wanderer
would
be
put
to
death
by
torment
and
he
was
fain
to
have
a
hand
in
it
for
after
the
fashion
of
the
sidonians
he
was
skilled
in
the
tormenting
of
men
therefore
he
waited
till
presently
the
wanderer
let
fall
his
buckler
and
drew
the
bow
but
ere
the
arrow
reached
his
ear
kurri
had
stretched
out
his
spear
from
between
the
hangings
and
touched
the
string
with
the
keen
bronze
so
that
it
burst
asunder
and
the
grey
shaft
fell
upon
the
marble
floor
then
as
the
wanderer
cast
down
the
bow
and
turned
with
a
cry
to
spring
on
him
who
had
cut
the
cord
for
his
eye
had
caught
the
sheen
of
the
outstretched
spear
kurri
lifted
the
covering
of
the
purple
web
which
lay
upon
the
bed
and
deftly
cast
it
over
the
hero
s
head
so
that
he
was
inmeshed
thereon
the
soldiers
and
the
eunuchs
took
heart
seeing
what
had
been
done
and
ere
ever
the
wanderer
could
clear
himself
from
the
covering
and
draw
his
sword
they
rushed
upon
him
cumbered
as
he
was
they
might
not
easily
overcome
him
but
in
the
end
they
bore
him
down
and
held
him
fast
so
that
he
could
not
stir
so
much
as
a
finger
then
one
cried
aloud
to
meriamun
the
lion
is
trapped
o
queen
say
shall
we
slay
him
but
meriamun
who
had
watched
the
fray
through
cover
of
her
hands
shuddered
and
made
answer
nay
but
lock
his
tongue
with
a
gag
strip
his
armour
from
him
and
bind
him
with
fetters
of
bronze
and
make
him
fast
to
the
dungeon
walls
with
great
chains
of
bronze
there
shall
he
bide
till
pharaoh
come
again
for
against
pharaoh
s
honour
he
hath
sinned
and
shamefully
broken
that
oath
he
swore
to
him
and
therefore
shall
pharaoh
make
him
die
in
such
fashion
as
seems
good
to
now
when
kurri
heard
these
words
and
saw
the
wanderer
s
sorry
plight
he
bent
over
him
and
said
it
was
i
kurri
the
sidonian
who
cut
the
cord
of
thy
great
bow
eperitus
with
the
that
thou
gavest
back
to
me
i
cut
it
i
whose
folk
thou
didst
slay
and
madest
me
a
slave
and
i
will
crave
this
boon
of
pharaoh
that
mine
shall
be
the
hand
to
torment
thee
night
and
day
till
at
last
thou
diest
cursing
the
day
that
thou
wast
the
wanderer
looked
upon
him
and
answered
there
thou
liest
thou
sidonian
dog
for
this
is
written
in
thy
face
that
thou
thyself
shalt
die
within
an
hour
and
that
then
kurri
shrank
back
scowling
but
no
more
words
might
odysseus
speak
for
at
once
they
forced
his
jaws
apart
and
gagged
him
with
a
gag
of
iron
and
thereafter
stripping
his
harness
from
him
they
bound
him
with
fetters
as
the
queen
had
commanded
now
while
they
dealt
thus
with
the
wanderer
meriamun
passed
into
another
chamber
and
swiftly
threw
robes
upon
her
to
hide
her
disarray
clasping
them
round
her
with
the
golden
girdle
which
now
she
must
always
wear
but
her
long
hair
she
left
unbound
nor
did
she
wash
the
stain
of
tears
from
her
face
for
she
was
minded
to
seem
shamed
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
till
pharaoh
came
again
rei
and
the
golden
helen
passed
through
the
streets
of
the
city
till
they
came
to
the
palace
gates
and
here
they
must
wait
till
the
dawn
for
rei
thinking
to
come
thither
with
the
wanderer
who
was
captain
of
the
guard
had
not
learned
the
word
of
entry
easy
would
it
be
for
me
to
win
my
way
through
those
great
gates
said
the
helen
to
rei
at
her
side
but
it
is
my
counsel
that
we
wait
awhile
perchance
he
whom
we
seek
will
come
so
they
entered
the
porch
of
the
temple
of
osiris
that
looked
towards
the
gates
and
there
they
waited
till
the
dawn
gathered
in
the
eastern
sky
the
helen
spoke
no
word
but
rei
watching
her
knew
that
she
was
troubled
at
heart
though
he
might
not
see
her
face
because
of
the
veil
she
wore
for
from
time
to
time
she
sighed
and
the
red
star
rose
and
fell
upon
her
breast
at
length
the
first
arrow
of
the
dawn
fell
upon
the
temple
porch
and
she
spoke
now
let
us
enter
she
said
my
heart
forebodes
evil
indeed
but
much
of
evil
i
have
known
and
where
the
gods
drive
me
there
i
must
they
came
to
the
gates
and
the
man
who
watched
them
opened
to
the
priest
rei
and
the
veiled
woman
who
went
with
him
though
he
marvelled
at
the
beauty
of
the
woman
s
shape
where
are
thy
rei
asked
of
the
soldier
i
know
not
he
answered
but
anon
a
great
tumult
rose
in
the
palace
and
the
captain
of
the
gate
went
thither
leaving
me
only
to
guard
the
hast
thou
seen
the
lord
eperitus
rei
asked
again
nay
i
have
not
seen
him
since
last
night
nor
has
he
visited
the
guard
as
is
his
rei
passed
on
wondering
and
with
him
went
helen
as
they
trod
the
palace
they
saw
folk
flying
towards
the
hall
of
banquets
that
is
near
the
queen
s
chambers
some
bore
arms
in
their
hands
and
some
bore
none
but
all
fled
east
towards
the
hall
of
banquets
whence
came
a
sound
of
shouting
now
they
drew
near
the
hall
and
there
at
the
further
end
where
the
doors
are
that
lead
to
the
queen
s
chambers
a
great
crowd
was
gathered
hide
thee
lady
hide
thee
said
rei
to
her
who
went
with
him
for
methinks
that
death
is
afoot
here
see
here
hangs
a
curtain
stand
thou
behind
it
while
i
learn
what
this
tumult
she
stepped
behind
the
curtain
that
hung
between
the
pillars
as
rei
bade
her
for
now
helen
s
gentle
breast
was
full
of
fears
and
she
was
as
one
dazed
even
as
she
stepped
one
came
flying
down
the
hall
who
was
of
the
servants
of
rei
the
priest
stay
thou
rei
cried
to
him
and
tell
me
what
happens
ill
deeds
lord
said
the
servant
eperitus
the
wanderer
whom
pharaoh
made
captain
of
his
guard
when
he
went
forth
to
slay
the
rebel
apura
eperitus
hath
laid
hands
on
the
queen
whom
he
was
set
to
guard
but
she
fled
from
him
and
her
cries
awoke
the
guard
and
they
fell
upon
him
in
pharaoh
s
very
chamber
some
he
slew
with
shafts
from
the
great
black
bow
but
kurri
the
sidonian
cut
the
string
of
the
bow
and
the
wanderer
was
borne
down
by
many
men
now
they
have
bound
him
and
drag
him
to
the
dungeons
there
to
await
judgment
from
the
lips
of
pharaoh
see
they
bring
him
i
must
begone
on
my
errand
to
the
keeper
of
the
the
golden
helen
heard
the
shameful
tale
and
such
sorrow
took
her
that
had
she
been
mortal
she
had
surely
died
this
then
was
the
man
whom
she
had
chosen
to
love
this
was
he
whom
last
night
she
should
have
once
more
the
gods
had
made
a
mock
of
her
so
had
it
ever
been
so
should
it
ever
be
loveless
she
had
lived
all
her
life
days
now
she
had
learned
to
love
once
and
for
ever
and
this
was
the
fruit
of
it
she
clasped
the
curtain
lest
she
should
sink
to
the
earth
and
hearing
a
sound
looked
forth
a
multitude
of
men
came
down
the
hall
before
them
walked
ten
soldiers
bearing
a
litter
on
their
shoulders
in
the
litter
lay
a
man
gagged
and
fettered
with
fetters
of
bronze
so
that
he
might
not
stir
and
they
bore
him
as
men
bear
a
stag
from
the
chase
or
a
wild
bull
to
the
sacrifice
it
was
the
wanderer
s
self
the
wanderer
overcome
at
last
and
he
seemed
so
mighty
even
in
his
bonds
and
his
eyes
shone
with
so
fierce
a
light
that
the
crowd
shrank
from
him
as
though
in
fear
thus
did
helen
see
her
love
and
lord
again
as
they
bore
him
dishonoured
to
his
dungeon
cell
she
saw
and
a
moan
and
a
cry
burst
from
her
heart
a
moan
for
her
own
woe
and
a
cry
for
the
shame
and
faithlessness
of
him
whom
she
must
love
oh
how
fallen
art
thou
odysseus
who
wast
of
men
the
very
first
she
cried
he
heard
it
and
knew
the
voice
of
her
who
cried
and
he
gazed
around
the
great
veins
swelled
upon
his
neck
and
forehead
and
he
struggled
so
fiercely
that
he
fell
from
the
litter
to
the
ground
but
he
might
not
rise
because
of
the
fetters
nor
speak
because
of
the
gag
so
they
lifted
him
again
and
bore
him
thence
and
after
him
went
all
the
multitude
save
rei
alone
for
rei
was
fallen
in
shame
and
grief
because
of
the
tale
that
he
had
heard
and
of
the
deed
of
darkness
that
the
man
he
loved
had
done
for
not
yet
did
he
remember
and
learn
to
doubt
so
he
stood
hiding
his
eyes
in
his
hand
and
as
he
stood
helen
came
forth
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
saying
lead
me
hence
old
man
lead
me
back
to
my
temple
my
love
is
lost
indeed
but
there
where
i
found
it
i
will
abide
till
the
gods
make
their
will
clear
to
he
bowed
saying
no
word
and
following
helen
stepped
into
the
centre
of
the
hall
there
he
stopped
indeed
for
down
it
came
the
queen
her
hair
streaming
all
her
robes
disordered
and
her
face
stained
with
tears
she
was
alone
save
for
kurri
the
sidonian
who
followed
her
and
she
walked
wildly
as
one
distraught
who
knows
not
where
she
goes
nor
why
helen
saw
her
also
who
is
this
royal
lady
that
draws
near
she
asked
of
rei
it
is
meriamun
the
queen
she
whom
the
wanderer
hath
brought
to
stay
then
i
would
speak
with
nay
nay
cried
rei
she
loves
thee
not
lady
and
will
slay
that
can
not
be
helen
answered
ii
the
coming
of
pharaoh
presently
as
she
walked
meriamun
saw
rei
the
priest
and
the
veiled
woman
at
his
side
and
she
saw
on
the
woman
s
breast
a
red
jewel
that
burnt
and
glowed
like
a
heart
of
fire
then
like
fire
burned
the
heart
of
meriamun
for
she
knew
that
this
was
argive
helen
who
stood
before
her
helen
whose
shape
she
had
stolen
like
a
thief
and
with
the
mind
of
a
thief
say
she
cried
to
rei
who
bowed
before
her
say
who
is
this
woman
rei
looked
at
the
queen
with
terrified
eyes
and
spake
in
a
voice
of
warning
this
is
that
goddess
who
dwells
in
the
temple
of
hathor
he
said
let
her
pass
in
peace
o
in
peace
she
shall
pass
indeed
answered
meriamun
what
saidest
thou
old
dotard
that
goddess
nay
no
goddess
have
we
here
but
an
witch
who
hath
brought
woes
unnumbered
upon
khem
because
of
her
men
die
month
by
month
till
the
vaults
of
the
temple
of
hathor
are
full
of
her
slain
because
of
her
it
was
that
curse
upon
curse
fell
on
the
land
the
curse
of
water
turned
to
blood
of
hail
and
of
terrible
darkness
ay
and
the
curse
of
the
death
of
the
firstborn
among
whom
my
own
son
died
and
thou
hast
dared
rei
to
bring
this
witch
here
to
my
palace
halls
by
amen
if
i
had
not
loved
thee
always
thy
life
should
pay
the
price
and
thou
and
she
stretched
her
hand
towards
the
helen
thou
hast
dared
to
come
it
is
well
no
more
shalt
thou
bring
evil
upon
khem
hearken
slave
and
she
turned
to
kurri
the
sidonian
draw
that
knife
of
thine
and
plunge
it
to
the
hilt
in
the
breast
of
yonder
woman
so
shalt
thou
win
freedom
and
all
thy
goods
shall
be
given
thee
then
for
the
first
time
helen
spake
i
charge
thee
lady
she
said
in
slow
soft
tones
bid
not
thy
servant
do
this
deed
for
though
i
have
little
will
to
bring
evil
upon
men
yet
i
may
not
lightly
be
now
kurri
hung
back
doubtfully
fingering
his
dagger
draw
knave
draw
cried
meriamun
and
do
my
bidding
or
presently
thou
shalt
be
slain
with
this
same
when
the
sidonian
heard
these
words
he
cried
aloud
with
fear
for
he
well
knew
that
as
the
queen
said
so
it
would
be
done
to
him
instantly
he
drew
the
great
knife
and
rushed
upon
the
veiled
woman
but
as
he
came
helen
lifted
her
veil
so
that
her
eyes
fell
upon
his
eyes
and
the
brightness
of
their
beauty
was
revealed
to
him
and
when
he
saw
her
loveliness
he
stopped
suddenly
as
one
who
is
transfixed
of
a
spear
then
madness
came
upon
him
and
with
a
cry
he
lifted
the
knife
and
plunging
it
not
into
her
heart
but
into
his
own
fell
down
dead
this
then
was
the
miserable
end
of
kurri
the
sidonian
slain
by
the
sight
of
the
beauty
thou
seest
lady
said
helen
turning
from
the
dead
sidonian
no
man
may
harm
for
a
moment
the
queen
stood
astonished
while
rei
the
priest
muttered
prayers
to
the
protecting
gods
then
she
cried
begone
thou
living
curse
begone
wherefore
art
thou
come
here
to
work
more
woe
in
this
house
of
woe
and
death
fear
not
answered
the
helen
presently
i
will
begone
and
trouble
thee
no
more
thou
askest
why
i
am
come
hither
i
came
to
see
him
who
was
my
love
and
whom
but
last
night
i
should
have
wed
but
whom
the
gods
have
brought
to
shame
unspeakable
odysseus
of
ithaca
odysseus
laertes
son
for
this
cause
i
came
and
i
have
stayed
to
look
upon
the
face
of
her
whose
beauty
had
power
to
drive
the
thought
of
me
from
the
heart
of
odysseus
and
bring
him
who
of
all
men
was
the
greatest
hero
and
the
foremost
left
alive
to
do
a
dastard
deed
and
make
his
mighty
name
a
byword
and
a
scorn
knowest
thou
meriamun
that
i
find
the
matter
strange
since
if
all
else
be
false
yet
is
this
true
that
among
women
the
fairest
are
the
most
strong
thou
art
fair
indeed
meriamun
but
judge
if
thou
art
more
fair
than
argive
helen
and
she
drew
the
veil
from
her
face
so
that
the
splendour
of
her
beauty
shone
out
upon
the
queen
s
dark
loveliness
thus
for
awhile
they
stood
each
facing
each
and
to
rei
it
seemed
as
though
the
spirits
of
death
and
life
looked
one
on
another
as
though
the
darkness
and
the
daylight
stood
in
woman
s
shape
before
him
thou
art
fair
indeed
said
the
queen
but
in
this
witch
has
thy
beauty
failed
to
hold
him
whom
thou
wouldst
wed
from
the
most
shameless
sin
little
methinks
can
that
man
have
loved
thee
who
crept
upon
me
like
a
thief
to
snatch
my
honour
from
then
helen
bethought
her
of
what
rei
had
said
that
meriamun
loved
the
wanderer
and
she
spoke
again
now
it
comes
into
my
heart
egyptian
that
true
and
false
are
mixed
in
this
tale
of
thine
hard
it
is
to
believe
that
odysseus
of
ithaca
could
work
such
a
coward
deed
as
this
or
unbidden
seek
to
clasp
thee
to
his
heart
moreover
i
read
in
thine
eyes
that
thou
thyself
dost
love
the
man
whom
thou
namest
dastard
nay
hold
thy
peace
look
not
so
wildly
on
me
whom
thou
canst
not
harm
but
hearken
whether
thy
tale
be
true
or
false
i
know
not
who
use
no
magic
and
learn
those
things
only
that
the
gods
reveal
to
me
but
this
at
the
least
is
true
that
odysseus
whom
i
should
have
wed
has
looked
on
thee
with
eyes
of
love
even
in
that
hour
when
i
waited
to
be
made
his
wife
therefore
the
love
that
but
two
days
agone
bloomed
in
my
heart
dies
and
withers
or
if
it
does
not
at
least
i
cast
it
from
me
and
tread
its
flowers
beneath
my
feet
for
this
doom
the
gods
have
laid
upon
me
who
am
of
all
women
the
most
hapless
to
live
beloved
but
loveless
through
many
years
and
at
the
last
to
love
and
be
betrayed
and
now
i
go
hence
back
to
my
temple
shrine
but
fear
not
meriamun
not
for
long
shall
i
trouble
thee
or
khem
and
men
shall
die
no
more
because
of
my
beauty
for
i
shall
presently
pass
hence
whither
the
gods
appoint
and
this
i
say
to
thee
deal
gently
with
that
man
who
has
betrayed
my
faith
for
whatever
he
did
was
done
for
the
love
of
thee
it
is
no
mean
thing
to
have
won
the
heart
of
odysseus
of
ithaca
out
of
the
hand
of
argive
helen
fare
thee
well
meriamun
who
wouldst
have
slain
me
may
the
gods
grant
thee
better
days
and
more
of
joy
than
is
given
to
helen
who
would
look
upon
thy
face
no
thus
she
spake
and
letting
her
veil
fall
turned
to
go
for
awhile
the
queen
stood
shamed
to
silence
by
these
gentle
words
that
fell
like
dew
upon
the
fires
of
her
hate
but
ere
helen
had
passed
the
length
of
a
spear
her
fury
burned
up
again
what
should
she
let
this
strange
woman
go
this
woman
who
alone
of
all
that
breathed
was
more
beautiful
than
she
by
the
aid
of
whose
stolen
beauty
she
alone
had
won
her
love
and
for
whose
sake
she
had
endured
such
bitter
words
of
scorn
nay
while
helen
yet
lived
she
could
find
not
joy
nor
sleep
but
were
helen
dead
then
perchance
all
might
yet
be
well
and
the
wanderer
yet
be
hers
for
when
the
best
is
gone
men
turn
them
to
the
better
close
the
gates
and
bar
them
she
cried
to
the
men
who
now
streamed
back
into
the
hall
and
they
ran
to
do
her
bidding
so
that
before
helen
reached
the
palace
doors
they
had
been
shut
and
the
gates
of
bronze
beyond
had
clashed
like
the
shields
of
men
now
helen
drew
near
the
doors
stay
yon
witch
cried
the
queen
to
those
who
guarded
them
and
in
wonder
they
poised
their
spears
to
bar
the
way
to
helen
but
she
only
lifted
her
veil
and
looked
upon
them
then
their
arms
fell
from
their
hands
and
they
stood
amazed
at
the
sight
of
beauty
open
i
beseech
you
said
the
helen
gently
and
straightway
they
opened
the
doors
and
she
passed
through
followed
by
those
who
guarded
them
by
the
queen
and
by
rei
but
one
man
there
was
who
did
not
see
her
beauty
and
he
strove
in
vain
to
hold
back
the
doors
and
to
clasp
helen
as
she
passed
now
she
drew
near
to
the
gates
shoot
the
witch
cried
meriamun
the
queen
if
she
pass
the
gates
by
my
royal
word
i
swear
that
ye
shall
die
every
man
of
you
shoot
her
with
then
three
men
drew
their
bows
mightily
the
string
of
the
bow
of
one
burst
and
the
bow
was
shattered
and
the
arrow
of
the
second
slipped
as
he
drew
it
and
passing
downwards
pierced
his
foot
and
the
shaft
of
the
third
swerved
ere
it
struck
the
breast
of
helen
and
sunk
into
the
heart
of
that
soldier
who
was
next
to
the
queen
so
that
he
fell
down
dead
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
striven
to
hold
to
the
doors
and
clasp
the
helen
then
helen
turned
and
spoke
bid
not
thy
guard
to
shoot
again
meriamun
lest
the
arrow
find
heart
for
know
this
no
man
may
harm
me
and
once
more
she
lifted
her
veil
and
speaking
to
those
at
the
gates
said
open
i
beseech
you
and
let
the
hathor
now
their
weapons
fell
from
their
hands
and
they
looked
upon
her
beauty
and
they
too
made
haste
to
open
the
gates
the
great
gates
clanged
upon
their
sockets
and
rolled
back
she
passed
through
them
and
all
who
were
there
followed
after
her
but
when
they
looked
lo
she
had
mingled
with
the
people
who
went
to
and
fro
and
was
gone
then
meriamun
grew
white
with
rage
because
helen
whom
she
hated
had
escaped
her
and
turning
to
those
men
who
had
opened
the
doors
and
those
who
had
given
passage
of
the
gates
who
yet
stood
looking
on
each
other
with
dazed
eyes
she
doomed
them
to
die
but
rei
kneeling
before
her
prayed
for
their
lives
ill
will
come
of
it
o
queen
he
said
as
ill
came
to
yonder
sidonian
and
to
the
soldier
at
thy
feet
for
none
may
work
evil
on
this
goddess
or
those
who
befriended
the
goddess
slay
them
not
o
queen
lest
ill
tidings
follow
on
the
deed
then
the
queen
turned
on
him
madly
hearken
thou
rei
she
said
speak
thus
again
and
though
i
have
loved
thee
and
thou
hast
been
the
chief
of
the
servants
of
pharaoh
this
i
swear
that
thou
shalt
die
the
first
already
the
count
is
long
between
thee
and
me
for
it
was
thou
who
didst
bring
yon
accursed
witch
to
my
palace
now
thou
hast
heard
and
of
this
be
sure
as
i
have
spoken
so
i
will
do
get
thee
gone
get
thee
from
my
sight
i
say
lest
i
slay
thee
now
i
take
back
thy
honours
i
strip
thee
of
thy
offices
i
gather
thy
wealth
into
my
treasury
go
forth
a
beggar
and
let
me
see
thy
face
no
more
then
rei
held
his
peace
and
fled
for
it
were
better
to
stand
before
a
lioness
robbed
of
her
whelps
than
before
meriamun
in
her
rage
thereon
the
gates
were
shut
again
and
the
captain
of
the
gates
was
dragged
before
the
place
where
the
queen
stood
and
asking
no
mercy
and
taking
little
heed
for
still
his
soul
was
filled
with
the
beauty
of
helen
as
a
cup
with
wine
he
suffered
death
for
his
head
was
straightway
smitten
from
him
rei
watching
from
afar
groaned
aloud
then
turned
and
left
the
palace
but
the
queen
called
to
the
soldiers
to
slay
on
even
as
she
called
there
came
a
cry
of
woe
without
the
palace
gates
men
looked
each
on
each
again
the
cry
rose
and
a
voice
without
called
pharaoh
is
come
again
pharaoh
is
come
again
and
there
rose
a
sound
of
knocking
at
the
gates
now
for
that
while
meriamun
thought
no
more
of
slaying
the
men
but
bade
them
open
the
gates
they
opened
and
a
man
entered
clad
in
raiment
stained
with
travel
his
eyes
were
wild
his
hair
was
dishevelled
and
scarce
could
his
face
be
known
for
the
face
of
pharaoh
meneptah
it
was
so
marred
with
grief
and
fear
pharaoh
looked
on
the
queen
he
looked
upon
the
dead
who
lay
at
her
feet
then
laughed
aloud
what
he
cried
more
dead
is
there
then
no
end
to
death
and
the
number
of
his
slain
nay
here
he
doth
work
but
feebly
perchance
his
arm
grows
weary
come
where
are
dead
queen
bring
forth
thy
dead
what
hath
chanced
meneptah
that
thou
speakest
thus
madly
asked
the
queen
she
whom
they
name
the
hathor
hath
passed
here
and
these
and
another
who
lies
yonder
do
but
mark
her
path
speak
ay
i
will
speak
queen
i
have
a
merry
tale
to
tell
thou
sayest
that
the
hathor
hath
passed
here
and
these
mark
her
footsteps
well
i
can
cap
thy
story
he
whom
the
apura
name
jahveh
hath
passed
yonder
by
the
sea
of
weeds
and
there
lie
many
lie
to
mark
his
thy
host
where
is
thy
host
cried
the
queen
at
the
least
some
are
yes
queen
are
left
all
all
save
myself
alone
they
drift
to
and
fro
in
the
sea
of
weeds
they
lie
by
tens
of
thousands
on
its
banks
the
gulls
tear
their
eyes
the
lion
of
the
desert
rends
their
flesh
they
lie
unburied
their
breath
sighs
in
the
sea
gales
their
blood
sinks
into
the
salt
sands
and
osiris
numbers
them
in
the
hosts
of
hell
hearken
i
came
upon
the
tribes
of
the
apura
by
the
banks
of
the
sea
of
weeds
i
came
at
eve
but
i
might
not
fall
upon
them
because
of
a
veil
of
darkness
that
spread
between
my
armies
and
the
hosts
of
the
apura
all
night
long
through
the
veil
of
darkness
and
through
the
shrieking
of
a
great
gale
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
the
passing
of
a
mighty
people
the
clangour
of
their
arms
the
voices
of
captains
the
stamp
of
beasts
and
the
grinding
of
wheels
the
morning
came
and
lo
before
me
the
waters
of
the
sea
were
built
up
as
a
wall
on
the
right
hand
and
the
left
and
between
the
walls
of
water
was
dry
land
and
the
apura
passed
between
the
walls
then
i
cried
to
my
captains
to
arise
and
follow
swiftly
and
they
did
my
bidding
but
the
chariot
wheels
drew
heavily
in
the
sand
so
that
before
all
my
host
had
entered
between
the
waters
the
apura
had
passed
the
sea
then
of
a
sudden
as
last
of
all
i
passed
down
into
the
path
of
the
ocean
bed
the
great
wind
ceased
and
as
it
ceased
lo
the
walls
of
water
that
were
on
either
side
of
the
sea
path
fell
together
with
noise
like
the
noise
of
thunder
i
turned
my
chariot
wheels
and
fled
back
but
my
soldiers
my
chariots
and
my
horses
were
swallowed
once
more
they
were
seen
again
on
the
crest
of
the
black
waves
like
a
gleam
of
light
upon
a
cloud
once
a
great
cry
arose
to
the
heaven
then
all
was
done
and
all
was
still
and
of
my
hosts
i
alone
was
left
alive
of
so
pharaoh
spoke
and
a
great
groan
rose
from
those
who
hearkened
only
meriamun
spoke
so
shall
things
go
with
us
while
that
false
hathor
dwells
in
now
as
she
spoke
thus
again
there
came
a
sound
of
knocking
at
the
gates
and
a
cry
of
open
a
messenger
a
messenger
open
said
meriamun
though
his
tidings
be
ill
scarce
can
they
match
these
that
have
been
the
gates
were
opened
and
one
came
through
them
his
eyes
stared
wide
in
fear
so
dry
was
his
throat
with
haste
and
with
the
sand
that
he
stood
speechless
before
them
all
give
him
wine
cried
meriamun
and
wine
was
brought
then
he
drank
and
he
fell
upon
his
knees
before
the
queen
for
he
knew
not
pharaoh
thy
tidings
she
cried
be
swift
with
thy
let
the
queen
pardon
me
he
said
let
her
not
be
wrath
these
are
my
tidings
a
mighty
host
marches
towards
the
city
of
on
a
host
gathered
from
all
lands
of
the
peoples
of
the
north
from
the
lands
of
the
tulisha
of
the
shakalishu
of
the
liku
and
of
the
shairdana
they
march
swiftly
and
raven
they
lay
the
country
waste
naught
is
left
behind
them
save
the
smoke
of
burning
towns
the
flight
of
vultures
and
the
corpses
of
hast
done
said
meriamun
nay
o
queen
a
great
fleet
sails
with
them
up
the
eastern
mouth
of
sihor
and
in
it
are
twelve
thousand
chosen
warriors
of
the
aquaiusha
the
sons
of
those
men
who
sacked
troy
and
now
a
great
groan
went
up
to
heaven
from
the
lips
of
those
who
hearkened
only
meriamun
spoke
thus
and
yet
the
apura
are
gone
for
whose
sake
ye
say
came
the
plagues
they
are
fled
but
the
curse
remains
and
so
shall
things
ever
be
with
us
while
yon
false
hathor
dwells
in
iii
the
bed
of
torment
it
was
nightfall
and
pharaoh
sat
at
meat
and
meriamun
sat
by
him
the
heart
of
pharaoh
was
very
heavy
he
thought
of
that
great
army
which
now
washed
to
and
fro
on
the
waters
of
the
sea
of
weeds
of
whose
number
he
alone
had
lived
to
tell
the
tale
he
thought
also
of
the
host
of
the
apura
who
made
a
mock
of
him
in
the
desert
but
most
of
all
he
brooded
on
the
tidings
that
the
messenger
had
brought
tidings
of
the
march
of
the
barbarians
and
of
the
fleet
of
the
aquaiusha
that
sailed
on
the
eastern
stream
of
sihor
all
that
day
he
had
sat
in
his
council
chamber
and
sent
forth
messengers
east
and
north
and
south
bidding
them
gather
the
mercenaries
from
every
town
and
in
every
city
men
to
make
war
against
the
foe
for
here
in
his
city
of
tanis
there
were
left
but
five
thousand
soldiers
and
now
wearied
with
toil
and
war
he
sat
at
meat
and
as
he
sat
bethought
him
of
the
man
whom
he
had
left
to
guard
the
queen
where
then
is
that
great
wanderer
he
who
wore
the
golden
harness
he
asked
presently
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
thee
of
the
man
meriamun
answered
slowly
a
tale
which
i
have
not
told
because
of
all
the
evil
tidings
that
beat
about
our
ears
like
sand
in
a
desert
tell
on
said
pharaoh
then
she
bent
towards
him
whispering
in
his
ear
as
she
whispered
the
face
of
pharaoh
grew
black
as
the
night
and
ere
all
the
tale
was
done
he
sprang
to
his
feet
by
amen
and
by
ptah
he
cried
here
at
least
we
have
a
foe
whom
we
may
conquer
thou
and
i
meriamun
my
sister
and
my
queen
are
set
as
far
each
from
each
as
the
sky
is
set
from
the
temple
top
and
little
of
love
is
there
between
us
yet
i
will
wipe
away
this
blot
upon
thy
honour
which
also
is
a
blot
upon
my
own
sleepless
shall
this
wanderer
lie
and
sorry
shall
he
go
but
night
he
shall
sleep
thereupon
he
clapped
his
hands
summoning
the
guard
and
bade
them
pass
to
the
dungeon
where
the
wanderer
lay
and
lead
him
thence
to
the
place
of
punishment
he
bade
them
also
call
the
tormentors
to
make
ready
the
instruments
of
their
craft
and
await
him
in
the
place
of
punishment
then
he
sat
for
awhile
drinking
sullenly
till
one
came
to
tell
him
that
all
was
prepared
then
pharaoh
rose
comest
thou
with
me
he
asked
nay
said
meriamun
i
would
not
look
upon
the
man
again
and
this
i
charge
thee
go
not
down
to
him
this
night
let
him
be
found
upon
the
bed
of
torment
and
let
the
tormentors
give
him
food
and
wine
for
so
he
shall
die
more
hardly
then
let
them
light
the
fires
at
his
head
and
at
his
feet
and
leave
him
till
the
dawn
alone
in
the
place
of
torment
so
he
shall
die
a
hundred
deaths
ere
ever
his
death
as
thou
wilt
answered
pharaoh
mete
out
thine
own
punishment
when
i
have
slept
i
will
look
upon
his
and
he
spoke
to
his
servants
as
she
desired
the
wanderer
lay
on
the
bed
of
torment
in
the
place
of
torment
they
had
taken
the
gag
from
his
mouth
and
given
him
food
and
wine
as
pharaoh
commanded
he
ate
and
drank
and
his
strength
came
back
to
him
then
they
made
fast
his
fetters
lit
the
braziers
at
his
head
and
foot
and
left
him
with
mocking
words
he
lay
upon
the
bed
of
stone
and
groaned
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
here
then
was
the
end
of
his
wanderings
and
this
was
the
breast
of
the
golden
helen
in
whose
arms
aphrodite
had
sworn
that
he
should
lie
oh
that
he
were
free
again
and
stood
face
to
face
with
his
foes
his
harness
on
his
back
nay
it
might
not
be
no
mortal
strength
could
burst
these
fetters
not
even
the
strength
of
odysseus
laertes
son
where
now
were
those
gods
whom
he
had
served
should
he
never
again
hear
the
clarion
cry
of
pallas
why
then
had
he
turned
him
from
pallas
and
worshipped
at
the
shrine
of
the
false
idalian
queen
thus
it
was
that
she
kept
her
oaths
thus
she
repaid
her
votary
so
he
thought
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
as
he
lay
with
closed
eyes
upon
the
bed
of
torment
whence
there
was
no
escape
and
groaned
would
aphrodite
that
i
had
never
served
thee
even
for
one
little
hour
then
had
my
lot
gone
now
he
opened
his
eyes
and
lo
a
great
glory
rolled
about
the
place
of
torment
and
as
he
wondered
at
the
glory
a
voice
spoke
from
its
midst
the
voice
of
the
idalian
aphrodite
blame
me
not
odysseus
said
the
heavenly
voice
blame
me
not
because
thou
art
come
to
this
pass
thyself
son
of
laertes
art
to
blame
what
did
i
tell
thee
was
it
not
that
thou
shouldst
know
the
golden
helen
by
the
red
star
on
her
breast
the
jewel
whence
fall
the
red
drops
fast
and
by
the
star
alone
and
did
she
not
tell
thee
also
that
thou
shouldst
know
her
by
the
star
yet
when
one
came
to
thee
wearing
no
star
but
girdled
with
a
snake
my
words
were
all
forgotten
thy
desires
led
thee
whither
thou
wouldst
not
go
thou
wast
blinded
by
desire
and
couldst
not
discern
the
false
from
the
true
beauty
has
many
shapes
now
it
is
that
of
helen
now
that
of
meriamun
each
sees
it
as
he
desires
it
but
the
star
is
yet
the
star
and
the
snake
is
yet
the
snake
and
he
who
bewildered
of
his
lusts
swears
by
the
snake
when
he
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
shall
have
the
snake
for
she
ceased
and
the
wanderer
spoke
groaning
bitterly
i
have
sinned
o
queen
he
said
is
there
then
no
forgiveness
for
my
sin
yea
there
is
forgiveness
odysseus
but
first
there
is
punishment
this
is
thy
fate
never
now
in
this
space
of
life
shalt
thou
be
the
lord
of
the
golden
helen
for
thou
hast
sworn
by
the
snake
and
his
thou
art
nor
mayest
thou
reach
the
star
yet
it
still
shines
on
through
the
mists
of
death
it
shall
shine
for
thee
and
when
thou
wakest
again
behold
thine
eyes
shall
see
it
fitfully
and
now
this
for
thy
comfort
here
thou
shalt
not
die
nor
by
torment
for
thy
death
shall
come
to
thee
from
the
water
as
the
dead
seer
foretold
but
ere
thou
diest
once
more
thou
shalt
look
upon
the
golden
helen
and
hear
her
words
of
love
and
know
her
kiss
though
thine
she
shall
not
be
and
learn
that
a
great
host
marches
upon
the
land
of
khem
and
with
it
sails
a
fleet
of
thine
own
people
the
achæans
go
down
and
meet
them
and
take
what
comes
where
the
swords
shine
that
smote
troy
and
this
fate
is
laid
upon
thee
that
thou
shalt
do
battle
against
thy
own
people
even
against
the
sons
of
them
by
whose
side
thou
didst
fight
beneath
the
walls
of
ilios
and
in
that
battle
thou
shalt
find
thy
death
and
in
thy
death
thou
wanderer
thou
shalt
find
that
which
all
men
seek
the
breast
of
the
immortal
helen
for
though
here
on
earth
she
seems
to
live
eternally
it
is
but
the
shadow
of
her
beauty
that
men
see
each
as
he
desires
it
in
the
halls
of
death
she
dwells
and
in
the
garden
of
queen
persephone
and
there
she
shall
be
won
for
there
no
more
is
beauty
guarded
of
those
that
stand
between
men
and
joy
and
there
no
more
shall
the
snake
seem
as
the
star
and
sin
have
power
to
sever
those
that
are
one
now
make
thy
heart
strong
odysseus
and
so
do
as
thy
wisdom
tells
thee
farewell
thus
the
goddess
spoke
from
the
cloud
of
glory
and
lo
she
was
gone
but
the
heart
of
the
wanderer
was
filled
with
joy
because
he
knew
that
the
helen
was
not
lost
to
him
for
ever
and
he
no
more
feared
the
death
of
shame
now
it
was
midnight
and
pharaoh
slept
but
meriamun
the
queen
slept
not
she
rose
from
her
bed
she
wrapped
herself
in
a
dark
cloak
that
hid
her
face
and
taking
a
lamp
in
her
hand
glided
through
the
empty
halls
till
she
came
to
a
secret
stair
down
which
she
passed
there
was
a
gate
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
a
guard
slept
by
it
she
pushed
him
with
her
foot
he
awoke
and
sprang
towards
her
but
she
held
a
signet
before
his
eyes
an
old
ring
of
great
queen
taia
whereon
a
hathor
worshipped
the
sun
then
he
bowed
and
opened
the
gate
she
swept
on
through
many
passages
deep
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
till
she
came
to
the
door
of
a
little
chamber
where
a
light
shone
men
talked
in
the
chamber
and
she
listened
to
their
talk
they
spoke
much
and
laughed
gleefully
then
she
entered
the
doorway
and
looked
upon
them
they
were
six
in
number
men
of
ethiopia
and
seated
in
a
circle
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
lay
the
waxen
image
of
a
man
and
they
were
cutting
it
with
knives
and
searing
it
with
needles
of
iron
and
pincers
made
and
many
instruments
strange
and
dreadful
to
look
upon
for
these
were
the
tormentors
and
they
spoke
of
those
pains
that
they
should
wreak
upon
the
wanderer
and
practised
them
but
meriamun
who
loved
him
shivered
as
she
looked
and
muttered
thus
beneath
her
breath
this
i
promise
you
black
ministers
of
death
that
in
the
same
fashion
ye
shall
die
ere
another
night
be
then
she
passed
into
the
chamber
holding
the
signet
on
high
and
the
tormentors
fell
upon
their
faces
before
her
majesty
she
passed
between
them
and
as
she
went
she
stamped
with
her
sandalled
foot
upon
the
waxen
image
and
brake
it
on
the
further
side
of
the
chamber
was
another
passage
and
this
she
followed
till
she
reached
a
door
of
stone
that
stood
ajar
here
she
paused
awhile
for
from
within
the
chamber
there
came
a
sound
of
singing
and
the
voice
was
the
wanderer
s
voice
and
thus
he
sang
endure
my
heart
not
long
shalt
thou
endure
the
shame
the
smart
the
good
and
ill
are
done
the
end
is
sure
endure
my
heart
there
stand
two
vessels
by
the
golden
throne
of
zeus
on
high
from
these
he
scatters
mirth
and
scatters
moan
to
men
that
die
and
thou
of
many
joys
hast
had
thy
share
thy
perfect
part
battle
and
love
and
evil
things
and
fair
endure
my
heart
fight
one
last
greatest
battle
under
shield
wage
that
war
well
then
seek
thy
fellows
in
the
shadowy
field
of
asphodel
there
is
the
knightly
hector
there
the
men
who
fought
for
troy
shall
we
not
fight
our
battles
o
er
again
were
that
not
joy
though
no
sun
shines
beyond
the
dusky
west
thy
perfect
part
there
shalt
thou
have
of
the
unbroken
rest
endure
my
heart
meriamun
heard
and
wondered
at
this
man
s
hardihood
and
the
greatness
of
his
heart
who
could
sing
thus
as
he
lay
upon
the
bed
of
torment
now
she
pushed
the
door
open
silently
and
passed
in
the
place
where
she
stood
was
dreadful
it
was
shaped
as
a
lofty
vault
and
all
the
walls
were
painted
with
the
torments
of
those
who
pass
down
to
set
after
living
wickedly
on
earth
in
the
walls
were
great
rings
of
bronze
and
chains
and
fetters
of
bronze
wherein
the
bones
of
men
yet
hung
in
the
centre
of
the
vault
there
was
a
bed
of
stone
on
which
the
wanderer
was
fastened
with
fetters
he
was
naked
save
only
for
a
waistcloth
and
at
his
head
and
feet
burned
polished
braziers
that
gave
light
to
the
vault
and
shone
upon
the
instruments
of
torment
beyond
the
further
braziers
grinned
the
gate
of
sekhet
that
is
shaped
like
a
woman
and
the
chains
wherein
the
victim
is
set
for
the
last
torment
by
fire
were
hanging
from
the
roof
meriamun
passed
stealthily
behind
the
head
of
the
wanderer
who
might
not
see
her
because
of
the
straitness
of
his
bonds
yet
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
heard
somewhat
for
he
ceased
from
singing
and
turned
his
ear
to
hearken
she
stood
awhile
in
silence
looking
on
him
she
loved
who
of
all
living
men
was
the
goodliest
by
far
then
at
length
he
spoke
craftily
who
art
thou
he
said
if
thou
art
of
the
number
of
the
tormentors
begin
thy
work
i
fear
thee
not
and
no
groan
shall
thy
worst
torture
wring
from
these
lips
of
mine
but
i
tell
thee
this
that
ere
i
be
three
days
dead
the
gods
shall
avenge
me
terribly
both
on
thee
and
those
who
sent
thee
with
fire
and
with
sword
they
shall
avenge
me
for
a
great
host
gathers
and
draws
nigh
a
host
of
many
nations
gathered
out
of
all
lands
ay
and
a
fleet
manned
with
the
sons
of
my
own
people
of
the
achæans
terrible
in
war
they
rush
on
like
ravening
wolves
and
the
land
is
black
before
them
but
the
land
shall
be
stamped
red
behind
their
feet
soon
they
shall
give
this
city
to
the
flames
the
smoke
of
it
shall
go
up
to
heaven
and
the
fires
shall
be
quenched
at
last
in
the
blood
of
its
children
ay
in
thy
blood
thou
who
dost
look
on
hearing
these
words
meriamun
bent
forward
to
look
on
the
face
of
the
speaker
and
to
see
what
was
written
there
and
as
she
moved
her
cloak
slipped
apart
showing
the
snake
s
head
with
the
eyes
of
flame
that
was
set
about
her
as
a
girdle
fiercely
they
gleamed
and
the
semblance
of
them
was
shown
faintly
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
brazier
wherein
the
fire
burned
at
the
wanderer
s
feet
he
saw
it
and
now
he
knew
who
stood
behind
him
say
meriamun
the
queen
pharaoh
s
dishonoured
wife
he
said
say
wherefore
art
thou
come
to
look
upon
thy
work
nay
stand
not
behind
me
stand
where
i
may
see
thee
fear
not
i
am
strongly
bound
nor
may
i
lift
a
hand
against
then
meriamun
still
speaking
no
word
but
wondering
much
because
he
knew
her
ere
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
passed
round
the
bed
of
torment
and
throwing
down
her
cloak
stood
before
him
in
her
dark
and
royal
loveliness
he
looked
upon
her
beauty
then
spoke
again
say
wherefore
art
thou
come
hither
meriamun
surely
with
my
ears
i
heard
thee
swear
that
i
had
wronged
thee
wouldst
thou
then
look
on
him
who
wronged
thee
or
art
thou
come
perchance
to
watch
my
torments
while
thy
slaves
tear
limb
from
limb
and
quench
yon
fires
with
my
blood
oh
thou
evil
woman
thou
hast
worked
woe
on
me
indeed
and
perchance
canst
work
more
woe
now
that
i
lie
helpless
here
but
this
i
tell
thee
that
thy
torments
shall
outnumber
mine
as
the
stars
outnumber
the
earth
for
here
and
hereafter
thou
shalt
be
parched
with
such
a
thirst
of
love
as
never
may
be
quenched
and
in
many
another
land
and
in
many
another
time
thou
shalt
endure
thine
agony
afresh
again
and
yet
again
thou
shalt
clasp
and
conquer
again
and
yet
again
thou
shalt
let
slip
and
in
the
moment
of
triumph
lose
by
the
snake
s
head
i
swore
my
troth
to
thee
i
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
and
this
i
tell
thee
meriamun
that
as
the
star
shall
shine
and
be
my
beacon
through
the
ages
so
through
the
ages
shall
the
snake
encircle
thee
and
be
thy
doom
hold
said
meriamun
pour
no
more
bitter
words
upon
me
who
am
distraught
of
love
and
was
maddened
by
thy
scorn
wouldst
thou
know
then
why
i
am
come
hither
for
this
cause
i
am
come
to
save
thee
from
thy
doom
hearken
the
time
is
short
it
is
true
though
how
thou
knowest
it
i
may
not
guess
it
is
true
that
the
barbarians
march
on
khem
and
with
them
sails
a
fleet
laden
with
the
warriors
of
thine
own
people
this
also
is
true
pharaoh
has
returned
alone
and
all
his
host
is
swallowed
in
the
sea
of
weeds
and
i
foolish
that
i
am
i
would
save
thee
odysseus
thus
i
will
put
it
in
the
heart
of
pharaoh
to
pardon
thy
great
offence
and
send
thee
forward
against
the
foe
yes
i
can
do
it
but
this
thou
shalt
swear
to
me
to
be
true
to
pharaoh
and
smite
the
barbarian
that
i
will
swear
said
the
wanderer
ay
and
keep
the
oath
though
it
is
hard
to
do
battle
on
my
kin
is
that
all
thy
message
meriamun
not
all
odysseus
one
more
thing
must
thou
swear
or
if
thou
swearest
it
not
here
thou
shalt
surely
die
know
this
she
who
in
khem
is
named
the
hathor
but
who
perchance
has
other
names
hath
put
thee
from
her
because
last
night
thou
wast
wed
to
it
may
well
be
so
said
the
wanderer
she
hath
put
thee
from
her
and
thou
thou
art
bound
to
me
by
that
which
can
not
be
undone
and
by
an
oath
that
may
not
be
broken
in
whatever
shape
i
walk
or
by
whatever
name
i
am
known
among
men
still
thou
art
bound
to
me
as
i
am
bound
to
thee
this
then
thou
shalt
swear
that
thou
wilt
tell
naught
of
last
night
s
tale
to
that
i
swear
said
the
wanderer
also
that
if
pharaoh
be
gathered
to
osiris
and
it
should
chance
that
she
who
is
named
the
hathor
pass
with
him
to
the
underworld
then
that
thou
odysseus
wilt
wed
me
meriamun
and
be
faithful
to
me
for
thy
life
now
the
crafty
odysseus
took
counsel
with
his
heart
and
bethought
him
of
the
words
of
the
goddess
he
saw
that
it
was
in
the
mind
of
meriamun
to
slay
pharaoh
and
the
helen
but
he
cared
nothing
for
the
fate
of
pharaoh
and
knew
well
that
helen
might
not
be
harmed
and
that
though
she
change
eternally
wearing
now
this
shape
and
now
that
yet
she
dies
only
when
the
race
of
men
is
dead
then
to
be
gathered
to
the
number
of
the
gods
this
he
knew
also
that
now
he
must
go
forth
on
his
last
wandering
for
death
should
come
upon
him
from
the
water
therefore
he
answered
readily
that
oath
i
swear
also
meriamun
and
if
i
break
it
may
i
perish
in
shame
and
for
now
meriamun
heard
and
knelt
beside
him
looking
upon
him
with
eyes
of
love
it
is
well
odysseus
perchance
ere
long
i
shall
claim
thy
oath
oh
think
not
so
ill
of
me
if
i
have
sinned
i
have
sinned
from
love
of
thee
long
years
ago
odysseus
thy
shadow
fell
upon
my
heart
and
i
clasped
its
emptiness
now
thou
art
come
and
i
who
pursued
a
shadow
from
sleep
to
sleep
and
dream
to
dream
saw
thee
a
living
man
and
loved
thee
to
my
ruin
then
i
tamed
my
pride
and
came
to
win
thee
to
my
heart
and
the
gods
set
another
shape
upon
me
so
thou
sayest
and
in
that
shape
the
shape
of
her
thou
seekest
thou
didst
make
me
wife
to
thee
perchance
she
and
i
are
odysseus
at
the
least
not
so
readily
had
forsaken
thee
oh
when
thou
didst
stand
in
thy
might
holding
those
dogs
at
bay
till
the
sidonian
knave
cut
thy
bowstring
what
of
him
tell
me
what
of
kurri
this
would
i
ask
thee
queen
that
he
be
laid
where
i
lie
and
die
the
death
to
which
i
am
gladly
would
i
give
thee
the
boon
she
answered
but
thou
askest
too
late
the
false
hathor
looked
upon
him
and
he
slew
himself
now
i
will
away
the
night
wanes
and
pharaoh
must
dream
dreams
ere
dawn
fare
thee
well
odysseus
thy
bed
is
hard
but
soft
is
the
couch
of
kings
that
waits
thee
and
she
went
forth
from
him
ay
meriamun
said
the
wanderer
looking
after
her
hard
is
my
bed
and
soft
is
the
couch
of
the
kings
of
men
that
waits
me
in
the
realms
of
queen
persephone
but
it
is
not
thou
who
shalt
share
it
hard
is
my
bed
harder
shall
thine
be
through
all
the
nights
of
death
that
are
to
come
when
the
erinnyes
work
their
will
on
folk
iv
pharaoh
s
dream
pharaoh
slept
heavily
in
his
place
for
he
was
wearied
with
grief
and
toil
but
meriamun
passed
into
the
chamber
and
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
golden
bed
lifted
up
her
hands
and
by
her
art
called
visions
down
on
pharaoh
false
dreams
through
the
ivory
gate
so
pharaoh
dreamed
and
thus
his
vision
went
he
dreamed
that
he
slept
in
his
bed
and
that
the
statue
of
ptah
the
creator
descended
from
the
pedestal
by
the
temple
gate
and
came
to
him
towering
over
him
like
a
giant
then
he
dreamed
that
he
awoke
and
prostrating
himself
before
the
god
asked
the
meaning
of
his
coming
thereon
the
god
spoke
to
him
meneptah
my
son
whom
i
love
hearken
unto
me
the
barbarians
overrun
the
ancient
land
of
khem
nine
nations
march
up
against
khem
and
lay
it
waste
hearken
unto
me
my
son
and
i
will
give
thee
victory
awake
awake
from
sloth
and
i
will
give
thee
victory
thou
shalt
hew
down
the
barbarians
as
a
countryman
hews
a
rotting
palm
they
shall
fall
and
thou
shalt
spoil
them
but
hearken
unto
me
my
son
thou
shalt
not
thyself
go
up
against
them
low
in
thy
dungeon
there
lies
a
mighty
chief
skilled
in
the
warfare
of
the
barbarians
a
wanderer
who
hath
wandered
far
thou
shalt
release
him
from
his
bonds
and
set
him
over
thy
armies
and
of
the
sin
that
he
has
sinned
thou
shalt
take
no
heed
awake
awake
meneptah
with
this
bow
which
i
give
thee
shalt
thou
smite
the
then
meriamun
laid
the
bow
of
the
wanderer
even
the
black
bow
of
eurytus
on
the
bed
beside
pharaoh
and
passed
thence
to
her
own
chamber
and
the
deceitful
dream
too
passed
away
early
in
the
morning
a
came
to
the
queen
saying
that
pharaoh
would
speak
with
her
she
went
into
the
and
found
him
there
and
in
his
hand
was
the
black
bow
of
eurytus
dost
thou
know
this
weapon
he
asked
yea
i
know
it
she
answered
and
thou
shouldst
know
it
also
for
surely
it
saved
us
from
the
fury
of
the
people
on
the
night
of
the
death
of
the
it
is
the
bow
of
the
wanderer
who
lies
in
the
place
of
torment
and
waits
his
doom
because
of
the
wrong
he
would
have
wrought
upon
if
he
hath
wronged
thee
yet
it
is
he
who
shall
save
khem
from
the
barbarians
said
pharaoh
listen
now
to
the
dream
that
i
have
dreamed
and
he
told
her
all
the
vision
it
is
indeed
evil
that
he
who
would
have
wrought
such
wickedness
upon
me
should
go
forth
honoured
the
first
of
the
host
of
pharaoh
quoth
meriamun
yet
as
the
god
hath
spoken
so
let
it
be
send
now
and
bid
them
loose
the
man
from
the
place
of
torment
and
put
his
armour
on
him
and
bring
him
before
so
pharaoh
went
out
and
the
wanderer
was
loosed
from
his
bed
of
stone
and
clothed
again
in
his
golden
harness
and
came
forth
glorious
to
see
and
stood
before
pharaoh
but
no
arms
were
given
him
then
pharaoh
told
him
all
his
dream
and
why
he
caused
him
to
be
released
from
the
grip
of
the
tormentors
the
wanderer
hearkened
in
silence
saying
no
word
now
choose
thou
wanderer
said
pharaoh
choose
if
thou
wilt
be
borne
back
to
the
bed
of
torment
there
to
die
beneath
the
hands
of
the
tormentors
or
if
thou
wilt
go
forth
as
the
captain
of
my
host
to
do
battle
with
the
barbarians
who
waste
the
land
of
khem
it
seems
there
is
little
faith
in
thine
oaths
therefore
i
ask
no
more
oaths
from
thee
but
this
i
swear
that
if
thou
art
false
to
my
trust
i
will
yet
find
means
to
bring
thee
back
to
that
chamber
whence
thou
wast
led
but
then
the
wanderer
spoke
of
that
charge
pharaoh
which
is
laid
against
me
i
will
say
nothing
though
perchance
if
i
stood
upon
my
trial
for
the
sin
that
is
laid
against
me
i
might
find
words
to
say
thou
askest
no
oath
from
me
and
no
oath
i
swear
yet
i
tell
thee
that
if
thou
givest
me
ten
thousand
soldiers
and
a
hundred
chariots
i
will
smite
these
foes
of
thine
so
that
they
shall
come
no
more
to
khem
ay
though
they
be
of
my
own
people
yet
will
i
smite
them
and
if
i
fail
then
may
those
who
go
with
me
slay
me
and
send
me
down
to
thus
he
spoke
and
as
he
spoke
he
searched
the
hall
with
his
eyes
for
he
desired
to
see
rei
the
priest
and
charge
him
with
a
message
to
helen
but
he
sought
him
in
vain
for
rei
had
fled
and
was
in
hiding
from
the
anger
of
meriamun
then
pharaoh
bade
his
officers
take
the
wanderer
and
set
him
in
a
chariot
and
bear
him
to
the
city
of
on
where
pharaoh
s
host
was
gathering
their
charge
was
to
watch
him
night
and
day
with
uplifted
swords
and
if
he
so
much
as
turned
his
face
from
the
foe
towards
tanis
then
they
should
slay
him
but
when
the
host
of
pharaoh
marched
from
on
to
do
battle
on
the
foe
then
they
should
give
the
wanderer
his
own
sword
and
the
great
black
bow
and
obey
him
in
everything
but
if
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
foe
then
they
should
slay
him
or
if
the
host
of
pharaoh
were
driven
back
by
the
foe
then
they
should
slay
him
the
wanderer
heard
and
smiled
as
a
wolf
smiles
but
spoke
no
word
thereon
the
great
officers
of
pharaoh
took
him
and
led
him
forth
they
set
him
in
a
chariot
and
with
the
chariot
went
a
thousand
horsemen
and
soon
meriamun
watching
from
the
walls
of
tanis
saw
the
long
line
of
desert
dust
that
marked
the
passing
of
the
wanderer
from
the
city
which
he
should
see
no
more
the
wanderer
also
looked
back
on
tanis
with
a
heavy
heart
there
far
away
he
could
see
the
shrine
of
hathor
gleaming
like
crystal
above
the
tawny
flood
of
waters
and
he
must
go
down
to
death
leaving
no
word
for
her
who
sat
in
the
shrine
and
deemed
him
faithless
and
forsworn
evil
was
the
lot
that
the
gods
had
laid
upon
him
and
bitter
was
his
guerdon
his
thoughts
were
sad
enough
while
the
chariot
rolled
towards
the
city
of
on
where
the
host
of
pharaoh
was
gathering
and
the
thunder
of
the
feet
of
horses
echoed
in
his
ears
when
as
he
pondered
it
chanced
that
he
looked
up
there
on
a
knoll
of
sand
before
him
a
from
the
chariot
stood
a
camel
and
on
the
camel
a
man
sat
as
though
he
waited
the
coming
of
the
host
idly
the
wanderer
wondered
who
this
might
be
and
as
he
wondered
the
man
urged
the
camel
towards
the
chariot
and
halting
before
it
cried
hold
in
a
loud
voice
who
art
thou
cried
the
captain
of
the
chariot
who
darest
cry
hold
to
the
host
of
pharaoh
i
am
one
who
have
tidings
of
the
barbarians
the
man
made
answer
from
the
camel
the
wanderer
looked
on
him
he
was
wondrous
little
withered
and
old
moreover
his
skin
was
black
as
though
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
his
clothing
was
as
a
beggar
s
rags
though
the
trappings
of
the
camel
were
of
purple
leather
and
bossed
with
silver
again
the
wanderer
looked
he
knew
him
not
and
yet
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
seemed
familiar
now
the
captain
of
the
chariot
bade
the
driver
halt
the
horses
and
cried
draw
near
and
tell
thy
to
none
will
i
tell
my
tidings
save
to
him
who
shall
lead
the
host
of
pharaoh
let
him
come
down
from
the
chariot
and
speak
with
that
may
not
be
said
the
captain
for
he
was
charged
that
the
wanderer
should
have
speech
with
none
as
thou
wilt
answered
the
aged
man
upon
the
camel
go
then
go
to
thy
doom
thou
art
not
the
first
who
hath
turned
aside
a
messenger
from
the
i
am
minded
to
bid
the
soldiers
shoot
thee
with
arrows
cried
the
captain
in
anger
so
shall
my
wisdom
sink
in
the
sand
with
my
blood
and
be
lost
with
my
breath
shoot
on
thou
now
the
captain
was
perplexed
for
from
the
aspect
of
the
man
he
deemed
that
he
was
sent
by
the
gods
he
looked
at
the
wanderer
who
took
but
little
heed
or
so
it
seemed
but
in
his
crafty
heart
he
knew
that
this
was
the
best
way
to
win
speech
with
the
man
upon
the
camel
then
the
captain
took
counsel
with
the
captain
of
the
horsemen
and
in
the
end
they
said
to
the
wanderer
descend
from
the
chariot
lord
and
walk
twelve
paces
forward
and
there
hold
speech
with
the
man
but
if
thou
go
one
pace
further
then
we
will
shoot
thee
and
the
man
with
and
this
he
cried
out
also
to
him
who
sat
upon
the
camel
then
the
man
on
the
camel
descended
and
walked
twelve
paces
forward
and
the
wanderer
descended
also
from
the
chariot
and
walked
twelve
paces
forward
but
as
one
who
heeds
little
what
he
does
now
the
two
stood
face
to
face
but
out
of
earshot
of
the
host
who
watched
them
with
arrows
set
upon
the
strings
greetings
odysseus
of
ithaca
son
of
laertes
he
said
who
was
clothed
in
the
beggar
s
weeds
the
wanderer
looked
upon
him
hard
and
knew
him
through
his
disguise
greeting
rei
the
priest
commander
of
the
legion
of
amen
chief
of
the
treasury
of
rei
the
priest
i
am
indeed
he
answered
the
rest
i
am
no
more
for
meriamun
the
queen
has
stripped
me
of
my
wealth
and
offices
because
of
thee
thou
wanderer
and
the
immortal
whose
love
thou
hast
won
and
by
whom
thou
hast
dealt
so
hearken
i
learned
by
arts
known
to
me
of
the
dream
of
pharaoh
and
of
thy
sending
forth
to
do
battle
with
the
barbarians
then
i
disguised
myself
as
thou
seest
and
took
the
swiftest
camel
in
tanis
and
am
come
hither
by
another
way
to
meet
thee
now
i
would
ask
thee
one
thing
how
came
it
that
thou
didst
play
the
immortal
false
that
night
knowest
thou
that
she
waited
for
thee
there
by
the
pylon
gate
ay
there
i
found
her
and
led
her
to
the
palace
and
for
that
i
am
stripped
of
my
rank
and
goods
by
meriamun
and
now
the
lady
of
beauty
is
returned
to
her
shrine
grieving
bitterly
for
thy
faithlessness
though
how
she
passed
thither
i
know
methought
i
heard
her
voice
as
those
knaves
bore
me
to
my
dungeon
said
the
wanderer
and
she
deemed
me
faithless
say
rei
dost
thou
know
the
magic
of
meriamun
dost
thou
know
how
she
won
me
to
herself
in
the
shape
of
argive
helen
and
then
in
as
few
words
as
might
be
he
told
rei
how
he
had
been
led
away
by
the
magic
of
meriamun
how
he
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
had
sworn
by
the
snake
when
rei
heard
that
the
wanderer
had
sworn
by
the
snake
he
shuddered
now
i
know
all
he
said
fear
not
thou
wanderer
not
on
thee
shall
all
the
evil
fall
nor
on
that
immortal
whom
thou
dost
love
the
snake
that
beguiled
thee
shall
avenge
thee
rei
the
wanderer
said
one
thing
i
charge
thee
i
know
that
i
go
down
to
my
death
therefore
i
pray
thee
seek
out
her
whom
thou
namest
the
hathor
and
tell
her
all
the
tale
of
how
i
was
betrayed
so
shall
i
die
happily
tell
her
also
that
i
crave
her
forgiveness
and
that
i
love
her
and
her
this
i
will
do
if
i
may
rei
answered
and
now
the
soldiers
murmur
and
i
must
be
gone
listen
the
might
of
the
barbarians
rolls
up
the
eastern
branch
of
sihor
but
one
day
s
march
from
on
the
mountains
run
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
and
those
mountains
are
pierced
by
a
rocky
pass
through
which
the
foe
will
surely
come
set
thou
thy
ambush
there
wanderer
there
at
prosopis
so
shalt
thou
smite
them
farewell
i
will
seek
out
the
hathor
if
in
any
way
i
can
come
at
her
and
tell
her
all
but
of
this
i
warn
thee
the
hour
is
big
with
fate
and
soon
will
spawn
a
monstrous
birth
strange
visions
of
doom
and
death
passed
before
mine
eyes
as
i
slept
last
night
farewell
then
he
went
back
to
the
camel
and
climbed
it
and
passing
round
the
army
vanished
swiftly
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
wanderer
also
went
back
to
the
host
where
the
captains
murmured
because
of
the
halt
and
mounted
his
chariot
but
he
would
tell
nothing
of
what
the
man
had
said
to
him
save
that
he
was
surely
a
messenger
from
the
to
instruct
him
in
the
waging
of
the
war
then
the
chariot
and
the
horsemen
passed
on
again
till
they
came
to
the
city
of
on
and
found
the
host
of
pharaoh
gathering
in
the
great
walled
space
that
is
before
the
temple
of
ra
and
there
they
pitched
their
camp
hard
by
the
great
obelisks
that
stand
at
the
inner
gate
which
rei
the
architect
fashioned
by
thebes
and
the
divine
rameses
miamun
set
up
to
the
glory
of
ra
for
ever
v
the
voice
of
the
dead
when
meriamun
the
queen
had
watched
the
chariot
of
the
wanderer
till
it
was
lost
in
the
dust
of
the
desert
she
passed
down
from
the
palace
roof
to
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
here
she
sat
in
her
chamber
till
the
darkness
gathered
as
the
evil
thoughts
gathered
in
her
heart
that
was
rent
with
love
of
him
whom
she
had
won
but
to
lose
things
had
gone
ill
with
her
to
little
purpose
she
had
sinned
after
such
a
fashion
as
may
not
be
forgiven
yet
there
was
hope
he
had
sworn
that
he
would
wed
her
when
pharaoh
was
dead
and
when
argive
helen
had
followed
pharaoh
to
the
shades
should
she
shrink
then
from
the
deed
of
blood
nay
from
evil
to
evil
she
would
go
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
snake
that
wound
her
about
and
spake
into
the
gloom
osiris
waits
thee
meneptah
osiris
waits
thee
the
shades
of
those
who
have
died
for
thy
love
helen
are
gathering
at
the
gates
it
shall
be
done
pharaoh
thou
diest
night
thou
goddess
helen
shall
all
thy
tale
be
told
may
not
harm
thee
indeed
but
shall
fire
refuse
to
kiss
thy
loveliness
are
there
no
hands
to
light
thy
funeral
pile
then
she
rose
and
calling
her
ladies
was
attired
in
her
most
splendid
robes
and
caused
the
uraeus
crown
to
be
set
upon
her
head
the
snake
circlet
of
power
on
her
brow
the
snake
girdle
of
wisdom
at
her
heart
and
now
she
hid
somewhat
in
her
breast
and
passed
to
the
where
the
princes
gathered
for
the
feast
pharaoh
looked
up
and
saw
her
loveliness
so
glorious
she
seemed
in
her
royal
beauty
that
his
heart
forgot
its
woes
and
once
again
he
loved
her
as
he
had
done
in
years
gone
by
when
she
conquered
him
at
the
game
of
pieces
and
he
had
cast
his
arms
about
her
and
she
stabbed
him
she
saw
the
look
of
love
grow
on
his
heavy
face
and
all
her
gathered
hate
rose
in
her
breast
though
she
smiled
gently
with
her
lips
and
spake
him
fair
they
sat
at
the
feast
and
pharaoh
drank
and
ever
as
he
drank
she
smiled
upon
him
with
her
dark
eyes
and
spake
him
words
of
gentlest
meaning
till
at
length
there
was
nothing
he
desired
more
than
that
they
should
be
at
one
again
now
the
feast
was
done
they
sat
in
the
for
all
were
gone
save
meneptah
and
meriamun
then
he
came
to
her
and
took
her
hand
looking
into
her
eyes
nor
did
she
say
him
nay
there
was
a
lute
lying
on
a
golden
table
and
there
too
as
it
chanced
was
a
board
for
the
game
of
pieces
with
the
dice
and
the
pieces
themselves
wrought
in
gold
pharaoh
took
up
the
gold
king
from
the
board
and
toyed
with
it
in
his
hand
meriamun
he
said
for
these
five
years
we
have
been
apart
thou
and
thy
love
i
have
lost
as
a
game
is
lost
for
one
false
move
or
one
throw
of
the
dice
and
our
child
is
dead
and
our
armies
are
scattered
and
the
barbarians
come
like
flies
when
sihor
stirs
within
his
banks
love
only
is
left
to
us
she
looked
at
him
not
unkindly
as
if
sorrow
and
wrong
had
softened
her
heart
also
but
she
did
not
speak
can
dead
love
waken
meriamun
and
can
angry
love
forgive
she
had
lifted
the
lute
and
her
fingers
touched
listlessly
on
the
cords
nay
i
know
not
she
said
who
knows
how
did
pentaur
sing
of
love
s
renewal
pentaur
the
glorious
minstrel
of
our
father
rameses
miamun
he
laid
the
gold
king
on
the
board
and
began
listlessly
to
cast
the
dice
he
threw
the
hathor
as
it
chanced
the
lucky
cast
two
sixes
and
a
thought
of
better
fortune
came
to
him
how
did
the
song
run
meriamun
it
is
many
a
year
since
i
heard
thee
she
touched
the
lute
lowly
and
sweetly
and
then
she
sang
her
thoughts
were
of
the
wanderer
but
the
king
deemed
that
she
thought
of
himself
o
joy
of
love
s
renewing
could
love
be
born
again
relenting
for
thy
rueing
and
pitying
my
pain
o
joy
of
love
s
awaking
could
love
arise
from
sleep
forgiving
our
forsaking
the
fields
we
would
not
reap
fleet
fleet
we
fly
pursuing
the
love
that
fled
amain
but
will
he
list
our
wooing
or
call
we
but
in
vain
ah
vain
is
all
our
wooing
and
all
our
prayers
are
vain
love
listeth
not
our
suing
love
will
not
wake
again
will
he
not
waken
again
said
pharaoh
if
two
pray
together
will
love
refuse
their
prayer
it
might
be
so
she
said
if
two
prayed
together
for
if
they
prayed
he
would
have
heard
already
meriamun
said
the
pharaoh
eagerly
for
he
thought
her
heart
was
moved
by
pity
and
sorrow
once
thou
didst
win
my
crown
at
the
pieces
wilt
thou
play
me
for
thy
love
she
thought
for
one
moment
and
then
she
said
yes
i
will
play
thee
my
lord
but
my
hand
has
lost
its
cunning
and
it
may
well
be
that
meriamun
shall
lose
again
as
she
has
lost
all
let
me
set
the
pieces
and
bring
wine
for
my
she
set
the
pieces
and
crossing
the
room
she
lifted
a
great
cup
of
wine
and
put
it
by
pharaoh
s
hand
but
he
was
so
intent
on
the
game
that
he
did
not
drink
he
took
the
field
he
moved
she
replied
and
so
the
game
went
between
them
in
the
dark
fragrant
chamber
where
the
lamp
burned
and
the
queen
s
eyes
shone
in
the
night
this
way
and
that
went
the
game
till
she
lost
and
he
swept
the
board
then
in
triumph
he
drained
the
poisoned
cup
of
wine
and
cried
pharaoh
is
dead
pharaoh
is
dead
answered
meriamun
gazing
into
his
eyes
what
is
that
look
in
thine
eyes
meriamun
what
is
that
look
in
thine
eyes
and
the
king
grew
pale
as
the
dead
for
he
had
seen
that
look
before
when
meriamun
slew
hataska
pharaoh
is
dead
she
shrilled
in
the
tone
of
women
who
wail
the
dirges
pharaoh
great
pharaoh
is
dead
ere
a
man
may
count
a
hundred
thy
days
are
numbered
strange
but
meneptah
shalt
thou
sit
where
hataska
sat
dead
on
the
knees
of
death
an
osirian
in
the
lap
of
the
osiris
die
pharaoh
die
but
while
thy
diest
hearken
there
is
one
i
love
the
wanderer
who
leads
thy
hosts
his
love
i
stole
by
arts
known
to
me
and
because
i
stole
it
he
would
have
shamed
me
and
i
accused
him
falsely
in
the
ears
of
men
but
he
comes
again
and
so
sure
as
thou
shalt
sit
on
the
knees
of
osiris
so
surely
shall
he
sit
upon
thy
throne
pharaoh
for
pharaoh
is
dead
he
heard
he
gathered
his
last
strength
he
rose
and
staggered
towards
her
striking
at
the
air
slowly
she
drew
away
while
he
followed
her
awful
to
see
at
length
he
stood
still
he
threw
up
his
hands
and
fell
dead
then
meriamun
drew
near
and
looked
at
him
strangely
behold
the
end
of
pharaoh
she
said
that
then
was
a
king
upon
whose
breath
the
lives
of
peoples
hung
like
a
poised
feather
well
let
him
go
earth
can
spare
him
and
death
is
but
the
richer
by
a
weary
fool
tis
done
and
well
done
would
that
s
task
were
also
done
and
that
helen
lay
as
pharaoh
lies
so
rinse
the
cup
and
now
to
sleep
if
sleep
will
come
ah
where
hath
sleep
flown
of
late
they
ll
find
him
dead
well
what
of
it
so
do
kings
ofttimes
die
there
i
will
be
going
never
were
his
eyes
so
large
and
so
unlovely
now
the
light
of
morning
gathered
again
on
all
the
temple
tops
and
men
rose
from
sleep
to
go
about
their
labours
meriamun
watched
it
grow
as
she
lay
sleepless
in
her
golden
bed
waiting
for
the
cry
that
presently
should
ring
along
the
palace
walls
hark
what
was
that
the
sound
of
swinging
doors
the
rush
of
running
feet
and
now
it
came
long
and
shrill
it
rose
pharaoh
is
dead
awake
awake
ye
sleepers
awake
awake
and
look
upon
that
which
has
come
about
pharaoh
is
dead
pharaoh
is
dead
then
meriamun
arose
and
followed
by
the
ladies
rushed
from
her
chamber
who
dreams
so
evilly
she
said
who
dreams
and
cries
aloud
in
his
haunted
sleep
o
queen
it
is
no
dream
said
one
pass
into
the
and
see
there
lies
pharaoh
dead
and
with
no
wound
upon
him
to
tell
the
manner
of
his
then
meriamun
cried
aloud
with
a
great
cry
and
threw
her
hair
about
her
face
while
tears
fell
from
her
dark
eyes
she
passed
into
the
chamber
and
there
fallen
on
his
back
and
cold
lay
pharaoh
in
his
royal
robes
awhile
the
queen
looked
upon
him
as
one
who
is
dumb
with
grief
then
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
cried
still
is
the
curse
heavy
upon
khem
and
the
people
of
khem
pharaoh
lies
dead
yea
he
is
dead
who
has
no
wound
and
this
i
say
that
he
is
slain
of
the
witchcraft
of
her
whom
men
name
the
hathor
oh
my
lord
my
lord
and
kneeling
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
breast
by
this
dead
heart
of
thine
i
swear
that
i
will
wreak
thy
murder
on
her
who
wrought
it
lift
him
up
lift
up
this
poor
clay
that
was
the
first
of
kings
clothe
him
in
the
robes
of
death
and
set
him
on
the
knees
of
osiris
in
the
temple
of
osiris
then
go
forth
through
the
city
and
call
out
this
the
queen
s
command
call
it
from
street
to
street
this
is
the
queen
s
command
that
every
woman
in
tanis
who
has
lost
son
or
husband
or
brother
or
kin
or
lover
through
the
witchcraft
of
the
false
hathor
or
by
the
plagues
that
she
hath
wrought
on
khem
or
in
the
war
with
the
apura
whom
she
caused
to
fly
from
khem
do
meet
me
at
sundown
in
the
temple
of
osiris
before
the
face
of
the
god
and
of
dead
pharaoh
s
so
they
took
meneptah
the
osirian
and
wrapping
him
in
the
robes
of
death
bore
him
to
the
knees
of
osiris
where
he
should
sit
a
day
and
a
night
and
the
messengers
of
meriamun
went
forth
summoning
the
women
of
the
city
to
meet
her
at
sunset
in
the
temple
of
osiris
moreover
meriamun
sent
out
slaves
by
tens
and
by
twenties
to
the
number
of
two
thousand
bidding
them
gather
up
all
the
wood
that
was
in
tanis
and
all
the
oil
and
the
bitumen
and
bundles
of
reeds
by
hundreds
such
as
are
used
for
the
thatching
of
houses
and
lay
them
in
piles
and
stacks
in
a
certain
courtyard
near
the
temple
of
hathor
this
they
did
and
so
the
day
wore
on
while
the
women
wailed
about
the
streets
because
of
the
death
of
pharaoh
now
it
chanced
that
the
camel
of
rei
the
priest
fell
down
from
weariness
as
it
journeyed
swiftly
back
to
tanis
but
rei
sped
forward
on
foot
and
came
to
the
gates
of
tanis
sorely
wearied
towards
the
evening
of
that
day
when
he
heard
the
wailing
of
the
women
he
asked
of
a
what
new
evil
had
fallen
upon
khem
and
learned
the
death
of
pharaoh
then
rei
knew
by
whose
hand
pharaoh
was
dead
and
grieved
at
heart
because
she
whom
he
had
served
and
loved
meriamun
the
was
a
murderess
at
first
he
was
minded
to
go
up
before
the
queen
and
put
her
to
an
open
shame
and
then
take
his
death
at
her
hands
but
when
he
heard
that
meriamun
had
summoned
all
the
women
of
tanis
to
meet
her
in
the
temple
of
osiris
he
had
another
thought
hurrying
to
that
place
where
he
hid
in
the
city
he
ate
and
drank
then
he
put
off
his
beggar
s
rags
and
robed
himself
afresh
and
over
all
drew
the
garment
of
an
aged
crone
for
this
was
told
him
that
no
man
should
be
suffered
to
enter
the
temple
now
the
day
was
dying
and
already
the
western
sky
was
red
and
he
hurried
forth
and
mingled
with
the
stream
of
women
who
passed
towards
the
temple
gates
who
then
slew
pharaoh
asked
one
and
why
does
the
queen
summon
us
to
meet
her
pharaoh
is
slain
by
the
witchcraft
of
the
false
hathor
answered
another
and
the
queen
summons
us
that
we
may
take
counsel
how
to
be
rid
of
the
tell
not
of
the
accursed
hathor
said
a
third
my
husband
and
my
brother
are
dead
at
her
hands
and
my
son
died
in
the
death
of
the
that
she
called
down
on
khem
ah
if
i
could
but
see
her
rent
limb
from
limb
i
should
seek
osiris
some
there
be
quoth
a
fourth
who
say
that
not
the
hathor
but
the
gods
of
those
apura
brought
the
woes
on
khem
and
some
that
pharaoh
was
slain
by
the
queen
s
own
hand
because
of
the
love
she
bears
to
that
great
wanderer
who
came
here
a
while
thou
fool
answered
the
first
how
can
the
queen
love
one
who
would
have
wrought
outrage
on
her
such
things
have
been
said
the
fourth
woman
perchance
he
wrought
no
outrage
perchance
she
beguiled
him
as
women
may
yes
yes
such
things
have
been
i
am
old
and
i
have
seen
such
yea
thou
art
old
said
the
first
thou
hast
no
child
no
husband
no
father
no
lover
and
no
brother
thou
hast
lost
none
who
are
dear
to
thee
through
the
magic
of
the
hathor
speak
one
more
such
slander
on
the
queen
and
we
will
fall
upon
thee
and
tear
thy
lying
tongue
from
its
hush
said
the
second
woman
here
are
the
temple
gates
by
isis
did
any
ever
see
such
a
multitude
of
women
and
never
a
man
to
cheer
them
a
dreary
sight
indeed
come
push
on
push
on
or
we
shall
find
no
place
yea
thou
soldier
we
are
women
all
women
have
no
fear
no
need
to
bare
our
breasts
look
at
our
eyes
blind
with
weeping
over
the
dead
push
on
push
on
so
they
passed
by
the
guards
and
into
the
gates
of
the
temple
and
with
them
went
rei
unheeded
already
it
was
filled
with
women
although
the
sun
was
not
yet
dead
torches
were
set
about
to
lighten
the
gloom
and
by
them
rei
saw
that
the
curtains
before
the
shrine
were
drawn
presently
the
temple
was
full
to
overflowing
the
doors
were
shut
and
barred
and
a
voice
from
behind
the
veil
cried
then
all
the
multitude
of
women
were
silent
and
the
light
of
the
torches
flared
strangely
upon
their
shifting
upturned
faces
as
fires
flare
over
the
white
now
the
curtains
of
the
shrine
of
osiris
were
drawn
aside
slowly
and
the
light
that
burned
upon
the
altar
streamed
out
between
them
it
fell
upon
the
foremost
ranks
of
women
it
fell
upon
the
polished
statue
of
the
osiris
on
the
knees
of
osiris
sat
the
body
of
pharaoh
meneptah
his
head
resting
against
the
breast
of
the
god
pharaoh
was
wrapped
about
with
winding
clothes
like
the
marble
statue
of
the
god
and
in
his
cold
hands
were
bound
the
crook
the
sceptre
and
the
scourge
as
the
crook
the
sceptre
and
the
scourge
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
effigy
of
the
god
as
was
the
statue
of
the
god
so
was
the
body
of
pharaoh
that
sat
upon
his
knees
and
cold
and
awful
was
the
face
of
osiris
and
cold
and
awful
was
the
face
of
meneptah
the
osirian
at
the
side
and
somewhat
in
front
of
the
statue
of
the
god
a
throne
was
placed
of
blackest
marble
and
on
the
throne
sat
meriamun
the
queen
she
was
glorious
to
look
on
she
wore
the
royal
robes
of
khem
the
of
khem
fashioned
of
gold
and
wreathed
with
the
uraeus
snakes
was
set
upon
her
head
in
her
hand
was
the
crystal
cross
of
life
and
between
her
mantle
s
purple
folds
gleamed
the
eyes
of
her
snake
girdle
she
sat
awhile
in
silence
speaking
no
word
and
all
the
women
wondered
at
her
glory
and
at
dead
pharaoh
s
awfulness
then
at
length
she
spoke
low
indeed
but
so
clearly
that
every
word
reached
the
limits
of
the
temple
hall
women
of
tanis
hear
me
the
queen
let
each
search
the
face
of
each
and
if
there
be
any
man
among
your
multitude
let
him
be
dragged
forth
and
torn
limb
from
limb
for
in
this
matter
no
man
may
hear
our
counsels
lest
following
his
madness
he
betray
now
every
woman
looked
upon
her
neighbour
and
she
who
was
next
to
rei
looked
hard
upon
him
so
that
he
trembled
for
his
life
but
he
crouched
into
the
shadow
and
stared
back
on
her
boldly
as
though
he
doubted
if
she
were
indeed
a
woman
and
said
no
word
when
all
had
looked
and
no
man
had
been
found
meriamun
spoke
again
hearken
women
of
tanis
hearken
to
your
sister
and
your
queen
woe
upon

on
the
head

smitten
the
ancient
land

spoiled
us
and
fled
away
our
hosts

been
swallowed
in
the
sea
of
weeds
and
barbarians
swarm
along
our
shores
like
locusts
is
it
not
so
women
of
tanis

is
so
o

they
answered
as
with
one
voice

strange
evil

fallen
on
the
head
of
khem
a
false
goddess

come
to
dwell
within

great
in
the
land

go
up
to
look
upon
her
deadly
beauty
and
month
by
month
they
are
slain
of
her
sorceries
she
takes
the
husband
from
his
marriage
bed
she
draws
the
lover
from
her
who
waits
to
be
a
bride
the
slave
flies
to
her
from
the
household
of
his
lord
the
priests

to
her
from
the
altars
of
the
gods

the
very
priests
of
isis
flock
forsworn
from
the
altars
of
isis
all
look
upon
her
and
to
each
she
shows
an
altered
loveliness
and
to
all
she
gives
one
guerdon
death
is
it
not
so
women
of
tanis
alas
alas
it
is
so
o
queen
answered
the
women
as
with
one
voice
woes
are
fallen
on
you
and
khem
my
sisters
but
on
me
most
of
all
are
woes
fallen

been
slain

land

land

love
has
been
laid
waste
with
plagues

great
death

been
laid
on
me

on
it

most
beloved
lord

sits
and

my
tears
and
all
my
prayers

not
summon
one
single
answering
sigh
from
that
stilled
heart
the
curse
hath
fallen
on
him
also
he
too
hath
been
smitten
silently
with
everlasting
silence
look
look
ye
who
are
wives
and
weep
with
me
ye
who
are
left
now
the
women
looked
and
a
great
groan
went
up
from
all
that
multitude
while
meriamun
hid
her
face
with
the
hollow
of
her
hand
then
again
she
spoke
i
have
besought
the
gods
my
sisters
i
have
dared
to
call
down
the
majesty
of
the
gods
who
speak
through
the
lips
of
the
dead
and
i
have
learnt
whence
these
woes
come
and
this
i
have
won
by
my
prayers
that
ye
who
suffer
as
i
suffer
shall
learn
whence
they
come
not
from
my
mortal
lips
indeed
but
from
the
lips
of
the
dead
that
speak
with
the
voice
of
the
then
while
the
women
trembled
she
turned
to
the
body
of
pharaoh
which
was
set
upon
the
knees
of
osiris
and
spoke
to
it
dead
pharaoh

in
the
underworld

the
hosts
of

and
be
manifest
through
the
lips
of
him
who
was
great
on
earth
speak
through
his
cold
lips
speak
with
mortal
accents
that
these
people
may
hear
and
understand
by
the
spirit
that
is
in
me
who
am
yet
a

on

speak
who
is
the
source
of
the
woes
of
khem
say
lord
of
the
dead
who
are
the
living
evermore
now
the
flame
on
the
altar
died
away
and
dreadful
silence
fell
upon
the
temple
gloom
fell
upon
the
shrine
and
through
the
gloom
the
golden
crown
of
meriamun
and
the
cold
statue
of
the
osiris
and
the
white
face
of
dead
meneptah
gleamed
faint
and
then
suddenly
the
flame
of
the
altar
flared
as
flares
the
summer
lightning
it
flared
full
on
the
face
of
the
dead
and
lo
the
lips
of
the
dead
moved
and
from
them
came
the
sound
of
mortal
speech
they
spake
in
awful
accents
and
thus
they
spoke
who
was
the
curse
of
achæans
she
who
was
the
doom
of
ilios
she
who
sits
in
the
temple
of
hathor
the
fate
of
man
who
may
not
be
harmed
of
man
she
calls
down
the
wrath
of
the
gods
on
khem
it
is
spoken
the
echo
of
the
awful
words
died
away
in
the
silence
then
fear
took
hold
of
the
multitude
of
women
because
of
the
words
of
the
dead
and
some
fell
upon
their
faces
and
some
covered
their
eyes
with
their
hands
arise
my
sisters
cried
the
voice
of
meriamun
ye
have
heard
not
from
my
lips
but
from
the
lips
of
the
dead
arise
and
let
us
forth
to
the
temple
of
the
hathor
ye
have
heard
who
is
the
fountain
of
our
woes
let
us
forth
and
seal
it
at
its
source
for
ever
of
men
she
may
not
be
harmed
who
is
the
fate
of
men
from
men
we
ask
no
help
for
all
men

her
slaves
and
for
her
beauty
s
sake
all
men
forsake
us
but
we
will
play
the
part
of
men
our
women

milk
shall
freeze
within
our
breasts
we
will
dip
our
tender
hands
in
blood
ay
scourged
by
a
thousand
wrongs
we
will
forget
our
gentleness
and
tear
this
foul
fairness
from
its
home
we
will
burn
the
hathor
s
shrine
with
fire
her
priests
shall
perish
at
the
altar
and
the
beauty
of
the
false
goddess
shall
melt
like
wax
in
the
furnace
of
our
hate
say
will
ye
follow
me
my
sisters
and
wreak
our
shames
upon
the
shameful
one
our
woes
upon
the
spring
of
woe
our
dead
upon
their
murderess
she
ceased
and
then
from
every
woman
s
throat
within
the
great
temple
there
went
up
a
cry
of
rage
fierce
and
shrill
we
will
meriamun
we
will
they
screamed
to
the
hathor
lead
us
to
the
hathor
s
shrine
bring
fire
bring
fire
lead
us
to
the
hathor
s
shrine
vi
the
burning
of
the
shrine
rei
the
priest
saw
and
heard
then
turning
he
stole
away
through
the
maddened
throng
of
women
and
fled
with
what
speed
he
might
from
the
temple
his
heart
was
filled
with
fear
and
shame
for
he
knew
full
well
that
pharaoh
was
dead
not
at
the
hand
of
hathor
but
at
the
hand
of
meriamun
the
queen
whom
he
had
loved
he
knew
well
that
dead
meneptah
spake
not
with
the
voice
of
the
dread
gods
but
with
the
voice
of
the
magic
of
meriamun
who
of
all
women
that
have
been
since
the
days
of
taia
was
the
most
skilled
in
evil
magic
the
lore
of
the
snake
he
knew
also
that
meriamun
would
slay
helen
for
the
same
cause
wherefore
she
had
slain
pharaoh
that
she
might
win
the
wanderer
to
her
arms
while
helen
lived
he
was
not
to
be
won
away
now
rei
was
a
righteous
man
loving
the
gods
and
good
and
hating
evil
and
his
heart
burned
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
woman
that
once
he
cherished
this
he
swore
that
he
would
do
if
time
were
left
to
him
he
would
warn
the
helen
so
that
she
might
fly
the
fire
if
so
she
willed
ay
and
would
tell
her
all
the
wickedness
of
meriamun
her
foe
his
old
feet
stumbled
over
each
other
as
he
fled
till
he
came
to
the
gates
of
the
temple
of
the
hathor
and
knocked
upon
the
gates
what
wouldst
thou
old
crone
asked
the
priest
who
sat
in
the
gates
i
would
be
led
to
the
presence
of
the
hathor
he
answered
no
woman
hath
passed
up
to
look
upon
the
hathor
said
the
priest
that
women
do
not
then
rei
made
a
secret
sign
and
wondering
greatly
that
a
woman
should
have
the
inner
wisdom
the
priest
let
him
pass
he
came
to
the
second
gates
what
wouldst
thou
said
the
priest
who
sat
in
the
gates
i
would
go
up
into
the
presence
of
the
no
woman

willed
to
look
upon
the
hathor
said
the
priest
then
again
rei
made
the
secret
sign
but
still
the
priest
wavered
let
me
pass
thou
foolish
warden
said
rei
i
am
a
messenger
from
the

thou
art
a
mortal
messenger

thou
goest
to
thy
doom
said
the
priest
on
my
head
be
it
answered
rei
and
the
priest
let
him
pass
wondering
now
he
stood
before
the
doors
of
the
alabaster
shrine
that
glowed
with
the
light
within
still
rei
paused
not
only
uttering
a
prayer
that
he
might
be
saved
from
the
unseen
swords
he
lifted
the
latch
of
bronze
and
entered
fearfully
but
none
fell
upon
him
nor
was
he
smitten
of
invisible
spears
before
him
swung
the
curtains
of
tyrian
web
but
no
sound
of
singing
came
from
behind
the
curtains
all
was
silence
in
the
shrine
he
passed
between
the
curtains
and
looked
up
the
sanctuary
it
was
lit
with
many
hanging
lamps
and
by
their
light
he
saw
the
goddess
helen
seated
between
the
pillars
of
her
loom
but
she
wove
no
more
at
the
loom
the
web
of
fate
was
rent
by
the
wanderer
s
hands
and
lay
on
either
side
a
shining
cloth
of
gold
the
goddess
helen
sat
songless
in
her
lonely
shrine
and
on
her
breast
gleamed
the
red
star
of
light
that
wept
the
blood
of
men
her
head
rested
on
her
hand
and
her
heavenly
eyes
of
blue
gazed
emptily
down
the
empty
shrine
rei
drew
near
trembling
though
she
seemed
to
see
him
not
at
all
and
at
last
flung
himself
upon
the
earth
before
her
now
at
length
she
saw
him
and
spoke
in
her
voice
of
music
who
art
thou
that
dares
to
break
in
upon
my
sorrow
she
said
wonderingly
art
thou
indeed
a
woman
come
to
look
on
one
who
by
the
will
of
the
gods
is
each
woman
s
deadliest
foe
then
rei
raised
himself
saying
no
woman

immortal
lady
i

that
aged
priest
who
met
thee
two
nights
gone
by
the
pylon
gates
and
led
thee
to
the
palace
of
pharaoh
and
i
have
dared
to
seek
thy
shrine
to
tell
thee
that
thou
art
in
danger
at
the
hands
of
meriamun
the
queen
and
also
to
give
thee
a
certain
message
with
which
i
am
charged
by
him
who
is
named

now

upon
him
wonderingly
and
spoke

thou
not
but
now
name
me
immortal
rei
how
then
can
i
be
in
danger
who

immortal
and
not
to
be
harmed

hath
no
part
in
me
speak
not
to
me
of
dangers
who
alas
can
never
die
till
everything
is
done
but
tell
me
of
that
faithless
wanderer
whom
i
must
love
with
all
the
womanhood
that
shuts
my
spirit
in
and
all
my
spirit
that
is
clothed
in
womanhood
for

the
gods
withholding
death
have
in
wrath
cursed
me
with
love
to
torment
my
deathlessness
oh
when
i
saw
him
standing
where
now
thou
standest
my
soul
knew
its
other
part
and
i
learned
that
the
curse
i
give
to
others
had
fallen
on
myself
and
yet
was
this
wanderer
not
altogether
faithless
to
thee

and
i
will
tell
thee

on

oh
speak
and

helen
all
that
tale
which
the
wanderer
had
charged
him
to
deliver
in
her
ear
and
keep
no
word
back
he
told
her
how
meriamun
had
beguiled
eperitus
in
her
shape
how
he
had
fallen
in
the
snare
and
sworn
by
the
snake
he
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
he
told
her
how
the
wanderer
had
learned
the
truth
and
learning
it
had
cursed
the
witch
who
wronged
him
how
he
had
been
overcome
by
the
guards
and
borne
to
the
bed
of
torment
how
he
had
been
freed
by
the
craft
of
meriamun
and
how
he
had
gone
forth
to
lead
the
host
of
khem
all
this
he
told
her
swiftly
hiding
naught
while
she
listened
with
eager
ears
truly
she
said
when
all
was
told
truly
thou
art
a
happy
messenger
now
i
forgive
him
all
yet
has
he
sworn
by
the
snake
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
and
because
of
his
fault
never
in
this
space
of
life
shall
helen
call
him
lord
yet
will
we
follow
him
rei
hark
what
is
that
again
it

that
long
shrill
cry

of
ghosts

the
queen

with
all
women
of
tanis

the
wanderer

her
arms

with
the
crowd
there
thou

await
my
coming
and
when

near
fearing
nothing

down
the
path
of
the
wanderer
in
such
fashion

those
who

and

without

doors
of

shrine

priests
were
gathered

cried
i

all
the
women
of

world

mad
indeed
said
rei
and
sped
on
he
passed
the
gates
the
gates
clashed
behind
him
he
won
the
outer
space
and
hiding
in
the
shadows
of
the
temple
walls
looked
forth
the
night
was
dark
but
from
every
side
a
thousand
lights
poured
down
towards
the
shrine
on
they
came
like
lanterns
on
the
waters
of
sihor
at
the
night
of
the
feast
of
lanterns
now
he
could
see
their
host
it
was
the
host
of
the
women
of
tanis
and
every
woman
bore
a
lighted
torch
they
came
by
tens
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
and
before
them
was
meriamun
seated
in
a
golden
chariot
and
with
them
were
asses
oxen
and
camels
laden
with
bitumen
wood
and
reeds
now
they
gained
the
gates
and
now
they
crashed
them
in
with
battering
trees
of
palm
the
gates
fell
the
women
poured
through
them
at
their
head
went
meriamun
the
queen
bidding
certain
of
them
stay
by
her
chariot
she
passed
through
and
standing
at
the
inner
gates
called
aloud
to
the
priests
to
throw
them
wide
who
art
thou
who
darest
come
up
with
fire
against
the
holy
temple
of
the
hathor
asked
the
guardian
of
the
gates
i
am
meriamun
the
queen
of
khem
she
answered
come
with
the
women
of
tanis
to
slay
the
witch
thou
guardest
throw
the
gates
wide
or
die
with
the
if
indeed
thou
art
the
queen
answered
the
priest
here
there
sits
a
greater
queen
than
thou
go
back
go
back
meriamun
who
art
not
afraid
to
offer
violence
to
the
immortal
gods
go
back
lest
the
curse
smite
draw
on
draw
on
ye
women
cried
meriamun
draw
on
smite
down
the
gates
and
tear
these
wicked
ones
limb
from
then
the
women
screamed
aloud
and
battered
on
the
gates
with
trees
so
that
they
fell
they
fell
and
the
women
rushed
in
madly
they
seized
the
priests
of
hathor
and
tore
them
limb
from
limb
as
dogs
tear
a
wolf
now
the
shrine
stood
before
them
touch
not
the
doors
cried
meriamun
bring
fire
and
burn
the
shrine
with
her
who
dwells
therein
touch
not
the
doors
look
not
in
the
witch
s
face
but
burn
her
where
she
is
with
then
the
women
brought
the
reeds
and
the
wood
and
piled
them
around
the
shrine
to
twice
the
height
of
a
man
they
brought
ladders
also
and
piled
the
fuel
upon
the
roof
of
the
shrine
till
all
was
covered
and
they
poured
pitch
over
the
fuel
and
then
at
the
word
of
meriamun
they
cast
torches
on
the
pitch
and
drew
back
screaming
for
a
moment
the
torches
smouldered
then
suddenly
on
every
side
great
tongues
of
flame
leapt
up
to
heaven
now
the
shrine
was
wrapped
in
fire
and
yet
they
cast
fuel
on
it
till
none
might
draw
near
because
of
the
heat
now
it
burned
as
a
furnace
burns
and
now
the
fire
reached
the
fuel
on
the
roof
it
caught
and
the
shrine
was
but
a
sheet
of
raging
flame
that
lit
the
city
and
the
broad
face
of
the
waters
as
the
sun
lights
the
lands
the
alabaster
walls
of
the
shrine
turned
whiter
yet
with
heat
they
cracked
and
split
till
the
fabric
tottered
to
its
fall
now
there
is
surely
an
end
of
the
witch
cried
meriamun
and
the
women
screamed
an
answer
to
her
but
even
as
they
screamed
a
great
tongue
of
flame
shot
out
through
the
molten
doors
ten
fathoms
length
and
more
it
shot
like
a
spear
of
fire
full
in
its
path
stood
a
group
of
the
burners
it
struck
them
it
licked
them
up
and
lo
they
fell
in
blackened
heaps
upon
the
ground
rei
looked
down
the
path
of
the
flame
there
in
the
doorway
whence
it
had
issued
stood
the
golden
hathor
wrapped
round
with
fire
and
the
molten
metal
of
the
doors
crept
about
her
feet
there
she
stood
in
the
heart
of
the
fire
but
there
was
no
stain
of
fire
on
her
nor
on
her
white
robes
nor
on
her
streaming
hair
and
even
through
the
glow
of
the
furnace
he
saw
the
light
of
the
red
star
at
her
breast
the
flame
licked
her
form
and
face
it
wrapped
itself
around
her
and
curled
through
the
masses
of
her
hair
but
still
she
stood
unharmed
while
the
burners
shrank
back
amazed
all
save
meriamun
the
queen
and
as
she
stood
she
sang
wild
and
sweet
and
the
sound
of
her
singing
came
through
the
roar
of
the
flames
and
reached
the
ears
of
the
women
who
forgetting
their
rage
clung
to
one
another
in
fear
thus
she
sang
of
that
beauty
which
men
seek
in
all
women
and
never
find
and
of
the
eternal
war
for
her
sake
between
the
women
and
the
men
which
is
the
great
war
of
the
world
and
thus
her
song
ended
will
ye
bring
flame
to
burn
my
shrine
who
am
myself
a
flame
bring
death
to
tame
this
charm
of
mine
that
death
can
never
tame
will
ye
bring
fire
to
harm
my
head
who
am

while

then
still
singing
she
stepped
forward
from
the
shrine
and
as
she
went
the
walls
fell
in
and
the
roof
crashed
down
upon
the
ruin
and
the
flames
shot
up
into
the
very
sky
helen
heeded
it
not
she
looked
not
back
but
out
to
the
gates
beyond
she
glanced
not
at
the
fierce
blackened
faces
of
the
women
nor
on
the
face
of
meriamun
who
stood
before
her
but
slowly
passed
towards
the
gates
nor
did
she
go
alone
for
with
her
came
a
canopy
of
fire
hedging
her
round
with
flame
that
burned
from
nothing
the
women
saw
the
wonder
and
fell
down
in
their
fear
covering
their
eyes
meriamun
alone
fell
not
but
she
too
must
cover
her
eyes
because
of
the
glory
of
helen
and
the
fierceness
of
the
flame
that
wrapped
her
round
now
helen
ceased
singing
but
moved
slowly
through
the
courts
till
she
came
to
the
outer
gates
here
by
the
gates
was
the
chariot
of
meriamun
then
helen
called
aloud
and
the
queen
who
followed
heard
her
words
rei
she
cried
draw
nigh
and
have
no
fear
draw
nigh
that
i
may
pass
with
thee
down
that
path
the
wanderer
treads
draw
nigh
and
let
us
swiftly
hence
for
the
hero
s
last
battle
is
at
hand
and
i
would
greet
him
ere
he
rei
heard
her
and
drew
near
trembling
tearing
from
him
the
woman
s
weeds
he
wore
and
showing
the
priest
s
garb
beneath
and
as
he
came
the
fire
that
wrapped
her
glory
round
left
her
and
passed
upward
like
a
cloak
of
flame
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
saying
lead
me
to
yonder
chariot
rei
and
let
us
then
he
led
her
to
the
chariot
while
those
who
stood
by
fled
in
fear
she
mounted
the
chariot
and
he
set
himself
beside
her
then
he
grasped
the
reins
and
called
to
the
horses
and
they
bounded
forward
and
were
lost
in
the
night
but
meriamun
cried
in
her
wrath
the
witch
is
gone
gone
with
my
own
servant
whom
she
hath
led
astray
bring
chariots
and
let
horsemen
come
with
the
chariots
for
where
she
passes
there
i
will
follow
ay
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
coast
of
vii
the
last
fight
of
odysseus
laertes
son
now
the
host
of
pharaoh
marched
forth
from
on
to
do
battle
with
the
barbarians
and
before
the
host
marched
the
captains
came
to
the
wanderer
according
to
the
command
of
pharaoh
and
placing
their
hands
in
his
swore
to
do
his
bidding
on
the
march
and
in
the
battle
they
brought
him
the
great
black
bow
of
eurytus
and
his
keen
sword
of
bronze
euryalus
gift
and
many
a
sheaf
of
arrows
and
his
heart
rejoiced
when
he
saw
the
goodly
weapon
he
took
the
bow
and
tried
it
and
as
he
drew
the
string
once
again
and
for
the
last
time
it
sang
shrilly
of
death
to
be
the
captains
heard
the
song
of
the
bow
though
what
it
said
the
wanderer
knew
alone
for
to
their
ears
it
came
but
as
a
faint
keen
cry
like
the
cry
of
one
who
drowns
in
the
water
far
from
the
kindly
earth
but
they
marvelled
much
at
the
wonder
and
said
one
to
another
that
this
man
was
no
mortal
but
a
god
come
from
the
then
the
wanderer
mounted
the
chariot
of
bronze
that
had
been
made
ready
for
him
and
gave
the
word
to
march
all
night
the
host
marched
swiftly
and
at
they
camped
beneath
the
shelter
of
a
long
low
hill
but
at
the
sunrise
the
wanderer
left
the
host
climbed
the
hill
with
certain
of
the
captains
and
looked
forth
before
him
was
a
great
pass
in
the
mountains
ten
furlongs
or
more
in
length
and
through
it
ran
the
road
the
sides
of
the
mountain
sloped
down
to
the
road
and
were
strewn
with
rocks
split
by
the
sun
polished
by
the
sand
and
covered
over
with
bush
that
grew
sparsely
like
the
hair
on
the
limbs
of
a
man
to
the
left
of
the
mountains
lay
the
river
sihor
but
none
might
pass
between
the
mountain
and
the
river
the
wanderer
descended
from
the
hill
and
while
the
soldiers
ate
drove
swiftly
in
his
chariot
to
the
further
end
of
the
pass
and
looked
forth
again
here
the
river
curved
to
the
left
leaving
a
wide
plain
and
on
the
plain
he
saw
the
host
of
the
barbarians
the
mightiest
host
that
ever
his
eyes
had
looked
upon
they
were
encamped
by
nations
and
of
each
nation
there
was
twenty
thousand
men
and
beyond
the
glittering
camp
of
the
barbarians
he
saw
the
curved
ships
of
the
achæans
they
were
drawn
up
on
the
beach
of
the
great
river
as
many
a
year
ago
he
had
seen
them
drawn
up
on
the
shore
that
is
by
ilios
he
looked
upon
plain
and
pass
on
mountain
and
river
and
measured
the
number
of
the
foe
then
his
heart
was
filled
with
the
lust
of
battle
and
his
warlike
cunning
awoke
for
of
all
leaders
he
was
the
most
skilled
in
the
craft
of
battle
and
he
desired
that
this
his
last
war
should
be
the
greatest
war
of
all
turning
his
horses
heads
he
galloped
back
to
the
host
of
pharaoh
and
mustered
them
in
battle
array
it
was
but
a
little
number
as
against
the
number
of
the
barbarians
twelve
thousand
spearmen
nine
thousand
archers
two
thousand
horsemen
and
three
hundred
chariots
the
wanderer
passed
up
and
down
their
ranks
bidding
them
be
of
good
courage
for
this
day
they
should
sweep
the
barbarians
from
the
land
as
he
spoke
a
hawk
flew
down
from
the
right
and
fell
on
a
heron
and
slew
it
in
the
host
shouted
for
the
hawk
is
the
holy
bird
of
ra
and
the
wanderer
too
rejoiced
in
the
omen
look
men
he
cried
the
bird
of
ra
has
slain
the
wandering
thief
from
the
waters
and
so
shall
ye
smite
the
spoilers
from
the
then
he
held
counsel
with
captains
and
certain
trusty
men
were
sent
out
to
the
camp
of
the
barbarians
and
they
were
charged
to
give
an
ill
report
of
the
host
of
pharaoh
and
to
say
that
such
of
it
as
remained
awaited
the
barbarian
onset
behind
the
shelter
of
the
hill
on
the
further
side
of
the
pass
then
the
wanderer
summoned
the
captains
of
the
archers
and
bade
them
hide
all
their
force
among
the
rocks
and
thorns
on
either
side
of
the
mountain
pass
and
there
to
wait
till
he
drew
the
hosts
of
the
foe
into
the
pass
and
with
the
archers
he
sent
a
part
of
the
spearmen
but
the
chariots
he
hid
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
hill
on
the
hither
side
of
the
pass
now
when
the
ambush
was
set
and
all
were
gone
save
the
horsemen
only
his
spies
came
in
and
told
him
that
the
host
of
the
barbarians
marched
from
their
camp
but
that
the
achæans
marched
not
but
stopped
by
the
river
to
guard
the
camp
and
ships
then
the
wanderer
bade
the
horsemen
ride
through
the
pass
and
stand
in
the
plain
beyond
and
there
await
the
foe
but
when
the
hosts
of
the
barbarians
charged
them
they
must
reel
before
the
charge
and
at
length
fly
headlong
down
the
pass
as
though
in
fear
and
he
himself
would
lead
the
flight
in
his
chariot
and
where
he
led
there
they
should
follow
so
the
horsemen
rode
through
the
pass
and
formed
their
squadrons
on
the
plain
beyond
now
the
foe
drew
nigh
and
a
glorious
sight
it
was
to
see
the
midday
sun
sparkling
on
their
countless
spears
of
horsemen
they
had
no
great
number
but
there
were
many
chariots
and
swordsmen
and
spearmen
and
slingers
beyond
count
they
came
on
by
nations
and
in
the
centre
of
the
host
of
each
nation
sat
the
king
of
the
nation
in
a
glorious
chariot
with
girls
and
eunuchs
holding
fans
to
fan
him
with
and
awnings
of
silk
to
hide
him
from
the
sun
now
the
wanderer
hung
back
behind
the
squadrons
of
horsemen
as
though
in
fear
but
presently
he
sent
messengers
bidding
the
captains
of
the
squadrons
to
charge
the
first
nation
and
fight
for
a
while
but
feebly
and
then
when
they
saw
him
turn
his
horses
and
gallop
through
the
pass
to
follow
after
him
as
though
in
doubt
but
in
such
fashion
as
to
draw
the
foe
upon
their
heels
this
the
captains
of
the
mercenaries
did
once
they
charged
and
were
beaten
back
then
they
charged
again
but
the
men
made
as
though
they
feared
the
onset
now
the
foe
came
hard
after
them
and
the
wanderer
turned
his
chariot
and
fled
through
the
pass
followed
slowly
by
the
horsemen
and
when
the
hosts
of
the
barbarians
saw
them
turn
they
set
up
a
mighty
shout
of
laughter
that
rent
the
skies
and
charged
after
them
but
the
wanderer
looked
back
and
laughed
also
now
he
was
through
the
pass
followed
by
the
horsemen
and
after
them
swept
the
hosts
of
the
barbarians
like
a
river
that
has
burst
its
banks
still
the
wanderer
held
his
hand
till
the
whole
pass
was
choked
with
the
thousands
of
the
foe
ay
until
the
half
of
the
first
of
the
nations
had
passed
into
the
narrow
plain
that
lay
between
the
hill
and
the
mouth
of
the
pass
then
driving
apace
up
the
hill
he
stood
in
his
chariot
and
gave
the
signal
lifting
his
golden
shield
on
high
he
flashed
it
thrice
and
all
the
horsemen
shouted
aloud
at
the
first
flash
behold
from
behind
every
rock
and
bush
of
the
mountain
sides
arose
the
helms
of
armed
men
at
the
second
flash
there
came
a
rattling
sound
of
shaken
quivers
and
at
the
third
flash
of
the
golden
shield
the
air
was
darkened
with
the
flight
of
arrows
as
the
on
a
lonely
isle
awake
at
the
cry
of
the
sailor
and
wheel
by
thousands
from
their
lofty
cliffs
so
at
the
third
flash
of
the
wanderer
s
shield
the
arrows
of
his
hidden
host
rushed
downward
on
the
foe
rattling
like
hail
upon
the
harness
for
awhile
they
kept
their
ranks
and
pressed
on
over
the
bodies
of
those
that
fell
but
soon
the
horses
in
the
chariots
maddened
with
wounds
plunged
this
way
and
that
breaking
their
companies
and
trampling
the
soldiers
down
now
some
strove
to
fly
forward
and
some
were
fain
to
fly
back
and
many
an
empty
chariot
was
dragged
this
way
and
that
but
ever
the
pitiless
rain
of
shafts
poured
down
and
men
fell
by
thousands
beneath
the
gale
of
death
now
the
mighty
host
of
the
rolled
back
thinned
and
shattered
towards
the
plain
and
now
the
wanderer
cried
the
word
of
onset
to
the
horsemen
and
to
the
chariots
that
drew
from
behind
the
shelter
of
the
hill
and
following
after
him
they
charged
down
upon
those
barbarians
who
had
passed
the
ambush
singing
the
song
of
pentaur
as
they
charged
among
those
nigh
the
mouth
of
the
pass
was
the
king
of
the
nation
of
the
libu
a
great
man
black
and
terrible
to
see
the
wanderer
drew
his
bow
the
arrow
rushed
forth
and
pierced
the
king
and
he
fell
dead
in
his
chariot
then
those
of
his
host
who
passed
the
ambush
turned
to
fly
but
the
chariot
of
the
wanderer
dashed
into
them
and
after
the
chariot
came
the
horsemen
and
after
the
horsemen
the
chariots
of
pharaoh
now
all
who
were
left
of
the
broken
host
rolled
back
mad
with
fear
while
the
spearmen
of
pharaoh
galled
them
as
hunters
gall
a
flying
bull
and
the
horsemen
of
pharaoh
trampled
them
beneath
their
feet
red
slaughter
raged
all
down
the
pass
helms
banners
shone
and
fell
in
the
stream
of
the
tide
of
war
but
at
length
the
stony
way
was
clear
save
for
the
dead
alone
beyond
the
pass
the
plain
was
black
with
flying
men
and
the
fragments
of
the
broken
nations
were
mixed
together
as
clay
and
sand
are
mixed
of
the
potter
where
now
were
the
hosts
of
the
barbarians
where
now
were
their
glory
and
their
pride
the
wanderer
gathered
his
footmen
and
his
chariots
and
set
them
in
array
again
but
the
horsemen
he
sent
out
to
smite
the
flying
nations
and
wait
his
coming
by
the
camp
for
there
were
mustering
those
who
were
left
of
the
nations
perchance
twenty
thousand
men
and
before
their
ships
were
ranged
the
dense
ranks
of
the
achæans
shield
to
shield
every
man
in
his
place
the
wanderer
led
his
host
slowly
across
the
sandy
plain
till
at
length
he
halted
it
two
from
the
camp
of
the
barbarians
the
camp
was
shaped
like
a
bow
and
the
river
sihor
formed
its
string
and
round
it
was
a
deep
ditch
and
beyond
the
ditch
a
wall
of
clay
moreover
within
the
camp
and
nearer
to
the
shore
there
was
a
second
ditch
and
wall
and
behind
it
were
the
beaks
of
the
ships
and
the
host
of
aquaiusha
even
of
his
own
dear
people
the
achæans
there
were
the
old
blazons
and
the
spears
that
had
fought
below
troy
town
there
were
the
two
lions
of
mycenæ
the
centaur
of
the
son
of
polypaetas
son
of
pirithous
there
were
the
swan
of
lacedæmon
and
the
bull
of
the
kings
of
crete
the
rose
of
rhodes
the
serpent
of
athens
and
many
another
knightly
bearing
of
old
friends
and
kindred
dear
and
now
they
were
the
blazons
of
foemen
and
the
wanderer
warred
for
a
strange
king
and
for
his
own
hand
beneath
the
wings
of
the
hawk
of
the
legion
of
ra
the
wanderer
sent
heralds
forward
calling
to
those
barbarians
who
swarmed
behind
the
wall
to
surrender
to
the
host
of
pharaoh
but
this
being
entrenched
by
the
river
sihor
they
would
in
nowise
do
for
they
were
mad
because
of
their
slaughtered
thousands
and
moreover
they
knew
that
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
live
as
slaves
this
they
saw
also
that
their
host
was
still
as
strong
as
the
host
of
pharaoh
which
was
without
the
wall
and
weary
with
the
heat
and
stress
of
battle
and
the
toil
of
marching
through
the
desert
sands
now
the
captains
of
the
host
of
pharaoh
came
to
the
wanderer
praying
him
that
he
would
do
no
more
battle
on
that
day
because
the
men
were
weary
and
the
horses
neighed
for
food
and
water
but
he
answered
them
i
swore
to
pharaoh
that
i
would
utterly
smite
the
people
of
the
and
drive
them
down
to
death
so
that
the
coasts
of
khem
may
be
free
of
them
here
i
may
not
camp
the
host
without
food
or
pasture
for
the
horses
and
if
i
go
back
the
foe
will
gather
heart
and
come
on
and
with
them
the
fleet
of
the
achæans
and
no
more
shall
we
lure
them
into
ambush
for
therein
they
have
learned
a
lesson
nay
get
you
to
your
companies
i
will
go
up
against
the
then
they
bowed
and
went
for
having
seen
his
deeds
and
his
skill
and
craft
in
war
they
held
him
the
first
of
captains
and
dared
not
say
him
nay
so
the
wanderer
divided
his
host
into
three
parts
set
it
in
order
of
battle
and
moved
up
against
the
camp
but
he
himself
went
with
the
centre
part
against
the
gate
of
the
camp
for
here
there
was
an
earthen
way
for
chariots
if
but
the
great
gates
might
be
passed
and
at
a
word
the
threefold
host
rushed
on
to
the
charge
but
those
within
the
walls
shot
them
with
spears
and
arrows
so
that
many
were
slain
and
they
were
rolled
back
from
the
wall
as
a
wave
is
rolled
from
the
cliff
again
the
wanderer
bade
them
charge
on
the
right
and
left
bearing
the
dead
before
them
as
shields
and
hurling
corpses
into
the
ditch
to
fill
it
but
he
himself
hung
back
awhile
with
the
middle
army
watching
how
the
battle
went
and
waiting
till
the
foe
at
the
gate
should
be
drawn
away
now
the
mercenaries
of
pharaoh
forced
a
passage
on
the
right
and
thither
went
many
of
the
barbarians
who
watched
the
gate
that
they
might
drive
them
back
then
the
wanderer
bade
men
take
out
the
poles
of
chariots
and
follow
him
and
beat
down
the
gates
with
the
poles
this
with
much
toil
and
loss
they
did
for
the
archers
poured
their
arrows
on
the
assailants
of
the
gate
now
at
length
the
gates
were
down
and
the
wanderer
rushed
through
them
with
his
chariot
but
even
as
he
passed
the
mercenaries
of
pharaoh
were
driven
out
from
the
camp
on
the
right
and
those
who
led
the
left
attack
fled
also
the
soldiers
who
should
have
followed
the
wanderer
saw
and
wavered
a
little
moment
and
while
they
wavered
the
companies
of
the
barbarians
poured
into
the
gateway
and
held
it
so
that
none
might
pass
now
the
wanderer
was
left
alone
within
the
camp
and
back
he
might
not
go
but
fear
came
not
nigh
him
nay
the
joy
of
battle
filled
his
mighty
heart
he
cast
his
shield
upon
the
brazen
floor
of
the
chariot
and
cried
aloud
to
the
charioteer
as
he
loosened
the
long
grey
shafts
in
his
quiver
drive
on
thou
charioteer
drive
on
the
jackals
leave
the
lion
in
the
toils
drive
on
drive
on
and
win
a
glorious
death
for
thus
should
odysseus
so
the
charioteer
praying
to
his
gods
lashed
the
horses
with
his
scourge
and
they
sprang
forward
madly
among
the
foe
and
as
they
rushed
the
great
bow
rang
and
sang
the
swallow
string
rung
the
bow
and
sung
the
string
and
the
lean
shaft
drank
the
blood
of
a
leader
of
men
again
the
string
sang
again
the
shaft
sped
forth
and
a
barbarian
king
fell
from
his
chariot
as
a
diver
plunges
into
the
sea
and
his
teeth
bit
the
sand
dive
deep
thou
cried
the
wanderer
thou
mayest
find
treasures
there
drive
on
thou
charioteer
so
should
lions
die
while
jackals
now
the
barbarians
looked
on
the
wanderer
and
were
amazed
for
ever
his
chariot
rushed
to
and
fro
across
the
mustering
ground
of
the
camp
and
ever
his
grey
shafts
carried
death
before
them
and
ever
the
foemen
s
arrows
fell
blunted
from
his
golden
harness
they
looked
on
him
amazed
they
cried
aloud
that
this
was
the
god
of
war
come
down
to
do
battle
for
khem
that
it
was
sutek
the
splendid
that
it
was
baal
in
his
strength
they
fled
amain
before
his
glory
and
his
might
for
the
wanderer
raged
among
them
like
great
rameses
miamun
among
the
tribes
of
the
khita
like
monthu
the
lord
of
battles
and
lo
they
fled
before
him
their
knees
gave
way
their
hearts
were
turned
to
water
he
drove
them
as
a
herdsman
drives
the
yearling
calves
but
now
at
length
a
stone
from
a
sling
smote
the
charioteer
who
directed
the
chariot
and
sunk
in
between
his
eyes
so
that
he
fell
down
dead
from
the
chariot
then
the
reins
flew
wide
and
the
horses
rushed
this
way
and
that
having
no
master
and
now
a
spear
pierced
the
heart
of
the
horse
on
the
right
so
that
he
fell
and
the
pole
of
the
chariot
snapped
in
two
then
the
barbarians
took
heart
and
turned
and
some
of
them
set
on
to
seize
the
body
of
the
charioteer
and
spoil
his
arms
but
the
wanderer
leaped
down
and
bestrode
the
corpse
with
shield
up
and
spear
aloft
now
among
the
press
of
the
barbarians
there
was
a
stir
as
of
one
thrusting
his
way
through
them
to
the
front
and
above
the
plumes
of
their
helmets
and
the
tossing
of
their
shields
the
wanderer
saw
the
golden
head
unhelmeted
of
a
man
taller
than
the
tallest
there
from
the
shoulders
upwards
unhelmeted
he
came
and
unshielded
with
no
body
armour
his
flesh
was
very
fair
and
white
and
on
it
were
figures
pricked
in
blue
figures
of
men
and
horses
snakes
and
the
skin
of
a
white
bear
was
buckled
above
his
shoulder
with
a
golden
clasp
fashioned
in
the
semblance
of
a
boar
his
eyes
were
blue
fierce
and
shining
and
in
his
hand
he
held
for
a
weapon
the
trunk
of
a
young
in
which
was
hafted
a
weighty
of
rough
unpolished
stone
give
way
he
cried
give
place
ye
dusky
dwarfs
and
let
a
man
see
this
champion
so
the
barbarians
made
a
circle
about
the
wanderer
and
the
giant
and
stood
silently
to
watch
a
great
fight
who
art
thou
said
the
mighty
man
disdainfully
and
whence
where
is
thy
city
and
thy
parents
who
begat
thee
now
i
will
avow
that
men
call
me
odysseus
sacker
of

laertes
son
a

of

achæans
said
the
wanderer
and
who
art
thou
i
pray
thee
and
where
is
thy
native
place
for
city
i
wot
thou
hast
none
then
the
mighty
man
swinging
his
great
stone
axe
in
a
rhythmic
motion
began
to
chant
a
rude
lay
and
this
was
the
manner
of
the
singing
laestrygons
men
and
cimmerians
call
us
born
of
the
land
of
the
sunless

gold
with
that
and
with
a
cry
he
rushed
on
the
wanderer
his
great
axe
swung
aloft
to
fell
him
at
a
blow
but
while
the
giant
had
been
singing
the
wanderer
had
shifted
his
place
a
little
so
that
the
red
blaze
of
the
setting
sun
was
in
his
face
and
as
the
mighty
man
came
on
the
wanderer
lifted
up
his
golden
shield
and
caught
the
sunlight
on
it
and
flashed
it
full
in
the
giant
s
eyes
so
that
he
was
dazzled
and
could
not
see
to
strike
then
the
wanderer
smote
at
his
naked
right
arm
and
struck
it
on
the
joint
of
the
elbow
with
all
his
force
he
smote
and
the
short
sword
of
euryalus
bit
deep
and
the
arm
fell
with
the
axe
in
the
but
so
terrible
was
the
stroke
that
bronze
might
not
abide
it
and
the
blade
was
shattered
from
the
ivory
handle
didst
thou
feel
aught
thou
cried
odysseus
jeering
for
he
knew
from
the
song
of
the
giant
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
wanderer
from
an
evil
race
that
of
old
had
smitten
his
ships
and
devoured
his
men
the
laestrygons
of
the
land
of
the
midnight
sun
the
but
the
giant
caught
up
his
club
of
in
his
left
hand
the
severed
right
arm
still
clinging
to
it
and
he
gnawed
on
the
handle
of
the
stone
axe
with
his
teeth
and
bit
the
very
stone
and
his
lips
foamed
for
a
fury
came
upon
him
roaring
aloud
suddenly
he
smote
at
the
wanderer
s
head
and
beat
down
his
shield
and
crushed
his
golden
helm
so
that
he
fell
on
one
knee
and
all
was
darkness
around
him
but
his
hands
lit
on
a
great
stone
for
the
place
where
they
fought
was
the
holy
place
of
an
ancient
temple
old
and
ruined
before
king
mena
s
day
he
grasped
the
stone
with
both
hands
it
was
the
basalt
head
of
a
fallen
statue
of
a
god
or
a
man
of
a
king
long
nameless
or
of
a
forgotten
god
with
a
mighty
strain
the
wanderer
lifted
it
as
he
rose
it
was
a
weight
of
a
chariot
s
burden
and
poising
it
he
hurled
it
straight
at
the
breast
of
the
laestrygon
who
had
drawn
back
whirling
his
axe
before
he
smote
another
blow
but
ere
ever
the
stroke
fell
the
huge
stone
struck
him
full
and
broke
in
his
breast
bone
and
he
staggered
long
and
fell
like
a
tree
and
the
black
blood
came
up
through
his
bearded
lips
and
his
life
left
him
then
the
multitude
of
the
barbarians
that
stood
gazing
at
the
fray
drew
yet
further
back
in
fear
and
the
wanderer
laughed
like
a
god
at
that
old
score
paid
and
at
the
last
great
stroke
of
the
hands
of
the
odysseus
viii
till
odysseus
comes
the
wanderer
laughed
like
a
god
though
he
deemed
that
the
end
was
near
and
the
foes
within
the
camp
and
the
friends
without
looked
on
him
and
wondered
slay
him
cried
the
foes
within
speaking
in
many
tongues
slay
him
they
cried
and
yet
they
feared
the
task
but
circled
round
like
hounds
about
a
mighty
boar
at
bay
spare
him
shouted
the
host
of
the
achæans
watching
the
fray
from
far
as
they
stood
behind
their
inner
wall
for
as
yet
they
had
not
mingled
in
the
battle
but
stayed
by
their
ships
to
guard
them
rescue
cried
the
captains
of
pharaoh
without
but
none
came
on
to
force
the
way
then
of
a
sudden
as
fate
hung
upon
the
turn
a
great
cry
of
fear
and
wonder
rose
from
the
ranks
of
pharaoh
s
host
beyond
the
wall
it
swelled
and
swelled
till
at
length
the
cry
took
the
sound
of
a
name
the
sound
of
the
name
of
the
hathor
the
hathor
see
the
hathor
comes
the
wanderer
turned
his
head
and
looked
swiftly
a
golden
chariot
sped
down
the
slope
of
sand
towards
the
gate
of
the
camp
the
horses
were
stained
with
sweat
and
splashed
with
blood
they
thundered
on
towards
the
gate
down
the
way
that
was
red
with
blood
as
the
horses
of
the
dawn
rush
through
the
sky
a
little
man
withered
and
old
drove
the
chariot
leaning
forward
as
he
drove
and
by
his
side
stood
the
golden
helen
the
red
star
blazed
upon
her
breast
her
hair
and
filmy
robes
floated
on
the
wind
she
looked
up
and
forth
now
she
saw
him
odysseus
of
ithaca
her
love
alone
beset
with
foes
and
a
cry
broke
from
her
she
tore
away
the
veil
that
hid
her
face
and
her
beauty
flashed
out
upon
the
sight
of
men
as
the
moon
flashes
from
the
evening
mists
she
pointed
to
the
gate
she
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
the
host
of
pharaoh
bidding
them
look
upon
her
and
follow
her
then
a
shout
went
up
from
the
host
and
they
rushed
onwards
in
the
path
of
the
chariot
for
where
the
helen
leads
there
men
must
follow
through
life
to
death
through
war
to
peace
on
the
chariot
rushed
to
the
camp
and
after
it
the
host
of
pharaoh
followed
the
holders
of
the
gate
saw
the
beauty
of
her
who
rode
in
the
chariot
they
cried
aloud
in
many
tongues
that
the
goddess
of
love
had
come
to
save
the
god
of
war
they
fled
this
way
and
that
or
stood
drunken
with
the
sight
of
beauty
and
were
dashed
down
by
the
horses
and
crushed
of
the
chariot
wheels
now
she
had
passed
the
gates
and
after
her
poured
the
host
of
pharaoh
now
rei
reined
up
the
horses
by
the
broken
chariot
of
the
wanderer
and
now
the
wanderer
with
a
shout
of
joy
had
sprung
into
the
chariot
of
helen
and
art
thou
come
to
be
with
me
in
my
last
battle
he
whispered
in
her
ear
art
thou
indeed
that
argive
helen
whom
i
love
or
am
i
drunk
with
the
blood
of
men
and
blind
with
the
sheen
of
spears
and
is
this
the
vision
of
a
man
doomed
to
die
it
is
no
vision
odysseus
for
i
am
helen
s
self
she
answered
gently
i
have
learned
all
the
truth
and
knowing
thy
fault
count
it
but
a
little
thing
yet
because
thou
didst
forget
the
words
of
the
immortal
goddess
who
being
my
foe
now
and
for
ever
set
this
cunning
snare
for
thee
the
doom
is
on
thee
that
helen
shall
not
be
thine
in
this
space
of
life
for
thou
fightest
in
thy
last
battle
odysseus
on
see
thy
hosts
clamour
to
be
led
and
there
the
foe
hangs
black
as
storm
and
shoots
out
the
lightning
of
his
spears
on
odysseus
on
that
the
doom
may
be
accomplished
and
the
word
of
the
ghost
fulfilled
then
the
wanderer
turned
and
called
to
the
captains
and
the
captains
called
to
the
soldiers
and
set
them
in
array
and
following
the
star
they
rolled
down
upon
the
gathered
foe
as
the
tide
rolls
upon
the
rocks
when
the
breath
of
the
gale
is
strong
and
as
the
waters
leap
and
gather
till
the
rocks
are
lost
in
the
surge
so
the
host
of
pharaoh
leapt
upon
the
foe
and
swallowed
them
up
and
ever
in
the
forefront
of
the
war
blazed
the
red
star
on
helen
s
breast
and
ever
the
sound
of
her
singing
pierced
the
din
of
death
now
the
host
of
the
barbarians
was
utterly
destroyed
and
the
host
of
pharaoh
came
up
against
the
wall
that
was
set
about
the
camp
of
the
achæans
to
guard
their
ships
and
at
its
head
came
the
golden
chariot
wherein
were
the
wanderer
and
helen
the
captains
of
the
achæans
looked
wondering
from
their
wall
watching
the
slaughter
of
their
allies
now
who
is
this
cried
a
captain
who
is
this
clad
in
golden
armour
fashioned
like
our
own
who
leads
the
host
of
pharaoh
to
victory
then
a
certain
aged
leader
of
men
looked
forth
and
answered
such
armour
i
have
known
indeed
and
such
a
man
once
wore
it
the
armour
is
fashioned
like
the
armour
of
paris
priam
s
son
paris
of
ilios
but
paris
hath
long
been
and
who
is
she
cried
the
captain
she
on
whose
breast
a
red
star
burns
who
rides
in
the
chariot
of
him
with
the
golden
armour
whose
shape
is
the
shape
of
beauty
and
who
sings
aloud
while
men
go
down
to
death
then
the
aged
leader
of
men
looked
forth
again
and
answered
such
a
one
have
i
known
indeed
so
she
was
wont
to
sing
and
hers
was
such
a
shape
of
beauty
and
such
a
star
shone
ever
on
her
breast
helen
of
ilios
argive
helen
it
was
who
wore
it
helen
because
of
whose
loveliness
the
world
grew
dark
with
death
but
long
is
helen
now
the
wanderer
glanced
from
his
chariot
and
saw
the
crests
of
the
achæans
and
the
devices
on
the
shields
of
men
with
whose
fathers
he
had
fought
beneath
the
walls
of
ilios
he
saw
and
his
heart
was
stirred
within
him
so
that
he
wept
there
in
the
chariot
alas
for
the
fate
that
is
on
me
he
cried
that
i
must
make
my
last
battle
in
the
service
of
a
stranger
against
my
own
people
and
the
children
of
my
own
dear
weep
not
odysseus
said
helen
for
fate
drives
thee
on
fate
that
is
cruel
and
changeless
and
heeds
not
the
loves
or
hates
of
men
weep
not
odysseys
but
go
on
up
against
the
achæans
for
from
among
them
thy
death
so
the
wanderer
went
on
sick
at
heart
shooting
no
shafts
and
striking
no
blow
and
after
him
came
the
remnant
of
the
host
of
pharaoh
then
he
halted
the
host
and
at
his
bidding
rei
drove
slowly
down
the
wall
seeking
a
place
to
storm
it
and
as
he
drove
they
shot
at
the
chariot
from
the
wall
with
spears
and
slings
and
arrows
but
not
yet
was
the
wanderer
doomed
he
took
no
hurt
nor
did
any
hurt
come
to
rei
nor
to
the
horses
that
drew
the
chariot
and
as
for
helen
the
shafts
of
death
knew
her
and
turned
aside
now
while
they
drove
thus
rei
told
the
wanderer
of
the
death
of
pharaoh
of
the
burning
of
the
temple
of
hathor
and
of
the
flight
of
helen
the
wanderer
hearkened
and
said
but
one
thing
for
in
all
this
he
saw
the
hand
of
fate
it
is
time
to
make
an
end
rei
for
soon
will
meriamun
be
seeking
us
and
methinks
that
i
have
left
a
trail
that
she
can
follow
and
he
nodded
at
the
dead
that
stretched
further
than
the
eye
could
reach
now
they
were
come
over
against
that
spot
in
the
wall
where
stood
the
aged
captain
of
the
achæans
who
had
likened
the
armour
of
the
wanderer
to
the
armour
of
paris
and
the
beauty
of
her
at
his
side
to
the
beauty
of
argive
helen
the
captain
loosed
his
bow
at
the
chariot
and
leaning
forward
watched
the
flight
of
the
shaft
it
rushed
straight
at
helen
s
breast
then
of
a
sudden
turned
aside
harming
her
not
and
as
he
marvelled
she
lifted
her
face
and
looked
towards
him
then
he
saw
and
knew
her
for
that
helen
whom
he
had
seen
while
he
served
with
cretan
idomeneus
in
the
argive
ships
when
the
leaguer
was
done
and
the
smoke
went
up
from
burning
ilios
again
he
looked
and
lo
on
the
wanderer
s
golden
shield
he
saw
the
white
bull
the
device
of
paris
son
of
priam
as
ofttimes
he
had
seen
it
glitter
on
the
walls
of
troy
then
great
fear
took
him
and
he
lifted
up
his
hands
and
cried
aloud
fly
ye
achæans
fly
back
to
your
curved
ships
and
away
from
this
accursed
land
for
yonder
in
the
chariot
stands
argive
helen
who
is
long
dead
and
with
her
paris
son
of
priam
come
to
wreak
the
woes
of
ilios
on
the
sons
of
those
who
wasted
her
fly
ere
the
curse
smite
then
a
great
cry
of
fear
rose
from
the
host
of
the
achæans
as
company
called
to
company
that
the
ghosts
of
paris
of
ilios
and
argive
helen
led
the
armies
of
pharaoh
on
to
victory
a
moment
they
gazed
as
frightened
sheep
gaze
upon
the
creeping
wolves
then
turning
from
the
wall
they
rushed
headlong
to
their
ships
behind
them
came
the
soldiers
of
pharaoh
storming
the
walls
and
tearing
at
their
flanks
as
wolves
tear
the
flying
sheep
then
the
achæans
turned
at
bay
and
a
mighty
fray
raged
round
the
ships
and
the
knees
of
many
were
loosened
and
of
the
ships
some
were
burned
and
some
were
left
upon
the
bank
but
a
remnant
of
them
were
pushed
off
into
the
deep
water
and
hung
there
on
their
oars
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
fray
now
the
sun
was
gone
down
so
that
men
could
scarce
see
to
slay
each
other
the
wanderer
stood
his
chariot
on
the
bank
watching
the
battle
for
he
was
weary
and
had
little
mind
to
swell
the
slaughter
of
the
people
of
his
own
land
now
the
last
ship
was
pushed
off
and
at
length
the
great
battle
was
done
but
among
those
on
the
ship
was
a
man
still
young
and
the
goodliest
and
mightiest
among
all
the
host
of
the
achæans
by
his
own
strength
and
valour
he
had
held
the
egyptians
back
while
his
comrades
ran
the
curved
ship
down
the
beach
and
the
wanderer
looking
on
him
deemed
him
their
hardiest
warrior
and
most
worthy
of
the
achæans
he
stood
upon
the
poop
of
the
ship
and
saw
the
light
from
the
burning
vessels
gleam
on
the
wanderer
s
golden
helm
then
of
a
sudden
he
drew
a
mighty
bow
and
loosed
an
arrow
charged
with
death
this
gift
to
the
ghost
of
paris
from
telegonus
son
of
circe
and
of
odysseus
who
was
paris
foe
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
as
he
cried
it
and
as
the
fateful
words
struck
on
the
ears
of
odysseus
and
the
ears
of
helen
the
shaft
pointed
by
the
gods
rushed
on
it
rushed
on
it
smote
the
wanderer
with
a
deadly
wound
where
the
golden
of
his
harness
joined
the
taslets
and
pierced
him
through
then
he
knew
that
his
fate
was
accomplished
and
that
death
came
upon
him
from
the
water
as
the
ghost
of
tiresias
in
hades
had
foretold
in
his
pain
for
the
last
time
of
all
he
let
fall
his
shield
and
the
black
bow
of
eurytus
with
one
hand
he
clasped
the
rail
of
the
chariot
and
the
other
he
threw
about
the
neck
of
the
golden
helen
who
bent
beneath
his
weight
like
a
lily
before
the
storm
then
he
also
cried
aloud
in
answer
oh
telegonus
son
of
circe
what
wickedness
hast
thou
wrought
before
the
awful
gods
that
this
curse
should
have
been
laid
upon
thee
to
slay
him
who
begat
thee
hearken
thou
son
of
circe
i
am
not
paris
i
am
odysseus
of
ithaca
who
begat
thee
and
thou
hast
brought
my
death
upon
me
from
the
water
as
the
ghost
when
telegonus
heard
these
words
and
knew
that
he
had
slain
his
father
the
famed
odysseus
whom
he
had
sought
the
whole
world
through
he
would
have
cast
himself
into
the
river
there
to
drown
but
those
with
him
held
him
by
strength
and
the
stream
took
the
curved
ship
and
floated
it
away
and
thus
for
the
first
and
last
time
did
the
gods
give
it
to
telegonus
to
look
upon
the
face
and
hear
the
voice
of
his
father
odysseus
but
when
the
achæans
knew
that
it
was
the
lost
odysseus
who
had
led
the
host
of
pharaoh
against
the
armies
of
the
nine
nations
they
wondered
no
more
at
the
skill
of
the
ambush
and
the
greatness
of
the
victory
of
pharaoh
now
the
chariots
of
meriamun
were
pursuing
and
they
splashed
through
the
blood
of
men
in
the
pass
and
rolled
over
the
bodies
of
men
in
the
plain
beyond
the
pass
they
came
to
the
camps
and
found
them
peopled
with
dead
and
lit
with
the
lamps
of
the
blazing
ships
of
the
aquaiusha
then
meriamun
cried
aloud
surely
pharaoh
grew
wise
before
he
died
for
there
is
but
one
man
on
the
earth
who
with
so
small
a
force
could
have
won
so
great
a
fray
he
hath
saved
the
crown
of
khem
and
by
osiris
he
shall
wear
now
the
chariots
of
meriamun
had
passed
the
camp
of
the
barbarians
and
were
come
to
the
inner
camp
of
the
achæans
and
the
soldiers
shouted
as
she
came
driving
furiously
the
wanderer
lay
dying
on
the
ground
there
by
the
and
the
light
of
the
burning
ships
flamed
on
his
golden
armour
and
on
the
star
at
helen
s
breast
why
do
the
soldiers
shout
he
asked
lifting
his
head
from
helen
s
breast
they
shout
because
meriamun
the
queen
is
come
rei
answered
let
her
come
said
the
wanderer
now
meriamun
sprang
from
her
chariot
and
walked
through
the
soldiers
who
made
way
bowing
before
her
royalty
to
where
the
wanderer
lay
and
stood
speechless
looking
on
him
but
the
wanderer
lifting
his
head
spake
faintly
hail
o
queen
he
said
i
have
accomplished
the
charge
that
pharaoh
laid
upon
me
the
host
of
the
barbarians
is
utterly
destroyed
the
fleet
of
the
aquaiusha
is
burned
or
fled
the
land
of
khem
is
free
from
foes
where
is
pharaoh
that
i
may
make
report
to
him
ere
i
die
pharaoh
is
dead
odysseus
she
answered
oh
live
on
live
on
and
thyself
thou
shalt
be
ay
meriamun
the
queen
answered
the
wanderer
i
know
all
the
pharaoh
is
dead
thou
didst
slay
pharaoh
thinking
thus
to
win
me
for
thy
lord
me
who
am
won
of
death
heavily
shall
the
blood
of
pharaoh
lie
upon
thee
in
that
land
whither
i
go
meriamun
and
whither
thou
must
follow
swiftly
thou
didst
slay
pharaoh
and
helen
who
through
thy
guile
is
lost
to
me
thou
wouldst
have
slain
also
but
thou
couldst
not
harm
her
immortality
and
now
i
die
and
this
is
the
end
of
all
these
loves
and
wars
and
wanderings
my
death
has
come
upon
me
from
the
meriamun
stood
speechless
for
her
heart
was
torn
in
two
so
that
in
her
grief
she
forgot
even
her
rage
against
helen
and
rei
the
priest
then
helen
spoke
thou
diest
indeed
odysseus
yet
it
is
but
for
a
little
time
for
thou
shalt
come
again
and
find
me
ay
odysseus
said
the
queen
and
i
also
will
come
again
and
thou
shalt
love
me
then
oh
now
the
future
opens
and
i
know
the
things
that
are
to
be
beneath
the
wings
of
truth
shall
we
meet
again
there
shall
we
meet
again
odysseus
and
there
thou
shalt
draw
the
veil
of
truth
said
the
helen
yea
quoth
the
dying
wanderer
there
or
otherwhere
shall
we
meet
again
and
there
and
otherwhere
love
and
hate
shall
lose
and
win
and
die
to
arise
again
but
not
yet
is
the
struggle
ended
that
began
in
other
worlds
than
this
and
shall
endure
till
evil
is
lost
in
good
and
darkness
swallowed
up
in
light
bethink
thee
meriamun
of
that
vision
of
thy
bridal
night
and
read
its
riddle
lo
i
will
answer
it
with
my
last
breath
as
the
gods
have
given
me
wisdom
when
we
three
are
once
more
twain
then
shall
our
sin
be
purged
and
peace
be
won
and
the
veil
be
drawn
from
the
face
of
truth
oh
helen
fare
thee
well
i
have
sinned
against
thee
i
have
sworn
by
the
snake
who
should
have
sworn
by
the
star
and
therefore
i
have
lost
thou
hast
but
lost
to
find
again
beyond
the
gateways
of
the
west
she
answered
low
then
she
bent
down
and
taking
him
in
her
arms
kissed
him
whispering
in
his
ear
and
the
blood
of
men
that
fell
ever
from
the
star
upon
her
breast
dropped
like
dew
upon
his
brow
and
vanished
as
it
dropped
and
as
she
whispered
of
joy
to
be
and
things
too
holy
to
be
written
the
face
of
the
wanderer
grew
bright
like
the
face
of
a
god
then
suddenly
his
head
fell
back
and
he
was
dead
dead
upon
the
heart
of
the
world
s
desire
for
thus
was
fulfilled
the
oath
of
idalian
aphrodite
and
thus
at
the
last
did
odysseus
lie
in
the
arms
of
the
golden
helen
now
meriamun
clasped
her
breast
and
her
lips
turned
white
with
pain
but
helen
rose
and
standing
at
the
wanderer
s
head
looked
on
meriamun
who
stood
at
his
feet
my
sister
said
helen
to
the
queen
see
now
the
end
of
all
he
whom
we
loved
is
lost
to
us
and
what
hast
thou
gained
nay
look
not
so
fiercely
on
me
i
may
not
be
harmed
of
thee
as
thou
hast
seen
and
thou
mayest
not
be
harmed
of
me
who
would
harm
none
though
ever
thou
wilt
hate
me
who
hate
thee
not
and
till
thou
learnest
to
love
me
sin
shall
be
thy
portion
and
bitterness
thy
but
meriamun
spoke
no
word
then
helen
beckoned
to
rei
and
spake
to
him
and
rei
went
weeping
to
do
her
bidding
presently
he
returned
again
and
with
him
were
soldiers
bearing
torches
the
soldiers
lifted
up
the
body
of
the
wanderer
and
bore
it
to
a
mighty
pyre
that
was
built
up
of
the
wealth
of
the
barbarians
of
chariots
spears
and
the
oars
of
ships
of
wondrous
fabrics
and
costly
furniture
and
they
laid
the
wanderer
on
the
pyre
and
on
his
breast
they
laid
the
black
bow
of
eurytus
then
helen
spoke
to
rei
once
more
and
rei
took
a
torch
and
fired
the
pyre
so
that
smoke
and
flame
burst
from
it
and
all
the
while
meriamun
stood
by
as
one
who
dreams
now
the
great
pyre
was
a
mass
of
flame
and
the
golden
armour
of
the
wanderer
shone
through
the
flame
and
the
black
bow
twisted
and
crumbled
in
the
heat
then
of
a
sudden
meriamun
gave
a
great
cry
and
tearing
the
snake
girdle
from
her
middle
hurled
it
on
the
flames
from
fire
thou
camest
thou
ancient
evil
she
said
in
a
dead
tongue
to
fire
get
thee
back
again
false
but
rei
the
priest
called
aloud
in
the
same
tongue
an
ill
deed
thou
hast
done
o
queen
for
thou
hast
taken
the
snake
to
thy
bosom
and
where
the
snake
passes
there
thou
must
even
as
he
spoke
the
face
of
meriamun
grew
fixed
and
she
was
drawn
slowly
towards
the
fire
as
though
by
invisible
hands
now
she
stood
on
its
very
brink
and
now
with
one
loud
wail
she
plunged
into
it
and
cast
herself
at
length
on
the
body
of
the
wanderer
and
as
she
lay
there
on
the
body
behold
the
snake
awoke
in
the
fire
it
awoke
it
grew
it
twined
itself
about
the
body
of
meriamun
and
the
body
of
the
wanderer
and
lifting
its
head
it
laughed
then
the
fire
fell
in
and
the
wanderer
and
meriamun
the
queen
and
the
snake
that
wrapped
them
round
vanished
in
the
heart
of
the
flames
for
awhile
the
golden
helen
stood
still
looking
on
the
dying
fire
then
she
let
her
veil
fall
and
turning
wandered
forth
into
the
desert
and
the
night
singing
as
she
passed
and
so
she
goes
wandering
wandering
till
odysseus
comes
again
now
this
is
the
tale
that
i
rei
the
priest
have
been
bidden
to
set
forth
before
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
in
my
splendid
tomb
that
i
have
made
ready
by
thebes
let
every
man
read
it
as
he
will
and
every
woman
as
the
gods
have
given
her
wit
palinode
thou
that
of
old
didst

pray
thee
of
thy
grace
be
good
to
us
though

ancient
minstrel

to
tell

with
sightless
eyes
grown

these

sorrows
and
who
heard
the
swell
of

round
the
world
ring
thunderous
and
thy
voice
break
when
knightly

fell
and
thou
who

years

borne
to
see
the
great

of
