road

every
minute

said
gosling
he
leaned
against
the
dresser
the
kitchen
was
hot
with
steam
and
he
fumbled
for
a
handkerchief
in
the
pocket
of
his
black
tail
coat
he
produced
first
a
large
red
bandanna
with
which
he
blew
his
nose
vigorously
snuff
brought
it
to
be
washed
he
remarked
and
then
brought
out
a
white
handkerchief
which
he
used
to
wipe
his
forehead
it
a
dirty
commented
mrs
gosling
well
you
ca
smoke
in
the
orfice
replied
gosling
must
be
doin
somethin
i
suppose
said
his
wife
when
the
recital
of
this
formula
had
been
accomplished
it
was
hallowed
by
a
precise
repetition
every
week
and
had
been
established
now
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
gosling
returned
to
the
subject
in
hand
they
does
a
lot
of
lookin
at
shops
he
said
and
then
nothin
satisfy
but
buyin
somethin
why
do
they
keep
away
from
oh
well
sales
begin
nex
week
replied
mrs
gosling
an
that
a
thing
we
to
consider
in
our
circumstances
she
left
the
vicinity
of
the
and
bustled
over
to
the
dresser
get
out
of
my
way
do
she
went
on
an
go
up
and
change
your
coat
be
ready
in
two
ticks
i
sha
wait
for
the
gells
if
they
ai
in
them
sales
is
a
fraud
remarked
gosling
but
he
did
not
stop
to
argue
the
point
he
went
upstairs
and
changed
his
respectable
morning
coat
for
a
short
alpaca
jacket
slipped
his
cuffs
over
his
hands
put
one
inside
the
other
and
placed
them
in
their
customary
position
on
the
chest
of
drawers
changed
his
boots
for
carpet
slippers
wetted
his
hair
brush
and
carefully
plastered
down
a
long
wisp
of
grey
hair
over
the
top
of
his
bald
head
and
then
went
into
the
bathroom
to
wash
his
hands
there
had
been
a
time
in
george
gosling
history
when
he
had
not
been
so
regardful
of
the
decencies
of
life
but
he
was
a
man
of
position
now
and
his
two
daughters
insisted
on
these
ceremonial
observances
gosling
was
one
of
the
world
successes
he
had
started
life
as
a
national
school
boy
and
had
worked
his
way
up
through
all
the
grades
messenger
junior
clerk
clerk
senior
clerk
head
clerk
accountant
to
his
present
responsible
position
as
head
of
the
with
a
salary
of
a
month
he
rented
a
house
in
wisteria
grove
brondesbury
at
a
year
he
was
a
sidesman
of
the
church
of
st
john
the
evangelist
kilburn
a
member
of
local
committees
and
in
moments
of
expansion
he
talked
of
seeking
election
to
the
district
council
a
solid
sober
thoroughly
respectable
man
gosling
about
whom
there
had
never
been
a
hint
of
scandal
grown
stout
now
and
bald
save
for
a
little
hair
over
the
ears
and
that
one
persistent
grey
tress
which
he
used
as
a
sort
of
insufficient
wrapping
for
his
naked
skull
such
was
the
george
gosling
seen
by
his
wife
daughters
neighbours
and
heads
of
the
firm
of
wholesale
provision
merchants
for
whom
he
had
worked
for
years
in
barbican
yet
there
was
another
man
hardly
realized
by
george
gosling
himself
and
apparently
so
little
representative
that
even
his
particular
cronies
in
the
office
would
never
have
entered
any
description
of
him
if
they
had
been
obliged
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
their
colleague
character
nevertheless
if
you
heard
gosling
laughing
uproariously
at
some
story
produced
by
one
of
those
cronies
you
might
be
quite
certain
that
it
was
a
story
he
would
not
repeat
before
his
daughters
though
he
might
tell
his
wife
if
it
were
not
too
broad
if
you
watched
gosling
in
the
street
you
would
see
that
he
took
a
strange
unaccountable
interest
in
the
feet
and
ankles
of
young
women
and
if
many
of
gosling
thoughts
and
desires
had
been
translated
into
action
the
vicar
of
st
john
the
evangelist
would
have
dismissed
his
sidesman
with
disgust
the
local
committees
would
have
had
no
more
of
him
and
his
wife
and
daughters
would
have
regarded
him
as
the
most
depraved
of
criminals
fortunately
gosling
had
never
been
tempted
beyond
the
powers
of
his
resistance
at
he
may
be
regarded
as
safe
from
temptation
he
seldom
put
any
restraint
upon
his
thoughts
outside
business
hours
but
he
had
an
ideal
which
ruled
his
life
the
ideal
of
respectability
george
gosling
counted
himself
and
others
counted
him
also
as
respectable
a
man
as
could
be
found
in
the
metropolitan
police
area
there
were
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
million
other
men
in
the
same
area
equally
respectable
as
he
was
drying
his
hands
gosling
heard
the
front
door
slam
and
his
daughters
voices
in
the
passage
below
followed
by
a
shrill
exhortation
from
the
kitchen
now
gels
up
dinner
all
ready
and
your
father
waitin
gosling
trotted
downstairs
and
received
the
usual
salute
from
his
two
girls
he
noted
that
they
were
a
shade
more
effusive
than
usual
want
more
money
for
was
his
inward
comment
they
were
always
wanting
money
for
he
adopted
his
usual
line
of
defence
through
dinner
and
constantly
brought
the
subject
of
conversation
back
to
the
need
for
a
reduction
of
expenses
he
did
not
see
blanche
wink
at
millie
across
the
table
during
these
strategic
exercises
nor
catch
the
glance
of
understanding
which
passed
between
the
girls
and
their
mother
so
as
his
dinner
comforted
and
cheered
him
gosling
began
to
relax
into
his
usual
facetiousness
incredibly
believing
despite
the
invariable
precedents
of
his
family
history
that
his
daughters
had
been
convinced
of
the
hopelessness
of
approaching
him
for
money
that
evening
the
credulous
creature
even
allowed
them
to
make
their
opening
and
then
assisted
them
to
a
statement
of
their
petition
they
were
talking
of
a
friend
engagement
to
be
married
and
gosling
with
an
obtuseness
he
never
displayed
in
business
remarked
wish
my
gels
get
married
talking
about
us
father
asked
blanche
well
you
the
only
gels
i
got
as
i
know
of
said
gosling
well
how
can
you
expect
us
to
get
married
when
we
have
got
a
decent
thing
to
put
on
returned
blanche
gosling
realized
his
danger
too
late
pooh
that
do
make
any
difference
he
said
hastily
adopting
a
thoroughly
unsound
line
of
defence
i
never
noticed
what
your
mother
was
wearing
when
i
courted
dessay
you
did
replied
millie
i
dessay
most
fellows
tell
you
what
a
girl
was
wearing
but
it
makes
just
all
the
difference
for
all
that
of
course
it
does
said
blanche
a
girl
got
no
chance
these
days
unless
she
can
look
smart
no
fellow
going
to
marry
a
dowdy
it
does
make
a
big
difference
there
no
denyin
put
in
mrs
gosling
as
though
she
was
being
convinced
against
her
will
and
now
the
sales
are
just
beginning
poor
gosling
knew
the
game
was
up
they
had
made
no
direct
attack
upon
his
pocket
yet
but
they
would
not
relax
their
grip
of
this
fascinating
subject
till
they
had
achieved
their
object
blanche
was
saying
that
she
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
anywhere
and
procrastination
would
be
met
at
once
by
the
argument
how
well
he
knew
it
based
on
the
premise
that
if
you
did
buy
at
you
had
to
pay
twice
as
much
later
it
was
quite
useless
for
gosling
to
fidget
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
frown
shake
his
head
and
look
horribly
determined
the
course
of
progress
was
unalterable
from
the
direct
attack
do
you
like
to
see
us
going
about
in
rags
father
through
the
stage
of
well
well
much
do
you
want
i
simply
ca
afford
and
the
ensuing
haggles
down
to
the
despairing
sigh
as
the
original
minimum
demanded
in
this
case
no
less
than
five
pounds
was
forlornly
conceded
and
clinched
by
blanche
we
must
have
it
before
the
end
of
the
week
dad
the
sales
begin
on
monday
at
the
end
of
it
all
he
received
what
compensation
they
had
to
offer
him
hugs
and
kisses
offers
to
do
all
sorts
of
impossible
things
assistance
in
getting
his
armchair
into
precisely
the
right
position
and
him
into
the
chair
and
the
table
cleared
and
the
lamp
in
just
the
right
place
for
him
to
read
his
evening
paper
which
was
fetched
for
him
from
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
and
finally
the
crux
of
gosling
whole
position
a
general
air
of
complacency
and
comfort
gosling
was
an
man
he
hated
rows
mind
you
you
two
he
remarked
with
a
return
to
facetiousness
as
he
settled
himself
with
his
carpet
slippers
spread
out
to
the
fire
mind
you
i
look
on
this
money
as
an
investment
you
two
gels
got
to
get
married
and
quick
or
i
shall
be
in
the
court
do
you
forget
as
these
is
bought
for
a
purpose
oh
do
be
so
horrid
father
said
blanche
with
a
change
of
front
it
sounds
as
if
we
were
setting
traps
for
men
well
ai
you
asked
gosling
you
said
just
now
not
like
that
interrupted
blanche
it
very
different
just
wanting
to
look
nice
personally
i
in
no
to
get
married
thank
you
you
wait
till
mr
right
comes
along
put
in
mrs
gosling
and
then
turned
the
conversation
by
saying
well
father
what
the
news
this
evening
nothin
excitin
replied
gosling
seems
this
new
plague
in
china
they
always
inventin
new
diseases
nowadays
or
callin
old
ones
by
new
names
said
mrs
gosling
the
two
girls
were
busy
with
a
sheet
of
and
a
stump
of
pencil
that
seemed
to
require
frequent
lubrication
they
were
making
calculations
this
one
quite
new
seemingly
returned
gosling
it
only
the
men
as
get
it
no
need
for
us
to
worry
then
put
in
millie
more
as
a
duty
some
slight
return
for
benefits
promised
than
because
she
took
any
interest
in
the
subject
blanche
was
absorbed
her
unseeing
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
mantelpiece
and
ever
and
again
she
removed
the
point
of
the
pencil
from
her
mouth
and
wrote
feverishly
oh
ai
there
replied
gosling
he
turned
his
head
in
order
to
argue
from
so
strong
a
position
and
where
you
be
and
all
the
rest
of
the
women
if
you
got
no
men
to
look
after
you
i
expect
we
could
get
along
pretty
well
if
we
had
to
said
millie
gosling
winked
at
his
wife
and
indicated
by
an
upward
movement
of
his
chin
that
he
was
astounded
at
such
innocence
who
buy
your
for
you
i
should
like
to
know
he
asked
we
have
to
earn
money
for
ourselves
said
millie
ah
i
like
to
see
you
or
blanche
takin
over
my
job
replied
her
father
why
i
lay
there
a
dozen
mistakes
in
the
she
doing
at
the
present
moment
let
me
see
blanche
descended
suddenly
from
visions
of
paradise
and
put
her
hand
over
the
sheet
of
you
ca
father
she
said
gosling
looked
sly
indeed
he
said
with
simulated
surprise
and
why
not
ai
i
to
be
allowed
to
judge
of
the
nature
of
the
investment
i
goin
in
for
i
might
give
you
an
or
two
from
the
point
of
view
blanche
shook
her
head
i
have
added
it
up
yet
she
said
gosling
did
not
press
the
point
he
returned
to
his
original
position
i
dunno
where
you
ladies
be
if
you
no
gentlemen
to
look
after
you
mrs
gosling
smirked
we
it
wo
come
to
that
she
said
china
a
long
way
off
appears
as
there
been
one
case
in
russia
though
remarked
gosling
he
saw
that
he
had
rather
a
good
thing
in
this
threat
of
male
extermination
a
pleasant
harmless
threat
to
hold
over
his
feminine
dependents
a
means
to
emphasize
the
facts
of
masculine
superiority
and
of
the
absolute
necessity
for
masculine
intelligence
facts
that
were
not
sufficiently
well
realized
in
wisteria
grove
at
times
mrs
gosling
yawned
surreptitiously
she
was
doing
her
best
to
be
pleasant
but
the
subject
bored
her
she
was
a
practical
woman
who
worked
hard
all
day
to
keep
her
house
clean
and
received
very
feeble
assistance
from
the
daughters
for
whom
her
one
ambition
was
an
establishment
conducted
on
lines
precisely
similar
to
her
own
millie
and
blanche
had
returned
to
their
calculations
and
were
completely
absorbed
in
russia
just
fancy
commented
mrs
gosling
in
moscow
said
gosling
studying
his
evening
news
was
an
official
on
the
railway
soon
as
the
disease
was
identified
as
a
case
of
the
new
plague
read
gosling
patient
was
at
once
removed
to
the
infectious
hospital
and
strictly
isolated
he
died
within
two
hours
of
his
admission
stringent
measures
are
being
taken
to
prevent
the
infection
from
spreading
was
a
married
man
asked
mrs
gosling
does
say
replied
her
husband
but
the
point
is
that
if
it
once
gets
to
europe
who
knows
where
it
stop
they
see
to
that
you
may
be
sure
said
mrs
gosling
with
a
beautiful
faith
in
the
scientific
resources
of
civilization
it
said
somethin
about
that
in
the
bit
you
just
read
gosling
was
not
to
be
done
out
of
his
argument
very
like
he
said
but
now
just
supposin
as
this
plague
did
spread
to
london
and
the
men
could
go
to
work
where
fancy
you
be
mrs
gosling
was
unable
to
grasp
the
intricacies
of
this
abstraction
well
of
course
every
one
knows
as
we
could
get
on
without
the
men
she
said
ah
well
there
you
are
got
it
in
once
said
gosling
and
you
gels
forget
it
he
added
turning
to
his
daughters
millie
only
giggled
but
blanche
said
all
right
dad
we
wo
the
girls
returned
to
their
calculations
they
had
arrived
at
the
stage
of
cutting
out
all
those
items
which
were
not
absolutely
necessary
five
pounds
had
proved
a
miserably
inadequate
sum
on
paper
gosling
returned
to
his
evening
news
which
presently
slipped
gently
from
his
hand
to
the
floor
mrs
gosling
looked
up
from
her
sewing
and
put
a
finger
on
her
lips
the
voices
of
blanche
and
millie
were
subdued
to
sibilant
whisperings
gosling
had
forgotten
his
economic
problems
and
his
daring
abstractions
concerning
a
world
despoiled
of
male
activity
especially
of
that
essential
activity
as
he
figured
it
the
making
of
money
the
was
enjoying
his
nap
hedged
about
protected
and
cared
for
by
his
womankind
there
may
have
been
a
quarter
of
a
million
in
greater
london
at
that
moment
who
however
much
they
differed
from
gosling
on
such
minor
questions
as
tariff
reform
or
the
capabilities
of
the
then
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
would
have
agreed
with
him
as
a
matter
of
course
on
the
essentials
he
had
discussed
that
evening
at
nine
the
click
of
the
followed
by
a
resounding
announced
the
arrival
of
the
last
post
millie
jumped
up
at
once
and
went
out
eagerly
mr
gosling
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
with
drunken
fixity
at
the
mantelpiece
then
without
moving
the
rest
of
his
body
he
began
to
grope
automatically
with
his
left
hand
for
the
fallen
newspaper
he
found
it
at
last
picked
it
up
and
pretended
to
read
with
eyes
it
the
post
dear
remarked
mrs
gosling
gosling
yawned
enormously
who
it
for
he
asked
millie
millie
called
mrs
gosling
why
do
you
bring
the
letters
in
millie
did
not
reply
but
she
came
slowly
into
the
room
in
her
hands
a
letter
which
she
was
examining
minutely
who
it
for
mill
asked
blanche
impatiently
father
replied
millie
still
intent
on
her
study
it
a
foreign
letter
i
seem
to
remember
the
writing
too
only
i
ca
fix
it
exactly
it
over
my
gel
said
gosling
and
millie
reluctantly
parted
with
her
fascinating
enigma
i
know
that
too
remarked
gosling
and
he
also
would
have
spent
some
time
in
the
attempt
to
guess
the
puzzle
without
looking
up
the
answer
within
the
envelope
but
the
three
spectators
who
were
not
sharing
his
interest
manifested
impatience
well
ai
you
going
to
open
it
father
asked
millie
and
mrs
gosling
looked
at
her
husband
over
her
spectacles
and
remarked
it
must
be
a
business
letter
if
it
comes
from
foreign
parts
do
get
business
letters
to
this
address
returned
the
head
of
the
house
besides
which
it
from
warsaw
we
do
do
with
warsaw
at
last
he
opened
the
letter
the
three
women
fixed
their
gaze
on
gosling
face
well
ejaculated
millie
after
a
silence
of
several
seconds
you
going
to
tell
us
you
never
guess
said
gosling
triumphantly
anyone
we
know
asked
blanche
yes
a
gentleman
oh

us
father
urged
the
impatient
millie
it
from
the
mr
thrale
as
lodged
with
us
once
announced
gosling
oh
dear
our
mr
fastidious

ago

must
be
over
four
years
since

put
in
mrs
gosling
getting
on
for
five
corrected
blanche
i
remember
i
put
my
hair
up
while
he
was
here
what
he
say
asked
millie
says
mr
gosling
i
expect
you
will
be
surprised
to
from
me
after
my
five
years
silence
i
said
it
was
five
years
put
in
blanche
go
on
dad
dad
resumed
i
been
in
various
parts
of
the
world
and
it
been
quite
impossible
to
keep
up
a
correspondence
i
am
writing
now
to
tell
you
that
i
shall
be
back
in
london
in
a
few
days
and
to
ask
you
whether
you
can
find
a
room
for
me
in
wisteria
grove
well
i
should
thought
he
written
to
me
to
ask
that
said
mrs
gosling
so
should
by
rights
agreed
gosling
but
a
queer
card
is
mr
thrale
bit
dotty
if
you
ask
me
said
blanche
that
all
asked
mrs
gosling
no
says
ca
give
you
an
address
as
i
go
on
to
berlin
immediately
but
i
will
look
you
up
the
evening
after
i
arrive
eastern
europe
is
not
safe
at
the
present
time
there
been
several
cases
of
the
new
plague
in
moscow
but
the
authorities
are
doing
everything
they
can
which
is
much
in
russia
to
keep
the
news
out
of
the
press
yours
sincerely
jasper
thrale
and
that
the
lot
concluded
gosling
i
do
think
he
a
cool
hand
commented
blanche
of
course
you
wo
have
him
as
a
paying
guest
now
gosling
and
his
wife
looked
at
each
other
thoughtfully
well
hesitated
gosling
might
bring
the
infection
suggested
mrs
gosling
oh
no
fear
of
that
returned
her
husband
but
i
dunno
as
we
want
a
boarder
now
five
years
ago
i
got
my
big
rise
oh
no
father
what
would
the
neighbours
think
of
us
if
we
started
to
take
boarders
again
protested
blanche
it
would
look
well
agreed
mrs
gosling
jus
what
i
was
thinking
said
the
head
of
the
house
there
no
in
payin
us
a
friendly
visit
o
course
not
said
mrs
gosling
though
i
do
think
it
odd
should
written
to
me
in
the
first
place
he
dotty
said
blanche
gosling
shook
his
head
not
by
a
very
long
chalk
ai
was
his
firm
pronouncement
well
girls
what
about
bed
asked
mrs
gosling
putting
away
the
bit
of
mending
she
had
been
engaged
upon
gosling
yawned
again
stretched
himself
and
rose
grunting
to
his
feet
i
about
ready
for
my
bed
he
remarked
and
after
another
yawn
he
started
his
nightly
round
of
inspection
when
he
returned
to
the
the
others
were
all
ready
to
retire
gosling
kissed
his
daughters
and
the
two
girls
and
their
mother
went
upstairs
gosling
carefully
took
off
the
larger
pieces
of
coal
from
the
fire
and
put
them
under
the
grate
rolled
up
the
hearthrug
saw
that
the
window
was
securely
fastened
extinguished
the
lamp
and
followed
his
womenfolk
as
he
was
undressing
his
thoughts
turned
once
more
to
the
threat
of
the
new
disease
which
was
devastating
china
rum
thing
about
that
new
plague
he
remarked
to
his
wife
seems
as
it
only
men
as
get
it
they
never
let
it
spread
to
england
replied
mrs
gosling
oh
there
no
fear
of
that
none
whatever
said
gosling
but
rum
that
about
women
never
catching
it
the
attitude
of
the
goslings
faithfully
reflected
that
of
the
immense
majority
of
english
people
the
faith
in
the
hygienic
and
scientific
resources
which
were
at
the
disposal
of
the
authorities
and
the
implicit
trust
in
the
vigilance
and
energy
of
those
authorities
were
sufficient
to
allay
any
fears
that
were
not
too
imminent
it
was
some
one
duty
to
look
after
these
things
and
if
they
were
not
looked
after
there
would
be
letters
in
the
papers
about
it
at
last
without
question
the
authorities
would
be
roused
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
the
trouble
whatever
it
was
would
be
stopped
precisely
what
authority
managed
these
affairs
none
of
the
huge
gosling
family
knew
vaguely
they
pictured
medical
boards
or
health
committees
dimly
they
connected
these
things
with
local
government
at
the
top
doubtless
was
some
managing
authority
in
whitehall
probably
something
to
do
with
the
supreme
head
of
affairs
the
much
abused
but
eminently
paternal
government
ii
the
opinions
of
jasper
thrale
lord
how
i
do
envy
you
said
morgan
gurney
jasper
thrale
sat
forward
in
his
chair
there
no
reason
why
you
should
do
what
i
done
and
more
he
said
theoretically
i
suppose
not
replied
gurney
it
just
making
the
big
effort
to
start
with
you
see
i
got
a
very
decent
berth
and
good
prospects
and
it
comfortable
and
all
that
only
when
some
fellow
like
you
comes
along
and
tells
one
yarns
of
the
world
outside
i
get
sort
of
hankerings
after
the
sea
and
adventure
and
seeing
the
big
things
it
only
now
and
then
ordinary
times
contented
enough
he
stuck
his
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
stared
into
the
fire
the
only
things
that
really
count
are
feeling
clean
and
strong
and
able
said
thrale
you
never
really
have
that
feeling
if
you
live
in
the
big
cities
i
felt
like
that
sometimes
after
a
long
bicycle
ride
interpolated
gurney
but
then
the
feeling
is
wasted
you
see
said
thrale
when
you
feel
like
that
and
there
is
something
tremendous
to
spend
it
upon
you
get
the
great
emotion
as
well
like
the
glimmer
of
st
agnes
light
after
you
been
eight
weeks
out
of
sight
of
land
reflected
gurney
going
back
to
one
of
reminiscences
to
feel
that
you
are
a
part
of
life
not
this
dead
stale
life
of
the
city
but
the
life
of
the
whole
universe
said
thrale
i
know
replied
gurney
i
half
a
mind
to
chuck
my
job
and
go
out
looking
for
mystery
but
you
wo
do
it
said
thrale
gurney
sighed
and
began
to
analyse
the
instinct
within
himself
to
find
precisely
why
he
wanted
to
do
it
well
i
must
go
said
thrale
getting
to
his
feet
i
got
to
find
some
sort
of
lodging
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
with
those
gosling
people
of
yours
said
gurney
no
that
off
i
went
to
see
them
last
night
and
they
wo
have
me
the
old
man
making
his
a
year
now
and
the
family
too
respectable
to
take
boarders
thrale
picked
up
his
hat
and
held
out
his
hand
but
look
here
old
chap
why
the
devil
ca
you
stay
here
asked
gurney
i
did
know
that
you
anywhere
to
put
me
said
thrale
oh
yes
there
always
a
room
to
be
had
downstairs
said
gurney
after
a
brief
discussion
the
arrangement
was
made
it
understood
i
to
pay
my
whack
said
thrale
of
course
if
you
insist
when
thrale
had
gone
to
fetch
his
luggage
from
the
hotel
gurney
sat
pondering
over
the
fire
he
was
debating
whether
he
had
been
altogether
wise
in
pressing
his
invitation
he
was
wondering
whether
the
curiously
rousing
personality
of
thrale
and
the
stories
of
those
still
existent
corners
of
the
world
outside
the
rules
of
civilization
were
good
for
a
civil
servant
with
an
income
of
a
year
gurney
faced
with
the
plain
alternatives
could
only
decide
that
he
would
be
a
fool
to
throw
up
a
congenial
and
lucrative
occupation
such
as
his
own
in
order
to
face
present
physical
discomfort
and
future
penury
he
knew
that
the
discomforts
would
be
very
real
to
him
at
first
his
friends
would
think
him
mad
and
all
for
the
sake
of
experiencing
some
high
emotion
now
and
again
in
order
to
feel
clean
and
fresh
and
be
able
to
discover
something
of
the
unknown
mystery
of
life
i
suppose
there
is
something
of
the
poet
in
me
reflected
gurney
and
i
expect
i
should
hate
the
discomforts
one
imagination
gets
led
away
during
the
next
few
evenings
the
conversations
between
these
two
friends
were
many
and
protracted
thrale
was
the
teacher
and
gurney
was
content
to
sit
at
his
feet
and
learn
he
had
a
receptive
mind
he
was
interested
in
all
life
but
uppingham
trinity
hall
and
the
home
civil
had
constricted
his
mental
processes
at
he
was
losing
flexibility
thrale
gave
him
back
his
power
to
think
set
him
outside
the
formulas
of
his
school
taught
him
that
however
sound
his
deductions
there
was
not
one
of
his
premises
which
could
not
be
disputed
thrale
was
gurney
senior
by
three
years
and
when
thrale
left
uppingham
at
eighteen
he
had
gone
out
into
the
world
he
had
a
patrimony
of
some
a
year
but
he
had
taken
only
a
lump
sum
of
and
had
started
out
to
appease
his
furious
curiosity
concerning
life
he
had
laboured
as
a
miner
in
the
klondike
had
sailed
working
his
passage
as
an
ordinary
seaman
from
san
francisco
to
southampton
he
had
been
a
stockman
in
australia
assistant
to
a
planter
in
ceylon
a
furnace
minder
in
kimberley
and
a
tally
clerk
in
hong
kong
for
nearly
nine
years
indeed
he
had
earned
a
living
in
every
country
of
the
world
except
europe
and
then
he
had
come
back
to
london
and
invested
the
accumulation
of
income
that
his
trustee
had
amassed
for
him
the
mere
spending
of
money
had
no
fascination
for
him
during
the
six
months
he
had
remained
in
london
he
had
lived
very
simply
lodging
with
the
goslings
in
kilburn
and
because
he
could
not
live
idly
exploring
every
corner
of
the
great
city
and
writing
articles
for
the
journals
he
might
have
earned
a
large
income
by
this
latter
means
for
he
had
an
originality
of
outlook
and
a
freshness
of
style
that
made
his
contributions
eagerly
sought
after
once
he
had
obtained
a
hearing
no
difficult
matter
in
london
for
anyone
who
has
something
new
to
say
but
experience
not
income
was
his
desire
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
he
had
accepted
an
offer
from
the
daily
post
as
a
european
correspondent
on
space
he
was
offered
a
year
but
he
preferred
to
be
free
and
he
had
no
wish
to
be
confined
to
one
capital
or
country
in
those
five
years
he
had
traversed
europe
sending
in
his
articles
irregularly
as
he
required
money
and
during
that
time
his
chief
trustee
a
lawyer
of
the
soundest
reputation
had
absconded
and
thrale
found
his
private
income
reduced
to
about
a
year
the
interest
on
one
of
the
investments
he
had
made
in
his
own
name
only
with
his
former
accumulation
two
other
investments
made
at
the
same
time
had
proved
unsound
this
loss
had
not
troubled
him
in
any
way
when
he
had
read
in
a
london
journal
of
his
trustee
abscondence
he
was
later
sentenced
to
fourteen
years
penal
servitude
thrale
had
smiled
and
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
he
could
always
earn
all
the
money
he
required
and
had
never
not
even
subconsciously
relied
upon
his
private
fortune
he
had
now
come
back
to
london
with
a
definite
purpose
he
had
come
to
warn
england
of
a
great
danger
one
other
distinguishing
mark
of
jasper
thrale
life
must
be
understood
a
mark
which
differentiated
him
from
the
overwhelming
majority
of
his
fellow
men
women
had
no
fascination
for
him
once
in
his
life
and
once
only
had
he
approached
and
tasted
experience
with
a
pretty
little
melbourne
cocotte
that
experience
he
had
undertaken
deliberately
because
he
felt
that
until
it
had
been
undergone
one
great
factor
of
life
would
be
unknown
to
him
he
had
come
away
from
it
filled
with
a
disgust
of
himself
that
had
endured
for
months
fragments
of
the
long
conversations
between
thrale
and
gurney
the
exchange
of
a
few
germane
ideas
among
the
irrelevant
mass
had
a
bearing
upon
their
immediate
future
there
was
for
instance
a
criticism
of
the
goslings
introduced
on
one
occasion
which
had
a
certain
significance
in
relation
to
subsequent
developments
some
question
of
gurney
prompted
thrale
to
the
opinion
that
the
goslings
were
in
the
main
precisely
like
half
a
million
other
families
of
the
same
class
but
that
just
what
makes
them
so
interesting
said
gurney
not
because
he
believed
it
but
because
at
the
moment
he
wanted
to
lead
the
conversation
into
safe
ground
away
from
the
too
appealing
attractions
of
the
big
world
outside
the
little
village
of
london
thrale
laughed
that
truer
than
you
guess
he
said
every
large
generalization
however
trite
is
a
valuable
contribution
to
knowledge
if
it
more
or
less
accurate
generalize
then
mon
vieux
suggested
gurney
from
the
characters
and
doings
of
your
little
geese
i
seen
glimmerings
of
the
immortal
god
in
the
old
man
said
thrale
like
the
hint
of
sunlight
seen
through
a
filthy
pane
of
obscured
glass
he
a
old
beast
leading
called
a
respectable
life
but
if
he
could
indulge
his
ruling
desire
with
absolute
secrecy
no
woman
would
be
safe
with
him
in
his
world
he
ca
do
that
or
thinks
he
ca
which
comes
to
precisely
the
same
thing
he
is
too
much
afraid
of
being
caught
he
sees
danger
where
none
exists
he
looks
to
all
sorts
of
possibilities
and
take
a
chance
because
he
is
risking
his
all
which
is
included
in
the
one
word
respectability
jolly
good
thing
what
remarked
gurney
good
for
society
as
a
whole
apparently
replied
thrale
but
surely
not
good
for
the
man
i
told
you
that
i
have
seen
glimmerings
of
the
god
in
him
but
outside
the
routine
of
his
work
the
man
mind
is
clogged
he
not
much
over
fifty
and
he
has
no
outlet
now
for
his
desires
he
like
a
man
with
choked
pores
and
his
body
is
poisoned
and
in
this
particular
gosling
is
certainly
no
exception
either
to
his
class
or
to
the
great
mass
of
civilized
man
well
what
i
wonder
is
whether
in
a
society
which
is
built
up
of
interdependent
units
the
whole
can
be
sound
when
the
greater
number
of
the
constituent
units
are
rotten
but
look
here
old
chap
protested
gurney
if
things
are
as
you
say
and
men
rule
the
country
why
should
they
alter
public
opinion
and
so
open
the
way
to
do
as
they
jolly
well
please
because
the
majority
are
too
much
ashamed
of
their
desires
to
dare
the
attempt
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
because
they
wish
to
open
the
way
for
other
men
they
are
united
in
this
they
are
as
jealous
as
women
if
they
once
opened
the
way
to
free
love
their
own
belongings
would
be
safe
what
your
remedy
then
oh
a
few
thousand
more
years
of
moral
development
said
thrale
carelessly
an
evolution
towards
a
fuller
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
life
and
a
finer
altruism
you
do
look
far
ahead
remarked
gurney
do
you
think
anyone
can
look
even
a
year
ahead
asked
thrale
there
have
been
some
pretty
good
attempts
in
some
ways
swedenborg
for
instance
and
samuel
butler
yes
yes
that
all
right
in
some
ways
the
development
of
certain
sorts
of
knowledge
for
example
but
there
is
always
the
chance
of
the
unpredictable
element
coming
in
and
upsetting
the
whole
calculation
some
invention
may
do
it
an
unforeseen
clash
of
opinions
or
an
epidemic
for
a
time
they
drifted
further
away
from
their
original
topic
till
some
remark
reminded
gurney
that
he
had
meant
to
ask
a
question
and
had
forgotten
it
by
the
way
he
said
i
wanted
to
ask
you
what
you
meant
when
you
said
you
had
seen
a
god
in
old
gosling
just
a
touch
of
imagination
and
wonder
now
and
again
replied
thrale
something
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
himself
i
remember
standing
with
him
on
blackfriars
bridge
and
he
looked
down
at
the
river
and
said
it
was
clean
once
banks
and
sand
and
so
on
before
all
this
muck
came
then
he
looked
at
me
quickly
to
see
if
i
was
laughing
at
him
that
was
the
god
in
him
trying
to
create
purity
out
of
filth
even
though
it
was
only
a
casual
thought
it
was
smothered
again
at
once
his
training
reasserted
itself
better
for
trade
the
way
it
is
though
was
his
next
remark
but
how
can
you
alter
it
asked
gurney
my
dear
chap
you
ca
alter
these
things
by
any
plan
any
more
than
you
can
dam
the
gulf
stream
we
can
only
lay
a
brick
or
two
in
the
right
place
we
are
the
architects
the
best
of
us
are
only
bricklayers
and
the
best
of
the
best
can
only
lay
two
or
three
bricks
in
a
lifetime
our
job
is
to
do
that
if
we
can
we
can
only
guess
very
feebly
at
the
design
of
the
building
and
often
it
is
our
duty
partly
to
pull
down
the
work
that
our
forefathers
built
presently
gurney
asked
if
his
companion
had
ever
seen
a
god
in
mrs
gosling
thrale
shook
his
head
it
did
come
within
my
experience
he
said
do
condemn
her
on
that
account
but
she
like
all
the
women
i
have
ever
met
has
been
too
intent
upon
the
facts
of
life
ever
to
see
its
mystery
mrs
gosling
had
the
power
to
conceive
an
abstract
idea
she
had
to
make
some
application
of
it
to
her
own
particular
experience
before
she
could
understand
the
simplest
concept
morality
to
her
signified
people
who
behaved
as
she
and
her
family
did
wickedness
meant
vaguely
criminals
sarah
jones
who
was
an
unmarried
mother
and
anyone
who
did
believe
in
the
god
of
the
established
church
always
people
you
see
in
this
connexion
in
others
it
might
be
things
but
ideas
apart
from
people
or
things
she
could
grasp
her
two
daughters
thought
in
precisely
the
same
way
one
saturday
afternoon
thrale
came
into
gurney
chambers
and
burst
out
just
heaven
why
you
fools
stand
it
i
ca
imagine
what
up
now
asked
gurney
thrale
sat
down
and
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
the
pupils
of
his
dark
eyes
were
contracted
and
seemed
to
glow
as
if
they
were
illuminated
from
within
i
was
in
oxford
street
this
morning
watching
the
women
at
the
sales
he
said
all
the
biggest
shops
in
london
are
devoted
to
women
clothes
do
you
realize
that
and
it
not
only
that
the
biggest
there
are
more
of
them
than
any
other
six
trades
put
together
can
show
bar
the
drink
trade
of
course
the
north
side
of
oxford
street
from
tottenham
court
road
to
the
marble
arch
is
one
long
succession
of
huge
drapers
and
milliners
and
what
in
god
name
is
the
sense
or
reason
of
it
what
do
these
huge
shops
sell
dresses
i
suppose
ventured
gurney
and
stockings
underlinen
corsets
hats
and
so
on
and
frippery
said
thrale
fixing
his
brilliant
dark
eyes
on
gurney
and
frippery
machine
lace
ribbons
yokes
cheap
blouses
feathers
insertions
belts
fifty
thousand
different
kinds
of
bits
and
rags
to
be
tacked
on
here
and
there
worn
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
thrown
away
millions
of
little
frivolous
stupid
odds
and
ends
that
are
bought
by
women
and
girls
of
all
classes
below
the
to
make
a
pretence
gauds
and
tawdry
rubbish
not
one
whit
better
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
than
the
shells
and
feathers
of
any
melanesian
savage
in
fact
meaningless
as
the
melanesians
decorations
are
they
do
achieve
more
effect
and
what
it
all
for
i
ask
you
thrale
paused
and
gurney
offered
his
solution
the
sex
instinct
fundamentally
is
it
he
said
the
desire
often
subconscious
no
doubt
to
attract
well
if
that
is
so
said
thrale
what
terribly
unintelligent
fools
women
must
be
if
women
really
set
out
to
attract
men
they
must
realize
that
they
are
pandering
to
a
sex
instinct
do
you
think
any
man
is
attracted
by
a
litter
of
odds
and
ends
does
every
woman
sneer
when
they
see
some
frenchwoman
perhaps
who
dresses
to
display
her
figure
instead
of
hiding
it
do
they
bitterly
resent
the
fact
that
their
own
are
resistlessly
drawn
to
stare
at
and
inwardly
desire
such
a
woman
do
they
know
perfectly
well
that
such
a
woman
is
attractive
to
men
in
a
way
their
own
disguised
bodies
can
never
be
yes
old
chap
but
your
average
english
girl
got
the
physical
attractions
to
start
with
put
in
gurney
look
at
it
in
another
way
then
replied
thrale
does
every
woman
know
perfectly
well
have
you
heard
them
say
that
a
nurse
dress
is
very
becoming
a
plain
more
or
less
print
dress
with
linen
collars
and
cuffs
do
you
know
yourself
that
that
attire
is
more
attractive
to
you
than
any
befrilled
and
bedecorated
arrangement
of
lace
ribbons
and
gauds
why
are
so
many
men
irresistibly
attracted
by
parlourmaids
and
housemaids
yes
meditated
gurney
that
all
true
enough
well
are
women
all
fools
or
what
is
it
the
majority
of
women
are
sheep
said
thrale
they
follow
as
they
are
led
and
do
or
wo
see
that
they
are
being
led
and
the
leaders
are
chiefly
men
men
who
have
trumpery
to
sell
why
do
the
fashions
change
every
year
sometimes
more
often
than
that
in
matters
of
detail
because
the
trade
would
smash
if
they
did
new
fashions
must
be
forced
on
the
buyers
or
the
returns
would
drop
women
would
be
able
to
make
their
last
year
clothes
do
for
another
summer
that
must
be
stopped
at
any
cost
those
vast
establishments
must
maintain
an
enormous
turnover
if
they
are
to
pay
their
fabulous
rents
and
armies
of
assistants
there
are
two
means
of
keeping
up
the
sales
and
both
are
utilized
to
the
full
the
first
is
to
supply
cheap
miraculously
cheap
rubbish
which
can
not
be
made
to
last
for
more
than
a
season
the
second
is
to
alter
the
fashions
which
affect
the
more
durable
stuffs
so
that
last
year
dresses
can
not
be
used
again
this
scheme
reacts
upon
the
poorer
buyers
because
it
compels
them
to
do
something
to
imitate
the
prevailing
mode
if
they
ca
afford
to
have
entirely
new
frocks
that
is
where
all
these
bits
of
frilling
and
come
in
stuff
to
imitate
the
real
buyers
the
large
majority
of
whom
do
buy
in
oxford
street
by
the
way
mind
you
there
is
a
limit
to
the
docility
of
women
in
this
connexion
they
refused
for
instance
to
return
to
the
crinoline
and
they
refused
the
harem
skirt
one
of
the
very
few
sensible
devices
of
the
and
this
in
the
face
of
the
prolonged
strenuous
and
expensive
methods
of
the
fashion
ring
with
regard
to
the
crinoline
i
think
that
failure
was
due
to
on
the
part
of
the
they
had
come
to
believe
that
they
could
make
the
poor
fools
of
women
accept
anything
and
on
the
two
marked
occasions
on
which
they
attempted
to
introduce
the
crinoline
the
contrast
to
the
existing
mode
was
too
glaring
if
the
fraud
had
been
worked
more
gradually
by
way
of
full
skirts
and
flounces
some
modification
of
the
crinoline
to
the
necessities
of
and
tubes
might
have
been
foisted
upon
the
buyers
oh
my
lord
ejaculated
gurney
do
you
mean
to
say
that
women
just
accept
these
fashions
without
any
sense
or
reason
at
all
you
rather
a
blithering
ass
at
times
gurney
remarked
thrale
gurney
smiled
you
do
give
me
time
to
think
he
said
i
feel
like
an
accumulator
being
charged
i
have
had
time
yet
to
begin
working
on
my
own
account
you
so
mighty
so
mighty
dynamic
and
positive
old
chap
well
it
so
absurdly
obvious
that
there
must
be
a
reason
for
women
accepting
the
fashions
you
idiot
returned
thrale
and
the
first
and
biggest
reason
is
class
distinction
the
women
with
money
want
to
brag
of
it
by
differentiating
themselves
from
the
ruck
of
their
sisters
and
the
poor
women
try
to
imitate
them
to
the
best
of
their
ability
women
dress
for
other
women
there
is
sex
rivalry
as
well
as
class
rivalry
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
they
dare
not
put
sex
rivalry
first
and
dress
to
please
men
alone
because
they
are
afraid
of
the
opinions
of
other
women
sounds
all
right
said
gurney
and
sighed
and
we
damned
fools
of
men
stand
all
this
foolishness
and
pay
for
it
pay
by
jove
i
should
think
so
i
should
like
to
see
the
trade
returns
of
all
the
stuff
of
this
kind
that
is
sold
in
england
alone
in
one
year
they
would
make
the
naval
estimates
look
small
warrant
we
even
imitate
the
women
foolishness
in
some
degree
there
are
men
fashions
too
but
the
madness
is
not
so
marked
fortunately
the
body
of
men
ca
afford
to
make
fools
of
themselves
as
well
as
of
their
women
though
they
are
asses
enough
to
wear
linen
shirts
and
collars
which
are
uncomfortable
unsightly
and
expensive
to
gurney
regarded
his
lecturer
canvas
shirt
and
collar
and
then
stood
up
and
observed
his
own
immaculate
linen
in
the
glass
over
the
fireplace
i
must
say
i
like
stiff
collars
and
shirts
he
remarked
gives
one
a
kind
of
spruceness
thrale
laughed
it
only
another
sex
instinct
he
said
women
like
men
to
look
when
you
are
playing
games
with
other
men
or
camping
out
you
do
care
a
hang
for
your
oh
and
i
admit
the
class
distinction
rot
comes
in
too
you
afraid
of
public
opinion
afraid
of
being
thought
common
if
the
jeunesse
dorée
started
the
soft
shirt
in
real
earnest
you
would
soon
be
able
to
persuade
your
women
that
that
looked
smart
or
spruce
or
whatever
you
liked
to
call
it
look
here
you
know
said
gurney
you
an
anarchist
that
what
you
are
you
half
a
woman
gurney
said
thrale
you
think
in
names
all
people
are
who
think
in
ideas
instead
of
following
conventions
not
until
he
had
been
staying
with
gurney
for
more
than
a
week
did
thrale
speak
explicitly
of
his
purpose
in
london
but
one
cold
evening
at
the
end
of
january
as
the
two
men
were
sitting
by
a
roaring
fire
that
gurney
had
built
up
the
younger
man
unknowingly
opened
the
subject
by
saying
things
are
pretty
slack
at
the
present
moment
the
evening
chronicle
has
even
fallen
back
on
the
plague
for
the
sake
of
news
what
do
they
say
asked
thrale
he
was
lying
back
in
his
chair
nursing
one
knee
and
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
oh
the
usual
rot
said
gurney
that
the
thing
is
understood
has
never
been
by
any
medical
or
scientific
authority
that
it
is
apparently
confined
to
one
little
corner
of
asia
at
the
present
time
but
that
if
it
got
hold
in
europe
it
might
be
serious
and
then
a
lot
of
yap
about
the
unknown
forces
of
nature
special
article
by
a
chap
who
been
reading
too
much
wells
i
should
imagine
it
seems
so
incredible
to
us
in
england
that
anything
really
serious
could
happen
remarked
thrale
we
are
so
well
looked
after
and
cared
for
we
sit
down
and
wait
for
some
authority
to
move
with
a
perfect
confidence
that
when
it
does
move
everything
is
bound
to
be
all
right
with
such
an
organism
as
society
has
become
said
gurney
things
must
be
worked
like
that
a
certain
group
to
perform
one
function
other
groups
for
other
functions
and
so
on
commented
thrale
some
day
to
be
perfected
in
socialism
i
believe
socialism
must
come
in
some
form
said
gurney
yes
it
an
interesting
speculation
in
some
ways
said
thrale
but
the
higher
forces
are
about
to
put
a
new
spoke
in
the
human
wheel
and
the
machinery
has
to
be
stopped
for
a
time
what
have
you
got
hold
of
now
asked
gurney
the
thoughtful
man
went
on
thrale
still
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
would
have
asked
me
to
define
my
expression
higher
forces
well
old
man
i
knew
that
was
beyond
even
your
capacity
returned
gurney
so
i
thought
we
might
the
cackle
and
come
to
the
thrale
suddenly
released
his
knee
and
sat
upright
then
he
moved
his
chair
so
that
he
directly
confronted
his
companion
look
here
gurney
he
said
and
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
contracted
till
they
looked
like
black
crystal
glowing
with
dark
red
light
do
you
realize
how
some
outside
control
has
always
diverted
progress
how
when
nations
have
tended
to
crystallize
into
specialized
government
some
irruption
from
outside
has
always
broken
it
up
you
can
trace
the
principle
through
all
known
history
but
the
most
marked
cases
are
those
of
the
egyptians
and
the
incas
two
nations
which
had
developed
specialized
government
to
a
science
there
is
some
power
whether
we
can
credit
it
with
an
intelligence
in
any
way
comprehensible
to
us
from
the
feeble
basis
of
our
own
knowledge
i
doubt
but
there
is
some
outside
power
which
will
not
permit
mankind
to
crystallize
into
an
organism
from
our
human
point
of
view
from
the
point
of
view
of
individual
comfort
and
happiness
it
would
be
of
enormous
benefit
to
us
if
we
could
develop
a
system
of
specialization
and
swamp
the
individual
in
the
community
and
in
times
of
peace
and
prosperity
that
is
always
the
direction
in
which
civilization
tends
to
evolve
but
beyond
a
certain
point
as
the
individualists
have
not
failed
to
point
out
that
state
of
perfect
government
will
lead
to
stagnation
degeneration
death
now
in
the
little
span
of
time
that
we
know
as
the
history
of
mankind
there
has
been
no
as
soon
as
a
nation
tended
to
become
and
degenerate
some
other
younger
more
barbarous
people
flowed
over
them
and
wiped
them
out
in
the
case
of
peru
the
process
had
gone
very
far
owing
to
the
advantages
of
the
peculiar
segregation
but
then
you
see
the
development
in
the
east
the
new
world
i
ought
to
explain
that
i
find
the
oldest
civilization
of
the
present
epoch
in
america
reached
a
point
in
spain
and
england
which
sent
them
out
across
a
hemisphere
to
wreck
and
destroy
the
incas
well
we
have
now
reached
a
condition
when
the
nations
are
in
touch
with
one
another
and
progress
becomes
more
general
we
are
in
sight
of
a
system
of
european
colonial
and
socialism
more
or
less
reciprocal
and
carrying
the
promise
of
universal
peace
whence
you
ask
is
any
irruption
to
come
that
will
break
up
this
strong
crystallizing
system
which
is
admittedly
to
work
for
the
happiness
and
comfort
of
the
individual
there
has
been
much
talk
of
an
asiatic
invasion
a
rebellious
india
or
an
invading
china
but
those
civilizations
are
older
than
ours
if
we
can
trust
the
precedents
of
history
in
this
connexion
the
conquerors
have
always
been
the
younger
race
he
broke
off
abruptly
gurney
had
been
sitting
fascinated
and
hypnotized
by
the
compulsion
of
thrale
personality
he
had
been
held
by
the
keen
intent
stare
of
those
wonderful
dark
eyes
when
thrale
stopped
however
the
tension
snapped
well
remarked
gurney
i
think
that
a
jolly
good
argument
to
prove
that
we
have
at
last
reached
a
stage
of
universal
progress
towards
the
ideal
you
ca
conceive
asked
thrale
of
any
cataclysm
that
would
involve
a
return
to
the
old
segregation
of
nations
and
bring
about
a
new
epoch
beginning
with
separated
peoples
evolving
on
more
or
less
racial
lines
gurney
pondered
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
shook
his
head
little
wonder
said
thrale
i
had
often
considered
this
problem
and
i
could
think
of
no
upheaval
which
would
bring
about
the
familiar
effect
of
submersion
years
ago
there
was
always
the
possibility
of
a
european
war
but
even
that
would
have
only
a
temporary
effect
despite
the
forecast
of
mr
wells
in
the
war
in
the
air
no
i
considered
and
wondered
if
my
theory
was
faulty
i
was
willing
to
reject
it
if
i
could
find
a
flaw
and
then
questioned
gurney
thrale
leaned
forward
again
and
once
more
compelled
the
fascinated
attention
and
then
when
i
was
in
northern
china
seven
weeks
ago
i
saw
a
solution
so
appalling
so
inconceivably
ghastly
that
i
rejected
it
with
horror
for
days
i
went
about
fighting
my
own
conviction
i
could
believe
it
by
god
i
would
not
believe
it
there
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
the
border
of
tibet
the
outside
forces
have
planted
a
seed
which
has
been
maturing
in
secret
for
more
than
a
year
there
that
seed
has
taken
root
and
from
that
centre
is
spreading
more
and
more
rapidly
and
it
may
spread
over
the
whole
world
it
is
like
some
filthily
poisonous
and
incredibly
prolific
weed
and
its
seeds
now
that
it
has
once
established
itself
are
borne
by
every
wind
dropping
here
and
there
in
an
circle
every
seed
becoming
a
fresh
centre
of
distribution
outwards
but
what
in
heaven
name
is
the
weed
whispered
gurney
a
new
disease
a
new
plague
unknown
by
man
against
which
so
far
as
we
know
he
has
no
weapon
in
those
scattered
villages
among
the
mountains
there
are
no
men
left
to
work
everything
is
done
by
women
they
are
prohibited
more
fiercely
than
any
leper
settlement
no
one
dares
to
approach
within
five
miles
of
them
but
every
week
or
two
another
village
is
smitten
and
the
inhabitants
fly
in
terror
and
carry
the
infection
with
them
gurney
it
come
to
europe
there
are
new
centres
of
distribution
in
russia
at
the
present
time
if
it
is
stopped
it
will
come
to
england
and
it
does
decimate
the
population
it
wipes
the
men
clean
out
of
existence
not
one
man
in
ten
thousand
the
chinese
say
escapes
is
it
possible
that
this
can
be
the
means
of
the
i
spoke
of
the
means
to
segregate
the
nations
once
more
iii
london
incredulity
jasper
thrale
mission
was
no
easy
one
england
it
appeared
was
slightly
preoccupied
at
the
moment
and
had
no
ear
for
warnings
generally
he
was
either
treated
as
a
fanatic
and
laughed
at
or
he
was
told
that
he
greatly
exaggerated
the
danger
and
that
these
matters
could
safely
be
entrusted
to
the
local
government
board
which
had
brilliantly
handled
the
recent
outbreak
of
disease
but
there
were
some
exceptions
to
this
rule
his
first
definite
statement
had
been
made
to
his
own
editor
watson
maxwell
of
the
daily
post
yes
said
maxwell
when
he
had
given
thrale
a
patient
hearing
it
is
certainly
a
matter
that
needs
attention
would
you
care
to
go
out
as
our
special
commissioner
and
report
at
length
there
is
time
replied
thrale
the
thing
is
urgent
maxwell
brought
his
eyebrows
together
and
looked
keenly
at
his
correspondent
do
you
really
think
it
so
serious
thrale
he
asked
after
all
what
evidence
have
you
beyond
the
chinese
reports
i
know
there
are
several
cases
in
russia
said
thrale
yes
yes
i
do
doubt
that
returned
maxwell
with
a
touch
of
impatience
but
unless
you
can
bring
evidence
to
show
that
this
new
disease
is
as
deadly
as
you
say
it
is
not
a
matter
that
i
could
give
space
to
at
the
present
time
for
one
thing
the
evening
chronicle
has
been
making
rather
a
feature
of
it
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
and
i
do
see
that
i
could
do
much
unless
we
had
some
special
inside
information
then
the
house
will
be
sitting
again
next
week
and
it
seems
to
me
not
altogether
improbable
that
we
shall
have
a
stormy
session
which
will
mean
that
a
good
deal
of
ordinary
matter
will
have
to
give
way
he
broke
off
and
then
added
with
a
friendly
smile
but
if
you
would
go
out
as
our
commissioner
we
should
be
glad
to
make
you
a
proposal
there
will
be
no
need
for
a
commissioner
in
a
week
time
replied
thrale
you
do
seem
to
understand
that
i
not
looking
out
for
a
job
i
do
want
to
write
articles
i
do
want
to
be
paid
for
the
information
i
can
supply
i
foresee
a
grave
danger
which
is
growing
more
grave
hourly
by
reason
of
the
russian
government
censorship
of
all
reports
referring
to
the
plague
it
is
a
danger
which
should
be
understood
at
once
if
you
send
any
commissioner
send
the
cleverest
physician
you
can
find
and
a
bacteriologist
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
thrale
earnestness
and
maxwell
who
was
not
only
a
very
capable
editor
but
also
an
able
and
intellectual
man
was
impressed
unfortunately
the
interests
of
his
proprietors
at
that
moment
necessitated
a
great
effort
to
prop
up
the
very
unstable
liberal
government
which
had
been
in
power
for
four
years
and
was
now
on
its
last
legs
it
was
so
essential
from
the
proprietors
point
of
view
three
of
them
were
on
the
government
front
bench
that
the
dissolution
should
be
postponed
until
such
time
as
the
ministry
could
go
to
the
country
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
a
tentative
english
church
disestablishment
bill
was
to
be
introduced
in
the
coming
session
and
it
was
hoped
that
if
the
government
had
to
go
to
the
country
they
could
make
a
platform
on
that
one
clear
issue
it
was
a
good
bill
designed
to
win
the
nonconformist
vote
without
completely
alienating
the
high
church
party
in
other
words
the
government
was
eager
at
that
moment
to
please
the
majority
of
the
electors
which
is
presumably
the
highest
object
of
a
representative
government
if
it
had
been
at
any
other
time
said
maxwell
and
pushed
his
chair
back
thrale
understood
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
hat
we
shall
be
glad
to
print
any
articles
you
care
to
send
us
said
maxwell
with
his
kind
smile
but
i
ca
undertake
a
campaign
you
understand
at
the
present
moment
it
was
nearly
four
but
thrale
just
managed
to
catch
groves
of
the
evening
chronicle
groves
had
his
hat
on
and
was
just
off
to
tea
at
his
club
when
thrale
name
was
sent
in
to
him
he
told
the
messenger
that
he
would
see
mr
thrale
in
the
downstairs
thrale
had
had
some
experience
of
newspaper
methods
and
he
inferred
that
the
reception
was
equivalent
to
a
refusal
to
see
him
he
knew
what
those
interviews
in
downstairs
implied
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
treated
like
an
insurance
agent
or
a
tradesman
and
told
in
effect
not
thank
you
in
this
case
he
was
mistaken
in
his
inference
groves
had
had
an
eye
on
thrale
articles
for
some
time
past
and
though
he
thought
it
a
diplomatic
essential
to
keep
his
man
waiting
for
ten
minutes
he
had
no
intention
of
offending
him
groves
came
into
the
with
a
slightly
abstracted
air
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
mr
thrale
he
said
the
fact
is
that
i
wanted
to
finish
before
i
left
did
you
want
to
see
me
about
anything
particular
yes
returned
thrale
i
have
some
facts
about
the
new
plague
which
ought
to
be
given
publicity
at
once
groves
pursed
his
thick
lips
and
shook
his
head
well
well
he
said
will
you
come
and
have
tea
with
me
at
the
club
he
took
thrale
assent
for
granted
and
went
out
abruptly
leaving
his
guest
to
follow
in
the
taxicab
groves
talked
of
nothing
but
the
lack
of
originality
in
invention
in
reference
to
aeroplanes
he
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
personal
affront
that
no
workable
adaptation
of
the
aeroplane
had
been
made
to
passenger
traffic
indeed
it
was
not
till
after
tea
in
groves
case
an
euphemism
for
whisky
and
soda
that
he
would
approach
the
subject
of
thrale
visit
the
fact
is
my
dear
fellow
he
said
that
our
campaign
caught
on
i
going
to
let
it
down
gently
and
drop
it
after
edition
you
see
we
got
to
get
the
government
out
this
session
and
i
going
to
start
a
new
campaign
ca
give
you
any
particulars
yet
but
you
see
the
beginning
of
it
next
monday
like
maxwell
groves
differentiated
between
the
uses
of
the
singular
and
plural
pronouns
in
speaking
of
his
work
there
was
a
distinction
to
be
inferred
between
the
initiation
and
responsibilities
of
the
editor
and
those
of
his
proprietors
groves
was
not
at
all
impressed
by
any
earnestness
or
forebodings
he
seemed
to
think
that
a
touch
of
the
plague
in
london
might
be
rather
a
good
thing
in
some
ways
people
wanted
waking
up
especially
to
the
importance
of
getting
rid
of
the
present
government
it
appeared
that
thrale
articles
on
other
subjects
would
be
acceptable
to
the
readers
of
the
evening
chronicle
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
he
should
go
out
to
russia
as
a
special
commissioner
grant
lacey
of
the
times
listened
seriously
to
thrale
exposition
and
then
in
a
finely
delivered
speech
which
lasted
twenty
minutes
proved
to
his
own
complete
satisfaction
that
thrale
premises
deductions
and
whole
argument
were
thoroughly
unsound
lacey
however
was
greatly
interested
in
the
condition
of
russia
and
promised
thrale
magnificent
terms
if
he
would
tour
st
petersburg
moscow
kiev
warsaw
and
then
return
and
contribute
a
special
series
of
articles
references
to
the
new
plague
would
not
be
prohibited
in
the
series
if
thrale
still
found
any
cause
for
alarm
in
all
thrale
had
interviews
with
the
editors
of
nine
important
journals
the
other
six
developed
on
the
general
lines
already
indicated
either
he
was
not
taken
seriously
or
was
told
that
the
danger
was
greatly
exaggerated
the
real
causes
of
his
failure
were
two
first
the
critical
position
of
the
government
second
the
precocious
campaign
of
the
evening
chronicle
the
latter
had
taken
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
less
enterprising
journals
thrale
next
step
was
to
obtain
introductions
to
ministers
and
prominent
members
of
the
opposition
but
from
them
he
received
even
less
attention
he
did
not
obtain
interviews
on
many
occasions
and
if
possible
less
encouragement
the
president
of
the
local
government
board
informed
him
that
the
matter
was
already
engaging
that
department
energies
the
others
were
all
manifestly
preoccupied
with
more
immediate
interests
but
little
less
than
a
fortnight
after
the
initiation
of
his
campaign
thrale
received
a
special
message
from
the
editor
of
the
daily
post
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
the
messenger
was
waiting
with
a
taxicab
the
message
ran
received
through
news
agency
report
of
three
cases
of
plague
in
berlin
can
you
come
down
at
once
maxwell
iv
mr
barker
flair
jasper
thrale
in
the
partial
exposition
of
his
philosophy
if
that
description
is
not
too
large
for
such
vague
imaginings
had
included
very
definite
reference
to
certain
higher
forces
to
which
he
had
attributed
peculiar
powers
of
interference
in
management
of
its
own
concerns
doubtless
these
powers
had
control
of
various
instruments
and
were
able
to
exercise
their
influence
in
any
direction
and
by
any
means
in
the
present
case
it
would
seem
that
they
were
working
in
devious
and
subtle
ways
and
in
this
at
least
they
differed
not
at
all
from
the
methods
attributable
to
that
we
have
called
providence
or
the
laws
of
nature
any
assumed
guide
or
irrefragible
incomprehensible
ordination
it
is
a
common
characteristic
of
these
forces
that
they
seem
able
to
control
the
inconceivably
great
and
the
inconceivably
small
with
equal
certitude
not
that
george
gosling
touched
any
limits
he
was
moderately
large
in
body
and
small
in
intellect
but
neither
the
physical
excess
nor
the
mental
deficiency
marked
him
out
from
his
fellow
men
in
the
office
indeed
he
was
regarded
by
the
firm
and
his
colleagues
as
a
capable
man
of
business
whose
embonpoint
was
quite
consistent
with
his
employment
by
a
firm
of
wholesale
provision
merchants
on
the
thursday
morning
that
saw
the
announcement
in
the
morning
papers
that
a
case
of
the
new
plague
was
reported
in
berlin
gosling
was
called
into
the
partners
private
office
on
some
matter
of
accountancy
the
senior
partner
of
barker
and
prince
was
eager
grasping
and
imaginative
his
name
had
originally
been
german
and
ended
in
stein
but
he
had
changed
it
for
the
convenience
of
his
english
connexion
prince
was
a
large
rubicund
man
friendly
and
noisy
in
his
manners
but
accounted
a
shrewd
buyer
it
was
not
until
gosling
was
about
to
depart
that
the
higher
forces
turned
their
attention
to
barbican
and
then
they
suddenly
urged
gosling
to
say
without
premeditation
on
his
part
i
see
there
a
case
of
this
new
plague
in
berlin
mr
prince
laughed
and
winked
at
his
subordinate
some
of
us
have
to
start
a
hareem
soon
who
knows
he
said
and
laughed
again
more
loudly
than
ever
i
suppose
you
haf
not
heard
any
other
reports
eh
asked
mr
barker
well
curiously
enough
i
said
gosling
a
young
feller
who
used
to
lodge
with
us
five
years
back
come
from
russia
about
a
fortnight
since
and
tells
me
as
the
plague
spreadin
like
wildfire
in
russia
mr
prince
laughed
again
and
mr
barker
seemed
about
to
turn
his
attention
to
other
matters
when
the
higher
forces
sent
gosling
the
one
great
inspiration
of
his
life
it
came
to
him
with
startling
suddenness
but
he
gave
utterance
to
it
as
simply
and
with
as
little
verve
as
he
spoke
his
good
morning
to
the
i
been
thinkin
sir
he
said
he
had
never
once
thought
of
it
until
this
moment
as
it
might
be
well
to
keep
a
neye
on
this
plague
so
to
speak
ah
zo
said
mr
barker
a
phrase
which
gosling
correctly
interpreted
as
the
expression
of
a
desire
for
the
elucidation
of
his
last
remark
well
i
been
thinkin
if
you
excuse
me
sir
he
went
on
as
though
the
plague
only
in
the
bud
so
to
speak
at
the
present
time
it
seems
very
likely
to
spread
so
far
as
we
can
judge
and
that
what
with
quarantine
and
shortage
of
labour
and
so
on
it
might
mean
prices
for
our
stuff
zo
said
mr
barker
but
this
time
the
monosyllable
was
reflective
the
great
inspiration
had
found
fruitful
soil
brince
continued
barker
after
a
minute
thought
i
haf
a
flair
we
will
buy
heavily
at
once
but
not
through
our
london
house
no
or
others
will
follow
us
too
quickly
you
must
not
go
we
will
zend
ztewart
from
dundee
it
will
zeem
that
we
prepare
for
the
zhipping
strike
in
the
north
we
buy
heavily
yes
i
haf
a
flair
but
i
say
said
mr
prince
who
had
the
greatest
confidence
in
his
partner
insight
i
say
barker
think
this
plague
serious
i
am
putting
money
on
it
ai
i
asked
barker
prince
and
gosling
exchanged
a
scared
glance
until
that
moment
it
had
not
come
home
to
either
of
them
that
it
was
possible
for
english
affairs
to
be
affected
by
this
strange
and
deadly
disease
the
remainder
of
the
conversation
was
complicated
and
exceedingly
technical
when
he
came
back
into
the
gosling
looked
unnaturally
thoughtful
anything
gorne
wrong
asked
his
crony
flack
there
nothing
wrong
with
the
if
that
what
you
mean
replied
gosling
mysteriously
what
then
asked
flack
it
this
new
plague
returned
gosling
tchah
that
all
my
eye
said
flack
he
was
a
man
of
sixty
with
a
thin
grey
beard
and
he
had
a
consistently
incredulous
mind
out
here
in
the
gosling
thrill
of
fear
was
rapidly
subsiding
and
he
had
no
intention
of
passing
over
his
own
important
part
in
the
house
decision
to
buy
for
a
rise
so
he
bulged
out
his
cheeks
shook
his
head
and
said
not
by
a
long
chalk
it
ai
flack
not
by
a
long
chalk
there
was
that
young
feller
thrale
as
i
was
tellin
you
about
gave
me
a
hidea
or
two
and
now
we
this
very
serious
news
from
berlin
papers
to
make
the
worst
of
everything
said
flack
their
livin
anyways
continued
gosling
i
put
it
quite
straight
to
the
this
mornin
as
we
might
do
worse
under
the
circumstances
than
buy
you
did
asked
flack
and
he
cocked
up
his
spectacles
and
looked
at
gosling
underneath
them
i
did
replied
gosling
what
did
mr
barker
say
to
that
asked
flack
he
took
my
advice
lord
sakes
you
do
tell
me
so
said
flack
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
i
now
about
to
dictate
various
letters
to
our
in
dundee
replied
gosling
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
assuming
an
air
of
mysterious
importance
advising
them
to
send
our
mr
stewart
to
vienna
immediate
from
where
is
to
proceed
to
berlin
is
also
to
private
instructions
from
the
as
to
the
extent
of
buyin
which
i
may
tell
you
in
confidence
flack
will
be
enormous
gosling
raised
his
head
slowly
on
the
first
syllable
brought
it
down
with
a
jerk
on
the
second
and
left
the
third
largely
to
the
imagination
but
mean
to
tell
me
expostulated
flack
as
all
this
is
on
account
of
this
plague
they
been
usin
that
as
a
blind
my
boy
gosling
laid
a
bunch
of
swollen
fingers
on
his
colleague
arm
i
tell
you
flack
old
boy
he
said
that
this
is
serious
when
mr
barker
took
up
my
advice
as
did
very
quick
mr
prince
said
do
tell
me
as
you
really
take
this
plague
serious
barker
said
and
mr
barker
looked
up
and
says
goin
to
put
all
my
money
on
it
gosling
paused
and
then
repeated
mr
barker
says
as
goin
to
put
all
our
money
on
it
flack
lord
sakes
said
flack
here
indeed
was
an
argument
strong
enough
to
break
down
even
his
consistent
incredulity
but
mean
to
tell
me
he
persisted
that
mr
barker
thinks
as
it
come
to
england
you
know
returned
gosling
we
need
not
go
quite
so
far
as
that
but
it
may
go
far
enough
to
interfere
with
european
markets
there
may
be
trouble
with
quarantine
and
ah
well
that
said
flack
with
an
air
of
relief
jus
so
so
mr
barker
can
see
as
far
through
a
brick
wall
as
most
people
and
so
i
always
said
he
dropped
his
spectacles
on
to
his
nose
again
and
returned
to
his
interrupted
accountancy
gosling
went
fussily
into
his
own
room
and
rang
for
his
typist
a
competent
and
presentable
young
woman
among
whose
duties
that
of
turning
her
superior
letters
into
equivalent
english
was
not
the
lightest
gosling
was
very
full
of
importance
that
day
and
during
lunch
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
secret
and
valuable
information
he
was
too
well
versed
in
city
methods
and
too
loyal
to
his
own
house
to
give
any
hint
of
barker
and
prince
speculations
in
austria
and
germany
but
when
the
subject
of
the
new
plague
inevitably
came
into
the
conversation
he
spoke
with
an
authority
that
was
heightened
by
the
hint
of
reserve
implicit
in
his
every
dictum
when
the
latest
joke
on
the
subject
fresh
from
the
stock
exchange
had
been
retailed
by
one
of
the
usual
group
of
lunchers
and
had
been
received
with
the
guffaws
it
merited
gosling
suddenly
screwed
his
face
to
an
unaccustomed
seriousness
and
said
but
it
serious
you
know
extremely
serious
and
by
degrees
from
this
and
many
other
better
informed
sources
the
rumour
ran
through
the
city
that
the
new
plague
was
serious
extremely
serious
that
afternoon
there
was
a
slight
drop
of
prices
in
certain
industrial
shares
and
a
slight
rise
in
wheat
and
some
other
imported
food
stuffs
fluctuations
which
could
not
be
attributed
to
ordinary
causes
mr
barker
foresight
was
justified
once
again
in
the
eyes
of
gosling
and
flack
before
five
another
letter
was
posted
to
dundee
enforcing
haste
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
that
evening
gosling
was
a
little
pompous
and
talked
of
economy
but
his
wife
and
daughters
although
they
assumed
an
air
of
interest
were
quite
convinced
that
the
head
of
the
house
in
wisteria
grove
was
making
the
most
of
a
rumour
for
his
own
purposes
as
blanche
said
to
millie
later
father
was
always
finding
some
excuse
for
keeping
them
short
of
dress
money
that
five
pounds
had
proved
inadequate
to
supply
even
their
immediate
necessities
and
they
were
already
meditating
another
attack
we
simply
must
get
another
three
pounds
somehow
said
millie
and
blanche
quite
agreed
with
her
v
the
closed
door
there
was
a
lull
for
hours
after
that
announcement
of
the
case
of
the
new
plague
in
berlin
and
maxwell
was
beginning
to
regret
his
headlines
when
the
news
began
to
come
in
this
time
in
volume
the
russian
censorship
had
broken
down
and
the
news
agencies
were
suddenly
flooded
with
reports
there
were
several
thousand
cases
of
the
plague
in
eastern
russia
the
north
and
south
were
affected
many
men
were
dying
in
such
towns
as
kharkov
and
rostov
there
were
a
dozen
cases
in
st
petersburg
there
was
a
such
a
rush
of
reports
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
distinguish
between
those
that
were
probably
true
and
those
that
were
certainly
false
the
morning
papers
gave
as
much
space
as
they
could
spare
and
had
even
broken
up
some
of
the
matter
dealing
with
the
arrangements
for
the
opening
of
parliament
on
that
day
but
the
evening
papers
had
news
that
put
all
previous
reports
in
the
shade
eleven
more
cases
were
reported
in
berlin
three
in
hamburg
five
in
prague
and
one
in
vienna
but
more
important
more
thrilling
still
was
the
news
that
the
grand
duke
kirylo
the
tsar
younger
brother
had
died
of
the
plague
in
moscow
and
professor
schlesinger
in
berlin
until
that
startling
announcement
came
the
english
public
had
incomprehensibly
imagined
that
only
peasants
chinamen
and
people
of
the
lower
social
grades
were
attacked
by
this
strange
new
infection
in
the
later
editions
it
was
reported
on
good
authority
that
professor
schlesinger
had
been
observing
a
sample
of
the
blood
of
the
first
case
of
plague
that
had
been
recognized
in
berlin
nevertheless
the
majority
of
readers
after
glancing
through
the
obituary
notices
of
the
grand
duke
kirylo
and
of
the
bacteriologist
turned
to
the
account
only
slightly
abbreviated
of
the
opening
of
parliament
and
in
many
households
the
subject
of
the
new
plague
gave
place
to
the
fiercely
controversial
topic
of
the
english
church
disestablishment
bill
which
had
been
indicated
in
the
king
speech
as
a
measure
that
was
to
be
introduced
in
the
forthcoming
session
many
opponents
of
the
bill
coupled
the
two
chief
items
of
news
and
said
that
the
plague
was
a
warning
against
infidelity
it
may
be
assumed
that
they
found
sufficient
warrant
for
the
killing
of
a
few
thousand
russians
including
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
a
great
german
scientist
in
the
acknowledged
importance
of
england
among
the
nations
the
death
of
half
a
million
or
so
chinamen
in
the
first
instance
had
been
a
delicate
hint
now
came
the
more
urgent
warning
who
knew
but
that
if
this
sacrilegious
bill
were
passed
england
herself
might
not
be
smitten
when
warnings
are
disregarded
judgments
follow
the
evangelicals
found
a
weapon
ready
to
their
hands
but
what
precisely
was
the
nature
of
the
new
plague
none
of
the
journals
was
as
yet
able
to
say
the
symptoms
had
not
as
yet
been
described
by
any
medical
authority
for
it
appeared
that
contrary
to
modern
precedent
the
doctor
himself
despite
all
precautions
was
peculiarly
subject
to
infection
out
of
the
eleven
new
cases
in
berlin
no
less
than
four
were
medical
men
from
the
layman
point
of
view
the
symptoms
were
briefly
as
follows
firstly
violent
pains
at
the
base
of
the
skull
followed
by
a
period
of
comparative
relief
which
lasted
from
two
to
five
hours
then
a
numbness
in
the
extremities
followed
by
rapid
paralysis
death
ensued
in
from
to
hours
after
the
pains
were
first
experienced
no
case
as
yet
was
known
to
have
recovered
a
physician
in
london
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
disease
was
a
hitherto
unknown
form
of
meningitis
of
unexampled
virulence
he
protested
that
the
word
plague
was
a
false
description
but
that
word
had
already
been
impressed
on
the
public
mind
and
the
disease
was
spoken
of
as
the
new
plague
until
the
end
the
next
morning
all
london
was
reading
a
article
by
jasper
thrale
it
appeared
first
in
the
daily
post
with
the
announcement
that
it
was
not
copyright
and
all
the
evening
papers
took
it
up
and
some
of
them
reprinted
it
in
its
entirety
the
article
began
by
pointing
out
that
in
the
recent
history
of
civilization
europe
had
been
subject
to
a
long
succession
of
pestilences
from
the
fourteenth
to
the
seventeenth
centuries
wrote
thrale
the
black
death
now
commonly
supposed
to
be
a
form
of
the
bubonic
plague
was
practically
endemic
in
england
in
more
recent
times
had
been
responsible
for
enormous
mortality
among
all
classes
and
in
our
own
day
tuberculosis
in
the
two
former
examples
thrale
pointed
out
and
in
many
other
diseases
infectious
or
contagious
or
both
these
pestilences
had
gradually
lost
virulence
by
the
elimination
of
those
most
susceptible
to
infection
and
incapable
to
resist
the
onslaught
of
the
disease
and
by
the
survival
of
those
whose
vitality
was
strong
enough
either
to
resist
attack
or
to
achieve
recovery
mankind
at
last
were
gradually
becoming
immune
against
certain
infections
which
had
prevailed
in
the
past
and
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
this
immunity
was
without
doubt
being
obtained
against
a
whole
host
of
lesser
ills
this
comparative
immunity
in
fact
was
one
of
the
means
of
man
evolution
towards
a
more
perfect
physical
body
but
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
wrote
thrale
the
appalling
danger
which
threatens
us
when
we
are
attacked
by
a
pestilence
which
is
entirely
new
to
humanity
new
so
far
as
we
know
to
the
world
in
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
black
death
is
recorded
in
some
places
to
have
killed
of
the
whole
population
and
notwithstanding
the
modern
improvement
in
sanitation
and
general
hygiene
there
is
no
inherent
reason
why
another
pestilence
may
not
appear
which
may
be
even
more
deadly
and
we
are
faced
at
the
present
moment
with
the
awful
threat
that
such
a
pestilence
has
appeared
the
pestilence
commonly
known
as
the
plague
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
consider
the
appearance
as
without
precedent
in
history
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
regard
its
coming
as
outside
the
laws
of
common
probability
finally
and
most
decisively
there
is
no
reason
why
england
should
not
be
smitten
according
to
report
among
the
chinese
this
plague
has
been
spasmodically
epidemic
in
tibet
for
more
than
a
century
we
have
as
yet
no
certain
facts
upon
which
to
base
any
hypothesis
but
is
it
not
credible
that
during
that
time
some
bacterium
or
bacillus
hitherto
harmlessly
parasitic
perhaps
in
the
blood
of
lower
animals
has
changed
its
life
habit
in
the
isolated
and
sparsely
inhabited
regions
of
tibet
it
is
possible
that
for
many
thousand
years
the
assumed
bacterium
was
never
bred
in
the
blood
of
man
it
is
possible
that
when
it
first
found
a
new
host
it
was
comparatively
harmless
to
him
but
within
a
hundred
years
it
may
have
become
so
altered
by
new
conditions
that
it
has
developed
into
what
is
practically
a
new
species
if
these
theories
are
relatively
true
it
is
not
unlikely
that
this
new
bacterium
is
working
out
its
own
destruction
by
the
destruction
of
its
hosts
it
may
be
that
it
is
one
of
those
blind
alleys
of
evolution
which
reach
a
certain
stage
of
development
and
then
disappear
but
meanwhile
what
of
mankind
we
know
so
little
of
the
history
of
microscopic
life
there
is
a
whole
world
of
evolution
in
process
of
which
we
have
no
conception
and
at
this
stage
whether
my
hypothesis
be
a
possible
one
or
not
we
are
at
least
sure
that
an
unknown
organism
animal
or
vegetable
has
become
visible
to
us
in
its
effects
and
may
alter
the
whole
history
of
mankind
i
lay
stress
on
these
aspects
because
we
are
so
so
restricted
so
conventional
in
our
ideas
that
we
assume
without
thought
that
the
process
of
life
as
we
know
of
it
from
a
few
thousand
years
of
history
can
never
be
interrupted
in
our
few
years
of
individual
existence
we
become
accustomed
to
certain
apparent
laws
of
cause
and
effect
and
will
not
believe
that
there
can
be
any
exception
to
those
assumed
laws
but
now
in
the
face
of
recent
evidence
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
we
should
realize
instantly
and
practically
that
we
are
threatened
with
a
new
factor
in
life
which
imperils
the
whole
human
race
it
is
no
longer
safe
to
comfort
ourselves
with
the
belief
begotten
of
our
vanity
that
the
world
was
necessarily
made
for
man
it
behoves
us
to
take
measures
for
our
protection
without
delay
to
undertake
our
own
cause
and
trust
no
longer
in
any
beneficent
providence
that
works
always
for
our
ultimate
benefit
these
measures
of
protection
are
clearly
indicated
we
must
close
our
doors
against
the
invasion
of
the
plague
quarantine
will
not
protect
us
we
must
have
no
traffic
with
europe
until
the
danger
is
past
by
the
happy
accident
of
our
position
we
can
become
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
we
must
close
our
doors
before
it
is
too
late
if
the
people
had
not
been
seriously
scared
by
the
sudden
irruption
of
news
on
the
day
preceding
that
on
which
this
article
was
published
they
would
have
ignored
thrale
hyperboles
or
laughed
but
caught
in
a
moment
of
agitation
and
fear
a
certain
section
of
the
crowd
took
up
thrale
suggestion
talked
about
the
closed
door
held
meetings
and
started
propaganda
the
press
with
its
genius
for
appreciating
and
following
public
opinion
also
took
up
the
suggestion
and
was
automatically
divided
into
two
sections
recognizable
as
liberal
and
conservative
the
times
took
command
of
the
situation
with
a
leader
in
which
thrale
argument
was
pounded
rather
than
picked
to
pieces
but
the
daily
mail
produced
more
effect
with
two
special
articles
contributed
one
by
a
bacteriologist
the
other
by
a
professor
of
economics
the
first
had
little
weight
all
argument
under
that
head
was
as
yet
founded
on
the
most
uncertain
hypotheses
the
second
was
so
convincing
that
the
less
ardent
supporters
of
the
closed
door
policy
were
shaken
in
their
convictions
the
writer
of
the
economic
article
pointed
out
that
an
england
with
closed
doors
could
not
feed
herself
for
a
month
he
was
scrupulously
fair
in
his
argument
and
was
at
great
pains
to
show
that
even
if
preparation
was
instantly
made
to
lay
in
large
stores
of
grain
from
canada
tinned
meats
from
america
and
generally
from
the
many
places
which
were
as
yet
free
from
any
taint
of
plague
it
would
still
be
impossible
to
provide
for
more
than
a
three
isolation
then
leaving
this
aspect
of
the
question
he
went
on
to
show
in
detail
that
even
if
the
food
could
be
supplied
the
practical
cessation
of
our
enormous
foreign
trade
would
mean
the
destruction
of
england
commerce
and
he
wound
up
with
an
earnest
exhortation
to
the
country
at
large
warning
the
people
to
beware
of
scaremongers
pessimists
and
opportunists
who
had
their
own
ends
to
serve
and
cared
nothing
for
the
general
welfare
it
was
an
excellent
article
in
every
way
quite
one
of
the
best
that
the
daily
mail
had
ever
published
and
as
this
too
was
declared
free
of
any
copyright
restrictions
it
was
largely
circulated
the
daily
post
replied
next
morning
by
pointing
out
that
the
celebrated
professor
of
economics
was
nullifying
all
his
own
previous
utterances
on
the
case
for
tariff
reform
but
that
retort
carried
little
weight
no
one
cared
if
the
professor
contradicted
himself
anyone
except
the
faddists
could
see
that
the
argument
of
the
article
was
sound
in
fact
incontrovertible
what
had
to
be
done
was
to
put
pressure
on
the
local
government
board
it
was
true
that
the
daily
post
the
organ
of
the
government
affirmed
that
the
board
in
question
was
alert
and
active
but
that
announcement
was
regarded
as
a
cliché
what
was
wanted
were
particulars
of
the
preventive
measures
that
were
being
taken
the
members
of
the
great
gosling
family
in
offices
warehouses
and
shops
followed
the
line
of
least
resistance
while
making
some
assertion
of
their
rights
as
citizens
george
gosling
arguments
with
his
crony
flack
were
excellently
representative
what
yer
think
of
this
door
business
asked
flack
goin
a
bit
too
far
in
my
opinion
returned
gosling
judicially
flack
natural
incredulity
had
inclined
him
in
the
same
direction
but
his
colleague
certainty
swung
him
round
at
once
i
ai
so
sure
o
that
he
said
looks
to
me
as
things
is
going
pretty
bad
bad
enough
i
grant
you
returned
gosling
but
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
lose
our
over
it
take
it
all
round
you
know
it
pretty
certain
as
things
is
as
bad
as
is
made
out
whereas
on
the
other
the
door
policy
mean
ruin
and
starvation
for
of
thousands
there
no
gettin
round
that
better
a
few
thousands
than
the
male
population
said
flack
if
it
come
to
that
but
it
wo
no
fear
not
by
a
long
chalk
it
wo
replied
gosling
what
got
to
be
done
is
to
get
the
local
government
board
to
work
we
got
to
a
regular
system
quarantine
established
that
what
we
got
to
it
did
indeed
appear
the
most
practical
form
of
prevention
at
the
moment
it
is
hard
to
see
what
other
measures
could
have
been
adopted
the
supporters
of
the
closed
door
policy
soon
began
to
lose
adherents
the
scheme
was
obviously
alarmist
and
utterly
impracticable
through
february
and
the
early
part
of
march
the
plague
spread
through
central
europe
but
not
with
an
alarming
rapidity
in
the
second
week
of
march
berlin
was
reporting
a
weekly
roll
of
over
five
hundred
deaths
attributable
to
this
cause
and
vienna
was
second
with
between
four
and
five
hundred
in
st
petersburg
and
moscow
the
figures
were
no
higher
and
there
were
as
yet
comparatively
few
cases
in
france
and
none
in
spain
or
portugal
many
authorities
were
of
opinion
that
the
mortality
had
reached
the
maximum
and
that
the
plague
would
work
itself
out
in
the
course
of
a
few
more
weeks
moreover
it
appeared
that
the
early
reports
of
the
highly
infectious
character
of
the
plague
must
have
been
grossly
exaggerated
for
as
yet
there
had
been
not
a
single
case
in
the
british
isles
despite
the
enormous
traffic
between
england
and
the
continent
it
is
true
that
the
strictest
quarantine
had
been
established
it
had
been
ascertained
that
the
period
of
gestation
of
the
germ
was
about
fifty
hours
but
not
one
single
case
had
so
far
been
detained
in
quarantine
ships
or
hospitals
it
was
argued
from
this
that
the
plague
was
not
infectious
at
all
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
only
mildly
contagious
that
it
flourished
in
certain
centres
and
was
not
easily
transferable
from
one
centre
to
another
the
only
aspect
of
the
thing
that
was
seriously
alarming
was
the
horrible
mortality
among
doctors
and
the
specialists
who
were
endeavouring
to
recognize
and
isolate
the
characteristic
germ
of
the
disease
nine
english
experts
who
had
dared
martyrdom
in
the
cause
of
science
had
gone
to
berlin
to
make
investigations
and
not
one
of
them
had
returned
as
a
consequence
of
this
strange
susceptibility
of
the
investigator
whether
medical
man
or
bacteriologist
there
was
still
an
extraordinary
ignorance
of
the
general
nature
and
action
of
the
disease
nevertheless
despite
this
one
intimidating
aspect
of
the
plague
the
general
attitude
in
the
middle
of
march
was
that
the
quarantine
arrangements
were
enormously
impeding
trade
and
should
be
relaxed
the
foreign
governments
were
alive
to
the
seriousness
of
the
scourge
and
were
doing
all
in
their
power
to
prevent
infection
there
had
been
a
scare
but
people
were
calm
again
now
and
able
to
realize
the
extent
of
the
earlier
exaggerations
the
government
passed
the
second
reading
of
the
english
church
disestablishment
bill
by
a
majority
of
nineteen
before
the
easter
recess
and
the
goslings
who
had
grown
used
to
the
plague
whose
chief
attitude
towards
it
was
that
it
was
an
infernal
nuisance
which
interfered
with
trade
turned
their
attention
gladly
to
the
new
topic
they
all
thought
that
a
general
election
at
that
moment
would
result
in
an
overwhelming
conservative
majority
and
as
the
liberals
had
been
in
power
for
more
than
ten
years
that
eventuality
was
regarded
with
complacency
but
at
this
critical
moment
to
the
joy
of
the
evangelicals
the
new
plague
set
to
work
in
earnest
vi
disaster
russia
was
smitten
once
more
communication
was
cut
off
from
moscow
this
time
by
a
different
agent
the
work
of
the
city
was
paralysed
men
were
falling
dead
in
the
street
and
there
were
only
women
to
bury
them
a
wholesale
emigration
had
begun
the
roads
were
choked
with
people
on
foot
and
in
carriages
for
the
trains
had
ceased
to
run
the
news
filtered
in
by
degrees
it
was
confirmed
contradicted
and
definitely
confirmed
again
every
few
hours
then
came
final
confirmation
with
the
news
that
something
approaching
war
had
broken
out
a
war
of
defence
germany
had
sent
troops
to
the
frontier
to
stem
the
tide
of
emigrants
from
smitten
russia
and
poland
and
was
following
her
example
parliament
before
the
easter
recess
had
expired
the
time
for
more
drastic
measures
had
come
and
the
premier
explained
to
the
house
that
it
was
proposed
to
bring
in
a
bill
immediately
to
cut
off
communication
with
europe
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
england
was
now
badly
scared
but
centuries
of
protection
had
established
a
belief
in
security
which
was
not
easily
shaken
the
enthusiasts
for
the
closed
door
policy
found
plenty
of
recruits
but
on
the
other
side
there
was
a
solid
body
of
opinion
which
maintained
that
the
danger
was
grossly
exaggerated
and
when
the
evening
chronicle
came
out
with
a
long
leader
and
a
backing
of
expert
opinion
to
prove
that
the
closed
door
bill
as
it
was
commonly
called
was
a
dodge
of
the
government
in
order
to
retain
office
a
reaction
followed
against
the
last
and
terrible
step
of
cutting
off
all
communication
with
europe
and
the
conservative
party
was
joined
by
some
avowed
liberals
who
had
personal
interests
to
consider
in
this
connexion
in
members
of
the
opposition
were
inclined
to
be
jubilant
if
we
can
throw
out
the
government
on
this
bill
we
shall
simply
sweep
the
country
all
the
manufacturers
in
the
north
will
be
with
us
even
scotland
most
likely
we
should
come
back
with
a
record
majority
the
prospects
were
so
magnificent
that
there
could
be
no
hesitation
in
making
a
party
question
of
the
bill
no
time
was
to
be
lost
for
the
bill
was
to
be
rushed
it
was
an
emergency
measure
and
it
was
proposed
that
it
should
become
law
within
four
days
preparations
were
already
in
hand
to
carry
out
the
provisions
enacted
an
urgent
rally
of
the
opposition
was
made
and
when
the
bill
came
up
for
the
second
reading
the
premier
addressed
a
house
the
house
was
not
crowded
because
a
large
number
of
people
including
many
members
of
parliament
were
on
their
way
to
america
all
the
big
liners
were
packed
on
their
outward
voyage
and
were
returning
contrary
to
all
precedent
in
ballast
this
ballast
was
exclusively
the
premier
introduced
the
bill
in
a
speech
which
was
remarkable
for
its
sincerity
and
earnestness
he
outlined
the
arrangements
that
were
being
made
to
feed
the
community
and
showed
clearly
that
while
communication
remained
open
with
america
there
was
no
fear
of
any
serious
shortage
pausing
for
a
moment
on
this
question
of
intercourse
with
america
he
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
american
ports
were
already
closed
to
emigrants
from
all
european
countries
with
the
one
exception
of
great
britain
and
that
if
a
single
case
of
plague
were
reported
in
these
islands
the
difficulties
of
obtaining
from
america
and
the
colonies
would
be
enormously
increased
he
wound
up
by
almost
imploring
the
house
not
to
make
a
party
question
of
so
urgent
and
necessary
a
measure
at
a
time
when
the
safety
of
england
was
so
terribly
threatened
he
pleaded
that
at
this
critical
moment
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
humanity
it
was
the
duty
of
every
man
to
sink
his
own
personal
interests
to
be
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
the
community
mr
brampton
the
leader
of
the
opposition
then
completely
destroyed
the
undoubted
effect
which
had
been
made
upon
the
house
he
did
not
openly
speak
in
a
party
spirit
but
he
hinted
very
plainly
that
the
bill
under
consideration
was
a
mere
subterfuge
to
win
votes
he
poured
contempt
upon
the
fear
of
the
plague
which
he
characterized
throughout
as
the
russian
epidemic
and
ended
with
the
advice
to
keep
a
cool
head
to
preserve
the
british
spirit
of
sturdy
resistance
instead
of
shutting
our
doors
and
bringing
the
country
to
commercial
ruin
are
we
all
cravens
he
concluded
scurrying
like
rabbits
to
our
burrows
at
the
first
hint
of
alarm
the
further
debate
although
lengthy
had
comparatively
little
influence
the
house
divided
and
the
government
was
defeated
by
a
majority
of
nine
the
news
was
all
over
the
country
by
ten
that
night
and
it
was
noticeable
that
a
large
percentage
of
the
younger
generation
still
regarded
the
danger
as
rather
a
lark
this
threat
of
the
plague
held
a
promise
of
high
adventure
youth
can
only
realize
the
possibility
of
death
in
its
relation
to
others
i
say
if
this
bally
old
plague
did
come
remarked
a
young
man
of
who
was
sitting
with
a
friend
in
the
little
private
bar
of
the
dun
taw
hotel
his
friend
drew
his
feet
up
on
to
the
rungs
of
his
tall
stool
and
winked
at
the
barmaid
well
go
on
what
if
it
did
remarked
that
young
woman
the
young
man
considered
for
a
moment
and
then
said
those
that
got
left
would
have
a
rare
old
time
it
the
women
as
get
left
seems
to
me
replied
the
barmaid
and
scored
a
point
i
say
surely
you
do
come
from
this
part
of
the
world
was
the
compliment
evoked
by
her
wit
not
me
was
the
answer
i
a
londoner
i
am
only
started
yesterday
and
stay
long
if
a
fair
sample
there
been
a
dozen
customers
in
all
day
and
they
were
in
such
a
to
get
their
tonic
and
go
that
i
sure
they
could
told
you
whether
me
was
black
or
both
men
immediately
looked
at
the
crown
of
pretty
fair
hair
which
had
been
so
churlishly
slighted
first
thing
i
noticed
about
you
said
one
the
other
who
had
hardly
spoken
before
took
the
cigarette
out
of
his
mouth
and
remarked
you
can
never
get
that
colour
with
peroxide
the
barmaid
looked
a
little
suspicious
oh
he
means
it
all
right
kid
put
in
the
younger
man
quickly
dicky
one
of
the
serious
sort
besides
he
in
that
line
travels
for
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists
dicky
nodded
gravely
i
could
see
at
once
it
was
natural
he
remarked
with
the
air
of
an
expert
ah
you
one
of
them
that
keeps
their
eyes
open
returned
the
barmaid
approvingly
and
dicky
modestly
acknowledged
the
compliment
by
saying
that
his
business
necessitated
close
observation
most
men
are
as
blind
as
bats
continued
the
barmaid
and
the
examples
she
gave
from
her
own
experience
led
to
an
absorbing
conversation
which
was
presently
interrupted
by
the
shriek
of
the
swing
door
the
was
a
small
fair
man
with
a
neatly
waxed
moustache
he
came
up
to
the
counter
with
the
air
of
an
habitué
and
remarked
hallo
where
cis
you
new
here
are
you
the
barmaid
recognizing
the
marks
of
a
regular
customer
quietly
admitted
that
this
was
only
her
second
day
at
the
dun
taw
i
been
away
for
two
months
explained
the
fair
man
and
ordered
scotch
he
was
evidently
in
the
mood
for
company
for
he
brought
up
a
stool
and
sitting
a
little
way
back
from
the
bar
he
began
to
address
his
three
hearers
at
large
only
came
back
from
europe
this
evening
he
said
and
glad
to
be
home
i
assure
you
he
raised
his
left
hand
with
a
gesture
intended
to
convey
horror
and
drank
half
his
whisky
at
a
gulp
dicky
turned
to
give
his
serious
attention
to
the
narrative
which
was
plainly
to
follow
and
somewhat
ostentatiously
observed
the
details
of
the
dress
dicky
had
a
reputation
to
maintain
his
friend
looked
bored
and
a
little
sulky
and
tried
to
continue
his
conversation
with
the
barmaid
but
that
young
woman
appreciating
the
difference
in
value
between
a
casual
and
a
regular
customer
passed
a
broad
hint
by
with
a
smile
and
said
europe
just
fancy
it
a
place
to
get
out
of
i
assure
you
said
the
fair
man
been
over
there
for
two
months
germany
and
austria
chiefly
but
for
the
last
fortnight
i
been
wasting
my
time
there
nothing
doing
is
there
commented
dicky
with
great
seriousness
oh
we
sick
to
death
of
this
bally
plague
put
in
the
other
young
man
quickly
there
been
simply
nothing
else
in
the
papers
for
the
last
i
do
know
how
long
i
want
to
forget
it
the
fair
man
reached
forward
and
put
down
his
empty
glass
on
the
bar
counter
same
again
miss
he
said
and
then
we
all
be
more
sick
of
the
plague
before
we
finished
with
it
it
a
terror
if
i
was
to
tell
you
a
few
of
the
things
i
seen
in
the
past
fortnight
i
do
suppose
you
believe
me
that
all
right
i
believe
you
quick
enough
returned
the
young
man
point
is
what
the
good
of
getting
yourself
in
a
funk
about
it
personally
i
do
believe
it
coming
to
england
if
it
was
it
would
have
been
here
before
this
what
i
say
is
his
pronouncement
of
opinion
ceased
abruptly
the
fair
man
behaviour
riveted
attention
he
was
gazing
past
the
barmaid
at
the
orderly
rows
of
shining
glasses
and
various
shaped
bottles
behind
her
his
mouth
was
open
he
gazed
intensely
horribly
the
barmaid
backed
nervously
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
the
two
young
men
hastily
rose
and
pushed
back
their
stools
the
same
thought
was
in
all
their
minds
this
neat
fair
man
was
on
the
verge
of
delirium
tremens
in
a
moment
the
air
of
intercourse
and
joviality
that
had
pervaded
the
little
room
was
dissipated
in
place
of
it
had
come
shocked
surprise
and
fear
there
was
an
interval
of
slow
desolating
silence
and
then
the
convulsive
grip
of
the
fair
man
shattered
the
glass
he
held
and
the
fragments
fell
tinkling
to
the
floor
i
say
what
up
stammered
the
barmaid
admirer
while
the
barmaid
herself
shrank
back
against
the
shelves
and
watched
nervously
she
had
had
experience
the
fair
man
head
was
being
pulled
slowly
backwards
by
some
invisible
force
his
eyes
staring
straight
before
him
appeared
to
watch
with
fierce
intensity
some
point
that
moved
steadily
up
the
wall
of
shelves
behind
the
counter
up
till
it
reached
the
ceiling
and
began
to
move
over
the
ceiling
toward
him
then
quite
suddenly
the
horrible
tension
was
relaxed
his
head
fell
loosely
forward
and
he
clapped
both
hands
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
he
was
breathing
loudly
in
short
quick
gasps
i
say
do
you
think
he
ill
asked
the
young
man
at
the
suggestion
dicky
made
a
step
towards
the
sufferer
his
knowledge
of
chemistry
gave
him
a
professional
air
he
come
from
europe
suppose
it
the
plague
whispered
the
barmaid
and
at
that
the
two
young
men
started
back
as
the
words
were
spoken
realization
swept
upon
them
mumbling
something
about
get
a
doctor
they
rushed
for
the
door
one
of
them
made
a
wide
détour
he
had
to
pass
the
man
who
sat
doubled
forward
in
his
chair
frantically
gripping
the
base
of
his
skull
hardly
had
the
clatter
of
the
swing
door
subsided
before
he
fell
forward
on
to
the
floor
he
was
groaning
now
groaning
detestably
the
barmaid
whimpered
and
stared
women
do
get
it
she
said
aloud
but
she
kept
to
her
own
side
of
the
counter
later
the
owner
of
the
dun
taw
identified
the
fair
man
from
a
distance
as
mr
stewart
of
the
firm
of
barker
and
prince
thrale
higher
forces
had
shown
their
hand
the
humble
and
rotund
instrument
of
their
choice
had
served
his
purpose
and
he
was
probably
the
first
man
in
london
to
receive
the
news
a
delicate
acknowledgment
perhaps
of
his
services
the
telegram
was
addressed
to
the
firm
but
as
neither
of
the
heads
of
the
house
had
arrived
gosling
opened
it
according
to
precedent
gosh
was
his
sole
exclamation
but
the
tone
of
it
stirred
the
interest
of
flack
who
turned
to
see
his
colleague
rather
protuberant
blue
eyes
staring
with
a
fishy
glare
at
a
flimsy
sheet
of
paper
which
visibly
trembled
in
the
hold
of
two
clusters
of
fat
fingers
flack
lifted
his
spectacles
and
holding
them
on
a
level
with
his
eyebrows
said
bad
news
gosling
sat
down
and
in
the
fever
of
the
moment
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
snuff
handkerchief
then
discovered
his
mistake
and
laid
the
handkerchief
carelessly
on
the
desk
this
infringement
of
his
invariable
practice
produced
even
more
effect
upon
flack
than
the
staring
eyes
and
wavering
fingers
gosling
might
be
guilty
of
mild
histrionics
but
not
of
such
a
touch
as
this
the
utter
neglect
of
decency
exhibited
by
the
display
of
that
shameful
bandanna
could
only
portend
calamity
lord
sakes
man
what
the
matter
asked
flack
still
taking
an
observation
under
his
spectacles
it
come
flack
said
gosling
feebly
it
in
scotland
our
mr
stewart
died
of
it
in
dundee
this
mornin
flack
rose
from
his
seat
and
grabbed
the
telegram
which
was
brief
and
pregnant
stewart
died
suddenly
five
feared
plague
macfie
tchah
said
flack
still
staring
at
the
telegram
plague
lost
their
that
what
they
done
pull
yourself
together
man
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
gosling
swallowed
elaborately
discovered
his
bandanna
on
the
desk
and
hastily
pocketed
it
might
been
think
he
said
eagerly
remarked
flack
i
never
as
was
affected
did
you
gosling
held
out
his
hand
for
the
telegram
and
made
a
further
elaborate
study
of
it
without
however
discovering
any
hitherto
unsuspected
evidence
relating
to
the
unsoundness
of
stewart
heart
it
says
of
course
he
remarked
at
last
macfie
have
said
feared
if
been
sure
they
have
mentioned
plague
in
a
telegram
if
they
been
pretty
certain
though
argued
flack
gosling
was
so
upset
that
he
had
to
go
out
and
get
a
nip
of
brandy
a
thing
he
had
not
done
since
the
morning
after
blanche
was
born
the
partners
looked
grave
when
they
heard
the
news
from
dundee
and
london
generally
looked
very
grave
indeed
when
they
read
the
full
details
an
hour
later
in
the
evening
chronicle
stewart
it
appeared
had
come
straight
through
from
berlin
to
london
via
flushing
and
port
victoria
and
on
landing
in
england
he
had
managed
to
escape
quarantine
his
was
not
an
isolated
case
for
some
weeks
it
had
been
possible
for
british
subjects
to
get
past
the
officials
there
was
nothing
in
the
regulations
to
allow
such
an
evasion
of
the
order
but
it
could
be
managed
occasionally
stewart
had
been
told
to
spare
no
expense
the
evening
chronicle
although
it
made
the
most
of
its
opportunity
in
contents
bill
and
headlines
said
that
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
that
these
things
were
managed
better
in
great
britain
than
on
the
continent
that
the
case
had
been
isolated
from
the
first
moment
the
plague
was
recognized
about
five
hours
before
death
that
the
body
had
been
burned
and
that
the
most
extensive
and
elaborate
process
of
disinfection
was
being
carried
out
even
the
sleeping
coach
in
which
stewart
had
travelled
from
london
to
dundee
twelve
hours
before
had
been
identified
and
burned
also
london
still
looked
grave
but
was
nevertheless
a
little
inclined
to
congratulate
itself
on
the
thoroughness
of
british
methods
never
get
it
in
england
you
see
if
we
do
was
the
remark
chiefly
in
vogue
among
the
great
gosling
family
but
twelve
hours
or
so
too
late
england
was
beginning
to
regret
that
the
government
had
been
defeated
it
was
rumoured
that
the
premier
had
broken
down
had
immediately
resigned
his
office
and
would
not
seek
as
a
private
member
this
rumour
was
definitely
confirmed
in
the
later
editions
of
the
evening
papers
mr
brampton
had
been
summoned
to
buckingham
palace
and
was
forming
a
temporary
ministry
which
was
to
take
office
in
the
circumstances
it
was
deemed
inadvisable
to
plunge
the
country
into
a
general
election
at
that
moment
mr
stewart
died
in
the
small
hours
of
friday
morning
and
the
next
day
saturday
the
of
april
was
the
first
day
of
panic
the
day
began
with
comparative
quiet
no
further
case
had
been
notified
in
great
britain
but
telegraphic
communication
was
interrupted
between
london
and
russia
prague
vienna
budapest
and
other
continental
centres
in
germany
matters
were
growing
desperate
there
had
been
riots
and
looting
military
law
had
been
declared
in
several
towns
in
some
cases
the
mob
had
been
fired
upon
business
was
at
a
standstill
and
the
plague
was
spreading
like
a
fire
between
two
and
three
hundred
cases
were
reported
from
reims
and
upwards
of
fifty
from
paris
business
houses
were
being
closed
in
the
city
of
london
and
the
banks
noted
a
marked
tendency
among
their
depositors
to
withdraw
gold
so
marked
indeed
that
many
banks
of
high
standing
were
glad
to
be
able
to
close
their
doors
at
one
it
was
on
this
saturday
morning
also
that
the
bottom
suddenly
fell
out
of
the
money
market
for
weeks
past
prices
had
been
falling
steadily
but
now
they
dropped
to
panic
figures
every
one
was
selling
there
were
no
buyers
left
consols
were
quoted
at
the
air
of
london
was
heavy
with
foreboding
and
throughout
the
morning
the
gloom
grew
deeper
the
depressed
and
worried
faces
to
be
met
at
every
turn
contrasted
strangely
with
the
brilliance
of
the
weather
for
april
had
come
with
clear
skies
and
soft
warm
winds
as
the
day
advanced
the
atmosphere
of
depression
became
continually
more
marked
and
how
extraordinary
was
the
effect
upon
all
classes
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
less
than
people
paid
to
witness
the
third
replay
between
barnsley
and
everton
in
the
of
the
english
cup
in
london
men
and
women
hung
aimlessly
about
the
streets
waiting
for
the
news
they
dreaded
to
hear
the
theatres
were
deserted
the
feeling
of
gloom
was
so
real
that
many
women
afterwards
believed
that
the
sky
had
been
overcast
whereas
nature
was
in
one
of
her
most
brilliant
moods
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
three
when
the
pressure
was
exploded
by
the
report
of
the
final
catastrophe
two
more
cases
of
plague
in
dundee
and
one
in
edinburgh
was
the
first
announcement
that
would
have
been
enough
to
show
that
all
the
vaunted
precautions
had
been
useless
and
within
an
hour
came
the
notification
of
two
further
cases
before
six
eight
more
were
notified
in
dundee
three
more
in
edinburgh
and
one
in
newcastle
the
new
plague
had
reached
england
it
was
then
that
the
panic
began
vii
panic
gurney
when
he
left
his
office
on
that
saturday
was
influenced
by
the
general
depression
he
went
to
lunch
at
the
white
vine
in
the
haymarket
quite
determined
to
keep
himself
in
hand
to
argue
himself
out
of
his
low
spirits
he
made
a
beginning
at
once
every
one
seems
to
have
a
fit
of
the
blues
ernst
he
remarked
to
the
waiter
with
a
factitious
cheerfulness
ernst
less
polite
than
usual
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
is
enough
cause
already
he
said
have
you
had
bad
news
from
germany
asked
gurney
feeling
that
he
had
probably
been
rather
brutal
ach
gott
bald
keiner
mehr
da
blubbered
ernst
and
he
wept
without
restraint
as
he
arranged
the
table
occasionally
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
napkin
i
most
awfully
sorry
murmured
the
embarrassed
gurney
and
retreated
behind
the
horror
of
his
evening
paper
he
found
small
cause
for
rejoicing
there
however
and
discarded
it
as
soon
as
his
lunch
had
been
brought
by
the
ernst
i
wonder
what
mark
tapley
would
have
done
gurney
reflected
moodily
as
he
attacked
his
chop
there
were
few
other
people
in
the
restaurant
and
they
were
all
silent
and
engrossed
that
dreadful
cloud
hung
over
england
the
spirit
of
pestilence
threatened
to
take
substance
the
air
was
full
of
horror
that
might
at
any
moment
become
a
visible
shape
of
destruction
gurney
did
not
finish
his
lunch
he
lighted
a
cigarette
left
four
shillings
on
the
table
and
hurried
out
into
the
air
he
did
not
look
up
at
the
sky
as
he
turned
eastwards
towards
fleet
street
no
one
looked
up
at
the
sky
that
afternoon
heads
and
shoulders
were
burdened
by
an
invisible
weight
which
kept
all
eyes
on
the
ground
fleet
street
was
full
of
people
who
crowded
round
the
windows
of
newspaper
offices
not
with
the
eagerness
of
a
general
election
crowd
but
with
a
subdued
surliness
which
ever
and
again
broke
out
in
spurts
of
violent
temper
gurney
still
struggling
to
maintain
his
composure
found
himself
unreasonably
irritated
when
a
driver
shouted
at
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
it
seemed
to
gurney
that
to
be
knocked
down
and
run
over
was
preferable
to
being
shouted
at
the
noise
of
those
infernal
buses
was
unbearable
so
also
was
that
dreadful
patter
of
feet
upon
the
pavement
and
the
dull
murmur
of
mournful
voices
why
in
the
name
of
god
could
not
people
keep
quiet
he
bumped
into
some
one
on
the
pavement
as
he
scrambled
out
of
the
way
of
the
bus
and
the
man
swore
at
him
viciously
gurney
responded
and
then
discovered
that
the
man
was
known
to
him
hallo
he
said
you
hallo
responded
the
other
for
a
moment
they
stood
awkwardly
staring
then
gurney
said
any
more
news
the
man
who
was
a
of
the
westminster
gazette
shook
his
head
i
just
going
back
now
he
said
there
was
nothing
ten
minutes
ago
pretty
awful
is
it
remarked
gurney
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
hurried
away
presently
gurney
found
himself
wedged
among
the
crowd
watching
the
daily
chronicle
window
a
few
minutes
after
three
a
young
man
with
a
very
white
face
fastened
a
message
to
the
glass
there
was
a
rapid
constriction
of
the
crowd
those
behind
gurney
among
them
could
not
read
the
message
and
pressed
forward
there
were
cries
of
what
is
it
i
ca
see
read
it
out
then
those
in
front
gave
way
slightly
a
wave
of
eagerness
agitated
the
mass
of
watchers
and
the
news
ran
back
from
the
front
two
more
cases
of
plague
in
dundee
one
in
edinburgh
and
with
that
the
pressure
of
dread
was
suddenly
dissipated
giving
place
to
something
kinetic
dynamic
now
it
was
fear
that
took
the
people
by
the
throat
active
compelling
fear
men
looked
at
each
other
with
terror
and
something
of
hate
in
their
eyes
the
crowd
broke
and
melted
every
man
was
going
to
his
own
home
possessed
by
an
instinct
to
fly
before
it
was
too
late
gurney
shouldered
his
way
out
and
stopped
a
taxi
that
was
crawling
past
jermyn
street
he
said
the
driver
leaned
over
and
pointed
to
the
daily
chronicle
window
what
the
news
he
asked
the
plague
in
dundee
and
edinburgh
said
gurney
and
climbed
into
the
cab
and
slammed
the
door
gawd
muttered
the
driver
as
he
drove
recklessly
westwards
sitting
in
the
cab
finding
some
comfort
in
the
feeling
of
headlong
speed
gurney
was
debating
whether
he
would
not
charter
the
man
to
take
him
right
out
of
london
but
he
must
go
home
first
for
money
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
jermyn
street
he
met
jasper
thrale
have
you
heard
asked
gurney
excitedly
no
what
said
thrale
without
interest
there
are
two
more
cases
in
dundee
and
one
in
edinburgh
said
gurney
the
driver
of
the
cab
got
down
from
his
seat
and
looked
from
gurney
to
thrale
with
doubt
and
question
thrale
nodded
his
head
i
knew
it
was
sure
to
come
he
remarked
better
get
out
of
this
put
in
the
driver
yes
rather
agreed
gurney
where
to
asked
thrale
well
america
thrale
laughed
they
have
it
in
america
before
you
get
there
he
said
it
go
there
via
japan
and
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
it
said
the
driver
of
the
cab
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
nowhere
we
can
go
to
persisted
gurney
thrale
smiled
nowhere
in
this
world
he
said
this
plague
has
come
to
destroy
mankind
he
spoke
with
a
quiet
assurance
that
carried
conviction
the
driver
of
the
cab
scowled
may
as
well
a
run
for
my
money
first
then
he
said
and
thus
gave
utterance
to
the
thought
that
was
fermenting
in
many
other
minds
there
was
no
hope
of
escape
for
the
mass
only
the
rich
could
seek
railway
termini
and
take
train
for
liverpool
southampton
or
any
port
where
there
was
the
least
hope
of
finding
some
ship
to
take
them
out
of
europe
that
night
there
was
panic
and
riot
the
wealthy
classes
were
trying
to
escape
the
mob
was
trying
to
get
a
run
for
its
money
yet
very
little
real
mischief
was
done
two
or
three
companies
of
infantry
were
sufficient
to
clear
the
streets
and
not
more
than
forty
people
in
all
were
seriously
injured
in
downing
street
the
new
premier
sat
alone
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
wondered
what
could
be
done
to
stop
the
approach
of
the
pestilence
one
of
the
evening
papers
had
suggested
that
a
great
line
of
fire
should
be
built
across
the
north
of
england
the
premier
wondered
whether
that
scheme
were
feasible
he
had
never
held
high
office
before
he
did
not
know
how
to
deal
with
these
great
issues
all
his
political
life
he
had
learned
only
the
art
of
party
tactics
he
had
learned
that
art
very
well
he
was
a
master
of
debate
and
he
had
shown
a
wonderful
ability
to
judge
the
bent
of
the
public
mind
and
to
make
use
of
his
judgments
for
party
ends
but
now
that
any
action
of
his
was
divorced
from
its
accustomed
object
he
was
as
a
man
suddenly
forced
into
some
new
occupation
whenever
he
tried
to
think
of
some
means
to
stay
the
progress
of
the
plague
his
mind
automatically
began
to
consider
what
influence
the
adoption
of
such
means
would
have
upon
the
general
election
which
must
soon
come
a
line
of
fire
across
the
north
he
was
thinking
would
shut
off
the
whole
of
scotland
they
would
never
forgive
us
for
that
we
should
lose
the
entire
scottish
vote
it
bad
enough
as
it
is
he
sat
up
late
into
the
night
considering
what
policy
he
should
put
before
the
cabinet
he
tried
honestly
to
consider
the
position
apart
from
politics
but
his
mind
refused
to
work
in
that
way
in
jermyn
street
thrale
was
arguing
with
gurney
trying
to
persuade
him
into
a
philosophic
attitude
yes
i
suppose
there
absolutely
nothing
to
be
done
but
sit
down
and
wait
said
gurney
personally
returned
thrale
i
have
no
intention
of
spending
my
time
flying
from
country
to
country
like
a
marked
criminal
that
way
leads
to
insanity
i
seen
men
become
animals
before
now
under
the
influence
of
fear
yes
of
course
you
quite
right
agreed
gurney
one
must
exercise
after
all
it
only
death
and
not
such
a
terrible
death
at
that
he
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
restlessly
then
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
jermyn
street
was
almost
deserted
but
distant
sounds
of
shouting
came
from
the
direction
of
piccadilly
he
left
the
window
open
and
turned
back
into
the
room
it
so
infernally
hard
just
to
sit
still
and
wait
he
said
if
only
one
could
do
something
i
doubt
now
said
thrale
quietly
whether
one
could
ever
have
done
anything
the
public
and
the
government
took
my
warnings
in
the
characteristic
way
the
only
possible
way
in
which
you
could
expect
humanity
to
take
a
warning
a
thrill
of
fear
perhaps
in
some
cases
frank
incredulity
in
others
but
no
result
either
way
that
endured
for
an
hour
belief
in
national
and
personal
security
inertia
outside
the
routine
of
necessary
stereotyped
employment
these
things
are
essential
to
the
running
of
the
machine
i
suppose
they
are
agreed
gurney
absently
he
had
sat
down
again
and
was
sucking
automatically
at
an
extinguished
pipe
in
a
complex
civilization
went
on
thrale
any
initiative
on
the
part
of
the
individual
outside
his
own
tiny
sphere
of
energy
is
just
so
much
grit
in
the
machine
there
are
recognized
methods
they
may
not
be
the
best
the
most
efficient
but
they
are
accepted
and
understood
every
clerk
who
has
to
calculate
twelve
pence
to
the
shilling
knows
how
his
work
would
be
lightened
if
he
had
only
to
calculate
ten
but
he
accepts
that
difficulty
because
he
can
do
nothing
as
an
individual
to
introduce
the
decimal
system
and
that
spirit
of
acceptance
grows
upon
him
until
the
individual
has
the
characteristics
of
the
class
only
when
a
man
is
stirred
by
too
great
discomfort
does
he
open
his
eyes
to
the
possibility
of
initiative
then
come
labour
strikes
if
labour
had
a
sufficiency
of
ease
and
comfort
if
its
lot
were
not
so
violently
contrasted
with
that
of
even
the
labour
would
settle
down
to
complacency
but
the
contrast
is
too
great
and
to
attain
that
complacency
of
uninitiative
we
must
level
down
that
was
coming
that
would
have
come
if
this
plague
what
was
that
asked
gurney
excitedly
jumping
to
his
feet
did
you
hear
firing
he
went
to
the
window
again
and
leaned
out
from
piccadilly
came
the
sound
of
an
army
of
trampling
feet
of
confused
cries
and
shouting
by
god
there
a
riot
exclaimed
gurney
he
spoke
over
his
shoulder
thrale
joined
him
at
the
window
panic
he
said
senseless
hysterical
panic
it
wo
last
i
think
i
shall
go
out
of
london
said
gurney
i
sooner
sooner
die
in
the
country
i
think
he
withdrew
from
the
window
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
again
going
to
stampede
with
the
rest
of
asked
thrale
extraordinarily
infectious
thing
panic
i
do
think
it
that
exactly
hesitated
gurney
animal
fear
said
thrale
the
terror
of
the
wild
thing
threatened
with
the
unknown
the
runaway
horse
terrified
and
rushing
to
its
own
destruction
fly
fly
fly
from
the
threat
of
peril
as
you
did
once
on
the
prairies
when
to
fly
meant
safety
it
so
infernally
depressing
in
london
said
gurney
all
right
go
and
brood
on
death
in
the
country
replied
thrale
that
may
cheer
you
up
a
bit
but
take
my
advice
do
run
walk
at
a
snail
pace
and
check
the
least
tendency
to
hurry
once
you
begin
to
quicken
your
pace
you
will
find
yourself
hurrying
desperately
and
then
stampede
the
hell
of
terror
at
your
heels
after
all
you
know
you
may
survive
it
is
likely
that
every
man
will
die
gurney
caught
eagerly
at
that
no
no
of
course
it
is
he
said
but
would
one
be
much
more
likely
to
survive
if
one
were
living
in
the
country
or
by
the
sea
in
some
fairly
isolated
place
for
example
i
meant
to
go
down
to
cornwall
for
my
holiday
this
year
to
a
little
cottage
on
the
coast
about
four
miles
from
padstow
do
you
think
in
pure
air
and
healthy
surroundings
like
that
one
would
stand
a
better
chance
very
likely
said
thrale
carelessly
but
do
run
in
any
case
you
better
wait
till
the
middle
of
the
week
the
first
rush
will
be
over
then
yes
perhaps
i
go
on
wednesday
or
tuesday
thrale
smiled
grimly
well
good
night
he
said
i
going
to
bed
when
he
had
gone
gurney
went
to
the
window
again
the
sounds
of
riot
from
piccadilly
had
died
down
to
a
low
confused
murmur
a
whizzed
by
along
jermyn
street
and
two
people
passed
on
foot
a
man
and
a
woman
the
woman
was
leaning
heavily
on
the
man
arm
gurney
turned
once
more
to
his
pacing
of
the
room
he
was
trying
to
realize
the
unrealizable
fact
that
the
world
offered
no
refuge
for
a
full
hour
he
struggled
with
himself
with
that
new
strange
instinct
which
rose
up
and
urged
him
to
fly
for
his
life
at
last
weary
and
overborne
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
by
the
dying
fire
and
began
to
cry
like
a
lost
child
even
as
ernst
the
waiter
had
cried
the
panic
emigration
lasted
until
monday
evening
and
then
came
news
which
checked
and
stayed
the
rush
for
the
ports
of
liverpool
southampton
and
queenstown
the
plague
was
already
in
america
it
had
come
as
thrale
had
prophesied
from
the
west
at
the
docks
many
of
those
favoured
emigrants
who
had
secured
berths
hesitated
if
it
was
to
be
a
choice
between
death
in
america
and
death
in
england
they
preferred
to
die
at
home
yet
even
on
tuesday
morning
when
doubt
as
to
the
coming
of
the
plague
was
no
longer
possible
when
dundee
could
only
give
approximate
figures
of
the
seizures
in
that
town
reporting
them
as
not
less
than
a
thousand
when
it
was
evident
that
the
whole
of
scotland
was
becoming
infected
with
incredible
rapidity
and
two
cases
were
notified
as
far
south
as
durham
there
remained
still
an
enormous
body
of
people
who
stoutly
maintained
that
bad
as
things
were
the
danger
was
grossly
exaggerated
who
believed
that
the
danger
would
soon
pass
and
who
steadfast
to
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
continued
their
routine
wherever
it
was
possible
so
to
do
determined
to
resist
to
the
last
to
this
body
possibly
some
of
the
whole
urban
population
was
due
the
comparative
maintenance
of
law
and
order
in
face
of
the
growing
destitution
due
to
the
wholesale
closing
of
factories
warehouses
and
offices
necessitated
by
the
now
complete
cessation
of
foreign
trade
and
to
the
hoarding
of
food
stores
and
gold
which
was
already
so
marked
as
to
have
seriously
affected
the
commerce
not
dependent
on
foreign
sellers
and
buyers
a
semblance
of
ordinary
life
was
still
maintained
newspapers
were
issued
trains
and
were
running
theatres
and
were
open
and
many
normal
occupations
were
carried
on
yet
everything
was
infected
it
was
as
if
the
cloak
of
civilization
was
worn
more
loosely
crime
was
increasing
and
justice
was
relaxed
robberies
of
food
were
so
common
that
there
was
no
place
for
the
confinement
of
those
who
were
convicted
shopkeepers
were
becoming
at
once
more
reliant
upon
their
own
defences
and
less
scrupulous
in
their
dealings
with
customers
no
longer
could
the
protection
of
the
state
be
exclusively
relied
upon
the
citizen
was
becoming
lost
in
the
individual
public
opinion
was
being
resolved
into
individual
opinion
and
with
the
failing
of
the
great
restraint
every
man
was
developing
an
unsuspected
side
of
his
character
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
he
became
continually
less
civilized
more
conscious
of
possibilities
to
fulfill
tendencies
and
desires
he
began
to
understand
that
when
it
is
a
case
of
sauve
qui
peut
the
weakest
are
trampled
under
foot
so
the
cloak
of
civilization
gaped
and
showed
the
form
of
the
naked
man
with
all
its
blemishes
and
deformities
and
women
blenched
and
shuddered
for
woman
as
yet
was
little
if
at
all
altered
in
character
by
the
fear
that
was
brutalizing
man
her
faith
in
the
intrinsic
rectitude
of

viii
gurney
in
cornwall
gurney
alternative
to
flying
from
the
plague
was
to
run
away
from
himself
he
shirked
the
issue
in
his
conversations
with
thrale
shuffled
sophisticated
and
in
a
futile
endeavour
to
convince
his
companion
convinced
himself
that
his
reasoning
was
sound
and
his
motive
unprejudiced
it
was
not
until
the
following
thursday
however
that
he
took
train
to
cornwall
he
had
succeeded
in
realizing
between
two
and
three
hundred
pounds
in
gold
and
this
he
took
with
him
he
intended
to
lay
in
stores
of
flour
sugar
and
other
primary
necessities
to
buy
and
keep
two
or
three
cows
to
rear
chickens
to
grow
as
much
garden
produce
as
possible
especially
potatoes
and
generally
to
provide
against
the
coming
scarcity
of
food
and
the
cessation
of
transport
the
bungalow
on
the
shores
of
constantine
bay
to
which
he
departed
was
a
place
well
suited
to
the
carrying
out
of
these
prudent
arrangements
it
belonged
to
a
friend
of
his
who
was
rich
enough
to
indulge
his
whims
and
who
had
spent
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
building
the
place
and
enclosing
ground
but
who
rarely
occupied
the
bungalow
himself
and
was
too
careless
to
bother
about
letting
it
gurney
had
the
keys
in
his
possession
when
he
had
asked
his
friend
for
permission
to
spend
his
summer
holiday
there
he
had
been
told
to
use
the
place
as
if
it
were
his
own
jolly
good
thing
for
me
you
know
his
friend
had
said
keep
it
dry
and
all
that
gurney
was
not
an
idle
man
arrived
at
his
bungalow
he
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
the
arrangements
he
had
schemed
and
for
nearly
three
weeks
he
was
so
absorbed
in
this
work
in
learning
new
occupations
and
perfecting
his
plan
that
he
did
indeed
achieve
his
purpose
of
running
away
from
himself
he
became
imbued
with
a
new
feeling
of
security
he
received
neither
letters
nor
papers
from
the
outside
and
the
old
labourer
who
assisted
him
in
setting
potatoes
who
taught
him
to
milk
a
cow
and
instructed
him
generally
in
the
primitive
arts
of
toil
seemed
to
regard
all
rumours
of
the
new
plague
which
filtered
through
to
the
village
of
st
merryn
as
some
foreign
nonsense
which
had
little
bearing
on
life
in
the
county
of
cornwall
as
represented
by
the
or
thirty
square
miles
which
were
to
him
all
the
essential
world
gurney
began
to
believe
that
the
plague
would
never
cross
the
tamar
and
one
day
in
early
may
when
his
provisions
against
a
siege
were
practically
completed
he
was
stirred
to
attempt
a
journey
across
the
peninsula
in
order
to
visit
an
acquaintance
in
east
looe
gurney
had
become
conscious
of
a
longing
for
some
companionship
old
hawken
was
very
good
at
cows
and
potatoes
but
he
was
rather
deaf
and
his
range
of
ideas
was
severely
restricted
from
padstow
to
looe
is
not
an
ideal
journey
by
rail
at
the
best
of
times
involving
as
it
does
a
change
of
train
at
wadebridge
bodmin
road
and
liskeard
but
gurney
was
in
no
hurry
and
the
conversations
he
overheard
in
his
compartment
were
not
destructive
of
his
complacency
there
was
indeed
some
mention
of
the
plague
but
only
in
relation
to
the
scarcity
of
food
supply
and
its
effect
on
trade
one
passenger
very
obviously
a
farmer
was
congratulating
himself
that
he
was
getting
higher
prices
for
stock
than
he
had
ever
known
and
that
as
luck
would
have
it
he
had
sown
an
unusual
number
of
acres
with
wheat
that
year
i
be
gettun
sixty
or
seventy
a
quarter
sure
he
boasted
dickenson
gurney
friend
in
looe
regarded
the
matter
more
seriously
but
he
too
seemed
untouched
by
any
fear
of
personal
infection
he
was
an
ardent
liberal
and
his
chief
cause
for
concern
seemed
to
be
that
the
plague
should
have
come
at
a
time
when
so
much
progress
was
being
made
with
legislation
he
was
also
very
distressed
at
the
reports
of
poverty
and
starvation
which
abounded
and
at
the
terrible
blow
to
trade
generally
but
he
seemed
hopeful
that
the
trouble
would
pass
and
be
followed
by
a
new
era
of
enlightened
government
founded
on
sound
liberal
principles
gurney
stayed
the
night
and
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
at
looe
on
his
return
journey
he
had
to
wait
at
liskeard
to
pick
up
the
main
line
train
for
london
which
would
take
him
to
bodmin
road
it
was
a
glorious
may
evening
the
day
had
been
hot
but
now
there
was
a
cool
breeze
from
the
sea
and
the
long
shadow
from
the
high
bank
of
the
cutting
enwrapped
the
whole
station
in
a
pleasant
twilight
gurney
deliberately
pacing
the
length
of
the
platform
was
conscious
of
physical
vigour
and
a
great
enjoyment
of
life
he
had
an
imaginative
temperament
and
in
his
moments
of
exaltation
he
found
the
world
both
interesting
and
beautiful
an
entirely
desirable
setting
for
the
essential
gurney
so
he
strolled
up
and
down
the
platform
regarded
any
female
figure
with
interest
and
was
in
no
way
concerned
that
the
train
was
already
an
hour
late
he
had
expected
it
to
be
late
his
own
train
from
looe
for
no
particular
reason
had
been
half
an
hour
late
if
he
missed
his
connexion
at
wadebridge
he
would
only
have
some
seven
or
eight
miles
to
walk
fifteen
or
twenty
other
people
were
waiting
on
the
down
platform
and
presently
gurney
became
conscious
that
his
were
no
longer
detached
into
parties
of
two
and
three
but
were
collected
in
groups
discussing
apparently
some
matter
of
peculiar
interest
gurney
had
been
lost
in
his
dreams
and
had
hardly
noticed
the
passage
of
time
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
that
the
train
was
now
two
hours
overdue
the
sun
had
set
but
there
was
still
light
in
the
sky
a
man
detached
himself
from
one
of
the
groups
and
gurney
approached
him
two
hours
late
he
remarked
by
way
of
introducing
himself
and
looked
at
his
watch
again
the
man
nodded
emphatically
funny
thing
is
he
said
that
had
no
information
at
the
office
the
stationmaster
generally
gets
advice
when
the
train
leaves
plymouth
good
lord
said
gurney
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
train
got
to
plymouth
yet
looks
like
it
said
the
stranger
they
say
it
the
plague
dreadfully
bad
in
london
they
tell
me
mean
it
possible
the
train
wo
come
in
at
all
asked
gurney
oh
i
should
hardly
think
that
replied
the
other
oh
no
i
should
hardly
think
that
but
goodness
knows
when
it
will
come
very
awkward
for
me
i
want
to
get
to
st
ives
it
a
long
way
from
here
have
you
far
to
go
well
padstow
said
gurney
padstow
echoed
the
stranger
that
a
good
step
further
than
i
want
to
walk
i
should
say
thirty
miles
or
so
anyway
about
that
agreed
gurney
i
wonder
where
one
could
get
any
information
it
very
awkward
was
all
the
help
the
stranger
had
to
offer
gurney
crossed
the
line
and
invaded
the
stationmaster
office
sorry
to
trouble
you
he
said
but
do
you
think
this
train
been
taken
off
for
any
reason
oh
it
been
taken
off
said
the
stationmaster
with
a
wounded
air
it
may
be
a
bit
late
gurney
smiled
it
something
over
two
hours
behind
now
it
he
said
well
i
ca
it
can
i
asked
the
stationmaster
to
patience
you
had
no
advice
yet
from
plymouth
persisted
gurney
facing
the
other
no
i
something
gone
wrong
with
the
wire
we
ca
get
no
answer
returned
the
stationmaster
now
if
you
please
i
my
work
to
do
gurney
returned
to
the
down
platform
and
joined
a
group
of
men
among
whom
he
recognized
the
man
he
had
spoken
to
a
few
minutes
before
the
afterglow
was
dying
out
of
the
sky
in
the
a
faint
young
moon
was
setting
behind
the
high
bank
of
the
cutting
a
porter
had
lighted
the
station
lamps
but
they
were
not
turned
full
on
the
stationmaster
tells
me
that
something
has
gone
wrong
with
the
telegraphic
communication
said
gurney
addressing
the
little
knot
of
passengers
collectively
he
ca
get
any
answer
it
seems
been
an
accident
likely
suggested
some
one
or
the
got
the
plague
said
another
they
have
put
another
man
on
if
they
could
find
one
if
we
ai
careful
we
shall
be
gettin
the
plague
down
after
all
why
not
the
horrible
suggestion
sprang
up
in
mind
with
new
force
that
remote
city
seemed
suddenly
near
he
saw
in
imagination
the
train
leaving
paddington
and
only
a
journey
of
six
or
seven
hours
divided
that
departure
from
its
arrival
at
liskeard
it
might
come
in
at
any
moment
bearing
the
awful
infection
why
should
he
wait
there
was
an
inn
near
the
station
he
might
find
a
conveyance
there
constantine
bay
questioned
the
landlord
it
near
st
merryn
said
gurney
but
still
the
landlord
shook
his
head
not
far
from
padstow
explained
gurney
exclaimed
the
landlord
on
a
rising
note
drive
over
to
at
this
time
o
night
he
appeared
to
think
that
gurney
was
joking
well
bodmin
then
suggested
gurney
aw
why
not
take
the
train
asked
the
landlord
gurney
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
train
does
seem
to
be
coming
he
said
bad
job
that
answered
the
landlord
been
an
accident
sure
this
new
plague
or
something
he
was
evidently
prepared
to
accept
the
matter
philosophically
you
ca
drive
me
then
asked
gurney
the
landlord
shook
his
head
with
a
grin
he
was
inclined
to
look
upon
this
foreigner
as
rather
more
foolish
than
the
majority
of
his
kind
gurney
came
out
of
the
little
inn
and
looked
down
into
the
station
the
number
of
waiting
passengers
seemed
to
be
decreasing
but
the
light
was
so
dim
that
he
could
not
see
into
the
shadows
i
must
keep
hold
of
myself
he
was
saying
i
must
run
a
man
was
coming
up
the
steep
incline
towards
him
and
gurney
moved
slowly
to
meet
him
he
found
that
it
was
the
stranger
he
had
spoken
to
on
the
platform
any
news
asked
gurney
yes
they
got
a
message
through
from
saltash
replied
the
stranger
it
the
plague
right
enough
they
say
they
do
know
when
there
be
another
train
days
grew
into
weeks
and
still
there
were
no
trains
trade
was
at
a
standstill
and
the
prices
of
home
produce
mounted
steadily
fish
there
was
but
not
in
great
abundance
and
the
towns
inland
such
as
truro
and
bodmin
organized
a
motor
service
with
coast
fishing
villages
a
service
which
only
lasted
for
a
week
by
reason
of
the
failure
of
the
petrol
supply
after
that
there
was
a
less
effective
horse
service
within
three
weeks
after
that
last
train
arrived
from
outside
a
new
system
of
exchange
was
coming
into
vogue
in
this
little
congeries
of
communities
in
cornwall
men
were
beginning
to
learn
the
uselessness
of
gold
silver
and
bronze
coins
as
tokens
credit
had
collapsed
and
a
system
of
barter
was
being
introduced
mainly
between
farmer
and
fisherman
in
time
it
was
possible
that
cornwall
might
have
become
a
community
for
its
proportionately
few
inhabitants
were
rapidly
being
depleted
by
want
and
starvation
but
although
it
was
the
last
place
in
the
british
isles
to
become
infected
the
plague
came
there
too
in
the
end
a
steamer
sent
out
from
cardiff
on
a
plundering
expedition
carried
the
plague
to
the
scillies
and
a
fishing
vessel
from
st
ives
carried
it
on
to
newlyn
ix
the
devolution
of
george
gosling
the
progress
of
the
plague
through
london
and
the
world
in
general
was
marked
in
the
earlier
stages
by
much
the
same
developments
as
are
reported
of
the
plague
of
the
closed
houses
the
burial
pits
the
deserted
streets
the
outbreaks
of
every
kind
of
excess
the
various
symptoms
of
fear
cowardice
fortitude
and
courage
evidenced
little
change
in
the
average
of
humanity
between
the
seventeenth
and
the
twentieth
centuries
the
most
notable
difference
during
these
earlier
stages
was
in
the
enormously
increased
rapidity
with
which
the
population
of
london
was
reduced
to
starvation
point
even
before
the
plague
had
reached
england
want
had
become
general
so
general
indeed
as
to
have
demonstrated
very
clearly
the
truth
of
the
great
economist
contention
that
england
could
not
exist
for
three
months
with
closed
doors
the
coming
of
the
plague
threw
london
on
to
its
own
very
limited
resources
that
vast
city
which
produced
nothing
but
the
tokens
of
wealth
and
added
nothing
to
the
essentials
that
support
life
was
instantly
reduced
to
the
state
of
paris
in
the
winter
of
with
the
difference
however
that
london
population
could
be
decreased
rapidly
by
emigration
and
was
also
even
more
rapidly
decreased
by
pestilence
yet
there
was
a
large
section
of
the
population
which
clung
with
blind
obstinacy
to
the
only
life
it
knew
how
to
live
there
was
for
instance
george
gosling
more
fortunate
in
many
respects
than
the
average
citizen
who
clung
desperately
to
his
house
in
wisteria
grove
until
forced
out
of
it
by
the
lack
of
water
on
the
ninth
day
after
the
first
coming
of
the
plague
to
london
it
appeared
simultaneously
in
a
dozen
places
and
spread
with
fearful
rapidity
gosling
broke
one
of
the
great
laws
he
had
hitherto
observed
with
such
admirable
prudence
the
offices
and
warehouse
in
barbican
had
been
shut
up
temporarily
it
was
supposed
and
the
partners
had
disappeared
from
london
but
gosling
had
a
duplicate
set
of
keys
and
inspired
by
the
urgency
of
his
family
need
he
determined
to
dare
a
journey
into
the
city
in
order
to
borrow
he
laid
great
stress
on
the
word
a
few
necessaries
of
life
from
the
warehouse
of
his
firm
in
this
scheme
planned
with
some
shrewdness
he
with
a
friend
a
at
the
church
of
st
john
the
evangelist
this
friend
was
a
coal
merchant
and
thus
fortunately
circumstanced
in
the
possession
of
wagons
and
horses
these
two
arranged
the
details
of
their
borrowing
expedition
between
them
economically
it
was
a
deal
on
the
lines
of
the
revived
methods
of
exchange
and
barter
gosling
was
willing
to
exchange
certain
advantages
of
knowledge
and
possession
for
the
hire
of
wagons
and
horses
it
was
decided
for
obvious
reasons
to
admit
no
other
conspirator
into
the
plot
and
boost
the
coal
merchant
drove
one
cart
and
gosling
drove
the
other
perhaps
it
should
rather
be
said
that
he
led
the
other
for
after
a
preliminary
trial
he
decided
that
he
was
safer
at
the
horses
heads
than
behind
their
tails
the
raid
was
conducted
with
perfect
success
boost
had
a
head
for
essentials
the
invaluable
loads
of
tinned
meats
fruits
and
vegetables
were
screened
by
tarpaulins
from
the
possibly
too
envious
eyes
of
hungry
quite
a
number
of
vagrants
were
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
on
that
day
and
boost
and
gosling
disguised
in
garments
made
the
return
journey
lugubriously
calling
plague
plague
the
cry
of
the
drivers
of
the
funeral
carts
which
had
even
then
become
necessary
their
only
checks
were
the
various
applications
they
received
for
the
cartage
of
corpses
applications
easily
put
on
one
side
by
pointing
to
the
carts
they
had
spent
six
laborious
hours
in
packing
them
no
room
no
room
they
cried
and
on
that
day
the
applicants
who
accosted
boost
and
gosling
were
not
the
only
ones
who
had
to
wait
for
the
disposal
of
their
dead
gosling
arrived
at
wisteria
grove
hot
and
outwardly
jubilant
albeit
with
a
horrible
fear
lurking
in
his
mind
that
he
had
been
in
dangerous
proximity
to
those
tendered
additions
to
his
load
his
booty
was
stored
in
one
of
the
downstairs
rooms
with
the
assistance
of
mrs
gosling
and
the
two
girls
they
managed
the
unpacking
without
interruption
in
two
hours
and
a
half
and
then
with
boarded
windows
and
locked
doors
the
goslings
sat
down
to
await
the
passing
of
horror
boost
died
of
the
plague
hours
after
the
great
adventure
but
as
he
had
a
wife
and
four
daughters
his
plunder
was
not
wasted
for
nearly
a
fortnight
after
the
raid
the
goslings
lay
snug
in
their
little
house
in
wisteria
grove
for
they
in
company
with
the
majority
of
english
people
at
this
time
had
not
yet
fully
appreciated
the
fact
that
women
were
almost
immune
from
infection
in
all
not
more
than
eight
per
cent
of
the
whole
female
population
was
attacked
and
of
this
proportion
the
mortality
was
almost
exclusively
among
women
over
fifty
years
of
age
when
the
first
faint
rumours
of
the
plague
had
come
to
europe
this
curious
almost
unprecedented
immunity
of
women
had
been
given
considerable
prominence
it
had
made
good
copy
theories
on
the
subject
had
appeared
and
the
point
had
aroused
more
interest
than
that
of
the
mortality
among
males
infectious
diseases
were
commonplace
enough
this
new
phase
had
a
certain
novelty
and
piquancy
but
the
threat
of
european
infection
had
overwhelmed
the
interest
in
the
odd
predilection
of
the
unknown
bacterium
and
the
more
vital
question
had
thrown
this
peculiarity
into
the
background
thus
the
goslings
and
most
other
women
feared
attack
no
less
than
their
husbands
brothers
and
sons
and
found
justification
for
their
fears
in
the
undoubted
fact
that
women
had
died
of
the
plague
the
goslings
had
always
jogged
along
amiably
enough
their
home
life
would
have
passed
muster
as
a
tolerably
happy
one
the
head
of
the
family
was
out
of
the
house
from
to
five
days
of
the
week
and
it
was
only
occasionally
in
the
evening
of
some
long
wet
sunday
that
there
was
any
open
bickering
now
confinement
in
that
little
house
aggravated
by
fear
and
by
the
absence
of
any
interest
or
diversion
coming
from
outside
showed
the
family
to
one
another
in
new
aspects
before
two
days
had
passed
the
air
was
tense
with
the
suppressed
irritation
of
these
four
people
held
together
by
scarcely
any
tie
other
than
that
of
a
conventional
affection
by
the
third
day
the
air
was
so
heavily
charged
that
some
explosion
was
inevitable
it
came
early
in
the
morning
gosling
had
run
out
of
tobacco
and
he
thought
in
the
circumstances
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
send
blanche
or
millie
than
to
go
himself
so
with
an
air
of
exaggerated
carelessness
he
said
look
here
millie
my
gel
i
wish
you
just
run
out
and
see
if
you
can
get
me
any
terbaccer
not
me
replied
millie
with
decision
and
why
not
asked
gosling
millie
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
called
her
sister
who
was
in
the
passage
i
say
father
wants
us
to
go
out
shopping
for
him
are
you
on
blanche
duster
in
hand
appeared
at
the
doorway
why
does
he
go
himself
she
asked
because
replied
her
father
getting
very
red
and
speaking
with
elaborate
care
men
subject
to
the
infection
and
women
is
not
that
all
my
eye
returned
millie
lots
of
women
have
got
it
it
well
known
said
gosling
still
keeping
himself
in
hand
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
women
is
comparatively
immune
oh
that
a
man
yarn
that
is
said
blanche
just
to
save
themselves
we
all
know
what
men
are
selfish
brutes
are
you
going
to
fetch
me
that
terbaccer
or
are
you
not
shouted
mr
gosling
suddenly
no
we
are
said
millie
defiantly
it
is
safe
for
girls
to
go
about
the
streets
let
alone
the
risk
of
infection
she
had
heard
her
father
shout
before
and
she
was
not
as
yet
at
all
intimidated
well
then
i
say
you
are
shouted
her
father
lazy
creatures
the
pair
of
you
paid
for
everything
you
eat
or
drunk
or
wore
ever
since
you
was
born
an
now
you
wo
even
go
an
errand
then
seeing
the
ready
retort
rising
to
his
daughters
lips
he
grew
desperate
and
advancing
a
step
towards
them
he
said
savagely
if
you
do
go
i
find
a
way
to
make
yer
this
was
a
new
aspect
and
the
two
girls
were
a
little
frightened
natural
instinct
prompted
them
to
scream
for
their
mother
she
had
been
listening
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
she
answered
the
call
for
help
with
great
promptitude
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
gosling
she
said
on
a
high
note
the
streets
is
safe
for
gels
as
you
know
well
enough
and
why
should
my
gels
risk
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
your
nasty
dirty
wasteful
of
smoking
i
should
like
to
know
gosling
courage
was
evaporating
at
the
attack
of
this
third
enemy
he
had
been
incensed
against
his
daughters
but
he
had
not
yet
overcome
the
habit
of
giving
in
to
his
wife
for
the
sake
of
peace
she
had
managed
him
very
capably
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
but
on
the
occasions
when
she
had
found
it
necessary
to
use
what
she
called
the
rough
side
of
her
tongue
she
had
demonstrated
very
clearly
which
of
the
two
was
master
i
should
have
thought
i
might
been
allowed
a
little
terbaccer
he
said
resentfully
risked
his
life
to
lay
in
provisions
i
should
like
to
know
an
it
a
matter
o
common
knowledge
as
women
is
immune
from
this
plague
and
mrs
carter
three
doors
off
carried
out
dead
of
it
the
day
before
yesterday
remarked
mrs
gosling
triumphantly
oh
and
there
a
case
or
two
replied
her
husband
but
not
one
woman
to
a
thousand
men
gets
it
as
every
one
knows
and
how
do
you
know
i
might
be
the
one
asked
millie
bold
now
under
her
mother
protection
for
that
morning
the
matter
remained
in
abeyance
but
gosling
muttering
and
grumbling
nursed
his
injury
and
meditated
on
the
fact
that
his
daughters
had
been
afraid
of
him
things
were
altered
now
there
was
no
convention
to
tie
his
hands
he
would
work
himself
into
a
protective
passion
and
defy
the
three
of
them
also
there
was
an
unopened
bottle
of
whisky
in
the
sideboard
nevertheless
he
would
have
put
off
the
trial
of
his
strength
if
he
had
had
to
seek
an
opportunity
he
was
as
yet
too
civilized
to
take
the
initiative
in
cold
blood
the
opportunity
however
soon
presented
itself
in
that
house
the
air
had
been
little
cleared
by
the
morning
outbreak
and
before
evening
the
real
explosion
came
a
mere
trifle
originated
it
a
warning
from
gosling
that
their
store
of
provisions
would
not
last
for
ever
and
a
sharp
retort
from
millie
to
the
effect
that
her
father
did
not
stint
himself
followed
by
a
reminder
from
mrs
gosling
that
the
raid
might
be
repeated
oh
yes
you
be
willing
enough
for
me
to
die
of
the
plague
i
no
doubt
broke
out
gosling
i
can
walk
six
mile
to
get
you
pervisions
but
you
ca
go
to
the
corner
of
the
street
for
my
terbaccer
pervisions
is
necessary
terbaccer
ai
said
mrs
gosling
she
was
not
a
clever
woman
she
judged
this
to
be
the
right
opportunity
to
keep
her
husband
in
his
place
and
relied
implicitly
on
the
quelling
power
of
her
tongue
her
intuitions
were
those
of
the
woman
who
had
lived
all
her
life
in
a
london
suburb
they
did
not
warn
her
that
she
was
now
dealing
with
a
specimen
of
humanity
oh
ai
it
shouted
gosling
getting
to
his
feet
his
face
was
purple
and
his
pale
blue
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
i
soon
show
you
what
necessary
and
what
ai
and
master
in
this
and
i
say
terbaccer
is
necessary
an
what
more
one
you
three
goin
to
fetch

quick
d

o
you
three
this
inclusion
of
mrs
gosling
was
indeed
to
declare
war
millie
and
blanche
screamed
and
backed
but
their
mother
rose
to
the
occasion
she
did
not
reserve
herself
she
began
on
her
top
note
but
gosling
did
not
allow
her
to
finish
he
strode
over
to
her
and
shook
her
by
the
shoulders
shouting
to
drown
her
strident
recriminations
your
tongue
your
tongue
he
bawled
and
shook
her
with
increasing
violence
he
was
feeling
his
power
and
when
his
wife
crumpled
up
and
fell
to
the
floor
in
shrieking
hysterics
he
still
strode
on
to
victory
taking
the
cowed
and
terrified
millie
by
the
arm
he
dragged
her
along
the
passage
unlocked
and
opened
the
front
door
and
pushed
her
out
into
the
street
and
do
you
come
back
without
my
terbaccer
he
shouted
how
much
quavered
the
shrinking
millie
worth
replied
gosling
fiercely
and
tossed
the
coin
down
on
the
little
tiled
walk
that
led
up
to
the
front
door
after
millie
had
gone
he
stood
at
the
door
for
a
moment
thankful
for
the
coolness
of
the
air
on
his
heated
face
i
got
to
keep
this
up
he
murmured
to
himself
with
his
first
thought
of
wavering
behind
him
he
heard
the
sound
of
uncontrolled
weeping
and
little
cries
of
the
first
time
in
years
and
what
the
neighbours
think
i
do
know
neighbours
muttered
gosling
contemptuously
there
are
any
neighbours
not
to
count
a
distant
sound
of
slow
wheels
caught
his
ear
he
listened
attentively
and
there
came
to
him
the
remote
monotonous
chant
of
a
dull
voice
crying
plague
plague
he
stepped
in
quickly
and
closed
the
door
millie
found
the
kilburn
high
road
deserted
no
traffic
of
any
kind
was
to
be
seen
in
the
street
and
the
rare
chiefly
women
had
all
a
furtive
air
starvation
had
driven
them
out
to
raid
no
easy
matter
as
millie
soon
found
for
all
shutters
were
down
and
in
many
cases
were
additionally
protected
by
great
sheets
of
strong
hoarding
millie
recovering
from
her
fright
was
growing
resentful
her
little
conventional
mind
was
greatly
occupied
by
the
fact
that
she
was
out
in
the
high
road
wearing
without
heels
in
an
old
print
dress
and
with
no
hat
to
hide
the
carelessness
of
her
at
the
corner
of
wisteria
grove
she
stopped
and
tried
to
remedy
this
last
defect
she
had
red
hair
abundant
and
difficult
to
control
the
sight
of
the
deserted
high
road
did
not
inspire
her
with
she
still
feared
the
possibility
of
meeting
some
one
who
might
recognize
her
how
could
one
account
for
one
presence
in
a
london
thoroughfare
at
seven
on
a
bright
may
evening
in
such
attire
certainly
not
by
telling
the
truth
the
air
was
wonderfully
clear
coal
was
becoming
very
scarce
and
few
fires
had
been
lighted
that
day
to
belch
forth
their
burden
of
greasy
filth
into
the
atmosphere
the
sun
was
sinking
and
millie
instinctively
clung
to
the
shadow
of
the
pavement
on
the
west
side
of
the
road
she
too
slunk
along
with
the
evasive
air
that
was
common
to
the
few
other
pedestrians
the
majority
of
them
on
this
same
shadowed
pavement
that
warm
radiant
light
on
the
houses
opposite
seemed
to
hold
some
horror
for
them
so
preoccupied
was
millie
with
her
resentment
that
she
wandered
for
two
or
three
hundred
yards
up
the
road
without
any
distinct
idea
of
what
she
was
seeking
when
realization
of
the
futility
of
her
search
came
to
her
she
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
what
is
the
good
of
going
on
she
argued
all
the
shops
are
shut
up
but
the
thought
of
her
father
in
his
new
aspect
of
muscular
tyrant
intimidated
her
she
dared
not
return
without
accomplishing
her
errand
have
another
look
anyway
she
said
and
then
who
have
thought
he
was
such
a
brute
she
rubbed
the
bruise
on
her
arm
her
mouth
was
twisted
into
an
ugly
expression
of
spiteful
resentment
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
plans
of
revenge
even
as
she
turned
to
prosecute
her
search
for
the
tyrant
tobacco
here
and
there
shops
had
been
forcibly
burglariously
entered
windows
smashed
and
interiors
cleared
of
everything
eatable
the
debris
showed
plainly
enough
that
these
rifled
shops
had
all
belonged
to
grocers
or
provision
merchants
into
each
of
these
ruins
millie
stared
curiously
hoping
foolishly
that
she
might
find
what
she
sought
she
ventured
into
one
and
carried
away
a
box
of
soap
they
were
running
short
of
soap
at
home
a
sense
of
moving
among
accessible
riches
stirred
within
her
a
desire
for
further
pillage
she
came
at
last
to
a
shop
where
the
shutters
were
still
intact
but
the
door
hung
drunkenly
on
one
hinge
a
little
fearfully
she
peered
in
and
discovered
that
fortune
had
been
kind
to
her
the
shop
had
belonged
to
a
tobacconist
and
the
contents
were
almost
untouched
there
had
been
more
crying
needs
to
satisfy
in
the
households
of
raiders
than
the
desire
for
tobacco
it
was
very
dark
inside
and
for
some
seconds
millie
stared
into
what
seemed
absolute
blackness
but
as
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
gloom
she
saw
the
interior
begin
to
take
outline
and
when
she
moved
a
couple
of
steps
into
the
place
and
allowed
more
light
to
come
in
through
the
doorway
various
tins
boxes
and
packets
in
the
shelves
behind
the
counter
were
faintly
distinguishable
once
inside
the
spirit
of
plunder
took
hold
of
her
and
she
began
to
take
down
boxes
of
cigars
and
cigarettes
and
packets
of
tobacco
piling
them
up
in
a
heap
on
the
counter
but
she
had
no
basket
in
which
to
carry
the
accumulation
she
was
making
and
she
was
feeling
under
the
counter
for
some
box
into
which
to
put
her
haul
when
the
shadows
round
her
deepened
again
into
almost
absolute
darkness
cautiously
she
peered
up
over
the
counter
and
saw
the
silhouette
of
a
woman
standing
in
the
doorway
for
ten
breathless
seconds
millie
hung
motionless
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
apparition
she
was
very
civilized
still
and
she
was
suddenly
conscious
of
committing
a
crime
she
feared
horribly
lest
the
figure
in
the
doorway
might
discover
millicent
gosling
stealing
tobacco
but
the
intruder
after
recognizing
the
nature
of
the
shop
contents
moved
away
with
a
sigh
millie
heard
her
dragging
footsteps
shuffle
past
the
window
that
scare
decided
her
movements
she
hastily
looped
up
the
front
of
her
skirt
bundled
into
it
as
much
plunder
as
she
could
conveniently
carry
and
made
her
way
out
into
the
street
again
she
was
nearly
at
the
corner
of
wisteria
grove
before
she
was
molested
and
then
an
elderly
woman
came
suddenly
out
of
a
doorway
and
laid
a
hand
on
millie
arm
whacher
got
asked
the
woman
savagely
millie
shrinking
and
terrified
displayed
her
plunder
cigars
muttered
the
woman
whacher
want
with
cigars
she
opened
the
boxes
and
stirred
up
the
contents
of
millie
improvised
bundle
in
an
eager
search
for
something
to
eat
gawd
truth
yer
must
be
crazy
yer
thievin
little
slut
she
grumbled
and
pushed
the
girl
fiercely
from
her
millie
made
good
her
escape
dropping
a
box
of
cigars
in
her
flight
her
one
thought
now
was
the
fear
of
meeting
a
policeman
in
three
minutes
she
was
beating
fiercely
on
the
door
of
the
little
house
in
wisteria
grove
and
disregarding
her
father
exclamations
of
pleased
surprise
when
he
let
her
in
she
tumbled
in
a
heap
on
to
the
mat
in
the
passage
gosling
first
declaration
of
male
superiority
had
been
splendidly
successful
a
few
minutes
after
millie
return
mrs
gosling
and
timidly
vicious
interrupted
her
husband
perfect
enjoyment
of
the
cigar
by
the
announcement
the
gas
is
off
gosling
got
up
struck
a
match
and
held
it
to
the
burner
the
match
burned
steadily
there
was
no
pressure
even
of
air
in
the
pipes
turned
off
at
the
meter
snapped
gosling
lem
me
go
see
he
spoke
with
the
air
of
the
superior
male
strong
in
his
comprehension
of
the
mechanical
artifices
which
so
perplex
the
feminine
mind
mrs
gosling
sniffed
and
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
she
had
already
examined
the
meter
well
we
got
lamps
snarled
gosling
when
he
returned
he
had
always
preferred
a
lamp
to
read
by
in
the
evening
no
oil
returned
mrs
gosling
gloomily
she
teach
him
to
shake
her
gosling
meditated
his
parochial
mind
was
full
of
indignation
vague
thoughts
of
getting
some
one
into
trouble
for
this
even
of
that
last
desperate
act
of
coercion
writing
to
the
papers
about
it
flitted
through
his
mind
plainly
something
must
be
done
you
got
any
candles
he
asked
one
or
two
they
wo
last
long
replied
his
studiously
patient
partner
well
we
to
use
them
and
go
to
bed
early
was
gosling
final
judgment
his
wife
left
the
room
with
a
shrug
of
forbearing
contempt
when
she
had
gone
the
head
of
the
house
went
upstairs
and
peered
out
into
the
street
the
sun
had
set
and
an
unprecedented
mystery
of
darkness
was
falling
over
london
the
globes
of
the
tall
electric
standards
catching
a
last
reflection
from
the
fading
sky
glimmered
faintly
but
were
not
illuminated
from
within
by
any
fierce
glare
of
violet
light
darkness
and
silence
enfolded
the
great
dim
organism
that
sprawled
its
vast
being
over
the
earth
the
spirit
of
mystery
caught
gosling
in
its
spell
all
dark
he
murmured
and
quiet
lord
how
still
it
is
even
in
his
own
house
there
was
silence
downstairs
three
injured
resentful
women
were
talking
in
whispers
gosling
still
sucking
his
cigar
stood
entranced
peering
into
the
darkness
he
had
ventured
so
far
as
to
throw
up
the
sash
it
the
stillness
of
death
he
muttered
then
he
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
for
he
caught
the
sound
of
distant
shouting
somewhere
in
the
kilburn
road
another
raid
was
in
progress
no
light
murmured
gosling
and
no
fire
an
immediate
association
suggested
itself
by
gosh
and
no
water
he
added
for
some
seconds
he
contemplated
with
fearful
awe
the
failure
of
the
great
essential
of
life
in
the
cistern
room
he
was
reassured
by
the
sound
of
a
delicious
trickle
from
the
still
going
he
said
to
himself
but
we
to
be
careful
surely
they
keep
the
water
goin
though
whatever
they
surely
keep
the
water
on
nothing
but
the
failure
of
the
water
could
have
driven
them
from
wisteria
grove
times
every
day
gosling
would
climb
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
reassure
himself
and
at
last
came
the
day
when
a
dreadful
silence
reigned
under
the
slates
when
no
delicious
tinkle
of
water
gave
promise
of
maintained
security
from
water
famine
it
come
on
again
at
night
said
gosling
to
himself
to
be
careful
that
all
he
went
downstairs
and
issued
orders
that
no
more
water
was
to
be
drawn
that
day
well
we
must
wash
up
the
breakfast
things
was
his
wife
reply
you
must
wash
up
nothing
said
gosling
not
one
blessed
thing
it
better
to
go
dirty
than
die
o
thirst
hevery
drop
the
water
in
that
cistern
must
be
saved
for
drinkin
mrs
gosling
noisily
put
down
the
kettle
she
was
holding
oh
very
well
my
lord
she
remarked
sarcastically
she
looked
at
her
two
daughters
with
a
twist
of
her
mouth
there
were
only
two
sides
in
that
house
the
women
were
as
yet
united
against
the
common
foe
when
gosling
fatuously
convinced
of
his
authority
had
gone
his
wife
quietly
filled
the
kettle
and
proceeded
with
her
washing
up
your
father
thinks
knows
everything
these
days
remarked
the
mother
to
her
allies
there
was
much
whispering
for
some
time
gosling
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
roof
but
not
until
the
afternoon
did
he
realize
that
the
cistern
was
slowly
being
emptied
his
first
thought
was
that
one
of
the
pipes
leaked
his
second
that
it
was
time
to
make
a
demonstration
of
force
he
found
a
in
the
hall
but
even
when
that
precious
of
water
was
only
called
upon
to
supply
the
needs
of
thirst
and
the
goslings
sinking
further
into
the
degradation
of
savagedom
slunk
furtive
and
filthy
about
the
gloomy
house
it
became
evident
that
a
move
must
be
made
sooner
or
later
two
alternatives
were
presented
they
might
go
north
and
east
to
the
lea
or
south
to
the
thames
gosling
chose
the
south
he
knew
putney
he
had
been
born
there
he
knew
nothing
of
clapton
and
its
neighbourhood
so
one
bright
clear
day
at
the
end
of
may
the
goslings
set
out
on
their
great
trek
the
head
of
the
house
driven
desperate
by
fear
of
thirst
raided
his
late
partner
coal
sheds
and
found
one
living
horse
and
several
dead
ones
the
living
horse
was
partly
revived
by
water
from
an
adjacent
butt
and
the
next
day
it
was
harnessed
to
a
coal
cart
and
commandeered
to
convey
the
goslings
provisions
to
putney
it
died
short
of
their
destination
but
they
were
able
by
the
exercise
of
their
united
strength
to
get
the
cart
and
its
burden
down
to
the
river
they
found
an
empty
house
without
difficulty
but
they
had
an
unpleasant
in
removing
what
remained
of
one
of
the
previous
occupants
gosling
hoped
it
was
not
a
case
of
plague
as
the
body
was
that
of
a
woman
and
terribly
emaciated
there
were
some
grounds
for
his
optimism
gosling
was
in
a
state
of
some
bewilderment
when
water
had
been
fetched
in
buckets
from
the
river
and
the
three
women
had
explored
criticized
and
sniffed
over
their
new
home
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
strange
cats
the
head
of
the
house
settled
down
to
a
cigar
and
a
careful
consideration
of
his
perplexities
in
the
first
place
he
wondered
why
those
horses
of
boost
had
not
been
used
for
food
in
the
second
he
wondered
why
he
had
not
seen
a
single
man
during
the
whole
of
the
long
trek
from
brondesbury
to
putney
by
degrees
an
unbelievable
explanation
presented
itself
no
men
were
left
he
remembered
that
the
few
women
he
had
seen
had
looked
at
him
curiously
in
retrospect
he
fancied
their
regard
had
had
some
quality
of
amazement
gosling
scratched
the
bristles
of
his
beard
and
smoked
thoughtfully
he
almost
regretted
that
he
had
stared
so
fiercely
and
threateningly
at
every
chance
woman
they
had
seen
he
might
have
got
some
news
but
the
whole
journey
had
been
conducted
in
a
spirit
of
fear
they
had
been
defending
their
food
their
lives
they
had
been
primitive
creatures
ready
to
fight
desperately
at
the
smallest
provocation
no
man
left
said
gosling
to
himself
and
was
not
convinced
if
that
indeed
were
the
solution
of
his
perplexity
he
was
faced
with
an
awful
corollary
his
own
time
would
come
he
thought
of
barbican
of
flack
of
messrs
barker
and
prince
of
the
office
staff
and
the
office
itself
he
had
not
been
able
to
rid
his
mind
of
the
idea
that
in
a
few
weeks
he
would
be
back
in
the
city
again
he
had
several
times
rehearsed
his
surprise
when
he
should
be
told
of
the
depredations
in
the
warehouse
he
had
wondered
only
yesterday
if
he
dared
go
to
the
office
in
his
beard
but
the
change
of
circumstance
the
breaking
up
of
old
associations
was
opening
his
eyes
to
new
horizons
there
might
never
be
an
office
again
for
him
to
go
to
if
he
survived
and
he
was
distinctly
hopeful
on
that
score
he
might
be
almost
the
only
man
left
in
london
there
might
not
be
more
than
a
few
thousand
in
the
whole
of
england
in
europe
for
a
time
he
dwelt
on
this
fantastic
vision
who
would
do
the
work
what
work
would
there
be
to
do
got
to
get
food
murmured
gosling
and
wondered
vaguely
how
food
was
got
when
there
were
no
shops
no
warehouses
no
foreign
agents
his
mind
turned
chiefly
to
meat
since
that
had
been
his
trade
to
rear
sheep
and
cattle
i
suppose
said
gosling
as
an
afterthought
he
added
an
grow
wheat
he
sighed
heavily
he
realized
that
he
had
no
knowledge
on
the
subject
of
rearing
cattle
and
growing
wheat
he
also
realized
that
he
was
craving
for
ordinary
food
again
milk
eggs
and
fresh
vegetables
he
had
a
place
on
his
leg
which
he
rightly
attributed
to
unwholesome
diet
after
hours
residence
in
the
new
house
gosling
began
to
pluck
up
his
courage
and
to
dare
the
perils
of
the
streets
he
was
beginning
to
have
faith
in
his
luck
to
believe
that
the
plague
had
passed
away
and
left
him
untouched
and
as
day
succeeded
day
he
ventured
further
afield
he
went
in
search
of
milk
eggs
and
vegetables
but
he
only
found
young
nettles
which
he
brought
home
and
helped
to
eat
when
they
had
been
boiled
over
a
wood
fire
they
were
all
glad
to
eat
nettles
and
were
the
better
for
them
occasionally
he
met
women
on
these
excursions
and
stayed
to
talk
to
them
always
they
had
the
same
tale
to
tell
their
men
were
dead
and
themselves
dying
of
starvation
one
day
at
the
beginning
of
june
he
went
as
far
as
petersham
and
there
at
the
door
of
a
farmhouse
he
saw
a
fine
tall
young
woman
she
was
such
a
contrast
to
the
women
he
usually
met
on
his
expeditions
that
he
paused
and
regarded
her
with
curiosity
what
do
you
want
asked
the
young
woman
suspiciously
i
suppose
you
any
milk
or
butter
or
eggs
to
sell
asked
gosling
sell
echoed
the
girl
contemptuously
what
you
got
to
give
us
as
is
worth
food
well
money
replied
gosling
money
came
the
echo
again
what
the
good
of
money
when
nothing
to
buy
with
it
i
would
sell
you
eggs
at
a
pound
apiece
gosling
scratched
his
beard
it
looked
quite
like
a
beard
by
this
time
rum
go
ai
it
he
asked
and
smiled
his
new
acquaintance
looked
him
up
and
down
and
then
smiled
in
return
you
right
she
said
you
the
first
man
i
seen
since
father
died
a
month
back
livin
with
you
asked
gosling
pointing
to
the
house
mother
and
sister
that
all
work
for
you
to
get
a
livin
i
suppose
so
so
we
used
to
the
trouble
to
keep
the
other
women
off
ah
replied
gosling
reflectively
and
the
two
looked
at
one
another
again
you
asked
the
girl
not
to
speak
of
replied
gosling
but
i
fair
pinin
for
a
change
o
diet
been
livin
on
tinned
things
for
five
weeks
or
more
come
in
and
have
an
egg
said
the
girl
thank
you
said
gosling
i
will
with
pleasure
they
grew
friendly
over
that
meal
two
eggs
and
a
glass
of
milk
he
ate
the
eggs
with
butter
but
there
was
no
bread
it
seemed
that
the
young
woman
mother
and
sister
were
at
work
on
the
farm
but
that
one
of
them
had
always
to
stay
at
home
and
keep
guard
they
discussed
the
great
change
that
had
come
over
england
and
wondered
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
and
after
a
little
time
gosling
began
to
look
at
the
girl
with
a
new
expression
in
his
pale
blue
eyes
ah
hevrything
changed
he
said
nothin
wo
be
the
same
any
more
as
far
as
we
can
see
there
no
neighbours
now
and
no
talk
of
what
going
on
or
anythin
the
girl
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
what
we
miss
is
some
man
to
look
after
the
place
she
said
we
robbed
terrible
gosling
had
not
meant
to
go
as
far
as
that
he
was
not
unprepared
for
a
pleasant
flirtation
now
that
there
were
no
neighbours
to
report
him
at
home
but
the
idea
that
he
could
ever
separate
himself
permanently
from
his
family
had
not
occurred
to
him
yes
he
said
you
want
a
man
about
these
days
ever
done
any
farm
work
asked
the
girl
gosling
shook
his
head
well
you
soon
learn
she
went
on
i
must
think
it
over
said
gosling
suddenly
shall
you
be
one
of
us
will
said
the
girl
ah
but
shall
you
why
me
well
i
took
a
fancy
to
you
very
kind
of
you
i
sure
said
the
girl
and
laughed
gosling
kissed
her
before
he
left
he
returned
the
next
afternoon
and
helped
to
cut
and
stack
sainfoin
and
afterwards
he
watched
the
young
woman
milk
the
cows
it
was
so
late
by
the
time
everything
was
finished
that
he
was
persuaded
to
stay
the
night
in
the
new
putney
house
three
women
wondered
what
had
happened
to
father
they
grew
increasingly
anxious
for
some
days
and
even
tried
in
a
feeble
way
to
search
for
him
by
the
end
of
the
week
they
accepted
the
theory
that
he
too
had
died
of
the
plague
they
never
saw
him
again
x
exodus
in
west
hampstead
a
jewess
who
had
once
been
fat
looked
out
of
the
windows
of
her
gaudy
house
she
was
partly
dressed
in
a
garish
silk
negligé
her
face
was
exceedingly
dirty
but
the
limp
pallid
flesh
was
revealed
in
those
places
where
she
had
wiped
away
her
abundant
tears
her
body
was
bruised
and
stiff
for
in
a
recent
raid
on
a
house
suspected
of
containing
provisions
she
had
been
hardly
used
by
her
sister
women
she
had
made
the
mistake
of
going
out
too
well
dressed
she
had
imagined
that
expensive
clothes
would
command
respect
as
she
looked
out
she
wept
again
bewailing
her
misery
from
her
earliest
youth
she
had
been
pampered
and
spoilt
she
had
learnt
that
marriage
was
her
sole
object
in
life
and
she
had
sold
herself
at
a
very
respectable
price
she
had
received
the
applause
and
favour
of
her
family
for
marrying
the
man
she
had
chosen
as
most
likely
to
provide
her
with
the
luxury
which
she
regarded
as
her
two
days
ago
she
had
cooked
and
eaten
the
absurdly
expensive
but
diminutive
dog
upon
which
she
had
lavished
the
only
love
of
which
she
had
been
capable
she
had
wept
continuously
as
she
ate
her
idol
but
for
the
first
time
she
had
regretted
his
littleness
hunger
and
thirst
were
driving
her
out
of
the
house
of
which
she
had
been
so
vain
the
primitive
pains
were
awakening
in
her
primitive
instincts
that
had
never
stirred
before
from
her
window
she
could
see
naught
but
endless
streets
of
brick
stone
and
asphalt
but
beyond
that
dry
hot
wilderness
she
knew
there
were
fields
she
had
seen
them
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
when
she
had
motored
to
brighton
fields
had
never
been
associated
in
her
mind
with
food
until
the
strange
new
stirring
of
that
unsuspected
instinct
food
for
her
meant
shops
one
went
to
shops
and
bought
food
and
bought
the
best
at
the
lowest
price
possible
with
all
her
pride
of
position
she
had
never
hesitated
to
haggle
with
shopkeepers
and
when
the
first
pinch
had
come
when
her
husband
had
selfishly
died
of
the
plague
and
her
household
had
deserted
her
it
was
to
the
shops
she
had
gone
autocratically
demanding
her
rights
she
had
learned
by
experience
now
that
she
had
no
longer
any
rights
she
dressed
herself
in
her
clothes
dabbed
her
face
with
powder
to
cover
some
of
the
dirt
there
was
no
water
and
in
any
case
she
did
not
feel
inclined
to
wash
carefully
stowed
away
all
her
money
and
the
best
of
her
jewels
in
a
small
leather
bag
and
set
out
to
find
the
country
where
food
grew
out
of
the
ground
instinct
set
her
face
to
the
north
she
took
the
road
towards
hendon
in
every
quarter
of
london
in
every
great
town
and
city
throughout
europe
women
were
setting
their
faces
towards
the
country
by
the
autumn
london
was
empty
the
fallen
leaves
in
park
squares
and
suburban
streets
were
swept
into
corners
by
the
wind
and
when
the
rain
came
the
leaves
clung
together
and
rotted
and
so
continued
the
long
routine
of
decay
and
birth
when
spring
came
again
nature
returned
with
delicate
strong
hands
to
claim
her
own
for
hundreds
of
years
she
had
been
defied
in
the
heart
of
this
great
hard
stone
place
her
little
tentative
efforts
had
been
rudely
repulsed
no
tender
thread
of
grass
had
been
allowed
to
flourish
for
an
hour
under
the
feet
of
the
crushing
multitude
yet
she
had
fought
with
a
steady
persistence
that
never
relaxed
a
effort
whenever
men
had
given
her
a
moment
opportunity
even
in
the
very
heart
of
that
city
of
burning
struggle
she
had
covered
the
loathed
sterility
with
grass
and
flowers
dandelions
charlock
grounsel
and
other
life
that
men
call
weeds
now
when
her
full
opportunity
came
she
set
to
work
in
her
slow
patient
way
to
wreck
and
cover
the
defilement
of
earth
her
winds
swept
dust
into
every
corner
and
her
rain
turned
it
into
a
shallow
bed
of
soil
ready
to
receive
and
nurture
the
tiny
seeds
that
sailed
on
little
feathered
wings
or
were
carried
by
bird
and
insect
to
some
quiet
refuge
in
which
they
might
renew
life
and
dying
add
fertility
to
the
mother
who
had
brought
them
forth
nature
came
also
with
her
hurricanes
her
lightnings
and
her
frosts
to
rend
and
destroy
she
stripped
slates
from
roofs
thrust
out
gables
and
overturned
solid
walls
she
came
with
fungi
to
undermine
and
with
the
seeds
of
trees
to
split
asunder
she
asked
for
but
a
few
hundred
years
of
patient
continuous
work
in
order
to
make
of
london
once
more
a
garden
where
the
nightingale
might
sing
in
oxford
street
and
the
children
of
a
new
race
pluck
sweet
wild
flowers
over
the
site
of
the
bank
of
england
the
spirit
of
london
had
gone
out
of
her
and
her
body
was
crumbling
and
rotting
there
was
no
life
in
all
that
vast
sprawl
of
bricks
and
mortar
the
very
dogs
and
cats
deserted
by
humanity
left
her
to
seek
their
only
food
to
seek
those
other
living
things
which
were
their
natural
quarry
in
her
prime
london
had
been
the
chief
city
of
the
world
men
and
women
spoke
of
her
as
an
entity
wrote
of
her
as
of
a
personality
loved
her
as
a
friend
this
aggregate
of
streets
and
parks
this
strange
confusion
of
wealth
and
squalor
had
stood
to
men
and
women
for
something
definitely
lovable
it
was
not
her
population
they
loved
not
the
polyglot
crowd
that
swarmed
in
her
streets
but
she
herself
and
all
the
beauty
and
intoxication
of
life
she
had
gathered
into
her
embrace
now
she
was
dead
whatever
fine
qualities
she
had
possessed
whatever
vices
had
gone
from
her
she
sprawled
in
all
her
naked
ugliness
a
huge
corpse
rotting
among
the
hills
awaiting
the
slow
burial
which
nature
was
tediously
preparing
all
those
wonderful
buildings
the
great
emporiums
in
the
west
end
the
magnificent
banks
and
insurance
offices
museums
and
picture
galleries
regarded
as
the
storehouses
of
incalculable
wealth
vast
hotels
palatial
private
residences
the
thundering
railway
termini
government
offices
houses
of
parliament
theatres
churches
and
cathedrals
all
had
become
meaningless
symbols
all
had
represented
some
activity
some
ambition
of
man
and
man
had
fled
to
the
country
for
food
leaving
behind
the
worthless
tokens
of
wealth
that
had
intrigued
him
for
so
many
centuries
gold
and
silver
grew
tarnished
in
huge
safes
that
none
wished
to
rifle
banknotes
became
mildewed
damp
and
fungus
crept
into
the
museums
and
picture
galleries
and
in
the
whole
of
great
britain
there
was
none
to
grieve
every
living
man
and
woman
was
back
at
the
work
of
their
ancestors
praying
once
more
to
ceres
or
demeter
working
with
bent
back
to
produce
the
first
essentials
of
life
each
individual
must
produce
until
such
time
as
there
was
once
more
a
superfluity
until
barns
were
filled
and
wealth
until
the
strong
had
seized
from
the
weak
and
demanded
labour
in
return
for
the
use
of
the
stolen
instrument
until
civilization
had
sprung
anew
from
the
soil
meanwhile
london
was
not
a
city
of
the
dead
but
a
dead

occasional

ideal

for

for
all
the
precious
growths
which
must
ripen
before

could
be
stayed
the
sudden
stoppage
of
all
imports
and
the
flight
of
the
great
urban
population
into
the
country
had
demonstrated
beyond
all
question
the
poverty
of
england
resources
of
food
supply
and
the
demonstration
was
to
prove
of
value
although
there
was
no
economist
left
to
theorize
england
was
once
again
an
independent
unit
and
no
longer

of

england
was
being
subdivided
the
unit
of
organization
was
shrinking
with
amazing
rapidity

for
concentration
grew
with
every
week
that
passed
the
fluidity
of
the
superfluous

was
being
resolved

death
from
starvation
the
women
who
wandered
from
one
farm
to
the
next
died
by
the
way
in
the
putney
house
mrs
gosling
and
her
daughters
were
faced
by
the
failure
of
their
food
supply
the
older
woman
had
little
initiative
she
was
a
true
londoner
her
training
and
all
the
circumstances
of
her
life
had
narrowed
her
imaginative
grasp
till
she
was
only
able
to
comprehend
one
issue
and
as
yet
her
daughters
and
more
particularly
millie
were
so
influenced
by
their
thought
that
they
also
had
shown
little
evidence
of
adaptability
to
the
changed
conditions
we
shall
to
be
careful
was
mrs
gosling
first
expression
of
the
necessity
for
looking
to
the
future
she
had
arranged
the
bulk
of
her
stores
neatly
in
one
room
on
the
second
floor
and
although
a
goodly
array
of
tins
still
faced
her
she
experienced
a
miserly
shrinking
from
any
diminishment
of
their
numbers
moreover
she
had
long
been
without
such
necessities
as
flour
barker
and
prince
had
not
dealt
in
flour
returning
from
her
daily
inspection
one
morning
in
the
second
week
of
july
mrs
gosling
decided
that
something
must
be
done
at
once
fear
of
the
plague
was
almost
dead
but
fear
of
invasion
by
starving
women
had
kept
them
all
close
prisoners
that
house
was
a
fortress
look
gels
said
mrs
gosling
when
she
came
downstairs
somethin
to
be
done
blanche
looked
thoughtful
her
own
mind
had
already
begun
to
work
on
that
great
problem
of
their
future
millie
lazy
and
indifferent
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
replied
all
very
well
mother
but
what
can
we
do
well
i
been
thinking
as
it
very
likely
as
things
ai
so
bad
in
some
places
as
they
are
just
about
said
mrs
gosling
we
got
plenty
o
money
left
and
it
seems
to
me
as
two
of
us
better
go
out
and
a
look
about
london
way
one
of
us
could
look
after
the
easy
enough
now
we
seen
a
soul
about
the
past
fortnight
the
suggestion
brought
a
gleam
of
hope
to
blanche
she
visualized
the
london
she
had
known
it
might
be
that
in
the
heart
of
the
town
business
had
begun
again
that
shops
were
open
and
people
at
work
it
might
be
that
she
could
find
work
there
she
was
longing
for
the
sight
and
movement
of
life
after
these
two
awful
months
of
isolation
i
on
she
said
briskly
me
and
millie
had
better
go
mother
we
can
walk
farther
you
can
lock
up
after
us
and
you
need
open
the
door
to
anyone
are
you
on
mill
we
must
make
ourselves
look
a
bit
more
decent
first
said
millie
glancing
at
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
well
of
course
returned
blanche
we
brought
one
box
of
clothes
with
us
they
spent
some
minutes
in
discussing
the
resources
of
their
wardrobe
come
to
the
worst
we
could
fetch
some
more
things
from
wisteria
i
do
suppose
anyone
has
touched
suggested
blanche
at
the
mention
of
the
house
in
wisteria
grove
mrs
gosling
sighed
noticeably
she
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
place
at
putney
and
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
the
idea
that
there
must
be
accessible
gas
and
water
in
kilburn
as
there
had
always
been
well
you
might
go
up
there
one
day
and
a
look
at
the
place
she
put
in
it
quite
likely
they
got
things
goin
again
up
there
in
less
than
an
hour
blanche
and
millie
had
made
themselves
presentable
life
had
begun
to
stir
again
in
humanity
the
atmosphere
of
horror
which
the
plague
had
brought
was
being
lifted
it
was
as
if
the
dead
germs
had
filled
the
air
with
an
invisible
impalpable
dust
that
had
exercised
a
strange
power
of
depression
the
spirit
of
death
had
hung
over
the
whole
world
and
paralyzed
all
activity
now
the
dust
was
dispersing
the
spirit
was
withdrawing
to
the
unknown
deeps
from
which
it
had
come
it
is
nice
to
feel
decent
again
said
blanche
she
lifted
her
head
and
threw
back
her
shoulders
millie
was
preening
herself
before
the
glass
well
i
sure
you
made
yourselves
look
smart
said
their
mother
with
a
touch
of
pride
they
were
good
girls
she
reflected
if
there
had
been
more
than
a
bit
of
temper
shown
lately
but
then
who
could
have
helped
themselves
it
had
been
a
terrible
time
the
july
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
as
the
two
young
women
presentable
enough
to
attend
morning
service
at
the
church
of
st
john
the
evangelist
kilburn
set
out
to
exhibit
their
charms
and
to
buy
food
in
the
dead
city
they
crossed
putney
bridge
and
made
their
way
towards
hammersmith
the
air
was
miraculously
clear
the
detail
of
the
streets
was
so
sharp
and
bright
that
it
was
as
if
they
saw
with
wonderfully
renewed
and
sensitive
eyes
the
phenomenon
produced
a
sense
of
exhilaration
they
were
conscious
of
quickened
emotion
of
a
sensation
of
physical
is
it
clean
said
blanche
h
funny
returned
millie
like
those
photographs
of
foreign
places
under
their
feet
was
an
accumulation
of
sharp
dry
dust
detritus
of
stone
asphalt
and
steel
in
corners
where
the
fugitive
rubbish
had
found
refuge
from
the
driving
wind
the
dust
had
accumulated
in
flat
mounds
broken
by
scraps
of
paper
or
the
torn
flag
of
some
poster
that
gave
an
untidy
air
of
human
refuse
across
the
open
way
of
certain
roads
the
dust
lay
in
a
waved
pattern
of
nearly
parallel
lines
like
the
ridged
sand
of
the
foreshore
for
some
time
they
kept
to
the
pavements
from
force
of
habit
i
say
mill
do
you
feel
adventurous
asked
blanche
millie
looked
dissatisfied
it
so
lonely
was
her
expression
of
feeling
never
had
london
all
to
myself
before
said
blanche
near
hammersmith
broadway
they
saw
a
tram
standing
on
the
rails
its
thin
tentacle
still
clung
to
the
overhead
wire
that
had
once
given
it
life
as
if
it
waited
there
patiently
hoping
for
a
renewal
of
the
exhilarating
current
almost
unconsciously
blanche
and
millie
quickened
their
pace
perhaps
this
was
the
outermost
dying
ripple
of
life
the
furthest
outpost
of
the
new
activity
that
was
springing
up
in
central
london
but
the
tram
was
guarded
by
something
that
in
the
hot
still
air
seemed
to
surround
it
with
an
almost
visible
mist
eugh
ejaculated
millie
and
shrank
back
do
go
blanche
awful
blanche
hand
also
had
leapt
to
her
face
but
she
took
a
few
steps
forward
and
peered
into
the
sunlit
case
of
steel
and
glass
she
saw
a
heap
of
clothes
about
the
framework
of
a
grotesquely
jointed
scarecrow
and
the
gleam
of
something
round
smooth
and
white
she
screamed
faintly
and
a
filthy
dog
crept
with
a
thin
yelp
from
under
the
seat
and
came
to
the
door
of
the
tram
for
a
moment
it
stood
there
with
an
air
that
was
half
placatory
wrinkling
its
nose
and
feebly
raising
a
stump
of
propitiatory
tail
then
with
another
protesting
yelp
it
crept
back
furtive
and
ashamed
to
its
unlawful
meat
the
two
girls
handkerchief
to
nose
hurried
by
breathless
with
bent
heads
a
little
past
hammersmith
broadway
they
had
their
first
sight
of
human
life
two
gaunt
faces
looked
out
at
them
from
an
upper
window
blanche
waved
her
hand
but
the
women
in
the
house
at
the
strange
sight
of
these
two
fancifully
dressed
girls
shook
their
heads
and
drew
back
doubtless
there
was
some
secret
hoard
of
food
in
that
house
and
the
inmates
feared
the
demands
of
charity
well
we
are
quite
the
last
anyway
commented
blanche
what
were
they
afraid
of
asked
millie
thought
we
wanted
to
cadge
i
expect
suggested
blanche
mean
things
was
her
sister
comment
well
we
were
so
to
have
visitors
blanche
reminded
her
we
did
want
their
beastly
food
complained
the
affronted
millie
the
shops
in
hammersmith
did
not
offer
much
inducement
to
exploration
some
were
still
closely
shuttered
others
presented
goods
that
offered
no
temptation
such
as
hardware
but
the
majority
had
already
been
pillaged
and
devastated
most
of
that
work
had
been
done
in
the
early
days
of
the
plague
when
panic
had
reigned
and
many
men
were
left
to
lead
the
raids
on
the
preserves
of
food
only
one
great
line
of
shuttered
fronts
induced
the
two
girls
to
pause
no
need
to
go
to
wisteria
for
clothes
suggested
blanche
how
could
we
get
in
asked
millie
oh
get
in
some
way
easy
enough
it
stealing
said
millie
and
thought
of
her
raid
on
the
kilburn
tobacconist
you
ca
steal
from
dead
people
explained
blanche
besides
who
have
the
things
if
we
do
i
suppose
it
be
all
right
hesitated
millie
obviously
tempted
well
of
course
returned
blanche
and
paused
i
say
mill
she
burst
out
suddenly
there
all
the
to
choose
from
come
on
for
a
time
they
walked
more
quickly
in
kensington
high
street
they
had
an
adventure
they
saw
a
woman
decked
in
gorgeous
silks
strung
and
studded
with
jewels
from
head
to
foot
she
walked
with
a
slow
and
flaunting
step
gesticulating
and
talking
every
now
and
again
she
would
pause
and
draw
herself
up
with
an
affectation
of
immense
dignity
finger
the
ropes
of
jewels
at
her
breast
and
make
a
slow
gesture
with
her
hands
she
mad
whispered
blanche
and
the
two
girls
terrified
and
trembling
hastily
took
refuge
in
a
great
square
cave
full
of
litter
and
refuse
that
had
once
been
a
grocer
shop
the
woman
passed
their
in
her
stately
progress
westward
without
giving
any
sign
that
she
was
conscious
of
their
presence
when
she
was
nearly
opposite
to
them
she
made
one
of
her
stately
pauses
queen
of
all
the
earth
they
heard
her
say
queen
and
empress
queen
of
the
earth
her
hand
went
up
to
her
head
and
touched
a
strange
collection
of
jewels
pinned
in
her
hair
of
tiaras
and
brooches
that
flashed
brighter
than
the
high
lights
of
the
brilliant
sun
one
carelessly
fastened
brooch
fell
and
she
pushed
it
aside
with
her
foot
you
understand
she
said
in
her
high
wavering
voice
you
understand
queen
and
empress
queen
of
the
earth
they
heard
the
refrain
of
her
gratified
ambition
repeated
as
she
moved
slowly
away
a
long
submerged
memory
rose
to
the
threshold
of
mind
thieving
slut
she
murmured
as
they
came
nearer
to
representative
london
the
signs
of
deserted
traffic
were
more
numerous
by
the
albert
memorial
they
saw
an
overturned
which
had
smashed
into
the
park
railings
and
a
little
further
on
were
two
more
buses
one
standing
decently
at
the
curb
the
other
sprawling
across
the
middle
of
the
road
the
wheels
of
both
were
axle
deep
in
the
dust
which
had
blown
against
them
and
out
of
the
dust
a
few
weak
threads
of
grass
were
sprouting
there
were
other
vehicles
too
cabs
lorries
and
carts
not
a
great
number
altogether
but
even
the
fifty
or
so
which
the
girls
saw
between
kensington
and
knightsbridge
offered
sufficient
testimony
to
the
awful
rapidity
with
which
the
plague
had
spread
for
it
seems
probable
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
drivers
of
these
deserted
vehicles
must
have
been
attacked
by
the
first
agonizing
pains
at
the
base
of
the
skull
while
they
were
actually
employed
in
driving
their
machines
there
were
few
skeletons
to
be
seen
the
lull
which
intervened
between
the
first
unmistakable
symptoms
of
the
plague
and
the
oncoming
of
the
paralysis
had
given
men
time
to
obey
their
instinct
to
die
in
seclusion
the
old
instinct
so
little
altered
by
civilization
those
vestiges
of
humanity
which
remained
had
for
the
most
part
been
cleansed
by
the
processes
of
nature
but
twice
the
girls
disturbed
a
horrible
cloud
of
blue
flies
which
rose
with
an
angry
buzzing
so
loud
that
the
girls
screamed
and
ran
leaving
the
scavengers
to
swoop
eagerly
back
upon
their
carrion
doubtless
the
thing
in
the
hammersmith
tram
had
been
the
body
of
a
woman
from
starvation
even
from
the
houses
there
was
now
little
exhalation
in
knightsbridge
a
little
past
the
top
of
sloane
street
blanche
and
millie
came
to
a
shop
which
diverted
them
from
their
exploration
for
a
time
most
of
the
huge
rolling
shutters
had
been
pulled
down
and
secured
but
one
had
stopped
half
way
and
beyond
the
great
windows
were
uncovered
one
of
ten
million
tragedies
had
descended
swiftly
to
interrupt
the
closing
of
that
immense
place
and
some
combination
of
circumstances
had
followed
to
prevent
the
completion
of
the
work
the
imaginative
might
stop
to
speculate
on
the
mystery
of
that
shutter
the
two
goslings
stopped
to
admire
the
wonders
behind
the
glass
for
a
time
the
desolation
and
silence
of
london
were
forgotten
in
imagination
blanche
and
millie
were
once
again
units
in
the
vast
crowd
of
antagonists
striving
valiantly
to
win
some
prize
in
the
great
competition
between
the
boast
of
wealth
and
the
pathetic
endeavour
of
they
stayed
to
gaze
at
the
creations
behind
the
windows
at
dummies
draped
in
costly
fabrics
such
as
they
had
only
dreamed
of
wearing
the
silks
satins
and
velvets
were
whitened
now
with
the
thin
snow
of
dust
that
had
fallen
upon
them
but
to
blanche
and
millie
they
appeared
still
as
wonders
of
beauty
for
a
minute
or
two
they
criticized
the
models
they
spoke
at
first
in
low
voices
for
the
deep
stillness
of
london
held
them
in
unconscious
awe
but
as
they
became
lost
in
the
fascination
of
their
subject
they
forgot
their
fear
and
then
they
looked
at
one
another
a
little
guiltily
no
harm
in
seeing
if
the
door
locked
anyway
said
blanche
millie
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
no
movement
in
the
frozen
streets
save
the
sweep
of
one
exploring
swallow
even
the
sparrows
had
deserted
the
streets
she
did
not
reply
in
words
but
signified
her
agreement
of
thought
by
a
movement
towards
the
entrance
the
swing
doors
were
not
fastened
and
they
entered
stealthily
they
began
with
the
touch
of
appraising
fingers
wandering
from
room
to
room
but
most
of
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
were
darkened
by
the
drawn
shutters
and
no
glow
of
light
came
in
response
to
the
clicking
of
the
electric
switches
that
they
experimented
with
with
persistent
futility
so
they
adventured
into
the
clearly
lit
rooms
upstairs
and
experienced
a
fallacious
sense
of
security
in
the
knowledge
that
they
were
on
the
floor
above
the
street
fingering
gave
place
to
still
closer
inspection
they
lifted
the
models
from
the
stands
and
shook
them
out
they
held
up
gorgeous
robes
in
front
of
their
own
suburban
dresses
and
admired
each
other
and
themselves
in
the
numerous
cheval
glasses
oh
bother
exclaimed
blanche
at
last
i
going
to
try
on
oh
b
expostulated
the
more
timid
millie
well
why
to
goodness
not
asked
her
elder
sister
who
to
be
any
the
wiser
seems
wrong
somehow
replied
millie
unable
to
shake
off
the
conventions
which
had
so
long
served
her
as
conscience
well
i
am
said
blanche
and
retired
into
a
little
side
room
to
divest
herself
of
her
own
dress
she
had
always
shared
a
bedroom
with
her
sister
and
they
observed
few
modesties
before
each
other
but
blanche
was
mentally
incapable
of
changing
her
dress
in
the
broad
avenues
of
that
extensive
it
is
true
that
the
tall
casement
windows
were
wide
open
and
the
place
was
completely
overlooked
by
the
massive
buildings
opposite
but
even
if
the
windows
had
been
screened
she
would
not
have
changed
her
skirt
in
the
publicity
of
that
open
place
though
every
human
being
in
the
world
were
dead
when
she
emerged
from
her
she
was
transformed
indeed
she
went
over
to
her
still
hesitating
sister
do
me
up
mill
she
said
blanche
had
chosen
well
the
fine
cloth
walking
dress
admirably
fitted
her
young
figure
when
she
had
discarded
her
hat
and
touched
up
her
hair
before
the
glass
only
her
boots
and
her
hands
remained
to
spoil
the
disguise
well
gloved
and
well
shod
she
might
have
passed
down
the
bond
street
of
the
old
london
and
few
women
and
no
man
would
have
known
that
she
had
not
sprung
from
the
ruling
classes
she
posed
she
stepped
back
from
the
mirror
and
fell
to
imitating
the
manners
of
the
revered
aristocracy
she
had
respectfully
studied
from
a
distance
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
joined
by
millie
also
arrayed
in
feathers
and
anxious
to
be
fastened
their
excitement
increased
walking
dresses
gave
place
to
evening
gowns
they
lost
their
sense
of
fear
and
ran
into
other
departments
searching
for
long
white
gloves
to
hide
the
disfigurements
of
household
work
they
paraded
and
bowed
to
each
other
the
climax
came
when
they
discovered
a
court
dress
immensely
trained
and
embroidered
with
gold
thread
laid
by
with
evidences
of
tenderest
care
in
endless
wrappings
of
tissue
paper
surely
the
dress
of
some
elegant
young
duchess
for
a
moment
they
wrangled
but
blanche
triumphed
you
shall
have
it
afterwards
she
said
as
she
ran
to
her
millie
followed
in
an
elaborate
gown
of
indian
silk
a
somewhat
sulky
millie
inclined
to
resent
her
duty
of
lady
maid
she
dragged
disrespectfully
at
the
innumerable
fastenings
my
ejaculated
blanche
when
she
could
indulge
herself
in
the
glory
of
full
examination
before
a
cheval
glass
in
the
open
she
struggled
with
her
train
and
when
she
had
arranged
it
to
her
satisfaction
threw
back
her
shoulders
and
lifted
her
chin
haughtily
i
ought
to
have
some
diamonds
she
reflected
it
drags
round
the
hips
was
millie
criticism
you
should
say
majesty
corrected
blanche
oh
a
queen
are
you
asked
millie
rather
queen
of
all
the
earth
sneered
millie
blanche
face
suddenly
fell
i
wonder
if
she
began
like
this
she
said
and
a
note
of
fear
had
come
into
her
voice
millie
eyes
reflected
her
sister
alarm
oh
let
get
out
of
this
she
said
and
began
to
tear
at
the
neck
of
her
indian
silk
gown
i
wanted
diamonds
too
persisted
blanche
oh
it
is
right
said
millie
i
said
it
was
right
and
you
would
come
silence
descended
upon
them
for
a
moment
and
then
both
sisters
suddenly
screamed
and
ducked
putting
up
their
hands
to
their
heads
goodness
what
was
that
cried
blanche
a
swallow
had
swept
in
through
the
open
window
had
curved
round
in
one
swift
movement
and
shot
out
again
into
the
sunlight
only
a
bird
of
some
sort
said
millie
but
she
was
trembling
and
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
do
let
get
out
b
after
they
had
put
on
their
own
clothes
once
more
they
became
aware
that
they
were
hungry
we
have
wasted
a
lot
of
time
here
said
blanche
as
they
made
their
way
out
she
did
not
pause
to
wonder
how
many
women
had
spent
the
best
part
of
their
lives
in
a
precisely
similar
manner
and
we
ought
to
have
been
looking
for
food
she
added
come
on
replied
millie
that
place
has
given
me
the
creeps
growing
rather
tired
and
footsore
they
made
their
way
to
piccadilly
circus
and
so
on
to
the
strand
everywhere
they
found
the
same
conditions
a
few
skeletons
a
few
deserted
vehicles
young
vegetation
taking
hold
wherever
a
pinch
of
soil
had
found
an
abiding
place
and
over
all
a
great
silence
but
food
there
was
none
that
they
were
able
to
find
though
it
is
probable
that
a
careful
investigation
of
cellars
and
underground
places
might
have
furnished
some
results
the
more
salient
resources
of
london
had
been
effectively
pillaged
so
far
as
the
was
concerned
they
were
too
late
in
trafalgar
square
millie
sat
down
and
cried
blanche
made
no
attempt
to
comfort
her
but
sat
wide
eyed
and
wondering
her
mind
was
opening
to
new
ideas
she
was
beginning
to
understand
that
london
was
incapable
of
supporting
even
the
lives
of
three
women
she
was
wrestling
with
the
problem
of
existence
every
one
had
gone
many
had
died
but
many
more
surely
must
have
fled
into
the
country
she
began
to
understand
that
she
and
her
family
must
also
fly
into
the
country
millie
still
sobbed
convulsively
now
and
again
oh
chuck
it
mill
said
blanche
at
last
we
better
be
getting
home
millie
dabbed
her
eyes
i
starving
she
blubbered
well
so
am
i
returned
blanche
that
why
i
said
we
better
get
home
there
nothing
to
eat
here
is
is
every
one
dead
no
they
gone
off
into
the
country
and
that
what
we
got
to
do
the
younger
girl
sat
up
put
her
hat
straight
and
blew
her
nose
is
it
awful
she
said
blanche
pinched
her
lips
together
what
are
you
putting
your
hat
straight
for
she
asked
there
no
one
to
see
you
well
you
need
make
it
any
worse
retorted
millie
on
the
verge
of
a
fresh
outburst
of
tears
oh
come
on
said
blanche
getting
to
her
feet
i
do
believe
i
can
walk
home
complained
millie
my
feet
ache
so
you
have
to
wait
a
long
time
if
you
going
to
find
a
bus
returned
blanche
three
empty
taxicabs
stood
in
the
rank
a
few
feet
away
from
them
but
it
never
occurred
to
either
of
the
two
young
women
to
attempt
any
experiment
with
these
mechanisms
if
the
thought
had
crossed
their
minds
they
would
have
deemed
it
absurd
let
go
down
by
victoria
suggested
blanche
i
believe
nearer
in
parliament
square
they
disturbed
a
flock
of
rooks
birds
which
had
partly
changed
their
natural
habits
during
the
past
few
months
and
owing
to
the
superabundance
of
one
kind
of
food
were
preying
on
carrion
crows
commented
blanche
beastly
things
i
wonder
if
we
could
get
some
water
to
drink
was
millie
reply
well
there
the
river
suggested
blanche
and
they
turned
up
towards
westminster
bridge
in
one
of
the
tall
buildings
facing
the
river
blanche
attention
was
caught
by
an
open
door
look
here
mill
she
said
we
only
been
looking
for
shops
try
one
of
these
houses
we
might
find
something
to
eat
in
there
i
afraid
said
millie
what
of
sneered
blanche
at
the
worst
it
skeletons
and
we
can
come
out
again
millie
shuddered
you
go
she
suggested
not
by
myself
i
wo
returned
blanche
there
you
are
you
see
said
millie
well
it
different
by
yourself
i
hate
it
returned
millie
with
emphasis
so
do
i
in
a
way
only
i
fair
starving
said
blanche
come
on
the
building
was
solidly
furnished
and
the
ground
floor
although
somewhat
disordered
still
suggested
a
complacent
luxury
on
the
floor
lay
a
copy
of
the
evening
chronicle
dated
may
possibly
one
of
the
last
issues
of
a
london
journal
two
of
the
pages
were
quite
blank
and
almost
the
only
advertisement
was
one
announcement
of
a
patent
medicine
guaranteed
as
a
sure
protection
against
the
plague
the
remainder
of
the
paper
was
filled
with
reports
of
the
devastation
that
was
being
wrought
reports
which
were
nevertheless
marked
by
a
faint
spirit
of
simulated
confidence
between
the
lines
could
be
read
the
story
of
desperate
men
clinging
to
hope
with
splendid
courage
there
were
no
signs
of
panic
here
groves
had
come
out
well
at
the
last
the
two
girls
hovered
over
this
piece
of
ancient
history
for
a
few
minutes
you
see
said
blanche
triumphantly
even
then
two
months
ago
every
one
was
making
for
the
country
we
shall
have
to
go
too
i
told
you
we
should
i
never
said
we
should
returned
millie
anyhow
there
nothing
to
eat
here
not
in
this
room
there
is
said
blanche
but
there
might
be
in
the
kitchens
do
you
know
what
this
place
has
been
millie
shook
her
head
it
been
a
man
club
announced
blanche
first
time
you
been
in
one
old
dear
come
on
let
have
a
look
downstairs
then
returned
millie
careless
of
her
achievement
in
the
first
kitchen
they
found
havoc
broken
china
and
glass
empty
bottles
empty
tins
cooking
utensils
on
the
floor
one
table
upset
everywhere
devastation
and
the
marks
of
struggle
but
in
none
of
the
empty
tins
was
there
the
least
particle
of
food
everything
had
been
completely
cleaned
out
the
rats
had
been
there
and
had
gone
exploring
deeper
however
they
were
at
last
rewarded
on
a
table
stood
a
whole
array
of
unopened
tins
and
in
one
of
them
was
plunged
a
a
single
stab
had
been
given
and
then
possibly
another
of
these
common
tragedies
had
begun
had
he
been
alone
that
plunderer
or
had
his
companions
fled
from
him
in
terror
here
the
two
girls
made
a
sufficient
meal
and
discovered
moreover
a
large
store
of
unopened
they
shared
the
contents
of
one
between
them
and
then
feeling
greatly
reinvigorated
they
sought
for
and
found
two
baskets
which
they
filled
with
tinned
foods
they
only
took
away
one
bottle
of
beer
a
special
treat
for
their
mother
on
account
of
the
weight
they
remembered
that
they
had
a
long
walk
before
them
and
they
were
not
by
their
discovery
they
were
sick
to
death
of
tinned
meats
in
looking
for
the
baskets
they
came
across
a
single
potato
that
the
rats
had
left
from
it
had
sprung
a
long
thin
etiolated
shoot
which
had
crept
under
the
door
of
the
cupboard
and
was
making
its
way
across
the
floor
to
the
light
of
the
window
already
that
shoot
was
several
feet
in
length
funny
how
they
grow
commented
millie
making
for
the
country
i
expect
replied
blanche
same
as
we
shall
have
to
do
it
was
a
relief
to
them
to
find
their
way
into
the
sunlight
once
more
those
cold
forsaken
houses
held
some
suggestion
of
horror
of
old
activities
so
abruptly
ended
by
tragedy
from
these
interiors
nature
was
still
shut
off
that
ghostly
tendril
aching
towards
the
light
had
no
chance
for
life
and
reproduction
the
two
gosling
girls
had
yet
one
more
adventure
before
they
toiled
home
with
their
load
they
were
growing
bolder
despite
the
gloom
and
oppression
of
those
human
habitations
and
some
freakish
spirit
prompted
blanche
to
suggest
that
they
should
visit
the
houses
of
parliament
after
a
brief
demur
millie
acceded
that
great
stronghold
was
open
to
them
now
they
might
walk
the
floor
of
the
house
sit
in
the
speaker
chair
penetrate
into
the
sacred
places
of
the
upper
chamber
gone
were
all
the
rules
and
formulas
the
intricacies
and
precedents
of
an
unwritten
constitution
the
whole
cumbrous
machinery
for
the
making
of
new
laws
the
air
was
no
longer
disturbed
by
the
wranglings
evasions
and
cunning
shifts
of
those
who
had
found
here
a
stage
for
their
personal
ambitions
the
high
talk
of
progress
had
died
into
silence
along
with
the
struggle
of
parties
which
had
played
the
supreme
game
side
against
side
for
the
prize
of
power
progress
had
been
defined
in
this
place
in
terms
of
human
activity
human
comfort
the
end
in
sight
had
been
some
vague
conception
of
general
welfare
through
accumulated
riches
and
from
the
sky
had
fallen
a
pestilence
to
change
the
meaning
of
human
terms
in
three
months
the
old
conception
of
wealth
was
gone
money
precious
stones
a
thousand
accepted
forms
of
value
had
become
suddenly
worthless
of
no
more
account
than
the
symbol
of
power
which
lay
coated
with
dust
on
the
table
of
the
house
of
even
law
itself
that
slow
growth
of
the
centuries
had
become
meaningless
who
cared
if
some
mad
woman
plundered
every
jeweller
shop
in
the
whole
city
who
was
to
forbid
theft
or
avenge
murder
the
place
of
traffic
was
empty
only
one
law
was
left
and
only
one
value
the
law
of
the
value
of
food
the
sunlight
fell
in
broad
coloured
shafts
upon
two
girls
come
on
a
plundering
expedition
and
they
might
sit
in
the
high
places
if
they
would
and
make
new
laws
for
themselves
blanche
sat
for
a
few
moments
in
the
speaker
chair
it
a
fine
big
place
she
remarked
oh
come
on
do
replied
millie
i
want
to
get
home
as
they
crossed
the
square
millie
looked
up
at
big
ben
nine
she
said
it
must
have
stopped
well
of
course
silly
replied
blanche
all
the
clocks
have
stopped
who
to
wind
xii
emigrant
for
some
time
mrs
gosling
was
quite
unable
to
grasp
the
significance
of
her
daughters
report
on
the
condition
of
london
during
the
past
two
months
she
had
persuaded
herself
that
the
traffic
of
the
town
was
being
resumed
and
that
only
putney
was
still
desolate
she
had
always
disapproved
of
putney
it
was
damp
and
she
had
never
known
anyone
who
had
lived
there
it
is
true
that
the
late
lamented
george
gosling
had
been
born
in
putney
but
that
was
more
than
half
a
century
ago
the
place
was
no
doubt
quite
different
then
and
he
had
left
putney
and
gone
to
live
in
the
healthy
north
before
he
was
sixteen
mrs
gosling
was
half
inclined
to
blame
putney
for
all
their
misfortunes
it
was
sure
to
breed
infection
being
so
near
the
river
and
all
and
she
had
become
hopeful
during
the
past
month
that
all
would
be
well
with
them
if
they
could
once
get
back
to
kilburn
mean
to
say
you
did
see
no
one
at
all
she
repeated
in
great
perplexity
those
three
we
told
you
about
that
all
said
blanche
well
o
course
they
all
shut
up
in
the
still
afraid
o
the
plague
and
on
to
what
provisions
they
got
put
by
same
as
us
was
the
hopeful
explanation
mrs
gosling
put
forward
they
ai
said
millie
and
blanche
agreed
well
but
know
persisted
the
mother
did
you
go
in
to
the
one
or
two
returned
blanche
evasively
but
there
was
no
need
to
go
in
you
could
see
are
you
quite
sure
there
was
no
shops
open
not
in
the
strand
mrs
gosling
laid
emphasis
on
the
last
sentence
she
could
not
doubt
the
good
faith
of
the
strand
if
that
failed
her
all
was
lost
oh
ca
you
understand
mother
broke
out
blanche
petulantly
that
the
whole
of
london
is
absolutely
deserted
there
is
a
soul
in
the
streets
there
no
cabs
or
buses
or
trams
or
anything
and
grass
growing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
all
the
shops
have
been
broken
into
all
those
that
had
food
in
and
words
failed
her
is
it
millie
she
concluded
lamely
awful
agreed
millie
well
i
ca
understand
it
said
mrs
gosling
not
yet
fully
convinced
she
considered
earnestly
for
a
few
moments
and
then
asked
did
you
go
into
charing
cross
post
office
they
sure
to
be
open
yes
lied
blanche
and
we
could
have
taken
all
the
money
in
the
place
if
we
wanted
and
no
one
any
the
wiser
mrs
gosling
looked
shocked
i
my
gels
never
come
to
that
she
said
her
girls
with
a
wonderful
understanding
of
their
opinions
had
omitted
to
mention
their
raid
on
the
knightsbridge
emporium
no
one
ever
know
said
millie
there
one
who
would
replied
mrs
gosling
gravely
and
strangely
enough
perhaps
the
two
girls
looked
uneasy
but
they
were
thinking
less
of
the
commandments
miraculously
given
to
moses
than
of
the
probable
displeasure
of
the
vicar
of
st
john
the
evangelist
church
in
kilburn
well
we
got
to
do
something
anyhow
said
blanche
after
a
pause
i
mean
we
have
to
get
out
of
this
and
go
into
the
country
we
might
go
to
your
uncle
in
liverpool
suggested
mrs
gosling
tentatively
it
a
long
walk
remarked
blanche
mrs
gosling
did
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
this
objection
well
i
think
we
could
afford
she
said
besides
though
we
corresponded
much
of
late
years
i
always
been
under
the
impression
that
your
uncle
is
doin
well
in
liverpool
and
at
such
a
time
as
this
i
sure
do
the
right
thing
though
whether
it
would
be
better
to
let
know
we
comin
or
not
i
not
quite
sure
oh
dear
sighed
blanche
i
do
wish
you
try
to
understand
mother
there
are
any
trains
there
are
any
posts
or
telegraphs
wherever
we
go
we
just
got
to
walk
have
we
millie
millie
began
to
snivel
it
she
said
well
i
ca
understand
it
repeated
mrs
gosling
by
degrees
however
the
controversy
took
a
new
shape
granting
for
the
moment
the
main
contention
that
london
was
uninhabitated
mrs
gosling
urged
that
it
would
be
a
dangerous
even
a
foolhardy
thing
to
venture
into
the
country
if
there
was
no
government
there
would
be
no
law
and
order
was
the
substance
of
her
argument
government
in
her
mind
being
represented
by
its
concrete
presentation
in
the
form
of
the
utterly
reliable
policeman
furthermore
she
pointed
out
that
they
did
not
know
anyone
in
the
country
with
the
exception
of
a
uncle
in
liverpool
and
that
there
would
be
nowhere
for
them
to
go
we
shall
have
to
work
said
blanche
who
was
surely
inspired
by
her
glimpse
of
the
silent
city
well
we
got
nearly
a
pounds
left
of
what
your
poor
father
drew
out
o
the
bank
before
we
shut
ourselves
up
said
her
mother
i
suppose
we
could
buy
things
in
the
country
speculated
blanche
you
seem
set
on
the
country
for
some
reason
said
mrs
gosling
with
a
touch
of
temper
well
we
got
to
get
food
returned
blanche
raising
her
voice
we
ca
live
on
air
and
if
food
to
be
got
cheaper
in
the
country
than
in
london
snapped
mrs
gosling
my
experience
goes
for
nothing
but
of
course
you
know
best
if
i
am
your
mother
there
is
any
food
in
london
cheap
or
dear
i
keep
telling
you
said
blanche
and
left
the
room
angrily
slamming
the
door
behind
her
millie
sat
moodily
biting
her
nails
blanche
lets
temper
get
the
better
of
remarked
mrs
gosling
addressing
the
spaces
of
the
kitchen
in
which
they
were
sitting
it
right
worse
luck
said
millie
we
shall
have
to
go
i
it
nearly
as
much
as
you
do
the
argument
thus
begun
was
continued
with
few
intermissions
for
a
whole
week
a
thunderstorm
followed
by
two
days
of
overcast
weather
came
to
the
support
of
the
older
woman
one
thing
was
certain
among
all
these
terrible
perplexities
namely
that
you
could
start
off
for
a
trip
to
the
country
on
a
wet
day
meanwhile
their
stores
continued
to
diminish
and
one
afternoon
mrs
gosling
consented
to
take
a
walk
with
blanche
as
far
as
hammersmith
broadway
the
sight
of
that
blank
desert
impressed
her
blanche
pointed
out
the
house
in
which
she
had
seen
the
two
women
five
days
before
but
no
one
was
looking
out
of
the
window
on
that
afternoon
perhaps
they
had
fled
to
the
country
or
were
occupied
elsewhere
in
the
house
or
perhaps
they
had
left
london
by
the
easier
way
which
had
become
so
general
in
the
past
few
months
when
she
returned
to
the
putney
house
mrs
gosling
wept
and
wished
she
too
was
dead
but
she
consented
at
last
to
blanche
continually
urged
proposition
in
so
far
as
she
expressed
herself
willing
to
make
a
move
of
some
sort
she
thought
they
might
at
least
go
back
and
have
a
look
at
wisteria
grove
and
if
kilburn
had
indeed
fallen
as
low
as
hammersmith
then
there
was
apparently
no
help
for
it
and
they
must
try
their
luck
in
the
waste
and
desolation
of
the
country
perhaps
some
farmer
wife
might
take
them
in
for
a
time
until
they
had
a
chance
to
look
about
them
they
had
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
in
gold
the
girls
found
a
builder
trolley
in
a
yard
near
by
a
truck
of
sturdy
build
on
two
wheels
with
a
long
handle
it
bore
marks
of
having
held
cement
and
there
were
weeds
growing
in
one
end
of
it
but
after
it
had
been
brought
home
and
thoroughly
scrubbed
it
looked
quite
a
presentable
means
for
the
transport
of
the
necessaries
they
proposed
to
take
with
them
they
made
too
generous
an
estimate
of
essentials
at
first
piling
their
truck
too
high
for
safety
and
overtaxing
their
strength
but
that
problem
like
many
others
was
finally
solved
for
them
by
the
guidance
of
necessity
they
started
one
morning
a
monday
if
their
calculations
were
not
at
fault
about
two
hours
after
breakfast
mrs
gosling
and
millie
pushed
behind
and
blanche
the
inspired
one
went
before
pulled
by
the
handle
of
the
pole
and
gave
the
others
their
direction
it
is
possible
that
they
were
the
last
women
to
leave
london
by
chance
they
discovered
the
queen
of
all
the
earth
on
a
doorstep
near
addison
road
she
was
quite
dead
but
they
did
not
despoil
her
of
the
jewels
with
which
she
was
still
covered
mrs
gosling
was
a
source
of
trouble
from
the
outset
she
had
lived
her
life
indoors
in
the
wisteria
grove
days
she
never
spent
two
hours
of
the
out
of
the
house
some
times
for
a
whole
week
she
had
not
gone
out
at
all
it
was
a
mark
of
their
rise
in
the
world
that
all
the
tradesmen
called
for
orders
she
had
found
little
necessity
to
buy
in
shops
during
recent
years
and
so
very
surely
she
had
grown
more
and
more
limited
in
her
outlook
her
attention
had
become
concentrated
on
the
duties
of
the
housewife
she
had
not
kept
any
servant
a
charwoman
who
came
for
a
few
hours
three
times
a
week
had
done
all
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
not
dared
in
face
of
neighbourly
criticism
in
her
position
she
could
not
be
seen
washing
down
the
little
tiled
path
to
the
gate
nor
whitening
the
steps
the
effect
of
this
cramped
existence
on
mrs
gosling
would
not
have
been
noticeable
under
the
old
conditions
she
had
become
a
specialized
creature
admirably
adapted
to
her
place
in
the
old
scheme
of
civilization
no
demand
was
ever
made
upon
her
resources
other
than
those
familiar
demands
which
she
was
so
perfectly
educated
to
supply
even
when
the
plague
had
come
she
had
not
been
compelled
to
alter
her
mode
of
life
she
had
made
trouble
enough
about
the
lack
of
many
things
she
had
once
believed
to
be
necessary
familiar
foods
soap
and
the
thousand
little
conveniences
that
the
twentieth
century
inventor
had
patented
to
assist
the
domestic
economy
of
the
small
householder
but
the
trouble
was
not
too
great
to
be
overcome
the
adaptability
required
from
her
was
within
the
scope
of
her
specialized
vision
she
could
learn
to
do
without
flour
butter
lard
milk
sugar
and
the
other
things
but
she
could
not
learn
to
think
on
unfamiliar
lines
that
was
the
essence
of
her
trouble
she
was
divorced
from
a
permanent
home
she
was
asked
to
walk
long
miles
in
the
open
air
worst
of
all
she
was
called
upon
for
initiative
ingenuity
she
was
required
to
exercise
her
imagination
in
order
to
solve
a
problem
with
which
she
was
quite
unfamiliar
she
was
expected
to
develop
the
potentialities
of
the
wild
thing
and
to
extort
food
from
nature
the
whole
problem
was
beyond
her
comprehension
the
sight
of
kilburn
was
a
great
blow
to
her
she
had
hoped
against
hope
that
here
at
least
she
would
find
some
semblance
of
the
life
she
had
known
it
had
seemed
so
impossible
to
her
that
aiken
the
butcher
or
hobb
the
grocer
would
not
be
open
as
usual
and
the
vision
of
those
two
desolated
and
ransacked
shops
the
latter
with
but
a
few
murderous
spears
of
left
in
its
once
magnificent
windows
depressed
her
to
tears
so
shaken
was
she
by
the
sight
of
these
horrors
that
blanche
and
millie
raised
no
objection
to
sleeping
that
night
in
the
house
in
wisteria
grove
indeed
the
two
girls
were
almost
tired
out
although
it
was
yet
early
in
the
afternoon
the
truck
had
become
very
heavy
in
the
course
of
the
last
two
miles
and
they
had
had
considerable
difficulty
in
negotiating
the
hill
by
westbourne
park
station
mrs
gosling
was
still
weeping
as
she
let
herself
in
to
her
old
home
and
she
wept
as
she
prowled
about
the
familiar
rooms
and
noted
the
dust
which
had
fallen
like
snow
on
every
surface
which
would
support
it
and
for
the
first
time
the
loss
of
her
husband
came
home
to
her
she
had
been
almost
glad
when
he
had
vanished
from
the
putney
house
in
that
place
she
had
only
seen
him
in
his
new
character
of
tyrant
here
among
familiar
associations
she
recalled
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
respectable
complacent
successful
man
who
had
never
given
her
cause
for
trouble
a
man
who
did
not
drink
nor
run
after
other
women
who
held
a
position
in
the
church
and
was
looked
up
to
by
the
neighbourhood
according
to
her
definition
he
had
certainly
been
an
ideal
husband
it
is
true
that
they
had
dropped
any
pretence
of
being
in
love
with
one
another
after
blanche
was
born
but
that
was
only
natural
mrs
gosling
sat
on
the
bed
she
had
shared
with
him
so
long
and
hoped
he
was
happy
he
was
but
if
she
could
have
seen
the
nature
of
his
happiness
the
sight
would
have
given
her
no
comfort
vaguely
she
pictured
him
in
some
strange
paradise
built
upon
those
conceptions
of
the
mediæval
artists
mainly
italians
which
have
supplied
the
ideals
of
the
orthodox
she
saw
an
imperfectly
transfigured
and
still
fleshly
george
gosling
who
did
unaccustomed
things
with
a
harp
was
dressed
in
exotic
garments
and
was
on
terms
with
certain
hybrids
largely
woman
but
partly
bird
who
were
clearly
recognizable
as
the
angelic
host
if
she
had
been
a
mohammedan
her
vision
would
have
accorded
far
more
nearly
with
the
fact
the
successful
animal
is
that
which
is
adapted
to
its
circumstances
herbert
spencer
would
appear
foolish
and
incapable
in
the
society
of
the
young
wits
who
frequent
the
private
bar
he
might
be
described
by
them
as
an
old
johnny
who
knew
nothing
about
life
mrs
gosling
in
her
own
home
had
been
a
ruler
she
had
had
authority
over
her
daughters
and
despite
the
usual
evidences
of
girlish
precocity
she
had
always
been
mistress
of
the
situation
in
the
affairs
of
household
management
she
was
facile
princeps
and
she
commanded
the
respect
accorded
to
the
eminent
in
any
form
of
specialized
activity
but
even
on
this
second
morning
of
their
emigration
it
became
clear
to
blanche
that
her
mother
had
ceased
to
rule
and
must
become
a
subordinate
a
certain
respect
was
due
to
her
in
her
parental
relation
but
if
she
could
not
be
coaxed
she
must
be
coerced
she
be
better
when
we
get
her
right
away
from
here
was
diagnosis
and
millie
who
had
also
achieved
some
partial
realization
of
the
necessities
imposed
by
the
new
conditions
nodded
in
agreement
she
wants
to
stop
here
altogether
and
of
course
we
ca
she
said
we
shall
starve
if
we
do
said
blanche
from
that
time
mrs
gosling
dropped
into
the
humiliating
position
of
a
kind
of
mental
incapable
who
must
be
humoured
into
obedience
the
first
and
in
many
ways
the
most
difficult
task
was
to
persuade
her
away
from
kilburn
she
clung
desperately
to
that
stronghold
of
her
old
life
i
too
old
to
change
at
my
age
she
protested
and
when
the
alternative
was
clearly
put
before
her
she
accepted
it
with
a
flaccidity
that
was
as
aggravating
as
it
was
unfightable
i
sooner
die
said
mrs
gosling
than
go
trapesing
about
the
fields
lookin
for
somethin
to
eat
i
simply
could
do
it
different
for
you
two
gels
no
doubt
you
go
and
leave
me
millie
might
have
been
tempted
to
take
her
mother
at
her
word
but
blanche
never
for
a
moment
entertained
the
idea
of
leaving
her
mother
behind
very
well
mother
she
said
desperately
if
you
wo
come
we
must
all
stop
here
and
starve
i
suppose
we
got
enough
food
to
last
a
fortnight
or
so
as
she
spoke
she
looked
out
of
the
window
of
that
little
suburban
house
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
thought
came
to
her
of
the
strangeness
of
preferring
such
an
inconvenient
little
box
to
the
adventure
of
the
wider
spaces
of
open
country
outside
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
but
the
windows
were
dim
with
dust
and
cobwebs
yet
her
mother
was
comparatively
happy
in
this
hovel
she
would
find
delight
in
cleaning
it
although
there
was
no
one
to
appraise
the
result
of
her
effort
she
was
a
specialized
animal
with
habits
precisely
analogous
to
the
instincts
of
other
animals
and
insects
there
were
insects
who
could
only
live
in
filth
and
would
die
miserably
if
removed
from
their
natural
surroundings
mrs
gosling
was
a
insect
who
would
perish
in
the
open
air
after
all
the
chief
difference
between
insects
and
men
is
that
the
insect
is
born
perfectly
adapted
to
its
specialized
existence
man
finds
or
is
forced
into
a
place
in
the
scheme
after
he
has
come
to
maturity
i
ca
see
why
you
should
leave
me
behind
pleaded
mrs
gosling
well
we
wo
replied
blanche
still
looking
out
of
the
window
it
wicked
of
you
to
make
us
stop
here
and
starve
put
in
millie
and
even
you
must
see
that
we
shall
starve
mrs
gosling
wept
feebly
she
had
wept
much
during
the
past
hours
where
can
we
go
she
wailed
there
country
on
the
other
side
of
harrow
said
blanche
the
thought
of
harrow
or
timbuctoo
was
equally
repugnant
to
mrs
gosling
then
millie
had
an
idea
well
we
only
brought
four
bottles
of
water
with
us
she
said
where
are
we
going
to
get
any
more
in
kilburn
mrs
gosling
racked
her
brain
in
the
effort
to
remember
some
convenient
stream
in
the
neighbourhood
it
may
rain
she
said
feebly
at
last
blanche
turned
from
the
window
and
pointed
to
the
blurred
prospect
of
sunlit
street
we
might
be
dead
before
the
rain
came
she
said
they
wore
her
out
in
the
end
with
harrow
as
an
immediate
objective
they
toiled
up
willesden
lane
with
their
early
the
next
morning
blanche
took
that
route
because
it
was
familiar
to
her
and
after
passing
willesden
green
she
followed
the
tram
lines
as
they
got
away
from
london
they
came
upon
evidences
of
the
exodus
which
had
preceded
them
bodies
of
women
for
the
most
part
no
longer
malodorous
were
not
infrequent
and
pieces
of
household
furniture
parcels
of
clothing
boxes
trunks
and
smaller
impedimenta
lay
by
the
roadside
the
superfluities
of
earlier
loads
that
had
been
lightened
however
reluctantly
mrs
gosling
blenched
at
the
sight
of
every
body
only
a
few
of
them
could
be
described
as
skeletons
and
protested
that
they
were
all
going
to
their
death
but
blanche
kept
on
resolutely
with
a
white
set
face
and
as
millie
followed
her
example
if
with
rather
less
show
of
temerity
there
was
no
choice
but
to
follow
when
the
gradients
were
favourable
the
girls
helped
their
mother
on
to
the
truck
and
gave
her
a
lift
she
was
a
feeble
walker
not
till
they
reached
sudbury
did
they
see
another
living
being
of
their
own
species
or
any
sign
of
human
habitation
in
the
long
rows
of
dirty
houses
the
great
surge
of
migration
had
spread
out
from
the
centre
and
become
absorbed
in
circles
of
amplitude
the
great
entity
of
london
had
eaten
its
way
so
far
outwards
in
to
arable
and
pasturage
that
within
a
radius
from
charing
cross
not
a
thousand
women
could
be
found
who
had
been
able
to
obtain
any
promise
of
security
from
the
products
of
the
soil
and
although
there
were
great
open
spaces
of
land
such
as
wembley
park
which
had
to
be
crossed
in
the
journey
outwards
the
exiles
had
been
unable
to
wait
until
such
time
as
seed
could
be
transformed
into
food
by
the
alchemy
of
nature
so
the
pressure
had
been
continually
outwards
forcing
the
emigrants
toward
the
more
distant
farms
where
some
fraction
of
them
at
least
might
find
work
and
food
until
the
coming
of
the
harvest
in
kent
vegetables
were
comparatively
plentiful
in
northern
middlesex
and
buckinghamshire
the
majority
had
to
depend
upon
animal
food
but
in
all
the
home
counties
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
every
large
town
famine
was
following
hard
upon
the
heels
of
the
plague
and
per
cent
of
the
women
and
children
who
had
escaped
the
latter
visitation
died
of
starvation
and
exposure
before
the
middle
of
august
in
the
first
inner
ring
still
sparsely
populated
were
to
be
found
those
who
had
had
vegetable
gardens
and
had
been
vigorous
enough
to
protect
themselves
against
the
flood
of
migration
which
had
swept
up
against
them
it
was
the
first
signs
of
this
inner
ring
that
the
goslings
discovered
at
sudbury
they
came
upon
a
little
row
of
cottages
standing
back
a
few
yards
from
the
road
all
three
women
had
been
engaged
in
pushing
their
trolly
up
an
ascent
and
with
heads
down
and
all
their
physical
energies
concentrated
upon
their
task
they
did
not
notice
the
startling
difference
between
these
cottages
and
other
houses
they
had
passed
until
they
stopped
to
take
breath
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
mrs
gosling
had
immediately
seated
herself
upon
the
sloping
pole
of
the
trolly
handle
she
was
breathing
heavily
and
had
her
hands
pressed
to
her
sides
millie
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
trolly
her
eyes
still
on
the
ground
but
blanche
had
thrown
back
her
shoulders
and
opened
her
lungs
and
she
saw
the
banner
of
smoke
that
flew
from
the
middle
of
the
three
smoke
in
this
wilderness
smoke
the
sign
of
human
life
to
blanche
it
seemed
the
fulfilment
of
a
great
hope
she
had
begun
to
wonder
if
all
the
world
were
dead
oh
she
gasped
look
they
looked
without
eagerness
anticipating
some
familiar
horror
ooh
echoed
millie
when
she
too
had
recognized
the
harbinger
but
mrs
gosling
did
not
raise
her
eyes
high
enough
what
she
asked
stupidly
there
some
one
living
in
that
cottage
said
blanche
and
pointed
upwards
to
the
soaring
pennant
mrs
gosling
face
brightened
well
to
be
sure
she
said
i
wonder
if
they
let
me
sit
down
and
rest
for
a
few
minutes
and
perhaps
they
might
be
willing
to
sell
me
a
glass
of
milk
i
sure
i
pay
a
good
price
for
it
we
can
see
anyway
replied
millie
and
they
roused
themselves
and
pushed
on
eagerly
the
cottage
was
not
more
than
thirty
yards
away
before
they
reached
it
a
woman
came
to
the
doorway
stared
at
them
for
a
moment
and
then
came
down
to
the
little
wooden
gate
she
was
a
woman
of
fifty
or
so
with
iron
grey
hair
cut
close
to
her
head
she
wore
a
tweed
skirt
which
did
not
reach
the
tops
of
her
heavily
soled
high
boots
she
looked
capable
energetic
and
muscular
and
in
her
hand
she
carried
about
three
feet
of
stout
broomstick
she
did
not
speak
until
the
little
procession
halted
before
her
gate
and
then
she
pointed
meaningly
up
the
road
with
her
broomstick
and
said
go
on
you
ca
stop
here
she
spoke
with
the
voice
and
inflection
of
an
educated
woman
blanche
paused
in
the
act
of
setting
down
the
trolly
handle
mrs
gosling
and
millie
stared
in
amazement
they
had
been
prepared
to
weep
on
the
neck
of
this
human
friend
found
at
last
in
the
awful
desert
of
middlesex
we
only
wanted
to
buy
a
little
milk
stammered
blanche
no
less
astonished
than
her
mother
and
sister
the
big
woman
looked
them
over
with
something
of
pity
and
contempt
i
can
see
you
not
dangerous
she
sneered
and
crossed
her
great
bare
over
the
top
of
the
gate
only
three
poor
feckless
idiots
going
begging
we
not
begging
retorted
blanche
we
got
money
and
willing
to
pay
money
repeated
the
woman
she
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
nodded
her
head
as
though
beseeching
pity
for
these
feeble
creatures
my
dear
girl
she
went
on
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
good
of
money
in
this
world
you
ca
eat
money
nor
wear
it
nor
use
it
to
light
a
fire
now
if
you
offered
me
a
box
of
matches
you
should
have
had
all
the
milk
i
can
spare
well
i
never
put
in
mrs
gosling
who
had
feebly
come
to
rest
again
on
the
handle
of
the
trolly
no
my
good
woman
you
never
did
said
the
stranger
you
never
could
and
i
should
say
the
chances
are
that
you
never
will
millie
was
intimidated
and
shrinking
even
blanche
looked
a
little
nervous
but
mrs
gosling
was
incapable
of
feeling
fear
of
a
you
ca
mean
as
you
wo
sell
us
a
glass
of
milk
she
said
have
you
got
a
box
of
matches
you
exchange
for
it
asked
the
stranger
i
got
a
burning
glass
i
stole
in
harrow
but
you
depend
on
the
sun
no
nor
the
last
three
weeks
said
mrs
gosling
but
if
you
more
money
than
you
know
what
to
do
with
i
should
thought
as
you
been
willing
to
spare
a
glass
o
milk
for
charity
sake
the
stranger
regarded
her
petitioner
with
a
hard
smile
sake
she
said
do
you
realize
that
i
had
to
defend
this
place
like
a
fort
against
thousands
of
your
sort
i
killed
three
madwomen
who
fought
me
for
possession
and
buried
in
the
orchard
like
cats
i
held
out
through
the
first
rush
and
i
can
hold
out
now
easily
enough
you
three
are
the
first
i
seen
for
a
month
and
before
that
they
begun
to
get
weak
and
poor
these
are
your
daughters
i
suppose
and
the
three
of
you
had
always
depended
upon
some
fool
of
a
man
to
keep
you
yes
well
you
deserve
all
you
got
now
you
can
start
and
do
a
little
healthy
useful
work
for
yourselves
no
pity
for
you
i
got
a
damned
fool
of
a
sister
and
an
old
fool
of
a
mother
to
keep
in
there
she
pointed
to
the
cottage
with
her
broomstick
parasitic
like
you
both
of
and
pretty
well
all
the
use
they
are
is
to
keep
the
fire
alight
no
my
good
woman
you
get
no
charity
from
me
when
she
had
finished
her
speech
which
she
delivered
with
a
fluency
and
point
that
suggested
familiarity
with
the
platform
the
stranger
crossed
her
arms
again
over
the
gate
and
stared
mrs
gosling
out
of
countenance
come
along
my
dears
said
that
outraged
lady
getting
wearily
to
her
feet
i
would
wish
your
ears
soiled
by
such
language
from
a
woman
as
forgotten
the
manners
of
a
lady
but
there
poor
thing
i
no
doubt
been
turned
with
all
this
trouble
the
stranger
smiled
grimly
and
made
no
reply
but
as
the
goslings
were
moving
away
she
called
out
to
them
suddenly
hi
you
a
witless
creature
along
the
road
who
probably
help
you
the
house
is
up
a
side
road
bear
round
to
the
right
what
a
beast
muttered
blanche
when
they
had
gone
on
a
few
yards
one
o
them
women
my
dear
panted
mrs
gosling
who
remembered
the
beginning
of
the
movement
and
still
clung
to
the
old
terminology
unsexed
creatures
i
remember
how
your
poor
father
used
to
i
like
to
get
even
with
her
said
millie
they
bore
to
the
right
and
so
avoided
two
turnings
which
led
up
hills
but
they
missed
the
side
road
i
sure
we
must
have
passed
it
complained
mrs
gosling
at
last
her
sighs
had
been
increasing
in
volume
and
poignancy
for
the
past
and
the
prospect
of
uninhabited
country
which
lay
immediately
around
her
she
found
infinitely
dispiriting
there
is
an
in
sight
she
added
and
i
really
believe
i
can
walk
much
farther
blanche
stopped
and
looked
over
the
fields
on
her
right
towards
london
in
the
distance
blurred
by
an
oily
wriggle
of
heat
haze
she
could
see
the
last
wave
of
suburban
villas
which
had
broken
upon
this
shore
of
open
country
they
had
left
the
town
behind
them
at
last
but
they
had
not
found
what
they
sought
this
little
arm
of
land
which
cut
off
harrow
and
wealdstone
from
the
mother
lake
of
london
had
not
offered
sufficient
temptation
to
delay
their
forerunners
in
the
search
for
food
most
of
them
with
a
true
instinct
for
what
they
sought
had
followed
the
main
road
into
the
chiltern
hills
and
those
who
for
some
cause
or
another
had
wandered
into
this
side
track
had
pushed
on
even
as
blanche
and
millie
would
have
done
had
they
not
been
dragged
back
by
their
mother
complaints
the
sun
was
falling
a
little
towards
the
west
and
bird
and
animal
life
which
had
seemed
to
rest
during
the
intenser
heat
of
was
stirring
and
calling
all
about
them
a
rabbit
lolloped
into
the
road
a
few
yards
away
pricked
up
its
ears
stared
for
an
instant
and
then
scuttled
to
cover
a
blackbird
flew
out
of
the
hedge
and
fled
chattering
up
the
ditch
the
air
was
murmurous
with
the
hum
of
innumerable
insects
and
above
mrs
gosling
head
hovered
a
group
of
flies
which
ever
and
again
bobbed
down
as
if
following
some
concerted
plan
of
action
and
tried
to
settle
on
the
poor
woman
heated
face
oh
get
away
do
she
panted
and
flapped
a
futile
handkerchief
how
quiet
it
is
said
blanche
and
although
the
air
was
full
of
sound
it
did
indeed
appear
that
a
great
hush
had
fallen
over
the
earth
no
threateningly
bellowed
its
automatic
demand
for
right
of
way
there
was
no
echo
of
hoofs
nor
grind
of
wheels
no
call
of
children
voices
nor
even
the
bark
of
a
dog
the
wild
things
had
the
place
to
themselves
again
and
the
sound
of
their
movements
called
for
no
response
from
civilized
minds
the
ears
of
the
goslings
heard
but
did
not
note
these
to
them
useless
evidences
of
life
they
were
straining
and
alert
for
the
voice
of
humanity
i
do
know
when
i
felt
the
so
much
said
mrs
gosling
suddenly
and
blanche
and
millie
both
started
hush
said
blanche
and
held
up
a
warning
finger
in
the
distance
they
heard
a
sound
like
the
closing
of
a
gate
and
then
very
clear
and
small
a
feminine
voice
chuck
chuck
chuck
it
said
chuck
chuck
chuck
i
told
you
we
passed
it
said
mrs
gosling
triumphantly
they
turned
the
trolly
and
began
to
retrace
their
footsteps
their
eager
eyes
tried
to
peer
through
the
spinney
of
trees
which
shut
them
off
from
the
south
once
or
twice
they
stopped
to
listen
the
voice
was
fainter
now
but
they
could
hear
the
squawk
of
greedily
competitive
fowls
xiii
differences
the
only
side
road
they
could
find
proved
to
be
no
more
than
a
track
through
the
little
wood
they
almost
passed
it
a
second
time
and
hesitated
at
the
gate
a
sturdy
gate
bearing
private
on
a
conspicuous
label
debating
whether
this
could
be
right
they
still
suffered
a
spasm
of
fear
at
the
thought
of
trespass
and
to
open
this
gate
and
march
up
an
unknown
private
road
pushing
a
seemed
to
them
an
act
of
terrible
aggression
we
might
leave
the
cart
just
inside
suggested
blanche
and
get
our
food
stole
said
mrs
gosling
there
no
one
about
urged
blanche
there
that
broomstick
woman
said
millie
she
may
have
followed
us
i
sure
i
dunno
if
it
safe
to
go
foragin
in
among
them
trees
neither
continued
mrs
gosling
are
you
sure
this
is
right
blanche
well
of
course
i
not
sure
replied
blanche
with
a
touch
of
temper
they
peered
through
the
trees
and
listened
but
no
sign
of
a
house
was
to
be
seen
and
all
was
now
silent
save
for
the
long
drone
of
innumerable
bees
about
their
afternoon
business
oh
come
on
said
blanche
at
last
she
was
rapidly
learning
to
solve
all
their
problems
by
this
simple
formula
in
the
wood
they
found
refuge
from
those
attendant
flies
which
had
hung
over
them
so
persistently
mrs
gosling
gave
a
final
flick
with
her
handkerchief
and
declared
her
relief
it
quite
pleasant
in
she
said
after
the
the
two
girls
also
seemed
to
find
new
vigour
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
we
have
got
a
cheek
said
millie
with
a
giggle
well
needs
must
when
the
devil
drives
returned
mrs
gosling
and
our
circumstances
is
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
besides
which
there
ca
be
any
in
offerin
to
buy
a
glass
of
milk
blanche
tugged
at
the
trolley
handle
with
a
flicker
of
impatience
why
would
her
mother
be
so
foolish
surely
she
must
see
that
everything
was
different
now
blanche
was
beginning
to
wonder
at
and
admire
the
marvel
of
her
own
intelligence
how
much
cleverer
she
was
than
the
others
how
much
more
ready
to
appreciate
and
adapt
herself
to
change
they
could
not
understand
this
new
state
of
things
but
she
could
and
she
prided
herself
on
her
powers
of
discrimination
everything
different
now
she
said
to
herself
we
can
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
almost
it
like
as
if
we
were
all
starting
off
level
again
in
a
way
she
felt
uplifted
she
took
extraordinary
pleasure
in
her
own
realization
of
facts
a
strange
new
power
had
come
to
her
a
power
to
enjoy
life
through
mastery
different
now
she
repeated
she
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
pity
for
her
mother
and
sister
the
road
through
the
wood
curved
sharply
round
to
the
right
and
they
came
suddenly
upon
a
clearing
and
saw
the
house
in
front
of
them
it
was
a
long
low
house
smothered
in
roses
and
creepers
and
it
stood
in
a
wild
garden
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
red
brick
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
several
cows
were
lying
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
reflectively
chewing
the
cud
with
slow
deliberate
enjoyment
while
one
solitary
stood
with
its
head
over
the
garden
gate
motionless
save
for
an
occasional
petulant
whisp
of
its
ropey
tail
now
then
what
are
we
going
to
do
asked
mrs
gosling
the
procession
halted
and
the
three
women
regarded
the
guardian
cow
with
every
sign
of
dismay
shoo
said
millie
feebly
flapping
her
hands
and
blanche
repeated
the
intimidation
with
greater
force
but
the
cow
merely
acknowledged
the
salutation
by
an
irritable
sweep
of
its
tail
brute
muttered
mrs
gosling
and
flicked
her
handkerchief
in
the
direction
of
the
brute
quarters
i
know
said
blanche
conceiving
a
subtle
strategy
we
drive
it
away
with
the
cart
she
turned
the
trolly
round
and
the
three
of
them
grasping
the
pole
they
advanced
slowly
and
warily
to
the
charge
pushing
their
siege
ram
before
them
they
made
a
slight
detour
to
achieve
a
flank
attack
and
allow
the
enemy
a
clear
way
of
retreat
oh
dear
what
are
you
doing
said
a
voice
suddenly
and
the
three
startled
goslings
nearly
dropped
the
pole
in
their
alarm
they
had
been
so
utterly
absorbed
in
their
campaign
a
young
woman
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
very
brown
hot
and
dishevelled
was
regarding
them
from
the
other
side
of
the
garden
wall
with
a
stare
of
amazement
that
even
as
they
turned
was
flickering
into
laughter
it
that
great
brute
by
the
gate
my
dear
said
mrs
gosling
and
we
just
you
do
mean
alice
interrupted
the
young
woman
oh
you
go
charging
poor
dear
alice
with
a
great
cart
like
that
three
of
you
too
is
its
name
alice
asked
blanche
stupidly
she
did
not
feel
equal
to
this
curious
occasion
its
name
replied
the
young
woman
with
scorn
her
name
alice
if
that
what
you
mean
she
shook
back
the
hair
from
her
eyes
and
moved
down
to
the
gate
the
cow
acknowledged
her
presence
by
an
indolent
toss
of
the
head
oh
but
my
sweet
alice
protested
the
young
woman
you
must
move
and
let
these
funny
people
come
in
it
really
is
good
for
you
dear
to
stand
about
in
the
sun
like
this
and
you
much
better
go
and
lie
down
in
the
shade
for
a
bit
she
gently
pulled
the
gate
from
under
the
cow
chin
and
then
laying
her
hands
flat
on
its
side
made
as
if
to
push
it
out
of
the
way
well
i
never
declared
mrs
gosling
regarding
the
performance
with
much
the
same
awe
as
she
might
have
vouchsafed
to
a
in
a
circus
thought
it
been
that
tame
the
cow
after
a
moment
resistance
moved
off
with
a
leisurely
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
wood
now
you
funny
people
what
do
you
want
asked
the
young
woman
mrs
gosling
began
to
explain
but
blanche
quickly
interposed
oh
do
be
quiet
mother
you
do
understand
she
said
and
continued
before
her
mother
could
remonstrate
we
come
from
london
goodness
commented
the
young
woman
and
we
want
blanche
hesitated
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
in
the
light
of
her
wonderful
discovery
it
was
not
so
easy
to
define
precisely
what
they
ought
to
want
as
the
broomstick
woman
had
said
they
were
beggars
fairly
confronted
with
the
problem
blanche
saw
no
alternative
but
a
candid
acknowledgment
of
the
fact
you
want
feeding
of
course
put
in
the
young
woman
they
all
do
you
need
think
you
the
first
we
had
dozens
a
solution
presented
itself
to
blanche
we
do
really
want
food
she
said
we
got
a
lot
of
tinned
things
left
still
only
we
ill
with
eating
tinned
things
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
be
willing
to
let
us
have
some
milk
and
eggs
and
vegetables
in
exchange
that
sensible
enough
commented
the
young
woman
if
you
only
knew
the
things
we
have
been
offered
money
chiefly
of
course
mrs
gosling
opened
her
mouth
but
blanche
frowned
and
shook
her
head
and
it
does
seem
as
if
money
about
as
useless
as
buttons
in
fact
sooner
have
buttons
you
can
use
them
but
the
other
funny
things
bits
of
old
furniture
jewellery
you
should
have
heard
mrs
isaacson
she
was
a
jewess
who
came
from
hampstead
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
she
had
a
lot
of
jewels
she
kept
in
a
bag
tied
round
her
waist
under
her
skirt
and
when
aunt
may
and
i
simply
had
to
tell
her
to
go
she
tried
to
bribe
us
with
an
old
brooch
and
rubbish
she
was
a
terror
but
i
say
she
looked
at
the
sun
i
got
lots
of
things
to
do
before
sunset
she
paused
and
looked
at
the
three
goslings
look
here
she
went
on
are
you
all
right
you
seem
all
right
again
mrs
gosling
began
to
reply
but
blanche
was
too
quick
for
her
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
right
she
asked
raising
her
voice
to
drown
her
mother
well
i
never
did
such
well
of
course
mother
give
you
any
mortal
thing
you
want
replied
the
young
woman
at
the
gate
dear
old
mater
she
simply
wo
think
of
what
we
going
to
do
in
the
winter
and
i
mean
if
you
come
in
for
say
and
we
let
you
have
a
few
odd
things
you
wo
go
and
plant
yourselves
on
us
like
that
mrs
isaacson
and
one
or
two
others
because
if
you
do
aunt
may
and
i
will
have
to
turn
you
out
you
know
what
we
we
pay
for
said
mrs
gosling
with
dignity
the
young
woman
smiled
oh
i
dare
say
she
said
pay
us
with
those
pretty
little
yellow
counters
that
are
the
least
good
to
anyone
you
wait
here
half
a
jiff
i
find
aunt
may
she
ran
up
the
path
and
entered
the
house
a
moment
later
they
heard
her
calling
aunt
may
auntie
somewhere
out
at
the
back
let
aunt
may
more
common
sense
remarked
mrs
gosling
blanche
turned
on
her
almost
fiercely
for
goodness
sake
mother
she
said
do
try
and
get
it
out
of
your
head
if
you
can
that
we
can
buy
things
with
money
ca
you
see
that
everything
different
you
see
that
money
no
good
that
you
ca
eat
it
or
wear
it
or
light
a
fire
with
it
like
that
other
woman
said
ca
you
understand
or
wo
you
mrs
gosling
gaped
in
amazement
it
was
incredible
that
the
mind
of
blanche
should
also
have
been
distorted
by
this
terrible
heresy
she
turned
in
sympathy
to
millie
who
had
taken
her
mother
seat
on
the
pole
of
the
trolly
but
millie
frowned
and
said
b
right
you
ca
buy
things
with
money
not
here
anyway
they
do
with
money
if
they
got
it
mrs
gosling
looked
at
the
trees
at
the
cows
lying
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
at
the
sunlit
fields
beyond
the
house
but
she
saw
nothing
which
suggested
an
immediate
use
for
gold
coin
lem
me
sit
down
my
dear
she
said
what
with
the
and
all
this
walkin
oh
what
would
i
give
for
a
cup
o
tea
millie
got
up
sulkily
and
leaned
against
the
wall
i
suppose
let
us
stop
here
she
asked
if
we
do
make
fools
of
ourselves
replied
blanche
spitefully
mrs
gosling
drooped
no
inspiration
had
come
to
her
as
it
had
come
to
her
daughter
the
older
woman
had
become
too
specialized
she
swayed
her
head
searching
like
some
great
larva
dug
up
from
its
refuse
heap
confused
and
feeble
in
this
new
strange
place
of
light
and
air
and
as
blanche
had
repeated
to
herself
everything
different
so
mrs
gosling
seized
a
phrase
and
clung
to
it
as
to
some
explanation
of
this
horrible
perplexity
i
ca
understand
it
she
said
i
ca
understand
it
aunt
may
appeared
after
a
long
interval
a
thin
woman
of
forty
or
so
she
wore
a
very
short
skirt
a
man
jacket
and
an
old
deerstalker
hat
and
she
carried
a
pitchfork
she
must
have
brought
the
pitchfork
as
an
emblem
of
authority
but
she
did
not
handle
it
as
the
other
woman
had
handled
her
broomstick
the
murderous
pitchfork
appeared
little
more
deadly
in
her
keeping
than
does
the
mace
in
the
house
of
commons
but
as
an
emblem
the
pitchfork
was
infinitely
more
effective
aunt
may
questions
were
pertinent
and
searching
and
after
a
few
brief
explanations
had
been
offered
to
her
she
drove
off
the
young
woman
her
niece
whom
she
addressed
as
allie
to
perform
the
many
duties
which
were
her
share
of
the
day
work
allie
went
laughing
you
can
sleep
here
announced
aunt
may
we
shall
have
a
meal
all
together
soon
after
sunset
till
then
you
can
talk
to
my
sister
who
an
invalid
she
always
eager
for
news
she
took
charge
of
them
as
if
she
were
the
matron
of
a
workhouse
receiving
new
inmates
you
better
bring
your
truck
into
the
garden
she
said
or
alice
will
be
turning
everything
over
inquisitive
brute
she
added
snapping
her
fingers
at
the
cow
who
had
returned
and
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
them
eyeing
the
goslings
with
a
slow
dull
wonder
a
mournfully
sleepy
beast
whose
furiously
wakeful
tail
seemed
anxious
to
rouse
its
owner
out
of
her
torpor
the
invalid
sister
sat
by
the
window
of
a
small
room
that
faced
west
and
overlooked
the
luxuriance
of
what
was
still
recognizably
a
my
sister
mrs
pollard
said
aunt
may
sharply
and
then
addressing
the
woman
who
sat
huddled
in
shawls
by
the
window
she
added
three
more
strays
fanny
from
london
allie
tells
me
she
went
out
quickly
closing
the
door
with
a
vigour
which
indicated
little
tolerance
for
invalid
nerves
mrs
pollard
stretched
out
a
delicate
white
hand
please
come
and
sit
near
me
she
said
and
tell
me
about
london
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
had
any
news
from
there
perhaps
you
might
be
able
she
broke
off
and
looked
at
the
three
strangers
with
a
certain
pathetic
eagerness
i
take
me
bonnet
off
if
you
excuse
me
remarked
mrs
gosling
she
felt
at
home
once
more
within
the
delightful
shelter
of
a
house
although
slightly
overawed
by
the
aspect
of
the
room
and
its
occupant
about
both
there
was
an
air
of
that
class
dignity
to
which
mrs
gosling
knew
she
could
never
attain
i
do
know
when
i
felt
the
as
i
she
remarked
politely
has
it
been
hot
asked
mrs
pollard
to
me
the
days
all
seem
so
much
alike
i
want
you
to
tell
me
were
there
any
young
men
in
london
when
you
left
you
have
seen
any
young
man
who
at
all
resembles
this
photograph
have
you
mrs
gosling
stared
at
the
photograph
which
mrs
pollard
took
from
the
table
at
her
side
stared
and
shook
her
head
we
have
seen
a
single
man
of
any
kind
for
two
months
said
blanche
not
a
single
one
have
we
millie
millie
sitting
rather
stiffly
on
her
chair
shook
her
head
terrible
she
said
i
sure
i
do
know
where
they
can
have
all
gone
to
mrs
pollard
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
she
looked
steadfastly
out
of
the
window
and
tears
which
she
made
no
attempt
to
restrain
chased
each
other
in
little
jerks
down
her
smooth
pale
cheeks
mrs
gosling
pinched
her
mouth
into
an
expression
of
suffering
sympathy
and
shook
her
head
at
her
daughters
to
enforce
silence
was
she
not
also
a
widow
after
a
short
pause
mrs
pollard
fumbled
in
her
lap
and
discovered
a
a
reminiscence
doubtless
of
some
earlier
bereavement
her
expression
had
been
in
no
way
distorted
as
she
wept
and
after
the
tears
had
been
wiped
away
no
trace
of
them
disfigured
her
delicate
face
her
voice
was
still
calm
and
sweet
as
she
said
i
am
very
foolish
to
go
on
hoping
i
loved
too
much
and
this
trial
has
been
sent
to
teach
me
that
all
love
but
one
is
vain
that
i
must
not
set
my
heart
upon
things
of
the
earth
and
yet
i
go
on
hoping
that
my
poor
boy
was
not
cut
off
in
sin
dear
dear
murmured
mrs
gosling
you
mus
take
it
to
too
much
boys
will
be
a
little
wild
and
no
doubt
our
father
will
make
excuses
mrs
pollard
shook
her
head
if
it
had
only
been
a
little
wildness
she
said
i
should
have
hope
he
is
indeed
just
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
but
my
poor
alfred
became
tainted
with
the
terrible
doctrines
of
rome
it
has
been
the
greatest
grief
of
my
life
and
i
have
known
much
pain
and
again
the
tears
slowly
welled
up
and
fell
silently
down
that
smooth
unchanging
face
mrs
gosling
sniffed
sympathetically
the
two
girls
glanced
at
one
another
with
slightly
raised
eyebrows
and
blanche
almost
invisibly
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
warm
evening
light
threw
the
figure
of
the
woman
in
the
window
into
high
relief
her
look
of
ecstatic
resignation
was
that
of
some
wonderful
mediæval
saint
returned
from
the
age
of
vision
and
miracle
to
a
recently
purified
earth
in
which
the
old
ideas
of
saintship
had
again
become
possible
her
influence
was
upon
the
room
in
which
she
sat
the
sounds
of
the
world
outside
the
evening
chorus
of
wild
life
the
familiar
noise
of
the
farm
seemed
to
blend
into
a
remote
music
of
prayer
kyrie
eleison
christe
eleison
within
was
a
great
stillness
as
of
a
thin
and
bloodless
purity
the
long
continuance
of
a
single
thought
found
some
echo
in
every
material
object
while
the
silence
lasted
everything
in
that
room
was
responsive
to
this
single
keynote
of
anæmic
virtue
mrs
gosling
tried
desperately
to
weep
without
noise
and
even
the
two
girls
falling
under
the
spell
ceased
to
glance
covertly
at
one
another
with
that
hint
of
criticism
but
sat
subdued
and
weakened
as
if
some
element
of
life
had
been
taken
from
them
the
lips
of
the
woman
in
the
window
moved
noiselessly
her
hands
were
clasped
in
her
lap
she
was
praying
firm
and
somewhat
clumsy
steps
were
heard
in
the
passage
the
door
was
pushed
roughly
open
banging
back
against
the
black
oak
chair
which
was
set
behind
it
and
aunt
may
entered
carrying
a
large
tray
here
your
dinner
fanny
she
said
we
done
earlier
in
spite
of
interruptions
she
bustled
over
to
the
little
table
in
the
window
pushed
back
the
bible
and
photograph
with
the
edge
of
the
tray
until
she
could
release
one
hand
and
then
having
driven
the
tray
into
a
position
of
safety
moved
bible
and
photograph
to
the
centre
table
there
was
something
protestingly
vigorous
about
her
movements
as
though
she
endeavoured
to
combat
by
noise
and
energy
the
impoverished
vitality
of
that
emasculate
room
now
you
three
she
went
on
you
had
better
come
out
into
the
kitchen
and
take
your
things
off
and
as
the
goslings
rose
mrs
pollard
turned
to
them
and
stretched
out
to
each
in
turn
her
delicate
white
hand
there
is
only
one
comforter
she
said
put
your
trust
in
him
mrs
gosling
gulped
and
blanche
and
millie
looked
as
they
used
to
look
when
they
attended
the
held
by
the
vicar
wife
blanche
gave
a
shiver
of
relief
as
they
came
out
into
the
passage
her
mind
was
suddenly
filled
by
the
astounding
thought
that
everything
was
not
different
supper
was
laid
on
the
kitchen
table
cold
chicken
potatoes
and
cabbage
stewed
plums
and
cream
and
warm
new
milk
in
a
jug
no
bread
no
salt
and
no
pepper
as
the
three
goslings
washed
at
the
scullery
sink
they
chattered
freely
they
felt
pleasure
at
release
from
some
cold
draining
influence
they
felt
as
if
they
had
come
out
of
church
after
some
long
dull
service
into
the
air
and
sunlight
i
sure
she
a
very
lady
was
mrs
gosling
final
summary
blanche
shivered
again
oh
freezing
was
her
enigmatic
reply
millie
said
it
gave
her
the
creeps
they
were
a
party
of
seven
at
supper
the
meal
was
referred
to
as
supper
although
to
mrs
pollard
it
had
been
dignified
by
the
name
of
dinner
including
two
young
women
whom
the
goslings
had
not
hitherto
seen
strong
girls
who
spoke
with
a
country
accent
they
had
something
still
of
the
manner
of
servants
but
they
were
treated
as
equals
both
by
allie
and
aunt
may
there
was
little
conversation
during
the
meal
however
for
all
of
them
were
too
intent
on
the
business
in
hand
to
the
goslings
that
meal
was
indeed
a
banquet
when
they
had
all
finished
aunt
may
rose
at
once
thank
heaven
for
daylight
she
remarked
but
we
must
set
our
brains
to
work
to
invent
some
light
for
the
winter
we
have
a
candle
or
a
drop
of
oil
left
she
went
on
addressing
the
goslings
and
for
the
past
five
weeks
we
have
had
to
bustle
to
get
everything
done
before
sunset
i
can
tell
you
last
night
we
could
wash
up
after
supper
we
know
replied
blanche
aunt
may
nodded
we
all
know
she
said
now
you
three
girls
get
busy
and
allie
and
the
two
young
women
rose
a
little
wearily
i
getting
an
old
woman
remarked
aunt
may
and
i
allowed
certain
privileges
chief
of
them
that
i
do
work
after
supper
she
paused
and
looked
keenly
at
the
three
goslings
which
of
you
three
is
in
command
she
asked
well
it
seems
as
if
my
eldest
blanche
that
is
sort
o
taken
the
lead
the
past
few
days
began
mrs
gosling
ah
i
thought
so
said
aunt
may
well
now
blanche
you
better
come
out
into
the
garden
and
have
a
talk
with
me
and
we
decide
what
you
had
better
do
if
your
mother
and
sister
would
like
to
go
to
bed
allie
will
show
them
where
they
can
sleep
she
moved
away
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
and
blanche
followed
her
chapter
xiv
xiv
aunt
may
the
sun
had
set
but
as
yet
the
daylight
was
scarcely
faded
under
the
trees
the
fowls
muttered
in
subdued
cluckings
and
occasionally
one
of
them
would
flutter
up
into
the
lower
branches
with
a
squawk
of
effort
and
then
settle
herself
with
a
great
fluttering
and
swelling
of
feathers
and
all
the
suggestion
of
a
fussy
matron
preparing
for
the
night
preparing
only
for
these
early
roosters
sat
and
watchful
as
if
they
knew
that
there
was
no
chance
of
sleep
for
them
until
every
member
of
that
careless
crowd
below
had
found
its
appointed
place
in
the
dormitory
we
put
inside
in
the
winter
remarked
aunt
may
as
she
and
blanche
paused
but
they
prefer
the
trees
we
have
any
foxes
here
but
i
noticed
that
the
wild
things
seem
to
be
coming
back
blanche
nodded
she
was
thinking
how
much
there
was
to
learn
concerning
those
matters
which
appertained
to
the
production
of
food
they
rather
a
poor
lot
aunt
may
continued
but
they
have
to
forage
for
themselves
except
for
the
few
bits
of
vegetable
and
such
things
we
can
spare
them
we
no
corn
or
flour
or
meal
of
any
kind
for
ourselves
yet
but
a
farmer
wife
about
a
mile
from
here
has
got
a
few
acres
of
wheat
and
barley
coming
on
and
we
shall
help
her
to
harvest
and
take
our
share
later
we
shall
be
rich
then
she
added
with
a
smile
i
you
know
said
blanche
we
got
an
awful
lot
to
learn
millie
and
me
you
learn
quickly
enough
was
the
answer
you
have
to
i
suppose
returned
blanche
at
the
end
of
the
orchard
through
which
they
had
been
passing
they
came
to
a
knoll
crowned
by
a
great
elm
round
the
trunk
of
the
elm
a
rough
seat
had
been
fixed
and
here
aunt
may
sat
down
with
a
sigh
of
relief
it
a
blessed
thing
to
earn
your
own
bread
day
by
day
she
said
it
a
beautiful
thing
to
live
near
the
earth
and
feel
physically
tired
at
night
it
delightful
to
be
primitive
and
agricultural
and
i
love
it
but
i
have
a
civilized
vice
blanche
i
have
a
store
of
cigarettes
i
stole
from
a
shop
in
harrow
and
every
night
when
it
fine
i
come
out
here
after
supper
and
smoke
three
and
when
it
wet
i
smoke
in
my
own
bedroom
and
i
dream
but
i
going
to
talk
to
you
because
you
want
help
she
produced
a
cigarette
case
and
matches
from
a
side
pocket
of
her
jacket
lit
a
cigarette
inhaled
the
smoke
with
a
long
gasp
of
intensest
enjoyment
and
then
said
men
were
fools
my
dear
they
had
pockets
in
their
coats
yes
said
blanche
she
felt
puzzled
and
a
little
awkward
she
knew
that
this
woman
was
a
friend
but
the
girl
objective
mind
was
critical
and
embarrassed
do
you
smoke
asked
aunt
may
i
can
spare
you
a
cigarette
though
i
know
the
time
must
come
when
there
wo
be
any
more
still
a
long
way
off
yet
bless
the
clever
man
who
invented
tins
no
i
do
smoke
thanks
replied
blanche
conventionally
and
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
keep
some
hint
of
stiffness
out
of
her
voice
modern
manners
take
a
long
time
to
influence
suburban
homes
of
the
wisteria
grove
type
ah
well
you
miss
a
lot
said
aunt
may
but
you
better
without
it
especially
now
when
tobacco
is
easy
to
get
and
will
soon
be
impossible
but
do
you
think
asked
blanche
drawing
her
eyebrows
together
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
going
on
always
i
dare
say
do
ask
me
my
dear
the
problem
beyond
me
what
we
poor
women
have
got
to
do
is
to
keep
ourselves
alive
in
the
meantime
and
that
what
we
come
out
here
to
talk
about
what
about
your
mother
and
you
two
girls
where
are
you
going
and
what
are
you
proposing
to
do
i
do
know
said
blanche
i
i
been
trying
to
think
good
remarked
aunt
may
i
believe
you
do
i
doubtful
about
your
sister
we
have
to
work
on
a
farm
i
suppose
it
the
only
way
to
live
only
where
that
what
i
been
trying
to
worry
out
said
aunt
may
we
do
get
news
here
of
a
sort
our
girls
work
in
mrs
jordan
fields
and
meet
girls
and
women
who
come
from
pinner
and
the
pinner
people
hear
news
from
northwood
and
the
northwood
people
from
somewhere
else
and
so
we
get
into
touch
with
half
a
county
but
coming
to
your
affairs
you
see
we
here
are
just
the
innermost
circle
most
of
the
women
who
came
from
london
missed
this
place
and
passed
us
by
thanks
be
now
that
poor
unfortunate
miss
grant
down
the
road
had
to
defend
herself
with
weapons
fortunately
she
strong
is
miss
grant
the
awful
woman
with
the
broomstick
asked
blanche
she
not
really
awful
my
dear
said
aunt
may
smiling
a
very
good
sort
a
little
rough
in
her
manners
perhaps
and
quite
mad
about
the
uselessness
of
the
creatures
we
used
to
know
as
men
but
a
fine
generous
unselfish
woman
if
she
does
boast
of
her
three
murders
did
she
tell
you
that
by
the
way
blanche
nodded
she
would
of
course
and
i
believe
it
true
but
her
theory
was
to
defend
her
own
people
she
said
they
all
have
died
if
she
had
i
not
sure
about
the
ethic
but
i
know
dear
old
sally
grant
meant
well
however
i
wandering
i
often
do
when
i
talk
like
this
the
point
was
that
just
this
little
circle
here
close
to
london
is
very
thickly
populated
and
there
precious
little
food
ready
to
be
got
any
way
but
you
have
to
pass
through
the
country
beyond
pinner
before
you
find
a
place
where
they
give
you
work
and
keep
you
there
a
surplus
in
the
next
ring
i
gather
too
much
labour
and
too
little
to
grow
you
have
to
push
out
into
the
chilterns
out
to
amersham
at
the
nearest
it
all
on
the
main
road
of
course
which
is
bad
in
a
general
way
because
that
the
road
they
all
took
but
i
think
if
you
cut
across
towards
wycombe
you
might
perhaps
find
a
place
of
some
sort
though
whether
feed
your
mother
free
gratis
i
ca
say
women
are
of
all
sorts
but
this
plague
has
made
more
friendly
to
one
another
or
perhaps
it
is
we
notice
it
more
and
the
worst
of
the
lot
are
the
wives
and
daughters
who
got
the
land
they
get
turned
out
though
sometimes
we
hear
about
it
the
london
women
have
made
raids
only
you
see
the
poor
dears
do
know
what
to
do
with
the
land
when
they
get
it
so
they
have
to
keep
the
few
who
do
know
to
teach
when
they
sensible
enough
the
raiders
i
mean
they
are
always
it
be
an
adventure
remarked
blanche
aunt
may
threw
away
the
very
short
end
of
her
second
cigarette
and
lighted
her
third
adventure
will
do
you
good
she
said
it
was
nearly
dark
under
the
elm
the
things
of
the
night
were
coming
out
occasionally
a
cockchafer
would
go
humming
past
them
the
bats
were
flitting
swiftly
and
silently
about
the
orchard
and
presently
an
owl
swept
by
in
one
great
stride
of
soundless
flight
how
they
are
all
coming
back
murmured
aunt
may
all
the
wild
things
i
never
saw
an
owl
here
before
this
year
i
should
be
frightened
if
you
were
here
said
blanche
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
yet
yet
in
a
few
years
time
perhaps
i
do
know
we
killed
a
wild
cat
who
came
after
the
chickens
a
few
days
ago
the
cats
have
gone
back
already
and
the
dogs
are
so
respectful
as
they
used
to
be
the
dogs
interbreed
i
suppose
and
evolve
a
common
form
strike
some
kind
of
average
in
a
beast
which
will
be
somewhere
near
the
ancestral
type
smaller
probably
i
do
know
it
a
wonderful
world
and
very
interesting
i
could
almost
wish
man
would
return
for
twenty
years
or
so
just
to
see
how
much
of
his
handiwork
nature
could
undo
in
the
interval
i
often
think
about
it
out
here
in
the
evenings
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
it
said
blanche
timidly
are
there
any
books
do
you
know
that
you
wo
want
books
my
dear
keep
your
eyes
open
and
think
they
lapsed
into
silence
again
the
third
cigarette
was
finished
but
aunt
may
gave
no
indication
of
a
desire
to
get
back
to
the
house
and
blanche
mind
was
so
excited
with
all
the
new
ideas
which
were
pouring
in
upon
her
that
she
had
forgotten
her
tiredness
it
awfully
interesting
she
said
at
last
it
all
so
different
mother
and
millie
hate
it
and
they
like
all
the
old
things
back
but
i
do
think
i
would
you
all
right
you
do
replied
her
companion
you
one
of
the
new
sort
though
you
might
never
have
found
it
out
if
it
been
for
the
plague
now
your
sister
will
do
one
of
two
things
in
my
opinion
either
she
stop
in
some
place
where
there
a
man
there
one
at
wycombe
by
the
way
and
have
children
or
turn
religious
blanche
was
about
to
ask
a
question
but
aunt
may
stopped
her
never
mind
about
the
man
my
dear
she
said
you
learn
quickly
enough
it
like
heaven
now
you
see
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
with
one
man
to
every
thousand
women
or
so
what
can
you
expect
it
no
good
kicking
against
it
it
got
to
be
where
fanny
she
broke
off
suddenly
with
a
little
snort
of
impatience
i
think
an
exception
she
went
on
i
like
talking
to
you
and
one
simply
ca
talk
to
allie
yet
so
just
i
have
one
more
she
took
out
her
cigarette
case
with
a
touch
of
impatience
it
was
dark
under
the
elm
now
and
she
had
to
hold
up
her
cigarette
case
close
to
her
face
in
order
to
see
the
contents
two
more
she
announced
it
a
festival
and
for
once
i
can
speak
my
mind
to
some
one
an
imprudence
perhaps
like
this
habit
of
smoking
but
i
shall
probably
never
see
you
again
and
i
sure
you
wo
tell
oh
no
interposed
blanche
eagerly
you
not
tired
you
do
want
to
go
to
bed
not
a
bit
i
love
being
out
here
i
ca
see
you
but
i
know
you
speaking
the
truth
said
aunt
may
after
a
pause
in
the
darkness
and
silence
of
the
night
i
will
make
a
confession
i
look
and
fifty
i
know
but
i
feel
absurdly
romantic
only
there
no
man
in
this
case
i
used
to
write
novels
my
dear
an
absurd
thing
for
any
spinster
to
do
but
they
paid
and
i
got
the
itch
for
that
the
one
outlet
i
miss
in
this
new
world
of
ours
sally
grant
and
i
ca
agree
and
in
any
case
she
wants
to
do
all
the
talking
and
sometimes
i
idiot
enough
to
go
on
writing
little
bits
even
now
when
i
have
become
a
capable
practical
woman
with
at
least
four
lives
dependent
upon
me
well
it
shows
anyhow
that
we
writing
women
were
all
fools
she
hung
on
that
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
continued
are
you
religious
i
do
know
i
suppose
so
we
always
went
to
church
at
home
said
blanche
i
thought
every
one
was
almost
not
quite
like
mrs
pollard
of
course
oh
well
said
aunt
may
there
no
harm
and
a
lot
of
good
in
being
religious
if
you
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
i
do
want
to
change
your
opinions
my
dear
it
just
a
question
to
me
of
the
right
way
and
i
ca
see
that
fanny
way
is
right
here
we
are
and
got
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
to
my
mind
that
means
facing
life
and
not
shutting
yourself
into
one
room
with
a
bible
and
spending
half
your
time
on
your
knees
fanny
never
was
good
for
much
she
brought
up
alfred
my
nephew
you
know
with
only
one
idea
and
she
stuffed
him
so
full
of
holiness
that
the
english
church
could
hold
him
and
he
had
to
work
some
of
it
off
by
going
over
to
rome
he
thought
he
have
better
chances
of
saintship
there
he
was
a
poor
pale
thing
anyway
of
course
that
was
anathema
to
fanny
she
might
have
forgiven
him
for
committing
a
murder
but
to
become
a
roman
catholic
oh
lord
she
been
praying
for
him
ever
since
and
my
dear
what
difference
can
it
make
alfred
apostasy
i
mean
do
you
think
it
matters
what
particular
form
of
worship
or
pettifogging
details
of
belief
you
adopt
why
ca
the
churches
take
each
other
for
granted
and
be
generous
enough
to
suppose
that
all
roads
lead
to
heaven
which
is
according
to
all
accounts
a
much
better
place
than
rome
but
oh
above
all
if
you
have
a
religion
do
be
practical
come
out
and
do
your
work
instead
of
sighing
and
and
wearying
dumb
heaven
with
fulsome
praise
and
lamentations
of
your
unworthiness
as
if
you
were
trying
to
propitiate
a
rich
customer
there
my
dear
i
wo
say
any
more
my
last
cigarette
done
and
wasted
because
i
was
too
excited
to
enjoy
it
i
know
i
been
disloyal
but
it
my
temperament
i
could
slap
fanny
sometimes
and
she
sha
have
allie
it
the
night
that
has
affected
me
i
shall
be
just
as
practical
as
ever
and
you
forget
that
you
seen
this
side
of
me
come
along
we
must
go
to
bed
this
is
the
greatest
night
of
my
life
thought
blanche
as
they
walked
back
in
silence
to
the
house
even
when
she
was
in
bed
she
did
not
go
to
sleep
at
once
she
lay
and
listened
to
the
heavy
breathing
of
her
mother
and
millie
and
she
wondered
everything
indeed
was
different
but
everybody
was
just
the
same
only
in
some
curious
way
individualities
seemed
more
pronounced
could
it
be
that
everybody
was
more
natural
that
there
was
less
restraint
blanche
was
not
introspective
she
did
not
test
the
theory
on
herself
she
thought
of
the
women
she
had
met
that
day
and
of
her
mother
and
millie
she
fell
asleep
determined
to
be
more
like
aunt
may
xv
from
sudbury
to
wycombe
allie
knocked
on
the
goslings
door
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
and
blanche
who
had
come
to
bed
two
hours
after
her
mother
and
sister
was
the
only
one
to
respond
she
woke
with
the
feeling
that
she
had
something
important
to
do
and
that
the
affair
was
in
some
way
pleasant
and
inspiring
millie
was
not
easily
roused
she
had
slept
heavily
and
did
not
approve
the
suggestion
that
she
should
get
up
and
dress
herself
all
right
all
right
she
mumbled
and
cuddled
down
under
the
bedclothes
like
a
dormouse
into
its
straw
oh
do
get
up
urged
blanche
impatiently
and
at
last
resorted
to
physical
force
what
is
the
matter
snapped
millie
struggling
to
maintain
her
hold
of
the
blankets
why
ca
you
leave
me
alone
because
it
time
to
get
up
lazy
said
blanche
continuing
the
struggle
well
i
said
i
get
up
in
a
minute
well
get
up
then
in
a
minute
no
now
oh
bother
said
millie
blanche
succeeded
at
last
in
obtaining
possession
of
the
blankets
you
wake
mother
was
millie
last
desperate
shaft
i
going
to
try
replied
blanche
millie
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
wondered
vaguely
where
she
was
these
scenes
had
often
been
enacted
at
wisteria
grove
and
her
mind
had
gone
back
to
those
delightful
days
of
peace
and
security
when
full
consciousness
returned
to
her
she
was
half
inclined
to
cry
and
more
than
half
inclined
to
go
to
sleep
again
mrs
gosling
was
quite
as
difficult
what
the
time
was
her
first
question
i
do
know
said
blanche
i
sure
it
not
seven
murmured
mrs
gosling
millie
still
sitting
on
the
bed
wondered
whether
blanche
would
let
her
get
to
the
blankets
which
were
tumbled
on
the
floor
a
few
feet
away
no
you
do
exclaimed
blanche
anticipating
the
attempt
finally
she
lost
her
temper
and
shook
her
mother
vigorously
at
that
mrs
gosling
sat
up
suddenly
and
stared
at
her
what
in
name
wrong
gel
she
asked
her
instinct
told
her
with
absolute
certainty
that
it
was
still
the
middle
of
the
night
by
wisteria
grove
standards
oh
my
goodness
i
going
to
have
my
hands
full
with
you
two
broke
out
blanche
impatiently
her
imagination
pictured
for
her
in
that
instant
how
great
the
trouble
would
be
she
would
never
be
able
to
wake
them
up
they
took
the
road
before
eight
aunt
may
was
generous
in
the
matter
of
eggs
and
fruit
and
she
left
her
many
urgent
duties
to
point
the
way
for
the
inexperienced
explorers
get
right
out
as
far
as
you
can
was
her
parting
word
of
advice
they
did
not
see
mrs
pollard
again
she
was
still
in
bed
when
they
set
out
despite
the
promise
of
another
cloudless
day
none
of
the
three
travellers
set
out
in
high
spirits
to
all
of
them
even
to
blanche
it
seemed
a
return
to
weariness
and
pain
to
start
out
once
more
pushing
that
abominable
truck
that
truck
represented
all
their
troubles
it
had
become
associated
with
all
the
discomforts
they
had
endured
since
they
left
the
putney
house
it
indicated
the
paucity
of
their
possessions
and
yet
it
was
intolerably
heavy
to
push
after
their
brief
return
to
the
comfort
and
stability
of
a
home
and
natural
food
this
adventuring
out
into
the
inhospitable
country
appeared
more
hopeless
than
ever
if
they
could
have
gone
without
the
truck
they
might
at
least
have
avoided
that
feeling
of
horrible
certainty
they
might
have
cheated
themselves
into
the
belief
that
they
would
return
the
truck
was
the
brand
of
their
vagabondage
mrs
gosling
did
not
spare
her
lamentations
concerning
the
hopelessness
of
their
endeavour
and
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
they
had
been
most
heartlessly
treated
by
aunt
may
turning
out
a
woman
of
my
age
into
the
roads
she
grumbled
she
might
kept
us
a
day
or
two
i
should
thought
it
ai
as
if
we
were
beggars
we
could
paid
for
what
we
she
had
indeed
made
the
suggestion
and
been
repulsed
aunt
may
had
firmly
put
the
offer
on
one
side
without
explanation
she
understood
that
explanations
would
be
wasted
on
mrs
gosling
millie
was
inclined
to
agree
with
her
mother
blanche
at
the
handle
did
not
interrupt
the
statement
of
their
grievances
she
was
occupied
with
the
problem
of
the
future
trying
to
think
out
some
plan
in
her
own
confused
inconsecutive
way
their
progress
was
tediously
slow
against
the
combined
brake
of
the
truck
and
mrs
gosling
they
did
not
average
two
miles
an
hour
and
even
before
they
came
to
pinner
it
was
becoming
obvious
to
the
two
girls
that
they
might
as
well
let
their
mother
ride
on
the
trolly
as
allow
her
to
lean
her
weight
upon
it
as
she
walked
they
took
the
road
through
wealdstone
to
avoid
the
hill
and
found
that
they
were
still
in
the
track
of
one
wing
of
the
foraging
army
which
had
preceded
them
that
first
rush
of
emigrants
had
ravaged
the
stores
and
houses
as
locusts
will
ravage
a
stretch
of
country
the
suburb
of
regular
villas
and
prim
shops
had
been
completely
looted
doors
stood
open
and
windows
were
smashed
the
spread
of
ugly
houses
lay
among
the
fields
like
an
unwholesome
eruption
awaiting
the
healing
process
of
nature
wealdstone
also
was
deserted
by
humanity
the
flood
had
swept
on
towards
the
open
country
but
as
they
approached
pinner
the
signs
of
devastation
and
desertion
began
to
give
way
here
and
there
women
could
be
seen
working
in
the
fields
one
or
two
children
scuttled
away
before
the
approach
of
the
goslings
and
hid
in
the
hedges
children
who
had
evidently
grown
furtive
and
suspicious
intimidated
by
the
experiences
of
the
past
two
months
and
when
the
outlying
houses
were
reached
detached
suburban
villas
once
occupied
by
relatively
wealthy
employers
it
was
evident
that
efforts
were
being
made
to
restore
the
wreckage
of
kitchen
gardens
the
goslings
had
reached
the
point
at
which
the
wave
had
broken
after
its
great
initial
energy
was
spent
somewhere
about
this
limit
varying
somewhat
according
to
local
conditions
the
real
disintegration
of
the
crowd
had
begun
as
the
numerous
tokens
of
the
road
had
shown
a
great
number
of
women
and
children
possibly
of
the
whole
crowd
had
died
of
starvation
and
disease
before
any
harbour
was
reached
from
this
circle
outwards
an
increasing
number
had
been
stayed
in
their
flight
by
the
opportunities
of
obtaining
food
work
was
urgently
demanded
for
the
future
but
the
determining
factor
was
the
present
supply
of
food
and
the
constriction
of
immediate
supply
had
decided
the
question
of
how
great
a
proportion
of
the
women
and
children
should
remain
here
about
pinner
was
more
land
than
the
limited
number
of
workers
could
till
but
little
of
it
was
arable
and
this
year
there
would
be
almost
no
harvest
of
grain
vaguely
blanche
realized
this
she
remembered
aunt
may
advice
to
keep
her
eyes
open
and
looking
about
her
as
she
walked
she
found
little
promise
of
security
in
the
grass
fields
and
the
rare
signs
of
human
activity
mrs
gosling
eager
to
find
some
home
at
any
price
expressed
her
usual
optimistic
opinion
with
regard
to
the
value
of
money
she
saw
signs
of
life
again
at
last
conditions
familiar
to
her
she
thought
that
they
were
returning
once
more
to
some
kind
of
recognizable
civilization
and
began
with
some
renewal
of
her
old
vigour
to
advise
that
they
should
find
an
hotel
or
inn
and
take
a
good
look
round
before
going
any
further
millie
heartened
by
her
mother
belief
was
of
much
the
same
opinion
and
blanche
was
summoned
from
the
pole
to
listen
to
the
proposition
she
shook
her
head
stubbornly
i
not
going
to
argue
it
out
all
over
again
she
said
you
can
just
look
round
and
see
for
yourselves
that
there
no
food
to
be
got
here
we
must
get
further
out
mrs
gosling
refused
to
be
convinced
and
advanced
her
superior
knowledge
of
the
world
to
support
her
judgment
of
the
case
oh
very
well
said
blanche
at
last
come
on
to
the
inn
and
see
for
yourselves
the
inn
however
was
deserted
all
its
available
supply
of
food
solid
and
liquid
had
long
been
exhausted
and
the
gardenless
house
had
offered
no
particular
attractions
as
a
residence
houses
were
cheap
in
that
place
the
whole
population
of
pinner
including
children
did
not
exceed
three
hundred
persons
they
found
a
woman
working
in
a
garden
near
by
and
she
with
perhaps
unnecessary
harshness
warned
them
that
they
could
not
stay
in
the
village
there
not
enough
food
for
us
as
it
is
she
said
and
made
some
reference
to
silly
londoners
that
was
an
expression
with
which
the
goslings
were
to
become
very
familiar
in
the
near
future
the
appeal
for
pity
fell
on
deaf
ears
mrs
gosling
learned
that
she
was
only
one
of
many
thousands
who
had
made
the
same
appeal
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
as
they
trudged
out
of
pinner
on
the
road
towards
northwood
it
was
then
blanche
suggested
that
her
mother
should
always
ride
on
the
trolly
except
when
they
were
facing
a
hill
and
after
a
few
weak
protestations
the
suggestion
was
accepted
the
trolly
was
lightened
of
various
useless
articles
of
furniture
a
grudging
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
mrs
gosling
and
the
party
pushed
on
at
a
slightly
improved
pace
after
her
disappointment
in
pinner
mrs
gosling
interest
in
life
began
rapidly
to
decline
seated
in
her
truck
she
fell
into
long
fits
of
brooding
on
the
past
she
was
too
old
and
too
stereotyped
to
change
the
future
held
no
hope
for
her
and
as
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
her
existence
faded
the
life
forces
within
her
surely
and
ever
more
rapidly
ebbed
reality
to
her
became
the
discomfort
of
the
sun
heat
the
dust
of
the
road
the
creak
and
scream
of
the
trolly
wheels
she
was
incapable
of
relating
herself
to
the
great
scheme
of
life
her
consciousness
was
limited
as
it
had
always
been
limited
to
her
immediate
surroundings
she
saw
herself
as
a
woman
outrageously
used
by
fate
but
to
fate
she
gave
no
name
the
very
idea
indeed
was
too
abstract
to
be
appreciated
by
her
blanche
millie
and
that
horrible
truck
were
all
that
was
left
of
her
world
and
in
spirit
she
still
moved
in
the
beloved
familiar
places
of
her
suburban
home
as
the
goslings
trudged
out
into
the
chilterns
they
came
into
new
conditions
soon
they
found
in
place
of
desolation
the
harvest
was
ripening
and
in
a
month
time
the
demand
for
labour
would
almost
equal
the
supply
for
the
labour
offered
was
quite
absurdly
unskilled
and
ten
women
would
be
required
to
perform
the
work
of
one
man
equipped
with
machines
but
at
the
end
of
july
the
surplus
of
women
almost
exclusively
londoners
had
no
employment
and
little
food
and
many
were
living
on
grass
nettles
leaves
any
green
stuff
they
could
boil
and
eat
together
with
such
scraps
of
meat
and
vegetables
as
they
could
steal
or
beg
their
experiments
with
wild
green
stuffs
often
resulted
in
some
form
of
poisoning
and
dysentery
and
starvation
were
rapidly
increasing
the
mortality
among
them
nevertheless
in
rickmansworth
houses
were
still
at
a
premium
and
many
of
those
who
camped
perforce
in
fields
or
by
the
roadside
were
too
enfeebled
by
to
stand
the
exposure
of
the
occasional
cold
wet
nights
the
majority
of
the
women
in
this
ring
were
those
who
had
been
too
weak
to
struggle
on
they
represented
the
class
least
fitted
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
new
conditions
the
stronger
and
more
capable
had
persisted
and
left
these
congested
areas
behind
them
and
it
was
evident
that
in
a
very
few
months
a
balance
between
labour
and
supply
would
be
struck
by
the
relentless
extermination
of
the
weakest
by
starvation
and
disease
blanche
if
she
was
unable
to
grasp
the
problem
which
was
being
so
inevitably
solved
by
the
forces
of
natural
law
was
at
least
able
to
recognize
clearly
enough
that
she
and
her
two
dependents
must
not
linger
in
the
district
to
which
they
had
now
come
aunt
may
had
warned
her
that
she
must
push
out
as
far
as
amersham
at
the
nearest
but
millie
was
too
tired
and
footsore
to
go
much
further
than
rickmansworth
that
night
and
after
a
fruitless
search
for
shelter
they
camped
out
half
a
mile
from
the
town
in
the
direction
of
chorley
wood
they
made
some
kind
of
a
shield
from
the
weather
by
emptying
and
tilting
the
trolly
and
they
hid
their
supply
of
food
behind
them
at
the
lowest
point
of
this
species
of
roof
the
two
girls
had
realized
that
that
supply
would
soon
be
raided
if
the
fact
of
its
existence
were
to
become
known
they
had
been
the
object
of
much
scrutiny
as
they
passed
and
their
appearance
of
had
prompted
endless
demands
for
food
from
that
pitiful
crowd
of
emaciated
women
and
children
it
had
been
a
demand
quickly
put
on
one
side
by
lying
their
applicants
found
it
only
too
easy
to
believe
that
the
goslings
had
no
food
hidden
in
the
truck
i
hated
to
refuse
some
of
blanche
said
as
they
carefully
hid
what
food
was
left
to
them
before
turning
in
for
the
night
but
what
good
would
our
little
bit
have
done
among
all
that
lot
it
would
have
been
gone
in
half
a
jiff
well
of
course
agreed
millie
mrs
gosling
had
taken
little
notice
of
the
starving
crowd
we
got
nothin
to
give
you
was
her
one
form
of
reply
she
might
have
been
dealing
with
hawkers
in
wisteria
grove
she
was
curiously
apathetic
all
that
afternoon
and
evening
and
raised
only
the
feeblest
protestation
against
the
necessity
for
sleeping
in
the
open
air
but
she
was
very
restless
during
the
night
her
limbs
twitched
and
she
moved
continually
muttering
and
sometimes
crying
out
and
as
the
three
women
were
all
huddled
together
partly
to
make
the
most
of
their
somewhat
insufficient
and
partly
because
they
were
afraid
of
the
terrors
of
the
open
air
both
blanche
and
millie
were
constantly
aroused
by
their
mother
movements
once
they
heard
her
calling
urgently
for
george
mother
odd
is
she
whispered
blanche
after
one
such
disturbance
do
you
think
she
going
to
be
ill
should
wonder
muttered
millie
who
would
be
in
the
morning
blanche
was
very
careful
with
their
food
for
breakfast
they
ate
only
part
of
a
tin
of
condensed
beef
between
them
mrs
gosling
indeed
ate
hardly
anything
the
eggs
which
they
had
brought
from
sudbury
they
reserved
chiefly
because
they
had
neither
water
nor
fire
they
drank
from
a
stream
later
and
at
midday
blanche
and
millie
each
ate
one
of
the
eggs
raw
mrs
gosling
refused
all
food
on
this
occasion
she
had
been
very
quiet
all
the
morning
and
had
made
little
complaint
when
she
had
been
forced
to
walk
the
many
hills
which
they
were
now
encountering
blanche
was
uneasy
and
tried
to
induce
her
mother
to
talk
do
you
feel
bad
mother
she
asked
continually
i
wish
i
could
get
was
all
the
reply
she
received
she
be
all
right
when
we
can
get
settled
somewhere
grumbled
millie
if
such
a
time
ever
comes
they
came
to
amersham
in
the
afternoon
the
signs
of
misery
and
starvation
were
here
less
marked
they
were
approaching
the
outer
edge
of
this
ring
of
compression
having
passed
through
the
node
at
rickmansworth
the
faint
relief
of
pressure
was
evidenced
to
some
extent
in
the
attitude
of
the
people
they
addressed
it
is
true
that
no
immediate
hope
of
food
and
employment
were
held
out
to
them
but
on
the
one
hand
blanche
inquiries
were
answered
with
less
acerbity
and
on
the
other
they
were
less
besieged
by
importunate
demands
for
charity
blanche
gave
an
egg
to
one
precocious
girl
of
thirteen
or
so
who
insisted
on
helping
them
to
push
the
truck
uphill
and
she
and
millie
watched
the
deft
way
in
which
the
child
broke
the
shell
at
one
end
and
sucked
out
the
contents
their
own
methods
had
been
both
unclean
and
wasteful
they
turned
off
the
aylesbury
road
towards
high
wycombe
late
in
the
afternoon
and
about
a
mile
from
amersham
came
to
a
farm
where
they
made
their
last
inquiry
that
day
blanche
saw
signs
of
life
in
the
outbuildings
and
went
to
investigate
leaving
millie
and
her
mother
to
guard
the
truck
she
found
three
women
and
a
girl
of
fourteen
or
so
milking
for
some
minutes
she
stood
watching
them
the
women
after
one
glance
at
her
proceeding
with
their
work
without
paying
her
any
further
attention
but
at
last
the
eldest
of
the
three
rose
from
her
stool
with
a
sigh
of
relief
picked
up
her
wooden
bucket
of
milk
gave
the
cow
a
resounding
slap
on
the
side
and
then
turning
to
blanche
said
well
my
gal
what
for
you
will
you
change
two
pints
of
milk
for
a
small
tin
of
tongue
asked
blanche
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
offered
any
of
their
precious
tinned
meats
in
exchange
for
other
food
but
she
wanted
milk
for
her
mother
who
had
hardly
eaten
anything
that
day
the
two
other
women
and
the
girl
looked
round
and
regarded
blanche
with
the
first
signs
of
interest
they
had
shown
tongue
eh
said
the
older
woman
where
from
did
you
get
tongue
my
gal
london
replied
blanche
tersely
when
did
you
leave
there
asked
the
woman
and
then
blanche
was
engaged
in
a
series
of
searching
questions
respecting
the
country
she
had
passed
through
you
can
have
the
milk
if
you
anything
to
put
it
in
said
the
woman
at
last
and
blanche
went
to
fetch
the
tongue
and
the
two
bottles
that
they
had
had
from
aunt
may
the
bottles
had
to
be
scalded
a
precaution
that
had
not
occurred
to
blanche
and
one
of
the
other
women
was
sent
to
carry
out
the
operation
well
your
tale
do
tell
us
much
said
the
woman
of
the
farm
but
we
always
pass
the
news
here
now
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
blanche
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
can
sleep
here
in
the
outhouses
if
you
a
mind
to
said
the
woman
but
i
warn
you
we
get
a
crowd
silly
londoners
like
yourself
for
the
most
part
but
we
find
a
use
for
somehow
though
i
give
the
lot
for
three
labourers
she
paused
and
twisted
her
mouth
on
one
side
reflectively
ah
well
she
went
on
with
a
sigh
no
use
grieving
over
them
that
gone
all
i
was
goin
to
say
was
if
you
sleep
here
you
better
keep
an
eye
on
what
food
you
got
with
you
my
lot
have
it
before
you
can
say
knife
if
they
get
half
a
chance
it
is
us
girls
me
and
my
sister
explained
blanche
my
mother
she
bad
i
afraid
if
she
could
sleep
in
your
kitchen
she
would
steal
anything
after
a
short
hesitation
the
woman
consented
yet
neither
the
glory
of
being
once
more
within
the
four
walls
of
a
house
nor
the
refreshment
of
the
milk
which
she
drank
readily
enough
seemed
appreciably
to
rouse
mrs
gosling
spirits
the
woman
of
the
farm
a
kindly
enough
creature
plied
the
old
lady
with
questions
but
received
few
and
confused
answers
in
reply
mrs
gosling
seemed
dazed
and
stupid
a
touch
of
the
sun
the
widow
thought
the
sun
been
cruel
strong
the
past
week
she
said
but
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
get
her
to
shelter
ah
that
the
trouble
said
blanche
that
night
the
farmer
widow
said
no
more
on
that
subject
she
allowed
the
three
goslings
to
sleep
in
an
upstair
room
in
which
there
was
one
small
bed
for
the
mother
and
the
two
girls
slept
on
the
floor
exchanging
confidence
for
confidence
they
brought
their
truck
into
the
kitchen
and
then
the
farmer
widow
proceeded
to
lock
up
for
the
night
an
elaborate
business
which
included
the
fastening
of
all
windows
and
shutters
it
a
thievin
crowd
we
got
about
here
she
explained
and
you
ca
blame
them
or
anyone
when
there
ai
enough
food
to
go
round
but
we
have
to
be
careful
for
let
go
their
own
way
and
they
eat
up
everything
in
a
week
and
then
starve
it
looks
like
you
being
hard
on
but
it
for
their
own
good
some
of
course
she
went
on
as
you
have
got
to
get
shut
of
only
yesterday
i
had
to
send
one
of
packing
a
jew
woman
she
was
called
mrs
isaacson
or
something
she
was
a
caution
blanche
wondered
idly
if
this
were
the
same
mrs
isaacson
who
had
stayed
too
long
with
aunt
may
the
woman
of
the
farm
roused
the
goslings
at
sunrise
and
she
like
aunt
may
had
a
brisk
practical
morning
manner
she
gave
the
travellers
no
more
food
but
when
they
were
nearly
ready
to
take
the
road
again
she
gave
them
one
valuable
piece
of
information
if
i
was
you
she
said
i
make
through
wycombe
straight
along
the
road
here
and
go
up
over
the
hill
to
marlow
mind
you
they
let
every
one
stop
there
but
you
look
two
healthy
gals
enough
and
it
getting
on
towards
harvest
when
there
be
work
as
you
can
do
marlow
repeated
blanche
fixing
the
name
in
her
memory
the
farmer
widow
nodded
there
a
man
there
she
said
a
queer
sort
by
all
accounts
not
like
sam
evans
the
butcher
at
wycombe
he
ai
seems
as
this
marlow
chap
do
have
no
truck
with
gals
except
setting
to
work
however
time
show
he
may
change
his
mind
yet
they
had
some
difficulty
with
mrs
gosling
she
refused
feebly
to
leave
the
house
i
ai
fit
to
go
out
she
complained
and
when
they
insisted
she
asked
if
they
were
going
home
best
say
whispered
the
woman
of
the
farm
the
sun
got
to
her
head
a
bit
she
be
all
right
when
you
get
her
to
marlow
blanche
accepted
the
suggestion
and
by
this
subterfuge
mrs
gosling
was
persuaded
into
the
truck
the
girl
found
the
ruins
of
an
umbrella
which
they
rigged
up
to
protect
her
from
the
sun
blanche
and
millie
were
quite
convinced
now
that
their
mother
was
suffering
from
a
slight
attack
of
sunstroke
both
the
girls
were
still
footsore
and
one
of
millie
boots
had
worn
into
a
hole
but
they
had
a
definite
objective
at
last
and
only
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
to
travel
before
reaching
it
we
shall
be
there
by
midday
said
blanche
hopefully
unconsciously
every
one
was
using
a
new
measure
of
time
xvi
the
young
butcher
of
high
wycombe
near
wycombe
a
woman
rose
from
under
the
hedge
as
the
goslings
approached
and
came
out
into
the
middle
of
the
road
she
was
a
stout
florid
woman
whose
age
might
have
been
anything
between
forty
and
fifty
her
gait
and
the
droop
of
her
shoulders
rather
than
the
flaccidity
of
her
rather
loose
skin
gave
her
the
appearance
of
being
past
middle
age
goot
morning
she
said
as
the
goslings
came
up
if
it
iss
no
inconvenience
i
would
like
to
come
with
you
she
spoke
with
a
foreign
accent
thickening
her
final
consonants
and
giving
a
different
value
to
some
of
her
vowels
where
to
asked
blanche
curtly
ah
that
what
does
it
matter
returned
the
woman
i
have
been
living
with
a
farmer
wife
further
back
along
the
road
there
but
she
was
not
company
for
me
she
was
common
now
i
see
that
you
and
your
mother
are
not
common
and
i
do
not
care
to
live
with
wives
but
where
we
go
does
it
matter
we
all
go
to
find
work
in
the
fields
aristocrat
as
much
as
peasant
but
iss
it
not
better
that
we
who
are
not
peasants
should
go
together
millie
giggled
surreptitiously
and
mrs
gosling
appeared
conscious
of
the
fact
that
some
one
was
addressing
them
we
goin
she
remarked
and
millie
gently
prodded
her
in
the
back
goin
repeated
mrs
gosling
firmly
ach
you
are
lucky
there
are
few
that
have
homes
now
replied
the
strange
woman
i
had
a
home
once
how
long
ago
now
during
two
months
i
have
no
home
she
was
evidently
on
the
verge
of
tears
mother
got
a
touch
of
the
sun
blanche
said
in
a
low
voice
and
we
have
to
pretend
we
going
home
you
need
tell
her
we
not
have
no
fear
replied
the
stranger
i
am
all
that
is
most
discreet
yes
blanche
hardened
her
heart
this
woman
took
too
much
for
granted
i
do
see
it
any
use
your
coming
with
us
she
said
ach
we
others
we
should
cling
together
said
the
stranger
with
a
large
gesture
we
nobody
replied
blanche
curtly
it
iss
well
to
say
that
i
know
there
iss
good
reason
i
too
must
tell
the
common
people
that
i
am
a
nobody
i
call
myself
even
mrs
isaacson
but
between
us
there
iss
no
need
to
say
what
iss
not
true
i
can
see
what
you
are
although
i
am
not
english
i
have
lived
many
years
already
in
england
and
i
can
see
it
iss
well
that
we
cling
together
yes
oh
burst
out
blanche
you
mrs
isaacson
are
you
i
heard
of
you
for
one
moment
mrs
isaacson
fine
eyes
seemed
to
look
inwards
in
an
instantaneous
review
of
her
past
ach
so
then
we
are
friends
already
she
said
cautiously
i
heard
of
you
from
aunt
may
said
blanche
and
the
faint
air
of
respect
with
which
she
pronounced
the
name
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
alert
jewess
ach
the
so
dear
and
so
clever
auntie
may
she
said
but
she
iss
too
kind
and
work
so
hard
while
her
sister
do
always
nothing
see
i
will
help
you
to
draw
your
poor
mother
who
has
a
touch
of
the
sun
you
and
i
at
the
handle
and
your
beautiful
sister
to
push
while
we
talk
a
little
of
the
clever
auntie
may
yes
blanche
had
been
forewarned
she
could
only
put
one
construction
on
the
little
she
had
heard
of
mrs
isaacson
but
the
jewess
manner
no
less
than
her
conversation
was
subtly
flattering
moreover
she
had
made
no
appeal
for
help
finally
there
was
a
certain
urgency
about
her
a
force
of
will
which
blanche
found
it
difficult
to
resist
and
as
the
girl
still
hesitated
mrs
isaacson
bravely
seized
her
side
of
the
trolly
handle
and
the
procession
moved
on
the
goslings
found
a
use
for
her
when
they
came
to
the
drop
of
amersham
hill
going
down
into
high
wycombe
blanche
proposed
that
mrs
gosling
should
walk
down
but
the
old
lady
did
not
seem
to
understand
her
she
looked
perplexed
and
kept
saying
i
do
remember
this
road
are
you
sure
we
goin
right
blanche
ah
she
must
not
walk
in
this
heat
put
in
mrs
isaacson
we
three
can
manage
very
well
and
indeed
although
she
manifestly
suffered
greatly
from
the
exertion
the
jewess
was
of
very
great
assistance
in
retarding
the
speed
of
the
trolly
as
they
made
the
perilous
descent
after
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
calmly
telling
her
to
go
her
own
way
by
the
time
they
had
crossed
the
almost
deserted
town
at
that
hour
nearly
all
the
women
were
either
in
their
houses
or
working
in
gardens
and
fields
and
had
found
their
way
to
the
marlow
road
mrs
isaacson
had
quite
become
one
of
the
party
and
by
no
means
the
least
energetic
we
have
something
to
eat
and
some
milk
when
we
get
through
the
town
said
blanche
as
they
faced
the
long
hill
up
to
handy
cross
presently
presently
replied
the
heaving
mrs
isaacson
as
though
food
were
of
little
importance
to
her
but
accepting
the
admission
that
she
had
earned
the
right
to
share
equally
with
the
others
their
first
burst
of
energy
after
they
had
faced
the
ascent
brought
them
to
the
gates
of
wycombe
abbey
and
there
they
decided
to
rest
and
lunch
blissfully
ignorant
of
the
long
climb
which
lay
before
them
it
will
be
nice
and
quiet
here
in
the
shade
suggested
mrs
isaacson
the
old
conventions
would
not
have
suffered
them
to
sit
and
eat
thus
under
the
walls
at
the
very
gates
of
wycombe
abbey
their
clothes
and
their
boots
were
wearing
badly
and
mrs
isaacson
at
least
was
not
too
clean
it
was
noticeable
however
that
despite
the
dryness
of
the
weather
little
dust
clung
to
them
the
surface
of
the
roads
had
not
been
pounded
and
crushed
into
powder
during
the
past
six
weeks
by
the
constant
passage
of
wheeled
traffic
and
even
in
the
tracks
frequented
by
farm
carts
the
roads
were
stained
with
green
indeed
everything
was
greener
than
in
the
old
days
everything
was
more
vigorous
whether
because
the
year
had
been
favourable
or
because
it
was
relieved
from
the
burden
of
choking
dust
which
it
had
had
to
endure
in
other
years
from
may
onwards
the
vegetation
in
hedges
and
by
the
wayside
appeared
to
grow
more
strongly
and
with
a
greater
and
by
contrast
with
this
vigour
and
cleanness
of
plant
life
the
four
women
in
their
tumbled
clothes
and
untidy
hats
feeble
and
unsightly
remnants
of
forgotten
fashion
were
as
much
out
of
place
as
if
they
had
been
set
down
in
ancient
greece
the
dowdy
foolishness
of
their
apparel
marked
them
out
from
every
other
living
thing
about
them
they
were
intruders
despoilers
of
beauty
some
dim
consciousness
of
this
came
to
blanche
they
had
spoken
little
as
they
ate
mrs
gosling
would
touch
nothing
but
milk
and
mrs
isaacson
strove
desperately
and
with
some
success
to
control
the
greed
that
showed
in
the
concentrated
eagerness
of
her
eyes
and
the
grasping
crook
of
her
fingers
and
when
they
had
finished
lingering
in
the
relief
of
the
shade
they
were
still
silent
it
seemed
as
if
the
first
word
spoken
must
necessarily
hasten
the
continuation
of
their
journey
oh
bother
this
old
hat
said
blanche
at
last
i
going
to
take
mine
off
and
she
drew
out
the
solitary
pin
which
remained
to
her
and
cast
the
hat
into
the
ditch
that
wo
do
it
any
good
remarked
millie
but
she
too
took
off
her
hat
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
going
to
chuck
hats
said
blanche
what
the
good
of
mrs
isaacson
looked
doubtful
they
are
a
protection
from
the
sun
she
said
allie
never
wore
a
hat
and
she
did
come
to
any
harm
returned
blanche
no
said
mrs
isaacson
and
looked
thoughtful
millie
was
running
her
fingers
through
the
masses
of
her
hair
loosening
it
and
lifting
it
from
her
head
it
is
a
relief
she
remarked
my
head
gets
so
hot
ah
said
mrs
isaacson
and
what
beautiful
hair
it
does
not
seem
right
to
hide
it
i
haf
a
comb
in
my
bag
it
is
almost
all
i
haf
left
let
me
now
comb
your
beautiful
hair
for
you
oh
do
you
bother
said
millie
sheepishly
but
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
do
lose
the
she
warned
her
lady
maid
it
seems
so
funny
out
here
in
the
open
road
giggled
millie
mrs
isaacson
praise
was
fulsome
blanche
watched
without
comment
mrs
gosling
was
plunged
in
meditation
she
was
involved
in
an
immense
problem
relating
to
the
housekeeping
at
wisteria
grove
she
was
debating
whether
the
lace
curtains
at
the
front
windows
could
be
washed
at
home
when
they
went
back
suddenly
the
attention
of
the
three
younger
women
was
caught
by
unnatural
sounds
that
came
from
the
further
side
of
the
wall
against
which
they
were
leaning
sounds
of
voices
laughing
and
singing
the
crunch
of
wheels
and
the
stamping
of
horses
the
two
girls
jumped
to
their
feet
mrs
isaacson
rose
more
deliberately
with
a
grunt
of
expostulation
mrs
gosling
was
in
a
world
far
removed
and
continued
to
debate
her
problem
millie
hands
were
fumbling
at
her
hair
and
blanche
was
first
at
the
gate
oh
my
she
exclaimed
why
whatever
goody
squealed
millie
still
struggling
with
her
loose
mane
the
centre
and
object
of
the
curious
crowd
which
moved
slowly
down
the
drive
was
a
landau
and
pair
the
horses
were
decorated
as
if
for
a
fête
grotesquely
foolishly
decorated
with
roses
syringa
and
buttercups
made
into
shapeless
bunches
and
tied
to
the
harness
three
or
four
women
walked
at
the
horses
heads
leading
them
with
absurdly
beflowered
ropes
round
the
landau
a
dozen
girls
and
young
women
were
dancing
chattering
singing
laughing
constantly
turning
to
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
for
whose
benefit
the
whole
performance
was
being
conducted
some
of
them
had
their
necks
and
breasts
bare
and
all
appeared
to
be
frankly
shameless
they
twisted
and
danced
with
clumsy
eagerness
threw
themselves
about
screamed
and
shrieked
unaware
of
any
observer
but
the
one
whose
notice
they
were
seeking
to
attract
they
were
graceless
civilized
savages
bacchantes
who
had
never
known
the
beauty
of
unconscious
abandonment
there
was
the
ugliness
of
conscious
purpose
in
their
every
attitude
and
no
trace
of
the
freedom
that
comes
from
careless
rapture
in
the
carriage
a
man
and
a
woman
were
sitting
side
by
side
the
man
was
young
with
strong
claims
to
physical
beauty
tall
swarthy
with
boldly
modelled
features
and
heavily
lidded
eyes
but
his
skin
was
coarse
the
bulk
of
his
body
was
too
gross
for
clean
muscular
strength
his
curly
hair
was
thinning
at
the
temples
his
loose
mouth
leered
and
gaped
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
tweed
his
great
red
fingers
were
covered
with
rings
he
wore
a
heavy
gold
bangle
on
each
thick
round
wrist
and
a
sweet
frail
rose
was
thrust
into
his
black
and
greasy
hair
the
woman
beside
him
was
the
typical
courtesan
of
the
ages
and
her
eyes
were
eloquent
with
the
subtleties
of
love
with
invitation
retreat
fear
and
desire
had
she
been
dressed
becomingly
she
would
have
been
beautiful
but
she
was
english
and
modern
and
her
great
meaningless
hat
and
senseless
garments
were
of
the
fashion
that
had
been
in
vogue
just
before
the
plague
this
reigning
sultana
and
her
lover
were
more
incongruous
in
that
setting
than
the
two
dishevelled
girls
who
retreated
timidly
to
let
the
landau
pass
out
between
the
great
iron
gates
the
bacchantes
eyed
the
goslings
with
obvious
disfavour
but
the
beauty
in
the
landau
seemed
unaware
of
their
presence
until
her
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sight
of
millie
hair
it
was
all
down
again
rippling
and
spreading
to
her
waist
the
young
butcher
had
been
lolling
back
in
a
corner
of
his
carriage
magnificently
indolent
sure
of
worship
but
his
satiety
was
pierced
by
the
sight
of
that
flaming
mane
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
millie
with
the
experienced
eyes
which
had
served
him
so
well
in
his
judgment
of
cattle
a
jiff
he
commanded
the
nymphs
at
his
horses
bridles
and
the
carriage
was
stopped
millie
covered
with
shame
shrank
back
and
cowered
behind
blanche
who
threw
up
her
chin
and
met
the
butcher
eyes
with
all
the
contempt
of
which
she
was
capable
little
enough
perhaps
for
she
too
was
weak
with
unreasoning
terror
behind
their
backs
the
jewess
grimaced
her
scorn
of
them
you
need
be
afraid
of
me
i
ai
goin
to
yer
began
the
butcher
but
his
lady
interrupted
him
her
fine
eyes
grew
bright
with
anger
if
you
stop
here
i
shall
get
out
she
said
and
her
inflexion
was
not
that
of
the
people
the
butcher
visibly
hesitated
it
may
be
that
this
chain
had
held
him
too
long
and
was
beginning
to
gall
him
but
he
looked
at
her
and
wavered
no
in
stoppin
he
muttered
pass
the
news
an
that
are
you
going
on
demanded
the
beauty
fiercely
all
right
all
right
he
returned
sullenly
you
needen
get
so
blasted
about
it
old
gal
oh
gow
on
you
he
added
to
the
nymphs
wot
the
are
yer
starin
at
as
the
landau
moved
on
he
looked
back
once
at
millie
what
a
brute
said
blanche
when
the
procession
had
passed
on
down
the
hill
towards
wycombe
how
he
stared
at
my
hair
said
millie
with
a
giggle
i
did
try
to
get
it
up
but
it
that
stubborn
with
the
heat
or
something
lucky
for
us
he
had
that
creature
with
him
commented
blanche
millie
assented
without
fervour
she
was
bold
enough
now
the
danger
had
passed
mrs
isaacson
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
attempted
no
criticism
of
the
adventure
you
must
let
me
do
up
your
beautiful
hair
she
said
to
the
simpering
millie
millie
was
grateful
it
is
kind
of
you
mrs
isaacson
i
sure
she
said
my
hair
is
a
trouble
i
sometimes
think
i
cut
it
all
off
and
be
done
with
it
she
appeared
excited
and
chatted
incessantly
while
the
continued
and
blanche
restored
the
remains
of
their
meal
to
the
trolly
with
some
difficulty
they
succeeded
in
getting
mrs
gosling
back
into
her
carriage
she
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
procession
but
as
they
were
starting
again
she
awoke
from
her
abstraction
to
ask
when
expect
we
be
blanche
i
been
thinkin
about
them
curtains
in
the
we
be
home
in
an
hour
or
two
now
blanche
said
reassuringly
she
did
not
know
what
a
struggle
awaited
them
before
they
should
top
the
hill
at
handy
cross
mrs
isaacson
had
forsaken
her
place
at
the
pole
i
shall
be
able
to
push
more
strongly
behind
she
had
said
but
despite
the
theoretical
gain
in
mechanical
advantage
obtained
by
the
new
arrangement
the
hill
seemed
they
had
to
rest
continually
and
always
they
looked
with
increasing
irritation
at
the
quiet
figure
in
the
trolly
chief
cause
of
their
distress
i
believe
she
could
walk
all
right
millie
broke
out
at
last
if
it
was
for
a
little
way
it
would
help
commented
mrs
isaacson
but
when
blanche
put
the
proposition
to
her
mother
mrs
gosling
seemed
unable
to
comprehend
it
and
pity
influenced
them
to
renew
the
struggle
so
they
toiled
on
with
growing
impatience
until
they
reached
level
ground
again
and
presently
looking
down
over
the
long
slope
of
the
valley
saw
two
miles
and
a
half
away
the
spire
of
marlow
church
they
rested
under
a
hedge
for
a
time
and
when
they
started
again
millie
followed
her
sister
example
and
discarded
her
hat
blanche
with
a
certain
courage
of
opinion
had
left
hers
under
the
walls
of
wycombe
abbey
but
millie
hat
found
a
place
in
the
trolly
the
ease
of
the
long
descent
permitted
a
renewal
of
conversation
and
mrs
isaacson
and
millie
talked
in
undertones
as
they
made
their
way
down
towards
marlow
blanche
took
little
notice
of
them
she
was
struggling
perplexedly
with
the
problems
of
life
mrs
presence
was
negligible
that
was
a
very
handsome
fellow
in
the
carriage
remarked
mrs
isaacson
suddenly
i
think
you
do
well
not
to
go
near
that
place
again
her
fine
eyes
fixedly
regarded
the
broad
rusty
back
of
mrs
gosling
and
the
broken
ribs
of
her
umbrella
millie
simpered
oh
i
should
be
safe
enough
his
wife
see
to
that
she
was
not
his
wife
returned
mrs
isaacson
men
would
not
marry
now
that
they
are
so
few
well
there
a
thing
to
say
exclaimed
millie
on
a
note
of
expostulation
interested
nevertheless
it
iss
true
continued
mrs
isaacson
i
haf
heard
of
this
handsome
young
fellow
he
iss
a
butcher
and
he
goes
every
day
to
kill
the
sheep
and
cows
because
the
women
do
not
like
that
work
and
he
iss
very
strong
and
clever
also
he
teach
a
few
of
the
women
how
to
cut
up
the
sheep
and
the
cows
and
he
iss
much
admired
it
iss
of
course
by
all
the
young
women
but
he
does
not
marry
because
he
is
one
man
among
so
many
women
and
it
would
not
be
right
that
he
should
love
only
one
for
so
there
would
be
so
few
children
and
the
world
would
die
yes
but
he
has
for
a
time
one
who
iss
favourite
for
another
time
another
favourite
and
that
iss
why
i
warn
you
not
to
return
because
i
see
that
he
admire
your
so
beautiful
hair
and
i
see
that
if
you
had
not
been
so
modest
and
so
good
and
hide
behind
your
sister
he
would
have
come
down
from
his
carriage
and
put
you
up
there
beside
him
and
he
would
have
said
to
that
bold
ugly
woman
i
tire
of
you
i
will
haf
beside
me
this
one
who
iss
young
and
beautiful
and
has
hair
of
gold
it
iss
not
safe
for
you
there
oh
i
say
commented
millie
it
iss
true
nodded
mrs
isaacson
with
intensest
conviction
oh
well
thank
goodness
i
not
one
of
that
sort
said
millie
warm
in
the
knowledge
of
her
virtue
truly
not
assented
mrs
isaacson
you
must
not
be
displeased
that
i
warn
you
it
iss
not
your
goodness
that
i
doubt
it
iss
that
this
man
iss
so
powerful
he
iss
able
to
do
what
he
wishes
he
iss
a
king
goody
was
the
mark
of
surprise
with
which
millie
punctuated
this
remarkable
piece
of
information
and
for
several
yards
they
trudged
on
in
silence
but
millie
soon
revived
this
fascinating
subject
by
saying
thoughtfully
well
you
do
catch
me
over
there
again
truly
not
it
iss
not
wise
agreed
mrs
isaacson
and
proceeded
to
enlarge
upon
millie
dangerous
beauty
it
was
a
topic
entirely
new
to
millie
she
simpered
and
giggled
disclaimed
her
attractions
protested
that
mrs
isaacson
was
getting
at
her
and
became
so
absorbed
in
the
fascination
of
her
disavowal
that
she
forgot
her
weariness
her
tender
feet
naked
to
the
road
in
two
places
and
all
her
discouragements
she
walked
with
a
more
conscious
air
straightening
her
back
and
lifting
her
head
the
blood
moved
more
freely
in
her
veins
and
she
presently
became
so
vivacious
in
her
replies
that
blanche
was
aroused
to
a
sense
of
something
unfamiliar
she
checked
the
trolly
and
looked
back
at
her
sister
past
the
quiet
brooding
figure
of
mrs
gosling
what
is
it
mill
she
asked
oh
nothing
replied
millie
we
were
just
talking
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourselves
said
blanche
we
were
saying
that
we
shall
soon
now
arrive
at
some
place
where
we
can
rest
yes
put
in
mrs
isaacson
and
thus
established
a
ground
of
confidence
between
herself
and
millie
i
dunno
returned
blanche
she
sighed
and
looked
round
her
in
the
fields
between
them
and
marlow
they
could
see
here
and
there
little
figures
stooping
and
straightening
ooh
exclaimed
millie
suddenly
what
asked
blanche
there
another
man
said
millie
pointing
we
better
scoot
but
they
made
no
attempt
to
put
such
an
impossible
plan
into
action
the
man
had
evidently
seen
them
he
was
coming
towards
them
across
one
of
the
fields
shouting
to
attract
their
attention
hi
wait
a
minute
they
thought
he
was
saying
mill
exclaimed
blanche
with
extraordinary
emphasis
what
asked
millie
nervously
she
was
flushed
and
trembling
do
you
see
who
it
is
it
is
the
one
out
of
the
carriage
hesitated
millie
no
silly
it
that
young
fellow
who
used
to
live
with
us
our
mr
fastidious
what
was
his
name
thrale
you
remember
goody
said
millie
she
was
conscious
of
a
quite
inexplicable
feeling
of
disappointment
he
iss
a
friend
yes
asked
mrs
isaacson
book
iii
womankind
in
the
making
xvii
london
to
marlow
the
history
of
mankind
is
the
history
of
human
law
the
larger
ordinances
of
the
universe
are
commonly
referred
to
some
superior
lawgiver
under
such
names
as
god
and
action
names
which
appear
mutually
subversive
only
to
the
bigot
whether
theologian
or
biologist
these
larger
ordinances
sometimes
appear
inflexible
as
in
the
domain
of
physics
and
chemistry
sometimes
empirical
as
in
the
development
of
species
but
we
may
believe
that
if
they
change
at
all
the
period
of
change
is
so
great
as
to
be
outside
any
possibility
of
observation
by
a
few
thousand
generations
of
mankind
human
law
on
the
other
hand
is
tentative
without
sound
precedent
and
in
its
very
nature
mutable
in
our
miserably
limited
record
of
history
that
paltry
ten
thousand
years
which
is
but
a
single
tick
of
the
cosmic
watch
we
have
been
unable
to
formulate
any
overruling
law
to
which
other
laws
are
subject
climate
race
and
condition
impose
certain
limitations
and
within
that
enceinte
civilizations
have
developed
a
system
of
rules
increasing
always
in
complexity
and
have
then
failed
to
maintain
their
place
in
the
competitive
struggle
it
has
been
rashly
suggested
that
the
overriding
law
of
laws
is
that
rigidity
is
fatal
to
the
nation
an
analogy
has
been
found
in
the
growth
of
the
child
here
and
there
some
bold
spirit
has
ventured
the
daring
hypothesis
that
if
a
young
child
be
confined
within
a
perfectly
fitting
iron
shell
he
will
not
grow
such
speculations
however
do
not
appeal
to
mankind
as
a
whole
perhaps
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
nothing
appals
us
so
much
as
the
idea
that
man
is
capable
of
growth
is
it
not
inconceivable
that
any
race
of
men
could
be
wiser
more
perfect
than
ourselves
nevertheless
out
of
all
vague
speculation
one
deliciously
certain
axiom
presents
itself
namely
that
mankind
can
not
live
without
law
of
some
kind
the
most
primitive
savage
has
his
ordinances
the
least
primary
concussion
of
individuals
develops
a
rule
of
practice
whether
it
takes
such
diverse
forms
as
hit
first
or
present
the
other
cheek
although
the
latter
rule
has
not
yet
been
developed
beyond
the
stage
of
theory
in
the
unprecedented
year
of
the
new
plague
the
old
rules
were
thrown
into
the
melting
pot
but
within
three
months
humanity
was
evolving
precedents
for
a
new
statute
book
the
concussions
of
these
three
months
were
fierce
and
destructive
women
in
the
face
of
death
killed
and
stole
in
the
old
primitive
ways
unhampered
now
by
the
necessity
to
kill
and
steal
according
to
the
tedious
rules
of
civilization
rules
that
women
had
never
been
foolish
enough
to
reverence
in
the
letter
all
those
complex
and
incomprehensible
laws
had
been
made
by
men
for
men
and
after
the
plague
there
was
none
to
administer
them
for
no
women
and
few
men
had
ever
had
the
least
idea
what
the
law
was
even
the
lawgivers
themselves
had
had
to
wait
for
the
pronouncement
of
some
prejudiced
or
unprejudiced
judge
women
had
long
known
what
our
bumbles
can
only
learn
by
bitter
experience
inspired
to
vision
in
some
moment
of
fury
or
desolation
but
within
three
months
of
the
first
great
exodus
of
women
from
the
town
one
dominant
law
was
being
brought
to
birth
it
was
not
written
on
tables
of
stone
nor
incorporated
in
any
swollen
dyspeptic
book
of
statutes
it
was
not
formulated
by
logic
nor
was
it
the
outcome
of
serious
thought
by
any
individual
or
by
a
solemn
committee
the
law
rose
into
recognition
because
it
was
a
necessity
for
the
life
of
the
majority
and
although
that
majority
was
not
compact
had
no
common
deliberate
purpose
and
had
never
formulated
their
demand
in
precise
language
the
new
law
came
into
being
before
harvest
and
was
accepted
by
all
but
a
small
resentful
minority
of
aristocrats
and
landowners
as
a
supreme
ordinance
indisputably
just
this
law
was
that
every
woman
had
a
right
to
her
share
in
the
bounty
of
nature
and
the
corollary
was
that
she
earned
her
right
by
labour
in
those
days
the
justice
of
the
principle
was
perfectly
obvious
so
obvious
indeed
that
the
law
came
to
birth
without
the
obstetric
skill
of
any
parliament
whatever
it
is
now
impossible
to
say
why
such
different
types
of
male
humanity
as
jasper
thrale
george
gosling
or
the
bacchus
of
wycombe
abbey
escaped
the
plague
the
bacillus
surely
a
strangely
individual
type
it
must
have
been
was
never
isolated
nor
the
pathology
of
the
disease
investigated
the
germ
was
some
new
unprecedented
growth
which
ran
through
a
fierce
cycle
of
development
within
a
few
months
changed
its
nature
as
it
swarmed
into
every
corner
of
the
earth
and
finally
expired
more
quickly
than
it
had
come
into
being
if
the
male
survivors
in
europe
and
the
east
had
been
of
one
type
some
theory
might
be
formulated
to
account
for
their
immunity
but
so
far
as
science
can
pronounce
an
opinion
the
living
male
residue
can
only
be
explained
by
the
doctrine
of
chances
a
few
escaped
by
accident
in
the
british
isles
there
may
have
been
men
who
thus
survived
in
the
whole
of
europe
besides
there
were
less
than
a
thousand
it
seems
probable
that
even
before
scotland
was
attacked
the
climax
had
been
reached
by
the
time
the
plague
reached
england
the
first
faint
evidences
of
a
decline
in
virulence
may
be
marked
from
the
first
jasper
thrale
ventured
his
life
without
an
afterthought
he
was
fearless
by
nature
he
did
not
lack
those
powers
of
imagination
which
are
commonly
supposed
to
add
so
greatly
to
the
terror
of
death
he
simply
lacked
the
feeling
of
fear
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
experienced
that
sickness
of
apprehension
which
dissolves
our
fibre
into
a
quivering
jelly
as
though
the
spirit
had
already
withdrawn
from
the
trembling
inertia
of
the
flesh
perhaps
spirit
was
too
dominant
for
such
retreat
was
more
completely
master
of
its
material
than
is
the
spirit
of
the
common
man
for
the
spirit
can
not
know
bodily
fear
it
is
the
apprehensive
flesh
that
wilts
and
curdles
at
the
approach
of
danger
and
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
in
the
old
days
up
to
the
early
twentieth
century
these
rare
cases
of
fearlessness
in
individuals
were
more
often
found
among
women
than
among
men
thrale
with
his
perfectly
careless
courage
found
plenty
of
work
for
himself
in
london
during
may
and
early
june
he
acted
as
a
scavenger
and
still
went
far
afield
with
his
burial
cart
long
after
every
trace
of
living
male
humanity
had
disappeared
from
the
streets
of
london
then
one
day
at
the
end
of
june
he
realized
that
his
task
was
futile
and
it
came
to
him
that
there
was
work
awaiting
him
of
more
importance
than
this
purification
of
streets
which
might
never
again
echo
to
the
traffic
of
humanity
so
he
chose
the
best
bicycle
he
could
find
in
holborn
viaduct
stripped
a
relay
of
four
tyres
from
other
machines
and
with
these
and
a
reserve
of
food
made
into
a
somewhat
cumbrous
parcel
he
set
out
to
explore
the
new
world
he
took
the
bath
road
intending
to
make
exploration
of
the
fertile
west
country
he
had
cornish
blood
in
his
veins
and
his
ultimate
goal
was
the
county
which
had
almost
escaped
urbanization
as
he
then
visualized
the
problem
it
appeared
that
life
would
offer
greater
possibilities
in
such
places
but
before
he
reached
colnbrook
he
had
recognized
that
work
was
required
of
him
nearer
home
the
exodus
was
then
in
progress
he
came
through
armies
of
helpless
women
and
children
flying
from
starvation
women
who
had
no
object
in
view
save
that
of
escape
to
the
country
silly
londoners
with
no
knowledge
of
how
food
was
to
be
obtained
when
their
goal
was
reached
he
did
not
stay
there
however
he
was
beginning
to
see
the
outline
of
his
plan
and
at
the
same
time
the
limitation
of
his
own
powers
he
saw
that
enough
food
could
not
be
raised
near
london
to
support
the
multitude
that
the
death
of
the
many
was
demanded
by
the
needs
of
the
few
if
any
were
to
survive
and
that
communities
must
be
formed
with
the
common
purpose
of
tilling
the
land
and
excluding
those
who
could
not
earn
their
right
to
support
in
such
a
catastrophe
as
this
charity
became
a
crime
he
intended
even
then
to
push
on
beyond
reading
but
in
maidenhead
he
met
a
woman
who
influenced
him
to
a
nearer
goal
she
stepped
into
the
road
and
held
up
her
hand
thrale
stopped
he
thought
she
was
about
to
make
the
familiar
demand
either
for
food
or
a
direction
well
he
said
curtly
where
are
you
going
she
asked
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
find
room
he
said
there
is
room
for
you
near
here
said
the
woman
if
you
work
at
what
he
asked
machinery
harvesting
machinery
agricultural
machinery
of
all
sorts
where
asked
thrale
she
dropped
her
voice
and
looked
about
her
marlow
she
said
it
it
an
eddy
off
the
main
roads
and
by
the
river
there
are
less
than
a
thousand
women
there
at
present
and
we
are
keeping
the
others
out
at
least
until
after
harvest
there
is
plenty
of
land
about
and
we
keeping
ourselves
at
present
only
we
do
want
a
man
for
the
machines
will
you
come
and
help
us
i
come
and
see
what
i
can
do
said
thrale
i
wo
promise
to
stay
are
there
any
other
men
there
he
added
after
a
hesitation
one
at
wycombe
said
the
women
he
a
butcher
but
i
understand
said
thrale
and
meanwhile
you
might
help
me
said
the
woman
i
come
over
here
with
a
horse
and
cart
to
raid
the
seedsmen
shops
if
we
leave
them
the
women
would
eat
all
the
beans
and
peas
and
things
you
know
enough
to
feed
us
for
the
winter
gone
in
a
week
and
no
one
any
the
better
is
it
awful
how
careless
we
are
she
was
a
fair
girl
with
the
figure
and
complexion
of
one
who
had
devoted
considerable
attention
to
outdoor
sports
she
was
wearing
a
man
norfolk
jacket
men
clothing
was
so
plentiful
and
a
skirt
that
barely
reached
her
knees
and
did
not
entirely
hide
cloth
knickerbockers
which
might
also
have
been
adapted
from
a
garment
below
the
knickerbockers
she
displayed
thick
stockings
and
sandals
her
splendid
fair
hair
furnished
sufficient
protection
for
her
head
and
she
had
dressed
a
pillow
of
it
into
the
nape
of
her
neck
as
a
shield
for
the
sun
thrale
looked
at
her
with
a
frank
curiosity
as
they
made
their
way
up
the
town
to
a
seedsman
shop
she
had
left
the
horse
and
cart
there
she
explained
while
she
explored
other
streets
of
the
town
who
are
you
he
asked
eileen
of
marlow
she
said
there
does
seem
to
be
another
eileen
there
so
one
name
enough
is
that
how
your
community
feel
about
it
he
asked
she
smiled
we
beginning
she
said
he
pondered
that
for
a
time
and
then
asked
who
were
you
does
it
matter
was
the
answer
not
in
the
least
said
thrale
never
did
much
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
i
have
a
memory
of
having
seen
your
photographs
in
the
illustrated
papers
i
was
wondering
whether
you
had
been
actress
peeress
scandal
or
perhaps
all
three
she
laughed
i
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
late
duke
of
hertford
she
said
the
lady
eileen
ferrar
citizen
oh
was
that
it
replied
thrale
carelessly
where
this
shop
of
yours
the
loot
was
heavier
than
eileen
had
anticipated
the
shop
had
been
ransacked
but
they
found
an
untouched
store
containing
such
valuables
as
beans
potatoes
and
a
few
small
sacks
of
turnip
seed
at
the
bottom
of
a
yard
when
these
had
been
placed
in
the
cart
they
decided
that
the
load
was
sufficient
for
one
horse
they
took
the
longer
road
to
marlow
through
bourne
end
to
avoid
the
hill
eileen
walked
at
the
horse
head
with
thrale
beside
her
wheeling
his
bicycle
and
during
those
two
hours
he
learnt
much
of
the
little
community
which
he
proposed
to
serve
for
a
time
it
seemed
that
in
marlow
and
the
same
thing
must
have
happened
in
a
hundred
other
small
towns
throughout
the
country
a
few
women
had
taken
control
of
the
community
these
women
were
of
all
classes
and
the
committee
included
an
earl
widow
a
national
schoolmistress
a
small
and
an
unmarried
woman
of
property
living
half
a
mile
out
of
the
town
these
women
had
worked
together
in
an
eminently
practical
way
at
first
to
relieve
distress
and
then
to
plan
the
future
they
had
wasted
little
time
in
discussions
among
themselves
none
of
them
had
the
parliamentary
sense
of
the
uses
of
debate
when
they
had
disagreed
they
had
had
plenty
of
scope
to
carry
out
varying
methods
within
their
own
spheres
of
influence
their
first
and
most
difficult
task
had
been
to
teach
the
members
of
their
community
to
work
for
the
common
good
and
that
task
was
by
no
means
perfected
as
yet
was
agreeable
enough
to
those
who
had
nothing
to
lose
but
the
women
in
temporary
possession
of
the
sources
of
food
supply
were
not
so
easily
convinced
in
many
instances
the
committee
arguments
had
been
suddenly
clenched
by
an
exposition
of
force
majeure
and
property
owners
had
discovered
to
their
amazement
that
they
had
no
remedy
but
the
head
and
leader
of
marlow
was
a
farmer
daughter
of
nineteen
a
certain
carrie
oliver
her
father
had
had
a
small
farm
in
the
chilterns
not
far
from
fingest
he
had
been
a
lazy
drunken
creature
and
from
the
time
carrie
had
left
the
national
school
she
had
practically
carried
on
the
work
of
the
farm
single
handed
she
liked
the
work
the
interest
of
it
absorbed
her
the
marlow
schoolmistress
had
remembered
her
when
the
committee
had
first
faced
the
daunting
task
of
providing
for
the
future
they
had
been
more
or
less
capable
of
organizing
a
majority
of
the
women
but
no
member
of
the
committee
knew
the
secrets
of
agriculture
and
and
in
all
marlow
and
the
neighbourhood
no
woman
had
been
found
who
was
capable
of
instructing
them
in
all
that
was
necessary
a
deputation
of
three
had
been
sent
to
fingest
and
had
discovered
miss
oliver
in
the
midst
of
plenty
cultivating
her
farm
in
comfort
now
that
she
had
been
relieved
of
her
father
unwelcome
presence
she
had
been
covered
with
confusion
when
requested
to
leave
her
retreat
and
take
command
of
a
town
and
the
surrounding
twenty
thousand
acres
or
so
within
reach
of
the
new
community
oh
i
ca
she
had
said
blushing
and
ducking
her
head
easy
enough
i
tell
you
if
there
anything
you
want
to
know
the
deputation
had
then
put
the
case
very
clearly
before
her
pointing
out
that
in
miss
oliver
hands
lay
the
future
of
a
thousand
lives
oh
dear
i
dunno
what
can
i
do
carrie
had
said
and
when
the
deputation
had
urged
that
she
should
return
with
them
and
take
charge
forthwith
she
had
replied
that
that
was
quite
impossible
that
there
were
the
cows
to
milk
the
calves
pigs
and
chickens
to
feed
and
goodness
knew
how
many
other
necessary
things
to
be
done
before
sunset
the
deputation
had
said
that
cows
calves
horses
sheep
pigs
and
chickens
might
and
should
be
transferred
forthwith
to
the
neighbourhood
of
marlow
it
had
taken
three
days
to
convince
her
eileen
said
and
added
but
she
splendid
now
it
wonderful
what
a
lot
she
knows
and
she
rides
about
on
a
horse
everywhere
and
sees
to
everything
the
difficulty
is
to
stop
her
getting
down
and
doing
the
work
herself
thrale
understood
that
exceptional
male
as
he
was
his
position
in
marlow
would
be
subordinate
to
that
of
miss
oliver
does
she
understand
agricultural
machinery
he
asked
oh
yes
returned
eileen
but
she
has
time
you
see
to
attend
to
all
that
and
it
so
jolly
difficult
to
learn
i
been
doing
a
bit
i
better
at
it
than
most
of
but
when
i
saw
you
it
struck
me
how
ripping
it
would
be
if
you
come
and
take
over
that
side
men
are
so
jolly
good
at
machinery
we
should
miss
them
much
if
it
were
for
that
after
a
marked
preliminary
hesitation
the
committee
appointed
jasper
thrale
chief
mechanic
of
marlow
the
hesitation
was
understandable
their
only
experience
of
the
ways
of
men
in
this
altered
civilization
had
been
drawn
from
observations
of
mr
evans
at
wycombe
his
manner
of
life
appeared
representative
of
what
they
might
expect
nevertheless
they
did
not
openly
condemn
him
although
he
proved
an
immediate
source
of
trouble
even
to
these
organizers
in
marlow
the
youth
of
the
place
was
apt
to
wander
over
the
hill
in
the
evenings
just
for
fun
they
said
they
went
in
twos
and
threes
and
occasionally
one
of
them
stayed
behind
these
evening
walks
interfered
with
work
later
on
i
should
mind
so
much
lady
durham
had
said
commenting
on
the
loss
of
a
young
and
active
worker
but
there
is
so
much
to
do
just
now
her
comment
showed
that
even
then
the
situation
was
being
accepted
and
that
many
women
were
prepared
to
adapt
their
old
opinions
to
new
conditions
it
also
showed
why
the
committee
hesitated
to
accept
thrale
services
thrale
understood
their
difficulty
and
went
straight
to
the
point
you
are
afraid
that
the
young
women
will
be
wasting
time
running
after
me
he
said
set
your
minds
at
rest
that
wo
last
and
if
you
give
me
pupils
for
my
machinery
i
should
prefer
women
over
forty
in
any
case
i
believe
i
shall
find
them
more
capable
he
was
right
in
one
way
when
the
excitement
of
his
coming
had
subsided
he
was
not
the
cause
of
much
wasted
time
he
adopted
a
manner
with
the
younger
women
which
did
not
encourage
advances
he
was
in
fact
quite
brutally
frank
when
the
young
women
devised
all
kinds
of
impossible
excuses
to
linger
in
his
vicinity
he
sent
them
away
with
hot
indignant
faces
among
those
who
sought
their
sterile
amusements
in
wycombe
it
became
the
fashion
openly
to
express
hatred
and
contempt
for
that
engine
fellow
it
was
agreed
that
he
was
a
proper
man
another
section
however
talked
scandal
and
hinted
that
eileen
was
the
cause
of
thrale
pretended
misogyny
the
committee
found
their
work
more
complicated
in
some
respects
after
thrale
coming
thrale
himself
was
supremely
indifferent
to
any
scandal
or
expression
of
hatred
he
had
his
hands
full
his
hours
of
work
were
only
limited
by
daylight
and
six
hours
sleep
was
all
he
asked
for
or
desired
after
a
very
brief
introduction
to
the
intricacies
of
reaper
and
rake
at
the
hands
of
miss
oliver
her
father
had
never
been
able
to
afford
a
binder
but
the
days
of
were
still
far
ahead
he
set
himself
to
learn
the
mysteries
of
all
the
agricultural
machinery
in
the
neighbourhood
traction
engines
steam
ploughs
and
thrashing
machines
and
to
pass
on
the
knowledge
he
gained
to
his
pupils
he
found
them
stupid
at
first
but
they
were
patient
and
willing
for
the
most
part
then
handicapped
by
the
lack
of
coal
he
rode
over
to
bourne
end
and
discovered
two
locomotives
one
of
them
was
standing
on
the
line
a
mile
out
of
the
station
with
a
full
complement
of
coaches
attached
the
other
was
an
unencumbered
goods
engine
in
a
siding
he
chose
the
latter
for
his
first
experiment
and
succeeded
in
driving
it
back
to
marlow
it
groaned
and
screamed
in
a
way
that
indicated
serious
organic
trouble
but
after
he
had
overhauled
it
it
proved
capable
of
taking
him
to
maidenhead
where
he
found
a
sound
engine
in
a
shed
after
that
he
devoted
three
days
to
getting
a
clear
line
to
paddington
a
tedious
process
which
involved
endless
descents
from
the
cab
and
mountings
into
signal
boxes
experiments
with
levers
and
the
occasional
necessity
for
pushing
whole
trains
out
of
his
path
into
some
siding
but
at
last
he
returned
with
magnificent
loot
of
coal
from
the
almost
untouched
london
yards
beyond
ealing
london
was
still
the
storehouse
of
certain
valuable
commodities
his
passage
through
the
surrounding
country
was
hailed
with
cries
of
amazement
and
jubilant
acclamation
the
first
railway
surely
excited
less
astonishment
than
did
thrale
on
his
solitary
engine
doubtless
the
unfortunate
women
who
saw
him
pass
believed
that
the
gods
of
machinery
had
returned
once
more
to
bring
relief
from
all
the
burden
of
misery
and
unfamiliar
work
and
once
the
points
were
set
and
the
way
open
to
london
by
rail
he
could
go
and
return
with
tools
and
many
other
necessaries
that
had
offered
no
temptation
to
the
starving
multitude
who
had
fled
from
the
town
marlow
was
greatly
blessed
among
the
communities
in
those
days
the
harvest
was
early
that
year
and
miss
oliver
decided
to
cut
certain
fields
of
barley
at
the
end
of
july
thrale
energies
were
then
diverted
to
the
superintendence
of
the
reapers
and
binders
and
he
rode
from
field
to
field
overlooking
the
work
of
his
pupils
or
spending
furious
hours
in
struggle
with
some
refractory
mechanism
one
saturday
an
hour
or
two
after
midday
he
was
returning
from
some
such
struggle
when
he
saw
a
strange
procession
coming
down
that
long
hill
from
handy
cross
which
some
pious
women
regarded
as
the
road
to
hell
casual
immigration
had
almost
ceased
by
that
time
but
the
sight
indicated
the
necessity
for
immediate
action
the
immigration
laws
of
marlow
though
not
coded
as
yet
were
strict
and
only
bona
fide
workers
were
admitted
and
even
those
were
critically
examined
thrale
shouted
to
attract
attention
and
the
procession
stopped
when
he
came
through
the
gate
on
to
the
road
he
was
accosted
by
name
oh
mr
thrale
fancy
finding
you
said
the
young
woman
at
the
pole
of
the
truck
the
meeting
of
livingstone
and
stanley
was
far
less
amazing
an
old
woman
perched
on
the
truck
and
partly
sheltered
by
the
remains
of
an
umbrella
regarded
his
appearance
with
some
show
of
displeasure
by
rights
should
written
to
me
in
the
first
place
she
muttered
mother
got
a
touch
of
the
sun
explained
blanche
hurriedly
thrale
had
not
yet
spoken
he
was
considering
the
problem
of
whether
he
owed
any
duty
to
these
wanderers
which
could
override
his
duty
to
marlow
where
have
you
come
from
he
asked
blanche
and
millie
explained
volubly
by
turns
and
together
you
see
we
do
let
anyone
stay
here
said
thrale
blanche
eyebrows
went
up
and
she
waved
her
too
exuberant
sister
aside
we
willing
to
work
she
said
and
your
mother
queried
thrale
and
this
other
woman
ach
i
work
too
put
in
mrs
isaacson
i
have
learnt
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
farm
i
milk
and
feed
chickens
and
everything
you
have
to
come
before
the
committee
said
thrale
anywhere
out
of
the
sun
replied
blanche
and
somewhere
where
we
can
put
mother
she
very
bad
i
afraid
you
can
stay
anyway
returned
thrale
millie
made
a
face
at
him
behind
his
back
and
whispered
to
mrs
isaacson
who
pursed
her
mouth
well
you
do
seem
more
civilized
here
remarked
blanche
as
the
procession
restarted
towards
marlow
thrale
with
something
of
the
air
of
a
policeman
was
walking
by
the
side
of
the
pole
you
come
at
a
good
time
was
his
only
comment
millie
had
another
shock
before
they
reached
the
town
she
saw
what
she
thought
was
a
second
man
on
horseback
this
time
coming
towards
them
marlow
she
thought
was
evidently
a
place
to
live
in
but
the
figure
was
only
that
of
miss
oliver
in
corduroy
trousers
riding
astride
fate
had
dropped
the
goslings
into
buckinghamshire
to
fulfil
their
destiny
they
had
been
led
to
marlow
by
a
casual
direction
here
and
there
after
the
first
propulsion
of
blanche
instinct
had
sent
them
into
the
country
beyond
harrow
and
fate
doubtless
with
some
incomprehensible
purpose
of
its
own
in
view
had
quietly
decided
that
in
marlow
they
were
to
stay
they
had
been
dropped
at
a
season
when
for
the
first
time
in
the
long
three
months
history
of
the
community
there
was
a
shortage
of
labour
and
blanche
and
millie
browned
by
exposure
and
generally
improved
by
their
first
six
days
of
healthy
life
were
quite
acceptable
additions
to
the
population
at
that
moment
as
for
mrs
isaacson
a
lady
of
sufficient
initiative
and
force
of
character
to
require
no
kindly
interposition
of
providence
on
her
behalf
she
arranged
her
own
future
as
an
expert
of
farm
management
and
incidentally
as
the
goslings
housemate
mrs
isaacson
was
a
burr
that
would
stick
anywhere
for
a
time
she
displayed
an
unexpected
and
highly
specialized
knowledge
of
the
management
of
farms
when
confronted
with
the
expert
miss
oliver
who
was
far
too
embarrassed
to
press
her
questions
home
the
casual
remarks
of
aunt
may
and
her
helpers
had
been
retained
in
mrs
isaacson
brilliant
memory
and
she
displayed
her
knowledge
to
the
best
possible
advantage
filling
the
gaps
with
irrelevant
volubility
gesture
and
histrionic
struggles
with
the
english
language
which
proved
suddenly
inadequate
to
the
expression
of
these
recondities
that
the
german
would
have
so
aptly
expressed
it
was
inferred
that
in
her
native
bavaria
mrs
isaacson
had
farmed
in
the
grand
style
only
mrs
gosling
useless
and
ineligible
remained
for
consideration
and
she
for
once
took
a
firm
line
of
her
own
and
defied
the
committee
marlow
generally
and
the
negligible
remainder
of
the
cosmos
to
alter
her
determination
the
home
at
which
they
had
finally
arrived
did
not
suit
her
the
tiny
cottage
of
three
rooms
in
the
little
street
that
runs
down
to
the
town
landing
stage
had
no
lace
curtains
in
the
front
window
no
suites
of
furniture
no
hall
to
save
the
discreet
caller
from
stepping
through
the
front
door
straight
into
the
single
no
accumulation
of
dustable
ornaments
not
even
a
strip
of
carpet
or
linoleum
to
cover
the
nakedness
of
a
bricked
floor
it
was
not
civilized
it
was
not
decent
according
to
the
refined
standards
of
wisteria
grove
it
was
an
impossible
place
for
any
respectable
woman
to
live
in
and
mrs
gosling
with
unexpected
force
of
character
chose
the
obvious
alternative
she
did
not
however
make
any
announcement
of
her
determination
she
was
wrapped
in
a
speculative
depression
that
found
no
relief
in
words
she
had
been
so
ordered
hoisted
dragged
and
bumped
through
the
detested
country
during
the
past
six
days
that
all
show
of
authority
had
been
taken
from
her
it
may
be
that
deep
in
her
own
mind
she
cherished
a
sullen
and
enduring
resentment
against
her
daughters
and
had
vowed
to
take
the
last
and
unanswerable
revenge
of
which
humanity
is
capable
but
outwardly
she
preserved
that
air
of
incomprehension
which
had
marked
her
during
the
last
stages
of
their
journey
and
committed
herself
to
no
statement
of
the
enormous
plan
which
must
have
been
forming
in
her
mind
when
they
took
her
into
the
small
room
and
deposited
her
temporarily
on
a
chair
while
they
unpacked
what
remained
to
them
in
the
accursed
trolly
mrs
gosling
took
one
brief
but
comprehensive
survey
of
her
naked
surroundings
she
a
bit
touched
is
she
whispered
millie
to
her
sister
do
you
think
she
understands
where
we
are
or
what
we
doing
blanche
shook
her
head
i
expect
she
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
she
ventured
it
the
sun
the
two
girls
stirred
to
a
new
outlook
on
life
by
the
extraordinary
experiences
of
the
past
months
were
on
the
threshold
of
diverse
adventures
after
the
toil
and
anxiety
of
their
tramp
through
inhospitable
country
and
the
hazard
of
the
open
air
this
reception
into
a
community
and
settlement
into
a
permanent
shelter
afforded
a
relief
which
was
too
unexpected
to
be
qualified
as
yet
by
criticism
or
any
comparison
with
past
glories
they
were
young
and
plastic
and
to
each
of
them
the
future
seemed
to
hold
some
promise
to
them
the
silence
and
immobility
of
their
mother
could
only
be
evidence
of
impaired
faculties
we
must
get
her
to
bed
said
blanche
even
when
mrs
gosling
asked
with
perfect
relevance
are
we
going
to
stop
blanche
they
humoured
her
with
evasive
replies
well
for
a
day
or
two
perhaps
and
look
here
do
you
worry
about
that
we
going
to
put
you
to
bed
her
head
dropped
again
and
she
fell
back
into
her
moody
silence
doubtless
she
meditated
on
the
many
wrongs
her
daughters
had
done
her
and
wondered
why
she
should
have
been
brought
out
to
die
in
this
wilderness
during
the
nine
days
that
elapsed
before
her
plan
matured
she
made
no
further
comment
on
her
surroundings
she
lay
in
the
upstairs
room
sleeping
little
with
no
desire
ever
again
to
face
the
terror
of
a
world
which
demanded
a
new
mode
of
thought
unconsciously
she
had
adopted
blanche
phrase
everything
different
but
to
her
the
message
was
one
of
doom
she
could
not
live
in
a
different
world
and
blanche
on
her
side
was
puzzled
at
her
mother
apathy
and
said
i
ca
understand
it
yet
both
the
changed
conditions
and
mrs
gosling
unchangeable
habit
were
fundamental
things
xviii
modes
of
expression
in
marlow
that
year
harvesting
and
thrashing
were
carried
on
simultaneously
august
was
very
dry
and
the
greater
part
of
the
corn
was
never
stacked
at
all
thrale
took
his
engines
into
the
fields
and
the
shocks
were
loaded
on
to
carts
and
fed
directly
into
the
thrasher
this
method
entailed
some
disadvantages
chief
among
them
the
retarding
of
the
actual
but
on
the
whole
it
probably
economized
labour
the
scheme
would
doubtless
have
been
impracticable
in
the
days
of
small
private
ownership
but
it
worked
well
in
this
instance
favoured
as
it
was
by
the
drought
the
saving
of
labour
during
those
six
weeks
of
furious
toil
was
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
the
work
indeed
was
too
heavy
for
many
of
the
women
who
were
unable
to
stand
the
physical
strain
of
hoisting
sheaves
from
the
waggons
into
the
thrasher
and
the
sacks
of
grain
proved
so
unmanageable
that
thrale
had
to
devise
a
makeshift
hoist
for
loading
them
into
the
carts
in
marlow
at
least
machinery
was
still
triumphant
and
the
committee
sighed
their
relief
in
the
sentence
i
do
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
jasper
thrale
nevertheless
it
is
quite
certain
that
they
would
have
done
without
him
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
fortuitous
meeting
in
maidenhead
for
thrale
there
was
no
rest
possible
even
when
the
last
field
had
been
cleared
and
the
last
stack
of
straw
or
unthrashed
corn
erected
besides
the
necessity
for
some
form
of
thatching
or
failing
efficiency
in
that
direction
for
completing
the
thrashing
operations
he
had
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
immensely
difficult
problem
of
turning
the
grain
into
flour
he
knew
vaguely
that
the
grain
ought
to
be
cleaned
and
conditioned
before
grinding
and
that
the
actual
separation
of
the
constituents
of
the
berry
was
a
matter
of
importance
but
he
had
no
practical
knowledge
of
the
various
operations
and
in
this
matter
miss
oliver
was
quite
unable
to
help
him
the
mill
beside
the
lock
presented
itself
as
an
intricate
and
enormously
detailed
problem
which
must
be
solved
by
a
concentrated
effort
of
induction
the
only
person
who
appeared
to
be
of
real
assistance
to
him
was
eileen
and
she
was
apt
to
tire
and
fall
into
despair
when
the
detail
of
involved
and
often
concealed
machinery
baffled
them
for
hour
after
hour
nevertheless
thrale
solved
this
problem
also
his
first
concern
was
for
a
head
of
water
the
weirs
had
not
been
touched
since
the
beginning
of
may
and
the
river
was
very
low
but
by
there
was
enough
water
to
work
for
a
few
hours
every
day
and
despite
endless
mistakes
and
setbacks
the
mill
was
turning
out
a
sufficient
supply
of
fairly
respectable
looking
flour
thrale
had
that
wonderful
masculine
faculty
for
thus
applying
himself
to
a
mechanical
problem
and
like
his
predecessors
in
mechanical
invention
it
was
the
problem
and
not
any
promise
of
future
reward
which
interested
him
he
became
absorbed
for
the
time
in
that
problem
of
grinding
corn
grudging
the
hours
he
was
obliged
to
devote
to
other
activities
and
when
he
felt
the
throb
of
life
running
through
the
mill
saw
the
women
he
had
taught
attending
each
to
their
own
appointed
task
in
the
economy
and
felt
the
touch
of
the
fine
smooth
flour
between
his
fingers
he
needed
no
thanks
from
the
committee
nor
promise
of
independence
to
reward
him
for
his
labour
the
sight
of
this
thing
he
had
created
was
sufficient
recompense
he
loved
this
beautiful
efficient
toy
that
changed
wheat
into
flour
and
oats
into
meal
it
was
his
to
father
and
to
fight
for
the
perfect
child
of
his
ingenuity
and
toil
but
if
thrale
time
was
tremendously
occupied
the
women
found
that
they
had
more
opportunities
for
leisure
after
harvest
they
were
still
employed
in
field
and
garden
and
there
was
still
much
to
be
done
but
their
hours
were
shorter
and
the
work
seemed
light
in
contrast
with
the
heroic
labour
that
had
been
necessary
at
the
harvest
and
with
this
first
coming
of
comparative
ease
this
first
opportunity
for
reflection
since
the
terrible
plague
had
thrust
upon
them
the
necessity
for
fierce
and
unremitting
effort
to
produce
the
essentials
of
life
women
began
to
express
themselves
in
their
various
ways
aspirations
and
emotions
that
had
been
crushed
by
the
fatigues
of
physical
labour
began
to
revive
personal
inclinations
jealousies
and
resentments
became
manifest
in
the
detail
of
intercourse
old
prejudices
religious
and
social
once
more
assumed
an
aspect
of
importance
in
the
interactions
of
individuals
there
was
a
faint
stir
in
the
community
the
first
sign
of
a
trouble
which
was
steadily
to
increase
as
winter
laid
its
bond
upon
the
storehouses
of
earth
the
two
goslings
working
only
six
or
seven
hours
a
day
in
the
mill
during
the
latter
part
of
september
found
plenty
of
time
for
chatter
and
speculation
they
and
more
especially
blanche
had
shown
themselves
capable
workers
in
the
harvest
field
but
when
hands
had
been
required
in
his
mill
thrale
had
chosen
the
goslings
and
those
whom
he
considered
less
adapted
to
field
work
and
among
them
mrs
isaacson
and
a
member
of
the
committee
miss
jenkyn
the
schoolmistress
the
education
problem
was
in
abeyance
for
the
time
being
the
children
had
run
wild
for
three
months
and
been
subject
only
to
the
discipline
of
their
mothers
but
it
was
understood
that
the
children
were
to
receive
attention
when
the
winter
brought
opportunity
blanche
soon
distinguished
herself
as
a
picked
worker
in
this
sphere
her
intelligence
was
of
a
somewhat
more
masculine
quality
in
some
respects
than
that
of
the
average
woman
she
was
slower
more
detailed
more
logical
in
her
methods
and
now
that
those
male
characteristics
so
often
deplored
by
women
in
the
days
before
the
plague
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
flux
of
life
it
had
become
evident
that
they
had
been
an
essential
part
of
the
whole
if
only
a
part
masculine
characteristics
were
at
a
premium
in
marlow
that
autumn
and
as
a
natural
consequence
were
being
rated
at
an
ever
higher
value
there
was
a
tendency
among
some
women
to
become
more
male
millie
however
was
not
among
the
progressives
she
was
not
gifted
intellectually
she
had
no
swift
intuitions
such
as
eileen
had
which
enabled
her
to
comprehend
her
work
she
was
naturally
indolent
and
all
her
emotions
came
to
her
through
sensation
when
she
was
put
to
work
in
the
mill
she
was
secretly
elated
she
did
not
believe
the
stories
told
of
jasper
thrale
insensibility
to
feminine
attractions
and
if
she
believed
those
other
stories
which
coupled
his
name
with
that
of
lady
eileen
millie
was
of
opinion
that
such
an
entanglement
was
not
necessarily
final
the
first
week
of
her
association
with
thrale
in
the
work
of
the
mill
brought
disillusionment
when
she
looked
up
from
her
work
and
caught
his
eye
as
he
passed
her
he
either
stared
coldly
or
stopped
and
asked
in
a
businesslike
austere
voice
whether
she
wanted
assistance
such
intimations
should
have
been
sufficient
but
in
this
thing
at
least
millie
was
persistent
she
thought
that
he
did
not
understand
men
were
proverbially
stupid
in
these
matters
so
she
waited
for
an
opportunity
and
within
ten
days
one
was
presented
a
hesitation
in
some
of
the
machinery
she
overlooked
provided
sufficient
excuse
for
calling
the
head
engineer
she
looked
down
the
which
communicated
with
the
floor
below
and
called
hesitatingly
oh
please
mr
thrale
he
heard
her
and
looked
up
what
is
it
he
asked
something
gone
wrong
she
said
blushing
i
stopped
the
rollers
but
i
do
know
all
right
i
coming
he
returned
and
presently
joined
her
by
the
way
he
remarked
as
he
began
to
examine
the
machine
we
do
say
now
i
thought
you
learnt
that
millie
simpered
it
sounds
so
familiar
not
to
she
said
rubbish
grunted
thrale
you
can
call
me
i
suppose
now
look
here
he
continued
do
you
see
this
hopper
in
here
she
came
close
to
him
and
peered
into
the
machine
it
gets
clogged
do
you
see
said
thrale
and
when
the
meal
stutters
you
just
got
to
put
your
hand
in
and
clear
it
understand
i
think
so
hesitated
millie
she
was
leaning
against
him
and
her
body
was
trembling
with
delicious
excitement
almost
unconsciously
she
pressed
a
little
closer
thrale
suddenly
drew
back
do
you
understand
he
said
harshly
i
think
so
returned
millie
and
she
straightened
herself
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
dropped
her
eyes
blushing
very
well
said
thrale
and
here
another
piece
of
advice
for
you
if
you
want
to
stay
in
the
mill
keep
your
attention
on
your
work
you
a
man
now
for
all
intents
and
purposes
you
got
a
man
work
to
do
and
you
must
keep
your
mind
on
it
if
there
any
foolishness
you
go
out
into
the
turnip
fields
you
wo
have
another
warning
he
concluded
as
he
turned
and
left
her
beast
muttered
millie
when
she
was
alone
she
was
shaken
with
furious
anger
i
hate
you
you
silly
stuck
up
thing
she
whispered
fiercely
shaking
with
passion
oh
i
wish
you
only
knew
how
i
hate
you
i
wo
touch
your
beastly
machines
again
i
sooner
a
million
times
be
out
in
the
turnip
field
than
in
the
same
mill
with
you
you
stuck
up
beast
i
wo
work
i
wo
do
a
thing
i
i
for
a
time
she
was
hysterical
blanche
coming
down
from
the
floor
above
found
her
sister
tearing
at
her
hair
good
heavens
mill
what
up
she
asked
millie
had
passed
through
the
worst
stages
of
her
seizure
by
then
and
she
dropped
her
hands
i
dunno
she
said
it
this
beastly
mill
i
suppose
i
like
it
returned
blanche
oh
you
said
millie
full
of
scorn
for
blanche
frigidity
you
ought
to
have
been
a
man
you
ought
i
dunno
what
come
to
you
was
blanche
comment
it
was
maturity
that
had
come
to
millie
her
new
life
of
air
and
physical
exercise
had
set
the
blood
running
in
her
veins
in
the
wisteria
grove
days
she
had
had
an
anæmic
tendency
the
limited
routine
of
her
existence
and
all
the
suppressions
of
her
narrow
life
had
retarded
her
development
now
she
was
suddenly
ripe
two
months
of
sun
and
air
had
brought
superabundant
vitality
and
the
surplus
had
become
the
most
important
factor
in
her
existence
she
found
no
outlet
for
her
new
vigour
in
the
work
of
the
mill
something
within
her
was
crying
out
for
joy
she
wanted
to
find
expression
there
were
many
other
young
women
in
marlow
that
autumn
in
similar
case
and
a
rumour
was
current
among
them
that
this
was
a
favourable
time
for
crossing
the
hill
it
was
said
that
the
lord
of
wycombe
was
seeking
new
favourites
millie
heard
the
rumour
and
tossed
her
head
superciliously
let
him
come
here
i
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
she
said
he
does
come
returned
the
gossip
afeard
of
our
mr
thrale
oh
jasper
thrale
said
millie
that
fellow
from
wycombe
could
knock
his
head
off
in
no
time
the
gossip
was
doubtful
millie
was
incapable
of
formulating
a
plan
in
this
connexion
but
she
was
seized
with
a
desire
for
spending
the
still
september
evenings
in
the
open
air
and
always
something
drew
her
towards
the
hill
at
handy
cross
that
way
lay
interest
and
excitement
there
was
a
wonderful
fascination
in
going
as
far
as
the
top
of
the
descent
into
wycombe
usually
she
joined
one
or
two
other
young
women
in
these
excursions
it
was
understood
between
them
that
they
went
for
fun
and
they
would
laugh
and
scream
when
they
reached
the
dip
past
the
farm
pretend
to
push
each
other
down
the
slope
and
cry
out
suddenly
he
coming
run
but
one
afternoon
some
ten
days
after
jasper
thrale
had
threatened
her
with
the
turnip
field
millie
went
alone
she
had
left
work
early
the
rain
had
not
come
yet
and
thrale
was
becoming
anxious
with
regard
to
the
shortage
of
water
he
had
the
sluices
of
marlow
and
hedsor
weirs
closed
and
had
opened
the
sluices
of
the
weirs
above
as
far
as
hambledon
but
so
little
water
was
coming
down
that
he
decided
to
work
shorter
hours
for
the
present
blanche
had
stayed
on
at
the
mill
to
help
with
repairs
she
was
rapidly
developing
into
a
capable
engineer
so
millie
whose
only
service
was
that
of
machine
minder
found
herself
alone
and
unoccupied
every
one
else
seemed
to
be
working
her
friends
of
the
evening
excursions
were
mostly
in
the
fields
on
the
henley
side
of
the
town
millie
decided
she
would
lie
down
on
the
bed
and
go
to
sleep
for
a
bit
but
even
before
she
came
to
the
cottage
she
changed
her
mind
it
was
a
deliciously
warm
still
afternoon
almost
automatically
she
took
the
road
towards
little
marlow
a
desire
for
adventure
had
overtaken
her
why
she
argued
should
she
go
into
wycombe
there
were
plenty
of
other
women
there
she
would
be
quite
safe
she
only
wanted
to
see
what
the
place
was
like
her
consciousness
of
perfect
rectitude
lasted
until
she
reached
the
dip
beyond
handy
cross
farther
than
this
she
had
not
ventured
before
some
mystery
lay
beyond
the
turn
of
the
road
she
sat
down
in
the
grass
by
the
wayside
and
called
herself
a
fool
but
she
was
afraid
to
go
further
she
and
those
friends
of
hers
had
made
this
place
the
entrance
to
a
terrible
and
fascinating
beyond
she
remembered
how
they
had
feared
to
stay
there
in
the
failing
light
daring
each
other
to
remain
there
alone
after
sunset
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
she
said
to
herself
and
yet
she
was
afraid
she
was
hot
with
her
long
climb
and
the
place
was
quite
deserted
she
decided
to
take
down
her
hair
to
cool
herself
curiously
she
looked
upon
this
simple
act
as
deliciously
daring
and
in
some
way
wicked
she
cast
glances
at
the
green
girt
shadows
of
the
descending
road
as
she
shook
out
the
masses
of
her
hair
if
anyone
should
come
she
thought
if
he
should
come
she
giggled
nervously
and
shivered
but
as
time
passed
and
no
one
came
she
began
to
lose
her
fear
and
presently
she
lay
full
length
on
the
grass
and
stared
up
into
the
pale
blue
dome
of
the
sky
until
her
eyes
ached
and
she
had
to
close
them
the
deep
hush
of
the
still
afternoon
enveloped
her
in
a
great
calm
for
a
time
she
slept
peacefully
and
then
she
dreamed
that
she
was
rushing
through
the
air
and
that
some
one
chased
her
she
wanted
desperately
to
be
captured
but
it
was
ordained
that
she
must
fly
and
she
flew
incredibly
fast
she
flew
through
the
sunlight
into
darkness
and
awoke
to
find
that
some
one
was
standing
between
her
and
the
sun
she
lay
still
paralysed
with
terror
she
bitterly
regretted
her
coming
she
would
have
given
ten
years
of
life
to
be
safe
home
in
marlow
now
where
i
seen
you
before
asked
sam
evans
it
was
nearly
dark
when
blanche
accosted
a
knot
of
women
in
the
high
street
with
a
question
as
to
whether
they
had
seen
anything
of
her
sister
one
of
the
women
laughed
sneeringly
ah
she
went
over
the
hill
this
afternoon
she
said
we
were
in
the
fields
that
side
and
saw
her
go
blanche
face
burned
she
has
i
know
she
has
she
blurted
out
she
is
one
of
that
sort
the
woman
laughed
again
she
one
of
the
lucky
ones
another
woman
remarked
you
can
expect
her
back
in
a
week
or
two
time
on
the
same
evening
that
millie
crossed
the
hill
lady
eileen
ferrar
encountered
the
spirit
of
passion
in
another
shape
the
thought
of
a
lonely
bathe
tempted
her
and
she
crossed
the
river
made
her
way
through
deserted
bisham
and
back
to
the
stream
along
a
narrow
overhung
lane
beyond
bisham
abbey
the
sun
had
set
but
when
she
came
out
from
the
trees
there
was
light
in
the
sky
and
on
the
water
overhead
a
few
wisps
of
cirrus
sailing
in
the
far
heights
of
air
still
caught
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
eileen
paused
on
the
bank
rejoicing
in
the
glow
of
colour
about
her
but
as
she
gazed
the
little
fleet
of
clouds
were
engulfed
in
the
great
and
the
delicate
crisp
were
transfigured
into
flat
stipples
of
steel
grey
a
slight
chill
had
come
into
the
air
but
the
water
was
deliciously
soft
and
warm
eileen
swam
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
towards
the
gloom
of
shadows
that
obscured
the
course
of
the
river
the
was
fading
now
and
though
the
surface
of
the
water
seemed
to
catch
some
reflection
of
light
from
an
unknown
source
the
near
distance
loomed
dark
and
mysterious
she
trod
water
for
a
few
moments
but
could
not
decide
whether
the
river
turned
to
right
or
left
to
all
appearances
it
terminated
abruptly
fifty
yards
ahead
a
new
sound
was
forcing
itself
upon
her
attention
a
low
steady
booming
she
stopped
swimming
and
keeping
herself
afloat
by
slow
silent
movements
of
hands
and
feet
under
water
she
listened
attentively
the
dull
boom
seemed
changed
into
a
low
ceaseless
moan
she
remembered
then
the
recently
opened
sluices
of
temple
weir
but
quite
suddenly
she
was
aware
of
fear
she
thought
she
saw
a
movement
among
the
reeds
by
the
bank
she
thought
she
heard
laughter
and
the
thin
pipe
of
a
flute
were
the
old
gods
coming
back
to
witness
the
death
of
man
as
they
had
witnessed
his
birth
now
that
machinery
and
civilization
were
being
into
the
from
which
they
had
been
wrung
by
the
force
of
man
devilish
and
alien
intelligence
were
the
old
things
returning
for
one
mad
revel
before
the
creatures
of
their
sport
disappeared
for
ever
these
representatives
of
a
species
which
had
failed
to
hold
its
own
in
the
struggle
for
existence
night
was
coming
up
like
a
shadow
and
in
the
east
a
red
enormous
moon
was
rising
coming
not
to
dissipate
but
to
enhance
the
mysteries
of
the
dark
coming
to
countenance
the
wild
and
blind
the
eyes
of
man
eileen
almost
motionless
was
floating
down
with
the
drift
of
the
sluggish
stream
she
was
afraid
to
intrude
upon
the
natural
sounds
of
the
night
the
stealthy
trickle
of
the
river
and
the
furtive
rustle
of
secret
movement
whose
origin
she
could
not
guess
and
again
she
thought
that
she
heard
the
trembling
reed
of
a
distant
flute
she
touched
bottom
near
her
and
waded
out
of
the
river
crouching
afraid
even
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
trees
to
exhibit
the
white
column
of
her
slim
body
she
dried
and
dressed
hastily
and
when
she
felt
again
the
touch
of
her
familiar
clothes
about
her
she
knew
that
she
was
safe
from
the
wiles
of
nymph
or
satyr
she
had
come
out
of
the
that
interposes
between
man
and
nature
her
clothes
made
her
invisible
to
the
and
hid
them
from
her
knowledge
but
she
was
still
trembling
and
afraid
the
flesh
had
terrors
great
as
those
of
the
spirit
a
little
uncertain
wind
was
coming
out
of
the
and
the
trees
were
stirred
now
and
again
into
hushed
whisperings
a
dead
leaf
brushed
her
face
in
falling
and
she
started
back
thrusting
at
an
imaginary
enemy
with
nervously
agitated
hands
the
thought
of
her
remoteness
from
life
terrified
her
she
was
alone
face
to
face
with
implacable
brutal
nature
man
the
boastful
full
of
foolish
pride
was
vanishing
from
the
earth
he
had
been
an
alien
ever
out
of
place
defiling
and
corrupting
the
order
of
growth
now
he
was
beaten
and
a
fugitive
all
around
her
the
representative
of
this
vile
destructive
species
was
the
slow
persistent
hatred
of
the
earth
which
longed
to
be
at
peace
again
there
was
no
god
favourable
to
man
now
that
he
was
dying
the
gods
of
man
creation
would
perish
with
him
only
a
few
women
were
left
to
realize
that
they
were
strangers
in
the
world
of
nature
which
hated
them
the
world
was
not
theirs
had
never
been
theirs
they
were
only
some
horrible
unnatural
fungus
that
had
disfigured
the
earth
for
a
time
she
moved
cautiously
and
slowly
under
the
darkness
of
the
trees
and
even
when
she
came
back
to
the
road
she
could
not
shake
off
her
fear
on
her
right
she
could
see
the
black
cliff
of
the
woods
transfigured
by
the
light
of
the
moon
in
the
day
she
knew
them
for
woods
now
they
were
strange
and
threatening
they
menaced
her
with
invasion
she
knew
that
they
would
march
down
from
the
hills
and
swarm
across
the
valley
in
a
hundred
two
hundred
years
marlow
would
be
a
few
heaps
of
brick
and
stone
lost
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
ashamed
of
her
race
she
hurried
on
stealthily
towards
the
bridge
but
before
she
reached
it
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
firm
defiant
step
coming
towards
her
she
paused
and
listened
and
her
fear
fell
from
her
in
the
old
days
she
would
have
feared
man
more
than
nature
feared
robbery
or
assault
but
now
man
was
united
in
a
common
cause
the
sound
of
humanity
was
the
sound
of
a
friend
hullo
she
called
and
the
voice
of
jasper
thrale
answered
hullo
who
that
he
said
me
eileen
she
replied
i
been
for
a
bathe
he
paused
opposite
her
and
they
looked
at
one
another
jolly
night
he
remarked
i
seen
the
great
god
pan
said
eileen
those
sailors
in
the
ionian
sea
were
misinformed
he
not
dead
why
should
pan
die
and
dionysus
live
returned
thrale
i
hear
that
dionysus
has
claimed
one
of
our
hands
by
the
way
millie
yes
are
you
angry
yes
not
with
millie
if
you
saw
pan
why
should
she
see
dionysus
no
i
angry
with
the
jenkyn
woman
she
saying
that
we
ought
not
to
have
millie
back
if
she
wants
to
come
how
silly
commented
eileen
oh
if
that
were
all
replied
thrale
the
real
trouble
is
that
the
jenkyn
woman
is
proselytizing
she
wants
to
revive
church
services
and
sunday
observances
we
going
to
have
a
split
before
the
over
and
all
the
old
misunderstandings
and
antagonisms
back
again
why
of
course
we
are
returned
eileen
after
a
pause
we
are
going
to
divide
into
those
that
are
afraid
and
those
that
are
fear
that
got
hold
of
us
now
we
time
to
think
it
all
about
us
i
seen
it
and
millie
has
seen
it
and
clara
jenkyn
and
all
those
who
are
going
with
her
have
seen
it
and
we
all
got
to
find
our
own
way
out
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
and
what
about
you
have
you
seen
it
yes
for
the
first
time
within
the
last
ten
minutes
said
thrale
the
moon
was
above
the
trees
now
and
she
could
see
his
face
clearly
have
you
she
asked
i
ca
picture
it
it
ca
be
pan
or
dionysus
or
fear
of
the
earth
or
of
humanity
no
and
it
ca
be
the
most
terrible
of
all
the
fear
of
an
idea
what
are
you
afraid
of
i
afraid
of
you
said
thrale
and
he
turned
away
quickly
and
hurried
on
in
the
direction
of
the
river
i
did
see
pan
affirmed
eileen
as
she
returned
happy
and
unafraid
towards
marlow
that
mood
of
the
night
had
suggested
to
eileen
the
idea
of
a
single
cause
which
seemed
sufficient
to
account
for
the
revivalist
tendencies
of
miss
jenkyn
and
certain
other
women
in
marlow
fear
was
presented
as
a
simple
explanation
and
eileen
like
many
other
philosophers
who
had
preceded
her
was
too
eager
for
the
simple
and
inclusive
explanation
at
first
the
revivalist
tendency
was
feeble
and
circumscribed
twenty
or
thirty
women
met
in
the
schoolroom
and
talked
and
prayed
by
the
light
of
a
single
tenderly
nursed
the
absence
of
any
minister
kept
them
back
at
first
the
less
earnest
needed
some
concrete
embodiment
of
religion
in
the
form
of
a
black
coat
and
white
tie
but
when
the
rain
came
in
early
october
came
and
persisted
when
the
beeches
instead
of
flaring
into
scarlet
grew
sodden
and
dead
when
the
threat
of
flood
grew
even
more
imminent
and
the
distraction
of
physical
toil
almost
ceased
this
little
nucleus
of
women
was
joined
by
many
new
recruits
and
their
comparatively
harmless
prostrations
lamentations
and
worshippings
of
the
abstract
developed
into
an
attempt
to
enforce
a
moral
law
upon
the
community
millie
gosling
returning
to
marlow
in
gave
the
religionists
splendid
opportunity
for
a
first
demonstration
millie
returned
with
a
bold
face
and
a
shrinking
heart
she
had
fled
from
wycombe
because
she
could
not
meet
the
taunts
of
the
women
who
had
so
lately
envied
her
as
she
rode
prime
favourite
for
a
time
in
the
dionysian
landau
a
great
loneliness
had
come
over
her
after
she
was
dethroned
she
needed
sympathy
and
she
hoped
that
blanche
might
be
made
to
understand
millie
came
back
from
over
the
hill
prepared
with
a
long
tale
of
excuses
she
found
her
sister
perfectly
complacent
blanche
was
a
fervent
disciple
of
jasper
thrale
and
machinery
and
thrale
had
anticipated
millie
return
and
in
some
ways
prepared
for
it
at
odd
moments
he
had
preached
the
new
gospel
the
tenets
of
which
blanche
had
begun
to
formulate
for
herself
it
no
good
going
back
to
the
old
morality
for
a
precedent
had
been
the
essential
argument
used
by
thrale
we
have
to
face
new
conditions
if
a
man
is
only
to
have
one
wife
now
the
race
will
decline
probably
perish
it
is
a
woman
duty
to
bear
children
eileen
blanche
and
a
few
other
young
women
had
wondered
that
he
made
no
application
of
the
argument
to
his
own
case
but
his
opinion
carried
more
weight
by
reason
of
his
continence
even
miss
jenkyn
could
not
urge
that
his
opinion
was
framed
to
defend
his
own
mode
of
life
and
failing
that
casuistical
support
she
had
to
fall
back
on
the
second
alternative
of
her
kind
namely
to
assert
that
this
preacher
of
antagonistic
opinions
was
either
the
devil
in
person
or
possessed
by
him
a
line
of
defence
which
took
longer
to
establish
than
the
simple
accusation
of
expediency
so
millie
returning
one
wet
october
afternoon
found
that
no
excuses
were
required
of
her
blanche
welcomed
her
and
asked
no
questions
and
jasper
thrale
and
eileen
came
to
the
little
cottage
in
st
peter
street
at
sunset
and
treated
the
prodigal
millie
with
a
new
and
altogether
delightful
friendliness
it
was
understood
that
she
would
return
at
once
to
her
work
in
the
mill
but
in
the
opposite
another
reception
was
being
prepared
for
her
the
more
advanced
of
the
jenkynites
were
for
taking
immediate
action
prayer
worship
and
the
acknowledgment
of
personal
sin
fell
into
the
background
that
evening
millie
appeared
not
as
a
brand
to
be
saved
from
the
burning
but
as
an
abandoned
and
evil
creature
who
must
be
thrust
out
of
the
community
if
any
member
of
it
was
to
save
her
soul
alive
every
one
of
these
furious
religionists
could
stand
up
and
declare
that
she
was
innocent
of
the
commission
of
this
particular
sin
of
millie
and
every
one
was
willing
and
anxious
to
cast
the
first
stone
the
meeting
simmered
and
at
last
boiled
over
into
st
peter
street
a
band
of
more
than
a
dozen
rigidly
virtuous
and
ecstatically
christian
women
beat
at
the
door
of
the
goslings
cottage
they
had
come
to
denounce
sin
and
thrust
the
sinner
out
of
the
community
with
physical
violence
each
of
them
in
her
own
heart
thought
of
herself
as
the
bride
of
christ
the
door
was
opened
to
them
by
jasper
thrale
we
have
come
to
cast
out
the
evil
one
cried
miss
jenkyn
in
a
high
emotional
voice
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
thrale
she
shall
be
cast
forth
from
our
midst
shrilled
miss
jenkyn
and
her
supporters
raised
a
horrible
screaming
cry
of
agreement
cast
her
forth
they
cried
finding
full
justification
for
their
high
pitch
of
emotion
in
the
use
of
biblical
phrase
cast
forth
your
grandmother
replied
thrale
calmly
get
back
to
your
homes
and
do
be
foolish
he
is
possessed
of
the
devil
chanted
miss
jenkyn
the
lord
has
called
upon
us
to
vindicate
his
honour
and
glory
this
man
too
must
not
be
suffered
to
dwell
in
the
congregation
down
with
him
down
with
him
assented
the
little
crowd
now
so
exalted
with
the
glory
of
their
common
purpose
that
they
were
ready
for
martyrdom
miss
jenkyn
was
an
undersized
withered
little
spinster
of
and
physically
impotent
but
drunk
with
the
fervour
of
her
emotion
and
encouraged
by
the
sympathy
of
her
followers
and
the
fury
of
her
own
voice
she
flung
herself
fiercely
upon
the
calm
figure
of
jasper
thrale
her
thwarted
had
found
an
outlet
she
desired
the
blood
of
millie
gosling
and
jasper
thrale
with
the
same
intensity
that
women
had
once
desired
a
useless
vote
jasper
thrale
put
out
a
careless
hand
and
pushed
her
back
into
the
arms
of
the
women
behind
her
but
she
was
up
again
instantly
and
backed
by
the
crowd
who
encouraging
themselves
by
shrill
screams
of
cast
them
forth
were
now
thrusting
forward
into
the
narrow
doorway
she
renewed
the
assault
with
all
the
fierce
energy
of
a
struggling
kitten
i
shall
lose
my
temper
in
a
minute
said
thrale
as
he
took
a
step
forward
and
bracing
himself
against
the
door
frame
drove
the
women
back
with
vigorous
thrusts
of
his
powerful
arms
to
lose
his
temper
indeed
seemed
the
only
way
of
escape
to
give
way
to
berserk
rage
and
so
to
injure
these
muscularly
feeble
creatures
that
they
would
be
unable
to
continue
the
struggle
but
the
babble
of
screaming
voices
was
bringing
other
helpers
to
his
aid
chief
among
them
lady
durham
and
her
cold
clear
voice
fell
on
the
hysterical
jenkynites
like
a
douche
of
cold
water
clara
jenkyn
what
are
you
doing
asked
elsie
durham
millie
gosling
must
be
cast
forth
wavered
the
little
dishevelled
woman
but
this
time
there
was
no
reponse
from
her
disciples
that
is
a
question
for
the
committee
replied
elsie
durham
now
please
go
to
your
homes
all
of
you
miss
jenkyn
tried
to
explain
elsie
durham
walked
into
the
cottage
and
shut
the
door
inside
eileen
and
blanche
were
trying
to
reassure
the
trembling
millie
outside
the
jenkynites
were
suffering
a
more
brutal
martyrdom
than
that
they
had
sought
the
tongues
of
the
new
arrivals
the
more
physically
vigorous
members
of
the
community
were
making
sport
of
these
brides
of
christ
but
the
women
of
marlow
were
to
learn
afresh
the
old
lesson
that
religious
enthusiasm
is
not
to
be
killed
by
ridicule
or
oppression
jasper
thrale
understood
and
appreciated
that
fact
but
the
policy
he
suggested
could
not
be
approved
by
the
committee
this
emotion
is
a
fundamental
thing
he
said
to
lady
durham
and
history
will
show
you
that
persecution
will
intensify
it
to
the
point
of
martyrdom
there
is
only
one
way
to
combat
it
give
it
room
let
them
do
as
they
will
the
heat
of
the
fire
is
too
fierce
for
you
to
damp
it
down
you
only
supply
more
fuel
fan
it
throw
it
open
to
the
air
and
it
will
burn
itself
harmlessly
out
elsie
durham
shrugged
her
shoulders
that
all
very
well
she
said
i
believe
it
perfectly
true
but
they
make
you
the
bone
of
contention
if
it
were
only
millie
gosling
well
she
might
go
we
could
find
a
place
for
her
at
fingest
perhaps
but
we
ca
spare
you
i
do
know
why
not
returned
thrale
i
never
intended
to
stay
indefinitely
you
can
carry
on
now
without
me
and
i
can
fulfil
my
original
intention
and
push
on
into
the
west
my
dear
man
we
ca
and
we
wo
said
elsie
durham
you
are
indispensable
no
one
is
indispensable
replied
thrale
bother
your
metaphysics
jasper
was
the
answer
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
go
is
the
majority
of
marlow
not
only
the
committee
we
fight
the
fanatics
somehow
the
majority
referred
to
by
elsie
durham
was
fairly
compact
in
relation
to
this
issue
of
retaining
jasper
thrale
and
included
the
two
greater
of
the
three
recognizable
parties
in
the
community
of
these
three
the
greatest
was
the
moderate
party
made
up
of
episcopalians
nonconformists
and
a
few
roman
catholics
who
found
relief
for
their
emotion
one
day
in
seven
either
in
the
town
hall
or
marlow
church
in
which
places
services
and
meetings
were
held
the
former
by
certain
approved
individuals
notably
elsie
durham
and
the
widow
of
the
late
rector
of
marlow
the
second
party
in
order
of
size
included
all
those
who
either
denied
the
divine
revelation
or
were
careless
of
all
religious
matters
the
third
party
the
jenkynites
as
they
were
dubbed
by
their
opponents
had
drawn
their
numbers
from
every
old
denomination
the
jenkynites
were
differentiated
from
the
other
two
parties
by
certain
physical
differences
for
instance
the
jenkynites
numbered
few
members
under
the
age
of
very
few
of
them
were
fat
and
very
few
of
them
were
capable
field
workers
they
were
and
had
a
certain
air
of
disappointed
eagerness
about
them
they
looked
as
though
they
had
for
ever
sought
something
and
finding
it
had
remained
unsatisfied
in
all
there
were
some
seventeen
women
who
might
have
been
regarded
as
quite
true
to
type
and
about
this
vivid
nucleus
were
clustered
nearly
a
hundred
other
women
many
of
whom
exhibited
some
characteristic
mark
of
the
same
type
while
the
remainder
perhaps
per
cent
of
the
whole
body
had
joined
the
party
out
of
bravado
to
seek
excitement
or
for
some
purpose
of
expediency
among
the
last
was
mrs
isaacson
who
was
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
jenkynite
defeat
ever
since
she
had
passed
her
examination
in
farm
supervision
mrs
isaacson
had
exhibited
an
increasing
tendency
to
rest
on
her
laurels
she
had
grown
very
stout
again
during
her
stay
in
marlow
and
complained
of
severe
heart
trouble
the
least
exertion
brought
on
violent
palpitation
accompanied
by
the
most
alarming
symptoms
the
poor
lady
would
gasp
for
breath
press
her
hands
convulsively
to
a
spot
just
below
her
left
breast
and
roll
up
her
eyes
till
they
presented
only
a
terrifying
repulsive
rim
of
white
if
the
least
exertion
were
demanded
from
her
and
yet
she
would
persist
in
the
effort
until
absolutely
on
the
verge
of
collapse
no
no
i
must
work
she
would
insist
it
iss
not
fair
to
the
others
that
i
do
no
work
i
will
try
once
more
it
iss
only
fair
at
times
they
had
to
insist
that
she
should
return
home
and
rest
and
as
the
winter
closed
in
mrs
isaacson
rests
became
more
and
more
protracted
jasper
thrale
grinned
and
said
i
suppose
got
to
keep
her
but
there
was
a
feeling
among
the
other
members
of
the
committee
that
they
were
creating
an
undesirable
precedent
mrs
isaacson
example
was
being
followed
by
other
women
who
preferred
rest
to
work
heart
weakness
was
becoming
endemic
in
marlow
then
came
the
news
that
mrs
isaacson
had
joined
the
jenkynites
the
seventeen
received
her
somewhat
doubtfully
at
first
but
the
body
of
the
sect
were
in
favour
of
her
reception
possibly
they
were
rather
proud
of
counting
one
more
fat
woman
among
them
the
average
member
was
so
noticeably
thin
even
the
seventeen
were
satisfied
within
a
fortnight
of
mrs
conversion
she
had
a
wonderful
fluency
and
she
said
the
right
and
proper
things
in
her
own
peculiar
english
a
form
of
speech
which
had
a
certain
piquancy
and
interest
and
afforded
relief
and
variety
after
the
somewhat
stereotyped
formulas
of
the
seventeen
but
early
in
december
before
the
floods
came
mrs
isaacson
was
convicted
of
a
serious
offence
against
the
community
one
of
the
committee
first
works
had
been
to
store
certain
priceless
valuables
tea
coffee
sugar
soap
candles
salt
baking
powder
wine
and
other
irreplaceable
commodities
had
been
locked
up
in
one
of
the
bank
premises
in
all
they
had
a
fairly
large
store
upon
which
they
had
hardly
drawn
as
yet
it
was
not
intended
to
hoard
these
luxuries
indefinitely
after
harvest
a
dole
had
been
made
to
all
the
workers
as
acknowledgment
of
their
services
and
it
had
been
decided
to
hold
another
festival
on
christmas
day
mrs
isaacson
with
unsuspected
energy
had
burglariously
entered
this
storehouse
of
wealth
she
had
found
an
accessible
window
at
the
rear
which
she
had
succeeded
in
forcing
and
despite
her
bulk
and
the
delicate
state
of
her
heart
she
had
effected
an
entrance
and
stolen
tea
sugar
candles
and
whisky
she
was
indeed
finally
caught
in
the
act
but
her
thefts
would
probably
have
escaped
notice
she
worked
after
dark
and
with
a
cunning
and
caution
that
would
have
placed
her
high
in
the
profession
before
the
plague
had
it
not
been
for
blanche
it
seems
that
mrs
isaacson
had
formed
the
habit
of
staying
up
in
the
evening
she
pleaded
that
she
could
not
sleep
during
the
early
hours
of
the
night
which
was
not
surprising
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
slept
much
during
the
day
and
as
she
was
diligent
in
picking
up
or
begging
sufficient
wood
to
maintain
the
fire
there
was
no
reason
why
blanche
and
millie
should
offer
any
objection
thrale
had
rigged
up
a
dynamo
at
the
mill
now
to
provide
artificial
light
and
the
hours
of
work
were
so
prolonged
that
they
were
glad
to
get
to
bed
at
seven
by
eight
mrs
isaacson
evidently
counted
herself
safe
from
all
interruption
she
might
have
continued
her
enjoyment
of
luxury
undiscovered
throughout
the
winter
if
blanche
had
not
suffered
from
toothache
she
had
been
in
bed
and
asleep
nearly
two
hours
when
her
dreams
of
discomfort
merged
into
a
consciousness
of
actual
pain
she
sighed
and
pressed
her
cheek
into
the
pillows
made
agonizing
exploration
with
her
tongue
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
again
possibly
she
might
have
succeeded
had
not
that
unaccountable
smell
of
whisky
obtruded
itself
upon
her
senses
at
first
she
thought
the
house
was
on
fire
that
had
always
been
her
one
fear
in
leaving
mrs
isaacson
alone
and
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
sniffed
vigorously
funny
she
murmured
it
smells
like
like
plum
pudding
the
analogy
was
probably
suggested
to
her
by
the
odour
of
burning
brandy
she
got
up
and
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
mrs
isaacson
slept
on
a
sort
of
glorified
landing
and
when
blanche
stepped
outside
her
own
door
she
could
see
at
once
by
the
light
of
a
watery
full
moon
that
her
lodger
had
not
yet
come
to
bed
the
smell
of
the
spirit
was
stronger
on
the
landing
and
blanche
forgetting
her
toothache
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
stole
quietly
down
the
short
flight
of
crooked
stairs
the
door
giving
on
to
the
was
latched
but
there
were
two
convenient
and
through
one
of
them
she
saw
mrs
isaacson
seated
by
the
fire
drinking
hot
tea
on
the
table
stood
an
open
whisky
bottle
and
two
lighted
wax
candles
blanche
was
thunderstruck
tea
whisky
and
candles
were
inexplicable
things
the
thought
of
witchcraft
obtruded
itself
and
so
fascinated
her
that
she
stood
on
the
stairs
gazing
through
the
knothole
until
a
sudden
rigour
reminded
her
that
she
was
deadly
cold
she
did
not
interrupt
the
orgy
she
crept
back
to
bed
and
after
much
difficulty
awakened
millie
the
sound
of
their
voices
must
have
alarmed
mrs
isaacson
for
the
girls
presently
heard
her
stumbling
upstairs
they
stopped
their
discussion
then
and
blanche
toothache
being
mysteriously
cured
by
her
excitement
they
were
soon
asleep
again
neither
of
the
girls
spoke
of
their
discovery
to
anyone
the
next
day
but
blanche
returned
to
the
cottage
at
four
when
mrs
isaacson
was
at
a
meeting
over
the
way
and
explored
her
bedroom
she
found
a
small
store
of
tea
sugar
and
candles
under
the
mattress
the
whisky
bottle
had
disappeared
and
so
came
to
an
understanding
of
mrs
isaacson
insistence
that
she
should
perform
all
work
connected
with
her
own
it
could
hardly
be
called
a
room
after
consultation
with
millie
blanche
decided
that
she
must
inform
jasper
thrale
of
the
contraband
she
been
stealing
of
course
he
said
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
bring
it
home
to
her
but
he
laughed
at
blanche
indignation
she
stealing
from
us
said
blanche
who
had
developed
a
fine
sense
of
her
duty
towards
and
interest
in
the
community
oh
yes
you
quite
right
said
thrale
i
inform
the
committee
at
least
the
the
five
were
furious
we
must
make
an
example
elsie
durham
said
it
is
that
we
shall
miss
what
the
isaacson
woman
has
taken
or
will
take
it
the
question
of
precedent
this
is
where
we
are
facing
the
beginning
of
law
is
it
somebody
has
to
protect
the
members
of
the
community
against
themselves
if
one
steals
and
goes
unpunished
another
will
steal
we
shall
have
the
women
divided
into
stealers
and
workers
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
her
asked
thrale
turn
her
out
replied
elsie
durham
the
jenkynites
wo
let
her
go
said
thrale
raising
the
larger
question
we
shall
see
said
elsie
durham
but
that
reminds
me
that
we
must
catch
the
woman
flagrante
delicto
we
must
have
no
quibbles
about
the
facts
thrale
agreed
with
the
wisdom
of
this
policy
but
refused
to
take
any
part
in
either
the
detection
or
the
prosecution
of
mrs
isaacson
they
say
its
a
job
if
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
he
argued
the
jenkynites
blazed
when
rebecca
isaacson
was
finally
caught
and
denounced
the
culprit
when
caught
in
the
act
of
entering
the
bank
premises
had
made
a
slight
error
of
judgment
and
pleaded
the
excuse
that
she
was
a
sleepwalker
and
quite
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
but
she
afterwards
adopted
a
sounder
line
of
defence
she
made
full
confession
to
the
seventeen
pleaded
extravagant
penitence
with
all
the
necessary
references
to
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
displayed
all
the
signs
that
she
would
become
fervent
in
after
the
ensanguined
ablutions
had
been
metaphorically
performed
the
jenkynites
were
enraptured
with
so
real
a
case
of
sin
they
had
been
compelled
to
content
themselves
with
so
many
minor
failures
from
grace
that
the
performances
were
becoming
slightly
monotonous
the
sister
rebecca
case
was
refreshingly
real
and
genuine
and
they
meant
to
make
the
most
of
it
also
this
case
gave
them
occasion
to
assert
themselves
once
more
against
the
opinions
of
the
community
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
seventeen
deliberately
adopted
a
practical
and
apparently
promising
policy
they
were
not
consciously
seeking
to
obtain
civil
power
as
were
the
priests
of
the
old
days
before
the
plague
the
seventeen
had
no
sense
of
the
state
as
represented
by
the
community
they
were
without
question
perfectly
sincere
in
their
beliefs
and
actions
their
fault
if
it
can
be
so
described
was
their
inability
to
adapt
themselves
to
their
conditions
they
were
as
unchangeable
as
the
old
lady
who
had
died
sooner
than
be
permanently
separated
from
the
glories
of
a
house
in
wisteria
grove
she
and
the
seventeen
and
many
other
women
in
marlow
were
demonstrating
that
rigidity
of
opinion
is
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
the
growing
state
the
same
proposition
had
been
clearly
demonstrated
by
a
few
exceptional
individuals
in
the
old
days
but
progress
was
so
slow
the
property
owners
so
content
and
the
average
of
mankind
so
intensely
conservative
that
their
arguments
received
no
attention
for
every
man
who
believed
in
the
broad
principle
of
maintaining
an
open
mind
there
were
ten
thousand
who
were
quite
incapable
of
putting
the
principle
into
practice
with
these
women
in
marlow
the
conditions
were
completely
changed
moreover
women
are
by
nature
more
than
men
in
practical
affairs
where
intuition
rather
than
the
methods
of
an
intellectual
logic
is
being
brought
into
play
new
and
wonderful
possibilities
of
adaptation
may
enter
the
domain
of
politics
the
jenkynites
and
such
individuals
as
the
late
mrs
gosling
became
suddenly
conspicuous
in
the
new
conditions
the
type
that
they
represent
can
not
persist
they
are
the
bonds
on
a
vigorous
and
increasing
growth
the
tree
will
grow
and
burst
away
all
inflexible
restraints
in
marlow
the
new
and
vigorous
growth
was
the
sense
of
the
community
the
majority
of
the
women
were
realizing
consciously
or
unconsciously
that
they
must
work
with
and
for
each
other
the
jenkynite
affair
served
the
committee
as
a
valuable
mrs
isaacson
was
free
to
do
as
she
would
while
the
discussion
raged
imprisonment
would
have
been
utterly
futile
the
committee
did
not
wish
to
punish
her
for
her
offence
against
common
property
they
merely
wished
to
rid
themselves
of
an
undesirable
member
and
to
make
public
announcement
that
they
would
in
like
manner
exclude
any
other
member
who
proved
herself
a
burden
to
the
community
the
jenkynites
were
characteristically
unable
to
comprehend
this
argument
they
had
their
own
definitions
of
heinous
and
venial
sins
definitions
based
on
ancient
precedent
and
they
counted
the
fault
of
millie
gosling
in
the
former
and
that
of
rebecca
isaacson
in
the
latter
category
they
were
not
susceptible
to
argument
as
they
saw
the
problem
no
argument
was
admissible
they
had
the
old
law
and
the
old
prophets
on
their
side
and
maintained
that
what
was
true
once
was
true
for
all
time
in
their
opinion
changed
conditions
did
not
affect
morality
if
the
need
for
labour
had
been
great
the
affair
might
have
been
shelved
for
a
time
as
of
less
importance
than
the
dominant
economic
demand
which
takes
precedence
of
all
other
problems
but
although
the
floods
had
not
yet
come
there
was
not
enough
work
for
all
the
members
of
the
community
and
this
comparative
idleness
reacted
upon
the
importance
of
the
isaacson
case
in
another
and
probably
more
influential
direction
than
the
abstract
consideration
of
justice
and
humanity
the
women
had
time
to
talk
and
a
new
and
fascinating
subject
was
given
them
to
discuss
and
they
talked
and
their
talk
ripened
into
action
the
affair
isaacson
which
included
also
the
affair
jenkyns
was
brought
to
a
climax
at
a
mass
meeting
in
the
town
hall
it
was
decided
noisily
but
with
considerable
emphasis
that
for
the
good
of
the
community
the
jenkynites
must
go
the
seventeen
were
specifically
indicated
but
it
was
understood
that
certain
of
their
more
advanced
adherents
would
go
with
them
the
jenkynites
accepted
the
decision
in
the
spirit
of
their
belief
they
were
martyrs
in
a
great
cause
they
would
leave
this
accursed
city
their
terminology
was
always
biblical
and
cast
off
its
dust
from
their
feet
although
the
roads
were
deep
in
mud
at
the
time
they
would
go
forth
to
regenerate
the
world
upheld
by
their
love
of
truth
and
their
zeal
for
the
word
only
mrs
isaacson
dissented
but
she
was
compelled
to
go
with
them
they
went
forth
in
the
rain
of
them
in
all
exalted
with
conscious
righteousness
and
faint
with
enthusiasm
the
women
of
marlow
were
kind
to
them
they
turned
out
and
jeered
the
little
procession
as
it
marched
out
of
the
town
by
the
henley
road
stole
the
tea
was
the
most
popular
taunt
and
no
doubt
the
exiles
would
have
preferred
that
the
taunts
should
have
been
cast
at
their
faith
rather
than
at
the
social
misdemeanour
of
an
obscure
convert
but
any
form
of
martyrdom
was
better
than
none
and
they
held
their
heads
high
and
sang
glory
glory
with
magnificent
fervour
i
sure
we
done
right
commented
elsie
durham
but
we
should
never
have
had
all
the
women
with
us
if
there
had
been
no
offence
against
property
that
touched
them
communal
property
i
not
sure
that
it
is
become
almost
dearer
than
personal
property
xix
on
the
flood
from
the
middle
of
november
onwards
the
river
had
been
running
nearly
and
so
much
power
was
available
that
thrale
had
been
considering
the
possibility
of
lighting
some
of
the
nearer
houses
by
electricity
he
had
made
three
journeys
to
london
and
with
half
a
dozen
assistants
he
had
rifled
two
dynamos
from
the
power
station
just
outside
paddington
and
had
brought
back
twenty
of
coal
the
dynamos
however
were
still
in
the
truck
covered
by
tarpaulin
thrale
had
decided
that
the
luxury
of
artificial
lighting
could
not
be
provided
until
all
the
grain
had
been
thrashed
and
milled
the
end
of
that
work
was
now
in
sight
and
the
accumulated
wealth
of
flour
in
marlow
was
calculated
to
be
sufficient
to
last
the
community
for
at
least
twelve
months
but
before
the
lighting
scheme
could
be
put
in
hand
a
new
trouble
had
threatened
during
the
first
week
of
december
there
was
almost
continuous
rain
and
the
river
began
to
top
its
banks
spreading
itself
over
the
meadowland
below
the
lock
and
creeping
up
the
end
of
st
street
no
serious
matter
as
yet
and
a
short
spell
of
frost
and
clear
skies
followed
but
before
christmas
heavy
rains
came
again
and
thrale
began
to
grow
anxious
the
weirs
ought
to
be
opened
he
explained
to
eileen
they
are
probably
all
up
we
need
never
be
afraid
of
shortage
here
if
we
close
our
own
weir
we
can
always
hold
up
all
the
water
we
want
is
it
serious
she
asked
not
yet
but
it
may
be
he
said
looking
up
at
the
sky
all
marlow
might
be
flooded
and
still
the
rain
fell
and
soon
the
girls
had
to
wade
through
a
foot
of
water
to
reach
the
mill
i
must
go
and
open
all
the
weirs
thrale
announced
on
christmas
eve
i
been
looking
at
a
steam
launch
over
at
the
it
in
quite
good
condition
i
shall
bring
it
up
to
the
town
and
get
enough
coal
and
food
aboard
to
last
a
week
you
not
going
alone
said
eileen
no
i
must
take
some
one
to
work
the
engine
and
the
locks
returned
thrale
i
come
announced
eileen
with
glee
thrale
shook
his
head
you
have
to
run
this
place
he
said
since
that
night
in
september
no
reference
had
been
made
by
either
of
them
to
his
strange
revelation
of
fear
they
had
worked
together
as
two
men
might
have
worked
neither
of
them
had
exhibited
the
least
consciousness
of
sex
thrale
believed
that
he
had
put
the
fear
away
from
him
and
eileen
was
content
to
wait
she
was
barely
twenty
blanche
could
run
the
mill
she
suggested
there
is
much
to
do
now
thrale
turned
away
from
her
with
a
touch
of
impatience
blanche
had
better
come
with
me
he
said
i
want
to
come
pleaded
eileen
why
he
asked
it
be
sport
i
do
care
to
trust
blanche
with
the
mill
he
persisted
she
every
bit
as
good
as
i
am
was
her
reply
he
shook
his
head
oh
look
here
said
eileen
you
might
let
me
come
or
are
you
are
you
afraid
of
of
what
the
women
will
say
she
was
standing
by
one
of
the
mill
windows
and
she
began
to
scratch
a
clean
place
on
it
with
her
nail
thrale
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
and
then
he
came
and
stood
near
her
what
is
it
he
asked
are
you
sick
of
your
work
here
i
should
mind
a
change
she
said
intent
on
enlarging
her
one
forgets
that
you
are
women
said
thrale
i
suppose
women
are
never
content
with
work
for
work
sake
if
you
like
returned
eileen
inconsequently
i
can
see
out
now
why
do
we
have
these
windows
cleaned
sometimes
you
can
have
them
done
while
i
away
he
suggested
i
coming
with
you
said
eileen
oh
you
can
come
if
you
like
he
said
he
thought
he
was
perfectly
safe
despite
this
unusual
display
of
femininity
you
have
to
run
the
engine
he
concluded
oh
i
run
the
engine
she
agreed
and
looked
down
at
her
capable
frankly
dirty
little
hands
the
weirs
at
marlow
and
hedsor
had
been
roaring
for
ten
days
before
thrale
and
eileen
began
their
journey
but
the
water
had
been
piling
up
from
below
and
the
floods
were
working
back
up
river
the
fact
that
none
of
the
weirs
above
henley
was
closed
had
served
to
protect
marlow
in
some
degree
there
were
great
floods
above
sonning
and
from
goring
to
culham
the
country
was
a
vast
sheet
of
water
this
water
however
only
came
down
comparatively
slowly
owing
to
the
dammed
condition
of
the
main
channel
and
a
greater
proportion
of
it
was
absorbed
if
the
upper
weirs
had
been
open
marlow
would
have
been
under
water
by
the
middle
of
december
not
until
the
launch
had
been
manoeuvred
with
some
difficulty
through
boulter
lock
did
thrale
begin
to
realize
the
full
significance
of
the
situation
he
had
had
very
great
difficulty
first
in
reaching
and
second
in
raising
the
paddles
of
the
taplow
weir
in
one
place
the
force
of
the
flood
had
broken
away
the
structure
but
even
with
the
relief
this
passage
had
afforded
the
pressure
of
water
on
the
paddles
was
so
great
that
he
had
been
working
for
more
than
two
hours
before
the
last
valve
was
opened
eileen
had
been
waiting
for
him
with
the
launch
warped
up
just
below
the
lock
where
the
force
of
the
stream
was
not
so
great
i
do
know
whether
we
shall
be
able
to
carry
out
this
job
remarked
thrale
when
he
rejoined
her
oh
but
we
must
she
expostulated
do
you
see
what
has
happened
he
explained
all
the
water
is
piled
up
below
us
we
shall
probably
find
the
next
locks
which
means
that
we
be
able
to
open
them
we
must
navigate
said
eileen
steam
round
them
shoot
the
weirs
oh
well
said
thrale
i
wondering
how
far
our
responsibility
goes
if
we
do
open
the
river
right
down
to
richmond
we
shall
only
be
increasing
the
flood
in
the
lower
reaches
and
there
may
be
women
living
there
after
all
marlow
is
the
only
place
on
the
river
and
there
is
another
thing
we
may
never
get
back
it
a
risky
thing
we
are
proposing
to
do
no
one
could
swim
against
this
current
if
we
were
upset
and
carried
into
a
weir
we
should
be
smashed
to
pieces
in
no
time
do
you
think
the
community
can
spare
us
bother
the
community
replied
eileen
the
community
and
its
activities
were
already
in
the
background
of
her
mind
marlow
had
receded
into
a
little
distant
place
with
which
she
was
no
longer
connected
the
world
of
adventure
and
romance
lay
open
before
her
she
wanted
only
to
explore
this
turbulent
river
widened
now
into
a
miniature
amazon
from
which
arose
the
islands
of
houses
and
trees
that
composed
the
strange
archipelago
of
maidenhead
oh
well
said
thrale
again
we
try
it
no
use
waiting
for
the
stream
to
go
down
we
better
go
on
now
shall
i
cast
off
asked
eileen
steady
steady
thrale
warned
her
the
next
quarter
of
a
mile
is
simply
a
rapid
you
must
be
ready
to
get
the
engines
going
full
ahead
the
moment
we
start
or
i
be
able
to
steer
her
and
now
we
must
both
cast
off
together
or
we
shall
be
across
the
stream
in
two
ticks
just
loosen
the
rope
round
the
cleats
and
let
go
and
then
start
the
engine
let
the
loose
end
of
the
rope
drag
till
time
to
pick
it
up
are
you
ready
all
right
cast
off
the
little
launch
swept
out
into
the
current
with
a
bound
the
instant
she
was
released
from
her
moorings
and
almost
before
the
engines
began
to
revolve
she
was
caught
in
the
rapids
that
surged
down
from
the
weir
she
was
only
a
light
draught
designed
to
navigate
the
placid
surface
of
the
summer
thames
and
when
she
entered
the
curling
broken
water
below
the
island
she
threw
up
her
nose
and
plunged
like
a
nervous
mare
full
steam
ahead
shouted
thrale
at
the
toy
wheel
eileen
nodded
crouching
over
her
little
engine
the
roar
of
the
stream
had
drowned
thrale
voice
but
she
guessed
his
order
her
eyes
were
bright
with
excitement
she
had
no
sense
of
fear
she
was
exhilarated
by
the
sense
of
rapid
movement
the
launch
indeed
was
travelling
at
a
remarkable
pace
in
the
narrow
channel
between
the
islands
and
the
town
the
river
must
have
been
running
at
nearly
ten
miles
an
hour
and
the
engines
were
probably
adding
another
eight
in
the
wide
spaces
of
the
ocean
eighteen
miles
an
hour
may
appear
a
safe
and
controllable
speed
but
this
little
launch
was
running
down
hill
she
could
not
be
stopped
at
command
and
the
restricted
course
was
beset
with
many
and
dangerous
obstacles
thrale
handling
the
little
brass
wheel
forward
was
conscious
of
uneasiness
the
launch
steered
after
a
fashion
but
he
had
little
control
of
her
the
trees
on
the
banks
appeared
to
be
flying
upstream
at
the
pace
of
an
express
train
and
ahead
of
him
was
the
town
bridge
he
decided
instantly
that
they
could
not
pass
under
it
and
put
the
wheel
over
intending
to
shoot
out
of
the
stream
into
the
calm
of
the
flood
water
over
the
new
open
bank
but
as
the
launch
turned
and
came
across
the
current
took
her
stern
and
turned
her
half
round
for
a
moment
her
lee
rail
was
under
water
and
she
trembled
and
rocked
on
the
verge
of
capsize
then
her
engines
drove
her
out
of
the
stream
and
she
righted
herself
again
and
began
to
cut
through
the
almost
still
shallow
flood
water
stop
her
roared
thrale
i
say
what
up
replied
eileen
coolly
as
she
obeyed
the
order
no
room
to
pass
under
the
bridge
said
thrale
i
suppose
have
to
navigate
as
you
call
it
go
dead
slow
and
be
prepared
to
stop
her
at
a
moment
notice
they
spent
over
an
hour
in
finding
a
passage
round
the
approach
to
the
bridge
they
had
laboriously
to
pole
the
launch
through
the
tops
of
hedges
and
in
one
place
they
were
aground
for
ten
minutes
but
after
they
had
returned
to
the
stream
once
more
they
had
a
rapid
and
easy
passage
down
to
bray
they
shot
the
great
arch
of
the
maidenhead
railway
bridge
triumphantly
eileen
said
it
was
glorious
the
weir
at
bray
proved
even
more
difficult
to
negotiate
than
the
one
above
and
by
the
time
it
was
fully
opened
the
dull
december
afternoon
was
closing
in
they
spent
that
night
moored
to
two
of
the
elms
that
ring
the
isolated
little
church
in
the
meadows
by
boveney
at
this
rate
remarked
thrale
as
they
settled
themselves
for
the
night
it
take
us
a
week
to
get
to
richmond
we
done
two
weirs
out
of
thirteen
so
far
thrale
estimate
proved
excessive
they
reached
richmond
on
the
fourth
day
out
from
marlow
having
opened
another
nine
weirs
the
one
at
old
windsor
had
been
swept
away
and
the
one
below
richmond
bridge
thrale
opened
that
afternoon
during
those
four
days
they
had
seen
few
signs
of
life
they
had
moved
keeping
to
the
main
stream
for
the
most
part
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
expanse
of
water
exploring
a
desolate
and
wasted
country
once
they
had
been
hailed
by
three
women
who
looked
out
at
them
from
a
house
in
windsor
and
shouted
something
they
did
not
catch
and
a
woman
had
been
standing
on
staines
bridge
as
they
careered
intrepidly
through
the
centre
arch
they
had
no
time
even
to
distinguish
her
dress
but
with
these
exceptions
they
might
have
come
through
the
land
of
an
extinct
civilization
devoid
of
life
a
land
in
which
deserted
houses
and
church
towers
stood
up
from
the
silver
sheet
of
a
vast
lake
that
was
threaded
by
this
one
impetuous
torrent
of
swelling
river
richmond
also
was
deserted
the
emigrants
had
passed
on
over
the
river
or
southwards
to
petersham
and
so
into
surrey
well
said
eileen
wiping
her
hands
on
a
bunch
of
cotton
waste
that
job
done
we
fairly
drawn
the
plug
of
the
cistern
now
and
how
are
we
going
to
get
back
we
find
a
couple
of
bicycles
somewhere
here
said
thrale
it
had
been
a
clear
day
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
frost
in
the
air
the
sun
was
setting
very
red
and
full
behind
the
bare
trees
across
the
river
save
for
the
gurgle
and
hiss
of
the
eddying
flood
everything
was
very
still
the
little
launch
which
had
served
them
so
well
and
bore
the
marks
of
its
great
adventure
in
broken
rails
and
bruised
sides
was
run
aground
by
the
side
of
the
bridge
thrale
was
standing
in
the
road
but
eileen
still
sat
by
her
engine
i
hate
to
leave
the
launch
she
said
after
a
long
pause
we
can
come
back
and
fetch
her
up
when
the
flood
goes
down
returned
thrale
we
done
pretty
well
the
three
of
us
yes
the
three
of
us
he
echoed
it
has
been
great
fun
sighed
eileen
thrale
did
not
reply
he
was
thinking
himself
back
into
the
past
he
saw
a
street
in
melbourne
on
a
burning
december
evening
and
the
figure
of
a
little
brunette
who
spoke
purest
cockney
and
asked
him
why
he
looked
so
glum
we
ai
goin
to
a
funeral
she
had
said
yet
afterwards
he
had
believed
that
something
had
been
buried
that
night
he
had
faced
his
own
passion
and
the
sight
of
it
had
disgusted
him
he
had
seen
the
shadow
of
a
demon
who
might
master
him
and
he
had
grappled
with
it
he
believed
that
he
had
slain
and
buried
lust
in
melbourne
ten
years
ago
it
had
not
risen
up
to
confront
him
when
the
plague
had
put
a
world
of
women
at
his
command
he
had
not
been
forced
to
fight
he
was
not
tempted
surely
the
thing
was
dead
and
buried
only
once
on
that
warm
september
night
had
he
felt
a
sudden
furious
desire
to
take
this
girl
into
his
arms
and
fly
with
her
into
the
woods
the
desire
had
come
and
gone
he
was
master
of
it
and
in
any
case
it
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
brutal
thing
he
had
faced
in
melbourne
nor
as
he
stood
now
by
richmond
bridge
watching
the
vault
of
the
sky
deepen
to
an
intenser
blue
did
the
feeling
that
possessed
him
in
any
way
resemble
that
old
cruel
passion
which
had
flared
up
and
died
surely
it
had
died
he
could
not
analyse
his
feeling
for
this
brave
companion
who
had
faced
with
him
all
the
dangers
of
the
past
four
days
without
a
sign
of
fear
she
had
made
no
advances
to
him
they
were
friends
she
might
have
been
some
delightfully
clean
wholesome
boy
and
then
his
thought
was
pierced
and
broken
by
a
horrible
suggestion
a
picture
of
the
hill
to
handy
cross
flashed
before
him
and
he
saw
a
little
lonely
figure
creeping
furtively
away
from
marlow
he
drove
his
nails
into
his
palms
and
suddenly
cried
out
what
up
said
eileen
turning
round
and
looking
up
at
him
have
you
forgotten
anything
he
stepped
into
the
boat
and
sat
down
beside
her
i
want
to
know
i
must
know
he
said
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
all
right
old
man
she
said
fire
away
i
told
you
once
that
i
was
frightened
of
you
said
thrale
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
ever
been
frightened
of
yourself
or
of
me
i
could
never
be
frightened
of
you
she
replied
and
looked
away
towards
the
rising
darkness
of
the
shadows
across
the
hurrying
river
and
i
have
been
afraid
of
myself
yet
i
do
think
would
you
be
frightened
of
me
if
i
picked
you
up
and
ran
shouting
into
the
woods
he
asked
fiercely
her
eyes
met
his
without
reserve
dear
old
man
she
said
i
should
love
it
i
so
glad
you
understand
that
was
the
one
thing
that
prevented
our
being
real
friends
i
wanted
so
much
to
be
frank
and
open
with
you
it
all
these
silly
reserves
that
make
love
abominable
now
we
can
be
two
jolly
clean
human
beings
who
understand
each
other
ca
we
and
we
shall
be
such
ripping
good
friends
always
quite
open
and
honest
with
each
other
he
drew
a
deep
sighing
breath
and
put
his
arms
round
her
drew
her
close
to
him
and
laid
his
face
against
hers
i
been
such
an
awful
ass
he
said
i
always
thought
that
love
was
unclean
been
like
that
jenkyn
woman
i
been
prurient
and
suspicious
and
i
been
like
the
people
who
cover
up
statues
but
there
was
an
excuse
for
me
and
for
them
too
i
did
know
because
there
was
no
woman
like
you
to
teach
me
all
the
women
i
known
have
been
secretive
and
sly
they
fouled
love
for
me
by
making
it
seem
a
hidden
disreputable
thing
oh
we
shall
be
ripping
good
friends
little
eileen
magnificent
friends
this
is
a
jolly
old
boat
is
it
replied
eileen
inconsequently
do
smother
me
old
man
and
i
say
do
you
think
we
be
able
to
raid
some
soap
from
somewhere
do
look
at
my
hands
you
could
be
friends
with
a
chap
who
had
hands
like
that
there
one
thing
i
like
to
remark
said
eileen
the
next
morning
there
had
been
a
frost
in
the
night
and
there
was
every
promise
of
an
easy
ride
back
to
marlow
yes
said
thrale
examining
the
deflated
tyres
of
two
bicycles
they
had
chosen
from
a
shop
in
the
high
street
we
never
have
understood
each
other
so
well
if
we
had
worked
together
on
the
same
job
said
eileen
well
of
course
not
returned
thrale
his
tone
seemed
to
imply
that
she
had
stated
a
truth
that
must
always
have
been
obvious
to
sensible
people
that
and
there
being
no
footle
about
marriage
concluded
eileen
a
third
factor
that
had
contributed
to
the
perfection
of
that
complete
understanding
was
not
realized
by
either
until
they
were
descending
the
hill
into
bisham
i
rather
wish
we
were
going
back
said
eileen
let
stop
a
moment
i
want
to
talk
we
never
thought
of
what
we
going
to
do
do
said
jasper
as
he
dismounted
well
we
just
got
to
make
an
announcement
and
that
the
end
of
it
the
jenkyns
lot
have
all
gone
it
is
the
end
it
the
beginning
replied
eileen
do
you
see
that
we
ca
even
explain
we
try
we
shall
we
shall
have
to
in
a
way
it
take
years
and
years
to
do
it
but
the
point
is
that
they
wo
understand
now
none
of
them
not
even
elsie
durham
we
are
free
any
longer
we
are
alone
she
added
bringing
the
hitherto
unacknowledged
factor
into
prominence
thrale
frowned
and
looked
up
into
the
thin
brightness
of
the
frosty
sky
yes
i
understand
he
said
it
public
opinion
that
compels
one
to
regard
love
as
shameful
and
secret
alone
together
free
from
every
suspicion
we
had
a
doubt
but
now
we
have
to
explain
and
we
ca
explain
and
we
are
forced
against
our
wills
to
wonder
whether
we
can
be
right
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
wrong
we
are
right
put
in
eileen
only
we
ca
prove
it
to
anyone
but
ourselves
and
we
should
want
to
if
we
had
got
to
live
with
them
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
one
another
thoughtfully
no
we
must
run
away
jasper
said
with
determination
after
a
pause
look
the
flood
has
begun
to
go
down
already
that
our
work
there
other
work
for
us
to
do
yet
for
a
time
they
were
silent
looking
down
on
to
marlow
and
out
over
the
valley
we
did
go
over
that
hill
said
eileen
at
last
pointing
to
the
distant
rise
of
handy
cross
no
replied
jasper
and
then
we
wo
hide
behind
hills
damn
public
opinion
oh
yes
damn
public
opinion
agreed
eileen
but
we
wo
stay
in
marlow
always
xx
the
terrors
of
spring
the
frost
gave
way
on
the
third
night
and
for
ten
days
there
was
a
spell
of
mild
weather
with
some
rain
carrie
oliver
began
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
getting
forward
with
such
ploughing
as
still
remained
to
be
done
she
proposed
to
have
an
increased
acreage
of
arable
that
year
and
less
pasture
less
hay
and
less
turnips
the
arable
was
to
include
potatoes
beans
and
peas
for
the
community
was
rapidly
tending
towards
vegetarianism
they
had
no
butcher
in
marlow
and
the
women
revolted
against
the
slaughter
of
cattle
and
sheep
they
were
hesitating
and
clumsy
in
the
attack
and
so
inflicted
wounds
which
were
not
fatal
they
turned
sick
at
the
sight
of
the
brute
agonies
and
at
the
appalling
spurts
of
blood
and
finally
when
the
animal
was
at
last
mercifully
dead
they
bungled
the
dissection
of
the
carcase
i
sooner
starve
than
do
it
again
was
the
invariable
decision
pronounced
by
any
new
volunteer
who
had
heroically
offered
to
provide
marlow
with
meat
and
even
carrie
oliver
admitted
that
it
was
a
beastly
dirty
job
only
she
added
we
to
go
on
breeding
calves
or
we
get
no
milk
an
what
are
we
goin
to
do
with
the
bullocks
the
committee
wondered
if
some
form
of
barter
might
not
be
introduced
wycombe
and
henley
might
have
something
to
offer
in
exchange
or
failing
that
might
be
urged
to
accept
these
superfluous
beasts
as
a
present
returning
the
skins
and
horns
for
which
there
might
be
a
use
in
the
near
future
sheep
must
be
reared
for
their
wool
the
clothes
of
the
community
would
not
last
for
ever
the
subjects
of
tanning
and
weaving
were
being
studied
by
certain
members
of
the
now
enlarged
committee
neither
operation
presented
insuperable
difficulties
now
that
a
certain
supply
of
food
was
provided
for
the
community
was
already
turning
its
energy
towards
the
industries
many
schemes
were
being
planned
and
debated
marlow
was
well
situated
with
such
abundance
of
water
and
wood
at
its
gates
and
the
question
of
attracting
desirable
immigrants
had
been
raised
time
was
afforded
for
the
consideration
of
all
these
schemes
by
the
great
frost
which
began
on
new
year
day
and
lasted
until
the
end
of
february
the
frost
came
first
from
the
and
for
three
days
the
country
was
changed
into
a
fairy
world
built
of
sharp
white
crystals
a
world
that
was
seen
dimly
through
a
magic
veil
of
mist
then
followed
a
black
and
bitter
wind
from
the
that
bought
a
thin
and
driving
snow
and
when
the
wind
fell
the
country
was
locked
in
an
iron
shell
that
was
not
relaxed
for
six
weeks
the
flood
had
nearly
subsided
before
the
first
frost
came
but
the
river
was
still
high
and
presently
the
water
came
down
laden
with
that
jammed
against
the
weir
and
the
mill
and
formed
a
sheet
of
ice
that
gradually
crept
back
towards
the
bridge
all
field
and
mill
work
was
stopped
and
thrale
and
eileen
spent
two
or
three
days
a
week
making
excursions
to
london
bringing
back
coal
and
other
forms
of
riches
their
fear
of
being
misunderstood
had
proved
to
have
been
an
exaggeration
in
that
exalted
mood
of
theirs
which
had
risen
to
such
heights
after
four
days
of
adventurous
solitude
they
had
come
a
little
too
near
the
stars
in
finding
themselves
they
had
lost
touch
with
the
world
elsie
durham
had
smiled
at
their
defensive
announcement
my
dear
children
she
had
said
do
be
touchy
about
it
i
am
so
glad
and
of
course
i
known
for
months
that
you
would
come
to
an
understanding
and
there
no
need
to
tell
me
that
your
agreement
did
you
say
was
entirely
different
to
any
other
i
know
but
be
human
about
it
do
apologize
for
it
by
being
superior
to
all
of
us
oh
you
a
dear
eileen
had
said
enthusiastically
nevertheless
there
were
many
women
still
left
in
marlow
who
were
less
than
elsie
durham
comparative
idleness
induced
gossip
and
there
was
more
than
one
party
in
the
community
which
regarded
thrale
and
eileen
with
disfavour
the
old
ruts
had
been
worn
too
deep
to
be
smoothed
out
in
a
few
months
however
heavy
had
been
the
great
roller
of
necessity
and
strangely
enough
the
life
of
sam
evans
at
high
wycombe
was
regarded
by
many
of
the
more
bigoted
with
less
displeasure
than
this
perfectly
wholesome
and
desirable
union
of
thrale
and
eileen
the
prostitution
of
sam
evans
was
a
new
thing
outside
the
experience
of
these
women
and
it
was
accepted
as
an
outcome
of
the
new
conditions
the
other
affair
was
familiar
in
its
associations
and
was
condemned
on
both
the
old
and
the
new
precedents
the
mass
of
the
women
were
quite
unable
to
think
out
a
new
morality
for
themselves
relief
from
all
these
foolish
criticisms
gossipings
and
false
emotions
came
when
the
frost
broke
a
warm
rain
in
the
first
week
of
march
released
the
soil
from
its
bonds
and
as
the
retarded
spring
began
to
move
impatiently
into
life
there
was
a
great
call
for
labour
but
as
the
year
ripened
the
temperament
of
the
community
exhibited
a
new
and
alarming
symptom
there
was
a
terrible
spirit
of
depression
abroad
all
nature
was
warm
with
the
movement
of
reproduction
nature
was
growing
and
propagating
thrusting
out
and
taking
a
larger
hold
upon
life
nature
was
coming
to
the
fight
with
new
reserves
and
allies
a
fruitful
and
increasing
army
eager
for
the
struggle
against
this
little
decreasing
band
of
sterile
humanity
nature
was
prolific
and
these
women
were
barren
and
in
some
inexplicable
way
the
consciousness
of
futility
had
spread
through
the
marlow
community
some
posthumous
children
had
been
born
since
the
plague
a
few
young
girls
millie
among
them
were
pregnant
but
death
had
been
busier
than
life
during
the
winter
and
from
outside
came
stray
reports
that
in
other
communities
death
had
been
busier
still
what
hope
was
there
for
that
generation
they
were
too
few
to
cope
with
their
task
grass
was
growing
in
their
streets
their
houses
were
in
need
of
repair
and
after
their
day
labour
in
the
fields
to
provide
themselves
with
food
they
had
neither
strength
nor
inclination
to
take
up
the
battle
anew
moreover
the
spice
was
gone
from
life
some
inherent
need
for
emulation
was
gone
they
were
ceasing
to
take
any
pride
in
their
persons
and
in
their
clothes
they
wore
knickerbockers
or
trousers
for
convenience
in
working
and
suffered
a
strange
loss
of
in
consequence
many
of
the
younger
women
still
returned
in
the
evenings
to
what
skirts
and
ribbons
they
still
possessed
but
the
habit
was
declining
the
uselessness
of
it
was
growing
even
more
apparent
there
were
no
sex
distinctions
or
class
distinctions
among
them
of
what
account
was
it
that
one
girl
was
prettier
or
better
dressed
than
her
neighbour
what
mattered
was
whether
she
was
a
stronger
or
more
intelligent
worker
above
all
the
woman
need
for
love
and
admiration
could
find
no
outlet
they
realized
that
they
were
becoming
hardened
and
unsexed
and
revolted
against
the
coming
change
something
within
them
rose
up
and
cried
for
expression
and
when
it
was
thwarted
it
turned
to
a
thing
of
evil
the
mind
of
the
community
was
becoming
distorted
hysteria
sexual
perversions
and
various
forms
of
religious
mania
were
rife
young
women
broke
into
futile
and
unsatisfying
orgies
of
foolish
dancing
and
women
became
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
a
male
and
human
god
even
the
committee
did
not
escape
the
influence
of
the
growing
despair
they
looked
forward
to
a
future
when
such
machines
and
tools
as
they
possessed
would
be
worn
out
and
they
had
no
means
of
replacing
them
thrale
had
reported
that
the
line
to
london
was
becoming
unsafe
for
the
passage
of
his
trucks
rust
was
at
work
upon
the
rails
rain
and
floods
had
weakened
embankments
young
growths
were
springing
up
on
the
permanent
way
and
it
was
hopeless
to
contemplate
any
work
of
repair
in
the
old
days
an
army
of
men
had
been
needed
for
that
work
alone
the
country
roads
needed
and
the
houses
restoration
they
had
not
the
means
or
the
labour
to
undertake
half
the
necessary
work
there
were
breaches
in
the
river
bank
and
a
large
and
apparently
permanent
lake
was
forming
in
the
low
meadows
towards
bourne
end
all
about
them
nature
was
so
intensely
busy
in
her
own
regardless
way
and
they
were
helpless
now
to
oppose
her
the
age
of
iron
and
machinery
was
falling
into
a
swift
decline
all
that
the
community
could
look
for
in
the
future
was
a
return
to
primitive
conditions
and
the
fight
for
bare
life
every
year
their
tools
and
machines
would
grow
less
efficient
every
year
nature
would
return
more
powerful
to
the
attack
in
ten
years
they
would
be
fighting
her
with
rude
and
tedious
weapons
of
wood
grinding
their
scanty
corn
between
two
stones
and
living
from
hand
to
mouth
in
the
bountiful
south
such
a
life
might
have
its
rewards
but
how
could
they
endure
it
in
this
uncertain
and
cruel
north
so
while
the
sun
rose
higher
in
the
sky
and
the
earth
was
wonderfully
reclothed
the
women
of
marlow
fell
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
horrors
of
mental
depression
what
had
they
to
work
for
and
to
hope
for
save
this
miserable
possession
of
unsatisfied
life
xxi
smoke
one
bright
morning
at
the
end
of
april
jasper
and
eileen
sat
on
the
cliffs
at
the
land
end
and
talked
of
the
future
ten
days
before
they
had
left
marlow
on
bicycles
to
make
exploration
they
intended
to
return
they
had
explained
they
would
be
away
for
a
month
at
the
outside
but
in
view
of
the
growing
depression
and
the
loss
of
spirit
shown
by
the
community
they
considered
it
necessary
to
go
out
and
discover
what
conditions
obtained
in
other
parts
of
england
it
might
be
they
urged
that
the
plague
had
been
less
deadly
in
other
districts
we
should
not
know
here
jasper
had
argued
there
may
be
many
men
left
elsewhere
but
they
might
not
have
been
able
to
communicate
with
us
yet
their
attention
like
ours
would
have
been
concentrated
upon
local
conditions
for
a
time
eileen
and
i
will
find
out
perhaps
we
may
be
able
to
open
up
communication
again
in
any
case
we
come
back
within
a
month
and
report
his
natural
instinct
had
taken
him
into
the
west
country
they
had
left
elsie
durham
slightly
more
cheerful
they
had
given
her
a
gleam
of
hope
given
her
something
at
last
to
which
she
might
look
forward
their
own
hopes
had
quickly
faded
and
died
as
they
rode
on
into
the
west
by
the
time
they
reached
plymouth
they
were
thinking
of
marlow
as
a
place
peculiarly
favoured
by
providence
at
first
they
had
passed
through
communities
conducted
on
lines
resembling
their
own
greater
or
smaller
groups
of
women
working
more
or
less
in
in
many
of
these
communities
a
single
man
was
living
in
some
cases
two
men
who
viewed
their
duty
towards
society
in
the
same
light
as
the
adonis
of
wycombe
but
the
unit
grew
steadily
smaller
as
they
progressed
it
was
no
longer
the
town
or
village
community
but
the
farm
which
was
the
centre
of
activity
and
the
occupied
farms
grew
more
scattered
for
it
appeared
that
here
in
the
west
the
plague
had
attacked
women
as
well
as
men
another
curious
fact
they
learned
was
that
the
men
had
taken
longer
to
die
one
woman
spoke
of
having
nursed
her
husband
for
two
months
before
the
paralysis
proved
fatal
and
if
the
depression
in
marlow
had
been
great
the
travellers
soon
learned
that
elsewhere
it
was
greater
still
the
women
worked
mechanically
drudgingly
they
spoke
in
low
melancholy
voices
when
they
were
questioned
and
save
for
a
faint
accession
of
interest
in
thrale
presence
there
and
the
signs
of
some
feeble
flicker
of
hope
as
they
asked
of
conditions
further
north
and
east
they
appeared
to
have
no
thought
beyond
the
instant
necessity
of
sustaining
the
life
to
which
they
clung
so
feebly
thrale
and
eileen
rode
on
into
cornwall
not
because
they
still
hoped
but
because
they
both
felt
a
vivid
desire
to
reach
the
land
end
and
gaze
out
over
the
atlantic
they
wanted
to
leave
this
desolate
land
behind
them
for
a
few
hours
and
rest
their
minds
in
the
presence
of
the
unchangeable
sea
let
us
go
on
and
forget
for
a
few
days
eileen
had
said
and
so
they
had
at
last
reached
the
furthest
limit
of
land
cornwall
had
proved
to
be
a
land
of
the
dead
save
for
a
few
women
in
the
neighbourhood
of
st
austell
they
had
not
seen
a
living
human
being
in
the
whole
county
and
so
on
this
clear
april
morning
they
sat
upon
this
ultimate
cliff
and
talked
of
the
future
the
water
below
them
was
delicately
flecked
with
white
no
long
rollers
were
riding
in
from
the
atlantic
but
the
fresh
april
breeze
was
flicking
the
crests
of
little
waves
into
foam
and
above
an
drift
of
scattered
white
clouds
threw
coursing
shadows
upon
the
blues
and
purples
of
the
curdling
sea
eileen
and
thrale
had
walked
southwards
as
far
as
carn
voel
to
avoid
the
obstruction
to
vision
of
the
longships
and
on
three
sides
they
looked
out
to
an
unbroken
horizon
of
water
which
on
that
bright
morning
was
clearly
differentiated
from
the
impending
sky
one
might
forget
here
remarked
eileen
after
a
long
silence
if
it
were
better
to
forget
said
jasper
eileen
drew
up
her
knees
until
she
could
rest
her
chin
upon
them
embracing
them
with
her
arms
what
can
one
do
she
asked
what
good
is
it
all
if
there
is
no
future
just
to
live
out
one
own
life
in
the
best
way
was
the
answer
she
frowned
over
that
for
a
time
do
you
really
believe
dear
she
said
when
she
had
considered
jasper
suggestion
do
you
really
believe
that
this
is
the
end
of
humanity
i
do
know
he
said
i
have
changed
my
mind
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
last
few
days
there
may
be
a
race
untouched
somewhere
in
the
archipelagos
of
the
south
seas
perhaps
which
will
gradually
develop
and
repeople
the
world
again
or
in
australia
or
new
zealand
she
prompted
we
should
have
heard
from
them
before
this
he
said
we
must
have
heard
before
this
and
is
there
no
hope
for
us
here
in
england
in
marlow
there
are
a
few
boys
infants
born
since
the
plague
you
know
and
there
will
be
more
children
in
the
future
evans
children
and
those
others
there
were
two
men
in
some
places
you
remember
can
they
ever
grow
up
it
seems
to
me
that
the
women
are
dying
they
nothing
to
live
for
it
only
a
year
since
the
plague
first
came
and
look
at
them
now
what
will
they
be
like
in
five
years
time
they
die
of
hopelessness
or
commit
suicide
or
simply
starve
from
the
lack
of
any
purpose
in
living
because
work
is
worth
while
and
the
others
the
mothers
that
have
some
object
in
living
will
fall
back
into
savagery
they
be
so
occupied
in
the
necessity
for
work
for
forcing
a
living
out
of
the
ground
somehow
that
they
have
neither
time
nor
wish
to
teach
their
children
i
do
know
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
faced
with
decrease
gradually
leading
on
to
extinction
and
i
doubt
he
continued
after
a
little
hesitation
i
doubt
whether
these
sons
of
the
new
conditions
will
have
much
vitality
they
are
the
children
of
lust
on
the
father
side
worse
still
of
tired
lust
it
does
make
a
difference
perhaps
if
we
were
a
young
and
vigorous
people
like
the
old
jews
the
seed
would
be
strong
enough
to
override
any
inherent
weakness
but
we
are
not
we
are
an
old
civilization
before
the
plague
we
had
come
to
a
consideration
of
eugenics
it
had
been
forced
upon
us
a
vital
and
growing
people
does
not
spend
its
time
on
such
a
question
as
that
eugenics
was
a
proposition
that
grew
out
of
the
necessity
of
the
time
it
was
easy
enough
to
deny
decadence
and
to
prove
our
fitness
by
apparently
sound
argument
but
to
me
it
always
seemed
that
this
growing
demand
for
some
form
of
artificial
selection
of
parents
by
restriction
of
the
palpably
unfit
afforded
the
surest
evidence
things
like
that
are
only
produced
if
there
is
a
need
for
them
eugenics
was
a
symptom
eileen
sighed
and
what
about
us
she
asked
we
happy
replied
jasper
probably
the
happiest
people
in
the
world
at
the
present
time
and
we
must
try
to
give
some
of
our
happiness
to
others
we
must
go
back
to
marlow
and
work
for
the
community
and
i
think
we
try
in
our
limited
way
to
do
something
for
the
younger
generation
perhaps
it
might
be
possible
for
us
to
go
north
and
try
our
hands
at
making
steel
there
are
probably
women
there
who
would
help
us
but
i
do
think
it
worth
while
unless
to
preserve
our
knowledge
and
hand
it
on
we
can
only
lessen
the
difficulty
in
one
little
district
for
a
time
as
the
pressure
of
necessity
grows
as
it
must
grow
we
shall
be
forced
to
abandon
manufacture
the
need
for
food
will
outrun
us
we
are
too
few
and
it
will
be
simpler
and
perhaps
quicker
to
plough
with
a
wooden
plough
than
to
wait
for
our
faulty
and
steel
the
adult
population
small
as
it
is
must
decrease
and
i
afraid
it
will
decrease
more
rapidly
than
we
anticipate
owing
to
these
causes
of
depression
and
lack
of
stimulus
oh
well
said
eileen
at
last
getting
to
her
feet
we
happy
as
you
say
and
our
job
seems
pretty
plain
before
us
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
getting
back
though
i
hate
taking
the
news
to
elsie
jasper
came
and
stood
beside
her
and
put
his
arm
across
her
shoulders
we
at
any
rate
must
keep
our
spirits
up
he
said
that
before
everything
i
all
right
said
eileen
brightly
i
got
you
and
for
the
moment
the
sea
we
come
back
here
sometimes
if
the
roads
get
too
bad
yes
if
the
roads
do
get
too
bad
and
already
the
briars
are
creeping
across
the
road
from
hedge
to
hedge
the
forest
is
coming
back
the
forest
and
the
wild
he
drew
her
a
little
closer
and
they
stood
looking
out
towards
the
horizon
in
the
the
clear
line
had
been
wiped
out
and
what
looked
like
mist
was
sweeping
towards
them
there
a
shower
coming
said
thrale
they
stood
quietly
and
let
the
sharp
spatter
of
rain
beat
in
their
faces
and
then
the
shadow
of
the
storm
moved
on
and
the
horizon
line
was
clear
again
that
a
queer
cloud
out
there
said
eileen
is
it
another
shower
she
pointed
to
a
tiny
blur
on
the
far
rim
of
the
sea
it
is
queer
said
thrale
it
so
precisely
like
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
for
a
few
seconds
they
gazed
in
intent
silence
it
getting
bigger
broke
out
eileen
suddenly
excited
what
is
it
jasper
i
do
know
i
ca
make
it
out
he
said
he
moved
away
from
her
and
shaded
his
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
momentarily
cloudless
sky
i
ca
make
it
out
he
repeated
mechanically
the
blur
was
widening
into
a
smudge
into
a
vaguely
diffused
smear
with
a
darker
centre
with
the
wind
blowing
towards
us
said
jasper
and
broke
off
yes
yes
what
asked
eileen
and
then
as
he
did
not
answer
she
gripped
his
arm
and
repeated
importunately
what
jasper
what
with
the
wind
blowing
towards
us
by
god
it
is
he
said
in
a
low
voice
disregarding
her
question
by
god
it
is
he
repeated
and
then
a
third
time
it
is
oh
what
what
do
answer
me
i
ca
see
pleaded
eileen
but
still
he
did
not
answer
he
stood
like
a
rock
and
stared
without
wavering
at
the
growing
cloud
on
the
horizon
and
then
the
cloud
began
to
grow
more
diffused
to
die
away
and
eileen
could
see
tiny
indentations
on
the
sky
line
indentations
which
pushed
up
and
presently
revealed
themselves
as
attached
to
a
little
black
speck
in
the
remotest
distance
oh
jasper
she
cried
and
her
eyes
filled
with
inexplicable
tears
so
that
she
could
see
only
a
misty
field
of
troubled
blue
it
a
liner
said
jasper
at
last
turning
to
her
he
looked
puzzled
and
his
eyes
stared
through
her
and
its
coming
from
america
do
you
suppose
the
american
women
the
boat
was
revealed
now
they
could
see
the
shape
of
her
the
high
deck
the
two
tall
funnels
and
the
three
masts
she
was
passing
across
fifteen
miles
or
so
to
the
south
of
them
making
up
channel
for
a
moment
they
felt
like
shipwrecked
sailors
on
a
lonely
island
who
see
a
vessel
pass
beyond
hail
oh
jasper
what
can
it
be
eileen
besought
him
it
a
white
star
boat
he
said
and
he
still
spoke
as
if
his
mind
was
far
away
is
it
possible
is
it
anyway
possible
that
america
has
survived
is
it
possible
that
there
is
traffic
between
america
and
europe
and
that
they
pass
us
by
for
fear
of
infection
how
do
we
know
that
vessels
have
been
passing
up
the
channel
for
months
past
why
should
we
think
that
this
is
the
first
it
is
the
first
proclaimed
eileen
i
feel
it
oh
let
us
hurry
let
us
ride
and
ride
as
fast
as
we
can
to
plymouth
or
southampton
i
know
they
be
coming
to
plymouth
or
southampton
men
jasper
men
no
women
would
dare
to
run
a
boat
at
that
pace
see
how
fast
she
is
going
oh
hurry
hurry
he
caught
fire
then
they
ran
back
to
find
their
bicycles
they
ran
and
presently
they
rode
in
silence
with
fierce
intensity
they
rode
at
first
as
if
they
had
but
ten
miles
to
go
and
the
lives
of
all
the
women
in
england
depended
upon
their
speed
and
though
they
slackened
after
the
first
few
miles
they
still
rode
on
with
such
eager
determination
that
they
reached
plymouth
at
sunset
but
they
could
see
no
sign
of
the
liner
in
the
waters
about
plymouth
they
saw
only
the
deserted
hulks
of
a
hundred
vessels
that
had
ridden
there
untouched
for
twelve
months
futile
battleships
and
destroyers
among
them
great
venomous
useless
things
that
had
become
void
of
all
meaning
in
the
struggle
of
humanity
it
not
here
let
go
on
said
eileen
jasper
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
well
over
a
hundred
miles
to
southampton
he
said
nearer
a
hundred
and
fifty
i
should
say
but
we
must
go
on
we
must
urged
eileen
it
was
evident
that
jasper
too
felt
a
compelling
desire
to
go
on
he
stood
still
with
a
look
of
intense
concentration
on
his
face
eileen
had
seen
him
look
thus
when
he
had
been
momentarily
frustrated
by
some
problem
of
mill
machinery
she
waited
expectant
for
the
solution
she
was
sure
would
presently
emerge
a
motor
he
said
speaking
in
short
disconnected
sentences
if
we
can
find
paraffin
and
petrol
and
candles
light
of
some
sort
the
engines
would
rust
but
they
clog
it
must
be
paraffin
we
clean
with
petrol
by
artificial
light
it
possible
let
try
that
night
jasper
did
not
sleep
but
eileen
as
she
sat
beside
him
in
the
softly
moving
motor
soon
lost
consciousness
of
the
dim
streak
of
road
and
black
river
of
hedge
the
moon
in
her
third
quarter
had
risen
before
midnight
and
when
they
started
was
riding
deep
in
the
sky
half
veiled
by
a
vast
wing
of
dappled
cirrus
and
that
too
merged
into
her
dream
she
thought
she
was
driving
out
into
the
open
sea
in
a
ship
which
became
miraculously
winged
and
soared
up
towards
an
but
unincreasing
moon
she
woke
with
a
start
to
find
that
it
was
broad
daylight
and
that
a
thin
misty
rain
was
coming
up
from
the
sea
the
solent
said
jasper
pointing
to
a
distant
gleam
below
them
on
the
common
they
stopped
and
stood
up
in
the
car
watching
a
distant
smear
of
smoke
that
stained
the
thin
mist
she
be
coming
up
southampton
water
with
the
lead
going
said
jasper
trying
desperately
to
be
calm
epilogue
the
great
plan
on
the
evening
of
that
day
jasper
and
eileen
dined
on
board
the
bombastic
that
latest
development
of
the
old
competition
in
shipbuilding
the
boat
that
had
made
her
first
journey
to
new
york
carrying
fugitives
from
england
in
the
days
when
the
threat
of
the
plague
grew
hourly
more
imminent
the
bombastic
had
not
justified
her
name
she
had
fled
from
southampton
without
ceremony
and
she
had
not
returned
for
over
a
year
the
apologetic
would
have
been
more
apt
and
on
this
evening
of
her
return
the
demeanour
of
that
crowd
of
quiet
serious
men
in
the
huge
saloon
gave
no
hint
of
bombast
as
they
listened
intently
to
the
rapid
story
of
their
two
and
somewhat
ragged
guests
there
was
no
hint
of
brag
or
boast
among
them
all
they
came
not
as
conquerors
but
as
friends
but
oh
it
your
story
we
want
to
hear
broke
in
eileen
at
last
she
had
been
strangely
quiet
so
far
she
had
become
suddenly
conscious
of
the
defects
of
her
dress
the
old
associations
were
swarming
about
her
eighteen
months
ago
she
had
sat
in
just
such
another
saloon
as
this
courted
and
flattered
the
daughter
of
a
great
aristocrat
a
creature
on
a
remote
and
gorgeous
pedestal
now
it
seemed
that
she
was
neither
greater
nor
less
than
any
man
present
she
was
one
of
them
not
set
apart
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
still
by
her
struggles
with
the
motor
on
the
previous
night
jasper
had
been
more
patient
he
was
not
less
eager
than
eileen
to
hear
the
explanation
of
this
wonderful
visit
of
the
resurrection
of
these
twelve
hundred
men
from
a
dead
and
silent
world
but
he
had
restrained
his
impatience
and
told
his
story
first
he
knew
that
so
he
would
be
more
quickly
satisfied
he
would
be
able
to
listen
to
men
who
were
not
tense
with
an
anxiety
to
ask
questions
they
were
sitting
now
at
one
end
of
a
long
table
in
the
saloon
after
eating
a
meal
that
had
provided
once
more
the
satisfaction
of
salt
well
said
an
american
at
the
head
of
the
table
turning
to
eileen
in
answer
to
her
protest
we
maybe
been
selfish
in
putting
all
these
questions
but
we
looking
ahead
we
are
forgetting
that
we
a
big
work
to
do
but
how
did
you
get
here
asked
eileen
impetuously
how
is
it
that
you
all
alive
well
as
to
that
you
better
ask
the
doctor
there
replied
the
american
he
a
countryman
of
yours
and
he
been
in
the
thick
of
it
and
knows
the
life
story
of
that
plague
microbe
like
the
history
of
england
the
doctor
a
bearded
man
looked
up
and
smiled
hardly
that
he
said
we
shall
never
know
now
i
hope
the
history
of
the
plague
organism
it
was
never
studied
under
the
microscope
we
were
too
busy
and
now
we
trust
that
the
bacillus
if
it
were
a
bacillus
has
encompassed
its
own
destruction
what
interests
you
however
is
that
this
sudden
miraculously
sudden
development
of
its
deadly
power
as
regards
humanity
ran
through
a
determinable
cycle
of
evolution
from
what
you
told
us
already
it
seems
clear
i
think
that
even
in
england
the
bacillus
was
losing
what
i
may
call
its
effectiveness
the
men
in
the
west
country
you
described
probably
died
from
starvation
and
neglect
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
now
in
america
both
men
and
women
were
attacked
there
was
certainly
a
greater
percentage
of
male
cases
but
i
suppose
something
like
half
the
female
population
was
infected
as
well
as
far
as
one
can
judge
the
bacillus
was
simply
losing
power
but
for
all
we
know
it
may
have
developed
it
may
be
entering
on
a
new
stage
of
evolution
and
in
some
apparently
haphazard
way
now
be
beneficial
to
man
instead
of
deadly
such
things
may
be
happening
every
day
below
the
reach
of
our
knowledge
the
little
world
is
hidden
from
us
even
as
the
great
world
is
hidden
however
he
went
on
more
briskly
the
thing
we
do
know
is
that
the
symptoms
of
the
new
plague
in
america
differed
materially
from
our
expectation
of
them
gathered
from
the
accounts
that
had
reached
us
from
the
old
world
in
england
the
paralysis
lasted
i
believe
some
hours
and
ended
in
death
in
america
the
paralysis
rarely
ended
fatally
but
it
lasted
in
some
cases
for
six
months
we
called
it
the
patient
was
perfectly
conscious
but
practically
unable
to
move
hand
or
foot
that
paresis
gave
us
time
to
do
some
very
clear
and
consecutive
thinking
i
may
remark
put
in
an
american
i
had
four
months
to
study
my
ideas
of
life
the
doctor
nodded
thoughtfully
america
is
no
less
changed
than
england
he
said
but
it
is
another
change
well
you
understand
that
we
did
not
all
get
the
plague
over
there
the
thing
was
less
deadly
in
attack
and
about
ten
per
cent
of
us
were
left
to
look
after
the
patients
and
find
food
interpolated
one
of
the
listeners
that
was
a
time
we
wo
ever
forget
agreed
another
sure
thing
said
some
one
and
a
general
murmur
of
assent
ran
round
the
table
and
all
the
machines
were
idle
of
course
continued
the
doctor
and
even
when
the
tide
of
recovery
began
to
flow
we
had
to
turn
our
attention
first
to
the
getting
of
food
if
it
had
been
for
that
we
have
been
here
before
this
said
a
young
man
i
feel
we
owe
england
and
europe
some
kind
of
an
apology
but
we
just
had
to
get
busy
on
food
growing
right
away
we
spare
a
ship
crew
till
three
weeks
ago
and
the
others
are
hard
at
it
over
there
still
put
in
another
this
is
just
a
pioneer
party
it
all
so
comprehensible
now
said
thrale
after
a
silence
but
we
had
no
idea
we
never
thought
there
could
be
any
one
living
in
america
we
thought
that
somehow
we
must
have
heard
one
forgets
we
tried
to
get
on
to
you
said
one
of
the
party
by
cable
and
wireless
we
kept
on
tapping
away
for
months
but
we
got
no
reply
we
thought
you
must
be
all
dead
too
well
we
guessed
you
were
having
a
real
bad
time
anyway
amended
another
you
see
we
knew
the
way
that
plague
had
taken
europe
but
we
kept
hoping
and
trying
to
get
on
to
you
all
the
same
we
got
a
message
for
elsie
after
all
eileen
said
to
jasper
the
next
day
there
hope
for
us
yet
yes
there
hope
said
jasper
they
had
been
up
at
the
town
railway
station
assisting
a
party
of
americans
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
rolling
stock
and
the
permanent
way
neither
could
be
pronounced
satisfactory
a
few
women
had
come
in
from
the
neighbouring
country
that
morning
attracted
by
the
sight
of
an
inexplicable
pillar
of
smoke
and
their
report
of
local
conditions
had
been
equally
uninspiring
they
had
spoken
of
famine
and
failure
but
their
faces
had
been
lit
by
a
new
brightness
at
the
sight
of
this
miraculous
little
army
of
men
there
had
been
hope
in
the
faces
and
bearing
of
these
women
faith
in
the
promise
of
support
and
succour
now
jasper
and
eileen
stood
looking
down
towards
the
harbour
the
tide
was
creeping
in
to
efface
the
repulsive
ugliness
of
the
mud
flats
and
the
sluggish
water
rippled
faintly
against
the
foul
sloping
sides
of
small
boats
that
had
lain
anchored
there
for
more
than
twelve
months
behind
them
across
the
line
was
a
row
of
unsightly
houses
hung
with
oh
there
hope
repeated
jasper
he
was
thinking
of
all
the
work
that
lay
before
them
and
yet
he
had
faith
that
a
new
and
better
civilization
would
arise
we
must
get
things
going
again
had
been
the
americans
phrase
and
they
apparently
faced
the
future
without
a
qualm
but
jasper
mind
was
perplexed
with
the
detail
of
the
mechanical
work
that
must
be
faced
detail
so
intricate
and
confused
that
he
was
bewildered
by
its
complexity
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
crux
of
the
whole
problem
lay
in
the
north
in
the
counties
of
coal
and
iron
coal
and
steel
were
the
first
essentials
he
thought
they
must
begin
there
in
however
small
a
way
and
america
must
send
out
more
men
continually
more
men
he
was
going
back
in
the
motor
with
two
experts
to
the
cable
hut
in
sennen
cove
they
were
going
to
test
the
cable
and
hoped
to
communication
with
america
and
then
more
ships
would
come
and
more
men
ever
more
men
and
even
so
they
could
do
little
at
first
and
beyond
lay
the
whole
of
europe
and
still
further
the
whole
of
asia
were
women
there
also
maintaining
the
terrible
fight
against
nature
in
the
awful
struggle
to
find
food
steel
and
coal
we
must
have
was
the
burden
of
his
thought
and
in
his
imagination
he
pictured
the
waking
of
factories
and
mines
he
had
a
vision
of
little
engines
running
eileen
thought
had
flown
ahead
with
one
magnificent
leap
she
had
passed
from
the
contemplation
of
present
necessity
to
a
realization
of
the
dim
future
and
her
thought
found
words
hope
lots
of
hope
she
said
hope
of
a
new
clean
world
got
such
a
chance
to
begin
all
over
again
and
do
it
better
no
more
sweated
labour
jasper
and
no
more
living
on
the
work
of
others
we
just
got
to
pull
together
and
work
for
each
other
if
we
can
get
enough
food
and
we
can
now
with
all
these
dear
men
come
to
help
us
we
can
do
such
wonderful
things
afterwards
there
be
lots
of
children
growing
up
in
a
few
years
time
and
we
shall
teach
them
the
things
we
had
to
learn
by
the
force
of
necessity
begin
so
differently
because
although
we
have
had
the
experience
of
all
history
we
be
bound
by
all
the
foolish
conventions
that
grew
out
of
it
such
a
silly
incongruous
growth
was
it
but
i
suppose
it
could
be
helped
in
one
way
we
were
so
penned
in
we
all
had
our
rotten
little
places
to
keep
and
that
took
all
our
time
we
never
had
a
chance
to
consider
the
broad
issues
the
real
fundamental
things
but
you
got
to
consider
the
fundamental
things
when
you
start
clean
away
from
a
new
beginning
and
oh
jasper
surely
we
have
all
learnt
certain
things
to
avoid
have
we
i
mean
class
distinctions
and
sex
distinctions
and
things
like
that
women
wo
trouble
any
more
about
titles
and
all
that
rot
now
and
anyway
there
are
any
left
to
trouble
about
and
social
conditions
will
be
so
different
now
that
there
wo
be
any
more
marriage
marriage
was
a
man
prerogative
he
wanted
to
keep
his
woman
to
himself
and
keep
his
property
for
his
children
it
never
really
protected
women
and
anyway
they
were
capable
of
protecting
themselves
if
they
been
given
a
chance
i
know
the
children
were
a
difficulty
in
the
old
days
but
they
wo
be
now
it
be
business
to
see
that
the
children
get
looked
after
and
a
woman
starve
just
because
she
has
got
a
husband
to
keep
her
she
get
better
wages
than
that
the
women
who
have
children
will
be
the
most
precious
things
we
shall
have
they
live
healthier
lives
too
and
they
wo
be
incapacitated
as
they
used
to
be
they
work
and
be
strong
instead
of
spending
all
their
time
either
in
doing
nothing
or
pottering
about
the
house
in
an
eternal
round
of
cleaning
the
stupid
ugly
things
we
used
we
shall
have
to
have
all
new
houses
jasper
when
we
get
things
going
again
oh
it
will
be
splendid
she
broke
out
in
a
great
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
we
begin
we
have
begun
jasper
nodded
it
a
wonderful
opportunity
he
said
wonderful
wonderful
repeated
eileen
we
all
men
and
women
start
level
again
equality
jasper
it
a
beautiful
word
equality
of
course
i
know
how
unequal
we
all
are
from
one
point
of
view
and
there
must
come
a
sort
of
aristocracy
of
intellect
and
efficiency
but
underneath
there
will
be
a
true
equality
for
all
that
and
we
shall
see
to
it
that
no
man
or
woman
can
abuse
their
powers
by
making
slaves
again
what
a
world
of
slaves
it
used
to
be
and
we
even
slaves
to
intellect
and
efficiency
only
to
wealth
and
to
money
and
to
some
foolish
idea
of
position
and
power
well
we
got
our
work
to
do
here
and
now
said
jasper
after
a
long
pause
work
of
course
and
i
love
it
returned
eileen
and
while
we
work
we
got
to
think
and
teach
the
tide
was
coming
in
steadily
and
near
them
an
old
boat
that
had
been
lying
on
the
mud
was
now
afloat
once
more
and
had
taken
on
some
of
its
old
dignity
eileen
pointed
to
it
we
afloat
again
she
remarked
embarked
on
the
greatest
plan
the
world
has
ever
known
added
jasper
oh
it
all
part
of
the
great
plan
concluded
eileen
the
end
